[0:24:55] <leinadtonu> @TeamDattony WTF, really?
[0:24:56] <Mr_Strut> Giving someone a seizure seems like a bad thing to do
[0:24:58] <%MoguManda> that sucks
[0:24:59] <@commanderclaw> IIRC The writer also said the clubs were almost bad enough due to the strobe lights

[0:25:40] <BentArcher> Aggressive assault on the eyes
[0:25:42] <+D00msDayDan> if you have epilepsy don't mention it on the internet or else people will send you videos to intentionally give you seizures
[0:25:44] <morningmoondude> avoid Book 1 of Korra, too :/
[0:25:46] <%mybassgotblasted9000> PLZ YAKUZA 7 PLZ
[0:25:47] <AMajorTom> They toned it down after the theatrical release
[0:25:49] <%Romuken> oh right
[0:25:51] <Make_me_mad> @PatStaresAt Let's not ignore the fact where a lot of people probably aren't aware that they could suffer a seizure from that pattern of lights, and will only find out when they suffer a seizure in Cyberpunk!
[0:25:54] <%crimsonharvest> I have an idea that the current problem can be tamed with ReShade or similar, but it seriously is a menace
[0:25:55] <dinnydanny777> Doesn't Incredibles 1 have scenes that could cause epilepsy too?
[0:25:57] <+FackinCrazy> I wonder if a bunch of people will find out they have epilepsy from cyberpunk
[0:25:57] <%AzureGale> JESUS CHRIST
[0:25:58] <%sonofthedeepsouth> That scene is great
[0:26:00] <ArcaneMusic> Pat, as someone whose sister has suffered from real bad epilepsy all her life, smart and good call. Even just doing that could really screw someone over
[0:26:02] <%Jeemukun> this shit with cyberpunk pisses me right off, my brother actually died from a seziure
[0:26:02] <%Dementedpenguin> Thanks, Pixar.
[0:26:05] <Torgue_1> Ah, shit...
[0:26:05] <%skeletonkingofmanlets> good evening patrick buddy
[0:26:09] <%BallerSwagBro9k> ITS SO BAD
[0:26:09] <%blastazoid00> WTF

[0:26:19] <%brachydios777> That scene was pretty fucked for seizure vulnerabil people
[0:26:19] <+pynkdoe> no more rapid flashing lights! society has progressed past the need for rapid flashing lights!

[0:26:53] <%kewlmyc> It was uncomfortable
[0:26:55] <Picia000123> that doggo is neat, also, is Incredibles 2 good?
[0:26:55] <%Jjrossman> The second hobbit did it to me when they zoom on Saurons eye
[0:26:56] <+Izzzyko> i was so stoned when i watched that movie i dont even rember that part
[0:27:00] <TheAdMerlin> An Anime made me realize I have a bit of epilesy, I get uncomfortable and like, really harsh stabbing pains with certain visuals. So this will be fun
[0:27:01] <+AbnormalVoid> are you sure about that?
[0:27:02] <dinnydanny777> @guardiansaiyan I remember a lot of flashing lights, cuts and laser beams I thought that was the sort of thing that causes it
[0:27:02] <%CommanderSqueaks> Again, you think part of the development process for a game would be "Hey, let's make sure none of our game causes people seizures."
[0:27:02] <@SoFarFetched> @mybassgotblasted9000 he'll continue yakuza 7 later,calm down. He needs a break from it.

[0:39:22] <Pookiedaexzile> Why you gotta hurt me Pat, I didn't take your shins
[0:39:29] <+xeros720> i mean, you're probably right and the safe solution is to just tell us to open two streams
[0:39:30] <+AbnormalVoid> like FFXIV Kappa
[0:39:33] <%TinyLittleDancer> Become anime girl Pat, they can't prove anything
[0:39:33] <heart_ablaze> fuck you twitch
[0:39:37] <%Aeoneth> You could do live audio and tell people when yo sync to
[0:39:40] <%brachydios777> THE COLE PROTOCOL
[0:39:42] <+reallybigrocks> Even if you could stream on youtube that doesn't exactly solve the DMCA issue either
[0:39:42] <%SaiyanShoto> So far I haven’t heard other streamers talk about this so I guess they don’t know about it or something

[0:41:48] <%MyNameIsRasus> fuck the music industry
[0:41:51] <%TheMattman1313> Sounds like we need to fix the DMCA
[0:41:52] <%MyNameIsRasus> burn that shit down

[0:41:56] <%KeiganOfAstora> Do what now?
[0:41:56] <cheapdoc> can we just sue the music industry, somehow
[0:41:57] <%brachydios777> Can we burn down and restart the DMCA?

[0:42:08] <%Valdorick> "need copyright freesongs? Go fuck yourself, we already claimed those too"
[0:42:09] <rekinom> It's almost like letting anyone claim things with zero consequences is a shitty way to do things
[0:42:14] <figleafplays> the DMCA isnt gonna get fixed the people who want it this way are way too powerful
[0:42:17] <KaosKuma> working as intended, giving a good suck into other people's money
[0:42:18] <$BlowFireThroatTotem> Can you safely stream songs off of Amazon Music, chat?
[0:42:20] <RajelSkoven> Does Gief already need a C-pap
[0:42:20] <+TheBitingIrish> Throw out Copyrighting altogether
[0:42:29] <heartlesshealer> @TheotherKristian This is confirmed and known
[0:42:31] <NitronStreams> dont take my word for it but from what ive read only "gaming content" is limited by twitch partnership. as long not playing a game appearantly youre allowed the stream on other platforms
[0:42:32] <%asgard147> Copyright law right now really needs to be changed limesFeels
[0:42:34] <bigshedman> Remember everyone, if you are wrongly being DMCA-claimed, just sue the person submitting the claim for perjury. It's easy to sue random strangers and/or giant record labels Kappa

[0:44:47] <%maskofmichael> No one watches me stream, so I have no fear. NO FEAR!
[0:44:58] <%crimsonharvest> On youtube the automation has lead to a death spiral
[0:44:58] <dinnydanny777> People launch copyright strikes for music that THEY HAVE SAMPLED
[0:45:04] <%ghostmcfly6> dude fuck youtube
[0:45:08] <murdock_465> trash fire is the term you're looking for
[0:45:10] <%RoninRorinth> we need to make our own streaming platform. with blackjack and no DCMAs
[0:45:17] <+xBolts4Lifex> @Pyroclase they have a feature that can disable all copyrighted music in the game.
[0:45:17] <%voidthieff> its like the human centipede
[0:45:20] <+KamenOtaku> As an American, America and all the laws therein need a reboot.

[0:45:22] <Picia000123> @Pyroclase If that DMCA preventing option won't work, it's not gonna be great

[0:45:28] <DSD24> @Pyroclase I think Cyberpunk has a streamer mode that stops licensed music

[0:45:49] <%mike2hands> OH
[0:45:51] <%baka_sugoi> video games bad
[0:45:53] <%CommanderSqueaks> That's important, so the incentive for hyper-aggressive DMCA claims like on YouTube isn't as high.
[0:45:55] <Pookiedaexzile> Its the new Swatting
[0:45:57] <+Pyroclase> At this point I have to assume there's some massive cabal of industry people leaning on youtube, it's just too bad
[0:45:59] <rekinom> "If I'm dying so are you" - big record labels
[0:46:03] <heartlesshealer> music industry most toxic industry decades running

[0:46:09] <dinnydanny777> This is all that damn Lars Ulrich's fault NotLikeThis
[0:46:11] <bigshedman> @DSD24 I hope it also stops any kind of sampled sound. People would get DMCA'd for things like rain sound effects in games.
[0:46:14] <DSD24> @PopulousNix I hope you got a good grade
[0:46:14] <%CommanderSqueaks> @Pookiedaexzile Holy shit I think that's the dumbest take I've ever seen this year, congrats.
[0:46:16] <%MyNameIsRasus> remember when the music industry claimed sites that distributed tabs freely were "basically stealing"
[0:46:27] <%adzy2k6> I've always though it a bit suspect when streamers were using copyrighted music as part of the stream. The music in games seems a bit more extreme on the other side.
[0:46:28] <%jarednotwithsubway> woo
[0:46:29] <%PanicSwytch> Where's Mixer when we need it
[0:46:30] <%XeroSigmaPrime> Twitch literally create the PAtriot AI system

[0:47:51] <skyentombment> So, what if you made a "burner" channel, and just streamed the risky shit there?
[0:47:52] <%CommanderSqueaks> Get fucked
[0:47:52] <UlriktheSlayer1> @JayEarly it has a streamer mode to mute the music and censor nudity

[0:50:26] <Visorak6> Thats an admission of guilt
[0:50:27] <Mr_Strut> We need Woolie's Third Birthday tech
[0:50:30] <%PanicSwytch> Max had to constantly turn on and off the sound for Spiderman Miles Morales
[0:50:33] <triangularblasphemy> Notice how everyone gets real pissed when one player distributes their resources among everyone else?
[0:50:36] <heartlesshealer> different people will just claim it
[0:50:36] <Gameaholic42> But even with how shit Twitch is, FaceBook live most likely still won't get a bump from it, right?
[0:50:38] <%Pappajimbo> some wack a mole shit
[0:50:38] <%crimsonharvest> The AI would submit those marginal bad faith samples for human review
[0:50:38] <%Axellogic> What if you gave up on streaming and just begged us for money on the street
[0:50:40] <dinnydanny777> You know how so many old games built their soundtracks from the same sample library? Can't wait for someone to buy it, copyright it and streaming hundreds of games becomes banned
[0:50:42] <%baka_sugoi> they'll find out one way or another
[0:50:44] <Pookiedaexzile> What if You whip your dick out and twist it
[0:50:51] <%za7az> Oh

[0:51:13] <RyuuAoi> I don't wanna get fucked
[0:51:23] <%AFlyingTaco1> Funny how Twitch is pushing this DMCA shit for videogame streamers while also featuring big music and sports streams on the main page
[0:51:24] <+REDtheBEAST> BibleThump
[0:51:25] <%MyNameIsRasus> and those still got claimed I think
[0:51:27] <%blastazoid00> Thanks for the 2020Rivalry @kitafin
[0:51:32] <RyuuAoi> I'll fuck but not the other way around.
[0:51:34] <triangularblasphemy> We're racing machines
[0:51:34] <bigshedman> These kinds of 'solutions' are just trying to resolve how horrible Twitch is being. Nobody should forget that Twitch is owned by Amazon, a corporation with an actual million billion dollars. Nobody at that fucking company can create anything better than what we have right now?!
[0:51:34] <DSD24> Or 3rd Birthday
[0:51:36] <%baka_sugoi> oof
[0:51:38] <justinjones1989> Good to see Pat roll out of bed at 7pm

[0:51:43] <%jarednotwithsubway> yeah it was nuts
[0:51:44] <%za7az> Good point Pat
[0:51:50] <%Axellogic> Mixer would have grown
[0:51:51] <%NoHoldsBarredProductions> YEAH BOTCHAMANIA
[0:51:53] <ShichiNoBushi> He had to do that with CoD: Infinite Warfare.
[0:51:54] <+xBolts4Lifex> Feels like a prime time for literally anyone else to jump in to the stream game.

[0:52:23] <CollinsOfBodom> Pointless?

[0:52:31] <%Pappajimbo> the worst part is twitch is owned by amazon a huge media distrabutor. this should have been solved years ago

[0:52:45] <%brachydios777> Wait what?
[0:52:45] <maskedmook> How would they even read the tag?
[0:52:47] <%Garthunox> you can know everything about a game and it'll still be your first playthrough
[0:52:49] <Spudnacious_Dynasty> Blind playthroughs should mean playthroughs by blind people
[0:52:50] <dinnydanny777> The Fantasia world in Kingdom Hearts is so copyright heavy that it couldn't come back for the rhythm game NotLikeThis
[0:52:51] <%CommanderSqueaks> Are you sure Pat?
[0:52:51] <%AEUG_Ace_Kamille> But... is blind an offensive term even?
[0:52:52] <justinjones1989> Bit they can't see it
[0:52:53] <+chase959> what is project wingman? sounds like a flight sim
[0:52:54] <tattleworm> it's easier to change some text in a box than actually implement better accessibility options that blind users have asked for
[0:52:56] <%R3Roundabout> no
[0:52:56] <+ImpHelpSingIt> no
[0:52:57] <SlimeSlimeSlime> "Show of Good Faith"? It's a virtue signal.
[0:52:58] <%promessav2> hmmm nope
[0:52:59] <Mr_Strut> How would they know?
[0:52:59] <%AFlyingTaco1> People were upset FOR blind people

[0:53:03] <%BallerSwagBro9k> ARE YOU SURE?
[0:53:03] <%YakumoYomi> Why would the blind care about a video streaming platform?
[0:53:04] <%crimsonharvest> its not good faith until Twitch has real accessibility options for the vision impaired
[0:53:04] <%Valdorick> Even the Blind Community is going "But fucking why though?"
[0:53:06] <danielm427> jjapanese only care if there is drugs
[0:53:07] <%bevyrage> it's just cancel culture
[0:53:08] <%BoxNavy> someone probably was i guess
[0:53:08] <krishendograv3z> Yo I saw that play through
[0:53:08] <%Psyramics> virtue signaling!
[0:53:09] <DSD24> I think Blind people have better shit to complain about
[0:53:09] <%brachydios777> NO
[0:53:10] <OblivionSword1> No one is ever upset about that
[0:53:11] <%maskofmichael> psa1guy was upset
[0:53:13] <Spudnacious_Dynasty> I wanna see blind people playing videogames
[0:53:14] <%twoto858> I guess someone was if they changed it
[0:53:18] <+Javaa01> Probably not, I would imagine blind people have a lot more important things to think about then a twitch category
[0:53:18] <%promessav2> it seems at most the blind were upset that their platform wasn't so good for them overall
[0:53:20] <UlriktheSlayer1> no but got upset for the people who werent upset, you know like how these things go

[0:53:38] <heartlesshealer> real facts
[0:53:39] <SlimeSlimeSlime> I asked a blind person to take a look at the new policy, they didn't see anything wrong with it.

[0:54:47] <+Lordgale119> @fartgasblast it's an indie game, of course it has a lower budget

[0:56:37] <@commanderclaw> It's performative wokeness
[0:56:38] <godzookylives> Cherry Popping Playthroughs
[0:56:39] <%PettyFunk> “Blind” is also a very helpful indicator to chat to NOT spoil or provide tips or advice or hints.
[0:56:44] <dinnydanny777> I think at this point that it's brave to say anything on Twitter LUL
[0:56:45] <@commanderclaw> 20 hours earlier

[0:56:59] <%sonofthedeepsouth> BURN EM
[0:57:04] <%Axellogic> We're so woke ignore the DMCA thing
[0:57:07] <%promessav2> they invented a problem to solve
[0:57:07] <%sonofthedeepsouth> IT IS ALL SO TIRESOME
[0:57:08] <murdock_465> i bet she got so many points
[0:57:09] <%rumtumtugnutz> Next thing you know they’ll want to kill speedruns because speed is a drug.
[0:57:09] <%CommanderSqueaks> NO BUT GIVE ME INTERNET POINTS
[0:57:09] <@commanderclaw> Corporate wokeness is the worst
[0:57:10] <%Razputin217> This you?
[0:57:11] <%Valdorick> Its of use to Twitches bullshit of going "LOOK AT THIS HAND, IGNORE THE DMCA HAND, LOOK! SHINY!"
[0:57:15] <%NovaKnightmare> Twitter is a cesspool of hypocrisy
[0:57:17] <%AFlyingTaco1> I sure would love to have a job at Twitch, cuz I'd get paid to do jack shit.
[0:57:17] <%asgard147> "zzzzz" psaDogchamp
[0:57:18] <%sonofthedeepsouth> IT'S NOT THAT SENSITIVE
[0:57:18] <Mr_Strut> What you don't like companies using demographics of people as props for social clout?
[0:57:20] <%TheMattman1313> This can't get you DMCA'd

[0:57:54] <RyuuAoi> Get with the times...no going back
[0:57:57] <ShichiNoBushi> When "retarded" became offensive, people used "special needs" for the mentally impared. Now that is used in a negative way. You cannot win this.
[0:57:58] <%KikioJane> Not sure if im thinking about the same person but don't they work for twitch so they were probably payed to say that

[1:00:35] <%Sick_Haystacks> just amazing
[1:00:36] <UlriktheSlayer1> thats basically most people on twitter yeah
[1:00:39] <@commanderclaw> For me it's schizophrenia. People telling me what terms to use or not use

[1:01:12] <marvel877> My OCD/Anxiety/Depression all together has been at an all time high this past year. ALWAYS ON EDGE.
[1:01:16] <+DeadlyPeaks> Came out as ace to my sister. She told me it wasn’t a thing I was just broken
[1:01:16] <taro_m> People that say that are just waste of oxygen slacktivists that do this just to feel better about themselves. You will ALWAYS be accused of being offensive in some way, no matter you do. So you might not care about them at all
[1:01:18] <%king_wragles> The most broken woman on Twitch one shot the most busted boss in Bloodborne

[1:01:23] <%Agami23> brolylegs is a legend
[1:01:26] <DrAlbertWily> It blows chunks.
[1:01:27] <%SirGO0SE> handicap people figure it out unless their problem is epilepsy in which case fix your fucking game
[1:01:28] <nmaten> brolylegs is the goat
[1:01:30] <+AllenAfro> how about we let them speak for themselves
[1:01:31] <BoneBagMel> Accesibility is not the same as Making thigs easier
[1:01:32] <%Jack8274> I can't play PVP games because of my mental health. It's just how it is
[1:01:33] <%MyNameIsRasus> It's patronizing
[1:01:34] <BlueLunecy> Isn't there a pro speedrunner with like one hand
[1:01:34] <%Garthunox> @PatStaresAt Genuine question here Pat, is the whole "What if i need it later" thing part of the ocd, like i get it, but im genuinely curious if its due to your ocd
[1:01:35] <%Frost_Quill> @guffbud The dog started FREAKING OUT yesterday on stream because of an image on Pat's t.v.
[1:01:37] <+YharnamNighthawk> brolylegs is from my area
[1:01:39] <%Mrbaconator> i don't think condescending is strong enough term
[1:01:41] <%EuropanLamprey> I like that Dunky Sekiro Speedrun video as a passive aggressive response to that
[1:01:48] <+YabbaTroll> what about the poor game reviewers?
[1:01:49] <%NovaKnightmare> its ironically super bigotted
[1:01:50] <%Valdorick> "No no, disabled person doing what I'm saying you can't do, stop doing that, I need to defend you."
[1:01:51] <+Javaa01> Just admit that you suck at the game and move on, don't make it about other people
[1:01:51] <%BoxNavy> yes :)
[1:01:51] <justinjones1989> No play with your face loser
[1:01:51] <%sonofthedeepsouth> YES THEY THINK THAT
[1:01:52] <+YabbaTroll> give them a chance
[1:01:53] <%baka_sugoi> too many woke ppl
[1:01:54] <$narfi_steadfast> Hey Pat thanks again for covering 13 Sentinels I just finished and it was the most amazing story I've experienced.
[1:01:54] <UlriktheSlayer1> THEYRE LITERALLY CALLED BLIND LIKE
[1:01:56] <+xBolts4Lifex> @BoneBagMel he's talking about difficulty though. Not accessibility
[1:01:56] <+AllenAfro> we shouldn't be deciding what is best for them they can make their own decisions
[1:01:58] <+Lordgale119> and that guy who 3d printed a switch controller mod to let him play BOTW one-handed
[1:01:59] <%crimsonharvest> im actually disabled, i pay for this sub with the twitch prime i get for 50% off because of being disabled, those fucks infuriate me
[1:02:00] <%sonofthedeepsouth> ITS BIGOTTED
[1:02:00] <%A_DEAD_SHOW> That's a great point actually
[1:02:01] <+brightman42> I mean one of the big advocates for that was also disabled
[1:02:02] <chaumiester> Yes, they do think that
[1:02:02] <RyuuAoi> @patstaresat what I learned about Americans in 2020, they love to cry freedom of speech until it's going against their personal views.
[1:02:04] <%cobalt_phoenix_> no but make it easier for me- I mean them tho
[1:02:04] <UlriktheSlayer1> HOW IS BLIND LIKE DEROGATIVE
[1:02:05] <%promessav2> they want to be a hero but they are ostensibly not good people so they go to that
[1:02:06] <+TheotherKristian> Please shut up, all of Twitch
[1:02:08] <%CommanderSqueaks> "Hey, I have no professional, educational or personal experience with this topic, but let me speak to it like I know what the fuck I'm talking about."
[1:02:08] <@commanderclaw> Passive Progressivism is the worst
[1:02:08] <%Frost_Quill> @Garthunox At the very least it makes his OCD worse.
[1:02:09] <%Jack8274> They do it because they are suffering Pat
[1:02:09] <+Pyroclase> Don't get offended for other people.
[1:02:10] <+Admiral_PopnFresh> well, people don't tell Indigenous people or black people that they shouldn't refer to themselves as Indians or the N-word, but OCD isn't easily visible like race
[1:02:10] <%brachydios777> LET THEM SPEAK FOR THEMSELVES
[1:02:11] <%maskofmichael> I like how my silly joke sent you on a long rant
[1:02:12] <+Pyroclase> It's a waste of energy.
[1:02:13] <%adzy2k6> Like that blind guy who stears the ship in that pirate game
[1:02:14] <ShineTheDiamond> @marvel877 Same. This pandemic has been hell for the nerves
[1:02:16] <+Javaa01> Societal Scrubquotes
[1:02:16] <chimeraxmachina> I love these pre game talks a lot
[1:02:18] <dizimous> Blind even has a secondary definition that is extremely appropriate for describing a playthrough
[1:02:18] <%Garthunox> "In case of Evil/Better Pat"
[1:02:23] <%derekwst3> @PatStaresAt how would blind people WATCH the stream?
[1:02:24] <+xeros720> seriously, the response should be, make sure you can remap buttons in your game
[1:02:25] <+brightman42> wait, so people are cancelling "blind playthrough" now?
[1:02:26] <%adzy2k6> His friends yell out where to go, and he stears
[1:02:27] <Rashnam> difficulty isn't the problem, it's non-rebindable keys/buttons
[1:02:32] <%chambatron> Just tuned in is this about the blind playthroughs?
[1:02:35] <%ClericOfSparda> I find it strange that there's people who don't believe you have OCD
[1:02:37] <+eanscrale> wait what
[1:02:37] <%Neryl_> D:
[1:02:37] <taro_m> its just feel-good slacktivism

[1:28:17] <triangularblasphemy> @taro_m Prez is a million dollar idea. I'm shocked that Ace Combat didn't get a VA co-pilot, and that they went with multiplayer as opposed to rogue
[1:28:18] <%Cozy90> OH NO

[1:28:43] <yourliteraldog> Empty his balls on a wii
[1:28:53] <%Lordgale119> do we have a way to get pat to actually see Prez's dialogue?
[1:28:54] <dinnydanny777> The WiiU sounds too close to PeeU
[1:29:01] <dinnydanny777> Like when something is stinky
[1:29:04] <%ThiccholasKappa> ThiccholasKappa subscribed at Tier 1. They've subscribed for 4 months! nobody ever expects the resub during piss time

[1:30:40] <triangularblasphemy> f-freckles???
[1:30:48] <dinnydanny777> I can't believe nobody came out with a counter to the WiiU, no one invented a PoopU or anything, what a wasted opportunity
[1:30:51] <%Lordgale119> also why hasn't any AC game been ported to the switch yet? I'd love to do controller gyro controls for stick and throttle
[1:31:12] <huskarl_zap> is it me or is the music super cursed and playing backwards at certain points?
[1:31:17] <%Too_Much_Nukie> Because the Switch could not handle the graphics.
[1:31:30] <triangularblasphemy> @Lordgale119 AC lives in a world like mecha games or RTS. We fans love them to death, but we appear to exist on a different plane of reality
[1:31:36] <%Lordgale119> AC4, 5, 0 and 6???
[1:31:38] <taro_m> Yeah, too bad the F-15 ACTIVE is not correct and is single seat. If it was two-seater as it's supposed to be we would have endgame plane to take Prez in on the missions
[1:31:42] <huskarl_zap> lol wtf
[1:31:44] <ArcaneMusic> Hey active watcher stream gang, is there a name for the break music?
[1:31:48] <%speaks2much> Thanks for the 2020Rivalry @thiccholaskappa TYVM may you continue to prosper.
[1:31:51] <%Lordgale119> yeah, really POWERFUL graphics there
[1:31:58] <%Too_Much_Nukie> The old AC games haven't been ported period.
[1:31:59] <ArcaneMusic> I've been trying to find it while I've been catching up on yakuza streams
[1:32:09] <%thedankestmeeme> wait is he alreadfy done?
[1:32:12] <triangularblasphemy> I've talked with friends about AC, and they say "Why would I want to pilot a plane? I want to do things myself"
[1:32:14] <%Too_Much_Nukie> They don't really do re-releases of old AC games. They're too niche.
[1:32:17] <CrankyVT> I'd argue that PW beats AC's gameplay by a country mile
[1:32:24] <triangularblasphemy> I mean, there isn't any accounting for taste, but it always burns me a bit
[1:32:26] <%HefestoForges> I literally just noticed elmo has a boxcutter, any backstory on that?
[1:32:31] <%Ner234> @thedankestmeeme He hasn't started
[1:32:33] <+guynormus69> kono said ace combat ps2 games will probably never get rerelease/remaster because of licensing
[1:32:34] <%Lordgale119> Namco put 6 and 5 on XB1 and PS4 and then refuse to release them outside a preorder
[1:32:39] <CrankyVT> No built in High-G turns you can abuse, and there's no gimmick missions so it's just pure air combat
[1:32:40] <%Lordgale119> like thy don't want my money or something
[1:32:43] <%WritebroAlpha> @triangularblasphemy that legitimately took weeks off of my lifespan just now
[1:32:58] <triangularblasphemy> @WritebroAlpha Stick around, we'll age you rapidly
[1:32:59] <dinnydanny777> When I see AC I think of Armored Core BibleThump

[1:43:15] <dinnydanny777> You ever think about how many people the main characters in Ace Combat kill LUL
[1:43:17] <marvel877> When do the aliens from ID4 show up?
[1:43:24] <%promessav2> i think it's actually just 7 with check pouints
[1:43:24] <dinnydanny777> It's gotta be like in the hundreds at least LUL
[1:43:29] <+Admiral_PopnFresh> don't forget bombs
[1:43:31] <%Bailey__gaming> how many fooking missles can this plane hold?
[1:43:33] <Triplicat> yeah but war is hell
[1:43:33] <%CrankyVT> Oh btw chat, missions also get fairly long in this compared to AC
[1:43:36] <DSD24> "Did you know that there's three kinds of Aces?"
[1:43:38] <$KnivesEve> whats this game available on?

[1:44:35] <+allups> is this for arcade folks or sim heads
[1:44:37] <%AEUG_Ace_Kamille> Are the wingmen more useful than in Ace Combat?
[1:44:38] <%OperatorJo_> nanomachines, of course
[1:44:39] <+guynormus69> i want to say checkpoints in AC first appeared in Joint Assault, and it was basically necessary to beat the final boss on the hardest difficulty
[1:44:42] <+trav2_> 🤢
[1:44:43] <%CrankyVT> @jgTone 21 missions that runs upwards of 8+ hours, also a literal roguelike mode
[1:44:43] <%Deft_Thought> I was talking to a friend about this game and realized that even if its great, gameplay wise, its not gonna have the Ace Combat soundtrack going for it
[1:44:44] <vulkans2> they have those tiny missile factories installed

[1:45:02] <triangularblasphemy> @lickios47 We don't have a new AC currently, and this REALLY beats waiting for the one game series that scratches the itch
[1:45:02] <+seoliart> BRRRR
[1:45:04] <%Divryne> This game is secretly a Touhou game.

[1:45:48] <Lanka14> GUNS GUNS GUNS
[1:45:48] <%AncelDeLambert> so this is just more Ace Combat, huh?
[1:45:51] <+guynormus69> this game is more like AC6, you still get some points when allies get kills
[1:45:52] <triangularblasphemy> Is playing this causing Pat's mind to falter?
[1:45:53] <DSD24> "Time to put down some wild dogs"
[1:45:53] <%BallerSwagBro9k> BRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRR
[1:45:54] <skyentombment> AHHHHHH WINGMAN!
[1:45:55] <triangularblasphemy> Could be a good thing

[1:46:10] <stevenlambchops> I really love that the WSO talks in this game
[1:46:12] <+jgTone> that gun counter is going down a lot slower then the actual amount of bullets being fired lol
[1:46:13] <The_500lb_Child> is there a cockpit view in this game?
[1:46:16] <%The_Protagonist> psaJpeg psaJpeg psaJpeg

[1:46:27] <huskarl_zap> lol those missiles missed
[1:46:29] <triangularblasphemy> @The_500lb_Child Yup! Only way to play ;)
[1:46:30] <%AncelDeLambert> does this have advanced controls like Ace Combat does?
[1:46:30] <VioletRosefall> only thing I feel this is missing is the epic AC music
[1:46:33] <%Romuken> so when do we reach the dating sim where you're the wingman
[1:46:34] <%promessav2> yeah there's cockpit, the lightning is good but the instr8uments don't woerk
[1:46:38] <%Jaxnos> pew pew the planes go kapow

[1:46:59] <The_500lb_Child> @triangularblasphemy too true. :D
[1:47:03] <%adzy2k6> I always feel that the flight characteristics in these games could use being a tad more realistic

[2:10:07] <%sonofthedeepsouth> BRRRRRRRRRRR
[2:10:12] <%CrankyVT> @Lancaster_H Sure thing! This game also has VR support if you want to go all in on that
[2:10:15] <%Ipsenscastle> this looks awesome, i was expecting some jank from an unknown studio, why does this seem so polished?
[2:10:16] <+MisterAvry> nice move
[2:10:18] <%Deano8817> @triangularblasphemy oh I already know all about the other ones, at least the ones that show up in Ace Combat. Foxhounds are some speedy bastards
[2:10:18] <%rdark_ksu> man dogfights like havent really been a thing for awhile but fuck are they cool
[2:10:21] <%BallerSwagBro9k> This game looks decent
[2:10:21] <Profmcstevie> As someone who knows zero things about what makes a good dogfighting game good.....this looks neat sipsipHellmo
[2:10:29] <%promessav2> @triangularblasphemy i heard israel clocked a mig 31 at mach 3, it's enginjes were probably toast after but damn
[2:10:37] <UlriktheSlayer1> thanks anakin
[2:10:44] <ToneBacas> what happens to stray missiles and bullets? would they hit people down at ground level if they happened to be there?
[2:11:02] <%promessav2> @ToneBacas don't worry about it
[2:11:04] <%BallerSwagBro9k> @rdark_ksu oh they still happen in a country or 2. Its just not very much in the news
[2:11:10] <%BinaryFireball> this plane kinda looks like a hotdog
[2:11:11] <+guynormus69> important distinction for anyone wjo likes flight sims: this is FLIGHT ACTION so it's more cool shit than realism
[2:11:13] <%Divryne> You can hold triangle to look at the target.
[2:11:17] <+PenmanLupine> I want a good Robotech game now
[2:11:18] <triangularblasphemy> @promessav2 Gotta be fast to stop nuclear strikes. Every second means that the payload leaves the bay, and once that happens a couple hundred thousand random people are going to be erased
[2:11:22] <%BinaryFireball> I cant unsee it's hotdog goodness
[2:11:23] <%Deano8817> @ToneBacas Civilian casualties are just a bonus
[2:11:39] <ToneBacas> D:
[2:11:50] <mortificent> @deano8817 I see you, US Army
[2:11:51] <%rdark_ksu> @BallerSwagBro9k oh yea i just ment in general but they still hanging on in a place or two.
[2:11:58] <%fakeburg> This is the first time I'm actual feeling motion sickness from watching a flying game.... Hmmm interesting.
[2:12:38] <%sonofthedeepsouth> HE FLEES
[2:12:42] <%BinaryFireball> @fakeburg I see what you mean but I like the feeling in this case
[2:12:44] <+reallybigrocks> So is this just another arcadey action plane shoot 'ems like Ace Combat and HAWX?
[2:12:46] <%BoxNavy> good trick i hear
[2:12:47] <SauceJockey> pat the gun crosshair is the circle not the W
[2:12:47] <%blaggablag> btw later on this game has some BANGER themes
[2:12:48] <SauceJockey> please
[2:12:48] <triangularblasphemy> @PatStaresAt The green ring is your targeting reticle for guns
[2:12:49] <%sonofthedeepsouth> HE DED
[2:12:51] <dinnydanny777> Well it's a good trick
[2:12:53] <+spacenoido> SPLASH PogChamp
[2:12:59] <+akumakins> Is this the new Ace combat?
[2:13:04] <triangularblasphemy> Sorry man, just checking
[2:13:07] <%BoxNavy> fucks 2
[2:13:07] <%CrankyVT> Yeah, your missiles are normally going to miss if they're pulling a loop
[2:13:07] <triangularblasphemy> No harm meant
[2:13:09] <$Raikouija> Boom SHAKALAKA
[2:13:11] <%toastybites> wait why does a plane need ground cameo
[2:13:14] <%fakeburg> @BinaryFireball Same makes it feel oddly realistic
[2:13:17] <triangularblasphemy> Mmmhmmm, gets easier
[2:13:18] <Sullry> Yeah this is just a ace combat game made by some guys from /aceg/
[2:13:18] <%Lordgale119> @reallybigrocks it began when AC7 wasn't even announced
[2:13:23] <%BoxNavy> NotLikeThis
[2:13:29] <+CSNG> Is the audio intentionally a little muffled?
[2:13:30] <triangularblasphemy> THERE we go
[2:13:31] <+MisterAvry> BRRR
[2:13:32] <%Lordgale119> because of the lack of good AC games
[2:13:38] <+Pyroclase> oh that mountain didn't look great
[2:13:40] <UlriktheSlayer1> @toastybites so it has camo when landed and maybe cuz it looks cool
[2:13:41] <%blaggablag> NICE
[2:13:42] <%SirGO0SE> MercyWing1 psaCaw
[2:13:47] <$zyberion626> @toastybites in case you're not being facetious it would be to conceal it while it's one the ground
[2:13:49] <+Madhermit95> Use MLAA pls
[2:13:59] <user_naim> Man this looks sick
[2:14:05] <Arrowpoison1> Nice
[2:14:12] <+Madhermit95> This game is fun
[2:14:14] <%sonofthedeepsouth> federation btfo
[2:14:23] <triangularblasphemy> @toastybites its an old holdover from dogfighting. When you are turning and burning, trying not to die, you really can be fooled by that shit
[2:14:27] <triangularblasphemy> Does nothing for radar though
[2:14:28] <Sullry> Does pat know about prez and the two seater planes?
[2:14:39] <%sonofthedeepsouth> PRIVATE
[2:14:40] <GameOver_Here> God I love these types of games. I beat AC7 4 times on Ace difficulty.

[2:15:03] <+Pyroclase> I wanna see that cruiser
[2:15:04] <+guynormus69> later on in the game you can replace flares with a module that enables post'stall maneuvers
[2:15:21] <$zyberion626> that man had a family
[2:15:27] <%SirGO0SE> CurseLit speen CurseLit
[2:15:28] <+allups> looks amazing
[2:15:29] <triangularblasphemy> Fuck being in a downed fighter would suck
[2:15:31] <42nfl19> Wait I am actually listening to the words now, is this still in the Ace Combat universe? What is going on?
[2:15:31] <+MisterAvry> that's an especially bad way to go down looks like
[2:15:32] <JetpackMcQuack> flip him off on the way by
[2:15:38] <%blaggablag> it's so satisfying tho
[2:15:39] <triangularblasphemy> You're on fire, you're spinning so hard your blood isn't pumping right

[2:15:55] <fabo_joyful> !uptime
[2:15:55] <@Moobot> I've been playing this game for how long? Oh only 2h 16m.
[2:15:59] <Hoanui> It's legally distinct ace combat
[2:16:02] <+Madhermit95> Different universe from AC
[2:16:03] <%blastazoid00> Man this is just ace combat
[2:16:05] <triangularblasphemy> Reaching for the eject is a trial
[2:16:17] <42nfl19> But it has the word Oceana?
[2:16:21] <42nfl19> so same lore?
[2:16:24] <$Raikouija> Indie dev’s love letter to ace combat
[2:16:29] <$Raikouija> Nope
[2:16:32] <+guynormus69> @42nfl19 this is an ace combat fan game, set in an alternate earth
[2:16:40] <%shurtal> Yo, Halo Infinite just got pushed back to Fall 2021, AT THE EARLIEST. man that game must have been FUCKED
[2:16:44] <+guynormus69> you're probably thinking of Osea
[2:16:47] <$zyberion626> WOW
[2:16:50] <%sakeydo> Is anyone else dizzy as fuck! Watching this? Lol
[2:16:50] <%king_wragles> DEAD AS FUCK
[2:16:57] <$zyberion626> fuck that one plane in particular
[2:16:58] <+reallybigrocks> There's like 4 different games series now that are basically exactly this same thing lol
[2:16:58] <+IntrepidEye> that guy got FUCKED
[2:16:58] <triangularblasphemy> @shurtal Take notes, Cyberpunk
[2:16:58] <%blaggablag> I can't deal with the AWACS voice in this game. He has too much swagger.
[2:17:04] <%SirGO0SE> yknow "fan games" usually dont make me wonder if its better looking than what its based on...
[2:17:08] <SauceJockey> iirc the setting this is in is called the "world on fire" or something like that
[2:17:08] <$Raikouija> At what point does a fan game become a tribute/spiritual successor
[2:17:15] <%king_wragles> @zyberion626 I counted 5 hits LUL
[2:17:17] <Louie_Salmon> @shurtal Even with the pandemic, that's such a huge jump

[2:17:24] <%promessav2> oh there's the aliens
[2:17:25] <%Le_Tico> @shurtal how much you wanna bet they're gonna cancel the xbone version cause im sure its holding it back

[2:19:26] <+MisterAvry> I would have honestly done something pretty similar
[2:19:32] <@Pandora_Prime> Load a nuke.
[2:19:32] <%Divryne> They go in order.
[2:19:34] <%promessav2> gunpods for aa
[2:19:41] <%CrankyVT> Yeah, each slot has its own selection
[2:19:43] <triangularblasphemy> @Catpurnicus A pricey missile
[2:19:55] <%promessav2> yay
[2:20:01] <%BoxNavy> you did it......
[2:20:07] <+guynormus69> @patstaresat for the airships you need to destroy all of the guns and shit before you can take it down
[2:20:07] <%sonofthedeepsouth> LUL
[2:20:10] <NavigatorBR> Did he just leave without taking flares?
[2:20:15] <%promessav2> you can stack multiples of some weapons for good effects
[2:20:19] <SauceJockey> its automatic
[2:20:25] <%Daxalog> It will be okay
[2:20:28] <+Billyfig1> same
[2:20:31] <%SirGO0SE> if it sucks hopefully it sucks and runs
[2:20:33] <Profmcstevie> Most people put down a game that sucks after like 5
[2:20:34] <taro_m> now you can fire 4 MLAA missiles at the same time
[2:20:35] <+JackalKing> Pat, you dont have to play it for 100 hours if it sucks
[2:20:36] <%Romuken> oh so can you stat missile weapons for multiple lock ons?
[2:20:36] <ScreamLord> So are all the planes in this realistic or can you get the SSR Normandy in this?
[2:20:36] <%maskofmichael> You say as you play this
[2:20:36] <%greasypete00> i saw that one screenshot of the map on twitter and it looked really busy
[2:20:47] <KingVantq> the only bad things I've heard are its buggy and glitchy
[2:20:53] <triangularblasphemy> Pat might have to because he knows he'll get views

[2:20:53] <UlriktheSlayer1> i dont expect bad but bugs

[2:21:58] <%promessav2> my test for new drugs was that i could still play this game with them
[2:22:04] <heartlesshealer> Not even male hookers
[2:22:07] <%promessav2> so i think i could drive a car
[2:22:13] <triangularblasphemy> @PatStaresAt You have the brain rot because of blood running to your feet. Tense your abs and your legs to keep blood under the g force, basic plane tech

[2:22:44] <+guynormus69> if you have to ask, it's not going to hit
[2:22:55] <NavigatorBR> Then get an A-10 and just idle that thing...
[2:23:11] <triangularblasphemy> The harrier expy idles real good
[2:23:18] <triangularblasphemy> Makes you a missile magnet however
[2:23:21] <%Lordgale119> @sonofthedeepsouth more like the capitalist union tbh
[2:23:22] <%promessav2> @NavigatorBR even better, the harrier has a super broken hover function
[2:23:24] <heartlesshealer> @UlriktheSlayer1 I said "so far". Maybe more on release, but not at the moment
[2:23:29] <triangularblasphemy> Uncle Viper said: speed is life
[2:23:31] <%EternalJedi> limesPoggers F-4 Phantom 2!
[2:23:35] <+guynormus69> WAS THAT AN AC4 REFERENCE
[2:23:38] <%promessav2> @NavigatorBR but i would like an a-10 too
[2:23:41] <heartlesshealer> @triangularblasphemy hopefully full release will be different
[2:23:41] <NavigatorBR> @Profmcstevie Oh that's great.
[2:23:55] <%promessav2> this game has all the references
[2:23:59] <heartlesshealer> @triangularblasphemy but also AAA, so scraping the hope barrel
[2:24:09] <+SFdvus> this looks just like ace combat 7
[2:24:19] <triangularblasphemy> @heartlesshealer Different as in adding more romancable males? I have faith in bug fixes, but yikes
[2:24:24] <NavigatorBR> @promessav2 I played almost the entire campaign of AC7 on easy with an A-10. It was fucking fun as shit.
[2:24:30] <+spacenoido> CLEAN
[2:24:36] <%Lordgale119> I TOLD YOU GUNPODS OP
[2:24:37] <Lanka14> HPG HPG HPG
[2:24:38] <%BTR_NOODLE> BTR_NOODLE subscribed with Prime. They've subscribed for 11 months! 
[2:24:39] <%promessav2> they toned it down, but whern i played it it was for sure orange ace combat 7
[2:24:45] <%Romuken> big gun
[2:24:53] <Lanka14> aw fuck i messedup
[2:24:56] <+guynormus69> MGP is the best
[2:25:01] <heartlesshealer> @triangularblasphemy personally just hope in rando male NPCs in more bottoms than just "pants"
[2:25:11] <triangularblasphemy> @heartlesshealer Somebody has to beat Garrus in the next decade. Hades can't be the only contender
[2:25:12] <+spacenoido> Pog
[2:25:14] <%derekwst3> we need a battle royal air plane game
[2:25:15] <%greasypete00> pew pew
[2:25:21] <%SirGO0SE> PogChamp
[2:25:35] <%Romuken> BRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRT
[2:25:35] <%Jack_of_No_Trades> love that brrrrrrr
[2:25:38] <Giztech> sound like he is shooting tic tacks at them
[2:25:42] <%derekwst3> get 100 people to shoot each other down
[2:25:47] <%BoxNavy> what??? really??????
[2:25:49] <triangularblasphemy> The Gs have sapped his brain of all oxygen
[2:25:52] <+pmtriox> no, he blasts his asshole out rapidly
[2:25:52] <akitanito> that's a strong gun
[2:25:57] <+BigBruthaThunda> that's how it shoot
[2:25:57] <triangularblasphemy> He's going hypoxic
[2:26:00] <%greasypete00> guns guns guns\
[2:26:10] <+seoliart> GUNS GUNS GUNS
[2:26:21] <JayEarly> 10 years past Mass Effect’s relevance people still wanna fuck the lizard man
[2:26:22] <+guynormus69> guns guns guns!
[2:26:25] <heartlesshealer> @triangularblasphemy There should be, probably just not this soon I guess
[2:26:35] <%Ipsenscastle> @heartlesshealer I'm disappointed that there's only one type of vagina - I don't really see why there's customisable genitals at all other than to fuel clickbait, but if you're gonna do it, at least do it well
[2:26:39] <heartlesshealer> the lizard man was great
[2:26:53] <triangularblasphemy> @Ipsenscastle This guy GETS IT
[2:26:55] <%Lordgale119> @JayEarly there's a remaster, sooo
[2:27:06] <%SirGO0SE> @Ipsenscastle saving this post
[2:27:10] <UlriktheSlayer1> what other type of vagina is there?
[2:27:35] <%Daxalog> Must be late game stuff
[2:27:36] <heartlesshealer> choices of piercings would be cool at least, if not appearance stuff down there
[2:27:37] <%Divryne> Get to mission 11 and find out.
[2:27:39] <%Lordgale119> Boss Fights are real. They're realer than they are in Ace Combat
[2:27:40] <triangularblasphemy> @UlriktheSlayer1 OUTIE
[2:27:43] <+D00msDayDan> the music gets pretty damn good
[2:27:45] <%Deano8817> I hear the plot goes places
[2:27:45] <Gorgs7> @PatStaresAt it basically is ace combat, it's just got VR
[2:27:45] <hiroy_raind> Mission 11
[2:27:50] <42nfl19> Doesn't this game also have a VR mode as well?
[2:27:52] <%CrankyVT> @PatStaresAt I'm a sucker for aerial combat games, there's no gimmick missions, gameplay's solid, and the second half goes super in (to avoid spoilers)
[2:27:53] <taro_m> it was done by 2 guys
[2:27:53] <MartialChain> look at this chonker loungin
[2:27:59] <+IntrepidEye> You've only played one and a half levels Pat. Just wait and see
[2:28:02] <%derekwst3> @UlriktheSlayer1 women downstairs do have differences
[2:28:04] <+pmtriox> its got ORANGE
[2:28:05] <Louie_Salmon> I was just thinking what boss fights would look like
[2:28:12] <triangularblasphemy> @UlriktheSlayer1 but seriously, much like the penis, the vagina comes in all shapes and sizes. Usually has to do with the lips
[2:28:13] <%Too_Much_Nukie> The gimmick missions are some of the best missions
[2:28:13] <+BigBruthaThunda> Give us all customizable genitals, or give us none!
[2:28:14] <%SirGO0SE> whats the VR like?
[2:28:20] <%promessav2> the weapon system is really nice
[2:28:24] <%CrankyVT> @PatStaresAt so there's no tunnel runs, or like that one mission in AC7 where you fly between those red circles
[2:28:32] <UlriktheSlayer1> @triangularblasphemy fair enough makes sense
[2:28:37] <%CrankyVT> Technically there are tunnel runs you can do, but they're all optional
[2:28:38] <%SirGO0SE> i have VTOL VR and the controls in VR are so realistic that its god damn impossible to play
[2:28:38] <Mr_Strut> Anything to escape the yakuza
[2:28:40] <%MostFrank> It's sky yakuza
[2:28:41] <dinnydanny777> I like the tunnel runs
[2:28:43] <+pmtriox> why
[2:28:43] <%Romuken> shame
[2:28:45] <%promessav2> there are tunnels that you could fly through
[2:28:46] <%코코꾸라> Those missions rock, bruh
[2:28:48] <%Daxalog> Can kyru fly a jet?
[2:28:51] <%Deano8817> tunnel runs are a tradition
[2:28:51] <%Divryne> Pat if you like Macross you'll like the endgame.
[2:28:52] <boxcartim> oh wow thanks twitch notes for the alert that pats live not!
[2:28:52] <%Too_Much_Nukie> lol
[2:28:56] <+Ellila> The music is kinda boppingh
[2:28:56] <+D00msDayDan> there's one mission that has some tunnels and if you fly through them it spawns a bunch of enemies
[2:28:56] <%Daoshinto> this game is so comfy to stare at.
[2:28:57] <+SFdvus> is this made by team ace?
[2:29:00] <%honeyman18> sure
[2:29:01] <%CrankyVT> Well I'm a junkie for dog-fighting, so that's just me
[2:29:06] <Profmcstevie> I guess they made sure to get the fundamentals down before they ever dipped into gimmicks, I can't fault that
[2:29:06] <triangularblasphemy> @UlriktheSlayer1 Its less about necessity and more about balance I guess? Options are value added? *shrug*
[2:29:07] <heartlesshealer> yakuza whiplash wound still too sore, so we have this today
[2:29:09] <$Dreadlord134> Wow can’t believe pat now hates yakuza that’s crazy
[2:29:12] <TangoNango> Oh god I remember LUL
[2:29:15] <+IntrepidEye> IIRC theres still missions where you dodge red icons on the map. first one is really early i think
[2:29:19] <%promessav2> some of the planes have a drift button
[2:29:20] <%Too_Much_Nukie> This feels very bare-bones.
[2:29:23] <hiroy_raind> There's also a bit more musou charm with way more enemies and way more missiles than in AC
[2:29:26] <%Jekado> yeah that yakuza 3 SUPER SPY jet
[2:29:28] <%rdark_ksu> Kiryu just throws the jet to where he wants to go
[2:29:30] <%honeyman18> the only thing I can stand to do in yakuza at the moment is golf anyway
[2:29:38] <UlriktheSlayer1> @triangularblasphemy i just wish you had different body types like fat, muscular and thin but oh well
[2:29:38] <%DiscoMatador> Totally
[2:29:39] <$zyberion626> technically yes
[2:29:40] <%fakeburg> Yup
[2:29:42] <BerryliciousDefinition> Yakuza 3 is fucking wild
[2:29:43] <%Too_Much_Nukie> Yes.
[2:29:45] <FourLeafLover> Yes, and they would be obliterated
[2:29:45] <+D00msDayDan> gun in this game has infinite range but bullet drop
[2:29:47] <%Ipsenscastle> these bullets could absolutely annihilate a dude, yes
[2:29:47] <ToneBacas> that's what i asked earlier. imagine that shit happens IRL
[2:29:48] <Brogus_Almighty> they dont magically stop existing so probably
[2:29:51] <%SirGO0SE> the BRRRR's are going along with the beat well
[2:29:52] <Mr_Strut> It's not like they disintegrate
[2:30:00] <dinnydanny777> They are probably massive as well
[2:30:01] <%AEUG_Ace_Kamille> Did someone happen with Pat and Yakuza?
[2:30:02] <%Too_Much_Nukie> @PatStaresAt Don't you remember the ambient dialogue from Mass Effect 2 about this very thing?
[2:30:05] <ChungusQuest> Every single bullet you fire hits the ground somewhere
[2:30:12] <+pmtriox> those bullets are large and fast enough they would explode someone 40,000km away
[2:30:13] <%greasypete00> if it sucks maybe jsut dont live in a warzone then
[2:30:14] <%Divryne> Pat you can yaw when you're turning so you don't have to rock back and forth.
[2:30:15] <%fakeburg> Actual death have been record from people firing their guns straight into the air
[2:30:17] <%promessav2> yup 20 mm cannon so if it hits the ground oof
[2:30:18] <boxcartim> is pat feeling well ?
[2:30:21] <%Lordgale119> @Louie_Salmon they look like really good boss fights
[2:30:21] <+Pyroclase> I'm looking at footage of Mission 11, no spoilers, and DAMN
[2:30:22] <%BinaryFireball> @Dreadlord134 I dont think he hates it I think he's tired of the grind in 7( theres a part where you have to grind a bunch)
[2:30:22] <$realm_forge> No pat the bullets keep going forever
[2:30:24] <triangularblasphemy> @UlriktheSlayer1 I'm a maniac who wants to be a flying machine squid, but I've long ago accepted that much of the devs and players don't want that option so...
[2:30:28] <+IntrepidEye> hear about that jet that shot itself down with its own bullets?
[2:30:30] <Profmcstevie> Physical material does not stop existing over distance, we are shooting SO many local wildlife right now PogChamp
[2:30:42] <heartlesshealer> @AEUG_Ace_Kamille Last yakuza stream had very strong emotional whiplash, so Pat needs a cooldown
[2:30:43] <Euchre_AFGC> I AM GOING TO SCREAM
[2:30:44] <ECRead> why did twitch just try to tell me about a fucking football game?
[2:30:48] <%SirGO0SE> anyone played this and VTOL VR? how do they compare?
[2:30:48] <%Divryne> So you can adjust your aim without having the keep rolling too far.
[2:30:48] <+pmtriox> use LB
[2:30:51] <UlriktheSlayer1> @triangularblasphemy thats a shame because that may not be kinda style either it sure does sound awesome
[2:30:57] <This_side_up_153> worse would be the missiles that miss
[2:31:00] <%promessav2> now your hgp, those explode in air
[2:31:00] <%CrankyVT> Oh yo, its the man himself in chat
[2:31:09] <%AEUG_Ace_Kamille> Ofh. That bad?
[2:31:12] <Azathotic> Holy fuck Halo Infinite isn't coming until NEXT FALL
[2:31:15] <%derekwst3> @ECRead because you need football in your life
[2:31:15] <Euchre_AFGC> HELLO EVERYONE, I'M GALAXY'S VOICE ACTOR
[2:31:16] <%Divryne> Ye much better.
[2:31:17] <ToneBacas> nice
[2:31:26] <%CrankyVT> Yo Galaxy o/
[2:31:26] <Euchre_AFGC> AND I'M ABOUT TO SCREEEEEEAM
[2:31:28] <+IntrepidEye> Hey Galaxy. I was wondering when you'd show up
[2:31:28] <%코코꾸라> Yoooooo
[2:31:35] <+guynormus69> @patstaresat DON'T get too close to the airships
[2:31:35] <ChungusQuest> hell yeah AWACS coverage
[2:31:35] <triangularblasphemy> @UlriktheSlayer1 Lost the spider bot, kept the dildos
[2:31:35] <%fakeburg> Wow sup dude
[2:31:36] <%Divryne> Too bad LUL
[2:31:36] <%Lordgale119> @Pyroclase no spoilers, but mission 15 makes me physically and emotionally uncomfortable
[2:31:41] <Euchre_AFGC> Hi again Cranky
[2:31:42] <+IntrepidEye> Saw you in Beagles chat a few days ago
[2:31:43] <%Captainahab_37> !discord
[2:31:44] <+CatastropheCorvid> Oh man, that accent.
[2:31:48] <%Captainahab_37> :(
[2:31:50] <heartlesshealer> @AEUG_Ace_Kamille The highest of highs followed by a big sad
[2:31:52] <Euchre_AFGC> o/ @IntrepidEye
[2:31:58] <%Captainahab_37> is this an Ace Combat type game
[2:32:00] <%Lordgale119> eyyy, nice. You did a good job man
[2:32:12] <%Lordgale119> big yes
[2:32:12] <Euchre_AFGC> Yes @Captainahab_37 it's directly inspired by Ace Combat
[2:32:18] <SauceJockey> he finally shows up
[2:32:30] <+guynormus69> use MGP
[2:32:32] <Euchre_AFGC> I had to wait 10 minutes to say something lmao
[2:32:34] <%AEUG_Ace_Kamille> We have AWACS coverage.
[2:32:37] <%Captainahab_37> have you guys ever had the big ace combat arcade machines that move and shit?
[2:32:37] <%greasypete00> LUL
[2:32:39] <bleugh> wingin it
[2:32:42] <DublinRage> Okay, but when does the jpeg dog show up here?
[2:32:42] <%Captainahab_37> those were cool
[2:32:47] <SauceJockey> cant wait for pat to crash into the airship again
[2:32:52] <%SirGO0SE> bogeys in chat psaCaw_SG
[2:32:54] <triangularblasphemy> And for anyone reading this long back and forth, know that Cyberpunk 2077 is probably going to be a great game post patches. Its just "what could have been" yeah?
[2:33:02] <+darksagegaming> what is this!!!
[2:33:05] <Euchre_AFGC> @DublinRage No dog, but the AWACS has a cat :V
[2:33:18] <%Captainahab_37> CDPR are pretty fast with patches iirc
[2:33:22] <Euchre_AFGC> It's Project wingman @darksagegaming
[2:33:24] <%Captainahab_37> they even released one today
[2:33:28] <%Jack_of_No_Trades> this game seems good
[2:33:28] <DublinRage> @euchre_afgc SeemsGood
[2:33:30] <akitanito> just flak its shit up
[2:33:37] <%Odetokale> happy 9 months to my favorite ginger orb!
[2:33:40] <triangularblasphemy> Because of the news, I actually bought this game instead of Cyberpunk tomorrow
[2:33:44] <+darksagegaming> I'd
[2:33:50] <Euchre_AFGC> o/ @DublinRage
[2:33:51] <triangularblasphemy> This game is very very good
[2:33:56] <akitanito> pat committing war crimes
[2:33:56] <%promessav2> so one sorta big difference with the ships (airships too) you need to kill every target on them to take them down
[2:33:56] <Profmcstevie> Cyberpunk is gonna eat up ALL that base storage on next gen with those patches lsrSpicy
[2:34:01] <+darksagegaming> is cyberpunk out yet?
[2:34:05] <+Pyroclase> That IS nice
[2:34:06] <+tigerfang86> waow
[2:34:06] <%Divryne> LUL
[2:34:06] <triangularblasphemy> THE MAN SPEAKS TRUTH
[2:34:08] <%greasypete00> LUL
[2:34:08] <+Wuzzin> anyone remember the name of the game where you're investigating inside actual and perceived memories
[2:34:08] <+tigerfang86> so cool!
[2:34:10] <%BoxNavy> nice
[2:34:11] <+seoliart> Cyberpunk LUL
[2:34:11] <+Draegen86> HEYO hot take
[2:34:11] <%Jack_of_No_Trades> what a great feature!
[2:34:11] <%Too_Much_Nukie> lol
[2:34:12] <kenny_biff> like cyberpunk? LUL
[2:34:12] <triangularblasphemy> @darksagegaming tomorrow for some of us
[2:34:13] <%TheNewJapanGuy> Right?
[2:34:15] <Louie_Salmon> That always a great feature for a game to have
[2:34:18] <ToneBacas> epilepsy warnings have existed in games for fuck knows since when
[2:34:18] <BerryliciousDefinition> LUL
[2:34:19] <This_side_up_153> Last cyperpunk gameplay I saw it looked kinda like deus ex
[2:34:19] <TheChapyGuy> what a thoughtful game
[2:34:22] <%greasypete00> it looks really fun
[2:34:23] <+D00msDayDan> the final boss might though
[2:34:24] <%BoxNavy> no
[2:34:25] <+JackalKing> Not causing you to suffer from an epileptic seizure SO FAR
[2:34:27] <+darksagegaming> no pat
[2:34:28] <heartlesshealer> @triangularblasphemy post patches should be good, yeah. Just kinda sucks a lot when all the bad parts are drawn out over a long time of knowing and one of them is a medical thing in addition
[2:34:29] <%YakumoYomi> 46gb day one patches. This is the world we live in.
[2:34:29] <+tigerfang86> wait
[2:34:32] <+Catpurnicus> Epilepsy mode is CDPR's hard mode
[2:34:32] <FourLeafLover> yea all the time
[2:34:32] <+IntrepidEye> Pat no
[2:34:34] <%VashyronM> no?
[2:34:35] <+tigerfang86> HOW DOES IT BOTH HAPPEN AT ONCE
[2:34:35] <UlriktheSlayer1> yeah but this can still cause motion sickness
[2:34:36] <JetpackMcQuack> no
[2:34:37] <%AzureGale> That has never happened to me
[2:34:38] <%WritebroAlpha> Yo, just tuned back in, how's this game?
[2:34:38] <%Xelhesia> LOL
[2:34:40] <Kain5707> im sorry?
[2:34:41] <akitanito> @Wuzzin signifier
[2:34:41] <%Ipsenscastle> remember when basically every game caused epileptic seizures
[2:34:42] <chaumiester> So..... you?
[2:34:43] <$zyberion626> no?
[2:34:45] <+tigerfang86> HOW DOES BOTH OF IT GET ON YOU AT ONCE
[2:34:45] <%Dementedpenguin> Fuck
[2:34:46] <ToneBacas> i'm confus
[2:34:47] <SilverFaustX> lol
[2:34:47] <%Saphy115> what
[2:34:48] <$Raikouija> LUL
[2:34:49] <+guynormus69> you'll notice the airships don't have regular engines, they're powered by the same shit that messed up the plate tectonics and volcanoes
[2:34:51] <Profmcstevie> This low bar is going undernearth the earth, like damn bro
[2:34:55] <Palmtuna> Can someone catch me up on the cyber punk news?
[2:34:57] <heartlesshealer> Remember Porygon?
[2:34:59] <+Draegen86> @tigerfang86 look up fecal vomiting.. or don't.
[2:35:00] <dinnydanny777> I'm sure the game will make up for it somehow :)
[2:35:01] <%BinaryFireball> wait how bad is it?????
[2:35:02] <Euchre_AFGC> oh god is Cyberpunk giving people seizures?
[2:35:05] <%Too_Much_Nukie> It's not the first game.
[2:35:10] <ToneBacas> again, games have epilepsy warnings pretty much as a standard
[2:35:10] <SilverFaustX> it murders u, and then barfs on u
[2:35:13] <%BoxNavy> disney cdpr and pikachu are ALL trying to KILL you
[2:35:14] <+tigerfang86> I dont think I'm gonna do that @Draegen86
[2:35:17] <%BinaryFireball> is this not like one club level or something??
[2:35:18] <%greasypete00> CDPR did put out a thing saying theyre gonna work on it asap, for what its worth
[2:35:18] <+tigerfang86> lol
[2:35:19] <Kain5707> os the game a dumpster fire?
[2:35:21] <%Too_Much_Nukie> @Euchre_AFGC Too many neon signs yeah
[2:35:23] <%Pappajimbo> I looked up fighter guns. the f-14 used 20mm HE rounds so anything on the ground is getting ripped apart
[2:35:25] <UlriktheSlayer1> i think it makes sense itd be cyberpunk
[2:35:26] <Euchre_AFGC> ANOTHER REASON FOR PROJECT WINGMAN TO OUTSELL CYBERPUNK
[2:35:31] <+IntrepidEye> Is that why you have brain rot now?
[2:35:31] <@Pandora_Prime> That episode never aired outside Japan
[2:35:32] <+Draegen86> @tigerfang86 good call XD
[2:35:33] <Euchre_AFGC> YES, GIVE ME MORE POWER
[2:35:34] <%Too_Much_Nukie> @Kain5707 No but it's dangerous
[2:35:35] <+Wuzzin> @akitanito ty
[2:35:36] <%Dementedpenguin> @Palmtuna game might induce seizures for players
[2:35:38] <Euchre_AFGC> GALAXY WILL TAKE OVER THE PLANET
[2:35:42] <triangularblasphemy> @heartlesshealer The game will be what it is, no concerns. The worst part is the people locking arms around the game and shitting on any review lower than 85, or even defending the siezures
[2:35:42] <%Ipsenscastle> remember when the Incredibles 2 had all that goddamn flashing light shit when they absolutely should've known better?
[2:35:47] <heartlesshealer> @Euchre_AFGC they have a recreation of the head-mounted device that is medically designed to induce seizures in the game
[2:35:51] <%Divryne> You did it you saved Cascadia.
[2:35:51] <Palmtuna> I hate it when that happens, thanks Demented!
[2:35:52] <SauceJockey> galaxy be power trippin
[2:35:53] <%AEUG_Ace_Kamille> Wingman won't kill you, good to know.
[2:35:54] <$Raikouija> Poor Porygon, he did nothing wrong, he was framed by Pikachu!
[2:35:56] <%promessav2> when it came out it outsold red dead online, but sadly not cybor pank
[2:35:59] <triangularblasphemy> @heartlesshealer You got your good game, just... cmon PLEASE
[2:36:00] <ChungusQuest> @Euchre_AFGC there is a segment that is reported to have distinct similarity to a labratory test literally designed to induce seizure
[2:36:00] <+akumakins> So you're saying that epileptic fits are a failure of game design
[2:36:01] <chaumiester> Are.... you sure it's not just "Game Journalist" stirring up shit.... for the sake of stirring up shit?
[2:36:02] <%drdemenz> Next bit
[2:36:02] <$zyberion626> I mean they said they're slapping a warning and are going to focus on fixing that ASAP, so I can't really complain
[2:36:04] <Euchre_AFGC> OH GOD WHO THOUGHT THAT WOULD BE A GOOD IDEA
[2:36:07] <%Too_Much_Nukie> Incredibles 2 was bad enough that it gave me a migraine.
[2:36:08] <%WritebroAlpha> @Palmtuna one entire subsystem in the game uses what appears to be a render of a medical device used to deliberately trigger seizures; a journalist with epiliepsy had a seizure
[2:36:08] <+Pyroclase> oh man, Halo Infinite got delayed AGAIN
[2:36:10] <%Captainahab_37> it's funny people think 2077 will be like GTA
[2:36:10] <Kain5707> @Too_Much_Nukie i heard about the seizure nonsense and i really hope that gets fixed for people who suffer from FeelsBadMan
[2:36:11] <JetpackMcQuack> my planet needs me
[2:36:13] <+Jokobeast> @Palmtuna There's a section of the game that uses light effects that are very similar to medical devices used to induce seizures.
[2:36:20] <%Captainahab_37> 2077 is like VTMB and Deus Ex
[2:36:24] <%Captainahab_37> looks like*
[2:36:30] <Kain5707> bugsnax?
[2:36:31] <Palmtuna> woof
[2:36:33] <%BoxNavy> oh no....
[2:36:34] <%CrankyVT> Time to see if Pat can land the plane good
[2:36:37] <%Ipsenscastle> that's a bad sound bite and I don't like it
[2:36:39] <BubbaGAN0USH> here we go
[2:36:40] <ToneBacas> @Captainahab_37 VTMB? what's that?
[2:36:44] <%Odetokale> Odetokale subscribed at Tier 1. They've subscribed for 9 months! happy 9 months to my favorite ginger orb!
[2:36:44] <triangularblasphemy> these are crazy easy in this game
[2:36:45] <%Jekado> TOP GUN LANDING TIME
[2:36:45] <+Catpurnicus> lol of course
[2:36:46] <Lanka14> oh god please dont fail
[2:36:47] <ChungusQuest> he's pooping internally
[2:36:48] <%WritebroAlpha> Furthermore, people then sent the journalist what they claimed were supportive emails but instead were epilepsy traps with strobing videos, and she had a second seizure.
[2:36:48] <%CrankyVT> You get no guidance
[2:36:51] <+Catpurnicus> the true final boss: landing
[2:36:51] <Profmcstevie> You know whats super dumb about a lot of epileptic fit stuff? It's also a pain to look at for those WITHOUT epilepsy
[2:36:52] <heartlesshealer> @triangularblasphemy Yeah, I get what you mean. Bad faith fans are almost always worse than the media content itself
[2:36:52] <%Too_Much_Nukie> @Kain5707 To be fair to Cyberpunk, IT DOES GIVE A WARNING
[2:36:52] <triangularblasphemy> just slow and touch, pat
[2:36:53] <akitanito> On a rating of AC0-7, how corny are the lines?
[2:36:54] <%Captainahab_37> vampire the masquerade bloodlines @tonebacas
[2:36:55] <triangularblasphemy> Slow and touch
[2:36:58] <%Divryne> Nah cause it's in the jungle with a dirt road.
[2:37:00] <%BoxNavy> DansGame
[2:37:02] <+guynormus69> @patstaresat you need to BIG slowdown or you will roll to your death
[2:37:02] <+tigerfang86> BUTTPOOP AIR
[2:37:02] <+Catpurnicus> who else played wing commander 1
[2:37:03] <%SirGO0SE> do landing, play volleyball
[2:37:06] <%Pappajimbo> anti-AA farts
[2:37:07] <%NovaKnightmare> you mean FARTS???
[2:37:08] <%promessav2> they went for a zero
[2:37:09] <Profmcstevie> DOG IS A BAD WINGMAN
[2:37:10] <ToneBacas> @Captainahab_37 oh neat i wanna play that sometime
[2:37:11] <%BoxNavy> OH NOOOO
[2:37:12] <Arrowpoison1> Yoooo Landing sequence too? GOTY
[2:37:13] <FlashFrame> Zengief farts.
[2:37:13] <%Dementedpenguin> I loved landing in Ace Combat games.
[2:37:16] <%MyNameIsRasus> this is gonna be that madagascar 2 scene
[2:37:17] <%Too_Much_Nukie> The journalists didn't read the warning, but it's already there. And CDPR has said they will add a second less-skippable warning to the game.
[2:37:17] <triangularblasphemy> DONT STALL
[2:37:18] <%MyNameIsRasus> i can feel it
[2:37:20] <+akumakins> Gently kiss the ground
[2:37:23] <triangularblasphemy> there she is
[2:37:24] <Lanka14> thank god
[2:37:25] <triangularblasphemy> good
[2:37:25] <BubbaGAN0USH> nailed it
[2:37:27] <%SirGO0SE> PogChamp
[2:37:29] <%Too_Much_Nukie> I mean most games have an epilepsy warning.
[2:37:30] <%Captainahab_37> @tonebacas if you do get the mods that fix the broken ass game
[2:37:30] <%fakeburg> Yeah Pat
[2:37:30] <JetpackMcQuack> good enough
[2:37:30] <%Divryne> GAG
[2:37:32] <bettysharkface> Not bad
[2:37:32] <%KineKithZen> Great now taxi a mile to the gas
[2:37:32] <%MyNameIsRasus> good
[2:37:33] <%CrankyVT> you did it
[2:37:36] <%Deft_Thought> Clean
[2:37:36] <%Captainahab_37> cuz it's a broken ass game, vtmb
[2:37:37] <%Ipsenscastle> if you fuck up the landing do you have to restart the mission?
[2:37:37] <%WritebroAlpha> good landing
[2:37:38] <%adzy2k6> WoW, that was a really short landing roll XD
[2:37:39] <$zyberion626> could you imagine an airforce pilot grunting softly as he lands?
[2:37:39] <Profmcstevie> Didn't die PogChamp
[2:37:39] <+BigBruthaThunda> Kreygasm
[2:37:39] <+IntrepidEye> was that Paige burping for gagging
[2:37:39] <%asgard147> limesPoggers
[2:37:41] <Lanka14> Pat if you failed the landing you would have had to replay the entire mission.
[2:37:42] <Euchre_AFGC> Galaxy approves of your optimal landing
[2:37:42] <%코코꾸라> @Too_Much_Nukie Bruh, it's hidden in the EULA
[2:37:42] <+akumakins> Wow, you landed in like 50 yards
[2:37:43] <SauceJockey> @PatStaresAt just an FYI AWACS Galaxy's VA @Euchre_AFGC is present in the chat
[2:37:47] <%코코꾸라> There's nothing in-game

[2:38:38] <%WritebroAlpha> I want to remind chat that the epilepsy scene in 2077 uses what appears to be a medical device specifically designed to deliberately cause seizures.

[2:39:55] <%fakeburg> psaDogchamp > psaJpeg
[2:39:58] <%AncelDeLambert> y'know, most mercenaries do their best NOT to see combat
[2:40:00] <JetpackMcQuack> hitman and circus LUL
[2:40:03] <%Captainahab_37> does this game have a dog jpeg?
[2:40:04] <%Lordgale119> like, they actually did nothing wrong
[2:40:05] <%Captainahab_37> it should
[2:40:10] <%Pappajimbo> dog of war does not care. gibs money
[2:40:11] <ShichiNoBushi> Which one do I shoot!?
[2:40:13] <+tigerfang86> No pat, the FUEL
[2:40:17] <CrimsonCore90> @tonebacas He ded
[2:40:19] <%MyNameIsRasus> What's this world called? NormalFalse? Kappa
[2:40:21] <triangularblasphemy> Especially the Star Trek Federation! Those guys are the worst! They sold weapons to the BORG
[2:40:29] <%Divryne> But do you wanna live in poverty Pat?
[2:40:31] <SauceJockey> @MyNameIsRasus world on fire IIRC
[2:40:31] <CrimsonCore90> It's why he was in the game
[2:40:35] <ChungusQuest> chill out, Sundowner
[2:40:42] <%BoxNavy> pat are you ok
[2:40:42] <+talon84> "So is that a stupid name?"
[2:40:42] <%promessav2> arrow avro time
[2:40:47] <Euchre_AFGC> @MyNameIsRasus World On Fire I think is what they call it
[2:40:49] <%promessav2> ok not yet
[2:40:56] <%MyNameIsRasus> @SauceJockey Ok that's super fucking dope tho
[2:40:56] <heartlesshealer> blue plane is blue
[2:40:59] <%Captainahab_37> I like these games but I fucking suck at them
[2:41:00] <MagmaRam> F-4 best because it has Prez
[2:41:00] <triangularblasphemy> Can't go wrong with a plane from the 60s
[2:41:01] <%promessav2> go ahead and save for arrow avro
[2:41:19] <%Divryne> UBGL.
[2:41:20] <%promessav2> i like L
[2:41:23] <+guynormus69> don't bother with UGBs, keep the gunpods
[2:41:26] <NavigatorBR> Okay, was away for like 10 minutes, what happened, did Pat crash again?
[2:41:32] <%Captainahab_37> pick a fast one that go NYOOOM
[2:41:34] <%Divryne> The radius is way bigger.
[2:41:37] <triangularblasphemy> Rockets are best
[2:41:37] <%promessav2> easier to hit
[2:41:38] <%CrankyVT> UGBS has more mileage due to ammo count, but I typically stuck to MLAGs when I could
[2:41:41] <triangularblasphemy> but no option there
[2:41:41] <hiroy_raind> UGB kinda suck here
[2:41:45] <%MyNameIsRasus> @NavigatorBR missed his balls out on stream
[2:41:50] <MagmaRam> SAA/HGP/MLAA is the best
[2:41:51] <CrimsonCore90> Pull the trigger
[2:41:51] <%SirGO0SE> f for gunpogs
[2:41:54] <Profmcstevie> I love, as someone who knows nothing, seeing chat being filled with weapon jargon lsrToxic
[2:41:56] <akitanito> you still have default gun
[2:41:56] <%Captainahab_37> ultra epic fast
[2:41:58] <%MyNameIsRasus> man jets are cool
[2:41:59] <Euchre_AFGC> @CrankyVT did you finish the game yet? I think last time I saw you, you left off on 11?
[2:42:00] <%AEUG_Ace_Kamille> F
[2:42:05] <%greasypete00> skrr
[2:42:14] <%Divryne> Lol you fucking trashed your plane IRL. LUL
[2:42:20] <%CrankyVT> @Euchre_AFGC Yup! Beat it twice, both pre and post patch on Hard mode
[2:42:21] <Riettler> UGBL big number, UGB3 do combo
[2:42:22] <%zeraux_> how does stack up against ace combat?
[2:42:22] <ChungusQuest> Acronyms are cool and everyone should use them for everything always
[2:42:26] <%BoxNavy> look how big you did it
[2:42:32] <%Divryne> PROBABLY.
[2:42:33] <tanarath> I can't wait for Pat to fail, then have to install gunpods again & magically succeed.
[2:42:37] <%Engwithan_Elder_God> Tail strike.
[2:42:42] <%CrankyVT> @Euchre_AFGC I played through it a second time live to show everyone who watched beforehand
[2:42:48] <triangularblasphemy> Its a radio tower
[2:42:52] <%Divryne> Don't worry about it.
[2:42:52] <triangularblasphemy> we use them to talk far
[2:42:53] <FourLeafLover> 5G tower
[2:42:55] <%Dementedpenguin> Fucking Orbital Elevator over here
[2:42:58] <%Dementedpenguin> LUL
[2:42:58] <%SirGO0SE> @Profmcstevie you gotta put da ninety cal on the magazine with the air to air seeking right trigger duh
[2:42:59] <+Pyroclase> looks like a radio tower
[2:43:05] <%promessav2> don't worry about it
[2:43:08] <taro_m> 5G tower
[2:43:10] <%Ipsenscastle> it's no space elevator, I'll tell you that much
[2:43:21] <%derekwst3> the monoliths are appearing in games too
[2:43:23] <%AncelDeLambert> Rowsy rowsy Rowsdower, howsy howsy howsdower, shalsy shalsy shal- Rowsdower?
[2:43:28] <%AncelDeLambert> Rowsdower?
[2:43:28] <ChungusQuest> maybe it's just a very poorly-funded space elevator?
[2:43:31] <+guynormus69> it's really just personal preference, with large UGB you have less, and small ugb is too small unless you go in close
[2:43:33] <Profmcstevie> @SirGO0SE please sir I didn't study for this test lsrNoDude
[2:43:43] <%CrankyVT> I really dig the atmosphere of this mission with the red lighting
[2:43:54] <%AncelDeLambert> YOU WILL BE THE LAST SACRIFICE, ZAP ROWSDOWER
[2:43:58] <MagmaRam> all the lighting in this game is so pretty
[2:43:58] <42nfl19> Are we a silent protagonist again?
[2:44:02] <triangularblasphemy> @CrankyVT Ace Combat is blue, Project Wingman is RED
[2:44:19] <%BinaryFireball> cyberpunk devs not super smart... just saw what causes the seizures and it's like duh no shit that's gonna cause problems
[2:44:20] <%Divryne> The boat boat.
[2:44:21] <%BoxNavy> boat boat boat
[2:44:21] <%Lordgale119> @42nfl19 canonically he's "in the zone"
[2:44:21] <redrins> boat
[2:44:21] <Kain5707> boat boat
[2:44:22] <%CrankyVT> I know that all too well triangular lmao, its the best
[2:44:23] <triangularblasphemy> @CrankyVT I'm excited for their fight on the temenigru
[2:44:23] <%Divryne> Not the AA boat.
[2:44:23] <akitanito> no
[2:44:23] <%SirGO0SE> @Profmcstevie but youre the professor! whos flying this-
[2:44:28] <%AncelDeLambert> sure thing, Pat, boat
[2:44:29] <tattleworm> you appear to be saying boat
[2:44:33] <$zyberion626> hundreds dead
[2:44:35] <%AncelDeLambert> epic boat, brah
[2:44:37] <ChungusQuest> It's so boat it's ship
[2:44:37] <+guynormus69> @42nfl19 yes, but the WSO can talk if you fly 2 seater planes
[2:44:38] <akitanito> !scratched!
[2:44:40] <Giztech> use this tic tacks to give them a minty fresh explosion
[2:45:02] <taro_m> In this game your friends can actually do shit
[2:45:04] <triangularblasphemy> @CrankyVT Apologies for calling the obvious!
[2:45:23] <Kain5707> do a barrel roll!
[2:45:24] <%Divryne> Pat you have unlimited flares.
[2:45:26] <42nfl19> Does this game have co-op?
[2:45:31] <akitanito> what difficulty is pat playing at?
[2:45:32] <Profmcstevie> Something about that *tink* of getting shit sounds super petty LUL
[2:45:36] <%AncelDeLambert> this triangle appears to be WARNING me, somehow
[2:45:45] <+Jokobeast> @42nfl19 Sadly not.
[2:45:45] <%CrankyVT> He's playing on Normal
[2:45:51] <a_mad_dragon> I can fly twice as high SingsNote
[2:45:55] <+guynormus69> singleplayer only unfortunately, but there's a rogue like mode too
[2:46:01] <%SirGO0SE> soothing safe sky. fly into its soft never ending embrace
[2:46:17] <MagmaRam> conquest mode is hard, man.
[2:46:31] <%AEUG_Ace_Kamille> @crankyvt you ever play Sky Rogue to scratch the dogfight itch?
[2:46:35] <Kain5707> rouge like fightr jet game thats neat
[2:46:36] <taro_m> Its good thing there is no MP as MP forces bullshit balancing. I prefer SP and modding potential
[2:46:47] <%lilytastic> it pink
[2:46:53] <%CrankyVT> @AEUG_Ace_Kamille I never got the chance to. It solid?
[2:47:02] <@Pandora_Prime> "WTF enemies shouldn't be allowed to shoot back!"
[2:47:06] <triangularblasphemy> Now our super planes have a reason to exist
[2:47:07] <%AncelDeLambert> the only thing I would ever want a 3080 for would be to grab this, grab a VR set, and a joystick and REALLY fly
[2:47:14] <%vaporousTippler> Sky Rogue is fun. And super moddable. I flew with Starfox ships if I remember right.
[2:47:14] <%SirGO0SE> man i remember getting Crimson Skies on the OG Xbox the day Xbox Live came out I'm fucking OLD
[2:47:24] <%SirGO0SE> and it ran fucking AWESOME
[2:47:47] <triangularblasphemy> They're paratroopers, its in the name sir
[2:47:57] <Finakala> This OST is kinda bop ngl
[2:47:58] <+guynormus69> take out the planes before they take off
[2:48:03] <FourLeafLover> ground boats
[2:48:06] <Profmcstevie> This red lighting is doing it for me, is that a altitude thing?
[2:48:07] <+guynormus69> makes it easier
[2:48:11] <%AncelDeLambert> "They're jumping in, in their, their little boats"
[2:48:11] <+Jokobeast> And one of them probably got blasted by your jetwash. LUL
[2:48:13] <NavigatorBR> Okay the Paratroopers are neat.
[2:48:15] <%Engwithan_Elder_God> Danger close there.
[2:48:21] <%AEUG_Ace_Kamille> @crankyvt Yeah, it's even more arcade but it's solid. Moddable too. I had Morgan, Zeta, and some VFs in my hangar.
[2:48:25] <seaechiowai> fk em up!
[2:48:29] <akitanito> just use the bombs on the planes
[2:48:30] <+Vestillion> Just drop fire on the paratroopers landing spots, it's not a big dea
[2:48:31] <%Divryne> Kill the bad planes.
[2:48:31] <+Vestillion> deal
[2:48:35] <%promessav2> you can use bombs on runway targets too
[2:48:52] <MagmaRam> Bombing the runway you plan to land on sounds like a good idea.
[2:49:09] <%SirGO0SE> plane did peepoo in the house again :(
[2:49:10] <triangularblasphemy> I think they can't suppress the paratroopers do to the overwhelmingly powerful air support
[2:49:14] <+Jokobeast> Landing gear handles potholes fine, right? :D
[2:49:17] <%Divryne> THEY'RE TOUGH.
[2:49:27] <akitanito> rubber bombs
[2:49:29] <MagmaRam> They took it in a non-critical area
[2:49:32] <TotallyNotPolo> crash into the ground right now pat no balls
[2:49:36] <AncelDeLambert> where ARE these AA vehicles coming from?
[2:49:39] <triangularblasphemy> Runway covered in burning wreckage
[2:49:44] <triangularblasphemy> pitted by bomb and missile blasts
[2:49:47] <%fakeburg> Their anti asphalt bombs, they don't hurt the tar
[2:50:04] <triangularblasphemy> Oh wow, I didn't think those made it to production
[2:50:08] <%AncelDeLambert> kablamzo
[2:50:08] <triangularblasphemy> The gundams of bombs
[2:50:17] <%promessav2> the game has a lot of named pilots to kill
[2:50:20] <%SirGO0SE> the color schemes are really playing to what this game does well
[2:50:30] <%SirGO0SE> the particles and FX are genuinely better than AC7
[2:50:39] <%SirGO0SE> and the different shades each level highlights that well
[2:50:41] <%SirGO0SE> nice touch
[2:50:47] <Second_Omega> I love that the late game planes let you take 10+ mlaam’s at once
[2:50:52] <%Too_Much_Nukie> You are high.
[2:50:55] <+guynormus69> some named pilots/squadrons are named after Kickstarter backers, there's a ton in conquest mode
[2:51:01] <Captain_Doomsday> Soo-EE
[2:51:02] <%BoxNavy> yes monkaS
[2:51:02] <%promessav2> it's cool because different difficulties add more ace polits
[2:51:02] <akitanito> yes
[2:51:04] <Kain5707> vineHog
[2:51:06] <BerryliciousDefinition> Yeah this environment looks really cool
[2:51:08] <Second_Omega> So you can just itano circus a dude
[2:51:09] <%Ipsenscastle> you did indeed squeal like an actual pig
[2:51:09] <%AncelDeLambert> You and Paige ARE made for each other!
[2:51:12] <Explodincatz> tomorrow u will
[2:51:15] <%Jaller101514> piggy pat
[2:51:16] <%AncelDeLambert> You squeal, and she oinks!
[2:51:17] <%SaiyanShoto> What the fuck was that?
[2:51:17] <%rdark_ksu> When Pigs fly right?
[2:51:21] <%BoxNavy> youre becoming a bdsm dude in a yakuza game
[2:51:28] <seaechiowai> squeal all you desire
[2:51:38] <akitanito> One thing I didn't really like in 7 was how hard it was to read the HUD sometimes
[2:51:44] <%SirGO0SE> even though the ac7 lightning missions still probably look the GOAT
[2:51:57] <ghoostyberry> is this ssss gridman
[2:52:01] <%SirGO0SE> yeah that was the case in the storm missions too @akitanito
[2:52:05] <%promessav2> they let you change the hud color in this so that's nice
[2:52:09] <$Raikouija> I love the indie scene, you never know what you’ll get and eventually if the original creators don’t make a mainline game of a beloved series, someone will do it for you
[2:52:11] <thelonechris> Did JPEG Dog show up?
[2:52:22] <%Lordgale119> I dunno, this game's got some REALLY intense lightning
[2:52:26] <ghoostyberry> dog
[2:52:26] <%SirGO0SE> the angled hud and moving map are nice too
[2:52:26] <%CrankyVT> Yeah, your allies actually do work in this
[2:52:28] <MasterCosmic> Looks more maneuverable
[2:52:28] <triangularblasphemy> You might die
[2:52:33] <akitanito> don't fumble
[2:52:43] <+mechslayer71> Who made this game? And what’s he playing on? PC?
[2:52:44] <%Ipsenscastle> okay the repeating ocean texture doesn't look too hot
[2:52:48] <wasdknife> dizzy
[2:52:52] <$Raikouija> Don’t fuck up pat
[2:52:53] <SauceJockey> i was hoping he'd crash into the burning wreckage

[2:54:06] <ChungusQuest> @Euchre_AFGC do you ever do stuff like toss some trash from a distance and find yourself saying "ground target eliminated"?
[2:54:08] <%Agami23> i really wish there was a ace combat fantasy game. like flying jets and shit to fight dragons
[2:54:18] <%rumtumtugnutz> So it’s not Ace Combat. It’s STARFOX
[2:54:21] <Euchre_AFGC> @ChungusQuest no lmao
[2:54:23] <%promessav2> we definetly stan ace combat 0 in this house
[2:54:23] <%AEUG_Ace_Kamille> "Crosstalk, this will be your final lesson."
[2:54:27] <$Raikouija> @agami23 Drakengard Kappa
[2:54:34] <Euchre_AFGC> @rumtumtugnutz Ace Combat has boss fights too tho
[2:54:40] <triangularblasphemy> "My plane... is my body"
[2:54:41] <%Lordgale119> @Agami23 that's literally what drakengard was meant to be
[2:54:46] <triangularblasphemy> "OVER G, OVER G, OVER G"
[2:54:54] <%Ipsenscastle> @Agami23 There was a terrible one back in the day!
[2:54:56] <huskarl_zap> i am the bone of my plane
[2:55:01] <%Agami23> @Raikouija fine, i wish there was a GOOD game that was ace combat but fantasy
[2:55:03] <%Ipsenscastle> A licensed Reign of Fire game
[2:55:17] <%Lordgale119> [Spoilers] is a more hardcore boss than Mihaly imo
[2:55:17] <Euchre_AFGC> yeah
[2:55:21] <Euchre_AFGC> THESE guys arent so tough
[2:55:24] <Euchre_AFGC> ahahaha

[2:55:26] <%Agami23> i basically just want a game of that anime GATE
[2:55:32] <%Lordgale119> hue
[2:55:33] <Euchre_AFGC> Crosstalk is easy mode
[2:55:34] <%AEUG_Ace_Kamille> <<This weapon alone will not be enough to defeat Three Strikes>>
[2:55:42] <BlackOrchidKI> This is just Star Wolf.
[2:55:43] <ChungusQuest> The first encounter with Star Wolf wasn't so bad, either
[2:55:43] <%Agami23> except without the last few episodes
[2:55:46] <%Divryne> I see Pat is mastering the power of GUN.
[2:55:48] <%promessav2> @Agami23 do you mean like draken j35 but actually a dragon
[2:55:49] <%Ipsenscastle> these explosions are so fucking satisfying
[2:55:50] <Second_Omega> Yeah spoilers is raw. Pre patch was a nightmare
[2:55:51] <$Dew217> I would love to see Pat stream a jet fighter game in a full axis simulation machine.
[2:55:56] <%zeraux_> but i dont wanna hurt dragons dragons are cool. those wyverns can go eat shit tho
[2:56:01] <%Lordgale119> @Agami23 but without the nationalist japanese propaganda right
[2:56:12] <afronooch> <<This Twisted game needs to be reset!>>
[2:56:23] <triangularblasphemy> I'll admit, I <spoilered> <spoiler> during the <spoiler> mission they appear, and that shit was pretty <spoiler>
[2:56:26] <%promessav2> what has bBorder given us?
[2:56:34] <MagmaRam> Books?
[2:56:38] <%adzy2k6> Do the allied fighters actually do much in this?
[2:56:39] <triangularblasphemy> Basically I could only use guns
[2:56:41] <%Agami23> @Lordgale119 no the nationalist japanese propaganda i was fine with. it was the pedo shit that made me drop it.
[2:56:41] <%promessav2> what has Borders given us? *

[2:58:52] <Euchre_AFGC> @Grunkle_Dan_ ?????????????????? the game is beautiful
[2:58:55] <heartlesshealer> I would say "in addition to" instead of "instead of" Ace Combat
[2:59:02] <+IntrepidEye> Didn't know Rimmy played it too
[2:59:05] <wasdknife> so is this just armoured core with jetts?
[2:59:05] <%CalderGaming> @Second_Omega I only have so much time in my week lol
[2:59:07] <%Too_Much_Nukie> @Grunkle_Dan_ Thank you! I felt like I was taking crazy pills with people saying the particle effects are better than AC7
[2:59:10] <%StrawberryPantsu> THIS IS JUST ACE COMBAT
[2:59:12] <+guynormus69> @grunkle_dan_ it's made by a 2 man team
[2:59:17] <%Too_Much_Nukie> This game shows its budget
[2:59:21] <%MyNameIsRasus> Cascadia is just quebec

[2:59:40] <%kyh9> Happy we've got Indie AC-likes now
[2:59:41] <%AEUG_Ace_Kamille> Ace Combat doesn't have a cramped genre, you can play both.
[2:59:45] <triangularblasphemy> The game's art direction is fantastic, but you can feel the budget
[2:59:45] <%BinaryFireball> to be truthful I hate your face and all that you stand for
[2:59:55] <Euchre_AFGC> @kyh9 it is basically an Ace Combat game yea
[2:59:56] <%Ipsenscastle> It's punching well above its weight given the size of the team
[2:59:57] <triangularblasphemy> Thats more praise for the devs really, they busted their ass and it shows
[2:59:57] <%promessav2> that comes up later
[2:59:58] <$Raikouija> This is just ace combat without character models! It’s so good!
[2:59:59] <%Jack_of_No_Trades> oh is that ProZD?

[3:06:07] <%KeiganOfAstora> They couldn't give him sunglasses lol
[3:06:08] <triangularblasphemy> This is surreal
[3:06:08] <%s1rcuit> he's got dead eyes
[3:06:11] <%adzy2k6> Haven't these things been around for a while?
[3:06:12] <%SirGO0SE> Brailliant +2
[3:06:16] <%doc_ock_rokc> @PatStaresAt why does it have writing on it
[3:06:17] <%Zeif00> Brailliant
[3:06:17] <%Dementedpenguin> This actually looks pretty sick
[3:06:22] <+chiazam> Wait I just got back, what in the world are we watching?
[3:06:30] <$payatanharkonnen> These are tits in Braille
[3:06:38] <+TheBitingIrish> The dots, Pat
[3:06:39] <%KineKithZen> I bet those aren't even mechanical keyswitches Kappa
[3:06:45] <%SirGO0SE> play cyber punk in braille you coward
[3:06:46] <%Ynkubus_> magic
[3:06:46] <%maskofmichael> magic
[3:06:48] <%adzy2k6> @PatStaresAt There are 8 dots per letter, and 8 keys
[3:06:50] <KingVantq> magic
[3:06:51] <+TheBitingIrish> The dots
[3:06:52] <%Lordgale119> each button is a dot
[3:06:53] <%doc_ock_rokc> @PatStaresAt We have had Braille keyboard's since the 1900s
[3:06:54] <DeepSeaMastodon> Have you never watched sneakers?
[3:06:55] <%TIME_PUNCHER> oh it's like a stenographer keyboard @patstaresat
[3:06:55] <%Agami23> combination of keys to make the different dots
[3:06:56] <@SoFarFetched> I beleive those buttons represents the dots
[3:06:58] <triangularblasphemy> This feels like magic
[3:06:58] <%promessav2> i guess they use brail patterns
[3:06:59] <+vansliger> magic
[3:07:00] <susukouhai> ur not blind so u wont get it
[3:07:01] <%Engwithan_Elder_God> Reads the mind.
[3:07:01] <%Lordgale119> you form ltters one dot at a time
[3:07:01] <%KeiganOfAstora> Keep watching I guess?
[3:07:02] <%Ynkubus_> A wizard did it
[3:07:03] <%AncelDeLambert> @PatStaresAt it uses a chord input, you press multiple fingers for each character, instead of one key
[3:07:04] <%ssjklyco> So is this video for blind people? How are they going to see this video?
[3:07:04] <%Zeif00> dots Pat
[3:07:07] <%KineKithZen> This is like watching someone summon a Primal
[3:07:08] <@SoFarFetched> so certain button combinations do the letters
[3:07:11] <+reallybigrocks> I love this dude obviously reading off a screen and they still have to cut constantly to cover his mistakes
[3:07:12] <%Ipsenscastle> each key corresponds to a dot in the braille characters
[3:07:12] <%Xelhesia> THIS IS GENIUINELY FASCINATING
[3:07:14] <spicystarbursts> Jesus this reminds me of the special typing machines that court reporters use. It's absolutely nuts
[3:07:14] <%KeiganOfAstora> Braillient, as in brilliant? har har
[3:07:22] <Kain5707> @ssjklyco shut up LUL
[3:07:24] <%Zeif00> 8 dots, 8 keys
[3:07:30] <%Agami23> i've seen tablet versions too
[3:07:31] <%TheMattman1313> @PatStaresAt you should also watch a video on how courtroom typists type. They don't use normal keyboards
[3:07:33] <splatty1> 8 keys = 8 dots forehead Kappa
[3:07:34] <%TIME_PUNCHER> @patstaresat stenographer keyboards work this way, Pat
[3:07:34] <%SirGO0SE> WHAT LETTER T?! psaWhat
[3:07:37] <Grunkle_Dan_> whoever came up with this needs to be given big prize
[3:07:39] <HammerAndArrow> i knew a blind girl in high school who used one its pretty cool
[3:07:40] <+Yung_FckUp> so this is how you do a blind playtrough?
[3:07:43] <%Pepp3r> Pepp3r subscribed at Tier 1. They've subscribed for 2 months! What are we looking at?
[3:07:43] <%BinaryFireball> was this made by RTS players?
[3:07:50] <%KeiganOfAstora> Dude, blind people NEED to be smart if they wanna stay modern
[3:07:52] <This_side_up_153> now make it a fightstick
[3:07:56] <%Jack_of_No_Trades> I kinda want to learn how to use this
[3:07:56] <%rdark_ksu> Thanks for the 2020Party @pepp3r
[3:07:57] <%doc_ock_rokc> @TheMattman1313 don't they use a keyboard based on phonetics?
[3:07:58] <%AncelDeLambert> @PatStaresAt some groups wanted to use chord inputs for tablet typing, to replace slow hunt and peck on touchscreen, but it never took off
[3:07:59] <%KineKithZen> Cue first blind guy using this to win next EVO
[3:08:05] <%BinaryFireball> modal keyboards are the shit
[3:08:07] <ShichiNoBushi> I had a blind classmate, and she had some neat devices such as a typewriter sort of things that had the 6 keys.
[3:08:07] <heartlesshealer> Accessibility technology is crazy as hell and great
[3:08:13] <%rdark_ksu> psaHoldon
[3:08:15] <%derekwst3> i would be lost trying to learn this
[3:08:19] <%Ipsenscastle> I'm always so impressed by the stuff blind people can learn to do
[3:08:23] <RyuuAoi> Man this some old bullshit!
[3:08:26] <%TheMattman1313> @doc_ock_rokc yep. Allows them to be able to keep up with human speech
[3:08:28] <%KeiganOfAstora> @PatStaresAt Do you have to change the stream from "Playing Project: Wingman"?
[3:08:28] <%NoHoldsBarredProductions> "Before I go on with my presentation, I'd like to take a moment to address the Twitch controversy surrounding blind playthroughs..."
[3:08:29] <%Agami23> i try to keep up to date on disability technology because my family has a history of working with people who have disabilities

[3:09:41] <%promessav2> woah
[3:09:42] <%Agami23> im glad you enjoy it
[3:09:44] <%KeiganOfAstora> Basically
[3:09:45] <%Quinnotetiquan> this costs 3000 dollars
[3:09:46] <%Ynkubus_> Thats because it is
[3:09:46] <Sol_Install> what the fuck is this wow
[3:09:47] <%greasypete00> HE DID THAT ON PURPOSE
[3:09:48] <heartlesshealer> it IS technosorcery

[3:10:15] <%TheMattman1313> Look up courtroom keyboards
[3:10:17] <Visorak6> Thats some crazy tech
[3:10:18] <%promessav2> imagine reading chat in braile
[3:10:20] <%AncelDeLambert> chord typing is technically more ergonomic and faster, but it requires you to memorize character inputs as opposed to key location
[3:10:21] <Sol_Install> this is super important to have!
[3:10:23] <%Engwithan_Elder_God> That is pretty damn cool.
[3:10:23] <%KeiganOfAstora> GOOD BIT
[3:10:25] <%AncelDeLambert> you can't hunt and peck a chord
[3:10:26] <switchbored505> That is incredible
[3:10:37] <%Lordgale119> spent all the computer money on the keyboard
[3:10:38] <%adzy2k6> That would be good for chat
[3:10:41] <%BinaryFireball> then post it on twitter coward
[3:10:41] <tattleworm> that's hard though and twitch don't have a lot of money to spend on such luxuries
[3:10:44] <%Zeif00> LUL

[3:10:47] <%honeyman18> Damn son, dragged

[3:11:30] <%MelBrooksKA> @KaiserMario It's not much better in english
[3:11:35] <ShichiNoBushi> Pat's back tattoo is a tengo, the Japanese analogue of a goblin.
[3:11:43] <%BoxNavy> TUBBS THE CAT
[3:11:48] <JaceDarkstar> the persinium mission was my favorite side mission so far
