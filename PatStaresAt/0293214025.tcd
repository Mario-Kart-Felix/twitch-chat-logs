[0:09:53] <$lolslowking> Red Balls
[0:09:54] <$WhereDoYouThinkWeAre> Redbull is stored in the balls.
[0:09:54] <SuperNotSuspiciousMan> That's how Pat keeps it FRESH
[0:09:54] <Ell1ot> This just in: Spiteful ginger ruins EVO, Smash players devastated
[0:09:54] <Divryne> Redballs blueballs.
[0:09:54] <@SSaryn> Pro tip: Every single fighting game is better than Blazblue Cross Tag Battle. Except Melee.
[0:09:56] <+sekoshi> easiest by the balls
[0:09:56] <+Alzero83> Redballs, Now with more Crack
[0:09:56] <JDRK> Ball adjacent

[0:10:06] <TG_Cid11> @AngriestPat So did they release MHW early?
[0:10:08] <+TaliTenenbaum> wait are you cancelling the stream again Pat
[0:10:09] <aeravon> Hi Pat! Where's Peach?
[0:10:10] <%MaiHusbando9S> ball-adjacent
[0:10:10] <+Flambage> He puts it under his balls to warm it up better
[0:10:11] <suikudo> Got some that ginger ball spyCheese on his energy drink
[0:10:11] <$googleygareth> Diet Red bull is trash. GO REGULAR OR GO HOME.
[0:10:11] <+vaporwhisp91> Since Paige isn't here, I have to ask. Are you wearing underwear today? @AngriestPat
[0:10:13] <Etherealizer> I mean lets be real here whats the point in having balls if you cant nestle a drink up against them
[0:10:17] <+PipIV> speedrun?
[0:10:17] <Spydurman> You guys know how Pat has a ball that he can suck in? He stores Redbulls up there
[0:10:18] <+fahsky> my Reinhardt kitty boy came home, I'm so happy
[0:10:19] <%Remery_> @SSaryn but what about RWBY?
[0:10:19] <%Jpdodds> Hey Pat how about that new Star Trek? We get more Jean-Luc, but at what cost?
[0:10:21] <%TeaJayGee> does Pats balls have wings?
[0:10:25] <$WhereDoYouThinkWeAre> How are you and Bunnyhop playing it
[0:10:25] <@SSaryn> @Remery_ No

[0:10:40] <+JoeStillLife> Pat sells out
[0:10:41] <+Axe_of_Eastmarch> Damn
[0:10:44] <+chimaera24> @AngriestPat Why are you playing this version instead of fighting behemoth?
[0:10:45] <ahmenthi> i dodged the ecliptic meteor with jump but two other people died and failed the quest :(
[0:10:45] <@SSaryn> Give me the MHW loops brother
[0:10:47] <%D_day> CAP-CPOM
[0:10:48] <SuperNotSuspiciousMan> emphasis on BEGGED
[0:10:48] <%galaxyswirl> yea the big sell outs
[0:10:48] <triplegyro> the capcops infiltrated the zaibatsu
[0:10:52] <MeAuntieNora> Does that make him an influencer
[0:10:52] <+RenzoTheLion> its that easy huh
[0:10:54] <+Flambage> Pat may have promised to suck someones dick for monster hunter
[0:10:56] <AncelDeLambert> with fecking Denuvo, because Capcom is dumb
[0:10:56] <+fahsky> "nice people" "CAPCOM" HAHAHAHAHAHA
[0:10:58] <+TaliTenenbaum> may i pls get MWH loops brother
[0:11:01] <+whiskywolfe> He was fooled by your pathetic charm!
[0:11:01] <Prevot> @AngriestPat ask Capcom for some early MHGU too 👀
[0:11:03] <+alphonseisbest> pat beg
[0:11:03] <$googleygareth> Did you do a fortnite dance for him @AngriestPat ?
[0:11:04] <+TaliTenenbaum> rathalos loops
[0:11:15] <dsauce999> BEGGED = SUCKED DICK
[0:11:18] <killenbigbugs> you bitch
[0:11:25] <%Remery_> Behemoth is fine, but randoms suck so much dick
[0:11:31] <DusK_The_Stray> capcom arèn't good people, but the Monster Hunter devs are great.
[0:11:31] <%Remery_> It
[0:11:31] <+KingZaffy> Behemoth is a permanent addition
[0:11:32] <Ell1ot> which monster was the pickle monster?
[0:11:35] <%D_day> WRONG
[0:11:37] <+taterboy09> Hi Pat
[0:11:42] <rjj25> but it's going to be the same
[0:11:42] <NonAddictiveSlurm> Denuvo is the only reason im staying away till GOG pulls a miracle
[0:11:45] <%Remery_> It's almost like they clicked through all the Directions
[0:11:47] <+PipIV> hm
[0:11:49] <+Tonku_the_Red> Behemoth is permanent. You can fight him ant time.
[0:11:52] <%Jpdodds> @Ell1ot Deviljho
[0:12:00] <MZess> World definitely isn't going to run on my PC so I guess I'll just pick up Gen Ultimate when that drops on the switch at end of this month
[0:12:01] <drfaustisdead> Pat confirmed for massive coward!
[0:12:07] <%ZombehTaco879> that's amazing to hear!
[0:12:07] <suikudo> @Tonku_the_Red is that confirmed?
[0:12:07] <EuropantLamprey> Who is ready for an hour of donation reaings?
[0:12:07] <deviljhojho94> deviljho was worth it you fucks
[0:12:08] <AncelDeLambert> I don't think Denuvo will hurt my machine, but it certainly doesn't fucking help
[0:12:11] <XeroCXP> Hey Pat! You excited fer Monster Hunter on Switch?
[0:12:11] <SuperNotSuspiciousMan> Pat is no longer friends with PS4 version
[0:12:14] <CptHarlok> Behemoth's no joke either. Damn thing's a pain in the ass to pub.
[0:12:15] <%Jpdodds> @AngriestPat Hey Pat how about that new Star Trek? We get more Jean-Luc, but at what cost?
[0:12:16] <+fahsky> @dusk_the_stray yeah, I agree with that statement. Capcom are the villains
[0:12:17] <%TeaJayGee> better have made a cute girl this time
[0:12:19] <$WhereDoYouThinkWeAre> Siege :) :) :)
[0:12:23] <deviljhojho94> ye
[0:12:24] <mercado94> you are already crazy
[0:12:26] <%Sora20030c> no you aren't
[0:12:26] <deviljhojho94> i mean na
[0:12:26] <+213372bu> No
[0:12:27] <MeAuntieNora> Kinda no
[0:12:27] <+JoeStillLife> YES IT IS OVERBLOWN
[0:12:28] <+Orion1189> no
[0:12:28] <cyberdogz> Eeeey pc hype
[0:12:30] <+PipIV> eh
[0:12:30] <ahmenthi> you're gonna mod behemoth into a tiddy demon aren't you?
[0:12:30] <+alphonseisbest> @angriestpat u still gonna stream gen ultimate?
[0:12:31] <+RCtiger0> Well they did sue the guy to cracked it
[0:12:33] <%Ninestempest> It is 100% overblown
[0:12:33] <%Sora20030c> I literally couldn't care less
[0:12:33] <+Orion1189> it is overblown
[0:12:34] <Prevot> denuvo is trash
[0:12:36] <DesuDesuDokiDoki> well u r crazy
[0:12:37] <dsauce999> PAT THE COWARD
[0:12:37] <Mr_216> Yes
[0:12:38] <Leebrownie> look at steam curator reviews, most of them as just denuvo shitlisting
[0:12:43] <MeAuntieNora> exactly
[0:12:43] <+OceanGovernor> MONSTER HUNTER
[0:12:43] <MoonMaidenMinerva> @angriestpat
[0:12:44] <%craig_t> i've had tons of denuvo games run fine on my laptop
[0:12:45] <AncelDeLambert> it depends on your machine, I hear
[0:12:46] <rararasputino> genuinely fucks performance on a lot of games
[0:12:46] <zaptar13> What's a Denuvo?
[0:12:46] <$GohanEgret> because it always gets cracked then removed, so why bother
[0:12:47] <+Tonku_the_Red> @suikudo Yes. It's not an event quest, nor do the in game messages indicate a time limit on Behemoth.
[0:12:49] <killenbigbugs> its on the same engine as DMC 4 so of course its fine
[0:12:49] <rjj25> it is 100% not overblown
[0:12:52] <gooeychild> @AngriestPat So Pat, is it true?
[0:12:53] <DaubDatchery> cheer1000 Hey pat been a big fan for years and just started getting into watching streams. You and Woolie got me into the Souls series and JoJo, and you and Matt rekindled my love of survival horror. Thanks for the years of entertainment
[0:12:53] <Tonyzx15> oh it is so overblown
[0:12:55] <%gusdabus91> orange privaledge is real
[0:12:57] <Mr_LupLup> Denuvo will always be a piece of shit, but it isn't the BIGGEST piece of shit
[0:13:00] <djjazzyj555888> Question, is the biggest difference between pc and console just graphics and load times
[0:13:00] <%Ninestempest> Denuvo sucks but companies wanna make money and it's only bad if it's a constant phone home shit
[0:13:01] <%ZombehTaco879> apatWrong apatWrong apatWrong
[0:13:02] <+deathman00789> AC Origins still runs like shit
[0:13:02] <AncelDeLambert> @zaptar13 it's DRM bs
[0:13:04] <tkoham> 99% of the people who make a big ruckus about Denuvo are salty linux nerds who want games on GNU/linux
[0:13:04] <+OblivionSword1> @angriestpat are you just going to play MHW on pc now ?
[0:13:04] <+Orion1189> Capcom straight up put a rootkit in SFV. Denuvo is the least of our worries.
[0:13:07] <rararasputino> A lesser, completely avoidable worthless evil
[0:13:12] <%zer0_11> DRM is bad in general, but denuvo is overblown
[0:13:21] <Ser_Randal> Pat the shill
[0:13:23] <Mr_216> The RYUtkit
[0:13:27] <grayjammer> A lesser Evil is still evil, pat
[0:13:30] <$WhereDoYouThinkWeAre> Oh yeah remember when SFV has a RYUkit LUL
[0:13:33] <tkoham> @AngriestPat the overwhelming majority of people who scream about denuvo are linux nerds
[0:13:33] <NonAddictiveSlurm> saps performance and general disrespect, at least it isnt Black Desert's rootkit
[0:13:34] <Bailey__gaming> @angriestpat did you get Paiges birthday gift yet?
[0:13:36] <dekkitout> atleast the drm isnt a cryptominer...
[0:13:37] <+RCtiger0> Well we didn't get the Xbox One DRM. Everybody remember that shit?
[0:13:38] <WeskerFinland> First time seeing Pat live! \o/ shame i need to go to sleep like right now x3 greetings from Finland <3
[0:13:39] <MeAuntieNora> I hear good things about PC version!
[0:13:40] <ahmenthi> it'll be a nice coaster
[0:13:40] <+gollum80> didn't the denuvo free version that accidentally released of FFXV run exactly the same as when it was added bakc in anyway?
[0:13:41] <Endlesslyforgetful> r u gonna get gen ult on switch
[0:13:43] <+whiskywolfe> Yay! PC Squad Fo Lyfe
[0:13:43] <Prevot> denuvo being less bad than the worst thing ever doesn't make it good
[0:13:43] <Aussie_Manny> @AngriestPat Can I have your PS4 version?
[0:13:46] <+PenmanLupine> oh boy
[0:13:48] <mercado94> he forgot!

[0:13:49] <Leebrownie> ELMO 2
[0:13:51] <SuperNotSuspiciousMan> Pat being SMART
[0:13:51] <AncelDeLambert> it's a pointless 3rd party DRM that doesn't need to exist, which is reason enough to be a piss-baby, frankly
[0:13:51] <Spydurman> is it a diamond ring?
[0:13:52] <+jkobe34> it's a cat isnt it

[0:14:15] <CaptainJudaism> Denuvo needs to be used properly. I forget the game that had it that did a check constantly which made it run like Garbo but as long as it doesn’t do that, it’s fine.
[0:14:16] <Mr_216> It’s a ring

[0:24:10] <Tonyzx15> I am probably going to be like Pat and fight Behemoth on PC when he shows up
[0:24:10] <GrayMatterMiner> gonna lose all my hard work qnq
[0:24:14] <dsauce999> Yeyeyeyeye THE PAIN OF OTHERS
[0:24:17] <+Mistheart101> All of a sudden I'm glad I don't play these games. And even then, my computer probably can't run them good.
[0:24:22] <CptHarlok> The MH side of it gets a pretty damned good IG set.
[0:24:23] <%Remery_> I didn't need friends in MHW until now :(
[0:24:27] <tkoham> I havent played monster hunter since Freedom 2 but I bought the PC version
[0:24:29] <ahmenthi> in comparison between the two, which one do you think will be worse?
[0:24:52] <%EvilWillYT> glad to finally catch a Pat stream live
[0:25:06] <%ZombehTaco879> ikr same
[0:25:06] <KoyaMusa> Sure Pat, Sure
[0:25:08] <+Tonku_the_Red> I will admit, the elitism from FFXIV player on MHW players is pretty annoying and unnecessary.
[0:25:12] <%Remery_> *Someone steals* instant death apatPorgmo
[0:25:13] <mercado94> WAIT hes going to play a game?

[0:25:20] <Psyramics> he's got at least anohter half hour of this before the game starts
[0:25:29] <+LastHazzerd> to those of you upset that we are 20 min in and haven't started the game, You must be new here

[0:26:07] <+blackkanye> I'm afraid to get MHW because I don't have any friends I trust to actually play with me
[0:26:08] <Prevot> I WISH
[0:26:09] <+TRYH4RDBL4CKGUY> Melee isnt going anywhere lmfao
[0:26:10] <NJigglypuff> huge doubt

[0:26:16] <Mr_216> LAST YEAR
[0:26:19] <nerotalkstoomuch> won't be. its viewership is pretty high
[0:26:19] <Mr_LupLup> Melee players gotta die out one day
[0:26:22] <deviljhojho94> YEAH, HOOKERS
[0:26:24] <gunstar73> doubt
[0:26:25] <+alphonseisbest> @Tonku_the_Red eh just deal with it for a week or two, it'll die down
[0:26:25] <+reemasbaid> been a fan for a while and am finally getting for into the streams. KEEP IT GOING PAT, WE LOVE IT
[0:26:25] <AncelDeLambert> the writing is SO BAD

[0:26:31] <%Gogogolem> Clip "I am gonan beat these hookers!"
[0:26:32] <%MaiHusbando9S> that shit had me actually in tears with prim
[0:26:33] <AncelDeLambert> AWFUL dialogue for such a good game
[0:26:33] <+whiskywolfe> To be fair, hookers frequently need better motivation.
[0:26:35] <Smithy4224> So, Pat or whoever in chat: is multiplayer a big help for Behemoth, or do I just suck at MonHun?
[0:26:36] <$GohanEgret> pat's greatest hits
[0:26:37] <%Remery_> Is this what monsters in FFXIV act like? Just casting spells?
[0:26:37] <deviljhojho94> LUL
[0:26:39] <+AudioOstrich> My favorite part of octopath is literally stealing from someone at the altar of a church
[0:26:40] <Quibbis> Dude Primroses story was the first thing I played in the demo of that, was rough to start on that tone.
[0:26:42] <+fornicus101> @AngriestPat charge blade haha
[0:26:47] <CharileMurphyPendelton> YOU DID IT WRONG
[0:26:51] <CharileMurphyPendelton> lol
[0:27:00] <+Tee_Ehh> How is Pat gonna player MHW on PC when it's unreleased?
[0:27:08] <+LastHazzerd> Folk keep complaining about H'aanit's speech like a bunch o children
[0:27:09] <tkoham> isnt beating hookers part of capitlism
[0:27:11] <%segbas2004> He knows people
[0:27:12] <@SSaryn> @Tee_Ehh Review copy.
[0:27:12] <mercado94> DAMN
[0:27:12] <+alphonseisbest> nope, u can solo
[0:27:13] <EuropantLamprey> CHA-REAL?!
[0:27:14] <+OceanGovernor> Pat has underground connections
[0:27:17] <AncelDeLambert> if you haven't started Octopath, START THE SCHOLAR. He auto-discovers at least one weakness on every enemy at the start of battle
[0:27:17] <Minorou> By the power of leprechauns
[0:27:19] <+Tonku_the_Red> @DusK_The_Stray FFXIV players are looking down on and agitating MHW players who are having trouble with Behemoth because the FFXIV players know how to fight him in their game.
[0:27:20] <%luna_ashford> Pat you lucky fuck
[0:27:22] <%Pendlez> I gotta get at that Behemoth
[0:27:23] <Smithy4224> Well crap in a basket. Good thing I have a friend to help later.
[0:27:24] <%cylish> @Remery_ Some do, casting meteor is a thing behemoth has done since like the regular nintendo days I think
[0:27:30] <+Tee_Ehh> @SSaryn Oh neat.
[0:27:34] <KoyaMusa> just do mechanics
[0:27:37] <CharileMurphyPendelton> Oh Shot Charlie. is spelt wrong FUCCCLKKK
[0:27:38] <CNExoSoul> @Smithy4224 Behemoth doesn't scale down to solo so yeah, MP is a big help, unfortunately most pubs just suuuuck
[0:27:40] <+Tonku_the_Red> @dsauce999 I won't be contributing.
[0:27:55] <%D_day> Pat I've died to Behemoth so much I almost have a full set
[0:27:59] <%Pendlez> just do the game good 4Head
[0:27:59] <+DarkNerdShawny> What does "Gun at Monster Hunter World" mean?
[0:28:00] <+Cobra743> Mechanics? TO WARFRAME!!!
[0:28:01] <$GohanEgret> lol matt is shooting on max's panel right now
[0:28:04] <+Superstarsage> change the game to runescapoe
[0:28:06] <+LastHazzerd> Cranky plays runescape

[0:28:10] <zaptar13> @charilemurphypendelton LUL
[0:28:11] <+Castle_Kundarak> I'm not sure Runescape will ever die.

[0:28:18] <AncelDeLambert> WOOOOOO
[0:28:18] <+DarkNerdShawny> This the PC version?
[0:28:19] <+OceanGovernor> I think you only need mechanics for sortie spy mission in warframe LUL
[0:28:19] <deviljhojho94> WWOOOOOW
[0:28:20] <DusK_The_Stray> lol @tonku_the_red Sounds dumb.

[0:28:26] <%LordlyBrush> wOw
[0:28:26] <AncelDeLambert> wow, that menu looks like SHIT
[0:28:26] <+drakthebest> What are the differences between the two versions? Also I remember you saying you would cheat engine your stuff from PS4 to PC, are you going to do that?

[0:28:27] <mercado94> HI
[0:28:28] <olwatshisface> @AngriestPat How is the port?
[0:28:29] <Quibbis> audio seems fine
[0:28:29] <DesuDesuDokiDoki> crank the volume up

[0:28:32] <AncelDeLambert> LUL
[0:28:34] <tkoham> time to peepee
[0:28:39] <sonofthedeepsouth> Go play Runescape
[0:28:42] <+whiskywolfe> I've been transported to a faraway planet - to a world where monster's rule
[0:28:42] <Minorou> old school runescape's been hot since they've been updating it
[0:28:44] <+DarkNerdShawny> Howd you get the PC version?
[0:28:44] <+jkobe34> what settings are you running at?
[0:28:45] <%Remery_> Wait how can a monster cast spells?
[0:28:47] <%Pendlez> wait he actually plays video games?
[0:28:50] <mercado94> audio its ok i guess
[0:28:50] <CaptainJudaism> Audio seems fine. Will report back when there is action.
[0:28:52] <CharileMurphyPendelton> -_- fml. !DISLEXIA AT RISK!
[0:28:56] <SuperNotSuspiciousMan> podcast over
[0:28:56] <nukle0nik> it's a shame cross-progress isn't a thing anyone seems to strive for, i'd buy this again for PC if i could play my PS4 character

[0:29:03] <+drakthebest> What are the differences between the two versions? Also I remember you saying you would cheat engine your stuff from PS4 to PC, are you going to do that?
[0:29:03] <DesuDesuDokiDoki> crank it!
[0:29:05] <%nocko_> Fuck Im broke but i need this in my life
[0:29:10] <AncelDeLambert> yeah, we gotta wait until you start playing the game to comment on the audio
[0:29:14] <+Helghast102> Does the PC port have the option for PS buttons?
[0:29:14] <+Cobra743> start cheating you fuck
[0:29:16] <+JoeStillLife> keep the fog shit off
[0:29:17] <+Tonku_the_Red> @DusK_The_Stray Yeah, but I expected it. Even so, it's still annoying that the game community still has to act so immature.
[0:29:18] <DusK_The_Stray> @smithy4224 it's definitely easier in multiplayer, even with randoms. I usually try to solo everything and I haven't been able to due to time, but I also don't have the constant motivation I used to.
[0:29:20] <tkoham> does it crash tho
[0:29:23] <AncelDeLambert> daaaaayum
[0:29:25] <+MONSTRx_x> pat is comfy at home while Woolz and Matt is doing labor for Max LUL
[0:29:28] <+superchronicc> how are the keyboard controls for this game, or have you not tried them?

[0:29:35] <+bustawof> Thats some knawledhe
[0:29:42] <+OblivionSword1> all the way to arabic damn
[0:29:43] <tkoham> @AngriestPat you have a Titan xp so you dont actually know how it performs on mere mortal GPUS
[0:29:44] <$GohanEgret> korean, yes
[0:29:49] <%Pendlez> try getting Irish @mr_luplup
[0:29:51] <DesuDesuDokiDoki> korea?
[0:29:55] <tkoham> hangul
[0:29:57] <%zer0_11> why is arabic in english
[0:30:00] <Smithy4224> I will say, the little touches in this Behemoth quest are cool. But damn is he tough. I just don't have that MMO raid mentality.
[0:30:06] <+OceanGovernor> Truly we are the Monster Hunter World
[0:30:07] <Prevot> put the voices to MH language NotLikeThis
[0:30:07] <+LastHazzerd> you can identify korean by the lil circles
[0:30:08] <%Remery_> German randoms players are fun to see
[0:30:12] <%mister___doctor> and they're all horribly lip synced
[0:30:12] <nukle0nik> @Mr_LupLup same with danish and all other european languages that aren't EFIGS
[0:30:12] <Mr_LupLup> @Pendlez Truly, we are of forgotten nations
[0:30:16] <AncelDeLambert> Korean is in Korean but Arabic is in Roman alphabet, lol
[0:30:20] <+Tonku_the_Red> Titan Pascal is still good stuff.
[0:30:22] <Daxalog> Pacifist Graphics Card

[0:30:43] <%ZombehTaco879> oof
[0:30:50] <Daxalog> Arent graphics cards down in price now?
[0:30:53] <Youmudesu> you can uncap the fps
[0:31:01] <%segbas2004> around 4k 60 FPS is all you can run on.
[0:31:02] <%Pendlez> hey! cryptocurrency is the worst!
[0:31:08] <+SpiceMastah> Damn playing monster hunter during evo is the move huh
[0:31:15] <nukle0nik> what the hell is "Z-Prepass"
[0:31:16] <+LastHazzerd> pretty sure the leading models are still bloated in price
[0:31:18] <KaiserMario> So... did Woolie drown in the pools already?
[0:31:19] <%GarbageNirvana> !uptime
[0:31:19] <@Moobot> I've been playing this game for how long? Oh only 31m 21s.
[0:31:19] <AncelDeLambert> I'm lucky, I bought my graphics card before this bitcoin nonsense
[0:31:20] <Prevot> MH with a good framerate, haven't seen this since 4U on New 3DS
[0:31:21] <Daniel_Is_I> Dynamic fog is apparently killer on framerate
[0:31:22] <Mr_LupLup> @Pendlez Because we never get international shit in Dutch, I'm now better at english. it's weird.
[0:31:25] <+RCtiger0> Optimization is progress
[0:31:27] <DesuDesuDokiDoki> perfectly calibrated
[0:31:28] <%kenpachi9211> over 8 Million copy's sold

[0:31:30] <Diabhalla> yo, does it have ultrawide though?
[0:31:45] <+bustawof> warframe is getting air combosin the new melee update
[0:31:48] <%Pendlez> @mr_luplup that's a fuckin mood. It's weird to have your native language drop in quality
[0:31:50] <+SpiceMastah> Hope crypto crashes really bad so all the dudes selling their homes to invest go broke tbh
[0:31:51] <%Jpdodds> Feels like TotalBiscuit NotLikeThis
[0:31:55] <+WhyIDie> did pat get an early copy for pc or is there some way for plebs to also play it right now?
[0:32:05] <Mr_LupLup> @Pendlez Boy it sure is
[0:32:14] <tkoham> @AngriestPat thanks for being real about the settings, turning off HBAO and special AA off should help immensely too. Have you tried process lasso?
[0:32:14] <Nordguy> ...man, I forgot the port came out today...
[0:32:21] <@SSaryn> 1080TI will probably be right at 60fps at Highest which I will LOVE.
[0:32:22] <Quibbis> not out yet Nord
[0:32:24] <AncelDeLambert> miss TB :(
[0:32:28] <Tisaric> I'm so glad TB's insistence to show this stuff off is more normal now
[0:32:29] <crimsonharvest> Pat whats your CPU and how's the threading in the game?
[0:32:33] <Nordguy> my bad sugoiAwawa
[0:32:36] <Daniel_Is_I> Plus if you're a MH veteran you're used to 3DS graphics so even Low will look amazing lol
[0:32:36] <%EvilWillYT> So i should stick to 1080p with my 1070, that's good enough for me honestly
[0:32:41] <Xenoforever> @AngriestPat Can a normal person get PC access early? Is there a disadvantage to doing so?
[0:32:46] <%Pendlez> do people still have that weird wax texture on their face?
[0:32:46] <NecDW4> WOO! Monstar huntan!
[0:32:48] <+Cobra743> cheer200 quit talking and start cheating you ginger fuck.....you said you would when the pc version came out...don't make yourself a liar, theres recorded evidence
[0:32:49] <+JoeStillLife> Fuck the Fog
[0:32:51] <+shinpete> Play on 4K at LOW settings 4Head
[0:32:52] <NonAddictiveSlurm> @angriestpat i built to RE7 reccomended with a gtx1060 6gb, that good for 1080 60 fps
[0:32:58] <+DarkNerdShawny> These graphics look great on this 720p stream lol
[0:32:59] <+Mistheart101> Volumetric fog is some BULLSHIT
[0:33:00] <+OceanGovernor> Ah its always the fog
[0:33:06] <+fishcakenin> Woahhh he got this early?
[0:33:07] <%Dingus_Tickler> 750 TI Poverty Boyz represent \ bukOld /
[0:33:17] <SuperNotSuspiciousMan> Fog = FPS destroyer
[0:33:19] <%Pendlez> launch PS4 boys Kappa
[0:33:22] <+Mistheart101> I woulda played the shit outta Doom 2016 but I had to refund it because the damn fog (which you can't turn off) made lag happen.
[0:33:28] <%segbas2004> Turn it off, free frames!
[0:33:35] <+shinpete> @Dingus_Tickler FeelsBadMan
[0:33:41] <@SSaryn> Z-Prepass for anyone who doesn't know is essentially a slightly lower quality bump mapping.
[0:33:42] <+MONSTRx_x> got that 660ti i'll barley be able to play it
[0:33:44] <KoyaMusa> can't cheat yet

[0:34:08] <@ThePlotHole> Oh dude the load times on an SSD
[0:34:11] <+RCtiger0> Just got a Rx Radeon 560. I don't think I will be able to play this.
[0:34:13] <@ThePlotHole> It's BEAUTIFUL
[0:34:14] <%Dingus_Tickler> @shinpete I’ll probably throw down at most $300 on a new CPU or Graphics Card on Cyber Monday anyway
[0:34:15] <+Tonku_the_Red> @AngriestPat Does your copy have the crash fix patch or should we expect funsies later?

[0:34:43] <AncelDeLambert> that was fast? Holy crap what is wrong with consoles
[0:34:46] <+jkobe34> the pc version is worth it for that alone
[0:34:50] <nukle0nik> i have an SSD attached to my PS4 via USB and it's not as fast as this but it's much, much, much faster than just the HDD it comes with
[0:34:51] <%Dingus_Tickler> Playing Dark Souls 2 on an SSD vs playing it on PS3 OMEGALUL
[0:34:54] <%Remery_> I can't making a sandwich with those load times :(
[0:34:56] <tkoham> @JoeStillLife provided you turn any HQ AA and HBAO off
[0:34:58] <+MellowYellowFellow> consoles are sooooo slow at loading this game
[0:35:00] <%keksisblyat> Hey @angriestpat really hype for the pc release! Gonna be playing the game as soon as it comes out!
[0:35:10] <+Xalgar> @AngriestPat Does the PC version support PS4 button layouts?
[0:35:11] <Prevot> you still can't sort at the quest board tho NotLikeThis
[0:35:12] <@ThePlotHole> Yeah, expect Deviljho within, like, a couple weeks of launch, in my mind
[0:35:14] <Smithy4224> Ah, so that's where that "optimized loading" went. riffLUL
[0:35:16] <%Dingus_Tickler> on an SSD on PC**
[0:35:24] <+RCtiger0> I have an SSD for my OS and a HDD at 7200 rpm for my games. Will that still slow down load times?
[0:35:26] <$LocDogX86X> micPawb micLurk Heyooo Everyone !!
[0:35:26] <%VoxNoctemz> I thought the game comes out on Aug 9th? Is this early access?
[0:35:31] <tkoham> @Xalgar steam lets you remap to whatever so yes
[0:35:33] <$hatesdps> how do we get in the pat discord?
[0:35:36] <President_valentine> Pet the poogie
[0:35:42] <AncelDeLambert> gonna play this game with a guide open LUL
[0:35:44] <%ZombehTaco879> @angriestpat have you tried mouse and keyboard?
[0:35:49] <%Jpdodds> >Not Japanese VA TPFufun
[0:35:51] <+styr13> Does anyone know how big the install size for this is?
[0:35:52] <+Xalgar> @tkoham I mean visual on the hud
[0:35:53] <Criotos> @hatesdps you have to be a subscriber
[0:35:54] <nukle0nik> i recommend to everyone who games a lot on PS4 to get an SSD and put it in an external USB 3.0 enclosure
[0:35:54] <%EvilWillYT> oooooh, so that's how they're going to play this out... interesting.
[0:35:57] <+MellowYellowFellow> GROSS
[0:35:57] <AncelDeLambert> I'm not wasting time when "the real game starts after you beat it"
[0:35:58] <+SilverDevilfish> chugga chugga
[0:36:00] <@SSaryn> apatBig washout.
[0:36:02] <+Mistheart101> Oof
[0:36:06] <+Tonku_the_Red> @RCtiger0 Yes, because the game isn't stored on the SSD.
[0:36:06] <Smithy4224> Gotta get sacs from the Street Shark.
[0:36:07] <$GohanEgret> pat got this early, he's officially an influencer

[0:36:30] <Tisaric> IT EVEN LOOKS BETTER
[0:36:30] <%GummiBunnies> no wonder why i get bad frame drops LUL
[0:36:31] <tkoham> that gmeworks lighting middleware ayy
[0:36:34] <+LastHazzerd> huh
[0:36:35] <+Mistheart101> It looks way prettier without the fog.
[0:36:35] <%Pendlez> is this running on the switch?
[0:36:36] <AncelDeLambert> really, volumetrics huh?
[0:36:39] <+OceanGovernor> Wow you could see the flip in colors
[0:36:40] <KaiserMario> Hey @AngriestPat Do you think MHW will get any big story DLCs?
[0:36:41] <%EvilWillYT> Washedout go DOWN
[0:36:41] <%Dingus_Tickler> @rctiger0 No… Installing a game on your SSD decreases load times versus it being on HDD. Regardless, SSDs are 100% beneficial and you’re way better off installing OS on it before installing games.
[0:36:43] <+jkobe34> oh that's why the console version looks so washed out
[0:36:43] <@SSaryn> God this game looks so much prettier now.
[0:36:46] <Alien3isTopTier> Ugh, monster hunter.
[0:36:48] <+RCtiger0> @Tonku_the_Red Thanks
[0:36:49] <ErikQRoks> @AngriestPat is your system overclocked in any way?
[0:36:51] <nossiob> i am so freaking hyped to play MHW and i may not be able to play it on highest settings, but eitherway i will nerd the hell out of it <3
[0:36:54] <SuperNotSuspiciousMan> Colorful > hdr effect every time

[0:37:00] <+Crippl3> it looks bad and hurts the framerate too lol
[0:37:04] <+Mistheart101> I've had instances where I can't run games well because they have volumetric fog that you can't turn off. I hate it.
[0:37:06] <+Helghast102> volumetric lighting go down

[0:38:51] <+NiktenKing> ABSURD
[0:38:54] <SuperNotSuspiciousMan> WAS THERE A LOAD
[0:38:54] <cyberdogz> Oh y ah
[0:38:55] <@SSaryn> Once more, Load times on an HDD compared to an SSD will only be about 5-10 seconds slower, so don't worry.
[0:38:58] <%nitronLVIII> GOTTA GO FAST
[0:38:58] <ZizerX> Fast as hell boy
[0:39:02] <+NiktenKing> LUDICROUS SPEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEED
[0:39:04] <ErikQRoks> hey pat, is your pc overclocked?
[0:39:05] <+chaosbuckle> BUT ITS FFXIV!
[0:39:06] <Tonyzx15> Ahhhhhh that loads so fast
[0:39:07] <+Brewstamasta> No one could
[0:39:10] <+Mistheart101> Can someone explain the change there
[0:39:10] <+kingwzrd47> Man thats way faster than ps4
[0:39:10] <Yomandude> God bless SSDs
[0:39:11] <cyberdogz> I love ssd
[0:39:15] <+chaosbuckle> HOW CAN YOU PASS UP THAT CROSSOVER?!
[0:39:15] <captainspauldin> damn it not enough time to get a snack with those loading times
[0:39:15] <%Remery_> We're all the console peasants :(
[0:39:18] <%ScottishMadJacko> Maybe i should get a pc
[0:39:30] <nossiob> chat? can ps4 pro reach 60 fps in MHW?
[0:39:31] <SuperNotSuspiciousMan> God Bless PC's
[0:39:31] <+OceanGovernor> What was the console speed? I have avoided PS4 footage?
[0:39:32] <CptHarlok> It's an SSD. Any slower than that would be below avg.
[0:39:35] <+Tonku_the_Red> Hey gurl.
[0:39:38] <tkoham> @SuperNotSuspiciousMan oh, so you mean like, log encoding base? well yeah its referenced to the sensor, not the display medium. you're meant to edit it
[0:39:38] <nukle0nik> PCs are great but a PC like pat's isn't cheap
[0:39:43] <Smithy4224> I can honestly understand sticking with these load times. Geezus.
[0:39:49] <%Dingus_Tickler> @ssaryn That’s 5000-10,000 milliseconds that 100% of the human population can barely make full use of tho
[0:39:51] <+NiktenKing> SLAPS ROOF OF PC PORT: THIS GAME CAN FIT SO MUCH QUICK LOADS IN IT
[0:39:52] <CharileMurphyPendelton> WHERE'S ELMO PALOKO?
[0:39:56] <AncelDeLambert> PC Master Race indeed
[0:39:59] <+Txukasa> god the pc version of this is beautiful
[0:40:07] <+Mistheart101> Where's Elmo in GENERAL. Give us the prince of perch!
[0:40:16] <%segbas2004> I would imagine if your PC is even half descent you should have shorter loading time.
[0:40:21] <+kuervojones> Patrick! What is best weapon?!
[0:40:23] <+DarkNerdShawny> This looks great!
[0:40:23] <+comb1ner> how is he playing it on PC already
[0:40:24] <Quibbis> I'll take fucking anything instead of the Xbox version
[0:40:25] <%superchronicc> yo
[0:40:25] <tkoham> @nukle0nik if you need one for productivity anyway you can add the price of a console to that and get a good (reasonable) setup
[0:40:26] <+chaosbuckle> I kind of want to buy the PC version but I just can't do all that grinding again in the same game. For MHGU later this month? Sure but I've already put in an ungodly amount of time in World on PS4.
[0:40:26] <+comb1ner> says 4 more days on steam
[0:40:27] <@ThePlotHole> He's a bit wrong on that count. HDD load speeds are a good 50% or so faster than PS4 Pro
[0:40:28] <AncelDeLambert> good thing my main drive is an SSD
[0:40:28] <Tonyzx15> SO what you are saying is Get and SSD
[0:40:31] <+TRYH4RDBL4CKGUY> what gpu does Pat have?
[0:40:34] <Smithy4224> If only I had any faith in my computer to run this so quickly.
[0:40:35] <%Dingus_Tickler> Save Scumming? sbfpWipeouts
[0:40:39] <@ThePlotHole> It's pretty damn quick on PC
[0:40:39] <@SSaryn> Load times have been tested and it's definitely faster than a PS4 Pro across the board.
[0:40:46] <+Mistheart101> Same hat, Smithy
[0:40:52] <+X3nobro> GET UP ON THE HYDRA'S BACK
[0:40:53] <+Xalgar> Crapcom still can't make a solid PC Port BibleThump
[0:40:53] <+Helghast102> Already made room on my SSD for this, put FFXIV back on my HDD
[0:40:54] <%Remery_> Hunting Bow?
[0:40:55] <CaptHowdy_> greatly over exaggerating the problems, it was fine
[0:40:59] <CharileMurphyPendelton> @anceldelambert. YOOO! The Switch Master Race, Represent!!
[0:41:00] <+Mistheart101> I think this game looks neat as hell but I don't trust my PC to handle it well.
[0:41:02] <KTDelgado> NOT FIGHTING BEHEMOTH ON CONSOLE... DUSGUSTING
[0:41:02] <+NiktenKing> I honestly don't like high frame rate animations... makes the monsters look weightless :T
[0:41:02] <%ScottishMadJacko> Ive got the pro but loads still take forever
[0:41:03] <nukle0nik> @tkoham even so, a PS4 Pro is like 300 dollars on sale, and a PC like this is 1500 dollars
[0:41:09] <%VoxNoctemz> @AngriestPat Is your progress now gonna be reset when the game comes out?
[0:41:10] <+fishcakenin> @AngriestPat You gonna hit this up with Paige eventually?
[0:41:10] <duel_pro> You can get a SSD for your PS4 to help with load times aswell
[0:41:11] <+TRYH4RDBL4CKGUY> what gpu does Pat have?
[0:41:14] <clonexsniperx> but i don't know if i can go back to low rank though
[0:41:16] <%nitronLVIII> Pat get BIG
[0:41:19] <+Tonku_the_Red> Man, I'd love to pick this up on PC, but I've already sunk 200 hours into the PS4 version and I'm kinda attached to my good armor and weapons.
[0:41:24] <tkoham> @ThePlotHole depends on the HDD. If you have a 15krpm sas/scsi or you're on raid it'll be blazing fast
[0:41:27] <%ScottishMadJacko> @duel_pro really?
[0:41:33] <Prevot> We can tell
[0:41:33] <AncelDeLambert> Save the Elmo, Pat
[0:41:38] <+LastHazzerd> every weapon has a learning curve
[0:41:40] <President_valentine> It's really lenient
[0:41:48] <%Remery_> @Tonku_the_Red Yea I'm in the same boat with for Honor
[0:41:51] <%Dingus_Tickler> @ssaryn Of course, top of the line PCs blow out XboneX and PS4P by a landslide. Isn’t it: High PC > XboneX > PS4Pro > Med PC > PS4/Xbone rn?
[0:41:53] <KTDelgado> all he has to do is just spam two buttons jeez
[0:41:58] <$mandragoraroot> hows patty liking the ls?
[0:42:00] <+Txukasa> Pat : D whats in your rig ??
[0:42:02] <Silnix12> Anyone know if we can transfer files from ps4 to pc?
[0:42:04] <Ekaelis> So, are there weapons that would perform better on PC with mouse and keyboard?
[0:42:11] <tkoham> @nukle0nik you don't need a 1500 dollar pc to play the vast majority of modern games at 1080/high, and I said add it to the price of what you'd pay for an office PC
[0:42:11] <CharileMurphyPendelton> SWITCH MASTER RACE is > than PC master race. FIGHT ME
[0:42:16] <moreknigth> Hi pat,how are you man?
[0:42:17] <nukle0nik> when getting a PC these days #1 priority is getting an SSD, don't skimp out on this, it makes a massive, massive difference
[0:42:17] <+RCtiger0> How much memory do you need to play this? Will 8gb be enough?
[0:42:18] <SummonerMagno> yellow sharpness.. eww
[0:42:19] <%lutefiiisk> What the hell is up with the music?
[0:42:20] <AncelDeLambert> Precious Baby with his precious boomerang
[0:42:21] <+thefatfriend> @AngriestPat if you patch in a lot of the evasion ups foresight slash makes you god, and you can pretty much always be in red
[0:42:22] <@ThePlotHole> Also, for all y'all wanting to group up on PC: it uses Steam Groups instead of Squads
[0:42:27] <+kuervojones> Patricio! Which weapon would you say pwns all?
[0:42:29] <+Xalgar> Why use this WEEB TRASH weapon when you could be using a Lance like a true Christian Knight?
[0:42:29] <+LastHazzerd> man there needs to be vergil DLC with a longsword kit
[0:42:29] <+Rorinator> My pc outperforms ps4 pro with a 6gb gtx 1060
[0:42:32] <duel_pro> You can get a SSD for your PS4 to help with load times aswell
[0:42:38] <%MisterCrimson> @Ekaelis I'd imagine bowgun, but only during first person view
[0:42:45] <$mandragoraroot> its fine i think they
[0:42:46] <+OceanGovernor> @AngriestPat Have you tried out mouse and keyboard or only controllers?
[0:42:47] <@SSaryn> Music seems to be fine actually, could be wrong.
[0:42:49] <Quibbis> ^
[0:42:50] <$mandragoraroot> re not a fan is all
[0:42:51] <%Dingus_Tickler> Wide Range Audio?
[0:42:51] <%lutefiiisk> Sounded warped
[0:42:52] <+C0baltCrusade> i honestly cant tell what are in-game elmo barks or real life elmo barks
[0:42:53] <AngryPhant0m> what is he playing on?
[0:42:56] <%Jpdodds> Its fine
[0:42:57] <+bloomingzonda> have fun on your leapfrog tablet @CharileMurphyPendelton
[0:42:57] <AncelDeLambert> He means that the music is gonna get'cha
[0:42:59] <Smithy4224> @duel_pro Really? How's that work?
[0:43:03] <OrochiSheewa> sound is a little low
[0:43:04] <TimetodiveLTX> twitch needs a polling system for stream issues
[0:43:04] <+Tonku_the_Red> @Silnix12 No official word, but it's very unlikely that would happen. Each console uses different file types for saves.
[0:43:05] <%ScottishMadJacko> Need to look into a SSD for my pro then
[0:43:06] <Ekaelis> music tends to get distorted with some connection issues, refreshing the stream helps
[0:43:06] <KTDelgado> tail not cut off.... you scrub
[0:43:07] <TimetodiveLTX> like audio
[0:43:08] <Dragon_Batman> @Silnix12 I think they've said there is no import saves
[0:43:10] <OotsyMahDootsie> sounds like they're having that issue where the music is pitch-shifted down on streams?
[0:43:10] <+Xalgar> omg these frame drops are awful LUL
[0:43:11] <BigChiefBear> Why are you always streaming at the same time as MAX, also hi
[0:43:11] <%segbas2004> Music, sounds, everything is good on my end
[0:43:13] <%Dingus_Tickler> It’s the Wide Range Audio.
[0:43:18] <CaptainJudaism> Audio seems fine to me.
[0:43:18] <CptHarlok> I really hope they have something planned for G rank. High rank is kinda played out by this point.
[0:43:18] <%ymorn> I thought people hated longsword users
[0:43:23] <%Dingus_Tickler> there’s nothing wrong.
[0:43:25] <dsauce999> 4k audio hard to listen to Kappa
[0:43:35] <%IMDRanged> Damnit Pat. I thought you were with Mat and Woolie at EVO today
[0:43:36] <%Dingus_Tickler> HD Audio ONLY ON PC
[0:43:37] <+MellowYellowFellow> hahaha
[0:43:37] <DesuDesuDokiDoki> lol
[0:43:37] <nukle0nik> @tkoham well no i'm saying if you want THIS, which is 60fps 1440p on high, you probably need 1500, more if you don't already have a monitor and peripherals
[0:43:37] <+Crippl3> lol
[0:43:39] <CharileMurphyPendelton> 4k Audio a thong?
[0:43:41] <TimetodiveLTX> fwiw it's fine on my machine

[0:44:29] <moreknigth> hey pat,what are your pc spec?
[0:44:31] <%ymorn> Wait wat
[0:44:34] <AncelDeLambert> @AngriestPat repeat for this worthless scrub, what's the good weapons for a complete noob to start?
[0:44:38] <+SailingSaturn> I don't FeelsBadMan
[0:44:38] <SmithersDotTV> define decent though
[0:44:41] <+Yalre> I just got a new pc so im def getting it
[0:44:41] <+kuervojones> Pat, which weapon is good to start off with?
[0:44:41] <+sekirei04> How is pepe
[0:44:46] <%rdark_ksu> What constitutes decent though?
[0:44:48] <%IMDRanged> Warning: If you see "Pat" at EVO, he is an imposter
[0:44:53] <President_valentine> all my friends are on ps4
[0:44:54] <+drabberfaun535> are all the weapons in this game slow and unwieldy?
[0:44:55] <CptHarlok> That is unfortunately my situation.
[0:44:56] <+tehpatmarsons> thats not HBG PunOko
[0:44:56] <%Pendragwn> @AngriestPat fuck em, get new friends
[0:44:57] <nossiob> <-- i7-4790k, rx 580 and 16 GB of DDR3 ram...i am good to go and play the hell out of it^^
[0:44:59] <tkoham> @nukle0nik eh that's fair I guess, you can probably do 1440 on less than 1500 though
[0:44:59] <%lutefiiisk> You guys don't hear that? The entire music soundtrack sounds warped
[0:45:01] <+alphonseisbest> @angriestpat going through 4u,, got any good great sword amour sets
[0:45:02] <drfaustisdead> That's a lie Pat. You don't have any friends.
[0:45:02] <%Dingus_Tickler> @angriestpat When are you going to use the Hammer? It’s big and girthy, but has short reach, just like you 4Head
[0:45:03] <+MisterMusashi> @AngriestPat Just prepurchased today on Steam woopsWoo
[0:45:06] <nukle0nik> @kuervojones greatsword is pretty good
[0:45:07] <CybertronPrime> Good luck being eternally behind on content.
[0:45:07] <KTDelgado> not getting the slide attack.... wtf is wrong with pat tonight
[0:45:14] <+Xalgar> Does Dauntless still run like crap?
[0:45:17] <CharileMurphyPendelton> Toukiden? Freedom Wars? Soul Sacrafice? is > than Monster Hunter. FIGHT ME
[0:45:19] <NecDW4> Play with M+KB for shits and giggles
[0:45:21] <President_valentine> he's new to the long sword im guessing
[0:45:23] <Smithy4224> @drabberfaun535 Not at all. You want speed, I'd recommend hammer or insect glaive.
[0:45:25] <+DarkNerdShawny> @lutefiiisk sounds fine to me. Check your settings
[0:45:26] <+FluffNir> How does the xbone controller feel for MH compared to the DS4 tho
[0:45:32] <@ThePlotHole> I forget: does Rathain give poison or fire weps in this game
[0:45:33] <CNExoSoul> barroth LS ew
[0:45:37] <%lutefiiisk> The pitch.
[0:45:40] <%MisterCrimson> poison
[0:45:41] <Prevot> @CharileMurphyPendelton how can someone even be this wrong
[0:45:43] <%GarbageNirvana> Depends really
[0:45:45] <%superchronicc> this looks super smooth
[0:45:45] <%Dingus_Tickler> Poison
[0:45:48] <duel_pro> @Smithy4224 Id recommend watching Gaijin Hunters video for SSD in your PS4 Pro to see how it works.
[0:45:48] <BootyFriend> would a basic ass ps4 with a SSD load significantly faster?
[0:45:49] <+Tonku_the_Red> Tired enough to take a sword to the face without flinching. . .
[0:45:50] <Dragon_Batman> @lutefiiisk are you on mobile?
[0:45:50] <%GarbageNirvana> Some poison, some fire
[0:45:52] <tkoham> @CharileMurphyPendelton I would fight you but that means I'd have to climb into the dumpster to throw hands
[0:45:52] <$velgaduere> @lutefiiisk I think something might be up with your audio, my guy. song sounds the same as it ever did over herw
[0:45:53] <Quibbis> xbone controller feels fine for MH imo, never felt anything off with it
[0:45:53] <CNExoSoul> @ThePlotHole both depending on what it hits you with
[0:45:54] <@ThePlotHole> Ah, ok
[0:45:54] <KTDelgado> NOT AIMING FOR THE TAIL
[0:45:59] <DrkJP520> R2 after foresight slash connects to lvl up sword
[0:46:02] <+drabberfaun535> @Smithy4224 the hammer is fast?
[0:46:02] <%lutefiiisk> Nope.
[0:46:03] <crimsonharvest> I love Lance's counter hit
[0:46:04] <Qashti> @CharileMurphyPendelton Stop tying to troll no one cares
[0:46:07] <+kuervojones> chat, which weapon should I start off with?
[0:46:09] <Prevot> counter the roars pat
[0:46:10] <CharileMurphyPendelton> @prevot more wrong than Pat?
[0:46:12] <moreknigth> : hey pat,what are your pc spec?
[0:46:18] <President_valentine> Use the slide attack
[0:46:19] <Ekaelis> cant get gud, get big
[0:46:21] <+MisterMusashi> I wonder how the KB+Mouse controls are anuThink
[0:46:24] <The_creepiest_man_in_chat> @kuervojones SnS
[0:46:25] <Silnix12> @kuervojones I found kinsect was fun to start with
[0:46:26] <SummonerMagno> just use insect glaive and jump like an idiot.. it worked for me
[0:46:28] <nukle0nik> @FluffNir probably the same? unless you are incapable of the assymetric layout
[0:46:31] <Smithy4224> @drabberfaun535 Relatively, from what I've seen. Never used it first-hand, though.
[0:46:31] <Qashti> @Prevot Hes a troll
[0:46:33] <+drewg91> I started with the great sword and it carried me for a while
[0:46:34] <+Xalgar> I hate that firefly crap
[0:46:36] <+alphonseisbest> @kuervojones charge blade
[0:46:39] <$mandragoraroot> you can foresight roars too
[0:46:41] <Dragon_Batman> the music sounds fine for me
[0:46:42] <%IMDRanged> Never played the PS4 or XboxOne version because I was waiting for the PC version.
[0:46:43] <jinking79> did Pat fight Behemoth yet?
[0:46:47] <CharileMurphyPendelton> @tkoham lol. dumpster wwe slam. I'll accept the challenge
[0:46:47] <alwayspronking> @AngriestPat you also can't raw foresight slash. It has to be after an attack.
[0:46:48] <+tehpatmarsons> how generous is the window for foresight slash?
[0:46:49] <@ThePlotHole> Yeah, music's sounding alright for me
[0:46:49] <+TamJamming> You can't use Foresight Slash raw, it can only be done after you perform another attack.
[0:46:58] <$velgaduere> @lutefiiisk well if you don't believe it's on your end, idk what to tell ya
[0:47:05] <President_valentine> it's pretty generous
[0:47:05] <+Rorinator> @AngriestPat are you using the shortcuts to spirit roundslash? You can do it with less than when you just go R2 R2 R2
[0:47:05] <OrochiSheewa> @kuervojones I've heard good things about sword & shield
[0:47:07] <A_d3adly_zambo> pat have u fought the behemoth yet?
[0:47:08] <+drabberfaun535> @Smithy4224 what about something like a dagger or some normal sized sword?
[0:47:08] <%MisterCrimson> @kuervojones all weapons are viable from the start, but the easiest to jump in with are longsword and hammer. They have very little nuance to them.
[0:47:10] <@SSaryn> Invincifal.
[0:47:13] <CharileMurphyPendelton> @qashti thanks for caring I guess lol
[0:47:14] <+MisterMusashi> INVINCIFUL kimpleWow

[0:47:16] <KTDelgado> not spaming y and b infinitr chain
[0:47:17] <CptHarlok> You might need to talk to a doctor if you think Toukiden of all things is better than Monster Hunter. Blood clots in the brain are a deadly thing.
[0:47:21] <%olliedelosa> Oh my god I’m so late he’s actually playing the game
[0:47:21] <+Xalgar> If you want to use consistent counters, just use a Lance
[0:47:25] <nossiob> does anyone know if we get a pre download before pc launch on steam?
[0:47:25] <dsauce999> INVINCIFUL
[0:47:25] <+Tonku_the_Red> Invinciful? Drink more Red Bull, @AngriestPat
[0:47:32] <+LastHazzerd> good enough
[0:47:33] <+FluffNir> @nukle0nik more or less a preference question :p
[0:47:33] <+Jajanken4> did pat get any crashes yet?
[0:47:35] <Dragon_Batman> Yes you can
[0:47:37] <$mandragoraroot> you still did a cool
[0:47:38] <Prevot> Monsters landing count as an attack, so always counter that
[0:47:39] <+Mrlasttruth> yes
[0:47:41] <%MisterCrimson> yes
[0:47:42] <+KShirahama> Yes
[0:47:42] <President_valentine> Yes
[0:47:44] <Psyramics> You can dodge roll them too
[0:47:44] <$mandragoraroot> you can
[0:47:49] <alwayspronking> Yes you can!
[0:47:54] <+TamJamming> @AngriestPat Keep in mind that you can't use Foresight Slash raw from a neutral state
[0:47:55] <President_valentine> you can
[0:47:57] <dsauce999> ye
[0:47:57] <jagchan> YES
[0:47:58] <Calamity2007> Can you transfer your saves from the PS4?
[0:48:00] <%Meme_Platinum> PogChamp
[0:48:02] <AncelDeLambert> WOOOO
[0:48:06] <Smithy4224> @drabberfaun535 There's Sword & Shield or Dual Swords for that. S&S is simple and flexible, DS is all about slicin' dudes.
[0:48:07] <%GummiBunnies> TAIL CUT YUM
[0:48:08] <nukle0nik> @Calamity2007 no :(
[0:48:13] <dsauce999> You can even foresight teo novas
[0:48:14] <+NiktenKing> YOU DON'T SAY
[0:48:15] <@ThePlotHole> Remember when Rathian and Rathalos looked like utter trash in 1st and 2nd gen
[0:48:17] <tkoham> @Calamity2007 ask fortnite players
[0:48:18] <Calamity2007> Great Sword is a great weapon no shame in it
[0:48:21] <CNExoSoul> @Calamity2007 not now at least, game's launching at 1.0
[0:48:23] <Dragon_Batman> watching Arekkz he mentioned a neat trick is to use the circle poke then the foresight
[0:48:25] <+LastHazzerd> i wouldn't say "too much" if you were doing it cuz you wanted to
[0:48:37] <+MisterMusashi> I wonder how the KB+Mouse controls are anuThink
[0:48:44] <+TamJamming> Yeah, stab into Foresight Slash is the way to go if you want to do it from neutral
[0:48:46] <Kitty_Maid> Can you play this game solo all the way up until the end?
[0:48:48] <Huunia> Think a GTX 1050 Ti could run this on mostly high?
[0:48:51] <xeros720> I found it easiest to do it during double overhand
[0:48:54] <+OblivionSword1> wondet pc is getting the jet booster great sword
[0:48:55] <$velgaduere> there's no such thing as too much time with the GS
[0:48:58] <+wunderkindest> @Kitty_Maid Yeah pretty much
[0:48:59] <$mandragoraroot> @Kitty_Maid you can do everything solo
[0:49:01] <Prevot> oh yeah this is awful to watch
[0:49:01] <%MisterCrimson> I'm ahammer main and I'm salty at longswords in general
[0:49:04] <+OblivionSword1> wonder if
[0:49:04] <tkoham> @Huunia on 720p sure
[0:49:05] <nukle0nik> i would suggest every PC gamer in this day and age to have a controller, unless you only play FPS and RTS/MOBA games
[0:49:06] <alwayspronking> Na, its a learning curve. You learnin'. Keep it up!
[0:49:07] <Calamity2007> So is this game worth getting if I already have the PS4 version?
[0:49:08] <dsauce999> LS MAINS LUL
[0:49:10] <AncelDeLambert> I can't wait to fuck around with the sword and shield
[0:49:17] <Qashti> GS sucks
[0:49:19] <CNExoSoul> @OblivionSword1 eventually yes, specially in festivals
[0:49:24] <AncelDeLambert> @Calamity2007 load times say "yes"
[0:49:28] <CharileMurphyPendelton> @qashti well it wouldn't be any normal Internet chat without a token troll amiright?
[0:49:30] <$SGrim> @AngriestPat as a long sword main, you are doing fine. Not great, but fine. Also, @dsauce999 fuck you, too. SwiftRage
[0:49:31] <@SSaryn> I mained LS in Generations but other than that I got nothing on World.
[0:49:38] <+FluffNir> OH
[0:49:38] <Ekaelis> whats the best soundtrack piece ingame? Xeno-jiiva part 2? Rotten Vale? something else?
[0:49:39] <@SSaryn> Adept LS 4 LYFE
[0:49:39] <+drabberfaun535> @Smithy4224 is the sword and shield easy to manuver with? like can i dodge reliably?
[0:49:39] <+TamJamming> @Kitty_Maid 95% of the game is completely viable solo. Multiplayer is only encouraged for like, two endgame monsters
[0:49:43] <+FluffNir> That's really weird
[0:49:43] <tkoham> @Calamity2007 depends on if you have a pc and frainds that also have PC
[0:49:45] <+RCtiger0> I only have a wired Xbox 360 controller. How is that nowadays?
[0:49:50] <%ScottishMadJacko> Any sword and shield mains here?
[0:49:51] <+Crippl3> lol
[0:49:52] <DesuDesuDokiDoki> kek
[0:49:52] <%MisterCrimson> hahaha
[0:49:53] <GrayMatterMiner> the one thing that beats the pc version down is no mods
[0:49:56] <%superchronicc> LUL
[0:50:01] <AncelDeLambert> did he pick up the tail+
[0:50:01] <%Meme_Platinum> and here come the asshole dinos
[0:50:01] <GrayMatterMiner> like fuck
[0:50:01] <$mandragoraroot> @ScottishMadJacko :) me
[0:50:04] <tkoham> @RCtiger0 fine
[0:50:05] <dsauce999> @sgrim my mocking of LS Mains is one of self-loathing :)
[0:50:05] <nossiob> does anyone know if we get a pre download before pc launch on steam?
[0:50:05] <AncelDeLambert> *?
[0:50:06] <Kadraxan> thrust into foresight is indeed one of the fastest ways to get to foresight, though you have a deceptively long recovery from all of your normal combo attacks which you can use to slow-roll a foresight
[0:50:07] <xeros720> a wired 360 controller is one of the best pc pads you can ask for
[0:50:12] <straxx_> So this is the PC version right now? Sorry, just got here.
[0:50:13] <%Unlimited_> what is he hunting?
[0:50:14] <CNExoSoul> @GrayMatterMiner they'll happen
[0:50:15] <Qashti> @CharileMurphyPendelton Stop talk to me i don't like you :z
[0:50:17] <nukle0nik> @RCtiger0 it'll still work but the xbone controller is a good upgrade, with the better d-pad and supporting bluetooth
[0:50:17] <%Unlimited_> oh rathian
[0:50:18] <%superchronicc> @GrayMatterMiner its only a matter of time
[0:50:20] <%CitrusDrink> Rathian
[0:50:21] <KoyaMusa> no you aren't
[0:50:23] <Calamity2007> @GrayMatterMiner I can kind of understand it though since MHW is a very online focused game
[0:50:25] <jinking79> slowly hate the ps4 control
[0:50:25] <DesuDesuDokiDoki> haha
[0:50:26] <Prevot> (X) doubt
[0:50:27] <@SSaryn> Just main Hunting Horn like a cool dude.
[0:50:27] <+NiktenKing> Even bowguns?
[0:50:27] <OrochiSheewa> I wonder if my 550 Ti could run this at lowest...
[0:50:28] <+yappari_> someone will probably mod the ps prompts in
[0:50:41] <President_valentine> Slide attack
[0:50:42] <+spookysenpai20xx> @straxx_ It is legit the stream title
[0:50:43] <+LastHazzerd> what a good elmo
[0:50:44] <Smithy4224> @drabberfaun535 Oh yeah. The shield also allows you to block, though it won't lower damage taken quite as well as a lance's big chunky shield.
[0:50:48] <Big_King_Coconut> Go Pat Go!
[0:50:49] <%ScottishMadJacko> I find sword and shield boring in most games but i have the most fun with it in this game
[0:50:51] <CookieCutter007> I'm praying for the ps4 prompts
[0:50:52] <+spookysenpai20xx> sbfpPat
[0:50:55] <+LastHazzerd> that was pretty good
[0:51:00] <The_creepiest_man_in_chat> can behemoth be soloed?
[0:51:04] <NecDW4> @straxx_ well, it says Pat guns at MHW *PC* in the title
[0:51:10] <Brainworm205> Kinda excited for Gen Ultimate tbh. Switch hunting in portable mode before bed is gonna be my new life.
[0:51:10] <DrkJP520> It's not that hard to learn all the weps.
[0:51:14] <+Subl3m3> how can you play on Pc already?
[0:51:15] <drfaustisdead> I want to see grade A Charge Blade play.
[0:51:18] <deviljhojho94> Pat you have to kill them
[0:51:18] <+Xalgar> Trying to land ground combos against Wrathian LUL
[0:51:20] <@SSaryn> @The_creepiest_man_in_chat Better have a game plan if you want to.
[0:51:20] <+LastHazzerd> I wish it was the KH behemoth
[0:51:23] <+wunderkindest> Capcom gave him a code
[0:51:27] <GrayMatterMiner> i know but like, mod support was a reason to double dip sans save transfer
[0:51:28] <+Subl3m3> ooh
[0:51:28] <$mandragoraroot> good work
[0:51:28] <CharileMurphyPendelton> @qashti lol aww I'm sorry. I guess you're alergic to my kind :(
[0:51:29] <+Crippl3> pat please
[0:51:29] <$Yakobro> naroXD
[0:51:30] <Prevot> LUL
[0:51:30] <+tehpatmarsons> cant wait to use glutton with KBM LUL
[0:51:30] <DesuDesuDokiDoki> lol
[0:51:30] <deviljhojho94> Pat, you HAVE to hit them
[0:51:37] <Dragon_Batman> @The_creepiest_man_in_chat in my experience maybe not for melee at least
[0:51:39] <AncelDeLambert> looks like crippling his wing was a bad idea
[0:51:41] <%keksisblyat> The important question is can you skip cutscenes on the pc?
[0:51:41] <dsauce999> LUl
[0:51:43] <Qashti> yeah the music sounds weird
[0:51:46] <nukle0nik> get the slinger ammo it drops
[0:51:47] <cyberdogz> Gettem
[0:51:51] <$mandragoraroot> use flash pods bro 4Head
[0:51:51] <tkoham> @AngriestPat how are the KBM controls btw
[0:51:59] <NecDW4> ^
[0:52:01] <DesuDesuDokiDoki> fine for me
[0:52:02] <5hady_> ^
[0:52:02] <%Ninestempest> Music sounds fine for me too
[0:52:03] <Smithy4224> @drabberfaun535 The S&S also allows you to use potions and such without having to holster it first, so that just adds to the flexibility. It's considered beginner-friendly, but no less effective than the rest.
[0:52:04] <+Rshiners> music sounds fine
[0:52:06] <@SSaryn> Yeah I don't know what's up, music is fine for me.
[0:52:09] <+wunderkindest> Yeah music sounds fine
[0:52:09] <SuperNotSuspiciousMan> fine here too
[0:52:11] <%ScottishMadJacko> its fine
[0:52:13] <%lutefiiisk> @Qashti I knew I wasn't insane.
[0:52:15] <+Peetuur> its a twitch bug, refresh
[0:52:15] <5hady_> screw using a controller on PC
[0:52:15] <dsauce999> Yeah, I heard ranged/bow is good for behemoth
[0:52:16] <%Remery_> No monster can out limp Sif
[0:52:17] <garbageheaphound> sounds fine to me
[0:52:18] <%Gogogolem> I know they are grabage
[0:52:22] <%Jjrossman> Early release for pat?
[0:52:22] <Calamity2007> Keyboard and mouse LUL
[0:52:28] <tkoham> music is fine
[0:52:32] <Dragon_Batman> @The_creepiest_man_in_chat but you can use plunderblade and break his parts to get everything you need to make the full set and weapon
[0:52:33] <$DavidCrimsonHeidern> sounds weird to me.
[0:52:33] <+Crippl3> @5hady_ but a controller is a lot better for a game like this
[0:52:34] <%EvilWillYT> i'm a game tester at a company Woolie might remember, due to work habits i'm going to touch everything in the game eventually.
[0:52:34] <nukle0nik> get a controller you troglodytes, it's 2018
[0:52:34] <5hady_> kb/m is where its at
[0:52:34] <+DarkNerdShawny> Keyboard and mouse LUL
[0:52:35] <Qashti> Chat listen closely
[0:52:37] <ZM_Anon> Elmo's so strong
[0:52:37] <TheHotStuven> When I get a new PC and this game, im gonna use my Switch joycons
[0:52:38] <+Rorinator> KBM is probably decent for bowgun
[0:52:38] <vingadivo> WTF IS THAT WEABO SWORD BULLSHIT
[0:52:40] <$velgaduere> music is fine here, but that guy also says great sword sucks, so he can't be trusted lobosLULN
[0:52:41] <tkoham> "who knows" Kappa
[0:52:47] <+MarioHead3> If the music sounds pitch-shifted, just try refreshing the stream
[0:52:48] <deviljhojho94> Fightan weaboo magic
[0:52:49] <%MisterCrimson> @AngriestPat okay Pat, hot take: What five monsters do you want to be added to World?
[0:52:54] <%EvilWillYT> not that i worked o nthis, just habits bleed through
[0:52:56] <The_creepiest_man_in_chat> @dragon_batman thanks
[0:53:00] <KoyaMusa> finally
[0:53:00] <5hady_> @Crippl3 disagree, ranged weps?, item usage?

[0:53:19] <Big_King_Coconut> PREY SLAUGHTERED
[0:53:23] <CNExoSoul> @AngriestPat pat, if you're hitting weak points two triangles and a evade slash (triangle + circle) is enough red bar to start spirit slashing
[0:53:23] <+Nohamforsam> PogChamp
[0:53:23] <+Crippl3> yaaaayyyyy

[0:53:26] <DrkJP520> R2 while sliding followed by R2 is an easy lvl up, in areas with lots of slopes. Needs a bit of meter
[0:53:26] <+RowenCleric> anyone in here beat behemoth yet?
[0:53:26] <Dragon_Batman> @The_creepiest_man_in_chat no prob.
[0:53:26] <%Meme_Platinum> PogChamp

[0:53:34] <SuperNotSuspiciousMan> amazing
[0:53:34] <Smithy4224> @drabberfaun535 If/when you start playing MHW, there's a very handy training room to just try all the weapon types to your heart's content. Great for getting a feel for any weapons you're interested in.
[0:53:34] <+NWR_James> where is THE GUN
[0:53:37] <Eposman> I want gore magalla

[0:54:14] <tkoham> @5hady_ 7700k titan pascal
[0:54:14] <BootyFriend> I'm just gonna hope for the best by sticking a SSD in my PS4
[0:54:15] <+OblivionSword1> is text chat a thing ingame ?
[0:54:16] <+TheSpartanThief> So Pat, the PC version. Stable and good? Cause I've pre-ordered and I don't want another unfortunate "Nier" situation.
[0:54:19] <Nova712> is this some kind of closed beta?
[0:54:25] <Prevot> it's so easy to build your meter tho
[0:54:26] <Dragon_Batman> @AngriestPat you can foresight the roar if your wondering
[0:54:30] <+Crippl3> hell yes
[0:54:31] <AncelDeLambert> Pat got a review code for streaming
[0:54:31] <%ScottishMadJacko> NO PRANCE? NO POINT
[0:54:35] <deviljhojho94> gotta let it out gotta let it out
[0:54:36] <ngb1423> Howd you get this on PC already?
[0:54:37] <CNExoSoul> @AngriestPat not foresight, evade slash (triangle + circle)
[0:54:38] <+RCtiger0> I thought Pat was going to big cheat and try to get all his equipment he had on the PS4 onto the PC
[0:54:39] <xeros720> they improved the execution on the foresight slash in one of the patches, might not be implemented yet
[0:54:40] <@SSaryn> Was a thing in PS4 as well, but who has a keyboard on PS4, that's dumb.
[0:54:42] <utgardar> @AngriestPat Do you know the file size for the download?
[0:54:43] <$SGrim> @AngriestPat it also has to be done as the follow-up to another attack. You can't just do it raw.
[0:54:43] <%MisterCrimson> BOO Capcom ruined the game with text
[0:54:43] <+OceanGovernor> I would hope there is chat LUL
[0:54:48] <%hatesdps> @AngriestPat now that im a sub how do i get in the discord i wanna see that mess

[0:55:39] <drfaustisdead> I wouldn't call smelter daddy a nerd...
[0:55:43] <+Crippl3> @Necroe not all SSDs are the same speed, plus processor still effects that
[0:55:43] <+LastHazzerd> i love the menus so much

[0:56:31] <DrkJP520> R2 while sliding followed by R2 is an easy LS lvl up, in areas with lots of slopes. Needs a bit of meter

[0:58:47] <tkoham> hammer is a dex weapon change my mind
[0:58:48] <+Dr_DangerPhD> Hammer all bout dat positioning
[0:58:50] <%CitrusDrink> Run up the mushrooms, do the big spinny
[0:58:51] <Big_King_Coconut> Knock Knock it's PATRON
[0:58:52] <%MisterCrimson> getting knocked down and sheathing I get, but losing your charge from roars, tremors and wind is dumb
[0:58:55] <+C0baltCrusade> beat the dragon with a fuckin stick pat

[0:59:08] <@ThePlotHole> Alright, who here played MH Tri online back in the day

[0:59:56] <Smithy4224> Slopes, the Hammer's home.
[0:59:57] <tkoham> lol red cut marks for crits on blunt weapons
[1:00:03] <%MisterCrimson> Stream Title Changed to: Man Beats Hot Girl with a Hammer
[1:00:19] <%Jpdodds> @tkoham He has to sharpen his hammer in a sec
[1:00:21] <Dragon_Batman> dayum elmo got ko'd
[1:00:21] <sonofthedeepsouth> cmonbruh let him kill u
[1:00:24] <WackyXmand> Hey everybody.
[1:00:25] <President_valentine> RIP Elmo
[1:00:27] <A_d3adly_zambo> does anyone know if pat fought the behemoth or he waiting for full pc release
[1:00:28] <+Dr_DangerPhD> Elmo tanked the poison for you lol
[1:00:30] <dsauce999> RIP ELMO
[1:00:31] <Daxalog> Sharpen..the hammer?
[1:00:33] <AncelDeLambert> oh, Paige is the birthdays!
[1:00:35] <element_of_loyalty> @AngriestPat Nice to see you're streaming.
[1:00:36] <%SneakyPenguin77> @Daxalog
[1:00:41] <%SneakyPenguin77> my thoughts exactly
[1:00:43] <AncelDeLambert> Happo birdai, Paige
[1:00:47] <xeros720> ginger gives his big lady friend the Big Bang Attack live on stream
[1:00:58] <Quibbis> works very well with insect glaive since you also attack as you switch positions
[1:01:00] <+C0baltCrusade> jesus
[1:01:01] <CNExoSoul> @AngriestPat when you're in the wildspire waste could you please go to the highest point and look towards the lake area
[1:01:01] <AncelDeLambert> and on her birthday, Pat plays MonHun
[1:01:02] <ScrapSentinel> Wait what's the plan for todays stream?
[1:01:05] <tkoham> @Jpdodds I know and I love it. at least that makes a sort of sense where you can say "maybe hes just cleaning it"
[1:01:06] <%Meme_Platinum> i like how hammers still have sharpness Kappa
[1:01:09] <vingadivo> fuking sick
[1:01:13] <DrkJP520> Run up mushrooms/shit on walls while charging hammer
[1:01:17] <element_of_loyalty> ELMO SHOW YOURSELF
[1:01:23] <%TeaJayGee> hill time
[1:01:24] <%CitrusDrink> Aw he didn't do the mushroom wall run spinny move
[1:01:24] <Thenuclearwalrus> Sharpening a hammer 🤔
[1:01:26] <AncelDeLambert> *Plinkett voice* I'd be tired too
[1:01:27] <sonofthedeepsouth> haaaa
[1:01:30] <Eresus> how is the pc version of MH so far?
[1:01:35] <WackyXmand> Now that's what I call Big Damage!
[1:01:36] <ScrapSentinel> The longsword is fucking confusing.
[1:01:36] <$mandragoraroot> its way more straightforward
[1:01:38] <alwayspronking> Hammer is like a blunt greatsword
[1:01:40] <+LastHazzerd> the hammer is more simplistic in concept, but difficult due to how it has NO RANGE
[1:01:41] <+Mugen4552> sharpens blunt object
[1:01:41] <Dragon_Batman> is it because it's simpler? but with positioning?
[1:01:42] <+elbishop> Hammer is much more fun to use
[1:01:43] <%Jpdodds> @Eresus Looks real good
[1:01:46] <drfaustisdead> Leave it to Pat to know how to hit a large woman in the face with a blunt object.

[1:01:48] <@Moobot> I've been playing this game for how long? Oh only 1h 1m 50s.
[1:02:03] <dsauce999> Range is for pussies Kappa
[1:02:05] <tkoham> hammer: sharp meat: well done bugs: in my slingshot lets do this boys
[1:02:06] <%ScottishMadJacko> Hammer is more entertaining than grwatsword
[1:02:17] <+C0baltCrusade> Redhead Beats Dragon with Stick Until Her Brains Fall Out (On Stream)
[1:02:38] <%MisterCrimson> I agree, as a person who has mained hammer pretty much forever, I agree
[1:02:40] <Dragon_Batman> That makes sense
[1:02:41] <+LastHazzerd> they just refer to it as sharpening for the sake of mechanics, when you use the whetstone on the hammer it's clearing all the gunk/grime/mud off it to keep it hard and not soft
[1:02:46] <+Helghast102> Hammers were my favourite weapons in God Eater, was considering them for MHW
[1:02:51] <WackyXmand> It was just charge slam run away charge slam run away. I can agree there.
[1:02:51] <+tehpatmarsons> so when do we get a rocket powered hammer???
[1:02:59] <Big_King_Coconut> Spin2Win
[1:02:59] <A_d3adly_zambo> hammers are the cool
[1:03:07] <+NiktenKing> Slide hammer attack is pretty sick too
[1:03:13] <Stari> @tehpatmarsons I want one
[1:03:14] <@SSaryn> Hammer got the most of EVERYTHING in this game. It's so good now.
[1:03:19] <AncelDeLambert> this seems like animal abuse, at this point
[1:03:24] <+elbishop> and it's satisfying as f
[1:03:26] <+Quarkee> i wonder if this works with the switch pro controller
[1:03:27] <CybertronPrime> I'm enjoying all the salt Behemoth is generating.
[1:03:28] <%CitrusDrink> The slide and walljump hammer moves are so great
[1:03:30] <%MisterCrimson> Closest it had was the meteor smash in MHG with Power style or whatever it was
[1:03:34] <+SailingSaturn> I wonder how MH will progress on Nintendo or hand held systems

[1:03:35] <@Moobot> I've been playing this game for how long? Oh only 1h 3m 37s.
[1:03:35] <+StrangeCoincidence> Did Woolie go to evo?
[1:03:41] <Smithy4224> Meanwhile I'm just a noob who likes being a bug-powered attack helicopter.
[1:03:41] <Heartless_01> yes
[1:03:43] <President_valentine> Yeah
[1:03:52] <+StrangeCoincidence> I haven't seen him all weekend
[1:03:54] <olwatshisface> hammer slide move is the best
[1:03:54] <xeros720> he's at evo, saw him on stream with Max
[1:03:56] <Big_King_Coconut> do you get any iframes or super armor when you swing the hammer?
[1:04:01] <htromak> stutters on a pretty beefy CPU sounds worrying
[1:04:02] <%Meme_Platinum> its nice to have this game coming to pc i just cant focus on a handheld console anymore
[1:04:11] <%SneakyPenguin77> Anyone else picking up a delay between Pat and the Game?
[1:04:20] <+StrangeCoincidence> thinking about buying this for PC
[1:04:21] <%TeaJayGee> remember kids, heads are for hammers. lost count of every time a long sword or dual blade has tripped me while the monster is down
[1:04:21] <Heartless_01> i like Gunlance. i have like 2k hunts with it
[1:04:36] <WackyXmand> It always was the face breaking weapon and this game focuses on that.
[1:04:45] <%MisterCrimson> @Smithy4224 the behemoth gear set bonus let's aerial glaive attacks do about as much damage as normal ground combos
[1:04:57] <SuperNotSuspiciousMan> in other words, Pat's PC is beef
[1:04:58] <+Mistheart101> Just turn off volume lighting
[1:05:00] <+Crippl3> turn off fog, turn down shadows, that's how I play every game
[1:05:12] <+Crippl3> shadows always kill framerates in like every game
[1:05:22] <Smithy4224> @mistercrimson Oh yessss~ Only downside is having to grind Behemoth parts...
[1:05:24] <AncelDeLambert> BOOM
[1:05:24] <$mandragoraroot> nice
[1:05:32] <DesuDesuDokiDoki> BOOM
[1:05:39] <dekkitout> was that crazy talk or did i mishear him
[1:05:40] <%GummiBunnies> damn
[1:05:46] <+Dr_DangerPhD> hammer builds for multi pair super well with mount/jump gems
[1:05:49] <%Remery_> Yea looked at eh Behemoth armor set and was like "this gear is for the flying guys" even that weird jump emote is for them :D
[1:05:54] <%MisterCrimson> @Smithy4224 if the full fight is giving you grief, you can get enough parts by grinding the repel mission

[1:05:55] <@Moobot> I've been playing this game for how long? Oh only 1h 5m 57s.
[1:05:56] <LordXenon> What about dual swords?
[1:06:00] <AncelDeLambert> get REKT
[1:06:02] <element_of_loyalty> LUL I love Pats crazy talk
[1:06:03] <SummonerMagno> choke choke choke
[1:06:09] <htromak> the volumetric shading or whatever, the thing that made the washed-out fog look, apparently is a pretty big resource hog
[1:06:10] <ScrapSentinel> The Jump emote has some super BS i frames on it
[1:06:19] <DesuDesuDokiDoki> choke?
[1:06:20] <%Remery_> The jump is a attack
[1:06:20] <htromak> turning that off might make the game look better on top of taking some load off
[1:06:26] <$googleygareth> Is that Elmo or is that "Elmo"?
[1:06:31] <%Meme_Platinum> a cutting hammer?
[1:06:32] <+NWR_James> I keep hearing Palico Elmo and thinking it's regular Elmo
[1:06:36] <+RCtiger0> A hammer with blades on the side
[1:06:36] <Psyramics> it has one, I think. you poke it with the end of the handle
[1:06:38] <Smithy4224> @mistercrimson I'm kinda stuck on the repel mission anyway; waiting 'til Monday to try it with a friend.
[1:06:38] <%CitrusDrink> It's an attack but it only does like 3 damage
[1:06:38] <$mandragoraroot> NICE
[1:06:40] <+Crippl3> You can get busted open adn start bleeding from blunt traumer, it could work
[1:06:41] <WackyXmand> I played so much high rank of World that now every monster scream makes me think Bazel will come down.
[1:06:42] <indigocomet> have they defined what kind of damage spear does?
[1:06:42] <President_valentine> The bow is able to ko and cut
[1:06:43] <element_of_loyalty> Elmo is in the game
[1:06:51] <garbageheaphound> wouldnt a cutting hammer be a saw?
[1:06:54] <%TeaJayGee> theres already a hammer thats an axe
[1:06:59] <+LastHazzerd> KO
[1:07:03] <element_of_loyalty> DANCE
[1:07:09] <%CitrusDrink> Yeah the Vaal Hazak hammer has an axe model

[1:07:16] <%Lion_kun> he was only doing 40 damage
[1:07:24] <%Sirculbs> Can't beat behemoth... Rando's keep failing me.
[1:07:26] <+ParagonIsaac> so is it pronounced pay-tron or pah-trone rooThink

[1:16:21] <ScrapSentinel> @AngriestPat what kind of caffeine are you poisoning yourself with today?

[1:18:19] <%MisterCrimson> Do people really have a hard time fighting Paolumu?
[1:18:21] <%RittiFruity> Pat, have you fought against Behemoth?
[1:18:23] <@SSaryn> Time to go half-way across the map Kappa
[1:18:24] <CNExoSoul> @Smithy4224 i'd be happy to hunt with you some other time then =)
[1:18:25] <Prevot> Lavasioth sucks cause he stole the gimmick of a way better monster
[1:18:26] <%Remery_> muthafucka swimming in lava wasting my time >.>
[1:18:31] <KatabolicRage> hard is the wrong word, it's more like... tedious? or annoying?
[1:18:38] <element_of_loyalty> Cooing Doves
[1:18:42] <President_valentine> Yup, annoying
[1:18:44] <KatabolicRage> he flies around constantly

[1:18:58] <+Crippl3> kirin IS a fuck
[1:18:58] <%Dingus_Tickler> @angriestpat Do Wild Swing into Morph Attack (Circle -> R2), you’ll love it
[1:19:01] <htromak> flat damage and mind's eye make very quick work of lavasioth
[1:19:01] <5hady_> Behemoth sais hi
[1:19:01] <KatabolicRage> try kiran in fucking MHFU
[1:19:04] <+SergeEXE> Behemoth made me learn Lance and Insect Glaive. The nerve
[1:19:05] <Sarumarine> Kirin for worst monster
[1:19:06] <+Houdini111> Ugh. I hate Kirin so much.
[1:19:07] <element_of_loyalty> Bat Beaver
[1:19:09] <CNExoSoul> @Haughtymoss_ @Smithy4224 my psn is Equirah (Solarag Equirah mayg get a better result)

[1:19:15] <ahmenthi> lunastra a shit
[1:19:17] <@SSaryn> As a Greatsword main, I can still say Kirin is one of my favorite monsters. Fight me.
[1:19:20] <dekkitout> kirin's hard? but urgaan set...
[1:19:20] <KatabolicRage> that goddamn unicorns hitbox in FU made me want to die
[1:19:20] <element_of_loyalty> YYEE HAW
[1:19:21] <SummonerMagno> vaal can go fuck itself for me
[1:19:22] <tkoham> @AngriestPat do you wanna see tigrex come back
[1:19:23] <+Tokanova> i always sword when its charged
[1:19:25] <turbulentstriker> Behemoth is harder than, easily
[1:19:25] <htromak> Wide Gunlance makes sure at least your damage is consistent
[1:19:27] <President_valentine> Kirin is fun to fight
[1:19:28] <%MisterCrimson> gating the game behind tempered Kirin is a shitty decision
[1:19:28] <TyrantBelial> Sword is when you want to fuck them in the ass, axe is othertwise
[1:19:30] <HentaiSpyder> Kirin is a fuck becuse bounce.
[1:19:30] <Furfurlurd> is monster hunter world out on PC yet?
[1:19:38] <+Houdini111> Kirin is the reason why I still don't have the Link armor in 4U. And I beat every single caravan quest.
[1:19:40] <HUNTERX2X> same pat
[1:19:41] <%Dingus_Tickler> Axe for poking, Sword for smacking
[1:19:42] <+TamJamming> @AngriestPat The Wild Swing combo into Sword transformation is the best attack in Switch Axe's kit, so try that out
[1:19:44] <galaboi> Is he gonna fight behemoth just got here
[1:19:44] <HUNTERX2X> it was even my first weapon
[1:19:46] <turbulentstriker> I'm playing 3U right now, in fact. I main Hammer
[1:19:47] <$mandragoraroot> same :)
[1:19:47] <+camodikk> hows this running tonight?
[1:19:49] <+Houdini111> @Furfurlurd Nope. Thursday.
[1:19:50] <+SergeEXE> WHAP
[1:19:51] <%craig_t> @AngriestPat it's evo bbtg losers finals and i can't escape the dulcet tones of the producers daughter. plz help
[1:19:57] <Prevot> H I T B O X E S
[1:20:03] <Smithy4224> @cnexosoul Noted. Expect a friend request from JLS4224 in the middle of the night once I'm actually home.
[1:20:05] <ivansonic08> which controller is he playing with?
[1:20:07] <KatabolicRage> MHFU kiran is pretty bad, because all the hitboxes in that are shit
[1:20:11] <%Remery_> The only boss I had fun with was with Kirin because I can side dodge his lightning since I'm a Hunting Bow main. :)
[1:20:15] <element_of_loyalty> Paulo has no idea what to do
[1:20:17] <+Tokanova> i like switch axe because iot won't bounce
[1:20:18] <%SneakyPenguin77> @ivansonic08 he said PS4
[1:20:21] <%Dingus_Tickler> Sword Mode also has some armor against Knockbacks while attacking
[1:20:23] <$Dutchpotato> Unless this is a 12 hour stream he won’t be getting to behemoth
[1:20:23] <$mandragoraroot> i dont like what they did with it in this game. it feels weird to play
[1:20:26] <ivansonic08> okokok
[1:20:32] <IdainAuzkovyn> no behemonth?
[1:20:39] <element_of_loyalty> YEA YEA YEA
[1:20:41] <galaboi> is this old man gonna attempt behemoth tonight
[1:20:45] <+Crippl3> literally exploded his brain
[1:20:47] <TyrantBelial> Don't use the discharge it's less DPS then just using normal sword mode.
[1:20:47] <Notterr> Would you say MH is basically an online dark souls?
[1:20:51] <KatabolicRage> doubt it, behemoth aint on the PC version
[1:20:52] <SPidERMan8576> Jebaited Jebaited
[1:20:53] <NecDW4> well, behemoth isnt out on PC, nor will it be for a while
[1:20:53] <+Mikatonic> gosh this game is anime
[1:20:55] <KatabolicRage> they're going to stagger the events
[1:20:57] <tkoham> this hunter eatin beans
[1:20:58] <+Xanezz> so has pat been big cheating yet as he said he would?
[1:21:00] <KatabolicRage> over time
[1:21:00] <%Jpdodds> No behemoth. Behomoth not on pc
[1:21:03] <TyrantBelial> the discharge is next to useless besides to cap something off when it's about to get up
[1:21:04] <Rellim80> Touch your nose
[1:21:08] <carlsomanriquez> what's the name of that monster? it's awesome
[1:21:13] <+SergeEXE> @TyrantBelial false
[1:21:15] <%Jpdodds> Paolumu
[1:21:16] <$mandragoraroot> paolumu
[1:21:16] <+RCtiger0> I heard the PC version is going to the pre-patch state of the game.
[1:21:17] <birchpeninsula> Can the caffriend die?
[1:21:18] <galaboi> gosh dangit
[1:21:18] <$Dutchpotato> Oh I thought pc would just come with everything console has
[1:21:22] <%Ninestempest> @Xanezz most likely not possible with denuvo attached.
[1:21:22] <$Dutchpotato> That’s weird
[1:21:24] <+Xanezz> @carlsomanriquez paloumu
[1:21:27] <+SenorCounter> he's trying hard not to suck the ghost's dick.
[1:21:29] <carlsomanriquez> ty
[1:21:30] <+SergeEXE> @RCtiger0 Already proven to have QOL patches
[1:21:31] <+Houdini111> @Notterr The only thing they have in common is the commitment based combat (i.e., you can go around spamming moves). That's where the similarities end.
[1:21:32] <%Remery_> Paolumu the weird Bat-Bear creature
[1:21:36] <element_of_loyalty> @birchpeninsula Elmo cannot die
[1:21:40] <Prevot> >defence
[1:21:41] <ScrapSentinel> @birchpeninsula yes the cat can die, but they'll come back
[1:21:42] <+FeverPitch17> Paolumu is the monster's name.
[1:21:42] <HUNTERX2X> evade extender that shit man
[1:21:43] <%Dingus_Tickler> @tyrantbelial Discharge has good element inflict I believe. Also does well with high Affinity in your Zero Sum Discharge
[1:21:45] <TyrantBelial> For Sword Mode just to X->A->X->A etc.
[1:21:48] <%Dingus_Tickler> evade
[1:21:48] <birchpeninsula> gotcha
[1:21:49] <TyrantBelial> Well
[1:21:51] <TyrantBelial> problem is
[1:21:52] <TyrantBelial> fuck element
[1:21:54] <tkoham> paolomu the reskinned wyvern skeleton
[1:21:55] <TyrantBelial> it's worthless in this game
[1:21:56] <birchpeninsula> thanks chat
[1:22:02] <+NWR_James> I wish you could pop Paolumu if you hit it
[1:22:03] <+Tokanova> it's an infinite combo yeah
[1:22:03] <drfaustisdead> The mounting discharge is the only one worth a damn.
[1:22:03] <HentaiSpyder> i wish you could cut its damn tail.
[1:22:06] <+RCtiger0> @SergeEXE Oh I see. Guess I read some bad source
[1:22:08] <+Lilrich535> Elmo is killing it
[1:22:08] <carlsomanriquez> does it preppel itself when it gets inflated?
[1:22:10] <HUNTERX2X> nope
[1:22:10] <thewhiterice92> Has Pat seen the Crap guides?
[1:22:13] <htromak> PC version launches with weapon balance and QoL updates, so return to gathering hub and the HH buffs
[1:22:14] <%Dingus_Tickler> @tyrantbelial Barroth SA Max wants to have a word with you
[1:22:19] <wolfen091> is greatsword loser pat back at it again
[1:22:19] <HUNTERX2X> that wasn't a very good advice but its fine
[1:22:20] <grayjammer> I know nothing about monhun other than the fact that paolumu is an absolute cutie
[1:22:21] <TyrantBelial> I know I use that
[1:22:26] <+Tokanova> i think its better to do the cool rising combo thing since it gets you full meter
[1:22:27] <Prism_Wing> WTF us that awful creature??
[1:22:31] <htromak> all the content updates like new monsters and collaboration events will be delayed though
[1:22:33] <element_of_loyalty> *Times Up*
[1:22:34] <TyrantBelial> it's the best swicth axce
[1:22:35] <+Xanezz> does the pc version not have ds4 symbols?
[1:22:36] <KatabolicRage> maybe my hate for him is because I use sword and shield which is comparatively short ranged but I hate this guy when he flies
[1:22:38] <+Xanezz> thats a shame
[1:22:39] <TyrantBelial> it's way better to just do X-A
[1:22:40] <TyrantBelial> for DPS
[1:22:45] <AncelDeLambert> that there's a balloon bat
[1:22:45] <%Remery_> @Tokanova yea until you see it enter a Turf War
[1:22:45] <%Dingus_Tickler> @tyrantbelial But yeah, for Axe of Demons Elementless I never use Discharge
[1:22:50] <+SergeEXE> Axe Chops BEST Chops
[1:22:51] <%ScottishMadJacko> but fun tho
[1:22:52] <tkoham> @Prism_Wing Paolomu or what the old heads call the "nutte batte"

[1:24:08] <%RittiFruity> Pat got flashed ( ͡° ͜ʖ ͡°)
[1:24:15] <%MisterCrimson> I've been workshopping a weapon idea. Shield Gauntlets. They're big old shields, but you punch with them and they use bullets like the gunlance for big smashes
[1:24:16] <%CitrusDrink> If you had some cool sunglasses on this neva woulda happened
[1:24:16] <Daxalog> moo mooves
[1:24:21] <element_of_loyalty> AH HAH
[1:24:21] <Sarumarine> Like Odogaron, Tzi doesn't give a shit about anything
[1:24:22] <+NiktenKing> Tzi-Tzi is cool... he gives you Wesker-ish sunglasses
[1:24:24] <TyrantBelial> Also, I also don't do discharges, cus mounts end in a discharge
[1:24:24] <%Remery_> I love that guy, he's just a little raptor with flash bangs on his head apatElmo
[1:24:24] <+NWR_James> CRAZY TALK

[1:24:32] <SummonerMagno> map is still red
[1:24:32] <element_of_loyalty> PAT THE LIAR
[1:24:39] <TyrantBelial> So the first mount is a guarenteed paralyze anyways
[1:24:45] <%Soulbishop> Pat can you move your hands closer to the camera
[1:24:46] <$Dutchpotato> Isn’t that literally a weapon in rwby @mistercrimson
[1:24:49] <Thunderhawk47> Are any of the bow weapons viable in solo?
[1:24:50] <%Dingus_Tickler> Tfw Capcom buffed SA mount Discharge to no longer use up Sharpness Kreygasm
[1:24:52] <Hydrapissed> !uptime
[1:24:52] <@Moobot> I've been playing this game for how long? Oh only 1h 24m 54s.

[1:25:18] <+Tokanova> THE MON STARS
[1:25:24] <+NWR_James> Hiii~
[1:25:27] <%MisterCrimson> @Dutchpotato I have no idea about anything in Rwby, I was thinking of Rhytatyn in FFXIV
[1:25:32] <+Sdeje> Elmo is the best Palico
[1:25:33] <%Soulbishop> Is that a modified over claw grip?
[1:25:33] <$Dutchpotato> Yeah ranged weapons in this game are solid
[1:25:34] <rainbowdreamking> A long time ago I heard there was supposed to be a hunting wolf and a boomerang as new weapons
[1:25:35] <Thunderhawk47> Thanks guys!
[1:25:37] <element_of_loyalty> Labron James is a Monstar
[1:25:41] <Hydrapissed> Flash bang em
[1:25:43] <%Dingus_Tickler> @angriestpat Do the Wild Swing into Morph Attack combo. It’s Circle -> R2, and one of the best SA attacks. Just try it out
[1:25:44] <NYCrownlessKing> PAT HOW DARE U touch this game early doodStare
[1:25:46] <SummonerMagno> i just use my bow or LBG
[1:25:48] <Endlesslyforgetful> but its adorbs
[1:25:52] <garbageheaphound> there is in fact not a switchaxe in RWBY
[1:25:53] <Hydrapissed> just grow the flash bangs and slam him on the ground
[1:25:53] <JohnHP> Hey everyone :) How many times as Pat fucked up so far?
[1:25:53] <+Tokanova> legiana's armor is so pretty
[1:25:54] <+tehpatmarsons> maybe you should try a ranged weapon then :) @AngriestPat
[1:25:54] <Daxalog> Must be easier for ranged characters
[1:25:55] <turbulentstriker> Anything with a Rathian skeleton is always a hassle.
[1:25:56] <+NiktenKing> Just spam flash
[1:25:57] <TyrantBelial> you have no big hits
[1:25:59] <+SergeEXE> Paolumu is easy if you use Fire Light Bowgun
[1:26:00] <KatabolicRage> not gonna catch him?
[1:26:02] <$Dutchpotato> Just use a bow :)
[1:26:03] <BakerBrute> last hit of discharge
[1:26:04] <+SergeEXE> like, REALLY easy
[1:26:04] <garbageheaphound> there is a hammer grenade launcher though
[1:26:08] <Hydrapissed> or get the flash fly cage for ur palico
[1:26:08] <TyrantBelial> You have NO big hits
[1:26:09] <BakerBrute> or the last hit of the axe spin
[1:26:11] <%Remery_> Yea usually I'm the Lance tanky guys in these types of games but MHW version of the Hunting Bow just drew me in.
[1:26:12] <TyrantBelial> it's the one thing S-A lacks
[1:26:21] <element_of_loyalty> BYE
[1:26:23] <KatabolicRage> annnnd he's gone
[1:26:23] <+SergeEXE> LUL
[1:26:25] <Hydrapissed> The big hit is the transform from the wild swing @AngriestPat
[1:26:26] <0rnan> CYA
[1:26:27] <%GummiBunnies> LUL
[1:26:27] <%Dingus_Tickler> Wild Swing -> Morph Attack’s 2nd Spin is the biggest hit

[1:31:40] <+SergeEXE> NO
[1:31:44] <+Aggro_Will> @AngriestPat If you need some sturdy bones is that why Paige isn't on the stream tonight?
[1:31:44] <element_of_loyalty> PUGB dance
[1:31:50] <Hydrapissed> runs great on beasts pc
[1:31:58] <tkoham> the official house pet tier list is: Dogs, large reptiles, fish, Pigs > possums, racoons, foxes, and domesticated game animals> small reptiles, rodents, Big beetles and spiders > ants > pet rocks > incontinent primates > cats
[1:31:59] <%Dingus_Tickler> When’s Battle Royale coming to Monster Hunter?
[1:31:59] <%mister___doctor> So Pat have you warmed up to the Handler yet
[1:32:01] <eyedol33> I'm sure this has come up a million times already but has it crashed at all for Pat?
[1:32:06] <+Crippl3> ***
[1:32:11] <+SergeEXE> I'm not getting PC version because I don't want to lose 300 hours of progress

[1:32:39] <%crot45> i have no idea if my laptop can run MHW or not
[1:32:41] <tkoham> @NWR_James clearly they'd be domesticated game animals
[1:32:47] <+sogeki_dan> @SergeEXE How many of the 300 is on a loading screen?
[1:32:51] <President_valentine> it's easier to capture than to kill
[1:32:53] <Hydrapissed> look up the specs crot
[1:32:53] <KatabolicRage> capturing the thing is arguably easier than killing it though pat
[1:32:57] <+OceanGovernor> Thank you Volta BlessRNG
[1:32:58] <+SergeEXE> @sogeki_dan lol
[1:33:00] <killenbigbugs> but whats time limit at now
[1:33:03] <Prevot> >goin up the stairs
[1:33:05] <Leebrownie> you said you'd show gathering hall, do it
[1:33:08] <Hydrapissed> 300 hours 150 hours of loading
[1:33:14] <tkoham> !uptime
[1:33:15] <@Moobot> I've been playing this game for how long? Oh only 1h 33m 16s.
[1:33:18] <%hatesdps> @angriestpat and i have no idea how to join your dumb discord wheres that fucking info
[1:33:22] <gooeychild> im jesus
[1:33:32] <+SergeEXE> I'm also only running a 970 with a 4790k
[1:33:34] <+JasperIzHere> Remember when developers put out benchmark tools?
[1:33:34] <mercado94> jesus
[1:33:35] <LORDSPOOKLEKINS> GREAT
[1:33:37] <+SergeEXE> I don't trust those specs to run well
[1:33:41] <Psyramics> it was always like that
[1:33:41] <+Areus> slugZUCC
[1:33:42] <+tehpatmarsons> list was fine before??
[1:33:43] <+terry_quest> its not that bad on ps4
[1:33:43] <+Mr_FruitzNutz> wasn't it instant on the console also???
[1:33:43] <Prevot> It's the same as the PS4 pat
[1:33:44] <+NiktenKing> The lift was normally instant?
[1:33:47] <gooeychild> @AngriestPat So Pat, is it true?
[1:33:52] <+terry_quest> only if you go into the hub and out
[1:33:52] <Psyramics> the only load time on the lift was to the gathering hub
[1:33:54] <+NiktenKing> Who actually had loads on lifts?
[1:33:57] <SummonerMagno> isnt capture easier than regular kill??
[1:34:00] <+SergeEXE> Pat's CRAZY TALK
[1:34:02] <$Dutchpotato> It was faster on ps4 already
[1:34:05] <%Soulbishop> Is there a free hunt mode in MH?
[1:34:08] <tkoham> @SergeEXE jsut turn off lighting reflections and HBAO/MSAA and you can do 10880 high prolly
[1:34:13] <Leebrownie> gathering hub
[1:34:14] <KatabolicRage> aw ye, sword and shield
[1:34:14] <+OblivionSword1> Pat about squad ?
[1:34:16] <GamerWorlock> load was only for gathering hub
[1:34:18] <%Ninestempest> YEAH S&S YEA
[1:34:19] <element_of_loyalty> Famously
[1:34:21] <5hady_> are those pre made load outs?
[1:34:22] <vingadivo> that armor set is sick
[1:34:24] <%Unlimited_> sword and shield let's goo
[1:34:24] <Hydrapissed> How long u got for pc pat 3 hours @AngriestPat ??¿
[1:34:24] <+SergeEXE> S&S THE BESTTTTTTTTTTT
[1:34:26] <KatabolicRage> sword and shield is great, it can vault up into the air for mounts, do bashing, do slashing
[1:34:30] <AncelDeLambert> I'm gonna have to rewatch Pat coaching Woolie at this before the week is out, clearly
[1:34:31] <ZizerX> Squads pat
[1:34:33] <KatabolicRage> and if you get a paralyze knife it's HILAIRIOUS
[1:34:34] <+Mr_FruitzNutz> damn that load time tho
[1:34:34] <President_valentine> Use the bow
[1:34:38] <+Mr_FruitzNutz> sheesh that was quick
[1:34:40] <ScrapSentinel> @Soulbishop like going out into the overworld without a quest? yes.
[1:34:42] <+SergeEXE> that load time is damn attractive
[1:34:44] <+SergeEXE> I have to admit
[1:34:47] <element_of_loyalty> Tee Pee
[1:34:47] <beatie_g> Famously neglected
[1:34:49] <JamesDragon> no stay with the switch axe
[1:34:51] <+sogeki_dan> Use a ranged weapon! baka
[1:34:54] <vingadivo> sword and shield is for babies afraid of getting mauled by giant beasts
[1:34:57] <+terry_quest> will behemoth be in the game on launch?
[1:35:01] <AncelDeLambert> New wife and kids better than the old wife and kids
[1:35:06] <+tehpatmarsons> grinding for rare pets and fish is gonna be soooooo much easier on PC
[1:35:06] <+SergeEXE> @terry_quest No :(
[1:35:09] <+terry_quest> im still struggling with pugs
[1:35:11] <$Dutchpotato> No behemoth on launch
[1:35:11] <LORDSPOOKLEKINS> That was like a second.
[1:35:12] <+terry_quest> on ps4
[1:35:18] <Hydrapissed> cause its like 40 secodns every damn time
[1:35:19] <WackyXmand> A tip from a S&S pro. Shoryuken everything!
[1:35:21] <Hydrapissed> its brutal
[1:35:28] <Hydrapissed> 300 hours of play time =150 hours of load time
[1:35:29] <element_of_loyalty> Hey blockhead
[1:35:32] <+SergeEXE> Pat, Backstep!
[1:35:35] <AncelDeLambert> why tf is the shield in his RIGHT hand?
[1:35:35] <President_valentine> dunk on him
[1:35:44] <Prevot> man fuck investigation farming
[1:35:45] <%drabberfaun535> what is that rock monster?
[1:35:45] <Hydrapissed> The hunters are left handed
[1:35:54] <Hydrapissed> all of em
[1:35:55] <Max_Capacity> thats a tiny barroth
[1:35:55] <President_valentine> charge the backslash
[1:35:55] <+Revets315> I love this song
[1:35:56] <AncelDeLambert> that's wierd
[1:36:03] <+philosopher721> he's a mud puppy
[1:36:07] <KatabolicRage> oh no not the goo
[1:36:07] <Hydrapissed> right handed people died in the monster wars btw
[1:36:08] <DesuDesuDokiDoki> gooed
[1:36:09] <tkoham> > fights rath with hammer and then fights barroth with sword and board
[1:36:09] <Sarumarine> gettin' goo'd
[1:36:09] <element_of_loyalty> GAK GAK GAK
[1:36:10] <+terry_quest> whats weird about beeing a lefty ??
[1:36:10] <+philosopher721> not a rock monster
[1:36:12] <%ScottishMadJacko> yeah!
[1:36:14] <%Ninestempest> the sword and shield are in opposite hands so they can justify using items while having the weapon out
[1:36:15] <WackyXmand> block and use items @AngriestPat
[1:36:15] <0rond> @AngriestPat what about all the limited time promotions? will i be able to get the dante set and weapons on PC?
[1:36:16] <IBeastmanNinjaI1> Woolie goo
[1:36:16] <$Mendin> Is it b lack and evil?
[1:36:19] <+SergeEXE> Charge Slash with Sword for Mounts!
[1:36:22] <$mandragoraroot> icky pooey
[1:36:22] <+terry_quest> im a lefty cmonBruh
[1:36:22] <%Ninestempest> S&S can just drink pots and do wahtever even with weapons unsheathed
[1:36:24] <+NiktenKing> I don't even mind frame rate quality. HIgher frame rate on the monsters and player animations make it look somewhat weightless and not impactful. The main appeal of the port for me now is how squads and loads work.
[1:36:25] <Smithy4224> @drabberfaun535 Rock lobster here is called Barroth. He flings mud like a wet puppy, which is irksome.
[1:36:25] <tkoham> get gooped
[1:36:26] <+bonzosan> the hero of time is left handed
[1:36:26] <Qashti> the load times on ps4 are fine
[1:36:28] <vingadivo> whats even the point of bashing a moster with that tiny tiny baby shield?
[1:36:28] <KatabolicRage> I actually think the excuse they give is that hunters like to block with their dominant hand
[1:36:29] <beatie_g> Apparently sns users irl would have the swords the same way
[1:36:30] <tkoham> get absolutely slimed on
[1:36:36] <+Mikatonic> Sick mobility
[1:36:38] <AncelDeLambert> Link is one dude, this is a guild of hunters
[1:36:39] <+SergeEXE> @vingadivo causes KO if done on head
[1:36:41] <element_of_loyalty> Smooze
[1:36:42] <%Jpdodds> @Hydrapissed The wield the 2handed weapons like righties though. IIRC in lore is the wear the shield on the dominate hand to prioritize defense
[1:36:46] <Soul_Intern> black evil
[1:36:48] <Soul_Intern> goo
[1:36:50] <%Ninestempest> @vingadivo still does KO, and you can do liek a 3 hit shield combo
[1:36:51] <+SergeEXE> YEYEYEYEYE
[1:36:51] <$Mendin> excuse me his name is Zelda
[1:36:56] <+terry_quest> @vingadivo you can stun monsters with it
[1:36:57] <+SergeEXE> MOST VERSATILE WEAPON
[1:36:59] <beatie_g> Probably to use the shields affectively
[1:37:03] <element_of_loyalty> Beragon
[1:37:10] <EMP_Ike_Turner> rip and tear
[1:37:11] <Hydrapissed> @Jpdodds yeah thats prob the real reason I just wana think all the righties died for some reason
[1:37:16] <%Ninestempest> I fucking love beating a monster's head up with the shield
[1:37:16] <KatabolicRage> it really is, it can do a bit of everything, if you get a good sword with paralyze on it you'll procc it a lot too
[1:37:26] <+Raeiyn> how'd we get the early access
[1:37:30] <%Ninestempest> S&S and DB are amazing status weapons
[1:37:36] <tkoham> dagger : sleep sns: para
[1:37:38] <Hydrapissed> they been giving pc test to people lately
[1:37:41] <+SergeEXE> I love SnS
[1:37:42] <+Dioliciouss> I used to rag on how basic playing S&S feels but after using it, it's simple but soooo effective
[1:37:49] <beatie_g> Everyone knows it’s hi raw or go home
[1:37:51] <+SergeEXE> Although Generations/GU SnS are BEST because of Oils
[1:37:55] <element_of_loyalty> PWN
[1:38:01] <+tehpatmarsons> close
[1:38:02] <%Ninestempest> I fucking LOVE the oils in S&S
[1:38:04] <xeros720> I really miss all the neat weapon oils it had in generations
[1:38:06] <%CitrusDrink> I wish there were more good sleep DBs in the game
[1:38:09] <%Ninestempest> I miss that gens shit :(
[1:38:10] <drfaustisdead> points for almost stylish character action.
[1:38:12] <+Nomicro4u> IS THAT ELMO I HEAR
[1:38:14] <+kuervojones> I heard a meow
[1:38:14] <+SergeEXE> Oils made SnS BUSTED
[1:38:23] <vingadivo> i like the mobility but i hate the weapon itself
[1:38:23] <element_of_loyalty> Elmo is in the machine
[1:38:23] <tkoham> @beatie_g only on weapons with a low attacks/minute
[1:38:30] <beatie_g> The oils are the only thin I really liked about generations tbqh
[1:38:39] <+Nomicro4u> HE CRY FOR LÖÖPS
[1:38:41] <tkoham> SnS is the shoto character of this game
[1:38:45] <%CitrusDrink> Has he used his mantle once yet?
[1:38:46] <+mrducksauce> How are these fuckers playing this already?
[1:38:48] <%Ninestempest> Sword and Shield Mobility 🤔
[1:38:51] <element_of_loyalty> wiggle
[1:38:53] <+mrducksauce> I want to play it
[1:38:54] <LORDSPOOKLEKINS> Is that new?I've literally never seen that jumping move
[1:38:54] <vingadivo> what?
[1:38:57] <+LastHazzerd> you mean it's not charge blade mobility?
[1:38:59] <KatabolicRage> I used to love charge blade but SnS is just too nice
[1:39:00] <+kuervojones> Meowdy-do!
[1:39:04] <beatie_g> Crazy talk?
[1:39:06] <tkoham> SnS: ryu DB: Ken
[1:39:06] <hntronium> They asked for copies
[1:39:09] <%Ninestempest> @mrducksauce beg capcom
[1:39:15] <$Dutchpotato> Sword shield mobility with sword and shield PogChamp
[1:39:16] <+SergeEXE> @LORDSPOOKLEKINS Sort of. The backhop is not new, but the hop up is
[1:39:22] <%DedlokPM> GIVE PALICO ELMO THE LOOPS, PAT
[1:39:24] <+mrducksauce> @Ninestempest Fuck CAPCOM
[1:39:38] <vingadivo> no shit pat
[1:39:42] <element_of_loyalty> Foothead
[1:39:47] <LORDSPOOKLEKINS> @SergeEXE yeah okay.That's what I figured.
[1:39:51] <+bonzosan> i kinda like how the SnS feels more like a weapon from Dragon's Dogma
[1:39:58] <+terry_quest> so i never tried plug in my ps4 controller on pc does it just work with the game or do i need a programm ?
[1:40:06] <b1gboss007> can you transfer your save data from ps4 to pc ?
[1:40:08] <+LastHazzerd> charge blade
[1:40:15] <$Dutchpotato> No save transfer
[1:40:20] <+terry_quest> @b1gboss007 you cant
[1:40:20] <+kuervojones> Charge blade or switch axe?
[1:40:23] <ScrapSentinel> why block when you can tackle
[1:40:24] <+SergeEXE> @LORDSPOOKLEKINS it's an extension of the 2 Attack Buttons to attack forward and jump up ledges and shit
[1:40:25] <GrayMatterMiner> which is sad
[1:40:27] <+mrducksauce> @b1gboss007 Yes you can......NO, are you stupid?
[1:40:34] <vingadivo> lore wise whats even the point of having a shield against these things
[1:40:38] <+CJett92> DRAGONATE!!
[1:40:42] <+SergeEXE> WHERE'S MY DRAGONATOR
[1:40:47] <GrayMatterMiner> to be a sick badass
[1:40:47] <beatie_g> Personally I think that starting fresh on pc sounds kinda fun
[1:40:48] <KatabolicRage> the ability to move while your attacking is pretty major, the animation lock used to be a lot more
[1:40:48] <$Mendin> @terry_quest I think you can but you might have to enable big picture
[1:40:51] <%CitrusDrink> FLIP THE SWITCH
[1:40:54] <+kuervojones> @AngriestPat What is the best weapon and why is it the Hunting Horn?
[1:40:56] <%MaiHusbando9S> D R A G O N A T O R
[1:40:58] <$Mendin> Shields are good but not if they engender passivity
[1:41:00] <President_valentine> pull the lever kronk
[1:41:00] <+SergeEXE> DRAGONATORRRRRRRRRRRRR
[1:41:01] <%Remery_> Sounds too close to the Baconator

[1:41:09] <+CJett92> D R A G O N A T E A B I T C H
[1:41:11] <KatabolicRage> eh, SnS blocking is really only for emergencies
[1:41:11] <+tehpatmarsons> gotta keep screaming
[1:41:12] <+Raeiyn> is there a way to get early access or is that just for guys like pat and max
[1:41:12] <%LymanAl> DRAGONATOR

[1:48:28] <+Mikatonic> @Smithy4224 yeppers
[1:48:30] <+tehpatmarsons> ah yes, the one lance combo LUL
[1:48:32] <+SergeEXE> It's a Bird Wyvern, so
[1:48:35] <%shin_garbage> Holy shit Pat isnt using greatsword? what timeline is this?
[1:48:47] <element_of_loyalty> anal probe
[1:48:53] <Psyramics> > no counterthrust come on pat
[1:48:56] <President_valentine> use the counter thrust
[1:48:57] <+Fenlig> There are so many cool things about this game, but I cannot get over the ridiculious weapon designs
[1:48:59] <Smithy4224> The only lance combo you need: Stab, block, rinse, repeat.
[1:49:08] <TerraWraith> @Crippl3 The major differences of the shock and pitfall traps are based on the monsters you fight. if a monster can hover or fly, it might fly out of a pitfall, if it's super resistant to electricity, it can shake out of shock traps faster.
[1:49:11] <RadicalWeegee> Hype for MON HUN PC
[1:49:12] <+SergeEXE> timing was off
[1:49:19] <rasamune> The weapons are great
[1:49:24] <vingadivo> the more ridiculous the better
[1:49:42] <+Crippl3> @TerraWraith yo thanks
[1:49:45] <element_of_loyalty> twerp
[1:49:47] <Smithy4224> We haven't even touched on the machine guns in this game. brownLUL
[1:49:49] <+Crippl3> and thanks to everyone else who answered
[1:49:49] <+Mikatonic> tzitzi confirmed counter to lance
[1:49:54] <President_valentine> dumb looking weapons are the beest
[1:50:10] <+Fenlig> I dunno, i look at that lance and you can figure how much it would weight, and thats a normal human, totally break any sort of immersion for me.
[1:50:16] <ahmenthi> i want the sharq lance to come back
[1:50:21] <KnightAsteran> ..... can CB block that too? if so i hate myself
[1:50:22] <element_of_loyalty> meow

[1:50:31] <element_of_loyalty> LUL
[1:50:34] <suikudo> LUL
[1:50:35] <vingadivo> just think about how humans had to evolve their weapons to be able to fight these giant monsters and it all makes sense
[1:50:38] <+SKO0TZ> hunters are mutants lore wise
[1:50:40] <+EmiinV> i mean how did that break your immersion and not the walking talking cats with weapons
[1:50:40] <ChatNinja> You fool
[1:50:41] <xeros720> it's already been confirmed that Hunters are weird superhumans anyways
[1:50:44] <rasamune> The weapons are that big so you can tell what your partners are wielding from a million miles away
[1:50:45] <%Jpdodds> @Fenlig But the giant monsters wouldn't "break immersion".
[1:50:51] <pwnhills> I mean, hunters are clearly some form of meta-hman
[1:50:51] <%Remery_> I hate fighting tzi tzi because once you damage those ears, he still tries to use it but nothing comes out. It looks so pathetic because other than that he's just a blue raptor. :(
[1:50:55] <Smithy4224> @fenlig These guys are fighting flashbang raptors and giant dragons. I just threw realism out the window immediately.
[1:50:58] <MyDarkStorm> Show is Behemoth In the PC Version
[1:51:06] <element_of_loyalty> KA BLAM
[1:51:14] <MyDarkStorm> So is Behemoth In the PC Version
[1:51:16] <rasamune> And so you can see the hitboxes of your own attacks, of course
[1:51:20] <%CitrusDrink> Don't think so

[1:51:31] <DesuDesuDokiDoki> sounds like a chicken
[1:51:35] <%Jpdodds> No behemoth yet, guys. The game isnt even fully out
[1:51:36] <Kain5707> just Vanilla game
[1:51:39] <%hatesdps> HOW DO I JOIN THE DISCORD YOU FUCKS
[1:51:39] <element_of_loyalty> oral stab
[1:51:44] <%shin_garbage> No, the PC version of MonHun is essentially at 1.0 of the PS4 version
[1:51:45] <+Fenlig> No giant monsters have existed and the move and sound like heavy animals.
[1:51:46] <TerraWraith> @MyDarkStorm I highly doubt it. PC is probably going to be vanilla for a little while.
[1:51:53] <%Remery_> droppy ears

[1:52:58] <%shin_garbage> Yeah
[1:53:01] <Greywyn00> did he already fight behemoth?
[1:53:02] <Sloavon> Paige is pregnant
[1:53:02] <rasamune> They have their own cat language that you can understand
[1:53:03] <+EmiinV> immersion has been thrown way out the window
[1:53:10] <%DedlokPM> @vingadivo One is a chef in town, so yes
[1:53:12] <KnightAsteran> @vingadivo there are multiple cat languages in this
[1:53:13] <%Jpdodds> @Fenlig No giant monsters have existed? In real life? Like a dinosaur? Monsters in this game are massive, man, I'm talking living volcanos. If it helps, the hunters are superhuman
[1:53:14] <%shin_garbage> they speak in weird cat puns
[1:53:15] <element_of_loyalty> LIMP

[1:55:18] <+tehpatmarsons> behemoth soloing = RNG cannon builds
[1:55:24] <ahmenthi> if you're good at spamming carpet bombs with a bowgun, he's solo-able
[1:55:25] <IntrepidEye> Its doable solo but hard and a little tedious because of how long it is
[1:55:31] <element_of_loyalty> DEATH
[1:55:36] <ScrapSentinel> @Greywyn00 he has multiplayer health in singleplayer, so you just gotta be good at the game i guess
[1:55:37] <+terry_quest> @Greywyn00 gotta be perfect with every move
[1:55:37] <%shin_garbage> also, why are Pats prompts xbox controller promps when he's using a PS4 pad

[2:04:09] <BlueSpartan119> I see why Woolie needed larger text size
[2:04:09] <DartonLance> so monster hunter world 3ds confirmed?
[2:04:09] <TerraWraith> This does look like a 3ds port of MH.
[2:04:11] <element_of_loyalty> I NEED MY GLASSES
[2:04:12] <+Rshiners> i feel a weird nostalgia for the 3ds version
[2:04:14] <JeromeX23> When you take the retro vision pill in Isaac...
[2:04:15] <suikudo> Literally a 3ds game
[2:04:15] <+bonzosan> Now we know what this game looks like in the OTHER timeline.
[2:04:15] <+ItsAGundamu> 10000 fps thoug
[2:04:17] <Smithy4224> Off to Rotten Vale, where settings go to die.
[2:04:18] <+yeeyeyee> this actually looks better without my glasses on

[2:04:18] <+ChronoBirb> Look at that frame rate tho
[2:04:19] <suikudo> LITERALLLY
[2:04:20] <Sloavon> Holy shit
[2:04:21] <+ChronoBirb> very smooth
[2:04:22] <+Dioliciouss> surprpsingly low quality 3d models
[2:04:22] <cizal11> what about low settings at a less ridiculous resolution tho
[2:04:22] <MrBinkley> Is the frame rate capped?
[2:04:23] <+Worldbrand> wow that lighting is TRYING

[2:05:40] <Innocuous_Goat> High quality 60 FPS handheld graphics
[2:05:41] <CookieCutter007> fuck you handler
[2:05:41] <TerraWraith> "If all else fails, use fire!"
[2:05:42] <tkoham> exchited to see random monsters popping in 3 feet away
[2:05:43] <+Mikatonic> that line never gets less horrifying
[2:05:45] <+yeeyeyee> @AngriestPat why are you streaming during evo you madman
[2:05:45] <%MaiHusbando9S> ITS JUST ILLEGIBLE

[2:05:52] <+McSnazzyPants> wow it's like i'm really playing on a 3ds! Kappa
[2:05:53] <+Bupkis7> I didn't know that was Pat for a second because his character is so generic
[2:05:55] <SubliminaIMessages> Now do your job so the handler can stuff her fuckin face
[2:05:55] <+ItsAGundamu> I CANT READ THE MENU
[2:05:57] <+SKO0TZ> heheheheh
[2:05:57] <vingadivo> but that framerate tho
[2:05:57] <@SSaryn> That text is genuinely unreadable...

[2:05:58] <Dude9O15> Does the online run well on this?
[2:05:58] <rasamune> Jesus that is really unreadable
[2:05:59] <BlueSpartan119> @buttdirt LUL
[2:06:00] <blonde7000> My god
[2:06:01] <+Dioliciouss> I mean doesn't this just give the 3DS games credit for looking ok?
[2:06:01] <turbomuffin89> My eyes
[2:06:02] <+Superstarsage> Whooph
[2:06:04] <Vyctorian> This looks like blight town
[2:06:04] <Hydrapissed> 3ds on a 90 inch monitor
[2:06:04] <B1G_DADDY_ADAM> whats wrong with the game?
[2:06:05] <+bonzosan> fire works well, arison.
[2:06:05] <mercado94> @AngriestPat Turn on the fog

[2:06:08] <+Debauchery_Man> you kids dont know how good you got it, this is nostalgic
[2:06:09] <+Tonku_the_Red> Can't wait for Pat to vehemently vomit from this low spec Monster Hunter.
[2:06:10] <cizal11> this wouldn't even be that awful if the text weren't affected so badly
[2:06:12] <waifoong98> Whats with the resolution?!?
[2:06:13] <+MisterMusashi> wtf is thiiiiiiis

[2:06:15] <KuroTendouSouji> @angriestpat ugly bitches get hotter when they're low-res
[2:06:15] <$i_am_therydon> god i hate handler. except in her butterfly outfit. as long as she's not talking tho.
[2:06:15] <HentaiSpyder> the Handler is JUST NOT the Guildmarm.
[2:06:18] <%RittiFruity> Best soundstrack zone in the game.
[2:06:18] <%mister___doctor> Turn on the fog!
[2:06:18] <Smithy4224> How can we sight anything in this blur?

[2:06:30] <Max_Capacity> I SAW Z-FIGHTING
[2:06:31] <blonde7000> IS the PC version really this bad
[2:06:33] <SuperNotSuspiciousMan> Fix the unreadableness and just slap this as "3DS Mode" in settings
[2:06:33] <%MisterCrimson> This looks less like low settings and more like a shit filter over the normal game
[2:06:34] <Minorou> We have to go deeper
[2:06:34] <DesuDesuDokiDoki> oh no
[2:06:35] <%MaiHusbando9S> pat no

[2:06:41] <Greywyn00> I love how it literally looks like a 3ds game
[2:06:41] <BakerBrute> I love rotton vale, but the zone has the least monsters in it
[2:06:42] <+MisterMusashi> Wait why is he res so low?
[2:06:42] <+Sdeje> It did have a 640X480
[2:06:43] <+Rorinator> Stop this
[2:06:43] <%SneakyPenguin77> there was a 640 option @AngriestPat
[2:06:44] <Graxe_> Just put this on the Switch.
[2:06:45] <%electrokev007> wait wtf? how is he already at that point in the game?

[2:11:29] <suikudo> I cant believe he is actualyl playing it like this
[2:11:33] <ScrapSentinel> hornetaur ATTAC

[2:11:43] <+cereal_box_conspiracy> I don't think that's dithering, but I'm also not 100% sure what Pat is talking about.
[2:11:44] <ErikQRoks> this will probably be how i run the game. that dank $200 PC life
[2:11:45] <+Dioliciouss> That dithering probably looks way better at 1080+
[2:11:46] <element_of_loyalty> so fuckin bad
[2:11:46] <+gollum80> xbone version of MHW lookin good LUL

[2:12:00] <+Worldbrand> oh my god
[2:12:06] <+cereal_box_conspiracy> Dithering is when you, say, alternate between black and white to create a grey color.
[2:12:08] <+Tonku_the_Red> Title the video "Monster Hunter World 3DS PORT!?!?!?!"
[2:12:09] <cizal11> no pat
[2:12:10] <deviljhojho94> Exclusive switch handheld footage
[2:12:11] <rasamune> The 3DS would never be able to run this at 60 fps

[2:12:22] <%CitrusDrink> DIG UP, STUPID
[2:12:25] <+dansinginthestreet> There's patterns of dark pixels appearing at the bottom edge, I assume because of a vignette
[2:12:25] <IBeastmanNinjaI1> How are you liking the PC version?@AngriestPat
[2:12:29] <+dansinginthestreet> which would be dithering
[2:12:30] <+terry_quest> he was so close to the cutscene trigger
[2:12:30] <element_of_loyalty> HOW CAN THIS BE
[2:12:31] <vingadivo> NICE

[2:15:41] <+Vroom0> Cats are liquids
[2:15:42] <VritraReiRei> @AngriestPat you should change the screen layout so that the game footage emulates the top screen of a 3DS and your Cam as the bottom of the 3DS screen
[2:15:44] <%THATGUY_789> so when they fight damage is at a minnium
[2:15:47] <+Dasbubba> @chatninja nah. A lot of the first fleet are just old. I think the commander is from the first fleet if I remember correctly.
[2:15:47] <+MagpieHorde> protects their vital bits
[2:15:48] <dsauce999> 1998 goty

[2:34:41] <+NiktenKing> It looks better than a DS screen
[2:34:41] <JustGinja> It's only gonna be 1080p for the stream tho no?
[2:34:43] <Soul_Intern> STREAM RESTORED
[2:34:43] <+ahdurian> that doesnt look that bad

[2:34:49] <+Crippl3> there's some weird anti-aliasing
[2:34:49] <%MisterCrimson> I bet it does look good, shame we can only see 720
[2:34:50] <+Worldbrand> Even when you had it super low earlier, the lighting engine was still in there and I still saw normals/specular maps
[2:34:52] <BlueSpartan119> "pretty good"
[2:34:53] <ErikQRoks> i'm still looking forward to my 720x480 lowest experience :3

[2:40:28] <nannerpuss2961> can you change the button prompts to playstation buttons?
[2:40:28] <element_of_loyalty> Skeleton Warriors ball
[2:40:30] <tkoham> is this ner gigante and angry pckles lovechild
[2:40:32] <OkamiDude15> of course pat would take the bow to deprive mat from using it as sheva woopsBaka
[2:40:33] <Prevot> let me drink the radobaan bone juice
[2:40:34] <%electrokev007> @tlgtijeyfollower Away esti continue comme sa
[2:40:39] <%mister___doctor> More like Radobitch amiright boys
[2:40:41] <AncelDeLambert> just shooting the Dragonslayer's bow like it's a children's model
[2:40:43] <%Jpdodds> @morcego_cinzento The Dragonslayer Greatbow in DS still takes the cake
[2:40:47] <tlgtijeyfollower> 👍
[2:40:51] <%shin_garbage> Bowguns are for big cowards
[2:40:56] <element_of_loyalty> SONIC
[2:40:58] <%Remery_> When the monster starts the fly who do you call/ :D
[2:40:58] <+tehpatmarsons> ammo isnt hard
[2:40:59] <waifoong98> tbf bow has melee
[2:41:02] <cizal11> dragon piercer tho
[2:41:02] <Soul_Intern> An Pat is HUGE
[2:41:03] <%Gogogolem> @craig_t The gun is the weapon of the bitch.
[2:41:06] <%MisterCrimson> yes, Patrick, you have to aim a bow for it to work
[2:41:10] <Prevot> I hate all MH ranged weapons
[2:41:12] <+larrytron> Dragon piercer the tail when he falls over
[2:41:12] <Huunia> What GPU are you using?
[2:41:13] <President_valentine> Bows work best when your using the elemental weakness
[2:41:14] <Ell1ot> can you sharpen your bow?
[2:41:20] <%shin_garbage> no
[2:41:21] <%Remery_> Nope
[2:41:23] <Greywyn00> pat is allergic to dragon piercer
[2:41:26] <+OctaivianRex> More dragon piercer
[2:41:26] <%RittiFruity> Bow have more "gameplay" stuff compare to bow guns
[2:41:26] <element_of_loyalty> Resen up your bow
[2:41:30] <OkamiDude15> bow dont got a sharpness meter
[2:41:32] <AncelDeLambert> it has a scatterbomb feature?
[2:41:33] <%Remery_> Easy for mounting
[2:41:35] <%craig_t> @Gogogolem what about throwing weapons? or weird shit like blowdarts?
[2:41:36] <+NiktenKing> PAT JUST DODGE MELEE INSTEAD OF JUST DODGING FOR MOUNTING
[2:41:38] <+tehpatmarsons> people dont know what spread 3 kulve glutton can do LUL
[2:41:42] <morcego_cinzento> @Jpdodds i say that so far from what i see, both have their specific pros and cons
[2:41:43] <AncelDeLambert> bow mounted cherrybombs
[2:41:44] <element_of_loyalty> CHEAT
[2:41:50] <%shin_garbage> Close range coating is some ass
[2:41:50] <bearwagon> you can basically play bow like the old GS with dragon piercer, unless they nerfed it since last i played
[2:41:52] <+Miwavi> i never could get used to the bow
[2:41:53] <%keksisblyat> Guns are for C O W A R D S, brother’s a bow gun user so had to say it.
[2:41:55] <+Miwavi> you make it look so easy!
[2:42:02] <Innocuous_Goat> The range he says, "Out of Range"
[2:42:10] <element_of_loyalty> Bye
[2:42:10] <+HelloImTom08> the cons to bow is getting oneshot by everything in HR
[2:42:11] <+Dasbubba> @bearwagon nah. Pierced is still amazing.
[2:42:17] <vingadivo> ranged weapons are for cowarda
[2:42:18] <AncelDeLambert> bony boi
[2:42:26] <%Jpdodds> MORE BONES FOR HENRY JONES
[2:42:29] <AncelDeLambert> funny how the coward lives
[2:42:36] <SuperNotSuspiciousMan> thta's not how bones work-
[2:42:39] <element_of_loyalty> DEM BONES
[2:42:40] <Soul_Intern> The coward always lives
[2:42:40] <+gralho> do you like apples?
[2:42:45] <morcego_cinzento> All the healing Church hunter made fun of Simon for using a bow. But look at how good it is!
[2:42:47] <+Sdeje> Dragonpierce him lol
[2:42:50] <duel_pro> Does hes know how to mount monsters with the bow?
[2:42:51] <OkamiDude15> not the weird ball NotLikeThis
[2:42:56] <%CJett92> No one can stop Pat's wierd ball!!
[2:43:03] <cizal11> did pat forget about dragon piercer
[2:43:03] <element_of_loyalty> ARROW TO THE FACE
[2:43:05] <%mister___doctor> wow this monster is boned
[2:43:08] <AncelDeLambert> yeah, this game looks badass
[2:43:17] <+NiktenKing> He hasn't mount attacked it so far, so no?
[2:43:25] <Kadraxan> With a bow you can press R2 repeatedly to fire multiple shots that build in charge levels in the same time that it takes to charge a single max-level shot
[2:43:26] <AncelDeLambert> fuck you Capcom, stop stealing my money with your "good games"
[2:43:27] <$SGrim> Vaal is better in TAC. But coil binder is more DPS.
[2:43:32] <%D_day> Dragon Piercer is for chumps Kappa
[2:43:34] <vingadivo> bows are for cowards afraid of commitment
[2:43:37] <$mandragoraroot> oof
[2:43:38] <+NiktenKing> It's like one of the most free mount attack there is cause of how spammable it is
[2:43:42] <Cykaima> Hey pat! I bought Guilty Gear Rev2 even though I don't ever play fighters! Wish me luck
[2:43:53] <morcego_cinzento> Heya if i were to get Monster Hunter World. which plataform is more recommended? ps4 or a good pc?
[2:43:53] <$i_am_therydon> the pillars above you pat
[2:44:01] <Psyramics> A good PC
[2:44:03] <element_of_loyalty> rin the rutt
[2:44:12] <AncelDeLambert> omg it has the Cernos Prime scattershot
[2:44:12] <%GarbageNirvana> I'm Boney, I'm Boney, leave me aloney!
[2:44:15] <Innocuous_Goat> PS4 has more players, PC performs better
[2:44:15] <%Remery_> But Bow users are the ones mounting the monster the most
[2:44:16] <oAznoUta> "damn bony boy" was my nickname in middleschool
[2:44:19] <%THATGUY_789> he got a bone to pick with you..........sigh
[2:44:24] <AncelDeLambert> Pat is literally playing with the Cernos Prime right now
[2:44:32] <%Sora20030c> lmao
[2:44:34] <%Sora20030c> good point
[2:44:34] <+HelloImTom08> this is my fav monhun song Kreygasm

[2:44:44] <+Sdeje> Dash builds charge
[2:44:45] <element_of_loyalty> *Crazy Talk*
[2:44:47] <Abovebiggerbob> man i havent played this game in months. I should pick it up on pc

[2:45:05] <+templar010> I love bow
[2:45:14] <+Dasbubba> @
[2:45:17] <AncelDeLambert> those ones and twos are real depressing to watch. When we getting some NUMBERS in here?
[2:45:17] <CaptainJudaism> Dragon piercer comes from the dash and it is awesome.
[2:45:17] <element_of_loyalty> His fart?
[2:45:22] <+NiktenKing> Pat... seriously press Y after dodging
[2:45:23] <bearwagon> dude bow in mhw makes me feel like orlando bloom
[2:45:24] <President_valentine> Bow is love
[2:45:26] <%AbnormalVoid> really jostling his parts
[2:45:30] <element_of_loyalty> KAPOW
[2:45:36] <+Dasbubba> It gets you a full charged shot that is longer ranged and more focused than that follow up spread shot.
[2:45:36] <%Jpdodds> I bought the game in hopes of getting a pre load
[2:45:43] <cizal11> @AngriestPat triangle + circle you coward
[2:45:44] <$i_am_therydon> get that tail
[2:45:46] <+templar010> Pat you should try dragon piercer
[2:45:48] <+drewg91> I feel off MHW awhile back but this bow is awakening something in me
[2:45:48] <Soul_Intern> Pat has become Pat Bowie
[2:45:50] <%Sora20030c> I think preload will be day before
[2:45:55] <waifoong98> "footage of discount Dragon's Dogma strider"
[2:45:56] <%Remery_> Love Bow especially the mounting attack
[2:46:07] <+bonzosan> playing bows in 3u was rough to me
[2:46:10] <$i_am_therydon> mine his back
[2:46:11] <element_of_loyalty> Elmo git some
[2:46:21] <%Remery_> Can Palicos mount?
[2:46:28] <SulfurousAcid> Kirin big bitch energy
[2:46:30] <%Jpdodds> It has no damage tho
[2:46:31] <+SuichiTanaka> Dragon Piercer is great if you can set it up lengthwise
[2:46:32] <+Dasbubba> It’s fun that you can cut tails with the dragon piercer. Just firing at their face and out their back and blows their tail with it.
[2:46:34] <+HelloImTom08> kirin is pretty EZ with now
[2:46:36] <+HelloImTom08> bow
[2:46:36] <%SaltyDongs> That's a big black evil right there
[2:46:41] <%Remery_> Yea bow shits on Kirin side dodge his lightning bolts for days
[2:46:43] <deviljhojho94> GOTTA LET IT OUT
[2:46:51] <Soul_Intern> Big black boney evil
[2:46:52] <Quietshun13> I ike the ranged weapons but I don't wanna manage ammo
[2:46:53] <element_of_loyalty> Die Bones McCoy
[2:46:54] <President_valentine> just make sure it's a good fire bow
[2:46:55] <$SGrim> @Remery_ not in this game. In Generations and GU they can.
[2:46:56] <+Dasbubba> Long sword is a pretty easy option to tackle Kirin with. Since you can parry the lightning if you put yourself in a bad spot.
[2:46:57] <%guykazamatankbuster> Kirin is nothing with lance
[2:46:58] <%Sora20030c> I didn't have trouble with kirin while using hammer after figuring out his tells
[2:46:59] <SulfurousAcid> @AngriestPat use the dragon peircer when he falls down
[2:47:06] <%Sora20030c> though it took a bit longer than with other hunts
[2:47:12] <Ell1ot> he got a new face
[2:47:13] <+Helghast102> smash that tail button
[2:47:14] <%Remery_> @SGrim oh damn
[2:47:15] <%AbnormalVoid> smash that muh fukkin like tail
[2:47:24] <HentaiSpyder> arrows mostly bounce off Kirin...

[2:48:05] <+Dasbubba> It does but damage in the sweet spot at close range is higher.

[2:48:08] <%Remery_> You can charge dragon piercer too
[2:48:09] <Soul_Intern> PRO STREAMING
[2:48:10] <Chaoko99> @Jpdodds Right. Uragaan. Same issue.
[2:48:12] <+NiktenKing> @AngriestPat PRESS Y AFTER DODGING FOR MOUNTING ATTACKS
[2:48:13] <+HelloImTom08> Kreygasm
[2:48:13] <DoctorPhilsJazzBand> boo this man
[2:48:14] <Chaoko99> Is he new?
[2:48:15] <+tehpatmarsons> thats what you get for being a dirty melee hunter
[2:48:15] <AncelDeLambert> hfs
[2:48:17] <+bonzosan> amazing
[2:48:22] <%keksisblyat> Gurieto heavy daze... FailFish apatMenace apatMenace apatMenace
[2:48:27] <+SuichiTanaka> Comboing into Dragon Piercer is how you get the guud damage
[2:48:29] <+Superstarsage> Bow's selling me on the game guys
[2:48:35] <bearwagon> dragon piercer is just anime in real time
[2:48:35] <duel_pro> Good now hit triangle/Y while dashing
[2:48:35] <SuperNotSuspiciousMan> Pat got some rust
[2:48:35] <+Quarkee> i just finally figured out how to beat the advanced class bosses in octopath! just do 150000 damage between phases with olberic and youre good
[2:48:36] <Greywyn00> stylish
[2:48:37] <SulfurousAcid> bow is big fun
[2:48:41] <+HelloImTom08> LUL totaolly intentional dodge
[2:48:43] <President_valentine> landing a perfect dragon piercer is so satisfying
[2:48:51] <AncelDeLambert> eat shit
[2:48:58] <+Dasbubba> @angriestpat Dragon Piercer can cut off tails too.
[2:49:02] <+drewg91> ok I'm back in on Monster Hunter
[2:49:02] <deviljhojho94> Use ur insctints
[2:49:03] <%MisterCrimson> not that way
[2:49:05] <+NiktenKing> MOUNT THEN USE DRAGON PIERCER
[2:49:05] <+SevenDeadlyCyns> Just use it all the time
[2:49:06] <CastellanVon> Bow damage basically comes from spamming elemental charge shots on weak points or Diablos Dragon Piercer Crit Draw.
[2:49:06] <element_of_loyalty> :D
[2:49:08] <AncelDeLambert> LUL
[2:49:09] <+HelloImTom08> you do it when they are in a downed state
[2:49:13] <SuperNotSuspiciousMan> Do NOT that
[2:49:13] <+Sdeje> Pat, MHW bow builds charge every shot, you don't need to hold and charge anymore, just fire away
[2:49:13] <cizal11> the same way you get good at hitting true charged slash but with longer range
[2:49:16] <Dapper_Cactuar> does he know about rapid fire power up shots?
[2:49:22] <+OctaivianRex> Make sure they're locked into an animation or down.
[2:49:26] <Innocuous_Goat> You learn the monster's behavior, or just use it while it's downed
[2:49:27] <+larrytron> Dragon piercer when they are downed
[2:49:32] <deviljhojho94> for u
[2:49:38] <+larrytron> Or trapped
[2:49:39] <+tigerfang86> is this another GUNTHROUGH
[2:49:39] <AncelDeLambert> wait, WHAT?! You use the giant fuck-off move when the enemy can't react?! No way, I don't believe that!
[2:49:41] <%THATGUY_789> eat the shit
[2:49:42] <+Dasbubba> Basically use it like a great sword. Where if you see you have a few free seconds because the monster whiffed an attack you go for a piercer. Racks up your damage like crazy.
[2:49:45] <element_of_loyalty> Meow
[2:49:46] <Soul_Intern> getting MEGAFUCKED
[2:50:02] <$SGrim> @AngriestPat as with all monsters and weapons, the answer lies in the heart of battle. Although seriously, learning attack patterns is the way to get gud with dragon piercer.
[2:50:07] <cizal11> that worked pretty good
[2:50:10] <AncelDeLambert> got'im
[2:50:18] <vingadivo> he was doing better wuthout the dragon thing
[2:50:37] <Cykaima> Hey pat have you ever played heavy bowgun? You can at unlock monsters to death with it and it feels great
[2:50:41] <CastellanVon> Radobaan has a ton of armor, Dragon Piercer is the way to go against him
[2:50:47] <Cykaima> Stunlock*
[2:50:49] <+larrytron> Shoot dragon piercer down the spine of the monster to maximize hits
[2:50:59] <+Dasbubba> @sdeje it’s better to charge the shots if you are using power coatings to get the most out of each coating at times. But that being said he isn’t using them here so it’s whatever.
[2:51:02] <AncelDeLambert> Pat getting Fred Dursted, hold on
[2:51:03] <element_of_loyalty> MERCY
[2:51:06] <Greywyn00> juicy
[2:51:08] <President_valentine> you can cut tails with dragon piercer
[2:51:14] <cizal11> lmao
[2:51:14] <+OctaivianRex> To be fair this is about as often as he lands true charge slashes
[2:51:15] <Soul_Intern> BOOM

[2:52:04] <Sephigeta> No but I wish you luck.
[2:52:05] <+chimaera24> Just try to make sure it hits as much of the monster as possible
[2:52:05] <AncelDeLambert> wait for the pattern to end?
[2:52:05] <+HelloImTom08> stop spamming it so much for one
[2:52:05] <$SGrim> @AngriestPat Learning attack patterns is the way to get gud with dragon piercer.
[2:52:09] <%Agami23> hitting the tail with it, it can sever
[2:52:11] <%rdark_ksu> @AngriestPat I recommend using your eyeballs.
[2:52:13] <%SaltyDongs> big cheats
[2:52:13] <President_valentine> learn the monsters movement
[2:52:13] <cizal11> otherwise pretend it's a long ranged true charged slash
[2:52:15] <+Dasbubba> Just wait until you know you have a free few seconds. Think of it like a full charged great sword swing.
[2:52:18] <+ThirstyMichael> did Pat get a beta code?
[2:52:21] <$Sayie> Stop bieng bad Kappa
[2:52:26] <CNExoSoul> DP is only usefull on NE bows, and Elemental bows are the way to go
[2:52:29] <+SuichiTanaka> Dodge a charge, use quick shot, then combo 1 normal shot, then dragon piercer after they've passed you
[2:52:33] <+Rhydarious> you can last minute correct the aim of DP by hitting L2, don't need to predict attack patterns completely
[2:52:33] <$SGrim> @AngriestPat also, aim along the body. It has no limits to the number of times it can pierce, only it's range.
[2:52:35] <%GarbageNirvana> Good time to use it is when he's on his side like that
[2:52:42] <element_of_loyalty> BRILLIANT
[2:52:42] <CNExoSoul> but you want to aim it along the longest path across a monster
[2:52:47] <FrozenMonkey> arexHi

[2:53:02] <+Rhydarious> you can even spin it by as far as 180
[2:53:02] <Soul_Intern> YOU WON

[2:53:10] <deviljhojho94> delicious time

[2:53:12] <duel_pro> Try Y while dashing
[2:53:13] <+Dasbubba> @angriestpat if your bow is charged it also amps up the dragon piercers damage (you can see the arrow glowing red) so either fully charging your bow, firing then piercer amps up the damage.
[2:53:14] <element_of_loyalty> Start the timer
[2:53:16] <+Crippl3> literally never
[2:53:18] <+NiktenKing> Seriously though Pat, use Y after dodging to mount attack, mount and down, then Dragon Piercer
[2:53:21] <Chaoko99> ... Wait that's not an Uragaan?
[2:53:23] <@SSaryn> That's never stopped Pat before
[2:53:23] <+Rhydarious> Tap L2 at last second
[2:53:26] <SulfurousAcid> make sure you have bombs for when they fall asleep then dragon pierce through the bombs to wake them up

[3:13:13] <TeamDattony> Happy Birthday Pat \ BibleThump /
[3:13:13] <$i_am_therydon> no just do it pat. do it flawlessly and perfectly
[3:13:20] <hassanico> is Pilot the worst?
[3:13:30] <element_of_loyalty> DYNOMITE
[3:13:32] <hassanico> Legitimately just the worst?
[3:13:39] <%Jpdodds> no
[3:13:41] <+NiktenKing> Pilot has the worst gun
[3:13:41] <Smithy4224> Pilot's OK, but his starting gun blows ass.
[3:13:42] <%Jpdodds> hes my noi
[3:13:46] <%Ninestempest> last time pat streamed this people said pilot was the best
[3:13:47] <%Jpdodds> boi
[3:13:49] <+NiktenKing> Pilot is the best for unlocking shit
[3:13:51] <$magikestral> pilot is my least fave, but i think convict is the worst
[3:13:53] <Smithy4224> His starting items are nice, though.
[3:13:55] <$i_am_therydon> a bitch ghost!
[3:13:57] <+ItsAGundamu> wait how is he moving so fast?
[3:13:57] <cerberuscarmine> marine and bullet are best
[3:13:58] <hassanico> I would honestly rather play Robot
[3:14:08] <element_of_loyalty> <3 <3 <3
[3:14:09] <cizal11> what is with this level 1 cowardice
[3:14:11] <$Mendin> Pilot is good when Pat's two big complaints are no keys and cant hold his space button items
[3:14:29] <Dr_Donkey_Brains> @ItsAGundamu you can turn on fast mode in the menu
[3:14:32] <%Remery_> Nervous Pat is Best Pat
[3:14:33] <+TastySammiches> pilot is fine but his starter gun suuucks

[3:14:52] <%NME_Dom> the bullet will bounce
[3:14:55] <VritraReiRei> @AngriestPat bounce it off green
[3:15:02] <Louie_Salmon> That looks good
[3:15:05] <survivorofchallenges> oh boy how long has stream been up?
[3:15:05] <+TastySammiches> you can bounce off the green, not the red
[3:15:11] <+treemanfour> bullets bounce 3 times, or till they hit red
[3:15:15] <VritraReiRei> @AngriestPat DONT HIT RED

[3:15:54] <Soul_Intern> ITS GOOD THO
[3:15:54] <+TastySammiches> charge shot should be low tier it's not great
[3:15:54] <VritraReiRei> Charge shot is REALLY good though
[3:15:54] <+Tokanova> it pierces tho
[3:15:55] <hassanico> NOT A CHARGE SHOT
[3:15:59] <%Jpdodds> Hope for a muncher
[3:16:00] <oAznoUta> YOU're weird to fire
[3:16:00] <+Quarkee> you thought it was a good gun but its actually a great gun
[3:16:02] <+Tokanova> IT PIERCES THO
[3:16:05] <frostwarden> hmm

[3:16:23] <%Remery_> It tries it's best :(
[3:16:24] <$magikestral> its piercing is good so probably why its green
[3:16:26] <$Mendin> [Crazy Talk]
[3:16:28] <Rellim80> @AngriestPat Do you know that flipping tables gives you complete invincibility for one second? I tested it out on PS4 after last Stream. So you don't have to be behind the table.
[3:16:29] <+demoncleanr> wtf that gun is nuts in one shots shit on the third/fourth floors
[3:16:33] <Chaoko99> Pat: "Unga DEEPS"
[3:16:36] <hassanico> honestly he really should use it over Pilot's blaster
[3:16:36] <element_of_loyalty> ka blam
[3:16:45] <VritraReiRei> it's a room clearer, bounces off walls and 1 shots bulletkins @AngriestPat
[3:16:53] <+TastySammiches> pat use the charge shot it doesnt suck as much as the stupid pistol
[3:16:54] <SulfurousAcid> why are there ghosts tho
[3:17:04] <Soul_Intern> its a GUNgeon
[3:17:09] <CNExoSoul> pat likes to go *ew pew pew* over *PEW ....... PEW*

[3:17:15] <+guntoad> fuck the mimics in this game LUL
[3:17:15] <$Mendin> Scrambler owns and its synergies are even better
[3:17:17] <$magikestral> @sulfurousacid ghost in the casing
[3:17:18] <+Quarkee> the scrambler is just the second best after the orbital laser
[3:17:19] <%skizzuto> scrambler is eggcellent
[3:17:21] <+TeethMuncher> @SulfurousAcid cause people died in the gungeon
[3:17:23] <+NiktenKing> Scrambler with the Phoenix is amazing
[3:17:25] <JusTTheGuyYouNeed> black hole gun best weapon in the game

[3:17:40] <hassanico> Remote Bullets+Gun Crown
[3:17:42] <cizal11> they're amazing but you have to be using a mouse
[3:17:42] <+TastySammiches> @angriestpat remote bullets are awesome if you play with a mouse like a smart boy
[3:17:43] <+Quarkee> you fucking goon buy that

[3:17:50] <fazoburquina> @AngriestPat I managed my first 2 bullet hell clears THANKS to the remote bullets
[3:17:54] <hassanico> even if he wanted to he doesn't have the money guys
[3:17:54] <survivorofchallenges> trash is only garbage in the hands of a recycled being
[3:17:54] <+NWR_James> Time till pat uses remote bullets exclusively?
[3:17:56] <+Quarkee> thats GOOD
[3:17:56] <$Mendin> He's using a controller so are they still as good?
[3:18:00] <cizal11> how's he gonna use them with a controller tho
[3:18:03] <hassanico> He only has 17 casings
[3:18:06] <%GarbageNirvana> Pat continuing his wrong streak
[3:18:09] <DesuDesuDokiDoki> ye shotty
[3:18:13] <FoggyHunter> Remote bullets are really good... if you use a mouse
[3:18:14] <+Quarkee> you go buy those fucking bullets and you like it
[3:18:15] <element_of_loyalty> EWW REDBULL
[3:18:22] <Rellim80> Yeah. The invincibility the table give is better, but more limited than DR
[3:18:23] <Mr_Strut> So use a mouse, dumdum.
[3:18:28] <+Quarkee> if you use a controller you suck that is correct pat
[3:18:40] <+NiktenKing> Sawed off with faster reloads is good
[3:18:40] <hassanico> Hmmm, two bosses, I wonder if a PIERCING weapon would be good here
[3:18:44] <$Mendin> IF ONLY HE HAD A BURST DAMAGE WEAPON THAT WENT THROUGH ADDS AND DIDNT NEED POINT BLANK RANGE
[3:19:00] <$Mendin> VoHiYo
[3:19:02] <cizal11> charge shot's looking REAL good here

[3:19:57] <Mr_Strut> Phase 2 is still easier, because there's half the enemies shooting you.
[3:19:59] <+Xalgar> @AngriestPat Any plans on adding BTTV emotes?
[3:20:01] <morcego_cinzento> It's kinda like with Ludwig. His first phase is more difficult to telegraph then the second one
[3:20:11] <VritraReiRei> @AngriestPat do you know about the *secret* Run Strat that forces passives to essential break your run?
[3:20:11] <cizal11> totally forgot to check the chests
[3:20:14] <Makoiscutest> !uptime
[3:20:14] <@Moobot> I've been playing this game for how long? Oh only 3h 20m 16s.
[3:20:21] <+Quarkee> the bullet gets laggy after a few upgrades though so i try to avoid it
[3:20:22] <+Tokanova> its so good tho
[3:20:24] <$Mendin> He opened them both, oiled cylender and a shotgun
[3:20:39] <cizal11> LOOK HOW GOOD IT IS lmfao
[3:20:40] <8MinuteAbs> SIMPLE GEOMETRY
[3:20:42] <+Tokanova> "I hate this gun" *clears room in 3 shots with it*
[3:20:42] <%MisterCrimson> i dunno, seems like a pretty good gun to me
[3:20:42] <fazoburquina> Charge shot is amazing
[3:20:46] <Louie_Salmon> You're aiming really well on controller btw
[3:20:46] <reonome> but its good???
[3:20:47] <DesuDesuDokiDoki> looks cool
[3:20:48] <hassanico> he fucking hates this gun and yet he's getting rebound after rebound
[3:20:48] <Sephigeta> Sems good to me.
[3:20:51] <$Mendin> PAT STOP BEING GUN-TSUNDERE
[3:20:52] <%SplatterAte> why do you hate it, it seem good
[3:20:53] <Ell1ot> why do you hate this gun? you can fire around corners with it
[3:20:55] <element_of_loyalty> I love Pats PJSalt
[3:20:56] <josh813318> how can he hate it when it's so good?
[3:20:59] <+seriousink> "this gun's a piece of shit" pat says as he pulls off sick revolver ocelot shit
[3:21:07] <$magikestral> gundere
[3:21:10] <%aDbIgLiLunifan> pat is not a smart man
[3:21:11] <+TastySammiches> it's mediocre for a mid-tier gun
[3:21:11] <+McSnazzyPants> @Mendin you mean gundere? Kappa
[3:21:11] <oAznoUta> @Mendin that's GUN-DERE do you
[3:21:15] <%MisterCrimson> I'm sure Paige says that about Pat all the time
[3:21:16] <VritraReiRei> > hates the gun, 1 shots most things and uses 2-3 ammo per room to clear 🤔
[3:21:23] <+Xalgar> Gun has a fun mechanic "It's shit"
[3:21:25] <hassanico> So many keys!
[3:21:26] <+whiskywolfe> Those little dudes give me crazy Gravity Falls vibes
[3:21:27] <morcego_cinzento> Pat wouldn't be himself if he hated a gun that is clearly super good, but hates it anyway cause reasons
[3:21:27] <Tisaric> so lucky with the Key RNG
[3:21:30] <+Crippl3> FUCK
[3:21:30] <+Quarkee> my personal favorite is the gungine after you get an aim upgrade
[3:21:31] <+NiktenKing> It's like a worse sling but with piercing
[3:21:31] <+CaptainJax> ENDLESS TRASH
[3:21:32] <element_of_loyalty> super soaker

[3:21:44] <CrimsonCore90> Pat is charging crazy talk y'all. once he admits its a good gun in his heart, it stops being an awesome gun
[3:21:44] <+DuurHuur> That baloon gun is top tier
[3:21:48] <+ahdurian> E X C U S E S
[3:21:49] <survivorofchallenges> the charge shot can't be defeated

[3:25:42] <%Agami23> too bad you have no guns with piercing.
[3:25:43] <reonome> PAT TILTED
[3:25:47] <Tisaric> The bullet is super good agains the ammoconda

[3:25:55] <+LastHazzerd> playing this game is stressful, but watching the patterns is so pretty
[3:25:56] <hassanico> SNAKE WAS NEVER A GOOD GAME
[3:25:56] <Quietshun13> I never had much trouble with him tbh
[3:25:58] <Sloavon> "I feel really bad for this guy" *eats shit*
[3:25:58] <VritraReiRei> Angriest Pat. Emphasis on ANGRY
[3:25:59] <+Crippl3> jesus
[3:26:00] <+DuurHuur> Ammoconda, Mine Flayer and Tank Fucker are the fucking worst

[3:26:06] <+TastySammiches> A N G E R Y
[3:26:07] <Sephigeta> Yay you did it!
[3:26:08] <+Gooniekorn> the ammocondas minions just have too much HP
[3:26:08] <$Mendin> Maybe... not being right in the grundle of a giant enemy that can shoot out of evert part of its body?
[3:26:09] <%SaltyDongs> Pat are you ok?
[3:26:10] <%aDbIgLiLunifan> pat loves to eat bullets with his face
[3:26:11] <%Ralfclogs> apatPat

[3:26:18] <dekkitout> spiteful victory ftw
[3:26:19] <fazoburquina> @AngriestPat funny enough, the chargeshot would have penetrated and hit the boss multiple times
[3:26:20] <+Retrash> hey pat, on the map screen press the right stick to zoom it out. Makes traversing much easier
[3:26:21] <Sam_the_brave> wrong opinion GET
[3:26:22] <+Elexius> If only charged shot was here to pierce through the whole boss
[3:26:23] <$magikestral> oh god, get rid of that eyepaych as soon as you can.
[3:26:24] <+Mikatonic> isn't that easier with charge-chan?
[3:26:24] <Chaoko99> WASTED
[3:26:25] <TranquilTurnip> and not a blank was used
[3:26:25] <Killbones> eyeatch is acc down damage up
[3:26:26] <+styr13> lobosRage lobosRage
[3:26:26] <element_of_loyalty> HOT PEPPER
[3:26:27] <%Agami23> if only you had a piercing weapon and something to get rid of bullets on the screen
[3:26:27] <+SirRoyco> It's not that hard, if you watch the bullet snake pattern and stay back
[3:26:28] <%SaltyDongs> You feel better now buddy
[3:26:28] <$magikestral> it lowers accuracy
[3:26:29] <Chaoko99> WASTED BLANKS
[3:26:34] <VritraReiRei> @hassanico lowers accuracy but more damage
[3:26:36] <Sephigeta> What makes you hate it so?

[4:03:35] <%Sora20030c> nothing
[4:03:37] <Dr_Donkey_Brains> they're clues to a maze
[4:03:38] <knomad2b> talks shit
[4:03:38] <DesuDesuDokiDoki> yea my bio
[4:03:41] <CNExoSoul> nothing for the most part
[4:03:42] <%Sora20030c> besides the maze thing
[4:03:42] <Cosairen> absolutely nothing but insult you
[4:03:43] <%eveningmars> it means an asshole stole your item
[4:03:51] <Hunk_Of_Dunk> The fucked up part is that R2G2 isn't even the best companion
[4:03:55] <Kataguro> The sounds it makes is really cute
[4:03:55] <%craig_t> whats the bird do?
[4:03:58] <+rooked4> Yeah, just means you wasted a key and lost an item
[4:03:59] <DesuDesuDokiDoki> he do his best
[4:04:05] <Kataguro> It shoots a little fire sometimes
[4:04:08] <fruit_pie_the_magician> i want it on record that i hate this game and im only here because i want to see you get salty when you die
[4:04:09] <Hunk_Of_Dunk> Bird is a synergy for the phoenix gun, it shoots fireballs at enemies sometimes
[4:04:15] <VritraReiRei> @craig_t periodically shoots enemies
[4:04:20] <%eveningmars> the Blank companion's description is "he tries"
[4:04:23] <Sparty9112> Pat couldnt steal more guns from Matt so he went to the Gungeon to steal more.
[4:04:29] <+capnbeeb> pewpewpewpew

[4:04:53] <CNExoSoul> *junkan
[4:04:56] <Hunk_Of_Dunk> He's no gold junkan LUL
[4:05:05] <fazoburquina> the Payday 2 guys are better, imo. The one that spams blanks is a life saver
[4:05:18] <mayorrev> Junkan is like a son
[4:05:20] <%eveningmars> you've got to devote a run to junkan if you want gold
[4:05:26] <mayorrev> you feed him and he becomes stronger

[4:06:47] <TyrantBelial> what does the curse do?
[4:06:48] <+Crippl3> @AngriestPat it's a melee weapon that reflects bullets
[4:06:49] <$magikestral> @angriestpat it is very strong and reflects bullets, just don't get hit
[4:06:49] <Soul_Intern> IN YM GUN?
[4:06:50] <+NiktenKing> STUNROD THE BEST WEAPON IN THE GAME

[4:08:06] <%Sora20030c> the sling does more damage than I remember
[4:08:06] <Hunk_Of_Dunk> There's the colt again
[4:08:07] <cheezbass> scaring me at the end there
[4:08:07] <Nemesisnick33> wtf is sling and why is it so strong?
[4:08:09] <+ImpHelpSingIt> fukken got em
[4:08:12] <%Jpdodds> toe curling stuff there
[4:08:12] <Sparty9112> people underestimate the sling
[4:08:15] <Hunk_Of_Dunk> The sling does double damage to bosses
[4:08:17] <+TNT3Rays> pat is afraid of imics
[4:08:18] <deviljhojho94> sling, ya know, like david and goliath
[4:08:23] <$Mendin> Sling is a weak charge weapon that gets a bonus agtainst big e nemies ie bosses
[4:08:24] <Hunk_Of_Dunk> and does double damage _again_ if you bounce it off a wall and hit a boss
[4:08:31] <Cosairen> @Nemesisnick33 its a sling and its a bible thingy
[4:08:37] <Sparty9112> the bat is also cursed
[4:08:37] <$Mendin> bc david & goliath
[4:08:39] <%skizzuto> use it to hit enemies into other enemies!
[4:08:40] <+James_Quivers> Hit a regular enemy with it lmao
[4:08:45] <$magikestral> hit an enemy with it for big damage
[4:08:45] <nepwar> it does big damage if you hit enemies with it
[4:08:47] <knomad2b> it hurts a bunch
[4:08:48] <+Crippl3> @AngriestPat casey comes out of blue or brown chests normally, can't remember
[4:08:50] <+Retrash> hit enemies with it and you'll see it's even nutter
[4:08:55] <purple_bagel> Big dameg
[4:08:59] <Hunk_Of_Dunk> Even if you bounce off a wall and hit a boss it only does as much damage as one single casey swing
[4:09:05] <Hunk_Of_Dunk> Casey is FUCKED
[4:09:12] <Sparty9112> careful the red ones do double damage.
[4:09:13] <deviljhojho94> what the fuck
[4:09:13] <Kataguro> It's bullshit that Casey AND the Sling are both D
[4:09:14] <Cosairen> thats nutty

[4:10:58] <Kataguro> This weapon is hella blasphemous
[4:11:02] <Midnight188> I forget are Jammed enemies just stronger or is it that their projectiles can't be blanked?
[4:11:02] <+Tapt58> What is this blasphemous blunt non bullet object?

[4:11:08] <%CJett92> gg
[4:11:09] <SwindlerOfProgress> Jeez, I never actually used it as a melee weapon. I always just deflected shots. It's so strong.

[4:11:15] <%SneakyPenguin77> @AngriestPat CONVICT PLEASE

[4:11:22] <%Jpdodds> ONE MORE RUN ONE MORE RUN
[4:11:23] <+ImpHelpSingIt> I SURE AM HUNGRY
[4:11:26] <%Jpdodds> !uptime
[4:11:27] <@Moobot> I've been playing this game for how long? Oh only 4h 11m 28s.
[4:11:35] <DesuDesuDokiDoki> ha
[4:11:37] <+Crippl3> the marine pistol is good
[4:11:39] <Dr_Donkey_Brains> that's insane
[4:11:44] <knomad2b> its the best starter
[4:11:45] <Kataguro> The Ryu of Gungeon
[4:11:47] <+NeutrinoInteraction> The marine pistol is so weak though
[4:11:48] <+ItsAGundamu> I like the hunters bow
[4:11:49] <+Crippl3> fun fact, the marine pistole does less damage than the hunter pistol
[4:11:54] <Hunk_Of_Dunk> It's the second best starter IMO
[4:11:57] <Hunk_Of_Dunk> well
[4:12:01] <Nemesisnick33> threw away run with lil robo thing for dum bat NotLikeThis
[4:12:04] <+Retrash> what convict has the 2nd best
[4:12:06] <Hunk_Of_Dunk> It's the best default, but both of the secret starters are better
[4:12:07] <+NiktenKing> Convicts pistol is amazing
[4:12:08] <+rooked4> Its not my favorite, but it makes me not hate myself in the first level
[4:12:09] <nepwar> not mentioning peashooter
[4:12:21] <JusTTheGuyYouNeed> her ability is awesome
[4:12:21] <MonsieurHedge> hero best character
[4:12:23] <+LastHazzerd> what does the robot character do
[4:12:25] <purple_bagel> Convicts is great if you spam click
[4:12:26] <MonsieurHedge> or whatever swordy mcbullet is named
[4:12:31] <+NeutrinoInteraction> The robot character makes you lose runs
[4:12:31] <%SneakyPenguin77> I like the Convict's gun
[4:12:36] <Kataguro> Ah yes, a GLUE-on
[4:12:42] <JusTTheGuyYouNeed> bullet has the best starter
[4:12:46] <$RaikenTB> gluon gun? PogChamp
[4:12:54] <hassanico> Glass Guan breaks no?
[4:12:58] <Kataguro> Yeah, on hit
[4:13:12] <Kataguro> But if you get like 4 they're pretty good
[4:13:13] <Midnight188> Y'all are forgetting the best gun: The Black Hole Gun
[4:13:15] <SwindlerOfProgress> I can't stand playing the Pilot. I hate his gun too much and I like using the base weapon for my character a lot.
[4:13:20] <%Agami23> labrys and mitsuru got into blazbluecrosstag
[4:13:41] <SwindlerOfProgress> I have the easiest time with him, too.
[4:13:42] <hassanico> btw my power went out, what killed the last run?
[4:13:47] <nepwar> cue crazy talk when he does get bullet king
[4:13:49] <Kataguro> Pat's overconfidence with Casey
[4:13:50] <Dr_Donkey_Brains> is he considered the hardest? ifor me its the bird dude
[4:13:53] <reonome> king is easy
[4:13:54] <knomad2b> gatling gulls the hardest 1st for me. it's stupid
[4:13:55] <SwindlerOfProgress> @hassanico The Casey, basically.
[4:13:58] <+Crippl3> PogChamp
[4:13:59] <Hunk_Of_Dunk> Best guns are obviously Gunther and Elimentaler
[4:14:01] <MonsieurHedge> alright how many caped bullets has pat killed
[4:14:01] <Chichen> @hassanico Overconfidence is a slow and insidious killer.
[4:14:02] <Kataguro> It is over now
[4:14:04] <Shade075> PogChamp
[4:14:04] <%Agami23> its the quadlazer it will amaz-ya
[4:14:05] <+capnbeeb> oh fuck me that's what that damn thing is referencing
