[0:35:03] <%ToneBacas> at some point you might as well remove spiders if that slider keeps going
[0:35:06] <%Mendin> The game Satisfactory does Araphnophobia Safe Mode really well: It replaces spiders with a jpg of a kitten's face
[0:35:06] <+terraspan> Justin Time!
[0:35:07] <eternalquarantine> australian spiders???
[0:35:08] <SirKeigan> IF you don't like spiders then you can't play. Game over

[0:35:14] <%zeroarturia> Fuck that. I have arachnophobia and I say go ALL in.
[0:35:16] <%the22cstomp> pat the max level arachnophobia setting is more horrifying than the normal spider

[0:35:36] <%RyTYoung> @xxumbraninja Abby hates you
[0:35:40] <%CappuccinoGuil> @Joustar_ this game is more objective focused AND items respawn
[0:35:40] <%GarbageNirvana> you know it's weird but I feel like I can deal with giant monster spiders than regular sized creep around you spiders and I'm not sure why
[0:35:41] <+Moxhasan> @PatStaresAt All I will say is do the quests because a lot is locked behind progress
[0:35:44] <dinnydanny777> A Bear?

[0:59:26] <%XeroSigmaPrime> Now that your small, do you physically have less blood and thus need less water? Or do you have the same amount of matter but its just denser?

[0:59:57] <heartlesshealer> Pat
[1:00:05] <Maleicus> has pat never seen a clover
[1:00:07] <Parapattern> If Pat was a bug he'd be a stink bug
[1:00:07] <CallMeB> must be the last one of the season
[1:00:08] <%Promessa_EX> clovers are black when they are bad
[1:00:08] <%Konquerer> so when does a squirrel just grab you and eat your head
[1:00:09] <XxUmbraNinja> Pat
[1:00:10] <%doc_ock_rokc> @PatStaresAt clovers are by the scale
[1:00:10] <+Ez3z> you can use the dandelion things to float when you jump off stuff
[1:00:11] <heartlesshealer> clovers are not serrated
[1:00:12] <juanpablobro2punto0> imagine when they introduce mantises. i mean THEY EAT SPIDERS
[1:00:13] <$Afterman_> they huntin
[1:00:15] <+OwlLightningMage> Space Dandy Lion King
[1:00:16] <@Mechz71> ANTS HUNT IN PACKS
[1:00:16] <%Emperor_Machinus> Pat just met a smash player

[1:00:17] <StarlingSilence> neon genesis dandelion
[1:00:18] <boogaleeboo> They work for a living
[1:00:18] <Lophostrix_> just got here, has he seen spiders yet?
[1:00:22] <mellorolo> because youre not-irish.
[1:00:23] <$QueequegTheater> @PatStaresAt Pat do you not know what a clover is?
[1:00:27] <%Mendin> pat does not know what plants look like
[1:00:28] <$Afterman_> he has not seen spiders
[1:00:30] <XxUmbraNinja> No
[1:00:31] <heartlesshealer> if it's anything like irl, find damp soil
[1:00:33] <%doc_ock_rokc> @Lophostrix_ nope
[1:00:36] <+Estuko> @juanpablobro2punto0 A video one eating a Giant Hornet's head alive

[1:00:52] <Lutre> famine?
[1:00:55] <DexteraXIII> Whiskey?
[1:00:56] <%XeroSigmaPrime> Wouldnt you pass out nearly immediately from being this small since your body is not at all built for this size?
[1:00:57] <+FattimusSlime> Can you steal ant queen pheromones and enslave the ants to do your bidding?
[1:00:58] <%CappuccinoGuil> @QueequegTheater there's no clover in that area, so no wonder he didn't find any
[1:01:02] <%Emperor_Machinus> Potatos?
[1:01:04] <%ToneBacas> potatoes?
[1:01:04] <+mel0dica> potatos
[1:01:09] <Parapattern> The holiday was introduced as an excuse to beat the Irish

[1:05:12] <Parapattern> You're going to die Pat
[1:05:14] <Twoiis> I get the impression that the game is more intended for multiplayer.
[1:05:14] <Ultra_Pancake> Also just being super careful to spot spiders coming when traversing.
[1:05:16] <%Mendin> Pat why do you keep heading back to Arachnotopia
[1:05:18] <$RealThiele> clever girl

[1:08:24] <heartlesshealer> make a canteen so you can collect water later
[1:08:25] <%XeroSigmaPrime> @Snowfellow I mean Antman atleast rectifies that by explaining even though molecular bonds are much closer, they maintain the same amount of energy between them. This game has us drinking a drop of water to be fully hydrated, which breaks that rule HARD
[1:08:26] <Lutre> just drink water stupid 4Head
[1:08:26] <LazyKaijuX> good luck finding some
[1:08:33] <+Ez3z> find the juice boxes, they restore thirst and hunger

[1:11:40] <privatesargent> thats a generally smart idea, but ants drop crafting material to amek better armor so you are going to have to fight them eventually

[1:29:39] <$Fortunato5678> It is small, maybe they'll add the house
[1:29:42] <%YakumoYomi> ...and that's one of the reasons why spiders are modded out of my Skyrim VR. Because FUCK one of them horse-sized monstrosities leaping at my face.
[1:29:42] <circular7> greedy pat is greedy
[1:29:43] <%CappuccinoGuil> Also, Pat, if you set your gear to your hotpouch, when you pick it up it'll auto set everythign
[1:29:45] <Vilecrow> that looked like a dead spider
[1:29:45] <%DedlokPM> ***
[1:29:50] <%penitentpentwitch> Huh, Motion blur is a slider
[1:29:52] <%ragingbrachy> yea
[1:29:53] <Ultra_Pancake> Yeah, turning off motion blur would be nice.
[1:29:55] <heartlesshealer> paige hiccups just sound like vomit. She's fine
[1:29:56] <+GenesisKnight> I imagine they'll add more when it fully releases
[1:30:00] <XxUmbraNinja> Yeah
[1:30:02] <Sol_Install> a dead spider faces upward
[1:30:04] <+pectusumbra> under gamma yeah

[1:30:08] <+necrocannibal2> @patstaresat what do you think of the game so far?
[1:30:11] <%ragingbrachy> someone told me motion blur is bad so i hate it
[1:30:12] <SovPho> I take credit for this idea.

[1:30:33] <%ToneBacas> maybe it's the hotbar shortcuts thing
[1:30:35] <Zombrocom> You did say hotpouch
[1:30:38] <%honeyman18> Did you know children enter spiders mouths at least one time during a spiders life?
[1:30:41] <%CappuccinoGuil> Yeah, see? All your items are in the same slots
[1:30:42] <black_pariah> youve already got everthing set

[2:02:45] <%SvenHolgersson> I took 5 years of German and I can only read it kinda
[2:02:47] <%ragingbrachy> i too cannot do math and took two years of frencgh
[2:02:48] <SirKeigan> She remembers that but not what she did yesterday?!?!
[2:02:52] <%GarbageQueenEllie> I mean, you won't need trig for shit, but basic algebra is important

[2:03:24] <%SvenHolgersson> I mean american public schools did no one ANY favors
[2:03:24] <%doc_ock_rokc> @chhdez Thats because white people are more likely to be lactose intollorant
[2:03:26] <%Jack_of_No_Trades> 6 and 9 are different numbers, not opposites
[2:03:26] <%TaterBurglar> To be fair, doing it in your head helps you make harder problems easier cause you can do the little parts faster
[2:03:26] <%ragingbrachy> :)
[2:03:28] <%DavidCrimsonHeidern> I can Tell Pagie.
