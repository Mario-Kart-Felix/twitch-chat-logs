[0:06:23] <RubberFistFight> @Bailey__gaming anything in particular you're anxious about or is it just one of those bad days that happens?
[0:06:44] <SpaceGuntank> haha time for more extremely dystopian cyberpunk! yeah!
[0:06:56] <sonofthedeepsouth> Pat just throwingnracial slurs willy nilly in chat. You guys know it happens. He does that when he isn't streaming.
[0:07:12] <sonofthedeepsouth> I mean how many epic gamer moments Pat had
[0:07:20] <sonofthedeepsouth> Realistic speaking
[0:07:23] <zamzoph> I wonder if Pat will stream all of Cyberpunk, or only preview it 🤔
[0:07:27] <+dangerillustrated> people be in pats house watching him over his shoulder lol
[0:07:31] <sonofthedeepsouth> I'd say a solid 50
[0:07:42] <bear_breaker20> its k Pat renewed his N-word pass like a good canadian
[0:07:42] <nukle0nik> so much for pat starting on europe-friendly hours

[0:07:48] <RubberFistFight> @sonofthedeepsouth yeah I'm pretty sure that's just straight-up not true. Pat is a lot of things, but a racist bigot isn't one of them.
[0:07:56] <atgithursdays> Does Shame Chicken count as a heated gamer moment?
[0:08:04] <+shivpotato> i gotta say, this game was not fun to play for me

[0:22:52] <+whatyousayian98> Elmo baby
[0:22:54] <RubberFistFight> @AngriestPat because they're digital formats, you can easily convert between them by basically changing the shape of the plug. There's some caveats, like different standards might limit your resolution/refresh rate, but you can very easily get around that. Like I said, HMU on the twatters after stream if you want to do it, and I can draw diagrams and shit. Diagrams are fun.
[0:22:56] <%ButtMcChuggles> @jetnjenkins Thankyou!

[0:24:53] <+conradical> get 2 and then chain them end to end
[0:24:53] <BillyBoomsticks> No sound through dvi though.
[0:24:53] <nukle0nik> you can just get a short adapter cable and then a longer DVI cable
[0:24:54] <%walternatorz> lay flat and double that
[0:24:56] <%skizzuto> Elmo is lookin thicc and chonky from this angle
[0:24:57] <+DesertPenguin> SO get 20
[0:24:58] <lotharrio> Ten feet is like... three meters.

[0:25:14] <RubberFistFight> @AngriestPat I suggest holding off on cable purchases for now, if you can tolerate me grilling you about stuff after stream, i can coach you.
[0:25:14] <%SWFanatic> No do more shopping on stream. Fuck it
[0:25:16] <bear_breaker20> elmo is concerned
[0:25:17] <nukle0nik> so you big embarass yourself pat
[0:25:19] <%AgniBrandt> Could buy a cable and a separate adapter if you can't find just a cable of the right lenght

[0:26:04] <%Sphincter_Spelunker> A year? What was a year ago.. Oh
[0:26:08] <%Deadpal> a streaming pc doesn't have to be intensive at all
[0:26:09] <nukle0nik> yes it matters for streaming
[0:26:10] <%JJCheeker> Elmo looks how I feel
[0:26:12] <dukenux> he jiggle

[0:26:18] <%aishman> Just go TRAIL BY FIRE you cowards
[0:26:18] <42nfl19> i5 or i7?
[0:26:19] <%Deadpal> just throw a ssd in there and don't worry
[0:26:20] <rytisone> totally enough
[0:26:20] <Aydarkzero> that should prob be fine enough?
[0:26:21] <nukle0nik> oh my god
[0:26:21] <%MelBrooksKA> That should be good I think
[0:26:21] <%SWFanatic> ElMOOO cows hes got spots like a moo cow
[0:26:23] <%rumtumtugnutz> Big old
[0:26:25] <blaggablag> That's basically my old gaming pc
[0:26:25] <Angry_Ev1L> it should be fine
[0:26:30] <RubberFistFight> @AngriestPat depends on the specs, but you should be able to squeeze 1080p60@Veryfast out of it easily enough. May wanna drop a new processor in just in case.
[0:26:35] <nukle0nik> it'd take all that load off your current PC
[0:26:37] <+BringBackSempai> We are born of floof, made twitch streamers by floof, undone by floof

[0:26:38] <DriedLeafJuice> why wouldn't it be?
[0:26:41] <%Deadpal> yes. streaming FROM one pc TO another one
[0:26:43] <%Deadpal> is always better
[0:26:47] <%Deadpal> ALWAYS
[0:26:47] <$daveronald> cpu should be fine
[0:26:48] <%trustycoyote> Like having a dedicated PC to handle audio and video?
[0:26:49] <zamzoph> Just throw everything away and start over
[0:26:49] <Railgun5> @AngriestPat A streaming PC needs lower specs because it's just streaming video, not playing a game and streaming video simultaneously
[0:26:50] <%corepool> apatWink
[0:26:51] <taro_m> Live PC building stream?
[0:26:53] <%MelBrooksKA> Do it you bitch
[0:26:55] <nukle0nik> your current PC has to play a game AND stream Pat
[0:26:56] <%axellogic> I mean it's not going to be doing anything else
[0:26:59] <%cvp5127> just turn the game off
[0:26:59] <MassConnect> ada WAIT
[0:27:00] <RubberFistFight> @AngriestPat yes, it's faster, but it's also pulling double-duty between both streaming and gameplay at 4K60 - which is hugely demanding.
[0:27:02] <%SWFanatic> Faster like more number or bigger number
[0:27:02] <Aydarkzero> use slobs to auto tune it and try it out
[0:27:03] <leinadtonu> wait
[0:27:04] <Sir_Dolphinian> as someone who almost never has the chance to pop into a stream is this what its always like??
[0:27:05] <+RiceeFTW> it can't be an i7 if it's a 2500

[0:27:08] <shiny_prinny> wait

[0:28:03] <%Deadpal> where you can stream one obs to another obs as long as they're in the same network.
[0:28:04] <worldbrand> This sounds like something you should talk to another streamer about
[0:28:05] <nukle0nik> does it not have PCI-Express?
[0:28:05] <Aydarkzero> speaking of pc parts i just bought a 2700x and 1660

[0:28:20] <%BallerSwagBro9k> Use a Retroaxial Turn cable @angriestpat
[0:28:20] <%Sphincter_Spelunker> what's elmo looking at
[0:28:20] <$daveronald> eithernet from gaming pc to old PC
[0:28:23] <%MelBrooksKA> Worst case it doesn't work and you just unplug it
[0:28:23] <rytisone> is it x8 or x16
[0:28:25] <CapCasual> @AngriestPat You can buy a new pc to be the streaming one for like U$500, maybe less.
[0:28:26] <RubberFistFight> OH yeah you need PCI E x3 i think, at least
[0:28:26] <invisi_bliss> Thanks for the HahaSweat @mixedelirium
[0:28:26] <+Shoosler> My daddy needs to call PC Express
[0:28:27] <%Deadpal> @RubberFistFight apparantly not if he doesn't have a capture card for the old pc
[0:28:29] <%trustycoyote> probably x16
[0:28:29] <%Deadpal> yeah.
[0:28:30] <+tierst> critroleBrian critroleBrian critroleBrian
[0:28:34] <%Ipsenscastle> doesnt getting a new mobo pretty much require also getting a new processor and junk?
[0:28:36] <EuropanLamprey> The FBI always said numbers are important
[0:28:37] <nukle0nik> you should look into this
[0:28:40] <%SWFanatic> Put that baby center stage
[0:28:47] <nukle0nik> it's not gonna explode
[0:28:49] <Angry_Ev1L> WHY WOULD IT BE
[0:28:49] <%Niney_Who> how would it be broken
[0:28:51] <%XeroSigmaPrime> Nahhhhh
[0:28:52] <%Chichen> worry about later i guess'
[0:28:52] <%reonome> a year since... the day
[0:28:54] <%ClaudeMcGarren> why would it be broken
[0:28:55] <+BuriasDempsey> if you touch it maybe
[0:28:56] <MassConnect> it'll only seeem broken
[0:28:58] <$daveronald> sell on ebay buy new
[0:28:59] <worldbrand> Watch out for spiders hiding in the GPU
[0:29:00] <%MelBrooksKA> You could salvage parts
[0:29:00] <%trustycoyote> Why would it be broken?
[0:29:01] <nukle0nik> you'll only find out by actually trying to turn it on
[0:29:01] <42nfl19> So what is going on right now? I missed the start with him not knowing a monitor does not have buttons. But what led to that?
[0:29:03] <derekwst3> but it has all the porns
[0:29:03] <dukenux> usually when you exchange MB, you also have to get buncha other new stuff
[0:29:04] <%Dr00_PhD> it's totally gonna explode
[0:29:05] <%thebeargoesHONK> remove the cloud, improve stream
[0:29:06] <Angry_Ev1L> ?????

[0:29:25] <%SwdVengeance> Computers are like penises? You don't use it, you lose it?
[0:29:26] <+DesertPenguin> that makes absolutely no sense whatsoever

[0:31:55] <%ClaudeMcGarren> @Soulbishop pats stupid cause he didnt know that monitors had buttons to changed the source or that there were dvi to hdmi cables his brain began to break
[0:32:00] <%Bt_Robot> So did Pat just have a stroke?
[0:32:02] <%Ipsenscastle> I feel like Pat is just falling apart like a wet cake
[0:32:04] <derekwst3> press F for Pat
[0:32:04] <blackbaron98> Oh boy that observer sure was somthing else
[0:32:07] <derekwst3> F
[0:32:08] <+yoshkosh20> he's not actually fixing anything. just quietly weeping
[0:32:08] <JacktheMan18> Wait what's happening with Pat?
[0:32:09] <MassConnect> this is going to make a great youtube archive with all the chat missing
[0:32:14] <%Sphincter_Spelunker> Pat's having a stroke right now. Gotta recenter
[0:32:19] <%mixedelirium> I guess the YT archive will be starting from this part, eh?
[0:32:20] <DriedLeafJuice> @XeroSigmaPrime I meant ONLY in the "you need to run it" sense. Analogies man
[0:32:22] <ape_hawk> yo, who else is watching crisis right now?
[0:32:24] <%Soulbishop> Does he need to change his stream setup @ClaudeMcGarren
[0:32:25] <%StaceMcGate> Pat stares at Technical Difficulties (Part 1)
[0:32:25] <fockniapo> I reccomend GTFO it's pretty fun
[0:32:25] <nukle0nik> pat's brain is hemorrhaging
[0:32:29] <%BallerSwagBro9k> Maybe he shat his pants again
[0:32:35] <%ClaudeMcGarren> @JacktheMan18 he somehow just figured out that monitors have buttons and can change sources and that dvi to hdmi cables exist
[0:32:41] <%SWFanatic> You eat tha poopoo
[0:32:43] <SilverFaustX> woolie from super best friends could figure it out
[0:32:44] <derekwst3> @ape_hawk going to watch it tommorrow
[0:32:54] <JacktheMan18> LUL
[0:32:56] <blackbaron98> @SilverFaustX LUL
[0:32:58] <%arcaderabbit48> You know, I remember during the Demon Souls stream, everyone joked about a single comment breaking Woolie. How you could see the Woolie.exe error message appear. Well, now we know what Pat.exe error messages look like too. Cause that shit was a full crash to desktop
[0:33:05] <MassConnect> I need to check woolie's twitter
[0:33:09] <%augusm> Stream canceled due to minor inconveniences
[0:33:11] <%StaceMcGate> I bet Boat Master Kenny knows how to use his sources
[0:33:12] <%ClaudeMcGarren> @Soulbishop he was talking about maybe using the work pc from the office as a stream pc
[0:33:12] <nukle0nik> pat and woolie have 1 brain cell they share
[0:33:15] <rytisone> he should stream setuping the pc, that would be a treat
[0:33:23] <DraxTD> so this was a fake troll stream alllllll alone
[0:33:24] <%Soulbishop> Doesn't he have a 1080 in the current rig? shouldn't it support hdmi to hdmi?
[0:33:24] <DraxTD> g
[0:33:26] <%XeroSigmaPrime> @DriedLeafJuice But you dont need to run it every once in awhile? The only thing that can happen if you dont run it is capacitors can get blown up if you have a breaker in your house trip the longer the pc isnt in use
[0:33:29] <%This_is_Marco> I mean I never knew these things existed until I had an AV job
[0:33:31] <%Ipsenscastle> BSOP

[0:33:51] <%XeroSigmaPrime> @DriedLeafJuice And you'd have to keep the PC plugged in the whole time to runthat risk
[0:33:54] <waifoong98> @nukle0nik wait, they aren't 2 halves of the same brain?

[0:34:11] <%ClaudeMcGarren> @Soulbishop no one said change
[0:34:11] <+Clundy> Ye
[0:34:14] <%shattywack> If you're looking to do a double pc stream setup then you're good. The stream pc doesn't need to be nearly as powerful as the gaming pc
[0:34:15] <%Valdorick> Its a good spot
[0:34:16] <%cureneckbeard> elmo spot
[0:34:16] <%ClaudeMcGarren> @Soulbishop duel setup
[0:34:17] <nukle0nik> just restarting the stream, pretending nothing happened lol
[0:34:21] <%Lurantis_> @jetjenkins thanks so much for the sub!
[0:34:21] <%This_is_Marco> @ClaudeMcGarren ahh LUL
[0:34:22] <%StaceMcGate> Reminder Elmo is an elder being and cannot die

[0:34:30] <%Sphincter_Spelunker> Ask Max
[0:34:30] <%cureneckbeard> apatWhat
[0:34:30] <%HoIlywood_SN> @AngriestPat i think you lost 15 IQ points in real time
[0:34:31] <%skizzuto> It's okay Paige, we know you're possessing Pat's body right now
[0:34:31] <%Ipsenscastle> Big dementia
[0:34:37] <OvaltineDream> all is forgiven
[0:34:40] <ShineTheDiamond> <3
[0:34:40] <%BallerSwagBro9k> Pat the Broken
[0:34:41] <DXLelouch24> Now your both broken
[0:34:42] <nukle0nik> just don't think about it now, play game
[0:34:44] <Angry_Ev1L> just ask MAX later for help
[0:34:45] <+Mr_Pylon> Shelve it for now and do it later, dude
[0:34:45] <derekwst3> @AngriestPat its okay we love you boomer
[0:34:47] <%cureneckbeard> pat machine broke
[0:34:47] <%dalmek> ah, the mindflood has set in
[0:34:48] <+SolverCODO> His mental train is off the tracks, it'll be a good night
[0:34:49] <leinadtonu> you don't say.
[0:34:50] <%StaceMcGate> Slurp that monster boi
[0:34:51] <alpacapologist> it happens floeDolan
[0:34:52] <%SWFanatic> "Just don't think about it." -Paige 2019
[0:34:54] <%Agami23> is it not just like streaming with a elgato?
[0:34:54] <%Engwithan_Elder_God> Who has a better story then Pat the Broken.
[0:34:55] <+Bear_Mane> Just buy a Ryzen 3950x
[0:34:55] <ShineTheDiamond> @AngriestPat No worries, we still love you
[0:34:56] <%ClaudeMcGarren> @AngriestPat you sure that was the problem? or that you just figured out monitors have buttons? Kappa
[0:34:56] <%dekkitout> Huh, that's my personal hell
[0:34:56] <Aydarkzero> it might seem complicated but isn't so bad
[0:34:56] <+FlareTitan> the tummy pat pet the TUMMY
[0:34:57] <worldbrand> think about rutger hauer
[0:34:57] <$daveronald> connect two PCs with eithernet and set slave OBS
[0:34:58] <SilverSnowFFXIV> Lies. Brownie too strong.
[0:35:01] <nukle0nik> ask your more succesful friends
[0:35:02] <%Nicos143> is this the full transformation into boomer?
[0:35:05] <jellssssss20> Time for anxiety simulator!
[0:35:06] <%BallerSwagBro9k> MAN THIS GONNA BE AN EPIC STREAM
[0:35:10] <%Bt_Robot> Pat is break
[0:35:10] <%Sphincter_Spelunker> @nukle0nik oof
[0:35:10] <$Dakuu75> I mean, with a 2080 and stuff. your pc should be beast enough to stream and run games on near-max graphics regardless
[0:35:10] <+SolverCODO> We're in uncharted brain waters
[0:35:10] <%cureneckbeard> pat this is because you switched from red bull to monster
[0:35:15] <%trustycoyote> Just think of it as streaming with a console except the console is PC
[0:35:18] <RubberFistFight> @AngriestPat I'm intimately familiar with that, as I run a 2 PC setup. The initial setup is definitely a brain-contorting process, but it's worth it afterwards.
[0:35:23] <DriedLeafJuice> @XeroSigmaPrime humidity, dust, static can affect any board. My laptop died after 5 months of no use, and my father as a computer technician gets cases a lot of cases like that of people wanting to rescue unused old computers.
[0:35:26] <nukle0nik> with a capture card, just like a PS4
[0:35:27] <IminyourBase> capture card
[0:35:27] <%terribleusername> capture card?
[0:35:28] <derekwst3> wires
[0:35:28] <%king_wragles> cords
[0:35:28] <%cureneckbeard> wires pat
[0:35:28] <%MelBrooksKA> ethernet
[0:35:28] <+Shoosler> @AngriestPat to the CAPTURE DEVICE
[0:35:29] <%SWFanatic> with your hands
[0:35:30] <+Clundy> Red Bull is for the weak, Monster gives you engines
[0:35:31] <%Willbo_Baggins> Boomer beverage
[0:35:31] <IminyourBase> internal capture card
[0:35:32] <RubberFistFight> @AngriestPat via a capture card is the traditional route.
[0:35:33] <%Soulbishop> Capture card bridges the gap @AngriestPat
[0:35:35] <nukle0nik> no, into a capture card
[0:35:35] <waifoong98> strands Kappa
[0:35:36] <ape_hawk> well, first you find the clitoris
[0:35:36] <%cureneckbeard> stranding
[0:35:37] <$daveronald> connect the two with eithernet and set slave OBS
[0:35:38] <%reonome> capture card ya dingus
[0:35:38] <+BuriasDempsey> capture card my dude
[0:35:38] <%Ipsenscastle> HDMI splitter to videocard input?
[0:35:41] <@StridentSong> Feed out from the first PC into the capture card in the second PC
[0:35:41] <leinadtonu> strands
[0:35:42] <+Clundy> Elgato
[0:35:42] <+PanicSwytch> Ethernet i think
[0:35:43] <%trustycoyote> capture the output of the video card
[0:35:45] <IminyourBase> it would be a capture card
[0:35:46] <%SWFanatic> when a game loves a stream VERY much
[0:35:47] <SilverFaustX> elgato
[0:35:47] <+Bear_Mane> Boomer doesnt understand Technology
[0:35:50] <%Agami23> is a console not just a fancy pc?
[0:35:50] <jellssssss20> With a strand
[0:35:51] <IminyourBase> YOU WOULD NEED A CAPTURE CARD
[0:35:52] <%StaceMcGate> Connect to the chiral network
[0:35:53] <%Nope80808> Get woolie to do it.
[0:35:54] <nukle0nik> just treat the game PC that plays just like treating a PS4
[0:35:54] <%Nicos143> fix that
[0:35:55] <%XeroSigmaPrime> @DriedLeafJuice So it didn't die over time but due to poor storage.
[0:35:57] <+BusterRepukken> this is sad
[0:35:57] <%HoIlywood_SN> so get one
[0:35:58] <IminyourBase> OBVIOUSLY YOU NEED ONE TO DO THAT
[0:35:58] <nukle0nik> then fix that
[0:36:00] <@StridentSong> This really isn't something you need righ tnow
[0:36:00] <%HoIlywood_SN> BUY ONE
[0:36:00] <SilverSnowFFXIV> So get one.
[0:36:00] <leinadtonu> make the streams whole.
[0:36:01] <%terribleusername> plug it into itself
[0:36:02] <%Ipsenscastle> that's what you need
[0:36:03] <%Sphincter_Spelunker> Pat will figure it out
[0:36:04] <%reonome> YOU JUST NEED ONE
[0:36:04] <derekwst3> summon the dark lords first
[0:36:05] <%Sovspot> then buy one you have the money
[0:36:06] <%MelBrooksKA> You'll have to do a big research on this afterwards @AngriestPat
[0:36:07] <%cureneckbeard> throw money at the problem
[0:36:08] <%trustycoyote> THAT is the problem. Need a new mobo
[0:36:08] <suikudo> Isnt this sort of thing your job!?
[0:36:09] <+RealPT1> sounds like you're out of luck
[0:36:09] <+Clundy> Treat the pc like a console
[0:36:09] <IminyourBase> so then you can't do it
[0:36:10] <+SolverCODO> How can this be?!
[0:36:11] <%Bt_Robot> So there's a stick and a string...
[0:36:11] <Angry_Ev1L> just OUT IT IN
[0:36:12] <DXLelouch24> Ask Max
[0:36:13] <T_Sasquatch> Imagine having two pieces NotLikeThis such wealth
[0:36:14] <%augusm> Wait really? I'm genuinely surprised you don't know this
[0:36:14] <%Ipsenscastle> then you can't do it
[0:36:15] <+SuperDeagle> You use display same on all monitors
[0:36:15] <%HoIlywood_SN> PAT YOU'VE DONE THIS AS A JOB FOR YEARS AT THIS POINT
[0:36:15] <IminyourBase> SO THEN YOU CAN'T DO IT THEN CAN YOU?
[0:36:16] <%netrac> then you can't stream
[0:36:17] <nukle0nik> then fix THAT
[0:36:20] <%PopulousNix> PopulousNix subscribed at Tier 1. They've subscribed for 8 months! Heya Pat! Hope you're looking forward to a nice christmas with the Wicdonalds Queen and Emlo. The holidays are always really stressful for me, but I'm looking forward to that stream baby next month. Take care!
[0:36:20] <SunsetJack> I would say ask Max also..
[0:36:21] <%PopulousNix> PopulousNix's Sub shared rewards to 5 others in Chat! 
[0:36:23] <+Shoosler> @AngriestPat they have external USB capture devices.
[0:36:23] <%PROUD2beGINGER> YOU DON'T NEED IT THO
[0:36:24] <Angry_Ev1L> but do you actually know that?
[0:36:26] <+PenmanLupine> then fix that problem
[0:36:26] <Aydarkzero> you could always just use a 1080/60 elgato
[0:36:27] <happyfunt1me> I feel like this is good.
[0:36:27] <42nfl19> You just need a network
[0:36:28] <nukle0nik> ...
[0:36:28] <%PROUD2beGINGER> THIS IS FINE
[0:36:29] <42nfl19> ***

[0:36:45] <nukle0nik> pay someone to do it then you fake nerd
[0:36:45] <@StridentSong> You've literally done this stuff for over a decade. You're fine with what you ahve.
[0:36:45] <segbas2004> change the mobo = get a new computer basically.
[0:36:47] <%BallerSwagBro9k> LUL LUL LUL LUL LUL

[0:36:53] <BluBox> Well, you can learn or have someone do it for you I guess
[0:36:56] <ShineTheDiamond> You can tell how angry chat is by how fast it goes by....
[0:36:58] <%augusm> Fair play
[0:37:01] <%XeroSigmaPrime> @DriedLeafJuice Unlike cars will actually degrade over time because those fluids dont last forever, and charge in a battery slowly dissipates
[0:37:01] <IminyourBase> just pay someone to build you a new streaming PC. obviously you are inept
[0:37:01] <suikudo> So wait have you been doing everything off one pc this entire time?
[0:37:03] <T_Sasquatch> I DON'T EVEN own a PC and i know that
[0:37:04] <dukenux> you can, but other periferals follow
[0:37:04] <%BallerSwagBro9k> BOOMER CAN'T CHANGE MOTHERBOARD MORE AT 111
[0:37:05] <$daveronald> record with OBS on gaming and use OBS on other pc to stream it
[0:37:05] <%StaceMcGate> Get a nerd friend to rebuild your pc
[0:37:08] <%Soulbishop> so where it would normally go to the tv it would go to the pc
[0:37:10] <%shattywack> Youtube helps immensely
[0:37:11] <MassConnect> I tweeted woolie
[0:37:12] <%genowyn> Pay someone to do it then
[0:37:14] <krymzen5> same
[0:37:14] <chronoxgp> i have a job changing mobo's it's not fun, just start from scracth with the p.c.
[0:37:15] <BluBox> Fair enough
[0:37:16] <DrFacilier> What did i miss
[0:37:16] <SilverFaustX> this is like watchin steeb clean his ps4

[0:37:17] <%maskofmichael> Cheer100 Cheer100 Cheer100 Cheer100 Cheer100 Hey Pat, I'm sorry if I annoy you with my questions when I give you bits. I feel like saying more then just "Read my name internet man", you know. If you want me to stop it, then just say so and I will and then you don't have to read the next part. If not: What do think of my headcanon that The Room takes place in the JOJO-Universe? The main character's name starts with Jo and everybody acts bizarrely, think about it?
[0:37:18] <%trustycoyote> YouTube video and give it a shot
[0:37:18] <%maskofmichael> maskofmichael's Cheer shared rewards to 10 others in Chat! 
[0:37:18] <12gagerager> You can, the question is is whether it supports the cpu.
[0:37:19] <SilverSnowFFXIV> Don't do a complicated setup unless you want to not stream for weeks.
[0:37:19] <+kevlarkoala> I changed a mobo recently and was terrified the whole time lol
[0:37:20] <Railgun5> What about that guy who changed the water cooler?
[0:37:22] <%Sphincter_Spelunker> How are you going to handle having a child?
[0:37:22] <derekwst3> @AngriestPat pay red bull woolie to do it
[0:37:22] <happyfunt1me> You should ask it why it's not willing to cooperate with you.
[0:37:24] <nukle0nik> do it with a friend who knows, they'll help you, nerds love to help people
[0:37:25] <Aydarkzero> i managed to puild two pc's and they work just fine

[0:37:29] <%Agami23> get pc building simulator on steam to learn
[0:37:31] <XelGel> @AngriestPat cpu arrow on the cpu lines up with the arrow on the motherbaord
[0:37:32] <+averagelyre> just ask LTT isn't he in Canada or something
[0:37:34] <%Ipsenscastle> if you don't want to fuck with the PC guts, your only choice is to buy a whole new rig
[0:37:34] <%Soulbishop> Okay where does the output of the capture card goe currently?
[0:37:35] <+Clundy> Just buy a new one Pat
[0:37:35] <%XeroSigmaPrime> @DriedLeafJuice Unless ofcourse you have an AIO cooler, but thats a special case
[0:37:37] <ShineTheDiamond> @DrFacilier Pat discovered buttons...
[0:37:37] <%MelBrooksKA> It's easy after you fry the first mobo
[0:37:40] <IminyourBase> stay confused
[0:37:40] <Ion_Laser> the motherboard manual tells you where everything goes
[0:37:41] <leinadtonu> give woolie some redbull to do it.
[0:37:42] <42nfl19> Using a plugin in OBS, as logn as two PCs are conencted your your home network it can work.
[0:37:43] <Big_King_Coconut> computers are hard
[0:37:43] <krymzen5> witness me!
[0:37:44] <12gagerager> It's easy once you get into it.
[0:37:46] <%SWFanatic> <3 PAT
[0:37:46] <%StaceMcGate> THE FUTURE IS NOW OLD MAN
[0:37:46] <%cureneckbeard> pat stares at

[0:37:49] <derekwst3> @AngriestPat dont look at us
[0:37:52] <$daveronald> thermal paste
[0:37:53] <+Bear_Mane> the goo
[0:37:54] <RubberFistFight> So what Pat's saying is he needs a motherboard that supports PCIe x4 for his Elgato, and his old office PC doesn't have that. So admittedly he has a very good reason to NOT jump into this right now.
[0:37:55] <%Sphincter_Spelunker> do goo
[0:37:55] <TwinBat> THE GOO
[0:37:55] <dukenux> you just plug stuff where it fits

[0:38:09] <%shattywack> Goo no pronblem. Just goop it
[0:38:09] <+TheStarvingGood> i mean you need to do the goo real bad for the dead to happen
[0:38:09] <RyanTheRecluse> If it makes you feel better my country is currently on fire
[0:38:11] <dukenux> thermal paste is the most complicated part of whole process
[0:38:11] <T_Sasquatch> Literally just go on YouTube LUP
[0:38:11] <derekwst3> can i have some goo

[0:38:24] <%SWFanatic> Chungus Elmo
[0:38:25] <Ion_Laser> you put a big dot of thermal paste at the center of the CPU. Then you're good
[0:38:25] <%cvp5127> the goo looks easy
[0:38:26] <segbas2004> thermal paste i think
[0:38:26] <%Nope80808> Its literally just a Dab of goo pat. PAt just DAB!

[0:38:32] <%SWFanatic> ChElmo
[0:38:32] <+SolverCODO> thermal paste IS scary
[0:38:33] <SGrim> @AngriestPat the goo is easy. 1ml per square centimeter. LUL
[0:38:33] <%augusm> Elmo is pretty chonk
[0:38:35] <%SWFanatic> Chungmo
[0:38:36] <Angry_Ev1L> IT BARELY MATTERS
[0:38:37] <T_Sasquatch> Just use hellmans mayo
[0:38:39] <%dumbnamettv> Pat it's super easy
[0:38:39] <+Clundy> Hey PatDad can we play the scurry game now please
[0:38:39] <12gagerager> Thermal paste is the easiest part, the toughest is installong the cooler.
[0:38:39] <%cvp5127> its like a drop
[0:38:40] <+TMulharin> Thermal paste is the tastiest part 😋
[0:38:40] <rytisone> there are probably dosens of youtube tutorial videos for anything
[0:38:40] <%MelBrooksKA> Thermal paste is the easiest part
[0:38:40] <%SWFanatic> Chelmo
[0:38:40] <@commanderclaw> Thermal paste is easy
[0:38:40] <nukle0nik> you can use something like a thermal pad instead, and no you won't harm something if you don't do it entirely right
[0:38:41] <segbas2004> thermal paste is EZ
[0:38:45] <%axellogic> The only problem is the cpu pins
[0:38:45] <%trustycoyote> Thermal paste is not scary.
[0:38:45] <leinadtonu> scary goo.
[0:38:45] <XelGel> @AngriestPat you put a half size of a green pea
[0:38:45] <Ion_Laser> Thermal paste is real easy
[0:38:46] <dukenux> you just squeeze a pea sized dollop of goo @AngriestPat
[0:38:46] <%shattywack> Just dab it
[0:38:46] <$daveronald> if its non conductive you can just slather it in
[0:38:47] <krymzen5> its super easy tho
[0:38:48] <%XeroSigmaPrime> HAVE YOU TRIED PUTTING ON THE IO SHIELD?! THAT SHIT WILL SLICE YOUR HAND
[0:38:48] <%SWFanatic> Chungumo
[0:38:49] <nukle0nik> it's really not that hard pat
[0:38:49] <%Das_Bass> its a drop
[0:38:49] <SilverSnowFFXIV> Your cpu will legit throttle itself if you mess it up now a days.
[0:38:49] <IminyourBase> paste scares me - boomer 2019
[0:38:49] <%StaceMcGate> @AngriestPat Do you freak out over hammering nails?
[0:38:50] <%dumbnamettv> You get to make shapes with it
[0:38:50] <+axenred> You forget about the custom start buttons
[0:38:51] <%Vikken141> i had no problem with ti
[0:38:51] <%MelBrooksKA> You put a tiny drop on it
[0:38:51] <derekwst3> @AngriestPat you can fix anything with a hammer
[0:38:52] <@commanderclaw> The cables are the real shit
[0:38:52] <%axellogic> the paste you just slather on
[0:38:52] <%BallerSwagBro9k> Google it its ez
[0:38:54] <+axenred> all mechanical
[0:38:56] <%Dr00_PhD> Pat's crusade against liquids continues
[0:38:56] <%MelBrooksKA> It's not hard
[0:38:56] <%trustycoyote> The paste seems scary but it's not
[0:38:56] <%Ipsenscastle> Get Paige to do it, she's experienced with goo
[0:38:56] <Angry_Ev1L> thermal paste DOESN'T MATTER ALMOST AT ALL
[0:38:57] <waifoong98> it's a paste... it's not that hard...
[0:38:57] <shabop> just squeeze the goo in there. easy
[0:38:58] <TCDerps> How bout a thermal pad?
[0:39:00] <%augusm> You never hot glued anything? its like that
[0:39:02] <%SWFanatic> Chummo
[0:39:02] <42nfl19> The worst is tthat you make a mess, unless you have a conductive one
[0:39:03] <+SolverCODO> It's the scariest because you can REALLY fuck your shit if you do it wrong
[0:39:03] <worldbrand> just use an old credit card or something
[0:39:03] <spicy_2na> Just got in. Is Pat’s PC fucked?
[0:39:04] <%maskofmichael> I just have a laptop
[0:39:04] <fockniapo> my guy charges me 30 EUR for shit like that no biggie
[0:39:05] <RubberFistFight> Thermal paste is pretty simple, actually. Most of it is totally non-conductive, so there's no risk to components - just put a healthy blob on, and the mounting pressure of the cooler will take care of ther est.
[0:39:06] <Ion_Laser> You put a 4-5 mm dot of thermal paste at the center of the CPU
[0:39:07] <MassConnect> pat wants plug and play
[0:39:09] <%SWFanatic> Chunglusmo
[0:39:09] <SGrim> @AngriestPat Sup, boomer, just buy a cpu with pre-applied paste.
[0:39:11] <Arrior_Septem> its a plasma
[0:39:11] <+BusterRepukken> is Pat actually gonna play the game or is this what we're doing
[0:39:12] <%XeroSigmaPrime> IO SHIELD IS THE HARDEST PART
[0:39:12] <masterfire23> smear all the paste
[0:39:13] <IminyourBase> i can't understand paste - angriestboomer
[0:39:13] <SomersaultJustice> he only hammers nails into his penis
[0:39:14] <smevvster> @AngriestPat My local computer part retailer will fit my CPU into my MOBO, paste included, for free with the purchase of a MOBO
[0:39:16] <%mortalitas87> just get a non conductive one
[0:39:16] <%Sovspot> this is some goblin shit
[0:39:17] <Blackscience91> You're a strange man.
[0:39:18] <Angry_Ev1L> you can literally look it up on youtube in like 5 seconds
[0:39:18] <happyfunt1me> It's not that hard, Pat. Just look into some howto on YT.
[0:39:18] <smevvster> look into that
[0:39:19] <+Tyonidus> MASSIVELY overthinking it
[0:39:19] <12gagerager> You literally put a pea sized drop on the cpu and it's done, no spreading nonmessing about.
[0:39:19] <+BuriasDempsey> easy to do, but also super easy to fuck up
[0:39:20] <%MelBrooksKA> I don't freak out over liquid cooling on my PC

[0:53:57] <%Agami23> you can read, but when it gets to your mouth you start not doing the words well
[0:54:03] <nukle0nik> why are people saying pat is a boomer for not knowing a monitor has buttons, you'd think a boomer would know that
[0:54:04] <fockniapo> Cyberpat
[0:54:04] <tactician0> pat is suffering from memory leaks
[0:54:06] <%skizzuto> cyperpunk is all about that dystopian nightmare shit
[0:54:06] <%SWFanatic> That
[0:54:06] <%President_Miyazaki> 2077 though
[0:54:09] <dukenux> Cyberpunk 2077?
[0:54:09] <%mighty_max_t> Man, Soma rules
[0:54:11] <DriedLeafJuice> truth
[0:54:14] <%NovaKnightmare> awful but cool
[0:54:15] <%AncelDeLambert> it's that whole "punk" aspect
[0:54:15] <krymzen5> ye, cyberpunk has to be grimy and shitty
[0:54:16] <+Tyonidus> Man Deus Ex so gud
[0:54:16] <dukenux> true but
[0:54:17] <%BallerSwagBro9k> Cyberpunk=Dystopia
[0:54:19] <%rumtumtugnutz> cyberpunk 2077 is gonna be lovely scary trashfire world
[0:54:19] <%maskofmichael> Star Wars is cyberpunk
[0:54:19] <Garry_Guyface> Not-Cyberpunk good future is just Star Trek
[0:54:21] <fockniapo> Pat is suffering from the thicc syndrome
[0:54:23] <shiny_prinny> I hope Cyberpunk 2077 isn't super dystopian
[0:54:25] <Kratok> 2077 Is obviously fucking awful?
[0:54:25] <dukenux> first one is
[0:54:27] <vampireinarm> @doc_ock_rokc Unite Fighting Cabinet
[0:54:27] <%thebeargoesHONK> they really don't
[0:54:27] <Mrrccava> @ballerswagbro9k and I can't wait for all the zoom in's on Pat's face
[0:54:28] <%dekkitout> Futurist Fantasy? Elaborate
[0:54:28] <MassConnect> but why?
[0:54:30] <kindashagg> "The price of progress"
[0:54:30] <%ClaudeMcGarren> @dukenux dude everything is run by a corp or is a ghetto lol
[0:54:32] <%rumtumtugnutz> Star Wars is NOT cyberpunk
[0:54:32] <%trustycoyote> It's future grimy
[0:54:33] <%AncelDeLambert> not... really?
[0:54:33] <+Shoosler> Shadowrun is cyberpunk and has fantasy elements.
[0:54:34] <zamzoph> Ghost in the Shell isn't super awful
[0:54:35] <%Engwithan_Elder_God> Yeah, it must be distopian.
[0:54:36] <dukenux> Human Revolution is more like piost-punk?
[0:54:42] <$Chimeraelite> keep in mind a big part of cyberpunk is also big crime and big authoritarion gov or corpos
[0:54:44] <%doc_ock_rokc> Cyberpunk is defined by dystopia
[0:54:45] <worldbrand> people think night city is going to be not awful???

[0:54:51] <%doc_ock_rokc> and Startrek is a bit much
[0:54:52] <nukle0nik> ghost in the shell is post-cyberpunk
[0:54:52] <%SWFanatic> That's right Jay
[0:54:54] <MassConnect> star trek is pretty awful too, borgs
[0:54:54] <HyperBomb21> After The Outer Worlds, I'm getting tired of "awful" worlds
[0:54:56] <Bigyin396> The punk aspect needs to be there, which implies a complete rebellion and rejection of the status quo
[0:54:56] <%rumtumtugnutz> Star Wars is fantasy
[0:54:58] <%ClaudeMcGarren> @dukenux Kreygasm
[0:54:59] <Garry_Guyface> @shiny_prinny It's going to be an AWFUL future
[0:54:59] <krymzen5> its as the punk sets in
[0:55:01] <Astaroth130> Thanks for the HahaLean @zombehtaco879
[0:55:01] <DriedLeafJuice> Cyberpunk = living in a technological garbage dump
[0:55:06] <@commanderclaw> Without the misery, you have a utopia
[0:55:09] <%doc_ock_rokc> Startrek is more a post scarcity society thing
[0:55:11] <%wjones0415> cyberpunk is defined by its dystopian settings
[0:55:11] <SilverFaustX> so its detroit

[1:01:50] <waifoong98> @Shady_Squid yes it's life threatening
[1:01:52] <rytisone> Linus and Pat are both canadian, they could totally help each other out

[1:01:59] <+Shoosler> sbfpGou sbfpGi
[1:02:01] <%honeyman18> Why is Pat dying tonight, I missed the beginning here?
[1:02:03] <$Dakuu75> @Shady_Squid it is if you believe it is... it's like religion, it only works if you believe
[1:02:20] <MassConnect> why does twitter break my twitch?
[1:02:24] <+Clundy> glitter
[1:02:25] <%rumtumtugnutz> @honeyman18 He learned his monitor had buttons.
[1:02:45] <%Ranryu692> @rumtumtugnutz oh jeez
[1:02:46] <%Soulbishop> We should totally do this
[1:02:53] <+Clundy> Not just buttons, but a setting menu
[1:02:54] <%Faustgesicht> Thanks for the HahaGoose @jarednotwithsubway
[1:03:07] <%Nicos143> I was gone for two minutes, and pat crashed again?
[1:03:12] <%rumtumtugnutz> It basically ruined everything.
[1:03:14] <%honeyman18> @rumtumtugnutz Ahh, got it
[1:03:33] <+Reco08> Hey so I don't know what the game is tonight, just saw pat on, someone give me a tldr?
[1:03:39] <+Shoosler> learned his monitor has buttons, learned that conversion cables exist, said he doesn't know how 2 pc stream setups work, and expressed fear in replacing a motherboard
[1:03:53] <+00ichi00> What’s he playing observer on console or pc
[1:04:07] <+Clundy> He’s our bumbling fool and we love him
[1:04:12] <$Dakuu75> -don't forget his fear of thermal paste
[1:04:13] <%trustycoyote> @Shoosler Excellent recap
[1:04:15] <+00ichi00> Ohhh never mind lol
[1:04:21] <%rumtumtugnutz> @Reco08 It's about a cyber man chasing a werewolf through people's brains so far.
[1:04:27] <+buttdirt> @Shoosler i mean, replacing a motherboard is a pain in the ass
[1:04:45] <+Reco08> Righteous.
[1:04:49] <MassConnect> should we tell Pat about the popcorn button on the microwave?
[1:04:54] <%rumtumtugnutz> I'm bad at summaries. :D
[1:04:56] <%Ipsenscastle> He broke his brain worrying about thermal paste application, and now he's going to spend hours in a cybermeat nightmare in front of an audience, this is gonna go super well I'm sure.
[1:04:59] <%WhereIsWill> hey yall crazies
[1:05:03] <+Reco08> Replacing a MoBo is kind of a pain if not just because of all the pin connections.
[1:05:04] <+Shoosler> @MassConnect rofl
[1:05:09] <12gagerager> @MassConnect that button lies.
[1:05:12] <%trustycoyote> @buttdirt True it's not like dropping in a new video card
[1:05:14] <+BusterRepukken> @Reco08 Noir Cyberpunk game, you play as a detective who can jack into peoples brains.
[1:05:27] <%reonome> is pat shitting himself
[1:05:27] <RubberFistFight> @Shoosler I appreciate his fear of replacing PC stuff. The first time I did it I broke out in serious panic sweat and soaked a shirt through in minutes. Even these days I get nervous and sweaty palms.
[1:05:33] <$ZechHarvey> Someone tell him about the mustard button on the fridge.

[1:06:03] <beetbo2> ^
[1:06:03] <MassConnect> now I am rikku
[1:06:09] <+Reco08> I used to be super paranoid about replacing parts but these days nah, just adult legos.
[1:06:13] <RubberFistFight> @MassConnect well you're meant to always disconnect and turn off the PSU before you do anything inside one, so that's kinda your own fault.
[1:06:15] <$ZechHarvey> Once you have to bend all the pins back straight on a CPU, you don’t worry as much.
[1:06:17] <%XeroSigmaPrime> @RubberFistFight ... Im sorry, what?!
[1:06:19] <RubberFistFight> @Reco08 in Pat'
[1:06:21] <%king_wragles> I got up for ice cream, did someone give Pat a math equation to die over or something?
[1:06:28] <DriedLeafJuice> Is he still dead? Pat? PAT? Paaaaaaaaaatttt!!!!
[1:06:39] <%maskofmichael> I just use an out of the box Laptop, basic bitch set up
[1:06:41] <%Shady_Squid> Man, it's gotta feel really good. All i'm sayin.
[1:06:44] <RubberFistFight> @Reco08 In pat's case at least, it's linked directly to his ability to earn money. He's said before that it makes him nervous because of that.
[1:06:50] <RubberFistFight> @XeroSigmaPrime what's up?
[1:06:52] <12gagerager> I actually found building my computer relaxing when i did it, and i'm not really tech savvy.
[1:07:02] <%XeroSigmaPrime> @RubberFistFight hahaha the sweat thing
[1:07:08] <Coystick> I can't believe Tap is fucking Dead you guys
[1:07:14] <%terminallyCapriciousz> Is the BRB screen being really quiet or stuttering for anyone else?
[1:07:19] <%deviljhojho_> i hope pat doesnt die tonight
[1:07:20] <masterfire23> this is the most intense bit ever
[1:07:22] <%honeyman18> I gave up on PC a while ago. just have a laptop preloaded now.
[1:07:25] <+BusterRepukken> Pat taking all his clothes off to shit
[1:07:29] <$Dakuu75> Pat holds his piss untill he's seconds away from pissing himself... it explains why he made norman reedus piss himself
[1:07:30] <%jarednotwithsubway> @maskofmichael my gaming laptop keeps overheating and ruining drives :’(
[1:07:32] <%rumtumtugnutz> @terminallyCapriciousz Fine here
[1:07:37] <%XeroSigmaPrime> @BusterRepukken Thats normal tho

[1:07:53] <RubberFistFight> At least this time I wasn't the only one that was pro-2 PC setups. Y'all are at fault here too :P
[1:07:54] <jtdobyns> t
[1:07:56] <+Reco08> That's fair, part of my job is taking apart and putting pcs together constantly so I just sort of got used to it.
[1:07:57] <12gagerager> Pat's in his bathroom naked screaming at the top of his lungs.
[1:08:01] <%Ipsenscastle> Pat are you really in the right headspace to navigate a cybermeat nightmare in front of 1000 people?
[1:08:03] <jtdobyns> Taps?

[1:38:21] <Zaphire_Saucypants> gotta be a sneaky snek
[1:38:21] <+allups> u pick this up while it was free?
[1:38:22] <grayjammer> Hey pat can you look at it again?
[1:38:25] <+BusterRepukken> yeah this is probably the games worst part
[1:38:26] <%walternatorz> this is a stupid gameplay sequence
[1:38:30] <%honeyman18> Must CROUCH
[1:38:30] <%trustycoyote> No roar to let you know he spotted you?
[1:38:30] <%dalmek> Pat watch out there's a monster
[1:38:30] <RubberFistFight> @AngriestPat the searchlight cone, that's the trigger
[1:38:33] <brosephmike> So considerate such a good view of the monster
[1:38:34] <%jiin6> Pat is good at Stealth
[1:38:38] <thealientrilogy> it saw you while you were up
[1:38:39] <+ZephynM> For a second there I thought it was Obscura from Evil Within 2.
[1:38:40] <smogslog> its a virus?
[1:38:45] <%Ipsenscastle> It's what happens when you press the secret buttons on your monitor
[1:38:46] <yourliteraldog> It looks a servitor from 40K
[1:38:49] <%Bt_Robot> Have you forgotten everything you learned in SOMA?
[1:38:49] <+OperatorPlease> it might be some internal security thing, or an amalgam of her ead personality
[1:38:50] <Coystick> it's amnesia dude
[1:38:52] <bear_breaker20> this feels like padding
[1:38:52] <korth367> this is actually kinda shitty because of hard hard it is to see anything
[1:38:56] <RubberFistFight> You've played SOMA, you know exactly what to do here.
[1:39:00] <MrSandyClaws> crouch
[1:39:02] <%Piemen99> probably anti virus protection
[1:39:03] <korth367> how hard it is*
[1:39:04] <%arcaderabbit48> So, this is really bad for visibility. You cant see very well, and everything being so glitchy makes it hard to see what even counts as geometry
[1:39:05] <hntronium> too slow
[1:39:06] <Daxalog> Almost!
[1:39:08] <+Mr_Pylon> Crouch wak?
[1:39:10] <+daver50flavour> crouch bruh
[1:39:10] <kindashagg> it's definitely faster than you
[1:39:11] <%ClaudeMcGarren> FailFish
[1:39:12] <Khorneflakes_> It's a sneak crouch sort of thing
[1:39:13] <+TheSaintJohn> try making more noise that'll work LUL
[1:39:14] <thealientrilogy> HE CAN HEAR YOY
[1:39:19] <%ClericOfSparda> He was crouching
[1:39:20] <%lordsdb> I think you need to crouch, it might have herad you
[1:39:24] <MassConnect> push the button on its face?
[1:39:24] <RubberFistFight> I'll be honest ,this was my LEAST favourite part of the game.
[1:39:26] <%axellogic> Perhaps if you cut off its line of sight to you
[1:39:27] <%WhereIsWill> do a barrel roll!
[1:39:31] <hntronium> your footsteps are noisy
[1:39:34] <thealientrilogy> SMELL YA
[1:39:35] <jellssssss20> Stompystomp that time
[1:39:38] <%Ipsenscastle> Play dead
[1:39:38] <RubberFistFight> It's a combination of LOS, sound, and speed.
[1:39:40] <thealientrilogy> SEE YA
[1:39:42] <aura_0> don't steal your co-worker's lunch or else kenny 'll get ya
[1:39:43] <%Soulbishop> Could you hack that computer you just passed to slow it down?
[1:39:49] <yourliteraldog> use gun
[1:39:52] <+ZephynM> Doing a big sneak
[1:39:53] <RubberFistFight> LEG IT NOW
[1:40:08] <dukenux> WutFace
[1:40:09] <%jiin6> Stealth
[1:40:15] <%Ipsenscastle> fuck I hate this
[1:40:15] <Charuzu> but wait there's more!t
[1:40:16] <%Valdorick> Ah, I see!
[1:40:19] <%Valdorick> He's the T-Virus!
[1:40:20] <dukenux> that got me somehow
[1:40:20] <Big_King_Coconut> this is where I uninstalled and refunded the game
[1:40:22] <yficaptions> this shit is like SOMA but less fair
[1:40:27] <dukenux> STAAAAARS
[1:40:28] <%BallerSwagBro9k> Ric Flair?
[1:40:30] <%Piemen99> sokka
[1:40:31] <%jiin6> he look for stars pat
[1:40:39] <RubberFistFight> @yficaptions actually it's perfectly fair, it just requires care and patience.
[1:40:44] <korth367> is this the shitty part of the game
[1:40:46] <%arcaderabbit48> Honestly, this just makes me excited for RE3make than anything
[1:40:49] <waifoong98> no torch is a crime
[1:40:54] <+Tacowavable> Everyone knows the hide and seek sections of Horror games are the best part LUL\
[1:40:55] <RubberFistFight> @yficaptions of course, it's specifically built to make you panicky and careless, so...
[1:41:02] <%trustycoyote> Master Willim, I need more eyes!
[1:41:03] <+TheSaintJohn> is there a lean mechanic?
[1:41:10] <%ClaudeMcGarren> @yficaptions this looks really easy what are you talking about lol
[1:41:13] <misterspotswood> anotha one
[1:41:19] <DSD24> Grant us eyes...
[1:41:20] <%honeyman18> Keep on Keeping On
[1:41:25] <%FrostMass22> @thesaintjohn This game is not balanced for lean
[1:41:26] <+ZephynM> Yo, Dynamic Range in the sound of this game is awesome. I can hear his footsteps proper like
[1:41:31] <RubberFistFight> @DSD24 as you once did for the vacuous rom
[1:41:41] <waifoong98> ah well may be no flashlight is better, because they may as well fuck it up by giving the player a shitty one...
[1:41:42] <+TheSaintJohn> @FrostMass22 someone got it
[1:41:44] <dukenux> crouch
[1:41:45] <misterspotswood> second verse longer than the first
[1:41:51] <Ner234> CROUCH
[1:41:52] <%arcaderabbit48> @RubberFistFight Rom, or some say Ram
[1:41:55] <%Valdorick> Personification of the cyber coppers
[1:41:56] <+BuriasDempsey> I think she committed a nono by stealing ocmpany files
[1:41:59] <%honeyman18> nope
[1:42:03] <%Ipsenscastle> did you?
[1:42:12] <Daxalog> Is this supposed to be a representation of the security guard?
[1:42:17] <thealientrilogy> Oh Je-sus
[1:42:21] <DSD24> This reminds me of the Matrix with Neo hiding from the Smith's in his cubicle
[1:42:22] <Daxalog> As she was downloading stuff around the company?
[1:42:25] <Coystick> Such a cool aesthetic for "dead cyborg memories" being all glitchy and nightmarish
[1:42:35] <Dementedpenguin> I swear I come into these streams at the strangest moments WutFace
[1:42:36] <%Valdorick> It tricked you.
[1:42:36] <RubberFistFight> @Daxalog its actually an electronic watchdog protocol afaik. Like data protection.
[1:42:37] <%lordsdb> it teleports
[1:42:40] <hntronium> teleport pronanly
[1:42:43] <Daxalog> Oh
[1:42:43] <%maskofmichael> It can teleport
[1:42:43] <waifoong98> He just runs very fast Kappa
[1:42:46] <misterspotswood> imagine a chubby old detective hiding his rotund body under a cubicle desk
[1:42:50] <%honeyman18> Sneak is the only way
[1:42:52] <%BallerSwagBro9k> Welp its 230am gnite lads
[1:42:59] <shiny_prinny> is this just slenderman now
[1:43:00] <%lordsdb> night

[1:43:25] <%honeyman18> Have to use footsteps
[1:43:27] <dukenux> follow those cyan tentacles
[1:43:30] <%Ipsenscastle> This is how to make your shady vr cyberspace future secrets really secure, just make everything fucking terrifying
[1:43:31] <%dalmek> goodnight
[1:43:33] <%Captain_Joe1911> apatPat FBBlock apatWink
[1:43:37] <RubberFistFight> @AngriestPat fair guess, but wrong.
[1:43:38] <waifoong98> being able to see and play is overrated Kappa
[1:43:38] <%dalmek> hell, maybe it's you, the Observer
[1:43:44] <rytisone> security officer Nemesis
[1:43:50] <ShineTheDiamond> Aren't there other views Pat can use? Like he had 2 detective modes
[1:43:51] <Coystick> This is what happens when the Matrix downloads too many toolbars
[1:43:54] <RubberFistFight> ENTER THE TRON BEAM

[2:05:42] <Hellarussian> Ghost in the Shell meets LSD
[2:05:42] <%Ipsenscastle> oh that picture on the wall is Gustav Dore's illustration of heaven
[2:05:42] <valriot> Watch it be you killing these people, and you just blackout before walking into the room and you're actually some kind of corporate sleeper hit man monster
[2:05:45] <assfordayz> Do you even leave the apartments in this game?
[2:05:49] <%Ipsenscastle> from Dante's Inferno
[2:06:03] <Guardiansaiyan> @assfordayz I a sure they didn't have enough budget left after TECHNO PIGEON
[2:06:03] <+Huderga> this game seems real artsy fartsy
[2:06:13] <%Ipsenscastle> or the sequel, I can't remember what it was called
[2:06:24] <thealientrilogy> No, not really
[2:06:29] <assfordayz> @Guardiansaiyan I figue for the level of details and all the effects.
[2:06:32] <%depressed_skeleton> Can we sacrifice Rider?
[2:06:32] <ape_hawk> "hey man, let
[2:06:38] <hntronium> He means you sacrifice and not him
[2:06:40] <%ButterMyBrisket> why even go that far LUL
[2:06:43] <DSD24> Sometimes you gotta break a few eggs before making a omlet
[2:06:46] <%TheAsianAvenger96> and what the sacrifice is
[2:06:46] <rosemon5001> goats are okay right? @AngriestPat
[2:06:46] <dukenux> Other people
[2:06:47] <%doc_ock_rokc> if it is them then go ahead....if it is us FUCK YOU
[2:06:48] <assfordayz> Like Dhar
[2:06:48] <aura_0> Griffith did nothing wrong
[2:06:49] <scoot_io> We really need to sacrifice these N-Gages
[2:06:53] <thealientrilogy> it's only artsy if you've never watched arthouse.
[2:06:55] <valriot> @angriestpat What if like, sacrifice time to watch this?
[2:06:56] <Charuzu> don't forget any synonyms for sacrifice or any waffling around the subject
[2:06:59] <Jrocy247> @AngriestPat Just like that Tweet where that guy said Men should sacrifice themselves in Mass Shootings
[2:07:01] <ape_hawk> "hey man, let's give our kidneys to xandaktu, you first!"
[2:07:03] <%honeyman18> Sounds like a solid Dude
[2:07:03] <Guardiansaiyan> @assfordayz they might not have had enough space to keep the details looking like this and have an open world like play style for later in the game
[2:07:06] <$Kenzo2000> Oh no
[2:07:11] <Ner234> The Elipse was neccesary
[2:07:13] <dukenux> Sounds like he's a week into No Nut November
[2:07:20] <krymzen5> he's not wrong
[2:07:27] <Guardiansaiyan> @ape_hawk you do it...just to be SURE
[2:07:31] <thealientrilogy> ON THE BACK OF THE CHAIR PAT

[2:08:24] <Hellarussian> maaybe shes ok?
[2:08:35] <aura_0> why the hell would you have a bunch of mannequins in a tatoo parlor?
[2:08:39] <JacktheMan18> Oh I remember this game

[2:08:52] <beetbo2> da pill
[2:08:53] <Coystick> Walk through the cyberdoor Pat
[2:08:53] <valriot> The Matrix PogChamp
[2:08:54] <RubberFistFight> @aura_0 mannequins with MODULAR TIDDIES
[2:08:57] <%doc_ock_rokc> For instance My boss said I'd have to sacrifice Christmas to have a chance of getting a perminate position. I told him that unless that chance was 100% and I was getting the 8 hour thing other fultime were getting then I will put in my 2 weeks and get christmas and Newyears off
[2:09:08] <Zaphire_Saucypants> secret shoop
[2:09:13] <assfordayz> All this apartments fell like in impossible space

[2:09:20] <$Kenzo2000> This place seems alright
[2:09:23] <stoccton> uh
[2:09:30] <dukenux> secret chop shop nice
[2:09:40] <RubberFistFight> @doc_ock_rokc the chances of them actually giving you a permanent position, after delivering THAT KIND OF ULTIMATUM, are 0.
[2:09:45] <dukenux> every shitty cyberpunk slum needs atleast one
[2:09:46] <Zaphire_Saucypants> no powah
[2:09:50] <krymzen5> konami code
[2:09:50] <%ClaudeMcGarren> @doc_ock_rokc sick burn
[2:09:52] <SpaceCatStation> what if high power
[2:09:53] <RubberFistFight> LOPOWAH
[2:10:04] <%doc_ock_rokc> @RubberFistFight yeah I'm aware of that as well I already put in my two weeks
[2:10:13] <+keyoray> @doc_ock_rokc your boss sounds like a user.
[2:10:21] <RubberFistFight> @doc_ock_rokc sorry, i should specify i meant the ultimatum THEY delivered, not yours. You're totally in the right.
[2:10:29] <+Clundy> Totally unrelated but did you know that they make crackers that taste like fried chicken?
[2:10:34] <RubberFistFight> @keyoray pretty much all of them are.
[2:10:50] <$Kenzo2000> This sounds like the crazy plastic surgeon from Bioshock
[2:10:51] <%doc_ock_rokc> @keyoray or worse he is a moron...or both
[2:10:54] <antthefool> Hi y’all
[2:10:54] <dukenux> why does he sound a bit like Mads

[2:12:22] <Rich_In_Antioxidants> Did someone already tell Pat that Odo died?
[2:12:24] <MyNameIsRasus> How many secret labs can there be in a single apartment complex?
[2:12:43] <Charuzu> depends on the amount of supervillains
[2:12:47] <%FrostMass22> Odo is regenerating in the big sky bucket now
[2:12:57] <hntronium> that's a lot of terminations
[2:13:10] <%antthefool> Odo?

[2:44:20] <OvaltineDream> he's playing beat saber
[2:44:20] <RubberFistFight> @jellssssss20 people already get pig heart valves implanted, this is literally basically the same fucking thing.
[2:44:22] <shoobieredgrave> That pig is a gamer KILL IT
[2:44:23] <@commanderclaw> You could at least give him a VR Pig waifu
[2:44:27] <dukenux> That'll do, pig
[2:44:29] <masterfire23> piggy using it's give up machine
[2:44:30] <%Chichen> DOES IT?
[2:44:30] <+PerrinIsDead> Living is best life
[2:44:31] <waifoong98> outdated VR tech lol
[2:44:33] <bearalin> This is so fucked up
[2:44:33] <beetbo2> "humanely"
[2:44:34] <Rich_In_Antioxidants> Gamer Pigs on Twitch!!
[2:44:36] <%GunEden> """"humanely""""
[2:44:38] <beetbo2> well yeah
[2:44:38] <+keyoray> how are the kids going to get organs? No one is here.
[2:44:39] <%chiluzza> BUT IT CANT MOVE
[2:44:41] <+Grayhammatter> that's fucked
[2:44:42] <+Ell1ot> wont he starve to death when his food runs out?
[2:44:42] <bleugh> morphine good :)
[2:44:43] <worldbrand> this is better than a lot of livestock today tbh
[2:44:44] <%PopulousNix> Morphine isn't cheap
[2:44:45] <chronoxgp> holy shit the pig is candy flipping hah
[2:44:45] <goddamndavid> i mean they are doing this VR thing with cows and its seemingly having positive results
[2:44:46] <%depressed_skeleton> Existence is pain
[2:44:47] <%TheAsianAvenger96> CASE SOLVED
[2:44:48] <%doc_ock_rokc> @Rich_In_Antioxidants don't call pat a pig!
[2:44:48] <BlacSoul> i disagree but do your thing
[2:44:48] <Daxalog> Its only humane because they want to to stay quiet. And not big squeel
[2:44:49] <MrSandyClaws> or just not to attract atention
[2:44:49] <%Valdorick> of course, if the organ harvesting guy is dead, then those pigs are fucked. Mercy killing
[2:44:50] <%Soulbishop> Smash all the buttons
[2:44:50] <MyNameIsRasus> AN ATTEMPT WAS MADE
[2:44:50] <+Mr_Pylon> Humane?! Why does it need to fucking think?
[2:44:50] <dukenux> so how long till it kills it
[2:44:51] <grayjammer> Yeah the guy up in the lab was goggling how tomake sure it didnt get bedsores too
[2:44:52] <+WorldsBestPanda> They're already experimenting with cows in VR.
[2:44:52] <Jrocy247> @AngriestPat This is real right now, there's experiments on Cows having VR headsets
[2:44:54] <thealientrilogy> that world the pig is seeing probably doesn't even exist anymore.
[2:44:55] <TheHeroAppears> the pig is 75% morphine Kappa
[2:44:55] <beetbo2> YOU NEED THAT MUCH MORPHINE FOR THE "HUMANE" ORGAN EXTRACTION PROCESS
[2:44:57] <+Huderga> and pat let the suffering animal continue to suffer
[2:44:59] <%Agami23> i was NOT ready for that.
[2:45:00] <%reneries> theyre doing this to cows now
[2:45:00] <%Jay_Squirrel> would you sub to that pig on twitch?
[2:45:00] <Ragnakawaii> No one like to know how the sausage is made
[2:45:01] <MassConnect> you can't spell humane without EA
[2:45:02] <+Huderga> Hooray?
[2:45:02] <pectusumbra> it's the future
[2:45:02] <%Bt_Robot> Maybe this is just me, but isn't a real world where you're miserable vastly superior to escaping to a fantasy world?
[2:45:02] <Rosy_Joan> @angriestpat did you see theyre putting VR on cows irl?
[2:45:03] <%Chichen> neither are child organs
[2:45:04] <%honeyman18> He's living his best life
[2:45:08] <%Valdorick> Russian Pigs
[2:45:08] <bear_breaker20> organs aint cheap
[2:45:09] <%doc_ock_rokc> We CAN actually do this
[2:45:11] <%doc_ock_rokc> We don't
[2:45:11] <oceanmatt> what happens when they run out of morphine
[2:45:13] <ALazo> I'd bet the bigger reason for the painkillers is that it would die of stress without it.
[2:45:16] <chronoxgp> i dunno i think i could handle being that pig
[2:45:20] <BlacSoul> GOOD
[2:45:22] <%Chichen> its ok funky beat time SourPls
[2:45:22] <Disraged> Atleast he's doing something Illegal to save lives
[2:45:23] <+keyoray> A machine for pigs. :)
[2:45:24] <jellssssss20> Was this is sons room or was the son a different person from organ-man?
[2:45:25] <dukenux> We do already take some organ replacements from pigs
[2:45:26] <%ahame94> not even close. I'd rather live a happy lie compared to a miserable reality. its a no brainer
[2:45:29] <waifoong98> shouldve kill it LUL
[2:45:30] <Big_King_Coconut> where that sick beat comin from?
[2:45:30] <bear_breaker20> good thing we can grow organs soon right guys
[2:45:30] <dukenux> like the heart parts
[2:45:30] <Jeemukun> pig organs are weirdly useful for human organ transplants, dunno why
[2:45:31] <+OperatorPlease> @ALazo absolutely, the pain would cause organs to shut down faster than it would die normally
[2:45:31] <BlacSoul> live with your choice
[2:45:33] <Dementedpenguin> @Jrocy247 I remember seeing a video or two of animals with headsets, so I believe that
[2:45:34] <pectusumbra> @Bt_Robot it's different for a literal beast I'd think
[2:45:37] <%doc_ock_rokc> back to nomral
[2:45:37] <aura_0> i mean the shit that happens in actual farms isnt that far away from this
[2:45:41] <DSD24> @Bt_Robot Yeah but can you say the same for other people?
[2:45:41] <+Silv3rS0und> @chronoxgp what if you are that pig right now, and this is all a VR sim for you?
[2:45:44] <Rich_In_Antioxidants> You either die doing heroine or live long enough to do hero
[2:45:44] <Zaphire_Saucypants> myself, I'd prefer a miserable life over a happy lie
[2:45:49] <%Soulbishop> Look at that podcast room
[2:45:54] <%doc_ock_rokc> but the rent is so good Pat!
[2:45:54] <krymzen5> seriously screw this place
[2:45:55] <%Piemen99> man the future is fucked
[2:45:56] <chronoxgp> it's worse than the pig im not even high on drugs
[2:46:01] <MyNameIsRasus> Once I had a testies torsion and the guys gave me so much morphine. It didn't make it hurt less but it made me not care about the pain.
[2:46:02] <RubberFistFight> H A C K E R M A N
[2:46:03] <Khorneflakes_> You can TASTE the despair in the air
[2:46:03] <%honeyman18> just an apartment complex man

[2:46:41] <MyNameIsRasus> Probably some weird porn in there
[2:46:41] <bleugh> could invest in some cleaning bots
[2:46:42] <+Silv3rS0und> Did Pat beat Outerworlds?
[2:46:43] <+PerrinIsDead> @mynameisrasus Yo wtf you got morphine for that? They just did an ultrasound on my balls

[2:47:15] <RubberFistFight> hahah he has nerves of steel. LITERALLY. You can't scare him Pat. You don't have the hugeness required.
[2:47:16] <Solidnick18> hmmm
[2:47:20] <dukenux> of course, acid rains
[2:47:23] <shoobieredgrave> HE SAID THE THE THING. TEARS IN DA RAIN.
[2:47:23] <$Kenzo2000> Seems like he might short circuit
[2:47:24] <+PerrinIsDead> Lost like tears in the rain
[2:47:24] <%dalmek> oh, plasma burn phantom pain
[2:47:29] <DSD24> David Tenant?
[2:47:38] <MyNameIsRasus> @PerrinIsDead I ended up losing a ball to that because they took so fucking long to operate. Shit's fucked,
[2:47:41] <Dementedpenguin> That's a lot of birds....
[2:47:43] <+Silv3rS0und> @DSD24 who?

[2:48:14] <MyNameIsRasus> Cool dude
[2:48:19] <%doc_ock_rokc> Janus could be the wolf
[2:48:19] <Gr4ndm4rsh4ll> that man has to stand in the pouring rain to just feel ANYTHING
[2:48:21] <+PerrinIsDead> @mynameisrasus Yo dude I’m sorry to hear that! I didn’t know that could even happen. Luckily mine subsided after about 10 hours of the worst pain
[2:48:24] <%Bt_Robot> Is that dude just swimming in a pool of drugs? He seemed very out of it.
[2:48:27] <%Soulbishop> Ew why are these displays so trash
[2:48:29] <VeryTricky> so the whole apartment is locked down until the case is solved?
[2:48:31] <$Kenzo2000> Time to go corpse diving again
[2:48:35] <Disraged> Dude I'd want to go home too after a shift at work like this
[2:48:39] <FstSergeant8595> Reminds me of Serial Experiments Lain
[2:48:44] <Coystick> Keep an eye on those billboards
[2:48:46] <RubberFistFight> @Gr4ndm4rsh4ll well i mean like a third of his brain got all fucked up from a plasma blast.
[2:48:48] <%Soulbishop> Who wants to see the hardware and mounting bracket under their display
[2:48:50] <shoobieredgrave> i played and beat this 2 years ago and all i remember is the final area being the spookiest
[2:48:58] <%honeyman18> But what if he is though?
[2:48:59] <%chiluzza> birbs
[2:48:59] <%doc_ock_rokc> @VeryTricky it detected some sort of nonobot shit so it locked everyone in their rooms
[2:49:05] <+Silv3rS0und> @FstSergeant8595 this is the first time i've ever seen that referenced in the wild
[2:49:07] <thealientrilogy> damn
[2:49:07] <Gr4ndm4rsh4ll> @RubberFistFight also true, forgot about that bit
[2:49:10] <MyNameIsRasus> @PerrinIsDead it IS the worst pain, isn't it? gives me shivers just remembering it
[2:49:32] <%honeyman18> What is the real time difference on Brain Jack's anyway?
[2:49:42] <RubberFistFight> LUL

[3:06:01] <%Soulbishop> NO
[3:06:02] <Ririten> Would you have rather it been room 420
[3:06:03] <%Rumbutt> I mean, obviously to FUCK a werewolf you gotta make one, Pat, cmon
[3:06:03] <MyNameIsRasus> but I don't wanna cure cancer. I wanna turn people into werewolves!
[3:06:04] <waifoong98> you will see, and it is real stupid
[3:06:05] <%ButterMyBrisket> they needed more metaphors
[3:06:06] <xshadowxx416> werewolf are cool
[3:06:06] <+keyoray> werewolf = implant rejection? Also, for the gram.

[3:06:11] <dukenux> spider lamp
[3:06:11] <DesuDesuDokiDoki> more of a whywolf tbh
[3:06:13] <+PerrinIsDead> This game seams to like biblical references
[3:06:13] <%YourFavoriteShiba> Dat symbolism
[3:06:14] <%Soulbishop> The real question is why did you jack into a dead body
[3:06:14] <kindashagg> oh no
[3:06:15] <misterspotswood> eli just wanted a wolf waifu
[3:06:16] <+Binary_Fireball> you are bad at walking

[3:06:56] <Hellarussian> hmm stinky
[3:07:01] <dukenux> This is just the rust/flesh world from SH3

[3:07:59] <+SlickRick11211> the 80s were wild man
[3:08:01] <$Kenzo2000> Dan needs a medivac

[3:08:08] <dukenux> PAUL BLART FLESH MALL
[3:08:09] <Garry_Guyface> So now your body is too synchronized with the techno bits so now you just see all techno bits as body parts
[3:08:10] <%Mottyrob> Detective Dan gonna turn into the Werewolf man
[3:08:10] <jellssssss20> @dementedpenguin no communication in or out
[3:08:11] <Dementedpenguin> @RubberFistFight Oh okay. I wasn't here for the full streams LUL

[3:08:33] <%ClaudeMcGarren> @ZephynM 10/10 cyberpunk doctors wouldn't recommend it
[3:08:34] <RubberFistFight> @Coystick "I applied my thermal paste incorrectly, and THE SPITEFUL INTESTINES took over my building. Don't be like me."
[3:08:38] <blackbaron98> I would have left when i found the head
[3:08:38] <Garry_Guyface> 69
[3:08:38] <%Soulbishop> Head canon its actually Dan from game grumps. so he wouldn't call for help.
[3:08:38] <%Valdorick> Fuck
[3:08:38] <Cptn_Turtle> What's scarier? Intestines or tangled wires
[3:08:39] <+Walopoh> seems very much to be a LIVING end
[3:08:42] <%Faustgesicht> Dude got a dead wife. He got nothing else to do
[3:08:42] <%MetaFlenn> 2083
[3:08:43] <Rich_In_Antioxidants> wouldnt it be a great twist if THIS is how the real world looks like with all the goo and the guts everywhere but wearing implants prevents you from seeing that And it's all a lovecraft nightmare
[3:08:43] <BlacSoul> year?
[3:08:46] <darcfowler1995> man this shit is actually getting to me a lot more than a lot of other games do this shit reminds me of what actual nightmares are like super confusing disorienting and not knowing exactly what's going on like dreams within dreams it's fucking chaotic
[3:08:47] <Coystick> nooooo
[3:08:48] <%Mekhet09> If pat was a policeman he's be a fucking clerk handing out mail before getting shot by the bad guys.
[3:08:50] <%FrostMass22> @firearmsinstructor Rutger Howard's son calls his dad to come over to his shitty apartment, Rutger finds dead body, and the apartment building is quarantined due to robot disease
[3:08:51] <MyNameIsRasus> do it methodically

[3:37:40] <Jrocy247> BAMBI NOOO
[3:37:42] <+OperatorPlease> because you're not expecting a werewolf!
[3:37:43] <jellssssss20> Shoulda picked Bonobo
[3:37:49] <darcfowler1995> it's fucking great this is some good fucking storytelling
[3:37:57] <%LaughingCatt> Werewolves! Thanks to the power of genetic engineering & cybernetic implants!
[3:37:58] <$Kenzo2000> Science creates what fantasy imagined
[3:37:58] <RubberFistFight> ruh-roh

[3:38:09] <Khorneflakes_> yeet
[3:38:11] <%Archphronimos> Bonobos are so fucking chill... we should all aspire to be the deviant peaceful sex addicts like them
[3:38:12] <DSD24> Your son got punked
[3:38:13] <dukenux> also this is confusing cause its his memories mixed with oyur
[3:38:14] <tigerfang86> YEET

[3:38:33] <Rich_In_Antioxidants> I think this sequence it taking a bit too long
[3:38:40] <%logoth_> Cygor
[3:38:43] <Zaphire_Saucypants> what about cyVORE?
[3:38:46] <NeroInfinite> okayboomer

[3:38:50] <jellssssss20> Huh?
[3:38:51] <tigerfang86> it's a fun word yea
[3:38:53] <RubberFistFight> Caution: may contain nanophage
[3:38:56] <+RyuchiZorro> Wouldn't he be a Cybork?
[3:38:56] <%LaughingCatt> hmmmmmmm
[3:38:58] <%torontototoro> Cyboars? as in robopigs?
[3:39:00] <thegreatsun> Trusting the memory of psychopathic killer regarding his tragic background. Sounds like how Dr. Quinzel got her career started.
[3:39:04] <Zaphire_Saucypants> cydork
[3:39:05] <waifoong98> it's observing heh
[3:39:18] <RubberFistFight> @thegreatsun in this case he's literally seeing his memories, though.
[3:39:39] <%Archphronimos> memories are EXTREMELY unreliable, even if they're genuine memories
[3:39:41] <$Kenzo2000> Not too late for that ball tattoo
[3:39:51] <thegreatsun> @RubberFistFight then again people are capable of twisting their memory
[3:40:01] <%doc_ock_rokc> THE SON IS THE GUY WHOSTARTED IT
[3:40:17] <%ahame94> @Archphronimos memory recall is unreliable, but if you are jacking into a brain Its a lot more accurate
[3:40:23] <darcfowler1995> son have become bad man
[3:40:26] <RubberFistFight> @Archphronimos @thegreatsun organically stored messages? Sure. But these are recorded on a digital implant. So it's about as reliable as you can get.
[3:40:29] <%FrostMass22> Wait a minute...Palpatine js behind it all!
[3:40:35] <%doc_ock_rokc> He is doing research to cure his mom's design
[3:40:35] <Rich_In_Antioxidants> What if you went to a tattoo parlor and tattoed your ballsack?
[3:40:35] <Cptn_Turtle> Haha
[3:40:35] <Hellarussian> o ok
[3:40:39] <%Piemen99> K
[3:40:39] <Zaphire_Saucypants> well then
[3:40:39] <%StripesUltimateEdition> ???
[3:40:41] <Cptn_Turtle> take that
[3:40:41] <DSD24> Oh nooo its game over monster
[3:40:42] <Big_King_Coconut> that's dumb
[3:40:42] <TwinBat> alright
[3:40:43] <kindashagg> huh
[3:40:43] <dukenux> Crazy Talk
[3:40:43] <Gr4ndm4rsh4ll> o-okay then
[3:40:43] <waifoong98> wat
[3:40:45] <Charuzu> sure okay
[3:40:45] <tigerfang86> UH OH
[3:40:45] <grayjammer> oh
[3:40:47] <BlacSoul> fun
[3:40:48] <%honeyman18> He bigg
[3:40:49] <%LaughingCatt> That ain't a werewolf
[3:40:50] <DSD24> I hate that guy
[3:40:50] <shiny_prinny> oh
[3:40:51] <darcfowler1995> well eat shit then
[3:40:52] <Zaphire_Saucypants> you're being hunted in the woooods
[3:40:53] <%doc_ock_rokc> WELCOME TO DIE
[3:40:55] <jellssssss20> Do you think that robo-rebuilding and lack of empathy was on dan?
[3:40:56] <bear_breaker20> "dont forget about meeeee"
[3:40:58] <RubberFistFight> @AngriestPat sound and the light cone, i guess.
[3:40:59] <%Archphronimos> Ah I didn't realize they were digital memories, I thought he was just digitally accessing regular 'ol meat memories
[3:40:59] <+Admiral_PopnFresh> Damn I had this another tab, I missed it
[3:40:59] <TwinBat> now you know :)
[3:41:00] <%Piemen99> JUST GOTTA
[3:41:03] <RubberFistFight> he got me too though, sop
[3:41:05] <FirearmsInstructor> @AngriestPat Isn't that the thing that chased you down the hallway like 20 mins ago?
[3:41:07] <RubberFistFight> so*
[3:41:07] <Cptn_Turtle> ded
[3:41:37] <%honeyman18> It was in the first ladies memories though?
[3:41:38] <+zcairstrike> The screen distortion seems to be the key.
[3:41:39] <waifoong98> you tell them, they will never patch to fix this now LUL
[3:41:46] <suikudo> This game looks like that other nonsense game
[3:42:04] <%doc_ock_rokc> @suikudo layers of fear?
[3:42:06] <thegreatsun> @RubberFistFight he got the implant when he was lil bab? And even that perception is still twistable in this game, it seem. I mean, just look at all these.
[3:42:14] <%PlainSimpleTailor> I'm grateful for this stream. Let's me know never to play this jumpscare hackery.
[3:42:16] <thealientrilogy> wew
[3:42:18] <darcfowler1995> this is way better than layers of fear
[3:42:18] <RubberFistFight> @AngriestPat it really isn't, and I made the exact same complaint when I was playing it. I'm fine with stealth sections but only if I can actually SEE where I'm supposed to go. Stumbling in the dark and just HOPING I'm going the right way isn't fun. It's the reason I stopped playing Outlast.
[3:42:37] <%Valdorick> fuck'n burbs
[3:42:38] <beetbo2> this is the beginning
[3:42:38] <waifoong98> the game they made after this is Layers of Fears 2 and boy that game visibility is even WORSE
[3:42:44] <+Ominnous> This is you at the beginning when you walked into the complex
[3:42:44] <beetbo2> this is when u first arrived
[3:42:47] <%Archphronimos> @RubberFistFight Agreed, fighting against the controls/interface ruins the experience for me
[3:42:48] <tigerfang86> oh
[3:42:54] <%Mekhet09> REPO MAN
[3:42:58] <%Archphronimos> same reason I can't play old horror games
[3:43:01] <+OperatorPlease> PAIRS OF EYES?
[3:43:01] <kindashagg> that's strong
[3:43:02] <thealientrilogy> Observer is worth playing, for the atmosphere alone.
[3:43:02] <%LaughingCatt> doodStare
[3:43:02] <Zaphire_Saucypants> oh is this the choices you made along the way hallway?
[3:43:08] <%PlainSimpleTailor> SURE IS YHARNAM IN HERE
[3:43:08] <+zcairstrike> Got to love those scare cues and you just see nothing because you weren't looking at the thing the devs wanted you to.
[3:43:09] <dukenux> GRANT US MORE EYES
[3:43:20] <Charuzu> sounds drunk
[3:43:28] <%doc_ock_rokc> oh now we are the big bad wolf
[3:43:31] <%honeyman18> Who's memories are these now?
[3:43:39] <%Archphronimos> A HUNTER IS A HUNTER, EVEN IN A DREAM
[3:43:39] <Gr4ndm4rsh4ll> was that you?
[3:43:40] <DSD24> Is that you
[3:43:40] <thealientrilogy> that's you
[3:43:41] <Hellarussian> thats the MC no?
[3:43:42] <RubberFistFight> That's Dan. You're seeing him, seeing you.
[3:43:45] <+MrGreenToS> He was watching you
[3:43:48] <FirearmsInstructor> @AngriestPat Are you hearing / seeing yourself through HIS eyes?
[3:44:04] <darcfowler1995> become self
[3:44:06] <suikudo> @doc_ock_rokc no the one he was playing the other day
[3:44:07] <+KingOfTheGeats> thats pretty neat
[3:44:12] <%dalmek> I like that the werewolf was actually afraid of Dan
[3:44:14] <RubberFistFight> but then... who is Baba?
[3:44:14] <%ClaudeMcGarren> @FirearmsInstructor yes
[3:44:15] <tigerfang86> that's cool
[3:44:22] <%RayMan799> byrgenwerth... blasphemous fools! Blood crazed... FIENDS
[3:44:23] <%torontototoro> how long/short is this game?
[3:44:29] <%Archphronimos> @RubberFistFight BABA DOES NOT WANT TO GO
[3:44:34] <FirearmsInstructor> @ClaudeMcGarren thanks that makes sense :)

[3:44:50] <waifoong98> @torontototoro not long, but I will say one thing, it falls apart by the end
[3:45:00] <%Binary_Fireball> why cant ghosts just use their words???
[3:45:01] <RubberFistFight> @torontototoro about 8 hours
[3:45:03] <VHLW> cop dad is upset that his son is a furry
[3:45:03] <darcfowler1995> oh you is Big murderer

[3:45:25] <Charuzu> b/c you've been jacking into people with neural herpes Pat
[3:45:28] <dukenux> cause its the THIRD dead body you jacked into today
[3:45:28] <%Piemen99> WHY NOT BOTH
[3:45:29] <tigerfang86> I think you're gonna DIE buddy

[3:45:32] <%torontototoro> @RubberFistFight so about one Pat stream. gotcha, thanks
[3:45:35] <Monkeyweed21> DO IT AGAIN
[3:45:35] <+RowenCleric> guy needs to stop jacking

[3:47:55] <+redrobiin> wonder how many horror games have used "gotta go get that fuse"
[3:47:58] <%Binary_Fireball> why do people think this is good game design?
[3:48:00] <waifoong98> "puzzle"
[3:48:02] <RubberFistFight> @Archphronimos nop, 7 of 9 is a copyrighted character, she can't be in this Kappa
[3:48:11] <+originfacts> wait is this a scary game?

[3:48:27] <RubberFistFight> @originfacts yes, but it's slow-burn suspense horror mostly.
[3:48:32] <smevvster> Can anyone in chat that works in law enforcement confirm that this is how crimes are solved?
[3:48:36] <+originfacts> like soma?
[3:48:40] <darcfowler1995> I think it's more meant to mess with your head then it is to be actually scary I think it's meant to make you feel uncomfortable
[3:48:48] <%Binary_Fireball> Can confirm this is how to anticrime
[3:48:51] <Ner234> @smevvster This is how FUTURE crimes are solved
[3:49:00] <%doc_ock_rokc> @redrobiin because darkness is sacry and fuses are a way to fight that

[4:06:31] <+OperatorPlease> you failed very much

[4:06:42] <Rich_In_Antioxidants> bad end
[4:06:45] <+Ell1ot> that didn't look like you passed, but idk
[4:06:45] <%Chichen> no
[4:06:45] <+shaderichter_belmont> its hard but its the only way to get the good end
[4:06:47] <RiverBirch> 3
[4:06:47] <%Chichen> its fine
[4:06:48] <+TheSaintJohn> let's find out :)
[4:06:49] <MyNameIsRasus> What do you get out of it?
[4:06:52] <darcfowler1995> Pat has done the big fail
[4:06:54] <DesuDesuDokiDoki> its fine
[4:06:54] <+zcairstrike> RIP good end.
[4:06:54] <RubberFistFight> it doesn't influence the ending guys, ffs
[4:06:59] <%ThatOneGameTester> if you want to die probably, no actual clue
[4:07:02] <Rich_In_Antioxidants> ssshh
[4:07:03] <%aishman> IT's fine, go with the bad end dude
[4:07:04] <%honeyman18> Different playthrough I guess, or watch it online
[4:07:08] <+reknownblackcat> is this the new Hideo Kojima?
[4:07:14] <Jrocy247> THAT'S the only way to get the good ending? The fuck???
[4:07:15] <%aishman> Oh it doesn't?
[4:07:19] <%aishman> Yeah it should be fine dude
[4:07:20] <RubberFistFight> @AngriestPat nope, the game autosaves afaik.
[4:07:21] <bear_breaker20> tonight i wasnt a god gamer :(
[4:07:21] <waifoong98> doesn't matter anw Pat
[4:07:23] <%Nobrev> you're not locked into the bad end chat is just dumb
[4:07:23] <%Archphronimos> @RubberFistFight said it doesn't matter though
[4:07:25] <%Binary_Fireball> better written than kojumbo
[4:07:26] <+TheSaintJohn> !Goblins at RISK!
[4:07:28] <%Chichen> i dont think it matters pat
[4:07:28] <tigerfang86> Chat is SUPER WRONG
[4:07:31] <tigerfang86> who would have guessed
[4:07:35] <%Chichen> @AngriestPat I dont think it matters.
[4:07:36] <%aishman> It's an optional thing dude
[4:07:36] <OvaltineDream> at least 3 one guys
[4:07:37] <%aishman> It's super fine
[4:07:41] <%Capta1n_H3nry> That doesn't affect the ending though, apparently.
[4:07:41] <+shaderichter_belmont> nah we're just messing with pat it just gives you hints for the last choices
[4:07:44] <Infeirno23> backseaters who never played the game LUL
[4:07:45] <%arcaderabbit48> @AngriestPat It doesnt matter, you're not locked in
[4:07:45] <RiverBirch> 3
[4:07:45] <%trustycoyote> apatGoblin apatGoblin apatGoblin
[4:07:46] <DesuDesuDokiDoki> its fine~
[4:07:49] <RubberFistFight> @AngriestPat that said, all that happens is you missed out on a little bit of context. But knowing you, it wouldn't really have changed what I think you're going to decide on ultimately.
[4:07:49] <tigerfang86> @OvaltineDream the legendary multiple guys.....
[4:07:51] <%honeyman18> Just a side thing for story
[4:07:52] <RiverBirch> Chat is being a shit
[4:07:56] <Hellarussian> you missed a Kojima cutscene
[4:08:01] <+OperatorPlease> TOO BAD
[4:08:02] <%Valdorick> I'll own to my asshole-ery
[4:08:04] <%arcaderabbit48> Oh. Well yeah, that's gone
[4:08:07] <darcfowler1995> yeah it's probably really fine
[4:08:10] <%aishman> Yeah that's super gone
[4:08:14] <MyNameIsRasus> Pat stares at youtube
[4:08:14] <%trustycoyote> It should atleast kill you so you can try again
[4:08:18] <Hellarussian> just super Youtube it
[4:08:18] <%miguelrod777> who knows
[4:08:20] <Rich_In_Antioxidants> drink ovaltine
[4:08:20] <%mh9s> it's just your son's porn
[4:08:26] <%ahame94> @AngriestPat its some info but for the way your brain work it wont change too much for you. no biggie besides the pride
[4:08:31] <%honeyman18> it is super hard
[4:08:33] <%arcaderabbit48> Its not great. It makes sense in the context of the game to lock you out, but its still super annoying
[4:08:34] <%Archphronimos> @AngriestPat I, too, hate it when you can't reload a save to just get more information
[4:08:39] <Rich_In_Antioxidants> You find out your son has a foot fetish
[4:08:46] <Zaphire_Saucypants> Pat wants to experience the thing
[4:08:49] <+Ell1ot> it's probably his "homework" folder

[4:08:54] <%Chichen> fuck it lets watch it on youtube
[4:08:55] <%aishman> One and dones are the fucking worst
[4:08:57] <LixFury> Youtube it?
[4:09:00] <RubberFistFight> @AngriestPat the most important stuff that you NEED to know to make your decisions, isn't in there. Taht's like... flavour text on items, basically. You can always look it up on youtube.
[4:09:01] <%honeyman18> Want a youtube break?
[4:09:01] <%MoraMiarty> shoulda done it better
[4:09:01] <Hellarussian> replay it tho
[4:09:07] <%GarbageNirvana> To Youtube!
[4:09:08] <%ButterMyBrisket> he's upset that he's denied lore, and it's understandable
[4:09:12] <+jjhoho> to YouTube!
[4:09:16] <%DonatelloJose> Someone link to a YouTube clip?
[4:09:19] <+shaderichter_belmont> ehh its fine just watch the youtube vid of it
[4:09:19] <Dementedpenguin> Not a fan of that, too. "If you miss one thing, play the entire thing again."
[4:09:23] <CurrySauseBandit> The reason for the lore denial makes sense though.
[4:09:24] <$TheYharnamTheorem> Local boomer yells at pixels KEKW
[4:09:25] <MyNameIsRasus> Youtube it is
[4:09:31] <RubberFistFight> @AngriestPat I completely whiffed that part myself, so I totally understand the frustration right now.
[4:09:32] <%Archphronimos> Locking lore behind a challenge is fine, locking it behind REPLAYING THE WHOLE GAME is not
[4:09:32] <dukenux> seems like the solution is to copy save files right before this part
[4:09:35] <%arcaderabbit48> The game doesn't even tell you what to do in the scenario either, so having it be a one and done is kind of a kick in the balls
[4:09:37] <%Saltmeisterr> its the same thing with the demons in Sekiro
[4:09:38] <CurrySauseBandit> So i'm down with it. :v
[4:09:39] <%R3Roundabout> Im gonna watch it on youtube now
[4:09:40] <dmtjinni> get good or go home
[4:09:41] <%Saltmeisterr> kinda
[4:09:42] <Jrocy247> That's really stupid that that's a one and done scenario. That's REALLY stupid.
[4:10:03] <Nina96> it did for me
[4:10:05] <%Archphronimos> get your shit together Bloober Team
[4:10:07] <darcfowler1995> yeah that's really dumb that's no fun at all
[4:10:08] <Rich_In_Antioxidants> just chase the taste with a carrot
[4:10:12] <%honeyman18> Yup, does that to everyone
[4:10:13] <%mh9s> it's not the best game design
[4:10:14] <Ragnakawaii> its just like real life pat Kappa
[4:10:14] <shiny_prinny> permanent missables are awful
[4:10:15] <%PlainSimpleTailor> When the game is constantly pulling visual and geometric fuckery like this, how are you ever supposed to intuitively see what will be an actual fail state
[4:10:16] <%ShogunNoonto> So here's a gameplay segment that you can fail for lore and what is largely a walking simulator
[4:10:17] <%arcaderabbit48> It makes sense in the context of the story, but as a video game you are playing it is very stupid.
[4:10:17] <Basch71> especially since the sequence came off as neat
[4:10:19] <thealientrilogy> PAT, if you stop for a second and waf b
[4:10:19] <%GarbageNirvana> Well that's unfortunate
[4:10:24] <ILoveBurgers811> Damn that sucks
[4:10:25] <Hellarussian> game over is a failure of game design dude
[4:10:52] <%Archphronimos> @Hellarussian it depends, but I agree in this context
[4:10:59] <RubberFistFight> @AngriestPat eh, it will, but it's not as bad as you think. I'm trying to come up with an apt comparison but like... ok it's like a really delicious meal that would be slightly better with some salt and pepper on it - but you didn't put them on it. The meal's still fine, it's just lacking that facet.
[4:10:59] <thealientrilogy> *PAT GO WATCH IT ON YT, WE WON'T EVEN BE MAD
[4:11:01] <Infeirno23> i mean gameplay wise that is pretty annoying but would a antivirus give you instructions in bypassing it?
[4:11:26] <RubberFistFight> ah damnit LUL Alright sorry man i'll stop.
[4:11:33] <FirearmsInstructor> @RubberFistFight shit's bland, yo ;(
[4:11:33] <RiverBirch> Chat, stop goofin
[4:11:34] <darcfowler1995> yeah he can go YouTube it but that's not the point
[4:11:35] <+originfacts> im at work
[4:11:36] <%arcaderabbit48> @Hellarussian The funny thing is, I'd unironically say its the opposite here. A game over would have been preferred. Permanently missable content is a failure of the game design
[4:11:36] <spicy_2na> Are those mug shots the game devs?
[4:11:38] <%honeyman18> It was a bad design choice honeslty
[4:11:40] <misterspotswood> lol
[4:11:42] <Ririten> I also hate missable content
[4:11:43] <+originfacts> and it they called me away cause i forgot stuff
[4:11:43] <Jrocy247> Agreed
[4:11:49] <Nina96> damn
[4:11:49] <+keyoray> agreed
[4:11:49] <waifoong98> LUL
[4:11:49] <+originfacts> and im on my last brek
[4:11:49] <+Splatterfest> shit what i miss
[4:11:53] <+originfacts> better make it good pat
[4:11:53] <Zaphire_Saucypants> What's best for a game's story/theme is not necessarily what's good for the player's experience.
[4:11:56] <+originfacts> jk love you
[4:11:56] <%aishman> Which is a shame cause the game clearly cares about the story it's telling A LOT
[4:11:56] <%torontototoro> yo @AngriestPat it's my birthday! can I get a well wish from my fav smol apatBig streamer man?

[4:11:58] <lujme> its a fart in a hurricane hows that
[4:12:01] <+OperatorPlease> okay, now you're succumbing to goblins
[4:12:01] <%GarbageNirvana> Pat Reviews At
[4:12:03] <%aishman> And making any bit of that story be a one and done is pretty shit
[4:12:04] <shiny_prinny> missable content at what seems like the end of the game too
[4:12:04] <%Valdorick> Apperantly, its litteraly unwinable anyway? Like, the car is suppose to kill you.
[4:12:07] <$TheYharnamTheorem> B I G fomo.
[4:12:09] <+conradical> i get you pat
[4:12:10] <RubberFistFight> Don't get me wrong, I hate it too and spent a few minutes railing against the stupidity. At least give us a replay option, damnit.
[4:12:11] <+RyuchiZorro> Well.. when people play through it again to get all the achieves, they'll have something fun to do. :P
[4:12:11] <worldbrand> Honestly, I didnt think highly of the sequence even done right
[4:12:12] <+conradical> shit sucks
[4:12:13] <%torontototoro> thanks! apatDab
[4:12:13] <BlacSoul> feels fair but really unpleasant
[4:12:14] <+zcairstrike> @Splatterfest Pat got plastered by the minigames so he missed story that he can't go back to get.
[4:12:14] <%ShogunNoonto> Pat that's like giving cup had a bed review because you couldn't complete the tutorial
[4:12:17] <Hellarussian> @arcaderabbit48 i agree, but i never miss an opportunity for a David Cage reference
[4:12:19] <+keyoray> if the player can't experience the story....
[4:12:23] <+Ell1ot> birds
[4:12:23] <%PlainSimpleTailor> We need more automatic point docking, like for ESCORT MISSIONS
[4:12:25] <%Mottyrob> The Stinx
[4:12:25] <+originfacts> it looks like shit
[4:12:27] <+originfacts> lol
[4:12:30] <illTemperedSeaBass> @rubberfistfight It shouldn't need to be explained how getting the salt and pepper shakers SPIKED OUT OF YOUR HANDS objectively and universally detracts from the experience.
[4:12:36] <darcfowler1995> yeah that's not the same
[4:12:42] <+Splatterfest> we should tease Pat more about this
[4:12:42] <%torontototoro> Pat's a pro game journalist now Kappa
[4:12:43] <beetbo2> The issue was that it locked you out, not that it was tough
[4:12:45] <Nina96> thats not super not the same
[4:12:46] <+originfacts> imagine this had the far cry3/4 intro
[4:12:48] <Jrocy247> The Cuphead Tutorial doesn't LOCK YOU OUT THE GAME
[4:12:48] <%StripesUltimateEdition> CHAT SUCKS, ME INCLUDED
[4:12:49] <+MisterRockett> Ha funny I just got Cuphead
[4:12:51] <RubberFistFight> @illTemperedSeaBass oh I'm not saying he shouldn't feel bad. I agree with his position.
[4:12:52] <bleugh> it said don't log in....
[4:12:53] <+originfacts> like not do something and complete game
[4:12:54] <+MrGreenToS> Nothing really missed out Pat, don't worry. FistFight making it sounds like your missing out. NO MATTER WHAT, you'll fail that head stuff
[4:12:57] <Infeirno23> yeah that is a terrible comparison
[4:12:58] <+MisterRockett> Beppi is a FUCK
[4:13:00] <tigerfang86> that's super not the same as cuphead Chat guy
[4:13:01] <%aishman> @AngriestPat It sucks hard because, for a game that clearly cares about its story and world, to have any of it locked away at a one and done situation is utter shit
[4:13:02] <+shaderichter_belmont> ok this place is fucked
[4:13:02] <DSD24> Ah yes the music
[4:13:02] <+conradical> it's the same shit as non-repeating timed events like in MHW
[4:13:03] <%doc_ock_rokc> this is where people UPLOAD themselves
[4:13:03] <Charuzu> cool cyber-church
[4:13:03] <+Ell1ot> if you can't get past that jump part, then doesn't stop you from playing the game?
[4:13:07] <worldbrand> take me to cyber church
[4:13:08] <%MoraMiarty> theres stuff in dark souls you cant catch on a first pass, its not exactly a new concept
[4:13:08] <%LaughingCatt> nope nope nope
[4:13:10] <Nina96> ok then
[4:13:11] <Basch71> GitS as fuck music
[4:13:12] <+conradical> better do it or get fucked
[4:13:13] <%ButterMyBrisket> half of chat doesn't get it LUL
[4:13:14] <%Archphronimos> Yeah that's not a great analogy... locking content behind multiple playthroughs WITHOUT SIGNPOSTING THAT FROM THE START is shitty design
[4:13:14] <darcfowler1995> everybody sucks the human race sucks but we suck together wait a minute that doesn't sound right
[4:13:16] <Rich_In_Antioxidants> after being straight up horror it feels like the game's trying to act like it's Deus Ex
[4:13:17] <thealientrilogy> PAT, seriously I'd rather you watch it on YouTube than it leave a bad taste in your mouth for the rest of the LP, this part is SUPER IMPORTANT.
[4:13:18] <%Valdorick> And if you glitch the game and don't die at the car, the game itself (as in, Observer, not adam's head) glitches the fuck out, you fall out of bounds, and then get kicked out to the adam's head scene.
[4:13:18] <%ClaudeMcGarren> @MrGreenToS lol your still missing the point
[4:13:20] <+originfacts> what is this considered
[4:13:21] <FirearmsInstructor> @RubberFistFight night man, later
[4:13:24] <tigerfang86> :)
[4:13:26] <Nina96> the baby
[4:13:27] <%honeyman18> Kitty
[4:13:28] <+jjhoho> I actually can't find anything on YouTube that's much different from how pat did it
[4:13:30] <Djinnazz> Thanks for the HahaShrugMiddle @tredecian
[4:13:31] <%Wallabri> hello elmo

[4:13:35] <+originfacts> cyberpunk or like some weird tech matrix bullshit
[4:13:35] <+MrGreenToS> I've beaten this game twice, what do YOU mean Claude?
[4:13:39] <RubberFistFight> @MrGreenToS Actually I was trying to say he WASN'T really missing out, but ok, distort what I'm saying, it's fine. You forget, I've played this too, and the same thing happened to me, so I know exactly how it feels when that shit happens.
[4:13:40] <%Archphronimos> well duh, his name is ADAM for christsakes
[4:13:40] <mayorrev> elmo!!!
[4:13:45] <mayorrev> Look at elmooooo

[4:13:48] <tigerfang86> well uh
[4:13:54] <+OperatorPlease> @AngriestPat i'm actually looking it up, and there's no way to not die there?

[4:14:09] <Hellarussian> gosh bless u
[4:14:11] <Nina96> no hesitation LUL
[4:14:12] <+jjhoho> this seems like A HORRIBLE idea

[4:14:28] <tigerfang86> DEATH FOREST WEW
[4:14:29] <darcfowler1995> well this is different
[4:14:29] <Ner234> Why is this fucked?
[4:14:34] <Jrocy247> I don't understand why some people in Chat don't understand why a One and Done scenario like that is completely okay to miss, when he actually wants to see it for himself minus Youtube
[4:14:36] <%Binary_Fireball> get jesus'd
[4:14:36] <Ner234> Oh?
[4:14:37] <dukenux> Neuron forest

[4:14:44] <ovan20> Elmo is watching too rooAww
[4:14:45] <luckyifpurple> Elmo likes this forest though
[4:14:45] <+OperatorPlease> i'm getting The Void vibes from this
[4:14:46] <worldbrand> if it's shiny, it can't be bad!

[4:14:52] <DesuDesuDokiDoki> brain
[4:14:52] <+MrGreenToS> in the end don't worry, only missed out an achievement for having less points
[4:14:57] <%Capta1n_H3nry> Holy shit it is the brain
[4:15:00] <%honeyman18> it's a place to hook up to meditate I guess?
[4:15:02] <darcfowler1995> well I had Apple Motif so Garden of Eden
[4:15:02] <Camail> stop all the downloadin'
[4:15:03] <worldbrand> stop all the downloadin
[4:15:05] <VeryTricky> STOP ALL DA DOWNLOADIN
[4:15:05] <APhotoOfPochitaro> elmo look giant compared to pat
[4:15:07] <beetbo2> he's a ghost without a shell
[4:15:07] <+originfacts> ok this is like soma
[4:15:09] <+keyoray> elmo so cute
[4:15:16] <FirearmsInstructor> @RubberFistFight yeah I'm tapped. Had a long day. Got a lot to do. Didn't see the first part of the stream and I want to watch from the beginning and not watch the end before I see the beginning.
[4:15:17] <%depressed_skeleton> elmo IS giant
[4:15:19] <+Splatterfest> HAai Elmo
[4:15:20] <Charuzu> upload confirmed
[4:15:21] <dukenux> "I didnt raise a computer!"
[4:15:22] <tigerfang86> I'M UPLOADED TO THE CLOUD DAD
[4:15:27] <+Ell1ot> is this the guy that was just a head?
[4:15:36] <DSD24> "What's my son's name?"
[4:15:36] <%torontototoro> apatWink seems very into the stream
[4:15:51] <tigerfang86> usedFeels
[4:15:53] <darcfowler1995> Elmo is the best baby boy sipsipElmo
[4:16:04] <%Mekhet09> This world is fucked.
[4:16:14] <BusterBazz> Pat Staring at the Observer is like someone watching the Watcher
[4:16:15] <%SaigenSolaris> apatWink apatWink
[4:16:17] <%torontototoro> Chiron...Chiral. omg we never left genius Kojumbo's game!
[4:16:24] <RubberFistFight> @OperatorPlease I think it's based on points or something, IDK. Personally I'm with Pat on this, I've no desire to replay the game just to do that shit all over again. I get what they were going for with it, but it's just a fuckin dirty trick. There's no reason you can't jack in repeatedly til you get it right, except that the game decides to tell you no.
[4:16:28] <tigerfang86> THE CLOUD
[4:16:29] <DSD24> That sounds terrible
[4:16:31] <waifoong98> Bad ideaaaaa
[4:16:31] <%walternatorz> we're soma now
[4:16:32] <dukenux> Who observes the observers?
[4:16:34] <tigerfang86> I'M THE CLOUD DAD
[4:16:36] <+originfacts> I am surprised pat hasnt bought into betterttv
[4:16:39] <Camail> brain transfers? bleh
[4:16:40] <misterspotswood> deus ex
[4:16:43] <MyNameIsRasus> Beyond Human?
[4:16:44] <%Valdorick> Bitch Transhumanism. That's not perfect robot bodies at all.
[4:16:44] <%torontototoro> "old man yells at cloud"
[4:16:44] <+Scevda> Any chance for league tonight?
[4:16:48] <BusterBazz> Elmo a cute
[4:16:51] <dukenux> Nah dad, it's the singularity, you wouldn't get it.
[4:16:51] <%Mekhet09> Oh man
[4:16:54] <%Archphronimos> consciousness immortality in the cloud
[4:16:55] <+shaderichter_belmont> that sounded like a threat
[4:16:57] <+originfacts> lol that cat is just watching the game
[4:16:57] <Charuzu> I mean it doesn't *have* to be a nightmare
[4:16:58] <%Faustgesicht> I literally just watched this episode of Star Trek TNG
[4:17:01] <%GarbageNirvana> So were you the bad dad
[4:17:05] <%miguelrod777> Ominous
[4:17:07] <RubberFistFight> @AngriestPat so remember the audio log you found from Adam, in the chop-shop, talking about the "subjects" he was making?
[4:17:09] <%Nobrev> beautiful
[4:17:09] <%maskofmichael> Pat is playing a man who hates Pat's Dream
[4:17:10] <darcfowler1995> son is Badman
[4:17:11] <DSD24> "BUT I HAD TOO"
[4:17:19] <tigerfang86> IT WAS FOR THE CLOUD
[4:17:38] <APhotoOfPochitaro> NOOO! Elmo has left the stream!
[4:17:39] <%Mekhet09> Man.
[4:17:42] <%doc_ock_rokc> GHOST
[4:17:45] <beetbo2> GHOST
[4:17:46] <BlacSoul> GHOST
[4:17:54] <VeryTricky> 👻
[4:17:55] <dukenux> this... ghost... in this sort of shell
[4:17:59] <Jrocy247> *Elmo has logged out*
[4:18:01] <%Nobrev> OHHHH GHOST IN THE SHELL
[4:18:02] <%honeyman18> Yeah that sounds real
[4:18:02] <darcfowler1995> well then aren't you just a copy you're not really still alive
[4:18:07] <DSD24> The internet is haunted
[4:18:08] <+originfacts> TPcrunchyroll
[4:18:09] <%Valdorick> Oh... so it was the T-Virus
[4:18:14] <+TheSaintJohn> release the ghost man!
[4:18:16] <RubberFistFight> this is the horror-story version of digital "immortality"
[4:18:18] <Hellarussian> that sounds like a super trap
[4:18:24] <konarius> but this is not internets and servers work
[4:18:25] <+zcairstrike> Yeah, his son is definitely evil.
[4:18:25] <+originfacts> I just realized theres a crunchyroll emote TPcrunchyroll
[4:18:26] <tigerfang86> FREE YOUR GHOST SON
[4:18:33] <konarius> how
[4:18:36] <waifoong98> hurdur become one
[4:18:43] <%Archphronimos> @RubberFistFight that's the vibe I'm getting as well, reminds me of SOMA
[4:18:47] <darcfowler1995> this is no longer his son this is just a really good like copy AI
[4:19:06] <konarius> thank you captain obvious
[4:19:08] <RubberFistFight> @darcfowler1995 well it's a 1:1 copy of him. But you're right, it's not his son.
[4:19:29] <%Archphronimos> A perfect echo is still an echo
[4:19:32] <+MrGreenToS> kinda like star trek
[4:19:35] <%Archphronimos> :(
[4:19:39] <darcfowler1995> but to be perfectly honest his son was still probably evil anyways
[4:19:48] <Rich_In_Antioxidants> If you were to transfer a consciousness into a virtual net, does that also include their emotions?
[4:19:49] <+zcairstrike> Depends on the way the mind uploading works in this setting. Is it an ongoing shift to digital? A hard copy?
[4:19:49] <%doc_ock_rokc> @RubberFistFight it might not be an exact 1to 1 coppy though
[4:19:54] <Rich_In_Antioxidants> Would they be able to feel?
[4:19:55] <DesuDesuDokiDoki> "transferred" or just a copy???
[4:19:56] <tigerfang86> @Archphronimos you can't hug your son when he's in the clooouuuuuuuddddddd
[4:19:58] <%torontototoro> I love the MC's voice. I wonder how good the voice acting is in the Polish version.... I'm assuming there's a Polish version at least
[4:20:04] <bear_breaker20> man fuck it sucks not seeing his sons research
[4:20:06] <%mh9s> he do screm
[4:20:07] <+Aullama> CoolCat

[4:20:14] <tigerfang86> LUL
[4:20:16] <Ion_Laser> sipsipHellmo
[4:20:20] <+originfacts> jesus fucking christ the chat is debating star trek @AngriestPat
[4:20:20] <%Nobrev> now we're getting into the "is your consciousness really you if removed from your body?" conundrum
[4:20:21] <%miguelrod777> apatPorgmo
[4:20:22] <DesuDesuDokiDoki> ..
[4:20:24] <Charuzu> @Rich_In_Antioxidants if it is shaped like a human mind/brain? Then probably yes
[4:20:29] <konarius> well are you sure you are the same person that wakes up every morning?
[4:20:38] <Nina96> @AngriestPat is omikron still the worst game u ever played?
[4:21:07] <Flarepulse> this is your Velvet Room
[4:21:10] <tigerfang86> SICK
[4:21:11] <+zcairstrike> ...But why, though?
[4:21:11] <Rich_In_Antioxidants> My point is that if one were to copy or transfer a consciousness into a virtual form it can be argued that it's not a person since it's missing many components such as emotion
[4:21:12] <darcfowler1995> that's cool
[4:21:13] <bleugh> nyannDab brb ascending humanity by coåying my brain into a computer
[4:21:15] <dukenux> hello 2001
[4:21:17] <%Nobrev> monkaS
[4:21:17] <%torontototoro> look at this 2001 space odyssey shiiit
[4:21:18] <%Archphronimos> well, considering we're just now starting to understand and look at the enteric nervous system and how it's basically a second little brain distributed throughtout your abdomen... I'd say we're not yet at the point where we could REALLY fully transfer a human conscousness
[4:21:20] <Hellarussian> thats an x-men room
[4:21:20] <+zcairstrike> Like, there is no point to that shit.
[4:21:22] <%IMDRanged> Pat's Lonly Shitstorm continues
[4:21:28] <%honeyman18> Time to hack Chyron
[4:21:33] <%torontototoro> hi HAL
[4:21:35] <asurite_warrior> why does the secret base need to be stylish?
[4:21:35] <%walternatorz> she gets around.
[4:21:36] <%depressed_skeleton> happy
[4:21:37] <darcfowler1995> so this is the secret room where Pat keeps the chocolates
[4:21:38] <tigerfang86> :)
[4:21:43] <DesuDesuDokiDoki> :)
[4:21:47] <grayjammer> :)
[4:21:49] <%Archphronimos> @Rich_In_Antioxidants emotions are just neuro-hormonal interactions, same as thoughts, we just understand them even less
[4:21:51] <%depressed_skeleton> :)
[4:21:51] <joylent_blue> :)
[4:21:54] <+originfacts> :)
[4:21:59] <Charuzu> @Rich_In_Antioxidants but emotions aren't magical. They're just another form of thought
[4:22:07] <+originfacts> "real"
[4:22:12] <%honeyman18> Isnt it!
[4:22:15] <waifoong98> ya sure?
[4:22:30] <DSD24> They die in this building
[4:22:31] <+originfacts> well he aint living
[4:22:31] <tigerfang86> oh great
[4:22:37] <Hellarussian> hey guy
[4:22:39] <%ShogunNoonto> sure
[4:22:43] <Rich_In_Antioxidants> hormones require chemicals combined with neural networks. In a virtual world you wouldn't have that it's just 1's and 0's
[4:22:48] <%patriotrenegade> @angriestpat shit man you still streaming
[4:22:50] <+Ell1ot> what?
[4:22:50] <%GarbageNirvana> And then it got worse
[4:22:50] <tigerfang86> NANOPHAGE AND YOUUU
[4:22:52] <Jrocy247> WELP
[4:22:53] <+spiegelspike> super cancer
[4:22:53] <+OperatorPlease> was he eating his own fucking arm
[4:22:53] <thealientrilogy> shit
[4:22:54] <%LaughingCatt> Nanites eatin ya
[4:22:56] <DesuDesuDokiDoki> F
[4:22:58] <elspiceweasel> no you just have to keep it together
[4:22:59] <%honeyman18> Nanophage lockdown from this shithole
[4:23:00] <darcfowler1995> well it's been a ride
[4:23:00] <%Volttreb> !uptime
[4:23:01] <@Moobot> I've been playing this game for how long? Oh only 4h 23m.
[4:23:02] <%Archphronimos> The problem with copying a BRAIN is that THAT'S NOT THE WHOLE PERSON. Parts of our personality and consciousness are constantly affected by things outside the CNS
[4:23:03] <Zaphire_Saucypants> remove your implant
[4:23:04] <dukenux> machine cancer
[4:23:05] <Hellarussian> nanomachines son
[4:23:06] <%patriotrenegade> NANOMACHINESSSS
[4:23:07] <Zaphire_Saucypants> keeps popping up
[4:23:13] <+originfacts> oh so theres bad guy kill you guys
[4:23:14] <$Remery_> No i need my sick robo dong
[4:23:14] <+originfacts> nice
[4:23:20] <+zcairstrike> Well, that was a good idea. Yeah, let's have a body outside the quarantine.
[4:23:20] <Charuzu> @Rich_In_Antioxidants but if it's simulating a human brain it should also provide an equivalent
[4:23:21] <+reknownblackcat> fox
[4:23:23] <konarius> @Rich_In_Antioxidants but it still can be simulated, that's not the point
[4:23:25] <+reknownblackcat> DIEE
[4:23:28] <Hellarussian> no
[4:23:30] <+shaderichter_belmont> I think that would kill Dan since they are pretty deep in his brain
[4:23:30] <JonKhan> Don't worry, your son can transfer all your memories and personality to a toilet
[4:23:32] <%depressed_skeleton> robot
[4:23:33] <tigerfang86> no
[4:23:33] <bleugh> computor is bad you guys nyannUguu
[4:23:36] <DSD24> Its lady voice
[4:23:50] <darcfowler1995> there are certain nuances about humans that would make it really hard for any machine to ever fully be able to copy us

[4:23:58] <asurite_warrior> voice sounds fake
[4:23:59] <+zcairstrike> Oh fuck, yeah, that's definitely a trick.
[4:24:03] <+zcairstrike> "Follow the light"
[4:24:07] <+shaderichter_belmont> hmmm I don't know about letting these people out
[4:24:08] <%Archphronimos> If a computer can simulate leaves blowing in the wind, it can simulate neuronal impulses. The problem is we know how leaves move around in the wind. We understand that physically. We're not there yet with the mind.
[4:24:10] <NeroInfinite> ...
[4:24:13] <waifoong98> bullshit lady
[4:24:14] <%Binary_Fireball> gotta be a tarp
[4:24:16] <Hellarussian> huh?
[4:24:17] <Charuzu> @darcfowler1995 you mean a soul?
[4:24:18] <tigerfang86> .....
[4:24:19] <NeroInfinite> What the shit
[4:24:19] <Zaphire_Saucypants> uh huuuh
[4:24:35] <Camail> why can't they just like, chill
[4:24:36] <$Remery_> She can be your mommy too *wink wink*
[4:24:37] <Kravus> Had us in the first half, not gonna lie
[4:24:40] <+OperatorPlease> what did she say?
[4:24:40] <+twohitgood> so.....do'nt follow the light, then?
[4:24:42] <darcfowler1995> if you want to call it that yeah we don't fully understand what that special thing is
[4:24:46] <%ClaudeMcGarren> you think they got a union?
[4:24:52] <+originfacts> someones having a good time
[4:24:54] <+originfacts> lol
[4:24:55] <+twohitgood> i mean both him and her have said follow the light. seems kinda fucky.
[4:25:06] <%honeyman18> This gets a little interpretty to me at this point.
[4:25:14] <grayjammer> @ClaudeMcGarren Unions in cyberpunk dystopian future? LUL don't make me laugh
[4:25:21] <Camail> nope nope
[4:25:24] <NeroInfinite> N A N O PHAGE
[4:25:27] <%ClaudeMcGarren> @grayjammer LUL
[4:25:27] <elspiceweasel> this is just a normal day in kowloon
[4:25:28] <+zcairstrike> Got to love those scares that don't really point you towards what you're supposed to be looking at.
[4:25:29] <tigerfang86> N A N O
[4:25:30] <%Nobrev> apl
[4:25:33] <autcetera> !uptime
[4:25:34] <Hellarussian> apple a day keeps the nanophage away
[4:25:34] <@Moobot> I've been playing this game for how long? Oh only 4h 25m.
[4:25:36] <%Archphronimos> spirituality seems to call it a SOUL, Freud and Jung called it the SUBCONSCIOUS, Ghost in the Shell calls it your GHOST
[4:25:36] <worldbrand> that is an effective warning symbol
[4:25:41] <+SWindleFeD> *knock knock knock* Sprite cranberry?
[4:25:46] <%Archphronimos> it's all the same thing, we still don't understand it
[4:25:49] <+Ominnous> 1 curtain, must be municipal
[4:25:52] <Schlongalong> whats this game about ?
[4:25:54] <+twohitgood> the apple of discord?
[4:25:57] <Ner234> PURGE
[4:25:58] <%XeroSigmaPrime> @Archphronimos THis + tons of other issues. Plus whats the effect of removing a mind from its body? WE might not be able to handle the concept of separation without developing serious mental illness
[4:26:01] <dukenux> IS it one of those 1200 for a bed "community" gulags
[4:26:05] <tigerfang86> @SWindleFeD the answer is cleaaaaaaaaaaar
[4:26:24] <%Archphronimos> @XeroSigmaPrime oh yeah, I'm definitely vastly oversimplifying it, you're right
[4:26:25] <%honeyman18> So like Adam claims that the corporation can fuck with his head, so does that mean this might all be in his head or is it real at this point.
[4:26:33] <darcfowler1995> I don't think any of this is actually real I think that he's trapped in it
[4:26:35] <%doc_ock_rokc> no he is a program
[4:26:40] <DSD24> I am so sick of Game Over man
[4:26:42] <Ner234> What is "real" ?
[4:26:43] <Zaphire_Saucypants> sentry cyborg?
[4:26:46] <%doc_ock_rokc> @AngriestPat he is in your brain
[4:26:48] <Kravus> Nemesis' side job till the remake comes out
[4:26:49] <%ClaudeMcGarren> hes not son literally just told you hes a program lol
[4:26:50] <tigerfang86> aw MAN
[4:26:51] <%XeroSigmaPrime> @Archphronimos We wont know until we can try this shit. If we ever can find a way to try it. And if its even legal.
[4:26:55] <+originfacts> why do i feel like im watching a nine inch nails music video
[4:26:59] <elspiceweasel> he is made of real
[4:27:00] <+Ominnous> Chiron just has Nemesis as its security detail
[4:27:08] <bleugh> what if he video game is actually video game nyannScary
[4:27:11] <hexxermanz> Maybe youre a robot/cyborg?
[4:27:16] <Charuzu> it's pretty fucking hard to tell what's real between VR, Corporate Espionage, and mental illness at this point
[4:27:20] <lesserkarl> he probably hacked your brainchip like a virus
[4:27:22] <+spiegelspike> you missed a bunch of those tiny doors btw
[4:27:23] <Zaphire_Saucypants> robocop
[4:27:29] <%doc_ock_rokc> @AngriestPat if he catches you he deletes your mind
[4:27:35] <+originfacts> what like soma
[4:27:50] <$Remery_> Chokeslam
[4:27:51] <darcfowler1995> that thing is an asshole
[4:27:53] <+Ominnous> he could hear your pill swallowing
[4:27:58] <hexxermanz> That death animation wasnt great
[4:28:00] <%Mekhet09> Why didn't you go into the second vent?
[4:28:04] <%Archphronimos> @XeroSigmaPrime modern science is getting surprisingly close the last few years. Still nowhere near being able to actually do this kind of thing, but there's been some crazy shit that's been made possible recently
[4:28:05] <MyNameIsRasus> these stealth sections are not great
[4:28:12] <+jjhoho> He's fighting back against OTC drug abuse
[4:28:16] <luckyifpurple> You fell asleep smoking an ecigarette and now your on the internet
[4:28:21] <Dementedpenguin> This part reminds me of Alien Isolation. Man that game had weird AI for the Alien....
[4:28:24] <ssebblue> just got here, is this a spooky game?
[4:28:27] <%honeyman18> Also there was a mechanic for crazy shit to happen way early in the game if you took too much sync I think. So you're supposed to question your perception of reality for most of the 2nd half of the game.
[4:28:30] <%Archphronimos> real time functional nMRI with high resolution is a big boon for researchers
[4:28:47] <+Ominnous> "strain level decreased" if you say so
[4:28:57] <%doc_ock_rokc> He is literally inside your mind trying to kill you via dysnc
[4:29:13] <%ClaudeMcGarren> FailFish
[4:29:19] <Charuzu> guess the devs thought there was enough fuckery anyway
[4:29:25] <%ClaudeMcGarren> PogChamp
[4:29:25] <%logoth_> Touch his butt to say hi
[4:29:25] <darcfowler1995> oh my god that actually worked
[4:29:27] <+zcairstrike> Kek, I think he bugged out.
[4:29:28] <Basch71> deaf as fuck

[4:29:44] <tigerfang86> that's a good bit
[4:29:57] <tigerfang86> 👁️
[4:30:00] <ssebblue> wtf is this game?
[4:30:11] <Axle13j> a class? WutFace
[4:30:15] <+OperatorPlease> oh is this supposed to be "premium" homes?
[4:30:19] <+zcairstrike> Yeah, the fact he keeps teleporting should be a dead giveaway that this is bullshit.
[4:30:24] <Axle13j> also just showed up wtf is this
[4:30:34] <+jjhoho> in game caste system, a b and c classes
[4:30:36] <%Faustgesicht> Thank god that wasn't cake or I'd be pissed
[4:30:41] <Axle13j> lol
[4:30:45] <%doc_ock_rokc> @Axle13j a cyberpunk hospital apparently
[4:30:45] <DesuDesuDokiDoki> PAT
[4:30:54] <%XeroSigmaPrime> @Archphronimos Not to be a pessimistic asshole, but people have been saying the same for nuclear fusion. But maybe someday
[4:30:55] <Axle13j> sick
[4:30:55] <%Archphronimos> @Axle13j Observer, a neo-noir cyberpunk walking simulator horror game by the people who made Layers of Fear
[4:31:04] <Dementedpenguin> Oh god, this is making me tense. I'm not even playing >_>
[4:31:18] <darcfowler1995> butthole super clenched
[4:31:18] <+jjhoho> I had to switch to watching on my phone
[4:31:21] <%honeyman18> Yeah, this game is great but they really want you to replay to catch weird shit and alternate bits. it's way better to finish then YouTube the missing bits.
[4:31:23] <%doc_ock_rokc> It has a bit more mechanics then a walking sym
[4:31:24] <thealientrilogy> so, A class is being taken and put in, these things?
[4:31:26] <Axle13j> WutFace
[4:31:29] <%aishman> Almost
[4:31:30] <Rich_In_Antioxidants> can you not run
[4:31:40] <hexxermanz> oh, its one of these kinds of horror games
[4:31:41] <+jjhoho> cus I'm such a pussy that full screen and headphones fucked me up
[4:31:41] <%aishman> @Rich_In_Antioxidants That was him running
[4:31:45] <Axle13j> thnx gonna look more into this
[4:31:45] <Rich_In_Antioxidants> wooooow
[4:31:46] <+jjhoho> nah he's faster
[4:31:50] <ssebblue> @Archphronimos thanks for the info. was hella confused
[4:31:54] <Dementedpenguin> LUL
[4:31:55] <waifoong98> yawnnn
[4:31:58] <ILoveBurgers811> Seems that way
[4:32:00] <darcfowler1995> yeah they suck pretty bad seems like
[4:32:00] <spicy_2na> The monster looks like the enemies from Mass Effect
[4:32:01] <%Nobrev> yup
[4:32:02] <@commanderclaw> Stealth sequences in non stealth games?
[4:32:02] <shiny_prinny> yeah if this was all investigation it would be better maybe
[4:32:04] <+twohitgood> i think i had the "fuck it, book it" reaction the same moment you did.
[4:32:07] <MyNameIsRasus> It's the exact same problem as Soma
[4:32:08] <Dementedpenguin> They seem..... not great
[4:32:11] <Ids560> yeah it seems very similar to soma
[4:32:12] <DSD24> I don't like that its the same guy too
[4:32:16] <%aishman> They really aren't
[4:32:17] <%Archphronimos> @XeroSigmaPrime not a bad analogy, but, for example, there was a study a few years ago that, with fMRI and machine learning, the researchers could get a VERY rough outline of what the study subjects were literally seeing. Like they'd show them a picture of an elephant, and the computer would spit out a roughly elephant shaped blob
[4:32:17] <RubberFistFight> The first one is fine but holy shit do they fall apart after that
[4:32:18] <%ClaudeMcGarren> @thealientrilogy that thing is a program i think A class is being taken and used to maybe find a cure for the phage
[4:32:19] <tigerfang86> stealth in non stealth games is bad???? I'm shocked
[4:32:21] <%torontototoro> soma-ler
[4:32:23] <%aishman> It's probably the worst thing about the game
[4:32:26] <darcfowler1995> they're my least favorite part of this game haven't played it though
[4:32:27] <%honeyman18> They thought it was spooky I guess, but I thought the subject matter was spookier.
[4:32:32] <jobbedbone> whats with the blue guy
[4:32:33] <+TomDanksEGOT> they look pretty atrocious
[4:32:39] <+zcairstrike> Soma's stealth sequences were WAY better because they had different rules for each monster.
[4:32:39] <%shattywack> Pretty sure this is the part I stopped playing the game however many years ago that was
[4:32:54] <tigerfang86> 👁️
[4:32:57] <Dementedpenguin> Nice
[4:32:57] <+zcairstrike> They weren't good, but better than generic line of sight lad.
[4:33:00] <+jjhoho> maximum of two @shattywack
[4:33:01] <%Faustgesicht> how old is this game?
[4:33:06] <Basch71> investigative psychological techno horror is its better strong point than sneak pass the bad man
[4:33:09] <+jjhoho> 2017
[4:33:09] <+KingOfTheGeats> you did it
[4:33:12] <RubberFistFight> @AngriestPat the biggest problem is they don't make it clear where you're supposed to be going, add to that the visibility issues you had in the earlier one and yeah, they really land like a ton of bricks.
[4:33:23] <%Faustgesicht> huh
[4:33:33] <%shattywack> @jihoho Sounds about right
[4:33:34] <tigerfang86> ok

[4:34:40] <luckyifpurple> Damn Son they infected your computer with the T virus
[4:34:40] <+ELITIDUS> Man I both love and hate the audio design in this game, it's too spooky.
[4:34:40] <%aishman> Probably his wife or mom
[4:34:42] <Ion_Laser> TETSUO
[4:34:48] <%doc_ock_rokc> The sun uploaded his mom into that woman via nanophage
[4:34:49] <+keyoray> aren't you danny, daniel?

[4:35:37] <Axle13j> neat sounds
[4:35:39] <+jjhoho> what's it gonna do
[4:35:41] <hexxermanz> You just unplugged all the life support systems....
[4:35:42] <MyNameIsRasus> IT guy the game
[4:35:51] <beetbo2> ^
[4:35:56] <%ClaudeMcGarren> have you tried turning it off and on again?
[4:35:59] <+jjhoho> tbh it kinda feels like these guys have worked in IT yeah
[4:36:06] <+jjhoho> and/or AV
[4:36:13] <Rich_In_Antioxidants> are you in the jeffries tubes?
[4:36:14] <+spiegelspike> you looked past a handle back in the corner you thought you got stuck on
[4:36:18] <DesuDesuDokiDoki> can you scan?
[4:36:18] <darcfowler1995> dark scary Electric Avenue
[4:36:24] <+jjhoho> all the giant cables look just like twist lock
[4:36:26] <spicy_2na> Your son became Mr. House after working for Umbrella
[4:36:38] <Axle13j> um
[4:36:43] <+jjhoho> The House in the Machine
[4:36:43] <+originfacts> that was lazy
[4:36:44] <tigerfang86> uh
[4:36:50] <Ririten> Imagine being maintenance here
[4:36:57] <MyNameIsRasus> time IS convoluted in Lordran
[4:36:57] <Ririten> Oh we got a short in the cable farm
[4:37:02] <%Faustgesicht> I didn't know Odo also voiced Mr. House
[4:37:05] <Axle13j> their health plan better be good
[4:37:05] <tigerfang86> that's probably not a real
[4:37:08] <tigerfang86> or IS IT
[4:37:08] <%honeyman18> This is such a weird look for the merging mesh cyber nightmare.
[4:37:08] <darcfowler1995> maybe nothing was real to begin with or maybe plugging into a dead body was a really bad idea
[4:37:11] <%XeroSigmaPrime> JANK
[4:37:11] <jobbedbone> did the AI contact you or the real guy? it said the head was only dead for four hours
[4:37:13] <+BioHunter> confusing what is real
[4:37:13] <theloganbrand> Are any of us real?
[4:37:16] <+BioHunter> u might say

[4:39:22] <DSD24> Guilt
[4:39:24] <tigerfang86> oh FUCK
[4:39:27] <beetbo2> that's how she got the phage?
[4:39:28] <%aishman> GUUUILT

[4:39:50] <beetbo2> sorry, i'm lost
[4:39:52] <%honeyman18> So I want to believe that the nanophage does cause that meat nightmare shit. Between the biomass and the fusing tech and flesh it could be real.
[4:39:57] <%colouroftheiris77> apatWrong apatWrong apatWrong apatWrong apatWrong apatWrong apatWrong
[4:40:00] <misterspotswood> thats why that kid said "it shouldve been you"
[4:40:03] <+OperatorPlease> @beetbo2 he made the decision for her to not get the regenerating implant
[4:40:05] <%torontototoro> oh fuck this actually is Rutger Hauer. That's awesome
[4:40:08] <tigerfang86> SUPER KILLED YOUR WIFE
[4:40:13] <Hellarussian> he made an oopsie
[4:40:13] <beetbo2> oh shit
[4:40:21] <tigerfang86> BUT MAYBE IT WAS THE BETTER OPTION
[4:40:21] <ILoveBurgers811> Welp
[4:40:25] <DSD24> No
[4:40:33] <+SolverCODO> she didnt ask for this
[4:40:34] <+jjhoho> GUILT CUS WIFE DEAD MAN
[4:40:36] <karl_rex> WAIT what happened?
[4:40:47] <beetbo2> so his technophobia got her killed
[4:40:48] <+jjhoho> oh the flesh mass is the cancer
[4:40:49] <+originfacts> NotLikeThis
[4:40:50] <Charuzu> fucking cyber anti-vaxxers
[4:40:53] <RubberFistFight> @karl_rex his wife got sick and died, and the operation to fix her would have destroyed the person that she was.
[4:40:53] <DesuDesuDokiDoki> meh not really
[4:40:54] <spicy_2na> GUILTMAN
[4:40:55] <tigerfang86> MEGA HIS FAULT
[4:40:55] <DSD24> Daniel got his Wife killed
[4:40:57] <+jjhoho> cus she had the cancer
[4:40:57] <darcfowler1995> that's fucked
[4:41:12] <%maskofmichael> 80% his fault at most
[4:41:18] <+jjhoho> so that's all super not real
[4:41:18] <+twohitgood> 1 2 ada,
[4:41:18] <karl_rex> I get that but what does that have to do with the flesh stuff
[4:41:18] <RubberFistFight> It was completely a no-win scenario.
[4:41:19] <Camail> it's always the luddites. ALWAYS.
[4:41:21] <%Archphronimos> it should have been HER CHOICE, that's the reason Rutger Hower man is an asshole
[4:41:22] <3Xgilly> how long is this game?
[4:41:33] <+jjhoho> I mean yeah depends how much he influenced her
[4:41:42] <DSD24> noooo
[4:41:42] <+jjhoho> but it seems like we're not gonna get an answer
[4:41:42] <%walternatorz> He didn't ask for this.
[4:41:43] <%dalmek> oh that's irony baby
[4:41:43] <darcfowler1995> so he was the bad man all along
[4:41:45] <RubberFistFight> @Archphronimos well he didn't force her not to. She asked what he thought, and he told her. The choice was still ultimately hers.
[4:41:46] <%Nobrev> he /thinks/ it would have destroyed who she was because he was against augsburg of any kind
[4:41:47] <Hellarussian> BIG Robocop
[4:41:48] <MyNameIsRasus> Was he an Immaculate?
[4:41:49] <+originfacts> bicentennial man
[4:41:54] <tigerfang86> ROBOCOP TIME
[4:41:56] <%Nobrev> augs
[4:42:00] <+jjhoho> FUCK Augsburg
[4:42:04] <Hellarussian> Doc Oc
[4:42:08] <misterspotswood> oh no, survivors guilt
[4:42:08] <$Remery_> Give him the ROBO-Dong
[4:42:13] <%Archphronimos> @RubberFistFight ah I see, well then it's just my opinion that he's an asshole, not an ethical certainty...
[4:42:16] <commander_ninja> But did he ask for this though?
[4:42:17] <scenekidphase> I'd live in a jar
[4:42:21] <+spiegelspike> a vicious cycle of guilt
[4:42:23] <%Mekhet09> At least he's not a hypocrite
[4:42:27] <tigerfang86> HE BECAME ROBOCOP
[4:42:34] <%doc_ock_rokc> then he got augmented to provide his for his son
[4:42:44] <DesuDesuDokiDoki> y tho?
[4:42:45] <%honeyman18> yup
[4:42:46] <%doc_ock_rokc> @AngriestPat he was honoring his wife's wish
[4:42:47] <thealientrilogy> wait for it
[4:42:51] <Dementedpenguin> LUL
[4:42:51] <Axle13j> lolol
[4:42:51] <+twohitgood> so....does that mean you're the chibirobo and adam is screwing with your circuits?
[4:42:53] <RubberFistFight> @Archphronimos either way he was gonna be an asshole. Either he said "yeah get the cyborg in you" and who she is is destroyed, or he says "don't get the cyborg in you", and she dies. Either way, who she is dies.
[4:42:53] <ssebblue> LUL
[4:42:53] <Ion_Laser> lol
[4:42:54] <BlacSoul> Literally didnt want it
[4:42:55] <dukenux> LUL
[4:42:55] <+jjhoho> I mean yeah she kinda decided for him
[4:42:56] <thealientrilogy> WAIT FOR IT
[4:42:56] <+Ryuuken1789> LUL
[4:42:59] <tigerfang86> LUL
[4:43:01] <commander_ninja> LUL LUL
[4:43:04] <hexxermanz> I wouldnt call it a hypocrite, he was thinking of his kid
[4:43:07] <Jrocy247> Is this Crazy Talk activating?
[4:43:18] <%honeyman18> He let her die man, it was a bad call.
[4:43:19] <jobbedbone> the blue monster is you
[4:43:21] <%walternatorz> You're the virus now.
[4:43:23] <%torontototoro> you were game over man all along
[4:43:31] <darcfowler1995> oh shit that thing was fucking you
[4:43:31] <Jrocy247> YOU WERE THE MONSTER ALL ALONG
[4:43:42] <shiny_prinny> it me :)
[4:43:45] <GiygasDrillBreak> I WAS THE AS-HOLE ALL ALONG
[4:43:47] <DSD24> Me Me Me

[4:43:50] <GiygasDrillBreak> 2FAST2FURIOUS
[4:43:50] <%Nobrev> yup the monster that's been chasing you is how he sees himself after getting aug-ed
[4:43:51] <Flarepulse> I'm the maniac
[4:43:54] <%torontototoro> the monster was INSIDE you this whole time
[4:43:54] <%Archphronimos> @RubberFistFight I missed all the previous streams of this, in universe is it for sure established that consciousness transfer is actually that deeply impossible?
[4:43:56] <mayorrev> IM THE MANIAC
[4:43:57] <%Piemen99> DAT ME
[4:43:57] <RubberFistFight> @AngriestPat honestly, it's a tough call either way. She DID make him promise to look after Adam "whatever it takes", and he DID initially refuse to be fixed until they said "think of your kid, dude."
[4:44:00] <tigerfang86> IT ME
[4:44:01] <+jjhoho> ok ok that's a little unfair
[4:44:05] <misterspotswood> ITS PSYCOLOGICAL HORROR 2019 DAD IS BAD!
[4:44:05] <+Aullama> danO
[4:44:08] <+Mr_Pylon> That was very good
[4:44:10] <DesuDesuDokiDoki> ooh
[4:44:10] <+spiegelspike> @AngriestPat so only about a third or less of your body is organic
[4:44:11] <+RowenCleric> man why cant the twist ever be that we were secretly a really good person
[4:44:14] <tigerfang86> LUL
[4:44:14] <bleugh> it was the silent hill all along....
[4:44:14] <+OperatorPlease> the son didn't get to hear what his mom wanted
[4:44:15] <RubberFistFight> @Archphronimos yeah it is, there's a few examples of it.
[4:44:16] <+jjhoho> ok but the son MIGHT be a bit biased tho
[4:44:18] <beetbo2> are you ready pat
[4:44:19] <+Ryuuken1789> We're the monster, chat. doodBait
[4:44:20] <jobbedbone> life is ruff
[4:44:21] <beetbo2> this is it
[4:44:23] <darcfowler1995> yeah he's a fucking piece of shit
[4:44:25] <BlacSoul> He DID NOT want it tho pat
[4:44:27] <%Bt_Robot> So you're constantly fighting against your son's image of you.
[4:44:28] <beetbo2> the spooky digispace
[4:44:29] <MyNameIsRasus> Yeah Daniel kinda sucks ngl
[4:44:30] <DSD24> @RowenCleric I'd appreciate that if it ever came up
[4:44:30] <tigerfang86> IN THE DATASCAPE
[4:44:31] <Axle13j> doodBait
[4:44:31] <%honeyman18> Unless it was being ghost in the shelled it seems stupid to not save the wife.
[4:44:31] <Camail> hmmmm
[4:44:32] <dukenux> NEo?
[4:44:34] <+originfacts> it looks like the xbox start screen
[4:44:34] <%doc_ock_rokc> Pat he refused at first and then he accepted when reminded of his promise
[4:44:34] <+twohitgood> yep. moralizing piece of shit.
[4:44:35] <dukenux> Matrix?
[4:44:36] <BlacSoul> He had promis
[4:44:36] <bleugh> yeee oh yeee oh yeee oh
[4:44:36] <+originfacts> the first gen
[4:44:37] <DSD24> MY FACE?
[4:44:37] <+Aullama> monkaS

[4:44:43] <%moogleboy1984> Pat Stares At Lawnmower Man
[4:44:44] <Dementedpenguin> System Shock 3 looks weird
[4:44:45] <%ThatOneGameTester> Oh so now it's Like Father like Son
[4:44:45] <%maskofmichael> NOW its' weird?

[4:44:52] <ssebblue> systemshock?
[4:44:53] <%torontototoro> cloud son's just trying to get a head in life
[4:44:53] <RubberFistFight> This is an awfully dark shade of ethically grey. The whole game is steeped in it. That's the whole fucking point really, there's no easy options here and somebody gets fucked for some reason or another.
[4:44:57] <spicy_2na> They really love this song huh?
[4:45:03] <%Valdorick> Let me INNNNNNNNN
[4:45:05] <%Archphronimos> @RubberFistFight ah.... that's unfortunate. Although it makes it a lot more ethically murky which is interesting
[4:45:05] <Hellarussian> BIG lie
[4:45:07] <Jrocy247> MAN that's a REALLY lazy way to animate his mouth
[4:45:21] <mayorrev> nice workaround for doing lipsynch
[4:45:21] <DSD24> Ewww
[4:45:23] <RubberFistFight> god that face thing is fucking unsettling.

[4:45:32] <tigerfang86> oh NO
[4:45:32] <%Mekhet09> oh no.
[4:45:34] <%PlainSimpleTailor> This type of twist is almost always unfair. They always point at the PLAYER and try to get THEM to feel like THEY'RE the bad guy. FUCKER, I didn't have any choice in your on rails walking simulator.
[4:45:36] <Charuzu> he...wants his dad to sacrifice himself
[4:45:43] <Dementedpenguin> Well, this family really got a raw deal in life....
[4:45:44] <RubberFistFight> YOU PULLED THE SAME SHIT YOU LYING CYBER-BITCH
[4:45:44] <+jjhoho> I feel like Adam maybe should make himself a little more appealing
[4:45:50] <+spiegelspike> @AngriestPat aren't you infected with nanophage though? swapping bodies still fucks him
[4:46:02] <hntronium> fuck that guy

[4:57:34] <Funkyguy321> youtube!
[4:57:36] <%honeyman18> Youtube
[4:57:36] <Charuzu> WHY1?
[4:57:36] <%SomeSageAdvice> either way, that body contracted the plague, so "Adam" was screwed either way
[4:57:38] <%Binary_Fireball> why do they hate people?
[4:57:38] <MyNameIsRasus> 3
[4:57:38] <ssebblue> LUL
[4:57:38] <shiny_prinny> man i hate games with all bad endings
[4:57:38] <beetbo2> YOUTUBE TIME
[4:57:39] <tigerfang86> O N E G UY
[4:57:39] <+MrGreenToS> I played PS4 version
[4:57:40] <%ThatOneGameTester> the fuck my video froze but the audio kept going
[4:57:43] <+spiegelspike> there's only one other
[4:57:43] <hntronium> He takes over
[4:57:45] <karl_rex> Thats a bad design choice
[4:57:46] <BlacSoul> Wait
[4:57:47] <%honeyman18> it also sucks ass
[4:57:47] <%Chichen> YOUTUBE IT
[4:57:48] <BlacSoul> WAIT
[4:57:48] <%torontototoro> other ending is let him take over
[4:57:48] <+MrGreenToS> So my save was still on it
[4:57:51] <%R3Roundabout> you have to go into game files and extract a save
[4:57:52] <%Valdorick> You embrace him, and he body jacks you anyway. He's a lying fuck.
[4:57:53] <thealientrilogy> Yeah, YOU just walk away together.
[4:57:56] <%dalmek> I think you just get stuck as a bystander in your own body
[4:57:56] <RubberFistFight> @AngriestPat yes. You merge with Adam, but he takes over and is like "HAHA FUCKER, THAT WAS MY WHOLE PLAN YOU DUMB ASSHOLE"
[4:57:59] <jobbedbone> you become a voice in your own head and can't do anything
[4:58:00] <%dalmek> don't quote me on that
[4:58:00] <+spiegelspike> yeah, just those two
[4:58:02] <%honeyman18> Adam kind of takes over in your merge
[4:58:03] <akaSiggy> I think the other ending is that you end up in the bot and you roll out the door
[4:58:03] <tigerfang86> he totally steals your body anyway
[4:58:06] <bleugh> it was adam like in da bible...
[4:58:06] <waifoong98> not-system-shock hurhur
[4:58:07] <GiygasDrillBreak> wow this game was made in poland
[4:58:09] <BlacSoul> EVERYONE ELSE IS CONNECTED TO THE VIRUS
[4:58:11] <%aeravon> if you let him in, he just pushes you out and wins
[4:58:15] <hntronium> This was the better end
[4:58:16] <Rainphoon> wait so the chose earlier, the one to connect with you not-son. was that actually a chose?
[4:58:16] <BlacSoul> HE LOSES ANYWAY
[4:58:17] <%honeyman18> Adam was always a bitch
[4:58:18] <%LaughingCatt> neither ending is good
[4:58:19] <DSD24> Isn't it kinda lame that he still takes your body regardless of each ending
[4:58:19] <thealientrilogy> Yeah. he takes over, so this is the good ending.
[4:58:19] <BlacSoul> YEYEYEYEYEYE
[4:58:20] <%torontototoro> "locked in" to your own, son-piloted body. ugh
[4:58:20] <Zaphire_Saucypants> Poor Janus
[4:58:21] <scenekidphase> that's kind of a wet fart of an ending
[4:58:24] <$StarlitStunner> What a shit child
[4:58:26] <DesuDesuDokiDoki> yea
[4:58:27] <%ThatOneGameTester> yuuuup
[4:58:28] <RubberFistFight> @AngriestPat so basically with the ending you chose, you still lose, but you lose on your own terms, instead of his.
[4:58:30] <Mr_Rakjo> That was the simulation
[4:58:30] <tigerfang86> YEP
[4:58:30] <+OperatorPlease> he didn't know you touched it
[4:58:31] <%XeroSigmaPrime> yup
[4:58:31] <waifoong98> ye
[4:58:34] <mage_neb> yurp
[4:58:36] <+Mr_Pylon> wasn't that fake?
[4:58:38] <Mr_Rakjo> wasnt that the simulation?
[4:58:38] <Khorneflakes_> That too... maybe that's what they noticed
[4:58:41] <Ner234> Wasn't that in the simulation
[4:58:43] <thetruenicster> but that was fake
[4:58:44] <DesuDesuDokiDoki> wait was that fake?
[4:58:44] <darcfowler1995> yep them both dying in the end is probably the best way this could have ended
[4:58:45] <+shaderichter_belmont> that was a fake nanophage in a simulation pat, you were in the pod
[4:58:46] <BlacSoul> And Chiron
[4:58:46] <+RealThiele> body hop again
[4:58:49] <%honeyman18> Shitty future for a shitty Cyberpunk world
[4:58:49] <Infeirno23> that was fake
[4:58:54] <%Archphronimos> @RubberFistFight a perfect "YOU DIDN'T WIN" ending for Pat
[4:58:54] <MyNameIsRasus> I think that's fake
[4:58:55] <thetruenicster> You never left the capsule, remember?
[4:58:56] <Khorneflakes_> ooooh
[4:58:56] <%walternatorz> you never left the sanctuary
[4:59:00] <RubberFistFight> Ok so apparently the idea that stuff is hidden in Adam's head is a fucking lie, and it ends the way it does regardless of how well you do. So it's essentially a scripted failure. In other words you didn't miss anything because what happened was the only thing that could. Sorry for giving you bad/wrong advice, that one's on me. @AngriestPat
[4:59:01] <hexxermanz> The other ending is you merge, but it was a lie and Adam gets full control
[4:59:02] <tigerfang86> hmmmm
[4:59:09] <%cureneckbeard> nyannFUG
[4:59:12] <+spiegelspike> you got some good hits in
[4:59:12] <+jjhoho> honestly Daniel seems fucked anyway
[4:59:12] <ssebblue> tru
[4:59:14] <RiverBirch> Y'got to beat your son!
[4:59:16] <%Piemen99> !uptime
[4:59:16] <Khorneflakes_> cohhOld from the grave
[4:59:16] <@Moobot> I've been playing this game for how long? Oh only 4h 59m.
[4:59:18] <tigerfang86> Rubberfistfight was that ONE GUY but on accident
[4:59:18] <RiverBirch> :D With Violence
[4:59:18] <Charuzu> I mean what else can we all hope for?
[4:59:19] <MyNameIsRasus> Should've picked up a knife
[4:59:19] <BlacSoul> HES CONNECTED TO THE NET NOW
[4:59:19] <waifoong98> u got some good hits in tho LUL
[4:59:20] <+originfacts> the bad ending is that you get controlled and stuck watching him do stuff with your body @AngriestPat
[4:59:20] <ssebblue> !uptime
[4:59:23] <%ButterMyBrisket> yeah you showed him pat
[4:59:24] <%WhereIsWill> got that look right hook in
[4:59:27] <Infeirno23> the moment he stepped into the sanctuary he lost
[4:59:34] <BlacSoul> THE VIRUS WILL FIND HIM
[4:59:36] <Infeirno23> there was no other way it seems
[4:59:39] <+MrGreenToS> So overall, what you rate this Pat?
[4:59:40] <+Ominnous> yeah good thing you killed Janus so you could punch his face
[4:59:43] <Axle13j> then hit im with the old one two
[4:59:45] <DSD24> I got some good hits in though right?
[4:59:47] <+shaderichter_belmont> I like to imagine that even if you didn't kill him you still broke his implants so bad he's stuck in your meat for the rest of his life
[4:59:48] <darcfowler1995> good job Pat
[4:59:50] <tigerfang86> REVENGEANCE TAKEN
[4:59:53] <misterspotswood> weird game, i thought it was going to be bigger with a few crimes to investigate
[4:59:56] <+originfacts> @AngriestPat have you tried out soma and enjoyed the ending?
[5:00:00] <+ELITIDUS> Rutger Hauer did an amazing performance tho. RIP <3
[5:00:00] <+professormorrigan> Kill your friend Janus for more time on the clock
[5:00:06] <Axle13j> @Ominnous it was a necessary sacrifice
[5:00:06] <hntronium> rip Janus tho
[5:00:06] <%honeyman18> I liked the pig
[5:00:10] <%Mekhet09> I'm surprised he didn't just body jack him back.
[5:00:11] <+conradical> did Janus ever touch someone with the virus?
[5:00:12] <RubberFistFight> I totally fucking knew how you would choose to end this game before you even decided to play it BTW Pat. It's actually kind of scary how close what you said was to what I said.
[5:00:13] <spicy_2na> Kinda like Omikron how you steal Janus’ body
[5:00:13] <%WhereIsWill> now thats a lotta damage!
[5:00:15] <Axle13j> lolol
[5:00:16] <beetbo2> Kill Janus vs Let everyone else die
[5:00:17] <Daxalog> Good pig
[5:00:19] <tigerfang86> AI Son in your body would be REALLY EVIL
[5:00:21] <OvaltineDream> hope gamer pig gets a good ending
[5:00:22] <@commanderclaw> Are ya winnin son?
[5:00:22] <darcfowler1995> I thought it was pretty good
[5:00:23] <tigerfang86> like SUPER EVIL
[5:00:24] <%depressed_skeleton> drink water
[5:00:24] <%Binary_Fireball> @AngriestPat so would you recommend it?
[5:00:26] <Sevenorangeorbs> I wonder if Rutger Hauer did a speech before he died.
[5:00:27] <waifoong98> it's not even a kid anymore, it's just a crazy AI at that point heh
[5:00:28] <+RealThiele> cyber dystopia yaaaaay
[5:00:31] <+OperatorPlease> I prefer to think that Dan had nanophage anyways and the son's plan was always fucked
[5:00:41] <misterspotswood> what did the AI want with the body anyways? just to have a body?
[5:00:41] <+Mr_Pylon> Rutger Hauer ruled
[5:00:42] <%BestTeaMaker> @angriestpat thoughts on trying out observation sometime in the future? its a horror game where you play a spacestation ai
[5:00:43] <dukenux> it's anti Ex_Machina ending
[5:00:43] <Infeirno23> cool story
[5:00:47] <+Ominnous> so we went to go fist fight the body jacker by body jacking. No one gets away with calling me a hypocrite! @Axle13j
[5:00:47] <%WhereIsWill> so whats the moral of the story here pat?
[5:00:49] <Khorneflakes_> dragged out in some bits though
[5:00:49] <%Archphronimos> @Sevenorangeorbs I like to think his last words really were "...like tears in the rain"
[5:00:51] <VeryTricky> Clumbo
[5:00:55] <MrIntake> squadL
[5:00:57] <%dalmek> alright, goodnight y'all. Sleeby
[5:00:59] <waifoong98> Glad to see ya got over the sundowning Pat LUL
[5:01:00] <dukenux> good, but super downer ending
[5:01:00] <Charuzu> jesus I forgot you were playing that game lol
[5:01:02] <darcfowler1995> yay so excited for ff7
[5:01:08] <vinceshamwowslap> Pat I think you would like code veins
[5:01:09] <Axle13j> Damn right!
[5:01:14] <%honeyman18> This doesn't bode well for cyberpunk 2077's endings
[5:01:17] <dukenux> and the stealth sections can fukc off
[5:01:19] <blaggablag> Five stars gives you bonus bandwidth tho
[5:01:23] <vinceshamwowslap> The new ff7 PogChamp
[5:01:31] <+originfacts> @AngriestPat dont forget the lvl 3 long range truck
[5:01:32] <Dementedpenguin> Collector definitely. Does wonders for packages.
[5:01:40] <%Mekhet09> Doing missions for the Chirl artist gets you the best boots in the game.
[5:01:46] <RubberFistFight> @AngriestPat so remember that all the other "subjects" in that audio log went insane, or didn't stop screaming, or just straight-up fell apart immediately? That "iteration" of Adam that you dealt with was the LAST ONE, and it organised the original's death as soon as it could. Chances are it's got the cybor-crazy as well, it just hid it better.
[5:01:50] <Axle13j> lmao
[5:02:00] <%depressed_skeleton> gothem
[5:02:17] <%Maids4lyfe> apatDab
[5:02:41] <+jjhoho> or honestly that's just how Adam is @rubberfistfight , I'd buy that
[5:02:46] <%Binary_Fireball> no dont stop
[5:02:47] <Ner234> That scp is rad
[5:02:50] <%Binary_Fireball> KEEP GOING
[5:02:51] <tigerfang86> Lmao AI adam sucks super hard too that's great
[5:03:04] <+jjhoho> like the logical conclusion of the "I'd kill me if I knew me" line of thought
[5:03:07] <Futurecity10> nocturne is fucking insanely difficult
[5:03:08] <RubberFistFight> @jjhoho original Adam was the one who released the virus against cybor-Adam, as soon as he knew.
[5:03:13] <stoccton> yeyeye
[5:03:14] <%ClaudeMcGarren> YES
[5:03:15] <%aishman> YEAH DO IT

[5:03:27] <%WhereIsWill> sbfpYeyeye sbfpYeyeye sbfpYeyeye
[5:03:27] <Futurecity10> Sounds like a neat idea
[5:03:27] <Basch71> Citra is ez
[5:03:32] <%Mekhet09> Why do you like bad games.
[5:03:32] <RavenHellkite> YES
[5:03:33] <HiCEnthusiast> citra super ez
[5:03:37] <Jeemukun> i'd watch some SMT games yo
[5:03:37] <%Bt_Robot> Play SWGEMU
[5:03:38] <stoccton> I played regular IV on citra and it worked fine
[5:03:38] <%Poseidon2462> nocturne son
[5:03:39] <ShinMaddrox> I would reccommend the Custom Citra emulators. They work better
[5:03:41] <RavenHellkite> citra is ez
[5:03:43] <RubberFistFight> @jjhoho it kinda seems like OG Adam mighta had a chip on his shoulder, but wasn't a megalomaniacal body-jacking asshole. He just wanted a way to beat death, more or less.
[5:03:44] <+jjhoho> yeah I feel like "oh shit, that's ME. I'm gonna *kill* me" is the kind of thing that just happens when you're just that much of a sociopath
[5:03:58] <+jjhoho> yeah maybe your right huh
[5:04:05] <%Bt_Robot> It's better than FFXIV
[5:04:07] <Zaphire_Saucypants> night @AngriestPat
[5:04:11] <%ClaudeMcGarren> night pat
[5:04:12] <Ion_Laser> Night
[5:04:13] <Dementedpenguin> Bye.
[5:04:14] <+jjhoho> I was attributing a lot of AI Adams actions to regular Adam
[5:04:14] <waifoong98> take care
[5:04:15] <tigerfang86> @RubberFistFight he just sounds like a guy who got really really fucked up over the fact that his mom died and his dad is a weird hypocrite
[5:04:16] <%Bt_Robot> G'night
[5:04:16] <%honeyman18> sleeps
[5:04:17] <Axle13j> NIGHT PAT
[5:04:18] <beetbo2> bye bye
