[0:00:43] <gatorafan> I'm kinda worried considering the things he said about Slay the Spire and how he hates getting locked by RNG.

[0:01:26] <gatorafan> Well, worried is not the right word. I don't really have any stake on the game. But I want him to enjoy video gaems moon2E
[0:01:37] <Valask> oh hello
[0:01:37] <%iRashonal> StS is worse on the grounds of being based off cards in addition to random encounters. DD should be a bit less of a hassle

[0:01:59] <Justin_Wood> Yeyeyeyeyeye, time to see if Pat listened to Ssaryn
[0:02:03] <+jakefdaniels> I wish Pat's stream music was posted somewhere
[0:02:04] <pickle_in_a_cup> oh thank god i needed something to watch
[0:02:05] <skullnaught> Pat please Crusader only run
[0:02:08] <%dreamfillah> Let's do Ancestors quotes
[0:02:13] <eco419> Crazy talk will go nuts
[0:02:15] <gatorafan> Dayum Pat tricking my BTTV host blocker Kappa
[0:02:16] <+DrCrowwPhd> Wet Wind sounds... unfortunate
[0:02:18] <%dreamfillah> Gasping! Reeling! Taken over the edge, into madness!
[0:02:19] <%kylejefferies> I tweeted about mods, there better be some mods.
[0:02:25] <+kiiiirsten> Wow I didn't know Pat was streaming today I was scared by the sudden stream music!
[0:02:31] <+kiiiirsten> oh shit i gotta resub
[0:02:31] <blackjackskellington> But the question is... will he add mods now or later?
[0:02:35] <~AngriestPat> START ARGUING OVER RADIANT VS DARKEST NOW
[0:02:39] <%Gruntini> YE YE YE YE YE
[0:02:39] <+NemokillerV> Holy shit, its dankest dungeon time!
[0:02:39] <lich995> Slowly, gently, this is how a life is taken
[0:02:39] <DirtyPopcornJ> OH. did NOT expect this today.
[0:02:39] <%SashaStarshine> RADIANT
[0:02:41] <ninjaguiden> it's 00.11 and I have work... guess I'll catch the vodd
[0:02:41] <$nitronLVIII> Dankest Patacombs
[0:02:42] <+Nanomachiner> DARKEST
[0:02:44] <solmsk> is this his first time streaming this?
[0:02:45] <%mrbleeeh> RADIANT
[0:02:45] <%SashaStarshine> You dont need help to lose Pat!
[0:02:46] <%kylejefferies> PITCH BLACK DUNGEON!
[0:02:47] <+chrissycht> RADIANT
[0:02:47] <%Gruntini> DANKEST
[0:02:49] <@Moobot> Whoa I don't even shout that much! (@bluemorning104) (warning)
[0:02:49] <stiffybiro> PARAGON
[0:02:53] <Justin_Wood> Oh wait, gameplay won't start for an hour, right?
[0:02:54] <skullnaught> I forgot the difference
[0:02:58] <+chrissycht> POOPOO PEEPEE
[0:02:58] <+DrCrowwPhd> Do Radiant, I'm stressed enough as it is today
[0:02:59] <Mr_LupLup> Dankest!
[0:03:02] <gatorafan> @kylejefferies, I've seen that Tweet, most of the mods people suggested feel like something you'd do AFTER clearing the Darkest Dungeon
[0:03:02] <%bluemorning104> THE DARKNESS SORA
[0:03:02] <%kylejefferies> Moonlit Dungeon!
[0:03:03] <eco419> Dank
[0:03:03] <%dreamfillah> I DON'T CARE I JUST SUGGEST AGAINST having Crimson Court on, it adds another level of micromanagement that might irk you! @AngriestPat
[0:03:06] <sugewin> #freeelmo
[0:03:09] <reddeadwine1277> Delicious Dungeon
[0:03:12] <~AngriestPat> Oh Im not using crimson court
[0:03:12] <%nictron90> Radiant makes sense, it'll make things less grindy, makes it easier to recover, and the ONLY number it changes in combat is makes you slightly better at dodging in high light @AngriestPat
[0:03:16] <%valriot> apatDab apatDab apatDab apatDab apatDab
[0:03:18] <%dreamfillah> okay good
[0:03:26] <%Keansor> Can't watch this stream 'cause of schoolwork, how long does it usually take him to upload the vods? 2 or 3 days right?
[0:03:26] <eco419> @angriestpat coward
[0:03:28] <skullnaught> Radiant is ok
[0:03:31] <+Haarute> Radiant is ideal, yes.
[0:03:32] <%urban_hoof> whooo
[0:03:33] <Justin_Wood> @AngriestPat Did you install the mods Ssaryn suggested, out of curiosity?
[0:03:35] <%SashaStarshine> Radiant makes for better stream and makes it more embarassing when you lose
[0:03:41] <~AngriestPat> I didnt even see those mods justin
[0:03:42] <VRNK> overconfidence is a very quick and sudden killer
[0:03:44] <BigBruthaThunda> Thank you for hanging with Woolie yesterday!
[0:03:47] <+BunkoValentine> GET HYPPPEEEEEEEEEEE
[0:03:47] <AmericanaRed> Apex night
[0:03:47] <stiffybiro> pat if paige isn’t going to then can you stream mass effect instead in the future? i need my weird alien sad goos
[0:03:52] <%kylejefferies> @angriestpat Do we have a mod list for installed mods if mods are modifing the start of this modable game?
[0:03:53] <%dreamfillah> bloodsucker packs and farming blood for the curse is annoying when you want to progress with the main dungeons
[0:03:53] <+DrCrowwPhd> Radiant would also be better for getting used to the water again, I think?
[0:03:59] <+anhero17> yeah
[0:03:59] <%NovaKnightmare> apatDab apatDab apatDab
[0:04:00] <%iRashonal> Tbh Crimson Court is manageable but it'd be adamper on the stream and just going in. Worth a go another time when you wanna take more time with the game though
[0:04:03] <Justin_Wood> Shame. Thanks for the reply though. Enjoy the game dude :D
[0:04:15] <lich995> Also Flagellant is OP as all hell
[0:04:16] <+jakefdaniels> Paaaaat, where can I listen to this steam music outside of your stream? OTL
[0:04:28] <~AngriestPat> It's by a guy named Fingers. He's got a soundcloud
[0:04:28] <Saterion> SourPls
[0:04:29] <jeffishype> You should check out the S-purple character pack @AngriestPat
[0:04:31] <~AngriestPat> that song is called bootloop
[0:04:38] <%dreamfillah> Farming for blood and being funneled to go back to the Courtyard on the threat of characters Wasting away, yeah, better for stream to not have the Court yet @iRashonal
[0:04:41] <+jakefdaniels> Thank you!
[0:04:51] <Mr_216> Pat man you play some funky azz music man
[0:04:52] <%kiiiirsten> apatDab apatDab apatDab apatDab apatDab
[0:04:57] <%iRashonal> Either way lookin forward to watchin you run it. remember: Destroy. Them. All.
[0:05:02] <+anhero17> i think everyone on twitter was agreeing that the the color of madness was good, but not CC
[0:05:06] <mattymcfilth> LMAO peepee
[0:05:10] <+DrCrowwPhd> The phrase "I know a guy named Fingers" is very not good sounding
[0:05:16] <%dreamfillah> EXECUTED WITH IMPUNITY.
[0:05:22] <+Javatron69> hey yo I've never played darkest dungeon before and it
[0:05:23] <Ghostars> @AngriestPat You got your sassy vulpix with you tonight? Kappa
[0:05:24] <%iRashonal> @dreamfillah mhm. only reason I'd wanna see him have it on would be for flagellant because that class rocks
[0:05:27] <+Javatron69> its on sale on steam, should I cop?
[0:05:28] <%SashaStarshine> Wasnt S-Purple the art guy on Breeding season?
[0:05:30] <+fallenangelsamurai> is Woolie here?
[0:05:33] <MarylandJutsu> YOOOO HERE WE GO
[0:05:33] <29vigilanthand> Did pat start yet?
[0:05:33] <$GoogleyGareth> I don't like the enemies or mechanics they introduced in cc. Too much difficulty for me
[0:05:34] <%SashaStarshine> Wait these characters aren't porn
[0:05:40] <%Tokanova> yall guys been havin fun this sinday?
[0:05:41] <%CerberusDriver> I just bought Darkest Dungeon today and its super good
[0:05:41] <%dreamfillah> Remember when it was flat out BROKEN @iRashonal on realease
[0:05:42] <Justin_Wood> Color of madness is just endless waves, right? The game kinda guided me towards giving it a shot right after the first dungeon and boy was that a mistake
[0:05:42] <skullnaught> How quickly the tide turns
[0:05:43] <@Moobot> Whoa I don't even shout that much! (@BayowolfTerra) (warning)
[0:05:44] <%Cervantas> is pat still dead?
[0:05:53] <%joylent_blue> MORTALITY CLARIFIED IN A SINGLE STRIKe
[0:05:55] <%kylejefferies> I would suggest mods made by Muscarine there @angriestpat
[0:05:56] <UnderpaidBob> when does this start?
[0:05:57] <%dreamfillah> oh yeah Colour of Madness is for when you've beat the game like three times
[0:05:59] <Ugato> am I behind or is this still on the intro
[0:06:02] <BayowolfTerra> I know moobot, but just this once.
[0:06:04] <Ugato> ^ ok that answers my question
[0:06:07] <%CerberusDriver> Confidence is a slow and insidious killer
[0:06:12] <%sugewin> I have subbed
[0:06:13] <UnderpaidBob> I just started playing this again, it's so good
[0:06:20] <lich995> The biggest issue I had with CC was the massive size of the dungeons. It didn't make anything more interesting, just lead to tedious invitation grinding
[0:06:21] <%QueequegTheater> Maybe I'll get sent into the DD by Pat too
[0:06:27] <%urban_hoof> is there a character pool where we can submit content @angriestpat
[0:06:31] <%sugewin> Now let's see Pat get shrekt.
[0:06:32] <%kylejefferies> Color of Madness can be done on a first run easy, it is much more self contained than Crimson Court
[0:06:35] <+CJett92> We do it?
[0:06:38] <%crimsonharvest> doing it?
[0:06:39] <%iRashonal> @dreamfillah oh god yes. I miss it but it's still dangerous even after balancing.
[0:06:40] <%joylent_blue> we.... do it?
[0:06:40] <%mayorrev> :o

[0:09:37] <TikanZK> and yakuza was never played again
[0:09:40] <eco419> 111
[0:09:40] <%sugewin> 'Chill' and 'Laid Back' don't seem like things you'd associate with Darkest Dungeon.
[0:09:40] <%some_sunflowers> Replace the brain juice with Red Bull.
[0:09:41] <gatorafan> Yeah sure, nothing says chill and comfy like DARKEST DUNGEON moon2E

[0:09:54] <Ugato> you don't have to smoke weed to be high pat
[0:09:55] <%lewdskeletor13> LIAR
[0:09:55] <%crimsonharvest> Pat the weeds come in candies did you know

[0:10:04] <+blastazoid26> @AngriestPat How high are you from zero to Snoop?
[0:10:06] <reddeadwine1277> Paige drugged Pat
[0:10:07] <HanPaul> Pat only injects RedBull juice
[0:10:07] <DirtyPopcornJ> it's growing on him
[0:10:07] <captainthunderwolf> @AngriestPat If you enjoy the game, I strongly recommend the Shieldbreaker DLC. The others are content expacs, but hers just includes one really great character.
[0:10:08] <ShichiNoBushi> Chat. Pat's AFRAID of needles.
[0:10:08] <%RioGascar> @angriestpat thank god this games turn based huh?
[0:10:08] <DandyDanteGameplay> My girlfriend said to me is this a weed once lol
[0:10:09] <%SaltyDongs> he coulda smoked it and not known
[0:10:09] <+LordLicoriceThe3rd> thats right he snorted his marijuana
[0:10:09] <%Sir_Gawain_Lotsson> THe DEVIL DOESN'T SMOKE HIS VEGETABLES
[0:10:10] <Mockisho> So it's going to be so chill that the stream going to freeze over?
[0:10:10] <ValidVenasaur> I thought you didnt like it
[0:10:10] <%ElenaManetta> Play that one dumb 4 co-op horror game that I keep seeing spammed in commercials.
[0:10:10] <zedravan> Liquid weed in a redbull can
[0:10:12] <BayowolfTerra> lowfi hip-hop chill streams to relax/study to.
[0:10:14] <%lewdskeletor13> Pats drug of choice is LOT BOXEA

[0:10:17] <+cvp5127> sellout
[0:10:18] <%urban_hoof> how much weed did you snort @angriestpat ... you can wash it down with butter beer
[0:10:20] <+Fella54> just got back from a Disney vacation and Canada is the best place to eat.
[0:10:20] <SulfurousAcid> @AngriestPat fresh start or not?
[0:10:20] <stiffybiro> just watching the hollow knight streams, HOW ARE THEY ONLY 250ML CANS HOW SMALL ARE YOUR BABY HANDS
[0:10:22] <+CJett92> Tsundere Pat
[0:10:22] <%TenderBabyBacon> I see pat as more of a cocaine injected straight through the urethra
[0:10:24] <Ugato> Left4Dead????
[0:10:26] <%Corporate_Redeemer> You tolerate it?
[0:10:27] <+dammititsnate> Hey, the stream yesterday with woolie was legit. You guys need to do more of that.
[0:10:28] <gatorafan> Pat is more of a Fortnite player moon2E
[0:10:29] <UnderpaidBob> I think it needs improvements and more content
[0:10:29] <%D_day> apatLiz
[0:10:29] <+Javaa01> It's good, but knowing it could be better is always there, gnawing at you
[0:10:30] <DirtyPopcornJ> Be honest, your ONLY dislike is SQUADS
[0:10:31] <alwayspronking> Tsun Tsuning allover
[0:10:32] <HanPaul> do you begrudge Respawn for making it?
[0:10:32] <AMajorTom> That's what the cool kids are streaming.
[0:10:32] <+minotaurhead> Weed is nothing compared to 75 percent off plat, RIGHT PAT
[0:10:37] <+SaurianCrash> Pat you have more hair on your face than your head!
[0:10:39] <%Corporate_Redeemer> You ACCEPT it?
[0:10:39] <Valask> cost opportunity?
[0:10:40] <Coystick> It
[0:10:47] <%RioGascar> Ninjas streaming it now
[0:10:48] <%thegrimreaper76> How do I link my twitch and discord to get in the subdiscord
[0:10:48] <zedravan> knew it
[0:10:49] <DirtyPopcornJ> see.
[0:10:49] <Coystick> It's called being a Tsundere
[0:10:50] <+CJett92> Other people. Ugh.
[0:10:50] <knifeymcstab> its a good game, but id rather have Titanfall 3
[0:10:52] <reddeadwine1277> Rush should be playing in the background right now
[0:10:53] <SubjectX07x> Yeah I had that feeling at the start too, you kiiinda need a group to play with.
[0:10:54] <%GohanEgret> if only you had friends
[0:10:54] <%valriot> nah
[0:10:56] <$The_CLaUD> cheer250 don’t spoop your pants patrica. Remember, always shove torches onto books, and also, get the DLC for the really really cool extra classes.
[0:10:57] <+mr_dangus> Invite friends?
[0:10:58] <$TheNeedlesD> play with friendos
[0:10:58] <%dreamfillah> A lot of Pat meme faces on screen, hurry hurry clip them for photoshop!
[0:11:00] <$Chimeraelite> LUL
[0:11:00] <%riantDeliration> and then your teammates decide to chase after every single firefight and dies
[0:11:03] <%ElenaManetta> Teamwork's for suckers. I don't need to outrun the enemy, I just need to outrun YOU, PAIGE!!
[0:11:04] <eco419> Oof
[0:11:05] <+CJett92> Good timing on that windows notification
[0:11:05] <%simulationbard> That just means you can blame other people when you lose
[0:11:05] <+HoloToast> perfect sound timing LUL
[0:11:06] <Justin_Wood> @AngriestPat Did you finish Ace Combat 7, by the way?
[0:11:07] <zamzoph> if you lose, you can blame your team
[0:11:07] <%lewdskeletor13> Pat doesn’t have friends LUL
[0:11:09] <+Venhammer> Apex legends feels very boring to me
[0:11:09] <FackinCrazy> The ping system
[0:11:09] <%DomunDomunDomun> The parts that are the best are straight from Titanfall 2. Everything unique to apex is worse.
[0:11:10] <DirtyPopcornJ> actual help? in an online game? LIES
[0:11:10] <%dreamfillah> OH RIGHT
[0:11:13] <SubjectX07x> I'd recommend LFG Discords @angriestpat
[0:11:15] <+blastazoid26> Just play with friends dood
[0:11:16] <%hipowered9mm> whats the discord link?
[0:11:16] <%LogothX> The game is balanced for TEAM
[0:11:18] <Coystick> Just reinstall Tiddyfall 2
[0:11:18] <%Corporate_Redeemer> SOLO MODE WHEN?
[0:11:21] <UnderpaidBob> I get crucified every time I play pathfinder
[0:11:21] <%RioGascar> ah right, randos
[0:11:21] <ForgetfulUthanasiast> I won once with a team. It was all me, I tells ya!
[0:11:23] <%QueequegTheater> YEYEYE
[0:11:26] <%dreamfillah> SHIELDBREAKER, be sure to get the Shieldbreaker DLC @AngriestPat
[0:11:26] <$thebonebard> i usually am the first one to talk to my team and usually say somthing really positive and it usually keeps them nice
[0:11:34] <faeron93> but you play monster hunter
[0:11:38] <%ElenaManetta> Pay them
[0:11:39] <%crimsonharvest> a context-sensitive 'cooperation' button is great yeah
[0:11:39] <%DrCrowwPhd> I'm very fond of how it handles attatchments and stuff
[0:11:40] <%valriot> Its like XIV, its fine until some absolute SHITTERS turn up
[0:11:40] <%AbnormalVoid> I wonder why Kappa
[0:11:41] <%TombstoneTTromboners> pat has no friends
[0:11:42] <$GoogleyGareth> Hey its me your friend
[0:11:43] <DirtyPopcornJ> bribe them?
[0:11:43] <+HoloToast> play with Max VoHiYo
[0:11:43] <prime_name> But Woolie is your friend!
[0:11:43] <ValidVenasaur> woolke does
[0:11:46] <@shinsaryn> It's actually really good.
[0:11:46] <HanPaul> not even Fuggins
[0:11:46] <%gespenst25> Ping system is best because it's close to the zapping system

[0:34:35] <reinbachthe3rd> Ghost Survivors is going to be legit.

[0:35:05] <RossMirage> @AngriestPat did you know South America pays only a third for FFXIV's base game and expansions on Steam? Still pay full price for the sub tho. Sadly this isn't enough to award a SA Data Center. If SE cares little about America, they care even less for South America.

[0:42:20] <+brave_sj> RNG giveth, and RNG taketh away
[0:42:20] <ScreamingMeat> @AngriestPat There are a lot of cool skin mods for this game. Some just turn sprites into Dark Souls characters

[0:42:32] <%apostateCourier> if your crusader dies here it's no big loss
[0:42:32] <lizard0tm> @AngriestPat Once you're comfortable with the game you should try out Marvin Seo's mods, they're FANTASTIC, some of the best mods for DD he's made
[0:42:34] <%konekoryugamine> "I'm the Highwayman. I make ends meat, just like any other man."

[0:42:46] <%ElenaManetta> He's played it like THREE TIMES!
[0:42:46] <+blackkanye> Highwayman is a middle man. He can be up front if you want to point blank a lot
[0:42:49] <%joylent_blue> basically never examine anything except like 3 specific objects
[0:42:49] <%ElenaManetta> HA HA
[0:42:49] <RossMirage> Highwayman is a Position 2-3 character.

[0:43:44] <%joylent_blue> yeah crit that dead body
[0:43:45] <captainthunderwolf> It's genuinely quite simply to lose both Reynauld and Dismas, not during this mission, but the first mission on Stygian when they're Stressed and still have basic skills.
[0:43:50] <%ElenaManetta> Does any other game have a battle system like this? I can't think of many where the corpse plays a problem.
[0:43:51] <%joylent_blue> LORDSPOOKLEKINS radiant

[0:44:11] <%Spydurman> @AngriestPat My thoughts on this game, great for the first 20 hours. With mods great for 20 more after that. Then a big boring slog

[0:44:27] <%Ya_boi_wally > RNGsus has abandoned us
[0:44:27] <captainthunderwolf> @AngriestPat Ironically, most skill level-ups are about increasing accuracy to mimimize RNG, so it gets more predictable as the game continues.

[0:47:22] <+SaurianCrash> Dismus = Dumbass
[0:47:22] <Finaldragoon> Waifu Doctor Kreygasm
[0:47:28] <nutimik> You always get a vestal and PD the first time
[0:47:31] <GMN1> PLAGUE OF GRIPES
[0:47:32] <ShichiNoBushi> You look okay. GET IN!
[0:47:32] <RossMirage> Activate subtitles I'd say.
[0:47:32] <%Ya_boi_wally > moira
[0:47:33] <krabsan> YES
[0:47:34] <%laserbeaming> Barracks and Network are top priority
[0:47:36] <@shinsaryn> Roster won't matter much, keep it there till you actually get people.
[0:47:37] <%simulationbard> The first recuts are always a Vestel and PD
[0:47:37] <%joylent_blue> VoHiYo
[0:47:38] <%ElenaManetta> First one
[0:47:39] <@shinsaryn> and 3 is good for now.
[0:47:39] <%ElenaManetta> Top one
[0:47:40] <%frontlinecaster> Number of recruits
[0:47:40] <%anhero17> top one
[0:47:41] <%Trinity5> YOOSE IT
[0:47:41] <DesuDesuDokiDoki> this one
[0:47:42] <nutimik> Plague Doctor is waifu

[0:47:42] <%afronooch> Sacha Boren Cohen or watever
[0:47:44] <%Tearonex> first one
[0:47:44] <%Rngiddion> top
[0:47:45] <captainthunderwolf> Stagecoach Network and Hero Barracks are probably the most important t upgrade immediately.
[0:47:45] <krabsan> 1st onee
[0:47:46] <%dmdyne99> PLAGUE OF GRIPES
[0:47:46] <sosuke5> Top one

[0:47:47] <%nictron90> Top one
[0:47:49] <%Sphincter_Spelunker> Courtney and Shannon also used to be guys names. Now they're both
[0:47:50] <%frontlinecaster> Top one
[0:47:50] <Finaldragoon> @AngriestPat at least 4 per week in case of a total party wipe
[0:47:50] <dagrum> stagecoach
[0:47:52] <+Comrade_Vladof> Upgrade the first one so you can have a full team every week
[0:47:54] <+Valison> First one is more important at the start
[0:47:56] <$The_CLaUD> Network
[0:47:58] <%SashaStarshine> Sacha is a guys name, Sasha is a gals name
[0:47:59] <%SashaStarshine> if im not wrong
[0:48:00] <%Rngiddion> If everyone dies you can recruit a full party
[0:48:00] <%JGardner88> Always good to have a fresh squad ready just incase
[0:48:00] <Valdorick> You have Str DPS, you have Agi DPS, you have a caster, and you have a healer. You're a real MMO party now.
[0:48:02] <thelonechris> Yet
[0:48:02] <%SirG005E> @AngriestPat Miron = Plague
[0:48:02] <%DomunDomunDomun> network to 4 at minimum

[0:48:31] <lloyddboy> Pat the Bottom CONFIRMED
[0:48:32] <@shinsaryn> @AngriestPat Would actually recommend Top subtitles, bottom subtitles can sometimes block the view for a little bit.
[0:48:33] <%Quigsies> Put that on my tombstone
[0:48:34] <%Sphincter_Spelunker> Moobot hates caps
[0:48:36] <%GarbageNirvana> Story: Dude fucked up
[0:48:38] <captainthunderwolf> @Valdorick And the Caster is AoE DoT! Everyone does big kill.
[0:48:39] <%joylent_blue> dagorad the bot doesn't like too many caps
[0:48:40] <supersunbro1> this game is grim af
[0:48:41] <%Sphincter_Spelunker> excessive caps
[0:48:44] <%ElenaManetta> nah MISSION TIME
[0:48:49] <%dreamfillah> Yeah the bottom subtitles sometimes block out the UI
[0:48:50] <nutimik> Time to delve the dungeon
[0:48:50] <captainthunderwolf> Gotta do quest first.
[0:48:51] <krabsan> yeyeyeyeye

[0:51:26] <MyNameIsRasus> The furry grenade, truly the most dangerous weapon
[0:51:28] <captainthunderwolf> Fun fact, Plague Doctor is a chubby redheaded sociopath.
[0:51:30] <%Nekros4442> We need the ShindoL mod Pat

[0:51:32] <krabsan> THE USUAL SUSPECTS
[0:51:33] <%joylent_blue> i would generally recommend m+kb for this game though, controller is so cumbersome
[0:51:35] <%ElenaManetta> YEAAAH
[0:51:40] <+blackkanye> I remember seeing someone playing with a controller. Even though I'm a big controller user I just decided to m+k it since it is a lot simpler
[0:51:40] <dagorad> playing with a controller DansGame
[0:51:41] <sosuke5> bring shovel and key
[0:51:45] <MyNameIsRasus> THAT'S A GOOD LINE

[0:51:49] <NumbusPlays> Some guys bring free supplies with them
[0:51:49] <%nictron90> You'll probably want at least one shovel
[0:51:50] <$cureneckbeard> perfect
[0:51:51] <%3xgilly> @AmericanaRed boi no
[0:51:52] <%ElenaManetta> and at least 1 shovel, if not 2

[0:54:45] <Twoiis> Take a little bit of everything depending on where you go.

[0:54:46] <+aversal_ammar> Keep it above 75
[0:54:46] <MoulesFritz> maybe
[0:54:46] <+linSP> 0 light OR GIT GUD
[0:54:47] <%joylent_blue> no lower than 75%
[0:54:47] <%dreamfillah> Absolutely not, you will run out of torches
[0:54:47] <%deepseal44> Max light unless you are grinding, Pat. If you are grinding, then you want lower light for loot and XP.
[0:54:47] <lloyddboy> FULL DARK COWARD
[0:54:48] <%TheFilth> Not with crusader
[0:54:48] <$The_CLaUD> STAY ABOVE 75
[0:54:48] <+GrimSquirrel> lower light higher loot
[0:54:48] <%MakotoPB> it affects your loot and sanity
[0:54:48] <buffmurffy> 50-75
[0:54:48] <UselessTheDog> 75 or above
[0:54:48] <%NightBane44> depends on what your aiming to do
[0:54:48] <PowerfulBlackGangs> Above 75
[0:54:48] <trilzy> either battle for the surprise
[0:54:48] <+ChestMimik> "How lucky" Overconfidence is a slow and insidious killer. But knives are pretty quick.
[0:54:48] <%texaporte> do it
[0:54:48] <+HelloImTom08> 75
[0:54:48] <%gusdabus91> LIGHT AFFECTS LOOT RNG
[0:54:49] <+aversal_ammar> YES
[0:54:49] <herfaintsmile> NO MAX LIGHT
[0:54:49] <lionmanguy> secret rooms worth it 100% of the time
[0:54:49] <MyNameIsRasus> Above 75
[0:54:49] <+Juriasu> just sell your torches
[0:54:50] <Zebroneath> Max until you're near the end
[0:54:50] <lizard0tm> Just don't go below 60

[0:54:51] <23rald> depend
[0:54:51] <lich995> Keep at Radiant
[0:54:51] <+gutlesscoward> YEET
[0:54:51] <sosuke5> 75+
[0:54:51] <+EySoyCoco> @AngriestPat max light or no light, in between is useless
[0:54:51] <canadadan1991> Higher than 75
[0:54:51] <trilzy> or room for the scout
[0:54:51] <Fabric_tester> 75
[0:54:51] <%galaxyswirl> MAYBE BUT ONLY WHEN readt
[0:54:52] <+ccwettr123> less light= more rewards but more danger
[0:54:52] <%laserbeaming> Always Max light in hard dungeons
[0:54:52] <MoulesFritz> yes no maybe
[0:54:52] <+Emperor_Bad> no light allowed
[0:54:52] <Samuel412> Maintain high-ish light for now
[0:54:53] <sunny_side_up> be above 75 if thats your plan
[0:54:53] <%OctoBazooka> 75
[0:54:53] <+aversal_ammar> KEEP HIGH
[0:54:53] <HazedNConfused> no lower than 60
[0:54:54] <+azure22900> around 75 is fine
[0:54:54] <$The_CLaUD> Above 75
[0:54:54] <%Nekros4442> You go on low light if you want to find alot of loot. Maximum to stay safe
[0:54:54] <+guyalex> 75 is your number
[0:54:54] <mastersolrac> 755
[0:54:54] <$Big_King_Coconut> light is for weenies
[0:54:54] <UselessTheDog> 75+
[0:54:55] <axelcezar> you don't want debufss
[0:54:55] <+theman515> Little light means harder but better loot, More light means easier but worse loot
[0:54:55] <%Corporate_Redeemer> ABOVE 75%
[0:54:56] <NumbusPlays> Don't always be at 100 but always be in the highest category of light above 75
[0:54:56] <Pillagius> don't go less than 50 for sure, but other than that - you should be OK
[0:54:56] <zafooru> treasure is made of dark
[0:54:57] <zedravan> you get more rewards the lower it is
[0:54:58] <%deepseal44> >75+
[0:54:58] <JeoDood> >75
[0:54:58] <+bthevboi> make the torch the BIG torch
[0:54:58] <%UltraCasualBoom> Dim the lights and make sweet love
[0:54:58] <+SaurianCrash> Quick! somebody stop him!
[0:54:59] <%dreamfillah> Between 50-75 is fine
[0:54:59] <%MakotoPB> more light is better sanity but worse loot
[0:55:00] <$The_CLaUD> 75+
[0:55:00] <+beldaru> Its in 25% increments
[0:55:00] <DirtyPopcornJ> over 75
[0:55:01] <ArbitraryTA> Maximum darkness
[0:55:04] <%nictron90> For now, staying at max light is good, being at minimum light gives bonus loot so it's sometimes worth snuffing your torch to open the dungeon's final chest @AngriestPat
[0:55:05] <+guyalex> maxed is a waste
[0:55:06] <+JusTTheGuyYouNeed> on late game forget about torches
[0:55:06] <SinisterDragon91> Highlight the torch and read the effects
[0:55:07] <+aversal_ammar> 75 above
[0:55:07] <%joylent_blue> you can't stop kleptos
[0:55:07] <%DomunDomunDomun> use torch before entering rooms for scouting, and before battles for surprise
[0:55:07] <UselessTheDog> Click on dismas
[0:55:07] <deadguyisdead> pitch fucking black
[0:55:08] <+beldaru> Use torch below 75%
[0:55:08] <delerim001> kill him
[0:55:09] <lizard0tm> @AngriestPat Just never go below 60
[0:55:11] <zafooru> snuff that torch
[0:55:11] <nutimik> He only steals when you loot
[0:55:13] <sighman55> L1
[0:55:13] <%MakotoPB> less light is better loot but affects sanity
[0:55:13] <Worldbrand> therapy
[0:55:14] <+JusTTheGuyYouNeed> you cant
[0:55:15] <100PercentCritRate> over 75% light grants you bonus chance to surprise
[0:55:15] <delerim001> don't worry
[0:55:15] <AtlasMcCoy> You cant yet
[0:55:15] <+MechaBaphomet> Use a mouse
[0:55:16] <%Ell1ot> you can't.
[0:55:17] <@Moobot> Whoa I don't even shout that much! (@Tampaoster) (warning)
[0:55:17] <%dreamfillah> You can just select a different hero
[0:55:17] <+beldaru> Never go below 50%
[0:55:18] <%dmdyne99> Use torch when below 75% light
[0:55:19] <McAngrimStein> Time to die
[0:55:19] <%ElenaManetta> You have to back away from the door because it shares the same A prompt
[0:55:21] <$The_CLaUD> You can’t
[0:55:21] <+Cavumentum> @AngriestPat More light = better rng for you, lower light = better loot
[0:55:21] <@shinsaryn> He'll steal when he wants to, it's just random.
[0:55:21] <+guyalex> deal with it, that's it
[0:55:21] <MyNameIsRasus> Use the shovel on him Kappa
[0:55:21] <%lessclams> hes gonna steal stuff no matter what
[0:55:22] <%Doodle_Taco> LUL
[0:55:23] <+linSP> dsp time
[0:55:23] <%gusdabus91> LIGHT AFFECTS LOOT RNG
[0:55:24] <mastersolrac> Klepto will auto loot
[0:55:24] <%Corporate_Redeemer> FIGHT
[0:55:24] <krabsan> ...
[0:55:24] <+2sappy> the lower the light, the better the rewards you find, but also the tougher the enemies
[0:55:27] <Niehile> nah. it depends on purpose of your run. You can send them almost naked Just to loot everything in the dark
[0:55:28] <%jaybombdotcom> @AngriestPat the klepto just steal found loot
[0:55:28] <%joylent_blue> @AngriestPat kleptos will take shit no matter what, you can't stop it
[0:55:28] <%GeneralSCPatton> The Klepto will tandomly claim dibs. You can't stop him.
[0:55:28] <%NightBane44> @AngriestPat Klepto is random proc doesn't matter if they interact with it or not
[0:55:28] <%AbnormalVoid> 🎺
[0:55:29] <UselessTheDog> Seriously why are you using a controller for this game its so much worse
[0:55:31] <%TheFilth> You’ll be fine
[0:55:31] <%laserbeaming> Controller sucks for this game
[0:55:31] <%Mekhet09> kelpto means he'll take shit anyway.
[0:55:31] <%urban_hoof> never below 50%
[0:55:31] <$Dotta5> @AngriestPat Have Paige play, 100% blindness
[0:55:32] <captainthunderwolf> @AngriestPat Lower light is more crits for you AND enemies, and better loot. It's better to either be VERY HIGH light (+75) or VERY LOW light (25 or less) to get the respective bonuses. Middle ground is a waste to maintain.

[0:56:04] <UnderpaidBob> skeletons can't bleed
[0:56:05] <+Haarute> Blight is really good against skeletons. Check enemy's resistances always.
[0:56:05] <UselessTheDog> It's awkward how he's fighting two Matts right now
[0:56:05] <%apostateCourier> skeletons don't bleed pat
[0:56:06] <lizard0tm> Skellys are very strong against bleed
[0:56:06] <buffmurffy> see what they're weak to first
[0:56:06] <flattopswag> No bleed the skeleton

[0:56:13] <MSN04_Sazabi> Pat is lost to us people, he can no longer use the mouse for anything other than OBS. I bet he even browses the net with the gamepad.
[0:56:13] <$The_CLaUD> @angriestpat BUFFS ARE SUPER GOOD, DON’T IGNORE THE BUFFS!!!!!!
[0:56:14] <MyNameIsRasus> Use Mahamaon

[0:56:24] <DirtyPopcornJ> it's a SKELETON
[0:56:24] <AmericanaRed> OP
[0:56:26] <%ElenaManetta> Skelmo is filled with blood
[0:56:32] <%GeneralSCPatton> Make their marrow leak all over the place.
[0:56:32] <%Ell1ot> i killed off my knight guy in the practice level. I got a new guy when i got to town
[0:56:33] <+sirbloodcake> noxious blast is like one of 3 best moves in the game mate <3
[0:56:35] <%nictron90> @ChestMimik to be fair you can totally poison the skeletons. ...somehow
[0:56:37] <krabsan> USE DAZZLING LIGHT
[0:56:38] <+Cavumentum> Inject it right into their bones
[0:56:38] <+beldaru> Always go for the kill
[0:56:38] <%MakotoPB> blight undead because they don't have blood left
[0:56:38] <%ChoculaUltra> clearly these guys are immune to marrow poisoning.
[0:56:39] <TheBlankAce> Who would think that acid is useful on living things
[0:56:41] <mastersolrac> Blight Town PD we do it
[0:56:41] <MyNameIsRasus> Use Thundaga
[0:56:42] <%joylent_blue> @AngriestPat enemy resistances are VERY important
[0:56:43] <lizard0tm> Love the skellys, they just want fren
[0:56:44] <sighman55> judge them
[0:56:45] <%Aitch971> pls no bully paiges friends
[0:56:46] <+beldaru> Secure the kill
[0:56:46] <%apostateCourier> Blight works super great on skeletons
[0:56:47] <+ChestMimik> @nictron90 ...WHAT
[0:56:53] <+mr_dangus> Look at resistances PAT
[0:56:54] <@shinsaryn> Ye, Crusader is always good in Ruins.
[0:56:55] <captainthunderwolf> @ChestMimik Ironically, the game is super unclear as to how Blight is both poison AND disease, so Blight FUCKS UP skeletons.

[1:05:28] <%SirG005E> things as simple as click on it are now instanely hard bc of controlelr
[1:05:28] <%Mr_Strut> This is why you use a mouse and keyboard
[1:05:28] <zafooru> mice are for cowards

[1:05:36] <%bestwaifuritsu> @AngriestPat Always click on traps with Dimas, he's got crazy high disarm chance at the start
[1:05:36] <+linSP> monch it all
[1:05:36] <%laserbeaming> @AngriestPat you click on it, but who knows how you do it with a controller?
[1:05:39] <%dreamfillah> Holy shit, TEN FOOD

[1:05:46] <+aivalera> Go to your stats and see which one has the highest percent in trap
[1:05:47] <pectusumbra> is this actually the first mission?
[1:05:47] <captainthunderwolf> @AngriestPat Highwaymen, Jesters, Houndmasters and Grave Robbers have the best Trap disarm chance, usually 90%+. You click the trap while having the character you want to use active to roll a disarm attempt.
[1:05:48] <ShaggE64> Shove that in your gob
[1:05:49] <%joylent_blue> i dont know how the controller menus work PunOko
[1:05:55] <+linSP> MORE
[1:05:56] <%ElenaManetta> I love that Ritz cracker chomp
[1:05:56] <alwayspronking> This game is better with Mouse and Keyboard.
[1:05:58] <NumbusPlays> yeah
[1:05:58] <%dreamfillah> Great playing with a controller huh
[1:05:59] <sunny_side_up> they dont work @joylent_blue
[1:06:00] <Twoiis> 10 food? What difficulty is this on?
[1:06:02] <Kathariya> is game doesn't work with controller FFS PAT!
[1:06:03] <NumbusPlays> that's why you bring a healer
[1:06:04] <chancho4tierra> PAT every hero has his strong points, dissarm with the gunner
[1:06:05] <Valdorick> You must become FAT on success.
[1:06:06] <%joylent_blue> sunny_side_up thats fair
[1:06:11] <DirtyPopcornJ> Tina, eat the food!
[1:06:13] <$Big_King_Coconut> eats and then immediately needs more food

[1:06:19] <%Quigsies> TORCH
[1:06:23] <@shinsaryn> That always has 10 food, its just a matter of if Reynauld wants to be a FUCK.
[1:06:24] <SpookyBeef7> Didn't Pat mention one time that he can't do mouse+keyboard because his wrists are fucked?
[1:06:28] <+JusTTheGuyYouNeed> this game is aggressively a M/K game
[1:06:28] <%dreamfillah> Each Hero has a different trap disarming percentage, always check when faced with traps @AngriestPat
[1:06:30] <%konekoryugamine> There;s a Crunchyroll livestream going on right now
[1:06:31] <%FrostMass22> Pat needs more brain juice
[1:06:31] <%brackboi> Just finally got my first two prime warframes ever mesa and chroma i even grinded them out!
[1:06:31] <captainthunderwolf> Eating Food is usually about managing Death's Door characters or healing up before a boss.
[1:06:32] <+linSP> can you mash A as you go to find the hidden rooms
[1:06:34] <%konekoryugamine> Golden Kamuy is on
[1:06:38] <+GenesisKnight> Why is he playing with a controller? NotLikeThis
[1:06:41] <%ElenaManetta> NAILED IT
[1:06:41] <%konekoryugamine> NO idea
[1:06:42] <%deepseal44> Golden Kamuy's manga is great, but
[1:06:43] <Niehile> @angriestpat food is heal %. disarm is % depends on char and lvl of heroes. 1 step in hallway = 1 turn (if bleed or blight active)
[1:06:46] <%deepseal44> I heard the anime was eh
[1:06:48] <lizard0tm> See, tha's why you bring shovels
[1:06:48] <+eliytresoc> you want to detorch before looting, because you get more loot in the dark
[1:06:50] <%MakotoPB> Snuff out all the light! get greedy apatSkelmoney apatSkelmoney apatSkelmoney
[1:06:51] <Exicuren> @angriestpat Ypu can do it with a controller, when you are close to the Trap, there will be a spiderweb icon, that means that they close to the tran an can disable it, then just press X and they will try to disarm it
[1:06:51] <%ElenaManetta> HISSsSSS
[1:06:51] <NumbusPlays> that's why chat told you to bring a shovel
[1:06:54] <%konekoryugamine> Oh, I get it, he's playingit like Dark Souls!

[1:11:53] <%nictron90> @angriestpat antiquarian is a gimmick character, her attacks suck but you find special loot and can stack gold/gems higher
[1:11:54] <%ElenaManetta> Also if you care: You can change their appearance the same location you can change their name. Just color changes.
[1:11:54] <sighman55> get anti get rich

[1:18:52] <Pillagius> @AngriestPat it's sold back by default at the end
[1:18:53] <canadadan1991> nothing stays
[1:18:58] <%deepseal44> upgrading stage coach is wise
[1:18:59] <Tsoulus> everything stays
[1:18:59] <%konekoryugamine> Uh, Quesnel was freaking out tehre
[1:19:01] <ScreamingMeat> Just because she LIKES ranged weapons doesn't mean she knows how to use them. I like animation but I don't know how to animate
[1:19:03] <%joylent_blue> CerberusDriver that person sounds like an idiot :)
[1:19:12] <mr_slaide> OF THE DAMNED
[1:19:12] <%deepseal44> somebody give that hellion a gun!
[1:19:14] <al0nem0nster> but wasting food is still less costly than wasting recruits.
[1:19:15] <count_bob> oW THE EDGE.
[1:19:20] <sighman55> never calm
[1:19:21] <%konekoryugamine> "Whattya buyin'?"
[1:19:24] <%CerberusDriver> They just think they're above certain things, which is why DmC is perfect for them I guess
[1:19:25] <axelcezar> EVERYTHING IS BAD!
[1:19:26] <mastersolrac> upgrade the stress relief places
[1:19:26] <pectusumbra> one more fight
[1:19:31] <+Cavumentum> Now get your ASS IN THE DUNGEON
[1:19:31] <lizard0tm> Check trinket cart?
[1:19:34] <nutimik> you need to do a few dungeons before the town opens up
[1:19:35] <%ElenaManetta> It saves like every 10 microseconds
[1:19:36] <pectusumbra> or one more mission. and yes, autosaves for days
[1:19:38] <sighman55> still tutorial
[1:19:40] <%simulationbard> Game is always saving
[1:19:43] <Samuel412> @deepseal44 Good idea! The Ancestor's Pistol will further buff her ranged skills!
[1:19:44] <%simulationbard> DLC
[1:19:46] <pectusumbra> yeah, don't do that yet
[1:19:46] <hntronium> YOU'RE NOT MY DAD, SON. is what he would probably say
[1:19:47] <nutimik> Don't go to the farmstead yet
[1:19:49] <%ScrotesMuhGoats> these emotes area real fuckin good
[1:19:50] <%deepseal44> indeed
[1:19:50] <nutimik> trust me
[1:19:50] <@shinsaryn> So. DON'T EVEN TRY RIGHT NOW. @AngriestPat
[1:19:51] <%konekoryugamine> So, shit's FUCKED
[1:19:53] <%joylent_blue> cool!
[1:19:55] <%ElenaManetta> It is practically impossible to shut down cheat in this game
[1:19:55] <%nictron90> don't go there unless you want to get owned
[1:19:57] <mastersolrac> don't even bother
[1:19:58] <lizard0tm> DO NOT go there
[1:19:59] <juxtest> mmm miasma
[1:19:59] <alwayspronking> spoopy fat gas LUL
[1:20:00] <%deepseal44> Hellion Arbalest build please
[1:20:00] <+WontStandIdle> farmstead monkaS
[1:20:00] <bleugh> try it right now
[1:20:00] <+Haarute> Now you can choose where to go based on rewards!
[1:20:01] <+Zaque13> dont
[1:20:01] <%deepseal44> NO
[1:20:01] <%Typhaeon> The Color Out of Space
[1:20:01] <PowerfulBlackGangs> DO NOT
[1:20:01] <%bestwaifuritsu> NO IT DOESNT
[1:20:02] <guyman125> no
[1:20:02] <Fujiwara_92> Get your ass in the dungeon Pat

[1:20:04] <+GenesisKnight> Don't do that yet
[1:20:04] <NumbusPlays> that's the DLC, do not go in there yet
[1:20:05] <%CerberusDriver> youll get fucked
[1:20:05] <axelcezar> DLC shit there
[1:20:06] <lloyddboy> DO NOT
[1:20:06] <luckysteak> not a good idea
[1:20:06] <%konekoryugamine> DON'T DO IT
[1:20:06] <ShichiNoBushi> We do it.
[1:20:07] <mastersolrac> NOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOO
[1:20:07] <ScreamingMeat> The Color Out Of Space
[1:20:07] <definitelynotyakra> Probably not the best bet atm
[1:20:07] <%konekoryugamine> Good boy
[1:20:08] <horsesaredumb> GO COWARD
[1:20:08] <%GeneralSCPatton> NOOOOO
[1:20:09] <Garthunox> NO
[1:20:09] <pectusumbra> It just defaults to that
[1:20:09] <bleugh> DO IT
[1:20:10] <%dreamfillah> It's basically that Lovecraft Story about ALIEN COLOURS warping reality
[1:20:12] <%deepseal44> The game is called Darkest Dungeon
[1:20:12] <Valentinius_Anodyne> Well, that's definitely a good idea :)
[1:20:13] <%joylent_blue> apatBig NO
[1:20:14] <yourliteraldog> nope dont go
[1:20:14] <Tsoulus> gogogogo
[1:20:15] <%deepseal44> So go to the Darkest Dungeon
[1:20:15] <dekkitout> space-time fuckery, you say? im interested...
[1:20:18] <%deepseal44> It's only level 0 Pat
[1:20:19] <%konekoryugamine> Come on, let's not fuck him up here
[1:20:21] <%GeneralSCPatton> Cowardice is safety
[1:20:22] <%ScrotesMuhGoats> you should definitely 100% do it
[1:20:23] <+aversal_ammar> Noooooo
[1:20:23] <+Cavumentum> It's like the FNV DLC, it's letting you know it exists
[1:20:25] <guyman125> look at rewards as well
[1:20:27] <%Jaxnos> time to watch true despair
[1:20:30] <Fujiwara_92> DONT DO IT
[1:20:30] <Samuel412> It might want you to do it, but keep in mind this game doesn't have your best interests at heart
[1:20:32] <sighman55> check trinkets
[1:20:33] <NarcissistCactus> do it pussy :)
[1:20:33] <deviljhojho94> kill
[1:20:35] <@shinsaryn> @AngriestPat So you generally wanna go for missions that give you really good trinkets, but if you can't go for rewards you really want.
[1:20:35] <JINcredible1> check rewards too
[1:20:37] <zafooru> go to darkest dungeon
[1:20:37] <nutimik> Check the rewards
[1:20:49] <%konekoryugamine> It goes by difficulty,
[1:20:52] <@shinsaryn> Yes
[1:20:53] <Garthunox> Do not do the colour of madness stuff till you have a few decent people
[1:20:53] <ScreamingMeat> Explore the Color Out Of SPace you bitch
[1:20:55] <pectusumbra> yes
[1:20:55] <%joylent_blue> accessories
[1:20:56] <canadadan1991> yes
[1:20:56] <%konekoryugamine> SERIOUSLY.
[1:20:56] <juxtest> That bounty hunter really wants to go in
[1:20:56] <%trnzero> yep
[1:20:57] <kingra> Yep
[1:20:57] <%simulationbard> yes
[1:20:58] <%ElenaManetta> It's inside your chest
[1:20:58] <UselessTheDog> Take the grave robber, she's the best
[1:20:59] <yourliteraldog> I wanna see pat fail like alot but win eventually lets help him out
[1:21:01] <Samuel412> Trinkets are buff items
[1:21:02] <%konekoryugamine> -_-
[1:21:03] <+Vyniea> Trinkets are just accessories
[1:21:04] <%ElenaManetta> Yes
[1:21:05] <%konekoryugamine> AUGH
[1:21:06] <%trnzero> equippables
[1:21:06] <%SashaStarshine> A trinket is an equippable item
[1:21:08] <cheezbass> hit the chest
[1:21:08] <Twoiis> basically accessories.
[1:21:08] <luckysteak> trinkets boost your heroes!
[1:21:11] <mr_slaide> That one sucks.
[1:21:12] <canadadan1991> items help adventurers
[1:21:14] <%ElenaManetta> It will say.
[1:21:14] <alwayspronking> Equipable items are all trinkets @AngriestPat
[1:21:14] <%SashaStarshine> Ye
[1:21:15] <yourliteraldog> You can equip them to your bois
[1:21:16] <pectusumbra> open a character's menu and they all get 2 slots
[1:21:16] <+ccwettr123> right click on character portrait, 2 trinket slots on each boi
[1:21:16] <lizard0tm> @AngriestPat DO THE SCOUT! That crusader trinket is super good
[1:21:17] <@shinsaryn> Some are class specific.
[1:21:17] <+Haarute> Some are class specific.
[1:21:18] <%wolfofsound> is this a trinket he says on the trinket screen
[1:21:18] <mr_slaide> Some are class specific.
[1:21:18] <DoubleDurian> yes, but some are class specific
[1:21:19] <canadadan1991> mostly
[1:21:19] <Samuel412> Some are class restricted
[1:21:19] <luckysteak> some are class locked
[1:21:19] <%joylent_blue> yes, some are class based
[1:21:19] <%nictron90> Some are class specific
[1:21:20] <%trnzero> depends
[1:21:20] <nutimik> They're accessories, you can equip them on the character screen
[1:21:21] <alwayspronking> Some are class restricted
[1:21:21] <%AirlineFood74> @AngriestPat some are class-exclusive
[1:21:21] <UselessTheDog> Some are character specific but not most
[1:21:22] <guyman125> some are class specific
[1:21:22] <delerim001> some
[1:21:22] <JINcredible1> all those items are trinkets and some are specific
[1:21:23] <canadadan1991> some are spec
[1:21:24] <yourliteraldog> Some are class locked
[1:21:24] <Gray_skies1993> depends on the trinket
[1:21:25] <lionmanguy> Flagellent?
[1:21:25] <Coystick> Trinkets are Rings
[1:21:26] <kratosdestroys> Depends
[1:21:28] <horsesaredumb> depends on the trinket
[1:21:30] <sighman55> some are class specific
[1:21:30] <lionmanguy> Hey pat say that one again?
[1:21:32] <mastersolrac> some are exclusive
[1:21:33] <%ElenaManetta> You can also sell trinkets if needed.
[1:21:34] <+gravely_mistaken> Yes, but some class specific ones
[1:21:37] <lloyddboy> fluh-GEL-ent
[1:21:38] <Garthunox> trinkets are warframe mods!
[1:21:39] <luckysteak> that is really good
[1:21:39] <%konekoryugamine> Oh my god I'm losing my mind here. I can't tell if it's lack of caffeine or the fact it's this style getting to me.
[1:21:39] <UselessTheDog> Noooo
[1:21:40] <+Vyniea> Crest is pretty good
[1:21:42] <+Valison> Flagellants are obscenely strong
[1:21:42] <%Ell1ot> you give them to your peoples and they get hard
[1:21:43] <kratosdestroys> Some are Class Specific'
[1:21:44] <Samuel412> Each hero can use 2 at once, some combo together to be OP as all fuck
[1:21:44] <%konekoryugamine> Yep, it's the caffeine
[1:21:46] <captainthunderwolf> @AngriestPat What Saryn said, but keep in mind that the really good Trinkets usually come from higher-level Trinkets. The best ones at your level will mostly buff Stun, Damage, or Accuracy. The best overall Trinkets are always class-locked or are unique and can only be one-to-a-save-file.
[1:21:46] <%konekoryugamine> One sec
[1:21:47] <%SashaStarshine> WOOO
[1:21:49] <%SashaStarshine> Me trinket
[1:21:51] <Ids560> you put trinkets on your heroes and give them bonuses
[1:21:54] <sighman55> crest is fine
[1:21:55] <lizard0tm> Yes
[1:21:56] <+Cavumentum> Yeah it's fine
[1:21:56] <guyman125> sure
[1:21:57] <UselessTheDog> TAKE GRAVE ROBBER
[1:21:59] <deviljhojho94> ye
[1:21:59] <lloyddboy> Yes
[1:22:01] <%ElenaManetta> Hellion is good but your team is good too
[1:22:01] <%konekoryugamine> Mix it up a bit maybe
[1:22:01] <%AirlineFood74> yes
[1:22:03] <canadadan1991> ya theyre good
[1:22:03] <lizard0tm> Keep the usual suspect
[1:22:03] <luckysteak> spread the love!
[1:22:03] <chancho4tierra> sure why not
[1:22:04] <pectusumbra> Up to you bonedaddy
[1:22:04] <Garthunox> oh no
[1:22:07] <+Haarute> They're not crazy so it's fine.
[1:22:09] <+ABadIdea> Any Critical Role fans here? How would you assemble Vox Machina or the Mighty Nein in Darkest Dungeon? doodBenny3
[1:22:09] <%trnzero> mix em up
[1:22:10] <+flustered__> Keep in mind those who aren't used don't get XP
[1:22:10] <nutimik> Doesn't matter much
[1:22:11] <captainthunderwolf> This is a good Ruins team.
[1:22:13] <+GimmMeUhSammich> Bring Calmette
[1:22:14] <+Vyniea> On Radiant it's fine to have an A team
[1:22:17] <$The_CLaUD> Up to you
[1:22:17] <%ElenaManetta> You will be cycling through anyway so
[1:22:17] <%simulationbard> Bring some new people but make sure you keep the Vestel
[1:22:19] <UselessTheDog> Swap highwayman for grave robber
[1:22:20] <cheezbass> always run lowest sanity levels
[1:22:20] <+Cavumentum> Dump Highwayman if you bring anyone new
[1:22:21] <Fujiwara_92> They are good
[1:22:21] <%konekoryugamine> @pectusumbra Did you just call him BONEDADDY?! XD
[1:22:22] <Garthunox> pat hates buffs that give rebuffs!
[1:22:22] <guyman125> they are below 40 stress so its fine
[1:22:31] <%konekoryugamine> I fucking LOVE that!
[1:22:31] <mastersolrac> Level them up
[1:22:32] <Garthunox> debuffs*
[1:22:32] <+Rewrench> fine to do same team for bit and discard the ones that go bad or die off
[1:22:33] <buffmurffy> dont use the swordsman so you can use him after you get the trinket
[1:22:36] <mr_slaide> Switch the highwayman for grave robber.
[1:22:37] <luckysteak> shift click!
[1:22:38] <%ElenaManetta> Now Pat is a PRO
[1:22:45] <@shinsaryn> You generally want an entire stack of food and torches in a Short mission.
[1:22:46] <%konekoryugamine> Pat is now BONEDADDY!
[1:22:46] <%Ell1ot> when i played, i tried to replace my Klepto dude because it's very annoying when he steals loot
[1:22:46] <%nictron90> @angriestpat if you shift click you can buy whole stacks at once
[1:22:46] <Pillagius> @AngriestPat you could take new ones. Antiquarian is super good for money stuff (you just have to open all "containers" with her)
[1:22:48] <%nictron90> I think?
[1:22:49] <%konekoryugamine> XD
[1:22:50] <%bestwaifuritsu> you dont need to buy tons of torches and food for short dungeons
[1:22:50] <chancho4tierra> 1 key 1 shovel
[1:22:52] <HazedNConfused> perfect
[1:22:52] <+Cavumentum> Now EVERYBODY dies
[1:22:52] <mastersolrac> Use them
[1:22:54] <sighman55> time for herbs
[1:22:55] <%simulationbard> Shift click to buy a whole stack
[1:22:55] <%Mr_Strut> Medicine also
[1:22:56] <mr_slaide> bring another holy water
[1:22:56] <zedravan> 1 bandage?
[1:22:56] <nutimik> 1 key would be fine
[1:22:57] <mrsandyclaws> bandages
[1:22:58] <lizard0tm> Shift click buys a stack
[1:23:00] <lloyddboy> HERB
[1:23:03] <UselessTheDog> Just 1 key is good
[1:23:03] <%DomunDomunDomun> shift click for a whole stack
[1:23:06] <@shinsaryn> Might wanna bring bandages as well. Just 1 or 2.
[1:23:07] <nutimik> nothing else, you can find items in the dungeon
[1:23:07] <sighman55> herbs are bae
[1:23:08] <Fujiwara_92> Bandages
[1:23:09] <+Haarute> One bandage would be smart.
[1:23:10] <mastersolrac> 8 food
[1:23:12] <juxtest> 160 keys
[1:23:14] <%deepseal44> Hi Pat
[1:23:14] <%konekoryugamine> Yeah, heal items
[1:23:16] <bluefooddye> No torches means big money
[1:23:17] <%ElenaManetta> Pat will figure it out!
[1:23:19] <yourliteraldog> Eventually you wanna cycle them out and send the jobbers on milk runs while your heavy hitters rest up and drink them sleeves back to sanity
[1:23:21] <%konekoryugamine> Like you're playing a dungeon crawler in Persona
[1:23:22] <UselessTheDog> Click on the key you already have to sell it back
[1:23:27] <Garthunox> an extra holy water will help
[1:23:29] <UselessTheDog> If you just want 1
[1:23:30] <lizard0tm> 2 herbs
[1:23:30] <%nictron90> You probably don't need herbs where you're going
[1:23:34] <%konekoryugamine> Always have a buff and a healing item x 3
[1:23:36] <%bestwaifuritsu> keep in mind that all the items you buy means less room for items found in dungeons unless you throw something away when youre in there
[1:23:36] <@shinsaryn> Oh boi
[1:23:37] <Garthunox> herbs aren't that useful in the ruins
[1:23:37] <%ElenaManetta> BYEEEE
[1:23:38] <%SashaStarshine> Woah
[1:23:38] <%simulationbard> Herbs are for cleaning shit
[1:23:39] <%deepseal44> UH OH
[1:23:39] <+flustered__> monkaS
[1:23:40] <Valdorick> Chat would have you bring at least 1 of everything, but argue over how many more than 1.
[1:23:41] <lizard0tm> Uh oh
[1:23:41] <%Typhaeon> Oh man
[1:23:41] <%konekoryugamine> Uh, what
[1:23:41] <Coystick> Oh no

[1:33:27] <%simulationbard> Back across the river styx, boatman be damned
[1:33:27] <gatorafan> Elmo rubbed Pat's back and now he learned HM01 Cut moon2E
[1:33:28] <%Soffeli> It's fine, next time mute the mic
[1:33:28] <%Corporate_Redeemer> Is it the REAL PAT, tho?
[1:33:29] <%ElenaManetta> I SAID only NICE THINGS
[1:33:30] <%Ell1ot> was Pat puking from his face or his butt?
[1:33:33] <DirtyPopcornJ> Did you re-inject Redbull into your veins?
[1:33:33] <reddeadwine1277> it sounded like doves crying...
[1:33:37] <weontheultralightbeam> we see shit stains on his hands monkaS
[1:33:38] <%Prism_Wing> He died like no one in Kingdom Hearts did.
[1:33:38] <%Sphincter_Spelunker> @ElenaManetta You joke. But that was ACTUALLY the case during one of Paige's FF4 streams
[1:33:39] <%LiquidBinge> Did Pat do a boom boom
[1:33:41] <%joylent_blue> yeah i bet LUL
[1:33:41] <+Valison> Pretty sure we all heard you pooping
[1:33:42] <Laicuss> Pat finally succumbed to the g-Virus and is starting to mutate at an accelerated rate
[1:33:43] <+Haarute> Get a bandage and we're good.
[1:33:44] <alwayspronking> Is Pat okay?
[1:33:46] <%Mr_Strut> Medicine
[1:33:47] <OwlLightningMage> Pat died and has been reborn
[1:33:47] <+Ace9817> Yeah violent pooping really wakes a man up
[1:33:47] <captainthunderwolf> Ohh, Pat went and did some coke.
[1:33:48] <dekkitout> big shits do that to ya
[1:33:49] <$cureneckbeard> pooping because of red bull
[1:33:49] <CuttleCrow> diaper change : COMPLETE
[1:33:49] <Kathariya> is this pat from the future?
[1:33:49] <buffmurffy> pat pooped the first time this month
[1:33:50] <DirtyPopcornJ> Pat.
[1:33:50] <sighman55> go time
[1:33:50] <zedravan> bandages?
[1:33:51] <dagorad> dying before cyberpunk release FailFish
[1:33:51] <%Corporate_Redeemer> Is this Pat A SKRULL??
[1:33:52] <%nademonkey1100> that must have been good shit then
[1:33:53] <Gr4ndm4rsh4ll> That’s the heroin taking effect, Pat
[1:33:53] <%BlainPLD> Puking your brains out CONFIRMED to wake your ass up!!
[1:33:53] <%Mr_Strut> MOAR KEYS

[1:33:55] <%SinisterWang> apatBig poopin
[1:33:55] <%wolfofsound> this is actually elmo puppeteering pat's corpse
[1:33:58] <%lewdskeletor13> The shit was holding him back PogChamp

[1:34:04] <+DukeMoose> Pat didnt, poop, he funneled a fast buttchugging of red bull to recover his fluids
[1:34:09] <+Dnarnya17> 2 keys!!
[1:34:09] <%joylent_blue> eh
[1:34:10] <%Ell1ot> Pat has expelled the darkest form his dungeon
[1:34:12] <+ElarusTheMage> Skellmo stole Pats skin, and is playing right now,
[1:34:12] <%Zombino924> One step closer to Pat shitting himself on Stream
[1:34:13] <nutimik> don't buy anything else
[1:34:13] <%trnzero> worth
[1:34:15] <@shinsaryn> The deal is to make more money than you spend.
[1:34:16] <%nictron90> you don't need herbs in this area I think
[1:34:17] <%QueequegTheater> @AngriestPat They are, only use them for boss runs
[1:34:18] <DirtyPopcornJ> "The stress from pooping for ten minutes straight woke me up!"
[1:34:18] <PowerfulBlackGangs> Don't need AV in Ruins
[1:34:19] <Valdorick> You get back some of the cost if its not used.
[1:34:21] <Endocrom> Gotta spend money to make money
[1:34:22] <%simulationbard> you genrall don't need antivenom for ruins
[1:34:22] <%ElenaManetta> I almost never carry them because they take up inventory slots and I just have my healer fix me up during fights.
[1:34:24] <%joylent_blue> you're probably good with what you got
[1:34:25] <%Corporate_Redeemer> You are fine
[1:34:26] <%Prism_Wing> @corporate_redeemer Close. He's a clone like Mary Jane Kappa
[1:34:29] <juxtest> Buy the laundanum and get fucked uuuupppp
[1:34:29] <+Ace9817> @wolfofsound like that Rick and Morty episode where the cats control that lady's body?
[1:34:29] <nutimik> You find items in the dungeon anyway
[1:34:31] <pectusumbra> certain items can be used on certain curios as well. for now it's fine to be lighter as you get a feel
[1:34:32] <%BlainPLD> I cant even see Elmo's lips move! Good boy!!
[1:34:32] <chancho4tierra> Thats cool
[1:34:33] <swagshark21> @AngriestPat yo is this a new estate bro
[1:34:36] <%TheFilth> Anti venom and bandages are good for areas with a lot of blight or bleed enemies
[1:34:38] <+Dnarnya17> You make it back home from you use them right
[1:34:38] <%wolfofsound> @Ace9817 exactly like it
[1:34:39] <NumbusPlays> holy water and keys are the most important curio items for ruins
[1:34:40] <buffmurffy> its an easy, short quest anyway
[1:34:42] <captainthunderwolf> Basically, Herbs heal Blight and work with certain Curios. Not really needed for the Ruins where few if any enemies Blight.
[1:34:44] <@shinsaryn> The NEW FREE REAL ESTATE.
[1:34:45] <pectusumbra> don't be afraid to cheat on curios and just use the wiki
[1:34:50] <%joylent_blue> LUL still gets me
[1:34:55] <lizard0tm> It's The Free Real Estate
[1:34:56] <swagshark21> dope
[1:34:57] <+Dnarnya17> Cheat on Curios!!!
[1:34:57] <%QueequegTheater> filthy gotdamn furreners
[1:34:57] <Worldbrand> god it's so good
[1:34:58] <%blacksoap65> apatDab apatDab
[1:34:58] <Valdorick> @Prism_Wing He died, and Elmo made a deal with Satan to kill the Super Best Friends Play channel Kappa
[1:35:00] <%Corporate_Redeemer> @prism_wing Oh no, the CLONE SAGA starts again!
[1:35:01] <%ScrotesMuhGoats> as it stands, half of my paycheck every 2 weeks is going to twitch subs
[1:35:03] <TheWonderfulGako> Do you ever drink water, pat?!
[1:35:04] <@shinsaryn> Oh boi. This could be a problem already actually.
[1:35:04] <%lewdskeletor13> Not the Spencer Estate?
[1:35:06] <pectusumbra> good scout
[1:35:07] <%ElenaManetta> Of course, I've been playing the same file for months and now have reached a point where money is useless and got 1.5 mil with nothing to do
[1:35:10] <%QueequegTheater> Scout Kreygasm
[1:35:13] <pectusumbra> click and drag
[1:35:16] <Worldbrand> It's located next to the Strangereal Estate
[1:35:18] <%joylent_blue> right click
[1:35:19] <%SashaStarshine> @TheWonderfulGako according to Paige he drinks a ton of water
[1:35:21] <captainthunderwolf> Right click?

[1:35:30] <TranquilTurnip> Oh boy, has Pat ever played this before?
[1:35:33] <%QueequegTheater> You have to go both ways anyway
[1:35:36] <+TransporterX7> *copious
[1:35:39] <pectusumbra> oof
[1:35:42] <NumbusPlays> you have to go both ways
[1:35:42] <%QueequegTheater> dig up
[1:35:42] <lizard0tm> Pat's played it only on controller
[1:35:43] <%joylent_blue> TranquilTurnip not really and not in a while
[1:35:43] <ShichiNoBushi> BATTLE-Battle-battle-battle...

[1:35:44] <Dr_Donkey_Brains> gotta go both ways
[1:35:45] <%lewdskeletor13> Rude Chay
[1:35:47] <%Prism_Wing> @corporate_redeemer Pat is Clone Jane, and Paige is Hydro.
[1:35:47] <@shinsaryn> Yeeep

[1:35:53] <TranquilTurnip> @joylent_blue oh boy
[1:35:54] <pectusumbra> OKAY, TECH. IGNORE CURIOS AND STUFF ALONG THE way.
[1:36:01] <+Haarute> Backtracking consumes much less torch, at the very least.

[1:36:08] <@shinsaryn> Fuck books.
[1:36:09] <nutimik> uh oh

[1:36:11] <TranquilTurnip> This might be one of my favorite games

[1:38:36] <cheezbass> you resisted the debuff but not the horror
[1:38:37] <%Mr_Strut> You resisted the debuff, but not the horror
[1:38:39] <%simulationbard> You resisted the debuff not the horror
[1:38:40] <lizard0tm> Resisted damage, not the horror
[1:38:41] <canadadan1991> you resisted the 1st status
[1:38:42] <Kathariya> BlessRNG
[1:38:43] <vrusso99> yeah, that's why you kill that guy ASAP
[1:38:45] <captainthunderwolf> @AngriestPat He has big Dodge, but you'll get him. Horror is a Stress DoT, and he'll be dead soon, so Reynauld will get 9-10 Stress total but no more.

[1:40:36] <%simulationbard> Radint doesn't do anything to drop rates

[1:44:50] <pectusumbra> yeah, they each eat one base
[1:44:51] <$Brother_Coduss> @AngriestPat have you ever thought about playing sunless sea or its sequel sunless skies?
[1:44:53] <Valdorick> I got it guys - what if we just buy land in Cuthulu land with our money, and then flood their market with low cost items!? This a plan to defeat the eldritch horrors.
[1:44:57] <%CerberusDriver> KILL CROSSBOW
[1:44:57] <%joylent_blue> now watch you get bad Hunger procs and starve
[1:44:59] <axelcezar> focus damage
[1:45:00] <captainthunderwolf> @AngriestPat Single room searches at the end of hallways, usually, are a big Hunger proc chance. Always check to see if the 90% check to beat the dungeon lets you skip extra rooms.

[2:02:24] <pectusumbra> it's just harder to remove

[2:02:24] <nutimik> Get rid of Klepto
[2:02:25] <%joylent_blue> its more expensive to cure, thats all
[2:02:25] <captainthunderwolf> @AngriestPat Every character will eventually have 5 Positive and Negative Quirks, so let me be straight with you - it's never as bad as it seems.
[2:02:26] <%ElenaManetta> Is Sanitarium open yet?
[2:02:27] <AggsMK7> That's an easy one to deal with

[2:02:29] <dekkitout> get him out!
[2:02:30] <%DirtyGaijin> @AngriestPat remove Klepto
[2:02:31] <%nictron90> That basically means it's more expensive to cure and probably won't go away on its own

[2:02:39] <CuttleCrow> remove klepto

[2:03:12] <pectusumbra> you can remove or lock in traits and diseases
[2:03:13] <luckysteak> no
[2:03:15] <%nictron90> You can also lock in positive quirks there, but it is expensive
[2:03:16] <canadadan1991> 100%
[2:03:16] <%dimeybot> Yup
[2:03:18] <canadadan1991> nope
[2:03:20] <%qrhysse> hover over the number on the right to see sanity
[2:03:20] <CrimsonFox777> Can only get your shit fixed at the Sanitarium.
[2:03:20] <captainthunderwolf> @shinsaryn Did you know that Kleptomaniac is coded to bias towards showing you a good loot drop being stolen? They went out of their way to make it saltier.
[2:03:21] <lizard0tm> Ye

[2:05:16] <captainthunderwolf> @AngriestPat Other best character. Massive damage, but low accuracy. When buffed and levelled, trivializes many encounters.
[2:05:18] <pectusumbra> self accuracy buff isn't bad
[2:05:19] <DirtyPopcornJ> Leprosy makes you STORNG
[2:05:19] <person181> leper is one of my fave classes
[2:05:19] <NumbusPlays> those moves are trash
[2:05:20] <%QueequegTheater> @AngriestPat Look at his base damage

[2:05:33] <%QueequegTheater> self mark
[2:05:34] <%trnzero> marks you
[2:05:34] <captainthunderwolf> HE gets Marked.
[2:05:35] <%joylent_blue> marks the leper
[2:05:36] <Intolerable> YOURSELF
[2:05:36] <%simulationbard> He gets marked
[2:05:36] <NumbusPlays> no, it targets himself
[2:05:37] <alwayspronking> nono, self mark

[2:05:39] <yourliteraldog> He stronk but thats he can also hit mutiple dudes
[2:05:39] <+dickbuttwoman> "Self: Mark target" Marks yourself!
[2:05:39] <pectusumbra> pull aggro basically
[2:05:42] <+mr_dangus> MARK HIMSELF
[2:05:43] <Valdorick> Lepers are garbage - fiteme
[2:05:44] <+Haarute> Change those Leper skills.
[2:05:50] <yourliteraldog> super tanky
[2:05:52] <JonKhan> certain abilities cause mark effect

[2:06:08] <Intolerable> CONVERT ITEMS
[2:06:08] <Samuel412> Leper is uniquely bad for you, Pat. He's the most RNG based of any hero.
[2:06:10] <%bestwaifuritsu> You can convert using the double arrow at the bottom
[2:06:11] <pectusumbra> next to the picture of crystals
[2:06:11] <pentagrahams> you can exchange at the bottom
[2:06:12] <%joylent_blue> dual Plague Doctor is nice sometimes
[2:06:12] <%TenderBabyBacon> Lepers are the most RNG of classes
[2:06:14] <$SGrim> @Valdorick I don't have too. 100% Leper runs of the game do that for me.
[2:06:17] <vrusso99> you can trade heirlooms to get more of what you need
[2:06:19] <%trnzero> you can trade heirlooms with the arrows by the heirloom bar @AngriestPat
[2:06:25] <+God_damnit_why> Unlocking other skill is in the guild is SUPER IMPORTANT. Gives you the option to build your characters to they style you want
[2:06:26] <%ElenaManetta> Shellder!

[2:06:32] <pectusumbra> makes things better, cost less, and get more slots
[2:06:34] <%dimeybot> @tenderbabybacon the Occultists heal would like a word
[2:06:37] <captainthunderwolf> Upgrading Stress facilities. Oh man, I remember those days.
[2:06:37] <MSN04_Sazabi> Leper is only RNG if you're dumb enough not to build him for ACC
[2:06:39] <OwlLightningMage> Leper misses all the damn time and his other stuff isn't worth it for all the time he's not hitting anything
[2:06:44] <lizard0tm> @AngriestPat Vestal, Bounty hunter, Hellion and Shield Breaker is probably a good b team to bring now
[2:06:47] <%ElenaManetta> im gonna play DD while pat does too... with my CONTROLLER SUCK IT BITCHES
[2:06:48] <%Sphincter_Spelunker> Young Couple sent out Onyx and Cloyster
[2:06:49] <canadadan1991> improves stress and opens slots
[2:06:51] <@shinsaryn> @AngriestPat General rule of thumb for using Heirlooms is to not use them until you need it most of the time.
[2:06:55] <%El_Tacobandito> upgrade guild and blacksmith first to make guys better
[2:06:59] <%simulationbard> I like to take him in for certian bosses
[2:07:01] <canadadan1991> 3 total slots you have 1 each
[2:07:03] <pectusumbra> crests are used for everything
[2:07:06] <Samuel412> Leper is for when you want your enemy to either take no damage at all, or explode.
[2:07:07] <%TenderBabyBacon> @dimeybot very true, but I would put an RNG Heal above big RNG hit
[2:07:13] <%laserbeaming> Leper + Sun Ring + Jester on the back = Never Miss
[2:07:13] <Wibit> Just notice the Free Real Estate... FUCK
[2:07:14] <%ElenaManetta> It's nice to big stack them
[2:07:15] <%QueequegTheater> nope
[2:07:15] <captainthunderwolf> @OwlLightningMage Nah, Focus Ring and Dismas' Head makes him pretty predictable. You do gotta build him for Acc though, that's no lie.
[2:07:17] <%ElenaManetta> And you can upgrade instantly
[2:07:19] <nutimik> Heirlooms for guild, blacksmith, and sanitarium
[2:07:21] <%dimeybot> You *COULD* trade your current resources?
[2:07:23] <%ElenaManetta> No, it doesn't cost turns to upgrade
[2:07:23] <CuttleCrow> using town buildings costs YOU money
[2:07:24] <%ElenaManetta> It's instant
[2:07:24] <lizard0tm> NO
[2:07:27] <+JusTTheGuyYouNeed> nope
[2:07:28] <+brickwall35> no
[2:07:29] <luckysteak> guild and blacksmith!
[2:07:32] <+dickbuttwoman> It's instant pat, no need to.
[2:07:34] <pectusumbra> it's instant, so you can hold them for what you want
[2:07:35] <%QueequegTheater> cheer100 Pat, prioritize the Stagecoach, Blacksmith, and Guild first
[2:07:37] <+JusTTheGuyYouNeed> i say focus on the guild for now
[2:07:37] <lizard0tm> You don't need to upgrade everyweek
[2:07:38] <CuttleCrow> so upgrade when you are about to use them
[2:07:39] <OwlLightningMage> Why would you built Leper for that when you could just bring another character LUL
[2:07:42] <koolkid1208> @AngriestPat Sekiro trailer?
[2:07:47] <pectusumbra> it's just a click like the stagecoach
[2:07:48] <%joylent_blue> Prioritize Guild and Blacksmith, eventually Sanitarium
[2:07:49] <%laserbeaming> You can one shot the final boss with 1 leper and 3 plague doctors
[2:07:51] <AggsMK7> Wait until level 2 and see what you want.
[2:07:53] <@shinsaryn> @AngriestPat Like upgrading all the training stuff is a good idea obviously but, for stuff like Stress heals, don't use it till you need it.
[2:08:00] <OwlLightningMage> Leper can't do that anymore
[2:08:05] <%ElenaManetta> There are other buildings when you unlock blueprints that cost WAY more treasure, so it's nice to horde
[2:08:05] <%joylent_blue> and Wagon obviously
[2:08:06] <OwlLightningMage> They patched the meme out
[2:08:07] <%Sphincter_Spelunker> sipsipDab Is the beep boop from Paige? sipsipDab
[2:08:09] <Zebroneath> Not like Xcom, Pat. Upgrade buildings when you need to.
[2:08:10] <captainthunderwolf> @AngriestPat Prioritize the Guild and the Blacksmith, as you need to unlock the Equipment tiers to level your Heroes' stats, and the Guild unlocks new Skill levels.
[2:08:15] <+JusTTheGuyYouNeed> early game try to focus on the guild and blacksmith
[2:08:17] <CopperTucker> @AngriestPat Dont' listen to the chat, you should be upgrading as soon as you can.
[2:08:20] <%laserbeaming> Oh, they nerfed it? Damn @OwlLightningMage
[2:08:21] <%ElenaManetta> into the DAKREST DUNGEON
[2:08:22] <AggsMK7> Weald time
[2:08:25] <%ElenaManetta> Darkest even
[2:08:33] <%ElenaManetta> KNOWN CHEAT pat?
[2:08:33] <%dimeybot> Upgrade the Meatwagon asap, I mean Stagecoach
[2:08:34] <%Rhinoprotoss> Final boss time
[2:08:38] <MSN04_Sazabi> I bet people shitting on Leper think Hellion is a good character LUL
[2:08:42] <AlasterAngelo> @laserbeaming you can still beat the final boss without losing anybody if you build for it though

[2:40:00] <%Sulliman34> turn heirlooms into deeds for armor upgrades
[2:40:01] <pectusumbra> okay, so the left is what you are giving UP. the right is chosing what you WANT
[2:40:02] <+TeethMuncher> Since could you convert!?!
[2:40:02] <Samuel412> @deepseal44 He's psyching himself up with some EDM
[2:40:03] <%simulationbard> is he usinig a mod that adds that

[2:40:07] <MSN04_Sazabi> @captainthunderwolf I guess Darkest Dungeon is actually set in the Fate universe for this characters to actually be meeting
[2:40:08] <%deepseal44> @Samuel412 Seems legit
[2:40:09] <%JenovasPuppet> When did this convert thing happen???
[2:40:11] <%Sulliman34> worth
[2:40:14] <pectusumbra> so you can give up 12 busts for 8 deeds
[2:40:14] <%GeneralSCPatton> Terrible exchange rate
[2:40:18] <%laserbeaming> Always keep paintings, those are harder to get @AngriestPat

[2:41:38] <SixthSun2> Depends
[2:41:40] <dan_g_v> why isn't Woolie in the couch giggling at everything Pat does?
[2:41:40] <%nictron90> higher cost = more heal
[2:41:40] <%mastertwin2> Is Pat the new Bumble-King?
[2:41:41] <Intolerable> NO
[2:41:43] <%deepseal44> Every style of stress relief has ups and downs
[2:41:43] <lizard0tm> Send religious people to the church
[2:41:44] <%konekoryugamine> Ah geez
[2:41:44] <Lulu19> DEPENDS
[2:41:44] <@shinsaryn> @AngriestPat More money = more stress healing.
[2:41:44] <%JenovasPuppet> How is "It's Fine" not an emote?
[2:41:46] <nutimik> Gambling can steal your trinkets
[2:41:47] <%deepseal44> Generally they're the same if not for quirks
[2:41:47] <fighterman> you can lose trinkets at the bar
[2:41:49] <EASrake> Some are cheaper
[2:41:50] <%simulationbard> cheaper ones heal less stress
[2:41:52] <Endocrom> Some people will only drink or fuck
[2:41:52] <+TeethMuncher> Depends
[2:41:53] <pigeontactician> send the nun to the brothel, pat
[2:41:53] <haisho> at risk of people overindulging in vices no
[2:41:54] <Valdorick> Some people like different things - I think Faithfuls like the church stuff better.
[2:41:55] <count_bob> Send religious people to the church.
[2:41:59] <+ccwettr123> pricer is actually slightly better, but generally not in proportion to price increase
[2:42:00] <dekkitout> what can possibly be better than a visit to a brothel?
[2:42:00] <%konekoryugamine> Also what's this shit with people having sex with Pokemon? I thought that was jsut a weird internet hentai type thing
[2:42:01] <%laserbeaming> They are better, the last one always has a risk reward factor. Events can happen @AngriestPat
[2:42:03] <stiffybiro> it’s fine emote when??
[2:42:04] <sirrice77> The more expensive the better usually
[2:42:04] <foreverN2dust> seeing Pat struggle inside Woolie's wheelhouse amuses me woolieMIRIN
[2:42:05] <RossMirage> Tavern is cheaper but has more risks
[2:42:06] <+linSP> you lose stuff from gambling?
[2:42:07] <+Kilik_> Also some character can only use certain ones
[2:42:09] <CappuccinoGuil> Generally, top is okay, mid is good, bottom is great for stress healing
[2:42:10] <%GeneralSCPatton> Each class likes different things
[2:42:12] <sirrice77> Though some people prefer certain ones
[2:42:15] <%konekoryugamine> Did Plague make a guest apperance in that stream last night or is this all a big misunderstanding>
[2:42:16] <MSN04_Sazabi> @captainthunderwolf And I guess the Musketeer must be from the Three Musketeers, cause she says their motto word for word, and how else would she know it, it can't be just a little nod.
[2:42:16] <dekkitout> well, aside from a clean bill of health after a visit to the brothel
[2:42:18] <pectusumbra> I don't know if that's true, but it can't hurt
[2:42:19] <%joylent_blue> the caretaker can suck a donger
[2:42:21] <FatherGreyBeard> I believe that more expensive ones are more valuable
[2:42:22] <captainthunderwolf> @konekoryugamine Plague's got a new animation about it, so it's a discussion topic at the moment.
[2:42:23] <pectusumbra> that's FINE.
[2:42:24] <%JenovasPuppet> Send Big stress to higher money places
[2:42:25] <+TeethMuncher> @konekoryugamine people been wantin g to bone pokemon for decades
[2:42:26] <%joylent_blue> no its fine
[2:42:29] <Kataguro> It's actually fine
[2:42:30] <SixthSun2> LUL PLAUGE
[2:42:30] <pectusumbra> just don't send her to fight in the tunnles

[2:42:31] <lizard0tm> It's fine
[2:42:32] <OwlLightningMage> That's actually fine
[2:42:32] <Valdorick> Those could be worse - just means she can't go to that place.
[2:42:33] <@shinsaryn> @AngriestPat They're locked in after a set period of time, they're honestly not that bad anyway.
[2:42:33] <%konekoryugamine> @TeethMuncher FOr real?
[2:42:35] <haisho> just means you don't put her into Warrens though
[2:42:36] <%deepseal44> No Pokemon for Canaigres!
[2:42:36] <+namillus> @foreverN2dust We had Woolie in Pat's zone last night, so it's only fair.

[2:42:52] <CappuccinoGuil> Pat, your characters WILL have locked negative quirks, it's impossible to have a fully clean character.
[2:42:53] <@shinsaryn> @AngriestPat You can but it costs more money.
[2:42:53] <%joylent_blue> they're just more expensive to fix
[2:42:53] <%nictron90> You can but it costs more

[2:42:55] <Kataguro> You can. It's just more expensive
[2:42:55] <pectusumbra> you can but it costs a lot
[2:42:56] <sighman55> more expensive
[2:42:56] <+Cavumentum> You can, it's just expensive
[2:42:57] <EASrake> They cost extra to get rid of
[2:42:57] <Valdorick> They get more expensive I thought?
[2:42:58] <TheHamwall125> Just costs more
[2:42:59] <+rooked4> It costs BIG money
[2:42:59] <%Bane_Kaikyo> apatCrazyhand
[2:42:59] <%arancet> you can still fix, just MUCH higher cost

[2:43:01] <TranquilTurnip> It might become something you cant fix easily
[2:43:02] <%DeathsDoom> they cost more to fix
[2:43:02] <Iniudan> No, they are just way more expensive to get rid off
[2:43:03] <qo_op> this one is useless, send it packing

[2:43:09] <%AirlineFood74> @AngriestPat you CAN get rid of them, thye just cost more to remove
[2:43:10] <%laserbeaming> You can fix them, it's costs more, they can't get swapped in for new ones though
[2:43:10] <OwlLightningMage> Stop listening to the wrong people in chat LUL
[2:43:15] <%konekoryugamine> Mean, I can see where they're coming from because Gardevoir LOOKS like a girl, and others are all around there, but why anything with four legs?

[2:43:56] <captainthunderwolf> @MSN04_Sazabi Ah yes, because it's impossible for there to be multiple kinds of references in one game. Direct details naming a character as someone are the same as a line of referential dialogue. All things always mean the same as other things.

[2:45:16] <captainthunderwolf> @AngriestPat First unlock is expensive, level-ups cost less.
[2:45:18] <%king_wragles> From what I can tell, upgrading good characters is like naming your troops in Xcom
[2:45:18] <TranquilTurnip> Once you get going
[2:45:20] <%joylent_blue> its not worth buying, just wait for lvl 1 boys
[2:45:20] <lizard0tm> @AngriestPat That Vestal is literally useless right now

[2:47:03] <foreverN2dust> eaaaaaaohhhhhhhhhhh
[2:47:05] <MSN04_Sazabi> @captainthunderwolf Coming to think of it, even your big reference is just that - a reference. The only thing that Leper and Baldwin have in common is being rulers with leprosy. The rest of Leper's backstory and motiffs (exile, atonement" have nothing to do with Baudoine IV of Jerusalem. But you go on with your Grand Unified Theory.
[2:47:07] <pectusumbra> just click on her so you can set it speci9fically

[2:49:22] <captainthunderwolf> @MSN04_Sazabi Out of curiosity, which setting is DD closer to? Our setting, with Lovecraft, or Trauma Center? Right, Trauma Center, headcanon lul.
[2:49:22] <%SashaStarshine> "Calm-ette"
[2:49:25] <pectusumbra> Absolutely not

[2:49:39] <reddeadwine1277> where is Tarkus?
[2:49:40] <CappuccinoGuil> Helions with Iron Swan and buffs are AWESOME
[2:49:40] <pectusumbra> or if she gets pushed
[2:49:41] <%GeneralSCPatton> @frustratedaf I was more thinking that SpongeBob themed Megalovania remix. I know it sounds cringe, but it's awesome.
[2:49:42] <%joylent_blue> it ended up being a fun joke
[2:49:43] <CuttleCrow> good with other characters that move around
[2:49:53] <qo_op> nope, big frontline
[2:49:57] <Videogamer4> TARKUS
[2:49:57] <pectusumbra> that's fine, he's still good

[2:50:31] <reddeadwine1277> look at that mole on her face yo
[2:50:31] <MSN04_Sazabi> @captainthunderwolf Is Bloodborne also based in our world because it heavily references Lovecraft? Is Dark Souls happening in Berserk universe?
[2:50:37] <Cjs1798> i just got here does music sound weird to anyone else or just me?
[2:50:40] <captainthunderwolf> @AngriestPat Best use for Lunge is with Shadow Fade - Shadow Fade is a big damage and Crit buff, so Lunge can kill back-rows like nothing. Still, she's difficult to use without a mobile party.
[2:50:48] <lizard0tm> YOUR WELCOME
[2:50:51] <foreverN2dust> @Cjs1798 sounds fine to me
[2:50:53] <%deepseal44> *ur
[2:50:58] <%goose_attack_almanac> @AngriestPat Lunge is actually crazy good. But it needs a team that can incorporate moving around like that

[2:51:45] <captainthunderwolf> @MSN04_Sazabi Bloodborne has a lot of characters named after, based on, and designed after real-world people, and also the real world is very close to Bloodborne's setting and has singing aliens in the sky. Forgot how close our world was to DD, excellent argumentation.
[2:51:47] <CuttleCrow> level up first
[2:51:49] <%Typhaeon> Your Resolve level is too low

[2:51:55] <@shinsaryn> @AngriestPat They need to be leveled too.
[2:51:57] <%nictron90> @angriestpat just so you know, highwaymen can be amazing if you give them point black shot + this ability that lets them lunge forwards and gain riposte, it's a fantastic combo
[2:52:01] <%sourceofall> heroes are free, leveling them is not
[2:52:04] <Videogamer4> needs to gain xp

[2:53:13] <MSN04_Sazabi> @captainthunderwolf It also has (as you are arguing) historical figures from before pistols were invented hanging around pistols, and arquebuses, and cannons. I guess leprosy must've made old Baldwin really long-living.
[2:53:16] <%ElenaManetta> i ran INTO THE FANATIC
[2:53:16] <CappuccinoGuil> Gear up, upgrade your heroes, let them be BEEFY, then we can fight the boss

[2:55:55] <dan_g_v> bandages
[2:55:57] <MSN04_Sazabi> @captainthunderwolf Oh yeah, and Abdul Alhazred is the guy from like the 8th century. Must've been a lot of timey-wimey bullshit happening to bring all these people together. This isn't exactly the Man in the High Castle. I'd sooner buy that Baldwin and Alhazred are actully Servants, and the Heart of Darkness is Angra Mainyu, than whatever you're ranting about
[2:55:58] <+xelomaimhov> The strangely attractive fish people?

[3:11:39] <ThespianBarrage> Line of coke? sounds more like a line of Kool-Aid "OH YEAH!"
[3:11:40] <TerraWraith> Lies, we are here for Elmo only
[3:11:40] <%AirlineFood74> @Ner234 yeah
[3:11:40] <mr_slaide> No shit...
[3:11:42] <%Niney_Who> Paige, Pat wants to cheat on you with a giant Fluffy White pokemon with a Jet Engine for an ass
[3:11:44] <turf_wind_and_fire> "ok"
[3:11:46] <@shinsaryn> Yeah, that's DD in a nutshell.
[3:11:48] <%dreamfillah> Kill mobs when you can
[3:11:48] <%laserbeaming> Even on Easy Mode it's kinda tough
[3:11:49] <lemon_lore> has pat ask you to be reshiram yet
[3:11:49] <lokiluko> on bitch mode
[3:11:50] <captainthunderwolf> @Poobumbutt I do recommend the Shieldbreaker DLC, though! She's a great value add. And the Color of Madness DLC doesn't get too intrusive either, but it's mostly there for replay value.
[3:11:51] <DirtyPopcornJ> RNJesus blesses this man.
[3:11:51] <%smoketrash> Paige what else have you voiceacted in?
[3:11:52] <Videogamer4> "ok"
[3:11:53] <Ner234> That's hilarious
[3:11:54] <pectusumbra> keep healing
[3:11:55] <Sitromxe> Stop using multi heals you idiot. Only targeted heals are worth spending an action on.
[3:11:58] <+JusTTheGuyYouNeed> the first few weeks are hell
[3:12:01] <%joylent_blue> its a camera trick
[3:12:02] <foreverN2dust> 2.5D

[3:12:11] <%laserbeaming> It's 2D in a 3D plane
[3:12:13] <%deepseal44> I have been watching Pat's stuff for 7 years, now, and his voice has become more or less a fixture.

[3:16:19] <captainthunderwolf> @TranquilTurnip There is a VERY SMALL amount of variance in their Trinkets. Fun fact, Arbalests roll to replace Arbalests on spawn, which is why you don't just get twice as many of the same unit.

[3:30:55] <+SaurianCrash> I love Paige asking questions
[3:30:56] <+PenmanLupine> There are so many other streamers playing Apex right now, go watch them you chat chodes
[3:30:58] <$Rumbutt> Maybe the real Darkest Dungeon was Battle Royale...
[3:30:58] <%DomunDomunDomun> do tf2 instead

[3:31:02] <%flagi64> @angriestpat can we get a strawpoll?
[3:31:02] <%Sphincter_Spelunker> Apex looks boring as hell to watch. Max was in pro gamer, mouth agape, enemy callout mode
[3:31:04] <%rumtumtugnutz> @TheApostles101 Maybe. Not for a while.
[3:31:05] <MyNameIsRasus> Is there ShindoL mods for Apex? didn't think so
[3:31:06] <%dimeybot> I will give Pat 200 stress if he plays Apex.
[3:31:07] <%AirlineFood74> @AngriestPat PLAY ACE COMBAT INSTEAD

[3:31:17] <yourliteraldog> Woolie died for nothing
[3:31:18] <Ravoric> Darkest Dungeon way more entertaining
[3:31:20] <%Poobumbutt> Apex actually seems kind of cool... despite both Pat and Woolie's efforts to shit all over it. But I don't play dumb multiplayer games, so whatever.
[3:31:21] <nobknee> PLAY LoL
[3:31:25] <TheRageofAfrica> Yeah pat do the Titanfall fortnite
[3:31:30] <yourliteraldog> It actually dose seem fun

[3:31:45] <hussdogrob> Be stronger than Woolie no Apex
[3:31:45] <+TheApostles101> I at least want to see him do the boss before he gets off
[3:31:50] <%Remery_> The Titanfall fortnite without any of the Titanfall movement systems
[3:31:50] <Blaze11592> It's just a slowed down version of titanfall with no wall running or titans
[3:31:52] <%Bane_Kaikyo> Pat is currently being used as a cocksleeve.... by Paigee thee Lupper
[3:31:52] <%FrostMass22> @cthulos They all know what's going on out there. They won't say anything, but they know
[3:31:55] <Cthulos> we had one, it died
[3:31:56] <yourliteraldog> I just sad about parkour robits
[3:31:58] <$thebonebard> @gustavozxd there is a viking one being made called valhal you can find it on indigogo
[3:32:02] <%TenderBabyBacon> I can kinda see that pats RNG aversion is pushing him away from DD
[3:32:06] <%trekkie11041> snake vs soldier battle royal
[3:32:13] <Endocrom> Stay on and show Peach how STRONG Peche is. (Hopefully not killing her in the process.)
[3:32:16] <BayowolfTerra> Whats this song from?
[3:32:17] <UPTONOGOOD18> I wanna see you play apex
[3:32:22] <TheRageofAfrica> But for real the game is really fun and pat really should play it to at least understand why people like it
[3:32:33] <%Sphincter_Spelunker> Boot Loop by F1NG3RS
[3:32:34] <CrypticMochi> They don’t shit on it, they just hate playing in a team

[3:32:42] <MyNameIsRasus> @bayowolfterra Some 80s porn flick
[3:32:45] <%LiquidBinge> ;;^;; I want Pat to keep playing DD, it hurts that he bounced off it twice when the game is literally all MATH
[3:32:45] <%Graywolf_the_45th> I played maybe like half a dozen matches of Apex because everyone was all "IT'S GOOD THO." It is not.
[3:32:45] <+PenmanLupine> Let's take our unique game franchise and strip everything that is unique about it and copy/paste what other games are doing. the suckers will slobbler all over it!" says EA executive. Que slobbering basic bitch masses
[3:32:46] <%Big_Dream> play apex pat is the next ninja
[3:32:48] <BayowolfTerra> Danke schon
[3:32:50] <+mechslayer71> @therageofafrica He’s been playing it
[3:32:51] <gustavozxd> first time I tried starting a match in apex, my game crashed and I fully lost my interest which was already low
[3:32:54] <%QueequegTheater> Play Spec Ops: The Line
[3:33:02] <OwlLightningMage> No titans ResidentSleeper
[3:33:11] <%FrostMass22> How long do you need to play Apex before you like it? Asking as someone who played 3 games and doesn't like it.
[3:33:15] <LeaIsChill> @gustavozxd If you let that ruin your experience, you're missing out
[3:33:17] <yourliteraldog> If pat was ninja I'd be more hopeful for the youths
[3:33:33] <+chrissycht> BATTLE ROYAL BAD
[3:33:39] <yourliteraldog> Play paladins
[3:33:40] <%rumtumtugnutz> if Pat was Ninja I wouldn't be here for this stream because Ninja is a shitlord.
[3:33:41] <%DomunDomunDomun> Apex is only good because the core titanfall gameplay is so good despite all the crap it adds.
[3:33:42] <DreamMondschein> Play the game that your heart tells you to plat.
[3:33:44] <LeaIsChill> Pat with Ninja's influence would break the world
[3:34:04] <%Big_Dream> well ninja has the personality of card board watching paint dried
[3:34:06] <%FrostMass22> But it isn't Titanfall core gameplay because it's nothing like Titanfall.
[3:34:11] <%Big_Dream> dry
[3:34:13] <%NKOrange> wow some of yall really like to hate things just because its popular dont ya apatSmug
[3:34:13] <NJigglypuff> @LeaIsChill or perhaps save it
[3:34:18] <%Sphincter_Spelunker> @FrostMass22 If the focus is more around teams, try a different group of people? Shooters just go bang bang, so that's up to you
[3:34:20] <DreamMondschein> Follow your heart.
[3:34:25] <BayowolfTerra> Pat would never be ninja, which is not abad thing.
[3:34:29] <LeaIsChill> May your heart be your guiding key
[3:34:34] <TerraWraith> So, I feel like doo-doo and still need to work on a paper, so I'm gonna go do that. See ya woopsGottem
[3:34:40] <+mechslayer71> @leaischill Does Crazy Talk scale with the reach of one’s words? If so, Ninja Pat could undo reality itself by acknowledging it.

[3:37:41] <Ravoric> No more Darkest dungeon BibleThump
[3:37:41] <%dimeybot> People that have turned on Respawn for putting out Apex don''t deserve Titanfall.
[3:37:44] <RichAnvils> Paige show feet if you're ok @PeachSaliva
[3:37:46] <%Sotetsu> Play Titan Fall 2. >_>

[3:38:04] <%topendbuzz> @AngriestPat have you seen what lootboxcoins prices at?
[3:38:04] <%Sphincter_Spelunker> People shortening Battle Royale to BR just makes me think of Brazil memes
[3:38:06] <+mechslayer71> @yeknomlive Way better and more interesting
[3:38:07] <%Remery_> Titanfall 3 die for this :(
[3:38:08] <yourliteraldog> Pat your ninja now
[3:38:08] <%DomunDomunDomun> lootboxes and gameplay affecting microtransactions
[3:38:09] <wolf_hurricane> Who needs two jumps when you can have two queer characters LUL
[3:38:10] <count_bob> So.
[3:38:10] <%Nobrev> titanfall 3 is still in development pat
[3:38:10] <%RaikenTB> Paige LUL
[3:38:14] <count_bob> I realized something.
[3:38:15] <%FrostMass22> @dimeybot That's a corporatist argument if I've ever heard one
[3:38:16] <+DeadpanSoupcan> poor woolie
[3:38:19] <bardicfire> sigh Zampella stated they WILL make it
[3:38:19] <+Comrade_Vladof> Titanfall 3 died for this piece of shit
[3:38:20] <@shinsaryn> Respawn, Titanfall 3 cancelled, made Apex instead, we all still think EA is a fuck.
[3:38:21] <MyNameIsRasus> @kitsunemanami yeah but the comments on that video are fuuuuuun
[3:38:22] <TheRageofAfrica> The game that made woolie hollow out live on stream
[3:38:24] <+Redpointshine> No joke, Apex is actually everything I want in a Battle Royale game
[3:38:25] <+Qsmash_> WOOLIE GO DOWN
[3:38:33] <+miyoles> Apex is fun
[3:38:33] <count_bob> Battle Royale games are roguelikes for people who like shooters.
[3:38:34] <haisho> Live Hollowing
[3:38:37] <WeedSpagon> EA probably told them to make APEX lets be real
[3:38:38] <%FrostMass22> They literally said it wasn't in development. Did something change?
[3:38:39] <%Ya_boi_wally > This kills the Woolie
[3:38:42] <VRNK> When Will EA Stop Shooting Themselves In The Foot
[3:38:42] <CuttleCrow> viewer count go down
[3:38:43] <%commanderclaw> @AngriestPat Turn on Streamer mode, it makes the enemy names randomized
[3:38:43] <%Big_Dream> @Nobrev it got cancelled
[3:38:43] <%nademonkey1100> grosss battle royal
[3:38:43] <Kathariya> woolie just ramdomly start crying
[3:38:45] <wolf_hurricane> @count_bob holy shit this is so accurate it's not even funny
[3:38:45] <%smoketrash> "No White Males allowed" the game
[3:38:46] <%SirG005E> sounds like subnautica
[3:38:48] <%MagickBurritoh> YEYEYEYE
[3:38:51] <nobknee> The only game Respawn made that made CASH MONEY.
[3:38:54] <@shinsaryn> Teach it a lesson.
[3:38:54] <bardicfire> like it didn't cancel Titanfall 3, we werent gonna get it for awhile because of the Star Wars game anyway
[3:38:56] <count_bob> I KNOW RIGHT!?
[3:38:58] <Ravoric> Darkest dungeon :D
[3:39:00] <AmericanaRed> I hear APEX
[3:39:03] <hussdogrob> PatJa
[3:39:06] <%Remery_> @smoketrash Diversity
[3:39:06] <$SleepyMaribo> @AngriestPat Apex has issues with OBS for some reason.
[3:39:06] <OwlLightningMage> No titans or fast movement the game ResidentSleeper
[3:39:07] <%rumtumtugnutz> @afronooch I tried to play Fortnife and it's stupid. But PubG was fun for the short time I played it so I think Apex might be alright if the mechanics are tight
[3:39:07] <%VeryTricky> reminder that Respawn WILLINGLY decided to make this game
[3:39:09] <+mechslayer71> It’s fitting that Respawn made the best game in the genre tho
[3:39:11] <%Sotetsu> Which PC platform is Apex on? I hate that I even have to ask that question...
[3:39:13] <Parapattern> >:[
[3:39:16] <bleugh> ape x
[3:39:16] <dekkitout> this game is competent af PogChamp
[3:39:17] <%Sphincter_Spelunker> What Star Wars game? The canceled one?
[3:39:17] <%trnzero> Yeah show Paige what happens to things that disagree with you Pat
[3:39:19] <AmericanaRed> BEST FORTNITE

[3:39:58] <captainthunderwolf> @MyNameIsRasus I think most people's issue is that the one white dude is an asshole, and it feels directed? I'm not really following the issue myself.

[4:56:16] <fruit_pie_the_magician> House centipedes eat other bugs, which means there are enough other bugs in your house to sustain him
[4:56:16] <PSI_Guy95> if you're born on friday 13th you get immunity to demons and Jason
[4:56:20] <Valdorick> Friday the Thirteenth is only bad for you if you're a French Templar.
[4:56:20] <%Afterman_> is he not playing anymore tonight
[4:56:21] <+Ace9817> Probably because you're the murderer in the movie and gain immortality if you're born on friday the 13th
[4:56:22] <+mechslayer71> @dan_g_v It didn’t.
[4:56:22] <%Skeletorexplains> Being born on christmas i think is the lucky one, They always seem to have the best roll in life.
[4:56:25] <hntronium> Just rub it raw
[4:56:27] <%trnzero> I have a pet theory that Paige only appears on Pat's stream to start fights with chat. This fuels her death-resistance.

[5:10:41] <Nordguy> i can't believe Pat didn't brush Elmo, what an irresponsible parent
[5:10:45] <%Remery_> only the robot has grapple hook
[5:10:45] <Valdorick> In before the game automatically puts you into voice chat, and your team can hear EVERYTHING.
[5:10:46] <dekkitout> why not add a character with wall running and a titan for an ult to quiet the babies SeriousSloth
[5:10:47] <GoldySUP> anyone who thinks this game needs wallrun is a bitch
[5:10:52] <+universboy95> What happened to m/kb not being viable?
[5:10:53] <Kataguro> I like this game, but boy is the downtime hard downtime

[5:11:13] <OwlLightningMage> Where is a fucking Titan? WutFace
[5:11:15] <ScreamingMeat> Apex should of had Wall Running
[5:11:17] <Coystick> He screeeemulates for you

[5:11:18] <studleydoorite> just line your couch in brush heads, then Elmo will get brushed every day @AngriestPat
[5:11:20] <+aspirationdeath> No, he meant the domestic violence
[5:11:23] <$bootysteve> !uptime
[5:11:23] <mr_slaide> HE screms.
[5:11:23] <GeneralHysterics> That'd be so obnoxious to get a streamer with open mic as a rando
[5:11:23] <@Moobot> I've been playing this game for how long? Oh only 5h 11m.
[5:11:24] <%KanchouMike> This pacifist run sucks. Paige should wrestle Pat into submission just to give us the blood sacrifice we demand.
[5:11:24] <yourliteraldog> Why would they make on guy egregiously cooler than rest
[5:11:24] <PSI_Guy95> titanfall without the titans
[5:11:25] <Sinister_Aglet> elmo's scat fetish on blast

[5:11:53] <%Engwithan_Elder_God> Where's the mech?
[5:11:54] <%dimeybot> No one is getting wallrun and double jump on this, it'd break the game
[5:11:57] <%KanchouMike> Elmo Screams At
[5:12:06] <pennykettle_> the framerate is dropping really bad
[5:12:07] <Valdorick> Cats are master of the "Bitch, are you for real" look.
[5:12:10] <Kathariya> this game remiding me of halo for some reason
[5:12:10] <tacostarvedbeast> Where is BT?
[5:12:10] <+DavidGarfinkel> Chappie
[5:12:12] <+KamikazeKeeg> Are the frame drops from the stream or game?
[5:12:12] <GeneralHysterics> Would it break the game or make it awesome?
[5:12:15] <pennykettle_> frame drops at your scanner ability
[5:12:17] <$The_CLaUD> @AngriestPat no pat, where's your mech?
[5:12:22] <%Taisuru> @ShichiNoBushi My cat slips into the bathroom to bug people too, they can be pretty quick fuckers
[5:12:25] <pennykettle_> framerate is like sub 20
[5:12:26] <yourliteraldog> I understand the no titans but the wall running would make the game so much more unique
[5:12:27] <+Bathezid> the frame drops are stream, not game
[5:12:27] <PessimisticOptimism> NO WALLRUNNING??
[5:12:27] <+mechslayer71> @ion_laserx Not that at all. And titan fall with titans was an EA game, sooo LUL
[5:12:28] <%FrostMass22> @dimeybot They designed it with those in mind at first. it could work if they actually designed the map well
[5:12:28] <Endocrom> I wonder if this game will get into the moral implications of a robot programmed to take a human life... PFFFFFFFFFFFFFFF
[5:12:30] <%dimeybot> It'd be a MUST have pick
[5:12:30] <%TholD9> Frame drops at everything
[5:12:30] <%GohanEgret> apatPorgmo
[5:12:32] <%KanchouMike> Is the FPS dropping for Pat's face cam, or is it just the game?
[5:12:33] <pennykettle_> @PessimisticOptimism no FeelsBadMan
[5:12:34] <kamig92> hmmmm
[5:12:35] <KaptainKappathe5th> the frames seem really inconsistent
[5:12:35] <Coystick> Non Binary Russian
[5:12:35] <%TheFilth> MOM STOP
[5:12:36] <Mavrick_xg2> Why are people bitching about no titans, it’s not called titanfall ffs
[5:12:39] <kamig92> I wonder if it's the game
[5:12:39] <Finakala> I'm guessing the stream, since Pat said he couldn't see any issues and both Woolie and Billy could play it fine the other day
[5:12:45] <LORDSPOOKLEKINS> @PessimisticOptimism all the cool movement options are gone FeelsBadMan
[5:12:46] <+BishopBain> Yes, scream Elmo. Scream against the world. Kappa
[5:12:51] <kamig92> its well optimized, but turning graphics one level helps
[5:12:52] <%wolfofsound> BabyRage let me play my game mom
[5:12:55] <+king_of_beggars> Mom! I WANT SOME CHOCOLATE MILK
[5:12:57] <hntronium> GIVE ME EYES
[5:12:57] <%FrostMass22> @mavrick_xg2 This game is the reason why Titanfall is dead
[5:13:00] <tag545> pat cant hear the violence to his right
[5:13:02] <zamzoph> leaving your team behind monkaS
[5:13:03] <Weeabooninja> @KaptainKappathe5th It's a twitch thing, I guess
[5:13:03] <%zerocruz> apatPorgmo
[5:13:04] <yourliteraldog> It was TITan fall till ea said make it fortnite
[5:13:05] <Coystick> He Screms because he Hates Apex Legos
[5:13:07] <LORDSPOOKLEKINS> @Mavrick_xg2 because it's what killed titanfall 3
[5:13:09] <%TholD9> Maybe Pat's PC isn't as good as he says it is??? PogChamp PogChamp PogChamp
[5:13:11] <%Engwithan_Elder_God> Seems like a big map. Where's the enemy?
[5:13:15] <%KanchouMike> Elmo's screams are the vocalization of the collective rage of this chat.
[5:13:18] <%dimeybot> @frostmass22 yeah then they playtested it and it was ass on a BR team game where you have to stick together. higher skill ceiling means less player pool
[5:13:19] <+dickbuttwoman> Give ultimate accellerant to lifeline always
[5:13:25] <$The_CLaUD> @Coystick Apex Legos
[5:13:26] <edwonghaupepelutivruskyiv> push all shooting get better
[5:13:31] <GeneralHysterics> Elmo speaks for us
[5:13:40] <%KanchouMike> Elmo is our prophet
[5:13:40] <+mechslayer71> @frostmass22 It’s not dead, and if it was then titan fall 2 doing terribly would be the reason LUL
[5:13:41] <Mavrick_xg2> @frostmass22 funny since this was respawn a idea and they have said a titanfall game (not titanfall 3) is coming
[5:13:43] <%KanchouMike> :pray:
[5:13:50] <%GohanEgret> BlessRNG apatPorgmo
[5:13:50] <%FrostMass22> @dimeybot Yeah. They dumbed it down to make it appeal to everyone. making it shitty.
[5:13:51] <%GarbageNirvana> I don't like going too long without running into anyone, makes you complacent
[5:13:54] <+owo_uwu_owo_my_dude> i always liked games with robits
[5:13:58] <%KanchouMike> BlessRNG
[5:14:00] <ScreamingMeat> The Hypest Gameplay on Twitch
[5:14:00] <arcaderabbit48> At the risk of chat devouring me, this seems pretty okay so far. The map looks good at least, much better than, "giant empty town and fields"
[5:14:05] <lemonhead996> crazy talk incoming?
[5:14:05] <mr_slaide> Time to die!
[5:14:07] <%FrostMass22> @mavrick_xg2 I don't believe that shit for a second.
[5:14:07] <Mudze7> When'd Pat go live anyway
[5:14:10] <Johnso1o> every apex stream is bitchy babies complaining about titanfall 3
[5:14:10] <$WhereDoYouThinkWeAre> How good does it feel to know this game is a success and we get more Titanfall
[5:14:14] <%TheFilth> oh no I actually like the look of this
[5:14:15] <%Big_Dream> R-99 @AngriestPat is over powered
[5:14:18] <%MrBorisMakarov> apatCrazyhand apatCrazyhead
[5:14:18] <@mothmandraws> arcade the game is good
[5:14:18] <dekkitout> out of curiosity, is bloodhound that one character who's "lady wearing lots of armor"
[5:14:19] <%GarbageNirvana> @arcaderabbit48 I mean most folks actually agree
[5:14:20] <LORDSPOOKLEKINS> @mechslayer71 it is dead.They stated that tf3 turned into apex Legends
[5:14:20] <%dimeybot> @frostmass22 you act like Titanfall doesnt exist, let Apex be Apex.
[5:14:21] <+LoganAir> Crazy Talk incoming
[5:14:22] <+Emperor_Bad> im glad fpses have finally dropped the shooting part
[5:14:24] <Weeabooninja> @arcaderabbit48 It shines mechanically and wit h the fantastic ping system
[5:14:29] <%Afterman_> pat behind youuuu
[5:14:29] <CurrySauseBandit> Your own the carepackage
[5:14:30] <+Bathezid> titanfall 3 is not a thing because despite being a great game, titanfall 2 undersold way too much
[5:14:31] <GeneralHysterics> The game is actually pretty good as someone who doesn't care for battle royales
[5:14:33] <@mothmandraws> its more of a "do you liek battle royal" set up
[5:14:33] <+owo_uwu_owo_my_dude> @arcaderabbit48 agreed, less snipeacrossmap-ability
[5:14:33] <Run44forrest> mweow
[5:14:34] <mr_slaide> MEOW
[5:14:35] <chester804> they could use the micro transaction money to fund cool things for TF3
[5:14:36] <%GohanEgret> @Mudze7 5pm cst
[5:14:36] <%FrostMass22> @dimeybot And I don't like Apex.
[5:14:37] <lemonhead996> stay wiht your sqaud
[5:14:38] <+universboy95> Yeah the Titanfall whining is already getting old
[5:14:38] <Mavrick_xg2> Oh no advance movement system that would break map design makes it shitty
[5:14:40] <LunarLancaster> This game is the best BR game on the market
[5:14:44] <Valdorick> I can't wait for it, I can't wait for the worst thing I can think of... "New to Warframe - Plains of Edilon Battle Royal".
[5:14:45] <pennykettle_> Did he do the tutorial?
[5:14:45] <yourliteraldog> Oh no this game looks great I'm just sad no robos with mininukes
[5:14:46] <@mothmandraws> id say this game is the apex of battle royal apatDab
[5:14:46] <%Engwithan_Elder_God> This is too long for a FPS. I don't like constant BS. Is this trying to be a PUBG or something?
[5:14:50] <arcaderabbit48> So how in-depth are the characters? Like full on Overwatch, or what?
[5:14:51] <Endocrom> Is that a dinosaur?
[5:14:51] <$nitronLVIII> Luigi wins Apex Legends by doing nothing
[5:14:51] <%GohanEgret> BIG FPS
[5:14:52] <+mechslayer71> @frostmass22 Big movement in a battle royale removes the tension of the primary mechanic of the game. who gives a shit about the ring when you can outrun it super easily?
[5:14:53] <+ArcLifth> the frames

[5:15:34] <%GohanEgret> ;)
[5:15:35] <+ilasper1> that's a stupid animation lmao
[5:15:35] <+Emperor_Bad> man video games suck
[5:15:37] <shiny_prinny> it comes and goes
[5:15:37] <ScreamingMeat> FUCK that timer
[5:15:38] <+ItsAGundamu> @AngriestPat Adaptive framrate really fucks up the game
[5:15:42] <%myrrdraal1515> That was a bad animation
[5:15:43] <%trnzero> only during drops and abilities
[5:15:44] <%theslippybrit> there are five frames in this game, they were all used for her knockdown animation
[5:15:45] <Smileyhat> I'd just like to point out that Pat fired zero bullets in that game.
[5:15:47] <%Everpresent_Overseer> pew pew pew
[5:15:47] <+UnU__> just when the ult was coming down
[5:15:50] <+tf_pro> Just looks bad when the airstrike was going down

[5:16:01] <missingangle> yikes
[5:16:02] <%theslippybrit> bag cat!
[5:16:08] <GeneralHysterics> How did aimbot miss every shot?
[5:16:09] <%GarbageNirvana> Is there any benefit to doing a finisher over just melee or shooting?
[5:16:10] <sedrictheironic> Mission failed! We'll get'em next time!
[5:16:13] <Coystick> God I wish this was Titanfall
[5:16:15] <%GohanEgret> RIP BIG PUSS
[5:16:15] <%KanchouMike> It appears the whole stream is fuckered and not just the game capture.
[5:16:17] <%dimeybot> @frostmass22 yeah well like it or not Titanfall 3 wasn't about to jump out the ether, we got this and for one I'm happy. Salty Titanfall fans 99% of the time haven't touched Titanfall for years, I played it near daily since launch and I like both.
[5:16:22] <AmaranthSparrow> That SMG sounds like a fart.
[5:16:22] <Run44forrest> how well does this run on ps4?
[5:16:23] <hntronium> You can still be revived
[5:16:30] <%Agami23> this is the first time i've seen gameplay of apex legends. wow this game looks like fucking shit
[5:16:30] <lemonhead996> gg
[5:16:32] <%theslippybrit> youre wrong pat! i know these things i have new glasses!
[5:16:34] <%trnzero> @GarbageNirvana some gear gives bonuses for using a finisher
[5:16:35] <aiyobro> 60fps on ps4 pro
[5:16:42] <%TheFilth> Loot Goblin
[5:16:42] <$TheNeedlesD> it was during the Drop and, during the mortar strike, that the framerate dropped a lot, Pat
[5:16:43] <Weeabooninja> @Run44forrest It's pretty good
[5:16:43] <yourliteraldog> It's actually kinda neat in that your squad can rez you
[5:16:44] <%GarbageNirvana> @trnzero Ah
[5:16:46] <zamzoph> @AngriestPat don't ditch your team this time
[5:16:46] <%RaikenTB> I thought you was the snapshot king
[5:16:47] <%AncelDeLambert> Give it to Paige, let her win the whole thing HER FIRST TIME AGAIN
[5:16:52] <%dimeybot> It isn't trying to be Titanfall, just like Burnout doesn't try to be Forza/Gran Turismo
[5:16:53] <%ironshah> apex>fortnite
[5:16:55] <lemonhead996> Pat's giving us all the "Ooh ah ah sensation"
[5:16:58] <%FrostMass22> @dimeybot I'd rather have something that isn't a battle royale.
[5:16:58] <BayowolfTerra> It looks like a battle royale
[5:16:59] <tag545> pat should smack the lava fish in world for revenge
[5:17:01] <hntronium> I feel that you shouldn't rush ahead too much Pat
[5:17:03] <%Starlight_Gamer> when is paige going to play?
[5:17:04] <@mothmandraws> might be stream based
[5:17:06] <Flame_Water> what happened to ace combat 7, isn't it as good as RE2 remake?
[5:17:09] <ValidVenasaur> Try borderless fullscreen
[5:17:09] <yourliteraldog> So it's not fuck up find a new game lke fortnite
[5:17:13] <%AncelDeLambert> I think it's his capture card
[5:17:14] <%terminallyCapriciousz> i think it's the stream
[5:17:18] <+ChestMimik> Yup this sure is a Battle Royale
[5:17:18] <%dimeybot> @frostmass22 So play Titanfall 2.
[5:17:18] <Champine> pat just sucks
[5:17:19] <+Kilik_> it will be an obs problem, or whatever capture software you are using @AngriestPat
[5:17:20] <Evilkaz> APEX>PubG>Blackout>Fortnite
[5:17:21] <%theslippybrit> paige play?
[5:17:22] <AmericanaRed> Poooound
[5:17:24] <$TheNeedlesD> its probably just streambased shenanigans
[5:17:24] <%GohanEgret> Red Bill should sponsor Paige
[5:17:24] <+king_of_beggars> Maybe your internet is just shitting the bed.
[5:17:24] <aiyobro> do not turn vsync off if your monitor is only 60hz
[5:17:29] <%GohanEgret> BULL* ugh
[5:17:30] <+StromkoPenguin> I didn't notice any frame loss, not sure if because I'm not watching at 60 fps, or because I'm very high
[5:17:34] <+Haruharuharuko> Are you 12? No? Then no your not good at fortnut
[5:17:34] <Sleepology> well that sucks
[5:17:38] <%NWR_James> @AngriestPat LET ELMO PLAY
[5:17:38] <Fabric_tester> Yeah, its usually the capturing that fucks up the stream
[5:17:41] <AmericanaRed> looks good
[5:17:43] <%GarbageNirvana> @GohanEgret Nah you had it right the first time
[5:17:44] <%theslippybrit> @GohanEgret no, bill, go with your insincts
[5:17:45] <Fleshlessnes> does he keep his drink in his balls?
[5:17:45] <edwonghaupepelutivruskyiv> your number 6 in apex on twitch
[5:17:45] <%FrostMass22> @dimeybot And now there will be no Titanfall 3 because Respawn will work on this only if it's successful. also, Titanfall 2 will die with its dying playerbase.
[5:17:46] <Kain5707> @aiyobro just use rivatuner
[5:17:46] <+dickbuttwoman> It's because it's source
[5:17:46] <%ElenaManetta> I thought that was Paige talking
[5:17:50] <%ironshah> honestly i hate fucking br games but this game is extremely fun
[5:17:54] <torontototoro> Elmo will do better than Pat
[5:17:58] <%Engwithan_Elder_God> Magic.
[5:17:59] <LiquidMathew> They don't die
[5:18:02] <%AncelDeLambert> it might be your card, Pat
[5:18:02] <%RioGascar> @angriestpat theres a setting to turn all voice chat into text chat
[5:18:02] <%RaikenTB> consoles?
[5:18:03] <%dimeybot> @frostmass22 Titanfall playerbase tripled this week.
[5:18:06] <Kain5707> @AngriestPat get RivaTuner Pat

[5:18:16] <%theslippybrit> bang a whore and buttgout

[5:20:16] <%dimeybot> Oh so that's what a Vulpix sucking dick sounds like
[5:20:16] <ShichiNoBushi> I was about to ask if Paige was puking but hesitated thinking it would be insensitive.
[5:20:17] <+Haruharuharuko> Pat your wife’s dying behind you
[5:20:17] <+Bathezid> is pat's magnum dong that long?

[5:20:24] <%tiishi> i haven't heard it before
[5:20:25] <OwlLightningMage> It's fine Paige LUL
[5:20:25] <+Larnexea> Are you sure you don't need a DR if those are your Hiccups O.o
[5:20:25] <dekkitout> and it still concerns
[5:20:26] <%Niney_Who> What the fuck is wrong with your diaphragm to make that noise
[5:20:29] <LiquidMathew> Has Pat even got 1 kill so far?
[5:20:31] <+universboy95> Wingman is real good Pat
[5:20:33] <%ElenaManetta> If I lie and tell the stream it was a hiccup, they won't know about my vomit fetish!
[5:20:34] <%couch_potato_Ed_Boy> I have the games V-Sync set to ' Adaptive' but I'm still getting screen tearing after a while of playing. :(
[5:20:36] <+Eclipse_knight_> wtf, how was that death gurgle a hiccup @angriestpat
[5:20:38] <Mudze7> Is it on account of the lupus
[5:20:40] <ShichiNoBushi> Because you litter, Pat.
[5:20:40] <%FrustratedAF> how can this beeeeeeee
[5:20:43] <%Yokuho> I'm level 41 in apex legends, do I have a problem?
[5:20:44] <edwonghaupepelutivruskyiv> pat you gotta shoot em

[5:20:56] <@mothmandraws> pacifist run
[5:20:57] <LiquidMathew> I meant in your entirety of playing
[5:21:00] <+Grimlockfly> Paige is pregnant again
[5:21:04] <%theslippybrit> we all know apex is for bad people
[5:21:05] <%dimeybot> You have a gun Pat, the Wingman is a A-Tier firearm
[5:21:07] <dekkitout> lupus gives +80 to strength, but - 30 to everything else

[5:21:41] <%MrBorisMakarov> DansGame
[5:21:42] <%Remery_> @AngriestPat You see the trick is to keep looting until you find a sniper rifle, and shoot people from afar to minimze the combat, and once you steal a x8 scope you pretty halfway won the game right there
[5:21:42] <ValidVenasaur> nooooooooo
[5:21:44] <TheWonderfulGako> No
[5:21:44] <%ironshah> shotguns op
[5:21:44] <%Clinnamon> trading a wingman for a mozambique, what a legend
[5:21:44] <+JusTTheGuyYouNeed> literally the worst gun in the game
[5:21:46] <%KanchouMike> If we drink enough booze, we can't tell the frames are shit

[5:21:55] <+mechslayer71> PAT NOOOOOO
[5:21:56] <Evilkaz> NOT THE MOZAMBIQUW @AngriestPat
[5:21:56] <+MechaBaphomet> That gun you dropped is one of the best
[5:21:56] <jayteh3> mozambique lel
[5:21:58] <+Robo_Wizard1> Pat just spat in the game's face
[5:21:59] <+universboy95> NotLikeThis
[5:21:59] <stiffybiro> keep the wingman you madman!!!!
[5:21:59] <%Yokuho> no guns yet he makes ALL THE NOISE
[5:22:00] <%theslippybrit> if we drink enough maybe bangalore take clothes off?
[5:22:01] <+Tevvy> replaces the handheld sniper rifle with the worst shotgun in the game
[5:22:05] <%RioGascar> @angriestpat The reason you turn on the text to speech is because at least with that you get the information. with voice chat off YOU GET NOTHING
[5:22:05] <dekkitout> forgive him for he doesnt know, oh father
[5:22:05] <%dimeybot> And Pat wonders why he loses
[5:22:15] <@Moobot> Whoa I don't even shout that much! (@mechslayer71) (warning)
[5:22:17] <%justicevi4> Literally picked up the worst gun in the game NotLikeThis
[5:22:20] <%dimeybot> Traded an A-Tier for the ONLY F-Tier firearm
[5:22:20] <edwonghaupepelutivruskyiv> oh boy
[5:22:22] <%Niney_Who> The wingman is great if you don't miss
[5:22:23] <Cthulos> I swear the framerate was solid on Max's stream, gotta figure out what he does
[5:22:24] <Mudze7> The mozambique is legit the worst gun in the game
[5:22:24] <+Jonmkl> The Wingman is the sh** man... how do you not know
[5:22:26] <Mudze7> Melee is better
[5:22:27] <%GarbageNirvana> Most everyone I play with just pings anyway
[5:22:29] <CrypticMochi> I want him to go on a killing streak with that
[5:22:31] <fabo_joyful> still going? cool
[5:22:32] <%KanchouMike> Pat pls
[5:22:32] <$BuoyantSoul> Pat, you rag on Paige for making piggy noises while she's streaming, but you totally make these weird clicky noises while you stream.
[5:22:35] <+JusTTheGuyYouNeed> first are better than the mozambique
[5:22:35] <mr_slaide> Meeeeeeeeeeooooooooooow
[5:22:35] <%KanchouMike> why did you do this
[5:22:35] <%MrBorisMakarov> BIG SCREAM
[5:22:37] <Bloodninja15> Max was on Ps4
[5:22:40] <+mechslayer71> SHOTTY pistol is the worst gun in the game @angriestpat
[5:22:44] <HanPaul> Precision CHOKE Kreygasm
[5:22:46] <%theslippybrit> a single tier for the frame rate
[5:22:47] <%Typhaeon> Tier lists LuL
[5:22:49] <%Engwithan_Elder_God> So...run around, pick up garbage for 10 minutes, then die in 30 seconds. Great fun!
[5:22:49] <%GarbageNirvana> tbh I'm finding I have better success on the PS4 than I do on PC
[5:22:50] <AtlasMcCoy> Theres only like 10 guns
[5:22:51] <CurrySauseBandit> Not really.
[5:22:52] <Mudze7> Yeah, but they're all pretty good except the mozam
[5:22:53] <+RadiatedImp> F tier firearm for a F tier stream
[5:22:54] <future_famous_person> YES
[5:22:56] <dekkitout> blah blah shotgun, what else is new
[5:23:01] <Bustahhwulf> good guns are the ones youre best with :)
[5:23:03] <Mudze7> Shotgun and a mid-to-long range is your go-to
[5:23:04] <%GarbageNirvana> Probably because I don't have to continually fuck with gfx settings to maintain 60fps
[5:23:06] <mrlastchance1> Huh, I figured there would be darkest dungeon. I'm happy it's this.
[5:23:07] <foreverN2dust> The Mozambique is just as good as it was in TF2
[5:23:09] <%trnzero> the moz shoots only 3 pellets for low damage
[5:23:09] <BinaryShuffle> the weapon is so bad it's become a meme
[5:23:10] <+comb711> All I know is the Mozambique is poopy garbage
[5:23:11] <%GarbageNirvana> And also my mouse does weird things sometimes
[5:23:12] <CurrySauseBandit> Mozan is just utter shit outside of some VERY specific cases as a quick draw.
[5:23:13] <%KanchouMike> F-tier is why we're here. We're all failures.
[5:23:14] <edwonghaupepelutivruskyiv> *flails*
[5:23:14] <+dickbuttwoman> The flatline doesn't have barrel stabalizers
[5:23:15] <%GohanEgret> i'll go home
[5:23:16] <%Yokuho> @AngriestPat You need a PEACEKEEPER
[5:23:18] <Champine> titanfall guns
[5:23:18] <+universboy95> All I know is the Prowler is way the fuck up there
[5:23:18] <foreverN2dust> which is not at all
[5:23:20] <%MrBorisMakarov> Am I seeing bot names
[5:23:21] <%dimeybot> The Mozambique is utter trash Pat, it's a shadow of it's Titanfall self
[5:23:24] <%theslippybrit> poopy pat tier
[5:23:24] <stiffybiro> pat is even throwing his good weapons out to spite the earth
[5:23:24] <HanPaul> Pat playing with friends?
[5:23:25] <%RaikenTB> I"ll go home.
[5:23:26] <%MrBorisMakarov> on the kill feeds
[5:23:26] <Bustahhwulf> pat should make his own tier list :)
[5:23:26] <aiyobro> it's way funner than pubg, no weapons accessory screen breaking up the gameplay
[5:23:28] <%Typhaeon> Can't be worse than the Klobb
[5:23:36] <%Big_Dream> R-99 is best gun
[5:23:37] <+Tevvy> they're almost all pretty decent.. except that one
[5:23:38] <%ElenaManetta> GG
[5:23:39] <AmericanaRed> Devotion is good
[5:23:39] <%GarbageNirvana> It's a shame because alternator was one of my fave guns in TF2
[5:23:40] <foreverN2dust> peacemaker>*>mozambique
[5:23:40] <%ThatGuyfromMars> izzat the cotton candy gun
[5:23:41] <%ElenaManetta> for good gun
[5:23:42] <%theslippybrit> its klobbering time!
[5:23:45] <+JusTTheGuyYouNeed> you are always good with AR
[5:23:48] <+MechaBaphomet> That revolver is super good
[5:23:50] <+RadiatedImp> the Mozambique is fineee, it does like 45 damage. that's great for a gun you only use when you spawn
[5:23:50] <Kataguro> Peacemaker and Wingman good
[5:23:50] <Coystick> If only the characters were cooler I'd play
[5:23:52] <+Robo_Wizard1> Most are fine... just not the mozambique
[5:23:53] <TheWonderfulGako> Peacekeeper is good
[5:23:57] <%Engwithan_Elder_God> Jesus these maps are empty...until they aren't.
[5:24:00] <%riantDeliration> any non-Mozam shotgun is great
[5:24:00] <TheWonderfulGako> G7 scout too
[5:24:00] <%ElenaManetta> boy i sure am in the mood for borderlands
[5:24:00] <%dimeybot> I'll send you a chart?
[5:24:06] <%Big_Dream> R-99 is best ar
[5:24:07] <+JusTTheGuyYouNeed> the only bad one is that one
[5:24:07] <Whiteonyx981> I'd rather use my fists than a Mozambique
[5:24:08] <LunarLancaster> R-130, R-99, Peacemaker, Wingman are the best
[5:24:11] <$nitronLVIII> now that i actually see it this games artstyle really is like fortnite and cod had a baby
[5:24:14] <%Sulliman34> hemlock is pretty decent
[5:24:16] <edwonghaupepelutivruskyiv> no that gun shoots health very bad
[5:24:16] <%NWR_James> @AngriestPat but imagine if that robot were FRENCH
[5:24:19] <%trnzero> I love MRVN too
[5:24:19] <foreverN2dust> @TheWonderfulGako you shit talking my scout?
[5:24:19] <%Yokuho> @AngriestPat a Streamer is doing a challenge to get 5 kills and win using only 2 mozambikes, I have no idea how anyone is supposed to do that
[5:24:20] <%Sulliman34> flatline has awful recoil
[5:24:20] <AtlasMcCoy> The guns are like dicks Pat. The bigger the better.
[5:24:20] <+Salvation122> Ping, dude
[5:24:21] <%dimeybot> @angriestpat I have a chart of tiers/stats if you like?
[5:24:28] <dekkitout> randy, any borderlands 3 on your magic thumbdrive? tajC
[5:24:30] <HanPaul> oh yeah, this is Apex' first weekend; hella level 10s

[5:24:44] <DSD24> Mozambique was good in Titanfall 2 I don’t get it
[5:24:44] <+Verd_254> hemlock single fire is really good
[5:24:49] <+universboy95> That a good one
[5:24:51] <%riantDeliration> you can change fire mode between single and burst
[5:24:52] <%Engwithan_Elder_God> What's it matter.

[5:26:16] <%Engwithan_Elder_God> Yes. As soon as others show up.
[5:26:16] <ValidVenasaur> I think your capture card is dying @angriestpat
[5:26:17] <%s_xylocalsingles> its chugging right now
[5:26:18] <+drwhofan999> its like playing a toster

[5:26:21] <+gael_jebidibah> It's smooth on your end?
[5:26:22] <+Tevvy> @AngriestPat even your webcam's frame rate is going to shit
[5:26:23] <%Sulliman34> try dropping to 1080
[5:26:23] <BayowolfTerra> Yea
[5:26:23] <+McSoliace> your camera is lagging too i think?
[5:26:23] <PSI_Guy95> the fps on stream is fucking TERRIBLE CONSTANTLY
[5:26:23] <carlosmanriquez> that aint good

[5:26:24] <%kewlmyc> apatBig doodFps apatBig doodFps
[5:26:24] <+Salvation122> I mean granted you have FPS problems, but why in the world did you use the SMG there instead of the AR
[5:26:25] <GMN1> [i almost died with those frames drop
[5:26:26] <TheBlankAce> When big visuals happen big drops happen
[5:26:26] <%GarbageNirvana> Might be better off just booting up the PS4 and playing it there
[5:26:27] <%mitchteck> Ohh that bitrate
[5:26:28] <kamig92> change bitrate maybe?
[5:26:29] <Kain5707> @AngriestPat are you dropping frames?
[5:26:30] <%nademonkey1100> this is chuging more than a college frat party
[5:26:32] <stiffybiro> !! STREAM AT RISK !!
[5:26:33] <%LixFury> NEXT SLIDE
[5:26:34] <corruptLuck> @AngriestPat change your bitrate man
[5:26:35] <%TheGreatBamBe> Don't let these 15y/o just shit on you. Show these shit heads what it means when father time fucks you
[5:26:35] <%aishman> Or
[5:26:37] <%Superstarsage> Take that texture streaming down?
[5:26:39] <+mechslayer71> Why does pats stream shit itself? No ones else’s does
[5:26:39] <CloudCircus> Too violent
[5:26:40] <%aishman> You can be like Max and play it on the PS5
[5:26:40] <%KanchouMike> We must drink more, this is the only fix for the low frames.
[5:26:40] <aiyobro> try 1080p maybe
[5:26:42] <%dimeybot> it'll be the bitrate fs
[5:26:42] <+Haruharuharuko> Knock it to 1080
[5:26:45] <lionmanguy> did it just mute for anyone else
[5:26:46] <+dickbuttwoman> @AngriestPat Hemlok is best on single fire. Press B to change fire mode.
[5:26:50] <kamig92> yeah texture streaming could be turned down
[5:26:50] <fruit_pie_the_magician> He's been killed by the same guy both times
[5:26:52] <%aishman> ...PS4 not 5. Holy shit fingers
[5:26:57] <edwonghaupepelutivruskyiv> ps4 would be easier
[5:27:01] <%theslippybrit> pat losing A-tier frame traps
[5:27:02] <%aishman> A bit.
[5:27:04] <%GohanEgret> put it to 360p like classic youtube
[5:27:05] <%ElenaManetta> He means the rate of bits that you'll read donations. I suggest 1 bit to read messages.
[5:27:07] <kamig92> hmm then its the texture streaming
[5:27:09] <%GarbageNirvana> PS4.5
[5:27:14] <dotAmelia> @AngriestPat The drops are only happening during graphically intensive areas.
[5:27:14] <arcaderabbit48> @aishman Well, not PS5 yet, anyway
[5:27:15] <%Engwithan_Elder_God> So, your team got 0 kills. Impressive. :)
[5:27:16] <%theslippybrit> fuck the race war time for frame wars
[5:27:20] <foreverN2dust> @ElenaManetta you are insane, no
[5:27:22] <stiffybiro> put it to 160
[5:27:28] <Fabric_tester> 480p
[5:27:29] <aiyobro> i dunno is the computer capturing???
[5:27:30] <Latch77> @AngriestPat littering gets you lower fps on twitch
[5:27:37] <dekkitout> because quantum wave functions?
[5:27:38] <Powerage98> Didn't Woolie say streaming has no effect on online games? like on this past weeks podcast?
[5:27:42] <ValidVenasaur> your capture card maybe
[5:27:43] <Fabric_tester> Its the capturing I think
[5:27:46] <%theslippybrit> pat totally doesnt love us no more
[5:27:48] <kamig92> medium is fine
[5:27:50] <kamig92> or high
[5:27:56] <%arancet> restart stream software?
[5:28:09] <%RioGascar> @angriestpat while you are at just turn on the speech to text. It gives you information rather than just having it off and losing that info
[5:28:10] <%RaikenTB> Insane texture streaming WutFace
[5:28:11] <Zebroneath> Did a windows update cause a problem again?

[5:28:29] <Kathariya> yo pat! turn off this thing called game mode
[5:28:29] <%GarbageNirvana> I mean the stream has been going for a while, a restart could help
[5:28:29] <alrobot2014> @Powerage98 no that was pat in relation to woolie's problems with performance in anthem
[5:28:32] <aiyobro> we're all trying to figure this out for a free game

[5:37:48] <Vigonept> game looks good >actually playing
[5:37:50] <+macaulayculkin> It looked like you were playing with your younger brother and didn’t want him to know you were letting him win so you fired a few warning shots
[5:37:51] <%FrostMass22> Is it possible to be good at BR? Because I suck at them and, therefore hate them

[5:38:33] <%flagi64> ....
[5:38:35] <+macaulayculkin> Bangalore with that broccoli head
[5:38:37] <%RioGascar> depends on how comfortable you are with the controller
[5:38:37] <%LixFury> every character but the robot looks boring AF
[5:38:38] <Latch77> @AngriestPat that's what happens when your mousepad is a couch LUL
[5:38:39] <+dickbuttwoman> Just get good at mouse pat. It's better in the long run
[5:38:40] <dungpie64> Play Fortnite instead
[5:38:41] <%SirG005E> yeah but once you start getting kills with mouse, you'll get them more and more
[5:38:42] <Kaneis> I think keyboard/mouse is better in the long run Pat

[5:38:47] <Kathariya> use the woolie tech, half mouse half controller LUL
[5:38:47] <+Bathezid> this is on ps4, that way you can be on even playing field

[5:39:44] <+Salvation122> They can't possibly be that stupid
[5:39:48] <+mechslayer71> It’s tied to your account, pat

[5:39:48] <%Big_Dream> @AngriestPat have tried aiming wiht your arm and not your wrist thats good trick for fps on pc
[5:39:48] <+Salvation122> No

[5:39:55] <%theslippybrit> yeh we totally see you crying

[5:45:01] <%ElenaManetta> You ain't playing this game outside of streams, buddy!
[5:45:02] <%theowlfiend> PS4 version is strong btw
[5:45:02] <ValidVenasaur> Your aim isnt actually that. Your game sense is though @angriestpat
[5:45:05] <%FrostMass22> Welcome to BR
[5:45:05] <Latch77> almost got a kill PogChamp
[5:45:06] <JetpackMcQuack> 10 minutes of nothing then you die
[5:45:07] <studleydoorite> that was good shooting, till you ran out of ammo from all the bad shooting
[5:45:10] <+Salvation122> Why in the world would your unlocks not be tied to your Origin account
[5:45:10] <%theowlfiend> Also be aware there's Crossplay in the works
[5:45:13] <+Bathezid> then just dont unlock anything 4Head
[5:45:13] <fmc009> REZ LET'S GO PogChamp
[5:45:13] <%GarbageNirvana> Now why would that happen
[5:45:13] <+mechslayer71> It’s tied to your PSN pat
[5:45:13] <%Tbnero> Xbone crowd is good to play with
[5:45:16] <+universboy95> Fuck it, play with a controller
[5:45:17] <%aishman> Wait why would the PS4 one die??
[5:45:18] <%Niney_Who> She ain't gonna save you
[5:45:20] <+TheUberknife> This makes me wish Pat would stream DoD:S
[5:45:21] <Zeragoth25> if they get your body they can rez you at certain places
[5:45:22] <+macaulayculkin> It would be tied to PSN, Pat
[5:45:26] <orenfel> I think these f2p games are getting smarter with account migrations etc
[5:45:26] <%theslippybrit> yeyeye
[5:45:27] <+macaulayculkin> So it would carry over
[5:45:27] <fruit_pie_the_magician> but this game will be gone in a year anyaway
[5:45:27] <%SirG005E> NO
[5:45:28] <+Tevvy> this guy does not seem interested in saving his teammates
[5:45:28] <%ElenaManetta> WOAH how is Pat playing without touching the controller?!
[5:45:31] <Kaneis> Hey you did really well this time around Pat
[5:45:34] <%aishman> Yeah it's tied to PSN, not the Origin Server.
[5:45:35] <GeneralHysterics> Just remember, don't form attachments, kids. If you never love anyone they can't leave you
[5:45:36] <Mavrick_xg2> It’s just cosmetic stuff though
[5:45:37] <TwistedVerse> is it me or is this game lacking in hype
[5:45:40] <fmc009> PSN has been fine by me, only got like 2 bugs apart from that cool.
[5:45:42] <Kaneis> You hit a solid 3 crits and that's not easy
[5:45:45] <IdiotWithADHDGamer> BOOOOOOOOOO
[5:45:47] <%ThatGuyfromMars> @ElenaManetta he's using a keyboard + mouse
[5:45:50] <JetpackMcQuack> Br is fun, right?
[5:45:51] <+Salvation122> It's a fucking live game
[5:45:53] <%GohanEgret> you won't care at that point, pat
[5:45:53] <%Engwithan_Elder_God> I've seen you better at the COD Battle Royal. You can do this!
[5:45:56] <%theslippybrit> lies ps5 is infinity away
[5:45:56] <+dickbuttwoman> Guy dropped a choked peacemaker?
[5:46:00] <Run44forrest> hey anyone know if fortnite skins are tied to psn? because my ps4 got stolen
[5:46:01] <%mayorrev> i cant believe the PS5 is actually a thing now what the fuck NotLikeThis
[5:46:01] <%FrostMass22> @jetpackmcquack imo, no
[5:46:02] <GeneralHysterics> @TwistedVerse I've heard nothing but hype from this game, except for titanfall fans crying
[5:46:03] <%LixFury> youd think it would be transferable LUL
[5:46:04] <+Bathezid> if the game is still alive by the time ps5 comes out, they will move it
[5:46:04] <eyedol33> You really think you'll still be playing by then???
[5:46:05] <%theslippybrit> ps4 never die
[5:46:07] <Ion_LaserX> Expect the PS5 to come out in the next 4 years
[5:46:07] <LunarLancaster> That's not how online game progess works Pat
[5:46:07] <%theowlfiend> @TwistedVerse Play it for yourself, a good 5-10 matches is a nice way to sample it
[5:46:08] <%Afterman_> you either wont care at that point or your shit will carry over
[5:46:08] <+Salvation122> That's not how that works
[5:46:09] <stiffybiro> this is the guy who’s spent hundreds of dollars on hats for space ninjas
[5:46:10] <Weeabooninja> Isn't it tied to the EA account though?
[5:46:10] <+SWindleFeD> @AngriestPat unless they allow a data transfer from ps4 to ps5 but I don't see that happening
[5:46:11] <dekkitout> elaborate, i actually dont understand
[5:46:11] <bluefooddye> Wouldn't the unlocks be account bounnd
[5:46:14] <fmc009> NO REZ
[5:46:14] <%ElenaManetta> KILLS 2
[5:46:14] <%dave323dave> is it not tied to your origin account
[5:46:14] <Vigonept> its just gonna be an extension, like the accessories the gameboy had
[5:46:15] <%Yokuho> I doubt this game will be still relevant when it comes out
[5:46:15] <$MajorCrasher> that's not how that works
[5:46:17] <zamzoph> I would too
[5:46:17] <+mechslayer71> PSN, Pat. It’s tied to your PSN
[5:46:21] <%Rhinoprotoss> Controller peasant
[5:46:22] <Kathariya> dude ask youself are you going to still playing this game in 2020 LUL
[5:46:22] <%kewlmyc> I don't blame them
[5:46:22] <$MajorCrasher> it's tied to PSN
[5:46:24] <%riantDeliration> smart move honestly
[5:46:25] <%Tbnero> space ninjas cost money too.....
[5:46:27] <Quietshun13> I dunno, this game is pretty fun
[5:46:27] <monstergills> Would it just be connected to your PSN?
[5:46:27] <+macaulayculkin> PlayStation Network, Pat. This isn’t a single player game. Just like Destiny 1, everything carried over
[5:46:29] <%Nobrev> who said the ps5 is coming next year?
[5:46:31] <%ElenaManetta> You'll be too busy playing Warhammer
[5:46:32] <%Rhinoprotoss> But what if I need it?
[5:46:32] <lemonadeicecold> pat dumb dum
[5:46:33] <%theslippybrit> slap the crow
[5:46:33] <eyedol33> The goblins, got it
[5:46:34] <fmc009> the name LUL
[5:46:36] <%CrimsonCore90> space ninja money!!
[5:46:40] <+d00msdaydan> did they say they had the tech to transfer your save to next gen or am i thinking of anthem?
[5:46:43] <orenfel> why apex legends 2 is q1 2020
[5:46:43] <+king_of_beggars> They'll make a PS5 version, Pat.
[5:46:43] <%A_Metagaming_Pigeon> Everyone in here talking like they can tell the future.
[5:46:44] <%ElenaManetta> Ah so that's where the 1000 viewers went
[5:46:45] <@mothmandraws> squad up
[5:46:46] <%ThatGuyfromMars> Pat, are you really gonna care enough about the game to worry about your progress?
[5:46:50] <%theslippybrit> cool now you can see how its done
[5:46:50] <+dickbuttwoman> Go join him and do bad
[5:46:51] <kamig92> SQUAD UP WITH MAX

[5:46:54] <Zeragoth25> everybody is streaming apex
[5:46:54] <foreverN2dust> You should play with max
[5:46:54] <+unclegeorge> Yo pat! What's the song of your intro?
[5:46:54] <%aishman> Play with Max! Play with Max!
[5:46:55] <%dave323dave> don't say maybe look it up
[5:46:59] <dekkitout> isnt ps5 or whatever backwards compatible af anyways
[5:47:00] <zedravan> play with max
[5:47:01] <+Salvation122> There is no way that unlocks aren't tied to your Origin account
[5:47:03] <+detbasil> That's the same reasoning of why you don't use items in RPGs. Im not gonna use it cause I'll need it later even though I realy need it now
[5:47:03] <GeneralHysterics> Pat max squad would be hype
[5:47:04] <%theslippybrit> play warhammer!
[5:47:06] <+abluecardigan> he lives

[5:47:09] <%Breakfast_Megapowers> so is this game the APEX of Battle Royale?
[5:47:10] <waifoong98> Max is on PS4 tho isn't he...

[5:47:13] <Kaneis> Is that new Mechanicus game any good

[5:52:30] <+Donut42> @riantDeliration Sorry, not the twitch names. I meant the in-game names.
[5:52:36] <ItIsSky> napalm is more denial than damage but maneuvering is so ridiculous sometimes, it's not the best
[5:52:37] <TwistedVerse> crazy talk activate
[5:52:38] <Scorian> does Tigtone get better? The youtube original was better than the two episodes i've seen of the show.

[5:54:27] <AtlasMcCoy> Technically pat only has to kill one guy to win if he cowards it out
[5:54:28] <ASadFrog> Bloodhound also seems a bit accentfluid
[5:54:30] <nobknee> There is a skeleton inside you right now. RIGHT. NOW.
[5:54:30] <%ElenaManetta> Can Pat just hide and win the game, for real?

[5:54:56] <Run44forrest> no hes playing solo

[5:55:20] <+JusTTheGuyYouNeed> that is not a lifeline package pat
[5:55:22] <Run44forrest> NO PAT
[5:55:22] <+mechslayer71> @elenamanetta Nah, he has to be the last alive, and squads being mandatory means that two people killing each other off to leave or alone is unlikely
[5:55:23] <kamig92> It has happened to me once
[5:55:24] <+KryptonicDNA> Oh
[5:55:24] <%Breakfast_Megapowers> Am I the killlord?
