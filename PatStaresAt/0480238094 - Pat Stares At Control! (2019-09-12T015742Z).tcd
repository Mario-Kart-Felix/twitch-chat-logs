[0:04:27] <latgeek> fuuuuck. gotta remind him to do mirror when he gets clearance 6. it's THE BEST quest in the game by a long shot imo
[0:04:28] <%Chatterbox1991> MrDestructoid500 i get that the joke is funny and all but, quite frankly i think it's profoundly shity of the CM at Obsidion to not give you an advanced copy of Outer Worlds just because of a typo; it honestly makes Obsidion and Outer Worlds look bad and particularly petty. Did you happen to hear back from them yet? because if they are actually willing to burn a bridge over that, that's super fucked up imo.

[0:19:43] <CMSpunky> Wow Control changed
[0:19:45] <+cvp5127> X
[0:19:48] <%AncelDeLambert> the main question I guess is: "are new characters in this going to be as insanely expensive as DBD's?"

[0:41:22] <al0nem0nster> @RubberFistFight Probbably has something to do with the skeleton's natural repair/existing process involving constantly putting up with gravity. And removing that just causes a backlash effect.

[1:49:59] <%Bane_Kaikyo> D I E I N S E C T S
[1:50:02] <Professor_Rakor> But we have to kill the dark midgets first.
[1:50:02] <cureneckbeard> Is it a Monster Hunter joke
[1:50:08] <%doc_ock_rokc> Wtf is greedfall?
[1:50:13] <Sarl109> Pat WoW classic is literally out, Ragnaros isn't that obscure
[1:50:14] <%Dr_Mooose> dusted
[1:50:16] <%wolfofsound> @InugamiTheHound wolf comes from kenshin and sound is the sound ninjas
[1:50:19] <%doc_ock_rokc> I heard its a replacement of Mass effect but
[1:50:22] <%King_Wolf_Rigger> Bummer about not being interested in Greedfall. It's been fun.
[1:50:25] <%doc_ock_rokc> that tells me NOTHING
[1:50:29] <%FirearmsInstructor> @AngriestPat Paige forgot what she was doing and is looking at skelepron
[1:50:30] <krksobk> it would be a fine game if it were about half as long as it is currently
[1:50:31] <cureneckbeard> Are we playing a game?
[1:50:32] <blackbaron98> pirates and monsters
[1:50:32] <TuxedoNash> greedfall looks like discount dragon age origins and that's okay by me
[1:50:34] <$i_am_therydon> paige barely know how to breathe.
[1:50:34] <%Scottigecko> what?
[1:50:35] <%RubberFistFight> holy balls the framerate and framepacing of this game is SO BAD
[1:50:36] <Badgerconda_> Greedfall looks super meh to me.
[1:50:40] <%ArcanumMBD> @doc_ock_rokc euro jank game by euro jank devs. It's their first pretty good game that isn't terribly bogged down by the eurojank
[1:50:41] <%floralkami> Paige, come back already!!!
[1:50:47] <%ThePuddingDead> this game looks....obnoxious
[1:50:51] <%DedlokPM> @doc_ock_rokc new game from the developers of such jank games like Mars Wr Logs, Bound By Flame, and Technomancer
[1:50:52] <%Scottigecko> I thought you finished streaming when you left the bathroom, that's where the dribble was from
[1:50:56] <8_Bit_Badger> If you think about it you're always streaming to yourself
[1:50:57] <%fatally_furious> REsistance is looking like Crawl rather than Dead by Daylight
[1:50:59] <Ner234> That gun is a delete button LUL
[1:51:01] <%Punchasaur> I love pierce
[1:51:05] <piratemikeahoy> @doc_ock_rokc If you like RPGs with dialouge like Dragon age you might like GreedFall basically

[1:51:08] <%Soul_Intern> LUL
[1:51:09] <%CommanderSqueaks> Why did she unplug it from the charger????
[1:51:10] <%doc_ock_rokc> @ArcanumMBD Eastern Eurojank or western Eurojank?
[1:51:11] <cureneckbeard> Did you update the stream setting to game now
[1:51:17] <RupanSen> did the TGS stuff already happen?
[1:51:18] <%InugamiTheHound> @wolfofsound wolf? I'm trying to remember who was a wolf? I remember matt complaining about wolf in the cave (I didn't watch filler after main plot) and sound ninjas from naruto
[1:51:24] <%RubberFistFight> @cureneckbeard he did yeah, it's changed on my ened
[1:51:25] <%ArcanumMBD> @doc_ock_rokc I think the devs are French
[1:51:25] <%King_Wolf_Rigger> REsistance looks like a more polished Metal Gear Survivor.
[1:51:31] <%ThePuddingDead> ^
[1:51:32] <%Teintstein> did anyone let Pat know that motion blur and film grain can be toggled off now?
[1:51:34] <+arfsm95> @AngriestPat paige or jesse faden in the game?

[1:52:38] <%Luesagna00> "thats really weird" coming from the skeleton loving lady
[1:52:40] <%umbypokochan> no it's because he read the note on the roof and examined the knife and listened to the recording so he doesn't want to drive his car into the lake (even though he can't drive)

[1:53:23] <cureneckbeard> Elmoes Mad x24
[1:53:25] <%JJnAJjohnson> has a skeleton, huge cock?
[1:53:28] <%RubberFistFight> @AngriestPat you're a fucking curmudgeon in your heart dude
[1:53:33] <%FirearmsInstructor> @AngriestPat Is this assessment recent, Pat? Remember, you can reevaluate this conclusion... on like a continuous basis.
[1:53:35] <%NWR_James> Standards are: "Are you Rich Evans" and "Can I pretend you're Rich Evans"
[1:53:36] <+king_of_beggars> That's what his Cardiologist says. "Heart of a 60 year old"
[1:53:37] <Trash_leviathan> pat was born as an old man
[1:53:41] <%floralkami> just go forward...
[1:53:41] <%Teintstein> big weiner, in proportion to rest of body

[1:53:44] <piratemikeahoy> Skeletons don't have dicks tho
[1:53:46] <Habblewater> like a figure 8 around the same 5 meters
[1:53:53] <SlimeSlimeSlime> The length that was meant for his legs relocated to his nether regions upon conception.
[1:53:58] <%Capta1n_H3nry> Here we see a trash goblin and a mustard goblin loving each other very much
[1:53:59] <%Ilpala> no boners only bones
[1:54:00] <Quikanims> i still can't believe Paige unironically wants to fuck a skeleton, i thought it was a joke
[1:54:01] <Xhog1> Just came in. How is this game?
[1:54:07] <%Soul_Intern> @piratemikeahoy Say that to the artists
[1:54:08] <%d00msdaydan> game good
[1:54:08] <%CommanderSqueaks> @piratemikeahoy Depending on the fan lore, they can have magic blue/orange dicks.
[1:54:09] <8_Bit_Badger> Pat does she make you wear a dick the birthday boy shirt in the bedroom
[1:54:15] <%floralkami> @xhog1 literally just started
[1:54:17] <%doc_ock_rokc> Any Artists out there Know a good tutorial on Inking in photoshop. It always makes my works look like it was drawn by a 2 year old!

[1:54:33] <SlimeSlimeSlime> Woah! The destruction of that box is pretty damn awesome!
[1:54:33] <piratemikeahoy> I stand corrected I guess
[1:54:34] <krksobk> oh right the game
[1:54:38] <%RubberFistFight> @doc_ock_rokc no idea, my art always looks like it was drawn by a 2 year old.
[1:54:41] <rainwater739> What's the recap on what the story is so far?
[1:54:41] <%InugamiTheHound> @wolfofsound I think I remember that now.Saito is so fucking cool. Aoshi and Shishio were great characters along with
[1:54:44] <%Punchasaur> secret door was passed
[1:54:48] <%fatally_furious> Mario and Sonic at the Olympics has Tony Hawk Pro Skating LUL
[1:54:49] <Xhog1> Also any plans to stream Daemon X Machina?
[1:54:59] <ZE_Count> wrogn way
[1:55:05] <8_Bit_Badger> Every thing I've heard about this game is basically "I don't know" and "Yeah I guess"
[1:55:07] <%Ne1son> How can this be
[1:55:08] <+purps26> pat is walking in circles
[1:55:12] <%doc_ock_rokc> Fine I'll do it the painterly way that got me yelled at in animation school
[1:55:13] <%wolfofsound> @InugamiTheHound yeah after the shishio arc it was pretty bad, but before so many great characters.
[1:55:15] <%dekkitout> Throwing money at a fire is always an option
[1:55:20] <%FirearmsInstructor> @AngriestPat What setup do / would you prefer? 2 comp or single for streaming?
[1:55:24] <gonzy92> idk I've had alot of crashes playing this
[1:55:24] <KishinGrek> Whens the Tokyo game show?
[1:55:32] <Sphincter_Spelunker> @8_Bit_Badger Do you know what SCP's are? It's that in video game form
[1:55:41] <%BappoSama> What is this, Minecraft?
[1:55:41] <$OranHexthief> yeah no even people with second machines had issues with streaming this game.
[1:55:43] <%Agami23> paige is doing a good job reading donations i see
[1:55:48] <3xgilly> is this MINECRAFT now?!?!?!
[1:55:49] <krksobk> I would love to see some Daemon X Machina, especially after the huge improvements it seems they've made to the FPS
[1:55:51] <+arfsm95> @AngriestPat i like how out of frame you look when paige is not in the cam too
[1:55:53] <%fatally_furious> @kishingrek streams are up so im watching
[1:55:54] <KitsuneManami> @AngriestPat GUNGRAVE GORE
[1:56:00] <%RubberFistFight> @AngriestPat don't have any old pc parts laying around you could cobble together? It doesn't actually take that much cpu grunt to encode the stream, and you already have a capture device, so you're halfway there already. Just gotta make sure it's 4K compliant since you like to play with the big megapixels.
[1:56:00] <KishinGrek> Also do u think will SMTV show up
[1:56:07] <%dekkitout> I swear, if this game has a Nether potal...
[1:56:08] <%Soul_Intern> OH FUCK
[1:56:09] <deviljhojho94> fug
[1:56:11] <transporterthesequel> IT GOT OUT
[1:56:11] <%Laecerelius> Oh, it's one of those things
[1:56:11] <krksobk> uh oh spaghettio
[1:56:12] <Marpolo13> well then
[1:56:12] <%Soul_Intern> NOT THIS THING AGAIN
[1:56:13] <%Kiiper> or you could use synergy or something
[1:56:14] <RupanSen> a video artifact?
[1:56:14] <%NWR_James> Would the steam comp need much in the way of power?
[1:56:15] <ZE_Count> There is a file in that NE part you have to pass the death ball.
[1:56:16] <TalekAetem> da blob
[1:56:17] <Valdorick> Oh good, more of those fucks
[1:56:19] <Djinnazz> oh yeah, those fuck are here.
[1:56:19] <%doc_ock_rokc> Its a concept
[1:56:20] <%Punchasaur> ASTRAL SPIKE
[1:56:22] <Xhog1> I haven’t seen Pat stream any of the demos but hoping to see the full game streamed
[1:56:23] <blaggablag> Couldn't you just run synergy to have the same mouse and keyboard for both?
[1:56:26] <KitsuneManami> NEW GUNGRAVE
[1:56:26] <%shurtal> Be glad youre not on console, it chugs HARD with 5 or more enemies on screen
[1:56:26] <%FirearmsInstructor> @AngriestPat You could just use "Mouse without Borders" and have a single KB/M and switch between them.
[1:56:26] <+Lazyjoules> vinePassive
[1:56:30] <cureneckbeard> it's a scp
[1:56:32] <+arfsm95> @AngriestPat there's actually a program that makes you use a single mouse and keyboard for both computers
[1:56:33] <Marpolo13> tha cant be good
[1:56:34] <%doc_ock_rokc> NEW GUNGRAVE?!
[1:56:34] <%Soul_Intern> apatMenace
[1:56:35] <Trash_leviathan> oh shit its COOL ICE
[1:56:36] <heartlesshealer> Please tell me it can't climb
[1:56:38] <Varadox> You could run Synergy or Input Director.
[1:56:40] <$OranHexthief> there are programs that allow you to use one keyboard for two PC's pat
[1:56:42] <%InugamiTheHound> @wolfofsound I did like the ending theme they used for the filler by l'arc en ciel its so good
[1:56:42] <%Kiiper> no stream Pc should only be around 800 bucks and a maybe 350w PSU
[1:56:46] <ミュウレ4242> they make KMV switches that let you use one set of usb devices w/ multiple PCs.
[1:56:47] <%Soul_Intern> apatMenace apatMenace
[1:56:50] <Habblewater> The Astral Trashbag
[1:56:53] <Varadox> Or just have a physical KMV switch.

[1:57:20] <%RubberFistFight> @arfsm95 that can get a little sketchy though, sometimes it just randomly disconnects or can't "see" the other pc - most of them operate via your LAN and come with all the wonderful networking hiccups that brings.
[1:57:20] <%Punchasaur> Jesus Joel

[1:57:49] <%Calek> in their defense the mold smells really good

[1:59:10] <KishinGrek> Istill have my ps2 gungrave games
[1:59:11] <%Punchasaur> unupgraded*
[1:59:11] <%InugamiTheHound> I love the gungrave anime so much
[1:59:12] <Xhog1> This game looks good. May have to pick it up sometime. September’s a bit nuts for releases right now
[1:59:16] <ミュウレ4242> 8_Bit_Badger, someone who works gaurding mold zombies.
[1:59:16] <%Soul_Intern> WELP
[1:59:21] <%Soul_Intern> THIS IS A PROBLEM
[1:59:27] <%King_Wolf_Rigger> @InugamiTheHound have you played the games?
[1:59:28] <Sphincter_Spelunker> "unpacking" she's just throwing her stuff onto the floor. it's what I do
[1:59:32] <Habblewater> Re-ketchuping the body pillow
[1:59:32] <%FirearmsInstructor> @arfsm95 yea I told him one that I use. I'll tell him about it later if he wants to set it up.
[1:59:35] <8_Bit_Badger> @ミュウレ4242 thats a pretty good point
[1:59:37] <ZE_Count> this area really pretty
[1:59:42] <%InugamiTheHound> @King_Wolf_Rigger no I've only seen the anime
[1:59:43] <%Soul_Intern> woop
[1:59:49] <rosemon5001> you cant kill an astral being
[1:59:54] <ミュウレ4242> where's hellboy when you need him?

[1:59:56] <%Teintstein> this is probably my favorite looking area
[2:00:00] <%Soul_Intern> DEAD
[2:00:00] <8_Bit_Badger> Wait, unpacking? I thought you guys moved like a year ago
[2:00:00] <ZE_Count> remmebe ryour dode pat
[2:00:04] <%floralkami> keep going
[2:00:09] <%RubberFistFight> @AngriestPat I switched from a single PC to a dual PC setup for streaming and honestly? It's absolutely worth it. Mine's kinda complicated due to my desire for 5.1 LPCM audio, and there being no capture card I could find that'd do that, so I have extra devices in the chain to downmix it - but as far as streaming goes it completely negates the "resource war" that happens when you do it all from one. IMHO? Absolutely worth the minor hassle it takes to initially set up.
[2:00:10] <%Soul_Intern> Or not
[2:00:10] <+ididstuff666x> Wait this isn’t the Royal Rat Vanguard game, is it?
[2:00:15] <Sphincter_Spelunker> From her plane trip @8_Bit_Badger

[2:01:39] <deviljhojho94> LMAO He doesnt have the REDACTED he is gonna get the REDACTED ending
[2:01:41] <%velemi> how the hell did he miss the REDACTED?

[2:01:43] <%floralkami> @angriestpat don't worry about it
[2:01:43] <%King_Wolf_Rigger> @InugamiTheHound The anime was so good. That ending made me cry like a bitch when he fought for Harry again.

[2:02:18] <%InugamiTheHound> @King_Wolf_Rigger yeah the ending was so sad. that the original FMA03 are still some of the saddest anime endings I've ever seen.
[2:02:21] <deviljhojho94> @lazaruz95 tomatoDevious
[2:02:24] <%ArcanumMBD> Everyone make sure to beat the horse. The faster you kill it the faster you can keep beating it

[2:02:56] <deviljhojho94> I REDACTED myself today, to see if i still REDACTED
[2:03:01] <ミュウレ4242> there's a little RE and beyond two souls in there, but mostly SCP.

[2:05:05] <$OranHexthief> hourly reminder that all of this is inside a building in the heart of new york city pat rooOWO
[2:05:25] <Habblewater> YOOO
[2:05:27] <deviljhojho94> Fucking new york
[2:05:31] <%FirearmsInstructor> @AngriestPat Are you HEALING them of the possession they're under, or just flat out mind-controlling them with that ability?

[2:05:45] <%Soul_Intern> KILL THE SPHERE
[2:05:51] <%FirearmsInstructor> @floralkami ah I see :)

[2:06:26] <8_Bit_Badger> Man's greatest foe; ball
[2:06:27] <%floralkami> i know it's just a skybox in a game, but the creativity is stunning.
[2:06:28] <%Soul_Intern> FUCK
[2:06:28] <%dekkitout> That is one dead ass sphere
[2:06:30] <%Punchasaur> we need Daredevil, iron fist, luke cage and Jessica Jones to stop these ninjas from mining dragon bones

[2:06:57] <%TheNicholasPotter> TheNicholasPotter subscribed with Twitch Prime. They've subscribed for 5 months! Yo.

[2:07:11] <%flyingavocad0s> @angriestpat there's an upgrade that lets you seize spheres
[2:07:13] <Reanimator83> @punchasaur and then get Canceled
[2:07:18] <Sphincter_Spelunker> @Punchasaur Can't. They're too canceled
[2:07:23] <Sphincter_Spelunker> beat me to it
[2:07:28] <%JJnAJjohnson> MAKE STATIC NOISES OVER THE BLACK BARS
[2:07:30] <%Soul_Intern> The City?
[2:07:36] <%King_Wolf_Rigger> @InugamiTheHound Those are all pretty good so far.

[2:07:40] <%Soul_Intern> As in The City of Dreamers?
[2:07:43] <ミュウレ4242> regular expeditions to rhe'ley cannot be good for anyone.

[2:09:15] <%Soul_Intern> Yeah thats some eldritch speech
[2:09:20] <deviljhojho94> its not ideal
[2:09:21] <ZE_Count> did you ever date the mods?
[2:09:23] <%JJnAJjohnson> yeeaah, it does
[2:09:26] <ActualNobody6400> Astral Chain one isn't great neither
[2:09:28] <%d00msdaydan> i would be fine with it if it had more damn slots
[2:09:28] <%grayjammer> They really should have a way to organise them
[2:09:29] <+Your_heals> Seems like a system from early xbox 360 games
[2:09:33] <ZE_Count> I mean did you update the mods
[2:09:44] <8_Bit_Badger> Just dig around in your bag of metal parts blindly
[2:09:48] <$LulzorGG> so is this game as cool as it seems?
[2:09:49] <%Teintstein> "City"

[2:10:03] <%FirearmsInstructor> @AngriestPat Hey are you HEALING them of the possession they're under, or just flat out mind-controlling them with the ability to switch them to your side?
[2:10:05] <deviljhojho94> you love to see that folks
[2:10:06] <ミュウレ4242> ♪black rock shooter♪

[2:10:13] <%Soul_Intern> ALL OF THOSE EXPLOSIVE FOR A SINGLE PRISM
[2:10:17] <%Soul_Intern> WHAT
[2:10:17] <%InugamiTheHound> @King_Wolf_Rigger seraph of the end was animr amde by AOT. its good vampire anime. Two season and I hope season 3. Season 1 was mostly set and lore dump kinda like Norigami season 1
[2:10:18] <ZE_Count> you cant kill them
[2:10:18] <TalekAetem> R U N
[2:10:19] <%Soul_Intern> THE FUCK
[2:10:21] <%SilvaChariot0133> It comes
[2:10:22] <ActualNobody6400> The voice she hears is an ancient evil yearning to break free, I fucking swear...
[2:10:24] <Valdorick> it wants your dick, run
[2:10:24] <%Punchasaur> I'd take a clunky mod system over the game being half TV show
[2:10:25] <transporterthesequel> It doesn't like that!
[2:10:26] <%Soul_Intern> LIVING SEIZURE
[2:10:27] <+Hilleltaco> That seems bad

[2:10:53] <ミュウレ4242> FirearmsInstructor, they'd want their corpses used as weapons to destroy the thing that infested them.
[2:11:00] <%Soul_Intern> Huh
[2:11:05] <%Teintstein> it's a later area
[2:11:20] <%InugamiTheHound> this rock quarry reminds of rock quarry from fallout 4 LOL
[2:11:31] <%Teintstein> ya, I spent a lot of time climbing up there to figure that out
[2:11:31] <%FirearmsInstructor> @ミュウレ4242 heh, I suppose. I just wasn't sure what the ability is. Are they actually corpses at this point?
[2:11:35] <%Soul_Intern> ITS CLIMBING UP
[2:11:38] <ZE_Count> you can unlock the door on this side
[2:11:50] <Meta_Four> All happy rock quarries look alike. Every unhappy rock quarry is unhappy in its own way.
[2:11:51] <%Soul_Intern> KILL THE LIVING SEIZURE
[2:11:51] <%Futurecity10> That looks like the darkness from monogatari
[2:11:59] <%Punchasaur> you can't kill those
[2:12:04] <+crimsonharvest> noise monster juked
[2:12:09] <Reanimator83> You’ll be coming back here later. Don’t worry if you miss something
[2:12:10] <rosemon5001> shooting at a thing that is in constant flux between dimensions
[2:12:13] <ミュウレ4242> some spooky fart monsters here on planet bismuth.
[2:12:14] <transporterthesequel> Wait MORE THAN ONE
[2:12:14] <Valdorick> Feed it so many bullets it explodes!

[2:12:22] <Sphincter_Spelunker> Are we looking for Lucas Baker?
[2:12:22] <%dekkitout> That wandering ball of seizure looks like it'd fit right at home as a Taken enemy in Destiny
[2:12:23] <%flyingavocad0s> @angriestpat there's a hole at the bottom of central research that has a quest you can do now
[2:12:25] <%Soul_Intern> OH SHIT
[2:12:25] <%King_Wolf_Rigger> @InugamiTheHound I somehow find myself watching stuff that's a bit more obscure. Like Canaan, Noir, Avenger, Sci-fi Harry.
[2:12:25] <%Teintstein> @FirearmsInstructor it's implied that some of the non-floaty / running around hiss are so deformed that they're likely already dead
[2:12:26] <%JJnAJjohnson> fucky wucky
[2:12:28] <thereaperofcrows> What happened to World of Warcraft?
[2:12:30] <%dumemoto> Is this an SCP
[2:12:32] <deviljhojho94> oh its one of THOSE
[2:12:33] <%Punchasaur> they're from a dimension that doesn't have death
[2:12:37] <ZE_Count> throw stuff
[2:12:37] <cureneckbeard> fucky-wucky
[2:12:39] <%floralkami> Pat, you're not killing a fourth-demensional instability with a pea shooter.
[2:12:40] <+Hilleltaco> This feels like the equivalent of that normal cop in Astral Chain just shooting into the void like it'd do something
[2:12:44] <Valdorick> Man, the Blackrock raid is different than I remember.
[2:12:45] <%Soul_Intern> @dumemoto Yes
[2:12:45] <deviljhojho94> Are these the REDACTED ?
[2:12:46] <%Dr_Mooose> uhhhh
[2:12:46] <%Teintstein> pat, you can make them pause by throwing stuff but they're invincible
[2:12:51] <transporterthesequel> Oh they are fighting each other!
[2:12:53] <ミュウレ4242> shooting a glitch in the matrix never works.
[2:12:54] <Pepebotellaw> F
[2:12:57] <%bevyrage> hey aren't those the things that showed up in tutorials for powers?
[2:12:59] <cureneckbeard> SCP = Seizure Cloud Pat

[2:13:06] <%bevyrage> just they didn't have seizure lights?
[2:13:07] <%InugamiTheHound> @King_Wolf_Rigger okay cool. I watch whatever I like at the time.
[2:13:09] <8_Bit_Badger> The problem with interdimensional cosmic horror monsters in video games is that they just look like graphical errors

[2:15:23] <ZE_Count> upgrade quality of mods.
[2:15:24] <%Teintstein> @AngriestPat bump the mod upgrade up and all the mods that are dropped/rewarded also go up

[2:18:18] <%Spydurman> This game needs black subtitles
[2:18:19] <%SammyOVision> @AngriestPat Talk to emily after this for a sidequest
[2:18:19] <ZE_Count> remember to check on girl in room too.
[2:18:24] <%ArcanumMBD> @AngriestPat There's nothing on google or the Control subreddit to indicate construct level increases mod drop tiers. I've only found comments saying mod drops are affected by progress and enemy level (which matches my experience with the game)
[2:18:24] <%Teintstein> @AngriestPat fyi the patch also added toggles for film grain and motion blur in the options
[2:18:25] <noobpsyboticus> b-bruther

[2:18:36] <MONSTR_UwU> monkaS
[2:18:36] <VritraReiRei> @Spydurman it's actually an option you can enable
[2:18:40] <cureneckbeard> lets let him out
[2:18:41] <%floralkami> @8_bit_badger she's speaking to that familiar that keeps shining around her face
[2:18:42] <%Ilpala> protip game designers: don't ever have subtitles against a white background jesus christ
[2:18:42] <%ThePuddingDead> do we really need internal monologue?
[2:18:46] <%dumemoto> hey wait a minute. My name is Dylan
[2:18:46] <Patzzki217> @Spydurman there's an option to put a background on it pat doesnt have it enabled
[2:18:48] <%Soul_Intern> Whatever suits them
[2:18:49] <%King_Wolf_Rigger> @InugamiTheHound Yeah. I kinda miss the cool shit that came from the 80s and 90s, but man anime has gotten better since the early 2000s. Usually something fun to watch every season now which is nice.

[2:19:06] <ActualNobody6400> @Spydurman Black subtitles: Aw shit dawg, we locked yo brotha up tight
[2:19:06] <%CaptainPileDriver> it feels like pat is off center cause he's crammed into the corner
[2:19:07] <%Spydurman> ah ok, I'm glad that optuon exists cause some of these subtitles are impossible
[2:19:11] <%Soul_Intern> SO SHE DOESNT TALK?

[2:19:46] <%ArcanumMBD> @AngriestPat There's nothing on google or the Control subreddit to indicate construct level increases mod drop tiers. I've only found comments saying mod drops are affected by progress and enemy level (which matches my experience with the game
[2:19:49] <ZE_Count> Remember to see if new talk options before leaving pat.

[2:20:23] <GUNxSPECTRE> Is there a Mod-combine system
[2:20:29] <+crimsonharvest> it doesnt really matter you get way way more mats than you ever need
[2:20:29] <%floralkami> @gunxspectre guns nowadays are made with newer, light materials, especially anything military-grade. some reason why the lack of newer bulletproof armor and padding, etc

[2:38:39] <%Luesagna00> hitBOX
[2:38:40] <+ZephynM> Took a lot to jump through a hole 4 times her size.
[2:38:42] <ActualNobody6400> Cue Stamper singing gibberish for four minutes

[2:38:46] <GUNxSPECTRE> House gonna be real mad if you keep doing that
[2:38:53] <%dekkitout> Is there not a Kool-Aid Man ability to crash through walls leaving a silhouette of yourself
[2:38:55] <%Teintstein> @AngriestPat I can't remember how many more of these there are, but there are quite a few in this level
[2:38:56] <%Punchasaur> that's the only one of those I found

[2:39:27] <butthurtdave> this must be where they keep the gamer girl feet
[2:39:28] <Djinnazz> @Capta1n_H3nry The opposite actually.
[2:39:29] <+TNT3Rays> Use ur melee nerd
[2:39:33] <ActualNobody6400> @doc_ock_rokc DOBIDABADEBADABA IT'S A SECRET
[2:39:34] <%Teintstein> it's the whole "ripping down the poster" motif that Faden's always talking about
[2:39:35] <%floralkami> @capta1n_h3nry maybe not cause they said the mold smells sweet and enticing
[2:39:41] <%HyraFukit> Pat people have to fix that
[2:39:41] <%Soul_Intern> Oh hey

[2:43:20] <%SammyOVision> It's like the size of a normal business building on the outside.
[2:43:26] <%42nfl19> "Not to scale"
[2:43:29] <%Soul_Intern> HOW HUGE IS IT?
[2:43:30] <%ArcanumMBD> the building on the left isn't to scale

[2:44:37] <%Spydurman> like he's being fed his lines

[2:53:34] <AmericanaRed> jobzoned
[2:53:34] <Owlboy7> NOT TALKING WITH NPC DansGame
[2:53:34] <+VektorTroika> You get a buncha objects of power in one place and the result is a big OOPS
[2:53:36] <%Teintstein> 18th century
[2:53:39] <%dekkitout> You sure it's not a Decepticon faction?
[2:53:40] <%mh9s> nah it's way after the romans
[2:53:40] <+p4ntless> Panopticon is a sick-ass band
[2:53:40] <butthurtdave> you find the TV and it's just a tv that's volume is permanently set to an odd number and it drives everyone insane seeing that
[2:53:41] <%InugamiTheHound> just like in silent hill: downpour
[2:53:42] <asddsa28> yeah and they remade it today but now its worse
[2:53:43] <%dalmek> and then eventually they'd remove the guards, but the prisoners would still think the guards were there
[2:53:44] <ZE_Count> talk with langston silly
[2:53:45] <+crimsonharvest> Not only that but the guards are out of view of the prisoners, its basically horrible
[2:53:45] <%floralkami> @angriestpat will you be taking a look at the new Blasphemous game soon? it looks like a cool 2d platformer with metal Catholic Crusade motifs and spacing-based (dark soulsey, i guess) combat. the art design has been sick and slick from what ive seen, and the item descriptions seems up your alley
[2:53:46] <%Mr_Pylon> Langston's got more
[2:53:46] <%mrvidicus> They still make them today too. One of them is a maximum security prison that looks MISERAAAABLLLLEEE.
[2:53:47] <%FirearmsInstructor> @AngriestPat The panopticon is a type of institutional building and a system of control designed by the English philosopher and social theorist Jeremy Bentham in the 18th century. The concept of the design is to allow all prisoners of an institution to be observed by a single security guard, without the inmates being able to tell whether they are being watched.
[2:53:48] <%42nfl19> Can you talk some more with the NPC @AngriestPat
[2:53:50] <Dio_TR> ALAN WAKE IS HERE

[3:02:41] <digaogrunge> GOZER
[3:02:42] <%Agami23> isnt this the one that killed little timmy?
[3:02:45] <%JJnAJjohnson> the fridge that brought down the building
[3:02:46] <ミュウレ4242> that one could be watched digitally.
[3:02:47] <%Mr_Pylon> It collapsed a building when no one was watching I think
[3:02:49] <iaraCatunda> just hire guards
[3:02:51] <pillowwasp> It’s gozer
[3:02:55] <+crimsonharvest> haha wow really
[3:02:55] <+Tokanova> yeah come back later
[3:02:55] <%JJnAJjohnson> yup
[3:02:59] <b_ikki> yes so
[3:03:02] <%miguelrod777> F
[3:03:05] <%Cthulos> wait is thata D-class
[3:03:05] <%King_Wolf_Rigger> @Punchasaur I'm assuming its ability is very literal. If you were looking at it through the window, then you'd actually be looking at the window, not it. The window is just clear.
[3:03:06] <%grayjammer> Yeah
[3:03:07] <%Teintstein> kid-killer
[3:03:07] <%mrvidicus> Launch that shit into space.
[3:03:09] <a_mad_dragon> just blink one eye at a time
[3:03:10] <Djinnazz> @AngriestPat He can't blink either.
[3:03:10] <arkv01> is that an SCP fridge?
[3:03:11] <%FirearmsInstructor> @AngriestPat Please elaborate????
[3:03:12] <%Punchasaur> a whole building went down with it inside. only the fridge remained
[3:03:12] <Tisaric> monkaS
[3:03:12] <%BappoSama> The fridge is a nuke
[3:03:13] <Trash_leviathan> i think its 173 as a fridge
[3:03:15] <+crimsonharvest> child-eating fridge?
[3:03:16] <%Louie_Salmon> @iaracatunda Well yeah, but what's gonna pay their 4 salaries? C'mon, gotta keep the lights on here.
[3:03:25] <%NeroInfinite> shadow men
[3:03:27] <Valdorick> Shadow Relm
[3:03:27] <%JGardner88> What do you mean the Fridge brought down the building, is that a SCP?
[3:03:29] <ZE_Count> Some of the escaped
[3:03:31] <Dio_TR> ALAN WAKE
[3:03:32] <%JJnAJjohnson> @crimsonharvest indeed
[3:03:32] <+Rodzzila> That is bullshit. There is no way in Hell in all this time no one had accidentally close both eyes haha
[3:03:35] <ShichiNoBushi> There's a Keter designated SCP is an idol that similarly needs to be observed constantly (blinking okay) or else it will disappear, and the last person to see it will next time he/she isn't being watched will suddenly die and have the idol on top of the corpse.
[3:03:36] <%Cthulos> bye d-class
[3:03:41] <ActualNobody6400> The Nega Scot!
[3:03:51] <%Teintstein> I wonder if you could alternate eyes
[3:03:52] <%TaifuDragon> it specifically snaps their necks
[3:03:56] <%Teintstein> like blink one at a time
[3:04:04] <%TaifuDragon> they don't suddenly die
[3:04:14] <%FirearmsInstructor> JENKINS!!!?
[3:04:18] <ZE_Count> they just die if you wait
[3:04:21] <%Dr_Mooose> did it just kill the other one?
[3:04:23] <Trash_leviathan> yea the idol is 173
[3:04:29] <%TaifuDragon> 173 moves very fast in the time it isn't observed and it breaks your fucking neck
[3:04:32] <%Cthulos> @shichinobushi What?!? That's just like 173!!!
[3:04:41] <%doc_ock_rokc> @FirearmsInstructor I don't think Tesladyne is willing to spare him
[3:04:42] <Djinnazz> @ShichiNoBushi Kinda like that insectoid like creature that can see your brain wave impulses and can hide between the movement of your eyes.
[3:04:48] <ミュウレ4242> this hat in time mod kicks ass.
[3:04:49] <%TaifuDragon> he's talking about 173
[3:04:52] <GUNxSPECTRE> Doesn't that one leak shit-smell secretions or whatever
[3:04:55] <+crimsonharvest> shit I would pay EXTRA for a child-eating feature on my fridge
[3:04:58] <%Cthulos> have you heard of them crying angels from Dr Whozzit!?
[3:05:04] <%FirearmsInstructor> @AngriestPat Can you elaborate on "The fridge that brought down the building"??
[3:05:05] <pillowwasp> I like the one about the sea slug that thinks it was a 18th century adventurer
[3:05:09] <%alexandrecau> it also shits so you're forced to have people wash the place and watch him
[3:05:11] <%FirearmsInstructor> @doc_ock_rokc you're probably correct :P
[3:05:12] <%Cthulos> it's just like that ! ! zoneGasm
[3:05:15] <Kaitepaints> where's peach?
[3:05:15] <%TaifuDragon> it leaks a mix of bodily fluid
[3:05:16] <%Punchasaur> @djinnazz that's fucking nuts
[3:05:27] <Daxalog> @AngriestPat Look at Mike Z's Twitter when you have the chance this would make for a good podcast topic
[3:05:28] <%BappoSama> It's a nuke..

[3:07:19] <%BappoSama> I've always hated those tvs and now i have a reason to hate them..
[3:07:25] <%DukeMoose> no wonder people are switching to netflix
[3:07:30] <ActualNobody6400> parts of this game are too damn dark...
[3:07:31] <%King_Wolf_Rigger> @Fuggins4U NUH-UH Don't wanna!
[3:07:32] <%Teintstein> @AngriestPat once you've cleansed the TV there are collectibles to collect in here
[3:07:37] <%AnIrishPapaya> Just rub a strong magnet on its screen. That'll fuck it up big time
[3:07:40] <ミュウレ4242> and don't cross the streams.
[3:07:40] <%bevyrage> don't you have a flashlight?

[3:08:42] <$lastbreeze> You zooped when you shoulda shooped Kappa
[3:08:43] <+VektorTroika> @AnIrishPapaya Given the average SCP, magnets would likely cause a rapidly regenerating lizard demon idol scuba diver to leap out and kill you by the mere thought of it being remotely concievable

[3:13:58] <%Cthulos> you forget MAGUN from Final Fantasy Unlimited
[3:13:59] <%floralkami> honestly, considering the FBC seems pretty new compared to the age of the SCP Foundation, i think this is there first time dealing with a memetic hazard.
[3:14:01] <%parag0nl0st> parag0nl0st subscribed at Tier 1. 
[3:14:08] <NiktenKing> an hour and 20 until I think

[3:14:48] <%ssjklyco> throw stuff to stun him and shot gun him. repeat
[3:14:49] <+VektorTroika> @pillowwasp it was the flying toasters screensavers from the mid 90s!
[3:14:51] <%Cthulos> go watch it again while you're sick
[3:14:54] <%Kiiper> SCP foundation has been through multiple universe resets right?
[3:14:56] <%Cthulos> it's good
[3:15:03] <%Cthulos> it's great

[3:16:04] <Valdorick> Looks like Pope is getting a promotion!
[3:16:05] <%floralkami> this could honestly have a game series of new other worldly threats and Armageddon events as the premise
[3:16:06] <TalekAetem> Change the channel
[3:16:07] <%Razputin217> TEE VEE
[3:16:09] <duckmeister7> and here comes the game changer
[3:16:11] <%FirearmsInstructor> Remote THOT

[3:16:18] <%Teintstein> get ready for the game to be flipped upside down
[3:16:19] <+VektorTroika> REDACTED boys

[3:16:36] <%FirearmsInstructor> @Teintstein ok fresh prince
[3:16:40] <Sphincter_Spelunker> This game better not pull a "Main Character was the problem all along." She better not be the Hiss
[3:16:47] <%Teintstein> @AngriestPat it's the anchor that's in the safe room down in the active threshold
[3:16:53] <%Teintstein> in the clocks
[3:17:04] <Dio_TR> @sphincter_spelunker guess what you know the plot LUL
[3:17:07] <%King_Wolf_Rigger> I bet she's the Hiss
[3:17:11] <Valdorick> Sphere!? What is this, the shitty miniseries, the Sphere?
[3:17:20] <glorifiedfanfiction> the anchour is an anchour
[3:17:21] <Sphincter_Spelunker> fucking fan fiction
[3:17:22] <%Cthulos> @fuggins4u if you're down for cute kids suffering in anomalous hellholes that are inimical to human life and is beautiful for it, watch Made in Abyss tho
[3:17:26] <%Laecerelius> rub your hands all over the TV
[3:17:28] <%Cthulos> it's better
[3:17:31] <%JJnAJjohnson> lol baby sitter
[3:17:33] <%Cthulos> it's great
[3:17:34] <+VektorTroika> @Sphincter_Spelunker SCP is a copy of The Third Birthday for the Sony Playstation Portable that corrupts other games into using the same plot twist as The Third Birthday

[3:18:00] <duckmeister7> flying does not use energy just do it every where
[3:18:00] <%Mr_Pylon> You can dash too while levitating
[3:18:02] <%Razputin217> that's a time stop

[3:18:23] <+superb_superbia> Hello everyone! How deep into this game is Pat right now? I have it on my wishlist for my birthday next month and don't want to see the WHOLE thing but I'm curious :)
[3:18:26] <%NeroInfinite> Pat you have unlimited energy here
[3:18:26] <Valdorick> Think of all the times you did fucked platforming for a chest chat said "You shouldn't have been able to get that this early" LUL
[3:18:30] <GUNxSPECTRE> Better than the InFamous hover
[3:18:35] <@Fuggins4U> it's like a DEstiny hover jump
[3:18:38] <%flyingavocad0s> @angriestpat it takes no energy and you can dodge
[3:18:41] <+Solutha> its like anthem Kappa
[3:18:42] <+crimsonharvest> you can land easier by looking straight down when youre not sure where the ledge is
[3:18:45] <%Kiiper> @superb_superbia he just hit like 70%
[3:18:46] <%Teintstein> you can also hit a an unlimited amount of times when landing
[3:18:48] <%King_Wolf_Rigger> Adorable sufferng is the best kind of suffering.
[3:18:49] <Trash_leviathan> youre magneto now
[3:18:51] <+superb_superbia> Aw snap
[3:18:56] <%mayorrev> Is this astral chain

[3:19:05] <+SolverCODO> Dash while floating
[3:19:06] <+superb_superbia> Thanks @Kiiper ! I'm outie, don't want to spoil myself any more
[3:19:08] <GUNxSPECTRE> Isn't levitating yourself cheating tho'

[3:19:42] <Dio_TR> ALAN WAKE TIME BOIS
[3:19:43] <%floralkami> I think the garbled mess that you hear from the board can only be interpreted by words they can find in your mind that best suits what they need to say, with those slashs being tossups
[3:19:46] <%Teintstein> @AngriestPat now you can reach some collectibles in the next room

[3:20:05] <%FirearmsInstructor> Why'd he say "OH SHIT!"??
[3:20:07] <%Calek> flying does not take energy

[3:27:00] <+VektorTroika> No that's the water cooler that beams stories into your brain
[3:27:02] <%MachoMadnesss94> @angriestpat from this point on you should always look to see if there are places above you that you could use levitate to explore. That goes for exploring old areas as well.
[3:27:22] <%Teintstein> Subway500 bonus50 because this is probably the only time I'll have platinum'd a game while you're still streaming it

[3:39:29] <%FirearmsInstructor> @AngriestPat That's cheating. Doesn't actually count. Read SCP-173
[3:39:33] <chaos2frozen> he's been there for 24 hours
[3:39:34] <Cherokia666> I've tried doing that, but it's much hard than it sounds
[3:39:34] <+chrishnaw> Doing that for 8 hours gets to you
[3:39:36] <%JJnAJjohnson> shit, i actually didnt think of that
[3:39:37] <%Soul_Intern> @alrobot2014 Nuke
[3:39:39] <heartlesshealer> maybe they tested that and it doesn't work
[3:39:40] <+Tokanova> can you just stay in the air forever?
[3:39:41] <alrobot2014> oh
[3:39:42] <GUNxSPECTRE> lol
[3:39:42] <%TaifuDragon> Closing one eye and then the other doesn't actually work the same as blinking anyway
[3:39:43] <alrobot2014> well fuck
[3:39:45] <CALLthaDoctah> if you squint your eyes almost closed, you don't need to blink at all

[3:41:34] <%FirearmsInstructor> @Cthulos I'd have to double check, but basically 173's rule are only actually self-imposed. It's a game. If you try to cheat with the "wink" / "alternating" strat he's like "well fuck you then" and just kills you.
[3:41:37] <%floralkami> @neroinfinite probably not, considering they dont have to pay anything for infrastructure and energy
[3:41:37] <+SolverCODO> Please dash in the air @angriestpat you can do basically everything while floating

[3:58:39] <%Cthulos> when do they fuck
[3:58:42] <%Soul_Intern> @majindusto Abrupt dimensional rave entity
[3:58:49] <%Cthulos> when is the donkey show
[3:58:56] <+VektorTroika> @king_of_beggars Hee-Haw is the best donkey name. Source: I don't write pony fanfiction
[3:58:56] <yourliteraldog> Some of them are sentient
[3:58:58] <%FirearmsInstructor> @AngriestPat Was that from Langston or whatever the guys name is?
[3:59:03] <%floralkami> @king_of_beggars it's good to have a hobby...
[3:59:09] <$rytyoung> I probably enjoyed myself with this game as much as Alan Wake
[3:59:10] <%Louie_Salmon> So they straight up respond to worship?
[3:59:13] <Shwepie> @Cthulos It's called Donkeys in Space, so probably furry porn.
[3:59:15] <%Scarnehu> hey chat, how was the new THK different from the orignal, i missed it
[3:59:17] <noobpsyboticus> that note is also very applicable to Dylan's situation...
[3:59:18] <rosemon5001> you should really save fridge man before ending the stream
[3:59:24] <%King_Wolf_Rigger> @FirearmsInstructor Call him Fred
[3:59:26] <noobpsyboticus> what with that little cell and all
[3:59:28] <+king_of_beggars> Hee-Haw is too on the nose! Terrible name.
[3:59:28] <%Nina96> can a half eaten burger be a Oops? @AngriestPat
[3:59:33] <%Louie_Salmon> @scarnehu Appeared to be identical
[3:59:40] <%arcaderabbit48> @Louie_Salmon It was alluded to much earleir in the game, but essentially yes. They demand love and attention
[3:59:43] <%Soul_Intern> KICK
[3:59:49] <%Punchasaur> fridge guy is fine
[3:59:50] <$rytyoung> @nina96 if you believe it to be a oops it can be an oops
[3:59:51] <%Stay_Hydrated_Bot> @angriestpat stayhyBottle You've been live for just over 4 hours. By this point in your broadcast you should have consumed at least 16oz (480mL) of water to maintain optimum hydration.
[3:59:52] <Habblewater> Mind control dudes to kick the bad dudes right in the cornhole
[4:00:02] <%Punchasaur> there's no actual time limit

[4:01:52] <deviljhojho94> I mean its not ideal
[4:02:02] <Reanimator83> @angriestpat Pat, you need to look up David Lynch Alphabet

[5:01:28] <%Louie_Salmon> I fucking hate chat, the term "Walking simulator" has literally nothing to do with the simulation of walking. It's a derisive term for a game where you hold forward and there is ZERO gameplay. It is dishonest of you to say that this is not gameplay.

[5:19:10] <Trash_leviathan> a charging station
[5:19:10] <goroke> IT's a player made bridge
[5:19:14] <blaggablag> I like how the design is coded so that all the "good guys" look like a Shinkawa design and the bad guys are basically garbage terrorists
[5:19:14] <heartlesshealer> ohh, power grid
[5:19:16] <%Punchasaur> it sounds like a decepticon
[5:19:19] <%THATGUY_789> is it like a 50cc engine
[5:19:20] <%Kiiper> Yes
[5:19:20] <%sjcodan> YE
[5:19:21] <%mayorrev> FOOTSTEPS
[5:19:22] <CSeriesJTYPE> what do you men what is this game, its a travel simulator
[5:19:22] <%sjcodan> YES
[5:19:23] <falcon101> hmmm
[5:19:23] <%VantomPayne> yes
[5:19:23] <+mrredwednesday> Yes.
[5:19:24] <+Grynovus> Yeah
[5:19:24] <%rubbishbinge> Yes
[5:19:25] <mat2501> it was explained in japanese
[5:19:25] <+ThePich> yes
[5:19:26] <%QaizerArt> YES
[5:19:26] <Sphincter_Spelunker> This is like MGS V without going back to base
[5:19:27] <$rytyoung> no way...
[5:19:27] <nabs2099> honestly I feel like the game is going to have a lot more than what they're showing so far. not to mention you can count on the story being good. idk why people are so upset.
[5:19:27] <falcon101> multiplayer?
[5:19:28] <ShichiNoBushi> Minecraft influence?
[5:19:29] <%Agami23> omg. this game is gonna be VERY different a year after it is out
[5:19:31] <%VantomPayne> you can also rate/like bridges like dark souls messages
[5:19:31] <%NeroInfinite> that was a player bridge
[5:19:32] <artoflec> so, if you fail an encounter with BTs, you get forced into a boss fight? because that sounds fucking awful.
[5:19:34] <%doc_ock_rokc> players can build shit to make the game easier for everyone
[5:19:34] <%Cthulos> is that a vacuum cleaner they recorded zoneSweat
[5:19:36] <%Deekman> this game really is about helping each other
[5:19:36] <Cherokia666> What a weird multiplayer
[5:19:36] <cureneckbeard> Like(s) awarded to gd_yukuko's sign
[5:19:36] <%BioApple> I wonder how permanent those structures are. Is the map huge because players are going to ghost together huge towns eventually?
[5:19:37] <einSynd> You were automatically awarding likes to their bridge and the speed boost sign
[5:19:38] <3dbee> yukiko-san gave the item before
[5:19:39] <+WhatTheFlox> What is up with these Upgradeable Like bridges, that have a leveling system, AND stereo systems, AND laddesr
[5:19:40] <cureneckbeard> that's a player bridge
[5:19:42] <rekkn91> it is? pog?
[5:19:42] <%Deekman> now I get "strand game"
[5:19:44] <availablethor> Wait thi game i multiplayer?

[5:20:03] <%Cthulos> for the bike's audio, that sounds like my central vac zoneThink
[5:20:03] <arkv01> 2 more months until release babee

[5:20:03] <+ktothec99> it's like Dark Souls messages but not trolling
[5:20:05] <%Antoids> yeah "kanban" is "sign"
[5:20:05] <%Punchasaur> kojima said multiplayer would be like spiderverse
[5:20:08] <Run44forrest> MULTIPLE WAYPOINTS Kreygasm
[5:20:08] <+Rodzzila> This game look super good, but borgin as fuck
[5:20:09] <AnDyLV> some of this actually makes me thing of current no man's sky
[5:20:10] <+mrredwednesday> Clap
[5:20:10] <heartlesshealer> that's pretty cool, your marked route doesn't have to be a single straight line
[5:20:12] <lloyddboy> THE SKATEBOARD
[5:20:13] <cureneckbeard> The English on this makes me think they're planning on showing this footage in English at some point
[5:20:18] <+fizzguy47> no shit
[5:20:21] <%sjcodan> no shit
[5:20:23] <+WhatTheFlox> Is this a future where Likes can actually be used as Currency, cause you had a meter earlier with 1600 likes
[5:20:24] <Cherokia666> This is super neat and weird
[5:20:26] <%Monkeyweed21> is this game about influencers
[5:20:26] <+kraajkase> Watching this is somewhat pointless since we dont know what Kojima is saying, unless you know japanese
[5:20:27] <%Cthulos> use it, you like it
[5:20:29] <ZE_Count> What about all the people who lie?
[5:20:31] <%QaizerArt> Oh, that makes a lot of sense. @AngriestPat You create STRANDS into other players realities.
[5:20:34] <$Dutchpotato> it's a social media PogChamp
[5:20:34] <%Divryne> @AngriestPat Dude what if Death Stranding is literally all players just rebuilding America?
[5:20:35] <+WyvernsArentDragons> honestly this looks really relaxing
[5:20:35] <DevinMayCry> This is where we get the memory of Reedus murdering all those Lynels
[5:20:36] <+Yagerme> Soooo no offline mode confirmed
[5:20:36] <%sjcodan> IM GONNA LIE SO HARD
[5:20:37] <+Fynale> @AngriestPat i think there's gonna be a message of the power of connecting ppl though social media
[5:20:37] <%Cthulos> thanks for the patronage
[5:20:37] <+mrredwednesday> "You can go anywhere, this is a game where you can plot your own route"
[5:20:40] <%MightyMaxT> A STRAND game
[5:20:40] <Run44forrest> use CLOUT to buy ITEM
[5:20:41] <+gutlesscoward> rebuilding america, one connection at a time
[5:20:41] <+ktothec99> so is this going to have a thing like the MGSV disarmament thing?
[5:20:41] <3xgilly> I really like this so far
[5:20:45] <%Kiiper> the game is likely built in English first, then dubbed/translated to Japanese
[5:20:47] <%Nina96> 6 years
[5:20:47] <%RantingRavager> "Open World"
[5:20:48] <%Neryl_> What if the real strands were the friends you made along the way:?
[5:20:49] <%bevyrage> lot of people not understanding that japan's public face is almost 20% english now

[5:20:49] <%d00msdaydan> 600 hours
[5:20:50] <blaggablag> Use a bridge enough times they might get a squarespace sponsorship
[5:20:50] <+DrN0rd> IS THE GAME EVEN A GAME
[5:20:50] <UvBenServed> "I hope my bridge goes viral"
[5:20:52] <thenumberj42> at least 30 hours of cutscenes

[5:21:01] <+limongiallo> I thought the baby was in the trunk until he turned around
[5:21:02] <+crimsonharvest> like the 'disarm all the player owned nukes in the world' project???
[5:21:03] <+fizzguy47> this is a game?
[5:21:04] <%King_Wolf_Rigger> More than one, less than a million
[5:21:04] <%sjcodan> What if getting to california isnt even the end of the game
[5:21:06] <%42nfl19> @kraajkase some of the gameplay switches to the english version so we can still parse information.
[5:21:06] <%Deekman> what more do you want them to show? @AngriestPat
[5:21:06] <%DKDiamantes> Rebuild the Whole America, now there's a tag line for a video game
[5:21:06] <DevinMayCry> We might have to slowly work across america together as a playerbase like some absurd noby noby shit
[5:21:07] <Cherokia666> Probably until you disarm all the nukes

[5:23:06] <Tisaric> Those Low Roar songs are fucking amazing and coming across them in game would be heaven
[5:23:06] <%Louie_Salmon> Probably a big slow door that's a hidden loading screen, but it feels like an open city.
[5:23:06] <%sjcodan> DELIVERED MATIERALS TO BRIDGE?

[5:23:12] <Bananassassin> @AngriestPat Watch as this game uses custom characters and only Kojima's character gets to be Norman Reedus. Just gonna be a forum website on crack.
[5:23:14] <%Nina96> is the full song out for this?
[5:23:14] <artificiallynatural> Man this game is such a 180 from all the metal gear action
[5:23:19] <+Movemeister> He'll get to the city and see a sign saying "Gary was here, Reedus sucks"
[5:23:19] <+king_of_beggars> This is our Heaven, and our Hell. This. Is Outer Detroit.
[5:23:21] <Jarvanii> I feel like this is tougher to yell sugoi over than the average gameplay
[5:23:21] <%ThePuddingDead> what the song's name again?
[5:23:23] <%NeroInfinite> ah I wish I could read the runes
[5:23:23] <%SergeEXE> @nekodelic that has to be the best description ever
[5:23:23] <CurrySauseBandit> @TheChillRoom Honestly pretty cool. I'm wondering what the tumble animation looks like upon failure looks like though.

[5:28:45] <cielrayze> I SLEEP
[5:28:46] <%NeroInfinite> apatCrazyhand I also do not get it
[5:28:46] <+verydeeplearning> More confused than ever
[5:28:47] <%republicofu> so whens gameplay
[5:28:48] <RavenHellkite> it's like dragon's dogma but without the pawns
[5:28:48] <$haitchkay> @AngriestPat can we appreciate how fucking *good* the render of Reedus is, peenus and feet jokes aside?
[5:28:49] <%BappoSama> Norman speaking Japanese is the best
[5:28:49] <cureneckbeard> i clapped
[5:28:49] <ZE_Count> My dead baby ghosts keep touching me!
[5:28:50] <falcon101> LUL
[5:28:50] <%Monkeyweed21> Mgs Mpreg BOTW
[5:28:51] <+fizzguy47> and buy the fucking game
[5:28:52] <%XeroSigmaPrime> I dont know if I can justify buying this game yet...
[5:28:52] <+crimsonharvest> i dont feel like i know any more actual facts about the game yet
[5:28:52] <CSeriesJTYPE> what is there not to get, its a hiking simulator
[5:28:54] <%THATGUY_789> I also clapped at the part
[5:28:54] <%Ion_Laser> apatGib
[5:28:55] <Run44forrest> he said "reedus DONT PISS IN THE SHOWER" and norman goes" YARE YARE"
[5:28:56] <artoflec> i think its honestly as boring as it looks, they wouldn't cut gameplay into the same type of gameplay if it didnt take FOREVER to get to the encounters.
[5:28:57] <laderojomelacojo> you hike and deliver. it's that simple.
[5:28:58] <3xgilly> wait can you stand and poop
[5:28:59] <+Grynovus> lirikCOZY
[5:28:59] <Nanomachiner> ITS A FUCKIN STRAND GAME
[5:28:59] <%worldbrand> the stream schedule says there's a 50min gameplay one tomorrow and a 50 min one the day after for voice acting
[5:28:59] <+mrredwednesday> "You connect both people and places"
[5:29:00] <$rytyoung> I nees timefall rain to make it November RIGHT NOW
[5:29:02] <CSeriesJTYPE> you have a map and a destination and the gameplay is "get there"
[5:29:03] <giga_bit> I enjoyed it, but I can already tell that this ISN'T a game for everyone.
[5:29:03] <falcon101> prequel to mgs Kappa
[5:29:05] <%Luesagna00> @angriestpat now lets spend the next hour of paige explaining EVERYthing that just happened
[5:29:06] <rekkn91> A true piece of art! ResidentSleeper
[5:29:07] <arkv01> her braids are fuckin insane
[5:29:11] <$SubjectTea> He seems very happy about his game
[5:29:11] <iris_tepes> neatherlands simulator
[5:29:14] <%ThePuddingDead> why mute the crowd>
[5:29:16] <Wyrmsblood> Japanese clapping is weird
[5:29:16] <%ThePuddingDead> ?
[5:29:17] <Shwepie> I wonder if the penis is actually modeled or not.
[5:29:17] <SlimeSlimeSlime> This girl is the real anime
[5:29:18] <%ShovelJustice21> apatElmo
[5:29:18] <%Monkeyweed21> ALOT of people are going to hate this game
[5:29:19] <falcon101> who knows anymore
[5:29:20] <arkv01> kojima is tired man
[5:29:20] <+fizzguy47> did they, tho?
[5:29:21] <majindusto> IM BUYING THE COLLECTORS EDITION
[5:29:22] <+pkmamsters> i like her hair
[5:29:24] <mat2501> it was pretty clear, especially when the english ver get out
[5:29:24] <ZE_Count> Is there going to be some FF7 or did that already pass?
[5:29:24] <Combat_Data> Did that explain anything new to you?
[5:29:26] <ScreamLord> @AngriestPat No one can fathom Kojima's mind. Not even Kojima
[5:29:26] <+ktothec99> Her braids are 'strand game'
[5:29:27] <%King_Wolf_Rigger> I like the chill atmosphere, and it's gonna be interesting that's for sure.
[5:29:28] <thenononparade> can sam please have her hairstyle
[5:29:28] <+king_of_beggars> You can never tell if a Japanese audience is excited or not.
[5:29:29] <%Virokwet> core gameplay appears to be walking and climbing.
[5:29:30] <Nanomachiner> I think she just asked "WHAT KIND OF GAME IS IT THOUGH" and he literally just hit her with "IT'S A STRAND GAME LOLE" @AngriestPat
[5:29:30] <%Nina96> her hair is nice
[5:29:31] <Sphincter_Spelunker> bloodborne 2
[5:29:32] <Shwepie> @ThePuddingDead Because Japan is polite.
[5:29:33] <%Antoids> the gameplay is simple, but big
[5:29:33] <rytisone> hold on
[5:29:34] <%valriot> That was fucking awfuk
[5:29:36] <arkv01> no defined route
[5:29:38] <+mrredwednesday> "It's super simple but so many small things!"
[5:29:38] <oJxn> @AngriestPat Yakuza 7 trailer time
[5:29:40] <arkv01> you decide how you want to fuck
[5:29:42] <iris_tepes> japanese clap wiith their glow sit5cks which are much biugger than americans
[5:29:46] <%THATGUY_789> dat pig tails is Nek lvl
[5:29:47] <TigerClaws12> twin tail VoHiYo
[5:29:50] <Run44forrest> Sugoi jogo kojima san very Kino
[5:29:52] <%Zaphire_Saucypants> man, chat seems to be pretty split on the enjoyment of this game.
[5:29:52] <+mrredwednesday> "There's never been a game like this"
[5:29:53] <arkv01> through the mountains and the rivers
[5:29:56] <%Monkeyweed21> AMERICA IS THE MICROWAVE HALLWAY
[5:29:59] <TheChillRoom> Death Stranding is going to be an instant buy, if that's what the game is like. I'm in love.
[5:30:03] <SlimeSlimeSlime> Oh no, she has the neck choker, you know what that means.
[5:30:04] <$rytyoung> If you played breath of the wild you'll enjoy breaking Reedus's feet
[5:30:04] <+el_thag> Somebody’s leaked the FF7 demo footage already
[5:30:07] <ZE_Count> Bike
[5:30:07] <Nanomachiner> I just wanna get it on PC, and I'll play it to hell
[5:30:07] <%Punchasaur> why does she sound like the Japanese equivalent of a Jewish mother in law
[5:30:07] <+RAAAAAINMAKER> Are games art yet?
[5:30:08] <Oleai> Mash Square to Manifest Your Destiny
[5:30:10] <+DrN0rd> the only word i understood was playstation so playstation confirmed
[5:30:12] <+mrredwednesday> "Depending on the person there's a completely different playstyle right?"
[5:30:12] <iris_tepes> girl's cute hope she tops me
[5:30:15] <Wyrmsblood> I can't wait to not play this and just watch someone stream it online
[5:30:15] <laderojomelacojo> would be cooler if you could chart your own path through the US instead of just the individual regions
[5:30:15] <Run44forrest> AMERICA IS THE MICROWAVE HALLWAY
[5:30:17] <+Yagerme> Ok I still want to play it. So that’s a thing.
[5:30:19] <%around_40_jobbers> The real baby was the microwave hallways we made along the way
[5:30:22] <+fizzguy47> Is that a choker, or a tattoo around her neck
[5:30:23] <mat2501> can't wait for the PC version
[5:30:24] <%valriot> Now we know why Konami fired Kojima @angriestpat
[5:30:24] <Combat_Data> It's a very wide microwave hallway
[5:30:25] <artoflec> theres just...been so many sony walking games like this already i dont know why this one will be any better.
[5:30:25] <%FirearmsInstructor> 2
[5:30:26] <%Deekman> Put on the Yakuza 7 trailers
[5:30:27] <ZE_Count> She told you
[5:30:28] <%TwinBat> what if
[5:30:29] <falcon101> sans is just a costume
[5:30:29] <+lordsdb> I get it honestly, this is metal gear but this time if you even try to go RAMBO you will lose! But now you have to deal with humans and specters. We still have to see how getting drag in the past works. Cause weve seen gameplay of world war 1/2 so that a whole other element but the main thing is trying to cross america. USA USA!
[5:30:30] <LoliKappa> Sans in Death Stranding PogChamp
[5:30:32] <rekkn91> that 90s neckthingy tattoo'd O_ o
[5:30:32] <Run44forrest> OOPS NO GAME ALL MICROWAVE HALLWAY
[5:30:32] <arkv01> what if heheh
[5:30:33] <%THATGUY_789> Sans undersell
[5:30:33] <Point_Me_At_The_Sky> Utter Vaporware if this lands on PC
[5:30:40] <%Zaphire_Saucypants> Paige is right, Pat.
[5:30:42] <%Louie_Salmon> The idea that getting somewhere simply cannot ever be interesting is really closed-minded.
[5:30:43] <%DKDiamantes> Yeah, you don't wanna miss a Norman Reedus costume @AngriestPat
[5:30:44] <+mrredwednesday> "Wasn't it interesting? how was it?"
[5:30:44] <Drunkengen> THE HALLWAY IS THE MARCOWAVE
[5:30:45] <%ssjklyco> Sans isn't playable
[5:30:46] <+KingLlama1> the true Death Stranding were the friends we made along the way
[5:30:48] <TikanZK> costume of sans =/= sans
[5:30:49] <%ThePuddingDead> i doubt that pat
[5:30:49] <%BappoSama> To be fair, that was 30 minutes after the actual Direct..
[5:30:49] <bigwow135> Get translator in here
[5:30:50] <arkv01> konami has corrupt ass execs
[5:30:53] <iris_tepes> @AngriestPat when's the letter reading
[5:30:53] <%Antoids> what if sans is in death stranding
[5:30:56] <frownystar> Sans in Death Stranding
[5:31:01] <majindusto> I wonder if the song "SILENT HILLS" by Lena Katina is in the game :)
[5:31:02] <%Monkeyweed21> Kojima makes wierd ass overbudget art pieces
[5:31:03] <Nanomachiner> pan out?
[5:31:03] <%THATGUY_789> he's spending our Pachinko money
[5:31:04] <Sphincter_Spelunker> Punch out
[5:31:05] <%ThePuddingDead> zoom out...
[5:31:05] <+Fynale> Pan
[5:31:06] <%FirearmsInstructor> @AngriestPat Pan
[5:31:07] <%MightyMaxT> Rainmaker Pull-out
[5:31:08] <Oleai> How did Kojima pay for this?
[5:31:08] <Wyrmsblood> Still a zoom
[5:31:08] <lloyddboy> mooz
[5:31:08] <rytisone> and made something. Konami made Metal Gear Survive
[5:31:08] <%Keyd00d> unzoom
[5:31:09] <%Dr_Mooose> :O pan
[5:31:09] <%valriot> Pan out LUL
[5:31:09] <%grayjammer> mooZ
[5:31:09] <TurtlesAndTentacles> She's right
[5:31:09] <%Nina96> 1
[5:31:09] <astrophizz> like some 70s movie
[5:31:10] <Namaztak> zoom is the same in or out
[5:31:11] <Valdorick> Close up*
[5:31:11] <LoliKappa> negative zoom
[5:31:12] <+atwitchical> Zam
[5:31:13] <Daigrey> Mooz
[5:31:14] <falcon101> lul
[5:31:14] <Etherealizer> Kojima also kinda screwed over Hayter
[5:31:14] <frownystar> Norman Reedus in Deltarune
[5:31:16] <arkv01> announcing desu stranding pachinkko
[5:31:17] <%Punchasaur> Geoff in undertale
[5:31:18] <TheHeroAppears> boom
[5:31:20] <drakoknight> Truck in/Truck out
[5:31:22] <Run44forrest> just say zoom ou
[5:31:24] <Oleai> The answer is clearly 'Zam'
[5:31:24] <321Continue> the flash?
[5:31:25] <%doc_ock_rokc> There is also the rumor that Kojima did the entire PT demo under the nose of Konami
[5:31:29] <%Hilleltaco> @Louie_Salmon I feel like the people who see nothing in this are the kind of people who would ask why there's so much empty space in Shadow of the Colossus
[5:31:31] <%ssjklyco> Rule is if Kirby cannot take your power, youre not a character
[5:31:32] <+Fynale> norman reedus is getting a nendroid
[5:31:38] <+Order_of_Mystery> i would like to personally disembowel whoever cancelled silent hills
[5:31:41] <%Louie_Salmon> @artoflec Wait what Sony walking games, I literally don't know what you mean
[5:31:44] <arkv01> the nendo will come with detachable peedus
[5:31:46] <falcon101> put norman reedus in smash
[5:31:47] <%Deekman> Kojima probably barely new Hater. He was the NA voice actor not the Japanese one Kojima knew (who was still in the game)
[5:31:48] <SlimeSlimeSlime> Wait, did he spend money he wasn't suppose to? Or did he spend more money than the execs would have liked?
[5:31:53] <librettodude> Kojima got demoted-then-fired because Konami turned into a bottom-line company
[5:31:54] <%Antoids> kojima said 45 minutes, thats about the trailer + gameplay footage we saw
[5:31:54] <cosmicgoatee> to be honest theres 2 more days of this pat
[5:32:04] <fIashman92> Nugget's back for Yakuza 7
[5:32:06] <+crimsonharvest> the ambiance really reminds me of the quiet parts of Super Metroid
[5:32:06] <%Dr_Mooose> both?
[5:32:06] <LORDSPOOKLEKINS> yes
[5:32:09] <frownystar> He’s running out of fluff to ride the hype
[5:32:12] <%Punchasaur> her hair looks like anal beads
[5:32:12] <%Monkeyweed21> the boss fight is your punishment
[5:32:18] <Animorphimagi> Cant paige tell us what they're saying right now?
[5:32:20] <+crimsonharvest> he was showing off features tho
[5:32:20] <arkv01> @Punchasaur yamero
[5:32:21] <+RAAAAAINMAKER> Like My Bridge
[5:32:23] <rytisone> you can avoid it easier maybe
[5:32:30] <%TheBlankAce> The punishment for getting caught is fighting a boss
[5:32:30] <%Monkeyweed21> losing the boss fight removes that area from the map
[5:32:31] <Valdorick> Or REWARD
[5:32:33] <%42nfl19> the hands dragged you into that boss fight @angriestpat
[5:32:35] <rekkn91> shoes
[5:32:36] <%THATGUY_789> punished pat
[5:32:39] <%Antoids> you have to pay the boss in your own blood if you fuck up
[5:32:40] <Wyrmsblood> I want to see the story but the game looks like butt
[5:32:42] <+Yagerme> WE DONT KNOW!
[5:32:43] <+lordsdb> He missed tieing up 2/3 ghosts that was near by
[5:32:45] <mat2501> Just wait for the translation of this
[5:32:46] <%Luesagna00> wow look at his fucking shoes
[5:32:46] <iris_tepes> hey Pat, ever thought 0of trying Rainbow
[5:32:46] <%Louie_Salmon> @hilleltaco Yep. That's exactly it, this is shadow of the colossus, except even less about the destination
[5:32:47] <Cherokia666> I think he was just showing off what you can do in the game, not fi you should or not
[5:32:49] <+Rodzzila> So this is the sequel to Dear Esther? Kappa
[5:32:54] <falcon101> who?
[5:32:55] <ZE_Count> Clear you nose!
[5:32:57] <%Nina96> who that?

[5:33:01] <SlimeSlimeSlime> Hello... Asian man.
[5:33:01] <+mrredwednesday> People that helped him make the game
[5:33:02] <arkv01> Kojimas boy toy?
[5:33:04] <artoflec> @Louie_Salmon like horizon and GOW and inevitably what last of us and tsushima will be, lots of walking and being interrupted by cutscenes with small pockets of gameplay and maybe a boss fight if you're lucky
[5:33:04] <Run44forrest> Kojima 2?
[5:33:09] <iris_tepes> his son he accuired after mgs4\
[5:33:11] <Blurredborderlines> it's a game about making connections, fighting people would seem counterproductive to the theme of the game
[5:33:11] <%FirearmsInstructor> @AngriestPat Night man. Thanks for the stream.

[5:33:38] <+lordsdb> Night FIrearm
[5:33:38] <frownystar> Dear Esther would have been a good game if you had to set up climbing equipment
[5:33:38] <%Antoids> they had food and talked
[5:33:38] <%Keyd00d> why do you say that?
[5:33:39] <+DrN0rd> im still very confused

[5:33:56] <%Kiiper> @mrredwednesday thanks for the rundown.
[5:33:57] <+Yagerme> Two timing bitch
[5:34:01] <Dio_TR> MGS 5 WAS SHIT
[5:34:07] <CSeriesJTYPE> if "gameplay" to you is just violence then yeah maybe dont play this because the premise was always alternatives to violence from the beginning
[5:34:11] <artoflec> when it got to combat i was interested but the fact it slowed down for almost every action you did was really annoying.

[5:36:44] <%Louie_Salmon> @artoflec I can see the comparison between all those, but that's really cynical. Those all have interesting stuff that aren't the cutscenes you're walking between, and I don't see why this can't, especially when the gameplay is literally about walking between.
