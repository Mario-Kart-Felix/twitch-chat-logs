[0:00:49] <%JamesCorck> We doing it!
[0:00:53] <%chill_o_wisp> eyyyyyy
[0:01:07] <%jtdobyns> or does he?
[0:01:09] <%chill_o_wisp> how's everyone doing today
[0:01:15] <ghoostyberry> what about the podcast i didn't see anything on woolies Twitter
[0:01:15] <%JamesCorck> Lets jump onto the feels!
[0:01:16] <AthenaAegis> Space Goblins: The Lunchbox! Space Goblins: The FLAMETHROWER! Kappa
[0:01:16] <yourliteraldog> Pat stops ethnic cleansing
[0:01:27] <%garatrose1> garatrose1 subscribed at Tier 1. They've subscribed for 32 months! I'm here for the CHEAP THRILLS
[0:01:31] <tanarath> @ghoostyberry tuesday
[0:01:36] <%jtdobyns> its tomorrow on woolies twitter
[0:01:39] <knight_verse> Happy space crime day to you guys. Kappa
[0:01:39] <ghoostyberry> ah
[0:01:40] <%xcompleasedad> Serious discussion: is the battle before the climax of this arch the hypest moment in the game, or the second hypest?
[0:01:42] <%4DLuvOfLuthy> im ready for ALL the feelings
[0:01:49] <%JamesCorck> cheer500 Hey Pat, I dunno if this has been done before, but have a shitty joke. Why are you and Gief a pair of Krogan? Because you guys are Two Chonkers.
[0:01:50] <cpt_langosta> two entire chonkers today
[0:02:01] <%GalacticaPhanto> I have to file a complaint for false advertising, this song makes it seem like Pat has massive rhythm
[0:02:04] <+D00msDayDan> it's time to chanka
[0:02:07] <%BaronVonJarvis> BaronVonJarvis subscribed with Prime. They've subscribed for 26 months! 
[0:04:00] <%captain_kirkhammer> You're right, the animator has to go back and take away Pat's rhythm
[0:04:01] <tanarath> @xcompleasedad I'd say it's on par with the next/the one after that. The Krogan deserve redemption, and the combo of Wrex and Eve/Ishtar makes that successful.
[0:04:22] <%Retinolgaming> Time to prevent race wars
[0:04:28] <%AmericanSkidd> "How the Pat saved Krogan Christmas"
[0:04:36] <%jtdobyns> I wonder how many weeks/months this ME stream will be. cause I know at least the citadel dlc is at least 2 streams in themselves

[0:04:48] <%xcompleasedad> @tanarath And then good ol' KL comes to make everything..... less.

[0:06:01] <cpt_langosta> he meant le lol, which is the french version of lol

[0:12:14] <+MeowZerstar> hes gone mad with power
[0:12:15] <+Vigonept> I've always wanted to be reduced to atoms
[0:12:15] <%Agami23> BTTV prevents that
[0:12:15] <%megadblitz> big dicktatot
[0:12:15] <%DangerSloth87> But don't you get N Word Pass+ from hosting a podcast with Woolie?
[0:12:15] <tanarath> @conflagrationsgaming Yes! A person got their channel suspended because a hate raid spammed racial slurs
[0:12:16] <AluxStreams> Killer Queen has already touched this chat.
[0:12:16] <%Retinolgaming> BTTV saved LUL
[0:12:17] <%JamesCorck> Re-spawning in 3, 2, 1...
[0:12:17] <robosqueeb> we sure are pat Kappa
[0:12:18] <%Jeemukun> Pat are those PJs or are you wearing actual pants for once
[0:12:21] <%kingofasgard> does that wipe bit donos or no?
[0:12:24] <%SuckerPunchSyd> How could you kill us
[0:12:24] <$Futurecity10> BTTW > Streamer
[0:12:25] <%mike2hands> Did it worked?
[0:12:26] <+Mrbaconator> two MILLIONS
[0:12:26] <+lord_woodsy> theres 420 viewers rn
[0:12:27] <%AncelDeLambert> all permutations of a word
[0:12:28] <scrumbotime> Chat Rule: Zangief can and will eat all spambots
[0:12:32] <scrumbotime> oh god, the millions of variations
[0:12:34] <cpt_langosta> j****r
[0:12:36] <%YakumoYomi> @TheAntiNihilist It sadly isn't: just bots spamming bad words in chat
[0:12:36] <ConflagrationsGaming> @tanarath yikes. didn't hear about that yet.
[0:12:39] <+Vigonept> jogger?
[0:12:40] <%AncelDeLambert> in just TWO alphabets
[0:12:42] <DianaTheAscian> oh I'm delayed by quite bit
[0:12:45] <%Treasure_Vault> @lord_woodsy praise it
[0:12:45] <%brisk_dacat> why kill us
[0:12:48] <%RealThiele> J-pass
[0:12:49] <%cvp5127> well get on it
[0:12:50] <+Mrbaconator> oh it's TWENTY NINE? I thought it was 2 LUL
[0:12:51] <%kingofasgard> 21.9
[0:12:52] <%shurtal> when I was a child I thought robots were gonna be the coolest.  now that I'm an adult, they're just the lamest possible outcome of the concept of "robot".  this future sucks
[0:12:53] <%BallerSwagBro9k> is jogger a bad word now?
[0:12:53] <%megadblitz> J
[0:12:53] <+ThomasOfTroy> 21.94 MILLION varients is INSANCE
[0:12:54] <%Mr_Pylon> not even all base alphabets too
[0:12:54] <%NopeBadguy> It's about 29 million words using only the latin alphabet. UTF-8 also includes other alphabets like Hebrew. @PatStaresAt
[0:12:54] <@Lion_kun> The safest way is to make follower only mode chat which would suck for new fans.
[0:12:55] <robosqueeb> Jogga is perfectly fine tho
[0:12:55] <cpt_langosta> 2.9
[0:12:55] <SilverFaustX> it would take 76hours to ban chat
[0:12:57] <%KishinGrek> Does it work on the letter emojis?
[0:12:58] <dekkitout> Duh
[0:13:00] <+freelancer_960> 2.9 for latin alone
[0:13:00] <%AmericanSkidd> that is a big number
[0:13:01] <%4DLuvOfLuthy> wow, jesus lol
[0:13:02] <scrumbotime> And that's not even as high as it COULD be
[0:13:10] <TheAntiNihilist> YGR
[0:13:10] <marvel877> So is Pat streaming ME3 today? That's what the stream says.
[0:13:10] <+ThomasOfTroy> 21.94
[0:13:11] <+Mrbaconator> wow my memory AND hearing is bad
[0:13:12] <%xcompleasedad> And Twitch somehow can't do it themselves. Like a bunch of daft fucks.
[0:13:12] <+lord_woodsy> @treasure_vault my man!
[0:13:12] <dekkitout> There's a lot of alphanumerics you can use on the interwebs
[0:13:13] <@ssjklyco> So Dark Souls censorship
[0:13:13] <%AncelDeLambert> @Lion_kun not even follower, subscriber only
[0:13:14] <DianaTheAscian> I'm not even gonna ask what Jogger means now
[0:13:15] <%Monkeyweed21> 2.9 for just latin
[0:13:21] <%SuckerPunchSyd> It would take like 76 days to do it to yeah?
[0:13:21] <%YakumoYomi> @SilverFaustX It was DAYS, not hours
[0:13:22] <+Mrbaconator> but pat woolie gave me a pass
[0:13:22] <%AmericanSkidd> like MOIST
[0:13:23] <%chill_o_wisp> and that's just in Roman alphabet I think, doesn't include Japanese or cyrillic
[0:13:28] <%JamesCorck> Can you make a macro that bans those who use those slurs?
[0:13:29] <$Futurecity10> Twitch staff suck ass
[0:13:29] <SilverFaustX> ahhh
[0:13:29] <scrumbotime> It was enough that to ban them all, it would take a bot running for days and days to SUBMIT each variation to ban it
[0:13:30] <bob900000> anyone got a J pass?
[0:13:30] <+ThomasOfTroy> Bare minimum, they should allow for mass entry I guess, but even that's still bullshit
[0:13:32] <%cvp5127> nah to busy banning the word simp
[0:13:35] <@Lion_kun> I meant subscriber Ancel, my mistake
[0:13:36] <%KishinGrek> Or boat
[0:13:39] <%shadowsofpain> and 76 days to ban them all via bot  for 1 word
[0:13:40] <@OfficioPrefectusCorgi> Moist
[0:13:41] <%sashagreenspiderqueen> @DianaTheAscian joggers has the same number of letters in the same places as a gamer word
[0:13:41] <$Futurecity10> Its a meme
[0:13:42] <ape_hawk> m o i s t
[0:13:42] <%idyota> what is pat actually talking about? really confused RN
[0:13:42] <%chill_o_wisp> sogMoist sogMoist sogMoist sogMoist sogMoist
[0:13:42] <%rekinom> Like Trihex mentioned, requiring 2FA would cut down a lot on the bot raid shit
[0:13:43] <+Vigonept> its sexual
[0:13:43] <%maenos2> It's gross sounding
[0:13:45] <ConflagrationsGaming> its uncomfy for some people
[0:13:45] <%snow_bush> Nyanners has grown too strong
[0:13:46] <AMDBR9S> moist is a good word
[0:13:47] <%Treasure_Vault> Is it a Psych thing?
[0:13:48] <kingra> Wet and MOIST
[0:13:48] <+Rolandknight> no idea as well
[0:13:49] <@goose_attack_almanac> What you want a dry pudding
[0:13:49] <%shurtal> it's like turgid
[0:13:49] <SiameseSneeze> this pleases the moist moist
[0:13:49] <stormhawk9891> Me neither
[0:13:50] <scrumbotime> It gives like, the impression of, Armpits, and Swamps
[0:13:50] <JustYudha> Trendy
[0:13:51] <%SaiyanShoto> I have no clue, my sister gets so grossed out when someone says it
[0:13:53] <%AncelDeLambert> You're French, you don't count
[0:13:53] <dekkitout> No clue
[0:13:53] <ExpressNode> Wooo I finally landed a 3070. Also I haven't seen a stream in a minute because of a business trip. What I missed?
[0:13:53] <%GalacticaPhanto> it's the way you say it so it hits a center in my brain which bothers me
[0:13:54] <Latija> cake is moist
[0:13:54] <%AmericanSkidd> I dont know, i'm not one of them
[0:13:54] <%Jeemukun> honestly same
[0:13:55] <DracaenaLeaf> People hate moist because others hate moist. Those people are cowards!
[0:13:55] <DianaTheAscian> @sashagreenspiderqueen ah okay
[0:13:56] <+SataruYamate> how can you have a problem with moist when MoistCritikal exists
[0:13:56] <%BallerSwagBro9k> moist lombussy?
[0:13:57] <+MightyDuckShoes> when I think of moist, I think of rumcake
[0:13:57] <+ThomasOfTroy> I'm american, and I've only heard people objecting to moist as a joke
[0:13:57] <jcflyguy> Ointment
[0:13:57] <%valriot> Its more gross in the UK, moist vag n all that
[0:13:58] <%xcompleasedad> They're being fucking dumb
[0:13:59] <%SuckerPunchSyd> It sounds gross
[0:13:59] <+rafaelba93> oi sounds like what it is, its great
[0:14:00] <dekkitout> Maybe it's a mouth sound
[0:14:01] <%RealThiele> that old woman jpeg?
[0:14:02] <robosqueeb> Saying you dislike moist makes you look quirky and like, so interesting
[0:14:02] <%YakumoYomi> M O I S T
[0:14:03] <TheAntiNihilist> I LOVE moist.
[0:14:06] <%Jeemukun> I only ever heard moist in a postive context
[0:14:06] <scrumbotime> Armpits and Swamps
[0:14:07] <%NopeBadguy> Moist
[0:14:09] <dekkitout> Moist soil sounds nice
[0:14:09] <Aiutare47> It’s like the original meme
[0:14:09] <%Torus1025> Americans have never made a woman wet
[0:14:10] <DianaTheAscian> @PatStaresAt they're cowards
[0:14:11] <%mike2hands> Is just a word
[0:14:11] <%NopeBadguy> because wet shloppy dong
[0:14:11] <%AmericanSkidd> people are weird
[0:14:12] <cpt_langosta> moist means something different now, as does cake
[0:14:13] <bob900000> moist critical
[0:14:13] <+ThomasOfTroy> Am I moist?
[0:14:14] <%KishinGrek> Words that end with a hard T are uncomfortable
[0:14:16] <%Monkeyweed21> do you want soggy cake?
[0:14:18] <%mike2hands> But i love it
[0:14:18] <TheAntiNihilist> moist
[0:14:18] <nyacoo> For the same reason people hate pineapple on pizza
[0:14:19] <%UvBenServed> Moist cake Kreygasm Kreygasm Kreygasm
[0:14:19] <%maenos2> imagine Gilbert Gottfried saying moist
[0:14:20] <tanarath> It'd take non-verified streamers having their channel bot spamming 24/7 for 76 days to eliminate 'jogger'
[0:14:20] <%shadowsofpain> gross connotations
[0:14:21] <%NopeBadguy> A SURPRISE?
[0:14:22] <%bravebravesrobin> "Curt Schilling's Former Employees Are Now Getting 14-20% Of Their Final Paychecks From 2012" what an asshole Cheer500
[0:14:22] <%sashagreenspiderqueen> @PatStaresAt theres a tool that hasanabi tweeted about recently that kills raids that might be worth looking into
[0:14:23] <a_bad_proof_of_concept> maybe it's when it's in a certain accent maybe?
[0:14:23] <+lord_woodsy> moist is a beautiful word
[0:14:24] <%megadblitz> @ballerswagbro9k why would you say that
[0:14:29] <%MidnightBurst12> because they hear other people don't like the word

[0:21:17] <@Spydurman> @ThomasOfTroy test done, how's it look?
[0:21:17] <%chill_o_wisp> yeah it's rough
[0:21:20] <marvel877> ???
[0:21:22] <%Garthunox> why not just watch release order?
[0:21:24] <ape_hawk> CONGRATULATIONS
[0:21:24] <%chill_o_wisp> JP is the only way
[0:21:28] <%jackelzxaa> i don't like the new one but i think the old dub is pretty based
[0:21:29] <DatAsuna> Tachanka time, LMG mounted and ready!
[0:21:30] <+SinnerEbru> the one good EVA dub is shinji's VA outtake
[0:21:30] <artoflec> dubs in general 🚮
[0:21:31] <%mads_valentine> Woo!
[0:21:31] <TheAntiNihilist> IT WAS REALLY GREAT
[0:21:31] <Aiutare47> The Netflix one was ok
[0:21:31] <marvel877> WHICH dub?
[0:21:32] <%Treasure_Vault> The french canadian dub?
[0:21:34] <%Monkeyweed21> ITS AN ANGEL
[0:21:34] <%MidnightBurst12> agreed
[0:21:34] <DianaTheAscian> okay but y?
[0:21:35] <BigFingerRo> FUN FACTOID: In the spanish dub, Asuka has the THICKEST fake accent
[0:21:37] <%KishinGrek> The new netflix one is atrocious
[0:21:37] <%BallerSwagBro9k> What about the Abriged Ones? Kappa
[0:21:37] <$KnivesEve> even the spainish one!?
[0:21:38] <%maenos2> what is sephirotic
[0:21:38] <yourliteraldog> shinji sounds weird
[0:21:39] <ryderbootz> oh boy do i disagree
[0:21:43] <jorniev> was 12 minutes good?
[0:21:46] <%derpy_platypus> it's an anguru
[0:21:46] <+SaphronBlackbourne> Imagine watching dubs
[0:21:47] <+QuasartheHero> Thats fair i guess
[0:21:48] <$Futurecity10> they suck
[0:21:50] <%YakumoYomi> I've only watched the dub of the original series. Is that why I dislike Evangelion?
[0:21:54] <%Bailey__gaming> @peachsaliva we know we can see the stink lines
[0:21:56] <kingra> Shinji sounds like a pussy as he should
[0:21:56] <%KeiganOfAstora> Why you hate dub
[0:21:56] <+megaman_sentinel> your not alone
[0:21:57] <%peyodogo> @BigFingerRo this is true
[0:21:57] <cpt_langosta> no idea how any version sounds, only ever read the manga
[0:21:58] <%Wallabri> you can (not) redub
[0:22:05] <Tracazoid> I think Asuka's bathroom freak-out is great in the old dub but that's because Asuka's the best actress of the dub. Shinji's scream in End of Eva in Japanese is the best anime scream though.
[0:22:06] <$Futurecity10> @PatStaresAt What? You dont like Asuka and Shinji talking about Safe sex with AIDS?
[0:22:08] <%Treasure_Vault> is there a french canadian dub?
[0:22:09] <+AmuserName> yukiko's VA for rei though!
[0:22:11] <%jtdobyns> has Paige watched beastars season 2 yet and how did she like it?
[0:22:13] <ape_hawk> pat, you looking forward to Netflix Cowboy Bebop???
[0:22:13] <%NopeBadguy> NO HATE BUT I HATE HIM
[0:22:13] <%jackelzxaa> >imagine not hating shinji
[0:22:14] <theloganbrand> Spike Spencer sells dating guides
[0:22:20] <+skyheys> Its okay to hate Sonny Strait
[0:22:21] <%derpy_platypus> Shinji should be dubbed by Micheal Cera
[0:22:21] <%MidnightBurst12> As a person?
[0:22:24] <%MidnightBurst12> oh
[0:22:25] <+Schrodingers_Box> Hate the Actor, hes a dick IRL to con staff
[0:22:26] <%KeiganOfAstora> Fair enough, you're a purist about the VA cast
[0:22:26] <DatAsuna> "No hate on the actor, but I hate the actor"
[0:22:26] <%NopeBadguy> Thanking peepo
[0:22:29] <AluxStreams> Mass Effect?
[0:22:30] <%Romuken> @PatStaresAt Is that la bomba shirt a streaming shirt?  not bitching, love that show, just curious.  And where you got it.

[0:22:38] <%lord_woodsy> thanking peeps
[0:22:39] <%SaiyanShoto> That's funny cause I don't like the voice of japanese dub shinji
[0:22:40] <%Romuken> nailed it
[0:22:43] <PaperyHornet1013> you can (not) give a good performance
[0:22:45] <%KeiganOfAstora> Shitting on Paige
[0:22:47] <marvel877> yelling at Paige?
[0:22:47] <%dawarw0lf> Reading
[0:22:48] <yourliteraldog> Micheal Cera is a good pick
[0:22:48] <%jackelzxaa> what if quentin flynn dubbed shinji
[0:22:50] <blackjack8182> I love Spike Spencer’s voice as Shinji!
[0:22:59] <%Daxalog> I got the swab just to see...Oh god thats not a good time. Ow.
[0:22:59] <%KeiganOfAstora> Vidja gayme?

[0:23:19] <@Moobot> I don't know if I can trust that. (@Ravioli_Ronin) (warning)
[0:23:22] <cpt_langosta> yikes
[0:23:25] <%hewlettfan96> Hey how are you feeling about Afghanistan
[0:23:26] <jorniev> fuck dem banks
[0:23:27] <%4DLuvOfLuthy> Oof
[0:23:29] <%RealThiele> Onlyfans got lazy with standards
[0:23:31] <%shadowsofpain> I really like the Netflix Shinji actor they are a nice person
[0:23:34] <+Vigonept> since back then?
[0:23:35] <jorniev> oh wow
[0:23:39] <%Ravioli_Ronin> OnlyBanks
[0:23:45] <%KishinGrek> What is with people hating on the oldest profession in existence
[0:23:50] <yourliteraldog> Its child sex abuse materials fam
[0:23:51] <%maenos2> there is some puritanical group backing things though I read
[0:23:51] <+Schrodingers_Box> Didnt Pornhub go through something similiar?
[0:23:54] <+ThomasOfTroy> @Spydurman It's less intrusive than I thought it'd be. I expected to be kicked out for the 10 seconds and to see a notification, but it just made a beep sound and replaced the chat box with a 10 second timer and a message saying I wasn't allowed to chat
[0:23:54] <%kingofasgard> so it's paige's fault got it
[0:23:57] <%captain_kirkhammer> ONE GUY
[0:24:05] <%Ravioli_Ronin> @kishingrek regressivism
[0:24:05] <%AmericanSkidd> shocker
[0:24:13] <jorniev> so it's entirely the pages fault
[0:24:13] <tanarath> The people pushing it behind the scenes ARE piluritans, though.
[0:24:21] <%RealThiele> monee go up, standards go down
[0:24:25] <olm46> If they don't care about the kids, they won't care about the platform
[0:24:27] <%BallerSwagBro9k> Just punch the government Kappa
[0:24:31] <scrumbotime> I mean, there's also an incredibly massive puritanical MoneyBeast that is actively campaigning against this shit and is taking credit for this
[0:24:32] <Profmcstevie> Hey stop that "no" well you forced my hand
[0:24:39] <%jackelzxaa> pat did you see any of the new spiderman things?
[0:24:40] <%BallerSwagBro9k> HOW COULD THIS BE?
[0:24:43] <%kingofasgard> how can this beeeee
[0:24:43] <BigFingerRo> BUH WHA HAPPEN
[0:24:43] <Latija> how could this happun
[0:24:47] <%Torus1025> Then they pay a fine and nothing happens lmao
[0:24:50] <ape_hawk> Its also because Mastercard is ending connections with companies that sell or promote porn because of massive amounts of chargeback shit
[0:24:50] <DianaTheAscian> wait are loot boxes dead?
[0:24:51] <tanarath> They're constantly pushing to criminalize sex work
[0:24:52] <cpt_langosta> what's a loot box, is that like a surprise mechanic?
[0:24:53] <@Spydurman> @Spydurman yeah it's a pretty chill way to just be like "Hey plz stop". Good way to handle someone being annoying but not terrible
[0:24:54] <Mattais88> Just gt here, FIFA?
[0:24:55] <%SovPho> it's mastercard and visa
[0:24:55] <%brisk_dacat> i miss backpage

[0:25:01] <%Ravioli_Ronin> “WhY dOnT yOu gEt a ReAl jOb” has0head dnm25iq
[0:25:06] <%KishinGrek> The consequences of my own actions? Oh no
[0:25:07] <TheAntiNihilist> but what about actual porn sites?
[0:25:07] <%RealThiele> i mean wells fargo funded the cartels and got away with it
[0:25:07] <%cvp5127> BUT NO TIDDIES
[0:25:09] <$lumporr> "we wanta da mooonneeeyyy"

[0:25:49] <scrumbotime> Puritans.
[0:25:50] <%Treasure_Vault> It's kinda fucked that men can walk around shirtless while women can't
[0:25:50] <+SinnerEbru> soemthing something sexism, i think
[0:25:52] <kingra> The only thing the porn sites did wrong was not getting rid of the illegal shit
[0:25:52] <%captain_kirkhammer> Read "Seed of Albion"
[0:25:52] <%AmericanSkidd> I LOVE BOOBIES
[0:25:53] <%Ravioli_Ronin> The Klan is fine, but BOOBA???? Unacceptable
[0:25:53] <$lumporr> founded by puritans
[0:25:54] <+Vigonept> its like Australia all over again

[0:25:59] <Apolar_> Boobs are a moral hazard, clearly
[0:26:00] <legion0047> BUT THINK ABOUT THE CHILDREN
[0:26:00] <%jackelzxaa> Americans try to pretend they DONT like boobies because they're embarassed
[0:26:00] <robosqueeb> but everyone i don't like is a nazi!
[0:26:01] <%SlyDC> its so stupid
[0:26:03] <SilverFaustX> but nazi's have gold in switserland
[0:26:04] <%hewlettfan96> Those nazis ain’t flashing tidddies
[0:26:05] <intestinal_bleeding> @PatStaresAt in america it's about controlling women mostly
[0:26:06] <scrumbotime> SUPER Anti-Fun Christians

[0:26:28] <%JoshManVGH> Booba is good but only when with Jesus?
[0:26:28] <intestinal_bleeding> nazis are also like "boobs are degenerate and therefore this"
[0:26:28] <%SuckerPunchSyd> Puritans hate public boobies
[0:26:29] <%Romuken> how odd to hear mastercard basically say "boobs are more racist than racists."
[0:26:29] <stantheman_97> we were founded by puritans and that culture has stuck around over the centuries
[0:26:31] <%Larry_Q> america is run by dinosaurs
[0:26:34] <%MelBrooksKA> some Americans hate the idea of tits and are really loud @patstaresat

[0:27:03] <+Soliloquy123> Eh, there's nothing new under the sun. Somebody made that joke before you did
[0:27:03] <%RealThiele> HE PASSED!
[0:27:05] <%hewlettfan96> Terrible
[0:27:05] <rearedlogarithm> Man I came in at a good time.
[0:27:06] <jorniev> TOO CHONKA
[0:27:08] <%miguelrod777> that's a fail
[0:27:12] <+ThomasOfTroy> @Spydurman Yeah, I agree. As a user, even a short time out like this tells me I need to chill or that one of my messages went too far. Enjoy the mod powers!
[0:27:12] <%4DLuvOfLuthy> a pass is a pass lol
[0:27:19] <%machshop> ???
[0:27:20] <%hewlettfan96> CHONKA
[0:27:22] <KosOrSomeSayKosm_> which probably won't work
[0:27:23] <bob900000> his was better
[0:27:24] <%Romuken> To protest hate raids?
[0:27:25] <%derpy_platypus> And then nothing will change
[0:27:26] <+unhuggable1> wonder how many people are gonna do
[0:27:26] <%jackelzxaa> Pat do you prefer tifa with short hair or long hair?
[0:27:26] <%jtdobyns> what's september 1st?

[0:27:27] <%bravebravesrobin> If you don't support the boobs, the terrorists win... Cheer500
[0:27:28] <yourliteraldog> Quote on Quote Christians , I contend that protestants are all heretics and anti intellectuals.
[0:27:30] <%baka_sugoi> kinda
[0:27:30] <%athuramn> half way there
[0:27:31] <%AmericanSkidd> that said, i would never pay for stuff like onlyfans cuz i get my free porn elsewhere
[0:27:32] <%captain_kirkhammer> Problem with this kind of strike is you can't assault the scabs
[0:27:32] <%cvp5127> day off
[0:27:32] <dekkitout> Whom's walking out?
[0:27:36] <stantheman_97> a strike is pointless if it's only a day
[0:27:40] <%KishinGrek> Im in
[0:27:41] <Profmcstevie> Twitch don't pay attention to that shit
[0:27:41] <count1999> it was the hate raids?
[0:27:44] <%Treasure_Vault> If this is a thing, sure
[0:27:48] <TioXyco> it's a protest on hate raid... which will work for nothing, tobe fair
[0:27:49] <%kingofasgard> a day is kinda nothing though is the problem
[0:27:49] <+Cactuskris> best time for small streamers to stream than
[0:27:52] <+unhuggable1> one day isnt an unsub
[0:27:58] <%GarbageNirvana> And that's going to amount to...what, exactly
[0:27:59] <%deviljhojho_> i do love complaining
[0:28:01] <%Retinolgaming> This never works, I remember last time they did this, the streamers who don't take the day off get big number.
[0:28:01] <+rafaelba93> do both
[0:28:04] <%Treasure_Vault> hey pat can you unionize all the streamers
[0:28:06] <%Zalapski> it's not effective, i agree -- speak up and speak out, use your platform
[0:28:07] <rearedlogarithm> I just noticed that the next part of the series Man of Medan was in came out last October. Any plans to play it?
[0:28:09] <tanarath> Complain a lot constantly
[0:28:10] <%cobalt_phoenix_> can streamers unionize? or something to that effect?
[0:28:11] <%cvp5127> use adblock
[0:28:11] <Profmcstevie> Complain and make them look bad, make the ads sweat
[0:28:12] <Storm_Samurai> pats good at that
[0:28:12] <%Daxalog> make the complaints into a meme will do more damage
[0:28:13] <RealThiele> fill their inboxes
[0:28:13] <%Romuken> Complain that you're being bullied by boobs since apparently that's how you get shit to be stopped @PatStaresAt
[0:28:15] <$StrawberryPantsu> Hey I made it for the best part of the stream
[0:28:15] <%AmericanSkidd> but let people pay for tits and ass if they want to and its between consenting adults
[0:28:16] <Mattais88> Are we going to mount splashmore x 100000
[0:28:17] <%JoshManVGH> September 1st, Internal Twitch Bitch Day!
[0:28:17] <dekkitout> Can't really dent a well established site...
[0:28:18] <jbrachob> but that takes effort
[0:28:22] <heartlesshealer> The squeaky wheel gets the grease
[0:28:24] <%RealThiele> also blasting twitch on all social media would be a better use of time
[0:28:30] <notsoy> and make sure your viewers create dozens of clips outlining the complaints
[0:28:30] <%Bailey__gaming> Twitch needs 2fa sooner rather than later
[0:28:33] <Profmcstevie> SPEND THE WHOLE DAY COMPLAINING ACROSS THE PLATFORM
[0:28:34] <TioXyco> complain about it everyday
[0:28:38] <intestinal_bleeding> you could even bring attention to it and promote things like trans rights charities or whatever
[0:28:40] <dekkitout> @RealThiele 💯
[0:28:41] <%Ravioli_Ronin> psaBig Complain
[0:28:42] <%dawarw0lf> Modern warfare boycott anyone?
[0:28:45] <scrumbotime> Well, that works until they spam something and then report you for what they spammed and get your channel just shut down
[0:28:46] <Madinki> Literally pointless
[0:28:46] <yourliteraldog> Yeah that kind of strike isn't very effective.
[0:28:49] <stantheman_97> wait a new aliens game?
[0:28:51] <%BallerSwagBro9k> Its surprisingly decent
[0:28:51] <%Ravioli_Ronin> Oh does that have matchmaking?
[0:28:57] <%AmericanSkidd> where's pucci?
[0:28:58] <%YakumoYomi> Wait...Fireteam came out already?
[0:29:04] <%Ravioli_Ronin> The reviews are good
[0:29:06] <scrumbotime> YEAH
[0:29:06] <%Romuken> YAY
[0:29:08] <RenniGlo> Have been blasting twitch on social media and complaining everyday for the hate raids. It's just not getting the results we want so a strike day is basically us trying anything and everything

[0:29:40] <TioXyco> What about FF6?
[0:29:41] <%KishinGrek> 3 is awesome
[0:29:45] <+megaman_sentinel> 2 is the worst
[0:29:46] <%kingofasgard> 2 is fine, shame about that levelling
[0:29:46] <$StrawberryPantsu> You don't like 4?
[0:29:48] <BigFingerRo> I SLEPP
[0:29:48] <%BallerSwagBro9k> But Cloud of Darkness mommy
[0:29:52] <%JoshManVGH> It has vancian casting. And it's weird
[0:29:52] <artoflec> FF4 is awesome
[0:29:52] <dekkitout> Good use of the meme
[0:29:53] <%KishinGrek> 6 is best
[0:29:53] <%SaiyanShoto> agreed
[0:29:53] <%shadowsofpain> 4 is nice
[0:29:54] <%GarbageNirvana> Isn't 3 where the Crystal Tower came from
[0:29:55] <yourliteraldog> Sterilization reverse
[0:29:56] <DianaTheAscian> @PatStaresAt really not 4?
[0:29:56] <%BallerSwagBro9k> BUT 4 THO
[0:29:57] <TheAntiNihilist> 4 tho...
[0:29:58] <SaltyAzteca> 2 has good world music, its poignant
[0:29:58] <%hewlettfan96> 6 Is incredible
[0:30:02] <Tracazoid> I'm more interested in the 3 pixel remaster because I don't find the DS style appealing
[0:30:04] <%SaiyanShoto> 4 is meh
[0:30:04] <Latija> Paige is the 4 simp
[0:30:05] <@PeachSaliva> i will fight u
[0:30:07] <@ssjklyco> Just put them on switch
[0:30:13] <jcflyguy> You spoony bard
[0:30:16] <artoflec> 3 introduced a lot of cool stuff but it was also the first FF game to have like, character scripting and sprites moving around.
[0:30:18] <%JoshManVGH> Job System is incredible!
[0:30:19] <%RealThiele> FF3 is a mess of a game but its got a lot of good lore
[0:30:19] <theanora1> that Kefka fight in FF14 is amazing
[0:30:23] <TheAntiNihilist> 5 IS under rated
[0:30:24] <dekkitout> Quien?
[0:30:25] <+megaman_sentinel> two has a bad leveling system
[0:30:27] <%shadowsofpain> Apperently the pixel remaster of 3 might be the best version of that game
[0:30:28] <ghoostyberry> pat fuck you
[0:30:28] <+Mrbaconator> i don't know who that is

[0:32:36] <jorniev> Fuck that guy
[0:32:37] <%Romuken> Wait, that guy had the power to make them have double mortgages without them knowing?  I guess he did have their socials and money info...
[0:32:40] <stantheman_97> that sounds like it should be a crime
[0:32:43] <%RealThiele> and curt whines on rightwing media now too
[0:32:44] <%captainpodock> he still owes Rhode Island  BTW
[0:32:47] <count1999> and who was this?
[0:32:50] <$StrawberryPantsu> Or a Condo
[0:32:50] <%jackelzxaa> i remember curt shilling was on giant bomb and was all "yeah this is gonna be great"
[0:32:51] <$StrawberryPantsu> :^)
[0:32:52] <%SuckerPunchSyd> Oh man i would kill that guy
[0:32:53] <%JoshManVGH> It's weirdly like that sort of shit should come with jail time.
[0:32:55] <alrobot2014> Connecticut woot
[0:32:56] <heartlesshealer> it IS a crime
[0:32:58] <%Retinolgaming> @Zebroneath Rhode island? Do you mean East Connecticut? psaSmug
[0:33:06] <@ssjklyco> So kind of like boss key games but they found out through twitter
[0:33:11] <DianaTheAscian> oh this shit yeah

[0:33:27] <+musmayrelchup> why not just sell the old house...?
[0:33:29] <+Cactuskris> why would you do that
[0:33:30] <%cobalt_phoenix_> that sounds off...
[0:33:31] <%Ravioli_Ronin> It’s a stack multiplier for your house
[0:33:34] <%AmericanSkidd> this sounds like a scam
[0:33:36] <BigFingerRo> YEAH, SURE, PAY 2 MORTGAGES FOR NOTHIN
[0:33:37] <%KishinGrek> Thats fucked
[0:33:38] <%Bailey__gaming> So What happened today? some people got  a v small amount?
[0:33:39] <DianaTheAscian> didn't that happen at telltale as well?
[0:33:39] <Mattais88> But why not just sell the old house?
[0:33:39] <ExpressNode> That sounds like a way to get into eternal debt
[0:33:39] <%JoshManVGH> And you loose BOTH houses.
[0:33:43] <%KetsuoTaberu> sounds like a true death pledge
[0:33:43] <JetpackMcQuack> das crazy
[0:33:43] <%Ravioli_Ronin> Quad mortgage let’s go bois
[0:33:44] <bob900000> ......

[0:33:46] <+unhuggable1> its hard to just sell a house instantly
[0:33:46] <%GarbageNirvana> Capitalism was a mistake
[0:33:47] <%athuramn> it's basically debt indenture forever
[0:33:54] <dekkitout> Ah.
[0:34:06] <count1999> what game company was this?

[0:34:17] <TheAntiNihilist> The moral is NEVER move to Rhode Island
[0:34:17] <+vaderxyz1970> Was he a coward to his employees or just an asshole
[0:34:17] <%hewlettfan96> Capitalist trite
[0:34:19] <legion0047> We had an oopsie uwu

[0:34:26] <%Shubreaker> 38 studios
[0:34:26] <heartlesshealer> individual who created company
[0:34:28] <+musmayrelchup> what a complicated shit show, better to just sell the old house on the market and rent at the new place

[0:44:52] <cpt_langosta> turns into skeleharem party
[0:44:54] <dekkitout> She'd make a great necro-bro
[0:44:56] <%megadblitz> just make her a full skeleton woman
[0:44:57] <%Romuken> u wont
[0:44:58] <Latija> Necro something
[0:44:58] <%hewlettfan96> LUL LUL LUL
[0:44:59] <%shadowsofpain> Corgo500 Honestly the best and worst part was them loving Ramiel so much and then feeling 3 levels of depressed by Asuka's end of show arc. Apperently it hit too close to home for her, oops lol. Sadly by then she was way too in to stop
[0:44:59] <%rekinom> "I just want to animate a skeleton to fight people haha not for any sex reasons haha"
[0:45:00] <%kingofasgard> necros aren't great
[0:45:00] <+D00msDayDan> it's time to chanka
[0:45:03] <%Ravioli_Ronin> hasKapp SKELE
[0:45:03] <Profmcstevie> "I roll for initiative to kiss my skeletons"
[0:45:04] <%twistedj3ster> that would be a wise decision
[0:45:05] <%FaderPotater> necromancer or Necro romancer?
[0:45:06] <%Romuken> no ovaries, you wont
[0:45:09] <@OfficioPrefectusCorgi> She that skalaton be discarde in detail
[0:45:09] <%AmericanSkidd> Time to be a cool guy
[0:45:12] <%Rumbutt> Make a zombie Paige! Please! NO! ONLY SKELETON!!!
[0:45:12] <yourliteraldog> necro para
[0:45:14] <heartlesshealer> Just have her be a summoner whose eidolon or whatever is a skeleton that fights for her
[0:45:14] <SnorlaxBud> a bag of holding can fit ALOT of skeletons
[0:45:15] <%Treasure_Vault> I thought DND was about minmaxing your fetish playstyle
[0:45:22] <%Reaviar> just be a death cleric, all the benefits of being the cleric and a creepy death person
[0:45:24] <%toolofparanoia> yeah its mass effect night. I'M HOME JUST IN TIME FOR PAT TO SMOOCH GARRUS
[0:45:34] <dekkitout> Deng
[0:45:38] <Tracazoid> Eva does that
[0:45:40] <%DianaTheAscian> oof
[0:45:53] <%baka_sugoi> dang
[0:45:53] <cpt_langosta> start with magma diver
[0:45:58] <alrobot2014> the end of asuka's arc still fucks me up
[0:46:06] <%shadowsofpain> sorry for the confusion lol
[0:46:06] <%Ravioli_Ronin> time to give the turtles their boners back psaUp
[0:46:10] <dekkitout> But thermal expansion tho
[0:46:10] <+ThomasOfTroy> INFLATION
[0:46:11] <%Romuken> see he aint doing it, no ovaries
[0:46:12] <%maenos2> but inflation
[0:46:14] <%deviljhojho_> what even happened in magma diver i forgot
[0:46:15] <%Rumbutt> Only because you don't have an inflation kink Pat
[0:46:17] <+AmuserName> but inflation fetish tho???
[0:46:18] <%Ghufufin> THERMAL EXPANSION!
[0:46:18] <Psyramics> a lot of them can be removed
[0:46:19] <%RetroCop87> the magma diver suit is in FF7
[0:46:19] <+skyheys> BUT THE FAT SUIT
[0:46:19] <alrobot2014> is it because of inflation
[0:46:20] <%strakillias> Cause its literally the worst episode
[0:46:25] <+D00msDayDan> but pat, the inflation kink
[0:46:26] <%hrbeck_> it's so bad
[0:46:26] <+GuilKato> Thermal Expansion!
[0:46:28] <yourliteraldog> they kill a baby angel
[0:46:29] <$Futurecity10> Nope, because adam shows up
[0:46:29] <stantheman_97> but the inflation scene
[0:46:29] <%KeiganOfAstora> Which one is that?
[0:46:30] <%DrTomT18> Pat, you should listen to the Bobiverse books!
[0:46:31] <%Ravioli_Ronin> I forget about magma diver until someone brings it up
[0:46:32] <legion0047> the writers badly hidden fetish
[0:46:34] <%LumberjackJack> Funnily enough: I still enjoy it, though I will agree it's the least-important episode
[0:46:36] <%megadblitz> Eva has episode names? I just thought it was ep 1 ep 2
[0:46:39] <%maenos2> how can it be bad if jet alone exists
[0:46:39] <%baka_sugoi> NO
[0:46:40] <ExpressNode> Button hit good
[0:46:41] <legion0047> it adds literaly nothing
[0:46:41] <%baka_sugoi> ah
[0:46:43] <%AmericanSkidd> yay
[0:46:44] <%Treasure_Vault> i only watched the anime once, so my opinions are half-baked but i think it was about fighting aliens
[0:46:48] <%hewlettfan96> It is the one that’s objectively bad
[0:46:48] <%shadowsofpain> honestly the fake American eva can also be removed with zero reprocasions
[0:46:50] <%DianaTheAscian> the ep that awakened a bunch of folks
[0:46:51] <%Monkeyweed21> nothing happens at all there is no development of plot or character
[0:46:52] <+vaderxyz1970> Maybe tell paige its safe now?
[0:46:54] <Latija> which one was magma diver?
[0:46:55] <%LumberjackJack> But what about No-Signal?!
[0:46:56] <%Ravioli_Ronin> Twochonkers, Illinois
[0:46:57] <%maenos2> IT ADDS NOTHING
[0:46:59] <+Peacefrog7> tuchanka today @PatStaresAt
[0:47:01] <+Peacefrog7> ?
[0:47:03] <%DrTomT18> I started replaying this game cause of you pat
[0:47:04] <%DrTomT18> fuckyou
[0:47:05] <Mattais88> Jet Alone is fun industrial Sabotage
[0:47:05] <%xcompleasedad> Which episode???
[0:47:07] <illtima> JET ALONE IS INCREDIBLE WHAT THE FUCK
[0:47:07] <TheLocalRival> Hey Pat, can you say something mean to me. It would make my day.
[0:47:09] <%Ravioli_Ronin> Jet alone is pog
[0:47:10] <%RetroCop87> what was the mech that OC Mana piloted?
[0:47:10] <dekkitout> Jet Alone's two things. One a cool name, two a decent episode
[0:47:12] <%Romuken> oh shit he did it, he called my bluff,
[0:47:16] <%Rumbutt> @Latija Asuka inflation suit
[0:47:16] <AluxStreams> Jet Alone adds depth to the world.
[0:47:19] <%hrbeck_> it can be cool and the episode suck around it
[0:47:19] <%Romuken> he's got all the ovaries
[0:47:21] <+skyheys> It adds Jet Alone
[0:47:22] <Aiutare47> It adds Jet Alone
[0:47:22] <Psyramics> @Latija the one where they have to dive into a volcano
[0:47:22] <%Wurmspawn> Made it JUST in time! (though I'll probably go back and watch the pre-game banter later on)
[0:47:27] <delerim001> JET ALONE RULES!!
[0:47:28] <%maenos2> at least there's an angel in magma  diver
[0:47:31] <+AmuserName> Jet alone has MISATO FOCUS. Good episode
[0:47:32] <alrobot2014> jet alone isn't inflation, so it autowins
[0:47:33] <%DianaTheAscian> Jet alone looks dumb I like it
[0:47:37] <%hewlettfan96> Evangelion is just a shitty version of dancing in the franx
[0:47:37] <+GuilKato> Jet Alone showed you what Nerv would do to keep controll
[0:47:38] <%maenos2> ok fair
[0:47:43] <Latija> I literally don't remember that episode
[0:47:45] <%DrTomT18> I require The Boy. Bring him forth for me.
[0:47:46] <%maenos2> I'll grant the misato stuff works
[0:47:53] <yourliteraldog> It's not even alive yet if I recall
[0:47:57] <%castlerock42> No sound BTW.
[0:47:59] <Aiutare47> It adds a bit of lore though
[0:48:00] <stantheman_97> ramiel is the best angel
[0:48:00] <yourliteraldog> They do an abortion
[0:48:03] <TioXyco> Magma Diver was an ok episode to me
[0:48:05] <RiderSensei> n osound

[0:50:42] <Blackleafx> You saw Sovereign blow up
[0:50:43] <TioXyco> all those plans are basically suicide missions on a smaller scale
[0:50:43] <%Ravioli_Ronin> Throw an asteroid at the reapers
[0:50:45] <dekkitout> They're made of adamantine and mythril
[0:50:46] <%Eaglestrike117> Thats cause they are Pat
[0:50:46] <%DrTomT18> Because they are

[0:50:52] <%kingofasgard> they aren't, but i get you
[0:50:54] <%strakillias> That's why he said draw it away and not kill it
[0:50:54] <+ReallyBigRocks> what about a bigger gun tho?
[0:50:55] <legion0047> they have a damage treshhold
[0:50:55] <Apolar_> Yeah. What are all those ships doing when they can't even damage a reaper?
[0:50:56] <majindusto> lol
[0:50:58] <Virokwet> remember me1?
[0:50:58] <Profmcstevie> Armour does not respond to our anything
[0:50:58] <%DrTomT18> It took the ENTIRE fleet to take one down and they barely survived
[0:50:59] <%LumberjackJack> "Just get a bigger gun" 4Head

[0:51:07] <+NicheNova> Its like the series wasn't built for this kind of story
[0:51:08] <%Eaglestrike117> It took an entire fleet to kill soveriegn remember?
[0:51:09] <legion0047> anything beloe the damage gets actually ignored
[0:51:09] <%deviljhojho_> time to get genophucked
[0:51:09] <SaltyAzteca> AH THIS PART
[0:51:10] <cpt_langosta> TIME TO BULLY SALARIANS AGAIN

[0:51:51] <%SpcOpsBear> Salari-Karen go fuck yourself
[0:51:51] <TheAntiNihilist> Who cares
[0:51:51] <tanarath> Yes?
[0:51:51] <+Vigonept> 50/50
[0:51:54] <QuestlordJake> with fuckin WREX yes
[0:51:56] <$KnivesEve> NOT THE TIME YOU FROG
[0:51:58] <@Spydurman> the Krogan have done less damage to the galaxy then fucking Salarians
[0:51:59] <+AmuserName> FWIW Pat, some of the CODEX entries on the REAPER WAR flesh out the logistics of how things are going, what places are getting fucked up, how armies are fighting them, etc.
[0:52:01] <Profmcstevie> Not my decision
[0:52:02] <%deviljhojho_> shoulda thought about that
[0:52:06] <%DrTomT18> ya see, the answer is only yes if Wrex is alive
[0:52:07] <Blackleafx> krogans can have a little breeding, as a treat
[0:52:09] <yourliteraldog> FUCK YOU STINKY FROG
[0:52:12] <Blackleafx> GOD. MORE WAR CRIMES. YAAAAY
[0:52:13] <%DrTomT18> if Wreave is in charge then FUCK NO
[0:52:14] <intestinal_bleeding> i really like the arrogant assumption that they'll just straight up survive the reapera ttack
[0:52:15] <$KaosMachina> "HOW DARE YOU UNDO THE GENOCIDE I WORKED SO HARD TO ACHIEVE"
[0:52:16] <GustauveVIII> BITCH I SAW YAHG IN YOUR GODDAMN RESEARCH FACILITY
[0:52:17] <%cooldude69xx> The worst part is she might have a point
[0:52:18] <%machshop> oh fuck off
[0:52:19] <+vaderxyz1970> Why not try to out breed them then?
[0:52:22] <tanarath> AND NOW YOU'RE UPLIFTING THE YOG YOU BITCH
[0:52:22] <PaperyHornet1013> SABATOGE FOR MOST WAR POINTS
[0:52:23] <%kingofasgard> TIME TO SNITCH
[0:52:25] <Blackleafx> MORE WAR CRIMES
[0:52:26] <+Soliloquy123> The thing that sucks here is she's not completely wrong that Krogan population will ABSOLUTELY explode
[0:52:26] <%Rumbutt> fuck you
[0:52:27] <blackjack8182> Probably not, but not important right now
[0:52:27] <%Treasure_Vault> "Uplifted" sounds like the Tosk from DS9
[0:52:28] <KeystoneA2> "Let's survive extinction first, okay?"
[0:52:30] <%akscully> eat shit, dalatrass
[0:52:30] <+Vigonept> fuck off
[0:52:33] <dekkitout> Banana Republics in space are nothing to fuck wit
[0:52:34] <%toolofparanoia> FUCK THIS FROG BITCH
[0:52:35] <MrPandastic> The galaxy is at WAR woman! The bullshit you're worried about does not matter.
[0:52:36] <Sp3ctre48> She's not wrong in what she says but I wish it was a character I actually like making this point
[0:52:36] <stantheman_97> she's right but there's literally no other options
[0:52:38] <DatAsuna> this bitch
[0:52:38] <+D00msDayDan> oh man that's so evil
[0:52:39] <%shadowace2400> what a bitch
[0:52:40] <robosqueeb> It's fucked up that she's kinda right, based on how much they breed and how long they live. But still. Fuck the lizard.
[0:52:40] <%chill_o_wisp> SNITCH SNITCH SNITCH
[0:52:41] <@Spydurman> fuck this guy and half the Salarian race
[0:52:41] <+SinnerEbru> DONT COMMIT A WAR CRIME
[0:52:42] <Consumanist> There excessive fucking is a risk to our power dynamic
[0:52:42] <%DianaTheAscian> wow fuck off lady
[0:52:43] <%AmericanSkidd> I think they fixed his neck in the remaster
[0:52:44] <heartlesshealer> drop her
[0:52:46] <yourliteraldog> It would
[0:52:47] <%JoshManVGH> "Commit more War Crimes, Shepard!"
[0:52:49] <%charp35> Snitch
[0:52:50] <TheAntiNihilist> The galaxy will know
[0:52:50] <%Ravioli_Ronin> “This war with the reapers is REALLY bad, but we might have a Kroger war later tho girldmPlead
[0:52:51] <Latija> how about you blow my ass dalatrass
[0:52:51] <%deviljhojho_> renegade sheppard in 3 is such a low IQ blowhard
[0:52:53] <%DrTomT18> @cooldude69xx Not with Wrex in charge. With his brother in charge, then yeah she'd be right.
[0:52:57] <%Eaglestrike117> Fuck the salariens
[0:52:59] <%maenos2> kirrahe already said he'd help so fuck her
[0:53:02] <SaltyAzteca> Thinking about it, thought about it, fuck off
[0:53:03] <+musmayrelchup> god damn, the krogan uplifting was the best and worst thing to happen to them
[0:53:04] <GustauveVIII> HYPPOPOTAMACRITE
[0:53:04] <Madinki> "HEY MAN YOU CAN FUCK IT ALL IF JUST SAYING!"
[0:53:05] <Profmcstevie> BITCH I WILL RECORD YOU
[0:53:06] <DatAsuna> Actually taking her deal is maybe the most evil renegade choice in the series
[0:53:06] <%LumberjackJack> Fuck the dalatrass, holy shit
[0:53:07] <heartlesshealer> extremely shortsighted Dalatrass
[0:53:08] <ingman112> @patstaresat So for the best dialogue, do not share this info with anyone. Go renegade with the secret til the absolute last second; you’ll still have the opportunity to finish paragon
[0:53:08] <+vaderxyz1970> BUT WHAT IF THOUGH
[0:53:09] <%shadowsofpain> Man fuck this lady
[0:53:10] <tinytinykittycat> If Wrex is dead the Krogan never figure it out
[0:53:10] <@Spydurman> Is he Indoctrinated???
[0:53:10] <%deviljhojho_> Javik LOVES it
[0:53:10] <dekkitout> Some wars are cheaper than others
[0:53:11] <PaperyHornet1013> Garrus LIARA
[0:53:11] <yourliteraldog> Fuck them FROGS
[0:53:13] <+thelonechris> No one can declare war on you if they're already dead
[0:53:13] <notsoy> GOD MODE GARRUS
[0:53:13] <%Romuken> @Eaglestrike117 no, fuck the salarian COUNCIL
[0:53:13] <AngryAsian5> "No one would notice." Sure... for like 5 minutes until Krogans started fuckin again. LUL
[0:53:15] <Mattais88> Also they probably won't l=win this one either
[0:53:15] <+ThomasOfTroy> Ehhh, war no, BIG terrorism yes. Too many fighting age krogan would die before they realize they were duped
[0:53:16] <%Ches_Neckbeard> the full support of the salarian fleets....ya know the smallest fleet and military
[0:53:16] <%AmericanSkidd> They would figure it out the second a baby comes out still born
[0:53:17] <%SpcOpsBear> ONLY SABOTAGE CURE WHEN WREAV'S IN CHARGE AND EVE'S DEAD
[0:53:17] <%shurtal> For being from the "smart people" race, Dalatrass Linron is SURPRISINGLY stupid
[0:53:18] <SkinnyRite> EDI!!!!
[0:53:20] <%miguelrod777> garrus or liara
[0:53:20] <+TristonObv> Take Liara
[0:53:21] <Madinki> YEAH
[0:53:21] <Dragovus> She loves war crimes
[0:53:22] <%FaderPotater> its a real bad route based on your preferences so far.
[0:53:22] <%Monkeyweed21> YEA JAVIK
[0:53:24] <%DEETRz> the right choice
[0:53:24] <%kingofasgard> garrus liara is my vote
[0:53:24] <Admiral_PopnFresh> Yeah but the Salarians can win becuase they have overwhelming numbers
[0:53:25] <%strakillias> Garrus and Liara cause history
[0:53:26] <TioXyco> fuck your fleet, gecko lady. you can cut your own tail and shove it up your ass
[0:53:26] <SaltyAzteca> I would go the usual squad
[0:53:26] <+vaderxyz1970> Aim bot Garrus
[0:53:26] <PaperyHornet1013> 1ST GAME GANG
[0:53:27] <cpt_langosta> take javik and his son, garrus
[0:53:27] <%toolofparanoia> And the Reaper killing 9000 garrus
[0:53:28] <%JamesCorck> psaUp psaUp
[0:53:28] <+polothegreatest> snek dude
[0:53:29] <%JoshManVGH> How long do you think the Salarians would last against the Krogan?
[0:53:33] <Sp3ctre48> Even with Wrex in charge, from their perspective it's super risky to bet he can culturally change the Krogan before he dies
[0:53:34] <Madinki> DO IT
[0:53:37] <spuginky> Garrus = EZ mode
[0:53:38] <blackjack8182> Garrus and Liara
[0:53:38] <Blackleafx> pat squeak
[0:53:38] <+TristonObv> Liara has a ton of stuff
[0:53:38] <28moogles> The Krogan can't fight a war with the genophage, that's the whole point of it, not enough of them
[0:53:39] <DatAsuna> @ingman112 how is he supposed to know what the last second is on a blind run?
[0:53:39] <KeystoneA2> Jagvick
[0:53:41] <saddest_man> RACIST OVERLORD GOOOO
[0:53:42] <@Spydurman> that Salarian is so stupid he's basically pro-Reaper
[0:53:45] <%LumberjackJack> Ascended Garrus and BBoomer Javik
[0:53:47] <@ssjklyco> They could at least make it so that they don't have a bunch of dead Krogran babies when birth happens.
[0:53:47] <%kyh9> For what it's worth, the Salarians see a war with the Krogans as one they can win, so long as the genophage is still in place
[0:53:47] <%Ravioli_Ronin> Jarrus and Gavik
[0:53:53] <MrPandastic> Man, all the Salarians except for Mordin and Kirrahe can go fuck off.
[0:53:53] <mattynezz> Yeah, but the Krogans would get their ass kicked in the long run without babies
[0:53:54] <Blackleafx> @ingman112 what dialogue is that now again
[0:53:58] <%deviljhojho_> if they get too uppity just genophage them again whats the big deal 4Head
[0:53:58] <%jackelzxaa> mordin and wrex in the same set of missions is the fucking best
[0:53:59] <%deviljhojho_> its easy
[0:54:00] <%toolofparanoia> Garrus is the Super shotgun of ME3
[0:54:02] <ingman112> @datasuna No way to tell him without spoiling. Just trying to suggest
[0:54:09] <SaltyAzteca> ITS TIME LADS
[0:54:11] <%Romuken> time to stop war with the war gang
[0:54:13] <%kyh9> Th Dalatrass is basically "IF we're gonna fight the Krogans, I want to have the genophage on my side"
[0:54:13] <ingman112> @blackleafx miss steak
[0:54:15] <+vaderxyz1970> I stand by my thought that if not for Cerberus the Salarians would have joined the Reapers

[1:02:49] <%DrTomT18> the Death mask is kinda cool. Reconhood is cooler
[1:02:51] <+Medrex> Spiker is fun. a bit impractical for hard fights but fun
[1:02:53] <+ThomasOfTroy> Everyone: "Oh no! A single reaper! We're doomed!" Shepard: "Fuck all y'all"
[1:02:53] <Blackleafx> yeah its a babby
[1:02:57] <%deviljhojho_> its a pigmyeaper

[1:04:18] <%cooldude69xx> It was too bumpy okay?
[1:04:18] <Radioactive_Jam > it collapsed behind them

[1:04:23] <%MidnightBurst12> truck adrenaline
[1:04:23] <%toolofparanoia> can't hold all of them
[1:04:23] <%jackelzxaa> this is what happens when you don't finish programming a vehicle for your game
[1:04:24] <stantheman_97> it collapsed when the second one went

[1:04:41] <+Vigonept> cause krogans are cool
[1:04:44] <Latija> is this where the star forge map is?
[1:04:45] <%misteroutdated> Because lol
[1:04:46] <%strakillias> Cause most of the trucks would have fallen when it collapsed. Doesn't matter when a turian ship wrecks teh rest of the convoy tho

[1:09:25] <Madinki> @lotharrio I mean Liara might fuck him. Don't think he wants it though
[1:09:28] <%jackelzxaa> the genophage is probably why the galaxy didnt become a warlike covenant like halo with the krogan enslaving the other races
[1:09:37] <cpt_langosta> javik is a fan of the kalros comics, but only the original run
[1:09:41] <%jackelzxaa> it's shit but the situation had gotten to the worst spot it could have been
[1:09:46] <Mattais88> Future Mezoamerican
[1:09:51] <KeystoneA2> @KeystoneA2 Yeah but the little ones they drop off didn't get included.
[1:09:53] <Sp3ctre48> The genophage was super necessary at the time
[1:09:54] <%Monkeyweed21> KALROS BUILT THOSE PYRAMIDS THE KROGAN COULD NEVER SHEPARD

[1:29:58] <thehark90> JAAASSOON

[1:30:01] <%ComfortableStranger> same
[1:30:01] <+Medrex> The main reason I liked the inodctrination theory was because it made this crap bareable
[1:30:01] <blackjack8182> Jason!
[1:30:02] <PaperyHornet1013> This is better if more characters die
[1:30:02] <Gorshum> Me too.
[1:30:03] <%DrTomT18> nah, too depressing
[1:30:03] <%hatok> so you can hear the voices of any characters that died under Shepard's watch during this sequence
[1:30:04] <+thatotherblackson> THIS SCARES YOU, SHEPARD
[1:30:04] <%GueyDuckB> Jason
[1:30:05] <mar_krow> The one inky black it’s words don’t sing

[1:30:07] <Latija> what else could this be
[1:30:07] <%Monkeyweed21> WHY ISNT IT MORDIN

[1:30:13] <%Wurmspawn> Pat did you hear Mordin just then? "Someone Else might gotten it wrong"
[1:30:13] <Agami23> what theory??
[1:30:14] <%machshop> BWAAAAAM
[1:30:14] <%Dakuu75> it looks like his arms & legs are jsut flailing and his model is being slid across the ground

[1:30:15] <DSD24> Bwoooom
[1:30:16] <TheMostAverageGamer4> dont blame you
[1:30:17] <dekkitout> It's a real easy theory to go with, I hear
[1:30:17] <kingmemelord97> whatss that ?
[1:30:18] <%Ravioli_Ronin> Like cut these sequences out and fix the end, and you’ve got like a 10/10
[1:30:18] <AluxStreams> Doesn't help the kid looks identical to Shaun.
[1:30:19] <%xcompleasedad> HE LOOKED LIKE A REAPER
[1:30:19] <KosOrSomeSayKosm_> THE CHILD
[1:30:19] <%maenos2> LUL LUL
[1:30:19] <Latija> LOL
[1:30:20] <stantheman_97> he was RIGHT UNDER a reaper for like five minutes
[1:30:22] <Tracazoid> He ran away better
[1:30:23] <DatAsuna> If only these voice characters were the actual focus of the dream
[1:30:23] <PaperyHornet1013> Get it over with fast pat
[1:30:24] <%trackles_64> its a loop pat
[1:30:24] <Enajy314> LUL
[1:30:25] <%shadowsofpain> Guys just because the devs did a stupid pstd metaphor it doesn't mean indoctrination.
[1:30:26] <+Peacefrog7> they shouldve let you just run around freely and hear the whispers and thats it
[1:30:26] <Apolar_> No I will not save you child
[1:30:27] <%jackelzxaa> indoctrination theory would just be a worse ending because it'd mean there's no ending and no explanation and nothing matters
[1:30:28] <%DrTomT18> Pat please don't draw this out any longer than it has to
[1:30:30] <heartlesshealer> this is kinda tone deaf after Mordin
[1:30:30] <tattleworm> if you look up at the trees, it even looks like neurons
[1:30:31] <%akscully> please don't extend this LUL
[1:30:32] <KeystoneA2> There was a mod that changed this to be your teammates or something that made more sense
[1:30:32] <%xcompleasedad> THAT LITTLE SHIT WAS HUNCHED OVER LIKE A REAPER
[1:30:33] <robosqueeb> some say hes still running
[1:30:33] <SaltyAzteca> Slo Mo Runnin
[1:30:33] <+Goraka91> TBH Indoctrination theory is also super stupid, it's up there with ''Ness is Sans''
[1:30:34] <+redthebaron> one of the best scenes in the series folowed by this
[1:30:35] <tronhd> It's weird that kid haunts your dreams and NOT YOUR DEAD FRIEND!!!!
[1:30:37] <SkinnyRite> I can't see me loving nobody but yooouu
[1:30:38] <tattleworm> there's so much proof for this thing that doesn't exist
[1:30:38] <%LumberjackJack> I still think these sequences would be far better if you were running after the fallen teammates, only to see them burn 1 by 1, before it switches to the ones who aren't dead yet
[1:30:38] <%trackles_64> AShley

[1:31:38] <+redthebaron> after the mordin scene no less
[1:31:38] <$lotharrio> Indoctrination ending would be bad game design. Why would increasingly worse options be the result of the player putting in more effort and time into the game? Why would they still be options?
[1:31:40] <Blackleafx> BENCH

[1:37:14] <%The_Death_Owl> space beetles

[1:37:44] <stantheman_97> them or vorcha

[1:37:46] <%akscully> yahg are the next protheans
[1:37:48] <%AncelDeLambert> the Reapers are leaving the Yahg alone because they don't even have civilization yet
[1:37:55] <%crimsonharvest> the moral of the story, and every story, is always attack and dethrone god
[1:37:55] <%xcompleasedad> That would be WORSE than the Protheans by a LIGHT YEAR
[1:37:59] <%AncelDeLambert> the Yahg don't even have BOWS
[1:38:01] <Alzero83> volus suck, they cant help in this war

[1:39:52] <Blackleafx> big worm
[1:39:54] <%shadowsofpain> you have to get your dailies done
[1:39:55] <tanarath> Multiplayer is optional with a full playthrough.
[1:39:58] <%DrTomT18> @chill_o_wisp what? she gives like 15 extra warscore
[1:40:00] <TheMostAverageGamer4> multiplayer was the best
[1:40:00] <%xcompleasedad> I am sad again that Mordin is dead
[1:40:00] <dekkitout> ... Good question

[1:40:03] <AluxStreams> That was the smallest of the reaper variants.
[1:40:04] <+holyxgrale> 1 worm
[1:40:04] <+goblinking92> That was a baby reaper
[1:40:05] <@QueequegTheater> To the VOD I go
[1:40:05] <+Bob_Tom> that was a small reaper
[1:40:06] <KaiserMario> Other Reapers are bigger
[1:40:08] <Alzero83> i dont think Kalros can eat all the reapers
[1:40:10] <%jackelzxaa> Pat: Most reapers are ten times the size of the one that died
[1:40:10] <+trizetacannon44> They will just crack the planet
[1:40:10] <%KetsuoTaberu> one at a time
[1:40:13] <BurdRightsActivist> @SaltyAzteca They really lowered the bar for this remaster 4Head
[1:40:13] <%Treasure_Vault> Then the queen would eat everything after growing big on reaper juice
[1:40:14] <KeystoneA2> Another MP map
[1:40:15] <SaltyAzteca> Thats too many reapers. It would turn into an orgy
[1:40:16] <%valriot> FUCK
[1:40:17] <DatAsuna> I mean if that reaper had just remembered it could fly, that fight woulda gone very different
[1:40:17] <mattynezz> Multiplayer is awesome just for how many cool classes there where. Like 60
[1:40:18] <%LumberjackJack> Other Reapers are a tad bigger
[1:40:20] <%Rumbutt> Oh look, another multiplayer map!
[1:40:25] <choocheess> or have every spacefaring people go to tchanka
[1:40:26] <arkv01> yeah I think the reapers can just blow planets up

[1:48:27] <Alzero83> Why does space use the emtric system...
[1:48:27] <+SinnerEbru> sovereign was.......sovereign-class
[1:48:28] <Madinki> @Madinki NOW BEAT THE SHIT OUT OF HIM HE LOVES IT
[1:48:35] <%jackelzxaa> pat, that was a baby reaper
[1:48:36] <%MrUnKnownAlien> MrUnKnownAlien subscribed at Tier 1. They've subscribed for 17 months! hey pat still loving these mass effect streams helps the FF14 relic grind but i just got into Guilty Gear strive and love how it feels, so for a new player to Fighting games any tips to help ease getting into it.
[1:48:38] <%DrTomT18> Pat, that's how you get indocturnated!
[1:48:40] <$lotharrio> Man, don't you hate it when sci fi series make up a bunch of unit of measurement? Kappa
[1:48:40] <+holyxgrale> Well the issue with studying reapers
[1:48:43] <%jackelzxaa> that wasnt a real full size reaper
[1:48:44] <%machshop> yeah go ask the worm if you can take a look
[1:48:44] <stantheman_97> yeah but indoctrination
[1:48:44] <%Treasure_Vault> What if it's just underground and gone?
[1:48:44] <%GueyDuckB> worn gun
[1:48:46] <fetelgeuse> Pry the Reaper away from threshermom. somehow?
[1:48:46] <DatAsuna> Every planet before tuchanka had multiple sovereign classes turn up, tuchanka for some reason only gets 1 destroyer
[1:48:47] <%Wallabri> you'd have to get the parts back from the thresher maw tho
[1:48:48] <+Vigonept> babby reaper
[1:48:49] <Deoxplosion> And THAT'S why we don't take them to Tuchnka

[1:48:50] <%xcompleasedad> @PatStaresAt It took it a mile underground. That ain't happening
[1:48:50] <%jackelzxaa> that was basically like infantry
[1:48:52] <heartlesshealer> yeah
[1:48:53] <%Reaviar> i mean good luck taking it from the worm
[1:48:53] <%jackelzxaa> and a real reaper is like a tank
[1:48:54] <%ItsYaGirlMaria> you'd have to get it back from Kalros though
[1:48:55] <choocheess> or figure a way to antman shrink into the reapers asshole and expand
[1:48:55] <%RetroCop87> okay @PatStaresAt , you can take it away from the worm
[1:48:56] <%LumberjackJack> Oh, sure, just Kalros for the parts
[1:48:56] <%walternatorz> now the thresher maw is indoctrinated
[1:48:57] <%AmericanSkidd> You think there is any of it left?
[1:48:57] <%Treasure_Vault> Like the Queen took it to her nest, 50 miles below the ground
[1:48:58] <%Romuken> pretty sure it got ate
[1:49:00] <Dragovus> @PatStaresAt but dead reapers can still mess with your head
[1:49:01] <%Rain_Mage> But Indoctrination
[1:49:02] <%Treasure_Vault> Or 500 miles
[1:49:02] <%castlerock42> That would involve successfully killing the thresher maw in the first place.
[1:49:05] <%crimsonharvest> also getting one that's not destroyed intact instead of destroyed by WMDs
[1:49:08] <%RAGING_1NF3RNO> it might indoctrinate it, though.
[1:49:09] <%InternetShis> Man, thank god those worms are spores that exist on so many backwater worlds
[1:49:09] <Deoxplosion> It was a baby reaper
[1:49:12] <%GarbageNirvana> Eh they'll find it later
[1:49:14] <%Jeemukun> also being near even a dead reaper is a bad idea
[1:49:15] <choocheess> just gotta weaponize thresher maws
[1:49:16] <%jackelzxaa> they took sovereign apart and learned jack shit, pat
[1:49:16] <%Treasure_Vault> The queen ate all of it
[1:49:19] <%InternetShis> Unshielded reaper tech
[1:49:20] <%miguelrod777> also remember even dead gods dream
[1:49:20] <%GarbageNirvana> Just give it some time to digest
[1:49:21] <%Monkeyweed21> @PatStaresAt btw the mail said that Eve and Wrex want to name their kid Mordin
[1:49:23] <%SpcOpsBear> I'm sure the ground attack Reaper was broken into big chunks, since it was crushed.
[1:49:25] <Kat_k> i mean even dead ones indoctrinate you. like the iff mission
[1:49:26] <GohansBeforeHohans> Jokers Thresher Maw gun is soundin like a good idea
[1:49:30] <%InternetShis> Remember the derelict reaper?
[1:49:30] <%SpcOpsBear> So there must be significant pieces on the surface
[1:49:31] <+SaphronBlackbourne> Dead Reapers can still indoctrinate people
[1:49:32] <%LumberjackJack> EDI is uploading the video on YouTube. It has 1 billion views already, Shepard
[1:49:32] <%ahomeschooldropout> You see that tweet the Resident Evil tiwtter account made about RE4?
[1:49:33] <%shadowsofpain> But then indoctrination would happen
[1:49:35] <Vantesla> Threshermaw acid doesn't give a dang about mass effect fields of barriers LUL
[1:49:36] <stantheman_97> what if threasher maws could get indoctrinated
[1:49:37] <TioXyco> do you really wanna fight Kalros over the dea reaper body ownership?
[1:49:38] <%DrTomT18> and Thresher Maw be indocturnated?
[1:49:38] <+holyxgrale> The daughter
[1:49:43] <Jaysky> Hoardin Solus
[1:49:46] <%miguelrod777> a girl specifically LUL
[1:49:47] <%jackelzxaa> if eve dies during that mission wrex has a funeral for her and calls her the mother of tuchunka
[1:49:48] <cpt_langosta> good call
[1:49:49] <%jillyrancher> what have I missed
[1:49:49] <%Treasure_Vault> Oh neat, answers
[1:49:49] <%Wallabri> Urdnot Mordin
[1:49:50] <SaltyAzteca> OH!
[1:49:52] <%crimsonharvest> send the warrior of light

[1:49:56] <DatAsuna> They won't
[1:49:57] <SaltyAzteca> Well there you go
[1:50:00] <%Treasure_Vault> That's fair, don't get indoctrinated
[1:50:04] <%InternetShis> Smart
[1:50:05] <choocheess> thresher MAH! THE MEATLOAF!
[1:50:10] <%jillyrancher> Pat streaming on the day before he said caught me offguard
[1:50:10] <mar_krow> Indoctrinated thresher maw called world eater
[1:50:10] <%DrTomT18> Widow is the Cidadel Mass Relay
[1:50:11] <%walternatorz> maybe there's thresher maws on every planet because they were planted there by protheans
[1:50:12] <%cade_calrayn> oh yeah leaving a Reaper in the center of the Krogan homeworld is probably a REALLY BAD IDEA
[1:50:13] <+Vigonept> sen ryu to shoryuuken it
[1:50:15] <%Rumbutt> Widow is the Citadel, makes sense
[1:50:15] <AngryAsian5> An indoctrinated Mommy Thresher Maw would be horrible though
[1:50:20] <%jillyrancher> psaDogchamp
[1:50:24] <%akscully> no coming through to earth, eh?
[1:50:24] <scrumbotime> Liara please don't be racist
[1:50:26] <%LumberjackJack> Spiiiiiiiiiin
[1:50:28] <%jackelzxaa> liara seems like such a weird, cold, antisocial psycho when you're not romancing her
[1:50:29] <$hattrick61> Imagine indoctrinated Thresher Maws. We'd be fucked
[1:50:29] <dekkitout> They gonna be quads deep, Larry
[1:50:33] <%DrTomT18> I for one welcome our Krogen overlords
[1:50:36] <choocheess> man people have so little faith in the krogan

[1:50:57] <AluxStreams> "Please stop playing with my gamer setup Shepard."
[1:50:57] <%Treasure_Vault> It
[1:50:57] <+holyxgrale> Bold move to make the monitors follow the analog stick
[1:50:58] <tattleworm> asari who only knows matriarchs says "she reminds me of matriarchs
[1:51:01] <%jillyrancher> Female Krogan are infinitely better than any Asari
[1:51:02] <knight_verse> Talk to Battletits for additional war asset points.

[1:52:00] <tanarath> Slight glow, Pat
[1:52:00] <@QueequegTheater> @PatStaresAt Fun fact, if you sabotage the cure, Wreav can be tricked, but Wrex finds out and you have to kill him in self-defense
[1:52:00] <%jackelzxaa> its just a ring around the knuckles
[1:52:01] <%Treasure_Vault> It's messed up you can't walk into your captain's quarters and find tali and liara kissing on your bed, huh

[1:54:04] <%hrbeck_> space irish are worse than the krogan
[1:54:05] <%ahomeschooldropout> It's like calling Kaidan Space Carth
[1:54:05] <%LumberjackJack> Pat's space racism is showing again

[1:54:09] <choocheess> i feel like guy's representative of all employees at ubisoft and act/bl;izz
[1:54:11] <fetelgeuse> No one wants to be your friend, Javik.
[1:54:11] <DSD24> Gotta clean the hands

[1:54:17] <jorniev> it's like space Australia
[1:54:18] <Blackleafx> tsun tsun javik
[1:54:21] <alrobot2014> Javik looks so pretty, then nextdoor you've got Diana
[1:54:23] <%valriot> CUM TRACES
[1:54:26] <%JoshManVGH> She's a cute nerd on a military vessel, people should be falling for her left and right.
[1:54:27] <%trackles_64> Shephard seed everywhere
[1:54:30] <sendart> stop licking the walls
[1:54:31] <%cooldude69xx> It brings to mind the G gundam colonies with space mexico
[1:54:32] <SaltyAzteca> SHE HAD AN ARTIFICIAL ASS
[1:54:34] <%cade_calrayn> she had a fat ass too, Javik
[1:54:35] <%AncelDeLambert> his species is so stupid
[1:54:38] <%InternetShis> There's residue everywhere, Javik... Don't use a blacklight
[1:54:38] <dekkitout> "I detect- a very massive ass, commander"
[1:54:38] <%RealThiele> space OCD
[1:54:40] <scrumbotime> He read her boobsweat dna
[1:54:42] <%machshop> krogan puberty
[1:54:42] <Mattais88> Even someone who never met her knew she was barren
[1:54:42] <choocheess> you'd think the redhead would know the difference between irish and scottish
[1:54:44] <@QueequegTheater> This is overpowered
[1:54:46] <tanarath> Absorbing Miranda's ass dna
[1:54:48] <DSD24> Neo Mexico with TEQUILA GUNDAM
[1:54:51] <%Daxalog> Is Grunt dead?
[1:54:55] <%xcompleasedad> No wonder they ran the galaxy
[1:54:56] <+ThomasOfTroy> It's honestly no wonder that the Protheans DOMINATED in their cycle
[1:54:57] <%jackelzxaa> protheans ACTUALLY were more advanced
[1:54:57] <KeystoneA2> @PatStaresAt Knowing what Protheans like Javik are capable of it's easy to see why they almost started making their own Mass Relays
[1:54:58] <+holyxgrale> Javik was sent by cyberlife monkaS
[1:55:00] <%jillyrancher> motorboat Miranda butt
[1:55:01] <Aiutare47> Protheans are OP as fuck
[1:55:02] <%InternetShis> His quad dropped harder than the Space NASDAQ
[1:55:04] <%Romuken> if only he did it with a FUCKING SCIENTIST
[1:55:05] <%AmericanSkidd> "Commander, I know you had sexual acts with a weak quarian everywhere on this ship"
[1:55:07] <%jackelzxaa> it's no wonder they were emperialists
[1:55:07] <intestinal_bleeding> oh, space manifest destiny, how nice
[1:55:08] <$lotharrio> Look at this fucking four eyes.
[1:55:09] <Blackleafx> :)
[1:55:10] <+wmeldrum> GOOD NAME
[1:55:11] <@commanderclaw> Oh good, social darwinism
[1:55:13] <Jaysky> @Daxalog Our son was too strong for death
[1:55:14] <Dabrikishaw> Javik has a better version of that Life is Strange 3 protag's power
[1:55:15] <%cooldude69xx> @DSD24 THATS THE ONE
[1:55:16] <DSD24> Javik is on the Chaos ROute
[1:55:16] <SaltyAzteca> SPACE DARWINISM
[1:55:17] <%jackelzxaa> they were an actual full evolutionary rung above everyone else
[1:55:22] <%AncelDeLambert> Javik is the first evidence that the writing has taken a backseat in the series at this point
[1:55:23] <+bear_breaker20> javiks all liek: DIVINE WAY BRO
[1:55:24] <%RealThiele> BIG BIO ENGINEERS
[1:55:25] <choocheess> this guys got big puffer jacket looking armor
[1:55:29] <Blank9> javik is measurehead  route
[1:55:32] <%zeroarturia> I want a Tequila Gundam gunpla...
[1:55:33] <BrOOnoh> evolution = magic
[1:55:34] <Dunmarkh> fine, let the reapers win dipshit
[1:55:34] <Profmcstevie> Imperative of the L, YOU FAILED JAVIK
[1:55:35] <%GarbageNirvana> Oh good, a galaxy of Darwinists
[1:55:39] <%machshop> so why'd you even fight
[1:55:40] <%trackles_64> Make a choice
[1:55:42] <%akscully> GUESS YOU GUYS WERE WEAK
[1:55:43] <%AncelDeLambert> oh god here he goes I HATE THIS
[1:55:43] <choocheess> @Blank9 LUL
[1:55:45] <%cooldude69xx> I want Javik to star in the next life is strange
[1:55:45] <SpaceManHotepIV> It's natural so it's good right?
[1:55:49] <+ReallyBigRocks> not actually how evolution works
[1:55:50] <%DrTomT18> Reapers are not a part of Nature
[1:55:50] <%AncelDeLambert> FUCKING SOCIAL DARWINIST HORSESHIT
[1:55:50] <%jackelzxaa> javik is like...what would elves be to elves as elves are to humans?
[1:55:52] <DSD24> @cooldude69xx Dood Tequila Gundam with its Sombero and Trident is the dumbest shit but I love it
[1:55:53] <$lotharrio> Probably doesn't think of them as a species.
[1:55:55] <%Ravioli_Ronin> Omg did they really just say “yeah fuck those guys, we’re strong enough to fight the reapers tho”
[1:55:59] <+ReallyBigRocks> mice are pretty fuckin weak
[1:56:01] <@QueequegTheater> "Might makes right" says last survivor of his weak bitch species
[1:56:03] <%LumberjackJack> Javik's a schmuck from the 1800s that's all "DARWINISM, GUYS"
[1:56:05] <%InternetShis> Yeah but society allows advancment in knowledge if we keep the weak alive
[1:56:05] <dekkitout> That aint evolution, cheif
[1:56:06] <+bear_breaker20> shepherd needs to think about this
[1:56:07] <%sashagreenspiderqueen> thats not what anarchy is shepard limesHeck
[1:56:08] <%jackelzxaa> he is an actual greater species
[1:56:10] <+ThomasOfTroy> But if the reapers are so strong, then why is Javik still alive?? Checkmate atheists!
[1:56:10] <%akscully> protheans suck ass
[1:56:11] <Admiral_PopnFresh> THE GREATER GOOD
[1:56:12] <+holyxgrale> Javik's people are not dead
[1:56:13] <Jolly_Adventurer> The greater good
[1:56:13] <$SGrim> NATIONALIST
[1:56:14] <Alzero83> That sounds like Reaper talk
[1:56:16] <%crimsonharvest> hilarious to believe that only on an individual and not societal level
[1:56:18] <%Rumbutt> The batarians would've
[1:56:20] <%Ravioli_Ronin> Ok buddy hasMods
[1:56:21] <SaltyAzteca> Youre always gonna have conflict one way of another
[1:56:22] <%MidnightBurst12> i like Javik's voice effects
[1:56:25] <chainsaw105> damn Javik out here with the fuckin Sword Logic
[1:56:26] <%jackelzxaa> it's funny that protheans were actual fascists
[1:56:27] <%AncelDeLambert> Javik is what a Baptist Extremist thinks an Atheist is
[1:56:28] <cpt_langosta> evolution =/= social darwinism
[1:56:32] <%jackelzxaa> the advanced race were just all hitlers
[1:56:45] <%Dakuu75> not a bad answer
[1:56:45] <quipquest1> “The rich get richer and the poor stay poor.”
[1:56:52] <%jackelzxaa> garrus isn't a fascist, but javik actually unapologetically is
[1:56:52] <DSD24> Don't forget Windmill Gundam
[1:56:53] <%RetroCop87> that's a good line
[1:56:56] <%InternetShis> Well he was literally born into an extinction event
[1:56:58] <%machshop> space five gum

[1:57:00] <$lotharrio> "Commander... War... wat never changes."

[1:57:02] <Jaysky> Chew 5 Gum.
[1:57:05] <+ReallyBigRocks> I hate the holes on the back of his head
[1:57:06] <cpt_langosta> nice one

[1:57:34] <dekkitout> God I wish Samara were here to spike this dillweed into the floor
[1:57:35] <%The_Death_Owl> Mans been reading some Ayn Rand
[1:57:35] <+hmgirlpopuri> I don't know what's worse to not have in the base game.  Javik, or the Leviathan DLC
[1:57:35] <%AncelDeLambert> @jillyrancher LUL
[1:57:36] <@QueequegTheater> @PatStaresAt I should point out that taking the salarian deal 100% gets Wrex killed
[1:57:37] <KeystoneA2> Don't spam the button. Unless it bugged out. Again.
[1:57:37] <LightningLynx89> Yo Javik would've taken the Salarian deal
[1:57:39] <%DrTomT18> I understand WHY Javik is the way that he is. I just don't agree with it
[1:57:39] <%xcompleasedad> @scrumbotime They colony dropped a LOT
[1:57:40] <%valriot> Javik-Selch over here
[1:57:40] <+polothegreatest> just numbers shep
[1:57:40] <TheMostAverageGamer4> hot take
[1:57:42] <ExemplarKyle> So Javik is an asshole renegade to the N'th degree
[1:57:42] <spuginky> man Javik rules
[1:57:43] <%moonmintparadise> Javik does not even get the idea that collectively you could be stronger than the reapers
[1:57:44] <%akscully> your philosophy sucks and got your people killed
[1:57:44] <%Ravioli_Ronin> psaWrong psaWrong psaWrong psaWrong
[1:57:46] <%Agami23> javik is minmaxing his friendships

[1:57:50] <%jackelzxaa> steve's nice
[1:57:50] <$lotharrio> Javik: "Look up guides and min-max war readiness, Commander."
[1:57:52] <+redthebaron> protheans are so powerful they clip
[1:58:00] <%InternetShis> YO ESTEBAN
[1:58:01] <Jaysky> @scrumbotime Because they can super populate and live a long time and are super versatile making them a huge galactic threat if left unchecked
[1:58:01] <%jackelzxaa> pat make sure you don't accidentally romance anyone
[1:58:02] <%pokefan9956> was that a homestar reference
[1:58:02] <%DrTomT18> that sounds pretty cool tbh
[1:58:08] <%RealThiele> i mean Javik is an end generation prothean so their society was fucked by then
[1:58:13] <%jackelzxaa> in the back half of the game its possible to accidentally lock in the wrong character before you meet tali
[1:58:20] <choocheess> that omnitool welding looks kinda weird
[1:58:22] <cpt_langosta> "I can't believe those Nazis tried to kill those people!"

[2:00:19] <%sunsetdisc0> the mnemonic visor is p good for vanguards imo
[2:00:20] <tattleworm> very paragon
[2:00:20] <%AncelDeLambert> well, try the rest of the armor
[2:00:20] <Lamokmok> Oh, the Vanguard default helmet in MP
[2:00:21] <+animaturgy> that was my favorite one too
[2:00:21] <$Teh_Un> It's a Cerberus helmet
[2:00:21] <tanarath> Fashion Effect
[2:00:23] <%shadowsofpain> It looks good
[2:00:26] <%RealThiele> >|
[2:00:28] <Madinki> FASHION EFFECT
[2:00:28] <%jackelzxaa> pat you might have better armor..
[2:00:33] <Sp3ctre48> I didn't know that was supposed to be a Krogan helmet lol
[2:00:35] <%jackelzxaa> the health boost is kinda meh
[2:00:36] <AxelCezar> looks like a slick from oddworld
[2:00:36] <@QueequegTheater> @DatAsuna Oh yeah, but in terms of general feel, James would fit right in with Ramirez's squad
[2:00:39] <tronhd> you have barrier
[2:00:40] <TioXyco> are you?
[2:00:44] <DSD24> We need bulkier armor to fith being a Vanguard
[2:00:46] <+ALazo> You're a vanguard, you can do whatever you want
[2:00:49] <choocheess> yeah but have you hit the power cieling?!
[2:00:51] <cpt_langosta> helmet looks like frog
[2:00:54] <KosOrSomeSayKosm_> yeye spaceknights
[2:00:54] <+holyxgrale> The n7 armor is just too good
[2:00:55] <@QueequegTheater> You're also on baby mode
[2:00:57] <%AncelDeLambert> didn't you find more than one Death Mask piece?
[2:01:06] <+holyxgrale> I had the same issue in witcher
[2:01:08] <%LumberjackJack> I love the armor set that gives max weapon damage. Just covered in heat sinks like they were shotgun shells
[2:01:11] <%AncelDeLambert> weird
[2:01:11] <perfectharbinger> Not gonna lie, armor doesn't feel very good in this game.
[2:01:18] <%jillyrancher> Fashion montage!
[2:01:18] <%SpcOpsBear> Death Mask is head armor only I think
[2:01:22] <yourliteraldog> armor in 3 weird
[2:01:24] <%chill_o_wisp> max out power recharge lol
[2:01:24] <KeystoneA2> The Ariake Set is the coolest, but it's not good if you aren't a melee style build
[2:01:28] <DSD24> All you need is the Death Mask
[2:01:28] <+FelIian> there's a mod that makes one of the Cerberus armor's black and red and it's sick
[2:01:31] <AluxStreams> It's Fashion Effect.
[2:01:31] <@Moobot> Hey folks, just a reminder! If you have Twitch connected to Discord, you can access the PSA Sub-Discord. Go to your User Settings, go to Connections, and click 'Join' on the PSA server under the Twitch connection.
[2:01:32] <%jackelzxaa> i always go for weapon and headshot damage in me3
[2:01:35] <%DrTomT18> Pat, you leveled up
[2:01:46] <ingman112> @patstaresat So if you don’t reveal the sabotage, Mordin figures it out on his own. When you try to stop him from going up, it turns into a gunpoint standoff where he reveals his long-standing personal guilt about his role in the genophage
[2:01:56] <%jillyrancher> save that shit
[2:02:04] <%SpcOpsBear> "I MADE A MISTAKE!"
[2:02:04] <KeystoneA2> @FelIian I have that. N7 colored Ajax armor is legit cool looking. Also the recolored N7 harrier mod.
[2:02:08] <%deviljhojho_> cant stop wont stop
[2:02:12] <cpt_langosta> not a good enough reason at all
[2:02:12] <@commanderclaw> Youtube
[2:02:13] <DatAsuna> Just youtube it later
[2:02:15] <%deviljhojho_> hmm
[2:02:15] <yourliteraldog> good
[2:02:17] <ingman112> @patstaresat It’s a great scene, arguably the best for Mordin’s character development, and you still get to cure the genophage. But the paragon’s still great! Just wanted to float the possibility that we’d see it
[2:02:17] <PaperyHornet1013> And you can kill him and destroy the cure
[2:02:18] <%jackelzxaa> if you kill mordin then wrex hunts you down for betrayal, pat
[2:02:21] <%LumberjackJack> Kiss Mordin on his damaged ear
[2:02:21] <choocheess> kiss his name plaque
[2:02:25] <%valriot> Renegade route is FUCKED UP for that plot line
[2:02:29] <%jackelzxaa> and then youre forced to gun wrex down too
[2:02:30] <%jillyrancher> based Pat
[2:02:31] <%AncelDeLambert> don't kiss grandpa on the mouth, that's weird
[2:02:32] <ThatGuyThere03> Does Paige know about your undying love for the Clint Eastwood lizard?
[2:02:32] <+holyxgrale> @PatStaresAt Did you know you can paragon mordin out of curing the genophage as well?
[2:02:35] <+hmgirlpopuri> You have to be cold blooded as shit to do full renegade in this game.  They make you pull the trigger and shoot Mordin in the back
[2:02:35] <@commanderclaw> It has Mordin's best line read in the series IMO
[2:02:36] <%crimsonharvest> so the milky way is about 70000 light years across right
[2:02:37] <%AmericanSkidd> it hurts my soul to see it
[2:02:39] <%strakillias> They just wanted you to accidently shoot him cause its a renegade prompt
[2:02:41] <%RJay80> deep kiss?
[2:02:41] <%LumberjackJack> hasO
[2:02:42] <@QueequegTheater> @PatStaresAt If you kill Mordin to stop the genophage, Wrex figures it out and tries to kill you on the Citadel, then dies
[2:02:42] <PaperyHornet1013> Kill the war criminal pat
[2:02:43] <+FelIian> @KeystoneA2 yea, literally wore that armor through the whole game LOL
[2:02:43] <DSD24> There's that really cool 90 percent Renegade 10 percent Paragon outcome where you don't shoot Mordin at the last second
[2:02:43] <cpt_langosta> suck on his one longer head horn
[2:02:45] <arkv01> just REALLY get in there
[2:02:45] <Madinki> @ingman112 Yeah well too bad
[2:02:50] <%jackelzxaa> if you confront mordin and DONT pull the trigger it's a very good alternative to the renegade scene
[2:02:51] <%Wurmspawn> So yeah, chat, you need to let go of seeing Pat react to this game in the same sequence and way that YOU want. Let HIM play the game.
[2:02:52] <%deviljhojho_> i refuse
[2:02:54] <stormhawk9891> Kiss his charred corpse on the mouth
[2:02:56] <%DrTomT18> did you mod out the Reaper alerts, Pat?
[2:02:57] <%Monkeyweed21> Its Mordin's best line in the series
[2:02:59] <SaltyAzteca> Who's ready for BWAAAAAAAAAAAM
[2:03:00] <DatAsuna> @jackelzxaa Or you can make bailey do it then crack a racist joke
[2:03:00] <+AmuserName> ELCOR HOMEWORLD PogChamp
[2:03:01] <%jillyrancher> Renegade choices in ME3 are usually stupid and bad tbh
[2:03:01] <%AmericanSkidd> make me
[2:03:01] <%RJay80> no
[2:03:03] <Jolly_Adventurer> NO ONE CLIP IT
[2:03:03] <robosqueeb> nobody clip that
[2:03:03] <%cade_calrayn> clip that and send it to Paige
[2:03:07] <%shadowsofpain> Pat you may have good enough pistol ultralight materials to have a pistol as well as your shotgun
[2:03:12] <DSD24> I made him a steak!
[2:03:15] <+AmuserName> *Volus
[2:03:17] <Blackleafx> BRRRRRRRRRRRRR
[2:03:18] <alrobot2014> why are we allowed to just probe the volus homeworld
[2:03:19] <perfectharbinger> Clip it and send it to Woolie lol.
[2:03:20] <%Wulfphelz> First thing I come into is ‘kiss them on the mouth’… hot… psaUp
[2:03:22] <BurdRightsActivist> Nobody clip it
[2:03:28] <+lambda_luke> make sure to probe uranus pat Kappa
[2:03:31] <yourliteraldog> REVERBBBB
[2:03:32] <%LumberjackJack> Pretty much. These fetch quests really blow
[2:03:34] <+holyxgrale> Wow a popup in the bottom left PogChamp
[2:03:34] <choocheess> woah
[2:03:35] <@QueequegTheater> Anyone who clips it is banned Kappa
[2:03:35] <Sp3ctre48> I got [side quest reward]
[2:03:36] <%crimsonharvest> hungory
[2:03:37] <+SinnerEbru> NICE
[2:03:43] <%trackles_64> scanning is so boring
[2:03:45] <KosOrSomeSayKosm_> it's like carving bug monsters in monhun "oh I got...a thing!"
[2:03:46] <%cobalt_phoenix_> BWOOOOOOONG
[2:03:47] <%ahomeschooldropout> According to the ME website Mordin is 50 YEARS OLD. HE WILL LITERALLY PROBABLY DIE A DAY AFTER THE GENOPHAGE CURE IF HE SURVIVED
[2:03:47] <%hewlettfan96> NOBODy clips anything kapeesh
[2:03:49] <tinytinykittycat> wasnt that the volus homeworld?
[2:03:49] <perfectharbinger> At least the "Reapers want to kick your shit in" theme is enjoyable.
[2:03:52] <choocheess> jeez
[2:03:53] <%zuzuxiv> HOLY SHIT
[2:03:54] <tanarath> Grats, Pat, now the reapers are at the Volus homeworld
[2:03:54] <Blackleafx> JEEZ
[2:03:55] <$hattrick61> @patstaresat Also unfun fact: if you kill wrex in 1 And destroy maelons data in 2 causing Eve to die, you can talk him into sabotaging the cure
[2:03:56] <%Romuken> SLICK
[2:03:57] <ExemplarKyle> SO CLOSE
[2:03:57] <%deviljhojho_> by the skin of his teeth
[2:03:58] <cpt_langosta> *noises*
[2:04:02] <+dd44dostivei> outrunning reapers feels like 1970s gameplay
[2:04:04] <%twistedj3ster> I think part of the issue is the pacing of the trilogy
[2:04:05] <%shadowsofpain> those were 2 very close calls
[2:04:06] <%jillyrancher> if Woolie played ME2 and 3 do you think he'd make his armor entirely green
[2:04:11] <%deviljhojho_> get probed idiot
[2:04:15] <Admiral_PopnFresh> They want to grab your ass
[2:04:18] <%DrTomT18> Read the lore on it!
[2:04:18] <KeystoneA2> That's the only one they have lol
[2:04:22] <cpt_langosta> WHO KEEPS DROPPING ITEMS INTO GAS GIANTS STOP THAT
[2:04:22] <tanarath> They do!
[2:04:24] <%Alig200> Volus literally only make bombing dreanoughts iirc
[2:04:25] <jorniev> what happens if they catch up?
[2:04:25] <%InternetShis> I think the only way to get the krogan and salarians on board is if Wrex is dead, you convince Mordin to not cure them, fake his death, Urdnot Wreav buys it, and Mordin helps the Crucible project in secret
[2:04:25] <%cooldude69xx> "Kwunu wats this?"
[2:04:26] <@QueequegTheater> He'd make it purple for the Unit-01 cosplay
[2:04:28] <choocheess> does the thing keep beeping after one button press or is pat just pressing liek a madman?
[2:04:29] <Blackleafx> Brrrrrrrr
[2:04:36] <DickieWoodsmall_279> if I remember correctly, when the reapers catch you literally nothing happens
[2:04:37] <yourliteraldog> Its there only one and huge ass wmd
[2:04:38] <%shadowsofpain> purple with green highlights, aka Unit 1 lol
[2:04:53] <robosqueeb> I farted a couple nights ago into the toilet and it deadass sounded EXACTLY like the reaper BWAAMPPF
[2:04:58] <yourliteraldog> BURRRB
[2:05:01] <+SinnerEbru> good luck gettin out lmao
[2:05:03] <@QueequegTheater> @shadowsofpain In fairness that's also my alt's glam in FFXIV
[2:05:07] <%shadowsofpain> @dickiewoodsmall_279 you get sn instant game over
[2:05:09] <%jillyrancher> you can get some Salarian support anyway
[2:05:16] <%deviljhojho_> BRAAAAAAAAAAA
[2:05:22] <Sp3ctre48> It does!
[2:05:22] <Ardailec> Yep
[2:05:23] <%jackelzxaa> wait, i've been a sub for months but i don't see a join psa server option under connections
[2:05:24] <Goatllama> @robosqueeb is your ass a reaper????
[2:05:24] <+holyxgrale> Yea
[2:05:25] <%LumberjackJack> Yuuuuuuuuup. The game of highs and lows
[2:05:26] <%jillyrancher> STG helps regardless iirc
[2:05:28] <DSD24> ME3 is complicated
[2:05:28] <%Nobrev> I like the BWOOMM sound
[2:05:31] <+redthebaron> it is a land of contrast
[2:05:31] <%walternatorz> YUP
[2:05:31] <%InternetShis> Yup
[2:05:32] <$hattrick61> reaper BRAAAAPPP
[2:05:32] <tanarath> It's very KOTOR 2
[2:05:32] <Jaysky> Cause it was
[2:05:32] <cpt_langosta> that's ME3 for you
[2:05:32] <%deviljhojho_> its the return of the jedi of mass effect
[2:05:33] <supergoblinpunch> Yep
[2:05:35] <%shootbang_exe> yeah this game is undercooked as shit
[2:05:36] <%trackles_64> They rushed it for holiday relase like usual
[2:05:37] <+ReallyBigRocks> almost like it was
[2:05:37] <LockingKey> bioware magic
[2:05:38] <%DrTomT18> a bit
[2:05:39] <@commanderclaw> Fuck EA
[2:05:40] <%jackelzxaa> ME3 absolutely needed a full year delay
[2:05:40] <%AncelDeLambert> that's because it was rushed AF
[2:05:40] <Madinki> HAHA REAPER GO BRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRR
[2:05:41] <SaltyAzteca> Yeah thats....thats the feel
[2:05:41] <DSD24> Pretty High Highs
[2:05:41] <stormhawk9891> yep
[2:05:41] <DickieWoodsmall_279> @shadowsofpain but what does that mean when it sends you back like 60sec tops
[2:05:42] <+holyxgrale> There was some pretty neat mods for the original though
[2:05:42] <dekkitout> Productions are speedrun attempts now
[2:05:42] <perfectharbinger> Almost like it was lol.
[2:05:42] <Lamokmok> Because it was
[2:05:44] <%SpcOpsBear> They obviously focused on the narrative experience and the core gameplay more than the non-combat gameplay
[2:05:44] <+dd44dostivei> its the return of the jedi
[2:05:44] <+senfood> The Battle of Tuchanka was legit goddamn amazing. And then we start scanning...
[2:05:44] <%Monkeyweed21> BIOWARE MAGIC
[2:05:45] <DSD24> Lowest of low lows
[2:05:46] <BurdRightsActivist> SOMEHOW? 4Head
[2:05:47] <%RealThiele> cuz it was
[2:05:50] <robosqueeb> @Goatllama yes, it is a reaper, and my poops went through the ass relay
[2:05:50] <yourliteraldog> I feel like there was more to this they didn't get to like pew pew
[2:05:50] <%Retinolgaming> I still like that the character focused stuff is the good stuff though.
[2:05:50] <+Bail_Seven> Ea would never publish soemthing with less time than needed
[2:05:52] <%LumberjackJack> Didn't ME3 have the lowest development time of the trilogy?
[2:05:52] <tanarath> Also, it WAS rushed
[2:05:54] <%InternetShis> Act 3 is gonna be fuuun
[2:05:54] <%DrTomT18> Can a book really be rushed?
[2:05:55] <jorniev> JUST LIKE DEAD SPACE 3
[2:05:56] <ThatGuyThere03> 14 months dududududu
[2:05:57] <%deviljhojho_> B I O W A R E M A G I C
[2:06:00] <%jillyrancher> @patstaresat It IS Rushed AF
[2:06:01] <@DakotaMacDoodle> Maybe needed another year in the oven but you know EA
[2:06:04] <Goatllama> THE ASS RELAY
[2:06:04] <%DrTomT18> You mean Kotor 2? lol
[2:06:06] <Jaysky> This game could have been amazing, instead it was rushed out the door
[2:06:06] <%Treuan> :(
[2:06:09] <tanarath> 2 years less than ME 1 & 2 @patstaresat
[2:06:10] <blackjack8182> 18 months of development I believe
[2:06:10] <%Mr___Pillow> big true true
[2:06:11] <tuesti> if only the industry didnt suck ass
[2:06:11] <tinytinykittycat> just EA going gib money now
[2:06:11] <dekkitout> Film and book have been around much longer by comparison
[2:06:13] <%InternetShis> Cats
[2:06:16] <perfectharbinger> Books can absolutely be rushed. It's just not as common.
[2:06:17] <Profmcstevie> Well you can push out an unfinished game better than a movie
[2:06:19] <cpt_langosta> you see it in movies, too, especially if they don't finish the final sequence special effects
[2:06:19] <TheMostAverageGamer4> def movies and video games
[2:06:20] <%DrTomT18> This game needed an act 4
[2:06:20] <%trackles_64> Cats
[2:06:20] <KeystoneA2> Yeah but in this game's case the ending would've still overshadowed it.
[2:06:20] <+holyxgrale> Story of mass effect 3: we just need more time :(
[2:06:23] <%Monkeyweed21> Dragon 2 was like 12 months
[2:06:25] <Mattais88> Metal Gear 5 is the same
[2:06:27] <+Vigonept> look at game of thrones, 100 years
[2:06:28] <Jaysky> It's still great but it isn't nearly as polished as it could have been
[2:06:28] <PaperyHornet1013> Its already great let the gamer rage go pat
[2:06:30] <%LumberjackJack> Unless the editing is dogshit, yeah
[2:06:30] <%ComfortableStranger> andromeda was SUPER rushed
[2:06:31] <Gloppie> But pat, have you considered that BWAAAAAOOOOOOHHHH
[2:06:32] <blackjack8182> Dragon Age 2 had even less time
[2:06:37] <%InternetShis> More like the Feline
[2:06:39] <tattleworm> the bad stuff in this has nothing to do with time, it's because the idiot lead writers decided to handle it solo with no input from the rest of the team
[2:06:40] <%Wulfphelz> MgsV tomatoDry
[2:06:40] <xanerts> Csts
[2:06:41] <%DrTomT18> MGS is the poster child for unfinished games
[2:06:41] <robosqueeb> what is it with the 3rd entries in games being cursed? ME, DA, DS, Diablo...
[2:06:42] <%Mr___Pillow> GoT last season be palpable
[2:06:44] <DSD24> MGS5 was pretty rushed
[2:06:45] <xanerts> Cats
[2:06:48] <%hrbeck_> you don't spend 60 hours on a bad movie
[2:06:49] <%JoshManVGH> You can sure get that with TV shows!
[2:06:51] <KeystoneA2> What this game needed was for Casey Hudson to have not locked himself in a room and written the ending in like a week
[2:06:53] <%trackles_64> Well in most movie cases they run out of money
[2:06:53] <+dd44dostivei> maybe your video game tastes are more sophisticated
[2:06:55] <%cvp5127> movies arent 30 hours
[2:06:58] <%DrTomT18> HA good point
[2:06:59] <%machshop> oof
[2:07:01] <GuyverTypeL> where is my chapter 3 mgsv
[2:07:01] <Goatllama> where's the Cats asshole cut
[2:07:02] <robosqueeb> game of what?
[2:07:06] <$lotharrio> Justice League
[2:07:07] <%JoshManVGH> Legend of Korra very much felt like that
[2:07:08] <DXLelouch24> Expanded Galaxy Mod did it for me but it has to be brought over first
[2:07:09] <%JamesCorck> The Postman is.
[2:07:11] <DatAsuna> Nah game of thrones wasn't a time issue, it was a creative issue
[2:07:11] <cpt_langosta> what's game of thrones is that some kind of movie or something
[2:07:12] <tinytinykittycat> In other industries the meddling happens in the planning stage but they usually let them make the thing
[2:07:12] <choocheess> are there more systems with reapers hanging over them?
[2:07:13] <%walternatorz> the people who make decision for movies can spend 2 hours reviewing their progress, imagine if they played through a game
[2:07:13] <ape_hawk> lotr extended cut?
[2:07:13] <%jackelzxaa> game of thrones ending might be worse than mass effect 3
[2:07:13] <%JamesCorck> The Post is 30 hours long.
[2:07:15] <@QueequegTheater> I've seen The Tenth Kingdom
[2:07:16] <+Bail_Seven> have you guys heard of bollywood
[2:07:16] <%LumberjackJack> Shows can be. GoT felt rushed, as mentioned already
[2:07:17] <Dragovus> @PatStaresAt You should do the system with the Mass Relay last so you don't have as hard a time as you leave the cluster
[2:07:17] <%deviljhojho_> satantango is longer than some games tbh
[2:07:18] <dekkitout> @cvp5127 Not after editors get to them
[2:07:19] <+ThomasOfTroy> Unpopular Opnion: I liked GoT's last season
[2:07:19] <%jillyrancher> I'm replaying Dead Space 3 right now and thought itd by far the worst I still really enjoy.
[2:07:20] <%FaderPotater> imagine a movie coming out and it was like this movie is bricking tvs
[2:07:21] <%JamesCorck> The Postman is 30 hours long.
[2:07:21] <%trackles_64> Snack Zyfer movie was still terrible
[2:07:21] <+dd44dostivei> what about that napoleon movie from the 20s
[2:07:23] <@QueequegTheater> Or whatever the fuck that was called
[2:07:24] <%JamesCorck> Holyshit it does.
[2:07:24] <@OfficioPrefectusCorgi> Lord Of the Rings Extanded
[2:07:24] <+beansoup> Game of thrones was bad for as long as it was good. anything past season 4 is SYFY channel tier.
[2:07:25] <pr0phetrahl> I’m confused. The scanning is the parsley for this game. It’s not meant to be full of depth because people didn’t like the scanning stuff before.
[2:07:26] <%shadowsofpain> ig
[2:07:26] <DSD24> Didn't GOT just get phoned in
[2:07:27] <%GueyDuckB> TV gets that
[2:07:27] <%JamesCorck> Yeah it's garbage.
[2:07:28] <perfectharbinger> I don't know, Batman vs Superman felt 30 hours long. Does that count? lol.
[2:07:29] <Profmcstevie> If you had to marinade in a 50 hour movie that was not finished, oh BOY you'd know
[2:07:29] <yourliteraldog> what did jack do
[2:07:29] <%DrTomT18> There is a movie called Empire thats like 100 hours long thats just footage of the Empire State Building
[2:07:29] <%jackelzxaa> lord of the rings extended cut trilogy is a perfect series of films
[2:07:30] <DatAsuna> DB and weiss had to be fought just to get an 8th season made at all. They were the reason it had no time.
[2:07:31] <%Ynkubus_> there are some movies that are up there in length

[2:07:44] <robosqueeb> I can't believe how hard dnd fucked GoT
[2:07:48] <%JoshManVGH> Twin Peaks has secretly been a 30 hour movie all along.
[2:07:49] <%count_bob> @jackelzxaa It really, really is.

[2:07:55] <%SpcOpsBear> "The Innocence" is a 21 hour film and is considered the current longest film in existence.
[2:07:56] <%jackelzxaa> the hobbit maple films edit is a really good way to enjoy the hobbit.  (it cuts the 3 films into one 4 hour film that's basically just the stuff from the book)
[2:07:56] <%crimsonharvest> @PatStaresAt did you every play Star Control II / Ur Quan Masters its like the most proto version of this it rules
[2:07:57] <DSD24> Kevin Costner was in Waterworld
[2:07:58] <Mattais88> I want an avant guard movie that lasts 20 hours and has all of TTGL inside it
[2:07:58] <%shadowsofpain> it's a problem with TV series and video games
[2:07:59] <%Mr___Pillow> YES
[2:08:05] <%DrTomT18> what has he even been in?
[2:08:06] <Admiral_PopnFresh> yes
[2:08:06] <%twistedj3ster> if you move a bunch of planets from that galaxy, is it still the same galaxy?
[2:08:07] <%machshop> he was okay in Dances with Wolves
[2:08:08] <+PenmanLupine> what the fuck we going after Kevin Costner?
[2:08:08] <%LumberjackJack> Hey, it's Feros
[2:08:09] <Dabrikishaw> Man of Stell is all I remember him in
[2:08:09] <$lotharrio> I sort of liked him in Water World?
[2:08:10] <perfectharbinger> Hi Feros!
[2:08:10] <MelonSouda> But Waterworld was a GREAT movie though
[2:08:11] <%Wulfphelz> I feel like you can feel that feeling in songs too
[2:08:17] <%SpcOpsBear> Well, longest non-experimental film.
[2:08:20] <choocheess> i wish it was a different actor in waterworld
[2:08:20] <%cooldude69xx> Thats how  ifeel about Wil Smith
[2:08:21] <+dd44dostivei> he's an okay pensive white dude
[2:08:21] <DSD24> He was in Man of Steel right?
[2:08:23] <+AmuserName> @PatStaresAt FUN FACT: a huge portion of the planets that you find items on in this game are the uncharted worlds you explored in the mako in ME1. Like Eletania.
[2:08:27] <DickieWoodsmall_279> Kevin Costner was in Water World
[2:08:28] <+hmgirlpopuri> I can't think of him without seeing him as 'Maybe you should let a bus of children die, Superman' in Man of Steel
[2:08:31] <choocheess> probably would of done better
[2:08:33] <yourliteraldog> wasn't in alot of shit cus he was what people thought hot was
[2:08:33] <robosqueeb> David Lynch just remade the last thing you watched, is it better or worse?
[2:08:39] <%RealThiele> waterworld LUL
[2:08:44] <@QueequegTheater> @robosqueeb yes
[2:08:49] <perfectharbinger> @hmgirlpopuri Precisely.
[2:08:50] <$lotharrio> I think he got a lot of good will from Field of Dreams.
[2:08:50] <+polothegreatest> martin ruined it by no tfinishing the series
[2:08:54] <%shadowsofpain> wanna read ferros?
[2:08:54] <%machshop> @robosqueeb neither but somehow i enjoyed it more

[2:09:18] <%SpcOpsBear> THAT'S 5 WEEKS
[2:09:18] <%Retinolgaming> @PatStaresAt Field of dreams was pretty good.
[2:09:18] <%DrTomT18> This is a bait system
[2:09:23] <@QueequegTheater> Jebaited
[2:09:23] <%LumberjackJack> This is the Rachni cluster
[2:09:24] <KeystoneA2> Ninmah Cluster is one of the weird places in this game that can't be 100% because there's nothing in it
[2:09:25] <%DrTomT18> I do the same thing
[2:09:26] <godzookylives> @robosqueeb It was Ghost in the Shell so that would make one hell of a movie
[2:09:26] <%RealThiele> c-c-c-combo braker
[2:09:27] <%walternatorz> I never watched a complete Kevin Costner film. It was always during those saturday airings that you channel surf to half through
[2:09:27] <Mattais88> EVERY TIME
[2:09:30] <%jillyrancher> Do you think Game of Thrones will finisher will it end up like Berserk
[2:09:35] <yourliteraldog> If david lynch made evangelion 3.0+ 1.0 I feel like it just be diffrently baffling
[2:09:37] <%afronooch> yep
[2:09:40] <%AmericanSkidd> yes
[2:09:44] <%trackles_64> Yeah yopu get blocked from doing  it
[2:09:47] <perfectharbinger> Yeah, do that now.
[2:09:48] <$lotharrio> It's a pretty big switcheroo point.
[2:09:51] <cpt_langosta> microsoft bob
[2:09:51] <%RealThiele> GoT is over already GRRM just milking the fame and money
[2:09:52] <DatAsuna> citadel is big progression yes
[2:09:54] <%DrTomT18> Pat, level up!!
[2:09:56] <%castlerock42> This mission better not be what I think it is.
[2:09:58] <@QueequegTheater> @jillyrancher Who cares anymore though
[2:10:08] <yourliteraldog> Multi Playe map
[2:10:10] <djblue_shift> for everyone's favorite squadmate
[2:10:11] <%InternetShis> Oh did Citadel thing happen immediately after Tuchanks?
[2:10:11] <perfectharbinger> You don't get blocked from this mission if you go to the Citadel but it's recommended you do this first.
[2:10:11] <tinytinykittycat> I'm not sure it matters
[2:10:11] <@QueequegTheater> @castlerock42 Kappa
[2:10:13] <+GuilKato> take edi?
[2:10:16] <%SpcOpsBear> @castlerock42 this is an N7 mission so it probably isn't
[2:10:20] <%jtdobyns> why nit liara
[2:10:21] <%LumberjackJack> This mission was the easiest to cheese in the ME multiplayer before they patched a part of the level!
[2:10:22] <yourliteraldog> This one of the weaker ones
[2:10:23] <DickieWoodsmall_279> chillin with the squad on Broveria
[2:10:23] <Xxnanshankingladdyxx> de funni gun
[2:10:25] <%jillyrancher> I never cared about GoT tbh Queeqag. I'm just curious.
[2:10:27] <Dunmarkh> time to kill everything
[2:10:27] <+kewlmyc> Really only 5 party members in this game? And one was DLC?
[2:10:28] <tattleworm> GRAAL
[2:10:30] <%InternetShis> N7 mission, BRRRT time
[2:10:33] <%trackles_64> well yes

[2:10:37] <tanarath> YES
[2:10:37] <+Bob_Tom> itss just violent flechette rounds
[2:10:37] <%AmericanSkidd> it do
[2:10:38] <$lotharrio> Oh you know what/ Costner was good in the Untouchables and Bull Durham.
[2:10:38] <%ComfortableStranger> yes and its super fun
[2:10:39] <tattleworm> geth shotgun but knives
[2:10:39] <%ahomeschooldropout> ';'''''shotgun'''''''
[2:10:39] <%sunsetdisc0> of course it is. what else would a krogan use?
[2:10:40] <+unhuggable1> its more like a sniper
[2:10:41] <%xcompleasedad> Yes
[2:10:41] <%DrTomT18> you should try the N7 shotgun with the drum mag
[2:10:44] <PaperyHornet1013> WERE WHALERS ON THE MOON
[2:10:48] <alrobot2014> it's a fun gun
[2:10:49] <BurdRightsActivist> DAMAGE
[2:10:49] <+ALazo> Oh I loved that gun
[2:10:49] <stormhawk9891> Why not?
[2:10:53] <tanarath> You should
[2:10:54] <%jillyrancher> Typhon go BRRRRRRRRRRRRRRR
[2:10:56] <%InternetShis> Does this thing penetrate shields by default?
[2:10:56] <KeystoneA2> IIRC you can charge this shotgun up
[2:10:56] <%ComfortableStranger> has auto pen so don't use shredder
[2:10:56] <%HaroldDonchee> it almost looks like it's from a different game. love it
[2:10:56] <%shadowsofpain> why wouldn't it be
[2:10:57] <yourliteraldog> This gun has cool lore
[2:10:58] <digaogrunge> SURE
[2:11:03] <Aiutare47> I like the Graal a lot
[2:11:04] <perfectharbinger> It's a fun gun to use and actually fairly good.
[2:11:05] <%bassoontyphoon> Love the spoke thrower
[2:11:06] <DatAsuna> It's okay, but the kishook harpoon gun does the same gimmick better
[2:11:08] <%jillyrancher> it's a charge shotgun
[2:11:09] <$lotharrio> Good in Mr. Brooks, too.
[2:11:09] <%DrTomT18> Pat, I promise that you won't even notice
[2:11:10] <akitanito> big dps go dooooown
[2:11:10] <tanarath> 189%/200%
[2:11:12] <%AmericanSkidd> do whaat you want
[2:11:12] <yourliteraldog> It's designed to be a war crime
[2:11:13] <perfectharbinger> I don't know if it's as good as the Claymore.
[2:11:15] <%RealThiele> THIS IS AN ORK WEAPON
[2:11:15] <cpt_langosta> power > gun
[2:11:16] <+dd44dostivei> this game has too many guns
[2:11:16] <%zuzuxiv> BUT IT THROWS SPIKES
[2:11:17] <%InternetShis> Pat it has penetration
[2:11:18] <%shadowsofpain> sure if you dont like it you have Garrus to solo everything
[2:11:19] <Mattais88> Its one mission
[2:11:20] <PaperyHornet1013> WHALERS ON THE MOON PAT
[2:11:22] <Aiutare47> Barely.
[2:11:23] <Profmcstevie> You will not notice the microseconds
[2:11:24] <%cvp5127> BUT NUMBER
[2:11:26] <%jillyrancher> kishok is a sniper tho fuck that psaUp
[2:11:27] <%trackles_64> i mean its not like your on hard mode
[2:11:28] <akitanito> you'll still get killed by turrets anyway
[2:11:30] <+Resnus90> Garrus has calibrated my heart to love
[2:11:31] <%DrTomT18> Shockwave good
[2:11:37] <stormhawk9891> You're fine at above 170% recharge imo
[2:11:43] <@QueequegTheater> @kewlmyc 6, like the first game, plus DLC. Two show up later.  However, practically every pair has unique interactions in every mission
[2:11:45] <%DrTomT18> Carnage is great
[2:11:45] <yourliteraldog> Pat the Perpetrator
[2:11:49] <tanarath> Carnage

[2:12:00] <@QueequegTheater> Speed
[2:12:01] <%ComfortableStranger> @jillyrancher it has no hipfire penalty so you can use it without the scope
[2:12:05] <%jillyrancher> Pat Vs Turrets Round 5
[2:12:05] <%shadowsofpain> Carnage
[2:12:18] <DickieWoodsmall_279> paragon shep has micropenis energy
[2:12:25] <SaltyAzteca> Which mission is this?
[2:12:28] <@QueequegTheater> @PatStaresAt James is extremely good against turrets, maybe bring him more often Kappa

[2:12:50] <%akscully> noveria
[2:12:52] <KeystoneA2> Great map for Infiltrators in MP
[2:12:55] <perfectharbinger> Noveria
[2:12:57] <Sp3ctre48> Remember how they had to redesign this map because of how exploitable it was?
[2:12:59] <%xcompleasedad> NO
[2:13:00] <%SpcOpsBear> FEROS IS MUCH GRITTIER
[2:13:00] <KeystoneA2> Long ass sightlines
[2:13:01] <%DrTomT18> @jtdobyns They are

[2:13:05] <%peachy996> yeah sure it's the same
[2:13:05] <+hmgirlpopuri> Time to come back to the planet where Shepard shot a bunch of mall cops

[2:13:20] <%shadowsofpain> love
[2:13:20] <%RetroCop87> KERUBERUS
[2:13:24] <28moogles> I liked this map in multiplayer
[2:13:26] <SaltyAzteca> THAT MAN IS DEAD

[2:13:31] <PaperyHornet1013> HARPOON
[2:13:32] <%ComfortableStranger> old version of firebase white
[2:13:32] <%DrTomT18> This is used for hunting Threater Maws, Pat
[2:13:33] <%xcompleasedad> AH YEAH
[2:13:33] <%zuzuxiv> god the sound it makes
[2:13:35] <DickieWoodsmall_279> feros has atmopshere, the thing me1 fans desperately cling to, like dmc1 fans
[2:13:36] <+Bob_Tom> oh thats right this had a bunch of the multiplayer levels recycled into it
[2:13:37] <%SpcOpsBear> Small bits flake off of the spike as you shoot, so yes, it does!
[2:13:37] <$SGrim> Krogan weaponry
[2:13:38] <@QueequegTheater> Spike Thrower fucks
[2:13:39] <$lotharrio> Oh this was a fun MP map.
[2:13:40] <yourliteraldog> Oh wait this one I liked

[2:13:44] <%Monkeyweed21> its prounounced Kirby Ross
[2:13:45] <%jackelzxaa> hope you like having the half life crossbolt launcher as a shotgun pat
[2:13:45] <Dunmarkh> tight spread on this thing
[2:13:45] <BurdRightsActivist> SOUND DESIGN
[2:13:45] <+DracosMagala> Charge it
[2:13:47] <%walternatorz> This was my favorite map
[2:13:48] <%peachy996> Take Indendiary off. It'll bleed them instead of burn them
[2:13:48] <%SpcOpsBear> It's ~Frangible Ammunition~
[2:13:49] <%InternetShis> FATTEST THUNK
[2:13:52] <+unhuggable1> this is a really good MP map
[2:13:53] <%shadowsofpain> Legitimately one of the best MP maps before the earth expansion
[2:13:53] <%trackles_64> this map is such a pain on insanity
[2:13:56] <RLT917> KKona
[2:13:58] <%jillyrancher> ME1 fans....those poor things.
[2:14:01] <Sp3ctre48> This map was great but for a while it was just people farming Gold Geth because they couldn't walk through the table in the office
[2:14:02] <akitanito> we going whale huntin
[2:14:04] <alrobot2014> this is what krogan rednecks would use
[2:14:05] <yourliteraldog> IT SHOOTS CHOPPY DAKA
[2:14:06] <RrenKrieg> it's too much gun for pat's babby arms
[2:14:07] <%Romuken> that gun can be charged?!
[2:14:09] <%SpcOpsBear> god I hated doing this map on Gold difficulty or higher
[2:14:10] <+HanbaobaoZaiNar> Yesterday I shot a Thresher Maw in my pajamas, what a Thresher Maw was doing in my pajamas I'll never know!
[2:14:14] <SauceJockey> seeing someone play this game without reload cancelling is making my brain go AAAAAA
[2:14:15] <%jackelzxaa> one cool thing about the multiplayer was you could play as a salarian with pink and green armor
[2:14:16] <%jillyrancher> DAKKA DAKKA DAKKA
[2:14:16] <akitanito> you've got to aim
[2:14:19] <%jackelzxaa> pat you can charge teh shotgun
[2:14:19] <%DrTomT18> Rip pat
[2:14:19] <%RealThiele> DAKKA launcher
[2:14:21] <akitanito> wow.
[2:14:21] <@QueequegTheater> LUL
[2:14:23] <$lotharrio> Aiming? No thank you.
[2:14:24] <cpt_langosta> but how can it be
[2:14:25] <@QueequegTheater> Kappa
[2:14:26] <+DracosMagala> LUL
[2:14:27] <%AmericanSkidd> pog

[2:14:29] <%shadowsofpain> Dude that sounds like liquid sex oh my good that sound is amazing
[2:14:31] <%Ravioli_Ronin> psaWrong
[2:14:32] <%walternatorz> did you like their guns? you sure got used to them
[2:14:33] <%peachy996> maybe use the gun like a smart person?
[2:14:33] <Sp3ctre48> This is the graal experience tbh
[2:14:34] <Goatllama> LUL
[2:14:36] <%jackelzxaa> your ammo power is off pat
[2:14:36] <yourliteraldog> I thought the spike thrower can be charged
[2:14:36] <BurdRightsActivist> IMAGINE AIMING
[2:14:38] <+unhuggable1> that gun is better as a backup
[2:14:39] <%peachy996> just a thought
[2:14:40] <%FaderPotater> maybe taking the spread off a shotgun was a bad idea for pat.
[2:14:41] <perfectharbinger> I think the problem with the gun is the guy holding it lol.
[2:14:41] <@commanderclaw> Pat wants to unga bunga
[2:14:42] <%Retinolgaming> You can hold it down to charge the gun I think? @PatStaresAt
[2:14:46] <%Axellogic> Hey its the map where 90% of multiplayer happens
[2:14:47] <robosqueeb> Is the game over music saryns theme?
[2:14:47] <%RetroCop87> Pat: All assist, no aim
[2:14:49] <RrenKrieg> this is the most unga bunga gameplay
[2:14:53] <%ComfortableStranger> charged shot the reg shot
[2:14:54] <%LumberjackJack> "I don't wanna play the shooting gaaaaaaaame"
[2:14:59] <%jackelzxaa> if you put grenades on as the dpad power for james you can mash it with no cooldown
[2:15:00] <TioXyco> @Retinolgaming the geth shotgun yes, this one I dunno
[2:15:01] <%Ravioli_Ronin> No aim, only face fuck
[2:15:02] <DSD24> Its a good map
[2:15:02] <%LumberjackJack> For grinding, yup. Easy to cheese
[2:15:04] <%peachy996> 70% I'd say
[2:15:04] <QuestlordJake> the sound of it is massive
[2:15:06] <perfectharbinger> @robosqueeb It's Saren's theme, yeah. Has been for the trilogy.
[2:15:06] <@QueequegTheater> Pat wants a rail shooter with VN gameplay
[2:15:08] <%ItsYaGirlMaria> oh yeah this map is the grinding map
[2:15:09] <%SpcOpsBear> thank you for making fun of my playstyle pat, please kindly f--- yourself
[2:15:09] <28moogles> The maps were all even for me?\
[2:15:11] <%jackelzxaa> it clicks
[2:15:12] <%ComfortableStranger> @Axellogic not true, it was durring the first month maybe
[2:15:13] <+Bob_Tom> the clackity
[2:15:15] <%jackelzxaa> theres a slight click
[2:15:15] <tattleworm> it makes that noise
[2:15:18] <alrobot2014> you hear the sizzle
[2:15:18] <+unhuggable1> the sound
[2:15:19] <DickieWoodsmall_279> actually our memories is where 100% of the multiplayer happens
[2:15:22] <%ItsYaGirlMaria> there are certain waist high cover that were the best
[2:15:22] <DSD24> Man Shepard looks soo good with this helmet
[2:15:28] <%jillyrancher> TAKING CASUALTIES
[2:15:28] <yourliteraldog> clackity clak
[2:15:31] <RrenKrieg> it's made by a krogan what did you expect?
[2:15:32] <akitanito> sounds like a kettle
[2:15:34] <Aiutare47> Popular MP map, I loved the snowstorm  variant
[2:15:38] <%bassoontyphoon> Clacking
[2:15:39] <%shadowsofpain> that clicky sound
[2:15:40] <DatAsuna> Nah it's just one of the worse MP maps but the labs and the acid rain map were the majority of it for me
[2:15:42] <%DrTomT18> Pat, you'd like the Pirhanna shot gun
[2:15:43] <Sp3ctre48> You can tell some shotguns are clearly more made for Infiltrators than Vanguards LUL
[2:15:50] <%Ravioli_Ronin> Clicking clack I’m here to attack hasPause
[2:15:51] <+jojo_abob> Pat is using pulll????
[2:15:51] <RrenKrieg> try the n7 crusader
[2:15:53] <%jackelzxaa> pat if you don't like aiming, have you tried the adas assault rifle?  It's the big quarian bazooka thing.  it's just the needler from halo but as a bazooka
[2:15:56] <%DrTomT18> test out the shot guns in the shooting range, Pat
[2:16:01] <%peachy996> It's a gun thats fun to use once or twice
[2:16:02] <SaltyAzteca> Je ne sais quoi
[2:16:04] <%RealThiele> A B C
[2:16:04] <%Monkeyweed21> you mean the Wraith
[2:16:07] <yourliteraldog> It gets the point across that the gun is super dangerous for everyone
[2:16:08] <dekkitout> Is that french for it dont hit right? SeriousSloth
[2:16:11] <@QueequegTheater> Junnasaykwah?
[2:16:15] <SalvoFatts> Pat will hate the crusader
[2:16:16] <%LumberjackJack> Oh! Have you tried the claymore yet? Longer recharge times, but the POWER
[2:16:16] <perfectharbinger> There's an item in this room.
[2:16:19] <DickieWoodsmall_279> you need extra big nuts for the gun
[2:16:19] <tattleworm> pat just said he doesn't want to aim, don't recommend the crusader lol
[2:16:21] <%shadowsofpain> It's a good for a different type of class
[2:16:22] <%ComfortableStranger> @RrenKrieg the delay on the fire kinda sucks
[2:16:25] <RrenKrieg> the n7 crusader was the only gun i used for the my vanguard playthrough
[2:16:25] <BurdRightsActivist> JENsetsayqueh
[2:16:26] <perfectharbinger> On the other wall, there's a screen.
[2:16:28] <@QueequegTheater> James

[2:16:33] <%DrTomT18> ask the meat head
[2:16:36] <%Monkeyweed21> JAMES
[2:16:36] <DSD24> James is hackerman
[2:16:38] <%bassoontyphoon> Je ne sais quoin in Québécois
[2:16:40] <cpt_langosta> james has never seen a computer
[2:16:41] <%peachy996> This MP map isn't bad. the white out can be annoying though
[2:16:41] <ThatGuyThere03> You let James touch a computer
[2:16:43] <ThatGuyThere03> you fool
[2:16:45] <Madinki> J A M E S
[2:16:47] <%RealThiele> HACK WITH MEAT HANDS
[2:16:50] <@goose_attack_almanac> MM TRUE, Crusader is a railgun in shotgun form
[2:16:50] <KeystoneA2> It's in the other hallway
[2:16:52] <%jillyrancher> James punches the computer
[2:16:53] <%DrTomT18> you can just buy it afterwards
[2:16:55] <AngryAsian5> James will just punch the computer into doing what he wants
[2:16:57] <%Alig200> up on the wall, theres a monitor, right behind where that datapad was
[2:16:59] <@QueequegTheater> @PatStaresAt There's a mission where if you send James to hack a computer he just starts kicking it
[2:17:00] <%jackelzxaa> james is good at compxuters
[2:17:04] <dekkitout> I'll have you know Jimmy is a+ certified
[2:17:05] <perfectharbinger> It's a screen on the wall. By the desk.
[2:17:06] <%sunsetdisc0> it's on a monitor cloer to the ceiling
[2:17:08] <%maenos2> James is best hacker, just wait
[2:17:12] <cpt_langosta> his best
[2:17:15] <%ComfortableStranger> honestly the pirhana would best fit Pat's playstyle
[2:17:16] <%jackelzxaa> it's funny how james punching a computer is just as good as a master hacker like tali
[2:17:19] <Sp3ctre48> Camping the table on firebase White, this is so nostalgic BibleThump
[2:17:19] <Aiutare47> Actually, has pat tried the Crusader, or did he dismiss it as too heavy without testing it?
[2:17:20] <%jillyrancher> pat will probably love the AT-12 Raider
[2:17:21] <%DrTomT18> he flew away
[2:17:21] <DatAsuna> @QueequegTheater can't that wait until he gets there?
[2:17:22] <%LumberjackJack> He was looking at your sweet gam-gams

[2:20:25] <@goose_attack_almanac> The Graal Spiker thrower is unique in that it applies a DoT bleed effect. Since the intention of the gun is to kill Thresher Maws from the inside, much like a Dragoons armour

[2:25:55] <%kyh9> This game feels like just a million fun little shitposts from the Mass Effect characters
[2:25:56] <murdocismyhero> Bourbon is amazing
[2:25:57] <%RetroCop87> do you think her cheekbones detach from her head like a drone?
[2:25:57] <count1999> WHY IS SHE THERE
[2:25:58] <+senfood> Bourbon rules. And it can, sometimes, even be better than Scotch.

[2:27:50] <%JamesCorck> Pat, I recommend you take a break here.
[2:27:52] <%Treasure_Vault> Why is it "throw" out the airlock? It's not really throwing cause you gotta throw them into the airlock, lock the airlock, then space them
[2:27:53] <%Meekest> Im sure nothing will happen
[2:27:54] <LeiaSkynoober> Joker gets a pass, Ashley doesn't
[2:27:54] <%Mr___Pillow> was reading a lot of cut content audio files be in the Leg Edition, so modders will be able add it in eventually and easier due to a better audio engine or something

[2:35:14] <%xcompleasedad> Remember 30 minutes ago......
[2:35:17] <perfectharbinger> Fucking Cerberus.
[2:35:17] <%captain_kirkhammer> Welcome to the beginning of the famed ME3 writing
[2:35:18] <%Mr_Pylon> how many fucking guys does Cerberus have?!?!
[2:35:20] <DatAsuna> This sequence actually had to be rewritten from an earlier draft where the motive was completely different
[2:35:22] <%peachy996> This is when the game gets stupid and gets dumber from there
[2:35:29] <%machshop> thane!
[2:35:29] <ZilverZap> kmaShake  choke him out
[2:35:32] <+D00msDayDan> oh boy it's time for that thing
[2:35:33] <%Ravioli_Ronin> hasPOGGIES hasPOGGIES hasPOGGIES
[2:35:34] <%count_bob> Pat, there is a gun you can miss permanently in this mission. Be careful.
[2:35:34] <%jackelzxaa> i like taking edi on this one.  if you take garrus theres a REALLY bad face animation he makes at one point
[2:35:39] <%cooldude69xx> And the turian/asari fleets are where?
[2:35:41] <$lotharrio> Oh gee, you think it's important, Joker?
[2:35:45] <%cvp5127> protect his nips
[2:35:47] <%trackles_64> Cant wait for Citadel DLC
[2:35:47] <Alzero83> Kaidans Nipples will not save us
[2:35:52] <%machshop> oh yeah it's time for this fuckin guy
[2:36:00] <%Ravioli_Ronin> Kaiden hasBuff hasBuff hasBuff hasBuff
[2:36:00] <%RetroCop87> huh. Thane sounds kind of like Odo
[2:36:01] <perfectharbinger> So fun fact: If Thane is dead, this is Kirrahe and not Thane.
[2:36:01] <RrenKrieg> sleeper cells
[2:36:02] <dekkitout> Because.
[2:36:02] <+SilverDevilfish> Plot
[2:36:02] <AluxStreams> A big-ass army and the Ilos relay I guess?
[2:36:03] <%LumberjackJack> This is not one of the good missions
[2:36:03] <CosmicApe13> Time to fuck up some Alien Racists
[2:36:04] <blackjack8182> This sequence went through a last minute rewrites.
[2:36:04] <ape_hawk> M O N E Y
[2:36:04] <Sp3ctre48> don't worry about it
[2:36:05] <%SpcOpsBear> because reapers
[2:36:05] <%AmericanSkidd> how in the goddamn did cerberus get so many dudes to transform into soldiers
[2:36:06] <@QueequegTheater> Shut up tho Kappa
[2:36:07] <%Treasure_Vault> Inside man?
[2:36:08] <%cooldude69xx> How did they get through?
[2:36:09] <%xcompleasedad> You will LEARN
[2:36:09] <+beansoup> hmm i wonder pat
[2:36:10] <DSD24> Oh boy is it
[2:36:10] <%peachy996> Oh also the most annoying enemy. You thought Turrets were annoying?
[2:36:11] <%hatok> there is  a reaper invasion happening
[2:36:11] <SaltyAzteca> Udina maybe?
[2:36:12] <%rkbinder> USE WARP
[2:36:13] <%akscully> yep
[2:36:13] <%ahomeschooldropout> ONLY A 150 AGENTS AT THE END OF ME2
[2:36:13] <%Mr_Pylon> Didn't they have like a couple hundred dudes in ME2?
[2:36:14] <%Piemono> Best character in ME 3 coming up
[2:36:16] <CosmicApe13> Xenophobes?
[2:36:17] <%JamesCorck> Wait, what's that over there? Is that the script?
[2:36:17] <%kyh9> Cerberus is basically its own nation at this point
[2:36:19] <DickieWoodsmall_279> they just walked in you do it all the time
[2:36:20] <Aiutare47> This is where you can miss the Talon pistol right?
[2:36:21] <+senfood> I'm guessing they did is clandestinely.
[2:36:21] <$lotharrio> Because lies and money.
[2:36:22] <%LumberjackJack> This mission basically replaced the cut Palaven level
[2:36:22] <%Treasure_Vault> Kung fu action
[2:36:24] <%machshop> @perfectharbinger what if they're both dead?
[2:36:24] <terrible35> War Crimes, thats how
[2:36:26] <zerointelligence000> It's kinda dumb how the citadel gets taken over twice in a pretty small timeframe
[2:36:26] <RrenKrieg> it's a slug shotgun
[2:36:26] <%kyh9> Indoctrination?
[2:36:27] <+ThomasOfTroy> A few thousand well trained troops would be MORE than enough, and they probably have more
[2:36:28] <%cooldude69xx> Crusader is doep
[2:36:29] <%DrTomT18> the other one
[2:36:29] <%Ravioli_Ronin> Yeah didn’t they say Cerberus was very small in 2?
[2:36:31] <Tracazoid> "We'll send wave after wave of our own men if we have to"- Illusive Man
[2:36:32] <RrenKrieg> it's basically a shotgun sniper rifle
[2:36:32] <Sp3ctre48> I remember the Crusader being good
[2:36:32] <knight_verse> What paer of black ops group do people not understand?
[2:36:33] <%jackelzxaa> the quarian assault rifle is great and you dont have to aim it
[2:36:33] <DSD24> Crusader is pretty good but you want a pistol along with it
[2:36:34] <DatAsuna> It's very similar to the eviscerator yeah
[2:36:34] <%captain_kirkhammer> because it's good
[2:36:35] <SalvoFatts> Slug lyfe
[2:36:36] <%DrTomT18> the one with the drum mag
[2:36:36] <DXLelouch24> IM has ALOT of money
[2:36:36] <stormhawk9891> @PatStaresAt It's a slug Shotgun
[2:36:37] <legion0047> they answer that question
[2:36:37] <%jackelzxaa> its called adas i think
[2:36:38] <@goose_attack_almanac> Crusader has no spread. It's a point and kill
[2:36:39] <dekkitout> It had a heavy lunch?
[2:36:40] <%cooldude69xx> Its pinpoint accurate
[2:36:40] <knight_verse> *part
[2:36:40] <CosmicApe13> Cause it's a big boi
[2:36:41] <%valriot> Cos its BIG gun
[2:36:43] <Aiutare47> It’s a single huge slug
[2:36:43] <+unhuggable1> is that street sweeper one good?
[2:36:44] <blackjack8182> It’s good
[2:36:44] <%jackelzxaa> venom is unreal
[2:36:45] <%kyh9> Spike Thrower will get you cancelled just by holding it
[2:36:45] <%captain_kirkhammer> the pirhana
[2:36:46] <%LumberjackJack> Crusader has slug rounds, Pat would have to aim and he hates aiming
[2:36:50] <%DrTomT18> over one
[2:36:52] <DatAsuna> I like the piranha but that's more of a hip fire type
[2:36:52] <%kyh9> VENOM
[2:36:52] <%jackelzxaa> venom is a grenade launcher
[2:36:53] <RrenKrieg> it's a matter of preference
[2:36:55] <%kyh9> VENOM YEAH
[2:36:55] <perfectharbinger> The Crusader is more of a sniper shotgun lol.
[2:36:56] <%jackelzxaa> with cluster bombs
[2:36:57] <tommytyre> pirhanna
[2:36:57] <%DrTomT18> the Pirhannah
[2:36:59] <akitanito> but slugs means pat needs to aim
[2:36:59] <RrenKrieg> the claymore is also a good choice
[2:37:00] <%DrTomT18> or whatever its called
[2:37:01] <%jillyrancher> @patstaresat Most of Cerberus resources and manpower comes from Omega I think.
[2:37:07] <@QueequegTheater> Just stay with the Krogan Boomstick
[2:37:07] <+Bail_Seven> love you claymore
[2:37:10] <chainsaw105> slug shotgun? we doing Taniks DPS?
[2:37:14] <+TrevSmith222> Even though it's a pistol, the Talon is a great shotgun.
[2:37:17] <%jillyrancher> and another thing that spoilers.
[2:37:17] <%trackles_64> Saren took over the citadel with just a few geth
[2:37:17] <+unhuggable1> evisc
[2:37:18] <RrenKrieg> ammo cap vs damage
[2:37:19] <QuestlordJake> slug mean aimed shots nonono
[2:37:22] <@QueequegTheater> The claymore is basically if sex was a gun
[2:37:27] <%AmericanSkidd> its just better
[2:37:32] <%DrTomT18> Read the Wraiths lore!
[2:37:36] <%DrTomT18> press Y!
[2:37:40] <perfectharbinger> Yeah, the Wraith is better.
[2:37:41] <RrenKrieg> @TrevSmith222 talon is good, just doesn't have too much stopping power
[2:37:46] <cpt_langosta> SHE BEAT ME TO IT
[2:37:48] <@QueequegTheater> She can turn it on?
[2:37:51] <%trackles_64> ELMO
[2:37:58] <%DrTomT18> FUCK YEAH
[2:38:03] <%DrTomT18> I knew you'd like that!
[2:38:04] <%strakillias> CAT
[2:38:06] <DatAsuna> Paige? Remembering things?
[2:38:06] <studleydoorite> omg it was a cat talking that whole time?
[2:38:07] <%JamesCorck> Hey Paige!
[2:38:07] <$lotharrio> Disintegrators
[2:38:10] <%AmericanSkidd> fuck yeah war crimes
[2:38:11] <+senfood> WHO'S TALKING
[2:38:11] <%cvp5127> but the adderall
[2:38:12] <PunchSlugfest> The gangs all here
[2:38:12] <yourliteraldog> Illegal weapons
[2:38:13] <RedPlasticCup> elmooooooo
[2:38:17] <Explodincatz> wah wah
[2:38:17] <akitanito> big war crimes
[2:38:22] <%cooldude69xx> @TrevSmith222 The talon is my second favorite shotgun in ME
[2:38:23] <cpt_langosta> like prothean prolapse procreation
[2:38:25] <%bassoontyphoon> WHO SAID THAT???!?
[2:38:27] <KeystoneA2> A lot of the Batarian/Krogan guns are banned in Citadel Space
[2:38:28] <%captain_kirkhammer> Fucking Varon T Disruptor from the one episode of Next Gen
[2:38:29] <%megadblitz> illegal space guns
[2:38:29] <$lotharrio> 2hot4citadel
[2:38:32] <+TrevSmith222> @TrevSmith222 True.  I've always really enjoyed it for headshots.
[2:38:33] <alrobot2014> how many of these weapons are even allowed on the citadel
[2:38:33] <%peachy996> Aw ye here we go
[2:38:41] <%DrTomT18> The Claymore was also banned in Mass Effect 2 because anyone but a Krogen would break their arms when they fried it.
[2:38:45] <RrenKrieg> corruption
[2:38:48] <%cooldude69xx> THEY SNUCK IN PAT
[2:38:49] <@QueequegTheater> Don't think about it
[2:38:51] <%Reveresao> Gonna ask Bioware
[2:38:51] <%twistedj3ster> why does this scene look like shit
[2:38:52] <%peachy996> time for the story to come tumbling down, tumbling down, tumbling down
[2:38:53] <cpt_langosta> what happened to the framerate all of a sudden?
[2:38:54] <DatAsuna> ceberus gets absurd level ups in between every game
[2:38:54] <%ahomeschooldropout> Only a hundred and fifty by the end of ME3 remember that
[2:38:54] <%Treasure_Vault> Mass Effect fields
[2:38:56] <Psyramics> thats how you play Tank in L4D2
[2:38:57] <%Romuken> I blame Udina.
[2:39:01] <DickieWoodsmall_279> it's all just about the politics man
[2:39:01] <AngryAsian5> Shhhhhh
[2:39:01] <%HaroldDonchee> bro that was our cover
[2:39:05] <%machshop> they're all really big fans of Martin Sheen
[2:39:06] <%jillyrancher> Tbh I always assumed the Citadel attack was something like Tet Offensive. Cerberus had been slowly moving weapons and agents onto the Citadel and attacked now.
[2:39:08] <+ThomasOfTroy> There's a refugee crisis they can exploit, for one
[2:39:09] <KeystoneA2> An office in C-Sec HQ
[2:39:14] <%CollinsOfBodom> sleeper cells?
[2:39:16] <%DrTomT18> we will help you find it don't worry
[2:39:17] <%cooldude69xx> Its not hard to find, you find it next to an elevator
[2:39:18] <$hattrick61> In the Bathroom
[2:39:26] <%LumberjackJack> If I recall, this mission replaces the cut Palaven level due to short development time. Easier to reuse assets than to make a whole new planet
[2:39:28] <%ComfortableStranger> the revenant and the hornet
[2:39:30] <%Ravioli_Ronin> So many jabronis
[2:39:33] <Sp3ctre48> wow C-Sec sucks
[2:39:34] <%ComfortableStranger> 2 weapons
[2:39:35] <akitanito> OH NO A TURRET
[2:39:37] <%strakillias> AMMO
[2:39:37] <cpt_langosta> pat loves all cops, confirmed
[2:39:48] <%Alig200> @jillyrancher I think thats pretty much how it went down tbh. Moved arms and armor in overtime, and then had sleeper agents make the first strike.
[2:39:51] <%akscully> warp ammo
[2:39:51] <%AmericanSkidd> they are shooting garrus's old cop buddies
[2:39:52] <@QueequegTheater> Pat LOVES cops
[2:39:54] <%maenos2> that's a lot of wards
[2:39:55] <Deoxplosion> Huh it didn't shoot
[2:39:56] <%ComfortableStranger> reventant sucks, hornet is decent
[2:39:57] <%RetroCop87> Pat's eternal rival
[2:40:02] <RrenKrieg> @Sp3ctre48 i mean, they're cops, they aren't armed and trained to fight fully trained armies
[2:40:02] <QuestlordJake> they're currently getting got
[2:40:11] <PaperyHornet1013> Pat will never change or aim
[2:40:11] <%DrTomT18> shes a mage what do you expect
[2:40:11] <28moogles> Oh no, I think you are going to have the glitched eyes with that helmet when the game forces it off.
[2:40:11] <dekkitout> Like a lawn chair in the wind
[2:40:13] <DickieWoodsmall_279> I blame the aliens for this, get them out, terra firma rise up, make humanity great again, fuck the council
[2:40:16] <perfectharbinger> I really like the music in this level.
[2:40:21] <scrumbotime> a turret is just a toilet that can shoot
[2:40:22] <$hattrick61> Too tophesvy
[2:40:22] <+GuilKato> shes top heavy from the boobs
[2:40:24] <%jillyrancher> @alig200 Theres a data pad that mentions how Csec is finding Talons smuggled on the station
[2:40:27] <CosmicApe13> I thought Liara was the Shadow Broker in ME2
[2:40:28] <%LumberjackJack> EMLO
[2:40:29] <$hattrick61> Bloobies
[2:40:29] <Profmcstevie> Shadowbroker is getting deets on the floor
[2:40:32] <%cooldude69xx> @jillyrancher Okay, but where are the space defenses?
[2:40:36] <alrobot2014> grandpa made a cameo for 2 seconds
[2:40:38] <DSD24> @CosmicApe13 She still is

[2:43:52] <Kat_k> cant wait for those romance scenes
[2:43:53] <Goatllama> O-O-O
[2:43:55] <CosmicApe13> BULGING EYE SYNDROME
[2:43:55] <BigFingerRo> PUT ON SOME GOOOGELEY EYES!
[2:43:55] <%jillyrancher> it would ruin some genuinely good scenes tho
[2:44:01] <heartlesshealer> hmmm
[2:44:01] <%FaderPotater> this is an episode of monster factory now.
[2:44:02] <+thatotherblackson> Shepard my eyes are up here
[2:44:04] <supergoblinpunch> I can't, I'm fucking crying
[2:44:05] <zerointelligence000> Shepat's perception increased 10-fold

[2:44:07] <%DrTomT18> it is a pretty good gun
[2:44:08] <%megadblitz> keep it, keep it until the final climactic cutscene
[2:44:08] <robosqueeb> @commanderclaw total bedroom eyes
[2:44:09] <%ahomeschooldropout> :eye: :lips: :eye:
[2:44:11] <28moogles> There's really good moments in here.
[2:44:13] <%JoshManVGH> You know Shepard is really listening when he exposes the entire eyeball
[2:44:13] <perfectharbinger> Yeah, it's gonna ruin a lot of scenes for you.
[2:44:13] <+vaderxyz1970> Tali romance scene going to be intense
[2:44:14] <%shadowsofpain> Did he miss the gun yet?
[2:44:17] <%DrTomT18> I don't like only having two shots though
[2:44:21] <blackjack8182> Save and reload
[2:44:23] <RrenKrieg> technically IT IS the eviscerator, just overclocked to shit
[2:44:23] <%maenos2> @faderpotater PAT"TRUCK" SHEPARD
[2:44:24] <GetGianni> don't worry it's mass effect the scenes are already stupid Kappa
[2:44:26] <%akscully> rival almost got ya
[2:44:27] <%captain_kirkhammer> @jillyrancher he's past the event horizon, there are no good scenes left
[2:44:28] <%NopeBadguy> This IS the ME1 C-Sec Area
[2:44:31] <%kekkerscrew> Two shots are all you need
[2:44:34] <@Spydurman> eventually you'll replace it with the Grab Maw
[2:44:35] <heartlesshealer> just get fucking shredded
[2:44:39] <%chill_o_wisp> SHIT THAT GUY EXPLODED
[2:44:39] <CosmicApe13> vaporized
[2:44:40] <28moogles> Either reload or turn off the helmet off option
[2:44:41] <akitanito> pffft
[2:44:42] <%HaroldDonchee> did that guy just liquify
[2:44:50] <TheMostAverageGamer4> looks familiar
[2:44:53] <%jackelzxaa> if you wait until your red bar starts to regen before you use medigel then you get a full heal of all 5 bars
[2:44:53] <@QueequegTheater> Because you have anxiety from chat and YT comments constantly screaming that you're wrong all the time and even inventing a Stand to explain always being wrong
[2:44:58] <%xcompleasedad> @Spydurman What about the Geth Shotty?
[2:45:01] <perfectharbinger> Look around this room for lore stuff.
[2:45:02] <%DrTomT18> imagine being hit so hard that there isn't even dust left of you
[2:45:09] <%count_bob> Computer.
[2:45:25] <$lotharrio> Lore trash
[2:45:26] <@Spydurman> @xcompleasedad I was trying to lure him into a Grab Maw nuts joke LUL
[2:45:27] <%LumberjackJack> Yeeeeeeeeeeaaaaaaaaaah, the mission is one of those earlier examples of the devs being rushed
[2:45:27] <arkv01> a canadian trashcan
[2:45:27] <Sp3ctre48> Not even a space trashcan
[2:45:28] <studleydoorite> I've seen it too, it's right there
[2:45:28] <%DrTomT18> they have stolen a lot of people to recruit
[2:45:29] <+SilverDevilfish> That looks just like my waste can
[2:45:30] <+bubblebasspickles> its a SPACE trashcan
[2:45:30] <Goatllama> perfect trash can shape was achieved early
[2:45:33] <DatAsuna> You can guess the reason right now probably
[2:45:35] <GetGianni> Humanity perfected the trashcan by like 2010. The universe acknowledges this.
[2:45:37] <AngryAsian5> HARDCORE
[2:45:37] <%CubicPhantom> i mean logistically they couldn't have pulled this off. it's not strong writing
[2:45:39] <heartlesshealer> had wheels
[2:45:41] <digaogrunge> They just lived on the citadel?
[2:45:41] <Blank9> it's a mimic
[2:45:45] <solidgoldtoast> No Pat, thats actually a Turian Trashcan
[2:45:46] <%shadowsofpain> if it ain't broke don't fix it
[2:45:46] <%JoshManVGH> I bet there is something here about "sneaking in with refuges."
[2:45:47] <+the_Punktuation> Not just Udina, largely offscreen conspiracy.
[2:45:48] <%Monkeyweed21> easy to sneak people in when millions of refugees coming in
[2:45:55] <RrenKrieg> and udina asked for all of them
[2:45:57] <%Deft_Thought> Fuck the cops though
[2:45:57] <perfectharbinger> Humans, yeah.
[2:45:57] <%AmericanSkidd> oh okay, that forgives it a little
[2:45:58] <AluxStreams> In ME2 you see Anderson talking to a dude from Cerberus on the Presidium.
[2:45:59] <akitanito> but all cerberus? really?
[2:46:01] <+ThomasOfTroy> They also could have literally just docked a single ship and flooded the docks, even without sleepers
[2:46:02] <@QueequegTheater> Also the refugee crisis
[2:46:02] <%Deft_Thought> Especially space cops
[2:46:02] <heartlesshealer> BABY <3
[2:46:03] <%ItsYaGirlMaria> yo thats pretty good
[2:46:05] <%Treasure_Vault> Can't trust humans
[2:46:07] <CosmicApe13> Human on Human Violence
[2:46:08] <%xcompleasedad> Chat, where is the nice gun?
[2:46:09] <%JamesCorck> they infiltrated C-Sec like Hydra infiltrated SHIELD.
[2:46:12] <%afronooch> 1312 even in space
[2:46:13] <yourliteraldog> I mean the terminals look like atms
[2:46:14] <%JamesCorck> Tons of sleeper agents.
[2:46:18] <%DrTomT18> probably not that many but yeah
[2:46:20] <yourliteraldog> Fucking humies
[2:46:30] <DickieWoodsmall_279> honestly it's the aliens fault
[2:46:32] <cpt_langosta> kill this cerberus scum. they know nothing of shepard's BRAND
[2:46:32] <DatAsuna> That's not the reason for the numbers but it is part of how they attack the citadel yes
[2:46:34] <Goatllama> they infiltrated c-sec like a god damn FIDDLE
[2:46:34] <%Ravioli_Ronin> Idk this is just normal cop behavior
[2:46:36] <Sp3ctre48> hundreds of sleeper agents apparently
[2:46:38] <%kyh9> Hmm, IDeological extremists infiltrating law enforcement, I wonder if that has any bearing on real life?
[2:46:39] <RrenKrieg> FAHKEN UMIES
[2:46:39] <solidgoldtoast> Humans bad
[2:46:50] <%JamesCorck> It just works.
[2:46:51] <%peachy996> But you are the Aliens now
[2:46:52] <SaltyAzteca> What about that one gun thats missable? Did he find it?
[2:46:52] <$lotharrio> Stupid humans, there's enough space waifu for us to all get a share.
[2:46:53] <+unhuggable1> i like it
[2:46:53] <%LumberjackJack> But then how did they get the military hardware and mechs? It'd be better if it was a Winter Soldier scenario and they all looked the same
[2:46:53] <@QueequegTheater> Yeah but it still looks cool
[2:46:54] <@Spydurman> wow that's great
[2:46:56] <%maenos2> downcoming
[2:46:57] <DatAsuna> this is actually way better than most UE3 games
[2:46:58] <zerointelligence000> So even space cops are filled with space racists?
[2:47:00] <%SovPho> because it's smart
[2:47:01] <%barrakuta371> I see it
[2:47:02] <akitanito> ingenious
[2:47:02] <%AmericanSkidd> it looks pretty good
[2:47:03] <%kyh9> For what it's worth, I think it looks good
[2:47:04] <@QueequegTheater> Still a cool effect
[2:47:04] <yourliteraldog> You can hide alot if you got some dirty cops on the take
[2:47:04] <RrenKrieg> that's actually pretty smart
[2:47:05] <%SovPho> like who would ever look at it that hard lol
[2:47:05] <%Tman451> look at it with your special eyes
[2:47:06] <+unhuggable1> fake chromatic abberation
[2:47:06] <SpaceManHotepIV> no stop looking at it
[2:47:07] <+Essixian> @kyh9 Nah nah, couldn't be
[2:47:08] <%MidnightBurst12> looks like 3
[2:47:08] <%barrakuta371> I see with my special eyes
[2:47:09] <Dabrikishaw> Interesting
[2:47:10] <Explodincatz> yup
[2:47:12] <%chill_o_wisp> pretty smart honestly
[2:47:15] <perfectharbinger> I really like that, honestly.

[2:47:51] <+Essixian> @notsoy I mean to be fair these are human supremacist terrorists, not cops
[2:47:53] <studleydoorite> @cpt_langosta never have to do laundry
[2:47:53] <%xcompleasedad> Isn't that the best AR????
[2:47:53] <+ThomasOfTroy> @cpt_langosta It's the future, all clothing is holographic
[2:47:56] <DSD24> Recon Hood is really cool
[2:47:56] <digaogrunge> yeyeyeye
[2:47:58] <perfectharbinger> Yup.
[2:48:03] <$hattrick61> MORE DAKKKKA
[2:48:03] <Aiutare47> Gun 1/2 acquired
[2:48:04] <RrenKrieg> it's majorly shit in me3
[2:48:05] <%LumberjackJack> Yup. It's still good for companions in ME3 if you don't have the typhoon
[2:48:07] <%shadowsofpain> Dakka dakka
[2:48:11] <notsoy> as if there aren't white supremacists everywhere in modern police?
[2:48:12] <Alzero83> I miss the CAIN
[2:48:12] <RrenKrieg> the typhoon has eclipsed it in me3
[2:48:13] <$lotharrio> John Mass Effect 2 is my favorite game charcter.
[2:48:15] <GustauveVIII> missed the medkit in the last room
[2:48:17] <perfectharbinger> Yeah, Death Mask and Recon Hood both cause the glitch.
[2:48:19] <KeystoneA2> Not as good as it was in ME2. Also there's an armor piece in that sprinkler room
[2:48:26] <SaltyAzteca> It was in the bathroom, hah
[2:48:34] <%peachy996> the typhoon is big pp version of Revenant
[2:48:35] <RrenKrieg> it's very heavyt
[2:48:40] <%trackles_64> Beefy boi
[2:48:41] <DickieWoodsmall_279> just like bastion
[2:48:42] <@QueequegTheater> It's also great though
[2:48:44] <%DrTomT18> not for Vanguards
[2:48:45] <%ahomeschooldropout> Yea the eyeball glitch happens if you have that headgear on when you disabled helmets in cutscenes. Super funny in Citadel
[2:48:49] <yourliteraldog> It's legit problem extremist in police.
[2:48:55] <%count_bob> Flame ammo.
[2:48:56] <%LumberjackJack> Quick! Talk about your mother!
[2:48:58] <%Mr___Pillow> GameFAQ's Post "Cerberus gets contributions from outside sources, including the Alliance itself.  Primarily, though, Cerberus owns a whole crapload of fronts, from charities to weapons manufacturers, as its primary source of income." Wouldn't far fetched some people in Cerebus be C-SEC, Alliance, and from these shady billiion dollar companies
[2:48:58] <cpt_langosta> where's carl
[2:49:01] <%xcompleasedad> @QueequegTheater Is the Typhoon better?
[2:49:01] <%shadowsofpain> yeah it's a lmg
[2:49:04] <$lotharrio> Garrus tell me the entire history of your species, quick!
[2:49:05] <SaltyAzteca> its not the same :(
[2:49:06] <%trackles_64> C sec got owned
[2:49:08] <DatAsuna> Don't say it
[2:49:08] <$hattrick61> Before anyone gets excited missed items become available in the store
[2:49:10] <@QueequegTheater> @xcompleasedad I barely remember
[2:49:11] <%xcompleasedad> @QueequegTheater Never fucked with the heavy AR's
[2:49:14] <%AmericanSkidd> garrus is like, all my friends are dead lol
[2:49:18] <KeystoneA2> It's similar
[2:49:19] <%DrTomT18> Alright pat this is where the gun is hidden
[2:49:20] <+Essixian> @yourliteraldog Yup, fascists love infiltrating law enforcement
[2:49:22] <RrenKrieg> yeyeyeye

[2:49:48] <RrenKrieg> TALON TALON TALON
[2:49:53] <Aiutare47> Is the Talon in here?
[2:49:54] <+ThomasOfTroy> no
[2:49:54] <scrumbotime> Morbius
[2:49:59] <RrenKrieg> that gun is worth for pat
[2:50:00] <SaltyAzteca> oh
[2:50:01] <%jillyrancher> @lumberjackjack I dont think it would be that difficult to smuggle guns and armors with the flood of scared refugees. Dunno about the Atlas mechs. probably they arrived after Cerberus had control of C-Sec and the Docks.
[2:50:02] <@Lion_kun> Yo Spider-man trailer dropped
[2:50:02] <@QueequegTheater> Get in there Pat
[2:50:02] <%DrTomT18> there is a switch further up

[2:50:06] <DatAsuna> the talon is neat
[2:50:06] <%Daxalog> Was that the Prey in you?
[2:50:07] <Dunmarkh> this isn't an immersive sim
[2:50:07] <RrenKrieg> if he favors his fast regen
[2:50:09] <%Mr___Pillow> enhanced not ruined by googly eyes lol
[2:50:13] <%chill_o_wisp> @28moogles then play it yourself
[2:50:19] <@QueequegTheater> There is a switch further up
[2:50:21] <DickieWoodsmall_279> been thinking about ME lately and watching the game really gives me an itch to play a different game
[2:50:23] <%trackles_64> Bribe bailey fo r it
[2:50:24] <scrumbotime> glass
[2:50:24] <%ItsYaGirlMaria> i think theres a terminal that unlocks it
[2:50:25] <%AmericanSkidd> its a mystery
[2:50:25] <%AncelDeLambert> gotta get into a fight, probably

[2:57:00] <%jillyrancher> YOU ARE SO AWFUL
[2:57:03] <Tracazoid> They wanted a Vergil, it didn't work out so good
[2:57:04] <heartlesshealer> Big titty armor getaway driver
[2:57:04] <%Ravioli_Ronin> LUL LUL LUL
[2:57:04] <%moonmintparadise> yo why that cerberus girl got such big honkers

[2:57:08] <@QueequegTheater> @PatStaresAt Cuckstream Sam
[2:57:10] <@Lion_kun> We told you Pat, the ending wasn't the only bad thing about ME3
[2:57:11] <%Ravioli_Ronin> The eyes are so good

[2:57:13] <%peachy996> Oh yeah Phantoms look cool but....fuck them in MP
[2:57:13] <%Agami23> i looked away for abit. why has pat turned into a deep one?
[2:57:14] <PaperyHornet1013> He is canonically stronger than shepard
[2:57:16] <%Solid_Stro> He was there during the raid Area 51
[2:57:16] <%CarrowayFashonti> Its Casey Hudsons OC
[2:57:17] <%megadblitz> his eyes are TINY while your eyes are HUGE
[2:57:17] <cpt_langosta> how did you crash with such VISION?
[2:57:18] <Sol_Install> Guys it's legit just Takeda from MK 10
[2:57:19] <Blackleafx> thanks for doing nothing garrus
[2:57:20] <%thekris26> I'm so glad you agree. I fucking hat Kai Lang!
[2:57:20] <%strakillias> It's like somebody at the studio said: "Hey, ninjas are coo. Lets put a ninja in it!"
[2:57:20] <%DrTomT18> I would love for the option to just crash the flying car to kill him
[2:57:21] <%Mr___Pillow> Raiden fused with Adam Jenson, and it's no good
[2:57:21] <arkv01> this was a year before MGR so I guess they thought lets put raiden into ME?
[2:57:24] <%shadowsofpain> He's Thane but super lame
[2:57:24] <BurdRightsActivist> Good thing we're crash landing in a playable area 4Head
[2:57:24] <KeystoneA2> @PatStaresAt You pick up a visor that looks very similar to his later.
[2:57:25] <%valriot> Hes a book character so hes literally someones OC
[2:57:25] <Sp3ctre48> I know we said every game needs a Vergil but not like this
[2:57:25] <%PhantomMiG> @moonmintparadise I noticed that to
[2:57:27] <%cvp5127> discount vergil
[2:57:29] <%LumberjackJack> If you only you were in a spaceship that could spin... or brake... or if you shot more...
[2:57:30] <%CollinsOfBodom> God, this entire section got turned into a fucking cartoon with those eyes
[2:57:31] <%Larry_Q> what the hell is with shepards eyes
[2:57:32] <%AncelDeLambert> Cerberus really is an albatross around this game's neck
[2:57:34] <%SaiyanShoto> That Spider-Man trailer... Holy shit
[2:57:36] <%peachy996> Takeda in MK10 was better than this
[2:57:37] <@goose_attack_almanac> @moonmintparadise It's part of the indoctrination. Fat milkers help infiltration. And buoyancy.
[2:57:37] <GustauveVIII> @PatStaresAt If Thane doesn't exist, then Kirrahe gets stabbed. If Kirrahe is also dead, the Councilor dies.
[2:57:39] <$lotharrio> Is it supposed to be without music?
[2:57:41] <%DrTomT18> He stole Andersons cereal!
[2:57:41] <AngryAsian5> LUL
[2:57:41] <choocheess> hahaha his eyes
[2:57:43] <%Alig200> lol that phantom got rekt by garrus
[2:57:43] <@QueequegTheater> Calling Kai a discount Vergil is an insult to Adam Taurus
[2:57:44] <%xcompleasedad> PHANTOM DEAD
[2:57:44] <perfectharbinger> Oh, is it Phantom time?
[2:57:45] <%trackles_64> Theres a gun in this aprt
[2:57:45] <PaperyHornet1013> CANONICALLY STRONGER THAN SHEPARD

[2:58:02] <DickieWoodsmall_279> remember that time kai leng pissed in anderson's potted plant and ate his cereal while he wasn't home
[2:58:02] <%AmericanSkidd> that phantom got bodied before you could even fight it
[2:58:02] <%Daxalog> yes
[2:58:02] <SaltyAzteca> DONUT STEEL
[2:58:04] <cpt_langosta> oc donut steel
[2:58:05] <DatAsuna> He's real bad in the books too
[2:58:05] <GustauveVIII> @PatStaresAt Watch out for Phantoms. They can one-hit kill you.
[2:58:06] <KeiPrime> oc donut steel
[2:58:06] <$lotharrio> OC forged from pure donut steel.
[2:58:07] <Sol_Install> @peachy996 VERY MUCH
[2:58:07] <%Solid_Stro> Hahaha That Phantom was introduced, then Died c4sageLUL c4sageLUL c4sageLUL
[2:58:08] <%DrTomT18> yeah idk what the fuck they were thinking
[2:58:11] <yourliteraldog> Aren't the mass effect books super fucking bad
[2:58:11] <SpankyMagoo> do a barrel role or something god this upsets me
[2:58:12] <+critikal_bit> OC Donut Steel

[2:58:16] <%cobalt_phoenix_> yeah he's shit
[2:58:18] <%BioHunter> careful, he'll eat ur cereal
[2:58:18] <%captain_kirkhammer> He's from a book karpashyn wrote though he's not that OC donut steel @PatStaresAt
[2:58:19] <%cooldude69xx> Man, phantoms used to scare the shit out of me in  multiplayer
[2:58:19] <%DrTomT18> I would have accepted fucking Zombie Saren over this
[2:58:19] <+jaco_checkbox> Can't believe the googley eyes ruined that dramatic cutscene
[2:58:20] <Sp3ctre48> Yes he eats Anderson's cereal, he's so strong and epic
[2:58:20] <%kyh9> Literally "Coldsteel The Hedgehog" tier
[2:58:22] <+SilverDevilfish> Kai Lang both has a name that makes him sound like he's from early 2000's Mortal Kombat but also looks like an early 2000's Mortal Kombat throw away character.
[2:58:23] <Deoxplosion> Hmm
[2:58:24] <%AncelDeLambert> you read that trash?
[2:58:25] <DSD24> Kai Leng pissed in Anderson's cereal
[2:58:26] <BurdRightsActivist> @yourliteraldog Depends, I suppose
[2:58:27] <heartlesshealer> space ninja book man
[2:58:28] <%maenos2> he is REALLY BAD
[2:58:29] <%kyh9> HE EATS CEREAL
[2:58:31] <viewtifulr> holding
[2:58:31] <%bassoontyphoon> Isn’t every fictional character an OC though???
[2:58:32] <%count_bob> YES.
[2:58:34] <Dabrikishaw> Leng came from the last one, the wrost writer
[2:58:35] <%machshop> i only read the one with saren
[2:58:35] <DatAsuna> The 4th one is a huge level worse
[2:58:35] <+Medrex> he is NOT a Drew invention
[2:58:36] <+jaco_checkbox> would have been so cool
[2:58:38] <%Treasure_Vault> Kul Gai do not steal
[2:58:38] <%count_bob> IT'S THAT ONE.
[2:58:38] <%akscully> yep
[2:58:38] <tronhd> JIN SAKAI? WHY ARE YOU HERE?
[2:58:39] <tanarath> It got worse
[2:58:40] <%charp35> one of the righter was like we have raiden at home
[2:58:40] <zerointelligence000> oh no
[2:58:44] <%Meekest> Yes
[2:58:44] <%Rumbutt> He pisses in Anderson's housplant
[2:58:44] <$lotharrio> Eats cereal and pees in plants.
[2:58:45] <%AmericanSkidd> yeah, it was shit
[2:58:46] <28moogles> That was the FOURTH one.
[2:58:47] <+Medrex> YEEEEEEP
[2:58:48] <KeiPrime> that cereal thing is not just a mass effect thing, that GUY who wrote that one always writes guys eating cereal
[2:58:48] <perfectharbinger> Kai Leng is quite different in this game from the book. In the book, he's *unbelievably* racist. Like "Assault an asari for being an asari" racist.
[2:58:49] <heartlesshealer> :)
[2:58:50] <KeiPrime> or breakfast
[2:58:51] <%AncelDeLambert> the books play merry hell with the lore
[2:58:52] <Sp3ctre48> Yes LUL
[2:58:53] <KeystoneA2> He ate Anderson's cereal.
[2:58:53] <%akscully> yep yep yep
[2:58:53] <+vaderxyz1970> What
[2:58:57] <valstriam> yep
[2:58:58] <arkv01> wow that sounds awful
[2:58:58] <Deoxplosion> Oof
[2:58:59] <+RainFerret> There's a Google doc somewhere with all the things they messed up
[2:59:01] <%Solid_Stro> Wow
[2:59:02] <Blackleafx> send him the google doc
[2:59:03] <%snow_bush> Yup
[2:59:06] <perfectharbinger> Yeah, that's Deception, I believe.
[2:59:06] <dekkitout> Had to patch the book?
[2:59:07] <%peachy996> Yeah that's the one where Kai Leng pees in your plants and eats your cereal
[2:59:08] <heartlesshealer> oof
[2:59:09] <%kyh9> Yeah, he's from the borderline non-canon book
[2:59:12] <%kyh9> YEAH
[2:59:12] <%Retinolgaming> Drew is legit a Genius sci fi writer.
[2:59:13] <%maenos2> DON'T FORGET CURING AUTISM
[2:59:13] <%xcompleasedad> @perfectharbinger Yo, WHAT???
[2:59:14] <KeystoneA2> yes
[2:59:16] <RrenKrieg> yes
[2:59:17] <%snow_bush> Yes
[2:59:18] <%Meekest> @PatStaresAt YES
[2:59:18] <%DrTomT18> I guess?
[2:59:19] <%kyh9> He's basically a fanfic OC
[2:59:20] <kingra> REALLY?
[2:59:20] <+GuilKato> that was the one with the Quarains in pieciemeal clothes not full on environment suites @PatStaresAt
[2:59:22] <28moogles> NO
[2:59:24] <%ahomeschooldropout> YTES
[2:59:24] <%kyh9> And somehow he ended up here
[2:59:25] <PaperyHornet1013> Kai Lang is CANONICALLY stronger than shepard
[2:59:25] <arkv01> what an absolute bungle
[2:59:26] <Sp3ctre48> That poor civilian
[2:59:26] <%trackles_64> NEMSIS SUCK
[2:59:28] <%shadowsofpain> That was the forth book, the 3rd book was from the same author and was good
[2:59:29] <%Treasure_Vault> Reminds me of when that MTG author turned a lesbian arc into just friends lol
[2:59:29] <%DrTomT18> @maenos2 sorry, what?
[2:59:31] <%Agami23> @maenos2 wait what??
[2:59:31] <%cobalt_phoenix_> THAT EXPLAINS A LOT
[2:59:33] <KosOrSomeSayKosm_> oh no don't shoot the thicc spaceman
[2:59:33] <%RAGING_1NF3RNO> I thought he was from the comic.
[2:59:35] <28moogles> He is from the THIRD ONE, also by Drew.
[2:59:38] <+Medrex> it's VERY obvious he wasn't written by the guy who made the universe
[2:59:38] <Deoxplosion> He might as well not be real
[2:59:41] <cpt_langosta> wtf
[2:59:44] <falyden> he's from the 3rd book if I remember correctly
[2:59:44] <%idyota> in the words of mike stoklasa: How embarrassing
[2:59:48] <Zaphire_Saucypants> It's almost like they stopped caring.
[2:59:49] <perfectharbinger> Kai Leng is in multiple books/comics.
[2:59:51] <KeystoneA2> He also murdered Aria's daughter. Because I guess she had one somehow.
[2:59:51] <%cooldude69xx> THATS the book they pulled from?
[2:59:51] <%AncelDeLambert> dumbass didn't even glance at the series bible
[2:59:52] <chainsaw105> oh boy time for the insta-kill enemies!
[2:59:54] <Profmcstevie> They never saw a single screenshot
[2:59:56] <%Daxalog> Oh like warhammer books?
[2:59:56] <yourliteraldog> didn't know shit about the series
[2:59:58] <+D00msDayDan> @maenos2 there's a girl who was autistic and also a super powerful biotic, turns out both were because cerberus was fucking with her
[3:00:00] <%MidnightBurst12> never seen a mass effect
[3:00:00] <%JamesCorck> It wasn't the third book, it was the fourth one, I think.
[3:00:01] <hippofant> If that was the book, why did they add him to the game?! PunOko
[3:00:01] <%LumberjackJack> I thought Kai Leng was in the Anderson book?
[3:00:03] <%maenos2> @drtomt18 a canonically autistic character, and I'm not making this shit up, "grows" out of her autism
[3:00:09] <%kyh9> The opposite argument
[3:00:10] <DickieWoodsmall_279> Kai Lend is the greatest character anyone has ever written
[3:00:11] <Explodincatz> doesnt explain why hes in the game
[3:00:12] <Profmcstevie> But don't ANNIHILATE IT
[3:00:12] <Sol_Install> YEA
[3:00:12] <biomegabear> is 3 still bad?
[3:00:13] <LightningLynx89> Now you see why canon is important Pat
[3:00:13] <%BioHunter> u should look up kai lang... its so bad
[3:00:14] <+TheFlyingChurro> @PatStaresAt The idea has to be cool for that to work
[3:00:14] <$lotharrio> Well it's not a cool idea, though.
[3:00:14] <DatAsuna> @PatStaresAt No, Karpyshyn did 3 books, Kai leng was in the 3rd and 4th, 4th was the one with tons of errors.
[3:00:15] <SaltyAzteca> a not cool idea
[3:00:15] <%peachy996> Kai Leng is....sooo cool
[3:00:16] <%AncelDeLambert> you shouldn't IGNORE cool ideas from the canon, tho
[3:00:18] <%charp35> So it is just fanfiction at that point
[3:00:18] <@Spydurman> shut up tho original OC do not steal!
[3:00:18] <PaperyHornet1013> This is your cool idea pat
[3:00:19] <%afronooch> canon is a guideline not a hard rule
[3:00:19] <28moogles> Everyone saying "yes" has no idea what they're talking about. Kai Leng is from a book by Drew.
[3:00:20] <yourliteraldog> changing canon for not cool odea
[3:00:20] <akitanito> but changing canon for terrible idea
[3:00:21] <%strakillias> The least cool idea is fucking space ninjas
[3:00:22] <zerointelligence000> Following canon at least shows you care
[3:00:22] <DickieWoodsmall_279> Kai Leng is mankind's Opus
[3:00:22] <Kat_k> changing it implies you know what it is to begin with
[3:00:23] <AxelCezar> oh yes is fun until they mess with the things you like
[3:00:23] <%shadowsofpain> He showed up in the third book from Drew and then the fourth book was the bad one
[3:00:24] <ScreamLord> So THAT'S why Kai Lang looks like a rejected Revengence cyborg
[3:00:25] <%kyh9> Do cool stuff, don't do cringe stuff
[3:00:26] <@Lion_kun> Pat, did you know Kai Leng killed a Biotic with a Spoon?
[3:00:26] <Deoxplosion> Yeah there's a limit to the changes
[3:00:27] <Sp3ctre48> That is true yes
[3:00:27] <%DrTomT18> @biomegabear It has its ups and downs
[3:00:29] <%AncelDeLambert> if your idea is basic bitch trash, stick to canon
[3:00:29] <%HaroldDonchee> better is subjective
[3:00:30] <%JoshManVGH> That person must have wrote a book and then was approached to slap a Mass Effect label on it.
[3:00:32] <%valriot> Luckily, Kai Leng is like maybe 10mins of this entire game,and just appears as a cringe lord in a few moments
[3:00:37] <%maenos2> @agami23 an autistic character "grows out" of her autism
[3:00:38] <%Solid_Stro> Retconning Lore is allowed for Cool Shit
[3:00:39] <@commanderclaw> Writers have huge heads and always think their shit is rad
[3:00:42] <%bassoontyphoon> I adore Kai Leng because he is the absolute worst character ever
[3:00:45] <biomegabear> <he's right
[3:00:50] <RushUnplugged> honestly I love how much Kai Leng sucks ass
[3:00:50] <%DianaTheAscian> @PatStaresAt thats subjective as all hell
[3:00:51] <DatAsuna> @28moogles welcome to chat where everyone yes ands without thinking
[3:00:51] <%JamesCorck> The ending of Game of Thrones in a nutshell.
[3:00:53] <%AncelDeLambert> paging Mr. Shyamalan
[3:00:53] <tronhd> @lion_kun are you kidding me?
[3:00:54] <%peachy996> When was Metal Gear Revengeance?
[3:00:55] <%kyh9> It's more about what makes the story better
[3:00:57] <ashtraybandit> who decides what better?
[3:00:57] <%Agami23> @maenos2 wow thats terrible
[3:00:58] <cpt_langosta> but palpatine HAS to be behind it all, you don't understand!
[3:00:59] <CosmicApe13> I love the Reaper plotline
[3:00:59] <+Medrex> If it absolutely breaks the universe and puts huge holes in previous works, DON'T FUCKING DO IT
[3:01:00] <+trashmanasam> @PatStaresAt how was 12 minutes again btw?
[3:01:01] <%jillyrancher> Tbh I like the idea of Cerberus attempting a coup
[3:01:04] <%dawarw0lf> What’s going on!
[3:01:09] <%maenos2> @agami23 BOY IS IT
[3:01:12] <@QueequegTheater> @PatStaresAt Sent you a page from one of the books in Twitter DMs
[3:01:14] <%JoshManVGH> And this is why Last Jedi is a great movie
[3:01:15] <%LumberjackJack> Or if Bakugo turned evil... and doesn't
[3:01:16] <%dawarw0lf> Oh my least favorite mission until the ending
[3:01:19] <Dunmarkh> @dawarw0lf ninjas
[3:01:19] <%DrTomT18> No, but Endevor sure is
[3:01:20] <%kyh9> Or Bakugo betrays everyone to join the villains.
[3:01:22] <perfectharbinger> Kai Leng is also a *super* sexist in those books. Like "Beat the shit out of a dancer for being a dancer" sexist.
[3:01:25] <%cvp5127> thanks god they didnt do that
[3:01:25] <@Lion_kun> Pat, did you know Kai Leng killed an AUTISTIC Biotic with a Spoon? He also breaks into Anderson's House and eats his cereal. I am not making this up.
[3:01:25] <Sol_Install> but he was never an asshole tho...
[3:01:26] <KeiPrime> yeah thats endeaveor's job
[3:01:28] <%captain_kirkhammer> Evil Superman is *so* passe
[3:01:29] <%dawarw0lf> Did Pat cry
[3:01:30] <yourliteraldog> I mean this game shits on Kai Leng
[3:01:30] <%AncelDeLambert> All Might is a cool bro who does his best and coughs up blood and we love him
[3:01:32] <DatAsuna> @PatStaresAt Kai leng was a karpyshyn character, the book with all the errors was a 4th one that just also had kai leng later
[3:01:34] <$lotharrio> Kai Leng is like a shitty Dante, where you're not playing as Dante. He's just some goober who thinks he's rad.
[3:01:36] <ScreamLord> Who's the traitor? Oh I guess nobody is
[3:01:40] <%Tearonex> All Might's great
[3:01:42] <%megadblitz> all might is the biggest non asshole would a villian smile like him?
[3:01:43] <@Moobot> Hey folks, just a reminder! If you have Twitch connected to Discord, you can access the PSA Sub-Discord. Go to your User Settings, go to Connections, and click 'Join' on the PSA server under the Twitch connection.
[3:01:44] <%jillyrancher> All Might rules
[3:01:45] <@QueequegTheater> @PatStaresAt Pat, check your Twitter DMs, trust me on this
[3:01:46] <Sol_Install> THE TRAITOR SHIT
[3:01:47] <%peachy996> @QueequegTheater Please say it's the one where Kai Leng breaks in to pee in plants and eat cereal
[3:01:49] <mr_saturday93> yeah but endenvor is an obvious asshole
[3:01:49] <BurdRightsActivist> SUPER MAN BEING BAD? Nooo, that's never been done before 4Head
[3:01:51] <biomegabear> Does Endeavor deserve redeption chat?
[3:01:54] <@QueequegTheater> @peachy996 Kappa
[3:01:55] <Sol_Install> Now that's an example of being fucking stupid
[3:01:55] <studleydoorite> thank god those garden beds are rocket-proof
[3:01:55] <+unhuggable1> @kyh9 yeah this would be too obvious
[3:01:57] <cpt_langosta> "tough"
[3:02:00] <%jillyrancher> Yes
[3:02:01] <DatAsuna> @lotharrio Nah, he's the mass effect equivalent of assassin's creed daniel cross. lol
[3:02:02] <+Medrex> it's sad how much of a tryhard Kai is.
[3:02:03] <SaltyAzteca> Crazy talk
[3:02:04] <%walternatorz> I like how Pat suggests his squad mates to shoot and doesn't force them with commands. How kind
[3:02:05] <%peachy996> Splendid
[3:02:08] <DXLelouch24> We all though Bakugo was a Sasuke but he told the villains to go fuck themselves.
[3:02:10] <%RetroCop87> psaCrazyhand psaCrazyhead psaMenace psaMenace psaMenace
[3:02:10] <%shadowsofpain> @biomegabear Yeah
[3:02:10] <kingmemelord97> !uptime
[3:02:11] <@Moobot> @kingmemelord97 I've been playing this game for how long? Oh only 3h 2m.
[3:02:11] <%kyh9> @kyh9 It would be the Kishimoto thing to do
[3:02:11] <BurdRightsActivist> BRRRRR
[3:02:14] <dekkitout> The cereal thing is real?
[3:02:14] <Deoxplosion> Kai Leng is what happens when Poochie stays
[3:02:15] <%Monkeyweed21> @DrTomT18 yea but Endeavour is still a good hero he's a scumbag to just his family
[3:02:16] <SaltyAzteca> COMBAT ROLL AGAIN
[3:02:21] <Goatllama> hear me out: "Evil Batman"
[3:02:21] <@QueequegTheater> One day you'll hit something, pat
[3:02:23] <+dd44dostivei> trash character aside, i like this ssequence
[3:02:24] <biomegabear> 2 yeses
[3:02:24] <ape_hawk> anyone else watch the official trailer for spodermang?
[3:02:24] <%maenos2> @dekkitout yes
[3:02:27] <%dawarw0lf> Just in time to say fuck Kai Lang
[3:02:28] <%xcompleasedad> @QueequegTheater Is KL actually racist?
[3:02:28] <+Medrex> the cereal thing IS REAL
[3:02:29] <cpt_langosta> cerberus has upgraded to "flippy-combat-roll"
[3:02:30] <Madinki> KAI LENG IS ALSO VOICED BY TROY BAKER
[3:02:30] <%Shubreaker> Kai Leng is Virgil if Donte was Virgil
[3:02:32] <%Axellogic> I remember all my fights in the multplayer as a krogran vanguard were big gambles of "I hope they dont do the instakill grab while I'm headbutting them in the face"
[3:02:33] <CosmicApe13> These guys must've played basketball cause they breaking Pat's ankles
[3:02:36] <%HaroldDonchee> are the just designed to dodge the first one
[3:02:39] <%jillyrancher> @goatllama Owlman?
[3:02:39] <%peachy996> The fact that someone thought Kai Leng breaking in to eat cereal was cool is....amazing
[3:02:39] <BurdRightsActivist> Destructo disk keeps missing 4Head
[3:02:41] <willsin4fun> like, having Venom Snake exist 'cause Big Boss just surviving & helping MG1 wasn't good enough
[3:02:43] <perfectharbinger> Phantoms are cooler than Kai Leng is.
[3:02:43] <DickieWoodsmall_279> Kai Leng is a better character than Pat Boivin
[3:02:44] <%Tearonex> Endeavor himself says he doesn't want redemption, just atonement
[3:02:50] <%Agami23> things stop being "cool subversive twists" when 20 things do it one after the other. then it becomes a cool subversive twist to do whats normal
[3:02:51] <DSD24> He looks like such a asshole
[3:02:52] <SmigGames> but this dude...
[3:02:53] <+Goraka91> @dekkitout Yes, he broke into his house and ate his cereal and used his toilet while he were there because lmao evil
[3:02:53] <DatAsuna> T POSe
[3:02:53] <cpt_langosta> quick, hold down kai leng and vomit in his hair!
[3:02:53] <%kyh9> STRONG LIARA
[3:02:54] <+Medrex> Phantoms are cool tho
[3:02:55] <dekkitout> I refuse to believe that cereal bit is real. Gimme a damn cite
[3:02:57] <%AmericanSkidd> he even has a harem
[3:02:57] <%Meekest> Why does the asian bad guy have slanty eye visors
[3:02:59] <%LumberjackJack> God forbid, anyone shot in that scene
[3:03:01] <%peachy996> Phantoms hate your Shield so much
[3:03:01] <$lotharrio> Pistol gripping everything.
[3:03:01] <TioXyco> ME3 would be better without Kai Leng
[3:03:02] <Deoxplosion> His mask is just so funny
[3:03:02] <yourliteraldog> phantoms are way cooler
[3:03:02] <%Monkeyweed21> AND HIS SEXY NINJA SQUAD
[3:03:02] <SaltyAzteca> WHAT
[3:03:03] <biomegabear> so dumb
[3:03:04] <%shurtal> this chode
[3:03:04] <yourliteraldog> SHAFT
[3:03:05] <%AncelDeLambert> BUGS BUGS BUGS
[3:03:06] <%RetroCop87> Man, I fucking love how pissed Bakugo haters get from all his character development
[3:03:06] <hairtoday> kai leng is a fun character in the wrong story
[3:03:07] <akitanito> super goof'd
[3:03:08] <KeiPrime> the Cereal Bit is REAL
[3:03:10] <AngryAsian5> Your companions do that with their guns sometimes too LUL
[3:03:11] <%DrTomT18> @Monkeyweed21 He abused his son so bad he became a villain. That's unforgivable
[3:03:12] <%kekkerscrew> In the shaft
[3:03:12] <%megadblitz> why is his visor so fucking lame
[3:03:14] <GustauveVIII> edgy liu kang here
[3:03:14] <%Woodywoo0100> Ha, he said Shaft
[3:03:14] <perfectharbinger> Phantoms are awesome. Just a shame their boss sucks.
[3:03:15] <%kyh9> Stupid Sexy Phantoms
[3:03:17] <BurdRightsActivist> Him and his fuckin LARPER friends 4Head
[3:03:17] <hippofant> @Meekest oh my god I've never even realised that
[3:03:18] <Goatllama> LUL
[3:03:18] <yourliteraldog> pistol grip
[3:03:20] <%peachy996> Phantoms hate your shields and therefore I hate Phantoms
[3:03:20] <arkv01> LUL CLASSIC
[3:03:20] <Blackleafx> GOD
[3:03:21] <Sp3ctre48> ME3 is way funnier with Kai Leng though
[3:03:22] <%AncelDeLambert> this game is held together with spit and twigs
[3:03:24] <cpt_langosta> *speed music plays*
[3:03:25] <+LoliSuperSlam> you can pistol grip anything you want when your eyes are basketballs
[3:03:27] <%chill_o_wisp> lol if you saved Ashley this'd be the part you kill her at
[3:03:27] <%dawarw0lf> Oh my least favorite cutscene (in terms of animation) is coming up!
[3:03:28] <%peachy996> Also their sync kills
[3:03:28] <%Tearonex> ninja OC is too cool
[3:03:29] <Blackleafx> KILL HIS ELEVATOR
[3:03:30] <KeiPrime> that guy also wrote a hti manbook where agent 47 eats cereal
[3:03:31] <%maenos2> kai lengs mask is  ripped off from a rogue helmet in wow
[3:03:33] <+SaphronBlackbourne> was it just me or did shep's eyeballs stick out
[3:03:34] <Goatllama> LATER FUCKERS
[3:03:35] <KeiPrime> its his thing he likes to write about
[3:03:35] <cpt_langosta> F
[3:03:37] <%RetroCop87> @DrTomT18 nah, at some point that just became his son's fault
[3:03:40] <%Ravioli_Ronin> Every floor?
[3:03:46] <$lotharrio> From ninja world.
[3:03:47] <%stickislaw> What makes you think is that Bailey could just make the elevator stop on every floor for anyone he didn't like.
[3:03:51] <%Treasure_Vault> Can I get a mod so that the child looks like Kai Leng and vice versa?
[3:03:51] <%toastybites> @SaphronBlackbourne its been sticking out for the past 15 minutes
[3:03:52] <%jillyrancher> Kai Leng is too big a loser
[3:03:53] <@goose_attack_almanac> So I get that swords are cool and all. But this is a series where the ranged weapons are firing weapons that accelerate micro-filaments of material at speeds that cause ridiculous damage to people.
[3:03:56] <+Kobi_Robi_Tobi> MGR sequence
[3:03:58] <TioXyco> sounded like a turret
[3:03:59] <%peachy996> Thank goodness for Garrus
[3:04:00] <SaltyAzteca> MINI KAI LENGS
[3:04:06] <BurdRightsActivist> It's a good thing these elevators have two waist-high nodules on it, you know, just in case we have a fight on one of these
[3:04:09] <KosOrSomeSayKosm_> e l e v a t o r l e v e l
[3:04:12] <akitanito> what's with the design of these elevators?
[3:04:12] <+Medrex> If Kai had been a brainwashed superphantom instead of a tryhard stalker this game would be better
[3:04:12] <%cooldude69xx> @goose_attack_almanac but ninja swords tho
[3:04:17] <KeystoneA2> Phantoms can easily one-tap your shields
[3:04:17] <%Monkeyweed21> @DrTomT18 yea but the easy way to write would be that he's just evil, the fact he's an amazing hero while being horrifically awful to his family  is more interesting
[3:04:18] <%Ravioli_Ronin> Kai Leng smells like a Chuck E Cheese
[3:04:19] <%captain_kirkhammer> @goose_attack_almanac probably the Dune thing where it gets past shields
[3:04:22] <%shadowsofpain> Dude they are actually real fun to fight but garrus is making them look like nothing
[3:04:22] <@goose_attack_almanac> @goose_attack_almanac true
[3:04:25] <Goatllama> OF COURSE
[3:04:36] <perfectharbinger> There's a mod that removes Kai Leng's dialogue and gives him a Phantom mask.
[3:04:37] <ShiningAxis> maybe he should have frozen all the elevators
[3:04:38] <%Meekest> Oh that was easy
[3:04:41] <SaltyAzteca> See ya later fucker!
[3:04:43] <Deoxplosion> He's such a good hackerman
[3:04:45] <KeiPrime> dune is cool, shield belts you gotta hit slow to penetrate is sick
[3:04:45] <+TrevSmith222> They have palm shots that strips your shields.
[3:04:46] <+dd44dostivei> ME1 elevator
[3:04:48] <%walternatorz> why are there elevators that move at different speeds?
[3:04:55] <+Goraka91> lmao
[3:04:59] <@commanderclaw> Time to kill Kaiden too!
[3:05:00] <DickieWoodsmall_279> every kid that gets bullied in middle school is just a little Kai Leng that hasn't blossomed yet
[3:05:00] <Blackleafx> Btw if Thane is dead then Kirrahe is the guy who stops Kai Leng
[3:05:00] <%AmericanSkidd> here we go
[3:05:01] <dekkitout> "...Leng was...an adrenaline junkie... he checked the cupboards...and had breakfast... it was his apartment now..." Fuck my life...
[3:05:03] <$lotharrio> Udina doing a big traitor.
[3:05:05] <@QueequegTheater> @walternatorz because shut up
[3:05:05] <PaperyHornet1013> I can't wait for kai lang to kick sheapards ass
[3:05:08] <%DrTomT18> If only Shepard had something like, a voice with which to yell with
[3:05:09] <SaltyAzteca> KAIDAN NEEDS SPECIAL EYES
[3:05:09] <%Ravioli_Ronin> Oh god this part
[3:05:11] <akitanito> kaiden don't fuck up
[3:05:12] <RrenKrieg> @walternatorz probably council or spectre overrides
[3:05:12] <cpt_langosta> time for *~*~important decisions~*~*~
[3:05:12] <%cooldude69xx> Kaiden cant go ten minutes without fucking with shepard anymore
[3:05:13] <DatAsuna> If this was Ash, I pick the version where garrus kills her. lol
[3:05:17] <%gaomachine> Yeah if i remember right the dune thing is the explanation since you have to set kind of minimal threshold on your shields so you don't launch a chair across the room when you try to sit down.
[3:05:18] <%HaroldDonchee> man imagine if kaiden just killed shepherd
[3:05:19] <%ahomeschooldropout> @PatStaresAt YOU HAVE THE OPPERTUNITY TO SHOOT KAIDAN FUCKING DO IT
[3:05:25] <cpt_langosta> KAIDEN, MY BRAND!
[3:05:27] <Sp3ctre48> KAIDEN COME ON
[3:05:28] <DSD24> Trust my eyeballs Kaiden
[3:05:29] <%jillyrancher> Kill Ash, don't kill Kaiden
[3:05:30] <%dawarw0lf> I wish this scene was animated bettet
[3:05:33] <%AncelDeLambert> what's goin on is I HAVE SPECIAL EYES
[3:05:34] <%ahomeschooldropout> SHOOT KAIDAN
[3:05:35] <%cobalt_phoenix_> KAIDEN NO
[3:05:35] <%peachy996> This is Ash's big "I hope the REapers send you straight to Hell" moment
[3:05:36] <GohansBeforeHohans> @Blackleafx Wtf Ive literally never heard or seen that lol
[3:05:36] <%walternatorz> time to finish the job you left undone on virmire
[3:05:37] <%RetroCop87> SHEPARD, YOUR EYES

[3:05:38] <akitanito> LOOK INTO MY EYES KAIDEN
[3:05:39] <%Meekest> Shepard why are your eyes so big
[3:05:39] <AngryAsian5> LOOK INTO MY EYES KAIDEN
[3:05:39] <$lotharrio> Look into my eyes... trust me.
[3:05:40] <%HanbaobaoZaiNar> yes, Shepard with his TEAM OF ALIENS is working with the all humans, all the time terrorists
[3:05:40] <scrumbotime> CERBERUS IF KNOWN FOR HAVING ALIEN FRIENDS
[3:05:40] <Blackleafx> This is where you could've shot AShley
[3:05:40] <SaltyAzteca> EYE CAN EXPLAIN
[3:05:41] <%cooldude69xx> DONT CLICK THE INTERRUPTS
[3:05:41] <DatAsuna> Look at his eyes, he's crazy

[3:05:47] <+SilverDevilfish> Kaiden's eyes are bit off too
[3:05:49] <RushUnplugged> I SO much prefer the Kaiden version of this to Ashley
[3:05:50] <%greasypete00> why are your eyes doing this
[3:05:50] <+Goraka91> Special eyes
[3:05:50] <@QueequegTheater> LOOK AT HIS HAND CLIPPING THROUGH THE PISTOL
[3:05:51] <%barrakuta371> Look at my special eyes
[3:05:52] <%DrTomT18> If you DON'T visit Kadien in the hospital, you have to kill him here.
[3:05:52] <Blackleafx> @GohansBeforeHohans yea, Kirrahe dies doing it too
[3:05:54] <%count_bob> "I trust your eyes Shepard."

[3:09:50] <jorniev> ah man
[3:09:50] <%strakillias> Pat shut up, ninjas are cool! /s
[3:09:50] <%GingerStrawhat> Look there's a reason that people hate Kai Leng more then Ashley, more then Kaieden more then Kalisa
[3:09:51] <Madinki> HE WAS THE COLLEST GUY
[3:09:53] <PaperyHornet1013> Bailey > LENG > Shepard
[3:09:57] <tronhd> HE WAS THE COOLEST GUY
[3:09:59] <%cvp5127> HES HAS THE BIGGEST DICK
[3:10:00] <%kyh9> AND HE FUCKS PHANTOMS EVERY DAY, HES SO COOL
[3:10:04] <BurdRightsActivist> Actually you didn't tag me, I still win anyways, you touched my shirt 4Head
[3:10:04] <ScreamLord> Remember that a crippled Drell with lung cancer kicked Kai Leng's ass
[3:10:05] <DatAsuna> Time for a good scene
[3:10:06] <%ForlornCarton> It's like they tried to make someone who would be an actual treat to Sheppard and failed.
[3:10:07] <%jtdobyns> Time to do a citadel walk around
[3:10:08] <@QueequegTheater> @PatStaresAt This is why I always pick Thane romance as Femshep, it's extremely emotional
[3:10:16] <DickieWoodsmall_279> Leng>all others
[3:10:16] <%cooldude69xx> Kai Leng knows every martial art
[3:10:20] <Deoxplosion> HE GOT SOOO MANY BITCHES
[3:10:26] <%jillyrancher> Kai Leng is legitimately one of the worst characters I've ever seen
[3:10:27] <kingmemelord97> the shadow the hedgehog of the mass effect universe
[3:10:28] <%xcompleasedad> @kyh9 Ah yeah, he fucks them brainwashed chicks Kappa
[3:10:31] <%DrTomT18> alright pat buckle up, time for a ton of talking shit and hanging out with people
[3:10:33] <GustauveVIII> kai leng is half russian half chinese THATS WHY HES SO COOL SO EDGY WOW
[3:10:42] <heartlesshealer> HMM
[3:10:42] <SaltyAzteca> Human saved the council...again, so eh
[3:10:45] <%dawarw0lf> A terminally ill drell with weeks to live bested an assassin. Fuck Kai Lang.
[3:10:52] <Madinki> HOW CAN YOU HATE KAI LANG HE'S GOT TROY BAKER TO VOICE HIM @PatStaresAt
[3:10:52] <%Axellogic> Better get those bits of lead outta me
[3:10:52] <dekkitout> I just learned about the peeing in vases thing too NotLikeThis
[3:11:00] <%jackelzxaa> Thane….
[3:11:02] <+Medrex> Cerberus is gonna be remembered as like super Nazis for all galactic history
[3:11:02] <$lotharrio> Kai Leng got snuck up on by a lizard with a death-murder-cough, who beat him enough to scare him into running away. Then he ambushed Shep and managed to kill... Shep's borrowed car.
[3:11:06] <@QueequegTheater> @Madinki Because he sucks
[3:11:11] <Sp3ctre48> There probably should be some kind of consequences for this for the Humans but there's too much going on in this game as it is
[3:11:16] <%cooldude69xx> @dawarw0lf If Thane fought him a month ago, I'm convinced he would have won
[3:11:29] <dekkitout> Why is learning about Leng doing so much cringe damage
[3:11:32] <Deoxplosion> @kingmemelord97 nah, he's the Infinite of the Mass Effect universe
[3:11:33] <%AmericanSkidd> I wonder if he was on the take since ME1?
[3:11:35] <Madinki> @QueequegTheater NAH BUT HE'S THE COOLEST GUY DIDN'T YOU SEE? Kappa
[3:11:39] <%Treasure_Vault> When do Leng and weirdface newslady kiss?
[3:11:39] <Dunmarkh> "If he's so smart how come he's fucking dead?"- Shepard
[3:11:41] <%Eaglestrike117> what happens if you dont take that renegade option?
[3:11:41] <cpt_langosta> where's greenland?
[3:11:42] <BurdRightsActivist> @dawarw0lf Kai Leng gets his toe run over by Thane's wheelchair and he runs away
[3:11:45] <@QueequegTheater> Yup
[3:11:48] <Mattais88> Also no one liked him
[3:11:48] <ryderbootz> Kai Leng has sucked 908 dicks! He's the greatest Ninja in the Galaxy, hes even sucked your dick, Shepard!
[3:11:52] <28moogles> Ah yes, The Boss.
[3:11:52] <%Hiro01231> Hiro01231 subscribed at Tier 1. They've subscribed for 25 months! 
[3:11:52] <%xcompleasedad> We take care of our own LUL
[3:11:55] <%kyh9> Do you think anyone cares about that though?
[3:11:56] <@QueequegTheater> "Shepard is one of the good ones"
[3:11:59] <GustauveVIII> they try so hard to set up kai leng as your nemesis but hes just so left field and forced that all the shit he does is just dumb
[3:12:00] <%kyh9> DIE HARD MAN
[3:12:00] <%shadowsofpain> @dawarw0lf A terminally ill assassin with weeks to live bested an assassin, Thane wasn't just any drell dude
[3:12:00] <wolfen091> Kaden shoots him
[3:12:07] <%kekkerscrew> Mass Effect 1 had a Turian cause all the trouble so it evens out
[3:12:07] <%kyh9> This guy is just Bruce Willis
[3:12:11] <DatAsuna> No, because you can not do the interupt and the virmire survivor can be killed before it, so He can actually be killed by non-humans
[3:12:11] <+Goraka91> That's rough, buddy
[3:12:13] <Aiutare47> Everyone hates Udina anyway though
[3:12:16] <+Medrex> also you backed Anderson as first councilor. so it wasn't your fault at least
[3:12:18] <jorniev> the character that was an asshole turned out to be evil what a surprise
[3:12:25] <Kat_k> too bad you didn't pick anderson to be councilor... oh wait
[3:12:26] <%kyh9> He's just John McClane
[3:12:30] <yourliteraldog> Thane was best assassin in the galaxy and he was sick
[3:12:31] <DickieWoodsmall_279> Udina had to do it or Anderson being replaced would've been harder to justify
[3:12:36] <%bassoontyphoon> Man Kai Leng is a powerful biotic, able to do insane acrobatics, can hack into csec while riding an elevator… wtf
[3:12:41] <blackjack8182> Udina only got the job because Anderson chose to leave office
[3:12:50] <%kyh9> Shit got FUCKED
[3:12:50] <%dawarw0lf> Im imaging Kai saying “mother” and im laughing my ass off
[3:12:53] <%DrTomT18> I love Baily. He's just so... real.
[3:12:53] <+D00msDayDan> the war to end all wars huh
[3:12:55] <GustauveVIII> he can even eat cereal from your apartment without you knowing
[3:12:58] <RrenKrieg> spectre room now
[3:13:00] <%AmericanSkidd> its gonna be a great war
[3:13:02] <%xcompleasedad> @PatStaresAt YES
[3:13:02] <%maenos2> yup
[3:13:07] <+dakarplaugas> HOLY SHIT DOES HE
[3:13:08] <%peachy996> It's so nice Udina got to be rational at the start of the game until this and he just betrayed you cuz.....bwuh?
[3:13:10] <%kyh9> Yes
[3:13:11] <%kyh9> Basically
[3:13:11] <%DrTomT18> Pretty much
[3:13:12] <stormhawk9891> yup
[3:13:13] <%xcompleasedad> Sorta
[3:13:14] <28moogles> DREW WROTE HIM
[3:13:14] <yourliteraldog> feels like it
[3:13:15] <SpaceManHotepIV> LUL
[3:13:15] <PaperyHornet1013> ah give it 25 years
[3:13:16] <+Goraka91> Maybe
[3:13:16] <@QueequegTheater> I like to think so
[3:13:16] <%baka_sugoi> LUL
[3:13:17] <DickieWoodsmall_279> @bassoontyphoon because he eats his breakfast gets big strong
[3:13:18] <%Mr___Pillow> someone said he's a book character
[3:13:19] <+dakarplaugas> I fucking hate Kai Leng
[3:13:19] <Mattais88> No they thought he was cool
[3:13:19] <%moonmintparadise> 100%
[3:13:20] <+Soliloquy123> Can someone explain the Kai Leng cereal thing
[3:13:21] <%kyh9> AND COLDSTEEL THE HEDGEHOG VOMITED
[3:13:21] <%jillyrancher> @patstaresat Check the secondary Codex Pat, there should be a entry about the Cerberus Coup. There should also be one about the "Miracle at Palaven."
[3:13:21] <%AmericanSkidd> it works in that way
[3:13:21] <jorniev> basically
[3:13:22] <%charp35> Hopefully
[3:13:22] <SpankyMagoo> no shit in everyones pants
[3:13:22] <Sp3ctre48> No it's worse, they keep insisting the OC is the coolest guy ever
[3:13:24] <DatAsuna> No, Kai Leng sucks in both books, and Larpyshyn wrote him first
[3:13:26] <hairtoday> kai leng is a wannabe, he's like conrad verner with a ninja sword
[3:13:26] <alrobot2014> motherfucker pisses in vases and steals pops cereal
[3:13:26] <Blank9> butterdragon
[3:13:27] <28moogles> HE ISN'T FROM THE NOVEL YOU'RE SAYING
[3:13:27] <dekkitout> Even the LAMEST Spider-Man villain is way more interesting
[3:13:33] <yourliteraldog> go talk to thane and you tell me
[3:13:34] <Deoxplosion> He actively hurts the game
[3:13:37] <%kyh9> They're new
[3:13:40] <@Lion_kun> Pat, go read emails immediately
[3:13:40] <%kyh9> The shops get updated
[3:13:40] <@QueequegTheater> @PatStaresAt Calling Kai Leng a shitty Jetstream Sam is an insult to Adam Taurus Kappa
[3:13:42] <$lotharrio> I think it's more that they didn't have 100% control, so they couldn't make him win all the time for no reason.
[3:13:42] <Profmcstevie> "and then sasuke just shat himself LOUDLY in front of his brother" no stop writing that "and wore a dress" nooooo
[3:13:43] <DatAsuna> @Soliloquy123 he breaks into anderson's apartment, eats his cereal and pisses in his plants
[3:13:44] <AluxStreams> They needed a character to embody Cerberus fighting Shepard at every turn I guess, but literally anything else would be better than Kai Leng.
[3:13:45] <%CubicPhantom> I think he's managing to suck ass regardless of authorial intent
[3:13:46] <blackjack8182> No he always sucked
[3:13:47] <Aiutare47> He was never cool though
[3:13:49] <%JoshManVGH> This is making the Jessica Chobot decision make more sense
[3:13:49] <%dawarw0lf> I think Kai is meant to be cringe? Like if not how then
[3:13:50] <%charp35> Conrand Verner > Kai Leng
[3:13:52] <%moonmintparadise> He is super edgy cool ninja man because there weren't a lot of asian characters in ME, I guess
[3:13:54] <%xcompleasedad> @PatStaresAt EMAILS
[3:13:57] <%shadowsofpain> He's a jobber that had a cool backstory but was there only for the book fans so he going to job a lot
[3:14:01] <DickieWoodsmall_279> @Lion_Kun Leng email is after thessia
[3:14:01] <tronhd> GARRUS>SHEPARD>KAI LENG

[3:14:05] <chainsaw105> hey its the buggy side mission!
[3:14:09] <+dakarplaugas> I fucking hated him in the books and I fucking hate him here
[3:14:11] <biomegabear> @QueequegTheater christ oof
[3:14:14] <%jillyrancher> Miracle at Palaven is a really sweet codex entry @patstaresat
[3:14:15] <DatAsuna> It doesn't help that he's written by 3 different writers in each appearance, but he sucks in all 3 versions so
[3:14:20] <%dawarw0lf> The best dialogue form Conrad is available now right?
[3:14:20] <@QueequegTheater> @PatStaresAt Before you finish that thought, Spectre emails
[3:14:26] <@Lion_kun> @DickieWoodsmall_279 I thought it was immediately after meeting Leng lol
[3:14:31] <%xcompleasedad> @DickieWoodsmall_279 Fuck, you right.
[3:14:32] <%kyh9> Saren was a MUCH better foil to Shepard
[3:14:41] <%DrTomT18> Reaper War
[3:14:45] <@QueequegTheater> Oh wait, never mind
[3:14:46] <DickieWoodsmall_279> @Lion_Kun he has to shame you first

[3:15:23] <+dakarplaugas> Oh
[3:15:25] <Madinki> @Sartastic SOOOO COOL. LIKE HE'S GOT THE BIGGEST DICK
[3:15:25] <%Ravioli_Ronin> Kai Leng doesn’t wash his ass
[3:15:28] <DatAsuna> Wait, he's in comics too, so 4 writers
[3:15:29] <%jillyrancher> Oh. sorry
[3:15:29] <+dakarplaugas> Neyota
[3:15:33] <Dunmarkh> that's fuckin weird
[3:15:33] <%AmericanSkidd> thats weird
[3:15:34] <%jillyrancher> it's not there yet.
[3:15:36] <dekkitout> I bet Leng would break into your house to steal your new shoes, walk around in them, step in dog poo, wash them, and put the shoes back
[3:15:36] <biomegabear> strutin'
[3:15:36] <%jackelzxaa> More people

[3:16:38] <%captain_kirkhammer> They prolly patched it
[3:16:42] <%jillyrancher> Lol
[3:16:42] <RrenKrieg> i think they fixed it
[3:16:45] <%jackelzxaa> Think they can push humans around
[3:16:46] <PaperyHornet1013> save first
[3:16:48] <Deoxplosion> HE FOLLOWS
[3:16:52] <cpt_langosta> @cpt_langosta yes, but maybe patched in this version, idk

[3:16:59] <%DrTomT18> check out every area
[3:17:01] <%peachy996> Go to the Wards
[3:17:02] <%strakillias> That turian used to be able to push you into the corner and wouldn't move trapping you
[3:17:03] <ryderbootz> thats what you get for being the same race as the legendary assassin, Kai Leng
[3:17:05] <%jackelzxaa> That turian is keeping an eye on you
[3:17:06] <Sp3ctre48> I certainly would like Harbinger to be in this game, I agree
[3:17:08] <BurdRightsActivist> WREX
[3:17:09] <%jillyrancher> Save first
[3:17:10] <DatAsuna> Oh yeah, if you didn't make kelly change her idenitity, cerberus killed her in the raid
[3:17:14] <@QueequegTheater> @PatStaresAt Did you check the spectre emails
[3:17:17] <jorniev> it's like a. airport during war time
[3:17:25] <%peachy996> Dock gets more full
[3:17:33] <blue8moon> that guy looks kinda dead
[3:17:34] <+Goraka91> Elune huh
[3:17:37] <%jackelzxaa> The original game mods add so many people that the game CRASHES if you also run texture mods
[3:17:42] <%jillyrancher> Oh yeah Cerberus will execute Kelly Chambers if you didnt make her change identity. @patstaresat
[3:17:42] <Sp3ctre48> Get your dumb quests Shepard PogChamp
[3:17:47] <%dawarw0lf> Man back to work. Hope you cry in a minute Pat
[3:17:47] <+dd44dostivei> cure them with holy relics
[3:17:50] <%xcompleasedad> @QueequegTheater I think that's after Thessia?
[3:17:55] <Dunmarkh> "yo we can heal these gunshots if we had a nail from the true cross"
[3:17:56] <DickieWoodsmall_279> they should really change those injured people into something more confortable
[3:17:58] <$lotharrio> Fetch Shepard! Harder! FASTER!
[3:17:58] <biomegabear> @PatStaresAt how do you feel about the claim that mass effect 3 in its entirety is an ending and not just its ending
[3:17:59] <fugly_nick> The citadel fetch quests annoy me way more than anything else in the game
[3:18:01] <+dakarplaugas> God I just man fuck Kai Leng
[3:18:04] <BurdRightsActivist> Vaccinated by Jesus
[3:18:07] <@QueequegTheater> @xcompleasedad Spectre emails, not Normandy emails
[3:18:14] <%HaroldDonchee> pretty dire when people are straight up laying on the floor
[3:18:15] <%captain_kirkhammer> I don't know why everyone is spoiling this but yeah Kelly is super dead right now I think
[3:18:15] <+SinnerEbru> time to collect your silly little fetch quests cross this silly little galaxy
[3:18:25] <PaperyHornet1013> ptsd soldier?
[3:18:26] <heartlesshealer> thanks for slow
[3:18:36] <ape_hawk> DID YOU TRY SUCKING HIS DICK?
[3:18:37] <+dakarplaugas> I REALLY FUCKING HATE HIM HE IS SUCH A BITCH
[3:18:45] <%jillyrancher> @captain_kirkhammer He told her to  change her identity so shes fine
[3:18:48] <%DianaTheAscian> are Pats eyes still messed up?
[3:18:55] <%cobalt_phoenix_> he sucks that much
[3:18:55] <%snow_bush> It gets worse
[3:18:55] <%kujofire990> KAI LENG SUUUUUUUUCKS
[3:18:56] <@QueequegTheater> The ones you have to enable.  Not sure if there's any new ones, but it's good to check
[3:18:56] <%NopeBadguy> he might
[3:18:57] <%captain_kirkhammer> @jillyrancher oh nice
[3:18:59] <DSD24> You don't wanna know
[3:19:02] <%Reaviar> one time is 3 times too many
[3:19:02] <%Woodywoo0100> Pretty much
[3:19:05] <dekkitout> My newfound distaste for him is pretty raw at the curent
[3:19:05] <@Lion_kun> The game quality plummters whenever he's on screen.
[3:19:06] <SpankyMagoo> he fucking sucks
[3:19:06] <%peachy996> Oh don't worry your hate will grow. Like a flower
[3:19:07] <$lotharrio> He makes you kiss the Illusive Man.
[3:19:07] <cpt_langosta> kai leng eats your sandwich out of the fridge later
[3:19:07] <+Medrex> He's like the living paragon of the game's writing faults
[3:19:07] <PaperyHornet1013> He fucks you up so bad
[3:19:08] <%hrbeck_> "Have we tried chemically castrating the patients?"
[3:19:08] <+dakarplaugas> He does some stupid shit in the books and yes he does
[3:19:08] <@OfficioPrefectusCorgi> Just goes right up in there
[3:19:10] <TioXyco> the fact Kai Leng exists is just maddening
[3:19:13] <hairtoday> kai leng is the worst in a very real way
[3:19:16] <%demiiluna> because it's poisoned
[3:19:17] <Dunmarkh> A POISON KNIFE
[3:19:19] <zerointelligence000> maybe it was Kai Leng?
[3:19:20] <%xcompleasedad> They wanted to waste the ICU bed
[3:19:20] <%moonmintparadise> he might aswell shake and tell you how cool he really is while crying later
[3:19:20] <ape_hawk> because kai leng is edgy
[3:19:21] <ryderbootz> Kai L:eng steals a bunch of cakes later, its terrible
[3:19:22] <%Aleate> Space knife
[3:19:22] <%AmericanSkidd> because its cerberus
[3:19:22] <DickieWoodsmall_279> chat can't accept that Dai Wang invoked their sexual awakening
[3:19:23] <blue8moon> cause they ran out of ammo?
[3:19:23] <%Agami23> wasent naruto really popular in the west around the time this was in development?
[3:19:23] <Mattais88> Because it would hurt more
[3:19:23] <Psyramics> why would you poison the knife you use in your invasion
[3:19:24] <%shadowace2400> goes through the shield?
[3:19:24] <Kat_k> excuse me, it's called a katana
[3:19:27] <Sartastic> he punches his own ass
[3:19:28] <%LumberjackJack> He steals your LEGOS and shits in your toilet.
[3:19:29] <ShiningAxis> he has the power of narrative behind him later
[3:19:30] <%JamesCorck> Military has knives.
[3:19:33] <%hrbeck_> so it can be poison
[3:19:36] <@QueequegTheater> Pragmatism vs. Altruism
[3:19:36] <%DrTomT18> this one doesn't effect your war assets. Pick whichever one you agree with
[3:19:38] <%jillyrancher> It's really fucked up. They just ask her if shes Kelly, and she says yes, then troopers blow her head off. shits fucked.
[3:19:39] <%captain_kirkhammer> bruh they are literally arguing triage like holy hit do these writers do research
[3:19:41] <+Medrex> Kai and the kid together represent the game at its worst
[3:19:45] <PaperyHornet1013> Kai leng did it pat
[3:19:45] <+ScrapKingKeita> Oh god, Triage suuuuuuuuucks
[3:19:47] <heartlesshealer> for concealment
[3:19:47] <DSD24> I'm with the Salarian
[3:19:48] <%shadowsofpain> Honestly I think we're blowing it out of proportions, KL sucks but it's not like he's the worst character
[3:19:50] <%AmericanSkidd> this is called triage
[3:19:50] <@QueequegTheater> IMO she's super right
[3:19:53] <GustauveVIII> do whatever pat
[3:19:54] <%Eaglestrike117> Go with the human, thats literally fucking triage
[3:19:56] <Sp3ctre48> Human right
[3:20:00] <jorniev> i like that one dialogue where even criminals are not cool with stealing supplies from refugees
[3:20:00] <%count_bob> She
[3:20:01] <%Ravioli_Ronin> Lmao why are they debating triage??
[3:20:03] <+OmegaFatalis> Hello, Laura Bailey
[3:20:03] <%akscully> she wants to save the rich
[3:20:04] <%count_bob> She's right.
[3:20:05] <%Treasure_Vault> this is just called triage
[3:20:08] <%CubicPhantom> Triage is a thing
[3:20:12] <RushUnplugged> it's just triage
[3:20:13] <%peachy996> Funny how the Salarian is more idealistic though
[3:20:13] <%Ravioli_Ronin> HOSPITALS DO THIS
[3:20:14] <$lotharrio> Triage is a thing, sorry.
[3:20:15] <+Goraka91> It's also weird it's the Salarian on that side
[3:20:16] <+ThomasOfTroy> She super is, it's called fucking triage and literally everyone does it in a crisis
[3:20:17] <@Lion_kun> Kai Leng is like Raiden from Metal Gear if he wasn't a parody.
[3:20:19] <+dakarplaugas> THE FUCKING CAMERA IS TELLING YOU THAT KAI LENG IS COOL....also Triage is a thing shut up dumb ass
[3:20:20] <@OfficioPrefectusCorgi> Triage
[3:20:20] <@QueequegTheater> This has been a thing in combat medic training for literally hundreds of years
[3:20:21] <CosmicApe13> she wants to save people who have more of a chance
[3:20:24] <fugly_nick> The Salarian does offer a good alternative solution if you side with him
[3:20:25] <%cobalt_phoenix_> lol no you won't man
[3:20:30] <%Treasure_Vault> This is medical ethics day 1
[3:20:37] <%jillyrancher> It sucks but yeah shes right
[3:20:40] <tanarath> Pat, she's going to do it where the rich & connected survive
[3:20:41] <%DrTomT18> If you agree with the Salarian they end up agreeing to ask people for donation money
[3:20:42] <kingmemelord97> when did chat go into slow mode ?
[3:20:47] <DSD24> That's why I like going for the Salarian
[3:20:47] <%peachy996> Of course the human has to be right though
[3:20:53] <RrenKrieg> right now
[3:20:56] <%Aeoneth> Why does Shepards Right arm look broken
[3:21:03] <Goatllama> @kingmemelord97 when people couldn't control themselves
[3:21:04] <%AmericanSkidd> the way shepard says that is really threatening to me
[3:21:04] <@QueequegTheater> @PatStaresAt Triaging like she is suggesting literally saves more lives than his idealistic idiocy
[3:21:07] <Sp3ctre48> @DSD24 People were yelling about a bunch of stuff
[3:21:09] <$lotharrio> Aww.
[3:21:09] <+D00msDayDan> i thought it was a lung disease, not a blood disease
[3:21:11] <blue8moon> why would you use thane's real name when he told you his cover name?
[3:21:15] <+geekjacob> can we not but his body into a robot?
[3:21:18] <heartlesshealer> a few minutes ago, there's reasons for slow
[3:21:20] <%mecha_11> Do I have to play the other ones to jump into 3?
[3:21:22] <%DrTomT18> I will go to the Drell homeworld and start collected Drell for him!
[3:21:23] <+Soliloquy123> That sounds like Shepard is offering to go murk some drell
[3:21:25] <DickieWoodsmall_279> "I'll get more" 0_0
[3:21:27] <cpt_langosta> "Not enough drell blood? Gimme a sec!" "Shepard, no, that's incredibly counter-productive!"
[3:21:27] <%peachy996> Oh this scene is awkward imo
[3:21:29] <DapperCadavr> ;-;
[3:21:31] <+Ropcord> PepeHands
[3:21:32] <%Ravioli_Ronin> dnmSadge dnmSadge dnmSadge dnmSadge
[3:21:35] <%xcompleasedad> @mecha_11 YES
[3:21:36] <GustauveVIII> QUINTON FLYNN
[3:21:36] <%kyh9> deathbed handy?
[3:21:38] <DSD24> Asking for Donations isn't idiocy though
[3:21:39] <+Medrex> oh yeah this is why people hate Kai too. cause he's the reason for this
[3:21:40] <%AmericanSkidd> its fine
[3:21:40] <willsin4fun> Raiden!
[3:21:41] <@QueequegTheater> @D00msDayDan Both, it interferes with the lungs' ability to process oxygen into the blood
[3:21:41] <+Goraka91> Only one model LUL
[3:21:41] <+Bail_Seven> @mecha_11 play 2
[3:21:41] <%count_bob> @D00msDayDan It is, but the blood gets affected. Like sickle cell.
[3:21:47] <%GalacticaPhanto> as@mecha_11 yes. why would you start at 3
[3:21:49] <Sp3ctre48> We're really mopping up the ME2 cast huh LUL
[3:21:49] <%CubicPhantom> Man it always shocks me how bad medical tech is in ME in general
[3:21:50] <%peachy996> It's meant to be sad but his eyes never close and that ruins the scene
[3:21:51] <+dakarplaugas> @D00msDayDan Lungs affect the amount of Oxygen in your blood
[3:21:55] <+OmegaFatalis> They have one model, Pat
[3:21:57] <+Soliloquy123> You're the one other drell in all of Mass Effect, Kolyat.
[3:21:58] <%GalacticaPhanto> God Quinton fucking sucks
[3:21:59] <Madinki> Hey Yuri
[3:21:59] <biomegabear> @mecha_11 you wont understand alot but just playing 2 before hand is good enough
[3:21:59] <yourliteraldog> i like this scene
[3:22:00] <DapperCadavr> the drell skin looks so good in the remaster
[3:22:02] <$lotharrio> @mecha_11 Sorta. The game is pretty dependent on you knowing things, and also remembers a fair amount of stuff you did.
[3:22:05] <%GalacticaPhanto> great VA but shitty dude
[3:22:07] <jorniev> people who romanced him had it pretty rough
[3:22:07] <RrenKrieg> space jensen
[3:22:09] <DSD24> This scene is sad
[3:22:10] <Deoxplosion> One last suck on his tongue
[3:22:12] <%hrbeck_> "Hero Sheppard donates over 1000 Gallons of Drell blood- says "this will never happen again"
[3:22:15] <%jillyrancher> it's nice seeing Kolyat again.
[3:22:16] <Goatllama> LUL

[3:24:57] <%xcompleasedad> Did the dog ACTUALLY just ruin BOTH of the deaths?????
[3:24:58] <@Lion_kun> Thane was one of my favorite ME2 party members and it makes me so mad he was killed by Kai Leng.
[3:25:01] <PaperyHornet1013> This chat would have turned against geif if he interupted mordins death
[3:25:01] <%Meekest> ITS FINE hes an alien
[3:25:01] <%peachy996> So rude! you just closed his eyes
[3:25:02] <%kyh9> "Kolyat, has Shepard left yet?"

[3:47:56] <%shadowsofpain> the Paige alien
[3:47:57] <%GueyDuckB> talk to joker
[3:47:57] <$lotharrio> It's why Joker was debating coming up to dance.
[3:47:58] <tronhd> alien paige
[3:47:58] <%JamesCorck> So, what was Bioware doing while "researching how to taqstefully do a homosexual romance"? Most likely rushing through the game's programing, because the writing for Steve's romance feels rushed as fff-
[3:47:59] <kingra> Edi looks uncomfortable LUL
[3:47:59] <blue8moon> slight movements, for she does not know how to dance LUL
[3:48:00] <FlyguyJP> Tali is the only correct choice
[3:48:00] <%Faustgesicht> She learned BY WATCHING YOU
[3:48:00] <@commanderclaw> The fragile nerdy one huh?
[3:48:01] <sougoe> She's downloading the dance executable
[3:48:02] <%DrTomT18> Fun fact Pat! If you don't romance Tali or Garrus they start dating!
[3:48:03] <%HaroldDonchee> just standing awkwardly
[3:48:03] <%kyh9> PUNCH HIM
[3:48:05] <%LumberjackJack> Paige is getting mad at Tali, already
[3:48:06] <CosmicApe13> Joker can dance?? wouldn't a simple movement fuck up his bones??
[3:48:07] <%Romuken> EDI feels threatened?
[3:48:07] <%moonmintparadise> THEY COULDNT MAKE HER DO THE ROBOT ? COME OOOON

[3:48:11] <zerointelligence000> Jack?
[3:48:11] <yourliteraldog> Immuno Compromised

[3:48:16] <AngryAsian5> Jack?
[3:48:17] <%jackelzxaa> Is cortez the first gay male game character in a western game
[3:48:17] <Clundy> The Bible says Adam and Eve not Shepherd and Steve
[3:48:19] <hairtoday> visor is the only clothes she wears
[3:48:19] <%peachy996> Not gonna talk to Jack?
[3:48:20] <terrible35> Jack

[4:12:39] <+Medrex> IMAGINE IF THE ENDING HAD AS MUCH LOVE AS CONRAD JUST GOT?!
[4:12:39] <%Tarage> He wants to tussle
[4:12:40] <+GalacticaPhanto> @patstaresat Goblins SATISFIED
[4:12:41] <alrobot2014> @knightoftrousers nah he was lying about the wife
[4:12:41] <%AmericanSkidd> is he banging the couch?
[4:12:50] <DatAsuna> No, dark energy is dumb because the reaper actively force us to use the tech that makes the problem and it had no explanation for why
[4:12:50] <%InternetShis> He so tall
[4:12:50] <FlyguyJP> ME3 is such a great game. So much fan service. God if only they didn't fuck up the ending can you imagine.
[4:12:50] <%JohnAtDawn> ...He's not getting off the Citadel is he?
[4:12:52] <AthenaAegis> GIVE SQUEAKY
[4:12:52] <+GuilKato> Spectre place for spectre terminal
[4:12:54] <+unhuggable1> @KnightOfTrousers he admits that was a lie
[4:12:55] <KnightOfTrousers> @KnightOfTrousers Oh my god...
[4:13:00] <%Monkeyweed21> THIS IS A CONTINUITY BUKKAKE
[4:13:05] <stantheman_97> he wants it
[4:13:06] <%Tarage> FATHER RETRIEVE TOY FROM BLACK HOLE
[4:13:07] <%shadowsofpain> specter terminal
[4:13:07] <%DrTomT18> @Medrex seriously the ending should have been like Dragon Age Origins. Just a long slide show
[4:13:10] <+Tonku_the_Red> Human get my toy!
[4:13:17] <%jillyrancher> Chellik and Morlan and Jahleed save the Universe from the Reapers
[4:13:18] <$lotharrio> He's just curious about the couch's mystery hole.
[4:13:19] <%pokefan9956> >continuity bukkake
[4:13:19] <%TheotherKristian> So, these are different medias, but which ended worse, ME 3 or Game of Thrones and why was it Game of Thrones?
[4:13:21] <scrumbotime> He's just Standing There
[4:13:21] <heartlesshealer> you really just leave the keyboard at his paws
[4:13:22] <DatAsuna> also heat death of the universe is the plot of like 20 animes
[4:13:29] <terrible35> you cant stop him
[4:13:30] <%Piemono> The Spider-Man Trailer is out
[4:13:30] <FlyguyJP> He will WILL a toy there.
[4:13:31] <%AgniBrandt> This is Zangief's stream now
[4:13:33] <%cooldude69xx> This is amazing, Geif even knows Conrad might die there
[4:13:34] <KnightOfTrousers> (just joined 2 minutes ago, I thought Pat said this would be Tuesday!)
[4:13:37] <%strakillias> Father, I want the Buscemi
[4:13:39] <%shadowsofpain> @drtomt18 you mean like the extended cut?
[4:13:39] <leinadtonu> He's just staring at the ghosts
[4:13:40] <%AzureGale> Gief is like the baby two-year old humans that drop things off of high chairs and then just stare at it and the cry because they don't have it anymore
[4:13:42] <%Tarage> TUSSLE
[4:13:43] <%AmericanSkidd> Game of thrones
[4:13:44] <Deoxplosion> @theotherkristian Game of Thrones
[4:13:47] <%DrTomT18> @TheotherKristian At least Mass Effect got a patch.
[4:13:48] <KruxisV> GoT is worse and it isn't close
[4:13:51] <ConflagrationsGaming> because at least theres good stuff in ME3, last season of GoT sounds like it was a shitfest the whole way through
[4:13:54] <+jojo_abob> :0
[4:13:54] <Goatllama> do we need emotes only chat SirMad
[4:13:55] <Jaysky> @TheotherKristian At least ME3 allowed speculation whereas GoT was just awful garbage.
[4:13:56] <+D00msDayDan> @TheotherKristian all of this shit in ME3 that isn't the ending is fantastic, i don't know how that last season went before the shit ending
[4:13:57] <%doc_ock_rokc> @TheotherKristian Wait for it ME3 is gonna shit the bed
[4:14:01] <Ner234> he mad
[4:14:01] <dekkitout> @TheotherKristian I think we just saw Verner tip the scales, endings regardless
[4:14:01] <%jillyrancher> @drtomt18 That IS the ending. It's pretty much a slideshow after the EU.
[4:14:01] <fugly_nick> That is indeed how it is
[4:14:02] <%peachy996> talking shit get hit
[4:14:03] <+ThomasOfTroy> @KnightOfTrousers Woolie wanted to reschedule the podcast
[4:14:03] <%mike2hands> its time to ground the BEEG BABE
[4:14:03] <cpt_langosta> gief swim in couch cushion
[4:14:04] <rocketdog96> arf
[4:14:04] <KnightOfTrousers> DO NOT WATCH THE SPIDERMAN TRAILER. Apparently it's spoilerific
[4:14:04] <PaperyHornet1013> Could geif maul you if he really wanted too?
[4:14:06] <%RetroCop87> ... is he stuck?
[4:14:07] <%brisk_dacat> That dog got some Sass
[4:14:08] <%DrTomT18> @shadowsofpain That was no where near as detailed as Origins
[4:14:09] <%Tarage> Him attac
[4:14:10] <%Mr___Pillow> "Conrad then admits that he has a "tasteful" picture of Shepard surrounded by candles as a shrine"
[4:14:11] <%FaderPotater> the revolution has begun.
[4:14:13] <stantheman_97> FATHER GIVE ME TOY
[4:14:15] <FlyguyJP> Pat must now assert dominance or lose his throne as Alpha of the home.
[4:14:17] <Parapattern> Look at him
[4:14:25] <%DrTomT18> oh read the finacial report!
[4:14:28] <%jackelzxaa> pat check the map for every area to make sure you didnt miss any consoles or anything like that
[4:14:29] <@QueequegTheater> Chat do not make me put emote mode on
[4:14:29] <%brisk_dacat> Gief better behave before we call his mom on him.
[4:14:38] <%bassoontyphoon> Game of thrones because at least me3 has many redeeming moments, but the finale is poop. GOT is just shit all the way through the final season
[4:14:45] <%Tarage> Put emote mode on

[4:24:58] <blue8moon> neat
[4:25:00] <%shadowsofpain> Like other than just using Christian symbolism due to it being cool looking everything else was very personal and therefore not "wrong" lol
[4:25:00] <tanarath> Are they stealing mods?
[4:25:00] <%bassoontyphoon> Anime toddies
[4:25:01] <Dunmarkh> it's "500 creation club elements", whatever the fuck that means
[4:25:03] <@DakotaMacDoodle> for free
[4:25:03] <+ThomasOfTroy> 500 mods inclduing graphics, weapons, quests, etc
[4:25:06] <%DrTomT18> it could be a whole different game! I have no idea!
[4:25:09] <%jackelzxaa> pat did you know they tried to get mako working for ME3 but a physics bug caused them to cut the feature early in because they ran out of time to get it working
[4:25:13] <%MidnightBurst12> it's crazy
[4:25:15] <28moogles> you can fish
[4:25:15] <dekkitout> All of it? For real for real? Where can I read this?
[4:25:15] <%Mr___Pillow> the rerelease of Witcher 3 be doing that too
[4:25:17] <%derpy_platypus> Hoping for a spell revamp
[4:25:17] <%Solid_Stro> sabert14Box
[4:25:18] <@QueequegTheater> @DrTomT18 Alright Todd Kappa
[4:25:19] <%DrTomT18> and also fishing!
[4:25:19] <$KnivesEve> stolen mods possibly
[4:25:24] <%jillyrancher> @patstaresat Can't wait for the Quarian arc Pat you'll love it.
[4:25:39] <@QueequegTheater> Yup
[4:25:41] <%DrTomT18> pretty much
[4:25:44] <+dd44dostivei> they should have been upgrading the game all along
[4:25:45] <%jackelzxaa> can't wait for the blussy arc
[4:25:51] <Dunmarkh> THERE ARE ONLY 48 CREATION CLUB ITEMS
[4:25:55] <@goose_attack_almanac> @jillyrancher who doesn't love Quarians.
[4:25:58] <@QueequegTheater> @PatStaresAt Selling the mods is much more of a grey area though
[4:25:59] <%Nobrev> i think once you put them into creation club you have to sign it over to bethesda
[4:26:02] <heartlesshealer> but will any of the included mods let the werewolves destroy my body at spawn?
[4:26:02] <%shadowsofpain> Yeah New Vegas got a lot of "Stolen mods" into its design
[4:26:04] <%jackelzxaa> imagine if game of thrones got a patched ending
[4:26:11] <stantheman_97> i think they should just credit the creators
[4:26:11] <$KnivesEve> fair i just have a dislike towards bethesda
[4:26:14] <%shadowsofpain> and it's great
[4:26:18] <%jillyrancher> @goose_attack_almanac Everyone, Quarians suck! KonCha
[4:26:23] <Profmcstevie> Strives a small roster, jump about and learn your enemy
[4:26:23] <%DrTomT18> @shadowsofpain same with Fallout 4. Mostly the 'building a settlement' thing
[4:26:33] <%jillyrancher> @patstaresat Are you gonna try Jack-O
[4:26:41] <%jackelzxaa> is pat gonna do the dlc's at the end before the final mission?
[4:26:43] <@QueequegTheater> Anything above standard "Hot" sauces just doesn't have enough flavor for it to be worth it IMO
[4:26:51] <%trackles_64> Your still alive tho
[4:26:53] <dekkitout> What is this, some kind of Suicide Sauce?
[4:26:55] <Aiutare47> Anchorbar is amazing
[4:26:57] <%jackelzxaa> @PatStaresAt What are your thoughts on the Jack-O pose draw meme?
[4:27:00] <%shadowsofpain> Yeah developers have been looking at mods for improvement for years if not decades
[4:27:01] <stantheman_97> suicide is badass
[4:27:02] <%MechArch> i did a hot burger challenge this weekend. wrecked my asshole
[4:27:04] <%BinaryFireball> lol
[4:27:11] <%derpy_platypus> it hot
[4:27:12] <%DrTomT18> @QueequegTheater Mood. Watching The Hot Ones is painful
[4:27:15] <$Falilth> @QueequegTheater you say that but try some of heatonist hotsauce's they are really good
[4:27:16] <%jillyrancher> Jack-O butt
[4:27:19] <%MidnightBurst12> 250,000 to 1 mil
[4:27:20] <@goose_attack_almanac> @jillyrancher No they can't suck. They'll die!
[4:27:22] <%DrTomT18> SO PAT, When will you be on The Hot Ones?
[4:27:22] <%trackles_64> Not that hot
[4:27:24] <%RealThiele> 1look for  a pepper name
[4:27:28] <Mattais88> AnchorBar Hamilton is alright. Had a waffle sandwich there once
[4:27:33] <cpt_langosta> no thank you sir
[4:27:36] <%jackelzxaa> i saw a couple VERY GOOD jack-o meme drawings.  I'm considering doing one myself...
[4:27:37] <Profmcstevie> Spicy but not threatening
[4:27:41] <dekkitout> The sauce that almost killed you and woolie?
[4:27:48] <%shadowsofpain> Pat on hot ones would be hilarious
[4:27:49] <%jillyrancher> @goose_attack_almanac They can, they just have to spit.
[4:27:53] <%jackelzxaa> the meme is just "LOOK AT THIS ASS"
[4:27:56] <%trackles_64> weak
[4:28:00] <@goose_attack_almanac> I'm growing Ghost and Carolina Reapers in my backyard
[4:28:03] <$SGrim> Carolina Reapers are just pain
[4:28:03] <+Saggitori> woolie did
[4:28:08] <leinadtonu> Are these dragon ball power level numbers?
[4:28:11] <$Falilth> @PatStaresAt  as someone who ate a ghost pepper. it's not that bad.
[4:28:12] <%jillyrancher> @jackelzxaa I mean Jack-O ass is lovely.
[4:28:18] <%Nobrev> cayenne has a little kick but it's not super hot
[4:28:22] <%AncelDeLambert> you insane insano
[4:28:22] <@QueequegTheater> @QueequegTheater @Falilth You fail to keep in mind I am a Chicago baby whose hottest sauce growing up was marinara
[4:28:42] <%jackelzxaa> kai leng actually came from the last good book written by drew k, the third one.  The 4th book was the bad one that came out when me3 did
[4:28:43] <dekkitout> Bright side, if something like a squirrel eats the reaper, it sure wont again
[4:28:44] <+HeathCottengim> !uptime

[4:29:27] <%jillyrancher> It's been like 6 months between ME2 and 3. that's a lot of time to build up forces.

[4:29:36] <@QueequegTheater> I can't get into FF15, the combat feels awful
[4:29:38] <@goose_attack_almanac> I had fun watching the collective thirst for Gladio taking his shirt off.
[4:29:39] <Profmcstevie> Nothing wrong with some down time
