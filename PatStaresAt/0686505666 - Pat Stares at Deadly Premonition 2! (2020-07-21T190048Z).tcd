[0:23:38] <JonnyJug> It seems better
[0:23:38] <%Starotter70> Now talk
[0:23:38] <megamirk> seems a bit better
[0:23:38] <Scotaku> I want Patty to just say "Snarf!" when you pick her up once.
[0:23:39] <%CJett92> it looks very mildly better
[0:23:44] <%Laecerelius> UFOOOOOOOS!
[0:23:45] <bluebiscuit94> This looks better to me, I could actually play this
[0:23:45] <tranquilturnip> Pat how did we get from DP1 on the Xbox to this?
[0:23:48] <CappuccinoGuil> @Dakuu75 after you break it in a cutscene, they introduce the durability mechanic to the board
[0:23:48] <Helmed> ufo pornnoooo
[0:23:49] <wannabemoogle> nice
[0:23:50] <OldManDeckardCain> DO NOT UPSKIRT THE CHILD
[0:23:51] <%spongeofmystery> And you didn't get some kind of 70% done test build?
[0:23:51] <%arancet> this is def better, at least more consistent
[0:23:51] <%AliceAstro> ooo!
[0:23:53] <%hzealot> 50 whole doll hairs?
[0:23:54] <$Afterman_> low quality
[0:23:54] <%cvp5127> looks better
[0:23:55] <%Laecerelius> lol
[0:23:56] <+xTheAngryDwarfx> The game isnt breaking so its better
[0:23:57] <+LandOfTheWay> damn, just got here; i miss anything?
[0:24:00] <%Quigsies> Slight improvement
[0:24:00] <%NRHR_OTEN> it's actually a little noticably better.
[0:24:06] <%StaceMcGate> Holy shit, Pat is rich
[0:24:06] <%SmoochSpider> psaDab
[0:24:08] <%Dakuu75> @CappuccinoGuil ah, ok. gotchya
[0:24:09] <@commanderclaw> I'm not physically ill from watching, so I guess it's improved
[0:24:10] <KingHyperbole> this doesn't even LOOK PLAYABLE
[0:24:13] <$Afterman_> @LandOfTheWay not really
[0:24:21] <+mckraven> I like how the money just falls through the floor
[0:24:26] <JunkyardCrow> Its been upgraded from headache-inducing to simply eye-straining SeemsGood
[0:24:27] <+xTheAngryDwarfx> Holy shit your money
[0:24:29] <+LandOfTheWay> @Afterman_ cool, thanks
[0:24:31] <CeaselessSlick> UFO PORNO
[0:24:35] <stabbityrabbit> I heard they put out a parch for the framerate, did I hear wrong?
[0:24:35] <amonimis> did you ever finish bowling challenge @patstaresat
[0:24:35] <lioxor> id say we got like 2-5 extra fps now
[0:24:35] <phantomsleeves> is the framerate...better?
[0:24:36] <KingHyperbole> wait commanderclaw this is somehow *better*?
[0:24:37] <pennykettle_> waiting on the VR release to play this
[0:24:40] <%AliceAstro> eat it
[0:24:41] <%ClericOfSparda> It actually is running better
[0:24:41] <JonnyJug> DP2 is actually an MMO with all the players on the same openworld, but they're invisible
[0:24:41] <%Dakuu75> Literally collecting space-bucks
[0:24:41] <xanderfist> seems smoother
[0:24:43] <CappuccinoGuil> So, seems like the trans character issues weren't really addressed?
[0:24:47] <%Garthunox> Pat did you beat the bowling?
[0:24:49] <phantomsleeves> oh it is
[0:24:50] <%DappercatEsquire> never stop asking about it

[0:24:57] <%StaceMcGate> Are you winning bowling son?
[0:25:00] <noyman2000> Finish it!
[0:25:00] <ShichiNoBushi> Stormy: "I'm into this string now." Quinn: "That string I gave him should buy us some time."
[0:25:03] <+mckraven> @stabbityrabbit no this is the improved version
[0:25:09] <Scotaku> wens bowling stream?
[0:25:13] <TrashbagZombie> But what about the bowling?
[0:25:13] <%Laecerelius> Fell out of world?
[0:25:14] <%NRHR_OTEN> Yeah, I definitely can stand to look at it without vomiting now, so it's a definite improvement.
[0:25:18] <%Dakuu75> it fell throguh the world???
[0:25:19] <+Brostress> Through the world and back into dp1
[0:25:20] <%ringabal> Greatest child in the world
[0:25:20] <jorniev> IT WAS LOST TO TIME
[0:25:23] <+ConLin_Arts_> monkaS
[0:25:25] <%twistedj3ster> Cowards live long enough to feel their shame
[0:25:27] <phantomsleeves> it actually looks a bit better i’m impressed
[0:25:27] <%spongeofmystery> I stopped playing Death Stranding for this?
[0:25:28] <%Dakuu75> WUUUUUUUUUT LMAO
[0:25:30] <pennykettle_> you should be able to press a button to get Patti to sniff out items
[0:25:31] <Valentinius_Anodyne> Sorry nothing
[0:25:32] <%cvp5127> oh well youre locked out of the good end pat
[0:25:33] <%SmoochSpider> Patti has too much power

[0:25:34] <Helmed> NIKOOOO MY COUSIIINNNN
[0:25:35] <jorniev> OR IT FELL THROUGH THE WORLD

[0:25:38] <faruya> How can Ghost of Tsushima even compete
[0:25:39] <%NRHR_OTEN> It went into the Bowling Alley
[0:25:41] <+xTheAngryDwarfx> Why york dressed like hitman?
[0:25:41] <%StaceMcGate> the item is spawning before it hits the ground
[0:25:48] <noyman2000> You might get it if you bowl
[0:25:51] <%DappercatEsquire> unreal
[0:25:57] <phantomsleeves> nice
[0:25:57] <pennykettle_> but at what cost
[0:25:58] <+ConLin_Arts_> PogChamp
[0:26:00] <+Skelegroove> Camera isn't moving in large chunks currently
[0:26:03] <%Dakuu75> This game is a busted-ass, treat
[0:26:04] <Dao_Puppy> What happens when you look straight down now?
[0:26:05] <JonnyJug> This isn't causing a headache, which is a considerable improvement
[0:26:07] <johndoe0920> Holy shit this is jank as fuck.
[0:26:08] <+ConLin_Arts_> MASAKA???
[0:26:08] <%GarbageQueenEllie> York can skate so fast

[0:26:37] <tranquilturnip> Where's you COME FROM
[0:26:37] <Valentinius_Anodyne> Framerate is a little better I think
[0:26:38] <%Quigsies> What is this? The Last of Us Part II
[0:26:39] <KingHyperbole> so is this like a fan made sequel or
[0:26:39] <jorniev> YORK INVENTING AIR FOR THE SECOND TIME
[0:26:45] <johndoe0920> Necklace of dog tails
[0:26:46] <+someguy1472> Mm. Chicken leaf.
[0:26:48] <dinnydanny777> Wow LOOK AT THAT INCREDIBLE FRAME RATE
[0:26:50] <%DappercatEsquire> there's like a million dogs here
[0:26:50] <%Garthunox> @kinghyperbole no
[0:26:52] <%NRHR_OTEN> Francis York Morgan's American Wasteland
[0:26:53] <stabbityrabbit> If this is post patch, does that mean this is the intended number of frames?
[0:26:53] <%GarbageQueenEllie> Skyrim wolves are hilariously weak
[0:26:55] <dinnydanny777> GivePLZ Frame Rate
[0:26:57] <SwipperSwap> YEAH make a stew witht hat dogs tail

[0:27:14] <%Dakuu75> DOG FUR?! so he SKINNED these dogs for their fur?! lol
[0:27:14] <%twistedj3ster> accuracy seems worse
[0:27:16] <amonimis> I can't believe they patched in another 3 frames
[0:27:16] <+WaifusSansFrontieres> did I miss anything?
[0:27:22] <+mckraven> @stabbityrabbit no they're gonna gradually improve it over time
[0:27:24] <%Garthunox> @kinghyperbole what's the problem? I see nothing wrong
[0:27:31] <amonimis> it's a whole 23 fps now!
[0:27:31] <+Eldith> Wish there was a upgrade for "stability"
[0:27:52] <+WaifusSansFrontieres> is performance better? as in the literal definition of the realtive term better
[0:27:52] <%TehMud> That's that GOOD framerate
[0:27:53] <Borkbiff > BorkBusters Inc over here
[0:27:56] <TrashbagZombie> One of those dogs was a tree!
[0:28:04] <+Skelegroove> York just grabs whatever nonsense is laying on the ground
[0:28:07] <%TheMattman1313> That's the DEEP SOUTH for ya
[0:28:09] <jorniev> these are like the coyotes form new vegas
[0:28:10] <%GarbageQueenEllie> too many cyotes
[0:28:10] <%cvp5127> well this is the DEEP SOUTH
[0:28:12] <wannabemoogle> I just imagine York skinning the dogs in front of Patty and it just ads to her list of weird shit York does
[0:28:13] <+someguy1472> The framerate looks passable in 2005 at least.
[0:28:14] <%Laecerelius> Watch out, Arisen! Wolves hunt in packs!
[0:28:14] <Gamer76255> Francis York Morgan, dog butcher
[0:28:14] <madskull456> floating grass
[0:28:18] <%Brogus_Almighty> york just annihilating the dog population
[0:28:23] <+someguy1472> I don't feel the switch dying.
[0:28:26] <%Dakuu75> there's something new to gawk at, every minutes, in this game

[0:35:52] <tranquilturnip> Maybe the Buildings have a lot of redundant geometry inside of them
[0:35:54] <%Laecerelius> the framerate is okay if you despawn most of the map

[1:04:44] <%ringabal> What an amazing video game
[1:04:44] <shieldecho> I am so late what did I miss
[1:04:46] <%cowardman93> York is a man of culture using the superior mode of transport
[1:04:49] <Guardiansaiyan> @Divryne for the lols
[1:04:53] <wibbwobbler> this dude is just pulled out his gun and started shooting the sky

[1:05:05] <SirDogBear> the solution makes it seem more janky but it works, Swery the genius PogChamp
[1:05:06] <KaitlynnHere> Because they’re rendering in the ENTIRE map instead of using inclusion rendering
[1:05:13] <%TehMud> No they're just spooky ghosts
[1:05:14] <%NRHR_OTEN> maybe you have to break stuff with the powerslide?
[1:05:19] <%cowardman93> it's not tearing asunder anymore
[1:05:20] <cureneckbeard> Mah boi, this peace is what all true warriors strive for!

[1:05:41] <jorniev> YORK IS GOING SO FAST
[1:05:44] <cureneckbeard> Remember when people said Pokemon Sword and Shield were bad because of the tree textures
[1:05:45] <%Typhaeon> Maybe if this was running on a Ryzen 9 and a 2080 Ti you'd get a whole 30 FPS
[1:05:45] <dinnydanny777> The NPCs disappear with the pop in but you can see the cars from miles away
[1:05:46] <%shadowace2400> also pat is in the game

[1:07:11] <KaitlynnHere> @neoripo by about two frames
[1:07:17] <%GarbageQueenEllie> I would not be surprised if these mofos straight up put cans of spinach in the drink machine
[1:07:23] <dukenux> and yeah, funnily enough, if you don't normally speak english, the way Pat pronounces "UFO" might be correct
[1:07:25] <+brightman42> noice

[1:07:55] <%cowardman93> umm... canned goods don't expire?
[1:07:58] <circular7> inflation is a bitch
[1:07:59] <boxman2222> notice the rendering distance of both the ufos and animals... no wonder frame rate is low

[1:08:06] <fuji_92> time to sleep for 2 days
[1:08:06] <ShichiNoBushi> It's in a can. It only matters if the can is swelling.

[1:08:08] <2DSuperiority> mmm vending machine donuts
[1:08:09] <+Moxhasan> hot canned spinach
[1:08:10] <Freeb0rne> That spinach would be 30 dollars in Greenvale.
[1:08:11] <%DappercatEsquire> @AnneSQF The spinach? I don't think so, pretty sure I got mine from the same vending machine.
[1:08:11] <%BLK_HRLQN_13> Thank you York
[1:08:15] <+KoryMccool> what
[1:08:16] <dukenux> It's canned spinach, it might expire after 5 years minimum
[1:08:16] <+Taglog7> DOORDASH
[1:08:16] <KaitlynnHere> @cowardman93 it depends
[1:08:18] <+Exicuren> Canned goods totally expire, but they take a lot
[1:08:19] <stabbityrabbit> Weren't the Clarksons the one getting off on dismemberment? I don't think they're in their right mind.
[1:08:21] <Daxalog> Does anybody ever get bottle cold coffee with the milk pre added. I always expect the worse
[1:08:22] <%UvBenServed> Texting Plague?
[1:08:23] <+worldbrand> I don't even know what you mean
[1:08:24] <star_feline> ResidentSleeper The Pickles waiting room
[1:08:25] <+RAAAAAINMAKER> Spinach is just steroids in a can
[1:08:25] <ha2ken> If you believe hard enough canned goods don't expire
[1:08:26] <cureneckbeard> Who in their right mind would frost a cake with their butt?
[1:08:26] <SirDogBear> If the Clarkson's have a food delivery service, couldn't York order these items for delivery somehow? CorgiDerp
[1:08:29] <+Neoripo> @KaitlynnHere Your answer came at the same moment the game froze to load the conversation LUL Talk about timing
[1:08:31] <DSD24> Hey Pat's where I am at
[1:08:32] <Valentinius_Anodyne> Yeah, it does so through the Morphogenetic Field
[1:08:36] <%StarlingSilence> same
[1:08:37] <AnneSQF> I got mine from a differnt one, on he other side of the river

[1:08:52] <+schlager087> York couldn't buy red beans and rice and must depression nap for 3 days... Same York, Same
[1:08:57] <%GarbageQueenEllie> When do we get to Clarkson's space-themed Mind Palace where the Bowling lady usurps all the screentime?
[1:08:58] <+Exicuren> doesn't canned spinach taste like shit?
[1:09:00] <%BLK_HRLQN_13> Sherif Department?
[1:09:04] <KaitlynnHere> QUIIIINT

[1:09:10] <%NRHR_OTEN> @Exicuren correct
[1:09:13] <dukenux> He is, and isn't at the police station, and the same time - Schrodinger's NPC
[1:09:20] <+TomServal> @cowardman93 Expired canned goods is how you get botulism.
[1:09:23] <%Tearonex> Is it me, or has the framerate improved a bit?
[1:09:24] <%CJett92> QUIIIIIIIIIIIIINT

[1:10:10] <%Typhaeon> Spam is amazing though
[1:10:12] <+alternative_flu> Normally cops protect and serve but this dude is only serving today
[1:10:13] <star_feline> Wait is this game sponsored by Spam ?
[1:10:13] <%Srthunda> that echo
[1:10:14] <%Typhaeon> Also that reverb LuL
[1:10:14] <%Starotter70> LORD

[1:10:30] <%AliceAstro> banter
[1:10:30] <+EySoyCoco> jesus fuck
[1:10:31] <MartwyPies> This game is so much like Yakuza, but without money
[1:10:32] <%NRHR_OTEN> naptiiiime
[1:10:33] <%miguelrod777> why do people echo when the say that
[1:10:35] <@SoFarFetched> is Melvin confirming that Tyrone gets EVERYONE to get him spam,red beans and spinach?
[1:10:35] <+KoryMccool> what is this church hazing nonesense
[1:10:35] <+EySoyCoco> its so bad
[1:10:35] <KaitlynnHere> Fuck yeah! Let’s buy pot from the cops
[1:10:43] <%Treuan> Being able to Echo on command sounds like a superpower
[1:10:47] <%GarbageQueenEllie> I hope Patti gets worried about your apparent lapse into depression on Monday
[1:10:50] <stabbityrabbit> NEW SNARF?
[1:10:52] <tegas_> Honestly I think this game looks pretty fun.
[1:10:52] <+Moxhasan> sleep in the graveyard with your sleeping bag
[1:10:54] <snowmanse> Make sure you eat so you don't starve to death while sleeping.
[1:10:58] <%toolofparanoia> No more snarfs?
[1:10:59] <%cowardman93> but the snarf ghosts still exist yes?
[1:11:00] <%Movemeister> Snarffff
[1:11:00] <vstpnv> man holy shit VA is so good for this game quality
[1:11:01] <+Taglog7> THE EVILS OF PREMARITAL SEX

[1:11:14] <+schlager087> @snowmanse that's just real life advice
[1:11:18] <star_feline> ResidentSleeper
[1:11:24] <+worldbrand> i havent been here in a while and im less surprised to hear there are ghosts and more surprised to hear there are enemies
[1:11:24] <%AliceAstro> did u say g-g-ghost???
[1:11:27] <CappuccinoGuil> @snowmanse you can just nap again, it heals you LUL
[1:11:33] <%StaceMcGate> @PatStaresAt found a guide for sidequests in Deadly Premonition 2, want me to dm it to you?
[1:11:33] <%onlystrykerfan> onlystrykerfan subscribed at Tier 1. They've subscribed for 10 months! Keep up the good work Pat.
[1:11:35] <%GarbageQueenEllie> Yeah it's not great
[1:11:36] <Valdorick> Yeah, sleeping too long is awful
[1:11:41] <snowmanse> Pretty sure you died that way in the original
[1:11:41] <TastySammiches> big dehydrated
[1:11:42] <%SmoochSpider> Is it more ghost cars
[1:11:45] <%Dakuu75> yeah, get the "too-much-sleep" migraine sometimes
[1:11:47] <Zayasu> is the framerate improvement noticeable?
[1:11:52] <+Moxhasan> when I had the flu I slept for 2 days straight
[1:11:52] <star_feline> BIG cheat
[1:11:56] <KaitlynnHere> Yup, sleeping too much can make you feel exhausted
[1:11:56] <+Exicuren> You wake up tired AND hungry and after eating you want to go back to sleep
[1:11:58] <+Neoripo> no
[1:12:04] <%GarbageQueenEllie> Niiice
[1:12:05] <+KoryMccool> @Zayasu id say so
[1:12:11] <dukenux> yeah too much sleep might give you a headache
[1:12:11] <+Rotanimood> Friends do I want chicken or roast beef for lunch
[1:12:15] <%Laecerelius> OOOOH!

[1:12:20] <snowmanse> Hoping the trailer isn't delayed
[1:12:20] <ha2ken> Strem?
[1:12:21] <%arancet> you could just... not?
[1:12:23] <Valentinius_Anodyne> Huh, guess I'm not the only one who gets too-much-sleep migraines
[1:12:24] <Royalguard22> Dedication
[1:12:25] <Psyramics> know you don't, just wait for a video to come out later to summarize it
[1:12:25] <+Ominnous> you'll have plenty of time to memorize the guide during the load screens
[1:12:25] <%cowardman93> what's too much sleep? I'm lucky to get 5 hours
[1:12:27] <%Metballs> Just live in the UK it's noon, easy
[1:12:31] <DSD24> @Rotanimood Roast Beef sounds nice
[1:12:32] <+schlager087> Is there a sidequest where you have to travel backwards in a cornfield in the future to reach the past and burn down the first red tree
[1:12:33] <%aishman> @PatStaresAt I'll be up for sure dude.
[1:12:33] <PortableBoredom> You really don't need to wake up for mamorpaguh news dude

[1:15:14] <%Typhaeon> Fascinating
[1:15:18] <%Laecerelius> odd how sometimes the snarfers sometimes die in one hit and sometimes in two
[1:15:20] <Tucker0603> @patstaresat how did they manage to get the frame rate this bad?
[1:15:21] <+Moxhasan> so is there any explanation for these guys showing up??
[1:15:22] <%ringabal> It's just Orpheus
[1:15:28] <OneShotZombie> meanwhile: the neighboring family cowers in fear as their house is riddled with bullets
[1:15:29] <%Bane_Kaikyo> It's definitely SNAP instead of SNARFF
[1:15:30] <ShichiNoBushi> Excellent! Amazing! Fantastic!
[1:15:31] <CappuccinoGuil> TIME FOR CRAB
[1:15:36] <stabbityrabbit> What a disappointment. No SNARF on new guy.
[1:15:39] <tegas_> What would you rate the game if the framerate issues weren't a thing?
[1:15:54] <%arancet> Louisiana is famous for its snarf ghosts
[1:15:56] <+KoryMccool> the deep south would be much cooler with an exclipse esc night horor

[1:16:38] <%SharKinStereo> it'd be in that gray zone where it's not a bad game, but not a good game, so no one cares
[1:16:46] <Leninade93> time for some red beans and rice

[1:24:20] <%ringabal> Considering what we've seen York do in DP1, I wouldn't doubt it

[1:34:48] <%toolofparanoia> Hell yeah!
[1:34:52] <%Poncho_Freestyle> I'm finna go crazy with a rifle if York doesn't shut up
[1:34:52] <tbprimeminister> @d4n5t3p You’re right. Not sure what came over me
[1:34:53] <%Dementedpenguin> JESUS, I forgot the cast of that movie LUL
[1:34:54] <dinnydanny777> York is just a movie memelord
[1:35:02] <%AliceAstro> ty swery
[1:35:03] <dinnydanny777> I bet York thinks The Room is art
[1:35:04] <Joustar_> Anaconda was the best/worst
[1:35:06] <%Chichen> @PatStaresAt it says "PARK" on the quest
[1:35:08] <Valentinius_Anodyne> I thought this movie was non-fiction when I was young, and because of that I thought Anacondas were found in Antarctica
[1:35:10] <%DappercatEsquire> I think it might, but not exactly
[1:35:10] <%toolofparanoia> god i love this pop culture shit!
[1:35:12] <%Jack_of_No_Trades> I love that Swery knows who Ice Cube is
[1:35:12] <snowmanse> The quest location tells you the park
[1:35:12] <%StaceMcGate> @PatStaresAt there is a hint in the quest title
[1:35:12] <Zayasu> :)
[1:35:13] <%JamesOriharaX> it does, it says PARK under the goal section
[1:35:15] <%RueOrin> Is it Pat? Is ANYTHING in this game unbelievable?
[1:35:18] <%Typhaeon> Happy to both reinforce and test your sanity Pat
[1:35:18] <dinnydanny777> When does York talk about The Room
[1:35:21] <D4N5T3P> LUL
[1:35:21] <%Chichen> you're welcome :)
[1:35:23] <%Dakuu75> PPL only remember that movie because the snake ate and barfed a guy up
[1:35:23] <%maskofmichael> The game thinks you're smarter then you really are
[1:35:25] <%driemen> driemen subscribed with Twitch Prime. They've subscribed for 14 months, currently on a 2 month streak! Hi Pat monthly question time: what's the weirdest food combination you're a slut for? Much love pet the baby
[1:35:27] <boxman2222> yeah it said park
[1:35:30] <FG_Leo106> Aris almost gave up playing this last night lmao
[1:35:40] <%Nupinoop296> no thanks, bro!
[1:35:40] <%coreyyotto> I can't believe York knows Majima
[1:35:40] <dan_g_v> take your compliment, chat!
[1:35:44] <+Neoripo> Not wrong
[1:35:45] <stabbityrabbit> Clearly you'd just ask Nicki Minaj about anacondas normally.
[1:35:45] <%Poncho_Freestyle> Anaconda skins are aquired through skinning anacondas :)
[1:35:47] <%Typhaeon> Isn't he wearing patent leather shoes
[1:35:48] <star_feline> I would :)
[1:35:48] <BallerSwagBro9k> Straight Facts
[1:35:50] <+ChiefWilly> yeah hunters are murderers, truth
[1:35:51] <snowmanse> All the gear in this game is made from animal bones you've killed
[1:35:51] <%Dakuu75> that's... kind of true
[1:35:52] <%BLK_HRLQN_13> Shots Fired
[1:35:53] <+ChiefWilly> Kappa
[1:35:53] <+Manjove> Anaconda's arent people York
[1:35:55] <+NickNackProductions> what a beautiful face
[1:35:55] <mistermastergreg> is York growing less insane with age? how would a early 20's York act?
[1:36:00] <cureneckbeard> I bet he's wearing leather shoes though. Cow slavery is ok
[1:36:02] <XatheFlare> why is pat playing a ps2 game in 2020
[1:36:06] <%Jack_of_No_Trades> on the verge?
[1:36:06] <Gamer76255> But York, you turn pieces of animals into voodoo charms and use them to make yourself stronger
[1:36:08] <%Nupinoop296> on the verge, not already there
[1:36:13] <%Dakuu75> yay, ADDICTION~!

[1:50:07] <%ClericOfSparda> Did Mr. Blip post that somewhere? I want to see it again
[1:50:08] <+Exicuren> Totally unrealistic, that animation had TOO MUCH frames per second
[1:50:09] <%MechArch> the level of effort you expect. nothing more, nothing less
[1:50:20] <%Typhaeon> It'll shift pitch when you're in low latency mode and Twitch is trying to catch up after buffering
[1:50:29] <%Typhaeon> Because it streams the video faster
[1:50:31] <Taranfeeto> Too much animation!
[1:50:37] <+Alopekis> Alopekis subscribed with Twitch Prime. They've subscribed for 11 months! 
[1:50:47] <KaitlynnHere> It’s funny, that animation had more frames than the game
[1:51:10] <Scotaku> I can't believe they managed to catch the same bit of lightning in another bottle with this game huh?
[1:51:31] <%barrakuta371> @Typhaeon Thanks for the explanation. The pitch just went back to normal.

[1:55:18] <%patriotrenegade> In one of the first documented cases of biological warfare, the mongols flung the bodies of their own soldier who had died of plague over the walls of cities that refused to surrender.
[1:55:50] <KaitlynnHere> @patriotrenegade how? They must’ve been high walls

[2:06:24] <CappuccinoGuil> y'all gonna see why
[2:06:25] <%Alopekis> Oh there's later issues
[2:06:27] <BallerSwagBro9k> YO PREACH ZACH
[2:06:27] <shieldecho> "Yes, I do hate this town, now that I know y'all are transphobic as shit"
[2:06:30] <Zebekis> Get York a fucking crown
[2:06:33] <hatty_> the patched stuff will have no voice lines so you'll know
[2:06:33] <%apolitenoob> HELL YEAH YORK
[2:06:34] <the_sprankton> if York hates this, he should hear what else they believe
[2:06:35] <+mckraven> this was original dialogue yes
[2:06:35] <bigshedman> So what was the actual offensive stuff?
[2:06:38] <+Taglog7> Yah, respect me for being a POS
[2:06:41] <Kuj999> Amen York

[2:06:51] <star_feline> You dropped your crown King
[2:06:55] <%Niney_Who> Deadnaming, yeah
[2:07:00] <CookieCutter007> LUL
[2:07:01] <%SirGO0SE> York, PrideCrown you dropped this
[2:07:03] <%Niney_Who> Thanks swery for Fixing that
[2:07:06] <%Niney_Who> Cause york a good boy
[2:07:06] <%CaptainPileDriver> it's because he keeps mislabeling them on and the such and swery didn't realize
[2:07:07] <%Slimshazbot> I heard the fix didn't really fix it much, but I don't know for sure
[2:07:07] <Djinnazz> so the probelm is??
[2:07:08] <%Starotter70> Ah, yeah
[2:07:08] <BallerSwagBro9k> TransgenderPride TransgenderPride TransgenderPride TransgenderPride TransgenderPride
[2:07:08] <%Grimlockfly> the offensive stuff is the rest of the game
[2:07:10] <$vincerocmm> its an interagshion damnit
[2:07:12] <%silverira> what
[2:07:12] <KaitlynnHere> Yeah York might need to brush up on his southern history lesson
[2:07:12] <Aydarkzero> hmm
[2:07:16] <bigshedman> Aaaaaaaaaaah ok. Seems like an honest mistake then, good on him for fixing it.
[2:07:17] <%DappercatEsquire> It's a of deadnaming, because Lena did shit before identifying as Lena
[2:07:19] <%CaptainPileDriver> but swery did and fixed it
[2:07:21] <tranquilturnip> its also possible that language barriers caused confusion
[2:07:25] <BallerSwagBro9k> HSCheers HSCheers HSCheers HSCheers HSCheers
[2:07:27] <CappuccinoGuil> FYI, He still deadnames Helena throughout the game. That wasn't patched
[2:07:30] <Gutsandlove> Swery da best
[2:07:31] <%Alopekis> Aaaah. Got it.
[2:07:34] <+BIumen> was Lena perhaps Lenny
[2:07:35] <%cowardman93> okay, could've been far worse
[2:07:36] <%Slimshazbot> Honestly York looks better shaven
[2:07:37] <+KoryMccool> oh god
[2:07:37] <Aydarkzero> that might actually be the first time i saw York upset
[2:07:38] <+shearsss> definitely possible

[2:07:44] <%barrakuta371> Hwahwahwa
[2:07:45] <+Moxhasan> so what was patched exactly?
[2:07:45] <%Typhaeon> No wait, Forrest Whittaker
[2:07:47] <Gallhint> Wouldn't deadnaming matter in an investigatory sense? Like if it had to be solely for solving a criminal matter, or is there no leighway whatsoever?
[2:07:47] <+linSP> deadnaming is an honest mistake if you didn’t know

[2:08:11] <%Laecerelius> Drink the hooch, York!
[2:08:12] <Blank9> It's mostly that he's talking about her before transition by her name she had then.
[2:08:12] <%nimu290> i didnt know deadnaming was a thing until this myself
[2:08:14] <CappuccinoGuil> At least this load was fast, unlike the previous Hougan scene at the bowling alley lol

[2:27:34] <stabbityrabbit> YO IS SHE A WITCH?
[2:27:35] <BallerSwagBro9k> THIS VA DUBS JOSUKE IN PART 4
[2:27:36] <FiftyFiveP> How is this even problematic
[2:27:38] <%coreyyotto> Maybe she knows because everyone talks about the FBI agent who goes around talking to himself
[2:27:39] <%hzealot> she is
[2:27:40] <benjehuda> A flaming homer!
[2:27:41] <%tigerfang86> FeelsBadMan

[2:27:58] <jorniev> MAGIC WITH YOUR DRINKS
[2:27:59] <%Ninestempest> @FiftyFiveP just wait lol
[2:28:00] <johnnumbas> why is it an issue if a man voices a trans character? women generally voice children even if they're boys
[2:28:01] <%RyTYoung> oh hey just joined, not met this character yet since watching!
[2:28:04] <wannabemoogle> OH I think I get it
[2:28:05] <heartlesshealer> if you inhale fire into your lungs you die instantly
[2:28:05] <%GarbageNirvana> She's rather forthcoming about that
[2:28:10] <Spiralpower1620> this is also Maruki
[2:28:12] <BallerSwagBro9k> Takuto Maruki
[2:28:17] <%Nupinoop296> you odnt know that york
[2:28:20] <heartlesshealer> if you get pushed into a bonfire never inhale if you scream
[2:28:21] <AFlyingTaco1> Oh boy
[2:28:25] <%PettyFunk> York they don't have to kill you to mistreat you
[2:28:29] <%ringabal> WAIT

[2:28:41] <FiftyFiveP> OH SHIT
[2:28:42] <VioletHeart> Oh no she's cute.
[2:28:45] <CappuccinoGuil> @hzealot because her experience as trans is being told by a man, who doesn't know it. It's like a white actor portraying racism
[2:28:46] <jorniev> IS SHE A A CLARCKSON!?
[2:28:47] <%cvp5127> per-sona

[2:52:00] <KaitlynnHere> Snaaaarf
[2:52:02] <%ringabal> IS THAT QUINT
[2:52:06] <+KoryMccool> is that how that works
[2:52:10] <@SoFarFetched> @DestroPrime83 First game's combat was pretty much like this too. There was a Side quest where you can get a wrench that just one shots everything.
[2:52:14] <+krispen_wa> Zach is...SPOILERS
[2:52:19] <dinnydanny777> How does that look like a suicide attempt
[2:52:23] <DSD24> @BoomerTiro I mean its plot relevant who Zach is
[2:52:27] <KaitlynnHere> @boomertiro sorta. It’s his dead brother
[2:52:32] <%Laecerelius> Many donut
[2:52:35] <sleepy_pixels> obra inn
[2:52:37] <Gorgs7> jesus, I've never looked at these games, and from the last 30 seconds, I'm soo glad
[2:52:40] <dinnydanny777> Zack is from Gongaga
[2:52:54] <HitchhikingThrough> M E ?
[2:52:55] <ultimate_joker_main> @KaitlynnHere not his brother
[2:52:56] <%tigerfang86> Me?
[2:52:57] <%afronooch> Me? Gongaga
[2:52:57] <+BoomerTiro> @DSD24 @KaitlynnHere Nice, i love it.
[2:52:58] <%tigerfang86> gongaga
[2:53:03] <@SoFarFetched> @BoomerTiro Zach is the real person, while York is actually his Imaginary friend. The brother thing is wrong.
[2:53:06] <%derekwst3> zack is baba
[2:53:06] <+teslaclesdeviant_> no zach is the original personality, york is literally cope
[2:53:11] <3viltiki> jeezus!

[2:53:48] <+spoopy24> is that morpheus :o
[2:53:48] <dukenux> Lena looks cool
[2:53:52] <+krispen_wa> Is that Grigori from Dragon's Dogma?
[2:53:56] <KaitlynnHere> @ultimate_joker_main who is he then?
[2:53:57] <bigshedman> @The_Maddness got cancelled I think, dunno if the Kickstarter ever got refunded.
[2:54:10] <%PipIV> I say'uh
[2:54:14] <@SoFarFetched> @BoomerTiro Yeah pretty much the first game explains why Zach becomes the person in the head and York is the one controlling,because a traumatic event happens that causes York to be the dominant person.
[2:54:17] <HitchhikingThrough> Subtle
[2:54:28] <dinnydanny777> Did York say this looked like a suicide attempt
[2:54:41] <%GarbageNirvana> The Clarksons were slave owners weren't they
[2:54:43] <jorniev> HOW DOES YORK NOW THIS
[2:54:46] <dukenux> that's just our budget, York
[2:54:48] <samura1_queen19> Is Lena Pattie’s mom?
[2:54:49] <%SirGO0SE> gangsta stance
[2:54:53] <balquisa> they all have lever actions and revolvers
[2:54:54] <%tigerfang86> York's just a badass
[2:54:55] <CursedNobleman> what mooks LUL
[2:54:59] <+krispen_wa> York can solo 5 dudes with guns somehow
[2:55:00] <KaitlynnHere> @garbagenirvana we don’t talk about that
[2:55:03] <The_Maddness> @dinnydanny777 yeah, she rand into a room full of people with guns who want to shoot her
[2:55:06] <the_sprankton> @dinnydanny777 I think he meant it was suicide for Lena to go in there without backup
[2:55:10] <%GarbageQueenEllie> Everybody gangsta until the tree demons come
[2:55:12] <DestroPrime83> Lever Action pat
[2:55:12] <+xTheAngryDwarfx> Lol the guy with a knife

[2:58:27] <TurtlesAndTentacles> so... they couldn't get a lady... they asked Yuri to do it? that's a weird choice
[2:58:30] <dukenux> 4Head
[2:58:31] <AFlyingTaco1> We saw how that went in the last game, Lena. Not great.
[2:58:34] <%spongeofmystery> BUT THE PATRIOTS WOULD DENY ME EVEN THAT
[2:58:40] <@SoFarFetched> @samura1_queen19 "was their son" now his daughter.
[2:58:41] <trfurkanrey18> @mule4242 ye as @sofarfetched said the dialogue is loveable jankines but tech wise its lacking way too much with frames and such

[2:59:21] <%G_Thunders> @turtlesandtentacles Lena is a trans woman so...idk if what you said was bait though lol

[2:59:24] <jorniev> POWER OF GUN
[2:59:25] <%BioHunter> i think one bullet wouldve been enough
[2:59:28] <Death_by_moogle> IT WAS A FIRE FIGHT!
[2:59:28] <Idon__> what is happening
[2:59:35] <mattdel92> Pip pip pop
[2:59:39] <dinnydanny777> Does he have his eye patch?
[2:59:40] <%Typhaeon> Unlike every other gunshot apparently
[2:59:40] <dukenux> wait, Lena is Prof R?
[2:59:41] <Idon__> I'm mad confused
[2:59:44] <dinnydanny777> Is this how he lost his eye?
[2:59:48] <%PipIV> it was a fucking ambush
[2:59:51] <stabbityrabbit> @XeroSigmaPrime I think it's in kinda poor taste to have a cis man voice a trans woman. Especially since the vocal direction doesn't seem all that feminine for her.
[2:59:53] <AFlyingTaco1> @dukenux Yes
[2:59:53] <jorniev> did she jon wick them!?
[2:59:53] <Guardiansaiyan> @dukenux yes
[2:59:56] <CappuccinoGuil> @dukenux yes
[3:00:02] <BallerSwagBro9k> This is strangely Persona-ish rn
[3:00:03] <mattdel92> Is that...Jonathan Frakes?!?!
[3:00:04] <3viltiki> What if it was one guy with six guns?
[3:00:06] <dukenux> ok
[3:00:10] <%GarbageNirvana> Turns out Lena's VA also played Takuto in P5R
[3:00:13] <ultimate_joker_main> @mattdel92 no
[3:00:16] <@SoFarFetched> @G_Thunders Having certain people voice certain characters is a very messy thing to deal with. Since there are many who will agree/disagree on who voices who.
[3:00:17] <+D00msDayDan> it must be patty
[3:00:18] <trfurkanrey18> what the hell is a cis man
[3:00:18] <jackeroff3> I mean I've heard trans women that sound like that
[3:00:19] <BaslerJones> maybe its the cop
[3:00:22] <CappuccinoGuil> @dinnydanny777 no, this just happened, PJ already doesn't have his eye
[3:00:23] <vaderxyz1970> But why just Louisiana?
[3:00:27] <%GarbageQueenEllie> Well, she sure ain't fertile now, AYOOO

[3:00:36] <star_feline> DEEP SOUTH
[3:00:36] <KaitlynnHere> @stabbityrabbit which it probably would be more feminine, especially if she’s taking hormones
[3:00:41] <Idon__> cis means they identify with the gender they were given at birth
[3:00:41] <Kuj999> That would be something

[3:01:38] <ultimate_joker_main> don't you love when the camera clips inside York's head and you see his eyeballs
[3:01:40] <%PipIV> and the snarfs start coming and they don't stop coming
[3:01:43] <trfurkanrey18> huh thanks for the heads up but trans people tend to sound like that often so its pretty much reflective of real life
[3:01:46] <+lethallunacyx> Like why?
[3:01:48] <%weissguard> SNARRFFF
[3:01:51] <%TheDewdHole> Snarf Souls LUL
[3:01:52] <+KoryMccool> @Stonebeard pls i beg you no
[3:01:56] <mattdel92> Seriously...thats the noise they make
[3:01:59] <%Laecerelius> Snarf this, fucko!
[3:01:59] <dukenux> All the snarfs inside my he-ead
[3:02:02] <+krispen_wa> Ah, you were at my side all along, my true mentor...my guiding SNAAAAARF
[3:02:03] <jorniev> shooting up these ghosts
[3:02:07] <%weissguard> SNARRFFF SNARRFFF
[3:02:07] <%Typhaeon> Actors don't have to embody every trait of the characters they play. That's why it's called "acting"
[3:02:08] <+teslaclesdeviant_> not really?
[3:02:09] <fuji_92> SCARF PogChamp
[3:02:14] <@SoFarFetched> @XeroSigmaPrime @stabbityrabbit The voice casting is definitely a slippery slope to talk about. Since many have their agreements/disagreements on who should voice certain characters.
[3:02:16] <fuji_92> *snarf
[3:02:17] <%PipIV> TELL ME WHY? Ain't nuthin' but a SNAAAARF
[3:02:18] <CappuccinoGuil> @XeroSigmaPrime if the character is trans, they should be portrayed by a trans person. They already struggle with opportunities. Besides, it'd be more genuine in the writing process
[3:02:22] <%alcors_wisdom> what are these demon souls monster closets
[3:02:23] <%GarbageQueenEllie> @XeroSigmaPrime pretty good point. I personally don't mind it
[3:02:27] <+krispen_wa> Give it to me, that thing, your SNAAAAARF
[3:02:29] <+Neoripo> Snaaaaaarf!
[3:02:33] <Profmcstevie> I don't know what I love more, the line itself or the clear cut off at the end
[3:02:34] <dukenux> Deadly Premonition 2 is the first game in the Snarf genre
[3:02:50] <%SvenHolgersson> SNARRRRRRRRRF
[3:02:51] <SocialMisfitGamer> So how's York these days @PatStaresAt
[3:02:57] <+teslaclesdeviant_> are you sure there wasnt a thundercats game
[3:02:59] <OtterExpress> hey everybody just woke up, did pat ever beat bowling?
[3:03:00] <Ranko2Danko> this song is so good man, how do they keep doing it
[3:03:01] <+krispen_wa> The S in SNAAAAARF stands for STRAAAAND
[3:03:03] <+LandOfTheWay> so are these the equivalent of the woodsman from twin peaks?
[3:03:07] <%weissguard> SNARRFFF
[3:03:11] <%Typhaeon> Classic paralysis effect
[3:03:16] <%weissguard> @OtterExpress Nope
[3:03:16] <SolsticeZro> the paralyze is worse than on a BLM in FF14
[3:03:20] <%GarbageQueenEllie> Dude if
[3:03:21] <+xTheAngryDwarfx> Snip dick?
[3:03:25] <%Typhaeon> Do more squats, it'll wear off quicker
[3:03:26] <jackeroff3> I'm snarf-gendered
[3:03:36] <trfurkanrey18> uhhh no? @cappuccinoguil talented people suited for the respective jobs should be chosen. if its a trans person so be it. but DO NOT choose them just because they are trans.
[3:03:37] <+toficque> whaa
[3:03:40] <dukenux> No, the creators of this game aren't familiar with Twin Peaks(or True Detective)
[3:03:40] <%XeroSigmaPrime> @SoFarFetched I completely agree. I just dont really understand the other viewpoint that someone needs to be characteristically the same as the person theyre acting as... Emphasis on the acting
[3:03:41] <$vincerocmm> wake up snarrrfff
[3:03:42] <dukenux> Kappa
[3:03:45] <koolastic1234> lprodGod lprodGod lprodGod lprodGod lprodGod lprodGod
[3:03:45] <%silverira> Are you paralyzed like in pokemon?
[3:03:47] <Cabbs_1> why do they SNAARF? why do they drop coffee?
[3:03:48] <+storebrandcandy> york is affected by thunderwave
[3:03:50] <BallerSwagBro9k> Pat might be a TAD overleveld
[3:03:54] <stabbityrabbit> @SoFarFetched Yeah, I think I'm willing to leave it at an agree to disagree thing. If it doesn't bother other people good for them. I'm certainly not gonna try and change minds in twitch chat.
[3:03:57] <+Jimboq> snip snip snip
[3:04:02] <CappuccinoGuil> @trfurkanrey18 you saying there are no talented trans actors?
[3:04:12] <SocialMisfitGamer> Look like we gotta SNARF out the problem
[3:04:12] <+lethallunacyx> Snarf gave crabs
[3:04:14] <+Estuko> hhhhhhhhhhh
[3:04:18] <%GarbageQueenEllie> snaaarf;lsajd;hfd;jsa;hgvd
[3:04:25] <Spiralpower1620> SNAAAAARF!
[3:04:26] <BallerSwagBro9k> GOT SNARF?
[3:04:29] <%PipIV> overleveled? Pat's been playing offscreen?
[3:04:30] <%apolitenoob> So he does squats when he's electrified, got it
[3:04:35] <StormingRLP> Example: Look at Matt Mercer. Dude, has an amazing amount voices under his belt including female characters
[3:04:35] <%Laecerelius> So there's snippy snarfers and door ghosts that summon snippy crabs
[3:04:36] <%alcors_wisdom> did they ever explain why the monstars carry scissors
[3:04:38] <CappuccinoGuil> @XeroSigmaPrime should a white person portray a black actor in a story about racism? Trans people should be hired and paid to tell their stories.
[3:04:39] <fuji_92> SNARF ME UP! I CAN'T SNARF UP! SNARF ME EEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEE!
[3:04:40] <TioXyco> why this music sounds so.... Metal Gear Solid 3?
[3:04:41] <bigshedman> Is the voice actor for SNARF an actual snarf?
[3:04:41] <dukenux> yea
[3:04:42] <+niknikmcsneakerton> nobody is saying find a random trans woman to voice act. obviously youd find and actor
[3:04:44] <BallerSwagBro9k> @PipIV Of course he has
[3:04:46] <%Typhaeon> Well this is clearly the last room
[3:04:47] <Valentinius_Anodyne> Yeah, it's pretty snarfed up
[3:04:50] <%spongeofmystery> You remember when the original Deadly P had terrible combat so the Director's Cut made it super easy instead and it was a huge improvement?
[3:04:51] <%doc_ock_rokc> @CappuccinoGuil No thats stupid, Some of the best VA works in history are people not even portraying their own race sex or gender, By your own metric tons of people would be out of a job and you'd never see your representation because you want to enforce segregation
[3:04:55] <%tigerfang86> SNAR SNA SNARFFFFF
[3:04:56] <SolsticeZro> yeah +6 power is really busted
[3:04:59] <SirDogBear> a pile of snarfs there PogChamp
[3:04:59] <PastaL> Yeah, let's cast white men in all roles. Black people, women, children, cats, dogs. All of 'em.
[3:05:03] <%Typhaeon> edit:fuck, not the last room
[3:05:04] <+lethallunacyx> Snarf me right in the hole
[3:05:06] <trfurkanrey18> @cappuccinoguil read my message again friend. I said if he talented person is trans so be it. But do not choose them just for 'diversity' points.
[3:05:07] <%XeroSigmaPrime> @CappuccinoGuil Men, women, chidlren already constantly cross roles. And thats only considering gender and age. Throw race into the mix and theres no such thing as "You need someone of the same race to accurately protray the character"
[3:05:16] <%ringabal> You really want the Switch to try processing DP puzzles?
[3:05:16] <%juxtest> Load up load up load up with rubber bullets
[3:05:23] <@SoFarFetched> Guys lets not get too into this Voice Casting discussion. Since this may cause some people to be heated and make things worse.
[3:05:24] <+krispen_wa> Twitch chat truly is the SNAAARF
[3:05:26] <+professormorrigan> why is pat so powerful
[3:05:39] <Cabbs_1> clowns
[3:05:39] <the_sprankton> those barrels have a very small blast radius
[3:05:39] <AnneSQF> *psycho rubber bullets
[3:05:44] <%walternatorz> they're actually protesters and journalists
[3:05:45] <%TheDewdHole> Rubber Ghost Bullets
[3:05:45] <+Dotta5> They got Pat's finger guns into the game?Q
[3:05:46] <%toolofparanoia> I japanese theater men used to portray women.
[3:05:50] <Idon__> paragraphs on one side, SNAAAARF on the other, twitch chat is beautiful
[3:05:52] <trfurkanrey18> @sofarfetched fair enough. I stand my case.
[3:05:53] <%Laecerelius> Pat has a +6 Strength gun
[3:05:53] <+Estuko> If it gets serious at least take the discussion to private messaging
[3:05:53] <Valentinius_Anodyne> Pat is powerful because he has embraced the Snarf
[3:05:54] <BallerSwagBro9k> @professormorrigan He snarfed off screen
[3:05:54] <%weissguard> SNARRFFF
[3:05:54] <KaitlynnHere> Yeah let’s stop before someone’s feelings are hurt
[3:05:58] <PastaL> Imo, York's va should just voice all the characters. He's so good at accents.
[3:06:02] <%GarbageQueenEllie> SoFarFetched is correct, we should be focusing on the fact that SNAAARF is being overused
[3:06:06] <%alcors_wisdom> rubber bullets are made from ghost dinosuars of course they would be effective
[3:06:08] <mattdel92> Dont hurt feefees
[3:06:09] <ミュウレ4242> there are no voice acting job openings. they go to the friends and family of producers.
[3:06:10] <+astrofizzix> You think the combat is easy now? Just wait until Pat unlocks the magnum offscreen.
[3:06:14] <+WaifusSansFrontieres> the anime dub industry might run into some issues then
[3:06:14] <CappuccinoGuil> This isn't the place to discuss this after all, but in conclusion: hire trans people to tell trans stories.
[3:06:16] <TurtlesAndTentacles> damn... I'm sorry I brought it up... I was genuinely confused since I missed alot of the story...
[3:06:18] <+krispen_wa> SNAAAARF isn't being used enough
[3:06:18] <%Robot_Nixon_> atpRtsd1 atpRtsd2 ITS TIME
[3:06:19] <%Robot_Nixon_> atpRtsd3 atpRtsd4 FOR SNARFF
[3:06:19] <dukenux> ZAP
[3:06:22] <FiftyFiveP> @PatStaresAt how would you rate combat versus DP1?
[3:06:23] <+KoryMccool> LUL
[3:06:25] <+LandOfTheWay> LUL
[3:06:25] <%toolofparanoia> York playing every character lol
[3:06:26] <%XeroSigmaPrime> @CappuccinoGuil NEVER said that Trans actors shouldnt get jobs. Infact, they should be allowed to go for any jobs, not JUST trans roles/
[3:06:28] <%Typhaeon> Snarf is over
[3:06:28] <SolsticeZro> LUL
[3:06:33] <%PipIV> Mam? everybody's got SNARF and shit
[3:06:33] <candidateplays> These guys seem way weaker than the shadows in DP1. York needed an SMG, a magnum, a shotgun, a flamethrower and a lightsaber for those guys.
[3:06:33] <@SoFarFetched> Like honestly if people want to continue the voice casting discussion. That's fine as long as it's DM'd.
[3:06:34] <BallerSwagBro9k> NotLikeThis NotLikeThis NotLikeThis
[3:06:35] <+lethallunacyx> Turns out it was snarf the whole time
[3:06:36] <jorniev> MR SNIP SNIP!
[3:06:37] <+HeathCottengim> bye snarf
[3:06:37] <KaitlynnHere> @mattdel92 sometimes I forget some people don’t have any
[3:06:40] <mattdel92> @cappuccinoguil Nope
[3:06:40] <%Laecerelius> Going into a boss fight with a status effect?
[3:06:41] <%Robot_Nixon_> Were we the SNARFF all along?
[3:06:41] <%XeroSigmaPrime> @SoFarFetched Sorry didnt see your mesaage till now
[3:06:43] <%PipIV> Man
[3:06:43] <+RowenCleric> Snarf is never over

[3:12:49] <%TheDewdHole> Need to change the stream title to "Pat Snarfs At Deadly Premonition 2"
[3:12:53] <+krispen_wa> I will pay Swery 5 bucks to put SNAAAARF in every game from now on
[3:12:57] <bluefooddye1> Why porcelain clowns with garden shears though?

[3:13:23] <%AliceAstro> the greatness
[3:13:25] <dukenux> psaCrazyhand
[3:13:25] <bluebiscuit94> I want DP3 to either be fresh-faced young York in the 90's or a contemporary story with a successor, either Patty or Aliya
[3:13:25] <%Stonebeard> Fingerbang these clowns to death, Pa
[3:13:28] <Spiralpower1620> have it be York's grandchildren
[3:13:28] <CursedNobleman> man, mardi gras is a trip
[3:13:29] <KaitlynnHere> I really wish they didn’t leave out the bit about the family used to own slaves. Like they paint the family as bad and devious but leave out the worst part.
[3:13:32] <AnneSQF> remember you can dodge
[3:13:33] <%GarbageQueenEllie> @Guardiansaiyan Dammit, it's already begun!

[3:16:10] <+toficque> fear of circumcision
[3:16:16] <DSD24> @Chester_goes_Berserk @KaitlynnHere I figured that's what they represented
[3:16:19] <%alcors_wisdom> reminds me how in xenblade chronicles the gaurd enemies would constantly yell "dont forget me" till they patched it out
[3:16:22] <PastaL> I think they spotted you. Hide, quick
[3:16:23] <3viltiki> nice shootin' Tex
[3:16:23] <%TheDewdHole> Oh a tripple snarf combo, very good Pat

[3:16:34] <%StaceMcGate> I need more snarf
[3:16:36] <%astrofalcon1> sup
[3:16:36] <DSD24> @alcors_wisdom Think you can take me!
[3:16:43] <%Typhaeon> Glory to Aeryglyph
[3:16:44] <%Stonebeard> Smokin Sick Snarf
[3:16:45] <+RowenCleric> we need a stream notification that is Snarf
[3:16:46] <star_feline> The enemies in this game represents York's fear of circumcisions
[3:16:47] <%StarlingSilence> after this york can go to a restaurant and order a snarf 'n' tarf
[3:16:49] <%Typhaeon> or was it airy, i dunno
[3:16:51] <%astrofalcon1> wait what's with the good frame rate
[3:16:52] <%XeroSigmaPrime> THINK YOU CAN TAKE ME?!
[3:16:59] <SilverBrass> Remember when the monsters were the souls of past drug users trapped in hellish limbo?
[3:17:02] <%alcors_wisdom> @DSD24 "lets show them a thing or three"
[3:17:12] <+professormorrigan> O SNARF
[3:17:16] <lennonbad> Looks like a game to get... when it's on discount
[3:17:23] <%californaya> ???????
[3:17:24] <tranquilturnip> and it was BEAUTIFUL
[3:17:24] <PastaL> Smaller rooms means better framerate
[3:17:24] <+DinnerCalzone> LUL
[3:17:26] <Valdorick> I SAW IT
[3:17:26] <%PipIV> I SEEN IT
[3:17:26] <%Typhaeon> These monsters would stop coming back if York were using lethal rounds
[3:17:27] <stabbityrabbit> @PettyFunk Oh my god you hear it too?! I thought I was going crazy.
[3:17:27] <%ToneBacas> you mean half a second
[3:17:27] <%astrofalcon1> PogChamp
[3:17:27] <DSD24> @alcors_wisdom "We will beat them with the power of friendship!"
[3:17:28] <@SoFarFetched> we were given 60 FPS....as a treat.
[3:17:31] <sssoapy> woolieGASM
[3:17:32] <%walternatorz> I don't think that works like that
[3:17:34] <%Laecerelius> So it was 30 FPS
[3:17:35] <%Starotter70> 60 frames in 1!? PogChamp
[3:17:35] <tranquilturnip> 60fps for half a frame doesn't make sense tho
[3:17:37] <+pynkdoe> i was there :)
[3:17:38] <+HeathCottengim> i refuse to believe
[3:17:38] <%XeroSigmaPrime> Im offended by the SEVERE under-utilization of Snarf
[3:17:42] <+slickrick1121> this music is amazing
[3:17:44] <%Stonebeard> 60fps for half a second means it's a 30 fps game
[3:17:45] <%vaporousTippler> So technically the game has unlocked fps.
[3:17:48] <tranquilturnip> @SoFarFetched we can't get complacent of course
[3:17:48] <mattdel92> Wouldnt that be 30 frames???
[3:17:48] <Leninade93> it's so much more cinematic in the open world though
[3:17:49] <star_feline> york can have little a framerate
[3:17:50] <%PipIV> we can have a little a 60
[3:17:54] <%ringabal> Oh framerate dimension, you can be a real tease
[3:17:54] <%StaceMcGate> two of them didn't say snarf
[3:17:59] <+lethallunacyx> Can't SNARF won't SNARF
[3:18:01] <+teslaclesdeviant_> it was 30 frames a half second
[3:18:02] <%TheDewdHole> Now theyre the souls of people trapped in the snarf dimension
[3:18:05] <+teslaclesdeviant_> learn ratios nerds
[3:18:08] <%alcors_wisdom> @DSD24 "i wont hold back"
[3:18:08] <+VERDAXY> BOY I TEL,L YOU WHAT
[3:18:14] <%ToneBacas> we went 60 MPH for 1 mile
[3:18:17] <%BLK_HRLQN_13> Imagine if the reward for beating the game was to get a solid 60fps
[3:18:19] <DSD24> These crabs are on LOCK
[3:18:22] <PastaL> It's actually 31 frames because there's one frame in the other half a second
[3:18:28] <%XeroSigmaPrime> @teslaclesdeviant_ So isnt that the same as 60fps?
[3:18:30] <%Robot_Nixon_> this is still more interesting that TLOU2 atpRtsd
[3:18:32] <Scotaku> Why are the ghosts of carnival performers haunting the otherworld in Le Carre?
[3:18:33] <+Ominnous> look at all this antinumb we will never use
[3:18:36] <%PipIV> 60fps UNLOCKED FOR NEW GAME
[3:18:38] <+chattychocobo> !uptime
[3:18:38] <@Moobot> I've been playing this game for how long? Oh only 3h 18m.
[3:18:40] <DSD24> @alcors_wisdom Xenoblade 2 was a good game
[3:18:41] <%PettyFunk> Big n Tall Snarf
[3:18:46] <%StaceMcGate> Will he scream snarf?
[3:18:47] <+teslaclesdeviant_> yes thats the point
[3:18:51] <+chattychocobo> oh fuck im super late for DP time
[3:18:56] <%astrofalcon1> 60 fps should be an unlock for beating the game
[3:18:56] <%ringabal> Are the scissor and chain demons supposed to be a metaphor for sexual identity?
[3:18:59] <SilverBrass> Nah, the boss is the exec behind Thundercats Ho
[3:19:00] <%Niney_Who> The PJ stands for Snarf
[3:19:01] <%alcors_wisdom> @DSD24 hell yeah it was i should play the dlc at some point
[3:19:05] <%astrofalcon1> just to show off
[3:19:07] <%cvp5127> will he be shirtless?
[3:19:08] <+storebrandcandy> the devil went down to georgia, lookin' for a SNARF to steal
[3:19:08] <StormingRLP> Why does your PJ Clarkson sound like President Shinra from FF7 Machinabridged???
[3:19:09] <%TheDewdHole> I'm more invested with Lena than I ever was with Abby
[3:19:12] <Scotaku> P.J. Clarkson's boss fight will just be him in Virgil's coat.
[3:19:14] <%PettyFunk> PJ Snarfson
[3:19:14] <AnneSQF> here we go.....
[3:19:15] <%XeroSigmaPrime> @teslaclesdeviant_ OH lol, i thought you were acting like they were different like everyone else
[3:19:15] <3viltiki> what if PJ Clarkson's final form is just PJ from Goof Troop?
[3:19:18] <%Stonebeard> PJ stands for Pajamas
[3:19:20] <%PipIV> @chattychocobo Do you have an excuse or will we have to mark you tardy?
[3:19:27] <+slickrick1121> yiiiiikkkkesssss
[3:19:27] <DSD24> @alcors_wisdom Torna was a good DLC you totally should
[3:19:32] <%XeroSigmaPrime> @TheDewdHole TRUE
[3:19:35] <PastaL> Pajama Sam Clarkson
[3:19:36] <%californaya> PJ stands for Pandjopb

[3:25:59] <%weissguard> @SoFarFetched 0/10 game.
[3:26:01] <Pnutz409> the anti spooky.
[3:26:03] <AnneSQF> press the left joystick to snarf
[3:26:03] <+xTheAngryDwarfx> I think the real question is who voices the snarf people
[3:26:05] <+Chester_goes_Berserk> is SNAARF meant to be "Francis" backwards?
[3:26:05] <KaitlynnHere> @sofarfetched d...did they?
[3:26:09] <+zepelinnn1> they wont
[3:26:11] <DSD24> and new music

[3:26:15] <@SoFarFetched> @KaitlynnHere no that's why I put it in quotes LUL
[3:26:20] <%StarlingSilence> but who snarfs the snarfmen?
[3:26:20] <PastaL> I hope these areas get a different snarf
[3:26:21] <%TheDewdHole> Hello Snarfness my old friend

[3:26:24] <Profmcstevie> Are you suggesting MORE assets Pat? NEVER
[3:26:25] <%sporeian94> Are they saying Snow?
[3:26:27] <+storebrandcandy> we demand more SNARF
[3:26:28] <@SoFarFetched> as a "what if"
[3:26:29] <SolsticeZro> the otherworld is so boring aside from the story sections
[3:26:30] <UndeadManatee> all the shoot bits in the game look the same
[3:26:34] <+chattychocobo> i want to get an autograph from the dude that voices the snarf demons
[3:26:35] <KaitlynnHere> @sofarfetched you got me there
[3:26:39] <dinnydanny777> The Snarf of Us

[3:26:44] <+smevvster> Man I dunno about the direction they took Silent Hills. You sure Del Toro was a good call?
[3:26:45] <Valentinius_Anodyne> I hope this comes to PC so the game can be modded for more SNARF
[3:26:45] <%StaceMcGate> Snarf must be a code word for something
[3:26:46] <+nikoninja19> riviting gameplay :P
[3:26:47] <%XeroSigmaPrime> I think DP! does these sequences FAR better
[3:26:51] <%Bailey__gaming> did that ghost just snarf?
[3:26:51] <DSD24> The Wall
[3:26:59] <Pnutz409> @chester_goes_berserk I'm pretty sure it is!!!

[3:28:05] <%Typhaeon> Evil Gaben fight

[3:28:30] <Blank9> the raincoat killer

[3:28:32] <elicoy> I Have No Mouth And I Must SNARF
[3:28:32] <Spiralpower1620> I remember the boss fight with the axe murderer and him LITERALLY TURNING INTO ONI AKUMA cmonBruh
[3:28:33] <sssoapy> Wasn't the combat a studio mandate and it sucked balls
[3:28:36] <+krispen_wa> That creep ass crawly lady that looked like she was from the Ring
[3:28:38] <%maenos2> man you said the first time you played DP its what made you quit

[3:28:59] <mattdel92> Snarfway to heaven
[3:29:03] <PastaL> Voice director was Ed Wood. Just loving the first take every time.
[3:29:05] <@SoFarFetched> Yeah Swery was forced to put combat in the first game,which is why its so easy and simple
[3:29:06] <%weissguard> Quint's infinite pipe works were fun.

[3:51:50] <%miguelrod777> LUL
[3:51:50] <%NopeBadguy> Zach might, York doesn't
[3:51:52] <AnneSQF> cant send a 9 yo home alone when her parents are misssing
[3:51:52] <CappuccinoGuil> @FutaSnek SOCIETY DOESN'T KNOW THAT
[3:51:52] <TheReaperofGrim> That is a good point Pat
[3:51:53] <FleshFriend> Chat is picking fruit off the fucking ground
[3:51:53] <%StaceMcGate> York fucks
[3:51:53] <%BioHunter> york does but not zach
[3:51:53] <+smevvster> Yeah Chat doesn't need to be weird the game's got that covered
[3:51:53] <%MrBorisMakarov> atpRtsd
[3:51:54] <3viltiki> Is York canonically a Ken Doll?
[3:51:54] <%toastybites> Does he not need her guardian's consent????
[3:51:54] <%tigerfang86> York's never seen a sex before
[3:51:54] <+teslaclesdeviant_> york literally leaves this world for ghost pussy
[3:51:54] <KoyaMusa> pat is weird enough, the chat doesn't need to add on more
[3:51:55] <sssoapy> Mamoru patti!
[3:51:55] <KaitlynnHere> @baslerjones no

[3:51:56] <%CaptainPileDriver> YES
[3:51:57] <%Slimshazbot> That wouldn't surrpise me
[3:51:57] <deathsmions1> Zach's the player it's lore
[3:51:57] <Badgerconda_> Stop being weird? STOP BEING WEIRD?! have you SEEN the game you're playing!?
[3:51:57] <%Maids4lyfe> York drank his respect women juice
[3:51:58] <star_feline> York knows what sex is but refuses to believe it in
[3:51:58] <Spiralpower1620> but he has grandchildren
[3:51:59] <DusK_The_Stray> I mean, he can't really just leave her alone.
[3:52:00] <%CaptainPileDriver> ON THE FLOOR
[3:52:00] <+LandOfTheWay> @PatStaresAt zach doesn't know, but york does
[3:52:01] <%TheDewdHole> He's gonna protect her from Deep South incest ghosts
[3:52:01] <Pnutz409> is the Hotel protected somehow?
[3:52:02] <stabbityrabbit> Yes.
[3:52:03] <OldManDeckardCain> he knows what sex is, from a movie LUL
[3:52:03] <%CaptainPileDriver> IN THE BACK
[3:52:04] <CookieCutter007> yes :)
[3:52:04] <%srkAres> @PatStaresAt he knows from the movies
[3:52:04] <%Stonebeard> He's going to make Patti watch all the Arnold S movies
[3:52:04] <+pynkdoe> yep
[3:52:05] <+KoryMccool> YE
[3:52:06] <dukenux> We can't stop getting weird with THIS game
[3:52:07] <PastaL> His idea of sex is heavily influenced by Cat People
[3:52:07] <%alcors_wisdom> you gotta mamuru your daughterfu pat
[3:52:07] <%hzealot> lena know what sex was taught it to her sister
[3:52:07] <%cvp5127> cant leave her with familly
[3:52:07] <%Agami23> he knows what it is, its a plot point to push the story in several movies
[3:52:08] <%UvBenServed> He probably saw sex in a movie once
[3:52:08] <einSynd> I'm sure he's seen it in a few movies
[3:52:08] <SolsticeZro> That's how the FBI works
[3:52:08] <+jimmiepyle> "sir these ghosts are coming out of your penis!"
[3:52:09] <%za7az> DP1 disagrees with you on thst
[3:52:10] <SirDogBear> she gonna love his voodle altair with his power ups CorgiDerp
[3:52:11] <dinnydanny777> YES HE DOES HE ASKED ABOUT PATTI'S MOTHER BEING HOT EARLIER
[3:52:11] <Valdorick> THE HOTEL WILL CLEARLY BE BETTER
[3:52:11] <%Deano8817> york probably thinks pornography is a movie from the 80's
[3:52:11] <+DinnerCalzone> Yes. :)
[3:52:14] <+jiggy_snipe> LUL
[3:52:14] <%CaptainPileDriver> THROW THE CHILD TO THE FLOOR
[3:52:14] <Spiralpower1620> York is a Sexthiest
[3:52:14] <%miguelrod777> cursed insect magic bloodline
[3:52:14] <BaslerJones> DIDN'T YORK WANNA FUCK THE COP IN DP1 ?
[3:52:15] <snowmanse> @Spiralpower1620 That was declared non-canon
[3:52:19] <CappuccinoGuil> @Stonebeard that's too mean NotLikethis
[3:52:19] <Shwepie> Not kidnapping, protective custody.
[3:52:20] <mattdel92> He saw sex in a movie once
[3:52:21] <%StaceMcGate> @PatStaresAt he is not even leaving a note Pat
[3:52:23] <%AncelDeLambert> Put the baby in jail, it'll be fine
[3:52:23] <FutaSnek> F
[3:52:24] <AnneSQF> rip
[3:52:24] <samura1_queen19> Doesn’t he have a granddaughter or somethin
[3:52:25] <dinnydanny777> He literally called two women hot earlier on
[3:52:26] <%hzealot> did we get the moms first name?
[3:52:27] <Spiralpower1620> oh ok
[3:52:27] <DusK_The_Stray> York knows what sex is but it's the most clinical way possible
[3:52:28] <Valdorick> They shot Melvin in the face.
[3:52:30] <+xeros720> rip melvin
[3:52:30] <Ranko2Danko> DONT SAY THAT
[3:52:31] <%za7az> Ever seen Terminator?
[3:52:31] <Blackjack760> super dead
[3:52:32] <deathsmions1> it's cannon Zach fucks and York doesn't
[3:52:33] <the_sprankton> I guess this explains why Patti disappeared in the present. She's probably turning into a tree too.
[3:52:33] <wannabemoogle> oh god Patti's a smart kid she'll figure it all out eventually. Which is super fucked
[3:52:33] <noyman2000> Or cursed probably
[3:52:34] <%CaptainPileDriver> he's just taking a child
[3:52:34] <CappuccinoGuil> I think Melvin is running with the mom
[3:52:34] <%Jack_of_No_Trades> Leave her with the Mirror
[3:52:35] <Pnutz409> noooo Melvin cant beee

[3:52:46] <%alcors_wisdom> to be fair is yorks hotel room any more magic resistent than a police station

[3:53:03] <hoodedlefty> Yoke’s only knowledge of sex is from movies, and I don’t think he see’s porn as cinema
[3:53:04] <Aydarkzero> this town was founded on incest
