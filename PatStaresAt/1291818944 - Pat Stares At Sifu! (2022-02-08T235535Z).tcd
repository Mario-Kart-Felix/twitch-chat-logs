[0:15:11] <%doc_ock_rokc> In middle school the long receiver punched me in the back of my head as hard as he could. He broke his knuckles I was knocked out for 10 seconds mostly due to flying face first into a brick wall... I got more punishment because he was out of football for an entire season
[0:15:12] <Thenuclearwalrus> That Explains a lot

[0:31:59] <+kewlmyc> How the fuck do you find Missingno by accident?
[0:32:02] <SomeStrangeBroad> I just use google
[0:32:05] <TonyBstreaming> It's just wikis now right?
[0:32:07] <%valriot> No i get that, like fuck doing Elden Ring in any way but blind
[0:32:07] <+kewlmyc> It's so specific
[0:32:09] <%Agami23> i like getting the fromsoft strategy guides because they tend to be wrong
[0:32:11] <yourliteraldog> THEY ARE CHEATING AND CHEATING IS GOOD
[0:32:11] <ExpressNode> Is this game good?
[0:32:16] <%nichos7> People trip into all sorts of shit
[0:32:19] <%nichos7> I believe it
[0:32:20] <Ipsenscastle> missingno's easy to find by accident, it's just there
[0:32:22] <Profmcstevie> Finding missingno by accident sounds like bullshit, you have to be so specific
[0:32:24] <HaroldDonchee> AYY DONNY
[0:32:26] <+slidshockingkrow> is that how you say it? "missingno" like "flamingo"? I always said it like "missing no." like two words and the No. was short for number
[0:32:27] <EASrake> What if they hate strategy guides because it is cheating
[0:32:27] <Nordguy> @tonybstreaming let's plays are today's strategy guide tbh
[0:32:28] <Ipsenscastle> the difficult bit is the duplication glitch
[0:32:29] <+johnnychopsocky> I tried to lie to my girlfriend, but somehow she can always SI FU me
[0:32:35] <%Birdigalore> Ron Perlman seems like he'd be so chill with fans
[0:32:47] <%SharkMissile> @PatStaresAt And how Paige will cry just *thinking* about a celebrity.
[0:32:48] <TonyBstreaming> @Nordguy that sounds about right honestly
[0:32:51] <BigFingerRo> he cares not
[0:32:57] <%ChillaxingJay> interesting
[0:32:57] <SomeStrangeBroad> celebs ain't so cool
[0:32:59] <bamberfool> same. unless theyre hot
[0:33:01] <outsidedoubtside> Strategic dissociation
[0:33:03] <%greasypete00> they honestly probably dont care and have had many many cringe interactions
[0:33:05] <Virokwet> anxiety isnt shyness
[0:33:07] <+johnnychopsocky> Ron Perlman seems like the chillest dude
[0:33:14] <%ChrisPlaysThing> Oh man, i'm so fuckin' jazzed tonight. i'm going to max out my performance review again so more $$$$ for me <3
[0:33:15] <SomeStrangeBroad> they just rich assholes who think they are cool
[0:33:15] <auraoftheearth009> Same, George Lucas came into the Starbucks I worked at in San Francisco and I was just all here's your coffee sir
[0:33:23] <TonyBstreaming> I would just say I appreciate their work
[0:33:24] <+FattimusSlime> Ron Perlman had the best Marlon Brando story
[0:33:26] <mak0t0yukii> Oh hey is that angry guy
[0:33:27] <+the_glizzy_wizzy> same dude
[0:33:32] <%rekinom> Ron Perlman reminds me of my grandad
[0:33:36] <@Ranryu692> I just feel awkward meeting someone while already knowing stuff about them lol
[0:33:37] <%ChillaxingJay> yeah for sure
[0:33:47] <%PocketBearIllustrator> so treat them like normal people. gotcha
[0:33:49] <Pookiedaexzile> @FattimusSlime Better than Quincy jones?
[0:33:50] <+ratreborn> just dont shake Ron's hand lol
[0:33:52] <SomeStrangeBroad> I would take a photo with nick cage though
[0:33:56] <%JayCantDo> keanu reeves?

[0:34:53] <+ReallyBigRocks> :)
[0:34:57] <@Ranryu692> so he IS an old man
[0:34:58] <outsidedoubtside> Idris Elba approaches you at a restaurant and tells you you're his favorite twitch streamer, what do you do
[0:35:00] <Blank9> slowbeef's like one of the og LPers
[0:35:03] <+tempestzephyr> that's ancient
[0:35:03] <+johnnychopsocky> Did she have an experience with Tony Hawk or just someone who kinda LOOKS like Tony Hawk?
[0:35:03] <+TheBitingIrish> Tony Hawk is selling the anti-arts NotLikeThis
[0:35:04] <%Brassnarwhal> @thenuclearwalrus to shreds you say?
[0:35:06] <%oda_flobunaga> @HotSauceFiend he invented the LP

[0:36:27] <Toni_Master43> @HotSauceFiend he was the first to record himself playing the game and post it online
[0:36:33] <%chiazam> I’m making my bet Pat hits the 30-40s before the club
[0:36:36] <+mechslayer71> Wonder why that is
[0:36:36] <outsidedoubtside> Was slowbeef one of the OG somethingawful Let's players or was his start in video?

[0:59:34] <HaroldDonchee> @ivanmistwalker God damn I love mad dog so much
[0:59:34] <T_Sasquatch> The game is cool but it definitely has issues with its game design from what ive seen people play its not quite polished

[1:00:24] <+ratreborn> Rogue Lite
[1:00:24] <HaroldDonchee> so it's kinda like a timer?
[1:00:27] <%baka_sugoi> yup
[1:00:29] <%andrewofbob> It's a rogueelite
[1:00:29] <farrellcityking> Damn you DOG EYES!!!!!
[1:00:31] <GeneralHysterics> this a karate rogue lite?
[1:00:31] <%linSP> dont screw yourself game
[1:00:33] <%greasypete00> is this a roguelike?
[1:00:35] <penitentpendant> Pseudo Rogue Lite?
[1:00:38] <+toomuchsnarf> yup
[1:00:39] <GeneralHysterics> aight, aight
[1:00:39] <KosOrSomeSayKosm_> well, restart by level, but yeah, roguelike
[1:00:40] <Bonebagmel> yiep
[1:00:41] <yourliteraldog> Wut
[1:00:43] <%sporeian94> OH MY GOD IT'S GOD HAND HADES
[1:00:43] <%baka_sugoi> Rouge lite
[1:00:43] <T_Sasquatch> yup thats why the game is hard LUL
[1:00:46] <%RealThiele> Revenge-lite
[1:00:47] <mrtanaka111> quite linear
[1:00:50] <+johnnychopsocky> I was totally bumping to the Raids Costs white waiting to ok3ay Sifu
[1:00:50] <mrtanaka111> not roguelike
[1:00:51] <+slidshockingkrow> there's some really neat Ludo-narrative metaphor baked into the mechanics
[1:00:52] <%chiazam> Kinda
[1:00:52] <user_naim> rogue lite lite
[1:00:53] <%AncelDeLambert> this is less roguelike and more Platinum
[1:00:53] <%DianaTheAscian> oh its a rouge lite
[1:00:57] <darkodargon> will this be on pc
[1:00:57] <+ratreborn> u basically wanna do each level without dying if u can lol
[1:01:00] <Reanimator83> Anybody know if the one arm character is a Sofie reference from Kill Bill?
[1:01:01] <NeonBleu> The Sifu of Isaac
[1:01:03] <yourliteraldog> Thats neet
[1:01:04] <+S7ubbs> not roguelike more like metriod
[1:01:06] <%baka_sugoi> Chi Na
[1:01:06] <TonyBstreaming> Age is basically a number of chances. Once you get past 70 you gotta restart the level
[1:01:09] <%IronOhki> For convenience.
[1:01:14] <%andrewofbob> You choose how far back you want to roll back the run
[1:01:16] <HaroldDonchee> what was that game with the robots and they start dying and there's a world timer
[1:01:19] <+johnnychopsocky> Holy crap, my keyboard failed me
[1:01:19] <mrtanaka111> @darkodargon açready on epiuc store
[1:01:23] <%rumtumtugnutz> It's a roguelite, in that if you get past 70 everything resets
[1:01:23] <%AncelDeLambert> yeah, I don't know about labelling this a roguelike
[1:01:27] <%RealThiele> her social credit took a big hit she had to go
[1:01:30] <%vehementvadr> convinglish
[1:01:31] <%oda_flobunaga> @darkodargon Once the epic store exclusive lapses, yes
[1:01:32] <%twistedj3ster> This feels almost like what Deathloop *wanted* to be
[1:01:32] <%baka_sugoi> is there a language setting?
[1:01:37] <mrtanaka111> its just not a roguelike
[1:01:37] <%superc37> wait so does that mean absolver took place in the real world then? weird
[1:01:38] <WG101> the combo dimension
[1:01:39] <%AoiRob> there a movelist?
[1:01:47] <bazz_tv> I read Buttons was comparing this game to god hand on twitter, is that true?
[1:01:50] <wrydiculous> It's in China but I found a wall scrawled in Kanji
[1:01:53] <AvroEltz> pause for movelist
[1:01:54] <+johnnychopsocky> The name of this game is "replay replay replay, practice makes perfect"
[1:01:55] <+mechslayer71> this soundtrack is stellar so far
[1:01:58] <%rumtumtugnutz> No, it's not a roguelike
[1:02:02] <ShadeTheNovice> pause menu has a movelist yeah
[1:02:02] <TonyBstreaming> You start at the age you ended up at the end of the level for the next stage. If you want to go in younger you have to complete the previous level at a younger age
[1:02:10] <pi_in_the_sci> You haven't unlocked the forward+forward yet
[1:02:10] <%chiazam> Make sure to check out your combo list Pat
[1:02:12] <darkodargon> Thank you @oda_flobunaga
[1:02:12] <%KeiganOfAstora> Chane the AI behaviour
[1:02:13] <%baka_sugoi> Stick woolieSPICE
[1:02:14] <%superc37> @bazz_tv it was made by the same peeps as absolver, so probably
[1:02:14] <%andrewofbob> Pat with a bat?
[1:02:15] <mrtanaka111> @wrydiculous ''asian''
[1:02:16] <%Bailey__Gaming> STICK
[1:02:17] <%KeiganOfAstora> Press LEFT on the d-pad
[1:02:18] <zenith0111> ITS SIFU
[1:02:19] <+OverzealousEuthanasiast> now we talking
[1:02:29] <Codofwisdom> This game is probably based off the phrase "You're ten years too early to beat me!"
[1:02:31] <zenith0111> STIIICK
[1:02:35] <+OmegaFatalis> the training hell dimension
[1:02:35] <%baka_sugoi> wooliePOYO wooliePOYO wooliePOYO
[1:02:38] <GeneralHysterics> I'm really interested to see how all this plays out
[1:02:41] <+johnnychopsocky> Yep.  It's a Roguelike where you can piece together your run
[1:02:43] <%linSP> wheres GUN
[1:02:46] <%cooldude69xx> @wrydiculous Japanese people live in china guys
[1:02:48] <Pookiedaexzile> Thers a Combo list
[1:02:55] <Pookiedaexzile> Theres a combo list
[1:02:57] <%Ne1son> Weapons do much damage
[1:02:58] <%valriot> LUL
[1:03:00] <%baka_sugoi> No GUN ONLY KUNG FU
[1:03:02] <triangularblasphemy> Yeah Deathloop was overrated
[1:03:02] <+ReallyBigRocks> it's the skill tree
[1:03:02] <Jontman42> literal skill tree
[1:03:03] <%nichos7> Snrk
[1:03:04] <triangularblasphemy> For me
[1:03:04] <Brunty023> A literal skill tree!
[1:03:04] <TonyBstreaming> THE SKILL TREE IS A REAL TREE
[1:03:06] <mrtanaka111> @johnnychopsocky its really not at all a roguelike, compeltely linear game
[1:03:06] <Nabs96> So do we not like Deathloop now??
[1:03:09] <@PrefectusCorgi> Its a Skill Tree LUL
[1:03:09] <brunoberserk> skill '''''' tree '''''
[1:03:09] <Ape_Law> ITS A LITERAL SKILL TREE
[1:03:12] <%cooldude69xx> @linSP Gun kata would be sick
[1:03:13] <wrydiculous> You can say it's a melting pot of cultures
[1:03:13] <televisedrevolting> The Sweep is good.
[1:03:15] <Saltmeisterr> skill tree real
[1:03:16] <%sporeian94> Game looks great, shane it's on the epic store and I'll have to wait a year to play it
[1:03:16] <TonyBstreaming> BEST GAME
[1:03:16] <%AnthroMetal> time to do combo
[1:03:20] <%valriot> Deathloop fell so flat, Prey Moonfall was fucking awesome though
[1:03:21] <+guithegood87> kick shit is the op thing
[1:03:24] <KaiserMario> Deathloop tossing Pat's salad would be a sight indeed
[1:03:25] <arkv01> will the karate kid make a cameo?
[1:03:26] <%twistedj3ster> it felt so bad to move/aim in
[1:03:26] <%SaiyanShoto> Skill “tree” LUL LUL
[1:03:28] <GeneralHysterics> oh there's so many
[1:03:31] <Nabs96> Deathloop isn't the best Arkane game but it was RAD. Ending was shit tho
[1:03:31] <AvroEltz> yes, because he is better then you
[1:03:32] <%Broand> oh no am lato 4 sifu
[1:03:32] <user_naim> god it IS a skill tree you guys are right
[1:03:33] <%Bread_Assassin> I played like an hour of Deathloop and hit a bug where I was not able to unpause, so I quit.
[1:03:33] <Grave_Titan_D> a skill "tree"
[1:03:43] <%Dementedpenguin> @Nabs96 I mean, this isn't the first time Pat took a knock at Deathloop.
[1:03:43] <%G_Thunders> @nabs96 that story has like 0 payoff but it’s good up until you get near the end
[1:03:45] <%linSP> do you think woolie would like sifu

[1:04:04] <user_naim> you can re-upgrade them to make them permnanent once you have them
[1:04:04] <pi_in_the_sci> It's a hook with armor
[1:04:09] <Pookiedaexzile> How much Jackie Chan Energy will this combat have
[1:04:10] <+wiseaud> Is the brightness up really high or is Pat just that pale lol
[1:04:14] <%twistedj3ster> @Bread_Assassin I hit that this afternoon, they never fixed it I guess

[1:13:08] <%Valdorick> The guided punch
[1:13:11] <%oda_flobunaga> Says a man with paunch lasars

[1:15:58] <%chiazam> Yes and no
[1:16:00] <Aussie_Manny> chairVictory chairVictory chairVictory chairVictory chairVictory
[1:16:01] <zenith0111> ???????
[1:16:01] <sirrice77> @Birdigalore around 70ish
[1:16:03] <+Mooseification> you die at 70
[1:16:03] <%baka_sugoi> GOTTO EM
[1:16:03] <soakedhipster> interesting
[1:16:03] <%KeiganOfAstora> You can go back down?
[1:16:04] <terrible35> you got a life back too
[1:16:04] <Montrarious> 75 is the limit
[1:16:04] <mrtanaka111> 70
[1:16:05] <pi_in_the_sci> 75 is the age cap
[1:16:06] <%Ne1son> Counter reset
[1:16:07] <Kaito_Cam> @Birdigalore if you die over 70 you die forever
[1:16:08] <GreenHerbWhiteSmoke> you killed his reincarnation with that one
[1:16:09] <Thenuclearwalrus> @Birdigalore If you die above 70 you lose
[1:16:10] <mrtanaka111> 70 max age
[1:16:10] <+S7ubbs> 70 is the cap after that if you die you die
[1:16:11] <%rumtumtugnutz> Limit is 70
[1:16:12] <%marvel877> Nice of that guy to stand there for a whole year waiting for you to get back up.
[1:16:16] <T_Sasquatch> @barkon345 no but its as close as we will get to that
[1:16:16] <%chiazam> The limit is 70
[1:16:16] <$KnightAsteran> if you die past 70 it's game over
[1:16:16] <wrydiculous> It gets even more brutal
[1:16:16] <majindusto> HOW OLD WILL YOU GO?
[1:16:18] <thebalticguy1> 70 is dead end limit
[1:16:20] <%sniffy77> i can see there being old man runs, where you die like 80 times and then try to beat the game when you're 100. You get all skills, but one life
[1:16:21] <BigFingerRo> I don't know how to feel about this artstyle
[1:16:22] <GreenHerbWhiteSmoke> boss?
[1:16:23] <%nichos7> You can't go younger, but multiple deaths stack how many years you age
[1:16:24] <%Bread_Assassin> Did killing that guy drop his death counter back to 0?
[1:16:25] <%nichos7> I think
[1:16:27] <%Birdigalore> Ah lame.  Was hoping you could become a 2000 year old myth dragon
[1:16:29] <+lumporr> are you visibly older if you're 70???
[1:16:32] <%linSP> DONT GET OLD
[1:16:33] <pi_in_the_sci> this is the other place you ca level up
[1:16:34] <thebalticguy1> KILLING SPECIAL ENEMIES GIVE YOU LIVES BACK
[1:16:36] <LVL1_Scumbag> Does getting older make you weaker or slower?
[1:16:36] <KaiserMario> @PatStaresAt Remember MK Deception Story mode with Shujinko?
[1:16:37] <%chiazam> That’s not a bummer that’s good
[1:16:38] <GhostlySkunk> Thats cool
[1:16:38] <KosOrSomeSayKosm_> BY certain ages
[1:16:39] <+invader_rin> They lock after certain ages
[1:16:39] <@QueequegTheater> Weapon

[1:16:43] <%superc37> HEHEHE
[1:16:43] <%Valdorick> Also, evil guy, this seems like the worst most shitty path to immortality ever.
[1:16:44] <mrtanaka111> @Birdigalore 2000 years old dragon waifu
[1:16:44] <%sniffy77> wait is that max age?
[1:16:44] <+Mooseification> the years start jumping after a few deaths
[1:16:44] <%terrorengine> mind goblin?
[1:16:44] <%baka_sugoi> csbeastSetIn You must be this old to KILL
[1:16:46] <%the_Punktuation> Get to old and you can no longer get the,
[1:16:47] <majindusto> BLINDED  BY THE LIGHT
[1:16:47] <+TheBitingIrish> BEFORE certain ages
[1:16:48] <Montrarious> you start looking old around 30
[1:16:48] <+The_Death_Owl> oh god here come the goblins
[1:16:48] <zenith0111> AGE TREE
[1:16:49] <Daxalog> max not min
[1:16:49] <%cade_calrayn> can you grow younger in any way?
[1:16:49] <%the_Punktuation> Them*
[1:16:49] <+aWanderingKaivo> you are too old for this skill
[1:16:50] <Kaito_Cam> you can only unlock if you're below a certain age
[1:16:50] <%za7az> @LVL1_Scumbag Stronger, but less health
[1:16:53] <Brunty023> @LVL1_Scumbag It makes you a glass cannon. Stronger, but less health
[1:16:53] <GhostlySkunk> @LVL1_Scumbag Yes, but you get more skills as you die too
[1:16:53] <%KeiganOfAstora> Health is good
[1:16:53] <%rumtumtugnutz> @Bread_Assassin No, aging a year reset his counter to 9
[1:16:54] <Thenuclearwalrus> You can only unlock them before that age
[1:16:55] <%SharkMissile> Life on takedowns is MANDATORY
[1:16:55] <%marvel877> You have to suck that much to unlock that shit?
[1:16:56] <T_Sasquatch> 70 isnt the max age, its if you die AFTER 70. You can be like 78 depending on the math
[1:16:56] <coziestbank> It's MAX Age you can get it
[1:16:56] <yourliteraldog> health sounds useful
[1:16:57] <%rumtumtugnutz> *0
[1:16:57] <%andrewofbob> Also only point in a level to learn skills outside a beatdown
[1:16:58] <GreenHerbWhiteSmoke> mangoHmm so many good choices
[1:16:58] <toulon_somberjade> So if oyu died again you would have been 23
[1:16:59] <+lumporr> @lumporr hell yeah
[1:17:01] <%barkon345> @lvl1_scumbag you become a glass canon
[1:17:02] <Ghufufin> @PatStaresAt its not unlock at a certain ages, its get locked out past a certain age
[1:17:03] <@QueequegTheater> Weapon tho
[1:17:03] <%chiazam> You lose those rewards when you age past them @patstaresat
[1:17:05] <+TheAdMerlin> I think health gain on take downs is the only way to get health back
[1:17:06] <CloniiCory> MY EYES!
[1:17:06] <+MikeTD81> no you have until that age to choose them
[1:17:06] <coziestbank> MAX age
[1:17:07] <%strakillias> Always buff pipe
[1:17:09] <thebalticguy1> AS YOU AGE YOU BECOME MORE GLASS CANNON
[1:17:12] <$Mekhet09> @PatStaresAt it's below a certain age not above.
[1:17:13] <+aWanderingKaivo> @marvel877 its the opposite, you need to be BELOW that age

[1:24:30] <+S7ubbs> Health is blocked at age 40
[1:24:30] <GeneralHysterics> is that the KUNG FU DRUG?
[1:24:30] <+aWanderingKaivo> man they spilled that purple mist all over the floor
[1:24:33] <%IvanMistwalker> guys I REALLY like the Raid
[1:24:33] <%the_Punktuation> Completely optional.
[1:24:36] <+aWanderingKaivo> what a waste
[1:24:37] <+theoldone001> Being old is pretty hype tho.
[1:24:38] <%the_Punktuation> I love this game

[1:24:54] <orangerainbow> there's a true ending where you spear every boss
[1:24:54] <+johnnychopsocky> There is a Gold trophy for beating it at 25
[1:24:56] <OnlyGreatGames> Guys he can read....
[1:24:57] <Aussie_Manny> Surely there's at least an achievement for that.
[1:25:00] <yourliteraldog> SUPER DEAD
[1:25:01] <%justcallmebobplease> I want an uber old one-hit-death version as a shrivelled old master.
[1:25:06] <+vanareus> if you beat it 21+ he dies an alcoholic. wait, does that joke only work in America
[1:25:06] <@QueequegTheater> @PatStaresAt You have to rush them, you can't slowly sneak up on them
[1:25:09] <%baka_sugoi> Probably when you get all the clues?

[1:25:31] <%SharkMissile> @fairore sup
[1:25:34] <+mechslayer71> lots of punchlines in this game, I like it
[1:25:37] <OnlyGreatGames> I like when the enemies stand up and the chair they were sitting on explodes
[1:25:43] <+aWanderingKaivo> that was a clean vault over that table
[1:25:45] <GeneralHysterics> find a ladder and fight like jackie chan
[1:25:51] <+johnnychopsocky> Environmental Mastery is a super quality skill to permanently unlock
[1:25:51] <yourliteraldog> This drug looks like candy
[1:25:59] <Capn_Bilge> i keep hearing Crash Bandicoot crate smashin sounds
[1:26:00] <IzanagiNoOokami> Ah shit he's got the cardboard wrapping tube.
[1:26:00] <+mechslayer71> lots of punchgirls* in this game, I like it
[1:26:05] <mr_saturday93> so is knowing kung Fu a prerequisite for a job in the world of sifu?
[1:26:08] <%YakumoYomi> GIRLBOSS

[1:26:36] <%Bread_Assassin> It looks like the enemies with the aura lower your death counter when you beat them.
[1:26:36] <+johnnychopsocky> THWOK
[1:26:36] <Enishi1027> death by boop
[1:26:37] <wrydiculous> @izanaginoookami hey man, those still hurt, especially the thick ones
[1:26:39] <+theoldone001> Unlocking enviromantal weapon options is a must imho. Kicking shit at enemies really helps
[1:26:40] <@QueequegTheater> rigth in the mouf
[1:26:40] <SomeAsianDood> There's a dedicated GIVE UP button Pog
[1:26:43] <Make_me_mad> Man I love how fast the game cuts to the death screen. Just enough time to yell FUCK
[1:26:44] <GeneralHysterics> HAPPY BIRTHDAY
[1:26:48] <WG101> hapy birthdY

[1:27:04] <user_naim> Don’t give him the stick!
[1:27:07] <Kaito_Cam> You also get locked out of unlockable skills at age ranges as well. the bottom is the young man shit
[1:27:08] <Ell1ot> it sounds like you're hitting him with a cardboard tube
[1:27:09] <OnlyGreatGames> Anyone know if there's a NG+ where you start at 20 with the upgrades?
[1:27:09] <%mield916> that arkham working out for you pat?
[1:27:24] <%sniffy77> what does the skull going down mean?
[1:27:24] <@Moobot> Hey folks, just a reminder! If you have Twitch connected to Discord, you can access the PSA Sub-Discord. Go to your User Settings, go to Connections, and click 'Join' on the PSA server under the Twitch connection.
[1:27:25] <%KeiganOfAstora> You kicked her in the pussy!
[1:27:31] <Madinki> So how many lives do you get?
[1:27:36] <GreenHerbWhiteSmoke> once pat beats the game he should do a Grey Fox run
[1:27:36] <%baka_sugoi> That Bamboo TUNK
[1:27:40] <+theoldone001> I hadn't kept up with this game so I was surprised you could choose your character's gender.
[1:27:42] <%andrewofbob> @sniffy77 The aging on death is reduced
[1:27:46] <%SharkMissile> Nay
[1:27:49] <%HunguyTV> It escalates on death
[1:27:49] <+TheFrancix> 70
[1:27:50] <+ratreborn> the skull going down is how many lives its NOT going to take, so if u keep dying u start losing 2 or more lives per death
[1:27:50] <+S7ubbs> @Madinki depends how many times you die in a row
[1:27:51] <SomeAsianDood> He thinks it's 50 LUL
[1:27:51] <zanzibarian_hamster> That crash bandicoot crate sound effect is really distracting
[1:27:52] <Bonebagmel> murder
[1:27:52] <T_Sasquatch> @sniffy77 reduces the number added to your age everytime you die
[1:27:52] <+johnnychopsocky> oh no it aint
[1:27:53] <OnlyGreatGames> 50 as long as you progress, if you get stuck it's much less
[1:27:54] <@QueequegTheater> There's an achievement for doing that fight is 120 seconds
[1:27:54] <televisedrevolting> @sniffy77 For every chained death, you Age that many years.
[1:27:59] <+Exicuren> @madinki As much age as you can spend
[1:27:59] <GreenHerbWhiteSmoke> you get to live up till 75
[1:28:01] <%sniffy77> oh damn
[1:28:01] <%Broand> It depends on how hard you get your ass kicked
[1:28:02] <T_Sasquatch> 50 OMEGALYL
[1:28:03] <%Ne1son> Not exactly the death counter is cumulative
[1:28:06] <fairore> @theoldone001 you can ?
[1:28:07] <%AncelDeLambert> 50 TOTAL for the whole game. You get like five for the level
[1:28:11] <Make_me_mad> Dying multiple times in a row makes you age more at a time, though. I watched a dude lose 8 years in one death last night.
[1:28:13] <televisedrevolting> JUMP HIM IN DIALOGUE
[1:28:14] <+ratreborn> WHACK EM
[1:28:14] <+mechslayer71> FAT EVIL
[1:28:15] <TheSinner42> he doesnt know LUL
[1:28:16] <Kaito_Cam> @OnlyGreatGames there is no NG+ you have to buy skills enough times to unlock them forever and you can replay levels at the lowest age you reached them at.
[1:28:16] <wrydiculous> "technically" 50
[1:28:20] <+HeroSolaire> I hate that the dodge button is on R2
[1:28:21] <penitentpendant> Jiggle Physics is GO
[1:28:21] <@QueequegTheater> @PatStaresAt RUSH HIM
[1:28:25] <+Xelig> the amount of lives is kinda flexible
[1:28:26] <+johnnychopsocky> It's your death counter.  Dying gets worse exponentially
[1:28:26] <+Agentoracle> It's less than 50.  but more than enough.  you unalive at age 80+
[1:28:28] <MidnightPacif1c> they tryna get the pipe
[1:28:28] <%ShinobiPhoenix> literally fat evil
[1:28:28] <GreenHerbWhiteSmoke> fat evil baldie
[1:28:30] <AvroEltz> It varies on your performance, i was able to get 4 years in 1 death
[1:28:30] <%RealThiele> BOOBA
[1:28:31] <%Valdorick> No Shen Wei motherfucker
[1:28:31] <%IvanMistwalker> ENEMIE TYPES THAT'S RAD
[1:28:33] <penitentpendant> Evil Pat Defeated!
[1:28:33] <%chiazam> If you age past 70, your next death is a Game Over
[1:28:40] <+ratreborn> smooth widdit
[1:28:41] <%SharkMissile> Pat you're doing awesome
[1:28:42] <WG101> that was sick
[1:28:43] <@QueequegTheater> @PatStaresAt If you attack him in dialogue you can skip the whole fight
[1:28:52] <dan_g_v> good jank game?
[1:28:52] <%DianaTheAscian> so when you hit 70 do you just  drop dead or do you need to die 1 more time?
[1:28:54] <%Bluwizard21> @PatStaresAt Advanced enemy will just have a gun
[1:28:55] <+theoldone001> @fairore Yep. It's just cosmetic but I appreciate it as a girl, being an ass kicking grandma is cool.
[1:28:56] <%DovaDude29> bruh, pats fighing wide whale? on god?
[1:28:58] <%chiazam> BITCHES LEAVE
[1:29:05] <%baka_sugoi> Just like water Pat, Be water
[1:29:06] <penitentpendant> Renegade Non-Prompts!
[1:29:17] <+S7ubbs> @QueequegTheater lie
[1:29:26] <%WackyGear> get health
[1:29:27] <Kaito_Cam> @DianaTheAscian you get past 70 and after one more death u die
[1:29:28] <+McSoliace> he's super right
[1:29:30] <@QueequegTheater> @QueequegTheater I literally did it
[1:29:31] <Oleai> I bought this game because I saw girl was an option at the start. Gaming needs more badass grandmas
[1:29:32] <Jrocy247> Chat can't read, you know this
[1:29:34] <%baka_sugoi> BE OLD LUL
[1:29:36] <mr_saturday93> Reeeeeding? what's that?
[1:29:37] <+AnActualHermitCrab> asking people to read is asking too much.
[1:29:38] <wrydiculous> you dont skip the whole fight, but you certainly have one less fat guy to worry about
[1:29:39] <+TheBitingIrish> Max didn't realize the age bit until his second stream
[1:29:42] <+Agentoracle> Flow like internet rapper
[1:29:42] <Madinki> He thinks chat can read Kappa
[1:29:44] <%Broand> That's not your age though, that's your death counter
[1:29:44] <%vehementvadr> well you can't get the 25 one
[1:29:46] <Zahrtreiv> yeah getting the drop on them on subsequent runs really lends you an advantage, noone expects the mid-dialogue brick throw
[1:29:49] <%RealThiele> I was elected to lead, not to read
[1:29:56] <@QueequegTheater> Bold of you to assume we are literate
[1:29:56] <+johnnychopsocky> That spends the XP
[1:29:57] <%chiazam> And then after a certain age you LOSE those bonuses
[1:29:57] <%DovaDude29> how much does age skip foward on death?
[1:30:02] <GeneralHysterics> stick is a good weapon
[1:30:02] <%jackythefrost> @Oleai But how can you be kung fu master without giant beard
[1:30:03] <%za7az> Hell yeah, stick
[1:30:04] <+ratreborn> the weapons are a god send
[1:30:04] <Kaito_Cam> THe lower skills get locked out as you age.
[1:30:06] <%baka_sugoi> STICK MASTER
[1:30:06] <wrydiculous> @zahrtreiv those are the best
[1:30:07] <+smackbear> get ya sticks here
[1:30:08] <@QueequegTheater> @DovaDude29 one per skull
[1:30:10] <%za7az> Pogchamp
[1:30:10] <%SABiscotti> Pat's Biggest Stick Build
[1:30:10] <zenith0111> STICK BUILD
[1:30:12] <+TheBitingIrish> @DovaDude29 The counter next to age
[1:30:13] <SomeAsianDood> @DovaDude29 scales up with deaths per level
[1:30:13] <+S7ubbs> @DovaDude29 depends on how many dies in a row
[1:30:13] <definitelynotjayy> stickfu
[1:30:13] <Thenuclearwalrus> @DovaDude29 amount of your death counter
[1:30:13] <Kaito_Cam> in the skill tree.
[1:30:19] <+rbakervv> @DovaDude29 it goes up by the number of your current death counter
[1:30:20] <twistedhands> all in on sticks? now to go find you a blind kid to teach martial arts to
[1:30:21] <%SABiscotti> PAT STICKS AT
[1:30:22] <T_Sasquatch> @DovaDude29 depends on number of deaths
[1:30:23] <blowfishchunky> how's the game, Pat?
[1:30:23] <OnlyGreatGames> This is like The Witness with Kung Fu instead of puzzles
[1:30:27] <+theoldone001> @Oleai That's why I love Lady Butterfly, grandmas doing sick martial arts and ninja shit is hype.
[1:30:27] <%DovaDude29> aight
[1:30:27] <AngryAsian5> Sticks have been a good weapon for thousands of years, it's a good investment.
[1:30:32] <%sniffy77> who will win? Decades of martial arts training and discipline, or one sticky boi?
[1:30:34] <sirrice77> @DovaDude29 every death adds 1 to skull counter and every death ages by the counter amount
[1:30:37] <+Agentoracle> @dovadude29  depends +1 year per death, cumulative - so die twice it's +2 year, 3 times it's +3 year, etc.
[1:30:38] <Oleai> yeyey
[1:30:44] <%DovaDude29> quessing the start age is around 20 or 21?
[1:30:51] <@QueequegTheater> 20
[1:30:54] <Thenuclearwalrus> 20
[1:30:56] <DXLelouch24> @PatStaresAt that door is endgame shit
[1:30:56] <%oda_flobunaga> How about a John Wick game done in this style but with guns?
[1:30:57] <+ratreborn> 20
[1:31:00] <crazypsico55> Aeriths church?
[1:31:00] <LVL1_Scumbag> Many opium
[1:31:01] <wrydiculous> 20

[1:37:36] <+johnnychopsocky> Replay the level.  Get practice, get young
[1:37:36] <Pookiedaexzile> No you need to practice that was smart

[1:37:49] <+McSoliace> resetting early isnt really worth it

[1:38:00] <%chiazam> YOU REALLLLLY want to permanently unlock abilities
[1:38:02] <huskarl_zap> Just use the summon signs so someone else can finish it for you
[1:38:05] <+Xelig> you did a hell of a lot better than my first run
[1:38:06] <mr_saturday93> so ya can't de age?
[1:38:08] <%chiazam> Otherwise you’re wasting EXP
[1:38:08] <user_naim> I got fucked way harder than that Pat
[1:38:09] <Kaito_Cam> you can no longer unlock some of that young man shit.
[1:38:09] <dan_g_v> hey chat peoples, are we watching the Direct tomorrow?
[1:38:12] <+FanServ> @HeroSolaire but he only spent 8 years, the aging is from the talisman
[1:38:13] <%cooldude69xx> @HeroSolaire John Sifu is magically aging while time goes by normally. It's probably his magic lik ehow the other guy had plants
[1:38:17] <Nabs96> The second mission really annoys me tbh. Those 2 dudes before the boss? Fk em
[1:38:19] <knight_verse> Just use the Boivin family secret technique of "Just Cheat".

[1:38:26] <@QueequegTheater> @QueequegTheater But it's been 8 years waiting for the revenge to start
[1:38:27] <penitentpendant> I like the subtle hint that there's now a coin missing from your tree because you've lost 10 years
[1:38:33] <@QueequegTheater> @Bane_Kaikyo Boss
[1:38:38] <pi_in_the_sci> You don't have 2 focus bars, so you can't use that thing

[1:45:39] <+rbakervv> @patstaresit it goes up eveytime you die
[1:45:40] <+ccwettr123> counter goes up every death
[1:45:40] <stormhawk9891> Don't die
[1:45:41] <+manic_raven> it goes up every time you die
[1:45:41] <%Divryne> To lower counter
[1:45:41] <LordOfThePoultry> dying makes the counter go up
[1:45:42] <%HunguyTV> Counter goes up on death and lowers by one when killing special enemies
[1:45:42] <%andrewofbob> Counter goes down when defeating a tough enemy
[1:45:43] <akitanito> counter goes up if you die
[1:45:45] <CaptainBright> It's not meant to be cashed out
[1:45:45] <%baka_sugoi> the aura ppl
[1:45:45] <joodatious> just get more damage
[1:45:46] <Make_me_mad> The counter goes up on consecutive deaths, and goes down when you kill a midboss.
[1:45:46] <+misdirectedwoo> beating tough enemys lowers
[1:45:46] <%kyh9> Any deaths make the counter go up
[1:45:47] <%Eaglestrike117> Mini bosses/Stronger Enemies
[1:45:47] <joodatious> fuck health
[1:45:48] <+guithegood87> and some stronger regulars
[1:45:49] <%oda_flobunaga> gitting gud
[1:45:50] <SomeAsianDood> Minibosses and yellow heat auras
[1:45:50] <Vakojin> Some ennemies drop the count, every death ups it by one.
[1:45:50] <+FanServ> dying -> higher, minibosses -> lower
[1:45:52] <+tomdwarf> Dying increases the age counter by 1. Defeating minibosses/special enemies will reduce it by 1.
[1:45:52] <%the_Punktuation> BEAT THEM, NUMBER GO DOWN
[1:45:52] <+Deasmeister> Goes up each time you die
[1:45:52] <AngryAsian5> Gotta kill the specials to make counter go down
[1:45:55] <%aishman> Counter goes up every time you die. it only goes down against mini bosses ONLY
[1:45:55] <+ALazo> ? Counter goes up if you die. Elite enemies make it go down
[1:45:55] <Kaito_Cam> if you beat the enemies with the aura it go down
[1:45:55] <FinnLastHuman> "Encounters"
[1:45:56] <Pookiedaexzile> Also the give up button is a thing
[1:45:57] <fistynopunches> how goes kung fu orb
[1:45:58] <%IvanMistwalker> health Pat
[1:46:01] <mr_saturday93> I've just look it up you cannot reset your age
[1:46:02] <%aishman> And you keep the counter level to level
[1:46:04] <%the_Punktuation> Yes, that cares over missions.
[1:46:04] <user_naim> Death makes it go up and cashes in
[1:46:06] <%cha0tic_klutch> Counter goes up one every time you die, you age whatever that number is, you subtract one every time you kill him any boss
[1:46:08] <crazypsico55> You dont cash them in, you just age slower with less death counter
[1:46:08] <%JonathLP> You don't "cash it out" until you complete a level
[1:46:09] <%Ne1son> What do you actually want to know
[1:46:10] <+MikeTD81> and 1st stage of bosses
[1:46:10] <jack_dt2> hi
[1:46:11] <%nichos7> You just what?
[1:46:11] <+guithegood87> some strong regulars cut down the age multiplier
[1:46:12] <%linSP> dying seems like a bad idea
[1:46:12] <%the_Punktuation> You NEED perfection.
[1:46:12] <Thecandyman36> @patstaresat it doesn't cash out it just goes up or down
[1:46:12] <%kyh9> You just killed two mini-bosses, that reduced the 'death' counter by 2
[1:46:13] <robert_orri> when you die you add one to the counter and then that number adds to your age, defeating special enemies lowers the counter @PatStaresAt
[1:46:13] <+seaearthandsky> getting your ass beat versus doing well I think
[1:46:14] <%sniffy77> i think that's the point
[1:46:14] <+FadingEmber> that explaination seemed correct
[1:46:15] <Pookiedaexzile> Use your word Pat
[1:46:15] <%andrewofbob> You killed a glowy guy and the platform-boots girl
[1:46:15] <%cha0tic_klutch> a mini boss**
[1:46:16] <LVL1_Scumbag> We all gotta die sometime
[1:46:19] <%kyh9> ALL deaths make the counter go up
[1:46:19] <%the_Punktuation> That is the Game Loop.
[1:46:22] <OnlyGreatGames> What is confusing about this? It went down by 1 for magic man, then 1 for girl just now
[1:46:22] <%JonathLP> If you die at 8, it stays at 8 or goes to 9
[1:46:22] <arikk42> Death = Counter Up
[1:46:23] <+laserchainsaws> Counter always goes up on death by one you age up depending on how big the death counter is
[1:46:27] <person181> aren't we all pat, aren't we all
[1:46:31] <%Hamborgini> "I'm going to die pretty soon" - Me, every time I wake up in the morning
[1:46:32] <+gruff_gridof> dolphinPls dolphinPls dolphinPls dolphinPls dolphinPls
[1:46:34] <odnucaf3> is this a Rouge Like?
[1:46:35] <arikk42> Mini Boss Defeat = Counter Down
[1:46:36] <mr_saturday93> if he hits a game over does he start over from the beginning?
[1:46:36] <Aussie_Manny> Maybe.
[1:46:37] <%AyotoCorp> @PatStaresAt Btw right in the d-pad is a taunt for extra DMC score building
[1:46:38] <+johnnychopsocky> die, counter go up.  die again, counter go up again and you die harder.  beat strong guy, die less hard next time
[1:46:40] <+Xelig> every time you die, the counter goes up and tallies up your age that amount, some enemies defeated will lower the counter, making your next death less impactful to making you reach max age
[1:46:42] <%aishman> @patstaresat Just FYI the counter doesn't reset between levels.
[1:46:48] <Madinki> So now if you die again you'll be Woole's age.
[1:46:48] <+aWanderingKaivo> says square
[1:46:56] <%nichos7> Every death makes your counter go up by 1, then you age a number of years equal to your counter
[1:47:00] <Nabs96> If anyone's gone past the 2nd level here, how would you rate the others in comparison? I've done half of the third level and I feel it's much easier than the Club
[1:47:07] <T_Sasquatch> greys at 34 is rough
[1:47:08] <%HunguyTV> back forward square is a good push move
[1:47:10] <%RealThiele> not a fan of the flashbang menu
[1:47:13] <+johnnychopsocky> light light heavy does a push
[1:47:19] <wrydiculous> also you can reset the counter to 0 at dragon statues
[1:47:26] <WG101> OW
[1:47:29] <akitanito> you broke her back
[1:47:40] <+AnActualHermitCrab> What doesn't he hate?
[1:47:52] <CloniiCory> @T_Sasquatch I'm getting them at 25. Stress is misery.
[1:47:53] <%Deadpal> Garak.
[1:47:53] <%Axellogic> Eli? Hate?
[1:47:55] <%gimmiedagorbage> up+down+square is big push
[1:47:57] <CaptainBright> this is an FGC/reflex game
[1:47:58] <OnlyGreatGames> Can't wait for the polygon article about how unneccessarily violent this game is
[1:47:58] <T_Sasquatch> @AnActualHermitCrab anthro females
[1:47:59] <SomeAsianDood> They sure do
[1:48:00] <Daxalog> Eli would probably end up floating in the higher ages..where something... yknow..
[1:48:00] <robert_orri> they do
[1:48:01] <triangularblasphemy> you get stronger
[1:48:01] <%Deadpal> He doesn't hate Garak.
[1:48:05] <%Bluwizard21> probably
[1:48:06] <Madinki> Eli hates every game he plays.
[1:48:06] <triangularblasphemy> it literally raises your damage
[1:48:07] <pi_in_the_sci> They speed up
[1:48:08] <Kaito_Cam> They do
[1:48:08] <Nabs96> Customisable difficulty would be great for this game. I'd definitely adjust the disparity between our damage and enemy damage.
[1:48:10] <%AyotoCorp> Animations change a little, the taunt definitely changes as you age up
[1:48:12] <+AnActualHermitCrab> @T_Sasquatch lmao true
[1:48:14] <jbrachob> you also get stronger
[1:48:20] <+johnnychopsocky> booo took the slow way up
[1:48:22] <GreenHerbWhiteSmoke> PUNCH LASERS
[1:48:26] <+tomdwarf> You deal more damage the older you get
[1:48:26] <Animal_Farm4> You got vicious in your old age
[1:48:28] <%amaranthos> amaranthos subscribed at Tier 1. They've subscribed for 7 months! I made a joke a while ago about EA Bethesda Apple competing against Activision Blizzard Microsoft, but I forgot that Microsoft already owns Bethesda
[1:48:30] <coziestbank> right on d pad to taunt, changes with age
[1:48:30] <Kaito_Cam> They are
[1:48:30] <Emperor_Z> If you die of old age, is there a way to continue other than just reloading a save and doing better?
[1:48:31] <%RetroCop87> Eli would hate how much this game informs him how much he sucks at the game
[1:48:32] <+ALazo> the beard makes them meaner
[1:48:35] <odnucaf3> This is not GodHand :c
[1:48:39] <austonishing1> damn he did not have to do her like that lmaooo slammed her into the wall
[1:48:41] <Ell1ot> do animations get grumpy with age?
[1:48:45] <genmypoweralready> They change a tiny bit and you gain more damage as you get older, but you're also a frail old fuck
[1:48:49] <Vakojin> Don't know if it's multiplier or age.
[1:48:50] <+laserchainsaws> As you get older your health decreases but your strength increases @patstaresat
[1:48:51] <GreenHerbWhiteSmoke> do some blood arts pat
[1:48:58] <akitanito> oh no you old

[2:00:36] <Jrocy247> Pat's trying to master Drunk Fist and is failing horribly
[2:00:38] <Profmcstevie> Perfect battle to avoid the liver spots
[2:00:41] <%chiazam> Laser Piss!!!

[2:03:02] <Profmcstevie> Many people are playing it
[2:03:03] <%cade_calrayn> i've seen a lot of people saying they're playing it on Twitter
[2:03:04] <%shurtal> Max was quoted as saying "this is a game that makes you want to play it perfectly"
[2:03:04] <%rumtumtugnutz> Lost Ark is out today for founders
[2:03:06] <TrashMammalVEVO> Nice 400lb squat bro,she just let me hit it cuz i'm goofy
[2:03:07] <+theoldone001> Founders play early right? I'm playing right now
[2:03:08] <%Bread_Assassin> I see people streaming it NOW,
[2:03:09] <Thenuclearwalrus> You can buy early access
[2:03:11] <Sunstalker> Founders pack buyers get early acces, Pat
[2:03:12] <Jack_Nightshadow> Lost Ark comes out officially 3 days from now.
[2:03:15] <+seaearthandsky> early access today full release friday
[2:03:15] <GeneralHysterics> isn't lost ark flashy but trashy? Game didn't feel good when I tried it out
[2:03:18] <%rumtumtugnutz> And it's out on Friday for Plesbians
[2:03:19] <%JoshManVGH> Guess early access landed. Someone in my FC is trying to play
[2:03:23] <%king_wragles> Is there no way to heal in this?
[2:03:28] <%JonathLP> @PatStaresAt Regular comes out Friday
[2:03:34] <GhostlySkunk> Asmongold stole all the viewers today lmao
[2:03:36] <+Kavtech> @GeneralHysterics It's pretty alright.
[2:03:36] <+Buttlo> I have no idea if there are still issues but it was rough to download for most people.
[2:03:37] <+johnnychopsocky> Heal by doing takedowns
[2:03:37] <GhostlySkunk> 200k+
[2:03:37] <$velgaduere> @king_wragles you heal with every kill
[2:03:42] <Pookiedaexzile> @king_wragles Killing
[2:03:46] <DXLelouch24> @PatStaresAt apparently Lost Arks pretty good and the director even made a trailer and gives a shit about what he created, you should stream it
[2:03:55] <%Birdigalore> Shit's unlocked
[2:04:02] <zerointelligence000> gameplay :O
[2:04:05] <+aWanderingKaivo> lost ark is a diablo right
[2:04:05] <%shurtal> shortcut porn
[2:04:05] <TheQuadrupleS> Is it any founders pack chat?
[2:04:09] <+johnnychopsocky> You picked up the key last run.  Shortcuts!
[2:04:11] <Aussie_Manny> This game continues to expand.
[2:04:13] <%JoshManVGH> People saying Friendship with PoE is over, now Lost Ark new best friend.
[2:04:14] <GhostlySkunk> @Buttlo Yeah that pissed me off. was an extra hour wait for steam to get their shit together.
[2:04:19] <user_naim> hell yes
[2:04:22] <+Kavtech> This path sucks because you only get two permanent upgrades instead of three.
[2:04:22] <%Bread_Assassin> So what on the schedule is getting the boot?
[2:04:23] <+theoldone001> I don't know what class to play, always default to mage.
[2:04:24] <%thebeargoesHONK> i'd rather watch more path of exile
[2:04:25] <%AncelDeLambert> "I don't think about you at all"
[2:04:32] <%RealThiele> PoE is a mess these days tbh
[2:04:35] <%JoshManVGH> But it's not on console so it's PoE for me!
[2:04:42] <DXLelouch24> Lost Ark is massive tho at 70 GB without KR voice pack
[2:04:50] <Ape_Law> the lost arc logo is a uterus
[2:04:51] <%Valdorick> Default to mage, or the Tankest, biggest, beefest fucker you can.
[2:04:54] <%Puhff> i hear lost ark is borked already, which makes sense since it's Aamazon
[2:04:56] <+yoshkosh20> whenever they tell me to put my wep down, I throw it at them.
[2:04:57] <%AncelDeLambert> @DXLelouch24 oh fuck that
[2:05:10] <GhostlySkunk> @DXLelouch24 ???? 70 gigs for me and it gives me option for korean voice acting.
[2:05:16] <GeneralHysterics> @RealThiele poe is better than it's ever been, warts and all
[2:05:18] <+johnnychopsocky> Yeeting the weapon is a good tactic when other weapons are around
[2:05:19] <wrydiculous> i'd stick to stick upgrade
[2:05:28] <%jaco_checkbox> that guy sounded like milhouse
[2:05:29] <+S7ubbs> the health gain is a must
[2:05:38] <+TaifuDragon> gotta learn those directional dodges it makes it so much easier
[2:05:43] <GhostlySkunk> Early game kind of sucks. Not enough mobs and everything dies too easily. However dungeons and bosses show the promise it has at later levels!
[2:05:54] <Shockmaster182> psaDogchamp
[2:06:01] <%superc37> YO THAT AS COOL
[2:06:03] <+yoshkosh20> you should unlock enviormental mastery early. that shit is super useful.
[2:06:07] <+Kavtech> @S7ubbs Is it really that good? You still get good health regen even without any upgrades.
[2:06:14] <%RealThiele> time to farm grunts for abilities roguelike style
[2:06:15] <%Valdorick> Too bad you just inhaled the super cocaine, and will now start rapidly aging as you die every second.
[2:06:19] <+johnnychopsocky> use those Jackie Chan tactics.  Roll, dodge, throw objects
[2:06:22] <+S7ubbs> @S7ubbs it helps a lot in later levels
[2:06:27] <davidwave4_> This game looks like it's more fun to watch than to play
[2:06:31] <GhostlySkunk> OOOF
[2:06:33] <GhostlySkunk> reset
[2:06:33] <%twistedj3ster> Your age is reversing, you're basically thirty, amazingly sturdy
[2:06:41] <+aWanderingKaivo> little bit but two more upgrades to it too
[2:06:44] <%DianaTheAscian> oh no I'm 21
[2:06:45] <zerointelligence000> you can drink now
[2:06:46] <Kaito_Cam> donkey punched
[2:06:53] <+theoldone001> Idk, might be a Punch Girl in Lost Ark. Gunner seems fun too.
[2:06:56] <%SaiyanShoto> Happy birthday!!
[2:06:59] <+johnnychopsocky> It feels great to play.  Getting into the flow feels so good
[2:07:02] <GhostlySkunk> It's having the opposite effect on pat! Everytime his character dies, he himself gets a year younger!
[2:07:02] <%gimmiedagorbage> embarrassing
[2:07:07] <GeneralHysterics> that was real cool
[2:07:12] <davidwave4_> Speedruns of this game are going to be wild
[2:07:20] <+johnnychopsocky> YEP
[2:07:21] <user_naim> nice moves
[2:07:24] <+Photonicfab> first game in a while that FEELS like hong kong fung fu movie
[2:07:31] <%baka_sugoi> BOK
[2:07:34] <%Valdorick> Look at that corpse pile
[2:07:35] <+johnnychopsocky> Enemies can hit enemies, and it's great!
[2:07:36] <%baka_sugoi> BONK
[2:07:40] <%Valdorick> amazing.
[2:07:47] <%SneakTheBeak> psaGiefstare
[2:07:49] <%twistedj3ster> ewww he's so gross

[2:08:09] <+johnnychopsocky> IT'S THE BIG DOG!
[2:08:16] <Shockmaster182> psaDogchamp
[2:08:17] <%IvanMistwalker> fat child
[2:08:17] <user_naim> are his burgers clean?
[2:08:20] <zerointelligence000> I hope this combat becomes the new system for a new Sleeping Dogs game if that ever happens
[2:08:27] <GhostlySkunk> People who are deathly allergic?
[2:08:27] <%HotSauceFiend> Pat thats a silly question
[2:08:27] <%AncelDeLambert> well, dog smelly
[2:08:31] <%gimmiedagorbage> Gief lick
[2:08:32] <arkv01> I love catdog but allergies :(
[2:08:32] <luciluxlu0> allergies
[2:08:33] <%TigerCatGo> He is just a large MASS <3
[2:08:35] <odnucaf3> Dont die of Ligma.
[2:08:38] <penitentpendant> Allergies or bad first experience, usually
[2:08:39] <%JoshManVGH> Monster? or allergic I guess
[2:08:39] <+McSoliace> there evil
[2:08:40] <TheQuadrupleS> They are dead inside
[2:08:40] <mr_saturday93> animal haters and PETA
[2:08:44] <Ghufufin> typically its ppl that have been seriously harmed by dog or cat or allergies
[2:08:46] <%AncelDeLambert> and I don't mean fart smelly, I mean I pet the dog and my hand smells like dog and I do not like
[2:08:48] <%SharkMissile> DOG SMELL AND BIG
[2:08:51] <%SaiyanShoto> I know people who are deathly allergic and they still love cats and dogs
[2:08:55] <RaimeTT> People are heartless
[2:08:58] <ToneBacas> he's gonna do it himself
[2:08:58] <akitanito> throw everything gief!
[2:09:01] <%AncelDeLambert> get your own toy, smelly pig, we love you
[2:09:08] <%RealThiele> Germophobes
[2:09:09] <%cade_calrayn> uh-oh, he's gone behind the couch cushions, we've entered the next stage of Gief Chaos
[2:09:11] <%AncelDeLambert> throw the couch behind the couch, gief!
[2:09:17] <%VentWilsn> can u customize ur character?
[2:09:18] <%WackyGear> yes
[2:09:19] <%YakumoYomi> psaGiefstare
[2:09:20] <%FaultyJawa> FaultyJawa subscribed with Prime. They've subscribed for 6 months! 
[2:09:21] <%IvanMistwalker> you can spare the bosses if you damadge them enough.
[2:09:23] <zerointelligence000> he's looking at it with such yearning lmao
[2:09:24] <+johnnychopsocky> Of course Gief is throwing!  He's a grappler!
[2:09:31] <%chiazam> @patstaresat Personally I think this shortcut sucks because you only get two statues instead of three
[2:09:51] <%marvel877> was AFK for a while, how old is Pat now?
[2:10:02] <%YakumoYomi> Is this route "safer"?
[2:10:07] <GhostlySkunk> @marvel877 He dieded lol
[2:10:08] <%Brassnarwhal> 21
[2:10:09] <+johnnychopsocky> Died already, going again
[2:10:15] <user_naim> @marvel877 he died, and now is 21
[2:10:15] <%HotSauceFiend> Time to kill this inncocent flower seller
[2:10:16] <+S7ubbs> @YakumoYomi safer and faster
[2:10:21] <Pookiedaexzile> Mad Dog has entered the Battle once again
[2:10:22] <%chiazam> @yakumoyomi Less fights
[2:10:28] <odnucaf3> Fuck, so this is a RougeLike :C
[2:10:28] <Kaito_Cam> The 2nd phase of the fight has weapons scattered around the area
[2:10:32] <+johnnychopsocky> Sway to Play!
[2:10:37] <wrydiculous> ye bob and weave!
[2:10:38] <%aishman> @patstaresat Funny enough the club's shortcut still lets you hit all three shrines. It's the only one too.
[2:10:44] <jbrachob> because of the drugs
[2:10:44] <penitentpendant> I mean, he's a drug dealers, so that makes sense
[2:10:49] <Aussie_Manny> En garde. I'll let you try my Ho-Bo style. markel6Fighton
[2:10:59] <%cooldude69xx> @HotSauceFiend In John Sifu's defense. this guy killed him first
[2:11:17] <holyxgrale> The leaping bush kick, his magnum opus
[2:11:23] <DancesWitBalrog> the hobo style hates lows
[2:11:31] <%Brassnarwhal> but with the age checkpoint on zone transition the shorter safer path becomes better in the grand scheme rather than being better for the individual run
[2:11:45] <Kaito_Cam> There are weapons scattered around the area
[2:11:45] <%HunguyTV> Ive wanted an indoor cat for over 15 years but i cant because i'm slightly allergic. So even if I'm fine hanging out with one for a little bit, I cant have one at home full time psaGib
[2:11:49] <Frostofthecwsw> I just got my first permanent unlock. this game is hard as balls >.<
[2:11:56] <%CourageTheCat> holy shit its samurai jack
[2:11:57] <+aWanderingKaivo> nice hp gain from that phase takedown
[2:12:01] <GhostlySkunk> RUN
[2:12:03] <GreenHerbWhiteSmoke> ZAMN PAT HE KICKING YOUR SH1
[2:12:05] <odnucaf3> Weed ninja.

[2:12:06] <Charronia> Best jungler, even creates his own jungle
[2:12:07] <+aWanderingKaivo> gone by the time I typed that though
[2:12:08] <GreenHerbWhiteSmoke> SHI1 IN
[2:12:10] <Ape_Law> pat just bring a gun

[2:12:19] <%HotSauceFiend> THE AGEING AS BEGUN
[2:12:21] <%nichos7> Got
[2:12:28] <GreenHerbWhiteSmoke> Pat hasnt unlocked gun yet
[2:12:33] <holyxgrale> hit him harder chudGigachad
[2:12:34] <%HotSauceFiend> the oldening.... no the quickening
[2:12:37] <+TaifuDragon> good shit sloclap NOW GIVE ME ABSOLVER 2
[2:12:40] <%Brassnarwhal> this is the second aging
[2:12:44] <akitanito> losing the skill until you perma-unlock seems frustrating
[2:12:45] <Kaito_Cam> there are bamboo weapons around the arena
[2:12:57] <%SaiyanShoto> Twist his dick!
[2:13:02] <penitentpendant> Perfect counter?
[2:13:02] <+aWanderingKaivo> you did it the first time this run
[2:13:03] <GreenHerbWhiteSmoke> KOREAN BACKDASH NORMIE GOD
[2:13:03] <%Ne1son> Parry you fool
[2:13:05] <Jrocy247> Just literally walk away from it
[2:13:08] <wrydiculous> weave low, thats a high
[2:13:08] <%HunguyTV> You can R2 backwards if you delay it
[2:13:09] <+johnnychopsocky> Sway left or right
[2:13:10] <%radda343> he bork
[2:13:10] <%SaiyanShoto> I just dodge back
[2:13:12] <holyxgrale> I like how the music stops when he jumps into the bamboo
[2:13:14] <%JoshManVGH> is there a backstep?
[2:13:18] <+johnnychopsocky> and time it out

[2:13:44] <+ccwettr123> Red is parryable, it just MASSIVELY hurts your posture
[2:13:44] <Mattais88> maybe with a weapon?
[2:13:48] <OBS_VinnieK> I think you are supposed to act like Samoa Joe and just walk away
[2:13:50] <%mield916> dodge twice real quick
[2:13:53] <%Ne1son> Parry it anyway
[2:13:55] <%chiazam> You can parry it but it’s not worth it to try
[2:13:59] <%cha0tic_klutch> For that attack it requires a very late dodge to the left or right
[2:14:09] <user_naim> a late sway will work
[2:14:14] <%chiazam> Sway Left Right UP DOWN
[2:14:15] <%SaiyanShoto> I just press R2 and back up LUL
[2:14:28] <wrydiculous> it is possible to parry, but the window is strict af

[2:15:24] <GhostlySkunk> Good luck

[2:15:27] <%JoshManVGH> That seems like a club age
[2:15:28] <penitentpendant> @shry7 He was 12 when they killed his father. So he starts the game at 20. A shame they didn't account for the extra time.
[2:15:29] <Kaito_Cam> Oh welp

[2:30:47] <zerointelligence000> so is the aging random or exponential?
[2:30:57] <%SaiyanShoto> Sure
[2:30:59] <%Valdorick> Remember how 65 year old Pat 1 combo'd that fat man before?

[2:32:30] <+JustToWatch> It sounded more like Reaper then Reefer
[2:32:31] <%Agami23> paige smokes a cigar only when she wears a white shirt, suspenders, and is holding a tommy gun
[2:32:32] <%JoshManVGH> Are skulls reduced by beating any opponent?

[2:35:17] <+MaskedMuscle> ded
[2:35:23] <%AncelDeLambert> this is the game's subtle way of telling you to do something else with your life once you hit 40, stop playin the vidya
[2:35:25] <+ScrelzNYC> farm the xp first then statue
[2:35:25] <@Ranryu692> is that guy a Hokage?

[2:35:48] <OtakuSnake1> I think it's more that your kung fu is more refined
[2:35:48] <%RetroCop87> did that guy just go ultra instinct?
[2:35:49] <%the_Punktuation> by not attacking them..
[2:35:49] <%HunguyTV> You can skip if you dont engage
[2:35:50] <%Valdorick> Your 90 year old teacher? They're not allowed their 1, because they'd Bloody Mess the child.

[2:36:10] <Aussie_Manny> If you can skip them, Pat doesn't wanna anyway.
[2:36:12] <+MaskedMuscle> How many times do we have to teach you this lesson,old man?
[2:36:13] <Sunstalker> Pat's favourite thing is old people beating up kids though so he doesn't have an incentive to stay young. D:
[2:36:14] <chrishansen69_> its what makes them stronger
[2:36:15] <zanzibarian_hamster> Why?
[2:36:16] <+laserchainsaws> He could’ve skipped if he didn’t attack them

[2:48:39] <joodatious> THEY SHOULD

[2:51:33] <%VentWilsn> why does Rise of the Triad star bootleg Black Widow? @PatStaresAt
[2:51:34] <+MaskedMuscle> The real kung fu magic was the friends we made along the way.
[2:51:35] <%Arancet> hired fancy goon?
[2:51:39] <arkv01> amazon workers required to sprot mandatory mohawks
[2:51:40] <%JoshManVGH> Damn it! I gotta go find a PS1!
[2:51:42] <%aishman> @patstaresat It's random who the hidden bad ass is
[2:51:53] <blowfishchunky> did you play the bloodborne ps1 demake?
[2:51:55] <luciluxlu0> I thought the fancy goon was always the last guy alive?
[2:51:58] <T_Sasquatch> The glowing enemies spawn based on if you're doing takedowns alot
[2:52:01] <%G_Thunders> If people stopped giving attention and clicks to clickbait bullshit they’d stop writing bullshit articles
[2:52:06] <%king_wragles> OH, so the badass is RNG based

[2:52:52] <%Djinnazz> still is
[2:52:52] <cnry_m> That is my bad Pat, sorry
[2:52:53] <chrishansen69_> G_Thunders, nice! Im a stupid person give me an example I wont be stopped by!
[2:52:54] <+Mrbaconator> no
[2:52:54] <%NoHoldsBarredProductions> Pat's right. I am very stupid and I will not be stopped.
[2:52:54] <%fatsausagedoggo> I saw a lot of stupid people in Ottawa
[2:52:55] <blowfishchunky> isn't that twitch now?

[2:53:05] <Aydarkzero> but what if though
[2:53:05] <T_Sasquatch> Trend ? It still exists LUL
[2:53:06] <%JonathLP> Why did it stop?
[2:53:09] <mr_saturday93> early YT? oh yeah!
[2:53:11] <HotMafia81> Why are you saying this like it doesn't happen anymore?
[2:53:12] <akitanito> when will you do it
[2:53:15] <Reldritch> no but the Ego though. Id goes BRRRRRRR
[2:53:16] <huskarl_zap> lol no

[2:53:17] <%RealThiele> booba sure y not
[2:53:19] <blowfishchunky> they all went to pornhub, yea
[2:53:21] <person181> why not just go somewhere else to see big boobs
[2:53:23] <theanora1> the whole point of being stupid is never learning
[2:53:23] <wrydiculous> The dick dicktates the mind
[2:53:24] <holyxgrale> When people would put in a split frame for the thumbnail to pick it up
[2:53:24] <Madinki> BUT IF THE BOOBS ARE REAL THIS TIME?!
[2:53:26] <+BigBruthaThunda> you miss 100% of the boobs you don't click on
[2:53:27] <Pookiedaexzile> Advertising at its best
[2:53:28] <%Valdorick> Pat's got the orb on FULL DISPLAY
[2:53:28] <%baka_sugoi> psaOrb
[2:53:30] <%cvp5127> pat is a boob
[2:53:31] <Seth_Tek> that one watch mojo one with sonja from mortal kombat on it.
[2:53:32] <%chiazam> This is WHY WE HAVE PORN
[2:53:33] <+AmanisHouseOfNonsense> But Pat, this fucking Euro Jank article assured me that the Metal Gear movie is totally still happening! Kappa
[2:53:33] <%DianaTheAscian> Pat is a thumbnail confirmed
[2:53:33] <+ReallyBigRocks> which is stupid because it's trivial to find actual big booba on the internet
[2:53:34] <%SaiyanShoto> Pat has a nice set of jugs
[2:53:36] <blowfishchunky> they all signed theeir contracts
[2:53:36] <%marvel877> Pat, your Youtube thumbnails is just a picture of you showing off the orb.
[2:53:38] <%Bane_Kaikyo> T I D D Y
[2:53:39] <+OverzealousEuthanasiast> we as a species are truly fucked
[2:53:44] <%king_wragles> Hey listen, what if that Tetris compilation had a girl with giant knockers and I DIDN'T watch it? I'd feel pretty foolish that's for sure!
[2:53:46] <T_Sasquatch> Man the fortnite strip challenge shit on youtube was disgusting
[2:53:47] <%Bluwizard21> he got dat orb
[2:53:49] <akitanito> what have I done, I'm sorry
[2:53:50] <%marvel877> SHOW PEPPERONI
[2:53:50] <%shurtal> this guy is the drug maker, so it makes since he likes the  highs
[2:53:50] <blowfishchunky> yea, we are
[2:53:53] <%cade_calrayn> so that's why you have Paige on your thumbnails? (i kid)
[2:54:02] <+mrredwednesday> punch da booby
[2:54:03] <Sunstalker> TBF as much as clickbait doesn't work on me, I can vividly remember being a stupid kid expecting to see Xena's boobs the *next time for sure* every time they did a bathing scene LuL
[2:54:08] <TrashMammalVEVO> Are the people looking for boobs on youtube to lazy to switch tabs to pornhub?
[2:54:09] <%cade_calrayn> (no really I kid)
[2:54:11] <%cooldude69xx> I'm still waiting for the guy who brought up Sifu's "cultural issues" to explain what he meant
[2:54:15] <+Samurai_Sphinx> would you say Sifu is approachable for someone who doesn't play too many fighting games?
[2:54:20] <blowfishchunky> and some idiot like Mr beast is gonna "save" us
[2:54:24] <akitanito> PERFECT
[2:54:24] <Kaito_Cam> man that grunt he makes sounds really fucking dumb the nyeaahhhh one.
[2:54:36] <%chiazam> YEA
[2:54:38] <joodatious> @Samurai_Sphinx yes because its not a fighting game
[2:54:45] <%SharkMissile> Pat you're a machine
[2:54:56] <akitanito> just block that machete
[2:54:57] <+transporterthesequel> Isn't that just Mad Dog?
[2:54:58] <blowfishchunky> that's cool
[2:54:58] <Kaito_Cam> There are more bamboo weapons scattered around the arena in the 2nd phase
[2:54:59] <T_Sasquatch> @trashmammalvevo sometimes the search for not easily available porn is the desire (*** addict)
[2:55:01] <%Valdorick> @TrashMammalVEVO No no, its because there's no challenge to it, or something.
[2:55:02] <blowfishchunky> fluid
[2:55:05] <%JonathLP> @PatStaresAt Have you read anything on Lost Ark yet? Do you know what class you'll be playing? Also, you are fucking this boss up.
[2:55:13] <Pookiedaexzile> Pat is finally learning to Dodge
[2:55:15] <blowfishchunky> I love this game
[2:55:20] <%Jamejarrs> He's starting to believe
[2:55:27] <chrishansen69_> Ah well, back to pat killing old defenseless tai chi men
[2:55:33] <blowfishchunky> nice
[2:55:35] <+yoshkosh20> not sure if this is considered a spoiler, but you can spare the boss if you break his structure twice.
[2:55:36] <ToneBacas> nice tracking
[2:55:36] <TrashMammalVEVO> @valdorick oh that is the worst
[2:55:37] <blowfishchunky> I wanna see you be an old man
[2:55:37] <%Valdorick> He came on.
[2:55:38] <SomeAsianDood> @Pookiedaexzile crazy talk LUL
[2:55:41] <T_Sasquatch> @trashmammalvevo also some countries block porn so youtube and twitch provide an avenue
[2:55:42] <Pookiedaexzile> I stand corrected
[2:55:43] <blowfishchunky> old sifu is cool sifu
[2:55:43] <%nichos7> Bodied
[2:55:47] <chrishansen69_> Pat got wrecked
[2:55:49] <%AncelDeLambert> dodge it like a monster roar, Pat
[2:55:51] <+Rare_Ruiz> @cooldude69xx I think what the guy meant was that Sifu comes across as a very stereotypical kung-fu revenge thing, which doesn't sit well considering no Asian people were consulted in the making of it, so it comes across as inauthentic.
[2:55:51] <+Samurai_Sphinx> @joodatious are the controls relatively simple compared to say, Absolver?
[2:55:51] <%JoshManVGH> @jamejarrs Not hard enough I guess psaLol
[2:55:59] <+gustavozxd> so dodge is the real deal huh, I just parried everything and got my ass kicked anyway
[2:56:02] <wrydiculous> but hey, he did some good dodges
[2:56:04] <%chiazam> You can do more damage if you sway that
[2:56:07] <Ape_Law> nobody likes you when you're 23
[2:56:13] <blowfishchunky> how are you blocking a machete
[2:56:20] <blowfishchunky> yea
[2:56:25] <slix3431> Hey Pat, are you enjoying the fighting. I got a hernia today
[2:56:28] <+yoshkosh20> nobody likes me at 31.
[2:56:31] <%Jamejarrs> @joshmanvgh psaGotcha
[2:56:36] <blowfishchunky> same
[2:56:37] <@Fuggins4U> when Pat dies, everybody say "Sifu'd"
[2:56:40] <%JoshManVGH> @ape_law why not?
[2:56:43] <blowfishchunky> I think people like me even less the older I get
[2:56:48] <%JonathLP> 23!
[2:56:49] <GreenHerbWhiteSmoke> pat doing too much cool shit making game lag
[2:56:50] <chrishansen69_> Ape_Law, wait another 1000 years till your law takes effect
[2:56:50] <%cooldude69xx> @Rare_Ruiz Okay, but that isnt true. Even if it was true, its an obvious love letter to wuxia and hong kong cinema
[2:56:53] <T_Sasquatch> @rare_ruiz its almost like the game is an homage to classic kung fu movies
[2:56:57] <Pookiedaexzile> Bye Mad Dog
[2:56:59] <%baka_sugoi> 23 NICE
[2:57:00] <+yoshkosh20> it's the old person crankiness.
[2:57:01] <cnry_m> The cultural issue was that the Chinese aspects came off as an aesthetic and it’s just a good fighting game and revenge story with a king fu veneer over it
[2:57:01] <$velgaduere> pretty good tbh
[2:57:04] <Zaktheaussie> Hey pat, the secret badasses have a glow to their health bar, and some smoke coming from their shoulders, so if you don't do a finisher on them they won't activate
[2:57:07] <Aussie_Manny> nice
[2:57:10] <%Gogogolem> defeat him as a 5 year old
[2:57:16] <%twistedj3ster> I'm proud of Pat
[2:57:17] <wrydiculous> Getting better
[2:57:21] <GreenHerbWhiteSmoke> they have aura mokyNODDERS
[2:57:24] <Kaito_Cam> The 2nd phase is easier there are bamboo weapons on the groun
[2:57:26] <blowfishchunky> humiliation
[2:57:26] <@Moobot> Hey folks, just a reminder! If you have Twitch connected to Discord, you can access the PSA Sub-Discord. Go to your User Settings, go to Connections, and click 'Join' on the PSA server under the Twitch connection.
[2:57:27] <%D00msDayDan> so it's just your character aging and time isn't actually passing?
[2:57:27] <Kaito_Cam> ground*
[2:57:32] <Profmcstevie> If you were REALLY cool you'd go back to being 12 and kill him then
[2:57:33] <akitanito> so just cherry tap them to death?
[2:57:33] <chrishansen69_> Gogogolem, defeat em as they weak
[2:57:38] <+gustavozxd> yeah the trick is to not do a finisher on them so they don't activate DT
[2:57:41] <DefaultSettiings> defeat him with only eye contact you coward fayrunaPog
[2:57:45] <%cooldude69xx> @cnry_m So, a kung fu movie?
[2:57:47] <blowfishchunky> become the old man
[2:57:50] <+yoshkosh20> just smuggle a gun into the country. kung fu can't stand the superior gun fu
[2:57:50] <SomeAsianDood> @D00msDayDan yes he stands back up after being killed/knocked out visibly aged

[2:58:35] <%the_Punktuation> Remember you Need 2 focus bars for that.
[2:58:36] <blowfishchunky> that sounds pretty gay
[2:58:43] <%the_Punktuation> You need to grab a shire
[2:58:44] <chrishansen69_> DefaultSettiings, could've done it on 640x800
[2:58:44] <Pookiedaexzile> Remember the club shortcut
[2:58:44] <cnry_m> Look, I didn’t write the article, I just thought it added a perspective to the conversation
[2:58:45] <%the_Punktuation> gotcha
[2:58:46] <Xelhesia> how long is this game btw?
[2:58:49] <blowfishchunky> but I've been listening to a bunch of cumtown so everything's pretty gay lately

[2:59:40] <$velgaduere> did he spend his skill points before this level started? I looked away
[2:59:47] <+gustavozxd> best strat is to just rush in and beat the closest guy for an insta kill
[2:59:52] <%HunguyTV> elemental mastery fucks Kreygasm
[2:59:56] <blowfishchunky> speaking of die

[3:10:39] <+3d_pbandj> she didn't expect to fight a 31 year old man!
[3:10:40] <blowfishchunky> that's a joke. Don't do that
[3:10:40] <$velgaduere> Zangief enjoys the taste of de feet
[3:10:43] <+aWanderingKaivo> he's trying to defeet you

[3:10:52] <%maskofmichael> Zangief likes the taste of defeat
[3:10:58] <%DianaTheAscian> very cool
[3:10:58] <triangularblasphemy> sound and visuals
[3:10:59] <$PinkertonDanPie> @austonishing1 oh heck man. soundtrack drastically changes how a game feels and a hip hop soundtrack I feel would be so good for this game.
[3:11:00] <triangularblasphemy> nice
[3:11:01] <Pookiedaexzile> That's Backwards
[3:11:02] <%chiazam> I LOVE THIS PART
[3:11:10] <+2092049056> John Wick music starts playing...
[3:11:14] <Manwad> i wonder if speedrunners will deliberately age themselves to like 70 and just rock everyone with the bonus damage
[3:11:15] <akitanito> run away
[3:11:18] <Xelhesia> rad
[3:11:22] <cacophanes> when gun
[3:11:26] <user_naim> oh shit this lady

[3:11:30] <user_naim> oh fuck
[3:11:40] <professorarcana> @TheGoodTimeGirl because as you get older you supposedly become better at martial arts, like the stereotypical old master
[3:11:41] <$velgaduere> prepare for major doinkage
[3:11:41] <triangularblasphemy> Pain
[3:11:42] <+IAmSkeleton> she's for real
[3:11:44] <Grievousish> don't forget ya focus
[3:11:46] <StaceMcGate> Woolie bait is wrecking your shit Pat

[3:12:04] <+2092049056> Lady Butterfly PTSD with all these ladies punking you XD
[3:12:08] <blowfishchunky> the audio is real good
[3:12:10] <$velgaduere> cool camera
[3:12:12] <triangularblasphemy> She has so much health holy god
[3:12:18] <$PinkertonDanPie> they should release a Keanu Reeves skin that always looks the same age no matter how much older you get, for accuracy.
[3:12:18] <%IKilledADeadGuy> IKilledADeadGuy subscribed at Tier 1. They've subscribed for 58 months, currently on a 58 month streak! this game looks kinda cool actually, you enjoying it so far?
[3:12:25] <vulkans2> those wooden clap sounds are perfect
[3:12:27] <$velgaduere> nice
[3:12:29] <wrydiculous> oh she gonna school you on your dodges
[3:12:32] <T_Sasquatch> Camera no jutsu
[3:12:39] <+2092049056> John Wick suit with pencil included
[3:12:47] <user_naim> nice
[3:12:51] <blowfishchunky> is the game stressful?
[3:12:52] <wrydiculous> welp
[3:12:52] <randomlyalwaystired> What happened to your focus Kyle?!
[3:13:00] <T_Sasquatch> Deez
[3:13:02] <Pookiedaexzile> she also killed you
[3:13:07] <%the_Punktuation> Adds to the board
[3:13:08] <blowfishchunky> it seems  like once you learn it and develop a rhythm to it, it's like the besst game ever
[3:13:08] <%SharkMissile> clues
[3:13:09] <akitanito> random chinese words
[3:13:10] <%JonathLP> Voice lines not recorded yet
[3:13:10] <GreenHerbWhiteSmoke> DN
[3:13:11] <Grievousish> check board
[3:13:16] <Kaito_Cam> looore
[3:13:18] <coziestbank> That grafiti said "suck my ass"
[3:13:20] <%chiazam> That’s a bug
[3:13:22] <austonishing1> @PinkertonDanPie Yeah, I might be biased because I feel like the game's soundtrack is a little dry so far, but it would feel so good bopping skulls along to a beat
[3:13:31] <Grievousish> on your board
[3:13:33] <%chiazam> It’s supposed to give you a notification
[3:13:37] <person181> maybe the real clues were the asses we kicked along the way
[3:13:53] <zenith0111> Who was Sifu btw?
[3:13:59] <blowfishchunky> some of those transitions
[3:13:59] <GreenHerbWhiteSmoke> time to take the boss
[3:14:03] <blowfishchunky> are like the new macbeth movie
[3:14:04] <RaidenRising> is this karate souls?
[3:14:04] <%amaranthos> What happens if you hit like 100 years of age
[3:14:04] <joodatious> @zenith0111 you
[3:14:08] <%the_Punktuation> Time for the skill check!
[3:14:10] <blowfishchunky> really fluid
[3:14:11] <user_naim> I like this ost just the way it is
[3:14:11] <Kaito_Cam> time for da wall!
[3:14:15] <%the_Punktuation> Get ready. to get OLD
[3:14:16] <Grievousish> still gotta deal with these two yahoos
[3:14:16] <Aussie_Manny> No it's not.
[3:14:17] <Cobaltor_252> is this the fire nation or some shit
[3:14:22] <Aussie_Manny> Don't worry about it.
[3:14:25] <%chiazam> You missed the last trial
[3:14:27] <user_naim> alright here we go
[3:14:33] <Kaito_Cam> ready to seem him rapidly age
[3:14:33] <%SaiyanShoto> And here’s the hardest part of the level
[3:14:35] <%Calenrow> Calenrow subscribed at Tier 1. They've subscribed for 29 months! 
[3:14:37] <+TaifuDragon> you can
[3:14:37] <professorarcana> their hands a red
[3:14:39] <pi_in_the_sci> Cause it's orange
[3:14:39] <professorarcana> no parry
[3:14:42] <Pookiedaexzile> Pat refuses to Dodge
[3:14:44] <%WackyGear> have you been trying to pary the glowing ones
[3:14:44] <pi_in_the_sci> it's a dodge
[3:14:44] <+gustavozxd> good question
[3:14:45] <%maskofmichael> Because you're not good
[3:14:45] <+manic_raven> can't parry red?
[3:14:45] <austonishing1> you can't parry those because you're not daigo
[3:14:46] <+IAmSkeleton> the 3rd attack is a guardbreaker, it needs tighter timing and comes at a delay
[3:14:46] <+Fidranth> window is shorter on glowing attacks I think
[3:14:47] <SomeAsianDood> Not enough structure I think
[3:14:48] <$velgaduere> he might actually not make it past this
[3:14:48] <Grievousish> can't parry glow attacks. gotta dodge
[3:14:50] <%chiazam> THE RED PAT
[3:14:54] <Profmcstevie> The third hit every time is orange you colour blind ginger
[3:14:56] <joodatious> SHE TOOK YOUR STICK
[3:15:11] <JhinBappo> I'm a little late to the stream. This is that Absolver company game, right?
[3:15:12] <blowfishchunky> I like that it doesn't wait for you either
[3:15:14] <SquiglyBattleOpera> I'M GLAD I'M NOT THE ONLY ONE ASKING THAT
[3:15:17] <Xelhesia> wow
[3:15:18] <blowfishchunky> it'
[3:15:19] <JhinBappo> Like, the latest one they made?
[3:15:23] <%greasypete00> midlife time
[3:15:24] <blowfishchunky> it's like palying against real people
[3:15:25] <Pookiedaexzile> Dodge or Die
[3:15:27] <$PinkertonDanPie> pats character just has the Foxdie virus and it's causing him to prematurely age. on the top floor you fight liquid ocelot.
[3:15:29] <JhinBappo> Or is it a different company?
[3:15:43] <professorarcana> this game is dark souls, pat. dodging is better than blocking
[3:15:50] <WyvernsArentDragons> when you punch a guy so hard he gets up with a beard
[3:15:52] <blowfishchunky> every character iss like fighting a boss
[3:15:55] <StaceMcGate> combo'd
[3:16:03] <TheGoodTimeGirl> do the enemies also age when you age
[3:16:05] <RaidenRising> kung fu souls
[3:16:06] <blowfishchunky> yo, that would be cool
[3:16:11] <%the_Punktuation> This dude age'n numbers.
[3:16:11] <%RigmaroleHM> Oh no father time
[3:16:12] <RaidenRising> boomer time
[3:16:14] <Pookiedaexzile> D to the O to the DGE
[3:16:15] <%shurtal> I'm dying squirtle
[3:16:15] <Aussie_Manny> oh lordy, he dyin'
[3:16:17] <plaest2k> i love how the enemies' reactions act as like DMC's rating system
[3:16:18] <+IAmSkeleton> start dodging like it's God Hand basically
[3:16:21] <blowfishchunky> if you had to fight a guy to the death benjamin button style
[3:16:30] <tanarath> Perhaps learning to dodge is the issue
[3:16:30] <blowfishchunky> that needs to be the final boss
[3:16:39] <user_naim> that kick cost me six years asshole
[3:16:46] <+3d_pbandj> oh no, this old man wants in the club
[3:16:48] <+The_Death_Owl> old man pat can beat this
[3:16:50] <%the_Punktuation> Dodge
[3:16:52] <%baka_sugoi> HE WANT TO WRESTLE
[3:17:00] <Kaito_Cam> @blowfishchunky That's already a thing made by he same devs it's called obsolver
[3:17:01] <%RigmaroleHM> What's the oldest you can get to?
[3:17:02] <CaptainBlinkKold> They hit you so hard they knocked a decade off you
[3:17:05] <blowfishchunky> are you talking to the dog or me?
[3:17:09] <+The_Death_Owl> 70
[3:17:10] <RaidenRising> oh no a boomer
[3:17:11] <SomeAsianDood> 76 I think @RigmaroleHM
[3:17:23] <+IAmSkeleton> your dodges need to be on point in this fight
[3:17:24] <Grievousish> time to fight Ozai
[3:17:28] <%AncelDeLambert> wow, what a fuckhead
[3:17:31] <tanarath> This game is great
[3:17:33] <Xelhesia> MAKOTO SHISHIO?
[3:17:35] <$PinkertonDanPie> go up in age enough and you will have a back pain meter and have to smoke cigs to reduce stress, just like hideo kojima would have wanted...
[3:17:40] <arkv01> sifu wtf
[3:17:41] <SomeAsianDood> @The_Death_Owl if you die at 70+ game over. But you can pass 70 by bleeding over
[3:17:42] <%baka_sugoi> PogChamp
[3:17:42] <chia233> pat is not going to be able to finish the 3rd stage
[3:17:43] <Hoaxfish> chinese burn

[3:17:49] <%chiazam> BURNING
[3:17:50] <Aussie_Manny> He's a firebender.
[3:17:55] <Shockmaster182> Because cigarettes are cool
[3:17:55] <arkv01> WEAK
[3:17:58] <Kaito_Cam> @RigmaroleHM any death after 70 is game over highest i've seen is like78
[3:17:59] <tanarath> A school for the orb

[3:19:00] <%cade_calrayn> don't let it set in
[3:19:08] <Kaito_Cam> This game feels like it's karate kid making you repeat the levels and getting the repeated action to get better.
[3:19:09] <user_naim> no stick today, my sifu’s gone away
[3:19:12] <%solracc25> Sifu mode

[3:24:45] <TheFramedWarlock> @blowfishchunky Each death is worth more years. First it increases, then you age so if your counter is at 0, you die, it goes up to 1 you age 1 year. Next time it goes up 1, you age 2 years etc. etc. There are special enemies that take a year away from the counter
[3:24:45] <$PinkertonDanPie> imagine beating up an old man, and when you kick his ass he ages 6 years and gets up even angrier. How many times we gotta teach you this lesson, progressively older man!
[3:24:46] <CaptainBlinkKold> That guy can now say "I once hit a guy so hard, he aged into his 70's and died"
[3:24:48] <akitanito> it's more like a schump
[3:24:50] <blowfishchunky> it would be cool if it was a roguelike
[3:24:51] <professorarcana> yeah
[3:24:57] <%Cozy90> Thats hot
[3:25:07] <joodatious> This is why in Yakuza the Chinese are big evil. they have magic kong fu powers
[3:25:07] <TheFramedWarlock> It is kind of a roguelike
[3:25:22] <%maskofmichael> cut your lip into pieces, this is your last resort
[3:25:22] <%chiazam> THE GAME IS DOING DAMAGE TO YOU IN REAL LIFE
[3:25:23] <DubDevilPlays> this game reminds me of that fighting movie called chocolate
[3:25:27] <+BIumen> @joodatious unlike kriyu who uses normal magic kung fu
[3:25:29] <Shockmaster182> THIS PARTYS GETTING CRAZY
[3:25:29] <professorarcana> no money no goods
[3:25:29] <StaceMcGate> its not procedurally generated however, but you retain skills from previous runs
[3:25:30] <TheFramedWarlock> You go through the levels with temporary buffs, and you have to start each level at the year you reached them
[3:25:30] <joodatious> game fun play more game
[3:25:34] <%the_Punktuation> The Squats is a good place to farm XP.
[3:25:34] <%DoomUnderTheStairs> that's the way pat
[3:25:48] <pi_in_the_sci> You need to do it till you beat it at 20
[3:25:52] <majindusto> GOTTA GO FAST
[3:25:52] <%amaranthos> @joodatious His magic kungfu never kills people so it's all good
[3:25:55] <person181> is the MC in this ALSO weak to electricity?
[3:25:58] <Manwad> does anyone know if you start at your like, best year per level?
[3:25:58] <blowfishchunky> those guys are basically asking to be punched
[3:26:09] <blowfishchunky> why do they just wait for you to punch them?
[3:26:09] <TheFramedWarlock> So if you got to level 2 at 60, you can either replay level 2 at 60 or replay level 1 at 20 and hope you get to level 2 at a lower age
[3:26:12] <+gustavozxd> you know technically you don't have to play the game you can just turn it off 4Head
[3:26:14] <+madthing_17> has he found the short cuts yet chat ?
[3:26:17] <TheFramedWarlock> So you can get a better checkpoint
[3:26:28] <%DoomUnderTheStairs> I believe so
[3:26:30] <sackerkappa> Hit them with that Raid tech.
[3:26:32] <professorarcana> he found shortcuts he's just grinding for xp
[3:26:35] <Parapattern> Hallway!
[3:26:35] <TheeCanadienEh> god I love old boy corridor so much
[3:26:37] <TheeRabbi> God the hits are so meaty
[3:26:39] <Aussie_Manny> Youngboy
[3:26:46] <joodatious> and this is why you always play from the squats
[3:26:55] <Manwad> I love how hard you can clown on everything
[3:26:55] <%DoomUnderTheStairs> young man
[3:26:55] <mar_krow> Knife to leg
[3:27:02] <BigFingerRo> what's the rating for this game?
[3:27:05] <mortificent> yeyeyeyeye
[3:27:05] <TheeCanadienEh> Why would you ever want to skip THE HALLWAY tho
[3:27:11] <TheeCanadienEh> gud/10
[3:27:17] <Frostofthecwsw> ...the game glitches and now I have to forfeit. cool
[3:27:18] <sackerkappa> Oldboy: Now with 30% less live squid eating
[3:27:20] <$PinkertonDanPie> why don't you get a skill tree for Jackie Chan style improvised ladder combat.
[3:27:23] <GreenHerbWhiteSmoke> the hallway is FREE EXP
[3:27:25] <person181> skill
[3:27:27] <+xilmarinenx> What a massacre
[3:27:27] <@Moobot> Hey folks, just a reminder! If you have Twitch connected to Discord, you can access the PSA Sub-Discord. Go to your User Settings, go to Connections, and click 'Join' on the PSA server under the Twitch connection.
[3:27:27] <BigFingerRo> I've noticed there's not a lot of cursing
[3:27:28] <snow_soldier> That was so sick
[3:27:29] <Parapattern> Fuck
[3:27:30] <pi_in_the_sci> I clapped
[3:27:31] <%BakiinPlaysStuff> Hot damn that looked cool
[3:27:31] <TheeRabbi> But honestly, I love how there's a 'toughness' rating of who can take my crowbar hits to the face. Like, have you ever seen what a crowbar can do to a face in ONE hit?
[3:27:32] <%DianaTheAscian> Nice
[3:27:32] <+PlushMines> that was SICK
[3:27:34] <TheFramedWarlock> That nailed
[3:27:34] <StaceMcGate> Pat was holding his breath during that
[3:27:36] <%amaranthos> nyannHypers nyannHypers
[3:27:40] <majindusto> Hallway  Fights are a MUST
[3:27:41] <+madthing_17> @TheeCanadienEh to get a lower age with lower risk
[3:27:43] <BigFingerRo> and the executions are pretty tame
[3:27:43] <Manwad> GAMER
[3:27:44] <blowfishchunky> I love this game a lot
[3:27:46] <user_naim> jesus christ that was nice
[3:27:50] <StaceMcGate> out of breath with that "yes"
[3:27:51] <cnry_m> Nice
[3:27:55] <blowfishchunky> those hallway entrances are really good
[3:27:57] <JhinBappo> THAT WAS CLEAN
[3:27:59] <pi_in_the_sci> Rememebr, not the gate first
[3:28:04] <mar_krow> Pat that was pretty good
[3:28:05] <TheeCanadienEh> @madthing_17 ya but thats not worth the coolness loss
[3:28:10] <%RigmaroleHM> LUL
[3:28:16] <%chiazam> Will Pat get a score of 5,000 this run? Probably not
[3:28:17] <professorarcana> everything just looks like it reeeaaalllyy hurts
[3:28:17] <sackerkappa> BROOM COMBOS
[3:28:17] <blowfishchunky> it's almost as if someone should step out into the hallway from behind a wall or something
[3:28:27] <TheeCanadienEh> @BigFingerRo same wit how it is in kung fu flix
[3:28:29] <%patriotrenegade> do combo
[3:28:31] <@Ranryu692> ouch

[3:28:38] <majindusto> BROOM'D
[3:28:38] <joodatious> the secret reward for beating the game should be a metal bat that doesn't break lol
[3:28:38] <TheeRabbi> Yo you just crippled that girl
[3:28:39] <%MidnightBurst12> she's dead
[3:28:40] <%amaranthos> she didn't even do anything
[3:28:46] <Sunriser41> jesus this game is brutal

[3:29:39] <BigFingerRo> @BigFingerRo Not a complaint, just an observation. I just kind of expected this game to be , idk, more like sleeping puppers in that regard
[3:29:40] <%chiazam> Oh

[3:34:05] <+Jack8274> You should sympathize with balding men Pat
[3:34:07] <RaidenRising> ouch
[3:34:09] <blackbaron98> How dare he be old
[3:34:13] <CaptainBlinkKold> Funny how when you have a guy down on the ground and punching him in the head you help him back up so he can punch you too

[3:34:55] <Parapattern> Says badass one-liner and immediately eats shit
[3:35:09] <GreenHerbWhiteSmoke> if you get really sick with it you start taking years away from your character
[3:35:10] <$PinkertonDanPie> what if this is just a metaphor for the capitalist corporate ladder, where you try to eff over as many people as you can before you die of old age?
[3:35:12] <blackbaron98> Stake the stick back
[3:35:25] <%Paralurx> Paralurx subscribed at Tier 1. They've subscribed for 46 months! Make the funnies for my amusement, internet video game man!

[3:39:52] <%cha0tic_klutch> Directional throw is great on this boss
[3:40:01] <%SveriSageAdvice> except it *has* grabbed Woolie's attention so it's very much in his wheelhouse
[3:40:17] <neraren> So bosses are Sekiro style?
[3:40:21] <%SveriSageAdvice> what you want is a melee game with style
[3:40:39] <voodoolawyer> I'm already 25 and I haven't constructed my Boss Arena what am I doing with my life
[3:40:54] <StaceMcGate> age 23

[3:41:45] <$Mekhet09> Beard but that's it.
[3:41:48] <%Agami23> so do people in this have magic powers specifically to make cool places to fight?
[3:41:50] <joodatious> pat started to go bald at 23
[3:41:51] <%cade_calrayn> you'd have to have hair for that, Pat
[3:41:54] <voodoolawyer> the Vergiling is a slow process man you think you just BECOME grey haired?
[3:41:56] <%SovPho> lol my beard has been gray since i turned 23
[3:41:58] <WillSin4Cash> so is dodgingd better than parry 'cause Ive been trying to sekiro this game & getting my ass kicked
[3:42:01] <%SovPho> err graying*
[3:42:04] <%Bluwizard21> my grandpa had pure white hair at 24, he was 1/2 cherokee though so
[3:42:06] <%DianaTheAscian> I have 2 grey streaks and I'm 21
[3:42:10] <$Mekhet09> Man that stick makes this a lot easier.
[3:42:14] <$PinkertonDanPie> have you tried ACTing instead of FIGHTing these people? you might get a better ending.
[3:42:18] <TrashMammalVEVO> My dad is in his 40s and he has less gray hair
[3:42:32] <+gustavozxd> you can spare him
[3:42:33] <FoolproofDread> 24, got like.... 4? 5?
[3:42:34] <GreenHerbWhiteSmoke> 8 years Pog
[3:42:36] <$velgaduere> @PatStaresAt okay, now don't forget to spend your skill points
[3:42:37] <Saltmeisterr> nice
[3:42:38] <ArOne_Start> it's called having a reality marble so they can make these cool fight zones
[3:42:43] <majindusto> DECAPITATION!!!!
[3:42:46] <+xilmarinenx> You can spare all bosses
[3:42:48] <+RainFerret> yup
[3:42:51] <neraren> if you died a bunch would you say "I spent 50 long years"?
[3:42:51] <voodoolawyer> You just chopped his head off and you got a "Kill Nil" achievement??
[3:42:51] <+xilmarinenx> You have to break him twice
[3:42:52] <Sigma_190_Beta> Yeah, every boss has a pacifist route @PatStaresAt
[3:42:55] <+gustavozxd> you get a dialogue prompt when he's at low health
[3:42:56] <sonuke_draws> stress does a lot
[3:42:59] <+xilmarinenx> FOR THE GOOD ENDING PAT
[3:43:01] <joodatious> killing is always the way
[3:43:01] <Profmcstevie> Murder isn't very Kung Fu pat
[3:43:04] <%Valdorick> To stop the cycle of vengence, Pat.
[3:43:05] <%solracc25> -1
[3:43:06] <%DianaTheAscian> @PatStaresAt bosses have different endings apparently
[3:43:08] <GreenHerbWhiteSmoke> because he isnt the actual villian
[3:43:09] <@DakotaMacDoodle> I mean he is magic advanced aging tho
[3:43:09] <pi_in_the_sci> Maybe he gives you a good thing
[3:43:10] <TheFramedWarlock> You can spare all the bosses if you just break their posture over and over
[3:43:10] <%MidnightBurst12> "morals"
[3:43:12] <+Catpurnicus> Kill them all, Peter
[3:43:15] <tanarath> Why would you want to see if there's a different ending?
[3:43:16] <voodoolawyer> The Dishonored rule?
[3:43:16] <$PinkertonDanPie> to romance the skeleton
[3:43:17] <Pookiedaexzile> Murder is Super KungFu
[3:43:18] <vulkans2> they didn't call it Spare Bill
[3:43:18] <%za7az> Something, something, break the cycle of violence and revenge?
[3:43:22] <Parapattern> I'm gonna kill him dead. Like...with a rock or something
[3:43:22] <%chiazam> Spoiler
[3:43:33] <IzanagiNoOokami> Revenge is cool tho.
[3:43:33] <+gustavozxd> yeah me too
[3:43:33] <omnishadeee> get good ending in another playthrough no need to worry about it on first
[3:43:38] <+xilmarinenx> do it like a man, kill everyone, level up max and then mercy them when you are BIG STRONG
[3:43:39] <%baka_sugoi> TO DA CLUB
[3:43:46] <pi_in_the_sci> It's an extra difficulty spike, do it perfect with mercy
[3:43:50] <%baka_sugoi> GURL IS NICE

[4:02:06] <%baka_sugoi> I bet he's gonna have a BLAST
[4:02:08] <%thebeargoesHONK> time to lab
[4:02:08] <Neri011> Was that the end of the game?
[4:02:09] <%Valdorick> Man, fuck the people who are going to beat the game at 20, imagine the people who go to 70 instantly and just fucking body everyone.
[4:02:09] <plaest2k> god i can't wait to see that
[4:02:09] <%RetroCop87> Jesus, Woolie is going to be 0 progress
[4:02:10] <Zebroneath> Will take A BIT
[4:02:12] <%DashXero> Woolie won't have too much trouble.
[4:02:13] <%marvel877> Woolie's fucked.
[4:02:18] <nipplestheenchilada96> i was expecting woolie LP-ing the Woolie game
[4:02:19] <joodatious> @bootysteve game over
[4:02:19] <TheFramedWarlock> Woolie's gonna mark out
[4:02:21] <tanarath> Woolie will try.
[4:02:21] <%maskofmichael> @plaest2k Why wouldn't he
[4:02:22] <%boggycrook> Right after Everhood? Damn
[4:02:26] <%DoomUnderTheStairs> Woolie will be just fine with this
[4:02:31] <jumpyhugs> @Neri011 NOPE
[4:02:32] <Pookiedaexzile> Woolie might Ace this in one
[4:02:39] <majindusto> THE WOOLIE WAY
[4:02:40] <%DianaTheAscian> I can't wait for Wooile to overthink the aging mechanic
[4:02:40] <TheFramedWarlock> Woolie's crazy good at action games though, he'll be fine
[4:02:41] <ShinBojangles> dissapointed theres no oxygen tank martial arts in this
[4:02:43] <CaptainBlinkKold> Woolie will spend hours in trianing mode labbing
[4:02:43] <$PinkertonDanPie> one foot in the grave. piggie dippin in the skellie pond.
[4:02:43] <wrydiculous> wilk woolie figure it out though
[4:02:44] <+kaladins_sad> anyone beat the game at age 20 yet?
[4:02:48] <%DoomUnderTheStairs> seriously one run done at 20
[4:02:53] <plaest2k> @maskofmichael oh i wasn't doubting that he would, just really looking forward to seeing him suffer
[4:02:54] <%marvel877> We all thought Woolie would be fine with Arkham, look how that turned out.
[4:02:55] <TheFramedWarlock> Plus he loves royal guard and parries and shit
[4:03:08] <%RetroCop87> do the people saying Woolie will do good remember how well he handled Batman combat?
[4:03:11] <%DoomUnderTheStairs> arkham is different
[4:03:21] <%RetroCop87> but it's also similar
[4:03:22] <plaest2k> @kaladins_sad i got to the museum at 20 but kuroki is kicking my ass
[4:03:27] <devanmuse> i was gone a bit. did Pat wrap it up for the night?
[4:03:27] <TheFramedWarlock> This isn't Arkham combat
[4:03:34] <majindusto> Remember  how trash Woolie was at Arkham...Yeah
[4:03:36] <%the_Punktuation> this is more of a fighting game, anyway.
[4:03:48] <%DoomUnderTheStairs> ^^
[4:03:50] <wrydiculous> @retrocop87 Exactly he's gonna be rudely awakened
[4:03:52] <%maskofmichael> Woolie while playing Sifu: "Okay hold on, hold on, hold on, hold on, hold on, hold on, hold on, hold on.
[4:03:55] <ahaegotrigger> yeah its missing the bat zipline
[4:04:07] <%the_Punktuation> think Yakuza and sleeping dogs, less beatem up thou
[4:04:09] <plaest2k> woolie counting frames and zoning 10 different enemies at once
[4:04:12] <TheFramedWarlock> There's gonna be a lot of respecting bosses
[4:04:32] <%RetroCop87> if Reggie is playing, they'll be done in one night due to dumb luck
[4:04:35] <%DoomUnderTheStairs> ^^
[4:04:37] <%DoomUnderTheStairs> for sure
[4:04:47] <+ProfessorPuzzle> Woolie would constantly go for the parry and it would not end well
[4:05:03] <%DashXero> Sifu is a better Shenmue.
[4:05:04] <majindusto> Lucky Reggie finds a way
[4:05:05] <%Valdorick> You mean the Sleeping Dog's Kung Fu Movie DLC?
[4:05:10] <plaest2k> @ProfessorPuzzle oh god you're right...
[4:05:11] <auraoftheearth009> I found out something interesting about this game looking up vids on yt
[4:05:13] <%marvel877> But no Dog Eyes
[4:05:14] <%DashXero> An infinitely better Shenmue.
[4:05:21] <ElSuperNova> Glad you're enjoying it
[4:05:22] <%RigmaroleHM> Think you'll play more on  your own?
[4:05:22] <wrydiculous> Sleeping Dogs is hella forgiving compared to thus
[4:05:24] <OvaltineDream> Good job Sloclap
[4:05:24] <+Kharinite> Thanks for the stream!
[4:05:29] <akitanito> it's great for watching people who are good at the game
[4:05:30] <majindusto> BRUTAL
[4:05:31] <%SaiyanShoto> To me it got easier after the club
[4:05:31] <%Bluwizard21> just wish it was on steam
[4:05:41] <plaest2k> @auraoftheearth009 what's that?
[4:05:42] <akitanito> just wait a few days for the free version
[4:05:48] <+Papafleish> yeah

[4:05:50] <+Karamsky> its so fun

[4:05:54] <%the_Punktuation> no frigging idea
[4:05:55] <GoodnightSnek> Lost Ark releases on the 11th so not a long wait
[4:05:56] <Mundkipz> sifu feels like returnal.. but mellee instead of guns
[4:05:59] <+TheMeromex> people that have played it before say its good
[4:05:59] <%Bluwizard21> all i can think of is ark survival
[4:06:01] <ElSuperNova> I've heard mid to good
[4:06:02] <Zeif00> Lost Ark Good
[4:06:02] <+xilmarinenx> I plaed the RU version. Its so good
[4:06:04] <%DoomUnderTheStairs> ask Jenna she was playing
[4:06:04] <zzNamttamzz> It's Lost Ark, it's been around forever
[4:06:05] <irziggo> i enjoy it a lot but i'm a big fan of arpgs
[4:06:11] <+Eizack> How is my cousin already playing it?
[4:06:11] <%DianaTheAscian> yeah
[4:06:12] <DXLelouch24> @PatStaresAt watch the directors Trailer, trust me it flipped my opinion
[4:06:12] <@SSaryn> Founders get it 3 days early.
[4:06:16] <+TheMeromex> and i mean Korean one
[4:06:16] <+A0N33> Yeah today's the 8th
[4:06:21] <@SSaryn> Servers have been perfectly fine and it's actually legitimately good.
[4:06:24] <majindusto> BARK?
[4:06:26] <%maskofmichael> Lost Bark
[4:06:28] <@DakotaMacDoodle> I'm going to go watch The Raid now
[4:06:33] <+Eizack> That'll do it.
[4:06:34] <@SSaryn> They've also been on the ball and added a server to NA EAst.
[4:06:35] <%DoomUnderTheStairs> yas
[4:06:37] <GoodnightSnek> The packs grant early access
[4:06:39] <%Bluwizard21> MATH!
[4:06:39] <%DianaTheAscian> yes Pat
[4:06:52] <majindusto> lol
[4:07:03] <%Bluwizard21> 11-3 is 8 pat
[4:07:07] <@SSaryn> Also cementing how bad New World got shafted by not only Amazon Games but themselves as well.
[4:07:09] <akitanito> are you on the list?
[4:07:11] <majindusto> Hmmmm?
[4:07:12] <azure_dunes> big maths
[4:07:18] <+AgniBrandt> @PatStaresAt Importantly, Lost Ark has controller support
[4:07:25] <%MegadBlitz> lost ark more like lost...ah
[4:07:25] <majindusto> THE LIST THO
[4:07:30] <%Broand> Oh dude, the leagues always line up horribly with other releases
[4:07:31] <akitanito> I guess they are direct competitors
[4:07:37] <%RigmaroleHM> LUL
[4:07:38] <%DianaTheAscian> Is lost ark another diablo thingy?
[4:07:39] <%cvp5127> whats lost ark?
[4:07:41] <@SSaryn> I will say, COLLECTABLES ARE A BIG FUCKING THING in this game.
[4:07:44] <$Mekhet09> They really aren't the same.
[4:07:47] <@SSaryn> It's a sub basically.
[4:07:49] <DXLelouch24> @PatStaresAt Lost Ark has controller support so you can use a big old giant monitor
[4:08:08] <$Mekhet09> It's a korean MMO.
[4:08:12] <ElSuperNova> The strimmer packl
[4:08:18] <majindusto> "Losers"
[4:08:18] <+Caidezes> it's Korean, yes.
[4:08:22] <DXLelouch24> @PatStaresAt also your mind goblins may hate you as we get Korok Seeds 2.0
[4:08:26] <+swills6> perfectly said
[4:08:29] <DXLelouch24> 1200 SEEDS
[4:08:30] <akitanito> korean p2w mmo is scary
[4:08:38] <@SSaryn> 1209 Seeds specifically.
[4:08:49] <DXLelouch24> close enough
[4:08:51] <majindusto> OH GOD, KOROK SEEDS
[4:08:57] <%DashXero> So, what's the appeal of Lost Ark?
[4:09:06] <$PinkertonDanPie> Korean f2p p2w games worry me
[4:09:07] <DXLelouch24> amazing i hear but menu you need mouse
[4:09:07] <@SSaryn> Works perfectly fine. Though KB+M is also good.
[4:09:11] <akitanito> no response lol
[4:09:32] <DXLelouch24> this GUY LOVES HIS JOB
[4:09:32] <@SSaryn> Menuing is a big part of it though as well so KB+M may be a thing you wanna think about.
[4:09:35] <%rumtumtugnutz> Controller support is great
[4:09:38] <DXLelouch24> absolute Chad
[4:09:39] <+xilmarinenx> That video is worth it being honest
[4:09:45] <%lightbringrrrr> which game?
[4:09:46] <@SSaryn> 18 minutes is basically showing you, hey here's everything we have to offer.
[4:09:53] <%rumtumtugnutz> But you have to do the intro stuff mouse and keyboard
[4:09:56] <@SSaryn> That's still fine.
[4:10:00] <majindusto> So pat, you gonna watch  the Direct  tomorrow?
[4:10:04] <@Ranryu692> ah yes, the "FF XIV"
[4:10:06] <%maskofmichael> so the Woolie way?
[4:10:06] <%Bluwizard21> Then your a DS2 speedrunner
[4:10:10] <%rumtumtugnutz> But like
[4:10:11] <+ReallyBigRocks> one hand on mouse one hand on controller
[4:10:11] <Ell1ot> Woolie's setup?
[4:10:16] <%RigmaroleHM> That's how I play FFXIV honestly
[4:10:21] <akitanito> do it like woolie with half controller and keyboard
[4:10:22] <DXLelouch24> @PatStaresAt Directors trailer is good shit trust me
[4:10:22] <%RetroCop87> idiots had "Switch 2" trending today

[4:11:00] <majindusto> SWITCH 2? enigmaKEK
[4:11:08] <%rumtumtugnutz> But Native Controller support is nice
[4:11:13] <@SSaryn> It gives you a legit look at what Lost Ark has to offer and I can guarantee you, you will lose it at some of this shit.

[4:16:36] <ElPlasa> how to eat hot chip and lie
[4:16:38] <%cvp5127> give chip
[4:16:43] <neraren> You can blame me if you want idc
[4:16:44] <Louie_Salmon> Lost Ark seems neat except its story is absolutely abysmal, like more generic and inconsequential than Genshin Impact
[4:16:46] <%amaranthos> tfw no chip
[4:16:49] <@SSaryn> Hey man, this is of your own volition and I will NOT be held accountable for how good it feels.
[4:16:50] <42nfl19> wait this is also from Amazon?
[4:16:52] <akitanito> it's fine
[4:16:53] <leinadtonu> G A M E S
[4:16:59] <@SSaryn> Nah this is good.
[4:17:00] <person181> BIG DUB\
[4:17:02] <@SSaryn> Sound gud
[4:17:04] <CaptainBlinkKold> Looks like a less good Diablo
[4:17:05] <akitanito> GOLDRIVER
[4:17:08] <stormhawk9891> no
[4:17:12] <+Jack8274> There you go
[4:17:18] <neraren> Korean names are super simple actually
[4:17:18] <stormhawk9891> you are kun
[4:17:20] <azure_dunes> HE'S SO COOL
[4:17:20] <%RigmaroleHM> Oh no
[4:17:25] <person181> oh gods this is ALREADY SOOO KOREAN
[4:17:25] <%DianaTheAscian> The va reminds me of the monhun live letters
[4:17:28] <+swills6> happy!
[4:17:28] <+xilmarinenx> This guys is considered to be the Korean Yoshi-P
[4:17:31] <Louie_Salmon> Gotta do big animation
[4:17:31] <ElPlasa> that was literally mishima dojo
[4:17:32] <%Djinnazz> cuz
[4:17:32] <%DianaTheAscian> they do
[4:17:35] <LordGeneric> Korean MMO's love their shiny leather people
[4:17:36] <%Valdorick> Its the SoCalArt of video games.
[4:17:36] <Make_me_mad> This looks like Diablo but Tera.
[4:17:37] <%amaranthos> very korean
[4:17:37] <+swills6> (fake) happy!
[4:17:40] <stormhawk9891> they do don't they but shhhhh
[4:17:42] <leinadtonu> Cultural thing?
[4:17:44] <@SSaryn> Cause Korea really likes everything and anything and does its best to make it look cool.
[4:17:44] <$PinkertonDanPie> it's so true. pats right
[4:17:45] <+toastybites> why do korean games always have gender-locked classes
[4:17:47] <%cvp5127> LUL
[4:17:49] <%RetroCop87> listen Pat, once you've been playing for 72 hours straight, all Korean MMO's look the same
[4:17:49] <%DianaTheAscian> 1
[4:17:51] <person181> 1?
[4:17:51] <akitanito> WON
[4:17:51] <%kyh9> They're not being made with artistic intent, they're being made to emulate what Koreans think an anime MMO should be like
[4:17:51] <DXLelouch24> Lost Ark has FAT ASSES tho
[4:17:53] <+rdark_ksu> yea, this is very much a specific type of look
[4:17:54] <DXLelouch24> HUGE
[4:17:56] <LordGeneric> Cause 1 is a magic number~
[4:17:56] <Xelhesia> 1
[4:17:57] <42nfl19> JUAN
[4:18:00] <%Bluwizard21> @PatStaresAt Cause they haven't gotten past the chuuni phase like japan. we had that phase during ff7 but korea just reached it
[4:18:08] <majindusto> RED MOON
[4:18:09] <@SSaryn> Whaddaya mean Kappa
[4:18:11] <%kyh9> Lost Ark, Blade and Soul, Black Desert, the other ones, they're all the fucking same
[4:18:13] <%kyh9> TERA
[4:18:15] <42nfl19> INGINITY STONES
[4:18:15] <Make_me_mad> The moon turning red is always sick.
[4:18:16] <Xelhesia> this looks ;ike Cabal
[4:18:17] <%kyh9> These games are all the same
[4:18:18] <%shurtal> kamidogu?!?!?
[4:18:21] <Cobaltor_252> CHAOS EMERALDS
[4:18:22] <TheFramedWarlock> Bruh come on
[4:18:22] <neraren> Two blues and 0 oranges, trash game
[4:18:22] <%maskofmichael> KINGDOM HEARTS
[4:18:25] <%Noir_Valdr> they look the same because that aestehtic is cool as shit
[4:18:27] <ahaegotrigger> this is like a ripoff of Morecock
[4:18:28] <+Jack8274> They wanted to tame Dinosaurs
[4:18:30] <+OmegaFatalis> HEAR FEEL THINK
[4:18:31] <leinadtonu> Los Tark!

[4:18:36] <joodatious> the mother crystal
[4:18:36] <%DianaTheAscian> oh the stutter isn't me
[4:18:36] <%kyh9> Because they're all trying to be what koreans think MMOs should be like from manhua/manga
[4:18:38] <42nfl19> the BIGGEST?
[4:18:38] <%Valdorick> Her big BONE
[4:18:40] <SomeStrangeBroad> is it a space game?
[4:18:42] <akitanito> paige must have her porn
[4:18:43] <azure_dunes> CHAOS
[4:18:45] <@Ranryu692> Kamehameha!

[4:18:48] <TheFramedWarlock> Chaos ?
[4:19:02] <Psyramics> kzxChaos
[4:19:03] <42nfl19> Wait a minute, why would Paige need porn if she has Pat?
[4:19:07] <@SSaryn> You're gonna learn you some cool art direction.
[4:19:08] <%kyh9> Is it too much to ask a game to start small and focused?
[4:19:08] <akitanito> wait, what happened to the red moon
[4:19:08] <+UltraViolet371> hear feel think much?
[4:19:08] <$PinkertonDanPie> gunlance shown in trailer when?

[4:19:35] <stormhawk9891> C L A S S
[4:19:37] <$PinkertonDanPie> Light = true
[4:19:39] <joodatious> i worry this is gonna make the actual game look like shit by comparison
[4:19:41] <Louie_Salmon> She totally had a little earpiece with a microphone, what the hell
[4:19:42] <@SSaryn> I should mention, there's literally a class that is Gunlancer.
[4:19:44] <+Larry_Q> this intro feels a little bloated
[4:19:45] <ShinBojangles> LOOK AT THE GOOF TROOP
[4:19:45] <%JoshManVGH> I don't have it
[4:19:45] <djblue_shift> the director's name literally translates to gold river lol
[4:19:45] <neraren> That town looked like yellow irithyll
[4:19:48] <person181> i got 20 bits on gender locked classes
[4:19:48] <42nfl19> @seaearthandsky wow rude lol
[4:19:49] <%maskofmichael> they're too shiny

[4:20:01] <%Agami23> why does this guy sound like a nintendo direct?
[4:20:01] <%Bluwizard21> @PatStaresAt That was the opening to lord of the rings, except they said the same thing 5 times instead of actual narrative
[4:20:01] <mrtanaka111> looks like a scuffed ffxiv
[4:20:02] <+seaearthandsky> @42nfl19 limesGiggle
[4:20:02] <%RayReborne> OK DIABLO
[4:20:03] <%cade_calrayn> this narrator is cringe
[4:20:06] <%Noir_Valdr> yo
[4:20:07] <Louie_Salmon> Yeah this is the one good part
[4:20:08] <%rumtumtugnutz> they look like bootleg ffxiv characters

[4:20:12] <+swills6> kewl!
[4:20:12] <%JoshManVGH> Korean for sure, those hips don't lie
[4:20:14] <joodatious> this is pretty cringe
[4:20:19] <+kewlmyc> This looks more like Diablo than a MMO
[4:20:21] <leinadtonu> shiny
[4:20:26] <%Valdorick> Burst their 'speciality'?
[4:20:28] <@Ranryu692> oh so Devil has a Devil Trigger?

[4:20:40] <@SSaryn> That isn't the Gunlancer.
[4:20:41] <ElSuperNova> VO's really hamming it up LUL
[4:20:42] <azure_dunes> "THIS CLASS IS GUYS"
[4:20:42] <majindusto> BERSERK
[4:20:42] <+Jack8274> No There is a LEGIT gunlancer
[4:20:42] <42nfl19> ok no wonder this has controller support
[4:20:42] <%rumtumtugnutz> Path of Edgelord
[4:20:42] <joodatious> is this gonna be like black desert where it has "action combat" but the game is boring
[4:20:50] <Saltmeisterr> Cool
[4:20:51] <comicalmond> in this Behemoth typhoon
[4:20:51] <%Broand> Oh this is Dungeon and fighters only in ARPG view
[4:20:53] <%nichos7> VA's having fun
[4:20:55] <%DovaDude29> Idk about this one bud
[4:20:58] <%Djinnazz> This looks like every mobile ad ever.
[4:20:59] <%nichos7> Which I respect
[4:21:02] <@SSaryn> THAT'S THE GUNLANCER.
[4:21:05] <%Noir_Valdr> "hur dur this is cringe" man shut the hell up
[4:21:06] <akitanito> literal gunlancer
[4:21:09] <%rumtumtugnutz> Path of Extra!
[4:21:10] <%RigmaroleHM> ORIGINAL
[4:21:10] <%Noir_Valdr> it looks cool
[4:21:11] <joodatious> god this is painful to look at
[4:21:13] <42nfl19> Is this Raid Shadow Legends?
[4:21:13] <SomeStrangeBroad> looks like a phone game
[4:21:14] <%DianaTheAscian> THEY CAN DO THAT???
[4:21:15] <@SSaryn> And it's legit a really good class.
[4:21:24] <joodatious> the blinking lights is awful
[4:21:27] <$PinkertonDanPie> that's what I've been saying dude. it's legitimately the monster hunter gunlance
[4:21:27] <+TheMeromex> compression shitting itself
[4:21:32] <%JoshManVGH> Fuck it, MonHunt deserves to be aped from
[4:21:37] <%DovaDude29> This game looks, way too extra
[4:21:39] <%Valdorick> Damn, SSaryn called out
[4:21:40] <ExpressNode> You'll be crying like an anime fan on prom night!
[4:21:41] <DXLelouch24> @PatStaresAt and guess what? INFINITE FREE RESPECS
[4:21:43] <DXLelouch24> GO NUTS
[4:21:46] <%Noir_Valdr> ...I might have to try the gunlancer
[4:21:56] <@SSaryn> Listen.
[4:21:58] <%Agami23> was that an LB3?
[4:21:59] <%RayReborne> fucking Spirit bimb
[4:21:59] <+xilmarinenx> GENKIDAMA
[4:21:59] <%za7az> He got the food LUL
[4:22:01] <+Jack8274> Yeah free respec all the time is great
[4:22:03] <LordGeneric> My only question is how long does it take to get to content where things are tough enough to make you pay attention. I feel Diablo games always are way too easy at the beginning and take a long time to ramp up
[4:22:03] <@SSaryn> And yeah Soulfist is just Goku.
[4:22:05] <%lightbringrrrr> I'm seeing a lot of graphics but nothing looks appealing
[4:22:05] <jumpyhugs> fuckin spirit bomb?@
[4:22:07] <+A0N33> Alright Spirit Bomb nice
[4:22:08] <+seaearthandsky> literal spirit bomb
[4:22:11] <person181> contentS? why not just content
[4:22:12] <ElPlasa> @JoshManVGH I am honestly surprised more games haven't blatantly ripped off MH
[4:22:13] <%JoshManVGH> Soulfist seems lit
[4:22:14] <+ZephynM> I am getting some Diablo flashbacks.
[4:22:33] <akitanito> ded
[4:22:33] <Saltmeisterr> did you say CHAOS?
[4:22:34] <+Jack8274> All these systems are like 12+ hours in
[4:22:35] <%lazysaiyajin> thanks Pat
[4:22:36] <joodatious> this is Dawn of War 3 levels of overblown graphic effects

[4:33:47] <%kyh9> @kyh9 I know Korean films and literature and even TV have fantastic writing.  But the biggest issue is Korea has not had a significant single-player game scene.  So there's never been any draw for good Korean writers to go into games
[4:33:49] <+the22cstomp> this looks like gpose
[4:33:51] <%LorcaNomad> I've met people who've literally gotten married meeting in MMOs

[4:36:02] <+ReallyBigRocks> NotLikeThis please stop saying it
[4:36:03] <SomeStrangeBroad> mmo motherfuckas
[4:36:06] <TheyCallMeVawn> I dont wanna
[4:36:08] <GarbageNirvana> I mean if they could make this a good Diablo-like that could be good enough
[4:36:10] <%AncelDeLambert> this game ironing out the bugs for two years before I get to it does make me feel better about trying it
[4:36:13] <DancesWitBalrog> that's cool ngl
[4:36:13] <%kyh9> Well, here's hoping it's good
[4:36:14] <%kyh9> Is it good
[4:36:15] <neraren> The scale isenormous
[4:36:15] <Play_UN_Squadron> i dont play MMO, but its really funny seeing all these 14 fanboys getting panties in a knot over it
[4:36:16] <+rafaelba93> ark-asia?
[4:36:16] <+TopTieramisu> did they really just go "you tried the best, now try the rest?"
[4:36:16] <%Transatlantic_Dylan> I dunno about y’all but I’m absolutely not sold
[4:36:19] <@SSaryn> Like, the Director for this game has also been actually super genuine with his answers in interviews he's done too. It's kinda nuts. Taking a tip out of Yoshi-Ps book it feels.
[4:36:19] <%Bluwizard21> @PatStaresAt If they literally did not have him talk at all and just showed the footage I'd appreciate it more
[4:36:21] <%AncelDeLambert> we shall try it

[4:36:25] <%AKW4RD_BUFF4LO> Watched Maven play it earlier this evening, looks like Diablo
[4:36:29] <+Jiggisnipe> WoW has been the biggest for years in MMOs, FF14 is relatively recent boon in popularity
[4:36:31] <%LorcaNomad> just straight up an animus tho like what
[4:36:32] <%rumtumtugnutz> So is Goldfinger the Tom from Myspace of this game?
