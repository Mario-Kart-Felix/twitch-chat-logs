[0:02:56] <%XeroSigmaPrime> HALFLIFE 3 EXISTS
[0:02:57] <%starotter70> BibleThump I can't believe Pat killed Woolie
[0:02:58] <%Soulbishop> Woolie did not reach his roads built quota
[0:03:04] <%skizzuto> apatDab apatDab apatDab
[0:03:10] <%Soulbishop> So we had to take him out
[0:03:13] <redwilt> Can't believe Pat shot Woolie's audio setup
[0:03:20] <Nina96> woolie didnt pay for protection
[0:03:24] <chalkchug> jermaPluto BibleThump Pat sabotaged Woolie jermaPluto BibleThump
[0:03:31] <%Soulbishop> He was taken of the network
[0:03:39] <+Double_Tap_That> !uptime
[0:03:40] <%Soulbishop> He will need a new cupid to reconnect
[0:03:41] <@Moobot> I've been playing this game for how long? Oh only 3m 42s.
[0:03:47] <IndoorSitup> Anyone else see that AWFUL review of Death Stranding by videogamedunkey?
[0:03:51] <@lewdskeletor13> Pat killed Woolies stream, there can only be one
[0:03:56] <%Animorphimagi> why now? luckily I have time to watch but why the weird time?
[0:04:04] <BigManLugan> Is this the power of the red bar warrior
[0:04:09] <%Soulbishop> So question that I feel we all overlooked
[0:04:09] <redrins> smth smth sleep schedule
[0:04:11] <@lewdskeletor13> @animorphimagi Cause pats sleep schedule is fucked
[0:04:15] <%starotter70> apatGib As a certain cat willed it
[0:04:18] <chalkchug> He sneaked through the keyhole and slammed a sledgehammer on Woolie's pc BibleThump jermaPluto
[0:04:25] <%megabrogus> @IndoorSitup one of only a few yt vids Ive ever hit dislike on
[0:04:26] <%Order_of_Mystery> who else excited for HLVR?
[0:04:29] <redwilt> why can't pat unfuck it
[0:04:29] <%Animorphimagi> yay
[0:04:35] <@lewdskeletor13> Looks pretty neat
[0:04:38] <%This_is_Marco> the level of vitriol DS gets is weird, its like it went into their homes and robbed them
[0:04:47] <%Soulbishop> If the timefall makes you older. . . whats to say Sam isnt a kid in age and just got time fell into an adult body?
[0:04:57] <%TheAsianAvenger96> who's ready for more ghosts and cum
[0:05:00] <%Soulbishop> We still don't know what dooms is and what the different levels do?
[0:05:00] <ThatOneGuyYouSaw> last time I was this early something something something
[0:05:12] <UnfilteredComic> what chapter is pat on
[0:05:19] <Nina96> 4?
[0:05:23] <@lewdskeletor13> 5
[0:05:24] <IndoorSitup> @megabrogus Shame because I like dunkey but watching his review was the most obtuse shit ever.
[0:05:28] <@lewdskeletor13> I think?
[0:05:34] <zenith0111> cantaHehe
[0:05:37] <seanchai2025> We starting in?
[0:05:49] <%Soulbishop> I think he said 5 on the podcast
[0:05:50] <Meta_Four> Timefall is only skin-deep though. So if it aged you up, you'd be a kid's brain in an adult body.
[0:05:53] <redwilt> but did you know DS is Mario. HAHAHA funni funni
[0:06:04] <tomdwarf> @This_is_Marco I mean, I can understand some of it, given that it's central gameplay loop is REALLY divisive. Its closer to Euro Truck Simulator than a stealth/action game. Managing bars, equipment, and getting from A to B being the central focus.
[0:06:05] <%Soulbishop> You dont think he acts childish?
[0:06:11] <zenith0111> It'sa me.... Sam Kappa
[0:06:23] <ThatOneGuyYouSaw> MARIO
[0:06:25] <ThatOneGuyYouSaw> AND
[0:06:27] <IndoorSitup> Dunkey straight up tried to drive a motorcycle up a steep rocky mountain, like wtf else did he think would happen?
[0:06:27] <ThatOneGuyYouSaw> PRINCESS
[0:06:32] <%JuliusGemstone> pat. did your goblins eat woolies stream?
[0:06:39] <%Soulbishop> Maybe we are mistaking childish angst for loner vibes
[0:06:40] <redwilt> dere's no jumping! DIS CAN'T BE MAYREO
[0:06:41] <UnfilteredComic> BEACH
[0:06:44] <%anticrust> Did Pat die after starting the stream, but before actually coming on camera?
[0:06:46] <zenith0111> Hey but that's what you expect from Dunkey Xd
[0:06:53] <%starotter70> apatGoblin
[0:07:00] <Cherokia666> Can't wait for more Death Stranding with it's MONSTER ENERGY DRINK with Norman Reedus from AMC'S "RIDE" WITH NORMAN REEDUS
[0:07:06] <redwilt> but it wasn't funny
[0:07:09] <%Soulbishop> I would run away from my mom being president too if I suddenly (rugrats voice) got all growed up
[0:07:09] <zenith0111> Upper Echelon tried to fault the game for having "MAGA Hats" Smh
[0:07:15] <redwilt> and that's the worst part
[0:07:25] <tomdwarf> Yeah, Dunkey tends to go for "what silly shit can I do in the game" before anything. But yeah, he's into quick, right in your face games. Death Stranding is NOT that.
[0:07:27] <%mield916> apatGoblin apatGoblin apatGoblin
[0:07:29] <%This_is_Marco> @tomdwarf the gameplay loop is fine, I mean the story can be confusing since its presented slowly. But rather than be curious with what the game is, most people write it off and trash it
[0:07:30] <Cherokia666> A red had made him mad?
[0:07:40] <tylerpyre> skelmo lookin kinda thicc ngl
[0:07:41] <chalkchug> HE'S HERE
[0:07:41] <Meta_Four> Haha, we all thought DS was based on Stalker. It's actually just a sci-fi adaptation of BIG
[0:07:43] <%Kiiper> YEYEYEYEYE

[0:08:11] <seycheles> big early patters!
[0:08:12] <tomdwarf> @This_is_Marco to be fair on the other side again, the story is told pretty poorly. With points reiterated over and over, and stilted dialogue.
[0:08:13] <%mield916> it might be kojima not liking Trump that set of ue
[0:08:13] <%This_is_Marco> @tomdwarf Im like 90% done. I think the game is ok. Not mind blowing but I just dont understand the hate
[0:08:13] <zenith0111> @cherokia666 Yep said it was clearly a "Trump reference" even tho the base color of the hat isn't red
[0:08:15] <%cureneckbeard> nyannHi

[0:08:55] <tomdwarf> @This_is_Marco I can understand the hate, but it's definitely not a 1/5 or 2/10, worst game EVAR. At worst, its like a 3/5. Its 4/5 for me.
[0:08:58] <PkSilent01> You’re early

[0:16:36] <Picosunloaded> Cock juice
[0:16:36] <worldbrand> try kraeting daeng if you can get your hands on it, it's the drink red bull was based on
[0:16:38] <IndoorSitup> DRINK WATER PLEASE
[0:16:39] <%marsanta> Do they get Relentless in Canada?
[0:16:40] <%aishman> Hey Pat. Did you ever try to get Xrd on PC? I was thinking of doing the same thing since Woolie's hype has got me super interested in Guilty Gear
[0:16:41] <%Rachet122> Rachet122 subscribed at Tier 1. They've subscribed for 10 months! woo 10 months, time to watch walking with norman reedus and his funky fetus
[0:16:43] <flatty1000> so in this world is Monster being produced in a factory?
[0:16:45] <chalkchug> he just faked all of this and put red bull in all of them
[0:16:46] <+Walopoh> Did pat watch the HL trailer?
[0:16:47] <kirketorp> still PRETTY bad
[0:16:49] <flatty1000> where are they getting the ingrediants for it?
[0:16:50] <%starotter70> YEAH!?
[0:16:51] <%Meow0369> Pat the sugar isn't what makes them bad it's the death juice
[0:16:52] <%SWFanatic> fuck up your GI flora
[0:16:53] <Frozenflame01> @AngriestplPat what is your thoughts on Woolies let's play of death stranding so far?
[0:16:57] <Ocaz> robitussin energy drink
[0:16:58] <Kongro_> What does it have instead of sugar then? Poison?
[0:16:59] <%Laecerelius> They're only 95% as bad for you as regular Monster
[0:17:01] <%cureneckbeard> I'll give you $5 to drink a full can original green flavour in one like norman reedus
[0:17:02] <%BallerSwagBro9k> Theory: Pat hacked Woolies stream to get all his viewers @AngriestPat
[0:17:05] <hot4dukat> what is this 4 PM strem?? lol
[0:17:07] <reonome> redbull isn't going to be happy about this
[0:17:07] <%FrostMass22> @cherokia666 The road from the distribution center to mountain knot is a must, getting to the city with no road sucked

[0:17:22] <%mield916> I don't think pat watched woolies lp
[0:17:25] <%starotter70> Drinking purple, man this is replacing Woolie's stream @AngriestPat
[0:17:28] <reonome> his stream died LUL
[0:17:29] <%honeyman18> I haven't had anything but coffee, tea, and water for 3 years so if I drank a soda my heart would explode.
[0:17:30] <mayorrev> Woolie had to cancel BibleThump
[0:17:30] <%FrostMass22> Pat needs to play his construction game
[0:17:30] <kirketorp> grapefruit flavored drinks never taste of anything but purple
[0:17:32] <UnfilteredComic> Kappa
[0:17:33] <%lotharrio> But it turned out that Woolie couldn't figure it out.
[0:17:34] <%Laecerelius> Woolie's stream died, though.
[0:17:37] <rosemon5001> the zero sugar ones are literally worse for your health
[0:17:37] <PunishedRaccoon> @AngriestPat his stream broke
[0:17:38] <flatty1000> so if norman drinks Monster do the MULES drink Red Bull
[0:17:38] <%linSP> MMM CHEMICALS
[0:17:42] <flatty1000> or something viler

[0:20:19] <chalkchug> Pat talk like a redneck or ELSE
[0:20:30] <%CappuccinoGuil> Motion Blur should be off by default.

[0:21:02] <%marsanta> I'd like to see Woolie play it but Pat doesn't need to be there
[0:21:07] <WUFFLEBEAM_PRIME> is any Woolie LP likely?
[0:21:07] <%Niney_Who> Little bit Woolie'd

[0:21:10] <%SWFanatic> Pockets 2 Return of the Pockets
[0:21:12] <%vaporousTippler> Pockets is already in Fallen Order, so no need for KotOR 2.
[0:21:12] <%FrostMass22> Playing RPGs with Woolie, I'm amazed you didn't kill yourself
[0:21:14] <+DRAGKUDO> It would also fuck up Woolie's schedule
[0:21:15] <chalkchug> D:

[0:21:26] <+robert_edwards> Woolie plays games like old people fuck.
[0:21:26] <%lotharrio> What if Pat plays, and Woolie just stands behind him and convinces him to do space crimes?
[0:21:31] <arkv01> ALL THESE VOICES INSIDE MY HEADDDdd

[0:22:56] <Louie_Salmon> Sure man he's crazy
[0:22:56] <redwilt> but it's his friend
[0:22:56] <%Aeogard> its kojima
[0:22:58] <%Laecerelius> That sounds like something they'd do
[0:22:59] <%tweedler92> Its on like season 3
[0:23:02] <zeif00> There's an episode where Norman and Dave Chappelle go clam digging
[0:23:03] <Louie_Salmon> Kojima IS CRAZY
[0:23:05] <OldManDeckardCain> monster energy is also fake Kappa
[0:23:05] <$oAlec687> It's Kojima
[0:23:07] <Mastigias> I thought it was a fake ad until the podcast happened
[0:23:09] <+BillyWimblett> shoutout to AMC surviving past the death stranding
[0:23:09] <%thegreenbenis> Hey pat how is that flavor of monster? @AngriestPat
[0:23:11] <flatty1000> does death stranding norman look at the poster and go "huh this guy looks a lot like me"
[0:23:13] <zenith0111> WTF
[0:23:26] <%honeyman18> it should have been fake, only to announce it was airing after the games release.
[0:23:26] <%Fenrirlives> does this mean Sam Porter Bridges is one of those celebrity look alikes in the Death Stranding universe?
[0:23:27] <%theAncopro> I'm Mario and your AMC's Ride with Norman Reddus
[0:23:28] <%SlimeSlimeSlime> Purple, almost as good as Blue.
[0:23:28] <Habblewater> It could be the best thing in the world but if you get bombarded with ads for it kills any desire to watch it
[0:23:31] <mayorrev> @AngriestPat There's a bike skin that has RIDE on its side
[0:23:33] <%BallerSwagBro9k> Red Bull defeated
[0:23:34] <@commanderclaw> So it tastes like love?
[0:23:37] <%SvenHolgersson> I won't lie I thought Ride was a fake show made for Death Stranding
[0:23:37] <chalkchug> that better be water inside that can
[0:23:37] <%Fenrirlives> THE CHEMICAL BURGER
[0:23:41] <%Aeogard> even in your brain?

[0:27:13] <KaiserMario> On NG?
[0:27:14] <blackesteagle> it was 12 min for TOW last I checked :P
[0:27:14] <+BringBackSempai> thats some pro cutscene skipping
[0:27:14] <%Doomcoder> Ziplines may be the ideal form of transportation, but the satisfaction of building a road is unparalleled. It's some Manifest Destiny shit
[0:27:16] <ThatOneGuyYouSaw> speedruns will get faster as more and more roads are made
[0:27:22] <worldbrand> I wonder how they handle that mission with the super fragile package
[0:27:23] <zenith0111> 4 hours unoptimized
[0:27:24] <$Yakobro> 0
[0:27:25] <%SvenHolgersson> Every year
[0:27:26] <zipfile777> @AngriestPat one streamer finished game in 86 hours total
[0:27:26] <%SlimeSlimeSlime> Don't forget, pee on dangerghosts before they getchya!
[0:27:28] <%Animorphimagi> naw ziplines
[0:27:30] <captainshtbox> what episode are we in?
[0:27:33] <%SvenHolgersson> Fucking every. Fucking. Time
[0:27:35] <arkv01> current world record is stll faster than a FF7 speedrun
[0:27:45] <worldbrand> Yes, that's important
[0:27:47] <%Meow0369> I only found that out after I beat the game
[0:27:47] <Hydrapissed> Combo bullet
[0:27:48] <zenith0111> YES
[0:27:48] <flatty1000> so when do you get cum bombs
[0:27:48] <%Doomcoder> new combat tech
[0:27:48] <%Deadpal> those tooltips
[0:27:49] <Isord> yezh
[0:27:49] <Demon_chann> you didnt knew?
[0:27:51] <%Deadpal> are so important.
[0:27:52] <captainshtbox> shoot it throught the vape cloud and you do MASSIVE DAMAGE
[0:27:54] <+D00msDayDan> do blood combo
[0:27:55] <+BringBackSempai> yeah if the nade doesn't kill it in one
[0:27:56] <%GeneralSCPatton> I assume speedruns have to be offline to avoid seeding them with prebuilt infrastructure
[0:27:56] <Kongro_> do combo
[0:27:56] <shiny_prinny> new tech
[0:27:58] <%honeyman18> Boss Strats
[0:27:59] <$Yakobro> G U N
[0:28:01] <+griffball13> yeah when you shoot the blood gets on it
[0:28:01] <%Fenrirlives> Yeah you get a ton of more hits in the same window of time @AngriestPat
[0:28:02] <Demon_chann> G U N
[0:28:02] <Louie_Salmon> Do combo?
[0:28:03] <%BallerSwagBro9k> I lost a PC to Windows update
[0:28:05] <Isord> MAYBE YOU SHOULD READ YOUR TIPS THEN
[0:28:06] <deadlnmiami> still only on episode 5 lole
[0:28:06] <+BringBackSempai> BT pistol is still the best
[0:28:08] <%CappuccinoGuil> Has Pat learned about the OP power of peeing on BTs?
[0:28:09] <+BringBackSempai> one shots most of them
[0:28:10] <%SWFanatic> shoot the glahssss
[0:28:14] <Kongro_> do combo for big number
[0:28:15] <zenith0111> @angriestpat The strongest combo is the Custom Hematic Grenades and Gun
[0:28:19] <worldbrand> It gives lethal weapons an actual purpose, because the non-lethal ones have hematic rounds too
[0:28:20] <%Doomcoder> Blood Katas
[0:28:29] <%Fenrirlives> You Mean Fuckface?
[0:28:30] <+apocplz> i've seen some people unintentionally glitch through past sections of the game, so that's probably how they get the speedrun down so fast
[0:28:32] <ELuscious> yall eat ass? CiGrip
[0:28:33] <%SWFanatic> spec blood mage
[0:28:36] <%joylent_blue> are loading screen tips the new instruction manuals

[0:28:57] <+griffball13> @AngriestPat the trophy that takes the longest on ps4 is getting everthing 5 stars

[0:30:03] <%Aeogard> LUL wheres the luck here
[0:30:04] <ThatOneGuyYouSaw> fulton a rank 5 mule
[0:30:05] <blackesteagle> cos power skeleton loved you long time
[0:30:08] <%marsanta> You should get someone to 5 star to see what happens
[0:30:09] <+purps26> start at lake knot and make your way down
[0:30:12] <%Animorphimagi> star
[0:30:15] <%shootbang_exe> @AngriestPat some npcs give really good shit at level 4 or 5
[0:30:15] <+D00msDayDan> a few preppers have rank 5 rewards, and there's also guys like craftsman that have repeatable reward items
[0:30:16] <@commanderclaw> What does 5 star do?
[0:30:19] <zenith0111> @angriestpat You can see how many likes you get from doing the request @angriestpat
[0:30:20] <+Evitron1> it depends on the npc
[0:30:20] <%SlimeSlimeSlime> French Canadian Hologram Critic.
[0:30:21] <%GeneralSCPatton> @AngriestPat Some places give GOOD SHIT for 4 or 5 stars. TRUST ME

[0:30:48] <%BallerSwagBro9k> Thats right Morty
[0:30:49] <akita_opal> You need the level 10 Butt Skeleton. The Ass must go further beyond!
[0:30:49] <%joylent_blue> your time to backseat
[0:30:50] <+Evitron1> besides at 5 stars you get a star for your pants, and arent star pants the best reward of all?
[0:30:55] <%honeyman18> Mostly just lvl3 guns and legs
[0:30:55] <%joylent_blue> do not squander it
[0:30:56] <KaiserMario> @AngriestPat BIG TIP: Get the truck and pile on deliveries in a line, deliver some in one location and then get more there, I got like 12 on a single go
[0:30:57] <%JD_Lars> JD_Lars subscribed at Tier 1. They've subscribed for 12 months, currently on a 11 month streak! Gotta min/max to fight the goblins. Just keep crunching those numbers, Pat.
[0:30:58] <%theAncopro> doesn't it boost how many structures you can build in an area too?
[0:30:59] <+einherjarvalk> if you have Timefall Porter in your room drink 4 of them and then start doing things
[0:31:03] <%linSP> i got defensive vehicle for 5 star
[0:31:03] <KnightAsteran> always get at least rank 4 for the good shit, rank 5 is pretty much always a sticker
[0:31:06] <%Doomcoder> that's what DMC Nico drives
[0:31:09] <%shootbang_exe> @AngriestPat you'll wanna level up collector for mind goblin purposes
[0:31:09] <%BallerSwagBro9k> defense go up
[0:31:10] <VritraReiRei> @commanderclaw puts a Star on his pants. so if you do then=m all you'll have like 20+ stars covering your legs

[0:31:29] <+D00msDayDan> level junk boy for speed skeleton
[0:31:33] <%kyuubisonic> doesnt the junk guy give the speed skeleton

[0:59:18] <ShmowzowKapow> chiral matter bro
[0:59:18] <$HyperionXV> Oh I got the schedule off by an hour.
[0:59:19] <%Meow0369> Don't worry
[0:59:19] <SnaKemuho> this game says that we need to preserve THE NATURE, but then tells you to dump shit into a lake DansGame
[0:59:19] <%theAncopro> Who's tossin trash on MY frontyard
[0:59:20] <waifoong98> BT will remember that Kappa
[0:59:21] <+BringBackSempai> Junk's Haunted

[0:59:27] <%ace_cfa44> I hope those are used car batteries
[0:59:29] <%honeyman18> Time to Fight the Tar Lake GOD
[0:59:30] <Kaffeebohnson> wtf that ddnt happen to me
[0:59:31] <DocMadfox> So I saw people complaining about Death Stranding reviews not telling you if the game's good or no, and I'm just watching Pat deliver semen and throwing trash into a tar lake going "Yeah I'll buy that on PC"
[0:59:31] <%Divryne> BTs HATE littering.
[0:59:32] <%Typhaeon> That lake was an old Indian burial ground
[0:59:32] <VritraReiRei> why not just recycle it, you get a miniscule amount of materials but better than nothing like doing ti this way
[0:59:33] <%BallerSwagBro9k> THE ANTI LITTER GODS COME FOR YOUUR SOUL
[0:59:34] <raminnoodle420> Ghosts would like you stop being wasteful
[0:59:34] <savvypanda> I love this game (maybe because it can be oddly relaxing), but never has Pat’s term of “Stares at” sums up me playing Death Stranding perfectly
[0:59:35] <kazadog> GO BACK FROM WHENCE YOU CAME
[0:59:40] <+BringBackSempai> you can throw lefty also
[0:59:41] <$HyperionXV> Hello chat. maxyyH

[0:59:43] <%GeneralSCPatton> @snakemuho It's a fucking tar hole. Earth doesn't care.
[0:59:46] <%cureneckbeard> apatBig littering
[0:59:48] <%Laecerelius> Pat loves this game since it's all about littering
[0:59:51] <%SvenHolgersson> THIS IS WHY GOD STRADED US PAT
[0:59:52] <$Hommando> Litter for twitter likes
[0:59:54] <%Typhaeon> "From whence" is redundant
[0:59:57] <%Doomcoder> Why are they just floating there? Shouldn't the lake eat them?
[0:59:57] <dukenux> oh it's a tar lake
[0:59:58] <%Meow0369> they'll just respawn
[1:00:02] <%Typhaeon> Whence means from
[1:00:02] <%derap41> Pollution solved for ever
[1:00:05] <alextrebeken> he found a way to litter in a game
[1:00:06] <fist_wizard_jay> FUCK THE GHOSTS LITTER MORE
[1:00:08] <$Yakobro> 👍
[1:00:10] <dukenux> yeah those were made for dumping garbage in them, werent they?
[1:00:14] <%theAncopro> can you piss during timefall
[1:00:15] <kazadog> @Typhaeon its a joke from arrested development
[1:00:16] <flatty1000> truck looks busted as fuck

[1:00:25] <%Alpha8087> Now go muddin
[1:00:29] <%lotharrio> Based old school polluter.
[1:00:29] <%Meow0369> to be far the tar in this game does connect to some weird demon realm
[1:00:30] <mikash91> 1960s eco tech
[1:00:32] <fist_wizard_jay> DUMP THE TRUCK IN THE LAKE
[1:00:33] <%LiquidShake83> do it
[1:00:36] <$Yakobro> @AngriestPat when if you go in the lake
[1:00:37] <CelioHogane> Throw the radiation on the lakes, i bet never would go wrong!
[1:00:44] <%This_is_Marco> Just throw the pollution away 4Head
[1:00:45] <%Meow0369> So you're basically littering into some demon realm
[1:00:49] <+RAAAAAINMAKER> Honestly if I had a bottomless tar pit, I'd never use a bin
[1:00:52] <%Doomcoder> when I look at this barren, haunted wasteland, you know what I see? a perfect society
[1:00:56] <KaiserMario> @AngriestPat Instead of pressing square for each item on a list, you can just hold button and press down
[1:00:57] <+robert_edwards> the real mindfuck in this game is when you start getting Likes from BTs.
[1:01:02] <Habblewater> FUCK OFF GHOST
[1:01:18] <dukenux> @Meow0369 wasnt tht something the corp from DOOM did? Just throw the trash into the portal to hell?

[1:01:38] <%Meow0369> why ram
[1:01:40] <NotHereToStream> you can only get up to level 2 anti bt gun pat, so once you get that, forget her

[1:05:44] <%Meow0369> @KaiserMario I only saw one received there, I swear when I played it was one per single or multiple if done at once
[1:05:46] <CanadianAnimatorGuy> She can give you new boots if you send her another delivery
[1:05:51] <dukenux> as long as you manage to keep soil nutritious
[1:05:56] <mayorrev> ohhh ok
[1:05:57] <KaiserMario> @Meow0369 he got 2 just now
[1:05:58] <zenith0111> Collecor gives an amazing upgrade for the backpack

[1:15:02] <%Floorislava> @AngriestPat charging the grenade fills it with more blood and does way more damage

[1:15:05] <%AncelDeLambert> Do like Dunkey, Pat, walk up the wall
[1:15:06] <NeonBleu> Are BBs actually robots or something?
[1:15:06] <%Doomcoder> feed Monster Energy to your BB
[1:15:12] <KaiserMario> @AngriestPat Pat, could you inform Woolie of pressing triangle to auto-sort?
[1:15:16] <kazadog> poor turok shadowman

[1:15:35] <thetruthofyourbeing> OF COURSE NOT!
[1:15:36] <+timbob> Does dying actually put a huge crater in the map?
[1:15:36] <%derap41> Woolie doesn't know about power pants
[1:15:37] <%marsanta> Woolie doesn't know is a good catch all
[1:15:39] <astroPunkFunk> how embarrassing
[1:15:40] <%Divryne> WOOLIE IS BLINDER THAN YOU PAT.
[1:15:41] <%ArcanumMBD> Woolie probably knows by now. But in ep3 he was manually placing gear. Haven't seent latest eps yet
[1:15:42] <waifoong98> you mean Woolie can't read? Shocking Kappa
[1:15:42] <HyperBomb21> Woolie cant read
[1:15:45] <KaiserMario> THATS WHAT I KEPP SAYING
[1:15:45] <%Animorphimagi> WOOLIE IS SOOO BAD
[1:15:46] <%Doomcoder> Woolie Has Not Figured It Out Yet
[1:15:47] <%jcenderion> WOOLIE CANT READ LUL
[1:15:49] <deviate_dv8> BB is submerged in MONSTER
[1:15:50] <+solzan2000> well to be fair there is a lot of shit on the UI
[1:15:51] <+robert_edwards> he can't see text in game
[1:15:53] <KaiserMario> ITS ON THE SCREEN
[1:15:55] <+Loyks> he cant read
[1:15:56] <%GarbageNirvana> I bet he doesn't know about timed hits either
[1:15:56] <astroPunkFunk> BE FAST
[1:16:01] <%Floorislava> my one beef with this game is that the roads have tentacles
[1:16:01] <%Meow0369> Hold the triggers when going down a hill you big dumbo
[1:16:05] <%ArcanumMBD> I think Woolie just needs glasses. Or a bigger TV
[1:16:07] <+Punisher7771> wait is pat atthe grand canyon?
[1:16:08] <mayorrev> wheeeeeee
[1:16:09] <zenith0111> NO WAY
[1:16:09] <+RAAAAAINMAKER> Dangerous games we play
[1:16:09] <GeneGrim> I think the game should auto sort by default. Why would you never wanted not doing it
[1:16:10] <ianabstract> use the carrier
[1:16:12] <%Alpha8087> Pat sreak, speeds by
[1:16:16] <%Doomcoder> most downloaded PC mod will be text size increase
[1:16:20] <%GeneralSCPatton> @AngriestPat The man doesn't think it's his responsibility to get within reading range.

[1:16:26] <kazadog> Sonic the hEDGEHOG (2020)
[1:16:27] <astroPunkFunk> this might give me a heart attack
[1:16:28] <%ArcanumMBD> like not even joking. Him having issues reading prompts in Death Stranding is a legit "maybe his eyesight is bad" concern
[1:16:32] <%LiquidShake83> press square
[1:16:35] <mayorrev> pat how come you're not using your carrier as much
[1:16:36] <%derap41> They don't have a UI scaling option?! what is this 2005
[1:16:36] <Divum_muviD> you don't want to autosort when carrying a pizz

[1:17:01] <zenith0111> @doomcoder I thought about that and they would have to just make it certain text and not all text because even though it's super small it can fill the entire screen at times.

[1:27:30] <%Meow0369> Pat you don't even hold enough grenades to ever use the 8 blood bags of blood you'd have
[1:27:31] <%SvenHolgersson> @SlimeSlimeSlime A man of culture i see
[1:27:33] <Krisaeron> Sam IS basically a warframe, a really shitty one
[1:27:34] <%derap41> That pouch couldn't hold shit like that
[1:27:34] <+GeneGrim> interesting you build from top to bottom
[1:27:37] <Kaffeebohnson> yo can ROTATE?!?
[1:27:39] <%joylent_blue> now this is attache case HD
[1:27:42] <%StrifeZubia> More pouches than the Marvel Universe
[1:27:48] <KaiserMario> @AngriestPat you don't have the better grenade pouch yet? 3 for the price of 2
[1:27:53] <+D00msDayDan> is that utility pouch just for blood bags?
[1:27:55] <+RAAAAAINMAKER> Not Perfct
[1:27:57] <+Loyks> It's not really
[1:27:57] <%derap41> Flip the battery
[1:27:57] <waifoong98> 1 slot open tho Kappa
[1:27:58] <Kongro_> Thats so dumb looking
[1:27:58] <%SlimeSlimeSlime> @SvenHolgersson I could very well say the same about you.

[1:28:03] <deviate_dv8> Do you have the golden hat too?
[1:28:05] <%aishman> There's ONE corner that doesn't get used
[1:28:07] <KaiserMario> AH shame...
[1:28:07] <Kaffeebohnson> Aren't you bothered by that one unused square?
[1:28:08] <sirrice77> @AngriestPat cosplayer gives you better grenade pouch
[1:28:09] <%Doomcoder> is it even possible to fill up that corner
[1:28:10] <+RAAAAAINMAKER> Its fine
[1:28:11] <%BallerSwagBro9k> RE4 storage LUL
[1:28:11] <%GeneralSCPatton> SOON
[1:28:12] <thetruthofyourbeing> Brown
[1:28:12] <%Meow0369> And you never use the grenades anyway
[1:28:13] <Fujiwara_92> Flip the battery
[1:28:20] <%This_is_Marco> @Meow0369 jesus christ this backseating..
[1:28:21] <%Meow0369> You need to carry max grenades now
[1:28:22] <+BringBackSempai> nah its fine
[1:28:26] <+machshop> it doesn't matter
[1:28:26] <%derap41> Are you trying to piss of chat with that placement
[1:28:28] <%ArcanumMBD> that layout is aesthetically unappealing
[1:28:30] <zenith0111> @kaffeebohnson The handle of the battery occupies the spot
[1:28:30] <%crimsonharvest> the handle is on top so it seems fine
[1:28:38] <%Meow0369> @This_is_Marco It's a stream, pat is an adult he can ignore me if he likes
[1:28:42] <+BringBackSempai> he meant flip it sideways
[1:28:42] <%trashcansan> 3
[1:28:43] <%Laecerelius> could things fit better if it was sideways?
[1:28:46] <+BringBackSempai> but its fine
[1:28:48] <%dekkitout> Remember Pat, plus side up for batteries
[1:28:51] <%Alpha8087> Can doing the battery sideways work better
[1:28:55] <+VideoGameTim_> GOT EM
[1:28:55] <Kaffeebohnson> Put the free space in the middle for maxium balance
[1:28:56] <%Doomcoder> you got to flip it turnways
[1:28:56] <$Yakobro> no ignore me
[1:28:57] <+Promessa_EX> he noticed you
[1:28:58] <%Meow0369> Exactly
[1:28:58] <Krisaeron> Dont do it Pat!
[1:28:58] <+RAAAAAINMAKER> Pointing at the baby
[1:28:58] <%This_is_Marco> please do
[1:29:02] <rumuloh> I guess Pat hates RE4

[1:29:08] <%derap41> Now wo have to suffer that backpack layout for hours
[1:29:11] <+RAAAAAINMAKER> Tap the glass
[1:29:11] <%linSP> i turn my battery on its side
[1:29:12] <thetruthofyourbeing> Revive your feetus reetus
[1:29:20] <Fujiwara_92> You can fit stuff better with the battery sideways
[1:29:22] <%Bane_Kaikyo> @AngriestPat Why didn't you put 3 gren pouches all in a row on the right under the blooooood pouch? they you did it makes MY OCD freak out
[1:29:24] <ianabstract> Going from 7 grenades 4 blood bags to 3 grenades 5 blood bags seems like a bad trade
[1:29:24] <%Alpha8087> PRODUCT PLACEMENT
[1:29:30] <%Laecerelius> Red hat?
[1:29:34] <%SvenHolgersson> DONT SKIP THE PRODUCT
[1:29:35] <%trashcansan> sam only drinks monster and eats bugs
[1:29:36] <+RAAAAAINMAKER> Golden Hat
[1:29:37] <%joylent_blue> i mean, i want it be, because he was annoying me
[1:29:38] <+BringBackSempai> you always have that one spot left over
[1:29:39] <+StealthNeku> Putting the battery sideways actually let me fit better things
[1:29:39] <+mcjimbo12> wait it's ACTUALLY just monster? i didn't know
[1:29:41] <%derap41> He looks so sad wearing that hat
[1:29:47] <waifoong98> next to the backpack
[1:29:48] <+RAAAAAINMAKER> You can customise gear above the backpack
[1:29:49] <%theAncopro> look at the equipent window glass
[1:29:49] <%Bane_Kaikyo> nvm I guess
[1:29:49] <%derap41> same place as the backpack
[1:29:50] <%GarbageNirvana> Change color scheme on suit

[1:30:05] <%SvenHolgersson> GOLDDDDDDD
[1:30:06] <%Meow0369> @ianabstract For some reason people seem to think that 8 blood bags for only a few grenades makes sense go figure

[1:35:15] <%dekkitout> Is there a shotgun that shoots the cummies
[1:35:18] <%Meow0369> You even get a noob tube at some point
[1:35:23] <KaiserMario> @AngriestPat Isn't the fact that every item is expendable makes these unique ones much more tolerable?

[1:35:36] <zenith0111> @punisher7771 I thought the same thing. It's pretty clunky looking for a hand gun LUL
[1:35:37] <%StrifeZubia> @dekkitout I definitely saw a 'sticky gun' so probably
[1:35:39] <thetruthofyourbeing> BTs eat the cummies yum yum

[1:44:04] <%AncelDeLambert> ... gonna zip or naw?
[1:44:17] <%joylent_blue> GeneralSCPatton you had the balls to try and that's what counts
[1:44:18] <%AncelDeLambert> ziiiiiiip
[1:44:18] <+D00msDayDan> you probably should have built the ziplines before taking this order
[1:44:20] <mayorrev> ZIP
[1:44:27] <mayorrev> we ZIPPIN
[1:44:28] <+RAAAAAINMAKER> Take the bike
[1:44:29] <NotHereToStream> also mules beware
[1:44:36] <%dickbuttwoman> Grab that bike
[1:44:37] <Daxalog> So are zips just cheaper bridges that cant take vehicles?
[1:44:40] <%Soulbishop> Should have put it higher on the mountain
[1:44:41] <ScreamLord> The Zipping System is a go!
[1:44:46] <CelioHogane> @Daxalog yes
[1:44:47] <%GeneralSCPatton> Cheer500 Check out the southern tip of that landmass if you want to see something weird.
[1:44:55] <+Punisher7771> WHY NOT TAKE THE BIKE?
[1:45:01] <+Kurvera> use da bike
[1:45:02] <+RAAAAAINMAKER> You foolYou asshole take the bike
[1:45:02] <+Reizie_Etherealm> He can't?
[1:45:05] <%trashcansan> bikes are for cowards
[1:45:16] <%AncelDeLambert> this trailblazing mechanic is not one I thought I needed but I want it now
[1:45:16] <%joylent_blue> its too late now gotta commit
[1:45:26] <%Soulbishop> Pat wants that S rank. . . the S is for struggle
[1:45:28] <arkv01> I wish norman would ride me like one of his french bikes....
[1:45:51] <%TheMilhouseExperience> Does he have a power skeleton or a speed skeleton?
[1:45:54] <%Doomcoder> the porn spinoff, AMC's Riding Norman's Peenus
[1:45:56] <CelioHogane> power
[1:45:57] <+Punisher7771> wait was he in the titanic?
[1:46:00] <%joylent_blue> p o w e r
[1:46:00] <superd4v3> @AngriestPat Can Zip-Lines not be used by other players?
[1:46:11] <%TheMilhouseExperience> Okay cool
[1:46:15] <DarkSurplex> How's the delivery?
[1:46:20] <+RAAAAAINMAKER> The remaining time goes to your time rating, which is the hardest stat to farm
[1:46:27] <+madeleine334> clempsHappy
[1:46:30] <%dekkitout> Right at the tip, babe....
[1:46:31] <%Soulbishop> Well wait
[1:46:40] <KaiserMario> @AngriestPat I connected this entire southern area, so I can make any delivery from the South Knot to the Central Distro in under 5 min
[1:46:45] <+LtSergei> problem is other players don't necessarily get all your zip line stations
[1:46:47] <jacknerik> You can increase a zipline's range with upgrades, right?
[1:46:49] <%Alpha8087> @TheMilhouseExperience Not gonna lie I read that as Close Range or Long Range skeleton
[1:47:00] <%AncelDeLambert> surprised the game doesn't have some kind of chiral batman line climbing thing
[1:47:02] <%Soulbishop> wont only other players with ziplines already unlocked be the only ones who can see them?
[1:47:07] <%joylent_blue> jacknerik yeh
[1:47:16] <zenith0111> The East side of the map is the least beneficial for Zip Lines because it's the only side with Roads
[1:47:21] <+Punisher7771> oh the wheat people
[1:47:22] <jacknerik> Do both ends need to be upgraded for them to connect?
[1:47:23] <%Meow0369> I connected the entire main road via ziplines at one point
[1:47:31] <%Nobrev> @soulbishop only if they have the spoiler block on iirc
[1:47:32] <%marvel877> will you have enough bandwidth for all those ziplines, Pat?
[1:47:33] <xiidrifty> There's much worse
[1:47:36] <%joylent_blue> Soulbishop i think only if they have the spoiler setting turned on
[1:47:37] <Ted_the_red> but the east side isn't the only one with roads
[1:47:38] <zenith0111> Save the bandwidth for the mountains and west side
[1:47:40] <%AncelDeLambert> FOOD GLORIOUS FOOD
[1:47:40] <ScreamLord> Ziplines sound like they can solve every problem ever for Porters
[1:47:46] <KaiserMario> @AngriestPat I mean to EVERY delivery point in the southern region
[1:47:46] <%TheMilhouseExperience> @alpha8087 wait until the “vertical” skeleton. It’s useful later.

[1:48:01] <%gespenst25> Thanks Jeff Bridges.
[1:48:14] <%Soulbishop> Thank you Nash Bridges
[1:48:15] <startstoprepeat> ziplines can't really do big deliveries or chilled deliveries so they're not perfect for everything
[1:48:16] <KaiserMario> @AngriestPat Some hours, and like 20-ish of those

[1:52:04] <%jcenderion> monkaS OH OOOF OUCH HIS SPINE
[1:52:04] <%Divryne> @AngriestPat Be careful ziplines eat up a ton of bandwidth if you aren't careful.

[1:52:10] <zenith0111> Depends how much Bandwidth you have
[1:52:10] <thetruthofyourbeing> 99

[1:52:16] <+Weeewer> Check your bandwidth
[1:52:16] <+machshop> depends on line of sight and all that
[1:52:18] <%Niney_Who> Do you have enough bandwith?
[1:52:18] <Manwad> Remember, you can upgrade the ziplines for moe range
[1:52:19] <+robert_edwards> greeed
[1:52:19] <%arsonistdaria> does a bullet work with a slingshot pat

[1:52:24] <+RootVeggie> Check the distance between destinations
[1:52:27] <Ted_the_red> yeah you're gonna want more ziplines for later area's that are way more of a pain in the ass
[1:52:27] <Booveman> Hey Pat, really enjoyed your stream of Star Wars Jedi: Fallen Order, any chance you will stream more of it? @angriestpat
[1:52:29] <+HeyBoston> lmfao
[1:52:29] <%Soulbishop> You ever notice pat wont just go out and build he has to multitask
[1:52:31] <%conradical> zipline back to South Knot then take a trike or truck
[1:52:33] <+machshop> store gold ladders
[1:52:34] <%linSP> also ladder or two for climbing
[1:52:34] <%Alpha8087> Jenga Reedus over here
[1:52:38] <zenith0111> I covered the entire map in Ziplines. But I could only do that since I basically maxed out all social links
[1:52:45] <%valriot> Store the ladders?
[1:52:45] <%jcenderion> YOUR GONNA CARRY THAT WEIGHT
[1:52:47] <%Soulbishop> This would go way faster if he just did the zips first and came back.
[1:52:47] <jimmytwofeet> EVERGREEN CONTENT
[1:52:53] <+machshop> if you build them you can zip back and grab more
[1:52:56] <KaiserMario> @AngriestPat OH yeah, pay attention to your bandwidth, I ran into that problem when connecting the world with zip-lines

[1:59:35] <+Punisher7771> wait shouldnt that fuck up your arm pat?
[1:59:39] <%Soulbishop> can you make a zip nexus?
[1:59:40] <ThatOneGuyYouSaw> @AngriestPat are ya winnin, son?
[1:59:41] <+NitronStreams> Reedus' arms are fuckin buff
[1:59:44] <%Meow0369> @G_Thunders On hard mode they can 100 percent nab you on the zipline, not mid zip but floating choosing your location or landing they can
[1:59:47] <%AncelDeLambert> holy fuck. I mean, this won't work for big deliveries, but for speedy runs across the map this is dope
[1:59:48] <startstoprepeat> @AngriestPat if you go into first person, you can mark your next location from your previous one. shows distance too.
[1:59:48] <%trashcansan> it's the dooms
[1:59:48] <arkv01> can we just replace public transport systems with huge ziplines
[1:59:49] <%xtremegamer80> @G_Thunders Take out your penis to piss on them on the way
[1:59:51] <%Doomcoder> @Reizie_Etherealm there was actually a quest to connect them to a timefall prediction thing, before that they were screwed
[1:59:55] <%trashcansan> dooms makes you buff
[1:59:57] <+RAAAAAINMAKER> Shouldn't carry all that on your spine, crush you?
[1:59:58] <NotHereToStream> monster energy does this to you

[2:00:06] <%BallerSwagBro9k> THE REED
[2:00:06] <blaggablag> SO LAST NIGHT I was setting up one of these and someone put one in a way where it let you down in a literal 20meter fall in mountain knot city
[2:00:08] <%Jack_of_No_Trades> That stuff is stacked at least 4 pats high
[2:00:09] <+Reizie_Etherealm> @Doomcoder Thank you, I missed that part
[2:00:11] <+DesertPenguin> @ANgriestPat just wait til you get to the snowy area. Some guy build a Ski Resort with ladders and you slide down on your supply thing
[2:00:12] <%valriot> Reedus will Deletus
[2:00:12] <%TheMilhouseExperience> It’s fine his wrist is holding him and all the packages
[2:00:14] <arkv01> the reedus gives no peedus
[2:00:14] <zenith0111> Sam actually gets bruises on his wrists if you do this a lot :)
[2:00:16] <%AncelDeLambert> roads too expensive?
[2:00:20] <+HeyBoston> logistics!
[2:00:20] <%Meow0369> Pat you haven't seen anything yet that snowy mountain bullshit is the worst to walk
[2:00:23] <%AncelDeLambert> cuz eventually you'll need trucks to go through
[2:00:24] <%valriot> Get used to that LUL LUL
[2:00:27] <%Floorislava> yeah, its for the mountains
[2:00:28] <Darkrenai> You think its fucked now LUL
[2:00:33] <%AncelDeLambert> also, the robots need roads
[2:00:36] <bashful_bard> A zipline network to the farm is fairly essential
[2:00:37] <%Keyd00d> You think THIS is bad
[2:00:37] <jacknerik> @AncelDeLambert There are no roads you can build in those areas
[2:00:44] <KaiserMario> @AngriestPat The craziest thing in this game is Sam climbing a rope only with his hands carrying 300+Kgs
[2:00:45] <+RAAAAAINMAKER> Roads are useful for those 1,000 kg delivers from station to station
[2:00:56] <%TheMilhouseExperience> Zip lines are super useful later
[2:01:06] <%joylent_blue> damn
[2:01:06] <%trashcansan> it's the dooms
[2:01:08] <%chiluzza> one full american
[2:01:08] <zenith0111> I'm playing Offline so I have no roads rmzSLAIN
[2:01:10] <%trashcansan> he's just buff
[2:01:14] <%cureneckbeard> 661 pounds
[2:01:15] <Big_Dream> sam is super man
[2:01:15] <Elsewize> He's B U F F
[2:01:16] <Hydrapissed> sam = robot confirmed
[2:01:19] <ThatOneGuyYouSaw> REEDUS STRANG
[2:01:21] <Kongro_> One small american
[2:01:22] <%AncelDeLambert> Yeah, Sam should have some kind of Batman gas ascension thing
[2:01:23] <blaggablag> It's a shame you can't use it for the big hauls. Those god damn 500Kg missions are either truck your way around or get ready to haul carts for an hour
[2:01:25] <sphereshots12> Robot legs
[2:01:26] <%Meow0369> iirc that kind of weight on your body actually crushes your spine, like it's lethal
[2:01:30] <%Meow0369> Delete it after
[2:01:31] <%Meow0369> No wait
[2:01:33] <bigobama> We americans can all do that.
[2:01:35] <arkv01> hey do NOT DISRESPECT MR BRIDGES
[2:01:35] <Manwad> Chiral cells, son
[2:01:36] <%valriot> This game is just Kojima pointing at Normans huge dick
[2:01:36] <bashful_bard> But the cargo's so balanced
[2:01:37] <%AncelDeLambert> #MakeSamBatman
[2:01:37] <%cureneckbeard> 315kg is 694 lbs
[2:01:37] <%TheMilhouseExperience> It’s because Sam IS AMERICA!
[2:01:40] <+FDRsLegs3345> is it true the point of this game is to walk around and deliver pizza and cum?
[2:01:42] <+LtSergei> you don't have space for that unless you upgrade it
[2:01:43] <+BringBackSempai> ctrl alt del you
[2:01:48] <%Laecerelius> he has the power of AMERICA on his side
[2:01:49] <superd4v3> @FDRsLegs3345 Yes
[2:01:55] <zenith0111> @blaggablag You can also deliver it chunks at a time using the ziplines
[2:01:58] <+Punisher7771> its 683.4 pounds at most
[2:02:04] <%linkster291> Same carries the most important thing of all. The American Dream.
[2:02:04] <+RAAAAAINMAKER> Zipline is the new girl in your life now
[2:02:05] <ianabstract> can you place it so thatit reaches the one at the farm
[2:02:07] <ThatOneGuyYouSaw> when doe she unlock the apache helicopter?
[2:02:12] <%Meow0369> there is fine
[2:02:17] <%Meow0369> it's finnne
[2:02:19] <thetruthofyourbeing> look at his little feets
[2:02:20] <seycheles> hahahaha I just got a redbull ad soon as I get back to pat
[2:02:22] <%cureneckbeard> just put another one
[2:02:22] <%AncelDeLambert> maybe the peak to the left?
[2:02:25] <KaiserMario> For those wondering, thats almost 1/3 of a metric ton
[2:02:26] <%AncelDeLambert> ah well
[2:02:37] <%StrifeZubia> How in the hell did you not eat shit there
[2:02:39] <thetruthofyourbeing> HIS FUCKING KNEES!
[2:02:42] <bashful_bard> Just gotta setup a midpoint
[2:02:42] <%AncelDeLambert> isn't a metric ton in kilograms anyways?
[2:02:43] <%rytisone> work faster
[2:02:51] <%cureneckbeard> 315kg is about 1.5 Pats
[2:02:52] <CelioHogane> @AncelDeLambert yes
[2:02:54] <+Kriptin> Oh god, I thought someone was joking when they said the roads are replaced by Ziplines.
[2:02:55] <blaggablag> m a g i c l e g s
[2:02:56] <%joylent_blue> y'all need to get on pat's level
[2:02:59] <+Reizie_Etherealm> Try it
[2:03:02] <+Punisher7771> this game better end with sam having a fucking hernia
[2:03:02] <%trashcansan> oooo smart
[2:03:03] <KaiserMario> @AncelDeLambert A ton is 1000 Kg
[2:03:03] <%SlimeSlimeSlime> Friendship with road over, zipline is bestfriend now.
[2:03:13] <%Soulbishop> Now you are thinking with ziplines
[2:03:15] <arkv01> the last thing you hear norman say is "How do you want to die, on your back or on my back?"
[2:03:20] <+Reizie_Etherealm> Maybe that'll connect back to the farm too
[2:03:22] <%Nobrev> sam should have been rent in twain by that fall
[2:03:28] <%AncelDeLambert> A ton is 2000 pounds, a METRIC ton is one Megagram
[2:03:35] <waifoong98> Nice
[2:03:35] <%Razputin217> Reedus has stronger legs than Outer Worlds protag
[2:03:37] <blaggablag> Someone somewhere is writing a guide of optimal zipline placement for this map
[2:03:38] <+starzo0> nice
[2:03:40] <bashful_bard> Ziplines are fairly limited so roads are preferable where they're available
[2:03:40] <alwayspronking> perfect
[2:03:40] <%Explodincatz> gg
[2:03:41] <%joylent_blue> beautiful
[2:03:41] <%Laecerelius> WHOOOO!!

[2:03:45] <%GeneralSCPatton> NAISU
[2:03:46] <+Reizie_Etherealm> Zipline porn
[2:03:48] <%Soulbishop> You connected to 3 out of 4
[2:03:50] <%trashcansan> apatDab
[2:03:52] <%Niney_Who> Is it bypassing one of your prior ones?
[2:03:53] <Rich_In_Antioxidants> Is Pat gonna finish playing Fallen Order? That seemed like a really enjoyable stream
[2:03:53] <zenith0111> If you use roads too much you might not get the crystals you need or cryptobiotes
[2:03:56] <%dickbuttwoman> Now delete the other one
[2:03:57] <ArtoriasTheTrenchfighter> Now you can dismantle to free u bandwidth
[2:03:58] <KaiserMario> @AncelDeLambert That is more accurate, yes
[2:03:58] <ThatOneGuyYouSaw> why are these americans use commie units?
[2:04:02] <%Soulbishop> So you can delete one?
[2:04:03] <%Niney_Who> @AngriestPat You just invalidated that last one too
[2:04:03] <%SlimeSlimeSlime> That IS pretty damn cool.
[2:04:04] <%neodeltai> Careful dismounting zip-lines. You can fall to your death is you face the wrong way.
[2:04:07] <+Reizie_Etherealm> I think it's safe to dismantle the other one now
[2:04:08] <%StrifeZubia> This is the dumbest and best
[2:04:11] <%BallerSwagBro9k> @Reizie_Etherealm WE ARE ENTERING LEVELS OF FETISH NEVER BEFORE SEEN
[2:04:12] <xxafrodragonxx> Gondor!!

[2:04:33] <+FDRsLegs3345> why does everything look so goofy in this game?
[2:04:35] <%jcenderion> SOMEBODY UPGRADED IT LUL
[2:04:38] <%Meow0369> upgrade just makes other players have an icon requesting an upgrade
[2:04:42] <blaggablag> You know, people are giving this game a hard time for being dull as an action adventure but I'm slowly realising it's actually a really good third person Transport Tycoon
[2:04:42] <+starzo0> poor guy wasted his mats
[2:04:50] <ThatOneGuyYouSaw> wah wah waaaaaah
[2:04:56] <+Reizie_Etherealm> @BallerSwagBro9k Never before seen fetish for ziplines, I never thought I'd see the day LUL
[2:04:57] <%Meow0369> It wasn't actually being upgraded, just marked for other players are requesting an upgrade
[2:04:59] <All_Salt> If this map is the majority of America, then really, Reedus is being propelled across the country at hundreds of miles per hour on his one arm.
[2:05:01] <+DesertPenguin> Oh yea it's like a Sim City but in a different scale
[2:05:02] <%cureneckbeard> MercyWing1 apatDab MercyWing2
[2:05:03] <%AncelDeLambert> this game is the Lewis and Clarke Expedition simulator we all didn't know we wanted

[2:06:32] <awalr> this is some big rigs shit
[2:06:32] <%bevyrage> what about with a ladder?
[2:06:34] <blaggablag> @joylent_blue if you play it as this slow, relaxing campaign of setting up optimized interconection in an asynchronous multiplayer setting, it's super engrossing
[2:06:35] <ThatOneGuyYouSaw> are we there yet?
[2:06:37] <+Reizie_Etherealm> If anyone likes Frontier's Planet Coaster and Planet Zoo games, you should also check out their new Planet Zipline as well
[2:06:38] <+RAAAAAINMAKER> scan the area, there is a memory chip on that giant tower
[2:06:41] <%TheMilhouseExperience> Scan to verify if inclined are climbable.
[2:06:42] <%Soulbishop> Put a zip on the bridge
[2:06:46] <Hoanui> aw yeah trials evolution in 3d
[2:06:47] <%Floorislava> @AngriestPat i feel that you should be pinging all the time looking for memory chips
[2:06:48] <%jcenderion> POINTLESS BRIDGE YEYEYE
[2:06:48] <%Meow0369> wall
[2:06:55] <%Ner234> LUL
[2:06:56] <%StrifeZubia> See how he mocked the bridge to nowhere? Saved valuable battery life
[2:06:57] <+FDRsLegs3345> why is it like this?
[2:06:58] <%Ner234> PERFECT
[2:06:58] <%Meow0369> and hit the wall
[2:06:59] <%AncelDeLambert> LUL
[2:07:11] <%joylent_blue> blaggablag totally agree, even just watching it i find to be really engaging in a weird way

[2:07:12] <%Nobrev> jesus you could use your package tower as a jousting lance if you wanted to @angriestpat

[2:07:52] <+DesertPenguin> That's how this works
[2:07:53] <%valriot> @angriestpat But Pat, this games just a boring walking simulators Kappa
[2:07:54] <%Divryne> You build that zipline or I'm unsubbing nerd.
[2:07:54] <%Meow0369> I'm here to backseat you into doing the bad things
[2:07:55] <Manwad> Yeah! Logistics!
[2:07:56] <Mister_McDerp> logistics are AWESOME
[2:07:57] <%dekkitout> I wanna see you "build" a three stage rocket
[2:07:57] <Rich_In_Antioxidants> this is why people like minecraft

[2:08:07] <+RAAAAAINMAKER> Honestly it's like watching the first strokes on a masterpiece that will be Pat's Zipline web of madness
[2:08:09] <Demon_chann> i mean i was playing digimon with this on the background jut wating for the story
[2:08:09] <Picia000123> It's a well built game, just not with a mass market appeal
[2:08:09] <dukenux> We truly are Death Stranding
[2:08:11] <%Jack_of_No_Trades> Honestly, these are the kind of games i love the most, after so many years, getting to see you play one is a pleasure
[2:08:14] <blaggablag> I'm at this point where plot happens and I'm like BUT MY ZIPLINES THO
[2:08:15] <%BallerSwagBro9k> DEATH CRAFTING
[2:08:16] <%joylent_blue> septimbean nah he's still in chapter 5
[2:08:16] <jacknerik> <3 Its awesome to see someone play this that knows what they are doing <3
[2:08:17] <%GeneralSCPatton> @soulbishop No one can agree if materials respawn, and nigh infinite is not enough for the MIND GOBOLINS
[2:08:18] <ArtoriasTheTrenchfighter> Seeing you complete these roads and build these shortcuts is incredibly satisfying
[2:08:20] <CelioHogane> @septimbean not even close
[2:08:20] <kazadog> @AngriestPat these death stranding streams are some of the most fun Ive had on your stream
[2:08:20] <+Reizie_Etherealm> KEEP ON KEEPING ON BROTHER
[2:08:23] <+RootVeggie> Death Stranding is a comfy game
[2:08:23] <Picia000123> Like, every design decision works here

[2:08:25] <%Kiiper> MOAR ZIPLINES
[2:08:27] <%rumtumtugnutz> this game has the potential to be a 'do dumb shit' simulator
[2:08:30] <septimbean> @joylent_blue thanks for telling (:
[2:08:30] <jouzuyumi> Build a Spaceship
[2:08:33] <%trashcansan> maybe the death stranding is the ziplines we made along the way
[2:08:33] <%This_is_Marco> later he'll never even touch the ground
[2:08:39] <%joylent_blue> np :D
[2:08:42] <%TheMilhouseExperience> Wait did pat get to chapter 4 yet?
[2:08:43] <%Floorislava> saw the new ps5 controller doesn't have that dumbass light bar on it thank god

[2:08:55] <waifoong98> @TheMilhouseExperience he is in 5 right now
[2:08:59] <+LtSergei> i set up zip lines between junk dealer, chiral artist and the film director

[2:09:09] <worldbrand> In case you need the bandwidth later, you can delete them via the map with triangle
[2:09:11] <zenith0111> @floorislava Thank fuck. That things default setting was so bright!
[2:09:11] <ScreamLord> That sneeze sounded painful
[2:09:12] <bashful_bard> It's shortcut porn except you control how good tge shortcuts get
[2:09:12] <%SomeSageAdvice> bless you
[2:09:14] <%BallerSwagBro9k> gesunheight

[2:09:18] <jimmytwofeet> DEY CALL ME BALUGABAA
[2:09:19] <blaggablag> @LtSergei OH that's a BRILLIANT ONE
[2:09:28] <+Reizie_Etherealm> Infrastrucure simulator: the game: the movie: the series
[2:09:30] <blaggablag> although... you can truck that route pretty easy
[2:09:32] <%Meow0369> remember to do story later pat
[2:09:36] <%Laecerelius> ZIP LIIIIIIIIIINES!! The new road!
[2:09:44] <+RootVeggie> But you'll be helping out other people
[2:09:50] <+valkuma> @AngriestPat Outerheaven built a really sick Zipline network im curious to see if it shows up for you
[2:09:53] <awalr> chiral redbars
[2:09:54] <%BallerSwagBro9k> PAT NO. OTHER PEOPLE
[2:10:00] <%CarcerDun> Zipline across America
[2:10:00] <HyperBomb21> @AngriestPat NO DONT DELETE I NEED THEM
[2:10:02] <blaggablag> ZIP LINES tm: It's like ghostless roads!
[2:10:02] <%joylent_blue> the gold clashing with the purple and green really ties it all together
[2:10:06] <%Rumbutt> Leave them to farm tru3Thumb
[2:10:09] <%Meow0369> deleting items from the world doesn't delete them from other peoples games
[2:10:11] <aeonicvector> cant you seed specific freinds worlds together?
[2:10:12] <%Doomcoder> apparently ghosts can haunt the ziplines
[2:10:15] <%tweedler92> Oh a woolie bike
[2:10:17] <Picosunloaded> Other people pat
[2:10:19] <jacknerik> There is a generator right there pat
[2:10:19] <%BallerSwagBro9k> You dick LUL
[2:10:21] <%trashcansan> lol
[2:10:23] <%TheMilhouseExperience> 5 starring places gets you more bandwidth.
[2:10:23] <+LtSergei> deleting things doesn't remove them from other people's worlds, once they already have them
[2:10:25] <%Meow0369> If you delete your items it doesn't delete them from other peoples worlds
[2:10:27] <+RAAAAAINMAKER> No, fuck 'em, Ziplines are essential for the Mountain area if you want to boost those connections
[2:10:29] <%Soulbishop> You hear that erection?
[2:10:30] <mikesapartment> do not build ziplines on roads
[2:10:33] <%SlimeSlimeSlime> Out of range
[2:10:43] <KaiserMario> @AngriestPat About Amelie, her name is "Sam-antha Amerie-ka Strando", Get it? the japanese sure love their puns...
[2:10:50] <zenith0111> Ziplines on the road Kappa
[2:10:51] <%J_Papa> How many total likes you got?
[2:11:00] <+Reizie_Etherealm> You could argue that by enabling easy access from the start, there'll be no satisfying gameplay for other people when they come through right?
[2:11:04] <shadytreeofknowledge> u ever just wanna punch somebody
[2:11:05] <%BallerSwagBro9k> @Meow0369 It does. Wheu delete an item it specicakky says it removes it for other people as well
[2:11:07] <%J_Papa> 140k looks like
[2:11:07] <%Doomcoder> oh my god. Amelie, Amerie-ka. I'm so mad
[2:11:07] <+RAAAAAINMAKER> 140,000 likes for Pat
[2:11:10] <Guardiansaiyan> !uptime
[2:11:11] <@Moobot> I've been playing this game for how long? Oh only 2h 11m.
[2:11:11] <coracor> Is that a Unit-01 bike?
[2:11:15] <Guardiansaiyan> so late
[2:11:17] <%joylent_blue> KaiserMario shut UP i hate that
[2:11:17] <shadytreeofknowledge> sup Pat
[2:11:17] <seycheles> pat stranding
[2:11:26] <ThatOneGuyYouSaw> can't wait for pc mustards to travialize the game days after release
[2:11:26] <blaggablag> WAIT SO they were called Sam and Samantha?
[2:11:27] <%cureneckbeard> gotta go fast
[2:11:28] <%Meow0369> @BallerSwagBro9k No, it doesn't, I know for a fact it doesn't. It stops it spawning in new worlds, but keeps it in those that have it already
[2:11:29] <Claxter_> why did pat just ignore the generator
[2:11:29] <bashful_bard> Other people never see all structures someone builds
[2:11:31] <aeonicvector> @Reizie_Etherealm They dont enable until your caught up, theres spoilerproofing
[2:11:31] <%chaumiester> Ooh, early stream. What's the special occasion?
[2:11:39] <%Typhaeon> Old man sleep schedule
[2:11:41] <dukenux> Oh you dont care huh?
[2:11:41] <%Meow0369> @BallerSwagBro9k I know for a FACT it doesn't remove it from other peoples worlds that already have it
[2:11:43] <%Soulbishop> Apparently spoiler free mode blocks them from seeing constructions like that until they unlock them themselves
[2:11:46] <%joylent_blue> i'm so mad about Amerie-ka
[2:11:49] <%Laecerelius> It to true to reality, guys
[2:11:49] <Guardiansaiyan> We can belive it

[2:12:24] <+LtSergei> i feel like there's supposed to be reason that characters have so many individual names, like a commentary on something. But I have no idea what it is
[2:12:24] <%Doomcoder> is there anywhere in the world that actually looks like this
[2:12:24] <bashful_bard> oof
[2:12:31] <%Soulbishop> you need 2 to bridge that gap
[2:12:32] <+Reizie_Etherealm> @aeonicvector So unlocks are tied to side quest progression as well, good to know

[2:12:55] <%ArcanumMBD> Place and upgrade? It'll boost to 500m range if you upgrade
[2:12:57] <HyperBomb21> I heard Shenmue 3 is actually pretty good

[2:19:20] <blaggablag> Do ladders take bandwidth?
[2:19:22] <%J_Papa> You need some all-gold cargo

[2:20:04] <+BringBackSempai> I like how absolutely sure people are who have never played the game
[2:20:06] <Frostydough1> This just like Zipline with Norman Reedus on AMC!!
[2:20:10] <%joylent_blue> StrifeZubia at the very least the person opening it will have a bad time
[2:20:12] <%J_Papa> Got enough bandwidth? 500 per zipline

[2:21:08] <+BringBackSempai> ziplines are worth the bandwidth
[2:21:12] <IntrepidDolphin> you were going to take a big delivery from where you are to south knot city

[2:21:50] <+BringBackSempai> 500 network for a 300m zipline vs 1000 network for a 80m bridge
[2:21:51] <worldbrand> no deal only zipline
[2:21:52] <%joylent_blue> Calek chapter 5
[2:21:52] <corpsegoo> I didn't get around to doing my ziplines until after my roads were done, much regret
[2:21:53] <ianabstract> gonna deliver that 2300kg delivery?

[2:21:53] <+Reizie_Etherealm> Speaking of story, where did you left off?

[2:22:07] <CelioHogane> No deal, just do ziplines
[2:22:08] <Calek> @joylent_blue thanks babe
[2:22:13] <%xtremegamer80> So what're the downsides of bot delivery and is it easy to fix?
[2:22:18] <KaiserMario> @AngriestPat LUL I just realized you're doing the same thing I did, just fill the map with lines and completely ignoring the story for hours!
[2:22:21] <%Doomcoder> [Heartman voice] No one knows exactly where Monster Energy comes from, but the implications of its existence are FASCinating.
[2:22:23] <Kaffeebohnson> holy shit does he have a finished highway??
[2:22:23] <+BringBackSempai> no gods, no masters, only Zipline
[2:22:29] <+zombibyte_> left off at Mama
[2:22:31] <%linSP> you should make a zipline for the tutorial area
[2:22:34] <red_blaster> Ziplines are broken
[2:22:35] <thetruthofyourbeing> HES CRAZY
[2:22:35] <%Meow0369> collector pat
[2:22:40] <%TheMilhouseExperience> Do you want more cool things to use. Story is essential
[2:22:41] <+BringBackSempai> he hasn't done the east west one yet
[2:22:42] <dukenux> wth is that white garbage?
[2:22:44] <%Meow0369> Collector for cargo covers
[2:22:48] <dukenux> was it ice?
[2:22:49] <Demon_chann> keep on keeping on
[2:22:52] <%joylent_blue> xtremegamer80 sometimes the cargo gets super fucked from what i've seen
[2:22:54] <%J_Papa> @Doomcoder that totally could've been a thing
[2:23:02] <%theAncopro> but nothing shows up until you unlock it, so newbies couldnt use them
[2:23:08] <corpsegoo> bots get fucked during the delivery way easier than you do and even with roads the delivery will get pretty banged up
[2:23:08] <+DesertPenguin> Why is it so hazy and flat? What part of America did this used to be?
[2:23:10] <worldbrand> bot delivery does tons of cargo damage unless you have roads leading between areas, basically
[2:23:12] <%BallerSwagBro9k> Fuck Roads
[2:23:16] <+machshop> ghosts get so mad when they see you zipline
[2:23:18] <KingVantq> !uptime

[2:23:22] <Kaffeebohnson> get out of here, zombie goasts
[2:23:22] <+BringBackSempai> this town, is feeling like a ghost town
[2:23:23] <%shootbang_exe> yeah dude you should max out the collector for timefall covers
[2:23:26] <dukenux> Ghosts cant catch you on a zipline
[2:23:31] <%rytisone> zipline kick ghosts
[2:23:39] <%vectorless_peon> im making a zipline from the tutorial area right now. well to the inceinirator in capital postgame
[2:23:44] <%J_Papa> Yep
[2:23:45] <KaiserMario> @AngriestPat Put the Zip-line on the cliff ABOVE the cosplayer, trust me, it gives you more options for later
[2:23:45] <+DesertPenguin> what
[2:23:47] <akita_opal> this tooooooown!
[2:23:53] <%Doomcoder> It's a shame we missed the opportunity to zipline with the chiral artist
[2:23:53] <%shootbang_exe> also it may be a good idea to save some bandwidth for the mountain region
[2:23:54] <Tisaric> yup
[2:23:59] <+ClaudeMcGarren> @machshop "ghosts really hate it when you do this, click the article to find out more"
[2:24:02] <+RAAAAAINMAKER> It's like watching his Mind Goblins evolve
[2:24:03] <%shootbang_exe> time for math
[2:24:03] <Kongro_> You can just use the compass
[2:24:04] <red_blaster> How long do Ziplines last until timefall destroy it?
[2:24:05] <Kaffeebohnson> er ma gerd
[2:24:05] <thetruthofyourbeing> Obsessed
[2:24:06] <%Explodincatz> u mean you were winging it?
[2:24:06] <Tisaric> It's a pain dealing with heights though
[2:24:06] <%Divryne> You can also aim first person to see. @AngriestPat
[2:24:08] <Ted_the_red> that's directly from your location though
[2:24:09] <%This_is_Marco> oh damn I never noticed that
[2:24:10] <%ArcanumMBD> Does it consider elevation though
[2:24:12] <KaiserMario> @AngriestPat It tells you how far away they are FROM YOU, not each other
[2:24:12] <%Soulbishop> You just earned your pay raise back
[2:24:14] <blaggablag> are we witnessing the birth of a zipline fetish?

[2:25:06] <Daxalog> weird flex but okay
[2:25:08] <%J_Papa> It's pretty lame that killing a Catcher only gets rid of BTs for like 5 minutes so zipping through them is way better
[2:25:08] <+DesertPenguin> so many things
[2:25:17] <arkv01> why not, a siege tank is a healthy part of any nuclear family
[2:25:17] <Tisaric> Sam is the internet repairman, DoT, and the post office in one
[2:25:20] <%joylent_blue> oh no not the BAG

[2:25:25] <Tisaric> oh also the hears
[2:25:34] <+dualviper25> You havew the BIGGEST BAG
[2:25:37] <%supersugoisenpai1> I spent half my day yesterday just building ziplines between the junk collecter, chiral artist, and film director
[2:25:40] <%cureneckbeard> in before voidout
[2:25:48] <%Soulbishop> Look at those robo buns
[2:25:50] <VVerewolfJones> ...is a sentence that's never been said
[2:25:52] <KaiserMario> @AngriestPat My advice is to build zip-lines across the lake, and just ignore BT area
[2:25:54] <%BallerSwagBro9k> Remember when yellow ground was scary? LUL
[2:26:07] <CelioHogane> The Baz confirmed for Shovel Knight Showdown right now!
[2:26:16] <%Meow0369> that's what I did
[2:26:21] <KaiserMario> @AngriestPat That's right
[2:26:26] <%Meow0369> Nothing like flying over a bottomless tar lake
[2:26:28] <%BallerSwagBro9k> LIVING IN 3019
[2:26:30] <+BringBackSempai> yeah you can totally bypass the BT zone
[2:26:31] <+D00msDayDan> BTs can't grab you while you're on a zip line but they will aggro
[2:26:37] <%J_Papa> How are there no online ziplines in this area?
[2:26:44] <+BringBackSempai> lake is less than 300m across
[2:26:44] <Tisaric> Online ziplines are weird
[2:26:49] <fist_wizard_jay> YOOO
[2:26:50] <Tisaric> They don't all show up
[2:26:51] <All_Salt> Does the lake count as an obstruction?
[2:26:52] <Kaffeebohnson> bugtesting these ziplines must have been a nightmare

[2:27:11] <+G_Thunders> Yeah wait shouldn’t he be doing this after the online ziplines load in?
[2:27:13] <blaggablag> its weird you didn't find other people's ziplines on this area
[2:27:13] <%SlimeSlimeSlime> The Mon-Stars are coming.
[2:27:16] <+zombibyte_> made a zipline system connecting all the preppers in the mountain area
[2:27:20] <VVerewolfJones> Am I right in believing once you trigger BT's to grab at you, once you shake free and run, that BT zone is null for a time?
[2:27:21] <blaggablag> my game is littered
[2:27:21] <+Godjaw> How are these boxes not falling off
[2:27:24] <KaiserMario> @AngriestPat Trust me Pat, I was VERY methodical on this and it's totally worth the effort
[2:27:24] <%dekkitout> THE Baz?
[2:27:25] <Demon_chann> how would test the ziplines im curius
[2:27:28] <%Doomcoder> the product placement and celebrity references in this game are definitely over the top but I would buy ten copies of it if you had to deliver to a new area and the person there was the Baz
[2:27:30] <fist_wizard_jay> THE BAZ
[2:27:31] <thetruthofyourbeing> DELICIOUS
[2:27:32] <%supersugoisenpai1> Better drink some gamer fuel

[2:27:48] <beetbo2> Monster
[2:27:50] <Tisaric> @VVerewolfJones i think so, if not simply shaking them off you can fight the boss and clean it out
[2:27:51] <%SWFanatic> wheres elmo

[2:28:04] <%SWFanatic> i want pictures of spider elmoman
[2:28:04] <TrollKing96> @AngriestPat Might wanna spray your cargo.
[2:28:04] <+D00msDayDan> @AngriestPat you can build ziplines in bt areas and they can't touch you while you're on them
[2:28:09] <Kaffeebohnson> but... the aesthetics!
[2:28:10] <%GeneralSCPatton> @machshop Water is filtered and mixed with some energy compounds to make Monster
[2:28:10] <coracor> TIMEFALL
[2:28:11] <%TheMilhouseExperience> Your fine now
[2:28:11] <VVerewolfJones> @Tisaric - Thanks, it felt like that - I would just trigger that and shut it down real fast
[2:28:12] <+RAAAAAINMAKER> Put all your shit in a private locker while you make your Zipline Kingdom
[2:28:20] <%Soulbishop> HIGHER
[2:28:21] <Meta_Four> The canteen uses sci-fi magic to filter the rainwater into life-giving Monster Energy™
[2:28:25] <%J_Papa> Timefall ages the wine and cheese in record time
[2:28:28] <%Soulbishop> You just had it
[2:28:31] <%bigstupidjellyfish1337> i love that the canteen converts water to monster
[2:28:32] <+BringBackSempai> lol
[2:28:34] <%SWFanatic> This one simple trick, gravity hates it
[2:28:37] <+machshop> can they turn it into something other than monster
[2:28:38] <%Meow0369> There
[2:28:38] <+BringBackSempai> its the elevation

[2:29:26] <IntrepidDolphin> you can go to the shelter that was in your way and get the cargo repaired for free
[2:29:27] <%supersugoisenpai1> The ziplines are so busted. I feel like 200m would be more balanced
[2:29:30] <thetruthofyourbeing> Zonks
[2:29:34] <VVerewolfJones> The heck, the Lake is a BT?
[2:29:36] <KaiserMario> @AngriestPat You might want to upgrade that one for the RANGE
[2:29:39] <%TheMilhouseExperience> Back into the BT zone
[2:29:40] <+RAAAAAINMAKER> Pffffft Balance patch ziplines
[2:29:45] <OldManDeckardCain> pat is just training in secret to beat kizuna ai
[2:29:49] <Tisaric> Everything goes away from timefall but it takes so damn long and people repair shit anyway
[2:29:49] <+BringBackSempai> just shoot the ghosts, its faster
[2:30:01] <Claxter_> imagine if he tipped into the lake
[2:30:02] <%TheMilhouseExperience> Don’t worry they hate lakes.
[2:30:02] <%chaumiester> Is there a story reason why you can't wrap the cargo boxes in Plastic?
[2:30:06] <coracor> container damaged D:
[2:30:09] <KaiserMario> @AngriestPat Watch out for the range on these one Pat! Lake is very wide!
[2:30:14] <stgrunu> how did he damaged that
[2:30:19] <beetbo2> yes norman it scary
[2:30:21] <%StrifeZubia> Just walk through the water it's fine
[2:30:24] <%Meow0369> It's only container damage
[2:30:27] <%J_Papa> Get to that online Time Shelter
[2:30:27] <thetruthofyourbeing> plastic would be pretty op in this universe
[2:30:30] <coracor> monkaS
[2:30:31] <%Meow0369> you should be fine if you don't dawdle
[2:30:31] <superd4v3> @chaumiester It's an upgrade you get from the Collector
[2:30:39] <%J_Papa> for free repair spray
[2:30:40] <+korth367> pls protect the beer pat
[2:30:45] <%Jack_of_No_Trades> Is the beer in this game a Porter?
[2:30:45] <Psyramics> why isnt everything then
[2:30:47] <+BringBackSempai> this ghost screwed up an entire truck shipment in my game
[2:30:48] <+Darren716> Why doesnt sam just put a plastic bag over his cargo?
[2:30:48] <+Reizie_Etherealm> But not the containers
[2:30:50] <%GarbageNirvana> Looks like it's vinyl or something yeah
[2:30:52] <+BringBackSempai> the one by the lake edge
[2:30:55] <+RAAAAAINMAKER> Bola the Ghost
[2:30:57] <%Meow0369> Stop
[2:30:58] <%TheMilhouseExperience> Always carry a can of repair spray.
[2:30:58] <%Meow0369> you fool
[2:30:59] <%Soulbishop> What was the name of the gun from judge Dredd the enforcer?
[2:31:02] <ianabstract> Walk under a timefall shelter to get a free container repair
[2:31:02] <stgrunu> 3rd person aiming isnt so hot with all those boxes isnt it
[2:31:04] <thetruthofyourbeing> Kojima loves plastic confirmed
[2:31:05] <+BringBackSempai> there he is
[2:31:12] <%GeneralSCPatton> @jack_of_no_trades Yes, there's literally an email about the origin of the name.
[2:31:13] <%joylent_blue> Sam "Yolo" Bridges
[2:31:14] <coracor> I feel like giving the player tools to fight BTs was a mistake
[2:31:14] <%Meow0369> plastic confirmed saviour of the human race
[2:31:15] <+Reizie_Etherealm> Yeah, just put plastic wrappings over everything
[2:31:20] <red_blaster> Isn't the constant timefall going to fuck up these ziplines?
[2:31:22] <Kaffeebohnson> Could you make amazing whiskey by leaving the barrels out in the timefall? Or would just the barrel get old, while the contents stay young?
[2:31:22] <%Doomcoder> sam is literally the opposite of YOLO
[2:31:22] <Rich_In_Antioxidants> cant you paddle through the lake with the otter hat though?
[2:31:27] <+RAAAAAINMAKER> Holy shit, speedrun tactics
[2:31:27] <%Jack_of_No_Trades> @GeneralSCPatton Ugh. I love it
[2:31:28] <VVerewolfJones> Problem with plastics is that it's very hard to repair on large scale. You gotta pretty much make everything super modular
[2:31:29] <%SWFanatic> "Who peed in my pants?" -Pat 2019
[2:31:31] <Tisaric> chat can you bola then cut once you get the cuff upgrades?
[2:31:31] <%GarbageNirvana> Just don't trip
[2:31:31] <VVerewolfJones> You can weld new metal
[2:31:32] <%Meow0369> there's a timefall shelter nearby iirc
[2:31:33] <%chaumiester> Can you imagine how powerful you would be in this world with Flex Tape? Or Speed Tape
[2:31:33] <KaiserMario> @AngriestPat Woolie also doesn't know that BTs are only visible if standing still
[2:31:34] <VVerewolfJones> Patch new wood
[2:31:37] <+korth367> the beer BibleThump
[2:31:40] <%This_is_Marco> the noises they make NotLikeThis
[2:31:41] <VVerewolfJones> But plastic is rather permanent in it's fabrication style
[2:31:45] <%J_Papa> Pat go into the Timefall Shelter to repair a bit of cargo damage
[2:31:55] <Kaffeebohnson> I hope DS wins for sound design
[2:31:56] <+RAAAAAINMAKER> Just cancel the order
[2:32:00] <%joylent_blue> cuz now you got ziplines!
[2:32:01] <stgrunu> "it's ok"
[2:32:01] <%BallerSwagBro9k> IS IT?
[2:32:03] <+Darren716> Actually why arent the containers made with a plastic shell around them
[2:32:06] <superd4v3> ON NOES PAT
[2:32:09] <coracor> RUINED
[2:32:11] <%marvel877> Do you not have container spray?
[2:32:12] <+Reizie_Etherealm> That's true
[2:32:13] <+SkaiVibration> looool
[2:32:13] <%This_is_Marco> just dump it in the tar pit
[2:32:14] <waifoong98> ...
[2:32:17] <%joylent_blue> its fiiiiine
[2:32:20] <%TheMilhouseExperience> Relax off you need to dispose of plastic, just burn it.
[2:32:22] <coracor> pat, your containers are exploding
[2:32:23] <Kaffeebohnson> contents are still fine
[2:32:25] <%SWFanatic> You'll carry this weight space reedus
[2:32:26] <%Explodincatz> perfect
[2:32:27] <+Darren716> Like a metal base for sturdiness, and plastic shell outside
[2:32:27] <+G_Thunders> I guess he needs to progress the story more for online zips to start showing up
[2:32:27] <+VideoGameTim_> SHELTER
[2:32:27] <%Ner234> RUINED
[2:32:27] <+Kingjhon8> rip special beer
[2:32:27] <+RAAAAAINMAKER> Tiefall shelter, what a lifesaver
[2:32:28] <VVerewolfJones> The containers are mostly plastic, but Timefall degrades everything
[2:32:28] <%dickbuttwoman> THE THING!
[2:32:29] <%J_Papa> The SHELTER is FREE REPAIR SPRAY
[2:32:30] <ianabstract> Timefall shelter gives you free container repair
[2:32:33] <%dickbuttwoman> SHELTER HAS CONTAINER SPRAY
[2:32:36] <corpsegoo> go to the timefall shelter, they can spray you with repair goo
[2:32:39] <%Meow0369> drink monster when under shelter
[2:32:39] <+RAAAAAINMAKER> Yo like the shit out of that shelter
[2:32:40] <Kaffeebohnson> get under that mushroom!
[2:32:45] <%shootbang_exe> shelter = free full repair
[2:32:46] <VVerewolfJones> It's just biological materials are more suceptible
[2:32:46] <Meta_Four> Shelter is free container spray.
[2:32:50] <+RAAAAAINMAKER> Pump it with likes
[2:32:50] <%TheMilhouseExperience> Shelter is repair spray
[2:32:51] <%SWFanatic> shiiiiny
[2:32:51] <%Jack_of_No_Trades> Wasting beer. Really? EVERY box of semen, pristine, but waste beer?
[2:32:51] <mistageeza> guys c'mon plastic is bad for the environment
[2:32:53] <%This_is_Marco> ducking skills
[2:32:53] <%Meow0369> drink monster while you wait also you need to go back out and in to fully repair
[2:32:54] <+Imn0tacop> Just remember pat. No matter how bad you mess it up, at least you didn't void out
[2:32:54] <ianabstract> unf

[2:33:07] <stgrunu> OH SO IT'S TIMEFALL THE THING THAT BREAKS CONTAINERS
[2:33:08] <stgrunu> i'm dumb
[2:33:09] <All_Salt> Why didn't you put it in your private locker until you made the ziplines?
[2:33:11] <%TheGreatSkenardo> I'm actually pretty sad about that mom joke
[2:33:12] <%Meow0369> drink monster energy aning
[2:33:14] <Tisaric> I never build shelters but I'm always so grateful for the people that do
[2:33:28] <+RAAAAAINMAKER> Give Likes
[2:33:28] <+Reizie_Etherealm> Like the thing
[2:33:30] <Kaffeebohnson> how could he not have liked that shelter..?
[2:33:35] <thetruthofyourbeing> imagine if it rained monster energy
[2:33:36] <%Meow0369> energy... waning...
[2:33:38] <%joylent_blue> wow shelters are kinda OP
[2:33:40] <beetbo2> love the sounds the hoodie makes
[2:33:41] <+machshop> smash that like button
[2:33:44] <VVerewolfJones> I had a hard time justifying building things, and upgrading them
[2:33:44] <%trashcansan> liking is for cowards
[2:33:49] <%shootbang_exe> you should check if it's feasible to rest there until rain stops
[2:33:49] <%SWFanatic> you can't hug with a closed fist
[2:33:51] <beetbo2> RAINBOW!
[2:34:00] <%GarbageNirvana> Wonder if you could find a way to use timefall to age wine super fast
[2:34:10] <KaiserMario> @AngriestPat You CAN upgrade it
[2:34:17] <CelioHogane> @GarbageNirvana unlikelly
[2:34:18] <+zombibyte_> upgrade it for more range
[2:34:21] <Tisaric> Yeah upgrade makes it 350 CM
[2:34:23] <Meta_Four> There's that one farm using timefall to grow crops super fast.
[2:34:24] <Tisaric> KM*
[2:34:24] <%trashcansan> @GarbageNirvana the glass would just age
[2:34:26] <%TheMilhouseExperience> @garbagenirvana wouldn’t that dilute the wine?
[2:34:29] <%joylent_blue> i feel like aging wine with timefall would just end up watering it down
[2:34:29] <%GarbageNirvana> It'd be tricky not to water it down, yeah
[2:34:30] <stgrunu> @GarbageNirvana wouldnt it water the wine
[2:34:34] <Claxter_> They use timefall to grow crops, it might work?
[2:34:40] <%BallerSwagBro9k> @GarbageNirvana Welp you have your post deathpocalypse income all set up now LUL
[2:34:42] <+seaearthandsky> @GarbageNirvana probably not because by definition the water would dilute the wine
[2:34:44] <Tisaric> there's a timefall farm
[2:34:44] <KaiserMario> @AngriestPat I mean... with the materials, you could
[2:34:47] <Daxalog> What if we used Tastefall to turn Wine into a drink thats actually good
[2:34:47] <%Typhaeon> Pat Simulator
[2:34:51] <beetbo2> its the Crash pat
[2:35:04] <beetbo2> the crash after monster time
[2:35:04] <thetruthofyourbeing> fucking delicious monster energy
[2:35:11] <@lewdskeletor13> Don’t fall asleep on stream
[2:35:12] <+Eclipse_knight_> just make the wine stronger to compensate
[2:35:12] <%Shady_Zaku> Shady_Zaku subscribed with Twitch Prime. They've subscribed for 8 months! Ayyy! 8 fun months of staring, thanks for all the fun times again lavabeard! Here's to many more.
[2:35:15] <%BallerSwagBro9k> Upgrade range
[2:35:23] <%TheMilhouseExperience> Wow you barely have any monster.
[2:35:25] <Tisaric> the range only hits 350km
[2:35:28] <Tisaric> it's too far
[2:35:31] <+RAAAAAINMAKER> Deliver that shit already and go make your Network
[2:35:34] <KaijuVania> monster is nasty :)
[2:35:38] <Ragnakawaii> I think you need more boxes Pat, your slacking
[2:35:42] <beetbo2> still drinking monster, pat?
[2:35:43] <%J_Papa> You would have to max out the distance on both of them and move the distro center's to the other side of the road
[2:35:48] <+seaearthandsky> @GarbageNirvana though I suppose you could use it to age the grapes to that you could start the process sooner
[2:35:56] <beetbo2> or we back to old faithful red bull
[2:35:57] <Rich_In_Antioxidants> monsters great and all but Bang has double the caffeine
[2:35:58] <Claxter_> Just leave a plastic container outside with some fruit and make some bombass jungle juice
[2:36:01] <%Shady_Zaku> Agent Nomahn Jaydeeen
[2:36:04] <Tisaric> it's usually just easier to use an extra yeah
[2:36:08] <%trashcansan> it's fiiiiiine
[2:36:10] <%Typhaeon> @Rich_In_Antioxidants Plus no massive overdose of B vitamins
[2:36:10] <KaiserMario> It's fine
[2:36:12] <+machshop> the last time i had monster i felt like my gut was gonna explode
[2:36:19] <stgrunu> just build a zip line tower upside down and then build the other one on top of it
[2:36:19] <%dickbuttwoman> Why would you need to go east anyways?
[2:36:24] <%GarbageNirvana> @seaearthandsky Necessity is the mother of invention, right
[2:36:31] <beetbo2> ^
[2:36:36] <+seaearthandsky> true
[2:36:36] <fazoburquina> how long do ziplines last before timefall eats them up?
[2:36:37] <+RAAAAAINMAKER> Maybe you're too weak to drink monster

[2:36:43] <thetruthofyourbeing> theres like 80 grams of sugar in one can how is it legal??
[2:36:43] <Rich_In_Antioxidants> just dont mix energy drinks with beer or you're in for a cardiac arrest
[2:36:44] <+machshop> i must be
[2:36:44] <%Strider222> man we will never finish the story haha
[2:36:50] <+rj1771> One of my favorite things about this game is that the further along you get, the more and more you start looking like one of those junk-collecting muppets from the end of The Labyrinth.
[2:36:55] <Kaffeebohnson> nothing happens but
[2:36:58] <%Doomcoder> you remind me of the babe!!
[2:37:00] <+Darren716> Holy shit WWE 2k20 got even worse, the new PC patch will corrupt your save file and make you lose everything
[2:37:01] <%TheMilhouseExperience> But what about the Russian energy drink: cocaine. It’s like 4-6 times Red Bull in a single can.
[2:37:04] <%rumtumtugnutz> maybe you're too laden with piss to drink monster
[2:37:04] <Daxalog> uh oh

[2:37:20] <Tisaric> @fazoburquina I haven't had a single building degrade to timefall yet
[2:37:20] <%SlimeSlimeSlime> As long as you keep staring at the billboard monsters, they'll keep moving!
[2:37:20] <%dekkitout> The Death Stranding was the zip lines we build along the way

[2:38:50] <+dualviper25> Bustin makes me fell good
[2:38:50] <KaiserMario> @AngriestPat It's also worth building Zip-lines from Junk dealer to Film director, then up to the Elder, then down to the Distro Center
[2:38:52] <+Reizie_Etherealm> Diplomacy has failed!
[2:38:55] <Tisaric> It'd be nice if it showed the distances to every nearby zipline no matter which way you're looki ng
[2:38:55] <%Soulbishop> Bustin boards! The only way to long board!
[2:38:55] <%AncelDeLambert> @Bonkasaurusrex specifically Sam's blood
[2:38:56] <Hoanui> makes me feel good
[2:38:56] <Kaffeebohnson> premium ziplines
[2:38:56] <+RAAAAAINMAKER> Norman's immortal blood kill ghost
[2:39:03] <%TheMilhouseExperience> You pull the trigger on my... blood gun.
[2:39:08] <jacknerik> @Bonkasaurusrex Sam has special blood because he is a special boy
[2:39:09] <%Aeoneth> infastructurrrre!!
[2:39:10] <ToshiDandelion> this game is so slow i wish i could put the live stream on 2x speed

[2:39:22] <%joylent_blue> Sam as doomer blood
[2:39:24] <%joylent_blue> has
[2:39:31] <%Soulbishop> Oh the compliments have started to roll in
[2:39:32] <%FrostMass22> Hey, chat, will it be explained why Norman's fluids are special? what do you think?
[2:39:34] <stgrunu> wouldn't it be funny if the zip line broke after he ended the mission
[2:39:35] <CelioHogane> @beetbo2 the Ghoorrorist!
[2:39:41] <%shootbang_exe> lol OK DOOMer
[2:39:43] <%Shadicara> Man been forever and pat now carries a giant dong of crates on his back
[2:39:44] <thetruthofyourbeing> Does the sensor wave goodbye to the BTs?
[2:39:44] <%StrifeZubia> Bang bang bang, pull my chiral trigger
[2:39:44] <suikudo> i like that i can take a nap for like a 1-2 hours and know i didnt miss anything
[2:39:47] <beetbo2> Boomer blood = monster
[2:39:50] <%Strider222> ghost terrorists are the worst
[2:39:54] <%Doomcoder> @FrostMass22 it's 'cause he's a repatriate. the other side hates his body
[2:39:54] <%Piemen99> fuck that was close
[2:39:59] <+seaearthandsky> pat playing a dangerous game here
[2:40:12] <%TheMilhouseExperience> Sam listens to Radiohead on his mp3 during recess when he was a child.

[2:40:16] <Hellarussian> ghosts dont like the Reedus piss
[2:40:16] <ThatOneGuyYouSaw> SILENCE
[2:40:17] <%FrostMass22> @doomcoder Isn't Dead-Hardman also a repatriate?
[2:40:18] <+G_Thunders> So are BT’s humans that didn’t pass on from the beach to the afterlife, or did they get dragged out of the afterlife back here?
[2:40:22] <%J_Papa> ooh a memory chip
[2:40:25] <stgrunu> spoilers: he wont

[2:42:41] <%Meow0369> chiral items, gettings missions for other places
[2:42:42] <thetruthofyourbeing> SLEEPY PEEDUS
[2:42:42] <+valkuma> Monster Zero is okay but BANG or REIGN are better
[2:42:42] <+D00msDayDan> the ones that have repeatable rewards do, like junk dealer and craftsman
[2:42:44] <KnightAsteran> some people have unique gear for delivering to them
[2:42:44] <%shootbang_exe> or whatever that npc gives
[2:42:44] <$antibonehurtingjuice> I think Sam is dying
[2:42:50] <beetbo2> lul
[2:42:50] <Tisaric> Like the Custom Hematic Grenade guy keeps giving you grenades
[2:42:51] <%AncelDeLambert> maybe build when you DON'T have cargo to deliver, Pat
[2:42:52] <%TheMilhouseExperience> If you want their equipment yes.
[2:42:54] <+RAAAAAINMAKER> You go back for Materials, especially crystals
[2:42:56] <%Soulbishop> Wait@
[2:42:56] <+D00msDayDan> craftsman gives blood grenades, chiral artist gives boots
[2:42:57] <+korth367> sam needs a break
[2:42:59] <Akett> Give Sam a nap.
[2:43:00] <%Meow0369> remember you need to take missions to get stars in other places, so sometimes you need to go to a 5 star to get a mission for a 3 star
[2:43:01] <%AngriestAngryArtist> Oh yeah that one guy who gives you custom blood grenades
[2:43:01] <%shootbang_exe> you should probably rest somewhere lol
[2:43:03] <%Aeoneth> chiral artist and junk dealer give Chiral shit which has better dur
[2:43:05] <arkv01> sam needs beer
[2:43:06] <%Soulbishop> I know that avatar from the discord!
[2:43:07] <+fingalights> does Pat know about getting stars with BB?
[2:43:09] <%linkster291> Materials and to get missions to other places to reach rank 5.
[2:43:11] <%Soulbishop> brb
[2:43:16] <blaggablag> Some of their unique items are very useful. One of the mountain ones gives you better bloodpacks, engineer gives you better grenades, and so on
[2:43:17] <KaiserMario> @AngriestPat You can restock on unique items and materials, and also get more colors in case you missed those
[2:43:31] <+RAAAAAINMAKER> Yo go back and take their Crystals
[2:43:34] <%TheMilhouseExperience> Blood grenades chiral boots, ladders, hooks. Materials. There’s a variety
[2:43:36] <Hellarussian> teach the BB to do Triple Reppukens
[2:43:36] <+fingalights> check in the private room. how I got mine
[2:43:46] <beetbo2> NICE

[2:44:13] <KaiserMario> @AngriestPat You can farm BB likes on the mirror, wanna know a trick?
[2:44:14] <All_Salt> You can get more likes with BB by setting down and playing your harmonica song.
[2:44:19] <thetruthofyourbeing> its fine
[2:44:25] <%trashcansan> poor sam BibleThump
[2:44:33] <+G_Thunders> Practicing harmonica with BB gets you tons of likes

[2:45:38] <%Shady_Zaku> apatCaw
[2:45:51] <Daxalog> I wonder if late game the ground will be filled with abandoned Bikes and ladders and barren unused roads
[2:45:53] <beetbo2> cry
[2:45:54] <Guardiansaiyan> fix them
[2:45:56] <%Soulbishop> Spray them?
[2:45:57] <Hellarussian> build a wall to keep the BTs out
[2:46:00] <%Soulbishop> Seems logical?
[2:46:00] <beetbo2> we're goign to scream and cry
[2:46:02] <%J_Papa> @RAAAAAINMAKER Yeah I made the rounds and stole everyone's chiral stash after getting all 5-stars, it's worth it
[2:46:04] <beetbo2> like the good baby
[2:46:12] <+Reizie_Etherealm> So what's the destination again?
[2:46:17] <waifoong98> LUL
[2:46:22] <+machshop> you can just dismantle the generator
[2:46:22] <%Doomcoder> god I wish you could give likes to your BB
[2:46:22] <%joylent_blue> that's a rock, Sam
[2:46:31] <%goose_attack_almanac> @AngriestPat Baz trailer for Shovel Knight Showdown is up
[2:46:31] <beetbo2> SAM THIS IS DIEHARDMAN
[2:46:43] <beetbo2> Watch your step, Sam
[2:46:47] <%Soulbishop> Omg the creaking squeaking plastic noise
[2:46:50] <%gespenst25> Won't the super acid rain just melt all this?
[2:46:52] <beetbo2> The terrain is far too hazardous
[2:46:54] <+PenmanLupine> Go dismantle it!
[2:46:58] <beetbo2> lol
[2:47:01] <%joylent_blue> cramps D:
[2:47:02] <%TheMilhouseExperience> My BB gave me so many likes and I love him. We grew to 5 stars in our relationship.
[2:47:05] <KaiserMario> @AngriestPat On the mirror, do the " pointing guns pose" by holding left on the analog stick, and press square right as he turns and points. If done right, you get 45 likes from BB on each try.
[2:47:17] <%Doomcoder> that's awesome
[2:47:25] <Hellarussian> now dab and slam a Monster
[2:47:28] <+machshop> @gespenst25 it does over time but they can be repaired
[2:47:43] <%Soulbishop> Is that the bt forest?
[2:47:59] <%marvel877> Is he still building ziplines?
[2:48:06] <%joylent_blue> you know it
[2:48:06] <%GeneralSCPatton> @soulbishop Different region
[2:48:08] <$antibonehurtingjuice> I know what your thinking someone did this in my starting area capital to port in like 60 seconds FUCKING BONKERS
[2:48:10] <superd4v3> @marvel877 Yes, he still is
[2:48:39] <%J_Papa> Wait Pat this is a destination, don't built it on top of a rock
[2:48:47] <Tisaric> it's fiiiiiiiine
[2:48:49] <KaiserMario> @AngriestPat Build closer to Film Director
[2:48:55] <%rytisone> wasting time to save time
[2:48:55] <ThatOneGuyYouSaw> @AngriestPat stop building them, just wait for other schmucks to build you shit
[2:48:57] <%Soulbishop> Truth hurts
[2:49:07] <arkv01> @ThatOneGuyYouSaw WutFace
[2:49:08] <%Jack_of_No_Trades> Once you get the key ones laid out, go back and optimize on run 2
[2:49:13] <%AncelDeLambert> where's the fun in that?
[2:49:13] <%TheMilhouseExperience> It’s fine.
[2:49:14] <%Meow0369> that's not how that works
[2:49:23] <+Reizie_Etherealm> I wonder if anyone is gonna find these to be useful and repair them for Pat or if Pat has to repair them himself cause no one cares
[2:49:23] <+G_Thunders> Fix it after the online ziplines show up
[2:49:24] <+fingalights> but resources are free, right
[2:49:26] <Rich_In_Antioxidants> I dont understand why Pat feels the need to carry his boxes when all he's doing is bulding
[2:49:27] <+2DSuperiority> They gonna take my likes though
[2:49:29] <%Meow0369> if you wait for others it's gonna be a long bloody time to wait
[2:49:32] <%AncelDeLambert> Pat is claiming this land by peeing all over it with his ziplines
[2:49:32] <%joylent_blue> you can't possibly get enough ziplines to spawn at once to be useful
[2:49:34] <Ultimatefool> So... what part of America is this Mars hellscape?
[2:49:38] <Tisaric> online ziplines should already be up
[2:49:41] <Rich_In_Antioxidants> Just put the boxes away while building
[2:49:42] <%This_is_Marco> sometimes if you put a "want thing here" sign people do it
[2:49:42] <arkv01> @Ultimatefool kentucky
[2:49:49] <VritraReiRei> But then PAT would not get all the Likes. Pat wants ALL the Likes...
[2:49:53] <%Soulbishop> what in the mushroom hell
[2:50:02] <Tisaric> there's 2
[2:50:02] <%supersugoisenpai1> Just the chiral network bandwith
[2:50:03] <arkv01> hey I heard plague is going to be a hologram in one of these bases?
[2:50:08] <%TheMilhouseExperience> Pats in R-Kansas
[2:50:10] <screaminidiot> running out of bandwidth really sucks tho
[2:50:15] <%Keyd00d> i have countless online ziplines that connect to nothing in my world. gotta build your own
[2:50:16] <Tisaric> Pat there's 2
[2:50:18] <+fingalights> ziplines a busted. helped me tons later in
[2:50:22] <%ArcanumMBD> its out of range of the second one
[2:50:23] <Hellarussian> Plague did the mo cap for the BB
[2:50:23] <%AncelDeLambert> Pat is using these ziplines to T-Pose all over this game
[2:50:23] <Frostydough1> Yeah the main good thing about other peoples structure is that it doesnt take any of YOUR bandwidth
[2:50:23] <jacknerik> no pat you were looking at the one behind it
[2:50:23] <+StealthNeku> 500 is not that cheap
[2:50:24] <%GarbageNirvana> You're close enough
[2:50:32] <+StealthNeku> But it is cheaper than 1000
[2:50:33] <Ted_the_red> pat there's 2
[2:50:37] <%bevyrage> @AngriestPat look at the one on the right?
[2:50:37] <+2DSuperiority> it's saying that about the other one
[2:50:39] <Mister_McDerp> theres 2 pat
[2:50:46] <%Soulbishop> Pat there are two zips
[2:50:47] <%Soulbishop> lol
[2:50:49] <Hellarussian> jeez guy
[2:50:49] <%BallerSwagBro9k> 1
[2:50:51] <%Doomcoder> if it gets damaged and other people repair it, do they use any of their bandwidth or is it still all yours?

[2:55:39] <%Meow0369> you can safely jump off the zipline whenever it says jump off pat

[2:56:13] <+apocplz> @arkv01 keep watching barbEyes
[2:56:23] <%bevyrage> so i looked it up and the song sam sings is a very, very old japanese melody for hot spring bathing
[2:56:30] <%Jack_of_No_Trades> I imagine it is easy to maintain these logistically since you can ride right to them
[2:56:33] <%bevyrage> *** lyrics and definition in the article here
[2:56:35] <Tisaric> you have to make some compromises with ziplines
[2:56:38] <%gespenst25> A zipline to surpass metal gear.

[2:56:44] <+PenmanLupine> @AngriestPat if the generators are in the way, you can just dismantle them.
[2:56:45] <LunarRemix> Can't you build a bridge and place the zipline on top of the bridge?

[3:02:04] <+MoonObscure> nice
[3:02:08] <blaggablag> I CLAPPED
[3:02:12] <cheesedburgers> Those BTs must be so fucking confused by this
[3:02:14] <%J_Papa> You can totally jump off the zipline early and get on top of that shelter
[3:02:15] <%jcenderion> HE COULD ACTUALLY JUMP OFF ON IT PogChamp
[3:02:16] <%medusasghost> who needs game when zip
[3:02:18] <+Punisher7771> this should cut your arm something feirce
[3:02:19] <$Bonkasaurusrex> That was satisfying to watch
[3:02:24] <%Meow0369> They were liars
[3:02:24] <red_blaster> Is this game fun or just really addicting?
[3:02:27] <beetbo2> probably depends on how much they're used
[3:02:28] <Tisaric> Who the hell had their shoes last that long
[3:02:29] <%trashcansan> 3
[3:02:30] <%Soulbishop> Well if you stopped jumping in puddles
[3:02:32] <%TheMilhouseExperience> and yes you can drop while riding on the line.
[3:02:32] <+VideoGameTim_> @red_blaster both
[3:02:33] <%MalekDracarus> You can get 3 pairs
[3:02:34] <beetbo2> the terrain, running, etc
[3:02:34] <%shootbang_exe> both
[3:02:36] <arkv01> cheap nikes
[3:02:36] <%Meow0369> also you have been carrying like beer the entire length of an hour
[3:02:38] <%FrostMass22> Ziplines are the best thing to make at this point
[3:02:39] <Tisaric> I've gone through like 5 pairs already
[3:02:41] <blaggablag> They're bound to last a lot if you don't walk any more
[3:02:42] <%joylent_blue> red_blaster honestly what's the difference
[3:02:47] <+MazDoThing> Game is Good???
[3:02:48] <beetbo2> the more wear you put them through, the worse they'll be
[3:02:48] <+Jaysky> red_blaster it's something. Wouldn't call it terribly fun.
[3:02:49] <%J_Papa> That's because you're carrying 100 tons on your back while you build ziplines across America
[3:02:53] <Dr_Mooose> yeah, get your lore right
[3:02:54] <%shootbang_exe> no pat, it's clearly the time puddles /s
[3:02:57] <HyperBomb21> @MazDoThing game is great
[3:02:57] <+Darren716> Water still fucks your boots up tho irl
[3:02:59] <beetbo2> even with timefall out of the equaition
[3:03:03] <arkv01> yeah stop walking in poo water
[3:03:03] <KeystoneA1> !uptime
[3:03:04] <@Moobot> I've been playing this game for how long? Oh only 3h 3m.
[3:03:04] <KaiserMario> @AngriestPat If you use the vehicles more it preserves them more
[3:03:09] <TheHeroAppears> water still causes damage to shoes
[3:03:18] <%TheMilhouseExperience> I blew through 5 pairs and I have 4 chapters left. 5 stars on my third row.
[3:03:19] <%Soulbishop> It was bit pat. . .
[3:03:21] <%GeneralSCPatton> You did just make walking obsolete, so they'll last a bit.
[3:03:22] <+Eclipse_knight_> your foot stank is eating away at the shoes
[3:03:25] <%trashcansan> TRUCKIN
[3:03:29] <Rich_In_Antioxidants> how does Timefall affect the water cycle if water makes you age
[3:03:31] <%Soulbishop> You ruined the bit.
[3:03:31] <%shootbang_exe> BIG DELIVER
[3:03:42] <+Reizie_Etherealm> What about the beer on you right now?
[3:03:44] <jacknerik> @MazDoThing It is VERY well made and an amazing game for *some* people. Whether or not it is good is personal preference
[3:03:45] <%This_is_Marco> wheres pizza?!
[3:03:48] <Dingo_Eejit> @pat, "puddles don't age shoes" tell that to my old man 30 years ago!
[3:03:50] <%GeneralSCPatton> @rich_in_antioxidants The effects go away after it touches stuff

[3:06:07] <%AncelDeLambert> is Pat trying to do everything at once?
[3:06:07] <%Soulbishop> That makes me kinda sad. . . A multiplayer where you could coop deliveries or do timed runs head to head would be pretty cool

[3:06:12] <R3c0n31> OH nO

[3:09:41] <%psydaku> so this is middle america
[3:09:44] <Rich_In_Antioxidants> why doesnt the road have guard rails?
[3:09:47] <%Deadpal> slow down to turn bro!
[3:09:57] <%Deadpal> can you not BUILD guard rails?
[3:10:00] <+Reizie_Etherealm> It's so you can leave at any point
[3:10:01] <%Strider222> pat you should keep on keeping on
[3:10:01] <suikudo> it would cost more to build
[3:10:02] <%radda343> guardrails are for cowards
[3:10:02] <+Punisher7771> com on pat messup
[3:10:02] <ChrisM341> anxiety Stranding

[3:10:09] <+kenji_not_genji> What episode is this?
[3:10:10] <KaiserMario> I hate when there's vehicles right on the middle of the road!
[3:10:10] <%StrifeZubia> Man this is gonna look like a great episode of RIDE with Normal Reedus
[3:10:11] <+walternatorz> they didn't account for drunk drivers
[3:10:12] <Mister_McDerp> america is dead and so are safety standards
[3:10:14] <IntrepidDolphin> considering you have nothign on you, you can fragile jump back and then do the delivery that was left behind
[3:10:14] <ChoculaUltra> guard rails have no business in the porter business
[3:10:17] <%Alpha8087> Okay Pat, off to EX/Savage. be back later hopefully!
[3:10:17] <mrblack499> dont drink and drive
[3:10:29] <+RAAAAAINMAKER> The guardrails are invisible and activate when your going a certain speed, that way you can't be launched off the road
[3:10:30] <+HyraFukit> America might have OSHA but we dont follow it.
[3:10:36] <+Imn0tacop> guard rails are for losers
[3:10:40] <%TheMilhouseExperience> Safety standards are for cowards and the weak.
[3:10:46] <%Strider222> B E E R
[3:10:49] <+Imn0tacop> only real men drive without guard rails
[3:10:50] <Demon_chann> gee i sure would like a MONSTER ENERGY UNLEASH THE BEAST (TM) right now

[3:13:11] <%valriot> @angriestpat It's from a side order at Mamas Workshop
[3:13:13] <thetruthofyourbeing> That guy looks like norman reedus from ride on amc
[3:13:14] <%marvel877> you need a memory chip for that
[3:13:14] <%shootbang_exe> just clear out the mule camps and you'll find it easy
[3:13:15] <+Reizie_Etherealm> What's the current plan?
[3:13:17] <Demon_chann> do you think people tell sam that he looks like norman reedus frim ride on amc?
[3:13:18] <%Thorlias> has pat progressed the story AT ALL since last stream? apatWhat
[3:13:19] <%deviljhojho_> remember to watch ride with norman reedus on AMC while you drink a refreshing can of Monster Energy
[3:13:19] <Saunt> I like that Pats sub animation is timed so well with Sam running

[3:15:34] <jimmytwofeet> NO YOU FUCKY
[3:15:34] <%xtremegamer80> Honestly does it matter if you use robots or not? I thought the point of them is to complete delivers you don't care about?
[3:15:37] <%TheMilhouseExperience> Closer to*

[3:16:30] <$Yakobro> triangles are stronger than squares

[3:16:39] <Vlesh> You can always get higher, Pat
[3:16:39] <dukenux> you idiot, you absolute buffoon, triangles dont exist
[3:16:40] <%TheMilhouseExperience> See that mountain. Nice view from the top.
[3:16:41] <+fingalights> triangles are my favorite shape
[3:16:44] <+Eclipse_knight_> a square is just two triangles
[3:16:52] <+HyraFukit> @Eclipse_knight_ you take that back
[3:16:55] <Demon_chann> i dont belive in geometry
[3:17:04] <Vlesh> That's going to be a sick ride starring Norman Reedus on AMC
[3:17:13] <%deviljhojho_> actually, here's my death stranding theory: The only thing on tv is Ride with norman reedus, and the only energy drink remaining is monster energy. They are not ads, they are just ubiquitous to the setting
[3:17:15] <Demon_chann> is that show actually good
[3:17:17] <%Doomcoder> ah
[3:17:19] <%Doomcoder> the scalene triangle
[3:17:25] <%J_Papa> Sometimes it's better to build it higher than max out the distance

[3:27:59] <+8framelag> ...but I need to make ONE more delivery!
[3:27:59] <%Meow0369> Dunkey lied though, legit he lied about some of it
[3:28:01] <+Promessa_EX> dunky has no taste though
[3:28:01] <HipHopAnonymous23> Dunkey was right, but thats why its great
[3:28:02] <Gruntini> GOD this game is so fucking werid
[3:28:03] <+VideoGameTim_> damn that sucks you saw the video pat, theres big spoilers in it
[3:28:08] <+Promessa_EX> dunky hates chrono trigger
[3:28:10] <Monkeyweed21> didn't Dunkey deliberately play wrong to make the game look worse
[3:28:10] <+valkuma> the thing about dunkey is that its not a nintendo game so he hates it.
[3:28:11] <dukenux> Death Stranding is the epitome of "acquired taste"
[3:28:12] <Darkrenai> Dunkey is overrated
[3:28:13] <%Meow0369> Dunkey made a lot of shit upthat just wasn'ttrue
[3:28:15] <artoflec> Yeah it's like liking that new pokemon game elaSmile
[3:28:15] <%GarbageNirvana> The game is what it is, and you're either on board or you're not
[3:28:17] <OldManDeckardCain> dunkey also hates RPGs LUL
[3:28:19] <%roxikat> Daytonaaaaaa
[3:28:19] <+valkuma> dunkey is extremely overrated
[3:28:19] <+VideoGameTim_> also dunkey is super overrated and a hack
[3:28:19] <%Laecerelius> dunkey loves trying to do everything the hardest way and then complain about it it seems
[3:28:20] <dukenux> if you don't like it, you won't like it
[3:28:22] <worldbrand> i accidentally deliver food from all of your favourite restaurants in over 300 cities throughout the United States and Canada
[3:28:22] <%Meow0369> Also pat you watched that video? It had so many spoilers in it
[3:28:23] <%Doomcoder> this game sucks and also is great. it's not so bad it's good, it's just so bad. and so good
[3:28:23] <%deviljhojho_> i dunno, i have watched reviews of dunkey of games that I have played and I almost always hard disagree with him
[3:28:25] <%Seraphile> i like this game's gameplay, don't really give a shit about its plot
[3:28:26] <$ArtemisCroc> @Meow0369 Dunkey has never ever ever been a serious reviewer, nobody should ever treat him as such
[3:28:27] <%TheMilhouseExperience> Only if you lack creativity to approach situations
[3:28:28] <%deviljhojho_> i dont trust his reviews
[3:28:29] <+Reizie_Etherealm> Even if you can't access the good stuff, doesn't mean that good stuff isn't there. You just can't get to it because of your own personal reasons.
[3:28:29] <+keyoray> I have a feeling it's taking advantage of a happy feedback loop in certain qualities of humans.
[3:28:30] <%Doomcoder> it truly is a mysterious jogo
[3:28:32] <HyperBomb21> haters are just going to spam his opinions everywhere now
[3:28:33] <%Seraphile> cool worldbuilding and sam is good
[3:28:34] <+RootVeggie> Dunky has weird tastes, he says that Splatoon is a horrible game
[3:28:36] <%J_Papa> It's important to remember Dunkey's previous video about reviewers, that you need to know THEIR preferences too
[3:28:37] <%Typhaeon> I liked when he was doing prank calls & one guy just instantly recognized him
[3:28:38] <Akett> Death Stranding seems like a very "my kind of SHIT" type of game.
[3:28:38] <ChrisM341> Dunkey also hated the last of us on his first playthrough but liked it later on
[3:28:40] <thetruenicster> but then again, is dunkey really someone we should be taking into consideration with opinions?
[3:28:41] <+zombibyte_> He seemed to play like shit on purpose
[3:28:43] <%DracaenaLeaf> I liked Yahtzee's review
[3:28:46] <CelioHogane> Death stranding is an mmo but without the combat side, that's how i view the game.
[3:28:47] <%Meow0369> @ArtemisCroc Oh please, he makes dunkviews and complains about how other games journalists aren't consistent or good at it
[3:28:48] <Monkeyweed21> Dunkey played wrong on purpose to make the game look worse
[3:28:51] <+thewaifoo> the progression on this is amazing tho
[3:28:52] <elspiceweasel> Vrooooom
[3:28:54] <+DesertPenguin> @AngriestPat Needs more Daft Punk background music when driving around
[3:28:57] <+8framelag> i need a tag as the 'road warrior/builder' why is it so addictive
[3:28:59] <KaiserMario> It's one of those "You're not wrong dude, you're just an idiot" type things... But I guess that is intentional
[3:29:02] <%Meow0369> @ArtemisCroc he wants to be seen as a legit reviewer in his dunkview videos
[3:29:03] <+VideoGameTim_> @ArtemisCroc ironic shitposting is still shitposting, especially when misrepresenting the games
[3:29:04] <dukenux> Wow, this really makes you feel like you're watching Ride with Norman Reedus on AMC
[3:29:04] <DaCheekyOne> Is this all there is to it?
[3:29:09] <%TheMilhouseExperience> God I hate that poison chasm. But it made the sticky gun useful to me.
[3:29:10] <%Seraphile> are people legit getting upset about dunkey reviews
[3:29:16] <$ArtemisCroc> @Meow0369 my point is that nobody should be paying attention to him, not that he gets a pass
[3:29:17] <+SickBangerzM9> im gonna be honest this looks really boring
[3:29:19] <mikesapartment> 20k tops
[3:29:24] <$ArtemisCroc> you guys are dumb
[3:29:25] <Ipsenscastle> PAT watch out, a rock!
[3:29:28] <%J_Papa> Where's that MULE with the arm of Zeus to deny your highway ride
[3:29:28] <+SickBangerzM9> and ive been here watching since you started
[3:29:30] <%Meow0369> @ArtemisCroc Sure, but people do pay attention to him, that's a fact
[3:29:32] <%Seraphile> like its 7/10 BoTW shit, just reviewer preference
[3:29:32] <startstoprepeat> i've 5 starred most of the world now and i'm at 30k
[3:29:33] <Mastigias> Death Stranding is just Animal Crossing for edgelords
[3:29:33] <%trashcansan> the good ol america data cap
[3:29:33] <$PulverKong> Why do people even get upset about reviews in the first place? it's just one dude's opinion
[3:29:33] <%marsanta> You get a bunch more each area you add
[3:29:34] <%shootbang_exe> save a decent amount for the mountains
[3:29:34] <cheesedburgers> After beating it the more I think about it the more I think I hate this game but I still love it just as much as I hate it
[3:29:35] <+8framelag> this game really needs mgsv's soundtrack feature
[3:29:35] <SpaceGuntank> people just need to stop asking "is the game good" and need to figure out of its right for/intresting to them instead.
[3:29:36] <Koosahmii> It milks just the right parts of your brain to give you a feeling of progress and accomplishment
[3:29:37] <%deviljhojho_> haha yeah man, i know how you feel, i was watching Ride with Norman Reedus on AMC and I tought the exact same thing
[3:29:39] <%shootbang_exe> no spoilers but trust me
[3:29:44] <mrblack499> just buy more?
[3:29:44] <+keyoray> @dukenux I really want to watch Ride with Norman Reedus now. :)
[3:29:45] <%ArchimerDreatect> it seems like a lot of people had preconcieved notions of what this game 'should' be. the replacement to metal gear, a spite-game, another mgsv engine clone. seems to be exactly what it is and that bothers people.
[3:29:47] <%TheMilhouseExperience> You get more when you 5 star places.
[3:29:53] <%Seraphile> @Mastigias that sounds like a game right up my alley
[3:29:54] <%Meow0369> Pat dunkeys video had a lot of spoilers in them
[3:29:56] <%SaiyanShoto> I ended up having to delete shit cause I put too many zip lines and it took all my bandwidth
[3:29:58] <%Meow0369> I hope you didn't ruin it for you
[3:29:59] <Divantae> where there are negative reviews there are positive reviews somewhere
[3:30:02] <+Evitron1> i'm at like 24k bandwidth max right now?
[3:30:04] <$ArtemisCroc> who cares what dunkey fans think of games, they're all small children anyway
[3:30:06] <$PulverKong> This reminds me of Ride To Hell Retribution
[3:30:07] <HyperBomb21> that's not true, I have 25k
[3:30:08] <IntrepidDolphin> from here go fragile teleport back
[3:30:09] <$ArtemisCroc> not like they can buy games
[3:30:12] <+Vikingdeath1> Yeah I ran out of Bandwidth last night... so I had to progress the game past chapter 5 :/
[3:30:13] <+RootVeggie> Dunkey is a reviewer in the same way that Egoraptor is a reviewer
[3:30:13] <mikesapartment> i meant +20k more tops
[3:30:19] <%deviljhojho_> THE LEGEND
[3:30:22] <%Meow0369> Pat you can get like 30-40k chiral
[3:30:25] <artoflec> i doubt story spoilers would have much context anyway
[3:30:26] <%shootbang_exe> time for truck?
[3:30:27] <%GarbageNirvana> Man there were some apatBig spoils in that
[3:30:29] <@lewdskeletor13> Why are people so mad that a man did not like this game
[3:30:31] <SpaceGuntank> LEGENDARY BEER PogChamp
[3:30:32] <$antibonehurtingjuice> jesus
[3:30:33] <dukenux> Crap
[3:30:33] <+SickBangerzM9> what i didnt like about mgsv was the boring running between locations and kojima made exactly that with some neat item management and crafting
[3:30:34] <$PulverKong> never heard of the guy
[3:30:35] <%Meow0369> I'm almost 5 star everything and I think I'm at around 30k
[3:30:38] <%supersugoisenpai1> Dunkey is pretty much the opposite of my tastes
[3:30:43] <jimmytwofeet> pp
[3:30:46] <suikudo> How dare he not love what i love
[3:30:47] <Gi_judd_617> Dunkey spoiled RE7s final boss
[3:30:48] <%trashcansan> @lewdskeletor13 because things to like the thing that they like
[3:30:50] <%Laecerelius> Beefier boy
[3:30:51] <ChrisM341> Death Stranding for Stadia Kappa
[3:30:53] <elspiceweasel> but you have to like the things i like!
[3:30:55] <%Doomcoder> has he ever lost consciousness?
[3:30:58] <ArtoriasTheTrenchfighter> Ready to deliver to the Mojave Desert
[3:30:59] <%thenumber5point5> @angriestpat it's the zip lines, they are supercool and useful but they will eat bandwidth fast
[3:31:00] <%rumtumtugnutz> Sam porter bridges looks like Daryl Dixon from Walking Dead. or the guy from Boondock Saints.
[3:31:02] <%GeneralSCPatton> @gi_judd_617 What a fuck
[3:31:02] <xanerts> there was one mild spoiler
[3:31:03] <$Kenzo2000> You get an extra 5k bandwidth around when Troy Baker quits the game and the get Matt Mercer
[3:31:07] <%Meow0369> Don't you'll lose your boots
[3:31:08] <+keyoray> How's the BB?
[3:31:08] <%shootbang_exe> rest, teleport, then DRINK MOINSTER
[3:31:09] <KaiserMario> There were some huge ones, he doesn't really care about spoiling peole it seems...
[3:31:11] <+DesertPenguin> so many cutscenes just to fucking fast travel. Not so fast huh
[3:31:11] <dukenux> Fragilay
[3:31:12] <braaklyn> Pat, did you notice how Sam’s last name is “Bridges” because he’s trying to “Bridge” people together. Get it, Pat? Do you get the subtlety of the main character’s name?
[3:31:15] <%Meow0369> You're gonna lose your cool spare boots
[3:31:16] <%J_Papa> I haven't seen Pat get knocked out yet
[3:31:19] <Divantae> @Gi_judd_617 lmao seriously
[3:31:20] <artoflec> I just don't feel the need to voice what i don't like about htis game I guess. I feel like people that like the game already get why most people don't like it lol.
[3:31:21] <elspiceweasel> is she italian?
[3:31:22] <%supersugoisenpai1> Oh man, Build a zipline through that forest by the wind farm
[3:31:28] <$PulverKong> I remember on somethingawful someone threatened to report the reviewer of FF8 to SQUARE SOFT and have the site TAKEN DOWN
[3:31:29] <%lord_hades> Huh my sub expires on my birthday so I’m gonna pay you on my birthday
[3:31:30] <artificiallynatural> But spherehunter liked the game so which internet personality do I align my opinions with?
[3:31:30] <+8framelag> ui and some stuff could really be streamlined
[3:31:31] <+keigatide> @braaklyn What? I haven't played this but I thought his name was porter
[3:31:31] <%deviljhojho_> its actually pronounced Frah goi leu
[3:31:33] <%Doomcoder> @braaklyn Sam Porter Ziplines
[3:31:35] <+SickBangerzM9> anti-subtlety the game

[3:31:45] <@lewdskeletor13> This game really does make me want to watch Ride with Norman Reedus on AMC
[3:31:46] <%shootbang_exe> btw, not sure if you've noticed but some npcs need you to rest and read emails before you can complete a star
[3:31:47] <ChoculaUltra> the only LPs of Death Stranding I've been following are Woolie's, Pat's, and Kizuna Ai's.

[3:35:47] <artoflec> @G_Thunders 😩
[3:35:49] <thetruthofyourbeing> youre giving me anxiety
[3:35:49] <+RAAAAAINMAKER> You know if you kill the BTs by the road they respawn somewhere else and don't trigger the animation when you drive by after that
[3:35:51] <dukenux> Tantrum? THat drink from HIMYM?

[3:36:13] <%TheMilhouseExperience> It’s fine
[3:36:15] <UnfilteredComic> Pat you should try this in real life :)
[3:36:19] <$PulverKong> what's the twitch special event that just started?
[3:36:19] <HeadsHeldHigh> enjoyoy
[3:36:23] <Monkeyweed21> cool you didnt miss anything important
[3:36:24] <BlueRoguue> tomatoConcern
[3:36:24] <cheesedburgers> I can’t wait until someone posts “Death Stranding: The Movie” in 10 parts of all the cutscenes and codecs and cool setpieces, like people do for Uncharted. Probably more digestible
[3:36:27] <%Laecerelius> That truck in the middle of the road is so super rusted by now
[3:36:28] <%chiluzza> is it as RADICAL as RADICAL HEIGHTS
[3:36:30] <mrblack499> dont text and drive
[3:36:32] <%Seraphile> @AngriestPat what definition of radical
[3:36:32] <beetbo2> Big peepee Pat avoids a car crash
[3:36:39] <%CaptainKarite> tomatoDevious
[3:36:41] <HeadsHeldHigh> dont read donations and drive kids
[3:36:44] <%trashcansan> @cheesedburgers they kinda already did
[3:36:48] <%Meow0369> I like that he made a game free from a commitee
[3:36:49] <%J_Papa> Pat what's another game that gave you the same feeling as Death Stranding?
[3:36:49] <EmilieTangent> @cheesedburgers it's on youtube and it's 11 hours
[3:36:53] <+SickBangerzM9> id give this game a shot if it wasnt 60 bucks. investing that much money for a shot in the dark is not smart
[3:36:54] <arkv01> kojimas not going to make games anymore, movies now
[3:36:56] <suikudo> thats opinions there chief
[3:36:56] <dukenux> Im really surprised how much you enjoying it, and how much I enjoy watching you playing it @AngriestPat
[3:36:57] <NotHereToStream> kojima just doesn't given fuck
[3:36:58] <%Laecerelius> Underwater escort missions?
[3:36:58] <braaklyn> So are the roads affected by timefall?
[3:36:58] <$PulverKong> just download Desert Bus and play that for 8 hours
[3:37:00] <professormorrigan> dunkey loved it Kappa
[3:37:00] <%Ranryu692> @AngriestPat I don't think I'm going to enjoy playing this game, but I'm gonna buy it because what if I like the next Kojima Production
[3:37:01] <%SlimeSlimeSlime> This game is like a huge playground testing site for their future games, a taste of what's to come.
[3:37:01] <mayorrev> @AngriestPat do you think metal gear will ever be the same?
[3:37:03] <+keyoray> did monster ultra zero always have that raised design?
[3:37:04] <%Meow0369> It's a game without any of the bullshit that publishers demand of you
[3:37:05] <+DesertPenguin> Yea
[3:37:05] <%This_is_Marco> factorio
[3:37:08] <+DesertPenguin> Lots of open travel
[3:37:08] <%BallerSwagBro9k> I want Kojima to blatantly RIP off MG in a game LUL
[3:37:08] <brandanvh> You know, with how irrationally angry some people are with the kind of game this is, imagine if people reacted like that to games like eurotruck simulator and other such games, they'd sound crazy.
[3:37:09] <%xtremegamer80> Kojima could make FUCKING SOLITAIRE radical
[3:37:10] <%Explodincatz> he made it semi-mmo cause people can help each other
[3:37:13] <+Sp3ctre48> I hope it influences more devs to just make more weird shit
[3:37:15] <worldbrand> kojima could make a game about turn-based tax reports and it would be fascinating
[3:37:17] <%jcenderion> Yeah they do have a similar feel
[3:37:22] <%TheMilhouseExperience> The only thing missing in this game is a parachute.
[3:37:23] <HyperBomb21> This game has a similar pacing to monster Hunter, as absurd as that sounds
[3:37:24] <HeadsHeldHigh> whats the IRL lifespan of asphalt
[3:37:26] <%MrPenguin30> MrPenguin30 subscribed with Twitch Prime. They've subscribed for 2 months! 
[3:37:27] <%Doomcoder> wow
[3:37:28] <startstoprepeat> every time someone else builds a road it'll repair yours
[3:37:28] <+ClaudeMcGarren> @BallerSwagBro9k im praying for that day he says fuck you it was mine lol
[3:37:28] <artoflec> @Meow0369 i feel like its solely the bullshit
[3:37:30] <ChrisM341> Is this the Seinfeld of games?
[3:37:30] <ChoculaUltra> for me, it's the ending E credit sequence of Nier Automata that resonates a lot with Death Stranding.
[3:37:31] <+dualviper25> yea i can see that MGS 5 basically had a kidnap simulator game in it and it wass the HYPEST thing in it
[3:37:33] <Monkeyweed21> people CONSTANTLY donate repair materials for likes
[3:37:34] <+Promessa_EX> play eurotruck simulator or be a delivery man in elitye dangerous
[3:37:34] <+DesertPenguin> Asphalt lasts decades
[3:37:36] <raminnoodle420> Hardy roads
[3:37:42] <Angry_Ev1L> people you play with repair roads all the time too
[3:37:56] <dukenux> Asphalt that was laid WELL can last couple decades
[3:37:56] <$PulverKong> I can't for Pat to drive off the road while reading subs
[3:37:56] <%lotharrio> This'll be an interesting game to play in like... three years, when the majority of the player base is gone.
[3:37:58] <Monkeyweed21> Repairing built roads is EASY LIKES
[3:37:59] <+Reizie_Etherealm> A handcrafted mundane thing can become special depending on the amount of love put into it
[3:38:00] <Rich_In_Antioxidants> when twitch stops working Pat should stream on pornhub
[3:38:01] <Angry_Ev1L> yeah? SHOW STATS
[3:38:03] <SpaceGuntank> i like how you can tell how many people fell off the roads by all the lost cargo at the edges
[3:38:06] <$PulverKong> I can't WAIT for Pat to drive off the road while reading subs
[3:38:07] <dukenux> shit one can start crumblign after few years
[3:38:10] <cheesedburgers> Roads are so OP everyone always keeps them healthy
[3:38:11] <hawkofgp> @SickBangerzM9 well every new game is the same. No reason to buy any game for 60 bucks unless you are sure it's worth it for you
[3:38:13] <%VantomPayne> @worldbrand i mean, knowing that tax report will somehow involve nukes, yeah it would be interesting at least
[3:38:16] <ScreamLord> @AngriestPat Kojima's game developing philosophy has always to make Memorable games, not necessarily good ones. Luckily tho most of his games are fairly decent
[3:38:16] <%Meow0369> That's not how road building works, it's kinda weird
[3:38:17] <%J_Papa> I can't confirm this but I believe you are forced to finish all the roads yourself after the first few
[3:38:19] <dukenux> Depends on weather conditions also, obv
[3:38:19] <%Explodincatz> u helped finish the roads
[3:38:20] <Monkeyweed21> PAT IS BIG BUILDER BOY
[3:38:21] <%PlainSimpleTailor> They'd better PAY YOU. ANCAP FTW
[3:38:26] <$HyperionXV> I wonder if the PC release is gonna get crossplay sort of thing for the online
[3:38:28] <NotHereToStream> roads ignore bts and mules, of course its good
[3:38:31] <narusao> your driving on the Pat Interstate Highway
[3:38:38] <%TheMilhouseExperience> Wait until later. It’s something.
[3:38:39] <ChoculaUltra> @lotharrio I'm interested too. There's still a group that plays MGSV in efforts to disarm all nukes online and they're still going strong.
[3:38:39] <dukenux> In cold, wet climate roads need to be repaired more than in dry one
[3:38:42] <+Promessa_EX> but strands
[3:38:42] <blaggablag> Do roads take up bandwidth?
[3:38:43] <%psydaku> psydaku subscribed with Twitch Prime. They've subscribed for 3 months! should i wait to do side missions? if so, how long?
[3:38:43] <beetbo2> Pat has the biggest, most helpful peepee roads
[3:38:46] <+SickBangerzM9> @hawkofgp i know what genre it is and what the percentage gameplay it is before i buy any game. i couldnt tell with death stranding. i expected more mule gameplay
[3:38:48] <Angry_Ev1L> roads work in a way that EVERYBODY build the most of them in their games
[3:38:48] <$PulverKong> noone will bother playing the PC release
[3:38:55] <Monkeyweed21> PATRICK "MINECRAFT" BOIVIN
[3:38:56] <Manwad> I love how alien the MULE scanner sounds
[3:38:56] <+Reizie_Etherealm> What other game focus on the community aspect to help the gameplay function?
[3:38:57] <$PulverKong> it's way too late
[3:39:01] <%Doomcoder> I'm waiting for the PC release
[3:39:02] <ChrisM341> I want to see how the world will look after a few months of people playing it
[3:39:06] <dukenux> MODS
[3:39:08] <+Reizie_Etherealm> I'm waiting for the PC myself
[3:39:10] <+DesertPenguin> So are you in one "shard" or server for Montreal area?
[3:39:10] <Animal_Farm4> Dank mods will keep the PC version alive if nothing else
[3:39:10] <+8framelag> pc cheats
[3:39:10] <$OranHexthief> could you imagine if they let you make private servers for this and the kind of mods for structures that could be made
[3:39:12] <$ArtemisCroc> people wait for PC releases all the time

[3:39:18] <CelioHogane> PC release = SOLID SNAKE MOD
[3:39:18] <%Seraphile> did horizon zero dawn ever have a hint of PC release?
[3:39:20] <SpaceGuntank> has pat decided what to name his highway system?
[3:39:21] <jacknerik> I'm gonna play the shit out the PC release
[3:39:24] <ChoculaUltra> you can probably mod it so you move around as BB and carry Sam.
[3:39:25] <$PulverKong> nude mods?
[3:39:26] <dukenux> Theres so much modding potential for this
[3:39:26] <%J_Papa> I will probably buy this game again on PC, even after the 200 hours i'll spend on the PS4
[3:39:27] <Ultimatefool> As if there aren't MILLIONS of people waiting for a naked Norman Reedus model
[3:39:28] <worldbrand> there's gonna be so many vehicles
[3:39:29] <%thenumber5point5> from what the reddit has theory crafted is that most likely you build most of the roads in your world, but others plays fill in a % of the road progress
[3:39:29] <suikudo> ill pirate it
[3:39:31] <@commanderclaw> Source Filmmaker
[3:39:31] <%GarbageNirvana> Every BT is Macho Man Randy Savage

[3:50:24] <@Moobot> I've been playing this game for how long? Oh only 3h 50m.
[3:50:24] <%cureneckbeard> thanks remilia
[3:50:29] <dukenux> @GeneralSCPatton oh so dead
[3:50:32] <superd4v3> I fucking hate Touhou, go ahead, bite me
[3:50:32] <tyrano191> Did he find special bike
[3:50:42] <+NitronStreams> Reedus at this point is just draining his blood into milk jugs
[3:50:44] <SpaceGuntank> holy shit thats a lot
[3:50:47] <%Nobrev> THE TOWER
[3:50:48] <VritraReiRei> Before this game existed, I never realized how many Anime Avatars there were on the Playstation store LUL
[3:50:53] <$PulverKong> I just watched Paige drunkenly sing a sonic song I don't know how to handle this
[3:50:54] <%GeneralSCPatton> They've got cryptobiotes, so he can speedrun his blood donation
[3:50:55] <cheesedburgers> God think about how much of his blood is currently in circulation for all those grenades used countrywide and basically every tool on you like Norman should be bedridden for the rest of his life
[3:51:05] <Demon_chann> is either anime or kratos or taht guy from prototype
[3:51:06] <ScreamLord> Elmo is proof that not all Cats are soulless manipulators
[3:51:06] <+RAAAAAINMAKER> Bring some PCC's, you may wanna lay down some zips
[3:51:06] <dukenux> Normal people give blood with iv drip, Norman needs a bucket
[3:51:10] <Verriand> theres a princess diana theme on the playstation store
[3:51:21] <%J_Papa> Well there won't be a network yet
[3:51:24] <Ipsenscastle> Bleed with Norman Reedus
[3:51:26] <superd4v3> @Verriand wtf LUL
[3:51:29] <tyrano191> True
[3:51:32] <%JuliusGemstone> 8o
[3:51:38] <+2DSuperiority> Eternal vampires are unaffected by the timefall so they should be doing the deliveries
[3:51:38] <Verriand> it's like 4 bucks
[3:51:39] <+Godjaw> Is there a clip or vod of us meeting mama, I wanna keep up with the story
[3:51:43] <+brightman42> bled
[3:51:43] <$PulverKong> Ride to Hell: Death Stranding
[3:51:43] <%JuliusGemstone> @superd4v3
[3:51:55] <+robert_edwards> take a bola gun
[3:51:56] <+RAAAAAINMAKER> You will not build the road to Mountain Knot city, it's like 14 sections and most of them suck
[3:51:56] <tyrano191> Yeah more roads
[3:51:57] <Ipsenscastle> @2DSuperiority that's such a good point
[3:52:00] <sovayell> that highway is a resource pit, but worth it
[3:52:03] <+brightman42> bleed the preppers dry
[3:52:04] <IntrepidDolphin> i tihink there's a truck at the back
[3:52:04] <+paladinstarbuster> Make your own
[3:52:06] <%thenumber5point5> Pat south knot will send you there via story in like a mission or 2
[3:52:13] <+V0idWaIker> @godjaw We haven’t met her in person yet
[3:52:14] <%JuliusGemstone> y
[3:52:16] <rumuloh> Do it, do road now do big rad
[3:52:17] <cheesedburgers> The mountain knot roads aren’t worth the fuckin trouble
[3:52:19] <ChrisM341> @pulverkong I'd pay to see that lol
[3:52:21] <%Doomcoder> That's super untrue, we met her last part.
[3:52:29] <%Doomcoder> We got her tragic backstory and everything.
[3:52:30] <%Meow0369> That's a lie
[3:52:34] <%Meow0369> One guy strikes agtain
[3:52:35] <Verriand> zipline the mountains, road the rest
[3:52:43] <%XeroSigmaPrime> THATS A FUCKING LIE
[3:52:46] <Verriand> @pipboy344 Told you
[3:52:49] <+V0idWaIker> Shit mb
[3:52:50] <Angry_Ev1L> BUILD THE ROADS
[3:52:50] <@Moobot> I don't know if I can trust that. (@pipboy344) (warning)
[3:52:51] <%Doomcoder> It's all on the previous VOD
[3:52:52] <IntrepidDolphin> also you can probably grab some materials from the craftsman to finish the road
[3:52:53] <%Divryne> Florida man vs Oneguy.
[3:52:53] <dukenux> jermaOneguy
[3:52:54] <$PulverKong> @ChrisM341 you don't have to, it's on her instagrams
[3:52:55] <Mister_McDerp> jermaOneguy
[3:52:56] <%J_Papa> If only vampires had an interest in space exploration, they could make any trip
[3:52:56] <$ArtemisCroc> One Guy only gets stronger
[3:52:57] <%Meow0369> Pat's chat has a stand, it's one guy
[3:52:59] <Angry_Ev1L> don't listen to this fuckign cowards
[3:53:01] <%Laecerelius> Mountain rooooads take me hooooome!
[3:53:04] <%xtremegamer80> Wait, the anchor by the wind farm is JUST deteriorating?
[3:53:10] <%Nobrev> my STAND O N E G U Y
[3:53:13] <%XeroSigmaPrime> The first 3 roads in MTn Knot sucks, BUT THE REST SAVE YOU HOURS OF TIME
[3:53:16] <+2DSuperiority> dancing beach skeletons is the best PS4 theme
[3:53:33] <%Doomcoder> 「ONE GUY」
[3:53:37] <+zombibyte_> The mountain knot preppers need a zip line system their so tedious to walk to and back
[3:53:38] <$PulverKong> @ChrisM341 my brain kept switching between "damn she hot" and "damn she duuumm"
[3:53:40] <sovayell> @AngriestPat are the ludens glasses tacky gold too to complete the set?
[3:53:46] <rumuloh> The one guy is actually right, it just becomes untrue as soon as Pat reads it out
[3:53:48] <%Ranryu692> It has to be a song name guys
[3:53:50] <%thenumber5point5> 100% those Mtn Knot roads.. took a minute but made things alot easyier
[3:53:54] <SpaceGuntank> have any of the other roads even been built by other people or has pat done all the work?
[3:53:57] <Monkeyweed21> you can pick up more materials at craftsman
[3:53:58] <Verriand> The best part about the Diana theme is that it has 1 rating of 5 stars. 1 person really liked it.
[3:53:59] <Ipsenscastle> PS3 had better themes, somehow
[3:54:09] <%Ranryu692> Pat's chat's stand name is "Bigmouth Strikes Again"
[3:54:11] <dukenux> Mt. Knot roads, take me home
[3:54:11] <%Doomcoder> The Bloodborne theme is pretty good though
[3:54:14] <%J_Papa> What's he doing, loading up for roads?
[3:54:16] <ChrisM341> @pulverkong lol nothing wrong with either
[3:54:20] <+brightman42> preppers don't need mats
[3:54:28] <sovayell> One-Guyman
[3:54:29] <$Yakobro> TRUCKIN'
[3:54:29] <Angry_Ev1L> ROADS
[3:54:34] <%oktavia_von> journey theme wa good
[3:54:36] <rumuloh> ROAD TRIP
[3:54:37] <%Nobrev> ps3 themes were infinitely more creative with their icons than ps4 themes
[3:54:44] <Angry_Ev1L> if you don't rebuild america's crumbling infrastructure WHY EVEN PLAY
[3:54:49] <+RAAAAAINMAKER> Just counted, there are 22 sections of road left to build to mountain Knot from the Craftman
[3:54:52] <Ipsenscastle> roads are their own reward
[3:55:01] <%This_is_Marco> thats nice pat
[3:55:02] <%TheWinged7> @AngriestPat to add to the on the nose stuff in this game: "the main character's last name, Stand, also means Beach in the Scandinavian languages"
[3:55:06] <dukenux> "Look mom!"
[3:55:06] <+dualviper25> SPEEDWAGON
[3:55:07] <$DarkKnightGrave> GONNA FILL THIS WAGON
[3:55:08] <+SickBangerzM9> one zipline at a time
[3:55:10] <%jcenderion> apatCanada
[3:55:14] <elspiceweasel> AMERICA NEEDS ZIPLINES PAIGE
[3:55:16] <+robert_edwards> Okami theme on ps3 is ace
[3:55:18] <+V0idWaIker> One guy is just Crazy Talk spreading its influence
[3:55:18] <$DarkKnightGrave> GONNA FILL IT GOOD
[3:55:20] <%Doomcoder> Pat I don't know how to break it to you but this is not entirely accurate to America
[3:55:21] <%dekkitout> It'd be perfect
[3:55:21] <+D00msDayDan> to hell with the chiral network, the zipline network is where it's at
[3:55:23] <worldbrand> Rebuild the railway, this time without slaves
[3:55:26] <blaggablag> MAKE AMERICA WHORE AGAIN
[3:55:26] <+Daidis> the one highway of canada
[3:55:28] <Verriand> if you're gonna use the road, AT LEAST DRIVE ON THE RIGHT SIDE OF IT
[3:55:30] <%thenumber5point5> Pat Eisenhower all up in here
[3:55:30] <Psyramics> there's nothing north of it, who cares
[3:55:31] <%chaumiester> Wait... South Park wasn't making a joke....? You guys only have one road?
[3:55:32] <CelioHogane> CANADA DLC
[3:55:32] <dukenux> Pat it's not Canada, there are more than just one road
[3:55:33] <%starotter70> Ok, so I've been gone, what the hell?
[3:55:33] <$velgaduere> Route 66 ain't SHIT compared to that road
[3:55:33] <%Explodincatz> but what if the snow melted and u made new roads
[3:55:33] <$PulverKong> why are your tyre rims glowing
[3:55:35] <+SickBangerzM9> somehow it would still be a construction racket
[3:55:35] <%dekkitout> Fix this one long road- IN THE WINTER
[3:55:37] <hawkofgp> also it wouldn't make sense because Canada already looks post-apocalyptic
[3:55:40] <Rich_In_Antioxidants> how does the skeleton not hurt Sam's back when he sits down in the truck?
[3:55:41] <+DesertPenguin> We have a lot of those, it's called an INTERSTATE
[3:55:42] <narusao> the rest of the time would be spent rebuilding the maple syrup factories
[3:55:45] <rumuloh> Strand means beach, yeah
[3:55:46] <SpaceGuntank> there is some sort of fun irony how a Canadian man is rebuilding the entirety of America's infrastructure.
[3:55:48] <dukenux> Yeah, i saw that SP episode LUL
[3:55:50] <Cdjgamer> pat be really canada doesnt rebuild anything
[3:55:55] <thetruthofyourbeing> sorrey

[3:56:02] <%chiluzza> america is DTF anytime BBY
[3:56:03] <+Daidis> ive considered moving to canada, its real easy for IT people
[3:56:03] <%Ranryu692> @AngriestPat we're the neighbor you steal cable from
[3:56:03] <$PulverKong> Oh look we've moved from grassy rocks to dirty rocks
[3:56:05] <+DesertPenguin> WE HAVE INTERSTATES. They go all the way East/West and North/South
[3:56:05] <+RAAAAAINMAKER> You're gonna have to drag material through a BT zone in 2 road sections
[3:56:05] <@commanderclaw> Also our idiot cousins
[3:56:06] <+Imn0tacop> Our highways were actually made intentionally confusing so the military could use them more sneaky beaky-like
[3:56:08] <worldbrand> why would anybody like america
[3:56:10] <elspiceweasel> thank you for keeping the polar bears out
[3:56:13] <Ipsenscastle> it's a trick
[3:56:14] <narusao> it... it's not like i like you or anything
[3:56:15] <%miguelrod777> not we like you ba-ba-baka
[3:56:15] <%trashcansan> i love you too, america's hat
[3:56:17] <sovayell> the game takes a sudden turn into Ice Road Truckers if you wanna go ballsy in the mountain
[3:56:18] <$ArtemisCroc> no america, you're OUR boxer-briefs
[3:56:19] <+dualviper25> trans canada makes me think of the anime where countries are anime characters and now im imagining him as a trans person
[3:56:20] <%Nobrev> I dont like America anymore :(
[3:56:21] <%dekkitout> America-Chan: Sh-shuddap, ba-bakanadian
[3:56:22] <%GeneralSCPatton> I've heard that Canada is our hat, and we are your pants
[3:56:22] <blaggablag> You just want to get into america's pants!
[3:56:26] <ScreamLord> @AngriestPat Which province would be fucked in Canada if this game was based in it? What's the Canadian equivalent to the Midwest?
[3:56:27] <%oktavia_von> i dont think montreal would want to join back with canada .
[3:56:27] <+keyoray> Paige America Blind?
[3:56:33] <+SickBangerzM9> you cant seduce america pat
[3:56:36] <%chaumiester> Remember that time when we friendly fired each other in WWII over some tiny island SW of Alaska? Good times
[3:56:39] <+DesertPenguin> @ScreamLord Calgary
[3:56:41] <thetruthofyourbeing> THE UK IS BOTH YOUR DADS
[3:56:41] <%PlainSimpleTailor> Mexico is our bluejeans
[3:56:47] <%Doomcoder> @SickBangerzM9 something something oil
[3:56:47] <%thenumber5point5> @angriestpat you makeing sure to litter as much as you can so other hard working porters can clean it up
[3:56:50] <$PulverKong> but baba IS you
[3:56:53] <+DesertPenguin> basically
[3:56:55] <$ArtemisCroc> ok boomer
[3:57:03] <Delenay> southern ontario is the major population area
[3:57:04] <steelmorrigan> The Uk is an asshole
[3:57:06] <+RAAAAAINMAKER> Now you can beat your Dad
[3:57:07] <ScreamLord> France too
[3:57:08] <+DesertPenguin> UK has way too many illegitimate kids lol
[3:57:08] <Rich_In_Antioxidants> Canada should just join America
[3:57:10] <%dekkitout> UK did not wear a rubber
[3:57:12] <SpaceGuntank> you can probably raid MULE camps for more mats if you run out but thats probably going to take a ton of time
[3:57:13] <@commanderclaw> We got a separation from the UK
[3:57:13] <dukenux> UK was basicly like Zeus
[3:57:14] <%xtremegamer80> The UK is a Madden
[3:57:14] <tyrano191> You steal our cable we steal your cartoons
[3:57:15] <%Engwithan_Elder_God> So like Zeus.
[3:57:15] <%trashcansan> uk confirmed for shit dad

[3:57:27] <superd4v3> @AngriestPat Kinda like Spain and South America LUL
[3:57:27] <thetruthofyourbeing> Is the uk a boomer?
[3:57:29] <RunningNGunning> UK stole other countries' kids and called them their own
[3:57:29] <dukenux> powerful, fuck around and left a ton of kids
[3:57:30] <AGRO_91> you deserved it USA
[3:57:31] <%trashcansan> uk has weak pull out game

[3:57:35] <%cureneckbeard> apatGib
[3:57:39] <+keyoray> Good BB
[3:57:39] <+Godjaw> Checked the last vod, no Mama, just the junkman and the artist
[3:57:42] <%dekkitout> And Australia is the bonker ass kid who went to jail and punches dangerous wildlife
[3:57:43] <$DarkKnightGrave> Lots of African Half-Brothers.
[3:57:50] <%GeneralSCPatton> Yeah, Australia is a little dysfunctional as a result, but it does its best and we're all very proud
[3:57:50] <%Nobrev> the UK is the DIO of nations
[3:57:51] <+SickBangerzM9> @AGRO_91 theres always one guy who gets mad when people talk about america
[3:57:51] <cheesedburgers> It would be horrible if it was even remotely accurate but it is a little funny how baby sized this America is, crossing the Midwest in like a couple minutes
[3:58:02] <elspiceweasel> spain was the racist old grandpa who gave you money
[3:58:05] <rumuloh> He literally met Mama last stream
[3:58:05] <+toolofparanoia> PEEPEE strikes again
[3:58:05] <SpaceGuntank> was that a fucking Watcher from Horizon?!?
[3:58:06] <beetbo2> The US said “OK Boomer” to the English
[3:58:08] <%Ranryu692> "They're all trying to kill me"
[3:58:13] <%thenumber5point5> I really wish those platforms had a larger "loading area"
[3:58:16] <worldbrand> i mean wildlife will punch you down there, so that's fair
[3:58:16] <@commanderclaw> New Zealand is the way too beautiful kid
[3:58:21] <blaggablag> Australia just kept chuggin beers and going BLOIMEY
[3:58:28] <%J_Papa> Definitely need more leeway with the parking distance to terminals
[3:58:29] <dukenux> wtf
[3:58:29] <+SickBangerzM9> australia is that kid who put traps in his room to deter his parents
[3:58:29] <ScreamLord> Australia did it while Drunk too
[3:58:31] <SpaceGuntank> it totally is!! holy shit!
[3:58:31] <%This_is_Marco> yea you gotta do that
[3:58:31] <$velgaduere> yeah but Australia's reformed now and stopped punching it because it started two separate wars with him
[3:58:33] <dukenux> is that a ghost raptor
[3:58:35] <sovayell> @AngriestPat did your previous death stranding stream vod go down?
[3:58:35] <%SlimeSlimeSlime> Australia = Jolyne Kujo because jail?
[3:58:36] <%trashcansan> is that a dino
[3:58:40] <AGRO_91> @SickBangerzM9 nah, just mad at all the "UK is a shit dad" LUL
[3:58:42] <%conradical> just park it a little higher on the stairs next time
[3:58:44] <+Mitchellsocks> What the hell is that robot dino?!
[3:58:44] <%Nobrev> look at that little HZD thing
[3:58:46] <Cdjgamer> feed it all to ghost raptorchan
[3:58:47] <%Laecerelius> I think that's one of those Horizon robo-dinos
[3:58:48] <+dualviper25> JUMP ON IT JUMP ON IT
[3:58:50] <+toolofparanoia> ROBOT DINOSAUR
[3:58:52] <Meta_Four> @Godjaw The actual last VOD isn't showing up for some people.
[3:58:54] <%linkster291> The Declaration of independence would of been a lot clearer if it just said "Ok Boomer".
[3:58:56] <King_Sear> YEAH ROBOT DINOSAUR
[3:58:56] <blaggablag> Just bonk it on the side, works every time
[3:58:57] <+starzo0> robo-dino riders incoming
[3:58:57] <Gruntini> It's always weird to me when European friends talk about taking a drive to the next country over
[3:58:59] <Calek> 800
[3:58:59] <elspiceweasel> aw man bears are probably extinct in this world
[3:58:59] <+Daidis> yo why is the speed limit in canada so fucking low
[3:59:00] <%Explodincatz> 800
[3:59:08] <%marsanta> 800
[3:59:09] <Angry_Ev1L> just go murder all the MULEs and take their metal

[3:59:16] <$antibonehurtingjuice> 800
[3:59:17] <%moondog_> goutrick do math
[3:59:18] <Delenay> the speed limit is like a wee bit lower then us
[3:59:20] <King_Sear> just wanted to be part of something...
[3:59:23] <%CrimsonCore90> To be truly american you need a drive through builder
[3:59:26] <+Daidis> interstate is 80 here
[3:59:26] <superd4v3> @Daidis Uh because it's in kilometers
[3:59:28] <+Daidis> 75 most places
[3:59:36] <Ipsenscastle> Pat you should probably get someone to check your work before setting out in future
[3:59:37] <+Daidis> 68 in canada
[3:59:40] <Delenay> 120 is just under 80 miles
[3:59:40] <hawkofgp> Can someone explain how it is possible for this single person to carry enough raw materials to build highways??
[3:59:42] <thetruthofyourbeing> deus
[3:59:45] <akita_opal> Boomer brain math
[3:59:48] <+Daidis> Isn't it 110 on the trans canada
[3:59:51] <+Mitchellsocks> What chapter of the story is this? I've missed part of this and the last stream, all I've seen is R O A D
[3:59:51] <%lotharrio> Did Pat just throw a punch?! That's not what this game is about.
[3:59:54] <King_Sear> Also, tomorrow is my first payday in more than half a year, so Imma re-up my subscription!
[3:59:56] <%J_Papa> Short parking distance to terminals, the BT scanner animation, and redundant menus are my 3 constant bugbears with this game
[3:59:56] <Ipsenscastle> @hawkofgp wizards
[4:00:02] <dukenux> @hawkofgp he drinks Monster(tm) Energy
[4:00:05] <Angry_Ev1L> @hawkofgp I can but why

[4:00:13] <hawkofgp> thanks guys
[4:00:15] <Monkeyweed21> check the postbox
[4:00:17] <$velgaduere> @hawkofgp superior loadbearing exoskeleton technology, good workout routine
[4:00:18] <Delenay> its what it says .... but you are allowed to fudge numbers and go like 20km more

[4:00:36] <+Daidis> 20? damn
[4:00:40] <dukenux> someone trashed their truc
[4:00:41] <%lotharrio> This game looks like all the stuff that, if it were in another game, would be the most hated shit. It's all about traversal and weight limits.
[4:00:42] <dukenux> oh
[4:00:42] <King_Sear> and your pleasure is our pleasure, honestly
[4:00:43] <ThatOneGuyYouSaw> are ya winnin, son?

[4:01:06] <dukenux> seriously what is that dino
[4:01:13] <Delenay> psh im doing 130 km most of the time
[4:01:13] <King_Sear> Is he ignoring it on purpose?!
[4:01:15] <$HyperionXV> Yeah some of the holograms are from Horizon Zero Dawn
[4:01:16] <Ipsenscastle> that vroom noise gets me every time. Reminds me of 2B's whistling butthole
[4:01:16] <King_Sear> reeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeee
[4:01:17] <sovayell> @lotharrio games like truck simulator and animal crossing are mad popular so im not sure thats true
[4:01:36] <$velgaduere> Elmo shit his mouth? D:
[4:01:37] <ScreamLord> @dukenux It's a robot from Horizone Zero Dawn
[4:01:37] <VritraReiRei> @dukenux It's a Watcher from Horizon Zero Dawn
[4:01:39] <thetruthofyourbeing> why IS the watchers from horizon in this game?
[4:01:42] <%UW_Duncan> I just got the urge to replay HZD now
[4:01:42] <%Zamorouskiwhich> apatCanada

[4:01:55] <dukenux> @ScreamLord @VritraReiRei thanks
[4:01:59] <steelmorrigan> There's a whole bunch of Horizon: Zero Dawn assets in this game
[4:01:59] <%lotharrio> @sovayell I meant, in a more "standard game." Like if this game included more shootouts or something.
[4:02:01] <waifoong98> bc game use same engine chat
[4:02:02] <%marvel877> @thetruthofyourbeing Game uses the same engine as Horizon
[4:02:09] <$velgaduere> @GarbageNirvana it's Strong Really Bad
[4:02:10] <IntrepidDolphin> could also go raid the MULES
[4:02:12] <dukenux> so are they like a pets or?
[4:02:13] <Ipsenscastle> @thetruthofyourbeing Kojima licensed Guerrilla's engine, they're friendly
[4:02:13] <thetruthofyourbeing> ah very cool
[4:02:16] <superd4v3> @thetruthofyourbeing Because Death Stranding and Horizon Zero Damn both use the same engine
[4:02:25] <ChrisM341> This game makes you feel like Forest gump
[4:02:28] <%Flambage> @AngriestPat Mug a Mule for metal
[4:02:29] <+dualviper25> i like to trip
[4:02:32] <VritraReiRei> @thetruthofyourbeing Horizon Zero Dawn used this game's engine. Kojima's logo is a collectible in that game
[4:02:37] <dukenux> not now Hillary
[4:02:40] <%J_Papa> Time for story... I remember saying that to myself many times
[4:02:41] <%marvel877> I just felt like runnin'.

[4:03:03] <Big_Dream> @AngriestPat death stranding is just mine craft 2.0
[4:03:04] <%Engwithan_Elder_God> Roads are sexy
[4:03:05] <sovayell> @lotharrio you're not wrong there, a game like this getting a AAA budget would never happen in any other timeline. its not focus-tested hard enough for the masses
[4:03:06] <+DesertPenguin> ughhh lol
[4:03:07] <%Strider222> that shelter has alot of likes
[4:03:08] <Asuxley> why didn't Kojima named her Dead Mom?

[4:05:05] <sovayell> whats the BIGGEST likes you guys seen so far in game? I saw a bridge with 310k
[4:05:25] <waifoong98> @All_Salt oh boi, can't wait for EVEN MORE BUGS
[4:05:26] <dukenux> ???
[4:05:27] <%J_Papa> I don't think any of my structures have more than 5k likes, what's the deal with 100k+? Is it a first come, first serve type deal?
[4:05:37] <Ipsenscastle> never stop never stopping
[4:05:46] <%SomeSageAdvice> oh that was from forever ago when Pat had the giant stack of cases on his back
[4:05:50] <sovayell> I wanna say its possibly streamers? and their fans are going out
[4:06:20] <ThatOneGuyYouSaw> what is the point of having a two lane road when only bikes are small enough to fit on each lane?
[4:06:23] <%cureneckbeard> MercyWing1 apatDab MercyWing2
[4:06:26] <%This_is_Marco> BB likes ziplines
[4:06:31] <All_Salt> @waifoong98 I can''t wait for The New War to come out after 10 years.
[4:06:34] <$PulverKong> God I hope he doesn't hit his legs on a big rock
[4:06:41] <ScreamLord> I love that If The Emperor Had A Text-To-Speech Device uses the Pillarmen theme for the Custodes
[4:06:43] <SpaceGuntank> weeeeee
[4:06:47] <%thenumber5point5> 23k worth of bandwidth of ziplines
[4:06:48] <+Darren716> Paige mic please
[4:06:56] <waifoong98> @All_Salt can't wait for "Coming this friday" delays by 10+ years
[4:06:57] <mayorrev> @AngriestPat paige your mic
[4:06:58] <+dualviper25> close to 20 of them and trhat was just whilke i was watching
[4:07:00] <%Engwithan_Elder_God> This is pretty sweet.
[4:07:08] <$PulverKong> Imagine slamming your knees into a rock like this
[4:07:09] <+SickBangerzM9> this seems overpowered
[4:07:27] <sovayell> waow pats just skipping the game Kappa
[4:07:28] <+NitronStreams> SPEEDRUN
[4:07:36] <%lotharrio> Pat using ziplines to make America cool again.
[4:07:38] <$PulverKong> speedrun strats
[4:07:45] <ThatOneGuyYouSaw> pay $60 and then skip the gameplay
[4:07:49] <+Darren716> I legit wonder what a speedrun of this game would even look like
[4:07:49] <dukenux> you broke the game
[4:07:56] <King_Sear> You could say, they're made of... STRANDS?!!!?!?!?
[4:07:57] <%CrimsonCore90> Pat is like a happy 5 year old!
[4:08:00] <+Daidis> a logistics simulator
[4:08:04] <Delenay> its not broken if its a mechanic
[4:08:07] <$PulverKong> @King_Sear no they're made of...DEATH
[4:08:09] <ChrisM341> So its Golf
[4:08:09] <waifoong98> MULEs is our resource slave and we steal from them Kappa
[4:08:09] <%Explodincatz> its about making it more efficient
[4:08:11] <blaggablag> But it's SUPER SATISFYING THO
[4:08:15] <+dualviper25> speedrun the game
[4:08:15] <thetruthofyourbeing> make the chemicals in your brain happy
[4:08:16] <dukenux> it makes sense if you have to still do a first trip
[4:08:18] <artoflec> thats why i watch instead of playing elaOk 👌
[4:08:19] <+SickBangerzM9> the game was designed to be a problem that you fix
[4:08:19] <%This_is_Marco> theres always a pee mushroom in their sleeping quarters
[4:08:21] <Psyramics> it feels really good to breeze through areas that gave you trouble before
[4:08:21] <tyrano191> Less cool now
[4:08:22] <%Black_Machete> I made a lot in the mountains and wasted a lot of bandwidth
[4:08:24] <Vaardvark> wait has Paige been talking? That mics volume is so low
[4:08:24] <+NitronStreams> imagine playing with out the spoiler filter and you literally ignore half of the game
[4:08:28] <NeroInfinite> the ziplines just destroy 90% of the provlems
[4:08:30] <%Finaldragoon> look at this crazy man playing the game like it was intended instead of baiting with awful clips for his "review"
[4:08:30] <blaggablag> It's like you get to suffer the inconvenience to then mitigate it
[4:08:34] <+G_Thunders> It’s more like rewarding preparation and creating routes
[4:08:35] <bleugh> nyannDab
[4:08:37] <+dualviper25> BYE BOOMER
[4:08:38] <dukenux> its like quick travel system that you build yourself
[4:08:41] <King_Sear> @PulverKong Is that Death... STRANDING?!?!!
[4:08:41] <superd4v3> @AngriestPat I'm pretty sure Kojima himself said that the best way to play this game is to avoid MULEs and BTs
[4:08:46] <Lelfro> you're making fast travel essentially
[4:08:49] <LORDSPOOKLEKINS> STRONG HANDCUFFS
[4:08:49] <42nfl19> You make a second trip..TO ESTABLISH DOMINANCE ON THE LAND!
[4:08:58] <+SickBangerzM9> he should hang by his leg
[4:08:58] <@commanderclaw> Muscles of the gods
[4:09:05] <%Doomcoder> @Godjaw found it, ***
[4:09:06] <Monkeyweed21> USE THE SPEEDBOOST
[4:09:06] <suikudo> that would rip his godamn arm off
[4:09:07] <%UW_Duncan> grip strength level maximum
[4:09:09] <NotHereToStream> maintenance is going to be shitty though, ziplines durability are bad compare to other structures
[4:09:09] <%J_Papa> Except Dragon's Dogma
[4:09:11] <SpaceGuntank> a speedrun of this game would be wild, it would probably be like in the 3-5+ hour catagory
[4:09:12] <+keyoray> XD
[4:09:12] <+8framelag> push the touchpad
[4:09:12] <+SickBangerzM9> are you kidding me? this looks super stupid
[4:09:12] <ThatOneGuyYouSaw> man, his jeerk off sessions must be intense
[4:09:14] <%Ner234> monkaS
[4:09:15] <$PulverKong> You can't really call every game that has fast travel "cheating"
[4:09:16] <+Reizie_Etherealm> Cuff link: It's like I'm carrying the weight of the world
[4:09:16] <%This_is_Marco> outa the way nerds
[4:09:16] <$ArtemisCroc> Yeah!

[4:09:36] <$PulverKong> Yeah I can imagine slamming your knees into that
[4:09:37] <+8framelag> i lost a bunch of likes when i slammed into those guys on a bike
[4:09:39] <+keyoray> ziplines need a warning system
[4:09:42] <dukenux> there should be "warning zipline" sign
[4:09:42] <%Ranryu692> DId you just steal that bike?
[4:09:44] <Rich_In_Antioxidants> what a strange thing to get paid in Likes. So if you have more likes does that make you more likely to trade with people?
[4:09:45] <+DesertPenguin> And that bike was just perfectly placed waitin for you lol
[4:09:50] <SpaceGuntank> building a teeny tiny road

[4:10:09] <%Engwithan_Elder_God> Those custom made tools were to make a child's toy, you monster.
[4:10:12] <%J_Papa> I love ziplines but i do wish there were a few limitations on them, like no high wind areas or something
[4:10:14] <%Ranryu692> nah you stole that from some poor schmuck
[4:10:18] <dukenux> just like planned
[4:10:19] <Enthaarungscreme> You'll be short that package
[4:10:21] <TheSandmanIsHere> how much road is left to build
[4:10:28] <$PulverKong> can the bike fall over?
[4:10:30] <%Alpha8087> Okay! Made it back. how goes it Pat.
[4:10:30] <%Keyd00d> A lot

[4:11:51] <Delenay> all that work for like 50'
[4:11:51] <$antibonehurtingjuice> pat just stop now there are like 12 roads to build in front of you
[4:11:52] <waifoong98> Here lies Pat's optimism and hopes LUL
[4:11:52] <%Alpha8087> You have to use your strand community to make the roads, which also look like strands on the map

[4:18:28] <Mister_McDerp> nonlethal? does it shoot rubber bullets?
[4:18:32] <red_blaster> I really like how this game gives you good updates every few hours.
[4:18:36] <%marvel877> Armor plating is fine, but it wastes a space on your suit for possible cargo.
[4:18:36] <Ipsenscastle> l i t e r a l l y
[4:18:40] <+DesertPenguin> @Mister_McDerp Probably yea
[4:18:40] <Jflaskd13> I like this guy

[4:18:56] <%J_Papa> It shoots Likes
[4:19:00] <$PulverKong> @Mister_McDerp shooting piss at humans would be non lethal
[4:19:01] <+SkaiVibration> injured huh?
[4:19:04] <TheSandmanIsHere> a Disco Elysium?
[4:19:06] <suikudo> an "accident"
[4:19:07] <SpaceGuntank> that was probably one of the most enthusiastic people in the game
[4:19:07] <TastySammiches> he talks but mostly to himself like a weirdo
[4:19:09] <+toolofparanoia> REEDUS DELETUS
[4:19:09] <leinadtonu> a disco accident
[4:19:12] <%joylent_blue> mostly he talks to himself
[4:19:14] <dukenux> @SickBangerzM9 he talks in grunts, like Tom Hardy in Fury Road
[4:19:15] <+keigatide> Man the fact that they're not actually speaking to you, it's not a conversation makes this feel really wooden
[4:19:17] <waifoong98> aw lame
[4:19:17] <spacegineer> trash
[4:19:18] <%oktavia_von> they partied to hard

[4:19:23] <%Thorlias> yeah pat, but the scanner isnt red!
[4:19:23] <+Reizie_Etherealm> Wait WAIT, does the armor imply that you're gonna be shot at?
[4:19:25] <fruit_pie_the_magician> Took a few too many disco biscuits in the heat of russian disputations
[4:19:27] <Ipsenscastle> the most crucial parts to protect with armour
[4:19:27] <waifoong98> insta trash LUL
[4:19:28] <$velgaduere> might as well delete it from the video game
[4:19:28] <TastySammiches> "weigh" the pros and cons haHAA
[4:19:28] <%Jack_of_No_Trades> Dress up as gundam
[4:19:30] <hawkofgp> @SickBangerzM9 he talks properly only in the story cut scenes I guess
[4:19:33] <%Doomcoder> I wanted to focus on the "rope" rather than the "stick." Collaboration rather than combat. Anyway, here's some armor and an assault rifle
[4:19:34] <LORDSPOOKLEKINS> Then throw it in the trash
[4:19:35] <+LtSergei> get them both pat
[4:19:36] <ThatOneGuyYouSaw> what's wrong with piss rounds?
[4:19:36] <+Reizie_Etherealm> I wish it was paint ball
[4:19:41] <+LtSergei> they're giving them to you for a reason
[4:19:45] <suikudo> you can still kill someone with rubber rounds btw
[4:19:51] <%lotharrio> Don't leave home without your rubbers.
[4:19:51] <+Reizie_Etherealm> Just play paint ball with the MULEs and have a good time
[4:19:55] <dukenux> i wish there were pepper spray rounds, like in SWAT
[4:20:01] <Akett> Rubber Elysium.
[4:20:01] <TheSandmanIsHere> under the distro ball duh
[4:20:03] <+RAAAAAINMAKER> The armour plating is for the new MULES you're about to face
[4:20:08] <%sporeian94> I just learned Mama actress played that underage hippie from Once Upon A Time In Hollywood whose feet were all over Brad Pitt's windshield
[4:20:08] <+keyoray> @Doomcoder America made him do it

[4:20:28] <%Doomcoder> @keyoray the first amendment is a helluva drug
[4:20:31] <KasiCrafter> @AngriestPat Maybe put a zipline anchor while you're up here?
[4:20:32] <dukenux> Disco tower is just this tall tower with a crystal ball on top

[4:20:49] <waifoong98> @J_Papa it's literally free real estate for resource LUL
[4:20:49] <%Rumbutt> it was 440
[4:20:54] <+toolofparanoia> Sam "Heart of America" Bridges
[4:20:57] <TheSandmanIsHere> so is this game actually fun?
[4:20:58] <+RAAAAAINMAKER> If you play on Hard you can't just take them on with plating
[4:20:59] <dukenux> @ClaudeMcGarren funny enough, it worked against masked thugs in SWAT4
[4:21:05] <+RAAAAAINMAKER> without*
[4:21:12] <%xtremegamer80> I think there was 40 ceramics on the ground
[4:21:14] <dukenux> i dont know if it was intentional or my game broke
[4:21:15] <+ClaudeMcGarren> @dukenux man swat was straight jank and i loved it lol
[4:21:27] <%Jack_of_No_Trades> I should build
[4:21:28] <%conradical> zipline up to the waystation pat
[4:21:30] <NotHereToStream> uh oh, zipline networking
[4:21:31] <%conradical> you know you want to
[4:21:33] <+Reizie_Etherealm> Anyone looking forward to Ready or Not?
[4:21:41] <+RAAAAAINMAKER> Oh fuck we've lost him to the ziplines
[4:21:42] <Delenay> to what?
[4:21:43] <spacegineer> Are the underground-dewllers incels? You keep delivering cum.
[4:21:53] <%conradical> connect the world through ziplines, pat
[4:21:54] <%J_Papa> @waifoong98 Yeah but i mean i like dodge countering and smashing faces with cargo
[4:21:55] <+Reizie_Etherealm> Ready or Not is a spiritual successor to SWAT 4
[4:21:58] <+ClaudeMcGarren> @Reizie_Etherealm ye was not much into swat seamed clunky even then to me but RON looks dpoe
[4:22:00] <suikudo> has he done any story since he said he was gonna?
[4:22:03] <+DesertPenguin> nope
[4:22:10] <waifoong98> @J_Papa oh yeah that's also really satisfying too
[4:22:11] <dukenux> RoN looked interesting but it was a bit quiet on that front
[4:22:14] <Calek> he's done a little story
[4:22:16] <King_Sear> I missed a significant portion of the stream, so I"m watching ahead of myself. I usually miss these, so normally I chip away at them over the course of the day. So I'll be going, then.
[4:22:19] <Calek> getting to the place he's at is part of it
[4:22:20] <King_Sear> peace, babies
[4:22:37] <+DesertPenguin> yea the place he's going to is story
[4:22:37] <+ClaudeMcGarren> no NL Rifle pat ?
[4:22:42] <+DesertPenguin> it's just taking some time and sidetrakcing
[4:22:44] <+Reizie_Etherealm> RON looks like insurgency gameplay mixed with SWAT mechanics it's great
[4:22:57] <%Doomcoder> ah yes the best line in the game
[4:22:59] <%This_is_Marco> cargo is non lethal Kappa
[4:23:05] <+RAAAAAINMAKER> I doubt we're gonna get to the chapter cutscene this stream, Zipline dick too good
[4:23:05] <purple_bagel> @claudemcgarren northernlion rifle
[4:23:07] <+toolofparanoia> When is Higg gonna appear again to non-consentually touch our butt?
[4:23:11] <Ipsenscastle> Norman even sounds like he's confused by the line he's reading
[4:23:13] <%This_is_Marco> no

[4:23:16] <%J_Papa> Porters

[4:23:23] <faldin> porters
[4:23:24] <ThatOneGuyYouSaw> GREATEST COURIER IN THE WORLD, SAM BRIDGES!
[4:23:24] <Shwepie> They know you'll run them over.
[4:23:25] <$antibonehurtingjuice> yes we will
[4:23:26] <R3c0n31> Well are they attacking you?
[4:23:26] <%lotharrio> Vroom-vroom
[4:23:27] <%sporeian94> and didn't leave them any likes
[4:23:28] <Calek> MULES have yellow letter cargo
[4:23:28] <dukenux> Your fellow Sam Porters
[4:23:29] <waifoong98> Pule Morters
[4:23:29] <%juxtest> Run them over just to be sure
[4:23:30] <%J_Papa> They're competition... take them out
[4:23:30] <transporterthesequel> Why...did their BT's go off?
[4:23:30] <SpaceGuntank> Yellow=Mules White=Porters
[4:23:36] <+DesertPenguin> Wait why is he going to The Craftsman again?
[4:23:36] <ChrisM341> NO ONE WILL EVER KNOW
[4:23:37] <transporterthesequel> BB's I mean?
[4:23:42] <+DesertPenguin> Or South Knot City?
[4:23:44] <%doc_ock_rokc> Kill them all patter! Let god sort it out
[4:23:51] <+DesertPenguin> I thought you were going up to the mountain
[4:23:56] <dukenux> Kill them and steal their cargo
[4:24:01] <+keyoray> Do it for the likes
[4:24:02] <%J_Papa> @transporterthesequel they get spooked easily, they chill out when you get close
[4:24:03] <transporterthesequel> Cause they certainly flashed yellow in Pat's direction
[4:24:04] <%This_is_Marco> @transporterthesequel you rush up to they it scares them so they scan
[4:24:08] <%Doomcoder> High Risk, High Reward
[4:24:10] <+8framelag> 50 hit that jump
[4:24:14] <transporterthesequel> Ah, thanks!
[4:24:17] <TastySammiches> smash that mf like button
[4:24:33] <red_blaster> The mule camps near the engineer have tons of metal and ceramics.
[4:24:35] <Zaphire_Saucypants> Whoa, when did Pat start?
[4:24:35] <Kalinflip> Go pat just run awa from your demons
[4:24:44] <+DesertPenguin> !uptime
[4:24:45] <@Moobot> I've been playing this game for how long? Oh only 4h 24m.
[4:24:48] <SpaceGuntank> inb4 he crashes and eats shit on the rocks
[4:24:48] <+Promessa_EX> wow that was very skulls
[4:24:57] <Kalinflip> Nice moves pat
[4:24:58] <hcsarg1986> Are you going to play more of Fallen Order?
[4:25:02] <waifoong98> neat
[4:25:04] <Zaphire_Saucypants> Well shit.
[4:25:04] <+RAAAAAINMAKER> like the bridge
[4:25:05] <%sporeian94> So honest question. Do you think Kojima's next game will be like this or is he gonna maybe try to make a more conventional game within a specific genre?
[4:25:06] <CelioHogane> @hcsarg1986 no
[4:25:11] <Kalinflip> nah
[4:25:20] <+Daidis> i want to see a kojima rpg
[4:25:21] <Kalinflip> kojima is making porn now atpCap
[4:25:24] <+SickBangerzM9> @sporeian94 i hope. i prefer his linear games
[4:25:25] <LunarRemix> I think he's going to double down
[4:25:26] <TheSandmanIsHere> @sporeian94 adventure game, maximum cutscenes
[4:25:29] <dukenux> next Kojima profect will be a full movie
[4:25:30] <+Promessa_EX> maybe a strands type game in a diff genre
[4:25:33] <+DesertPenguin> You're going the wrong way
[4:25:35] <TastySammiches> kojima wants to make movies now
[4:25:37] <+2DSuperiority> Death Stranding Survive
[4:25:38] <Rich_In_Antioxidants> after the shit with PT I know what he's definitely not gonna make. A horror game
[4:25:39] <hcsarg1986> @CelioHogane Did he find it boring?
[4:25:43] <+SickBangerzM9> kojima finally made it to hollywood i think
[4:25:48] <%J_Papa> Anyone think we'll see Pat cause a void-out? I doubt it, he's careful and the game is pretty easy
[4:25:51] <+SickBangerzM9> hes gonna start making movies
[4:25:51] <+RAAAAAINMAKER> Death Stranding 2 LUL
[4:25:52] <ChrisM341> Hideo Kojima Presents: The Room
[4:25:52] <%xtremegamer80> ZIPLINE
[4:25:55] <%Doomcoder> Death Stranding: Battle Royale
[4:25:56] <LunarRemix> He's going to make a FPS only to switch genre midway as a fuck you for liking violence
[4:25:59] <spacegineer> No to both. He will try to make one of those *** you find on dvd-menus, and then call you stupid when you complain about hte controls.
[4:26:01] <thetruthofyourbeing> kojima porn. 9 hours of plot and no fucking
[4:26:11] <CelioHogane> @hcsarg1986 no, he just decided to focus on other games (DEATH STRANDING), i think he played it offstream
[4:26:17] <hawkofgp> @sporeian94 It seems to me that his games are likely to have this kind of 3rd person "action" basis but who knows. The Silent Hill game was going to be way different
[4:26:18] <%Doomcoder> and all the female characters are weirdly representative of motherhood
[4:26:20] <$Yakobro> LUL
[4:26:22] <%Laecerelius> fucking nothing!
[4:26:22] <%Explodincatz> perfect
[4:26:24] <waifoong98> Jebaited
[4:26:33] <Sykotix> nice
[4:26:33] <OmegaDeku> N o t h i n g
[4:26:41] <TastySammiches> sorry nothing
[4:26:41] <+D00msDayDan> @AngriestPat bridge link with other people's ziplines so you have a higher chance of seeing them
[4:26:48] <%thenumber5point5> only random stuff goes to other people's games so you find a lot of lone ziplines
[4:26:56] <+RAAAAAINMAKER> It gets weird whenever a women appears in a Kojima game
[4:26:58] <All_Salt> I think in my game it was a zip to the middle of the crater town
[4:27:01] <hcsarg1986> @CelioHogane Does he at least plan on talking about what he thought about it?
[4:27:13] <CelioHogane> @hcsarg1986 he did on the last podcast
[4:27:17] <%SlimeSlimeSlime> Isn't it weird how there's no trees or lush forests anywhere?
[4:27:27] <purple_bagel> Therr are
[4:27:32] <%doc_ock_rokc> @SlimeSlimeSlime that is because timefall
[4:27:35] <rumuloh> There is a forest in the first area
[4:27:39] <hcsarg1986> @CelioHogane Channel Name Please
[4:27:40] <TheSandmanIsHere> @slimeslimeslime everywhere is Iceland now, so...
[4:27:42] <+RAAAAAINMAKER> Pat built a bridge over the BT forrest
[4:27:42] <+VideoGameTim_> there are a few forests
[4:27:42] <Zaphire_Saucypants> Hey @angriestpat just so ya know, if you don’t already, you’ll REALLY want to do all the pizza deliveries on stream.
[4:27:44] <%J_Papa> Trees are in the first map
[4:27:45] <dukenux> There was a forest at the beginning of the game
[4:27:51] <ChrisM341> Here's an idea, I want Kojima's first movie to be called BT's and to be a horror short cgi based around this game and Sam's nightmares but with the same energy as Silent Hill PT
[4:27:51] <dukenux> but people built a bridge over it
[4:27:58] <TastySammiches> mmm pizza time
[4:27:58] <+SickBangerzM9> wouldnt this place be full of trees because timefall accelerates tree growth?
[4:28:00] <%skibadaa> @AngriestPat You should grab the ceramics from the private room near craftsman for the next road on the way back
[4:28:00] <%Divryne> HAHA SECOND ONE.
[4:28:03] <+D00msDayDan> the third one's a doozy
[4:28:05] <Monkeyweed21> the payoff is amazing
[4:28:07] <waifoong98> did the guy send new mail fr the 2nd time?
[4:28:10] <Angry_Ev1L> JUST DO THEM ON STREAM and don;t ask questions
[4:28:11] <+keyoray> @SlimeSlimeSlime More than that, where is all the grass? Or weeds in general.
[4:28:11] <%Doomcoder> Peached Things
[4:28:14] <%Divryne> You'll love the third one.
[4:28:19] <Zaphire_Saucypants> You have to do them all
[4:28:21] <%valriot> Where do you even get the third one?
[4:28:21] <%J_Papa> Trees live a long time, it would make sense for some to be around
[4:28:22] <+8framelag> 10mins or it's free
[4:28:23] <Zaphire_Saucypants> Big spoilers
[4:28:30] <%Tucker0603> so when was Pat thinking to get to story? 12?
[4:28:31] <SpaceGuntank> 3
[4:28:32] <%SlimeSlimeSlime> @keyoray True, you'd expect timefall to make forests pop up all over.
[4:28:33] <+SickBangerzM9> ONE GUY
[4:28:36] <BurningLlama777> I like how these road builders go "nyuck nyuck" when you go up to them.
[4:28:39] <RitzySummers> Hey there

[4:36:04] <sirrice77> yup
[4:36:06] <%valriot> @angriestpat 2 headshots is a knock out
[4:36:07] <%Laecerelius> Just kill them all and then when they all turn into ghosts kill their ghosts with your blood for chiral crystals
[4:36:07] <%Divryne> Two shot headshots.
[4:36:07] <%Meow0369> I'd say that if you can aim well a bola lvl 2 is better
[4:36:10] <%deviljhojho_> Norman Osborn and the Fetus of God
[4:36:11] <%Flambage> Show them your new GUN @AngriestPat
[4:36:11] <+8framelag> bola > rifle
[4:36:15] <%supersugoisenpai1> All the fun of shooting people without the death
[4:36:15] <Zaphire_Saucypants> It is
[4:36:19] <tyrano191> Yes very effective
[4:36:19] <+DesertPenguin> Why not use the lethal bullets and kill them for real?
[4:36:20] <+G_Thunders> I carried one on me the rest of the game
[4:36:20] <leinadtonu> I prefer the bola.
[4:36:21] <Shwepie> Is it better than bola though?
[4:36:21] <Zaphire_Saucypants> I like it
[4:36:22] <thetruthofyourbeing> finally. GUN
[4:36:26] <waifoong98> now time for BIG ROADS
[4:36:27] <Bluewolf544> @angriestpat Better get used to it now
[4:36:27] <dukenux> Norman Osborn and the Funky Formula
[4:36:27] <+Ryu_R> dickshots also knock out
[4:36:27] <+SickBangerzM9> @DesertPenguin voidouts
[4:36:27] <ThDark> @Manwad Bola is only a temp stun, they can get back up later, knocking them out with the gun is much better
[4:36:32] <+Promessa_EX> killing is bad and not very strandy
[4:36:32] <%GeneralSCPatton> Cheer1000 To clarify, there are creatures on the southern tip of the timefall farm peninsula, on the beach. So far, there is no precedent in the lore for what the fuck they could be. Perfect little mystery to end or start the stream on.
[4:36:36] <%Black_Machete> not in harder difficulty I find the bola better
[4:36:36] <%thenumber5point5> honestly perfered the bola gun over it untill better weapons later
[4:36:38] <%joylent_blue> but what about ebola gun pvpWhy
[4:36:45] <%This_is_Marco> non-lethal grenades Kappa
[4:36:46] <tyrano191> Lv2 better though
[4:36:47] <FirearmsInstructor> @AngriestPat Did someone say GUN? :D ^_~
[4:36:50] <+DesertPenguin> @SickBangerzM9 oh yea, you don't want dead things
[4:36:51] <%J_Papa> Well you can headshot with the bolas the knock them out in one shot
[4:36:54] <dukenux> Non-lethal nukes
[4:36:58] <+RAAAAAINMAKER> one of the orders is fetch a fuckton of ceramics 500 metres away
[4:37:03] <%SlimeSlimeSlime> Ah yes, the STD truck.
[4:37:04] <Rich_In_Antioxidants> Just kick their balls in enough time until they can be legally called children again
[4:37:12] <+DesertPenguin> SDT
[4:37:17] <%SlimeSlimeSlime> Close enough
[4:37:21] <blaggablag> That's not the truckload of cum I was looking for
[4:37:22] <Monkeyweed21> you have materials in your locker too
[4:37:24] <tmix1600> Does driving into mules kill or knockout?
[4:37:29] <+SickBangerzM9> just use your tranq gun bro 4Head
[4:37:30] <%Meow0369> Moreeeee

[4:38:08] <+8framelag> Here's the BIG ONE
[4:38:09] <%SlimeSlimeSlime> sexually diseased transmissions
[4:38:10] <Rich_In_Antioxidants> so when do you use your semen to kill ghosts?

[4:38:15] <%Meow0369> Pat's chat stand is one guy
[4:38:18] <+LtSergei> I LOVE THAT
[4:38:19] <%joylent_blue> LUL
[4:38:19] <%Ranryu692> 『Bigmouth Strikes Again』
[4:38:19] <ChrisM341> @generalscpatton YES
[4:38:20] <%Valdorick> That's strong, that's strong.
[4:38:22] <%Doomcoder> canon
[4:38:24] <lyzejag> KEEP ON KEEPING ON
[4:38:24] <dukenux> Enemy STRAND?
[4:38:24] <%Tucker0603> PERFECT
[4:38:24] <ScreamLord> @AngriestPat It baffles me that people are still making lethal weapon in a world where corpses explode like nukes
[4:38:29] <ThatOneGuyYouSaw> whose giving bad advice?
[4:38:31] <+SickBangerzM9> perhaps this is Crazy Talk Requiem?
[4:38:36] <+SickBangerzM9> given autonomy
[4:38:37] <%Meow0369> I prefer One Guy as the chats stand
[4:38:38] <Storm_Samurai> Wow that's a good Stand name
[4:38:42] <%Doomcoder> gotta be a song
[4:38:44] <+DesertPenguin> I don't watch JoJo but I noticed Giorno's Theme popping up everywhere on YouTube. Can someone please explain what that's about?
[4:38:46] <yojohny> NORMAL LUL
[4:38:50] <%lotharrio> My Stand... "No Cats in America."
[4:38:52] <%This_is_Marco> I wish
[4:38:53] <TheSandmanIsHere> Chat's Stand name: This Probably Won't End Well
[4:38:54] <popcultureaficionado> Game must be trivial with the truce right?
[4:38:54] <+8framelag> and yet the mules use lethal weapons...
[4:38:55] <%joylent_blue> One-guyman and his stand 『Bigmouth Strikes Again』
[4:38:55] <blaggablag> That's what you get if you get stabbed by a Chiral arrow
[4:38:57] <Fujiwara_92> One Guy is a better name
[4:38:57] <Bluewolf544> Stand user : Chat, Stand name [ONE GUY]
[4:39:01] <%psydaku> why not smash mouth?
[4:39:02] <Guardiansaiyan> @ScreamLord there are always people who want to do big combo in a big number world
[4:39:03] <+SickBangerzM9> @DesertPenguin good song and a sign that you're about to get your ass kicked
[4:39:04] <reonome> thats right jay
[4:39:05] <RitzySummers> Do you like the game so far?
[4:39:13] <%valriot> That's right Jay!
[4:39:14] <Kalinflip> Turn it off in the playstation menu
[4:39:16] <%Meow0369> One Guy stand power activates again
[4:39:21] <lyzejag> Really ?
[4:39:22] <Storm_Samurai> @Doomcoder Artist: The Smiths Album: Bigmouth Strikes Again Released: 1986 Genre: Alternative/Indie
[4:39:24] <+Ominnous> Pat: "that's a bit paranoid"
[4:39:25] <%joylent_blue> pat really likes the game
[4:39:25] <+V0idWaIker> @screamlord It baffles me that people are still building nukes when nukes explode like nukes
[4:39:26] <%Meow0369> Don't -_-
[4:39:26] <Kalinflip> in controllers
[4:39:27] <%Ranryu692> 『Bigmouth Strikes Again』
[4:39:28] <+DesertPenguin> @SickBangerzM9 is it a new song like it just debuted in an episode recently or it's been around for awhile in games and it just got big for some reason?
[4:39:29] <FalseEyeD> Yep
[4:39:30] <ChrisM341> A good stand name: Beats in my head.
[4:39:32] <+Promessa_EX> these controllers can rumble for years
[4:39:32] <Rich_In_Antioxidants> Death Stranding reminds me of an episode of Star Trek
[4:39:38] <%This_is_Marco> PogChamp this is useful
[4:39:39] <%Doomcoder> @Storm_Samurai ye, was in response to "just call it One Guy"
[4:39:42] <ChrisM341> The user hears their own battle theme
[4:39:42] <+RAAAAAINMAKER> don't turn rumble off
[4:39:42] <Monkeyweed21> its FIIIINE
[4:39:42] <Kalinflip> go to the setttings
[4:39:43] <popcultureaficionado> the chat lies
[4:39:45] <dukenux> [One Guy]'s ability is to convince any person of whatever lie he's telling, no matter how untrue it is, and do their biding
[4:39:46] <+dualviper25> hold ps button

[4:39:56] <thetruthofyourbeing> settings brah
[4:39:57] <%J_Papa> I love it when my favorite personalities overlap, everyone here loves RedLetterMedia too

[4:40:15] <lyzejag> Ye
[4:40:16] <TheSandmanIsHere> Chat Stand Name: Couch Potato
[4:40:17] <+DesertPenguin> rumble isn't gonna kill a controller that person is worrying too much
[4:40:17] <+GrokivB> the only rumble i've ever seen die has been crappy mad catz controllers
[4:40:19] <%GeneralSCPatton> I don't think anyone can kill the rumble without aggressive female masturbation.
[4:40:24] <ThatOneGuyYouSaw> k
[4:40:24] <+dualviper25> RIP CONTROLLER
[4:40:31] <%joylent_blue> Mendin ye he started early today
[4:40:33] <%Meow0369> I haven't seen the creatures, maybe I'll go check em out
[4:40:35] <%Doomcoder> "lore"
[4:40:37] <%BallerSwagBro9k> @mendin He starts at 3pm now
[4:40:40] <VritraReiRei> @AngriestPat On your PS4 go to Settings > Devices > Controllers > Enable Vibration then uncheck the box and vibration will be turned off.
[4:40:45] <TheSandmanIsHere> @generalscpatton that's what the Rez Trance Vibrator was for right?
[4:40:46] <Kalinflip> ^^^
[4:40:53] <%GeneralSCPatton> Somewhere around there
[4:40:54] <%thenumber5point5> behind pizza bunker
[4:40:58] <startstoprepeat> if it's what i think it is, there's some up north near the crater too
[4:41:00] <%Meow0369> You called?
[4:41:09] <Mendin> @BallerSwagBro9k Only on saturdays I thouuught jesus. Did I miss any plot-lore or has it just been side deliveries, roads, and ziplines?
[4:41:11] <waifoong98> @Meow0369 lol
[4:41:14] <Rich_In_Antioxidants> imagine death stranding but instead of a BB it's Neelix
[4:41:24] <+DesertPenguin> good timing @Meow0369
[4:41:30] <%Doomcoder> and instead of the Stranding, it's The Chill
[4:41:31] <TheSandmanIsHere> @rich_in_antioxidants why
[4:41:35] <thetruthofyourbeing> one trick
[4:41:37] <rumuloh> They should have gotten Danny DeVito to play BB in this game
[4:41:38] <%joylent_blue> Mendin there was gonna be story but then he accidentally spent 4 hours building ziplines
[4:41:38] <$ArtemisCroc> @Rich_In_Antioxidants and Sam is Tuvoc
[4:41:38] <%Jack_of_No_Trades> Roads > ghosts
[4:41:39] <+keyoray> 3
[4:41:40] <+SickBangerzM9> in the pc version someone should make a mod where elmo is bb and pat is reedus
[4:41:40] <%karl_rex> Ghosts HATE roads
[4:41:42] <ChrisM341> Ghostly Roads
[4:41:42] <CurrySauseBandit> LUL
[4:41:43] <Monkeyweed21> beat those ghosts like a spouse in Fortnite
[4:41:43] <%SlimeSlimeSlime> Except for the hit and run ghosts, they know all too well.
[4:41:45] <HoldBtoRun> eyes on the road son LUL
[4:41:45] <%lotharrio> Ghosts suck against roads, like vampires suck against houses.
[4:41:46] <spacegineer> EYES --> ROAD
[4:41:47] <Psyramics> no distracted driving!
[4:41:47] <Rich_In_Antioxidants> @ArtemisCroc HAHAHAHA
[4:41:47] <TheSandmanIsHere> roads>Pat
[4:41:48] <Kalinflip> @Rich_In_Antioxidants Imagine if instead of BTS its just ghostly visions of these nuts :)
[4:41:49] <lyzejag> 3
[4:41:51] <waifoong98> But Ghostrider Kappa
[4:41:51] <%thenumber5point5> Ghost car stand?
[4:41:53] <@commanderclaw> Cat causes man to void out entire nation
[4:41:58] <+DesertPenguin> If you could sum up the plot that you've experienced so far today, how would you?
[4:41:58] <+machshop> ghosts can't even comprehend roads
[4:42:03] <%Meow0369> I once looked away for about a third of a second and when I looked back my bike had gone off a ledge and fucked everything I carried
[4:42:08] <%Doomcoder> there is that one dream where BB gets Guillermo's face, so I hope a mod could make that its permanent appearance
[4:42:10] <%Alpha8087> Now you must finght this games Road Ghost boss, DOOMStrain
[4:42:11] <%J_Papa> It sucks to see someone else's name on the road you built
[4:42:13] <waifoong98> ohhh free ceramic
[4:42:14] <lyzejag> left
[4:42:15] <rumuloh> @DesertPenguin "none"
[4:42:15] <%Meow0369> it's safe directly ahead
[4:42:18] <%Valdorick> The BTs hate roads, because the roads were made with the blood, sweat, and tears of americans, and they HATE body fluids.
[4:42:19] <%GeneralSCPatton> @desertpenguin ROADS AND ZIPLINES... MAN
[4:42:20] <+RAAAAAINMAKER> the one by the bridge
[4:42:21] <lyzejag> it's around the river
[4:42:23] <faldin> healer instant queues are great
[4:42:24] <%Meow0369> The BTs shouldn't attack you at the servo thing
[4:42:28] <+SickBangerzM9> wow this looks like it gets annoying
[4:42:38] <+SickBangerzM9> masking a loading screen probably
[4:42:39] <Fujiwara_92> Zip Lines beat Roads and Roads beat Ghosts
[4:42:45] <%Doomcoder> @DesertPenguin "Wheeeeeeee"
[4:42:54] <+WhackyChiraqi> just tuning in where is he at in the story chat
[4:42:55] <FalseEyeD> Was that screen tear?
[4:42:57] <%J_Papa> The game proves later that it's not a loading screen
[4:42:58] <+WhackyChiraqi> gotta know what to be able to talk about
[4:43:03] <+RAAAAAINMAKER> this is the road section the btpasses the bts so its super useful
[4:43:09] <BurningLlama777> This game makes me appreciate bridges a lot.
[4:43:12] <+keyoray> @Valdorick i like your head canon, its true now
[4:43:22] <+DesertPenguin> @Doomcoder lol
[4:43:23] <spacegineer> Man, your ride is rusty as shit
[4:43:27] <+SickBangerzM9> what happens if you put your truck in the path of the road thats being built?
[4:43:36] <%Meow0369> By the way every time you take this road it'll do the scream noise, and stop your car completely 2 times, it's the worst thing ever. Every Single Fucking Time
[4:43:38] <lyzejag> I remember the first days into the game how nobody would even try to builds those roads
[4:43:39] <+WhackyChiraqi> @SickBangerzM9 it just moves a little
[4:43:40] <%J_Papa> It just ends up on top of the road
[4:43:46] <+RAAAAAINMAKER> this is a good road here
[4:43:48] <+Reizie_Etherealm> Nerdman Reedus
[4:43:53] <%cureneckbeard> just throw poo at all the ghosts
[4:43:54] <BurningLlama777> Infrastructure is really important. Putting Norman Reedus into the infrastructure game made me really stop and look at what was happening.
[4:43:56] <+WhackyChiraqi> Neeman Roadus
[4:44:03] <%SlimeSlimeSlime> On the Road Again
[4:44:04] <kehnimentu> PrimeYouDontSay
[4:44:04] <rumuloh> Roadman Roadus
[4:44:05] <BurningLlama777> That takes amazing talent.
[4:44:05] <popcultureaficionado> Oh shit I see he found Conan
[4:44:20] <%joylent_blue> i hope Sam got his tetanus shot
[4:44:23] <waifoong98> Road Stranding >>> Bridge Stranding
[4:44:29] <+machshop> he found conan and adam jensen
[4:44:30] <+SickBangerzM9> Pat why isnt DMC5 your goty?
[4:44:32] <Rich_In_Antioxidants> jerk off on all the ghosts until they're like ew you baka
[4:44:36] <spacegineer> Where will this road lead to?
[4:44:36] <%Alpha8087> I wonder if you can screw Amrica over in thsi game by not delivering shit and deleting structures
[4:44:49] <+WhackyChiraqi> CHAT: what story mission is he on?
[4:44:52] <%Meow0369> Generator pat
[4:44:54] <%Doomcoder> 5
[4:44:56] <$HyperionXV> deleting other people's stuff only removes it from your game
[4:45:00] <Delenay> get to the mountain town
[4:45:03] <djFishmonger> So, if Sam actually gets caught by a BT does it actually leave a crater?
[4:45:03] <%Meow0369> 800
[4:45:05] <@StridentSong> @alpha8087 Deleting structures only applies to your world
[4:45:05] <blackesteagle> @spacegineer Rome ofc
[4:45:07] <BurningLlama777> If you only got a couple drops of timefall on your hair, you'd still be okay, right?
[4:45:11] <Delenay> but that means pave the way
[4:45:18] <+RAAAAAINMAKER> road goes to the distribution center and then to mountain knot city
[4:45:19] <Zaphire_Saucypants> The last few roads are fucked. Takes SO many resources.
[4:45:20] <%cureneckbeard> yeah pat got caught off-stream and crater
[4:45:20] <%Doomcoder> @djFishmonger yes. not a huge one though
[4:45:21] <%Alpha8087> Yeah I didnt mean others, just like your own save and game haha
[4:45:27] <Scrub_Seeker> @djFishmonger yes, voidouts are a mechanic
[4:45:28] <CurrySauseBandit> Just realized. Is their mist from his breathe cause it's cold or cause there are ghost around?
[4:45:29] <Kalinflip> @Zaphire_Saucypants Legit
[4:45:32] <Dutchpotato> If u get eaten yes it leaves a crater
[4:45:36] <%Alpha8087> Just become enemy of the country Reedus
[4:45:40] <djFishmonger> @Doomcoder That's good, thought they left it out.
[4:45:40] <%cureneckbeard> if you shoot mules will they become crater

[4:46:18] <bleugh> nyannDab
[4:46:19] <Mister_McDerp> its true, I wear glasses and I am a nerd
[4:46:21] <Verriand> Kojima sees Reedus as the rough, USA version of himself. thats why they're BFFS. Also, half the chat told you this and hour ago
[4:46:21] <%sporeian94> Why did Kojima change glasses type. He had those sleek cool looking ones and now he wears these circular bubbles looking ones
[4:46:21] <%MoraMiarty> I hate how bad he is at that
[4:46:24] <+RAAAAAINMAKER> chat is taller than you
[4:46:25] <%BallerSwagBro9k> Twist: Norman and Reedus are ONE AND THE SAME
[4:46:26] <PkSilent01> Can’t believe you said the N word

[4:46:39] <%Tucker0603> nah ya just a stumbo
[4:46:47] <mayorrev> @AngriestPat you should play fortnite so you can do that dance properly
[4:46:53] <%Meow0369> Pat's a geek
[4:46:56] <lyzejag> @AngriestPat Btw the limits on the truck is the weigth not numbers of cargo in it and also is around 2000 kilos
[4:46:58] <KaijuVania> does kojima have a cameo in the game?
[4:46:59] <%Alpha8087> A Chiral Nerd
[4:47:01] <%SlimeSlimeSlime> That car is rusted all to hell.
[4:47:01] <%xtremegamer80> Does anyone else get uncomfortable about bodies? Not like your body, but like the anatomy of bodies.
[4:47:01] <%WhackyChiraqi> they're full of blood since that's where it's made at
[4:47:01] <%karl_rex> You don't have a skeleton inside you, You're inside your skeleton
[4:47:03] <mayorrev> do it tho
[4:47:06] <mayorrev> Kappa
[4:47:09] <%ryome> You fucked up by calling out his badness
[4:47:11] <%WhackyChiraqi> it also gives it somewhat bendy properties
[4:47:11] <+DesertPenguin> These roads are nice and all but in some areas it doesn't even look that necessary and a bit of off-roading is fun in my mind
[4:47:13] <+SickBangerzM9> skeletons arent real tho
[4:47:13] <%Centrilion> Centrilion subscribed with Twitch Prime. They've subscribed for 8 months! This game is so oddly fun, I can't stop playing it.

[4:47:28] <%sporeian94> Time to go grinding BTs
[4:47:29] <%Jack_of_No_Trades> That truck is going to fall apart like the Blues Brothers car in a few more road sections
[4:47:31] <%Doomcoder> @KaijuVania he emerged from the floor as a tar ghost and tried to pull Sam into hell, but it was only a dream

[4:50:08] <waifoong98> come on give him likes
[4:50:08] <+DesertPenguin> Can the truck fall apart so much that wheels fall off?
[4:50:09] <Ion_Laser> @Rich_In_Antioxidants A HD version of the RE1 remake was released on the PS4 in 2015

[4:54:24] <%Jack_of_No_Trades> Is this your new record for amount of roads per stream?

[4:59:30] <EuropanLamprey> Building roads is the ultimate littering if you think about it
[4:59:31] <BurningLlama777> Actually... do you think the game would actually let you kill MULES, throw them on a truck and bring them back to the incinerator?

[5:01:19] <%Black_Machete> Hey pat did you know sam can double jump when he has little to no weight
[5:01:19] <BurningLlama777> You'd think they'd put a big ol' plastic tarp over this outdoor area.

[5:02:11] <@Moobot> I've been playing this game for how long? Oh only 5h 2m.
[5:02:13] <BurningLlama777> RoadMaster gets his proper roads!
[5:02:13] <%J_Papa> I saw you get 11k likes in the first or second stream
[5:02:14] <dmysta3000> Roads for the Road God
[5:02:16] <Lelfro> Boiman

[5:02:22] <%doc_ock_rokc> @SlimeSlimeSlime so like most of our infustructure
[5:02:22] <@commanderclaw> Pat the Roadway Baron
[5:02:23] <%marvel877> KONAMI owns the Fox Engine...
[5:02:29] <agumon9000> @AngriestPat Did you know? Building a massive series of ziplines takes less materials than roads, are safer than roads, and faster than roads?
[5:02:29] <mayorrev> ohhhh
[5:02:30] <cherrycottontail> yeah but story
[5:02:30] <%SlimeSlimeSlime> @doc_ock_rokc Oh ho~
[5:02:31] <%cureneckbeard> Thanks, Fox engine.
[5:02:33] <%DedlokPM> @mayorrev it's using Decima Engine from Sony.
[5:02:34] <%Alpha8087> Patrick, more like Patroad, gottem
[5:02:35] <%juxtest> His name should be Sam Infrastructure Engineer Bridges
[5:02:36] <+creamandsugar> they seem me roadin
[5:02:36] <Goergorion> big roads amn
[5:02:38] <%honeyman18> Jesus, God this stream is still going?
[5:02:38] <%Soulbishop> @AngriestPat how many monsters have you had. . . I thought you were sleepy and low energy today
[5:02:39] <BurningLlama777> More like Patrick Droivin
[5:02:40] <Daxalog> Imagine if you had to get 10k likes to get the secret ending.
[5:02:40] <%Ner234> Pat's dick is SO huge right now.
[5:02:42] <Dakuu75> he's been streaming for 5-fucking-hours. damn... and I was wasting time at work
[5:02:42] <mayorrev> I barely noticed
[5:02:43] <+marazemoph> Road squadron
[5:02:47] <%deviljhojho_> i feel like i'm becoming a bot the more pat streams deaths stranding. I just type stupid catchphrases from the game into chat
[5:02:49] <%Doomcoder> @agumon9000 but no trucks tho
[5:02:52] <+NitronStreams> Pat, Paver of the Midwest
[5:02:55] <blackesteagle> but anyone jealous of your ROD?
[5:02:58] <mayorrev> reminds me a lot of MGSV
[5:02:58] <Cymen90> Literally rebuilding America USING THE SOULS OF THE DEAD
[5:02:58] <%joylent_blue> but the ROADSSSSS
[5:03:01] <spacegineer> This game is just sim city!
[5:03:02] <+RAAAAAINMAKER> Hahahahaha
[5:03:03] <NotHereToStream> yo, what about ziplines
[5:03:03] <Kalinflip> did you know the S in stranding stands for STRAND?
[5:03:04] <Maverick2736> jumping over those tubes should NOT be that easy
[5:03:04] <Kale_Chip> and its still comfy watching you do that
[5:03:05] <%cureneckbeard> But Pat, Dunkey rated this game 1/5. You aren't allowed to like it.
[5:03:07] <%deviljhojho_> Almost as stupid as Ride with Norman Reedus on AMC, even. Go watch it
[5:03:07] <+RAAAAAINMAKER> Sure
[5:03:11] <%realm_forge> Pat is the Colossus of Roads
[5:03:11] <%Alpha8087> Pat is empowered by the spirit of road construction in toronto
[5:03:12] <startstoprepeat> when the infrastucture's built, the new mission becomes repairing it all
[5:03:14] <ThDark> You underestimate how much infrastructure there is
[5:03:15] <%Takreth> Spend time grinding now so that you save time later
[5:03:17] <%StaceMcGate> Pat will build roads to all cities before he continues main story
[5:03:17] <%Takreth> That's the JRPG way
[5:03:19] <BurningLlama777> @deviljhojho_ You are beginning to see the code
[5:03:19] <Goergorion> stealing America from the dead
[5:03:20] <%marvel877> There's no roads climbing those mountains, Pat.
[5:03:21] <%AbnormalVoid> you can do infrastructure while you do the story, you know lol
[5:03:21] <%Doomcoder> @realm_forge fucking nice
[5:03:22] <rumuloh> Can you climb t the top of the chimeny?
[5:03:24] <+SickBangerzM9> Pat chooses to spend more time on the nothing gameplay than on the actual story stuff
[5:03:26] <%TheWinged7> @spacegineer i think you mean SAMcity Kappa
[5:03:26] <%Rumbutt> Good gameplay loop on the level of Monster Hunter
[5:03:27] <%Ranryu692> I'm glad for infrastructure because I haven't been watching and dont want to spoil too much story for myself lol
[5:03:30] <%AbnormalVoid> it's the best time to actually set shit up
[5:03:31] <%deviljhojho_> @BurningLlama777 True transcendence
[5:03:32] <Zaphire_Saucypants> You’ll thank yourself in the lategame
[5:03:33] <eiightbiitt> what chapter is this? @angriestpat
[5:03:34] <Kalinflip> yuh
[5:03:37] <+RAAAAAINMAKER> You'll totally make a zipline spiders web in the mountains
[5:03:39] <%joylent_blue> chapter 5
[5:03:39] <+Promessa_EX> getting so sleepy watching this
[5:03:40] <NeroInfinite> Yeah, but yahtzee said it was good so he CAN like it
[5:03:41] <%J_Papa> I tried to bring Chiral Artist here but they wouldn't take her
[5:03:43] <Monkeyweed21> GENDERED RIFLE
[5:03:46] <Meta_Four> Chapter 5.
[5:03:48] <%marvel877> barely started 5...4 hours ago.
[5:03:49] <%xtremegamer80> I tihnk there's more crystals around?
[5:03:49] <%StaceMcGate> So why can't planes or helicopters work in this world? electrofields?
[5:03:52] <BurningLlama777> This game does seem very relaxing most of the time
[5:03:54] <katocrimson> i have a bridge link with a player who maxed his title card. The picture and title is both amazing and hilarious
[5:04:05] <BurningLlama777> Ha ha ha ha
[5:04:07] <Dakuu75> can't transfer stuff from one truck to another if you park close enough?
[5:04:07] <dukenux> jesus
[5:04:08] <Taffer85> HURGH
[5:04:09] <lyzejag> GO GO
[5:04:10] <%WhackyChiraqi> @AngriestPat placing both trucks next to each other you can use a shared cargo menu
[5:04:11] <Taffer85> hurnia incoming
[5:04:11] <+RAAAAAINMAKER> more roads
[5:04:13] <%J_Papa> You can transfer from truck to truck if they're closer

[5:04:15] <BurningLlama777> Vertebrae: *snap*
[5:04:15] <%Jack_of_No_Trades> ONE TRIP
[5:04:16] <VritraReiRei> @AngriestPat if you park them close enough you can just transfer them THROUGH A MENU
[5:04:16] <spacegineer> Yeah, a copter would work wonders here.
[5:04:19] <$velgaduere> is there no way to bring one vehicle close to another and transfer between them?
[5:04:21] <dukenux> Your exoskeleton is givin up LUL

[5:05:10] <shadytreeofknowledge> basketball go
[5:05:10] <TheSandmanIsHere> go get more materials and build more roads
[5:05:14] <spacegineer> So keep them inside when its raining. Helicopters are fast enough to operate inbetween rainstorms.
[5:05:15] <+Reizie_Etherealm> Sam, it's me Drive-Hardman
[5:05:16] <NeroInfinite> he literally cannot finish the road

[5:05:58] <shadytreeofknowledge> do the Jump Patrick
[5:05:59] <%Alpha8087> Needs more monster energy trink
[5:06:00] <+Lillowh> CONTRIBUTE
[5:06:05] <%ArcanumMBD> the trick is to ignore roads now that you have ziplines, and to let the online suckers build your roads for you
[5:06:05] <+RAAAAAINMAKER> going to the centre puts it on the network so finish the road
[5:06:15] <%joylent_blue> yes hit it with your truck that helps
[5:06:17] <+8framelag> Country roads, take me home
[5:06:19] <shadytreeofknowledge> nanomachines
[5:06:21] <taquito_blade> Hey Pat, off topic but what dont you like about MK11?
[5:06:22] <Guardiansaiyan> @marvel877 those spikes are soft!
[5:06:22] <+RAAAAAINMAKER> you can build roads outside the network
[5:06:22] <lyzejag> You need special alloys
[5:06:29] <waifoong98> special allow
[5:06:31] <VritraReiRei> truck not close enough
[5:06:31] <%thenumber5point5> special alloy
[5:06:31] <lyzejag> Not metal
[5:06:34] <%J_Papa> Truck not close enough gets so annoying
[5:06:35] <$PulverKong> TEAR IT DOWN
[5:06:37] <spacegineer> There are no road building in mk11
[5:06:38] <%Meow0369> Who said that
[5:06:41] <%Meow0369> I wanted to see pat suffer
[5:06:41] <shadytreeofknowledge> where we go fuckin need roads
[5:06:43] <%moondog_> JUMP TRUCK
[5:06:44] <%Laecerelius> your alloys aren't special enough, Pat
[5:06:44] <%SlimeSlimeSlime> Pat is not metal enough.
[5:06:53] <lyzejag> Yeah the icon is almost the same
[5:06:55] <%honeyman18> I really like the road side motels and charging stations people make next to the road.
[5:06:57] <taquito_blade> @spacegineer well you got me there

[5:12:24] <+miguelrod777> quote pat on this
[5:12:27] <+SickBangerzM9> the more time you spend on the story, the less time you have to rebuild America pat
[5:12:28] <zeif00> Won't you not be able to build or use shit if you're off the chiral and doing a story quest?
[5:12:29] <TheSandmanIsHere> RE0 remake
[5:12:30] <worldbrand> wait wh
[5:12:31] <+dualviper25> WE KNOW PAT
[5:12:31] <blackesteagle> Imagine RE4 remake
[5:12:31] <BurningLlama777> The time limits in this game feel reasonable. Time limits usually stress me out in games.
[5:12:33] <%TheWinged7> he will be playing a screaming little girl in a video
[5:12:33] <artoflec> For real though pat, do you think Code Veronica should/would get a remake of that calibur?
[5:12:36] <EuropanLamprey> Confirmed: Elmo's the leaker
[5:12:38] <lyzejag> I hope Elden Ring will be shown at the VGA
[5:12:41] <ThatOneGuyYouSaw> @AngriestPat how long until the fixed camera RE4 remake?
[5:12:43] <shadytreeofknowledge> that truck is bowling shoe ugly
[5:12:44] <%Meow0369> Boost in truck
[5:12:54] <%StaceMcGate> @AngriestPat would you still be interested in this game if it had no ghosts or plot?
[5:12:54] <%Alpha8087> DRIFT TRUCK
[5:12:55] <LunarRemix> Because you are not supposed to have roads
[5:12:56] <%Engwithan_Elder_God> Half the route is already paved.
[5:12:57] <%Doomcoder> is the time shorter on harder difficulties?
[5:12:57] <TheHeroAppears> YOU'LL NEVER MAKE IT
[5:12:58] <+Reizie_Etherealm> NICE SAVE
[5:13:00] <%Laecerelius> They don't expect you to be such a road building badass
[5:13:00] <KeystoneA1> @Meow0369 much as I love RE4 I don't think it needs any more re-releases or remakes/remasters. It was Skyrim before Skyrim in that regard.
[5:13:00] <artoflec> calibre * ..calibur? artofl1Hm
[5:13:01] <%GarbageNirvana> Dude's bleeding out but it's on a drip so it's fine
[5:13:01] <taquito_blade> wait can you flip the truck??
[5:13:02] <+SickBangerzM9> they probably didnt expect you to already have rebuild america and have a truck
[5:13:03] <%doc_ock_rokc> Well if you ran it you would take that long
[5:13:03] <%AbnormalVoid> yeah, but you gotta get there in 8 if you want a good rank
[5:13:03] <waifoong98> because u built all those roads Pat
[5:13:07] <faldin> re4 remake with no shitty tank control
[5:13:07] <Dakuu75> LOL
[5:13:07] <%Binary_Fireball> I BUILT EVERY ROAD
[5:13:07] <+keyoray> 40mins is still way less than an ER wait time
[5:13:08] <$velgaduere> I mean, 40 minutes until someone dies is a lot of time, but it's also not a lot of time
[5:13:08] <shadytreeofknowledge> the physics tho
[5:13:09] <%honeyman18> DEJA VU
[5:13:10] <%Binary_Fireball> ALL OF THEM
[5:13:11] <Shwepie> Not giving yourself increased time restriction for more likes?
[5:13:15] <%Alpha8087> Pat goblins hsi way to victory
[5:13:15] <%Binary_Fireball> it was hard
[5:13:16] <+paladinstarbuster> Yeah theese time limits should be way shorter
[5:13:17] <EuropanLamprey> Does that truck have gyroscopes in it, it never tips.
[5:13:17] <+Reizie_Etherealm> Pat is overleveled once again!
[5:13:19] <+RAAAAAINMAKER> yeah you're supposed to deal with that forrest bullshit

[5:13:23] <Dakuu75> does this mean Pat is Overleveled, because roads XD
[5:13:23] <shadytreeofknowledge> roads dont equal jump

[5:14:20] <%thenumber5point5> be the General Lee
[5:14:21] <%Meow0369> seriously, those roads are actually being teleported in from back in time
[5:14:22] <Run44forrest> D:
[5:14:23] <%J_Papa> Won't be hearing the music for very long, every trip is completed in a vehicle

[5:17:53] <%Black_Machete> go to the mules pat
[5:17:58] <spacegineer> Would this game be better if you didn't have to drive between chiral network stations to build roads, and could instead build roads for longer stretches.

[5:32:43] <zenith0111> Jump up and down with the bomb
[5:32:44] <%InugamiTheHound> all your base belong to us
[5:32:44] <+Reizie_Etherealm> Don't fail this one on purpose please
[5:32:45] <+NitronStreams> THIS! IS! STUPID!
[5:32:45] <spacegineer> Use the bomb to get some leverage the next time you want a raise.
[5:32:45] <Sol_Install> Sam has to deliever fucking ANTIMATTER and BT NUKES
[5:32:49] <%Taisuru> DO IT PAT
[5:32:50] <Mister_McDerp> i'm already anxious just hearing about it
[5:32:50] <%Valdorick> bomb*
[5:32:51] <Monkeyweed21> SAVE AND THROW IT
[5:32:51] <Dingo_Eejit> DEFUSE YOUR SINS!
[5:32:51] <TheReaperofGrim> Time to quick save and drop it
[5:32:53] <Junkfist> Drill a small hole in the bottom of the antimatter bomb and jetpack west to the end of the game
[5:32:55] <%WhackyChiraqi> Playing this mission feels like trying to move around a house where everyone is asleep
[5:32:55] <waifoong98> all you need to do is kick it like a soccer and you will end up like Tidus LUL
[5:32:56] <TheSandmanIsHere> and yeah, save your game
[5:32:59] <%TheMilhouseExperience> Okay I’m on break. Oh pat is almost to the second 1/3rd of the game.
[5:33:00] <Zaphire_Saucypants> Auto arrange sat shit
[5:33:00] <Jflaskd13> the bomb explosions look lame guys so relax
[5:33:04] <%takiyami> Could that bomb be any more precariously stacked
[5:33:04] <BurningLlama777> I feel like this was dropped on us REALLY casually.
[5:33:04] <%Taisuru> EAT THE BOMB
[5:33:06] <%WhackyChiraqi> and trying not to make a ruckus
[5:33:06] <%xtremegamer80> A shitload of spray?
[5:33:07] <%J_Papa> A speed skeleton
[5:33:10] <+RAAAAAINMAKER> fabricate a road bitch
[5:33:12] <zenith0111> The best part is you do this twice LUL
[5:33:12] <+RootVeggie> Why does Sam look like a SoundCloud Rapper?
[5:33:13] <Taffer85> grenade
[5:33:19] <BurningLlama777> Die Hardman just kinda glossed through this little assignment
[5:33:21] <%ryome> Where are our Doritos?
[5:33:24] <%realm_forge> IS THIS WHAT YOUR PRECIOUS ROADS WERE FOR? FOR DELIVERING NUKES?
[5:33:32] <%TheMilhouseExperience> Speed skeleton is really good.
[5:33:37] <%Binary_Fireball> hey thats cheating
[5:33:38] <d00hicky2> How long has Pat been streaming?
[5:33:38] <waifoong98> Save then maybe try to throw it to see what happens? Kappa
[5:33:42] <djFishmonger> I feel like there HAS to be an easier way...
[5:33:44] <%joylent_blue> !uptime
[5:33:44] <@Moobot> I've been playing this game for how long? Oh only 5h 33m.
[5:33:44] <Darkrenai> Is he putting the nuke on the floaty boy
[5:33:46] <%Meow0369> bad iodea
[5:33:46] <+RAAAAAINMAKER> brave choice
[5:33:49] <%TheMilhouseExperience> Lvl3 is the best
[5:33:49] <Run44forrest> 5Head
[5:33:49] <%WhackyChiraqi> If only we had some kind of mobile weapons platform we could use to carry the nukes
[5:33:49] <%Meow0369> real bad idea
[5:33:50] <%J_Papa> Why does he never take off the fucking power skeleton
[5:33:51] <%juxtest> Good luck hover carrier
[5:33:51] <Hydrapissed> awwwwwwwwwwww yeh
[5:33:52] <Hydrapissed> let it go
[5:33:54] <%Binary_Fireball> @AngriestPat or you can drop it a bunch inside the base
[5:33:55] <Hydrapissed> YEYEYEYEYE boom!
[5:33:55] <%GeneralSCPatton> My man knows how to fucking do it! YEYEYE! Stabilize that shit!
[5:34:00] <Taffer85> whered you get the utility pouch upgrade
[5:34:00] <%Meow0369> @J_Papa Because it's amazing
[5:34:02] <+RAAAAAINMAKER> manual save
[5:34:03] <dukenux> Is that really more safe?
[5:34:07] <%Razputin217> That's a BOLD STRATEGY COTTON
[5:34:07] <djFishmonger> I want it to instantly blow up
[5:34:08] <%WhackyChiraqi> @Taffer85 Cosplayer
[5:34:10] <%GarbageNirvana> I've made antimatter bomb deliveries on carriers before
[5:34:11] <shiny_prinny> this can only end well
[5:34:13] <Darkrenai> Gotta go FAST
[5:34:13] <Run44forrest> no
[5:34:13] <%realm_forge> Pat. Don’t fuck up.
[5:34:15] <%joylent_blue> J_Papa because he needs more P O W E R
[5:34:17] <waifoong98> LUL
[5:34:17] <Daxalog> Technically if it blows up now its not Pats fault
[5:34:22] <Taffer85> @WhackyChiraqi ah I never bothered much with her
[5:34:23] <+Reizie_Etherealm> Why would he take off the exo-skeleton is the better question
[5:34:24] <%J_Papa> nice
[5:34:26] <$KnivesEve> blow up blow up
[5:34:28] <spacegineer> But first, dunk a monster.
[5:34:29] <%Tucker0603> HAHAHAHHAHAHAHAHHA THIS GoNA BE GOOOOD!!!
[5:34:30] <zenith0111> Did you unlock the stabilizer?
[5:34:30] <%WhackyChiraqi> @Taffer85 she rules dude

[5:34:37] <%Varlinator> Go Fast. Eat Ass.
[5:34:40] <ThatOneGuyYouSaw> oh hey, it's one of those things
[5:34:41] <tiaramaki> Nice
[5:34:42] <$PulverKong> BLOW IT UP BLOW IT UP
[5:34:44] <%thenumber5point5> did it on bike case was ruined and bomb was at 10% but we made it lol
[5:34:44] <+RAAAAAINMAKER> put that shit in a locker
[5:34:44] <%Taisuru> EAT THE BOMB
[5:34:45] <corpsegoo> once it's on a carrier you need to make a concentrated effort to explode it
[5:34:46] <%J_Papa> It's a little antimatter pet
[5:34:47] <SpaceGuntank> he only has about 1000 chiral crystals though, will it be enough?
[5:34:47] <%xtremegamer80> So the carrier can catch up with the speed skeletion, right?
[5:34:47] <+D00msDayDan> come along now little nuke
[5:34:47] <%Valdorick> And chuck the bomb into the wall
[5:34:49] <%Bt_Robot> EXPLODE IT!
[5:34:49] <%WhackyChiraqi> "Be very careful" builds the run fast skeleton lmao
[5:34:49] <TheReaperofGrim> blow it up!
[5:34:51] <Hydrapissed> Blow it up go ogog ogog
[5:34:52] <+SkaiVibration> thank god
[5:34:52] <%realm_forge> Pat don’t fuck up
[5:34:53] <%marvel877> Shoot the bomb

[5:34:55] <%joylent_blue> now chuck it off a cliff
[5:34:58] <%Explodincatz> im ready for fun
[5:35:02] <+keyoray> Don't worry, it doesn't matter
[5:35:08] <%Taisuru> USE THE NUKE AS A SLED
[5:35:09] <Mister_McDerp> will a zipline set it off/
[5:35:09] <%WhackyChiraqi> @AngriestPat you can switch skeletons with up on the d pad
[5:35:11] <corpsegoo> as opposed to the average vehicle which can down it 50% in the first ten seconds out the door
[5:35:13] <Delenay> did someone make a ziplin for pat
[5:35:16] <zenith0111> Tony Hawks: Antimatter Bomb Extravaganza

[5:35:58] <Guardiansaiyan> @AngriestPat R3
[5:35:59] <+RootVeggie> You can't switch to the Power Skeleton with D-Pad because it removes you leg cargo

[5:36:45] <ThatOneGuyYouSaw> @AngriestPat don't use a zipline, it'll set the nuke off
[5:36:45] <%honeyman18> Since it's not technically a nuke, does that make it not bad?

[5:41:14] <+Reizie_Etherealm> Sam, It's me Shoot-Gunman
[5:41:15] <agumon9000> nvm
[5:41:15] <TrollKing96> @AngriestPat Why didn't you use the zipline?
[5:41:17] <Meta_Four> Pat's using non-lethal rounds I thought.

[5:41:19] <$velgaduere> it amazes me how many people didn't see him build the nonlethal rifle
[5:41:22] <Run44forrest> @seaearthandsky he's using a non lethal gun

[5:41:38] <%honeyman18> I thought nonlethal rounds were blue, must be me.
[5:41:38] <ThatOneGuyYouSaw> are there even lethal weapons in this game?

[5:41:54] <%Meow0369> pat might actually die here if he doesn't be careful
[5:41:55] <%GeneralSCPatton> @thatoneguyyousaw Yes
[5:41:55] <%Mekhet09> The ziplines he has don't connect to anything. Other people's ziplines rarely do because they don't give you an entire zipline set just like one or two.
[5:41:56] <+Reizie_Etherealm> ENEMIES EVERYWHERE
[5:41:58] <%thenumber5point5> yep
[5:42:00] <%Valdorick> @saibayadon Does the word AM-bomb mean anything to you?

[5:44:12] <%king_wragles> That battery... is unsure if there's a god?
[5:44:15] <agumon9000> Safehouse charges batteries
[5:44:16] <tiaramaki> Hah?
[5:44:19] <%doc_ock_rokc> Batteries generally don't believe in god @AngriestPat
[5:44:21] <IntrepidDolphin> if you rest it'll recharge the battery
[5:44:22] <%TheMilhouseExperience> Now the mules have guns. Wait till they get body armor.
[5:44:22] <zenith0111> I just forget it since they only mention it once.
[5:44:23] <+joekuta71> Could rest at the safe house to charge up
[5:44:25] <%Tucker0603> rest to charge battery
[5:44:27] <Nina96> that gun didnt seem that helpful @AngriestPat
[5:44:28] <Run44forrest> this battery has NO GOD
[5:44:30] <agumon9000> Safehouse charges the batter
[5:44:31] <PirateMike_> Battery does not have religious views
[5:44:31] <Mister_McDerp> its doesn't know if theres a god?
[5:44:31] <Lelfro> Have faith, Battery-kun!
[5:44:32] <%Keyd00d> agnostic
[5:44:34] <Taffer85> safehouuuuuse
[5:44:34] <dukenux> battery doesnt outright disprove the existence of higher power?
[5:44:34] <%thenumber5point5> good base point, made alot of use of a shelter in the same place on my game
[5:44:35] <%DracaenaLeaf> I spaced out and didn't think it was a base playing the music oops
[5:44:37] <%joylent_blue> it does not conform to traditional concepts of religion
[5:44:38] <%J_Papa> Resting at the shelter will recharge your batteries
[5:44:42] <%king_wragles> @AngriestPat agnostic battery? What, are their atheist charge packs?
[5:44:46] <%Meow0369> BT country son
[5:44:47] <+VideoGameTim_> the problem is the bola isnt a guaranteed knockout whereas the gun is
[5:44:48] <Run44forrest> you missed almost every shot
[5:44:55] <TheSandmanIsHere> it's electric too, so it's an E-bola

[5:47:08] <Ion_Laser> Gotta be nice and drunk to deliver this bomb
[5:47:10] <BurningLlama777> At the end of a long day, I find nothing refreshes like an ice cold Time Fall Porter.

[5:48:22] <dukenux> Yes, just like Doc Ock in Spider-man 2
[5:48:22] <%Meow0369> It's very unclear as to what they're using a fucking antimatter bomb for
[5:48:23] <+subdude_> We saved the city
[5:48:24] <fist_wizard_jay> TO DESTROY THE NUKES?
[5:48:26] <$HyperionXV> I assume it's gonna be like throwing the nuke into the tar lake
[5:48:27] <Darkrenai> Deez roads
[5:48:28] <Goergorion> @AngriestPat since you just saved, Can we see it blow up?
[5:48:28] <+Qsmash_> @AngriestPat You're saving the city SUPER HARD by nuking it
[5:48:29] <PirateMike_> Burn it down and built a new city from the ashes
[5:48:29] <+2DSuperiority> did you know that nukes are bad?
[5:48:30] <chronoxgp> she'll be coming down the mountain when she comes
[5:48:30] <+Reizie_Etherealm> Blow up the city to stop the spread to every other city I guess
[5:48:31] <%joylent_blue> Hippineapple228 its not out on any other platform right now
[5:48:31] <Mister_McDerp> I think you're just giving it to the city
[5:48:32] <%Varlinator> ohnYes

[5:48:51] <%joylent_blue> that seems safe
[5:48:52] <zenith0111> No one listened for why they need it after they heard ANTIMATTER BOMB LUL
[5:48:52] <%Meow0369> Oh my god

[5:48:53] <Delenay> lol

[5:49:31] <waifoong98> BT mountain probably
[5:49:34] <+Reizie_Etherealm> Do we even know if the antimatter effect will sever the connection to the other side? Isn't that just a chiral matter density thing?
[5:49:37] <ScreamLord> Otters are immune to Time
[5:49:39] <+RAAAAAINMAKER> no bts here though

[5:50:01] <%xtremegamer80> Carrier is our gonk droid
[5:50:02] <Nina96> nope

[5:51:32] <+Reizie_Etherealm> @zenith0111 That's just what I've heard from Die-Hardman's explanation, but I know it's to try and stop the tar from spreading further. It's just even if we get rid of the tar now, there's no guarantee it won't come back later

[6:09:34] <BurningLlama777> True Fact: Norman Reedus IRL requires a special toilet made of steel because the force of his flow cracks normal bowls.
[6:09:36] <%pilgrimsayswhat> "Norman I need you to make pee grunts into the microphone"
[6:09:37] <%king_wragles> @AngriestPat that's like... a 2 meter long stream man

[6:09:52] <%RAGING_1NF3RNO> RAGING_1NF3RNO subscribed at Tier 1. They've subscribed for 2 months! With your recent interest in getting back into fighting games and your recent tweets about Tekken, are you thinking of trying it out? I'd love to play/coach you.
[6:09:52] <GMN1> wtf

[6:09:55] <KeystoneA1> @AngriestPat I know this is just a videogame but realistically the only way to get 1000ml of piss is if you have urinary retention from pain medication or some other bad issues
[6:09:55] <+korth367> Bryanna4295
[6:09:57] <%DracaenaLeaf> peeing on the road is disgusting, cars will drive over it

[6:10:00] <mostundesired> Yeyeyeye
[6:10:01] <Calamity2007> Pee nuke
[6:10:01] <Bigyin396> He actually pees very slowly. As someone who has pissed more than a litre before (into a 1.5L bottle and I nearly filled it) I can tell you it should not take taht long to pee that much
[6:10:04] <Koosahmii> Well I thought I had room in the bag
[6:10:04] <Shwepie> I'm sure Paige would be more interested if it was a skeleton reedus peeing.
[6:10:05] <%JJCheeker> He has a lot of range

[6:10:38] <StarvingPenguinGod> Pog
[6:10:41] <xoyv> i didn't realize that ziplines were so dope in this game

[6:11:01] <%honeyman18> Is this the new Ladder Scene?
[6:11:02] <BurningLlama777> I think I like the tech in the Death Stranding universe a lot more than other games I've seen.
[6:11:04] <Gregorhasjoined> Otter time
[6:11:04] <+polypolipauli> So the game, is to progressively remove the gameplay inbetween the cutscenes??
[6:11:09] <mostundesired> What at thrill...

[6:22:04] <ScreamLord> It even looks like the beach you fight the Orphan on
[6:22:06] <%GeneralSCPatton> @AngriestPat Also, the ocean seems to be made of tar, or at least not water, because the canteen doesn't refill out here.
[6:22:07] <%Typhaeon> They're like Man-O-War

[6:22:23] <+marsanta> It looks like bloodborne plip plop
[6:22:29] <%Seraphile> what happens if you sleep on the beach
[6:22:30] <FstSergeant8595> ^

[6:22:45] <BurningLlama777> Man-o-wars are already horrible demons
