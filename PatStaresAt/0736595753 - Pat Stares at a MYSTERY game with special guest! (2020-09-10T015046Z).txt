[0:30:52] <%crimsonharvest> If it falls out you need to call for help
[0:30:52] <%Ranryu692> not since the 90s
[0:30:52] <Darmansk> good snap
[0:30:53] <+SharlotteScott> Only if your shorts are SUPER tiny
[0:30:53] <heartlesshealer> Only if you're wearing hotpants or being real trashy =)

[2:49:31] <%Ninestempest> Patina is a thin layer that variously forms on the surface of copper, brass, bronze and similar metals, or certain stones, and wooden furniture, or any similar acquired change of a surface through age and exposure. Additionally, the term is used to describe the aging of high-quality leather

[3:05:24] <%XzileGaming> spider money
[3:05:27] <+OnTheDonner> @PatStaresAt You need to unlock it later on for the runes
[3:05:30] <huskarl_zap> why does it make a gun sound?
[3:05:30] <3ffloresce> do you eat eggs with the wrapper on or off
[3:05:32] <+CMash2k> why no paige play??
[3:05:36] <%SharkMissile> You have to do the wizard rescue mission before you can use runes.
[3:05:39] <$floralkami> @binaryfireball ikr.
[3:05:43] <+SinisterBroccoli> paige sleep
[3:05:46] <Manwad> she needs to rub her huge ass on the runes
[3:05:48] <Zaphire_Saucypants> cuz Paige is tired and broken
[3:05:48] <ScreamLord> @PatStaresAt You're pretty fuckin' tall for a Dwarf
[3:05:52] <%AquilaHarukaze> I can't handle that aggressive arm pumping in the walk animation
[3:05:57] <Jotofar> if this art style had a name, what would it be?
[3:06:00] <heartlesshealer> poison crossbow
[3:06:00] <$RealThiele> Welcome to the D&D world!
[3:06:03] <%AquilaHarukaze> Those should also be attacks.
[3:06:04] <$floralkami> @binaryfireball we could have had amazon ass, but Pat played her already
[3:06:11] <huskarl_zap> QUICK PUMP ONE PUMP

[3:07:09] <%JenovasPuppet> Which is the bigger backdown: Paige not doing DS2 DLC or Pat not playing Sorceress?
[3:07:10] <%BinaryFireball> @floralkami dwarf ass is ok
[3:07:11] <KingKrampus> if only playing d&d was like this
[3:07:13] <%BoxNavy> i saw it
[3:07:17] <1BeatGames> Wait we're not Sorceress?
[3:07:25] <lloyddboy> PAT HAS A FLAMETHROWER
[3:07:25] <%SovPho> I'm going to go get a business owner's loan and make a bar called the Dabbing Dwarf
[3:07:31] <Coystick> Bone boys!
[3:07:31] <heartlesshealer> Paige super missed out on these skeletons
[3:07:32] <ScreamLord> Has Plague tried cleaning out his PS4? Mine was pretty loud too until I took a can of air to it blasted all the dirt out. Not I barely hear it most of the time
[3:07:32] <i_am_therydon> @1BeatGames pat bitched out
[3:07:37] <+Grayhammatter> pat cowarded out

[3:08:06] <PrettyThickandStrongDyck> who the fuck makes multiplayer an unlockable?

[3:08:12] <Fear_Ranjer> WHYYYYY
[3:08:15] <+Ancopro> not very long, and not true lol
[3:08:15] <JonEWorldbeater> Skellington extremely weak to fire
[3:08:17] <%ShinobiPhoenix> so... like Avengers
[3:08:18] <zamzoph> I really like Odin Sphere's story
[3:08:20] <KoyaMusa> no you can skip on other characters
[3:08:20] <heartlesshealer> Unlockable multiplayer is shit
[3:08:20] <Finakala> Pretty sure it's not per character
[3:08:21] <$floralkami> @binaryfireball lytWAH
[3:08:22] <%trustycoyote> Nah, not per character
[3:08:23] <+pkmamsters> "I'm probably lying" - Pat
[3:08:23] <%BoxNavy> thats not a true
[3:08:27] <%AncelDeLambert> look at this half sized Zangief
[3:08:29] <+Ancopro> once you do with one character you're good
[3:08:29] <+Nymphonomicon> The real tutorial is the game we were playing all along.

[3:08:52] <%AdamElJefe> Birb tiddies
[3:08:52] <%Taisuru> Did Plague make this game?
[3:08:53] <Coystick> Massive chicken legs
[3:08:53] <+Ancopro> ARE YOU SURE
[3:08:53] <KoyaMusa> oh paige screams
[3:08:54] <+Grayhammatter> on its face?
[3:08:57] <%cvp5127> Kreygasm
[3:08:57] <$RealThiele> Hangers
[3:08:58] <Oxybe> What about reverse harpy?
[3:08:59] <heartlesshealer> Mouth too small to nourish body!!!
[3:08:59] <+Nymphonomicon> TOS
[3:09:00] <%AquilaHarukaze> Imagine breast feeding a bird.
[3:09:02] <bazz_tv> that was an update patch actually
[3:09:02] <Parapattern> Those are some Big Ol Eekum Bokums
[3:09:05] <Fear_Ranjer> Oh yea it *is* a harpy
[3:09:05] <+pkmamsters> It's like a centaur but bird....and bababangos
[3:09:07] <TheLemuroid> I thought that was its face
[3:09:07] <%ClericOfSparda> That cracked me up. I forgot the Harpy had knockers
[3:09:11] <tonfirean> That reminds me of Double King
[3:09:14] <huskarl_zap> nice plague
[3:09:16] <Wan6Saber> tits!
[3:09:20] <Daebunz> odin sphere fucking rules
[3:09:21] <%PhysicsLB> it was a genital harpy
[3:09:21] <gordieda20> LUL
[3:09:24] <%AzureGale> Die, harpy! You don't belong in this world!
[3:09:24] <JonEWorldbeater> And yet, smallest tits so far
[3:09:24] <%trustycoyote> Fuck Odin's Sphere is so fucking good
[3:09:25] <%CzeekyPlays> That's the dumbest harpy design I've ever seen
[3:09:25] <lloyddboy> deddebbb
[3:09:26] <NekoUrabe> Looked like the pokemon Archeops
[3:09:27] <$RealThiele> B for Bad
[3:09:29] <%TheWinged7> DEDDEBBB
[3:09:30] <Coystick> I bet Plague being proportion-obsessed will be in pain looking at some of these designs
[3:09:31] <+Nymphonomicon> Harpy Lady defeated.
[3:09:33] <%Wade_Willson> Pluck the breast
[3:09:40] <$floralkami> DED DEBB
[3:09:40] <+Ancopro> lol true
[3:09:41] <1BeatGames> Damnit Pat, I pass out for a little bit and you wuss out on sexy sorceress
[3:09:41] <+SinisterBroccoli> The VITA version of Odynsphere is great
[3:09:42] <$RealThiele> Vita version was nice to have on mobile
[3:09:43] <%de1ete_forever> not very cash money
[3:09:52] <zamzoph> Odette boss in PS2 Odin Sphere is ALL LAG
[3:09:54] <Finakala> The Vita version of Muramasa is honestly one of the best games ever made, and the DLC is even better than the core game
[3:09:57] <%CzeekyPlays> This makes me want to play Gauntlet Legends
[3:09:58] <Bustahhwulf> certain? more like anytime u used a spell in odin sphere LMAO
[3:09:59] <%SharkMissile> Remember the PSP FF Tactics?
[3:10:01] <Daebunz> get that hammer
[3:10:02] <heartlesshealer> Drakengard 3 levels of slowdown? D:
[3:10:03] <bazz_tv> originally you had to play the initial story with everyone
[3:10:05] <WakeUpThrow> PS2 Odin Sphere was hell
[3:10:07] <%TheWinged7> the glowy one
[3:10:09] <$RealThiele> Gauntlet legends with 4 people is amazing
[3:10:11] <+Ancopro> ps2 odin sphere is also a nightmare compared to the remaster
[3:10:15] <artoflec> god i want muramasa HD so bad elaREE
[3:10:17] <%AzureGale> Odin Sphere Leifthrasir is Vanillaware at its finest
[3:10:18] <%Monkeyweed21> appraise the best one
[3:10:19] <Profmcstevie> I do not recall that at all, and me and my brother played all the way to the top of the tower in Dragons Crown
[3:10:27] <%trustycoyote> Appraise good shit, sell lower tier stuff
[3:10:27] <Finakala> But yeah I have both the Vita and PS2 versions of Odin Sphere and the PS2 version barely works
[3:10:28] <zamzoph> the lag actually helped to dodge shit Kappa
[3:10:29] <KoyaMusa> well currently anything is better than what you got
[3:10:29] <%Chimeraelite> Also rank B weapon so best stuff
[3:10:32] <+RealPT1> gold is fluid anyways
[3:10:32] <$RealThiele> Diablo loot
[3:10:35] <huskarl_zap> >dwarf not knowing how to make something
[3:10:35] <heartlesshealer> poison's nice
[3:10:36] <Bustahhwulf> cast base spell which was tornado game would freeze for a minute
[3:10:36] <%MaddyCaddy> It's made of Uranium
[3:10:38] <Fear_Ranjer> I'm assuming you're identifying for potential duplicates
[3:10:39] <bazz_tv> ps3 didn't had as much slowdown, unless you where in a full party
[3:10:42] <+SinisterBroccoli> it sells for more if you appraise it
[3:10:42] <%Rumbutt> about to be toxic
[3:10:43] <Coystick> Remember that one staircase fight in Ninja Gaiden 2 that slowed down so bad for so long it was actually cool ?
[3:10:43] <gamezerox> Radioactive mean valuable
[3:10:50] <KoyaMusa> sell rest
[3:10:51] <%juxtest> warpstone yes yes
[3:11:07] <%luftraumm1> why no pc port?
[3:11:10] <%SWFanatic> Eekum Bokum
[3:11:21] <artoflec> i really hope after 13 sentinels its Muramasa HD and another new game for Vanillaware
[3:11:23] <%luftraumm1> i would tottally buy this bullshit for pc
[3:11:29] <$RealThiele> Vanillaware is like atlus with their games
[3:11:31] <NekoUrabe> The werewolf boss?
[3:11:33] <+RealPT1> at a point you only appraise rares of shinies
[3:11:33] <+Ancopro> wish there was a pc port lol
[3:11:36] <%AdamElJefe> Everything in this world has big tiddues
[3:11:36] <%de1ete_forever> so metal slug tech
[3:11:37] <MsYakumo> Delicious warp stone.
[3:11:40] <huskarl_zap> ninja gaiden 2 slow down? so all fights
[3:11:43] <Finakala> I'd say Drakengard 3 runs better than PS2 Odin Sphere honestly, and that's saying a lot
[3:11:48] <%ShinobiPhoenix> is Dragon's crown Pro even on Steam?
[3:11:49] <%Keyd00d> Is 13 Sentinels more of a VN?
[3:11:55] <heartlesshealer> Pat
[3:11:59] <Finakala> Because Drakengard 3 runs like ASS
[3:12:04] <bazz_tv> Apprasing is only worth on A to S loot, also best loot thends to be in secret room or hidden on runes
[3:12:05] <Parapattern> Pat Eekum Bokum-ed himself
[3:12:06] <$RealThiele> no a big reveal
[3:12:09] <%Chimeraelite> oh jesus christ NO
[3:12:10] <%Keyd00d> NotLikeThis
[3:12:10] <%StaceMcGate> YEYEYEYE
[3:12:12] <Coystick> Oh no

[3:16:15] <lloyddboy> DIN VIESEL
[3:16:15] <%AdamElJefe> It's called lazy animating
[3:16:15] <heartlesshealer> Also the Grim Grimoire game (by this same studio)

[3:31:45] <%CommanderSqueaks> @Arrowheart17 Hey, at least Kojima TRIED to justify his fan service. Just like how Androids have to show their ass in Nier Automata because their butts are their heat sinks (yes this is literally canon).
[3:31:54] <%YakumoYomi> @OnTheDonner Ah, I see you are a man of culture as well.
[3:31:54] <%de1ete_forever> or children, you know, whoever
[3:31:55] <Coystick> Wyrm is such a fun word

[3:33:40] <+TheMeromex> amazon all the way
[3:33:43] <%MisterRockett> You're forgetting one, Pat.
[3:33:49] <%YakumoYomi> @Coystick It's actually Dragon's Crown.
[3:33:49] <+FatherGreyBeard> @SovPho correct
[3:33:50] <$Futurecity10> Elf best girl
[3:33:53] <ShinMaddrox> Elf is not beginner friendly
[3:33:54] <Ner234> The GREAT thief
[3:33:55] <+SinisterBroccoli> knight is my style
[3:33:57] <%trustycoyote> He has pseudo-tank moves which are pretty neat in a brawler
[3:34:01] <Decarcassor> Wizard is a super glass canon. Witch has great support spells.
[3:34:02] <KoyaMusa> oh god kick elf
[3:34:04] <RemnanTaka> Big PAY ME enrgy
[3:34:05] <%MisterRockett> What about Wizard?
[3:34:07] <lloyddboy> tommit like GIVE ME YOUR PHONE
[3:34:08] <%SharkMissile> The elf can do a lot of cool melee kick combos
[3:34:13] <%Solid_Stro> Amazon’s spinning air axe is insane
[3:34:13] <Bustahhwulf> parry everything with amazon's thicc ass
[3:34:13] <+MrBaldachin> the elf is like the only time i've enjoyed played a ranged character
[3:34:24] <%ShinobiPhoenix> my main was originally Wizard
[3:34:24] <%arcaderabbit48> Witch can also conjure skeletons to fight for her
[3:34:28] <%SharkMissile> lel well rounded
[3:34:29] <heartlesshealer> witch can combo
[3:34:31] <%Keyd00d> I love that fan comic of the wizard coming in on a meteor
[3:34:32] <swansong118> "well rounded" indeed
[3:34:33] <+Nemesisnick33> well rounded indeed Kreygasm
[3:34:35] <%ShinobiPhoenix> secondary is Elf
[3:34:36] <%AquilaHarukaze> Oh she's rounded alright
[3:34:37] <%Monkeyweed21> Sorceress running attack is just her ass

[3:34:55] <vVAstrAVv> witch has better minnions
[3:34:55] <%SovPho> Dwarf actually swimming in the shallow end

[3:35:05] <vVAstrAVv> fuck the wizards golem
[3:35:06] <ScreamLord> It's like Jaws if the shark was a buff short guy
[3:35:07] <heartlesshealer> she got the hat, witch is fine
[3:35:08] <quietshun> this game is a big favorite
[3:35:09] <%CommanderSqueaks> "Wait for it to surface." "YOU MEAN FLAIL AT IT WHILE IT'S UNDER WATER?"
[3:35:22] <%AzureGale> I like how the sorceress's priority is making sure sue doesn't lose her hat when she runs
[3:35:23] <smilingseer> Wait the character that Pat is playing now.... Can he be thrown by the Amazon and Knight?
[3:35:28] <%Solid_Stro> Nobody Tosses A Dwarf. doodStare
[3:35:47] <swansong118> Nobody WANTS to toss a dwarf
[3:35:49] <smilingseer> Dang it!
[3:35:49] <KoyaMusa> it sad cause the ai get really bad later on
[3:35:51] <%CommanderSqueaks> The sorceress' run cycle is kind of adorable.
[3:35:57] <heartlesshealer> man, it probably is
[3:35:59] <+paladinstarbuster> youll need them later
[3:35:59] <%Keyd00d> It scales with number of companions right?
[3:36:02] <quietshun> I play solo usually
[3:36:08] <%YakumoYomi> Having a party makes the enemies have more health, I think.
[3:36:10] <ShinMaddrox> as god intended
[3:36:10] <+OnTheDonner> I kinda hate the whole pointer finger shit. "stop and try and poitn at something for a bit, then move on"
[3:36:19] <ScreamLord> I'd rather they AI companions be too good than totally shit
[3:36:26] <%MaddyCaddy> Scorpions stored in chests for hundreds of years
[3:36:27] <ShinMaddrox> He steals your money and experience
[3:36:29] <+paladinstarbuster> he picks up loot
[3:36:30] <%SovPho> who wouldn't

[3:40:13] <%trustycoyote> Wyverns = 2 legs + 2 wings. Dragons = 4 legs + 2 wings.

[3:52:56] <%arcaderabbit48> Is Paige a real person? We just don't know.
[3:52:57] <%rumtumtugnutz> Paige is a clicker. The mold has taken her.
[3:53:02] <+Zeta_Spiral> you never see the sorceress' far shoulder despite her far boob jutting out a half length further than the close boob

[3:58:24] <%cervidaequus> Oh its THAT monky
[3:58:27] <%arcaderabbit48> Society literally would not exist. Memes, tropes, and shared ideas form the backbone of society and history
[3:58:30] <%YakumoYomi> Thank you, Eli.
[3:58:30] <%SirGO0SE> quiettShrug
[3:58:31] <%SaiyanShoto> LUL LUL
[3:58:33] <%luftraumm1> can't you wear more than one accessory?
[3:58:35] <+Grayhammatter> LUL
[3:58:38] <%Keyd00d> ...

[3:58:54] <%de1ete_forever> ...
[3:58:56] <%BoxNavy> yeah i know
[3:58:57] <%Keyd00d> But he was dead
[3:59:00] <$RealThiele> Greek Dick jokes were confirmed which is good to know
[3:59:10] <JonEWorldbeater> We'd be in space now if not for shitposting
[3:59:18] <+Billyuppercut0> Lucain is slain
[3:59:19] <pilllowofbees> for his pleasure
[3:59:19] <%YakumoYomi> You are also made of meat, Plague.
[3:59:20] <scoot_io> Memes are the DNA of the soul
[3:59:20] <munitalprats> ive seen hammers like that in media sometimes
[3:59:22] <+Copycat_Joker> why does plague sound like he's right next to me and Pat sounds like he's dying?
[3:59:23] <munitalprats> they're weird
[3:59:27] <Profmcstevie> So it's double sided
[3:59:34] <Coystick> Curved hammers. CURVED. HAMMERS.
[3:59:34] <Wan6Saber> nice angle of that athEZ
[3:59:34] <%Laecerelius> Higher level = bigger number
[3:59:35] <%Idziman> Some peoples tools are curved, Plague
[3:59:36] <%mckraven> everyone in Dragon's crown is just taking the character sliders to 15
[3:59:38] <+KENTASHIRO> plague is made of big ol man meat
[3:59:38] <%doc_ock_rokc> No plauge its a specific type of hammer for shoing or something
[3:59:39] <%NopeBadguy> we're all made of meat
[3:59:42] <+sp_abadidea> the shape of those hammers is actually based somewhat on old norse depictions of Thor and Mjolnir
[3:59:44] <%BoxNavy> yea u r
[3:59:47] <Huntercd> Good lord she is stacked
[3:59:49] <%luftraumm1> you are half asleep

[3:59:51] <%BoxNavy> youre dead plague
[3:59:54] <%BoxNavy> you heard him
[3:59:57] <%NopeBadguy> if you're not made of meat then you're made of plant matter. ARE you made of plant matter
[4:00:01] <%SirGO0SE> psaUp psaUp

[4:03:05] <+sp_abadidea> If you really want to get revenge on Paige you should make her play YIIK: A Postmodern RPG. the game is so bad it makes David Cage look like a good game designer.

[4:03:15] <%depressed_skeleton> Never sleep. Stay awake
[4:03:18] <%Keyd00d> What a mystery we had

[4:03:54] <thefunkiestpunkiest> What is this, just some anime and yakuza schlock?
[4:03:55] <+jiggy_snipe> a Paige YIIK playthrough would be funny I bet
