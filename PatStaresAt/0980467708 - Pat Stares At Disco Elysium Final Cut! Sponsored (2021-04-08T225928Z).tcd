[0:05:32] <%Blackleafx> @GuildmasterAhnonay SAME
[0:05:36] <%SaiyanShoto> Personally I didn't think the AOT ending was bad. I thought it was alright. Some people are being very over the top about it though
[0:05:49] <cardamomo88> JUST DONT TALK ABOUT IT PLS
[0:05:50] <yourliteraldog> Chat is always some kind of trash can fire.
[0:05:50] <%Blackleafx> pat's twitter fights are amazing and im 100% with him on this one
[0:05:53] <%Ranryu692> I can't believe AoT ends with Guts giving Griffith a handy j

[0:06:11] <NeroInfinite> just hide chat we don't need this energy in disco time
[0:06:14] <%Blackleafx> @SaiyanShoto oh yeah a decent chunk of it is hardcore fans being angry that their pet theory didnt become real
[0:06:15] <UberKingKai> Oh boy aot
[0:06:21] <%Blackleafx> also yeah guys don't post any spoilers
[0:06:24] <noirxgwen> Reading the AOT tweets with no context is amazing lol
[0:06:27] <%ExpressNode> So I turned my Xbox SX and Halo MCC had a almost 60gb patch. My space is running low
[0:06:28] <%Blackleafx> and leave the AoT when the stream starts 4real

[0:07:45] <NeroInfinite> day 2
[0:07:45] <%Monkeyweed21> I didnt keep up with any of the theories or speculation and just casually read the chapters and yea that ending is DOGSHIT
[0:07:48] <%Blackleafx> @toolofparanoia yea
[0:07:58] <%SaiyanShoto> @Blackleafx Oooohh okay! Sorry I'm dumb lol but yeah that definitely seems to be some of what I've been seeing
[0:08:04] <%maskedsongbird> I just looked at the tweets now. Considering I stopped watching after the first season, hearing about all this dumb shit without any context is baffling, lol
[0:08:09] <%toolofparanoia> Fuck yeah!
[0:08:11] <jorniev> lets not alk about aot here please
[0:08:12] <Aydarkzero> I stopped watching AoT after the 1st season plot twist it just wasn't for me after that
[0:08:19] <DukeBlack_> Also having morgana and Ann in the party would make things easier for you.
[0:08:25] <jorniev> ITS DISCO TIME NOT MANGA TIME
[0:08:30] <%crazyspartan214> GIVE ME YOUR MONEY
[0:08:32] <+Sunriser41> the worse thing about AoT ending is not how dumb it is, but how boring it is to read it
[0:08:35] <%maskedsongbird> Man, I never get tired of these PatStaresAt intros.
[0:08:36] <%Blackleafx> @SaiyanShoto It didn't help that there was a REALLY big theory going around that I'd compare to like... Mass Effect's "Indoctrination theory" in the scope of people saying "THIS EXPLAINS EVERYTHING"

[0:13:26] <muXPerience> In L4D2 the zombies are ashy/pale so its actually not racist
[0:13:29] <quietshun> I'm fine with the ending :)
[0:13:32] <DianaTheAscian> oh yeah prob
[0:13:43] <Grimlockfly> Grimlockfly subscribed at Tier 1. They've subscribed for 16 months! Here money, good money, money money mommy milkers.
[0:13:43] <%toolofparanoia> Japan lives on islands and has had big periods of isolationism
[0:13:48] <cardamomo88> japan is very bad in that
[0:13:49] <%ExpressNode> Oh yeah I remember the RE5 shit back then
[0:13:57] <%MajorCrasher> LUL
[0:13:57] <+snausages_> It basically ended up trading in some of the same signifiers as historical racist propaganda, whether intentionally or not
[0:13:58] <%NaturalZer0> NaturalZer0 subscribed with Prime. 
[0:14:02] <%maskedsongbird> A boook from like the forties, no less.
[0:14:02] <vapidq> @quietshun it's not that bad but it did feel kinda underwhelming to be honest
[0:14:03] <%ClericOfSparda> It's a bad take, for sure
[0:14:03] <%Alazull> A very, very racist book
[0:14:08] <meatman_noplan> Like they heard about black people for the first time from a 1940's comic book.
[0:14:10] <+RowenCleric> they read Dr. Seuss
[0:14:11] <%LeRouch_the_Rebel> "Mommy, what's a black man?"
[0:14:12] <%ChanseyChild> psaCrazy
[0:14:14] <+eanscrale> They had giant masks
[0:14:14] <+OperatorPlease> best of coppitude, pat
[0:14:17] <+twohitgood> a book written by white people.
[0:14:20] <%Blackleafx> @NaturalZer0 The whole Japan Doesn't Know thing is such nonsense. Its more Japan Doesn't Care. There's some really good creators tho that have very nuanced takes on POC like Matsaru Gotsubo
[0:14:21] <marvel877> Like in an old Rudyard Kipling novel or something?
[0:14:24] <%Nekros4442> Yep
[0:14:24] <CatRidder> they watch kimba
[0:14:25] <%linSP> they threw in like one Asian guy and an Italian to mix it up
[0:14:26] <%maskofmichael> Cheer500 With all this controversy going on with all these new Animes, it just reminds me why I like simple ones like Dragon Ball. "Hey, it's a bad guy over there. Let's punch him in the face."
[0:14:30] <muXPerience> What about binary domain
[0:14:30] <%maenos2> just tune din and oh boy
[0:14:31] <%bhp_99> Especially in February
[0:14:31] <thelonechris> You've never played Grezzo 2
[0:14:33] <%Dementedpenguin> What's worse: RE5's "enemies" or that Star Trek the Next Generation Season 1 episode. Kappa
[0:14:33] <%MajorCrasher> what about Yakuza? LUL
[0:14:35] <JJ92> o god i remember the re5 stuff LOL
[0:14:37] <deviljhojho_> AH YES
[0:14:37] <marvel877> Oh, on a channel, yeah.
[0:14:38] <%SaiyanShoto> During black history month too
[0:14:38] <Aydarkzero> OH MAN
[0:14:39] <+DontTellPike> woah pat live before going to bed
[0:14:40] <illtima> That fucking scene
[0:14:42] <cardamomo88> Kappa Kappa
[0:14:43] <%toolofparanoia> xenophobia and japan are like psaDab
[0:14:45] <%maskedsongbird> Oh shit I forgot about that!
[0:14:45] <%GuildmasterAhnonay> Is RE5 more or less racist than Bioshock Infinite and/or Indigo Prophecy?
[0:14:46] <%arcielardor> Production schedule personally overseen by Canada's prime minister
[0:14:46] <%ChanseyChild> STEALING NO WAY i never knew about this
[0:14:47] <+snausages_> No it;s the scene with the tribes people chucking spears at you
[0:14:47] <+BallerSwagBro9k> @tussletoes Oh god Tintin in Congo....the author was apparently a Nazi collaborator during WW2. His paper printed propaganda for the Germans. Hes says he was forced but  HMMMMMMMM
[0:14:47] <illtima> and then you get to the swamp
[0:14:49] <yourliteraldog> OH FUCK I MISSED THAT
[0:14:49] <deviljhojho_> its the implication
[0:14:51] <%Ranryu692> Part of why Japan is so racist towards Black people is because they got a lot of it from American soldiers/media after WWII
[0:14:52] <%radda343> don't forget the spear throwing guys in masks and skirts
[0:14:55] <DracaenaLeaf> You didn't play the latest Shaq Fu on the channel right?
[0:14:56] <%ExpressNode> Oh fuck
[0:15:00] <dan_g_v> the white evil part?
[0:15:01] <+DontTellPike> DUDE this twitch integration
[0:15:02] <%SaintPyre> man I am sure glad the ending of GoT didnt ruin everyone's thoughts on the series as a whole
[0:15:03] <yourliteraldog> EVIL MISCEGENATION
[0:15:05] <%ChanseyChild> i don't play re games but i'm shook
[0:15:07] <%KeiganOfAstora> Just got here, is Pat talking about AOT?
[0:15:08] <%crazyspartan214> remember virtual fighting is a thing in Dead or Alive.
[0:15:08] <%captain_thickthighs> I just want to say seeing you Kung fu fight multiple people on Twitter verbally was the highlight of my day.
[0:15:08] <huskarl_zap> BUFF ELECTROCHEM
[0:15:09] <bakkatohri> Africa is pretty diverse. Like they have some 1st world looking cities. But they also have extremely rural areas that believe in witch craft.
[0:15:10] <devanmuse> As if the Marshland Level wasn't enough, you mean?
[0:15:12] <NeroInfinite> now anyone who says dr seuss was a racist deserves a kick to the head
[0:15:21] <%bravebravesrobin> @patstaresat gotta work for the man tonight, so will miss most of your stream, but keep on keeping on; got the game because of this play through and this dialogue is crazy, I love it Cheer500
[0:15:26] <+LordAngry> Pat, would you consider twitter getting mad at you enragement or engagement?
[0:15:29] <%Blackleafx> @BallerSwagBro9k He wasn't even just a collaborator, he was literally in the Belgian fascist party (The Rexists) prior to ww2
[0:15:33] <%Blackleafx> so he was IN there to begin with
[0:15:34] <%GuildmasterAhnonay> RACISM HYPE TRAIN
[0:15:35] <thelonechris> The ending was balls, case closed
[0:15:36] <+DontTellPike> i missed some oppinions
[0:15:40] <deviljhojho_> atack on titan had better black representation
[0:15:40] <%LeRouch_the_Rebel> But RE5 is good tho Kappa
[0:15:41] <meatman_noplan> Engragement.
[0:15:43] <%A_Mighty_Walrus> engragement
[0:15:43] <%Maids4lyfe> dr seuss changed his ways and tried to be better
[0:15:43] <%neroforte177> neroforte177 subscribed at Tier 1. They've subscribed for 15 months! wow 15 months of this shit...AND HERES TO 15 MORE!
[0:15:44] <bakkatohri> Racism get out
[0:15:44] <%Ranryu692> Engragement
[0:15:45] <%KeiganOfAstora> Glad i missed that, didn't wanna get spoiled

[0:15:50] <+pectusumbra> @bakkatohri same as america then
[0:15:50] <+OperatorPlease> no such thing as bad publicity?
[0:15:56] <%KeiganOfAstora> ENGRAGEMENT
[0:15:56] <%captain_thickthighs> enrage for a bulging ingagement
[0:15:57] <Frampis> Twitter is mad at him? for what? I don't browser Twitter a lot
[0:15:57] <Aydarkzero> peepohappy
[0:16:01] <cardamomo88> BIRD
[0:16:03] <%NaturalZer0> Don't talk about my Pipo
[0:16:07] <yourliteraldog> Dr. Suess was super racist towards the japanese for awhile he got better sorta.
[0:16:07] <@SoFarFetched> twitch chat in here might accidentally be jackassses in here and spoil it.
[0:16:09] <Ravioli_Ronin> Bait for the clicks
[0:16:10] <%valriot> Its really not like that but still. People like to go "I saw a thing, therefore it wants me to also feel that way", when its just a story tbh
[0:16:13] <Aydarkzero> accurate
[0:16:13] <muXPerience> twitter just doesn't seem to be the place for [psot vobes
[0:16:15] <%Maids4lyfe> LUL
[0:16:15] <%Alazull> So you're telling me they don't stick the landing?
[0:16:16] <%KeiganOfAstora> That's a spoiler
[0:16:18] <%za7az> LUL
[0:16:18] <DiagunAquila> its bit as bad as GOT but oof
[0:16:20] <%Dementedpenguin> If you hate that about RE5, never play Greendog for the Sega Genesis. OOF, that game. LUL
[0:16:23] <CatRidder> have you finish the anime?
[0:16:24] <deviljhojho_> it makes me feel emoshuns
[0:16:25] <+kewlmyc> I agree somewhat.
[0:16:30] <+eanscrale> Oh boy so all that subtext turned into REAL text.
[0:16:30] <%Nekros4442> It had to flub somewhere right?
[0:16:31] <%KeiganOfAstora> Did you watch the anime yet?
[0:16:34] <nevan_44> LUL
[0:16:35] <+DontTellPike> how long this been up?
[0:16:37] <%SaiyanShoto> Now we wait a year for Wollie's take
[0:16:40] <dark_kebabs> is anything that ends on 'oT' bad i.e. GoT and now AoT?
[0:16:42] <%KeiganOfAstora> Watch the anime so you guys can discuss it tomorrow
[0:16:47] <bakkatohri> @pectusumbra Yeah, kinda. But Africa has been exploited for resources a lot. Even now, companies still use Africans for slave labor.
[0:16:49] <@SoFarFetched> Pat probably watched the anime by people sending him screenshots going "HEY DID YOU SEE THIS?"
[0:16:50] <%walternatorz> did Gief start applying the cow lotion to his feet?
[0:16:58] <%captain_thickthighs> the synopsis is it's okay if you do it for freindship
[0:17:00] <%KeiganOfAstora> Woolie's gonna wait until Part 2? He's not even gonna watch all of Part 1?
[0:17:00] <%Blackleafx> @dark_kebabs Ocarina of Time?
[0:17:03] <+Sunriser41> AoT ending did had big GoT ending energy

[0:18:22] <%KeiganOfAstora> I don't wanna get spoiled fuck this
[0:18:24] <%Blackleafx> The comparison you made on twitter to it was really apt
[0:18:25] <%Alazull> God that was so disappointing
[0:18:26] <Sol_Install> GoT
[0:18:26] <+OperatorPlease> game of thrones level?
[0:18:27] <%Tuna_Can_0> can people not shut the fuck up??
[0:18:27] <marvel877> HIMYM
[0:18:27] <%ExpressNode> You know what else has a bad ending Game of Thrones
[0:18:29] <%Daxalog> Dropped the ball? It smashed it down.
[0:18:29] <%caramelatte1> yeee.....
[0:18:30] <cardamomo88> NEVER 4GET ¡¡
[0:18:31] <%takotoots> FeelsBadMan yeah
[0:18:31] <yourliteraldog> Legend Galactica Heros is real shit
[0:18:34] <%Nekros4442> That is a nice combination of adjectives
[0:18:35] <DiagunAquila> got?
[0:18:35] <@SoFarFetched> We're here to watch Disco Elysium, NOT discuss the ending of AOT.
[0:18:35] <%Alazull> The ball is dropped in the last episode
[0:18:37] <muddiestpath> bbunsUhoh
[0:18:39] <%BioHunter> ttgl ending sucked
[0:18:39] <Rellim80> Heroes, season 3+
[0:18:41] <DiagunAquila> oh watched
[0:18:41] <$Ziegsy> Heroes shat the bed super hard
[0:18:41] <yourliteraldog> It ENDS SUPER BAD
[0:18:42] <+temporaryplaceholder> I just got here, is this Pat's first crack at Disco Elysium?
[0:18:42] <Aydarkzero> wow
[0:18:42] <Picia000123> I thought it was fine
[0:18:43] <%ArtoriasTheTrenchfighter> Honestly, after what happened last time, I wouldn't be against emote only chat, especially considering  the integration poll is separate from chat.
[0:18:44] <Blank9> a fumble at 1st and 1 to goal
[0:18:46] <deviljhojho_> that just makes it funnier
[0:18:48] <+Sunriser41> AoT is pretty much that
[0:18:50] <$RealThiele> BSG falls apart similar to GoT in speed
[0:18:51] <Devbob98> Himym is still my hardest bad ending
[0:18:51] <%NastiCrimeboy> barrBQ barrFwoosh barrBurn
[0:18:53] <+OperatorPlease> @sofarfetched we are now
[0:18:55] <olwe123> isnt it like the last 2 or 3
[0:18:56] <cardamomo88> I WAS LAUGHING SO HARD AT THE END
[0:19:00] <yourliteraldog> Stop watching at the 2nd to last episode
[0:19:02] <DirtyMiser> People will only talk about AoT today
[0:19:06] <rekinom> Dexter as well, right till the end
[0:19:07] <%ssjklyco> You know what else falls apart? GoT
[0:19:10] <+polothegreatest> not like monster ending
[0:19:14] <%dalmek> tripping over the finish line off of a cliff
[0:19:15] <+bugz_munny> deep space 9 too
[0:19:16] <jorniev> disagree
[0:19:20] <%Valdorick> It was ALWAYS a 0.
[0:19:21] <Picia000123> I disagree, but eh
[0:19:22] <%arcielardor> Joss Wheden is a hack. an unbelievably lucky hack
[0:19:24] <TrollKing96> Should all writers just take as long as Tolkien did to write his stories?
[0:19:26] <keatiestofthegribbles> Hey pat
[0:19:27] <PartyFavors> you know what else falls apart?
[0:19:31] <PartyFavors> Things Fall Apart
[0:19:32] <thelonechris> Season 3 of Kipo
[0:19:35] <%caramelatte1> All because one asshole became like a scientologist or something and forced the studio to adapt or something?
[0:19:37] <deviljhojho_> THATS RIGHT
[0:19:37] <%neroforte177> haunting at hill manor is very similar
[0:19:40] <%bravebravesrobin> Baltar's speech about God still gives me chills; still one of the best sci-fi shows of all time
[0:19:43] <deviljhojho_> ITS WRONG FOR IT TO EVEN EXIST
[0:19:44] <Ravioli_Ronin> If you don’t have a good ending planned out, just don’t make the show/content
[0:19:45] <deviljhojho_> oh
[0:19:45] <+Mucmaster> Battle Star Galactica, wut if ur mum waz a cyloid
[0:19:46] <%toolofparanoia> Kinda glad i hopped off that train early on.
[0:19:47] <bakkatohri> It's hard to make an ending I guess. You have to ~really~ build up to an ending. Knowing you're near the end while never reaching the actual end can be fatiguing.
[0:19:48] <NeroInfinite> oh yeah bstg can be blamed on the writers strike that happened at the same time
[0:19:51] <huskarl_zap> return to monke
[0:19:51] <%Ranryu692> just like Death Note!
[0:19:55] <agmoney26> Heyyy
[0:19:56] <%ChanseyChild> @trollking96 only if they're good
[0:20:00] <$RealThiele> Say no to robosexualism
[0:20:01] <+mczarklesby> Oh yeah cause of the stars.
[0:20:01] <cardamomo88> JUST LIKE HIMYM
[0:20:07] <jorniev> what is he talking about now?
[0:20:10] <+twohitgood> @ranryu692 death note wasn't intended to end that way.
[0:20:11] <yourliteraldog> Ancient Aliens all the way down
[0:20:13] <+eanscrale> wait didn't the last season happen just after the writer's strike ended
[0:20:18] <%maskofmichael> Has there ever been a show that falls apart on purpose? Like the plot is that it falls apart?
[0:20:19] <%toolofparanoia> Its been a slog trying to finish season 7 of TNG
[0:20:21] <%JoshManVGH> Is it better for a show to have 5 episodes of just shitting itself, or to instantly sublimate into nothing in the last 10 minutes?
[0:20:21] <Picia000123> @jorniev Attack on Titan
[0:20:23] <Virokwet> almost like its fiction
[0:20:26] <%Dementedpenguin> @jorniev battlestar galactica
[0:20:28] <yourliteraldog> Makes no fucking sense
[0:20:31] <%maskofmichael> Choo Chooo HypeRIP
[0:20:34] <%elhafnero> the authors so young
[0:20:34] <nomos42> Damn my stream is lagging balls today postingSad
[0:20:35] <keatiestofthegribbles> Scientolgy killed tom cruise
[0:20:38] <%Starotter70> Ahh
[0:20:38] <%bravebravesrobin> @patstaresat LOST ending is still worse; I still get violently angry thinking about it
[0:20:40] <muXPerience> MFers always want to jump to the epilogue. What about the shitty ending going on right now?
[0:20:40] <%ShitLord> uhoh
[0:20:40] <%ChanseyChild> oh no not lost
[0:20:41] <+bugz_munny> Lost was eh
[0:20:45] <%Starotter70> Yeah, Lost flopped
[0:20:45] <+bugz_munny> LOST WAS NOT DEXTER THO
[0:20:46] <%Tuna_Can_0> even saying an ending is [blank] is a fucking spoiler
[0:20:47] <exack> I binged Lost to catch up to the final season. Bad idea
[0:20:48] <+bugz_munny> WOOF
[0:20:48] <+JustToWatch> ENDINGS ARE HARD
[0:20:49] <%Ranryu692> the only episode I ever watched of LOST was the final episode
[0:20:49] <%SaiyanShoto> Endings are tough
[0:20:51] <iosephe> They all just fall apart
[0:20:54] <%ExpressNode> Apparently TV is a life waster
[0:20:55] <%caramelatte1> Dexter you just cut the last 5 minutes and its just great
[0:20:56] <%walternatorz> no show ever has an idea on how to end
[0:20:56] <%ChanseyChild> you know what tanked too?? grey's anatomy...
[0:20:57] <TrollKing96> @PatStaresAt Should all writers just take as long as Tolkien did to write his stories?
[0:20:57] <Aydarkzero> NICE
[0:20:58] <+temporaryplaceholder> I forgot about HIMYM :C
[0:20:59] <+Sunriser41> Lost droped the ball way before the ending, the ending was boring, not bad
[0:21:00] <$RealThiele> an early con someone asked if the ending was what it was and writers were like NAH
[0:21:00] <+bustawof> how I met your mother was bs
[0:21:01] <keatiestofthegribbles> AOT?
[0:21:01] <%maenos2> i was talking with a friend about what anime/manga actually stuck their ending and we didn't come up with many
[0:21:02] <%Maids4lyfe> How I Met Your Mother was fucking shit
[0:21:03] <%Grimlockfly> The Shield ends great
[0:21:03] <%MajorCrasher> YEP
[0:21:06] <%captain_thickthighs> maybe shows just need to end
[0:21:06] <meatman_noplan> The only show I 'member that closed really well was Breaking Bad.
[0:21:06] <%Alazull> @PatStaresAt I seem to remember hearing that BSG got cut shorter than they thought it would so those last five episodes were them trying desperately to end it and just not sticking the landing
[0:21:06] <DukeBlack_> MK2
[0:21:06] <%LeRouch_the_Rebel> One Piece has an answer, thank fuck
[0:21:07] <%crazyspartan214> PLOT
[0:21:07] <cardamomo88> lost ending was bad but at lest was not boring
[0:21:07] <+murilo182x> A bad ending can ruin an entire series
[0:21:08] <jorniev> IS HE talking about GOT now?
[0:21:08] <iosephe> It all comes tumbling down, tumbling down, tumbling dowwn
[0:21:10] <+temporaryplaceholder> The Good Place had possibly the best ending I've ever seen
[0:21:12] <+bugz_munny> Dexter legitimately was painful though
[0:21:15] <vilecrois> just like my life
[0:21:16] <%Grimlockfly> Ploooooot
[0:21:17] <%toolofparanoia> Seinfeld rules : make a show about nothing
[0:21:17] <dizimous> This is going to be kingdom hearts, mark my words
[0:21:17] <$Unholyfanclub> DEXTER ending was shit
[0:21:19] <+Mucmaster> HIMYM's problem is the opposite, they stuck to their original idea too hard
[0:21:20] <%captain_thickthighs> we have lifespans why not tv?
[0:21:20] <yourliteraldog> Or Ancient  [Blanks] did it.
[0:21:20] <thelonechris> The greatest TV show ending was Breaking Bad
[0:21:21] <%ClericOfSparda> yeah but everyone knew that since season 2
[0:21:22] <%linSP> Just don’t watch shows ever like me and never be upset
[0:21:23] <+temporaryplaceholder> The Good Place S tier ending
[0:21:24] <%JoshManVGH> or they had a plan but the studio gave more monies for more seasons that weren't really there.
[0:21:24] <%Valdorick> Step 1 - make an ending. Step 2 - work backwards. Step 3 - It will never get greenlit, wait fuck
[0:21:26] <$RealThiele> true blood
[0:21:29] <%NaturalZer0> Who would've thought that endings would suck if the writer didn't even have an idea of what it was gonna be when they started the story?
[0:21:31] <jorniev> SEINFEILD
[0:21:31] <ChungusQuest> yeah it did
[0:21:32] <deviljhojho_> "i'd rather have nothing"
[0:21:34] <AvroEltz> I just wish better call saul doesnt end up like GOT or something like this
[0:21:36] <thelonechris> It broke good
[0:21:36] <+bugz_munny> Breaking Bad is so good
[0:21:36] <%GuildmasterAhnonay> Like Jojo, but Araki never pretends he has an idea
[0:21:37] <Aydarkzero> Breaking Bad ended real good
[0:21:40] <+murilo182x> Breaking Bad and White Collar are the only two good endings I can think of tbh
[0:21:41] <%OfficioPrefectusCorgi> Or Cut to Black
[0:21:41] <+bugz_munny> good end
[0:21:42] <bakkatohri> I haven't watched Call Saul in a long time.
[0:21:42] <+DrProfW> How i met your mother suffered from writing the ending 7 seasons before the show ended and having to stick to it
[0:21:43] <bigstupidjellyfish1337> lost had a 3 season arc and then ABC went NAH STRETCH IT THO
[0:21:45] <rekinom> Dexter was awful because the books ending was right there
[0:21:45] <deviljhojho_> you should just like things that never end like me
[0:21:47] <+eanscrale> it was cause they got cancelled right before becoming super popular
[0:21:52] <+BallerSwagBro9k> BETTER CALL SAUL WILL HOPEFULLY END WELL TOO
[0:21:55] <grimm_hatter> grimm_hatter is gifting 1 Tier 1 Subs to PatStaresAt's community! They've gifted a total of 1 in the channel! 
[0:21:55] <%Tuna_Can_0> no one cares
[0:21:56] <grimm_hatter> grimm_hatter gifted a Tier 1 sub to Mucmaster! 
[0:21:58] <jorniev> I disagree
[0:22:01] <%s_xylocalsingles> THATS A LIE
[0:22:01] <Aydarkzero> ready for Walking Dead ending?
[0:22:03] <%toolofparanoia> Breaking Bad was the show I finished and actually clapped
[0:22:03] <deviljhojho_> its still worth a watch you baffoon
[0:22:06] <+purps26> Sopranos is the only 10/10 ending to a long running show
[0:22:07] <ThighsSupreme> AOT ending is just sooo poorly written.
[0:22:09] <Chatterbox1991> Yeah but Christa tho
[0:22:09] <aeonicvector> AoT season 1 was fun atleast, but i didnt like anything after that
[0:22:09] <%Mucmaster> Thanks grimm_hatter
[0:22:13] <keatiestofthegribbles> Avatar ended well Korra the other hand
[0:22:15] <%NaturalZer0> @Aydarkzero Is TWD finally ending?
[0:22:15] <Picia000123> Attack on Titan overall is pretty good
[0:22:17] <%Nekros4442> AoT just failed on that last step to bring everything together
[0:22:19] <meatman_noplan> Sopranos is very strong oto
[0:22:19] <$Unholyfanclub> Walking dead will never end lol
[0:22:21] <meatman_noplan> too*
[0:22:22] <DiksieNormis> I edited together my own ending for Aot
[0:22:22] <%valriot> What?
[0:22:28] <Sol_Install> AoT has been a fun ride till the fucking end ride
[0:22:28] <DianaTheAscian> I stopped caring back when season 1 came out
[0:22:30] <+Sunriser41> the basement reveal was actually pretty good
[0:22:31] <deviljhojho_> its not GOT tier
[0:22:31] <yourliteraldog> Its good but it has terrible moral lesson.
[0:22:32] <+murilo182x> Korra was a mess from the start
[0:22:32] <Aydarkzero> @NaturalZer0 Auguest this year
[0:22:35] <%toolofparanoia> The walking dead has become a walker unto itself
[0:22:35] <%Monkeyweed21> @PatStaresAt Its literally the last like 3 chapters just acitvely shit the bed
[0:22:35] <%maskedsongbird> cheer500 Hobocop Harry may be a fuckup, but his handlebar mustache/beard is glorious and I feel like it's important we acknowledge this. Also, thanks for doing your thing Pat--been watching since I was 14 (A LITERAL CHILD) and you helped get me through some shit.
[0:22:36] <%captain_thickthighs> you mean the not jews?

[0:22:39] <%Alazull> @PatStaresAt At least we found out what was in that damn basement right?
[0:22:41] <$Ziegsy> Hey chat, did they ever animate the scene with the dogs and the little girl, no spoilers, just ye or ne
[0:22:43] <exack> The official TL is slightly better than the fan one. Still not great though
[0:22:47] <%kknutson4> FMA had a great ending
[0:22:53] <+bugz_munny> Fuck UPS too

[0:23:45] <DianaTheAscian> @PatStaresAt is that not from the burn?

[0:23:47] <%ssjklyco> My arm is still sore a bit

[0:29:31] <greencapps> glad the intros are 30 minutes long cause I completely forgot about the stream and don't want to miss any of the game
[0:29:35] <bakkatohri> COVID is surging like a mofo in certain places in Canada.
[0:29:38] <%Valdorick> Why would anyone lie of admission to you?
[0:29:40] <%Alazull> Everyone has told you or you haven't listened
[0:29:41] <Aydarkzero> all those comments about healing weren't a joke
[0:29:45] <%Nekros4442> The only job that isnt stressful is DPS
[0:29:45] <%LeRouch_the_Rebel> Healing is the most rewarding thing because of the stress
[0:29:48] <%valriot> Healing is easy, until its not
[0:29:48] <tanarath> Oh, it IS
[0:29:50] <%LeRouch_the_Rebel> cmonBruh
[0:29:50] <jorkoal> yesss did I make it before the game started?
[0:29:52] <meatman_noplan> Yo Shadowbringer's story is so good
[0:29:53] <%GrayMatterMiner> healing is omega stress, wtf is this person talking about lol
[0:29:53] <%A_Mighty_Walrus> my partner just started healing and I've never heard her shout so much
[0:29:55] <+GrayFox2510> It is... until it stops being and you hate everyone and everything.
[0:29:55] <+Gespens> Only a DPS Main would tell you that healing isn't stressful
[0:30:00] <%AEUG_Ace_Kamille> Everyone warned you.
[0:30:03] <+bugz_munny> healing goes from stressful to annoying
[0:30:09] <%GrayMatterMiner> super true
[0:30:11] <Garry_Guyface> Real Life told you healing is stressful, look at all the nurse strikes
[0:30:13] <thelonechris> Healing requires work
[0:30:13] <%valriot> "Oh... they didnt move. Oh no"
[0:30:13] <+bugz_munny> WHY AM I HEALING YOU
[0:30:17] <$RealThiele> healer adjust
[0:30:17] <Aydarkzero> just heal your team 4Head
[0:30:20] <notsoy> LMAO anybody who can tell you anything about MMORPGs will tell you healing is stressful as fuck
[0:30:21] <yourliteraldog> Healing is stressful only because other people are stupid
[0:30:22] <DianaTheAscian> I actually don't find it very stressful most of the time
[0:30:23] <%captain_thickthighs> healing is always stressful imagine what a doctor's got to go through and they might not even be specked right
[0:30:23] <%ExpressNode> Not unless your old, healing gets harder
[0:30:23] <tanarath> And when it's not, IT'S NOT
[0:30:24] <%maskedsongbird> Makes me wonder why anyone would voluntarily be healer
[0:30:25] <sirtommygunn> healing is either extremely stressful or boring, no inbetween
[0:30:26] <%SaintPyre> I went from DRG to DNC to AST -- my stress went from 0 to 0 to 100
[0:30:28] <JJ92> healing is stressful in savage raids in ff14 :(
[0:30:30] <aiutare47> @garry_guyface Yeet
[0:30:40] <devanmuse> Healing is easy. just ask the least stressed out people in the world: DOCTORS

[0:30:58] <thelonechris> Didn't Goku blow up like 5 earths or something?
[0:30:58] <%TheMattman1313> "Hey it's bad guy over there, let's punch him in the face IN #) EPISODES"
[0:30:58] <keatiestofthegribbles> MR POPO
[0:30:58] <Aeroallways> there was so much weird shit in dragon ball
[0:30:59] <%neroforte177> don't shoot that man isn't Black
[0:30:59] <+DrProfW> and the existence of mr popo was the second
[0:31:00] <%Higure_yoru> Healing is like babystitting antimaskers in a walmart
[0:31:00] <jorniev> Dragon ball gt fucking sucked
[0:31:01] <notsoy> HOLD YOUR FIRE, THIS MAN ISN'T BLACK
[0:31:01] <%cache_22> Mr. Popo monkaS
[0:31:07] <+gimmickypizza> The blackface
[0:31:08] <%neroforte177> mr. popo
[0:31:14] <+JaseAdrift> Then wanted Gohan to be the MC
[0:31:14] <Aydarkzero> now he sucks!
[0:31:16] <DukeBlack_> second one isn't true
[0:31:17] <%valriot> EVERYONE WAS SUPER WRONG
[0:31:17] <$Unholyfanclub> mr. popo
[0:31:19] <%Valdorick> Dragon Ball GT is also a pretty big controversy.
[0:31:20] <bakkatohri> Dragon Ball is kinda one dimensional when it comes to stories anyway, right?
[0:31:21] <+ReallyBigRocks> The fuckin backdown
[0:31:22] <+DontTellPike> what a dragoon sphere?
[0:31:23] <%ssjklyco> Picollo best father
[0:31:24] <+DrProfW> I like the saiyaman saga. sue me
[0:31:24] <+JaseAdrift> GOHAN FUCKING SUCKS
[0:31:24] <cardamomo88> NotLikeThis
[0:31:24] <%GrayMatterMiner> "you peaked"
[0:31:24] <%GarbageQueenEllie> Loved Plague's vid on Gohan
[0:31:26] <%Tuna_Can_0> dbz sucks
[0:31:27] <%Alazull> Well then here's another Goku you fucks
[0:31:30] <+Faultlined> Krillan for main character
[0:31:32] <%bhp_99> bro ngl, I dont like mystic gohan
[0:31:32] <ChungusQuest> The Z-Sword LUL
[0:31:32] <+shaidot> Gohan would've been a bteer MC
[0:31:33] <yourliteraldog> Gohan rules Mexico is correct in this matter
[0:31:34] <%TheWinged7> donnt forget that he foorgot launch
[0:31:35] <+pectusumbra> "It wasn't me that was wrong. It was the world!"
[0:31:36] <%Dementedpenguin> Gohan became a fucking joke after his fight with Cell NotLikeThis
[0:31:37] <%maskedsongbird> I'd say I don't remember this DBZ controversy, but I'm also 25, so I was probably too young at the time tonotice it, lol
[0:31:37] <+eanscrale> They should've let him stop, let's be real
[0:31:41] <+RowenCleric> I wanted Gohan and Picollo as mc
[0:31:41] <jorniev> gohan peaked in highschool
[0:31:47] <marvel877> And then he went home to be a family man.
[0:31:48] <+Jiggisnipe> I don't think the 2nd one is true, I think he always wanted Goku
[0:31:48] <Zero_Jacks> lytBADMAN im even better then gohan
[0:31:49] <%captain_thickthighs> don't forget the chibi moon 🐎
[0:31:58] <Mr_Rakjo> GT was a reeeeee fest @PatStaresAt
[0:32:04] <+Ne0nF0xx> just a reminder that super saiyans have yellow hair cuz toriyama was too lazy to color
[0:32:10] <DirtyMiser> Gohan is just an insecure dad now
[0:32:15] <bakkatohri> I remember being bored of GT because of the lack of fights.
[0:32:16] <sirtommygunn> GT wasn't that bad in retrospect
[0:32:17] <premmylive> all the non-saiyan characters sucking is basically just more Overfocus on Goku
[0:32:18] <%GarbageQueenEllie> Gohan only sucks because him sucking was a self-fulfilling prophecy
[0:32:27] <+rottingpastry> don't let it set in
[0:32:28] <%AncelDeLambert> hmm, this cannot be the Songbird I know, there's not enough mention of being horny for Lady Dimitrescu
[0:32:29] <keatiestofthegribbles> Naruto had a perfect end but noo Boruto
[0:32:31] <sirtommygunn> not as good as Z but it had some good stuff
[0:32:40] <meatman_noplan> You need to be in pain, first.
[0:32:41] <%walternatorz> Pat, that' just your face.
[0:32:42] <mike2hands> Make a tien yamcha and krillin super hero adventures you cowards
[0:32:44] <%NaturalZer0> Good enough, lol
[0:32:44] <DianaTheAscian> he also forgot saiyans have tails
[0:32:44] <bakkatohri> The original Dragon Ball series is better than everything that came after it.

[0:38:45] <bakkatohri> New Cuno VA vs Old Cuno VA: Who wins?
[0:38:46] <NeroInfinite> Ya gotta get him amphetamines.
[0:38:48] <jorniev> did he check the intercomunicator in the door?
[0:38:49] <%Blackleafx> I forgot you had failed to assert dominance
[0:38:51] <TrollKing96> Does this game have a time limit or just a day/night cycle?
[0:38:52] <ingman112> Nah it’s the crime scene
[0:38:52] <%dalmek> Cuno gives no free information. Cuno requires the Drugs
[0:38:53] <huskarl_zap> I got the body down but kim took it. dont know how pat got it in the fridge
[0:38:56] <$RealThiele> one guy remix

[0:39:10] <yourliteraldog> Let that kid od on adderall
[0:39:12] <jorniev> @TrollKing96 like 10 days
[0:39:12] <sirtommygunn> new Cuno is more tolerable and thus a less good portrayal of this trash child
[0:39:13] <%GarbageQueenEllie> Peanuts/Almonds are a good side w/ a sandwich, I must say
[0:39:20] <FlamingoJazz> SourPls
[0:39:26] <+Burdenslo> Has pat gone hobo cop?
[0:39:28] <%Tuna_Can_0> if you're gunna give advice, at least be right atpCap
[0:39:29] <honterthompson> @TrollKing96 time-of-day affects what things are available, and you can wait too long to do quests, but the only difference if you take too long is your dream dialogue starts looping
[0:39:32] <%Blackleafx> @RealThiele In my defense I had forgotten pat failed the red check against him. But yea, psa1guy
[0:39:38] <meatman_noplan> SourPls
[0:39:46] <%maskedsongbird> @Blackleafx Cuno's too good for anti-rad hallucinogens but he'll take a pack of cigs? lol
[0:39:49] <MonsieurHedge> pat has fully embaced Hobo Cop
[0:39:49] <jorniev> this quest is awesome

[0:39:59] <%AEUG_Ace_Kamille> Is Garte's voice different?
[0:40:08] <%dork_doggler> Oh shit this one is good
[0:40:09] <%Blackleafx> @AEUG_Ace_Kamille yea
[0:40:11] <jorniev> @AEUG_Ace_Kamille i hope not
[0:40:21] <%maskedsongbird> I like Lena's voice. It's actually kinda soothing.
[0:40:24] <bakkatohri> I don't think I noticed Garte had voice lines.
[0:40:32] <%GarbageQueenEllie> This questline is fantastic, btw.
[0:40:33] <%Valdorick> SHE FUCK'N
[0:40:35] <+DontTellPike> oak?
[0:40:36] <%Blackleafx> @Blackleafx I think its just that he had a bad trip with the hallucinogens
[0:40:45] <Giztech> She did it. she is so sus
[0:40:51] <%AEUG_Ace_Kamille> It's kinda similar but different enough. I preferred Lena's old voice for sure though.
[0:41:04] <%asgard147> aw limesAw
[0:41:04] <Aydarkzero> the voice acting in this is really solid
[0:41:08] <+DontTellPike> best gir
[0:41:09] <%GarbageQueenEllie> @Giztech Man, I WISH
[0:41:13] <honterthompson> Kim has the most gentle, reassuring voice <33
[0:41:14] <meatman_noplan> Kim's up there for one of my fave RPG homies
[0:41:15] <%maskedsongbird> Garte's original VO always sounded like he was about to fall asleep to me. I think the new voice is an improvement.
[0:41:23] <Paciboyy> ooh did i miss the cryptozoology talk?? bummer
[0:41:27] <%maskedsongbird> @Blackleafx That makes sense.
[0:41:28] <sirtommygunn> yeah the voice acting is really good considering how god damn much of it they had to do
[0:41:34] <swordfi> The lizard brain voice being used for skills sounds so good
[0:41:41] <cardamomo88> oh lest find him
[0:41:57] <%AEUG_Ace_Kamille> @maskedsongbird I think that's why I liked it. He felt right for his job.

[0:54:11] <kazadaz> Yeah oof
[0:54:12] <user_naim> yup
[0:54:12] <bakkatohri> I remember that.

[0:54:17] <%DakotaMacDoodle> yeah
[0:54:17] <MrStarsAct> oh god, why remind me of that

[0:54:19] <%SveriSageAdvice> oh god i remember that scene
[0:54:19] <sirtommygunn> i have not
[0:54:21] <DianaTheAscian> ?
[0:54:22] <%JusTTheGuyYouNeed> that movie was weird
[0:54:23] <+PkSilent01> @vilecrois (soon to be)Racist Communist Hobo Art cop
[0:54:23] <%ssjklyco> The movie seems too fart smelly. so I haven't seen it
[0:54:30] <+LittleCinders> One of my favorites, and ooof that scene
[0:54:37] <sirtommygunn> is it that you can't be a pilot with certain types of colorblindness?
[0:54:40] <%Blackleafx> something-Sunshine?
[0:54:41] <%AEUG_Ace_Kamille> @ssjklyco Also in this exact same boat.
[0:54:55] <cubelock555> has he spoken to joyce yet ?
[0:55:05] <%GarbageQueenEllie> What is it with me and wanting to befriend all the chatty old ladies?!
[0:55:07] <+Gespens> iirc 20/20 is barely passing
[0:55:08] <NeroInfinite> Perfect vison, and perfect hearing too.
[0:55:09] <%king_wragles> Perfect vision and no head injuries
[0:55:09] <+ReallyBigRocks> 20/20 is just normal vision
[0:55:10] <%Blackleafx> @cubelock555 Not in this playthrough
[0:55:10] <aiutare47> depends on the flight I think
[0:55:12] <%Valdorick> Not knowing the difference between Ocean Blue and Sky Blue is BAD
[0:55:17] <%toolofparanoia> Are glasses allowed?
[0:55:22] <%LeiaSkynoober> Little Miss Sunshine
[0:55:24] <aiutare47> I thought helo crews could have correctives
[0:55:25] <%caramelatte1> like to be an astronaut gotta be in perfect health
[0:55:25] <%king_wragles> No
[0:55:30] <%Monkeyweed21> pressing the green or red button is literally a matter of life or death
[0:55:32] <%snow_bush> You also can't be too tall.
[0:55:33] <%Blackleafx> @LeiaSkynoober ty
[0:55:33] <OmegaDragonR2> @Valdorick yeah makes sense
[0:55:35] <Chatterbox1991> @PatStaresAt  astronauts have similarly strict criteria
[0:55:40] <yourliteraldog> In the states they giver you super lasik if the Air Force really wants you
[0:55:47] <%valcheese> False; not for RCAF, you can have laser eye. Just not jets
[0:55:53] <%GarbageQueenEllie> Could you get a regular pilot's license w/o perfect vision?
[0:56:00] <Ravioli_Ronin> We’ve had astronauts with glasses
[0:56:05] <%maskedsongbird> @PatStaresAt Correction: you can't be a *fighter* pilot without 20/20 vision. You can still fly transport/cargo carriers and gunships. Although that's just the USAF--maybe the Canadian equivalent has different standards?
[0:56:09] <%asgard147> SourPls
[0:56:09] <+RealMichaelPhelps> who is the narrator voice actor
[0:56:11] <%AEUG_Ace_Kamille> @GarbageQueenEllie Yes, but you have to be good enough.
[0:56:12] <+RealMichaelPhelps> guys killing it
[0:56:14] <OmegaDragonR2> cant have your airmen mistaking a bird for a plane
[0:56:14] <%Agami23> have you seen that interview with an astronaut who keeps dropping shit because he is used to zero G?
[0:56:15] <vilecrois> they just dont want you to crash their billion dollar gadgets, be honest
[0:56:20] <aiutare47> @GarbageQueenEllie I believe so
[0:56:22] <%heartlesshealer> Looking it up and that little miss sunshine clip is just wow
[0:56:24] <Chatterbox1991> To say nothing about long term therapy for gravety readjustment after spending a year in 0 g

[0:57:05] <+Jeshk0> I think the Revochalian dating scene is in general very rough
[0:57:05] <%AEUG_Ace_Kamille> Depending on the license you go for, the requirements change. I'm going to apply and I wear glasses.

[0:57:34] <%linSP> imagine dealing with horny people
[0:57:35] <%bravebravesrobin> I hate dating apps...
[0:57:37] <%maskedsongbird> I used to want to be a fighter pilot when I was little, then my vision went to shit. That's the only reason I know the cargo carrier thing. 'Course then I tried AFROTC in college. Ultimately glad I didn't follow through, I think. Not made for the military.
[0:57:37] <%Agami23> never touched it, but watched someone who uses it, pretty funny to see

[1:29:41] <+twohitgood> i'd expect stepping up to him is what he wants since he's lying about the murder.
[1:29:41] <%OrangeMDT> you should probably go
[1:29:42] <%Blackleafx> ASSERT AUTHORITY
[1:29:43] <ingman112> Take a shot
[1:29:44] <%Mucmaster> I can't remember if you can back down from 7 or not
[1:29:47] <iosephe> nice
[1:29:47] <devanmuse> I'm convinced option 7 will just result in a dead end
[1:29:49] <honterthompson> I managed to fumble this interaction so bad on my first playthrough that Harry pulled out his gun and threatened to kill himself unless they gave him answers @PatStaresAt
[1:29:49] <AvroEltz> pat, they arent fucking around

[1:31:10] <NeroInfinite> Still ain't talked abot the bullet
[1:31:11] <Yakobro> pat I don't think a boost would help
[1:31:12] <$Futurecity10> Boots will help with authority

[1:31:14] <reonome> do that later its a red check
[1:31:15] <%torusendor> You need to do other shit first
[1:31:15] <%metalicblackcherry> a boost won't really help
[1:31:16] <Hoodywolf> hes tempted lool
[1:31:19] <ZComiX> Sad
[1:31:19] <+l0rd_anoos> not a fan of those odds lmao
[1:31:21] <kazadaz> you should change like half your clothes before you try any AUTH checks
[1:31:25] <+mczarklesby> NO
[1:31:27] <Ravioli_Ronin> BOOST
[1:31:29] <%toolofparanoia> MIGHTY
[1:31:29] <%Mucmaster> You can take off the notepad to get more authority
[1:31:35] <penitentpendant> Make sure to take off equipment that lowers your AUTH if you're going to do that
[1:31:48] <%GarbageQueenEllie> I love how you can legit wardrobe change to pass checks
[1:31:49] <%walternatorz> it checks out
[1:31:50] <%maskedsongbird> What kind of answer is that?
[1:31:50] <%torusendor> Smart man
[1:31:58] <%AncelDeLambert> sure would be a shame if there was a bullet with the name "Titus" written on it RIGHT FUCKING NOW HERE IN MY GUN, YOU SMUG FUCKWIT
[1:32:05] <penitentpendant> Speaking of Evidence: OBJECTION
[1:32:10] <sirtommygunn> this is a good idea
[1:32:23] <%MajorCrasher> LUL
[1:32:30] <+twohitgood> like a starbucks
[1:32:35] <+JustToWatch> BUT WHAT IF THOUGH
[1:32:43] <kazadaz> If you roll Double Ones you're guaranteed to fail; if you roll Double Sixes you're guaranteed to succeed.  So, the odds of every check never go below 3% or above 97%
[1:32:44] <Devbob98> Like homer
[1:32:59] <%Mendin> Is that Scout TF2?

[1:33:18] <penitentpendant> Bonus towards AUTH gained
[1:33:31] <chainsaw105> do we have authority boosting gear?
[1:33:32] <%GarbageQueenEllie> Put on your DOM GEAR
[1:33:33] <televisedrevolting> Put on some Authority Clothes
[1:33:39] <%Blackleafx> Authority -2
[1:33:40] <%Blackleafx> thatll do it
[1:33:42] <vapidq> it's a white check, you can always retry it later
[1:33:43] <jorniev> there are still clues to find and make the case stronger
[1:33:44] <kazadaz> Maybe the copp's just really good at HIS job
[1:33:44] <%walternatorz> are you going to take the bottle from his hands?...
[1:33:47] <sirtommygunn> There's only so much you can do as a defense attorney when your starting position is "yes these 7 men committed a murder and they admit it"
[1:33:51] <penitentpendant> Max dem stats

[1:34:28] <huskarl_zap> hit that cocaine
[1:34:31] <Blank9> could take the ledger off
[1:34:32] <aiutare47> @sirtommygunn It is a bit easier when theres no police to arrest you
[1:34:34] <+marlborored5> shoot him, that'll stablish autority Kappa
[1:34:36] <honterthompson> @sirtommygunn There's actually a lot you can do when you live in a city under uneasy anarchy and the cops have no mandate to arrest or kill you
[1:34:36] <Ravioli_Ronin> MAXI BOOST
[1:34:37] <Blank9> it gives -2 authority
[1:34:43] <$WaitHowDidIGetHere> Hey, Ben.

[1:42:13] <jorniev> @twohitgood AAAAAW MAN
[1:42:18] <kazadaz> There IS a deliberate dialogue loop you can do, but it's with a char you haven't met yet
[1:42:19] <%Blackleafx> also i've literally seen different voice actors for some characters IN the final cut. Though that might've been a bug, where it loads some mistaken line
[1:42:25] <%SilvaChariot0133> has to do with what shivers actually is statwise
[1:42:29] <%WhereIsWill> make it thru DMX cmon man!
[1:42:30] <aiutare47> @PkSilent01 of sorts....

[1:42:54] <%Blackleafx> @neroforte177 The sixth sense
[1:42:54] <%zeroarturia> @PkSilent01 He is in a Coma after having a Heart Attack
[1:43:00] <Tisaric> yeah Shivers kicks all kinds of ass
[1:43:01] <%SilvaChariot0133> @neroforte177 Shivers thought

[1:43:06] <+twohitgood> "DMX has not regained any brain function nearly a week after his overdose, and the family may soon be faced with a tormenting decision...whether to withdraw life support."

[1:43:29] <aiutare47> 7 hours jeez
[1:43:33] <%Blackleafx> But yea sorry for jumping the gun earlier, but I could've sworn I had a different version of that scene so it weirded me out
[1:43:33] <%neroforte177> @neroforte177 man thi s game is so cool i gotta getr it
[1:43:34] <nakpack> go pee pat
[1:43:34] <%heartlesshealer> BIRD SEARCH
[1:43:35] <+PkSilent01> @zeroarturia Oh shit really, didn't know
[1:43:44] <kazadaz> time for real life shivers
[1:43:45] <$Futurecity10> You should focus authority and reaction speed, they are severly lacking
[1:43:49] <%walternatorz> peepoops
[1:43:53] <%maskedsongbird> Is it possible to internalize literally every thought that pops in your head the whole game?
[1:43:57] <%baka_sugoi> PP
[1:43:58] <nomos42> Stretch and drink everyone
[1:43:59] <%BubbaRands> The call of Cthulhu ca ca
[1:44:02] <%Ranryu692> It only recently occurred to me that "pee" is literally just short for "piss"
[1:44:03] <$Futurecity10> no
[1:44:04] <kazadaz> Eh, authority's a dickhead
[1:44:05] <aiutare47> @Futurecity10 Auth specifically, rs is only useful a handful of times
[1:44:06] <%Blackleafx> @maskedsongbird no
[1:44:07] <penitentpendant> @neroforte177 Shivers is the old 'Noir Detective reads the world around him with supernatural fidelity' while Inland Empire is 'Talking to the world around him'
[1:44:08] <sirtommygunn> no theres more thoughts than slots
[1:44:11] <$Futurecity10> You only get 12 thoughts
[1:44:13] <wastelandsongbird> hey everyone!
[1:44:19] <meatman_noplan> You only have so many slots to internalize with.
[1:44:22] <%baka_sugoi> hello
[1:44:30] <+bapposbungers> Hello today! How is everyone doing?
[1:44:31] <meatman_noplan> And there are a lot of thoughts.
[1:44:33] <%Blackleafx> @penitentpendant Shivers is Noir Detective, Inland Empire is Twin Peaks Detective
[1:44:35] <aiutare47> @maskedsongbird there are like 40 thoughts or something
[1:44:48] <swordfi> internalising tinnitus is really good stat wise / practically
[1:44:51] <meatman_noplan> Shivers is if the state of sonder was a detective
[1:44:58] <kazadaz> You can forget Thoughts and then use their slots to get new Thoughts, so technically it might be possible if you used 100% of your skill points on it, but it would be hard
[1:44:59] <penitentpendant> @Blackleafx And by their power combined are you drowned in atmosphere
[1:45:01] <gryffinp> More to the point, shivers is the city and the street, inland empire is the room he's in.
[1:45:01] <%bassoontyphoon> Inland Empire reminds me of Ash Williams's breakdown in Evil Dead 2, whereas Shivers is more like narrating in Sin City
[1:45:13] <honterthompson> That little "taking in the city" moment is beautiful
[1:45:20] <JeysJumbleJams> i love when a dialogue happens and then 6 different stats give their own opinion on it, it's rad
[1:45:31] <dmtjinni> I summon PATO
[1:45:48] <penitentpendant> How to slow down a playthrough to a crawl: Get Encyclopedia, Inland Empire and Shivers to 6
[1:45:58] <honterthompson> It's interesting, because Encyclopedia is Harry remembering stuff he used to know, whereas Shivers isn't HIS knowledge- he's never been to Martinaise, he can't know all this crap
[1:46:01] <kazadaz> patrick du boisvin
[1:46:01] <honterthompson> It's like divine insipration
[1:46:07] <%maskedsongbird> @penitentpendant LUL
[1:46:23] <%toolofparanoia> Awww
[1:46:25] <+keyoray> I initially set Inland empire to 7. good times...
[1:46:27] <wastelandsongbird> I absolutely adore this game! but it is more of a watch than a personal play.
[1:46:27] <gryffinp> I hope you apologized to the dog

[2:05:32] <%AEUG_Ace_Kamille> I know there's like really strict rules about that.
[2:05:32] <penitentpendant> Ah, Dolores Dei, the goddess mentioned earlier
[2:05:32] <%SilvaChariot0133> don't worry about it
[2:05:33] <%Tuna_Can_0> The B in boat stands for boat
[2:05:34] <cardamomo88> DOLORES
[2:05:35] <%maskedsongbird> Dolores is a good boat name.
[2:05:35] <jorniev> 3

[2:07:08] <UberKingKai> No one there is hip except kim
[2:07:09] <JeysJumbleJams> kim is weaponizing our stupidity
[2:07:11] <SarahTsang> The voice acting is amazing in this game. I want this guy to talk to me all the time
[2:07:13] <$RealThiele> acab
[2:07:24] <%Tuna_Can_0> can we continue calling the boat 'Pleasure craft'
[2:07:29] <%Blackleafx> Failed the hidden check, huh
[2:07:40] <kazadaz> "Core competency", ugh
[2:07:46] <%maskedsongbird> @thelonechris Isn't Pat in his early/mid thirties? What exactly qualifies as "old" for Twitch, lol?
[2:07:46] <aiutare47> ask for the reality lowdown
[2:07:50] <jorniev> @Blackleafx wuh
[2:07:57] <+ReallyBigRocks> I harrased her for a hot minute about the license until Kim told me I was an idiot
[2:08:01] <ingman112> @blackleafx Shush
[2:08:06] <jorniev> @aiutare47 hell get there
[2:08:07] <+Grayhammatter> stupidity, a weapon to surpass metal gear?
[2:08:12] <kazadaz> 22 is old
[2:08:13] <%Blackleafx> @Blackleafx There's a check there, if you succeed it you can yell at her about the politics of boats
[2:08:16] <%Crookedspiral> Crookedspiral subscribed with Prime. They've subscribed for 24 months! Two years down and many more to go I hope. Thanks for all the streams and funny shit. Boop that doggo real good for me

[2:08:39] <Dr_Mooose> big money
[2:08:40] <nomos42> And no taxes I bet
[2:08:41] <penitentpendant> For an international company that's... not that impressive

[2:08:51] <aiutare47> @jorniev dont you get special dialogue if you do that first
[2:08:59] <+Grayhammatter> Wow.

[2:09:01] <kazadaz> @penitentpendant maybe real are bigger than dollars
[2:09:02] <%hrbeck_> that's like 200 Billion bottles!
[2:09:08] <$TheDrugWeCallWifi> @penitentpendant reminder that the RCM make 5500 real a year
[2:09:16] <%AncelDeLambert> how is your character so knowledgeable about geography but doesn't know what a billion is?
[2:09:17] <cornybones8066> setting population might be smaller
[2:09:20] <%maskedsongbird> @SarahTsang Lol, if that's the case then I should embrace my youth now, because I've only got four more years before I'm super old, too.
[2:09:21] <aiutare47> @penitentpendant Real are worth like 20 USD each
[2:09:27] <penitentpendant> @TheDrugWeCallWifi Cops are underpaid in every universe
[2:09:34] <%Ranryu692> Colonizers
[2:09:37] <huskarl_zap> fucking middle men
[2:09:41] <%Piemen99> @penitentpendant fucking wow
[2:09:49] <%Blackleafx> East India Company
[2:09:55] <%MelBrooksKA> Sounds like the Dutch East India
[2:09:59] <user_naim> @aiutare47 what is that based on?
[2:10:01] <gryffinp> The apricots must flow.
[2:10:02] <penitentpendant> @aiutare47 So the room costs 400 dollar a night? That's some inflation!
[2:10:07] <SarahTsang> I'm glad i don't sound like a posh British  person like this woman
[2:10:07] <%AncelDeLambert> thanks, Mercantilism
[2:10:14] <televisedrevolting> @anceldelambert Same way you can know the entire history of a fictional place, but forget your cousins name.
[2:10:32] <Chatterbox1991> @PatStaresAt  a MODERN East India Compay, think on that
[2:10:36] <nomos42> On rock and roll!!
[2:10:38] <aiutare47> @user_naim guess based on the fact that your gun is pawned for 15 Real if I remember correctly
[2:10:38] <chippybippers> oh great I get the reference now! (closes my history book)
[2:10:40] <+Mrbaconator> YA COMMIE UPRISING
[2:10:45] <muXPerience> Ghislaine, huh
[2:10:55] <kazadaz> It gies you 4 XP, right?
[2:10:56] <FlamingoJazz> Communism? Not working? Never no.
[2:10:56] <gryffinp> You probably got a communism point for that dialogue
[2:11:00] <+swesterly> it's only specific commie dialogue that gets you the exp
[2:11:00] <%maskedsongbird> Oh, so she's a WASP colonizer too...
[2:11:02] <%Blackleafx> there it is
[2:11:02] <%asgard147> SHE'S A CAPITALIST! limesD
[2:11:03] <Zap_Rowsdower32> East India Company, the first megacorp
[2:11:04] <JeysJumbleJams> you need to be *more* communist
[2:11:06] <%Blackleafx> Just takes a bit to trigger
[2:11:07] <%Piemen99> you dont say
[2:11:08] <+ReallyBigRocks> I mean you are talking to like the Anti-Commie here
[2:11:09] <+Jeshk0> Communism has no chance against a .... LIBERAL!
[2:11:11] <%Mucmaster> Theres your xp
[2:11:12] <penitentpendant> @Piemen99 They're not bilking their subsidiaries like most companies, having such a low total means they're more likely reinvesting in local branches. It's a hint the company is likely more 'ethical' than most
[2:11:14] <%JusTTheGuyYouNeed> it doesn't show the xp you get
[2:11:36] <%toolofparanoia> toolofparanoia subscribed at Tier 1. They've subscribed for 16 months, currently on a 16 month streak! 16 months of working from home and watching streams. Also damn this game is cool, i'm probably gonna get it, and play long hours into the night if I get the time. Thank you for opening my eyes to this entertaining experience!
[2:11:38] <%torusendor> @penitentpendant They hired trained killers to break up a strike
[2:11:41] <kazadaz> @penitentpendant they hired mercs to break a strike dude
[2:11:43] <user_naim> @aiutare47 is thought that was a joke about him being a piece of shit? the spinners were 200
[2:11:45] <%Piemen99> wild
[2:11:47] <$TheDrugWeCallWifi> @penitentpendant I appreciate the headcanon but I highly doubt that's what they were going for
[2:11:47] <%AncelDeLambert> HAVE AT THEE,  KRAKEN
[2:11:50] <ingman112> It should, though, shouldn’t it? I mean art cop does
[2:12:05] <%Ranryu692> shooting himself in the foot seems like Harry's thing, though
[2:12:06] <cornybones8066> The real villian is The Coalition
[2:12:10] <+ALazo> Yes ma'am, it is you who are derailing us
[2:12:17] <aiutare47> @user_naim He also says the spinners mustve been pinched of royalty or a high ranking gang member
[2:12:23] <%maskedsongbird> An artistic communist cop--truly a walking contradiction.
[2:12:32] <user_naim> @aiutare47 hmm
[2:12:36] <penitentpendant> @torusendor @kazadaz True. But at least the first negotiation was successful for a while with far more reasonable means
[2:12:39] <Zap_Rowsdower32> HAM SANDWICH RACE

[2:13:29] <aiutare47> @user_naim I mean, Im guessing on all this, but your gun is considered pretty common and cheap, so like a Glock, cheap ones of those go for like 2-300 usd
[2:13:31] <%maskedsongbird> @tanarath Of course, can never forget the Hobo. Or the Sorry...
[2:13:48] <penitentpendant> @torusendor Tis ultimately the problem, more hands mean more varied decisions. Patience is limited and the more extreme elements come to the fore in duress
[2:13:52] <$TheDrugWeCallWifi> LUL
[2:13:53] <%toolofparanoia> No Fuck you Measurehead!
[2:13:53] <gryffinp> the lesson of course is that if you give the union heathcare and better pay they will strike again.

[2:14:24] <cornybones8066> they want the company to be owned by the workers
[2:14:25] <%maskedsongbird> @Zap_Rowsdower32 What is with Measurehead's obsession with ham sandwiches? Dude sounds really hungry.

[2:17:24] <Zap_Rowsdower32> This is no a scab zone
[2:17:26] <Parapattern> Wild Pines would just bring in the Pinkertons
[2:17:27] <@commanderclaw> Strike Breaker is the technical term
[2:17:27] <+Jeshk0> these paid scabs especially
[2:17:29] <iosephe> People who work when there's a strike
[2:17:31] <%SilvaChariot0133> they kinda fuck over everyone
[2:17:34] <aiutare47> @Saltmeisterr scabs are people who step in during strikes to get cash

[2:17:45] <jorniev> OH?
[2:17:48] <%bread_assassin> I just found out what a scab was earlier today coincidentally in another Disco Elysium stream.
[2:17:52] <COMB711> There's a trucker strike in new england and all the scab drivers keep crashing into the underside of bridges, it's great
[2:17:52] <cornybones8066> you should shoot them if you get the chance.
[2:17:53] <jorniev> OOOOOOOOOOOH
[2:17:55] <mortificent> fuck the scabs
[2:17:56] <%maskedsongbird> When you say bullshit wages, are they too high or too low?

[2:17:58] <%torusendor> Desperate people, generally
[2:17:59] <+l0rd_anoos> diry bastards
[2:17:59] <jorniev> yeah thats bad
[2:18:02] <+twohitgood> scabs are fucking scum
[2:18:03] <%asgard147> ah, I see, thank you Pat limesHmm
[2:18:04] <%SilvaChariot0133> and runs wages into the ground
[2:18:06] <+Grayhammatter> so, fuck the scabs
[2:18:08] <adzy2k6> A SCAB can also be a regular employee who ignores the strike
[2:18:08] <%Blackleafx> @PatStaresAt Historically most companies have also used underpaid immigrants for that purpose, or migrant workers, as well.
[2:18:08] <kazadaz> ASCABAB
[2:18:12] <MonsieurHedge> very very low wages
[2:18:13] <magboost> Low more often than not
[2:18:13] <Archmortal> @maskedsongbird incredibly low
[2:18:13] <Ravioli_Ronin> Amazon Twitter scab bots

[2:18:20] <+Jiggisnipe> sounds like people who need jobs lol
[2:18:21] <%toolofparanoia> Subhuman trash!
[2:18:25] <aiutare47> now in defense of them, in modern times, at least in Ag shit, scabs are usually immigrants who really need the cash and are afraid to work with unions
[2:18:26] <muXPerience> The wages are low, it's not even like they're selling it for good
[2:18:28] <%crazyspartan214> like that kid from Spongebob Squarepants
[2:18:31] <cornybones8066> " RIGHT TO WORK"
[2:18:31] <%Monkeyweed21> Scabs are generally desperate for ANY work, its the boss's fault for hiring them
[2:18:32] <%DoctorBird> DoctorBird subscribed at Tier 1. They've subscribed for 5 months, currently on a 4 month streak! 
[2:18:32] <%Deft_Thought> Most folks called in as "scabs" aren't entirely aware of a strike taking place
[2:18:33] <COMB711> Literal bottom feeders
[2:18:33] <@commanderclaw> The sad part is the scabs are getting exploited too
[2:18:33] <OmegaDragonR2> @PatStaresAt scabs seem like an exercise in futility
[2:18:36] <sirtommygunn> scabs are bad but they are merely people being taken advantage of by the bosses
[2:18:36] <+twohitgood> scabs keep the water moving down the drain.
[2:18:41] <%torusendor> That's why you have the mob break their legs
[2:18:42] <vilecrois> Do I sense a grocery store story comin'

[2:18:52] <+RightRevJake> unionize the scabs
[2:18:53] <%Deft_Thought> Nowadays its folks getting exploited
[2:19:00] <%maskedsongbird> If the wages are so low, then what is the motivation to even be a scab? I don't really get how that works.
[2:19:02] <%toolofparanoia> Scabs have no shame.
[2:19:02] <NeroInfinite> Yep scabs work for basically shit wages.
[2:19:04] <mortificent> @l0rd_anoos the Boss wins

[2:19:16] <penitentpendant> @maskedsongbird You're that desperate
[2:19:16] <%Blackleafx> @maskedsongbird Usually its people who have no other oppertunities
[2:19:17] <+AWanderingKenku> While Scabs suck, the real villain is the one hiring them.  Scabs are desperate for work a lot of the time.
[2:19:17] <+Lokibringer> it's almost like capitalism is designed to exploit people. weird.

[2:19:23] <fakespecialist> hey, i am a scab :(
[2:19:23] <aiutare47> @maskedsongbird you need work bad enough and you dont want to/cant work with the union
[2:19:24] <+Jiggisnipe> @maskedsongbird I imagine they are desperate
[2:19:24] <cornybones8066> scabs don't believe in the point of the strike.
[2:19:25] <PartyFavors> @maskedsongbird Desperation (and maybe bribery)
[2:19:25] <@commanderclaw> @maskedsongbird People with even worse circumstances than the standard workers

[2:23:00] <BlackMage66652> @PatStaresAt Fuck police unions though

[2:24:29] <+twohitgood> never trust someone who *wants* power
[2:24:30] <@commanderclaw> So we should appoint decent human beings to all positions
[2:24:32] <Chatterbox1991> @PatStaresAt  i have to imagine something about the Quebec are uniquly fucked compared to the rest of Canada?

[2:24:34] <cornybones8066> the wicked seek power
[2:24:36] <%Dylveryn> comrade pat
[2:24:39] <Chatterbox1991> unions*
[2:24:39] <dinnydanny777> Unions appoint small groups or singular people to lead them which causes an obvious problem, no one is uncorruptible
[2:24:40] <+l0rd_anoos> Papa Pat a true hero
[2:24:44] <Press_X_ToJASON> who wants power? the people who want it, for reasons. simple enough.
[2:24:44] <UberKingKai> Absolute power corrupts
[2:24:44] <Archmortal> @AncelDeLambert That is in fact not how capitalism works
[2:24:45] <%ssjklyco> People who should be in positions of power, are smart enough to not be in positions of power
[2:24:45] <%maskedsongbird> @maskofmichael How would that even work?
[2:24:45] <$Ziegsy> @FlamingoJazz I get $2000 a month, tax free, to sit on my ass and play video games. I could not PHATHOM working in todays society
[2:24:51] <nomos42> Don't need a union if you own the meanns, just saying
[2:24:53] <%torusendor> @AncelDeLambert Explain the stock market

[2:25:12] <+RightRevJake> @Monkeyweed21 Workers won't hurt anyone if the scabs stay on the right side of the picket line. IRL they usually don't hurt anyone anyway, because they don't want to get arrested for committing a crime
[2:25:12] <cornybones8066> can you meet Edgar in game?
[2:25:14] <%Piemen99> @commanderclaw They'll hate it but hey, fuck em better for the rest of us

[2:25:41] <+twohitgood> oh like russia
[2:25:41] <aiutare47> so fuckin real holy shit
[2:25:43] <Chatterbox1991> @PatStaresAt  Does Quebec Union corruption tie into the "Eternal Constrction Projects" in Montreal?
[2:25:44] <+mczarklesby> "I'm seeing double! Four Claires!"
[2:25:47] <sirtommygunn> No consecutive terms
[2:25:48] <Archmortal> @AncelDeLambert Capitalism is "I have this product, and I will continue to raise its price while your wages stagnate and you get replaced with people competing for less and less pay."
[2:25:51] <%AncelDeLambert> here's a hint for everyone reading: THE STOCK MARKET IS NOT FUCKING EVERYTHING IN EXISTENCE
[2:25:51] <+vicar_anat> Just the two of us, we can make it if we tryyyyyyy
[2:25:52] <gryffinp> That's clearly not how a "term limit" is supposed to work but hey

[2:26:04] <%torusendor> @AncelDeLambert You're so close
[2:26:05] <%Mucmaster> Fun fact sometimes you'll be talking to Edgar in game but it won't explicitly tell you
[2:26:20] <boywunderkind> Make this bourgeois woman eat her own words

[2:26:30] <Chatterbox1991> Jimmy Hoffa
[2:26:36] <%AncelDeLambert> @Archmortal lol fucking just no. If you have problems with corporatism and Shareholder Primacy and corruption then so do I but that doesn't suddenly make Capitalism immediately immoral
[2:26:40] <dinnydanny777> The trick is being the leader and then kicking out people who aren't corrupt so that you can implicitly blackmail the next boss for money when you're gone 4Head
[2:26:44] <%torusendor> @AncelDeLambert Tell that to the banana republics
[2:26:44] <%AEUG_Ace_Kamille> @Mucmaster Shit, I didn't notice.
[2:26:51] <ingman112> @mucmaster save your bits for non-spoilers goddammit
[2:26:55] <chippybippers> they're STILL better than nothing
[2:27:02] <cornybones8066> "local" workingmen is the key.
[2:27:07] <%AncelDeLambert> @torusendor that does'nt even make sense

[2:27:36] <jorniev> I hate that so much IM SO MAD I LIVE IN COMMUNIST CORRUPT HELL
[2:27:36] <+RightRevJake> @AncelDeLambert All of those things are inseperable from capitalism.
[2:27:37] <%GuildmasterAhnonay> @anceldelambert Capitalism is an inherently immoral system. By its very nature, power is designed to concentrate in the hands of a few - it's feudalism with extra steps.

[2:27:47] <justianxix> that pretty big corruption
[2:27:50] <sirtommygunn> Look nobody would deal with being a union leader if there weren't some corruption benefits
[2:27:53] <%Blackleafx> @Mucmaster d'ya have any screenshot of it? I've only ever seen his portrait with the lazy eye
[2:27:56] <+Grayhammatter> disappeared? monkaS
[2:28:03] <Archmortal> @AncelDeLambert No one is saying it's immoral.  It's a system.  But the problem is that the system naturally trends toward fucking people over and stagnating wages while inflation runs rampant, and immoral people make that happen faster
[2:28:04] <%AncelDeLambert> @GuildmasterAhnonay no? Completely no

[2:28:53] <penitentpendant> "Disappearing" is a show of power

[2:29:22] <%maskedsongbird> @AncelDeLambert If capitalism is defined by competition, which is what capitalists claim, then corporatism is what happens when somebody *wins* that competition.

[2:31:49] <magboost> What was the Name for being a Centrist again?
[2:31:51] <jorniev> corrupt capitalism is the worst because eveyone rich likes it and corrupt communists like it too.

[2:32:13] <Devbob98> I’m poor and I don’t like it very much
[2:32:18] <dinnydanny777> What country has capitalism that isn't corrupt LUL
[2:32:19] <%GuildmasterAhnonay> It always just feels so gross to hear people who are getting actively exploited bend over and say "No this is good actually, what if I was one of the ones doing the exploiting, then I wouldn't want the exploiting to stop!"
[2:32:25] <%bassoontyphoon> @boywunderkind Spoilers, but powers due to exposure to the pale
[2:32:30] <jorniev> im a disgusting moralist
[2:32:34] <aiutare47> @Monkeyweed21 Unions can demand better reps, they wont always get them, but they can
[2:32:47] <Devbob98> I’m a stone cutter
[2:32:47] <cornybones8066> Oh man the pale makes the Church so cool.
[2:33:01] <+Jeshk0> my first playthru was mostly a moralist playthru...
[2:33:16] <nomos42> I have to remember that a lot of people in chat are basically children
[2:33:24] <%AEUG_Ace_Kamille> Who else Moralist gang in here?
[2:33:25] <FlamingoJazz> RELOAD
[2:33:28] <aiutare47> @jorniev yeah for all this games wacky crazy options, it somehow makes you want to take things kinda, normal? I dont know how to explain
[2:33:50] <cornybones8066> "why can't you be NORMAL!"
[2:33:56] <gryffinp> Its easy to be a moralist semi-accidentally in DE, since SOMETIMES the "let's not be a crazy asshole right now" dialogue options will give you moralist points
[2:34:08] <ingman112> I think it’s due to how well-rounded and sympathetic all the characters are. They feel like real people that you just want to see things turn out okay for
[2:34:21] <gryffinp> SOMETIMES it breaks it out into "absurd parody of centrism" and "I'm just going to ignore that and move on"
[2:34:24] <penitentpendant> @AEUG_Ace_Kamille The most mundane combo possible: Moralist Boring Cop
[2:34:34] <+Jeshk0> i mostly wanted to do "solve the crime and explore the world" stuff, and although i enjoyed the political philosophizing, it wasnt what i was most focused on while playing
[2:34:40] <+tussletoes> anyone see that post where some guy's subs in a relationship got together and unionized against him
[2:34:41] <cornybones8066> Elysium is really good about selling the message that people have good and bad things about them. *Everyone*
[2:34:42] <%DiscoMatador> Yo has pat got the "reality lowdown" from this lady yet?
[2:34:44] <nomos42> I'm trying a fascist run now and it's hard because I don't wanna piss of Kim
[2:34:55] <cornybones8066> Lol sub union yeah.
[2:34:57] <%toolofparanoia> Is Nihilism a route in Disco Elysium?
[2:35:00] <chainsaw105> Harry is a gag comic character in a world of straight-man characters
[2:35:00] <gryffinp> You're gonna have to piss off kim
[2:35:02] <%AEUG_Ace_Kamille> @penitentpendant Sorry Moralist Ultra-Lib here.
[2:35:03] <+RightRevJake> The Moralist Thought Cabinet text really sinks in how the "moderate" Centrism it upholds is kind of terrifying
[2:35:04] <%bassoontyphoon> @nomos42 be a fascist at night??
[2:35:04] <aiutare47> @DiscoMatador no
[2:35:06] <magboost> Wait What @tussletoes
[2:35:07] <kazadaz> No, he hasn't talked about realityh yet
[2:35:11] <%GuildmasterAhnonay> I should honestly play this again, I was mostly centrist the first time and I've radicalized a lot since then.
[2:35:11] <cornybones8066> No nhilism i think
[2:35:11] <@commanderclaw> @nomos42 Don't take Racial Theory if you don't want to piss off Kim
[2:35:11] <penitentpendant> @toolofparanoia "Doom Cop" in a way
[2:35:17] <jorniev> @jorniev its suposed to be a composed centrist ideal, but then you lean how that main form of government is still corrupt and responsible for the entire world,  and doing a terrible job i hate them so much.
[2:35:26] <+TheGenerousDon> Thank you once again for being apart of my childhood and now adulthood
[2:35:31] <%DiscoMatador> @aiutare47 sick thanks
[2:35:31] <ingman112> @toolofparanoia not explicitly politically. You can be an apocalypse cop and express nihilistic thoughts though
[2:35:34] <%bread_assassin> Moralist goes real well with boring, but what would the other pairings be. Ultraliberal works with superstar. But what about  apoc and sorry
[2:35:39] <dinnydanny777> I don't think centrists are real
[2:35:43] <kazadaz> in the church dance scene i failed a composure check and called kim a racial slur

[3:04:55] <Sol_Install> ok which is worst, godly or impossible?
[3:04:57] <+PkSilent01> @PkSilent01 Don't have a computer to run it and I don't have a PS4/5
[3:05:01] <%Blackleafx> @yeeyeyee That kinda misses the whole point of what drove people to fascism. And is also a bit ableist.

[3:05:17] <+Daedalus119> nah it's the second time he's been alone with the kids
[3:05:17] <ingman112> I believe impossible is harder than godly
[3:05:20] <%solracc25> psaJpeg
[3:05:20] <%Blackleafx> @toolofparanoia inshallah
[3:05:21] <sirtommygunn> its true
[3:05:21] <penitentpendant> @Sol_Install There's a number next to the check, the higher the harder it is
[3:05:21] <ingman112> Impossible is like 20
[3:05:26] <%MelBrooksKA> Guys can we not
[3:05:27] <@commanderclaw> @j___a___c___k___ The only benefit of being a fasicst is that you get double the bonus from alcohol, and the description for fascism talks about getting a drink constantly
[3:05:27] <Sol_Install> PEE PEE TIME
[3:05:27] <yeeyeyee> @j___a___c___k___ the same could be said of all religions

[3:05:38] <sirtommygunn> time for pee pee poo poo
[3:05:39] <Sol_Install> @penitentpendant and what was godly?
[3:05:41] <WakeUpThrow> Impossible is 18, right?
[3:05:42] <kazadaz> There's a special Thought to make that Impossible check easier
[3:05:42] <cornybones8066> how high can skills go?
[3:05:44] <susukouhai> Poopoo wants to peepee
[3:05:46] <@commanderclaw> @swesterly I'll tell him, don't worry

[3:06:14] <cornybones8066> this setting reminds me a lot of The Combine from Half-Life.
[3:06:15] <ingman112> @swesterly he will, and he’s going to ask about everything. We can just encourage him to get jamais when it appears —which the thought itself actually tells you to get
[3:06:16] <yeeyeyee> @Blackleafx I'm intensely interested to know how you worked ableism into this, please explain further
[3:06:17] <Crippl3> @magboost :)
[3:06:22] <+Badendchan> This dog is just pissin' and vomming all over this stream
[3:06:22] <@commanderclaw> Yeah, once you hit day 3 it's hard to miss the hardcore LORE
[3:06:23] <%SilvaChariot0133> @magboost don't worry about it
[3:06:23] <jorniev> POLITICS HARD BRAIN HURTY
[3:06:29] <ingman112> It even says “this is the important one”
[3:06:38] <%Ascethetic> @popcultureaficionado dude chill
[3:06:43] <dmtjinni> did he get the 130 real from her yet?
[3:06:49] <j___a___c___k___> @commanderclaw the benefits of being a facist is that your jokes are never funny on tv and you cannot become a comedian
[3:06:50] <%Blackleafx> @yeeyeyee the guy calling nazis "crazy mentally ill people" to explain why people became nazis
[3:06:53] <cornybones8066> no
[3:06:53] <%toolofparanoia> politics make gief frew up
[3:06:53] <%MelBrooksKA> no

[3:07:11] <%toolofparanoia> LETS GO
[3:07:12] <%asgard147> Welp, I'm tired so I'm going to bed. Night Pat! Night Chat! limesHi
[3:07:19] <%Blackleafx> LETS GO
[3:07:31] <dinnydanny777> @asgard147 Night VoHiYo
[3:07:32] <magboost> @asgard147 night Asgard
[3:07:34] <yeeyeyee> @Blackleafx Oh I got very confused by twitch's garbage UI and thought you were responding to me and not him
[3:07:39] <@commanderclaw> @j___a___c___k___ I'll just be Apocalypse Cop instead and stay at home for fear of the world
[3:07:41] <+Jeshk0> pats actually questioning gief and his loyalty to THE CAUSE
[3:07:41] <user_naim> Jank Jonk is hardcore
[3:07:42] <dmtjinni> does he know u can get 130 real off her?
[3:07:44] <sirtommygunn> also yeah nazis are not all mentally ill, they're just horrible people
[3:07:53] <%Blackleafx> @yeeyeyee No worries
[3:07:55] <vilecrois> @asgard147 don't let the ultra liberals getcha
[3:07:58] <penitentpendant> @Sol_Install From the list: Godly = 16-17, Impossible: 18-20
[3:08:04] <%maskedsongbird> Wow, time flew by real quick. Stared 4pm my time, and now it's already 7.
[3:08:08] <%toolofparanoia> R E L O A D
[3:08:11] <j___a___c___k___> @yeeyeyee they become nazi because they are mentally ill
[3:08:13] <+IrishWeegee> RELOAD!
[3:08:14] <+keyoray> Reload <3
[3:08:15] <dinnydanny777> so ultra liberals are neo libs I guess
[3:08:20] <cornybones8066> you don't need to be mental to be a nazi. that undermines the villainy of the act.
[3:08:22] <sirtommygunn> though being mentally ill makes it easier to recruit to extremist ideology
[3:08:26] <%Blackleafx> Keep in mind the numbers next to it arent how high the skill has to be, its what the roll has to be
[3:08:30] <ingman112> @dinnydanny777 yep interchangeable here
[3:08:30] <penitentpendant> @Sol_Install Though the big thing is the gap between your skill levels and the actual target number
[3:08:35] <aiutare47> @dinnydanny777 no neolibs would be Moralists
[3:08:39] <%Monkeyweed21> yea people fall to Fascism because its a really easy answer to alot of really hard questions, even if that answer is totally divorced from reality.
[3:08:40] <yeeyeyee> Never forget: You are not immune to propaganda
[3:08:51] <%Blackleafx> @yeeyeyee Fascism arises from the failures of liberalism, not from people's mental illnesses
[3:08:51] <aiutare47> @yeeyeyee Yeet
[3:08:52] <Sol_Install> @penitentpendant it weird that godly is below impossible then
[3:09:03] <ingman112> @aiutare47 wouldn’t that be more centrists? Which I wouldn’t call neoliberals
[3:09:17] <%MelBrooksKA> Can someone please start swinging a ban hammer
[3:09:17] <penitentpendant> @Sol_Install He may have a higher stat for that one
[3:09:17] <@commanderclaw> @Monkeyweed21 Yeah, it's super appealing to just say "It's all this group's fault!" rather than look at why humans do bad things
[3:09:17] <%Blackleafx> @Monkeyweed21 would highly reccomend umberto eco's work on that btw, you hit the nail on the head
[3:09:21] <ingman112> Unless I’m fucking up my definitions
[3:09:27] <Sol_Install> @penitentpendant AH ok
[3:09:27] <cornybones8066> racism and facism are simple solutions people take to complex problems.
[3:09:28] <aiutare47> @ingman112 what are neolibs if not the status quo?
[3:09:31] <%Ascethetic> i want to know COMMUNISM thinks of this
[3:09:33] <$TheDrugWeCallWifi> @j___a___c___k___ My dude, Nazis were normal people like you and me that got conned into carrying out a banal evil. That's like the number one lesson, it can happen anywhere
[3:09:34] <j___a___c___k___> @cornybones8066 nope, still guilty. but they did vile stuff because they are mentally il.. no sane person would do nazi shit
[3:09:36] <magboost> Also The world is complicated and knowing how small your impact is can feel very shocking
[3:09:38] <@commanderclaw> Hey guys, we should stop probably
[3:09:41] <DazzlingFuhrer> I just got here and boy did this chat fall to shit, wew lad.
[3:09:42] <cornybones8066> it's a point in Disco E
[3:09:47] <penitentpendant> @Sol_Install I THINK Godly is around 20% and Impossible is 8%
[3:09:57] <+keyoray> @penitentpendant so God is possible then?
[3:09:59] <sirtommygunn> like, all political ideologies at their core are about how to split up limited resources in the population, and the nazi's answer to that question is "give it all to me, fuck everyone else"
[3:09:59] <@commanderclaw> I know this game is political AF, but I think it's time to stop
[3:10:12] <gryffinp> It ain't gonna stop.
[3:10:14] <%Blackleafx> @cornybones8066 You're completely dismissing the actual reasons though. If you don't analyze the root of the problem, all you're curing is the symptoms, not the disease.
[3:10:18] <%Blackleafx> and fair, sorry claw
[3:10:18] <Sol_Install> yea i remember that godly option being 17% to 20% and that impossible was very low
[3:10:22] <balthazar758> dog ):
[3:10:29] <penitentpendant> @keyoray No check is truly impossible, box cars always win. But 3% is a LOT of save scumming
[3:10:32] <%toolofparanoia> i love this game except for how it makes peoples brains turn to gelatinous sludge
[3:10:35] <%Ascethetic> sub mode might be needed
[3:10:36] <+ThomasOfTroy> @commanderclaw please stop this and put us in emote
[3:10:42] <ingman112> @aiutare47 Neoliberals support the status quo but not inherently, like moralists do. They support free-market capitalism above all else—and that happens to be the current one
[3:10:43] <cornybones8066> double 6's are a auto success
[3:10:47] <gryffinp> @penitentpendant technically untrue
[3:10:47] <yeeyeyee> Any roll that requires 20 is one you're expected to fail
[3:10:49] <j___a___c___k___> @yeeyeyee every facist here on brazil are mentally ill man ..they all have anger problems and they are all frustrated
[3:10:51] <@commanderclaw> @ThomasOfTroy I really try to only do that as a last resort
[3:10:53] <%SilvaChariot0133> there IS an item that makes cheesing shit easier
[3:11:01] <honterthompson> There's genuinely a lot of good discourse happening here though
[3:11:02] <+ThomasOfTroy> @commanderclaw fair enough
[3:11:02] <honterthompson> Amid the trash
[3:11:03] <%s_xylocalsingles> @commanderclaw just start timing out people
[3:11:05] <penitentpendant> @gryffinp True, but those are story gated
[3:11:08] <cornybones8066> red checks are the killers.
[3:11:14] <kazadaz> Ideology = worldview
[3:11:15] <justianxix> The discussion in chat isn't even that bad
[3:11:16] <%s_xylocalsingles> if they wont shut up shoot em
[3:11:19] <dinnydanny777> gigaboOtsLongBani1 gigaboOtsLongBani2 gigaboOtsLongBani2 gigaboOtsLongBani3
[3:11:23] <%valriot> The fuck did I walk into
[3:11:28] <cornybones8066> some checks are auto fails on purpose.
[3:11:29] <@commanderclaw> @justianxix I agree, I just worry it could get worse quick
[3:11:32] <%Ranryu692> psaRaffle psaRaffle psaRaffle psaRaffle psaRaffle psaRaffle psaRaffle psaRaffle psaRaffle psaRaffle
[3:11:37] <@SoFarFetched> geefBruh geefBruh
[3:11:41] <%s_xylocalsingles> !raffle
[3:11:43] <cornybones8066> political arguing about Disco E
[3:11:44] <penitentpendant> @gryffinp Integration of story and gameplay at its finest
[3:11:45] <j___a___c___k___> @TheDrugWeCallWifi nope, they are dumb ,and ill.
[3:11:45] <ingman112> @aiutare47 like Joyce is a neo, not a moralist. She supported the revolution ideologically but was willing to collaborate with the moralists after they won; that doesn’t make her one of them
[3:11:45] <+keyoray> Thanksgiving dinner with the family
[3:11:46] <%Blackleafx> Also guys, yes, neoliberalism is the status quo IRL, but its not in Disco Elysium's world. Its more comparable to what neoliberalism was like during the Reagan and Thatcher years.
[3:11:50] <%LeiaSkynoober> @j___a___c___k___ Please, stop. And go google "The Banality of Evil"
[3:11:50] <balthazar758> OhMyDog
[3:11:51] <chaingrabss> atpRtsuspectd
[3:11:53] <magboost> @j___a___c___k___  blaming the problem as people just being mentally ill ignores the fact that its easy to do things that don't directly affect you
[3:11:56] <%s_xylocalsingles> were like 3 minutes away from sub mode cause people wont stop politics
[3:11:57] <kazadaz> Is it possible to deal witht he body without having Volumetric Shit Compressor?
[3:12:03] <%toolofparanoia> Chat needs to cease please
[3:12:04] <%s_xylocalsingles> and then someone crying in whispers/DMs about being timed out
[3:12:04] <%Ascethetic> on no, who summoned @sofarfetched
[3:12:05] <yeeyeyee> I think splitting the game into red and white checks is a very cool idea that more games in the genre fucking steal
[3:12:06] <@SoFarFetched> Alright,guys  PLEASE take it to DMs
[3:12:07] <%Blackleafx> @kazadaz yes
[3:12:08] <%valriot> People not understanding politics is a theme for today huh
[3:12:15] <nomos42> @kazadaz yeh, totally
[3:12:15] <$TheDrugWeCallWifi> @kazadaz Yes
[3:12:17] <%weissguard> What in the actual hell is happening?
[3:12:17] <yeeyeyee> *need to steal
[3:12:21] <@SoFarFetched> If these discussions is not about the games
[3:12:24] <honterthompson> @cornybones8066 I know there's one important lategame check where you're supposed to fail, but if you pass, you still lose the interaction....and Harry asks his own brain why, only for it to say "you can do everything right and still fail"
[3:12:26] <@SoFarFetched> and is ACTUALLY about politics in the real word
[3:12:26] <gryffinp> @kazadaz Yes, through aa combination of levelling the skill and rolling well.
[3:12:26] <%s_xylocalsingles> shoot them shoot them shoot them shoot them
[3:12:28] <@SoFarFetched> take those to DM's
[3:12:28] <+ThomasOfTroy> @valriot just like real life
[3:12:30] <%Blackleafx> @weissguard Disco. Disco is happening.
[3:12:32] <%SilvaChariot0133> Armchair politics is happening
[3:12:36] <mortificent> yeah, it's expected with an overtly political game
[3:12:41] <jorniev> POLITICS about this game about politics!? the nerveeee
[3:12:42] <%Monkeyweed21> yea the theme of the ultraliberals is that they just went with the winning side
[3:12:46] <%maenos2> so hey y'allhear about Macross today?
[3:12:46] <@SoFarFetched> I understand this game has A LOT of politics.
[3:12:51] <honterthompson> This game IS about real-world politics, though- you're supposed to be having these conversations lol
[3:12:52] <@SoFarFetched> But once we start talking about real life politics
[3:12:54] <@SoFarFetched> then we got some pr oblems.
[3:12:56] <cornybones8066> @honterthompson oh damn! I didn't know that
[3:12:58] <kazadaz> Chat does not exist to entertain you
[3:13:02] <+RightRevJake> this chat may be getting spicy with the politics but at least there's no fascists
[3:13:06] <magboost> Wait so how many hours into the game are we?
[3:13:12] <dinnydanny777> Bunger
[3:13:13] <ingman112> I feel like political discourse is fine as long as it’s relevant what’s on-screen at the moment, and as long we’re not calling people slurs
[3:13:15] <+Daedalus119> @maenos2 nope. what about it?
[3:13:16] <jorniev> its all real politics,
[3:13:18] <cornybones8066> Disco E is trying to make you think about politics
[3:13:20] <kazadaz> like 6 hours in
[3:13:27] <%Blackleafx> @magboost like 8-10?
[3:13:31] <%Ranryu692> @magboost this is the third stream
[3:13:32] <%kainhighwind1990> kainhighwind1990 subscribed at Tier 1. They've subscribed for 3 months, currently on a 3 month streak! Hey Pat, been following since the early TBF days, been loving the streams when I can catch them. Just wondering but what are your favorite and least favorite dungeons in FF14? Thanks for all the LPs and streams you've done over the years!
[3:13:34] <@SoFarFetched> Yes as I said,politics is fine. But once we start going into REAL life politics about specific events. It can get really nasty.
[3:13:34] <balthazar758> bunger bunger
[3:13:36] <+keyoray> @magboost 3 or 12, it's hard to say
[3:13:37] <%CordwoodMather> CordwoodMather subscribed with Prime. They've subscribed for 26 months, currently on a 5 month streak! psaDogchamp psaDogchamp
[3:13:37] <%Blackleafx> Oh, yeah maybe more like 6
[3:13:39] <user_naim> Stepped out for a moment, are we calling for the death of X group yet?
[3:13:40] <cornybones8066> and I can say it certainly has made me think about what it is I value
[3:13:42] <@SoFarFetched> BEcuase well,Disco Elysium has a shit ton of it.
[3:13:44] <%maenos2> @daedalus119 harmony gold stopped being shits.  licensing agreements in place to bring it ALL over
[3:13:48] <jorniev> man this game IS INCREDIBLE
[3:13:50] <@SoFarFetched> and its hard to NOT talk about the stuff in Disco.
[3:13:51] <honterthompson> All politics is real politics, this game is allegory
[3:13:52] <penitentpendant> Unless I missed a lot, we're still on day 2
[3:13:55] <yeeyeyee> See the reason this chat has gone to shit is because there's no such thing as objective morality
[3:14:02] <+Daedalus119> @maenos2 nice
[3:14:08] <%toolofparanoia> Despite chat getting too real I love this game and everything this game exudes
[3:14:10] <ingman112> I’m expecting woolie’s playthrough to get nice and spicy tbh
[3:14:12] <%Bluwizard21> @penitentpendant we are still on day 2
[3:14:25] <dmtjinni> Is "Divinity: Original Sin 2 " any good?
[3:14:27] <dinnydanny777> psaDab
[3:14:27] <cornybones8066> Woolie's gonna have fun with this
[3:14:28] <%Blackleafx> Woolie's playthrough is going to be a glorious trainwreck
[3:14:34] <%Blackleafx> his chat seems to be a lot more politically volatile
[3:14:36] <penitentpendant> @Bluwizard21 Notes
[3:14:36] <honterthompson> @ingman112 Looking forward to Woolie's playthrough where he tries really hard to make Measurehead like him
[3:14:39] <+IrishWeegee> so who else thought the Intel profanity filter was an April fools joke then screamed when they saw the video was uploaded mid March?
[3:14:40] <poogis_kun> i will say that i'm impressed with how well read a lot of the chat seems to be
[3:14:40] <%Ranryu692> I want chat to be put in emote mode so that when Pat comes back he's like "what the fuck guys"
[3:14:41] <%Blackleafx> like, Pat's chat, for all our arguing, is pretty chill
[3:14:43] <penitentpendant> @Bluwizard21 *Noted!
[3:14:45] <+Daedalus119> @dmtjinni yes
[3:14:45] <magboost> @yeeyeyee Peoplel who think their objective are the least trustworthy people on the Planet
[3:14:46] <UnfilteredComic> @dmtjinni Extremely
[3:14:50] <justianxix> The game is going to talk about these things all game, you better have your seatbelts on because chat's gonna talk about it
[3:14:55] <+RightRevJake> @ingman112 oh god Woolie is going to try and be reasonable in this game, isn't he?
[3:15:06] <yeeyeyee> I fully expect Woolie to opt into every political ideology and shitpost as hard as possible
[3:15:11] <sirtommygunn> I think DE does an incredible job of giving you an honest perspective on each ideology. It doesn't shy away from the whole of any belief, even the shitty parts of the author's own beliefs and the positives of the opposed ideals
[3:15:23] <honterthompson> Woolie's going to say "you know what, this Measurehead guy's making some pretty good points"
[3:15:26] <%toolofparanoia> Empty Gief!
[3:15:28] <%Blackleafx> @ingman112 as I said before, if Woolie goes moralist its gonna be pretty hillarious when he learns how psyched up they are about religion
[3:15:28] <nomos42> That sounds more gross than it si
[3:15:38] <%JusTTheGuyYouNeed> Woolie is going to take like 2 year to beat this game, right ?
[3:15:41] <%maenos2> an attractive encephalopathy
[3:15:46] <gryffinp> To be fair religion in DE's world is... weird.
[3:15:46] <jorniev> at the end of the day corruption is the bane of any political stance
[3:15:48] <+RushUnplugged> so how about that AoT ending huh? *runs away from live grenade*
[3:15:57] <%Ranryu692> Depending on how much longer you plan on streaming, I think you're almost out of what you can say to her without your badge/fulfilling her request
[3:15:59] <chaingrabss> the game also lets you get fucked up and not care about politics, which is cool lol
[3:16:00] <%Blackleafx> ok the jack guy is making me regret calling the chat reasonable
[3:16:02] <%Blackleafx> lol
[3:16:02] <%toolofparanoia> I was prepared for it, didn't know about it, but im loving every bit of this convo
[3:16:12] <%Blackleafx> @magboost dude
[3:16:14] <8hoursofdrugs> Wernicke's encephalopathy from being a huge alcoholic
[3:16:17] <aiutare47> @Ranryu692 cant he do the thought and get some more?
[3:16:19] <nomos42> @Blackleafx one guy!
[3:16:22] <%maskedsongbird> *All of Martinaise*? That's...a pretty grand statement.
[3:16:25] <+Jiggisnipe> damn she's read me

[3:16:35] <gryffinp> Oh necktie

[3:17:13] <+Daedalus119> @magboost is it surprising to you that us mentally ill people would be offended by being associated with nazism?
[3:17:14] <penitentpendant> @cornybones8066 You have to have high Inland when you pick it up, it's EXTREMELY easy to miss
[3:17:23] <@SoFarFetched> Thanks Claw.

[3:37:58] <j___a___c___k___> that man escaped
[3:38:06] <penitentpendant> @sirtommygunn That's sort of the problem with Phys. You have a lot of 'trouble' stats. Half-Light makes you jump the gun, Electro gives poor impulse control. However Electro DOES let you 'read' druggies and know about drug trade.
[3:38:07] <cornybones8066> That Man.

[3:39:18] <%SveriSageAdvice> big proggos

[3:39:33] <@StridentSong> Lookin fucking swank there Harry

[3:39:42] <penitentpendant> @Blackleafx If you fail the smoker, you can go to the front door and use AUTH to get in. Since Pat's AUTH is in the toilet the smoker was the better path.
[3:39:44] <+swesterly> save the game
[3:39:45] <%Blackleafx> Gotcha, thanks

[4:18:47] <thetunnelhomer> Better question is, what is the best Trial and why is it The Dying Gasp.
[4:18:49] <penitentpendant> The number of tanks that overpull on those first two pulls...
[4:18:49] <%luftraumm1> amaurot is the best
[4:18:55] <@SoFarFetched> How do you feel between Castrum and Praetorium, Pat?
[4:19:04] <+RowenCleric> stormblood has some good dungeons
[4:19:07] <$RealThiele> journey to the moon in the void ark plx
[4:19:15] <%WhereIsWill> amourot is the edgiest one in the game, and the goat
[4:19:22] <@SoFarFetched> yeah I agree
[4:19:28] <Psyramics> they're both dull, I don't even bother with MSQ roulette anymore I can't stand it
[4:19:29] <$QueequegTheater> Praetorium also gives like 80% extra XP
[4:19:31] <@SoFarFetched> I say as Im st ill doing my nonstop prae runs.
[4:19:32] <%Monkeyweed21> Neverreap is da best dungeon

[4:19:37] <Thepothero> Antitower is mine
[4:19:40] <%luftraumm1> after ypu do it once it gets a bit dull yes
[4:19:41] <%Agami23> bosses where you have to do mechanics are good only when you dont have to wait forever like castrum
[4:19:46] <Thepothero> Love that dungeon
[4:19:46] <$QueequegTheater> RIP to the dogmaster :(
[4:19:52] <penitentpendant> The number of times I've been the last person alive on the final boss in Amaurot...
[4:20:00] <Klefth> Antitower is pretty cool. Also gets bonus points for Ziggy
[4:20:05] <%WhereIsWill> oh yeah haukke manor rules too
[4:20:17] <%kainhighwind1990> @Klefth also Calcabrina

[4:20:24] <%Agami23> anti-tower is cool
[4:20:25] <vilecrois> It does make it easier to forgive tho
[4:20:33] <%walternatorz> you can just send the money, no need for apologies
[4:20:37] <+allups> i dunno im just talking bs
[4:20:37] <%Maids4lyfe> <3
[4:20:38] <$Dakuu75> too nice a guy, for THIS chat
[4:20:42] <%weissguard> Meridanium was where you fight that one character in white armor that works for Gaius, yeah? Or was I just completely misremembering? Cause that was a doozy
[4:20:45] <penitentpendant> It helps, a lot
[4:20:46] <%za7az> @walternatorz LUL
[4:20:49] <%AzureGale> Just do it
[4:20:50] <%maskedsongbird> The money was incidental, I'd have done it anyway, lol
[4:20:51] <@SoFarFetched> Chat needs the niceness.
[4:20:52] <RetributionP> in castrum I can just make metal gear memes while he hops in the Ultima weapon
[4:20:56] <+allups> its the good thing to do
[4:20:56] <$QueequegTheater> But I'm not wrong
[4:20:59] <Visorak6> Yeah even if it doesnt make up for it it helps lessen the bad blood
[4:20:59] <susukouhai> its ok to be crybaby poopy pants if u apologise
[4:21:00] <SovPho> And not "I'm sorry you feel that way"
[4:21:01] <balthazar758> he's good guy, not one guy
[4:21:02] <+Promessa_EX> unless you're right
[4:21:12] <KaiserMario> Pat internalizes "Sorry Streamer"
[4:21:14] <penitentpendant> Fake apologies make things SO MUCH WORSE
[4:21:18] <%za7az> Good advice Pat
[4:21:20] <$RealThiele> sorry you feel that way LUL

[4:21:26] <+FerdytheNerdy> Yo DMX died
[4:21:29] <iosephe> Even if it's trivial petty bullshit
[4:21:31] <%Monkeyweed21> agree to disagree
[4:21:35] <RetributionP> gaius is just senetor Armstrong
[4:21:38] <+bapposbungers> One of my teachers told me to always apologize before it's too late. You never know when it my help.
[4:21:44] <Psyramics> you didn't do anything wrong in that case
[4:21:50] <$RealThiele> sure it does
[4:21:51] <Psyramics> its just someone being a shit and you not putting up with it
[4:21:51] <%Deft_Thought> You would support red pants.
[4:21:53] <penitentpendant> Red Pants, the Red Pill of clothing?
[4:21:53] <$Dakuu75> wut, lol. dude, he sounds tired now
[4:22:11] <$RealThiele> well its 11:30 edt
