This will affect any of the features that run ads, display sub counts, or update the stream's title and category.

[0:12:50] <%Monkeyweed21> @greatspaceadventure no i mean its physically impossible you have to at least squat a bit for your bowels to void cuz bipedalism is a bunch of wierd bullshit
[0:12:51] <thelonechris> So did Pat blow his asshole out?
[0:12:52] <%SaiyanShoto> Did you hunt it?
[0:12:53] <%PhantomMiG> Pat is the issue you have with super metriod the feel of movement
[0:12:55] <%AncelDeLambert> they do, yes
[0:12:57] <redwidow1358> Awww I bet he LOVES to chew all over that thing
[0:13:02] <%NigelSchnauzerpug> Pat killed a moose and stole their antler.
[0:13:03] <+lastradish> I mean yeah. Once a year
[0:13:03] <%tinytinykittycat> how do you know it was a deer?
[0:13:07] <%AncelDeLambert> many species of deer shed their antlers yearly
[0:13:07] <%tusk102> deers lose their antlers sometimes
[0:13:12] <%dekkitout> How would you rank your dog's chewing?
[0:13:13] <%RealThiele> nom
[0:13:16] <%Dakuu75> @PatStaresAt when is gief gonna level up to a Moose antler
[0:13:19] <%UvBenServed> He's gonna throw that at you for sure
[0:13:21] <greatspaceadventure> be careful with what kind of bone you give Zangief, some types are much more fibery (and therefore dangerous) than others
[0:13:23] <%PocketBearIllustrator> that isn't gonna wreck Zangief's teeth, is it?
[0:13:25] <@Ranryu692> they lose their EARS?
[0:13:26] <%hewlettfan96> How did you blow his arsehole out???
[0:13:27] <%anticrust> anticrust subscribed at Tier 1. They've subscribed for 48 months! OH Boy, I sure have been DREADING this stream.........................................................................................................................................................................................hi pat
[0:13:29] <%twohitgood> and then they grow new antlers in a bloody mess that's metal as fuck.
[0:13:29] <+lastradish> their ears?
[0:13:32] <%dekkitout> When moose regrow theirs, it's pretty gross
[0:13:32] <redwidow1358> Yeah, gotta be careful with the choking hazards and whatnot
[0:13:32] <rommlll> Pat the horned blurple
[0:13:34] <@tizz86> and eat the felt
[0:13:37] <%RealThiele> ears LUL
[0:13:40] <thelonechris> Have you ever seen a deer shed velvet? It looks metal as fuck
[0:13:42] <dodgy_dingo_> and they grow velvet on their antlers
[0:13:42] <@PeachSaliva> @pocketbearillustrator nah, vet and trainer recommended this, just need to supervise
[0:13:45] <Shwepie> Deer shed antlers every year.
[0:13:52] <%twohitgood> when deer shed the felt off their antlers, it's gnarly looking.
[0:13:55] <+reaver93> You look lovely today Pat. Hope you are doing well!
[0:14:05] <%AncelDeLambert> did you boil the antler or anything?... do antlers carry anything nasty?
[0:14:05] <%hewlettfan96> Jesus Christ
[0:14:07] <greatspaceadventure> my puppy stole an oxtail bone from the trash and almost broke a tooth on a tiny aperture in it

[0:14:21] <%SaiyanShoto> We used to have random antlers in our backyard a lot
[0:14:23] <%Mr_Pylon> that's all horns
[0:14:24] <+D00msDayDan> that is what they use antlers for
[0:14:24] <%holydeviant1> outdoors of couse
[0:14:25] <%AncelDeLambert> deer are awesome

[0:14:41] <%greasypete00> think about the rocks on their feet too those would fuck you up
[0:14:41] <@tizz86> deer are assholes
[0:14:41] <%NigelSchnauzerpug> Would you mess with a moose @PatStaresAt

[0:14:44] <%valriot> its also covered in flesh, and they rip it off and it looks horrifying
[0:14:45] <+lastradish> just attack the does
[0:14:47] <%SinnerEbru> doe r pwetty
[0:14:47] <%SaiyanShoto> Deer kill more people than bears
[0:14:48] <%SuckerPunchSyd> @twohitgood wait the deer or the antler?
[0:14:49] <rommlll> antlers are bone
[0:14:50] <$realm_forge> They’re also full of blood
[0:14:52] <theanora1> you can still yell at the female deer
[0:14:53] <BigLoserJosh> bantler
[0:14:54] <miabyte> is this the first metroid stream?
[0:14:57] <redwidow1358> The deer would probably just run from you anyway, unless it's like super pissed off
[0:14:58] <+ThomasOfTroy> Deer shedding antlers is some nightmare fuel
[0:14:59] <%hewlettfan96> Antlers
[0:15:03] <+lastradish> @NigelSchnauzerpug why would anyone ever
[0:15:04] <LoneFonte> second one
[0:15:08] <Anonipan1> Bone is nature's rock @patstaresat
[0:15:09] <rommlll> bone talk
[0:15:11] <%dekkitout> If anything, he repaired the antler
[0:15:11] <redwidow1358> This is Dread stream 2
[0:15:12] <SaltyAzteca> @miabyte Second

[0:15:15] <%PhantomMiG> @miabyte No second
[0:15:19] <%SuckerPunchSyd> Thats a strong antler
[0:15:23] <%grimr2004> Deer rock lmfaoo
[0:15:27] <KnivesEve> is this the legendary Other M stream
[0:15:28] <@Ranryu692> deer rock vs rock lobster. who wins?
[0:15:28] <+madspaniardbaker> antler is made of the same stuff as fingernails and hair
[0:15:30] <%Dakuu75> there's a new movie coming out called "Antlers" I'm looking forward to.

[0:18:24] <%dekkitout> You have been got
[0:18:24] <redwidow1358> @tusk102 It was kind of terrible at launch but it got a pass because it pioneered a genre. It's aged pretty badly.
[0:18:27] <%captain_thickthighs> I tried but I can't do ff!4's game play style. I feel like being gluten allergy and everyone loves baking
[0:18:28] <liammichealryan> You all heard about what's going on with Aeon Must Die?

[0:19:57] <ChaoticDaKiller> 100% completing Metroid Dread is fun too except for the mind goblins compelling me to color in the entire map
[0:19:58] <Shwepie> The only correct answer is: Not anymore!
[0:19:59] <rommlll> you need to say it is indeed poggers
[0:20:00] <IwishIwasTaylorSwift> it makes you wide peepo happy
[0:20:00] <%valriot> Divorce speedrun

[0:20:56] <VirtuaRailith> welcome to the paladin club pat. I've been here the entire time
[0:21:09] <quetzalcoatlusart> Still can't believe unmend gives you a 5 second reduction on plunge cooldown, best trait in the game. So op, of course they didn't give blood weapon any qol
[0:21:11] <%Monkeyweed21> it makes sense after the opposite happened with Shadowbringers
[0:21:13] <@TheYellowcouch> i'd go gnb
[0:21:13] <%hewlettfan96> Fart
[0:21:18] <%TheHateFish> They're all massive weebs and want the Unlimited Blade Works memes
[0:21:19] <%holydeviant1> Well, you like big meaty weapojns
[0:21:19] <%NigelSchnauzerpug> Having never played FF, it's like everyone is speaking a different language.
[0:21:22] <%anticrust> Not Gunbreakor?
[0:21:26] <%Shady_Squid> The fact that DRK got a move literally called Shadowbringer is sick
[0:21:28] <%JoshManVGH> Not Gun Tank?
[0:21:29] <Blank9> paladin got so much and was already fine
[0:21:29] <%twohitgood> my first job was making pizzas.
[0:21:31] <%HollowedIdjit> Warrior for Life. AXE.
[0:21:32] <%Puhff> BUT THE LORE
[0:21:46] <VirtuaRailith> I feel like Warrior is appropriate after you finish shadowbringer.
[0:21:48] <KnivesEve> im just giving my drk white armor
[0:21:50] <%valriot> To be clear, I main tank and they all look like fantastic, DRK is just a bit ehhhhh.. change Living Dead please

[0:22:20] <@TheYellowcouch> based
[0:22:27] <%cobalt_phoenix_> very true
[0:22:31] <%SuckerPunchSyd> Except MNK Kappa thats two hands
[0:22:32] <%Shady_Squid> Warriors got shields, Paladins got self heals. What did Dark Knight get?
[0:22:32] <+LastHazzerd> agree
[0:22:33] <%Dakuu75> "sword and board" lol
[0:22:36] <T_Sasquatch> True
[0:22:40] <TenguGemini> what about when it's a weapon that can be one OR two handed?
[0:22:41] <+LastHazzerd> that's why Monster Hunter is great
[0:22:44] <%curiour> New Dragoon changes are *chef kiss*
[0:22:46] <%DashXero> Like Monster Hunter
[0:22:47] <%Profmcstevie> The MH image is almost always Greatsword
[0:22:48] <quetzalcoatlusart> who cares about living dead literally Requiescat and Inner Release are both on charges now, why is Blood Weapon still just 10 seconds when it's the one that needed charges the most?
[0:22:49] <%Puhff> yeAH mh
[0:22:50] <%echobee_tv> Sword and Bored
[0:22:54] <%holydeviant1> more like sword and boredom

[0:36:39] <%Sirtimbob> I paid 6 subs for this?
[0:36:52] <tmvct1> Zelda is an RPG
[0:37:20] <%JoshManVGH> @nopebadguy Yes. Bloodborne is the best 3D Castlevania game to date
[0:37:33] <ChaoticDaKiller> back on track
[0:37:34] <hollumdusk> Dark Souls takes a lot of Metroidvanias, but it's action rpg side is still the main focus
[0:37:46] <PirateMike_> Zelda is kinda of a girls name why would they call him that?
[0:37:48] <Make_me_mad> @JoshManVGH Acting like Lament of Innocence doesn't exist.
[0:37:52] <rommlll> ds is action rpg yes
[0:37:52] <GarbageQueenEllie> Metrlloib
[0:37:59] <%Dakuu75> I was watching Max do some Shinespark puzzles last night. and some of those are what I would call "bull shit"

[0:43:06] <jorniev> she walks out of that train like she is ready to kill
[0:43:08] <%AncelDeLambert> yes
[0:43:08] <jorniev> YES
[0:43:09] <%MrP33Ps> Yes
[0:43:10] <%superc37> yes
[0:43:10] <%echobee_tv> Oh yeah
[0:43:10] <@OfficioPrefectusCorgi> always
[0:43:12] <tmvct1> yeeeeep
[0:43:12] <jbrachob> ye
[0:43:13] <Qsmash_> it's a little too good yes
[0:43:13] <Saltmeisterr> yes
[0:43:13] <kyuubisonic> yes
[0:43:14] <%NopeBadguy> especially for mercurysteam
[0:43:15] <%JoshManVGH> Just a tad
[0:43:15] <tanarath> Yes
[0:43:15] <%blankwaffle> yes
[0:43:15] <Shwepie> @superc37 Normal people use the stairs, Samus uses the airducts.
[0:43:15] <+LastHazzerd> Yes
[0:43:15] <hollumdusk> yes!
[0:43:17] <RaidenRising> yes
[0:43:18] <%A_Mighty_Walrus> boy is it
[0:43:18] <%MrP33Ps> It's super werid
[0:43:18] <Zezuar> yes i love it
[0:43:18] <%Zeikier> it's too good so we shouldn't like it pchB
[0:43:18] <%Mr_Pylon> Bursting with money
[0:43:19] <%Dakuu75> well yes but, not ont he switch
[0:43:19] <Skyjet24_> this game doesnt deserve to be such high quality, and im so glad it is
[0:43:19] <TenguGemini> This is easily one of the best Metroid games, it's kind of astounding how good it is
[0:43:21] <redwidow1358> I do get the feeling this game is extremely high quality
[0:43:21] <$ringabal> Gee, Pat, what gave you that idea?
[0:43:21] <jorniev> its runs so good
[0:43:24] <%Saadi90> its fantastic
[0:43:24] <jman13131313> YES
[0:43:25] <Blank9> it stands out when you sequence break especially
[0:43:27] <DoctorMulholland> Oh yeah Nintendo gave Mercurysteam WAY more money for this one
[0:43:27] <placeholder03> YES!!!!!!
[0:43:27] <%GarbageNirvana> MercurySteam put in work
[0:43:30] <%holydeviant1> Certainly worth 60 dollars ha ha ha fuck twitter
[0:43:31] <%solracc25> yes
[0:43:33] <%greasypete00> it's strange how much it exceeds expectations
[0:43:34] <Tracazoid> IMO that's kind of how Metroid is outside of the ones that shall not be named
[0:43:38] <%echobee_tv> Finally, a good $60 game.
[0:43:39] <Blank9> I can't find a way to get softlocked no matter what
[0:43:42] <+bladeworksmaster> Mercury Steam was held back by Konami being Konami, I think we can see in hindsight
[0:43:42] <%GarbageNirvana> And Nintendo probably made them put in more work
[0:43:44] <%solracc25> They needed to make it gangbusters
[0:43:45] <%tusk102> bursting with money
[0:43:46] <%UberKingKai> Considering who made it yeah
[0:43:47] <%AncelDeLambert> I hate those flying spike assholes
[0:43:48] <%darklordfodder> It's so high quality that I'm afraid of Nintendo fucking up the next one.
[0:43:49] <%ShinobiPhoenix> it's almost like it's worth the $60s
[0:43:49] <%JoshManVGH> The integration of cutscenes and gameplay is top fucking notch
[0:43:49] <+bob_gray> Samus Returns was pretty good for a gameboy game remake
[0:43:52] <Louie_Salmon> Like one of the best games Nintendo has ever published, possibly
[0:43:53] <%MrP33Ps> How is this the same studio that made Clive Barker's Jericho?
[0:43:58] <%Beetlewins> I think for a game that was clearly made to cover the Metroid Prime 4 gap that this game is absurdly polished
[0:43:59] <%holydeviant1> HA HA EMMI TIME
[0:44:00] <Zezuar> death
[0:44:00] <%nosubstancex> A coworker told me that this was one of the best feeling side scrolling games he has ever played.
[0:44:03] <%tusk102> rip
[0:44:03] <%NopeBadguy> stab
[0:44:06] <@TheYellowcouch> hey look it's a yellow submarine
[0:44:07] <AntifaCatboy> adumF
[0:44:13] <ChaoticDaKiller> DON'T GET SEEN IN THE WATER
[0:44:13] <+LastHazzerd> deceptive water
[0:44:14] <%RealThiele> RIP
[0:44:15] <SaltyAzteca> Id think parrying would be slower underwater
[0:44:16] <+Mrbaconator> oh no the robot male impregnated samus
[0:44:17] <%greasypete00> very generous checkpoints also
[0:44:17] <%peachy996> Welcome back says Emmi
[0:44:20] <%Dakuu75> ...
[0:44:21] <Tracazoid> What about with a needle?
[0:44:22] <+rbakervv> @PatStaresAt cloak doesn't work after you've been spotted
[0:44:23] <%dekkitout> Define quickly
[0:44:23] <+NickHatesSnow> yeah okay
[0:44:24] <%MrP33Ps> Noted
[0:44:25] <%cooldude69xx> Got it pat
[0:44:25] <%MegadBlitz> noted!
[0:44:25] <%superc37> slow and painful, got it
[0:44:26] <%blankwaffle> the underwater timing is tough
[0:44:26] <@TheYellowcouch> sure pat
[0:44:29] <%Zeikier> yeah that scene from Saving Private Ryan sucked ass
[0:44:30] <%peachy996> So like in the butt?
[0:44:31] <Zezuar> rapid stab
[0:44:31] <%Saadi90> good to know
[0:44:32] <%king_wragles> Would medium speed be acceptable?
[0:44:32] <TioXyco> stab slower, got it
[0:44:32] <pixelkenj> emmi basically has a big syringe
[0:44:33] <%cooldude69xx> It's the least we can do
[0:44:35] <%Monkeyweed21> no Pierre le Fou deaths?
[0:44:36] <%NopeBadguy> is that so you can parry it?
[0:44:37] <doggieo> how quick
[0:44:37] <+Mrbaconator> can it be with a syringe?
[0:44:38] <+BlueLunecy> See what we can dp
[0:44:38] <%JoshManVGH> Uh how about just not stabbed?
[0:44:38] <Faithless_Zealot> @PatStaresAt But where whould you like to be stabbed?
[0:44:39] <T_Sasquatch> Slowly.  Got it
[0:44:40] <@TheYellowcouch> I'll stab you in the liver instead
[0:44:43] <Psyramics> but if we stab slow, parry window biger
[0:44:45] <%cvp5127> long and painful got it
[0:44:51] <%Beetlewins> Sorry but I ascribe to the Prince of Thieves method and will use a spoon
[0:44:51] <+dante_must_die_exe> the slowest of stabs
[0:44:55] <%darklordfodder> Stab slow with dull knife, I got your back.
[0:44:59] <jorniev> like that new anime where a dude gets stabed in the neck really slowly
[0:45:02] <jbrachob> how about we give you SLOWMO from Dread and then stab you?
[0:45:04] <lethallylactic> monkaS
[0:45:05] <SaltyAzteca> YOU SEE NOTHING
[0:45:05] <Zezuar> monkaS
[0:45:08] <%twohitgood> okay....so note to self: stab pat quickly and repeatedly.
[0:45:08] <%NopeBadguy> you have chosen: slow and horrible
[0:45:08] <%Dakuu75> there's no QTE for REAL LIFE Pat
[0:45:18] <%RealThiele> nyoooo
[0:45:18] <%ScreamLord> @PatStaresAt You can destroy those proxy mines with the run melee
[0:45:23] <%darklordfodder> Pat Stabs At
[0:45:26] <Zezuar> YEA!
[0:45:28] <LordOfThePoultry> PogChamp
[0:45:32] <%MrP33Ps> Life has invisible QTEs
[0:45:35] <redwidow1358> GO PAT
[0:45:40] <%ace_cfa44> ace_cfa44 subscribed with Prime. They've subscribed for 36 months! hey pat, finally beat yakuza zero after picking it up around 2017, now I have to go back and complete the side stuff. Also wanted to say the dishonored streams have been really good even though the mind goblins haven't shown up from what I've seen
[0:45:40] <%ShinobiPhoenix> I wouldn't say checkpoints are generous, they are just before bosses and Emmi, if you die in the main world, you lose that progress
[0:45:50] <%darklordfodder> I fail so many life QTEs
[0:46:16] <tmvct1> Aunt Brain nooooo
[0:46:16] <%Dakuu75> reminds me of that bleach episode of the guy who was stabbed and it took millions of years for him to feel it. (that shit still haunts me.)
[0:46:17] <%JoshManVGH> Time for Brain Gun!
[0:46:21] <%darklordfodder> I knocked a nearly full soda can off my desk and sprayed the walls and floor with most of a soda can
[0:46:22] <Blank9> emmi's fun to just run around
[0:46:31] <%echobee_tv> Are these baby brains versus a Mother Brain?
[0:46:37] <Zezuar> time to murder the robot
[0:46:42] <Saltmeisterr> BRAIN BLAST
[0:46:44] <+youngjwilliams> Have we gotten to the mid-point story beat?
[0:46:44] <%Mr_Pylon> brains love having eyeballs
[0:46:50] <%AncelDeLambert> time to murder speed boi
[0:46:50] <%Monkeyweed21> @echobee_tv daughter brains
[0:46:53] <%holydeviant1> @echobee_tv Same tech. Wetware computers.
[0:47:00] <%AncelDeLambert> LUL
[0:47:08] <%Bailey__Gaming> Adam : "I'm going to Take you for a ride"
[0:47:08] <%ShinobiPhoenix> @echobee_tv Prime had other Brains too
[0:47:11] <+megaman_sentinel> so who created mother brain?
[0:47:12] <Louie_Salmon> Immediately
[0:47:22] <@Ranryu692> time stop?
[0:47:24] <doggieo> Samus has such nice stances
[0:47:38] <Zezuar> oh geez

[0:47:48] <%tusk102> oh lord
[0:47:52] <%ShinobiPhoenix> @megaman_sentinel Chozo created Mother Brain to regulate Zebes, Federation tried to copy the design
[0:47:54] <%AncelDeLambert> that would NOT help
[0:47:54] <+Pachi3000> we need time stop
[0:47:56] <redwidow1358> Oh fuck he's taking on the fast one
[0:48:00] <Zezuar> YO SICK

[0:49:11] <%ShinobiPhoenix> the cooldown is fast enough that it might as well be a single clean go to be safe
[0:49:15] <roboyuji> I had one sneak up behind me while charging
[0:49:16] <RaidenRising> go fast
[0:49:21] <%Dakuu75> I keep expecting new lore to be like. "We built the EMMI to kill Samus, if she ever turned evil."
[0:49:25] <%ShinobiPhoenix> and it's VERY easy to be safe, risk taking isn't necessary
[0:49:30] <+Pachi3000> vineSanic
[0:49:30] <%GarbageNirvana> watFast tieSonci
[0:49:43] <mar_krow> Can’t believe the Emmi got supered
[0:49:43] <%ShinobiPhoenix> the first codified mention of Shinesparking
[0:49:50] <%R3Roundabout> Y + B to shinespark in the air
[0:49:55] <%Bailey__Gaming> SHINE SPARKU
[0:49:57] <+NickHatesSnow> shinespark is always with speed
[0:49:57] <SaltyAzteca> This is the first time ive seen a tutorial telling you about Shinespark
[0:49:57] <hassanico2> ???
[0:49:59] <+Pachi3000> enjoy shinespark puzzles
[0:50:00] <LoneFonte> you sure will
[0:50:01] <tmvct1> 19 years late tutorial
[0:50:03] <hassanico2> Shinespark was never its own upgrade
[0:50:04] <Blank9> there's so much shit with it
[0:50:06] <Treasure_Vault> You'll have plenty of opportunity to GIT GUD
[0:50:06] <Saltmeisterr> U CAN ALSO WALL JUMP WITH IT
[0:50:10] <+Cafe_Spider> some of the shinespark puzzles are brutal
[0:50:13] <%RealThiele> much tilting
[0:50:15] <TheHotStuven> Also Ball Spark
[0:50:20] <greatspaceadventure> you genuinely nailed that EMMI section in a way i haven't seen anyone else do much less myself
[0:50:25] <%GarbageNirvana> Once it's stored, you hit B to start it and then you get like a second to pick a direction
[0:50:29] <redwidow1358> This is locked to 8 directions so don't get too pressed about the control stick being 360°
[0:50:29] <marvel877> I think he's confusing Shinespark with Screwattack.
[0:50:30] <@PeachSaliva> Apologies for the barking. We are doing some training exercises. Thank you for your patience. He is trying.
[0:50:30] <@OfficioPrefectusCorgi> Up top
[0:50:37] <Calek> you don't need that much
[0:50:46] <Treasure_Vault> Tell Gief to bark louder
[0:50:50] <TheTakkster> @PeachSaliva What's he training you to do?
[0:50:50] <%SuckerPunchSyd> No worries! He is a good boy
[0:50:51] <tmvct1> uh oh
[0:50:52] <SaltyAzteca> Just run
[0:50:54] <Treasure_Vault> Call his barks weak
[0:50:59] <redwidow1358> Gief is a good boy
[0:51:00] <+RelikaNox> Needs bigger borks
[0:51:06] <%darklordfodder> fuckin sick
[0:51:13] <%greasypete00> you can also shine as ball
[0:51:15] <@PeachSaliva> @thetakkster haha I know right? I’m rewarding him when he is quiet
[0:51:16] <+NickHatesSnow> NOW DO IT IN BALL FORM
[0:51:16] <%ShinobiPhoenix> to do it in the air from the ground, it's SPIN junp, then attack to free yourself from the spin
[0:51:21] <%RealThiele> E
[0:51:21] <%ShinobiPhoenix> and jump to activate
[0:51:24] <TioXyco> you cn
[0:51:26] <TioXyco> *can
[0:51:26] <SaltyAzteca> Yes you can
[0:51:28] <%Deft_Thought> Ballspark
[0:51:29] <%greasypete00> you have to ready a shine and then ball
[0:51:30] <snivins> store it
[0:51:31] <+Pachi3000> store the spark and then become ball
[0:51:32] <LoneFonte> you don't have to shinespark right away
[0:51:35] <Grizzytron> You shift to ball after storing the shinespark
[0:51:35] <%retrohazard> shinespark do the big boss damage too
[0:51:36] <Zezuar> Charge it , store , ball mode
[0:51:36] <%ShinobiPhoenix> yes, Shinespark as a ball was a PROBLEM for Max
[0:51:36] <TioXyco> sine ready, ball, spark
[0:51:38] <ChaoticDaKiller> you have to store a shine spark and then turn into a ball
[0:51:38] <%RealThiele> shine then ball
[0:51:39] <+youngjwilliams> does he know the wall jump tech?
[0:51:40] <@PeachSaliva> @thetakkster trainer told us it’s a positive way to get them to ask for attention in a positive way :)
[0:51:42] <redwidow1358> Hold the charge, morph into ball, press jump
[0:51:42] <AoiRob> charge it first. thenball
[0:51:45] <%charp35> You can stock the shine spark you don't have to use it immediately
[0:51:47] <snivins> dont press b
[0:51:48] <%A_Mighty_Walrus> you just press down when running
[0:51:50] <%VictorVonLouche> you gotta shine spark kneel then ball
[0:51:50] <TheHotStuven> Crouch
[0:51:53] <Blank9> dpad down to store
[0:51:55] <%NigelSchnauzerpug> @PeachSaliva Don't apologize, you must train Zangief to become big and strong and defend the world against evil.
[0:51:56] <%ShinobiPhoenix> ball with ZL
[0:51:57] <+bladeworksmaster> store, ball, spark
[0:51:58] <SaltyAzteca> Shine, crouch, ball
[0:52:00] <@TheYellowcouch> I see now why woolie spent like 8 hours on this
[0:52:00] <%GarbageNirvana> Yeah you just hit down to store
[0:52:00] <%VictorVonLouche> kneel
[0:52:01] <Zezuar> store
[0:52:01] <%cvp5127> down to store
[0:52:02] <LoneFonte> just crouch while running
[0:52:08] <%Beetlewins> You only press down to get the shine, then ball, then b
[0:52:08] <+Pachi3000> well that too
[0:52:08] <TheTakkster> @PeachSaliva Best of luck with the stubbern little dork.  And Geif
[0:52:09] <%GarbageNirvana> And there's that too
[0:52:09] <+bladeworksmaster> OH WHAT
[0:52:13] <%JoshManVGH> If you press down after boost triggers you store shinespark
[0:52:13] <snivins> Dont press B @PatStaresAt
[0:52:13] <Psykoknight65> you have to crouch first
[0:52:14] <+bladeworksmaster> I didn't know it could do that
[0:52:15] <%Maids4lyfe> TURN PURPLE THEN CROUCH INTO BALL @PatStaresAt
[0:52:16] <%ShinobiPhoenix> Boost, CHARGE then ball
[0:52:17] <+Pachi3000> but we mean to store it
[0:52:19] <%VictorVonLouche> nono
[0:52:20] <@OfficioPrefectusCorgi> tilt stick down
[0:52:24] <TioXyco> get a boost, press down to store it, ball and spark
[0:52:26] <%ShinobiPhoenix> Boost, Down to charge, ball
[0:52:27] <DoctorMulholland> Hold down to stop, THEN ball, THEN spark.
[0:52:27] <@GeneralSCPatton> You hold the shine for several seconds before you have to fire off
[0:52:28] <Grizzytron> He'll figure it out eventually.
[0:52:28] <%zarkazeon> purple is shine spark
[0:52:29] <redwidow1358> More often than not you'll want to store the charge and then become a ball
[0:52:30] <TheAzureOracle> wtf you can do that??
[0:52:31] <%tusk102> shine, crouch, ball. dont press b @PatStaresAt
[0:52:33] <%Monkeyweed21> store it
[0:52:33] <iroh20> gotta go fast
[0:52:33] <+youngjwilliams> Wall jump doesnt stop momentum too
[0:52:35] <%solracc25> down and ball jump
[0:52:36] <%VictorVonLouche> shine FULL STOP CROUCH THEN BALL
[0:52:38] <%TheCallousKing> Metroid Sonic
[0:52:39] <tmvct1> rip
[0:52:40] <%NopeBadguy> @PatStaresAt You have to crouch to store shine
[0:52:41] <%ShinobiPhoenix> the spark is storing energy
[0:52:42] <LoneFonte> run, then down
[0:52:43] <SaltyAzteca> When you crouch you turn purplr
[0:52:43] <%Saadi90> you can store the purple spark
[0:52:47] <+Pachi3000> you get like 5 seconds
[0:52:48] <SaltyAzteca> Thats it
[0:52:48] <%greasypete00> and then ball and use it
[0:52:48] <%blankwaffle> read the description for the ability pat
[0:52:52] <%tusk102> there ya go
[0:52:53] <%Saadi90> ther you go
[0:52:53] <%Dakuu75> yep
[0:52:53] <TwistParabola> yeee boi
[0:52:54] <DoctorMulholland> For a few seconds
[0:52:56] <%WordsHere> That's always how it works lol
[0:52:57] <%retrohazard> for a few seconds, yes
[0:52:58] <%Beetlewins> Pressing down gives you shinespark, pressing b activates it
[0:52:58] <%Maids4lyfe> FOR A SHORT TIME
[0:52:58] <TioXyco> you keep it fr 5 secs
[0:52:58] <marvel877> for like 5 seconds, yeah.
[0:52:58] <%ShinobiPhoenix> you always have been able to
[0:52:59] <%tusk102> then ball
[0:53:00] <%JoshManVGH> Yeah now do whatever you need with it
[0:53:00] <SaltyAzteca> You cant keep it for very long
[0:53:01] <LoneFonte> then neutral jump
[0:53:04] <%Monkeyweed21> Pat cant read lol
[0:53:05] <TheAzureOracle> For five or six seconds yes
[0:53:06] <tanarath> for 5 seconds
[0:53:07] <%ShinobiPhoenix> litearlly since Super
[0:53:09] <%tusk102> 5 seconds @PatStaresAt
[0:53:09] <+AntithesisEK> signature feature of shine/booster
[0:53:10] <Blank9> only triggers off a neutral jump
[0:53:14] <+D00msDayDan> you can hit Y+B to shinespark in the air
[0:53:14] <%A_Mighty_Walrus> you activate the shinespark with a neutral jump, effectively
[0:53:14] <%NopeBadguy> now try it as a ball
[0:53:15] <jorniev> tahts a lot more seconds thatn i thought
[0:53:16] <miabyte> press b in that mode then hold in a direction @patstaresat
[0:53:16] <Aydarkzero> he's learning the tech
[0:53:20] <%blankwaffle> it's directional
[0:53:22] <@GeneralSCPatton> NEUTRAL JUMP AND THEN DIRECTION
[0:53:22] <tmvct1> CRACY TALK
[0:53:23] <pth88> it was in returns wasnt it
[0:53:24] <%NopeBadguy> @PatStaresAt Did you not play Fusion?
[0:53:24] <%Maids4lyfe> IT'S BEEN SINCE SUPER
[0:53:27] <TourettesPlays> Super Metroid ain't so great to play but hot damn are the hidden mechanics the absolute fucking best
[0:53:27] <Psykoknight65> after storing hit jump and then you can direct it
[0:53:29] <+NickHatesSnow> Every Metroid past super has it
[0:53:30] <Saltmeisterr> @PatStaresAt u can also wall jump while running and it keeps the charge
[0:53:31] <marvel877> CRAZY
[0:53:32] <$ArcanumArcanum> Neutral Jump to unleash the spark. Can't spark out of spinning jump
[0:53:32] <Zezuar> pat fumbles at
[0:53:37] <%TheHateFish> Thin passage straight up
[0:53:37] <%ShinobiPhoenix> Super is the game that taught you how to do it, it the only game until now that gave a tutorial
[0:53:39] <LoneFonte> @Maids4lyfe first metroid he's playing
[0:53:42] <%GarbageNirvana> Pat in fact did not play Fusion I don't think
[0:53:43] <%RealThiele> welcome to your new life with shinesparking
[0:53:43] <@Moobot> Hey folks, just a reminder! If you have Twitch connected to Discord, you can access the PSA Sub-Discord. Go to your User Settings, go to Connections, and click 'Join' on the PSA server under the Twitch connection.
[0:53:43] <SaltyAzteca> @NopeBadguy He has not
[0:53:47] <%JoshManVGH> Yeah this would be super unwieldy in First Person
[0:53:47] <%greasypete00> it's very cool in this game
[0:53:48] <marvel877> Walljumping with the boost is new
[0:53:49] <+Pachi3000> and you can slide
[0:53:50] <%VictorVonLouche> you can ball up and shoot yourself
[0:53:51] <%zarkazeon> store it. then b while idle tilt stick in direction u want to fly
[0:53:51] <+youngjwilliams> Crazy tech
[0:53:55] <Maverick2736> yeah, they finally let you store the charge again like in Super
[0:53:57] <jmuster> fusion is pretty good pat you should play that one
[0:53:57] <jorniev> you mean the dash or the holding of the dash for a super jump?
[0:53:58] <marvel877> You can also slide with boosting
[0:53:59] <+youngjwilliams> ball mid air too
[0:54:02] <Explodincatz> neutral jump then move right or left after charging
[0:54:02] <%ShinobiPhoenix> very pro tip, you LOSE the charge if you Space Jump more than ONCE in the air
[0:54:03] <ChaoticDaKiller> speed boost challenge here too if you want it
[0:54:04] <+Pachi3000> the tech is mad
[0:54:07] <TheAzureOracle> Also if you shinespark into a ramp you recover speedboost which you can then shine off of again
[0:54:08] <+attoram> you can slide and also keep the charge
[0:54:09] <%blankwaffle> some parts require you to get real creative with that shine spark
[0:54:10] <%ShinobiPhoenix> that;s important to know
[0:54:10] <redwidow1358> You cannot flash Shift and keep it, but you can do a lot of stuff with it
[0:54:12] <SaltyAzteca> Youre invincible when you speed boost
[0:54:15] <%Bailey__Gaming> Gotta go fast
[0:54:21] <TioXyco> zangief! do it more!
[0:54:26] <%ShinobiPhoenix> the tech of SHinesparking is WAY more involved than I knew until this game
[0:54:27] <%darklordfodder> Speedruns of this game are going to be wild.
[0:54:33] <marvel877> YEAH
[0:54:33] <+kingmemelord97> so has pat killed on the giant murder robots ?
[0:54:33] <TioXyco> yup
[0:54:34] <Blank9> DO IT
[0:54:34] <Zezuar> YEA

[0:54:42] <%ShinobiPhoenix> Peach said she's training Gief
[0:54:45] <%A_Mighty_Walrus> FIGURE IT OUT
[0:54:45] <%ElkRiverDog> !uptime
[0:54:45] <@Moobot> @ElkRiverDog I've been playing this game for how long? Oh only 54m 54s.
[0:54:46] <Zezuar> I loved t his one
[0:54:47] <redwidow1358> Become the ballspark Pat
[0:54:50] <+Pachi3000> They really should have explained in game all the things you can do with speed boost
[0:54:50] <Psykoknight65> slide can keep the momentum as well
[0:54:52] <SaltyAzteca> YOU GON LEARN TO ZOOM ZOOM TODAY
[0:54:52] <%bravebravesrobin> Did you know about the Koei Tecmo Fatal Frame movie? Cheer500
[0:54:52] <%tusk102> learn it now
[0:54:52] <TioXyco> it's a way to learn it
[0:54:54] <%NigelSchnauzerpug> psaDogchamp psaDogchamp psaDogchamp psaDogchamp
[0:54:57] <%ShinobiPhoenix> oh it's THIS one
[0:54:58] <%WordsHere> This is one of the fun ones
[0:54:59] <miabyte> you can run into a slide
[0:55:00] <Shwepie> Trail of 100 Shinespark Puzzles begins now.
[0:55:00] <%Dakuu75> Get in the fucking Shinespark Shinji~
[0:55:01] <%solracc25> ball dash
[0:55:02] <+fetrigon> OMEGALUL
[0:55:06] <%zarkazeon> dash puzzle time!!!
[0:55:06] <%VictorVonLouche> n
[0:55:09] <Onjani> shinespark puzzles Kreygasm
[0:55:12] <DoctorMulholland> Woolie did this one the most fucked up backwards way possible AND HE ACTUALLY PULLED IT OFF
[0:55:17] <%R3Roundabout> you can keep speedboost through a wall jump
[0:55:19] <%RealThiele> cant gain spark as ball, must use stored spark to ball
[0:55:21] <SaltyAzteca> @PatStaresAt When you shinespark on a ledge you reset the speed boost
[0:55:23] <Blank9> yayaya
[0:55:23] <greatspaceadventure> did this music remind anyone else of the Hoohoo cola lab music from Mario & Luigi 1?
[0:55:28] <marvel877> Remember we said you can walljump with the speedboost
[0:55:31] <+Pachi3000> you had space there
[0:55:32] <azure_dunes> @DoctorMulholland from the top?
[0:55:33] <Saltmeisterr> slide also keeps charge pat
[0:55:34] <%VictorVonLouche> gotta shine before you jump
[0:55:36] <%ShinobiPhoenix> this one is the first one to give me trouble ot figure out, but once you ACTUALLY know what keeps the charge and what loses the charge, it's about performance
[0:55:39] <+Pachi3000> slide
[0:55:40] <tmvct1> lol
[0:55:40] <%ShinobiPhoenix> don't jump
[0:55:41] <%GarbageNirvana> Don't even have to store it for this one I don't think
[0:55:42] <@OfficioPrefectusCorgi> slide
[0:55:43] <snivins> just slide
[0:55:44] <%greasypete00> you can speed slide too
[0:55:44] <LoneFonte> ?
[0:55:44] <%cobalt_phoenix_> @DoctorMulholland so you could say... woolie figured it out?
[0:55:46] <%twohitgood> put a little extra on that one.
[0:55:47] <+NickHatesSnow> why did you go to the other room?
[0:55:47] <scarman125> slide dood
[0:55:48] <marvel877> You can slide while speedboosting
[0:55:50] <%ShinobiPhoenix> slide into the blocks
[0:55:50] <miabyte> slide
[0:55:50] <%Dakuu75> I don't think the arrows matter, does it?
[0:55:50] <TwistParabola> he's got this
[0:55:51] <ChaoticDaKiller> you can also slide while speed boosting
[0:55:51] <+attoram> You can slide with speed boost and keep the charge
[0:55:51] <%tusk102> damn
[0:55:52] <SaltyAzteca> He's beginning to believe!
[0:55:52] <+Pachi3000> that's why they're on the ground too
[0:55:52] <%preeeow> spark into stairs to run again
[0:55:55] <Shwepie> @azure_dunes From the top.
[0:55:58] <%ShinobiPhoenix> sliding keeps boost
[0:56:01] <tmvct1> oh god
[0:56:01] <+Pachi3000> no slide at the blocks
[0:56:01] <%solracc25> slide
[0:56:01] <%ShinobiPhoenix> from the other side
[0:56:02] <sirjames079> Just now getting to this stream, has Pat gotten to /the scene/ yet?
[0:56:02] <%WordsHere> You don't have to go the direction of the arrow tomatoBWL
[0:56:03] <Zezuar> from before the door
[0:56:04] <%GarbageNirvana> Other side m8
[0:56:05] <LoneFonte> from the other side
[0:56:05] <snivins> before LUL
[0:56:06] <+ekodrop> direction doesn't matter
[0:56:07] <theanora1> for the other side
[0:56:07] <scarman125> pat I swear to god
[0:56:07] <Saltmeisterr> slide keeps boost
[0:56:07] <zk_nails> Pat...
[0:56:08] <@OfficioPrefectusCorgi> not form that side
[0:56:10] <MartyFun11> You can slide into it from either direction pat
[0:56:10] <%R3Roundabout> psaBlind

[0:56:14] <Explodincatz> pat...
[0:56:14] <%RoboticAnimeDude> from this side pat
[0:56:14] <%JoshManVGH> They aren't unidirectional
[0:56:15] <sleepy_pixels> the arroes direction dooes not matter
[0:56:16] <TheTakkster> @PatStaresAt The arrow isn't indicating the direction you nhave to hit it from
[0:56:16] <Zezuar> slide into the speed block
[0:56:17] <Shwepie> Oh no, he thinks blocks are one way.
[0:56:18] <%ShinobiPhoenix> after the wall jump, SLIDE
[0:56:20] <%Dakuu75> direction doesn't matter
[0:56:21] <TheAzureOracle> If you slide while boosting you keep the boost
[0:56:22] <redwidow1358> You can also spark into slopes and hold toward them, and this restarts the running/rolling.
[0:56:22] <+NickHatesSnow> why are you going to that last room?
[0:56:22] <%VictorVonLouche> arrow direction MEANS NOTHINV
[0:56:23] <%tusk102> @PatStaresAt the arrow direction doesnt matter
[0:56:23] <+Ardailec> They're not one way blocks
[0:56:25] <scarman125> REALLY PAT
[0:56:25] <TioXyco> you lose the speed boost if you turn around
[0:56:26] <+ekodrop> it's just a symbol direction does not matter @PatStaresAt
[0:56:26] <%Beetlewins> go through the first one
[0:56:27] <%JoshManVGH> You can break them from either side
[0:56:27] <%RealThiele> we megaman 8 now bois

[0:56:52] <%TheLemuroid> It's just a symbol
[0:56:53] <%GarbageNirvana> The icon can be confusing
[0:56:53] <Onjani> That's just the speed boost symbol lol
[0:56:54] <Treasure_Vault> Pat hitting the bot every time
[0:56:54] <tanarath> IT'S GOOD
[0:56:54] <redwidow1358> It's just the icon they used because the speed booster icon has always been an arrow
[0:56:55] <$realm_forge> WAKE ME UP
[0:56:56] <%VictorVonLouche> it's just a symbol
[0:56:56] <scarman125> something here is stupid and it's not the game
[0:56:56] <hollumdusk> they aren't
[0:56:57] <tcosmiclatte> the arrrow is just a symbol ike every other power up
[0:56:57] <%Maids4lyfe> IT'S NEVER BEEN ONE WAY THAT WOULD BE STUPID
[0:56:57] <jmuster> you can do it from the right side, also you can do up to 3 of those light speed dashes
[0:56:58] <%ShinobiPhoenix> the blocks are just the Speed Booster Symbol

[0:57:00] <reonome> THEY'RE NOT, THATS WHAT WE'RE TELLING YOU
[0:57:00] <miabyte> that's just the speed boost symbol
[0:57:00] <TioXyco> the ICON is one way, but the blocks doesn't care where you come from
[0:57:01] <+Pachi3000> UH????
[0:57:01] <TheAzureOracle> YOU'VE COMPLETED PART 1

[0:57:21] <Blank9> 90%  there
[0:57:23] <%ShinobiPhoenix> btw- yhou can do this puzzle from the bottom OR TOP
[0:57:25] <+Fep3> parry god
[0:57:26] <+Pachi3000> No that makes it better, why is it dumb lol
[0:57:27] <pixelkenj> the puzzle design dictates it be one way, not the block
[0:57:27] <reonome> pat you are the stupid one lol
[0:57:27] <glass_marcus> OH THIS ONE
[0:57:28] <+EXPsoon> oh nononono , he about to be stuck
[0:57:32] <LoneFonte> this is your life now
[0:57:34] <%ShinobiPhoenix> it's EASIER from the top area
[0:57:35] <snivins> this upgrade is hard
[0:57:35] <tmvct1> YOU ARE STUPID
[0:57:36] <%AncelDeLambert> this one is easier from below
[0:57:38] <+sphiraki> will he beat this one faster than woolie??
[0:57:39] <%tusk102> oh boy
[0:57:40] <%solracc25> ok but now do it for real
[0:57:41] <AoiRob> @PatStaresAt THEYRE NOT ONEWAY
[0:57:41] <ChaoticDaKiller> NOW DO IT GOOD
[0:57:42] <%SaiyanShoto> The speed puzzles in this game are so fun
[0:57:43] <%Dakuu75> lol, he fucking HAD to reveal ALL the blocks
[0:57:44] <%RealThiele> welcome to shine
[0:57:46] <%Piemono> Baited
[0:57:48] <TheHotStuven> This shinespark puzzle has like 3 solutions LUL
[0:57:48] <%ShinobiPhoenix> it's easier from the top
[0:57:53] <doggieo> Woolie did that one the hard way
[0:57:53] <marvel877> How long did it take Woolie?
[0:57:53] <%ShinobiPhoenix> way easier
[0:57:53] <DoctorMulholland> Oh man is Pat seriously gonna figure this out faster than Woolie did?
[0:58:03] <zentzen> thats the simbol of the ability not a direction
[0:58:06] <+sphiraki> @marvel877 a very long time
[0:58:06] <TheHotStuven> Woolie did this the top-route
[0:58:09] <%Raikouija> !uptime
[0:58:09] <@Moobot> @Raikouija I've been playing this game for how long? Oh only 58m 18s.
[0:58:10] <TheHotStuven> which is a lot harder
[0:58:11] <%ShinobiPhoenix> the top just demands you blow up the blocks
[0:58:11] <Zezuar> woolie is admittedly brain dead in a ton of games
[0:58:12] <%WordsHere> I did them all the hard way the first time because I didn't know about this
[0:58:18] <glass_marcus> not just faster, in the way easier way
[0:58:20] <wqorst> ez
[0:58:20] <snivins> Pog
[0:58:20] <%Deft_Thought> CLEAN
[0:58:21] <%solracc25> I found that bottom was easier

[0:58:24] <Saltmeisterr> SICK
[0:58:24] <DoctorMulholland> @marvel877 Like half an hour but he kept trying to come in from ABOVE
[0:58:24] <%twohitgood> @DoctorMulholland woolie has a bad habit of overcomplicating things.
[0:58:25] <TheAzureOracle> Not bad

[0:58:30] <%StoopKid241> Nice
[0:58:30] <+fetrigon> holy shit
[0:58:30] <%ShinobiPhoenix> the bottom demands you to at least one wall jump and a slide and all
[0:58:30] <+JPope3614> what a legend
[0:58:31] <%greasypete00> that's so fun
[0:58:31] <%blankwaffle> poggers
[0:58:31] <%RealThiele> LUL
[0:58:31] <%Beetlewins> nailed it
[0:58:33] <Calek> beat Metroid Vet Woolie by like 10 minutes on this

[0:58:39] <Blank9> woolie did it from the floor above

[0:58:41] <%MashinChaserR> psaDogchamp
[0:58:43] <%HollowedIdjit> SICK
[0:58:43] <%Raikouija> I think I did this another way
[0:58:43] <%solracc25> GG
[0:58:44] <%A_Mighty_Walrus> yeah you should have seen woolie's solution
[0:58:44] <+fetrigon> kensouClap kensouClap kensouClap
[0:58:45] <%AncelDeLambert> I walk away for TWO SECONDS
[0:58:46] <%Raikouija> HOLY SHIT
[0:58:47] <HelluvaNohbody> This took Woolie 30 minutes
[0:58:47] <jorniev> WOOLIE DEFEATED
[0:58:48] <pixelkenj> shinespark puzzles are gonna be weird like this
[0:58:50] <TheHotStuven> top route is very time-contrained
[0:58:50] <%Raikouija> SOMEONE CLIP THAT
[0:58:51] <@GeneralSCPatton> NICE
[0:58:53] <+Pachi3000> Well Woolie did it the hard way
[0:58:55] <Swine_Slime> Nice
[0:58:56] <%ShinobiPhoenix> but WOolie also slapped EMMI early
[0:58:57] <dukenux> didgeridoit
[0:58:57] <%toolofparanoia> YEAH DRINK THAT MONSTER
[0:58:58] <%solracc25> psaUp psaSmug
[0:59:03] <%Saadi90> God Gamer! Very Pog
[0:59:06] <%Raikouija> I did the top clip
[0:59:07] <TheAzureOracle> Woolie tends to overthink these, you probably did it a lot faster than he did
[0:59:08] <%RealThiele> ye it is
[0:59:09] <tmvct1> lol
[0:59:10] <+bloodrune8864> psaDogchamp psaDogchamp psaDogchamp
[0:59:10] <+D00msDayDan> YEEAAAH
[0:59:11] <reonome> unf that angle
[0:59:12] <TwistParabola> and then he falls
[0:59:13] <%Dakuu75> he saw it right?
[0:59:15] <%Raikouija> Top path
[0:59:18] <jorniev> SAMUS IS SOOO COOOL
[0:59:19] <Saltmeisterr> @PatStaresAt theres a sequence break u can do using that tech if ur ballsy enough
[0:59:23] <%Dakuu75> HE SAW IT RIGHT?!
[0:59:24] <jagchan> 69 rockets aaaayyyy
[0:59:26] <TioXyco> @Dakuu75 of course not LUL
[0:59:26] <%ShinobiPhoenix> with the top route all you have to do is blow up the blocks in the way
[0:59:27] <%Deft_Thought> You can punch those robots too
[0:59:27] <%Beetlewins> That was my favorite part of the game tbh
[0:59:28] <%RealThiele> E
[0:59:33] <jorniev> SHE GOES FACE FIRST
[0:59:33] <%Dakuu75> (oh my heart)
[0:59:34] <%Monkeyweed21> @PatStaresAt there's a reason woolie did every Shinespark puzzle he saw
[0:59:35] <azure_dunes> E
[0:59:37] <%tusk102> e
[0:59:38] <redwidow1358> What's really funny is that in Super, the shinespark actually did damage to you. They took that shit right out of every other game though lmfao
[0:59:38] <+fetrigon> @theazureoracle "probably" LUL
[0:59:38] <%solracc25> That one is a cutscene jump
[0:59:39] <miabyte> nice
[0:59:43] <dukenux> lol, that snatch sound
[0:59:52] <%ShinobiPhoenix> with the bottom you have to wall jump, slide and then decide if you want ot charge and run for it or wall jump 4 more times
[1:00:22] <%Raikouija> I finished this game days ago I’m so happy as a metroid fan that this game is designed around sequence breakinng!
[1:00:23] <@GeneralSCPatton> Have you done a ballspark yet?
[1:00:27] <SaltyAzteca> MECHANICS! IN A METROID GAME
[1:00:28] <%RealThiele> many paths
[1:00:28] <tanarath> Is there?
[1:00:32] <+Pachi3000> just go the right way :)
[1:00:34] <%RealThiele> no ballspark yet
[1:00:35] <%JGardner03> Bottom is far easier in my opinion, just go and run lol
[1:00:35] <ChaoticDaKiller> New Ability > Locate Place To Use Ability
[1:00:37] <%zarkazeon> dark blue still bad.
[1:00:37] <%Bailey__Gaming> psaGoblin psaGoblin psaGoblin psaGoblin psaGoblin psaGoblin psaGoblin psaGoblin
[1:00:38] <redwidow1358> Pat has not successfully performed a ballspark
[1:00:42] <tmvct1> that is to hide as invisible ball
[1:00:42] <Louie_Salmon> Balls park
[1:00:44] <Onatamana> I want a metroid racing game where it's just you speed boosting and shinesparking through platforming obstacle courses
[1:00:46] <%Treuan> Life has many doors, Pat boy
[1:00:52] <%tusk102> ball spark when Kappa
[1:00:56] <Shwepie> @redwidow1358 Makes sense that you are powering the Shinespark though.
[1:01:05] <dukenux> did Pat do the ball thing
[1:01:09] <@OfficioPrefectusCorgi> ball spussy
[1:01:09] <Blank9> he did speedball
[1:01:11] <TourettesPlays> The Transformers and Decepticons were fighting over the Ballspark right?
[1:01:11] <%Raikouija> @onatamana fuck that bring back metroid Pinball?!?
[1:01:12] <Onatamana> ball spark sounds like a cbt technique
[1:01:15] <TheAzureOracle> Shine until your balls spark
[1:01:15] <+Pachi3000> the Ball Spark is in the hands of Sam Witwicky
[1:01:15] <Tham1k> Spark ma balls
[1:01:16] <TheHotStuven> Sphere Spark Kappa
[1:01:16] <dukenux> the other ball thing where you have to jump on bombs
[1:01:19] <%greasypete00> isn't that the thing from the Michael Bay transformers
[1:01:20] <Explodincatz> @Onatamana thats just Sonic
[1:01:21] <TioXyco> ball spark is better than ball flash LUL
[1:01:24] <doggieo> Would you prefer ORBspark
[1:01:24] <redwidow1358> Spark deez balls
[1:01:26] <Louie_Salmon> You make my balls spark, gurl
[1:01:27] <lloyddboy> this does not spark ball
[1:01:28] <dukenux> Shinespark me balls
[1:01:29] <%Dakuu75> he JUST got the shinespark like, 2 minutes ago. you impatient goobers
[1:01:30] <hollumdusk> some of those morph ball holes are meant to hide  from the EMMI.
[1:01:36] <%Zeikier> "That's a HORRIBLE name, let's do it"
[1:01:37] <+Pachi3000> he did it
[1:01:38] <+JPope3614> pat just playing around like he on the jungle gym
[1:01:39] <SaltyAzteca> Thats it
[1:01:39] <wqorst> god gamer
[1:01:39] <DoctorMulholland> THAT is a ballspark
[1:01:46] <TioXyco> you got SPINDASH
[1:01:48] <ChaoticDaKiller> ball spark is RARELY used
[1:01:53] <TwistParabola> vrooom
[1:01:55] <tmvct1> You are weird
[1:01:55] <dukenux> "balls spark" sounds like someone vargCBT
[1:01:56] <greatspaceadventure> is it normal to be a little bit scared of Samus?
[1:01:57] <%Raikouija> Ayyy
[1:02:03] <redwidow1358> Helps for really fast movement through tight spaces
[1:02:03] <rommlll> ball spark in water levels are good
[1:02:04] <Maverick2736> Balls successfully sparked
[1:02:04] <%ShinobiPhoenix> it;s even more rarely used by MAX
[1:02:05] <%JoshManVGH> Looks fucking stellar though
[1:02:05] <LoneFonte> check mission log?
[1:02:13] <%Raikouija> You turn into electric SANIC
[1:02:16] <SomeAsianDood> Yes and aroused @greatspaceadventure
[1:02:19] <placeholder03> go to where you havent been
[1:02:21] <%RealThiele> lava is still hot
[1:02:23] <+Pachi3000> BORF
[1:02:24] <%NigelSchnauzerpug> psaDogchamp psaDogchamp psaDogchamp psaDogchamp psaDogchamp psaDogchamp psaDogchamp
[1:02:24] <+fetrigon> @greatspaceadventure be weird if you weren't
[1:02:25] <Make_me_mad> @greatspaceadventure She regularly destroys planets. It'd be weird to not be scared.
[1:02:27] <tanarath> he bork
[1:02:29] <tmvct1> @greatspaceadventure oh boy, do we have some news for you... keep watching!
[1:02:31] <dukenux> scared like being scared of Lady Dimitrescu? Yea
[1:02:32] <%JoshManVGH> He am big talk
[1:02:37] <%Beetlewins> Samus is at this point made up of the DNA of like four different species and she walks around in a bipedal tank, yes, she is terrifying
[1:02:39] <%ScreamLord> Zangief is absorbing too much of Pat's hate
[1:02:45] <%MonsterEnvy> MonsterEnvy subscribed at Tier 1. They've subscribed for 26 months! Yo Pat having fun
[1:02:50] <+CherteuseKapibara> ghosts
[1:02:57] <@goose_attack_almanac> oh is this the sequence break spot?
[1:03:00] <%ShinobiPhoenix> what Peach training him to do currently, isn't that why he's barking?
[1:03:04] <Moondoggie25> Nahh, dont be scared of samus, now an evil samus… no way that would happen… twice…
[1:03:05] <%Raikouija> @beetlewins so Master Chief with extra steps Kappa
[1:03:05] <Snowfellow> Samus in this game is like Master Chief/Doomslayer level
[1:03:10] <tmvct1> the wall there
[1:03:11] <SaltyAzteca> POWAH BOMB
[1:03:12] <dukenux> Samus is such a hulking beast of a woman, all she have to do is to stand straight to be imposing
[1:03:12] <@OfficioPrefectusCorgi> Supers
[1:03:12] <chhdez> Pat Stares at The MAP
[1:03:14] <LoneFonte> shhhh
[1:03:15] <%GarbageNirvana> What indeed
[1:03:18] <%Bailey__Gaming> power bombs
[1:03:19] <Tham1k> Space football
[1:03:20] <%Dakuu75> it's a "fuck you" block
[1:03:20] <%Deft_Thought> I dunno, I heard his Mom drops knives and things on the ground for him to play with. I think its the parents.
[1:03:23] <%RealThiele> shutup its nothing
[1:03:24] <Explodincatz> mouth shot
[1:03:25] <%Shady_Squid> I'd yell at someone too if they took my balls away.
[1:03:27] <%ScreamLord> @Beetlewins 4? I know she has human, Chozo, and Metroid DNA. What's the 4th?
[1:03:35] <jmuster> give samus powah bomb in smash
[1:03:39] <mister_z_1994> X
[1:03:43] <%Raikouija> @screamlord no its just 3
[1:03:50] <spinningchurro> @screamlord mine.
[1:03:52] <%Beetlewins> Doesn't she have some X parasite DNA as well?
[1:03:59] <jmuster> btw you can do up to 3 of those A button air dashes in a row
[1:04:04] <%ShinobiPhoenix> people are a little too obsessed with Sequence Breaking now because it's the current "do the cool thing", you shouldn;t worry about it and people shouldn't be telling anyone to do it especially if they are new to all this
[1:04:06] <Blank9> she got phazon'd up a lot
[1:04:09] <tmvct1> to look the emmi
[1:04:11] <Blank9> if that counts
[1:04:11] <%Raikouija> @beetlewins no metroid EATS X
[1:04:16] <tmvct1> lock
[1:04:20] <Shwepie> @Beetlewins No X DNA at all, zero.
[1:04:22] <+fetrigon> @beetlewins samus is a genetic freak ye
[1:04:24] <Asterlinn> oh I fucking hated that secret
[1:04:25] <%Bailey__Gaming> that dash is so cool
[1:04:29] <hollumdusk> no, the metroid vaccine erase any trace of X on her
[1:04:30] <%Beetlewins> ah ok
[1:04:39] <jmuster> it's a broken air dodge, makes traversal so much easier
[1:04:43] <+attoram> Shine Spark fun fact, if you shine spark onto a slope it continues the speed boost so you can set up shinespark again
[1:04:46] <Asterlinn> this secret block is so ass I hate it
[1:04:49] <Shwepie> @ScreamLord You find out the 4th by the end of Dread.
[1:04:51] <%ShinobiPhoenix> it's like playing Pokemon and everyone keeps screaming to do a nuzlocke
[1:04:53] <dukenux> the most fun thing about sequence breaks is getting an unexpected one
[1:04:54] <Calek> Samus has as much X DNA as you do when you eat chicken
[1:04:56] <redwidow1358> Just as an FYI the flashing portion of the map is only where the item is, the entrance may actually be hidden outside that range.
[1:05:09] <%tusk102> @Blank9 i thought phazon was prime
[1:05:10] <jmuster> oh yeah that one i think was a random ceiling block
[1:05:17] <%GarbageNirvana> There's something you'll get later that makes finding those a lot easier
[1:05:17] <greatspaceadventure> @fetrigon lmao, i definitely lean into the arousal angle but for some reason not for Samus, i think i just feel like she's way too cool for me to sexualize
[1:05:24] <%ShinobiPhoenix> Phazon is Prime and Phazon is gone
[1:05:33] <tmvct1> now?
[1:05:34] <+Delenay> shoot missles to find secrets
[1:05:39] <TwistParabola> AHA
[1:05:42] <ChaoticDaKiller> there IS a subtle tell for destroyable blocks
[1:05:43] <Gamers_RiseUp> he's done it
[1:05:51] <jmuster> nie
[1:05:52] <jmuster> nice
[1:05:53] <+Pachi3000> POG
[1:05:54] <TwistParabola> GAMER
[1:05:54] <@GeneralSCPatton> @beetlewins It's my headcanon that the Metroid vaccine made her get a little bit of X DNA since she was full of her own X-ified DNA which might have tried to reintegrate. Would explain how she absorbs new abilities from Core X.
[1:05:55] <SaltyAzteca> Nice job
[1:05:55] <%Treuan> Nice
[1:05:55] <%GarbageNirvana> Nice
[1:05:55] <Gamers_RiseUp> he's so good
[1:05:56] <+zuzuxiv> YEAHHHHH
[1:05:57] <reonome> good job pat
[1:05:57] <%Dakuu75> nice job.

[1:06:10] <chhdez> Energy Pat 4/4
[1:06:13] <%MechArch> psaDogchamp
[1:06:13] <%ShinobiPhoenix> funny, I didn't use the Bomb Jump for that
[1:06:15] <%Beetlewins> PAt is good at the sekrits
[1:06:20] <%ShinobiPhoenix> I just jumped and climbed in
[1:06:23] <+bloodrune8864> psaDogchamp psaDogchamp
[1:06:24] <miabyte> @patstaresat just so you know, shinesparks do enemy damage
[1:06:26] <halfmasks> one shot pat thats what we call him
[1:06:31] <%Dakuu75> @chhdez that's legit how I read it too. lol
[1:06:32] <scarman125> wait till he sees the Burenia shinespark challenge
[1:06:33] <%NigelSchnauzerpug> He's doing his best Pat.
[1:06:34] <tanarath> Zangief Yes
[1:06:38] <+Pachi3000> D:
[1:06:54] <Parapattern> Zangief is Pat's little pogchamp
[1:06:58] <Calek> @GeneralSCPatton been a minute since I played Fusion, but I'm pretty sure X Parasites can absorb data and Samus is just downloading it basically
[1:07:04] <%ScreamLord> Glad Pat figured out how to get to the Control Unit for the Speed Booster EMMI. I had to accidentally sequence break getting the Grapple Hook to get too it
[1:07:10] <+StingRayVA> I'm really enjoying this game
[1:07:13] <SaltyAzteca> @GeneralSCPatton Samus has finally become Metroid, just liek Master Chief is now Halo Kappa
[1:07:23] <%zarkazeon> look for blocks in the diffrent zones
[1:07:27] <%MonsterEnvy> Another speed block below
[1:07:40] <jmuster> master chief became a halo? wow i am i behind in those games
[1:07:41] <%Beetlewins> No asks why Halo can't crawl
[1:07:42] <Gamers_RiseUp> just dropped in, how's Pat liking the game so far?
[1:07:44] <TioXyco> @SaltyAzteca I thought Master Chef had become a real cook now LUL
[1:07:49] <+Pachi3000> nice missiles gone
[1:07:57] <%RealThiele> number go up
[1:08:03] <hollumdusk> he is enjoying the game
[1:08:04] <LoneFonte> @Gamers_RiseUp just got speed booster, he's loving it
[1:08:04] <Onatamana> I just realized that as of this game, Samus has or has had all of the movement tech in Doom Eternal in some form.
[1:08:04] <tmvct1> teleporter
[1:08:17] <%ScreamLord> Samus and Doomguy are Master Chief's parents
[1:08:20] <SaltyAzteca> @TioXyco Oh you Kappa
[1:08:24] <%Beetlewins> I agree that Samus needs a double barrel shotgun
[1:08:33] <%Monkeyweed21> get the banana

[1:09:57] <SaltyAzteca> SHES BLUE
[1:09:57] <Onatamana> Samus should totally have a 'sword beam' or something which is just an ultra short range lightsaber like projectile from her gun.

[1:12:02] <%HollowedIdjit> SHE'S SICK
[1:12:05] <ExpressNode> I own the 2006 Fate blu-ray but thats probably about what I got
[1:12:06] <%Dementedpenguin> She is.
[1:12:11] <Aydarkzero> the babey
[1:12:12] <%toolofparanoia> her boots are fuckin stylin in this game
[1:12:14] <tmvct1> DABABY

[1:12:17] <%Dementedpenguin> When the writers don't mess her up. LUL
[1:12:18] <redwidow1358> You get some really cool upgrades later, I'm excited to see reactions and such
[1:12:18] <SaltyAzteca> THE BABY BabyRage
[1:12:20] <%AncelDeLambert> this Samus looks at Mother Samus and then walks away
[1:12:20] <%peachy996> Dread rerails her back after OTher M
[1:12:21] <ape_hawk> you mean the other M samus
[1:12:22] <GoogleyGareth> the baby
[1:12:27] <%SaiyanShoto> I want Samus to step on me
[1:12:27] <%Monkeyweed21> the laughably sexist Samus
[1:12:29] <%greasypete00> lets go
[1:12:29] <%AncelDeLambert> GRAPPLE
[1:12:29] <%GarbageNirvana> gee I wonder, what this is,
[1:12:32] <%Arweynn> the baby
[1:12:32] <%tusk102> da baby
[1:12:34] <%razielhex> TIME 'FER GRAPPLIN
[1:12:35] <%Monkeyweed21> ANOTHA ONE
[1:12:36] <$realm_forge> Did I see the concept art of a heavy armor version of her suit?
[1:12:37] <SaltyAzteca> Ohhhh they brought this back??
[1:12:38] <+attoram> I did the armor redesign with the white, looks better than the yellow ya know?
[1:12:38] <tmvct1> Chozo balls > Lootboxes
[1:12:38] <DoctorMulholland> Assuming there ever even is a next Smash, not that there needs to be one, I'd like to see them overhaul Samus's moveset to reflect Dread. She's a beast here.
[1:12:39] <scarman125> Other M will never be canon
[1:12:40] <%RealThiele> ORB
[1:12:40] <Aydarkzero> look at all this tech!
[1:12:40] <%HollowedIdjit> GRAPPLE
[1:12:45] <%AncelDeLambert> this game is LOADED with toys
[1:12:46] <%HollowedIdjit> 360 TIME
[1:12:47] <TioXyco> Gapping beam!
[1:12:49] <+attoram> dig not did
[1:12:50] <hollumdusk> yep, the Baby game is still in the official, ingame timeline
[1:12:58] <marvel877> Yay, this finnicky item
[1:12:59] <%AncelDeLambert> I do find it odd that she uses her gun to do this, and not her hand
[1:13:01] <%HollowedIdjit> give Samus a command grab
[1:13:01] <+JustToWatch> Garpple time
[1:13:04] <jbrachob> also enemies
[1:13:05] <chhdez> Spidoman
[1:13:07] <tmvct1> pat cant read
[1:13:10] <%ScreamLord> Game History Facts: Samus Aran is the 2nd female protagonist in the history of video games. the 1st was Miss. Packman which makes Samus the first human female protagonist
[1:13:13] <%AncelDeLambert> especially after the hand shot showing the grapple point at the beginning of the game
[1:13:17] <%ShinobiPhoenix> just because something sucks doesn't mean to keep picking at it, at some point, it's just wasting time, energy, and mental health for something not worth any of it
[1:13:19] <%RealThiele> grapple range is decptively long
[1:13:20] <redwidow1358> Woolie kept forgetting to grapple the blue wall parts in his run
[1:13:21] <Pistofficer> when do we unlock the yellow laser high heels
[1:13:22] <SaltyAzteca> Samus "Smug" Aran
[1:13:24] <%tusk102> @PatStaresAt but pat what about the bottle ship. for the baby. in MOM. Cuz the baby
[1:13:31] <Onatamana> I still say Other M could be good with minimal changes, like making it take place before Metroid 1. It would make sense if Samus lost her shit at the Ridley encounter if it was the first time she saw him since her childhood.
[1:13:34] <%greasypete00> i kinda wish it was just a press to fire thing
[1:13:46] <%extradopeness> its got a real far reach too further than it seems
[1:13:46] <jorniev> OH SO YOU CAN TOTALLY DO THAT
[1:13:51] <%AncelDeLambert> it IS weird that you have to hold it
[1:13:54] <marvel877> yeah, i hate having to hold it
[1:13:55] <%GarbageNirvana> So is this Woolie's favorite item or
[1:13:57] <%JoshManVGH> Right!?
[1:14:04] <%razielhex> woolie finished this game last night and that was a fukken ride
[1:14:04] <%AncelDeLambert> I kinda wish it would either auto open the blue doors, or keep them open
[1:14:06] <%AncelDeLambert> LUL
[1:14:07] <%ShinobiPhoenix> i keep forgetting Pat really didn't play Super ultimately, there's so many things he's surprised by

[1:14:40] <tmvct1> DYLAN, You son of a b*tch
[1:14:40] <%trackles_64> isnt there a metroid 4 orsometihng?
[1:14:45] <Gamers_RiseUp> dairon... but NEW

[1:14:46] <chhdez> More power
[1:14:47] <Explodincatz> grapple was in Prime
[1:14:52] <MittensBroadcast> pat seems in a happy mood must be loving the game
[1:14:53] <greatspaceadventure> do you consider yourself a Metroid newcomer pat? or how would you describe your relationship to the series so far?
[1:14:53] <Dopamien> screw attack was kinda dumb in 3d imo
[1:15:05] <%Beetlewins> Ok, mod that changes the blaster noise to Tim Allen hoowha noise
[1:15:07] <hollumdusk> the screw attack + space jump, will blow your mind, Pat
[1:15:12] <%dekkitout> IS there such as too much cocaine to sell though?
[1:15:16] <%razielhex> hahaha
[1:15:16] <%ShinobiPhoenix> but yeah, Grapple Beam is not just something you fire, it deals light damage

[1:15:47] <tmvct1> Samus unlocked..... NFT!
[1:15:48] <Onatamana> Metroid Zero Mission did it
[1:15:49] <doggieo> SEQUENCE BREAK?
[1:15:49] <%RealThiele> this part doesnt feel the best
[1:15:50] <marvel877> Zero Mission did that literally
[1:15:51] <SaltyAzteca> Zero Mission does this
[1:15:52] <Calek> Zero Mission technically did
[1:15:53] <%peachy996> It tends to do that in the old games
[1:15:57] <%razielhex> sequencebreakin' bitch
[1:15:57] <%AncelDeLambert> sequence break is from the other side
[1:15:58] <jmuster> Yeah zero mission did it super cool
[1:15:59] <%ShinobiPhoenix> but my thing is, you LITERALLY get those way before you get the Power Bomb
[1:15:59] <redwidow1358> Zero Mission had a similar thing
[1:16:00] <%SaiyanShoto> I'm so glad they let you actually keep it
[1:16:03] <%xbb1024> sonic
[1:16:06] <%ShinobiPhoenix> so it's not even a sequence break
[1:16:06] <%A_Mighty_Walrus> yeah you should see zero mission
[1:16:07] <%solracc25> "sequence break"
[1:16:07] <%peachy996> Zero Mission loved to do that
[1:16:09] <TioXyco> @jorniev there's much and more sequence breakers... some you even could say were intended
[1:16:10] <rommlll> metroid pinball
[1:16:13] <greatspaceadventure> that was one thing i didn't like it, because at least in Zero Mission there was some underlying lore relevance kinda

[1:18:44] <%MonsterEnvy> Right side
[1:18:45] <tmvct1> the troll!
[1:18:54] <chhdez> 『Shortcut』
[1:18:59] <%MonsterEnvy> You found a grapple box
[1:19:01] <zentzen> right side
[1:19:02] <%ShinobiPhoenix> easily accessible items that are blatantly in your face before the items itself that the game PURPOSELY WITHHOLDS from you is not sequence breaking
[1:19:02] <loukemia83> I havent figured this one out
[1:19:03] <@OfficioPrefectusCorgi> ball spark
[1:19:07] <tmvct1> the dood block
[1:19:09] <%GarbageNirvana> Oh this thing
[1:19:14] <Shwepie> Pat is now lost, this is okay.
[1:19:16] <%ShinobiPhoenix> in this case, a sequence break would be getting the Power Bombs
[1:19:19] <%GarbageNirvana> I don't think you have what you need for this one yet
[1:19:19] <%Piemono> He doesn't have the skill for it
[1:19:20] <scarman125> naw not ball spark
[1:19:20] <Blank9> this one is fun
[1:19:20] <ChaoticDaKiller> you cannot get this one right now
[1:19:22] <%zarkazeon> need upgrade
[1:19:23] <%Beetlewins> got to rodimus prime it
[1:19:28] <zk_nails> you lack the upgrade to get this one
[1:19:30] <Notterr> you need another upgrade
[1:19:35] <Gamers_RiseUp> are you a bad enough dude to Get The MIssile?
[1:19:37] <%RealThiele> streamer lacks critical information
[1:19:38] <Calek> I thought this was a speed boost puzzle and I wanted to cry
[1:19:39] <TheHotStuven> This one is flat out impossible atm until later
[1:19:41] <%AncelDeLambert> need timeskip
[1:19:45] <Gamers_RiseUp> you actually can get it but it's hard
[1:19:50] <%MonsterEnvy> @patstaresat you found progression it was on the right side of the map
[1:19:52] <%tusk102> need time stop
[1:19:56] <tmvct1> how long until he figures the path forward? 30 mins? I'll grab a coffee
[1:19:59] <%AncelDeLambert> blue means cold
[1:20:00] <chhdez> Impossible until done
[1:20:03] <Shwepie> @PatStaresAt You can get that one, but it's extremely hard.
[1:20:05] <%RealThiele> Blue is bad
[1:20:06] <%AncelDeLambert> oh, blue block
[1:20:09] <+Pachi3000> there was a grapple block
[1:20:15] <scarman125> blind
[1:20:20] <zentzen> top right side
[1:20:21] <%ShinobiPhoenix> there is a SIMILAR version of that puzzle later than people THINK you need the same upgrade for, but you jsut need a wall jump
[1:20:26] <Varanoo> What did I miss?
[1:20:30] <wqorst> ohno

[1:21:08] <%MonsterEnvy> Not block door
[1:21:13] <Gamers_RiseUp> the big one that didn't get marked for some reason?
[1:21:14] <NitronStreams> Its Progressive Rock
[1:21:16] <%ShinobiPhoenix> to be fair, unlocking shortcuts is progression too, when yuou don't you cause huge problems for yourself later
[1:21:25] <zentzen> top one
[1:21:25] <%Monkeyweed21> @PatStaresAt remember when you broke the speed blocks and immediately ran into another roadblock
[1:21:34] <marvel877> ONE GUY
[1:21:35] <%tusk102> @PatStaresAt that blocks an ugrade, the progress one is above the save room
[1:21:37] <%AncelDeLambert> now you can go up
[1:21:40] <jmuster> shortcutto
[1:21:40] <%GarbageNirvana> Shortcut?
[1:21:44] <marvel877> THAT ONE
[1:21:51] <%ShinobiPhoenix> you will need to get that open to move back and forth
[1:21:55] <+Pachi3000> shortcut is the point
[1:21:56] <Calek> oh the markers show up on the mini map that's cute
[1:22:00] <%RealThiele> he...did it
[1:22:08] <Louie_Salmon> Yeah
[1:22:11] <%ToadKing> most areas like that are to take you around one-way paths
[1:22:14] <%ShinobiPhoenix> later on, you will deeply regret NOT doing that

[1:23:50] <%AncelDeLambert> time skip
[1:23:50] <ChaoticDaKiller> I like the stairs in the back that Samus could obviously take, but she does the dumb grapple beam shit instead

[1:24:03] <Treasure_Vault> bomb jump

[1:24:04] <Onatamana> A thriving civilization
[1:24:06] <chhdez> +Warframe
[1:24:07] <AoiRob> flahs shift wall jump
[1:24:08] <%MonsterEnvy> Dash I think
[1:24:12] <SaltyAzteca> bomb jump yea
[1:24:15] <TheAzureOracle> You can grapple into those
[1:24:17] <%ShinobiPhoenix> I mean a wall jump works too
[1:24:19] <%NigelSchnauzerpug> @ChaoticDaKiller She still has to be cool. Girls might be watching.
[1:24:19] <fairore> thats doable
[1:24:19] <rommlll> take the stupid stairs samus
[1:24:20] <Gamers_RiseUp> ol' buzzsaw bill the ASSHOLE
[1:24:20] <%Monkeyweed21> grapple beam and deash
[1:24:21] <SaltyAzteca> get the rhythm!
[1:24:27] <TwistParabola> he can do it, he's a gamer
[1:24:27] <Onjani> faster
[1:24:33] <tmvct1> 1 bom, delay, then constant rythm
[1:24:37] <%Dakuu75> he fucking bounced the blade over his head. that was cool
[1:24:40] <%ShinobiPhoenix> you can grapplei n hte air, in fact you have to learn that
[1:24:43] <+Funky_Honkey> wall jump
[1:24:48] <+attoram> You can either bomb jump or wait until you get a different power
[1:24:50] <%AncelDeLambert> there's apparently a rhythm to bomb jumping, but whatever just get it later
[1:24:50] <%peachy996> Great to finally have the Chozo involved after decades of being up the Galactic federations butt
[1:24:55] <Gamers_RiseUp> pat is smarter than chat
[1:24:56] <+Funky_Honkey> dash, wall jump
[1:24:57] <@GeneralSCPatton> Dash into wall jump
[1:24:57] <rommlll> will the break happen
[1:24:59] <%blankwaffle> you need a jump upgrade my dude
[1:25:01] <Gamers_RiseUp> flash shift seems like it could work
[1:25:02] <ChaoticDaKiller> you CAN get this now, but it's much easier to do with a later ability
[1:25:02] <%Monkeyweed21> wall jump
[1:25:04] <CaptainBright> ignore bomb jump, just wall jump
[1:25:04] <SaltyAzteca> Cant he bomb jump to the top
[1:25:05] <%ShinobiPhoenix> and you can go into a spin from a dash, but it takes dexterity
[1:25:05] <+Grayhammatter> flash, then wall jump
[1:25:05] <spinningchurro> missiles reveal blocks pats
[1:25:06] <AoiRob> just wall jump
[1:25:07] <Aeroallways> buzzsaw is gonna fuck up you bomb jump, I think there's like two different skills you can use to get this one and I don't think you have either
[1:25:11] <%RealThiele> bombs or upgrades
[1:25:14] <%AncelDeLambert> yeah no
[1:25:14] <AoiRob> dash wall jump
[1:25:15] <TheTakkster> This one isn't worth the time
[1:25:24] <@OfficioPrefectusCorgi> need Gav suit
[1:25:25] <pixelkenj> I did it with bomb jumping
[1:25:29] <tmvct1> dash twice
[1:25:35] <TheAzureOracle> Just mash
[1:25:36] <pixelkenj> real gemer skills
[1:25:37] <%razielhex> 2.6 epacks down from spikey ball
[1:25:42] <rommlll> get into ball games
[1:25:43] <wqorst> ??? is his controller lagging
[1:25:43] <+Grayhammatter> need time stop
[1:25:43] <%ShinobiPhoenix> but otherwise, it's not worth the effort, you can wait until yor other jump upgrades
[1:25:43] <stormhawk9891> Too fast
[1:25:43] <%Dakuu75> ...
[1:25:44] <%GarbageNirvana> The timing has to be impeccable but it can be done
[1:25:45] <%tusk102> god
[1:25:45] <%SaiyanShoto> Keep the rhythm up!
[1:25:46] <Pistofficer> !feetcam
[1:25:48] <%RealThiele> feel the rhythm
[1:25:49] <fairore> lol
[1:25:51] <%SaiyanShoto> Light punch!
[1:25:52] <NoKingArthur> @PatStaresAt you had it right with the dash move, that can work
[1:25:53] <$Jaxnos> it's getting better

[1:25:57] <%razielhex> feel the rhyme
[1:25:57] <Onatamana> Don't drop it
[1:25:57] <tmvct1> 1 bomb, delay, then constant
[1:25:58] <+JustToWatch> sajamInfinite sajamInfinite sajamInfinite sajamInfinite
[1:25:58] <%MonsterEnvy> I redash
[1:25:58] <LoneFonte> light punch
[1:25:58] <Onjani> faster
[1:26:00] <%solracc25> you can do it
[1:26:04] <Louie_Salmon> Pat you have to bomb right before the first bomb explodes
[1:26:05] <%RealThiele> 2 bombs early to start
[1:26:05] <AoiRob> the saw is there specifically to fuck up bomb jumps
[1:26:05] <+fetrigon> faster
[1:26:06] <%AncelDeLambert> you want a bomb HALFWAY up that far
[1:26:08] <Blank9> can also jump to start it  higher
[1:26:08] <$Jaxnos> yeah, just like that
[1:26:09] <%Mr_Pylon> I see that Pat is going for the kick the can up the mountain approach
[1:26:11] <SaltyAzteca> quick 1, 2
[1:26:11] <Asuterisuku> Pieces of heart are always worth the time.
[1:26:12] <%ChrisPlaysThing> Do combo
[1:26:14] <%GarbageNirvana> You pop up faster than they blow up
[1:26:14] <+attoram> you can jump too to help with it, that's what I did
[1:26:14] <DoctorMulholland> Anyone seen that clip of David Jaffe acting like a DSP-tier jackass over this game because he couldn't figure out to shoot an obviously shootable ceiling?
[1:26:15] <Blu_C> Welcome to the new mindgoblin stream I guess.
[1:26:17] <Aeroallways> I find it easiest to place a bomb as you begin to fall
[1:26:18] <$Jaxnos> ikitSip
[1:26:21] <Qsmash_> you bomb again as soon as the first one explodes
[1:26:21] <jkfd> jump first, pat
[1:26:22] <@GeneralSCPatton> The timing should have you place the bomb about halfway through your descent
[1:26:23] <TheAzureOracle> There ya go
[1:26:24] <%MonsterEnvy> Just dash across pat
[1:26:24] <%AncelDeLambert> there he's got it
[1:26:25] <%razielhex> ahh damn
[1:26:25] <TheAzureOracle> Almost
[1:26:25] <%nobodybutalex> Jump first
[1:26:26] <%solracc25> 1 1 2 3

[1:26:30] <TwistParabola> he can do it
[1:26:31] <TwistParabola> i believe
[1:26:42] <AoiRob> plz just do the wall jump
[1:26:42] <%Chichen> bomb up
[1:26:43] <%GarbageNirvana> Getting there
[1:26:43] <tmvct1> hes gonna die first lol
[1:26:44] <%tusk102> 3 etanks down
[1:26:44] <teefpal> mmm i love poison
[1:26:44] <Gamers_RiseUp> it's super consistent if you press it right as the previous bomb explodes
[1:26:46] <%Chichen> 4Head
[1:26:47] <%JoshManVGH> Pat, defeat this goblin and come back for it later when it's impossibly easy.
[1:26:48] <livi242> dash into wall jump is much easier
[1:26:49] <powerprotoman> the rhythm is the beat to lower norfair from super metroid
[1:26:50] <Rav3Games> so are you just mashing here or...
[1:26:51] <%cooldude69xx> Is pat jumping normally?
[1:26:52] <%twistedj3ster> I mean, you can certainly do it

[1:37:28] <olaksi> blind? blind
[1:37:31] <ohno778> Ive read that doujin
[1:37:32] <%topendbuzza> why you let them finished you your ass?
[1:37:33] <+D00msDayDan> is it because of the metroid DNA? being part dog wouldn't make me any more susceptible to bullets
[1:37:34] <BigFingerRo> Hey @PatStaresAt I got a question for ya, that has gone unanswered for quite some time: What BARS are you?
[1:37:35] <+LazyAss24Seven> Girls are cold all the time, regardless of Metroid DNA LUL
[1:37:36] <%greasypete00> he opened a gate far away from here
[1:37:38] <Gamers_RiseUp> you should let robot friend extract that metroid DNA from your ass so that you can experience the Montreal winter rooms
[1:37:38] <marvel877> BLIND
[1:37:40] <+Grayhammatter> blind
[1:37:41] <+Pachi3000> nah. they off
[1:37:44] <%MonsterEnvy> Why did you not go down?
[1:37:45] <%ShinobiPhoenix> I don't like the unexplained reason why Varia Suit suddenlty doesn't protect against Cold
[1:37:52] <%RealThiele> just push the EMMI into lava ez
[1:37:57] <%cooldude69xx> So there were just Chozo hanging out and no one noticed?
[1:37:59] <Lightger_Zero> NotLikeThis NotLikeThis NotLikeThis NotLikeThis NotLikeThis
[1:37:59] <olaksi> samus hit menopause early, can't handle cold anymore
[1:38:01] <AoiRob> no girls allowed
[1:38:01] <ChaoticDaKiller> imagine if you can just wail on that emmi now and get the ability way early
[1:38:06] <AoiRob> only emmi
[1:38:08] <%ShinobiPhoenix> even in Fusion, that was the point of the Varia suit
[1:38:09] <+Pachi3000> @shinobiphoenix Metroid DNA. it's more powerful
[1:38:11] <teefpal> I'd love to see the manga birbs show up in future metroid games
[1:38:14] <zentzen> the continuing adventures of blind pat
[1:38:17] <%baronouroboros> Samus has to be utterly furious now, to be honest
[1:38:19] <marvel877> Wrong way, Pat.
[1:38:27] <%RealThiele> LUL
[1:38:30] <Asuterisuku> I think you CAN spark that, but you can't get out that way.
[1:38:41] <%ShinobiPhoenix> @Pachi3000 again, even in Fusion... the game she gets Metroid DNA, the Varia Suit protects her from cold
[1:38:52] <TheAzureOracle> Hehehe
[1:38:52] <Asuterisuku> This spark puzzle though.

[1:39:18] <Saltmeisterr> @PatStaresAt ball spark is gonna be important for this one
[1:39:21] <Asuterisuku> Right idea.
[1:39:25] <+Pachi3000> @shinobiphoenix It's implied her Metroid DNA gets more potent the longer she has it
[1:39:32] <Blank9> it teaches you a lot

[1:40:49] <bananasMAXIMUM> GOOD ALIEN OPENED A PATH FOR YOU
[1:40:49] <Asuterisuku> It's actually easier to do that one later when you no longer get hurt by the cold.
[1:40:50] <halfmasks> BIG G PAT
[1:40:51] <+D00msDayDan> i did that one by going through the cold room for the run-up, losing health with each attempt
[1:40:51] <+Pachi3000> reading your chili
[1:40:52] <teefpal> Can't believe I've never tried diagonal
[1:40:52] <%RealThiele> DARION
[1:40:55] <$realm_forge> I like the aesthetic of this area
[1:40:55] <@Ranryu692> Dairon, Dairon, Dairon, Dairon, Dairon.... because he spits hot fire

[1:41:01] <%rumtumtugnutz> rumtumtugnutz subscribed at Tier 2. They've subscribed for 37 months! You burned your tongue reading?
[1:41:01] <marvel877> READING CHILI
[1:41:02] <%ShinobiPhoenix> it's like the video game logic of GUNS getting stronger because you leveled up
[1:41:03] <%SaiyanShoto> I'm still waiting for the chili to hit him and he poops himself
[1:41:08] <@TheYellowcouch> this game looks so good
[1:41:13] <ChaoticDaKiller> so many people do that one by blowing up the block and dropping into a shinespark instead of doing the diagonal ballspark
[1:41:13] <%Beetlewins> Remember what the alien birb showed you
[1:41:13] <tanarath> Pat, was your chili spicy?

[1:44:14] <+ThomasOfTroy> 3. You're over-reading into the discrepancy
[1:44:15] <Tham1k> Well it's not like adam ends all his sentences in lady
[1:44:15] <halfmasks> PROTOTYPE SAMUS
[1:44:15] <%ShinobiPhoenix> speaking as someone who has to make such people had the RIGHT gas mask for combat situations, you would just give them the better mask by default
[1:44:16] <+DeepPix3l> Playing a Amus Saran
[1:44:16] <tmvct1> MEDIC!
[1:44:16] <Asuterisuku> To Burenia!

[1:44:20] <Gamers_RiseUp> there's an impostroid amogus
[1:44:20] <+McDerpus> but I thought that was Metroid!
[1:44:21] <%ScreamLord> I'm gonna go with the boringer potion
[1:44:22] <teefpal> Venon Samus
[1:44:23] <Qsmash_> It's John Metroid. US Space Marine.
[1:44:23] <Swine_Slime> Pat is fucking stoned
[1:44:24] <AoiRob> duuude what if you were SA-X the whole time
[1:44:25] <%Chichen> Pat you have to wait for the crystal exarch to remove his hood
[1:44:25] <Shardlab> This did not occur to me to question her identity
[1:44:25] <Treasure_Vault> Is this Muxsas
[1:44:27] <%tusk102> sa-x exists
[1:44:28] <halfmasks> ALEX MERCER SAMUS
[1:44:29] <@GeneralSCPatton> "Oh, am I mistaken? I thought I heard something about delicious pancakes..."
[1:44:29] <%greasypete00> its not adam its patrick
[1:44:31] <%Teyaric> a sa-x?????
[1:44:32] <Rav3Games> Samus Pliskin
[1:44:33] <stanlychicken> It's metroid dread, who's samus?
[1:44:33] <+megaman_sentinel> big medic
[1:44:33] <%A_Mighty_Walrus> adam the sussy baka
[1:44:34] <marvel877> PUNISHED SAMUS
[1:44:34] <%Bane_Kaikyo> I still haven't beat the game, I really hope I don't see Chat say a spoiler
[1:44:35] <TioXyco> you are in daironrhea
[1:44:41] <TheHotStuven> Alllthe way left
[1:44:43] <%solracc25> or 3 you are not Pat
[1:44:43] <Tham1k> Jane metroid
[1:44:43] <+V_bob> Ah, so you're playing one of the medics from metroid fusion
[1:44:46] <%IamGrapes> what if the metriod, parasite, and Samus DNA got all mixed together
[1:44:51] <%Monkeyweed21> lol
[1:44:51] <%Beetlewins> Or like, it could just be he doesn't call her Lady exclusively
[1:44:51] <%razielhex> Pat, you must consult with the Elder Gods
[1:44:51] <%zarkazeon> blue bad
[1:44:51] <LoliKappa> maybe it's just a prank caller doing a robot voice
[1:44:54] <TioXyco> @Bane_Kaikyo SPOILER! DOWNFORCE!
[1:44:59] <%Saadi90> We are all Samus
[1:45:00] <+fetrigon> @bane_kaikyo go beat the game
[1:45:02] <marvel877> Pat, blue means cold.
[1:45:02] <%peachy996> Oh like that episode of Voyager
[1:45:02] <Tigerols> Punished "Venom" Samus
[1:45:06] <%ShinobiPhoenix> but the SAME mask doesn't lose its ability to protect against the SAME threat just because your physical body changed unless you just can't physically wear the mask
[1:45:07] <Explodincatz> Pats thinking about the writing more than Nintendo ever will
[1:45:09] <hat_under_bread> You're playing as Metroid. That's what the series is called.
[1:45:09] <wqorst> roboracist
[1:45:10] <+Pachi3000> :)
[1:45:10] <%watts121> Punished Samus?
[1:45:10] <TheHotStuven> Samus cant be an X if she has metroid dna tho
[1:45:11] <+GalacticaPhanto> What if it's a clone of Ripley? ever thought of that?
[1:45:11] <Saltmeisterr> @PatStaresAt theres a cool sequence break u can do in the ice zone
[1:45:13] <%peachy996> Where they were the goo
[1:45:16] <teefpal> @Bane_Kaikyo I reccomend you finish the game
[1:45:16] <%RealThiele> ok
[1:45:17] <%IamGrapes> @V_bob is that what i think thats referencing? lol
[1:45:17] <+DeepPix3l> Liquid Samus
[1:45:18] <Zeppelee> Samus is an amalgam at this point.
[1:45:20] <tmvct1> It's the medic from BSL Station
[1:45:24] <olaksi> what if they do a reverse 3rd birthday, and the real samus is still real whiny
[1:45:25] <Treasure_Vault> What if you're the robot and the ai is samus
[1:45:31] <fairore> @IamGrapes metroid dna would just eat it
[1:45:34] <teefpal> before watching streams or stuff of Dread
[1:45:35] <Asuterisuku> Apparently not.
[1:45:36] <%Monkeyweed21> nope
[1:45:36] <redwidow1358> Liquid Samus. Jam her up your peehole.
[1:45:37] <Saltmeisterr> @PatStaresAt u can sequence break here
[1:45:37] <%peachy996> Hey Pat do you remember that episode of Voyager where the Goo Clones of the Crew horribly died?
[1:45:38] <T_Sasquatch> doesnt dark samus already exist
[1:45:39] <%captain_thickthighs> Pat the level has been telling you a story the whole time
[1:45:41] <%ShinobiPhoenix> @Zeppelee She's been an amalgam since before Metroid 1
[1:45:43] <sirjames079> I want a Venom Samus game where the twist is that you're playing as a further evolved Dark Samus who is now near identical to a human
[1:45:43] <%tusk102> @ShinobiPhoenix the metroid effected her suit too, its partially organic now
[1:45:44] <+megaman_sentinel> how did u miss this
[1:45:46] <Shwepie> Power is off when you first reach this room.
[1:45:48] <SaltyAzteca> oh.
[1:45:48] <+Chrono_Knight> The power was off when you came through here before
[1:45:50] <+fetrigon> @bane_kaikyo is gud game. finish it. then come back
[1:45:51] <%ShinobiPhoenix> she's just more than 2 things now
[1:45:53] <%TheLemuroid> They did "Venom" Samus like twice already: S-AX and Dark Samus
[1:45:54] <andresisant> 69 nice
[1:45:57] <%Bane_Kaikyo> @fetrigon Fuck you I need to take breaks so I don't burn out. Also I'm coming down off of a panic attack so it's NOT the best time to play DREAD
[1:46:07] <AoiRob> it was turned off
[1:46:07] <Saltmeisterr> @PatStaresAt u can sequence break there pat
[1:46:16] <Asuterisuku> The melee counters are so good.
[1:46:17] <+megaman_sentinel> ok
[1:46:20] <+GalacticaPhanto> @bane_kaikyo boy I can relate to that
[1:46:27] <%Bane_Kaikyo> @fetrigon Can't right now, just had panic attack, not good idea
[1:46:29] <hollumdusk> this game even over complicates her Bird side, later on. This girl is a mess
[1:46:32] <%solracc25> psaBig cold
[1:46:34] <olaksi> it's more like evil quadruplets at this point
[1:46:43] <Qsmash_> @TheLemuroid wrong Venom. The MGS Venom.
[1:46:47] <tmvct1> poor guy, hope nothing bad happens to him............
[1:46:49] <AoiRob> ew
[1:46:51] <%ShinobiPhoenix> people:  the suit was ALWAYS biomechanical
[1:46:52] <%tusk102> @hollumdusk ssshhhhhh
[1:46:53] <%RealThiele> also each map gets 6 markers but just 6 in total
[1:46:53] <Zeppelee> @shinobiphoenix Yep, she has. She now has three different DNA strands in her body.
[1:47:02] <teefpal> Maximize window/close chatbox
[1:47:02] <%SaphronBlackbourne> Heat and cold damage increases exponentially in this game so heat/cold runs are very limited
[1:47:03] <TheHotStuven> PAT LUL
[1:47:05] <%RealThiele> so 6 here 6 in artoria etc
[1:47:09] <Asuterisuku> You didn't need to come in here LUL
[1:47:10] <+Grayhammatter> LUL
[1:47:11] <+fetrigon> @bane_kaikyo sorry about that bud. Enjoy the stream.
[1:47:15] <olaksi> @Zeppelee kinky
[1:47:15] <+megaman_sentinel> same
[1:47:21] <Zezuar> gay
[1:47:23] <%Teyaric> the suit is a magical girl transform - it's hardlight
[1:47:25] <+Pachi3000> hot
[1:47:25] <+DeepPix3l> IN his mouth?
[1:47:26] <Tham1k> Do it
[1:47:26] <%MegadBlitz> gief hours
[1:47:27] <%ShinobiPhoenix> it just became more bioorganic when they removed the mechanical parts
[1:47:27] <DrillStopsNoCops> dawwwwww
[1:47:28] <%TheLemuroid> @Qsmash_ Oh, that makes more sense
[1:47:28] <+ThomasOfTroy> He sucked a dick with that mouth
[1:47:29] <%tusk102> @Zeppelee whats the third
[1:47:29] <Zezuar> not that thats bad tho
[1:47:30] <+GalacticaPhanto> @zeppelee dont you know? she's half Xehanort too
[1:47:30] <+NickHatesSnow> yeah
[1:47:31] <%GarbageNirvana> Normal reaction to dog
[1:47:32] <%Bane_Kaikyo> @fetrigon thanks, dats da plann
[1:47:34] <%JoshManVGH> Snoozy puppers
[1:47:34] <%captainpodock> Do it
[1:47:35] <Zeppelee> GIEF
[1:47:36] <+Grayhammatter> the baby
[1:47:38] <%Deft_Thought> Gib BURGER
[1:47:38] <hollumdusk> though, funy you mention Marvel Venom. A Fusion remake after Dread would look very interesting
[1:47:39] <TheHotStuven> Give him the sloppy stuff
[1:47:42] <%PhantomMiG> @patstaresat the amount of sequence break just at this moment is already high. There is already 2 phase 1 quick kills
[1:47:43] <godzookylives> HOT
[1:47:43] <%ShinobiPhoenix> do people think Samus just goes around picks up the parts of her suit that break off
[1:47:46] <@GeneralSCPatton> I spent the whole game hoping we were actually playing a version of SA-X, and that that's why the EMMI were after her.
[1:47:47] <LoneFonte> guys, please chill with the spoilers
[1:47:50] <Azathotic> I feel like the hardlight suit thing got retconned in later
[1:47:59] <Zeppelee> @tusk102 Human, Chozo, and Metroid.
[1:48:01] <%captainpodock> GIEf Slumbers
[1:48:02] <+Grayhammatter> is it though?
[1:48:06] <Saltmeisterr> theres a secret there tho
[1:48:06] <teefpal> I'd love a Fusion remake
[1:48:11] <+superchronicc> excape the SOMA
[1:48:13] <%RealThiele> is itttt?
[1:48:28] <Zeppelee> I want a Super remake.
[1:48:32] <wqorst> weird
[1:48:33] <%Chichen> yah
[1:48:34] <+Grayhammatter> it is quite good
[1:48:35] <%tusk102> it do be good
[1:48:35] <%Piemono> obvious secret missed
[1:48:36] <%greasypete00> it is
[1:48:38] <SaltyAzteca> Yes you should play Fusion
[1:48:39] <%SaiyanShoto> I heard this dev wanted to do a fusion remake and I can definitely see that with this game
[1:48:40] <OldManDeckardCain> woolie said it's the best one yet LUL
[1:48:41] <%RealThiele> im ok without a super remake honestly
[1:48:43] <marvel877> It is
[1:48:50] <%ShinobiPhoenix> @teefpal yea and MercurySteam has been trying to make one, but Nintendo pushed them to this instead
[1:48:51] <@GeneralSCPatton> An accurate assessment
[1:48:54] <+NickHatesSnow> Super metroid is the only one that needs a remake
[1:48:55] <Buttku> is it worth $60 tho
[1:48:55] <fairore> @GeneralSCPatton you played fusion right?
[1:48:56] <%Piemono> look at the room you said was purely for escape
[1:48:56] <%Teyaric> that's why she was fucky in fusion - they couldn't get the suit off since it doesn't come off. she transforms into it like a Kamen rider
[1:48:57] <teefpal> he
[1:48:58] <AoiRob> yes it might be qualified as OK
[1:48:59] <%tusk102> mind goblins defeated
[1:49:03] <%GarbageNirvana> Imagine if they did a Super Metroid remake like this
[1:49:05] <TheHotStuven> LUL
[1:49:06] <@Ranryu692> Super desperately needs a remake
[1:49:11] <%ShinobiPhoenix> Dread is actually attempt #2 at getting Nintendo to let them remake Fusion
[1:49:11] <TheHotStuven> They are NOT defeated
[1:49:12] <Treasure_Vault> Do you prefer 2d castlevanias or metroids?
[1:49:17] <Asuterisuku> Woolie didn't actually need much help to beat the game; I recall a grand total of one time where he actually had to ask the chat.
[1:49:20] <%Deft_Thought> I dunno, I don't like how confident Samus is. I prefer a heroine in need of protection, like in the classic Metroid: Other M game!
[1:49:22] <%topendbuzza> this game may be the be the shit
[1:49:24] <teefpal> Super needs a "remaster"
[1:49:30] <%ShinobiPhoenix> Attempt #1 was Samus Returns
[1:49:31] <+GalacticaPhanto> @teyaric Isnt that what her final smash in Brawl was referencing to?
[1:49:32] <marvel877> Yeah, that map blinks white when  there's something there in an area you've been to.
[1:49:32] <+NickHatesSnow> metroid is more fun than castlevania tbh
[1:49:36] <@GeneralSCPatton> @GeneralSCPatton Of course
[1:49:38] <Asuterisuku> Super is FINE.
[1:49:39] <Calek> Super's item management is nutty considering that problem was solved in fusion and zero mission
[1:49:43] <+Grayhammatter> super needs a remake, i agree
[1:49:45] <%ShinobiPhoenix> which is WHY the Fusion stuff is in it
[1:49:46] <%SirGO0SE> @Deft_Thought LUL
[1:49:53] <TioXyco> @Ranryu692 and that's why nintendo will never do it LUL
[1:49:55] <%ShinobiPhoenix> they were expecting to get to finally make hte Fusion remake
[1:49:56] <olaksi> @Deft_Thought "refreshing vulnerability"  Kreygasm
[1:49:57] <+FoolsArcade> tap B then direction
[1:50:02] <+Delenay> it was to the right of the long run in another room
[1:50:02] <%Bane_Kaikyo> Wasn't Super Metroid 2? Wasn't Samus Returns a remake of that?
[1:50:05] <+superchronicc> man I love the shine spark so much
[1:50:08] <TheHotStuven> ball sparl
[1:50:12] <%GarbageNirvana> Or you could hit that tunnel dead center
[1:50:12] <ChaoticDaKiller> check da map, Goof
[1:50:12] <+NickHatesSnow> @Calek super predates them tho
[1:50:15] <%Monkeyweed21> @PatStaresAt ballspark up the shaft
[1:50:17] <DoctorMulholland> Super is Metroid 3
[1:50:17] <+Funky_Honkey> if you nail the shinespark you don't have to
[1:50:17] <teefpal> Yea its annoying
[1:50:18] <@Ranryu692> @Ranryu692 I hate that you're right
[1:50:19] <+Chrono_Knight> Super Metroid is Metroid 3
[1:50:22] <%Ne1son> Ballspark it
[1:50:24] <marvel877> Bomb jump a whole bunch.
[1:50:24] <Shwepie> You can make it up that hole.
[1:50:25] <JTEIO> Super is 3
[1:50:27] <Saltmeisterr> oh yeah u can ballspark it
[1:50:27] <%A_Mighty_Walrus> @Bane_Kaikyo no metroid 2 was on the gameboy
[1:50:27] <+Grayhammatter> yes, unless you do a shine spark up the shaft
[1:50:28] <SaltyAzteca> You...might make it?
[1:50:30] <Shwepie> I believe in you.
[1:50:30] <%Deft_Thought> @Deft_Thought I see you're a person of taste as well psaBougie
[1:50:30] <jmuster> well the emmi valve is open technically
[1:50:31] <%captain_thickthighs> ballspark
[1:50:36] <Zeppelee> However, if Mercury were to skip Super and remake Fusion instead, then I would be satisfied.
[1:50:40] <blue_fates> super Metroid is Metroid 3 fusion is 4
[1:50:44] <+Delenay> reload?
[1:50:46] <%Teyaric> I don't recall what was her final smash?
[1:50:46] <Calek> @NickHatesSnow yeah i meant going back to it is nutty
[1:50:46] <hollumdusk> I only want Super remake now, for the bosses. The Pirates High Comand on Dread's style, would be sick
[1:50:47] <%zarkazeon> go back to save?
[1:50:49] <+Chrono_Knight> Samus Returns was a remake of Return of Samus
[1:50:52] <%ShinobiPhoenix> though chronically, SUper is actually more like Metroid 6
[1:50:54] <+GalacticaPhanto> @patstaresat you can totally make it up there with a shinespark
[1:50:55] <TheHotStuven> on the right side of the wire
[1:50:55] <%solracc25> ball jump
[1:50:57] <%captain_thickthighs> ball spark
[1:51:00] <%tusk102> @PatStaresAt you have to be in ball form btw
[1:51:05] <%ShinobiPhoenix> because Metroid 1, 3 Primes and 2
[1:51:09] <fairore> god that suit is so ugly in fusion
[1:51:10] <hollumdusk> even Kraid was bound on this game, so it wasn't a full fight.
[1:51:11] <Asuterisuku> @ShinobiPhoenix 7 if you count Hunters.
[1:51:16] <%tusk102> oop
[1:51:18] <%twistedj3ster> did Pat unlock Samus' Beak yet?
[1:51:18] <%zarkazeon> niiiiice
[1:51:19] <SaltyAzteca> Nice job
[1:51:20] <%ShinobiPhoenix> yes, 7
[1:51:20] <%Bane_Kaikyo> Which one was Returns a remake of?
[1:51:21] <%tusk102> nevermind
[1:51:27] <+NickHatesSnow> @Calek oh totally, I hate the physics in super so much
[1:51:28] <+DeepPix3l> psaUp
[1:51:28] <+youngjwilliams> super metroid needs a control tweak, maybe remake assets, but otherwise that game is fine as is
[1:51:29] <+D00msDayDan> @tusk102 lol
[1:51:29] <%ShinobiPhoenix> 2
[1:51:31] <@Ranryu692> but do said skills pay the bills?
[1:51:32] <fnjohnboy> Slick
[1:51:33] <%RealThiele> Game,
[1:51:35] <marvel877> 3
[1:51:36] <Asuterisuku> @Bane_Kaikyo 2, Return of Samus
[1:51:37] <marvel877> 2
[1:51:38] <hollumdusk> Returns was a remake of 2
[1:51:40] <%tusk102> @Bane_Kaikyo samus returns is a remake of 2 i think
[1:51:40] <LoneFonte> Returns is 2
[1:51:40] <%SaiyanShoto> Returns is a remake of 2
[1:51:45] <marvel877> 2, damn my keyboard
[1:51:46] <SaltyAzteca> LUL
[1:52:00] <Treasure_Vault> That is irrespective to your skills
[1:52:02] <%Mr_Pylon> we don't pay you for skill
[1:52:04] <%SaiyanShoto> Your lack of skills pays the bills
[1:52:06] <%SirGO0SE> skills laid, bills paid B)
[1:52:09] <%ShinobiPhoenix> that's why it;s called Samus Returns, after Metroid 2 Return of Samus
[1:52:09] <Treasure_Vault> You might have more subs if your skills were worse, tbh
[1:52:12] <Asuterisuku> It's so GREAT to have 5 after all of these years.
[1:52:15] <marvel877> I thought Elmo and Gief paid the bills?
[1:52:15] <%topendbuzza> no one is here for the skill Kappa
[1:52:16] <%Mr_Pylon> we pay you for a fun time =)
[1:52:19] <miabyte> pat did you never play the fan game am2r? it's almost as good as this
[1:52:20] <%SirGO0SE> hes not wrong
[1:52:23] <%retrohazard> I'm only here for the hot takes
[1:52:24] <@Ranryu692> LUL
[1:52:25] <+Grayhammatter> OH
[1:52:25] <%tusk102> like dsp
[1:52:28] <SaltyAzteca> THAT BURN WASNT NECESSARY
[1:52:28] <%greasypete00> LUL
[1:52:28] <+youngjwilliams> I will say, i do miss loading screen samus thoughts
[1:52:30] <halfmasks> The possibility of you shitting your pants on stream are what pay the bills
[1:52:30] <%SaiyanShoto> Burned her worse than the chili
[1:52:30] <bananasMAXIMUM> BURN-nia
[1:52:31] <Treasure_Vault> OH
[1:52:32] <+DeepPix3l> damn
[1:52:33] <+D00msDayDan> DAMN
[1:52:33] <Saltmeisterr> GOT DAMN
[1:52:38] <Zeppelee> I remember that, in MP1, you could unlock the Fusion suit/Hard mode if you had Fusion with your GBA hooked up.
[1:52:38] <Manwad> annihilated
[1:52:40] <%walternatorz> all I can say is that Paige gets my real sub and you get my twitch sub.
[1:52:42] <+tempestzephyr> the burns
[1:52:43] <sirjames079> We're gonna go tell on you!
[1:52:43] <%ShinobiPhoenix> and the ring hits his skull
[1:52:55] <%Stan4Apples> bLOODY HELL
[1:52:57] <Martian571> Burenia is just Kamino, change my mind.
[1:53:01] <%tusk102> @PatStaresAt people only watch to see if you shit your pants Kappa
[1:53:01] <%MugenSandan> Why would you just delete her like that
[1:53:03] <DoctorMulholland> Try grappling the ceiling guy when he's blue
[1:53:05] <Asuterisuku> Those guys can be grappled off the ceiling.
[1:53:07] <%blastyoboots> grapple block was below in prev rum
[1:53:20] <indig0bird> I can't wait for the speedruns
[1:53:21] <%ForlornCarton> You can grapple that enemy when the blue light is showing

[1:54:50] <wqorst> it's ez
[1:54:50] <%greasypete00> gamer
[1:54:52] <BoneofMalkav> LUL
[1:54:56] <%ShinobiPhoenix> wow, Pat, so hard
[1:54:56] <%SirGO0SE> the birthday suit is my favorite :)
[1:54:57] <Asuterisuku> These games like to troll.
[1:55:00] <+Grayhammatter> missile+ tank, that's what it is
[1:55:08] <%RealThiele> dick blocks
[1:55:09] <+Evendrag> alot less troll shit compared to other metroid games tbh
[1:55:29] <bobdoletrasher> @PatStaresAt yank the enemies with a blue glow
[1:55:37] <olaksi> stop dying genius
[1:55:40] <%TheLemuroid> Do those laser barnacles have grapple points?
[1:55:40] <%RealThiele> kojumbo
[1:55:41] <DoctorMulholland> Protip, the blue grapple glow applies to enemies as well. Make of that what you will Pat.
[1:55:43] <jmuster> blue is the color of grapple
[1:55:48] <+Grayhammatter> pat bout to die
[1:55:58] <Asuterisuku> Bladder exploding.
[1:56:00] <SaltyAzteca> Fist pump = piss imminent
[1:56:01] <Visorak6> theme of piss explosion
[1:56:03] <TheAzureOracle> Fist pump so hard you piss yourself live on stream
[1:56:04] <%cooldude69xx> Dammit, we almost had him
[1:56:05] <%RealThiele> chili shit time
[1:56:06] <Saltmeisterr> a piss pump you could say
[1:56:15] <%Alzero83> cant hold your pee for a couple hours, you might wanna get that checked
[1:56:15] <%captain_thickthighs> dude has a 0-100 piss
[1:56:18] <+GalacticaPhanto> This game is fucking hype, he's catching up to where I left off
[1:56:20] <$realm_forge> Squeeze that orb
[1:56:33] <%TheLemuroid> Well now we know how he will shit himself in the future
[1:57:17] <+youngjwilliams> I really hope were not waiting long for more metroid, 2d and prime
[1:57:50] <+kingmemelord97> !uptime
[1:57:50] <@Moobot> @kingmemelord97 I've been playing this game for how long? Oh only 1h 57m.
[1:57:58] <Azathotic> Chat, what was the last upgrade he got? Wanna know how far he is to me
[1:58:05] <Saltmeisterr> oh hey new Strive patch
[1:58:14] <%ShinobiPhoenix> I think 5 yaers for new Metroid is fine, take time for it
[1:58:17] <%TheLemuroid> Grapple, I think
[1:58:18] <+youngjwilliams> grapple
[1:58:18] <%twistedj3ster> I can't wait until Pat gets to the whale enemy area
[1:58:19] <Asuterisuku> Grapple Beam?
[1:58:21] <fairore> @youngjwilliams i think the 2d games are gonna be fine
[1:58:24] <%ShinobiPhoenix> 20 maybe a bit much
[1:58:25] <Saltmeisterr> looks like a beeg one
[1:58:27] <+Grayhammatter> grapple it seems
[1:58:27] <%twistedj3ster> whussy will rise again
[1:58:38] <%NigelSchnauzerpug> Is Pat shitting his pants live on stream again?
[1:58:53] <Asuterisuku> Steam isn't showing a Strive patch.
[1:58:54] <%Puhff> I work at home during Pat's show now and I hate how our breaks seem to line up :(
[1:58:59] <fairore> @ShinobiPhoenix 5years is a lot
[1:59:00] <+LazyAss24Seven> There was chili involved…
[1:59:06] <%twistedj3ster> @NigelSchnauzerpug he never really stops
[1:59:21] <+GalacticaPhanto> MercurySteam really redeemed themselves with this game because holy shit their other games are awful
[1:59:28] <Azathotic> @twistedj3ster That's my secret Captain....
[1:59:31] <%ShinobiPhoenix> @ShinobiPhoenix not for game development, that's normal
[1:59:31] <+GalacticaPhanto> except maybe LoS1. on a good day
[1:59:38] <Azathotic> I'm always shitting myself
[1:59:41] <@TheYellowcouch> First he burns his mouth, then he burns his hole
[1:59:51] <%ShinobiPhoenix> normal if you want it to be good
[1:59:56] <%NigelSchnauzerpug> THe Wrath of the CHili.
[1:59:56] <+youngjwilliams> anything else besides the vania on their record?
[2:00:09] <$realm_forge> I remember the last time pat had chili before a stream he had to cut to brb 3 times in 45 min
[2:00:20] <Asuterisuku> @GalacticaPhanto LoS2 makes a bad first impression but makes up for it later.
[2:00:52] <fairore> @GalacticaPhanto tbh i didnt think mirror of fate was bad
[2:00:58] <+GalacticaPhanto> @asuterisuku Does it? those stealth sequences made the first Vania I legit stopped playing
[2:01:06] <%ShinobiPhoenix> Mirror of Fate was mid, it was fine
[2:01:09] <%Teyaric> @asuterisuku you lie. the giant red soldier stealth sections
[2:01:15] <%ShinobiPhoenix> Lords of Shadow 1 and 2 are horrid
[2:01:23] <%Theycallmenerf> Did I miss it all?
[2:01:24] <Asuterisuku> There are literally no more stealth sequences after that first one.
[2:01:28] <%NigelSchnauzerpug> Am I wrong for thinking chili isn't really a meal, but rather something that goes with or on something else?
[2:01:43] <ChaoticDaKiller> You know this game is great because it's cool when Samus talks this time
[2:01:47] <%Teyaric> huh. I quit at that one. hmmm.
[2:01:50] <%ShinobiPhoenix> Mirror of Fate is legit the best of the Lords of Shadow games but that's not saying much plotwise, but ultimately the plot was Konami, not Mercury Steam
[2:01:51] <%notsoy> it can be something eaten by itself
[2:01:52] <+youngjwilliams> why not both?
[2:02:00] <%ospreyworks> ospreyworks subscribed at Tier 1. They've subscribed for 22 months! Greetings, Goblin Slayer Patron! Were you ever into dressing up for Halloween, and if so, what was your best costume? How do you like to celebrate the occasion now?
[2:02:06] <$realm_forge> @nigelschnauzerpug it definitely makes certain foods better
[2:02:11] <%NigelSchnauzerpug> Maybe I just never had good chili.
[2:02:18] <+GalacticaPhanto> @shinobiphoenix True the Trevor/Simon stuff was alright
[2:02:26] <+youngjwilliams> chili is great man
[2:02:28] <%ShinobiPhoenix> but Lords of Shadow 1 and 2 upset me. making SATAN the villain in Castlevania is just bad
[2:02:38] <+youngjwilliams> what do you use for meat?
[2:02:52] <%twistedj3ster> you promise?
[2:02:56] <TioXyco> CRAZY TALK! ACTIVATE
[2:02:57] <OldManDeckardCain> uhuh
[2:02:58] <Asuterisuku> Says Pat when dying to mooks.

[2:03:18] <Asuterisuku> LUL
[2:03:18] <%NigelSchnauzerpug> I don't make chili, just chili I've had in my life @youngjwilliams
[2:03:20] <%Beetlewins> ahaha
[2:03:22] <%Sotetsu> psaWrong
[2:03:22] <+youngjwilliams> was that crazy talk?
[2:03:23] <+Grayhammatter> he would NEVER DIE
[2:03:23] <+superchronicc> pat fought the lazer and the lazer won
[2:03:24] <%MegadBlitz> that wasn't Pat guys, Samus died.

[2:03:32] <Enajy314> LUL
[2:03:33] <@TheYellowcouch> Pats don't die, they just respawn
[2:03:34] <$Jaxnos> SPOUTIN A GOOFY MOVIE LINES LMAO
[2:03:40] <%ShinobiPhoenix> my experience with Mirror of Fate was buying it at Gamestop and looking at the box art nad going "wait... Dracula is Gabriel, but he still has Trevor and Alucard is in this game... OMG they made Trevor into Alucard now didn't they?!"
[2:03:48] <+D00msDayDan> those succ enemies succ in bombs too
[2:04:05] <Asuterisuku> You can get a bit of extra height by abusing the Coyote Time associated with the slide.
[2:04:09] <%ShinobiPhoenix> and GUESS WHAT HAPPENS IN MIRROR OF FATE
[2:04:18] <marvel877> was AFK, did Pat die to some jobber enemy?
[2:04:25] <ThatGuyThere03> yes
[2:04:27] <+youngjwilliams> yup
[2:04:28] <Asuterisuku> Yup.
[2:04:30] <+superchronicc> @ShinobiPhoenix they fight a mirror?
[2:04:37] <olaksi> yes it was very embarrassing
[2:04:41] <%ospreyworks> Mirror of Fate: You know what's better than having a lot of cool characters? Compressing them into fewer, shittier characters!
[2:04:42] <%ShinobiPhoenix> kind of that too
[2:04:50] <fairore> @D00msDayDan thats hot bro
[2:04:57] <%hewlettfan96> That’s a lot of energy drinks Pat
[2:04:57] <OldManDeckardCain> truly the dark souls of metroid games Kappa
[2:05:04] <+superchronicc> cant excape from crossing fate
[2:05:08] <%ShinobiPhoenix> and then the END of Lords of Shadow 2 is just TRASH
[2:05:10] <Shwepie> You have three dashes.
[2:05:12] <DoctorMulholland> Double dash Pat
[2:05:14] <Onatamana> you can airdash multiple times, pat
[2:05:14] <Asuterisuku> You do get more than one dash.
[2:05:17] <%twistedj3ster> you can dash 3 times, right?
[2:05:19] <TioXyco> can't you triple aeirion dash?
[2:05:23] <marvel877> you have 3 dashes, Pat
[2:05:26] <%ShinobiPhoenix> the final boss is Alucard/Trevor suddenly possessed by SATAN
[2:05:26] <%baronouroboros> congration pat
[2:05:31] <+superchronicc> I would suggest saving so you dont have to keep getting the upgrade
[2:05:37] <%ospreyworks> ugh
[2:05:42] <%Cozy90> conglaturation
[2:06:04] <%twistedj3ster> just run past them
[2:06:08] <%ShinobiPhoenix> and the way Gabriel BECOMES Dracula is so ass
[2:06:13] <%ShinobiPhoenix> AND it was PAID DLC
[2:06:33] <%ShinobiPhoenix> the main crux of their own shitty story was behind a PAID DLC WALL
[2:06:47] <olaksi> the fart monster is too powerful
[2:06:51] <%Cozy90> pat u gotta shoot the guy
[2:06:58] <ThatGuyThere03> are you guys talking about those GoW looking Castlevania games?
[2:06:58] <TioXyco> @ShinobiPhoenix like the true ending in Asura's Wrath
[2:07:00] <%ospreyworks> @shinobiphoenix you know what's a shame? I really like Robert Carlyle, rhe guy who voices Dracula in lords of shadow
[2:07:01] <Treasure_Vault> So you can sequence break that red orb here, but it's not easy.
[2:07:05] <%greasypete00> icky tentacles
[2:07:07] <%ShinobiPhoenix> it's even on BC on Xbox RIGHT NOW and it's not a complete package, so EVEN NOW, you have to PAY FOR THE REAL ENDING
[2:07:09] <Asuterisuku> Good, keep not liking it.
[2:07:10] <+superchronicc> LUL
[2:07:13] <%ospreyworks> and they wasted him on that shit entry
[2:07:14] <%twistedj3ster> Raven Beak is trying to resurrect Space Dracula
[2:07:23] <%ShinobiPhoenix> that whole gaming generation is stupid
[2:07:24] <%Puhff> No, I will not
[2:07:26] <+Double_Tap_That> LUL
[2:07:27] <%ShinobiPhoenix> for that
[2:07:29] <Zezuar> @PatStaresAt have you considered making a highlights channel?
[2:07:43] <+Evendrag> its a swampass
[2:07:45] <TioXyco> @twistedj3ster thought he was trying to ressurrect Jason X
[2:07:46] <+superchronicc> IS RAVEN BEAK THE VERGIL?
[2:07:57] <%doc_ock_rokc> What rating is this game again?
[2:07:57] <%Deft_Thought> Clearly its the Tree of Might
[2:07:58] <%RealThiele> yea noone from konami looked at lords of shadow on the exec team. Dread had sakamoto riding their asses
[2:07:59] <Saltmeisterr> @superchronicc yes
[2:07:59] <DrillStopsNoCops> @ShinobiPhoenix fucking yes. some scummy shit was tried that gen
[2:08:07] <%NigelSchnauzerpug> We should have Castlevania in space. I was to see Astronaut Simon Belmont vs. Cosmonaut Dracula.
[2:08:13] <Saltmeisterr> Birdgil, if you will
[2:08:16] <%ShinobiPhoenix> @ShinobiPhoenix I argue Lords of Shadow is worse, you can feel satisfied by Asura until you know there's more
[2:08:23] <Zezuar> fuck this boss
[2:08:27] <Martian571> Pretty much every boss can be seen at some point earlier in the game.
[2:08:30] <Asuterisuku> Konami had a lot more creative control than MS did.
[2:08:32] <%ShinobiPhoenix> but Lords of Shadow is incomplete because you know Gabriel is Dracual
[2:08:36] <+superchronicc> underwater mechanics time
[2:08:38] <+Grayhammatter> this boss took me a bit
[2:08:38] <%ShinobiPhoenix> oh, THIS BOSS
[2:08:41] <Shwepie> Checkpoint reached.
[2:08:41] <%Beetlewins> Time to face the UNDERWATER ANUS
[2:08:44] <Saltmeisterr> look at that CRUSSY
[2:08:45] <%doc_ock_rokc> I've seen enough Scifi to know where this is going?
[2:08:46] <+KaijuUltimax> I forgot this boss existed
[2:08:50] <+ryham_007> monkaS
[2:08:53] <%RealThiele> so theres a way to skip this boss too
[2:08:53] <AngryAsian5> KILL THE HENTAI
[2:08:53] <%ShinobiPhoenix> until you figure out your loop, this boss is ANNOYING
[2:08:54] <+Grayhammatter> underwater ANUS
[2:08:59] <dan_g_v> sphincter time
[2:08:59] <%MegadBlitz> YOOO it's the WORST BOSS
[2:09:00] <%solracc25> anus monster
[2:09:01] <%ShinobiPhoenix> no one tell him the loop
[2:09:02] <%hewlettfan96> That looks like a arsehole
[2:09:05] <%captain_thickthighs> the Mother Cloaca
[2:09:12] <%RealThiele> CLUSSY
[2:09:13] <+tempestzephyr> GRAB HIS DICK AND TWIST IT
[2:09:17] <Asuterisuku> It's a puzzle boss. Hard until you figure it out.
[2:09:18] <%ShinobiPhoenix> @megadblitz you think THIS one is hte worse?  I don't know about that
[2:09:20] <%hewlettfan96> Hentai water monster
[2:09:20] <Asuterisuku> Figure it out, Pat.
[2:09:24] <+Funky_Honkey> shoot button
[2:09:27] <%RealThiele> LUL
[2:09:29] <%ShinobiPhoenix> no one tell him the rest
[2:09:32] <Martian571> Tbf a lot of see creatures look like naughty bits
[2:09:33] <+Grayhammatter> yep, you'll figure it out
[2:09:33] <%AncelDeLambert> this one is a damn pain first time
[2:09:34] <DoctorMulholland> This thing reminds me of the Jabu Jabu boss
[2:09:34] <%whyskeywolfe> omg it’s a fight with Pat’s arteries
[2:09:35] <marvel877> Button

[2:12:23] <%ShinobiPhoenix> Samus's Shade game is very on point
[2:12:23] <SaltyAzteca> OHHHHHHHHHHHhhhhhhhh.....its nothing
[2:12:24] <Aeroallways> wtf? I used nothing but missiles in my fight and he didn't die that fast?
[2:12:25] <Kaji04> N i c e
[2:12:26] <%RealThiele> AINT EVEN GOT A PHASE TWO
[2:12:27] <%SaphronBlackbourne> I really like the boss theme tho

[2:12:38] <%captain_thickthighs> missle the prolapse samus
[2:12:42] <Louie_Salmon> Nah but really that's it
[2:12:46] <T_Sasquatch> you can feel the expression from a blank helmet, its amazing
[2:12:46] <Saltmeisterr> @Alzero83 he can't get it
[2:12:48] <Asuterisuku> That's a not yet item.
[2:12:51] <miabyte> so speedrunners skip that boss because it's unnecessary
[2:12:51] <%SaphronBlackbourne> It actually does have a phase 2
[2:12:51] <%SaiyanShoto> I really love Samus in this game
[2:12:53] <%hewlettfan96> OOOOOOOOh no phase 2  either LUL
[2:12:53] <Onatamana> Chozo: We are peaceful stewards of nature.  Samus: Haha wildlife go brrrrrrrrrr.
[2:12:59] <%SaphronBlackbourne> It's just short
[2:13:02] <+Grayhammatter> not yet
[2:13:07] <%RealThiele> yea hes easily skipped boss its great
[2:13:12] <$Captainahab_37> how much backtracking we got up in this Metroid game
[2:13:19] <wantedsafe471> gotta tarzan it
[2:13:20] <%SaiyanShoto> You can skip that boss?
[2:13:24] <%hewlettfan96> @t_sasquatch I know her body language was all you needed
[2:13:25] <%twohitgood> there's one brick left.
[2:13:28] <ChaoticDaKiller> it's actually kinda wild you speedran through this run first try
[2:13:30] <%ShinobiPhoenix> @Onatamana that's just one tribe, one of them is also fuck nature, can't speak for the others from the manga
[2:13:32] <fairore> @Captainahab_37 yes
[2:13:33] <miabyte> @saiyanshoto yup
[2:13:33] <+superchronicc> the one thing i dont get about the lore is that the chozo were super dead, but here we are fighting chozo
[2:13:36] <olaksi> pat you missed a block
[2:13:39] <%twohitgood> you missed a brick.
[2:13:43] <%PhantomMiG> @saiyanshoto A skip has been found
[2:13:43] <%RealThiele> yes you just skip his room entirely and shoot the door above the boss room with fake wave beam
[2:13:57] <$Captainahab_37> I haven't played a TOODEE Metroid since fusion
[2:14:01] <%ShinobiPhoenix> Apparently the Choose your Own ADventure Live Game Metroid is in English now
[2:14:03] <redwidow1358> Because not all of the Chozo were super dead. NOW they are. @superchronicc
[2:14:09] <%NigelSchnauzerpug> @superchronicc THey got better.
[2:14:14] <i_chevalier> @superchronicc so far as we know, remember parasites xbox can copy living things
[2:14:14] <dan_g_v> gottim
[2:14:16] <moonmeh> those fuckers
[2:14:17] <%ShinobiPhoenix> so a lost non-canon Metroid game is playable now
[2:14:18] <Asuterisuku> LUL
[2:14:19] <%RealThiele> peace out
[2:14:20] <wantedsafe471> Kaizo Metroid
[2:14:24] <+tempestzephyr> LIES
[2:14:27] <marvel877> @superchronicc they're like Kryptonians or Time Lords, they keep showing up after saying they're all dead.
[2:14:28] <Asuterisuku> The game does some trolling.
[2:14:30] <haisho> aww it didn't get him
[2:14:35] <%doc_ock_rokc> BIRD UP
[2:14:36] <ammobasket> Lol
[2:14:39] <%zarkazeon> oooooo best area time?
[2:14:40] <%ShinobiPhoenix> Samus literally fights a guy with a sword
[2:14:42] <ChaoticDaKiller> those troll pitfalls are like the opposite of hidden blocks
[2:14:46] <%Monkeyweed21> fake walls, fake floors, fake ceilings, fake doors
[2:14:48] <$realm_forge> The walls aren’t just liars they’re trolls
[2:14:49] <%zarkazeon> yaaaaa
[2:15:01] <Treasure_Vault> you thought WRONG
[2:15:02] <%doc_ock_rokc> Real Fake doors
[2:15:03] <%razielhex> @Monkeyweed21 wait, Metroid Dread is STILL THE COMMERCIAL!?
[2:15:04] <$Captainahab_37> The walls will gaslight you
[2:15:09] <+Grayhammatter> another area to go to
[2:15:19] <%ShinobiPhoenix> @marvel877 Chozos are Vulcan/Romulans mixed with Time Lords, yes
[2:15:21] <+Grayhammatter> walls gaslight you LUL
[2:15:23] <%KippyLuvsU> KippyLuvsU subscribed at Tier 1. They've subscribed for 7 months! didn't have money for subs but i'm finally back <3
[2:15:24] <Treasure_Vault> You'll get there soon enough
[2:15:26] <Asuterisuku> Welcome to the Jungle
[2:15:29] <+superchronicc> is dark souls 1 just a metroid vania in the 3rdd dimension?
[2:15:30] <%Piemono> He has several areas left
[2:15:34] <$Captainahab_37> oh this game is really pretty
[2:15:35] <%RealThiele> the elevators are a lie too
[2:15:42] <%captain_thickthighs> You wil get to your ship when you get there
[2:15:46] <Martian571> I like the weird skinless alien deer for some reason
[2:15:48] <Asuterisuku> @superchronicc Unironically yes.
[2:15:50] <%peachy996> I see first sector of Fusion in this
[2:15:53] <$Captainahab_37> is this a good one?! I was hoping its a good Metroid game
[2:15:54] <jorniev> man samus must really hate the wild life of all the planet she is been through
[2:16:04] <Asuterisuku> No going back.
[2:16:06] <%ShinobiPhoenix> Chozo:  we have weird crazy space technology that could save the universe but we also used to be warmonging conquerers
[2:16:08] <+JivetheSuperTurkey> Is the Rise demo on the schedule? you played the switch version
[2:16:08] <%SaphronBlackbourne> @Captainahab_37 It's so good
[2:16:09] <fairore> yep
[2:16:12] <+Grayhammatter> yes, yes it did
[2:16:15] <%RealThiele> shits locked
[2:16:24] <Asuterisuku> @Captainahab_37 It's an easy contender for the best in the series.
[2:16:33] <%Niney_Who> Niney_Who subscribed at Tier 1. They've subscribed for 34 months, currently on a 34 month streak! To be fair the Warmonging ones are a different tribe
[2:16:43] <Saltmeisterr> bomb jump?
[2:16:49] <huskarl_zap> METROID BREAD
[2:16:49] <%ShinobiPhoenix> this game is number 1 for me unless they remake Super
[2:16:50] <$Captainahab_37> I hope Prime 4 isn't lies and deceit
[2:16:58] <Gelphaze> That tree just ate that deer!
[2:16:59] <+Grayhammatter> round 2
[2:16:59] <%ShinobiPhoenix> and I HATE Rankings
[2:17:14] <$realm_forge> Oh wow an alien scrotum spider
[2:17:17] <%RealThiele> Robo Birdgil
[2:17:17] <%Bane_Kaikyo> I was so pissed when the second one showed up
[2:17:33] <fairore> i really like how the gravtiy suit looks in this game
[2:17:33] <%ShinobiPhoenix> oh Pat came through the front door of Forest Zone
[2:17:36] <+superchronicc> is the prime series its own separate story, or does it count toward all of it?
[2:17:43] <%trackles_64> F
[2:17:44] <+JivetheSuperTurkey> yo that parry looked fuckin sick
[2:17:46] <SaltyAzteca> Awwwwwwwwwwwww
[2:17:46] <vstpnv> dread's marauder
[2:17:49] <Asuterisuku> I know it doesn't look like it's taking damage, but it is.
[2:17:49] <huskarl_zap> LUL
[2:17:49] <%Niney_Who> Spamming missiles on these guys doesn't work, it's weird
[2:17:49] <Kaji04> man that was a good parry
[2:17:49] <slatersev> Prime is canon
[2:17:49] <$Captainahab_37> It still scares me when Dark Samus shows up in Fusion
[2:17:52] <%twistedj3ster> this fucker took me forever
[2:17:53] <slatersev> but its a sub story
[2:17:54] <huskarl_zap> lmao even
[2:17:55] <fairore> @superchronicc it counts
[2:17:55] <+sonofthedeepsouth> LUL
[2:17:55] <%valriot> shinespark this fool
[2:17:55] <%RealThiele> prime takes place between 1 and 2
[2:17:55] <%Niney_Who> if you spam as fast as possible they take no damage
[2:17:57] <DrillStopsNoCops> Casual filter time
[2:17:58] <sirjames079> These motherfuckers do so much damage on hit
[2:18:00] <%Niney_Who> You gotta like space it out by a second
[2:18:04] <Azathotic> @superchronicc Prime never gets mentioned in non-Prime games sadly
[2:18:05] <@GeneralSCPatton> @superchronicc Prime is prequel
[2:18:06] <Saltmeisterr> @superchronicc its between 1 and 2 but it basically is
[2:18:09] <%RealThiele> hunters for the DS takes place after prime 1
[2:18:12] <Martian571> @superchronicc It's like a side story that fits in between (I think) 1 and 2.
[2:18:12] <%ShinobiPhoenix> since we're here, I can say finding the Orange Teleporter early helps a lot for reasons I won't say
[2:18:14] <%Teyaric> can that blue be grapped?
[2:18:14] <+DeepPix3l> So if Samus just gets blown tf up by the robots doesnt Raven Beak lose his master plan?
[2:18:15] <+Evendrag> my reviewer brain cant beat this game, buhuuuuu
[2:18:24] <rosabellamelantha> @superchronicc Prime swaps between canon and non canon depending on how much sakamoto hates it that day
[2:18:24] <vstpnv> @superchronicc prime is between 1 and 2, but it's pretty self contained
[2:18:25] <miabyte> just so you know pat, you can shine spark into these guys and do damage
[2:18:27] <+sonofthedeepsouth> Chocobos are the best fictional domesticated animal
[2:18:29] <wqorst> maybe don't fight in the cramped hellzone
[2:18:35] <%Niney_Who> @PatStaresAt These guys have a weird quirk where spamming rockets makes them take no damage
[2:18:35] <TheHotStuven> Yeah these guys hurt a lot
[2:18:36] <Asuterisuku> These guys shit out damage.
[2:18:37] <%valriot> You can go in with a shinespark and nuke him
[2:18:42] <+JivetheSuperTurkey> yall try the rise steam demo?
[2:18:45] <fairore> chozo tech dont fuck around
[2:18:46] <%ShinobiPhoenix> Prime (with Hunters) is between 1 and 2
[2:18:47] <%Piemono> Yeah close quarters favor those dudes
[2:18:48] <Martian571> @DeepPix3l You an extract DNA from a dead body
[2:18:51] <jorniev> BIRD UP
[2:18:52] <%RealThiele> your E-tanks mean nothing to him
[2:18:52] <%ShinobiPhoenix> all of Prime
[2:18:53] <%Niney_Who> Gotta space them out a bit yeah
[2:18:54] <$Captainahab_37> They take their anti-rocket medication
[2:18:56] <+bugz_munny> if you dont parry that melee hit its gonna be 2+ bars of your health
[2:18:59] <Azathotic> Man this chat is backseaty as all hell
[2:19:02] <+superchronicc> gotcha
[2:19:03] <@GeneralSCPatton> Wait, is Prime trilogy before or after 1? I thought it established where Mother Brain came from with the Aurora Units
[2:19:04] <%ShinobiPhoenix> followed by Samus Returns
[2:19:09] <%doc_ock_rokc> BIRD UP
[2:19:12] <+Grayhammatter> wait, you can shine spark into this room? LUL
[2:19:13] <%ShinobiPhoenix> I forgot when Federation Force is now
[2:19:15] <slatersev> After 1
[2:19:15] <Calek> prime is after 1 and before 2
[2:19:18] <slatersev> before 2
[2:19:18] <Asuterisuku> That's a visual lie on this robot in particular, just spam them.
[2:19:24] <Ravioli_Ronin> Have you tried hitting him with the bone hurting juice?
[2:19:29] <%ShinobiPhoenix> people also forget Federation Force is canon
[2:19:32] <%RealThiele> federation force is after eden
[2:19:52] <%peachy996> which one is the chozo wearing orange armor?
[2:19:52] <%ScreamLord> It's cool that these robot kinda look like Samus
[2:19:55] <+bugz_munny> jump + dash
[2:19:56] <TheHotStuven> LUL
[2:19:56] <Asuterisuku> Federation Force is the only game in the series I haven't actually played yet.
[2:19:58] <%twistedj3ster> hitboxes on those red slashes are vertically HUGE
[2:19:59] <%TarikBot> Do you have to jump before you dash or can you just dash through him?
[2:20:03] <+superchronicc> dont forget metoird prime hunters
[2:20:07] <%Piemono> Pat facefucking enemies like Paige
[2:20:11] <Saltmeisterr> @ShinobiPhoenix federation force might tie into prime 4 LUL
[2:20:11] <%solracc25> get out of the corner
[2:20:11] <%RealThiele> POINT BLANK
[2:20:12] <+bugz_munny> you have to jump
[2:20:13] <SomeAsianDood> It's time to git gud
[2:20:14] <+zodd_godd> is this the first playthrough?
[2:20:15] <+JivetheSuperTurkey> yo hunters was the shit
[2:20:16] <Asuterisuku> You cannot dash through enemies.
[2:20:16] <%tusk102> i thought the prime games are not part of the main coninuity
[2:20:17] <+Evendrag> even an enemy with a super simple pattern like this is hard when they hit like a truck
[2:20:18] <+bugz_munny> dashing into him causes you damage
[2:20:20] <%Bane_Kaikyo> @twistedj3ster and horizontally as well
[2:20:22] <Make_me_mad> The red slash is bullshit about 75 percent of the time.
[2:20:24] <%ShinobiPhoenix> it's hard to play a game that is permanently $40 bucks on the eShop but it's a 3DS game
[2:20:25] <%TarikBot> darn
[2:20:25] <%SaphronBlackbourne> Tge Chozobots took me quite a few attempts
[2:20:35] <+DeepPix3l> Bro why do they even need metroids? These Chozo robots slap.
[2:20:40] <%RealThiele> i honestly think that EMMIs are designed after the end boss of hunters
[2:20:48] <%ShinobiPhoenix> it's like DO YOU WANT TO SPEND $40 bucks for a 480p game on a 2 inch screen
[2:20:49] <%Bane_Kaikyo> @SaphronBlackbourne Same
[2:20:52] <+Grayhammatter> these guys are a joke with later power ups
[2:21:01] <+superchronicc> @ShinobiPhoenix that's just nintendo in general, youre probably better off emulating it
[2:21:12] <+bugz_munny> These guys are a joke later because you can bait the crap out of them
[2:21:16] <+bugz_munny> this is the hardest of these in the game
[2:21:20] <+JivetheSuperTurkey> yes please emulate it, they dont deserve the money
[2:21:21] <+megaman_sentinel> is he counting rocket
[2:21:30] <%Monkeyweed21> you cant jump it you have to dash
[2:21:31] <%Niney_Who> This arena makes it hell yeah
[2:21:31] <%ShinobiPhoenix> @ShinobiPhoenix it's not Nintendo though, it's everyone who stopped selling on certain platforms
[2:21:31] <%Piemono> The stage favors this guy
[2:21:31] <huskarl_zap> what if samus were a gurl?
[2:21:32] <+Evendrag> he's real
[2:21:34] <miabyte> shine spark his ass
[2:21:36] <%RealThiele> red means ded
[2:21:37] <%zarkazeon> these guys r not fun
[2:21:38] <WetMajestic> @bugz_munny yeah agreed, I think your weapons are just too weak
[2:21:38] <%captain_thickthighs> this is the Dark SOuls of Metrovanis
[2:21:44] <%valriot> Do a shinspark on him, its crazy strong
[2:21:45] <%Piemono> next time try final destination, no tiems
[2:21:45] <AzureFlame98> This bird bots got one hell of an anti air
[2:21:49] <@GeneralSCPatton> Chozo know how to make a mean robot
[2:21:51] <%solracc25> bad corner
[2:21:58] <majindusto> BIRD SHORYUKEN enigmaS
[2:21:59] <+bugz_munny> Red = Jump and dash
[2:22:00] <Asuterisuku> Except you're not connecting to the multiplayer features via emulation, and it's a coop focused game.
[2:22:00] <%WeLucklessJacks> Just got my ass kicked by this guy a little while ago.
[2:22:02] <%ShinobiPhoenix> when a game stopped matters, they just leave the sales as is, you can't say ONLY Nintendo is doing that
[2:22:05] <%RealThiele> and do it it fucking early
[2:22:05] <+bugz_munny> flashing is counter
[2:22:06] <+eddie_hedgehog> i always found it better to just jump and dash back when does the reds strike
[2:22:14] <+geekjacob> wait is this not a space pirate?
[2:22:19] <%doc_ock_rokc> Bird family knew how to kick ass
[2:22:27] <Asuterisuku> This is not a space pirate.
[2:22:28] <purple9z> probably the third hardest fight in the game imo
[2:22:29] <%RealThiele> This be a Chzo robro
[2:22:31] <%Daxalog> Its a robot
[2:22:33] <%ShinobiPhoenix> I am shocked with occassionally some Capcom or Square game goes on sale on 3DS still and it won't be every game
[2:22:37] <miabyte> @geekjacob chozo robot
[2:22:40] <AzureFlame98> Its a Chozo warrior bot but it definitely does remind me of the Space Pirates from Prime 1
[2:22:48] <huskarl_zap> what if samus were a bounty hunter
[2:22:48] <%ShinobiPhoenix> all the Level 5 games are permanently whatever price they are now
[2:22:49] <+bugz_munny> i know right?
[2:22:49] <$ItsRatman> I was gonna suggest coming back after more upgrades but youre locked into the zone huh
[2:22:49] <+D00msDayDan> the red one comes out so fast it's hard to tell when he's doing the attack you can parry and react in time
[2:22:52] <Asuterisuku> They DO take the damage, the lack of a damage flash is a visual bug.
[2:22:53] <%trackles_64> So you wis h the game was more ez
[2:22:54] <%RealThiele> parry or die
[2:22:56] <%RealThiele> i hate it
[2:22:58] <%ShinobiPhoenix> hell, the Vita is a GREAT EXAMPLE
[2:22:59] <%doc_ock_rokc> Chozo bot thinks you are a metroid
[2:23:00] <WetMajestic> do enemies in other metroid games ever have health bars
[2:23:00] <%SaiyanShoto> That's be too easy
[2:23:00] <%captain_thickthighs> you got parry dude only way
[2:23:01] <%Niney_Who> Oh it is?
[2:23:02] <%Mr_Pylon> I spammed rockets and I was fine?
[2:23:02] <%ForlornCarton> You can spam rockets
[2:23:02] <%Niney_Who> fuck
[2:23:03] <Treasure_Vault> shinespark from the getgo
[2:23:03] <+qwazzeon> I mean, spamming rockets is how I beat them.
[2:23:05] <%zzNamttamzz> Bird bot wins
[2:23:06] <%SaphronBlackbourne> I spammed them and I was fine
[2:23:06] <+geekjacob> @miabyte oh dang
[2:23:15] <zentzen> you can
[2:23:16] <+superchronicc> @ShinobiPhoenix online retailer is another option to buy physical
[2:23:17] <%solracc25> you can
[2:23:21] <%greasypete00> these guys are so aggressive too
[2:23:21] <%ShinobiPhoenix> there's so many PSP and Vita games that are still $40 bucks are more
[2:23:21] <+bugz_munny> still gotta dodge lol
[2:23:28] <Onatamana> botched attempt
[2:23:34] <%RealThiele> mash deez nuts
[2:23:35] <jorniev> dont you have lasers?
[2:23:35] <+bugz_munny> hes gonna kick your ass still dont dodge lol
[2:23:39] <%Niney_Who> Oh yeah that's a good idea. What if you just shinespark his ass before entering the bossroom?
[2:23:40] <%TarikBot> What if you just cloak and kinda. Leave.
[2:23:42] <%SaiyanShoto> Oh wait I thought you meant just stand there and spam rockets like nothing LUL
[2:23:51] <%ShinobiPhoenix> physical can be more expensive, easy to lose or degrade
[2:23:52] <@Moobot> Hey folks, just a reminder! If you have Twitch connected to Discord, you can access the PSA Sub-Discord. Go to your User Settings, go to Connections, and click 'Join' on the PSA server under the Twitch connection.
[2:23:52] <+qwazzeon> idk if he has missile lock on yet but for me that was the best way to handle them.
[2:23:52] <@TheYellowcouch> Almost makes you miss the emmis
[2:23:54] <%Issun135> uh oh
[2:23:56] <Saltmeisterr> @jorniev robots are anti laser
[2:24:04] <%solracc25> corner bad
[2:24:05] <%Issun135> its robochozo
[2:24:08] <jorniev> damn
[2:24:08] <%ShinobiPhoenix> not every game is physical and NOT every game is digital either
[2:24:08] <%valriot> prep a shinespark on the run up to the room, its big dps
[2:24:09] <%baka_sugoi> sbfpSetIn
[2:24:11] <+bugz_munny> no dash
[2:24:14] <%SaiyanShoto> Shinespark fucks these guys up, they die in two but I think he could only get one in this fight
[2:24:15] <SaltyAzteca> That move is so fast
[2:24:15] <%captain_thickthighs> parry
[2:24:19] <%Mr_Pylon> tough boss, huh
[2:24:21] <%alcors_wisdom> seems i came at a good time
[2:24:25] <%RealThiele> or diee
[2:24:26] <jorniev> red blade means run away
[2:24:26] <Onjani> Fight him above
[2:24:27] <+spawnzie> the other one
[2:24:30] <%ShinobiPhoenix> Sony game in particular have already been lost because of how many are PHYSICAL only
[2:24:31] <%tusk102> parry blue
[2:24:35] <+bugz_munny> The red one acts as like a psuedo counter
[2:24:36] <%captain_thickthighs> they have yellows
[2:24:37] <%RealThiele> parry blue
[2:24:38] <bleugh> yeah probably shouldn't back off into a corner
[2:24:38] <lloyddboy> frames
[2:24:39] <+DeepPix3l> The frames from wind up to punch are nuts. This mf playin melee
[2:24:40] <+eddie_hedgehog> just dash back with the red one
[2:24:43] <+superchronicc> i just ran away from these guys
[2:24:43] <$realm_forge> I wanna fight the anus again
[2:24:44] <+bugz_munny> if a missle is already in the air it will be fast
[2:24:54] <%doc_ock_rokc> I miss dissida
[2:24:56] <marvel877> Stream hitching for anyone else?
[2:24:57] <%ShinobiPhoenix> and if no one cares much for a certain game that game is gone other than emulation
[2:24:57] <Onjani> He's really fighting him in the CBT caves
[2:24:58] <inouye> try top left where he comes out
[2:25:02] <$ItsRatman> Cmon Pat wreck his robo cloaca
[2:25:02] <inouye> it's more open
[2:25:03] <Treasure_Vault> Shinespark him
[2:25:07] <+bugz_munny> Gotta fight this
[2:25:09] <$Jaxnos> parries would appear to be not required but highly advised for these guys
[2:25:09] <Waypastfuture> I think you have barely enough ground from the door to the room to get a shinespark going as you enter
[2:25:10] <%RealThiele> bit rate go brrr?
[2:25:12] <TheHotStuven> yeah stream is hitching a bit
[2:25:13] <NoKingArthur> after being murdered by these guys repeatedly while trying to dash over them, I think the move is to jump forward then dash, not jump straight up
[2:25:21] <+bugz_munny> DOOOOODGE
[2:25:23] <%Issun135> flashshift over the red attack
[2:25:26] <%Niney_Who> Try a shinespark?
[2:25:26] <%solracc25> dude you have tons of space upwards
[2:25:27] <wqorst> WR loss
[2:25:27] <+bugz_munny> DOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOODGE
[2:25:27] <Treasure_Vault> Shinespark
[2:25:28] <Asuterisuku> He's dying faster now...
[2:25:30] <%Piemono> He's getting worse guys
[2:25:32] <%RealThiele> regression
[2:25:32] <%ShinobiPhoenix> for example: the Phantasy Star Portable games are physical only and PSP only, and PSP is very dead
[2:25:33] <%WeLucklessJacks> I found keeping to the top left helped a bit.
[2:25:34] <%NigelSchnauzerpug> Should someone start a death count?
[2:25:35] <%retrohazard> why not fight in the upper part of the stage
[2:25:45] <+hoenhime344> gohan... DOOOODGE
[2:25:47] <%JGardner03> Dodge faster
[2:25:47] <miabyte> you could go top
[2:25:48] <%trackles_64> No you must dodge more pat
[2:25:48] <majindusto> Pat getting  Robo-Rocked enigmaStun
[2:25:48] <%Niney_Who> Yeah the Red hit can come out earlier than expected and catch you as you dash
[2:25:48] <Onatamana> HE KNOWS THAT HE HAS TO DODGE, IT'S JUST DIFFICULT
[2:25:49] <+bugz_munny> Not fast enough then
[2:25:49] <%ShinobiPhoenix> the red blast hits you out of the dash
[2:25:50] <+megaman_sentinel> stay up top
[2:25:51] <%Mr_Pylon> the fast red sword is brutal
[2:25:51] <jorniev> BUT DODGE THOUG
[2:25:52] <%cvp5127> youre still here?
[2:25:53] <%rkbinder> Dodge better
[2:25:54] <+GTCapone> jump forward and dash
[2:25:57] <%RealThiele> dash earlier
[2:25:58] <%twistedj3ster> Yeah, this fight in particular is bullshit
[2:25:58] <+D00msDayDan> yeah no i-frames on the flash dash
[2:26:01] <+bugz_munny> like if you
[2:26:01] <Onjani> He's got this, he just has to do it
[2:26:02] <%solracc25> It's hard
[2:26:02] <marvel877> No, but dodge faster though
[2:26:03] <%ShinobiPhoenix> the dash DOESN't have I-Frames for the most part
[2:26:03] <miabyte> can we tell pat shinesparks do damage
[2:26:05] <%JGardner03> Just dodge though
[2:26:08] <Louie_Salmon> Yeah but dodge
[2:26:09] <+bugz_munny> get hit it's youre fault in this game lol
[2:26:09] <redwidow1358> If you're getting hit by the red part, you just have to dash sooner
[2:26:10] <%solracc25> that attack is huge
[2:26:14] <%doc_ock_rokc> If the robots win we gotta listen to techno!
[2:26:16] <%Niney_Who> They technically have 2 red attacks. One where they build up and dash at you then swipe, and then one where they just swipe
[2:26:16] <+qwazzeon> Not necessarily dodge, use the room to keep some distance from him and get in missiles while he closes in
[2:26:18] <%ShinobiPhoenix> I did find ONE boss you could dash through barely
[2:26:19] <%greasypete00> Gamer time
[2:26:19] <+D00msDayDan> pat watch out
[2:26:20] <%Mr_Pylon> Spamming wins!
[2:26:21] <$Jaxnos> no damage'd it
[2:26:21] <+qwazzeon> ah never mind
[2:26:21] <%Monkeyweed21> PERFECT
[2:26:22] <%cvp5127> just win pat
[2:26:22] <@TheYellowcouch> gg ez
[2:26:22] <+zoopbooploop> BEAT IT WITHOUT BEING HIT
[2:26:22] <+superchronicc> all SKILL
[2:26:22] <%ShinobiPhoenix> I can't say who
[2:26:22] <Shwepie> Perfect.
[2:26:23] <%SaiyanShoto> GG
[2:26:23] <NoKingArthur> NICE
[2:26:23] <@GeneralSCPatton> FLAWLESS
[2:26:24] <+bugz_munny> Wow look what happens when you  dodge
[2:26:24] <blue8moon> PogChamp
[2:26:25] <@Ranryu692> oh look, you dodged LUL
[2:26:25] <%Monkeyweed21> NO HIT
[2:26:25] <%NigelSchnauzerpug> psaBig psaBig psaBig psaBig
[2:26:26] <%solracc25> unfair huge hitbox
[2:26:26] <majindusto> NEVER STOP FLASH DODGING
[2:26:26] <$ItsRatman> Nice
[2:26:28] <%TarikBot> VICTORY
[2:26:30] <olaksi> looks like jumping behind the baits the parry
[2:26:31] <%baronouroboros> Congration!
[2:26:31] <Blu_C> Good job Pat.
[2:26:32] <%RealThiele> dashed earlier good job
[2:26:33] <Asuterisuku> See? He doesn't flash but he still takes the damage. I bet that'll get patched later.
[2:26:34] <+superchronicc> 1st try everytime
[2:26:36] <%greasypete00> i find moving around the arena makes them a bit easier to fight
[2:26:37] <%Bane_Kaikyo> Speaking from experience, that Red sparky dash he does can come out so fast it will STILL hit you even if you hit all your inputs right
[2:26:37] <%tusk102> @PatStaresAt shinesparks to a ton of damage btw
[2:26:39] <+bugz_munny> lol "unfair"
[2:26:41] <Waypastfuture> nice
[2:26:42] <%solracc25> GG
[2:26:48] <miabyte> ggs
[2:26:51] <jorniev> GOOD job dodging
[2:27:00] <+zoopbooploop> I DIDN'T KNOW YOU COULD GRAPPLE THOSE
[2:27:00] <%RealThiele> LUL
[2:27:01] <+bugz_munny> @Bane_Kaikyo Its a soft counter - spamming missles causes it to come out fast
[2:27:03] <%ShinobiPhoenix> btw-- you can melee out of a Flash
[2:27:04] <+qwazzeon> "dodging"
[2:27:16] <%ShinobiPhoenix> that is actually way more useful than you think offensively
[2:27:26] <%bravebravesrobin> Give me a W!  Give me an H!  Give me a U!  Give me a S!  Give me a S! Give me a Y! What does that spell?  WHUSSY!!! Cheer500
[2:27:27] <+bugz_munny> @qwazzeon Yeah its called not getting hit
[2:27:27] <%RealThiele> when in doubt bomb it out
[2:27:28] <Asuterisuku> This game likes that trick in particular.
[2:27:30] <+bugz_munny> great for living
[2:27:30] <%ShinobiPhoenix> especially for half-screen counters
[2:27:32] <Onatamana> hooray for metroidvania literacy
[2:27:34] <%Niney_Who> This room showed off how grappling sucks ass
[2:27:37] <%RealThiele> YAY WHUSSY
[2:27:40] <%Monkeyweed21> pat was pretending to fail because  otherwise he would beat the game too fast
[2:27:40] <bea_beatdown> @zoopbooploop yo same though. just beat the game, hasn't a clue
[2:27:41] <+McDerpus> I love how those chonky enemies attack you with their butt
[2:27:45] <%solracc25> dash
[2:27:46] <%Bane_Kaikyo> @bugz_munny What the fuck else are you supposed to do?
[2:27:52] <+spawnzie> wee
[2:27:54] <livi242> I
[2:27:58] <%solracc25> just air dash
[2:27:59] <+bugz_munny> DODGE
[2:27:59] <%doc_ock_rokc> Birds wish you to embrase monkey
[2:28:01] <+bugz_munny> AND SHOOT
[2:28:19] <%ShinobiPhoenix> if someone has a dangerous move with a Parry Flash, you can Flash Melee into them safely
[2:28:19] <+bugz_munny> every move can be countered and reacted to
[2:28:22] <Asuterisuku> 2 missiles!
[2:28:25] <+bugz_munny> every one
[2:28:27] <%ShinobiPhoenix> rather than be in range
[2:28:32] <+superchronicc> this game is great, but my only gripe is the controls and the way you have to use mental gymnastics to solve some of these puzzles
[2:28:35] <%RealThiele> the things you do for big number in this game
[2:28:48] <%Bane_Kaikyo> @bugz_munny fuckin chill, geezus
[2:29:00] <blue8moon> sus
[2:29:02] <+bugz_munny> @Bane_Kaikyo Talk shit get shit on
[2:29:12] <%solracc25> yup
[2:29:14] <%ShinobiPhoenix> I love how many moves cancel into other moves in this game
[2:29:16] <%RealThiele> like seriously samus drag them into the lava they offline
[2:29:16] <%tusk102> @bugz_munny dont be a dick
[2:29:23] <+superchronicc> ADAM time
[2:29:35] <%Bane_Kaikyo> @bugz_munny I'm not even talking shit tho?.... and nor were you shitting on me?
[2:29:36] <%SaphronBlackbourne> Also you're blatantly wrong because you can't count every attack, only ones that flash white
[2:29:37] <+hoenhime344> zordon????
[2:29:37] <Saltmeisterr> hi """ADAM"""
[2:29:40] <%ShinobiPhoenix> when i found out the Slide turns into the FLASH Kick when you melee, i lost my mind
[2:29:52] <%ShinobiPhoenix> but what is REALLY useful is that you can melee FROM BALL
[2:29:52] <fairore> @RealThiele what lava ?
[2:29:57] <fairore> where
[2:29:58] <%peachy996> You are shit tier Samus
[2:29:59] <%RealThiele> His dick is pretty big
[2:30:02] <+bugz_munny> Point being yall are terrible if you cant dodge that red flashing attack
[2:30:05] <%ShinobiPhoenix> you would not believe how useful taht is
[2:30:08] <%twistedj3ster> wow, thanks for being in my corner
[2:30:10] <Treasure_Vault> uh huh
[2:30:11] <+spawnzie> Berdgil too stronk
[2:30:12] <+NickHatesSnow> He has a 12 pack
[2:30:12] <%MashinChaserR> big number
[2:30:15] <lloyddboy> MOTIVATED
[2:30:16] <+bugz_munny> I cant see why everyone is bitching that this game is "hard"
[2:30:17] <%notsoy> MOTIVATED Kappa
[2:30:17] <Blank9> now I'm motivated
[2:30:18] <%Treuan> Now he's MOTIVATED
[2:30:18] <StarMechV> He hasn't called yu lady in forever
[2:30:18] <+JonathLP> Birdgil
[2:30:24] <+DeepPix3l> "He is so cool Samus. You are super uncool."
[2:30:25] <%solracc25> you suck
[2:30:25] <marvel877> he called you  a bitch
[2:30:25] <%valriot> On Hard Mode you learn to abuse Shinespark to do damage since its massive and getting hit does huge damage to you
[2:30:30] <%Deft_Thought> "You know they say all Chozo are created equal, but you look at me and you look at Samus and you can see that statement is NOT TRUE! See, normally if you go one-on-one with another Mawkin you got a fifty/fifty chance of winning. But I'm a genetic freak, and I'm not normal!"
[2:30:33] <%RealThiele> @fairore in zone 2 if they were offline id drag their asses back through an elevator dump em in LotR style
[2:30:33] <%Monkeyweed21> Raven Beak is a huge chad that gets all the Chussy
[2:30:35] <%UberKingKai> Hes suckin that bird off
[2:30:36] <+superchronicc> pat is now on rails
[2:30:40] <%cooldude69xx> @bugz_munny Too bad they arent real gamers like you
[2:30:42] <jorniev> no chance thats what you got
[2:30:42] <ammobasket> AND SMALL
[2:30:45] <%cvp5127> his dick is so big
[2:30:45] <%NigelSchnauzerpug> Chat much more aggressive compared to the Dishonored stream yesterday.
[2:30:49] <Asuterisuku> @bugz_munny Oh the game IS hard - but it's a fair challenge and that makes it fun.
[2:30:49] <%solracc25> never ever
[2:31:02] <%TarikBot> Physics
[2:31:06] <+bugz_munny> I mean if you put "dodge" in quotes like its ironic, you're just being dumb
[2:31:09] <%twistedj3ster> WHUSSY
[2:31:09] <%RealThiele> get stick bugged
[2:31:10] <Onatamana> WHAAAAAALES
[2:31:13] <+bugz_munny> because it is that simple

[2:31:46] <%UberKingKai> “This isn’t a message from the federation force I tricked you into reading this”
[2:31:46] <jorniev> swhussy
[2:31:48] <%TarikBot> Why did you bomb the shit out of that majestic creature
[2:32:00] <%blastyoboots> @PatStaresAt you got 99 missiles and a super-missile ain't one-- oh wait
[2:32:01] <%baronouroboros> YAY
[2:32:02] <+superchronicc> THICC Missle acquiredd
[2:32:10] <%Bane_Kaikyo> @bugz_munny You literally said it comes out faster when you spam missiles. Spamming missiles is the only way to really damage it.... ergo it's a herd to dodge move that happens a lot.... quit screaming
[2:32:13] <Asuterisuku> Fusion Style Super Missiles.
[2:32:16] <Alzero83> Replaces normal missle
[2:32:17] <TheHotStuven> BIGGER MISSILE
[2:32:19] <+spawnzie> direct upgrade
[2:32:20] <DoctorMulholland> Just straight up replaces it
[2:32:25] <%RealThiele> LUL
[2:32:26] <+bugz_munny> Reliable damage?
[2:32:26] <+D00msDayDan> missiles are just better now
[2:32:27] <%ShinobiPhoenix> the new Missile system is GREAT and long time come

[2:32:47] <+bugz_munny> Dawg you need to go beat this game on Hard, come back, and tell me that sentence is true
[2:32:53] <lloyddboy> WHUSSY

[2:37:31] <fairore> @ShinobiPhoenix you play smash bros like that
[2:37:34] <%TheLemuroid> So majestic
[2:37:41] <miabyte> the only downside to this game is the long loading times and how frequent they are
[2:37:52] <bazz_tv> and talking about the devil
[2:37:52] <+bugz_munny> ....what?
[2:37:57] <+Subdotmission> wow this game really ripping off Ori..
[2:37:57] <+bugz_munny> Frequent?

[2:51:39] <Asuterisuku> I love that the robots don't drop X.
[2:51:46] <%solracc25> is plasma stronger than rockets?
[2:51:48] <ChaoticDaKiller> you can now fuck up every robotic enemy that's not an EMMI
[2:52:04] <%ShinobiPhoenix> robots also don't have anything to be infected by
[2:52:07] <+NickHatesSnow> No rockets are stronger
[2:52:14] <%RealThiele> i mean at least a beam of molten hot particles sounds like a samus weapon
[2:52:18] <%solracc25> ok
[2:52:25] <+Grayhammatter> oh boy
[2:52:26] <%zarkazeon> robotic/ARMORED
[2:52:27] <%peachy996> Robots can't get infected with X anyway that's why Emmi was sent in
[2:52:30] <+lordericter> its the door snack

[2:53:45] <+bugz_munny> I a fight so good they reuse it three fucking times
[2:53:52] <bazz_tv> these boss fights remind me a lot to the Strider reboot
[2:53:53] <TheHotStuven> LUL
[2:53:55] <$realm_forge> Well….that escalated quickly
[2:53:56] <%ShinobiPhoenix> though I wonder if the X could possess a technoorganic entity as opposed to just a Biomechanical entity
[2:53:59] <Saltmeisterr> @PatStaresAt Plasma beam can hurt bosses btw
[2:53:59] <@Moobot> Hey folks, just a reminder! If you have Twitch connected to Discord, you can access the PSA Sub-Discord. Go to your User Settings, go to Connections, and click 'Join' on the PSA server under the Twitch connection.

[2:54:51] <%solracc25> that's some mashing

[2:56:49] <%RealThiele> PLANETS GOTTA GO
[2:56:51] <Treasure_Vault> The door closed behind her when she came in
[2:56:51] <%scaryboisupreme> The next data room is really funny
[2:56:52] <%ShinobiPhoenix> Samus broke ANOTHER planet, we're up to like 5 now
[2:56:58] <SaltyAzteca> Oh.............................LEVEL 5 FUCKY WUCKY
[2:57:00] <+Grayhammatter> planets fucked, nice job pat
[2:57:03] <Make_me_mad> Samus is a one woman exterminatus.
[2:57:03] <bazz_tv> COVID for everybody
[2:57:03] <Saltmeisterr> @NigelSchnauzerpug But she did tho
[2:57:04] <wqorst> metroid got a new gun so it's worth it
[2:57:04] <+bugz_munny> Planet's huanted
[2:57:04] <Calamity2007> @DoctorMulholland I feel every sector has one, kind of like a prize
[2:57:09] <ElenaManetta> she's a human
[2:57:10] <+NickHatesSnow> Cuz it's cool
[2:57:12] <%solracc25> You how this always ends
[2:57:13] <ElenaManetta> kinda
[2:57:14] <olaksi> planet's dying sam
[2:57:15] <%doc_ock_rokc> @ShinobiPhoenix 5 that we are AWARE of
[2:57:17] <Alzero83> Samus has destroyed every planet with Chozo Ruins....
[2:57:18] <%watts121> ball maze
[2:57:19] <TioXyco> part of the job description, probably
[2:57:21] <%Deft_Thought> She's built to kill
[2:57:22] <jorniev> RAISED BY CHOZO
[2:57:24] <%retrohazard> The metroid series is all about a woman who visits a bunch of planets and destroys each of them.
[2:57:32] <Blu_C> Good job hero.
[2:57:34] <%ShinobiPhoenix> Samus is a TERRIBLE Bounty Hunter, it's called DEAD OR ALIVE, and she's just ignores rthe Alive option
[2:57:39] <%Deft_Thought> if you could run fast enough to slam through walls and people, you'd wanna keep busy too
[2:57:41] <+bugz_munny> they had it coming
[2:57:41] <%NigelSchnauzerpug> @NigelSchnauzerpug Then she should have locked it.
[2:57:42] <%scaryboisupreme> Well Samus doesn't destroy most of them intentionally
[2:57:43] <%ElkRiverDog> Can you think of a better way to send a message?
[2:57:45] <+NickHatesSnow> She's very thorough, it's why she's the best
[2:57:45] <Asuterisuku> Hey now, it's only happened three times.
[2:57:46] <%solracc25> Raised by psyco birds
[2:57:48] <%peachy996> You must destroy planet to save galaxy
[2:57:49] <%saiyanblitz> It’s the only way she can get off
[2:57:50] <%blaccbird914> blaccbird914 subscribed with Prime. They've subscribed for 38 months! 
[2:57:51] <+spawnzie> this is revenge for all the PBs she lost because she ha to save the animals
[2:57:52] <ElenaManetta> maybe it's like a hunter ego thing. what's the biggest game of all? planets.
[2:57:57] <DeeVee_TV> how many planets we up to?
[2:58:02] <+bugz_munny> acutally she didnt destroy Prime 2's
[2:58:05] <Calamity2007> @TioXyco I like to imagine that whenever the Galactic Federation hires Samus they always have to expect a destroyed planet as part of the operational cost
[2:58:07] <Asuterisuku> Three.
[2:58:13] <%doc_ock_rokc> @ShinobiPhoenix If they didn't want them dead they shouldn't put it on the poster
[2:58:15] <+bugz_munny> So she gets that one
[2:58:15] <Asuterisuku> Zebes, SR388, Phaaze.
[2:58:17] <%tusk102> @DeeVee_TV 3
[2:58:21] <akitanito> you won't mind if batarians lived in them
[2:58:21] <p3niletrauma> Are these little bombs unlimited?
[2:58:25] <TioXyco> @Calamity2007 if they don't they are kinda derping
[2:58:30] <%ShinobiPhoenix> she is actually like the biggest threat in the galaxy considering all the planets that just HAPPEN to blow up if she's involved
[2:58:32] <hollumdusk> Dark Aether, Phaze, Zebes and SR388 in that order, until the events of Dread
[2:58:35] <%tusk102> is prime canon
[2:58:38] <%scaryboisupreme> Well Zebes was destroyed by Mother Brain
[2:58:43] <CrazyMedicine> do space stations count?
[2:58:44] <%scaryboisupreme> Yes
[2:58:46] <%RealThiele> Yellow X heal for 40 too
[2:58:47] <%ShinobiPhoenix> in Fusion she litearlly blew up a planet the game didn't take place on
[2:58:49] <+NickHatesSnow> 3 planets and at least 2 alien races possibly 4 if you include mother brain and ridley.
[2:58:50] <+bugz_munny> @ShinobiPhoenix Fuck that shit metroids have to go
[2:58:51] <Asuterisuku> I don't count Dark Aether.
[2:58:52] <hollumdusk> unless I miss a planet in Hunters
[2:58:56] <%Bane_Kaikyo> @tusk102 Yes takes place between 1 and 2
[2:58:57] <%peachy996> And the X only seem harmless because Samus is immune, every other living thing, not so lucky
[2:58:58] <%Piemono> I keep feeling like Pat should have the Scan ability already
[2:59:03] <%solracc25> baited
[2:59:06] <GenericSoda> @hollumdusk Does Dark Aether actually exist in reality? Or is it a weird dimensional thing?
[2:59:07] <Manwad> wasn't phaaze like alive
[2:59:08] <+bugz_munny> BURN ALL METROIDS
[2:59:10] <%TarikBot> MYSTERIOUS
[2:59:10] <%tusk102> @tusk102 weird
[2:59:12] <%greasypete00> oh wow what could it ever be
[2:59:13] <SaltyAzteca> WHAT COULD IT BEEEE
[2:59:14] <%solracc25> not yet
[2:59:15] <Calamity2007> @TioXyco I like to assume so because the Federation really didn't hold any grudges against her for Fusion
[2:59:17] <+spawnzie> guess we'll never know
[2:59:18] <%scaryboisupreme> Sakamoto lat Merc Steam put Meta Ridley in to keep consistency
[2:59:20] <%Deft_Thought> Number ??? of ??? acquired
[2:59:21] <Alzero83> Liar, You know
[2:59:22] <+bugz_munny> Literally there has never been a good metroid ever
[2:59:25] <ape_hawk> seems like its building up to something hmmmmmm
[2:59:25] <+bugz_munny> EEEEEEEEVER
[2:59:27] <ElenaManetta> is spamming bombs the actual trick, or is this a "roll constantly, you look dumb but it works better" incidental strat
[2:59:29] <DeeVee_TV> time stop canister
[2:59:34] <+Grayhammatter> mysterious unknown item
[2:59:37] <%Issun135> ???/15 max for that item
[2:59:39] <ElenaManetta> like in games where rolling is faster
[2:59:41] <Calek> @ElenaManetta it's how you play a metroid game
[2:59:43] <%RealThiele> drama queen LUL
[2:59:50] <%scaryboisupreme> @Calamity2007 cause it was a rogue black ops unit that was making metroids in Fusion
[2:59:52] <%ShinobiPhoenix> you can say she didn't blow up SR288 in Metroid 2, but she made up for that in Fusion
[2:59:52] <Calek> how else you find secrets
[2:59:55] <%BlueVanRoss> back where the cutscene was
[3:00:01] <ElenaManetta> i thought you kept more of an eye out for environment differences
[3:00:03] <+qwazzeon> @bugz_munny the baby. *mic drop*
[3:00:04] <olaksi> samus picks up high-explosives "idk what this is, ill keep it"
[3:00:11] <Explodincatz> bork
[3:00:11] <hollumdusk> Dark Eather was a weird dimentional rift, but it was still a planet with it's own species, and even an empire
[3:00:13] <bleugh> borf
[3:00:13] <Calamity2007> @scaryboisupreme Source?
[3:00:15] <%doc_ock_rokc> THE GIEF REQUIRES LOVE
[3:00:16] <+bugz_munny> Eeeeeever
[3:00:16] <%ShinobiPhoenix> oh that planet I DIDN'T blow up before, got to fix that
[3:00:18] <TioXyco> @Calamity2007 but then again, when you think about it, one less planet on the galay is a small price to pay to get rid of one big threat
[3:00:22] <SamHellbent> Woops
[3:00:22] <%Issun135> just a small one
[3:00:22] <+Grayhammatter> MIGHT?
[3:00:23] <%greasypete00> somewhat
[3:00:25] <%zarkazeon> is it back to water world now or does he need a few more upgrqdes?
[3:00:25] <akitanito> "might"
[3:00:28] <%TarikBot> World map version 2
[3:00:28] <Alzero83> You let out the Space Corona
[3:00:29] <SamHellbent> Welp, time to blow it up
[3:00:29] <%scaryboisupreme> @Calamity2007 the original translation lmao
[3:00:32] <+bugz_munny> I dont care what this game says, Other M never happened
[3:00:32] <%Issun135> planet is still here at least
[3:00:32] <fistynopunches> tbf it was a matter of time
[3:00:32] <majindusto> MIGHT OF?
[3:00:32] <@TheYellowcouch> eh it'll be fine
[3:00:33] <%Mr_Pylon> maybe a teeny tiny fucky wucky
[3:00:34] <+spawnzie> and the galaxy if you dont blow the planet
[3:00:35] <+DigiDom> YEP
[3:00:35] <+Akizea> get the exterminatus ready honestly
[3:00:36] <Saltmeisterr> @PatStaresAt remember that the door closed behind her
[3:00:37] <GenericSoda> look you can just blame it on the antagonist and call it a day
[3:00:37] <ChaoticDaKiller> Remember that time Samus accidentally fucked an entire planet?
[3:00:41] <+Akizea> planet is fucked
[3:00:42] <marvel877> Maybe
[3:00:42] <olaksi> killing the planet was the point
[3:00:43] <akitanito> you got the plasma beam
[3:00:44] <%watts121> Any excuse to nuke a planet eh Samus?
[3:00:44] <%Issun135> to get plasma beam lmao
[3:00:44] <ElenaManetta> you can afford to blow up a few planets. the universe has tons of them
[3:00:44] <%scaryboisupreme> The english localization fucked up the Fusion translation
[3:00:44] <DeeVee_TV> new gun
[3:00:45] <Blu_C> Get cool gun upgrade.
[3:00:46] <+bugz_munny> They cant make me acknowledge it happened
[3:00:46] <Calamity2007> @scaryboisupreme Okay good to know
[3:00:46] <%Ne1son> To get Plasma
[3:00:47] <%xbb1024> so that Samus can do war crimes
[3:00:48] <Make_me_mad> Gotta get the plasma beam
[3:00:49] <ape_hawk> you MAY have committed a tiny apocalypse
[3:00:49] <+Slattsquatch> Samus was never known for her subtle problem solving
[3:00:49] <Saltmeisterr> u got plasma beam :)
[3:00:50] <mr_mister0> to get power ups
[3:00:50] <+zoopbooploop> Honestly, genius way to level up the enemies in the world to match with Samus' increasing power
[3:00:51] <miabyte> you got a new beam
[3:00:52] <%solracc25> maybe
[3:00:52] <LunarRemix> AT this point you'd think they just nuke the entire planet right
[3:00:52] <%RealThiele> plasma is good
[3:00:52] <+DeepPix3l> To get cool power ups
[3:00:52] <marvel877> Lore
[3:00:54] <%JoshManVGH> So you could get a cool thing
[3:00:54] <%Issun135> plasma beam > this planet
[3:00:54] <%zettig> Whose more dangerous? The X, the Flood, or necromorphs?
[3:00:57] <%baronouroboros> I'm thinking this planet was already fooked
[3:00:57] <%peachy996> Planetary Genocide via Viral threat is a bit of a whoopsie
[3:01:02] <%scaryboisupreme> X
[3:01:03] <%ShinobiPhoenix> Samus is like the Xenomorphs in Alien, not allowed to touch Earth ot she's find a way to destroy it
[3:01:03] <%scaryboisupreme> Easy
[3:01:04] <%Piemono> Samus secretly loves killing worlds, she's like Freiza
[3:01:04] <%solracc25> Get new beam?
[3:01:06] <%RealThiele> plasma beam was powering the door
[3:01:09] <markdreizehn> Plasma beams are worth an entire planets ecosystem
[3:01:10] <%doc_ock_rokc> @zettig ...x
[3:01:10] <Louie_Salmon> Yeah, we do a little trolling. *Wipes entire planet of ecosystems from existence*
[3:01:13] <%Monkeyweed21> need that tasty plasma to watch Spirits Within
[3:01:13] <GenericSoda> @zettig couldn't the X just become both of the other ones
[3:01:17] <Calamity2007> @TioXyco Yeah a single X could more or less wipe out Galactic civilization on its own
[3:01:18] <Saltmeisterr> @zettig depends on which is space faring
[3:01:18] <fistynopunches> X
[3:01:19] <Psykoknight65> to be fair it's not like she willing opened it, it just kinds did when she walked up to the door
[3:01:19] <%Issun135> uh og
[3:01:20] <ChaoticDaKiller> Plaanet doomed but at least Samus got a cool Jetpack!
[3:01:20] <CrazyMedicine> i mean... the plasma beam tho
[3:01:20] <+NickHatesSnow> the planet only has her and raven anyways
[3:01:20] <olaksi> and she just looks like she's thinking what to have for dinner, damn
[3:01:21] <%captain_thickthighs> also lore enciorement
[3:01:24] <KnivesEve> maybe the X
[3:01:24] <haisho> noooooo
[3:01:24] <Asuterisuku> Also, Samus didn't destroy Zebes, Mother Brain did.
[3:01:25] <hassanico2> F
[3:01:25] <mr_mister0> The X literally cant die without a Metroid to eat them, so that
[3:01:27] <%Issun135> big bad
[3:01:27] <%ShinobiPhoenix> she wasn't born on Earth anyway, she has no attachment to blowing it up
[3:01:30] <%greasypete00> oh no the implications
[3:01:33] <%peachy996> The X are fully mobile and always multiplying so they are a giant threat
[3:01:35] <%RealThiele> ruh roh
[3:01:35] <Make_me_mad> Samus is the one the federation calls when they need a species wiped the fuck out of the universe.
[3:01:38] <%alcors_wisdom> samus can blow up a little planet as a treat
[3:01:38] <%JoshManVGH> Yeah... they are
[3:01:39] <Asuterisuku> Oh no Quiet Robe!
[3:01:40] <+eldritchhorrortwitchchat> :)
[3:01:41] <Onatamana> PROBLEMS
[3:01:41] <%scaryboisupreme> X just touch you and you both die and become X
[3:01:43] <Explodincatz> red means power
[3:01:45] <%Ynkubus_> its just a space gummy, what could go wrong?
[3:01:46] <%dekkitout> Oh no, Birb Fren
[3:01:46] <%ShinobiPhoenix> recycle the clock
[3:01:46] <Blu_C> This is going well.
[3:01:48] <ape_hawk> ZOMBO BIRD
[3:01:48] <+spawnzie> X can copy memories
[3:01:50] <Calamity2007> No not bird uncle
[3:01:51] <%RealThiele> OOPSY DOODLE
[3:01:53] <wqorst> beep boop

[3:03:01] <%TarikBot> Megafucked the whole ecosystem]
[3:03:01] <Warbot40> Planet's gotta go now
[3:03:01] <%Issun135> but more hp/ammo resources over all so thats a plus
[3:03:03] <+LCGOV> @TarikBot YES
[3:03:04] <%captain_thickthighs> xussy
[3:03:06] <+lordericter> XWHUSSY hfdashfkladjshks
[3:03:08] <+Dappercat> well, time to nuke it
[3:03:10] <DeeVee_TV> ADAM I FUCKED UP
[3:03:11] <azure_dunes> samus you fucked up big time - adam
[3:03:11] <SaltyAzteca> Adaaaaaaaaaaaaaam I did a thiiiiiiiiiiiiing
[3:03:13] <%ShinobiPhoenix> the small X are great for getting ammo and health though
[3:03:15] <akitanito> "you dun goof'd samus"
[3:03:15] <Asuterisuku> ADAM! How do we fix this?
[3:03:15] <tequilazaku> ggs animals, it was nice, not gonna escue any of you now, whopsie
[3:03:16] <%Issun135> also be on the look out for red X they give big resources
[3:03:16] <%scaryboisupreme> "Y-yeah it was totally Raven Beak"
[3:03:20] <@GeneralSCPatton> OOPS ALL X
[3:03:20] <+bugz_munny> "Good job, idiot"
[3:03:21] <%RealThiele> ADAM: oh fuck samus jeez
[3:03:21] <%LaughingCatt> oops
[3:03:23] <olaksi> yeeaaah, sure raven beak, he did it
[3:03:24] <haisho> oh so it wasn't you
[3:03:24] <%greasypete00> "did i do that?"
[3:03:25] <%tusk102> theres a reason x was considered more dangerous than metroids
[3:03:25] <GenericSoda> @scaryboisupreme LUL
[3:03:26] <+LCGOV> OOPS ALL X PARASITE
[3:03:26] <%blastyoboots> TOTALLY raven beak
[3:03:27] <%ShinobiPhoenix> yeah, it was totally that guy
[3:03:29] <+spawnzie> YEAH TOTALLY THAT GUY'S FAULT
[3:03:30] <tanarath> @dappercat time to atomize it
[3:03:32] <%Deft_Thought> Yup... Raven Beak...
[3:03:33] <%extradopeness> adam: "well lady ya done did it now"
[3:03:34] <markdreizehn> "HIS MOTIVES ARE A MYSTERY BUT HE SURE IS A COOL GUY LEAVING A COOL MESSAGE"
[3:03:34] <%MegadBlitz> "IT WAS RAVEN BEAK I SWEARS IT
[3:03:35] <CrazyMedicine> How could Raven beak do this?! LUL
[3:03:36] <%peachy996> "Umm yeah it was all Raven Beak"
[3:03:36] <AzureFlame98> I like how they completely overran the planet in the short time you opened the door
[3:03:36] <redwidow1358> I can't believe Raven Beak would do this
[3:03:41] <Blu_C> Wow, Adam sure is chill about the "killed another planet" thing.
[3:03:43] <%peachy996> "He opened the door"
[3:03:47] <+bugz_munny> HOW COULD RAVEN BEAK AHVE DONE THIS
[3:03:48] <tequilazaku> How could raven beak do this
[3:03:51] <%JoshManVGH> Look at Samus' track record. ANY planet or space station she has landed on as ended up beyond fucked.
[3:03:53] <%solracc25> wasn't your fault
[3:03:56] <GenericSoda> We're all tryign to find the guy that did this
[3:03:57] <TehMud> ITS NOT GREAT
[3:03:57] <Tham1k> Just suck all the x
[3:03:58] <%tusk102> its finnneee
[3:03:59] <Onatamana> So any planet that has X on it for even 2 seconds is fucked, unless ground zero is maybe in the arctic or something, then you have maybe 10 minutes before it finds some biomass.
[3:04:02] <%RealThiele> run awaaaaay
[3:04:04] <Alzero83> seriously?
[3:04:06] <%TheLemuroid> Just how many planets has Samus killed now?
[3:04:06] <olaksi> she should be arrested tbh
[3:04:07] <Louie_Salmon> Raven Beak is so hot, I bet his crow dick is huge Samus Aran
[3:04:11] <majindusto> We are totally  nuking this planet...Huh?
[3:04:12] <%doc_ock_rokc> @Blu_C When she hits 10 he gets a free planet they can destroy
[3:04:12] <%solracc25> Get back in the car samus
[3:04:23] <%peachy996> Shh no RB posting
[3:04:24] <hollumdusk> light Aether and Tallon IV are Still fine
[3:04:29] <jorniev> IS this that knightmare scenario from prey? or the THING ?
[3:04:30] <+LCGOV> @majindusto is that even a question
[3:04:35] <Calamity2007> @Onatamana It is essentially the alien from John Carpenter's the Thing except it can fly
[3:04:35] <%Issun135> psaDogchamp psaGiefrail
[3:04:36] <%solracc25> @majindusto when don't we?
[3:04:36] <%peachy996> But yeah Raven Beak is so cool
[3:04:39] <tequilazaku> @JoshManVGH Ok but also, she goes to them because they are fucked in some way already, its really a self fulfilling prophecy
[3:04:41] <notabrobro> @TheLemuroid Zebes, SR388, Phaaze, and Dark Aether
[3:04:42] <majindusto> Samus...GET THAT BANANA
[3:04:45] <%doc_ock_rokc> @jorniev yes
[3:04:46] <hollumdusk> same for most of the planets in Corruption and Hunters
[3:04:49] <+GalacticaPhanto> Samus get in the car, planets fucked and we can't let them know it was us- Adam
[3:04:54] <+Dappercat> @TheLemuroid i think any celestial object she has touched down on has been obliterated
[3:04:55] <%Issun135> this is the most anime samus has been
[3:04:55] <fairore> @jorniev yes but worse
[3:05:00] <GenericSoda> @Onatamana I think the only exception is if the only wildlife the X can access don't have the intelligence or capability to be used, they passed over possessing the Super Metroid animals in Fusion
[3:05:05] <xerioes> his is like if  a billion things were released at once
[3:05:08] <%tusk102> Raven Beaks dick is so big oh man gonna get some of that Chussy (chozo bussy)
[3:05:21] <+bugz_munny> Samus im gonna say some real heavy shit and you're gonna have to not react cuz the kids in the room
[3:05:23] <%scaryboisupreme> oh my god that scene is even funnier now that I beat the game
[3:05:24] <+bugz_munny> burn the planet
[3:05:28] <%JoshManVGH> @tequilazaku It's a vicious cycle. Whelp, time to throw another planet into It's nearby star!
[3:05:28] <%RealThiele> yea like the X on SR-388 had they been left alone would have never been able to escape
[3:05:29] <+bugz_munny> burn the planet kill raven beak
[3:05:37] <fistynopunches> tbf there were like 2 people on this planet
[3:05:40] <%ShinobiPhoenix> @TheLemuroid and Tallon IV
[3:05:41] <%peachy996> @GenericSoda I thought those animals were either special or contained?
[3:05:46] <%scaryboisupreme> Just the instant the X touch down you gotta blow up the planet
[3:05:49] <%Issun135> The X have been shown to be more intelligent than previously thought. depending on the host they absorb
[3:06:01] <%solracc25> This whole game is about how Samus lost the keys to her car
[3:06:02] <tanarath> @fistynopunches one of them was vorgil
[3:06:04] <GenericSoda> @peachy996 nah, Adam said that they weren't X hosts because they offered no benefit
[3:06:11] <Asuterisuku> @RealThiele And it's Samus' fault they escaped. Good job, Samus.
[3:06:12] <%ShinobiPhoenix> X are DEEPLY intelligent and use tactics
[3:06:13] <%JoshManVGH> @tusk102 Why is the -ussy layered!?
[3:06:14] <%scaryboisupreme> with the Flood and Necromorphs you can contain them to a degree. X aren't affected by most weapons outside of metroids
[3:06:15] <%RealThiele> their first food in fusion was a buncha nerds so that didnt help
[3:06:20] <fistynopunches> the other good bird was already dead anyway
[3:06:20] <+bugz_munny> X DEFINITELY need a purging
[3:06:22] <%Monkeyweed21> is Aether the only planet Samus HASNT blown up?
[3:06:27] <%ShinobiPhoenix> X are the worse version of Symbiote or Borg
[3:06:29] <%peachy996> @GenericSoda And yet they can fly a ship....Stupid X LUL
[3:06:33] <%MegadBlitz> @tusk102 where is it? go get it then
[3:06:38] <%razielhex> R-R-RELOAD
[3:06:39] <+bugz_munny> That shit cant exist
[3:06:41] <%ShinobiPhoenix> Aether wasn't asking for it hard enough
[3:06:42] <+bugz_munny> ever
[3:06:42] <+Slattsquatch> @Monkeyweed21 Tallon IV and most of the planets from Prime 3
[3:06:43] <Onatamana> At least with metroids, you can at least know whether or not the ships people are evacuating on are infested or not.
[3:06:45] <+GalacticaPhanto> Zebes wasn't her fault, Mother Brain did that shit
[3:06:47] <Psykoknight65> @asuterisuku not really,  she didn't willingly open that door it just kinda did
[3:06:54] <Asuterisuku> Aether, Talon IV, all the planets in Hunters and Prime 3...
[3:07:06] <GenericSoda> @peachy996 Having just beaten Dread, I can accept a handful of plot holes in this game, it's way more tidy than a bunch of other stuff I like
[3:07:10] <fistynopunches> man Tallon IV and Aether got off easy
[3:07:13] <Asuterisuku> @Psykoknight65 I was talking about off SR388 in Fusion.
[3:07:13] <hollumdusk> she didn't blow up most of the planets in Corruption, neither Tallon IV
[3:07:17] <%MegadBlitz> so in total thats HOW many planets
[3:07:23] <+GalacticaPhanto> Mother Brain was like "you didn't win!" and blew it up
[3:07:25] <%ShinobiPhoenix> and I don't mean worse like they are bad versions of that thing, I mean X are WAY more dangerous
[3:07:27] <%Issun135> there is enough of a thread for a metroid 6 but also perfectly fine ending at 5 and having a side story or different time period
[3:07:30] <%tusk102> what the fuck is federations about
[3:07:31] <%RealThiele> yea tallon 4 just had that crater pimple popped
[3:07:36] <%rilou501> Just beat the game before coming here. Fucking sick
[3:07:37] <fistynopunches> blew up Zebes SR388 though
[3:07:42] <Calamity2007> @Asuterisuku Actually only Dark Aether got destroyed
[3:07:43] <+bugz_munny> There's zero explanation for Kraid
[3:07:45] <olaksi> "she didn't blow up -most- of the planets" LUL
[3:07:50] <%peachy996> @GenericSoda I don't think the X thing is that big an issue, I just thought it was funny
[3:07:50] <%ShinobiPhoenix> Symbiotes WISH they could copy dna and powers of their host and bring back the dead
[3:07:53] <Asuterisuku> Mother Brain blew up Zebes.
[3:07:57] <Alzero83> Chozo raise Samus, Samus repays them by blowing up every planet with Chozo Ruins
[3:07:59] <CrazyMedicine> i wonder what will be the next thing she blow up? The entire federation station? LUL
[3:08:01] <Asuterisuku> ... Yes, I'm talking about planets that weren't destroyed.
[3:08:01] <@GeneralSCPatton> The most pants-shitting moment here is when you blast one of those swarms with the plasma beam, and they're ALL X. Imagine all the ants and gnats on Earth being X.
[3:08:04] <GenericSoda> @peachy996 yeah it's pretty funny atpCap
[3:08:09] <+Slattsquatch> At least 4, plus a planet's alternate dimension if you include Dark Aether
[3:08:21] <+McDerpus> all I can think about is that one episode of futurama where Fry goes to do his bucket list, and one of them is to destroy a planet, which turns out to be boring manual labor for most people
[3:08:23] <hollumdusk> we don't know how Kraid survive Zebes, but we know how he ended in ZDR
[3:08:26] <Calamity2007> @bugz_munny I like to imagine that it is one of the species and not the same Kraid itself. Remember the smaller Kraid right before the actual fight in Super?
[3:08:31] <%Issun135> Metroid 6 could also be samus going against the rogue federation faction
[3:08:35] <+DeepPix3l> TBF tons of aliens blow up their own planets. Hell the Luminoths blew up their planet in 2 dimensions
[3:08:38] <%Issun135> doubt it though
[3:08:38] <Onatamana> @hollumdusk Only one planet blown up in MP3, yeah, but does killing the phazon leviathans count as aborting a phazon planet to be in the womb?
[3:08:42] <Asuterisuku> Samus has saved more worlds than she's blown up.
[3:08:42] <%tusk102> @hollumdusk was it kraid or just the same species
[3:08:48] <+Grayhammatter> yellow
[3:08:54] <%solracc25> @bugz_munny There doesn't need to be. It's just another here we go again.
[3:08:55] <tequilazaku> shits fucked
[3:08:55] <%crimsonharvest> finally figured out the settings to watch 2 streams at once hey everybody
[3:08:55] <+bugz_munny> All the promo material doesnt refer to a species so we cant assume that
[3:08:55] <%ShinobiPhoenix> @Asuterisuku when planets you go fight on HAPPEN to keep getting blown up, people start to ask questions
[3:08:57] <%RealThiele> Kraid didnt survive zebes but i think it implies kraid is just like a battle monster made by the chozo
[3:09:09] <+bugz_munny> What?
[3:09:11] <fistynopunches> X augmentation
[3:09:14] <Onatamana> even the little bugs are X now
[3:09:20] <%watts121> love how fast the entire planet was infected
[3:09:20] <%cvp5127> oh no theyre digivolving
[3:09:20] <akitanito> that was not a winning strategy
[3:09:20] <+bugz_munny> This game loves its story but it has a huge hole
[3:09:21] <%peachy996> I feel like if the X had an extra half hour to stick around on the BSL Station in fusion they'd have figured out they can fly spaceships via using their hosts
[3:09:21] <ohno778> lol Kamala
[3:09:23] <%Issun135> oh yea those clouds of small enemies are also real good a restoring resources
[3:09:24] <%RealThiele> Girthy
[3:09:29] <hollumdusk> no, it is THE  Kraid, he and Samus recognize  each other, and the game still calls him Kraid
[3:09:30] <+bugz_munny> Kraid's kind of a big deal
[3:09:31] <Calamity2007> @Asuterisuku Indeed, the threats she faces are a danger to galactic society as a whole. The X, Phazeon, Metroids, all of them could have wiped out the galaxy
[3:09:34] <%solracc25> psaBig psaMenace psaMenace psaMenace
[3:09:36] <+Evendrag> They getting jacked up
[3:09:38] <%peachy996> It's incremental intelligence
[3:09:45] <%crimsonharvest> this is why nuke it from orbit is the standard option
[3:09:45] <%lumporr> SNIFF SNIFF SNIFF
[3:09:46] <+Grayhammatter> wow
[3:09:50] <devanmuse> oh hey, the EMMIs woke up
[3:09:50] <SaltyAzteca> GO AWAAAAAAY
[3:09:54] <%Piemono> hahaha
[3:09:54] <%Deft_Thought> Oh god
[3:09:55] <%NigelSchnauzerpug> The smartest robot ever created.
[3:09:57] <%RealThiele> LUL
[3:09:57] <+JonathLP> He could smell your fear
[3:10:04] <notabrobro> GET A LOAD OF THAT DOG
[3:10:07] <olaksi> samus flies off, planet blows "i just went to grab lunch i swear it wasn't me"
[3:10:10] <Asuterisuku> This one's a big old NOT YET.
[3:10:12] <$realm_forge> This is an environmental disaster on par with half of what BP does in a year
[3:10:13] <%ShinobiPhoenix> @hollumdusk you can't apply that logic, Ridley clones recognize Samus, as did Ridley X
[3:10:13] <+Grayhammatter> sick hiding pat
[3:10:14] <+luketrapwalker> That felt kinda gross somehow LUL
[3:10:19] <%twistedj3ster> Samus is rat
[3:10:22] <+Grayhammatter> time stop
[3:10:44] <%RealThiele> Samus needs her swim floaty
[3:10:46] <$Crusader_DLion> 1K ppl dag yo
[3:10:48] <%Issun135> bomb jumps in water are not allowed in this game outside this one specific set of inputs that speedrunners are using
[3:10:49] <%lumporr> bebebooboobebebeep
[3:10:54] <%solracc25> rats can't swim
[3:10:55] <+bugz_munny> There straight up is zero explanation for Kraid moving one planet to another
[3:11:02] <+bugz_munny> offically
[3:11:04] <%MugenSandan> I love how even all the basic health and missile pickups are gone, it's all X now
[3:11:11] <%Issun135> at least before gravity suit
[3:11:12] <Make_me_mad> I feel like memory is just genetic in the metroid universe.
[3:11:17] <+gustavozxd> there kinda is
[3:11:18] <%crimsonharvest> there's also no explanation for the fuckin screw attack moving from planet to planet so whatever
[3:11:18] <+s1eepyshiba> yeah I was confused about that too
[3:11:19] <GenericSoda> the explanation is "shut up"
[3:11:19] <%lumporr> bebebebeboobooboop
[3:11:21] <%Piemono> The real estate market was great here
[3:11:23] <$Jaxnos> i appreciate how cute and colorful they made the deadliest parasite in this galaxy
[3:11:25] <DeeVee_TV> its kraid's brother kraig
[3:11:26] <%ShinobiPhoenix> why do people automatically think it's the same Kraid
[3:11:28] <ammobasket> Kraid just wants a change of scenery
[3:11:30] <Treasure_Vault> Kraid doesn't get it either
[3:11:30] <hollumdusk> Well, thing is, se know where Clone Ridley came from, while Kraid we just know he was captured by the Chozo
[3:11:32] <+supersonic21> people are saying thats either the orginal kraid or a clone
[3:11:32] <+bugz_munny> just seems weird for a game so obsessed with its lore
[3:11:35] <%Bane_Kaikyo> @MugenSandan naw those still exsist
[3:11:38] <+GalacticaPhanto> @bugz_munny he survived Super, probably got caught by Raven Beak and kept in ZDR. bam
[3:11:39] <shillelaghrod> @ShinobiPhoenix I guess it
[3:11:42] <Onatamana> The fact that the X were even contained on this planet at all ever is a miracle. Raven Beak must've had to do some bullshit to solve that problem.
[3:11:43] <%ShinobiPhoenix> Super and such make it very clear that Ridley and Kraid were ATOMIZED
[3:11:43] <%lumporr> @Jaxnos i mean that's accurate to real life
[3:11:46] <+gustavozxd> you unlock an image of the chozo from this planet capturing him
[3:11:48] <%solracc25> Punished Kraid
[3:11:49] <shillelaghrod> 's because kraid seems pissed when he sees samus
[3:11:49] <+DeepPix3l> It feels like Nintendo went "Put Kraid or Ridley in it." And they had to find a spot to put him.
[3:11:50] <%SaiyanShoto> Kraid just keeps popping up in every Metroid game
[3:11:53] <SaltyAzteca> ya
[3:11:55] <shillelaghrod> but maybe he's pissed at everything
[3:11:56] <%TarikBot> Youve Been Xed
[3:11:56] <LunarRemix> The planet's got to go now
[3:11:58] <SaltyAzteca> X spread super fast
[3:11:58] <+bugz_munny> @GalacticaPhanto show me where it says that
[3:11:59] <%scaryboisupreme> oh yeah the X have just completely taken over
[3:12:00] <moonmeh> EVERYTHING IS X
[3:12:00] <Saltmeisterr> pat
[3:12:00] <+Grayhammatter> yeo
[3:12:01] <%cvp5127> burn it all down
[3:12:01] <%ShinobiPhoenix> Ridley only knows Samus through genetic memory
[3:12:02] <%Teyaric> so Raven beak wanted to use the Metroids and X for Bird Supremacy, right? but why would releasing the X help that? he just guaranteed everything on the planet is dead.
[3:12:03] <%MidnightBurst12> errybody
[3:12:05] <Slim_Lipid> there were multiple Kraus in Metroid 1 LUL motherfucker isn't a dude he's a generic enemy
[3:12:06] <$Jaxnos> as they say: "X gonna give it to ya"
[3:12:08] <%doc_ock_rokc> I think its cool cold dmage is more then a thing now that samus has metroid DNA
[3:12:08] <%tusk102> i mean its very possible its just the same species
[3:12:10] <Saltmeisterr> when we said planet's fucked
[3:12:17] <GenericSoda> @DeepPix3l honestly given how fucked up Ridley's appearance in Samus Returns was, I'm fine with it being Kraid
[3:12:17] <%Issun135> it took the X maybe like all of an hour to get the planet
[3:12:19] <+JustToWatch> Samus is so lucky she can eat X, they look like they taste like giant gummi bears
[3:12:21] <olaksi> it really is like if The Thing landed on a populated area
[3:12:23] <akitanito> ice bad
[3:12:24] <%Deft_Thought> As the saying goes: X gon give it to yah
[3:12:25] <%solracc25> yup
[3:12:25] <hollumdusk> I mean, we never questioned how Kraid, Ridley and Morher Brain suevived in Metroid 1
[3:12:27] <devanmuse> That quarantine door was open for what? 5 minutes?
[3:12:27] <Saltmeisterr> we REALLY mean PLANET'S FUCK
[3:12:29] <+ReallyBigRocks> too cold
[3:12:29] <%Bane_Kaikyo> I've never seen that
[3:12:30] <+gustavozxd> @bugz_munny there's an image you unlock in the gallery that shows them capturing kraid
[3:12:31] <SaltyAzteca> Metroid hate ice
[3:12:33] <redwidow1358> He didn't want to use the X, his race was wiped out by them @teyaric
[3:12:35] <+bugz_munny> They at least have the decency to hand-wave Ridley, Kraid they dont give a fuck
[3:12:35] <%solracc25> All the planet
[3:12:35] <Calamity2007> This is why not a single X can be allowed to live
[3:12:37] <majindusto> GET FUCKED
[3:12:42] <+zoopbooploop> IT SURE DOES
[3:12:44] <+Grayhammatter> it's cold
[3:12:48] <%RealThiele> GET FROZONED
[3:12:48] <Calamity2007> *can't
[3:12:48] <Onatamana> guess we know where the ice upgrade is in this game
[3:12:51] <%tusk102> @hollumdusk didnt riple come back a cyborg
[3:12:51] <+bugz_munny> @gustavozxd Which makes no sense because he shouldnt be there
[3:13:00] <shillelaghrod> no kraid theme in this game is pure heresy
[3:13:01] <%scaryboisupreme> Nah the concept art you unlock at the end explains why Kraid is there
[3:13:01] <seaechiowai> good parry
[3:13:05] <%doc_ock_rokc> I wonder what X parasites taste like
[3:13:06] <GenericSoda> Even a single X Parasite is basically the worst possible biohazard
[3:13:10] <+bugz_munny> No it doesnt
[3:13:17] <%ShinobiPhoenix> @Teyaric If you infuse your soldiers to also be part Metroid, which is proven possible, you can use X to kill everyrhing and then eat the X
[3:13:18] <Saltmeisterr> @scaryboisupreme No it doesn't lol
[3:13:19] <+bugz_munny> because he shouldnt be on the planet
[3:13:26] <%TheWinged7> giant enemy crab
[3:13:27] <Onatamana> too big to parry
[3:13:29] <%Piemono> gotta slide under
[3:13:29] <%zarkazeon> slide
[3:13:31] <majindusto> BEMMI IS A BITCH
[3:13:31] <+Evendrag> someone on the enemy design team must really love thumper
[3:13:34] <akitanito> shoot the crotch
[3:13:39] <+DeepPix3l> Could you imagine if X Parasites could get onto Phaaze?
[3:13:39] <%Agami23> theres tons of reasons kraid could be on the planet
[3:13:39] <Onatamana> gotta shoot it in it's ass (face)
[3:13:40] <Asuterisuku> There's a coming fight that's really cool.
[3:13:42] <%solracc25> big boi
[3:13:43] <+toastybites> yum red lobster
[3:13:44] <hollumdusk> ridley was fully recovered by Super, and Kraid just came back as if nothing hapoened
[3:13:46] <%RealThiele> the ol dick shot
[3:13:47] <shillelaghrod> @Evendrag and borderlands
[3:13:47] <Asuterisuku> ~~Also this is GEMMI~~
[3:13:48] <+JustToWatch> shoot the crussy
[3:13:49] <%scaryboisupreme> what's so hard to understand about it lmao
[3:13:53] <+Grayhammatter> giant enemy crab
[3:13:53] <Kaji04> i think you'd do more damage if you just rapid fire it
[3:13:55] <%Teyaric> and this is a planet of Quiet Robes people so Beak doesn't care if all the infidels get vored huh
[3:13:56] <Calamity2007> @shillelaghrod It plays his theme, it is just a different take on it
[3:13:58] <+gustavozxd> it's just a side boss coming back who cares LUL
[3:14:02] <Explodincatz> just walk around him
[3:14:08] <ammobasket> it was THREE! In a trenchcoat!
[3:14:09] <+bugz_munny> Ridley has all sorts of explanations, kraid is just ?????
[3:14:11] <%doc_ock_rokc> So everything on this planet is now Xussy
[3:14:14] <%solracc25> gummi x
[3:14:14] <GenericSoda> @DeepPix3l ok so wait, would the phazon overtake them, I've forgotten if Phazon is organic and/or sentient
[3:14:14] <majindusto> BLIND
[3:14:17] <+Grayhammatter> LYL
[3:14:18] <%Issun135> ey a red one spawned. i will say those red X are wayy more common in this game than in fusion
[3:14:19] <+bugz_munny> "HES HERE! CLAP!"
[3:14:19] <+Grayhammatter> LUL
[3:14:22] <+Evendrag> @shillelaghrod you mean spiderants, yeah i can see it
[3:14:24] <+zoopbooploop> b l i n d
[3:14:29] <moonmeh> LUL
[3:14:30] <%crimsonharvest> it sucks, in super you could usually get a short hop off those
[3:14:30] <%tusk102> it could just be  clone of kraid or the same species since it never says their name
[3:14:30] <%scaryboisupreme> Ridley was fully recovered in Super despite Samus handing his ass to him like 5 minutes ago in Samus Returns
[3:14:35] <+toastybites> ground lies
[3:14:39] <%Bane_Kaikyo> Troll floor
[3:14:40] <%solracc25> nope
[3:14:42] <%ShinobiPhoenix> there are LITERALLY babies Kraids in Metroid 3
[3:14:43] <%ErikFeral> Ball BaBombos
[3:14:44] <%Andrizzleton> Andrizzleton subscribed at Tier 1. They've subscribed for 16 months! Where da hood where da hood where da hood at?
[3:14:44] <@GeneralSCPatton> Pretty sure that X trump the Flood with infiltration and adaptability
[3:14:45] <dan_g_v> need time stop
[3:14:46] <shillelaghrod> @Calamity2007 sorry, I meant Kraid's Theme from Zero Mission or the original. The actual area is called Kraid for some reason so the song is technically Kraid's theme.
[3:14:48] <+bugz_munny> Ridley's got mad regen canon
[3:14:49] <Calamity2007> @doc_ock_rokc Pretty much, this is why the X were such a threat.
[3:14:53] <Make_me_mad> @Teyaric Quiet Robe actually says that ZDR is the Mawkin homeworld.
[3:14:54] <Onjani> S
[3:14:57] <%ErikFeral> It's the Screwattack symbol
[3:14:58] <%scaryboisupreme> Not anymore
[3:14:59] <%RealThiele> BIG HINT
[3:15:00] <SaltyAzteca> POUR ONE OUT LADS
[3:15:01] <%scaryboisupreme> Ridley's space dust
[3:15:03] <$Jaxnos> i would like to point out that Nintendo's metroid dread site says "a giant monster that appears to be Kraid"
[3:15:10] <$Jaxnos> as in it might not be
[3:15:13] <+Grayhammatter> man, i love the skip here
[3:15:14] <Asuterisuku> That missile is also a big ol' NOT YET.
[3:15:15] <GenericSoda> oh yeah Ridley just fuckin chomps a bunch of peopel and recovers from near death in the manga
[3:15:19] <%tusk102> @scaryboisupreme canonically ridley can regenerate through eating
[3:15:20] <+s1eepyshiba> dumbest new ability
[3:15:20] <+gustavozxd> @bugz_munny Just because there's an offhand explanation doesn't mean Ridley isn't around for the exact same reason
[3:15:20] <+DeepPix3l> @GenericSoda It's a living planet. So presumably, if the lifeforms on Phaaze couldn't adapt in time, the entire planet would become one big X Parasite
[3:15:22] <+bugz_munny> well yeah you kill his remains in X
[3:15:24] <%scaryboisupreme> this is the most pointless upgrade ever
[3:15:24] <%solracc25> Here you can soon sequence break something cool
[3:15:26] <%Andrizzleton> smh
[3:15:29] <p3niletrauma> Samnic the Hedgemas
[3:15:29] <%Issun135> screw attack is later
[3:15:29] <%Piemono> they're not the same
[3:15:29] <+Evendrag> kraids son, minikraid, who grew up
[3:15:29] <Kaji04> that aint it chief
[3:15:31] <Calamity2007> @bugz_munny And cybernetics if even that fails
[3:15:32] <+Grayhammatter> haha, screw attack
[3:15:32] <%dekkitout> Speen
[3:15:33] <azure_dunes> that's cause it's not lol
[3:15:34] <%doc_ock_rokc> NO YET
[3:15:34] <scarman125> screw attack is later
[3:15:34] <%greasypete00> it isnt
[3:15:35] <+lordericter> that's not screw attack is why
[3:15:35] <ChaoticDaKiller> this isn't the screw attack
[3:15:36] <shillelaghrod> @Jaxnos I think they just meant "is this kraid? or is this an X? play to find out mooooore"
[3:15:36] <%crimsonharvest> i fuckin hated getting this tbh
[3:15:38] <DeeVee_TV> he doesnt know PepeLaugh
[3:15:39] <hollumdusk> and the in game map calls his Boss icon Kraid, by name
[3:15:39] <+D00msDayDan> it's not the screw attack yet
[3:15:39] <%Andrizzleton> not a real metroid fan atpCap
[3:15:40] <Saltmeisterr> cuz its not
[3:15:41] <+CherteuseKapibara> lol did they copyright it?
[3:15:42] <%scaryboisupreme> @tusk102 it's hard to eat when you don't exist anymore
[3:15:44] <superchunk121> Thats cause it aint silly
[3:15:45] <majindusto> It isn't  ScrewAttack
[3:15:45] <%solracc25> not yet
[3:15:46] <+SolidusRex> That ain't the Screwattack
[3:15:46] <+s1eepyshiba> just a double jump
[3:15:47] <marvel877> You're confusing it with Space Jump, Pat.
[3:15:47] <SaltyAzteca> Oh its a double jump?
[3:15:49] <Asuterisuku> It's not the High Jump either.
[3:15:51] <%RealThiele> also gravity suit shoutout
[3:15:53] <wqorst> great value Space Jump
[3:15:55] <%tusk102> @scaryboisupreme indeed
[3:15:55] <seaechiowai> there is screw attack and this isn't it
[3:15:57] <%ShinobiPhoenix> @bugz_munny can't be that "mad" he was cyborg while his body healed from Metroid 1 all the way until Metroid 3, which is 5 games
[3:15:59] <%twistedj3ster> Your jump now sucks for a while
[3:16:02] <+lordericter> its not a great jump
[3:16:03] <+bugz_munny> Yeah theres a few logs in Prime explaining Ridley's morphology
[3:16:04] <Calamity2007> single space jump
[3:16:04] <Explodincatz> oh god its just as bad as in Super
[3:16:05] <@OfficioPrefectusCorgi> Thats not Screwatck
[3:16:08] <+s1eepyshiba> that's rendered completely useless by space jump later!
[3:16:08] <+gustavozxd> works similar to the space chump
[3:16:11] <%Issun135> the floating lights, jump on them
[3:16:12] <%scaryboisupreme> You can double jump in water
[3:16:13] <%tusk102> thats not screw attack
[3:16:13] <%ShinobiPhoenix> sorry, 6 games
[3:16:15] <%greasypete00> you cant gain height in the water yet
[3:16:19] <notabrobro> read the tooltip
[3:16:20] <%scaryboisupreme> Forward wise
[3:16:23] <%Nomenanza> just double jump
[3:16:25] <%ShinobiPhoenix> sorry, 4 games
[3:16:26] <+megaman_sentinel> no one reads
[3:16:28] <+Rekinsinn> you can make the jump in the water
[3:16:29] <%scaryboisupreme> you can't gain any height yet tho
[3:16:31] <marvel877> PAT
[3:16:32] <%solracc25> nope that was correct pat
[3:16:32] <%ShinobiPhoenix> no, 5 games
[3:16:33] <Onatamana> only a double jump, not a true space jump
[3:16:33] <shillelaghrod> read the description :(
[3:16:33] <scarman125> reading is for chumps
[3:16:34] <%notsoy> does it get some horizontal extension?
[3:16:37] <+Grayhammatter> just double jump 4Head
[3:16:39] <shillelaghrod> it's always getting ignored
[3:16:39] <Calamity2007> @s1eepyshiba I feel the timming is much more lenient here
[3:16:45] <Asuterisuku> It's really just a double jump.
[3:16:47] <akitanito> just go back the way you came from
[3:16:48] <seaechiowai> psaBlind psaBlind psaBlind
[3:16:49] <%ShinobiPhoenix> all 4 Primes and 2
[3:16:51] <%crimsonharvest> the text explained that underwater it cant gain height, only range
[3:16:53] <%tusk102> @PatStaresAt just double jump, not screw attack
[3:16:53] <hollumdusk> guys, seriouslu, check the map, the game already calls him Kraid, no funny names, like "creature" Or, prissoner.
[3:16:53] <%scaryboisupreme> Pat you just got double jump
[3:16:53] <%greasypete00> jump across
[3:16:56] <Tham1k> Why can't metroid swim
[3:16:57] <%Mr_Pylon> use your new thing
[3:16:57] <%Piemono> You can double jump
[3:16:58] <GenericSoda> I believe in you
[3:16:58] <%JoshManVGH> Multijump across
[3:16:58] <Finaldragoon> illiterate
[3:16:59] <majindusto> Double  Jump you fool
[3:16:59] <scarman125> I actually hate that you can't double jump off of a neutral jump in this game.
[3:17:03] <%Bane_Kaikyo> what the fuck is Pat doing?
[3:17:04] <%doc_ock_rokc> Hey does samus curl into a ball forwards or backwards
[3:17:04] <superchunk121> U literally got a double jump
[3:17:06] <+gustavozxd> atpCap atpCap atpCap atpCap atpCap atpCap atpCap
[3:17:07] <%solracc25> if only he read the description
[3:17:08] <CaptainBright> ............just double jump
[3:17:08] <%blankwaffle> that's a visual to time your jump
[3:17:09] <%Issun135> time your jumps with the floating balls
[3:17:12] <+zoopbooploop> why can't metroid jump
[3:17:15] <$Jaxnos> pat having a mild aneurysm
[3:17:18] <%RealThiele> professional gamer
[3:17:18] <%twistedj3ster> IT LIED
[3:17:20] <%scaryboisupreme> No you can't gain height
[3:17:20] <Asuterisuku> You can't GAIN height.
[3:17:20] <+bugz_munny> Are people still debating if it's really Kraid?
[3:17:23] <%scaryboisupreme> you can keep your current one
[3:17:24] <+zuzuxiv> you cant gain -height-
[3:17:24] <superchunk121> U can keep doing it
[3:17:26] <wqorst> is he doing a bit?
[3:17:26] <+bugz_munny> Because it is
[3:17:26] <+Slattsquatch> You can't gain HEIGHT
[3:17:28] <Asuterisuku> Maintaining height is another story.
[3:17:29] <olaksi> it said height, not distance
[3:17:30] <Saltmeisterr> not distance pat
[3:17:31] <+Rekinsinn> right which is why you optimize for distance, not height
[3:17:31] <superchunk121> It has a rythmn
[3:17:31] <GenericSoda> you gotta wait a little bit
[3:17:32] <shillelaghrod> @scarman125 It literally hasn't been that way in any metroid game. Except AM2R iirc which threw me off
[3:17:32] <majindusto> Time it better
[3:17:35] <%ForlornCarton> delay the second jump
[3:17:35] <%Mr_Pylon> jump betterer
[3:17:35] <%TheWinged7> its that cuphead reviewer time
[3:17:35] <Psykoknight65> you gotta time it right
[3:17:36] <Onatamana> you cannot gain HEIGHT in water. It said nothing about HORIZONTAL distance
[3:17:38] <%ShinobiPhoenix> people think about Kraid's name the way people apparently get mad at a name becoming a Title, liek Thor
[3:17:40] <%solracc25> horizontal
[3:17:40] <@OfficioPrefectusCorgi> cant gain hight in water
[3:17:40] <+Rekinsinn> you can drop more than you think can jump later
[3:17:40] <%watts121> You don't need to gain height just maintain it
[3:17:41] <+trizetacannon44> You can use it more than once!
[3:17:43] <MartyFun11> You can't jump higher than you started, but you can jump up to where you started
[3:17:45] <$ArcanumArcanum> you can't go higher than your first jump apex
[3:17:46] <%JoshManVGH> Can't gain height past your original jump height but you can maintain that height across gaps
[3:17:47] <hairtoday> you can't gain height over the first jump
[3:17:53] <%scaryboisupreme> That would make Dave Jaffe's head explode
[3:17:54] <%greasypete00> very finnicky
[3:17:54] <shillelaghrod> @trizetacannon44 You can't actually
[3:17:58] <+gustavozxd> jump requires timing, dumb
[3:18:04] <+bugz_munny> underwater movement makes that weird as a first tutorial spot
[3:18:05] <@GeneralSCPatton> You can still get distance
[3:18:06] <%doc_ock_rokc> Its castlevania double jump
[3:18:14] <majindusto> David Jaffe enigmaKEK
[3:18:22] <%Issun135> bruh those floating lights tell you exactly when to jump when samus is covering one
[3:18:30] <+bugz_munny> Lol Jaffe got EMMI'd
[3:18:34] <+Grayhammatter> you... did it
[3:18:35] <GenericSoda> SourPls
[3:18:38] <%ShinobiPhoenix> two Metroid games have had more than 1 Kraid and one had Baby Kraids, but we really want to believe they needed to move a Kraid that was ATOMIZED in canon
[3:18:40] <+Grayhammatter> MASH GOD
[3:18:48] <+bugz_munny> ISNT THIS FIGHT AWESOME
[3:18:51] <%solracc25> oops
[3:18:54] <%tusk102> pats mash ability is always insane to me
[3:18:56] <akitanito> no cutscene already
[3:18:56] <%ShinobiPhoenix> in stead of just growing a new one and then having to contain it
[3:18:57] <%doc_ock_rokc> YOU THOUGHT HE WAS A BOSS NO HE WAS A REGULAR ENEMY
[3:19:02] <%Issun135> big mash
[3:19:02] <+s1eepyshiba> was I the only one frustrated by the slow missle fire rate
[3:19:04] <%Piemono> Game not designed for crack hands
[3:19:05] <azure_dunes> SMOKED
[3:19:05] <%solracc25> molten
[3:19:11] <Neo_Kaiser> Was that a perfect?
[3:19:11] <%scaryboisupreme> Ridley came back from exploding multiple times but somehow it's outrageous that Kraid can come back
[3:19:11] <%Issun135> sajamMash sajamMash sajamMash sajamMash sajamMash
[3:19:11] <majindusto> Yes it is Awesome
[3:19:13] <Onatamana> PERFECT
[3:19:14] <Admiral_PopnFresh> RIP AND TEAR
[3:19:14] <%Agami23> god damn that was fast
[3:19:15] <%scaryboisupreme> ??????
[3:19:15] <+Slattsquatch> TURBO MODE
[3:19:15] <%JoshManVGH> Eat it
[3:19:16] <+gustavozxd> @shinobiphoenix I don't think canon matters that much in this franchise dude LUL
[3:19:20] <+D00msDayDan> wow i didn't know you can just shoot them i always used missiles
[3:19:21] <%RealThiele> K O
[3:19:21] <+Grayhammatter> fucking smoked that Xbird
[3:19:23] <Asuterisuku> Actually though, how to mash so fast?
[3:19:24] <+harrisboe> @shinobiphoenix also if you didn’t notice, he shoots baby kraid fetuses at you in this game
[3:19:25] <%solracc25> broken fingers
[3:19:25] <seaechiowai> f a t a l i t y
[3:19:26] <GenericSoda> @Issun135 sajamMash sajamMash sajamMash sajamMash sajamMash
[3:19:27] <+bugz_munny> so awesome they keep making you do it
[3:19:27] <%TarikBot> What do the different colours of X mean? Do they refill different stuff?
[3:19:28] <+bugz_munny> again
[3:19:30] <+bugz_munny> and again
[3:19:35] <Treasure_Vault> Kraid is too stupid to die
[3:19:35] <+bugz_munny> aaaaaaand again
[3:19:38] <+ReallyBigRocks> Pat has a gift for push button
[3:19:41] <redwidow1358> Ridley is a generic freak who canonically has regeneration abilities and has made a robot clone of himself. Kraid just exists.
[3:19:43] <GenericSoda> @TarikBot green is missiles, yellow is health, red is both
[3:19:43] <%doc_ock_rokc> Pat I didn't think you could serve button mash for thanksgiving!
[3:19:43] <stormhawk9891> Wow just fuck using missiles when you got a fire rate like that
[3:19:47] <+Rekinsinn> @doc_ock_rokc technically speaking an icon appears in the room you faught him like it does for bosses
[3:19:52] <@GeneralSCPatton> PERFECT. CAN NOT STOP THIS MAN! psaDab
[3:19:54] <%ShinobiPhoenix> @gustavozxd a series with a very long running still connecting and accurate canon, yes it does.
[3:19:56] <Asuterisuku> That grapple block's a not yet.
[3:19:57] <%scaryboisupreme> It's a video game
[3:19:58] <%Agami23> pat, your mashing skills break this game
[3:20:00] <shillelaghrod> @TarikBot yeah, just like in Fusion. Green X are ammo IIRC, Yellow are health, purple are max refills? and red just give you lots of everything
[3:20:03] <+gustavozxd> star wars ruined media with this whole shit being canon or not even though it never matters to any of the stories, the good ones at least
[3:20:06] <%solracc25> Anyone else here kill Kraid the "other way"?
[3:20:06] <%blankwaffle> can't you do more than 1 double jump?
[3:20:12] <%JoshManVGH> @tarikbot Yep! Yello health, green ammo, red both, and I think purple is full heal?
[3:20:13] <Onatamana> At this point, I half expect there to be a boss fight against about a dozen Ridley clones at various stages of development.
[3:20:14] <hollumdusk> Very sure that "baby" Kraid, was always referred as "fake" Kraid. I am willing to buy the clone theory, but that doesn't explain who clone him and why
[3:20:14] <%ShinobiPhoenix> but people are being weird about not getting it, it's not hard to think about
[3:20:16] <%greasypete00> you can parry on the magnet things btw
[3:20:18] <Calamity2007> @TarikBot I believe so, like one is health, one is ammo, and red is like both
[3:20:18] <%scaryboisupreme> Kraids still alive cause it's good for a video game boss fight
[3:20:25] <shillelaghrod> @gustavozxd that's a hot ass take. "canon doesn't matter in a good story"
[3:20:28] <marvel877> You cant' get that yet, Pat.
[3:20:28] <%tusk102> what does absorbing the x's do in game
[3:20:30] <+Grayhammatter> ice beam? no?
[3:20:34] <+zoopbooploop> Nah, you just gotta be fast
[3:20:35] <wqorst> samus is allergic to ice beam, sorry
[3:20:36] <Tham1k> ICE BEAM!
[3:20:37] <+s1eepyshiba> @blankwaffle new ability in between spacejump
[3:20:37] <hollumdusk> he surviving Zebes leave less questions as to who clone him
[3:20:38] <stormhawk9891> It's possible to get that now but you need to be fast
[3:20:39] <+bugz_munny> @scaryboisupreme Ill accept this answer over any lore answer
[3:20:40] <+zoopbooploop> and not grab the ledge
[3:20:41] <%TarikBot> @TarikBot @GenericSoda thank you!
[3:20:41] <%scaryboisupreme> Ice punch
[3:20:44] <LordOfThePoultry> LUL
[3:20:47] <+bugz_munny> Because the game certainly doesnt give one
[3:20:47] <+gustavozxd> @shinobiphoenix it's a side boss that shows up once and doesn't even come up in dialogue
[3:20:50] <%twistedj3ster> Spin Boost is so bad!
[3:20:51] <akitanito> getting juggled by death lol
[3:20:52] <%solracc25> you can taste it
[3:20:53] <GenericSoda> @TarikBot SeemsGood
[3:20:54] <%ShinobiPhoenix> @Onatamana the Federation most certainly has Ridley DNA somewhere else
[3:20:57] <+Grayhammatter> don't grab the ledge pat
[3:21:07] <p3niletrauma> cool platforming tech
[3:21:07] <majindusto> BEMMI TIME
[3:21:07] <Asuterisuku> Uh oh
[3:21:08] <Psykoknight65> @twistedj3ster no its just pat
[3:21:10] <%Issun135> ded
[3:21:12] <+gustavozxd> @shillelaghrod the fact that palatine had a reconstruction center doesn't matter in any of the 9+ star wars movies
[3:21:12] <+Evendrag> get to the central unit
[3:21:16] <Admiral_PopnFresh> Stabby
[3:21:16] <GenericSoda> oh yeah the timing is fucked up underwater
[3:21:17] <Asuterisuku> Water makes the timing way harder.
[3:21:21] <+harrisboe> Spoiler stuff suggests how he may have gotten here
[3:21:22] <%tusk102> you. did it
[3:21:23] <%TheWinged7> mortis
[3:21:23] <%ShinobiPhoenix> @Onatamana Other M is Canon and so is Fusion, os they have had Ridley DNA in multiple places being worked on
[3:21:26] <akitanito> why doesn't it just freeze you with beam
[3:21:31] <thatdudenamedlogan> Metroid: We're Not Fucking Around
[3:21:32] <Make_me_mad> @hollumdusk Raven Beak and his boys probably cloned a Kraid, because if memories are genetically stored, they could interrogate him to find out what the fuck happened to all the metroids.
[3:21:37] <%scaryboisupreme> But like, metroid zero mission was like no kraid, ridley, and MB were just critically damaged in their fights despite their sprites exploding
[3:21:41] <%solracc25> timing is different
[3:21:45] <%trackles_64> Are you finishing tonite pat?
[3:21:47] <%dekkitout> @gustavozxd No, but it mattered in a pre disney stroy called Dark Empire...
[3:21:47] <%twistedj3ster> @Psykoknight65 Nah, I had trouble with it too, it feels awful to use
[3:21:50] <Asuterisuku> No break for you.
[3:21:50] <+megaman_sentinel> u can dash after double jump
[3:21:54] <GenericSoda> LUL
[3:21:54] <%tusk102> jesus christ
[3:22:00] <Tham1k> Gaming
[3:22:02] <shillelaghrod> @gustavozxd I fuckin know. I'm not defending the shitshow that was the new trilogy, maybe I misunderstood.
[3:22:02] <%RealThiele> get popsicled
[3:22:03] <+Grayhammatter> LUL
[3:22:03] <GenericSoda> that happened to me earlier, I got pissed
[3:22:07] <LordOfThePoultry> LUL
[3:22:09] <+gustavozxd> @dekkitout and so my point stands
[3:22:10] <shillelaghrod> PARRY GOD
[3:22:12] <%NigelSchnauzerpug> @gustavozxd Well, it matters because now we know he had a reconstruction center. Aren't you happier now knowing that?
[3:22:13] <Asuterisuku> Godlike
[3:22:15] <Kaji04> kaji04Pog
[3:22:16] <%ShinobiPhoenix> pat is getting better
[3:22:16] <+zoopbooploop> Yeah, this is the WORST emmi
[3:22:16] <%Seyren1986> you're better at parrying than I am
[3:22:16] <DeeVee_TV> CERTIFIED GAMER
[3:22:17] <+Slattsquatch> THE DOUBLE
[3:22:17] <%doc_ock_rokc> STRANGER DANGER
[3:22:19] <akitanito> too bad freeze damage still accumulates
[3:22:19] <TrollKing96> E.M.M.I.U.S.S.Y.
[3:22:20] <@GeneralSCPatton> Not the icy wombo combo!
[3:22:21] <%tusk102> jesus fuckin christ that freeze
[3:22:21] <Vivirmos> Fuckin 3/3
[3:22:23] <%Bane_Kaikyo> WOO GO PAT GO!!
[3:22:24] <+wizard_of_diamonds> Its insane how the EMMI are so much more dangerous than anything but there's so many of them
[3:22:27] <wqorst> more parries than I got all game, damn
[3:22:29] <Calamity2007> This EMMI is the worse one
[3:22:31] <+s1eepyshiba> I felt like purple emmi was the worst tnh
[3:22:34] <Onatamana> @ShinobiPhoenix throw in some Ridley robots and a Ridley AI controlling the level too.
[3:22:35] <%solracc25> frozenSam
[3:22:36] <GenericSoda> atpCap
[3:22:38] <+harrisboe> According to the Metroid wiki, he may have been captured during Super Metroid, between defeating him and the planet blowing up
[3:22:38] <wibbwobbler> Noice
[3:22:45] <+Grayhammatter> strucken
[3:22:46] <akitanito> zero suit pat when
[3:22:48] <GenericSoda> @s1eepyshiba that thing is a son of a bitch
[3:22:51] <%greasypete00> psaDogchamp psaDogchamp psaDogchamp
[3:22:58] <%tusk102> i have seen nothing but hate for purple emmi
[3:22:59] <%crimsonharvest> at first i didnt want to replay this, but i saw some easy sequence breaks that make me want to see how it flows with them
[3:23:01] <%scaryboisupreme> no the art at the end shows RB and his boys kidnapping Kraid
[3:23:06] <%ShinobiPhoenix> @harrisboe citation needed
[3:23:08] <+gustavozxd> @shillelaghrod I'm just saying because some people seem desperate to discuss every single minor detail in every story and it's always like "how many bites of this cheeseburger did he actually take 🤔"
[3:23:09] <%Issun135> you can shine spark the CU
[3:23:14] <%scaryboisupreme> that's why RB is more like Skull Face than anything
[3:23:17] <+ALazo> struck by a wrinkly criminal
[3:23:18] <shillelaghrod> purple emmi has a cool cutscene :)
[3:23:20] <+bugz_munny> Im just going to say that Kraid is indestructible and literally floated through space
[3:23:22] <+bugz_munny> because fuck it
[3:23:32] <%solracc25> "boss" time
[3:23:35] <%scaryboisupreme> That's cool
[3:23:39] <%scaryboisupreme> and a good reason
[3:23:39] <Calamity2007> @crimsonharvest Yeah this game was made with a ton of sequence breaks. GDQ runs of this game are gonna be sick
[3:23:42] <Admiral_PopnFresh> ANDROSS
[3:23:43] <akitanito> doesn't plasma work well with robids
[3:23:43] <+gustavozxd> @nigelschnauzerpug in a way, because it's fucking dumb and funny yeah tbh
[3:23:43] <%scaryboisupreme> I'll accept that
[3:23:48] <Asuterisuku> Auntie Brain.
[3:23:49] <+harrisboe> @shinobiphoenix “according to the Metroid wiki” and it’s based on the illustration from getting 100% in Cataris
[3:23:49] <$Jaxnos> i like all of these Auntie Brains
[3:23:53] <ChungusQuest> An Aurora Brain?
[3:23:53] <@Moobot> Hey folks, just a reminder! If you have Twitch connected to Discord, you can access the PSA Sub-Discord. Go to your User Settings, go to Connections, and click 'Join' on the PSA server under the Twitch connection.
[3:23:55] <%scaryboisupreme> Kraid was so fat he kept his own orbit
[3:23:57] <%greasypete00> you can use regular beam on soft brain
[3:23:57] <@GeneralSCPatton> FYI, beam spam has the highest DPS
[3:23:58] <lloyddboy> BRUSSY
[3:24:03] <+zoopbooploop> I also love these brains
[3:24:04] <%tusk102> normal weapons can hurt the brains when you break the shell i think @PatStaresAt
[3:24:06] <majindusto> Cousin  Brain
[3:24:06] <Bek_359> man, it took me so many failed attempts at getting this EMMI, I just had to look up how to kill it
[3:24:08] <%ospreyworks> Pat's little "whee" sound is fucking adorable
[3:24:08] <%solracc25> cousin brain
[3:24:09] <%dekkitout> Capital G gun
[3:24:10] <hollumdusk> i like to Imaging Kraid waking up in Super, finding out that Ridley is dead, and Samus is on her way to fight mother, and saying "fuck this shit, I am out"
[3:24:14] <%NigelSchnauzerpug> @gustavozxd You think he was there for the grand opening in his Emperor robes?
[3:24:14] <%crimsonharvest> @Calamity2007 it just felt really inflexible with the default upgrade order you know
[3:24:16] <+Grayhammatter> [BIG SHOT]
[3:24:16] <+bugz_munny> he just kept crash landing on planets
[3:24:18] <+McDerpus> So many streamers have problems with this next part
[3:24:20] <+bugz_munny> Like a rock
[3:24:22] <+s1eepyshiba> @generalscpatton wish I woulda figured that out in game :x
[3:24:24] <+wizard_of_diamonds> REVENGE
[3:24:29] <%tusk102> nows your chance to be a big shot
[3:24:30] <Saltmeisterr> lets see if pat figures this out without chat
[3:24:33] <+zoopbooploop> I adore the way you get this one
[3:24:33] <miabyte> @patstaresat apparently you can mash fire and zr at the same time to shoot rockets and regular fire
[3:24:34] <shillelaghrod> @gustavozxd Yeah I get it 100 percent. It's just that in some games or stories overanalyzing is part of the fun. Dark Souls lore is my favorite thing in the universe because of how hilarious it is seeing people try to make sense of how DS1 2 and 3 are connected when the games basically say "in a galaxy far far away from our last game"
[3:24:37] <%ShinobiPhoenix> @harrisboe the very one that people are discussing here already that on top of being a spoiler is also CONSTANTLY and already being misinterpreted
[3:24:40] <GenericSoda> yeah this one has something very specific with it
[3:24:53] <Admiral_PopnFresh> Oh he comin
[3:24:56] <%crimsonharvest> emmi comin for that samussy
[3:25:04] <+gustavozxd> @nigelschnauzerpug maybe he has a secret suit he wears for special occasions
[3:25:06] <akitanito> too early
[3:25:09] <shillelaghrod> This EMMI takes longer to melt because he's ice cold 4Head
[3:25:10] <+lordericter> wasted
[3:25:12] <+wizard_of_diamonds> NO REVENGE
[3:25:12] <$Jaxnos> just slapped it in the face LUL
[3:25:12] <%tusk102> @crimsonharvest sussy
[3:25:16] <+Grayhammatter> emmi got that samussy
[3:25:16] <+Evendrag> get on the roof
[3:25:22] <WillofGame> Did that Emmi change colors?
[3:25:22] <+zoopbooploop> It's such a genius/unexpected solution for how to get this one
[3:25:24] <%Issun135> ceiling is good
[3:25:28] <Asuterisuku> Gotta pick your spot.
[3:25:28] <+bugz_munny> I think asking why how a character that died came back to life and moved planets is reasonable
[3:25:30] <seaechiowai> @crimsonharvest slayed it apparently
[3:25:36] <+harrisboe> @shinobiphoenix dude I just got here I don’t know why people are discussing. And who’s to say what is being misinterpreted when we have no confirmation one way or another?
[3:25:40] <%solracc25> you were in a good place before
[3:25:41] <%Bane_Kaikyo> @shillelaghrod I think that's actually true
[3:25:42] <%NigelSchnauzerpug> @gustavozxd "I grant this facility, unlimited FUNDING"
[3:25:46] <+lordericter> eyyy got it in 2
[3:25:48] <GenericSoda> yeah this took me awhile to figure out
[3:25:48] <Saltmeisterr> sure enough
[3:25:50] <+harrisboe> @shinobiphoenix what people are discussing*
[3:25:51] <%tusk102> hey pat what killed the dinosaurs Kappa
[3:25:53] <%ShinobiPhoenix> @harrisboe it;'s a single frame and people are pulling out whole imaginary histories to fit confirmation bias, especially when teh games themselves make it clear pretty much nothing survived Zebes intact
[3:25:58] <+McDerpus> you are like, the first person I've seen figure that out this quickly
[3:26:02] <akitanito> nice
[3:26:04] <+Grayhammatter> SHEESH
[3:26:05] <+s1eepyshiba> nice job pat
[3:26:07] <+wizard_of_diamonds> REVENGE!
[3:26:11] <$Jaxnos> stay frosty
[3:26:12] <+bugz_munny> Especially in a game that takes its story very seriously and to-the-letter
[3:26:12] <%dekkitout> @bugz_munny I'm more intrested in their daily moring routine. Favorite toast spreads and whatnot
[3:26:13] <Admiral_PopnFresh> sick
[3:26:13] <+zoopbooploop> Ice to meet you
[3:26:14] <SaltyAzteca> WHY DONT YOU CHILL OUT
[3:26:15] <+ReallyBigRocks> and then it gets back up and kills you
[3:26:15] <%RealThiele> pop
[3:26:19] <Asuterisuku> The Animals got off Zebes.
[3:26:21] <+gustavozxd> @shillelaghrod for sure, it's just that some people take it so seriously and end up missing the message of the story
[3:26:22] <ChaoticDaKiller> I like the trick of this EMMI
[3:26:22] <%xbb1024> absorb that robot!

[3:26:30] <akitanito> not ice beam?
[3:26:31] <%xbb1024> Samus Kirby
[3:26:33] <%RealThiele> Sub zero? now plain zero
[3:26:37] <+wizard_of_diamonds> That celebratory music LUL
[3:26:37] <+zuzuxiv> ice is nice :)
[3:26:38] <%Issun135> prime 3/fusion callback
[3:26:38] <+Grayhammatter> ah yes, ice beam
[3:26:39] <%TarikBot> Freeziepop jr
[3:26:40] <%scaryboisupreme> DON'T GIVE RAVEN BEAK THE COLD SHOULDER, SAMUS
[3:26:41] <%vehementvadr> ice ice baby
[3:26:41] <shillelaghrod> @gustavozxd true
[3:26:42] <%Deft_Thought> Woulda been great if you got a completely unrelated power
[3:26:43] <+s1eepyshiba> no ice beam since fusion
[3:26:44] <Holofono> ICE TO SEE YOU
[3:26:45] <%tusk102> chill
[3:26:45] <thatdudenamedlogan> In sci-fi world it isn't that hard to believe you could clone a bunch of Kraids or Ridleys for whatever bullshit reason you'd want.
[3:26:46] <+luketrapwalker> Gucci Mane would be proud
[3:26:50] <Calamity2007> Kinda wish it was ice beam but missles are fine
[3:26:51] <%ospreyworks> aprox. how far is he into the game?
[3:26:52] <+s1eepyshiba> Samus too much Metroid baby
[3:26:53] <@Ranryu692> Ice, ice, The Baby
[3:26:55] <Ravioli_Ronin> Mr Cool Ice missle
[3:27:01] <%ironmogar93> Ice? Ice! Baby.
[3:27:06] <%scaryboisupreme> I like ice missiles a lot
[3:27:06] <+s1eepyshiba> but I guess missiles don't count?
[3:27:07] <%tusk102> @PatStaresAt insert arnold batman joke
[3:27:07] <@GeneralSCPatton> They invented Ice Missiles in Fusion because Samus is allergic to Ice Beam unless she specifically absorbs the SA-X.
[3:27:09] <Calamity2007> Especially since ice missles are just a plain upgrade, not a seperate resource
[3:27:09] <%Issun135> melee a frozen enemy
[3:27:18] <%scaryboisupreme> I wish they still instantly froze things
[3:27:19] <+harrisboe> @shinobiphoenix nobody would’ve known if Kraid had survived intact if he was captured, so “the games making it clear nothing survived” doesn’t really apply. His survival was a secret to everybody
[3:27:21] <Onatamana> edgeguarding
[3:27:30] <%ShinobiPhoenix> @harrisboe there is no confirmation of anything, that's the problem, people are speaking on authority with something they have no authority on.  if anything, it's people's attitudes toward the whole thing instead of just ENJOYING tthe game gave anything at all and moving on
[3:27:30] <%greasypete00> melee is better on frozen enemies
[3:27:32] <%watts121> main issue I have with Dread is enemies are so chonky that counter is always the answer.
[3:27:33] <Bek_359> @ospreyworks Slightly past halfway
[3:27:39] <%scaryboisupreme> Samus could totally use the ice beam, there's just not one on the planet
[3:27:43] <+gustavozxd> @thatdudenamedlogan no, you need a whole comic book series and a game explaining every detail for these people to shut up atpCap
[3:27:44] <%Issun135> pats new favorite upgrade

[3:27:57] <LordOfThePoultry> new suit?

[3:28:00] <stormhawk9891> Best power
[3:28:02] <+Grayhammatter> god, that chozo statue is so cool
[3:28:04] <hollumdusk> it's not Just the frame, the game also calls him Kraid, so he either survive or got cloned, and him surviving ryses less questions that the clone theory. And it has to be either one or the other, for him recognizing Samus
[3:28:04] <+LastHazzerd> feels good
[3:28:05] <%ShinobiPhoenix> you could have had this upgrade a VERY long time ago and it wouldn't be a sequence break

[3:28:18] <%TheLemuroid> Goblins away!
[3:28:18] <Zeif00> Goblin Slayer
[3:28:18] <SaltyAzteca> Is that the X ray?
[3:28:18] <+zuzuxiv> this is it chief
[3:28:18] <+s1eepyshiba> way better than Samus returns tbh
[3:28:19] <tanarath> Gobolins eradicated
[3:28:19] <+McDerpus> I swear this game has like, every upgrade in the series except maybe ice beam and high jump
[3:28:19] <Visorak6> GOBLIN SLAYER
[3:28:20] <%solracc25> get good energy
[3:28:20] <+gustavozxd> I got this so much earlier than this and I don't even remember how
[3:28:21] <akitanito> best ability
[3:28:21] <%Monkeyweed21> BETTER
[3:28:21] <Calamity2007> ANTI GOBLIN ITEM
[3:28:25] <@Ranryu692> that was in Samus Returns
[3:28:26] <+lordericter> NO MORE LICKING THE CEILING
[3:28:26] <wqorst> cube locator
[3:28:26] <%tusk102> YEAAAAAAAAAA
[3:28:26] <+zoopbooploop> Finally, you are free from bombing everything
[3:28:27] <+Grayhammatter> the ANTI GOBLIN TECH
[3:28:27] <SaltyAzteca> ITS THE X RAY
[3:28:28] <%MashinChaserR> psaBougie
[3:28:30] <akitanito> mindgoblin sensor
[3:28:34] <Holofono> Kreygasm
[3:28:34] <linSP> GOBBOS GONE
[3:28:34] <+ReallyBigRocks> thing locator
[3:28:37] <%tusk102> ANTI GOBLIN TEC
[3:28:39] <%scaryboisupreme> This is such a much better implementation than in Samus Returns
[3:28:40] <%xbb1024> It's a lie detector for walls
[3:28:43] <%ShinobiPhoenix> it's better in this game because it's FREE
[3:28:43] <majindusto> GOODBYE  GOBLINS
[3:28:45] <+s1eepyshiba> but an even better echo visor!
[3:28:46] <Onatamana> I was so positive that statue was going to be a boss when I first saw it
[3:28:47] <DeeVee_TV> I got this a bit early
[3:28:51] <+ReallyBigRocks> the secret un-secreter
[3:28:52] <moonmeh> GOBBOS GET YE GONE
[3:28:53] <%doc_ock_rokc> AT LAST MY ARM IS COMPLETE
[3:28:56] <+bugz_munny> This was a samus returns item
[3:28:58] <%ShinobiPhoenix> in Samus Returns it ate resource
[3:28:59] <%Agami23> nope. whats the echo vizor
[3:29:02] <Calamity2007> This and the map is why this is the first metroid game I 100%
[3:29:04] <GManx0> Has Pat gone insane yet about clearing every darkened point on the map
[3:29:05] <+bugz_munny> They gave it to you super early
[3:29:06] <DeeVee_TV> well earlier i guess, maybe not early
[3:29:07] <+gustavozxd> @shinobiphoenix people are just saying "oh might be that, huh anyway who cares" you're the one going crazy about it
[3:29:11] <Ralfclogs> Goblin Slayer
[3:29:14] <%ShinobiPhoenix> Echo Visor is a Prime Items
[3:29:20] <marvel877> Its better here than in Samus Returns.
[3:29:27] <+zuzuxiv> honestly the visors in prime were so good
[3:29:30] <shillelaghrod> @watts121 Enemies are the least spongey in the series IMO.  I get it for bosses but the normal enemies just die super fast. Especially compared to Samus Returns. Screw attack is an instakill to basically everything too
[3:29:32] <+harrisboe> @shinobiphoenix what @gustavozxd said
[3:29:32] <+zuzuxiv> in the prime games*
[3:29:34] <@Ranryu692> Pat likes things that see and then hear, you say?
[3:29:36] <Bek_359> Echo Visor was only in Prime 2 iirc
[3:29:36] <+gustavozxd> the one in Metroid 2 was way too op, I'm glad they nerfed it here
[3:29:44] <+s1eepyshiba> back in my day we burned through our whole power bomb supply looking for one last item. we didn't have no fancy echo thingy
[3:29:59] <Asuterisuku> Not from this side.
[3:30:00] <%Issun135> ballspark
[3:30:04] <%RealThiele> goblins slayed
[3:30:04] <%greasypete00> you can get that now
[3:30:05] <shillelaghrod> @zuzuxiv They were just kinda dissapointing in the sense that Dark Visor and Echo Visor and X-ray visor and to an extent thermal visor all did the same thing
[3:30:08] <%watts121> whelp he has everything if he wanted to get Grav Suit early.
[3:30:10] <+bugz_munny> X-Ray was basically Echo by a different name
[3:30:13] <scarman125> yeah ballspark it LUL
[3:30:19] <miabyte> I sequence broke here and I was proud of myself
[3:30:30] <fairore> @s1eepyshiba LUL
[3:30:32] <+zuzuxiv> @shillelaghrod yeah but it was cool tho :'(
[3:30:38] <miabyte> shinesparks ftw
[3:30:40] <+Grayhammatter> the sequence break here is awesome mia
[3:30:40] <marvel877> The radar here is better than in Samus Returns because in Returns the radar was basically Detective Vision.
[3:30:44] <%zarkazeon> I think it's finally time to go back to water world
[3:30:55] <+McDerpus> ouya?
[3:30:57] <%Seyren1986> those things have faces
[3:31:05] <Onatamana> FUCK still not the surface
[3:31:07] <%doc_ock_rokc> BACK TO THE FUTURE
[3:31:09] <Asuterisuku> That's where you met Quiet Robe!
[3:31:11] <%ShinobiPhoenix> @gustavozxd they most certainly are not, don't even try being disingenuous like that, until the end I was openly trying to ignore the conversation until it got to annoying and needed to stopped. going on and on about it iss not 'oh it might be that, haha"
[3:31:12] <$Jaxnos> between two ferenias
[3:31:13] <%SaphronBlackbourne> you have
[3:31:13] <%RealThiele> :o
[3:31:16] <Bek_359> I managed to sequence break to get the Pulse Radar before reaching Gavoran the regular way
[3:31:18] <shillelaghrod> @zuzuxiv they were cool
[3:31:18] <%tusk102> ඞ
[3:31:23] <%NigelSchnauzerpug> What do you think she thinks about while on the elevators?
[3:31:27] <TheHotStuven> Samus parked on the highest mountaintop
[3:31:29] <%RealThiele> Anvilania
[3:31:32] <+zuzuxiv> dont question it
[3:31:32] <Blank9> imagine bottom of the mariana trench, if there was no ocean
[3:31:32] <GenericSoda> look the Chozo are super technologically advanced, they probably have something figured out
[3:31:32] <%Piemono> They're just not where your ship is
[3:31:33] <majindusto> Artificial  Sunlight?
[3:31:36] <%SaphronBlackbourne> I mean it's not where her ship is atl east
[3:31:37] <%TarikBot> Theyre illuminated by the Cave Light
[3:31:37] <LunarRemix> It makes for a cool alien looking planet though
[3:31:37] <Treasure_Vault> @NigelSchnauzerpug boob, probably
[3:31:37] <Onatamana> I assume it must be some form of artificial light or bioluminescence
[3:31:38] <IvanMistwalker> ඞ
[3:31:38] <fistynopunches> i think they are, just not where you landed
[3:31:39] <+Double_Tap_That> @NigelSchnauzerpug Pikachu
[3:31:40] <Saltmeisterr> @NigelSchnauzerpug DA BABY
[3:31:41] <shillelaghrod> LUL yeah the first area is like "you are deep within the depths of ZDR" but there's just a bunch of sunlight
[3:31:41] <%dekkitout> Nah, it's just the underground sunlight? You never heard of underground sunlight?
[3:31:44] <%ToadKing> that's not the sky that's.................. uh..
[3:31:45] <Onjani> You can see light rays coming from big holes in the bg
[3:31:46] <Psykoknight65> they are, she's just at the very top
[3:31:48] <%doc_ock_rokc> @NigelSchnauzerpug God this suit rides up
[3:31:49] <DeeVee_TV> chozo doggo
[3:31:52] <Louie_Salmon> It's just a REALLY big hill, and you parked on top of it.
[3:31:52] <Calamity2007> Artificial light powered by the lava
[3:31:53] <Blank9> big favorite
[3:31:53] <%watts121> @TheHotStuven that's how I justified it
[3:31:54] <%zarkazeon> oh.... oh no...
[3:31:55] <+gustavozxd> @shinobiphoenix omg who cares it's just a little side boss showing up for a reference
[3:31:56] <thatdudenamedlogan> Anyone else want Nightmare as a recurring boss like Ridley or Kraid?
[3:32:00] <Asuterisuku> This one's a big ol' NOT YET.
[3:32:05] <%solracc25> It's chozo magic sunlight
[3:32:06] <+Grayhammatter> here we go, shine spark puzzles galore
[3:32:10] <hollumdusk> according to Fusion, she has a lot of inner thoughts about the mission during the loading screens
[3:32:12] <+gustavozxd> the upgrade you get here is so fucking cool to get
[3:32:16] <Visorak6> Woolie did this one right now
[3:32:19] <Blank9> you can absolutely do it now
[3:32:20] <+harrisboe> @shinobiphoenix I literally said “the Metroid wiki suggests the possibility” and you acted like I was stating it as a confirmed fact. @gustavozxd is by no means being disingenuous
[3:32:22] <Calamity2007> @thatdudenamedlogan No I think between Fusion and Other M he has appeared enough
[3:32:29] <%RealThiele> yea its doable
[3:32:29] <+gustavozxd> the crazy shit you gotta do for some upgrades is nuts
[3:32:32] <+bugz_munny> I cant tell if this is triggering pat's goblins or helping them
[3:32:39] <akitanito> nice
[3:32:39] <Asuterisuku> Broke it.
[3:32:39] <+tomdwarf> Yeah shinespark!
[3:32:42] <hollumdusk> she may be also questioning why Adam doesn't calls her lady anymore
[3:32:47] <$Jaxnos> tricked ya
[3:32:47] <shillelaghrod> chill out with the metroid lore ppl, it will never make sense
[3:32:48] <%solracc25> figure ris one out
[3:32:48] <+zoopbooploop> You can't do this yet
[3:32:49] <+Emperor_Z> So there are at least two ways to approach this one, right? The way I did it had like, no more than a half-second of leeway
[3:32:50] <%watts121> this one sucks
[3:32:54] <%RealThiele> LUL
[3:32:57] <Calamity2007> These guys really wanted ot make you learn shinespark tec
[3:33:00] <Asuterisuku> THAT'S where you have to Spark.
[3:33:02] <+gustavozxd> took me reaaaaaallly long to figure this one out
[3:33:10] <+harrisboe> This one is really difficult
[3:33:10] <+Grayhammatter> this one does suck
[3:33:10] <wqorst> lol
[3:33:10] <shillelaghrod> D:
[3:33:11] <+zoopbooploop> Yeah
[3:33:12] <%ToadKing> LUL
[3:33:12] <%watts121> yep
[3:33:12] <Onatamana> BUT HOW
[3:33:13] <%scaryboisupreme> this one is a BITCH
[3:33:14] <+Dappercat> lol
[3:33:14] <+LastHazzerd> and there it is
[3:33:15] <%dekkitout> D:

[3:33:16] <$Jaxnos> gotcha good
[3:33:17] <+zuzuxiv> LMAOOO
[3:33:17] <+gustavozxd> you can totally do this one
[3:33:17] <+Grayhammatter> LUL
[3:33:18] <azure_dunes> I was waiting for that face lmao
[3:33:18] <GenericSoda> yeah this one is fucked up
[3:33:18] <Saltmeisterr> YEAH
[3:33:18] <Holofono> LUL
[3:33:18] <Blank9> this is the best
[3:33:18] <Tham1k> Figure this one out
[3:33:19] <+Double_Tap_That> Pat will figure it out
[3:33:19] <zk_nails> yep...
[3:33:19] <notabrobro> yeah these shinesparks don't fuck around
[3:33:21] <%baka_sugoi> sbfpSetIn
[3:33:21] <SaltyAzteca> THE REAL TEST STARTS NOW
[3:33:21] <%ShinobiPhoenix> there's now 4 confirmed way to do this
[3:33:21] <%watts121> this is an endgame one and it sucks
[3:33:21] <DrGasMax> have fun with this one
[3:33:22] <$Jaxnos> now become a god
[3:33:22] <Visorak6> This one is rough
[3:33:23] <marvel877> DO IT
[3:33:23] <+ClickyButtons> This one is so dope though
[3:33:23] <Louie_Salmon> Do you can do this right now
[3:33:24] <Saltmeisterr> DEWIT BITCH
[3:33:24] <%ForlornCarton> You do have what you need to do it.
[3:33:24] <Asuterisuku> LUL Pat's face
[3:33:25] <+Evendrag> This ones tuff to get
[3:33:26] <Onatamana> this one is a MOTHER FUCKER
[3:33:26] <olaksi> git gud
[3:33:27] <+DigiDom> LUL good luck
[3:33:28] <+gustavozxd> you can do this one right now but it's real hard
[3:33:28] <%TarikBot> The look of personal offense
[3:33:28] <%RealThiele> gottem
[3:33:29] <zk_nails> this one's a doozy
[3:33:30] <GenericSoda> wait CAN you do this one now???
[3:33:31] <%twistedj3ster> had to look up a guide for this shit
[3:33:31] <%SaiyanShoto> This one got me for a bit
[3:33:32] <+Grayhammatter> good luck... this one's a shitter
[3:33:33] <Treasure_Vault> This took Woolie a while
[3:33:33] <%scaryboisupreme> Pat you can totally do it
[3:33:34] <+JaydenJuiceman> You can do it SeemsGood
[3:33:34] <Calamity2007> Yeah just do it LUL
[3:33:34] <hairtoday> hey great game but fuck the speed booster in this game
[3:33:35] <+LastHazzerd> so YEAH, this is one of them get good puzzles
[3:33:36] <+harrisboe> This isn’t even the worst one
[3:33:36] <+attoram> That speed trap is the second hardest in the game cause of the timing required
[3:33:37] <+megaman_sentinel> dew it
[3:33:38] <%ShinobiPhoenix> but it would be easier later
[3:33:38] <+zoopbooploop> You can't do this one yet
[3:33:39] <%scaryboisupreme> but it's difficult
[3:33:40] <%solracc25> get to it
[3:33:41] <+bugz_munny> you can do this one now
[3:33:45] <Holofono> how can this ne
[3:33:47] <%ShinobiPhoenix> there's FOUR confirmed solutions
[3:33:47] <Saltmeisterr> slide it
[3:33:50] <%scaryboisupreme> ALMOST
[3:33:51] <tanarath> Woolie did it after some trial and error
[3:33:52] <GenericSoda> Pogchamp
[3:33:53] <%scaryboisupreme> ALMOST FIRST TRY
[3:33:55] <$Jaxnos> aaaay
[3:33:55] <+zuzuxiv> CLOSE
[3:33:55] <Asuterisuku> He almost had it.
[3:33:56] <%solracc25> slide
[3:33:57] <+bugz_munny> you've got the right idea
[3:33:57] <Louie_Salmon> @genericsoda Only need shinespark and morph bombs
[3:33:57] <+gustavozxd> you ALMOST got it
[3:34:00] <Kaji04> oh it's this part hell yeah
[3:34:04] <linSP> woolie got stuck here for a bit
[3:34:04] <LunarRemix> Man Samus looks like such a dork right now lol
[3:34:05] <+zoopbooploop> holy hell I didn't think you could slide that
[3:34:06] <Calamity2007> This and the shinespark puzzle with slopes were the two items that gave me the most trouble
[3:34:06] <%ShinobiPhoenix> but it's way easier later
[3:34:10] <%ToadKing> the ball buster
[3:34:12] <+gustavozxd> yeah I love it
[3:34:12] <+harrisboe> ALMOST FIRST TRY
[3:34:13] <Blank9> this is a tough one that teaches you new things
[3:34:14] <SaltyAzteca> They only get crazier
[3:34:21] <stormhawk9891> Wow he's getting these much quicker than other people I've seen
[3:34:26] <%SaiyanShoto> Oh wow this way is wayyy easier then what I did, I feel stupid LUL LUL
[3:34:27] <GenericSoda> that was SO close
[3:34:28] <%solracc25> now
[3:34:29] <shillelaghrod> @GenericSoda yep. He can. There's always at least 3 different ways to do these. If he had the new bomb upgrade he could just store the shinespark early and it would make it easier. I like that about this game
[3:34:30] <DrGasMax> wait this is how you are suppose to do it? I did it another way, crazy there are even multiple ways to do this
[3:34:30] <%Agami23> you can tell that the devs had alot of fun making the speed boost challenges
[3:34:32] <+ALazo> just do gooder
[3:34:33] <%watts121> someone at Mercury has the biggest hardon for Shinespark puzzles.
[3:34:33] <%Monkeyweed21> slide to the other side and then store it
[3:34:35] <Asuterisuku> Use the Morph to get all the way to the other side then charge Shine.
[3:34:37] <%ShinobiPhoenix> this actually isn't as hard as people think
[3:34:38] <%solracc25> but there are later tools
[3:34:41] <Kaji04> he doesn't get it yet
[3:34:43] <Spudmeister9000> l2 midair
[3:34:43] <zentzen> you canmorph ball in the hair
[3:34:43] <%scaryboisupreme> You gotta slide all the way to the end
[3:34:44] <+attoram> You have to get the shine spark on the opposite end of that tunnel
[3:34:45] <+zuzuxiv> go thru to the other side?
[3:34:45] <+Emperor_Z> Does morph ball end your boost?
[3:34:47] <Kaji04> he's so close tho
[3:34:52] <Saltmeisterr> u can't store in ball form
[3:34:52] <scarman125> momentum carries into morph ball
[3:34:52] <Calamity2007> @SaltyAzteca Arguably, this one probably was the worst for me
[3:34:53] <Tham1k> Can't store on ball?
[3:34:54] <@goose_attack_almanac> I think you have to go all the way through
[3:34:54] <tanarath> Cancel with zl?
[3:34:58] <%ShinobiPhoenix> it takes a matter of understanding WHAT keeps your charge and what loses your charge and how to keep it
[3:34:58] <+Grayhammatter> WOW
[3:35:00] <%tusk102> @PatStaresAt store te spark after slidig all the way through
[3:35:00] <shillelaghrod> @ShinobiPhoenix it's hard to figure out what to do, since you cant store ballsparks
[3:35:01] <wqorst> lolll
[3:35:01] <%scaryboisupreme> NO YOU FOGOT THE BOMB
[3:35:02] <+zoopbooploop> o o f

[3:35:07] <scarman125> LUL LUL
[3:35:07] <%Issun135> bomb first pat

[3:35:17] <+zuzuxiv> that's such a cool puzzle tho

[3:35:26] <%ShinobiPhoenix> well, more precise, what keeps and loses charge and what keeps and breaks your boost
[3:35:26] <+zoopbooploop> I didn't know about that slide solution
[3:35:28] <%silvery_cricket> Pat just bomb
[3:35:28] <GenericSoda> you just gotta execute better, you can do it
[3:35:33] <+Grayhammatter> god damn... that is tough
[3:35:33] <+Slattsquatch> You gotta EARN your 100% completion
[3:35:41] <+ReallyBigRocks> simply do the thing
[3:35:42] <+DigiDom> this is a execution challenge
[3:35:42] <$Jaxnos> gotta learn those rotations

[3:36:03] <%scaryboisupreme> Man I made that SO much more difficult for myself
[3:36:04] <+Emperor_Z> I did that one the stupid way, by storing then jumping up and getting over with cross bomb
[3:36:06] <%watts121> Pat's better than me, it took me like 20 minutes
[3:36:06] <+zuzuxiv> holy shit

[3:36:27] <mr_mister0> not yet
[3:36:30] <wantedsafe471> not possible
[3:36:30] <%Issun135> scan pulse
[3:36:30] <marvel877> You don't have the power to do it yet, Pat.
[3:36:30] <%zarkazeon> oh lord this boss was the worst 8n the entire game for me
[3:36:31] <SaltyAzteca> if only you had.....some kind of power.....
[3:36:31] <shillelaghrod> NO SPOILER BRO
[3:36:32] <%ShinobiPhoenix> Woolie did some weird shit as a ball
[3:36:35] <notabrobro> there's a thing in the previous room
[3:36:37] <%DeepPix3l> Time Stop needed
[3:36:38] <%RealThiele> shits locked
[3:36:39] <%solracc25> not yet
[3:36:40] <Louie_Salmon> You would have to stop time to shoot all those missiles at once.
[3:36:41] <$ArcanumArcanum> Pat needs Time Stop
[3:36:43] <%Issun135> go back and scan pulse
[3:36:45] <GenericSoda> you maye have gone too far in a few places
[3:36:45] <+gustavozxd> I fell in love with this game multiple times when these puzzles showed up
[3:36:46] <+zoopbooploop> scan
[3:36:47] <%silvery_cricket> Is Metroid Dread survival horror?
[3:36:50] <+ReallyBigRocks> pfft, pat doesn't even have time stop yet
[3:36:51] <%notsoy> don't spam bombs when you can just scan
[3:36:51] <Blank9> nope, use your sonar
[3:36:51] <%Monkeyweed21> PAT NO
[3:36:51] <+zuzuxiv> scan?
[3:36:52] <Calamity2007> If it is highlighted with ??? it suggests you need an upgrade you don't have
[3:36:54] <+Grayhammatter> scan?
[3:36:55] <olaksi> use the goblin tech pat
[3:36:56] <%watts121> scan in other orom
[3:37:02] <notabrobro> plasma shoots through the walls
[3:37:03] <+gustavozxd> atpCap P A T
[3:37:07] <GenericSoda> @silvery_cricket no. It's more about tension than horror
[3:37:07] <%scaryboisupreme> It's not survival horror lmao
[3:37:11] <+GalacticaPhanto> @silvery_cricket it has elements so maybe?
[3:37:17] <shillelaghrod> @silvery_cricket not at all. It's a power fantasy but harder and with less power at the beginning but more at the end
[3:37:23] <+ReallyBigRocks> Is this an Immersive Sim?
[3:37:23] <%ShinobiPhoenix> @notabrobro not Plasma, never has been Plasma
[3:37:25] <+LastHazzerd> genious patjumbo
[3:37:25] <Louie_Salmon> You... did it
[3:37:27] <+Grayhammatter> i can't believe pat doesn't have time stop yet
[3:37:37] <GenericSoda> survival horror is about being weak and underpowered, Metroid is about being a walking arsenal mowing down wildlife
[3:37:39] <%solracc25> psaBig brain
[3:37:46] <+gustavozxd> I've heard complaints about the secret blocks not being obvious in this game but they felt like the most obvious in the series
[3:37:56] <shillelaghrod> @GenericSoda yeah fuck that wildlife
[3:37:59] <%silvery_cricket> Hi Adam
[3:38:00] <%scaryboisupreme> isn't that activation noise the same that's in Dishonored
[3:38:02] <shillelaghrod> Kappa
[3:38:02] <Visorak6> woolie spent 25 minutes doing this one
[3:38:05] <+gustavozxd> @genericsoda and walls
[3:38:07] <olaksi> sex rituals??
[3:38:16] <GenericSoda> @gustavozxd fuck them walls
[3:38:20] <%ShinobiPhoenix> Plasma goes through enemies, Wave goes through Walls, Plasma with Wave goes through everything, but only in Super would you be able to turn Beams off to try them out
[3:38:22] <SaltyAzteca> ??????
[3:38:25] <+Double_Tap_That> @gustavozxd How can they NOT be obvious once you have the scan?
[3:38:25] <+gustavozxd> @visorak6 I probably took something like that too LUL
[3:38:27] <+bugz_munny> Powerful ass?
[3:38:34] <+bugz_munny> I heard powerful ass
[3:38:36] <hollumdusk> the game teach you to shoot at everything when in doubt in the tutorial, anyway.
[3:38:36] <shillelaghrod> my sensors Kappa
[3:38:37] <%solracc25> kill Chaos
[3:38:42] <Blu_C> Darn that X Parasite. If only it didn't manage to get out. Samus.
[3:38:46] <Asuterisuku> Samus doesn't know that QR-X turned them back on.
[3:38:46] <$SGrim> Raven Beak is such a shit-eater name
[3:38:46] <marvel877> @scaryboisupreme that required consumables to power that, this one replenishes automatically.
[3:38:47] <SaltyAzteca> CHAOS?
[3:38:47] <%silvery_cricket> Bye Adam
[3:38:50] <shillelaghrod> WE NEED TO KILL CHAOS
[3:38:50] <%BlueVanRoss> I fucking HATE this EMMI
[3:38:51] <+brandanvh> HA HA, funny story adam
[3:38:52] <%scaryboisupreme> There is a very powerful ass here
[3:38:56] <Faithless_Zealot> MrDestructoid All your base!
[3:38:57] <ammobasket> Phantom cloak vs scanner, eh?
[3:39:02] <redwidow1358> Hey Pat, do you have a compressor on your master audio output or the game audio? The reverb on Adam's voice gets super loud every time he stops talking and it's super distracting.
[3:39:02] <+gustavozxd> @double_tap_that scan takes quite a while to get, and you have to run past several secret blocks before you have a chance to get it
[3:39:04] <%ShinobiPhoenix> I think all of the EMMis are fun
[3:39:11] <GenericSoda> this Emmi is the worst, have fun with it
[3:39:30] <Calamity2007> @ShinobiPhoenix Same
[3:39:38] <%ShinobiPhoenix> there's only one that is more stressful, but it's not hard as much as you need to be patient
[3:39:38] <%SuckerPunchSyd> Does ADAM stand for anything? Like is it an acronym?
[3:39:38] <shillelaghrod> @ammobasket not really, no reason not to use the scanner. The bar regens like a stamina bar now, so it just makes it so you can't spam all your aieon at once
[3:39:48] <TheHotStuven> Cold goblins
[3:39:49] <+gustavozxd> I liked all the emmis but the purple one is the one that got me mad salty
[3:39:52] <%ShinobiPhoenix> and HIDE a lot and run
[3:39:52] <+Grayhammatter> big cold
[3:39:54] <+Emperor_Z> Plus, saying you have a limiter makes it sound like you're incredibly powerful
[3:39:57] <%scaryboisupreme> It's weird that the varia doesn't protect from cold
[3:40:13] <%Issun135> you can melee a fonzen enemy to insta-kill it
[3:40:15] <%ShinobiPhoenix> @scaryboisupreme see, I said exactly that
[3:40:16] <TheHotStuven> metroid DNA HATES cold
[3:40:17] <ammobasket> @shillelaghrod I mean this EMMI has a scanner
[3:40:24] <fistynopunches> @SuckerPunchSyd no it was just his name before
[3:40:25] <%tusk102> @scaryboisupreme samus is part metroid and the suit is biorganic
[3:40:29] <Asuterisuku> Oops All X
[3:40:30] <%scaryboisupreme> Maybe this is ADVANCED cold
[3:40:40] <%SuckerPunchSyd> @fistynopunches ah gotcha gotcha thanks!
[3:40:41] <%greasypete00> its every thing on the whole planet now
[3:40:42] <tanarath> X is soft-grey goo
[3:40:49] <+gustavozxd> melee is an insta kill when they're frozen
[3:40:49] <+Grayhammatter> oops, all X
[3:40:50] <+Emperor_Z> If you melee a frozen enemy, it immediately dies
[3:40:52] <%scaryboisupreme> Yeah but the Varia suit worked fine in the cold in Fusion
[3:40:54] <%BaitsaDasuto> BaitsaDasuto subscribed at Tier 1. They've subscribed for 10 months! 
[3:41:05] <+LCGOV> Pat you can destroy enemies that are frozen with the melee
[3:41:07] <+gustavozxd> did pat ever use the running melee?
[3:41:17] <%tusk102> @PatStaresAt you can melee frozen enemies for big damge
[3:41:24] <%ShinobiPhoenix> I enjoy most designers just keep the frozen enemies die from blunt force idea in games
[3:41:28] <shillelaghrod> @ammobasket ahh i see what you mean. But every EMMI has a "scanner." This emmi could just shoot orbs at you. That's it's shtick
[3:41:41] <+gustavozxd> running melee is waaaay easier to time
[3:41:46] <%ShinobiPhoenix> if someone doesn't have that, you're like "WTF, it was frozen, why it is not dead?"
[3:41:52] <%Issun135> purple emmi is built different be warned
[3:41:54] <%Bane_Kaikyo> @ShinobiPhoenix yeah it's really nice
[3:42:04] <%ShinobiPhoenix> running or FLASH-step melee
[3:42:06] <shillelaghrod> see through terrain? nevermind then guess I'm wrong
[3:42:07] <+Emperor_Z> I fucking hate those spidery guys, because they basically dont seem to work fairly if they dont start from far enough away
[3:42:09] <scarman125> purple emmi is fucking scary
[3:42:10] <ammobasket> @shillelaghrod SeemsGood
[3:42:13] <%ShinobiPhoenix> flash step melee is very safe
[3:42:13] <Blank9> ice was worse
[3:42:20] <Asuterisuku> Use the Grapple Beam to move faster under here.
[3:42:25] <marvel877> see AND SHOOT THROUGH TERRAIN
[3:42:26] <LordOfThePoultry> monkaS
[3:42:28] <+Emperor_Z> ADAM neglected to mention its strongest feature. Infinite hearing range
[3:42:28] <%tusk102> purple is straight up built different
[3:42:30] <%greasypete00> this emmi is legitimately terrifying
[3:42:36] <%dekkitout> It's blue SeriousSloth
[3:42:39] <+gustavozxd> NICE
[3:42:43] <shillelaghrod> @ammobasket Just played this game 3 times and forgot. Still tho I was half right cause he still shoots stuff.... right? Kappa
[3:42:43] <+McDerpus> smooth
[3:42:52] <%tusk102> nice
[3:42:58] <%extradopeness> nice
[3:43:05] <+Evendrag> see thats the metroid feeliing right there
[3:43:06] <+Grayhammatter> cheesed this one
[3:43:07] <%scaryboisupreme> wow pat you must have been a genius to figure out to bomb that ceiling.
[3:43:10] <%ShinobiPhoenix> those little tiny enemies straight up surprise you with that FULL SCREEN attack
[3:43:13] <%Agami23> purple emmi gave me the most trouble, because its entire zone is the yellow alert space
[3:43:21] <%Issun135> largest brain
[3:43:35] <Calamity2007> @Evendrag Impressive it can still do it even this late in the game
[3:43:38] <+RobotCo_Op> 43 raiders from RobotCo_Op have joined! 
[3:43:40] <LunarRemix> Pat's such a gamer
[3:43:42] <%greasypete00> melee when frozen
[3:43:44] <+gustavozxd> door gooers
[3:43:48] <Onatamana> X is doing everything it can to slow your progress
[3:43:51] <%scaryboisupreme> It's gonna be fun dunking on Jaffe
[3:43:52] <%tusk102> @PatStaresAt melee frozen enemies
[3:43:53] <ammobasket> @shillelaghrod I just thought it was weird that ADAM was like, strangely confident in the cloak after saying this one has a better scanner. I figured it would disrupt the cloak somehow
[3:43:54] <%BlueVanRoss> pat melee when the freeze
[3:43:56] <Blank9> can also melee frozen enemies
[3:44:04] <akitanito> he can stun through walls
[3:44:06] <%dekkitout> *Determined Beeping*
[3:44:13] <ammobasket> @shillelaghrod Causing more panic ;)
[3:44:20] <+gustavozxd> uh og

[3:47:11] <+gustavozxd> bio computers
[3:47:11] <Calamity2007> @twistedj3ster Nice
[3:47:17] <+gustavozxd> X is a bio curse then
[3:47:27] <Asuterisuku> The funny thing about fighting X; you get health and missiles back REAL quick.
[3:47:36] <Caltropical> security robot in fusion had an organic brain they took over
[3:47:42] <hollumdusk> the security robot in fusion had organic elements.
[3:47:42] <%zarkazeon> oh boy......
[3:47:52] <Saltmeisterr> here comes the worse boss in the game
[3:47:57] <+Grayhammatter> the only reason that one robot got infected in fusion was because it was a bio computer right?
[3:48:02] <%SaiyanShoto> Can't you shinespark this boss?
[3:48:03] <%scaryboisupreme> fuck this bug
[3:48:04] <Calamity2007> @Asuterisuku I guess that is the trade off to their annoying respawning and fusing mechanic
[3:48:07] <Bek_359> good luck with this boss
[3:48:08] <%Issun135> this boss sucked ngl
[3:48:13] <wqorst> lol
[3:48:13] <%ShinobiPhoenix> THIS GUY!
[3:48:14] <%extradopeness> x-chozo is way cooler than SA-X
[3:48:15] <GenericSoda> yeah this thing really frustrated me
[3:48:16] <Calamity2007> This boss gave me the most shit
[3:48:19] <scarman125> that's it he says LUL
[3:48:19] <+Grayhammatter> that's it he says LUL
[3:48:20] <miabyte> omg imagine an X mother brain
[3:48:27] <%scaryboisupreme> You can shinespark it
[3:48:28] <Asuterisuku> "That's it," he says
[3:48:32] <%ShinobiPhoenix> this guy and ONE other boss SUCK!
[3:48:34] <+gustavozxd> I thought this boss was pretty simple
[3:48:39] <Nocturnment> shinesparking it kills it in like 10 seconds
[3:48:42] <nickdooody> fuck this boss
[3:48:43] <Bek_359> This guy has  hard-to-dodge attacks and is invulnerable a lot of the time
[3:48:44] <%scaryboisupreme> on hard mode this thing can suck my ass
[3:48:46] <akitanito> fuck those patterns
[3:48:48] <redwidow1358> This boss gave me more shit than the final boss, though I did have all the energy tanks by the final boss so idk which one was actually harder
[3:48:51] <+gustavozxd> not easy but... just pay attention and dodge and shoot
[3:48:53] <Calamity2007> @miabyte Indeed. X Ridley was bad enough
[3:48:53] <%ShinobiPhoenix> he's annoying as hell
[3:48:54] <DeeVee_TV> massive damage
[3:48:58] <%Teyaric> this universes federation likes bio computers - the brain series thingies are central processors in their bases right? and the pirates just had an evil one?
[3:48:59] <%SaiyanShoto> This boss fucked me up but he was fun to fight
[3:48:59] <DeeVee_TV> giant enemy beetle
[3:49:04] <%ShinobiPhoenix> you can beat him, but it's a annoying
[3:49:08] <%MegadBlitz> YEAH THIS BOSS the silly music is the bes part!
[3:49:09] <Nocturnment> my bad screw attack kills it in 10 seconds

[3:49:29] <%Princ3Mush> psaCrazyhand psaCrazyhead

[3:49:33] <+SolidusRex> That happened to me in Fusion all the damned time
[3:49:34] <Bek_359> Core-X makes its triumphant return
[3:49:34] <thatdudenamedlogan> X Gonna give it to ya
[3:49:37] <qu3kl41n_the_impure_king> whatever, checkpoints are MAD generous in this game
[3:49:38] <GenericSoda> I also had like two fewer energy tanks than pat so I got my shit pushed in here
[3:49:39] <Caltropical> @Teyaric Mother Brain was a chozo bio computer that took control of the pirates after going rogue
[3:49:40] <+eddie_hedgehog> losing to mini boss LUL
[3:49:42] <Calamity2007> I love they remembered the Core X
[3:49:45] <%doc_ock_rokc> Try not dying
[3:50:06] <+gustavozxd> the dodge in this game is so OP, idk how people had that much trouble with him
[3:50:18] <+Shadow_Fenrir24> Finally caught Pat online all these years
[3:50:20] <%scaryboisupreme> Shoot the goop bug until it dies
[3:50:25] <GenericSoda> I completely forgot the dodge lmao
[3:50:25] <Calek> imagine if you could dodge through enemies
[3:50:36] <SaltyAzteca> One missile at a time
[3:50:38] <%Issun135> sometimes you'd dodge and a homing projectile would still tag you
[3:50:39] <GenericSoda> I didn't even use it against the final boss much because I kept fucking up the timing
[3:50:43] <akitanito> x-pinata
[3:50:45] <gygias10> Someone should have played fusion
[3:50:45] <olaksi> eat the gummi dispenser
[3:50:50] <Tham1k> Ez
[3:50:53] <%scaryboisupreme> GOOOOOOD I want a remake of Fusion
[3:50:55] <Blank9> best weapon

[3:51:05] <%scaryboisupreme> Hey pat remember Seeker Missiles
[3:51:05] <Kaji04> mm gummeee
[3:51:05] <%ShinobiPhoenix> technically  Mercury Steam got to make their Fusion Remake in all but name
[3:51:06] <%extradopeness> YEEEEE
[3:51:06] <Asuterisuku> So you now have the most powerful weapon in the game.
[3:51:06] <californaya> Storm Missile, my favorite MMX boss
[3:51:09] <%Agami23> is it weird to think that the X parasites look really tasty?
[3:51:09] <Bek_359> Now you have Dakka missiles
[3:51:11] <redwidow1358> Great item
[3:51:12] <%Dova573> YEH BEST SHIT
[3:51:12] <%vehementvadr> X'D OUT X
[3:51:13] <%TarikBot> Oh thats AWESOME
[3:51:15] <+gustavozxd> YOU LIKE METROID PRIME
[3:51:15] <%dekkitout> Missile circus
[3:51:17] <+Emperor_Z> I love Storm Missile
[3:51:19] <+gustavozxd> HERE YOU GO
[3:51:20] <%watts121> my favorite powerup
[3:51:22] <+McDerpus> Mecury Steam apparently wanted to remake fusion when they first went to Nintendo, you can tell they love that game
[3:51:23] <thatdudenamedlogan> Nightmare is an underrated boss from Fusion that I think should make recurring appearences.
[3:51:23] <%AncelDeLambert> MISSILE STOOOOOORM FWOOOOM!
[3:51:26] <+gustavozxd> here's your Metroid prime
[3:51:28] <%extradopeness> THIS ONE IS THE BEST
[3:51:29] <%ShinobiPhoenix> Samus finally gets TRULY new weapon
[3:51:29] <akitanito> missile is basically free resource in this game anyway
[3:51:29] <TheHotStuven> I heard you liked Metroid Prime 2
[3:51:32] <GenericSoda> You got the Itano Parade!
[3:51:35] <Calamity2007> @Agami23 They do. Like fruit snacks that eat you
[3:51:36] <stormhawk9891> THIS is why they give you so many missiles
[3:51:40] <%greasypete00> literally never fire the regukar beam again
[3:51:45] <+Grayhammatter> seeker missiles, but better
[3:51:54] <GenericSoda> or is it itano circus
[3:51:56] <+gustavozxd> storm missile is mad buff
[3:52:04] <+Shadow_Fenrir24> @McDerpus I didnt know about Fusion
[3:52:08] <%ShinobiPhoenix> you can do it while moving too
[3:52:10] <%extradopeness> ALL STROMBOLI PEOPLE
[3:52:12] <Onatamana> cluster missile ready
[3:52:13] <Blank9> it's so strong
[3:52:14] <+gustavozxd> most enemies become a joke
[3:52:16] <%watts121> storm missile eats through bosses so fast
[3:52:17] <%greasypete00> its just not fair to the enemies at this point
[3:52:18] <+bugz_munny> a powerup that's NOT just a door openner
[3:52:18] <markdreizehn> The picture of Samus screaming GIMMIE THE JUICE at X Parasites is great
[3:52:24] <GenericSoda> yeah Storm missile does a billion damage so you can just flee from enemies and pepper them to death with it
[3:52:26] <%DeepPix3l> No time stop... psaDown
[3:52:30] <TheHotStuven> That was a real boss LUL
[3:52:32] <%Teyaric> it's an Itano Circus. carnival is also valid, but less common
[3:52:34] <+Grayhammatter> like a central unit?
[3:52:37] <%ShinobiPhoenix> charging the Storm while dodging and just getting your lock ons and releasing while dodging agian
[3:52:41] <%AncelDeLambert> that was a boss
[3:52:44] <@GeneralSCPatton> But that was a boss
[3:52:45] <ToneBacas> Pat are you doing the thing where you're being led by the nose to the next upgrade until you have all of them so you can explore everywhere?
[3:52:47] <+gustavozxd> next boss is wild
[3:52:47] <Nocturnment> storm missle does more dps but it will eat through your ammo
[3:52:49] <+bugz_munny> It actually was lol
[3:52:53] <Calamity2007> That was the boss
[3:52:54] <%zarkazeon> it was actually...
[3:52:54] <%AncelDeLambert> Pat, you just got a major traversal mechanic
[3:52:55] <+Grayhammatter> that was a boss though
[3:53:04] <%greasypete00> it was a real boss some of them are just weird and seem like mid bosses
[3:53:04] <%BlueVanRoss> it is technically considered a boss check the map
[3:53:05] <Airuzen> this game is pretty
[3:53:07] <+gustavozxd> oh yeah that was a real boss that apparently people struggle with LUL
[3:53:07] <%X2Eliah> pog
[3:53:09] <+bugz_munny> Its on the map as a boss!
[3:53:19] <redwidow1358> You did a boss just now lol
[3:53:21] <Onatamana> That's a boss ass fuckin' boss, Pat. It had the fancy boss door and everything.
[3:53:23] <%extradopeness> i just fought a really cool boss
[3:53:28] <%ShinobiPhoenix> missile ammo is pretty free in this game, especially after counters
[3:53:32] <Calamity2007> That boss gave me tons of shit I can't believe you beat it so easily @PatStaresAt
[3:53:35] <+KaijuUltimax> @gustavozxd It's only struggle because it's damage numbers are so big and the projectiles are so many
[3:53:36] <+Shadow_Fenrir24> my ocd with the map fill
[3:53:47] <+bugz_munny> look at that big dumb demon head on that room
[3:53:57] <Calamity2007> @ShinobiPhoenix Yeah I don't think I ran out of missles a single time in this game
[3:53:58] <@Moobot> Hey folks, just a reminder! If you have Twitch connected to Discord, you can access the PSA Sub-Discord. Go to your User Settings, go to Connections, and click 'Join' on the PSA server under the Twitch connection.
[3:54:00] <tanarath> @patstaresat you're the red helmet
[3:54:03] <Onatamana> @Shadow_Fenrir24 FINALLY SOMEONE WHO UNDERSTANDS
[3:54:16] <+gustavozxd> @kaijuultimax the homing is tricky to dodge but the rest make sense that they do a lot since they're so slow
[3:54:22] <DeeVee_TV> the hubris on this mans
[3:54:22] <GenericSoda> HOW IS HE SO GOOD
[3:54:22] <wantedsafe471> nice
[3:54:24] <Asuterisuku> Pat's a madman
[3:54:27] <ToneBacas> this man can't stop parrying
[3:54:28] <Holofono> LUL scrub emmi
[3:54:30] <+Emperor_Z> The timing is random and human-unreactable. How is he doing it so consistently!?
[3:54:35] <+Shadow_Fenrir24> @Onatamana I always got to fill out the map in any metroidvania
[3:54:36] <Calamity2007> Clip it
[3:54:36] <+Grayhammatter> god, i suck at parryinf emmi
[3:54:41] <redwidow1358> The purple EMMI parry is actually pretty easy tbh
[3:54:42] <%ShinobiPhoenix> now for me, the hardest boss is coming up
[3:54:43] <ToneBacas> it might be the red bull
[3:54:47] <%greasypete00> is it not?
[3:54:48] <Blank9> can melee parry frozen enemies for instakills
[3:54:50] <%X2Eliah> Timing is super random, Pat is just lucky
[3:54:56] <akitanito> ot
[3:54:58] <Asuterisuku> It's not random.
[3:54:58] <olaksi> pat consistently putting chat to shame with thisgame
[3:55:03] <Tham1k> It is random but it might be reactable
[3:55:03] <redwidow1358> They're different between EMMIs but the timing is consistent
[3:55:04] <%MrP33Ps> One guy
[3:55:05] <%ShinobiPhoenix> that one was a PAIN IN THE ASS, I beat it, but there were attaacks I did not understand
[3:55:05] <%Issun135> it does differ from emmi to emmi
[3:55:06] <%AncelDeLambert> god Samus is SO COOL
[3:55:08] <Calamity2007> ***
[3:55:09] <%greasypete00> because the game tells you its random outright
[3:55:11] <Spudmeister9000> its not random
[3:55:12] <+gustavozxd> felt unreactable on emulator but it was on emulator so idk
[3:55:14] <%MrP33Ps> It isn't random
[3:55:15] <Asuterisuku> It varies situationally.
[3:55:16] <mackumbopus> the ammi eye turning red is a better indicator than the flash
[3:55:16] <GenericSoda> here we go
[3:55:16] <TheHotStuven> LUL
[3:55:16] <DeeVee_TV> pat sees in flash time because hes a gamer
[3:55:17] <+Gorgodrn> It is not random
[3:55:18] <Spudmeister9000> different emmis have different timings
[3:55:20] <$SGrim> You want for the light, and click the button...
[3:55:21] <GenericSoda> hope you like those storm missiles
[3:55:21] <%Issun135> have fun lmao
[3:55:21] <+Emperor_Z> It's random within a small window
[3:55:23] <%greasypete00> GET READY FOR FUCK
[3:55:23] <LordOfThePoultry> monkaS
[3:55:24] <+Grayhammatter> here we go
[3:55:25] <%Nekros4442> oh hell
[3:55:28] <lloyddboy> two of them!!!!
[3:55:28] <+the22cstomp> agni and rudra time
[3:55:29] <%ShinobiPhoenix> it's not about random, it's about REACTION
[3:55:30] <tanarath> the frames vary between each emmi because each emmi has different animations
[3:55:30] <+PJSmooth> Its random on hard
[3:55:32] <+Shadow_Fenrir24> SeemsGood
[3:55:33] <Saltmeisterr> ORNSTEIN AND SMAUG
[3:55:34] <%ShinobiPhoenix> Pat is reacting to the frame
[3:55:34] <gygias10> Pats reactions are the best
[3:55:35] <+bugz_munny> Ironically this one is easier
[3:55:35] <%extradopeness> heres your boss
[3:55:35] <Onatamana> This room: "lmao get fucked"
[3:55:36] <%MrP33Ps> Each EMMI has a different timing. Not random
[3:55:38] <Bek_359> enjoy this "real boss"
[3:55:40] <Calamity2007> This is getting out of hand, now there are two of them
[3:55:42] <%scaryboisupreme> I did this first try on hard with like 1 health remaining
[3:55:42] <$Jaxnos> this is awesome
[3:55:42] <+zoopbooploop> There's a reason there's a full restore station right before this room
[3:55:43] <akitanito> fuuck
[3:55:44] <+zuzuxiv> AW YEAH ORNSTEIN AND SMOUGH
[3:55:44] <$OfficerMods> wait
[3:55:44] <+McDerpus> nah, sometime they will do shit like face fuck you right when opening the eye
[3:55:45] <%Agami23> YEYEYEYE
[3:55:45] <%DeepPix3l> You wanted your boss fight
[3:55:46] <olaksi> pat you should shoot them
[3:55:47] <+MisterAvry> these guys are pushing your poo in
[3:55:47] <%scaryboisupreme> it fucking felt so good
[3:55:49] <+gustavozxd> these guys are here to show how OP the storm missile is
[3:55:51] <%Teyaric> bosses so badass it kills the commentary cold
[3:55:57] <%extradopeness> and yea storm missiles are the move her
[3:55:59] <%Nekros4442> oof that hits?
[3:55:59] <%scaryboisupreme> The Chobots
[3:56:00] <%TarikBot> At least youve got room to run around now
[3:56:01] <TehMud> pew pew pew
[3:56:02] <+Grayhammatter> this seems like a pain in the ass
[3:56:03] <+bugz_munny> Big baiting this one
[3:56:04] <%twohitgood> that reach
[3:56:05] <%Seyren1986> it took me a while to figure this one out
[3:56:06] <%Issun135> flash backs to those 2 black space pirates in ridley lair
[3:56:07] <+MisterAvry> That's a deadly duo
[3:56:07] <+bugz_munny> keep runing
[3:56:08] <ToneBacas> is this a Smash arena?
[3:56:09] <TehMud> They came to play
[3:56:09] <rosabellamelantha> GRACE AND GLORY
[3:56:09] <GenericSoda> @gustavozxd yeah. they pushed my shit in until I used it and then I did them in by accident
[3:56:09] <%Bane_Kaikyo> Naw, it's Ornstein and Ornstein...
[3:56:10] <%greasypete00> orstein and smough but theyre both super ornstein
[3:56:12] <thatdudenamedlogan> Glad the Chozo made a comeback
[3:56:16] <Saltmeisterr> remember plasma pierces enemies
[3:56:17] <lloyddboy> was that a cow mooing of gief snoring?
[3:56:21] <Asuterisuku> The checkpoints are super generous.
[3:56:21] <%scaryboisupreme> Plasma beam is your best friend here
[3:56:22] <Calamity2007> Honestly the one in the forest gave me more trouble
[3:56:23] <%MugenSandan> you know the double marauder room in doom eternal was pretty cool
[3:56:27] <DeeVee_TV> like....
[3:56:31] <+gustavozxd> @grayhammatter it's not that hard, you just gotta be moving at all times, they're not that fast
[3:56:32] <+MisterAvry> Ornstein and Ornstein
[3:56:34] <%scaryboisupreme> I can never get the parry on these guys
[3:56:37] <%tusk102> @PatStaresAt normal shots might hurt them
[3:56:44] <Calamity2007> @Asuterisuku Which I am thankful for
[3:56:45] <scarman125> these take damage from plasma beam
[3:56:48] <TehMud> Naw Pat
[3:56:53] <Calamity2007> Normal shots do not hurt these guys
[3:56:56] <Blank9> the  damage on storm missiles
[3:56:56] <%Bane_Kaikyo> @Asuterisuku Thank fuck they are too.... imagine going back to save points each death
[3:56:58] <+Grayhammatter> wow
[3:56:58] <TehMud> Naw Pat's got the strat down
[3:57:01] <GenericSoda> yeah the Storm Missile is buff

[3:57:12] <%Agami23> you know, i never did use the storm missles for combat, maybe i should have.
[3:57:12] <%Mr_Pylon> I legit completely forgot about the storm missile for the entire game after getting it.
[3:57:13] <ammobasket> O K
[3:57:13] <Roglef> storm missiles be stronk
[3:57:15] <+gustavozxd> the one in the forest fucked me up on hard LUL
[3:57:17] <+Shadow_Fenrir24> storm missle seems really op
[3:57:21] <%ToadKing> storm missiles rock
[3:57:21] <+Grayhammatter> that was wild
[3:57:22] <rosabellamelantha> @PatStaresAt on hard mode these guys have way more health and thus the fight takes way longer
[3:57:24] <+MisterAvry> Pat good at video games
[3:57:26] <TehMud> Whoever said "USE PLASMA" is a fool. Storm Missile DESTROYS those idiots.
[3:57:26] <+zoopbooploop> Doesn't it feel good to be STRONG
[3:57:27] <Calek> storm missiles so good
[3:57:27] <Onatamana> Storm missiles worth the extra cost
[3:57:38] <+Shadow_Fenrir24> SeemsGood SeemsGood SeemsGood
[3:57:39] <%Nekros4442> TASTY PARASITE
[3:57:40] <Calamity2007> @Shadow_Fenrir24 They are but I sucked at using them
[3:57:40] <Calek> storm missiles destroy everything
[3:57:43] <Blank9> that vertical passage stopped woolie for half an hour
[3:57:47] <Louie_Salmon> @rosabellamelantha Gotta get them shinesparks in there
[3:57:49] <Paperware> Watching Pat melt those guys makes me feel real stupid for not using them at all
[3:57:51] <%ShinobiPhoenix> it's almost like good things cost more
[3:57:53] <+bugz_munny> the boss killer from here on out
[3:57:54] <Asuterisuku> Pat gets nuked
[3:57:57] <+gustavozxd> @agami23 probably the highest damaging attack on most fights, you can skip some boss phases of you hit them enough with it
[3:58:00] <+ReallyBigRocks> sick
[3:58:04] <+Emperor_Z> @Onatamana Especially considering missile capacity is a joke in this game with the rate you get them back
[3:58:06] <+zoopbooploop> SPACE JUMP
[3:58:07] <+Grayhammatter> SICK
[3:58:08] <+gustavozxd> infinite jumping
[3:58:09] <Roglef> here we go
[3:58:09] <%ShinobiPhoenix> SP{ACE JAM!@
[3:58:09] <%scaryboisupreme> what is the point of double jump
[3:58:10] <Calamity2007> YES
[3:58:10] <$Jaxnos> now we're feelin it
[3:58:11] <+MisterAvry> Cool
[3:58:11] <scarman125> this is the one
[3:58:11] <%AncelDeLambert> there it iiiiiis
[3:58:13] <californaya> YEE YEE YEE
[3:58:14] <scarman125> breaks the game
[3:58:14] <+BioStormX> Even better
[3:58:14] <%Issun135> infinite jumps
[3:58:14] <+tomdwarf> Wow, Space Jump at this point?
[3:58:15] <SaltyAzteca> JUMP FOREVER
[3:58:15] <@OfficioPrefectusCorgi> no
[3:58:15] <+ReallyBigRocks> jump in space
[3:58:15] <nickdooody> haha nope
[3:58:15] <ammobasket> Welcome to the Space Jump
[3:58:16] <+Grayhammatter> haha... no
[3:58:17] <Tham1k> Jump in space
[3:58:17] <Blank9> jump in space
[3:58:17] <+tomdwarf> Infinite jump
[3:58:18] <+D00msDayDan> easy mode is now enabled
[3:58:18] <+Dappercat> JUMP FOREVER
[3:58:18] <Asuterisuku> Infinite consecutive jumps
[3:58:18] <%Nekros4442> oh fuck
[3:58:20] <Calek> no it's jump in SPACE
[3:58:20] <tanarath> BIG JUMP
[3:58:21] <+MisterAvry> You're Kirby now
[3:58:22] <%zarkazeon> you can now get purple suit
[3:58:24] <marvel877> FOREVER JUMP
[3:58:24] <%Nekros4442> Just jump forever
[3:58:25] <Asuterisuku> You can fly now.
[3:58:26] <+Shadow_Fenrir24> dat sound and music que
[3:58:26] <akitanito> vertical map opened
[3:58:26] <$OfficerMods> would have been cooler if he did the.. skip like woolie..
[3:58:27] <fairore> my dumass never use the storm misses had much rougher fight
[3:58:28] <@GeneralSCPatton> INFINIJUMP
[3:58:29] <$Jaxnos> now double on your double on your double
[3:58:29] <%AncelDeLambert> but not the BIGGEST jumpy
[3:58:30] <+Grayhammatter> infinite jumpies
[3:58:31] <+Slattsquatch> FUCK YOU SPIN BOOST
[3:58:32] <%dekkitout> Jump 2: More Jump
[3:58:32] <californaya> NOW WE METROID
[3:58:32] <Calamity2007> Infinite jump
[3:58:33] <%greasypete00> its really weird how they give you space jump like immediately after double jump
[3:58:34] <%DeepPix3l> Welcome to the space jam
[3:58:34] <%JoshManVGH> No jump in water but infinite jump otherwise
[3:58:34] <Nocturnment> wait you skipped the spin boost?
[3:58:35] <%ShinobiPhoenix> so you don't get that double jump long at all in this game
[3:58:38] <+Emperor_Z> It's funny how you get double jump, then two upgrades later you get infinite jump
[3:58:42] <+ReallyBigRocks> hmm
[3:58:44] <DeeVee_TV> Hmmst
[3:58:46] <%extradopeness> YOU HAVE SPACE JUMP
[3:58:46] <%TarikBot> Trapped forever
[3:58:47] <olaksi> baited
[3:58:50] <Onatamana> imagine if Samus had her full power canon moveset in smash.
[3:58:50] <+Grayhammatter> oh yeah, this one
[3:58:52] <%Issun135> a back door to space jump it seems
[3:58:53] <Louie_Salmon> Trolled
[3:58:54] <Bek_359> @Nocturnment Space Jump replaces Spin Boost
[3:58:57] <SaltyAzteca> Thats an exit
[3:58:58] <%Nekros4442> @Emperor_Z I'm sure the speed runners will find some way to sequence break it
[3:58:59] <+bugz_munny> now you're gonna starve
[3:59:05] <Blank9> woolie did this upgrade before storm missiles
[3:59:19] <+Grayhammatter> big trapped
[3:59:23] <Asuterisuku> That's a later item.
[3:59:23] <Calek> @Nekros4442 already have
[3:59:23] <+Emperor_Z> You can space jump underwater, you just can't gain height
[3:59:29] <hairtoday> you can jump forever in water
[3:59:30] <%scaryboisupreme> how the hell did woolie get this first
[3:59:33] <+gustavozxd> I wonder whaaaaaat you're supposed to use
[3:59:34] <%Issun135> learn to space jump under water
[3:59:35] <%Nekros4442> Welp there ya go lol
[3:59:36] <scarman125> I can't believe you never scanned that room
[3:59:39] <%ShinobiPhoenix> the entrance below letss you get the Space Jump Slightly earlyh
[3:59:40] <+ReallyBigRocks> the trappedest
[3:59:41] <$OfficerMods> no loser learn how to use the powerup
[3:59:41] <Blank9> he bomb jumped for half an hour
[3:59:41] <%ShinobiPhoenix> but not much
[3:59:43] <+MisterAvry> Wow there's a thing that just reveals blocks? What the fuck was David Jaffe doing then?
[3:59:44] <%Nekros4442> This game seems like it was designed for to be replayed and broken
[3:59:45] <+Rolandknight> time to learn space jump in water
[3:59:46] <Nocturnment> @bek_359 oh ok, I've been trying to speed run it so my brains all fucked with sequence breaks
[3:59:58] <akitanito> you destroyed your foothold tho
[4:00:04] <TheHotStuven> Bomb bouncing @scaryboisupreme
[4:00:17] <+Grayhammatter> this game already has speedruns
[4:00:17] <%athuramn> you can drop a bomb into those vortex like monsters for an instant ko
[4:00:21] <Calek> @MisterAvry you don't get this till way after where jaffe got stuck
[4:00:24] <+Emperor_Z> I also forgot I could fly in that moment
[4:00:31] <Calamity2007> @TheHotStuven Oh yeah I can see how
[4:00:37] <+bugz_munny> I mean there are a few sequence breaks but nothing game changing that would warrant an entire playthrough
[4:00:49] <+Shadow_Fenrir24> Elmo!!!!
[4:00:58] <DeeVee_TV> obliterated
[4:00:59] <akitanito> pfft
[4:00:59] <%zarkazeon> I did this one the hard way
[4:01:01] <Calamity2007> @bugz_munny Yet anyway
[4:01:06] <Asuterisuku> You stormed it instead of Icing it.
[4:01:06] <Blank9> can phase shift over, then go into ball midair
[4:01:07] <Onatamana> oops storm missiled it to death
[4:01:07] <%AncelDeLambert> Pat, it's so easy to turn into a morphball in the air and drop a bomb
[4:01:08] <%Bane_Kaikyo> lol
[4:01:08] <Explodincatz> why storm
[4:01:09] <+zoopbooploop> 5 missiles is more powerful than 1
[4:01:13] <%ShinobiPhoenix> I have 100% items and i don't remember that that iss
[4:01:16] <+McDerpus> you can go into morph ball mid air
[4:01:16] <%greasypete00> pat thats a bomb block
[4:01:19] <Bek_359> @bugz_munny There is that alternate Kraid kill method
[4:01:19] <+bugz_munny> What?
[4:01:20] <marvel877> You charged it, it became storm missiles instead of ice
[4:01:20] <%twohitgood> scan?
[4:01:26] <$OfficerMods> @MisterAvry you don't get it until this point in the game which is pretty late, i love this game but jaffee has a point some of these hidden blocks for progression are dirty. Remember the one in the entrance to catrina?
[4:01:26] <GenericSoda> enemy respawns are kind of fucky in this game
[4:01:26] <ToneBacas> almost
[4:01:29] <+gustavozxd> @shinobiphoenix me neither LUL
[4:01:31] <olaksi> skip samus over the water
[4:01:35] <SaltyAzteca> Theres an easy way to do this
[4:01:36] <%zarkazeon> grapple beam is a thing u have
[4:01:42] <+Grayhammatter> hm... don't remember this one either
[4:01:44] <marvel877> Press once for ice missile, charge for storm missiles
[4:01:45] <GenericSoda> I'm out, thanks for streaming!
[4:01:52] <%ShinobiPhoenix> maybe it was something from the other side
[4:01:53] <+bugz_munny> That's not worth an entire playthrough for lol
[4:02:01] <azure_dunes> LUL
[4:02:02] <%scaryboisupreme> Pat just blow that guy uo
[4:02:03] <akitanito> just kill that thing first
[4:02:04] <%scaryboisupreme> up
[4:02:05] <+ReallyBigRocks> oh shit, fire boosts
[4:02:06] <+bugz_munny> that's a "cool thing to see on youtube" at best
[4:02:06] <TwistParabola> ahh
[4:02:06] <%scaryboisupreme> yeh
[4:02:07] <olaksi> maybe kill the enemy first LUL
[4:02:08] <nickdooody> damage boost strat it might pay off
[4:02:14] <+megaman_sentinel> just kill it
[4:02:16] <+Grayhammatter> you fool
[4:02:19] <Kaji04> this is great
[4:02:19] <+Emperor_Z> Further and further down the pit
[4:02:24] <+MisterAvry> @OfficerMods I dunno, I watched like a dozen other people figure that out right away sooo
[4:02:24] <mike2hands> NotLikeThis
[4:02:29] <%extradopeness> LUL
[4:02:31] <miabyte> this is amazing
[4:02:31] <%bravebravesrobin> qa
[4:02:40] <%scaryboisupreme> Nice let's play
[4:02:43] <+gustavozxd> @bugz_munny what would be worth "an entire playthrough"?
[4:02:55] <Asuterisuku> Pat sounds like his dog.
[4:02:55] <+Shadow_Fenrir24> Kreygasm Kreygasm
[4:02:55] <%Ne1son> Nothing loses more time than trying to save time
[4:02:56] <+ReallyBigRocks> gamer
[4:03:01] <%Buzzard42> yeeee
[4:03:02] <nickdooody> LUL
[4:03:02] <+bugz_munny> Something that changes the story, gives new content, more bosses etc
[4:03:06] <+gustavozxd> oh yeah this will be nothing
[4:03:12] <+bugz_munny> an alternative death animation? hard pass
[4:03:26] <%Bane_Kaikyo> @PatStaresAt Sometimes it's ok to wait till you have the right upgrade and come back..... Nevermind, brute force it and sequence break if you want fuck me
[4:03:27] <+bugz_munny> there are way better ways to spend your time
[4:03:29] <ToneBacas> LUL
[4:03:30] <akitanito> this is the exit?
[4:03:31] <+Pachi3000> somewhere
[4:03:32] <+MisterAvry> it's goin
[4:03:34] <%Buzzard42> SOMEWHERE
[4:03:35] <+Emperor_Z> Is he doing this area backwards?
[4:03:38] <+Grayhammatter> away from that power up clearly
[4:03:43] <jorniev> SOME
[4:03:44] <jorniev> WHERE
[4:03:45] <ToneBacas> don't break the game, Pat
[4:03:48] <Nocturnment> s e c r e t
[4:03:50] <%SharkMissile> SharkMissile subscribed at Tier 1. They've subscribed for 22 months! It's my birthday, so watching Pat play a new Metroid game is like a gift
[4:03:50] <nickdooody> that would be hilarious
[4:03:52] <+Emperor_Z> I can't remember this part at all
[4:03:59] <+gustavozxd> @bugz_munny idk fun was a pretty good reason I had
[4:04:03] <$OfficerMods> @misteravry its not alot of people figuring it out its about the few who don't accidently shoot the ceiling and aren't aware that in metroid blocks are lies. It's a minor thing and i think he is blowign it a bit out of proportion but he still has a point, that early in the game a more clear crack would help
[4:04:05] <+Grayhammatter> LUL
[4:04:08] <akitanito> space jump
[4:04:10] <ChannelWad> HAP
[4:04:12] <%greasypete00> you need something you dont have for this one
[4:04:12] <Saltmeisterr> u can't do this yet
[4:04:12] <+bugz_munny> That's valid?
[4:04:13] <SForlord> Did you look at the Potemkin changes at all?
[4:04:13] <Asuterisuku> This one's a big ol' Later.
[4:04:14] <%Buzzard42> KEKW
[4:04:15] <+Grayhammatter> later item for sure
[4:04:16] <+tomdwarf> Remember, you have infinite jump
[4:04:18] <%silvery_cricket> bomb jump
[4:04:19] <%zarkazeon> ull want an upgrade for this one
[4:04:19] <%DeepPix3l> Did he just completely miss the power up before? psaBlind
[4:04:20] <+Emperor_Z> I think you got into this sub-area through the exit
[4:04:21] <+bugz_munny> Im glad you had fun
[4:04:27] <+zoopbooploop> I got this without the item that makes it easier
[4:04:29] <%X2Eliah> jump good
[4:04:33] <%AncelDeLambert> no cross?
[4:04:33] <nickdooody> awesome
[4:04:42] <+bugz_munny> But dont pretend a death animation is a compelling reason for another playthrough of this game
[4:04:44] <%scaryboisupreme> The game literally tells you to just shoot around if you can't figure it out
[4:04:46] <+ReallyBigRocks> damn
[4:04:47] <zentzen> you cant do this one yet
[4:04:48] <+uberspeedster> This is easier with a later item
[4:04:51] <$OfficerMods> room isn't flashing it's actually imposible
[4:04:53] <+Grayhammatter> big old later pat
[4:04:54] <%shootbang_exe> missing an upgrade
[4:04:56] <%AncelDeLambert> Time Skip
[4:04:56] <marvel877> need an item for that one.
[4:04:57] <%ShinobiPhoenix> I think I went the opposite way and had a certain upgrade by this point
[4:04:57] <+trizetacannon44> Time stop make this way easier
[4:05:00] <+Pachi3000> pretty sure this is impossible right now
[4:05:03] <+megaman_sentinel> u cant
[4:05:05] <+SolidusRex> Come back when you have a new powerup
[4:05:06] <+bugz_munny> need time stop pat
[4:05:12] <+gustavozxd> @bugz_munny no one's pretending anything man it's just a neat thing
[4:05:12] <Asuterisuku> Honestly I just power bombed that one.
[4:05:12] <+zoopbooploop> I got it without the thing that makes it super easy using bombjumping
[4:05:14] <Faithless_Zealot> ok, but just do it tho
[4:05:19] <zentzen> not yet
[4:05:20] <+Pachi3000> oh boy
[4:05:36] <+Grayhammatter> oh, this one
[4:05:39] <%AncelDeLambert> oh boy, THIS one
[4:05:41] <+Pachi3000> here we go again
[4:05:42] <%Buzzard42> SPEEEEEED
[4:05:43] <+SilverDevilfish> LUL
[4:05:44] <Asuterisuku> LUL
[4:05:44] <%greasypete00> its an other cool one
[4:05:45] <+MisterAvry> hehehe
[4:05:45] <%Buzzard42> this one's easy
[4:05:47] <+Grayhammatter> good fucking luck
[4:05:48] <Tham1k> Big puzzles
[4:05:49] <+MisterAvry> strap in folks
[4:05:49] <%Buzzard42> they're all easy
[4:05:50] <Asuterisuku> I like this one.
[4:05:52] <+gustavozxd> pat is going mega backwards here but I still don't remember what this place is
[4:05:53] <+zoopbooploop> ohhhhI love this one
[4:05:55] <+bugz_munny> someone asked what would justify a second playthrough of something in my mind, I responded. Thats all
[4:05:56] <Saltmeisterr> down pat
[4:05:56] <+Pachi3000> yeah it's not actually that hard
[4:05:56] <Blank9> mysteries
[4:05:59] <%ShinobiPhoenix> maybe keep going Pat and you'll find out
[4:06:00] <%zarkazeon> keep going down
[4:06:01] <+bugz_munny> This game doesnt have one besides itself
[4:06:02] <+McDerpus> this one is easy if you know the trick... the trick is knowing the trick
[4:06:07] <+Grayhammatter> down pat
[4:06:15] <%Buzzard42> every single shinespark puzzle in this game is easy compared to Fusion and Zero Mission's horseshit
[4:06:23] <%Piemono> Oh this one
[4:06:36] <Onatamana> Metroid Dread: Where the environment design is more likely to make you say 'fuck off' than any actual enemies in it.
[4:06:39] <%ShinobiPhoenix> a long flat surface
[4:06:40] <%scaryboisupreme> yeah the shinesparks aren't that difficult
[4:06:47] <%greasypete00> store shine
[4:06:48] <Tham1k> Oooh
[4:06:48] <%Dova573> Man there was a speed puzzle That i solve in a way harder way than it wa supposed to be
[4:06:49] <%Buzzard42> GET GOOD
[4:06:49] <%ShinobiPhoenix> you stopped early
[4:06:51] <SaltyAzteca> Remember Pat, shinespark on inclines to reset your speed boost @PatStaresAt
[4:06:51] <%RetroCop87> Pat, any interest in trying Super with the Fusion physics patch and widescreen?
[4:06:52] <%Buzzard42> MOTHERFUCKER
[4:06:53] <+Emperor_Z> Just store it and go up at normal speed
[4:06:53] <ammobasket> Storage?
[4:06:53] <DeeVee_TV> store it you nerd
[4:06:54] <nickdooody> gotta store that spark then go through
[4:06:55] <$SGrim> @PatStaresAt getting good
[4:06:56] <%ShinobiPhoenix> right rhere, charge
[4:06:56] <%AncelDeLambert> want a hint?
[4:06:57] <Blank9> if you spark into a ramp, you go straight into speed booster again
[4:06:57] <Asuterisuku> Store before jumping, then shine into the slope.
[4:06:58] <+supersonic21> oh this uses the hidden shinespark mechanic doesnt it
[4:06:58] <+Grayhammatter> it's easy actually, store the shine
[4:06:58] <+Pachi3000> Yeah, so thhere's a thing about shine spark storage....
[4:06:59] <+zoopbooploop> This was the first Shinespark puzzle I completed
[4:07:00] <+trizetacannon44> Save the shirespark then do it
[4:07:00] <%zarkazeon> purple
[4:07:00] <%scaryboisupreme> Pause, climb through, jump in mid air and run up the other ramp
[4:07:01] <nickdooody> then start it again
[4:07:01] <miabyte> store it
[4:07:03] <%Piemono> This you can certainly do
[4:07:03] <+criticalink_> I believe in you
[4:07:04] <Faithless_Zealot> just get throught it! 4Head
[4:07:05] <tanarath> Store it?
[4:07:07] <Saltmeisterr> @SaltyAzteca THIS
[4:07:13] <TwistParabola> do you need to do a diagonal morph ball spark here?
[4:07:15] <+Pachi3000> It's easy, except the game never tells you to do this
[4:07:15] <%TheLemuroid> Store, ball, release onto ramp
[4:07:16] <%twohitgood> omise
[4:07:17] <zentzen> store it
[4:07:19] <%AncelDeLambert> oh, nice try
[4:07:20] <+Pachi3000> Or that you can
[4:07:22] <%ShinobiPhoenix> where to store is as important as how
[4:07:22] <%TheWinged7> @PatStaresAt heavenly pot buster was buffed, extra range
[4:07:23] <akitanito> why aren't you storing it instead?
[4:07:27] <%silvery_cricket> WELCOME TO METROID
[4:07:29] <Psykoknight65> you gotta store it
[4:07:32] <%AncelDeLambert> he almost has it
[4:07:36] <ToneBacas> you got it
[4:07:37] <+JonathLP> Diagonal shinespark
[4:07:38] <%ShinobiPhoenix> and there is the whole thing
[4:07:39] <%twohitgood> you almost had it
[4:07:40] <$OfficerMods> just do it perfect
[4:07:41] <%ShinobiPhoenix> just DO it now
[4:07:42] <Roglef> you have space jump now
[4:07:43] <nickdooody> shine spark into the slope up top and it'll repeat the speedboost
[4:07:44] <$SGrim> Become super metroid, Pat
[4:07:44] <%AncelDeLambert> @PatStaresAt there's a shinespark trick you don't know
[4:07:47] <Calek> FIRMLY GRASP IT
[4:07:47] <+bugz_munny> Release it into the ramp
[4:07:48] <tanarath> kill everything first or....
[4:07:48] <+D00msDayDan> shinespark into the ramp
[4:07:50] <redwidow1358> You can shoot yourself at ramps to continue running, this resets the timer.
[4:07:50] <+zoopbooploop> Just hold down
[4:07:52] <Blank9> spark into an incline makes you run again
[4:07:53] <+bugz_munny> and then store it
[4:07:53] <%TheLemuroid> Release onto slope lets you run again
[4:07:53] <%twistedj3ster> Yeah, the ability you have here is never explained
[4:07:53] <pi_in_the_sci> diagonal spark
[4:07:54] <$OfficerMods> neutral jump then direction
[4:07:55] <%Issun135> Y+B in the air for ari shine spark
[4:07:56] <%ShinobiPhoenix> you don't have to diagonal but sure
[4:08:01] <marvel877> Shinesparks can be used on ramps.
[4:08:01] <%scaryboisupreme> If you jump in mid air, and don't press ANY direction, then jump again you can do it in mid air
[4:08:02] <+Emperor_Z> If you spark into a slope like those, you'll transition back into a run
[4:08:09] <miabyte> @patstaresat ramps reset your run so you can store again
[4:08:10] <%Dova573> btw the game dosent tell you this but shinessparking into a ramp resets your run
[4:08:11] <+bugz_munny> Shinespark into the ramp up - it will continue your run
[4:08:20] <+Pachi3000> I think it's actually dumb the game never tells you about ramps
[4:08:27] <%AncelDeLambert> shine into the ramp
[4:08:27] <olaksi> store, jump to ledge, diagonal?
[4:08:28] <+bugz_munny> Shinespark into a ramp
[4:08:28] <DeeVee_TV> try shine sparking int oa ramp[
[4:08:31] <that_guy_from_high_school> use it on the second ramp so it shoots you up?
[4:08:31] <+bugz_munny> mid air
[4:08:31] <+Pachi3000> Release the shine spark onto a ramp
[4:08:31] <%Buzzard42> try shinesparking a ramp
[4:08:32] <%bevyrage> just store it before the first ramp and try it out
[4:08:32] <%Niney_Who> If you shinespark into a Ramp you resume Speed boosting, it's never shown
[4:08:32] <+McDerpus> shine spark into that first ramp
[4:08:33] <%greasypete00> if you spark into a ramp it makles you run again
[4:08:35] <Asuterisuku> Oh no Pat didn't play Zero Mission so he never learned this.
[4:08:36] <%scaryboisupreme> Running up a hill will put you back in the running state if you hit them when shinesparking
[4:08:36] <Blank9> if you do the shoulder tackle into a ramp, you run on it
[4:08:37] <+Emperor_Z> If you shinespark into a ramp, you'll stand running again
[4:08:38] <%Buzzard42> no
[4:08:40] <%AncelDeLambert> no, INTO the ramp
[4:08:41] <%Niney_Who> Except for like 1-2 puzzles
[4:08:41] <+Pachi3000> Like, into the ramp, not along the ramp
[4:08:41] <%Buzzard42> INTO the ramp
[4:08:41] <%bevyrage> shine spark into the ramp horizontally
[4:08:41] <Saltmeisterr> store then shinspark into a ramp
[4:08:42] <%TheHateFish> Into, not along
[4:08:43] <+bugz_munny> into it
[4:08:43] <+gustavozxd> head first into the ramp
[4:08:44] <%zarkazeon> run. purple. into ramp
[4:08:44] <%TheLemuroid> Release horizontally onto a slope
[4:08:44] <ToneBacas> if you store and spark towards ramps you keep running i think
[4:08:45] <%Dova573> into ramp
[4:08:45] <$OfficerMods> horizontial
[4:08:45] <zentzen> store it
[4:08:46] <+Double_Tap_That> Shinesparking into a ramp transitions into a speedboost
[4:08:49] <+criticalink_> if you shinespark into a ramp, it'll put you back in speedboost run mode instead of flying
[4:08:51] <marvel877> INTO the ramp
[4:08:51] <+bugz_munny> like shoulder tackle a ramp
[4:08:52] <Onatamana> @PatStaresAt shinesparing into a ramp puts you back into speed boost run state
[4:08:52] <SaltyAzteca> @PatStaresAt Store shinespark at the ramp, then dash towards ramp
[4:08:55] <+tomdwarf> Its for the second part, after the morph ball corridor
[4:08:56] <Kaji04> doing the purple into ramp resumes dash
[4:08:58] <+Emperor_Z> Jump and spark into the ramp
[4:09:00] <%Agami23> shinespark horizontally into a ramp
[4:09:00] <%Niney_Who> @PatStaresAt If you Shinespark horizontally into a ramp, you resume SpeeD boosting instead of losing it
[4:09:00] <+Pachi3000> No no, jump up and then release INTO the ramp
[4:09:00] <+Dreshura> You have to shinespark straight into the ramp like \ <-
[4:09:00] <%crimsonharvest> if you hit the ramp while flying uncontrollably you'll regain your feet and keep running at speed
[4:09:00] <%notsoy> shinespark INTO the ramp at an angle
[4:09:00] <$OfficerMods> jump higher this time silly
[4:09:02] <+bugz_munny> INTO the ramp
[4:09:02] <+D00msDayDan> horizontal shinespark into a ramp
[4:09:02] <%ShinobiPhoenix> @PatStaresAt ramp reset a Shinespark BACK into a boost run to then do another Shinespark later
[4:09:08] <Onjani> --> /
[4:09:09] <redwidow1358> If you jump, then shoot in the air to straighten yourself, immediately hit jump, it fires the spark in the air, then go horizontally into the ramp and hold that direction.
[4:09:09] <%ShinobiPhoenix> but you don't actually need it for this
[4:09:09] <+Emperor_Z> That works I guess
[4:09:10] <%scaryboisupreme> lmao
[4:09:11] <+Pachi3000> INTO
[4:09:11] <+gustavozxd> that works too
[4:09:12] <%ForlornCarton> If you shinespark directly into a ramp, you start running up it
[4:09:12] <$OfficerMods> ha ha you thought
[4:09:13] <+Pachi3000> not ALONG
[4:09:13] <DeeVee_TV> Jebaited
[4:09:13] <+Emperor_Z> Or not
[4:09:14] <miabyte> if you go purple, hit a ramp, then it will turn you back blue, continue running and you can store into purple again
[4:09:16] <%mostbrokenrobo> horizontal not diagonal
[4:09:16] <TwistParabola> pain
[4:09:16] <%Buzzard42> THAT WORKS TOO
[4:09:17] <$OfficerMods> it doesn't work
[4:09:17] <akitanito> did it early
[4:09:18] <+Grayhammatter> almost
[4:09:19] <%Buzzard42> OR
[4:09:20] <SaltyAzteca> DO IT RIGHT
[4:09:22] <%Buzzard42> NOT
[4:09:23] <+gustavozxd> oh wait LUL
[4:09:24] <%TheLemuroid> Store, jump, release horizontal into ramp, store again
[4:09:24] <ToneBacas> has to be a proper vertical spark
[4:09:25] <+Pachi3000> This doesn't work
[4:09:27] <marvel877> Close, but not exact Pat.
[4:09:27] <+bugz_munny> INTO the ramp LUL
[4:09:29] <Blank9> if you do a spin jump, you can fire to go into neutral, then jump + direction to spark
[4:09:29] <%bevyrage> store, jump, shine spark into ramp from a platform that puts you horizontally into the ramp, lets you run again
[4:09:29] <+gustavozxd> Jebaited
[4:09:30] <+JonathLP> Shinespark into the ramp like this: ---->/ and you resume your run
[4:09:31] <$SGrim> Agane
[4:09:31] <SaltyAzteca> NO THAT DOESNT WORK, DO IT AGAIN LUL
[4:09:34] <+Grayhammatter> gotta do it right
[4:09:35] <%scaryboisupreme> the biggest L
[4:09:36] <+bugz_munny> You keep doing it to the side
[4:09:36] <+tomdwarf> You dont shine spark along it pat. You have to spark into it, like a wall.
[4:09:37] <olaksi> oh no the game knows
[4:09:42] <+Pachi3000> INTO
[4:09:43] <marvel877> You are
[4:09:44] <+Evendrag> you almost had it, just shinespark up there
[4:09:45] <KaeporaGaepora> you can activate the shine spark while in the air, if you aim into the ramp you can store it at the top
[4:09:46] <Roglef> jump and Y+B for an air spark into the ramp
[4:09:46] <+Pachi3000> INTO THE RAMP
[4:09:46] <%blastyoboots> Shinespark up LEFT ramp, store, then shinespark HORIZONTALLY into RIGHT ramp
[4:09:48] <Saladpoke> ———>/
[4:09:48] <%ShinobiPhoenix> what chat is suggesting is more complicated than simply Space jumping OVER the ramp
[4:09:48] <%Agami23> you can shinespark mid air i think
[4:09:49] <Kaji04> just jump towards it
[4:09:49] <SaltyAzteca> Dash INTO the ramp
[4:09:49] <%AncelDeLambert> While Space Jumping, you can press Y and B to Shinespark in any direction
[4:09:50] <%greasypete00> shine so you hit the ramp head on and it lets you run again
[4:09:50] <JTEIO> horizontal into ramp
[4:09:51] <scarman125> INTO
[4:09:51] <+zuzuxiv> B+Y while in air to shinespark after jump
[4:09:51] <+zoopbooploop> You can just space jump there, then up
[4:09:51] <%mostbrokenrobo> JUMP + HORIZONTAL
[4:09:51] <%silvery_cricket> Shine spark at the top of the ramp
[4:09:52] <+bugz_munny> You're hitting everything but the ramp LUL
[4:09:52] <%notsoy> don't shoot it at the same angle as the ramp, shoot it INTO the ramp, like you're trying to punch through
[4:09:53] <%Niney_Who> Spark into the ramp Horizontally
[4:09:53] <+tomdwarf> So hard right, not diagonal up right
[4:09:53] <+NickHatesSnow> Not the diagonal shine horitontal
[4:09:54] <%scaryboisupreme> Why not stand on the platform and shinespark into the ramp
[4:09:54] <+itslapdog> Horizontally into ramp!
[4:09:54] <Saltmeisterr> INTO the ramp
[4:09:55] <%bevyrage> PAT JUST JUMP LEFT THEN SHINE SPARK TO THE RIGHT INTO THE RAMP
[4:09:55] <%zarkazeon> get 9n flat platform
[4:09:56] <Onatamana> diagonal shinespark is not the solution here
[4:09:59] <gygias10> spin jump to keep the shinspark
[4:09:59] <+criticalink_> shinespark from the platform to the left of the 2nd ramp
[4:09:59] <Jakeawienas> you have to hit in a cardinal direction
[4:09:59] <Onjani> Into the ram --> /
[4:10:02] <%silvery_cricket> shine spark at the top of the second ramp
[4:10:05] <Kaji04> lol
[4:10:06] <+bugz_munny> SHINESPARK INTO THE RAMP
[4:10:07] <$OfficerMods> the shine spark puzzles in this game is the embodiment of "OH YOU THOUGHT"
[4:10:08] <+Pachi3000> Shinespark into the ramp, not along the ramp
[4:10:09] <+bugz_munny> HOLY CRAP
[4:10:09] <Asuterisuku> Or you can jump up onto the platform to the left THEN spark right.
[4:10:12] <+gustavozxd> you can shine spark in the air if you forward jump and then melee and then neutral jump @patstaresat
[4:10:13] <%Niney_Who> Yeah you gotta shoot in Mid-air to be able to shinespark
[4:10:14] <+AntithesisEK> smash your face into the slope
[4:10:16] <%ShinobiPhoenix> they are suggesting Shinesparking UP the ramp and then stop AND storing again
[4:10:18] <+Emperor_Z> 1. You can shinespark in mid-air. 2. Shinesparking into a ramp transitions you back into a speed boost
[4:10:19] <+zoopbooploop> Diagonal Shinespark isn't the solution
[4:10:19] <+NickHatesSnow> HEADBUTT THE RAMP
[4:10:21] <%scaryboisupreme> Shoot to cancel the spin
[4:10:22] <zentzen> shinespark into the ramp
[4:10:23] <TheHotStuven> shooting cancels spin jump
[4:10:24] <+rorschachsjournal505> Into the ramp, like it the ramp itself with the shinespark
[4:10:25] <%DeepPix3l> Spark Horizontally into the slope
[4:10:25] <+Double_Tap_That> You want to shinespark horizontally into the ramp to speed boost.
[4:10:26] <Blank9> shoot gets you out of flipping into neutral stance
[4:10:27] <%Bane_Kaikyo> no
[4:10:27] <%TheHateFish> Horizontal shine into the diagonal ramp
[4:10:27] <+Pachi3000> In order to shinespark middair
[4:10:28] <%zarkazeon> get on the other flat platform
[4:10:28] <Asuterisuku> Shooting cancels your somersault animation.
[4:10:28] <Roglef> store then y+b in air
[4:10:28] <%SaiyanShoto> Y and B together let you shinespark in the air
[4:10:29] <hydragoon513> If you hit the ramp you can speed boost again.
[4:10:30] <%Agami23> you have to not be in a spin jump
[4:10:30] <%Buzzard42> just try
[4:10:32] <%AncelDeLambert> Store it, then you can shine while space jumping
[4:10:33] <Tham1k> one guy
[4:10:33] <%ForlornCarton> Shooting puts your jump to neutral
[4:10:35] <%scaryboisupreme> You can't shinespark if you're doing the spin jump
[4:10:38] <%twistedj3ster> watching a video of it made it click for me
[4:10:38] <+JonathLP> Shinespark from the air into the ramp like ramming into the floor
[4:10:38] <+McDerpus> if you press b while moving with shinespark stored, you jump instead of shinespark
[4:10:38] <%twohitgood> if you shinespark horizontally into the slope of the ramp, you'll be running again when you hit flat land again.
[4:10:39] <Kaji04> Purple into ramp resumes run
[4:10:40] <%Issun135> you cancel the shot in to a shine spark
[4:10:40] <+transporterthesequel> Chat you're devolving
[4:10:42] <%SaphronBlackbourne> You can't shinesprak while spinning, shooting stop you from spinning
[4:10:42] <+supersonic21> shinesparking into the ramp resets boost run and lets you reset shinespark
[4:10:43] <+NickHatesSnow> just do it tho
[4:10:44] <%notsoy> \  \      <---shinespark   \
[4:10:45] <%RealThiele> WTF one chat holy shit
[4:10:45] <inouye> when you are purple you can use y+b in the air to shinespark
[4:10:46] <%silvery_cricket> FLOOP THE FLORP PAT
[4:10:47] <+ReallyBigRocks> :)
[4:10:47] <Onjani> Only if you're spin jumping
[4:10:49] <%bevyrage> pat you gotta remember that into does not mean 'along side'
[4:10:51] <+Katashi25> can you space jump while purple charge?
[4:10:52] <%mostbrokenrobo> You are sparking DIAGONALLY you need to do it HORIZONTAL
[4:10:53] <%ShinobiPhoenix> Spin Jump to keep from activating the Spark
[4:10:54] <KaeporaGaepora> you can  space jump with a stored shine spark but you have to shoot to exit space jump
[4:10:54] <+gustavozxd> forward jump
[4:10:55] <Kaji04> Spin jump to keep it
[4:10:55] <%ToadKing> people are trying to explain three different methods to pat at the same time
[4:10:58] <%AncelDeLambert> so hold left and you'll space jump instead of shine
[4:10:58] <+bugz_munny> Shine spark into a ramp continues your ramp. Youve been shinesparking diagonally
[4:10:59] <KaeporaGaepora> then you can shine spark
[4:10:59] <+Emperor_Z> You can shinespark in midair, but not if you're spinning, so you have to shoot first
[4:11:00] <+DeaconBluesClues> I think they're saying you're want to shine park in the ramp at a 90 degreed/perpendicular angle, i.e. like crossing the letter T
[4:11:00] <%scaryboisupreme> if you're putting in a direction it won't activate the shinespark
[4:11:01] <Ukokira> Oh lord
[4:11:02] <+rorschachsjournal505> Chat you are making this one harder than it is. Lol
[4:11:03] <%TheHateFish> Y + B to jump then shine
[4:11:03] <%Niney_Who> @PatStaresAt If you're spinning you can't shinespark mid-air. You have to be moving and Jump, shoot mid-air, hit it horizontally.
[4:11:03] <+NickHatesSnow> You do the diagonal shinespark not horizontal
[4:11:04] <+ReallyBigRocks> all you have to do to win game is this
[4:11:04] <$OfficerMods> is shine sparking a cult?
[4:11:05] <spinningchurro> PROTIP: to defeat the cyberdemon, shoot at it until it dies.
[4:11:07] <%Buzzard42> you can't shinespark during a spin jump, shooting takes you ot of spin jump
[4:11:07] <%cvp5127> space jump doest use it
[4:11:08] <redwidow1358> You have to spin jump up, then shoot plus jump button to activate it in the air
[4:11:13] <%Andrizzleton> there you go
[4:11:14] <%Buzzard42> close
[4:11:14] <Asuterisuku> That almost worked lol
[4:11:15] <+criticalink_> shinespark from the horizontal platform to the left of the second ramp
[4:11:15] <+Grayhammatter> almost
[4:11:16] <+gustavozxd> you did it right there
[4:11:16] <%ForlornCarton> You can jump while storing a shinespark if you are moving
[4:11:17] <+tomdwarf> You had it. Thatll work
[4:11:17] <+transporterthesequel> Oh into the SECOND RAMP
[4:11:19] <%silvery_cricket> almost had it that time
[4:11:19] <olaksi> that was close
[4:11:20] <+zuzuxiv> when you have a shine stored, and you jump forward, press B+Y at the same time
[4:11:23] <Faithless_Zealot> close
[4:11:23] <%Andrizzleton> you had it there
[4:11:23] <%TheHateFish> Or just do whatever you just did
[4:11:24] <+transporterthesequel> Shinespark into the SECOND RAMP
[4:11:25] <+DeaconBluesClues> @bugz_munny so you're saying the input is 4 or 6, rather than 7 or 9
[4:11:26] <+bugz_munny> SHINESPARK INTO RAMP
[4:11:29] <+bugz_munny> THATS IT
[4:11:30] <%scaryboisupreme> So I can explain it
[4:11:30] <%Niney_Who> It makes you not spin
[4:11:31] <%Monkeyweed21> TEST IT
[4:11:33] <+transporterthesequel> Nothing
[4:11:33] <JTEIO> horizontal into the ramp
[4:11:33] <+Evendrag> just shinespark all the way up
[4:11:34] <%Andrizzleton> you don't have to shoot
[4:11:35] <Ukokira> Oh I see what’s happening
[4:11:35] <Visorak6> shoot cancels spin jump
[4:11:35] <Kaji04> You have two regular jumps, neutral jump activates spark, spinning doesn't.
[4:11:35] <+JonathLP> Ram into the ramp with shinespark
[4:11:35] <Blank9> the shoot cancels your spinning jump
[4:11:36] <+Take_2_shots> shooting neutralizes your stance
[4:11:36] <Asuterisuku> Shooting cancels your spin jump animation and lets you shinespark.
[4:11:36] <%Niney_Who> So you can shinespark mid-air
[4:11:37] <gygias10> try in this rrom
[4:11:38] <$OfficerMods> shooting stops spin
[4:11:40] <+Emperor_Z> Shoot cancels the spin. You cant shinespark if youre spinning
[4:11:40] <+Paronoma> shooting takes you out of spin jump
[4:11:40] <%cvp5127> it resets you
[4:11:41] <brachydios777> What's the most recent boss Pat fought?
[4:11:41] <ToneBacas> to get out of spin jump. Samus can't spark during spin jumps
[4:11:42] <KaeporaGaepora> if youre spin jumping you cant shine spark, shooting makes you neutral jump so you can
[4:11:42] <%TheWinged7> JUST DIG UP psaGoblin
[4:11:42] <Roglef> so if you are space jumping, shinespark doesn't work in the air, but if you y+b it will do it
[4:11:42] <+Pachi3000> Y+B to cancel the spin jump, because you can't shinespark while spin jumping. That's how you shinespark middair
[4:11:43] <+Rolandknight> it stop your spin when you shoot
[4:11:44] <%JoshManVGH> Press both the shoot and jump button at the same time
[4:11:45] <+McDerpus> when you are in sumersault, you can't shinespark, shooting puts you out of sumersault
[4:11:45] <+gustavozxd> to reset your position from spin jumping
[4:11:45] <%Buzzard42> Shooting takes you out of the spinjump animation, letting you activate shinespark in midair
[4:11:45] <$OfficerMods> it stops spin
[4:11:46] <+trizetacannon44> Cant Shinspark is spinning!
[4:11:46] <%greasypete00> shooting puts you into a neutral state in the air where you can shine from, still in mid air
[4:11:47] <%Agami23> pat, if your jump is spinning you cant spark
[4:11:47] <+D00msDayDan> push the shoot and jump button at the same time to shinespark while you are in the air
[4:11:47] <Explodincatz> shoot stop spinning
[4:11:48] <%Monkeyweed21> IT STOPS YOU FROM SPINNING
[4:11:48] <%scaryboisupreme> You can't be holding a direction input when you're in mid air
[4:11:49] <%Piemono> I didn't get this until I saw a video of someone doing it
[4:11:49] <pi_in_the_sci> shooting resets you out of spin jump, so you can shinespark
[4:11:49] <%retrohazard> it resets your spin/motion so you can trigger the spark
[4:11:49] <%TheLemuroid> If you jump forward it spin jumps you. Shoot to stop the summersalt
[4:11:49] <hydragoon513> Shooting lets you cancel a spin jump and do a shinespark.
[4:11:50] <%Bane_Kaikyo> It's times like these that I wish he had a designated "Chat translator" that could hop in voice chat
[4:11:51] <+bugz_munny> LEFT OR RIGHT INTO THE RAMP IN MID AIR
[4:11:51] <Saltmeisterr> u can't shinespark while in spin jump
[4:11:52] <%ForlornCarton> If you are spinning in the air while holding a shinespark, it will activate
[4:11:52] <+criticalink_> ignore that advice; shinespark from the platform to the left of the 2nd ramp
[4:11:52] <%Buzzard42> you can't shinespark during a spinjump
[4:11:52] <%zarkazeon> dude all u have to do with this one is jump to the other platform
[4:11:52] <%JoshManVGH> When you have shinespark
[4:11:52] <%AncelDeLambert> @PatStaresAt if you hold a direction while jumping, then you won't use your shinespark charge. If you press shoot AND jump at the same time then, you'll shinespark
[4:11:53] <+tomdwarf> Noticed how you werent doing a ball spin in air when you shot? Thats the part you want
[4:11:54] <@GeneralSCPatton> SHOOTING EXITS THE SPIN
[4:11:54] <+bugz_munny> WITH A SHINE SPARK
[4:11:54] <%extradopeness> it cancelss the spin jump you cant shinespark out of spin jump
[4:11:54] <omnishadeee> when u shoot in midair it cancels spinjump. u can only shinespark from standing jump
[4:11:54] <Asuterisuku> Plink it, Y, THEN B.
[4:11:55] <%Niney_Who> Yeah see
[4:11:57] <%Niney_Who> It's awful yeah
[4:11:57] <spinningchurro> Dogs can’t look up Pat.
[4:11:59] <Saltmeisterr> only neutral jump
[4:11:59] <%Dova573> shoot cancels spin so then you can shinespark
[4:11:59] <+Pachi3000> shooting cancels your spin
[4:12:00] <+tomdwarf> It lets you shine spark mid air
[4:12:00] <Onjani> That only matters if you are in the spin jump animation
[4:12:01] <KaeporaGaepora> you did it!
[4:12:03] <+zuzuxiv> LMFAO
[4:12:03] <%twistedj3ster> Yeah it's not great
[4:12:03] <%greasypete00> thats not how you have to do this
[4:12:03] <%zarkazeon> then go across
[4:12:04] <%cvp5127> LUL
[4:12:08] <+zuzuxiv> IT IS INTENDED
[4:12:10] <Ukokira> Why are we giving shooting advice here for this puzzle
[4:12:13] <+criticalink_> shoot cancelling isn't necessary here
[4:12:14] <+DeaconBluesClues> @PatStaresAt I think they want you to do a 4 or 6 input (FGC numpad notation) instead of 7/9
[4:12:15] <miabyte> if you go purple, you can shinespark into a ramp and it will give you your blue run back and you can go purple again
[4:12:16] <%ShinobiPhoenix> they are saying it backwards.... SPIN Jump to move in the air and SHOOT while spinning ot cancel the Spin so you can then activate the Spark while in the air, but all os this is unnecessary for this
[4:12:16] <wqorst> just jump left omg
[4:12:17] <+gustavozxd> it's sick
[4:12:18] <%TheHateFish> YES
[4:12:19] <hydragoon513> It's not really intended.
[4:12:20] <+Emperor_Z> If you push Y and B at the same time, it will shinespark anyway as a convenience feature
[4:12:20] <+DeaconBluesClues> I think
[4:12:20] <%Agami23> thats classic.
[4:12:20] <DeeVee_TV> just stand on the left side and shine spark right
[4:12:20] <%Niney_Who> Worst part is you HAVE to do it a few times
[4:12:23] <Pylohn> SHOOTING STOPS THE SPIN JUMP!
[4:12:24] <%blastyoboots> Shinespark horizontally into the right ramp
[4:12:25] <+supersonic21> jump onto the slightly higher platform and shinespark into the ramp
[4:12:27] <%scaryboisupreme> once you get the hang of it it's still difficult lmao
[4:12:28] <%Buzzard42> shoot cancelling IS necessary elsewhere
[4:12:29] <Kaji04> To stop spinning in the air you can shoot.
[4:12:30] <SaltyAzteca> @PatStaresAt Store shinespark, then dash into ramp, horizontally
[4:12:32] <%ShinobiPhoenix> all you have to do is aht you were intending to do
[4:12:32] <%Issun135> the y+b is only for when you are spin jumping and want to shine spark
[4:12:33] <%TheLemuroid> The next thing to learn is that hitting the slope causes you to run again which let's you store a 2nd spark
[4:12:34] <+Evendrag> @PatStaresAt just land underneath and do a regular shinespark
[4:12:34] <%silvery_cricket> Shine spark vertically at the top of the second ramp to break through both set of boxes to get the missle
[4:12:34] <+zoopbooploop> Yeah, you can just jump up the ramp. Canceling isn't necessary
[4:12:35] <%SaiyanShoto> I didn't need to do that when I did this
[4:12:36] <+Pachi3000> There's actually an easier way, but the game literally doesn't explain it
[4:12:36] <%bevyrage> you can make this a metric fuckton easier on yourself if you just shine sparked from the platform on the right after you climb up
[4:12:38] <$OfficerMods> wrong direction
[4:12:39] <+TheSuperCharger> You can’t shine spark while you are jump spinning the shooting stops your jump spin
[4:12:39] <%Monkeyweed21> @PatStaresAt you can just jump to the left and shinespark from there into the ramp
[4:12:39] <+MaliciousHero> Be good, dont suck.
[4:12:40] <%Piemono> I've done this, and chat is making me more confused
[4:12:40] <%Agami23> horizontally
[4:12:40] <+Emperor_Z> Spark forward into the ramp, not down
[4:12:41] <+Dappercat> lol
[4:12:41] <scarman125> @PatStaresAt jump onto the left platform then shinespark
[4:12:42] <+bugz_munny> YOU WENT DOWN
[4:12:42] <pi_in_the_sci> no down, forward
[4:12:43] <+Paronoma> just jump from the left ledge
[4:12:43] <Asuterisuku> That wasn't horizontal.
[4:12:43] <+JonathLP> Hit it going right
[4:12:43] <+bugz_munny> DUMBASS
[4:12:44] <+McDerpus> shine spark horizontally into ramp
[4:12:45] <+tomdwarf> You shine sparked down. Not right
[4:12:45] <ToneBacas> horizontal, to the right
[4:12:45] <Roglef> you sparked down. spark horizontally
[4:12:46] <+NickHatesSnow> You Shinesparked down
[4:12:46] <JTEIO> horizontal
[4:12:47] <+gustavozxd> gotta be forward, oops
[4:12:47] <+rorschachsjournal505> Pat, if you spin jump you can’t shine spark, shooting resets you to neutral to do it. However you do not need to do it here at all, I have no idea why chat is telling you to do that.
[4:12:48] <+Dreshura> Shinespark horizontally, not downward
[4:12:48] <+rbakervv> horizatal sparkk yp[at
[4:12:48] <%criticalink_> criticalink_ subscribed with Prime. 
[4:12:48] <+JonathLP> Not down, right
[4:12:48] <+zuzuxiv> do it does, gotta hold right
[4:12:49] <%greasypete00> you have to shine HORIZONTALLY into the ramps
[4:12:49] <+ClickyButtons> you dont need to shoot you can just jump up, you almost had it
[4:12:49] <Visorak6> forward not down
[4:12:49] <KaeporaGaepora> aim to the right instead of down @PatStaresAt
[4:12:49] <%Dova573> fowars noy down
[4:12:49] <Saladpoke> I don’t think you even have to cancel, can’t you just space jump to get up ramp?
[4:12:50] <Saltmeisterr> HORIZONTALLY
[4:12:50] <%scaryboisupreme> nah you can pick a direction when you start the spark in midair
[4:12:51] <+supersonic21> just jump onto the slightly higher platform next to it and shinespark into it
[4:12:51] <Kaji04> Spark forward
[4:12:52] <%Bane_Kaikyo> ---->
[4:12:52] <%ForlornCarton> You don't need the "jump+shoot" technique to get this item
[4:12:53] <+DeaconBluesClues> USE NUMPAD NOTATION DAMNIT
[4:12:53] <TheHotStuven> Y + B
[4:12:55] <omnishadeee> bruh
[4:12:55] <%ShinobiPhoenix> running up the ramp, store the charge and jump OVER the second jump
[4:12:56] <%cvp5127> ?
[4:12:58] <DeeVee_TV> @PatStaresAt At the second ramp,  stand on the left and shinespark right, into the ramp
[4:12:58] <%bevyrage> shine spark from the platform on the left into the ramp on the right, i mean
[4:12:59] <%Issun135> store the spark and stand to the left of the ramp and spark toward the ramp
[4:12:59] <gygias10> shinespark into ramp then press down to store
[4:13:01] <+rorschachsjournal505> Horizontal Pat
[4:13:02] <%whyskeywolfe> Why does he keep leaving the rolm
[4:13:02] <TheHotStuven> Y + B and hold Right
[4:13:03] <%RealThiele> <--->
[4:13:04] <Saladpoke> Horizontal into ramp, not vergical
[4:13:04] <%Bane_Kaikyo> SPARK RIGHT -->
[4:13:05] <+Brrnugt> after going into a ball go to the left side and spark into the ramp
[4:13:06] <%Niney_Who> You can just jump up there instead and hit the spark straight up
[4:13:06] <@TheYellowcouch> I'm glad I don't know shit about metroid so I can just enjoy this fuckery
[4:13:06] <Asuterisuku> Spark right from the left hand platform.
[4:13:07] <Spudmeister9000> shot cancel is never necessary
[4:13:07] <redwidow1358> The problem is you need to spin jump to get up while holding the spark charge. You cannot spark in the air if you're spinning. Shooting cancels that animation. Then you can hit the jump to start sparking. You aim horizontally into a ramp and hold toward it to continue running up, which resets the charge and lets you store it again at the next flat surface.
[4:13:07] <+transporterthesequel> Yes you do
[4:13:08] <%extradopeness> LUL LUL LUL
[4:13:09] <%TheHateFish> @PatStaresAt You managed to run up there once, just do that again
[4:13:10] <%SaiyanShoto> you can just hit Y+B in the air to shinespark into the ramp, you don't need to shoot
[4:13:11] <Ukokira> Oh good lord
[4:13:11] <zentzen> jump into the platform on the left and shinespark
[4:13:14] <%greasypete00> that idea is probably the easiest way
[4:13:14] <%cvp5127> shinespark into the ramp
[4:13:17] <%Niney_Who> Yep that works
[4:13:17] <%scaryboisupreme> LMAO
[4:13:18] <%Buzzard42> YE
[4:13:20] <+Pachi3000> Did you see it?
[4:13:20] <+DeaconBluesClues> @PatStaresAt pretty sure they are akwardly saying it's a 4/6 inpit instead of 7/9/2 or whatever
[4:13:20] <+NickHatesSnow> FINALLY
[4:13:20] <SaltyAzteca> THATS IT
[4:13:20] <+bugz_munny> HOLY SHIT
[4:13:21] <+gustavozxd> there it iss
[4:13:21] <%Buzzard42> no
[4:13:21] <%scaryboisupreme> WHAT WAS THAT ANIMATION
[4:13:21] <+JonathLP> YES
[4:13:23] <+Pachi3000> Your run resumed
[4:13:23] <+ReallyBigRocks> and then
[4:13:23] <%TheLemuroid> Almost had it
[4:13:24] <%Buzzard42> LOL
[4:13:24] <mike2hands> WHUUT
[4:13:24] <%Agami23> that idea works
[4:13:24] <Blank9> that works
[4:13:24] <pi_in_the_sci> yeah, like that, but store it again
[4:13:25] <Tham1k> There it is
[4:13:25] <+supersonic21> you had it but wrong button
[4:13:25] <SaltyAzteca> DASH INTO RAMP
[4:13:25] <TwistParabola> he gets it
[4:13:26] <JTEIO> finally lol
[4:13:26] <+ReallyBigRocks> do thing
[4:13:26] <brachydios777> There we go
[4:13:26] <Saltmeisterr> YEAH SEE
[4:13:26] <+bugz_munny> SHINE SPARK
[4:13:26] <LoneFonte> NOW HE GETS IT
[4:13:27] <%criticalink_> that was a weird bug
[4:13:27] <+Take_2_shots> what?
[4:13:27] <%Dova573> lol
[4:13:27] <+transporterthesequel> UR RITE
[4:13:27] <%ForlornCarton> YES
[4:13:28] <+Geronimo9037> you have it
[4:13:28] <+pimenstrudel> TO SOOON
[4:13:28] <ToneBacas> at the top, store again
[4:13:28] <+Pachi3000> and you can store again
[4:13:28] <+megaman_sentinel> yea
[4:13:28] <+Emperor_Z> That works for this one, but there are other puzzles where it won't
[4:13:29] <%Issun135> ok that should have worked but it didnt????
[4:13:29] <%ToadKing> yeah ignore chat and do that
[4:13:29] <+Brrnugt> just like that
[4:13:29] <Kaji04> This ramp tech is for future reference btw
[4:13:29] <+bugz_munny> INTO RAMP
[4:13:29] <Roglef> like that then store again
[4:13:30] <%criticalink_> but that was the solution
[4:13:30] <%Agami23> now get the timing right
[4:13:30] <DeeVee_TV> Almost
[4:13:30] <Asuterisuku> That's what we were trying to tell you.
[4:13:31] <+JonathLP> HE SAW IT
[4:13:31] <+zuzuxiv> okay that's fair LOL
[4:13:32] <%greasypete00> thats literally the easiest thing to do idk what all the shoot in midair things are about
[4:13:33] <%Niney_Who> It resumes your Speed boost
[4:13:33] <+zoopbooploop> OH MY GOD YOU DID THE THING ALMOST
[4:13:33] <KaeporaGaepora> youre so cloes
[4:13:34] <+tomdwarf> That is what you need to do yeah. You immediately go into a shine run, and can store it again.
[4:13:35] <+Grayhammatter> what the fuck was that LUL
[4:13:36] <%Niney_Who> so you can Chain it
[4:13:36] <%RealThiele> tech
[4:13:38] <Onjani> Chat overcomplicating LUL
[4:13:41] <tanarath> He doesn't get it
[4:13:41] <olaksi> it didn't do anything though, chat
[4:13:41] <%TheLemuroid> The ramp let's you store a 2nd spark
[4:13:43] <wqorst> uh
[4:13:43] <SaltyAzteca> @PatStaresAt When you dash into the ramp it resets shinespark
[4:13:43] <Klarrann3> You don't need to do this complicated movement for this puzzle. You can just space jump into position and then jump up
[4:13:44] <%zarkazeon> that's what you were SUPPOSED to do
[4:13:44] <%Buzzard42> psaWrong
[4:13:44] <Syrushmx> shut up chat
[4:13:46] <+JonathLP> You can do it neo
[4:13:46] <+RobocopSanchez> lets go
[4:13:49] <+Pachi3000> THE GAME NEVER TELLS YOU ABOUT THIS
[4:13:51] <$OfficerMods> the ultimate goblin
[4:13:51] <%scaryboisupreme> My finger muscle memory did the same thing pat
[4:13:52] <miabyte> do that just hit down at the top of the ramp
[4:13:53] <thatdudenamedlogan> Is whatever the fuck at the top of this worth it?
[4:13:53] <+bugz_munny> It's literally Shinespark into the ramp
[4:13:53] <hydragoon513> That's the way, smash into the ramp and then store it again and shoot up.
[4:13:55] <Syrushmx> just shut up
[4:13:59] <%greasypete00> yes it did
[4:14:00] <+Pachi3000> No, it did, you just cancelled it
[4:14:01] <%whyskeywolfe> Why does he keep leaving the room
[4:14:01] <+NickHatesSnow> BECAUSE YOU DIDN"T
[4:14:02] <+gustavozxd> you started running again
[4:14:02] <+ReallyBigRocks> nah I saw it
[4:14:02] <@GeneralSCPatton> Shine into slope resumes the boosted run
[4:14:03] <tanarath> z
[4:14:03] <+tomdwarf> You started running up the ramp again pat
[4:14:03] <Visorak6> You DASHED DOWN
[4:14:04] <%ShinobiPhoenix> you don't need to do most of what chat is trying to say, all you have to do is run up the first ramp and charge the spark, then JUMP over the second ramp
[4:14:04] <+supersonic21> no it reset your boost but you meleed out of it
[4:14:05] <+bugz_munny> BECAUSE YOU NEVER HIT IT RIGHT
[4:14:06] <%ToadKing> when you dash SIDEWAYS into the ramp
[4:14:06] <%bevyrage> were you holding the button after the dash?
[4:14:07] <Onjani> It did
[4:14:08] <%cvp5127> try it on the first ramp
[4:14:08] <+Emperor_Z> When you dashed into the ramp you were doing the speed boost run again
[4:14:09] <%Niney_Who> No, you were set back to full speed-boosting so you could hit down again to get a new Shinespark
[4:14:12] <+RobocopSanchez> this goes crazy
[4:14:12] <marvel877> CRAZY TALK
[4:14:13] <+bugz_munny> YOU KEEP GOING DIAGONALLY
[4:14:13] <%blastyoboots> @PatStaresAt You almost had it when you shinesparked into the ramp. it actually CONTINUED the shinerun and stopped when you did a slide
[4:14:14] <Onatamana> chat is offering 3 different solutions, and none of them are explaining it in the span of a single message.
[4:14:14] <+zuzuxiv> no when you SPARK into the ramp, you go back into a dash
[4:14:17] <%Mr_Pylon> new goblin, this upgrade
[4:14:18] <%Buzzard42> you have to dash into the ramp horizontally
[4:14:19] <brachydios777> Oh no
[4:14:19] <+Dreshura> It put you back into Speed Boost, you just needed to store your power again
[4:14:19] <Explodincatz> do it sideways
[4:14:20] <%Niney_Who> Yeah
[4:14:21] <%twohitgood> when you spark into the ramp, it puts you back into a run state.
[4:14:21] <+JonathLP> YES
[4:14:22] <redwidow1358> You aren't hitting the ramp the way chat is trying to communicate though
[4:14:22] <+JonathLP> YES PAT
[4:14:23] <Asuterisuku> Too early.
[4:14:24] <SaltyAzteca> THERE IT IS
[4:14:24] <ToneBacas> experiment with the first slope. store at the bottom, jump straight up, spark towards the ramp horizontally. at the top, store again
[4:14:24] <%greasypete00> now yuo c
[4:14:25] <+ClickyButtons> You can just jump up the ramp you just have to have perfect timing
[4:14:25] <+JonathLP> YOU CAN DO IT
[4:14:25] <+gustavozxd> uh
[4:14:27] <+zoopbooploop> got it
[4:14:29] <+ReallyBigRocks> that's spicy
[4:14:29] <$OfficerMods> @Pachi3000 normal people are supposed to ignore this on first playthrough ask around then learn so they want to go back and play the whole game again
[4:14:29] <+bugz_munny> Dear god
[4:14:30] <+JonathLP> HE SEES THE MATRIX
[4:14:30] <%Niney_Who> They weren't playing around with puzzles in this
[4:14:30] <+s1eepyshiba> how do y'all feel about L3 activating speed boost?
[4:14:31] <Roglef> lore downloaded
[4:14:31] <+Pachi3000> Yeah, that's what we were saying by "Dash Into The Ramp"
[4:14:31] <+Grayhammatter> yep, that's the do it
[4:14:31] <%MugenSandan> Pat try dashing horizontally into the first ramp and see what happens
[4:14:32] <%athuramn> there you go
[4:14:34] <%ShinobiPhoenix> litearlly all of this canceling and re-cancelling stuff is super unncessary
[4:14:34] <%zarkazeon> THERE
[4:14:35] <mike2hands> THAT'S IRT
[4:14:36] <%scaryboisupreme> YOU CAN DO IT GINGER MAN
[4:14:36] <+gustavozxd> you could have just...
[4:14:38] <brachydios777> There it is
[4:14:39] <%scaryboisupreme> YEEEEEEEAH
[4:14:40] <KaeporaGaepora> fuck yeah
[4:14:41] <%mostbrokenrobo> YE YE YE
[4:14:41] <%greasypete00> HES DONE IT
[4:14:42] <+DeaconBluesClues> @PatStaresAt I feel like this could have been avoided by using FGC numpad notation
[4:14:42] <SaltyAzteca> THERE YA GO
[4:14:42] <+gustavozxd> ITS SICK
[4:14:42] <+JonathLP> THERE IT IS BOYZ
[4:14:43] <%Agami23> yeah!
[4:14:43] <$OfficerMods> its rad
[4:14:43] <Roglef> ayy nice
[4:14:43] <Louie_Salmon> YEYEYE
[4:14:44] <Tham1k> lol
[4:14:44] <Faithless_Zealot> Clap
[4:14:45] <+tomdwarf> Nice job
[4:14:45] <%Buzzard42> YE
[4:14:46] <+Emperor_Z> You're gonna hate the one in the water zone
[4:14:46] <+rorschachsjournal505> Like you guys are giving him all the tech useful for something he does not need to use and it’s confusing the shit outta him.
[4:14:47] <+supersonic21> hahah you think thats bad
[4:14:47] <%bevyrage> YEAAAAAAAAAAAAAAH
[4:14:47] <+transporterthesequel> garts all
[4:14:47] <wqorst> chat's weird y+b shit made it way worse
[4:14:47] <Spudmeister9000> because yall overcomplicated it
[4:14:48] <%Niney_Who> @PatStaresAt There's one where you gotta chain like 3 later on, have fun
[4:14:48] <Asuterisuku> Now imagine doing that six times for a single Energy Tank.
[4:14:48] <%twohitgood> chat sucked at explaining it.
[4:14:49] <@TheYellowcouch> gg ez no re
[4:14:49] <%criticalink_> noice
[4:14:50] <+zuzuxiv> it's cool tho
[4:14:51] <%silvery_cricket> HE IS LEARNING LOOK AT HIM GO
[4:14:51] <miabyte> ggs
[4:14:51] <+ReallyBigRocks> nah thats really cool
[4:14:52] <TwistParabola> clap clap
[4:14:52] <scarman125> way to go
[4:14:52] <+NickHatesSnow> He's learning
[4:14:53] <+bugz_munny> LOL just because you didnt figure it out dont get pissy
[4:14:53] <%cvp5127> it gets worst
[4:14:54] <%BlueVanRoss> good puzzle
[4:14:54] <Spudmeister9000> this was so simple
[4:14:54] <+zoopbooploop> The irony is that this canceling was optional. You could have space jumped up the ramp by being fast
[4:14:55] <+Evendrag> nah its great, chat is just dumb
[4:14:55] <gygias10> theres even worse one in zero mission
[4:14:55] <%athuramn> nailed it first try
[4:14:56] <%DeepPix3l> HES STARTING TO BELIEVE psaDab
[4:14:56] <SaltyAzteca> THATS SHINESPARK LESSONS 301 @PatStaresAt
[4:14:58] <%Mr_Pylon> Clap
[4:14:58] <%ShinobiPhoenix> that was the VERY hard way to do waht waas really simple, wow chat is terrible
[4:14:59] <%silvery_cricket> NOW YOU ARE A REAL METROID!!!
[4:14:59] <+Pachi3000> I'm sorry, no, they need to explain about the ramps
[4:14:59] <%TheLemuroid> There were lots of shine spark puzzles like that in Super
[4:14:59] <%Agami23> now do you see why shinespark is stupid as fuck and some people hate it?
[4:15:00] <brachydios777> YOU .... DID IT
[4:15:00] <bahble> awesome
[4:15:00] <marvel877> That's how Shinesparking works, Pat.
[4:15:01] <%Monkeyweed21> it only sucks cuz you didnt know the trick
[4:15:01] <+LastHazzerd> good energy tho
[4:15:02] <AzureFlame98> I like to think people tell him the hardest way to do something just to fuck with him cause they know he'll listen for a bit lol
[4:15:02] <+megaman_sentinel> n 2 da ramp lol
[4:15:02] <+Pachi3000> That's dumb
[4:15:03] <Roglef> all that work for a piece of heart
[4:15:03] <hydragoon513> Chat was really bad at explaining it.
[4:15:04] <+Emperor_Z> You didnt really try to get it
[4:15:04] <%greasypete00> this puzzle only sucked because you had chat telling you 2 ways of doing it
[4:15:05] <akitanito> you never did, you just went down
[4:15:05] <%scaryboisupreme> yeah you forgot to get it lmao
[4:15:05] <Onjani> This puzzle is based B)
[4:15:07] <zentzen> your just bad
[4:15:08] <+gustavozxd> @twohitgood it's weird to explain in a few words
[4:15:11] <+zuzuxiv> tbf they should have told you about sparking into ramps, but the game doesn't do that
[4:15:12] <+bugz_munny> That's the easiest of all of them lol
[4:15:13] <%mostbrokenrobo> YOU GOT GUD
[4:15:14] <%Keaton_x> Don't worry, there's only like 6 more bullshit speed-block puzzles.
[4:15:15] <+Pachi3000> It just has hidden abilities the game never tells you
[4:15:17] <%Buzzard42> all that for a drop of blood
[4:15:19] <Saladpoke> fifiDab fifiDab fifiDab
[4:15:21] <%SaiyanShoto> Nah that puzzle is great you just made it harder on yourself
[4:15:23] <$OfficerMods> there are two kinds of people, those who think shine spark puzzles are dumb and those who realize its dumb but feel too cool to care
[4:15:32] <ToneBacas> it's fine just ignore the stuff you can't get. it's probably locked behind a block you can't destroy yet
[4:15:34] <Psykoknight65> @rorschachsjournal505 he'll actually need it for one upgrade that requires you to do 2 of the spark ramp resets
[4:15:36] <%ShinobiPhoenix> all that  was needed was JUMPING over the ramp
[4:15:38] <+gustavozxd> I agree
[4:15:40] <brachydios777> Pat did do it though
[4:15:41] <+Pachi3000> NO IT'S DUMB because the game never tells you. I had to look it up
[4:15:42] <akitanito> I blame chat chaos
[4:15:42] <Onatamana> Chat ALSO made it harder
[4:15:45] <%Niney_Who> Yeah no they should have explain3ed that
[4:15:46] <mike2hands> AGREE
[4:15:49] <Spudmeister9000> YOU DONT NEED TO DO THAT THERE
[4:15:50] <%mostbrokenrobo> Except decades of Metroid history...
[4:15:50] <+Grayhammatter> true
[4:15:50] <ToneBacas> unexplained mechanics
[4:15:51] <%DeepPix3l> TBF the game does not explain that mechanic
[4:15:52] <%Niney_Who> The game failed to explain it
[4:15:53] <Tham1k> They don't tell you that
[4:15:53] <Louie_Salmon> Unless you played other metroid games
[4:15:53] <TheHotStuven> thats basic speed booster stuff in other metroids
[4:15:54] <+transporterthesequel> To be fair, yes, that is weird
[4:15:55] <SaltyAzteca> Chat he has never played Metroid he is learning how shinespark works
[4:15:55] <%AncelDeLambert> they want you to experiment, and that's how it worked in all those games you never played
[4:15:55] <+supersonic21> aparently its an old mechanic from other games
[4:15:55] <+bugz_munny> It's almost like this game doesnt tell you shit about the shinespark at all
[4:15:56] <scarman125> AGREE
[4:15:56] <+Evendrag> chat sucks tbh
[4:15:56] <%TheLemuroid> The ramp thing is a mechanic from previous games
[4:15:56] <$OfficerMods> its been tech since fusion
[4:15:56] <+gustavozxd> that is ALSO true
[4:15:57] <%Buzzard42> dashing into a ramp has caused it to reset since at least Fusion
[4:15:57] <+McDerpus> it's not so bad once you know the trick, but the trick is not obvious at all
[4:15:58] <Psykoknight65> @patstaresat there is if you played more than super
[4:15:58] <Kaji04> Oh yeah that tech is bullshit but it will come back
[4:15:58] <%zarkazeon> that puzzle is dumb and chat made it harder for you.
[4:16:01] <akitanito> space  jump
[4:16:01] <%blastyoboots> @PatStaresAt You could have just space jumped over the ramp before the storage ended
[4:16:01] <%scaryboisupreme> Actually it's not dumb if you've played a metroid game before
[4:16:02] <miabyte> @patstaresat apologies for not explaining it thoroughly. With so much cross information from chat that must have been frustrating
[4:16:03] <+NickHatesSnow> The puzzle is good, the fact they never explain it sucks
[4:16:04] <+tomdwarf> Thats fair. I only know that because of previous games. Nothing in game tells you that.
[4:16:05] <brachydios777> They don't tell to be fair
[4:16:06] <+Emperor_Z> Due to the angle, you don't collide directly into it, which allows Samus to run on it instead. It makes physical sense
[4:16:06] <%SaiyanShoto> It's been a thing in Metroid for a long time though
[4:16:07] <Asuterisuku> You have infinite jumps.
[4:16:08] <%Buzzard42> but it sucks major ass to learn
[4:16:08] <+JonathLP> wall jump from the right wall
[4:16:09] <%Piemono> Game doesn't mention a lot of stuff when it comes to speed dashing
[4:16:10] <+RobocopSanchez> dont work yourself into a shoot pat
[4:16:11] <Explodincatz> thats most of Metroid tricks tho lol
[4:16:13] <%greasypete00> its weird that they didnt explain but i think it makes sense
[4:16:13] <+megaman_sentinel> then u never played fusion lol
[4:16:13] <juhbathehutt> the only way you'd know that is if you played the other games. it needed to be in the tutorial
[4:16:14] <@GeneralSCPatton> That mechanic has always existed
[4:16:15] <zentzen> its a normal metroid mechanic
[4:16:17] <+Pachi3000> @mostbrokenrobo Yeah because you never have new people playing games, right
[4:16:18] <+Orcapugs> Golbin
[4:16:20] <%scaryboisupreme> there's plenty of puzzles like that in Zero Mission and Fusion
[4:16:20] <redwidow1358> The reason to believe that is because every other game that isn't Super or Samus Returns has that mechanic.
[4:16:22] <Notterr> you can't get this yet
[4:16:23] <kekleon020> hi pat
[4:16:24] <+Orcapugs> Goblin
[4:16:25] <+bugz_munny> Probably need time stop
[4:16:27] <Onjani> TRUE, but shine chaining is epic B)
[4:16:29] <$OfficerMods> you aren't supposed to know that it can reset it, it's literally tech to make you look up stuff online or with frens
[4:16:30] <+gustavozxd> @generalscpatton even in super?
[4:16:34] <TheHotStuven> @Notterr LUL
[4:16:36] <%Agami23> its a thing from old metroid games so old metroid fans know it and new ones dont. so bullshit
[4:16:36] <+tomdwarf> Nice
[4:16:38] <+JonathLP> He's doing it
[4:16:43] <+zoopbooploop> The reset is necessary for other puzzles, that one could be done with just the space jump
[4:16:43] <ToneBacas> you win 2 missiles
[4:16:44] <Blank9> it's an optional legacy mechanic like roll jumping in dkc, but never explained
[4:16:49] <+Grayhammatter> you... did it
[4:16:50] <+Rolandknight> damn wave beam would have made that easy lol
[4:16:51] <Psykoknight65> there's reason to believe it resets because the other 2d games you didn't play had that same mechanic
[4:16:53] <+rorschachsjournal505> No pat, chat was giving way too much advice. The puzzle is fine.
[4:16:53] <+DeaconBluesClues> @OfficerMods what is this dark souls questline bullshit
[4:16:57] <%ShinobiPhoenix> chat being terrible talking about cancelling and resetting was just ridicious.  I can under if it was the OTHER one wehre you LITERALLY have to do all that, but that was one just a matter of jumping over a ramp
[4:16:58] <+LastHazzerd> this sure is a helluva puzzle game
[4:16:58] <+gustavozxd> @redwidow1358 so just fusion? LUL
[4:17:01] <butthurtdave> Hey Pat, just beat Heavensward and wanted to pop in and say IT WAS RAD
[4:17:01] <+bugz_munny> This game's shinespark tutorial is complete anus
[4:17:03] <brachydios777> First Full 2D Metroid guys, remember that
[4:17:04] <+Pachi3000> @OfficerMods How the fuck is that the intent
[4:17:05] <Saltmeisterr> where to now pat? :)
[4:17:05] <%TheLemuroid> yeah the shine spark ramping trick was like SNES era guide book stuff
[4:17:06] <%OrangeMDT> Yay! 2!
[4:17:07] <hydragoon513> Shinespark tech is something that should be better explained.
[4:17:14] <%NigelSchnauzerpug> What time does Pat plan on streaming til?
[4:17:19] <Asuterisuku> The way forward is among the trees.
[4:17:25] <%silvery_cricket> Pat its a obvious puzzle if you played older metroid games, its old tech that the game doesnt explain
[4:17:26] <$OfficerMods> @pachi3000 so you go back and run the game again cuz metroid games are kinda short
[4:17:26] <+tomdwarf> Yeah, to assume everyone knows advanced shinespark stuff without tutorial, because previous games had it, is a bit asanine.
[4:17:32] <Syrushmx> until its done
[4:17:35] <akitanito> chat wants to make pat look cool, but only made the goblins worse
[4:17:44] <%scaryboisupreme> I suggest you go further cause the next upgrade looks so fucking cool
[4:17:46] <+McDerpus> to be fair, it's only used for secrets
[4:17:50] <%Niney_Who> Dairon is the big zone
[4:17:52] <%blastyoboots> i mean it's in the middle
[4:17:52] <TheHotStuven> Everything leads to Dairon
[4:17:53] <Saltmeisterr> you have  like another stream left
[4:17:53] <%zarkazeon> I got lost as to where to go now. your next big objective is in water world.
[4:17:54] <%dekkitout> Dairon is hawt fire
[4:17:55] <SaltyAzteca> Dairon deez nuts Kappa
[4:17:55] <+Grayhammatter> return, to dairon
[4:17:55] <Blank9> he didn't play older games, so you can't really know
[4:17:55] <+BioStormX> @tomdwarf I played the previous games and never got the hang of it myself
[4:17:55] <%silvery_cricket> Dairon is a happening place
[4:17:56] <%Monkeyweed21> Dai ron these nuts
[4:17:59] <Onatamana> Explore and upgrade, until it is done.
[4:17:59] <Tham1k> Daiton is where it's at
[4:18:06] <+Pachi3000> @OfficerMods No I'll play the game again because it's fun. That's not a reason to intentionally not tell the player tech you have available to you
[4:18:06] <$Falilth> ah yes shinespark stephen kings best novel
[4:18:10] <Onjani> I only knew about the slope resets because of speedruns
[4:18:10] <+zoopbooploop> Oh man this next section is so good
[4:18:13] <%GarbageNirvana> Dairon is Japanese for "Big Ron"
[4:18:15] <+NickHatesSnow> Die Ron
[4:18:16] <+Emperor_Z> You've played N, right? If you fall into a slope, you don't splat. Instead, you can run on it. Same principle as spinesharking into a slope
[4:18:19] <+gustavozxd> @tomdwarf I don't think that ever actually HAD a tutorial, it's just some secret tech used for puzzles and sequence skips
[4:18:35] <+Grayhammatter> hm... now where to
[4:18:35] <%The_0_2_Hero> Y'know what would solve this issue? Animals showing you the technique
[4:18:39] <%scaryboisupreme> Brunaria
[4:18:41] <+fragilewatches> The Ron, The
[4:18:41] <%ShinobiPhoenix> people keep saying it's easy if you played other games, but really they just watched other people do it first and then act like experts, then end up over complicating simple things
[4:18:41] <%TheLemuroid> Now imagine sequences with multiple ramp resets
[4:18:42] <%extradopeness> @garbagenirvana lmao
[4:18:43] <%SaiyanShoto> Shinespark tech is really only used for secrets so it's fine
[4:18:48] <%scaryboisupreme> You gotta go to water world
[4:18:49] <Saltmeisterr> what item did you just get pat?
[4:18:56] <KingJackel> I think this is the point where you go to Burenia (left side)
[4:18:57] <$OfficerMods> @Blank9 its not like they explained it in fusion either. If this seems like dark souls bullshit to you then welcome to where dark souls got most of it bird dna
[4:18:57] <Asuterisuku> The easy way to get where you want to go is in Ghavoran.
[4:18:59] <%The_0_2_Hero> Not an explicit tutorial but in the style of Super
[4:19:03] <+DeaconBluesClues> @ShinobiPhoenix no, I think it would be fine if chat knew numpad notation
[4:19:07] <%thedankestmeeme> Dave Chapelle voice "who is the 5 best rappers you know? 1.Dylan 2.Dylan 3.Dylan Dylan and Dylan Cause I spit hot fire
[4:19:08] <Visorak6> unda da sea, pat
[4:19:10] <%BlueVanRoss> for items
[4:19:10] <Kaji04> Yes
[4:19:12] <+bugz_munny> They honestly should have made you go through a typical shinespark puzzle to proceed
[4:19:13] <+Grayhammatter> haha...
[4:19:13] <+tomdwarf> @gustavozxd Fair yeah, I only knew about it from playing Zero mission, and some friends showing me you could do it. None of the in-game stuff, not even 100%, requires it.
[4:19:15] <+zuzuxiv> a bit
[4:19:16] <Onatamana> much
[4:19:16] <+NickHatesSnow> It's Metroid Pat so a lot
[4:19:19] <SaltyAzteca> Yes.
[4:19:21] <marvel877> 50% apparently
[4:19:23] <%AncelDeLambert> bunch of stuff
[4:19:23] <+bugz_munny> but they dont make you use any of its tech at all
[4:19:24] <redwidow1358> This game does a really good job of hiding shit
[4:19:29] <%zettig> The maps are also lies
[4:19:29] <marvel877> I mean, it says it right there, Pat.
[4:19:32] <%AncelDeLambert> see that red part? Way more of that.
[4:19:34] <+Pachi3000> I just don't like the idea of a collectible being hidden behind secret tech, lol
[4:19:34] <+zuzuxiv> not much, it's just items
[4:19:34] <%zarkazeon> water world next
[4:19:38] <blue8moon> around 50%?
[4:19:39] <buerdo> 50% of all
[4:19:39] <+McDerpus> there are a few hidden rooms in maps
[4:19:40] <%BlueVanRoss> 50% of items
[4:19:40] <trigunstar26> What is pat in the story
[4:19:45] <trigunstar26> Where
[4:19:46] <+Grayhammatter> burenia time i guess
[4:19:48] <%Monkeyweed21> @PatStaresAt theres a storm missile gate in Daiton
[4:19:50] <+gustavozxd> @pachi3000 that's fair
[4:19:50] <Asuterisuku> @tomdwarf There are Etanks and power bombs that require it.
[4:20:00] <+zuzuxiv> gavlaan wheel, gavlaan deal
[4:20:03] <$OfficerMods> @trigunstar26 just released the x parasite
[4:20:07] <%ShinobiPhoenix> @bugz_munny it's almost like it's not necessary to play or enjoy the game or something
[4:20:07] <$OfficerMods> whoops
[4:20:15] <+gustavozxd> I guess they just assumed everyone who would play this knew about it? Big oversight
[4:20:16] <Onjani> get wet and wild
[4:20:22] <+Pachi3000> They mean Dairon
[4:20:22] <+Grayhammatter> dairon
[4:20:26] <%Monkeyweed21> Dairon
[4:20:27] <%dekkitout> Is Daiton the 6th best?
[4:20:28] <+bugz_munny> What if you enjoy getting 100%?
[4:20:28] <Asuterisuku> It was a typo.
[4:20:30] <+zuzuxiv> I think they misspelled
[4:20:31] <+bugz_munny> Without a guide
[4:20:31] <marvel877> they mean dairon
[4:20:32] <fcKurl> is it secret tech? the game tells you how to exectute a shine spark the rest is experimenting just like any other secret
[4:20:39] <+emperri> top 5 rappers of all time
[4:20:39] <KingJackel> It's just for an item
[4:20:39] <+bugz_munny> Like I do
[4:20:50] <Louie_Salmon> Has anyone told Pat about the Y button tech?
[4:20:50] <+Emperor_Z> Some of the loading screen tips explain the shine spark tech. Problem is that those ones only show up when you're loading your game
[4:20:53] <%blastyoboots> @PatStaresAt the zones are named with A, B, C, D, E, F names
[4:20:58] <$OfficerMods> @gustavozxd no its there to be a secret something you have to ask around to figure and then go back to the game and try it yourself. Just like all the sequence breaks
[4:21:05] <Louie_Salmon> On the map I mean, to highlight things
[4:21:17] <+gustavozxd> @fckurl it's a hidden mechanic that is not something most people are gonna just assume is like that
[4:21:34] <Asuterisuku> Not yet.
[4:21:34] <%greasypete00> @blastyoboots  i never realized that
[4:21:35] <+tomdwarf> @fcKurl There is nothing in game that would suggest hitting a ramp could "reset" a shine run. Granted, I love that shit. But putting items behind knowing that is a bit sucky.
[4:21:36] <SaltyAzteca> Oh its this one
[4:21:40] <+bugz_munny> There isnt an excuse for not telling your player your moveset unless it's dirt simple
[4:21:42] <%ShinobiPhoenix> @bugz_munny sure, Jirard the Completionist certainly doesn't deal with depression and anxiety or anything from the damage such things does to his mental health or anything for somethign that amounts to a NFT
[4:21:42] <+Emperor_Z> That one is not tech. That one you just cant do yet
[4:21:42] <Saltmeisterr> still can't do it
[4:21:43] <+Grayhammatter> not yet
[4:21:43] <%greasypete00> you still cant
[4:21:46] <+bugz_munny> Shinespark isnt
[4:21:47] <+Pachi3000> @OfficerMods Sequence breaks are one thing, they're super not required. Locking collectibles behind secret tech is shit.
[4:21:50] <redwidow1358> This is a super fun shinespark puzzle
[4:21:54] <%scaryboisupreme> you'll know how to get it when you get the upgrade
[4:21:54] <+zuzuxiv> definitely a not yey
[4:21:59] <+bugz_munny> @ShinobiPhoenix dude are you high?
[4:22:02] <%greasypete00> you maybe could with some tricky ballsparking but its probably harder than its worth
[4:22:12] <Louie_Salmon> @pachi3000 Well those aren't required either though
[4:22:13] <+bugz_munny> What the heck does that even have to do with what I said
[4:22:15] <%blastyoboots> @PatStaresAt the zones are named with A, B, C, D, E, F names
[4:22:19] <redwidow1358> All you need for that upgrade is missiles, bombs, and the speed booster. It isn't super tough.
[4:22:20] <%TarikBot> CONCERNING
[4:22:22] <%greasypete00> hmmmmmmmm
[4:22:22] <+emperri> tuuuuuuuuubes
[4:22:22] <Onatamana> didn't even give that bat the dignity of shooting it. just lap it out of your way
[4:22:23] <+the22cstomp> LUL
[4:22:23] <%scaryboisupreme> hey uh
[4:22:24] <fcKurl> ohhh resetting it yeah i got you. the ramp part makes sense though, like at some point trying to crack a secret you can see what happens when you hit a ramp
[4:22:24] <$OfficerMods> Zero mission made it really obvious what the sequence breaks where it was just really hard to do. Fusion didn't really have breaks but alot of shine spark puzzles that make you ask around and go "But how actually do you do it"
[4:22:26] <+Emperor_Z> That thing broke out!? What?
[4:22:26] <+zuzuxiv> OH NO
[4:22:27] <+Grayhammatter> well that fuckers gone
[4:22:32] <+Pachi3000> @Louie_Salmon I mean that's fair too, it's just frustrating
[4:22:33] <Saltmeisterr> HMMM
[4:22:35] <%scaryboisupreme> that's mildy ominous
[4:22:39] <%silvery_cricket> subtle
[4:22:40] <+bugz_munny> Like Im talking about bad tutorials and you bring up NFTs and shit lol
[4:22:40] <ChaoticDaKiller> hey did you know that the X can inhabit a dead host???
[4:22:49] <+DeaconBluesClues> uh chat what waas there before
[4:22:54] <%TheLemuroid> HEY the big creature is gone
[4:22:59] <Asuterisuku> That missile's real easy though.
[4:23:00] <TheHotStuven> A big monster dude
[4:23:05] <@goose_attack_almanac> @DeaconBluesClues a big dead creature being poked and prodded and zapped
[4:23:05] <%silvery_cricket> @DeaconBluesClues big ant
[4:23:10] <ChaoticDaKiller> @DeaconBluesClues a fucking problem, that's what was there
[4:23:40] <%ShinobiPhoenix> @bugz_munny there's a reason new important mechanics in Magic the Gathering are explained using COMMON cards and more advanced things are only mildly suggested in rares... since you're talking about a game design related concept
[4:23:44] <%scaryboisupreme> wait you So the missiles shoot in order
[4:23:52] <%scaryboisupreme> nice
[4:23:57] <+gustavozxd> shine spark NFT 🤔
[4:23:58] <gygias10> haha
[4:23:58] <@Moobot> Hey folks, just a reminder! If you have Twitch connected to Discord, you can access the PSA Sub-Discord. Go to your User Settings, go to Connections, and click 'Join' on the PSA server under the Twitch connection.
[4:23:59] <+bugz_munny> ....dude what
[4:24:10] <+Grayhammatter> ah ha!
[4:24:11] <fcKurl> nice
[4:24:12] <+bugz_munny> my point was shinespark has a horrible tutorial in this game
[4:24:14] <%scaryboisupreme> Damn that dude got got
[4:24:23] <+bugz_munny> Like you are lost in the sauce brother
[4:24:29] <+gustavozxd> @bugz_munny don't ask questions just buy the shinespark NFT
[4:24:31] <$OfficerMods> @bugz_munny better than super's tutorial
[4:24:33] <Asuterisuku> Another Not Yet.
[4:24:41] <%scaryboisupreme> I'm glad there's no X transformation puzzles in this
[4:24:57] <$OfficerMods> Super didn't even tell you about crystal flash
[4:25:01] <+Grayhammatter> big not yet
[4:25:02] <SaltyAzteca> It might be possible
[4:25:03] <+gustavozxd> @officermods no tutorial at all is better than super's?
[4:25:09] <%X2Eliah> U destroyed your foothold
[4:25:14] <SaltyAzteca> Freeze the enemy and use it as a platform
[4:25:15] <Saltmeisterr> wtf is crystal flash?
[4:25:17] <%X2Eliah> shoulda froze instead of boomed
[4:25:24] <+gustavozxd> I guess it does tell you you can do it, that counts
[4:25:27] <$OfficerMods> @gustavozxd they tell you how to shine spark as soon as you get the item in this game
[4:25:32] <redwidow1358> This is one you can do if you spam the flash shift through the breakable blocks, but it's a pain to nail the timing. Just come back later
[4:25:35] <+Emperor_Z> @gustavozxd The game explicitly tells you about the basics of shinepsarking, so yes
[4:25:36] <%scaryboisupreme> I think you gotta find a teleporter for this next burenia part
[4:25:38] <Asuterisuku> If you were playing Super metroid and finding everything you would never ever need to Crystal Flash.
[4:25:45] <%zarkazeon> so close to o e of the best upgrades pat just a little farther!
[4:25:46] <+gustavozxd> it's basically super's tutorial but with words instead
[4:25:49] <Asuterisuku> The teleporter is in Ghavoran.
[4:25:55] <TIME_PUNCHER> dang ol parasite Xussy
[4:25:57] <%TheLemuroid> 1st try
[4:26:01] <ChaoticDaKiller> holy fuckin shit first try
[4:26:02] <%JoshManVGH> @officermods The hecks a "Crystal Flash"‽
[4:26:14] <Nocturnment> xussy
[4:26:21] <%ShinobiPhoenix> @bugz_munny if you're going to talk aobut a game design element, you should know what you're actually talking about. the fact you didn't understand the analogy means you really don't.  The Shinespark tutorial isn't supposed to teach you the advanced stuff because it's not necessary and only bogs down a player with unncessary information tehy don't need but think they do because they think anything they are being told must be relevant at the time. This is LITERALLY why Pat had trouble with playin
[4:26:29] <Asuterisuku> @JoshManVGH It's a desperation move in Super metroid that trades a bunch of your resources for Health.
[4:26:32] <%scaryboisupreme> the teleporter requirement is kinda bullshit in this
[4:26:34] <Visorak6> DOOR STUCK
[4:26:36] <marvel877> @JoshManVGH secret healing move in Super Metroid that honestly is not worth it.
[4:26:40] <$OfficerMods> I'm shocked so many people don't know about crystal flash, super metroid has a mechanic where you can trade power bombs for samus to do a room clearing super move
[4:26:46] <olaksi> can you two get a room already
[4:26:55] <%Andrizzleton> lol at people mad that they might have to figure stuff out
[4:26:56] <+tomdwarf> Pat dont look. Were arguing about shinespark advanced tech!
[4:26:58] <ComeEase> New copypasta
[4:27:02] <+gustavozxd> @shinobiphoenix where does the NFT and depression get into play
[4:27:04] <+Emperor_Z> @bugz_munny It's like 4 sentences dude
[4:27:04] <+MaliciousHero> Cant we all just get along?
[4:27:06] <%JoshManVGH> That sounds kinda neat.
[4:27:07] <wqorst> lol
[4:27:07] <%SuckerPunchSyd> Don’t start up again
[4:27:08] <brachydios777> Chill chat
[4:27:08] <%X2Eliah> just ban them lol
[4:27:10] <%The_0_2_Hero> donald_glover_pizza.gif
[4:27:11] <Tham1k> Again? lol
[4:27:13] <+emperri> is only game, why you heff to be mad
[4:27:14] <+zuzuxiv> LOL WHO?
[4:27:20] <%The_0_2_Hero> OH I DIDN'T KNOW THAT LINKS
[4:27:21] <%scaryboisupreme> Pat recognizes a target on site
[4:27:21] <%greasypete00> who?
[4:27:22] <%scaryboisupreme> sight
[4:27:24] <Syrushmx> chill out guys
[4:27:24] <%scaryboisupreme> fuck
[4:27:24] <Gelphaze> Whats going on
[4:27:31] <TrollKing96> I feel like Troy in the darkest timeline.
[4:27:34] <%WeLucklessJacks> How is there a storm underground.
[4:27:34] <+tomdwarf> We can all have our argument on youtube later guys.
[4:27:37] <%Buzzard42> lol
[4:27:44] <%cooldude69xx> @gustavozxd When NFT's aren't onscreen, everyone should be asking: "Where are the NFTs?"
[4:27:47] <%GarbageNirvana> Nobody likes the guy who shits in the punch bowl
[4:27:49] <%silvery_cricket> @WeLucklessJacks condesation
[4:27:52] <Asuterisuku> I assure you.
[4:27:56] <miabyte> mom come pick me up I'm scared of chat heyshaPlead
[4:27:58] <Asuterisuku> The path to where you want to go is in Ghavoran.
[4:27:59] <%greasypete00> @welucklessjacks don't worry about it
[4:28:03] <%X2Eliah> Guys, stop arguing here as post all your critique to at wooliewoolz on twitter.
[4:28:06] <moonmeh> is metroid an elaborate nft scam
[4:28:15] <KingJackel> If you did not know, you can grapple those laser enemies.
[4:28:17] <%silvery_cricket> @WeLucklessJacks Condensation
[4:28:21] <$OfficerMods> WELCOME TO THE SHINE SPARK SPATOON HOW FAST ARE YA
[4:28:22] <%JGardner03> When can I buy my psa brand NFT's
[4:28:31] <TIME_PUNCHER> @garbagenirvana i dunno about *nobody*...
[4:28:34] <fcKurl> nft metroid in raid shadow legends
[4:28:44] <%Buzzard42> this bickering makes me so upset, I'm going to go unfollow wooliewoolz
[4:28:47] <%marusux> This is the only area that has pretty decent music
[4:28:47] <Syrushmx> its ok but stop dragging the comments, about stuff people where unable to find or do in games from 2 decades ago
[4:28:49] <%LeiaSkynoober> When can I get my Pat NFR tho
[4:28:49] <olaksi> bruh
[4:28:51] <%silvery_cricket> You gotta stop joking about NFTs or you are gonna summon actual crypto bros
[4:28:51] <%scaryboisupreme> Welllllllllll
[4:28:52] <Louie_Salmon> Please redirect all Metroid Dread lore and gameplay arguments to r/mpreg
[4:28:52] <brachydios777> Da fuck is chat talking about?
[4:28:55] <%GarbageNirvana> @TIME_PUNCHER Literal shit eaters don't count here
[4:28:55] <Vyskus> man chat sucks tonight
[4:28:58] <%X2Eliah> @bugz_munny Dude NOBODY CARES give it a rest already
[4:29:01] <TIME_PUNCHER> drink the poo punch
[4:29:03] <Tham1k> It's almost like this chat is not a place to discuss stuff hmm
[4:29:03] <@GeneralSCPatton> @bugz_munny You just can't stop taking jabs at everyone, can you?
[4:29:06] <%Bane_Kaikyo> @bugz_munny Because you are screaming about it and not having civil discourse
[4:29:06] <+gustavozxd> Metroid 6 will be a simulator where you play as Samus trying to sell her NFTs
[4:29:08] <%extradopeness> send all complaints to Woolie's Twitter
[4:29:17] <Onjani> Just drink all the water dude
[4:29:18] <@TheYellowcouch> I leave to do some crafting for 5 minutes huh
[4:29:22] <%BinaryFireball> if youre going to talk about talking about game design then you  really should know that no one knows what they are talking about the fact is facts are subjective in an an unknown and confusing world your words are words but are also setances sometimes they run on and sometime they run on into chat where people like to write big paragraphs about things and have interesting dissucsions about other things sometime my dog looks at me funny which is funny because i dont have a dog
[4:29:22] <+gustavozxd> @tham1k it was one guy tbh
[4:29:23] <%Monkeyweed21> it feels like this game is edging you with certain upgrades, like the morph ball or gravity suit
[4:29:24] <%ShinobiPhoenix> @gustavozxd NFT in something which its value is nebulous and arbitrary but people chase it anyway, depression from constantly needing to chase 100 in things even though it damages your mental health.  you don't actually need to know or do everything to enjoy it
[4:29:24] <+Emperor_Z> Missile tanks are so disappointing
[4:29:25] <Blank9> but what if it has a cool shinespark puzzle too
[4:29:27] <Nocturnment> bugz? more like bussy
[4:29:27] <KingJackel> Don't worry Pat, this is the way forward
[4:29:31] <%scaryboisupreme> Please redirect all metroid dread discourse to @ woolievs
[4:29:32] <Asuterisuku> LUL
[4:29:32] <$OfficerMods> Chat is literally a room of like a hundred guys talking about metroid at the same time, you expect sensible discussion?
[4:29:34] <akitanito> you did this to yourself
[4:29:34] <%Buzzard42> +10
[4:29:37] <Vyskus> hey ten missles is pog tho
[4:29:38] <%silvery_cricket> Please do not mock NFTs, you will summon crypto bros to defend them and try and pawn off their NFTs.
[4:29:38] <Blu_C> Task failed successfully.
[4:29:40] <blue8moon> missiles yeeeeeeeeeee
[4:29:41] <%extradopeness> lmao pat
[4:29:43] <%SuckerPunchSyd> Hey more missles thou
[4:29:45] <%JGardner03> That was almost a big bad
[4:29:46] <marvel877> Its 10 missiles Pat
[4:29:46] <%marusux> Nice!
[4:29:52] <redwidow1358> This is in fact the way to progress, don't worry
[4:29:53] <+Dappercat> i liked the video game
[4:29:54] <+Emperor_Z> 2 missiles is lame, but 10 missiles is pretty okay
[4:29:58] <%mostbrokenrobo> gotta get to 100% 1 missile tank at a time
[4:29:59] <%afronooch> Chat is only unified in love of QUSSY
[4:30:04] <Blank9> but is it going to be 5 missile tanks strapped together
[4:30:05] <+Grayhammatter> nice rhythm
[4:30:07] <%scaryboisupreme> this is in fact progression
[4:30:08] <%LeiaSkynoober> @silvery_cricket No that's good though, that gives free mocking content
[4:30:14] <+Take_2_shots> you got like 5 missile tanks in one
[4:30:15] <Tham1k> We need more missiles
[4:30:16] <SaltyAzteca> so get another LUL
[4:30:17] <+gustavozxd> bugs got shot wtf atpFeelsBeardMan
[4:30:22] <%SuckerPunchSyd> Are there any more upgrades for missle tanks or is it just 2 and 10
[4:30:23] <akitanito> more missiles for storm missiles
[4:30:25] <Onatamana> you got a missile+ tank. That's like 5 missile tanks
[4:30:29] <Asuterisuku> Mind Goblins Activate.
[4:30:32] <+gustavozxd> framed atpFeelsBeardMan
[4:30:33] <%Piemono> But Pat you love being right
[4:30:34] <%JGardner03> It's a missed tank
[4:30:37] <%JoshManVGH> @moonmeh That's the bitter truth about Samus losing her powers every game. She buys them with NFT investments, and when they fail, all her shit gets repossessed. These planets are just debt mines.
[4:30:39] <%SuckerPunchSyd> Oh lord I’ve been spelling missiles wrong
[4:30:45] <Vyskus> I got those missles the hard way LUL
[4:30:48] <Syrushmx> without backsit, is Pat super lost right now?
[4:30:50] <Louie_Salmon> @afronooch But does chat have Cussy
[4:30:55] <%TheWinged7> but pat you love missile tanks
[4:30:59] <%extradopeness> youre so close
[4:31:02] <Saltmeisterr> SQUID
[4:31:02] <%afronooch> @JoshManVGH LUL
[4:31:04] <%OrangeMDT> Yay! 2 again!
[4:31:06] <Nocturnment> can't wait for the water puzzle
[4:31:08] <%scaryboisupreme> The scary ocean zone
[4:31:20] <Qsmash_> this is probably my favorite area in the game
[4:31:21] <$OfficerMods> this might be the best water level in a metroid game
[4:31:22] <%afronooch> @Louie_Salmon some of us
[4:31:26] <%Buzzard42> Pat would you say that this game slaps?
[4:31:29] <%Monkeyweed21> @PatStaresAt remember the storm missiles work on electrified enemies and storm blocks
[4:31:30] <+Grayhammatter> deep ass new
[4:31:32] <%scaryboisupreme> I love the music here
[4:31:32] <blue8moon> water wooooooorld
[4:31:36] <$OfficerMods> as much as i love super maridia is inexcusably bad
[4:31:43] <moonmeh> @JoshManVGH can't believe X are just dogecoins
[4:31:44] <%X2Eliah> wadur
[4:31:51] <%X2Eliah> wadur weed dune hair
[4:31:53] <marvel877> No budget too steep, no sea too deep.
[4:31:54] <%Buzzard42> Maridia is the reason Super isn't perfect
[4:31:57] <%Buzzard42> rekt
[4:32:03] <%ShinobiPhoenix> and to answer the question it's LITERALLY my job as a Game Designer to study how people interact with what we make to know if we should continue with the method we're using, it was simple explanation that explaining Shinespark isn't necessary to enjoy the game
[4:32:04] <moonmeh> the more you type missiles the weirder it looks
[4:32:06] <%marusux> I love this game it’s definitely my game of the year, but the only issue is the music. Not this track tho, I love it haha.
[4:32:21] <%scaryboisupreme> Are ya'll still going on about this
[4:32:28] <akitanito> p-p-progress
[4:32:31] <%scaryboisupreme> Can't we just watch the funny ginger man swim
[4:32:32] <Asuterisuku> No Adam for you!
[4:32:35] <olaksi> @ShinobiPhoenix cool story bro
[4:32:44] <Nocturnment> hot take: water levels are sick
[4:32:44] <%Monkeyweed21> @PatStaresAt storm missiles work electrified enemies and storm blocks btw
[4:32:48] <kinkade_77> glad this game has no super missiles
[4:32:48] <+gustavozxd> @shinobiphoenix the guy who asked already got banned
[4:32:52] <fcKurl> nailed it
[4:32:53] <%SaiyanShoto> LUL LUL
[4:32:57] <TIME_PUNCHER> "I'm just a girl that's a Bounty Hunter for fun."
[4:32:59] <%Monkeyweed21> work on
[4:33:00] <%SuckerPunchSyd> @scaryboisupreme but i thought pasta rats cant swim Kappa
[4:33:00] <+Grayhammatter> well... that was something
[4:33:03] <%ShinobiPhoenix> than we're cool
[4:33:10] <%silvery_cricket> What if we made a NFT of a Bitcoin, that we auctioned off for NFTs that have been purchased with bitcoin.
[4:33:19] <%athuramn> that explains that silence lol
[4:33:22] <jfp4life> i love how pat face tanks his way through normal enemies lol
[4:33:24] <Asuterisuku> Flash Shift didn't stop being a thing.
[4:33:28] <+gustavozxd> atpCap ....
[4:33:32] <%JoshManVGH> Power!
[4:33:38] <%marusux> Nice
[4:33:40] <Onatamana> @marusux I think the game's color palette could have had more diversity too, but I agree
[4:33:44] <trigunstar26> What did pat think of samus doing birdspeak?
[4:33:50] <Asuterisuku> That's a big squid!
[4:33:51] <lloyddboy> WHUSSY
[4:33:53] <Onatamana> Squid
[4:33:55] <fcKurl> i always completely forgot about flash shift until bossfights lol
[4:33:56] <mike2hands> HUZZAA
[4:33:57] <%extradopeness> fight 🐳
[4:33:58] <+Paronoma> i don't want to stir the pot, but the game does explain shinesparking in the description of the Speed Booster item and in loading screen tips
[4:33:58] <+Emperor_Z> @Monkeyweed21 A storm block? You mean the big green blocks, not the ones with the lightning symbol on them, right?
[4:34:00] <moonmeh> what if we base NFTs off twitter posts
[4:34:00] <Nocturnment> nooo, he's not a threat
[4:34:01] <%Piemono> Squssy
[4:34:03] <+Grayhammatter> DEEP OCEAN
[4:34:04] <Onatamana> squissy
[4:34:05] <%RealThiele> cold whussy
[4:34:05] <Saltmeisterr> SQUSSY
[4:34:06] <SaltyAzteca> UNDER DA SEA
[4:34:07] <%JoshManVGH> Squssy?
[4:34:08] <fcKurl> i think you cant do it underwater anyway tho
[4:34:09] <%ShinobiPhoenix> I think everyone loved Samus speaking in Chozo for once
[4:34:09] <wqorst> subnautica zone
[4:34:11] <%scaryboisupreme> Man the X really killed 2 planets huh
[4:34:11] <Blank9> parry slaps one-shot frozen enemies
[4:34:14] <moonmeh> man this water lefvel is cool
[4:34:15] <TIME_PUNCHER> parasite xussy became a whussy
[4:34:18] <%marusux> @onatamana mmmmmm yeah, kinda.
[4:34:22] <$OfficerMods> This game have a wider color pallet? Are you sure? Is there some secret rainbow you aren't telling me about?
[4:34:22] <%criticalink_> god I love the X parasites
[4:34:25] <%SaiyanShoto> Pat sees sea life and instantly shoots it
[4:34:27] <%scaryboisupreme> SR388 was doing fine with the metroids until samus blew them up
[4:34:31] <%Monkeyweed21> @Emperor_Z the tooltip specifically mentioned those things as being vulnerable to storm blocks
[4:34:34] <kinkade_77> please give samus a beam sword next game
[4:34:45] <%scaryboisupreme> @SaiyanShoto like you should
[4:34:50] <+gustavozxd> atpRtsuspectd
[4:34:53] <olaksi> LUL triple blind
[4:34:55] <wqorst> UNKNOWN RESOURCE
[4:34:55] <brachydios777> X are Flood levels of danger
[4:35:04] <%Monkeyweed21> @Emperor_Z storm missiles sorry
[4:35:05] <TIME_PUNCHER> "Sea life? More like I see life I shoot it!"
[4:35:06] <Asuterisuku> Why would you START with Other M!?
[4:35:08] <+gustavozxd> FIRST!? Oh god
[4:35:09] <%extradopeness> what about a hyper bomb
[4:35:13] <%scaryboisupreme> To be fair, power bombs are incredibly dangerous
[4:35:14] <+Grayhammatter> unknown resource
[4:35:17] <Blank9> samus you know how dangerous being able to withstand hot temperatures is, for other people
[4:35:19] <marvel877> Pat, you had Power Bombs in Prime.
[4:35:21] <SaltyAzteca> How much WATER
[4:35:22] <%SaiyanShoto> @scaryboisupreme when I think about how horrifying the sea is... You're right
[4:35:22] <miabyte> ADAM HADN'T AUTHORISED IT
[4:35:25] <$OfficerMods> alot of people started with other m
[4:35:26] <jorniev> YOU NEVER PLAYED METROID
[4:35:27] <%marusux> Man Other M was just the worst huh
[4:35:29] <+Emperor_Z> @Monkeyweed21 They're screw attack blocks. The thing the tutorial was talking about was the big green thing with the 5 locks
[4:35:30] <jorniev> YOU
[4:35:31] <+McDerpus> worse than flood, they can get technology with the right hosts
[4:35:31] <%GarbageNirvana> Gee Adam thanks for spoiling it
[4:35:32] <jorniev> NEVER
[4:35:35] <Tham1k> Take me by the hand
[4:35:35] <%twistedj3ster> Pat's blowing C4 on the sea floor
[4:35:36] <%JoshManVGH> So who was Adam to Samus? Mentor
[4:35:42] <+Grayhammatter> big bottom of the ocean
[4:35:43] <+emperri> underwater friends
[4:35:44] <akitanito> power bomb emmis where
[4:35:47] <%Monkeyweed21> @Emperor_Z oh ok got it
[4:35:50] <TIME_PUNCHER> the mariana stench
[4:35:52] <Asuterisuku> The one CO she got along with.
[4:35:53] <KingJackel> @JoshManVGH pretty much
[4:35:54] <Explodincatz> the ocean at the bottom of the sky
[4:35:54] <%X2Eliah> Living in an underwater base like that would be pretty neat
[4:35:57] <+gustavozxd> power bomb fishing is legal
[4:35:57] <%extradopeness> undereater base at the bottom of the ocean
[4:35:58] <markdreizehn> And even at the bottom of the ocean X PARASITES have taken over after like 1 hour free
[4:35:59] <+zuzuxiv> is an underground ocean still an ocean
[4:36:03] <brachydios777> Can we unify over Other M hate?
[4:36:04] <redwidow1358> Good because you'll be down here for the next three hours
[4:36:10] <%mostbrokenrobo> Fuck Adam
[4:36:12] <doggieo> Watch out for bobbits
[4:36:12] <jorniev> THE only thing at the botom of the ocean is dirt and nightmares
[4:36:13] <+Emperor_Z> @Paronoma Unfortunately, those tips only show up when loading your game, not after you die. So you'll rarely see them, maybe never if you use the suspend feature
[4:36:14] <%ShinobiPhoenix> it's not actually his first Metroid, he's messing with people, it's just the first 2D Metroid he likes enough to stay with, which I can undestand being used to modern conventions
[4:36:15] <marvel877> there's water at the bottom of the ocean
[4:36:21] <%scaryboisupreme> @JoshManVGH original JP script, mentor in friend. In the english translation they turned him into a daddy figure for some reason
[4:36:21] <Nocturnment> it's funny looking at the backgrounds of some of these levels. like, Samus, just take the stairs
[4:36:23] <%extradopeness> no fuck you i like other m now
[4:36:27] <%mostbrokenrobo> AI Adam alright tho
[4:36:33] <+gustavozxd> if you go power bomb fishing all the fish get blown up and then sucked into one neat convenient area
[4:36:48] <marvel877> bottom path is for when you fuck up, Pat.
[4:36:48] <@GeneralSCPatton> @nocturnment Oh man, you're right csbeastSetIn
[4:36:49] <%ShinobiPhoenix> I can't go back to old Sony 3D platformers at all
[4:37:00] <%scaryboisupreme> Well pat, you won't have to deal with that soon
[4:37:03] <fcKurl> i dont think what samus is doing is sustainable for the ocean
[4:37:09] <%scaryboisupreme> and it's gonna look REALLY cool
[4:37:12] <twoah> Samus is very anti-stairs because of the Chozo’s tube fetish
[4:37:12] <+emperri> heh balls
[4:37:14] <Louie_Salmon> Samus is fucking sonic?
[4:37:15] <%marusux> I mean that’s what it does
[4:37:16] <+McDerpus> I don't like to think about samus like, fucking sonic
[4:37:16] <+SolidusRex> Samus is fucking Sonic?
[4:37:16] <olaksi> stop it youll start a fanfic
[4:37:17] <%extradopeness> haha balls
[4:37:18] <wqorst> imagine seeing samus just randomly flipping through the ocean
[4:37:18] <Tham1k> You never see samus and soniv in the same room
[4:37:20] <brachydios777> Sonic with a gun
[4:37:23] <SaltyAzteca> samus X
[4:37:24] <akitanito> sussy
[4:37:34] <%TheLemuroid> Man just like the morph ball they really make you feel the lack of movement option before giving it to you
[4:37:34] <%SaiyanShoto> Watching people sequence break this game is great
[4:37:37] <%ShinobiPhoenix> I have to imagine most of Samus's weapons are bad for the environment
[4:37:38] <%scaryboisupreme> Difussion

[4:38:30] <+Grayhammatter> big boom
[4:38:33] <wqorst> samus is a menace
[4:38:35] <%ShinobiPhoenix> so who was maintaining all this stuff
[4:38:41] <+Grayhammatter> it certainly did

[4:38:45] <$OfficerMods> chozo
[4:38:45] <KingJackel> Oh, you're about to be real happy Pat :)
[4:38:47] <miabyte> feels like a dream to me... get it? because when you run sometimes it feels slow in dreams? no?
[4:38:49] <Onatamana> I like how after the X parasites are freed, even the enemies that have no new attacks or buffed forms still change their behavior is subtle ways, like the one eyed squid enemies that previously swam back and forth instead start swimming towards Samus slowly.
[4:38:49] <redwidow1358> Nobody was maintaining it.
[4:38:50] <%silvery_cricket> @ShinobiPhoenix Chozo terrorists

[4:40:16] <HelluvaNohbody> She looks like one of dem Evanjelly-ons
[4:40:16] <$OfficerMods> mmm gamecube blue
[4:40:17] <+MaliciousHero> @cooldude69xx That suit is purple, not blue
[4:40:20] <reonome> man, adam's voice is so cool
[4:40:20] <Nocturnment> Suit is definitely blue
[4:40:20] <+tomdwarf> @cooldude69xx But its purple...
[4:40:22] <%ShinobiPhoenix> if you look at like a Robot, you better be Purple and Green or Red and Black
[4:40:22] <%extradopeness> a step forward into terror!
[4:40:23] <%MrP33Ps> The gravity suit makes her faster in general, right?
[4:40:23] <%Andrizzleton> it's definitely blue lol
[4:40:24] <%greasypete00> they move fast
[4:40:26] <Asuterisuku> ALL living organisms.
[4:40:26] <%scaryboisupreme> No pat they're REALLY fast
[4:40:26] <%ShinobiPhoenix> X work fast
[4:40:27] <Blank9> the ENTIRE PLANET
[4:40:27] <%Buzzard42> NOW YOU KNOW MAN
[4:40:27] <brachydios777> That's fast
[4:40:28] <+Emperor_Z> That's kind of wild. How did the X travel to the opposite end of the planet already?
[4:40:28] <%cooldude69xx> Goddamn thats fast
[4:40:29] <wantedsafe471> lotta x
[4:40:29] <ElSuperNova> WELP
[4:40:30] <blue8moon> the ultimate bioweapon
[4:40:31] <+ReallyBigRocks> it's like the flood
[4:40:35] <%cvp5127> burn the plant dpwn
[4:40:35] <+MaliciousHero> The gravity suit is purple
[4:40:35] <Visorak6> 30 minute planet assimilation
[4:40:37] <%X2Eliah> Does it involve all bacteria?
[4:40:37] <zk_nails> X don't fuck around
[4:40:38] <brachydios777> Flood shit
[4:40:39] <+D00msDayDan> goodbye biosphere, it's all X now
[4:40:39] <+NickHatesSnow> They're a problem
[4:40:40] <+zuzuxiv> yeah it's super fucked
[4:40:41] <+JonathLP> That's "blow the planet up" solution
[4:40:42] <%DeepPix3l> Been like an hour. All is lodt
[4:40:42] <Ravingpyro> Ego the Living Planet bullshit
[4:40:43] <ammobasket> I'm not so much about the torso on this suit, but the rest is good.
[4:40:44] <%scaryboisupreme> X divide asexually so it's super quick
[4:40:45] <%dekkitout> Magical settings can have shit like that
[4:40:45] <%athuramn> @helluvanohbody LUL
[4:40:45] <+ReallyBigRocks> or all the other wack ass space parasites
[4:40:46] <ChaoticDaKiller> how the FUCK did Raven Beak manaage to contain the X????
[4:40:48] <Explodincatz> uhhhh Halo?
[4:40:49] <marvel877> They reproduce asexually
[4:40:49] <fistynopunches> how quick do reapers destroy a planet @PatStaresAt
[4:40:51] <%kyh9> I dunno, Resident Evil gets close
[4:40:57] <%DashXero> Not really. Self-replicating nanomachines pose the same threat.
[4:40:59] <Explodincatz> o right Pat never played Halo
[4:41:00] <+NickHatesSnow> Good thing Samus tool the vaccine
[4:41:05] <%Dova573> X parasites are TYRANINDS but in virus form
[4:41:07] <moonmeh> beaware of the unexpected is such a meaningless warning
[4:41:07] <+emperri> the fuck does gravity have to do with it being cold out
[4:41:07] <%DashXero> And we're trying to make those things.
[4:41:07] <+Slattsquatch> @ChaoticDaKiller His sheer gigachad energy prevented infection and warded them off
[4:41:12] <Nocturnment> In Pat's eyes: this suit is blue, base suit is green
[4:41:12] <%dekkitout> Reapers =/= Galactus in terms of speed
[4:41:12] <%Monkeyweed21> Reminder that Metroids were created to counter the X specifically
[4:41:13] <%scaryboisupreme> that suit looks so fucking cool
[4:41:13] <+BioStormX> Replicators from Stargate are that level of threat
[4:41:13] <superdude22> but it<s only midnight
[4:41:15] <wolfen091> lies
[4:41:16] <akitanito> long enough for an entire game
[4:41:16] <moonmeh> if its unexpedcted how can i prepare for it
[4:41:17] <%ForlornCarton> Good times
[4:41:17] <%Dova573> Fucking terrifying
[4:41:18] <Asuterisuku> What a videogame
[4:41:18] <redwidow1358> The X are an unbelievably powerful threat. They spread extremely fast. That's why Fusion was so dire. There were at least 13 SA-X on the BSL station.
[4:41:20] <SaltyAzteca> WHAT WAS THAT LUL
[4:41:20] <%MrP33Ps> GOOD GAME
[4:41:20] <%criticalink_> Dread so good
[4:41:23] <+ReallyBigRocks> @kyh9 RE is basically a space parasite origin story lol
[4:41:24] <Saltmeisterr> @PatStaresAt U have 1 more stream left
[4:41:24] <%extradopeness> nice stream
[4:41:26] <TheAntiNihilist> ALIENS
[4:41:27] <%TarikBot> THANKS FOR PLAYING
[4:41:27] <+red_cuppa> nini!!
[4:41:28] <+tomdwarf> To my knowledge, it takes them usually a few years, maybe a decade, to finish their galactic purging.
[4:41:30] <%NigelSchnauzerpug> How close is Pat to the end of the game?
[4:41:30] <moonmeh> what a good video game
[4:41:30] <%JoshManVGH> Woo!
[4:41:31] <wolfen091> finale?
[4:41:37] <wantedsafe471> welp, one blown up planet next stream
[4:41:38] <+brandanvh> Maybe ZDR is reeeal small
[4:41:38] <gygias10> before podcast?
[4:41:38] <+Rolandknight> reaper don't destroy plants
[4:41:41] <jonblnt> nice stream
[4:41:42] <Syrushmx> i miss the snarky comments from adam in fusion
[4:41:45] <+Peacefrog7> it takes months if for at least one planet the protheans fought for centuries @PatStaresAt
[4:41:46] <%ShinobiPhoenix> @ChaoticDaKiller I would say he got lucky because the soldier that got infected was already in a place they could lock
[4:41:49] <Asuterisuku> Seriously, who would START Metroid with Other M?
[4:41:49] <%scaryboisupreme> It's a planet
[4:41:51] <SaltyAzteca> You made some progress tonight for sure
[4:41:53] <KnivesEve> imagine if reapers had to deal with the X parasite
[4:41:54] <Gelphaze> Its like John carpenters THE THING!
[4:41:55] <redwidow1358> The X parasite is real fucking bad lol
[4:41:58] <wolfen091> x gonna give it to ya
[4:42:00] <reonome> don't worry about it
[4:42:05] <+Dappercat> is Samus basically Galactus? or Silver Surfer?
[4:42:06] <%X2Eliah> X parasite may be bad, but the Reapers set up concentration camps so who is wrose, really.
[4:42:08] <Onatamana> X would've just been confined to it's planet, but intelligent and self aware life just HAD to visit it and get infected.
[4:42:09] <%peachy996> X Parasite is the most adorable nightmare virus
[4:42:09] <%scaryboisupreme> Cables suck
[4:42:12] <miabyte> @patstaresat you should definitely play fusion
[4:42:13] <%peachy996> or parasite
[4:42:14] <Blank9> The Thing on steroids
[4:42:27] <%Monkeyweed21> @tomdwarf fully wiping out a galactic civilization and most traces of it takes several centuries for the Reapers
[4:42:36] <pokketlint60> Drummy tum tum
[4:42:38] <%AncelDeLambert> I 100% Dread before beating it, it just takes some time
[4:42:49] <Tham1k> what
[4:42:59] <%JoshManVGH> Oh that has to be awful
[4:43:02] <%Dova573> Xparasite would make mulptiple Sheperd clones
[4:43:05] <%TheHateFish> Sorry, what was that dude's name?
[4:43:12] <%scaryboisupreme> yeah my first playthough was 100% too
[4:43:12] <Asuterisuku> Not even true.
[4:43:13] <+tomdwarf> @Monkeyweed21 Thanks, didnt remember the lore behind it.
[4:43:23] <%peachy996> Ah but Woolie beat it in two big streams and you're on 3
[4:43:28] <%scaryboisupreme> Bane?
[4:43:29] <%SaiyanShoto> Pat is the Metroid
[4:43:48] <%notsoy> you know what the best improvised weapon is? a bicycle
[4:43:50] <%ShinobiPhoenix> I have been a fan of Metroid since 1, but really 2, and I didn't care about SHinesparking until this game because it felt right to try in honor of it being 20 years since
[4:43:51] <miabyte> miabyte subscribed with Prime. They've subscribed for 12 months! I resubbed to specifically suggest you play fusion, and definitely the fan game AM2R. They're so good.
[4:43:52] <%scaryboisupreme> Was donating to pat part of your master plan?
[4:43:55] <thestoreemporium> home improvements with a hammer?
[4:43:57] <+MaliciousHero> kitty
[4:43:57] <+red_cuppa> hi elmo

[4:44:10] <+lemon_lore> pat is thor

[4:44:44] <+bugz_munny> But you cant break me
[4:44:48] <%doc_ock_rokc> LEGAL ADVICE: If you keep a bat in your car KEEP A GLOVE AND A BALL AS WELL

[4:45:08] <%peachy996> Yeah the revelation that the Chozo have some assholes in the bunch
[4:45:13] <%MegadBlitz> dont say it
[4:45:14] <thestoreemporium> wait what are we making fun of pat for?
[4:45:14] <TIME_PUNCHER> after Samus beats the Metroids she must then face her newest foe, the Hemroids
[4:45:15] <redwidow1358> WHUSSY
[4:45:17] <Visorak6> You will never escape the whussy
[4:45:18] <+ReallyBigRocks> whussy will never die

[4:45:29] <%Bane_Kaikyo> @scaryboisupreme I DO have a Warhammer... and no I wouldn't die, but I'd be pissed cause I payed a lotta money for that... prolly beat you with my Oar and take it back
[4:45:34] <+bugz_munny> Is this another in-joke I missed
[4:45:35] <%DashXero> I don't think that works if you've hammered nails into your bat.
[4:45:38] <%scaryboisupreme> You're a big guy
[4:45:49] <%greasypete00> do you think youre gonna go for 100% on this playthrough/on stream
[4:45:51] <%criticalink_> you said this was your first 2D Metroid? did I hear that right?
[4:45:56] <+ReallyBigRocks> Pat Stares At Orienteering
[4:45:58] <+wizard_of_diamonds> HOMIE IN THE CUT WHERE THE WOOD AT
[4:46:02] <%TheHateFish> Wherever Woolie happens to have sold the most N Passes. That's where the hood at.
[4:46:03] <%dekkitout> If the area is redline, wel... then there you go...
[4:46:10] <%ShinobiPhoenix> Samus is basically if Ashley Williams was likeable and not a space racist, but still murders
[4:46:36] <+GalacticaPhanto> @shinobiphoenix and hot
[4:46:48] <%ShinobiPhoenix> I wonder if Samus even LIKES Earth
[4:46:53] <%Dova573> DONT EVEN COMPARED ASHLEY TO SAMUS
[4:46:54] <%peachy996> The Core when it's charging a beam at you
[4:46:58] <%Dova573> How dare
[4:47:01] <+ReallyBigRocks> pat, just do thing
[4:47:05] <+bugz_munny> LUL
[4:47:08] <redwidow1358> Understandable
[4:47:17] <%MegadBlitz> happy birthday!
[4:47:19] <+gustavozxd> next time I'll just say just do thing
[4:47:24] <%peachy996> Earth sucks
[4:47:31] <%ShinobiPhoenix> Earth isn't her home and she doesn't really have a home anymore and she probably doesn't hang around humans much
[4:47:37] <%scaryboisupreme> Are you gonna stream Prime 2 at some point? You seem to share my opinion that it rules
[4:47:39] <+ReallyBigRocks> all you gotta do is thing
[4:47:41] <%NigelSchnauzerpug> Have a good night Pat.
