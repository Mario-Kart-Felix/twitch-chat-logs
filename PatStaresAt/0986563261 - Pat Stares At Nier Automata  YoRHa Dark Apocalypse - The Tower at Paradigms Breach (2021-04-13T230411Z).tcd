[0:28:19] <%Scarnehu> hey Pat, how many hours a week would you say one would need to play to catch up to the current stuff without a jump potion?
[0:28:20] <%Alazull> Also isn't it nice to have an immediate resolution to their story beats
[0:28:35] <$RealThiele> i killed your wife, her eis mead
[0:28:36] <sonofthedeepsouth> good
[0:28:39] <jorniev> some one is gonna be either misssing and/or dead
[0:28:39] <T_Sasquatch> hahahahha
[0:28:40] <reonome> billion
[0:28:41] <$Futurecity10> 300 hours?
[0:28:42] <penitentpendant> 24
[0:28:43] <Psyramics> that's a nonsense question anyway
[0:28:44] <%AJ_Cherenkov> 4 figure hours
[0:28:44] <%BoxNavy> alot. but dont get a jump potion
[0:28:45] <T_Sasquatch> don't
[0:28:46] <+red_cuppa> loooooong time
[0:28:46] <@SSaryn> Like, 400-600 hours.
[0:28:47] <2DSuperiority> The Dwarf beast tribe shows as much
[0:28:48] <+bugz_munny> You got a good 300
[0:28:51] <iosephe> 300 hours probably
[0:28:51] <%czeekytv> 20 hours a week until Endwalker drops?
[0:28:52] <Dodolo212> a lot
[0:28:52] <+bugz_munny> Solid 300
[0:28:52] <Weadad1> at leas 11
[0:28:56] <sonofthedeepsouth> It will take weeks
[0:28:56] <%Alazull> Probably about three weeks? Eight hours a day
[0:28:57] <%velemi> I mean, a few hundred hours at least
[0:28:59] <%lucky_icarus> Yo, Bozja Fending gear? Nice taste!
[0:29:00] <sonofthedeepsouth> WEEKS
[0:29:01] <$RealThiele> LUL maybe
[0:29:01] <%SveriSageAdvice> i can say it took me a full month playing 6-7 hours a day
[0:29:06] <+Drspiderskull92> I'd say about 2-3weeks
[0:29:07] <%Mr_Pylon> I'm sorry for crippling your wife, here have a mug of mead that I carried here in the rain.
[0:29:09] <%caramelatte1> 2 months to get to Shadowbringers if you play like 5 days a week
[0:29:10] <Man_in_the_Red> if you start now you'll probably get to shadowbringers by endwalker
[0:29:11] <+Tetherline> A LOT
[0:29:12] <+Rorkdork> we bring drugs
[0:29:13] <Weadad1> if you watch every cut scene at least 300-450 hours
[0:29:16] <%Garthunox> probably 20 hours a week
[0:29:17] <%LeiaSkynoober> Yeah, it was about a month here
[0:29:18] <%MegboyManuel> daily, it took me 4 months to catch up to storm blood
[0:29:21] <2DSuperiority> wife in a coma, best time to drink
[0:29:22] <+Deosier> going from 2.0 to shadowbringers took just under a month or 2 of a few hours a day
[0:29:28] <shieldecho> ...But I brought the booze...
[0:29:29] <%JoshManVGH> 40 hours per expansion ish... plus how many hours the between expansions patch cycles run.
[0:29:29] <%Metii_Morst> I think my playtime hitting 80 was like 7-8 days
[0:29:29] <Man_in_the_Red> assuming its only MSQ and not the optional raids
[0:29:31] <%BoxNavy> ...Oh.
[0:29:31] <+red_cuppa> no even mead?!
[0:29:35] <%BigCoffee> If you play casually from now until june/july you can manage at 4 hours a day
[0:29:36] <%TimesApex> Get this woman a Replicant
[0:29:40] <%SShen> my friend went from start of ARR to the end of 5.3 in 3 weeks
[0:29:42] <%twoto858> FeelsBadMan
[0:29:43] <%BoxNavy> jermaPluto
[0:29:45] <%JoshManVGH> add 200 hours of dicking around.
[0:29:47] <%Garthunox> depends how far you get any day, and how often you get sidetracked
[0:29:49] <%BinaryFireball> what did he do to that man and his wife?
[0:29:49] <%HiroTSK5> Terrible day for rain
[0:29:55] <T_Sasquatch> realistically theres no point of rushing a multi hundred hour mmo just for nier shit
[0:29:57] <%TheDugness> Beat his ass
[0:30:03] <Srthunda> punch in that little door and chuck the mead in
[0:30:04] <$RealThiele> booze didnt work? oh no

[0:30:43] <%HiroTSK5> FF IV man
[0:30:44] <$RealThiele> lali-holy shit just add whatever you want -ho!
[0:30:48] <%lucky_icarus> my scene of this was a nice bright day. didn't leave the intended impact
[0:30:51] <Man_in_the_Red> dont let that dwarf drink normal water, he'll go berserk and kill your Clothier
[0:30:54] <%Garthunox> Stop calling me a ho!
[0:30:54] <+senfood> They talk like that evil Jojo baby.
[0:30:56] <%Tearonex> HEE HO SAYS JACK FROST

[0:31:45] <penitentpendant> Also, did Konogg just try to give a pregnant woman alcohol?
[0:31:47] <Shardlab> Undead abominations fix everything

[0:35:08] <sonofthedeepsouth> Use OPERA Kappa
[0:35:09] <T_Sasquatch> chrome deepthroats all your ram
[0:35:10] <+MayorRev> I heard Edge is just chrome but with less ram usage @PatStaresAt
[0:35:13] <+bugz_munny> but not as big of a PoS
[0:35:13] <+MyHandsAreBlank> Pat I'm trying to play FFXIV but I'm having a really hard time enjoying this early game. I'm playing some dungeons with people but its fairly repetitive. I'm playing a tank, and this is my first MMO. Any advice?
[0:35:15] <AurusD> firefox used to be good but the main good guy behind it left so now they track you and shif
[0:35:16] <%walternatorz> pat plays fortnite and uses edge

[0:36:16] <mr_saturday93> Also is this raid in the nier canon?
[0:36:17] <CenanRaergo> Such duty, this was not my collection.
[0:36:19] <$RealThiele> LUL
[0:36:21] <+MyHandsAreBlank> @kylejefferies Problem is I haven't really been enjoying the story
[0:36:24] <Kain5707> it's not used anymore I don't think

[0:36:58] <+terry_quest> the longest walk
[0:36:58] <%BinaryFireball> thrilling
[0:36:58] <%kylejefferies> @myhandsareblank What dungeon you do last?
[0:36:58] <%Blackleafx> Is Pat doing this quest for the first time or is he redoing it for our sake?
[0:37:03] <%JoshManVGH> It's so weird to see ACTUAL readouts on a computer screen in 14
[0:37:04] <%DorianCreed> @myhandsareblank The early game is not great, both in terms of story and gameplay. It does pick up a lot later on, worth noting.
[0:37:04] <Devbob98> Those memorable aliens
[0:37:05] <Psyramics> switch to ranged phys and peloton your way through
[0:37:09] <%superc37> @myhandsareblank its nier so takea guess
[0:37:12] <+RowenCleric> god I hope there is more drakengard
[0:37:13] <+Prism_Zet> drakengard 1 spoilers?
[0:37:13] <sonofthedeepsouth> Like I give a F
[0:37:14] <Srthunda> oh, I already spoiled myself years ago, im fine
[0:37:14] <%caramelatte1> Watched all the spoiler contents already
[0:37:15] <penitentpendant> Went through your Part 2 stream, I never noticed the two active Puppets listed in the bunker until you pointed it out
[0:37:18] <%AJ_Cherenkov> Do you know that?
[0:37:19] <T_Sasquatch> the final nier raid gave me sensory overload
[0:37:19] <+senfood> AND Drakengard???
[0:37:19] <Kain5707> like right now
[0:37:20] <garbageheaphound> Oh yeah it will
[0:37:20] <RaidenRising> aliens ? you are going to fight jiren ?
[0:37:21] <%invalid_robin> do we need to watch the other ff nicer stuff?
[0:37:21] <%HiroTSK5> Has it spoiled Drakengard yet? I don't remember
[0:37:24] <+fetrigon> Don't tell me what to do! PunOko
[0:37:25] <Spudnacious_Dynasty> Shit, Drakengard spoilers? Oh no
[0:37:25] <+deadredeyez> well so long chat
[0:37:25] <tattleworm> no human cares about drakengard spoilers
[0:37:26] <%invalid_robin> nier*
[0:37:28] <+bugz_munny> All of Drakengard
[0:37:28] <%AzureGale> Oh no, they're going to spoil a game that the raid is all about!
[0:37:28] <SomeOtherNeb> am I gonna be fine for Nier Replicant spoilers?
[0:37:28] <yourliteraldog> Is space jam 2 canon to the saga of Hoops Barkley
[0:37:29] <2DSuperiority> Need all of Drakenguard, Nier and all novels playshows and manga
[0:37:29] <+MelodyMedley> Heya Pat! What do you think about the new Fortnite update?
[0:37:30] <+Rorkdork> I had to watch clemps videos for drakengard
[0:37:34] <AurusD> hell we might go back to drag on dragoon spoilers
[0:37:35] <Devbob98> If they cared, they wouldâ€™ve played it at this point
[0:37:35] <mr_saturday93> I wouldn't be surprised if this was canon to nier
[0:37:36] <Man_in_the_Red> its a weird form of spoiler where it isnt new information, just stuff that only makes sense if you know info ahead of time
[0:37:36] <%Monkeyweed21> I liked the part of the patch where Alphinaud pooped his pants while streaming Mafia 3
[0:37:37] <$RealThiele> time to fight children is now
[0:37:40] <%lucky_icarus> I wish I had played those games prior to this cause what would've been pop offs just didn't land.
[0:37:45] <%MegboyManuel> Just watch Clemp's video to get caught up on Nier, EZ
[0:37:46] <%Xelhesia> in like 5 seconds
[0:37:48] <Spudnacious_Dynasty> The only people who would care about drakengard spoilers have already played all the drakengards
[0:37:49] <TsundereFFXIV> EVERY boss in this raid is a huge spoiler
[0:37:50] <%superc37> @mr_saturday93 its nier so take a guess
[0:37:51] <+MyHandsAreBlank> @kylejefferies Uhh, I think Into the beast maw
[0:37:55] <%jinking79> I gave up my save to help some random

[0:38:00] <+snausages_> The raids aren't canon to nier but the references could spoil I guess
[0:38:00] <yourliteraldog> Stupid Sex Machines

[0:55:41] <%RigmaroleHM> @RWLJr98 FFXIV and Nier crossover
[0:55:45] <+Prism_Zet> was that a flying panda
[0:55:50] <gnarly_memes_bro> @patstaresat it doesn't matter the ending where you don't do bunker isn't cannon
[0:55:51] <yourliteraldog> Racist as potatos
[0:55:54] <penitentpendant> "I killed the people who did this to you. I CAN be worse to you if you anger me."
[0:55:59] <yourliteraldog> Book of Grudges

[0:56:35] <T_Sasquatch> Theme of Mystery
[0:56:38] <%AzureGale> Is it as overused as Yakuza's theme of SAD
[0:56:40] <+bugz_munny> music of suspicion
[0:56:49] <%velemi> listen they paid a lot of money to compose this track
[0:56:50] <%Nordguy> what if the person 2B saw was just Yoshi P
[0:56:55] <%HiroTSK5> Again
[0:56:56] <2DSuperiority> lali hee ho
[0:56:58] <Kain5707> @patstaresat did you see Nier on steam is getting patched, what a coincidence
[0:56:58] <%velemi> they gotta get their money's worth
[0:57:04] <penitentpendant> To the Unfertilized Egg!

[0:57:13] <+bugz_munny> They used every penny lol
[0:57:14] <DexteraXIII> Cool and Eldritch
[0:57:33] <Devbob98> How about a dragon tower
[0:57:35] <RWLJr98> Duh
[0:57:44] <skyentombment> WAIT
[0:57:47] <+red_cuppa> worse than a bad feeling. a familiar bad feeling
[0:57:53] <+trizetacannon44> I didn't grab this quest when I did it. Ran all the way and had to do it again.
[0:58:02] <%HiroTSK5> WoL don't need anyone slowing them down
[0:58:03] <AurusD> HERE WE GO
[0:58:06] <sonofthedeepsouth> Lets go father potato
[0:58:08] <%Blackleafx> alright now go all the way back down AGAIN
[0:58:11] <T_Sasquatch> btw did the choice even matter of which twin to pick ?
[0:58:13] <+pectusumbra> those dwarves are super dead of yoko taro syndrome
[0:58:19] <skyentombment> IS THAT THE BASE FROM AUTOMATA?
[0:58:23] <penitentpendant> Get that sprint on cooldown
[0:58:23] <%AJ_Cherenkov> *me and my two dozen friends can handle it
[0:58:23] <%ChestMimik> Oh is that the android spacehouse?
[0:58:23] <AurusD> ETA to popoff, 10 mins
[0:58:24] <%doc_ock_rokc> papa smurf
[0:58:25] <RWLJr98> This is so bizarre man
[0:58:26] <penitentpendant> Yeehaw
[0:58:26] <+twohitgood> is this facade?
[0:58:27] <SaltyAzteca> Wait, this is the Tower ruins?
[0:58:29] <%JoshManVGH> Yep
[0:58:31] <sonofthedeepsouth> It sure was
[0:58:31] <TioXyco> @skyentombment yeah, the Bunker
[0:58:35] <%AJ_Cherenkov> @skyentombment ys
[0:58:47] <%ClericOfSparda> The fact that this place is empty tells me everyone gets their own instance for this part
[0:58:52] <skyentombment> So, ostenstibly, we could find some trojan'd androids in here
[0:58:52] <%ChestMimik> Is this what happened to Tomato Town?
[0:58:52] <+gantz_zero> but i thought music was for idiots
[0:58:53] <%HiroTSK5> Tower/Bipolar Nightmare are so good
[0:58:57] <rekinom> Hmmm, do I wait for a mansion to be available, or do I buy the solid gold namazu mount??
[0:59:02] <Devbob98> I need the carnival music to blast
[0:59:11] <%asgard147> Did the androids and machines litterally Crash on ff14's world?
[0:59:16] <SaltyAzteca> I thought the Bunker exploded completely, im surprised
[0:59:17] <%Garthunox> @rekinom Wait for the mansion
[0:59:20] <+bugz_munny> this is an emptied out version of the previous raid
[0:59:22] <skyentombment> Sounds like it
[0:59:24] <ScreamLord> The Nier stuff in this is techincally a sequel to Automata isn't it?
[0:59:24] <penitentpendant> @rekinom Mansion, the mount is... uh... go look at a video of it
[0:59:25] <%doc_ock_rokc> @ChestMimik Tomato town has been squashed. try to ketchup
[0:59:26] <KatabolicRage> man I don't like the regular namazu mount, gold plating it just makes it extra shit to me
[0:59:26] <%caramelatte1> Well you genocided everything
[0:59:29] <T_Sasquatch> @asgard147 ye
[0:59:34] <%ClericOfSparda> @rekinom Mansion
[0:59:37] <%BigCoffee> @asgard147 seems like so, so far
[0:59:51] <+projectmanatees> Did you not get the collectibles?
[0:59:51] <SaltyAzteca> OH THE CORRIDOR
[0:59:52] <JeysJumbleJams> @rekinom which is cooler, a house or a mount? i have not played ffxiv
[0:59:52] <sonofthedeepsouth> Dont think about
[0:59:55] <rekinom> hmmm
[0:59:59] <%AzureGale> So it's like Seinfeld's apartment
[1:00:02] <%RetroCop87> @PatStaresAt did you ever see the right side of the room in Nier?
[1:00:04] <%twoto858> Nier freaks me out so much for some reason
[1:00:06] <TioXyco> I'd say there's a base underground, and them the Bunker crashed into it
[1:00:07] <Devbob98> Probably snapped
[1:00:07] <rekinom> I guess I do have a lot of mounts already
[1:00:07] <KatabolicRage> the whole thing was never designed along a single plane in the first place
[1:00:09] <+RowenCleric> didnt it like split in half and kinda unfold?
[1:00:12] <%ChestMimik> @doc_ock_rokc I refuse to be anything other than out of touch. I go at my own paste
[1:00:14] <blitzmentalist> yeah that's weird isn't it :)
[1:00:14] <rekinom> but I do want Golden Wasshoi Requiem
[1:00:18] <skyentombment> Oh your HUD does the Nier sounds!
[1:00:20] <Namillus> Why is the lighting normal though
[1:00:23] <skyentombment> Thats a col detail
[1:00:32] <VirtuaRailith> I always feel like Clemps should be here as a rat in the corner telling you the plot of the stage play
[1:00:34] <+Prism_Zet> salt potatos
[1:00:37] <%asgard147> Oh that wacky Yoko Taro
[1:00:38] <%ChestMimik> Five bucks it's Nierman
[1:00:39] <sonofthedeepsouth> Build that atmosphere
[1:00:39] <T_Sasquatch> its a long journey
[1:00:40] <SaltyAzteca> This looks like the alien ship detail
[1:00:42] <Ciglossonjr> Classic Yoko Taro tension builder
[1:00:48] <shieldecho> Fucked up and creepy? In a Nier title? That's just absurd.
[1:00:49] <+fetrigon> oh boy
[1:00:50] <+Kyma1020> Probably because of space and the androids had magnetic feet?
[1:00:51] <%ClericOfSparda> I'm gonna have to run through using a dps so its faster
[1:00:51] <TioXyco> @SaltyAzteca because it is
[1:00:53] <+fetrigon> KomodoHype KomodoHype KomodoHype
[1:00:55] <%ssjklyco> I wonder if we're gonna visit the sperm moon from Nier
[1:00:55] <sonofthedeepsouth> When is the ff14 stage play?
[1:00:57] <Ciglossonjr> Walk through the places you've been to ruminate
[1:00:59] <PinkGatsu> the hallway might be too big?
[1:01:01] <Devbob98> Youâ€™ll see a butt
[1:01:06] <%BoxNavy> :)
[1:01:06] <+fetrigon> it fine

[1:01:21] <%AzureGale> Twitch is trying to silence us
[1:01:24] <DexteraXIII> That's probably for the best
[1:01:26] <TioXyco> @SaltyAzteca Don't worryabout it :)
[1:01:26] <%psidefx> refresh?

[1:05:32] <sonofthedeepsouth> Thats right 2b
[1:05:32] <shieldecho> Oh Nines.
[1:05:32] <+twohitgood> it'd be hilarious if they use a yoko taro storyline to end the world of ff14.
[1:05:33] <penitentpendant> "Saved" him, with our swords
[1:05:35] <%Deft_Thought> "saved" 9s

[1:05:40] <Basch71> by save you mean kick the shit out of him, sure
[1:05:41] <%Valdorick> In before the plot twist is they're hooked up to a FF14 server in the Nier version of Earth.

[1:05:46] <%superc37> im still confused as to where this exists on the timeline
[1:05:47] <sonofthedeepsouth> But its impossible 2b
[1:05:48] <%JoshManVGH> I feel like the Asciens would take 2Ps plan personally

[1:06:13] <%AzureGale> What is with these dialogue options that don't matter
[1:06:21] <skyentombment> So, does nines still wanna **** 2b or is that in the past now that they're big free now?
[1:06:23] <%Calenrow> are anogg and konogg a koshi-roshi kinda thing?
[1:06:29] <%rumtumtugnutz> is the WoD flirting with the robot dwarf?
[1:06:29] <+Noir_Valdr> I feel like ANogg isn't gonna last
[1:06:30] <+Saunt> Has anyone noticed the oogs without helm have the same colour scheme and Devola and Popola?
[1:06:34] <T_Sasquatch> @AzureGale 4th wall breaks mostly
