[0:30:01] <+emperordread> @northstarotaku11 you mean Brotheringyou?
[0:30:01] <+Boomdiah> what is your favourite poison Pat
[0:30:03] <GarbageQueenEllie> She's prolly just filling the containers up with unused tap water, too
[0:30:08] <%solomonpun> Bacteria is built to destroy the hooman
[0:30:19] <northstarotaku11> it's doing damage to my eardrums over time lol
[0:30:19] <%ElenaManetta> So when you were running from the homeless with syringes, you were really running from their filthy hands
[0:30:19] <%captinkeyes> captinkeyes subscribed with Twitch Prime. They've subscribed for 7 months, currently on a 7 month streak! 
[0:30:20] <alrobot2014> its way scarier because we don't know whats in the bacteria evil, we know what's in the synthetic evil
[0:30:27] <ExpressNode> She does mention that it's not to drink it for sentimental value
[0:30:30] <collindoucet99> @angriestpat what do you think of the Witcher Netflix show images?
[0:30:34] <%Valdorick> We can't get any Elmo Bath Water, because it has essence of elmo in it, and that means Elmo will drink it all, because he is his own favorite food.
[0:30:44] <ClumzyDragon> !! Bacteria !!
[0:30:48] <%Maids4lyfe> wait I just got here are people drinking bathwater?
[0:30:50] <%Gogogolem> @AngriestPat Drinking bathwater can cause you suffer from a death refereed to as Dry drowning. Because the soap in the water causes your lungs fill with fluid to try and get the soap out but it cant.
[0:30:53] <northstarotaku11> emp gotta be quicker than that lol
[0:30:55] <+Lost_Zombie> I really love how the models of these guys are just XI's Ark Angels
[0:30:59] <Aristotlay> How related is the netflix show?
[0:31:03] <kvassimoto> The necklace is a flat coin :(
[0:31:16] <collindoucet99> @aristotlay only based on the books
[0:31:16] <northstarotaku11> pat how you feel about Superman playing gerry
[0:31:25] <Aristotlay> So are the games...??
[0:31:33] <collindoucet99> Henry Cavill actually looks good
[0:31:52] <%Yadogari> Oh shit Pat is streaming
[0:31:59] <collindoucet99> @aristotlay the games take place after the last book and aren’t technically considered canon.
[0:32:12] <northstarotaku11> he looks better now than those original pictures of him.
[0:32:25] <Aristotlay> Ah. Is it because the author is famously old and shitty?
[0:32:28] <collindoucet99> There might be visual inspiration but, the plot of the games definitely won’t be in the show. @aristotlay
[0:32:52] <collindoucet99> @aristotlay he’s actually a consultant for the show
[0:33:08] <ClumzyDragon> please hear my tragic backstory so you feel sad
[0:33:19] <northstarotaku11> They lived long enough to become the villains, now they must die...
[0:33:25] <%Valdorick> Oof, that rough.
[0:33:31] <Sol_Install> that sucks

[0:35:00] <%Gogogolem> What was it plague said, learning to be done with something is the hardest thing for an artist to learn

[0:42:47] <%Valdorick> God, is kinda Fane-ish, huh?

[0:42:54] <%TG_Cid11> Emet a cool guy
[0:43:05] <Aristotlay> Fane-ish is a good call

[0:46:05] <%ElenaManetta> so it's a SHADOW version of you

[0:48:52] <%Afterman_> it's like breaking a jar.. and then someone being mad you put it back together
[0:48:53] <%ElenaManetta> If an alien came to Earth and admitted to genociding his planet, is Earth responsible for putting him on trial for crimes against the universe
[0:48:53] <%Roundelay11> Thats a pretty good insult, not gonna lie
[0:48:53] <ShichiNoBushi> That's not how law works.
[0:48:54] <kvassimoto> it's like crushing a foot for this guy
[0:48:55] <collindoucet99> I fucking love that LOGIC
[0:48:57] <GarbageQueenEllie> You sir are no Monika
[0:48:59] <vaan_ratsbane> to an ascian, every death by aging is a murder by hydaelyn
[0:49:04] <+Noponiz> that line is godlike
[0:49:08] <%solomonpun> He see's killing people the same as stepping on an ant.
[0:49:08] <KatabolicRage> pretty much yeah
[0:49:10] <+textandnumbers> three fifths
[0:49:13] <%Typhaeon> There's a short joke to be made there
[0:49:13] <alrobot2014> no you're 1/13 a person
[0:49:14] <%Afterman_> 1/13th of a person isn't a person. it's like a toenail
[0:49:17] <%Gogogolem> its not wrong to murder Cats. Says the sociopath.
[0:49:18] <gekizenbu> or a fourteenth
[0:49:20] <bear_breaker20> like 63% person
[0:49:26] <%Maids4lyfe> you're 1/14th a person
[0:49:27] <%Misum> Misum subscribed at Tier 1. 
[0:49:29] <%TaifuDragon> wait what the fuck, is that why we're strong??? We're 6 PARTS OF THE WARRIOR OF LIGHT???
[0:49:31] <KatabolicRage> no it's 7/13th's, 7 shards got rejoined
[0:49:37] <%Afterman_> pat is a living toenail
[0:49:38] <alrobot2014> right
[0:49:39] <%Maids4lyfe> oh right
[0:49:42] <gekizenbu> at least its not three fifths
[0:49:44] <alrobot2014> so we are half a person
[0:49:44] <+BubbaRands> How can I kill 3/5's of a person?
[0:49:45] <%Fidel_Castbro> Nah like 4/7 a person
[0:49:49] <%TaifuDragon> IS THAT ALL IT IS
[0:50:00] <collindoucet99> But he’s a charismatic asshole
[0:50:01] <%Typhaeon> Welcome back waifu
[0:50:02] <Flickerember> Man whats her accent
[0:50:05] <%Valdorick> I for one welcome his plan, so that we can get to Final Fantasy Tactics and Vagrant Story Kappa
[0:50:08] <%Maids4lyfe> Vauthry rolling over monkaS
[0:50:08] <pochiyeah> big boi eating erybody
[0:50:11] <collindoucet99> Is that LUCIA?
[0:50:14] <%Afterman_> I love her accent
[0:50:15] <%Gogogolem> Fort Jobber fell
[0:50:21] <%ElenaManetta> That broken leg almost contributed to a mental break down, I'm glad it healed
[0:50:28] <%Roundelay11> The impression I get with him is more that he was driven incredibly insane by both the tradgedy of his people and the thousands of years of solitude he's lived through.
[0:50:32] <%TaifuDragon> her accent is almost like, israeli
[0:50:35] <Flickerember> I dont dislike Im just like I KNOW IT WHATS IT CALLED WHATS IT CALLED
[0:50:46] <collindoucet99> She sounds like Lucia from DMC2
[0:50:47] <Flickerember> He got majima'd
[0:50:49] <RetroDLC> 'lo
[0:50:56] <DeathGodSkeith> her accent is icelandic, like most viera
[0:51:03] <%Kirby_Sauce> Cheer500 i love how I came to the same conclusion, but via different methods. Merge the planets under controled circumstances to mitigate the loss of life to millions over a few years, as opposed to trillions over eons.

[0:51:10] <%Afterman_> ok so. emet is a hero. where do we go from here
[0:51:19] <Flickerember> Stomp the hero
[0:51:24] <%TG_Cid11> down
[0:51:24] <%Maids4lyfe> every villain is a hero in their own story
[0:51:27] <Flickerember> Show everyone how big we are
[0:51:36] <$SleepyMaribo> Emet feels so kefka like, and its making me like the ascions...
[0:51:37] <%Afterman_> it's like trying to undo the Thanos snap
[0:51:44] <%solomonpun> @Kirby_Sauce That logic requires you to value the people dying as mattering.
[0:51:45] <%Roundelay11> You'll learn a whole lot more about that stuff later
[0:51:50] <%TG_Cid11> @AngriestPat he is there
[0:51:55] <%Valdorick> Emet > Hand clasping - Murdering millions to merge your planet with theirs and save your race < Garland from FF9
[0:51:57] <%Gogogolem> Emet went to jerk off infront of a mirrior
[0:51:57] <%theturtlebar> Pat he was there
[0:51:59] <%Honaoko> He is there
[0:52:01] <%theturtlebar> He was in the room

[0:52:20] <+meatgeneral69> he’s in the room
[0:52:20] <collindoucet99> Very rarely are fights caused by Good vs Evil. A lot of the time it’s someone’s good vs someone else’s good
[0:52:23] <%ovan20> apatBig apatLiz
[0:52:25] <ClumzyDragon> rooBlind
[0:52:26] <Zebroneath> Oooh yay

[0:52:36] <%TG_Cid11> @AngriestPat Go in and turn left
[0:52:38] <%ovan20> the Paige virus is at loose D:
[0:52:39] <KatabolicRage> wow, ytmnd reference
[0:52:40] <kanodin> pat is baba
[0:52:41] <Flickerember> Dunno if this will work but @angriestpat a lv79 quest makes you complete role quest that is 80. dunno if you know but wanted to save you time and keep hype going
[0:52:44] <%doc_ock_rokc> Pat is Page
[0:52:45] <%ElenaManetta> i hope pat changes his sub icon to a closed eye
[0:52:48] <%doc_ock_rokc> Page is you
[0:52:50] <bestwaifuritsu> @AngriestPat I just listened to the podcast and heard the bit about the healer spamming malefic and died laughing. Props to not becoming enraged after the second wipe lol.
[0:52:52] <+BubbaRands> @AngriestPat Why is there mustard in your hands?
[0:52:53] <ShichiNoBushi> How many pairs of glasses have you broken, Pat?
[0:52:59] <%Roundelay11> Soon it'll progress from incest to masturbation
[0:53:01] <%ovan20> LuL
[0:53:02] <Flickerember> Paige is from the 1st and Pat is source
[0:53:03] <%Gogogolem> Hey Emet
[0:53:17] <collindoucet99> How many glasses have you overprescribed?
[0:53:21] <+ItsYaGirlMaria> i think youll hit pretty close to 80 by the time you hit that
[0:53:22] <%Fatmanjoggin> Yeah you are gonna make it
[0:53:24] <%Misum> you will 100% get there without grinding
[0:53:29] <vaan_ratsbane> yeah you're good to go, specially with the dungeon
[0:53:30] <Angry_Ev1L> He'll be 80 by time he get there 100%
[0:53:31] <Flickerember> Ok das good. on phone so couldnt see
[0:53:42] <Flickerember> very tiny writing
[0:53:45] <%Misum> i just got to it now and only had like, 20% left to 80, you're a full level ahead of where i was at this point
[0:54:01] <%TG_Cid11> yeah its the MSQ part that makes you do your role quest
[0:54:09] <pochiyeah> official release is today? queues are back
[0:54:13] <%Afterman_> so there ARE ZOTHER PAT'S
[0:54:20] <%Afterman_> other *
[0:54:35] <%doc_ock_rokc> His real name is... Patron!
[0:54:41] <Flickerember> I dont even want to hint really cause I want as many OH SHIT moments
[0:54:42] <GarbageQueenEllie> This guy is sad
[0:54:49] <%Honaoko> Basically,as you are 1/13 of person,for example,Nabriales we encountered,was 1/13 of an Ascian.
[0:54:50] <%Diabetic> His real name is Roxas
[0:54:51] <vaan_ratsbane> beetchyup
[0:54:52] <+Noponiz> his real name is darlington, he's just embarassed
[0:54:56] <SailingSaturn> Big Murder cirSlain
[0:54:57] <KatabolicRage> after so much mysteriousness from asciens it's somewhat refreshing to have one just casually tell you shit
[0:54:57] <%ElenaManetta> That weird fighting gam
[0:54:59] <%ElenaManetta> game even
[0:55:01] <ShichiNoBushi> War Gods?
[0:55:03] <%Afterman_> pat is gonna become an ascian I bet.
[0:55:09] <Flickerember> Um something 3dish
[0:55:09] <+BubbaRands> xXx69PussSlayerx69Xx is Emet's true name
[0:55:12] <$i_am_therydon> it was a fighting game about old school monsters
[0:55:16] <%ElenaManetta> kILLING ZONE
[0:55:17] <%ElenaManetta> i remember
[0:55:19] <%weissguard> His name... is Dante. *skates away*
[0:55:20] <%Gogogolem> Have we beat his ass like five times now?
[0:55:23] <%Roundelay11> Emet is the most reasonable of the Ascians, but also the most crushingly depressed
[0:55:24] <+OmegaFatalis> wasn't it that crazy Russian game?
[0:55:25] <%TG_Cid11> @AngriestPat you learn it at the end of MSQ and its dope as fuck
[0:55:46] <KatabolicRage> to be fair pat the crystal braves REALLY fucked up the scions
[0:55:58] <Flickerember> Can we have Emet ride pass in a cutscene on a skateboard now?
[0:55:59] <+Williamld> Hasn't it been way less time in the story?
[0:56:07] <GarbageQueenEllie> Follow Baseball
[0:56:15] <ShichiNoBushi> "Junji"?
[0:56:17] <%Kirby_Sauce> @solomonpun that's why i said different methods. Merges are gonna happen anyway.
[0:56:38] <The_wafflizer> Put Elmo on the cam
[0:56:38] <%TaifuDragon> Emet rides past on heelys and you just go "Hey where did you get those" and he smugs at you
[0:56:47] <Flickerember> This battle music too strong for me
[0:56:51] <%Gogogolem> Why don't we just tie Emet to a stick and use him to beat the light wardens with.
[0:56:58] <%TG_Cid11> @AngriestPat Emet has a sick tony hawk minigame later fyi
[0:56:58] <Flickerember> Almost makes me wanna fight stuff. Almost.
[0:57:00] <ShichiNoBushi> So a Junji-esque ginger?
[0:57:03] <Flickerember> OH YEAH THIS BIT
[0:57:12] <bear_breaker20> are ascians just assholes who kill people cause of the 1/13th person meme ?
[0:57:15] <Flickerember> fook accidental hint mah bad
[0:57:16] <vaan_ratsbane> do the thriller
[0:57:21] <+drwhofan999> man trying to get to "before the dawn" is taking much longer then i thought it would
[0:57:25] <$KnivesEve> woah
[0:57:26] <Flickerember> tryna keep hype down
[0:57:48] <%JGardner88> Primordial Load Times
[0:57:52] <Flickerember> Casual soul steal
[0:57:59] <KatabolicRage> more like they blow up planets to merge them with another planet and cause massive disasters on that planet by doing so, but on teh upside everyone gets a fourteenth of their soul back!
[0:58:15] <MagicHatss> that sounds like a bargain
[0:58:28] <bear_breaker20> sound like parasites too pussy to die
[0:58:36] <GarbageQueenEllie> Why don't we take the planets, and PUSH them somewhere else?
[0:58:44] <ClumzyDragon> ^
[0:58:55] <bear_breaker20> good ideas finallly^
[0:59:02] <%Maids4lyfe> so basically what Jenova does?
[0:59:17] <DeathGodSkeith> because the planets dont exist on the same planes
[0:59:24] <DeathGodSkeith> they are literally in different dimensions
[0:59:32] <$SleepyMaribo> it IS a cult!
[0:59:50] <Hidashi13> look at those traps
[0:59:52] <%Maids4lyfe> don't drink the koolaid PrideGive
[0:59:57] <bestwaifuritsu> instead of koolaid it was bread
[1:00:01] <Flickerember> Ready yer oh shit face
[1:00:08] <GarbageQueenEllie> Nice Alice in Wonderland reference, Alphanerd
[1:00:11] <AdmiralButtloaf> meol is made of bepis
[1:00:16] <%Valdorick> Don't drink Vauthry's bath water
[1:00:19] <bear_breaker20> instead of coolaid potatoes
[1:00:27] <Flickerember> I thought Meol was a dumpling
[1:00:32] <Hidashi13> their eyes are too glossy
[1:00:34] <Flickerember> or pork bun type deal
[1:00:43] <alrobot2014> its super probably vauthry
[1:00:44] <%VantomPayne> 50% Light 50% Fat
[1:00:49] <%Maids4lyfe> apatGib
[1:00:56] <vaan_ratsbane> 100% Fat Evil
[1:01:03] <alrobot2014> maybe that explains his face nipple and pale skin near it
[1:01:04] <bestwaifuritsu> LUL
[1:01:07] <MagicHatss> wow
[1:01:09] <KatabolicRage> she gets really annoyed by that
[1:01:09] <$NitronStreams> LUL LUL LUL
[1:01:10] <%VantomPayne> every expansion
[1:01:12] <%VantomPayne> they have to do it
[1:01:12] <GarbageQueenEllie> Aw, come on, man
[1:01:14] <Sol_Install> LUL
[1:01:20] <%Afterman_> LUL
[1:01:24] <+YourPalFrost> HeyGuys
[1:01:26] <Flickerember> spreads like bad cholesterol but tastes like good cholesterol
[1:01:26] <bestwaifuritsu> The Pixies wanted them to swap clothes to fuck with people
[1:01:38] <haisho> somebody call Jandelaine to fix this problem for Alphinaud
[1:01:55] <%TG_Cid11> Ok so what the Ascians are trying to do is rejoin all the worlds. Each of the Umbral eras is a rejoining that took place. The main goal is to recreate the main world and bring back everyone as a "whole" soul
[1:02:05] <%Maids4lyfe> maybe if one of them cut their hair different they won't get confused for the other
[1:02:06] <%Yadogari> WOOLIE
[1:02:11] <KatabolicRage> I'm a britbong but good god that is one regional accent

[1:03:37] <TsundereFFXIV> Soylent Meol is Sin Eaters
[1:03:38] <+Noponiz> so it's a perpetual motion cannibalism mind control machine
[1:03:38] <%VantomPayne> oh its not over yet
[1:03:38] <%Afterman_> I bet he turns people into eaters to turn then into food
[1:03:42] <ClumzyDragon> what a twist
[1:03:47] <snowmanse> It all looks like butts.
[1:03:48] <%Valdorick> The Sin Eater becomes the Sin Eaten.

[1:08:07] <Thalchampz> that's straigh up Soul Edge
[1:08:13] <Hidashi13> is shadow bringers an allegory on how yoshi p is killing people left and right?
[1:08:19] <%Kirby_Sauce> Cheer500 not by old age. It's safe to assume shit's gonna get ruined anyway, some asshole will enact a plot that'll cause imbalance and a world gets consumed, better to do them all at once and under controlled circumstances than let it happen naturally over eons.
[1:08:20] <%Kirby_Sauce> reward A Cheer shared Rewards to 10 others in Chat!
[1:08:21] <%Fidel_Castbro> Pat you can’t just kill civilians that’s a war crime
[1:08:26] <%VantomPayne> People can ONLY die in cutscene, its the Yakuzie rules
[1:08:27] <Ozmodyas> Just be like Kiryu
[1:08:28] <VirtuallyCanadian> she can go anywhere and do anything she wants and nothing will stop her @shadic7700
[1:08:29] <TioXyco> TO SHINE
[1:08:35] <$NitronStreams> look at all this not killing
[1:08:35] <$Yakobro> LOL
[1:08:37] <Flickerember> dec
[1:08:39] <vaan_ratsbane> imagine talking trash to mind controller innocents LUL
[1:08:41] <bear_breaker20> blunt side of the magic sword
[1:08:42] <$Yakobro> to shreds you say...
[1:08:42] <alrobot2014> half hp fools
[1:08:43] <Flickerember> decapitate safely
[1:08:46] <%VantomPayne> Heat Action
[1:08:47] <artoflec> is this the next dungeon i just wanna see the dungeons 👀
[1:08:49] <+ItsYaGirlMaria> "Do no more than necessary, so just splash them with darkness"
[1:08:55] <kvassimoto> disembowel them, but not too much
[1:08:58] <%Toast_Master_General> Oh shit Pat I like your new sword
[1:09:03] <%Jarvanii> if they're on their knees they're alive, if sprawled on the ground they're dead
[1:09:21] <$i_am_therydon> cant progress without MURDER
[1:09:23] <haisho> Avoid harming them, hit them with the move called BLOODSPILLER
[1:09:23] <GarbageQueenEllie> Yeah ok
[1:09:29] <vaan_ratsbane> the next dungeon is 1-2h away depending on how fast Pat goes
[1:09:30] <%Maids4lyfe> it's fine, you declared nonlethal on your attack rolls
[1:09:36] <Flickerember> more blood for the blood god
[1:09:36] <bear_breaker20> basically you gotta kill civilians when overthrowing cannibals oops
[1:09:39] <+TripleHelix> The biocurse reaches FF D:
[1:09:42] <%Valdorick> Be sure to let them live with the knowledge they're apatBig cannibals! Its the humane thing to do.
[1:09:43] <Graxe_> "Don't kill them" is even more ridiculous as a BLM because you are literally burning them alive and blowing them up
[1:09:43] <%Razputin217> Rubber Sword
[1:09:48] <$SleepyMaribo> @AngriestPat so someone managed to do Parce on the trust npcs, Y'sholta has the lowest dps out of all the trust npcs lol
[1:09:50] <Ozmodyas> Don’t worry tis but a flesh wound
[1:10:01] <kvassimoto> Merely pretending to hurt them
[1:10:06] <%Diabetic> So pretty much the understanding I get is that: You guys win, you'll eventually merge the worlds but they'll be a combination of light and dark and you'll combine all the worlds but no one will die
[1:10:14] <BunnyEmperor> You will see why it is so Pat LUL
[1:10:28] <+TheImmortal70> Right? They're way weaker this way
[1:10:29] <Graxe_> Because they ate the meol
[1:10:34] <%Maids4lyfe> Vauthry is insane
[1:10:36] <%VantomPayne> same reason Uldah guards wont fight you probably
[1:10:36] <+Lost_Zombie> Cause fat boy is just a baby
[1:10:37] <haisho> because Vauthry is a dumdum
[1:10:41] <%demegodz> Woo, finally got the stream
[1:10:48] <%demegodz> Hour of getting ready for work is bleh
[1:10:51] <BunnyEmperor> Zorn and Thorn, engage
[1:10:55] <alrobot2014> does one cast flare

[1:14:38] <AgadezXX> but enough talk :V HAVE AT YOU
[1:14:40] <Flickerember> I believe in the man who id a sociopath
[1:14:41] <@Moobot> Whoa I don't even shout that much! (@ovan20) (warning)
[1:14:42] <%Razputin217> REJECT my HUMANITY
[1:14:44] <Thalchampz> that's a cool stance
[1:14:44] <+TheImmortal70> He's tired of thinking for himself and watching Minfilias die, so he'll cast his lot with Vauthry
[1:14:46] <%Valdorick> He only eats bitches and shit, and he already got his fill on bitches fighting Thancred Kappa
[1:14:51] <%Jarvanii> no conscience seems like descending more than ascending
[1:14:52] <%Diabetic> He is a really cool looking character though
[1:15:06] <+TheImmortal70> It's ascending when you're at your lowest point
[1:15:11] <%demegodz> @Diabetic Can't argue with that
[1:15:12] <%theturtlebar> He's probably the worst written character in the expansion
[1:15:21] <kanodin> everything except his motivation is really cool
[1:15:23] <%theturtlebar> A lot of potential, but boy do they make him dull
[1:15:28] <SailingSaturn> Darn tanks, dsp have to dodge that cirLaugh
[1:15:36] <SailingSaturn> Dps*
[1:15:53] <Thalchampz> i'm pretty sure they designed this around DK kit
[1:15:54] <Flickerember> Shoulder tackle makes it easy
[1:15:59] <haisho> man am I glad High Jump is a thing
[1:16:15] <haisho> not that I have it yet
[1:16:24] <Thalchampz> JESUS
[1:16:29] <Thalchampz> aoe hell
[1:16:30] <KatabolicRage> blackest night is STRONG man
[1:16:49] <vaan_ratsbane> tfw whm and assize one shots all the orbs at once FeelsGood
[1:16:49] <KatabolicRage> I sometimes get hit by aoe's on purpose with it on, for the free blood guage
[1:16:58] <%Valdorick> If he could do this cool shit, why didn't do it against Thancred?
[1:16:59] <%Jarvanii> this fight gives you free regen out the ass
[1:17:17] <kvassimoto> monkaS
[1:17:26] <LegendCobra> not even trying to avoid aoes lol
[1:17:41] <Flickerember> Build meter

[1:18:50] <BlueLunecy> Wasted LUL
[1:18:56] <CuriousReborn> Look at all of those 0s
[1:19:05] <KatabolicRage> cos thancred is a bitch
[1:19:06] <%Valdorick> The real question is - why did Thancred even try if you can hand this old man his ass, at his strongest, so easily?
[1:19:07] <%Yadogari> Too weak
[1:19:08] <LegendCobra> thancred is dumb
[1:19:11] <Thalchampz> because he's a bad tank
[1:19:14] <Fonarios> because thancred is dumb as hell
[1:19:20] <ashuckel> those bombs need some spell speed really bad lmao
[1:19:20] <$SleepyMaribo> that has to be a insta kill
[1:19:24] <Flickerember> Cause he got ninja tech
[1:19:24] <vaan_ratsbane> thancred is aether deficient from being in the lifestream
[1:19:25] <%demegodz> He's just standing there....menecingly!
[1:19:28] <$SleepyMaribo> look how slow its charging
[1:19:28] <%chimaera24> @AngriestPat they were outside the combat zone
[1:19:34] <VirtuallyCanadian> thancred is the yamcha of the group

[1:20:13] <%sshen> Just had a bunch of new people in ridorana lighthouse, contruct 7 fucked some shit up
[1:20:16] <vaan_ratsbane> we truly were the Old Man XIV
[1:20:21] <%Valdorick> Yeah Thancred, look at how dead he is, when Pat used 0 near death abilities.
[1:20:32] <Thalchampz> uh oh
[1:20:33] <+TheImmortal70> That's the exact reason
[1:20:35] <GarbageQueenEllie> ewww

[1:21:50] <GarbageQueenEllie> Holy shit
[1:22:01] <VirtuallyCanadian> @angriestpat vauthry in this scene is like when you tell a fat person the buffet is closed and its time to leave
[1:22:03] <Flickerember> Unlike Hawk and what's his name he literally ate the women
[1:22:03] <kvassimoto> LUL
[1:22:03] <%solomonpun> So its like a few steps off cannibalism.
[1:22:08] <CuriousReborn> I love how they all just watch him eat
[1:22:08] <%Valdorick> "What happened to the Light Warden?" "BITCH I ATE IT~"
[1:22:09] <+EmperorWeeb> did none of the citizens ever notice the baby face in vauthry's armpit?

[1:22:23] <%Jarvanii> I feel like many people probably suspected he was a warden from the start
[1:22:31] <Flickerember> Casual neck twist
[1:22:31] <%Tearonex> wow
[1:22:31] <+VashyronM> Did he just fucking 180 his goddamn head?
[1:22:32] <BunnyEmperor> He is actually the most beautiful man in the game
[1:22:33] <+Nanocomputer> @EmperorWeeb mIND-coNTROLLER
[1:22:33] <%TysonPG> The plot of Hat in Time but eviler
[1:22:44] <%Valdorick> I mean, he has a sineater growing out his tit, so yeah, its not a shock.

[1:25:35] <kvassimoto> Literal fat over heaven!
[1:25:39] <haisho> oh god it all makes sense now. Vauthry is Azys Lla!
[1:25:39] <$NitronStreams> nani the fuck is going on?
[1:25:40] <+SatsumaVA> @AngriestPat Angel poop dungeon
[1:25:40] <alrobot2014> looks like a fucking dungeon to me
[1:25:41] <Flickerember> Quest Shot
[1:25:42] <NotoriousMeep> 7 raiders from NotoriousMeep have joined! 
[1:25:43] <Graxe_> Vauthry Over Heaven
[1:25:44] <%brickwall35> Missed the last like 3 streams because Twitch never notified me 😭
[1:25:45] <sonofthedeepsouth> muh lips
[1:25:46] <BunnyEmperor> He became a floating rock
[1:25:50] <Graxe_> Or you know, Mt. Gulg from FF1
[1:25:51] <+Movemeister> Age of Ultron time
[1:25:53] <Thalchampz> OF COURSE
[1:25:57] <haisho> wait wait wait
[1:26:00] <Thalchampz> of course it's mount Gulg
[1:26:00] <sonofthedeepsouth> WHY
[1:26:01] <NotoriousMeep> hello nerds
[1:26:06] <Thalchampz> why wouldn't it be
[1:26:08] <haisho> Don't the DWARVES live in Mt Gulg?!
[1:26:10] <+DAIROCKETTO> wow i don't think any FF game has referenced mount gulg before
[1:26:18] <Flickerember> I dont get any references
[1:26:18] <%BestTeaMaker> what a pull
[1:26:23] <Sol_Install> we can't help them if we don't kill this fucker!
[1:26:26] <ClumzyDragon> but the people pat
[1:26:27] <Ozmodyas> Oh wow it’s literally Mt Gulg
[1:26:28] <sonofthedeepsouth> YOU SHOULD
[1:26:39] <%Diabetic> This is the worst decision
[1:26:40] <%Valdorick> He already ate people, what's a couple thousands more?
[1:26:47] <GarbageQueenEllie> I assumed killing the Fat Evil would cure everyone
[1:26:54] <bear_breaker20> no donate to your salvation army instead
[1:26:55] <Flickerember> One day I will play the other FFs
[1:26:59] <sonofthedeepsouth> You can solve inequality after we save the world alpha
[1:27:05] <%Kirby_Sauce> Theow em in the gulag
[1:27:06] <Flickerember> Doing ivalice raid nothing mattered to me
[1:27:12] <dickbuttwoman> We haven't killed the fat evil tho
[1:27:14] <Graxe_> FF9 had Mt. Gulg, but I think they translated it differently? It was even the volcano place.
[1:27:17] <%Kirby_Sauce> The darkness there will clean them out
[1:27:17] <dickbuttwoman> It merely flew off
[1:27:17] <BanSenpai> Think tbn is gonna get adjusted since it rarely breaks now?
[1:27:26] <+Katmon27> i have a question, are these guys recurring members in the story? or just for this expansion (i dont play ff14)
[1:27:37] <RetroDLC> Fair enough
[1:27:37] <+ItsYaGirlMaria> wow holy shit
[1:27:54] <%chimaera24> @Katmon27 they're recurring characters
[1:27:55] <Flickerember> recurring other than Ryne
[1:28:13] <+TheImmortal70> No, they see that anyone who can die of old age aren't actually Living
[1:28:19] <floatRand> I would certainly
[1:28:21] <+TheImmortal70> As in, they could kill millions and it means nothing
[1:28:23] <+Katmon27> ohh i see
[1:28:32] <%hussdogrob> wassup Shadowbras and Bros!
[1:28:33] <%Valdorick> Baseball will save 'em all

[1:28:40] <@Moobot> I've been playing this game for how long? Oh only 1h 28m.
[1:28:40] <GarbageQueenEllie> If there's a Scottish Harry Potter, then Cockney Star Wars can certainly be done

[1:28:46] <bear_breaker20> wow must be dope to have the mral highground when stabbing people ascians
[1:28:50] <Thalchampz> "my castle now, fat fuck"
[1:28:52] <%TG_Cid11> @AngriestPat this is the 80 hub zone
[1:28:55] <%KaizenChaos> Vader never said "Luke i'm your father"
[1:28:59] <%Kirby_Sauce> @GarbageQueenEllie wait, WHAT!?
[1:29:05] <$NitronStreams> now with 100% less fat evil
[1:29:18] <bestwaifuritsu> Access to the Strip Club has been granted
[1:29:20] <Flickerember> Now fat free
[1:29:26] <kvassimoto> whip out the champagne
[1:29:27] <%Valdorick> But also with 100% less hot jester ladies #Feelsbadman
[1:29:30] <%TG_Cid11> @AngriestPat have to finish MSQ to see any of the gear tho
[1:29:30] <Flickerember> Work the pole dammit
[1:29:32] <+EvilJester82> the fat, sweaty champagne
[1:29:34] <%Afterman_> but dying of old age is different than dying of re-merge? or are the ascians going to bring back ALL?
[1:29:50] <Flickerember> Nah ascians only bring homies back
[1:29:58] <GarbageQueenEllie> @Kirby_Sauce You can get it on Amazon, I think
[1:30:08] <haisho> isn't she blind?
[1:30:10] <kanodin> I don't wanna spoil anything but all these questions about the ascians will get answered.
[1:30:11] <%Afterman_> no no they gotta be bringing back everyone to be the heroes after all
[1:30:15] <Flickerember> She likes to watch
[1:30:15] <+Nanocomputer> @Afterman_ Doesn't matter cuz they dont see anyone as living things
[1:30:22] <Flickerember> Worm
[1:30:27] <%Afterman_> and nice
[1:30:30] <GarbageQueenEllie> She may be blind, but she can SMELL the dancing
[1:30:31] <%Valdorick> But she can SMELL 'em
[1:30:32] <Flickerember> Work the pole*
[1:30:35] <dredshift> She's watching their souls strip
[1:30:44] <Flickerember> Smell the twerk
[1:30:44] <bear_breaker20> so ascians are the bad guys right, cuase its some mental gymnastics to say otherwise so far methinks
[1:30:53] <Kiryu_RC> strip club in the game 10/10 will sub for 1 year minimum PogChamp
[1:30:58] <Flickerember> they baed more or less
[1:31:00] <%Afterman_> it's not mental at all once you know what emet has been saying lately
[1:31:15] <Flickerember> takes some splainin
[1:31:15] <%TG_Cid11> @bear_breaker20 yes they are
[1:31:27] <Flickerember> That looked like lodestone stucf
[1:31:40] <CrypticMochi> Just had a thought, are we going to fight the fat evil in that cool gold and white map?
[1:31:46] <%Afterman_> view pat a a living fragment of a broken jar. Would you really be mad at someone putting it back together?
[1:31:48] <dickbuttwoman> You hit up that lookout point in the tower yet?
[1:31:50] <Flickerember> My typing is bad sideways
[1:31:58] <%Valdorick> I will again say that the fucked thing about Emets plan is that, at least in Tactics Timeline, it 100% happens. Because at the end of the Ivalice timeline, Humans are the only sentient race, and magic is dead as fu~ck
[1:32:03] <+Blackmage9999> Big Kill la Kill sword on your back Pat
[1:32:04] <+sixcubit> @AngriestPat how was it physically possible for the Fat Evil to fit that entire lion inside him
[1:32:10] <vaan_ratsbane> fat evil sounds like he'd coward out like the big baby he is
[1:32:14] <+TheImmortal70> He's a sin eater too
[1:32:22] <+TheImmortal70> Assume anything he eats gets atomized
[1:32:27] <Flickerember> Cause fat evil
[1:32:32] <%solomonpun> Fat magic warps reality.
[1:32:34] <%Yadogari> Evil digestive juices
[1:32:35] <%hussdogrob> cause he chonk!
[1:32:35] <Flickerember> Void stomach
[1:32:38] <dickbuttwoman> Probably eating other sin eaters
[1:32:41] <%TG_Cid11> @AngriestPat you find out later
[1:32:45] <dredshift> Us regular not Fat Evil people have like 20 feet of intestines in us, he must have a mile of it
[1:32:45] <bear_breaker20> acid influx backfires into a bonus when your fat evil
[1:32:45] <Thalchampz> hey chat, if anyone was waiting for their key on the square store, i just got mine
[1:32:48] <alrobot2014> how does digesting a sin eater work
[1:32:48] <%Afterman_> his mother got turned into a sineater and he abosrbed her in the womb
[1:32:50] <%Afterman_> is my guess
[1:32:52] <Flickerember> Eat sin eaters to eat more sin eaters
[1:33:02] <bestwaifuritsu> Maybe Vauthry was the nipple face and the fat evil is the weird part.
[1:33:06] <Flickerember> Mmm I wont hint but mmm
[1:33:20] <Flickerember> Vauthry was the nipple face and wings
[1:33:21] <TioXyco> he's Queklain, that's how. (no, this is not a spoiler, this is a guess)
[1:33:29] <CrypticMochi> Is the nipple his twin?
[1:33:42] <%Afterman_> the nipple is his mother lmao
[1:33:52] <%solomonpun> So is the nier stuff part of the story or like a side part?
[1:33:55] <%demegodz> Muther
[1:33:56] <vaan_ratsbane> yes
[1:33:56] <%Afterman_> body horror abound this pack
[1:33:57] <dickbuttwoman> Body horror! yayyyyyyy!

[1:34:08] <%Fidel_Castbro> Yes
[1:34:09] <Jolnir> no
[1:34:10] <Flickerember> @angriestpat Much yes
[1:34:10] <haisho> I spoiled myself so yes
[1:34:11] <arkv01> nah man fat evil is born fat evil
[1:34:12] <%demegodz> Fat and Beyond
[1:34:14] <%ssks123> Yes
[1:34:15] <%Valdorick> My guess - BITCH HE ATE TH~EM
[1:34:18] <%Kyma1020> You will be told
[1:34:20] <+SlumberMan> Not even "Sorta", it's a solid yes
[1:34:27] <%TG_Cid11> yeah the fat part is unknown
[1:34:29] <%sirisvirus> yep
[1:34:29] <arkv01> beyond fat and evil?
[1:34:33] <Flickerember> @angriestpat through the power of plot blessing
[1:34:34] <%Kyma1020> It’s pretty wild
[1:34:38] <+cinder_chan> thank GOD
[1:34:39] <%hussdogrob> most nipples are twins at birth it's only the lucky ones who are born triplets
[1:34:41] <CrypticMochi> Cool, I hope he just instantly bloated
[1:34:43] <+lucaflow> It feels like they're not leaving any loose ends in this expansion @AngriestPat
[1:34:59] <%Afterman_> hyped as fuck to actually get my hands on this
[1:35:02] <haisho> but what about post-patch content?
[1:35:07] <BunnyEmperor> They do actually
[1:35:07] <dredshift> So I missed early stream, was there a boss fight with Zorn and Thorn?
[1:35:12] <%Maids4lyfe> yes
[1:35:15] <arkv01> man being the unwanted triplet must suck
[1:35:16] <haisho> they were jobbers
[1:35:17] <%TG_Cid11> no real loose end at the MSQ
[1:35:18] <%Valdorick> @hussdogrob wouldn't that mean triplets are really 9 babies?
[1:35:19] <%SlowLikeThunder> yeah I feel like the Black Rose shit is what we're gonna be mostly be dealing with in the patch cycle
[1:35:23] <Flickerember> Ok who is Zom and Thorn?
[1:35:26] <arkv01> while your other two triplets fuck each other and you're left out FeelsBadMan
[1:35:27] <SailingSaturn> This one is the most screwed up, the sick singer was turned cirPls
[1:35:37] <%Maids4lyfe> red and blue jobbers
[1:35:42] <GarbageQueenEllie> Baseball wants to help
[1:35:46] <arkv01> oh yeah what happened to clown titties?
[1:35:51] <dickbuttwoman> Is that even an option as a lalafell?
[1:35:55] <Flickerember> Like was that their actual names?
[1:35:59] <arkv01> do we get to employ clown titties for ourselves now?
[1:36:00] <+sixcubit> @hussdogrob if you're right (and that sounds about right tbh) then Triplets can't have nipples. if there's quadruplets, where does the fourth one come from
[1:36:02] <%Kirby_Sauce> Cheer500 I just figured it out. Pat really likes orks. He also has reality warping powers based on his perception of reality. But he's not an ork. He must be... DIGGANOBZ!
[1:36:02] <kanodin> they weren't given names
[1:36:04] <%Kirby_Sauce> reward A Cheer shared Rewards to 10 others in Chat!
[1:36:07] <%hussdogrob> @valdorick most people have two nipples thus one baby is a set of twin nipples
[1:36:15] <Flickerember> So it is a reference just dunno to wut
[1:36:22] <Thalchampz> oh that's right, her canon name is Baseball
[1:36:28] <%Maids4lyfe> a pair of bosses from earlier FF games
[1:36:31] <Jolnir> Why is her hair red now?
[1:36:34] <%Valdorick> In FF9, there are two jesters, Zorn and Thorn
[1:36:38] <%demegodz> nice Fat!
[1:36:38] <arkv01> baseball and madden
[1:36:43] <Flickerember> Cause she ate Minfillia
[1:36:47] <arkv01> she is APPROACHING fat evil
[1:36:47] <%hussdogrob> @sixcubit mind blown rn
[1:36:47] <dickbuttwoman> Big ol' kitty
[1:36:49] <%TG_Cid11> Phat Cat
[1:36:50] <Thalchampz> chunky cat lady
[1:36:52] <%Fidel_Castbro> Chonk
[1:36:56] <%demegodz> Plump Cat
[1:36:58] <%Maids4lyfe> @Jolnir because she absorbed Minfillia
[1:36:58] <arkv01> chonk evil
[1:36:58] <dredshift> It's the Fat Charity
[1:37:04] <%Valdorick> Big Puss lived, no RIP Big Puss
[1:37:05] <%SlowLikeThunder> She's just fat, she's not evil fat
[1:37:05] <%demegodz> Chunk Good
[1:37:06] <GarbageQueenEllie> He gonna lie
[1:37:09] <deswescappy> Damn whatba chonker
[1:37:12] <Jolnir> I want to absorb minfllia
[1:37:15] <%Kirby_Sauce> Now shobe his face in the fact that 1000 people just died cause he NEEDED to heal them
[1:37:15] <Flickerember> Shes fat good(?)
[1:37:21] <floatRand> One thing I don't get is that since Minfilias have been around Kholesia/Eulmore quite a bit, how come Minfilia never noticed that he was a sin eater? Or did she just know and uh
[1:37:22] <%SlowLikeThunder> you're not evil fat until you have more chins than nipples
[1:37:26] <%TG_Cid11> You are all shit and you should feel like shit
[1:37:26] <arkv01> @Jolnir you'll have to kill thancred first
[1:37:32] <Jolnir> he a bitch
[1:37:33] <CrypticMochi> She the good chungus
[1:37:33] <Flickerember> She didnt have shin power to see
[1:37:41] <%ssks123> She didnt have the ability to see them then
[1:37:45] <GarbageQueenEllie> Oh nvm
[1:37:56] <%Valdorick> "also, you are all 100% cannibals."
[1:37:57] <alrobot2014> and then they evejtually get it
[1:37:59] <%terminallyCapriciousz> Fat Evil x24
[1:38:01] <dredshift> And then they all go "Oh no, we knew"
[1:38:01] <%hussdogrob> @slowlikethunder then the lucky folks are the ones born with three nipples more room for chins
[1:38:03] <JoshTheFace> LUL
[1:38:05] <arkv01> that is a clinical definition, clean
[1:38:06] <Flickerember> With slow zoom in with fisheye
[1:38:11] <+DAIROCKETTO> what about kingpin
[1:38:13] <Flickerember> Fat. Evil.
[1:38:16] <$valriot> Chubby Mischief @angriestpat

[1:38:20] <arkv01> vauthrys sex puppets mmmm
[1:38:21] <Flickerember> Kingpin muscle
[1:38:22] <%ssks123> Thats a stat bonus
[1:38:26] <Graxe_> Vauthry had a face growing out of him. That makes him even more evil.
[1:38:30] <+sixcubit> @AngriestPat the more nipples you have the closer you are to becoming a holy saint as the chin/nipple ratio goes down
[1:38:39] <+Double_Tap_That> This is beyond Fat Evil. This is the Light Fat Evil
[1:38:39] <%SggtMarshie> More importantly, he's saying you've been eating people this whole time!
[1:38:39] <%TG_Cid11> tldr YOuu are all shitty people
[1:38:42] <Flickerember> Yall still were asshats tho
[1:38:44] <%Maids4lyfe> more nipples = more human
[1:38:49] <%demegodz> Rich Shaming

[1:46:10] <Supathief> Pat streaming FF14!? moon2H

[1:46:14] <%TG_Cid11> yea
[1:46:15] <$SGrim> @AngriestPat they were trapped underground long enough to forget all human culture, so they started worshipping orks and behaving like them,. It's great SMOrc
[1:46:21] <Flickerember> Kinda inconsequential at this point
[1:46:27] <+justianxix> How long until the next dungeon?
[1:46:29] <r_Foeburden87> the money is so small you don't notice
[1:46:38] <Supathief> Working for the past 9 days my guy.

[1:49:40] <bear_breaker20> wow pat just watched him killa dude
[1:49:42] <Retinolgaming> Do you know when the official release time is? Still cant get my registration code.
[1:49:53] <%TG_Cid11> its open now
[1:50:05] <kanodin> they're sending the codes out slowly, early access lasts until friday so you should get it well before then
[1:50:05] <%Kirby_Sauce> Cheer500 man, shopping at the sister location to the retail you work at is weird, hits that uncanny valley. Even weirder is that that was the one i used to live by, so it was vaguely nostalgic too. Place had shit wifi though, couldn't watch while I was in there
[1:50:07] <%Kirby_Sauce> reward A Cheer shared Rewards to 10 others in Chat!
[1:50:08] <Flickerember> I hope there is a sin eater somewhere named gracious and glorious
[1:50:08] <%ElenaManetta> he can infinity stone teleport
[1:50:10] <alrobot2014> Thanks for the PrideWingR @kirby_sauce
[1:50:15] <+TheImmortal70> They all do that
[1:50:19] <Retinolgaming> @kanodin Thanks!
[1:50:19] <Sol_Install> He's a light warden that can go into darkness huh?
[1:50:20] <+TheImmortal70> At the very beginning
[1:50:30] <KatabolicRage> the first sineater transformation you see is the most memorable really
[1:50:34] <KatabolicRage> it was gloriously horrific
[1:50:35] <%ElenaManetta> nah, if he has semi free will he can say KILL ME and now it's a blessing.
[1:50:37] <%Kirby_Sauce> Suffer not the mutant
[1:50:47] <%TG_Cid11> yea its never explained @Sol_Install
[1:51:17] <%SlowLikeThunder> Garrison is your grandson???
[1:51:20] <kanodin> they didn't want to make a new teleport animation
[1:51:24] <+Woronov> @AngriestPat pat u need to be lvl 80 to finish this questline
[1:51:44] <%Kirby_Sauce> Dude, imagine a race that spoke like groot, but their words were the universal "KILL ME, I'M EVIL"
[1:51:48] <bear_breaker20> how des fat evil keep doing it tho
[1:51:57] <Flickerember> feelsbadman get a little spoil about tank role quest
[1:52:13] <%Valdorick> Big and Strong Edge
[1:52:15] <AdmiralButtloaf> @AngriestPat if every sin eater is called Forgiven why not just call them The Forgiven?
[1:52:25] <+Woronov> ah damn u are right XD its not to lose out on exp
[1:52:28] <TioXyco> but the hat makes you -10 edgy
[1:52:29] <Flickerember> @angriestpat I bet he cant hear the buttrock while fighting
[1:52:33] <%ElenaManetta> tell him his wife was aware when you slew her
[1:52:40] <%Afterman_> he can have his wife back after they re-merge the world's
[1:52:43] <jackythefrost> I just beat the main story today holy shit the last area, dungeon and boss are completely insane
[1:52:56] <%TG_Cid11> yea its great
[1:53:07] <@Moobot> Whoa I don't even shout that much! (@SlowLikeThunder) (warning)
[1:53:19] <bear_breaker20> wouldnt that re merge stuff also bring back fat evil tho
[1:53:24] <ZaDoorman> @jackythefrost I also just finished it, its nuts!
[1:53:30] <%SlowLikeThunder> paladin @AngriestPat
[1:53:51] <+TheImmortal70> Not really
[1:53:57] <%terminallyCapriciousz> tank queues are jacked rn
[1:53:58] <%Drarrk> Drarrk subscribed with Twitch Prime. 
[1:54:12] <jackythefrost> @SlowLikeThunder Queue for the last boss is trash for everyone, you NEED to use PF for it
[1:54:14] <+TheImmortal70> The remerge kills everyone from every version other than the source, and the people on the source get hit by natural disasters which can kill them
[1:54:29] <+TheImmortal70> And then whoever survives to the end is now like the old Ascians again assumedly
[1:54:32] <absolute_cagemony> is FF14 effected by the massive internet outage issues?
[1:54:35] <floatRand> I don't know why it is so trash
[1:54:35] <Jolnir> all qs are jacked right now
[1:55:08] <Thalchampz> a'ight
[1:55:10] <%ssks123> Dps are actually in need every once in awhile its fucked
[1:55:12] <absolute_cagemony> Time for a big pee
[1:55:16] <%Dwarven_Gaming> annnd queue 10 minutes of pain
[1:55:17] <%SlowLikeThunder> this is the first time I've actually been caught up in content so I'm not really used to queues where you don't have like a million people as options doping it in their roulettes
[1:55:25] <bear_breaker20> So a survival of the fittest creation myth or a self fullfilling prophecy sounds like
[1:55:34] <jackythefrost> Also the post game dungeon is great, it's one big call back
[1:55:37] <+TheImmortal70> Oh it's true
[1:55:44] <+TheImmortal70> It's the absolute truth, it's just fucked up
[1:56:21] <bear_breaker20> idk thats just what the ascians what everyone to think
[1:56:23] <+TheImmortal70> But in my mind there are so many calamities that are going to happen that the number of people still alive is going to be near enough to 0 to not make it worth it
[1:56:23] <floatRand> Both were great.
[1:56:27] <floatRand> But the other especially so
[1:56:34] <floatRand> Probably my favourite dungeon
[1:56:34] <ZaDoorman> and I'm seriously thinking about sticking with the SAM AF throughout the entirety of this expansion.
[1:57:05] <floatRand> I kinda feel like forcing myself going through alliance roulette with SCH
[1:57:10] <%JGardner88> Big oof when Pat is like 1 or 2 msq's behind me
[1:57:19] <floatRand> But headache and losing energy drain HURTS
[1:57:22] <ClumzyDragon> wb
[1:57:23] <Thalchampz> shhhhhh
[1:57:26] <ClumzyDragon> nice work
[1:57:26] <+TripleHelix> D:
[1:57:27] <BunnyEmperor> With dirty hands? DansGame
[1:57:28] <%ElenaManetta> i THOUGHT you were going to say ORgans
[1:57:29] <vaan_ratsbane> nice moves joker
[1:57:33] <%Valdorick> Clip this, and tweet it to Paige Kappa
[1:57:36] <%Dr00_PhD> brb snitchin
[1:57:41] <%TaifuDragon> @peachsaliva snitchin
[1:57:41] <absolute_cagemony> Pat and his giant dong return for more adventure!
[1:57:43] <kvassimoto> Shhhhh
[1:57:44] <TsundereFFXIV> everybody tweet Paige right NOW
[1:57:48] <ZaDoorman> I'm just wondering what you get for finishing all the role quests
[1:57:49] <Kongro_> she never saw it coming
[1:57:49] <%ElenaManetta> The product placement on these streams is amazing
[1:57:51] <%ElenaManetta> i actually want oreos
[1:57:52] <TsundereFFXIV> snitch on Pat
[1:57:59] <%raios22> itmejpMAD
[1:58:11] <BunnyEmperor> So the Oreos were hidden on the toilet then?
[1:58:12] <bear_breaker20> pat gets royalties off skeletons*
[1:58:19] <%JGardner88> Damn Pat your going into Role Quests I havent touched yet
[1:58:30] <absolute_cagemony> Tweet Paige that Pat stole two of her magnum condoms, she'll come running
[1:58:39] <CrypticMochi> Never tried thin oreos. Are those any good?
[1:58:57] <%SlowLikeThunder> I'm in, time to wipe 7 times and then dissolve the poarty and my soul
[1:58:58] <%Dr00_PhD> They're better
[1:59:00] <%Maids4lyfe> no they're not
[1:59:01] <%ElenaManetta> They have less middle stuffing
[1:59:05] <%Maids4lyfe> thin oreos are thin
[1:59:09] <ZaDoorman> @jgardner88 you should REALY keep up with role quests, it's pretty important later on in the story.
[1:59:20] <%Maids4lyfe> they're not regular oreos DansGame
[1:59:29] <$valriot> thin oreos are better to snacc in my opinion
[1:59:30] <%ElenaManetta> i love this music
[1:59:36] <%ElenaManetta> with this big goofy mushroom place
[1:59:37] <CrypticMochi> Yeah, but size does make a texture difference
[1:59:37] <jackythefrost> Final boss is better than Thordan imo
[1:59:52] <@Velyndra> @AngriestPat story done. Fuck the Lochs. Fuck Ala Mhigo. Fuck Shinryu. and Fuck Stormblood.
[1:59:54] <+Williamld> You definitely haven't seen thin oreos
[1:59:55] <%Maids4lyfe> no that's because the BRAND is the original
[2:00:00] <BunnyEmperor> Paige took the real ones out of the box and replaced them with those made of sawdust
[2:00:05] <arkv01> thats a bold claim
[2:00:06] <@DariusFTL> Can confirm final boss is better than Thordan
[2:00:08] <%theturtlebar> Betterthan Thordan
[2:00:12] <GDandy_> Confirming
[2:00:13] <$valriot> I'd say they're on par
[2:00:18] <wheeely> I can't wait for the extreme trial
[2:00:22] <%ElenaManetta> Is that the one million leaves crafter
[2:00:27] <%BlueMoonBlues> pretty much
[2:00:32] <$valriot> But the entire ending is overall better than HW
[2:00:34] <BunnyEmperor> Shinryu was great I dont understand
[2:00:36] <ZaDoorman> @angriestpat seriously, the last part of this game is FUCKING GREAT!!!
[2:00:40] <%Afterman_> so he's saying emet is goat
[2:00:51] <HelixPixel> This fucking game has no fucking right to be this good
[2:00:53] <@Velyndra> i am the crazy man
[2:00:55] <@Velyndra> hello
[2:00:58] <vaan_ratsbane> look at this dood
[2:00:59] <wheeely> where's THICKEMAN
[2:01:00] <%demegodz> LUL
[2:01:01] <%Afterman_> is emet goat
[2:01:02] <%ElenaManetta> all for AN ACHIEVEMENT
[2:01:02] <+Double_Tap_That> What You Doing Lad
[2:01:13] <%Fidel_Castbro> You’ve seen Wyd Lad
[2:01:19] <ZaDoorman> @helixpixel praise be unto Yoshi-P and team
[2:01:21] <%Fidel_Castbro> But have you seen Thickeman
[2:01:28] <%terminallyCapriciousz> It's nearly 5 pm on the day of release and I ***STILL*** do not have my code for shadowbringers. Ree
[2:01:33] <@Velyndra> @AngriestPat Mario will help you
[2:01:41] <$valriot> WHAT ABOUT COG @angriestpat
[2:01:45] <%Mekhet09> Pat I like these streams but I would suggest you hold on doing them so often man.
[2:01:45] <vaan_ratsbane> your gulp sounded like fat evil eating moel
[2:01:56] <+bOPTR> is that an armadilo
[2:02:10] <%TG_Cid11> @AngriestPat are you going to start Titania EX tomorrow?
[2:02:14] <Jolnir> LUL
[2:02:17] <vaan_ratsbane> it's a Nu Mou, from the Ivalice games
[2:03:00] <%Valdorick> All I remember about Nu Mou is their classes being awful in Tactics Advance.
[2:03:13] <%TG_Cid11> oh i didnt know you were leaving
[2:03:18] <%Afterman_> shit hyped
[2:03:22] <absolute_cagemony> RTX!
[2:03:23] <vaan_ratsbane> the 2 ex dungeons are great, one of them bloody fantastic if you've kept up with the game's optional content
[2:03:46] <%TheSniperJoe> HeyGuys500 Without giving BIIIIG spoilers, what do you think about Mini-filia over Minfilia? I feel like she's a hard upgrade but people's responses seem to have varied wildly. I mean, no one can be as great as Moenbryda...but I digress.
[2:03:48] <%TheSniperJoe> reward A Cheer shared Rewards to 10 others in Chat!
[2:03:52] <%theturtlebar> He means 8man raids
[2:03:54] <jackythefrost> The reason why is a spoiler
[2:03:55] <+ItsYaGirlMaria> i wouldnt say more
[2:03:55] <%Gogogolem> shut up no spoilers
[2:04:00] <+ItsYaGirlMaria> stop spoiling
[2:04:05] <ZaDoorman> man, I wonder what 5.0 Hidebrand quests will be like.
[2:04:08] <vaan_ratsbane> Yoshi said they developed shadowbringers expecting players to have done all stuff beforehand, so they're going all out
[2:04:15] <%Dwarven_Gaming> guys shuddup
[2:05:13] <Jolnir> america one the futbol
[2:05:16] <Jolnir> won*
[2:05:23] <%Afterman_> is Branden pat of this world
[2:05:31] <vaan_ratsbane> dass a football
[2:05:34] <%Afterman_> he was a big man too
[2:06:22] <bestwaifuritsu> Tell him what you really think. How you love macrofilia more LUL
[2:06:26] <dickbuttwoman> I'm still very much done with "I mustn't runaway" characters tho
[2:06:29] <+TheImmortal70> Lore wise no, but it’s a cool fan canon to say whatever race you are is the equal to the warrior of darkness of that race
[2:06:47] <vaan_ratsbane> the truest answer is wind-up minfilia is the best
[2:07:08] <jackythefrost> It's not hard to be better than original Minfilia, you just have to do something relevant to the plot without just being a glorified plot device
[2:07:21] <floatRand> Meanwhile I am running Void Ark as SCH. I haven't had to cast a single healing spell or ability
[2:07:33] <floatRand> With 3 dancers
[2:07:41] <floatRand> And other healer disconnected
[2:07:50] <%Mekhet09> I'm 6 million from 80 this is the worst. I either have to do alliance or story.
[2:08:04] <+TheImmortal70> The dancers better be sharing with each other only
[2:08:09] <+bOPTR> Is Sul an armadillo
[2:08:12] <+TheImmortal70> Just do msq
[2:08:40] <%Mekhet09> I wouldn't be doing this if I could do msq.
[2:09:12] <%Afterman_> mmm
[2:09:34] <%Fatmanjoggin> do hunts
[2:09:50] <%Fatmanjoggin> Should give around that much xp
[2:10:28] <%terminallyCapriciousz> MSQ roulette will bump you over, Mekhet
[2:10:29] <Aristotlay> It’s the last thing I think about before I go to bed at night. It’s the first thing I think about when I wake up in the morning: REVENGE!
[2:11:01] <%Mekhet09> It's also 30 minutes of cutscenes.
[2:11:18] <+PunishedMercer_> the first thing i think of when i wake up is my hunger.
[2:11:25] <%Fidel_Castbro> MSQ is always worth it when it comes to leveling
[2:11:26] <+PunishedMercer_> for revenge.
[2:11:26] <%Mekhet09> Leveling only gives like 3m compared to MSQ.
[2:11:28] <+TheImmortal70> That’s praetorium and that would guarantee the level
[2:11:50] <%Mekhet09> I'd rather do alliance.
[2:11:54] <+TheImmortal70> And castrum is only 20
[2:12:01] <+TheImmortal70> Then do alliance
[2:13:29] <%SlowLikeThunder> ayyyy I beat the video game
[2:13:40] <alrobot2014> grats
[2:13:52] <%sshen> Pat, do you think they should make the construct 7 mechanics main story so they can truly sort the bads?
[2:13:55] <%SlowLikeThunder> it was pretttty good
[2:14:05] <sonnyneos> Is that a potato or Vivi
[2:14:08] <%Fatmanjoggin> look at how evil this guy is
[2:14:15] <+TheImmortal70> Potato with vivi eyes
[2:14:16] <%Fatmanjoggin> I thought I could trust you SATAN
[2:14:17] <%Mekhet09> Why do they always look evil.
[2:14:20] <%Fidel_Castbro> It’s a dwarf
[2:14:23] <Aristotlay> That potato sure looks like a potato

[2:14:25] <%CaptainPileDriver> pat, you saying driving is for suckers use your feet from the man who has gout is fucking funny
[2:14:43] <sonnyneos> Damn NotLikeThis
[2:15:02] <+PunishedMercer_> he just said get rekt, kids.
[2:15:08] <+PunishedMercer_> i can't believe it.
[2:15:21] <%Valdorick> He has that Hat, and that Statch, and no one said "No, you're not allowed any position of power."!?
[2:15:25] <alrobot2014> oh this music i loves it
[2:15:29] <+justianxix> cute
[2:15:31] <Thalchampz> Yeyeye
[2:15:38] <ClumzyDragon> YES
[2:15:42] <Forester_Skippy> i hope pat rmeembers how to play paladin
[2:15:51] <%Valdorick> Do combo
[2:16:05] <%Mekhet09> You have to do more than just one button pat.
[2:16:06] <Thalchampz> tbh paladin ain't that hard, especially after 5.0
[2:16:21] <%CaptainPileDriver> are you playing a dark knight? idk i've never played this game before
[2:16:23] <Thalchampz> as it should
[2:16:30] <Jolnir> music you probably havent heard for a while tbf
[2:16:34] <%CaptainPileDriver> or is this a knight?/warrior?
[2:16:37] <couch_potato_Ed_Boy> Isn't this song in Zodiac Age as well?
[2:16:39] <%Valdorick> "Heroes, I've conjured a blizzard, the enemy into it!"
[2:16:39] <VirtuallyCanadian> he is @captainpiledriver
[2:16:43] <%CaptainPileDriver> sweet
[2:16:52] <%CaptainPileDriver> dark knights are always the coolest
[2:16:54] <kanodin> he's temporarily playing a paladin for this specific quest
[2:17:01] <%CaptainPileDriver> oookay
[2:17:02] <VirtuallyCanadian> currently at this moment hes a paladin
[2:17:16] <floatRand> It is more that he is a specific lore character doing a thing
[2:17:31] <floatRand> FFXIV started recently doing these sort of things
[2:17:36] <floatRand> ...things.
[2:17:45] <%CaptainPileDriver> hm, okay that's cool
[2:17:57] <%Afterman_> they have... different names
[2:18:15] <Thalchampz> stack you nerds!
[2:18:18] <+PunishedMercer_> it's like WoW scenarios, except good.
[2:18:31] <%Valdorick> ^
[2:18:44] <%CaptainPileDriver> idk, i've never played any mmo
[2:18:49] <%Afterman_> oh fuuuuck my mind.

[2:19:23] <Jolnir> wtf doood
[2:19:33] <%Afterman_> am I the only one who noticed?
[2:19:34] <VirtuallyCanadian> do you like ff lore? @captainpiledriver then this game is for you
[2:19:36] <+PunishedMercer_> y'shtola is y'shtola
[2:19:36] <vaan_ratsbane> you hear that? it's the sound of enochians being dropped
[2:19:39] <%BlueMoonBlues> @Afterman_ the WoD's used fake names when they went to the source
[2:19:40] <AdmiralButtloaf> @AngriestPat this asshole has Adkiragh's character model
[2:19:41] <%Kyma1020> But Pat. I need more power
[2:19:46] <%Afterman_> aaah ok
[2:19:49] <+lucaflow> Wait I missed it what the heck is happening now?
[2:19:50] <%BlueMoonBlues> according to the lorebook
[2:20:04] <EdHeng> look at Pat
[2:20:06] <%Afterman_> @bluemoonblues i was thinking maybe these were different versions if them.
[2:20:08] <%Valdorick> "I'm dropping an AoE over here, Tank, pull the mobs for me"
[2:20:08] <EdHeng> his happy face
[2:20:15] <%Afterman_> of*

[2:20:44] <bestwaifuritsu> D'aww Arbert defending the loin lusting lalafells honor
[2:20:48] <%rumtumtugnutz> destrucity?
[2:20:51] <%BlueMoonBlues> @Afterman_ i thought that too when first playing, i had to go back and check lol
[2:20:57] <BunnyEmperor> Job training reminder
[2:21:05] <%Afterman_> would've blew my mind lol
[2:21:09] <Forester_Skippy> its like advanced hall of novice
[2:21:18] <KatabolicRage> you would be amazed the amount of people who will be level 70+ and not know this shit
[2:21:19] <%RittiFruity> They properly teach you how to play the role before finishing the story
[2:21:21] <floatRand> After people wanted to get so 'Hall of Intermediate', they implemented it in another form. The madmen.
[2:21:29] <Thalchampz> hall of git Gud
[2:21:43] <BunnyEmperor> monkaS enrage
[2:21:53] <%CaptainPileDriver> hm, so i should pick up shadowbringers on ps4 since i don't have a pc then is what i'm getting at
[2:21:56] <%Kyma1020> Forces those who use jump potions to learn their job
[2:22:16] <%Kyma1020> You should it’s a great game
[2:22:21] <%Kirijuo> The Caster one forces you to adjust through a ton of aoe's LUL
[2:22:21] <Thalchampz> you can try the trial version, check the game play and whatnot
[2:22:33] <%CaptainPileDriver> awesome
[2:22:42] <%CaptainPileDriver> guess i'll go download that trial

[2:25:20] <%Valdorick> Isn't that the one that killed the Medic and Jobber?
[2:25:29] <Retinolgaming> Her persona is loose
[2:25:33] <+Movemeister> Subliminal messages?
[2:25:34] <kanodin> tadric made a sineater decades early
[2:25:43] <AdmiralButtloaf> the boss from St. Macaronni's Arbor Day
[2:25:45] <$Yakobro> naroSad
[2:25:47] <%TaifuDragon> Why would you kill her, she only just got hot
[2:25:48] <+PunishedMercer_> that face
[2:25:52] <absolute_cagemony> stabbing solves all problems prematurely
[2:25:54] <BunnyEmperor> sad roe

[2:26:15] <Thalchampz> LUL
[2:26:17] <+PunishedMercer_> D:
[2:26:40] <%Valdorick> Why did he look at that freako corpse and then mourn like he knew exactly why it was?
[2:26:42] <%Valdorick> who*
[2:26:46] <%demegodz> Rock Waifu

[2:27:01] <%Fatmanjoggin> this ROCK is my WAIFU
[2:27:02] <alrobot2014> magicite from ff6?
[2:27:04] <TurtlesAndTentacles> I'm confused why did she transform
[2:27:07] <Thalchampz> wait so who do you play as on the melee dps role quests? there is no one on their group with that role
[2:27:11] <BunnyEmperor> MY TREASURE
[2:27:15] <TheHotStuven> so he''s a belmont?
[2:27:17] <ClumzyDragon> rock chan
[2:27:17] <GarbageQueenEllie> Aww poor Largeman
[2:27:23] <%VantomPayne> dps all get Renda, the bard
[2:27:24] <kanodin> the evil wizard was using magic to transform people
[2:27:32] <@Moobot> I don't know if I can trust that. (@floatRand) (warning)
[2:27:33] <%VantomPayne> well, physical
[2:27:34] <snowmanse> @TurtlesAndTentacles A wizard did it
[2:27:36] <dredshift> Aren't those dudes the ones from ARR's opening movie?
[2:27:39] <$Yakobro> @Thalchampz I think it's phys dps, caster dps healer tank, so phys would be the bard?
[2:27:40] <+TheImmortal70> @thalchampz The bard since it’s physical
[2:27:40] <TurtlesAndTentacles> thank you!
[2:27:43] <ashuckel> yo that's a cool sword
[2:27:49] <Thalchampz> makes sense
[2:28:07] <Thalchampz> it's super complicated
[2:28:07] <%VantomPayne> Yes But Actually No
[2:28:08] <%Valdorick> Yes but not
[2:28:12] <floatRand> Thanks moobot. As I said, it is physical dps, magic dps, healer and tank
[2:28:26] <%madogod> no but not yes
[2:28:49] <GarbageQueenEllie> You know what makes me feel better when I'm sad? The Gold Saucer!
[2:29:10] <+PunishedMercer_> for her granson
[2:29:27] <+TheImmortal70> The movies exist in an alternate timeline where they are the main characters and ardbert survived somehow
[2:29:27] <AdmiralButtloaf> The characters in the opening cutscenes aren't canon characters. They are representations of the players. The Warrior/Monk?Samurai/Dragoon dude is the fill in for you the player
[2:29:39] <%madogod> did Pat not pick up any good armour piece? he's been wearing the same thing since the update.
[2:29:42] <MSN04_Sazabi> Revenge feels super good kids, always go for revenge
[2:29:43] <floatRand> Complimentary food reward
[2:29:52] <BunnyEmperor> But I need more Souls... the sword demands it
[2:30:05] <floatRand> Surrender them!
[2:30:13] <%rumtumtugnutz> @madogod he's picked up a lot, but he glams it
[2:30:15] <+TheImmortal70> It’s a glamor
[2:30:18] <AdmiralButtloaf> no
[2:30:22] <TsundereFFXIV> just keep going
[2:30:22] <+probablynotadam> Grind
[2:30:22] <@Velyndra> @AngriestPat keep going
[2:30:22] <floatRand> If you are asking about level gate, doesn't come for quite a while.
[2:30:22] <AdmiralButtloaf> your good
[2:30:23] <kanodin> just doing the main story quest will get you to 80
[2:30:24] <%Fatmanjoggin> Yeah you will be fine
[2:30:24] <+wunp_fxs> youll be fine
[2:30:25] <ahobo77> your good
[2:30:26] <Kongro_> You will be good
[2:30:26] <%Misum> you could honestly skip every sidequest and STILL be the right level
[2:30:26] <jackythefrost> No need to grind
[2:30:27] <%terminallyCapriciousz> Just keep going
[2:30:28] <%BlueMoonBlues> totally good
[2:30:28] <+Williamld> Do not grind
[2:30:28] <DeathGodSkeith> 79 dungeon will top you off
[2:30:28] <Fronzadelic> Is it too late to get started with this game?
[2:30:28] <%Misum> yr so far ahead
[2:30:29] <Jfrooz> you will be fine
[2:30:29] <KatabolicRage> you should be ok
[2:30:30] <+Truthmoon> you’re fine Pat
[2:30:31] <+TheImmortal70> You’re a whole zone off the last zone
[2:30:32] <oceanmatt> you prob fine
[2:30:33] <$valriot> NO JUST BLAST MSQ
[2:30:35] <JoshTheFace> your good
[2:30:35] <%Cn_alpha_02> You will be good.
[2:30:36] <Kongro_> You have a shit ton of quests left
[2:30:36] <BunnyEmperor> Might be close
[2:30:37] <%korth367> do your roulettes at the least if you havent
[2:30:37] <ricotez> will be fine
[2:30:38] <%MoraMiarty> you wont be finebased on my experience
[2:30:40] <%Mekhet09> You might be fine not sure though.
[2:30:40] <+Truthmoon> blast that msq boi
[2:30:41] <+ItsYaGirlMaria> you miiight need to do some extra things but youre probably good
[2:30:42] <+datmegamandeeeee> MSQ till last dungo
[2:30:46] <%Misum> i was freshly dinged 78 at this point
[2:30:50] <+probablynotadam> Oh right, I guess if you rested exp the 79 dungeon will help more than it did for me
[2:30:51] <MonstarGrrrl> go grind on clemps :)
[2:30:55] <%tsubaki_atsuki> tsubaki_atsuki subscribed with Twitch Prime. They've subscribed for 3 months! 
[2:30:58] <ricotez> by the time you hit the wall you'll probably be 80 already
[2:30:58] <%Honaoko> have you done your challenge log already?
[2:31:03] <BunnyEmperor> But MSQ should carry until you get to the part where you need 80 considering the place it is
[2:31:04] <kanodin> I was level 77 at this point you'll make it easily
[2:31:09] <+ItsYaGirlMaria> worst case you might have to do like a trial or raid roulette
[2:31:12] <+ItsYaGirlMaria> or that
[2:31:19] <%Kirijuo> I was at the same exp when I did these quests, if anything you'll only be like 2-5 mil off, which is 1 trail roulette
[2:31:24] <%Fatmanjoggin> It's also super cool
[2:31:27] <$valriot> @angriestpat Fun fact, you actually get very little exp from MSQ from here onwards so you actually did it good
[2:31:28] <sousuke21> you get so much xp just from the dungeons anyways
[2:31:48] <BunnyEmperor> LUL
[2:31:52] <%Valdorick> What does that even MEAN!?
[2:32:11] <+PunishedMercer_> dry docking sounds painful
[2:32:48] <Sol_Install> Judge Eye
[2:33:09] <%MoraMiarty> why nonjudgement
[2:33:27] <$SleepyMaribo> i swear MSQ dungeons do a terrible job of gearing you this Expansion... ive yet ot get a single Tank piece and im at the 75 dungeon
[2:33:28] <MSN04_Sazabi> Because Pat wants you to buy Judgment instead
[2:33:43] <%MoraMiarty> I dont have a ps4
[2:33:53] <koolaid_kevster> is woolie streaming judgment?
[2:33:58] <sousuke21> they have been throwing gear at me left and right
[2:33:59] <$SleepyMaribo> i havent gotten anything from dungeons
[2:34:07] <BunnyEmperor> @SleepyMaribo you will get free gear at 80
[2:34:12] <BlueLunecy> Don't you get a free piece of gear whenever you clear a dungeon
[2:34:12] <+Williamld> That's literally impossible
[2:34:17] <kanodin> it gives you a piece of armor for your class at the end of each dungeon
[2:34:22] <Flickerember> You should get guranteed gear from finishing it
[2:34:30] <%Afterman_> judgment is a great game
[2:34:30] <%Fatmanjoggin> probably just got jewelry
[2:34:30] <$SleepyMaribo> no it doesnt
[2:34:30] <Flickerember> Tied to current gear at least
[2:34:31] <kylejefferies> what does MSQ mean?
[2:34:32] <%MoraMiarty> have they said whether or not judgementt will be coming to pc?
[2:34:35] <Jolnir> false
[2:34:35] <BlueLunecy> Yes it does
[2:34:35] <Flickerember> er class/role
[2:34:35] <sousuke21> yes it does
[2:34:38] <%VantomPayne> it goes straight into your bag so many players would miss it
[2:34:40] <+probablynotadam> @SleepyMaribo it literally doe
[2:34:41] <+probablynotadam> does
[2:34:43] <+Williamld> Yes it does, you blithering idiot
[2:34:43] <$SleepyMaribo> i just finished the 75 one, and the gear was MCH stuff
[2:34:44] <ahobo77> it dose
[2:34:48] <%TaifuDragon> It totally does
[2:34:49] <BlueLunecy> Not the chest
[2:34:51] <vaan_ratsbane> it's been doing that since heavensward
[2:34:52] <%MoraMiarty> Ill buy it then if it does
[2:34:55] <arkv01> I'm starting to feel like they should've called this expansion Shadowbangers
[2:34:55] <+rangriz> it does
[2:34:57] <DeathGodSkeith> @SleepyMaribo yes it does dude dont talk if you dont know wats going on
[2:34:59] <+Gruntini> @kylejefferies Main Story Quest
[2:35:01] <$Big_Dream> yes
[2:35:02] <+ItsYaGirlMaria> is your inventory full
[2:35:03] <BlueLunecy> It just shoves into your bag
[2:35:05] <+pittbulldogg> it gave him armor but that stupid baby gremlin threw it on the ground
[2:35:07] <AdmiralButtloaf> guaranteed loot
[2:35:07] <%terminallyCapriciousz> YES sleepy, you get one piece at the end of every dungeon for FREE as well as the chest
[2:35:11] <%Kyderz3> lol
[2:35:13] <kylejefferies> thanks @gruntini
[2:35:17] <snowmanse> or armory chest if you have it set up that way
[2:35:22] <$SleepyMaribo> i didnt know i got free stuff, geez
[2:35:45] <%Fatmanjoggin> Is your stuff set up for items to be put directly into your armory?
[2:35:49] <%terminallyCapriciousz> don't apologize sleepy, don't pull a pat
[2:35:55] <vaan_ratsbane> that or you already have every single piece of the dungeon and you cant have duplicates
[2:35:59] <$Yakobro> pat you're always certain and wrong
[2:36:02] <KatabolicRage> there is exceptions to that rule, cap dungeons don't do it
[2:36:07] <$SleepyMaribo> I gotmy certainty in being wrong from you Pat
[2:36:13] <BunnyEmperor> The boat Pat
[2:36:13] <VirtuallyCanadian> how do you untoggle that @fatmanjoggin
[2:36:20] <+pittbulldogg> its pat's fault
[2:36:31] <%demegodz> Pat Fault i suppose
[2:36:43] <BunnyEmperor> You can yolo this
[2:36:46] <$Yakobro> LUL

[2:36:57] <Flickerember> Pats Gospel : Cool stuff is cool

[2:40:21] <%Valdorick> Ah yes, the CK2 issue. Which duke/count to have executed so you can steal their land.

[2:40:56] <BlueLunecy> You sieged the city, took out their leaders, and overturned their way of life
[2:40:57] <%SggtMarshie> You overthrew their leader, benevolently or not.
[2:41:14] <%Afterman_> but they aren't
[2:41:17] <bestwaifuritsu> Aww no bully Emmy
[2:41:18] <BlueLunecy> He's been over this, you aren't people so it isn't murder

[2:41:18] <BunnyEmperor> bo bo bo
[2:41:19] <%Maids4lyfe> It's not murder if you don't think they're people!
[2:41:23] <%Fenrirlives> remember Pat, it's not murder if you're not a person!
[2:41:24] <$valriot> @angriestpat Aren't you murderers technically?
[2:41:33] <powerprotoman> pat look out hes hitting on you

[2:41:55] <Flickerember> This honorable Nazi

[2:43:22] <%Fidel_Castbro> We was Ascians
[2:43:23] <%demegodz> NO

[2:43:26] <GarbageQueenEllie> YES
[2:43:29] <+Lost_Zombie> Everyone got sundered Pat lol

[2:47:00] <BunnyEmperor> Ugh fine... but don't laugh when I noclip through the floor
[2:47:01] <SailingSaturn> Those npc's behind him thought he was chosen LUL
[2:47:02] <snowmanse> People behind arbert thought you were waving at them
[2:47:04] <%Valdorick> You're Solus' child.
[2:47:07] <Flickerember> Hes.looking at me
[2:47:08] <Sol_Install> NPC thought he was choosen LUL
[2:47:10] <%snow_bush> BECOME AS GODS
[2:47:12] <Thalchampz> big tank bros
[2:47:15] <Sol_Install> chosen*
[2:47:18] <Flickerember> He is looking at me! Nah he aint.
[2:47:19] <vaan_ratsbane> elezen grow much slower so it's the other way around, it's weird
[2:47:21] <%Maids4lyfe> lol
[2:47:25] <+FOREVERCraig> Penis stomping is the most bourgeoisie
[2:47:25] <GarbageQueenEllie> How those elf twins get so smol? Did they Mike TV themselves?
[2:47:31] <BunnyEmperor> Oh yeah this part
[2:47:36] <bestwaifuritsu> @GarbageQueenEllie theyre half lalafell
[2:47:37] <+TheImmortal70> They were born tiny
[2:47:38] <%Maids4lyfe> the elf twins were always small
[2:47:44] <dredshift> This some Nier-ass music
[2:47:48] <BunnyEmperor> The part where this music plays the entire time until you complete this step of the quest LUL
[2:47:49] <alrobot2014> this some endgame sounding music
[2:47:53] <Flickerember> 2b ass music
[2:47:56] <GarbageQueenEllie> @bestwaifuritsu ...That's actually adorable.
[2:48:01] <%Valdorick> The kinda shit you'd hear in a final dungeon.
[2:48:25] <DarkCloud79> Shoebill time
[2:48:25] <dredshift> Hit the trigger for the vocals to come in
[2:48:42] <HeavyC4> Shadowbringers motif is godlike
[2:48:48] <%Fidel_Castbro> I’m not the only one who hears the transformers sound in this field theme right
[2:49:04] <Nillard> I totally hear it too
[2:49:09] <BunnyEmperor> Pat not spotting the shoebill :(
[2:49:11] <DarkCloud79> Missed the shoebill XD
[2:49:13] <Thalchampz> man that sword is SO COOL THO
[2:49:13] <arkv01> sokens really done a banger this expansion
[2:49:17] <Flickerember> So I normally use War for tank and Ast for heals. With Monk done should spam the tank or the heals
[2:49:18] <arkv01> who did the osts for ff11?
[2:49:28] <%TaifuDragon> SHOOBIL
[2:49:31] <%TaifuDragon> BEST
[2:49:33] <%MoraMiarty> you get funny dialogue
[2:49:36] <bestwaifuritsu> shoebills are cute. CUTE. best friend.
[2:49:43] <BunnyEmperor> Because it has important extra text LUL
[2:49:47] <Rentixx> oh yeah, doesn't 2b appear in this story? Or is that a side event?
[2:49:49] <%terminallyCapriciousz> @Flickerember Healer, tank queues are borked because of gunbreaker atm
[2:49:56] <%terminallyCapriciousz> @Rentixx side event, later
[2:50:04] <Thalchampz> @Rentixx that will come in a few months, a later update
[2:50:10] <Rentixx> ohh ok
[2:50:11] <%Valdorick> The bloodlust of this man
[2:50:12] <HeavyC4> that sword is so fucking stupid tho
[2:50:14] <arkv01> a non ff collab would seem like a side thing yeah
[2:50:15] <Flickerember> @terminallycapriciousz I shall do that tanks for the tip
[2:50:15] <+SlumberMan> I feel like Soken's been the best at following in Uematsu's footsteps of the composers they've had since Uematsu left.
[2:50:26] <HeavyC4> the sword is reverse
[2:50:30] <VirtuallyCanadian> first comes raid the savage then 24man
[2:50:33] <HeavyC4> the blade is suppose to be the otherway around
[2:50:46] <+TheImmortal70> The YoRHa thing is side content
[2:50:48] <bestwaifuritsu> the blade faces exactly the way it needs to face
[2:50:48] <HeavyC4> no wait
[2:50:58] <arkv01> he has a very distinctly different style from the offline JRPG composer legends, its just bang on for MMORPGs
[2:51:05] <+FOREVERCraig> that melody is really uplifting
[2:51:10] <HeavyC4> I see. I was thinking like a regular sword but it more of a forest giant knife than a sword
[2:51:15] <+Justlaxy> I actually forgot about the later yorha stuff
[2:51:34] <%Shady_Squid> Shady_Squid subscribed at Tier 1. They've subscribed for 2 months, currently on a 2 month streak! Hey Pat, been playing 14 since your tutorial stream. I haven't had fun with an MMO like this since I played WOTK in high school. Just wanted to say thanks. Also, please thank Elmo for all his hard work.

[2:52:10] <%Maids4lyfe> apatPorgmo
[2:52:17] <%Valdorick> Music zone left, the music is dead now
[2:52:25] <+SlumberMan> WotLK is also the last time I really tried to get into WoW
[2:52:27] <%Maids4lyfe> I miss the music FeelsBadMan
[2:52:49] <%Shady_Squid> Cataclysm just.... man it wasn't good
[2:52:53] <%Valdorick> Wow, you're character is a fucking pessimist. What if that's Half-full, huh!?
[2:52:57] <VirtuallyCanadian> oh dont worry the music will return, and in greater numbers
[2:53:28] <%Maids4lyfe> oh this guy
[2:53:31] <%demegodz> Yo
[2:53:41] <%TaifuDragon> You had no fucking idea who that guy was, did you
[2:53:49] <%Maids4lyfe> nope LUL
[2:53:50] <Flickerember> I didnt
[2:53:52] <%demegodz> nope
[2:53:57] <Flickerember> my mmo memory is bad
[2:54:07] <Flickerember> dramatic reveal and Im like Nani?
[2:54:15] <%Valdorick> You went to ALL THAT FUCKING TROUBLE, and there was just a HIDDEN PASSAGE!?
[2:54:20] <Nillard> All that work to get the Ladder working and this dude just has a tunnel to the top
[2:54:21] <%brickwall35> brickwall35 subscribed with Twitch Prime. They've subscribed for 6 months! Oh you're streaming? man I wish Twitch would do it's job and notify me. Oh well. 3 for 3 on CPA (accounting) exams, one more to go. Thanks for the great content, as always!
[2:54:29] <%TaifuDragon> How could you forget your old pal Tristol, through thick and thin
[2:54:36] <%brickwall35> !uptime
[2:54:36] <@Moobot> I've been playing this game for how long? Oh only 2h 54m.
[2:54:39] <Flickerember> bro why didnt yell for an assist
[2:54:44] <+lucaflow> Imagine fixing the ladder instead of taking the secret passage LUL
[2:55:44] <%Ranryu692> but then you wouldn't have wanted to stream, and wouldn't make any money
[2:55:48] <Sol_Install> aww thanks @AngriestPat !
[2:55:56] <GarbageQueenEllie> Yaaay we waste your time
[2:55:56] <+lucaflow> Oh this is just the zone music
[2:56:03] <+lucaflow> I thought it was a instance lol
[2:56:14] <VirtuallyCanadian> its msq related
[2:56:27] <VirtuallyCanadian> it will play till you finish the msq in this area
[2:56:37] <+lucaflow> Oh that's pretty rad
[2:56:51] <%Foreluney> just pretend we arent here
[2:57:26] <BunnyEmperor> onwards to death mountain
[2:57:34] <+lucaflow> All the music in this expansion is fantastic
[2:57:46] <+lucaflow> They really went crazy with this expansion
[2:57:48] <%BlueMoonBlues> the filler arc
[2:57:50] <VirtuallyCanadian> it really did
[2:57:55] <Thalchampz> it's very filler arc
[2:57:57] <%Kyma1020> Yup
[2:57:59] <BlueLunecy> Zenos can stay, the rest can go
[2:58:00] <arkv01> yeah I remember watching the first two streams you did for stormblood and just tuned the heck out after
[2:58:01] <+lucaflow> Stormblood was the filler arc no one wanted
[2:58:10] <AdmiralButtloaf> stormblood isnt bad
[2:58:15] <%Afterman_> zenos and emet came from storm blood tho
[2:58:16] <pochiyeah> stormblood was wow's mists of pandaria LUL
[2:58:17] <BunnyEmperor> Thats kinda true
[2:58:19] <+SlumberMan> How in the world is SB a filler arc when it's the whole reason Garlemald is aggressively encroaching now?
[2:58:20] <+lucaflow> Stormblood felt like a Naruto filler arc
[2:58:21] <+ItsYaGirlMaria> the 6th zone is easily better than most of sb's zones imo
[2:58:21] <arkv01> asia was rad
[2:58:22] <AdmiralButtloaf> but not as good as hw or ShB
[2:58:23] <%PontiusPyrite> I cared about ala mhigo...
[2:58:25] <+lucaflow> Or a Bleach filler arc
[2:58:25] <%Shady_Squid> I'm still in Heavensward. I'm kinda dreading Stormblood tbh
[2:58:26] <Thalchampz> that's super true
[2:58:40] <MagicMuffinx> Hien is a good boy
[2:58:41] <bestwaifuritsu> Hien was lame.
[2:58:42] <%Fidel_Castbro> I Care about Ala Mhigo
[2:58:43] <+lucaflow> LUL Ala Mhigo
[2:58:43] <+Williamld> I still like the fake iran of Ala Mhigo better than fake Asia
[2:58:50] <VirtuallyCanadian> garlemald as always been encroaching on everyone
[2:58:51] <$Yakobro> @AngriestPat and the aether dissapearing
[2:58:51] <%MoraMiarty> no you dont fidel
[2:58:52] <AdmiralButtloaf> @Shady_Squid stormblood is still pretty good
[2:58:55] <arkv01> ala mihigo felt like poorly thought out padding
[2:58:59] <VirtuallyCanadian> they never really stopped
[2:59:00] <%Fidel_Castbro> Yes I do
[2:59:04] <+textandnumbers> i still liked stormblood despite everything
[2:59:04] <%TysonPG> im still in level 50 MSQ Hell ;(
[2:59:05] <%Fenrirlives> but Lahkshmi looks cool!
[2:59:11] <+SlumberMan> @VirtuallyCanadian Not to the extent that they're using the equivalent of chemical warfare
[2:59:12] <+Ghally> to be fair everything before ShB sucks ass in comparison
[2:59:21] <%Fidel_Castbro> It’s home to the temple of the fist
[2:59:23] <%Afterman_> comparing the two is no contest lol
[2:59:26] <Flickerember> They one upped themselves too hard
[2:59:27] <arkv01> yeye can't wait to see balamb garden StinkyCheese
[2:59:35] <Flickerember> Now no one will ng+
[2:59:46] <+textandnumbers> plus stormblood gave us a best friend
[2:59:49] <VirtuallyCanadian> in 1.0 nael was gling to drop dalamud on eorzea to kill the entire alliance
[2:59:51] <Stay_Hydrated_Bot> @angriestpat stayhyBottle You've been live for just over 3 hours. By this point in your broadcast you should have consumed at least 12oz (360mL) of water to maintain optimum hydration.
[2:59:52] <BunnyEmperor> The raids were better in final stormblood than at the start of it
[3:00:09] <%Shady_Squid> @AdmiralButtloaf I will say, everything i saw of the city designs i LIked
[3:00:17] <Flickerember> I still dont quite understand how it will work and the point of it
[3:00:24] <+SlumberMan> @VirtuallyCanadian And Nael was a crazy person who largely stopped working with the Garleans
[3:00:26] <+killer_squid1990> I'll have to play NG+ on Japanese because the English voice acting for 2.0 was NOWHERE near as good as 3.0+ in english
[3:00:31] <AdmiralButtloaf> stormblood raids are better than heavansward raids
[3:00:35] <+Crippl3> big xp and big levels for big boys
[3:00:55] <VirtuallyCanadian> balthisar backed off cause nael said he could handle the problem @slumberman
[3:01:17] <%weissguard> Er, so I might be a big dumb. I have the trial version of the game. Do I need to purchase ARR in order to update to the full game?
[3:01:22] <VirtuallyCanadian> yet they still sent the 14th legion to fight at carteneau
[3:01:33] <Thalchampz> @weissguard yes
[3:01:35] <%Valdorick> Your meat?
[3:01:41] <+SlumberMan> @VirtuallyCanadian Nael's way of "handling the problem" was just basically letting the Ascians cause a calamity
[3:01:41] <BunnyEmperor> @weissguard of course, trial is not the full game
[3:01:49] <+SlumberMan> Even Garlemald doesn't want that
[3:01:59] <Flickerember> Hm I dont recall anything cool or unique enough to ng+ but I legit have hard time remembering stuff in mmo for whatever reason
[3:02:00] <VirtuallyCanadian> news flash they do
[3:02:02] <%Ranryu692> Pat, I just wanna say thank you for your HUD layout tutorial video. It was super useful. Even just pushing HUD elements to the edges of the screen makes a huge difference
[3:02:09] <+PunishedMercer_> patron has to beat his meat or the light wins.
[3:02:41] <+SlumberMan> Garlemald doesn't want to destroy the planet, they just want to conquer everything and unite the races of man. But not in a fun way.
[3:02:43] <%weissguard> Thank you kindly. bizLove @Thalchampz @BunnyEmperor
[3:02:46] <+Crippl3> pat has FFXIV tutorial videos? where are they
[3:02:46] <collindoucet99> @angriestpat did you see that they added the Far From Home suits into Spider-Man PS4?
[3:02:55] <+Estuko> monkaS
[3:02:57] <BunnyEmperor> monkaS a floatsamurai
[3:02:59] <Thalchampz> @Crippl3 on his vod channel
[3:03:03] <%Honaoko> About Garlemald being the only threat on the Source:there's still whole unexplored "New World" that can contain all sorts of weird shit and threats to the world.
[3:03:32] <BunnyEmperor> Get ready for the ultimate bayonetta dungeon
[3:03:40] <Flickerember> The white puff on hat signifies the danger of light to this world
[3:03:43] <+killer_squid1990> Did we find out who that guy that was looking at Gaius and Estinien was yet?
[3:03:44] <%Maids4lyfe> fly me to the moon
[3:03:47] <pochiyeah> thats what she said LUL
[3:04:04] <Flickerember> katana man? I mean who else is katana man.
[3:04:06] <VirtuallyCanadian> you should alrdy know @killer_squid1990
[3:04:19] <+killer_squid1990> Oh did he get to that part?
[3:04:32] <Flickerember> No its just kinda obvious

[3:39:43] <Buttku> dwarves are ALWAYS racist
[3:39:59] <%Valdorick> Dwarves are 2 things - Drunks, and racists.
[3:40:00] <jackythefrost> Dwarves hate the knife-ears
[3:40:10] <+blewbeary> why is there no option to say no to him?
[3:40:13] <%Ranryu692> I'll take care of Jiren
[3:40:31] <%Gogogolem> @AngriestPat before you go talk to the vendor

[3:42:18] <Caitiri> mew
[3:42:19] <+PunishedMercer_> that actually looks really cool
[3:42:22] <%ArcanumMBD> And the Nin daggers are pizza cutters
[3:42:27] <%weissguard> That's great.
[3:42:40] <+ItsYaGirlMaria> wow youre getting no queues for these instances
[3:42:55] <Overloard> 🤔
[3:43:17] <%Valdorick> Of course he's a blackmage, what, you thought he was a whitemage!?… well only when he heals.
[3:43:22] <%demon_shadowplays> hey pat I just connected my discord to my twitch how do i get access to your discord?
[3:43:33] <$valriot> I don't remember this song playing
[3:43:39] <+Kelpus> Exarch just a big fanboy Kappa
[3:43:40] <+notgac> Per the trust system, Exarch is an "All-rounder"
[3:43:43] <+meatgeneral69> just finished trial 2, please look forward to it
[3:44:26] <%Valdorick> @demon_shadowplays in the same screen you connected your discord to twitch (connections), you should have an invite link to the discord
[3:44:28] <BunnyEmperor> He is everything
[3:44:37] <%Gogogolem> So this one time , i saw a perfectly good blonde girl turn into a horrible ginger because another stacked blonde stole her soul.
[3:44:43] <%Mythicalbrit> He's whatever he fcking wants to be
[3:44:50] <+Kelpus> ^ He is everything, in the trust system he can play any role. Which speaks volumes for his capability \o/
[3:45:05] <BunnyEmperor> He can switch jobs during combat LUL
[3:45:09] <%RittiFruity> He's Blue mage LUL
[3:45:28] <%solomonpun> Are there any plans to make blue mage an actual job?
[3:45:29] <%Gogogolem> The Crystal Exarch is secretly Paige.
[3:45:45] <%demon_shadowplays> @Valdorick Thanks!
[3:45:49] <$valriot> It's Talltaru
[3:45:49] <VioletHeart> I see it.
[3:45:52] <+Kelpus> Nah it's totally Tsundere Lahabrea or something Kappa
[3:45:53] <VioletHeart> I see where they're going with this.
[3:45:56] <vaan_ratsbane> the crystal exarch is obviously hildibrand
[3:45:57] <%NWR_James> EXarch Elmo
[3:46:00] <+TheImmortal70> Pats going to flip his shit
[3:46:12] <%Fatmanjoggin> I can't believe the exarch was Raubahns arm
[3:46:13] <VioletHeart> To be fair he's 100+ years old and that gives you a lot of time to practice.
[3:46:18] <%Gogogolem> No no the exatch is Patron from the future.
[3:46:21] <GarbageQueenEllie> I can't believe the Crystal Exarch is actually Baseball
[3:46:38] <+TheImmortal70> Baseball after da accident
[3:46:39] <%NWR_James> @Gogogolem I thought about making that joke but then worried I'd be right and get banned for spoilers
[3:46:49] <+lucaflow> @AngriestPat Does salted earth actullay suck now or is it just an overreaction?
[3:46:54] <%NWR_James> Baba is Exarch
[3:46:57] <BunnyEmperor> wait is it one more level until STANDO POWER? oh boiii
[3:46:59] <%weissguard> I always knew that the Crystal Exarch was just genderbent Annie from AoT. NotLikeThis
[3:47:08] <jackythefrost> I can't believe the Exarch is Wakka
[3:47:09] <%demon_shadowplays> so far nothing @Valdorick
[3:47:11] <+TheImmortal70> Salted earth doesn’t suck it just got weirdly nerfed
[3:47:15] <%Gogogolem> machinist also get a stand.
[3:47:20] <%Valdorick> There is exactly one thing I know about the Crystal Exarch's identity, and its the stupidest fucking thing to know about for a game I played 4 fucking years ago and based off ONE fucking thing Pat said to Piage this week.
[3:47:20] <+TheImmortal70> And THAT sucks
[3:47:23] <+blewbeary> those dang al bheds @jackythefrost
[3:47:32] <+lucaflow> damn man
[3:47:35] <+ItsYaGirlMaria> unleash got buffed and you got an aoe combo so it was probably nerfed to match that
[3:47:46] <+Kelpus> Maybe... maybe he's Doctor Strange! LUL
[3:47:51] <BunnyEmperor> His trick is casting an lb for 2 hours LUL
[3:47:51] <%Caitiri> Caitiri subscribed at Tier 2. They've subscribed for 7 months, currently on a 7 month streak! Yay!
[3:47:53] <%Gogogolem> he has lb
[3:47:56] <Jolnir> the exarch is quinna
[3:48:03] <+TheImmortal70> I mean yeah that’s the reason they’ll give but it wasn’t necessary
[3:48:09] <+Kelpus> Casters should take a lesson from Exarch and use LB on big pulls.
[3:48:14] <%weissguard> Oh god. The Forgiven Cowardice looks like the dog from FMA. NotLikeThis
[3:48:15] <%Gogogolem> The exarch is a green dps.
[3:48:26] <%Gogogolem> Uwaah shock!
[3:48:28] <+TheImmortal70> Nothing about DRK screams broken except blackest night
[3:48:49] <jackythefrost> Blackest Night is the best
[3:48:51] <Sol_Install> whose that sin eater behind them??
[3:48:52] <Graxe_> Aw yeah, Syrcus Tower fight theme
[3:48:53] <%Fatmanjoggin> Yeah if blackest night could break
[3:49:01] <%NWR_James> MUSIC IS HARD PAT! They ran out of chicken!

[3:49:10] <$jobbedbone> what about DRK screams "DAMAGED"?
[3:49:15] <Sol_Install> forgiven Hypocrisy huh?
[3:49:16] <DeathGodSkeith> lol i wonder why theyre playing that music
[3:49:19] <%Divryne> I wonder why though? LUL
[3:49:20] <%ArcanumMBD> well yeah you're fighting with the Crystal Exarch of the Crystal Tower
[3:49:21] <BunnyEmperor> I've seen too much of that tower during the moogle event
[3:49:29] <%Gogogolem> Patron has Damaged tatooed on his forehead its why he wears the hat.
[3:49:30] <%ArcanumMBD> It's basically his theme
[3:51:01] <arkv01> goddamn I loves me some crystal tower
[3:51:10] <BunnyEmperor> Say what Pat LUL
[3:51:24] <Jolnir> pat is damaged goods
[3:51:25] <Forester_Skippy> say what you will about ff3 but the songs that got into 14 are great
[3:51:32] <%Alazull> Oh cool, this is just a little further along than where I'm at
[3:51:44] <Inollia> you can never go wrong with ff3 music
[3:51:44] <jackythefrost> Updated version of FF3 is great
[3:51:55] <Inollia> rip ff3 eureka theme though :/
[3:52:00] <%Alazull> @AngriestPat Dude DRK soooo good now. Might switch from maining PLD.

[3:52:24] <tralfamad0re> monkaS
[3:52:26] <+Kelpus> Exarch carry PogChamp
[3:52:33] <BunnyEmperor> Tank lb and benediction LUL
[3:52:37] <%solomonpun> He job switched?
[3:52:45] <+TheImmortal70> He’s every job
[3:52:48] <+Fynale> he's a 1.0 cross classer
[3:52:51] <%Alazull> Crystal Exarch can do all roles
[3:52:52] <jackythefrost> Exarch is all the casting jobs
[3:52:52] <Forester_Skippy> nah hes a sage
[3:52:56] <Inollia> btw in the trust system the crystal exarch can play all roles
[3:53:03] <%Valdorick> He can also be a Paladin.
[3:53:11] <%solomonpun> what class is he if he tanks?
[3:53:13] <%solomonpun> oh
[3:53:30] <%Alazull> As he puts it, he "summons forth a sword and a shield"
[3:53:32] <snowmanse> What class is he if he is dps?
[3:53:41] <%Valdorick> Blackmage
[3:53:41] <bestwaifuritsu> black mage
[3:53:43] <+lucaflow> BLM
[3:53:46] <jackythefrost> Exarchs big Crystal dick can handle all the roles given to it
[3:54:14] <%Valdorick> The real question is - is he a better BLM than Yshtola? Kappa
[3:54:25] <Forester_Skippy> man i just hit 80 and using living shadow feels so good
[3:55:00] <jackythefrost> Time for METAL GEAR DWARF

[4:07:56] <%Lapinelis> I really hate that one
[4:08:08] <$Yakobro> ROCK WIFE
[4:08:08] <%demegodz> Palm abuse
[4:08:13] <%demegodz> ROCK WIFE
[4:08:15] <Flickerember> hit palm with fist got as much as play as the karate chop in Deus Ex HR
[4:08:15] <BunnyEmperor> rock wife LUL
[4:08:34] <+Kelpus> Not the trolley NotLikeThis
[4:08:37] <$Yakobro> LUL
[4:08:44] <Flickerember> trolley chub
[4:08:52] <alrobot2014> but what if you made a trolley all the way up to the island
[4:08:53] <Foggysheep> everything is a trolly
[4:08:57] <alrobot2014> COULD YOU lMAGINE
[4:09:02] <jackythefrost> He's got a boner for the trolley
[4:09:06] <+Edrem> His trolley is the trolley that will pierce the heavens
[4:09:13] <Flickerember> and Mt. Gulg
[4:09:38] <%Lapinelis> It's literally everyone
[4:10:03] <+alphonseisbest> @angriestpat did I miss the 79 dungeon? I just got here
[4:10:09] <%solomonpun> All the warriors!
[4:10:11] <+notgac> it's soon
[4:10:13] <+The_UnfathoMarble> is that a vulture LAMA?
[4:10:13] <%Lapinelis> No @alphonseisbest
[4:10:20] <alrobot2014> where are the doggie boys
[4:10:28] <BunnyEmperor> a roebot
[4:10:37] <Sol_Install> wheres the fairies?
[4:10:42] <%some_sunflowers> I'm so excited for Pat to start heading into this part of the game.
[4:10:45] <%Lapinelis> Fairies are dicks
[4:10:50] <%some_sunflowers> I just want to see other peoples' reactions to it at this point
[4:10:56] <Sol_Install> They own Pat a favor tho
[4:11:03] <Axle13j> screeee
[4:11:05] <+alphonseisbest> wait why are we building a robot?!
[4:11:15] <kanodin> the hype train basically starts here and goes to the end of the game
[4:11:22] <+Victorious_Drago> How big excited are you Pat? How many units of big excited are you currently experiencing?
[4:11:25] <Muraikun> can't wait for pat to get to the end of the next zone to see his reaction, it's gonna be awesome
[4:11:36] <%Lapinelis> It wouldn't be a jrpg if you didn't punch god with a giant robot
[4:11:46] <Muraikun> get in the robot warrior of light!
[4:12:05] <jackythefrost> Big robot gonna fight the mountain
[4:12:12] <Flickerember> If only I could remember more of Beast 9
[4:12:29] <%Master_Van> I missed up till now, thats a pretty badass sword!
[4:12:30] <%Lapinelis> Biggest issue with the expansion? Mount speed 0 by default the maps are fucking huge and it takes aeons to get from place to place at the start
[4:12:32] <elisascarlet> the fact this music is playing here makes this so perfect
[4:13:00] <jackythefrost> It's VERY easy to get the maps tho
[4:13:04] <Flickerember> She outside
[4:13:11] <Flickerember> I got fucked up by that too
[4:13:21] <BunnyEmperor> You have to go back around
[4:13:24] <+Victorious_Drago> I love this thrilling and epic music as he just kind of wanders around an abandoned castle
[4:13:26] <$Yakobro> LOL
[4:13:27] <BunnyEmperor> I did the same mistake LUL
[4:13:28] <Muraikun> me too, but I talked to her through the wall @Flickerember

[4:17:49] <+valkuma> have you seen that you have to do like 340 fates to get the ability to use the bicolor gemstones
[4:18:10] <%Lapinelis> No that's wrong
[4:18:16] <%Lapinelis> 12 fates gets you the riding map
[4:18:20] <+valkuma> you can only buy riding maps unless you get every zone to rank 3
[4:18:21] <%Lapinelis> at 70 stones :p

[4:19:31] <Sol_Install> We're throwing everything into this huh?
[4:19:32] <Overloard> use the souls of the dead to pierce the heavens and punch god
[4:19:33] <%Lapinelis> People are a good substitute for Aether in this world
[4:19:34] <%solomonpun> Soul-powered robots, this is Gurren Lagaan
[4:19:38] <+Noponiz> This sequence is so good
[4:19:39] <+notgac> they're powered by prayer. kinda like miniprimals
[4:19:46] <+Noponiz> everyone coming together so intensely
[4:19:58] <+Noponiz> it feels like such a good payoff to all the adventures in the first
[4:20:08] <ToneBacas> where are the Bionicles at?
[4:20:11] <TioXyco> heartstones? so you're burning a card game to fuel your robot?
[4:20:17] <+sixcubit> kinda annoyed that most of the races in this game are just "dev's fursona"

[4:55:26] <+Ell1ot> who is winning?
[4:55:34] <jackythefrost> Final Dungeon is the most insane shit I have ever seen in this game
[4:55:38] <KnightDio> the one who can izuna drop the other
[4:55:39] <%king_wragles> @Deft_Thought Seriously though, these are Bayonetta tier names
[4:55:40] <%ovan20> i put money on elmo!
[4:55:43] <+Edrem> Annoyingly, you can get the lvl 79 MSQ quest, but it requires the lvl 80 role quest
[4:55:44] <BunnyEmperor> battle of legends
[4:55:50] <%Deft_Thought> @king_wragles 100%
[4:56:28] <BunnyEmperor> oh its gonna get more bayonetta soon
[4:56:36] <KnightDio> I love how every DK attacks are named after edgy seinen mangas
[4:56:53] <Forester_Skippy> i love how every single boss this expansion has been very mechanic heavy for dungeon bosses
[4:56:58] <%Deft_Thought> This thing's weird lizard body and Lion head are creeping me out
[4:57:00] <%Ranryu692> that's what she said
[4:57:17] <%king_wragles> @BunnyEmperor okay, my friends and acquaintances have been trying to sell me on this game. How have you so quickly done better than their combined efforts?
[4:57:23] <%king_wragles> I need more details man! Tell me more!
[4:57:35] <+Dubcrookz> hey pat help the queue go faster
[4:57:52] <BunnyEmperor> just stick by and watch LUL
[4:57:56] <%Lapinelis> Yup
[4:58:07] <%ArcanumMBD> its 79, you're always allowed an extra level
[4:58:10] <+ItsYaGirlMaria> thats why it ilvl syncs pat
[4:58:19] <Rentixx> ayeee demon wall
[4:58:20] <Calek> it's that library boss!
[4:58:22] <%Valdorick> Defeat the wallmaster
[4:58:23] <Forester_Skippy> it was the same for the stormblood one tho
[4:58:23] <+sixcubit> is there really such a substantial difference between level 79 and 80?
[4:58:24] <+valkuma> What do you get when you cross an Orange with Minfilia? A Nectar-RYNE
[4:58:24] <$shadow1man9> It's the X9 dungeon, you're always allowed to be level cap in those
[4:58:25] <+plasticss> the music in all the dungeons are so good man
[4:58:28] <+Kelpus> I miss OG knockback into pit demon wall
[4:58:31] <%weissguard> Awwwww YEAH
[4:58:32] <%solomonpun> is this the nier stuff?
[4:58:37] <%Lapinelis> On a side note, welcome to Nier, pat
[4:58:38] <Graxe_> You have your full kit at 80
[4:58:39] <+Kelpus> Nope, just main storylline
[4:58:39] <+Solshine11> I mean, you could be level 60 in Gubel normal
[4:58:44] <%Valdorick> Well, level 80 is your last ability
[4:58:46] <Graxe_> That's the main difference
[4:58:48] <gekizenbu> this is MSQ, Nier is in a few months
[4:58:53] <%king_wragles> @sixcubit in most MMOs, the last level in a level cap usually has a larger XP bar than the rest % wise
[4:58:56] <vaan_ratsbane> nier stuff probably only comes out in 5-6 months
[4:59:03] <Overloard> monkaS
[4:59:03] <%Lapinelis> I know, but this area gets very nier :p
[4:59:04] <BunnyEmperor> doesnt make a difference for sam tho
[4:59:06] <KnightDio> wait, nier stuff ?
[4:59:12] <KnightDio> is there another crossover event ?
[4:59:13] <+Solshine11> Nier is in late September
[4:59:14] <+SlumberMan> Probably more like 4ish months
[4:59:17] <Calek> I can't wait to be a bunny girl wearing 2B's outfit
[4:59:35] <%weissguard> MMF
[4:59:48] <vaan_ratsbane> this game's alliance raid story will be about 2P
[4:59:51] <%king_wragles> Can we just talk about that sick ass sword? PLEASE?
[4:59:52] <Stay_Hydrated_Bot> @angriestpat stayhyBottle You've been live for just over 5 hours. By this point in your broadcast you should have consumed at least 20oz (600mL) of water to maintain optimum hydration.
[4:59:54] <Graxe_> Suddenly heaven, but also the copied city
[4:59:57] <%Valdorick> That's a near alright.
[4:59:57] <artoflec> okay yeah the sun was some dumb bullshit
[4:59:59] <BunnyEmperor> live terraforming
[5:00:03] <%weissguard> Bruh, it is SO SICK.
[5:00:06] <%Valdorick> neir, stupid auto correct.
[5:00:13] <%Deft_Thought> inb4 fighting twin girls
[5:00:18] <vaan_ratsbane> Vauthry's like "get out of my mountain I'm playing minecraft!"
[5:00:27] <alrobot2014> we already fought twin girls
[5:00:35] <alrobot2014> they were clowns tho
[5:00:41] <%king_wragles> Vauthry's deepest desire is to be the ultimate alpha gamer
[5:00:41] <%Valdorick> "Hydalon said its my turn to play the X-Box"
[5:00:47] <jackythefrost> Mmm Clown GF
[5:00:52] <Commander_Spyke> pvpFATTERZ
[5:01:08] <KnightDio> honk honk of love
[5:01:19] <%Unlimited_> what is this dmc1 shit
[5:01:20] <Calek> interesting how conformity is one of the Forgiven Sin Eaters
[5:01:28] <%Kirby_Sauce> "yeaaaa, we really didn't wanna do more textures
[5:01:44] <gekizenbu> even the white seems decently textured and shaded though
[5:01:50] <Cryomancer_Maurice> Why did Final Fantasy steal this PSO stage?
[5:02:07] <KnightDio> what is this SMT shit
[5:02:09] <InugamiTheHound> this looks like its from Nier:automata (I still haven't finished that game FYI)
[5:02:15] <jackythefrost> Its a Rubix Cube
[5:02:19] <KnightDio> what the fuck is that cube from persona 3 doing here
[5:02:21] <ZaDoorman> @cryomancer_maurice every MMO has stolen from PSO since PSO released
[5:02:22] <gekizenbu> Fight the Gamercube Boss
[5:02:24] <%Deft_Thought> Yeah, this looks SMT as fuck
[5:02:25] <Graxe_> While you were off building a giant rock robot, I was making paradise
[5:02:30] <BunnyEmperor> welcome to Paradiso LUL
[5:02:31] <%king_wragles> You all heard that beep right?
[5:02:33] <%demegodz> Fight the Gamer Cube
[5:02:34] <$Yakobro> IT'S A CUBE
[5:02:34] <+SlumberMan> It's a Square!... Enix!
[5:02:35] <%Deft_Thought> IS THAT BRAHMIN?
[5:02:36] <%Takreth> Square Enix
[5:02:36] <alrobot2014> yep
[5:02:38] <bear_breaker20> Saturn Worship?
[5:02:39] <%Valdorick> Fight the Gamercube, Pat; exert your dominance.
[5:02:39] <TheHotStuven> I honestly thought that was my discord bloop just now LUL
[5:02:40] <%king_wragles> kk
[5:02:41] <alrobot2014> that was pat's discord
[5:02:41] <%Ranryu692> kill the cube!
[5:02:44] <Commander_Spyke> This boss is so awesome
[5:02:46] <jackythefrost> Its Brahmin from SMT
[5:02:53] <Graxe_> Or you know, cube form Ozma
[5:02:53] <InugamiTheHound> "I like cubes"-Pat 2019 please clip that
[5:02:56] <%king_wragles> FORGIVEN GEOMETRY
[5:02:57] <Graxe_> Could be that too
[5:03:02] <%Divryne> GAMER CUBE.
[5:03:06] <ZaDoorman> this looks like that one area from Nier Automata.
[5:03:06] <%TysonPG> @alrobot2014 thank you i was so confused
[5:03:07] <BunnyEmperor> this boss concept is great
[5:03:12] <%king_wragles> oh wait, I can read the name now
[5:03:13] <KnightDio> Whimsy cube
[5:03:23] <alrobot2014> that's pretty cool
[5:03:27] <%Takreth> Its a rubix cube of pain
[5:03:34] <KnightDio> Love these boss fights, reminds me of the chess piece dungeon
[5:03:39] <Overloard> forgive me father for a have whimsed
[5:03:51] <%Deft_Thought> And then Dante shows up and cuts the cube in half
[5:03:52] <alrobot2014> the rubik's cube was forgiven its sin of being hard
[5:03:52] <Graxe_> Commit the sin of whimsy
[5:04:04] <bear_breaker20> forgive me father fore i doth commited adultery on the pornhub
[5:04:07] <InugamiTheHound> death the kid would love the perfect symmetry on this boss fight
[5:04:29] <KnightDio> we got circles everyone
[5:04:37] <TheHotStuven> Big circles for big boys
[5:04:39] <alrobot2014> we've got circles born of cubes
[5:04:47] <excedebuster> Hello how are we doing today everyone? saiiHai
[5:04:47] <KnightDio> this is some nerd shit
[5:04:49] <+Estuko> back from dog walking, oh platinum cube
[5:05:27] <%Valdorick> Wait so... All these Squares make a circle?
[5:05:31] <%logoth_> This boss sure has a lot of health
[5:05:33] <+Conzanagi> Will Pat finally overcome the Cube?
[5:05:41] <KnightDio> it's pretty common for ff14 bosses
[5:05:42] <+StrawberryPantsu> LOOK AT THAT SMT BOSS
[5:05:43] <gekizenbu> the gamercube is the means by which all is revealed
[5:05:48] <KnightDio> even kinda short compared to others
[5:06:00] <%Lapinelis> I still can't get over it that ninjas summon goddamn frogs
[5:06:05] <TheHotStuven> @gekizenbu Nyx LUL
[5:06:06] <KnightDio> listen, naruto ok
[5:06:15] <KnightDio> sometimes you just gotta believe it

[5:06:49] <gekizenbu> the peak of shit mountain
[5:06:49] <Flickerember> Oh I have rando question for chat. Other than roulettes whats best way to get XPs for first lv to get into ShB dungeons
[5:06:53] <+justianxix> Fuck ORDER

[5:07:01] <Calek> do the sidequests
[5:07:03] <%weissguard> Kreygasm Kreygasm Kreygasm Kreygasm
[5:07:05] <gekizenbu> that's pretty much the best way, but also sidequests
[5:07:06] <ClumzyDragon> rooD
[5:07:07] <%Deft_Thought> I've missed a lot of the streams for FFXIV
[5:07:07] <KnightDio> Main Story Quest, Roulettes, Sidequests in between
[5:07:07] <+Estuko> Stupid Sexy Sin eaters
[5:07:11] <%weissguard> I'm a sucker for this aesthetic.
[5:07:11] <Tubit> Fates?
[5:07:12] <jackythefrost> @Flickerember Palace of the dead
[5:07:14] <+SlumberMan> @Flickerember Heaven on High
[5:07:14] <%Deft_Thought> How did Tubbo get so damn tough?
[5:07:19] <Overloard> ninja goin for loot mid pull
[5:07:20] <%Lapinelis> @Flickerember Side quests, roulettes, fate grind
[5:07:20] <KnightDio> fates aren't that useful for xp tbh
[5:07:22] <+plasticss> that was cool visual
[5:07:24] <+Edrem> Fate grinding is good if you haven't unlocked riding maps yet
[5:07:25] <excedebuster> I have no idea what we’re doing? kaiaS
[5:07:25] <%solomonpun> lol venery means sexual indulgence, of course that's the name for the sexy angels.
[5:07:45] <+Kelpus> LUL
[5:07:48] <Tubit> the fate xp buff is good
[5:07:54] <RossMirage> @AngriestPat Pat, it is in your best interest to show Woolie the incoming Trial boss.
[5:08:00] <BappoSama> Man, this shit looks gorgeous..
[5:08:08] <vaan_ratsbane> this music is so good
[5:08:15] <Flickerember> I see. Fates sounded like something I need to do cause bicolor stones or something anyway. Thx for halp.
[5:08:17] <%king_wragles> Okay, what does LB mean?
[5:08:21] <GarbageQueenEllie> Can't get my mind out of those memories
[5:08:22] <%king_wragles> LIMIT BREAK
[5:08:22] <%Valdorick> Limit Break
[5:08:23] <alrobot2014> limit break
[5:08:27] <Flickerember> Limit Breaku
[5:08:27] <%king_wragles> God I'm dumb

[5:08:30] <%weissguard> Genkai wa koeru
[5:08:31] <+Kelpus> Limit Break. It's a party gauge built up over time.
[5:08:33] <vaan_ratsbane> <se.7> limit break
[5:08:34] <%weissguard> Wait a minute.
[5:08:35] <%Valdorick> LB2 means a 2 bar Limit Break
[5:08:37] <BunnyEmperor> cool animation button
[5:08:45] <KnightDio> Big Damage button
[5:08:49] <%Mekhet09> FUCK i dced in the final dungeon. Now I get to wait an hour to come back in.
[5:08:54] <+Estuko> Soul Eater's great

[5:08:57] <%demegodz> Soul Eater, good anime
[5:08:59] <bestwaifuritsu> what lb1 and 2 does dancer use? the same ranged crossbow silliness?
[5:08:59] <Mr_Strut> Same thing, really
[5:09:01] <Flickerember> Also why no one says gunbreaker as GUNBREAKA like excited japanese announcer
[5:09:04] <%king_wragles> That sun was crazy af tho
[5:09:06] <TheHotStuven> AYAYA
[5:09:10] <%king_wragles> Excalibur was cool
[5:09:17] <Flickerember> Dancer dances then I PULL OUT MAH GUN
[5:09:19] <KnightDio> still not over the SMT cube tbh
[5:09:26] <+Estuko> R1 class
[5:09:26] <KnightDio> what's it's story
[5:09:27] <bxdragon> Gunbreaker in the Kamen Rider guy voice. Do it now.
[5:09:34] <excedebuster> I watched Soul eater in middle school saiiThug
[5:09:38] <%ssks123> @bestwaifuritsu yeah they use the crossbow
[5:09:39] <%ssks123> its dumb
[5:09:54] <BunnyEmperor> the final boss fight here is kind of fucked if you do it for the first time
[5:09:57] <vaan_ratsbane> there was a man named Pat who wanted the world clean and his edges perpendicular, thus the smt cube came to be
[5:10:08] <%TysonPG> Soul Eater had a weird foot fetish thing going on
[5:10:23] <Commander_Spyke> @bunnyemperor yeah I just did it today and I didn't couldn't grasp the mechanic
[5:10:32] <jackythefrost> Soul Eaters anime makes me mad cause it did the same thing FMA 2003 did

[5:11:02] <+REDtheBEAST> Spaghetti of Pain!

[5:11:07] <Sol_Install> Oh so forgiven Festival
[5:11:09] <KnightDio> goopy goop monster
[5:11:17] <%Kirby_Sauce> soul eater had an everything else fetish

[5:13:54] <+justianxix> Which one is real
[5:14:00] <%Deft_Thought> Real one has the halos?
[5:14:01] <Sol_Install> my ass just clench there

[5:14:05] <%logoth_> [ I dont know what to do with this ]
[5:14:10] <+Fynale> the real one is the one with the golden aura
[5:14:16] <Calek> for some reason I couldn't see the orange "don't stand here" do hickey's very well on my screen when I did this boss
[5:14:27] <%Lapinelis> I like how they're doing these now instead of the hour long MSQ like you had with Prae and shit
[5:14:33] <Flickerember> I somehow dodged all that first time. second time kept eating it
[5:14:37] <+Raidou24> They all are real just the only safe zone is near the halo one
[5:14:51] <%weissguard> Kreygasm PogChamp Kreygasm PogChamp

[5:16:01] <%Lapinelis> They yellow floor ain't helping either
[5:16:15] <dekkitout> I'll hazard a guess and say that this is a final boss? How we lookin' chat?
[5:16:17] <KnightDio> Yeah, the yellow aoe notif, on top of yellow attacks, with yellow aura on the withe and yellow backdrop isn't the more readable action there is
[5:16:25] <+Edrem> final boss of this dungeon

[5:48:12] <Hidashi13> The gun?
[5:48:12] <%VanaSkiller> The Yakuzies never ended
[5:48:14] <dredshift> Fat Evil is defeated, enter the Big Gay Evil
[5:48:14] <Shwepie> Bullets can go through energy fields?
[5:48:15] <$NitronStreams> MARK 2
[5:48:15] <%Deft_Thought> Typical FFXIV "Ayyy, I'm the REAL BAD"
[5:48:18] <%Fidel_Castbro> He has literally said from the start he was gonna make sure the rejoining happens
[5:48:23] <ZaDoorman> @esotericodyssey I've already finish the expansions MSQ, I'm just watching Pat's reaction to the craziness ahead.
[5:48:29] <%Valdorick> Wait, so the TOWER is also from the Source!? CRYSTAL TOWER MARK 2!?
[5:48:29] <%PlainSimpleTailor> He's SUPER RIGHT
[5:48:30] <Darkmega97> The gun is the most powerful artifact
[5:48:30] <snowmanse> Of course he has the pre-empire garlean revolver.
[5:48:32] <gekizenbu> [Ascian Plot In Progress]
[5:48:34] <bxdragon> I like how they just stand there and let him do this LUL
[5:48:34] <$KnivesEve> Hey team DO SOMETHING
[5:48:35] <ClumzyDragon> plot bullets can go through anything
[5:48:40] <+PunishedMercer_> meanwhile no one does anything cuz muh monologue
[5:48:42] <arkv01> this evil is DELICIOUS
[5:48:52] <Inollia> well to be fair he has a gun
[5:48:52] <Overloard> ardbert saves the day?
[5:48:52] <%budyd> just enough for the plot
[5:48:53] <TheHotStuven> Only a baby shot
[5:48:54] <KnightAsteran> @deft_thought we've always know he was the real big bad
[5:48:55] <Graxe_> Not in the heart, but maybe the side.
[5:48:55] <KnightDio> he shot him with a script bullet, don't question it
[5:48:56] <fehraf> How did no one notice him??
[5:48:56] <californaya> He got shot in a non-vital heart
[5:48:58] <Flickerember> tiny boolet
[5:48:59] <Darkmega97> it was just a small gun shoot
[5:49:00] <%MagickBurritoh> It's only a a bullet
[5:49:02] <+Cyoctane> Gun beats magic every time. But what if someone had a gun made of magic?
[5:49:04] <+Fynale> @PunishedMercer_ well i mean he's inter dimensional super bad ass
[5:49:04] <+TripleHelix> nine lives
[5:49:04] <+ItsYaGirlMaria> shot him in the safe zone
[5:49:06] <Sol_Install> Shot him in the sleep spot
[5:49:08] <MasterDecoder> That's a dope sword @AngriestPat
[5:49:10] <+superdoomshroom> he used gauss round Kappa

[5:49:34] <Darkmega97> yea you suck pat
[5:49:36] <Sol_Install> wow
[5:49:37] <%Valdorick> "I thought you were a PURE ascian"
[5:49:39] <KnightDio> no shit
[5:49:39] <$NitronStreams> How PATRONizing
[5:49:40] <+Fynale> "uh duh i'm evil"
[5:49:41] <Sol_Install> You know his plan
[5:49:43] <Graxe_> Emet-Selch gave you a chance, but you failed his secret test of character that you didn't know about.
[5:49:44] <BunnyEmperor> No patron in patronage?
[5:49:47] <ZaDoorman> Emet is such a good villain, he's like the XIV equivalent of Arden.
[5:49:49] <%Gogogolem> Patron RAge!
[5:50:03] <bxdragon> Arden wasn't a good villain though....
[5:50:05] <vaan_ratsbane> To cause a rejoining a tremendous amount of aether has to pass to the source. If you contained the light, and returned, you'd do exactly that
[5:50:10] <%budyd> I LOVE when villains give plot exposition.
[5:50:12] <%Valdorick> Warriors of Darkness were punk bitches who couldn't even do Emet's Plan LUL
[5:50:15] <ClumzyDragon> OMG it was hem along
[5:50:18] <jackythefrost> Arden wasn't a good villain tho
[5:50:24] <+Fynale> Ascians have never lied to us btw
[5:50:27] <AdmiralButtloaf> oh your god
[5:50:29] <ancrest_tant> My b dawg
[5:50:29] <arkv01> its not like I like you guys b-b-baka
[5:50:29] <Darkmega97> dude get rid of that pimple on you forehead
[5:50:32] <RupanSen> this dude's haircut was scientifically engineered to provoke anger
[5:50:32] <+Fynale> they may give half truths but they never lie
[5:50:42] <bear_breaker20> Ascians are our greatest ally, you may as well say
[5:50:43] <%MagickBurritoh> huh
[5:50:45] <%Valdorick> "I was gonna let you mudbloods into my pure household!"
[5:50:53] <BunnyEmperor> GENUINELY
[5:50:53] <bxdragon> Arden wasn't even a villain. He is more of anti-dragon in charge.
[5:50:55] <+TheImmortal70> He wanted to see if you could become the light equivalent of an ascian basically
[5:50:57] <KnightDio> your weak pat W E A K
[5:50:57] <Sol_Install> he has like Five souls + his own
[5:50:57] <TheHotStuven> Why doesnt he try it? Fucking ass
[5:50:59] <+Edrem> Pat needs a dimmer switch
[5:51:02] <ZaDoorman> Arden was great IMO. I like when villains have actual reason for what they do, even if it means killing millions.
[5:51:04] <SilverFeng> "just blowing up over here?
[5:51:29] <+Fynale> @AngriestPat man talk about a glow up right?

[5:59:45] <%QuadraticGravity> Test
[5:59:51] <Stay_Hydrated_Bot> @angriestpat stayhyBottle You've been live for just over 6 hours. By this point in your broadcast you should have consumed at least 24oz (720mL) of water to maintain optimum hydration.
[6:00:09] <%extrwi> headtracking gave us the awesome 1.0 laughter gif
[6:00:13] <InugamiTheHound> @AngriestPat when are you gonna leave for RTX?
[6:00:29] <%terminallyCapriciousz> Sometime tomorrow I think, Inugami
[6:00:30] <arkv01> he's leaving the day after I think
[6:00:37] <+Kelpus> 1.0? I thought it was a 2.0 beta gif.
[6:00:41] <%Valdorick> So, is the constant day back?
[6:00:49] <%Lapinelis> Eternal Light is back
[6:00:54] <KatabolicRage> day is too weak a word for the everlasting light weather

[6:01:59] <+Boombay1213> @arkv01 I have no idea, that's why I asked.
[6:02:17] <+Fynale> you'dhave to go full light zombie probably

[6:24:44] <%McCloud90> McCloud90 subscribed with Twitch Prime. They've subscribed for 5 months, currently on a 2 month streak! 5 months of my favorite sarcastic shitlords and god king Elmo
[6:24:50] <%NYCrownlessKing> Pat has to hit 80 first if he wants to get hsi artifact.
[6:25:01] <BunnyEmperor> cutscene will happen
[6:25:01] <TeepPhoenix> And cook your minion.
[6:25:53] <Dragovus> It's his porn stash
[6:25:57] <+Edrem> long cutscene is long
[6:26:03] <TeepPhoenix> Ecco the Dolphin
[6:26:13] <EsotericOdyssey> hey it's urianger
[6:26:15] <BunnyEmperor> this is the best LUL
[6:26:25] <%NYCrownlessKing> no @AngriestPat
[6:26:28] <SailingSaturn> nope
[6:26:29] <+Raidou24> Nope
[6:26:32] <+SlumberMan> Cuz Urianger is a specialist when it comes to making things vague and keeping secrets
[6:26:35] <+BloodyBurney> In the following scene, Urianger is literally handed the script
[6:26:40] <+Fynale> yep big future
[6:26:46] <@Moobot> Whoa I don't even shout that much! (@EsotericOdyssey) (warning)
[6:26:52] <+Raidou24> He was stuck in the Waking Sands uptill now
[6:26:54] <+superdoomshroom> the only person who's met Gr'aha is Cid I believe
[6:27:00] <EsotericOdyssey> he got to READ the SCRIPT
[6:27:04] <+killer_squid1990> I WANT TO HUG HIM
[6:27:06] <%theturtlebar> Cid, Nero, and Rambroes
[6:27:06] <%Lapinelis> Y'shtola went "You shady as all fuck" and ignored him. Thancred is an minfilia idiot. And the twins are stupid too.
[6:27:11] <%Lapinelis> Adorable, but stupid
[6:27:11] <BunnyEmperor> it will be revealed
[6:27:14] <SailingSaturn> and that Roe whose name I never remember cirISee
[6:27:19] <Graxe_> Even Urianger is tired of this shit
[6:27:21] <%Lapinelis> Urianger is the only one he could've told it to
[6:27:21] <+TheImmortal70> No wonder Urianger uses Triple Triad cards for Astronomy and only ever throws them at people, he can't ACTUALLY see the future
[6:27:25] <SailingSaturn> and Nero!
[6:27:31] <+ItsYaGirlMaria> Even Urianger cant handle it
[6:27:35] <+valkuma> CAT ?
[6:27:43] <%Yadogari> CID LIVED LUL
[6:28:00] <%NYCrownlessKing> i wonder if he's from the future..did he see the other course of the future?
[6:28:02] <%Gogogolem> Good god Cids fucking unkillable
[6:28:05] <+valkuma> paige was right...everyones a catboy
[6:28:11] <%NYCrownlessKing> and saw the calamity?
[6:28:11] <Hidashi13> cat boy scalely
[6:28:16] <EsotericOdyssey> cid survived eight calamity battle royale world
[6:28:19] <+notgac> Cid Jr Jr Jr
[6:28:21] <BlueLunecy> Cid carries once again
[6:28:25] <Overloard> crystarium is CID's TIME SHip
[6:28:28] <%Typhaeon> He stole the idea from Nero Kappa
[6:28:28] <Zombrocom> TIME TRAVEL
[6:28:30] <+ragermister> why is Cid such a BADASS?
[6:28:30] <Hidashi13> Cid 21
[6:28:31] <Graxe_> Cid figured it out, but he couldn't make it
[6:28:36] <+Fynale> @AngriestPat he might've gotten some tips from alexanders mechinations
[6:28:46] <%NYCrownlessKing> ah yeah. guess he saw the future/
[6:28:51] <%NYCrownlessKing> of the source
[6:28:52] <SailingSaturn> Alexander would help cirThin
[6:28:54] <+Fynale> and there's time travel in the manderville stuff
[6:28:56] <SailingSaturn> cirThink
[6:28:57] <%Valdorick> Aw... Emet was mocking him.
[6:28:58] <+GARIIISH> Wasn't that what Emet said?
[6:29:07] <$NitronStreams> THEMING
[6:29:19] <allanmiri> Wasn't there a cutscene where your character appears all glowy before Cid and gives him his goggles? Maybe that was time travel.
[6:29:24] <%spiritofmojave> Lots of theming, Ardbert did it a lot too
[6:29:30] <$NitronStreams> its like poetry it rhymes
[6:29:36] <redial_nick> so he's red trunks
[6:30:12] <arkv01> I was kinda hoping the crystal exarch was a bunnyboy
[6:30:12] <SailingSaturn> less war more survival? cirThink
[6:30:16] <MasterDecoder> Wait, so this is happening as a continuous loop?
[6:30:17] <arkv01> the only one that you'll ever see
[6:30:21] <+lucaflow> He's actually Trunks
[6:30:22] <+superdoomshroom> I think was supposed to be more like a dark age
[6:30:23] <%spiritofmojave> Trunks with a sharingan eye
[6:30:37] <+lucaflow> Crytal cat Trunks
[6:30:40] <dekkitout> That long of a World War seems odd, unless they all have like long life spans or whatev
[6:30:41] <EsotericOdyssey> bet Nero helped cid
[6:30:46] <%NYCrownlessKing> he's the Capsule Exarch
[6:30:57] <%Yadogari> I cant believe Cid stole all of Nero's work

[6:31:22] <%harambi> bla
[6:31:24] <+Fynale> @cthulhamog you get out of here right now big spoilers are happening
[6:31:43] <BlueLunecy> This is even given Urianger a headache
[6:31:50] <Hidashi13> im so confused
[6:31:51] <BunnyEmperor> and thus Urianger learned the script
[6:31:51] <allanmiri> Shield thine eyes new guy
[6:31:56] <kaze7897> @cthulhamog Leave. Seriously. So many spoilers
[6:32:00] <+superdoomshroom> totally
[6:32:02] <+Fynale> "if history need be rewritten then let it be"
[6:32:21] <cthulhamog> @Fynale I APPRECIATE YOU FAM but I do not care even a little about spoilers. Going through it myself is the important bit
[6:32:39] <bear_breaker20> @Fynale thats gay tho
[6:32:40] <kaze7897> You really should. This is best going into blind
[6:33:01] <arkv01> this pee pee anno is wonderful
[6:33:06] <$NitronStreams> Oh man Warrior of Lights dick is SOOO BIG
[6:33:15] <Zombrocom> "Oh man player, you so cool and awesome wow you dick is so huge!"
[6:33:22] <%Gogogolem> The warrior of lights ocd keep him going.
[6:33:31] <%ssks123> WEEBS ARE DEAD
[6:33:31] <%Valdorick> "Oh man player, Murmphumphfur"
[6:33:33] <fehraf> His dick WAS THIS BIG
[6:33:39] <gekizenbu> Oh hey its Heavensward
[6:33:45] <+notgac> wow, pat's good at remembering
[6:33:47] <%Deft_Thought> Damn Pat, you're so heroic
[6:33:48] <BunnyEmperor> Dragonsong War
[6:33:49] <%Lapinelis> Dadmonts Fanfic saved the world
[6:33:53] <elisascarlet> so did edmont die in that future?
[6:33:54] <%harambi> apatCrazyhead
[6:33:55] <%NYCrownlessKing> ohhh so his books, hold the stories of the past..? aka our future?
[6:34:24] <%theturtlebar> It's interesting how something like WoW does its best to make sure the player character has minimal role in the central story, while ShB is making you as big dick important as possible.
[6:34:33] <%abakkus> catboy: u inspired us so much the player character: thanks i wanted a cool sword
[6:34:38] <EsotericOdyssey> "I can't NOT have his dick in my mouth" G'raha Tia talking about WoL
[6:34:41] <%Ranryu692> Go and bring the legend back to life
[6:34:49] <Hidashi13> so does dialog change if you choose a female character?
[6:34:55] <+Edrem> yes
[6:35:01] <jackythefrost> yes
[6:35:05] <%Lapinelis> The exarh has been cumming in his pants whenever he saw you come up to him
[6:35:08] <+lucaflow> So many people want to bone the WoL
[6:35:09] <jackythefrost> They say she/her instead
[6:35:11] <%NYCrownlessKing> exarch did say earlier he thought urianger looked like a trust worthy man @AngriestPat
[6:35:13] <%spiritofmojave> it changes the pronouns
[6:35:15] <+BloodyBurney> Note that the main theme may be from the perspective of these future people
[6:35:16] <+ItsYaGirlMaria> Urainger is a pro at lying
[6:35:25] <arkv01> incoming kissing
[6:35:27] <EsotericOdyssey> "I can't NOT suck them titties" G'raha Tia talking about (girl) WoL
[6:35:27] <+Fynale> it's cuz he was willing to lie during the warrior of darkness stuff
[6:35:36] <BunnyEmperor> Urianger is the smartest of the gang thats why
[6:35:41] <+GARIIISH> lmao
[6:35:44] <Dementedpenguin> LUL
[6:35:54] <%spiritofmojave> big chat japed

[6:36:02] <Zombrocom> I mean, if you skipped the cutscenes it would have been
[6:36:05] <TioXyco> he/she said 10 minutes, but not HOW MANY 10 minutes
[6:36:06] <SailingSaturn> cirPls
[6:36:09] <$NitronStreams> Never believe chat when it comes to time
[6:36:09] <Jolnir> maybe you have time after all
[6:36:09] <%Faustgesicht> Also no one would be able to understand you, you goddamn thesaurus.
[6:36:11] <allanmiri> This is a really long flashback. If it's all in real time then the MC is just standing there with a dzed look on thier face.
[6:36:19] <allanmiri> *dazed look
[6:36:25] <+notgac> just 4 10 minutes away
[6:36:34] <%Fatmanjoggin> Nah man, 10 minutes with time travel
[6:36:36] <+Edrem> The role quests actually point out that the hero does just stand there gazed the entire time lol
[6:36:39] <%spiritofmojave> time in chat is... convoluted
[6:36:42] <%Lapinelis> Dude I said like 40 from the start :p
[6:36:46] <EsotericOdyssey> ten jupiter minutes

[6:37:26] <%Lapinelis> Do note, there's about 7 hrs of stream left tomorrow. Plan accordingly
[6:37:27] <%Deft_Thought> I bet the Exarch had some regrets once he saw your hat
[6:37:34] <%Lapinelis> It is not "a little bit left"
[6:37:34] <+justianxix> This isn't really happy friend
[6:37:37] <GarbageQueenEllie> @bear_breaker20 Two words: cat dick
[6:37:41] <arkv01> guys stahp no sexy talk right now, its supposed to be a touching scene
[6:38:00] <%Gogogolem> Bitch slap ermet
[6:38:07] <+justianxix> LUL
[6:38:10] <%Valdorick> Emets a bitch, an amazing bitch
[6:38:12] <bear_breaker20> again: why knot, he passes the turing test
[6:38:13] <%abakkus> go stick ur foot up his ass
[6:38:16] <BunnyEmperor> appropriate answer
[6:38:20] <arkv01> that sexy bitch emet
[6:38:22] <EsotericOdyssey> when you see emet you will be ashamed of your words and deeds
[6:38:23] <GarbageQueenEllie> @arkv01 haha "touching"
[6:38:25] <Dragovus> Make that bitch your bitch you bastard!
[6:38:29] <allanmiri> Stomp emet in the nuts. stomp him in the nuts
[6:38:33] <Maverick2736> gotta go put a bullet up Emete's dong
[6:38:40] <Hidashi13> so the hero kisses catboi?
[6:38:42] <megaman_sentinel> that is a nice hat
[6:38:45] <redial_nick> just punch his mouth
[6:38:52] <+Estuko> if he can walk then he can CLEAN HIS FUCKING AXE
[6:38:52] <EsotericOdyssey> ASHAMED of your WORDS and DEEDS when you see emet
[6:38:53] <%Gogogolem> The warrior of light isn't really good at speeches but he gets the job done.
[6:38:57] <%Lapinelis> God I can't wait till you get to the final area.
[6:39:06] <+superdoomshroom> and then Ardbert can kick him in his ghost dock once he's dead
[6:39:08] <%Yadogari> I hope Ardbert gets his body back so he can clean his axe
[6:39:22] <%joylent_blue> something about pat going "cuz he a bitch" as his character solemnly walks out the door really got me LUL
[6:39:22] <+BloodyBurney> i feel like its another 15-20 min to last area, if you're wondering
[6:39:24] <%spiritofmojave> he can't clean the axe, it's ghost blood
[6:39:29] <Maverick2736> he likes his axe filthy so it does more damage
[6:39:35] <allanmiri> I just noticed Pat's pupper.
[6:39:36] <%Roundelay11> Not yet
[6:39:39] <+notgac> you have 3 more long cutscenes
[6:39:42] <%terminallyCapriciousz> Not quite!
[6:39:42] <%Lapinelis> There's one more longish cutscene until final zone time, pat.
[6:39:44] <%Gogogolem> @AngriestPat Pat you're still like 20 mins from that zone
[6:39:48] <%Roundelay11> It's like another 20 minutes of cutscene
[6:39:52] <%QuadraticGravity> It is NOT like 20 minutes
[6:39:55] <%demegodz> More lore!
[6:39:56] <%Lapinelis> And then figuring out how to get to the final zone
[6:39:59] <Jolnir> you have a few more long cutscenes
[6:40:07] <bear_breaker20> smoke break lol

[6:40:28] <GarbageQueenEllie> Pretty sure the canon WoL is just Pete Davidson's character
[6:40:28] <%QuadraticGravity> Most of chat hasn't even gotten there yet
[6:40:30] <Ion_Laser> He's got a condition
[6:40:32] <+ItsYaGirlMaria> why are people like "its only like 10 minutes, I didnt watch cutscenes though"
[6:40:35] <%Valdorick> Your hat will absorb the light and save you.

[6:41:54] <%Faustgesicht> This clerk is "What the fuck is this dinner theater shit?"
[6:41:57] <+superdoomshroom> I feel like the scions must be used to Urianger lying all the time by now

[6:56:39] <+sixcubit> they love revelry so probably
[6:56:39] <%sshen> Feo is straight up a girl, it's only the english VA doing the fucked up accent that confuses things
[6:56:41] <%NYCrownlessKing> Plague, will make it fuckable
[6:56:43] <%spiritofmojave> they can be coated in paint regardless of gender

[7:01:12] <%demegodz> @Gogogolem the hooded guy
[7:01:12] <+VashyronM> What's actually funny about this is that WoW's latest patch has content involving being on the ocean floor with water being open around it so you can walk around
[7:01:16] <aka_izala> music in this game is just too OP
[7:01:16] <+BloodyBurney> so was this anyone's expectation?
[7:01:18] <%TG_Cid11> not the last zone keep going

[7:01:52] <%1buckboom> 1buckboom subscribed with Twitch Prime. They've subscribed for 7 months, currently on a 2 month streak! 
[7:01:53] <Maverick2736> the difference is that FF14 does it well, whereas WoW has become flaming garbage by this point

[7:02:28] <KatabolicRage> just hit the first aetheryte and call it there

[7:05:55] <%BakedPretzels> BakedPretzels subscribed at Tier 1. They've subscribed for 5 months! Yo pat, as someone who plays no fighting games and has very little experience with jrpgs of any sort, where should I start with yakuza and which ones are non essential to play? Also tell paige I said hi.
[7:05:55] <%Gogogolem> Have you doom us all to die.
[7:06:05] <%Typhaeon> Hello Not-Sahagin

[7:06:06] <+blewbeary> Ah thanks @kiri_sute_gomen
[7:06:12] <%Lapinelis> Boy you ugly
[7:06:13] <EsotericOdyssey> 'this not-water is bad for my skin'
[7:06:15] <%Toast_Master_General> Thankfully these fish people can breath air too or else this would be big mass murder
[7:06:18] <%logoth_> why the close up of the fish man
[7:06:28] <Forester_Skippy> how the fuck are they fine? we literally too kall the water out of their city and they jsut dont give a fuck
[7:06:37] <Aristotlay> why no voices
[7:06:40] <BlacSoul> no
[7:06:42] <+VashyronM> Yeah, sorry. Not everyone in our group could be bothered to get the Kojin blessing
[7:06:44] <Seraphile> i think the sahagin models need a touch up
[7:06:47] <Aristotlay> I wanna hear gross fish people
[7:06:48] <%Faustgesicht> ... Leave
[7:07:00] <%logoth_> Those fish men probably sound like cobra commander
[7:07:01] <Pykeball> No gross fish people voice for you.
[7:07:05] <jackythefrost> Voice acting is expensive
[7:07:06] <BunnyEmperor> because you'd need to voice the lizard too
[7:07:10] <%weissguard> Bless you Paige.
[7:07:16] <%logoth_> no wait those fish men sound like Evilak
[7:07:17] <%joylent_blue> i thought Ryne sneezed there for a sec LUL
[7:07:20] <Pykeball> Have Paige voice the gross fish people since she does such a good gross fish lady voice.
[7:07:28] <Habblewater> Fish people voices would just be the sound of rotten fruit being thrown at the wall
[7:07:39] <Aristotlay> SPlOoRCh
