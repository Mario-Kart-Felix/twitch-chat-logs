[0:28:07] <NewWillinium> @SkyfireHero I will say that, contrary to many internet comments, that Skyrim is a good and fun game *completely* vanilla.  There's something magical about it that I really can't describe. And it doesn't help that there is **no** competition that does a similar kind of thing in the market.

[1:04:00] <tolloponik> that's three chloranthy rings fast
[1:04:04] <InXplotch> Oh, sprinting still uses stamina but rolling doesnt?

[1:05:06] <dan_g_v> huh
[1:05:07] <+anoldtoilet> @psimon_ it has weird hitboxes so you will get hit by stuff that looks like it misses a lot. also its kind of "unfair" designed more than oither souls games and explicitly tries to screw you over and trick you more

[1:05:35] <AlphaRayAllen> Just like cap?
[1:05:35] <%PrimalDweeb> That opens up a whole new way to play.
[1:05:36] <andrewoid_> @Bloomingzonda kick is a weapon art now, it's on bare fists by default
[1:05:36] <$MattyNezz> THE WALL
[1:05:36] <$AgentZombieMan1> @psimon_ If you’ve never played a DS game before, there’s nothing really wrong with 2. Almost all of the complaints about 2 are in comparison to 1 and 3
[1:05:37] <SneakyCorpse> Havel be salivating right about now
[1:05:38] <+gitgouda> you need to ask the more important question, can you guard counter with just a shield
[1:05:42] <$Dreadlord134> He is goofy
[1:05:42] <+Draegen_> Yooo - just joined the stream - PS5 or PC?
[1:05:47] <+Mrbaconator> THE WALL
[1:05:49] <Louie_Salmon> Jump attacks are still so crazy, I can't believe that's a thing I can do
[1:05:50] <+AceStrup> Kurt Cobain is back with the two handed shield psaDogchamp psaDogchamp psaDogchamp
[1:05:58] <ZE_Count> @Draegen_ ps5

[1:06:45] <%barrakuta371> dark souls2 you would for sure die
[1:06:46] <ape_hawk> stop using your cloak as toilet paper
[1:06:47] <%RayReborne> this cave looks amazing even with stream compression
[1:06:47] <%TheHateFish> @AgentZombieMan1 Kick is the special move for unarmed, from what I remember
[1:06:50] <rasamune> It's pretty crusty
[1:06:56] <+NordiqueJer> That sound design feels more bourne than souls tbh
[1:06:56] <ape_hawk> STOP WIPING YOUR ASS WITH YOUR CLOAK
[1:07:07] <$MattyNezz> Nailed it
[1:07:08] <+anoldtoilet> yeah and its not a front kick anymore

[1:08:47] <longtom21> don't hype over simple things imo
[1:08:48] <+Deekman> I hear they added those because americans hate the boss rush, hence the name. i'm vaatividya

[2:05:06] <+Javaa01> @handfulofslugs The way the game engine calculates fall damage isn't based on velocity, it's calculated off of fall time

[2:05:13] <+TubbsNK> HAHAHAHA! The idea of his character looking at a bird, thinking "birdie", and then walking off a cliff to his demise is hilarious to me.

[3:21:29] <cochramd1992> yeah seems to be doing way less damage than the longsword but maybe  it's because these guys are like stone
[3:21:29] <RinWR> Hit the >45 hitzones
[3:21:41] <Treasure_Vault> Two hand knoife for no bounce off? Does that still work?

[3:23:59] <PhistyMcNutz56> BLEED ACTIVATED
[3:23:59] <JawKneeMuzak> @zibbazabba905 Isn't that the more someone tries to invoke crazy talk the less likely it'll happen?
[3:24:01] <+anoldtoilet> yeah you  ened to spam attacks with dex weapons
[3:24:03] <Zeif00> it melted
[3:24:04] <+AceStrup> If only you had a spell that reduced fall damage lol

[3:24:15] <jtsoppy137> the bloodborn dogs monkaS
[3:24:17] <+poordoughboy> it bleed happen!

[3:24:22] <%PrimalDweeb> They made bleed useful? Cool.
[3:24:23] <AllenDeadman> they seem to be made of stone
[3:24:26] <causewaybob> Pup snuffed
[3:24:30] <%cowboy_plague_doctor> big bleeds
[3:24:32] <%Bloomingzonda> @X2Eliah Yeah Digital Foundary says they fucked up the DX12 optimization more than likely
[3:24:33] <%doc_ock_rokc> PUP SNUFFED
[3:24:40] <Tunamanguy> wow
[3:24:42] <%takotoots> wow
[3:24:43] <Hepathos87> They bleed now?!
[3:24:43] <RustyQuarters> Blood + Blood = More Blood
[3:24:45] <+logandabennett> logandabennett subscribed at Tier 1. They've subscribed for 2 months! Elder ring BBYYYYY
[3:24:51] <%cowboy_plague_doctor> nice
[3:24:58] <%furiousfurioso> the ranged move seems to build a lot more bleed
[3:24:58] <zenith0111> Thats badass
[3:25:05] <AllenDeadman> get a weapon skill for the shield then
[3:25:07] <%RayReborne> that would be RAD
[3:25:08] <%tusk102> bleed happen
[3:25:13] <+Jaromero435> can you take off the parry with that one item? or can you only add?
[3:25:15] <xavi_is_here> you're talking crazy Pat
[3:25:16] <%cowboy_plague_doctor> those were pretty good
[3:25:16] <%comradeiota> Does the knife have a thrust attack? Those guys might be weak to piercing since this looks like a big ol Stonefang
[3:25:19] <zenith0111> Dual wield?
[3:25:20] <HoboFlea> patches sold a shield that had weapon skill
[3:25:27] <toahmes> can you just take parry off?
[3:25:29] <%cowboy_plague_doctor> nailed it
[3:25:30] <iamnuff> That ranged attack looks like it inflicts bleed way faster than melee attacks
[3:25:32] <oda_flobunaga> @PatStaresAt the ash of war you want on your shield is "no skill" specifically
[3:25:34] <Treasure_Vault> Yeah, change shield to caestus for best parrys, you're right
[3:25:35] <%MagnusCoolman> pat has unlocked drive and overdrive for dagger
[3:25:35] <+FirstFireKeeper> can you take the skill off
[3:25:38] <%RealThiele> you need a shield that is actually a greatsword and not a shield
[3:25:43] <%logandabennett> I’m super conflicted to either get it on the XBSX or PS5
[3:25:49] <%cowboy_plague_doctor> rip
[3:25:50] <+poordoughboy> damn
[3:25:53] <%CavemanInCave> sick
[3:25:55] <%TurtlesAndTentacles> I want shield that let me throw like Captain America
[3:25:56] <z_mad_j> But weapon skill though
[3:25:59] <Hepathos87> meet the
[3:26:01] <xavi_is_here> pretty rock
[3:26:06] <+Jaromero435> sick knife
[3:26:07] <%X2Eliah> ps5 all the way
[3:26:10] <%Dakuu75> wait: buy the shitty shield, take the skill off, put it ont he good shield? is that possible?
[3:26:12] <genmypoweralready> Oh shit
[3:26:13] <zenith0111> @logandabennett The fact thats even a problem says a lot lol

[3:26:20] <LunarRemix> So weird that you're actually using a Knife and it's good.
[3:26:27] <%tusk102> @PatStaresAt if you buy patches shield cant you slot the skill onto your shield at a grace?
[3:26:29] <LunarRemix> Knives have been shit for so long in these games
[3:26:29] <+Asi9> Pat, you playing on PC? Digital Foundry just put out an article saying the PC version has crazy frame pacing and data streaming issues,

[3:27:06] <+FirstFireKeeper> @LunarRemix guessing you never used the bandits knife in 1 then
[3:27:07] <%Bloomingzonda> @logandabennett Digital Foundary said they are about the same except the only way to get constant 60 fps with it on any hardware is to use the PS4 version on the PS5
[3:27:09] <ThePowerOfRa420> Ps4 version on ps5 or no???

[4:18:21] <%Monkeyweed21> @PatStaresAt does this game still have Dark Souls' sound system where enemies aggro based on how loud your armor is?

[4:18:24] <PRchris13> !uptime
[4:18:24] <MonsieurHedge> pat hasnt used a chant yet
[4:18:24] <@Moobot> @PRchris13 I've been playing this game for how long? Oh only 4h 18m.
[4:18:24] <Omenaire_> maybe they use torches so they don't think much of it
[4:18:27] <Ioci95> Wowee
[4:18:30] <radiorosewater> SLURP
[4:18:32] <%Captainahab_37> wtf is this castlevania now
[4:18:40] <%RayReborne> funny enough triangle is the interact button in Horizon so i shouldnt have any trouble adjusting
[4:18:43] <%rumtumtugnutz> And you also have a kind that sys these trolls have ald headwounds, which is probably a hint that they're actually blind
[4:18:44] <%Brassnarwhal> @blastyoboots that's the anti piracy tech, if you pirate the game it turns your computer into a monkey

[4:19:12] <mar_krow> Uh oh
[4:19:13] <+queuecumber555> @patstaresat does the assassin spell let you sneak up on people while not crouched?
[4:19:14] <radiorosewater> Lone(?) Wolve(s)?
[4:19:19] <MavMedic81> You got beat up too
[4:19:21] <%Brassnarwhal> @monsieurhedge assassins approach which makes your footsteps silent, and urgent heal which is a small heal
[4:19:21] <koolkid1208> try  stealth
[4:19:22] <PRchris13> JUST a flash wound
[4:19:27] <brexdq> we found the giant rats that make all the rules
[4:19:42] <MonsieurHedge> oh, Approach would be really helpful in this cave i think
[4:19:43] <+GigaSeifer> if it bleeds
[4:19:45] <neonarcadia> if it bleeds...
[4:19:46] <+AnIrishPapaya> ooh dagger is the player, dagger is the play

[4:24:34] <%blastyoboots> Moss, veeheeheehee!
[4:24:41] <+Combatrobot423> This is great for weapons with back sheaths, which always clip terribly with capes. Now you can just take your cape off.

[4:29:36] <Gregorhasjoined> Good zoning tool for PVP. but DAMN that fp cost
[4:29:40] <The_Vainglory> What class is Pat playing?

[4:31:23] <+AnthraxJohnson> Burn the turtle
[4:31:25] <+izanagi22> Fast travel just being a thing still takes getting used to
[4:31:26] <LunarRemix> The Tree Sentinel?

[4:32:20] <%jaybombdotcom> jaybombdotcom subscribed at Tier 1. They've subscribed for 21 months! PC pr PS5
[4:32:20] <Guardiansaiyan> Now I want to watch Howls Moving Castle!
[4:32:20] <Gregorhasjoined> Butthole clenched a little
[4:32:21] <LunarRemix> Spells have really weird requirements in this game. Like some Faith spells require really high inteligence and vice versa

[4:32:34] <+FirstFireKeeper> @genmypoweralready and magic doesn't exist
[4:32:35] <rabbit_rader1> lol
[4:32:36] <deviljhojho_> nice fursuit
[4:32:36] <radiorosewater> this game on pc or just console exclusive?
[4:32:39] <+ReallyBigRocks> he HATES it
[4:32:40] <blackskulldragon18> Burn baby
[4:32:40] <ohno58> he no like fire
[4:32:41] <+CatRidder> it stagers
[4:32:47] <+Combatrobot423> Arcane seems to specifically be tied to dragon-related stuff. Dragon themed incantations and weapons all seem to require Arcane.
[4:32:50] <Gregorhasjoined> Eh...
[4:32:50] <deviljhojho_> you can get this game on anything but the switch brother
[4:32:56] <%blastyoboots> chug
[4:32:56] <Shygster> Is this on PS5?
[4:32:58] <ZE_Count> tht bleed is strong

[4:33:21] <TechnocoloredCat> desent
[4:33:27] <lyzejag> That dragussy breath is stanky
[4:33:30] <+skyshinecrusader> nice
[4:33:32] <+izanagi22> I don't like how it makes you stand still for so long though, that feels like a potential liability
[4:33:35] <TheNix> Only reason its iffy is because the dagger special move is so good
[4:33:37] <deviljhojho_> hey!
[4:33:38] <zenith0111> Oh yeah he gets like more breather(?)
[4:33:38] <%coward_man> how da bideo games?
[4:33:38] <%Monkeyweed21> its actually usable unlike DS3
[4:33:38] <%Brassnarwhal> i just launched monhun rise and got a textbox saying sunbreak is available, whats happening

[4:44:58] <+Combatrobot423> I feel like putting Tree Sentinel right here at the beginning is a great way to teach new players “hey, not every enemy is something to engage on sight”.

[4:46:06] <+adamisbarely3d> @sherndon226 yeah, I think this is the biggest QOL thing in the game. boss runs seem way shorter which means even really hard bosses will be easier to lab out
[4:46:11] <+Combatrobot423> I wonder if you can break his stance
[4:46:15] <+gitgouda> thats a powerful stand hes got. crazy talk.
[4:46:15] <+allups> seems so

[5:17:57] <jtsoppy137> monkaS
[5:18:07] <Omenaire_> lightning meadows
[5:18:26] <xxHungryxx> Since Pat basicly playing a faith character he could probably get the strong AF faith spell. Beastclaw or something

[6:08:24] <AllenDeadman> well makes sense
[6:08:26] <%mighty_max_t> psaCrazyhand psaCrazyhead
[6:08:26] <+jaytitan96> That rumbling sound is nuts
[6:08:26] <+mrjplays2k9> @PatStaresAt why are you dumping points into faith and not using anything that scales with faith?
[6:08:29] <+thecowpow> literally trying to bleed a stone lol
[6:08:30] <xavi_is_here> Patron needs another weapon
[6:08:32] <BumblyMako> @T
[6:08:33] <+ShaolinWanderer> its because you put no points into luck
[6:08:34] <GhostPyre> you just need to hit him 30 more times.
[6:08:35] <TechnocoloredCat> no burn or bleed
[6:08:36] <ArOne_Start> Can't get blood from a stone
[6:08:36] <iswearimjustdandy> @solidoutlaw thatd be a good reddit question in like a week
[6:08:39] <%GalacticLatte> @Charronia :>
[6:08:41] <evbites> @dan_g_v he needs to use the horse for giant
[6:08:47] <peachy996> You could picture this as a little baby Malus
[6:08:48] <+Fabpsi_> maybe greatsword
[6:08:50] <LunarRemix> @mrjplays2k9 He's only got 2 miracles and no Ash of War that scales with faith
[6:08:51] <+ShaolinWanderer> Pat just wants a zweihander lol
[6:08:55] <%Birdigalore> That day, Pat received a grim reminder...
[6:08:58] <President_Pariah> this is like BotW on Hard mode, just getting fucked in every direction D:
[6:09:11] <solidoutlaw> @iswearimjustdandy appreciate the response, I know it's early, I'll ask again when I get ready to grab it in like a week or 2
[6:09:13] <+thecowpow> is there slash/thrust/etc physical damage or is it all consolidated into physical damage now
[6:09:16] <+Fetrigon> business pat?
[6:09:22] <+ShaolinWanderer> @Birdigalore more like a GRRM reminder shaoli47KEKW shaoli47KEKW shaoli47KEKW
[6:09:32] <%Sirtimbob> Pats like “alright, what wants to kill me next?”
[6:09:33] <kingmemelord97> what i missed chat ?
[6:09:37] <+DiceDragonz> hey @PatStaresAt, endwalkers ost dropped yesterday, was wondering if you grabbed it
[6:09:37] <guffbud> Teleport?
[6:09:40] <+Deekman> what do the death stranding jellyfish do?
[6:09:41] <+johnny_scissors> They really fuck the faith build early huh. I imagine it'll get good as soon as he finds a wep for it though
[6:09:42] <+Fetrigon> > not business pat creepy49Bonk
[6:09:43] <dan_g_v> gotta focus on finding bonfires rather than go asnfar as possible?
[6:09:45] <%MikeyJC> @Birdigalore BOOOOOO
[6:09:48] <iswearimjustdandy> @solidoutlaw np! Sorry its not a definitive answer
[6:09:51] <+thecowpow> doggos!
[6:09:54] <funnyfunnykid> Did we ever find parts that screamed GRRM yet?
[6:09:54] <+gitgouda> this world dosnt seem so dysmal. is it not the heat death of the cosmos in this game as well?
[6:09:54] <+mrjplays2k9> @LunarRemix thats my point, maybe put the points into dex or arcane, which would actually improve the daggers damage
[6:09:57] <z_mad_j> Not alot
[6:10:02] <+Fetrigon> bring back business pat creepy49Rage creepy49Rage creepy49Rage creepy49Rage
[6:10:06] <critiquequartz> roughly how far into the game are you? like barely scratched the surface?

[6:31:55] <+ShaolinWanderer> you died
[6:31:58] <gespenst25> I really hate this part of dark souls 2.
[6:31:59] <%spitelite> this might be a come back later kind of place
[6:32:00] <@Spydurman> pro tip, hit and don't get hit
[6:32:01] <%holydeviant1> It's a secret . wav
[6:32:04] <%MartinOfLoxley> ESTUS

[6:32:10] <%rumtumtugnutz> No.
[6:32:15] <%ValHollaYoloson> Seems like a higher level area
[6:32:17] <%rumtumtugnutz> Just don;t get hit, you'll be fine
[6:32:18] <Shiibbae> “GO BACK”
[6:32:18] <%BallerSwagBro9k> Pro Tip: Dont Die
[6:32:21] <%MartinOfLoxley> Everything about this place is worse
[6:32:21] <+GigaSeifer> I think tiny bleed knife just isn't the best weapon, those guys seemed fine
[6:32:23] <+ajeanstarks78 > no bow huh?
[6:32:25] <@MistyMntns> Big Brain Time
[6:32:28] <%PrimalDweeb> BRAINS
[6:32:28] <+RandomMishaps> I don't get the fall damage
[6:32:34] <sonicblade38> anti bleed gear?
[6:32:35] <xavi_is_here> this game requires a lot of tackling areas first and others later
[6:32:38] <wolverinewaswrong> wheres the dark soul

[6:32:46] <CritScratch> overclock brain power

[6:34:12] <+Freakin_Wolfy> Anybody know how this performs on PC? I heard it had issues
[6:34:14] <%mighty_max_t> I think the enjoyment of discovery in this game is rivaling Bloodborne for me
[6:34:16] <%Monkeyweed21> its literally the estus effect with higher gamma and saturation
[6:34:29] <total_overkill> 6.5? Time for redbull
[6:34:32] <+tempestzephyr> yes, screaming
[6:34:37] <%PrimalDweeb> Indeed

[6:34:44] <%Dakuu75> I wonder if there are any spells or something that increase your running speed

[6:35:21] <+RedMaskBandit> yeah I cant wait to play it with the rest of the peasants
[6:35:21] <T_Sasquatch> Bleed knife hard carried this stream tho
[6:35:24] <%PrimalDweeb> True enough
[6:35:24] <sonicblade38> would blunt dmg work better on stone enemies?
[6:35:25] <Maids4lyfe> did Pat finally have a sword?
[6:35:27] <%ShinobiPhoenix> ok, does Dark Souls have FIST weapons? punching?
[6:35:32] <%Dakuu75> that's fine.

[6:37:04] <chowndawg> pretty sure you can
[6:37:05] <%ShinobiPhoenix> I suddenly want to use a Cetus speed build if that is possible
[6:37:06] <%Nervjc> I think that's a specific "I'm burning alive" death scream
[6:37:07] <+thecowpow> is this a no-death run?
[6:37:07] <taeko_ohnuki> @rumtumtugnutz I can't put my finger on what's bothering me, I'll leave it alone

[6:54:59] <+AnthraxJohnson> Summon your boys
[6:55:02] <+Double_Tap_That> Bleed that tree
[6:55:02] <scrumbotime> HIT IT IN THE Z-TARGETABLE UCLERS
[6:55:03] <%furiousfurioso> it looks like it has blood
[6:55:04] <+GigaSeifer> 「Stand Power」
[6:55:04] <Warstar696> Bleed the flame elemental tree? Seen weirder in Demon's Souls.
[6:55:05] <LunarRemix> It moves like a Bloodborne enemy on steroids

[6:55:10] <TechnocoloredCat> but maybe burn it x3
[6:55:10] <splatterstonechest> Hit it in the ulcers!
[6:55:11] <+Beetlewins> Pat stabbing a tree wondering why it isn't bleeding
[6:55:12] <%spitelite> its a tree so probably not
[6:55:12] <PunkZedB> doesn't seem weak to bleed
[6:55:15] <+ATorL> The One Reborn and Curse-Rotted Greatwood has a gross dragon-worm baby

[6:55:33] <%Brassnarwhal> these blocks are nutty
[6:55:33] <Warstar696> It clearly has ulcers, therefore it must have blood
[6:55:33] <%Monkeyweed21> Its ulcerated its already bleeding

[6:55:34] <Rbeatononefour> YYooooo

[6:55:36] <%NitronStreams> the secret is to attack it directly in the nutsack
[6:55:36] <+GigaSeifer> being able to block it flailing around is silly

[6:57:35] <PunkZedB> they helped for 5 seconds
[6:57:37] <%holydeviant1> It really seems like you can only apply bleed once. Might be wise to get the big gush then swap to a stronger traditional weapon.
[6:57:37] <thestoreemporium> why isthe health bar so small?
[6:57:40] <+ShaolinWanderer> you got this pat
[6:57:42] <SomeAsianDood> oh the boys do noooothing

[6:58:46] <Moguuera> command grab
[6:58:47] <xavi_is_here> this dumb worm thing doesnt even give you a chance to move
[6:58:48] <Warstar696> Eating a fiery shit straight out the gate? I'm starting to like this game.
[6:58:51] <thestoreemporium> @johnny_scissors yeah, just seems way too small. thanks!
[6:58:51] <CritScratch> yeah 4 secs sounds right

[6:59:27] <%Dakuu75> omg, thats right. you can jump over the tail-swipe... because we can jump now. fuck.
[6:59:28] <Warstar696> Doggos got dogged something horrible
[6:59:28] <CritScratch> poor doggos
[6:59:29] <$vehementvadr> very tight room for a thing the size of agheel
[6:59:29] <oda_flobunaga> @Freakin_Wolfy infinite Soldiers
[6:59:39] <ExpressNode> Cleared the room in a second
[6:59:40] <anne_arkie> all my wolves gone
[6:59:41] <digaogrunge> its super weak to fire
[6:59:42] <Giztech> found moving left and staying close was easier to fight him
[6:59:47] <@goose_attack_almanac> These are some generous hitboxes honestly
[6:59:50] <+mrjplays2k9> have you tried crafting some resin?
[6:59:51] <ElBuraindo> now this is a BOSS
[6:59:52] <TechnocoloredCat> he's so agile in this tight space
[6:59:58] <%doc_ock_rokc> ALL MY WOLVES ARE DEAD
[6:59:59] <+GigaSeifer> that applies to every souls boss
[7:00:03] <SilverRoddo> mikeliveGadgetHmm move the GLOW over to the boss and it will take you to the main menu.
[7:00:13] <+Saunt> would bleed work well on it?
[7:00:14] <CritScratch> run
[7:00:18] <Wobuzhidao> Really fair hitboxes, ain't no foot kills like Ludwig
[7:00:21] <+Saunt> get all that sap tapped
[7:00:22] <guffbud> What this stream has taught me is that I cannot buy this game or I will fail my university course because I won’t do any work

[7:00:34] <derekpwns> so this spirit just has ulcers? thats why its pissed?
[7:00:35] <Warstar696> A living, bleeding tree covered in ulcers that spits fire and attacks like a fucking Nile crocodile? Pinnacle of game design
[7:00:35] <Phassums> ouchie
[7:00:37] <$realm_forge> He’s a twisty turny boy isn’t he?
[7:00:37] <AllenDeadman> can we try the jellyfish?
[7:00:40] <%VictorVonLouche> Every 1/3 health it seems
[7:00:43] <%rosysyntax> weak to fire, weak spot on side looks like?
[7:00:45] <RinWR> HP threshold?
[7:00:48] <cheapdoc> Don't forget about the weapon arts, unless you want dragon
[7:00:49] <ZE_Count> is it fire or holy?
[7:00:50] <+ShaolinWanderer> pat JUST DROP YOUR SHIELD lollol
[7:00:54] <evbites> looks like the new trend with fromsoft is snake monsters

[7:01:34] <+AnthraxJohnson> Go for bleed once then sword it up?
[7:01:36] <CritScratch> really hard to get to
[7:01:37] <PunkZedB> if it bleeds it can still kill you super hard
[7:01:37] <Omenaire_> try killing it this time
[7:01:41] <+GigaSeifer> it's not like it's hard to get back here, you've got the run on lock

[7:03:58] <xxHungryxx> And then the big chariot rolls in too
[7:03:59] <Th47guy> Looks like he might have a head hotbox you can use to posture it.
[7:04:00] <MonsieurHedge> the way its COVERED IN BLOOD
[7:04:01] <zenith0111> @warstar696 Makes more sense

[7:04:14] <%discoinfierno> The way it hates being alive
[7:04:14] <peachy996> Seems more DS3 to me
[7:04:15] <%The_Protagonist> Cleric Tree
[7:04:16] <evbites> this makes blood starved look like asylum demon
[7:04:18] <%teh_Question> it's the DS3 lightning doggo too
[7:04:18] <%holydeviant1> It's like a horrible combo of Bloodstarved and Rom
[7:04:19] <Warstar696> @zenith0111 it's basically a Bloodborne boss that didn't make the final cut :v
[7:04:19] <%bundle_of_herbs> IT'S THE PUS OF MAN
[7:04:20] <Th47guy> oh yeah, head definitely has its own hotbox for damage.
[7:04:20] <ebrion> Moves like Gundyr's arm
[7:04:24] <Omenaire_> better than bloodborne
[7:04:26] <HoboFlea> This thing is gross as hell
[7:04:32] <+ajeanstarks78 > we have at bloodborne at home

[7:05:45] <Overloard> how are they lone wolves if there are 3 of them?!?
[7:05:48] <critiquequartz> Weird choice to add new bosses to the bb pc port
[7:05:51] <HR_Freud> it's like a crusty version of the ds3 black goo snakes
[7:05:51] <%PrimalDweeb> I think you mean, it's gonna take some luck
[7:05:51] <evbites> i think miyazaki is over his grossness rule there is no dignity anymore
[7:05:53] <Ipsenscastle> d20xFaith d20xFaith d20xFaith d20xFaith d20xFaith

[7:06:07] <+Beetlewins> damn that wolf went right for the face
[7:06:15] <Sunstalker> Bojack Horseman?
[7:06:21] <Warstar696> @mrtanaka111 don't let logic ask questions. Just enjoy the misery.
[7:06:29] <penitentpendant> @thesw1tch When Bloodborne is ported to the PC
[7:06:32] <Rbeatononefour> PFFFFT
[7:06:34] <T_Sasquatch> @thesw1tch when the switch can download ram
[7:06:36] <cheapdoc> That was not a lot of damage
[7:06:38] <+SimplyRandy> oh no that damage was not high enough lol
[7:06:39] <%delilah4you> Pat....that wasnt a lot of damage :X
[7:06:41] <%holydeviant1> Mildly underwhelming visceral there
[7:06:41] <%SABiscotti> Bleed was way moew
[7:06:43] <+ShaolinWanderer> Pat has achieved his 3rd tomoe
[7:06:43] <%VictorVonLouche> So that was not a lot lol
[7:06:45] <%SABiscotti> more*
[7:06:46] <radiorosewater> 381
[7:06:47] <%LorcaNomad> that did so little damage FeelsBadMan
[7:06:49] <+GigaSeifer> that was worse than just bleeding him
[7:06:49] <Warstar696> Poor doggos, they never stood a chance
[7:06:49] <+TheBigO75> Wait so poise is back?
[7:06:50] <Sunstalker> That was not a lot for a riposte
[7:06:51] <evbites> DAGGER
[7:06:54] <Moguuera> war of attrition
[7:06:54] <BlueBiscuitGT> bleed did more damage than that
[7:06:55] <seer0ftime> let him have this
[7:07:01] <%Archmortal> I miss bleed dagger
[7:07:01] <+WeLucklessJacks> Just do that move six more times Pat!
[7:07:02] <+PortableBoredom> How's Dark Souls 4 going
[7:07:03] <%VictorVonLouche> Bleed does seem to be more damage
[7:07:07] <%doc_ock_rokc> Almost Phase 2
[7:07:13] <+thesw1tch> @t_sasquatch you can listen to daft punk on the switch. i dont get what you're saying
[7:07:14] <%holydeviant1> Honestly it's more that the stance break is a HUGE FUCKING STUN
[7:07:16] <+spookycool> uh oh
[7:07:18] <@QueequegTheater> This feels like a Monster Hunter fight
[7:07:18] <+Gamingand808s> shoulve susanooed him in the face instead
[7:07:23] <%RayReborne> LUL
[7:07:26] <+jofrankii> LUL

[7:07:29] <Moguuera> those midir-ass explosions
[7:07:29] <zenith0111> monkaS
[7:07:34] <jumpyhugs> if there's a stat that makes riposte dmg go up, like BB, then my decision has been made
[7:07:34] <cheapdoc> I wonder if it has a phase 3
[7:07:37] <deviljhojho_> NEVER BACK DOWN
[7:07:37] <Warstar696> Now it's on fire. This is getting worse by the minute.
[7:07:39] <%The_Protagonist> psaDab psaOno
[7:07:40] <psimon_> 55 pog
[7:07:45] <guffbud> Would the lightning grease be good for this ?
[7:07:45] <@QueequegTheater> "Im a genius...OH NO"

[7:07:59] <+GigaSeifer> bleed seemed better
[7:07:59] <+RandomMishaps> Co-op?
[7:08:00] <%abakkus> gettin there tho
[7:08:00] <jumpyhugs> @deviljhojho_ OK, SOMETIMES BACK DOWN
[7:08:01] <%TurtlesAndTentacles> We getting there
[7:08:01] <%delilah4you> Its...
[7:08:02] <%slandracon> is the damage trade of the sword over the bleed worth it? @patstaresat
[7:08:03] <+jofrankii> that was a cool looking death ngl
[7:08:04] <@QueequegTheater> PFFT
[7:08:04] <Geoblood> could it also be weak to fire?
[7:08:05] <Cirren> D:
[7:08:06] <%delilah4you> too much...
[7:08:06] <MonsieurHedge> hes getting more consistent with each go
[7:08:06] <evbites> use dagger
[7:08:07] <+mrjplays2k9> def seem underleveled for this
[7:08:07] <yaboi_raidshadowlegends> D:
[7:08:09] <+Totally_Not_Toby> vod watchers skip 1 hour
[7:08:09] <%WackyGear> KO
[7:08:10] <heartlesshealer> F
[7:08:11] <derekpwns> roll frames seem generous in this game
[7:08:11] <zenith0111> ITEM BUFFS PAT
[7:08:12] <+Arnoldoaad1> LUL LUL
[7:08:15] <MonsieurHedge> soon he will become the Elden Lord
[7:08:17] <Moguuera> fire did a lot of damage earlier
[7:08:17] <digaogrunge> FIRE
[7:08:17] <Omenaire_> AOE
[7:08:17] <cimturry> next bit
[7:08:18] <T_Sasquatch> Its doable but it'll take a while
[7:08:18] <brunoberserk> Piccolo : DOOOOODGEEE
[7:08:19] <%SWFanatic> PastaRat Vs. Tree Worm
[7:08:19] <+wizard_of_diamonds> Everyone give Pat your energy VoHiYo
[7:08:21] <penitentpendant> So... Monster Hunter Rules on Status Effects?
[7:08:23] <%doc_ock_rokc> Thats how it works
[7:08:23] <%Monkeyweed21> You need to use an elemental weapon to survive Escaton Judgement
[7:08:23] <%Dakuu75> sounds like monster hunter rules.
[7:08:24] <AllenDeadman> that is how resistances work on bosses
[7:08:26] <$renyrells> just like real life
[7:08:28] <+sevorai> does the jump have iframe?
[7:08:30] <%OrangeMDT> Maybe you can roll through the explosion??
[7:08:30] <heartlesshealer> Can't defeat ulcers
[7:08:32] <%RayReborne> 8
[7:08:33] <%VictorVonLouche> Bleed then poise break?
[7:08:33] <%holydeviant1> Pop ONE bleed, do the stance break, then rely on normal damage?
[7:08:38] <+AnthraxJohnson> Can’t believe Pats at the final boss. John Elden Tree
[7:08:38] <+pabloelenano2> 11 for first bleed prock
[7:08:38] <%PrimalDweeb> Interesting, so you want to save bleed for the end?
[7:08:40] <$renyrells> maybe their running our of blood?
[7:08:41] <Sunstalker> See, those 5 hits with the dagger = 1 sword riposte
[7:08:46] <@QueequegTheater> @PatStaresAt I beat BL4 Mergo last night, just in time for Elden Ring. If I can learn to roll so can you
[7:08:48] <derekpwns> @PatStaresAt NRG
[7:08:52] <thestoreemporium> cant see shit
[7:08:52] <MrNoobMcSalt> did you ever try to blood blades weapon art on this guy?
[7:08:52] <+GigaSeifer> yeah but if you're cool, you can get the second bleed to push you way past his phase transition window
[7:08:53] <+Deekman> would it be worth doing the bleed projectile instead of face fucking it?
[7:08:55] <%Archmortal> Bleed also decays while it builds up if you aren't consistently hitting them
[7:09:02] <devanmuse> Pro-Tip: To beat the boss, just kill it until it dies
[7:09:04] <haitakaa> Pat using the classic Canadian technique of harvesting Maple Syrup
[7:09:11] <%delilah4you> Has he tried fire?
[7:09:11] <@Lion_kun> reminds me of a giant pus of man
[7:09:13] <cheapdoc> Waaaaaay more resistant
[7:09:19] <T_Sasquatch> Why you no use weapon art
[7:09:19] <Omenaire_> make the life bar go down
[7:09:19] <%delilah4you> Specifically the dragon
[7:09:23] <Warstar696> @haitakaa bleeding it slowly? I like that.
[7:09:23] <%rosysyntax> whoa that was HUGE damage, weak spot?
[7:09:24] <%VictorVonLouche> Back
[7:09:25] <psimon_> summon wolfs now?
[7:09:25] <+pabloelenano2> 15 hits for that bleed prock
[7:09:27] <+RandomMishaps> What?
[7:09:29] <+wizard_of_diamonds> Go Pat!
[7:09:30] <%RayReborne> then 16 or so
[7:09:30] <+sevorai> WEEEW
[7:09:32] <+GigaSeifer> see? halfway transition instead of 1/3rd if you just go ham on the bleed
[7:09:33] <@QueequegTheater> @rosysyntax Bleed
[7:09:33] <zenith0111> WINNABLE
[7:09:35] <Moguuera> @haitakaa every canadian has a cursed blood dagger for this
[7:09:37] <+wizard_of_diamonds> Oh no Pat!
[7:09:37] <guffbud> 7 hits to 15
[7:09:39] <+GigaSeifer> you go this
[7:09:44] <+mrjplays2k9> 540
[7:09:44] <+gitgouda> damn this is such a cool boss
[7:09:48] <Ipsenscastle> oof
[7:09:49] <penitentpendant> Trapped in corner
[7:09:49] <%RayReborne> bleed proc needs more and more hits as it procs
[7:09:51] <%Monkeyweed21> the bleed proc goes up by about 5 to 10 hits each time
[7:09:51] <CritScratch> walls
[7:09:53] <manateeworkshop> OOF
[7:09:53] <%Dakuu75> wow, that straight up is Rom
[7:09:54] <ZE_Count> wall
[7:09:55] <%Deft_Thought> This arena sucks
[7:09:56] <BaslerJones> so is this game really really really bad
[7:09:57] <cheapdoc> Room too small for big boss
[7:09:57] <Picia000123> cant see shit
[7:09:59] <AllenDeadman> yup
[7:09:59] <%RayReborne> nice way to balance it
[7:09:59] <+TheBigO75> lmao
[7:09:59] <+Beetlewins> wallfucked
[7:10:00] <mrtanaka111> pat becoming ulcerated
[7:10:02] <AllenDeadman> enclosed space
[7:10:03] <ebrion> Ugrade weapons?
[7:10:06] <+RandomMishaps> Co-op
[7:10:06] <zenith0111> Two hand the block?
[7:10:09] <UnsteadyFunk> The small arena makes this a nightmare
[7:10:09] <derekpwns> put on magic def sheild
[7:10:10] <AllenDeadman> jellyfish
[7:10:11] <zecht89> you blocked that earlier i think
[7:10:12] <CritScratch> brain time
[7:10:13] <Warstar696> @Dakuu75 Rom but in a tiny room with a lot more crazy shit going on.
[7:10:13] <+silvery_cricket> Jolly cooperation?
[7:10:14] <@QueequegTheater> Can you dodge through it?
[7:10:18] <+mrjplays2k9> resin
[7:10:19] <%TurtlesAndTentacles> Use Hammer lol
[7:10:22] <+Jaromero435> consumable item buff maybe?
[7:10:23] <Moguuera> try fire
[7:10:26] <+GigaSeifer> big Rom in tiny room
[7:10:28] <+sevorai> I think the golden fart gas bypasses the block
[7:10:29] <+pabloelenano2> how about reposts and posture for the fitst half and bleed for second?
[7:10:30] <%slandracon> @patstaresat so when you hit his arm specifically it seems to react seperate from the body, dont know what that means
[7:10:34] <+silvery_cricket> Pat's ego prevents him from jolly cooperating
[7:10:34] <jumpyhugs> Vacuous WatchRom of Farron
[7:10:36] <AllenDeadman> oh yeah, we could use fire resin
[7:10:37] <%Dakuu75> @Warstar696 so, chalice dungeon Rom but, worse. lol
[7:10:40] <HR_Freud> use the jump button
[7:10:44] <%holydeviant1> @QueequegTheater Keep in mind that there is a small delay and then a little firestorm effect, too
[7:10:45] <SilverRoddo> This monster trained it’s whole life to develop it’s brand of CQC
[7:10:47] <%Nervjc> If you can position to avoid the following geysers I think you can survive the initial explosion
[7:10:49] <%Archmortal> hard to tell if it has an actual AoE around the boss, all I can see are the Firestorm things on the ground
[7:10:56] <Moguuera> seems useful to keep this dude in the corner until phase 2
[7:10:57] <cheapdoc> He's starting to believe
[7:10:58] <%azacca_bitter> This looks a whole lot faster and action-y than DS
[7:11:04] <Warstar696> @Dakuu75 basically? Yeah. I tried Rom in a Chalice room ONCE. Don't need that kind of stress ever again.
[7:11:10] <derekpwns> @PatStaresAt use resin
[7:11:11] <+Beetlewins> You know, for a tree this thing is surprisingly agile
[7:11:14] <%holydeviant1> @Archmortal Body explosion + delayed firestorm
[7:11:15] <%RayReborne> dang super early
[7:11:16] <thestoreemporium> dude get more health
[7:11:19] <+Gamingand808s> KILL GIOLANTE PAT, YOU CAN DO IT
[7:11:20] <Gelphaze> Keep going!
[7:11:24] <Zineta> Damn
[7:11:26] <+AnthraxJohnson> Use the hammer and smash his balls
[7:11:27] <+GigaSeifer> but what if you get him? then it won't be a waste of resin
[7:11:28] <+Gamingand808s> BIOLANTE
[7:11:30] <pi_in_the_sci> but you can just craft more resin
[7:11:30] <%holydeviant1> What is it weak to? Poison?
[7:11:32] <+gitgouda> so can summons not be used in dungeons?
[7:11:32] <GankFrimes> for something that big it's surprisingly agile
[7:11:34] <+ProfessorMorrigan> Are you trying to do this underlevelled or something? That was one shot
[7:11:34] <HR_Freud> one of those fast trees
[7:11:36] <+GigaSeifer> I bet fire resin would be dope
[7:11:36] <%delilah4you> well at least i know i wont get spoiled by anything on this stream, it will just be another 6 hours of this fight :D
[7:11:36] <derekpwns> i did it
[7:11:37] <%epide> what do your other summons do?
[7:11:39] <luciluxlu0> thanks for the help. watching gave me advice I needed
[7:11:42] <Moguuera> hot hot heat
[7:11:42] <+Deekman> i wonder how much damage your torch would do
[7:11:42] <jumpyhugs> for a spirit, this thing is suprisingly tree
[7:11:44] <sonicblade38> i mean it sets it breathes fire, will fire work?
[7:11:46] <cheapdoc> Hey man, have you ever had an ulcer? not sure how it is moving so nimbly
[7:11:47] <pi_in_the_sci> it's made of wood, so fire seems reasonable
[7:11:48] <ElBuraindo> fire?...
[7:11:50] <AllenDeadman> fire grease with the broad sword after the firts bleed proc
[7:11:51] <AllenDeadman> first*

[7:12:36] <%fockniapo> world efficiency is going down the drain
[7:12:41] <MonsieurHedge> +20 per hit
[7:12:47] <splatterstonechest> The ulcers make it angrier
[7:12:47] <derekpwns> lot more
[7:12:50] <+GigaSeifer> the amount you'll have to hit him, that little bit helps
[7:12:53] <ArOne_Start> ironmouseDED
[7:12:54] <%The_Protagonist> that seems like a decent chunk more haha
[7:12:57] <psimon_> seems like a lot more
[7:12:59] <%OrangeMDT> Feels like you should get him down a little, then use resin & summons
[7:13:03] <KingKZ> I'm heading to work soon and I'm sure Pat will still be fighting this when I get back.
[7:13:04] <Moguuera> hit the fleshy bits
[7:13:09] <+GigaSeifer> as someone who's had ulcers, can confirm they make you this agile and angry

[7:13:10] <derekpwns> like 100%
[7:13:31] <jubejube56> It’s kinda like a big tree otter
[7:13:33] <namisrot> pat where is your cloak??
[7:13:37] <%Dakuu75> I like how fast paced this looks. Seems faster than Bloodborne, even.
[7:13:38] <+ChrisTheRedBeard> is there a way to hit those things on top of the ceiling? they look like they can fall and do damage
[7:13:39] <psimon_> wolfies?
[7:13:42] <%Shubreaker> Shubreaker subscribed at Tier 1. They've subscribed for 11 months! pog
[7:13:43] <+mrjplays2k9> this is like markedly more damage
[7:13:43] <Sunstalker> Almost twice asmuch as the riposte
[7:13:48] <Warstar696> @thesw1tch it already spits fire, so it obviously resists it's own bullshit.
[7:13:49] <+GigaSeifer> yeah he does it at about 1/3rd
[7:13:50] <%VictorVonLouche> 25 extra points it seems
[7:13:50] <MonsieurHedge> didnt you find a lightning grease in here? is that a hint he dislikes lightning?
[7:13:53] <derekpwns> ressin gone already dmn
[7:13:53] <SilverRoddo> Just throw a battery at it’s roots and come back in a few hours. 🔋

[7:14:08] <digaogrunge> It lasts for like a minute
[7:14:10] <%Shubreaker> this looks incredible
[7:14:13] <jumpyhugs> 360 tail no hope
[7:14:14] <LunarRemix> @Yhoryn Yes and it's like Dark Souls 1
[7:14:14] <derekpwns> cut the tail off
[7:14:15] <%PrimalDweeb> F
[7:14:16] <%RayReborne> BIG circle attack
[7:14:17] <+Beetlewins> the arena is honestly more dangerous than the boss
[7:14:18] <%cade_calrayn> jesus
[7:14:19] <AllenDeadman> almost 50%
[7:14:21] <%holydeviant1> At least it doesn't do a Smelter Demon
[7:14:22] <+Jaromero435> any other elements?
[7:14:23] <evbites> huh
[7:14:26] <ZE_Count> think its time to come back later Pat
[7:14:26] <%epide> i wonder what iframe gives you the low life save?
[7:14:29] <+silvery_cricket> Just summon help bro
[7:14:29] <cheapdoc> Cut the dick off
[7:14:29] <TonyBstreaming> So is this good for people not familiar with souls games?
[7:14:31] <MonsieurHedge> but if it does thatd be sick
[7:14:32] <%fockniapo> cut the tail and get a carve from it
[7:14:32] <graniteflier> how much would dragon breath do?
[7:14:33] <+GigaSeifer> if it has a tail you should cut it
[7:14:34] <DuckAlfred> Bruh, this looks sick
[7:14:37] <%epide> check your other summons
[7:14:41] <%holydeviant1> I mean, lightning smites the shit outta trees?
[7:14:41] <+Yhoryn> @LunarRemix Thank god. I was hoping it would be
[7:14:42] <%sandrews> maybe come back later after this try?
[7:14:43] <Heyestus> Get the boys out
[7:14:43] <thestoreemporium> git gud?
[7:14:45] <mrtanaka111> just kill it pat
[7:14:47] <zenith0111> wtf would a tree worm thing hate
[7:14:49] <+dandywaffles> Maybe try the fire and when that wears off go to bleed?
[7:14:50] <%RayReborne> pat it LOOKS rotted lol
[7:14:51] <Trigon_Trey> twist his dick
[7:14:53] <digaogrunge> This dungeon gave you 2 lightning grease @PatStaresAt
[7:14:55] <DickieWoodsmall_279> idk that guy looks like he lives for the rot
[7:14:55] <%discoinfierno> This games seems like it'd be real tough without a shield
[7:14:56] <+Alicitzen> Rot the tree
[7:14:58] <%Dakuu75> yeah, consumables
[7:15:00] <+silvery_cricket> Summon help dude
[7:15:01] <Warstar696> @zenith0111 EVERYthing.
[7:15:01] <peachy996> yeah just kill it already
[7:15:05] <derekpwns> cut the tail off this tree
[7:15:05] <%bundle_of_herbs> dragonrot probably helps against dragons like this
[7:15:11] <%kefkloud> you having a good time Pat??
[7:15:12] <cheapdoc> If anything it looks like you're doing less damage
[7:15:14] <Moguuera> never give up, skeleton
[7:15:21] <+ajeanstarks78 > 7 more hour until I get throw my soul at this thing
[7:15:21] <+GigaSeifer> use those items, beat those brain goblins

[7:28:29] <%holydeviant1> @BallerSwagBro9k tHAT THING is te last half hour
[7:28:30] <arkv01> what is max doing if hes not playing right now...?
[7:28:31] <+AnthraxJohnson> Ask Woolie. He’ll be down there in about 6 months.
[7:28:34] <Warstar696> @BallerSwagBro9k it's a tree-spirit with ulcers that seems to have infected a salamander. Don't question it
[7:28:35] <%RayReborne> max JUST stopped in the last 10 minutes lol
[7:28:35] <+GigaSeifer> whiffed
[7:28:49] <+johnny_scissors> I REALLY hope players can be summoned to multiple different summon spots because there are way too many dungeons for the traditional summon system to work well
[7:28:52] <+GigaSeifer> those rocks look like they could be a thing
[7:28:53] <%SWFanatic> this is like the opposite of shai hulud
[7:29:00] <%tentavision> looks like Max just got off lol
[7:29:04] <%BallerSwagBro9k> @warstar696 oh...oh...that sounds just wonderful WutFace
[7:29:09] <%OrangeMDT> Think you did the same amount of damage
[7:29:18] <ZE_Count> that pee really helped
[7:29:18] <Warstar696> @BallerSwagBro9k oh it gets WORSE too!
[7:29:20] <cheapdoc> You could still use the bleed for at least a part of the fight
[7:29:21] <oda_flobunaga> @AnthraxJohnson you give Woolie too much credit,   Paige plays faster than he does.
[7:29:24] <veltish> wonder if shooting those things hanging from the branches will make them fall and do damage
[7:29:26] <Pyon84> Yo Pat, good luck with this stick boss. It looks like a bitch.
[7:29:26] <Warstar696> @BallerSwagBro9k wait until phase 2.
[7:29:26] <%holydeviant1> TWO viscerals and it just doesn't seem worth
[7:29:35] <derekpwns> pat you got this
[7:29:39] <dan_g_v> Did he beat him? I heard somebody dying super hard and then silence!
[7:29:39] <athuramn> you did 70 more damage without the riposte
[7:29:42] <cheapdoc> Fair enough
[7:29:42] <%Dakuu75> would the dragon-fire do dmg?
[7:29:45] <%PrimalDweeb> Yes
[7:29:45] <%Sirtimbob> pat, use the SCRIMBLO
[7:29:47] <+GigaSeifer> it makes sense
[7:29:48] <+RandomMishaps> The audio sound horrible
[7:29:53] <+dkujawa24> whats this roguelike called?
[7:29:56] <+GigaSeifer> whether you can execute on the plan is a whole other thing
[7:29:59] <peachy996> Woolie and Paige are wildly opposite playstyle with their own set of pros and cons
[7:30:07] <%sandrews> is pat on PS5 or PC?
[7:30:10] <dan_g_v> don't use the scrimblo! He needs to save it for the blorgob!
[7:30:10] <derekpwns> @RandomMishaps good to me
[7:30:11] <+Tonicky > I like how this boss moves and also his look
[7:30:12] <%OrangeMDT> Genius

[7:30:20] <%PrimalDweeb> PS5 people
[7:30:29] <Warstar696> That fucking tail slap is beautiful
[7:30:30] <%sandrews> okay cool

[7:30:35] <%Dakuu75> YO BIG DAMAGE
[7:30:40] <%holydeviant1> SOLID DAMAGE
[7:30:42] <%RayReborne> NICE
[7:30:53] <+spookycool> that did more damage than the riposte
[7:30:53] <%holydeviant1> REALLY SOLID
[7:30:55] <Warstar696> CHUNK
[7:31:01] <AllenDeadman> it's not fire then
[7:31:01] <%RayReborne> its not fire then
[7:31:01] <%delilah4you> yeah its not fire
[7:31:04] <+ShaolinWanderer> @holydeviant1 knowing his DS luck the tree spirit will somehow kill itself lol
[7:31:04] <%doc_ock_rokc> ITS NOT FIRE
[7:31:06] <derekpwns> dosnt look like fire dmg
[7:31:07] <%holydeviant1> That heavy swing on the stun, that's good eating!
[7:31:08] <+GigaSeifer> it might not be fire that he's using, might be some other element
[7:31:12] <+RandomMishaps> @derekpwns It's sound like it's still rendering
[7:31:12] <dan_g_v> Remember to use Mountain Breaker slash to land the last hit or you get locked out of the golden ending, @patstaresat
[7:31:13] <%BallerSwagBro9k> MUSIC IS AMAZING
[7:31:14] <ZE_Count> its holy tree junk
[7:31:15] <%epide> WAIT WHEN HES DOWN LIKE THAT CAN YOU USE THE FIRE BREATH TO INCREASE THE DAM MORE
[7:31:16] <derekpwns> why would a tree do fire dmg
[7:31:17] <%PlaidisTheNewPlaid> Horizon Forbidden West when?
[7:31:17] <%SWFanatic> Poison Ivy got less sexy
[7:31:17] <evbites> @peachy996 woolie tries to find a way in and Paige just panics or kills the boss in 2 seconds
[7:31:18] <KaironFortressKnight> It must be that there gold fire, I tell ya what
[7:31:19] <+Beetlewins> looks like lightning tbh
[7:31:20] <%rosysyntax> it's gold like the Erd tree
[7:31:20] <AllenDeadman> jelly boi time?
[7:31:21] <Geoblood> that looks like holy element or lighting
[7:31:22] <Saltmeisterr> @PatStaresAt try dragon breath after posture break?

[7:36:14] <Augus7717> @PatStaresAt check the golden seed you got
[7:36:17] <dan_g_v> well, that was the easy mode secret dungeon
[7:36:18] <+johnny_scissors> Amd there's ANOTHER boss
[7:36:20] <$vehementvadr> pat did it, he beat big pharma
[7:36:21] <dan_g_v> feeling like a badass?
[7:36:22] <+MajorCrasher> LUL
[7:36:24] <AllenDeadman> still 10 HP huh?
[7:36:27] <%TurtlesAndTentacles> PAT DID IT?!
[7:36:29] <%punterxpunter> psaLiz
[7:36:32] <%LorcaNomad> Still going to come back later?
[7:36:36] <%holydeviant1> SO the winning strategy was to slap the head rather than stab it, then bleed it to fuck
[7:36:37] <%Dakuu75> So, he beat it at Level 21. ok, now we all have to compare ourselves to Pat
[7:36:38] <+johnny_scissors> @dan_g_v dungeon ain't over
[7:36:39] <+StallionPupper> i looked up a guide for that boss.. you were SUPER underleveled pat. lol  gg
[7:36:39] <Warstar696> @TurtlesAndTentacles he did it with style.
[7:36:43] <cheapdoc> Pat is creating THE ULTIMATE WIZARD

[7:41:33] <+mrjplays2k9> ded
[7:41:38] <%LorcaNomad> you could just grab and go
[7:41:38] <convo445> i'd use a different weapon on horse back
[7:41:39] <dan_g_v> you need jousting weapon for jousting
[7:41:39] <cochramd1992> "The caravan seems a little less extreme"
[7:41:39] <%Monkeyweed21> NUTS AT RISK
[7:41:41] <cochramd1992> DIES
[7:41:41] <%BallerSwagBro9k> biiiìiiiiiiiitch
[7:41:41] <athuramn> by a horse
[7:41:41] <%Birdigalore> Stomp it out and stomp it out and stomp it out
[7:41:41] <cheapdoc> @snugglepuggs His wrote his name down
[7:41:41] <outrogabriel> less extreme right
[7:41:42] <evbites> you need a lance or a spear
[7:41:43] <Maids4lyfe> less extreme?
[7:41:46] <+Them00n> You need to learn to joust bro, like actually @PatStaresAt
[7:41:47] <mrtanaka111> @snugglepuggs he made magical trees important for the lore
[7:41:48] <G_476> @snugglepuggs my understanding is that he wrote the backstory and that's it
[7:41:51] <%doc_ock_rokc> Based on the dialoge
[7:41:52] <+Fetrigon> yeah running straight into them is the problem.
[7:41:53] <%doc_ock_rokc> I think that
[7:41:54] <Picia000123> didn't you kill that tree?
[7:42:00] <+AnActualHermitCrab> @snugglepuggs He wrote some basic background details and then went back to not working on GoT.
[7:42:00] <+Havictos> @snugglepuggs He did the background lore I believe?
[7:42:02] <%slandracon> mounted bow?
[7:42:03] <derekpwns> sogEmotion extreme
[7:42:04] <Warstar696> That's actually quite correct in how war horses are trained to stomp fallen combatants.
[7:42:25] <%doc_ock_rokc> Poor horse
[7:42:25] <TechnocoloredCat> unite the trees o tarnished
[7:42:38] <TechnocoloredCat> to create the circle of life
[7:42:45] <w_khan> How the game so far?

[7:43:13] <peachy996> I hope somewhere out there George R.R Martin is burning potential drafts of the next Game of Thrones
[7:43:14] <TechnocoloredCat> lol
[7:43:16] <ArOne_Start> STOMP
[7:43:18] <%BackflipCharm> Aw man I just feel bad for these guys though

[8:05:02] <+akikyou> Reminds me of dancer of the boreal valley
[8:05:03] <%RealThiele> Bordt
[8:05:04] <TyphoonSwirl> BLOOD LOSS
[8:05:04] <%kyh9> It's just pronounced 'jail'
[8:05:04] <+Ryaotz> That is much more doable
[8:05:04] <%VictorVonLouche> Easy boss

[8:05:34] <toulon_somberjade> it's a Berserk
[8:05:40] <yaboi_raidshadowlegends> unless you have a really good pc
[8:05:45] <%greasypete00> im really hoping it plays ok on mine
[8:05:46] <%Monkeyweed21> @PatStaresAt did you read the patch notes
[8:05:46] <%kyh9> Is it because PS5 has the same number of GPU cores as the PS4 Pro???
[8:05:48] <%SUTTONSOMEGA> thank god i got the pc version then
[8:05:55] <Ipsenscastle> I thought Pat had a super quintuple ballin' PC
[8:05:55] <derekpwns> gym pat was a good arc
[8:05:58] <%kyh9> I really don't get why even the PC build is fucke
[8:05:58] <+Havictos> I don't have a ps5 so pc it was
[8:06:00] <%LorcaNomad> pat has a stupid good PC
[8:06:02] <+Ryaotz> Apparently PC version has issues
[8:06:03] <%AsHeadsIsTails> The requirements for this game are High
[8:06:03] <fatalDestiny> Ooof, good to know,
[8:06:04] <%comradeiota> I'm just at the minimum specs ...
[8:06:06] <@QueequegTheater> Pat's PC is perfectly calibrated
[8:06:06] <total_overkill> 3000 series seems to have alot of issues with new games
[8:06:07] <%RayReborne> well good for you Pat!
[8:06:09] <wolfen091> yeah, pc port not looking its best right now.
[8:06:11] <MrMoonGoose> That helmet looks so familiar
[8:06:12] <%comradeiota> hopefully... fine?
[8:06:12] <%Captainahab_37> oh its this guy from DS3
[8:06:12] <+yungkame> its direct x 12 from what i understand
[8:06:12] <AllenDeadman> does elden ring in PC have the same issue with the online as all the other souls games?
[8:06:15] <%RayReborne> im losing weight too
[8:06:16] <+Tucker0603> I hope it runs on minimum on my computer
[8:06:17] <+vicepresidentrichardhawk> well im glad that i got PC version
[8:06:18] <MayShip> would you say to wait on buying it on pc
[8:06:19] <%doc_ock_rokc> BEAST KNIGHTS
[8:06:20] <SomeAsianDood> wait that's just the dancer no?
[8:06:20] <radiorosewater> I'm gonna hold off on buying then, these games tend to be broken on PC
[8:06:22] <Ragnorok64> did you upgrade your CPU recently?
[8:06:24] <%SaiyanShoto> Pats PC is buff as fuck
[8:06:26] <nesbitt22> losing weight is still good
[8:06:30] <%greasypete00> @yungkame  pat has a 3080
[8:06:32] <+J4vierPY> so the 1 day patch didnt fix the fps?
[8:06:36] <masterfire23> there are stutters even with a 3090 locked at 60
[8:06:36] <+Totally_Not_Toby> the real question is why would you ever get a fromsoft game on pc at launch, they're always broken
[8:06:36] <42nfl19> Was that before video card drivers came out? For most AAA games they release drivers or something.
[8:06:40] <%chiazam> Oh wow did Pat upgrade the stamina reduction on block?
[8:06:42] <TheGreenFlannel> How's the game?
[8:06:44] <+Tucker0603> @mrmoongoose that kind of helm is called a houndskull
[8:06:47] <%azacca_bitter> it's a hella beef PC
[8:06:50] <%comradeiota> it's PC now or PS5 in like a decade when they become available
[8:06:53] <+mrjplays2k9> @PatStaresAt don't forget jumping has i-frames too
[8:06:53] <OrdinaryAverageGuys> I hope it performs ok on the last gen consoles
[8:06:54] <stevenellis386> that souls experience,am I right guys?
[8:07:06] <koolkid1208> I heard it might just be with 3000's cards
[8:07:12] <+yungkame> @greasypete00 oh i mean in that its the root of the issue
[8:07:12] <ChuckDMarmot> OBS is kind of a great big bag of dicks.
[8:07:13] <+EternalG07> He moves like Sekiro boss
[8:07:13] <%OrangeMDT> Half of his moves seem jumpable
[8:07:14] <+Namillus> OBS is just a massive memory hog
[8:07:16] <darce_avidson> ah
[8:07:18] <huskarl_zap> woolie gonna have a grand time
[8:07:19] <%holydeviant1> @OrdinaryAverageGuys same, I only have a ps4

[8:10:41] <Shardlab> Here's hoping it does work okay
[8:10:43] <%Monkeyweed21> The patch notes specifically mention fixing the random frame drops @PatStaresAt
[8:10:44] <+DiceDragonz> it would be nice on a ps5 if i could get one lol
[8:10:47] <+Stormzcales_Lair> PS4 non pro over PC seems like a naww
[8:10:48] <%RayReborne> still wish Console publishers allowed Steams 2 hour refund policy
[8:10:48] <+Renkaru> @total_overkill I just upgraded my CPU in 2020, it was the Ryzen 9 3900X
[8:10:51] <thatdudenamedlogan> Damn, this dude ain't fucking around
[8:10:51] <+Mrbaconator> i hope it's fucking playable
[8:10:57] <%kyh9> I'm crossing my fingers the Xbox version catches up to the PS5 version in performance.  Either by going back to DX11 or by figuring out how to use all the CUs
[8:10:58] <%Captainahab_37> i heard the patch made it worse
[8:10:59] <+mrjplays2k9> none of those were a sweep
[8:11:02] <42nfl19> @PatStaresAt do jumps give you i-Frames like rolls?
[8:11:03] <shotgang86> I got a RX 6600 XT come on how bad it can be
[8:11:08] <+hectorputrid> I mean i remember dark souls 3 having bullshit wrong with it when it launched and they  fixed it eventually
[8:11:08] <%TurtlesAndTentacles> can yall stop arguing with him
[8:11:08] <%Puhff> rip 3k runes
[8:11:11] <Pt_Kamen> Long-arm Centipede Giraffe also

[8:11:23] <convo445> i'll see what my 4 year old rig can do at 720p
[8:11:23] <%SaiyanShoto> People acting like Pat didn’t play it on PC already LUL LUL
[8:11:28] <%Captainahab_37> those look kinda like the demon's souls rock worm boys
[8:11:31] <derekpwns> i have a launch xbox one will it be good?
[8:11:35] <General_Terro> tech support andys LUL
[8:11:37] <Frostydough1> why are people trying to prove you wrong when you literally played it this morning? LUL
[8:11:38] <oda_flobunaga> Also, Streaming kills performance
[8:11:43] <Shardlab> So long as I can grab it on PS4, alright
[8:11:44] <heartlesshealer> Also it's too early in game lifetime for modders to make content for it on PC anyway
[8:11:45] <darce_avidson> norm ps4 ranges around 30 fps from what i hear
[8:11:48] <+dandywaffles> You called them souls
[8:11:49] <+mrjplays2k9> on ps4 its at least as good as bloodborne
[8:11:49] <darce_avidson> worst drops at 28
[8:11:50] <%SaiyanShoto> Pats got a beefy PC you think he wouldn’t have played it there first?
[8:11:55] <$OranHexthief> wasn't there a patch after you started
[8:11:56] <Byorski> FUCK HIM UP!
[8:11:56] <%Mister_McDerp> pc players can't handle the console version being better LUL
[8:11:57] <+pugszerosugar> What Pat is saying is Echoed by multiple “influencers”
[8:11:58] <%TurtlesAndTentacles> DarWeeWee Hunter of Wees

[8:13:21] <%Puhff> Wonder what these dudes did to get gaoled?
[8:13:24] <+Beetlewins> Dark Souls 3 on pc was awful until it was patched as well.
[8:13:24] <%Sirtimbob> Pat, when you die you click a menu option and go right back to where you died with your mini boss fight. Is that right?
[8:13:26] <Heyestus> Can you brin the boys out, or do the Gaols disable summons?
[8:13:27] <radiorosewater> is the whole pc vs console brand loyalty stuff still a thing people do?
[8:13:28] <%slandracon> resin run?
[8:13:28] <Zombrocom> Well, in my case, it's either play it on PC or don't play it at all

[8:26:31] <%rumtumtugnutz> As for how Pat's Mic doesn;t get TV noise, it's probably a combination of recording for room tone and using a good quality cardioid mic.
[8:26:34] <ZE_Count> that be a cool hat
[8:26:36] <+Beetlewins> That dragon, it had babies

[8:29:06] <Warstar696> There's NOWHERE that could be called "empty"

[8:29:08] <Mrscribbles> imagine if pokemon was this dense
[8:29:08] <+Grayhammatter> seems like it
[8:29:09] <luciluxlu0> hell I've been playing the game too

[8:29:15] <%RayReborne> its breath of the WILD BAYBEEEEEE
[8:29:17] <IminyourBase> missed a shiny sir
[8:29:19] <+marvinbrewton25> A filled open world game is actually hard to come by XD
[8:29:19] <$MandMGrease> What are these guys called, I wonder?
[8:29:22] <+RedMaskBandit> yeah
[8:29:22] <G_476> the one exception is the lake, I think, but it's also a huge boss arena so
[8:29:23] <+Grayhammatter> it's pretty jammed
[8:29:25] <TyphoonSwirl> isn't there at least 6 more zones like this too?
[8:29:26] <convo445> people will be discovering shit for literal years and years
[8:29:27] <xavi_is_here> this is how open world should be utilized, every few steps something cool to explore
[8:29:29] <TheDeimion> definitely looks like an openworld layout
[8:29:34] <cheapdoc> When there's so much
[8:29:35] <koolkid1208> The underground area as well!!
[8:29:35] <shotgang86> LUL

[8:29:47] <%chiazam> @PatStaresAt It's a Dark Souls level that spreads out in all directions
[8:29:48] <+RandomMishaps> @PatStaresAt I think you have barely done 3% of the game
[8:29:50] <+RedMaskBandit> almost yeah. you've been mostly dying and running back
[8:29:51] <%doc_ock_rokc> 5 min
[8:29:53] <TheDeimion> it's not as tight as I'm use to seeing but that's to be expected of being an openworld
[8:29:53] <+marvinbrewton25> NO even in breath of the wild it felt sorta empty at times this is just full of something all the time
[8:29:56] <+tempestzephyr> quick, protect them spiderman
[8:29:58] <42nfl19> @PatStaresAt so is there fall damage? or is more like, if you fall long enough THEN you die?

[9:00:55] <%tusk102> @PatStaresAt  what does the mighty shot you picked up do?
[9:00:56] <heartlesshealer> >:
[9:00:56] <%BackflipCharm> Uncalled for
[9:00:57] <%derpmandwn999> DON’T KILL TURTLE

[9:01:08] <+mrjplays2k9> @PatStaresAt you should have punted him like homer simpson
[9:01:12] <%WutangchickeN> Killing that tortoise means you won't be able to get the best ending in Elden Ring 2
[9:01:18] <heartlesshealer> at least they might all be on this hill
[9:01:18] <+Dommykins> killing the turtle gets the Evil Scrunglo ending
[9:01:25] <%tusk102> bow shot?
[9:01:29] <%doc_ock_rokc> Earth Shaker round
[9:01:45] <+Akizea> that a spell?
[9:01:53] <nertiaa> not the scrunky ending
[9:01:59] <feaxel> you can stop the scrungio ending by saving the wamabag
[9:02:07] <dan_g_v> boss time?
[9:02:08] <+Deekman> That’s the Master Shredder ending!
[9:02:09] <penitentpendant> Darkness
[9:02:18] <CritScratch> I dont know if that changes the ending but that poor turtle did nothing wrong
[9:02:18] <+landmammal> y'know just cult stuff
[9:02:19] <KaironFortressKnight> In all honesty though, Pat made it look easy. Shredder kinda sucks.
[9:02:21] <heartlesshealer> not the scrimblo ending, but the scrimblo bimblo donation message ending
[9:02:22] <dan_g_v> gravity power!
[9:02:23] <penitentpendant> That man is T-Posing! STOP HIM!

[9:06:52] <DestroPrime83> Owl?
[9:06:52] <CritScratch> owls are usually wise
[9:06:54] <+Moon_Tiger98> it's ok cause everyone knows all birds are drones
[9:06:59] <%Niney_Who> Owls are wise
[9:07:03] <%doc_ock_rokc> MR owl was about to tell everyone how many licks does it take to get to the tootsy roll center of a tootsy pop!

[9:07:18] <%WutangchickeN> The Turtle, Elmo, and Zangief, duh
[9:07:20] <zanzibarian_hamster> Owls are remarkably stupid actually
[9:07:20] <heartlesshealer> you saw a thing when you spawned... couldn't tell what it was
[9:07:21] <%Monkeyweed21> the tortoise seems like the freebie
[9:07:27] <%Dunsparcetheglare> Owls are wise animals pat
[9:07:28] <%TurtlesAndTentacles> Owls Deers and Turtles seem to be the idea imo or maybe even wolves?
[9:07:44] <%doc_ock_rokc> @WutangchickeN Zangief isn't a wise creature
[9:07:46] <+lawlessbacon794> is this harder than dark souls 3
[9:07:47] <%Monkeyweed21> so blind
[9:07:49] <%Dunsparcetheglare> you just killed one

[9:07:52] <+Beetlewins> well they're wise, so they're probably hiding from the murder man on the gorse
[9:07:54] <%Dunsparcetheglare> and found a second
[9:07:55] <%Deft_Thought> ... What if it means the whole map
[9:07:55] <%bundle_of_herbs> you just killed an owl

[9:17:16] <$EsotericOdyssey> it's a fuckin poltergeist
[9:17:17] <Heyestus> might be an idea to have the posse summon instead. more bodies means more mooks distracted.
[9:17:17] <@PrefectusCorgi> LUL
[9:17:17] <%tusk102> @PatStaresAt maybe wait to summon oleg till after the adds are dead?

[9:18:26] <%doc_ock_rokc> Yeah it seems you need a weapon of each type for this game
[9:18:28] <%OrangeMDT> Can you bleed it psaLol
[9:18:30] <%tusk102> @PatStaresAt mace bleeds too if the boss does bleed
[9:18:31] <+mrjplays2k9> bring more adds to battle adds
[9:18:54] <+Beetlewins> big hammer would crush harder
[9:18:54] <Jogsy29__> so i just did the resting on the tutorial, did they remove the two handing??
[9:18:56] <heartlesshealer> would the new shield help or is it weaker?
[9:18:59] <Jogsy29__> teting*
[9:19:05] <SomeAsianDood> ads vs ads PogChamp
[9:19:17] <%Monkeyweed21> What if the final ashes you unlock are your ashes and it gives you Doppleganger

[9:19:49] <jtsoppy137> dogoos down
[9:19:50] <rufus2k2> cool that the framerate ain't shitting itself with all them wolves on screen
[9:19:52] <Warstar696> Rest in peppers, puppers.
[9:19:54] <Jogsy29__> @T_Sasquatch which button is it? cuz its usually Y for me
[9:19:54] <feaxel> what if potion + oleg now
[9:19:54] <SomeAsianDood> Well there go your ads
[9:19:55] <CritScratch> doggos were better
[9:19:59] <%tusk102> can he still summon a different summon after the dogs die?
[9:19:59] <%sniffy77> i love how fucking weird it is
[9:20:01] <arduousScavenger> That flat jump really screws with the timing of the dodge.
[9:20:04] <heartlesshealer> bye puppos
[9:20:05] <rufus2k2> this is a very indiana jones and temple of doom design
[9:20:06] <Ipsenscastle> they way its heads wobble is really disturbing
[9:20:09] <jbrachob> I fucking love this weird ass gargoyle
[9:20:29] <%chiazam> Try Jumping?
[9:20:32] <%SWFanatic> try not getting hurt
[9:20:36] <T_Sasquatch> Has Pat backed down on any boss so far ? Seems like he's been able to get through everything for the most part
[9:20:38] <rufus2k2> are we gonna get a new form or attacks at 50%
[9:20:42] <%Wallabri> i love the way it moves it's so frickin weird
[9:20:47] <KasiCrafter> Parries ain't doing much?

[9:20:52] <Warstar696> @T_Sasquatch not that I've seen
[9:20:57] <%Ganerumo> haven't seen fromsoft design a boss this cool and creepy since demon's souls tbh
[9:21:00] <%doc_ock_rokc> It moves more animalistic as you damage it
[9:21:02] <sick315> what the hell is it even supposed to be
[9:21:09] <%greasypete00> the stutter is worse than I thought, it's like 24fps type of stuff and my PC is not weak
[9:21:14] <feaxel> what if jank made sense in teh lore?
[9:21:26] <T_Sasquatch> I really don't want to use a shield in this game LUL
[9:21:27] <jbrachob> It reminds me of some Hellboy demon from the comics
[9:21:36] <%bilyso> how is it on base ps4?
[9:21:38] <Jogsy29__> its true, those random stutters give me anxiety lol
[9:21:38] <%cowboy_plague_doctor> noice
[9:21:41] <+Boxcutterfly> BOSS DOWNLOADED

[9:22:29] <T_Sasquatch> Can't wait to see a full summoner build LUL
[9:22:32] <Jogsy29__> i have a rtx 2060 and it should be more than capable of handling it but boooyyy the stuttters can go from random to consistent
[9:22:35] <sick315> gg pat, now how weird can it get from here
[9:23:02] <Warstar696> @Jogsy29__ same here. Needs a fuckload of improvements
[9:23:16] <Gorgs7> must just be a compatability issue then
[9:23:19] <Heyestus> Japanese game has shit PC launch. Wonders never cease
[9:23:26] <$EsotericOdyssey> sounds like a "works/doesn't on my machine" sort of issue
[9:23:32] <+Sneaky_Catfish> judt joined chat, what stutters?
[9:23:40] <+NobuuNobuu> Im not in a rush to play it so might as well buy on pc and hope for a fix rather than buying on a base ps4
[9:23:45] <%basswizard11> I saw that people reviewing on 1.0 was minor, but became way wortse after the 1.02 patch
[9:23:46] <Warstar696> @Sneaky_Catfish Elden Ring on PC.

[9:24:34] <darce_avidson> are you gonna go to that massive castle in the south?
[9:24:36] <%rosysyntax> i assumed they would be in the immediate area
[9:24:41] <+Sneaky_Catfish> i have an rtx3070, would that be good enough?
[9:24:50] <+Beetlewins> that is literally a DS3 dog
[9:24:54] <darce_avidson> nah owls seem to be normal
[9:24:57] <heartlesshealer> owl or normal bird?
[9:25:02] <darce_avidson> i've counted more then three by this point
[9:25:12] <sick315> @Sneaky_Catfish it should be capable of running it on ultra but ya never know
[9:25:13] <+tempestzephyr> BibleThump

[9:25:16] <+Fetrigon> OMEGALUL
[9:25:17] <kirbykyodai> @Sneaky_Catfish yes but it's just generally borked on pc. pat has a 3080 and it was borked for him
[9:25:17] <%Mister_McDerp> they looked like falcons to me
[9:25:18] <%Monkeyweed21> @Sneaky_Catfish its not badly optimized, its just wildly inconsistent
[9:25:21] <+ReallyBigRocks> @Sneaky_Catfish should be, might get stuttering anyway
[9:25:23] <ZE_Count> poor bird
[9:25:26] <AluxDoesNotStream> Maybe it was just an unrelated magical glowing ghost turtle?
[9:25:31] <Warstar696> @Sneaky_Catfish technically... yes. But in reality, no.
[9:25:32] <@goose_attack_almanac> one more owl slain, once more does Stridents power grow
[9:25:43] <cochramd1992> well just get a third one, and see what happens when you bring 3 slumbering eggs to the statue
[9:25:48] <%chiazam> Pat don't jinx it
[9:25:55] <+jacksawjack> Owls are considered wise creatures
[9:26:01] <+Sneaky_Catfish> @kirbykyodai it did? wow...
[9:26:04] <+Beetlewins> you killed the turtle of peace and now you are locked in to the bad ending
[9:26:11] <%Mister_McDerp> those were falcons chat
