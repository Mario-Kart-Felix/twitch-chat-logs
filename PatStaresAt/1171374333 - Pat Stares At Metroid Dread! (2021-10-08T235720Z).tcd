[0:07:20] <%nichos7> I love it
[0:07:21] <BigFingerRo> Oh wow
[0:07:21] <%Monkeyweed21> Dark Souls of Castlevania
[0:07:21] <redwidow1358> Metroid Dread is fucking fantastic. It might actually be the best Metroid game hands down.
[0:07:22] <%Saadi90> it's awesome!
[0:07:23] <%ennui_on_me> They knocked it out of the fucking park
[0:07:24] <Mvrdok_> And imposible for some journos

[0:07:26] <koffeemancer> I heard it plays well
[0:07:26] <%GhoulishCripple> what little I've seen is amazing
[0:07:38] <%Dementedpenguin> I never went beyond or completed Super Metroid, so I can't really compare the games LUL
[0:07:39] <%polothegreatest> no money, but i know it slaps
[0:07:39] <deviljhojho_> is it really that good?
[0:07:39] <dd44dostivei> people should revisit super before saying that
[0:07:40] <BallerSwagBro9k> Dread deez nuts Kappa
[0:07:44] <Saltmeisterr> understandable
[0:07:47] <+king_of_beggars> Dread recaps the story of the games for nerds like you that never made the boat.
[0:07:47] <+healnavi> Samus Returns is mid don't worry
[0:07:49] <BigFingerRo> HE HATES IT
[0:07:49] <@Ranryu692> just emulate it
[0:07:49] <+ThunderZebraKing> A new metroid game that is actually good? do we...actually live in the best timeline?
[0:07:49] <%Monkeyweed21> fair enough
[0:07:49] <$ringabal> Could always blow through a playthrough
[0:07:50] <+TheBitingIrish> y?
[0:07:51] <%scaryboisupreme> Just emulate Samus Returns
[0:07:51] <Mvrdok_> Emulate it Kappa
[0:07:52] <greatspaceadventure> the vita would be a better system to play that on
[0:07:53] <+schmonker> can metroid crawl now?
[0:07:54] <%GhoulishCripple> Fusion would have been a good idea just because story
[0:07:54] <PanicSwytch> They should port samus returns
[0:07:54] <@ssjklyco> Just find an ASM2R rom
[0:07:56] <%AyotoCorp> Too bad there's no PC port of the 3DS
[0:07:57] <aeonicVector> Citra
[0:07:57] <+zegram250> emulation not n option?
[0:07:57] <%JD_Lars> JD_Lars subscribed at Tier 1. They've subscribed for 35 months! I read a book about Stockholm Syndrome. It started off badly, but by the end I really liked it. Thank you, money.
[0:07:57] <Aoworth> Stop you'll hurt its feelings
[0:07:58] <%nichos7> I still liked it
[0:07:59] <Tracazoid> Play the Gameboy version Kappa
[0:07:59] <%pilgrimsayswhat> Citra
[0:08:00] <%spitelite> im like 6 hours in and i would not say it is the best metroid
[0:08:00] <%patriotrenegade> Dogs can understand your words but you can‚Äôt understand dog words. Dogs are smarter than you.
[0:08:04] <Naraic101> Days suffering with Monster Hunter on the 3DS made me hate the system
[0:08:05] <+pectusumbra> Just play fusion you nerd-orb-goblin-man
[0:08:05] <%Monkeyweed21> TURN ON THE 3D TO SOLVE THIS STEREOSCOPE PUZZLE
[0:08:06] <%nichos7> But I am a huge Metroid mark
[0:08:06] <Rionxgarland> galatic patsu
[0:08:06] <redwidow1358> Even in emulation, Samus Returns is a bit janky
[0:08:07] <%scaryboisupreme> Citra runs it great and it's easy to map the controls
[0:08:09] <Zeppelee> Super is my favorite 2D Metroid, but Dread might be taking its place.
[0:08:12] <miucsa51> 3DS>VITA deal with ir
[0:08:14] <mike2hands> You hate your hands
[0:08:18] <%BoxNavy> more like metroid bread
[0:08:18] <+RedLanternReview> The 3DS legitimately killed that game lol
[0:08:19] <Aoworth> Yeah that shit happens when I don't sleep too
[0:08:20] <+D00msDayDan> man hyper light  drifter's so good i don't know why i dropped it right before the last boss
[0:08:20] <%SaphronBlackbourne> You can emulate it, I found a control config on Steam that takes care of the touch screen
[0:08:23] <%Ziegsy> souns about right
[0:08:26] <%edibleskeleton> pat is STINKY
[0:08:26] <JesusFromSpace> It's pretty much as good as Super Metroid. Maybe music is a bit lacking but still has some bangers @PatStaresAt
[0:08:30] <%bigboyeggo> is it just me or is pat quieter than usual?
[0:08:31] <%patriotrenegade> I wish it was cold where I am. It‚Äôs 88
[0:08:31] <iroh20> Listen I love all metroids but lets be honest, thats not a very hard title to acheive
[0:08:32] <Octocon> exhausted and not scared?
[0:08:32] <BallerSwagBro9k> Im playing it with a XBOX controller Kappa
[0:08:33] <Jontman42> sounds like it'll be an excellent stream
[0:08:37] <%blankwaffle> trooper pat continuing the stream
[0:08:39] <aeonicVector> but yeah Citra pat, citra
[0:08:39] <@Ranryu692> don't worry, we won't
[0:08:40] <%Ziegsy> I get super feverish when I lack sleeps
[0:08:41] <Aoworth> Fucked up how your body's regulations just falls to shit missing one night of sleep
[0:08:43] <%bigboyeggo> like i'm at max volume and even then he's a bit quiet
[0:08:47] <Naraic101> Baby Dread

[0:08:55] <Treasure_Vault> Is it? How would I play it?
[0:08:55] <greatspaceadventure> yes it is
[0:08:56] <%scaryboisupreme> PRIME 2 THE BEST
[0:08:57] <Mvrdok_> Yeah

[0:09:01] <greatspaceadventure> AND I HAVEN'T EVEN COMPLETED IT
[0:09:01] <redwidow1358> YES IT IS
[0:09:02] <mike2hands> He did the thing
[0:09:03] <%Monkeyweed21> ITS BUSTED HARD AT TIMES BUT YEA
[0:09:03] <jotabranded> nah
[0:09:05] <Tracazoid> Not wrong
[0:09:06] <jorniev> IT HAS WAY BETTER CAMERA CONTROLS
[0:09:06] <BallerSwagBro9k> Are u guys all ready for CHOZUSSY?
[0:09:06] <%scaryboisupreme> PRIME 2 HAS FUCKING QUADRAXIS
[0:09:06] <%RealThiele> emperor ing was a fantastic fight
[0:09:09] <+TaurusOxford> Prime 2 IS the best
[0:09:09] <marvel877> kinda, yeah.
[0:09:09] <+king_of_beggars> It is.
[0:09:10] <%SaphronBlackbourne> Prime 2 is my least favorite of the Trilogy lol
[0:09:10] <%GhoulishCripple> Da Baby metroid shot someone at Walmart
[0:09:11] <redwidow1358> PRIME 2 HAS PROBLEMS BUT IT'S AMAZING
[0:09:12] <vinnnyaraujo> PRIME 3 SUCKS
[0:09:12] <Zeppelee> Echoes is fucking GREAT.
[0:09:12] <%BoxNavy> no
[0:09:14] <jotabranded> the final boss is bullshit
[0:09:14] <Rionxgarland> i need to play the prime games
[0:09:15] <tanarath> hello pat
[0:09:15] <+D00msDayDan> unpopular opinion the metroid series is really an underrated hidden gem
[0:09:16] <+Delenay> prime 2 was my first metroid game and i think its the best
[0:09:16] <%Treuan> A little
[0:09:16] <greatspaceadventure> the entire trilogy just slaps tbh
[0:09:17] <gooner4654> not a spoiler remember to parry
[0:09:17] <+TheBitingIrish> I thought 3 was kinda lame
[0:09:18] <SunsetJack> No, 1 is still better.
[0:09:18] <aliasz50> it sure is
[0:09:19] <PanicSwytch> Nah
[0:09:19] <@ssjklyco> Metroid Prime 2 is when my thumb started to become damaged
[0:09:21] <%pilgrimsayswhat> nah you're fine
[0:09:21] <%RealThiele> Boost ball guardian is fuking hard
[0:09:21] <Jontman42> never played a metroid
[0:09:22] <Ravioli_Ronin> I just want them to port prime(s) to the switch
[0:09:22] <+JaxSolace> 2 IS the best one
[0:09:24] <+ReiDuran> DREAD REAL GOOD REAL REAL GOOD
[0:09:26] <+healnavi> Sanctuary's the best Prime area
[0:09:26] <koffeemancer> your fine?

[0:09:28] <%Monkeyweed21> some of those bosses are NOT TUNED but I still love em

[0:09:38] <+king_of_beggars> They need to give us the Prime Trilogy collection already.
[0:09:39] <tanarath> Prime 2 was better than 1,shame about 3
[0:09:44] <greatspaceadventure> Dread is very good so far but i'm not sure it's 9/10 like some are saying. granted only 5 hours in
[0:09:44] <%JD_Lars> Who talks about Prime 3 over 2?
[0:09:46] <+TheBitingIrish> I never finished 2 but I thought it was better than 1 and 3
[0:09:46] <%Treuan> Nice to meet you a loud man
[0:09:47] <%bob900000> one guy
[0:09:50] <mar_krow> I love 2 prime Metroid

[0:15:15] <%chance_h> Sir, I have seen enough mpreg diagrams to be an expert. The baby is stored in da balls
[0:15:17] <Chaossheep> I think we have to talk about mpreg all stream now
[0:15:17] <%ShinobiPhoenix> Devito was in Junior AND Twins
[0:15:17] <TheHeroAppears> devito is also in junior
[0:15:21] <+boki_86> @PatStaresAt DeVito is in the movie

[0:16:25] <%BoxNavy> even me
[0:16:29] <+healnavi> Griffith did nothing wrong though?
[0:16:29] <%nichos7> And yet the eventual message is to not revenge

[0:17:11] <+antpantz> WHAT?!
[0:17:12] <+boki_86> 10 - 13 hours
[0:17:13] <+ReiDuran> There's NO WAY you're going to beat Dread in 6 hours
[0:17:13] <%strakillias> Thats too much
[0:17:14] <%MechArch> why?
[0:17:14] <%s_xylocalsingles> how fucking broken is your lands Monopoly Money 92$ WHAT
[0:17:15] <%iHum4n> Sounds like a normal metroid length
[0:17:15] <hollumdusk> It CAN be 6 hours, but depends of the player
[0:17:16] <%MisterRockett> metroid games are super short.

[0:20:14] <%ShinobiPhoenix> this game is kind of intense
[0:20:16] <vinnnyaraujo> water theme is really good
[0:20:18] <hollumdusk> Other M with an actual control scheme would be a solid action game with bad story, but as it is, it has double the issues

[0:24:36] <%MidnightBurst12> not surprised, but oof
[0:24:37] <%ennui_on_me> Defending Chappelle right now requires the most impossible mental gymnastics
[0:24:38] <+ReiDuran> What the fuck? What? I haven't thought about Chapelle in over a decade WHAT?
[0:24:39] <%polothegreatest> big Ol  party
[0:24:39] <BarnYardFiddler> Chat gullible
[0:24:41] <a2guy> yeet
[0:24:47] <%ospreyworks> boy, comedians really don't want to let go of being transphoic and bigoted, huh
[0:24:49] <%ape_hawk> dave chappelle has been going down the boomer hole ever since his show ended
[0:24:49] <+BIumen> Pat is washing his hands of the topic
[0:24:50] <peyodogo> cool that you're decent that way though dude
[0:24:51] <Ape_Law> chapelle could have stayed in exile and retired a celebrated comedy genius
[0:24:52] <+GreyscaleDoes> @DatGuyJimbo someone whos anti trans
[0:24:56] <TourettesPlays> @Cherokia666 no it was like his entire special, literally hannah gadsbey  tier except the opposite side of the political spectrum
[0:24:57] <%Frranky> Frranky subscribed at Tier 1. 
[0:24:58] <%SaphronBlackbourne> @DatGuyJimbo transphobes
[0:25:01] <%captain_thickthighs> @keiganofastora a wank with honestly
[0:25:01] <@GeneralSCPatton> Man that sucks
[0:25:01] <churropoppa> he said he's a terf, defended jk rowling, and misgendered his personal trans friend that committed suicide.
[0:25:11] <@Spydurman> @DatGuyJimbo anti-trans, stands for "trans exclusionary radical feminist"
[0:25:11] <+farrellcityking> It‚Äôs bigoted to tell the truth
[0:25:14] <+DatGuyJimbo> I seeee
[0:25:15] <Ape_Law> but he had to come back and show his whole ass
[0:25:33] <OpenYourEels4TheNextFeels> @DatGuyJimbo Trans-Exclusory Radical Feminist. Transphobes who claim their transphobia is actually feminism
[0:25:34] <+BIumen> a delicate line
[0:25:38] <+ReiDuran> Well uh. My racist dad absolutely loved Chapelle show soooo....
[0:25:39] <%s_xylocalsingles> he became the old man he made fun of when he was younger
[0:25:46] <%captain_thickthighs> it's sucks but it's like he's a middle-aged man from Ohio I'm not surprised
[0:25:48] <%Fooguwu> Dude minorities are usually the worst of all to other minorities. it's fucked up
[0:25:50] <%chance_h> Unfortunately the black community has historically been antigay and trans rights with black trans people having an extremely high murder rate
[0:25:51] <%Agami23> he apparently really like JK rowling
[0:25:53] <%polothegreatest> Grand Wizard skit LUL
[0:25:54] <TourettesPlays> Allegedly Bill Burr laughed too hard at a racial sketch and it caused Chapelle to experience ego death
[0:25:55] <%BoxNavy> moon2W
[0:25:55] <@Spydurman> dude became the villain
[0:25:56] <%baka_sugoi> oooh Chapelle, I like the last special
[0:25:56] <Zeppelee> Can we not talk about this while playing a video game, please?
[0:25:56] <TheGuesty> RIP Charlie Murphy
[0:25:59] <+JonathLP> He got rich and started punching down
[0:26:03] <@Spydurman> he would be making jokes about himself
[0:26:07] <+farrellcityking> That you HEAR‚Ä¶ you have to judge for youreelf
[0:26:08] <Archmortal> Chapelle was always a misogynist fuckwit, he's just expanded how open he is about the other bullshit now
[0:26:14] <+healnavi> so nothing changed :V
[0:26:15] <+farrellcityking> yourself*
[0:26:16] <%ape_hawk> @Zeppelee pat's stream, pat's discussion
[0:26:18] <BarnYardFiddler> Punching down? He makes fun of everyone

[0:26:21] <+senfood> That's incredibly disappointing.
[0:26:21] <%MidnightBurst12> yep
[0:26:21] <%ennui_on_me> So many comedians who have not grown as people since the early 00s when this stuff could go uncriticized
[0:26:22] <BallerSwagBro9k> That's why I just watch Jim Gaffigan  Wholesome and funny
[0:26:22] <%baka_sugoi> Comedy is to made to poke things

[0:26:31] <+infinite_rotation> Oh shit is dread actually out  already or is this just a new trailer or something?

[0:26:33] <dd44dostivei> yeah but he's rich now
[0:26:33] <TourettesPlays> Chapelle quit because a white camera operator laughed really hard when he said the N word
[0:26:36] <%polothegreatest> HEY BABYY..
[0:26:38] <%Monkeyweed21> he was worried about racism, so he switched to Transphobia

[0:30:03] <%Frranky> should have had a little more fear
[0:30:05] <%scaryboisupreme> That's just Zero Mission
[0:30:06] <+healnavi> fuck waypoints
[0:30:06] <BigFingerRo> @s_xylocalsingles that'd be like paying yourself
[0:30:08] <%ennui_on_me> Oh my brain is so bad at this game but I love it
[0:30:08] <miucsa51> goblins
[0:30:10] <+fetrigon> oof
[0:30:14] <%scaryboisupreme> Zero Mission tells you were to go all the time
[0:30:16] <%Bluwizard21> no some of that shit is confusing to just intuit
[0:30:17] <Tracazoid> Tip: Never stop shooting or bombing stuff
[0:30:17] <+LastHazzerd> i'd kill the game if it told me where to go
[0:30:18] <@ssjklyco> Weird as metroid vanias are pretty easy to find where to go
[0:30:19] <+pectusumbra> Okay real talk ITS JUST METROID ITS NOT A METROIDVANIA
[0:30:21] <buddhistmetal> zero mission has the waypoint thing EZ
[0:30:22] <+bassforte123> It's the curse that if they do put in way points, Adam would be telling you where to go again and they don't wanna touch that
[0:30:23] <+LastHazzerd> Fusion was not fun to play
[0:30:24] <Tham1k> Everything is lies
[0:30:25] <KasiCrafter> Walls are SUGGESTIONS
[0:30:26] <%ahomeschooldropout> Is Control a Metroidvania?
[0:30:26] <TallGuyWithAHoodie> BUT IF I CAN'T TRUST WALLS WHO DO I TRUST PAT
[0:30:29] <%BoxNavy> not even your wall
[0:30:32] <marvel877> Most people just randomly shoot the walls in every room of Metroid games.
[0:30:32] <toulon_somberjade> Not even the one behind you?
[0:30:34] <%megadblitz> break every wall you see no matter what
[0:30:35] <@Ranryu692> speaking of lies, I have cake
[0:30:35] <OpenYourEels4TheNextFeels> wouldn't waypoints entirely defeat the purpose of the genre?
[0:30:41] <%chance_h> I got lost so many times play Hollow Knight‚Ä¶ almost cried too
[0:30:43] <%HaroldDonchee> watch out for wall metroids

[0:30:45] <+TheBitingIrish> Man, FUCK Bungie.
[0:30:45] <%ShinobiPhoenix> Zeldas and Metroids helped make the generation of OCDs
[0:30:46] <+DJAllblue> isnt metroid not just a metroid game without the vania?
[0:30:46] <@OfficioPrefectusCorgi> I thought  I softlock myself in that area
[0:30:49] <Cobaltor_252> oh here we go
[0:30:50] <%solracc25> walls are suggestions
[0:30:52] <%edibleskeleton> Destiny 2 removed entire PLANETS
[0:30:54] <Cobaltor_252> D2 talk from Pat yay
[0:30:55] <%bassoontyphoon> The baby?
[0:30:55] <AoiRob> and the breakables are block based so you gotta trust no square
[0:30:56] <%Bailey__Gaming> This Game is great love it so much
[0:30:58] <TheDr0t> @PatStaresAt what was that 5D chess shooter called?
[0:31:00] <TallGuyWithAHoodie> @GeneralSCPatton Shit, you right
[0:31:00] <%ShinobiPhoenix> and Paranoids, walls are lies
[0:31:02] <marvel877> The real lies are the few fake walls in save rooms.
[0:31:05] <$realm_forge> Currently playing Circle of the Moon can confirm walls are lies
[0:31:09] <DEMETRIDON> @PatStaresAt just wanted to say that i drove 16 hours from Toronto to St John, NB and wanted to say the Quebec stretch was terrible all the way through!
[0:31:10] <Morsuzado> you still gotta sniff chocobos
[0:31:12] <+TheBobulus> I haven't played meteor since fusion. what'd I miss?
[0:31:12] <scrumbotime> "Removed"

[0:31:41] <%Profmcstevie> Kairi KH1 is her best design, short hair
[0:31:41] <@ssjklyco> That trailer sucked. Look at me, I'm flying around.
[0:31:42] <%moink1234> No problem pat
[0:31:43] <+RedLanternReview> No wall left unshot, no floor left unbombed
[0:31:45] <%chance_h> Whoa, @s_xylocalsingles managed to gift Paige a sub
[0:31:47] <+RandyFistburgers> gotem
[0:31:49] <%Agami23> also kairi got a spin off game where she gets thrown away and replaced with sora again
[0:31:49] <%Cozy90> Kappa
[0:31:49] <%ape_hawk> kairi hurts more because she's been in several games but only like ten mins of screentime
[0:31:50] <%megadblitz> thanks moink!
[0:31:50] <albret__einstrong> @DEMETRIDON Welcome to Saint John, it stinks here enjoy your stay
[0:31:55] <%MugenSandan> actually I feel her KH1 design is the only decent one tbh
[0:31:59] <%cvp5127> namine > kairi
[0:32:00] <%twistedj3ster> ...pe-...penussy
[0:32:02] <%KeiganOfAstora> Why wasn't she subbed in the first placE?
[0:32:03] <%baka_sugoi> PLOY
[0:32:03] <+JustToWatch> TIME FOR METRUSSY
[0:32:04] <%GhoulishCripple> TBF Xion is like literally a PART of Sora in a weird "clone of his Soulless body's new soul" type of way
[0:32:04] <LoneFonte> this was also the last big expansion before the season pass stuff
[0:32:09] <olaksi> my favorite kh moment is when sora is super awkard like "oh hey, whatever" when he' reunited with kairi, and breaks down crying about riku a minute later
[0:32:09] <majindusto> PLOY
[0:32:13] <+TheBitingIrish> MATRIDS
[0:32:13] <%BoxNavy> yeah
[0:32:15] <+megaman_sentinel> what accent is that
[0:32:16] <%solracc25> Xion has a keyblade and a game, Kairi barely has a playable scene
[0:32:16] <%BoxNavy> do it
[0:32:17] <majindusto> PLER
[0:32:19] <+SpoopySkeletman> @PatStaresAt what metroid games have you played?

[0:32:39] <BigFingerRo> Oh wow that's a dramatic intro
[0:32:42] <+ThunderZebraKing> Other M was a metroid game?
[0:32:43] <+ReiDuran> whyyyyyyyyyyyy.

[0:32:48] <Tracazoid> Great pick to get back into it
[0:32:48] <Saltmeisterr> catJam
[0:32:49] <%ShinobiPhoenix> OtherM isn't really one though or a Metroid
[0:32:49] <%JoshManVGH> yeesh
[0:32:49] <scarman125> well that game was trash
[0:32:50] <i_chevalier> @profmcstevie it makes me sad
[0:32:52] <%HaroldDonchee> metroid prime kinda freaked me out as a kid
[0:32:52] <tanarath> Oh no.

[0:32:58] <%KeiganOfAstora> I like that it's the Metroid Prime music
[0:32:58] <BlueSpartan119> @polothegreatest yeah after that new leak the 6 month delay makes perfect sense now
[0:32:58] <%nichos7> Does it fill you with dread?
[0:32:59] <%SaphronBlackbourne> Other M is not 2D lol
[0:33:01] <%Monkeyweed21> all you need to know is that the Federation are stupid idiots
[0:33:03] <KasiCrafter> Wow, this Dead Space reboot looks lit
[0:33:04] <PanicSwytch> Intro has a huge lore dump
[0:33:04] <mike2hands> BWOOOOOOOAAAAAAAAWWWW

[0:33:09] <%polothegreatest> FrankerZ
[0:33:09] <tanarath> Pat, just play the ds metriods
[0:33:09] <greatspaceadventure> this game is going a little out of its way to make up for Other M
[0:33:10] <redwidow1358> This game is pretty harsh so far

[0:42:01] <hassanico2> 15 missiles neat
[0:42:01] <%ShinobiPhoenix> you get missiles back easy
[0:42:02] <%coffeeabomination> coffeeabomination subscribed at Tier 1. They've subscribed for 34 months! 
[0:42:02] <%captain_thickthighs> I love you you can see a bit of doom influences in that background art
[0:42:04] <%blastyoboots> Pat Stares at Mind Goblins
[0:42:06] <Brandon__Brando> oh I thought it was 3d
[0:42:07] <%therustystream> pew pew
[0:42:08] <bippityjones> Yes that button, you're going to get missiles like crazy
[0:42:10] <grimm_hatter> did the whole metroid thing with samus ever get resolved
[0:42:10] <tanarath> YES THAT BUTTON
[0:42:10] <%Monkeyweed21> super metroid was almost 20 years ago
[0:42:11] <toulon_somberjade> Chozo stole my wallet
[0:42:13] <+TheBobulus> can you charge?
[0:42:14] <%coffeeabomination> !uptime
[0:42:15] <%sandrews> like how long had Goblin king been playing?
[0:42:15] <peachy996> What did you think of Fusion's controls or did you never touch it?
[0:42:15] <@Moobot> @coffeeabomination I've been playing this game for how long? Oh only 42m 24s.
[0:42:15] <StarMechV> a counter
[0:42:15] <Frankenshop> I really wish the first thing I saw when tuning in wasn't a cutscene and some jagoff calling Samus "Lady"
[0:42:16] <liammichealryan> It's parry
[0:42:16] <olaksi> nothing is actually extinct, not even chozo
[0:42:16] <OneThousandTomatoes> i have a guess but I wont share
[0:42:16] <Saltmeisterr> yep
[0:42:18] <%blastyoboots> Melee COUNTER
[0:42:18] <%Agami23> yeah thats from samus returns
[0:42:20] <StarMechV> from Samus Returns
[0:42:20] <SlangPunk> Samus was raised by the birds, so it makes sense there‚Äôd be a couple out there still
[0:42:20] <%JoshManVGH> @goraka91 Bird Ridley? what like some kinda... Bird-ly?
[0:42:20] <brachydios777> Counter
[0:42:21] <toulon_somberjade> from Samus Returns
[0:42:21] <buddhistmetal> it's a parry
[0:42:21] <%Raikouija> @patstaresat its a big deal it was thought these prothean  like birds were EXTINCT
[0:42:23] <hassanico2> Parry button Kappa
[0:42:23] <artificiallynatural> it's like a parry
[0:42:24] <%polothegreatest> op button
[0:42:24] <AoiRob> eh. enemies drop so many refills you'll never really run out
[0:42:24] <%nichos7> From the Samus Returns remake, yeah
[0:42:24] <LoneFonte> IT IS
[0:42:24] <@GeneralSCPatton> If you 100% Samus Returns, it reveals this guy and a faction of anti-science Chozo that killed the rest of them.
[0:42:24] <Saltmeisterr> introduce in samus returns
[0:42:25] <liammichealryan> A parry*
[0:42:26] <%Monkeyweed21> parry
[0:42:26] <OpenYourEels4TheNextFeels> Samus Returns had some lore collectibles that foreshadowed that guy
[0:42:27] <%Bailey__Gaming> Parry
[0:42:27] <Kaji04> Can you charge and melee?
[0:42:28] <%Bluwizard21> @PatStaresAt Melee is very important
[0:42:28] <%Deft_Thought> The melee is from the remake
[0:42:30] <%asgard147> So I just go here, was that a fuckin' chozo?!
[0:42:30] <%IronOhki> Pat Likes It!
[0:42:30] <%ShinobiPhoenix> she has a melee counter since Samus Returns, but it's way better now
[0:42:31] <%twistedj3ster> shinespark tho
[0:42:32] <OldManDeckardCain> it's like pat was full of shit LUL
[0:42:33] <robosqueeb> why the chozo make Samus go crazy and shoot everywhere
[0:42:33] <OneThousandTomatoes> nice animations
[0:42:36] <albret__einstrong> Pat, do NOT goblin hoard missiles they are handed out like candy
[0:42:36] <+infinite_rotation> It‚Äôs a parry
[0:42:37] <peachy996> It's def very snappy so that's good
[0:42:38] <%IronOhki> Missile Door?
[0:42:40] <%baka_sugoi> YET
[0:42:42] <%ShinobiPhoenix> you can do a running or jumping parry
[0:42:42] <ohno778> fast shootan
[0:42:44] <Goraka91> @JoshManVGH To be fair, it's a very high IQ reference
[0:42:44] <%solracc25> no tips
[0:42:44] <tanarath> Missile, pat
[0:42:45] <+senfood> No charge yet?
[0:42:46] <Sigma_190_Beta> @PatStaresAt The Melee is a parry.
[0:42:48] <brandt_connors> yeah Super Metroid is a bit floaty
[0:42:52] <reonome> its a parry pat
[0:42:55] <BigFingerRo> OH SHIT A PUNCH
[0:42:56] <Officialchourico> Glad they finally gave Samus from Smash her own game
[0:42:57] <%ShinobiPhoenix> I just discovered if you do a sliding parry, it's a FLASH KIC
[0:42:58] <VritraReiRei> @PatStaresAt sorry i cant watch the stream cause spoilers but hope you have a FANTASTIC time with the game!
[0:43:00] <$OfficerMods> melee is also a melee now
[0:43:02] <$OfficerMods> if you run
[0:43:02] <scarman125> it's a parry
[0:43:03] <StarMechV> IT's a parry not a melee pat
[0:43:04] <Kaji04> huh, missiles from the start?
[0:43:05] <$OfficerMods> she does a srk
[0:43:08] <$OfficerMods> its great
[0:43:11] <%captain_thickthighs> That's a Perry not a melee
[0:43:11] <+ALazo> I already found a bunch of reviews saying the game is too hard and basically mad 'cause bad
[0:43:12] <OneThousandTomatoes> animal monkaS
[0:43:12] <%ShinobiPhoenix> SOMURSAWLT
[0:43:13] <%Nobody404> he did it... metroid can crawl...
[0:43:14] <+Saggitori> why can't metroid crawl
[0:43:14] <%baka_sugoi> DANCING SAM
[0:43:15] <peachy996> Do a Spin!
[0:43:15] <+SpaciousWheat> So i like Super Metroid....but it is the one good metroid game with archaic jank
[0:43:16] <DomunDomunDomun> Metroid can crawl!
[0:43:18] <AoiRob> @PatStaresAt it's reverse-bloodborne. the melee is a parry
[0:43:19] <%Bailey__Gaming> slide good
[0:43:20] <Goraka91> PogChamp Metroid is back?
[0:43:21] <+ArCielArDor> looks like your melee might be a counter
[0:43:26] <Yakobro> @PatStaresAt IT WAS REAL
[0:43:32] <dynamic_funk> So hows the game? kinda want it
[0:43:35] <toulon_somberjade> how does wall jumping feel?
[0:43:37] <%ShinobiPhoenix> it's a parry, but if you use the Dash Melee, it's OFFENSIVE instead of jjsut parry
[0:43:37] <+LastHazzerd> oh nice job on the wall jumping so soon
[0:43:40] <VritraReiRei> @captain_thickthighs the Platypus? ü§î
[0:43:41] <+SpaciousWheat> tbh every 2d metroid has a problem in some fashion
[0:43:44] <+D00msDayDan> the way this moves reminds me of that "there's something about metroid" animation
[0:43:47] <$OfficerMods> wall jumping is better than ever
[0:43:48] <liammichealryan> Been playing it all day, it's great
[0:43:49] <$OfficerMods> it just works
[0:43:53] <ElenaManetta> Was that a ledge grab?
[0:43:54] <$OfficerMods> no werid timing like super
[0:43:54] <%ShinobiPhoenix> and the dash melee gets very useful
[0:43:56] <%Fooguwu> chozoese
[0:43:56] <%shiplord13> @PatStaresAt So do you feel that this is a good Metroid game to tide fans over until Metroid Prime 4
[0:44:00] <albret__einstrong> @PatStaresAt , do NOT goblin hoard missiles they are handed out like candy
[0:44:07] <+SpaciousWheat> Super is archaic and jank Zero Mission is on a gba fusion is on a gba and is unrelenting as fuck
[0:44:09] <LoneFonte> @ElenaManetta yep
[0:44:10] <%solracc25> free
[0:44:16] <%extradopeness> its GREAT isn't it
[0:44:16] <%twistedj3ster> FIST that staue
[0:44:19] <BigFingerRo> @Fooguwu Is that Cunoesse's cousin?
[0:44:21] <jotabranded> this samus armor is the sickest one
[0:44:26] <%Dementedpenguin> @ALazo after what happened with Cuphead I'm not surprised anymore.
[0:44:27] <$OfficerMods> her suit is lighter so she can grab edges
[0:44:28] <greatspaceadventure> i don't get how you enjoy RE's tank controls but somehow Super's floaty jankness turns you off, since it's the same sort of thing kinda
[0:44:29] <%JoshManVGH> Toggle would be nice though
[0:44:30] <$OfficerMods> thats lore
[0:44:32] <$OfficerMods> look it up
[0:44:32] <Kaji04> ight, imma play this by myself, have fun
[0:44:34] <%TheLemuroid> They literally teach you that wall are lies
[0:44:42] <%Monkeyweed21> E is health
[0:44:43] <%ShinobiPhoenix> warning though, Samus since Fusion has like NO defense early on
[0:44:43] <Saltmeisterr> ah fuck
[0:44:44] <%moink1234> ALIEN
[0:44:47] <OneThousandTomatoes> jack in
[0:44:50] <KasiCrafter> Please. Please shut up ASAM
[0:44:52] <brachydios777> It makes sense that the chozo would have the arm canon since Samus' suit is chozo tech
[0:44:53] <+SpaciousWheat> I feel like the Prime games captured whats great about Metroid without being jank as fuck
[0:44:54] <+TaurusOxford> yeah
[0:44:55] <@OfficioPrefectusCorgi> Yes
[0:44:56] <%Agami23> yup
[0:44:56] <Saltmeisterr> ye
[0:44:57] <delerim001> YEP
[0:44:58] <tmvct1> not clear
[0:44:58] <hollumdusk> Seemingly
[0:44:58] <@ssjklyco> yes
[0:44:58] <%ShinobiPhoenix> Yes
[0:44:59] <%JoshManVGH> Yep
[0:44:59] <%Maids4lyfe> yes
[0:44:59] <+TaurusOxford> the sinew-y stuff
[0:45:00] <bippityjones> I guess
[0:45:00] <StarMechV> Its whats left of the Fusion suit
[0:45:01] <%solracc25> maybe
[0:45:01] <Zebroneath> yes
[0:45:02] <%silvery_cricket> The suit is made of flesh yes
[0:45:04] <hollumdusk> Is not 100% confirmed
[0:45:04] <%asgard147> seem so
[0:45:06] <+ALazo> Legion
[0:45:06] <%polothegreatest> nice
[0:45:06] <%nichos7> She's still got the Fusion in her, yeah
[0:45:06] <+LastHazzerd> yeah, exposed organic stuff
[0:45:07] <DSD24> Wow Samus you already messed up
[0:45:07] <%Agami23> the fleshy sinew
[0:45:07] <+Immortalsblade> Yeah, the suit is partly organic
[0:45:09] <%cvp5127> "you got owned"
[0:45:09] <+TheBitingIrish> I know Other M is a mess story-wise, but is the gameplay any good?
[0:45:10] <%twistedj3ster> hi EDI
[0:45:10] <peachy996> HE SOUNDS SO GOOD
[0:45:12] <+healnavi> ORB
[0:45:12] <%Agami23> thats the suit
[0:45:12] <DeltaD36> chozo
[0:45:13] <cellaccount> data
[0:45:14] <%JoshManVGH> She is permanently stuck in her bitchin armor
[0:45:14] <%ShinobiPhoenix> Suit is regrowing
[0:45:16] <%valriot> Yeah shes basically loaded up on Metroid DNA, and then Chozo armour
[0:45:16] <+LazyLuca> yeah her armor is part biological
[0:45:16] <peachy996> I LOVE HIM
[0:45:16] <albret__einstrong> Can she get out of the armor anymore?
[0:45:16] <@OfficioPrefectusCorgi> yes
[0:45:16] <delerim001> that is new
[0:45:17] <+pectusumbra> It's Guyver rules
[0:45:18] <Saltmeisterr> @PatStaresAt its her suit reverting pack
[0:45:18] <%solracc25> shhhhhh
[0:45:18] <%moink1234> organic flesh is blue
[0:45:19] <kinkade_77> the armor fused
[0:45:19] <+bassforte123> Yeah it looks like she put some of her old armor back on
[0:45:19] <@ssjklyco> Her suit
[0:45:20] <Parapattern> Biomechanical
[0:45:21] <jotabranded> it' grows like a organism
[0:45:21] <%ShinobiPhoenix> it's a living metal
[0:45:22] <%baka_sugoi> woolieLORE
[0:45:23] <+LastHazzerd> armor suit
[0:45:24] <jorniev> green shit is the fusion armor but not sctuch to her body?
[0:45:24] <Explodincatz> just play Fusion
[0:45:24] <tmvct1> she got a new varia at the end of fushion
[0:45:25] <Saltmeisterr> back*
[0:45:25] <Calek> @TheBitingIrish it's ok
[0:45:25] <+RedLanternReview> Yeah the power suit is partly organic
[0:45:25] <tanarath> Could be? Samus' suit is nanotech bullshit
[0:45:26] <%A_Mighty_Walrus> suit is regenerating
[0:45:26] <brachydios777> its a mix
[0:45:26] <+healnavi> it's regenerating
[0:45:27] <+Immortalsblade> The armour is growing back
[0:45:27] <miucsa51> yes
[0:45:28] <%Bluwizard21> @PatStaresAt It's kind of explained as the story goes
[0:45:29] <%ShinobiPhoenix> YES, Guyver rules
[0:45:29] <+senfood> She has a lot of weird shit in her suit. Just roll with it.
[0:45:29] <+TaurusOxford> After Fusion, the suit is starting to evolve back to normal @PatStaresAt
[0:45:29] <+LazyLuca> it's impled her suit is regenerating slowly after fusion
[0:45:30] <%Maids4lyfe> it regrows the metal itself
[0:45:30] <AoiRob> maybe NANOMACHINES?
[0:45:31] <%Nobody404> And yet all of it is magic that materializes when she wants it to
[0:45:32] <%captain_thickthighs> Don't worry It'll explain it
[0:45:32] <hollumdusk> It a bio armor, even the metallic looking parts
[0:45:32] <TheQuadrupleS> Suit is literally growing back
[0:45:33] <%Monkeyweed21> She got the plates they peeled off back from SA-X @PatStaresAt
[0:45:34] <DomunDomunDomun> Samus's suit is basically a kamen rider henshin.
[0:45:35] <%Bailey__Gaming> jam your Arm into the h0le
[0:45:36] <$OfficerMods> samus techincally is half bird half woman half power armor
[0:45:37] <%sirisvirus> end of fusion your old suit combined with the new one
[0:45:38] <%sandrews> I'm going to assume only the red is non-bio
[0:45:39] <%SaphronBlackbourne> The mechanical parts of her suit are regeneration, it's what the white is
[0:45:40] <ElenaManetta> This square animation reminds me of a toy
[0:45:40] <redwidow1358> The suit is self-repairing, but it takes time/forced repair
[0:45:40] <olaksi> oh no norted
[0:45:42] <%Dommykins> This happens to Samus a lot.
[0:45:44] <%Maids4lyfe> chozo armor is part organic part nanomachine
[0:45:44] <$OfficerMods> she is the suit in a way
[0:45:44] <%rDAKODAc> The armor is regenerating
[0:45:46] <%moink1234> this bitch is a parasite i just know it
[0:45:47] <%ShinobiPhoenix> the Power Suit was always biomechanical
[0:45:48] <$OfficerMods> also half metroid
[0:45:49] <augustustamerlane> Varia suit is built into her anyways.
[0:45:49] <miucsa51> it's a living metal
[0:45:50] <Totalabyss> dramatic, sammus is not a guy confirmed
[0:45:50] <+pectusumbra> basically it's partly molded to her. parts of her suit were cut off in fusion
[0:45:50] <reonome> how convenient
[0:45:50] <BallerSwagBro9k> AGAIN LUL

[0:45:59] <%abelincoln_catpuncher> physical amnesia gtfo lmao
[0:45:59] <%solracc25> Oh noo
[0:45:59] <A_Classy_Gentleman> FYI she's not stuck in the suit, that's a misinterpretation of a line from fusion.
[0:46:01] <dd44dostivei> they know
[0:46:01] <@ssjklyco> "Oops, I tripped"
[0:46:01] <Tracazoid> Not again again again
[0:46:01] <peachy996> Look how cold and robotic he is.
[0:46:02] <+Archphronimos> WHO COULD HAVE FORESEEN THIS?
[0:46:02] <+SpoopySkeletman> good old metroid syndrome

[0:46:08] <%sirisvirus> better then dropping them down a vent
[0:46:08] <StarMechV> CHOZO VIRGIL LETS GO
[0:46:09] <%extradopeness> this is EXACTLY how i imagined adam to sound
[0:46:10] <Goraka91> I do like how in the cutscene with bird vergil, Samus actually put up a fucking fight
[0:46:11] <ElenaManetta> Why don't they just start uploading her memory to a computer like in Nier at this point
[0:46:11] <$realm_forge> EVERY TIME SAMUS
[0:46:11] <%GustauveVIII> BAGS OF SPILLING? IN A METROID GAME? HOLY SHIT WHAT A SURPRISE
[0:46:13] <%baka_sugoi> sbfpSetIn
[0:46:14] <%ShinobiPhoenix> bio inplies the suit is alive
[0:46:16] <miucsa51> Damnit samus
[0:46:16] <+cermo55> at least this reason makes sense, getting owned
[0:46:16] <AoiRob> well at least this time she got her ass super kicked by birdgil so its ok
[0:46:26] <AxelCezar> there goes samus losing her memories again!
[0:46:27] <cellaccount> do a samus roll
[0:46:31] <$OfficerMods> ha ha this time go OUT OF the center of the planet
[0:46:31] <Saltmeisterr> fucking tutorial bot
[0:46:32] <toulon_somberjade> @greatspaceadventure At least tank controls don't require you to get near frame perfect turn and jump to do wall jumps
[0:46:33] <+LastHazzerd> i like that he says "trust your instincts" rathe than "fallow my instructions"
[0:46:37] <%KeiganOfAstora> Move camera to top left since you're blocking the text?
[0:46:38] <%ShinobiPhoenix> it's technoorganic, not alive, but it like metal flesh
[0:46:40] <%megadblitz> has any sequel EVER  had a non bullshit reason for you having to relearn powers and abilities?
[0:46:40] <Dr00_PhD> Birdgil is a strong ass name
[0:46:41] <+TheBitingIrish> "Samus, you fool. You absolute idiot. You utter buffoon."
[0:46:41] <%extradopeness> physical amnesia lmao
[0:46:43] <KasiCrafter> Shut up ADAM!
[0:46:43] <majindusto> AI ADAM > FLESH ADAM
[0:46:44] <robosqueeb> robot looks like goatse lol
[0:46:47] <ElenaManetta> You think Samus can understand this guy or is she also reading the subtitles
[0:46:50] <$OfficerMods> ha ha ha
[0:46:52] <tmvct1> oh we got them all
[0:46:53] <%cvp5127> theres both
[0:46:54] <$OfficerMods> look at this silly boy
[0:46:54] <peachy996> That's from Fusion
[0:46:54] <%KeiganOfAstora> She's part Metroid now?
[0:46:54] <+TheBitingIrish> \
[0:46:56] <BallerSwagBro9k> Kappa Kappa
[0:46:58] <olaksi> half woman half bird half jellyfish
[0:46:59] <%Agami23> yeah that was a fusion thing
[0:47:00] <@ssjklyco> No, it's still hot areas
[0:47:01] <%ShinobiPhoenix> Subtitles
[0:47:01] <$OfficerMods> thinking there won't be a lava world
[0:47:02] <liammichealryan> My legit fav thing about this game is that most Metroids have you moving in a downward direction, but this one has you going up.
[0:47:02] <zk_nails> ho ho ho
[0:47:03] <SpookyCookieMonster> loe pat
[0:47:06] <runewalker01> lol
[0:47:08] <brachydios777> Oh yeah, Samus is part Metroid
[0:47:09] <+lucaflowe> People should really play Fusion
[0:47:09] <%VHGS> @toulon_somberjade If you're against the wall it's fucking ten frames. It's not hard to do.
[0:47:10] <%ShinobiPhoenix> she's been part Metroid s ince Fusion
[0:47:11] <%Maids4lyfe> @KeiganOfAstora since Fusion
[0:47:12] <bahble> Part X Parasite
[0:47:12] <$OfficerMods> part metroid part bird part suit
[0:47:13] <+LastHazzerd> @KeiganOfAstora Fusion has some stuff goin' on
[0:47:17] <+lucaflowe> Pat you should play Fusion
[0:47:17] <+cermo55> she's part a bunch of stuff
[0:47:18] <$OfficerMods> no?
[0:47:19] <peachy996> Yeah when the X attacked her they infused her with Metroid DNA to save her
[0:47:19] <olaksi> wait is samus a goo girl now
[0:47:19] <%Agami23> sorta
[0:47:20] <A_Classy_Gentleman> Oh yeah 100%
[0:47:21] <+healnavi> basically, yes
[0:47:22] <+ReiDuran> Due to Fusion, she's part-Metroid
[0:47:22] <%Bluwizard21> @PatStaresAt She had fused with metroids and chozo dna
[0:47:23] <@GeneralSCPatton> Kind of
[0:47:23] <hollumdusk> A little, yes
[0:47:24] <+D00msDayDan> metroid: resurrection
[0:47:24] <OpenYourEels4TheNextFeels> The Vaccine had Metroid DNA
[0:47:25] <Treasure_Vault> She keeps getting dna spliced in for good luck
[0:47:25] <augustustamerlane> There are both hot and cold areas. Whatevs, he‚Äôll find out soon.
[0:47:25] <%JoshManVGH> Kinda!
[0:47:26] <+Ardailec> She had to be injected with a Vaccine made from Metroid DNA in Fusion
[0:47:26] <%ShinobiPhoenix> Samus is part Bird and Part Jellyfish
[0:47:28] <+ReiDuran> And yeah, it's kinda Alien
[0:47:28] <@ssjklyco> The vaccine makes her an RE villain
[0:47:28] <$OfficerMods> ripley is just a space dragon
[0:47:28] <+FoolsArcade> this games great
[0:47:28] <Totalabyss> riply as alines oir riply as the dragon?
[0:47:29] <+LastHazzerd> actually yeah
[0:47:29] <Parapattern> It rhymes. It's like poetry.
[0:47:31] <%Maids4lyfe> yeah basically @PatStaresAt
[0:47:31] <OldManDeckardCain> pat why did you remind me that alien 4 exists...
[0:47:32] <+jojolity12> Happened in Fusion
[0:47:32] <%extradopeness> she was given a metroid vaccine
[0:47:32] <%Fooguwu> ah yes, ripley. believe it or not
[0:47:33] <majindusto> Samus has Chozo AND Metroid  DNA
[0:47:33] <ohno778> so is Alien resurrection?
[0:47:33] <%megadblitz> ripley scott
[0:47:34] <shotgang86> Play Metroid Fusion guys, a GBA emulator can run even on a microwave watch nowadays
[0:47:36] <hollumdusk> Without the being a clone part, the clones are evil
[0:47:37] <AoiRob> basically the same franchise
[0:47:38] <tanarath> She's... a lot of things now, Play Fusion
[0:47:38] <%Raikouija> the vaccine made her part metroid
[0:47:39] <%RonaldMcDownload> Her tits are just 2 Metroids glued on there
[0:47:41] <+TheBitingIrish> Samus has a bit of everything in her at this point
[0:47:41] <+LazyLuca> Samus is now the Metroid of the Metroid series
[0:47:42] <%shiplord13> Kind of, except she won't as far as we know die in this process
[0:47:44] <TheHappyCynic> wow this looks way better than the trailers
[0:47:49] <%captain_thickthighs> she's a mix of both kinda now
[0:47:49] <%KeiganOfAstora> What game came after Fusion that progressed the timeline? This is the game after that one, right?
[0:47:50] <+PenmanLupine> @OfficioPrefectusCorgi Ripley from Aliens, not Ridley from Metroid
[0:47:52] <+LastHazzerd> @majindusto she started the series with Chozo DNA right?
[0:47:53] <%moink1234> alien spoiilers wtf
[0:47:54] <A_Classy_Gentleman> Yeah, it's the cool parts of Alien(s)
[0:47:54] <$OfficerMods> and you'll need those 60 frames
[0:47:55] <@ssjklyco> They show videos of what the parts do
[0:47:55] <%Monkeyweed21> the opposite, first chozo then phazon then metroid DNA
[0:47:56] <$OfficerMods> no joke
[0:47:57] <Martian571> Every main metroid game can be linked directly to an Alien movie, with Fusion being Resurrection.
[0:47:57] <Goraka91> So when do the Metroids give birth to a half-Samus
[0:47:57] <%baka_sugoi> Really nice
[0:47:58] <brachydios777> Federation gave her Metroid dna to defend against the X parasite
[0:47:58] <%extradopeness> fusion is so damn good
[0:47:59] <%Agami23> following that logic pat, metroid fusion would be alien resurrection
[0:48:00] <%ShinobiPhoenix> she LITERALLY eats the X now (Metroids ate X and were weak to cold)
[0:48:01] <%Maids4lyfe> SO THIS MEANS METROID CAN'T CRAWL IS REAL
[0:48:01] <olaksi> she's been injected with more stuff than jill valentine by now
[0:48:03] <shotgang86> man wall jump in this game is FREE
[0:48:03] <+cermo55> Samus: Human-Chozo-Metroid-Parasie X, am I missing one?
[0:48:04] <%polothegreatest> ANY% for goblin slaying
[0:48:04] <bahble> it also runs super well in an emulator already LUL
[0:48:04] <%nichos7> No, this is the first post-Fusion game
[0:48:05] <%Raikouija> Samus is the ultimate weapon
[0:48:06] <Saltmeisterr> this game is buttery smooth
[0:48:06] <+ArCielArDor> no morph ball
[0:48:08] <StarMechV> @PatStaresAt Samus has Chozo DNA in her, letting her use the power suit; And after getting X Parasite'd she got injected with Metroid DNA. So Samus is like 1/3 human, Chozo and Metroid
[0:48:08] <Heyestus> She got gooped and is not part human, part bird, part metrod and part goo that weads bioregenerative metal armour @patstaresat
[0:48:09] <BigFingerRo> USE YOUR AMIIBAOEOS PAT
[0:48:11] <+ArCielArDor> interesting
[0:48:11] <+RedLanternReview> Yup. Metroid is HEAVILY inspired by Alien so Samus is Ridley but with a gun arm
[0:48:14] <+JK_Spencer> Chozo, Metroid, AND X Parasite DNA.
[0:48:18] <%ShinobiPhoenix> Samus without the Varia and Gravity Suit is weak to cold
[0:48:24] <peachy996> I just love AI Adam more than real Adam so much. He is so much better
[0:48:24] <Parapattern> Nice transition
[0:48:27] <DSD24> Parry that alien
[0:48:31] <OldManDeckardCain> samus has more bs in her than ichigo from bleach LUL
[0:48:32] <%extradopeness> yes amiibao
[0:48:33] <+D00msDayDan> PARRY
[0:48:33] <Goraka91> PogChamp

[0:48:39] <+LazyLuca> METROID HAS A PARRY
[0:48:39] <%ShinobiPhoenix> you will ABSOLUTELY need to do that a lot
[0:48:39] <%king_wragles> Shoot IMMEDIATELY after countering
[0:48:40] <%Agami23> yeah so samus returns added a parry
[0:48:41] <LoneFonte> yup
[0:48:41] <bippityjones> CRAZY
[0:48:41] <$OfficerMods> delete the bug
[0:48:45] <tmvct1> never played samus return lul
[0:48:45] <%nichos7> That smile
[0:48:46] <olaksi> should have named the AI after someone cooler tho
[0:48:47] <majindusto> Yes, Chozo  DNA since raised by Chozo  who helped her survive
[0:48:48] <Saltmeisterr> yes pat :)
[0:48:48] <%GarbageNirvana> That's a Samus Returns thing
[0:48:48] <$insaneintentionsyo> are ya winnin, dad?
[0:48:48] <+pectusumbra> So you don't even have to play the 3DS one
[0:48:51] <+ReznorV> RIPOSTE!
[0:48:52] <AoiRob> REVERSE BLOODBORNE
[0:48:53] <+senfood> That smile haha
[0:48:53] <%ape_hawk> THE DARK SOULS OF METROOOOOID
[0:48:53] <+healnavi> This is a Samus Returns thing
[0:48:54] <%Maids4lyfe> @OldManDeckardCain no one has more bs than ichigo
[0:48:56] <%sandrews> look at the goofy smile
[0:48:59] <%sandrews> he likes it
[0:49:02] <%baka_sugoi> P A R R Y woolieGASM Kreygasm
[0:49:02] <%pilgrimsayswhat> THANKS DARK SOULS
[0:49:02] <mr_mister0> you can move and parry
[0:49:02] <+FreshlyGratedGinger> parries are the best thing in video games
[0:49:03] <%Bailey__Gaming> face cam covered the door there Pat

[0:49:05] <%Forbidden_Karp> riposte that bat
[0:49:05] <$insaneintentionsyo> Pat enjoying himself? bawkSmile
[0:49:06] <StarMechV> @PatStaresAt This was introduced in Samus Returns for the 3DS
[0:49:06] <%captain_thickthighs> look at that boyish grin
[0:49:06] <%JoshManVGH> It feel REALLY good
[0:49:08] <%ShinobiPhoenix> never expect to NOT have to parry or even Dash melee
[0:49:13] <miucsa51> parry Kreygasm
[0:49:14] <SilverFaustX> its samus returns with better gfx
[0:49:19] <peachy996> Liking this spooky cave track
[0:49:22] <%ShinobiPhoenix> they counter when they flash
[0:49:23] <hollumdusk> Parry while running also works wonders with small enemies.
[0:49:27] <%Frranky> only white flashes are counterable
[0:49:29] <%Monkeyweed21> Parries are your main source of health and ammo
[0:49:29] <%GarbageNirvana> Why don't more games have parries
[0:49:32] <bahble> Yes
[0:49:32] <%ape_hawk> ye
[0:49:33] <%ShinobiPhoenix> you can move and Counter now
[0:49:33] <$OfficerMods> yes

[0:49:35] <%Dommykins> yes
[0:49:36] <Tracazoid> Yes
[0:49:36] <hollumdusk> yes
[0:49:36] <+pectusumbra> that is correct!
[0:49:36] <bippityjones> Yes
[0:49:36] <%A_Mighty_Walrus> yeah
[0:49:36] <Saltmeisterr> yep
[0:49:36] <brachydios777> yes
[0:49:36] <runewalker01> yes
[0:49:36] <SilverFaustX> E
[0:49:37] <%GarbageNirvana> It's like the easiest thing to make your game feel more hype
[0:49:37] <+healnavi> yes
[0:49:37] <keatiestofthegribbles> yes
[0:49:37] <%JoshManVGH> yes
[0:49:37] <%nichos7> Yes

[0:49:39] <%Maids4lyfe> yes
[0:49:39] <Zebroneath> yes
[0:49:42] <tanarath> YES
[0:49:44] <+ReznorV> ye
[0:49:44] <+LastHazzerd> E
[0:49:45] <+LokimenD> E
[0:49:46] <ElenaManetta> So you're parrying within the radius circle, you don't need to look at the model animation itself?
[0:49:49] <redwidow1358> Your health is the number by the funky looking E
[0:49:51] <+LazyLuca> you also lose it really fast
[0:49:52] <%Bailey__Gaming> E = HP
[0:49:52] <%Bluwizard21> you also lose it real fast
[0:49:52] <%sirisvirus> enemies drop health
[0:49:54] <majindusto> Better enemy  AI than Samus Returns  too
[0:49:54] <$OfficerMods> she looks better than she ever has
[0:49:55] <%extradopeness> E
[0:49:55] <%baka_sugoi> ye
[0:49:56] <@GeneralSCPatton> E for 'Ealth guvna
[0:49:56] <KosOrSomeSayKosm_> E
[0:50:00] <%JoshManVGH> Parry generates a lot of resources
[0:50:01] <+LazyLuca> a few hits kill KO you no prob
[0:50:01] <liammichealryan> Spoiler: you will also lose it real good and fast
[0:50:01] <Sigma_190_Beta> No, you get HP when you kill an enemy.
[0:50:03] <@Ranryu692> is the shooting 8-directional or 360 degrees?
[0:50:03] <$OfficerMods> its like nintendo actually poured money into this game
[0:50:04] <tmvct1> rip tutorial
[0:50:07] <miucsa51> ye
[0:50:08] <LoneFonte> They really nailed her animations
[0:50:15] <Parapattern> I like that the energy looks like a currency symbol. It's like Samus is carrying around 99 quid in her pocket.
[0:50:15] <$OfficerMods> GOBLIN DEFEATED
[0:50:16] <+cermo55> Goblin slain

[0:57:21] <LoliKappa> Metroid Dog¬Æ coming soon
[0:57:23] <%RonaldMcDownload> those weird dogs ate shit
[0:57:28] <$OfficerMods> NO ACCESS NOT GRANTED
[0:57:29] <SomeAsianDood> You guys remember Yawn?
[0:57:30] <%razielhex> the movement of the enemies and background environments are really good
[0:57:30] <reonome> shhhh
[0:57:31] <%cvp5127> it pretty linear at the start
[0:57:31] <SlangPunk> Uuhhhhh
[0:57:36] <TourettesPlays> Can you do insane sequence breaks with wall jumping in this like you can in Super?b
[0:57:40] <%shiplord13> You see there is something predator like out there
[0:57:41] <dreamfillah> man I love how FAST SHE IS
[0:57:43] <$Jaxnos> i think this 2D Metroid has sunk its teeth into the Pat.
[0:57:43] <$OfficerMods> crazy talk
[0:57:46] <+ReznorV> Where's Mike Rooba?!
[0:57:49] <%ShinobiPhoenix> that's been there since Super
[0:57:52] <%KeiganOfAstora> @cvp5127 Isn't it all linear because it's 2D?
[0:57:55] <tcosmiclatte> that's a shadow complex door
[0:57:57] <hollumdusk> The animations in this game are amazing
[0:57:57] <tmvct1> morph ball bom jump is back
[0:57:58] <SilverFaustX> hah
[0:57:58] <ElenaManetta> Is that a pile of blood behind Samus
[0:58:02] <%extradopeness> thats from fusion as well
[0:58:02] <Treasure_Vault> It's actually kind of cool watching Pat play this with no Fusion or Zero experience.
[0:58:10] <%VHGS> @TourettesPlays it has the wall jump physics from fusion so probably not.
[0:58:10] <%BoxNavy> it feels so bad
[0:58:11] <$OfficerMods> super metroid controls bad its true
[0:58:13] <Gelphaze> You have two chances to parry them watch the arm flash or their head.
[0:58:13] <bippityjones> "ADAM; HOLY FUCK!
[0:58:13] <brachydios777> its old
[0:58:13] <@Ranryu692> try Zero Mission, it's great

[0:58:13] <%Ipsenscastle> same
[0:58:14] <%Monkeyweed21> thats fine
[0:58:15] <%valriot> Yeah thats fine, Super controls like shit
[0:58:15] <%Cozy90> you're a bigger fan than woolie
[0:58:16] <+ThighsSupreme> there is sequence breaking in this game
[0:58:16] <%A_Mighty_Walrus> was it the floatiness?
[0:58:17] <%asgard147> what about this tho?
[0:58:17] <tmvct1> did you like zero mission and fusion?
[0:58:18] <hollumdusk> Max went though the same process, but he got over it.
[0:58:19] <%ShinobiPhoenix> Super Metroid is just old, a remake would fix all that
[0:58:19] <$OfficerMods> its just really really good level design
[0:58:20] <Parapattern> It was kinda clunky
[0:58:20] <Frampis> Fusion and Zero Mission have better controls
[0:58:21] <%Agami23> super metroid was abit stiff and floaty. the camera also felt very zoomed in
[0:58:22] <KasiCrafter> Shut up ADAM!
[0:58:23] <%MugenSandan> There it is, that's the donation sound
[0:58:23] <%Monkeyweed21> Super Metroid is OLD
[0:58:24] <@GeneralSCPatton> That 2nd press of jump is just to transfer into spin for starting a wall jump or screw attack
[0:58:25] <+TaurusOxford> You REALLY should have just played Zero Mission Pat
[0:58:25] <+LastHazzerd> glad this one is more appealin' then
[0:58:25] <%KeiganOfAstora> It was SNES dude, how many games back then had good controls? @PatStaresAt
[0:58:26] <delerim001> there are other metroids my man
[0:58:26] <DSD24> Hackerman
[0:58:27] <+PettyFunk> I was worried it would be too much like Samus Returns (And I really liked that game too) but this seems like such a leap forward
[0:58:28] <jotabranded> so this game will be top 3 for you
[0:58:29] <+NickHatesSnow> The GBA games feel great tho
[0:58:30] <StarMechV> I love how all computers have Cannon USB ports
[0:58:32] <DomunDomunDomun> Hackerbird.
[0:58:32] <SilverFaustX> zero mission is so good
[0:58:32] <tcosmiclatte> Actually a lot of this reminds me of Shadow complex
[0:58:34] <grimm_hatter> jumps were super wonky
[0:58:36] <$OfficerMods> super contra
[0:58:40] <+MajorCrasher> "capture"
[0:58:41] <$OfficerMods> super mario world
[0:58:42] <%MrP33Ps> Nice, her dead AI boyfriend
[0:58:43] <SlangPunk> Can‚Äôt blame you for that, super Metroid is an acquired taste with its controls
[0:58:44] <dd44dostivei> super metroid's control is a skill to be built
[0:58:45] <$OfficerMods> castle vania
[0:58:47] <$OfficerMods> uh
[0:58:47] <digaogrunge> This seems really similar to SM tho
[0:58:47] <tanarath> Super Metriod controls pretty jank, compared to current games, ignore it.
[0:58:49] <+PettyFunk> Metroid Fusion is still pretty fun, but yeah Super has aged
[0:58:51] <%vapelad_dabberb01> has nothing to do with the game being old, plenty of old games feel good to play
[0:58:51] <%ShinobiPhoenix> they can HEAR you
[0:58:51] <%extradopeness> the controls are the worst part of the game
[0:58:52] <%DrFacilier> things hacked, shits fucked
[0:58:54] <+NickHatesSnow> Why did you start at the 3rd game Pat?
[0:58:55] <%ShinobiPhoenix> and they will HUNT  YOUR ASS
[0:58:57] <Saltmeisterr> adam shut the FUCK up
[0:59:01] <Manwad> his voice is so good
[0:59:09] <%Deft_Thought> Can't wait for the scenario where you have to run from two of these motherfuckers
[0:59:12] <%extradopeness> fusion is actually great
[0:59:13] <%Deft_Thought> You know its gonna happen
[0:59:15] <%Frranky> this is actual useful information
[0:59:15] <%ShinobiPhoenix> if they are on your radar, they can hear you
[0:59:17] <bippityjones> Solid synth doice
[0:59:18] <%baka_sugoi> okay
[0:59:18] <+NickHatesSnow> This is the good Adam, he's allowed to talk
[0:59:21] <%razielhex> anyway, sorry we released Yaut'ja in the world Samus.  Good luck.
[0:59:22] <%twistedj3ster> why would they just unlock the doors lol
[0:59:22] <%RonaldMcDownload> Adam you're blowing out the bass here, adjust your board
[0:59:25] <redwidow1358> The EMMI are actually super smart at tracking you, and they move super smoothly too.
[0:59:25] <+MajorCrasher> oh
[0:59:25] <tmvct1> hes not wrong
[0:59:27] <Hydrapissed> parry it
[0:59:31] <%ShinobiPhoenix> I got it ONCE
[0:59:33] <%Frranky> getting the counter on the EMMI is super hard
[0:59:33] <$OfficerMods> BUT YOU WILL FEEL REALLY COOL IF YOU DO ESCAPE SAMUS
[0:59:35] <TheHappyCynic> the only good adam is a dead adam
[0:59:35] <brunoberserk> exists a romhack that changes super metroid gameplay , making more similar to zero mission/fusion
[0:59:37] <%extradopeness> yeah adam sounds exactly how i always thought he should
[0:59:40] <Treasure_Vault> Game for kids
[0:59:41] <Zudrag> can't see the leftmost 15% of the text
[0:59:41] <hollumdusk> In other words, don't even attempt to rely on parrying the ***
[0:59:43] <dd44dostivei> Super Metroid's control is a bit classic castlevania
[0:59:44] <%BlackStarAura> all your base are belong to us
[0:59:44] <%ShinobiPhoenix> EMMI is there to murder your ass
[0:59:47] <Saltmeisterr> KILL
[0:59:48] <+D00msDayDan> priority: survive
[0:59:49] <Parapattern> Is cyber Adam gonna make a thumbs up with his pixels just to really hammer it home?
[0:59:49] <grimm_hatter> fusion again
[0:59:50] <Treasure_Vault> Tell kids what to do, even if it takes them a while to do it
[0:59:53] <%Frranky> like you have to hit the EMMI counter before the flash for it or you die anyway
[0:59:53] <+PettyFunk> Man Samus looks great
[0:59:54] <%G_Thunders> ‚ÄúI don‚Äôt believe in you at all, Samus.‚Äù
[0:59:54] <BallerSwagBro9k> Parrying EMMI is quite hard
[0:59:55] <@GeneralSCPatton> It's the only one shot kill in the series I'm aware of
[0:59:58] <+ReiDuran> They do a REAL good job of making the EMMI into a threat
[0:59:58] <+NickHatesSnow> Yeah the super metroid GBA romhack is godlike
[0:59:58] <%extradopeness> @thehappycynic well i mean he is
[1:00:00] <%Deft_Thought> @redwidow1358 Yeah, it was freaky watching them climb shit
[1:00:00] <%baka_sugoi> K I L L
[1:00:03] <LoliKappa> it's like SA-X but not as scary
[1:00:05] <$ringabal> IT's fine
[1:00:06] <ElenaManetta> That'll cover your ammo
[1:00:07] <KnivesEve> the Mr. X system

[1:00:21] <OpenYourEels4TheNextFeels> It's fine
[1:00:21] <LoneFonte> right below health
[1:00:21] <Sigma_190_Beta> Top middle is better.
[1:00:22] <Shwepie> All corners are taken.
[1:00:22] <+meattube1> go below ammo?
[1:00:23] <@GeneralSCPatton> Text is rare enough
[1:00:23] <linSP> Hey pat how you liking the game so far
[1:00:23] <%KeiganOfAstora> We don't need the map
[1:00:23] <Frampis> or top right but a bit left
[1:00:24] <%ape_hawk> face cam only
[1:00:24] <peachy996> That might work
[1:00:24] <Dr00_PhD> I'd rather not have text than not health or map
[1:00:24] <Treasure_Vault> It's fine, top is bad
[1:00:24] <%vehementvadr> eh
[1:00:24] <+SpaciousWheat> Its like SA X but more annoying more like it

[1:00:55] <SaltyAzteca> OHHH ITS SO PRETTYYYYY
[1:00:56] <+Sendrak70> Shrink yourself and map it to the movement of Samus.

[1:01:01] <TheHeroAppears> time to stream snipe
[1:01:02] <theanora1> Cover up the map so none of us get map spoilers

[1:01:28] <+Cuon_Alpinus> why cant metroid crawl
[1:01:28] <$OfficerMods> neve trust a wall
[1:01:29] <Manwad> why can't metroid crawl
[1:01:29] <mike2hands> NEED BALL i think
[1:01:31] <@Ranryu692> you don't have the balls to get in there

[1:01:44] <JayEarly> of course Galactic Federation make the ultimate Space Pirate killing machine well after the Space Pirate problem has been solved
[1:01:48] <+LastHazzerd> why can't metroid ball?
[1:01:51] <%ShinobiPhoenix> RED DOT ON MAP
[1:01:55] <ElenaManetta> i like this room's music
[1:01:56] <dreamfillah> god damnit SHE MOVES SO FAST
[1:01:56] <liammichealryan> EMMI want go to colleg
[1:01:56] <%polothegreatest> it sounds spooky psaUp
[1:01:57] <notgarza> the atmosphere is crazy
[1:01:58] <OneThousandTomatoes> i think the beeping means that
[1:01:59] <dreamfillah> I lov eit
[1:02:02] <%Deft_Thought> Man, don't like it
[1:02:07] <Treasure_Vault> Funnel you forward
[1:02:12] <Parapattern> Man they are ramping up the Aliens vibe a LOT
[1:02:15] <%ShinobiPhoenix> if Red Dot is on map, they can hear you if they even remotely near
[1:02:18] <$OfficerMods> PENETRATED
[1:02:24] <%kewlmyc> Deaths: 2
[1:02:25] <ElenaManetta> oh no insta-death enemies :(
[1:02:26] <mike2hands> ARIGHT
[1:02:27] <+TaurusOxford> REKT
[1:02:27] <SaltyAzteca> Instant Game Over wtf
[1:02:29] <%dapperdoop> I like the little kick
[1:02:30] <macmens> yaeh its frame perfect
[1:02:31] <%baka_sugoi> dang
[1:02:34] <+ReiDuran> Literally only one chance
[1:02:35] <+LastHazzerd> correct
[1:02:35] <%ShinobiPhoenix> Metroid Pac-Man
[1:02:35] <%vehementvadr> face stab
[1:02:36] <+megaman_sentinel> 2
[1:02:37] <brunoberserk> that escalated quickly
[1:02:37] <%Deft_Thought> Those cute ass lil beeps are some bullshit. Scary ass motherfuckers.
[1:02:37] <%twistedj3ster> it hears and then it sees woman and then it kills
[1:02:41] <@OfficioPrefectusCorgi> Counter on them frame prefect
[1:02:41] <reonome> damn that parry window is tiny
[1:02:42] <%Frranky> it's insta-death but they also autosave before every EMMI Zone
[1:02:44] <%nichos7> The window is very narrow
[1:02:44] <+fetrigon> atpGasm
[1:02:45] <+lucaflowe> Frame perfect for the flash
[1:02:48] <redwidow1358> Keep an eye on that mini-map, they appear as a big scary ominous red dot
[1:02:49] <%ShinobiPhoenix> I was spinning in circles for a while avoiding one
[1:02:49] <OneThousandTomatoes> there's a parry opportunity it's just small and they tell you that
[1:02:50] <LoneFonte> at least the game autosaves you right before entering it
[1:02:50] <$OfficerMods> it might as well be a 99% chance
[1:02:53] <%ShinobiPhoenix> YES
[1:02:53] <%solracc25> it is very precise
[1:02:54] <%twistedj3ster> it's basically Paige
[1:02:55] <%Frranky> You have to hit it BEFORE the flash
[1:02:55] <jotabranded> yep
[1:02:55] <peachy996> It's Robo-Paige
[1:02:55] <%HiroTSK5> Yes
[1:02:55] <$OfficerMods> its frame perfect and random
[1:02:57] <tmvct1> but two chances
[1:02:57] <homestylewaffles> lol like game over means anything, it checkpoints you right there
[1:02:58] <%Frranky> Like you have to predict it
[1:02:59] <macmens> its tight as hell
[1:02:59] <$OfficerMods> random timing
[1:03:00] <+lucaflowe> The flash and it is yes
[1:03:00] <hollumdusk> Almost
[1:03:00] <%Maids4lyfe> yes
[1:03:01] <+TaurusOxford> it's pretty much frame perfect.
[1:03:02] <%ShinobiPhoenix> and it's actually a trick
[1:03:02] <%ValHollaYoloson> Yes
[1:03:02] <%MrP33Ps> I never got it
[1:03:03] <+healnavi> it's like 3
[1:03:03] <%Monkeyweed21> it might be
[1:03:03] <%nichos7> Basically
[1:03:04] <SlangPunk> I love that they‚Äôre killing you as a byproduct of getting a dna sample
[1:03:04] <i_chevalier> pat the map changes color inside the map. so now you can know if you've been through a door or not
[1:03:05] <tanarath> It's hard
[1:03:06] <+ReiDuran> it's PRETTY MUCH frame perfect yes
[1:03:06] <%Bluwizard21> Its damn close
[1:03:07] <A_Classy_Gentleman> I've hit it exactly ONCE
[1:03:08] <%ShinobiPhoenix> you have to do it TWICE
[1:03:08] <+LastHazzerd> it's not meant to be a reliable option
[1:03:08] <Saltmeisterr> u get two chances tho @PatStaresAt
[1:03:09] <dreamfillah> jeeez
[1:03:10] <redwidow1358> It's basically frame perfect
[1:03:10] <%greencapps> it's very tight
[1:03:12] <dreamfillah> that's tense
[1:03:12] <ashuckel> if the parry is too easy then they are not a threat
[1:03:13] <%BoxNavy> owned
[1:03:14] <%nichos7> Haul ass Pat!
[1:03:15] <%shiplord13> Pretty sure it said it would difficult in the tutorial
[1:03:15] <%GustauveVIII> have to predict really hard
[1:03:15] <%greencapps> I've done it twice
[1:03:16] <%RealThiele> ive gotten it twice and its ahrd af
[1:03:16] <+TaurusOxford> LUL
[1:03:17] <SaltyAzteca> NotLikeThis
[1:03:18] <CriticKitten> LUL
[1:03:18] <+jojolity12> Not frame perfect but tight
[1:03:18] <+fetrigon> "virtually impossible"
[1:03:19] <%ShinobiPhoenix> because I did it and then I had to do it AGAIN
[1:03:20] <%solracc25> mostly frame perfect
[1:03:29] <reonome> YOU JUMPED RIGHT INTO IT
[1:03:34] <OneThousandTomatoes> i think it's good though, they should be a threat
[1:03:35] <djblue_shift> LUL LUL LUL
[1:03:35] <ElenaManetta> BUT YOU WENT INTO ANOTHER SCREEN
[1:03:35] <%baka_sugoi> f
[1:03:35] <dreamfillah> Holy shit they're actually tough to run away from
[1:03:37] <+LastHazzerd> if you get caught that's supposed to be the punishment
[1:03:37] <+MajorCrasher> LUL
[1:03:37] <ElenaManetta> YOU SHOULD BE SAFE
[1:03:38] <Gelphaze> You have two chances to parry an E.M.M.I, watch the arm flash or their head.
[1:03:38] <%BoxNavy> the timing is super strict
[1:03:38] <SaltyAzteca> YA GON GET PROBED
[1:03:39] <Goraka91> MORTIS
[1:03:40] <%shiplord13> 4
[1:03:41] <mike2hands> when do you press button?
[1:03:42] <%shiplord13> 3
[1:03:44] <JayEarly> can you counter them once they pinned you or is that just false hope
[1:03:45] <+D00msDayDan> the kick looks so silly
[1:03:49] <%polothegreatest> HAND OR EYE
[1:03:49] <+ekodrop> two chances don't uck
[1:03:51] <KosOrSomeSayKosm_> "yeah this'll do it"
[1:03:53] <peachy996> I love that it's so fast
[1:03:54] <%dapperdoop> like "eh..."
[1:03:55] <Estuko> @mike2hands same frame as the flash from the robot
[1:03:57] <LoneFonte> @mike2hands when eye flashes
[1:04:02] <OneThousandTomatoes> oh are we keeping a death counter?
[1:04:03] <%CodeKirugin> Love the detail if you fail, neat animation.
[1:04:08] <peachy996> Like no drawn out death just insta-ded
[1:04:10] <+LastHazzerd> @JayEarly yes, but it's frame perfect and intentionally unreliable
[1:04:13] <CaptainBright> the parry timing is not constant; IT VARIES
[1:04:14] <%ShinobiPhoenix> @JayEarly it's only false hope if you suck... and we all mostly suck
[1:04:15] <grimm_hatter> we gonna be here for a while
[1:04:18] <PanicSwytch> Pat u have 2 chances to parry. once when it closes in and a second when it grabs u
[1:04:18] <$OfficerMods> oh that death counter is gonna spike later
[1:04:19] <Officialchourico> god i love how futile this feels lmao
[1:04:21] <%polothegreatest> its 3 psa1guy
[1:04:21] <olaksi> what
[1:04:22] <redwidow1358> You can counter just before the bright red flash, but you basically have to die several times to understand the timing
[1:04:23] <SaltyAzteca> Paaaat
[1:04:23] <+silentblast93> yo pat hows the game so far?
[1:04:24] <Parapattern> ??????
[1:04:25] <+MajorCrasher> LUL
[1:04:26] <StarMechV> pffft
[1:04:26] <%Maids4lyfe> STOP THAT
[1:04:28] <%baka_sugoi> way ta go
[1:04:28] <Frade> all the beep beep boop music
[1:04:29] <$OfficerMods> this is easily the hardest metroid
[1:04:29] <CriticKitten> NotLikeThis
[1:04:30] <+fetrigon> atpRtsd4
[1:04:31] <%extradopeness> i did it like three or four times out of 10-15 instances
[1:04:31] <$OfficerMods> hands down
[1:04:33] <MittensBroadcast> cause the bad at the video game
[1:04:37] <%HiroTSK5> You will Pat, you will
[1:04:37] <%ShinobiPhoenix> I am not complaining at all
[1:04:38] <MittensBroadcast> *they bad
[1:04:41] <%lehvak182> the All Important Map huh?
[1:04:41] <+ReiDuran> Who would complain about these guys
[1:04:41] <%BoxNavy> theyre a liiiiitle annoying but also legit scary so its fine :)
[1:04:42] <JetpackMcQuack> they're even kinda scary
[1:04:42] <OneThousandTomatoes> the game is called dread
[1:04:42] <+healnavi> "DYING BAD"
[1:04:43] <%solracc25> imagine speedrunning this game
[1:04:43] <ElenaManetta> Im gonna guess in later levels, insta-death will be annoying
[1:04:45] <+jofrankii> Yeah i love the enmi
[1:04:46] <%Frranky> it'd be a problem if you didn't get autosaves every time you enter the EMMI zone
[1:04:51] <s1rcuit> oh geez I didn't know they could follow through doors
[1:04:55] <+LastHazzerd> people don't like gameplay that forces you to adapt
[1:04:58] <+MajorCrasher> what causes the beeping?
[1:04:59] <%nichos7> The walls always lie
[1:05:00] <dreamfillah> HAHAH
[1:05:02] <%ShinobiPhoenix> it's freaking great, but they are as bad as Mr X
[1:05:04] <draca23> it 'ruins the Metroid feel' which is total BS if you played Fusion
[1:05:04] <%baka_sugoi> WutFace OOPS
[1:05:07] <%nichos7> And now you led him right to you
[1:05:08] <%extradopeness> LUL
[1:05:09] <$OfficerMods> there are MASSIVE sequence breaks in this game
[1:05:11] <Estuko> monkaS
[1:05:11] <$OfficerMods> its great
[1:05:11] <+dmbender> evening fellas
[1:05:12] <dreamfillah> God I'm so happy they can Mr X y ou
[1:05:13] <Frampis> how many times has he been killed by the EMMI?
[1:05:14] <ElenaManetta> that was a perfect frame jump out of his cone of vision
[1:05:15] <OneThousandTomatoes> nice
[1:05:15] <@GeneralSCPatton> Nice juke
[1:05:15] <%ShinobiPhoenix> they are not static, it's VERY random and they have pathways in the vents
[1:05:18] <+LastHazzerd> JUKED
[1:05:18] <SaltyAzteca> Theyre worst than lying blocks! Theyre gacha blocks!
[1:05:19] <+fetrigon> LUL LUL LUL
[1:05:23] <%ScreamLord> Mettroid: Isolation
[1:05:24] <+jojolity12> That was a good scare
[1:05:29] <OneThousandTomatoes> D:
[1:05:31] <mike2hands> YOU DEED IT
[1:05:32] <%baka_sugoi> heart racing
[1:05:37] <zerointelligence000> that sequence gave me dread
[1:05:37] <GhostKaiju> Oh that was really good
[1:05:38] <dreamfillah> da BABY
[1:05:38] <%Dementedpenguin> psaGib
[1:05:41] <StarMechV> THE BABY
[1:05:45] <+healnavi> The people who hate EMMIs also hate Mr. X
[1:05:45] <%ShinobiPhoenix> there is MANY more tense moments with them
[1:05:47] <blue8moon> being chased in games gives me such anxiety
[1:05:49] <%baka_sugoi> psaWink
[1:05:49] <+LastHazzerd> oh i didn't know you could do markers
[1:05:50] <MittensBroadcast> SQUAT ROOM
[1:05:51] <Frampis> Mertoid Derd
[1:05:54] <+jojolity12> The sections are short enough that they're a nice change of pace.
[1:05:54] <GhostKaiju> Seeing a Metroid game going in on a tense horror atmosphere is GREAT
[1:05:54] <Sigma_190_Beta> The water from the game looked like it was coming out of Elmo.
[1:05:57] <%ShinobiPhoenix> you have to go through EMMI Zones A FUCKTON
[1:05:57] <Gelphaze> You have two chances to parry an E.M.M.I, watch the arm flash or their head.
[1:05:59] <%baka_sugoi> the REAL baby
[1:05:59] <+DeadlyPeaks> Dread was the perfect title
[1:05:59] <Saltmeisterr> SQUATS
[1:06:06] <+jojolity12> Plus killing them is gonna feel good
[1:06:08] <%extradopeness> this games pretty good
[1:06:09] <$OfficerMods> @blue8moon ha ha this game is designed to fuck with you then
[1:06:09] <scarman125> is this gonna be a full playthrough?
[1:06:14] <%BoxNavy> yeah
[1:06:18] <cartakus> psaGib
[1:06:23] <%Dementedpenguin> bless
[1:06:23] <%BoxNavy> its the best feeling game ive played in a while
[1:06:23] <@Ranryu692> lol remember Metroid Prime 4?
[1:06:24] <%baka_sugoi> bless
[1:06:25] <roobanguy> so whats the justification that you cant fight the robot
[1:06:25] <SaltyAzteca> REPPUKEN
[1:06:26] <+basedfer> bless you
[1:06:26] <$OfficerMods> its the best metroid imo
[1:06:29] <dreamfillah> so glad they nailed the controls
[1:06:29] <+titansloth93> gesundheit
[1:06:35] <$OfficerMods> its hard to find fault in it
[1:06:35] <PlaidisTheNewPlaid> Big man sneeze for a big man
[1:06:40] <%ShinobiPhoenix> I am very in love, the only reason I am not playing now si because I am watching Pat
[1:06:40] <%zettig> It feels so much faster than any of the other 2D metroids, but I can't tell if that's in my head.
[1:06:42] <xeros720> been playing for the last 8-10 hours? i wish i could check with the switch, game good
[1:06:42] <+fetrigon> @ranryu692 no atpRtsd4
[1:06:43] <+pectusumbra> that is a metroid
[1:06:43] <MittensBroadcast> @scarman125 i hope so, i cant imagine its super long so he can do it
[1:06:43] <%nichos7> That's how Metroid do
[1:06:44] <@ssjklyco> Which is funny since it's made by Mercury Steam, who did the bad Castlevania
[1:06:47] <%Nobody404> @roobanguy She mentions theyre made from "the strongest stuff in the universe" in the intro text
[1:06:49] <majindusto> Reminder: MercurySteam made this
[1:06:52] <GhostKaiju> @roobanguy Weapon proof armor, and they just do not fuck around. They grab you, you die
[1:06:55] <+silentblast93> so are the metroid extinct at this point?
[1:06:58] <%Ziegsy> for now
[1:07:01] <$OfficerMods> bosses later on will make you realize it shouldn't be a toggle
[1:07:02] <%razielhex> WATER PUZZLE
[1:07:04] <JayEarly> One detail I like is how Samus has a special firing pose if you shoot after a running counter
[1:07:04] <%pilgrimsayswhat> This soundtrack FUCKS
[1:07:09] <$OfficerMods> it needs to be beam then missile then beam
[1:07:13] <%BoxNavy> he can
[1:07:15] <DomunDomunDomun> You know what game missiles were a toggle in? Super.
[1:07:21] <+Sendrak70> Samus will not lower herself to crawl.
[1:07:21] <JayEarly> and it's based on a piece of Metroid Prime art
[1:07:28] <%ShinobiPhoenix> it's almost like Samus is the only Metroid left in the universe
[1:07:28] <%baka_sugoi> Kreygasm
[1:07:29] <+bromeme> Metroid can crawl in Zero Mission
[1:07:29] <brachydios777> BIRD room
[1:07:30] <PlaidisTheNewPlaid> I can't believe that Jane Metroid can't crawl??
[1:07:37] <dreamfillah> big zones
[1:07:39] <LoliKappa> everything in metroid has a Universal Fisting Interface
[1:07:40] <lloyddboy> MAP JUICE
[1:07:47] <%polothegreatest> Mighty Birds
[1:07:47] <mar_krow> Bird ppl
[1:07:49] <%extradopeness> COOLEST MAP ROOM
[1:07:51] <+titansloth93> big chungus map
[1:07:56] <%BoxNavy> its FAT
[1:07:58] <dreamfillah> BIG THICC
[1:08:01] <3Xgilly> How do you feel about the controls?????
[1:08:02] <$OfficerMods> and if you don't have a gun fist you just plug a usb into your gun
[1:08:08] <tmvct1> global map
[1:08:10] <%ShinobiPhoenix> there are many more
[1:08:13] <DomunDomunDomun> @LoliKappa Just like birds.
[1:08:16] <$OfficerMods> all smart phones in the metroid universe are actually guns
[1:08:16] <%ShinobiPhoenix> i am only up to 4
[1:08:17] <%megadblitz> wheres Metroid this game has you play as Samus..is it like legend of zelda where u dont play as that caharacter?
[1:08:17] <%VHGS> what
[1:08:20] <JayEarly> I love Super Metroid but some of the controls are kind of wack after playing the GBA games first
[1:08:21] <%Ziegsy> how did gief do at school?
[1:08:22] <+D00msDayDan> yeah fuck right on top of it
[1:08:23] <%KeiganOfAstora> That thing screamed in death
[1:08:25] <peachy996> FUCK ON THIS?
[1:08:33] <peachy996> WHERE'S THAT REFEREE?
[1:08:36] <PwnyB> Wanna try that again? lol
[1:08:37] <JayEarly> is the weird moonwalk option in Super Metroid ever useful
[1:08:40] <LoneFonte> I seems gigantic but you kinda zoom through it with this mobility
[1:08:49] <mar_krow> On the rock
[1:08:51] <%extradopeness> i need to play zero mission
[1:08:57] <%ShinobiPhoenix> @PatStaresAt get used to using the Dash Melee, it iwll be your best friend
[1:08:58] <%BoxNavy> monkaS
[1:08:58] <omnishadeee> @JayEarly has a niche use in speedrunning where it lets u fall faster
[1:09:02] <$OfficerMods> the moon walk was VERY useful in am2r
[1:09:04] <RayShadow278> Super was definitely fun and lives to the legend but Zero Mission is peak controls for me
[1:09:06] <SaltyAzteca> @peachy996 He was trying to FUCK ON ME
[1:09:37] <redwidow1358> Hit the floaty metal things in the EMMI zone with missiles to break them
[1:09:40] <%nichos7> You are never safe in an EMMI Zone
[1:09:43] <RayShadow278> Is it possible to single wall jump on this one?
[1:09:45] <%Frranky> you did it
[1:09:55] <%Monkeyweed21> HES STILL COMING
[1:09:55] <redwidow1358> Not possible to single wall jump
[1:10:02] <GhostKaiju> It would have been so cool if you could just crush it in that hallway
[1:10:06] <%ShinobiPhoenix> SHE IS COMING FOR YOu
[1:10:06] <RayShadow278> Thanks
[1:10:06] <%Deft_Thought> I do not like them
[1:10:10] <+silentblast93> morpball
[1:10:11] <+LastHazzerd> EMMI chan!
[1:10:11] <%extradopeness> LETS GOOOO
[1:10:11] <redwidow1358> Well, the EMMIs start comin' and they don't stop comin'
[1:10:16] <@OfficioPrefectusCorgi> Health
[1:10:18] <%Frranky> purple is health refill
[1:10:21] <Dr00_PhD> health regen
[1:10:25] <PlaidisTheNewPlaid> The Beep-Boop robo dog is trying to get the fuck on James Metroid??
[1:10:25] <Tempmael> i like the cat and mouse game, feels like fusion
[1:10:26] <miucsa51> dread it run from it
[1:10:26] <Frampis> they stop coming when you leave their area tho
[1:10:35] <RayShadow278> So how's the game feel, Pat?
[1:10:47] <%razielhex> BAAAALLLLL
[1:10:48] <dreamfillah> yeah
[1:10:49] <dreamfillah> BALL
[1:10:51] <homestylewaffles> PogChamp
[1:10:51] <%ShinobiPhoenix> NOT BALL
[1:10:52] <%razielhex> aww
[1:10:52] <%BoxNavy> Chorge
[1:10:53] <Saltmeisterr> liBIRD
[1:10:54] <SaltyAzteca> WEEEOOOOOW
[1:10:54] <+titansloth93> lot of Hollow Knight vibes in this game
[1:10:55] <%iHum4n> There it is
[1:10:55] <$OfficerMods> this game will never ever stop teasing you with places you want to go
[1:10:56] <%ShinobiPhoenix> I was mad!
[1:10:56] <dreamfillah> Oh, BEAAAM
[1:10:57] <%baka_sugoi> psaDab
[1:10:57] <%nichos7> Charge beeeeeeeeeeeaaaaaaaaaaaaaam
[1:10:58] <%BisoromiBear> woolieYE woolieYE woolieYE
[1:10:58] <tmvct1> there itt is
[1:10:58] <Treasure_Vault> BALLL
[1:10:59] <buddhistmetal> there's the jingle!
[1:10:59] <RayShadow278> Charge Beam AN HOUR IN?!
[1:10:59] <alaskanbullwurm> CHARGE BEAM GET
[1:11:00] <Vivirmos> Ohhhhhh that's good
[1:11:00] <+fetrigon> KomodoHype KomodoHype KomodoHype
[1:11:01] <KosOrSomeSayKosm_> KIRAKIRA BIIIIIIIIIMUUU
[1:11:02] <LoneFonte> Kreygasm
[1:11:03] <%asgard147> limesYay
[1:11:04] <brachydios777> FAN FARE
[1:11:04] <StarMechV> there's the jingle
[1:11:05] <hassanico2> You expected Ball but it was me, CHARGE
[1:11:05] <%twistedj3ster> it did the noise
[1:11:07] <%polothegreatest> BIG SHOT
[1:11:07] <SlangPunk> Damn the emmis are phenomenal at making the player stop paying attention to going slow to explore, that‚Äôs hit will funnel you where it wants through panic
[1:11:11] <toulon_somberjade> time for [BIG SHOTS]
[1:11:12] <SomeAsianDood> time for the actual game Pog
[1:11:18] <%ShinobiPhoenix> and the timer begins on how long before you get ball
[1:11:35] <%nichos7> Screw attack!
[1:11:35] <dreamfillah> @SlangPunk They're a great way to divert you from your intended path
[1:11:36] <%extradopeness> the jump is so good
[1:11:36] <%megadblitz> is that a hitbox?
[1:11:36] <%ShinobiPhoenix> the answer will shock how long you play this game WITHOUT ball
[1:11:38] <JayEarly> this game feels like an HD gamecube game visually and I mean that in the nicest way possible
[1:11:38] <homestylewaffles> discount screw attack
[1:11:39] <OneThousandTomatoes> oh cool
[1:11:39] <%nichos7> Not actually, but close
[1:11:41] <mr_mister0> mini screwattack
[1:11:44] <hassanico2> First room :)
[1:11:46] <$OfficerMods> they really tease the shit out of the ball
[1:11:48] <miucsa51> speen
[1:11:56] <%AgniBrandt> Just got here. Did Pat finally find a Metroid game in which he doesn't hate movement?
[1:11:58] <%razielhex> that background
[1:11:59] <%Frranky> those guys do so much damage
[1:12:00] <RayShadow278> @JayEarly GameCube games look REALLY GOOD even today
[1:12:05] <%ShinobiPhoenix> the Charge Screw Attack has been there since SUPER, this game just makes a point of telling you about it
[1:12:05] <redwidow1358> Yeah, when the enemies go click, you parry
[1:12:07] <%Frranky> a lot of things in this game do a ton of damage
[1:12:13] <i_chevalier> I'm starting to remember how much fun metroid is
[1:12:13] <%BoxNavy> E
[1:12:17] <@OfficioPrefectusCorgi> E
[1:12:20] <homestylewaffles> @AgniBrandt he spent the first 5 minutes lauding it
[1:12:21] <+fetrigon> @agnibrandt no PunOko
[1:12:22] <Zeif00> How did the parry feel?
[1:12:23] <RayShadow278> hElth
[1:12:23] <brachydios777> E
[1:12:24] <Saltmeisterr> E
[1:12:25] <%zettig> E
[1:12:25] <redwidow1358> E
[1:12:26] <miucsa51> parry is just the zandatsu of this game isn't LUL
[1:12:26] <+LastHazzerd> E
[1:12:27] <mr_mister0> E
[1:12:27] <SaltyAzteca> The E is for Energy Kappa
[1:12:29] <%CatastropheCorvid> So what's the justification for Samus not having her upgrades in this one?
[1:12:31] <%AgniBrandt> SICK
[1:12:31] <PlaidisTheNewPlaid> +100 to fun reserve
[1:12:45] <redwidow1358> We don't know yet @catastrophecorvid
[1:12:49] <$OfficerMods> well on standard def prime doesn't look that great but on prime hack yeah it might as well be a new game
[1:12:50] <+pectusumbra> @CatastropheCorvid got choked out by an evil chozo
[1:12:51] <%ShinobiPhoenix> @CatastropheCorvid something took it from her
[1:12:53] <anAngryHamster> @CatastropheCorvid SHut up, that's why!
[1:12:55] <+fetrigon> @catastrophecorvid chozo vergil
[1:12:56] <+bloodrune8864> Remember if you parry while moving you can increase the parry window as well as do some decent damage
[1:13:05] <%ShinobiPhoenix> we don't actually know if the Chozo took them
[1:13:08] <JayEarly> also it's insane Mercury Steam had a game this good in em
[1:13:08] <SaltyAzteca> Dark Souls parrying eh? so is this the dark souls of Metroid games? Kappa
[1:13:08] <dreamfillah> I like there's a variety of enemies you're supposed to counter and enemies you'll just pew pew pew
[1:13:17] <+JK_Spencer> Samus got her ass handed to her by a Chozo?
[1:13:20] <+titansloth93> disrespect the wildlife
[1:13:22] <%ShinobiPhoenix> and personally, I have my doubts about that
[1:13:25] <%CatastropheCorvid> Thanks guys!
[1:13:37] <RyuuAoi> Pat are you beating tonight?
[1:13:41] <@OfficioPrefectusCorgi> @PatStaresAt Run and Counter
[1:13:41] <%extradopeness> real fake doors
[1:13:42] <Sigma_190_Beta> No it's not. The room isn't flashing.
[1:13:49] <+Saggitori> its a faaake
[1:13:50] <JustAnotherTrapArtist> Man this looks fuckin TIGHT
[1:13:56] <%ShinobiPhoenix> but there are some ANNOYING ass enemies that Dash Melee saved my life
[1:13:57] <+bloodrune8864> Rockets can reveal fake walls
[1:14:04] <$OfficerMods> oh no he's going in circles
[1:14:06] <JetpackMcQuack> lol that animation
[1:14:09] <zerointelligence000> god I miss my switch rn :(
[1:14:10] <JayEarly> @RyuuAoi from what I understand this is by far the longest 2D metroid
[1:14:18] <+bromeme> what happens if you charge melee?
[1:14:19] <OneThousandTomatoes> can you counter while charging?
[1:14:23] <%baka_sugoi> B I R D
[1:14:24] <+FreshlyGratedGinger> try rockets on fake walls
[1:14:26] <killjoy0025> Her suit looks awesome in this
[1:14:29] <Ozavic> Birds got big dicks
[1:14:29] <RyuuAoi> Fun Fact: This is the first Metroid game Pat has EVER played Keepo
[1:14:30] <mr_mister0> it is definitley the longest metroid
[1:14:34] <%ShinobiPhoenix> parry doesn't do damage on its own, but DASH Melee is offensive and deals damage on its own
[1:14:35] <mr_mister0> game's huge
[1:14:40] <%razielhex> Mines
[1:14:42] <%extradopeness> yee
[1:14:43] <%Ipsenscastle> The Chozo statues look exactly like the Collectors
[1:14:43] <SaltyAzteca> looks like a bomb
[1:14:45] <+pectusumbra> is that charge beam?
[1:14:46] <RyuuAoi> @jayearly Praise Space Jesus
[1:14:46] <Tempmael> bomba time?
[1:14:47] <Manwad> WOKE
[1:14:48] <%razielhex> They're for ball mines

[1:15:10] <%ShinobiPhoenix> I am enjoying chat not knowing what taht is
[1:15:12] <+TheRockingM> staaaars
[1:15:18] <artificiallynatural> I love the build up to its activation
[1:15:22] <%polothegreatest> AYAYAAAA
[1:15:24] <GhostKaiju> Its the Monitor from Halo's Cold Storage monkaS
[1:15:30] <%BoxNavy> i know what it is but still. scary monkaS
[1:15:31] <RyuuAoi> Woolie won't play this for 5 year.
[1:15:31] <+LastHazzerd> üëÅÔ∏è
[1:15:51] <Sigma_190_Beta> But Pat, you can now damage the Emmi :)
[1:15:54] <SlangPunk> They sound like birds chirping‚Ä¶ limesHmm
[1:16:04] <Estuko> monkaS
[1:16:06] <dreamfillah> HMMM
[1:16:07] <%Deft_Thought> ü§î
[1:16:11] <%ShinobiPhoenix> don;t lie to Pat
[1:16:12] <%extradopeness> what was that
[1:16:12] <$OfficerMods> or the super metroid intro
[1:16:17] <GhostKaiju> Does make sense, since this is a Chozo planet
[1:16:25] <redwidow1358> I like how the EMMI have that massive purr to them that you can hear a mile away
[1:16:26] <+jyeowa> metroid was always the best at that slightly unsettling offscreen/in the bg horror
[1:16:31] <SaltyAzteca> only 2?? Wow that sucks!
[1:16:31] <%BoxNavy> thank you
[1:16:33] <tmvct1> got stuck here lol
[1:16:35] <%extradopeness> dig up
[1:16:40] <%ScreamLord> Only sometimes does it do the song
[1:16:47] <buddhistmetal> tbf no fanfare on regular pickups is nice for speedrunners
[1:16:49] <GhostKaiju> Scientist: "ha ha what if we make the robot go chirp" Other scientist: "And Be Unstoppable Killing Machines" Scientist: "Sure"
[1:17:01] <%GarbageNirvana> Missiles are pretty easy to come by tbh
[1:17:03] <homestylewaffles> missiles aren't special enough for the song
[1:17:06] <%ShinobiPhoenix> @SaltyAzteca Small Missles are 2, Missile+ are the 10s
[1:17:07] <$OfficerMods> well thats the think EMMI isn't a kill bot
[1:17:14] <OneThousandTomatoes> teasing
[1:17:14] <%ShinobiPhoenix> Missile Tanks used to be 5s
[1:17:16] <buddhistmetal> @GhostKaiju well birds are evil so it tracks
[1:17:17] <%razielhex> YOU'RE ON MARS
[1:17:17] <$OfficerMods> its just a research drone, something happened to it
[1:17:17] <hassanico2> LAVA TORNADO
[1:17:17] <dreamfillah> oh look its NORFAIR
[1:17:22] <SlangPunk> @saltyazteca Fun fact, in fusion and zero mission you‚Äôd get 2 on hard mode, these new games really wanna make you work for it
[1:17:24] <+BigCoffee> It's insane how the game really wants you to rely on the new counter attack mechanic, it looks like a huge pain
[1:17:24] <zerointelligence000> it's that smash stage
[1:17:28] <%Cozy90> lava reef zone is dope
[1:17:30] <toulon_somberjade> also a long glass tube....

[1:17:40] <hassanico2> mmm nice dip in the lava eh pat? LUL

[1:17:55] <%DrFacilier> whoa, heat is hot
[1:17:55] <%ShinobiPhoenix> on the map, Fire bad areas doors are marked with RED squares
[1:17:55] <dreamfillah> i mean there's a variety of of pew pew enemies and enemies you're better off run-n-countering @BigCoffee
[1:17:56] <%Mekhet09> THEN YOU COULD USE THE FIRE SUIT
[1:17:56] <%Cozy90> literally
[1:17:56] <%ScreamLord> "You are not authorized to use the Varia suit."
[1:17:57] <%HaroldDonchee> fire indeed hot
[1:18:01] <kinkade_77> need red tunic
[1:18:12] <%extradopeness> samus is cool SeemsGood
[1:18:18] <Calek> @ScreamLord or in this game's case "I forgot how to use the varia suit"
[1:18:19] <%CatastropheCorvid> Fuck. I guess I'm buying a Switch.

[1:18:51] <@OfficioPrefectusCorgi> psaBlind psaBlind
[1:18:52] <+LastHazzerd> i prefer just samus losing her powers every game vs someone limiting her abilities due to bureaucracy
[1:19:02] <cherrycottontail> @PlaidisTheNewPlaid chozo omnitool, the GUN.
[1:19:03] <%R3Roundabout> Missed a secret in last room

[1:29:17] <$OfficerMods> not what you were expecting huh?
[1:29:18] <SaltyAzteca> Wall climb?

[1:29:30] <olaksi> spider samus, spider samus
[1:29:30] <Tempmael> metroid can crawl!
[1:29:30] <miucsa51> Spider Samus
[1:29:31] <%ShinobiPhoenix> so I haven't beaten the game, but my obvious question is why do the EMMI have suit power ups
[1:29:31] <+ReallyBigRocks> I want whatever the opposite of a spider magnet is
[1:29:34] <Parapattern> Attracts all spiders to you
[1:29:36] <majindusto> Metroid  can Climb
[1:29:36] <tanarath> KEEP READING
[1:29:36] <Frampis> wow you killed it ez game
[1:29:36] <%twoto858> Now look at the SICK wall climbing animations!
[1:29:37] <%Dakuu75> I sincerely hope chat doesn't spoil anything here. This game is too awesome to be ruined like that.
[1:29:37] <+LastHazzerd> spider sam, spider sam
[1:29:40] <reonome> yo thats cool
[1:29:41] <olaksi> does whatever a spider can
[1:29:41] <mr_mister0> SPODERSAM
[1:29:49] <fusioncell12> Metroid can't crawl but she can sure climb
[1:29:51] <killjoy0025> Well that's cool
[1:29:56] <%ShinobiPhoenix> if the EMMI were made by the Federation, why do they have Suit Power Ups
[1:29:58] <+Kodkiro> She's becoming one of them
[1:29:59] <StarMechV> So Metroid can crawl...ON WALLS
[1:30:08] <miucsa51> Spider sam spiders am radioactive spiders am
[1:30:10] <homestylewaffles> @fusioncell12 metroid only crawls vertically
[1:30:19] <%InternetShis> AW SHIT I'M LATE FOR THE MERTOIDS
[1:30:20] <%ShinobiPhoenix> it's a lot of serious questions i have
[1:30:23] <tmvct1> yep made the same mistake
[1:30:26] <KnivesEve> this is chat. always be weary of spoilers
[1:30:27] <@OfficioPrefectusCorgi> Whole wal
[1:30:30] <%MrBorisMakarov> pat...
[1:30:31] <RayShadow278> @ShinobiPhoenix The feds have had a lot of time to study Samus's suit, they made her power ups for Fusion remeber?
[1:30:38] <%Maids4lyfe> charge shot the door
[1:30:42] <+ReiDuran> WALLS ARE LIARS
[1:30:42] <+pectusumbra> @ShinobiPhoenix they probably pirated the shit out of her suit parts when they cut them off her in fusion
[1:30:43] <fusioncell12> @homestylewaffles unless it's Zero Mission
[1:30:51] <GhostKaiju> @shinobiphoenix Samus' suit is Chozo based, right? Thisnis a Chozo planet with a Federation place. Could be reverse wngineered or someth. I don't know any spoilers or shit, but makes sense to me
[1:30:53] <%razielhex> this map is soclassic
[1:30:54] <majindusto> That is Climbing...Not Crawling
[1:30:54] <+LastHazzerd> amiibo
[1:30:57] <%ShinobiPhoenix> @ShinobiPhoenix right, there's a lot of reasons I am sus of the federation with all this
[1:31:01] <Saltmeisterr> WAIT PAT
[1:31:02] <+LastHazzerd> what do amiibo do in this game?
[1:31:06] <Saltmeisterr> u missed
[1:31:07] <olaksi> she keeps dropping her power ups, not hard to get one
[1:31:08] <Frampis> mentid
[1:31:10] <PlaidisTheNewPlaid> I can't believe that the walls would lie to Jane Metroid like this
[1:31:12] <Frampis> mentoroid
[1:31:13] <homestylewaffles> @fusioncell12 suit 2bulk 2crawl
[1:31:19] <Bek_359> @ShinobiPhoenix I mean, EMMIs can wall-crawl and Samus' suit is basically universally modular, so maybe she took some of the wall-crawly bits from it
[1:31:26] <SlangPunk> @lasthazzerd replenish health and missiles I think
[1:31:28] <@OfficioPrefectusCorgi> you missed the way
[1:31:29] <Manwad> if that thing's the spiderclimb EMMI, will the others be fuckin' freakazoids  what the fuck is the shinespark EMMI gonna be
[1:31:29] <+pectusumbra> @ShinobiPhoenix the feds have cloned metroids and mother brains at this point. they are not good guys
[1:31:32] <Frampis> why can't metroid cralw
[1:31:33] <fusioncell12> @homestylewaffles Exactly
[1:31:35] <+Slushsoup> omg I miss side scroll metroid, been playing Super Metroid on switch now I want to get dread
[1:31:35] <+TheMeromex> no morph ball yet?
[1:31:41] <%ShinobiPhoenix> I am not talking spoliers, literally speculation from Metroid Lore of previous games
[1:31:52] <$StrawberryPantsu> Does this game have one wall jumps?
[1:31:57] <+healnavi> @lasthazzerd Super and Fusion's scripts are written in English with Hiragana subtitles underneath
[1:31:58] <%abelincoln_catpuncher> very interesting no morph ball get
[1:31:59] <redwidow1358> Let me tell you, you're gonna be going for a WHILE before you get that morph ball
[1:32:00] <%ShinobiPhoenix> I haven't beaten teh game yet either, it's litearlly in front of me on my desk
[1:32:01] <Frampis> no spolders
[1:32:02] <@GeneralSCPatton> Note: If the map says ACCESS CLOSED on one side of a door, it will be open forever once you get the other side open.
[1:32:04] <redwidow1358> They really make you wait for that
[1:32:07] <+TaurusOxford> @StrawberryPantsu no
[1:32:09] <+healnavi> it's "Lady" universally
[1:32:12] <@OfficioPrefectusCorgi> up
[1:32:15] <%ShinobiPhoenix> I am just figuring things out as I get to understand more
[1:32:16] <i_chevalier> pat the door
[1:32:18] <%twistedj3ster> door stuck
[1:32:19] <PanicSwytch> They make u work for the morph ball
[1:32:19] <+TheMeromex> what was the reason Samus lost her powers this time? i didnt see the start
[1:32:23] <%cvp5127> up
[1:32:24] <SaltyAzteca> Whenever Morph ball isnt on screen everyone should be asking, where's the Morph Ball?
[1:32:25] <%razielhex> probably gonna be a super missile on that one
[1:32:25] <Bek_359> The Federation has a debatably worse track record than Weyland-Yutani.
[1:32:28] <brachydios777> Chozo made Mother Brain correct?
[1:32:28] <%ShinobiPhoenix> I am VERY sus about the EMMI having your powers
[1:32:31] <Frampis> Other M is not canon
[1:32:38] <InuOblivion> he missed a wall
[1:32:39] <+rbakervv> so dumb and blind
[1:32:44] <Frampis> I was stuck here for a bit
[1:32:45] <%ShinobiPhoenix> The Chozo did make Mother Brain
[1:32:46] <GhostKaiju> @themeromex Got separated from her ship where all the good shit be
[1:32:47] <+pectusumbra> @TheMeromex not entirely clear but samus got choked out by evil chozo at the start
[1:32:48] <Saltmeisterr> u missed it pat
[1:32:49] <InuOblivion> theres a moveable wall pat
[1:32:50] <SlangPunk> @themeromex Some badass chozo kicked her ass and stole her shit
[1:32:50] <pap_pip> you can pull wall with spider thing
[1:32:53] <@Spydurman> LUL
[1:32:53] <fusioncell12> I really like how the map details what certain blocks and doors are
[1:32:55] <+LastHazzerd> @healnavi damn i really can't wrap my head around that word choice then, it feels like the only reason you can't consider it demeaning is because they literally tell you it isn't supposed to be
[1:33:00] <@Spydurman> the ol 'just walk into em'
[1:33:02] <Frampis> the Chozo made ligma
[1:33:11] <fusioncell12> Because of that I never felt the need to use markers
[1:33:16] <%ShinobiPhoenix> and the Federation did COPY Mother Brain  in Metroid Prime 3 and Other M
[1:33:22] <@Spydurman> @Frampis I can't believe they ligma'd balls
[1:33:23] <$StrawberryPantsu> This game looks like Shadow Complex,but you know not shit.
[1:33:30] <i_chevalier> oh no is this turning into mind goblins
[1:33:40] <InuOblivion> PAT you can move walls that have arrows on them when you crawl on them
[1:33:41] <+TheMeromex> ud think after so many times she gets her stuff stolen shed get an insurance policy
[1:33:46] <+healnavi> @lasthazzerd Samus comments on the irony almost immediately in Fusion and has a five minute monologue about it in Other M.
[1:33:48] <$StrawberryPantsu> "Boss Baby Vibes." ect.
[1:33:52] <%Mekhet09> @PatStaresAt I've almost gotten dancer to 80 and I hate the class. I've never hated a class this much.
[1:33:52] <BigChiefBear> The parry is 360* isnt it?
[1:33:53] <Frampis> >Implying Other M happened
[1:34:01] <GhostKaiju> I like how with the Emmi gone, this place is now just immediately overrun with all the creatures
[1:34:05] <jotabranded> let pat find out chat
[1:34:06] <Explodincatz> your stuck down here
[1:34:14] <Tigerols> I love how this game literally ignores Other M. I guess its non-canon now?
[1:34:15] <+Slushsoup> Zero Mission was my childhood
[1:34:15] <%ShinobiPhoenix> it would be messed up if the Federation figured out BALL, considering what Prime 1 said about Pirates trying ot copy BALL
[1:34:26] <InuOblivion> VERY
[1:34:32] <%ShinobiPhoenix> @Tigerols no it doesn't
[1:34:33] <+LastHazzerd> @healnavi i remember Fusion, but i also remember not liking a lot of fusion outside ofthe moment to moment gameplay itself
[1:34:42] <+bugz_munny> Dont try to copy ball
[1:34:43] <$OfficerMods> feds can figure out phazon but ball is straight up bird magic
[1:34:44] <+bugz_munny> its bad
[1:34:48] <%ShinobiPhoenix> Other M is Canon, hated, but canon
[1:34:50] <brachydios777> Remember when they gave Samus fcking high heels?
[1:34:53] <@OfficioPrefectusCorgi> no
[1:34:55] <+pectusumbra> @ShinobiPhoenix I mean making a robot rather than doing it yourself is a good answer
[1:35:00] <$OfficerMods> yeah...
[1:35:06] <%cobalt_phoenix_> @brachydios777 when was that
[1:35:07] <fusioncell12> No this ain't Castlevania
[1:35:14] <$OfficerMods> its a boss door
[1:35:16] <zagoons> it's normal

[1:36:03] <GhostKaiju> YOOOOOO
[1:36:06] <+kofibeens> If there's anything I dislike about this game, it's the sheer number of cutscenes that really feels like it breaks up gameplay, but otherwise it's a good time.
[1:36:07] <%ShinobiPhoenix> but WHERE to hurt it, Pat
[1:36:12] <redwidow1358> Well it's either blood or Kool-Aid, and I doubt they got Kool-Aid on ZDR
[1:36:14] <%twistedj3ster> it's Kraid! /s

[1:36:32] <GhostKaiju> I love its dog barks
[1:36:34] <%TheLemuroid> Can you run on the tial
[1:36:35] <+TheMeromex> aim better, react harder, live like a windrammer as you fuck
[1:36:36] <%Frranky> charge shot on face works too
[1:36:43] <blue8moon> is that it's dad's ribcage in the background?
[1:36:45] <@GeneralSCPatton> This game will make you aim
[1:36:54] <%Deft_Thought> Man, every time they show Samus' visor, I think about another Metroid Prime
[1:36:56] <%captain_thickthighs> you can dodge under its tail
[1:37:00] <%ShinobiPhoenix> no, it has STEATH
[1:37:03] <%ShinobiPhoenix> STEALTH

[1:38:56] <@Ranryu692> Samus is so cool
[1:38:57] <jorniev> SIIICK
[1:38:57] <%Mr_Pylon> YO

[1:39:02] <%Maids4lyfe> MISSLES
[1:39:04] <@GeneralSCPatton> Do all the missiles in cutscenes
[1:39:05] <%Frranky> most bosses have one of those
[1:39:06] <PlaidisTheNewPlaid> Jane Metroid invented CQC??
[1:39:08] <%HaroldDonchee> Samus you're fucking crazy
[1:39:09] <OneThousandTomatoes> shooting during cutscenes Pog
[1:39:10] <RyuuAoi> Pat probably got op before stream or something.
[1:39:12] <%BisoromiBear> gotta shoot the bosses more than twice? dark souls level difficulty.
[1:39:19] <%ShinobiPhoenix> you jump whjen it's CLOSE
[1:39:19] <+tsmasher1000> @razielhex Yeah interactive and you can parry in the cutscenes I'm pretty sure
[1:39:20] <%twistedj3ster> this is like the God of War boss fights
[1:39:25] <+pectusumbra> You can tell they put the effort in to give Samus what she's owed after all this time
[1:39:26] <+TheMeromex> tha body slam looks like something u can parry
[1:39:32] <JetpackMcQuack> cool
[1:39:37] <+tsmasher1000> Samus is so badass in this game
[1:39:37] <%Bluwizard21> @PatStaresAt More Missles PAT

[1:39:47] <A_Classy_Gentleman> To be fair this one did actually bug out and wombo combo me the first time lmao
[1:39:47] <GhostKaiju> Really fun monster design
[1:39:49] <+bloodrune8864> The regular shots literally won‚Äôt hurt bosses by the way
[1:39:59] <%ShinobiPhoenix> a good wall jump over it when it charges is probably the best bet
[1:40:01] <RyuuAoi> Release the goblins, Pat. Misled.
[1:40:05] <redwidow1358> SOME bosses do get hurt by regular shots
[1:40:07] <killjoy0025> This is a pretty fast paced boss fight compared to some Metroid Games

[1:48:19] <PlaidisTheNewPlaid> Goblin Slain
[1:48:21] <$OfficerMods> its six hours game time
[1:48:23] <%ShinobiPhoenix> it's 12 hours
[1:48:24] <$OfficerMods> if you are good
[1:48:26] <%razielhex> super metroid was a 3 hour game
[1:48:30] <InuOblivion> no way is it really
[1:48:30] <+ReiDuran> I mean you could probably beat it real quick if you were good at it
[1:48:32] <A_Classy_Gentleman> Those people are either speedrunners or liars
[1:48:33] <kinkade_77> is it really that short?
[1:48:35] <+temporaryplaceholder> What if you explore and fuck around
[1:48:35] <$OfficerMods> but you gonna be looking at that map for a while
[1:48:35] <Explodincatz> ?? u already beat the first area
[1:48:42] <%ShinobiPhoenix> it's 6 if you're rushing and not paying attention ot trying to enjoy it
[1:48:42] <peachy996> Metroid Fusin was like 3 hours
[1:48:43] <RyuuAoi> Six hours my ass
[1:48:48] <draca23> Metroid games, especially 2D are pretty short
[1:48:51] <+hatok> the six hour thing is incorrect but also people reporting the length have been basing it on the ingame timer which is apparently WILDLY innaccurate and doesn't copunt a bunch of stuff
[1:48:54] <tealo972> its not not six hour
[1:48:55] <%Bluwizard21> @PatStaresAt Admittedly I play a lot of metroid
[1:49:00] <+temporaryplaceholder> zelda's my favorite nintendo
[1:49:00] <RyuuAoi> @peachy996 Not even
[1:49:01] <%solracc25> those people DON'T complete the game
[1:49:02] <A_Classy_Gentleman> I've been playing since 3pm est, it's more than 6 hours lmao
[1:49:05] <PlaidisTheNewPlaid> This is 6 the same way RE2 is 6-8
[1:49:07] <PanicSwytch> The ppl that beat it in 6 hours never collect everything
[1:49:13] <%ShinobiPhoenix> Joey Farris from GameXplain had a 12 hour time on his file
[1:49:13] <tanarath> It's a 6 hour game in the same way that RE is a 2-3 hour game
[1:49:20] <%ShinobiPhoenix> with 99%
[1:49:28] <RyuuAoi> If you're aiming to do it in 6, you probably could.
[1:49:29] <%dapperdoop> chillin
[1:49:35] <SaltyAzteca> LOOK AT THIS CHEAP FIRE
[1:49:40] <olaksi> don't let that jpeg burn you
[1:49:41] <%ShinobiPhoenix> I SAID TAHT, the fire looks bad
[1:49:44] <%razielhex> ship
[1:49:48] <InuOblivion> stonk effect fire
[1:49:49] <dreamfillah> HOLY SHIT HTAT'S A LONG WAY
[1:49:51] <redwidow1358> The in-game timer is way off. Literally a "7 hour playthrough" will show up as 15-24 in your activity log.
[1:49:53] <tylerpyre> because it's half framerate
[1:49:56] <%ShinobiPhoenix> actually, yes pat
[1:50:00] <@Ranryu692> LUL
[1:50:01] <+TheMeromex> metroid games are only 6 hours for speed runners and Bee liners
[1:50:01] <mike2hands> Holy shit is HUGE!!!!

[1:50:31] <+ReiDuran> Load times are kinda real in this game.
[1:50:35] <InuOblivion> look at our girl
[1:50:35] <%ShinobiPhoenix> Mass Effect elevators
[1:50:37] <%vehementvadr> fly me to the moon...
[1:50:38] <%Monkeyweed21> we need to edit Samus into the EVA elevator
[1:50:38] <%ScreamLord> This makes me double exited for Prime 4
[1:50:40] <SaltyAzteca> Noveria muzak would be hype
[1:50:40] <%solracc25> Loading
[1:50:44] <$OfficerMods> ...
[1:50:46] <$OfficerMods> just wait
[1:50:54] <+Sendrak70> The current suit is pretty fucking sick already. Cant wait to see what it turns into
[1:50:56] <+nightmare822> Every area change is about 20 seconds, give or take like 4
[1:50:58] <%ShinobiPhoenix> GRABOIDS
[1:50:59] <tanarath> Light Suit was fantastic
[1:51:00] <+LastHazzerd> lying walls
[1:51:02] <%professionalwitchburner> Light Suit was baller
[1:51:04] <RyuuAoi> Best loading screen
[1:51:04] <%ospreyworks> I genuinely think this is her best suit, aesthetically
[1:51:07] <Nitesco> Phazon suit was so edgy and cool Kreygasm

[1:51:32] <JehutyVer2> Phazon suit tho Kreygasm
[1:51:35] <+LastHazzerd> oh neat
[1:51:46] <%ShinobiPhoenix> them and these other particular enemies later were DICKS
[1:51:50] <fusioncell12> I didn't realize you could parry those robots
[1:51:51] <majindusto> DANGER NOODLES
[1:52:04] <Saltmeisterr> Adam ResidentSleeper
[1:52:12] <redwidow1358> You can parry anything that does the flashy click
[1:52:16] <%ShinobiPhoenix> I won't say waht it is, but there's an enemy pretty soon that can shoot you through walls and floors
[1:52:22] <SaltyAzteca> SOUNDS LIKE VARIA
[1:52:28] <Skelegon> tomodachi life voice systems
[1:52:32] <%dapperdoop> but items tho
[1:52:32] <%Cthulhu135> I spent HOURS looking for that hidden wall, I think I'm the big dumd
[1:52:33] <%demiiluna> "What if I want to do a sick Sequence Break"
[1:52:36] <tanarath> Then you die
[1:52:37] <RyuuAoi> Adam is such an asshole
[1:52:43] <AKW4RD_BUFF4LO> Hey everybody! Hope it‚Äôs a great day for everyone!
[1:52:47] <%dapperdoop> don't need varia if you're brave enough
[1:52:47] <CriticKitten> Shut up Adam, you're not my real dad! :(
[1:52:48] <%professionalwitchburner> Oh Varia Suit, what would we ever do without you
[1:52:50] <majindusto> Speedruns go Lava
[1:52:55] <+TheMeromex> splinter cell time
[1:52:57] <brachydios777> We know Adum
[1:53:03] <BigChiefBear> So ADAM is the devs giving you hints in game lol
[1:53:17] <%KeiganOfAstora> Do you wanna beat this in one sitting?
[1:53:25] <RyuuAoi> @bigchiefbear Usually
[1:53:26] <peachy996> I feel bad Adam's talking so much but clearly he needs to if players are saying its so hard
[1:53:31] <fusioncell12> @redwidow1358 I'm so used to Samus Returns where enemies charge at you
[1:53:37] <%ShinobiPhoenix> @PatStaresAt The Meter recharges by movement fast, just don't do it when EMMi is around
[1:53:38] <$OfficerMods> samus i'm not fucking around these robots are bad news bears
[1:53:40] <scarman125> I really don't think this is a one sitting game
[1:53:43] <redwidow1358> Adam is the devs going "This is how this works, this is how you avoid getting your ass blown out" lol
[1:53:46] <peachy996> Then again Adam the AI always was a chatterbox
[1:53:47] <+temporaryplaceholder> Gotta re-re-research ball tech
[1:53:55] <BigChiefBear> @KeiganOfAstora I always beat it when im sitting
[1:54:03] <+temporaryplaceholder> You can't just come out the pussy knowing how to ball
[1:54:07] <+JaxSolace> Im at the clean up phase  and im 11 hours in
[1:54:08] <+bugz_munny> I am so stubborn against the EMMI lol
[1:54:13] <%dapperdoop> are those aeion bugs? I feel like they were in samus returns
[1:54:21] <+bugz_munny> I wanna go fast but emmi wont let me
[1:54:27] <%ShinobiPhoenix> I always try to turn off my Cloak when EMMI leaves the screen and then recharge quickly before I move on

[1:54:28] <fusioncell12> @redwidow1358 Not actively interrupting an enemies ranged attack with a parry
[1:54:33] <SaltyAzteca> Ive never seen walls lie so much
[1:54:39] <%KeiganOfAstora> @BigChiefBear thats hot
[1:54:49] <tangowulf> This game is filled with little contextual animations and poses for Samus. If you stop her in front of a wall, she'll brace herself against it. It's even different for walls/holes.of different heights
[1:55:08] <%twistedj3ster> I miss the morph ball so much right now, I'm shaking
[1:55:08] <InuOblivion> walleyes real/lies
[1:55:17] <%professionalwitchburner> You gotta Shinespark before you can Morph Ball so that you can Shinespark Morph Ball Kappa
[1:55:18] <%ShinobiPhoenix> but yeah, I didn't notice the game was 60 frames
[1:55:18] <%ScreamLord> Convenient how all the control mechanisms are designed to have your gun jammed into it
[1:55:24] <+temporaryplaceholder> Rad
[1:55:29] <brachydios777> Isn't Samus 6,5 ft?
[1:55:36] <%ShinobiPhoenix> it was moving so smooth, this game makes it hard to go back 30 fps Metroid
[1:55:40] <homestylewaffles> @ScreamLord glorious arm-gun based future
[1:55:43] <+temporaryplaceholder> Samus is the coolest
[1:55:44] <Dr00_PhD> 6"3

[1:56:01] <peachy996> How to open door? SHOOT IT
[1:56:01] <%twistedj3ster> kill the Megadeus
[1:56:02] <%professionalwitchburner> The Virgin Keyblade vs the Chad Key Armcannon
[1:56:05] <PwnyB> I mean... they are eagle people, right?
[1:56:10] <InuOblivion> i mean look at those legs
[1:56:13] <$OfficerMods> in the metroid universe steve jobs worked for smith and wesson
[1:56:15] <+ReallyBigRocks> Fun fact: the Russians are the ones who brought a gun to the ISS
[1:56:18] <+TheMeromex> can u parry the little balls? like footballs
[1:56:28] <@GeneralSCPatton> Designed by OCP, creators of Delta City, where USBs are shivs
[1:56:31] <%baka_sugoi> must KILL
[1:56:31] <%hat_under_bread> It's good video game logic. You already have a sword hit thing with sword to operate. You already have a gun? Shoot thing to operate it.
[1:56:33] <%Bluwizard21> well
[1:56:33] <Saltmeisterr> KILL
[1:56:34] <+luketrapwalker> SHE LOOKS SO COOL

[1:56:41] <DrStinkers> She doesn't afraid of anything
[1:56:42] <InuOblivion> DA BABY

[1:56:43] <+bugz_munny> the baby
[1:56:45] <Parapattern> Speaks only in the language of murder
[1:56:47] <redwidow1358> The baby
[1:56:48] <$OfficerMods> the only time samus ever does talk is to say "dude wtf adam"
[1:56:48] <RyuuAoi> Nice suit too
[1:56:48] <runewalker01> That's just female Doom Guy though
[1:56:49] <%BisoromiBear> kill and power stance, what more do you need?
[1:56:52] <$OfficerMods> other m isn't canon

[1:57:43] <%shiplord13> He was  killed by Other M
[1:57:43] <%ScreamLord> Wouldn't mind Nintendo taking another shot at a 3rd person character action Metroid but with controls for a human and a good story

[1:57:49] <SaltyAzteca> Fire indeed hot
[1:58:02] <%hat_under_bread> I like that the creator of Other M is just like "yeah, this is the game I envisioned."
[1:58:03] <RyuuAoi> Naw! OTHER M HAPPENED ON THE WII. The most legitimate Nintendo console. Tell me I'm wrong.
[1:58:03] <olaksi> people play ninja theory but everything wrong with other m became from the original metroid guy
[1:58:04] <BigChiefBear> the world be an enemy too
[1:58:07] <fusioncell12> The environmental damage increases with exposure

[1:58:49] <%ShinobiPhoenix> @ScreamLord I was thinking about if they actually did a better DMC ish character action game for Metroid
[1:58:51] <%abelincoln_catpuncher> so many Other M defenders in the chat lol
[1:58:57] <%professionalwitchburner> Other M is SUPER canon but also SUPER ignored
[1:59:02] <%Bluwizard21> @PatStaresAt Final boss was the only boss I had trouble with
[1:59:06] <fusioncell12> I thought Other M controlled well for the most part
[1:59:10] <Explodincatz> its kinda a long fight for a first real boss
[1:59:10] <+ReiDuran> All the boss fights in this game are fucking awesome
[1:59:12] <%BisoromiBear> that's the burden of a gaming god
[1:59:16] <%ShinobiPhoenix> not much happens in Other M that matters other than the lore
[1:59:16] <devanmuse> What boss fight? i missed the first chunk of stream.
[1:59:19] <%Cozy90> what does the ammibo do?
[1:59:21] <+TheBitingIrish> I would love to see other badasses in the Metroid universe, besides Samus
[1:59:23] <JTEIO> isnt fusion the canon one
[1:59:26] <Vertigheist> other M is the waluigi of metroid, people only root for it because it sucks
[1:59:27] <Skelegon> what do you expect journalists are bad at the video games
[1:59:28] <%Ashrox117> Patroid

[1:59:31] <%ShinobiPhoenix> the stuff about Ridley is actually sick
[1:59:31] <%dapperdoop> there's definitely some toughies in here I think

[1:59:35] <@GeneralSCPatton> YOU CAN PARRY THOSE? sbfpSetIn
[1:59:39] <%Bluwizard21> glad there's a hard mode
[1:59:43] <+TheMeromex> how is that not a lootable chest!?
[1:59:48] <Dr00_PhD> @TheBitingIrish prime 3 had a few cool ones
[1:59:52] <%ShinobiPhoenix> like I straight up expect Ridley in this game some how
[1:59:53] <+bugz_munny> yeah anything that flashes
[2:00:01] <+temporaryplaceholder> C'MON BABY HOT HOT HOT
[2:00:03] <Tigerols> they clearly don't consider it a part of the 2d games storywise, the opening loredump completely ignored it
[2:00:06] <fusioncell12> @dreamfillah My biggest problem with it is the first person mode
[2:00:07] <%professionalwitchburner> @patstaresat Metroid will FAIL unless it gets with the times and releases with a BR

[2:00:28] <%ScreamLord> @TheBitingIrish We got 3 of them in Prime 3. Samus killed them
[2:00:32] <tangowulf> Was that a giant Chozo hanging in the background of the tube room?
[2:00:34] <olaksi> it's canon in the same way dmc2 is
[2:00:37] <%PlatinumAvacyn> PlatinumAvacyn subscribed at Tier 1. They've subscribed for 3 months! hhhhhhhi

[2:01:19] <%Agami23> cutscene samus feels like cutscene dante in how she shows you what to do while being cool as fuck
[2:01:21] <redwidow1358> This one can fit through small spaces
[2:01:22] <PlaidisTheNewPlaid> It can crawl
[2:01:22] <%ospreyworks> God the sound design for these things
[2:01:24] <+LastHazzerd> Emmi venti
[2:01:25] <%ScreamLord> The way they move is so creepy
[2:01:31] <%ShinobiPhoenix> they CAN AND WILL DROP from anywhere htey want
[2:01:34] <%ospreyworks> I fucking love how they beep boop
[2:01:37] <%KeiganOfAstora> What's EMMI stand for?
[2:01:37] <%professionalwitchburner> I can already tell that's the Morphy Morph EMMI
[2:01:40] <%ShinobiPhoenix> I learned that the hard way
[2:01:41] <InuOblivion> Emmi music so spooky
[2:01:44] <cat5kable> !uptime
[2:01:44] <@Moobot> @cat5kable I've been playing this game for how long? Oh only 2h 1m.
[2:01:46] <tangowulf> So the makers of this game must have been huge fans of the late 90's Sci Fi flop "Red Planet"
[2:01:47] <kinkade_77> im not in love with the colors they chose for them
[2:01:54] <majindusto> GEMMI
[2:01:57] <%ShinobiPhoenix> @KeiganOfAstora they say it in game and on the internet, but it's long
[2:02:02] <fusioncell12> @dreamfillah That's fair, I think the nunchuk would have helped
[2:02:06] <%KeiganOfAstora> I'll look it up
[2:02:11] <+D00msDayDan> @KeiganOfAstora Expressly Made for Metroid Impalement
[2:02:16] <%hat_under_bread> Just in case you weren't creeped out enough.
[2:02:18] <tangowulf> @keiganofastora Short for Emily
[2:02:34] <KasiCrafter> It's so refreshing to see the player character be COMPETENT when we're not controlling them
[2:02:34] <%ShinobiPhoenix> @KeiganOfAstora ok, that's strong
[2:02:34] <InuOblivion> WOW
[2:02:39] <%KeiganOfAstora> "An Extraplanetary Multiform Mobile Identifier, or E.M.M.I., is a very powerful Galactic Federation operative robot."
[2:02:44] <%ShinobiPhoenix> NOT SMART DODGING
[2:02:44] <chancho4tierra> Lets ask the real questions, how the people/criatures here went to work?
[2:02:47] <%polothegreatest> ded
[2:02:52] <%echobee_tv> Gotta red parry that
[2:02:55] <akitanito> you got pinged
[2:02:58] <tanarath> 99% a bad idea
[2:02:59] <InuOblivion> he wanted those samus boobas
[2:03:01] <%TheLemuroid> I just realized they are probably after you because of the Metroid DNA
[2:03:06] <dK_kay> this music is making me feel not good
[2:03:10] <+LastHazzerd> yeah it is~
[2:03:10] <kragor__> it's like, 1 frame with random timing or something insane like that
[2:03:11] <huskarl_zap> Lime green? ORKTOBER! SMOrc SMOrc SMOrc SMOrc
[2:03:11] <+Jake_from_State_Farm> aww yeah (pea)cocktober baby
[2:03:13] <%ShinobiPhoenix> you have to smart dodge with stealth in this game, it's crazy
[2:03:19] <devanmuse> "i am a genius" "oh no! "
[2:03:20] <%vehementvadr> I wonder if the emmi just panics when it ran into nothing
[2:03:22] <+silentblast93> why is samus doin preadtor noises while cloked
[2:03:23] <%dapperdoop> who designed these creepy things to be literally invincible
[2:03:24] <RyuuAoi> Laser to the face. You all saw it!
[2:03:31] <SaltyAzteca> THE RED PARRY
[2:03:35] <@GeneralSCPatton> They did a great job of making EMMIs unpunkable. You will never clown on them like the SA-X
[2:03:35] <+LastHazzerd> geezus
[2:03:37] <%ShinobiPhoenix> they can climb celings and and they drop randomly where teh ywant
[2:03:46] <+bugz_munny> actually better than me lol
[2:03:50] <%ShinobiPhoenix> I have jumped over so many EMMIs trying not to die
[2:03:54] <+tsmasher1000> EMMIs are great
[2:04:06] <%nichos7> I really enjoy their areas, yeah
[2:04:11] <+tsmasher1000> The fact that they have different timings for parry is awesome. Really keeps the tension up
[2:04:12] <%KeiganOfAstora> Damn it's fast
[2:04:12] <+bugz_munny> I am retarded against EMMIs
[2:04:12] <%Fooguwu> I WILL GIVE YOU... DISS PEAR
[2:04:14] <%polothegreatest> LUL
[2:04:14] <%ShinobiPhoenix> you can turn your stealthg back on and get away from your own Sonic
[2:04:17] <TehMud> Dang Metroid got a white suit now he's a pretty cool robot.
[2:04:19] <+bugz_munny> they are my kryptonite
[2:04:21] <%nichos7> And they keep getting scarier too
[2:04:22] <conchthechimera> swiggity swooty emmi comin for dah booty
[2:04:22] <InuOblivion> STRESSSSSSSS
[2:04:24] <+LastHazzerd> whew
[2:04:24] <@Ranryu692> well done LUL
[2:04:40] <%ShinobiPhoenix> if you leave a sonic marker, turn on Cloak and hide away from where you left it
[2:04:41] <kragor__> the EMMIs are so fun
[2:04:44] <%Cozy90> Pat doesnt like things on his ass
[2:04:53] <Explodincatz> saving is this is so slow
[2:04:54] <dreamfillah> can't wait to see a speedrun of this game
[2:05:14] <redwidow1358> Really the walls are more like suggestions
[2:05:14] <+tsmasher1000> Speedrun of this game is going to be so sick
[2:05:15] <primarch_lupercal> theyre pretty generous with checkpoints so its fine
[2:05:16] <%ShinobiPhoenix> the EMMI will check the sonic marker location, but not be able to sense you since you moved away from it
[2:05:27] <Shwepie> I love that uncovered blocks stay uncovered.
[2:05:27] <%ShinobiPhoenix> as long as you move away from where they will check
[2:05:45] <@GeneralSCPatton> Finessed
[2:05:49] <+LastHazzerd> you are real quick on the cloack there pat
[2:05:51] <+bugz_munny> YOU CAN PARRY THAT?
[2:05:54] <+bugz_munny> fuck me
[2:05:54] <InuOblivion> VERY Slick
[2:05:59] <majindusto> The EMMI theme is so unsettling enigmaS
[2:06:04] <ammobasket> What a thrill
[2:06:10] <%ShinobiPhoenix> you can parry any flashing attack
[2:06:16] <%Ashrox117> Need timestop
[2:06:20] <%ShinobiPhoenix> but some don't flash, so don't try it
[2:06:25] <$apolitenoob> That's a messed up secret room
[2:06:28] <fusioncell12> @bugz_munny I didn't know that until this stream too
[2:06:30] <+bugz_munny> probably need time stop
[2:06:45] <zagoons> activated the wall rubbing machine, for rubbing walls
[2:06:46] <%that__tj> just finished the game, holy shit. Might be my new favorite Metroid Game
[2:07:05] <%ShinobiPhoenix> there's a particular enemy that I found, parry was the only thing that saved me
[2:07:10] <%that__tj> also hey hello hows everybody doin
[2:07:13] <cthulu_fearlock> I wish missile activated buttons were a thing in life
[2:07:15] <InuOblivion> that was dumb the fly caught you in the middle of that parry
[2:07:32] <+dmbender> ive never played metroid but im kinda interested in this game. Should I go back and start from the beginning?
[2:07:47] <%Mr_Pylon> yeah
[2:07:48] <kragor__> yes

[2:08:23] <+superkeaton> Gotcha, to @PeachSaliva
[2:08:25] <%hat_under_bread> Metroid is good until you hit a part where the way forward is hidden in a really bullshit way. And they've been fixing that.
[2:08:26] <Zebroneath> Nice

[2:08:28] <SlangPunk> @dmbender zero mission, samus returns, super, fusion. That‚Äôs all you need to catch up for dread but the prime trilogy is great as well

[2:08:29] <brachydios777> Was curious on how tall the big 3 sci-fi video game heros were, Chief is tallest at 7 ft, apparently Doom Guy is close at 6'8 ft, and Samus at 6'3 ft
[2:08:29] <%professionalwitchburner> The thing is, Metroid's been good from the start
[2:08:30] <PlaidisTheNewPlaid> Straight to his butt
[2:08:31] <@Ranryu692> he has bad brand synergy
[2:08:32] <redwidow1358> You don't need to go from the beginning necessarily, but at least play a couple before this one. It's best to go Zero Mission, Samus Returns, Super, and Fusion @dmbender
[2:08:32] <$OfficerMods> echos is the best prime
[2:08:33] <peachy996> Who'd have thought all Nintendo had to do was make a GOOD Metroid game instead of Federation Force?
[2:08:33] <$OfficerMods> fight me
[2:08:36] <$OfficerMods> baby
[2:08:39] <Explodincatz> theres only like 3 Woolies
[2:08:40] <+MajorCrasher> honestly other M isn't that bad. people act like the game is the worst one ever made but it just has a bad story
[2:08:41] <RyuuAoi> Pat didn't play Fusion.
[2:08:42] <peachy996> Huh. Weird
[2:08:42] <%KeiganOfAstora> @PatStaresAt Wouldn't it be funnier to spam Matt just to bug him?
[2:08:43] <+tempestzephyr> Send your complaints to Plague
[2:08:46] <%that__tj> @PatStaresAt how many times did you get punked by EMMI so far?
[2:08:46] <PwnyB> Woolie about to get some dissertations while he's out flying mad kites.
[2:08:47] <%Ashrox117> How could Woolie promote such incendiary takes

[2:08:51] <Skelegon> mr baby won't play super metroid
[2:08:53] <%ShinobiPhoenix> Echoes is the only main Metroid I haven't finished becasue I can't play my Prime Trilogy
[2:08:55] <%Fooguwu> @Ranryu692 Woolie believes in anti-branding
[2:08:56] <%Dakuu75> wrong
[2:08:56] <$OfficerMods> its also a bad metroid
[2:09:07] <@GeneralSCPatton> Send it to @WooliesAss on Twittstagram+
[2:09:08] <+bassforte123> Manual aim missiles is terrible
[2:09:08] <+ReiDuran> The fact that you play the game with a SIDEWAYS WIIMOTE
[2:09:09] <dreamfillah> Not using the nunchuck is absolutely asinine
[2:09:10] <%Fooguwu> one time woolie did something good for his business and it made him vomit
[2:09:13] <+CelestialLancer> Everything about 1st person mode in that game is trash.
[2:09:13] <+ReiDuran> Giving you like NO fucking buttons
[2:09:17] <$OfficerMods> also 3d action game on a dpad

[2:11:05] <%ShinobiPhoenix> you can move and jump under cloak, so move away from where they WILL look under cloak to make them stop
[2:11:10] <IntenseNerdRage> E.M.M.I is such a great follow up to the SA-X
[2:11:14] <+Gorgodrn> If they were to port Samus Returns to the Switch, it'd be an automaticimprovement
[2:11:19] <%KeiganOfAstora> spooky
[2:11:21] <%that__tj> Totally
[2:11:22] <%ShinobiPhoenix> at this point, I now CLOAK
[2:11:24] <%KeiganOfAstora> It's Mr.X
[2:11:24] <+ReiDuran> yep
[2:11:25] <jotabranded> way better
[2:11:26] <SaltyAzteca> yup
[2:11:27] <%nichos7> Pretty much
[2:11:27] <IntenseNerdRage> Yes
[2:11:28] <%ShinobiPhoenix> EMMI is just Mr. X
[2:11:29] <brachydios777> yep
[2:11:30] <kragor__> yeah
[2:11:30] <+LastHazzerd> yes
[2:11:31] <redwidow1358> EMMI is SA-X but good
[2:11:33] <@GeneralSCPatton> @razielhex There is a single unit of Omega Kill Juice in each EMMI zone. Getting to it is part of the challenge.
[2:11:33] <LoneFonte> pretty much
[2:11:36] <+bassforte123> The SA-X is sorta like a set piece so this is a way more organic fleshed out version
[2:11:37] <+LastHazzerd> they improved on the SA-X's concept
[2:11:38] <%Kurgash> The Emmi chases are the adrenaline of evading the SA-X
[2:11:38] <+pectusumbra> similar principle yeah
[2:11:39] <+Ardailec> Pretty much, but more aggressive
[2:11:40] <@Ranryu692> Mr. SA-X
[2:11:40] <%abelincoln_catpuncher> closer to Mr X imo
[2:11:41] <InuOblivion> you can slide and shoot? thats cool
[2:11:42] <miucsa51> mr x
[2:11:42] <%that__tj> Its a better SA-X in my opinon
[2:11:42] <%polothegreatest> 2 BIG SHOTS KILLS
[2:11:44] <%ShinobiPhoenix> it's RE2Make Mr X
[2:11:44] <%JoshManVGH> Yeah but evolving
[2:11:45] <dreamfillah> I was doubtful whether they could nail the SAX/Alien energy, but it's working pretty good so far
[2:11:46] <SunsetJack> SaX has long range and can freeze you.
[2:11:48] <%twistedj3ster> Liam danced circles around it
[2:11:48] <%Fooguwu> Pat look out! Robots!
[2:11:51] <Shwepie> SA-X was highly scripted and only had one, small chase sequence.
[2:11:51] <tangowulf> Yeah, the SA:X only popped up 2-3 times,
[2:11:52] <@Ranryu692> Epic SA-X Guy
[2:11:56] <%Dakuu75> Aw-man, I can't wait till Pat gets to the part where- <redacted>!
[2:12:06] <fusioncell12> The S-AX was more scripted
[2:12:06] <Heyestus> These are less imposing than the SA-X I'd  say. They're  slower and melee focused.
[2:12:08] <@GeneralSCPatton> Much better than SA-X because E-Tanks don't nullify the danger and they're not scripted.
[2:12:08] <LoneFonte> Sus room
[2:12:18] <%KeiganOfAstora> Do room's not have names like they did in Metroid Prime?
[2:12:20] <IntenseNerdRage> SA-X was scripted in where you meet them, E.M.M.I just has a large area but can be anywhere
[2:12:21] <%ShinobiPhoenix> if SAX was a real actual stalkers
[2:12:22] <dreamfillah> UHM?
[2:12:24] <+NickHatesSnow> a door duh
[2:12:24] <%nichos7> Some shit

[2:12:34] <zerointelligence000> alien statue thing?
[2:12:36] <miucsa51> KomodoHype
[2:12:37] <%ShinobiPhoenix> I don't know waht it is yet, but it's cool
[2:12:41] <%KeiganOfAstora> Something Chozo related?
[2:12:44] <+LastHazzerd> for a split second everything felt very Axiom Verge
[2:12:48] <%CzeekyTV> was that a FUCKING PARRY
[2:12:48] <Explodincatz> Tbag Ridleys dad
[2:13:00] <%dapperdoop> more hot holes
[2:13:02] <%ShinobiPhoenix> everything Chozo related has cool statues
[2:13:05] <%nichos7> To make you want it
[2:13:13] <%ShinobiPhoenix> the timer continues in the Quest for BALL
[2:13:28] <+TaurusOxford> @CzeekyTV yes, it's a mechanic they brought over from Samus Returns
[2:13:31] <Coystick> Birds are cool. Aliens are cool. Bird  aliens are very cool.
[2:13:36] <+Flunkorg> time to talk to da baby
[2:13:43] <%megadblitz> double marriage
[2:13:44] <+HebbieJebbies> Is Pat covering the stuff in the top left on purpose?
[2:13:47] <%CzeekyTV> @CzeekyTV hot diggity
[2:13:48] <GhostKaiju> The Baby
[2:13:55] <@Ranryu692> so it's a Sentinel
[2:13:58] <Coystick> Emmi my balls lmao goddem
[2:13:59] <%that__tj> still gotta remove the fog of war on every map though, the white blinking doesnt help with that
[2:14:03] <IntenseNerdRage> ACCEPT YOUR HELPNESS
[2:14:05] <%KeiganOfAstora> You a bitch
[2:14:12] <%polothegreatest> theres a hhardmode where u dont see the flash?
[2:14:12] <+HebbieJebbies> Okay ADAM
[2:14:13] <zagoons> fuck off adam
[2:14:14] <%AncelDeLambert> oooooooh okay, I kinda missed that. This EMMI should give me morphball, okay
[2:14:15] <cholesteroid> Yousa bitch
[2:14:16] <%GarbageNirvana> Man Pat is schmoovin' through this game
[2:14:16] <+tempestzephyr> thanks
[2:14:16] <+ReiDuran> It's cool because Adam was always an emotionless machine and now he is
[2:14:20] <+Flunkorg> ACCEPT YOUR HELPLESSNESS
[2:14:21] <%KeiganOfAstora> Resistance is futile by any other name
[2:14:23] <+LastHazzerd> Adam is a bit of a downer at times
[2:14:23] <+MajorCrasher> LUL
[2:14:26] <Saltmeisterr> what the fuck adam
[2:14:28] <+NickHatesSnow> ADAM: Okay listen bitch
[2:14:28] <%professionalwitchburner> ACCEPT YOU LOW TIER STATUS
[2:14:29] <Frampis> You are faced with OVERWHELMING POWER
[2:14:31] <@GeneralSCPatton> They made it so much more mobile, because SA-X was a chonky bitch who couldn't roll
[2:14:33] <GhostKaiju> ADAM NOW IS NOT THE TIME FOR RAW ASS LINES
[2:14:34] <%megadblitz> "ACCEPT YOUR HELPLESSNESS" IS A DAMN GOOD LINE
[2:14:35] <peachy996> This is like if Sovereign was your buddy
[2:14:35] <SaltyAzteca> Thats such an Adam line
[2:14:37] <notgarza> Words to live by
[2:14:43] <%that__tj> Current Objective: SURVIVE
[2:14:44] <fusioncell12> "You have no chance to survive make your time"
[2:14:46] <%ShinobiPhoenix> if I have any complaints, it's that they don't use enough buttons, A doesn't do anything at the point I am
[2:14:47] <CrypticMochi> Sounds like bitch talk Adam
[2:14:48] <%KeiganOfAstora> No sanction, can't arrest them. Must destroy
[2:14:49] <+Sendrak70> I get the strong feeling that adam may be a bad robo-dude
[2:14:49] <miucsa51> Low tier
[2:14:50] <%Nobody404> > you are now authorized to eliminate EMMI
[2:14:52] <+ReiDuran> EXISTENTIAL THREATS.
[2:14:54] <primarch_lupercal> you're giving me an existential threat ADAM
[2:14:55] <IntenseNerdRage> "Listen, even If your a top tier at the end game, THEY WILL FUCKING KILL UOU"
[2:14:58] <%Fooguwu> Only by accepting your helplessness may you become strong
[2:14:59] <%vapelad_dabberb01> adam is cool?
[2:15:00] <miucsa51> Survive Evillak
[2:15:04] <KasiCrafter> ADAM, you said there wasn't any other way besides running BEFORE the Omega Cannon
[2:15:04] <%Dakuu75> Why you gotta be such a downer Adam. Do you have any GOOD news~!!!
[2:15:04] <%ShinobiPhoenix> FUCK THAT THING
[2:15:07] <+gustavozxd> @ShinobiPhoenix beat the game before you say that
[2:15:12] <%extradopeness> its every fucking day with this adam
[2:15:13] <topiodonk> ADAM talking about the cloak so much reminds of all the people screaming SHOOT THE LIMBS in dead space 1
[2:15:17] <LoneFonte> "ACCEPT YOUR HELPLESSNEES" is not something I would expect from a helper AI LUL
[2:15:24] <peachy996> I get an Abe's Odysee vibe off that thing
[2:15:25] <%KeiganOfAstora> @ShinobiPhoenix He said at the point he's at
[2:15:31] <+tempestzephyr> Emi-chan
[2:15:35] <moonwraithdruckmann> @PatStaresAt is this game as bad as people are saying?
[2:15:35] <%nichos7> It's the same area, in fact
[2:15:36] <tangowulf> Adam isn't calling you "Lady" anymore. it's making me suspicious
[2:15:38] <%extradopeness> yeah idk why people hate adam
[2:15:44] <+Gorgodrn> She is animated so well in this game
[2:15:44] <%ShinobiPhoenix> @ShinobiPhoenix I said at the point I am
[2:15:48] <%KeiganOfAstora> Nooo
[2:15:51] <redwidow1358> Each EMMI you encounter will be THE EMMI you encounter until that one has been successfully murked.
[2:15:54] <peachy996> People hated Adam because of Other M
[2:15:57] <%that__tj> punked
[2:15:58] <%silvery_cricket> F
[2:15:58] <%KeiganOfAstora> It wants your DNA
[2:15:59] <%dapperdoop> keek
[2:16:00] <%AncelDeLambert> it's so HARD to parry
[2:16:01] <%Fooguwu> yeah kick it samus
[2:16:02] <$StrawberryPantsu> BORK
[2:16:03] <IntenseNerdRage> I do love that your given two chances
[2:16:03] <+ReiDuran> JUST RED PARRY BRO
[2:16:05] <BlueSpartan119> it heard you jump on the ceiling
[2:16:10] <%megadblitz> feels like they give samus a kiss of death
[2:16:11] <IntenseNerdRage> Like yes it's hard but GOODLUCK
[2:16:11] <commanderapathy> you cannot be seen my ass
[2:16:14] <%Cozy90> it wants you boom boom kitty
[2:16:14] <miucsa51> Accept it
[2:16:14] <Nel_Annette> "Who's being invisible on MY ceiling?!"
[2:16:20] <+LastHazzerd> @peachy996 my introduction to adam was Fusion and it still kinda rubbed me the wrong way
[2:16:21] <%Buttface_> YOU GET A SECOND PARRY ATTEMPT ON THE OTHER FLASH
[2:16:22] <IntenseNerdRage> I've gotten it once and fuck it's hype
[2:16:22] <%abelincoln_catpuncher> yeah Robo Adam in Fusion Isn't bad
[2:16:23] <%that__tj> i really thing its 3-5 frames
[2:16:25] <+gustavozxd> I parried an emmi I think once or twice in one playthrough
[2:16:27] <%ennui_on_me> this game's basically a Five Nights at Freddy's metroidvania if you think about it
[2:16:28] <fusioncell12> The R button on my Switch is currently wonky, so playing this game can be pretty hard at times
[2:16:33] <tangowulf> @moonwraithdruckmann It has some hard as balls bosses, but otherwise looks pretty excellent
[2:16:35] <%Fooguwu> spacist D:
[2:16:39] <+LastHazzerd> give me a drink bar ten der
[2:16:39] <+CookieCutter007> Give me a drink, bartender
[2:16:40] <akitanito> just j-j-jam that gun in
[2:16:43] <OneThousandTomatoes> !uptime
[2:16:43] <@Moobot> @OneThousandTomatoes I've been playing this game for how long? Oh only 2h 16m.
[2:16:47] <dreamfillah> it's beeeg
[2:16:51] <peachy996> @LastHazzerd I didn't mind Adam back then, he was shady but he helped you in the end
[2:16:53] <+tempestzephyr> Chozo really sounds like a slur lol
[2:16:54] <%ShinobiPhoenix> I will also say I FORGOT you can hold up to flat against the ceiling when you're hanging
[2:16:59] <moonwraithdruckmann> @tangowulf would you recommend it to newcomers even with the difficulty?
[2:17:04] <%extradopeness> the real dread was the metroid we met along the way
[2:17:05] <%Bluwizard21> @PatStaresAt only major items
[2:17:05] <dreamfillah> i like that they pace it out a bit
[2:17:07] <+TaurusOxford> @PatStaresAt They stopped that after Super.
[2:17:09] <brachydios777> twice
[2:17:11] <LoneFonte> It's speedrunner support
[2:17:11] <$OfficerMods> almost like they are making sure its not overplayed
[2:17:13] <@GeneralSCPatton> Robo Adam in Fusion was an absolute bro
[2:17:14] <ExpressNode> Its supposed to fill you with DREAD
[2:17:16] <+Gorgodrn> I miss the Missle Expansion jingles from Prime though
[2:17:21] <%ShinobiPhoenix> flating against the ceiling probably would have saved me
[2:17:35] <+gustavozxd> @moonwraithdruckmann I would, it's not actually that hard, it's just a much faster game than most metroid games
[2:17:36] <tangowulf> @moonwraithdruckmann I'd recommend tracking down the older games in the series first and seeing if you like it
[2:17:37] <devanmuse> I'm surprised he still doesn't have the morph ball yet
[2:17:55] <%that__tj> morphball is super late lol
[2:17:56] <%vexion_smh> I think since Zero Mission they didn't have that fanfare over every item
[2:17:57] <%ShinobiPhoenix> @devanmuse SO WAS I
[2:18:05] <+Iggysteve> BillyApprove
[2:18:08] <%abelincoln_catpuncher> I hope Fusion gets more recognition because of how amazing Dread is
[2:18:11] <%extradopeness> this game needs more talk about THE BABY
[2:18:11] <%dapperdoop> probably cause they added the slide
[2:18:13] <%ShinobiPhoenix> the timer to get to BALL was interesting
[2:18:13] <+JustToWatch> Pat we need some Zangief on camera
[2:18:19] <+gustavozxd> morph ball is really late, it's pretty cool
[2:18:26] <+LastHazzerd> every Metroid needs a "time to morphball" measurement
[2:18:27] <redwidow1358> Morph ball takes a long while to get
[2:18:31] <zerointelligence000> Pat what?
[2:18:32] <%Monkeyweed21> that lave looks really bad lol
[2:18:34] <GhostKaiju> Would give a lot of mobility against EMMI, so probably why they're saving it
[2:18:34] <mrethanclifford> So does Pat like Dread so far?
[2:18:37] <@GeneralSCPatton> DEHOTTENING THE HOT ROOMS
[2:18:41] <Estuko> Samus: I'm feeling some serious Metroid Dread‚Ñ¢ right now
[2:18:47] <+LastHazzerd> the lack of the morph ball in this game so far makes it even more tense
[2:18:52] <%that__tj> Out cold the hot room
[2:18:58] <%ShinobiPhoenix> Metroid 1 was like 2 seconds to BALL
[2:19:01] <InuOblivion> those rooms needed some milk
[2:19:02] <%that__tj> AGAIN?
[2:19:03] <%KeiganOfAstora> Just when you were having fun
[2:19:04] <%ShinobiPhoenix> that's TWO
[2:19:04] <%that__tj> WOW
[2:19:04] <redwidow1358> I now judge Metroid games entirely on the time from start to morph ball, meaning Metroid is the best because it takes the longest.
[2:19:06] <%nichos7> Nice
[2:19:07] <akitanito> yeyeyy
[2:19:08] <OneThousandTomatoes> Pog
[2:19:08] <%extradopeness> he DID it
[2:19:10] <+gustavozxd> be careful in emmi areas LUL
[2:19:10] <+MajorCrasher> LUL
[2:19:11] <%Buttface_> HE'S NICE
[2:19:11] <%ShinobiPhoenix> FIGHTING GAME FANS FOR THE WIN
[2:19:12] <+LastHazzerd> ESCAPE
[2:19:14] <@GeneralSCPatton> You doned it
[2:19:15] <%vehementvadr> sluck
[2:19:21] <%extradopeness> holy shit!!!
[2:19:22] <%KeiganOfAstora> In Smash Bros. you start with the ball
[2:19:27] <GhostKaiju> TWICE???
[2:19:28] <IntenseNerdRage> E.M.M.I says no to escapes
[2:19:36] <%ShinobiPhoenix> take that SMASH PLAYERS who think it's too hard
[2:19:38] <WillofGame> How's the game so far?
[2:19:40] <%Fooguwu> psaMenace  *menacing beeping* psaMenace
[2:19:45] <%ShinobiPhoenix> parry timing is life
[2:19:49] <+gustavozxd> metroid 1/ZM takes seconds to get the morph ball
[2:19:50] <%ennui_on_me> @WillofGame real good
[2:20:10] <+Gorgodrn> Prime 2 and 3 you start with it
[2:20:12] <%ShinobiPhoenix> Super Metroid takes like 2 minutes to get to Ball
[2:20:19] <%twistedj3ster> they kinda remind me of the Peace Walker pods
[2:20:43] <%dapperdoop> "piece of e"
[2:20:45] <zagoons> pizza heart...
[2:20:46] <%ShinobiPhoenix> I will say this, I got Ball today and it;'s the best BALL ever
[2:20:50] <%that__tj> gather your Heartpieces
[2:20:51] <%polothegreatest> subtanks
[2:20:52] <homestylewaffles> heart pieces
[2:20:55] <fusioncell12> @Gorgodrn You also have the boost ball from the start in Prime 2
[2:20:56] <+LastHazzerd> what if Zelda was robot
[2:20:56] <%RealThiele> E-tank pieces is boo
[2:21:00] <%ShinobiPhoenix> literally the best BALL has ever been
[2:21:09] <Skelegon> weren't those in other m?
[2:21:12] <+Gorgodrn> @fusioncell12 But you lose it
[2:21:20] <+TheBitingIrish> No, that's a whole tank
[2:21:23] <+Gorgodrn> E parts? Yes
[2:21:26] <%ShinobiPhoenix> I don't yet have Bomb, but BALL is PRIME
[2:21:39] <@GeneralSCPatton> Imagine finding a whole entire E
[2:21:41] <+ReiDuran> BALL GOOD
[2:21:43] <+ReiDuran> BALL REAL GOOD
[2:21:50] <%razielhex> BIRD UP
[2:21:52] <Shwepie> Heart Containers is Metroid is blasphemy, but I'm fine with it.
[2:22:01] <Frostydough1> CHOESE
[2:22:01] <%ShinobiPhoenix> Ball with Slide has some tactics
[2:22:36] <%ShinobiPhoenix> and I only learned today that a sliding Parry is the FLASH KICK
[2:22:37] <OpenYourEels4TheNextFeels> what if you shot all three sensors on that big block?
[2:22:38] <fusioncell12> @Gorgodrn It always struck me as weird that you have it at that point.
[2:22:39] <Saltmeisterr> GLOWY
[2:22:55] <%ShinobiPhoenix> Samus will straight up FLASH KICK if you slide and then Parry
[2:22:57] <Saltmeisterr> missed a secret pat
[2:23:05] <+Gorgodrn> @fusioncell12 Guess they kinda wanted to keep some continuity with Prime.
[2:23:09] <homestylewaffles> @OpenYourEels4TheNextFeels egads, you'd need some kind of SPace lAZER for that

[2:23:35] <fusioncell12> @Gorgodrn Like you use the grapple beam briefly in Prime 1's prologue.
[2:23:42] <%twistedj3ster> use your Sonic Amiibo
[2:23:47] <%that__tj> some of these collectables are Hollow Knight Path of Pain level of difficult to get
[2:23:50] <%ShinobiPhoenix> they haven' EVER changed the Speed Booster icon
[2:23:51] <fusioncell12> @Gorgodrn But you never have to use the boost ball that early in Prime 2
[2:23:52] <majindusto> Super Metroid  would have taught you that enigmaKEK
[2:23:56] <$OfficerMods> speed boost on the ceiling? that doesn't make any sense how are you supposed to go fast upwards? What does samus just rocket up in a cool ass spira?
[2:23:57] <%KeiganOfAstora> Big map reveal. Lots of areas to go to
[2:24:03] <+ReiDuran> IT's fine
[2:24:05] <%dapperdoop> I like the critical path in this game I think
[2:24:13] <+Gorgodrn> True
[2:24:14] <redwidow1358> You'll be coming back soon enough
[2:24:14] <SaltyAzteca> Where's Old Man Morph Ball??
[2:24:14] <%ShinobiPhoenix> Metroid is all about getting items from one area to use it to get stuff from other

[2:25:28] <%Cozy90> @Dakuu75  /salute
[2:25:28] <+gustavozxd> it's a part that is yellow
[2:25:29] <+rbakervv> wait and find out
[2:25:32] <WillofGame> This game was developed by Mercury Steam, right?
[2:25:37] <%Buttface_> üëª
[2:25:40] <%RealThiele> orange part Kreygasm
[2:25:40] <+gustavozxd> the icon says ??? so ???
[2:25:42] <%ShinobiPhoenix> fuck those things too
[2:25:44] <cholesteroid> Y00000
[2:25:46] <%ShinobiPhoenix> they have armor
[2:25:48] <+tempestzephyr> that's where the McDonalds is
[2:25:49] <homestylewaffles> @WillofGame ye
[2:25:51] <+TaurusOxford> @WillofGame yes
[2:25:51] <%ShinobiPhoenix> and they are so small
[2:25:57] <%Monkeyweed21> oh no the enemies are going to use an annoying hacking attack
[2:25:58] <%GarbageNirvana> Technodrome?
[2:26:05] <+gustavozxd> orange boomerang
[2:26:06] <%KeiganOfAstora> @PatStaresAt Who knew Metroid was the inventor of the illusory wall?
[2:26:08] <%GarbageNirvana> Are we a ninja turtles now
[2:26:08] <%dapperdoop> >>>>
[2:26:14] <SaltyAzteca> SPEEeeeeEEEEDD
[2:26:15] <%that__tj> just so you know, this is the right direction xD
[2:26:20] <+ReiDuran> time to see if he makes the same mistake I did
[2:26:22] <%that__tj> I got stuck here for a  couple minutes
[2:26:23] <akitanito> no speed no life
[2:26:34] <+ReiDuran> NOPE, he got it
[2:26:37] <@GeneralSCPatton> Floors are lies
[2:26:43] <+ReiDuran> I spent FOREVER looking for the way forward there
[2:26:49] <+uberspeedster> I got stuck there way too long
[2:26:50] <+HebbieJebbies> You... DID IT
[2:27:01] <+gustavozxd> at least the breakable blocks aren't as stupidly hidden as fusion
[2:27:09] <%that__tj> @ReiDuran also went back because you thought this area was still inaccesable? xD
[2:27:18] <%ShinobiPhoenix> someone said they don't know where to go after finding the Speed Booster, but I imagine you could just the map to mark all the Speed Booster Blocks already found and start with that
[2:27:18] <sampsonite_x> That‚Äôs one thing I noticed the whole time in dread. They love to do this kinda thing at the start of areas. Hide the path forward and make it seem like you can‚Äôt do anything yet
[2:27:19] <$StrawberryPantsu> I miss the Hiccup Samus did when she got hurt in Super...
[2:27:20] <+ReiDuran> YEP
[2:27:28] <+ReiDuran> like, I spent a good hour thinking I missed something
[2:27:28] <%ennui_on_me> The fact that the hidden path forward was *right* next to the breakable blocks made me not consider it would be there
[2:27:33] <sampsonite_x> Also I just finished game. It‚Äôs a 10/10
[2:27:33] <akitanito> sonic?!
[2:27:40] <%Buttface_> there are so many cool shine sparks to get all the items
[2:27:54] <%ShinobiPhoenix> booby trap zone
[2:28:08] <%that__tj> @ReiDuran Ouch! Took me like 30 Minutes because i realized that all the other paths BACK were blocked off
[2:28:10] <%ShinobiPhoenix> no parries to him
[2:28:14] <%that__tj> so only way to go was forward
[2:28:15] <sauceboss310> F sugoiAwawa
[2:28:18] <%polothegreatest> psaSmug
[2:28:19] <+CookieCutter007> that's a cool death screen
[2:28:22] <%dapperdoop> missiling everything instead of bombing everything is a nice change of pace for secrets
[2:28:23] <+gustavozxd> I still have 2 areas to get 100% before I do the end
[2:28:38] <+ReiDuran> I thought I missed a breakable block but didn't consider that it could have been the FLOOR
[2:28:44] <+gustavozxd> ah yes, the triangle ability
[2:28:52] <%that__tj> @gustavozxd try to get all E-Tanks...you'll need em
[2:29:01] <%cvp5127> it this a one off?
[2:29:20] <tangowulf> This sounds like boss music
[2:29:21] <%ShinobiPhoenix> I feel like Metroid has only ONCE explained the Triangle Jump
[2:29:25] <%dapperdoop> very stable
[2:29:27] <+ReallyBigRocks> incredibly stable
[2:29:29] <%Monkeyweed21> but you are agressive
[2:29:31] <%that__tj> if pat makes this a long stream he can finish it in one
[2:29:32] <%twistedj3ster> would you eat sandwich triangles?
[2:29:33] <WillofGame> Reject orb, become Triangle
[2:29:33] <%FacetiousAF> they're always 180 degrees
[2:29:33] <homestylewaffles> Triangle Strategy
[2:29:34] <akitanito> what about circles with infinite sides
[2:29:36] <$OfficerMods> wow never thought pat was an illuminati shill
[2:29:36] <+gustavozxd> @gustavozxd I'm just gonna get everything cause it's fun, some of the insane tech you can do for abilities is absolutely insane
[2:29:37] <%ShinobiPhoenix> and literally it was in the first game to have it, Super Metroid
[2:29:41] <brachydios777> Does anyone remember HALOID?
[2:29:42] <cholesteroid> oh this looks evil
[2:29:44] <%Cozy90> what about a rhombus?
[2:29:48] <+vaderxyz1970> I dont know if its just me but does il look like they gave Samus more of a booty
[2:29:49] <zerointelligence000> spoopy
[2:29:51] <+Kodkiro> absolute Halloween
[2:29:51] <Explodincatz> oh god its ghost ship part 2
[2:29:51] <+rbakervv> @brachydios777 i do
[2:29:57] <$OfficerMods> WOW
[2:30:00] <GhostKaiju> monkaS
[2:30:01] <akitanito> rhussy
[2:30:02] <+ALazo> their angles add up to 180, and that's a cool number
[2:30:06] <%RLT917> atpCap
[2:30:09] <karl_rex> Circle is where its at
[2:30:09] <homestylewaffles> leave rhombus alone
[2:30:10] <%ShinobiPhoenix> I have litearlly been waiting for this game to give me a Triangle Jump tutorial
[2:30:10] <%twistedj3ster> rhombussy
[2:30:12] <SaltyAzteca> Rhombussy
[2:30:12] <MisterAngryEyes112> Quadrilaterals DansGame
[2:30:13] <Saltmeisterr> RHOMBUSSY
[2:30:13] <ExpressNode> Rumbling Rhombus
[2:30:13] <aliasz50> they're also the most stable shape
[2:30:14] <%dapperdoop> rhombus is a lazy square
[2:30:15] <+ReallyBigRocks> all my homies hate rhomboids
[2:30:20] <%TubeMan642> Rhombussy
[2:30:20] <%MugenSandan> what about OCTAGON THE BESTAGON
[2:30:23] <%Cozy90> Kappa
[2:30:23] <brachydios777> why?
[2:30:29] <Cobaltor_252> so how's the game so far?
[2:30:33] <%Felhad> Hexagons are pretty cool
[2:30:33] <%that__tj> @gustavozxd the amount of tech you HAVE to do to get the last few collectables. Man, makes Hollow Knights DLC look like a joke
[2:30:33] <Cobaltor_252> ah so its good
[2:30:34] <%KeiganOfAstora> What about an isosceles trapezoid?
[2:30:36] <%nichos7> Yeyeyeyeye
[2:30:44] <%ape_hawk> THATS HOT
[2:30:45] <%Cozy90> THATS HOT
[2:30:46] <Saltmeisterr> Pogchamp
[2:30:47] <Thesomeone96> muffled google
[2:30:47] <%MrBorisMakarov> nice
[2:30:47] <%nichos7> It always is, Pat
[2:30:49] <%RLT917> LUL
[2:30:49] <AngryAsian5> Kappa Kappa
[2:30:51] <%captain_thickthighs> This game really seems like the studio put in there all to make sure this was good
[2:30:51] <+TaurusOxford> It was well hidden. Kappa
[2:30:53] <PanicSwytch> Yay LP
[2:30:54] <akitanito> like
[2:30:56] <%Dakuu75> Siri is an ass-man
[2:31:01] <scarman125> fuck you pat
[2:31:02] <miucsa51> LUL
[2:31:07] <akitanito> why was it up your butt
[2:31:07] <Skelegon> never would have guessed
[2:31:08] <+gustavozxd> @gustavozxd oh yeah, i also love getting abilities before I'm supposed to LUL
[2:31:09] <Polyceramic> pat my google assistant apologised because of that
[2:31:10] <+tempestzephyr> vibrations
[2:31:12] <scarman125> I' watching on my phone
[2:31:28] <tanarath> Stored within the secret pocket
[2:31:34] <%ShinobiPhoenix> so, I admit, this game makes me almost forgive MercurySteam over Lords of Shadow
[2:32:00] <%that__tj> This game is so good
[2:32:04] <%that__tj> all is forgiven
[2:32:11] <%ShinobiPhoenix> if they somehow end up just being Metroid 2D team, and Lords of Shadow was actually Konami being bad, I will forgive them
[2:32:13] <kinkade_77> metroid dread 2 will come out before silk song
[2:32:14] <%abelincoln_catpuncher> hearing how Pat sounds playing this game versus the podcast talking about it was very interesting
[2:32:17] <%BisoromiBear> it's nice when games come out and they aren't shit
[2:32:21] <+gustavozxd> devs learned from their mistakes but still not "forgiven" atpCap
[2:32:50] <%ShinobiPhoenix> Metroid Ssamus Returns had me feeling better about them but DREAD has me pretty much forgiving them
[2:32:57] <%polothegreatest> supervised by nintendo
[2:32:59] <%Felhad> Why does Gief get a drink in the BRB video but Elmo doesn't
[2:33:03] <PanicSwytch> Im still surprised this is from the LoS devs
[2:33:07] <%ShinobiPhoenix> and Mirror of Fate HD is tolerable
[2:33:10] <%Felhad> Give that cat Paige's water
[2:33:23] <%polothegreatest> retro dreaded the shiggy fury
[2:33:27] <%ShinobiPhoenix> it's Lords of Shadow 1 and 2 I won't forgive in general
[2:33:32] <s1rcuit> @Felhad because Gief can't be trusted to DJ
[2:33:36] <+gustavozxd> I wonder just how many people who worked on LoS actually worked on this
[2:33:39] <%that__tj> Man my hand is still shaking from the last boss lol its been an hour already.
[2:33:42] <brachydios777> We can agree the big 3 in videogame sci fi are Chief, Samus, and Doom Guy, right?
[2:33:53] <%ShinobiPhoenix> I literally tried playing them again on my Xbox Series X to see if I still hated them and YES
[2:33:57] <notgarza> I hear lthat‚Äôs hot‚Äù in Broly‚Äôs voice
[2:34:01] <%Felhad> lol
[2:34:14] <s1rcuit> @Felhad the music HAS to keep going, whereas the bar isn't constantly slammed
[2:34:20] <+gustavozxd> lords of shadow 2 was ok, enemy design was a joke but I enjoyed it
[2:34:24] <%ShinobiPhoenix> Lords of Shadow, the games where for some reason you fight Satan
[2:34:29] <+gustavozxd> every enemy does the same thing LUL

[2:35:28] <%bravebravesrobin> sorry for bringing up the Chappelle situation, I just think comedy should be one of those untouche
[2:35:30] <RyuuAoi> No excuse for Pat to not keep playing. He's on a Switch damn it!
[2:35:39] <Shwepie> Wide Beam VoteNay Spazer Beam VoteYea
[2:35:40] <%AncelDeLambert> it's the OLD Wide, too!

[2:35:50] <%Felhad> Wide AF
[2:36:00] <buerdo> Thicc beam
[2:36:06] <RyuuAoi> NO. KONAMI WONT ALLOW IT.
[2:36:08] <kinkade_77> every metroid has a wider gun upgrade
[2:36:10] <Diabetic> @ShinobiPhoenix holy crap..how is that possible?
[2:36:19] <%ShinobiPhoenix> @Shwepie I have to assume Spazer is later because there's electric stuff
[2:36:23] <PanicSwytch> I can't wait to pick this up tmwr
[2:36:38] <%lehvak182> Wide gun for a wide man
[2:36:39] <RyuuAoi> Samus getting upgraded the fuck out in this one! Cloaking!?
[2:36:41] <+gustavozxd> wait until konami rereleases old castlevanias in like 5 other collections and maybe we'll get a sequel
[2:36:41] <%AncelDeLambert> shinespark booooiiiii
[2:36:42] <%ShinobiPhoenix> @Diabetic Samus Returns was good, I was shocked and then this is exceellent

[2:36:46] <%lehvak182> a wide man needs a wide gun
[2:36:46] <Shwepie> @ShinobiPhoenix If Prime taught us anything, that's Wave Beam. :)

[2:37:15] <$mattynezz> So does Pat enjoy it so far?
[2:37:15] <PanicSwytch> Why didn't u use the cloak
[2:37:16] <%ShinobiPhoenix> @ShinobiPhoenix OH RIGHT, that would be Wave
[2:37:18] <%that__tj> Each Emmi has different Timing for the parry btw
[2:37:24] <IntenseNerdRage> Congrats, you've meet Shinespark E.M.M.I
[2:37:27] <AngryAsian5> W I D E
[2:37:28] <LoneFonte> just a little *bonk*
[2:37:34] <RyuuAoi> Pat will NEVER get Shine Spark
[2:37:39] <+TheMeromex> its always funny when u miss the timing, looks like you bitch slapped him and got owned
[2:37:40] <%ShinobiPhoenix> Wave was electric and Plastma was Fire
[2:37:40] <%RealThiele> i wish they just called it spazer
[2:37:43] <+gustavozxd> based on each emmi? I thought it was all just random
[2:37:46] <@GeneralSCPatton> You'll never get used to the EMMI parry
[2:37:46] <tanarath> Pat, use the cloak
[2:37:49] <miucsa51> FAST
[2:37:51] <%ShinobiPhoenix> I wonder how far in Ice is
[2:38:01] <PanicSwytch> CLOAK
[2:38:06] <%ShinobiPhoenix> no, no one say how long until Ice
[2:38:06] <RyuuAoi> Pat failed cloak ha
[2:38:16] <%bravebravesrobin> sorry for bringing up the Chappelle situation, I just think comedy should be one of those untouched mediums that exists unmolested unless it's actually calling for violence Cheer1000
[2:38:19] <%ShinobiPhoenix> my Timer until Ice continues
[2:38:20] <%that__tj> @gustavozxd i think the last 2 are randomized
[2:38:23] <rottingpastry> Pretty sure the way it gets you is just based on where and how you hit it
[2:38:34] <%vehementvadr> I'll cloak ur mom
[2:38:41] <%ShinobiPhoenix> my expectations of getting Ball and Ice early in a Metroid is completely shattered
[2:38:42] <Coystick> Is Samus still a goo girl under her suit post-fusion?

[2:39:28] <%ShinobiPhoenix> btw-- Wide Beam doesn't mean 3x firepower now
[2:39:29] <notgarza> Crazy talk
[2:39:31] <%that__tj> just wanted to show off the cool game over screen
[2:39:34] <+gustavozxd> @RyuuAoi it's confusing tbh
[2:39:35] <%ShinobiPhoenix> does^
[2:39:40] <rottingpastry> Samus is still gooey
[2:39:44] <%ShinobiPhoenix> wide beam means 3X firepower now
[2:39:48] <%Forbidden_Karp> Pat's nemesis, the turret, returns
[2:39:55] <%ShinobiPhoenix> so you are stronger
[2:39:55] <Diabetic> I really wish they'd release the prime trilogy already, I want to play them, though technically I've only beaten Metroid Zero Mission
[2:40:00] <%that__tj> next area XD
[2:40:04] <tealo972> up
[2:40:09] <%that__tj> we done already
[2:40:14] <%Monkeyweed21> @RyuuAoi the Power Suit is literally fused to samus's skin, thats why she dematerializes it to take it off
[2:40:19] <RyuuAoi> @gustavozxd We can agree that she got fucked up though! Her body is fucked. Had to remove the suit like that.
[2:40:20] <Saltmeisterr> U can explore more of cataris now
[2:40:22] <%RealThiele> tiny tanks dont fuck around
[2:40:28] <+gustavozxd> I hope prime 4 doesn't have another "and now go collect a bunch of bullshit" again
[2:40:31] <streamtouched> time to leave
[2:40:33] <%ShinobiPhoenix> I believe you can go back now, you can't seem to do more with this area for now
[2:40:43] <spikeymike> @Diabetic won't happen unless they figure out a way to emulate the wii pointer well enough for prime 3
[2:40:46] <KasiCrafter> Weird how the game put you back at the tram station after getting a new power, huh?
[2:40:51] <+Flunkorg> oh no, pats having a moment isn't he?
[2:40:55] <RyuuAoi> @monkeyweed21 Indeed! Prolly a shit show under there...
[2:41:01] <%ShinobiPhoenix> you can move the 3 eyed blocks with WIDE beam
[2:41:10] <+TaurusOxford> @KasiCrafter almost like it is trying to tell the player something. Kappa
[2:41:12] <%that__tj> Oh yeah you can totally see how her current Suit is just organic fiber with mechanical parts attached to it
[2:41:21] <+ReiDuran> Time to do widebeam stuff
[2:41:23] <%ShinobiPhoenix> the fat blocks that look like circuits with 3 eyes
[2:41:28] <pixelkingu> just finished this game....my god what a ride, its one of the best metroid games in years
[2:41:30] <fusioncell12> @spikeymike Wouldn't the disconnected joy cons work?
[2:41:31] <%dapperdoop> samus is listening to her podcast
[2:41:33] <jman13131313> yrs
[2:41:34] <%that__tj> MAN I LOVE THIS GAME PAT

[2:41:35] <Vivirmos> Yeyeye
[2:41:36] <Dr00_PhD> ye
[2:41:36] <+gustavozxd> I had some crazy fun and I'm not done yet
[2:41:36] <%that__tj> YEAH
[2:41:38] <$OfficerMods> spoiler
[2:41:38] <cthulu_fearlock> yes sir
[2:41:38] <Saltmeisterr> im having fun :)
[2:41:38] <+Flunkorg> Oh yeah
[2:41:39] <+TaurusOxford> yes
[2:41:40] <Ranger747> ye
[2:41:40] <@GeneralSCPatton> Yup
[2:41:40] <tanarath> yep
[2:41:40] <Shwepie> @spikeymike @spikeymike They've already figured that out for Skyward Sword.
[2:41:42] <Saltmeisterr> yes
[2:41:42] <knotsundownsyndrome> kinda
[2:41:43] <$mattynezz> Yee
[2:41:43] <Ape_Law> yes
[2:41:43] <%captain_thickthighs> yes
[2:41:44] <+ReiDuran> Oh yeah
[2:41:44] <brachydios777> yes
[2:41:44] <+gustavozxd> well yeah
[2:41:45] <Dr00_PhD> you do
[2:41:45] <%Monkeyweed21> always
[2:41:45] <%ShinobiPhoenix> I mean you know you are getting at least Varia
[2:41:46] <+Immortalsblade> Yes
[2:41:46] <%Forbidden_Karp> there is a suit section in the equipment panel
[2:41:48] <%RealThiele> yes
[2:41:49] <$EsotericOdyssey> once heard someone describe samus as having "a spaghetti plate of eldritch horror" instead of DNA at this point
[2:41:49] <+JonathLP> It's a metroid game, of course you do
[2:41:49] <PanicSwytch> Yes
[2:41:50] <%ShinobiPhoenix> I don;'t know about the rest
[2:41:50] <+Flunkorg> The fucking coolest suit ever (not joking)
[2:41:51] <$StrawberryPantsu> Different colors
[2:41:53] <%SinnerEbru> is this a goblins episode or just a normal night
[2:41:54] <%RealThiele> oh
[2:41:56] <+slacquerboy> Wait, Pat never had a childhood. Why is he playing this?
[2:41:57] <tanarath> Provably a few, ye
[2:41:57] <miucsa51> yes
[2:42:00] <$OfficerMods> yes you get better armor but don't say anything about the looks chat
[2:42:07] <%ShinobiPhoenix> Gravity Suit rarely comes back
[2:42:13] <knotsundownsyndrome> @SinnerEbru paraphrasing pat, this game rewards the goblins
[2:42:14] <OneThousandTomatoes> ghe whitos?
[2:42:15] <%polothegreatest> nintendo spoiled in trailer i think
[2:42:16] <%that__tj> every Metroid has the Varia and Gravity Suit. Some others depending on the game too but those two are always there
[2:42:20] <knotsundownsyndrome> so no
[2:42:22] <%ShinobiPhoenix> and I don't feel suit ever got as cool as Dark and Light
[2:42:23] <spikeymike> @fusioncell12 too much motion drift it leads to an inconsistent pointer
[2:42:29] <%Monkeyweed21> in Fusion it was the opposite, going from sleek blue and yellow back to the bulky orange
[2:42:42] <+Flunkorg> pat blind?
[2:42:45] <+megaman_sentinel> other zone ?
[2:42:46] <Saltmeisterr> theres wide doors too
[2:42:48] <%Felhad> psaGiefrail psaGiefrail psaGiefrail
[2:42:52] <%SinnerEbru> @knotsundownsyndrome ahhh, copy. thankyou!
[2:42:53] <%ospreyworks> bork bork
[2:43:00] <%polothegreatest> fusion suit in prime MindManners
[2:43:02] <%Mr_pale> @flunkorg yes
[2:43:03] <tanarath> he bork
[2:43:04] <tealo972> wide block and door are different
[2:43:05] <%Felhad> gief mad
[2:43:07] <tangowulf> @esotericodyssey Well, she's a human raised by Chozo infected with X and treated with Metroid, so yeah,
[2:43:07] <%ShinobiPhoenix> @that__tj obviously Metroid 1 doesn't have Gravity, lol
[2:43:08] <KasiCrafter> There's a meme in that Power Doors and Wide Door COVERS
[2:43:15] <tanarath> he protecc
[2:43:17] <Saltmeisterr> room to ur left
[2:43:18] <%that__tj> you can highlight all Wide Doors
[2:43:24] <%that__tj> makes it easier to see
[2:43:24] <%ospreyworks> psaDogchamp psaDogchamp psaDogchamp
[2:43:25] <RyuuAoi> They legit gave up on her suit with Fusion
[2:43:28] <+Flunkorg> No.
[2:43:32] <tealo972> no
[2:43:33] <$StrawberryPantsu> Light Suit Still best suit
[2:43:34] <%ShinobiPhoenix> and I barely remember if Gravity was in Prime 3
[2:43:35] <fusioncell12> @spikeymike I was just thinking since they used it for Skyward Sword maybe it'd work for Prime
[2:43:40] <+rbakervv> does it say wide door?
[2:43:40] <KasiCrafter> Wide doors let you know they're wide
[2:43:42] <RyuuAoi> THE SAMUS YOU REMEMBER IS A LIE.
[2:43:42] <%that__tj> click one, then zoom out
[2:43:43] <+rbakervv> then now
[2:43:48] <+JonathLP> arf
[2:43:50] <cthulu_fearlock> just use the icon you already found
[2:43:52] <rottingpastry> it says wide beam cover
[2:43:55] <+Flunkorg> Omg pat is so close to it
[2:44:01] <majindusto> GIEF MAD
[2:44:03] <Saltmeisterr> warmer
[2:44:07] <tealo972> so close
[2:44:09] <fusioncell12> @ShinobiPhoenix It wasn't. The closest thing was the hazard shoulders
[2:44:12] <%that__tj> havent found many then
[2:44:19] <+Flunkorg> YES!
[2:44:19] <%Felhad> psaGiefrail
[2:44:24] <%crimsonharvest> I feel really railroaded by this game, and also like im hunting a lot of map pixels
[2:44:35] <%that__tj> the game has so many nice QoL features
[2:44:46] <%ShinobiPhoenix> your target should be getting to the CENTRAL BRAIN unity
[2:45:00] <spikeymike> There's a line Adam gives in this game early on that I hope VGAdvisor sees
[2:45:02] <%ShinobiPhoenix> and then you look at the doors leading to it
[2:45:04] <%KeiganOfAstora> So smart
[2:45:06] <akitanito> nice
[2:45:07] <%that__tj> @crimsonharvest at the halfway point the game opens up
[2:45:10] <%ShinobiPhoenix> FGC wins again
[2:45:12] <SaltyAzteca> IDUNNOYOUTHATSMYPURSE
[2:45:14] <+ReiDuran> it feels so fucking good when you counter an emmi
[2:45:28] <%king_wragles> Way more than me
[2:45:29] <%KeiganOfAstora> Yea, I typed that before you parried it. Good shit
[2:45:38] <$StrawberryPantsu> Brother Brain
[2:45:39] <%that__tj> The eye with the Kill Emmi juice
[2:45:45] <majindusto> ANOTHER  BRAIN
[2:45:46] <%crimsonharvest> wow this seems way easier to se and doge the shots on a big screen than in handheld
[2:45:49] <spikeymike> I just realized the omega beam is the omega beam from super Metroid
[2:45:55] <%ShinobiPhoenix> suck brain like Sylar
[2:45:55] <tanarath> 50% of the time, 1% of the time
[2:45:56] <@PeachSaliva> Sorry about Zangief, guys. We are doing what his trainer told us to do and he is mad. :/
[2:45:56] <+ThunderZebraKing> Such hard bosses LUL
[2:45:57] <kinkade_77> watch out for the cheerios

[2:47:20] <majindusto> BALL ACQUIRED
[2:47:20] <s1rcuit> and they stay dead right?
[2:47:20] <toulon_somberjade> ROUND TIME
[2:47:21] <%MisterRockett> It took nearly 3 hours to get the morph ball!?
[2:47:21] <blue8moon> pat throw ball now
[2:47:22] <Zebroneath> that feeling is always great
[2:47:22] <brachydios777> RAD
[2:47:23] <boywunderkind> lesbians can curl into a ball

[2:47:23] <+JonathLP> @PatStaresAt IT"S MORPHIN TIME!
[2:47:24] <+Flunkorg> never been more hyped for BALLS
[2:47:25] <%that__tj> Now all those tiny ledges wont stop you anymore!
[2:47:28] <%RonaldMcDownload> GIEF LOVE BALL
[2:47:30] <%extradopeness> ORB
[2:47:31] <PanicSwytch> BORK BORK
[2:47:32] <%WeLucklessJacks> BOL
[2:47:34] <%KeiganOfAstora> @PeachSaliva What's he barking about anyway? If it's okay to ask
[2:47:34] <+dementedcactus> balllllllls
[2:47:35] <$StrawberryPantsu> It STARTS WITH SPRING BALL?!
[2:47:36] <%MisterRockett> Oh wow this is all of the morph ball shit.
[2:47:37] <RyuuAoi> One of my favorite MJ songs. "Give It To Me"
[2:47:38] <%ospreyworks> how long has pat been playing and roughly how long is this game?
[2:47:42] <tcosmiclatte> spring ball is built in?
[2:47:46] <RyuuAoi> REKT
[2:47:47] <%ShinobiPhoenix> Ball STARTS with Spring ball
[2:47:50] <toulon_somberjade> ooohh as a bonus free SPRING BALL
[2:47:55] <+TaurusOxford> built in springball
[2:47:56] <%Kurgash> He‚Äôs really upset back there
[2:47:59] <cholesteroid> BALL TIME
[2:48:00] <%ShinobiPhoenix> but also you can slide and hit Slide again to BALL
[2:48:03] <+ReiDuran> you can go from slide to ball
[2:48:03] <%vehementvadr> ballet
[2:48:07] <+ReiDuran> it's SO good
[2:48:09] <%DoubleRrico> orb mode aquired
[2:48:14] <CrypticMochi> Biggest balls in the galaxy!
[2:48:15] <%RealThiele> slow morph ball lame
[2:48:22] <+LastHazzerd> the slide into orb requires a double tap
[2:48:30] <%ShinobiPhoenix> you can literally RUN, SLIDE BALL BALL INTO SLIDE AND BACK TO BALL
[2:48:30] <+ReiDuran> hit slide again during slide
[2:48:41] <%dapperdoop> I think it's for like waist high tunnels
[2:48:41] <fusioncell12> @spikeymike I enjoyed it, although the controls aren't great.
[2:48:43] <%ShinobiPhoenix> slide and then slide
[2:48:50] <%ennui_on_me> If you're going into an elevated tunnel you don't have to turn into a ball before hand, you just hop into it
[2:48:55] <%extradopeness> gief screaming from inside baby jail
[2:48:55] <%Ziegsy> that dog really wants to get at paige
[2:48:56] <RyuuAoi> But she's got the biggest balls of them all!
[2:48:57] <devanmuse> time to SCRUB THE MAP for all morph ball spots
[2:49:03] <+Flunkorg> omg you can go back and get all the shinny's
[2:49:09] <+LastHazzerd> whats with the music
[2:49:18] <%ShinobiPhoenix> you can hit slide a third time to UNball in motion
[2:49:24] <Smokin_Fish> is it just me or is the suit sexier?
[2:49:34] <+TheotherKristian> yes
[2:49:35] <%ape_hawk> does samus get cramped like that?
[2:49:37] <%KeiganOfAstora> Yea, you shoulda gotten that for the Morph Ball, that's a major upgrade
[2:49:40] <knotsundownsyndrome> don't fuck the living suit
[2:49:42] <%ape_hawk> ouch
[2:49:44] <%extradopeness> tubes
[2:49:47] <+LastHazzerd> oh sorry, i meant the music that sounded like it played in reverse
[2:49:48] <%ShinobiPhoenix> and I am sure hiding from EMMI will be a thing as BALL
[2:49:49] <spikeymike> @fusioncell12 It was one of my favorite DS games and I actually liked the controls. I really wish Nintendo would remake it
[2:49:49] <%Buttface_> they're the tunnels the EMMI uses
[2:49:51] <%Kurgash> @lasthazzerd it‚Äôs a distorted version of zebes I think
[2:49:55] <rottingpastry> They're the tunnels the EMMI uses
[2:49:56] <knotsundownsyndrome> this hurts you if you fuck the living suit
[2:49:57] <%ShinobiPhoenix> EMMI poke Ball
[2:49:59] <+LastHazzerd> neat
[2:50:02] <Dr00_PhD> these were the tunnesl the emi was chasing you through so yeah
[2:50:10] <+TaurusOxford> @KeiganOfAstora He did get it though...
[2:50:17] <Smokin_Fish> Does the living suit jack masterchief off?
[2:50:18] <%MugenSandan> can you be an invisible ball?
[2:50:22] <%ShinobiPhoenix> @PatStaresAt those are the EMMI Vents
[2:50:27] <%KeiganOfAstora> Man, I'm high... @TaurusOxford lol
[2:50:29] <+gustavozxd> @ape_hawk it's like, techno magic, the space pirates tried to mimick the morph ball and all they got were broken bones
[2:50:30] <fusioncell12> @spikeymike The controls were fine when I was younger but now it kind of hurts to play
[2:50:31] <+LastHazzerd> wonder what speed runs of this game will be like
[2:50:35] <%Kurgash> Literally balls on stream
[2:50:43] <%ShinobiPhoenix> EMMI vents become BALL vents
[2:50:52] <%DoubleRrico> Samus has a counter?!
[2:50:53] <knotsundownsyndrome> i have no brain poower again
[2:50:56] <%ShinobiPhoenix> this guy FUCKS
[2:51:01] <fusioncell12> @spikeymike I do hope the other hunters come back at some point
[2:51:05] <%ShinobiPhoenix> if you don't counter, he fucks you up
[2:51:07] <brachydios777> Ground Wave!
[2:51:09] <+TaurusOxford> @KeiganOfAstora I feel like there should be a warning against watching Pat while high. Kappa
[2:51:11] <+gustavozxd> @DoubleRrico since samus returns on the 3ds
[2:51:16] <+LastHazzerd> okay where is the lie
[2:51:18] <spikeymike> @fusioncell12 agreed
[2:51:18] <+Jack8274> mmm the parry feels sexy
[2:51:26] <+gustavozxd> the parry in this game is crazy satisfying
[2:51:26] <%DoubleRrico> last one i played was prime
[2:51:34] <%ShinobiPhoenix> two missile
[2:51:39] <+seemooone> you can jump and press zl for instant air ball
[2:51:49] <%ShinobiPhoenix> you can aim WHILE hanging
[2:52:01] <%ShinobiPhoenix> you literally did fighting the boos
[2:52:02] <majindusto> No Morph Bombs?
[2:52:04] <%ShinobiPhoenix> boss
[2:52:15] <%ShinobiPhoenix> no bombs yet
[2:52:20] <%ennui_on_me> @majindusto not yet
[2:52:22] <Dr00_PhD> not yet
[2:52:22] <%ShinobiPhoenix> some games they give you bombs
[2:52:22] <+TaurusOxford> @majindusto bombs come later
[2:52:26] <+seemooone> its really useful when you have bomb blocks on top of you
[2:52:35] <%ShinobiPhoenix> others you ahve to earn your EXPLODING BALLS

[2:56:52] <majindusto> Mushrooms  TOO STRONG
[2:57:04] <+gwanzan> impossible
[2:57:06] <majindusto> No?
[2:57:06] <brachydios777> hmmmmmmm
[2:57:09] <olaksi> metroids are extinct silly
[2:57:13] <+gustavozxd> it does not in fact mean that.... or does it...?
[2:57:15] <%InternetShis> :)
[2:57:18] <%nichos7> What? No, that's stupid
[2:57:22] <%polothegreatest> TITTLE LUL
[2:57:23] <+gustavozxd> who knows :)
[2:57:27] <GilliamYaeger> You ARE a Metroid
[2:57:29] <%Felhad> A metroid? In Metroid? unpossible
[2:57:36] <+seemooone> :)
[2:57:39] <%ShinobiPhoenix> I mean, my theory about where Metroid HAS to go has been in stone for literally 20 years
[2:57:42] <+democrazyyy> man i would really DREAD seeing another metroid here
[2:57:43] <%polothegreatest> ah yeah
[2:57:44] <lonosis47> zekeTHINK zekeTHINK zekeTHINK zekeTHINK zekeTHINK zekeTHINK zekeTHINK zekeTHINK zekeTHINK zekeTHINK zekeTHINK
[2:57:47] <majindusto> Samus  is Metroid  tho
[2:57:47] <RyuuAoi> @shinobiphoenix Buy ALL the old physical copies you can. They get expensive AF over time. One day Sneak King gonna be worth millions.
[2:57:47] <%captain_thickthighs> shussh
[2:57:47] <+superkeaton> Bottom left
[2:57:55] <+Jrockoni> does Samus eat food or does she just survive off parasites now.
[2:58:03] <+gustavozxd> Metroid went from being the name of the alien to the name of the protagonist, technically
[2:58:10] <%InternetShis> Samus eats metal
[2:58:11] <%extradopeness> yeah the real metroids were the friends we made along the way
[2:58:15] <@GeneralSCPatton> I just achieved 69 missiles
[2:58:18] <GhostKaiju> Parasites can be a food, technically
[2:58:24] <GhostKaiju> Nice
[2:58:30] <%Cozy90> @GeneralSCPatton thats hot
[2:58:30] <RyuuAoi> @extradopeness I like that.
[2:58:31] <+gustavozxd> @generalscpatton congrats atpCap
[2:58:32] <%Forbidden_Karp> I thought Metroid was the name of the princess
[2:58:32] <+superkeaton> @GeneralSCPatton Nice
[2:58:43] <fusioncell12> @gustavozxd and it was all thanks to "the baby"
[2:58:43] <%Felhad> why cant samus crawl
[2:58:46] <%ShinobiPhoenix> It must suck that Samus can't have Ice cream now
[2:59:04] <fusioncell12> @gustavozxd Samus said in a deadpan voice
[2:59:05] <%ShinobiPhoenix> now Samus is MORE angry at Ridley because she can't have ice cream
[2:59:08] <+seemooone> yess
[2:59:08] <%that__tj> Teleportaahs
[2:59:09] <lonosis47> @democrazyyy You're so funny man. Unfortunately I'm gonna have to block you or else I might die from the laughter. :) muted
[2:59:11] <+superkeaton> That is a substantial teleport
[2:59:11] <RyuuAoi> @felhad Because she's in her suit. Duh.
[2:59:20] <GhostKaiju> OH
[2:59:20] <+superkeaton> TELEPOR
[2:59:22] <Saltmeisterr> COOL
[2:59:23] <%KeiganOfAstora> This is some anime shit
[2:59:25] <%polothegreatest> psaWink psaWink
[2:59:29] <%FacetiousAF> ??
[2:59:30] <MisterAngryEyes112> waow that's a good loading screen
[2:59:32] <%FacetiousAF> loading screen?
[2:59:34] <knotsundownsyndrome> i have telepormed spangnob
[2:59:34] <GhostKaiju> Oh that's sick
[2:59:42] <%RealThiele> loading screen framrate :(
[2:59:44] <%KeiganOfAstora> Loading screen
[2:59:50] <%FacetiousAF> TEN
[2:59:50] <+gustavozxd> B I G
[2:59:53] <tanarath> @jrockoni her suit was magic from day 0 & she was genetically engineered to the nines from being like 6. She probably can, but doesn't need to in her suit.
[2:59:55] <MisterAngryEyes112> +10?!
[2:59:56] <%ShinobiPhoenix> so in Star Trek rules, does that mean original Samus is dead and this is a different Samus unless the teleporter messes up and there's two Samuses running around
[2:59:59] <%Forbidden_Karp> Be wary of teleporter psychosis
[2:59:59] <%polothegreatest> WAT?
[3:00:01] <%InternetShis> psaBig
[3:00:01] <MisterAngryEyes112> that's like ten ones
[3:00:08] <+seemooone> i really miss the item jingle man
[3:00:14] <%InternetShis> TEN
[3:00:19] <%Felhad> thats 5 whole 2s
[3:00:22] <akitanito> ten one's
[3:00:28] <tanarath> @shinobiphoenix Think about the morph ball
[3:00:37] <%ShinobiPhoenix> for those who REALLY know your Star Trek, for the rest, let's just say there are TWO COmmander Rikers
[3:00:38] <+cubbywolf> did Pat unlock the time stop yet?
[3:00:53] <%RealThiele> british time
[3:01:10] <peachy996> righty-o
[3:01:15] <%extradopeness> jolly good pip
[3:01:16] <+Flunkorg> more or less
[3:01:17] <%KeiganOfAstora> Isn't that what these games do?
[3:01:18] <$OfficerMods> it begins
[3:01:23] <%InternetShis> Yes
[3:01:23] <%ShinobiPhoenix> @PatStaresAt DO a sliding Parry, it's the flash kick
[3:01:26] <fusioncell12> @tanarath wrong metroid
[3:01:28] <Saltmeisterr> is there more in Ataria?
[3:01:29] <+seemooone> you did but now you can actually go there
[3:01:32] <+seemooone> without teleport
[3:01:34] <%InternetShis> That is the Metroidvania
[3:01:37] <peachy996> pip pip cheerio ya fookin bastahd
[3:01:39] <%KeiganOfAstora> It's like when Woolie found the first bonfire shortcut in Dark Souls 1
[3:01:41] <RyuuAoi> Pat will figure it out.
[3:01:45] <+tsmasher1000> Hey Pat enjoying the game thus far?
[3:01:56] <%SveriSageAdvice> @cubbywolf dude, you should know better not to ask "hey did person do ____ yet?"
[3:02:07] <%InternetShis> Oh this music
[3:02:26] <tealo972> no
[3:02:28] <+tsmasher1000> Pat's big brain will figure it out
[3:02:31] <+seemooone> no
[3:02:32] <%that__tj> nah
[3:02:33] <RyuuAoi> @internetshis STRONG
[3:02:36] <Saltmeisterr> NO
[3:02:36] <peachy996> I like how unsettling and science-y this soundtrack is
[3:02:37] <fusioncell12> @tanarath Wait wrong person
[3:02:39] <%that__tj> only once emmis dead
[3:02:40] <rat_boy1996> valve? gaben?
[3:02:40] <%RealThiele> the two-tone map discovery is not very good
[3:02:41] <+seemooone> if its a ??? it means you cant open
[3:02:53] <%ShinobiPhoenix> Pat is actually where I am, we're both just hunting around first
[3:02:59] <%ShinobiPhoenix> actually I am little ahead of pat
[3:03:09] <%ShinobiPhoenix> I have THE NEXT big item
[3:03:15] <%ShinobiPhoenix> and then Pat is up to where I am
[3:03:16] <Saltmeisterr> Pat that goes into HOT

[3:03:18] <rottingpastry> green/grey is emmi, blue is not emmi. it's fine
[3:03:46] <%ShinobiPhoenix> Grey is EMMI, Green is DEAD EMMI
[3:03:58] <+ReiDuran> shit pat just reminded me of where I should check next hahah
[3:04:02] <+cubbywolf> @SveriSageAdvice yeah, but it's a reference to SBFP
[3:04:11] <%ShinobiPhoenix> that was an item btw
[3:04:20] <tealo972> yes
[3:04:21] <%ShinobiPhoenix> but you don't ahve the item to get that item
[3:04:28] <+superkeaton> LUL
[3:04:28] <Darkrenai> LUL
[3:04:34] <%KeiganOfAstora> What? I looked away for a second
[3:04:34] <majindusto> enigmaKEK
[3:04:35] <%SveriSageAdvice> @cubbywolf so its not an actual thing in the game?
[3:04:38] <AngryAsian5> LUL
[3:04:38] <miucsa51> LUL LUL
[3:04:44] <MisterAngryEyes112> started at the spooky room now we here (again)
[3:04:50] <+cubbywolf> fuck if I know i dont own a switch
[3:04:53] <peachy996> Get Metroided bitch
[3:04:56] <%extradopeness> time stop? lol i dont think so
[3:04:58] <%that__tj> Pat bad at videogames for baby
[3:05:03] <%ShinobiPhoenix> I can tell you where I went next, but I don't think I should
[3:05:05] <%shiplord13> Does he not see the enterance to an area he hasn't explored at all?
[3:05:09] <+cubbywolf> LUL
[3:05:10] <Dr00_PhD> @AngryAsian5 Timestop is always a meme
[3:05:10] <redwidow1358> I don't know if you realized, but you don't have to unmorph all the time, press B to jump as the ball
[3:05:12] <%that__tj> thats mean and untrue, this game is hard as shit
[3:05:13] <%FacetiousAF> i know i am
[3:05:22] <miucsa51> Kappa
[3:05:23] <Coystick> Local bad video gamer in denial
[3:05:27] <Astrophizz> easy mode is now available
[3:05:31] <+cubbywolf> LUL baby wanna cwy?
[3:05:32] <tanarath> Pat is a baby
[3:05:37] <%ShinobiPhoenix> I hunted for Missiles and then I went to a certaian thing I was curious about
[3:05:44] <peachy996> You are adequate at games for baby
[3:05:49] <Coystick> Bad video game baby
[3:05:53] <%KeiganOfAstora> Pat, you're like 40% through the game already LUL
[3:06:04] <olaksi> might be worth it to pop in the lava rooms just to mark them on map
[3:06:05] <+cubbywolf> for a baby I'd say, "that baby is a good gaming baby"
[3:06:05] <peachy996> But INCREDIBLY Adequate!
[3:06:13] <tealo972> take teleporteur back
[3:06:26] <RyuuAoi> This game is NOT for babies! Pat, cut it off!
[3:06:29] <CaptainBright> One thing I have to say : SAMUS MOVES REAL FAST IN THIS GAM
[3:06:32] <kinkade_77> samus is so FAST
[3:06:39] <+cubbywolf> LUL
[3:06:52] <Darkrenai> Pat is at least 15% baby
[3:07:00] <yficaptions> they made her suit chonkier huh
[3:07:08] <%ShinobiPhoenix> @PatStaresAt just got Morph Ball, where was a bunch of places you want to use the Morph Ball crawl (think in Metroid Logic)?
[3:07:09] <knotsundownsyndrome> more than 15%
[3:07:12] <knotsundownsyndrome> a lot more than 15%
[3:07:14] <$OfficerMods> chonk is one way to put her armor
[3:07:17] <$OfficerMods> man
[3:07:20] <PlaidisTheNewPlaid> Is Pat always super quiet for anyone else, or is it just me?
[3:07:26] <$OfficerMods> i really can't wait for pat to see whats in this game
[3:07:27] <kinkade_77> best looking suit is this one imo
[3:07:28] <%Archphronimos> Archphronimos subscribed with Prime. They've subscribed for 32 months! 
[3:07:31] <$OfficerMods> its really cool
[3:07:44] <%RealThiele> light suit is best suit
[3:07:44] <+cubbywolf> morph out
[3:07:49] <+cubbywolf> LUL
[3:07:54] <%Felhad> hes about the same as game volume to me
[3:07:57] <%ShinobiPhoenix> Metroid really is the creator of the Dark Souls Shortcut
[3:08:10] <+cubbywolf> idk man the light suit is almost too shiny but maybe thats just twitch
[3:08:14] <RyuuAoi> Our ten year old minds would get stuck on first Emmi. Honestly
[3:08:14] <%Monkeyweed21> congrats you went in a circle
[3:08:15] <Shwepie> I can't wait until Pat realizes his mistake.
[3:08:17] <%extradopeness> poor giefy
[3:08:24] <%ShinobiPhoenix> THERE YOU GO
[3:08:25] <%that__tj> back to firelink shrine
[3:08:34] <$StrawberryPantsu> Why can't Metroid crawl?
[3:08:39] <+cubbywolf> time to cash in those souls
[3:08:40] <JoshGGtv> is this a new metroid
[3:08:42] <+chiazam> So is Pat enjoying his Corner Scratching?
[3:08:46] <+cubbywolf> because of the armour!
[3:08:49] <%ShinobiPhoenix> now you have a lot of Morph Ball crawl places to go through
[3:08:57] <%Monkeyweed21> Back to Doza
[3:08:58] <Darkrenai> Elevator loading screen üëç
[3:09:00] <%Felhad> why cant zelda morph ball
[3:09:02] <+chiazam> @joshggtv ye
[3:09:03] <%megadblitz> will this happen every time? the elevator?
[3:09:04] <%InternetShis> I like this color of blue with the white
[3:09:11] <kragor__> finall,y metroid can,, craw l
[3:09:12] <reonome> i love that screen
[3:09:15] <%extradopeness> what if metroid was a girl
[3:09:21] <%ShinobiPhoenix> look for THIN tunnels
[3:09:24] <%megadblitz> if so i hope samus has little waiting idles later on
[3:09:31] <%ShinobiPhoenix> and MISSILES already marked
[3:09:38] <+chiazam> that loading screen has to be sick since it goes so long
[3:09:39] <GhostKaiju> @extradopeness BAH, could never happen
[3:09:44] <RyuuAoi> Pat, are you gonna upgrade to Switch OLED?
[3:09:50] <Saltmeisterr> hmmmm
[3:10:03] <%RealThiele> "upgrade"
[3:10:04] <%Cozy90> i like this music
[3:10:11] <$OfficerMods> welcome to the TRUE gameplay
[3:10:13] <+Flunkorg> Why not get that energy tank?
[3:10:16] <brachydios777> 'upgrade'
[3:10:20] <%ShogunNoonto> I know Ether M  kind of poisoned the water  But do you think they should have took another crack at giving her a voice A chance to flush out the character
[3:10:20] <RyuuAoi> @realthiele Right ha
[3:10:22] <%ShinobiPhoenix> I didn't want the OLED< but then I saw the BLACKNESS on the screen and saw the lightness on mine and I wanted the BLACKNESS
[3:10:27] <%Felhad> Doesnt seem like Pat does much handheld mode if any, so the upgrade would be meaningless
[3:10:31] <tealo972> energie tank part
[3:10:42] <%polothegreatest> oled is only for new customers
[3:10:43] <%walternatorz> words.
[3:10:49] <Darkrenai> O L E - NO
[3:10:51] <+TheMeromex> say that again
[3:10:52] <%that__tj> @ShogunNoonto whos to say she doesnt talk anymore
[3:10:52] <%extradopeness> absolutely need that OLED in my life
[3:10:52] <%RealThiele> LAPD version
[3:10:52] <lonosis47> What pat
[3:10:52] <%crimsonharvest> No, voices almost always make a  character worse especially one that's been silent for the vast majority of the series
[3:10:53] <+chiazam> he self-reportedly never undocks his Switch, so I think that‚Äôs a no
[3:10:54] <%ShinobiPhoenix> if you don't use handheld, don't bother
[3:10:55] <akitanito> ???
[3:10:58] <%FacetiousAF> switch oled is just a nicer portable screen. that's it.
[3:10:59] <AngryAsian5> Interesting sentence
[3:11:02] <peachy996> That's right Pat!
[3:11:04] <RyuuAoi> @polothegreatest Fucking joy con drift
[3:11:08] <%KeiganOfAstora> Not a one?
[3:11:13] <%ShinobiPhoenix> if you use handheld and the BLACKS are too white, get it
[3:11:15] <%KeiganOfAstora> What about the toilet?
[3:11:22] <%walternatorz> not even for the bathroom?
[3:11:23] <%ShinobiPhoenix> that was for Woolie
[3:11:24] <%InternetShis> I want an ODST Samus voiced only by efforts, but make it a really gruff lady
[3:11:27] <%RealThiele> pat cannot game while shitting he focuses too hard
[3:11:30] <%abelincoln_catpuncher> @ryuuaoi I've lost so many joycons to it :(
[3:11:30] <tangowulf> Super Metroid had the best environmental design, Zero mission had the best level design, Fusion had the best narrative and bosses, and Dread has the best controls. If Mercury Team ever remake Super Metroid, it'd probably be the perfect game
[3:11:30] <%crimsonharvest> i got the pro switch grips pretty good, my TV is too laggy for games to be fun
[3:11:32] <akitanito> the long dump I guess
[3:11:32] <%KeiganOfAstora> 10-15 minutes in the morning
[3:11:35] <+chiazam> Samus only needs to talk like three times a game for badass one liners and THATS IT
[3:11:36] <BinaryShuffle> Eat more fiber
[3:11:37] <Darkrenai> Hey sometimes you just gotta wait it out on the toilet
[3:11:39] <Cobaltor_252> long enough for my legs to fall asleep
[3:11:43] <%KeiganOfAstora> I take my time
[3:11:44] <+Sendrak70> Dont forget, Pat only shits when its an emergency.
[3:11:44] <%InternetShis> Big shits
[3:11:44] <%walternatorz> you've talked in chat on the toilet
[3:11:44] <%GarbageNirvana> @ShinobiPhoenix Woolie's not here m8
[3:11:45] <%Nobody404> but what if you want to stream on the toilet
[3:11:45] <@Ranryu692> yeah, on the toilet
[3:11:46] <tanarath> @shogunnoonto it's like giving doomguy a voice
[3:11:47] <+MajorCrasher> 20 minutes
[3:11:58] <%ShinobiPhoenix> Woolie is ALWAYS here!
[3:11:58] <+healnavi> an hour
[3:12:00] <peachy996> You don't take 8 hour dumps? pff loser
[3:12:01] <majindusto> I'm gonna eventually  get an OLED to replace  my cracking launch Switch
[3:12:02] <%JoshManVGH> Until it is done
[3:12:04] <AngryAsian5> Never skip out on fibre
[3:12:08] <%Cozy90> i play my switch alot less than i thought i would
[3:12:10] <+Evendrag> @PatStaresAt i know you havent been into metroid all that much, how you feeling so far?
[3:12:10] <lonosis47> Pat never been a nintendo guy
[3:12:11] <%crimsonharvest> Pat why dont you shit while you stream? it's foolish to not get paid for it.
[3:12:11] <%KeiganOfAstora> @Cozy90 Don't you dare lol
[3:12:12] <RyuuAoi> Switch and shit, Pat!
[3:12:25] <%Cozy90> @KeiganOfAstora hahahaha
[3:12:26] <%ShinobiPhoenix> I still want to hold out for that Switch Pro
[3:12:27] <%lehvak182> @patstaresat what about SMT V?
[3:12:32] <%MugenSandan> But doomguy does have a voice!  He speaks the language of violence
[3:12:38] <brachydios777> Doom Guy had one line and it was cool
[3:12:47] <+chiazam> Can you mark things on the map?
[3:12:48] <%crimsonharvest> always try to poop on the clock
[3:12:55] <%ShinobiPhoenix> I can't believe Samus and DOomguy can kiss now
[3:12:57] <%Monkeyweed21> why is Pat running away from progress?
[3:12:57] <Darkrenai> rip and T E A R
[3:13:01] <GhostKaiju> Map marking is a thing, yeah
[3:13:03] <%Fooguwu> dig up stupid
[3:13:07] <RyuuAoi> @lehvak182 Right! Play that shit in bed and on the toilet. Gonna be a long one!
[3:13:09] <%KeiganOfAstora> @crimsonharvest Get an extra 10 minute break that way
[3:13:14] <%that__tj> dig up
[3:13:15] <%ShinobiPhoenix> I assume the item is behind the area you can't go yet
[3:13:30] <%InternetShis> Mega Tall Samus and smol doom boi can bump helmets
[3:13:32] <Vertigheist> Samus without a voice is kinda cooler
[3:13:32] <%lehvak182> @ryuuaoi this man gets it!
[3:13:59] <%Felhad> why cant metroid swim
[3:14:04] <%notsoy> save samus voice for smash
[3:14:05] <%ShinobiPhoenix> I was looking for it too, and my logic says it's behind the area I can't go since it's not logically with the other blocks

[3:24:03] <MisterAngryEyes112> well travel speed is not equivalent to combat speed on some forums
[3:24:05] <Banish55> She looks like she moves a lot faster in this game
[3:24:06] <RyuuAoi> She's lighter?
[3:24:07] <Shwepie> I can't wait until Pat realizes his mistake.
[3:24:12] <peachy996> She's built up a lot of energy from not having to do for 17 years
[3:24:16] <tanarath> @patstaresat You got the Varia suit, so you can go into fire rooms

[3:33:16] <rottingpastry> it's almost like you turned the room above it into a hellscape
[3:33:20] <%TheLemuroid> Teleport being blocked means they wanted you to use it
[3:33:25] <Vivirmos> button up top

[3:39:45] <RyuuAoi> Ridley won't show Keepo
[3:39:45] <Parapattern> He gets around
[3:39:45] <+JonathLP> A kraid, not the kraid
[3:39:46] <%Deft_Thought> How is this asshole still alive?
[3:39:48] <reonome> he was in the trailer
[3:39:48] <SaltyAzteca> LOL SAMUS IS SICK OF KRAID'S SHIT
[3:39:49] <+Sendrak70> What if its not him, just a member of his species.

[3:39:51] <haisho> I don't know either but he's in jail and really pissed
[3:39:53] <+LastHazzerd> Samus is not afraid at all
[3:39:53] <%JoshManVGH> I'M THE BIGGEST DRAGON THAT YOU'VE EVER SEEN YOUR GONNA DIE MOTHERFUCKER I TAKE UP 5 SCREENS
[3:39:53] <+emVulpine> I don't think Metroid Prime is canon to the 2D games.
[3:39:55] <Explodincatz> because Nintendo lacks creativity
[3:39:56] <%KeiganOfAstora> How is this a fight? He's chained up. Just leave him there
[3:39:57] <%TheLemuroid> Clearly imprisoned too
[3:39:59] <%GarbageNirvana> @KeiganOfAstora This is as far forward in the timeline as the series has been, post-Fusion
[3:39:59] <%Tearonex> Kraid is fucking alive just to die agai
[3:40:00] <%extradopeness> KRAID is FINALLY HERE!
[3:40:02] <+gustavozxd> @emvulpine no problem, it's weird that pat isn't using it LUL
[3:40:03] <+Sendrak70> Look at that gross belly hole.
[3:40:03] <%MisterRockett> I like how they chained him up to justify the boss working the same was as it did in the old games.
[3:40:03] <%RealThiele> cause Zebes was a chozo homeworld so they had a backup of him? iunno
[3:40:06] <%Bluwizard21> @PatStaresAt It is not really explained other than maybe some allusions to it
[3:40:07] <%that__tj> Samus gave 0 SHITS
[3:40:07] <+pectusumbra> Federation needs to get blown out
[3:40:10] <mike2hands> YEYEYEYE THE NAILS
[3:40:17] <%KeiganOfAstora> Prime is between 1 and 2 or 2 and Super?
[3:40:18] <%Bluwizard21> also kraid is pretty nasty in this
[3:40:19] <Shwepie> @KeiganOfAstora Takes place after Fusion. M1/Zero Mission, Prime Games, M2, Super, Other M, Fusion, This.
[3:40:20] <%KeiganOfAstora> I forget

[3:54:22] <+chiazam> it‚Äôs all your fault
[3:54:22] <+LastHazzerd> unsure which is worse, people telling pat where to go, or people shouting blind causing pat to die
[3:54:28] <+ReallyBigRocks> there's too many different bits going on in chat I cant keep up
[3:54:30] <+seemooone> theres another one by the lava up top
[3:54:32] <+pectusumbra> maybe from the other side on that one?
[3:54:42] <jmuster> chat is very not easy to read with people sayin different shit constantly lol
[3:54:46] <rat_boy1996> no the other one
[3:54:56] <@GeneralSCPatton> You can jump off those ledges without curling into them

[3:55:37] <@GeneralSCPatton> Just do clean jumps from the ledges without rolling inside
[3:55:37] <+LastHazzerd> if you don't wanna ball into the ledge, don't hold up.
[3:55:40] <+CherteuseKapibara> are the controls painful for this game?

[4:03:34] <OldManRamos> That parry window is laughably tiny
[4:03:35] <%yoshkosh20> I can't get over how insanely smooth this game runs
[4:03:36] <%JoshManVGH> Stop being good at games, Pat, you're making the rest of the internet look bad.
