[0:27:14] <disflipmat> I love that they're porting Crash to a system that no one can buy
[0:27:18] <+NaLLex9> Actually though
[0:27:19] <+Kduff89> 60fps for platformers feels so fucking good
[0:27:22] <+abrupt_abe> Isn't that already happening?
[0:27:24] <PhantomMaskJr> This game sucked balls sstWTF
[0:27:25] <mrjplays2k9> who is that twink ass bandicoot
[0:27:25] <dinnydanny777> I've never really cared about playing Crash in 4K ngl

[0:27:48] <%rytisone> damn

[0:28:00] <Cosairen> i dont really care about 4k but if we drop to 30fps again im gonna commit a crime of passion
[0:28:03] <+TheEvilOmega> After that, I'll be putting on Miles Morales and Demon Souls.
[0:28:03] <cherrycottontail> "Never" says 500GB call of duty game
[0:28:03] <%brickwall35> anyone who chooses anything but performance mode should be launched into the sun

[0:28:11] <%ospreyworks> Woof
[0:28:16] <Cymen90> @patstaresat but the problem is, most people chose fidelity over frame rate

[0:28:22] <+Shishi1205> Thats rachet and clank

[0:28:24] <%hewlettfan96> Yessshh
[0:28:24] <MeMillionthDollar> 100?!
[0:28:25] <+OverzealousEuthanasiast> 4k is only worth it once 60fps is maintained
[0:28:25] <penitentpendant> Random Pinecone poppin' out
[0:28:25] <exploitativity2> why does bitrate have such a problem with the color green?
[0:28:26] <nomolomo> i mean it looks wonderful, just boring game

[0:32:44] <Animeshowfan> i mean to be fair the game its self looks like it could be fun. its just the trailers set up was so much  better

[0:33:46] <%Movemeister> Skip the middle man and marry the poo
[0:33:47] <+SadSadSenpai> for those that just got here missed crash and returnal
[0:33:48] <%Broken_Sonex> You're realising this now? @PatStaresAt
[0:33:48] <%mostbrokenrobo> too bad the games sucked
[0:33:49] <benjiFG> hey look you can be pat
[0:33:49] <T_Sasquatch> those wings looked nice tho
[0:33:49] <+possumwalsh1221> WAAAY WORSE
[0:33:49] <sydowoodo> wasn't that 2016
[0:33:50] <penitentpendant> Most of the time there's only one or two things worth mentioning on 'decent' ones
[0:33:50] <LORDSPOOKLEKINS> It's just that they have a bunch more shit so it feels WAY worse
[0:33:51] <%Ipsenscastle> same
[0:33:52] <%Monkeyweed21> that one sucked
[0:33:52] <mrjplays2k9> the ps5 reveal thing
[0:33:52] <+Gallhint> Well Covid....
[0:33:53] <pixel_andarilho> this is some chetaman ass soundtrack
[0:33:53] <%saiko2208> This game looks so meh
[0:33:54] <%monsieurfantastic> the last good one was monster hunter and re2
[0:33:54] <%crimsonharvest> Ever since they tried to pretend that shit PS4 launched with it's been so ... stale
[0:33:54] <%sporeian94> This just feels like a nintendo direct ripoff
[0:33:54] <xXjuffelXx> They are going for the cheapest way to show them
[0:33:55] <exploitativity2> been a hot minute since DMC5
[0:33:55] <%AnthroMetal> E3 2018 was the last good one
[0:33:55] <%watts121> I got super hype for FF16
[0:33:55] <mesamus> and that was xbox pat
[0:33:55] <Zebroneath> This looks like a bad version of Lethal League
[0:33:56] <Solidnick18> most this shit is ads or trash
[0:33:57] <Felto3> at least they have gameplay now
[0:33:57] <+lucidrush> and everyone shit on that one lol
[0:33:57] <pennykettle_> I'd rather have more brown green 2008 military shooters than more of these cartoon shits
[0:33:57] <+Walopoh> Because every shitty game thinks they're the next hype thing
[0:33:57] <dukenux> The flute man one?
[0:33:58] <Sotetsu> This needs more Metallica
[0:33:59] <+OmegaWeltall> naw dood, we've been watching these for 20 years and for that long its all been shit
[0:33:59] <tranquilturnip> There's more of them, and they're less impressive
[0:34:00] <SovPho> Wait why the fuck not?
[0:34:01] <NitronStreams> Remember when they just went from trailer to trailer with no breaks one year
[0:34:02] <Cosairen> god this game is ugly
[0:34:02] <%bigboyeggo> a LUL
[0:34:03] <+lethallylactic> LUL
[0:34:03] <%dekkitout> DMC V was an xbox too
[0:34:03] <%Standard_Enemy> Astral chain was hype too
[0:34:04] <+AbnormalVoid> LUL
[0:34:04] <+xtkxyz> most games are bad LUL
[0:34:06] <+MajorCrasher> LUL
[0:34:06] <+brokeglobe1022> Sony ruined it in 2017 by announcing 5 great new things
[0:34:06] <Lutre> Nintendo Direct ruined an entire generation of announcements
[0:34:08] <+Gallhint> Pandemics do that LUL
[0:34:08] <%ItsYaGirlMaria> well I mean, you can also blame the pandemic
[0:34:09] <%BallerSwagBro9k> I super agree. Since DMC 5 every show has been garbage
[0:34:09] <%BoxNavy> :(
[0:34:09] <auraofdawn> they just pad them with shovel ware now
[0:34:09] <ape_hawk> is the stream cutting out for anyone else?
[0:34:10] <%hewlettfan96> There’s no real sense of thrill really
[0:34:10] <%MrMegaJackpots> covid don't help
[0:34:10] <Spirit_hz> totally true they're shit now
[0:34:11] <thelonechris> The last time I got super hyped was when Doom Eternal was announced
[0:34:11] <reonome> this is already taking up too much time ResidentSleeper
[0:34:11] <winner_92> this looks like nothing i feel nothing looking at this
[0:34:11] <dinnydanny777> Oh FF16 was hype
[0:34:13] <Solidnick18> yeah cause that will take awhile
[0:34:14] <+Shishi1205> LUL
[0:34:14] <%Pappajimbo> classy with a big Y
[0:34:14] <Darren716> Yes there can
[0:34:15] <Taclism> Who is this made for ...
[0:34:15] <BlueBiscuitGT> I have never even attended one, and even I can tell that the got worse every year since 2016
[0:34:15] <%Ipsenscastle> big lull, for sure
[0:34:16] <+Taberner1604> did Mario Golf not do it for you? LUL
[0:34:16] <PinoProxie> LUL
[0:34:16] <+VantaLow> bomb rush cyberfunk got a pop off from me
[0:34:17] <chaosjoey> it looks fine
[0:34:17] <F_manS> Seems 2022 is gonna pick up.
[0:34:18] <+michingmallecho> There is a pandemic you know LUL
[0:34:20] <NDenizen> >EA
[0:34:20] <+SadSadSenpai> so mean
[0:34:20] <+Plaguemelon> EA LUL
[0:34:21] <ShiningAxis> throwing the ball looks so unsatisfying
[0:34:22] <+AbnormalVoid> not really
[0:34:22] <%Niney_Who> Game's fine
[0:34:23] <%BoxNavy> we wont be seeing ff15 here
[0:34:23] <CassyASG> it feels like pp in general put low effort into things now
[0:34:24] <NanoHologuise> JSR lookin logo
[0:34:24] <+evbites> Stop doing fortnite
[0:34:24] <Radioactivetaco9> Everything is annouced as a teaser trail;er 3 years before they come out
[0:34:25] <%troubled_ginger> EW EA
[0:34:25] <+OmegaWeltall> EA...gross
[0:34:26] <trfurkanrey18> doom eternal for me
[0:34:26] <Sotetsu> New Subnautica comes out in May, that's good.
[0:34:26] <%BoxNavy> 16*
[0:34:26] <%rytisone> for a 2030 game
[0:34:27] <+jau_twitch> knockout city looks... resoundingly meh
[0:34:27] <+ennui_on_me> Were you not excited when Deadly Premonition 2 was shown
[0:34:27] <+Catpurnicus> feels like 2014 again when nothing was out for Switch
[0:34:27] <PhantomMaskJr> Nintendo Direct > State of Play sstGrump
[0:34:28] <%abusywizard> i feel like companies sholdn't be allowed to announce games unless people would give a shit
[0:34:28] <OneThousandTomatoes> im here for ff16
[0:34:29] <%QueequegTheater> It's for Woolie
[0:34:29] <%DianaTheAscian> @PatStaresAt mhw announcement was cool
[0:34:29] <%Ipsenscastle> we've been in a lull overall since 2016 honestly
[0:34:29] <penitentpendant> RE8 has some hype, at least
[0:34:29] <%hewlettfan96> I remember the last truly great one being 2015-2017
[0:34:29] <+DoktorZee> for children not watching these shows!
[0:34:29] <%orcstr16> Nothings coming out this year aside from GOWR.
[0:34:30] <Darmarock> I really liked that E3 when three Fromsoftware games were announced
[0:34:30] <%Masked_Hero_Lucky> It's for the Fortnite kids
[0:34:30] <%PanicSwytch> So this is dodge ball
[0:34:31] <%Niney_Who> Pat it was an INDIE GAME about Dodgeball it's harmless
[0:34:31] <+NaLLex9> True
[0:34:31] <+lucidrush> wheres monday night combat
[0:34:32] <+FoolsArcade> If the dodgeball game is on PC i'll try it
[0:34:32] <xeros720> that someone is already playing ninjala
[0:34:32] <tolloponik> but nothing happened in that show
[0:34:33] <dukenux> YEAH THIS JUST RIPS OFF JSR LOGO
[0:34:33] <auraofdawn> Bc they released the new consoles too early with too little
[0:34:34] <@SoFarFetched> Pat doesn't wanna play with THOSE balls,he wants to play with HIS balls.

[0:46:09] <%GarbageQueenEllie> I've always liked this aesthetic, esp the music
[0:46:10] <%Masked_Hero_Lucky> No, Pat, you said that saving the gluckens was hard, you mixed up the good and bad guys.
[0:46:12] <%Cozy90> ANCIENT ASIAN MUSIC
[0:46:13] <+Walopoh> You said SAVING all the Glukkans, it's the opposite @PatStaresAt
[0:46:13] <%GarbageNirvana> oh no it's the virgil

[0:46:35] <teflonbilly777> This really looks like a movie
[0:46:36] <+CelioHogane> @peachy996 I dunno the Mudokons don't look very fuckeable.

[0:46:41] <T_Sasquatch> oh shit actual gameplay
[0:46:42] <Animeshowfan> its looks incredble
[0:46:42] <hat_under_bread> The environments look great, but the gameplay doesn't impress me.

[0:46:54] <nomolomo> this would have been great 10 years ago but now it feels kinda generic
[0:46:55] <%strakillias> this looks like a ps move or kinect game that was supposed to be the next big thing.
[0:46:55] <Binary7> The music gives me Ori vibes
[0:46:55] <+Shady_Zaku> Stairfax Temperatures?
[0:46:56] <deviljhojho_> yeah its jank as fuck

[0:50:48] <+MajorCrasher> Paige is right
[0:50:48] <phatmac16> thanks Paige
[0:50:48] <%KineticZen> Dishonored is very self-impressed

[0:51:03] <+possumwalsh1221> PREY UNDERRATED

[1:14:29] <T_Sasquatch> SO ITS STILL SUNSET ???
[1:14:32] <disflipmat> Back in the vault, bitches
[1:14:36] <biggdaddymike> I'm pretty sure anything from Season 12 onwards is still viable
[1:14:37] <%VintageSpiffy> That's not accurate at all.
[1:14:41] <%mield916> 2nd mobile game is just a remake again
[1:14:41] <%thegalvanicpanic> so I should just wait until the next season to get back in or is this season kosher?

[1:15:23] <KitsuneManami> @PatStaresAt IF Weiss is here, is Genesis Coming for Sure?
[1:15:26] <%MugenSandan> Wait I thought anything that WASNT sunset YET wasn't going to be Sunset
[1:15:28] <%TheWinged7> "its a feature"
[1:15:29] <Captain_Joe1911> tansy5Tuntun
[1:15:30] <+abrupt_abe> People told them sunsetting was a terrible idea as soon as it was announced and it took nearly a year for them to drop it
[1:15:31] <FortuneEX> I get to keep my curated Nation of Beast
[1:15:32] <@SoFarFetched> @ExpressNode It wouldn't make sense for a "Sony" direct to make a PC announcement. Also the 1 year exclusive isn't over yet.
[1:15:36] <%TheFramedWarlock> That's SO stupid
[1:15:37] <%dekkitout> In YOUR vault- my vault is fine 🙃
[1:15:38] <FennecZephyr> They DID say that any gear currently able to hit the max power cap will still be able to do so
[1:15:38] <+The_Butterfly_Man> I have already deleted my vault
[1:15:40] <+MephioTV> Literally I was like "I WANNA RAID" and didn't have the cool sunsetted machine gun so everyone said "No."
[1:15:41] <%Aeoneth> Nah it's basically the stuff they sunset up until the Saint 14 stuff.  But yeah Pat got screwed hard on that one
[1:15:45] <+TheMorilo> You can play the FF7 battle royale on an emulator
[1:15:47] <Zebroneath> all that work and effort, GONE
[1:15:48] <alegut88> since when did bungie become blizzard? recycling/forcing old content like that is fucking brutal
[1:15:52] <%Ziegsy> EVERCRISIS ANNOUNCED. ITS A COMPILATION
[1:15:54] <Cosairen> yeah someone just said "just play the game more i dont get it"
[1:15:55] <%JoshManVGH> That thing you like? Sunset! That girl you like? Sunset! That game you like? Never was!
[1:15:56] <%KishinGrek> check FF Twitter
[1:15:57] <%bhp_99> wow, its like they dont want ppl coming back to the game
[1:15:59] <%lassieme> I solved this by NOT PLAYING MORE DENSITY 2
[1:16:00] <%Anime_Flux> Gief's snores sound like a Silent Hill monster...
[1:16:00] <tanarath> Yeah, there needs to be the possibility of conversion.
[1:16:00] <theanora1> they shoul just adopt Warframe's gun system
[1:16:01] <teflonbilly777> Ever Crisis looks cute
[1:16:01] <%cephalon_nyt> that actually makes the sunsetting worse
[1:16:02] <Cosairen> that was so maddening
[1:16:02] <+michingmallecho> Crisis core is Back
[1:16:03] <+talkingrain3139> EVER CRISIS IS A FUCKING PHONE GAME

[1:38:51] <spreenkle> Food Vendor or Food Server...
[1:38:54] <+Alopekis> @LBC921 Yep. For android and iOS, which sucks because it looks cool. I'll probably still get it but I'd prefer it on something like the playstation or Switch.

[1:52:15] <+Alopekis> Apparently some people are getting that Twitch ad-block crap on browsers that don't even have an adblocker installed. You'd think they'd test this shit before putting it out, but I guess that would require them to be remotely competent.
[1:52:26] <I_OneGuy_Over_Heaven_I> it should be noted, npcs dont care if you run
[1:52:35] <Felto3> @PatStaresAt make sure you grab the key in the parking garage and the codes in the tunnel
[1:52:36] <darklurker_dumahiem> LET THEM CLAP ME...THE DOUBLE STANDS FOREVER
[1:52:39] <+CryptusMaximus> I prefer to "slowrun" hitman. Running is a big no no, because I have to look super cool
[1:52:41] <+solidmclovin> @I_OneGuy_Over_Heaven_I yeah but it looks cooler if u dont run
[1:52:51] <yourliteraldog> It's cool to stroll
[1:52:54] <+king_of_beggars> Walking is this game's mood.
[1:52:59] <+thecosmicfly> There's also levels to the walk, theres  NPC walking speed and slightly faster walking speed
[1:53:04] <+Alopekis> Do they not? I feel like they get suspicious of you quicker if you run if they're an enforcer.
[1:53:07] <%Ipsenscastle> tape's upstairs i think
[1:53:14] <yourliteraldog> 47 has what can only be called a Pimp Strut
[1:53:18] <+thesweatiest> Looks like the same beret you'd wear as a fashion designer

[1:53:27] <omenesia> Like the Sting song goes, Assassin's walk but never run
[1:53:34] <+king_of_beggars> Hitman is down to pound - the pavement - with his slow and deliberate gait.
