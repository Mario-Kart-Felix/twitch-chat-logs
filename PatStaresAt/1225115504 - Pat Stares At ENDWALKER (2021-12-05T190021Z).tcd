[0:08:28] <%PayCreeps_> im at 90 and im still not prepared
[0:08:44] <%VictorVonLouche> Funny how fitting this stupid intro is with endwalker lol
[0:08:44] <+fetrigon> @queequegtheater Did they reveal that zangief is the endwalker? Cause, if so, I totally called that.
[0:08:45] <@goose_attack_almanac> OH NO. STEVE BUSCEMI WAS IN THE MOON
[0:08:46] <%X2Eliah> This intro predicted Endwalker

[0:09:56] <%cooldude69xx> The Orb of the Earth
[0:09:57] <+FiggityFiggityFox> Ha he is already in lol, he was prepared for the que!
[0:09:58] <@goose_attack_almanac> Can't believe Steve Buscemi was haunting the moon. What a cool first trial
[0:10:00] <%StephanieSadGirl> Hes Patrick on the moon, with an orb like a balloon
[0:10:02] <marvel877> BROTHER! WE ARE ON THE MOON NOW!
[0:10:04] <RushUnplugged> moon's VERY haunted
[0:10:08] <%InternetShis> Literal moon ghosts
[0:10:16] <+fetrigon> queequeg hasn't answered my question. So that means my guess was right. KomodoHype
[0:10:19] <marvel877> We're whalers on the moon
[0:10:23] <%Monkeyweed21> @D00msDayDan literal ghosts on the moon, whaling with harpoons
[0:10:24] <%Screwdatguy> Overall how is the expansion comparing to others? Just looking to know if I SHOULD be excited!
[0:10:29] <%aishman> I SEE EARS
[0:10:29] <%SinnerEbru> damn, cool moon music
[0:10:34] <tanithmagnus> well, its a lot less haunted now
[0:10:37] <+victhebeard> when they said to the moon. I didn't think it would be to fight ghosts.
[0:10:39] <goroke> EXCITE, PAT'S GOING TO SEE THE BEST PART OF THE MOON
[0:10:40] <%aishman> Is that some BUN BOY PAT?
[0:10:49] <@QueequegTheater> @victhebeard Why else would we go to the moon

[0:11:52] <%furiousfurioso> are there any tricks to get around the 2002 error or is it just RNG
[0:11:54] <%RealThiele> paige attention span vs ARR is rough
[0:11:56] <%Screwdatguy> My friend was saying raids just turn into 1 room battles after Heavensward is that true?
[0:12:01] <+fetrigon> you guys don't use Amazon LUL
[0:12:03] <yaboi_raidshadowlegends> we on the moon? FeelsGoodMan

[0:12:29] <%Monkeyweed21> fair
[0:12:29] <%InternetShis> Based
[0:12:29] <+fetrigon> that's accurate tho.
[0:12:32] <+JustToWatch> Have you considered not being garbage then?
[0:12:33] <%VictorVonLouche> Well dont blame them, moon should be CLEAN AND PURE
[0:12:33] <@QueequegTheater> I'M TRYING TO LOG IN
[0:12:35] <%shurtal> Ultros
[0:12:36] <SeaReally> hot chips are just spicy chips

[0:13:02] <+FiggityFiggityFox> Waiting to log in lol but that's why I get to enjoy your stream! I'm number 2,347 now!
[0:13:06] <%valriot> its big fun
[0:13:07] <xxshadowxx416> what a queue i cant find it
[0:13:10] <+Akizea> thats ninja now too
[0:13:11] <+JustToWatch> @PatStaresAt you hear about the halo subreddit getting locked down?
[0:13:12] <+MosesUnspoken> I was logged in but had to step out for bit and got logged out and now I'm stuck at 2k queue.
[0:13:13] <+Akizea> new ninja is super fun
[0:13:14] <%Monkeyweed21> SMN AND MNK KEEP WINNING
[0:13:15] <%zyberion626> Reaper scratches a dps itch I never knew I had
[0:13:16] <+cellest_t> Hell yea it is!
[0:13:18] <SeaReally> i want to try monk
[0:13:26] <%zyberion626> whu happun
[0:13:29] <goroke> Oh for real? MNK change was good?
[0:13:30] <%Monkeyweed21> the favor moves are also really good
[0:13:34] <%InternetShis> All women born after 1993 know is eat WcDonald's, charge they phone, be bisexual, eat hot chip, and lie
[0:13:35] <%Tyrimat> BLM is fantastic from what I heard.
[0:13:36] <2Sam4Hall> Can confirm RDM also feels great
[0:13:42] <%InternetShis> Wow
[0:13:48] <Ids560> are you supposed to just hit the bahamut/phoenix button whenever it's up?
[0:13:53] <%valriot> just ban people
[0:13:59] <%AHomeschoolDropout> reddit is a blight
[0:13:59] <+natjen8> @PatStaresAt tbf thats how the FFXIV subreddit is right now with lots of the complaints about the queues. At least they didnt lock up the subreddit
[0:14:02] <Forulkan> i really dont like the MNK changes
[0:14:02] <%InternetShis> It will be worse
[0:14:06] <+JustToWatch> the doxxing and death threats got a bit out of hand
[0:14:10] <+Dwarven_Gaming> just saving LB @PatStaresAt
[0:14:15] <%RealThiele> just summon all the things
[0:14:19] <+fetrigon> sick KomodoHype
[0:14:20] <%Monkeyweed21> @goroke You get the chakra system at lvl 15 and the Blitz system at lvl 60 its great
[0:14:25] <%InternetShis> Yeah I'm not spending a penny on Halo besides campaign
[0:14:27] <%zyberion626> @patstaresat you had my curiosity. Now you have my attention
[0:14:30] <Blank9> rdm acceleration gives instant cast on verthunder/veraero/impact now
[0:14:30] <RushUnplugged> BLM can actually move during mechanics now, 2 charges or Triplecast means you're basically never out
[0:14:42] <Blank9> and manafication just gives enough gauge for full melee combo
[0:14:49] <%Screwdatguy> you can never take something back, else the person at the register MIGHT remember you
[0:14:57] <Blank9> and verholy/verflare/scorch are aoe for free
[0:15:03] <%zyberion626> ffxiv devs gave everyone a free week, that shut most people up
[0:15:22] <%valriot> the FF14 problems should be better, but its whatever
[0:15:26] <%InternetShis> Materials for servers are the only issue with 14
[0:15:30] <+ThetaFive> RDM just got all these nice little tweaks, its very smooth
[0:15:33] <%Monkeyweed21> MNK is also 50% new class
[0:15:33] <Sol_Install> oh moon
[0:15:38] <%zyberion626> @patstaresat MCH just got a shotgun. And that's all we ever needed
[0:15:38] <%InternetShis> Also the weirdness of early stat squish
[0:15:38] <goroke> WAR AoE giving 10% up is so nice
[0:15:39] <+Drspiderskull92> Monk is Fantastic now
[0:15:41] <Blank9> reaper is really 1 to 1 for aoe/single target
[0:15:43] <%Tyrimat> The enochian change is super nice.
[0:15:49] <goroke> No need to lose DPS to get the 3 single target in
[0:15:53] <%Screwdatguy> Is the moon pretty btw? I was most excited for it
[0:16:04] <@QueequegTheater> @PatStaresAt Dragoon AoE now keeps its combo going just like the single target
[0:16:08] <%barrakuta371> so if the moon is smaller than the planet why is the gravitational acceleration the same?
[0:16:14] <Sol_Install> !uptime
[0:16:15] <@Moobot> @Sol_Install I've been playing this game for how long? Oh only 16m 25s.
[0:16:18] <%zyberion626> Stormblood alliance raids are a bit tougher imo due to the squish
[0:16:19] <Blank9> I've heard rabanastre is rough times from friends
[0:16:30] <%Buttlo> Lalafell staring up at the shades must look hilarious.
[0:16:33] <Blank9> but that might just be from having 6 sages 10 reapers
[0:16:35] <+ThetaFive> if you have questions about the moon, the answer is "magic"
[0:16:40] <%Monkeyweed21> @barrakuta371 Zodiark is so dummy thicc it ups the gravity to normal
[0:16:44] <%kid_flashionable> @blank9 just curious, how would it be getting rough?
[0:16:47] <JustAnotherMuffin> Has pat Started the MSQ yet?
[0:16:51] <%Screwdatguy> 2002ed once again but I snagged my spot. Stay strong crew
[0:16:54] <%legendfather_of_giants> yeah undersized gives the "Strong Echo" buff to bring you to pre-EW stats
[0:17:04] <%zyberion626> I heard dungeon exp is so good rn, it might be better than bozja if you have a dedicated party
[0:17:05] <%Screwdatguy> @JustAnotherMuffin  ya he is a good way in
[0:17:15] <Blank9> @kid_flashionable My friends saw a couple wipes from the first 2 bosses
[0:17:29] <%kid_flashionable> oof! that stinks!
[0:17:29] <JustAnotherMuffin> @Screwdatguy Is he past the 3rd zone?
[0:17:37] <Jakeawienas> Keep getting 2002 ;(
[0:17:40] <+FiggityFiggityFox> still no 2002 yet but I'm waiting.
[0:17:52] <+Akizea> @JustAnotherMuffin he is past garlemald yes
[0:17:53] <%Monkeyweed21> @JustAnotherMuffin just did the lvl 83 trial
[0:17:54] <%Screwdatguy> Uhhhh not sure. I missed last nights stream
[0:17:55] <%legendfather_of_giants> @JustAnotherMuffin he's about halfway through the 4th zone
[0:17:58] <%InternetShis> No 2002 for me since launch but I know it's coming
[0:18:02] <%SveriSageAdvice> im at 674 but im expecting the 2002 error to boot my ass out again
[0:18:09] <xxshadowxx416> @Jakeawienas me
[0:18:11] <Blank9> sage feels like scholar but instead of pet you get to just press an instacast, 1 second recast buff button
[0:18:16] <%SveriSageAdvice> i should've gotten up early like i did every day
[0:18:22] <Blank9> it even has art of war
[0:18:25] <%SveriSageAdvice> this is *entirely* my fault
[0:18:26] <%Screwdatguy> @InternetShis keep that energy. You are immune to it
[0:18:53] <%Screwdatguy> im convinced moving the queue window keeps away 2002s and I dont know why
[0:19:06] <+FiggityFiggityFox> was fine early morning. guessing everything picks up around 10am or so.
[0:19:07] <%AHomeschoolDropout> Literally solo'd one of the bosses in the dungeon coming up as a PLD, they made magic actually better than using your sword for grouping enemies since both now heal
[0:19:43] <Blank9> I wonder if the way they fix dark knight is just make all the extreme raids pure magic damage
[0:20:11] <%legendfather_of_giants> @AHomeschoolDropout PLD's magic phase was stronger than the phys phase in ShB too, they actually equalized them in strength to add the heal
[0:20:15] <+FiggityFiggityFox> I really wanna get my PLD maxed but GNB first then WHM.
[0:20:16] <%zyberion626> well the devs explained 2002's happened for two reasons: 1. the 17k login queue is full. 2. your internet connection suffered packet loss
[0:20:20] <%valriot> I figured out my lobby error, which apparently is doing anything involving the internet at all, but limited only on my PC. So you are being watched on smelly mobile app and it's fine.
[0:20:24] <%SveriSageAdvice> i hate that i am getting more anxious about the number getting closer to 1, makes me feel like im going to get kicked out any moment now
[0:20:25] <Jakeawienas> YEA got into queue finallt
[0:20:26] <%KineticZen> Hey there
[0:20:32] <Guardiansaiyan> your still DEAD
[0:20:39] <+FiggityFiggityFox> Probobly gonna keep dancer as my dps but I haven't decided fully yetm
[0:20:49] <%legendfather_of_giants> @AHomeschoolDropout Plus their magic buff during Resquiecat no longer buffs clemency
[0:20:51] <%Screwdatguy> The fear of getting scolded is real
[0:20:52] <Blank9> @SveriSageAdvice if you get 2002'd, just reconnect fast as you can and you'll keep your spot in queue
[0:20:53] <%delilah4you> Pat how do you keep yourself logged in?
[0:21:02] <+Drspiderskull92> have you got a chance to look at monk?
[0:21:05] <Bardofkeys> These sorta "Where the fuck else can this possibly go" plots are always the best
[0:21:08] <grimm_hatter> still cant play, its insane
[0:21:15] <%delilah4you> ...what does that mea
[0:21:18] <Guardiansaiyan> nice
[0:21:21] <Blank9> you can also interrupt requiescat since it's stacks of 5 for a longer time, instead of a time period

[0:25:53] <%sirisvirus> @PatStaresAt hunt mount is Victor mount which is a battle dog
[0:25:57] <%legendfather_of_giants> @PatStaresAt gamerscape already has a page for it with a picture, I would link it but no links here
[0:26:00] <%SpcOpsBear> I am also watching because ahead, and also in queues
[0:26:05] <%VictorVonLouche> The Team did good with their promotion of this game, that trial was not expected.
[0:26:06] <%Monkeyweed21> I believe its just the Garlean Canis enemy model with the armor being fancy and gold
[0:26:18] <MidnightPacif1c> salHullo
[0:26:24] <OpenYourEels4TheNextFeels> I'm okay with spoilers, so I'll go search for if there is a bulldog mount & what colour it is.

[0:31:38] <MidnightPacif1c> some stuff happen
[0:31:41] <%X2Eliah> dont forget that hyda is now the big evil
[0:31:42] <RushUnplugged> I can't believe Funny Daniel actually had a plan
[0:31:43] <+Dwarven_Gaming> good news: i won
[0:31:44] <$linkthoy> I just beat the trial holy shit!
[0:31:45] <%transporterthesequel> To be fair to Fancy Dan, it WAS a good plan
[0:31:47] <+Dwarven_Gaming> bad news: i won
[0:31:53] <%Screwdatguy> God the facial hair on the bunny looks so so weird
[0:31:55] <%zyberion626> "I also became a bunny, it was weird."
[0:32:05] <%MonsterEnvy> Well no Amon killed Zodiark
[0:32:09] <RushUnplugged> Faniel Daniel
[0:32:11] <%shootbang_exe> to be fair fandaniel offed himself as zodiark
[0:32:16] <%StephanieSadGirl> ADHD be like that
[0:32:31] <+amUusTV> Just say the name like really quickly, 3 seconds, before you die in the next cutscene
[0:32:31] <%RealThiele> LORE TIME
[0:32:47] <$EsotericOdyssey> damn daniel
[0:32:48] <2Sam4Hall> I'm a little confused. Couldn't fandaniel or zenos have come here and freed zodiark at any time? Why did they need the towers?
[0:32:54] <Edible_Enthusiasm> pretty robe
[0:32:55] <%X2Eliah> Imagine if this sets up the upcoming KILL CHAOS FF prequel
[0:33:02] <%Screwdatguy> I think the moon energy made me a furry idk
[0:33:03] <%MonsterEnvy> music seems off
[0:33:03] <%RealThiele> big ear energy
[0:33:09] <@goose_attack_almanac> Pat changed from a Hunk to a Twunk
[0:33:12] <+BIumen> @2Sam4Hall zodiark wasnt done cooking
[0:33:15] <%AHomeschoolDropout> @patstaresat Dude in my FC showed it, it's one of those dogs you fought leading to Garlemald
[0:33:16] <%transporterthesequel> @2Sam4Hall Needed enough Aether to brute force blast the seal.
[0:33:24] <%X2Eliah> @2Sam4Hall they needed to boomboom the locks
[0:33:28] <RushUnplugged> @2Sam4Hall they needed to overpower the barriers
[0:33:29] <%zyberion626> @2sam4hall they needed a bunch of aether to destroy Hydaelyn's seal
[0:33:30] <$EsotericOdyssey> @2Sam4Hall maybe the watcher guy could repair the brands faster than they could physically break them if they all started intact
[0:33:32] <@QueequegTheater> @PatStaresAt Have you noticed how much better all the sheathe/unsheathe animations are
[0:33:34] <SaltyAzteca> Youre turning into a moon rabbit or something
[0:33:36] <%AHomeschoolDropout> Yea
[0:33:38] <%valriot> Pugnax
[0:33:38] <%sirisvirus> ya
[0:33:39] <%legendfather_of_giants> yeah just the standard dog enemy
[0:33:40] <%RealThiele> so pugmax
[0:33:50] <%Monkeyweed21> GARLEGIEF
[0:33:50] <$EsotericOdyssey> @2Sam4Hall and it helps to have a bunch broken at once
[0:33:51] <%transporterthesequel> In cutscenes
[0:33:55] <+Akizea> @QueequegTheater in cutscenes yeah
[0:33:58] <+Solutha> just in cutscene
[0:33:59] <%transporterthesequel> He means, the basic ones are still basic
[0:34:00] <+Dwarven_Gaming> in cutscenes
[0:34:03] <RushUnplugged> they only play in cutscenes, which is a shame
[0:34:04] <@QueequegTheater> EW
[0:34:07] <+Dwarven_Gaming> theres a special unsheath animation
[0:34:13] <+Amaterasu_Nyan> DNC is so good.
[0:34:14] <%Solareon_> oh yeah my NIN unsheathes one at a time, like a normal person
[0:34:14] <%AHomeschoolDropout> but yeah it's one of those gray ones
[0:34:15] <%valriot> Yeah the gave every Jon unique animations
[0:34:19] <%Screwdatguy> Thats so fucking cute
[0:34:21] <%SveriSageAdvice> oh my god, he is super needy today lol
[0:34:25] <%SveriSageAdvice> adorable
[0:34:27] <%baka_sugoi> psaDogchamp
[0:34:29] <%Screwdatguy> Hey @QueequegTheater !
[0:34:29] <%MonsterEnvy> I just realized that the Garlemald magitek walkers are totally based on Chocobos
[0:34:30] <@QueequegTheater> Samurai and RDM got the biggest upgrades
[0:34:32] <BabyNaBackbrace> Stop playing the game and just play with Gief
[0:34:34] <RushUnplugged> he's a grumper
[0:34:38] <%StephanieSadGirl> look at that tomgue
[0:34:55] <%transporterthesequel> yeaH MAN
[0:34:55] <RushUnplugged> yeah sam does a cool iai draw, rdm gets fancier
[0:35:04] <%RealThiele> Day 127546356: Some idiots dethroned god
[0:35:05] <%Screwdatguy> oh god the moon is weird
[0:35:07] <%transporterthesequel> Red halo's of doom, TOTEs normal.
[0:35:10] <$EsotericOdyssey> I'M IN
[0:35:16] <+Dwarven_Gaming> yep
[0:35:23] <+Dwarven_Gaming> in cutscenes theres a longer one
[0:35:30] <%GallowsDrop> I didn't even realize you changed race lol
[0:35:33] <%transporterthesequel> WAR's one is not that fancy.
[0:35:38] <@QueequegTheater> In cutscenes
[0:35:40] <+Akizea> yeah ninja has a really sick animation of drawing their daggers
[0:35:40] <%furiousfurioso> it's more deliberate, slower animations
[0:35:41] <%transporterthesequel> SAM is SUPER fancy.
[0:35:43] <%Monkeyweed21> you do it all the time
[0:35:44] <+Akizea> (in cutscenes)
[0:35:45] <%cobalt_phoenix_> oh shit he a bnuuy
[0:35:47] <TioXyco> OH! you dropped the had for being a bunny boy? unnexpected
[0:35:51] <$OranHexthief> yeah they have brushed up the cutscene version of weapon draws so they aren't so snappy any more and look a little more natural
[0:35:58] <Angry_Ev1L> it's true they changed aniamtion for books and it's quite apparent
[0:35:59] <TioXyco> *the hat
[0:36:01] <Edible_Enthusiasm> I wonder if zodiark savage will have them fully rejoined
[0:36:06] <Angry_Ev1L> wish it wasn't cutscenes only tho lol
[0:36:11] <%GallowsDrop> try paying attention to the sheathing animations next time someone does one it's clear that they're all new
[0:36:40] <TioXyco> @Edible_Enthusiasm possibly, full powered dark dad crystal
[0:36:59] <%Monkeyweed21> YEA DONT KILL GOD GUYS
[0:37:22] <%transporterthesequel> to be fair, he KINDA got possessed and killed himself

[0:38:33] <%Eaglestrike117> Like killing Zodiark hasnt rejoined anything so nothin really changes on the power scale i believe
[0:38:34] <%MonsterEnvy> It's not your fault pat it was Amon
[0:38:41] <%RealThiele> "Real bad."

[0:48:21] <%Solareon_> @zyberion626 well, if they end up having to move it, the planet was already fucked anyway
[0:48:23] <%MonsterEnvy> Also if the Planet dies who cares
[0:48:23] <Tracazoid> Bahamut coming down would've fucked shit up already if that were the case
[0:48:24] <Edible_Enthusiasm> what about night and day though
[0:48:25] <+Akizea> argos is incredible

[1:16:45] <DusK_The_Stray> Thisnis literally not a bad thing at all
[1:16:46] <AllenDeadman> well yeah
[1:16:48] <%Wulfphelz> Everyone making fucky wuckies LUL

[1:16:56] <AllenDeadman> it's just gonna take more time
[1:16:57] <Treasure_Vault> We can save 1/3rd of... ALL of you
[1:17:03] <%Screwdatguy> WAIT YOU PEOPLE BREATH AIR!?
[1:17:05] <%zyberion626> I like how this is very heavy lore exposition, but it's supplanted with cute buns
[1:17:05] <MKII> leave things as they are but build lots more step stools
[1:17:08] <+MelodyMedley> Yeah...
[1:17:12] <@goose_attack_almanac> I like that the Scions have seen so much shit that being on the moon and small rabbit people and the moon being fakejust doesn't phase htem
[1:17:14] <@CreepyPorpoise> Client didn't lay out the scope of the project well enough
[1:17:16] <%RealThiele> lil fucky wucky
[1:17:17] <@QueequegTheater> Shit happens
[1:17:18] <%Screwdatguy> "What do you mean you need plumbing!?"
[1:17:22] <%shurtal> shennanigans are always appreciated

[1:17:27] <GeltonZ> I just love Japan's INSISTANCE on there being bunnies on the moon!
[1:17:28] <DensityD> x4 "i love them"
[1:17:33] <Edible_Enthusiasm> you ever see the movie Passengers
[1:17:35] <Arxel1> This IS a good breather for the future LUL
[1:17:35] <%transporterthesequel> MUST PROTECT TINY BUNNIES
[1:17:36] <%JoshManVGH> That's how we crashed a lander into mars. Not enough information communicated between teams
[1:17:36] <AllenDeadman> same
[1:17:38] <+MelodyMedley> Carrot juice!
[1:17:39] <%RealThiele> of course its carrot juice
[1:17:39] <GeltonZ> ...and it's playing FF4 music. NICE.
[1:17:44] <+FiggityFiggityFox> number 450, so close to being able to get on!
[1:17:45] <DensityD> the moon is for usagi
[1:17:46] <%zyberion626> fun fact wild carrots aren't orange
[1:17:49] <DensityD> that's just the law of nature
[1:17:54] <%transporterthesequel> BunnyDAD pat MUST PROTECT HIS ADORABLE CHILDREN.
[1:17:55] <DensityD> yellow?
[1:17:55] <+ThomasOfTroy> 3 times the people probably requires disproportionately more food, air, waste removal, etc
[1:18:01] <MKII> The toilets would be unusable
[1:18:03] <%ChronoWave> What do you mean you don't just drink carrot juice?
[1:18:03] <%Screwdatguy> How are you going to warn the entire world to go to the moon and people believe you
[1:18:04] <Zebroneath> How long before you'll have them as house keepers?  kmaNyoom

[1:18:28] <arkv01> yeah this isn't a star trek destroyer unless the moon's gonna transform
[1:18:28] <%Birdigalore> I think the ark is what the people will use to get to the moon
[1:18:28] <%sirisvirus> the Magus Sisters as well
[1:18:29] <%Reilata> "And you all bought it!"
[1:18:30] <+MoonObscure> Jebaited

[1:18:32] <%RealThiele> they spoiled nothing aye
[1:18:33] <DensityD> JESUS BLESS THEM THEY DIDN'T spoil it from the trailers FOR ONCE
[1:18:34] <+Rewrench> When they had to remake the terrible original FF14. maybe this was the plan all along to leave on the moon? like it was the first thought in the process
[1:18:35] <$realm_forge> You see livingway, there’s something called anime and it used to be good, but has since caused the collapse of society
[1:18:37] <+Kyma1020> That's not the moon Pat
[1:18:38] <%GrayMatterMiner> GrayMatterMiner subscribed with Prime. They've subscribed for 31 months! 31 months down [REDACTED] left to go. Hope you have fun with your internet game
[1:18:42] <AllenDeadman> they barely showed us... not even the halfway point

[1:18:48] <Edible_Enthusiasm> I thought Sharleyen were working on a spaceship, and thats what they were keeping hidden.
[1:18:49] <%transporterthesequel> Don't worry, Hydalyn will take you
[1:18:51] <%AHomeschoolDropout> YOU KILL ZODIARK AS THE FIRST TRIAL
[1:18:53] <tanithmagnus> is the arc coming OUT of the Moom?
[1:18:58] <%watts121> I though it was the Void Ark and the Scions were gonna repurpose it as a space ship. And it would force everyone who hadn't to finish the Void Ark raid
[1:18:59] <dan_g_v> and then you finish it up halfwayt
[1:18:59] <Edible_Enthusiasm> but noooo, the moon is the ship @-@
[1:19:01] <@CreepyPorpoise> WOW
[1:19:04] <+MelodyMedley> Zodiark is already gone too
[1:19:05] <%ChronoWave> are they going to pull a FFXV and change the logo at the end?

[2:11:29] <sirrice77> he loves keeping secrets from his friends while he tells himself it's for their benefit
[2:11:34] <%shurtal> DE JAVU, i have been in this place before
[2:11:39] <%Ynkubus_> Urianger shant be bereft of his wiles
[2:11:57] <TimetodiveLTX> theme of .wad manager
[2:12:03] <$Falilth> Urianger will do devil drugs and lie about it if its for the greater good
[2:12:07] <%AtomicHeartSon> "These secrets doth not be for mine benefit, it doth be for mine friends."
[2:12:14] <TrollKing96> I can only imagine what was going through Hydaelyn's mind when she made the caretakers of what is essentially an Ark cute bunbuns.

[2:14:59] <+FinetiSonata> BUT KITES THO
[2:15:01] <marvel877> Woolie
[2:15:01] <%UvBenServed> Us :)
[2:15:02] <Treasure_Vault> Woolie has gone past not caring about 14 to kind of meta caring about 14.
[2:15:04] <%AtomicHeartSon> @QueequegTheater This is the REAL omegabrain. Double stream it.
[2:15:05] <ape_hawk> just keep saying "thats crazy" to each other
[2:15:05] <TimetodiveLTX> a fine game
[2:15:06] <xxshadowxx416> woolie
[2:15:06] <%trancecarlito> if you sub now you get a free week
[2:15:09] <Sol_Install> kites?
[2:15:09] <%JohnAtDawn> Has Woolie ever stated WHY he refuses to try 14? It can't just be an mmo thing, he played WoW.
[2:15:11] <KeeValentine> What if they add kites to ff14?
[2:15:17] <sirrice77> @dan_g_v also the rabbits are bad at certain parts of their job, possibly from misunderstanding things
[2:15:18] <%ElkRiverDog> Neither you'll both fail
[2:15:19] <%JoshManVGH> No matter who loses, chat wind
[2:15:21] <%Dregon_Azure> you should get woolie a FF14 kite
[2:15:21] <xxshadowxx416> woolle lier
[2:15:21] <Defm551> @Defm551 ah gotcha, good to know
[2:15:25] <%DavidCrimsonHeidern> delay podcast
[2:15:25] <+Orangeoff> real mmoheads are down with kiting
[2:15:26] <%zyberion626> @mildly_eccentric you joke but that's actually an apt comparison
[2:15:27] <%cooldude69xx> Have you tried relating FF14 to kites?
[2:15:28] <dan_g_v> oh didnt notice Pat was a twink bun
[2:15:34] <Edible_Enthusiasm> Sneaking on friend
[2:15:36] <ape_hawk> @KeeValentine what if they add ff14 to kites?
[2:15:37] <tanarath> @keevalentine they have
[2:15:40] <%NotVeryLegendary> Easy solution. Kites... in 14
[2:15:45] <%legendfather_of_giants> @JohnAtDawn "it's poison to me" just like almost anything that's not a fighting/hack'n'slash game
[2:15:45] <jubejube56> Stealth mission on the moon?
[2:15:46] <$Falilth> you can't escape the judgment trailing missions
[2:15:49] <+FinetiSonata> Pat's a twinx rabbit now
[2:15:57] <%Axellogic> I was picking up sushi why are we stalking talky man
[2:16:03] <%DavidCrimsonHeidern> none
[2:16:03] <%solracc25> rabbit pat
[2:16:05] <vicar_anat> "What was that sound?...Must be my imagination...."
[2:16:08] <%Axellogic> what did he do this time
[2:16:11] <ape_hawk> "why does that rock have bunny ears?"
[2:16:17] <%trancecarlito> @DavidCrimsonHeidern back on his bullshit
[2:16:18] <+Rewrench> has Pat said why he is a bunyy now?
[2:16:20] <%AnIcedCoffee> someone made a spreadsheet for fem viera and hroth so one will get made for males
[2:16:21] <%count_bob> @Axellogic he lying. Again
[2:16:21] <+fetrigon> @johnatdawn intrinsic motivation and their isn't any hitstop in combat animations.
[2:16:28] <%UvBenServed> Uri is being a sussy baka
[2:16:30] <dan_g_v> @sirrice77 guess a few thousand years without supervision may cause some misunderstandings on the bunnies
[2:16:34] <Edible_Enthusiasm> what was that noise?
[2:16:34] <+FinetiSonata> @Axellogic because he LOVES secrets and lies
[2:16:42] <sirrice77> @JohnAtDawn He has specifically said he hates games where you do damage and a number pops up. Lack of impact is something he hates, also he values style over function as another thing
[2:16:48] <%legendfather_of_giants> @PatStaresAt you can be ona  mount for this and he still doesnt see you btw
[2:16:50] <%AnIcedCoffee> I LOVE AssCreed tailing missions
[2:16:54] <%solracc25> MMO stealth missions
[2:16:57] <%trancecarlito> WHY ARE YOU RUNNING
[2:17:17] <%zyberion626> @sirrice77 Woolie is also adverse to grinding
[2:17:17] <+Dwarven_Gaming> use the whale mount next time
[2:17:19] <dan_g_v> so, everybody can be on the moon, not just special plot people?
[2:17:20] <+Dwarven_Gaming> of the elephant
[2:17:23] <sirrice77> @dan_g_v basically until pat showed up they did not understand that the ancients are no longer around and that everyone is now short. They have also tried to make a forest without having ever seen a tree
[2:17:25] <%zyberion626> averse even
[2:17:28] <dan_g_v> on the surface, I mean
[2:17:30] <%UvBenServed> If height mattered here, my femroe would be pretty screwed
[2:17:30] <%AHomeschoolDropout> Just imaging a group of people hiding behind a rock with their stupid whale and car mounts and urianger not knowing whose behind it
[2:17:31] <+fetrigon> @sirrice77 ye much better than my half assed explanation LUL
[2:17:40] <Edible_Enthusiasm> time to beat him up
[2:17:49] <dan_g_v> @sirrice77 as it's wont to happen I suppose XD
[2:17:53] <nechronia> I feel like everyone in shout chat complains about these quests but they really dont seem that bad
[2:18:02] <+RTBexe> the mustache looks HORRIBLE lmao
[2:18:18] <tigerfang86> "yes"
[2:18:28] <dan_g_v> that means lying, right?
[2:18:58] <Edible_Enthusiasm> guilt
[2:19:07] <NinJaLeo> that's a lot of ocean
[2:19:19] <%Axellogic> Minfilla become such a better character once she was dead its weird
[2:19:20] <gespenst25> BibleThump
[2:19:25] <%zyberion626> Urianger has some massive survivors guilt
[2:19:30] <dan_g_v> so all that ocean will be where we get the next big arc, right?
[2:19:30] <%zyberion626> poor dude
[2:19:36] <+fetrigon> BibleThump
[2:19:37] <+FinetiSonata> it's okay funny man, we love you
[2:19:41] <dan_g_v> gonna do a pokemon and lower the oceans?
[2:19:42] <%RocketBarrel> @axellogic LMAOOO
[2:19:47] <$EsotericOdyssey> okay this scene alone gives me big "urianger dies" vibes
[2:20:01] <SaltyAzteca> THE GREATER GOOD
[2:20:09] <%count_bob> You weren't even there dude.

[2:31:52] <%monsieurfantastic> pats going off the rails
[2:31:54] <%kyh9> TALK MORE SHIT ABOUT HIM
[2:31:56] <DynzelWashington> Can we just bully Seth Rogan instead?
[2:32:04] <Treasure_Vault> i mean, i'd stop keeping shit in my car and give up after 15 times
[2:32:05] <+natjen8> and now you're gonna star in the mario movie
[2:32:05] <Sol_Install> yea
[2:32:06] <%SinnerEbru> if i could make a career from being a stoner i WOULD
[2:32:07] <TurtlesAndTentacles> Seth is a very wholesome guy who's stood up for tons of civil rights
[2:32:07] <%StephanieSadGirl> DESTROYED
[2:32:12] <%InternetShis> Yeah but the pot and pots
[2:32:13] <%emperordread> Pineapple Express is legit one of the worst movies I've ever seen
[2:32:18] <+OneGorillionDollars> i get the feeling pat doesnt like seth roegan
[2:32:20] <wolverinewaswrong> Can't believe there's two different Rogans saying stupid stuff online
[2:32:22] <%Monkeyweed21> but Pat, you also made a career off going "hue hue hue hue Rats cant swim"
[2:32:22] <Sol_Install> spitting facts
[2:32:23] <+nikoloas_> don't forget to leave them a knife
[2:32:27] <TurtlesAndTentacles> Seth is a great activist
[2:32:28] <%solracc25> you get a knife
[2:32:33] <dan_g_v> every dog should know how to break into cars at early age
[2:32:37] <%solracc25> sometimes
[2:32:39] <dan_g_v> essential skill for a dog's life
[2:32:42] <%DavidCrimsonHeidern> why is seth rogan dong again?
[2:32:42] <%shurtal> why break in to 15 cars one time when you can break into one car 15 times, its just more efficient
[2:32:43] <%kyh9> “DUDE, DONT CRITICIZE THE CITY WE LIVE IN OVER A LEGITIMATE CRIME AND ISSUE, I MIGHT HAVE TO ACKNOWLEDGE IM OUT OF TOUCH WITH THE COMMON MAN”
[2:33:59] <@QueequegTheater> @TurtlesAndTentacles And? He still told a guy who was traumatized over his car getting broken into "lmao get over it pussy"
[2:35:20] <egoat> its a bit much to like omit that that guy was being a wildly right wing reactionary over it
[2:35:23] <TurtlesAndTentacles> @queequegtheater did he? well I like to be on record for saying a person doing or saying one wrong thing (that doesn't harm anyone) should dictate how we view them or rewrite any good they've done
[2:35:50] <%StephanieSadGirl> Telling someone to 'get over it pussy' is doing harm
[2:36:01] <TurtlesAndTentacles> @egoat this is legit the first time I'm hearing about this
[2:36:23] <@QueequegTheater> He also responded to the criticism by claiming it was a bunch of white supremacists trying to cancel him
[2:36:29] <@QueequegTheater> Seth Rogen is an idiot
[2:36:55] <xxshadowxx416> in queue and it say this world is currently full
[2:37:24] <@QueequegTheater> @xxshadowxx416 The queue has a maximum limit, I think
[2:37:48] <TurtlesAndTentacles> I guess. I don't follow alot of celebrity stuff but when I see someone support a cause I like (BLM) I tend to see that. and that is the last I'm speaking on this cause I don't want chat to devolve into something else.
[2:38:31] <umbraawitch> i got six 2002 errors today :)
[2:38:43] <%nip_nips> those are rookie numbers
[2:38:44] <%StephanieSadGirl> I cant help but see a real difference between people without the means to activly help a cause, like most poor to lower middle class, and someone who has millions to their name just paying lip service to a cause...
[2:39:16] <xxshadowxx416> @umbraawitch how many times
[2:39:22] <@QueequegTheater> Let's not get further into this

[3:15:01] <SinisterBroccoli> most hats from the nier raids can be worn tho
[3:15:02] <%AHomeschoolDropout> the second dungeon's ushanka can be worn by viera tho
[3:15:04] <%Dakuu75> WHAT A NAME FOR A PLACE~! "Broken Glass" lol
[3:15:08] <+fetrigon> sorry they couldn't crunch it into existence. milord PunOko
[3:15:11] <Edible_Enthusiasm> finite daze
[3:15:18] <%DashXero> Camp Broken Ass...
[3:15:29] <%Dakuu75> ^
[3:15:35] <$0ddeye> Wish reaper didnt exist, still lots of final fantasy classes they haven't made yet. why make some new edge lord class
[3:15:43] <Edible_Enthusiasm> Fandaniel basically delt with himself
[3:15:45] <+fetrigon> @dashxero LUL
[3:15:55] <sirrice77> Actually now that i remember didn't Ardbert talk with Elidibus on the moon? Was he shown Zodiark?
[3:15:56] <Psyramics> and Zodiark, and the towers
[3:16:01] <%zyberion626> @patstaresat did you get the glasses fashion accessory at the Golden saucer?
[3:16:04] <Saltmeisterr> Fandanny ded
[3:16:05] <karl_rex> How are they going to get everyone to the Moon? Only the portal in Garlemald works
[3:16:09] <tigerfang86> I mean he did what he always wanted to do technically right
[3:16:12] <sirrice77> or am i remembering wrong?
[3:16:20] <%cobalt_phoenix_> @0ddeye as someone who never played another ff game besides this what else is there
[3:16:25] <%zyberion626> you can wear glasses with your other headgear now
[3:16:26] <%Dakuu75> @0ddeye what're we missing? don't we haver msot everything?
[3:16:28] <%Nervjc> I'm so glad he's gone
[3:16:38] <lostvayne91> his plan wasn't foiled
[3:16:44] <%JoshManVGH> @0ddeye It fulfilled a desire that's been present since FFXI. A Scyth wearing melee class with magic.
[3:17:10] <%cobalt_phoenix_> @sirrice77 he did talk on the moon, but i don't think they showed him showing ardbert  zodiark
[3:17:50] <SaltyAzteca> Oh thats convenient
[3:18:01] <%Dakuu75> Anima should've been a bigger deal, man
[3:18:02] <Edible_Enthusiasm> they all just fell out of the sky
[3:18:06] <dan_g_v> so it was Fandan stirring problems
[3:18:16] <%InternetShis> Lmao get fucked FFX
[3:18:25] <%Dakuu75> lol
[3:18:29] <%zyberion626> bruh.
[3:18:32] <tigerfang86> some shit
[3:18:35] <SaltyAzteca> MOON RABBITS YO
[3:18:38] <+Saggitori> who was on the moon
[3:18:39] <%VictorVonLouche> Moon is NOT haunted
[3:18:40] <+chimaera24> World's fucked
[3:18:41] <%InternetShis> Lots
[3:18:45] <SForlord> Maxima looks like the dude who played Soul Calibur at my community college.
[3:18:48] <$0ddeye> @Dakuu75 Mystic Knight, Berserker, Time Mage, Geomancer, Beast Master. I'm sure there is more too
[3:18:50] <%InternetShis> I killed god. I shouldn't have.
[3:18:54] <MKII> somebody caused the final days, we're still investigating internally
[3:19:09] <dan_g_v> so killing Satan was a bad idea?
[3:19:15] <%InternetShis> I investigated myself and found I did nothing wrong
[3:19:37] <sirrice77> @dan_g_v yes because it turns out Satan was holding the laws of nature together
[3:19:41] <%Monkeyweed21> @dan_g_v you killed old testament God not the devil
[3:19:41] <Zourath> @dan_g_v Yep, he was holding back Double Satan.
[3:19:52] <+D00msDayDan> we did it, we walked the end
[3:20:02] <dan_g_v> different answers but they all check :3
[3:20:05] <%Monkeyweed21> Zodiark wasnt Satan he was the Old Testament God thats a mean motherfucker
[3:20:11] <tigerfang86> got emmmmm
[3:20:26] <%Dakuu75> lol, finally. his FINAL FORM lol
[3:20:30] <Edible_Enthusiasm> he did kill his beloved father
[3:20:46] <@goose_attack_almanac> fuck, Zenos really is a murder hobo now
[3:20:50] <Guardiansaiyan> see ya in VOD
[3:21:14] <TrollKing96> To be fair, Satan got possesed and the guy possessing him killed himself during said possession.
[3:21:17] <+Shockrates20XX> @0ddeye Next DPS has to wear Scouting gear I'd presume, to spread out the gear. One of the reasons I was guessing Beastmaster before Reaper was announced.
[3:21:29] <Edible_Enthusiasm> Clatter, Smash, Distant Explosions
[3:21:31] <tigerfang86> Gun gun gun gun

[3:22:34] <Daniel_Is_I> "Moon's haunted."
[3:22:38] <+OneGorillionDollars> GUNMANCER
[3:23:04] <MKII> good news: we've killed the evil, bad news...
[3:23:05] <CruxAustralis> wait
[3:23:08] <+acridpaladin> theres no way our godslayer could have killed something on the moon haha
[3:23:10] <CruxAustralis> when did you become a bunny?
[3:23:23] <tigerfang86> hes on the moon, for moon reasons
[3:23:28] <%whyskeywolfe> he stayed on the moon to take care of the rabbits
[3:23:45] <%livlinn> shiaHypers
[3:23:54] <Eger007> fuck em shards
[3:23:59] <%DashXero> Is there even water on the Moon?
[3:24:08] <%livlinn> Pat is a hot bnnuy boi now
[3:24:21] <$0ddeye> @Shockrates20XX I realize Bard exists, but the game doesn't have nature based druid/ranger style archer, so Beast Master would be great
[3:24:22] <crascabaras> "So I got nothing'"
[3:24:41] <Edible_Enthusiasm> The Bunnies have creation magic :c
[3:25:01] <SaltyAzteca> The NTR questline resumes
[3:25:08] <StarMechV> Zodiark is gonna piss on the MOON
[3:25:11] <+slidshockingkrow> wild that we're this far in an still have no idea what we're up against
[3:25:16] <Edible_Enthusiasm> Many
[3:25:25] <%Solareon_> oh i got this cutscene at midday, this is way better at night
[3:25:30] <%Dakuu75> I wonder if FFXIV is gonna end like, every other FF. With GOD being the final boss
[3:25:31] <%zyberion626> @0ddeye pet AI has been a sore spot for a while so another pet class like SCH may be a while
[3:25:32] <+acridpaladin> man they look evil
[3:25:39] <%whyskeywolfe> I'm still not sure what's going on but these twinks seem awfully upset
[3:25:39] <%trancecarlito> "everyone come around.....we're fucked"
[3:25:44] <MKII> how are they going to explain all this without sounding crazy
[3:25:48] <SaltyAzteca> Odooor
[3:25:53] <tigerfang86> check out these guys totally not being evil
[3:25:54] <+Saggitori> big mouth looking mf
[3:26:05] <MKII> so there's these rabbit people and the moon is a spaceship
[3:26:15] <%zyberion626> Time for a "lottery"
[3:26:19] <%Dakuu75> why do they keep calling the planet a "star"
[3:26:20] <+hykonis> that’s a lot of characters on screen
[3:26:23] <karl_rex> Really had the least charismatic fucker make the speech
[3:26:32] <%Solareon_> @Dakuu75 it sounds cooler
[3:26:40] <Edible_Enthusiasm> Telopheroi are basically gone now aren't they?
[3:26:51] <%Dakuu75> @Solareon_ fair enough~
[3:26:57] <%DashXero> Oh goddammit. Didn't this need to be kept under wraps?
[3:26:58] <+hykonis> @dakuu75 Because the planets all shine like stars in the distance and it’s poetic
[3:26:59] <$0ddeye> @zyberion626 That's fair. I'm sure there is a more interesting class regardless then edgy scythe dude with bloodborne armor.
[3:27:02] <+D00msDayDan> endbearers, not endwalkers?
[3:27:04] <SaltyAzteca> DOOM. ALL OF YOU ARE DOOMED.
[3:27:15] <%DashXero> It doesn't rhyme.
[3:27:21] <+slidshockingkrow> getting some big evil vibes from these guys now
[3:27:21] <+FinetiSonata> they read the script
[3:27:22] <dan_g_v> so, are they the baddies?
[3:27:23] <%Dakuu75> @hykonis doodShake
[3:27:27] <Flame_Water> is that the hulk?
[3:27:31] <+Arrotal> Arrotal subscribed with Prime. They've subscribed for 24 months! 
[3:27:35] <dan_g_v> oh no, baddies song
[3:27:36] <%kyh9> So they're literally just Isaac Asimov's Foundation
[3:27:39] <+OneGorillionDollars> CAN WE KILL THIS GUY
[3:27:41] <%kyh9> The Forum is literally just the Foundation
[3:27:44] <%legendfather_of_giants> @PatStaresAt if these guys had helped before, Fandaniel probably would never had time to make it to the Moon and put this all in motion
[3:27:49] <%count_bob> "We need to do an ad read! Have you heard of doordash!"
[3:27:51] <%kyh9> They're making the Encyclopedia Galactica
[3:27:53] <Edible_Enthusiasm> now they can speak freely
[3:27:54] <tanarath> uhhh?
[3:27:59] <%zyberion626> TIME TO SPILL ALL THE BEANS
[3:27:59] <%Dakuu75> wut?
[3:28:03] <Saltmeisterr> What
[3:28:16] <Daxalog> I hope this isnt a red wedding..
[3:28:24] <%DashXero> Are they all fucking undead?
[3:28:24] <%Reilata> 'Hey guys, shits fucked and we're going to the moon'
[3:28:24] <tanarath> uh oh. That memory hole thing is dispelled.
[3:28:27] <%Dakuu75> wtf did that do?
[3:28:30] <%cobalt_phoenix_> "shit. is. fucked."
[3:28:32] <sirrice77> They all had the enchantment on them that prevented them from speaking of their sacred duty to those who do not know
[3:28:37] <%Birdigalore> I feel like this evil music isn't fitting since we know what they've been up to now
[3:28:39] <crascabaras> "AETHER ALIENS"
[3:28:49] <%zyberion626> @dakuu75 they were magically sworn to secrecy
[3:28:50] <+slidshockingkrow> they found the Noise
[3:28:51] <%nip_nips> "yeah so the moon is actually a spaceship controlled by little bunny people"
[3:28:52] <%Deft_Thought> Welp
[3:28:56] <%trancecarlito> "so we met god"
[3:29:00] <Saltmeisterr> SHIT
[3:29:02] <%valriot> OOPS FOUND GOD
[3:29:11] <karl_rex> They're ALL tempered
[3:29:13] <%nip_nips> OOPS KILLED HIM
[3:29:16] <%cobalt_phoenix_> DA MOOOON
[3:29:16] <%justcallmebobplease> A 'calamity' for one's star, you say...
[3:29:18] <%rekinom> Hollow Eorzea Theory confirmed
[3:29:20] <+FinetiSonata> apparently you can just dig to her
[3:29:23] <%zyberion626> GOD IS REAL AND WE'RE ALL FUCKED
[3:29:27] <Edible_Enthusiasm> the moon is made of HyperCheese
[3:29:32] <tanarath> Gotta get on the moon asap fuckers.
[3:29:35] <SaltyAzteca> MOONS FULL O' BUNNIES
[3:29:59] <%JohnAtDawn> Do you think the Sharlyans know their pen pals are bunny people? @PatStaresAt
[3:30:03] <artoflec> moon is made of carrot
[3:30:07] <%Nekros4442> mfers arent even gonna try to fix the problem itself are they
[3:30:10] <%Birdigalore> "So God is real.  Satan is dead, and the bunnies are your saviors!"
[3:30:14] <%DashXero> And cue the public panic.
[3:30:17] <%DashXero> Always timely.
[3:30:20] <%JoshManVGH> "We are working with mmmmmBUNNIES, wutwut."
[3:30:25] <dan_g_v> they definitely not know they are tiny cute bunnies who are hanging out with our lying friendo
[3:30:29] <tanarath> negative five seconds
[3:30:37] <%Dakuu75> everyone get on the magic school bus~
[3:30:52] <%legendfather_of_giants> oh FUCK OFF
[3:30:54] <%Birdigalore> Get fucked, reflections!

[3:31:00] <arkv01> FUCK U DAD
[3:31:02] <tigerfang86> "just RUN AWAY"
[3:31:10] <SaltyAzteca> FUKKEN PANIC
[3:31:23] <+slidshockingkrow> they're going to vote this asshole "emergency powers"
[3:31:23] <%nip_nips> they're taking the moon for themselves
[3:31:26] <karl_rex> No wonder they gave the rabbits such shit info they put this fucker in charge
[3:31:28] <%DashXero> That sounds about right.
[3:31:28] <%Dakuu75> unclear
[3:31:29] <%JohnAtDawn> :)
[3:31:31] <%JoshManVGH> That's my theory
[3:31:31] <StarMechV> sound like it
[3:31:33] <%Deft_Thought> Seems that way
[3:31:36] <SaltyAzteca> It definitely FEELS that way
[3:31:36] <tanarath> 'We'll be able to go somewhere else, it'll be fine'
[3:31:37] <+OneGorillionDollars> PROBABLY LUL
[3:31:38] <crascabaras> "We gon be space jews"
[3:31:38] <tigerfang86> I mean I can buy that
[3:31:39] <Ghufufin> the chosen ones
[3:31:40] <%legendfather_of_giants> its unclear
[3:31:41] <karl_rex> Sounds like it
[3:31:41] <%count_bob> Yup
[3:31:43] <arkv01> yeah its unlikely all of eorzea would fit
[3:31:44] <xbb1024> yes
[3:31:49] <%Nekros4442> seems unclear
[3:31:49] <%zyberion626> yup, bailing on an ark is LITERALLY their creation myth @patstaresat
[3:31:51] <%whyskeywolfe> The Council of Twinks has spoken
[3:31:51] <@Moobot> Hey folks, just a reminder! If you have Twitch connected to Discord, you can access the PSA Sub-Discord. Go to your User Settings, go to Connections, and click 'Join' on the PSA server under the Twitch connection.
[3:31:54] <%JoshManVGH> Seems like the bullshit they would do, looking back at Emits intro for the area.
[3:31:56] <%Deft_Thought> Some real Elon Musk energy
[3:31:59] <fatalDestiny> Given they didn't help stop all the wars going on, so everyone could evacuate peacefully, I think we can assume so.
[3:32:03] <ohno778> this evil ass music...
[3:32:04] <%nip_nips> they think they're better than everyone else, and dont want those barbarian warring nations to come with them
[3:32:10] <+FinetiSonata> only 17,000 people can fit at a time
[3:32:11] <NinJaLeo> time to get your Spaces Tickets for the MoonShip
[3:32:24] <%whyskeywolfe> What do you mean you didn't trust that incredibly sinister music?
[3:32:25] <Edible_Enthusiasm> How are they even going to get to the moon
[3:32:25] <17sevens> @fatalDestiny asking a single country to stop every war every is kind of fucking much
[3:32:28] <%Birdigalore> "All major institutions" soo maybe they're communicating with other nations?
[3:32:32] <%Nervjc> "heyo the world is ending. now carry on with your day"
[3:32:40] <%Cactuskris> it´s really final fantasy 2012
[3:32:44] <arkv01> ahh so hes a good daddy but still a bad person

[3:32:52] <%trancecarlito> the world is ending go clock in tommorrow
[3:32:56] <SaltyAzteca> Well thats a no brainer
[3:33:07] <ohno778> You're dad is still an asshole im sorry....
[3:33:09] <%Axellogic> bunny pat is weird
[3:33:14] <%justcallmebobplease> Pat's big dead eyes on a bunny man with moppy hair is just the best.

[3:33:44] <%OneGorillionDollars> OneGorillionDollars subscribed with Prime. They've subscribed for 2 months! I feel as though this is knowledge other world leaders would benefit from

[3:34:59] <dan_g_v> ooooh!
[3:35:02] <%Solareon_> it rhymes
[3:35:06] <gespenst25> it's like poetry, it rhymes

[3:37:03] <jubejube56> It’s weird how little antagonist there is atm
[3:37:03] <$0ddeye> I guess I prefer Alph to Thancred but they are both so boringly designed
[3:37:03] <StarMechV> i wasn't even looking at him
[3:37:06] <@goose_attack_almanac> which country has batarians
[3:37:08] <%nip_nips> they're not 16/17, they're like 25 now
[3:37:12] <Edible_Enthusiasm> hopefully Garlamald
[3:37:18] <ohno778> FUCK BATARIANS
[3:37:19] <%Solareon_> fingers crossed for Limsa but just the aethertye plaza
[3:37:19] <karl_rex> Mor Dohna?
[3:37:22] <SaltyAzteca> LMAO
[3:37:25] <%JoshManVGH> Aww can't be Limsa they got it first last time.
[3:37:27] <%OrangeMDT> @sirrice77 ooh. They were saying they weren’t kids, and I was looking at them like, “no, you are literally children”
[3:37:27] <%vivaldiva> LUL
[3:37:28] <Major_Lee_> what are the batarians of ff14
[3:37:33] <Saltmeisterr> Limsa Balls
[3:37:34] <Edible_Enthusiasm> Mor Dohna makes sense
[3:37:41] <arkv01> hey man thats lacist batarians are people too PunOko
[3:37:43] <%Cozy90> Hi everyone!
[3:37:51] <Edible_Enthusiasm> Oh.
[3:37:52] <%count_bob> Garlamald.
[3:37:56] <%VictorVonLouche> Yeah it would be the last bastion if so
[3:38:08] <Saltmeisterr> why
[3:38:10] <%JoshManVGH> Celestial Aether though, as Quequeag pointed out
[3:38:11] <+Solutha> yeah just look at the map of the first
[3:38:16] <jorniev> are we starting?
[3:38:18] <Daniel_Is_I> Celestial aether is upper atmosphere, I don't think it has to do with the aether on the ground.
[3:38:21] <Saltmeisterr> what's special about mor donna
[3:38:21] <%zyberion626> I though the Burn was tapped of Aether?
[3:38:24] <+FinetiSonata> would anyone even notice if it hit the burn?
[3:38:26] <dan_g_v> time for divine messages?
[3:38:27] <jubejube56> Space aether
[3:38:29] <Psyramics> its the celestial aether thats the problem, not the land or air aether
[3:38:30] <tigerfang86> oh no MOON EVIL
[3:38:32] <jorniev> OH SHIT PAT IS A BUN
[3:38:33] <@QueequegTheater> @PatStaresAt The Burn is terrestrial aether, not celestial
[3:38:37] <%OneGorillionDollars> have they explained *why* the aether is corrupted yet?
[3:38:38] <%sirisvirus> most important choice ever coming

[3:38:52] <Major_Lee_> who could it be?

[3:54:15] <smward87> 7. This is the start of the 8th @BigYanno
[3:54:27] <Daniel_Is_I> Oh that's WORSE than before.
[3:54:29] <%Dakuu75> WELCOME TO YHARNAM~~!
[3:54:31] <Xenodile> technically this would be number 9, but we averted one from happening
[3:54:33] <Zeif00> oh
[3:54:33] <%RealThiele> cotton eyed joe
[3:54:35] <jorniev> PEOPLE PROBABLY
[3:54:42] <jorniev> YUP
[3:54:42] <Make_me_mad> So the moon ship is fucked if one person changes.
[3:54:45] <%UvBenServed> Good question
[3:54:49] <%Nervjc> Despair?
[3:54:50] <smward87> true @Xenodile
[3:54:51] <%DashXero> Fear the Old Blood.
[3:54:53] <ohno778> This is bloodborne now
[3:54:53] <BigYanno> It's determined by their social credit score
[3:54:54] <Edible_Enthusiasm> are there any beastmen left?
[3:54:55] <Zeif00> 🤔
[3:54:55] <jorniev> IF YOU LET IT SET IN
[3:54:57] <AllenDeadman> toes?
[3:54:59] <Daxalog> "They are ugly"
[3:55:00] <%Nekros4442> So no creation magicks so the people themselves change?
[3:55:06] <+toastybites> "we first thought it was lupus, but we have since learned"
[3:55:08] <+Kyma1020> LETTING IT SET IN
[3:55:08] <Ghufufin> twitter conquest?
[3:55:14] <jubejube56> They probably transform unless they are next to a radio
[3:55:25] <jorniev> DON'T LET IT SET IN
[3:55:28] <%VictorVonLouche> People go boom
[3:55:38] <+solomonpun> So maybe primals that feed on fear? Like a reverse-primal?
[3:55:44] <%Monkeyweed21> @PatStaresAt summoning is just shitty creation magic
[3:55:47] <SaltyAzteca> Literal Mind Goblins?
[3:55:56] <%ElkRiverDog> Anxiety literally kills you
[3:56:01] <AllenDeadman> maybe
[3:56:08] <%zyberion626> despair and fear seem to be the mind killers here
[3:56:12] <AllenDeadman> it's either that or a dark souls hollow situation
[3:56:13] <%AHomeschoolDropout> This is way worse than the First holy shit
[3:56:34] <Edible_Enthusiasm> the sky is falling
[3:56:36] <tanarath> They're primals created by depression, despair, and belief in the end of the world.
[3:56:37] <+HaloIsA> IS THIS THE DUDE FROM CASTLEVANIA
[3:56:40] <Treasure_Vault> lamirp

[3:57:05] <+HaloIsA> My grandchild is stuck in the catacombs
[3:57:16] <+M0untain_wolf> NOD
[3:57:18] <tanarath> The mage college literally started an Apocalypse cult at the worst time

[3:57:29] <%JoshManVGH> I appreciate the weather designation they give in this area.

[4:02:19] <%JoshManVGH> @dsarhana "You goofed and that area is closed to you forever"
[4:02:19] <Xenodile> I logged into Crystal at like 9am pst and the queue was only like 40, but then my ISP died and I can't get back in

[4:03:24] <@QueequegTheater> thavnair
[4:03:31] <+Kyma1020> Only Thavnair has the sky
[4:03:36] <karl_rex> Shouldn't this be triggering a lot of people to awaken to the Echo?
[4:03:39] <%legendfather_of_giants> @PatStaresAt there is one that's an A rank hunt
[4:04:04] <dsarhana> @JoshManVGH "Nice job dumbass, you crashed the economy"

[4:05:25] <%Dakuu75> TOO MUCH INSIGHT

[4:05:27] <%VictorVonLouche> GOOD TRAILER THEN
[4:05:30] <AllenDeadman> misdirection
[4:05:32] <%Reilata> This totally looks like somewhere you want to stay and not just fuck of to the moon for.
[4:05:35] <AllenDeadman> to it's finest
[4:05:43] <%Reilata> off*
[4:05:43] <%Nekros4442> Good trailer
[4:05:45] <%Aeoneth> Bruhg he said the respite afforded this land was but brief
[4:05:53] <dan_g_v> rather than avoid spoilers, make tons of fake spoilers
[4:05:58] <Xenodile> Watchers that have played FGO might recognize this as Absolute Demonic Front Babylonia Kappa
[4:05:59] <xxshadowxx416> queue maybe 6 hours
[4:06:15] <%Nekros4442> Vritra is so cool
[4:06:18] <DarkCloud79> The respite was the tower going down, and then this happens
[4:06:21] <@QueequegTheater> BibleThump
[4:06:22] <Zeif00> Vrtra FeelsBadMan
[4:06:22] <sirrice77> @Xenodile i see i'm not the only one. Hopefully there will be more survivors here than in that
[4:06:28] <+Kyma1020> I like that they keep some voice actors for other roles because they're that good
[4:06:30] <%trancecarlito> this is literally the DAY after the towers were stopped
[4:06:36] <AllyBeeBoo> he sounds a bit like the dragon from dragons dogma
[4:06:38] <+Citizen_Cryo> Vtra such a softie
[4:06:55] <+Kyma1020> Vtra is such a dad
[4:07:25] <Srthunda> I love this part of the dungeon
[4:07:26] <smward87> both just use a shit ton of reverb on their voices to make them sound big and dragony lol @AllyBeeBoo
[4:07:26] <xxshadowxx416> am  940
[4:07:28] <dsarhana> @trancecarlito It's almost comically how quickly everything went to shit

[4:08:12] <%KineticZen> Healers just get to do more DAMAGE
[4:08:12] <dsarhana> I'm genuinely curious how they solve this cause... THIS AIN'T LOOKIN LIKE YOU CAN
[4:08:18] <%KineticZen> Especially Sage, I can't wait to level that after the story
[4:08:23] <tanarath> @ohno778 we have fire like 10 months out of the year.
[4:08:42] <tanarath> And I think you mean most of the US.
[4:08:53] <+fetrigon> @dsarhana I hope they're ballsy enough to do a reset. LUL
[4:08:56] <%Nervjc> fucking knew it
[4:08:58] <tigerfang86> if you despair over the apocalypse you become the apocalypse???
[4:09:00] <%RealThiele> uno hombre
[4:09:01] <tigerfang86> that's some shit
[4:09:02] <+FinetiSonata> good feels only
[4:09:02] <@SpaceCapnCrone> the damage spike is on the 7's for Heavensward and Shadowbringers
[4:09:03] <tanarath> But this is Australia during the summer, ye.
[4:09:04] <%Nervjc> They will show us despair
[4:09:06] <%KineticZen> So this was the prequel to Dangan Ronpa
[4:09:06] <+Kyma1020> Literally don't let it set in
[4:09:10] <dsarhana> Oh I hate that
[4:09:10] <%valriot> Dis Pear
[4:09:11] <dsarhana> burn it
[4:09:14] <dsarhana> burn it right now
[4:09:15] <rosemon5001> but monokuma says despair is good and he is a cute mascot LUL
[4:09:18] <%cooldude69xx> @dsarhana They have been hinting that the next expansion is a "fresh start"
[4:09:19] <%bundle_of_herbs> yo what's this heartless shit
[4:09:20] <Blank9> vibe check
[4:09:25] <AllenDeadman> oh
[4:09:27] <AllenDeadman> so that's it
[4:09:29] <MidnightPacif1c> just had a pear it was yummy
[4:09:32] <Zeif00> WutFace
[4:09:32] <@QueequegTheater> Give them dis pear
[4:09:36] <%trancecarlito> this is litearlly the worst its ever been
[4:09:38] <AllenDeadman> WHAT THE FUCK
[4:09:38] <ohno778> lololololol
[4:09:39] <%InternetShis> Do NOT let it set in
[4:09:41] <+Kyma1020> CHUCKLE KNUCKLE NOOO
[4:09:41] <%InternetShis> Or else
[4:09:47] <ohno778> The floor is laughing at you
[4:09:48] <dsarhana> @dsarhana I mean shit, this is looklin realm-reborn tier end of the world
[4:09:52] <AllenDeadman> YEAH THIS IS HOLOWING BUT WORSE
[4:09:53] <%InternetShis> THIS IS SUCH A GOOD DUNGEON
[4:09:55] <tanarath> @tigerfang86 zodiark stabillized reality, so now legit anything is possible.
[4:09:57] <%Nekros4442> This remind anyone else of MuvLuv Alternative?
[4:09:58] <AllenDeadman> don't let it set in
[4:10:03] <MKII> read your cast bars
[4:10:07] <smward87> not hinting, they just flat out said as much. and not next expansion, but 6.1 @cooldude69xx
[4:10:15] <MKII> turning into monsters feels very madoka
[4:10:22] <%UvBenServed> YEYEYEYEYEYE
[4:10:26] <rosemon5001> ohh yea for anyone who cares the new danganronpa game that is based off the minigame dungeons of V3 is just like dokapon
[4:10:26] <tigerfang86> nice nightmare ground mouths
[4:10:40] <smward87> everything that has been building up since 2.0, ends in 6.0. the fresh start begins 6.1 @cooldude69xx
[4:10:55] <%NitronStreams> so the end of the world is basically that ds9 episode where they almost killed everyone with their imagination
[4:10:58] <Kain5707> macro left click to sprint
[4:10:58] <+detectivesai> are the red tankbuster markers just an EW thing or is it an overall QOL change?
[4:11:26] <@QueequegTheater> Just ShB/EW
[4:11:32] <%KineticZen> "What Is Right" and "What Is Left" make so much thematic sense as well as work as attack tells, so great
[4:11:54] <MrGuy516> this song is dope. is it new to endwalker or has it been in FFXIV for a while?
[4:12:00] <%UvBenServed> GOOD
[4:12:02] <tigerfang86> your twinkish knees
[4:12:04] <Warbot40> What's with this apocalypse and crazy mouths
[4:12:08] <+MoonObscure> xD
[4:12:14] <+Kyma1020> Twonk
[4:12:15] <Treasure_Vault> Go widdershins
[4:12:19] <DarkCloud79> New mid boss theme
[4:12:20] <smward87> new. every expansion adds like 100-200 new tracks @MrGuy516
[4:12:22] <DynzelWashington> Palaka stuff is great.
[4:12:30] <%UvBenServed> :)
[4:12:45] <+FinetiSonata> nope I saw that
[4:12:47] <Warbot40> I wish they were proper trials to some degree.
[4:12:58] <@QueequegTheater> I can't wait for Sephiroth to just be a FATE
[4:13:00] <MrGuy516> @smward87 thanks! hopefully the soundtrack for endwalker comes to spotify
[4:13:01] <MKII> trial anima would have been sweet
[4:13:14] <%Nekros4442> Sage actually has alot of regen
[4:13:14] <MKII> maybe one day they'll dip into dungeon bosses for Ultimate ideas
[4:13:14] <%InternetShis> Those jumpers will never find the Eels
[4:13:20] <tanarath> Zangief need food badly
[4:13:22] <Profmcstevie> He wants information
[4:13:32] <smward87> of course. in 2 or 3 separate releases because there's just that many songs lol @MrGuy516
[4:13:38] <%skizzuto> He hungers for knowledge
[4:13:38] <%InternetShis> psaDogchamp I see everything
[4:13:40] <Warbot40> I'm bummed Anima is just a dungeon boss
[4:13:43] <+robotman37> Damn it's hot in here
[4:13:44] <%DashXero> Lagomorph
[4:13:44] <MKII> hungry for woooords
[4:13:58] <%cobalt_phoenix_> aw man...
[4:14:08] <%InternetShis> You know what I like more than this artificial moon? KNAWLEDGE
[4:14:14] <Edible_Enthusiasm> turn them baaaack
[4:14:18] <%JoshManVGH> It's the final boss of everything, really.
[4:14:21] <%Birdigalore> Just smile forever and we'll be fine!
[4:14:21] <%Divryne> Junko Enoshima really was the final boss of FFXIV.
[4:14:30] <%MrP33Ps> this xpack is the epitome of "feels bad man"
[4:14:32] <%VictorVonLouche> Writers shacklers unchained for this expansion.
[4:14:52] <tanarath> BORK
[4:14:53] <jubejube56> Suddenly the loporrits being the way they are makes a lot more sense
[4:15:05] <dsarhana> is the solution to this just going to be the bus meme
[4:15:06] <%InternetShis> But would it pass in China is the real question?
[4:15:07] <%UvBenServed> You know what? Fuck this shit. Let's just go back to chillin with the adorable moon bunnies
[4:15:18] <Xenodile> Natsuko Ishikawa writing Endwalker like "I have such sights to show you."
[4:15:24] <Profmcstevie> Gotta look nice for the end days
[4:15:24] <%InternetShis> How much does the Chinese version of XIV change?
[4:15:26] <MsYakumo> Who'd have though the end of days would be dark as fuck
[4:15:30] <rosemon5001> isnt this just a thanos style plot? like swap the slate clean and shit?
[4:15:38] <%InternetShis> China says no femboys so how will they change Viera?
[4:15:47] <smward87> that would be Natsuko Ishikawa. and her entire resume is XIV. she has no professional writing credits prior. one hell of a start to a career @VictorVonLouche
[4:15:47] <+fetrigon> wait these are ff12 monsters
[4:15:50] <%KineticZen> Thanos was half of everything
[4:15:50] <+fetrigon> wat
[4:15:55] <%KineticZen> This is just everything
[4:16:11] <Warbot40> how the hell are we gonna undo this.
[4:16:20] <tanarath> @rosemon5001 If you did thanos well, with Zenos wanting to return everything to nothingness, sure.
[4:16:29] <dsarhana> @Warbot40 Not sure thats possible, more outlast
[4:16:36] <Profmcstevie> 7.0 A Realm Rebornestest
[4:16:51] <%blaccbird914> oh thats horrible to look at
[4:17:04] <+GalaxyUni> @rosemon5001 not really, thanos just want to kill half of life to recorrect order not to die and take everyone with him
[4:17:06] <%Dakuu75> OMFG
[4:17:08] <%Deft_Thought> eWW
[4:17:12] <%Deft_Thought> I don't like that

[4:17:48] <%Axellogic> Its still weird we havent fought Zenos yet
[4:17:49] <%ElkRiverDog> Welp, now we know why this is expansion is called EW
[4:18:04] <%KineticZen> Great creature designs
[4:18:06] <+Citizen_Cryo> So is that red spiral indicator for tankbusters? I've been trating them like they are
[4:18:06] <TurtlesAndTentacles> So that was an elephant person....damn
[4:18:07] <dsarhana> @dsarhana Huh I suppose your right
[4:18:14] <%cobalt_phoenix_> oh god how did i not see that before
[4:18:21] <%KineticZen> Approaching Giger levels
[4:18:22] <%Birdigalore> Oh my god I just noticed it's an elephant head EW
[4:18:36] <+robotman37> Nah let keep this place on fire
[4:18:40] <+Kyma1020> ;_;
[4:18:46] <MsYakumo> Yeeep. These used to be people.
[4:18:52] <%Birdigalore> This is some The Thing shit
[4:18:55] <%zyberion626> @birdigalore ah so that's why they called it Endwalker
[4:18:56] <+Kyma1020> You're right it is an elephant head
[4:18:59] <+FackuIkari> oh wow I didn't noticed the elephant, that's horrible
[4:18:59] <%balkonas1> The music slaps so hard
[4:19:00] <Admiral_PopnFresh> this thing looks like the back of an elephant's scull
[4:19:01] <MsYakumo> Welcome to the final days.
[4:19:16] <%cobalt_phoenix_> gotta wiggle around
[4:19:23] <TrollKing96> Where does the Terminus part of their name come from?
[4:19:29] <Admiral_PopnFresh> Giefy! Sick 'em!
[4:19:34] <+FinetiSonata> just be faster
[4:19:44] <+MoonObscure> they have little chainsaws
[4:19:45] <+Kyma1020> Basically meaning the End
[4:19:45] <Xenodile> "terminus" means end or final
[4:19:46] <+MoonObscure> the gloves
[4:19:57] <+fetrigon> @birdigalore I KNEW THE ELEPHANTS WERE THE ENDWALKER KomodoHype
[4:20:01] <sirrice77> @TrollKing96 they are monsters created in the final days, so it indicates they are the "end"
[4:20:01] <+fetrigon> KomodoHype KomodoHype KomodoHype
[4:20:08] <%cobalt_phoenix_> YEA
[4:20:09] <%UvBenServed> Yup
[4:20:11] <Admiral_PopnFresh> oh wow, look, it's California
[4:20:14] <Daxalog> The FF7 remake ghosts!
[4:20:19] <+acridpaladin> looks pretty normal to ff7 standards
[4:20:19] <dsarhana> OH
[4:20:19] <DarkCloud79> That's a lot of 2D sprites
[4:20:23] <dsarhana> THIS IS EVEN WORSE
[4:20:25] <+fetrigon> oh yeah that's zetta fucked
[4:20:31] <+Kyma1020> One of the moments a game actually made me feel primordial dread
[4:20:32] <%KineticZen> They are also harbingers of the end
[4:20:35] <%bundle_of_herbs> yo the terminus streamer

[4:24:00] <%ClericOfSparda> I thought he had the snip snip? They do that even after?
[4:24:04] <AllenDeadman> we could see it
[4:24:10] <AngryAsian5> Nice to see Gief approves of Endwalker LUL
[4:24:12] <%bundle_of_herbs> oh neat the asura of solar eclipses
[4:24:20] <TurtlesAndTentacles> Was...that..a person?
[4:24:20] <+MikeTD81> LET GIEF JERK IT
[4:24:20] <+Kyma1020> So I'm looking it up. Svarbhanu is an asura representing an eclipse
[4:24:23] <Profmcstevie> Squares Enix
[4:24:23] <SaltyAzteca> this enix of squares!!
[4:24:27] <%Birdigalore> All these circles make a square
[4:24:29] <Zebroneath> A whole 16 of them
[4:24:34] <arkv01> psaDogchamp the couch is very soft and wet
[4:24:36] <DreamCancel01> Tryna syke pat out huh
[4:24:42] <%InternetShis> 4x4 Enix
[4:24:43] <%UvBenServed> psaDab
[4:24:53] <%YakumoYomi> LUL
[4:25:02] <Admiral_PopnFresh> surprising Pat likes squares considering how round he is
[4:25:03] <SaltyAzteca> ph I see it
[4:25:12] <+Krivvan> oh I just noticed it's shapes for colorblind people too
[4:25:14] <+Kyma1020> Is that a buster marker?
[4:25:22] <MsYakumo> This thing is a great big pile of NOPE.
[4:25:32] <wolverinewaswrong> huh kinda looks like evrae
[4:25:39] <%shurtal> Welp, the final 23 percent of this dungeon's boss can be done with a warrior and one sam, cause i just did that
[4:25:48] <SinisterBroccoli> This reminds me of the first boss of Amurot
[4:25:58] <+MikeTD81> I will not be surprised if they introduce a rhythm mechanic soon
[4:26:00] <+Kyma1020> Near the end. Just flying
[4:26:37] <+Kyma1020> Before Bellwether got it
[4:26:38] <%zyberion626> @miketd81 that'd be a nightmare with latency though
[4:26:41] <+fetrigon> so are positionals gone for the most part?
[4:26:55] <xeros720> waiting for the fight where they force you to chocobo race and play the 1.0 crafting minigames
[4:26:56] <dan_g_v> so how would you rate your apocalypses?
[4:26:58] <dsarhana> @MikeTD81 The final boss is a rhythm game in the style of patapon
[4:27:05] <Xenodile> there are a few left, but they only affect potency, not mechanics
[4:27:16] <Xenodile> So DRGs don't have to do them for Raiden Thrust
[4:27:24] <Xenodile> but CAN do them for a little extra damage
[4:27:28] <moonbearbacon> why does the music sound a little distorted? is that international?
[4:27:28] <smward87> they're gone from first and second parts of combos. they are only on enders now for extra potency @fetrigon
[4:27:43] <+FinetiSonata> I like the gear from here
[4:28:01] <$Cthulos> @moonbearbacon refresh
[4:28:04] <+fetrigon> @xenodile @smward87 ah ok

[4:29:17] <Profmcstevie> and thank YOU zangief for your contributions
[4:29:21] <sirrice77> @StephanieSadGirl the final days started in Not India and a bunch of it's people transformed into monsters
[4:29:24] <Edible_Enthusiasm> what the heck was that
[4:29:26] <%StephanieSadGirl> I see, makes sense cause that thing is terrifying
[4:29:38] <%DashXero> He put all his money in crypto....
[4:29:39] <dsarhana> @StephanieSadGirl Someone pressed the off button on a tower and THIS immediately happened
[4:29:40] <Edible_Enthusiasm> is it like a sineatter?
[4:29:43] <%DashXero> And became ruined.

[4:30:25] <jorniev> so this is worse than sundered
[4:30:30] <%Reilata> Lack of magic = despair monsters?
[4:30:35] <jorniev> DEATH without rebirth
[4:30:36] <@QueequegTheater> @TurtlesAndTentacles The transformation eradicates your soul
[4:30:39] <moonbearbacon> hmm, it didnt seem to fix it but i'll keep checking

Yet, the Arcana is the means by which all is revealed... Beyond the beaten path lies the absolute end. It matters not who you are... Death awaits you.
