[0:37:26] <RyuuAoi> THE OG
[0:37:26] <SilverFaustX> why get a dog when u never leave the house?
[0:37:28] <ShichiNoBushi> I'd expect Elmo to eat the dog, but he's Elmo, and that wouldn't ever be feasible.

[0:37:30] <Halospaz117> If Elmo is Peepee, is Zangief Poopoo?

[0:38:15] <%PettyFunk> Cats are super territorial, their entire understanding of the world is pretty much based on what belongs to them
[0:38:16] <%DesertPenguin> Some of that pee you find might be Elmo and not Zangief
[0:38:17] <ShichiNoBushi> Also them rubbing on you is them claiming you as theirs.

[1:28:11] <+NitronStreams> nope
[1:28:13] <Pookiedaexzile> I've seen into the eyes of a pupper who has lost his faith in the system
[1:28:15] <Oncamimus> When they are puppies its a good idea to "mess with them", what i mean is squish their paws, stick your fingers in their ears mouth and nose...pet them against the grain etc....this prepares them for vet visits and people who are too stupid to know how to pet dogs correctly so that they dont snap and end up biting someone or become absolutely difficult to deal with monsters. It sounds mean...but it really helps as they get older.
[1:28:15] <%GarbageNirvana> i want

[2:18:43] <Di0_brando> acab time indeed
[2:18:46] <dafreakboi> @QueequegTheater I don't know, however I do believe making the therapist angry will lead to the "kill option being decided. Still up to chance.
[2:18:47] <%penitentpentwitch> Considering the current political climate, this cop killing is... uh...
[2:18:49] <+MarshallLee67> can't parry shotguns LUL
[2:18:49] <Vashido22> I see Pat is doing it the coward way
[2:18:52] <mattdel92> Was everyone at the previous jobs already dead?
[2:18:54] <%Buzzard42> of course he's doing it this way, the game literally trains you to do it this way
[2:18:54] <heartlesshealer> princess beach time
[2:18:59] <Di0_brando> @saltyazteca you can do either
[2:18:59] <Matoryis> yeah pats really doing a mgs5 isnt he

[2:19:02] <+Chester_goes_Berserk> you can beat this pacifist but big hard
[2:19:05] <nutimik> can't reflect shotgun bullets. Unless...
[2:19:06] <snakemuho> you take drug you stealth, you refuse drug you kill

[2:19:15] <%AncelDeLambert> Woolie balls EXPOSED
[2:19:18] <$QueequegTheater> @dafreakboi No, pissing off the therapist to the extreme is how you get the superboss
[2:19:20] <dafreakboi> Man, @skizzuto , [REDACTED] is such a fun character. I love his ability to [REDACTED], super fun.
[2:19:22] <Di0_brando> @razielhex +1

[2:20:20] <%Valdorick> RACE WAR!
[2:20:21] <dafreakboi> @QueequegTheater I understand that. But i'm saying if you're typically being rude, but not full out pissing off the therapist, the chance of a "KILL" contract appearing increases. Get what I'm saying?
[2:20:23] <%cvp5127> yea racism
[2:20:23] <%isa_sensei96> don't kill the Bum.

[2:52:19] <%skizzuto> wow the little girl was fucking impaled there

[2:52:48] <feet_hands> @chiazamformerlymankeyfigh it really feels like it has so much potential for a sequel or spinoff

[2:53:20] <heartlesshealer> depends on how much you're able to take in from your current path
[2:53:21] <%unremarkableprodigy> Nope
[2:53:21] <stayinthepocket> Nah you'll piece it together mostly
[2:53:22] <+FriendWarbo> @CommanderSqueaks The drug lets his cheat time, but without it he freezes in it, or perceives it that way
[2:53:24] <RichochetForce> The trailer track!
[2:53:24] <Di0_brando> it comes together at the end

[2:53:36] <%dks_junkie> ok i just bought this game, ive avoided it for long enough
[2:53:36] <dafreakboi> @PatStaresAt I've played the game fully and done some discussions. It'll make more sense at the end but I can give you some answers as to why somethings happen.
[2:53:37] <+redjack108> It explains itself, mostly
[2:53:38] <+bugz_munny> Theres a secret cool thing you can watch on youtube thats a BIG SPOILER
[2:53:38] <+NitronStreams> is this like a video game version of the ending to big o
[2:53:47] <AoiRob> all gets explained
[2:53:50] <dafreakboi> LUL
[2:53:52] <%dks_junkie> C yall, im out to play this wild shit
[2:53:53] <Man_in_the_Red> huh, i actually forgot this game had slo mo
[2:53:53] <Di0_brando> @friendwarbo correct so withdrawl is essentially being trapped in time alone
[2:53:56] <jase__x> Absolutely not you are given all the information you need
[2:54:03] <Man_in_the_Red> i used it like twice i think
[2:54:04] <devilmanjay> @chat so in a fight between ruiner and this guy who would win?
[2:54:04] <+redjack108> And the gameplay is all good so I’d suggest getting to the end
[2:54:06] <nutimik> has he not unlocked any other swords yet?
[2:54:06] <masterkazzugos> @IminyourBase But, is not Pat gross, too? Is the gross not essential to the joy that is the PatStaresAt Stream?
[2:54:10] <feet_hands> remember you can move with swings! @PatStaresAt
[2:54:10] <Wakerpl> @dks_junkie good choice
[2:54:10] <Man_in_the_Red> and both was in the minecart

[2:54:49] <SomeAsianDood> meat grinder is still my favorite song but this is close
[2:54:53] <Wakerpl> @nutimik swords are hard to get on your first playthrough, no?

[2:56:48] <masterkazzugos> What does Zangief offer to the stream? Perhaps he offers love, but does he demand attention? Does Steve Buscemi look upon him with the same reference as Elmo, the main attraction? Maybe he offers something.... more?

[3:35:02] <%InugamiTheHound> dekuHYPE
[3:35:04] <TheFilth> ugh ughhhhh
[3:35:07] <%CommanderSqueaks> Is there any reason to not just dart for the exit every time?
[3:35:20] <+MarshallLee67> you can't lol you have to kill everyone @CommanderSqueaks
[3:35:21] <%goose_attack_almanac> Style?
[3:35:21] <heartlesshealer> Yeah, need your periphery vision on this one
[3:35:23] <+bugz_munny> you have to kill everyone
[3:35:23] <+xeros720> have to kill everyone, usually
[3:35:24] <Wakerpl> you can't
[3:35:25] <nutimik> they can use doorways, pat
[3:35:25] <Di0_brando> gotta kill all enemies
[3:35:26] <+2hutown> This was such a fun game to master
[3:35:26] <+the22cstomp> you have to kill all enemies
[3:35:27] <$QueequegTheater> @CommanderSqueaks Gotta clear the room
[3:35:28] <%tonfirean> I think the exit isn't open until you kill everyone
[3:35:30] <RichochetForce> @CommanderSqueaks Exit only opens when they're dead
[3:35:30] <Stphor> omg pat looks like max payne 3
[3:35:31] <+razielhex> @CommanderSqueaks You aren't allowed to exit until the enemy's are down
[3:35:31] <%CommanderSqueaks> @MarshallLee67 Oh okay, wasn't sure.
[3:35:34] <SomeAsianDood> @commandersqueaks it's like a beat em ip
[3:35:40] <dabeaminator> Zangief is a great name for a big dog, omg
[3:35:41] <%AzureGale> You have to KILL EVERY LAST ONE OF THEM
[3:35:41] <Man_in_the_Red> because just gunning it for the exit nulifies the gameplay loop
[3:35:41] <dafreakboi> SourPls
[3:35:46] <+the22cstomp> you opened the door pat
[3:35:46] <heartlesshealer> you already broke the door

[3:36:06] <Man_in_the_Red> yes
[3:36:08] <heartlesshealer> good job
[3:36:09] <%PettyFunk> Nice!
[3:36:10] <%Valdorick> First try!
[3:36:13] <Di0_brando> careful of doors
[3:36:14] <$QueequegTheater> @CursedNobleman Yes

[3:36:26] <BackwardCap> Who is this guy and where did Pat go?
[3:36:27] <%doc_ock_rokc> pat almost had chronos withdraw
[3:36:31] <Vashido22> NO PAT
[3:36:31] <+the22cstomp> not using timeslow makes rooms a lot faster if you know how to route them
[3:36:33] <SomeAsianDood> and duck game is also a machine
[3:36:34] <Vashido22> THE DIALOGUE
[3:36:34] <stayinthepocket> That Duck Game cabinet
[3:36:39] <%CommanderSqueaks> So he isn't wearing a Kimono, he's literally wearing a bathrobe?
[3:36:41] <RichochetForce> @BackwardCap This guy consumed Pat.
[3:36:42] <%doc_ock_rokc> ITS COSPLAY YOU BASARDS
[3:36:44] <jorniev> this game makes me sweat some times

[3:38:59] <nutimik> they aren't alive
[3:39:01] <Man_in_the_Red> the drones are basically moving grenades
[3:39:05] <KaiGoesMoo> It's been a while since I played this, I forgot how satisfying this game feels when you do well
[3:39:06] <+MarshallLee67> it tells you "GO" once all humans are dead
[3:39:09] <+redjack108> He’s beginning to believe
[3:39:13] <tattleworm> the rule is leave no witnesses but drones aren't snitches

[3:39:49] <+Noxyba> 410 billion dead cops
[3:39:49] <Louie_Salmon> Well what's the logic for having to kill enemies before you can continue? If it's so they can't follow you, why wouldn't that also apply to a drone?
[3:39:51] <%AzureGale> Can't stop, just go
[3:39:52] <%Buzzard42> and by hours I mean it took forever
[3:39:54] <RichochetForce> Tearing through dudes

[3:40:09] <RichochetForce> @Louie_Salmon Therapist wants no witnesses
[3:40:13] <%CommanderSqueaks> @Louie_Salmon You just need to eliminate witnesses.
[3:40:13] <$QueequegTheater> How many times will Pat attempt to use the elevator doors before he remembers he can't use them
[3:40:14] <%clockworknate> Highlight my message! .... it worked!
[3:40:18] <Di0_brando> ^
[3:40:19] <SomeAsianDood> @louie_salmon no witnesses apparently drones don't record
[3:40:20] <%PettyFunk> Pat is doing great, he's honestly flying through these stages, most of these took me ages
[3:40:22] <%skizzuto> @Louie_Salmon leave no witnesses, I think
[3:40:32] <RichochetForce> Pat is going insane
[3:40:34] <%chiazamformerlymankeyfigh> Whoops

[3:43:42] <%DesertPenguin> NEXT BIT
[3:43:46] <%AncelDeLambert> yeah, english IS hard when the english is COLOR CODED AND THE COLORS KEEP SWITCHING
[3:43:47] <%CommanderSqueaks> Watch Pat fast forward through these choices and accidentally pick Death again.
[3:43:47] <Di0_brando> he just wanted to show us all the content guys
[3:43:48] <Man_in_the_Red> shame they couldnt let you fight it out and you go the life path anyways
[3:43:52] <jorniev> Lucky
[3:44:04] <RichochetForce> @Man_in_the_Red Like the end of RDR1
[3:44:10] <heartlesshealer> Next time you hit the menu, check those prison tapes when you can. It was the one level where the footage was all static
[3:44:12] <%DesertPenguin> NG+?
[3:44:13] <nutimik> yeah I do wish the "death" choice was a little more interesting
[3:44:17] <+Mitchellsocks> I"m having flashbacks to getting my first END in 999
[3:44:32] <%clockworknate> so is this because you didnt drug it up?
[3:44:33] <Man_in_the_Red> i mean, RDR1 has the hard cap with the lock on shots
[3:44:34] <Di0_brando> i don't blame pat for picking death i thought I could 5HEAD this choice too
[3:44:35] <+rottingpastry> Actually if cops are going to live because of this choice, yeah, live
[3:44:36] <+MarshallLee67> acab
[3:44:45] <dabeaminator> SURELY

[3:44:58] <%MelBrooksKA> One cup of live please
[3:45:00] <%CommanderSqueaks> @nutimik Considering that V told him that he'd soon be stuck in a living hell of never being able to die, being able to just die would be a very appealing choice.
[3:45:00] <%PettyFunk> That doesn't just mean targets
[3:45:11] <$QueequegTheater> All ends are bad ends
[3:45:13] <Di0_brando> @commandersqueaks exactly

[3:51:26] <heartlesshealer> Actual flash steps
[3:51:27] <%Buzzard42> it's not a flashstep
[3:51:28] <%Buzzard42> it's INSTANT

[3:51:34] <Wakerpl> THE DRAGON DUDE
[3:51:34] <RichochetForce> It looks like he's teleporting
[3:51:38] <heartlesshealer> well, it's something
[3:51:38] <%CommanderSqueaks> Instant Transmission
[3:51:38] <RichochetForce> Because he is

[3:51:49] <+bugz_munny> THUNDERCLAP AND FLASH
[3:51:54] <Wakerpl> he's so fucking fast
[3:51:54] <jorniev> JUST LIKE WESKER
[3:51:55] <%Aztec50> but he still moves though
[3:51:58] <Di0_brando> i think this room would be impossible with normal protag kun
[3:51:59] <LorcaNomad> SourPls
[3:52:02] <%ringabal> So this is the power of the Zapping System
[3:52:05] <%TalisKanju> They have a dog now? Nice
[3:52:05] <%Buzzard42> rekt
[3:52:06] <$RealThiele> big drug power
[3:52:09] <%Valdorick> Get bodied
[3:52:10] <%AncelDeLambert> this music is actively hurting my ears
[3:52:12] <%AncelDeLambert> what the fuck
[3:52:16] <+MarshallLee67> THIS FUCKING SONG
[3:52:17] <extradopeness> Oh most definitely @di0_brando
[3:52:20] <%Buzzard42> @Di0_brando you don't need the flashstep here
[3:52:21] <CursedNobleman> @jorniev RIP DC Douglass
[3:52:21] <%DappercatEsquire> doing a 'you but better' is always neat
[3:52:24] <RichochetForce> Remember guys, Chronos = The Good Shit
[3:52:30] <dafreakboi> This song is easily my favorite
[3:52:39] <SomeAsianDood> breath of the serpent is such a good track
[3:52:44] <nutimik> Dragon swings slower
[3:52:44] <SomeAsianDood> such a good name too
[3:52:46] <%GarbageNirvana> Turns out guns have more than one bullet in em, who knew
[3:52:48] <+CharredChord> a second bullet? who would have known?
[3:52:54] <%themichinator> themichinator subscribed with Twitch Prime. 
[3:52:54] <%PettyFunk> This is actual Za Warudo, your character just speeds up his senses and reactions, but this guy actually slows time
[3:52:59] <Vashido22> good job pat
[3:53:00] <Saltmeisterr> wait what happened to DC Douglas?
[3:53:05] <RichochetForce> @SomeAsianDood Aye, I played that in my car and people actually came up and asked me the damn song name
[3:53:06] <extradopeness> This music is really good if you aren’t slowing the time down constantly
[3:53:07] <%Monkeyweed21> wow pat is really bad
[3:53:08] <dafreakboi> Also this level gives no shit. It's absolute hell
[3:53:08] <RichochetForce> It's that good
[3:53:09] <heartlesshealer> It was flashing, so something was in the way
[3:53:10] <Di0_brando> rip
[3:53:14] <mikalwoods> i would say you will never know is my favorite
[3:53:21] <NeroInfinite> drugs are a helluva thing
[3:53:23] <$RealThiele> remember kids, dont do drugs unless it gives you time powers
[3:53:27] <shotgang86> kinda making me wanting to play it again
[3:53:28] <Vashido22> SICK
[3:53:32] <RichochetForce> @mikalwoods That's actually another strong one
[3:53:33] <CursedNobleman> "If we go on, you're hamburger!"
[3:53:33] <heartlesshealer> always confirm blue line before letting go
[3:53:34] <%PettyFunk> This music kinda reminds me of Nidhogg (1)
[3:53:35] <%ringabal> YO OKAY
[3:53:35] <Vashido22> not sick anymore
[3:53:39] <dabeaminator> Eggpat is horrible, I will see him in my restless dreams
[3:53:44] <%Buzzard42> I'm definitely doing a fresh playthrough now
[3:53:52] <%ringabal> BECOME THE DRAG ON
[3:53:52] <Di0_brando> oh im 100% playing it again without timestop after the stream
[3:53:55] <extradopeness> The nature of the game kinda ruins the music but that’s what Spotify is for lmao
[3:54:00] <Vashido22> speedrunning this game is super fun
[3:54:09] <CursedNobleman> LUL
[3:54:17] <+radpuffin> this level right here made me quit the game goodluck pat
[3:54:19] <Digsby> I wonder if the sword is what lets him dash, not the drug.
[3:54:24] <kulmoth> just use your thing bro
[3:54:24] <jorniev> the fact that he can do it in the air makes this guy SO BUSTED
[3:54:26] <dafreakboi> People can speedrun this game in 20 minutes
[3:54:36] <dafreakboi> Also Hard Mode is super rage-inducing.
[3:54:37] <%Valdorick> Maybe don't go through that path?
[3:54:38] <%Typhaeon> Way to sell the whole "unstoppable badass" routine
[3:54:40] <%Buzzard42> yeah this guy can triangle jump and that's fuckin wild
[3:54:40] <%DappercatEsquire> you do need to hit the button
[3:54:42] <nutimik> jesus pat
[3:54:52] <%Monkeyweed21> maybe dont facefuck the bullets @PatStaresAt
[3:54:52] <+MarshallLee67> hard mode took me four and a half hours lmao
[3:54:53] <Di0_brando> its 100% the drug not the sword
[3:54:54] <+MarshallLee67> it's nuts
[3:54:58] <Vashido22> PAT
[3:54:58] <TheFilth> this game gets you caught up in the cool shit, only to die in the lamest way
[3:55:10] <nutimik> maybe take a different route?
[3:55:12] <RichochetForce> Haha
[3:55:12] <extradopeness> I definitely need to run thru this game again
[3:55:17] <ShinobiPhoenix> normal protag can already triangle jump
[3:55:19] <+MarshallLee67> LULL
[3:55:20] <nutimik> instead of doing the same thing over and over
[3:55:22] <%doc_ock_rokc> is it face fucking or fuck facing?
[3:55:23] <%SleepyMaribo> is this game good?
[3:55:24] <$RealThiele> dont face fuck a xenomorph
[3:55:24] <LorcaNomad> there's more than one way up there pat try the middle floor
[3:55:30] <%SleepyMaribo> seems kinda frustrating
[3:55:37] <Di0_brando> @sleepymaribo incredible yes
[3:55:38] <rpnm991> Sounds kinky
[3:55:38] <nutimik> @SleepyMaribo really good! but kind of short
[3:55:42] <Digsby> Can't protag unlock swords with cool shit attached to them though?
[3:55:46] <stayinthepocket> Lol relax Pat
[3:55:49] <+MarshallLee67> this game cums @SleepyMaribo
[3:55:49] <dabeaminator> This has huge Superhot energy
[3:55:49] <shotgang86> Pat, take your time, this one is really hard
[3:55:50] <nutimik> yes
[3:55:51] <Wakerpl> @digsby well, the drug allows him to see the future, the dashing is his own skill
[3:55:52] <%doc_ock_rokc> @PatStaresAt Are you suffering from Chronos Withdraw?
[3:55:53] <extradopeness> Fuck the faces pat. Fuck em all.
[3:55:56] <nutimik> but pat has found no weapons yet
[3:55:59] <RichochetForce> Super. HOT.
[3:56:05] <Valdorick> First shot
[3:56:05] <%PettyFunk> Well done
[3:56:13] <LorcaNomad> pog
[3:56:15] <+MarshallLee67> nice
[3:56:23] <Di0_brando> @shotgang86 ye its like the second hardest are after the bunker elevators. that area don't fuck around
[3:56:24] <%AncelDeLambert> this music seriously is hurting my ears, the hell
[3:56:28] <%chiazamformerlymankeyfigh> No it's not
[3:56:30] <%maenos2> this music gets a bit grating on the ears
[3:56:30] <RichochetForce> Yeah, these cops were doomed
[3:56:32] <%Monkeyweed21> its unbeatable if they're not you
[3:56:40] <nutimik> you have baby ears then
[3:56:43] <+radpuffin> holy shit noice
[3:56:47] <%clockworknate> i dont understand, whats the deal with replays?
[3:56:50] <extradopeness> @anceldelambert you listening with headphones?
[3:57:03] <Di0_brando> how is this music hurting your ears?
[3:57:04] <%AncelDeLambert> no, I'm not, which is why it's so nuts
[3:57:08] <dafreakboi> @clockworknate they replay the attempt without slow mode
[3:57:09] <+MarshallLee67> the music in this game does such a good job at ramping up and putting you in the mindset of a drug-fueld murder spree
[3:57:10] <extradopeness> You know there is a volume control right? Lmao
[3:57:14] <Di0_brando> maybe you have an ear infection
[3:57:30] <%AncelDeLambert> high pitched whining is surprising to you all with its ability to harm ears?
[3:57:32] <Hydrapissed> ada wait
[3:57:32] <$QueequegTheater> ADA WAIT
[3:57:35] <Ell1ot> Leeeeon!
