[0:21:09] <TrollKing96> @PatStaresAt I think most of the design changes are because FromSoft and Bluepoint have very different design philosophies.

[0:52:22] <Meta_Outhorii> He just casually brushes off the arm
[0:52:23] <cipher758> there's this constant feeling of dread
[0:52:23] <%Konquerer> this is horrific
[0:52:24] <gryffinp> Yeah that was my number one question too pat
[0:52:24] <justachap> This is my fetish
[0:52:25] <%Dementedpenguin> This is already more gross than watching The Fly
[0:52:25] <+fingalights> This is some Eldritch horror stuff
[0:52:27] <%boomstickery> must wear off
[0:52:27] <Maleicus> true
[0:52:27] <+FleshFriend> I think it wears off probably
[0:52:28] <+Dives__> Temporary
[0:52:28] <%YakumoYomi> Maybe it's temporary?
[0:52:29] <OverzealousEuthanasiast> Doctor? Please?
[0:52:30] <+Dimfish> exactly!
[0:52:30] <+AXL808> no blood, only strawberry
[0:52:30] <TopTierHarley> it's not the first
[0:52:30] <SaltyAzteca> @PatStaresAt He never caught any
[0:52:30] <studleydoorite> no questions, only bugsnax
[0:52:31] <ChrisFailsAt> he couldnt catch them
[0:52:32] <reonome> its probably temporary
[0:52:32] <Daxalog> Maybe he goes back to normal over time
[0:52:32] <ECRead> SHUT UP. BUGSNAX.
[0:52:33] <pienapped4real> Cannibalism
[0:52:33] <hat_under_bread> It probably wears off over time.
[0:52:34] <%honeyman18> ATE ASSS
[0:52:34] <Coconosuga> shhhhhhhhhh
[0:52:35] <%tonfirean> Man, this music is tense.
[0:52:35] <+Stormzcales_Lair> he is scrub can't catch any
[0:52:36] <peachy996> Why is this idiot the Mayor?
[0:52:36] <AnacondaVirtue> Maybe it wears off after a while?
[0:52:36] <ThorgrimFunhammer> it's drugs
[0:52:37] <bbblaketwitching> I guess they just have to reset it somehow...
[0:52:37] <ShichiNoBushi> Temporary?
[0:52:37] <jorniev> temporary effect?
[0:52:38] <TopTierHarley> fiending
[0:52:38] <CosmicApe13> maybe bug snax wears off
[0:52:39] <%caramelatte1> cannibalisms
[0:52:39] <+thegreenbenis> Temporary
[0:52:40] <+Delenay> maybe he wears off when you shit it out
[0:52:40] <%Starotter70> Like a drug!?
[0:52:41] <rcand9> he was jonesing
[0:52:41] <+mikesapartment> is this a junji ito short
[0:52:42] <+AXL808> maybe it's temporary
[0:52:42] <+gitgouda> cracksnax
[0:52:43] <munitalprats> CANNIBALISM
[0:52:44] <EASrake> Drug allegory
[0:52:44] <%Pookiedaexzile> Its Temporary?
[0:52:45] <@PlagueOfGripes> SnaxEdging
[0:52:45] <@SoFarFetched> I could see taht
[0:52:46] <dabeaminator> It's probably temporary
[0:52:47] <%crimsonharvest> he was coming down?
[0:52:48] <+zamatermort> Maybe it wears off man
[0:52:48] <%VioletHeart> Or he ate a person and it turned him back.
[0:52:50] <%TrafficCohen> Bugsnax are heroin
[0:52:50] <Oxybe> it's cocaine. bugsnax is cocaine
[0:52:50] <%s1rcuit> I like Paige's hypothesis
[0:52:50] <randomahole> is this bioshock 4?
[0:52:51] <+Piejumper5814> based off the trailer is that it wears off eventually
[0:52:51] <Baeltyr> its heroin, the bugsnax are secretly heroin
[0:52:52] <AFlyingTaco1> Also, if you have the controller sound turned on, you can hear the bugsnax saying their name before they get eaten
[0:52:53] <ThorgrimFunhammer> DRUGSNAX
[0:52:54] <borkmire> time limit on effect?
[0:52:54] <+other_badger> upsettingly long Kreygasm
[0:52:54] <+gitgouda> cracksnax is the game of the future
[0:52:54] <BlkFlameKami> DRUGSNAX
[0:52:55] <+fingalights> Upsettingly long
[0:52:55] <EASrake> UPSETTINGLY

[0:53:00] <+BlackSunEmperor> upsettingly long
[0:53:01] <iosephe> Upsettingly long tongue, hm
[0:53:01] <+skyheys> UPSETTINGLY
[0:53:02] <%YakumoYomi> I would love for this game to take a disturbing turn into addiction
[0:53:02] <Louie_Salmon> That's an unsettling detail to just throw out there
[0:53:03] <BeagleCypher> Green loli!? PogChamp
[0:53:03] <Spliffdonk> I think they self-cannibalize and regrow themselves
[0:53:04] <haitakaa> become as snacks
[0:53:04] <jerobees> UPSETTINGLY LONG TONGUE
[0:53:05] <AFlyingTaco1> You'll have to keep playing to find those answers Pat
[0:53:05] <%tonfirean> I'm glad this game acknowledges my emotions.

[0:53:13] <$8BitDsx> I should be working but this game is just..so interestingly strange.
[0:53:14] <the_super_suit> this is very upsetting
[0:53:15] <dabeaminator> Did Pat make a character?
[0:53:15] <Zebroneath> jesus
[0:53:16] <%ChestMimik> Mood
[0:53:16] <OkamiDude15> the real bugsnax was the addictions we got along the way

[0:55:08] <mrbigslaps> I can't tell if the emoji's are cute or icky
[0:55:08] <CosmicApe13> EAT THE WEAK
[0:55:10] <+aslfrasle> If Bugsnaxs eat people, do they get more human-like?
[0:55:11] <bbblaketwitching> this isnt horror, but boy if it isnt consistently horrifying
[0:55:12] <%cvp5127> NotLikeThis
[0:55:12] <%TigerCatGo> I CAN GET BEHIND THIS
[0:55:12] <%honeyman18> Eyes become plain unseeing potatoes burried deep in your sockets
[0:55:16] <heart_ablaze> the carrot looks like one of those fuzzy string worms you play with as a kid
[0:55:22] <Hanyusha> pat is so boring he literally goes for carrots in a fun snacks game
[0:55:23] <jorniev> DONT EAT IT
[0:55:24] <gryffinp> This feels like, rather than try to make a creepypasta game, they set out to make a game that creepypastas get written ABOUT ten years later
[0:55:25] <%DianaTheAscian> it talks?
[0:55:25] <+ALazo> Can't you turn it off? Some ps4 games also do that
[0:55:26] <Hanyusha> carrots are not snacks!
[0:55:28] <%boomstickery> youre doing this to conscious beings
[0:55:31] <%ChestMimik> Emphasise with your prey, Patrick
[0:55:31] <OkamiDude15> oh worm?
[0:55:33] <yourliteraldog> I like it
[0:55:33] <AFlyingTaco1> This game is actually adorable, it just takes some getting used to
[0:55:35] <cardamomo88> mmm delicius
[0:55:38] <%BagofLotions> its pokemon but its bugsnax
[0:55:40] <+michingmallecho> Playing through more of Astro playroom and the rain effect is giving me ideas of how resident evil is going to use this and other horror games and I’m already terrified
[0:55:41] <CosmicApe13> This game is pretty metal ngl
[0:55:42] <%boomstickery> they are begging for their lives
[0:55:42] <%FacetiousAF> worm off the string, what sins will he commit??
[0:55:43] <%SirKeigan> What is this game? Is it fun?
[0:55:53] <%HitchhikingThrough> oh god

[1:36:06] <dreamfillah> But if you eat enough you turn into a bugsnax???? maube???
[1:36:09] <+taltalheights> I dont want to imagine the depravity this guy sees on the regular

[1:37:27] <%Starotter70> Ah
[1:37:27] <%Mr_y1096> wait it has pull?
[1:37:28] <%Pookiedaexzile> Double Action Trigger on a Controller?
[1:37:29] <Slim_Lipid> That encodes well :)
[1:37:29] <B1ak3N1k05999> B I G P A T

[1:37:37] <+rickelstiltskin> adaptive trigger?
[1:37:41] <%Cozy90> WutFace no liek
[1:37:42] <Profmcstevie> Adaptive resistance?
[1:37:44] <%Mr_y1096> wierd
[1:37:44] <AFlyingTaco1> It becomes a gamecube R button
[1:37:45] <chancho4tierra> DOUBLE TRIGGER ACTION
[1:37:47] <+sermittens> @PatStaresAt This game is nightmare fuel
[1:37:47] <%doc_ock_rokc> oh neat
[1:37:48] <+taltalheights> Eat God become God
[1:37:48] <%boomstickery> ok thats weird
[1:37:48] <julrave> that's rad
[1:37:48] <$realm_forge> When does Big Pat Start?
[1:37:48] <+mlow44> There's a motor in the trigger
[1:37:50] <EASrake> That's fucking weird
[1:37:50] <%JetpackMcQuack> It adjusts itself
[1:37:52] <dabeaminator> That's super weird
[1:37:52] <dinnydanny777> Gamecube triggers LUL
[1:37:52] <%Starotter70> Neat
[1:37:53] <%BoxNavy> oh??????
[1:37:53] <nintega010> oh wow neat
[1:37:54] <lucky_icarus> Ugh, that seems awful
[1:37:54] <rcand9> thats awesome
[1:37:55] <%boomstickery> contextual trigger resistanc
[1:37:55] <%josstyl_0> THATS COOOL
[1:37:56] <%Mr_y1096> could be cool for a shooter
[1:37:56] <%BoxNavy> thats cool
[1:37:57] <%BrazenMask> dang
[1:37:58] <dinnydanny777> Is it Gamecube triggers hahaha
[1:37:58] <Blank9> these controllers are going to break so easily
[1:37:59] <+thegreenbenis> That's fucking weird
[1:37:59] <blackbookalpha> They slapped a motor on those triggers
[1:38:00] <+eiightbiitt> it's crazy feeling on the Astro bot game
[1:38:00] <+mlow44> The motor in the trigger applies variable resistance
[1:38:00] <Zerud> some sort of adaptable resistance?
[1:38:02] <sapphomet777> this gsme suck
[1:38:02] <+OwlLightningMage> There's no way that shit isn't going to break
[1:38:04] <SaltyAzteca> HUUUUGE
[1:38:05] <%BoxNavy> hi again
[1:38:05] <%toastybites> that sounds great for racing games
[1:38:05] <EndoMillsTV> reminds me of the xbox contollers version of this that they used for racing games
[1:38:05] <Slim_Lipid> But can i put it in a cardboard piano tho
[1:38:07] <+MeatBomb> Resistive trigger throw?
[1:38:08] <%TalisKanju> SPLOOSH
[1:38:09] <SuperBloodWolfMoon> There's no way that hardware will function for more than a year
[1:38:10] <bigshedman> Gamecuber triggers PogChamp
[1:38:10] <%AEUG_Ace_Kamille> Weird but cool.
[1:38:11] <JumbleJams> context sensitive trigger
[1:38:11] <+CookieCutter007> I wonder what slim feedback is like
[1:38:11] <%doc_ock_rokc> There is no big pat
[1:38:17] <%MechArch> psaBig
[1:38:18] <AFlyingTaco1> It offers different levels of resistance for various things
[1:38:18] <+mikesapartment> ohhhh
[1:38:20] <+mundanelotus> hopefully it wont be a one time gimmick
[1:38:21] <cosmicgoatee> wow
[1:38:22] <%doc_ock_rokc> only wide pat
[1:38:25] <OswaldTheDog> BIG!
[1:38:28] <SaltyAzteca> oh wow
[1:38:30] <dabeaminator> Coooool
[1:38:30] <studleydoorite> look how few people in chat realize how awesome that it
[1:38:31] <%Aarseth> Contextual resistance?
[1:38:32] <%doc_ock_rokc> neat
[1:38:33] <%BoxNavy> huh...
[1:38:34] <%JetpackMcQuack> Neat
[1:38:34] <+OwlLightningMage> That shit is going to break
[1:38:34] <%BigCoffee> we see a bit
[1:38:34] <%Mr_y1096> we can see
[1:38:36] <OperatorPlease> man this will be ignored in SO MANY GAMES
[1:38:37] <dabeaminator> We can see
[1:38:37] <%MrMegaJackpots> psaBig
[1:38:38] <heart_ablaze> interesting...
[1:38:38] <$realm_forge> ...l still don’t see big pat
[1:38:39] <Emelyns> oh dope
[1:38:39] <%arancet> so trigger resistance changes?
[1:38:39] <+Piejumper5814> thats neat but really weird
[1:38:39] <Dao_Puppy> This is going to break so fast...
[1:38:39] <nintega010> That's neat
[1:38:41] <spinningchurro> I get it. It uses baltic feedback to artificially add resistance to the trigger at any point the developers want to put it.
[1:38:42] <%JetpackMcQuack> Dynamic resistance
[1:38:42] <Tuna_Can_0> calebPog
[1:38:42] <AFlyingTaco1> You can definitely get a better feel for it in Astro's Playroom.
[1:38:43] <%Pookiedaexzile> How are tehy doing that
[1:38:45] <+solzan2000> oh I see
[1:38:45] <%MrMegaJackpots> psaBig psaWhat
[1:38:45] <jimmytwofeet> ENHANCE
[1:38:46] <%ChestMimik> That's nuts
[1:38:47] <%squidking96> squidking96 subscribed at Tier 1. They've subscribed for 20 months! hi bumbo
[1:38:47] <%boomstickery> if its electro magnetic there might not be any prats too break
[1:38:47] <%josstyl_0> so cool
[1:38:48] <rekinom> Interested to see a teardown video of that controller
[1:38:49] <Frampis> do you like the trigger stuff??
[1:38:49] <+korean_random> I sees it
[1:38:50] <rcand9> thats really cool tech
[1:38:53] <EASrake> The trigger adds resistance based on the action
[1:38:54] <%Pookiedaexzile> Who asked for this
[1:38:54] <bigshedman> Visualizing haptic feedback haha
[1:38:55] <%KineKithZen> Baltic feedback LuL
[1:38:56] <$dalmek> @PatStaresAt protip: you can now induce vomiting by cancelling after feeding a snack, but before choosing a limb
[1:38:59] <Tuna_Can_0> can we get an even bigger pat to help explain?
[1:39:00] <+It_sjustjoey> Huh. Weird.
[1:39:02] <justachap> These controllers are going to be $200 in Australian aren't they?
[1:39:02] <rcand9> thats next gen controlls
[1:39:04] <%doc_ock_rokc> @Pookiedaexzile my guess is a slider senser and a mild break
[1:39:04] <$Skittlesoul> so like is the trigger resisting the press?
[1:39:04] <huskarl_zap> Reject modernity, return to snax.
[1:39:05] <+solzan2000> I get it, cool feature
[1:39:05] <shruke> Actually cool
[1:39:06] <%SaiyanShoto> The controller is some next gen shit
[1:39:08] <%AEUG_Ace_Kamille> I hope devs do cool shit with that.
[1:39:08] <Hellarussian> so this is Sujimon?
[1:39:10] <cosmicgoatee> adaptive triggers are fucking kinda cool
[1:39:12] <%AzureGale> PRO TIT
[1:39:12] <mrbigslaps> @PatStaresAt how does the controller feel though
[1:39:14] <%BoxNavy> oh...
[1:39:14] <Old_tac0> lol
[1:39:15] <Louie_Salmon> What the fuck
[1:39:15] <%greasypete00> god

[1:39:21] <@SoFarFetched> D:
[1:39:21] <thelonechris> WHAT
[1:39:22] <shruke> I imagine it could be cool for QTEs
[1:39:22] <+OwlLightningMage> Gross WutFace
[1:39:23] <blackbookalpha> Google image search "Adaptive Trigger Motor", its bonkers
[1:39:23] <WholesomeSandwhichPeddler> Exceed in DMCV feels amazing
[1:39:24] <+ArmoredDeath> I M M E R S I O N
[1:39:24] <Slim_Lipid> @spinningchurro i.e. never in any 3rd party game 6 months after release LUL
[1:39:26] <Louie_Salmon> Why is this game like this
[1:39:26] <%toastybites> DI IT
[1:39:27] <whimsicallifestyle> ...yeah
[1:39:27] <%toastybites> DO IT
[1:39:27] <%Wallabri> hate that
[1:39:27] <%Jack_of_No_Trades> doesn't it have like a screw gear that does the resistance?
[1:39:28] <%Pookiedaexzile> Wait till Fighting games need you to do half trigger pull commands
[1:39:29] <MicrotonalMatt> That sounds cool but that also sounds like a bad dev could cause some serious tendinitis
[1:39:30] <42nfl19> what?
[1:39:30] <+Grayhammatter> what?
[1:39:31] <+Opal_Overture> Hey, is it a horror game like we all wanted?
[1:39:33] <@PlagueOfGripes> induce vomiting like 10 times in a row!!
[1:39:34] <powerprotoman> if you want a better example play the best game on ps5 astros play room the gun has the most insane use of adaptive trigger
[1:39:37] <huskarl_zap> Snaxpilled
[1:39:39] <+thegreenbenis> God do they come out half disolved? @PatStaresAt
[1:39:41] <%BoxNavy> well go puke i guess
[1:39:41] <reonome> how is this game real
[1:39:44] <+Piejumper5814> *punches muppet* NO! NOT THAT ONE DANMIT SPIT IT OUT
[1:39:45] <Tuna_Can_0> I can't tell if that was a real tip WutFace
[1:39:48] <+mlow44> Those triggers are almost assuredly going to break pretty easily with how hard people are going to end up crushing them in stressful situations
[1:39:49] <mar_krow> This is that village of cannibals logic they get by having that person write to others before killing them
[1:39:53] <AFlyingTaco1> The trigger can offer different levels of resistance, basically
[1:39:54] <%AEUG_Ace_Kamille> @pookiedaexzile stop that.

[1:41:51] <%VHGS> is this not already dark?
[1:41:53] <alvaroeltz> yea, pretty open interpretation
[1:41:55] <Louie_Salmon> This game feels like someone wanted to make Pokemon Snap, but also Bloodborne, and also they were british, and also they had "exclusive launch title" money
[1:41:56] <+Dimfish> id say it already went dark when that vuy talked about his wife leaving him but okay
[1:41:57] <rcand9> i just watched a full walkthrough gee ready to sub dude

[1:42:05] <huskarl_zap> Pact certain?
[1:42:05] <%CoolGuyMcHotPants_> the copntract has been sealed
[1:42:09] <%Ohheyitssean> The game already feels pretty sinister to me
[1:42:12] <+g0atmeal> Razby evolves into Razbeotto
[1:42:12] <chancho4tierra> HORRIBLE DEFORM SOME PEOPLE
[1:42:18] <+OwlLightningMage> EAT HIS PETS
[1:42:22] <%ChestMimik> Gramble you want the lovecraftian horrors or not
[1:42:24] <+ChurchMILFs> 20 hours of bugsnax for 5 bucks of sub money EZ

[1:42:27] <%greasypete00> COVER THE PET IN SHIT
[1:42:28] <+gitgouda> bugsnax bugnet time
[1:42:32] <BalloniWright> So Gramble doesn't eat bugsnax?

[1:42:44] <fuji_92> MAKE HIM EAT HIS PETS

[2:09:21] <%Punchasaur> Punchasaur subscribed with Prime. They've subscribed for 7 months! this game has an unsettling "don't ask how the sausage is made" vibe and its putting me on edge
[2:09:24] <%Roasted_Pheasant> Lizbert is a fucking SKELETON
[2:09:33] <%ChestMimik> Imagine this mixed with beastars

[2:10:40] <oozebear> I'm gonna call it from here. The main character ate Lizbert somehow and took on aspects of them which is why the mayor guy was confused at the start of the game

[2:27:53] <VritraReiRei> To be fair, you said, "I don't know if I will get in MUCH Yakuza 7"
[2:27:56] <%Punchasaur> yakuza dethroned by bugsnax
[2:27:58] <%TIME_PUNCHER> What if the real bugsnax were the horrors we encountered along the way
[2:27:59] <%ChestMimik> What is Wambus' secret?
[2:28:02] <cipher758> what's with the eyes man
[2:28:04] <ExpressNode> So do people love this game or is it just a meme?
[2:28:05] <jellssssss20> Did Zangief pee on head?
[2:28:08] <AFlyingTaco1> @jellssssss20 It's his cum rag
[2:28:09] <JohnA83> How's the game?
[2:28:15] <%rumtumtugnutz> I'm disappointed that no Yakuza 7, but we did get to watch this rampaging garbage fire that I hope you don't stream again.
[2:28:15] <MarvelousMrD> this gives me secret horror game vibes
[2:28:15] <theanora1> I hope you feel better later, Pat!
[2:28:16] <+Piejumper5814> pat you already saw wambus's secret
[2:28:19] <%drinkmoxie> Is this a one off or will you be returning to bugsnsx
[2:28:19] <JumbleJams> this is a good game
[2:28:24] <trig201> seems like people actually like it
[2:28:30] <agustorm123> I want that drug that people took when they created this game
[2:28:31] <AFlyingTaco1> It's a pretty damn good game
[2:28:32] <+taltalheights> It you find a Thousand Island bush, please destroy it
[2:28:38] <%doc_ock_rokc> @PatStaresAt bait a crabble over!
[2:28:43] <%Superspider51> @Piejumper5814 he has to specifically catch Wambus at that time
[2:28:49] <%sashagreenspiderqueen> @PatStaresAt if you havent already found out, you can skip around the day by sleeping in yours or lizbert's bed
[2:28:51] <%AncelDeLambert> cowards
[2:28:57] <i47h26qv2ec7chjj> why has pat a towel on his bald head????
[2:28:57] <%rumtumtugnutz> @jellssssss20 He has a migraine
[2:28:58] <%AzureGale> Also destroy any ranch bushes
[2:28:59] <agustorm123> Probably LSD
[2:29:00] <jellssssss20> Please replace each and every Ranch bush with Casear bushes
[2:29:01] <maverickdrifter> Yeah it’s cool and apparently has a lot more going on than what appears on the surface
[2:29:02] <%AncelDeLambert> just sell the bush to IN'n'Out
[2:29:03] <TastySammiches> I feel like this game is gonna fuck some kids UP
[2:29:14] <%AzureGale> @i47h26qv2ec7chjj BIG headache

[2:29:42] <%Superspider51> this game is actually fucking great
[2:29:42] <mar_krow> Butterfree

[2:30:02] <%Captainahab_37> it's okay when Nintendo does it psaWhat
[2:30:05] <AFlyingTaco1> @extradopeness Just a shitty meme leftover from the first trailer that painted the game as a horror game
[2:30:06] <GypsyMagi> @PatStaresAt feed someone as many bugsnax as you can
[2:30:11] <%ChestMimik> This game is working harder to sell me on a PS5 than fucking DMCV and Demon Souls combined
[2:30:12] <%doc_ock_rokc> @AncelDeLambert this is like some eldrich horror is trying to help these creatures but doesn't understand how food works

[3:30:27] <+JonWhoLovesFlatWomen> good ol akiyama
[3:30:31] <VaudeVille_Villain_> Super Chunk does the raping around here. And it's not rape.
[3:30:33] <+paladinstarbuster> MORE LIKE TOO SWOLE
[3:30:33] <lordchum1150> Which yakuza game had the scary badass assassin that tries to kill Kiryu
[3:30:36] <%Broken_Sonex> SUPER CHUNK - AIN'T GETTING RAPPED
[3:30:36] <AFlyingTaco1> He basically laughs when she says that she's afraid of being raped on the way home.
[3:30:36] <+DERGONS86> WOW
[3:30:37] <InugamiTheHound> I remember that shit
[3:30:37] <seaechiowai> hana is too good for akiyama
[3:30:38] <tanarath> uh huh
[3:30:39] <%T_Sasquatch> She lost weight and he fucked her LUL
[3:30:41] <%cvp5127> now shes desirable
[3:30:41] <B4k4ryuBanzai> Good for her.
[3:30:43] <%Mr_y1096> truly and inspireing tale
[3:30:43] <devanmuse> Kiryu walks up to random Chinese guy: "Hey, are you in the Triads?"
[3:30:44] <hassanico2> @PatStaresAt But she's fat again by Dead Souls
[3:30:45] <%VHGS> huh
[3:30:45] <%KiryujiKazamoto> she starved herself from worry
[3:30:46] <%greasypete00> DOES SHE GET RAPED BECAUSE SHE LOST THE WEIGHT COS THATD BE FUCKED UP
[3:30:46] <%HitchhikingThrough> DOESN'T WORK LIKE THAT
[3:30:48] <parkslady> LUL
[3:30:48] <+zanzibar_junker> She looks horrible skinny too
[3:30:50] <BerryliciousDefinition> That sucks, man
[3:30:52] <colzack_> I the remaster they changed that line so now he says she'd be able to beat up anyone who'd try to @PatStaresAt
[3:30:52] <+starzo0> its okay, hes morally grey, we talked about this on the sub reddit
[3:30:56] <%fat_burtreynolds> Good ol super chonk got cute tho at the end of the game
[3:30:57] <justinjones1989> And then she walked home and was raped?
[3:30:58] <+LandOfTheWay> @PatStaresAt it's not that she worked hard. she starved herself cause she was depressed akiyama was away
[3:30:59] <ManlyMcBeefington> not working hard, being sad about not being with akiyama made her not eat alot
[3:31:02] <+paladinstarbuster> Dont be fat people. It aint beautiful
[3:31:02] <$Skelemungus> super chunk
[3:31:03] <+UrielCobalt> Japan was kinda pimped out by Nazis and subsequently covert Fascist from the States, so makes sense
[3:31:07] <Iam_Dead> no, she was super worried about akiyama and couldn't eat.
[3:31:09] <%Livelinne> woolieOMG woolieOMG woolieOMG woolieOMG
[3:31:10] <mrapplebucks> Time to kidnap an old man
[3:31:10] <%HitchhikingThrough> O h
[3:31:12] <heart_ablaze> ok....why do we like these games again?
[3:31:14] <%CommanderSqueaks> This sounds like a cult.
[3:31:18] <hassanico2> @colzack_ you can still here Akiyama say RAPE-u
[3:31:20] <%Broken_Sonex> And then she got fat again, right?
[3:31:22] <%MonsterEnvy> @PatStaresAt Question is this main plot or side story
[3:31:23] <%superc37> GEE I WONDER WHY
[3:31:27] <%Jack_of_No_Trades> Did they make it better or worse somehow?
[3:31:29] <madtrixr> i mean that was like....10 years ago
[3:31:29] <%CommanderSqueaks> @LandOfTheWay That's so much worse.
[3:31:34] <B4k4ryuBanzai> Probably USA translators changed it, of course
[3:31:35] <qu3kl41n_the_impure_king> oh boi abusive retirement home here we go
[3:31:37] <AFlyingTaco1> Stomp his head in right now!
[3:31:37] <+starzo0> @heart_ablaze cause 90% its good
[3:31:37] <%AzureGale> This dude still fucking sucks
[3:31:40] <%HitchhikingThrough> "it's not that she worked hard. she starved herself cause she was depressed akiyama was away"
[3:31:44] <%shunakiyama> they still left in Saejima nearly raping haruka after escaping prison though which was a weird scene @PatStaresAt
[3:31:45] <%greasypete00> i like green dude's style
[3:31:48] <%Mr_Pylon> time to raid the old folks home
[3:31:49] <+LandOfTheWay> @CommanderSqueaks FUCKIN YUP
[3:31:49] <%Piemen99> ISNT THIS GUY A SUPER FUCKED UP PIMP
[3:31:51] <Spudnacious_Dynasty> The dad is a counterfeiter.
[3:31:51] <%bevyrage> remember that the ex police/dmv officer is 59 years old. i really hope the plan is him going undercover into the retirement home
[3:32:00] <nmaten> punch your way in
[3:32:03] <hassanico2> @shunakiyama they're not gonna remove a CG cutscene
[3:32:06] <%linSP> two jobs??
[3:32:07] <%CommanderSqueaks> Ichiban is about to run in there dick first.
[3:32:12] <madtrixr> things change in 10 years
[3:32:15] <%Broken_Sonex> @Piemen99 SHUT UP THO
[3:32:16] <+JonWhoLovesFlatWomen> ya the saejima knocking down haruka scene is super awkward
[3:32:18] <reonome> sort of buddies LUL
[3:32:19] <HeroToxiko> In th remake he says she's a strong woman or a fighter or something
[3:32:22] <ulcaban> It is not a great idea
[3:32:27] <%CommanderSqueaks> No it's not a great idea.
[3:32:27] <SpeedFetishist> let's ask the GUILD MASTER for help
[3:32:28] <AFlyingTaco1> This one might actually be too much. Like seriously, fuck this prick.
[3:32:29] <%HitchhikingThrough> Oh Ichiban is so radically different from Kiryu
[3:32:33] <%MrBorisMakarov> PAT
[3:32:33] <heart_ablaze> @starzo0 yeah, but shitty stuff like that can overshadow the good stuff. at least for me anyway
[3:32:34] <%CommanderSqueaks> This is a really dumb idea.
[3:32:34] <%fat_burtreynolds> 🦠 gvirus lockdown 🦠
[3:32:35] <%josstyl_0> IS YELLOW VEST MAN THE 4TH CHARACTER???
[3:32:36] <+zanzibar_junker> Remember Kiryu's dad murdered a lot of innocent people
[3:32:39] <CrimsonFox777> Wait, is SHE the one doing the dicking or....?
[3:32:40] <TurtleButter> So, am I out of the loop, or is Yakuza just getting dubs now?
[3:32:40] <%Piemen99> FUCK
[3:32:41] <%HitchhikingThrough> Kiryu would have punched his way in immediately
[3:32:43] <%Mr_Pylon> and then she can get back to this greasy soapladnd where we REUSE BATHWATER
[3:32:46] <+paladinstarbuster> Running a soapland isnt an evil thing people. Ichiban LITERALY grew up in one and was raised by its owner
[3:32:46] <madtrixr> i mean we do see her beat up dudes after that, so that at least bares out
[3:32:50] <%Mendin> Why does that pimps voice remind me of Kim Jong Un from Team America
[3:32:51] <%josstyl_0> OK
[3:32:55] <FourthQueen> Why is Hideaki Anno a Yakuza party member
[3:32:57] <%CommanderSqueaks> Two real questions, is prostitution legal in Japan and do they have unions?
[3:33:01] <calamarvelous> The 4th character is ME
[3:33:02] <UlriktheSlayer1> i cant wait to find out
[3:33:03] <+tigerfang86> Ichiban's..... superior charm?>????
[3:33:03] <%Broken_Sonex> "PUT OUT FOR MY BUISNESS, LADIES!"
[3:33:04] <+Rekinsinn> OL Kreygasn
[3:33:05] <%Jekado> She is not an office lady.
[3:33:06] <+tigerfang86> ahahahahaah no
[3:33:06] <%MonsterEnvy> @PatStaresAt She could also be an idiot
[3:33:07] <GeltonZ> I *REALLY* wanna know why the office lady joins up with these idiots!
[3:33:08] <+LandOfTheWay> office lady anger is my guess; they have A LOT to be pissed about
[3:33:08] <+KuchenKlauer> KuchenKlauer subscribed with Prime. 
[3:33:09] <+zanzibar_junker> She's a hostess Pat
[3:33:10] <%stabbityrabbit> "And then I can get back to yelling and being abusive towards her!" - This fucking asshole pimp
[3:33:11] <promessav2> so kiryu does fight women
[3:33:12] <%AzureGale> Because nothing drives men more than a HOT GIRL /s
[3:33:12] <$Skelemungus> we will find out
[3:33:12] <InugamiTheHound> Kiryu's dad is assassin for the Tojo and Kazamza clan
[3:33:15] <%Monkeyweed21> @HitchhikingThrough Whorphanage vs murder orphanage
[3:33:16] <Spudnacious_Dynasty> Cause she is probably way cooler than any of you and likes having lackeys
[3:33:17] <+Delenay> is it the office lady from this work place?
[3:33:18] <Slim_Lipid> Why would a woman join the party if the hobo is the white mage 🤔

[3:34:49] <COMB711> mascot please
[3:34:50] <%bevyrage> @CommanderSqueaks prostitution is legal if it's not the primary and publicly advertised service. soaplands/bath houses/massage therapists/etc can run prostitution on the side. in regards to unions: SUPER RARE!!! you're more likely to find a union in a western videogame company than any establishment that runs prostitution on the side.

[3:49:59] <+tigerfang86> POUNDMATES
[3:50:00] <+AtlasMcCoy> Remember, if you're worried about DMCA, just mute your game's music and sound effects and play in complete silence. As god intended.

[3:53:16] <%KiryujiKazamoto> hmm, i wonder why chat wants him to do it on stream. i have no guess :I
[3:53:17] <%Too_Much_Nukie> Grind the management game in stream UNTIL you get the party member.
[3:53:17] <+SunnyVarietyPack> Don’t do it on stream I just finished it. Took allll day
[3:53:19] <%Eaglestrike117> Theres a thing if you do it
[3:53:23] <%Jaromero435> Do at least the first bit, you will know when
[3:53:26] <JumbleJams> @Ultimatefool go to the top of the map
[3:53:26] <madtrixr> theres some Stuff in management but doing it on stream would be a whole time

[4:08:28] <AFlyingTaco1> There's fucking Fire Emblem tea time in this too, of course.
[4:08:28] <%penitentpendant> He perfect guarded the explosion, he's fine
[4:08:28] <TundraOW> Kashiwagi LIVED
[4:08:30] <stevenlambchops> It's his twin brother just like Kazuma's twin from 3
[4:08:32] <%fat_burtreynolds> But pat when are you gonna kareoke?
[4:08:32] <%MrBorisMakarov> GOD SOCIAL LINKS WHERES ATLUS NAME IN THE CREDITS

[4:08:39] <Make_me_mad> The explosion had rubber shrapnel.
[4:08:41] <akitanito> rubber explosion
[4:08:41] <+tigerfang86> He EXPLODED
[4:08:43] <SwindlerOfProgress> @PatStaresAt The bar is called Survive, isn't it?
[4:08:46] <%Mr_Pylon> He's too young for it, but could be a clone!
[4:08:51] <%Pookiedaexzile> No one really ever dies
[4:08:55] <hassanico2> @PatStaresAt How many cutscene bullets we talking here?
[4:08:57] <BoSteed> Explosions aren't proof of anything
[4:08:58] <InfiniteSwagbito> Don't worry Kashiwagi is practiced in RoyalGuard and had enough DT to take the hit
[4:09:01] <%Broken_Sonex> THE EXPLOTION WAS RUBBER
[4:09:01] <%fat_burtreynolds> Kept you waiting huh?
[4:09:01] <dinnydanny777> Guns don't kill people, Yakuza kill people Kappa
[4:09:03] <Madax_Rixala> But did you see a body? No body, no death.

[4:09:10] <%Jekado> across the bridge
[4:09:11] <Make_me_mad> I'm beginning to think no one has ever died in the Yakuza series.
[4:09:15] <%fat_burtreynolds> Ketchup Bullets
[4:09:16] <UlriktheSlayer1> hey if you dont seen him die then he didnt die
[4:09:21] <+Mitchellsocks> Helicopter Machine Guns ain't shit, remember Yakuza 6?
[4:09:21] <KaironFortressKnight> So far I prefer this game way more than any Persona game. On the sole fact that everyone is older than me for once.
[4:09:23] <+rickelstiltskin> to be fair the bar is called Survive
[4:09:24] <sponsoredviewer910> did he die harder than the guy on the helicopter kiryu blew up with a rocket launcher?
[4:09:29] <AMaidIndeed> Was Nanbe wielding a Pine Tree?
[4:09:29] <InfiniteSwagbito> @BoxNavy "Somehow, Kashiwagi has returned."
[4:09:31] <+tigerfang86> the only person who's ever died in Yakuza is Nishiki
[4:09:33] <+tigerfang86> that's it
[4:09:33] <hassanico2> Kazuma is DEFINITELY super dead
[4:09:34] <Blank9> it could always be his identical CIA twin
[4:09:35] <hassanico2> And Shimano
[4:09:35] <majindusto> To be fair...Kiryu survived SO MUCH BULLSHIT
[4:09:39] <InugamiTheHound> @PatStaresAt what about nishiyama?H eis dead AF as well
[4:09:41] <hassanico2> And all those people who exploded the millenium tower
[4:09:42] <jorniev> THE GUY FORM 3?
[4:09:43] <+ZoltanBMagnus> "No one's every really gone"
[4:09:44] <SomeAsianDood> Dojima died @tigerfang86
[4:09:46] <%ccwettr123> God I hope shakedown exists in this game
[4:09:46] <CrimsonFox777> What about those lieutenants at the end of 0?
[4:09:47] <+Mitchellsocks> @sponsoredviewer910 By the Law of Yakuza, they survived
[4:09:49] <hassanico2> And Munakata
[4:09:51] <BallisticMeerkat> Whats the point of an atm in this game?
[4:09:51] <nmaten> they were rubber helicopter machine gun bullets
[4:09:51] <+LandOfTheWay> people come back to life in the yakuza games more than dc comics
[4:09:56] <%shunakiyama> Kashiwagi in 3 was shot about 3000 times with a mini gun and then exploded straight after.
[4:09:57] <%mister___doctor> GOOD
[4:09:57] <akitanito> Nishiki is just Ichiban
[4:09:59] <%JetpackMcQuack> what a claim
[4:10:00] <TundraOW> Nishiki only died because he's a bitch
[4:10:00] <%Pookiedaexzile> The person whose ever died in Yakuza is the Purple haired lady
[4:10:02] <+Solutha> kiryu will never die
[4:10:02] <Spudnacious_Dynasty> Still waiting to find out about George Takei's dead dad
[4:10:03] <heart_ablaze> and Tachibana
[4:10:03] <AFlyingTaco1> Kiryu's dad is dead too.
[4:10:03] <COMB711> Nishki is alive in Cuba
[4:10:03] <+tigerfang86> trueeeee
[4:10:04] <Make_me_mad> But a character is only dead for sure until they return.
[4:10:04] <%Mr_Pylon> Nishiki got shot a bunch AND exploded
[4:10:04] <%mister___doctor> Fuck Nishki
[4:10:06] <%Broken_Sonex> Also Mine
[4:10:08] <+Mitchellsocks> Honestly, I think Ryuji could still be alive
[4:10:11] <%Cozy90> what about that dude who got shot with an arrow
[4:10:19] <hassanico2> Nichiki lives on, through Ichiban's ARM! I mean, uh, VA!
[4:10:19] <Madax_Rixala> Watch Nishki come back as a Cyborg
[4:10:20] <%shurtal> What about that one guy Kiryu totally killed?
[4:10:20] <%Eaglestrike117> what about that bar owner from Zero and One?
[4:10:21] <+Snektor> Wait what about that guy that died because of the exploding van in 6...or was that 0?
[4:10:23] <SomeAsianDood> Ryuji's alive if you count dead souls
[4:10:23] <Srthunda> what about that hobo that got the crossbow bolt to the head
[4:10:24] <AFlyingTaco1> Awano is super dead.
[4:10:25] <KaironFortressKnight> No way man, Nishiki is definitely ali-*shot from offscreen*
[4:10:26] <$Skelemungus> kiryu died on screen like 3 times
[4:10:28] <InfiniteSwagbito> @Cozy90 Maybe he got a Stand outta it, who knows

[5:50:24] <TheChapyGuy> the chat thinks Epstein, and I think of Johnny Depp in Nightmare on Elm Street 1
[5:50:25] <medril07> gotta pull his pants back up
[5:50:25] <+tetraes> pull his pants down
[5:50:25] <%king_wragles> It's way more reasonable to assume he just hung himself 6 feet off the floor on a banister he would need help getting to. No foul play at all... nope

[6:14:44] <uncle_speeps> this is persona if it was fun
[6:14:48] <%SomeSageAdvice> @heartlesshealer their equips and main attacks deal with hammer/mace but all their spells are exclusively buff/debuff/stat stuff
[6:14:49] <+keyoray> @madtrixr thanks, completely forgot. I was just thinking of her straight stats
[6:14:51] <CrankyVT> Yeah, she's rank 1 so her stats have to catch up a little
[6:14:51] <MagmaLycan> wtf that a hitachi?
[6:14:53] <+starzo0> @SoFarFetched i just wanted my one, i'll keep it at that, np

[6:15:34] <%AzureGale> Looks like there's room for three more people
[6:15:37] <%CommanderSqueaks> @MasterTonberry23 Someone hasn't watched the third season of Aggretsuko.
[6:15:40] <+PenmanLupine> wtf is that Sexy Microphone
[6:15:44] <%SaiyanShoto> So she punches and she's voiced by Makoto too?
[6:15:44] <%heartlesshealer> @SomeSageAdvice Ah, so it was just on the equip side. Oh well, should still get into A2 again someday. Thank you
[6:15:44] <trickquestionz> THATS A MACE
[6:15:46] <madtrixr> @MasterTonberry23 you wanna tell her that after seeing her fight? i wouldnt
[6:15:49] <%honeyman18> Well, know what class I'm doing on my run with her
[6:15:50] <+mashinchaserr> technically it's better for her
[6:15:57] <+Solutha> MASSIVE MASSAGE
[6:16:01] <%ClericOfSparda> Man, he cannot get to <spoiler> fast enough
[6:16:01] <%Spydurman> get that massager Kappa
[6:16:04] <Para1ars> I thought it said tactical bag
[6:16:05] <MasterTonberry23> @CommanderSqueaks whats that, one of those annie mays i keep hearing about?
[6:16:11] <DublinRage> I want construction man to be GEOMANCER
[6:16:12] <venomfury86> IT'S GROWING!!!
[6:16:16] <MagmaLycan> beat people up with the hitachi
[6:16:19] <+tigerfang86> wow that's pretty good
[6:16:20] <+RocketBarrel> Oh God, is Saeko's weapon the Message Machine?
[6:16:22] <%BoxNavy> red = good btw
[6:16:23] <%ClericOfSparda> MY DESIRE
[6:16:26] <%penitentpendant> I just wish the colors were inverted
[6:16:27] <%Spydurman> get the Hitachi LUL
[6:16:27] <Guardiansaiyan> Red for Dante and Blue for Vergil?
[6:16:29] <MasterTonberry23> red is good, blue is bad, which is kinda backwards but ok
[6:16:29] <%T_Sasquatch> Holy shit there might be more members LUL
[6:16:30] <%roscoe_rosaline> Super good
[6:16:32] <%CommanderSqueaks> @MasterTonberry23 You're watching a thirty year old man play the 7th Yakuza game, you can't make that joke.
[6:16:34] <MasterTonberry23> i mean, fuck
[6:16:37] <InfiniteSwagbito> Red being good and blue being bad is throwing me
[6:16:38] <+Edrem> looks like the screens got space for way more characters?
[6:16:39] <%penitentpendant> Maybe they'll patch that?
[6:16:40] <%king_wragles> @RocketBarrel Ichiban's
[6:16:43] <+PJSmooth> The massage bat is too good
[6:16:46] <Guardiansaiyan> @penitentpendant just think of it as Dante and Vergil numbers
[6:16:47] <%Piemen99> WHAT
[6:16:48] <%SomeSageAdvice> @heartlesshealer ye, apparently you can get some stuff to mix in with the Assassin job for Green Mage?
[6:16:56] <MasterTonberry23> @CommanderSqueaks pats 30? Oh god I'm old
[6:16:56] <%heartlesshealer> Buffs/debuffs aren't magic-stat dependent I would think, so maybe half-helmet for our new barmaid
[6:16:59] <%BoxNavy> @penitentpendant they wont. red = good has always been a yakuza thing
[6:16:59] <%Monkeyweed21> Mahou Shojo maybe
[6:17:06] <+Link232> I find it weird how Yakuza 7 has some amazing QoL features like these stat screens but also misses a lot of QoL like what the stats actually do and not having speed-up for auto battle
[6:17:07] <+PenmanLupine> oof. JRPGs with a ton of party members get me good
[6:17:08] <%AzureGale> These boots were made for walkin'
[6:17:10] <Guardiansaiyan> @InfiniteSwagbito think of the colors adn Dante and Vergil
[6:17:11] <+razielhex> ...hitachi wand
[6:17:11] <%Not_Dutch_> so, does the massager make their legs weak?
[6:17:11] <%penitentpendant> @Guardiansaiyan The power of motivation
[6:17:12] <$RealThiele> oh myy
[6:17:14] <+razielhex> DILDO SWORD
[6:17:16] <+razielhex> HELL YEAH
[6:17:17] <+starzo0> isnt it red good cause its ichibans colour
[6:17:17] <%DianaTheAscian> Idol is prob a proper healer
[6:17:22] <lordchum1150> Hey guys I gets ps5 pretty soon, is the devil may cry special edition worth it or should I just download Vergil for the ps4?
[6:17:28] <Guardiansaiyan> @penitentpendant lol
[6:17:31] <star_feline> So Ichiban will beat people up with a big dildo vibrator?
[6:17:32] <+CherteuseKapibara> HITACHI XL
[6:17:37] <SomersaultJustice> can anyone be any class?
[6:17:38] <%honeyman18> Don't forget to equip
[6:17:40] <+LandOfTheWay> when does ichiban get his Bad Dragon Bat?
[6:17:44] <Guardiansaiyan> @starzo0 just think of the colors as Dante and Vergil
[6:17:46] <%king_wragles> @DianaTheAscian I'm thinking of ranged support
[6:17:49] <%penitentpendant> @BoxNavy More hoping a low chance they give an option in a patch to switch colors
[6:17:49] <KingVantq> hot
[6:17:50] <MasterTonberry23> It's a neck massager!
[6:17:50] <+tigerfang86> it's VITAL that you do that
[6:17:50] <Gallhint> idol class is probably charmer
[6:17:53] <%rkbinder> rkbinder subscribed at Tier 1. They've subscribed for 3 months! Thanks for all the content, found out about you when you started the 2018 God of War playthru.
[6:17:54] <DashXero> There are worse ways to go.
[6:17:54] <B_R1CE> had to wait 10 minutes to say this, but great channel :)
[6:17:56] <G03933> is this Saints Row?
[6:17:57] <%heartlesshealer> @SomeSageAdvice I tended to make the girls into Elementalist Summoners, but I'll experiment with that when I get my own copy :0c
[6:17:58] <+razielhex> It's SAINTS ROW 3 all over again!
[6:17:59] <$RealThiele> classy
[6:17:59] <%Punchasaur> Kreygasm Kreygasm
[6:18:00] <UlriktheSlayer1> just like saints row and thats awesome
[6:18:01] <%BoxNavy> @lordchum1150 if you dont care about raytracing or legendary dark knight mode just get vergil on ps4
[6:18:01] <+keyoray> it's just a vibrator, not a dildo
[6:18:03] <%Piemen99> HOLY SHIT
[6:18:03] <%HitchhikingThrough> I'd be upset if you didn't
[6:18:05] <%weissguard> Well, she's the best.
[6:18:06] <%HitchhikingThrough> Yooooo
[6:18:06] <+FleshFriend> m a s s a g e d
[6:18:07] <MagmaLycan> TEXAS SIZED HITACHI
[6:18:16] <RaidenRising> SHE IS COOL
[6:18:16] <%honeyman18> Does that make it a Vibrosword?
[6:18:18] <%nevan_44> HELL YEAH
[6:18:19] <Sulfur_Boride> Imagine getting your ass beaten by some delusional 40-year-old manchild with a giant vibrator.
[6:18:19] <SomersaultJustice> just need a giant mosaic on it at all times
[6:18:21] <%CommanderSqueaks> You can hear it vibrate when he hits them.
[6:18:22] <whimsicallifestyle> saeko can destroy me
[6:18:22] <%roscoe_rosaline> Beat some mf with a magic wand.
[6:18:22] <godzookylives> some Saints Row shit
[6:18:23] <+Mrbaconator> M A S S A G E D
[6:18:39] <%DianaTheAscian> thats a no no
[6:18:41] <lordchum1150> @boxnavy will probably just grab Vergil then. Thanks!
[6:18:42] <Jnkolm> I think it tells you the item's equipped
[6:18:42] <%Ynkubus_> C L I M A X E D
[6:18:43] <%Higure_yoru> ITS A SHOULDER MASSAGER THAT PEOPLE USE AS A DILDO
[6:18:44] <+starzo0> @Guardiansaiyan so depression go up and ambition go down, thats my normal!
[6:18:45] <$RealThiele> thats actually awful
[6:18:45] <MasterTonberry23> @Sulfur_Boride I can imagine that, I'm sure theres an old video on youtube of that exact thing happening
[6:18:47] <%Broken_Sonex> @Sulfur_Boride I would say I'm in an anime
[6:18:47] <%BoxNavy> monkaS
[6:18:48] <star_feline> a wand for the BIGGEST vaginas
[6:18:50] <the_sprankton> ten bucks for a hand grenade?
[6:18:57] <UlriktheSlayer1> yeah not great
[6:18:58] <%SomeSageAdvice> @heartlesshealer i was actually super hoping that we might get Green Mage in FFXIV sometime soon, but Pat hyped up Chemist for me
[6:19:01] <icantstopthescreams> That sounds super irritating
[6:19:08] <DashXero> It's a dildo that people use as a shoulder massager.
[6:19:10] <%roscoe_rosaline> Does it at least give a warning?
[6:19:13] <%BoxNavy> hooray
[6:19:14] <+tigerfang86> QUEST IT UP
[6:19:15] <TheSinner42> it does tell you on the right though so thats nice
[6:19:16] <MasterTonberry23> you could probably massage two necks at once with that thing
[6:19:19] <%AzureGale> "Let's do some fucking" - Pat
[6:19:21] <%penitentpendant> Honestly selling is more for cleaning out inventory by those prices
[6:19:21] <Para1ars> So does the vibrator club work like those high frequency blades in Metal Gear Rising?
[6:19:21] <Guardiansaiyan> @starzo0 they had to use something!
[6:19:29] <+kamikazekripple> vibrators dont go inside
[6:19:31] <seaechiowai> are there more than one pawn shops?
[6:19:32] <%Higure_yoru> its a party popper grenade. booms in nis hero head
[6:19:33] <Godzillaahh> Does saeko get a karaoke song???
[6:19:36] <$RealThiele> become the warrior of telephone club
[6:19:36] <venomfury86> kill 20 wild boars
[6:19:43] <%kewlmyc> lol beerserker
[6:19:52] <AMaidIndeed> 'Beerserker' LUL
[6:19:53] <uncle_speeps> saeko is fast as fuck boy
[6:19:59] <MasterTonberry23> You know if she kicked with her heels it would probably do more damage
[6:20:01] <Sulfur_Boride> Saeko indeed has a karaoke song. And her dub actress I think sings it really damn well
[6:20:11] <%cvp5127> hayai
[6:20:11] <+tigerfang86> shes fast....
[6:20:14] <%penitentpendant> Wasn't there an 'autobattle' option?
[6:20:16] <%BoxNavy> well she is the buff/debuff character. makes sense
[6:20:16] <%heartlesshealer> @SomeSageAdvice Either would be great, but yeah Pat hyped up Chemist pretty good
[6:20:18] <%Nekros4442> I assume high agility compared to the rest of ur party
[6:20:19] <SomersaultJustice> he was weak to being kicked in the face
[6:20:19] <%HitchhikingThrough> Yo
[6:20:20] <+dudeenoch> can i ask if we've done the meme side quest that english has?
[6:20:24] <%Piemen99> Wow she can really run in those heels
[6:20:25] <MasterTonberry23> Saekos like a decade younger then these old fogeys
[6:20:27] <venomfury86> Pat running into people, how rude
[6:20:28] <+PenmanLupine> he was evaporated!
[6:20:29] <harlow777> yakuzie shmakuzie wheres the astro's playroom gameplay!?
[6:20:30] <%Pookiedaexzile> Ladies first...because they'll kill you aster
[6:20:31] <UlriktheSlayer1> we gotta get saeko to do karaoke...
[6:20:35] <%penitentpendant> Fair
[6:20:37] <Guardiansaiyan> would like to say...if your confused about the up and down colors of items when equiping things...just think of the colors as Dante being RED and he goes up...and Vergil being BLUE and Motivation goes down... imGlitch It just works!
[6:20:39] <$RealThiele> its technically full of bricks
[6:20:40] <uncle_speeps> OH YEAH THIS ONE
[6:20:41] <fuji_92> Y
[6:20:41] <icantstopthescreams> Hungry Hungry Homeless they arent a board game

[7:20:44] <VritraReiRei> @PatStaresAt Here's what this choice does: “I’m here to listen, Sa-chan” grants Kindness. “Well, it’s not like you gotta entertain me” grants Passion. “I’m all about boring stories!” grants Charisma.
[7:20:44] <%honeyman18> he's an unmoving model on a bed

[7:42:15] <coffeebearCafe> Demon souls good
[7:42:17] <%Too_Much_Nukie> @patstaresat The management game should be played on stream UNTIL you reach rank 100. Or reach rank 100 on-stream at least.
[7:42:19] <%Punchasaur> maiden in black Kreygasm

[7:42:56] <a_mad_dragon> characters' lips move when they talk in Demon's Souls

[7:43:23] <%Pookiedaexzile> Please nobody tell me about What happens after when you blink
[7:43:24] <%roscoe_rosaline> Ew, people born after demon souls?

[7:43:27] <DraxTD> rebooting pat

[7:43:37] <%trustycoyote> @UlriktheSlayer1 I feel ya man
[7:43:37] <DraxTD> pat.exe has crashed
[7:43:39] <+twohitgood> are you gonna do mirror mode in DeS?
[7:43:39] <@SoFarFetched> Don't Spoil who Darth Vader actually is geefPoint
[7:43:40] <%cvp5127> for now LUL
[7:43:41] <+AtlasMcCoy> inb4 another delay
[7:43:42] <MasterTonberry23> dont worry im sure cyberpunk will be delayed again Kappa
[7:43:43] <%penitentpendant> The biggest hype I have for Demon Souls: It spells hope for Bloodborne
[7:43:43] <Djinnazz> MAYBE
[7:43:44] <%Pookiedaexzile> hahahahhahahahh
[7:43:44] <%Spydurman> poll
[7:43:45] <%Dutchpotato> sure it is
[7:43:45] <promessav2> i still bet on another delay
[7:43:47] <UlriktheSlayer1> hopefully...
[7:43:47] <@SoFarFetched> you mean ""1 month""
[7:43:52] <%Pookiedaexzile> HAHAHAHAHa One month
[7:43:52] <%DianaTheAscian> MAYBE
[7:43:54] <%Broken_Sonex> Oh, who cares about DS. I want Yakuza
[7:43:56] <Djinnazz> yup
[7:43:57] <+rickelstiltskin> yup
[7:43:58] <$Skittlesoul> I bet it gets pushed again
[7:44:00] <+twohitgood> pay the 25k souls to the statue
[7:44:01] <TheNewJapanGuy> Sure it is
[7:44:02] <justinjones1989> That shit's not coming out this year
[7:44:04] <%greasypete00> it swaps your hands too
[7:44:04] <%trustycoyote> Like some Twilight Princess shit?
[7:44:05] <Djinnazz> same way in Shadow of the Colossus
[7:44:05] <%DianaTheAscian> yeah
[7:44:08] <%SaiyanShoto> From what i've seen yeah
[7:44:10] <%Monkeyweed21> THE TRASH CAN IS BACKWARDS
[7:44:10] <Blank9> but when will cyberpunk be playable without horrible gamebreaking bugs?
[7:44:12] <UlriktheSlayer1> ive actually played like every souls game but havent beaten them all, all i have left is demons souls
[7:44:19] <%DianaTheAscian> it prob is
[7:44:19] <skeletonkingofmanlets> it tests your orientaion
[7:44:20] <+CapnClassix> Goin straight for the Falchion, right?
[7:44:23] <%greasypete00> it basically mirrors the whole games image
[7:44:24] <%Ynkubus_> Its for folks like LobosJr
[7:44:24] <+rickelstiltskin> like mario kart, but with demons
[7:44:31] <%walternatorz> have you tried jerking off with your non-dominant hand?
[7:44:31] <Blank9> it's just flipped like twilight princess gamecube vs wii
[7:44:33] <%Pookiedaexzile> Cyberpunk won't be out till Feburary
[7:44:34] <%XeroSigmaPrime> It feels new and messes you up ALOT
[7:44:35] <JaceDarkstar> im in the vast minority that i doubt cyberpunk will be good. i dont even think the witcher 3 was very good
[7:44:37] <%stubborndeer> play dark souls again
[7:44:37] <%penitentpendant> I'd almost say wait a week on Cyberpunk for the first set of patches to not set computers on fire
[7:44:37] <%Pookiedaexzile> Big Truss
[7:44:39] <%linSP> its a whole new gaaaame
[7:44:42] <skeletonkingofmanlets> remember mirrored tracks innracing games?
[7:44:46] <@SoFarFetched> Mirror mode must be a challenge for dyslexic people
[7:44:47] <%Pookiedaexzile> Just do Des and Yakuza
[7:44:49] <%Broken_Sonex> If Cyberpunk comes out this year, I'll eat my toes
[7:44:49] <+rickelstiltskin> watched Lobos headbutt Max to death
[7:44:52] <+twohitgood> Des is what peope liked this week
[7:44:53] <%Cozy90> Pat i bought yakuza. Love what you've shown so far.
[7:45:07] <%Dutchpotato> neat
[7:45:07] <%WackyGear> yes
[7:45:09] <+Mrbaconator> YEEEEEEEEEEE
[7:45:10] <%arancet> helpful

[7:45:16] <nmaten> yea
[7:45:16] <%RAAAAAINMAKER> Good job
[7:45:16] <@SoFarFetched> Pat you can probably splash back in your Roguelikes into the schedule again.
[7:45:18] <%trustycoyote> Well that's good
[7:45:22] <+rickelstiltskin> because Yakuzie is a great fuckin series
[7:45:26] <%roscoe_rosaline> That's because we love YOU
[7:45:26] <%penitentpendant> It's in your wheelhouse, so hooray synergy
[7:45:27] <ZComiX> You played DeS for like an hour tho
[7:45:28] <+Mrbaconator> good job us
[7:45:28] <%DianaTheAscian> everything has hit 2k this week at some point
[7:45:30] <akitanito> I think it's just because it's late
[7:45:30] <%arancet> yakuza was also later, so...
[7:45:30] <%CommanderSqueaks> BUG SNAX
[7:45:34] <Blank9> with yakuza you get to also be an INFLUENCER
[7:45:35] <%Spydurman> LUL
[7:45:35] <%Monkeyweed21> Bugsnax is far more of a mystery than Demon Souls @PatStaresAt
[7:45:37] <rosemon5001> @PatStaresAt being i have played crash 4 wich had a feature like that about quarter into the game people get confused easily
[7:45:38] <bigtitsmagree> donald trump voice needed

[7:46:12] <%brachydios777> Any plans for Dmcv SE?
[7:46:14] <DublinRage> So if Cyberpunk doesn't come out, will Yakuza win Best RPG?
[7:46:15] <%heartlesshealer> damn, it was fucking dope though

[7:47:35] <Profmcstevie> GEAR SHIFT! DOOD MODE!
[7:47:41] <%doubleslapmeharderwhitney> I guess i'll have to get Bugsnax for myself then. But it makes me so uncomfortable
[7:47:41] <%Too_Much_Nukie> I would prefer nothing but Yakoozie but I will enjoy Demon souls too.
[7:47:43] <%SaiyanShoto> I love the enchanted falchion LUL LUL
[7:47:55] <AFlyingTaco1> German Spy is up
[7:47:55] <%coreyyotto> It's an event!
[7:47:56] <skeletonkingofmanlets> bulsht
[7:47:57] <%SaiyanShoto> matt is simmons and Mike is Wesker in his assist me
[7:47:58] <UlriktheSlayer1> damn
[7:47:58] <%Arweynn> LUL
[7:47:59] <promessav2> every paige stream is a return stream
[7:47:59] <akitanito> She sells on rarity
[7:47:59] <%heartlesshealer> LUL
[7:47:59] <%Pookiedaexzile> yeyeyeyeyeyeyeyeyeyeyeye
[7:48:00] <%arancet> with her its an EVENT
[7:48:00] <%nevan_44> from assist me
[7:48:01] <CaptainBright> ....For real?
[7:48:01] <%RadicalWeegee> ooh
[7:48:02] <+twohitgood> mike is wesker, iirc.
[7:48:03] <NeroInfinite> Even though shebarely streams
[7:48:03] <%AzureGale> Awwwwwwwwwww
[7:48:04] <%DianaTheAscian> yup
[7:48:05] <$RealThiele> well yea cause fewer
[7:48:06] <nmaten> its cause she streams once a month
[7:48:07] <%Monkeyweed21> Could be worse, could be Woolie @PatStaresAt
[7:48:07] <%heartlesshealer> sounds about right
[7:48:09] <@SoFarFetched> It's because she streams so little she always gets a bunch of donations
[7:48:10] <%brachydios777> LUL
[7:48:10] <%penitentpendant> Uber Oof
[7:48:10] <+Jaysky> Mind you she streams once every month
[7:48:10] <Gallhint> Well she streams once every millennia so
[7:48:11] <AFlyingTaco1> How are metrics determined?
[7:48:13] <%Mr_Pylon> there's a rarity to a Paige stream
[7:48:13] <%TheMattman1313> She doesn't stream to make you feel better
[7:48:15] <+twohitgood> doom is simmons
[7:48:15] <%Dutchpotato> Yeah but it's either show up to paiges stream or u don't see her for months
[7:48:15] <%Kitafin> Wesker
[7:48:16] <%RAAAAAINMAKER> Think you can squeeze in Spiderman before Cyberpunk?
[7:48:17] <coffeebearCafe> good stream doodShine
[7:48:18] <%Spydurman> LUL
[7:48:18] <@SoFarFetched> JK SImmons
[7:48:19] <Tooniearcade> woaw
[7:48:19] <%Jaxiis0> supern28BabyShark
[7:48:25] <%Punchasaur> mfw people think fire embleminvented the word falchion psaWhat
[7:48:26] <%brachydios777> Why!?
[7:48:28] <%DianaTheAscian> its weird that there are Paige only viewers
[7:48:30] <%heartlesshealer> algorithms can't nail down Paige
[7:48:31] <%Jaxiis0> sipsipSipsipblind
[7:48:31] <%Spydurman> she stopped streaming to make you feel better
[7:48:47] <%Jekado> JK Rowling?
[7:48:48] <%Kitafin> same
[7:48:50] <%Broken_Sonex> Being rare makes her valued more
[7:48:50] <%penitentpendant> Hopefully she can reach Wolnir by (Next) Halloween
[7:48:50] <%brachydios777> Simmons aka Doom
[7:48:59] <%ghostofsolomon> Pat is this your longest stream?
[7:49:01] <CaptainBright> Inb4 the lying cat image is used again
[7:49:01] <@SoFarFetched> If paige streamed everyday,she'd get more viewers than Pat. So she has to hold herself back from streaming.
[7:49:04] <bigtitsmagree> arent your balls crushed?
[7:49:05] <%heartlesshealer> there are people who only show up for the pre-paige-stream and then leave when game starts
[7:49:18] <Profmcstevie> Paige wears her limiter for Pats sake
[7:49:19] <%SaiyanShoto> Is that why you fart on Paiges stream? Because she has more people tuning in?
[7:49:23] <%Dutchpotato> yeah me
[7:49:25] <%CommanderSqueaks> Like a Dargon
[7:49:29] <skeletonkingofmanlets> so was bugsnax a letdown?
[7:49:38] <%Jaxiis0> pat you'd draw huge crowds if you spent 10+ minutes on a shadow puzzle too
[7:49:39] <+twohitgood> demon's souls
[7:49:41] <%Broken_Sonex> @SoFarFetched We don't know that. Frankly we'll never know
[7:49:42] <%Punchasaur> no
[7:49:43] <DublinRage> It's because Pat likes Simmons from RedVsBlue. He can't get enough of that show.
[7:49:45] <%Dutchpotato> what? no way
[7:49:46] <%Monkeyweed21> Human flesh is too weak to contain Paige's power
[7:49:46] <coffeebearCafe> more views more farts
[7:49:47] <UlriktheSlayer1> yeah
[7:49:50] <%CommanderSqueaks> Oh god.
[7:49:50] <%DianaTheAscian> no
[7:49:50] <nmaten> demon's holes

[7:49:54] <UlriktheSlayer1> its annyoing to remember

[7:50:24] <UlriktheSlayer1> i think ive developed a habit of making sure every time i write the name to add the s to demon
[7:50:25] <CaptainBright> @ghostofsolomon You think this is long? Remember, he streams FFXIV
[7:50:27] <@SoFarFetched> and then pat beats it
[7:50:32] <Oxybe> OK but Bugsnax tho
