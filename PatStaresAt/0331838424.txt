[0:15:22] <NewWillinium> @Guardiansaiyan My thanks for the welcome! @Kage_96 Ooh. I wonder if that demo is on the Xbox One at the moment. I know that demos tend to be rather dead on the platform
[0:15:22] <%Derc127> Goblin Slayer is just some fun schlock
[0:15:23] <KaiserMario> @AngriestPat CLAIRE B is at 52m00s on PC

[0:15:43] <42nfl19> The English VA for the Goblin Slayer is apparently going to be the voice of Doom Slayer?
[0:15:46] <+PenmanLupine> The problem with Goblin Slayer is the obnoxious 14 year olds that get off on other people being angry pushing it everywhere and comparing it to better stuff. It's a fine nothing special series. thats it.
[0:15:47] <Graxe_> 2:34:00 exactly.

[0:46:41] <+Gespens> FF7 is probably older than half of your youtube audience!
[0:46:42] <alcors_wisdom> @Dio_TR dont put that on us shes a canadian now
[0:46:43] <tank7013> I'm so thankful I grew up with games before my time so that I could appreciate older games
[0:46:44] <%Doctor_Death_Bed> @kaitepaints because you are considered a government worker, well at least I was, cant be seen drinking when you represent the americas
[0:46:46] <$actionhanktx> FINALLY RE2 Claire Scenario!!
[0:46:46] <Fujiwara_92> i was alive, i just didnt have a psx FeelsBadMan
[0:46:48] <%PipIV> I was alive.. just not coherent
[0:46:48] <dagreenpillow> I think this is me with the ye olde Deus Ex
[0:46:49] <$GohanEgret> @Qsmash_ nope, hasn't started yet
[0:46:49] <+terracornholio> I remember the commercials, but didn't care for it
[0:46:49] <marsano168> I was like 4 when it came out
[0:46:50] <b1gboss007> Just 2 people can't
[0:46:51] <$ImasukyLomae> !raffle
[0:46:51] <@Moobot> Added one or more users to the raffle
[0:46:51] <zamzoph> METAL GEAR?!
[0:46:52] <%ssjklyco> I used to think MGS 2 was the pinnacle of graphics.
[0:46:53] <suikudo> UHHHH
[0:46:55] <%badchoice5> @AngriestPat Paige, how many bits do we have to donate to bring Yang back to life?
[0:46:55] <+Antoids> star fox 64 as well, though that aged perfectly
[0:46:55] <%joylent_blue> Qsmash_ claire B? nah hasn't started yet
[0:46:56] <acexclover> hey pat are you a fan of monster hunter? just got monster hunter world and have been obsessed with it
[0:46:56] <%NewWillinium> I still argue that Final Fantasy Crisis Core is leagues better then Final fantasy 7
[0:46:57] <fruit_pie_the_magician> It's like watching thirties movies for special effects
[0:46:57] <prime_name> I was technically alive when FF7 and MGS1 came out.
[0:46:57] <Tracazoid> There's like two dozen enemies in MGS1.
[0:47:00] <+HostilePoundcakes> i'm not young you're just old pat Kappa
[0:47:01] <mistspade> I was 2 when FF7 was released.
[0:47:02] <$GohanEgret> @zamzoph PSYCHO MANTIS?
[0:47:03] <+LogothX> Blew peoples minds??
[0:47:06] <%thunderdutch> There are people who weren't alive when FF7 came out? I was like... 15?
[0:47:06] <marsano168> I didnt play ff7 til a decade after it came out
[0:47:06] <MiraiUsagi> i remember watching my brothers playing the old psx games, and when i played them i loved them
[0:47:07] <+Nero9341> i was 4 when ff7 came out
[0:47:08] <+LogothX> Nostalgia?
[0:47:09] <SiegeJay> WHY IS THAT CAT GETTING FLUFFIER
[0:47:09] <hazardkujacker> I was there when FF7 happened... and then Valkyrie Profile came out and FF7 lost any appeal to me
[0:47:11] <%MelBrooksKA> MGS's controls were pretty primitive for the time too
[0:47:14] <+Gespens> FFX is one of the first JRPGs to be fully voiced
[0:47:15] <suikudo> Paige.... MGS defined a damn genre
[0:47:15] <+Undenizen> Hiding in boxes blew peoples minds.
[0:47:18] <%ThatGuyfromMars> wow old man yelling at cloud
[0:47:19] <+LogothX> The first polygon graphic game huh...
[0:47:20] <CastellanVon> Big ass 3D game
[0:47:21] <+Skatedeandre> When did ff7 come out? 97?
[0:47:24] <Iam_Dead> It's not fully polygonal tho.
[0:47:27] <+LogothX> Resident Evil 2?
[0:47:28] <fruit_pie_the_magician> I was 12, it rocked my shit
[0:47:31] <hazardkujacker> FFX is important... the Spoony happened.
[0:47:32] <$GohanEgret> elmo go into loaf mode
[0:47:32] <%NooblettOfWar> MGS... Where 2 OGs interrogate someone that could be a spy.... and realize that they too... could be spies
[0:47:33] <majindusto> FLUFFLEPUFF CAT
[0:47:33] <%Soulbishop> yeah ff7 shipped as a demo on windows 95
[0:47:38] <$Sphincter_Spelunker> Paige's disparaging of FF10 is the exact same thing you pushes back on for FF4
[0:47:39] <%SuperCasualBoom> FF7 = it’s 3D so it’s the best!!!
[0:47:39] <%badchoice5> People forget how incredible FFX was at release
[0:47:43] <DraxTD> @Gespens *titus laugh*
[0:47:43] <bendatron> re 2 & 3 are some of the the ps1 games that actually hold up really well
[0:47:44] <afraidanuffin> How come Pat looks exactly like Leon?
[0:47:45] <Kaitepaints> It’s not important, like my dick #beatit
[0:47:45] <%badchoice5> and still is
[0:47:45] <Calek> don't play old MegaTen games without cheats
[0:47:49] <HanPaul> yeee Paige throwing shade on FFX
[0:47:50] <$Sphincter_Spelunker> she pushes*
[0:47:52] <+mechslayer71> I played Chrono Trigger a decade plus late, but since I was a little kid it still rocked me @angriestpat
[0:47:54] <alcors_wisdom> i can stomach anything i still play dead island and that games rough as shit
[0:47:54] <%oddslogic> 7 was the reason i got a PlayStation
[0:47:54] <Croetec> Ugh BG1 has not aged well with mechanics
[0:47:56] <Fujiwara_92> i was 5
[0:47:57] <+R0bobot> big OOFs
[0:48:00] <+st_judge> Thankfully I grew up with a GBA so my baseline is SNES and up.
[0:48:03] <zamzoph> The Witcher 1?
[0:48:04] <+LogothX> Look at the fucking cat
[0:48:05] <%crot45> Cheer100 Cheer100 whats up Pat its Lozard Wizard from Discord. Did you ever had a dumb coworker when you worked in retail? One of my coworkers touched a pan in a hot oven and asked why is it hot. shes my manager
[0:48:05] <%jimmybeegood> Front Mission 3 looks a little old but the mechanics aged well.
[0:48:09] <@SSaryn> Man, you want some BIG OOFS? SMT1.
[0:48:09] <marsano168> baldurs gate is not a stream game, it is a game you play by yourself at home lol
[0:48:11] <Psyramics> I bounced super hard off Fallout 2 multiple times
[0:48:11] <Agave_Kipper> dick twisters....that is all
[0:48:17] <%joylent_blue> that cat is perfect
[0:48:18] <%NewWillinium> Ooph. I have never gotten past chapter 3 of Baldur's Gate. It is REALLY archiac especially if you are used to newer CRPGs
[0:48:20] <Graxe_> Witcher 1's combat is still strange to me.
[0:48:23] <%DedlokPM> apatPorgmo
[0:48:25] <OkamiDude15> i may not have been born when ff7 came out but i did remember seeing my cousin playing it when i was young and i was like that looks dope as shit
[0:48:25] <%crot45> yo ssaryn
[0:48:28] <%Dmorktry> Paige, pet Elmo, you monster
[0:48:28] <KaiserMario> @SSaryn SHIT SMT1 is OOOOOFFFFF
[0:48:29] <%AbnormalVoid> fronthole mission
[0:48:29] <tUxUt> the worst thing about playing old games for me is clunky control schemes & movement
[0:48:31] <+LogothX> FF6 aged well
[0:48:31] <%joylent_blue> he's so majestic
[0:48:32] <majindusto> Sleepy Fluffy Cat
[0:48:34] <fruit_pie_the_magician> And FFX is somehow mechanically and narratively worse than all previous entries
[0:48:35] <+KanjiBestHusbando> Glad my first console was the NES so I have a better tolerance for that old jank
[0:48:38] <Fujiwara_92> front misson 1 aged well
[0:48:40] <MiraiUsagi> Tetris aged well(?)
[0:48:40] <+Cadwae> Chrono Trigger
[0:48:40] <%Dmorktry> DMC1
[0:48:40] <+Undenizen> Rayman 1
[0:48:41] <suikudo> Parasite eve aged like fine wine
[0:48:42] <Calek> @SSaryn you mean you don't want real hard encounters 2-4 times in a row every 3 steps?
[0:48:42] <SleepyMaribo> chrono trigger
[0:48:42] <Daniel_Is_I> GoldenEye aged incredibly poorly, but I can appreciate it for what it was
[0:48:43] <OwlLightningMage> I've never liked Ocarina of Time that much regardless of when I've played it
[0:48:43] <%MelBrooksKA> MGS's controls
[0:48:44] <Agave_Kipper> what are we talking about?
[0:48:44] <%thunderdutch> The remakes of old games are usually kind of depressing, but they do often make some systems better.
[0:48:45] <cheezbass> metal slug
[0:48:45] <RCtiger0> I'm trying to play Persona 2 Eternal Punishment on my PS3 after finishing Persona 5. That game is aged like milk.
[0:48:48] <marsano168> Spyro
[0:48:48] <+ajcritfumble> supreme commander forged alliance!
[0:48:49] <hazardkujacker> BG1 was so archaic because it was basically running on an Archaich version of Dungeons & Dragons
[0:48:51] <%SuperCasualBoom> Yang aged well into a skeletal remains...
[0:48:52] <%ssjklyco> Tomb Raider is probably unplayable now.
[0:48:53] <+AmericanaRed> SMASH
[0:48:53] <alcors_wisdom> talking about un-intuitive you ever play lost in the blue pat?
[0:48:54] <swordsman70> Chrono Cross
[0:48:54] <cheezbass> any old random beat em up
[0:48:55] <+RenoDeGeneric> FFX mechanically worse? atpCarl
[0:48:55] <majindusto> Chrono Trigger
[0:48:55] <%Agami23> parasite eve is just fantastic looking
[0:48:59] <suikudo> Parasite eve aged so well you did a fucking LP of it in the modern generation
[0:49:01] <%umbypokochan> i love Bust-a-Groove 2... it has good music, i swear!
[0:49:03] <Fujiwara_92> chrono trigger
[0:49:04] <+AmericanaRed> MELE
[0:49:04] <Halospaz117> How far back are we talking when we say aged well?
[0:49:07] <+Cptn_Turtle> Mario 64 kinda sucks now too
[0:49:07] <%Freelance7> That was Kingdom Hearts for me
[0:49:07] <+redanimator> devil kings the bad censored sengoku basara for ps2
[0:49:09] <%badchoice5> Aging well can be as much a function of the systems as the graphics. For instance, I still think FFX's battle system is one of the best, and totally holds up.
[0:49:10] <$psydaku> parasite eve
[0:49:12] <%TheToiletDuck2> Tetris is ageless
[0:49:12] <$Sphincter_Spelunker> @SuperCasualBoom Paige wants that though. She love the skelly
[0:49:14] <+zaworldo> so hey
[0:49:17] <%SuperCasualBoom> I still have a copy of Bust a Groove 2
[0:49:21] <OwlLightningMage> KH1 was always bad
[0:49:21] <%RogueInfinity> GoldenEye is completely unplayable now
[0:49:22] <Agave_Kipper> ff6 has aged pretty well, like a fine red wine
[0:49:23] <+zaworldo> are we ever gonna start the game?
[0:49:23] <%BDKatsumaru> Yo Bust-a-Groove was my jam back at the laundromat when I was little.
[0:49:24] <%Soulbishop> see fighting force was a big release but didn't agree well
[0:49:24] <+TinoPepino24> Vagrant story has aged well
[0:49:26] <+deity_majora> sprite based games age weell
[0:49:26] <%thunderdutch> SNES gmaes don't count
[0:49:29] <Zantetzuken> tomb raider anniversary though
[0:49:29] <fruit_pie_the_magician> Man tomb raider was just not good or fun
[0:49:30] <Grennold> Classic Tomb Raider was already borderline unplayable 20 years ago
[0:49:31] <zamzoph> Star Fox LUL
[0:49:32] <%mistymntns> Excuse me while I go play Myst again/
[0:49:32] <+Undenizen> Puzzle Bobble
[0:49:32] <+Black_Machete> I played the original PREY after feeding the new PREY and I loved it
[0:49:33] <+TDotGoat> mid-late 90s 3d games did not survive
[0:49:34] <%joylent_blue> god going back to KH1 is hell
[0:49:40] <$Sayie> I tired playing FF7 like 4 years ago and literally couldn't progress because I just couldn't figure out where to go because of the graphics being so bad
[0:49:40] <+Dustwalker44> Devil May Cry 1? Or Devil May Cry 3?
[0:49:41] <acexclover> im sorry to say but i am way to young for most of the final fantasy games
[0:49:42] <%GarbageNirvana> Low poly + no one knew how to make 3D games
[0:49:42] <+Undenizen> Puzzle bobble is the shit
[0:49:42] <%eagleclassgamer> @AngriestPat Pat that painting is scaring the shit out of me. Please hang it now. BTW you are looking more and more like David Cage every day
[0:49:42] <OkamiDude15> @zaworldo give it like half an hour
[0:49:44] <+witsull> Sarges Heroes on the 64 sucks absolute dick today OMEGALUL
[0:49:44] <Halospaz117> Ok apparently I have a HIGH tolerence for old ass games cuz I'm also giving Tomb Raider 1 a chance, so looks like I'll be fine playing RE2 original
[0:49:46] <swordsman70> As some one who grew up after most of these games, I can appreciate them but whether or not I enjoy them depend
[0:49:46] <+centrilion> early 3d does not age well
[0:49:47] <%AbnormalVoid> Banjo Kazooie still looks alright
[0:49:48] <mdkcde> parasite eve aged well, parasite eve 2... didn't
[0:49:48] <$Sphincter_Spelunker> bubsy 3d
[0:49:50] <+redanimator> bibleblack is 18 it holds up
[0:49:50] <%commanderclaw> Silent Hill 1 still looks good
[0:49:50] <Agave_Kipper> ff7 has not
[0:49:50] <marsano168> I played Xenogears for the first time THIS YEAR and that game is still mind blowing\
[0:49:50] <%axellogic> I think Megaman Legends actually aged surprisingly well
[0:49:51] <fruit_pie_the_magician> JUMPING FLASH AND WIPEOUT
[0:49:51] <+Zombiemowlcher> Legacy of Kain looks alright
[0:49:52] <hazardkujacker> What about Ridge Racer Type 4?
[0:49:54] <%Toynota10> But stuff like Mario 64 still holds up!
[0:49:55] <dagreenpillow> Megaman Legends is good O:
[0:49:56] <+purps26> SNES games still control well usually.. PS1 games control like ASS
[0:49:56] <+Skatedeandre> Dude KH 1 was TUFF for me
[0:50:02] <%Ragnarok_Flames> katamari 1 holds up super good
[0:50:03] <Kaitepaints> Haha! The cage has returned!!
[0:50:06] <+lockbreaker> wild arms 2 looks like garbage
[0:50:06] <cheezbass> wave race 64 holds up and it wasnt important
[0:50:08] <Twoiis> WC3 getting that update. Those old models aged BAAADLY.
[0:50:10] <SiegeJay> DRAGON QUEST GAMES GOT REMADE 3 times EACH
[0:50:11] <%SvenHolgersson> shut up MOM
[0:50:11] <%NewWillinium> @hazardkujacker I honestly had more of a problem with just how damned QUIET Baldur's Gate was. The companions barely ever talked to one another, they rarely if ever interjected in a conversation, and the attack animations were silly. The ADnD system is more then simple enough to overlook in comparison
[0:50:12] <Guardiansaiyan> Was in college...can confirm
[0:50:12] <$GohanEgret> s u c c
[0:50:13] <%MrBorisMakarov> doodLewd

[0:50:43] <%Toynota10> experts
[0:50:43] <%Nobody404> Dumb question but is the discord server supposed to add itself to my server list after I link my account? Or does it take a while to update after subbing?
[0:50:43] <Guardiansaiyan> @shouruKEN can't he do both?
[0:50:44] <Bouldus> the cloak of piss

[1:12:48] <+KanjiBestHusbando> Lickers were a huge wall from me playing this when I was a kid, they're too scary
[1:12:49] <%xemnahort> for a ps1 game this does look really good. the guys who modded this did great work

[1:13:13] <conflict1914> Your pistol cannot penetrate hat cloth
[1:13:16] <GrandmasterBFunk> cursed hats
[1:13:17] <@SSaryn> Hats basically have ballistic armor in the RPD
[1:13:18] <a_useless_lamp> Big hat energy
[1:13:18] <Robrime> +5 to armor
[1:13:18] <%JJCheeker> Elmo looks so comfortable. He loves that couch apatWink
[1:13:20] <%NewWillinium> Clearly their Fashion souls give them more health Pat
[1:13:22] <mrjohncarlton> Those hats give a +4 to Defense
[1:13:25] <+twohitgood> everything back then ran off of key cards....now my modern life also runs off of key cards. should i feel threatened that my key card has a higher access than most? clearly some hero will come along later and need my access.
[1:13:30] <+Surf_Zombie> Girl guns HotPokket
[1:13:33] <+pleasenameyourcharacter> Hats are strong agains ballistic, but weak to energy.

[1:51:48] <+PaiRho> Mybad
[1:51:48] <%Soulbishop> well i mean fuck Leon
[1:51:53] <Graxe_> But you can use the submachine gun. Just not the one with infinite ammo.
[1:51:56] <tUxUt> pat is wearing socks :)
[1:52:03] <heatrashes> elmo is so comfy
[1:52:04] <+around_40_jobbers> what about Leon C?

[1:52:20] <+R0bobot> Oh no, watch out for zombie gorillaz in that garage!
[1:52:21] <$SGrim> @AngriestPat the grenade launcher obviously has a ammo tube designed by mobius. Duh. rooDerp
[1:52:22] <breadwoof> @tank7013 are you telling me pat could be incorrect
[1:52:24] <Fujiwara_92> dmc logic
[1:52:28] <knomad2b> cause those are for babies
[1:52:28] <%SaltyDongs> Not the dogsssss

[1:52:45] <wolf_hurricane> Be honest guys. Would any of you *NOT* knock up the president's daughter? LUL
[1:52:48] <%joylent_blue> you must style on these zombies with your handgun, NOT a SMG
[1:52:49] <majindusto> Pupper Snuffer
[1:52:51] <$MightyMaxT> So how does the Zapping match up? Is it Leon A/Claire B & Leon B/Claire A or Leon A/Claire A & Leon B/Claire B?
[1:52:52] <tank7013> @breadwoof I might be hinting towards that yes. Shocking I know
[1:52:54] <+VanaSkiller> Snuff those puppers
[1:53:00] <%Soulbishop> does thay apply to mixing and using super herb?
[1:53:03] <thegreenbenis> I would probably knock up the Presidents daughter.
[1:53:04] <nina9669> bark stoppers
[1:53:04] <%Nekemancer> Elmo is being such a good boy

[1:53:19] <alcors_wisdom> the dankest of herbs
[1:53:20] <Tampaoster> SMOKE WEED ERRYDAY
[1:53:26] <Tampaoster> JUST ROLL IT UP
[1:53:27] <alcors_wisdom> canada knows all about that now
[1:53:28] <Graxe_> But there's so much ammo in the game that you don't need the submachine gun anyway.
[1:53:30] <+Zombiemowlcher> @DrWolpertinger Are there any monsters that don't relate to James being sad and horny?
[1:53:30] <%legendscar01> Yeah! oh bow gun......bolts
[1:53:30] <SulfurousAcid> how does she know who Ben is?
[1:53:31] <%THATGUY_789> i just picture them just eating it like a sheep
[1:53:37] <Renuarb> Ben sucks. The hell was his plan anyway? Sit in a jailcell for the rest of his life?
[1:53:39] <+DrWolpertinger> @guardiansaiyan dunno if you replied to me, left chat for a second.
[1:53:39] <Tampaoster> those brown herbs
[1:53:41] <%badchoice5> I just realized the ranking system in DmC is probably because of the ranking system in these games
[1:53:42] <Luesagna00> does mixing the blue herb increase healing??
[1:53:45] <%legendscar01> And dogs I believe
[1:53:46] <alcors_wisdom> pat blazing it every day like a true gamer
[1:53:52] <+pleasenameyourcharacter> if I cook the zombie dogs, like cook the ABSOLUTE SHIT out of them, burn the hell out of em, does that kill the virus and make the meat harmless? hypothetically of course...
[1:53:55] <breadwoof> cornered by dogs NotLikeThis
[1:53:59] <%xemnahort> the reason why first aid sprays lower your ranking is beacuase at the end when talking about what happened when people learn you used them they laugh at you
[1:54:02] <%joylent_blue> lobosS
[1:54:03] <%Soulbishop> i think everyone didn't have a plan
[1:54:07] <majindusto> In Canada, we love the Green Herb
[1:54:08] <%badchoice5> This game is why items hurt your ranking in stylish action games
[1:54:08] <Tampaoster> oof
[1:54:11] <Kalcom> dogggo flash kicks
[1:54:12] <Grennold> Dogs are the fucking worst. Worse than lickers IMO
[1:54:19] <+DrWolpertinger> @zombiemowlcher if memory serves
[1:54:25] <izaich> are those doggos police doggos gone crazy?
[1:54:27] <%Agami23> do you still need to fight the cockroach tube as sherry in claire B?
[1:54:30] <+Tylermcd93> @Grennold In game or out of game? Kappa
[1:54:31] <%THATGUY_789> hounddoom used Bite
[1:54:31] <wanacoba> Hey Pat! How do you think REmake 2 will handle switching from Leon to Claire?
[1:54:33] <+Zombiemowlcher> Here's these super good healing items player, but you're a BITCH if you use them
[1:54:36] <%joylent_blue> first aid sprays were the original Gold Orbs
[1:54:37] <+DrWolpertinger> @zombiemowlcher no
[1:54:37] <a_useless_lamp> Healing items? You mean a RUINED RANK?!?
[1:54:38] <tUxUt> how is canada's herb situation? is it back in stock yet?
[1:54:44] <+Undenizen> shhh. kitty is sleeping.
[1:54:45] <Guardiansaiyan> @DrWolpertinger I did reply but its really far back
[1:54:45] <TafferAA> I hope instead of just doing that stupid kick the dogs actually rip the fuck out of your arm or something
[1:54:53] <alcors_wisdom> probs not the way the virus works the cells become infected argo changing their innate nature meaning that no matter what the meat would always be corrupted
[1:55:03] <+Zombiemowlcher> @DrWolpertinger The bugs are bugs tho right?
[1:55:06] <Grennold> @Tylermcd93 Both 4Head
[1:55:12] <%Soulbishop> jeez i wouldn't leave the save room without a first aid in my inventory
[1:55:12] <+pleasenameyourcharacter> dang... that's a bummer.
[1:55:15] <izaich> door polishing simulator
[1:55:16] <Graxe_> I keep reading that you can use a maximum of one first aid spray before it lowers your rank.
[1:55:16] <Worldbrand> a desperate piss
[1:55:17] <MiraiUsagi> dogs are the worse because of how shooting works on this game, and how much they move
[1:55:20] <%legendscar01> Whats your quickest time pat for this game?
[1:55:20] <Fujiwara_92> leave? DansGame
[1:55:20] <%thunderdutch> get a catheter

[2:04:53] <wolf_hurricane> @AngriestPat is it normal to find RE4's aiming frustrating and difficult, so much so I dropped the game partially over it?

[2:04:56] <$MightyMaxT> Alright Chat. I'm working on a Photoshop assignment for class. Should I give a Giant Bird Human Hands or a Human Face?

[2:07:21] <%legendscar01> No wolf Claire A is canon and Leon B

[2:45:10] <KaiserMario> @AngriestPat Isn't this the place where she fights Byrkin in the Remake trailers?
[2:45:16] <%Soulbishop> nah it runs in the redfield family
[2:45:18] <%badchoice5> @thunderdutch Pat knows every file in this game by heart
[2:45:31] <%thunderdutch> I would go to a show for a band called Zombie Murder Stripper.
[2:45:47] <%legendscar01> all true re2 fans know every file by heart dawg
[2:45:53] <%thunderdutch> Gasp! Pat kinda called me out.
[2:45:56] <+Zombiemowlcher> REmake looks so goddamn chunky, I love it
[2:45:56] <tungstenviper> I't sa sort of Boiler room under the station
[2:45:58] <+king_wragles> Zombie Murder Stripper sounds like a good comic title/series
[2:45:58] <alcors_wisdom> i would go to a show called zombie strippers period
[2:46:00] <a_useless_lamp> Not picking up files should hurt your ranking
[2:46:01] <+trnzero> @AngriestPat What's your biggest fear concerning the Remake
[2:46:10] <%joylent_blue> he's ignored us telling him to pick up files better than he ignored Matt when he did it
[2:46:10] <%Keyd00d> did he just say heil
[2:46:13] <+witsull> Aww
[2:46:17] <OwlLightningMage> Orgy zombies
[2:46:21] <alcors_wisdom> their nudity makes them burn better
[2:46:22] <+witsull> LUL
[2:46:23] <theshockvox> So this is the zapping system, eh? Kinda shitty. I mean, how come we don’t see Leon’s footprints in every location he’s been in, or see the spot where he left his gum? Sonic Adventure had a better Zapping system......why am I trying to trigger a man who won’t even read this? I need to clean my room or something else productive.
[2:46:23] <%jiin6> LUL
[2:46:25] <gyrogogozeppeli> Stream over
[2:46:25] <wired_soul> do not fuck the naked zombies !!! very dieseasee !!
[2:46:29] <+Demerson13> Remember when Pat died here in the RE2 LP?
[2:46:30] <TafferAA> you think the naked zombies will have visible junk in the remake? 🤔
[2:46:30] <+Demerson13> I do
[2:46:30] <%joylent_blue> oh yeah pat died in this room in the LP
[2:46:31] <%badchoice5> Are we coming up on the part where Pat died in the LP?
[2:46:31] <%jonesyboy_19> I hope the flesh out the lab abit more in Remake like whats with the massive caverns and sewage entrances
[2:46:33] <Guardiansaiyan> A CHRISTIAN STREAM?!
[2:46:34] <%legendscar01> This is where you died pat on the lp
[2:46:36] <Neo_Kaiser> Didn't these guys kill Pat in the past?
[2:46:38] <+redstonej> GOT EM'
[2:46:40] <1101Archimedes> I would need to see some reviews before going to a show called Zombie Strippers. Don't want to get ripped off.
[2:46:41] <bsmusic> hmm, chat's more chill than usual
[2:46:42] <Guardiansaiyan> Where are Elmos presents PAT?!

[2:46:51] <%jiin6> why isn't there Leon hair all over the floor
[2:47:00] <a_useless_lamp> "You don't need to go to Resident Evil 2"
[2:47:07] <MiraiUsagi> @SuperCasualBoom then i'm a stripper?
[2:47:07] <%thunderdutch> You have to be dead outside to be a Zombie.
[2:47:10] <%joylent_blue> i'm glad chat remembered the death here
[2:47:11] <alcors_wisdom> @SuperCasualBoom arent we all zombies on the inside
[2:47:17] <theshockvox> @happyface699 Can’t....it’s no fap November or something
[2:47:25] <$GohanEgret> the death was great because pat didn't save
[2:47:26] <MiraiUsagi> Arent we are strippers on the inside?

[2:49:03] <%jimmybeegood> everyone talking about Parasite Eve but not enough talk about how Koudelka ate this style and came up with something else entirely
[2:49:09] <%jimmybeegood> it's a strange dichotomy
[2:49:09] <alcors_wisdom> cant wait for the parasite eve third birthday playthrough @AngriestPat

[2:51:33] <%legendscar01> GIANT PLANT VAGINA
[2:51:39] <theshockvox> @happyface699 S’not even bad man. It’s not brilliant or spectacular and too many people are comparing it to Berserk, but not even it’s trying to be Berserk. It’s kinda anime schlock, in a good way.
[2:51:41] <alcors_wisdom> @jokisilent the timer is in your heart
[2:51:44] <vectorcannonready> You can fight Midocondria enemies in World of FF, as well as secret Xenogears boss.

[3:40:57] <MrDonTacos_> KIRBY the God Slayer
[3:40:58] <masterkazzugos> Waluigi's final smash is him taking his removed foreskin and slapping the player with it

[3:53:24] <+thedannydarko> Woolie will gain his own new racism toward the al bhed
[3:53:27] <%badchoice5> Wait is Paige gonna be signing butts?
[3:53:37] <%Remery_> 7 hours to feel Pat's boobs
[3:53:41] <Logan_Jennings1> It's because of Paiges big ol.... Muscles.

[3:54:37] <+SparkAfterDark> How many wombs has she signed
[3:54:43] <$Gimbus> KH1 has a much better story because it was before it got dumb, the jumping and camera controls make it so annoying to play for me.

[3:54:46] <@thenefftw> Go away, Geno
