[0:15:10] <dapperskeleton69> PAT WILL NEVER BEAT DIVINITY
[0:15:12] <%RubberFistFight> @AngriestPat nah you can sustain hairline fractures to several bones in your feet and not lose functionality. If you straight-up snapped your heelbone off or something you'd be incapable of walking, but a relatively-contained fracture will only be super unpleasant to walk on.

Helped me remember where I was and needed to do. Was helpful in knowing what to do for the lab area. (saved before final Lisa encounter cause life got in the way) Made me think back to when I stopped playing it for 2 weeks to get greeted by the Hunter I ran from into the safe room. Gave me quite the spooks when I started it back up.

[0:26:42] <heart_ablaze> that's actually heart warming
[0:26:43] <%rumtumtugnutz> I had social anxiety until I got into theatre stuff in school. In one play I was a background character and I tripped and fucked up the set. Everyone laughed, I felt embarassed, but I wasn't anxious anymore.
[0:26:44] <%lovebass4stuff> Where did you go to college?
[0:26:44] <%doc_ock_rokc> Leather what
[0:26:45] <%GabeSweetMan> @goose_attack_almanac That's awful. Thank you for this gift.
[0:26:45] <%CJett92> CJett92 subscribed at Tier 1. They've subscribed for 20 months! A couple of stoners moved into the apartment right next to mine and it's making MY apartment reek of weed all day now, what do?
[0:26:48] <BallinArbiter> This is super wholesome
[0:26:54] <+wjones0415> my fanfiction was true!
[0:27:00] <Daebunz> i used to also be a socially anxious nightmare but i sort of just... stopped caring and it worked out pretty great. I stream periodically now just as a way to get further enjoyment out of stuff id already be playing
[0:27:00] <%WackyGear> @AngriestPat I hope you've just created Pat X fuggins factions now
[0:27:00] <%xeros720> you tell your landlord
[0:27:01] <ohgodscorpions> and woolie said his favorite was street fighter and you walked away slowly
[0:27:02] <+Yakobro> more like 3
[0:27:04] <dukenux> @CJett92 ask them if they like videogams
[0:27:07] <+SlickRick11211> did he just start?

[0:27:21] <redrins> watch it be eureka
[0:27:22] <Cranky_Construct> Best way to cure social anxiety is try joining an anime club and finding that you're way better off than you think you are
[0:27:22] <%Animorphimagi> Nier?
[0:27:23] <+enternius> I really just want to see what the new Eden fights are. The framework they had for the first 4 is so strange

[0:28:21] <%Aydarkzero> how old is Tensei?
[0:28:21] <%Ranryu692> @AngriestPat the Rick and Morty mobile game Pocket Mortys is JUST pokemon
[0:28:21] <%D3rrtyD4n> they dont own the genre
[0:28:22] <%xeros720> yeah, pokeballs are kind of a tipping point though
[0:28:23] <Cigwynn> Digimon games exist too
[0:28:24] <%maskofmichael> And Digimon too
[0:28:24] <dukenux> And Digimon
[0:28:25] <+sizableidiot> people have such a massive circlejerk over this. if this was the case doom would be the only FPS
[0:28:26] <ElenaManetta> Pokemon was only recently like this in terms of visual presentation in Sword/Shield
[0:28:27] <%xeros720> so avoid those and you're good
[0:28:29] <%Pappajimbo> invented by romans using lions and christians
[0:28:29] <%TenguGemini> hell, DQ5 exists
[0:28:30] <+Ilpala> True, BUT TemTem is not hiding how MUCH of pokemon systems and formulas it is ripping off
[0:28:30] <keiji_maede> DIGIMON
[0:28:31] <+Jontman42> also people do that in real life
[0:28:32] <JetpackMcQuack> Since dogs were invented
[0:28:32] <%bluebiscuit94> There's also an OLD japanese phone game that did it

[0:28:36] <worldbrand> also you cant really own mechanics unless you're namco
[0:28:36] <%yourliteraldog> POKEMON DOES NOT OWN DOGFIGHTING
[0:28:36] <Calek> @Aydarkzero 1986 or 87
[0:28:38] <%Faustgesicht> Also dogfighting and cockfighting have been around a while
[0:28:38] <keiji_maede> DIGIMON.....T.T
[0:28:39] <powerprotoman> this biggest problem is temtem sounds like an insult and not the actual name
[0:28:39] <buffmurffy> pokemon can sue everyone for using rael pets
[0:28:40] <%doc_ock_rokc> @EndlessScrapper Yeah the guy below me smokes daily, the hallway is like perminately skunk but thank god my appartment is okay

[0:48:38] <NickHatesSnow> It was Apollo
[0:48:39] <Cigwynn> This is my legally distinct Tempedia, NOT POKEDEX
[0:48:39] <+wjones0415> yep
[0:48:41] <BaronVonMagpie> that is in fact where the pokemon professors came from
[0:48:42] <thepowerofpinsol> what are the starters? Are they shiny locked?
[0:48:42] <%UncleAWOL> "Didn't Zeus chase that broad..." is the start of every greek story
[0:48:42] <Sol_Install> oh ye
[0:48:43] <+penndra> BIG LORE vargMAMA
[0:48:43] <+MisterCrimson> I mean, most of the professors definitely want to fuck pokemon

[1:17:09] <%wydamn> I like this battle music
[1:17:10] <+VektorTroika> it's like it was actually animated
[1:17:10] <KaliasTV> You're Gemlo IV but we'll just call you Gemlo so we can reuse the food bowl and forget this all happened
[1:17:11] <tegas_> Uhh
[1:17:11] <DuoScratch> the music's a bit lame for a battle theme.
[1:17:12] <%Agami23> it looks like pokemon and slime rancher got combined

[1:17:22] <try_it_sis_> the art suck ass, but the visual are amazing
[1:17:22] <%GeneralSCPatton> @angriestpat According to time ethics, the other Gemlos never existed. This is the first and only Gemlo.
[1:17:26] <ElenaManetta> Everyone who has reviewed the game said they dont like the character designs and I think they're nice.
[1:17:26] <tegas_> I think the animations are very basic, but look nice because high framerate.
[1:17:27] <jorniev> 3 gemlos and and a black kid died for this
[1:17:30] <Vileosis> yeah the characters are the worst for sure

[1:38:04] <%Grayhammatter> switching temtem?
[1:38:06] <%Roundelay11> ALL GIRLS
[1:38:06] <$rooooooooooot> thats awful
[1:38:11] <%Laecerelius> It doesn't have EVs and IVs, it has SVs and TVs
[1:38:19] <dapperskeleton69> xpshare is for babies
[1:38:21] <%Laecerelius> So yeah it does
[1:38:22] <+Kise77> @AngriestPat there is a xp share
[1:38:24] <%bevyrage> damn TVs ruinin' the generation
[1:38:25] <%Ranryu692> but other games have EVs and IVs
[1:38:27] <TioXyco> but there is a exp share
[1:38:27] <$QueequegTheater> @Laecerelius But do they fulfill the same function?
[1:38:29] <$rooooooooooot> it should have exp share
[1:38:29] <%Louie_Salmon> I mean that would still be nice
[1:38:30] <+Kise77> It's called a Cowards Claok @AngriestPat
[1:38:31] <TioXyco> so a third one can get exp
[1:38:31] <$joylent_blue> yeah just don't get your baby killed
[1:38:32] <foreverN2dust> @Laecerelius oh god no
[1:38:32] <haisho> not enough AP
[1:38:32] <%ultimatetotoro> @laecerelius seriously?
[1:38:32] <DagetStreams> Ah man, your're gonna lose it when I tell you about Pokemon Colosseum then
[1:38:32] <+donpatrondx> weird how Pokemon is 1v1 but competitive is 2v2
[1:38:32] <Cranky_Construct> Its got a warm up on it
[1:38:35] <%bevyrage> pat you can totally use it
[1:38:36] <%rumtumtugnutz> @Laecerelius I have a TV
[1:38:36] <%Gadur26> its A TURN 2 MOVE
[1:38:37] <tegas_> Newest Pokemon has no EXP share, so it's like every other JRPG now.
[1:38:40] <+ReiDuran> Does the music sound off key to anyone else?
[1:38:40] <Cranky_Construct> The number of lines on the move name is how many turns it takes to charge
[1:38:41] <meowarco> Need to charge
[1:38:41] <%PlainSimpleTailor> CRAZY TALK
[1:38:43] <%Laecerelius> I'm assuming they're the same
[1:38:47] <%TendrilsTwitch> is there a battle speed up?
[1:38:50] <%Gadur26> look at pips on move to see what turn
[1:38:52] <powerprotoman> "you dont need an exp share" "there is one" swing and a miss
[1:38:53] <%Grayhammatter> those bars are how long it takes to charge
[1:38:58] <%MoralCompassGaming> I wonder if this will come out on Switch? Kappa
[1:38:59] <+pectusumbra> alright, up too late as is, good night
[1:39:00] <tegas_> Dear god
[1:39:02] <KoopaPrez> how is Pat liking the game?
[1:39:02] <+BKNPham> can someone please explain stumbeak's name
[1:39:04] <Matoryis> yoooooo
[1:39:04] <%Louie_Salmon> Wait there's moves you straight up can't do on turn one?
[1:39:04] <tegas_> That's a good one
[1:39:06] <%Laecerelius> His birb has a bunch of numbers under his SVs but all 0's for his TVs
[1:39:07] <%maskofmichael> That's a good move
[1:39:08] <+2DSuperiority> Remeber the Owlmo
[1:39:08] <Oxybe> is it a forced xp share?
[1:39:09] <%Gadur26> yes
[1:39:09] <%yourliteraldog> So you not pokes build meter rather than having stamina
[1:39:22] <%Kiiper> @BKNPham Stumbo with a beak
[1:39:23] <+BubbaRands> Some moves have cool down
[1:39:24] <%Gadur26> also uses stamin
[1:39:25] <Cranky_Construct> Basically yeah
[1:39:26] <DSD24> Stum Beak is pretty cute
[1:39:26] <+Kise77> Also you get less XP if you have two Tem's I think 5 level higher than the rest? @AngriestPat so the Cowards Cloak XP share is handy
[1:39:32] <$QuesoFM> The exp share is called the cowards cloak
[1:39:35] <lethallylactic> I think Taterz gets an attackming move at level 4.
[1:39:35] <%goose_attack_almanac> @BKNPham Pat started saying Stumbo once because Stupid Dumbo or... something like that. And also that bird has a beak
[1:39:36] <%doc_ock_rokc> @BKNPham Stubmo
[1:39:37] <Cranky_Construct> Moves have warmup timers on them, but also everything's governed by the stamina system
[1:39:37] <%Faustgesicht> @BKNPham Stumbo + Beak
[1:39:45] <%Laecerelius> and some of the SV numbers were green so that might be the max or something
[1:39:46] <+BKNPham> ah thanks guys
[1:39:47] <Cranky_Construct> if you go below 0 you take damage and can KO yourself from overexert
[1:39:52] <$QueequegTheater> @AngriestPat You said the artstyle is worse than Pokemon but every tem I've seen looks fucking adorable
[1:39:53] <%wolfofsound> the real questions is are there waifus?
[1:39:54] <%GeneralSCPatton> @bknpham Pat has been referred to as Stumby or Stumbo, a portmanteau of stumble and stumpy
[1:39:56] <DSD24> @Cranky_Construct Hi Cranky!
[1:39:57] <$insaneintentionsyo> so is this fun?
[1:40:00] <%Fdrank> channel points
[1:40:01] <Cranky_Construct> hey @DSD24
[1:40:01] <%Engwithan_Elder_God> This is pretty neat.
[1:40:04] <ohgodscorpions> there's no satisfying ping when you level up
[1:40:10] <dapperskeleton69> @fdrank nice
[1:40:10] <$joylent_blue> i'll get it when it comes to switch probs
[1:40:13] <tegas_> Pat skipped the latest Pokemon right?
[1:40:14] <FstSergeant8595> @QueequegTheater He was tlaking about the character models
[1:40:16] <+BKNPham> almost as if anyone can do the pokemon formula better
[1:40:16] <$rooooooooooot> what does this game have over pokemon cus right now i aint seein it
[1:40:20] <Shatterthought> the good news is that can always be added. :D @ohgodscorpions
[1:40:21] <dredshift> Sword and Shield give a good first impression too. Then the rest of the game happens.
[1:40:24] <infinitey> This game has so much cool shit in it and you haven't even scratched the surface yet
[1:40:25] <+sinistersally> Looks better than sword and shield at least
[1:40:26] <tegas_> Me too
[1:40:32] <foreverN2dust> you didn't miss anything
[1:40:33] <%Zulrez> oh hey you can see your temtems in the bottom right corner when walking around
[1:40:36] <%BayowolfTerra> More fun than pokemon heard it hear folks!
[1:40:39] <%CommanderSqueaks> Oof
[1:40:39] <%LiveStreamOnyx> @rooooooooooot it‚Äôs an mmo?
[1:40:40] <%Roundelay11> yeah, this just look another pokemon clone
[1:40:45] <%BallerSwagBro9k> SAME
[1:40:45] <%yourliteraldog> But is there a curry minigame?
[1:40:46] <$insaneintentionsyo> wow
[1:40:47] <%JojoPiero> Last one I beat was Leafgreen
[1:40:47] <+Razor4145> is it always a double battle
[1:40:50] <DSD24> I liked Diamond and Pearl
[1:40:51] <Ipsenscastle> Diamond and Pearl were excellent
[1:40:52] <NeroCapone> platinum gang HERE
[1:40:53] <warmnoid> sinnoh is comfy
[1:40:53] <KazMkII> Yikes. You missed out on Platinum
[1:40:54] <$joylent_blue> gen 4 was good
[1:40:55] <tegas_> I skip all of the remakes/remasters and stick to the new stuff.
[1:40:55] <KoopaPrez> How is Pat liking the game?
[1:40:55] <Shatterthought> @Zulrez and if you're on PC you can click and drag to rearrange party/battle order without going into menu there too.
[1:40:57] <%VioletHeart> I was fairly unimpressed with the stress test but that might just be the early game. Didn't have enough time to see it do anything particularly interesting.
[1:40:57] <+sinistersally> @AngriestPat that was the pinnacle
[1:40:59] <dapperskeleton69> but does it have WALKING YOUR POKEMON
[1:40:59] <Quietshun13> gen 4 and 5 best
[1:41:00] <%BallerSwagBro9k> Diamond for me
[1:41:00] <%GarbageNirvana> It's always doubles it looks like, yeah
[1:41:00] <%Jack_of_No_Trades> red, crystal, soul silver for me
[1:41:00] <Ner234> The last Pokemon I beat was the orignal Ruby LUL
[1:41:01] <Kalcom> platinum was perfect
[1:41:01] <$QueequegTheater> @AngriestPat If you have a DS emulator working give Black and White a try some time, Gen 5 was great
[1:41:02] <+threamstream> Pokemon fans salty af about this game
[1:41:03] <%rumtumtugnutz> @Razor4145 Yes
[1:41:07] <$insaneintentionsyo> Black 2 White 2 ‚ù§Ô∏è
[1:41:08] <lethallylactic> Level 4
[1:41:08] <Kalcom> pearl is weird
[1:41:08] <@ShockzNDrawe> This shits in early access and it still looks more finished than sword and shield
[1:41:10] <$joylent_blue> KoopaPrez he says its made a really good first impression
[1:41:10] <$rooooooooooot> @LiveStreamOnyx that doesnt make it better
[1:41:10] <%CommanderSqueaks> @Roundelay11 It's a Pokemon clone that looks like it's doing everything Pokemon did just significantly better.
[1:41:12] <NeroCapone> Platinum is easily the best pokemon gang fight me!
[1:41:12] <worldbrand> to be honest this is just reminding me of how much i dont care for pokemon gameplay
[1:41:13] <%Sogeki_Dan> When is Temtem Go?
[1:41:13] <+BubbaRands> Black and White was okay. Everything after doesnt matter
[1:41:16] <chrismij57> I honestly got BORED of Sword by the 4th gym. I feel bad since I love the series since Yellow but the quality just hasn't advanced...
[1:41:20] <meowarco> It was my heavy hitter for a good chunk
[1:41:22] <AFewGoodTaters> POISON POISON SpinToWin
[1:41:22] <tegas_> Pokemon fans are too busy being salty about Pokemon.
[1:41:27] <masterfire23> are there evolutions?
[1:41:28] <+killa_khronic420> killa_khronic420 subscribed with Twitch Prime. 
[1:41:33] <%rumtumtugnutz> Yes
[1:41:36] <$QueequegTheater> Toriyama wanted to end Pokemon at Gen 5
[1:41:37] <KoopaPrez> i love Sword and Shield myself. Near 300 hours.
[1:41:37] <%Grayhammatter> there are evolutions
[1:41:37] <@ShockzNDrawe> I want a platypet
[1:41:42] <lethallylactic> Yes, though not all of them are in the game yet.
[1:41:45] <@ShockzNDrawe> I want a Platypet
[1:41:46] <Oxybe> I'm all for 3rd parties styling on gamecheap
[1:41:50] <%MoralCompassGaming> sword and shield actually don't look awful. bad for our time yes but not awful.
[1:41:52] <@ShockzNDrawe> give Platypet
[1:41:52] <%Laecerelius> Taterz can now fight back!
[1:41:53] <foreverN2dust> DJ type pokemon PogChamp
[1:41:55] <tegas_> It would be good for Pokemon to have a solid competitor for sure.
[1:41:55] <Tersalus> this game has been a long time coming...pokemon cant hold on forever
[1:41:55] <DSD24> We need a level up DING
[1:41:56] <nathorz1> Pokemon fans are playing temtem LUL
[1:41:59] <Kalcom> I like how they have a fakemon
[1:42:11] <%rumtumtugnutz> I like Sword. I had a lot of fun. I don't think this looks better, but it has its own charm.
[1:42:11] <FstSergeant8595> I mean I play Pokemon Shield and im perfectly fine with Shield. It not having every Pokemon doesnt make it not an enjoyable game
[1:42:14] <chrismij57> Yokai Watch I think made GF worry a bit, right??
[1:42:17] <%BayowolfTerra> Grind box
[1:42:27] <+BubbaRands> okay that was cute...
[1:42:32] <zayasu> yokai watch LUL
[1:42:33] <$insaneintentionsyo> I like YW
[1:42:34] <KoopaPrez> @chrismij57 they def looked at YW
[1:42:36] <Shatterthought> @FstSergeant8595 the game has plenty of other problems though
[1:42:36] <%xxinevitablexii> his feets!
[1:42:41] <%xeros720> yeah, yokai watch was probably what got gamefreak to jump to 3d before they were ready
[1:42:41] <KoopaPrez> they copied the watch haha
[1:42:47] <%Laecerelius> That Taterz doesn't even have an attack! point at it and laugh!
[1:42:51] <+the_krypto_knight> a lot of the names just seem to be mispelled words from other languages. Though I guess pokemon does that too lol
[1:42:51] <%jemeralddragoon> @chrismij57 why would your girlfriend worry?
[1:42:51] <%Darren716> Theyre the same as pokemons animations
[1:42:52] <A_Windmill> High Quality Animations Kappa
[1:42:55] <$QueequegTheater> The real problem with post-DS era Pokemon is I can't speed up the emulator to get through the grinding in ORAS/S&M/X&Y like I can the first 5 gens
[1:42:57] <$QueequegTheater> Kappa
[1:42:57] <%yourliteraldog> ITS GOT FLOOPY EARS
[1:43:00] <tegas_> As much bad press as there has been regarding the removal of the pokemon import feature the game sold like crazy.
[1:43:01] <+2DSuperiority> Yokai Watch doesn't even play like Pokemon it's just monster collecting
[1:43:04] <+wjones0415> careful pat, your inner mike vic is coming out!
[1:43:04] <%Louie_Salmon> The biggest IP in all of videogames, and one of the biggest in all of media, should be so much better than "Not bad" and "perfectly fine"
[1:43:04] <%MoralCompassGaming> I just disagree with the value of the trade offs for what we gained.
[1:43:07] <$rooooooooooot> the animations are pretty run of the mill
[1:43:07] <Murphio_GS> You enjoying your pokemon Pat?
[1:43:14] <tanarath> But Pat, custom animation HARD!
[1:43:20] <%Laecerelius> DOUBLE BATTLE!!!!
[1:43:20] <+BubbaRands> double team Kreygasm
[1:43:21] <%Grayhammatter> double battle motherfucker
[1:43:22] <$rooooooooooot> im sure theyll get better though
[1:43:23] <+D00msDayDan> oh god i read his name as orphan
[1:43:28] <%jemeralddragoon> SPIT ROAST!
[1:43:31] <foreverN2dust> @FstSergeant8595 that was the fan longstanding fans of the games had issue with, the vast community that are playing temtem now are the ones that had issues with the stagnant gameplay
[1:43:32] <DSD24> Orphhan of Kos
[1:43:34] <FstSergeant8595> @Shatterthought I don't notice any problems in it. If you're tlaking about the animations I could care less.
[1:43:35] <$QueequegTheater> @Louie_Salmon Not one of. The. Pokemon is LITERALLY the most profitable IP in human history by a massive margin
[1:43:39] <$Kenzo2000> Sent to die
[1:43:44] <+Doppio1089> I am sure TemTem will be the Pokemon killer just like how Yokai Watch is, oh wait. . . PokGengar PokGengar PokGengar PokGengar
[1:43:49] <$rooooooooooot> i do like that this is all double battle all the time
[1:43:50] <A_Windmill> it's not the most profitable, it's the highest grossing. Big difference
[1:43:52] <+2DSuperiority> Mod to replace Tateru with Tataru
[1:43:54] <%Hilleltaco> how could you possibly defeat this apatSmug
[1:43:55] <tegas_> There's room for Temtem and pokemon.
[1:43:57] <%xeros720> truthfully, yokai watch is probably only comparable with merchandising and anime, its anime was really popular for a while
[1:44:00] <$insaneintentionsyo> what about orphan of Kos?
[1:44:00] <foreverN2dust> @FstSergeant8595 I can't type for shit btw
[1:44:02] <%EndlessScrapper> EndlessScrapper subscribed at Tier 1. 
[1:44:06] <+swish20XX> Yokai is very different though
[1:44:08] <tegas_> POkemon games take at least a year to come out.
[1:44:09] <Shatterthought> @FstSergeant8595 more like how you could faceroll through it and be overleveled without really trying. And how you don't face full teams until like.. the end of the game
[1:44:10] <PerfectAsymmetry> sweet violin music
[1:44:12] <%Grayhammatter> swap in owlmo?
[1:44:16] <%VioletHeart> I'm kind of sad Spectrobes didn't catch on. It was a pretty fun Pokemon-style game.
[1:44:18] <%xeros720> of course, everyone knows pokemon overtook it later, but that must've been a tense year or two
[1:44:19] <%Engwithan_Elder_God> WAT
[1:44:20] <%rumtumtugnutz> Yokai Watch is like getting waterboarded.
[1:44:22] <TioXyco> oh yeah, not sure if you already got told this, but you can go through the main story coop'ing the whole time
[1:44:24] <+JackDemon316> jeez the music is going in
[1:44:25] <DSD24> @insaneintentionsyo I read that guys name as Orphan so I just thought of Orphan of Kos randomly
[1:44:30] <$insaneintentionsyo> ah
[1:44:31] <worldbrand> @Shatterthought that's true of like the last three games
[1:44:32] <$rooooooooooot> @VioletHeart spectrobes moon2POGGYWOGGY
[1:44:41] <%AmericanaRed> apatCrazyhand apatBougie
[1:44:44] <%Stevennapalm> I'm happy for temtem getting hype, but for some reason I just can't seem to care despite being a pokemon mark
[1:44:45] <FstSergeant8595> @Shatterthought I wont argue there. The game is super easy but tbf they all are
[1:44:48] <+UltraViolet371> the music's really good
[1:44:57] <Saltmeisterr> somebody say spectrobes?
[1:44:58] <$QueequegTheater> @A_Windmill ANd in this case I seriously doubt there is a difference. #2 is ten billion dollars less
[1:45:03] <%bevyrage> @Stevennapalm it's likely because it's not pokemon
[1:45:04] <Shatterthought> @FstSergeant8595 this game throws full teams at you before the first gym/dojo
[1:45:05] <KoopaPrez> love the strings in the music
[1:45:05] <Zaphire_Saucypants> Music IS great, I'll give it that
[1:45:07] <%xeros720> ahahah, i forgot about fuckin spectrobes
[1:45:10] <Saltmeisterr> I had that game
[1:45:13] <%xeros720> i was curious if the wii game was good
[1:45:13] <RDknight> it you take off the "lm" of owlmo it becomes Owo
[1:45:14] <$insaneintentionsyo> YW has great humor, a cute anime, and a different play style that's fun

[1:45:36] <%jemeralddragoon> @Stevennapalm i feel like that's because people won't let it be its own game and keep calling it a "pokemon killer"

[1:45:44] <%GeneralSCPatton> Was it her BIG pepis?
[1:45:46] <%VioletHeart> @Stevennapalm I'm the same, don't worry. I was optimistic about Temtem but came off of it feeling pretty underwhelmed. What I played wasn't bad, but it just didn't do anything exciting.
[1:45:50] <$rooooooooooot> they DIED forsenWeird
[1:45:51] <$floralkami> Damn. taterz
[1:45:52] <thelonechris> Attack
[1:45:52] <%CommanderSqueaks> @insaneintentionsyo The biggest problem is they marketed it internationally as a Pokemon clone so that's what everyone thanks Yokai Watch is.
[1:45:53] <worldbrand> I don't actually know what you mean
[1:45:54] <%Engwithan_Elder_God> Wear their skins
[1:45:55] <%yourliteraldog> Stop looking at girl's nudes and play this childrens game like a real man.
[1:45:57] <+2DSuperiority> New Yokai Watch series is an action school sentai mech series, Pokemon is never going to do that.
[1:45:58] <Shatterthought> @jemeralddragoon I wish people would stop calling that, there's room to co-exist

[1:48:11] <foreverN2dust> Does everything have 100% accuracy?
[1:48:12] <Shatterthought> all attacks and statuses have 100% accuracy barring certain moves
[1:48:15] <%SilverDevilfish> so any idea how long before the game is actually finished? 6 months? A year?
[1:48:15] <%doc_ock_rokc> @AngriestPat it over exausted itself lif you run out of vendurance you hutr yourself
[1:48:15] <+Xeno351> everything has 100 percent acuraccy
[1:48:18] <%Laecerelius> I wonder if they even have invisible items on the ground like Pokemon
[1:48:19] <%Louie_Salmon> Percentage HP heals? Hell yeah!
[1:48:21] <Lunatyr_> Everything has 100 accuracy
[1:48:22] <Masutasodo> There's no RNG in this game yea

[1:48:29] <%Masutasodo> For battle I mean
[1:48:29] <%Nope80808> The lore meta in this game is pretty neet. Almost got the lion starer cause the professor won it in a bar fight.
[1:48:34] <%CommanderSqueaks> Also haven't people name dropped like 3-4 DIFFERENT deities in this game so far?
[1:48:34] <worldbrand> oh that's actually really refreshing to think about
[1:48:35] <+swish20XX> Psn hits for 3 turns and shit
[1:48:40] <$rooooooooooot> 100% accurate hypnosis? im boutta head out

[1:48:45] <NeroCapone> no RNG? in MY (not) pokemon?!
[1:48:47] <$Bonkasaurusrex> Yeah, this feels like it was made with love.
[1:48:49] <luckycloud91> What are you playing this on? @angriestpat
[1:48:51] <+MisterCrimson> @AngriestPat Their goal was to remove the rng that plagues pokemon, so attacks never miss but also never crit
[1:48:53] <%Shadicara> No RNG to make people ass mad? Boooo
[1:48:54] <+bluedude152> Tateru is god tier
[1:48:56] <Oxybe> visually, pokemon has way better set pieces, but this overworld is much more charming IMO
[1:48:58] <haisho> OH NO HE CAN SCRATCH
[1:49:05] <Shatterthought> there are move combos as well. Having a certain type out when you use particular moves can add extra effects/strength/status duration
[1:49:06] <DSD24> You hacked him

[1:49:29] <$rooooooooooot> ah yes 5Head
[1:49:29] <tegas_> but*
[1:49:32] <FstSergeant8595> missing attacks is a common jrpg mechanic though not just pokemon.
[1:49:34] <+loukemia83> it's move cooldown, can only hypnosis once every 2 turns

[1:50:10] <DartonLance> idle animation too
[1:50:13] <+Bloodxb> pokemon has those
[1:50:16] <%Swampykins> Bad news, Pat. Owlmo is actually a chicken.
[1:50:19] <%VioletHeart> SwSh has tons of custom animations.
[1:50:19] <Kalcom> pokemon have them but don't use them cause fuck you
[1:50:21] <SeventyForce> Kill the couplessssss
[1:50:21] <%onlypuppet> Ta-tateru... so cute
[1:50:28] <%GeneralSCPatton> Not focusing fire?
[1:50:29] <FstSergeant8595> @sizableidiot Thats why they add a bunch of abilities that raise and lower evasines
[1:50:30] <DotDusk> monkaS
[1:50:33] <haisho> I can't wait for a Temtem without an animation to just T-pose its way through the overworld
[1:50:34] <%Hilleltaco> It's crazy what you can do when you're not animating 800 characters
[1:50:38] <%doc_ock_rokc> @AngriestPat Elmo used Tenderness on you since the start
[1:50:40] <+threamstream> I like how there's actually some concistency to the textures and lighting. And that things don't pop in 2 feet in front of you. And that it doesn't drop to 10 fps
[1:50:46] <%maskofmichael> "Custom animations are impossible" - Gamefreak maybe
[1:50:53] <%CommanderSqueaks> @haisho I'm waiting for the return of Prime Minister Patron.
[1:50:55] <+sizableidiot> @FstSergeant8595 but the RNG is still there. idk. i dont like rng in a comp. scene
[1:50:57] <Oxybe> pokemon's problem is that it was rushed by pokemon comp. give swo/shld another year to stew and it probably would have been great. for now it's mediocre at best
[1:50:57] <%Louie_Salmon> Don't the birds in Pokemon just A-pose, and half the weirdly shaped ones have no walk cycle
[1:51:04] <+Xeno351> crazy what you can do with actual effort CRAZY I KNOW
[1:51:06] <fairore> run away sir
[1:51:07] <%VioletHeart> Speaking of FPS is the overworld FPS better? It regularly hovered around 5-10 in the stress test.
[1:51:08] <%Engwithan_Elder_God> Makes sense they would be low in XP
[1:51:08] <Bailey__gaming> HahaBall
[1:51:14] <Zaphire_Saucypants> you havin fun, Pat?
[1:51:17] <ShinobiPhoenix> Let;s Go Pikachu already has custom animations
[1:51:17] <@absolute_weapon> The animation style are _exactly_ the same. They have two attack animation types that play when they do an attack that gets an gif that plays over it. It's not ground breaking
[1:51:18] <Bailey__gaming> hey everyone
[1:51:22] <Zaphire_Saucypants> I guess you're havin fun, then.
[1:51:24] <%bevyrage> @AngriestPat you can just click and drag your temtem in the bottom left to reorient the party comp! o D o]bbbb
[1:51:25] <+threamstream> @AngriestPat which tem is best so far?
[1:51:29] <%jemeralddragoon> dont forget that you have to pay almost $60 to get more pokemon ONTOP of paying $60 for a game
[1:51:30] <%bevyrage> *bottom right
[1:51:31] <tegas_> There's plenty of legitimate criticisms of Sword and Shield, but there's also plenty of nonsense ones that people furious about dexit just kind of pulled out of their butts.
[1:51:31] <%bevyrage> fuck me
[1:51:37] <Sotetsu> This game looks great
[1:51:38] <+loukemia83> DId anyone tell Pat about the breeding and SVs?
[1:51:38] <TurbulencEdrive> Crazy what you can do with time
[1:51:40] <haisho> UH OH
[1:51:41] <DSD24> I hope Faceguy comes back
[1:51:45] <Kalcom> then play more of it
[1:51:45] <$rooooooooooot> o D o]bbbb
[1:51:46] <haisho> PATRON HAS A GIRL VOICE
[1:51:47] <%Jack_of_No_Trades> good track
[1:51:48] <KazMkII> At least thtey let you loose, unlike Pokemon
[1:51:50] <$QueequegTheater> @VioletHeart Seems good here but Pat's rig is beyond future-proofed so it could just be that his PC is strong enough
[1:51:54] <%Sogeki_Dan> Pat getting them Mad Temtem sponsorship dollars
[1:51:56] <TioXyco> the fact it's an MMO and youcan Coop too adds to it, right?
[1:52:02] <tegas_> Like sword and shield is a very good looking game, despite a few weird looking screen shots and gifs you may have seen.
[1:52:04] <%CJett92> Yes, Pat knows about Breeding..............ew.....
[1:52:08] <$rooooooooooot> what an idiot to do that
[1:52:12] <%GhostThane> it runs really well on my machine too and it's very middle ground
[1:52:12] <Bailey__gaming> @angriestpat so how is the game?
[1:52:13] <+BubbaRands> surf bordt
[1:52:15] <%CommanderSqueaks> I love how a fourth of the chat is people enjoying the game and another fourth is "It's not that good, stop enjoying it."
[1:52:15] <Shatterthought> @tegas_ yeah, people kept hopping on the outrage train and then all the legit criticism kept being brushed aside as 'oh you just don't like the dex cut' so.... it was really frustrating
[1:52:16] <+threamstream> Looks like HM's are items now
[1:52:17] <tegas_> But for some reason it has no voice acting... which is just weird.
[1:52:19] <$QueequegTheater> @Bailey__gaming big good
[1:52:27] <%TheMattman1313> @AngriestPat It's art-style also makes it relatively timeless so adding new tems/areas won't break the game
[1:52:29] <%Grayhammatter> y'dont
[1:52:32] <dapperskeleton69> @commandersqueaks STOP ENJOYING THE THING I DONT LIKE
[1:52:33] <tegas_> And it's super rushed at the end in a very obvious way.
[1:52:34] <%GeneralSCPatton> @commandersqueaks The Pokemon stans are butthurt
[1:52:36] <haisho> pretty sure that's just a minimaze
[1:52:38] <%Grayhammatter> y'don't say?

[1:52:54] <tegas_> The pokemon "stans" are the ones eating this game up.

[1:52:55] <+threamstream> I'm in a discord that straight up banned anyone from saying anything other than glowing praise of pokemon. Pokemon stans are really toxic

[1:57:07] <%Mindtrick_Matt> lol the idea of twins confusing each other on who is who is hilarious to me
[1:57:08] <%Laecerelius> Fomu better become a Narwhale
[1:57:08] <%BayowolfTerra> Pokemon does that too
[1:57:14] <Dreigun> They do indicate type advantage once you've caught one
[1:57:15] <$QueequegTheater> Gee I would never have guessed from all the BLUE
[1:57:16] <%Swampykins> Like a narwhal?
[1:57:16] <%maskofmichael> It's a dead type
[1:57:18] <%yourliteraldog> It's a cum tyoe
[1:57:18] <dapperskeleton69> the only way to beat the lethal twins is leave to go buy a fighting game

[2:00:06] <+willsimplybe> early team synergy- that's pretty cool
[2:00:07] <$Bonkasaurusrex> That's a neat mechanic

[2:02:58] <SaltyAzteca> Nibble.
[2:03:08] <biomegabear> Hey pat hows temtem?
[2:03:10] <%Cykron> That Kakazu thing is awesome
[2:03:11] <+ulti75> Hey, if you have your mouse nearby you can rearrange your Temtem by dragging and dropping the icons in the bottom right.
[2:03:15] <Aruvella> This game seems surprisingly fun.
[2:03:20] <tanarath> this music is amazing
[2:03:20] <%jiin6> did you take the shirtless mans money?
[2:03:22] <%yourliteraldog> @CommanderSqueaks It has flared fuckingbase
[2:03:29] <%CommanderSqueaks> TEM
[2:03:29] <%DappercatEsquire> Does anyone else kind of like the understated designs compared to recent overdesigned Pokemon?
[2:03:33] <%dalmek> I mean, sometimes
[2:03:38] <Kalcom> eh
[2:03:39] <%dalmek> some of them are eh, imo
[2:03:39] <%Engwithan_Elder_God> STRANGER DANGER
[2:03:43] <Shatterthought> the responses can get so snarky
[2:03:44] <$rooooooooooot> that person has a rat :o
[2:03:46] <Zaphire_Saucypants> markedly better than the dialogue I encountered in Sw/Sh
[2:03:46] <Zekuu69> Battle Theme reminds me of FF 13
[2:03:49] <$Bonkasaurusrex> Do Temtem's evolve?
[2:03:49] <@ShockzNDrawe> it's LITERALLY a KIOSK
[2:03:51] <%VioletHeart> I thought the dialogue was one of the weakest parts.
[2:03:51] <%FacetiousAF> gonna be honest, he's been at this long than i thought he'd be

[2:08:41] <%bevyrage> Y for details
[2:08:42] <%draugrix> @shadicara apatBougie_HF
[2:08:43] <%Ninestempest> @AngriestPat matchups aren't in the game, i''ve been googling for it lol
[2:08:43] <%GhostThane> i wrote down all of them lol, it'll tell you all the type stuff in a bit in the game
[2:08:44] <%Deadpal> Deadpal subscribed with Twitch Prime. They've subscribed for 21 months, currently on a 1 month streak! God, 21 months. I hate that I missed a month! Anyways, I hope you're enjoying TemTem. Makes me want to get it! This isn't from the pokemon online team right?
[2:08:45] <InvaderKAZ> Press details?
[2:08:46] <CirclesForever> pokemon doesnt have an in game type matchup chart
[2:08:47] <+TomServal> Ted's Temporium, run by Tem Master Ted Sheckler.
[2:08:47] <tegas_> Which makes sense, this is an indie.
[2:08:48] <biomegabear> In battle the movies tell you what is good on what by what they're highlighted

[2:09:33] <Dreigun> there are
[2:09:34] <Sol_Install> yea
[2:09:38] <%Jekado> there are dual types
[2:09:38] <$QueequegTheater> yay
[2:09:38] <Cranky_Construct> That only works if you've caught the enemy you're targeting
[2:09:43] <SweepTheLegoMyEggo> @AngriestPat I just tweeted you the type chart
[2:09:45] <%Ninestempest> INCORRECT
[2:09:46] <InvaderKAZ> you have to have caught it
[2:09:47] <cherrycottontail> It only does that if you've caught that TEMTEM before
[2:09:50] <+swish20XX> Color around of the ring when attacking
[2:09:53] <tegas_> Like are people just looking at that one image form the internet where that guy forced a place holder animation on one of the legendaries?
[2:09:57] <TCCBros> the color around the target
[2:09:59] <critfumble_> the toucan is super cute
[2:10:01] <TCCBros> not the move
[2:10:05] <NinjaTB> what console is temtem on?
[2:10:12] <lambishly> PC
[2:10:12] <foreverN2dust> PC
[2:10:14] <%Jekado> pc currently
[2:10:16] <%Laecerelius> I think that your bug's poison move is super effective

[2:10:18] <fabo_joyful> pc
[2:10:18] <KingVantq> @NinjaTB none yet

[2:10:20] <lambishly> it's on steam
[2:10:21] <+BKNPham> it should be around the move, seems more intuitive

[2:10:58] <$QueequegTheater> @tegas_ Sword and Shield is better than the circlejerk says it is but still far worse than it should be with the disgusting amount of money Pokemon makes as a brand
[2:11:03] <dapperskeleton69> is temtem on consoles or just pc?
[2:11:04] <+ReiDuran> Could you fucking imagine if this game came out on Switch

[2:11:50] <@ShockzNDrawe> THAT WAS A STOCK QUACK SOUND
[2:11:51] <%SocialMisfitGamer> You gotta catch that Saipat @AngriestPat
[2:11:53] <tegas_> @QueequegTheater agreed, which is why it's frustrating when people resort to inaccurate criticisms when theres plenty of legitimate ones to be made.

[2:12:52] <%draugrix> apatBougie_HF apatBougie fuckko

[2:14:16] <+BubbaRands> Built in Nuzlocke PogChamp
[2:14:16] <TheWe4pon> Are there any fuckable TemTems?
[2:14:17] <%Laecerelius> A fucking Hardcore mode for this PokeMMO?
[2:14:18] <jasnake> THeres no way Nintendo will ever let this be on the switch
[2:14:19] <%Owkono> temlocke
[2:14:19] <%Grayhammatter> oh... oh no, but also yes
[2:14:20] <deity_majora> So the Nuzlocke ends with the first battle
[2:14:24] <+TheIntellectional> so this is the new digimon huh
[2:14:27] <biomegabear> Do you think this game needs an offline mode?
[2:14:27] <%doc_ock_rokc> Did they set themselves up as trainers?
[2:14:27] <%Engwithan_Elder_God> Nuzlocke on a system you've never played? Insane.
[2:14:30] <Sol_Install> but it's coming to the switch
[2:14:30] <SlickDroid> Nuzlock gamemode? I'm offically IN
[2:14:32] <%xxinevitablexii> I'll get thes when I have money
[2:14:37] <%AmericanaRed> pokemon: 4Head temtem: apatBougie
[2:14:37] <%leinadtonu> Imagine a franchise of battling monsters ...
[2:14:39] <$floralkami> is it called Nuzlocke?
[2:14:39] <Vileosis> @deity_majora LUL
[2:14:40] <VritraReiRei> @AngriestPat what makes you like this more than Pokemon (minus the fact it's an MMO)
[2:14:41] <%Louie_Salmon> @thewe4ponI I mean, you can fuck whatever you want
[2:14:43] <%Shadicara> I can legit see pokemon fans jumping on temtem to full on spite game freak LUL
[2:14:44] <%GarbageNirvana> They're not actually going to call it Nuzlocke I hope
[2:14:44] <%jiin6> the first big fight is a no win fight? dam
[2:14:49] <42nfl19> Don't forget to use @AngriestPat 's GMG link below. SHILL FOR PAT
[2:14:50] <dapperskeleton69> CASTLESUPERBEAST NUZLOCKE LP WHEN
[2:14:51] <oniwahoo> @floralkami yup
[2:14:56] <%Grayhammatter> no
[2:14:57] <$QueequegTheater> @floralkami No reason not to, the term isn't actually owned by GF/Ninty
[2:14:58] <%yourliteraldog> yes
[2:15:00] <%JojoPiero> Beef/em up, Fuck'em down
[2:15:01] <foreverN2dust> Just wait till pat gets the estus flask
[2:15:01] <$rooooooooooot> fuck them down
[2:15:03] <%Laecerelius> apatBig BEEF!
[2:15:05] <%Hilleltaco> I hope it puts like a Fire Emblem slow motion effect on when your Temtem dies
[2:15:05] <%GabeSweetMan> Nuzlocke lasts 3 minutes cuz you die in the first batlle lol
[2:15:05] <cherrycottontail> That patch is there because every individual grass patch has it's own Pokemon list
[2:15:06] <%Louie_Salmon> Beef 'em up, fuck 'em down
[2:15:07] <%maskofmichael> Beef em up, fuck em down
[2:15:08] <TheWe4pon> I mean Gardevoir levels of fuckable
[2:15:09] <%yourliteraldog> BEEF UP BOIS
[2:15:09] <+BubbaRands> Nuzlocke isn't copyright so we CAN name it that
[2:15:11] <SeventyForce> Big beeffy fug
[2:15:15] <+UltraViolet371> Could be worse than fucking up?
[2:15:18] <%bevyrage> @GabeSweetMan you get a new pokemon after that fight
[2:15:20] <dapperskeleton69> beef up, fuck down, thats the way we like to temtem
[2:15:20] <%rumtumtugnutz> I think they call it Nuzlike. but it'll be called something else by implementation.
[2:15:22] <$floralkami> @QueequegTheater ik, tho i thought Nuzlocke was a pokemon, no?
[2:15:23] <tegas_> They probably want to put their own spin on the name regardless
[2:15:24] <Broand> EMERALD SPLASH
[2:15:24] <%PerrinIsDead> Beef up fuck down
[2:15:24] <%Louie_Salmon> Beef tem up, fuck tem down
[2:15:28] <@StridentSong> @AngriestPat The earliest you can get a Saipat is the diagonal grass next to the "Upper Indigo Lake" sign when you start climbing the mountain
[2:15:29] <%GarbageNirvana> It's such a dumb name tho
[2:15:29] <%xxinevitablexii> Nuzlocke is a Pokemon
[2:15:38] <%Laecerelius> oh my god, it is emerald splash
[2:15:39] <+willsimplybe> no, Nuzleaf is a pokemon
[2:15:43] <%draugrix> apatBig apatDab
[2:15:45] <$QueequegTheater> @floralkami NuzLEAF is, the Locke was a Lost reference by the guy who invented the term
[2:15:47] <@StridentSong> It has a super low appearance rate though, like 15%
[2:15:53] <%GabeSweetMan> Nuzlocke is a waifu.
[2:15:57] <+BubbaRands> @xxinevitablexii No Nuzleaf is
[2:16:00] <kayamek> We need TemTem digimon mode the only difference is that they all are holding guns.
[2:16:01] <%xxinevitablexii> shit you right
[2:16:02] <Kalcom> you can't just use pokemon names tho
[2:16:02] <$floralkami> @QueequegTheater aaaaahhhh
[2:16:03] <+BubbaRands> Nuzlocke is nothing
[2:16:03] <%bevyrage> so nuzlocke means if the starting fight IS valid then you get the bird as your starter instead.
[2:16:04] <dapperskeleton69> nuzlocke is a function
[2:16:05] <$rooooooooooot> talk to travlyn
[2:16:07] <%Shadicara> There's a literal guide you can find that explains what nuzlocke is
[2:16:10] <%GabeSweetMan> Nuzlocke is everything.
[2:16:13] <%YaBoiShamoi> Nobody wants a fucky tem
[2:16:13] <$QueequegTheater> Nuzlocke is a way of life
[2:16:15] <$rooooooooooot> travlyn has a super good item
[2:16:15] <%Ninestempest> No one tell pat the healing kiosk resemblers a urinal
[2:16:17] <%Binary_Fireball> motherfucking send them to cooleg
[2:16:18] <Kalcom> that's why they don't use iv and ev
[2:16:27] <+BubbaRands> As far as gamefreak is concerned nuzlocke is nothing
[2:16:27] <$QueequegTheater> I nuzlocke my relationships
[2:16:27] <Broand> Yo this artstyle is gread
[2:16:27] <%GabeSweetMan> Nuzlocke is death.
[2:16:35] <%Wynzler> I'm just now tuning in, are there elemental types in this game?
[2:16:41] <RDknight> can you interact with your temtem while walking?
[2:16:48] <$rekinom> There's a type chart on their kickstarter page @AngriestPat

[2:18:41] <Quietshun13> x and y. gens 4 and 5 were great
[2:18:41] <%Taisuru> Black and White were amazing
[2:18:42] <+FaceSizzle> after gen 5
[2:18:44] <AxelCezar> oooof
[2:18:44] <+Bloodxb> x and y
[2:18:45] <%Monkeyweed21> fuck you Platinum is amazing
[2:18:46] <KazMkII> PLATINUM IS GOAT Pat
[2:18:46] <lambishly> Diamond and Pearl SUCKED
[2:18:46] <Explodincatz> after gem 1
[2:18:46] <%VioletHeart> XY are the first time a gen dipped below the previous one. SM and USUM were both super good and SwSh's pretty good too.
[2:18:47] <%AmericanaRed> correct
[2:18:47] <%Darren716> Pat you dont even care about pokemon
[2:18:48] <CirclesForever> gen 2 was a mistake
[2:18:49] <dapperskeleton69> when they started pushing complicated online shit
[2:18:49] <ohgodscorpions> thats accurate
[2:18:50] <+HyperCharge_Sam> Gen 3 was when they stopped adding in all the Pokemon
[2:18:51] <zayasu> ruby and saphire were trash :)
[2:18:51] <seaechiowai> 3ds era
[2:18:51] <%JojoPiero> OH FUCK A NEFIE
[2:18:52] <tegas_> Old man yells at cloud.
[2:18:52] <%ThatRandomGuy661> Emerald tho
[2:18:52] <Kalcom> opinions discarded ok
[2:18:53] <archangel9889> @AngriestPat its almost the same as pokemon. crystal type is an analog of steel type
[2:18:54] <$rooooooooooot> ü•î ü•î ü•î ü•î ü•î ü•î
[2:18:54] <oniwahoo> Ruby, Sapphire and Emerald were solid games
[2:18:55] <+beensupe> OH no here come the B/W fiends LUL
[2:18:55] <+willsimplybe> Gen 5 was good, but gen 4 was meh... but gen 6 was really the downfall.
[2:18:56] <%Taisuru> Pat no
[2:18:56] <+Doppio1089> Ultra Sun And Moon
[2:18:57] <Dutchpotato> Once it went 3D
[2:18:58] <%doc_ock_rokc> @MayorRev XnY is okay Sun and Moon were actually good
[2:18:58] <s1rcuit> my interest in the series died after D&P
[2:18:59] <$floralkami> I will say everything after Diamond and Pearl
[2:18:59] <%mighty_max_t> Black & White were good, X & Y were the start of the downfall though
[2:18:59] <+the_krypto_knight> I think pokemon has never been better, it just should be a lot better
[2:19:00] <+PanicSwytch> LUL LUL
[2:19:01] <dapperskeleton69> POTATEN
[2:19:01] <Cryocian> Why is that guy fake Irish
[2:19:02] <+DashXero> HG & SS were retreads of Gold and Silver. They barely count.
[2:19:02] <%ha2ken> apatBougie apatBougie apatBougie
[2:19:03] <%jiin6> x and y was pretty good, sun and moon felt too easy
[2:19:03] <%draugrix> Pokemon has been bad since yellow
[2:19:04] <%xxinevitablexii> stab him
[2:19:04] <%wydamn> Oh no, Pat's gone full Newfie
[2:19:04] <%Agami23> i'd disagree, because the 3d models REALLY fucked stuff
[2:19:04] <$QueequegTheater> @AngriestPat HG/SS is the perfect Pokemon game and it cam out after Gen 3 tho
[2:19:05] <%mh9s> faith and beggorah
[2:19:06] <dapperskeleton69> POTATEM

[2:19:11] <%Engwithan_Elder_God> 2 on 1?
[2:19:11] <@commanderclaw> I'd argue Ruby and Sapphire is where it plateaued, and Pearl and Diamond were the first genuine steps back
[2:19:12] <TheWe4pon> Just checked the Temtem wiki and I'm not seening any really fuckable Tems
[2:19:12] <%draugrix> apatBougie apatDab apatBougie_HF apatDab apatBougie apatDab apatBougie_HF apatDab apatBougie
[2:19:15] <%Wynzler> IMO Pok√©mon started going down the toilet when it introduced game mechanics that made for a more dynamic experience the generation after they were introduced
[2:19:16] <%JojoPiero> Pat stop making fun of Newfies
[2:19:16] <CaptainSama> pat when was the last time you were actually in a fist fight

[2:44:31] <%Aeoneth> Pat.exe has suddenly failed
[2:44:31] <%TinyLittleDancer> I'm just saying this isn't the difference between Dragon Quest Monsters vs. Pokemon ... even not from a legal standpoint it's still offputting
[2:44:36] <%Louie_Salmon> Isn't it amazing how exciting even the slightest innovation to this formula is?
[2:44:37] <XdaXcaptainX> is this Anor Temlo?

[2:44:56] <$QueequegTheater> @bootysteve It's good by the standards of 2003, but unfortunately I live in 2020
[2:44:57] <%Nope80808> @Decoyhound
[2:44:59] <%Grayhammatter> and your temessence is refilled
[2:45:01] <%Atomik456> @bluedude152 you cant sue for gameplay mechanics that got settled ages ago
[2:45:02] <+coldtaters> im fine guys
[2:45:02] <%Laecerelius> Taterz is weak. He's holding your team back!
[2:45:07] <%Nope80808> @Decoyhound POOL IS CLOSED
[2:45:12] <+bluedude152> im being a doofus
[2:45:13] <%jiin6> if only taterz had a better trainer
[2:45:16] <$bootysteve> got any talking points you didn't get from a youtube video?
[2:45:16] <Decoyhound> POOLS CLOSED
[2:45:18] <exileshadow03> I see Pat is applying the "no spellcheck" rule to his speech now lol
[2:45:20] <+NotSoAccurateNo1> techdecks
[2:45:20] <dapperskeleton69> ao when do we go to blightem town to get toxic temtems
[2:45:23] <%bevyrage> LOOK AT THE LIL HOPS
[2:45:24] <+bluedude152> I just see that question in every temtem chat
[2:45:27] <+BubbaRands> You know how to do shit? Yep. Well fuck off
[2:45:33] <%RubberFistFight> @TinyLittleDancer there's no legal dispute to be had here though. TemTem is legally distinct from Pokemon - and as Pat rightly pointed out when he started, Pokemon don't have a trademark on the idea of monster hunting/capturing, and Megami Tensei did it first anyway.
[2:45:34] <haisho> alas poor Taterz. Got mashed into pieces.
[2:45:35] <XdaXcaptainX> ded forever :(
[2:45:35] <Zaphire_Saucypants> better boil him, mash him, stick him in a stew, Pat.
[2:45:38] <BinaryShuffle> Temtemology LUL

[2:45:57] <%Louie_Salmon> Temtemology seems like a WIDE field
[2:46:02] <$QueequegTheater> @bootysteve Why bother innovating my arguments when Pokemon hasn't innovated their gameplay since the physical special split
[2:46:02] <%blaggablag> Lookit that temtrainer with his FANCY PRANCE
[2:46:03] <fairore> @xumbrellabatx DansGame
[2:46:04] <Decoyhound> god i hope they eat temtems
[2:46:04] <Neo_Kaiser> Has someone mentioned that DSP blew 40,000 bucks on a mobile phone game?
[2:46:05] <%Louie_Salmon> Like too wide to be a single class
[2:46:05] <CrabSlacks> it's so realilistic
[2:46:16] <%Monkeyweed21> What Town does Yui Ikari live in @AngriestPat ?
[2:46:16] <%Grayhammatter> that's crazy
[2:46:22] <%EndlessScrapper> As someone who stopped playing pokemon at Gold (mostly because I stop buying handhelds. Poor kids only get to pick one gaming device.) This game is really sweet.
[2:46:22] <BinaryShuffle> I prefer Temechanics and Temgineering
[2:46:24] <sonicspark007> I'm gonna head out take care everybody

[2:46:43] <Decoyhound> i hope the devs have the balls to put in temtem eating
[2:46:44] <KaliasTV> Imagine your house constantly invaded by idiot kids
[2:46:45] <%Laecerelius> Unlike your completely not black trainer
[2:46:45] <Nekros4442> Makes the world actually feel like a world instead of stagnant
[2:46:48] <%jiin6> look at all this home invasion
[2:46:52] <%Jack_of_No_Trades> tyrell the lion faded from living memory
[2:47:02] <ohgodscorpions> i got a degree in tembral arts it was not a waste of money
[2:47:05] <%TinyLittleDancer> @RubberFistFight I'm aware of that, I specifically mentioned another example of the genre (Dragon Quest). My issue isn't with the legality per se
[2:47:06] <%ArcanumMBD> @QueequegTheater Oak was a trainer in his youth so he majored in kicking ass
[2:47:08] <dapperskeleton69> as someone who had their copy of emerald lost by their lil bro long time ago, this game rocks
[2:47:08] <%bevyrage> unless you got a shiny
[2:47:09] <%DappercatEsquire> FUTURE RESET YEAH
[2:47:14] <%Cykron> Look at these weirdos
[2:47:15] <+HeyBoston> go beat the SHIT out of sophia
[2:47:17] <%Sausious> is there a way to turn off other players? that's the thing i'm just not into
[2:47:18] <%tank7013> It kind of multiplies the problem of everybody just letting a weird kid into their homes because now they're letting in dozens of weird kids
[2:47:18] <%jiin6> Taterz is gonna permantly die?
[2:47:21] <XdaXcaptainX> someday i want to be a ma-tem-atician when i grow up
[2:47:29] <%Louie_Salmon> @queequegtheater I mean, I could see "New wild pokemon classification" being a study at least
[2:47:33] <%Nope80808> SAHDE
[2:47:33] <%Stevennapalm> big tiddy goth gf
[2:47:34] <+RowenCleric> is Pat able to tell other characters about his black face?
[2:47:35] <+dandara_> BibleThump
[2:47:35] <+swish20XX> It's an MMO. That's the game it is
[2:47:39] <%hntronium> pound sophia into the ground
[2:47:42] <$bootysteve> So pokemon hasn't updated since 2003 (gen 3), but also hasn't updated since the physical special split (gen 4)?
[2:47:46] <Punisher7771> mmm
[2:47:46] <%yourliteraldog> You can be shitty to your rival 10/10
[2:47:56] <+bluedude152> its updated plenty

[2:48:27] <%Agami23> oh lord, she is talking about inflations
[2:48:29] <%jiin6> punt the child
[2:48:29] <$QueequegTheater> @bootysteve Look, I'm really not interested in arguing this. Pokemon is fun but has been stagnant for a decade and a half
[2:48:30] <%thatWaulfyguy> wait, what is this game? is this the pokemon adjacent indie game?

[2:48:58] <%Laecerelius> There's a sex predator in that house!
[2:48:59] <+Qsmash_> the turtle hut
[2:49:00] <haisho> the fact that instant text boxes aren't a thing in games is a crime
[2:49:03] <Decoyhound> its not so much a game as much as a facebook app
[2:49:04] <%ssjklyco> That's Anor Londo

[2:49:21] <%SolverCODO> @Laecerelius those wacky sex predators!
[2:49:26] <%Nope80808> Im angry they refuse to drop the 2 version slightly different con theyve been running for 2 decades.
[2:49:29] <+swish20XX> I think people want an immersive open world pokemon game but it hasn't been done the way we had hoped yet
[2:49:32] <Ravoric> So how does pvp work?
[2:49:33] <ohgodscorpions> there's a pedo in that house be careful!

[2:51:11] <%rumtumtugnutz> @pyr0_fr0st no waifu potential imho.
[2:51:14] <XdaXcaptainX> @Shadicara squeeze temtem into every senTEMce
[2:51:15] <%Nope80808> @dapperskeleton69 Thatd be unreasonable if they werent one of the most profitable ips around.
[2:51:19] <%yourliteraldog> real feels
[2:51:24] <%Agami23> just smack it with a shoe!
[2:51:33] <dapperskeleton69> just blowtorch it
[2:51:39] <%RubberFistFight> @bootysteve there's plenty to dislike about sw/sh, despite what supporters claim. From the fact that they lied about the models being too complex and hard to port, to the lies about not having plans to release DLC. From top to bottom it's just been mired by low-effort greedy money-grubbing behaviour, which is justifiably tainted the game and franchise in many peoples eyes.
[2:51:40] <Decoyhound> start bullying kids
[2:51:48] <dapperskeleton69> or punch it until it unlocks like this one kid at my old HS did

[2:58:18] <$arcielardor> Pat TemTem memes are already trending on the subreddit.
[2:58:26] <Clinnamon> "No and I don't care" is an option I wish was in every rpg dialogue
[2:58:33] <%RubberFistFight> @QueequegTheater oh I was just going to /r/temtem . Also apparently the devs have been getting death threats broadly split equally between pokemon supporters, and salty fucks who are angry the early access game isn't perfectly stable. Which is basically WHY WE CAN'T HAVE NICE THINGS. Fucking assholes.
[2:58:35] <Zaphire_Saucypants> "I must go"
[2:58:38] <dapperskeleton69> the subreddit has become a temtem subreddit now

[3:03:49] <%wrightlight94> Yep its ok
[3:03:50] <+skiassassin> But what do you think of the price pat
[3:03:50] <Maxicqwe> its fine
[3:03:50] <Explodincatz> pokemon is dead

[3:03:53] <Barrboat> yes
[3:03:55] <+FaceSizzle> playing as we speak!

[3:03:56] <%onlypuppet> Yes
[3:03:56] <trianglehat> hmm all those affiliate bucks
[3:03:56] <+mmack093> I wish the designs were a bit more inspired
[3:03:56] <+Agentoracle> loving it.
[3:03:57] <%honeyman18> it looks dope
[3:03:58] <BallinArbiter> Yes
[3:03:58] <%zafooru> I'll admit its a little tough getting past the visuals for me. Seems like a pokemon though!
[3:03:58] <Dreigun> seems pretty solid
[3:03:58] <%CrimsonCore90> How much mula?
[3:03:58] <%passthehanky> i've been playing during the stream and it's really awesome
[3:03:58] <%blaggablag> surprisingly satisfying
[3:03:59] <Darthkitten_Prime> I don't care for the monster designs, but the gameplay seems cool
[3:03:59] <Segartner> yes
[3:03:59] <%trustycoyote> Yeah! Looks super fun!
[3:04:00] <Dutchpotato> Yes
[3:04:01] <%Th33KC> duck temtem can be caught in this cliff area
[3:04:03] <%StaceMcGate> Has he fought a gym leader or whatever they're called yet?
[3:04:06] <+Jaysky> Art style could use some work but apart from that it seems good
[3:04:06] <%ssjklyco> atemtem moment
[3:04:07] <%Laecerelius> Is Cigardog related to D-Dog?
[3:04:07] <TCCBros> all 2 songs
[3:04:08] <%weissguard> Looks like a fun time.
[3:04:08] <Quietshun13> gundogs cousin
[3:04:08] <$QueequegTheater> @AngriestPat Your stream has convinced me to buy it as soon as I have a spare $40
[3:04:10] <Decoyhound> meh/10 whens ff8 lol
[3:04:11] <+BKNPham> lol Keikaku
[3:04:13] <%jemeralddragoon> temtem seems pretty cool but i dont think early alpha is worth $35
[3:04:14] <%Tracazoid> I haven't played it yet but it looks surprisingly good, if only they had the infinity dollars that Nintendo/Gamefreak could pull into Pokemon.
[3:04:16] <+winds_0f_change> yeah
[3:04:16] <haisho> except for that Rival Battle music at the start
[3:04:16] <%CrimsonCore90> Stumbeak be gone
[3:04:20] <haisho> that music was kinda flaccid
[3:04:20] <Sydin18> OH THATS A GLITCH
[3:04:21] <ElenaManetta> So, if everyone is playing the same game, what is the point of trading with people? Unless there are TemTem that are AGONIZINGLY rare.
[3:04:24] <%darthfodder> that moment when indie early access Pokemon out Pokemon's Pokemon
[3:04:25] <Gr4ndm4rsh4ll> @angriestpat don‚Äôt forget about your estus if you‚Äôre too far away!
[3:04:27] <%TheMattman1313> SourPls Even this song is great
[3:04:34] <tanarath> Soundtrack is violin and it's amazing.
[3:04:35] <haisho> POCKET SAND

[3:04:37] <+A0N33> Scavenger is an amazing ability, it's so Pog
[3:04:39] <critfumble_> I'm scared that toucan is going to be one of those looks great at evo1 looks terrible at evo2+
[3:04:42] <%Laecerelius> Skailiva has big HP EVs
[3:04:42] <Quietshun13> fuck fighting
[3:04:42] <%tank7013> Is that a goddamn pocket sand attack?
[3:04:47] <%zafooru> alllll according to keikaku
[3:04:48] <+Jaysky> Keikaku means plan
[3:04:48] <%yourliteraldog> Pocket Sand
[3:04:50] <%trustycoyote> Pocket sand LUL
[3:04:50] <Broand> Not according to keykaku
[3:04:51] <%bevyrage> wait why is owlmo small again
[3:04:55] <+ReiDuran> Wait what Owlmo is back to being small
[3:04:55] <13ig_Kain> Do you think this will come to consoles?
[3:04:58] <%Niney_Who> Josef Jostar
[3:05:00] <%bread_assassin> How do you like the Temtem designs compared to the new pokemon designs from Sword/Shield?
[3:05:00] <%zafooru> plan means japanese sword
[3:05:02] <CurrySauseBandit> That they give priority stats on moves is a godsend.
[3:05:03] <+Vivevent> uh oh i think pat got the evolution bug
[3:05:04] <%RubberFistFight> @darthfodder probably because they actually wanted to make a good game, instead of just a lazy, rushed, unfinished and unpolished cashgrab.
[3:05:06] <$QueequegTheater> Owlmo reverted WTF
[3:05:14] <foreverN2dust> @Vivevent get the fuck out
[3:05:18] <+BKNPham> I bet the price point is to save their servers lol

[3:05:58] <Decoyhound> he was transferred to ghost pat
[3:05:58] <thankyou_lostfound> I think the major difference in design betwen temtem and pokemon is the color palet between the monster and the enviroment
[3:05:59] <gslayer14> regressive birb
[3:05:59] <+ReiDuran> Early access!
[3:06:00] <%tank7013> Welp, early access
[3:06:01] <%Laecerelius> Huh
[3:06:01] <Sydin18> FINE, ITS EARLY ACCESS
[3:06:01] <%aeravon> Known bug, the de-evolving
[3:06:02] <13ig_Kain> I really kinda hoping this comes to console
[3:06:04] <ImmaCanuck> ????
[3:06:04] <ElenaManetta> I think it's a known bug at the moment because I've seen it pop up on the Steam forums a bunch
[3:06:05] <%zafooru> Where are all the blood elves? i thought this was thalassian cliffs
[3:06:06] <%Cykron> DIGIVOLVE INTO CHAMPIONS
[3:06:11] <%NopeBadguy> @AngriestPat Would you recommend this for someone who is disappointed by modern Pokemon?
[3:06:11] <%GeneralSCPatton> WHAT
[3:06:12] <%StaceMcGate> is that a bug or a feature?
[3:06:13] <%Order_of_Mystery> uh oh

[3:06:20] <Sol_Install> De-evolving bug nice~
[3:06:21] <trianglehat> sand fart
[3:06:22] <ryankr2> Exactly why it shouldn‚Äôt cost 35 bucks
[3:06:26] <%zafooru> i cant believe owlmo was just pretending to be stronger
[3:06:28] <$QueequegTheater> His final form was too powerful
[3:06:28] <BinaryShuffle> warp evolution please
[3:06:28] <ElenaManetta> Does Owlmo go DOWN in level if he reverts though?
[3:06:30] <%Shadicara> That's hilarious
[3:06:31] <mostundesired> Oh hey, it's this thing. How's it compare to Pokeymans so far?
[3:06:31] <EuropanLamprey> You named it Owlmo, it has decided to stay looking like an Owl
[3:06:32] <%CrimsonCore90> Owlmo used ...get fucked!
[3:06:32] <%doc_ock_rokc> Change into digital champions toooo save the digtial world
[3:06:38] <$QueequegTheater> He has to hold himself back like Freeza
[3:06:39] <austinj24> Shoulda named it Ska is bad
[3:06:42] <%Cykron> SIKE
[3:06:45] <%Ninestempest> What bug does he have?
[3:06:50] <tanarath> @nopebadguy I hear yokaiwatch is good, bit this seems great.
[3:06:51] <mankeytennis> Owlmo just Gigantamaxed
[3:06:51] <Decoyhound> wouldnt have happened to blackface pat
[3:06:52] <%darthfodder> little bit of wet paint
[3:06:54] <Zaphire_Saucypants> pepper breath dat bitch.
[3:06:54] <Broand> don't forget your bestus flask
[3:06:57] <CurrySauseBandit> Bruh, that exclamation notice sound
[3:06:57] <Xelgus> the sword and shield starters feel like the weakest yet, which sucks, but it was cool to see Temtem pick up the slack
[3:06:58] <%bevyrage> @AngriestPat down below is where you can catch saipat remember!
[3:07:00] <+Mitchellsocks> Wow, when i heard this described as "that new pokemon style MMO" I was not expecting it to be this blatant
[3:07:02] <Zaphire_Saucypants> with your Agumon.
[3:07:10] <+Doppio1089> Are there Natures in this game?
[3:07:12] <%RubberFistFight> @ryankr2 man, they haven't been hiding that it's early access and buggy as shit. If people still wanna pay $35 for that then I say let em.
[3:07:17] <13ig_Kain> Is this gonna be free to play?
[3:07:17] <$QueequegTheater> @Mitchellsocks You can't sue over stolen game mechanics
[3:07:18] <ape_hawk> so where's the gun temtem, cowards!?
[3:07:27] <%Cykron> I was always a Tentomon mark
[3:07:29] <koolkatdq> Can you paint your Pok√©mon
[3:07:30] <Zaudrix> "Want a friendly temtem battle? btw you can't say no"
[3:07:30] <mostundesired> ... This is a lawsuit waiting to happen.
[3:07:37] <$QueequegTheater> @mostundesired Nope
[3:07:39] <%RubberFistFight> @mostundesired no it isn't but ok LUL
[3:07:40] <%zafooru> that fish makes me uncomfortable in a way i cant' quite explain
[3:07:43] <%bevyrage> it's legally distinct enough that nothing will come of any lawsuit you know
[3:07:48] <Broand> Nah it's good
[3:07:49] <+donbomber777> This will never get sued
[3:07:50] <ape_hawk> pokemon doesnt have a trademark on monster capture games
[3:07:53] <Zaphire_Saucypants> Nintendo doesn't OWN the concept of monstesr.
[3:07:53] <%EndlessScrapper> Um excuse me Piiranant your fish appears to be flying. Thats some op bullcrap
[3:07:56] <mostundesired> Holy shit guys I just got here. LUL
[3:08:03] <%Cykron> I love the shark
[3:08:03] <Zaphire_Saucypants> jesus
[3:08:07] <$shurtal> I thought that said crystal meth for a second
[3:08:11] <thankyou_lostfound> wait, is every battle a 2v2 or are there 1v1 in there?
[3:08:13] <%Shadicara> That's like saying yokai watch is gonna get sued LUL
[3:08:16] <Decoyhound> blood sacrifice
[3:08:17] <$notEisiger> They WILL be sued by Digimon
[3:08:20] <ape_hawk> "GEMLO, USE CRYSTAL METH!"
[3:08:23] <%doc_ock_rokc> @mostundesired If you say "And boy my arms are tired" I'll punch you
[3:08:24] <%bevyrage> NO GEMLO
[3:08:28] <ElenaManetta> I really want Pat to get the shark thing.
[3:08:29] <$QueequegTheater> GEMLO NOOOOO
[3:08:29] <%RubberFistFight> @Zaphire_Saucypants expect a lot of this shit in the coming weeks. Pokemon stans can't handle the fact that an actual, potentially superior contender, has appeared.
[3:08:30] <dapperskeleton69> thats like saying shin megami tensei will get sued
[3:08:32] <%Laecerelius> Woof
[3:08:33] <%Cykron> It was super effective
[3:08:33] <+donbomber777> Totally legally safe
[3:08:34] <%zafooru> RIP gelmo you were truly the worst among us
[3:08:35] <$QueequegTheater> BibleThump
[3:08:35] <+Kataiser> The game's literally going to be on the Switch. I think Nintendo would shoot it down before that idea.
[3:08:49] <13ig_Kain> How does this compare to Yo Kai Watch?
[3:08:50] <Maxicqwe> wow actual music in a pokemon game
[3:08:53] <%bevyrage> IT LOOKS LIKE A FISH fuck it up
[3:08:55] <%xxinevitablexii> i like that one
[3:08:55] <CrabSlacks> ~I will remember you~ RIP
[3:08:55] <austinj24> Gemlo more like DeadLo
[3:08:58] <%CrimsonCore90> Pimp Slap!
[3:08:58] <CurrySauseBandit> @thankyou_lostfound Crystal Meth to the face is a valid attack. Whoever tells you otherwise is a meth huffing liar. Kappa
[3:09:07] <Zaphire_Saucypants> @RubberFistFight I gathered as much. Not gonna let it bother me too much tho.
[3:09:12] <%aishman> @kataiser Seeing as how Dragon Quest Monster is in Nintendo consoles along with Yokai Watch. they don't care
[3:09:18] <+Jontman42> slap
[3:09:18] <$notEisiger> the core defining feature of a pokemon game is if anyone is willing to fuck all of your creatures
[3:09:20] <$QueequegTheater> @austinj24 How dare you make light of this tragedy
[3:09:20] <EuropanLamprey> "Hmm, what type could this fucking fish be I wonder?"
[3:09:25] <Clinnamon> anyone remember the shaman king games on gba where you could catch spirits?
[3:09:29] <%jemeralddragoon> Nintendo literally doesnt care
[3:09:33] <ElenaManetta> I missed a chunk of the game, does this have a linear "Pokemon beat the Elite Four" story or is it MMO missions story?
[3:09:37] <+BubbaRands> I've never wanted plushies of something so badly before
[3:09:46] <cowboydandank> i had high hopes for the animations from the impressions on the podcast, but a lot of 'em are about as good as the majority of pokemon's-- unfortunately pokemon still has some reeally shitty ones that are easy to point to as the worst examples
[3:09:49] <%zafooru> thats a cute pig-adjacent creature
[3:09:50] <Zaphire_Saucypants> cute porker
[3:09:51] <%cylish> Hey Pat, had a thought about Nioh2. Why not treat it like destiny? Dont they have the same problems with random item bonuses?
[3:09:55] <ckkc1> epig :DDD
[3:09:55] <CrabSlacks> Pig team Epic
[3:09:55] <%Cykron> FEESH
[3:09:58] <Broand> looks linear to me

[3:10:01] <Zaphire_Saucypants> gib meh bacon
[3:10:04] <%bevyrage> @ElenaManetta it has the same general cues as the rival early on so far, but no allusion to an elite four just yet

[3:10:27] <%EndlessScrapper> Pokemon is a billion dollar franchise. I don't think they are going to sweat over every monster collector game. Otherwise there wouldn't be Digimon or Persona right? Or Monster Rancher.....I still remember you Monster Rancher.

[3:10:55] <%RubberFistFight> @EndlessScrapper it's not that they won't, it's that they legally CAN'T. They don't own the idea of monster collecting and fighting.
[3:10:56] <%Shadicara> Deserved to die for de digivolving
[3:10:58] <dapperskeleton69> do you think they eat temtems in this universe
[3:10:58] <CriticKitten> omg Monster Rancher
[3:11:01] <cowboydandank> @RubberFistFight perhaps, but the podcast impressions made it sound like they were all much better already, so too bad is all
[3:11:02] <+Winnosh> About to log in and play some of this in a bit. Was enjoying it once I actually got into the server
[3:11:06] <%Laecerelius> Owlmo was born to evolve just to devolve immediately afterwards
[3:11:08] <ape_hawk> there's no elite four, just a Super Cuatro
[3:11:10] <%supercasualboom> Poksona?
[3:11:22] <%cylish> @doc_ock_rokc Not exact for sure, but same core issue. weapons drop with random bonuses and you have to pick them based on your build. Learning the nioh ones cant be too much tougher than knowing the destiny ones
[3:11:25] <%transporterthesequel> This music sounds like the love child of Pokemon and Hat in Time
[3:11:30] <ElenaManetta> I didn't notice, did Owlmo revert in level, too?
[3:11:33] <$notEisiger> I have no idea how Monster Rancher got away with putting in a disc of Nirvana, and getting a headless monster
[3:11:33] <%cerazor01> I think after about a couple hours of this, I'm done. ResidentSleeper Cya guys.
[3:11:36] <+timmc916> revolve
[3:11:40] <+BubbaRands> Owlmo pressed B by himself LUL
[3:11:45] <+Agentoracle> Get owlmo to level 10, log out, log back in.
[3:11:46] <cowboydandank> man, imagine a pokemon game where you evolve EVERY LEVEL
[3:11:48] <SteelC0W> Is Temtem good?
[3:11:51] <Zaphire_Saucypants> here's hopin they aint stuck in that form
[3:11:57] <%ssjklyco> I wonder if they will get an evolve stat boost again
[3:11:57] <dapperskeleton69> temtem is VERY good
[3:11:57] <ShinobiPhoenix> Shin Megumi is beffore Pokemon , but Persona is way after
[3:11:58] <$QueequegTheater> I hope that whatever the gym leader equivalents are, they are better than the pokemon monotype bullshit
[3:12:03] <Zaphire_Saucypants> evolve next level maybe?
[3:12:06] <%doc_ock_rokc> @cylish its more that its ether minor stat adjustments then differing firing modes like with Dys
[3:12:10] <ElenaManetta> I mean that's Elmo, he's always one step forward three steps off the couch
[3:12:15] <%BayowolfTerra> Im totally hearing gym theme notes in the overworld song.
[3:12:15] <+mrpheonix1212> they said the de evolving stuff is some kind of server sync issue
[3:12:17] <%Ninestempest> @AngriestPat put them in the box, take them back out, and if that doesn't work, relog
[3:12:17] <%Laecerelius> High quality Tems here
[3:12:18] <ape_hawk> how long has temtem been in development for?
[3:12:18] <+D00msDayDan> @SteelC0W it's like a bunch of people got sick of pokemon games constantly being shit so they made their own
[3:12:19] <dapperskeleton69> @queequegtheater i hope they dont pull horseshit like healing
[3:12:22] <+Agentoracle> @steelc0w so far it high quality, still, early access.
[3:12:28] <Frodiddly> This music jams
[3:12:33] <Shatterthought> I'm pretty sure that's exactly what happened @D00msDayDan LUL
[3:12:41] <%jemeralddragoon> i am interested in seeing how this game improves
[3:12:41] <%bevyrage> huh, no violin but instead there's a xylophone
[3:12:47] <+wjones0415> man, its shitting all over Sw/Sh.
[3:12:47] <%bevyrage> oop wait there's the violin
[3:12:48] <%NopeBadguy> @AngriestPat Would you recommend this for someone who is disappointed by modern Pokemon?
[3:12:49] <+freakfullmetal2> But Hades
[3:12:50] <EuropanLamprey> "Hey Owlmo, can you evolve?" "DAGA KOTOWARU!"
[3:12:51] <+aslfrasle> @AngriestPat Would Peach "Skaliva" be Paige if she liked Ska ?
[3:12:52] <%Laecerelius> It's more stable than Warframe! HEYO!!
[3:12:53] <foreverN2dust> from what I can see online, if you do something that forces the game to sync with the server (e.i. log/relog) immediately after the evo then it stays evolved
[3:12:54] <$QueequegTheater> @dapperskeleton69 What, you don't love filling a Super Soaker with full restores to fight Lance?
[3:12:55] <ElenaManetta> How would you compare it to an MMO launch?
[3:13:01] <%GarbageNirvana> There really was just that moment you were a ghost
[3:13:02] <mostundesired> Someone didn't play DOS2 in early access
[3:13:04] <KazMkII> The thing pokemon still has over TemTem is human character designs
[3:13:04] <%aishman> @angriestpat In this game exact level isn't what makes em evolve. it's how many times they level under your care
[3:13:04] <Skeletonmanners> Polished? after all the crashes and shadow realm stuff?
[3:13:06] <critfumble_> Hades?
[3:13:11] <+CaptainJax> What about Hades?
[3:13:20] <dapperskeleton69> @queequegtheater no i didnt like chugging galons of restore to fight a single trainer
[3:13:27] <ElenaManetta> I love all the sound effects of this game
[3:13:27] <%cylish> @doc_ock_rokc Yeah I can see that. I had the same issues though. My fix was to not care about anything less than purple and just junk or sacrifice the rest
[3:13:28] <ape_hawk> tthis is high quality for a team of 20 peeps
[3:13:36] <CrabSlacks> Pat is such a good influencer, I'm being influenced right now!
[3:13:38] <cowboydandank> does temtem have waifu powers
[3:13:41] <ShinobiPhoenix> Pat, you were literally in BLackface earlier
[3:13:46] <cyclone722> playing hades right now, it's great
[3:13:52] <%zafooru> hades dropped an updated a couple days ago, it was pretty cool
[3:13:53] <%cvp5127> is hades done yet?
[3:13:55] <%bevyrage> BACK OF THE LINE
[3:14:02] <Zaphire_Saucypants> as am I, Patrick
[3:14:03] <%Laecerelius> Temtem has at least one potential waifu
[3:14:04] <%doc_ock_rokc> @cylish But something might help make big number
[3:14:05] <%mh9s> the latest hades update got some sick new spear aspect
[3:14:06] <%bevyrage> hades still has some stuff happening
[3:14:07] <Zaphire_Saucypants> so totally influenced

[3:14:09] <+Agentoracle> @cowboydandank Pat just fought a mother / daughter duo in bikini tops. yep.
[3:14:11] <$QueequegTheater> @dapperskeleton69 I mean, there's definitely a certain enjoyment to be had in tricking his dragonite into wasting his entire PP into max potions

[3:16:48] <$QueequegTheater> @AngriestPat Level him up once, maybe he'll evolve again
[3:16:48] <+Emperor_Bad> he has that baby forever disease
[3:16:52] <+Agentoracle> @thewe4pon because it's a MMO.
[3:16:56] <Broand> Temfluenced
[3:16:57] <haisho> Owlmo is now Pat
[3:16:57] <ElenaManetta> Maybe you should catch another JUST TO BE ON THE SAFE SIDE

[3:17:17] <%CrimsonCore90> How is the interaction with other players?
[3:17:23] <CrabSlacks> Owlmo will benjimin button himself into an egg soon
[3:17:24] <foreverN2dust> What I do know is that the evolutions are based on the number of times they level after you capture them, so it's not tied to a specific number so leveling again might work
[3:17:26] <ElenaManetta> There's too many gingers on screen
[3:17:27] <ElenaManetta> It's blinding
[3:17:29] <%supercasualboom> Pat, the crazy type

[3:19:38] <ElenaManetta> "If you don‚Äôt rename them when you immediately capture them, you do not have the option to rename them later on in the game. When you open up the squad section in your menu, you cannot attempt to change the name, and there‚Äôs no given option on your screen. " -- guide
[3:19:42] <%GeneralSCPatton> Eri apologizes for hugging your bird after it evolved the first time
[3:19:42] <Zaphire_Saucypants> is it just me or has pokemon fucked up our concept of evolution?
[3:19:42] <EuropanLamprey> Now Pat will be paranoid and check to see if Owlmo is still evolved every 2 minutes

[3:28:46] <Oxybe> Yeah but Epig has Porknite to finance itself, so it don't need worry too much.
[3:28:50] <%bevyrage> IVs are stat scaling on level-up
[3:28:55] <%IMDRanged> TemTem is out of stock? Da hell?
[3:28:55] <%SoySocks> IVs are preferences for certain stats upgrading faster, determined at birth/catch
[3:29:03] <+loukemia83> number from 1 to 50, higher means better max stats
[3:29:06] <$QueequegTheater> EVs (TVs in this) go up by fighting wild pokemon and give bigger stat ups
[3:29:06] <%RubberFistFight> @haisho "so what you gotta do is make your charizard fuck this here pile of pink goo, and then there's a 1/8172 chance it'll come out all sparkly and shit."
[3:29:12] <Vyctorian> IV's are like super nerdy stats like MHW weapon damage differences type nerd stuff
[3:29:15] <mostundesired> LUL
[3:29:16] <mankeytennis> Is there catch chaining in this.
[3:29:16] <foreverN2dust> Gang, please don't explain IVs and EVs to pat, it would ruin the game for him from goblins.
[3:29:20] <Reaverund> High IV's on a particular stat mean that stat will max faster and higher.
[3:29:22] <%Anime_Flux> @Oxybe well played
[3:29:23] <ape_hawk> is he your daddy?
[3:29:27] <%ForlornCarton> each stat has a random value between 1 and 50, bigger is better
[3:29:27] <%CrimsonCore90> @oxybe But the Epig Store just gives crap away and says it's free.

[3:30:42] <cowboydandank> that poison sounds so squelchy
[3:30:51] <%bevyrage> gah, right
[3:30:53] <NinjaGentleman> imagine traveling the world training and only having 2 level 8-9 temtems
[3:30:56] <KoopaPrez> How you liking the game Pat?
[3:30:57] <mankeytennis> Mothra-chan
[3:31:01] <DovaDude29> BEAT THAT BOOMER YEAAAAHH
[3:31:03] <Xelgus> Did Temtem keep Pokemon's natures mechanic?
[3:31:05] <%GarbageNirvana> Seems like there's a lot more room for strategery here
[3:31:06] <%valriot> Oh no, now Paige is toxic LUL
[3:31:11] <+D00msDayDan> double battles were always my favorite in pokomon
[3:31:11] <%Shadowpint> I prefer 1v1
[3:31:11] <InvaderKAZ> Nothing is gender locked I believe so it's very good customization
[3:31:11] <%RubberFistFight> @Zaphire_Saucypants "Notapod" LUL
[3:31:11] <UnfilteredComic> When its balanced for 2v2, yea
[3:31:13] <Oxybe> yeah double battles is great

[3:31:21] <mostundesired> This fucking game
[3:31:23] <%xxinevitablexii> I THOUGHT THAT SAID LOLI
[3:31:25] <ElenaManetta> Pokemon doesn't really do anything with its 2v2 battles
[3:31:32] <%CrimsonCore90> Skaliva has Lupis!!!
[3:31:32] <KasiCrafter> The animation is placeholder, btw
[3:31:34] <LoliKappa> loli pokemon :)
[3:31:38] <CrabSlacks> what is with these attack descriptions
[3:31:38] <$QueequegTheater> Remember triple battles
[3:31:40] <Dutchpotato> It‚Äôs why I wish Pok√©mon would do a new coliseum game, 2v2 was always more fun
[3:31:42] <+fatal_penguin_> Is this Digimon
[3:31:44] <$QueequegTheater> Gamefreak doesn't
[3:31:47] <ape_hawk> what triple battles?
[3:31:53] <dapperskeleton69> @xxinevitablexii well you know what they say about your brain's autocorrext. youre going to jail aonny
[3:31:58] <Oxybe> rotation battles wat?
[3:31:59] <mostundesired> He mlem
[3:32:02] <Xelgus> I would prefer tossing out IVs entirely and keeping natures and EVs instead
[3:32:02] <caesariusmagnum> Gen 5 was wild
[3:32:03] <$realm_forge> @crimsoncore90 it hurt itself in its confusion!
[3:32:04] <%Metballs> Do we know when full release is estimated? I can see myself looking into it
[3:32:05] <Vyctorian> tale that boomer's retirement money, yeah
[3:32:07] <%StaceMcGate> How is this games combat better than Pokemon?
[3:32:07] <%RubberFistFight> @QueequegTheater what about those big 5-pokemon wild battles that happened in X/Y/OR/AS?
[3:32:08] <%bevyrage> AY
[3:32:09] <ElenaManetta> YEAH
[3:32:10] <Darthkitten_Prime> Colloseum and Gale of Darkness were 2v2 and those were great games. They also had proper 3D animations.

[3:35:11] <mostundesired> Gen V in this bitch
[3:35:12] <+thefancywig> it's reduced if you're fighting way weaker dudes
[3:35:12] <ElenaManetta> The bar doesn't just get bigger?
[3:35:15] <%Grayhammatter> when you are above that level
[3:35:17] <ElenaManetta> You need more exp per level?
[3:35:21] <%doc_ock_rokc> @AngriestPat its based on level
[3:35:21] <+Agentoracle> @caesariusmagnum yep, the game is based around double battles.
[3:35:23] <+Papafleish> it scales on level comparison
[3:35:24] <cowboydandank> so junglers are in the tall grass right
[3:35:24] <heartlesshealer> diminishing returns sounds about right for this kind of thing
[3:35:28] <%bevyrage> xp gain is based on level disparity for sure

[3:36:24] <ohgodscorpions> grab pig do quest
[3:36:26] <NinjaGentleman> if they haven't mentioned it they do at somepoint in battle as a tip that the higher your level gets the smaller your exp is. also your vial is a estus flask @AngriestPat
[3:36:29] <Zaphire_Saucypants> @RubberFistFight ye, doin that.
[3:36:32] <%bevyrage> grab pig do sidequest
[3:36:34] <%Grayhammatter> the pig side quest
[3:36:35] <%bevyrage> then dump pig
[3:36:39] <%darthfodder> OOWWWWLLMO NOOOOO

[3:36:47] <ElenaManetta> God it's really fucking nice healing doesn't take 30 seconds every single time
[3:36:49] <ElenaManetta> This game is so fast.
[3:36:55] <heartlesshealer> feed that pig some exp
[3:36:55] <cowboydandank> it's nice that you don't need ot interact with any people to heal your slaves
[3:36:57] <%Cykron> apatGoblin apatGoblin apatGoblin
[3:37:00] <$QueequegTheater> Okay so this type chart is weird. Digital is resisted by NOTHING, electric has 4 that resist but is effective on 4, and there are barely any double weaknesses to anything but electric attacks

[3:37:45] <%RubberFistFight> @Zaphire_Saucypants you can also get anaesthetic/antiseptic spray with a little long nozzle on it so you can shoot it right down the back of your throat. If it's super uncomfortable I suggest that. It's a little more direct than those awful numbing lozenges that make your mouth feel strange.
[3:37:47] <%xmetalicdemonx> This game looks really good.

[3:40:53] <$metzselaar> Best type chart is on their kickstarter
[3:41:04] <heartlesshealer> The description even tells you that it's reliable, that's great
[3:41:07] <ElenaManetta> the TemTem cries are really nice to listen to

[3:42:29] <%Idziman> catching all those loads
[3:42:31] <%darthfodder> I'm pretty impressed with this. I'll probably wait for a couple major updates, though.
[3:42:32] <+Winnosh> yes it is. Same type
[3:42:32] <heartlesshealer> double typing always needs more thought and I love it
[3:42:41] <%bevyrage> wait does gemlo have double typing?

[3:43:55] <%EndlessScrapper> I really hope they reveal the dlc for Outer Worlds soon. I loved everything about that game. Except for the short game time. I finished that game with only one active side quest remaining not even trying
[3:43:57] <%WhereIsWill> dynamic music!

[3:44:50] <%doc_ock_rokc> I kinda hope we get different themes for each area
[3:44:53] <Zaphire_Saucypants> wouldn't dlc fly in the face of what Outer Worlds was all about, thematically speaking? @EndlessScrapper
[3:44:57] <dapperskeleton69> this battle them os actually incredible
[3:45:05] <dapperskeleton69> way better than pokemon

[3:45:23] <%WhereIsWill> taterz noooo
[3:45:26] <%Th33KC> crystal is strong against them
[3:45:26] <%demegodz> Sound design is pretty on point in this game, damn
[3:45:28] <Broand> more like jobberz gottem
[3:45:28] <ElenaManetta> hork hork hork
[3:45:29] <%bevyrage> pat use a revive so taterz stops falling behind on xp
[3:45:33] <heartlesshealer> go go gemlo
[3:45:34] <+ImpHelpSingIt> how is the game yall
[3:45:35] <cowboydandank> i was only paying attention for this battle, but it seems like the violin kicks in whenever you send in a new tem
[3:45:37] <+wjones0415> NOOOOOOOOO!!!!!!
[3:45:37] <CurrySauseBandit> What trait do those lightning bugs have?
[3:45:40] <$QueequegTheater> @AngriestPat They have only one 2x weakness (crystal) and no 4x weakness
[3:45:40] <%Ninestempest> @AngriestPat Ganki is so ridiculous that the only abilities it can get are things that make it actively weak to otehr types.
[3:45:40] <Billy_Bread> How the fuck is this even a game? Copyright law will surely tear this game apart
[3:45:52] <%EndlessScrapper> They have already announced they will have some. I don't mind dlc a long as its expansion type not just cosmetic of items.
[3:45:59] <$QueequegTheater> @Billy_Bread No it won't
[3:45:59] <Broand> nope @Billy_Bread
[3:46:00] <dapperskeleton69> @billy_bread silence pokemon stan
[3:46:02] <BallinArbiter> @billy_bread Pok√©mon didn‚Äôt invent this type of game
[3:46:05] <Quietshun13> pokemon did not copyright catchable monsters
[3:46:07] <%bevyrage> @Billy_Bread it's more than enough legal distinction to make it body any lawsuits, otherwise pokemon would have done it already
[3:46:09] <+CaptainJax> it's not like Pokemon invented monster catching
[3:46:11] <foreverN2dust> Born Tem Die / Kill Tem All 1989 / I am tem man 410,757,864,530 Tem Cops
[3:46:14] <CurrySauseBandit> @Ninestempest That's a pretty sick way to balance
[3:46:15] <%Ixiah> Omg health items used, wtf Pat ???
[3:46:17] <%supercasualboom> @billy_bread Not really. If Chinese knock offs can get away in apps. This game is fine.
[3:46:17] <Zaphire_Saucypants> @EndlessScrapper huh...well then.
[3:46:18] <Dutchpotato> @billy_bread are u stupid or just trolling?
[3:46:21] <%Ninestempest> It's actually really cool
[3:46:23] <%Too_Much_Nukie> @Billy_Bread Atlus should sue this game and Gamefreak for copying Last Bible.

[3:48:22] <+FellowOfInfiniteJest> what is this pokemon shit?
[3:48:24] <%Shadowpint> Is the level cap in Temtem way lower because they seem to evolve way faster
[3:48:25] <ElenaManetta> I'm almost upset that's not its REAL name and it's not a top hat/bug themed TemTem
[3:48:26] <%Aztec50> Patron -> Patrion -> Repatriot

[3:53:05] <cowboydandank> so much violin
[3:53:12] <Zaphire_Saucypants> while the npc designs are a smidge offputting, I'm diggin the aesthetic.
[3:53:15] <+digital_gambitt> @AngriestPat Just dropped in. Yay or Nay so far?
[3:53:22] <Oxybe> temtokens?
[3:53:24] <%WhereIsWill> how ya likin the game pat?
[3:53:27] <dapperskeleton69> @digital_gambitt definitely yay
[3:53:31] <+Papafleish> gemlo wont
[3:53:31] <dapperskeleton69> hes loving it
[3:53:36] <ElenaManetta> i thought gemlo was pronounced like a "gem"stone
[3:53:38] <%Laecerelius> Buy more cards?
[3:53:38] <+ImpHelpSingIt> do they call it evolving in this game
[3:53:49] <+cereal_box_conspiracy> "radical"? What decade is this.
[3:53:50] <Dutchpotato> Maybe buy some stuff with the money u just got.....
[3:54:02] <%Too_Much_Nukie> @ImpHelpSingIt I mean, Digimon calls it evolving in Japan.
[3:54:05] <%Monkeyweed21> gemlo will evolve at like level 30
[3:54:07] <+HollowMan190> really?

[3:54:12] <%Agami23> dont listen to them pat. hoard it like a goblin
[3:54:13] <Oxybe> @cereal_box_conspiracy dont be harshin'my main man
[3:54:15] <marieeebee> Pat is definitely the type of person that says radical
[3:54:19] <%Too_Much_Nukie> Digivolve was invented for the English dub of the anime.
[3:54:21] <dapperskeleton69> @dutchpotato nah he needs all that money so he can become a bougie
[3:54:22] <$QueequegTheater> NEVER USE ANY OF THEM
[3:54:24] <+cereal_box_conspiracy> tubular
[3:54:27] <cowboydandank> what if they called evolution tempowerment
[3:54:44] <Zaphire_Saucypants> radical is a radical word to use, Pat. Don't let anyone shame your radicalnessicity.
[3:54:55] <ElenaManetta> I would love it if this studio ended up being like Klei 2.0 where they release these major updated every 3 months
[3:55:03] <%Laecerelius> Only The Poors spend money! apatBougie
[3:55:15] <Broand> ooooh you can switch into synergy
[3:55:19] <%Monkeyweed21> Gemlo will evolve at level 30ish
[3:55:19] <%StaceMcGate> Is there exp share in this game?
[3:55:19] <Oxybe> Any word used by the super mario world binus stages will be forever relevant.
[3:55:21] <%RubberFistFight> so i just started P4 Golden on my vita - this shit actually looks fucking great for a vita game.
[3:55:29] <%Too_Much_Nukie> I feel like Gemlo is going to be a slow grower. Probably evolves late.
[3:55:31] <%bevyrage> oh hey pat used a different console
[3:55:31] <+MugenSandan> No it must be the worst possible word we could use: Temvolution
[3:55:35] <cowboydandank> @Oxybe even tubular?
[3:55:37] <ElenaManetta> If this is like Pokemon and Gemlo = the starter, then he might not evolve until level 15 - 17
[3:55:41] <ElenaManetta> That's around the standard in Pokemon.
[3:55:46] <$metzselaar> Nice, still got the attack buff even after you switched
[3:55:46] <%Monkeyweed21> Gemlo evolves at level 30ish
[3:55:46] <%WhereIsWill> gemlo foreva!
[3:55:46] <%bevyrage> @MugenSandan Temvolutem
[3:55:50] <dapperskeleton69> gemlo is a grower not a shower
[3:55:54] <Oxybe> @cowboydandank even tubular.
[3:55:54] <Zaphire_Saucypants> aight
[3:55:54] <ElenaManetta> 30! That's a long time
[3:55:55] <%Jack_of_No_Trades> I would like to see that a lot

[4:00:23] <%Derc127> Derc127 subscribed with Twitch Prime. They've subscribed for 13 months! I got nothin this month. Take stream sub money
[4:00:24] <%EndlessScrapper> My first time subbing to anyone. Ive watched you for a decade man. Through my highest and lowest. Thank you
[4:00:39] <DracaenaLeaf> pokemon online were also indie
[4:01:03] <dapperskeleton69> skelmo is FED
[4:01:10] <+wjones0415> true, dauntless did not do well.
[4:01:22] <%GarbageNirvana> So how much is this running for anyway
[4:01:26] <%Laecerelius> Feed Skelmo or I feed!
[4:01:42] <%xxinevitablexii> $35 early acess
[4:01:45] <$joylent_blue> price of a 3DS game
[4:01:46] <dapperskeleton69> @garbagenirvana 35-40 bucks depending on regiin
[4:02:24] <%GarbageNirvana> Not bad
[4:02:28] <$QueequegTheater> DO IT CWARD
[4:02:30] <memeboii00> apatSkelmo
[4:02:31] <dapperskeleton69> pat is being racist to the fire people
[4:02:43] <Neo_Kaiser> lol
[4:02:44] <%Grayhammatter> what?
[4:02:48] <%onlypuppet> Oh my
[4:02:49] <Zaphire_Saucypants> basic bullshit
[4:02:50] <%GarbageNirvana> Pat dont' be a drongo
[4:02:56] <Oxybe> Oh shit Australia is Fire Nation
[4:02:59] <ImmaCanuck> oof
[4:03:07] <hearingthenseeing> bruh
[4:03:07] <dapperskeleton69> is it okay to call australians Burning Men?
[4:03:15] <fojidoj> I promise that makes sense
[4:03:17] <Sol_Install> chat
[4:03:19] <Neo_Kaiser> Packing darkies means to be scared. It's not a racist thing.
[4:03:21] <Zaphire_Saucypants> ouch @dapperskeleton69 Das a burnie.
[4:03:28] <%ForlornCarton> Also co-op
[4:03:29] <$QueequegTheater> Cool
[4:03:30] <dapperskeleton69> LIL
[4:03:34] <dapperskeleton69> LUL
[4:03:44] <%NotGran> NotGran subscribed at Tier 1. They've subscribed for 16 months! 
[4:03:45] <+killer_squid1990> They're adding a nuzlocke mode too apparently
[4:03:53] <$joylent_blue> maybe there will be trading at some point
[4:03:56] <ElenaManetta> I can't imagine what co-op would even do
[4:03:58] <%Grayhammatter> it's in the same menu that the battle was
[4:04:04] <ElenaManetta> It seems like a hinderance compared to just playing alone
[4:04:18] <KasiCrafter> Yeah, the Single Player mode is a legit concern. Pokemon is a single player game and you can't copy/paste it into an MMO.
[4:04:24] <%GarbageNirvana> Wasn't Christopher Lloyd the star in that
[4:04:32] <KasiCrafter> Everyone's playing next to each other, but not really WITH each other.
[4:04:32] <ElenaManetta> he was!
[4:04:37] <%Laecerelius> Each person uses a Tem in battle together I‚Äôd imagine, like Let‚Äôs Go Pikachu
[4:04:38] <Captain_Joe1911> By Pat and Elmo! :) /
