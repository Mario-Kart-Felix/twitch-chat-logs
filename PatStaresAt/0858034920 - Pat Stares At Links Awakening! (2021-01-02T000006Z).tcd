[0:55:26] <%AzureGale> WHAT!!
[0:55:26] <1matheuw> ey great to see the stream is working
[0:55:27] <$DocMadfox> No but shut up though
[0:55:33] <%BoxNavy> does he really just inhale food without chewing?
[0:55:36] <%baka_sugoi> woolieGASM Kreygasm
[0:55:38] <+chiazam> Did I actually make it in time for the beginning of a stream? NICE
[0:55:51] <+corrosivePaladin> thats what happens when you play at 4am
[0:55:53] <SmolBluGhost> he dont give a single bork my guy
[0:55:53] <Grandma_Amari> Isn't that the opposite of true
[0:55:56] <%StrawberryPantsu> Those Dry bits are for later
[0:55:56] <BlueLunecy> Try that memories thing in the map
[0:56:00] <%StrawberryPantsu> He's saving them
[0:56:01] <Profmcstevie> What is this foreign Vibeo game
[0:56:02] <%GeneralSCPatton> Check the most recent memories for guidance
[0:56:02] <%RealThiele> new save
[0:56:04] <%AzureGale> Just watch the previous stream to find your bearings
[0:56:04] <Grandma_Amari> If he inhales them no dry bits will get stuck in his teeth from chewing
[0:56:06] <marvel877> You WERE playing it at like 4 in the morning.
[0:56:10] <+chiazam> Time to make a NEW GAME
[0:56:10] <%crimsonharvest> Pat you're looking for something about 'waterfall' and also 'desert'
[0:56:14] <1matheuw> my cats do that sometimes too and end up trowing up
[0:56:15] <CursedNobleman> Theres also the phone house if youre lost
[0:56:16] <+HiroTSK5> South east

[0:56:36] <yourliteraldog> Pig Boys
[0:56:36] <NitronStreams> The balloon, Gotta find the Balloon

[0:56:43] <silentblast93> like for real can re get a remake of the orical games
[0:56:50] <buckwheat70> Lift that rock!
[0:56:53] <%RealThiele> powahhhh
[0:56:57] <%twistedj3ster> dank
[0:57:03] <+bluguu> nintendo needs more topdown zelda games
[0:57:06] <%GeneralSCPatton> Is that number 15?
[0:57:06] <TallGuyWithAHoodie> I'm not buying this for 80 bucks CAD, but I would totally buy the Oracle games for 80 bucks CAD
[0:57:09] <Grandma_Amari> All hail the magic conch
[0:57:11] <+pectusumbra> I dunno, I don't know that I would like this style for oracle of ages, for instance
[0:57:13] <yorik1> this is the first time I've ever come to this stream and pat was actually playing a game
[0:57:16] <%AzureGale> I HAVE THE POWERRRRRRRR
[0:57:19] <%logoth_> How does a fucking simple game like this lag?
[0:57:19] <%BoxNavy> NotLikeThis
[0:57:23] <AgerOEggers> Nintendo can't into Unreal Engine
[0:57:24] <Saltmeisterr> Its not great
[0:57:25] <yourliteraldog> Link needs to fight against a hoard of ugly bastards
[0:57:27] <OldManDeckardCain> almost as shitty of a performance as yours LUL
[0:57:29] <%twistedj3ster> it's almost like the Switch is a shit console
[0:57:29] <Grandma_Amari> Is it?
[0:57:29] <majindusto> ITS FIIIIIIIINE
[0:57:33] <%logoth_> hahaha man
[0:57:34] <ExpressNode> That new switch needs to come out asap
[0:57:34] <+pectusumbra> has pat done crimes yet?
[0:57:37] <+chiazam> The freame looks fine to me
[0:57:40] <Calek> switch pro when
[0:57:41] <%FacetiousAF> not like its a fuckin nintendo first party or anything.
[0:57:44] <%BoxNavy> boy is it
[0:57:44] <%GeneralSCPatton> Check for a building on the north of town
[0:57:46] <Sol_Install> "a little" huh
[0:57:47] <%FacetiousAF> switch sucks, man :/
[0:57:48] <%ShaneWhite> just a little
[0:57:50] <Grandma_Amari> Start over Kappa
[0:57:51] <%logoth_> The switch shouldnt struggle with a game like this
[0:57:52] <silentblast93> no shit
[0:57:53] <%Ipsenscastle> looking forward to MH rise???
[0:57:54] <pokefan9956> remember that its portable
[0:57:54] <%walternatorz> this game tilt shifts hard
[0:57:58] <ExpressNode> That thing was underpowered at launch
[0:58:02] <majindusto> THERE IS NO "NEW" SWITCH
[0:58:04] <%Alopekis> Nintendo shit is always underpowered.
[0:58:04] <Blank9> this is just laziness on their part here
[0:58:08] <yorik1> switch is pretty powerful considering what it is, which is basically a gameboy
[0:58:09] <+Declan_8000> I think it's more mostly playing things at 60 and then going back to 30ish hurts
[0:58:10] <%linSP> The switch is a dang tablet what do you expect
[0:58:12] <Profmcstevie> Switch skimped out, now even first party games can look rough
[0:58:13] <%greasypete00> kinda weird that its nearly 4 years old already
[0:58:15] <%ShaneWhite> Also PAT Its been a while!!!
[0:58:19] <%GeneralSCPatton> You might want what's in there
[0:58:19] <%the_krypto_knight> I really want to play by rule warriors but it might murder my switch
[0:58:20] <%BoxNavy> i dont want to buy a new switch cus nintendo is too weird about using moddern technology
[0:58:20] <Grandma_Amari> Is there any game on Switch that can manage 60FPS?
[0:58:22] <ChungusQuest> can't wait for the Super Switch in, like, 2028
[0:58:27] <marvel877> It IS a system that was designed with 2013 technology when being first patented.
[0:58:28] <%Solid_Stro> psaBougie_SA
[0:58:32] <CursedNobleman> SwiftRage The Oracle games are way better than awakening.
[0:58:37] <pokefan9956> can they just remake every classic zelda in this style?
[0:58:39] <+TinyLittleDancer> 30 fps is fine for the switch don't @ me
[0:58:43] <Saltmeisterr> @Grandma_Amari most indies
[0:58:47] <%BoxNavy> @Grandma_Amari i dont remember mario odyssey dipping
[0:58:52] <yourliteraldog> I think the switch is powerfull considering its a handheld.
[0:58:52] <%Zundelle> they're pushing the switch to it's limits for the sake of some funko pop artstyle
[0:58:53] <%BoxNavy> i could be wrong
[0:58:58] <TallGuyWithAHoodie> Oracle of Seasons is better than Ages
[0:58:58] <+bluguu> nintendo is a toy company
[0:59:08] <CursedNobleman> @BoxNavy i played it recently, it diped at parts i think
[0:59:14] <%Zeikier> pig fart sounds
[0:59:18] <%the_krypto_knight> 30 FPS is okay if it‚Äôs consistent. Usually on the switch is isn‚Äôt
[0:59:19] <%BoxNavy> welp
[0:59:21] <pokefan9956> its probably just programmed badly. games much more visually impressive run fine
[0:59:23] <%GeneralSCPatton> Are you at 15 shells?
[0:59:25] <%Ipsenscastle> Vita was the true Switch
[0:59:31] <%Ne1son> The little feet tapping is really great
[0:59:32] <%logoth_> Why does link turn so choppily
[0:59:36] <%RealThiele> BARGE TOWN
[0:59:38] <Ell1ot> animal crossing village
[0:59:38] <%AzureGale> Go to the animal crossing
[0:59:39] <%BoxNavy> man the vita was cool
[0:59:42] <CursedNobleman> you need 20 for the L2 sword
[0:59:44] <%Alopekis> They should put Crysis on the Switch
[0:59:46] <%BoxNavy> if it had games then oh baby
[0:59:53] <Grandma_Amari> Link Between Worlds is the only Zelda game I've played lately, this style looks fairly similar.
[0:59:54] <CursedNobleman> was it 20?
[0:59:55] <yourliteraldog> It looks cool in motion, it remindss me little plastic toys. Like this game looks like a play set
[1:00:01] <Broken_Sonex> Okay, who here has actually played their Switch on the go? Who has used the portable function?
[1:00:01] <%SirGO0SE> to this theme "Fuck you, IT'S JAN U ARY"
[1:00:01] <%twistedj3ster> The Vita was powerful, just had a bad libary
[1:00:05] <%AzureGale> Contribute shells for more bio-slime
[1:00:09] <%BoxNavy> @Alopekis they did
[1:00:10] <%GeneralSCPatton> @CursedNobleman Wasn't that only for the original?
[1:00:10] <ranarath> @cursednobleman Need 40 in the Switch version.
[1:00:12] <%AzureGale> @Broken_Sonex Me
[1:00:13] <%Sol_Install> bomb coming
[1:00:16] <%RealThiele> vita ui was aiiiiiids
[1:00:17] <$DocMadfox> Abuse
[1:00:20] <Saltmeisterr> @Alopekis theres actually a crysis game om the switch
[1:00:20] <yorik1> it had a bad library because nobody cared
[1:00:23] <huskarl_zap> animal village also known as animal crossing aka dog fuker town
[1:00:24] <CursedNobleman> ah, 40 now
[1:00:26] <%twistedj3ster> @Broken_Sonex I have exclusivly played it portable
[1:00:28] <%Alopekis> @BoxNavy Wait, really?
[1:00:39] <CursedNobleman> is there anything that helps you find shells?
[1:00:40] <%BoxNavy> yeah dude
[1:00:41] <%Taisuru> Hook shot dingus
[1:00:42] <+bluguu> need more items
[1:00:42] <%Alopekis> Oh shit
[1:00:45] <%Alopekis> You guys are right
[1:00:45] <%AzureGale> Link has had enough of this world
[1:00:47] <1matheuw> why cant zelda swim tho?
[1:00:47] <ExpressNode> I haven't touched my Vita in months. I rebought all my games on Switch and PC
[1:00:47] <%RealThiele> do it again itll work
[1:00:49] <+worldbrand> gaboboboglabublugblub
[1:00:49] <%baka_sugoi> oof
[1:00:50] <+pectusumbra> might be hookshot
[1:00:51] <%BoxNavy> later item
[1:00:55] <%hrbeck_> Do a flip
[1:00:55] <CursedNobleman> thats a hookshot gap
[1:01:00] <CursedNobleman> see the stump
[1:01:04] <%Alopekis> Oh and it's on sale
[1:01:10] <%GeneralSCPatton> That's a different type of gap. That's a hop-down and not a jumpable one.
[1:01:10] <+bluguu> zora flippers and hook shot
[1:01:10] <yourliteraldog> drown
[1:01:14] <Broken_Sonex> Okay so that's 2 people. I see
[1:01:17] <%BoxNavy> :)
[1:01:24] <+corrosivePaladin> time for lv4 dungeon then?
[1:01:28] <DartAran> suspicious lone bush
[1:01:29] <%Alopekis> It would be a shame if I accidentally bought Crysis on the switch
[1:01:31] <jimmytwofeet> That's morbif
[1:01:32] <%Ranryu692> Longshot is better
[1:01:34] <%crimsonharvest> I sort of dont remember the way actually, i mean kind of but its vague?
[1:01:35] <%GeneralSCPatton> When's CLAWGLES?
[1:01:35] <bigshedman> The chiral network isn't up in this part of the map. Gotta connect first before you can build a bridge over that river.
[1:01:36] <%BoxNavy> the hookshot owns
[1:01:36] <%fairore> @alopekis what's on sale ?
[1:01:38] <+Regigangster> Actually the double hookshot is better Kappa
[1:01:44] <%RealThiele> Sproing!
[1:01:46] <%GeneralSCPatton> Oops All Clawshots
[1:01:48] <Saltmeisterr> hey don't sleep on the magnet gloves
[1:01:49] <%Spydurman> god I love this art style so much, feels like playing with toys in the back yard
[1:01:49] <%ShinobiPhoenix> if it's like 3 blocks long, you can just it
[1:01:49] <%SirGO0SE> i think my favorite zelda item is the boomerang
[1:01:50] <CursedNobleman> boomerang is the best weapon in this game
[1:01:52] <%BoxNavy> is crysis even good?
[1:01:57] <%Alopekis> @fairore Switch Crysis which I didn't even know existed until 2 minutes ago.
[1:02:03] <Profmcstevie> The hookshot has always been the "spicy" item, something kinda weird and fun
[1:02:04] <%SirGO0SE> @CursedNobleman boomerangang
[1:02:06] <%ShinobiPhoenix> jump it if it's 3 blocks long
[1:02:06] <CursedNobleman> my favorite weapon is ipad bullshit LUL
[1:02:09] <SomersaultJustice> no
[1:02:10] <doublemasteramerica> Chain chomp is a superior weapon
[1:02:11] <+Regigangster> Is life even good?
[1:02:11] <$DocMadfox> Crysis is a benchmark test is all.
[1:02:14] <%wibbwobbler> LUL
[1:02:14] <wunderkindest> Crysis is legit actually a good game
[1:02:15] <%crimsonharvest> i think its the southeast corner where those shrubs are but that might be unrelated
[1:02:23] <yorik1> has crysis ever been good? the only thing anyone ever talks about is the graphics
[1:02:26] <+D00msDayDan> i like crysis more than i probably should, 1 had a lot of ways to fuck around
[1:02:27] <Broken_Sonex> @BoxNavy The whole series was a tech demo for graphics
[1:02:27] <1matheuw> SNOORE
[1:02:28] <AgerOEggers> there's a tunnel to the south, it seems
[1:02:29] <%BoxNavy> but how
[1:02:35] <Railgun5> @PatStaresAt Talk to the green slime guy near the hookshot gap
[1:02:37] <bigshedman> Crysis is the best predator game ever made.
[1:02:38] <%Alopekis> Now I will have Pokeman and Crysis
[1:02:40] <YeetBoss> pat did you see the new tim rogers video
[1:02:41] <PerkolatorN> Crysis is the most overrated FPS ever made
[1:02:41] <CursedNobleman> BRRRR. BRRRRRRR
[1:02:41] <Grandma_Amari> Just get Godbert Manderville to YEET you into the desert.
[1:02:43] <%logoth_> Zangief falls asleep quickly huh
[1:02:43] <%crimsonharvest> south of the fish mouth there's some grass n shit?
[1:02:43] <+corrosivePaladin> oooh yea this part pogonaSmug
[1:02:47] <%N0bdyNoOne> God that is a lovely, but noisy dawg
[1:02:48] <%TinyLittleDancer> crysis was fun from what I can remember
[1:02:48] <%GeneralSCPatton> Is that entrance on the south a cave to get across?
[1:02:49] <%astrofizzix> Just a little bit south of the seashell house there's a bush
[1:02:49] <1matheuw> that doggo be snorin
[1:02:49] <%ShinobiPhoenix> @patstaresat did you start Tim Rogers' new video? it's just shy of 6 hours long. I am on hour 2 or so.
[1:02:53] <%SirGO0SE> omg his snore is like a sleeping dragon
[1:02:54] <%astrofizzix> cut that bush
[1:02:56] <%twistedj3ster> Crysis 2 was fun until the aliens, the guns felt great against humans
[1:02:57] <Profmcstevie> Zangief is starting to sound as loud as Pat, goddamn
[1:02:58] <+TDotGoat> is that Paige snoring?
[1:02:59] <+AnimeAnimal93> LUL
[1:03:03] <$DocMadfox> @PerkolatorN What about Overwatch?
[1:03:03] <CursedNobleman> how many instruments does pat have?
[1:03:06] <yourliteraldog> Crisis Claim to fame was being impossible to run.
[1:03:08] <yorik1> I've tried playing every crysis and never finished any of them
[1:03:21] <%Ipsenscastle> zelder
[1:03:23] <%Alopekis> They need to put FEAR on the Switch
[1:03:23] <YeetBoss> The new tim rogers video is legendary
[1:03:24] <%Zeikier> one of these legends of Zorlda
[1:03:27] <CursedNobleman> pat cant swim so hes only get 3 instruments?
[1:03:29] <%Alopekis> Did it work?
[1:03:29] <%BoxNavy> zeldo
[1:03:31] <Blank9> Still gonna do majora's mask sometime?
[1:03:33] <%ArtoriasTheTrenchfighter> Unlike Banjo
[1:03:34] <%BoxNavy> theyre ok
[1:03:35] <floornine> @patstaresat Why are you killing all the Giefs in this game?
[1:03:37] <ShichiNoBushi> Slash that bush near the river you kept falling in.
[1:03:37] <kinggum41> goddam this game looks amazing
[1:03:38] <Broken_Sonex> Crisis is one of those games that are fun until the aliens show up
[1:03:40] <ExpressNode> BoTW 100% LP Kappa
[1:03:46] <+CookieCutter007> zelder sniff of the musk is pretty good on emulator
[1:03:51] <@SoFarFetched> Pat's mind goblins might go nuts collecting masks,especially when it comes to Kafei & Anju's questline.
[1:03:52] <+bluguu> do season and ages still hold up?
[1:03:53] <%BoxNavy> when is zelda month on patstaresat
[1:03:54] <CursedNobleman> du du du du du- doo doot doot doot!
[1:03:54] <floornine> 2D Zelda is best Zelda
[1:04:02] <%CzeekyPlays> D:
[1:04:03] <Ell1ot> is this zelder worth $60?
[1:04:03] <+pectusumbra> If you were willing to do bullshit, Oracle of Seasons on GBC is good
[1:04:04] <yorik1> crysis selling point was the graphics and the physics, but the graphics honestly aren't that special and the physics are really buggy if you actually play with them
[1:04:04] <%BoxNavy> die
[1:04:07] <%astrofizzix> No wait! You were there!
[1:04:11] <%GeneralSCPatton> Cut that bush? Might be a cave entrance
[1:04:14] <pokefan9956> should do an ocarina stream along with majora
[1:04:15] <CursedNobleman> LUL
[1:04:16] <+bluguu> hell no
[1:04:20] <+b_aleph> 4d chess best chess
[1:04:20] <Blank9> 3d zelda way better
[1:04:22] <+Regigangster> But $40? Meh
[1:04:26] <+Dives__> $40 seems alright
[1:04:26] <%BoxNavy> @Ell1ot this is one of my favourite zelda games and i would say no
[1:04:27] <%RealThiele> i got my majoras mask guide on hand
[1:04:29] <%twistedj3ster> 20 tops
[1:04:31] <YeetBoss> Tim Rogers new video elevated him from a funny video game man do an actual genius
[1:04:33] <ShichiNoBushi> Breath of the Wild is good, but I prefer the more classic Zelda games such as Ocarina or Oracles.
[1:04:33] <CursedNobleman> SwiftRage MAJORA IS BESTO. BASK IN ITS GLORY
[1:04:33] <+riceking17> I'd love a new 2d Zelda
[1:04:34] <%BoxNavy> just emulate links awakening DX
[1:04:35] <%Alopekis> @yorik1 Yeah but I can jump really high
[1:04:35] <+obeseninja12> I like the 2.5D zeldas
[1:04:35] <%SirGO0SE> 2D Zelda's have a MUCH higher hit rate on being good than 3D Zelda's thats for sure at least
[1:04:37] <ExpressNode> I do think Ocarina is overrated and I played that one the most
[1:04:37] <Profmcstevie> The "games worth 60 dollars" list in all of gaming is barely half a page of paper
[1:04:37] <wunderkindest> I have yet to play a 3D Zelda that I've enjoyed
[1:04:39] <+dramajoe> this is a babies game
[1:04:39] <+worldbrand> it's pretty steep even if you love link's awakening or you've played it before
[1:04:40] <TallGuyWithAHoodie> This would be an amaxong value for 40$. An okay value for 60$.
[1:04:42] <%Spydurman> This is like a $30-$45 looking game
[1:04:46] <floornine> I‚Äôd say $20 at most
[1:04:48] <+TheNewZealandStory> link's awakening is one of the few good zelda games
[1:04:49] <%crimsonharvest> sorry you think the content graveyard that was OOT was worth the asking price at the time?
[1:04:51] <ZeldaAssassiin> @patstaresat oh I think there's something in the village you can do now!
[1:04:51] <$DocMadfox> Zelda nerds are about to start fighting
[1:04:53] <%TinyLittleDancer> It's only 90 in Canadian rubles tho
[1:04:53] <AoiRob> majora's mask best fite me
[1:04:56] <Broken_Sonex> But Pat "There's just so much. God damn. WAITING!"
[1:04:58] <+bluguu> alot of switch games are not worth the pricetag
[1:04:59] <%rumtumtugnutz> This is the most overrated Zelda game
[1:05:05] <%CapnClassix> Link to the Past still best, fite me
[1:05:13] <yorik1> in crysis you can kill yourself by walking into a box because the physics forces on the box can make it accellerate back and forth so crazy that it vibrates lethally
[1:05:20] <pokefan9956> correction. your favorite zelda game is the most overrated
[1:05:20] <+Regigangster> Nobody remembers Minish Cap
[1:05:21] <+Con_fusedDX> SourPls
[1:05:30] <%StrawberryPantsu> @rumtumtugnutz OoT got this beat
[1:05:31] <kinggum41> wait that was the BOTW boulder
[1:05:31] <+TheNewZealandStory> i cant play link to the past without almost passing out from boredom
[1:05:35] <BlueLunecy> Minish Cap is tight
[1:05:37] <%BoxNavy> @Regigangster i do its my favourite one
[1:05:37] <1matheuw> thats sad
[1:05:38] <TallGuyWithAHoodie> Oracle of Seasons is my favorite LoZ
[1:05:39] <%Ne1son> @Regigangster Yo I love Minish Cap
[1:05:39] <the_sprankton> I loved Minish Cap
[1:05:40] <goblinpuppy> minish cap was pretty good
[1:05:41] <+Con_fusedDX> Minish Cap hella underrated
[1:05:41] <%crimsonharvest> directly east of where you just warped from im pretty sure
[1:05:41] <%Alopekis> Crysis is only $17 for the Switch if anyone else wants to be an idiot like me.
[1:05:45] <+worldbrand> i liked it a bunch
[1:05:48] <ExpressNode> @regigangster I actually miss that game. It needs a rerelease
[1:05:50] <+Regigangster> Minish Cap needs more love. Everything else gets referenced all the time
[1:05:50] <+bluguu> minish cap is great but fuck the stone collecting shit
[1:05:52] <+obeseninja12> Minish cap was one of the first I played cuz I used to only have handheld nintendo consoles
[1:05:55] <%SirGO0SE> 2021 the year of 2d zelda streams PogChamp
[1:05:55] <Taclism> minish cap and oracle of seasons are the best 2d zelda
[1:05:55] <%CzeekyPlays> That's because minish cap is cool
[1:05:57] <pokefan9956> I could never get into minish cap. might need to give it a second try

[1:16:23] <AdmiralButtloaf> X+Y
[1:16:27] <+Regigangster> Wait... doesn't that work though?
[1:16:27] <+twohitgood> if you press both together, it should fire bomb arrows.
[1:16:28] <ShichiNoBushi> Press the buttons simultaneously.
[1:16:29] <%AgniBrandt> Press both simultaneously
[1:16:33] <%GeneralSCPatton> Pressing both with the right timing would glitch a bomb-arrow in the original
[1:16:33] <+Taisuru> X+Y
[1:16:34] <heuristicfailure> press them at the same time
[1:16:35] <+EyeFarted> X+Y

Happy New Year to Pat and Smelly 1 and Smelly A, may this year be everything that 2020 wasn't: sane. Pat I gotta ask, have you ever played the Sly Cooper series? I think I replay the trilogy about once every two years

[1:27:27] <%RealThiele> hi eli
[1:27:30] <%ShinobiPhoenix> I thought Pat played A Link to the Past? this is basic Zelda weird puzzle. try going back to Zelda 1. the weirdness was toned down since then
[1:27:30] <marvel877> There was sign for that, though, Pat.

[1:29:09] <%TheLemuroid> Wasn't there a secret ending for no death run
[1:29:10] <JobbedBone> lenient death penalty D:
[1:29:16] <+Genericho> remember kids if things arent going your way just die and you'll come back stronger
[1:29:22] <meromaromiro> Not in the original. In the original you couldn't die once for true ending
[1:29:24] <Onatamana> It's ok because game overing locks you out of the secret ending
[1:29:27] <nivlac_555> bot good enough
[1:29:28] <SirDogBear> The penalty for stealing from the shop is harsher LUL
[1:29:33] <KonekoSilvertail> not quite

[1:33:14] <bloodyheartland> that pineapple looks vitalicious
[1:33:14] <%RealThiele> someone hungry
[1:33:16] <Broken_Sonex> Damn, Banjo put on some pounds
[1:33:23] <Bigyanno> You give the pineapple to the friends you made along the way
[1:33:30] <huskarl_zap> vittles means Viagra
[1:33:35] <AdmiralButtloaf> its a hick term
[1:33:39] <meromaromiro> It's vocabulary
[1:33:40] <ShineTheDiamond> Banjo ate Kazooie and got fat
[1:33:41] <%M3djedx> the biggest yawn
[1:33:41] <SomersaultJustice> everyone in 90s america knew vittles
[1:33:42] <%crimsonharvest> its some hillbilly corruption
[1:33:43] <%GeneralSCPatton> I guess you're supposed to use a dictionary
[1:33:43] <$Jaxnos> he also says he's hungry
[1:33:44] <JobbedBone> name brand Vittles
[1:33:44] <DickieWoodsmall_279> who the fuck eats just a whole pineapple by itself
[1:33:45] <KeiPrime> how would someone eat a pineapple
[1:33:45] <TallGuyWithAHoodie> Vittles is an old timey word for "food"
[1:33:45] <heuristicfailure> Would it have been better if they spelled it properly, as VICTUALS?
[1:33:45] <%Mendin> vittles is an old-timey slang for Victuals which means food/supplies
[1:33:45] <%ShinobiPhoenix> vitamins, nutrition
[1:33:46] <$DocMadfox> It's an Old West one yeah
[1:33:46] <%Alazull> Not really?
[1:33:48] <@commanderclaw> Ask Paige
[1:33:48] <NeroInfinite> Nah
[1:33:49] <%buffaloaff> VItuals if you will
[1:33:52] <%Movemeister> read more books pat
[1:33:55] <%logoth_> This is the song
[1:33:56] <NeroInfinite> It's just old term.
[1:34:06] <bloodyheartland> it makes more sense than zelda being british
[1:34:09] <%Alazull> Vittles probably derives from victuals
[1:34:10] <JobbedBone> vita-meata-vegamin
[1:34:11] <%Ne1son> Victuals is just old timey rations
[1:34:12] <%shurtal> I remember playing this as a dumb child, and i couldn't figure shit out
[1:34:17] <%buffaloaff> Thank God Pats a country boy
[1:34:25] <%walternatorz> ...
[1:34:27] <JobbedBone> vita-vita-veggie mix

[1:34:39] <Bigyanno> Vittles sounds like some rick and morty gibberish

[1:52:32] <%Fooguwu> if only pat had some kind of visual to cross reference as to the arrangement

[1:52:48] <%Buzzard42> if only Pat had taken a screenshot of the book
[1:52:50] <%king_wragles> How long until Pat realizes he mixed up 4 and 5's directions?
[1:52:51] <%BinaryFireball> the dirt says no
[1:52:52] <+pectusumbra> The numbers were the order to move them in
[1:52:54] <therefortomorrow> if only the switch had a screenshot button
[1:52:55] <scizor285> this is meant for children?
[1:52:55] <$Jaxnos> children have beaten Pat once again
[1:52:59] <Ell1ot> i think Pat forgot how to count

[1:54:27] <@SoFarFetched> always sometimes,never listen to chat
[1:54:28] <$Jaxnos> why would you push them in NOT the numbered order?
[1:54:30] <%GeneralSCPatton> IT'S TWO ROWS FOR A REASON
[1:54:36] <LVL1_Scumbag> Shadow puzzles
[1:54:38] <%RetroCop87> 4 right

[1:54:40] <%Buzzard42> PAT
[1:54:41] <%astrofizzix> The number tells you the order to move the gravestones
[1:54:42] <nivlac_555> jesus lol

[1:55:11] <%walternatorz> is that how numbers work?
[1:55:12] <%king_wragles> That's spacial order, but okay @PatStaresAt
[1:55:12] <%Buzzard42> psaWrong
[1:55:12] <%Trenr> so you're starting with 3 instead of 1 because?

[1:55:16] <%TinyLittleDancer> "ITS EXACTLY WHAT I REMEMBERED"
[1:55:16] <%ItsCaptainDisco> This has to be trolling
[1:55:16] <%Fooguwu> yes because 3 is 1 in pat world
[1:55:17] <$Jaxnos> how would you know that's the 3rd one, pat?
[1:55:18] <TallGuyWithAHoodie> Oh okay he's trolling
[1:55:19] <+RaziWraith> Are we getting the rows mixed up maybe?
[1:55:20] <%GeneralSCPatton> THE DATA IS IN THE SHAPE OF THE GRAVE PLOT! THE NUMBERS ARE THE ORDER!
[1:55:23] <+pectusumbra> like actually how do you reach not starting at 1?
[1:55:25] <TallGuyWithAHoodie> surely this is a bit
[1:55:26] <scizor285> you do them in order?
[1:55:28] <%BinaryFireball> patton post it
[1:55:30] <%Emperor_Machinus> 1 grave stone goes up 3 times?
[1:55:31] <%RealThiele> return the slab
[1:55:32] <%BinaryFireball> show the manz
[1:55:33] <therefortomorrow> it was presented
[1:55:33] <%cvp5127> why is it not in order than?
[1:55:40] <%rumtumtugnutz> Pat, sweetie....

[1:55:46] <@SSaryn> Ok fair enough but no
[1:55:46] <%Trenr> ok now try it like a sane person
[1:55:46] <LVL1_Scumbag> Maybe if you keep attempting to solve it the same way, it will work
[1:55:47] <@SoFarFetched> geefBlind geefBlind geefBlind geefBlind geefBlind geefBlind
[1:55:49] <PanicSwytch> Pat counts from 3
[1:55:49] <RamenRiderZ> ‚òùÔ∏èUh uh uh

[1:55:56] <+pectusumbra> it's laid out so you can see it
[1:55:59] <Ookamiden02> 12345
[1:55:59] <NitronStreams> its a map
[1:56:00] <+TheNewZealandStory> this is so cerebral
[1:56:01] <Grandma_Amari> Maybe do 1-5 instead of the order they show maybe, because it's confusingly laid out or something
[1:56:03] <%MidnightBurst12> this is dumb
[1:56:03] <+Damnvier> ^why do you think that when it didnt work twice?
[1:56:04] <%AzureGale> They say insanity is doing the same thing over and over and expecting different results
[1:56:04] <TallGuyWithAHoodie> Nvm this is not a bit hesitant just 1000000% misinterpreted it
[1:56:04] <+Animefreak369> its no bottem left is first becuase its spaced
[1:56:04] <majindusto> Lets see how long he'll slam his head against these Graves
[1:56:04] <%cvp5127> why did it start from 3 then?
[1:56:04] <%Metalwahl> then why wouldn't it be 1 2 3 4 5
[1:56:04] <ChungusQuest> Why would the numbers be there at all, then?
[1:56:05] <JobbedBone> because baba doesn't appreciate it
[1:56:05] <%BinaryFireball> do 1 first
[1:56:07] <%AyotoCorp> If that's the order, which is #3
[1:56:08] <Ell1ot> someone get Paige to help Pat

[1:57:56] <+pectusumbra> That is incorrect. bottom right is 1 then it goes counter clockwise
[1:57:57] <ChungusQuest> but 3 can't be 1 because Baba is 1
[1:57:57] <PanicSwytch> Paige can solve this
[1:57:58] <%AyotoCorp> PAIGE PLEASE HELP
[1:57:58] <heuristicfailure> No. that was 3 4 5 1 2
[1:57:58] <%RetroCop87> Don't worry Pat, if you keep pusing that bottom left grave, it will eventually become 4
[1:57:59] <%za7az> psaBig psaWrong HyperTiger
[1:58:00] <%BinaryFireball> numbers are order, do them in order
[1:58:02] <TallGuyWithAHoodie> clockwise from bottom
[1:58:04] <Grandma_Amari> Backwards probably because Japan is weird.
[1:58:04] <+Animefreak369> numbers are ORDER not LOCATION
[1:58:08] <%GeneralSCPatton> Bottom right goes down. Bottom left goes left. Top left goes up. Top middle goes right. Top right goes up.
[1:58:10] <+Damnvier> NO, from top left: 3,4,5,2,1 are the numbers
[1:58:12] <scizor285> your number 5 is 1
[1:58:12] <+twohitgood> 3 4 5 2 1
[1:58:13] <%twistedj3ster> these boos are annoying
[1:58:14] <+Eamit> the top row is 3 4 5 damnit pat
[1:58:14] <heuristicfailure> They go clockwise starting in the bottom right
[1:58:15] <%AzureGale> Push the bottom right gravestone down first
[1:58:16] <+twohitgood> line breaks dammit
[1:58:18] <AdmiralButtloaf> 1 is the middle bottom
[1:58:19] <%BinaryFireball> SO DO 1 FIRST
[1:58:22] <%spitelite> 3 4 5
[1:58:23] <%king_wragles> Then why aren't you following the numbers?
[1:58:24] <+spitelite> 21

[1:58:30] <%Trenr> but that's not 1
[1:58:30] <$BinaryFireball> 1 is in bottom right

[1:58:32] <%FuzzTime> psaWrong
[1:58:32] <JobbedBone> ONE AT PROPER LOCATIOn
[1:58:32] <Gold13821> The numbers correspond to the order, the location was in the book
[1:58:33] <%walternatorz> that's not #1
[1:58:34] <%Zeikier> isn't it only for the bottom left set of tombstones?
[1:58:36] <TallGuyWithAHoodie> That's 3
[1:58:36] <Profmcstevie> Go back and look it at it, i BEG of you

[2:00:00] <%king_wragles> You have the image, but you've chosen to be wrong

[2:00:31] <Grandma_Amari> Try moving the bottom right one as if it were 1, bottom left is 2, top left is 3, middle top is 4, far right is 5. Even if it's not right I think that's the gist of what they're saying.
[2:00:31] <jcflyguy> This is quality entertainment right here.
[2:00:32] <Ookamiden02> 3 4 5 are top row and 2 1 are bottom row
[2:00:33] <%cervidaequus> DO 1 first, but the bottom right is 1
[2:00:33] <%Piemono> The graves are not in order
[2:00:34] <NeroInfinite> Kappa

[2:00:46] <%GeneralSCPatton> THE IMAGE IS IN THE SAME FUCKING SHAPE AS THE GRAVES! THE 1 LABELS WHICH GRAVE YOU HIT FIRST!
[2:00:46] <%BinaryFireball> the book was a top down view of the graves
[2:00:47] <+corrosivePaladin> We found Pat's baba
[2:00:47] <TallGuyWithAHoodie> This will never be topped. 2021 starting off so strong
[2:00:50] <%barrakuta371> chat is dying, but the earth is healing
[2:00:50] <Vindicato> @PatStaresAt Top row is 3 4 5, bottom row is 2 1
[2:00:51] <+Animefreak369> the location of the number in the book matters
[2:00:51] <+Eamit> next bit
[2:00:52] <%TinyLittleDancer> The music adds to the insanity
[2:00:54] <%Spydurman> DARKNESS ALL THAT I SEE
[2:00:55] <majindusto> THE GOBLINS ARE TOO POWERFUL
[2:00:57] <+Animefreak369> YES
[2:00:57] <%Taisuru> But baba
[2:01:00] <QuestionMarkGames> you need to beat the 8 dungeons FIRST
[2:01:01] <%twistedj3ster> This is compounding on the popcorn kernal stuck in my tooth
[2:01:01] <%Agami23> oh i get it
[2:01:03] <%BinaryFireball> go look at book again
[2:01:03] <%ephie_aka_pulpy> ephie_aka_pulpy subscribed at Tier 1. They've subscribed for 2 months, currently on a 2 month streak! Late to the stream, but I got so hype to see this was the game of the night. I love Link‚Äôs Awakening so much.
[2:01:07] <%RetroCop87> bottom right = 1
[2:01:08] <TheAngryArtist> Ask Paige for help
[2:01:10] <Kylardsa> bottom right is 1 move it down
[2:01:10] <%cervidaequus> DO BOTTOM RIGHT FIRST
[2:01:10] <NeroInfinite> It was also reversed.
[2:01:13] <NeroInfinite> Kappa
[2:01:15] <+Ilpala> SO THE ONE LABELED 1 WAS THE SECOND ONE ON THE BOTTOM. PUSH THAT ONE FIRST
[2:01:15] <%king_wragles> Please, just start at the grave labeled one in the book and keep going to five
[2:01:16] <%Spydurman> bottom right is 1
[2:01:17] <%Movemeister> this puzzle was the storm that was approaching
[2:01:18] <%Payterodactyl> @PatStaresAt does this track get annoying for you after a while or is it only me?
[2:01:21] <%AgniBrandt> 5‚¨áÔ∏è4‚¨ÖÔ∏è1‚¨ÜÔ∏è2‚û°Ô∏è3‚¨ÜÔ∏è
[2:01:23] <KeiPrime> the book was upside down
[2:01:23] <nivlac_555> bottom right down
[2:01:23] <ape_hawk> GRAVE PUZZLESSSSSSS
[2:01:24] <JobbedBone> DO IT
[2:01:26] <dlocke1991> It's not number 1, it's the first one you move.
[2:01:26] <heuristicfailure> the first row of graves are numbers 3, 4 and five. The bottom row is number 2 and 1
[2:01:27] <%General_Terro> because it is
[2:01:28] <%GeneralSCPatton> THE IMAGE IS IN THE SAME FUCKING SHAPE AS THE GRAVES! THE 1 LABELS WHICH GRAVE YOU HIT FIRST!
[2:01:28] <+Eamit> PAT MOVE THE BOTTOM RIGHT ONE FIRST
[2:01:28] <%FoolsArcade> Grave #3 is in the top left space @PatStaresAt
[2:01:29] <%Agami23> thats how the book showed it
[2:01:29] <+twohitgood> first
[2:01:29] <%BoxNavy> AT LEAST TRY TO MOVE THE BOTTOM RIGHT ONE FIRST
[2:01:29] <dinnydanny777> :)
[2:01:29] <Grandma_Amari> Pat stumped by baby puzzle for babies Kappa
[2:01:30] <%king_wragles> That's what the book said, Pat
[2:01:30] <%BinaryFireball> because of the position in the book
[2:01:30] <+Damnvier> it just IS
[2:01:32] <+twohitgood> 1 = first
[2:01:33] <$Jaxnos> becuase literally the bottom right was 1, pat
[2:01:33] <%RetroCop87> BECAUSE THE BOOK SAID SO
[2:01:33] <Ell1ot> because that's how it was written!
[2:01:34] <%damienlunas> Because that's where it was in the book.
[2:01:34] <+EyeFarted> just because
[2:01:34] <Profmcstevie> BECAUSE THATS WHERE IT WAS IN THE BOOK
[2:01:34] <%Piemono> IT'S THE ORDER TO MOVE THE GRAVES
[2:01:35] <%Monkeyweed21> If only you took a screenshot
[2:01:36] <%W1nterTitan> Because the book labeled it one
[2:01:36] <%FoolsArcade> teh numbers directly correlate to the location
[2:01:37] <%StoicMoogle> Try the 1 location first then 2, etc.
[2:01:37] <ChungusQuest> The grave marked 1 is 1st, 2 is 2nd, and so on
[2:01:38] <+pectusumbra> if we're wrong then you can be a shit.
[2:01:38] <ape_hawk> JUST TRUST US, BITCH
[2:01:39] <+bigrocksalt> DO IT
[2:01:40] <nivlac_555> it is 1 because it is labeled 1
[2:01:40] <%BinaryFireball> just try it big trust
[2:01:40] <%crimsonharvest> youre asking why 1 =1
[2:01:41] <Muffinmastr> these arent goblins. pat isnt second guessing himself.. this is just ego
[2:01:41] <+bigrocksalt> PUSH IT
[2:01:41] <%AzureGale> 1 means it's the first gravestone you push!
[2:01:41] <%walternatorz> IT'S THE FIRST TO MOVE IN THE TOP DOWN PERSPECTIVE
[2:01:42] <%BoxNavy> ITS THE FIRST ONE YOU HAVE TO MOVE
[2:01:43] <PanicSwytch> Take a screemshot next time
[2:01:43] <+Animefreak369> its based on the location in the book, its a picture of the grave yard
[2:01:43] <dinnydanny777> I love this version of the main theme
[2:01:43] <heuristicfailure> numerically they go clockwise starting from the bottom right
[2:01:45] <+Eamit> JUST DO IT YOU HAVEN'T TRIED IT
[2:01:45] <+pectusumbra> if we're right then PROGRESS
[2:01:45] <Sowlith> this is fascinating to watch
[2:01:46] <ShichiNoBushi> Bottom-right is "1" because you push it down first.
[2:01:46] <%FoolsArcade> no
[2:01:46] <%BoxNavy> AND THEN GO COUNTERCLOCKWISE
[2:01:48] <marvel877> 54321
[2:01:49] <JobbedBone> you're messing with the natural order
[2:01:49] <Ookamiden02> Following your logic 5‚¨áÔ∏è4‚¨ÖÔ∏è1‚¨ÜÔ∏è2‚û°Ô∏è3‚¨ÜÔ∏è
[2:01:49] <NitronStreams> The bottom right Number was 1 so the Bottom right Stone is 1
[2:01:49] <%AlteisenReiseZ> BECAUSE IT'S THE FIRST ONE YOU SHOULD MOVE
[2:01:50] <%TheCrispyBoi> but baba tho
[2:01:50] <Landedx> just dont think of the numbers and start at the top left
[2:01:51] <+twohitgood> so the fifth grave is moved first.
[2:01:53] <+Animefreak369> the book is not in order
[2:01:53] <%Piemono> STEP 1, MOVE THE BOTTOM RIGHT GRAVE DOWN
[2:01:53] <dlocke1991> It's not number 1, it's the first one to move. Bottom Mid, Bottom Left, Top Left, Top Mid, Top Right
[2:01:54] <%Ne1son> 345
[2:01:54] <%Agami23> look at the discord
[2:01:55] <%Ne1son> 21
[2:01:55] <+justicevi4> GO LOOK AT THE BOOK PAT. STOP BEING WRONG
[2:01:57] <Pyon84> WOW
[2:01:57] <$Jaxnos> i'm shitting my entrails
[2:01:59] <majindusto> DARKNESS...IMPRISONING ME...ALL THAT I SEE...ABSOLUTE HORROR!!!
[2:02:00] <Vindicato> Pat can't let go of what he perceives to be one LUL
[2:02:02] <%FoolsArcade> the numbers aren't an order
[2:02:03] <+twohitgood> fourth grave is second. first grave is third.
[2:02:03] <%BoxNavy> TOP RIGHT IS LAST
[2:02:05] <TallGuyWithAHoodie> There were two lines in the book, like there are two.rows in the graveyard. Move the bottom right one first.
[2:02:05] <SomersaultJustice> I'm happy to be here
[2:02:07] <%barrakuta371> HOW CAN THIS BEEEEEEEEE
[2:02:08] <Ell1ot> but BABA
[2:02:08] <HexMasterMike> There's no conceivable way this is not a joke. Pat is having a laugh.
[2:02:09] <%BoxNavy> BOTTOM RIGHT IS FIRST
[2:02:10] <PanicSwytch> Just humor us Pat
[2:02:13] <+Animefreak369> i wish i could just tell him
[2:02:13] <%walternatorz> psaGoblin psaGoblin psaGoblin psaGoblin psaGoblin psaGoblin psaGoblin
[2:02:13] <+SharpestEnsign> baba
[2:02:14] <nivlac_555> stop thinking one is top left

[2:03:16] <%Zeikier> bottom right down, bottom left left, top left up, top center right, top right up
[2:03:16] <nivlac_555> top left is not 1, 1 is bottom right
[2:03:16] <therefortomorrow> PAT THE ORDER IS THE WAY ITS SHOWN IN THE IMAGE
[2:03:17] <%damienlunas> I just posted the straight up answer spoilered in discord

[2:03:18] <%FuzzTime> but BABA
[2:03:18] <+pectusumbra> Oh my god this is the worst it's ever been actually.
[2:03:18] <ape_hawk> GRAVE 1 = 1ST TO MOVE
[2:03:19] <JobbedBone> ORDER MATTERS
[2:03:20] <Grandma_Amari> ONE IS BOTTOM RIGHT, TWO IS BOTTOM LEFT.
[2:03:20] <Vindicato> Now do it again but start from the bottom right
[2:03:20] <%Fooguwu> numbers are the ORDER not POSITION
[2:03:20] <Profmcstevie> NUMERICAL IS IRRELEVANT, IT CORRESPONDS TO LOCATION
[2:03:20] <%Piemono> HOW CAN THIS BE
[2:03:20] <%king_wragles> The 1 labeled 1... is 1
[2:03:21] <scizor285> it's the order
[2:03:21] <%RealThiele> bakana?!?
[2:03:22] <Octocon> LUL LUL
[2:03:22] <+twohitgood> The Fifth Grave is the first you push.
[2:03:22] <BlueLunecy> THAT ISN'T 5, THAT'S 1
[2:03:23] <Square_Potato> it's not in numerical order
[2:03:23] <%FoolsArcade> @PatStaresAt 3 is not the top right grave
[2:03:24] <%ssjklyco> Look at the shape
[2:03:24] <+PenmanLupine> sweating yet Pat?
[2:03:25] <%W1nterTitan> The numbers in the book were an overlay
[2:03:25] <%Movemeister> this might be worse than Paige baba at this point
[2:03:26] <%twistedj3ster> this is just your stubbornness
[2:03:26] <StuffHunter> Direction does not matter.
[2:03:26] <akitanito> Is this a bit?
[2:03:27] <majindusto> OH GOD DAMN IT
[2:03:27] <%Taisuru> PAT JUST DO THEM IN THE ORDER THAT THEY AREEEEE
[2:03:28] <%rumtumtugnutz> Pat come on man
[2:03:28] <%crimsonharvest> the one labeled 1 goes first pat
[2:03:29] <TallGuyWithAHoodie> IT'S A MAP NOT A LIST (good advice)
[2:03:29] <%walternatorz> You are assuming that first grave is #1 when it is actually #3
[2:03:29] <%Keaton_x> Follow the picture. Where was 1 in the picture? Bottom right
[2:03:30] <NeroInfinite> Think of it as upside down
[2:03:31] <dlocke1991> If the first step doesn't work, then that isn't the right way.
[2:03:31] <%FoolsArcade> 3 is the top left grave
[2:03:31] <filialpails> POSITION IN THE BOOK CORRESPONDS TO POSITION OF THE GRAVE
[2:03:31] <%RetroCop87> this isn't RE for gods sakes
[2:03:31] <%GeneralSCPatton> STOP READING IT WRONG

[2:03:38] <Zebroneath> Gravestone #1 is the first one to move
[2:03:38] <dlocke1991> It's not number 1, it's the first one to move. Bottom Mid, Bottom Left, Top Left, Top Mid, Top Right

[2:04:54] <%BoxNavy> BUT HOW CAN THIS BE
[2:04:54] <%Bane_Kaikyo> NO
[2:04:55] <%wydamn> The numbers tell you the order
[2:04:55] <%king_wragles> @PatStaresAt count to 5 for me real quick, I want to hear you start at 5
[2:04:55] <KeiPrime> THE BOOK WAS LISTED IN THAT ORDER
[2:04:55] <%crimsonharvest> and you start at 1
[2:04:55] <nivlac_555> YOU ARE WRONG
[2:04:56] <%Caped_Eggy> It's ok pat, you don't have to
[2:04:56] <%ssjklyco> With 1 being the first one you do
[2:04:57] <%crimsonharvest> yuou START AT ONE
[2:04:57] <%Spydurman> CLOCKWISE DUDE
[2:04:58] <%walternatorz> IT SHOWS YOU THE POSITION OF THE NUMBERS
[2:04:58] <@commanderclaw> 1 2 3 4 5
[2:04:58] <%RetroCop87> the order in the book is a map
[2:04:58] <%Agami23> pat, the location of the number and direction matter
[2:04:58] <TallGuyWithAHoodie> YOU CAN NEVER MAKE FUN OF PAIGE AGAIN PAT
[2:04:58] <%Piemono> THE GRAVES DON'T HAVE # ATTACHED TO THEM
[2:04:59] <%Sol_Install> it showed you the CLOCKWISE ORDER
[2:04:59] <%OfficioPrefectusCorgi> 12345
[2:04:59] <%FuzzTime> 1 is the FIRST TO MOVE
[2:04:59] <majindusto> PAT HAS BEEN DEFEATED BY BABY GAME
[2:04:59] <Pyon84> You're making up your own order dummy
[2:04:59] <%cervidaequus> 1 = 1 pat
[2:05:00] <%Zeikier> every day!
[2:05:00] <+Eamit> How do you not understand at this point jesus
[2:05:00] <%barrakuta371> psaHoldon psaBig psaWrong
[2:05:00] <ChungusQuest> You were erroneously assuming the order you read them is the order you move them.
[2:05:01] <%ephie_aka_pulpy> psaWrong psaWrong psaWrong psaWrong psaWrong psaWrong psaWrong
[2:05:01] <BlueLunecy> START FROM ONE PAT, NOT THREE
[2:05:01] <$Jaxnos> LITERALLY NO OTHER PERSON ON THIS PLANET HAS STRUGGLED WITH THIS
[2:05:02] <Onatamana> THE BOOK IS A MAP, NOT A LIST
[2:05:02] <heuristicfailure> those are the numbers of each grave
[2:05:02] <%W1nterTitan> It's also an overlay of the graves
[2:05:02] <%Movemeister> I can't wait for Pat to see the vod of this later
[2:05:02] <%ItsCaptainDisco> Was that Sans Undertale and Papyrus Undertale
[2:05:02] <%weissguard> No, it shows you witch graves to move in what order.
[2:05:03] <Square_Potato> position order in book
[2:05:03] <Viaquez> THE BOOK WAS A MAP
[2:05:03] <Ookamiden02> Paige would've get this one
[2:05:03] <%goose_attack_almanac> The numbers are the order in which you do the thing, not the amount you move Pat
[2:05:03] <Broken_Sonex> HIS BRAIN CAN NOT COMPRAHEND
[2:05:04] <%spitelite> you numbered them 123 on to and 45 on bottom, when on top it is 345 and the bottom is 21
[2:05:04] <%Agami23> this is a game for children
[2:05:05] <%BinaryFireball> BUT THE BOOK IS A TOP DOWN VIEW AND YOU START COUNTING AT 1 PAT
[2:05:05] <heuristicfailure> not the order
[2:05:05] <PanicSwytch> Clockwise from the bottom right
[2:05:06] <%General_Terro> NO the numbers are the gravestones not the order
[2:05:06] <%RealThiele> ITS NOT ME, ITS THE PROGRAMMERS THAT ARE WRONG
[2:05:06] <StarkMaximum> oh god i just came back hoo boy we're having a good time huh
[2:05:07] <%coreyyotto> Reminder this is technically a children's game
[2:05:07] <%BoxNavy> IM LIGHTHEADED
[2:05:07] <%StoicMoogle> But who the fuck said 1 is the top left?
[2:05:07] <@commanderclaw> Steel is heavier than feathers
[2:05:08] <ShichiNoBushi> The numbers were in the physical locations of the grave stones.
[2:05:08] <s1rcuit> @PatStaresAt in my limited experience Awakening was probably the buggiest/least consistent Zelda game
[2:05:08] <%Mr_Pylon> The physical location of the numbers match the physical location of the graves.
[2:05:09] <%Zabrewulf_X> psaBlind psaBlind psaBlind psaBlind
[2:05:09] <%Taisuru> PAT, THE ORDER IS 12345, THE LOCATIONS ARE WHAT THEY ARE IN THE BOOK
[2:05:10] <Kemmybelle> that's the locations of the graves, not the order to push them.
[2:05:10] <heuristicfailure> the order is 1 2 3 4 5
[2:05:11] <+pectusumbra> PAT. Take the image of the book in your brain, and OVERLAY IT over the graves. THEN START FROM 1 YOU GOBLIN MAN
[2:05:12] <NeroInfinite> @PatStaresAt Just hink of it as reversed
[2:05:12] <LVL1_Scumbag> Pat, it's okay to be wrong sometimes
[2:05:12] <%Piemono> AAAAHHHHHH@
[2:05:12] <Grandma_Amari> It doesn't lay the graves out how you're imagining
[2:05:12] <%rumtumtugnutz> Cause it isn‚Äôt the wrong order
[2:05:13] <+TheNewZealandStory> how embarrassing
[2:05:14] <%Zeikier> SING US A SONG, YOU'RE THE PIANO MAN
[2:05:15] <KeiPrime> IT STARTS WITH One thing, i dont know why
[2:05:17] <%Zeikier> SING US A SONG TONIGHT
[2:05:18] <%AgniBrandt> In the book, the top left was 3, right?
[2:05:18] <%Monkeyweed21> the book is a map, not a list @PatStaresAt
[2:05:21] <%s_xylocalsingles> FYYYEATHERS
[2:05:22] <%SirGO0SE> LUL
[2:05:22] <+butcherc123> this is a game for babys oat
[2:05:23] <$Jaxnos> A THOUSAND PEOPLE ARE TELLING YOU YOU'RE INSANE ON THIS
[2:05:24] <+Animefreak369> @PatStaresAt if you lay the textbox over the picture of the graves they are in the same location (I.E the text number 1 lays over the bottom right grave)
[2:05:25] <NitronStreams> They were Points on a map.
[2:05:25] <%AlteisenReiseZ> PAT. WHEN YOU COUNT. WHAT NUMBER DO YOU START WITH
[2:05:25] <Daxalog> Accent
[2:05:26] <%Zeikier> Oh we're all in the mood for a melody
[2:05:27] <chimeraxmachina> Chat mad
[2:05:27] <%FuzzTime> LUL
[2:05:27] <%GeneralSCPatton> IT WAS LISTED IN 2 ROWS, IN THE SAME SHAPE AS THE GRAVES. FOR A FUCKING REASON. BECAUSE IT IS A [M A P]
[2:05:27] <%AgniBrandt> That means the top left was the third one to move
[2:05:27] <dinnydanny777> Am I the Wind Fish? NotLikeThis
[2:05:29] <Octocon> pat stares at wrong cheat LUL
[2:05:30] <%Taisuru> The order is 12345
[2:05:32] <Ookamiden02> here we go again
[2:05:32] <%astrofizzix> Imagine overlaying the numbers onto the gravestones
[2:05:33] <%Zeikier> and you got us FEELIN' ALRIGHT
[2:05:33] <%JD_Lars> psaWrong
[2:05:34] <%Sol_Install> LUL
[2:05:35] <%ssjklyco> Look at the shape of the image
[2:05:36] <+dave323dave> this is the worst it has ever been
[2:05:38] <%Sol_Install> PAT SO LUL
[2:05:38] <%BinaryFireball> numbers are 1st 2nd 3rd 4th 5th
[2:05:39] <%Taisuru> NO
[2:05:40] <%damienlunas> The number means when that gravestone has to be touched in sequence. The position of the number and arrow in the book corresponds to WHICH GRAVESTONE IT'S TALKING ABOUT.
[2:05:41] <+corrosivePaladin> Because 1 meant move that gave first. 2 meant move that grave second. and so forth
[2:05:41] <SomersaultJustice> chat, we are in the dream
[2:05:43] <%Agami23> its a map
[2:05:44] <%Mendin> We are all the wind fish now
[2:05:44] <%king_wragles> Start at ONE
[2:05:44] <%Taisuru> 12345
[2:05:45] <%Agami23> no
[2:05:46] <Ookamiden02> starting from 1
[2:05:47] <%hrbeck_> The order is 1 2 3 4 5, the stones are unnumbered
[2:05:47] <+EyeFarted> NO
[2:05:48] <Saltmeisterr> ITS NOT A LIST ITS A MAP
[2:05:48] <therefortomorrow> It was the order for them to be pushed, why is that so hard to understand
[2:05:48] <%OfficioPrefectusCorgi> NO
[2:05:49] <Broken_Sonex> YA WANNA SING ABOUT IT
[2:05:49] <%Daniel_Is_I> FIRST PUSH, SECOND PUSH, ETC.
[2:05:50] <%TheCrispyBoi> 12345
[2:05:51] <%Piemono> NOOOOOOOO
[2:05:51] <NitronStreams> PAT THATS WRONG
[2:05:51] <%greasypete00> 1 MOVES FIRST, THEN 2, THEN 3, THEN 4, THEN 5, i think i understand your thinking but it was incorrect
[2:05:52] <%Agami23> you go to the one in the spot of 1
[2:05:52] <%Movemeister> NOW WHERE WERE THE DAMN GRAVES
[2:05:53] <%AgniBrandt> Pat
[2:05:54] <Grandma_Amari> If you overlay it 21 345 becomes 12345
[2:05:56] <%crimsonharvest> starting with your finger on the number one, which one are you looking at
[2:05:56] <scizor285> stsstt
[2:05:56] <%walternatorz> THAT IS THE POSITION OF THE NUMBERS
[2:05:57] <Pyon84> Why would you start on 3?
[2:05:57] <Ookamiden02> start from 1
[2:05:57] <%king_wragles> @PatStaresAt immediately wrong, start at one and count up to 5
[2:05:58] <%BinaryFireball> 1st 2nd 3rd 4th 5th
[2:05:58] <+Ragnvaldr_AGH> oh my god Pat
[2:05:58] <+Animefreak369> @PatStaresAt if you lay the textbox over the picture of the graves they are in the same location (I.E the text number 1 lays over the bottom right grave).
[2:05:59] <Kylardsa> the placement of the numbers is the placement of the tombstones the numbers are the order your supposed to move them in
[2:05:59] <%Zeikier> pat please never play either version of La Mulana
[2:05:59] <$Jaxnos> take this gun and shoot me, chat
[2:06:00] <NeroInfinite> It's map pat
[2:06:01] <nivlac_555> The 1 is plotted on a map showing it is the first gravestone to be pushed
[2:06:01] <majindusto> THE GOBLINS ARE TOO POWERFUL
[2:06:01] <Viaquez> YOU START WITH 1 YOU LOONY
[2:06:01] <Pookiedaexzile> I mean logistically A pound of Feathers would have more wind Resistance and feel lighter if there was a breeze flowing thru it
[2:06:01] <%Taisuru> The order is 12345,
[2:06:02] <%W1nterTitan> It's an overlay of the graves
[2:06:02] <scizor285> start at 1
[2:06:03] <%Ragnvaldr_AGH> 1 2 3 4 5
[2:06:03] <%Sol_Install> STARTING FROM 1 PAT
[2:06:03] <KeiPrime> no.. go ONE TWO THREE FOUR FIVe
[2:06:03] <%Piemono> 1 IS FIRST
[2:06:04] <%AgniBrandt> What does "3" mean?
[2:06:04] <%Zabrewulf_X> psa2guy psa2guy psa2guy
[2:06:04] <KSGregg> am i being punked?
[2:06:04] <%GeneralSCPatton> NOT A LIST. A MAP A MAP A MAP A MAP A MAP
[2:06:05] <ShichiNoBushi> Show this puzzle to Paige and see how she solves it.
[2:06:06] <NeroInfinite> mot the order
[2:06:06] <heuristicfailure> That!! but start at 1 instead of 3
[2:06:06] <%cowardman93> cowardman93 subscribed with Prime. They've subscribed for 12 months! one year of subbing and I get to say fuck you its January!
[2:06:06] <%AzureGale> Do you remember how you pushed the gravestones? Do you see how the numbers correspond to them?
[2:06:07] <%BoxNavy> pat do you know what a number is?
[2:06:09] <$DocMadfox> Over think
[2:06:09] <Ell1ot> 1 is the first grave you push
[2:06:09] <+justicevi4> START AT 1 PAT
[2:06:10] <%MechArch> you did it
[2:06:10] <%ephie_aka_pulpy> A kilogramme of steel vs a kilogramme of puzzles
[2:06:10] <@SSaryn> I'm going fucking insane
[2:06:11] <%cervidaequus> How can three be
[2:06:11] <%AgniBrandt> Like for real, what does it mean to you?
[2:06:12] <%ssjklyco> It starts from number one
[2:06:15] <NitronStreams> The position of the Numbers is NOT the Order you move them in.
[2:06:16] <%Bane_Kaikyo> NUMBER AND SYMBOL correspond to the POSITION of the grave...... you don't number them
[2:06:16] <%sonofthedeepsouth> cheating
[2:06:17] <dinnydanny777> But Baba is 3 NotLikeThis
[2:06:18] <@commanderclaw> It's a map, not a list
[2:06:19] <Pyon84> It's done pat
[2:06:19] <buckwheat70> It told you what to do starting from 3, but you start the puzzle from step 1
[2:06:19] <%sonofthedeepsouth> CHEATER
[2:06:19] <Broken_Sonex> IT IS SO UNTHINKABLE TO PAT
[2:06:19] <%Piemono> 1ST STEP, PUSH BOTTOM RIGHT DOWN
[2:06:21] <PortableBoredom> I just got here, someone tell me what puzzle for actual children he's having trouble on
[2:06:21] <+Animefreak369> @PatStaresAt if you lay the textbox over the picture of the graves they are in the same location (I.E the text number 1 lays over the bottom right grave)!
[2:06:23] <Zebroneath> The Gravestone labeled 1 is the first one to move in the order.
[2:06:24] <%Mr_Pylon> It's about the position of the numebrs in the book relative to the graves.
[2:06:25] <%wydamn> @ephie_aka_pulpy LUL
[2:06:28] <%bigsteviecool90> the graves were numbered and you start with one then go to two and so on
[2:06:30] <Grandma_Amari> Someone tell Paige Sans Undertale is here
[2:06:31] <StarkMaximum> BABA CEASES TO BE!!!
[2:06:32] <Ell1ot> i bet Paige would've gotten it
[2:06:33] <%BoxNavy> SHOW THE PUZZLE TO PAIGE
[2:06:34] <+Dova573> 5 times 5 equal 35
[2:06:36] <%BinaryFireball> not sure if bit or not
[2:06:36] <+dave323dave> pat still doesnt get it
[2:06:36] <%Movemeister> N U M B E R P U Z Z L E S
[2:06:37] <%AzureGale> Was that Sans and Sans' brother?
[2:06:38] <ape_hawk> THIS IS THE WORST ITS EVER BEEN
[2:06:39] <SomersaultJustice> the screw color blind people dungeon
[2:06:40] <%damienlunas> You basically had it backwards. 5 UP doesn't mean "Press the 5th gravestone up." it means "This is the fifth gravestone you touch, and it needs to go up. "
[2:06:41] <%sonofthedeepsouth> IT CEASES TO BE
[2:06:42] <Ell1ot> What?
[2:06:42] <KeiPrime> youre numbering was wrong, the books was the one you needed
[2:06:44] <%ssjklyco> we can count on both of you to mess up math
[2:06:45] <%Taisuru> Oh gooooood
[2:06:45] <@commanderclaw> @PortableBoredom The color gravestone puzzle
[2:06:46] <nivlac_555> GET PAIGE
[2:06:48] <AthenaAegis> Ah yes, I remember getting stuck like this NUMEROUS times in the original as well
[2:06:54] <+Animefreak369> @PatStaresAt if you lay the textbox over the picture of the graves they are in the same location (I.E the text number 1 lays over the bottom right grave).
[2:06:55] <KeiPrime> good music
[2:07:04] <%Taisuru> A whole dungeon of puzzles hooray!
[2:07:06] <+dramajoe> all blue
[2:07:06] <ape_hawk> OH NO NOT ANOTHER PUZZLE
[2:07:07] <%BoxNavy> uh oh
[2:07:10] <goblinpuppy> This is worse than shadow puzzles. THIS IS WORSE
[2:07:14] <StarkMaximum> I mean to be fair I also didn't understand this puzzle when I played but I also didn't cross my arms and throw a little hissy baby fit about it
[2:07:16] <ape_hawk> oh thank god
[2:07:23] <ShichiNoBushi> This was the dungeon new to the "DX" version of the game and required it to play in a GameBoy Color.
[2:07:25] <marvel877> I bet Pat was very confused about how Kill Bill Vol. 1 began with "Chapter 1: 2."
[2:07:27] <Ell1ot> these baby puzzles are going to defeat Pat
[2:07:28] <+olive_js> How is this game so far? Worth $60?
[2:07:29] <Veluren> So this dungeon literally exists to make sure you were playing the DX version on an actual gameboy color, it's kinda redundant now though
[2:07:34] <%BoxNavy> N U M B E R P U Z Z L E S
[2:07:37] <TallGuyWithAHoodie> Just someone make sure to immortalize the gravestone nonsense on YouTube clips
[2:07:38] <%W1nterTitan> That raised my blood pressure. Good god.
[2:07:44] <NeroInfinite> Paige can't shadow puzzles and pat can't do simple babby puzzles
[2:07:45] <%twistedj3ster> @olive_js fuck no
[2:07:46] <+Genericho> do a flip
[2:07:49] <majindusto> PAT STILL DOESN'T UNDERSTAND lytFIRSTTRY
[2:07:50] <%greasypete00> its the colour dungeon and things here hit hard
[2:07:55] <+dramajoe> this is not a puzzle
[2:07:59] <Broken_Sonex> @TallGuyWithAHoodie ALREADY ON IT
[2:07:59] <s1rcuit> that jump animation looks terribly awkward
[2:08:01] <therefortomorrow> go right

[2:09:08] <@SSaryn> Hey Pat give me 3 prime numbers
[2:09:08] <%Spydurman> @PatStaresAt the numbers were the position AND order of the headstone. Bottom right was 1 and 1st

[2:09:57] <%RealThiele> coke witch
[2:10:03] <%Daniel_Is_I> 1 is not prime
[2:10:04] <%BoxNavy> that doesnt redeem you
[2:10:10] <+HiroTSK5> 1 2 3
[2:10:11] <%Movemeister> 3
[2:10:12] <dinnydanny777> But what if Baba
[2:10:14] <Sunstalker> Skiped 3
[2:10:15] <mx3orange> u forgot 3
[2:10:15] <%twistedj3ster> you can divide 1
[2:10:16] <%Agami23> pat has them memorized in case he needs to make god
[2:10:16] <+twohitgood> 29
[2:10:16] <%MelBrooksKA> @KeiPrime 1 isn't prime
[2:10:17] <%king_wragles> Count to 5 real quick?

[2:10:19] <KeiPrime> ok 3 5 and 7
[2:10:22] <astrophizz> 3, 7
[2:10:22] <+Milpool> 1 is not prime
[2:10:23] <$Jaxnos> it's slowing
[2:10:25] <$DocMadfox> 1's not Prime.
[2:10:27] <%BinaryFireball> 1 not prime daddio but I hate that its not so I will let that one slide
[2:10:28] <%GeneralSCPatton> You skipped several LUL
[2:10:29] <%sonofthedeepsouth> NOW WE TAKE VORKUTA
[2:10:29] <Sunstalker> 67 111
[2:10:31] <%Jekado> 1 doesn't count
[2:10:31] <ExpressNode> 2 is a prime number right?
[2:10:31] <+Joe2187> You skipped 3 and 7
[2:10:32] <TallGuyWithAHoodie> 29 too I think
[2:10:32] <filialpails> 1's not prime, or else the fundamental theorem of arithmetic doesn't work

[2:11:19] <%RealThiele> oh noooo
[2:11:20] <%Daniel_Is_I> @AncelDeLambert A prime number is divisible by 1 and itself. 1 is only divisible by 1. 1 is not prime. This is the actual reason.
[2:11:21] <@SSaryn> Here's 5 subs to count to 5 with
[2:11:21] <%Piemono> So does 25
[2:11:22] <DrBeanie> but 1 can be divided by 1 and itself LUL

[2:13:17] <%Srthunda> thats the part that is a puzzle
[2:13:17] <ShichiNoBushi> You aren't wrong about that, Pat. It's formatted weird in this version.
[2:13:18] <%sonofthedeepsouth> i'm still in a dream. SNAKE EATER!
[2:13:19] <%AgniBrandt> It starts with the bottom left and ends with the top right, which is correct
[2:13:19] <+twohitgood> fully agree
[2:13:20] <%AncelDeLambert> THESE WOUNDS THEY WILL NOT HEAAAAAL
[2:13:21] <+MrSakanaSan> there's only 2 stones on the second row. doesnt have to be a map dude
[2:13:22] <goblinpuppy> Dear god I wish Paige was here
[2:13:22] <Sowlith> I think Pat is right but also wrong
[2:13:23] <%Muffinmastr> Pat 1 is the start
[2:13:23] <s1rcuit> @PatStaresAt start with 1 and push it down, 2 to the left etc. in numerical order
[2:13:23] <%ClericOfSparda> Pat seems right
[2:13:24] <LVL1_Scumbag> Pat, remember what you said about narcissists?

[2:13:26] <$Jaxnos> YOU'RE THE ONLY PERSON ON THE PLANET TO NOT GET THIS
[2:13:26] <Profmcstevie> It fucking breaks into a second row for no reason other than it MUST be a map
[2:13:26] <%TheCrispyBoi> BUT BABA THO
[2:13:26] <+TheNewZealandStory> no it reads like a map
[2:13:26] <%Agami23> but pat, seeing the GB version didnt make you realize that
[2:13:27] <The_500lb_Child> This is the Konami code obviously
[2:13:28] <+Gamblor69> Im with Pat on this one
[2:13:28] <JobbedBone> how can one small man be so wrong
[2:13:28] <heuristicfailure> a row of 3 and a row of 2. no reason?
[2:13:29] <@SoFarFetched> Wouldn't it be in just one row then
[2:13:29] <%greasypete00> the bottom two should be moved over thats true
[2:13:29] <%Spydurman> CANT WAKE UP
[2:13:31] <+RaziWraith> Chat, Pat has a point here
[2:13:31] <%spitelite> i cant be wrong the game must be wrong

[2:13:34] <%BoxNavy> ok pat.
[2:13:34] <Sunstalker> This is worse than Paige's undertale flower
[2:13:35] <majindusto> OK GURA

[2:13:38] <%Muffinmastr> THANK YOU...
[2:13:38] <TallGuyWithAHoodie> Pat doubles down on being wrong even after being fed the correct solution
[2:13:38] <%Monkeyweed21> NO REALITY IS WRONG I AM RIGHT @PatStaresAt
[2:13:39] <+MrSakanaSan> then follow in sequence
[2:13:39] <jacewolf_is_the_best> we're adults
[2:13:41] <%RealThiele> the nomad brain
[2:13:42] <%cvp5127> pat rights
[2:13:42] <%Caped_Eggy> Just a little tho
[2:13:44] <anAngryHamster> Pat I did this as a child
[2:13:44] <%RetroCop87> press X to doubt
[2:13:45] <Saltmeisterr> OK FAIR
[2:13:46] <NitronStreams> Chat... He has a point
[2:13:47] <Viaquez> why would it ever start with 3
[2:13:47] <%BinaryFireball> I think this got 6 year old me
[2:13:48] <%za7az> To be fair, the alignment is off
[2:13:49] <ChungusQuest> this is a legitimate complaint
[2:13:50] <%sonofthedeepsouth> STRANGER I REMAIN!!!!
[2:13:50] <KeiPrime> thats a gb color, not gba
[2:13:51] <Saltmeisterr> BUT U STILL STUMBO
[2:13:51] <+pectusumbra> I see how you misread it, but fucking OOF
[2:13:51] <%GeneralSCPatton> You get back 20% partial credit for this being formatted worse than the gameboy
[2:13:52] <%BinaryFireball> but damn we explained it
[2:13:55] <dinnydanny777> But if Baba is one then why is Baba bottom right NotLikeThis
[2:13:56] <%Mendin> psaWrong
[2:13:59] <%AncelDeLambert> IT'S YOU, BOOK, YOU WHO SHOULD BE IN THIS BOAT!
[2:14:01] <%Zeikier> I
[2:14:03] <%the_krypto_knight> I‚Äôm not dumb, the game is just wrong
[2:14:04] <Broken_Sonex> REALITY IS WRONG SAYS PAT
[2:14:04] <dlocke1991> Pat is right, the text is formatted badly
[2:14:04] <%StoicMoogle> I understand your reasoning. However, you should have experimented these other options
[2:14:06] <Zeikier> yeah okay
[2:14:06] <+EyeFarted> IT'S CLOSE ENOUGH
[2:14:07] <DartAran> Maybe not initially but if your interpretation doesn't work the first 13 times maybe it's something else
[2:14:07] <+krytenkoro> @jacewolf_is_the_best
[2:14:07] <%sonofthedeepsouth> BABA CEASES TO BE
[2:14:07] <%rkbinder> Fair call, its a small tweek that shits up his goblins psaGoblin psaGoblin psaWink
[2:14:07] <@commanderclaw> I think I understand the confusion now
[2:14:08] <s1rcuit> does the dog do damage?
[2:14:08] <%Muffinmastr> at least you finally admitted it but please dont attack us with sanity effects
[2:14:08] <ShichiNoBushi> It could be a single line if it was meant to be a sequential list instead of corresponding to physical location.
[2:14:09] <Profmcstevie> You can't yell louder than the video game
[2:14:12] <%Srthunda> I guess they did not think it would ruin it so much in this remake
[2:14:14] <%damienlunas> Pat is 100% right, the GBA version is formatted better.
[2:14:14] <LVL1_Scumbag> Format johns
[2:14:15] <%oAznoUta> Baba is you can't is you is not wall!
[2:14:18] <goblinpuppy> HOW CAN THIS BE??
[2:14:18] <@SoFarFetched> ""maybe""?
[2:14:18] <%greasypete00> no
[2:14:19] <Saltmeisterr> NO
[2:14:20] <%AzureGale> Pat: psaWrong psaWrong psaWrong psaWrong psaWrong psaWrong psaWrong
[2:14:20] <@SoFarFetched> Its optional
[2:14:20] <+Garrygutterfilth> Ur
[2:14:22] <%barrakuta371> Look, a ginger seeking butt chomp
[2:14:23] <@commanderclaw> no
[2:14:23] <%Zeikier> it gives you some powerups
[2:14:24] <%RetroCop87> Pat, you literally had a whole chat to make up for the lack or formatting
[2:14:24] <Veluren> 100% optional but a very worthwhile reward
[2:14:25] <Saltmeisterr> ITS EXTRA CONTENT
[2:14:25] <+Ilpala> no it's strictly optional for bonus buff
[2:14:26] <$KnivesEve> GBA? You mean GBC
[2:14:26] <%damienlunas> Color dungeon is optional but it gives you GOOD SHIT
[2:14:26] <Ell1ot> my 12 year old niece was yelling at you the whole time at the grave puzzle
[2:14:26] <%BoxNavy> nah
[2:14:26] <Broken_Sonex> YOU ARE. YOU ARE VERY STUPID
[2:14:26] <StarkMaximum> No it's bonus
[2:14:26] <%Monkeyweed21> WHAT
[2:14:27] <NitronStreams> Between that and "Streamer Tax" I'll give Pat this one
[2:14:27] <%AgniBrandt> It is purely optional
[2:14:27] <%RealThiele> no but its cool
[2:14:27] <s1rcuit> I would assume it is since it's a dungeon
[2:14:27] <JobbedBone> its not but its good
[2:14:28] <majindusto> DO IT THO
[2:14:28] <%bigsteviecool90> no it is not
[2:14:29] <%Jekado> its option it unlocks something i think
[2:14:29] <dinnydanny777> Worth it
[2:14:29] <%StrawberryPantsu> Pat literally dumber than a child
[2:14:29] <%GeneralSCPatton> You still refused to understand repeated explanations that flew in the face of your assumed misconceptions.
[2:14:30] <%General_Terro> it gives you magic clothes
[2:14:30] <KeiPrime> color dungeon is optional
[2:14:30] <%LeiaSkynoober> You get a neat thing from the colour dungeon
[2:14:30] <%BoxNavy> you get a good thing for it
[2:14:31] <+pectusumbra> It is not the path forward but it is something now
[2:14:31] <%AgniBrandt> But you get some GOOD shit
[2:14:31] <Blank9> it's what they added to the DX version
[2:14:32] <%TheLemuroid> Colour dungeon is an extra
[2:14:33] <TallGuyWithAHoodie> is super not
[2:14:34] <+pectusumbra> *nice
[2:14:34] <heuristicfailure> progress in any direction is still progress
[2:14:35] <%VoidBaronJules> np, it was an extra dungeon for the gameboy colour
[2:14:35] <Kemmybelle> nope. it's bonus
[2:14:36] <+RaziWraith> Color dungeon is optional but it is good ups.
[2:14:38] <%TinyLittleDancer> You got it wrong like three times after seeing the GBA version, don't play it off now
[2:14:38] <%Zeikier> you can get a thing that gets you double ATK or double DEF
[2:14:40] <Saltmeisterr> talk to marin
[2:14:41] <%Taisuru> It gives you a stat boost
[2:14:41] <%sonofthedeepsouth> MAYBE?
[2:14:42] <%GeneralSCPatton> The color dungeon will get you permanent double damage
[2:14:43] <%za7az> It is for fashion souls :)
[2:14:46] <KeiPrime> path forward is find marin and take her to the animal village
[2:14:48] <%bigsteviecool90> optional but good reward
[2:14:49] <%Muffinmastr> race war dungeon
[2:14:50] <%RetroCop87> THE COLOR DUNGEON ADDRESSES ONE OF YOUR EARLIER COMPLAINTS
[2:14:52] <+Ilpala> go pick up your girl
[2:14:56] <%RetroCop87> whoops, capslock
[2:15:00] <majindusto> YOU WANT WHAT THE DUNGEON HAS THO
[2:15:00] <+pectusumbra> You have to find marin and take her to wake up a fat sleepy boy
[2:15:01] <ExpressNode> Man this stream has been one wild ride
[2:15:01] <%BoxNavy> chat did you have trouble with this versions grave puzzle?
[2:15:07] <%rekinom> rekinom subscribed with Prime. They've subscribed for 2 months! I had to contact amazon support to get it to let me use my prime sub bullshit. ANYWAY, have you ever played Lisa? Would highly recommend it!
[2:15:08] <s1rcuit> It was the butterflies
[2:15:08] <%ShinobiPhoenix> @PatStaresAt no, it's permanent buffs, after you've just been complaining about the temporary ones
[2:15:09] <Kghaleon> When I played the original on gameboy when I was 10 I thankfully had a strategy guide for that bullshit
[2:15:09] <ShichiNoBushi> Color Dungeon is 100% optional. You just get choice between red or blue tunics when you beat it (red=damage; blue=defense)
[2:15:11] <%Monkeyweed21> you have to find your side squeeze
[2:15:13] <$Jaxnos> nope
[2:15:16] <ape_hawk> is pat not gonna do the color dungon?
[2:15:21] <KeiPrime> take marin to the trendy game
[2:15:27] <Saltmeisterr> LETTER
[2:15:28] <StarkMaximum> @BoxNavy Yes but when I figured it out I went "aha, there we go" and not "the game must be wrong!!"
[2:15:29] <Saltmeisterr> BLIND
[2:15:36] <KeiPrime> letter on DEsk
[2:15:37] <NitronStreams> He's looking for the way to progress
[2:15:39] <$DocMadfox> I might actually need to tap out.
[2:15:43] <jacewolf_is_the_best> he's like a little santa's helper
[2:15:50] <%BoxNavy> she is hiding from you
[2:15:51] <s1rcuit> is that a button?
[2:15:54] <@SSaryn> Holy shit I'm looking at both versions yeah he's not wrong. Shit's weird.
[2:15:55] <KeiPrime> table
[2:15:55] <ShichiNoBushi> I don't recall if anyone actually tells you where Marin is right now.
[2:15:56] <%GeneralSCPatton> Ask around
[2:15:56] <Vindicato> omg
[2:15:57] <%ShinobiPhoenix> though, quite frankly, you should only get Blue... Red kind of breaks the game
[2:16:00] <Saltmeisterr> BLIND.
[2:16:02] <+pectusumbra> oh, yeah, on the table there's a paper, that's a hint
[2:16:08] <s1rcuit> @PatStaresAt I think there was a button in there
[2:16:15] <%Monkeyweed21> psaBlind psaBlind psaBlind
[2:16:22] <StarkMaximum> that's not a button that's a stand for a figure
[2:16:24] <ancrest_tant> I‚Äôm back. Did Pat understand the tombstones after ‚Äúsolving‚Äù it?
[2:16:26] <%ShinobiPhoenix> I did the color dungeon puzzle EXACTLY based on teh book's instructions
[2:16:32] <Broken_Sonex> "Feel"
[2:16:37] <%BoxNavy> i dont blame you for that
[2:16:38] <Zebens> LIL
[2:16:38] <RamenRiderZ> Bonk at the Beach
[2:16:38] <Northward12> no
[2:16:39] <ShichiNoBushi> Very subtle and missable.
[2:16:41] <%LeiaSkynoober> Marin's going black profile picture
[2:16:43] <%ShinobiPhoenix> @ancrest_tant no
[2:16:45] <NitronStreams> I'm assuming Pat's brain is a little fried at the moment
[2:16:46] <$DocMadfox> You also refuse to read the sign that gives you the hint to look for hidden tunnels, so.
[2:16:48] <jacewolf_is_the_best> i like this
[2:16:50] <%Monkeyweed21> @ancrest_tant he refuses to accept that he was wrong
[2:16:52] <%AzureGale> Gon' do it on the beach
[2:16:55] <Saltmeisterr> ur not
[2:16:57] <@SoFarFetched> You also shat yourself and had to get new diapers
[2:16:58] <StarkMaximum> @LeiaSkynoober Ina play Unravel
[2:16:59] <%king_wragles> Sure Pat, let's get you to bed
[2:17:00] <ape_hawk> yes you are
[2:17:02] <Pyon84> I think you were fair
[2:17:04] <goblinpuppy> Stupidity is not a mental ilness
[2:17:04] <%GeneralSCPatton> @ancrest_tant It took extra time for him to figure out. He still blames the Switch version for centering the bottom row, which is kind of fair.
[2:17:07] <%Zeikier> yes pat
[2:17:12] <%Muffinmastr> more stubborn than sleepy.
[2:17:12] <%Maids4lyfe> lmao
[2:17:14] <Profmcstevie> At least you could have stared at it and maybe it'd click
[2:17:16] <%valcheese> and you would still be wrong
[2:17:18] <%BoxNavy> OH NOOOOO
[2:17:19] <@SSaryn> Yeah I can see that.
[2:17:20] <Ookamiden02> LUL
[2:17:20] <Profmcstevie> Cos I'm not trusting Pat mind
[2:17:20] <%Zeikier> FIGHT ME AT YOUR FULL STRENGTH
[2:17:21] <%king_wragles> Please, I'm sorry to spam this. But please just count to 5 for me
[2:17:21] <%BoxNavy> HES RIGHT
[2:17:22] <%ShinobiPhoenix> I had zero trouble using the book's instructions
[2:17:23] <%TinyLittleDancer> You are crazy and doubling down. You're just making excuses
[2:17:23] <%Ne1son> You are very crazy
[2:17:24] <%Monkeyweed21> ok boomer
[2:17:24] <%Caped_Eggy> RAGNAROK
[2:17:25] <%StormBuster24> That's difficult to believe : p
[2:17:25] <%TheLemuroid> yeah its the interpretation that was off
[2:17:26] <KeiPrime> how is that possible
[2:17:29] <%sonofthedeepsouth> not crazy btw
[2:17:30] <%za7az> PogChamp
[2:17:31] <%AzureGale> ok
[2:17:32] <%Muffinmastr> we get it you dont ever admit you're wrong!
[2:17:33] <%Daniel_Is_I> Pat dying on a hill? Naaaaaah
[2:17:36] <marvel877> Pat, you have a screenshot button on the Switch
[2:17:37] <ape_hawk> IM CALLING NINTENDO RIGHT NOW TO CORRECT THIS ERROR IN A PATCH
[2:17:37] <Broken_Sonex> YOU WOULD HAVE LOST HARDER
[2:17:39] <%Monkeyweed21> REALITY IS WRONG I AM RIGHT @PatStaresAt
[2:17:40] <s1rcuit> @PatStaresAt I think the problem (granted I got here late) was that you focused on the order like you would read something
[2:17:45] <jumpyhugs> not crazy, just dumb and overthinking
[2:17:47] <Grandma_Amari> Crazy Talk make Pat's assumption of the puzzle's layout wrong.
[2:17:48] <%king_wragles> psaWrong psaWrong psaWrong psaWrong
[2:17:51] <ancrest_tant> So right on brand, got it
[2:17:53] <Pookiedaexzile> What does Nintendo know about game design anyway
[2:17:55] <%SirGO0SE> like how he admits hes wrong about Rare :)
[2:17:56] <%ShinobiPhoenix> I haven't played the GB version in years and just assumed teh game would have changed the puzzle from the original
[2:17:56] <%GeneralSCPatton> Doubling down harder than a flat-earther measuring a 15 degree per hour drift
[2:17:57] <KeiPrime> need an item here for this guy way later
[2:17:58] <majindusto> WE WOULD FIGHT YOU MORE TOO
[2:18:00] <+Ilpala> so what you're saying is this puzzle was the mesh'kan door and the game was woolie
[2:18:01] <nivlac_555> call Miyamoto and demand he patch it
[2:18:01] <%Ne1son> I'm not owned, i'm not owned yelled Pat into the either
[2:18:02] <%BoxNavy> this is a thing for later
[2:18:03] <%linSP> Not yet
[2:18:06] <%TinyLittleDancer> "Ooh the kerning was off ... Therefore I was completely right" come on
[2:18:14] <Pookiedaexzile> No like literally tho, its not a company of miyomotos
[2:18:14] <greatspaceadventure> hi pat, hi chat. random fun fact: i started my very first run of the original Demon's Souls today
[2:18:14] <%Muffinmastr> yeah you admitted it, took you long enough rubrLUL
[2:18:18] <jacewolf_is_the_best> impale her
[2:18:20] <%ShinobiPhoenix> DATE TIME
[2:18:21] <%BoxNavy> :)
[2:18:21] <%damienlunas> Pat is 100% right that the Gameboy version is way easier to understand than the Switch version. If you disagree then you're the one who can't admit that you're wrong. psaSmug
[2:18:21] <ape_hawk> game designers that use subtext are cowards
[2:18:22] <%Monkeyweed21> she wants the sex
[2:18:24] <KeiPrime> marin time
[2:18:25] <%AzureGale> Stay a while and listen

[2:18:28] <%LeiaSkynoober> God Marin ily
[2:18:29] <yourliteraldog> Slam her preggo
[2:18:31] <StarkMaximum> Pat seems like the kind of person who gets told a ridle, he gives his answer, and when he's told "no this is the answer" he goes "no but mine was also right tho"
[2:18:34] <Broken_Sonex> Time to fuck
[2:18:34] <%ssjklyco> Now kiss
[2:18:35] <%Clarke1010> Why pat always getting the hot red heads

[2:19:10] <%GeneralSCPatton> You still double-downed way too hard on a method that clearly wasn't working. That shit is why I never finished Woolie's Baba vids. Because he decided reality was wrong instead.

[2:19:57] <dinnydanny777> LITERAL OBJECT
[2:19:58] <ShichiNoBushi> Take her to the crane game.
[2:19:59] <+twohitgood> big chance for what?
[2:19:59] <%ShinobiPhoenix> @damienlunas Easier to understand (subjective) doesn't change not understanding the Switch version. Most people didn't even play the GB version or haven't for years or look up guides and understood it perfectly fine based on the clues given in game
[2:19:59] <%sonofthedeepsouth> GOT HER
[2:20:00] <KosOrSomeSayKosm_> obtained [W O M A N]
[2:20:00] <@Mechz71> @PatStaresAt Which one is Zelda

[2:20:15] <Pookiedaexzile> ASSESSORY
[2:20:16] <Mangahero18> Pat is good with Math, just not Logic.
[2:20:17] <ancrest_tant> Women are objects says Nintendo
[2:20:18] <+pectusumbra> You know what? Of course Pat didn't do well with the gravestones. It's a SLIDING PUZZLE
[2:20:19] <TheHotStuven> CoolCat WOMAN GET CoolCat
[2:20:19] <Broken_Sonex> LINK IS IN
[2:20:20] <%Zeikier> yah we're not all good at handling every kind of puzzle, some come better than others
[2:20:20] <KeiPrime> dig with marin
[2:20:20] <%linSP> Big smart pat
[2:20:26] <Zebens> missed cutscene
[2:20:27] <%Zeikier> it's EXACTLY FINE PAT
[2:20:31] <@commanderclaw> I actually agree, the remake botched it
[2:20:31] <%za7az> You're right Pat
[2:20:32] <%Sol_Install> He's still going on this huh
[2:20:33] <$Jaxnos> but everyone else thinks it's a map
[2:20:33] <nauskills> Ahhh link, I think it's your AAARHHG that got me ‚ù§Ô∏è
[2:20:34] <%Piemono> Oh give it up man, it wasn't hard
[2:20:36] <%BoxNavy> ok
[2:20:37] <Pyon84> Yea, doesn't look like a map
[2:20:37] <%Monkeyweed21> psaGoblin psaGoblin psaGoblin
[2:20:38] <dinnydanny777> Why is the music like this after obtaining Marin LUL
[2:20:38] <KeiPrime> TRENDY GAME
[2:20:38] <@SoFarFetched> geefPlz can't wait for this be on the podcast
[2:20:39] <%Spydurman> cry harder Pat LUL
[2:20:41] <Profmcstevie> It cuts to a second row for no reason OTHER than it's intentionally relative LIKE A MAP
[2:20:42] <%sighphers> nah, you just doubled-down on reading order
[2:20:42] <%Muffinmastr> yeah, i dont think thatd be my first impression eitherr ahah
[2:20:42] <marvel877> Check your twitter
[2:20:44] <$Jaxnos> i never played the original
[2:20:46] <%AyotoCorp> CRANE GAME
[2:20:46] <%AlteisenReiseZ> Take her to the Trendy Game!
[2:20:46] <ShichiNoBushi> Failure on Nintendo's part, in this case.
[2:20:48] <%Zeikier> maybe if this game knew how to triforce it'd be less n00b
[2:20:48] <ape_hawk> guys, this is gonna be on the podcast
[2:20:51] <%linSP> Try murdering a Cucco with marin
[2:20:51] <dd44dostivei> but why would the stones be numbered that way
[2:20:53] <KeiPrime> T R E n D y G a M e
[2:20:54] <+RaziWraith> @PatStaresAt but how else would you know which ones to push and which order?
[2:20:55] <%Spydurman> BabyRage
[2:20:56] <%RetroCop87> ONLY TO RILE YOU UP
[2:20:56] <%wibbwobbler> LUL
[2:20:58] <%SomeSageAdvice> @PatStaresAt if you wanna see something funny, attack the chickens until Marin says something interesting
[2:20:59] <%king_wragles> Ya, cause "I admit I'm wrong all the time" man won't admit he was wrong
[2:21:00] <ExpressNode> Is this a known issue?
[2:21:01] <%coreyyotto> Weird that the developers of Zelda can't triforce
[2:21:02] <%ShinobiPhoenix> if you never looked up guides or try to compare to the original, you have no reason to claim it's "formatted" "better"
[2:21:02] <Broken_Sonex> WOMEN GOT
[2:21:02] <%LeiaSkynoober> Steal with Marin!
[2:21:08] <%GeneralSCPatton> We were clearly trying to convey a method to you that was completely counter to what you already tried. And you actively avoided trying anything different.
[2:21:09] <StarkMaximum> Puzzle in a video game: Is obtuse to make it more difficult to figure out. Pat: BUT THAT'S INCORRECT
[2:21:11] <%weissguard> @SoFarFetched This podcast bit will be great
[2:21:11] <%Agami23> the real puzzle is how quickly can you break the games framerate by destroying grass
[2:21:13] <+cgreene64> I like the focal length on the camera in this game
[2:21:16] <%Spydurman> BabyRage BabyRage BabyRage BabyRage IT WAS FORMATTED WRONG LUL
[2:21:16] <%Monkeyweed21> Is this a bit? @PatStaresAt
[2:21:18] <s1rcuit> that village is super dangerous, it's beset on all sides by monsters
[2:21:19] <yourliteraldog> Take her to pound town
[2:21:20] <+fatmac1616> Hi
[2:21:26] <+fatmac1616> Love this game
[2:21:27] <%RealThiele> LUL
[2:21:32] <StarkMaximum> Pat would you have preferred it if the book literally just said "hey, here's how you get into the color dungeon"
[2:21:32] <%linSP> Bruh Marin is a psycho bitch
[2:21:33] <%SirGO0SE> he did
[2:21:34] <%king_wragles> @PatStaresAt fuck, you actually got me
[2:21:39] <%BoxNavy> NICE
[2:21:42] <NenaFan101> @PatStaresAt Will you play Banjo-Tooie?
[2:21:44] <Mangahero18> Also, Marin DOES turn into a seagull when you wake up the windfish and every dies. Thats the end of this game. You wake up a dumb fish and all the fake people just fucking die and your waifu turns into a Seagull.
[2:21:44] <%Mendin> DKC Apology Stream When
[2:21:45] <+twohitgood> tropical freeze has a great OST

[2:22:06] <%StrawberryPantsu> Forest Interlude>>> Aquatic Ambiance
[2:22:06] <akitanito> don't you thrive on that though?
[2:22:07] <+Birdigalore> That's fair. Old Rare music is a lot different than the clown fart noises of N64 Rare
[2:22:07] <%twistedj3ster> @Mangahero18 stfu
[2:22:08] <%rekinom> psaDogchamp
[2:22:08] <Explodincatz> because your asking for it

[2:22:10] <%Emperor_Machinus> Why must Pat wear targets wherever he goes?
[2:22:10] <+Gamblor69> The only winning move is to not play or some BS like that
[2:22:10] <biomegabear> Donkey kong classic go up but banjo fans go down. Pat cant handle social links with chat
[2:22:11] <LVL1_Scumbag> Yes Pat, you're always the victim
[2:22:12] <%Ne1son> But you were wrong about the puzzle though

[2:22:43] <%Taisuru> It's LITTERALLY built to fool you
[2:22:44] <majindusto> lol
[2:22:44] <%BoxNavy> yeah dude
[2:22:44] <dinnydanny777> PogChamp Banger
[2:22:47] <+twohitgood> gangplank galleon absolutely is built to fool you.
[2:22:49] <Profmcstevie> It's for a boss fight, it is SUPPOSED to kind of throw you off
[2:22:49] <%RetroCop87> it's literally built to trick you in the boss battle
[2:22:50] <%Zeikier> yeah, SNES soundchip is pretty heinous most of the time
[2:22:51] <nauskills> Yeah
[2:22:53] <%oAznoUta> it's because it's a pirate ship you dingus
[2:22:53] <filialpails> PIRATE SHIT
[2:22:54] <%Taisuru> It fools you in game as well
[2:22:58] <biomegabear> 15?!
[2:22:58] <+MisterAvry> it's a cartoony game about banana lovin monkeys
[2:23:00] <%SirGO0SE> clownpenis.wav into bigbanger.flac
[2:23:01] <Blank9> why would woolie say to listen to a bad ac black flag instrumental sea shanty?
[2:23:01] <%StrawberryPantsu> Mother Fucker you're a clown
[2:23:01] <Pookiedaexzile> Clownshoes ass shit
[2:23:03] <Heroes_of_Vale> uxieuFacepalm uxieuFacepalm uxieuFacepalm uxieuFacepalm
[2:23:04] <%linSP> The final battle is a jape
[2:23:04] <+Birdigalore> GOTTA WAIT FOR THE DROP
[2:23:05] <KeiPrime> yeah cause when you get to the real boss, ideally, the real song starts
[2:23:09] <+pectusumbra> It's a final boss fight on a pirate ship yes
[2:23:09] <Saltmeisterr> PAT WHAT DOES THAT EVEN MEAN?
[2:23:10] <StarkMaximum> Yeah Pat it's almost like that's the entire point
[2:23:10] <Mangahero18> You should listen to the metal remix of that track.
[2:23:11] <%sonofthedeepsouth> TAILS GET TROLLED
[2:23:12] <%BoxNavy> no woolie knows
[2:23:12] <%Zeikier> but how is Crocodile Cacophony?
[2:23:13] <+Dova573> nah he does
[2:23:16] <%sonofthedeepsouth> PAT GETS TROLLED
[2:23:17] <@commanderclaw> Trolled by Daivd Wise 25 years later
[2:23:18] <%BoxNavy> its why the song is so cool
[2:23:18] <%Mendin> Patgliacci the Clown
[2:23:19] <Broken_Sonex> Woolie doesn't care about this stupid shit.
[2:23:19] <%ggbhtg> IT LITERALLY IS A TROLL, the game also rolls fake credits @patstaresat
[2:23:25] <%Zeikier> SNES does horns like friggin garbage
[2:23:26] <+CookieCutter007> clown shit is the best part
[2:23:30] <%ShinobiPhoenix> it's stupid to compare it to the GB anyway because without being told, you should just assume they updated something anyway and things aren't all going to be one to one. People only know outside information because they look it up
[2:23:31] <%linSP> I like the clown shit too tho
[2:23:31] <%barrakuta371> the Smash remix is a real banger
[2:23:32] <Pookiedaexzile> Clwonshoes shit uptop....and guess what the rest of the track isn't worth it
[2:23:32] <nyacoo> Because you're crazy
[2:23:32] <%RetroCop87> cuz woolie
[2:23:32] <%GeneralSCPatton> Someone please timeout/ban Mangahero18 for the biggest spoilers
[2:23:33] <SuperBloodWolfMoon> It's not clown shit, it's an accordion?
[2:23:34] <Profmcstevie> Honestly Woolie shoulda sent Fear Factory instead LUL
[2:23:35] <%Daniel_Is_I> BECAUSE YOU WERE SAYING THAT FOR EVERYTHING
[2:23:38] <@SSaryn> Because people think you're wrong because they still really like clown shit
[2:23:40] <%SirGO0SE> pretty sure it was HIGH IQ play by Woolie
[2:23:43] <marvel877> Woolie forgets a lot of things but he's adamant to never go back to replaying things that are not fighting games.
[2:23:43] <%Aydarkzero> Kappa
[2:23:45] <Blank9> woolie may as well have said listen to the first 30 seconds of Liberation of Gracemaria for Ace Combat music
[2:23:45] <Pookiedaexzile> The rest of the track is decent
[2:23:47] <%Muffinmastr> woolie doesnt want you disrespecting his clowns
[2:23:48] <%Agami23> half of it sounds like it belongs in a re1 basement
[2:23:49] <%BoxNavy> because you didnt spend 2 minutes on the podcast listening to the whole song :)
[2:23:49] <%RetroCop87> can't you warp?
[2:23:51] <+fatmac1616> Is this one of those channels where everybody roasts the streamer? If so hell yes!!!
[2:23:54] <%Zeikier> the fans of clown shit are the clown makeup meme
[2:23:54] <%goose_attack_almanac> MARINS A GHOST
[2:23:57] <+twohitgood> it's a pirate shanty, not circus music.
[2:23:58] <+MisterAvry> people like you and want you to be less crazy
[2:24:00] <%damienlunas> The clown shit is great, it sounds like all Sea Shanty-esque
[2:24:00] <%StormBuster24> Your crazy about the thing they like, therefore MAD
[2:24:01] <%ggbhtg> @patstaresat it plays on the final boss, where it even rolls fake credits
[2:24:02] <Mangahero18> Spoilers to a 30 year old game??
[2:24:04] <%Monkeyweed21> he expects more out of you than just dismissing something after the first 10 seconds @PatStaresAt
[2:24:04] <Tooniearcade> Silence, Clown ü§°
[2:24:05] <NitronStreams> just looked it up. the beat atarts to drop about 20 seconds into Gangplank galleon
[2:24:08] <majindusto> Starts as Pirate music...AND BECOMES HALLOWED BE THY NAME by IRON MAIDEN
[2:24:09] <%Broand> who's pagliaccin' now?
[2:24:09] <+Pyroclase> because nostalgia probably
[2:24:14] <%Alazull> Oh shit we going big Pat

[2:24:52] <@commanderclaw> Well they're a metal band, so they are
[2:24:53] <%rekinom> You can always hear the fake take in pat's voice
[2:24:53] <%ShinobiPhoenix> if you play the game without guides or knowledge of the original game (or forget about it or assume they changed things), you can figure out the puzzle from in-game clues.
[2:24:53] <@SoFarFetched> Pat I didn't poop myself on stream Kappa

[2:25:22] <%Agami23> hey pat, whats your shirt? is that lavos?
[2:25:26] <%Aydarkzero> it do be a real question though
[2:25:26] <%Monkeyweed21> oh nooooooooooo
[2:25:27] <OldManDeckardCain> pat sure loves telling other people they smell, is he projecting or something Kappa
[2:25:29] <%Piemono> Your asshole takes and your hot takes sound the same though
[2:25:30] <StarkMaximum> @PatStaresAt Yes it's a real question but then people tell you and you just say "that's stupid and you're wrong I continue to be baffled"
[2:25:32] <jacewolf_is_the_best> so when you're doing a seinfeld impression
[2:25:33] <biomegabear> Its lighthearted and fun sounding
[2:25:34] <%yeknomlive> that's fair.
[2:25:34] <%Monkeyweed21> Is this a bit @PatStaresAt ?
[2:25:37] <@commanderclaw> If you phrase it like an asshole, expect people to respond like assholes
[2:25:37] <%Alazull> Sealining?
[2:25:43] <yourliteraldog> Monkeys are fun
[2:25:43] <%BoxNavy> if you hate the backlash try a different form of phrasing i guess
[2:25:43] <Profmcstevie> But the answer is almost always "cos it suits my taste" so why bother
[2:25:45] <%rekinom> @Agami23 It's a bezelgeuse from monster hunter
[2:25:47] <dinnydanny777> But why do you say it like a 90s stand up comedian? NotLikeThis
[2:25:50] <%radda343> Because they're not you
[2:25:51] <%sonofthedeepsouth> REAL? BANJO IS GOOD GAME GOOD
[2:25:56] <%sonofthedeepsouth> PLAY BANJO
[2:25:58] <+VantaXIV> Something something Darth Vader something Melee
[2:26:00] <Manwad> I feel that question has been said by assholes fallaciously enough that people don't register "Why do people like this" as a real question.
[2:26:01] <%BigCoffee> Yeah but since you live in stream mode and on twitter where most people can be screamo, it's hard for someone to tell you the real stuff and proper facts.
[2:26:02] <%Payterodactyl> Pat be like "whats the deal with airline food" and chat be like 'OMFG PAT SHUT UPPPP"
[2:26:03] <%Muffinmastr> what is the deal with woolie and stinky clowns?
[2:26:04] <%Srthunda> so everyone in chat has less patience then league players?
[2:26:04] <%Agami23> ohh. that makes more sense. @rekinom
[2:26:05] <%Aydarkzero> @dinnydanny777 it's his bit LUL
[2:26:06] <%RetroCop87> SEASHELL?
[2:26:08] <%LeiaSkynoober> @majindusto Not even though?? He often goes to Twitter to discuss it more
[2:26:10] <%Daniel_Is_I> People like Banjo because it is a fun and charming 3D platformer that, while inferior to Mario mechanically, is unique and engaging enough to make up for worse controls.
[2:26:12] <%BoxNavy> JESUS GIEF SOUNDS LIKE A MOTORCYCLE
[2:26:14] <Pookiedaexzile> Banjo and Kazooie is "fun" like going to a birthday with hall the decorations but the cake taste like ass and the music sucks
[2:26:15] <+CookieCutter007> What is the deal ?
[2:26:16] <+Dova573> You know its funny that this shit happen with Gankplank galleon because thats one of the tracks that was on my League playlist in highschool
[2:26:18] <%AncelDeLambert> Pat, it's REALLY hard to punch through the crowd to explain something sensibly when you've encited them
[2:26:21] <rasamune> Toot toot
[2:26:26] <+Dova573> That shit got me hype while getting fed
[2:26:27] <%Taisuru> Banjo is a thoroughly excellent 3D platformer with tons of personality
[2:26:28] <%Broand> What game other than banjo is clown music now?
[2:26:28] <Grandma_Amari> Can't wait for Paige to tie you up and force you to play Banjo.
[2:26:33] <%VoidBaronJules> Don't Attribute to Malice, what you can Attribute to idiocy or in this case curiosity
[2:26:33] <Ell1ot> didn't people try to explain animal crossing but you only understood it after you started playing it?
[2:26:35] <%AncelDeLambert> Ahyuck
[2:26:44] <%Dementedpenguin> LUL
[2:26:48] <%ggbhtg> guh huh
[2:26:50] <StarkMaximum> @Ell1ot That is exactly what happened actually
[2:26:57] <nauskills> @PatStaresAt Banjo fans are just a bunch of babies blinded by nostalgia don't worry about it jk
[2:27:02] <Mangahero18> I like Banjo because when you gameover Grunty ends up really fucking hot. It really blunts the impact yaknow.
[2:27:12] <%sonofthedeepsouth> I CAN RATIONALIZE MY HATE
[2:27:13] <+Dova573> Mario 64 is not cartoonish?
[2:27:14] <Mangahero18> Hot Grunty is Best Grunty.
[2:27:15] <%ShinobiPhoenix> @Mangahero18 People openly discuss Star Wars whether you want to know or not. Exactly who is having casual conversations about random puzzles in a game from 1993 that clearly people haven't thought about in years. Also people don't casual discuss puzzle solutions in general.
[2:27:17] <%Muffinmastr> you said banjo had worse movement than mario 64 and i would disagree, except for magic creatures.
[2:27:21] <+twohitgood> banjo is just boring for me.
[2:27:21] <dlocke1991> Watch Pat 100% Banjo Kazooie to better shit on it.
[2:27:23] <s1rcuit> I see too many similarities between it and DK 64
[2:27:27] <Broken_Sonex> Is it true Paige thinks Mario games are overrated? @PatStaresAt
[2:27:30] <biomegabear> @nauskills I played banjo way late but its fun the 2nd game is a bit too big for me
[2:27:30] <%Daniel_Is_I> It doesn't but it doesn't control poorly
[2:27:30] <Explodincatz> both suck
[2:27:30] <+Ilpala> To be fair, Paige is NOT a great example of how that game controls
[2:27:34] <Ookamiden02> agreed
[2:27:34] <pokefan9956> tbh, they both control like ass
[2:27:35] <BlueLunecy> Ain't nothing hits like Mario 64
[2:27:36] <ChungusQuest> trash music = trash game
[2:27:37] <%luftraumm1> its grating
[2:27:38] <Blank9> the sound effects
[2:27:40] <+JustToWatch> But Pat, you are a cartoon
[2:27:41] <%Agami23> pat, if theres one thing i can tell, its that you do research into things you dislike
[2:27:44] <marvel877> There's constructive criticism and then there's talking shit and just hurling insults.
[2:27:45] <Pookiedaexzile> The tone is very "ISNT THIS FUN KIDS"
[2:27:47] <%Broand> tbh I don't like banjo either
[2:27:47] <%DakotaMacDoodle> 2 is better
[2:27:50] <+CookieCutter007> the trap was nice
[2:27:50] <Profmcstevie> I just don't enjoy the tone of Banjo, it does not strike a chord
[2:27:52] <RamenRiderZ> Banjo fans be like kwehkwahkwehkwahkwehkwahkweh
[2:27:53] <StarkMaximum> Yes Pat and every time you say that the only response is "well then Pat hates fun" and that's the only take-away
[2:27:55] <NeroInfinite> That's fair.
[2:27:59] <nauskills> @biomegabear I never tried the 2nd, I should try it
[2:27:59] <%Agami23> soundfont is a big thing
[2:27:59] <%Daniel_Is_I> A Hat in Time doesn't control as well as Mario either but it's still great.
[2:28:00] <majindusto> That's a you problem...Not a Game problem
[2:28:05] <%twistedj3ster> I can see that
[2:28:06] <%walternatorz> italicized sounds
[2:28:08] <%yeknomlive> that's fair. like i cant really stand genesis sound font or w/e
[2:28:09] <%Broand> The soundfont is in comic sans
[2:28:11] <%SirGO0SE> oo thats a good term
[2:28:12] <@commanderclaw> soundfonts are why the clown basement sounds bad
[2:28:12] <%Alazull> Butt fuck indeed
[2:28:13] <marvel877> The Smash Bros versions are not hindered by the N64 soundchip.
[2:28:13] <ChungusQuest> yo those public domain sound effects were very very apparent
[2:28:15] <Pookiedaexzile> No its a game problem
[2:28:16] <%Daniel_Is_I> Here we go.
[2:28:17] <%GeneralSCPatton> @ShinobiPhoenix This isn't about the puzzle. This guy spoiled the whole twist of this game and the ending.
[2:28:17] <heuristicfailure> You're not a fan of the "Teddy Bear Picnic" overworld music?
[2:28:18] <dinnydanny777> Soundfont is a MIDI thing I think
[2:28:20] <Mcmuffin1046> banjo music bad
[2:28:23] <HeroToxiko> Look at it LUL
[2:28:24] <%RetroCop87> SNES and N64 roms have different instruments used for their OST
[2:28:24] <%Muffinmastr> some good songs.. some real bad ones
[2:28:24] <%StrawberryPantsu> It was
[2:28:25] <StarkMaximum> Pat you know adults can be happy right
[2:28:26] <+MisterAvry> what about this tho
[2:28:26] <majindusto> WHIMSY
[2:28:27] <+fatmac1616> Is this a speed run?
[2:28:28] <%DakotaMacDoodle> its still an n64 game but the sequel is an improvment
[2:28:29] <yourliteraldog> So was mario
[2:28:30] <%Dementedpenguin> @StarkMaximum I literally kept seeing that over and over again yesterday. I was like " LUL "
[2:28:30] <%cowardman93> yes pat real instruments do sound better than midi
[2:28:31] <Ragnorok64> as opposed to Mario?
[2:28:31] <KeiPrime> its accessible
[2:28:33] <%Muffinmastr> some song just straight brap
[2:28:33] <+Dova573> just like this game?
[2:28:34] <%Alazull> And that's fine
[2:28:35] <%Monkeyweed21> yea this kids game was made for kids @PatStaresAt
[2:28:36] <+Lord0Mugen> Lord0Mugen subscribed with Prime. 
[2:28:36] <%BoxNavy> no
[2:28:37] <%Daniel_Is_I> Pat, whimsy is not JUST for babies LUL
[2:28:40] <BlueLunecy> Til they let Kazooie say fuck finally
[2:28:40] <$Afterman_> adults are miserable
[2:28:41] <@commanderclaw> Don't you want to Eekum a Bokum
[2:28:41] <%LeiaSkynoober> @StarkMaximum Who even cares tho? He's allowed to dislike things lol
[2:28:41] <%BoxNavy> ban that guy
[2:28:43] <+twohitgood> it absolutely is a baby game. just the babies are grown up and refuse to acknowledge their baby games are baby games.
[2:28:46] <thunka10> CHILDREN ONLY
[2:28:46] <%Agami23> if you have ever wondered why sega genesis songs sound so twangy? thats because of the soundfont
[2:28:47] <@SoFarFetched> no no HELL is for children
[2:28:48] <yourliteraldog> Mario Is for Adults
[2:28:48] <Kghaleon> It was the 90s, it was great for the time. It's better for people with the nostalgia, like a celebration of old Nintendo.
[2:28:49] <%mister___doctor> Banjo Kazooie is for Goofy Goobers
[2:28:50] <%BinaryFireball> is spyro made for babies or is it made for stoners?
[2:28:50] <Profmcstevie> Joy is ages 3 and under
[2:28:51] <%MechArch> too real
[2:28:51] <majindusto> PAT SAYS BOO WHIMSY
[2:28:52] <filialpails> is super mario 64 a mature game for big geniuses?
[2:28:54] <%walternatorz> wait.. how'd marin..
[2:28:54] <%sonofthedeepsouth> PAT WANTS THAT CONKER EDGE
[2:28:54] <%Jekado> even i feel like children shouldn't be allowed to be happy
[2:28:55] <%twistedj3ster> is that why you still act like a child? /s
[2:28:59] <ape_hawk> happiness is for children and republicans
[2:29:00] <%sonofthedeepsouth> MARIO IS SO ADULT
[2:29:01] <yourliteraldog> Mature Mario Games
[2:29:01] <thunka10> Happiness is the bastion of youth
[2:29:01] <%Alazull> It's fine if Pat does not like the thing you like, because lord knows we don't like things he likes
[2:29:02] <%Jekado> Hell... HELL IS FOR CHILDREN
[2:29:02] <biomegabear> @nauskills Ok if someone is nostalgic for tooie then they explored the levels hubs forever and remembered what did what where. Sometimes is N64 crypic
[2:29:03] <%Daniel_Is_I> SPYRO IS GREAT
[2:29:03] <%shurtal> Banjo Kazooie is Saturday Morning Cartoon The Game
[2:29:03] <KonekoSilvertail> yes
[2:29:05] <%BinaryFireball> oh man
[2:29:05] <%BoxNavy> its a collecty game
[2:29:06] <%yeknomlive> stoners def
[2:29:06] <+krawtch> my problem with BK is it plays worse than Mario 64
[2:29:07] <%rumtumtugnutz> You know that you can still like things if the internet man doesn't, right?
[2:29:08] <+Gigagoat> he's a dragon
[2:29:08] <%AncelDeLambert> I tried Spyro and immediately fell off
[2:29:08] <Blank9> spyro is a game made
[2:29:09] <Onatamana> When I was a kid, I genuinely thought adults were not allowed to have fun.
[2:29:10] <Mangahero18> False. The min you turn 18 the Happiness just DRAINS out of you. It goes down the toliet as piss.
[2:29:11] <+RaziWraith> why not both? :)
[2:29:11] <Blank9> that's all
[2:29:11] <Saltmeisterr> BRAAAAPPP
[2:29:11] <%BoxNavy> YEAH TOLD YA
[2:29:12] <+MisterAvry> spyro is made for 12 year olds
[2:29:12] <+twohitgood> spyro was made for money
[2:29:13] <StarkMaximum> "I know nothing about Spyro" So you hate it is what you're saying it
[2:29:13] <%Aydarkzero> Spyro is just a fun game
[2:29:15] <%Monkeyweed21> its a furry thing
[2:29:16] <ape_hawk> did he do a stinky?
[2:29:16] <%BinaryFireball> hahaha
[2:29:17] <%SomeSageAdvice> big loud snore?
[2:29:17] <%Broand> that snoring is shaking my room
[2:29:17] <%BinaryFireball> is that
[2:29:18] <%Srthunda> spyro was great until it wasnt
[2:29:18] <Kghaleon> Spyro has hot furrys
[2:29:18] <Onatamana> Turns out my parents were unhappy
[2:29:18] <%king_wragles> Zangeif is shitting his ass
[2:29:18] <%walternatorz> VESUVIUS IS RUMBLING
[2:29:18] <%rekinom> All I know about Spyro is that he makes a great subway sandwich
[2:29:18] <yourliteraldog> Baby Stoners
[2:29:18] <biomegabear> Spyro had the sonic problem 3 good games and then WEIRD ASS SHIT
[2:29:19] <Profmcstevie> That dog sounds like a pneumatic drill
[2:29:20] <HeroToxiko> i can understand having an initial reaction of "thats baby shit" but tbh we're adults and it doesn't matter what we like, within reason
[2:29:21] <%StrawberryPantsu> Spyro is actually good
[2:29:22] <%damienlunas> BLURGH
[2:29:22] <HeroToxiko> AWWWWWWWWWWWWWWW
[2:29:22] <StarkMaximum> OH HE IS OUT

[2:29:46] <KosOrSomeSayKosm_> it's a dog shaped blob
[2:29:47] <%BoxNavy> D:
[2:29:47] <%sonofthedeepsouth> sleep
[2:29:47] <Kghaleon> Paige turned into a doggo
[2:29:47] <%Lord0Mugen> @PatStaresAt Even though your hatred for RARE is made of insanity. I still subbed anyway. Happy 2021 You crazy short ginger man.
[2:29:50] <HeroToxiko> he even got de baby tongu
[2:29:51] <ExpressNode> Oh he's snoring. I thought a controller was vibrating
[2:29:51] <%ssjklyco> I thought that was my Demon's souls audio
[2:29:52] <+MisterAvry> his tongue is still out from like an hour ago
[2:29:53] <%DakotaMacDoodle> what the hell geif sounds like a marble dropping on the floor
[2:29:54] <%Xevtes> hahaha
[2:29:59] <%BoxNavy> do not laugh ah him.... :(
[2:30:01] <%Daniel_Is_I> @PatStaresAt If you like Ratchet and Clank's humor you'll like Spyro's. Similar tone.
[2:30:04] <%Muffinmastr> loud judgment of geif
[2:30:06] <Mrpresidentofsony_> Snoresaurus
[2:30:07] <%Calliphor> What a sweet spoiled potato
[2:30:08] <%ElkRiverDog> Holy crap I thought that was a sound effect in the game
[2:30:09] <%damienlunas> Pat, Zangief looks very warm. Can you confirm if he is very warm.
[2:30:13] <segychan> peenus
[2:30:21] <%damienlunas> thank you
[2:30:22] <%BinaryFireball> you should try the spyros sometime you might like
[2:30:22] <%Aydarkzero> can't wait for the ps5 game
[2:30:23] <%Agami23> spyro might be right up your alley then. crash might kill you though
[2:30:23] <yourliteraldog> Conker was made for stoners
[2:30:24] <%ShinobiPhoenix> and the Death Star blowing up is most certainly not a "twist" of the movie
[2:30:27] <nauskills> @PatStaresAt Is zangief aware that he's more popular than you?
[2:30:28] <biomegabear> No game after the first 3 spyro games are good
[2:30:31] <Zebens> Pat, you should have 2 cameras. One at you and the other at your dog
[2:30:32] <dinnydanny777> The spyro gamecube game was so bad
[2:30:32] <%ggbhtg> Kazooie is constantly snarky tho, and there's an undertone of jerk-itude throughout the game like Adventure Time.
[2:30:35] <%AzureGale> Pat Stares At Ratchet & Clank when
[2:30:37] <Saltmeisterr> BOMB ARROWS
[2:30:37] <%rumtumtugnutz> Banjo is a game I never cared for, but it was because I mostly played JRPGs by that point
[2:30:38] <%yeknomlive> just curious but how many of those 3d platformers do you like? i kind of grew out of them personally
[2:30:40] <s1rcuit> I loved Ratchet and Clank until they remade the first one
[2:30:41] <+nottheminimum> nice
[2:30:43] <Broken_Sonex> Is it true Paige thinks Mario games are overrated?
[2:30:44] <%Axellogic> Would Pat have ANY interest in playing the Spyro remake anymore?
[2:30:55] <StarkMaximum> WELL FUCK HER TOO
[2:30:58] <JobbedBone> banjo is the final fantasy tactics of platformers
[2:30:59] <@SoFarFetched> didnt she play mario kart?
[2:30:59] <majindusto> In the case of Donkey Kong Country...Sea Shanty music Isn't Clown Music
[2:31:03] <@commanderclaw> That take is worse than most of Pat's
[2:31:04] <@SoFarFetched> geefThink
[2:31:05] <marvel877> 2
[2:31:05] <+Novembermagnus> The Spyro reboot trilogy is fun in it's owbn way.
[2:31:06] <%Alazull> That's super fucking coconuts
[2:31:06] <%BoxNavy> D:
[2:31:09] <%Lord0Mugen> Banjo Kazooie just has the perfect level design of all 3D platformers.
[2:31:09] <biomegabear> @StarkMaximum he does
[2:31:10] <%ggbhtg> spyro is a trilogy, then the OG developers moved on
[2:31:10] <%astuteabberation> Spyro has some NICE ASS controls, i'd really recommend giving it a shot
[2:31:12] <Broken_Sonex> Wow. Fuck her then
[2:31:12] <pokefan9956> okay, I like both banjo and mario. not liking mario is waaaaaaaaay worse
[2:31:16] <+MisterAvry> hooker
[2:31:16] <ExpressNode> That's actually astonishing.
[2:31:17] <Profmcstevie> Has she ever....played them?
[2:31:18] <NitronStreams> I cant play any Mario game made before Mario Galaxy
[2:31:21] <vonmaultke> Because SHES RIGHT
[2:31:21] <%StormBuster24> I mean same, but I would at least try them co-op
[2:31:22] <+TheNewZealandStory> all 2d mario games are bad and half the 3d ones are too
[2:31:24] <+MisterAvry> er, hookshot that
[2:31:27] <@SoFarFetched> Paige played Mario Kart 8 on her channel years ago
[2:31:30] <%ggbhtg> Kazooie is constantly snarky tho, and there's an undertone of jerk-itude throughout the game like Adventure Time. @patstaresat
[2:31:32] <Pookiedaexzile> Real hot takes: Blinx the Cat is a better character design than Banjo and Kazooie
[2:31:35] <@Mechz71> Which Zelda do you like more? Green or blue Zelda?
[2:31:38] <%wibbwobbler> that's pretty metal
[2:31:38] <%RetroCop87> mARIO 3 IS TECHNICALLY A MASTERPIECE, BUT IT'S A 7/10 GAME
[2:31:39] <%Alazull> "Would"
[2:31:41] <%Aydarkzero> oddly enough i only ever really like to play the handheld mario games
[2:31:41] <%Lord0Mugen> Its small enough you can get to places but larger enough that you can put shit in.
[2:31:44] <ExpressNode> Mario saved the game industry
[2:31:45] <%ClericOfSparda> The heart piece!!!
[2:31:45] <%RetroCop87> Jesus, this capc lock
[2:31:47] <+Chester_goes_Berserk> I get if the aesthetic doesn't do anything for her
[2:31:48] <%rumtumtugnutz> Mario Kart isn't a Mario game
[2:31:49] <%MechArch> kill it
[2:31:50] <%Mendin> Zangief the Walrus
[2:31:52] <ChungusQuest> oh god is that walrus hairless?
[2:31:54] <%ClericOfSparda> the one outside!
[2:31:55] <%BoxNavy> SourPls
[2:31:57] <%ShinobiPhoenix> I mean to be fair, I have over the years lost interest in playing 2D Mario games, they aren't bad, but they aren't for me anymore, where as 3D Marios are alwaays for me
[2:31:57] <%damienlunas> Guys, every time Pat says "I don't like this, it's for babies" all you need to say is "Okay, Boomer" and move on
[2:32:05] <%BoxNavy> he died
[2:32:06] <%rekinom> This is giving me some "baby game for babies" vibes right now
[2:32:08] <+krawtch> he killed himself
[2:32:08] <rasamune> Rip in pieces you fat fuck
[2:32:08] <Mangahero18> DANCE WALRUS.
[2:32:11] <%Zeikier> what horrible sounds coming from that poor creature
[2:32:12] <KruelDestiny> It died FeelsBadMan
[2:32:13] <%za7az> DEAD
[2:32:14] <%LeiaSkynoober> Marin loves crimes
[2:32:14] <+StromkoPenguin> Oh I'm sorry he'd rather throw himself into the ocean than listen to your song anymore.
[2:32:15] <%Muffinmastr> Pat, did you know the put female link, linkle into the 1st hyrule warriors?
[2:32:15] <%Broand> that walrus is fuckin' dead
[2:32:16] <%Emperor_Machinus> it Yeeted himself
[2:32:18] <%MechArch> rip
[2:32:18] <KosOrSomeSayKosm_> she sang so good it killed itself
[2:32:19] <Zebens> sing to him again
[2:32:24] <%ShinobiPhoenix> I mean I can always play Yoshi's Island or SMB2-USA
[2:32:26] <ape_hawk> does marin have brain damage?
[2:32:26] <%RetroCop87> time for the animal village orgy
[2:32:37] <Torgue_1> Cause you r babby
[2:32:39] <Zebens> What about Minecraft?
[2:32:40] <Is_Nation> Pat what's your take on Digimon games? You and Woolie mentioned how Pokemon games are kinda sucky and most of the problems you both had are directly addressed in *some* of those games
[2:32:40] <Mangahero18> Pokemon is a baby game for babies.
[2:32:42] <%Lord0Mugen> @PatStaresAt Pat you yourself ARE a baby
[2:32:44] <%BoxNavy> mario is babies but those games are good
[2:32:47] <%walternatorz> winnie the pooh home run derby

[2:32:54] <%RetroCop87> just wait for the Mario boss
[2:32:55] <+twohitgood> mario RPG is a baby game for babies but i love it.
[2:32:55] <Pookiedaexzile> You're saying Ok Boomer, but Banjo and Kazooie is for 26 to 40 year old millenials
[2:32:56] <%BoxNavy> its cool though
[2:32:58] <+krawtch> fight bowser

[2:33:15] <olaksi> wait, what is the criteria for baby game again
[2:33:15] <majindusto> Yes...Only "Mario" enemies
[2:33:15] <nauskills> Babies with a culture for thighs
[2:33:16] <%rekinom> I refuse to believe 2B's dump truck ass was rendered for babies
[2:33:17] <RamenRiderZ> Dismissing games as baby games? What, rushing to the grave grandpa? Kappa
[2:33:18] <%ShinobiPhoenix> I am not into Digimon Story Cyber Sleuth like people swear by. THey just like that it plays like Persona
[2:33:18] <%yeknomlive> those babies are in for a rough ride
[2:33:20] <+Novembermagnus> That ass is rated E for everyone.
[2:33:20] <bobkirchsteiger> banjo and kazooie is the bear and bird game right?
[2:33:22] <NeroInfinite> I'd liek to see a baby play Neir Automata. LUL
[2:33:23] <%thebeargoesHONK> home run derby is no baby game. they wouldn't have Satan in it otherwise
[2:33:24] <%AncelDeLambert> oh ffs
[2:33:25] <dinnydanny777> That game would be traumatizing for a child LUL
[2:33:25] <%astuteabberation> any game pat likes is for babies bc he is a baby man
[2:33:25] <%walternatorz> ...
[2:33:25] <%Mendin> Nier Automata is for dead babies mor elike it
[2:33:26] <heuristicfailure> Real adults only play mature games like Kirby.

[2:33:35] <nauskills> Android don't produce milk
[2:33:36] <NitronStreams> NO
[2:33:36] <Mangahero18> Digimon Cybersleuth is legimately a better game than ANY of the last few generations of Pokemon.
[2:33:36] <Profmcstevie> DMC is a series for babies, haha your games are about family
[2:33:37] <+CookieCutter007> LUL

[2:33:52] <yourliteraldog> Boy Milk
[2:33:52] <%rumtumtugnutz> If I say 'I don't like Mario games but I like mario Kart, that just means I like a cart-racing game that happens to have Mario characters in it, there is no gameplay similarities between Mario Kart and Super mario Bros.
[2:33:54] <%SirGO0SE> +2 @BoxNavy

[2:34:06] <+Novembermagnus> ...There are several possible definitions for "ass milk"
[2:34:09] <Kghaleon> If you know the deal with the island, then the weird shit makes sense.
[2:34:12] <%ShinobiPhoenix> I found Cyber Sleuth very boring and took WAY too long to even start, let alone anything interesting to happen, didn't even buy it on sale
[2:34:12] <%astuteabberation> nier automata doesn't have milk it's got cake
[2:34:13] <%RoggleJr> The booty milk quenches the thirst.
[2:34:14] <%Aydarkzero> monkaS
[2:34:15] <NeroInfinite> I refuse to google ass milk
[2:34:16] <%Crasgnab> YA HA HA

[2:34:41] <+DJAllblue> nier automata gives you the drive to make babies LUL
[2:34:44] <%ShinobiPhoenix> I have more fun with Monster Sanctuary or TemTem than Cyber Sleuth

[2:35:10] <Saltmeisterr> from alttp
[2:35:11] <%BoxNavy> oh...
[2:35:11] <%ggbhtg> @patstaresat Pat, why is "The Lock" best episode of Jojo, or has that old opinion changed?
[2:35:18] <Is_Nation> @ShinobiPhoenix bruh
[2:35:20] <uglybug71> donkey milk
[2:35:23] <%BoxNavy> that was hard to solve
[2:35:25] <+Novembermagnus> @ShinobiPhoenix try the digimon world game, the most recent one. its pretty great.
[2:35:26] <%rumtumtugnutz> I hate how there is always someone who thinks any game you can possibly mention is a masterpiece.
[2:35:28] <dinnydanny777> Oh god those eyes NotLikeThis
[2:35:34] <%sonofthedeepsouth> YEAH
[2:35:39] <+MisterAvry> you did the good job
[2:35:43] <yourliteraldog> Peekaboo
[2:35:54] <%ShinobiPhoenix> TemTem is giving Pokemon but smoother, Cyber Sleutuh is just pretend Persona
[2:36:03] <TallGuyWithAHoodie> @shinobiphoenix I'm sorry to hear that abot Cyber Sleuth. Its gameplay mechanics are admittedly pretty simple. Story goes fucking places though.
[2:36:03] <nauskills> Looks fun
[2:36:06] <Is_Nation> Don't play Digimon World 1 without an excel spreadsheet printout
[2:36:07] <s1rcuit> I don't like the texture of it's segments
[2:36:18] <%Muffinmastr> hey 9S, 2B didnt have enough tit milk so we need some of your milk.
[2:36:18] <%ShinobiPhoenix> and Monster Sanctuary is doing Pokemon Metroid
[2:36:20] <Broken_Sonex> ....I still can't get over Paige not liking Mario. That's worse than hating Banjo.
[2:36:27] <$Afterman_> dont fall into the sand butthole
[2:36:27] <%BoxNavy> hate looking at this thing
[2:36:29] <NitronStreams> Why does it have a propeller but?
[2:36:32] <NitronStreams> butt?
[2:36:33] <%Taisuru> @Is_Nation Yeah pretty much, love that game but FUCK man
[2:36:35] <ape_hawk> is this NTR?
[2:36:43] <+walternatorz> for butt milk
[2:36:44] <Saltmeisterr> imagine liking the games i don't like
[2:36:46] <%rumtumtugnutz> @NitronStreams So it can fly
[2:36:46] <%ggbhtg> @patstaresat Pat, why did you consider "The Lock" to be the best episode of Jojo? Has that old opinion changed?
[2:36:46] <rookeealding> bomb?
[2:36:47] <+krawtch> the propeller butt helps it get into your canned goods
[2:36:48] <blackbookalpha> fan the farts ez
[2:36:48] <Pookiedaexzile> Yes, Mario is universial, everyone must love everything
[2:36:49] <meromaromiro> How would it fly without the propeller butt?
[2:36:50] <%ShinobiPhoenix> I watched someone play Cyber Sleuth from the beginning and like 45 minutes later NOTHING happened
[2:36:50] <%ClericOfSparda> Sand B u t t h o l e
[2:36:51] <Kghaleon> Paige isn't wrong, lot of Mario games are practically the same
[2:36:58] <%Muffinmastr> the sand looks niiiice
[2:37:00] <yourliteraldog> aim for the butt its the weak point
[2:37:03] <s1rcuit> @PatStaresAt what are your thoughts on the first two Paper Mario games?
[2:37:03] <%AzureGale> It's the same flying principle Tails uses
[2:37:06] <%BoxNavy> its a good power
[2:37:07] <dd44dostivei> is this shadow of the colossus?
[2:37:08] <+ScrapSentinel> ScrapSentinel subscribed with Prime. They've subscribed for 6 months! 
[2:37:11] <%BoxNavy> OOOOWAH!
[2:37:16] <ChungusQuest> the sand effect with the footsteps in particular is very pretty
[2:37:17] <Mangahero18> The one from Mini Shakedown dude?
[2:37:17] <%ShinobiPhoenix> and that immediately killed any desire to even buy Cyber Sleuth on sale for $25 bucks
[2:37:17] <AndRooTang> Thanks for the 2020Victory @scrapsentinel
[2:37:17] <%Aydarkzero> the one about guilt?
[2:37:21] <Is_Nation> @ShinobiPhoenix that's like 90% of RPGs mate lol
[2:37:24] <+twohitgood> pat *really* hates liars.
[2:37:26] <nauskills> You did it, you killed an innocent creature in its nest
[2:37:29] <ape_hawk> the key came from the butt
[2:37:30] <tragicjohnson84> Its a creative idea for a power
[2:37:35] <%ShinobiPhoenix> @Is_Nation the HELL is it
[2:37:40] <s1rcuit> Narcists are immune to the lock
[2:37:46] <%ShinobiPhoenix> Breath of Fire II isn't that slow
[2:37:47] <ShichiNoBushi> "I have no sense of guilt."
[2:37:47] <%AncelDeLambert> so it's a nerfed build?
[2:37:55] <pokefan9956> gahhh. I completely forgot about that stand
[2:37:56] <Profmcstevie> The most jojo stand there could be, weak and situational
[2:37:56] <%mister___doctor> It wouldnt work against ANYONE then
[2:37:59] <@commanderclaw> So it wouldn't work on my Brother in Law then
[2:37:59] <NitronStreams> thats is interesting
[2:38:01] <Zebens> sing to Walrus again
[2:38:03] <TallGuyWithAHoodie> Cyber Sleuth's story is a slow-ass burn but man it goes amazing places.
[2:38:07] <Is_Nation> A majority of JRPGs have a slow start. Where have you been? lol
[2:38:07] <%ShinobiPhoenix> Dragon Quest 1 isn't that slow
[2:38:08] <%Bane_Kaikyo> I don't even remember the lock
[2:38:10] <%AncelDeLambert> what good is a power that doesn't work against sociopaths?
[2:38:11] <Blank9> bof1 and 2 are incredibly rough compared to 3 and 4
[2:38:16] <%Sol_Install> I'm good
[2:38:17] <Blank9> 3 and 4 are incredible though
[2:38:18] <%rumtumtugnutz> Paper Mario games aren't real Mario games. Neither are the Mario and Luigi games.
[2:38:21] <%ggbhtg> so it exemplifies the nature of Stands to you? @patstaresat
[2:38:22] <+CookieCutter007> drugs kicking in
[2:38:22] <ManfredA> @PatStaresAt if Young Joseph fought The Lock that chapter would be one panel long
[2:38:22] <%Zundelle> I enjoy
[2:38:22] <%GeneralSCPatton> The rage has subsided, mostly
[2:38:24] <%AzureGale> This is p good overall
[2:38:24] <@commanderclaw> Nah, that was a value add
[2:38:25] <tragicjohnson84> What was wrong?
[2:38:28] <%ShinobiPhoenix> Dragon Quest 11 or Dragon Quest Builders
[2:38:30] <%BoxNavy> its a good stream we are having
[2:38:33] <+HiroTSK5> I think this is the longest stretch between dungeons in this game
[2:38:34] <Kghaleon> :(
[2:38:35] <ape_hawk> hear that, chat!? 30 more minutes left in the stream!!
[2:38:35] <%za7az> I'm having fun
[2:38:37] <s1rcuit> @PatStaresAt it's not about progress, it's about entertainment
[2:38:39] <%Aydarkzero> give her some water
[2:38:41] <Zayasu> eu chat is better :)
[2:38:41] <Is_Nation> 2 games lol
[2:38:42] <%ShinobiPhoenix> it's about the story AND getting to do things whether the story is going or not

[2:38:46] <%Zundelle> Dragon Quest Builders is sick

[2:38:48] <%GalacticaPhanto> @blank9 I would say the GBA versions of BoF are better than the SNES
[2:38:48] <%FuzzTime> :)
[2:38:50] <%shruke> The lock would be a great stand for like, politics
[2:38:50] <Profmcstevie> Wind Fish got weird dreams

[2:38:53] <olaksi> I didn't know FFX ripped off zelda
[2:38:54] <%Aydarkzero> but that's just a theory Kappa
[2:38:57] <Saltmeisterr> no :)
[2:38:58] <%GeneralSCPatton> WHAT? NO! DEFINITELY NOT! WHO TOLD HIM!?
[2:38:58] <+sixcubit> weird guess
[2:38:59] <%mister___doctor> nooooooo
[2:39:00] <+twohitgood> how can you kill something that was never alive?
[2:39:00] <%goose_attack_almanac> Dragon Quest Builders is sick

[2:39:04] <%AncelDeLambert> psaSmug
[2:39:05] <Is_Nation> Cyber Sleuth takes a hot minute to gear up but when it goes it fucking goes
[2:39:06] <Kemmybelle> why would you say that?
[2:39:07] <%Pappajimbo> what you taking about wllis
[2:39:08] <%ShinobiPhoenix> 45-a hour, Cyber Sleuth was cutscenes and tutorials
[2:39:08] <ape_hawk> pat... we're all in a dream...

[2:39:09] <DartAran> Are you ready to get existential!
[2:39:12] <%linSP> How is anything real if our eyes aren‚Äôt real
[2:39:13] <%Rain_Mage> A Game Theory
[2:39:13] <ape_hawk> snake eater!!
[2:39:13] <Zebens> a Game Theory
[2:39:17] <%hrbeck_> Oh. Good hunter....
[2:39:20] <ShichiNoBushi> A... game theory?
[2:39:21] <+sixcubit> actually pretty curious why he guessed that
[2:39:22] <%rekinom> I can't believe the wind fish is jecht
[2:39:23] <%BoxNavy> the owl basically tells you youre in a dream the first time you see him
[2:39:26] <%mister___doctor> I used to read word up magazine
[2:39:29] <%goose_attack_almanac> I watched a Cat Girl cry to this
[2:39:36] <+Novembermagnus> Remember when Game Theory was interesting?
[2:39:40] <pokefan9956> different character
[2:39:42] <%Maids4lyfe> she didn't
[2:39:42] <+Falkdaddu> That's Malon
[2:39:42] <BlueLunecy> That's Malon
[2:39:43] <%BoxNavy> thats malon not marin
[2:39:43] <%Agami23> yeah it was
[2:39:44] <Kghaleon> That ain't Marina
[2:39:44] <%SomeSageAdvice> that's Malon, not Marin
[2:39:44] <%ClericOfSparda> YES
[2:39:44] <%Taisuru> Same
[2:39:44] <Blank9> that's malon
[2:39:44] <BlueLunecy> And maybe
[2:39:45] <$Afterman_> dream version based off real version
[2:39:45] <%BoxNavy> :)
[2:39:46] <Broken_Sonex> Yes
[2:39:46] <majindusto> She Didn't
[2:39:47] <%SGrim> yes
[2:39:47] <alex_xander_b> she didn't
[2:39:47] <ShichiNoBushi> Malin ‚â† Malon
[2:39:48] <%Zeikier> cuz they're spelled differently and also yes
[2:39:48] <ape_hawk> shes a freddy kruger
[2:39:48] <%za7az> Yes
[2:39:48] <%Muffinmastr> do you want to knoow?
[2:39:48] <Zebens> yes
[2:39:49] <Palmtuna> Stop projecting, Pat
[2:39:49] <%Maids4lyfe> Marin and Malon are not the fucking same
[2:39:49] <%Dakuu75> that's called "magic" but, yes.
[2:39:49] <ChungusQuest> that's a strong power
[2:39:49] <%mr_whet_faartz> might be that
[2:39:49] <%Deft_Thought> "Link"
[2:39:49] <Explodincatz> yes
[2:39:50] <%ggbhtg> this a different gurl
[2:39:50] <%weissguard> Different Character
[2:39:51] <filialpails> marin =/= malon
[2:39:52] <@commanderclaw> The power of "The Red Thirst" is strong
[2:39:52] <%goose_attack_almanac> Twilight Princess Link got it from his dad
[2:39:52] <%Alazull> Honry power
[2:39:53] <%FuzzTime> Because canon doesn't exist in LoZ lmao
[2:39:53] <heuristicfailure> that was Malon
[2:39:55] <KeiPrime> thats malin not marin
[2:39:55] <meromaromiro> Reincarnation
[2:39:55] <%cvp5127> yes tho
[2:39:56] <JobbedBone> I have that power too
[2:39:56] <Supabait> the power of shitty continuity
[2:39:56] <%mister___doctor> Yes
[2:39:57] <%Rain_Mage> How did Marin show up in Hyrule Warriors
[2:39:59] <%SirGO0SE> LUL
[2:39:59] <+twohitgood> malon like lon lon farm
[2:39:59] <%Aydarkzero> i'd do it for a redhead
[2:40:00] <marvel877> That's Malon and that's a design reuse
[2:40:01] <%tigerfang86> they're NOT THE SAME PAT
[2:40:01] <%ClericOfSparda> Link loves redheads
[2:40:03] <majindusto> Malon Isn't Marin
[2:40:04] <%rekinom> If wanting to bust in redheads enough makes one materialize I'd have mine by now
[2:40:04] <Profmcstevie> Change a letter and it's a new girl, definitely not cheating :)
[2:40:05] <heuristicfailure> different redhead
[2:40:05] <Blank9> there's many redheads to bust in
[2:40:06] <%sonofthedeepsouth> YES
[2:40:07] <s1rcuit> @Novembermagnus did you see the vid he did on rupees?
[2:40:08] <%FuzzTime> "Do I look like your girlfriend?"
[2:40:09] <yourliteraldog> TRIPPLE TIME LINE
[2:40:11] <%Agami23> i mean, lets be real
[2:40:12] <%Aydarkzero> sure chat Kappa
[2:40:12] <pokefan9956> this takes place waaaaay after ocarina
[2:40:13] <%RetroCop87> WARP
[2:40:14] <%BoxNavy> theyre the same to pat
[2:40:16] <%goose_attack_almanac> Zelda
[2:40:16] <%SomeSageAdvice> Marin more than likely was based on Link's memory of Malon though
[2:40:16] <%Agami23> cremia all the way
[2:40:18] <Kemmybelle> her name is Malon in OoT
[2:40:19] <%Srthunda> even if characters look the same, they are not the same and never will be
[2:40:21] <jellssssss20> No Pat, that‚Äôs where YOUR stand came from
[2:40:22] <TallGuyWithAHoodie> Cyber Sleuth has *the strongest* take on a Pokemon Hall of Fame.
[2:40:23] <%wibbwobbler> idk that's kinda cliche
[2:40:24] <%hrbeck_> Link‚Äôs got hos with different names
[2:40:27] <%rumtumtugnutz> Link doesn't know what sex is
[2:40:28] <+Ilpala> You didn't on graveyard puzzle, why start believing us now
[2:40:30] <alex_xander_b> just like how romani and malon are different
[2:40:30] <%za7az> Chat is ALL liars
[2:40:31] <%Aydarkzero> the gods did it i don't know
[2:40:31] <%ClericOfSparda> Let's be real, we all want to bust inside of a redhead
[2:40:31] <TallGuyWithAHoodie> Twice!
[2:40:32] <%Dakuu75> Pat doesn't believe the chat? (He's learning.)
[2:40:32] <majindusto> Marin is in Hyrule Warriors tho
[2:40:32] <+HiroTSK5> Marin is really fun to play as in Hyrule Warriors
[2:40:33] <heuristicfailure> Marin has a red flower in her hair. Totally different character
[2:40:43] <%ggbhtg> The IMPORTANT thing is, Redheads ARE top tiers
[2:40:44] <%Gogogolem> @PatStaresAt dont' you dream about people you know?
[2:40:45] <%AncelDeLambert> a Zelda timeline is a trap, don't fall for it
[2:40:45] <JobbedBone> pat have you seen the sphinx cat bingus
[2:40:46] <$Jaxnos> nah, Pat's right. Malon is just Marin with bad kerning.
[2:40:48] <Kemmybelle> Guess you gotta stream more Zelda and find out.
[2:40:51] <%Taisuru> Do color dungeon
[2:40:52] <Broken_Sonex> To be fair, they're basically the same character
[2:40:52] <ape_hawk> why is link killing cops?
[2:40:53] <%weissguard> You can check the number of seashells you have on your Items screen.
[2:40:53] <%BoxNavy> you did it
[2:40:54] <NitronStreams> yay.
[2:40:56] <%Agami23> but they work on a dairy farm so you know eventually they will have some real mommy milkers
[2:40:57] <%Muffinmastr> you will see what happens to marin at the end of the gamee
[2:40:58] <s1rcuit> @ClericOfSparda *attractive redheads
[2:40:59] <%N0bdyNoOne> BY THE POWER OF BUSTING IN RED HEADS, WE UNLOCKED THE NEXT SEASHELL LEVEL
[2:41:02] <%Aydarkzero> tier 2 goop reward PogChamp
[2:41:09] <dinnydanny777> Link canonically has sex
[2:41:09] <+Novembermagnus> @s1rcuit idk, man. I havnt watched any of his stuff in, like, 5 years.
[2:41:11] <%Dakuu75> A TWO-PRONG PINK DILDO
[2:41:13] <majindusto> Malon also looks NOTHING like Marin
[2:41:17] <%ScrapSentinel> Thank you pat, your streams are helping take my mind off the awful pain caused by COVID-19. Wear your masks kids, this infection SUCKS.
[2:41:24] <%ShinobiPhoenix> I am LITERALLY in the middle of catalogging my games and I am WELL over 900 games, I am not spending money and time on a game that is wasting mine like that when I have others I can play, It's cool that others will enjoy Cyber Sleuth like my friend, but I lost abilty to justify buying it even on sale after watching someone play
[2:41:26] <%BoxNavy> WutFace
[2:41:27] <%king_wragles> Ya, they may as well just give you the rest of the shells at that point.
[2:41:28] <JobbedBone> big mommy milkie gf PogChamp
[2:41:34] <%Monkeyweed21> did you turn it off?
[2:41:35] <Kghaleon> I don't think I ever did my 3 heart run of this game.
[2:41:41] <ShichiNoBushi> I like when one of the rewards for collecting things is a detector for the collectables.
[2:41:41] <$Afterman_> yeah lick covid butthole
[2:41:42] <$Afterman_> i mean what
[2:41:43] <%ShinobiPhoenix> sometimes, Let's Play DO prevent a sale
[2:41:45] <s1rcuit> @Novembermagnus the rupees one was I think 2-3 years ago
[2:41:49] <ManfredA> I had Covid 3 weeks ago

[2:42:23] <+Ilpala> you gon buy that heart piece?
[2:42:25] <Zebens> waiitng Rupees NotLikeThis
[2:42:30] <%ggbhtg> So The Lock is your fav because it exemplifies the appeal of Stands to you? Would you show that ep to sell someone new to Jojo? @patstaresat
[2:42:31] <Kghaleon> @ManfredA My friend invited me out for steak last month and he tested positive for covid a few days later. FFff
[2:42:33] <Seancicle> pre-crisis
[2:42:39] <%Aydarkzero> if Pat stole he'd be called thief for the rest of the game monkaS
[2:42:45] <ChungusQuest> @Axellogic my sympathies, that's totally fucked
[2:42:47] <TallGuyWithAHoodie> My favorite Stand is Harvest.
[2:42:54] <Is_Nation> @ShinobiPhoenix Hey man you like what you like, lord knows adding JRPGs to a long backlog aint gonna help. I'm just saying if a slow burn aint for you then most JRPGs are gonna have the same issue
[2:43:05] <JobbedBone> what use is a stand that can't punch?
[2:43:08] <+Joe2187> is that a fucking rock

[2:46:45] <%damienlunas> Power Nut Kreygasm
[2:46:46] <%FuzzTime> Kappa
[2:46:46] <%StrawberryPantsu> POWER NUT
[2:46:47] <%RetroCop87> Does Vergil get power nuts?
[2:46:48] <ShichiNoBushi> Heheh... "Power nut".
[2:46:48] <@SoFarFetched> geefStahp don't nut in chat,Pat
[2:46:49] <KeiPrime> thepizza power and the guardian nut
[2:46:52] <DraxTD> pat lacks joy
[2:46:53] <%BoxNavy> jermaPluto youre old now
[2:46:54] <%rekinom> The zelda games don't make pat hit his power nut
[2:46:54] <+Milpool> I can only usually manage one power nut a day
[2:46:54] <+sixcubit> understandable
[2:46:54] <Grandma_Amari> Kreygasm
[2:46:56] <Kghaleon> This game basically led to Link to the past existing.
[2:46:57] <RetributionP> power nut
[2:46:57] <%ClericOfSparda> "Power Nut" is a helluva phrase
[2:46:59] <%Agami23> i wonder if link to the past would
[2:47:01] <dots4eyes> Metroid when
[2:47:02] <Profmcstevie> They hover at a constant "oh that's kiiiinda nice" for me
[2:47:02] <+cgreene64> I've never really liked Zelda games tbh
[2:47:05] <%Emperor_Machinus> it is no Hollow Knight
[2:47:05] <%Sol_Install> yea no
[2:47:07] <%AlteisenReiseZ> Nah, I get it
[2:47:09] <%StrawberryPantsu> BotW Spoiled you....
[2:47:11] <%FuzzTime> @PatStaresAt I'm the exact same way with Zelda games tbh
[2:47:11] <%ShinobiPhoenix> I hardly understood JRPGs until Super Mario RPG, and they have been a favorite genre choice for me since. it's not RPGs or JRPGs, it's that Cyber Sleuth specifically I was bored even watching someone play. It's not the only "popular" RPG I ended up not liking. I don't like Xenoblade Chronicles 2 (and own it and was excited for it).
[2:47:11] <+Novembermagnus> It's cuz you're getting old.
[2:47:11] <%mister___doctor> They dont hit from the back
[2:47:11] <Grandma_Amari> To be fair they're not for everyone
[2:47:12] <%BinaryFireball> its a big nostalgia
[2:47:12] <ChungusQuest> NEVER TRUST HYPE
[2:47:12] <Blank9> Stream all of Shining Force 2!
[2:47:14] <+dashdodger> this ones pretty meh not gonna lie
[2:47:15] <heuristicfailure> That's fair
[2:47:15] <@SoFarFetched> It's probably somewhere in the subreddit Pat,You've seen how that shit goes sometimes.
[2:47:16] <%Sol_Install> it's really not taht great
[2:47:16] <Zebens> probably because Breath of the WIld set a new standard
[2:47:17] <%BoxNavy> we like the story. the overall game is just aight
[2:47:17] <%Aydarkzero> i never finished this one
[2:47:17] <$Afterman_> this one not great
[2:47:17] <NitronStreams> I'd agree with that sentiment
[2:47:18] <Broken_Sonex> You wanna play A Link to the Past
[2:47:18] <+eanscrale> It's mostly nostalgia
[2:47:19] <ape_hawk> go back to Wasteland 3, scrub
[2:47:19] <$Afterman_> neither is botw tho
[2:47:19] <%Taisuru> It's overrated but still good
[2:47:19] <%greasypete00> it definitely hits harder as a kid or young teenager
[2:47:22] <%BinaryFireball> the game is dated and simple
[2:47:24] <%Agami23> it was a solid GB game but i dont know if it holds up as a console release
[2:47:25] <blackbookalpha> It's no God Hand
[2:47:25] <%VoidBaronJules> this one has a major drop off point
[2:47:25] <@StridentSong> Give me Link to the Past in this engine
[2:47:26] <%SirGO0SE> it you expected anything more than what a great gameboy game is that's on you man
[2:47:26] <%GeneralSCPatton> @kghaleon This came out after that
[2:47:26] <%ShinobiPhoenix> games after 1993 kind of spoil you
[2:47:26] <%damienlunas> It's pretty good, but for the time it was literally one of the best games out there.
[2:47:27] <majindusto> NO FUN ALLOWED
[2:47:27] <%Dakuu75> A zelda game, with more of the same formula? who'd-a-thunk-it
[2:47:28] <%ssjklyco> It's the Demon's Souls Remake of a GB game.
[2:47:30] <HexMasterMike> They're all pretty much the same. At least stuff like Majora's Mask and Wind Waker get weird with it.
[2:47:30] <%Emperor_Machinus> Yeah Shining Force 2!
[2:47:33] <ShichiNoBushi> Link's Awakening's good. I really like the Oracles games.
[2:47:33] <DraxTD> well pat you hate banjo kazooie, so of chorse you'd dislike this
[2:47:36] <%cervidaequus> Its just a gameboy game but peeps love it
[2:47:36] <s1rcuit> @PatStaresAt to me it's probably the most overrated Zelda game, tied with Skyward Sword
[2:47:38] <%BoxNavy> but wheremst
[2:47:40] <+Chester_goes_Berserk> I think the ending leaves a really good impression
[2:47:41] <%AncelDeLambert> isn't the reason people like this one because it's wierd?
[2:47:41] <%LaughingCatt> Nostalgia is a powerful drug & usually disappointing to those not on it
[2:47:43] <RetributionP> of the older games I prefer orical of seasons or ages
[2:47:43] <NitronStreams> The internet has ruined so many things for me with overhye
[2:47:46] <+sixcubit> i love zelda but the combat Is Fundamentally Bad
[2:47:50] <%DakotaMacDoodle> just dig all of the earth
[2:47:51] <blue2red> my cheeks are pissed off now boy
[2:47:54] <@SSaryn> Dig out the whole island
[2:47:56] <%ggbhtg> This is one of Simmons's favorite games ever, and I don't get it
[2:47:56] <%Zundelle> I don't understand any love for Link's Awakening that's not people enjoying playing a zelda game on a handheld way back
[2:47:56] <marvel877> People, or Simmons over at YoVideogames, because that guy practically jerks it to this one because it was his first Zelda.
[2:48:01] <%sonofthedeepsouth> UP
[2:48:02] <%goose_attack_almanac> I like it for what it is at the time
[2:48:03] <Broken_Sonex> This game's simplicity makes it dated.
[2:48:04] <%ShinobiPhoenix> I loved Link's Awakening as a child, but it is not myh favorite Zelda
[2:48:05] <jumpyhugs> shell later
[2:48:07] <NitronStreams> LUL
[2:48:11] <%BoxNavy> yes
[2:48:13] <Kghaleon> Nope, just a big brain

[2:48:25] <TheDuelistsChapeau> bomb hole
[2:48:25] <Blank9> this was a way better zelda than super mario land was a mario game
[2:48:25] <ape_hawk> pat, you cant solve all your problems with time stop
[2:48:25] <%BinaryFireball> this is the game you played when your parents left you in the car for 3 hours
[2:48:25] <jfp4life> It's mostly nostalgia and the ending for this game really
[2:48:28] <Blank9> that's the context of it
[2:48:29] <+TheNewZealandStory> maybe something about that hole
[2:48:31] <deeewooh> the thing with this game is that it was amazing that you were playing something like this on gameboy hardware.
[2:48:35] <%BoxNavy> :O
[2:48:42] <%Aydarkzero> a dungeon PogChamp
[2:48:43] <Kghaleon> He already has the timestop
[2:48:45] <%Emperor_Machinus> @ShinobiPhoenix Those are my favorite Zelda games
[2:48:51] <TallGuyWithAHoodie> Oracle of Seasons was great. Oracle of Ages is diet Ocarina of Time.

[2:49:05] <Broken_Sonex> @BinaryFireball Speaking from experience?
[2:49:06] <Pookiedaexzile> Thing about this game is its pokemon with real time combat

[2:49:11] <%FuzzTime> Clap
[2:49:11] <%Aydarkzero> actual 5Head

[2:49:12] <Zebens> EZ
[2:49:13] <Is_Nation> @ShinobiPhoenix Then i just dunno what to tell ya man. Guess it just aint for everyone. The persona comparison threw me off though because to my knowledge they barely have anything in common
[2:49:14] <%Zeikier> THAT'S HOW YOU DO IT!?
[2:49:16] <TioXyco> sure yu are
[2:49:16] <Northward12> that oine took me way too long
[2:49:17] <marvel877> IT CAN THINK
[2:49:18] <NitronStreams> You... did it
[2:49:21] <meromaromiro> Maybe ask Paige next time?
[2:49:21] <%Zundelle> Oh no what if I don't like Kirby's Amazing Mirror as much as I remembered
[2:49:23] <%BoxNavy> Jebaited
[2:49:25] <ape_hawk> oh, so THATS why its called a bomb-pussy
[2:49:26] <rasamune> where it go
[2:49:28] <KeiPrime> got that one but the gravestones
[2:49:29] <%averyoddjew> that on has nothing
[2:49:30] <%greasypete00> guess nothing's there
[2:49:30] <Zebens> Jebaited
[2:49:30] <+ianabstract> @deeewooh Yeah, the scope of this on a gameboy was mind boggling. It was months of bus rides worth
[2:49:35] <%AncelDeLambert> Minnish Cap is probably better than this, but both were so long ago I have no conclusive idea
[2:49:35] <+Novembermagnus> "Where's the ka-boom?"
[2:49:36] <DraxTD> you got to let the bomb cook some @PatStaresAt
[2:49:42] <majindusto> WHERE'S THE KABOOM?
[2:49:47] <%ggbhtg> no happun sajamMouse sajamMouse sajamMouse
[2:49:48] <Haklex> I think another part of it is that this and aLttP defined the Zelda formula for years
[2:49:56] <%BoxNavy> minish cap is for sure better than this
[2:49:58] <TioXyco> there should have been a world shattering kaboom!
[2:49:59] <%Dementedpenguin> @Zundelle Either keep your nostalgia or gamble with a new playthrough Kappa
[2:50:02] <Mangahero18> Minish Cap was amazing. I put it above BoTW on my Zelda list.
[2:50:03] <DraxTD> huh that usualy works
[2:50:03] <%king_wragles> psa1guy
[2:50:04] <%ShinobiPhoenix> at this point, my favorite "classic" style Zeldas are Majora, Link Between and Minish Cap
[2:50:05] <%Taisuru> lies
[2:50:05] <%BoxNavy> pats whens the minish cap stream
[2:50:06] <+lethallylactic> Jebaited
[2:50:10] <%greasypete00> I don't think anything is in there
[2:50:11] <%Dwarven_Gaming> Dwarven_Gaming subscribed at Tier 1. They've subscribed for 10 months, currently on a 2 month streak! heres to 2021 not literatley on fire
[2:50:12] <%averyoddjew> it's not
[2:50:12] <+dashdodger> minish cap is great
[2:50:13] <%GeneralSCPatton> Picking it up resets the cooking
[2:50:15] <Kghaleon> chat lying
[2:50:18] <%BoxNavy> minish cap is my favourite one
[2:50:20] <%FuzzTime> Minish Cap has always been my favourite 2D Zelda
[2:50:28] <Blank9> link between worlds is great because it's so fast paced
[2:50:30] <ManfredA> where's Pat's playthrough of Majora's Mask aka Pat dies of time management stress
[2:50:32] <DraxTD> pat's crazy talk infects chat?
[2:50:33] <Blank9> you just go and go
[2:50:34] <%DakotaMacDoodle> Minnish Cap is my fav 2d Zelda to be honest
[2:50:35] <dinnydanny777> Have you tried jumping in?
[2:50:38] <%ggbhtg> So The Lock is your fav because it exemplifies the appeal of Stands to you? Would you show someone that episode to sell them on Jojo? @patstaresat
[2:50:43] <marvel877> I want to replay Minish Cap, but I need to fix my GBA.
[2:50:47] <ExpressNode> Phantom Hourglass was ass
[2:50:49] <Mangahero18> Link must be really strong if he can pick up boulders the same size as him.
[2:51:01] <Kghaleon> Last couple of dungeons took me a long time.
[2:51:02] <%BoxNavy> @ManfredA oh god i cant play majoras mask exactly because of this
[2:51:04] <%Zundelle> @Dementedpenguin alright I'm always down to gamble good feelings away
[2:51:13] <%Dementedpenguin> LUL
[2:51:29] <+hailinpea> I LOVE IT
[2:51:30] <Profmcstevie> No THIS game it's the same song
[2:51:32] <ManfredA> this is weak baitg
[2:51:33] <Blank9> oot had good music for each area though
[2:51:33] <%BoxNavy> gameboy limitations jermaPluto
[2:51:33] <+Genericho> 182 hours of hyrule field theme
[2:51:34] <+Novembermagnus> ...
[2:51:35] <ManfredA> *bait
[2:51:36] <Glassbrain> the GBA link games are bad for this.
[2:51:36] <%Zeikier> if you think that's bad, Link to the Past is AWFUL about that
[2:51:37] <%ggbhtg> oh no my secret technique hath been revealed
[2:51:40] <%BinaryFireball> gameboy did not have a lot of memory for more songs
[2:51:41] <%BigCoffee> Pat its a Gameboy game
[2:51:41] <DickieWoodsmall_279> I like the idea of it being situational and playing different parts of the song in a different order
[2:51:43] <%sonofthedeepsouth> LUL
[2:51:43] <dinnydanny777> Wouldn't be a problem if they played other music
[2:51:43] <%wibbwobbler> pretty catchy tho
[2:51:44] <%naph_runs> I was gonna say it‚Äôs getting pretty old
[2:51:44] <%FuzzTime> The only overworld song I can listen to for an entire game in this series is Wind Waker's
[2:51:44] <marvel877> Majora's Mask was done by this game's scenario writer.
[2:51:46] <+sixcubit> what are leitmotifs?????????????
[2:51:48] <%Zeikier> that lousy game has like 3 tracks ever and they all stink
[2:51:48] <%ShinobiPhoenix> @Is_Nation Persona/SMT like battle system. my enjoy at leastt in RPGs now come from not just the story, but also the battle mechanics. after so many years, I get tired of the same elements and same way of playing AFTER playing so many new ways and making new ways for games I myself make
[2:51:49] <%BigCoffee> you baiter
[2:51:53] <%Futurecity10> How about making good music
[2:51:53] <Kghaleon> Game is like 10 hours, so not really that bad.
[2:51:54] <Glassbrain> the the game boy links have like, seven tracks
[2:51:55] <majindusto> OH HERE WE GO...WE SHITTING ON ZELDA MUSIC NOW
[2:51:55] <TioXyco> like every zelda game has ever been, sincealways
[2:51:59] <%king_wragles> The music in other Zeldas is a bit more varied, but ya this one has one song
[2:52:05] <jcflyguy> I could stay in ALttP's Dark World forever, that song is the best.
[2:52:08] <rosemon5001> i sense high suck energy from that temple entance
[2:52:08] <DickieWoodsmall_279> though a lot of people don't notice that the song randomly remixes itself
[2:52:10] <%naph_runs> I wish it wasn‚Äôt so constant
[2:52:13] <Mangahero18> It was the wrong decision. Like everything else about BoTW
[2:52:14] <TallGuyWithAHoodie> Unpopular opinion: As great as BotW was, in hindsight there are a ton of things I hate about it. Lack of OST is one of tbeme
[2:52:16] <tattleworm> you're right, prelude is also bad
[2:52:17] <+Chester_goes_Berserk> ocarina of time never played the main zelda theme and it was great
[2:52:20] <%king_wragles> No wait, this one has 2. Ballad of the Windfish counts
[2:52:22] <Glassbrain> you think this is bad, the remake ADDS music
[2:52:28] <Grandma_Amari> I guess as a remake they didn't want to change the sound track too much, there's Zelda games with pretty varied tracks in comparison
[2:52:28] <%Zundelle> I understand the choice but I wish I liked the music in BotW more when it did get to more hype moments
[2:52:29] <%BoxNavy> all the game boy zelda games have this problem sadly
[2:52:30] <%ShinobiPhoenix> one of my random hobbies now is writing up Resource Mechanics to use in future game ideas
[2:52:30] <Kghaleon> Wasn't pat playing Stardew at some point?
[2:52:31] <+twohitgood> leit motif are recurring melodies or harmonic voicings.
[2:52:35] <Manwad> think the 4 Lord Gwyn notes
[2:52:36] <%DakotaMacDoodle> yeah that's fair other Zelda do it better,
[2:52:41] <%astuteabberation> @sixcubit a couple notes or a measure meant to represent a character or concept in a greater work
[2:52:46] <%BoxNavy> :)
[2:52:47] <Hellarussian> glub glub
[2:52:49] <%sonofthedeepsouth> LUL
[2:52:51] <DickieWoodsmall_279> BotW has the best theme of any Zelda game, change my mind
[2:52:51] <%AncelDeLambert> bblbplblubblblblb
[2:52:51] <Zebens> LUL
[2:52:51] <+HiroTSK5> There are different songs that play between the south half of the overworld and the north half.
[2:52:57] <%Dakuu75> kill me
[2:52:57] <TioXyco> oh no
[2:52:59] <%BoxNavy> thats crazy
[2:53:00] <%Monkeyweed21> Link's nuts are too big he cant swim @PatStaresAt
[2:53:00] <ExpressNode> Oh fuck
[2:53:04] <goblinpuppy> I think the music is only like that in this and the original game. They learned their lessen eventually
[2:53:04] <Is_Nation> @ShinobiPhoenix You mean turn based combat? I don't think Persona invented that lol
[2:53:08] <NenaFan101> Wait until the next area
[2:53:09] <%Emperor_Machinus> everyone loves it
[2:53:09] <Supabait> water is the greatest beverage of all time
[2:53:12] <%AncelDeLambert> I reiterate: I don't get the hate for the Ocarina water temple, I just DON'T
[2:53:12] <%averyoddjew> this isn't the "water temple"
[2:53:13] <NenaFan101> He's going to have a grand ol' time
[2:53:18] <%averyoddjew> the next one
[2:53:20] <%Srthunda> I still do not understand everyones hatred for water based temples
[2:53:20] <ancrest_tant> From a composer‚Äôs perspective it was revolutionary for having interactive music that changes as you play. That being said, it‚Äôs a tad too repetitive
[2:53:21] <%BoxNavy> ill say it the fire temple is worse than the water temple
[2:53:23] <%astuteabberation> The first couple notes of the spider-man theme could be interpreted as a leitmotif if you used it right
[2:53:24] <+worldbrand> botw's got music where it counts. just play ocarina and remove the music from hyrule field and you have about equal representation
[2:53:34] <%ShinobiPhoenix> I am kind of over "baseline" MP meter that empties and doesn't self-refill.
[2:53:38] <+Novembermagnus> Pat did you ever play the Samus Returns remake on 3ds? How does this stack up to that as a gameboy remake?
[2:53:44] <+sixcubit> who could forget Link's classic quotes, such as *drowns*
[2:53:45] <%AncelDeLambert> Bolero of Fire is the best song, tho
[2:53:46] <%Houndemise> Pat, do you enjoy any of the 3D Zeldas?
[2:53:48] <M0untain_wolf> the smallest of keys
[2:53:49] <ExpressNode> Water temple in Twilight Princess also sucked
[2:53:57] <majindusto> Poor Link...Pat Keeps Drowning him
[2:54:03] <%Zundelle> I also love it for Majora's Mask because it's slightly maddening after a while which fits
[2:54:09] <+twohitgood> so this dungeon is the french horn, then? since the song prominently features a french horn?
[2:54:11] <Is_Nation> Fair enough honestly. But "if it aint broke" is the MP standard thought process
[2:54:16] <%Dwarven_Gaming> 3ds port?
[2:54:17] <s1rcuit> I like MM more the OoT
[2:54:18] <%Srthunda> link's crossbow training is the best one, obv
[2:54:18] <%Trenr> oh hell yes
[2:54:20] <dinnydanny777> PogChamp
[2:54:22] <heuristicfailure> This game was awesome with it's variety of music back when it came out. the Zelda's before this basically had overworld and dungeon themes, and that's it.
[2:54:24] <Kemmybelle> yay
[2:54:25] <%BoxNavy> do 3ds
[2:54:27] <DickieWoodsmall_279> BotW's music sets the mood very well, and having it change and alter itself to fit what's happening on screen is brilliant, you're insane
[2:54:27] <Supabait> WW and TP are my favorites GC era of 3d zelda was so good
[2:54:27] <%Emperor_Machinus> I like Majora's Mask
[2:54:27] <Mangahero18> I disliked Twilight Princess in general. Midna was the only saving grace for that game.
[2:54:27] <%Trenr> I would love to see MM
[2:54:28] <Kghaleon> 3DS version is way superior
[2:54:28] <ManfredA> Termina Field's theme is sick
[2:54:30] <%king_wragles> 3DS with patch is the way to go
[2:54:32] <+twohitgood> i think majora's mask might mess with your OCD
[2:54:33] <dinnydanny777> The swimming is worse on 3DS :(
[2:54:35] <marvel877> There's a reason the Water Temple in OoT had guidelines for the water levels in 3DS.
[2:54:35] <NenaFan101> Tri Force Heroes is going to end up with the Oracle games and Adventure of Link as the forgotten/unwanted entries
[2:54:35] <%averyoddjew> 3ds port is a good port
[2:54:35] <+ShinobiPhoenix> @Is_Nation no, not turn based. I guess it;s hard to explain without getting into the weed's like a game designer thinks. for example (that I was already talking about), resource systems are not a turn-on or turn-off at this point in my life since I am critical of it in my own work
[2:54:39] <%RetroCop87> The Oracle games are a step up from Link's Awakening, but stuck on the GBC
[2:54:40] <%AncelDeLambert> I, similarly, appreciate Wind Waker, but don't personally care for it
[2:54:40] <pokefan9956> majora I always feel needs a remake. that game's story and aesthetic is top tier, but there's just a ton of stuff that brings it down
[2:54:44] <Kemmybelle> No, don't do 3ds MM
[2:54:44] <%BoxNavy> im surprised pat likes wind waker
[2:54:44] <%za7az> Majora's Mask is my favourite zelda game
[2:54:48] <%sonofthedeepsouth> PAT LOVES IT
[2:54:48] <rosemon5001> do you not like twilight princess because of all the porn? @PatStaresAt
[2:54:48] <%BoxNavy> idk why
[2:54:49] <Kghaleon> 3DS port added some good shit
[2:54:50] <+sixcubit> i love Twilight Princess but absolutely get why everyone hates it
[2:54:50] <%king_wragles> Just cheat through the Tri force section?
[2:54:50] <+worldbrand> MM has a GC port on some disk doesnt it?
[2:54:51] <+Br0kuyasu> isnt the 3ds version baby mode?
[2:54:52] <goblinpuppy> Yeah I appreciated Majora much more as an adult. Time shit intimidated me as a kid
[2:54:54] <%Trenr> Wind Waker version is infinitely superior, Triforce quest is basically just dungeon length
[2:54:56] <Hellarussian> Twilight Princess was dank
[2:54:58] <Zebens> what about Phantom Hourglass?
[2:55:00] <+Dova573> GREAT
[2:55:03] <anAngryHamster> I legitimately don't understand the frustration with the Fridge quest
[2:55:04] <%FuzzTime> Wind Waker is my favourite Zelda Game but the triforce quest is bullshit 100%
[2:55:05] <marvel877> Pat, I think your mindgoblins will kick your ass in Majora's Mask.
[2:55:05] <Profmcstevie> I love Twilight, I think it's a mediocre game
[2:55:06] <NenaFan101> @worldbrand Yeah, but it was optimized like crap
[2:55:07] <%ggbhtg> They slimmed it tho
[2:55:08] <%rumtumtugnutz> Zelda 2 is my favorite Zelda game.
[2:55:10] <KosOrSomeSayKosm_> the MIDNA GAME
[2:55:11] <%Agami23> yeah
[2:55:12] <NenaFan101> And I HAD that disc
[2:55:13] <Glassbrain> twilight princess is a game.
[2:55:15] <ape_hawk> twilight princess sucks ass
[2:55:16] <%ShinobiPhoenix> not = now
[2:55:18] <%king_wragles> Twilight Princess is great, just don't think about that part before the end
[2:55:19] <marvel877> kinda, yeah.
[2:55:20] <majindusto> Phantom Hourglass and Spirit Tracks are great too
[2:55:21] <%FuzzTime> JUSTICE FOR ZELDA 2
[2:55:21] <TallGuyWithAHoodie> The more hindsight I get on it, the more I wish Breath of the Wild was less like itself and more like a generic action game :/
[2:55:21] <+Ilpala> best companion though
[2:55:23] <%Tearonex> fair
[2:55:23] <+Novembermagnus> Let's just not talk about Skyward Sword.
[2:55:24] <%Emperor_Machinus> Cool visuals, gameplay is ehh?
[2:55:24] <Broken_Sonex> Twilight is overrated
[2:55:25] <%BoxNavy> THEYRE TERRIBLE
[2:55:25] <%cervidaequus> Phantom Hourglass?
[2:55:26] <%Agami23> people only like twilight princess for midna
[2:55:29] <Kghaleon> That's like every game
[2:55:32] <%rumtumtugnutz> Twilight Princess would have been better without the weight of Zelda.
[2:55:33] <NenaFan101> It was the mid 2000s, everything had to look that way
[2:55:34] <%Monkeyweed21> Malo is god
[2:55:37] <NenaFan101> It aged like crap
[2:55:38] <+dashdodger> yeah they're fucking freaks
[2:55:39] <ExpressNode> It was pretty bland. But the coolest thing is the mirrored versions
[2:55:40] <%Muffinmastr> humanity is full of monsters
[2:55:41] <Glassbrain> twilight princess needed to focus itself in a bit more than it did
[2:55:45] <%Monkeyweed21> Inbred farming town
[2:55:45] <DickieWoodsmall_279> because they live in the boonies and they're all inbred hicks
[2:55:45] <%sonofthedeepsouth> PEOPLE LIKE TP BECAUSE SHORTSTACK AND THAT IS FINE
[2:55:45] <%the_krypto_knight> I think twilight has some great dungeons
[2:55:46] <filialpails> WELCOME IN MALO MART
[2:55:46] <nivlac_555> Looking forward to the BotW sequel?
[2:55:47] <%ShinobiPhoenix> I still like Twilight Princess, but it's not the BEST Zelda, but it's Zelda's like the Rule of Pizza
[2:55:48] <%damienlunas> Monsters...? They look like *monsters* to you?
[2:55:49] <majindusto> MIDNA THO lytHI
[2:55:51] <%BoxNavy> its an asspull for sure
[2:55:53] <%Zeikier> yeah ganon did not need to come at the end of TP
[2:55:54] <%wibbwobbler> used to say windwaker was best, i really appreciate ocarina now
[2:55:54] <%VoidBaronJules> powder the skull buttrryflies
[2:55:55] <%Zeikier> right???
[2:55:55] <Is_Nation> @ShinobiPhoenix Right i get ya. So it's not so much the battle system but more the mechanics that baseline most modern RPGs
[2:55:56] <%astuteabberation> Why did they feel the need to model the goron's rock nipples
[2:55:59] <%AncelDeLambert> yeah, the Twili were enough, we didn't need the God Ganon thing
[2:56:00] <+Ilpala> nah ganon in TP is an asspull for sure
[2:56:00] <Glassbrain> twilight princess introduces items and then they become useless for 99% of the game outside the dungeon you get them in
[2:56:00] <deeewooh> nah a lot of people didn't like ganondorf out of nowhere
[2:56:01] <%kewlmyc> Not really. Most people agree it should have just been Zant
[2:56:01] <Profmcstevie> I like his TP design, he didn't need to hijack the plot
[2:56:02] <NitronStreams> Yeah Zant was robbed
[2:56:02] <%greasypete00> I hate what happens to zant
[2:56:02] <TallGuyWithAHoodie> Twilight Princess is a 7.5/10 but Midna is a 12/10
[2:56:03] <+twohitgood> ganon does feel like a shoe-in
[2:56:04] <%W1nterTitan> That's fair
[2:56:04] <%CzeekyPlays> agreed
[2:56:04] <Glassbrain> and that's the fuckign WORST
[2:56:05] <goblinpuppy> YEAHH I was sad when Zant took the mask off
[2:56:06] <%ClericOfSparda> I like TP and the story, but the character designs were fucked. and yeah, Zant could have carried that game alone
[2:56:06] <marvel877> Right up till he took the helmet off
[2:56:09] <Glassbrain> the spinner could have been COOL
[2:56:09] <Kemmybelle> It's their answer to the people crying over WW "kiddie" graphics.
[2:56:09] <+worldbrand> i actually liked that zant was a pissbaby, but he stopped being a threat at the same time
[2:56:10] <%VoidBaronJules> *butterflies
[2:56:10] <%sonofthedeepsouth> Shortacks make it all worth it
[2:56:11] <%Zeikier> like TP felt held back by what it thought it needed to be a Zelda title
[2:56:11] <NenaFan101> You know what was a great Zelda villain? Bellum
[2:56:11] <%Dakuu75> this coming from the guy who said on the podcast "I need dracula in my castelvania game"
[2:56:12] <%Emperor_Machinus> But his evil god was Gannon
[2:56:13] <%GeneralSCPatton> Oops, all Ganon Keikakus
[2:56:14] <Glassbrain> but the spinner was instead TRASH
[2:56:15] <+Dova573> idk man Twilight princess has a hove board
[2:56:16] <ShichiNoBushi> I liked Zant when he was mysterious and not a weirdo.
[2:56:17] <+TheNewZealandStory> basically every 3d zelda game made after majora's mask sucks
[2:56:18] <+Ilpala> like, how do you beat WW Ganon?
[2:56:18] <Kghaleon> Windwaker final boss was the best one
[2:56:18] <%Bane_Kaikyo> abwoblblblblbl
[2:56:19] <NenaFan101> That thing was just a pure embodiment of evil
[2:56:22] <%Houndemise> I was actually let down by Ganon too
[2:56:23] <Grandma_Amari> Zant was SO COOL
[2:56:25] <+dashdodger> feels like zant was supposed to be the big bad but then a higher up at nintendo said where's ganon tho
[2:56:25] <%AncelDeLambert> that gear thing
[2:56:25] <NitronStreams> SPINNER
[2:56:27] <+twohitgood> ganon feels like an insert rather than a natural part of the story.
[2:56:27] <NenaFan101> Had no motivation but to consume and destroy
[2:56:30] <Profmcstevie> That's a GENERAL zelda issue
[2:56:31] <%Agami23> the fucking spinner
[2:56:34] <Saltmeisterr> dominion rod?
[2:56:34] <%ggbhtg> Twilight Princess, I never hear any particular praise. Midna thirst is real, but thats a separate phenomenon
[2:56:35] <marvel877> Dominion Rod
[2:56:35] <+Ilpala> WW Ganon is the coolest thing that has ever come out of that entire franchise
[2:56:37] <%damienlunas> Big Same.
[2:56:37] <%Emperor_Machinus> Bayblade!
[2:56:37] <Mangahero18> BoTW is ALSO the only Modern Zelda game where you dont have a companion on your journey. If you count the boat from WW anyway.
[2:56:38] <%AncelDeLambert> oh, that thing
[2:56:38] <%DakotaMacDoodle> Spinner man useless
[2:56:38] <%GeneralSCPatton> It was the Spinner
[2:56:38] <Explodincatz> rod and spinner
[2:56:39] <%goose_attack_almanac> the spinner
[2:56:43] <%the_krypto_knight> Speaking of which. I look CS BOTW but the beast ganon fight is such a bad ending
[2:56:44] <KeiPrime> SUmo MINIGAME
[2:56:45] <Glassbrain> they shoehorn it into an overworld puzzle
[2:56:46] <+Novembermagnus> Thats a problem in every 3d Zelda
[2:56:46] <TallGuyWithAHoodie> You m3qn the DOMINION ROD?
[2:56:46] <majindusto> Ganondorf was cool in Twilight Princess tho
[2:56:49] <nivlac_555> spinner was the epitome
[2:56:49] <Kghaleon> Spirit tracks was the worst zelda.
[2:56:50] <heuristicfailure> the spinner was rad for that one boss though
[2:56:50] <%astuteabberation> THE DOMINION ROD WAS SUCH A COOL FUCKING IDEA THEY COULD'VE DID SOME NEAT SHIT WITH THAT
[2:56:50] <$Afterman_> yo the spinner was fun as fuck though
[2:56:50] <%AncelDeLambert> the animus rod was pretty lame, yeah
[2:56:51] <%GeneralSCPatton> THE SPINNER SHOULD HAVE BEEN FASTER AND COOLER
[2:56:53] <Grandma_Amari> The fucking boomerang was cool but uuuuuugh
[2:56:53] <%rumtumtugnutz> I hated ther fuckin beyblade
[2:56:53] <%FuzzTime> @Ilpala agreed
[2:56:53] <%averyoddjew> but the ball n chain tho
[2:56:53] <Supabait> weeb ganon in ww PogChamp
[2:56:54] <Is_Nation> hey man the spinner was cool
[2:56:55] <Sowlith> skyward sword?
[2:56:55] <ExpressNode> I think ALttP has one of the best use of out of dungeon weapons
[2:56:56] <%CzeekyPlays> They all had overworld stuff to do with them, but it was pretty limited
[2:56:57] <%tinyswampthing> my zelda tastes are wack i dont like mm but love tp to death
[2:56:58] <Zebroneath> Double Claw Shot got the most play
[2:56:58] <+Dova573> That spinner dungeon was the best doe
[2:56:59] <Mangahero18> Spinner was the coolest but most useless weapon ever.
[2:57:05] <Kemmybelle> ridin' spinner. I think you use once outside the dungeon to get a heart piece.
[2:57:06] <ManfredA> perspective?
[2:57:06] <Profmcstevie> It's a shame cos the SECOND you get to Hyrule Field you wanna ride that fucking Spinner dude
[2:57:07] <dinnydanny777> Zant being such a dork in Twilight Princess kind of retroactively makes Zelda less cool because she lost to him
[2:57:07] <NenaFan101> Touchscreen?
[2:57:09] <Broken_Sonex> People only like Twilight because they wanna fuck Midna. And NOT her true adult version....ugh.
[2:57:09] <Glassbrain> if you could keep the spinner at a consistent speed it would have been fine
[2:57:10] <%Houndemise> At least the spinner is kinda fun to use
[2:57:11] <%greasypete00> D's controls?
[2:57:11] <%BoxNavy> those games had cool ideas
[2:57:13] <+ShiningRaptor> touch controls?
[2:57:13] <%Agami23> phantom hour glass had one cool puzzle
[2:57:14] <+worldbrand> spirit tracks was the only zelda i ever gave up on
[2:57:15] <NitronStreams> Touch Controls
[2:57:15] <%greasypete00> ds*
[2:57:17] <%SomeSageAdvice> if they made the spinner super fast and an actual movement option, it wouldve been much better
[2:57:17] <NenaFan101> Yeah
[2:57:17] <Glassbrain> but instead it slowly stops
[2:57:24] <goblinpuppy> I wonder if the DS Zeldas would do better with a remake
[2:57:24] <Kghaleon> Also that timed dungeon
[2:57:29] <%ShinobiPhoenix> @Is_Nation I am HYPER CRITICAL of resource systems and your abilities being dependent on them while taking having to take in account the game's economy and how many time and effort you have to put in compared to what you get
[2:57:31] <%DakotaMacDoodle> Spirit tracks sucks trust me I beat that game
[2:57:32] <%greasypete00> would you play them if they got remade with better controls
[2:57:35] <%AncelDeLambert> bombs, Pat, you have bombs
[2:57:35] <Explodincatz> everything about the DS zeldas were terrible
[2:57:45] <NenaFan101> Bellum > Malladus
[2:57:45] <%Bane_Kaikyo> Phantom Hourglass was fine..... Spirit tracks was ASS
[2:57:48] <NenaFan101> That's just me
[2:57:48] <%BoxNavy> spirit tracks has a really good zelda at least
[2:57:53] <majindusto> I recently played Phantom hourglass and Spirit Tracks for the first time ever...I LOVED THEM
[2:57:58] <%greasypete00> @nenafan101 correct
[2:58:01] <+Novembermagnus> I remember thinking the the Megaton Hammer in OoT was the raddest shit ever. I was so dissapointet that I barely got to use it outside of the Fire Temple.
[2:58:08] <%Broand> Are those the slimes from stardew valley
[2:58:11] <%CapnClassix> There are DPAD Hacks for both
[2:58:13] <NenaFan101> @BoxNavy That Zelda is a spoiled brat thrusted into the role of heroine
[2:58:14] <%DakotaMacDoodle> not worth it
[2:58:17] <Glassbrain> that would require an overhaul at the basic level
[2:58:18] <Drivershaft> there is, mods exist to change the movement
[2:58:19] <marvel877> Probably.
[2:58:22] <%Pulsewing> I can't imagine it would be very easy
[2:58:28] <goblinpuppy> If I could use a controller I'd definitely be more interested in them
[2:58:31] <%FacetiousAF> you have to dab them off psaDab
[2:58:31] <%ShinobiPhoenix> way too many games now are still just lazily doing things the old ways and not improving and calling it "classic" when we have done things better by now
[2:58:34] <Kghaleon> get fucked
[2:58:34] <%SomeSageAdvice> even if you fixed the controls, Phantom Hourglass is NOT worth playing in my opinion
[2:58:38] <%AncelDeLambert> wowzers
[2:58:42] <%Houndemise> Understandable, I think the DS games aren‚Äôt that good too
[2:58:44] <%BoxNavy> @NenaFan101 yeah its great. i like it at least
[2:58:45] <%SomeSageAdvice> Spirit Tracks i never touched
[2:58:47] <ExpressNode> I'm surprised no one talks about the other GBA Zelda games. I never played them but I heard people say they were good
[2:58:55] <NenaFan101> Eh... I'd say Phantom Hourglass would be worth playing if you fixed the controls
[2:59:00] <NenaFan101> However, Spirit Tracks
[2:59:08] <NenaFan101> Because everything is stuck on literal train tracks
[2:59:08] <marvel877> I like the aesthetics of the DS games, but not the stylus controls or having to blow into the mic for music stuff.
[2:59:09] <%ggbhtg> So PH and ST aren't the same Link and Zelda from Wind Waker?
[2:59:09] <%ShinobiPhoenix> I am not on this take, I like playing Phantom Hourglass and only the train part of Spirit Tracks is problematic
[2:59:09] <+trackles_64> is thos mario al of a sudden
[2:59:11] <+Novembermagnus> Yooo but the Phantom Hourglass fishing minigame tho.
[2:59:12] <%SomeSageAdvice> Minish Cap is my second favorite Zelda game
[2:59:13] <%cvp5127> the best puzzle
[2:59:16] <NenaFan101> It's not so easy
[2:59:17] <%BoxNavy> that was a big cool
[2:59:17] <%FacetiousAF> so chat what you're saying is zelda peaked at the Oracle games Kappa
[2:59:19] <%Rozalyndis> yay patrick sinvictaHi
[2:59:20] <%RetroCop87> You can jump on Goombas in the side scrolling sections
[2:59:21] <%Bane_Kaikyo> Phantom Hourglass was actually good
[2:59:23] <Glassbrain> blow into the microphone puzzle
[2:59:23] <pokefan9956> phantom hourglass was cool with being able to draw notes on the map
[2:59:26] <valriot> Literally hop into the stream to him shitting on PH
[2:59:26] <%Pulsewing> Phantom Hourglass and Spirit Tracks arent for everyone
[2:59:28] <%VoidBaronJules> found a patch for spirit tracks
[2:59:29] <Sowlith> spirit tracks broke when i played it cause the stupid flute mic gimmick stopped working at one point entirely
[2:59:30] <Mangahero18> I dont like how you cant just hit jars to break them in older zelda games. I feel like thats an innovation thats frequently overlooked in the modern games.
[2:59:30] <%Houndemise> You need the flippers to swim, I think
[2:59:31] <NenaFan101> Phantom Hourglass gives you some freedom of movement
[2:59:31] <Blank9> linebeck was cool
[2:59:32] <ManfredA> I hate those gimmicks because Pokemon ruined them
[2:59:32] <%VioletHeart> Phantom Hourglass is probably the only Zelda game I can confidently say I enjoyed.
[2:59:33] <%SomeSageAdvice> @ggbhtg PH yes, Spirit Tracks no
[2:59:33] <%Rozalyndis> false statement Bane_Kaikyo
[2:59:34] <Onatamana> I HATED THAT PUZZLE
[2:59:35] <Is_Nation> @Is_Nation Admittedly i never really look into that all that much but i can see how it can grow tiresome if you really pay attention to how little effort is put into making these old systems more fresh
[2:59:35] <%ShinobiPhoenix> the mic part sucks, but I like drawing the controls of teh boomerang and items
[2:59:36] <+worldbrand> what other gba zeldas? there's minish cap and four swords
[2:59:40] <%ShinobiPhoenix> and drawing clues on the map
[2:59:41] <%averyoddjew> the oracle games are pretty good
[2:59:41] <+Novembermagnus> Best fishing in any Zelda.
[2:59:42] <NenaFan101> Anyway, let's talk about Tri Force Heroes
[2:59:44] <%DakotaMacDoodle> I would really like to reincorporate dungeons back into Zelda with Botw2 in some way just for better boss fights
[2:59:45] <%Rozalyndis> phourglass is one of the *worst* zeldas
[2:59:56] <%AncelDeLambert> aaaaaaah that sucks
[2:59:58] <+HiroTSK5> I want the Oracle games to be remade so we can get more people to play them. I feel like they were always overlooked
[3:00:00] <$Afterman_> pat stream minish cap
[3:00:00] <alex_xander_b> how do you feel about zelda 1?
[3:00:04] <%BoxNavy> finish it its owns
[3:00:04] <%goose_attack_almanac> It's a shame that Spirit Tracks was fuckin miserable to play, because Zelda is great in that game
[3:00:05] <NenaFan101> Single Player is miserable when you get to the later areas
[3:00:06] <Supabait> metroid fusion best gba game of all time
[3:00:06] <%ShinobiPhoenix> I love the DS/3DS era, because of drawing maps and clues on the screen
[3:00:07] <ManfredA> aren't those capcom games
[3:00:08] <+vaderxyz1970> Minish cap was one of my favorites
[3:00:08] <majindusto> I still have never touched Minish Cap or the Oracle games
[3:00:09] <ManfredA> or am I high
[3:00:10] <%RetroCop87> Enzo > Navi
[3:00:11] <%Monkeyweed21> yea Minish CAp is great
[3:00:11] <Kghaleon> Seasons games were ace
[3:00:11] <NenaFan101> SEASONS > Ages
[3:00:15] <ExpressNode> @worldbrand Sorry I meant to say GB not GBA
[3:00:16] <Make_me_mad> Breath of the Wild had god-awful boss fights. They were trash.
[3:00:17] <Glassbrain> oracle of seasons > oracle of ages
[3:00:19] <Explodincatz> Oracles are the best
[3:00:19] <%BoxNavy> man im so surprised so many people like minish cap
[3:00:20] <%FuzzTime> Big Agree
[3:00:20] <%Emperor_Machinus> The oracle games are great
[3:00:24] <dinnydanny777> I hate Spirit Tracks's flute sections after I was enjoying the game until I got stuck there for weeks because my DS microphone wouldn't pick up
[3:00:26] <%Agami23> i thought minishcap was lame right up until you get into a minecart and it zooms like a bat out of hell
[3:00:26] <+worldbrand> yeah you're right
[3:00:26] <NenaFan101> @ManfredA Yeah, and it's why we didn't get any of them in Hyrule Warriors
[3:00:27] <%Tearonex> Season and Ages were great
[3:00:27] <Profmcstevie> They are not "the bar"
[3:00:29] <rasamune> Hard agree
[3:00:29] <NenaFan101> Which sucked
[3:00:29] <%ShinobiPhoenix> Etrian Odyssey I am not good at, but I love cartography part
[3:00:30] <%Rozalyndis> oh yeah the worst thing about zelda is the fanbase
[3:00:30] <%Pulsewing> Deified
[3:00:30] <+goddamndavid> big true
[3:00:31] <%BoxNavy> yeah tahts true
[3:00:31] <%Zeikier> yeah
[3:00:32] <%VoidBaronJules> oh yeah
[3:00:32] <heuristicfailure> 8.8 IS AN OUTRAGE!
[3:00:33] <s1rcuit> that's fair
[3:00:33] <%ggbhtg> I don't remember why I played Minish Cap but I couldn't put it down at the time
[3:00:36] <%Zeikier> the average is way less than fans think
[3:00:36] <marvel877> Fair.
[3:00:37] <valriot> Its overrated, because its INCREDIBLY inconsistent
[3:00:37] <Mangahero18> The fans are total shit.
[3:00:38] <+trackles_64> Ocarina of Time is the BEST ONE EVER
[3:00:42] <NenaFan101> @dinnydanny777 Oh, you had to remind me of that garbage
[3:00:42] <Supabait> Okami is the best zelda game
[3:00:42] <%wibbwobbler> yuuuuup
[3:00:42] <%sonofthedeepsouth> people being emotional
[3:00:44] <ManfredA> Okami
[3:00:45] <%sonofthedeepsouth> no shit
[3:00:45] <%king_wragles> Dark Siders was good
[3:00:45] <%Dakuu75> there should be a zelda game where you play as ganon, and everytime you game over, Link brutally murders you for an M rating
[3:00:45] <%rumtumtugnutz> Same way people talk about Souls games
[3:00:48] <pi_in_the_sci> okami
[3:00:49] <%GeneralSCPatton> Oracles are great
[3:00:50] <KnifeyMcEdge> Immortals is fun
[3:00:51] <%BigCoffee> Alundra 1
[3:00:52] <%Emperor_Machinus> Capcom worked one the Oracle games
[3:00:53] <+maxtheflea> Okami
[3:00:53] <%Agami23> the mana series?
[3:00:54] <s_snowball> but the best zelda clone is better than all of the zelda games: okami
[3:00:55] <nivlac_555> Hyperbole? Who would do such a thing?
[3:00:56] <%arancet> okami
[3:00:56] <ManfredA> OKAMI IS GREAT
[3:00:57] <+vaderxyz1970> Darksiders
[3:00:57] <%BinaryFireball> knightn+ is pretty good but is just a small indie game
[3:00:57] <Blank9> Terranigma is good if that counts.
[3:00:57] <valriot> Okami
[3:00:59] <Make_me_mad> What about Okami? Okami is a zelda ass zelda game.
[3:01:00] <jumpyhugs> okami
[3:01:01] <Explodincatz> @dinnydanny777 u too huh? almost raged quit at that point
[3:01:01] <%shurtal> okami?
[3:01:01] <AbnormalEnd> okami and darksiders
[3:01:02] <%DakotaMacDoodle> yeah
[3:01:03] <TallGuyWithAHoodie> Oracle of Seasons is amazing. Oracle of Ages is a bad, diet Ocarina of Time.
[3:01:03] <blackbookalpha> NieR Replicant/Gestalt are Zelda clones
[3:01:04] <%greasypete00> not 2?
[3:01:04] <jfp4life> Ever play Alundra?
[3:01:05] <%AncelDeLambert> and even THAT game has problems
[3:01:09] <huskarl_zap> not 2?
[3:01:09] <%AncelDeLambert> and Okami is way too long
[3:01:10] <%BigCoffee> pat doesnt know about alundra smh
[3:01:11] <Is_Nation> Darksiders 1 and Okami are the only ones
[3:01:11] <%SirGO0SE> @PatStaresAt Minit?
[3:01:12] <jcflyguy> 3D Dot Game Heroes?
[3:01:12] <%Bane_Kaikyo> ablblbblbllblblblb
[3:01:13] <s1rcuit> Okami's great
[3:01:13] <%Tearonex> darksiders 1 LUL
[3:01:16] <%Agami23> trials of mana is a zelda clone isnt it?
[3:01:17] <%Taisuru> Darksiders 2 is good just has problems
[3:01:22] <dinnydanny777> 2 Is great too what the hell
[3:01:23] <goblinpuppy> I never really got a Zelda feel from Okami
[3:01:24] <NenaFan101> I played Alundra 2
[3:01:24] <Grandma_Amari> Fenyx Rising is apparently good but BOY was that intro scuffed.
[3:01:29] <+Ilpala> okami isn't too long if you stop the first time it ends Kappa
[3:01:29] <%Dakuu75> Okami IS long as fuck though
[3:01:30] <NenaFan101> I loved Alundra 2
[3:01:30] <TallGuyWithAHoodie> Minit is good but has its own gimmick
[3:01:31] <KeiPrime> secret of mana
[3:01:31] <+Saggitori> Binding of Isaac
[3:01:31] <%BoxNavy> i remember seeing alundra once. its cool
[3:01:31] <Kghaleon> Okami is so long I've never finished it
[3:01:31] <deeewooh> alundra isn't really a zelda like
[3:01:32] <%cvp5127> is oceanhorn good?
[3:01:33] <+Chester_goes_Berserk> beyond good and evil is also the shit
[3:01:33] <KeiPrime> ff legend
[3:01:34] <NenaFan101> Too bad nobody likes it
[3:01:34] <%rumtumtugnutz> 3D Dot Game Heroes was fuckin dumb
[3:01:36] <%AncelDeLambert> Darksiders 2 is a fucking offline MMO and complete rat trash
[3:01:38] <Is_Nation> We don't talk about Darksiders 3
[3:01:39] <heuristicfailure> Crusader of Centy was good
[3:01:40] <Glassbrain> god of war ps4
[3:01:44] <+Crasgnab> Alundra 2 was the shit
[3:01:45] <%ShinobiPhoenix> classic 2D Zelda clone, classic 3D Zelda clone or Breath of teh Wild Clone? all three are different things of varying quality
[3:01:46] <%Broand> Oh shit I should buy okami while it's on sale
[3:01:49] <%Broand> I never finished it
[3:01:49] <%DakotaMacDoodle> Darksiders 2 is just too much
[3:01:50] <%bread_assassin> Okami is the best zelda
[3:01:50] <Make_me_mad> Fenyx Rising is rad. I've put a lot of time into it.
[3:01:52] <marvel877> what was Alundra on?
[3:01:52] <%BinaryFireball> Nintendo isn't strong at game design, fight me
[3:01:53] <+worldbrand> Some of these are really really reaching if you're gonna call them zelda "clones"
[3:01:54] <KeiPrime> crusader of centy is p good from what i remember
[3:01:55] <%barkon345> Dark Souls is a zelda clone
[3:01:57] <%SirGO0SE> Minit is really good...
[3:01:59] <TallGuyWithAHoodie> You can stop playijg Okami after Okami 2. Okami 3 is not worth it.
[3:02:00] <%SaiyanShoto> Fenyx rising is a way better BOTW
[3:02:02] <blackbookalpha> Definitely a Ubisoft
[3:02:02] <+sixcubit> This dungeon really feels like "screw you for not having the dungeon item yet"
[3:02:03] <%CzeekyPlays> Whoever said NieR Gestalt/Replicant is a Zelda clone needs to get their head checked
[3:02:05] <NenaFan101> Fenix Rising is like "What if Breath of the Wild had a million icons on the map and all the characters tried to hip to the audience"
[3:02:06] <%Dementedpenguin> @marvel877 ps1
[3:02:16] <NenaFan101> You see, BOTW made you look for things
[3:02:17] <Broken_Sonex> I have already forgotten about that game
[3:02:17] <huskarl_zap> Mimir "My vision is augmented"
[3:02:23] <%ShinobiPhoenix> Fenyx Rising is better AFTER you remap litearlly 12 default controls
[3:02:23] <%BoxNavy> @Broand its on sale right now on the eshop
[3:02:26] <NenaFan101> Every Ubisoft sandbox game assumes the player drools on their shirt
[3:02:29] <dinnydanny777> But what about Genshin Impact Kappa
[3:02:32] <NenaFan101> So they tell you where you need to go
[3:02:34] <%AncelDeLambert> LUL
[3:02:34] <%Pulsewing> Have you ever seen Swords of Ditto? It's an indie Zelda roguelike and what I played of it was fun but it's super jank
[3:02:37] <olaksi> Nier has references to zelda, that's not the same as being a zelda-like
[3:02:38] <NenaFan101> Where's the fun in exploration?
[3:02:39] <%Broand> Imma just get it on steam tho
[3:02:41] <Make_me_mad> Fenyx Rising is great because the main character is a greek mythology nerd, and as a greek mythology nerd myself, I love that dumb shit.
[3:02:41] <%AncelDeLambert> Spank that 'puss
[3:02:42] <majindusto> JABU JABU MIDBOSS
[3:02:44] <NitronStreams> He got the STRATS
[3:02:44] <%ShinobiPhoenix> I LITERALLY remapped 12 different controls and the game fought me on my changes at first
[3:02:52] <rasamune> God, having a million icons on the map seems completely antithetical to the BotW experience
[3:02:56] <%SirGO0SE> me love coin keep
[3:02:58] <valriot> I dont get BOTW hate. It just feels like people whining over weapons breaking, which never matters, and combat which has NEVER BEEN GOOD IN ZELDA
[3:03:00] <TheLegendofNate> yeah flippers
[3:03:00] <%Rozalyndis> this isn't jabu-jabu no
[3:03:04] <%ShinobiPhoenix> but now I am playing it like a character action game instead and it;'s WAY better, but flawed still
[3:03:08] <+goddamndavid> he a thicc ass boy
[3:03:09] <%Dakuu75> more like jober-jober, (nailed it)
[3:03:10] <%BoxNavy> no
[3:03:13] <$Afterman_> botw has no story
[3:03:13] <goblinpuppy> Nice
[3:03:14] <%Houndemise> We can agree that skyward sword is not good, right?
[3:03:16] <NenaFan101> I like BOTW
[3:03:16] <%AncelDeLambert> BotW is EMPTY
[3:03:16] <TheLegendofNate> Yeah not for everyone
[3:03:17] <Glassbrain> twilight princess has decent combat
[3:03:18] <Grandma_Amari> Like I appreciate the idea behind a constant narration, but not when the narrators make me want to put a Tier 3 Sub in my mouth and pull the trigger
[3:03:19] <huskarl_zap> OH BOY IM SO HUNGRY I COULD EAT A AOTOROK
[3:03:20] <%Agami23> the durability genuinely ruins that game
[3:03:25] <valriot> Its LITERALLY not an issue though
[3:03:25] <%FlamingoJazz> They're weaklings.
[3:03:26] <%cvp5127> rain sucks
[3:03:27] <+twohitgood> durability fucking sucks in BotW
[3:03:27] <Kghaleon> You get weapons from everything, so it's such a non issue
[3:03:29] <TallGuyWithAHoodie> The weapons breaking mean no weapon is unique.
[3:03:30] <%averyoddjew> the durability and the lack of dungeons
[3:03:31] <%Sol_Install> Btow is the worst zelda game to me
[3:03:31] <huskarl_zap> ONLY LINK CAN DEFEAT GANNON
[3:03:33] <+vaderxyz1970> More anoying than poison
[3:03:33] <%Taisuru> Nobody would hate on BotW if the game just told you that breaking weapons upgrades the weapons in the world
[3:03:33] <%wibbwobbler> what a game
[3:03:37] <Make_me_mad> Skyward Sword is my favorite Zelda game after Wind Waker. Skyward Sword is awesome.
[3:03:37] <%BigCoffee> BOTW is a 7/10 game that only survives because it,s a Zelda game and thrives in the name. It's simply an above average open world game at best
[3:03:38] <Glassbrain> i honestly wish they'd done even more sword technique shit in twilight princess
[3:03:40] <+twohitgood> DS2 isn't as bad as BOTW's durability.
[3:03:40] <%barkon345> also the shrines all felt the same
[3:03:41] <%BoxNavy> CLIMBING IN THE RAIN
[3:03:41] <%Dakuu75> WILL those blocks crush you if you let them?
[3:03:43] <Profmcstevie> Durability does not benefit that game, you would easily use other weapons because "why the fuck not" over "well everything I have breaks"
[3:03:44] <%BoxNavy> TAHTS POISON
[3:03:44] <DuoScratch> Durability is FINE, but BotW took it WAY OVERBOARD! Everything broke so fast!
[3:03:44] <dinnydanny777> BOTW has no story, average combat, is easy without the DLC... I could go on
[3:03:45] <%SaiyanShoto> BOTW is massively overrated. People only give it a pass because it has Zelda in its name
[3:03:45] <alex_xander_b> botws ending is trash
[3:03:45] <NenaFan101> It felt realistic for a world and I liked the people living about while other Zelda games view communities as inconsequential
[3:03:45] <+ianabstract> modding durability out of BotW in emulation makes it way better
[3:03:45] <+HiroTSK5> I didn't like BotW but that's just because I don't like open-world games in general
[3:03:47] <huskarl_zap> THESE ARE THE FACES, OF EVIL
[3:03:48] <%SaiyanShoto> Lack of music
[3:03:49] <+twohitgood> it's worse than system shock 2's durability.
[3:03:51] <%goose_attack_almanac> Lack of a story
[3:03:51] <%BigCoffee> low enemy variety, few dungeons, emptyworld
[3:03:52] <%Daniel_Is_I> "Hey here's a really cool weapon you got for beating a divine beast. It'll break in 1 Lynel fight, so who fuckin cares!"
[3:03:53] <valriot> Its like say "Milk is shit by default" cos your lactose intolerant
[3:03:55] <s1rcuit> the durability makes a lot of fights pointless because you lose more than you gain
[3:03:55] <%BoxNavy> also the collectibles are boring
[3:03:56] <oceanmatt> lots of mini dungeons but few major dungeons
[3:03:59] <%DakotaMacDoodle> the Boss are not good
[3:04:00] <$Afterman_> that is correct
[3:04:01] <%Rozalyndis> botw is a great *video game* but is an absolute horrible *zelda game*
[3:04:02] <%AncelDeLambert> four, and they're SHORT, and DULL, and just awful
[3:04:03] <%Trenr> I agree with that
[3:04:04] <OkoPoko> Agreed
[3:04:04] <%barkon345> for real
[3:04:05] <deeewooh> the camel is good
[3:04:05] <marvel877> yeah.
[3:04:06] <ShichiNoBushi> 8 is a good number for dungeons.
[3:04:06] <$Afterman_> there are no good dungeons and 0 story
[3:04:07] <Kghaleon> but like 120+ mini dungeons
[3:04:07] <%VoidBaronJules> some of the worst dungeons in the series
[3:04:08] <%SaiyanShoto> There‚Äôs barely any story in it and it‚Äôs not that great
[3:04:08] <%the_krypto_knight> I think BOTW has plenty of issues that can be improved upon but I legitimately didn‚Äôt care at app about durability
[3:04:08] <%twistedj3ster> BotW isn't a Zelda game
[3:04:09] <+Novembermagnus> Did you ever play through 4 Swords Adventure, Pat?
[3:04:09] <+twohitgood> they're short and forgetable
[3:04:09] <ManfredA> eh 2 of the divine beasts are good
[3:04:09] <%BoxNavy> YEAH THEY ARE
[3:04:10] <%ShinobiPhoenix> @valriot speaking of game design practice: I love BOTW even the Weapon Dura thing, but I am also having fun writing redesigns for Weapon Dura elements to keep it around, but change it up to be more tolerant
[3:04:11] <heuristicfailure> rue
[3:04:13] <valriot> No the dungeon are FUCKING AWFUL, but the trade off is at least good
[3:04:13] <heuristicfailure> true
[3:04:13] <%Aydarkzero> i really dislike the main bosses in botw really brought the game down for me
[3:04:14] <%BinaryFireball> I hate the bosses in BOTW
[3:04:14] <%astuteabberation> BOTW's durability issue would've been much better if instead of a full break, it could be repaired
[3:04:14] <%Zundelle> Weapons breaking encourages you to switch it up but most of the weapons are the same so what's the point
[3:04:16] <TheLegendofNate> yeah
[3:04:17] <%wibbwobbler> no don't make me think lol
[3:04:19] <%FlamingoJazz> Bad ZELDA Dungeons. Good dungeons in any other game.
[3:04:19] <TallGuyWithAHoodie> The Divine Beasts are TERRIBLE dungeons
[3:04:20] <+Dova573> nah the lack and quality of dungeons in Breath of the wild is the worst part of the game
[3:04:21] <Make_me_mad> Breath of the wild has bad dungeons and bad boss fights. If the exploration wasn't fun that game would be absolute garbage.
[3:04:22] <dinnydanny777> It's not controversial
[3:04:23] <NenaFan101> Also... I hate Age of Calmaity going "Everybody gets a happy ending! What's happening in BOTW doesn't have to happen!"
[3:04:25] <%AncelDeLambert> plus the BotW bosses SUCKED
[3:04:26] <%Agami23> did you see that faces of evil got a fan remaster?
[3:04:29] <%Monkeyweed21> they're like 6-7 outta 10
[3:04:32] <Make_me_mad> But the exploration is AMAZING.
[3:04:36] <+Dova573> I really hope the sequel has dungeons
[3:04:36] <%SirGO0SE> but the Shrines are a new concept and make up for the lack of dungeons in a way
[3:04:36] <%Muffinmastr> i kinda thought of the shrines as dungeons but i guess theyre not
[3:04:37] <%Pulsewing> Durability in BOTW is fine in the early game but once you attain mastery of the system it does nothing to change itself to adapt to having too many weapons and nothing to do with the worse ones
[3:04:40] <%BinaryFireball> Tarry Town saved BOtW
[3:04:41] <+worldbrand> on repeat playthroughs i actually liked them more but i think people misremember how bad other traditional zelda dungeons are
[3:04:44] <%VoidBaronJules> the only thing i liked about botw was the exploration and characters
[3:04:45] <Mangahero18> Unpopular Opinion Time: BoTW is the worst Zelda game not counting those CDi games.
[3:04:45] <Onatamana> I hope with BOTW 2 they can use their development time to flesh out the base game more.
[3:04:49] <%barkon345> yea and the final battle with ganon is piss easy
[3:04:49] <goblinpuppy> Did anyone else think the divine beasts were going to be a Shadow of the Colossus boss fight? I was so sad when it wasn't
[3:04:51] <+twohitgood> the whole dungeon aspect of BOTW (whether shrines or the beasts) are very disposable and forgetable on their own.
[3:04:52] <%TIME_PUNCHER> Link is just inferior Banjo-Kazooie when you think about it
[3:04:54] <Profmcstevie> The thing everybody wants to "steal" from BOTW is it's world and exploration. Not much else
[3:04:56] <%SaiyanShoto> The open world is also very empty and has no music
[3:04:56] <pokefan9956> a lot of the faults of breath of the wild I feel go away when you stop treating it like a traditional zelda game
[3:04:56] <TallGuyWithAHoodie> Weapons breaking means most gamers will use their weakest weapon 90% of the time to "save" the good weapons for later.
[3:04:56] <+Kappaknight201> BotW was just a mediocre game
[3:04:56] <%Broand> Hows the PC port of okami anyway?
[3:04:58] <%FlamingoJazz> no
[3:04:59] <Supabait> if BotW wasn't a zelda game it would be considered wholeheartedly mediocre
[3:04:59] <%VoidBaronJules> and sadly it wasn't enough to carry the game
[3:04:59] <%Ragnvaldr_AGH> I really like BOTW. I agree with your statements.
[3:05:03] <%Emperor_Machinus> Shielded face hamsters!
[3:05:03] <%king_wragles> I'd rather not look at Skyward Sword again
[3:05:04] <%averyoddjew> BOTW isn't a zelda game. it's a skyrim but good
[3:05:05] <+Novembermagnus> I hate that Skyward Sword had some of the best bosses in the series.
[3:05:05] <%BoxNavy> i hate that botw doesnt have items like the hookshot and shit
[3:05:05] <%Aydarkzero> i'm so glad all the bosses were just Ganon but in a different color just like in wrath of cortex
[3:05:05] <%AncelDeLambert> Skyward had ONE good dungeon
[3:05:05] <Explodincatz> quality made dungeons
[3:05:07] <s1rcuit> @NenaFan101 one of the many reasons why I hate prequels
[3:05:09] <%FacetiousAF> do i really need to look at skyward sword?
[3:05:10] <alex_xander_b> i'm debating wether or not to finish botw because I know the ending sucks
[3:05:11] <Mangahero18> I LOVE Skyward Sword.
[3:05:12] <Make_me_mad> Skyward Sword is RADICAL and I will never stop loving it.
[3:05:12] <+thebeargoesHONK> i'd rather not look at Skyward Sword
[3:05:17] <%RealThiele> fucking backtracking
[3:05:21] <Blank9> skyward sword has some of the best music in the series, and 2 of the best dungeons (sandship and cistern)
[3:05:24] <+worldbrand> i have very few nice things to say about SS
[3:05:25] <Sowlith> i love the story in skyward sword and the gameplay hurts me lol
[3:05:28] <%ShinobiPhoenix> I spent way too much time playing BOTW. like I was possessed
[3:05:28] <%BigCoffee> Skyward sword but with twilight princess's gameplay might be one of the best ones available
[3:05:29] <valriot> I mean i think Majoras Mask is a FUCKING TERRIBLE GAME, especially a Zelda game, but its interesting and unique in its own way
[3:05:32] <goblinpuppy> I really did not enjoy the sword gimick
[3:05:32] <+TheNewZealandStory> skyward sword is a fucking putrid game
[3:05:33] <%Rozalyndis> skyward sword is a better *zelda game* but absolute fuckin shit video game
[3:05:37] <pokefan9956> yeah. I like good dungeons and I loved the story in skyward sword. I understand the hate for it, but I love it
[3:05:37] <heuristicfailure> BOTW is like Death Stranding. The fun part is figuring out how to get from point A to B, but everything else is meh.
[3:05:37] <%BoxNavy> i wanna give skyward sword another chance if it comes to switch
[3:05:41] <%king_wragles> If we could just get Skyward Sword out of WiiU jail, I'm sure they'd change a few things to actually LET YOU PLAY THE GAME
[3:05:42] <%cvp5127> what story
[3:05:46] <ExpressNode> So it's like Morgana in vanilla P5 telling you to go to bed
[3:05:51] <%ShinobiPhoenix> I have 30 hours in Fenyx Rising already
[3:05:51] <%goose_attack_almanac> I had a shitty Wii with bad tracking on the remotes so I couldn't even play Skyward Sword
[3:05:57] <Profmcstevie> Dowsing, fighting the imprisoned, the sky being dry and empty, the combat being too much of a focus and also being fucking busted, etc. etc.
[3:05:57] <%ShinobiPhoenix> after doing my fixes
[3:05:58] <ShichiNoBushi> There's a lot of overlap of gameplay with Zelda and Metroid games.
[3:05:58] <%SaiyanShoto> I wanted a Wii for skyward sword but never got one. I guess I dodged a bullet
[3:06:01] <Supabait> oh its nothing
[3:06:03] <Supabait> 90% of the time
[3:06:04] <NitronStreams> I like SS and BOTW
[3:06:05] <Broken_Sonex> BOTW's Master Sword sucks ass. Isn't; the Master Sword supposed to be the best in these games?
[3:06:05] <%wibbwobbler> wow priorities i guess
[3:06:08] <CursedNobleman> BOTW... i dont think i love it. it does exploration well, but the rest is kinda... just there
[3:06:08] <dinnydanny777> I think I enjoyed Twilight Princess more than BOTW tbh
[3:06:09] <BlueLunecy> Now they gotta find a balance between the two
[3:06:11] <%Rozalyndis> it's why you jive with sandbox games so much
[3:06:14] <%Houndemise> There‚Äôs a lot of fetch quests and repeat bosses in skyward sword too
[3:06:19] <pokefan9956> the boss battles in skyward sword are also fuckin sick
[3:06:20] <TallGuyWithAHoodie> I wish BotW was less like itself and more like a generic action RPG
[3:06:20] <Blank9> seriously, skyward sword's OST is ridiculous
[3:06:24] <ner0romanov> BotW is also beautiful by most people standards. that helped alot.
[3:06:24] <%the_krypto_knight> Zelda has changed so much over time that each game will disappoint some portion of the fanbase
[3:06:24] <%VoidBaronJules> personally i hope they expand the dungeons and bosses for BOTW2
[3:06:25] <+twohitgood> the exploration is great in BotW but the combat and durability really ruin the game for me.
[3:06:28] <%DakotaMacDoodle> Botw has the best wait whats that over there
[3:06:30] <%Pulsewing> @PatStaresAt have you played Swords of Ditto
[3:06:33] <%goose_attack_almanac> HE DROWNED
[3:06:33] <deeewooh> the series needed a revamp botw was just what the series needed
[3:06:35] <Kemmybelle> hopefully Botw 2 will be a good mix of those games.
[3:06:35] <+Novembermagnus> The 6 armed boss is maybe the single coolest boss in all of Zelda.
[3:06:39] <Kghaleon> BOTW spoiled me, so I can't appreciate Genshin or Immortals
[3:06:39] <%BinaryFireball> Death Stranding broke my heart when I ventured out and realized it's not an exploration game
[3:06:41] <Make_me_mad> I love breath of the wild but a LOT of that game is just straight-up shitty.
[3:06:43] <TheLegendofNate> Yeah that's my feelings on botw
[3:06:44] <Pyon84> Shadow of the Colossus?
[3:06:44] <%barkon345> you got to be like what that over there? oh is another rock or some ruins of a building that probably was cool at one point
[3:06:45] <%king_wragles> Have you gone back to NMS?
[3:06:46] <neekocheeko> playing stalker for the first time, im just running around exploring and getting scared
[3:06:46] <CursedNobleman> getting the super gattling in NV is awesome!
[3:06:47] <Sowlith> ghirahim also rules as a villian
[3:06:49] <%BinaryFireball> but DS is still a great game
[3:06:49] <gregpivo> I remember playing Skyward Sword for like an hour, hating it, and being like "Thankfully Uncharted 3 and Skyrim just came out too"
[3:06:50] <+sixcubit> why do the tecties have fat blowjob lips
[3:06:54] <%BoxNavy> crest that hill
[3:06:55] <pokefan9956> demise was one of the coolest fighrs
[3:06:55] <nivlac_555> I can't wait for the BotW sequel.
[3:06:57] <%Tearonex> new vegas is my go to comfort game
[3:06:58] <pokefan9956> *fights
[3:06:58] <ManfredA> tbf NV might have one of the densest maps of that era of RPGs
[3:06:59] <%ShinobiPhoenix> I can't say if Fenyx Rising has better boss fights, it has God of War like boss fights
[3:07:01] <%Zeikier> "everyone's sucking from my teat and it feels SO GOOD"
[3:07:04] <%Houndemise> Yeah, so do I
[3:07:06] <%Agami23> im dumb as shit and forget stuff easily, so i enjoygoing back to games and exploring again
[3:07:06] <ExpressNode> That's why I like a lot of Drpgs filling out my maps and finding hidden floors get my shit going
[3:07:06] <Supabait> its not infrastructure, its a strand-type game Kappa
[3:07:11] <%rumtumtugnutz> you know what was real disappointing, though, was LBW.
[3:07:13] <CursedNobleman> @sixcubit DansGame
[3:07:13] <TallGuyWithAHoodie> Unpopular opinion that Pat will hate: Fallout 3 is better than New Vegas.
[3:07:14] <%barkon345> breath of the wild let you explore a lot but the world felt barron
[3:07:18] <%SaiyanShoto> And BOTW shares the same director as Skyward Sword so that explains a lot
[3:07:18] <+Dova573> Like i want Botw2 to keep hey whats over there, just that when you get yourself over there you find yourself an entrance to a cool dungeon
[3:07:19] <OkoPoko> cheep cheeps
[3:07:24] <marvel877> I kept thinking my Wii Remote was busted because it kept desyncing playing Skyward Sword. Nope, common problem with the game. I like Skyward Sword, but IT HAD PROBLEMS.
[3:07:25] <M0untain_wolf> Cresting the Vegas hill with mods and new builds is always a good time
[3:07:26] <Onatamana> It's just like Zelda 2!
[3:07:26] <+Dova573> HELL NO
[3:07:27] <%barkon345> there was really nothing to find in it
[3:07:27] <Glassbrain> that is a really, really hot take
[3:07:28] <Broken_Sonex> BOTW's Master Sword made me hate that game.
[3:07:29] <ManfredA> that is unpopular
[3:07:30] <Glassbrain> that take is nuclear
[3:07:31] <%sonofthedeepsouth> wrong
[3:07:31] <ManfredA> cuz it's false
[3:07:31] <%rekinom> How does having flippers let you breathe underwater
[3:07:32] <+tetraes> arnt those the fish from mario lol?
[3:07:34] <%sonofthedeepsouth> WROOOOOONG
[3:07:35] <OkoPoko> Cap
[3:07:35] <%Mendin> That is OBJECTIVELY wrong
[3:07:36] <%Broand> Someone is incorrect
[3:07:36] <+Novembermagnus> Also controversial hot take incomin, Skyward Zelda best Zelda. And it's not even close.
[3:07:37] <%Tearonex> no it's not
[3:07:37] <+TheotherKristian> No
[3:07:37] <Grandma_Amari> Death Stranding was a cool game but the answers we get are all unsatisfying.
[3:07:38] <%BinaryFireball> I honestly feel like all open world games *should* be an exploration game because otherwise why have it be open world at all?
[3:07:38] <+bigrocksalt> that's not an opinion, it's just wrong
[3:07:38] <%Dakuu75> WHAT HAVE YOU DONE! ONE GUY
[3:07:38] <Make_me_mad> Fenyx Rising has better combat in general. It's not groundbreaking or very in depth, but Breath of the Wild has essentially nothing going on.
[3:07:38] <+SilverDevilfish> That's a solar heat take
[3:07:39] <%the_krypto_knight> When is the strand like Zelda game?
[3:07:40] <+Chewygamer> Thats just wrong
[3:07:40] <%Zundelle> I refuse
[3:07:41] <%Piemono> That's not a popular opinion at all
[3:07:42] <%AzureGale> Story teim with Pat
[3:07:42] <%QuipSan> Wrong
[3:07:42] <+Chewygamer> BOOOOOOO
[3:07:42] <Kghaleon> NV definitely had more factions to decide between
[3:07:42] <%VoidBaronJules> @Dova573 Yes
[3:07:43] <DuoScratch> Unpopular AND wrong.
[3:07:43] <%JusTTheGuyYouNeed> that is objectively wrong
[3:07:44] <+Dova573> I finish New vegas twice never got out of megaton city in 3
[3:07:44] <TallGuyWithAHoodie> I know I'm crazy.
[3:07:45] <%Muffinmastr> well you're right, that is an opinion
[3:07:46] <Broken_Sonex> @TallGuyWithAHoodie Fuck you
[3:07:47] <+Chewygamer> Booo that guy
[3:07:49] <%BoxNavy> monkaS
[3:07:49] <Zebens> LUL
[3:07:49] <NenaFan101> I mean... if you want to think that way, sure
[3:07:51] <notorious_rng> fo3 is literally terrible;le
[3:07:53] <%ShinobiPhoenix> and the dungeons in Fenyx Rising are NOT better because most puzzles in the game are move/carry block/ball from point a to point B
[3:07:54] <%LaughingCatt> You can have your opinion. But I think a lot of us will disagree
[3:07:54] <%SirGO0SE> LUL
[3:07:56] <alex_xander_b> hbomberguy made a whole video about this
[3:07:57] <lotusdagoat> its bad taste really
[3:07:57] <%sonofthedeepsouth> BOO THAT MAN
[3:07:57] <akitanito> "popular" opinion
[3:08:00] <%BinaryFireball> Fallout 3 is basically New Vegas....
[3:08:02] <CursedNobleman> F3 being better isnt the majority opinion. thats just kinda there. its fine to like it mind you
[3:08:02] <%Ne1son> Ban Him
[3:08:03] <%BoxNavy> :)
[3:08:04] <dinnydanny777> Fallout 3 is fine
[3:08:04] <NenaFan101> But Fallout 3 is popular for people who like to shoot things and not think
[3:08:04] <+Dova573> LIKE THATS WORST THAN ANY PAT TAKES
[3:08:04] <+Chewygamer> LUL that guy got the fucking fulls screen
[3:08:04] <%SaiyanShoto> Pat going in
[3:08:05] <TallGuyWithAHoodie> Oh wow I get the big Pat.
[3:08:06] <%Garthunox> You know what I love seeing in game? No matter how many times i see it in either location? Crystal Tower?
[3:08:06] <RajelSkoven> Just like Rare...
[3:08:06] <+SilverDevilfish> Nah man Big Rigs is only unpopular because of the haters Kappa
[3:08:08] <%sonofthedeepsouth> NEW VEGAS>>>>>>
[3:08:09] <@SSaryn> FO3 has its' moments and while I haven't played NV, ehhhhhhhhhhhhhhh
[3:08:09] <+Novembermagnus> PUT HIM ON BLAST< FUCCBOIVIN
[3:08:09] <M0untain_wolf> Yeah like Pats hate of RARE
[3:08:10] <%AzureGale> Or because Will Smith is in it
[3:08:10] <snivins> says the person often most wrong on this planet LUL
[3:08:10] <akitanito> room of 1 guy
[3:08:10] <+ElectricHoodie> I did like 3 better than New Vegas tho
[3:08:12] <%SirGO0SE> assblowing out in progress
[3:08:12] <%Piemono> Unpopular Opinion, getting stabbed is super fun
[3:08:15] <%Aydarkzero> oh damn
[3:08:15] <+Dova573> Well ok except over the dk music thing
[3:08:16] <%Garthunox> You're super wrong
[3:08:19] <%thebeargoesHONK> when i got Fallout 3, the disc was so fucked that i couldn't play it.... so first one was New Vegas..
[3:08:23] <Blank9> fuck the sewer/metro system
[3:08:24] <Grandma_Amari> I like Fallout 3 a lot for the map, but the stories are almost all worse. I missed random encounters in New Vegas though.
[3:08:25] <dinnydanny777> I hate Fallout 3's railroading of the main plot
[3:08:25] <%Ragnvaldr_AGH> I like both FO3 and New Vegas, and I like them both for different reasons. But NV is a genuinely better game to me.
[3:08:28] <%trueherobappo> Oh wait...is Pat still playing Zelda?
[3:08:28] <%AncelDeLambert> spelunking through the metro in FO3 was pretty great
[3:08:31] <librettodude> Bethesda is the progenitor of "Hey look at this cool thing over here"
[3:08:33] <+obeseninja12> Fallout 3 was my first one so it has a special place in my heart, but man is new vegas better
[3:08:35] <Broken_Sonex> Say "Fuck you." to this man and move on people
[3:08:35] <marvel877> Better than NV only because it doesn't crash AS MUCH. NV crashed on me SO much, but I enjoyed it more than 3.
[3:08:37] <%Rozalyndis> meanwhile i'm over here all "i don't like any of the fallout games. they're all boring. pass"
[3:08:40] <TallGuyWithAHoodie> (I do have to admit though, the New Vegas DLC is Stellar)
[3:08:44] <CursedNobleman> well, that was a concise argument.
[3:08:47] <pokefan9956> so fallout 3 is a bethesda game. got it
[3:08:48] <%rumtumtugnutz> Fallout 2 is the best Fallout game.
[3:08:49] <%sonofthedeepsouth> I'M GONNA PLAY NEW VEGAS AGAIN
[3:08:50] <NenaFan101> @dinnydanny777 Also... you can SKIP most of the game to do the plot.
[3:08:55] <dinnydanny777> In Fallout 3 the game streamlines you to the ending, like I explored and found Oasis I think but like none of it actually matters
[3:08:57] <%wibbwobbler> hmm
[3:08:59] <%ShinobiPhoenix> if they remaster New Vegas, I will buy that
[3:08:59] <Kghaleon> I appreciated the fog of war maps of Fallout 1 and 2 and just finding things.
[3:08:59] <%sonofthedeepsouth> TO SPITE PEOPLE
[3:09:01] <marvel877> Pat came ready for this discussion.
[3:09:03] <huskarl_zap> paddle barons?
[3:09:03] <robotman37> @Piemono No that's a great opinion that people refuse to accept
[3:09:05] <NenaFan101> @rumtumtugnutz Especially with Low Intelligence
[3:09:08] <%BoxNavy> ü§ì
[3:09:10] <rasamune> "At this point, everyone in the world has the same goal: turn on the purifier. Because of this overwhelming consensus, we were forced to fight a massive war."
[3:09:12] <s1rcuit> fuck the Legion
[3:09:14] <%BinaryFireball> Harold is the best
[3:09:15] <%the_krypto_knight> The only fallout I‚Äôve played is like 2 hours of 4 then I got bored
[3:09:16] <%Agami23> i dont get why anyone would like the legion
[3:09:16] <%sonofthedeepsouth> TRUE
[3:09:16] <%BinaryFireball> take that back
[3:09:17] <%SirGO0SE> @marvel877 born ready
[3:09:20] <%Dakuu75> call an ambulance
[3:09:21] <%ShinobiPhoenix> otherwise, I have only watched people play New Vegas, starting with Pat
[3:09:23] <%FacetiousAF> called tf out
[3:09:25] <ExpressNode> I don't think everyone should really jump on the guy it's just a different opinion
[3:09:26] <%rumtumtugnutz> @NenaFan101 Scorpin scorpin!
[3:09:26] <%GeneralSCPatton> We need a FO2 playthrough
[3:09:27] <%sonofthedeepsouth> F3 AND F4 WRITING IS SHIT
[3:09:28] <ape_hawk> the world feels alive and connect in new vegas, not so much in SO3
[3:09:28] <%LaughingCatt> The only bit I enjoyed was 'Murican Football Mecha
[3:09:29] <+jmcclellan18> Witcher 3 or Breath of the Wild in terms of exploration?
[3:09:30] <%FlamingoJazz> New vegas is 10 years old damn.
[3:09:30] <%SaiyanShoto> So I‚Äôm assuming New Vegas is one of Pats favorite games of all time?
[3:09:31] <%BinaryFireball> Harold is the best character ever
[3:09:33] <ape_hawk> FO3*
[3:09:34] <lotusdagoat> GECK is fucking lame
[3:09:34] <+Shoosler> is the New Vegas DLC worth getting??
[3:09:36] <KeiPrime> man i wanna play new vegas now
[3:09:36] <Dead_trickster> Fallout NV also isn't JUST green and grey
[3:09:38] <alex_xander_b> yes man is the only correct choice
[3:09:41] <Glassbrain> sir henry eden wants you to poison all the water in the wasteland because...????
[3:09:42] <%ClericOfSparda> @Rasamune Lol I hate how accurate that summary is
[3:09:46] <%SirGO0SE> @TallGuyWithAHoodie he's still breathing phew
[3:09:48] <Grandma_Amari> That 8 hour 'quick look' Morrowind retrospective mentioned urgency in story telling, and how it's important for pacing.
[3:09:49] <%Garthunox> Pat Hbomber guy echoes a lot of your statements! You should really watch his videos on FO3 and New Vegas!
[3:09:51] <%Daniel_Is_I> Witcher 3's open world actively detracts from the experience IMO
[3:09:51] <GeneralSCPatton> BOTW had abilities and verticality
[3:09:55] <+ianabstract> the final conflict of fallout 3 is two factions with advanced technology fighting over who gets to turn on a water filter
[3:09:55] <Kghaleon> BOTW is kinda empty though, unlike Witcher 3.
[3:09:55] <Glassbrain> he's secretly skynet?!?
[3:09:56] <TallGuyWithAHoodie> Counterpoint: That's cool. I also don't care about literally any plot element about New Vegas' main story. Whereas FO3 sucked me in instantly.
[3:09:56] <%thebeargoesHONK> Will we be seeing more Wasteland 3 game play?
[3:09:58] <+Wizardism> Both 3 and New Vegas suck
[3:09:59] <%Agami23> hey pat, whats your favorite faction in fallout? all games included
[3:09:59] <XelanArdel> I still remember when fallout 3 promised many ending depending on your actions. and that was a lie.
[3:10:01] <CursedNobleman> @Agami23 they didnt flesh out the legion due to time constraints
[3:10:02] <%twistedj3ster> W3's combat is TERRIBLE
[3:10:02] <TheLegendofNate> BOTW you literally can climb any mountain almost
[3:10:03] <KeiPrime> dead money is an acquired taste, but yeah the new vegas dlc is mostly worth it
[3:10:03] <%DakotaMacDoodle> Fallout 4's writing is very middle school
[3:10:08] <%BinaryFireball> Withcer 3 is an easter egg hunt of content
[3:10:10] <%Pappajimbo> music good though
[3:10:12] <ogfruitloops> Bethesda's better at making sandboxes, Obsidians better at making RPGs
[3:10:12] <%BoxNavy> no
[3:10:13] <pokefan9956> breath of the wild is NOT empty
[3:10:17] <Grandma_Amari> FO3's main story had way too much urgency, so it felt really weird to ignore it for too long. Same with FO4 honestly.
[3:10:18] <%BoxNavy> :)
[3:10:19] <valriot> "Minimap Syndrome" is SO FUCKING BAD, its the worst. BOTW was genuinely comfort on the eyes
[3:10:19] <Glassbrain> fallout 3 has tranquility lane and that is ALL i will give it
[3:10:19] <s1rcuit> The Legion's political, social, and military practices were modeled on a society that fell all by itself
[3:10:23] <lotusdagoat> hey pat you finished that tim rogers video?
[3:10:23] <M0untain_wolf> Boss key coffee
[3:10:26] <%DakotaMacDoodle> That and Witcher 3 fall damage is brutal
[3:10:26] <%AzureGale> Too bad Boss Key went out of business
[3:10:28] <%BoxNavy> well go get it :)
[3:10:28] <ManfredA> Dead Money is the best DLC once you realize it's the most tightly made
[3:10:30] <%ClericOfSparda> I like the fallout games, but man I hated 4's writing
[3:10:31] <%Tearonex> I will never get all those question marks in Skellige
[3:10:34] <+Dova573> Exploration in witcher3 is meh because moving geralt is not that fun
[3:10:34] <%SaiyanShoto> That‚Äôs why Tsushima is so good, you don‚Äôt need a mini map
[3:10:34] <%rumtumtugnutz> I bet its that chest you couldn't get to cause you needed flippers
[3:10:35] <%Agami23> @CursedNobleman yeah but i dont get why anyone would like them because they are scummy slavers
[3:10:36] <%ShinobiPhoenix> I will say, Pat will absolute HATE teh boss of this dungeon, everyone does
[3:10:37] <TallGuyWithAHoodie> Dead Money is great once you accept the game turned into a Survival Horror for the duration of the DLC.
[3:10:37] <RajelSkoven> Remember kids, you can't drown with flippers on
[3:10:38] <dinnydanny777> BOTW has AWFUL sidequests though, like playing Majora's Mask not long before it was a stark difference
[3:10:44] <%LaughingCatt> thats ok doodGood
[3:10:47] <Profmcstevie> Chill games are for leaking your brain
[3:10:47] <NitronStreams> thats streaming for you
[3:10:48] <%SirGO0SE> 4 had all the pieces to be great
[3:10:48] <+trackles_64> Thats how twitch works tho
[3:10:52] <Grandma_Amari> NV was way better about it for the most part. The initial goal was "maybe go kill the guy who shot you, or whatever. Who cares."
[3:10:54] <Broken_Sonex> @TallGuyWithAHoodie Continue to be right in your own word and reject reality
[3:10:54] <+Novembermagnus> I think the most fun I ever had exploring in a video game was probably in Xenoblade Chronicles X. Loved that game.
[3:10:56] <Kghaleon> I wish more people knew how awesome Might and Magic VI is.
[3:11:01] <robotman37> YEyeye the boicast
[3:11:01] <Supabait> bethesda isnt good at making anything are you kidding? their community makes more stable content then they do
[3:11:02] <s1rcuit> @PatStaresAt chill game = free thinking space in your brain
[3:11:12] <%RD_nx> I tried to get into new vegas, never played fallout before and fell off after 3 hours, I really want to play it, but I can only handle old games if I have nostalgia for them
[3:11:14] <%sonofthedeepsouth> MUH SON
[3:11:14] <%logoth_> Stay frosty Major Kellog
[3:11:15] <%bhp_99> Playing F4 rn
[3:11:16] <%SirGO0SE> i really wish 4 had a new vegas equivalent man
[3:11:20] <%RealThiele> oh no corn flake
[3:11:21] <%octavian_wolf> maaaaaan FO4 is such trash
[3:11:21] <%sonofthedeepsouth> KELLOG BLUEBERRIS
[3:11:23] <s_snowball> i dont want a son or a wife
[3:11:24] <KeiPrime> frosty falkes
[3:11:25] <KeiPrime> flakes
[3:11:25] <gregpivo> Fallout 4 makes Fallout 3 worse in retrospect, because now we have 2 Bethesda Fallouts where the plot is "My family member is missing and I need to save the world to find him"
[3:11:26] <%BinaryFireball> fuck those corn flakes
[3:11:27] <%ShinobiPhoenix> I feel I would love Anthem's exploration in another game
[3:11:30] <+Dova573> I hated benny more
[3:11:31] <dinnydanny777> Not the cornflakes man
[3:11:33] <%rumtumtugnutz> You can swim now Pat
[3:11:36] <lotusdagoat> holy SHIT i 100% forgot about kellog
[3:11:37] <+Novembermagnus> "Fuck that bitch." Yor wife?
[3:11:37] <librettodude> Kellogg's "Oops! All Hole!"
[3:11:41] <%ShinobiPhoenix> like Anthem with Xenoblade Chronicles X
[3:11:43] <ExpressNode> Tucan Sam shot my baby mama
[3:11:48] <+Dova573> but also beeny had the mystery of WHY YOU SHOOT BE BRUH
[3:11:48] <Clundy> Fallout but anthem mobility
[3:11:49] <dinnydanny777> I need to get his cornflakes
[3:12:02] <JimJaspers> Kellogg's demise was so underwhelming though.
[3:12:06] <%logoth_> "You like... some cornflakes??? bwahahahaaaa"
[3:12:07] <alex_xander_b> fallout 4 is good if you haven't played a fallout game before
[3:12:10] <%ShinobiPhoenix> Chronicles X world and creatures, but flying around in a mech
[3:12:11] <%Garthunox> Kellogs boobery
[3:12:15] <%DakotaMacDoodle> The fact you have to kill and cant talk the situation down really killed the game for me when it came out
[3:12:15] <akitanito> Kellogg was the peak of the game and it went downhill there
[3:12:23] <dinnydanny777> I feel like Fallout 4's plot ends the second Kellog dies
[3:12:24] <%sonofthedeepsouth> YUP
[3:12:24] <%RealThiele> ILL KILL YOU
[3:12:30] <huskarl_zap> four dialogue options always come up
[3:12:30] <%octavian_wolf> oh, that mod that reveals the actual options is SO FUCKING FUNNY
[3:12:33] <dinnydanny777> Or at least my interest in it did LUL
[3:12:34] <ManfredA> yes, yes but sarcastic, angry yes, yesn't
[3:12:35] <+obeseninja12> fun fact for fallout 4 if you have the full dialogue mod instead of wheel you will see how often 2 lines are literally the same
[3:12:35] <+TheNewZealandStory> fallout 4 absolutely hates the idea of letting the player define their character
[3:12:35] <%sonofthedeepsouth> ALL THE CHOICES LED THE SAME THING
[3:12:35] <+HiroTSK5> That seems like a macro problem, not a micro problem
[3:12:37] <Portal_Operater> yes, yes but maybe later, more info, sarcastic yes
[3:12:38] <%CzeekyPlays> Because plot
[3:12:38] <heuristicfailure> I'LL KILL YOU!
[3:12:41] <%CatastropheCorvid> What I find to be worse than that, is the dropped thread that Kellogg was in Nick's head.
[3:12:43] <%AncelDeLambert> GOD the plot in 4 is so BAD
[3:12:44] <SaltyAzteca> No closure
[3:12:45] <CursedNobleman> @Agami23 the argument can be made that lawful evil order is superior to anarchy, which is the argument raul would make. its harder to argue that against NCR or New Vegas, unless you really believe that technology and human weakness caused the great war, so instituting a meritocratic government focused on human strength is superior to the other two governments.
[3:12:46] <%Mendin> Why did you steal my son? GIMME THE MONEY
[3:12:46] <%BinaryFireball> did it not let you?
[3:12:48] <%machshop> todd howard is a a baby bitch

[3:13:03] <+deensterr> lel
[3:13:04] <+jmcclellan18> Confrontation with Benny in NV was so much better.
[3:13:08] <%DakotaMacDoodle> No questions only Yes or No
[3:13:08] <JimJaspers> Yeah. That sucked.
[3:13:09] <%wibbwobbler> that's pretty typical for a final confrontation in an rpg lol
[3:13:11] <Grandma_Amari> DONT ASK QUESTION, KILL MAN AND STEAL BRAIN CHIP.
[3:13:12] <CursedNobleman> thats not fallout-y
[3:13:19] <%Daniel_Is_I> Yes, No (Yes), Sarcastic (Yes), and Come back later
[3:13:21] <%BoxNavy> jermaPluto
[3:13:23] <s1rcuit> he keeps trying to let you leave
[3:13:24] <librettodude> When it comes to Fallout 4, The Railroad is more than just a faction; it's the way of life in the commonwealth
[3:13:26] <%Dakuu75> THERE'S NO TIME
[3:13:29] <ogfruitloops> Your character completely forgets they were refrozen
[3:13:29] <%AncelDeLambert> "I'm looking for my son" "Hello, I'm your son and I'm old enough to be your father. Your 'son' is decades dead." "Oh, okay, guess I'll go die somewhere in the wasteland"
[3:13:33] <+obeseninja12> Every fallout 4 character becomes the same which sucks
[3:13:33] <%BoxNavy> ILL KILL YOU
[3:13:33] <BlueLunecy> You can make more baby
[3:13:37] <%averyoddjew> i refused to finish fallout 4 because i hated every character

[3:13:40] <+worldbrand> what if one of us stole elmo
[3:13:40] <+Shoosler> GIMME BACK MY SON
[3:13:42] <ManfredA> Fallout has a history of letting you actually fucking talk
[3:13:43] <snivins> imagine the son is zangief
[3:13:43] <%sonofthedeepsouth> BUT ELMO IS SON
[3:13:45] <Drivershaft> what if kellog stole zangief tho

[3:13:48] <SaltyAzteca> PogChamp
[3:13:48] <%CzeekyPlays> Telling you that you need to care about your character's family just because is almost always a miss
[3:13:48] <librettodude> Alternate Start Mod
[3:13:49] <%FlamingoJazz> HE SHOOTS THE BABY INSTEAD
[3:13:49] <%Agami23> @CursedNobleman thats too big brain for me
[3:13:49] <%SirGO0SE> ma waif
[3:13:50] <+Novembermagnus> If somebody took Elmo...dear god...
[3:13:51] <Grandma_Amari> Fallout 4 would have been so much better if you were actually a synth
[3:13:52] <%LaughingCatt> Shoot baby, kidnap wife?
[3:13:52] <%BinaryFireball> let the new vegas team make it?
[3:13:52] <%BoxNavy> monkaS

[3:14:12] <+ahdurian> so John Wick'ing it?
[3:14:12] <+Chewygamer> SHAUN WHERE ARE YOU
[3:14:12] <Portal_Operater> Indeed.

[3:14:14] <%sonofthedeepsouth> WHERE IS MY DOG
[3:14:14] <%SirGO0SE> oh fuck
[3:14:15] <AncelDeLambert> I'm... I'm not scouring the wasteland for a dog
[3:14:15] <jetboots> John Wick?
[3:14:15] <alex_xander_b> but dogmeat exists
[3:14:15] <+Chewygamer> SHAUN
[3:14:16] <$Afterman_> id kill for my cat
[3:14:16] <+StromkoPenguin> Mr Woofers, head of the Institute
[3:14:17] <s1rcuit> GIVE THIS MAN PHD IN GAMEROLOGY
[3:14:17] <NeonBleu> You'd kill someone over Zangief?
[3:14:17] <%wibbwobbler> I'LL KILL YOU
[3:14:17] <greatspaceadventure> i prefer geckos, but take your pick
[3:14:18] <%rumtumtugnutz> Or a giant bag of drugs
[3:14:19] <ExpressNode> Wickout
[3:14:20] <JimJaspers> Yeah, someone call Fraud Howard.
[3:14:21] <%crowsloft77> Make it into John Wik?
[3:14:21] <NitronStreams> NO SHUT UP
[3:14:21] <+twohitgood> fallout 4: john wick
[3:14:22] <Grandma_Amari> FUCK MY SPOUSE YOU SHOT MY PET I'LL KILL YOU
[3:14:22] <Onatamana> That makes the twist INCREDIBLE
[3:14:22] <stevenellis386> HOLY SHIT PAT YOUR A GENIUS
[3:14:23] <%SaiyanShoto> But don‚Äôt you meet your adult son?
[3:14:23] <heuristicfailure> No. It's fine...
[3:14:23] <%cvp5127> bethesda hire this man
[3:14:24] <+Dova573> or MAKE IT BETTER
[3:14:25] <%BoxNavy> EVERYONE hates their son
[3:14:26] <%DakotaMacDoodle> Fallout 4 is the inverse of 3 with even less options
[3:14:27] <jellssssss20> Or your wife? You‚Äôre just getting cucked?
[3:14:28] <ogfruitloops> They need to make a mod that replaces the entire game with New Vegas
[3:14:28] <%Agami23> no it could still work.
[3:14:29] <gregpivo> It would IMPROVE that plot twist
[3:14:29] <+Genericho> no its just a dog instead.
[3:14:30] <%sonofthedeepsouth> THE TWIST SUCKED
[3:14:30] <%LaughingCatt> Keep the twist, evil Dog/Cat
[3:14:32] <%walternatorz> Yeah, that plot twist is pretty lame.
[3:14:33] <pokefan9956> nah, that plot twist could still work
[3:14:33] <Drivershaft> Fallout 4: Puppy Edition
[3:14:34] <%goose_attack_almanac> Yo I killed that child right away
[3:14:35] <Kghaleon> actually the twist was awesome because nobody expected it
[3:14:36] <akitanito> no no, but imagine if Father was just an old dog
[3:14:36] <s1rcuit> that's kinda the plot to Doom
[3:14:36] <%SirGO0SE> gigantic brain pat
[3:14:37] <NitronStreams> THAT MAKES IT BETTER
[3:14:37] <NenaFan101> The plot twist was that Darth Vader was Luke Skywalker's father
[3:14:39] <ape_hawk> pat, you gonna be going back to wasteland 3? at least off-stream?
[3:14:39] <%Agami23> put the dog or cats brain in a robo-human body
[3:14:40] <%Bree_Bear> i agree, much more relatable.
[3:14:40] <Blank9> Dogmeat how could you do this
[3:14:40] <Grandma_Amari> NO IT WOULDN'T. Just have the dog in a lab coat.
[3:14:40] <%AncelDeLambert> yeah, just tell people the twist, it's like a Shyamalan film, it's below respect
[3:14:41] <+TheNewZealandStory> bethesda amazes me in their inability to bring even two plot points together without it just completely going to shit
[3:14:41] <rasamune> YOU STOLE MY [text to speech] puppy [/text to speech] I'LL KILL YOU
[3:14:43] <%VoidBaronJules> but then you can have the brain jar doggo plot twist
[3:14:44] <OldManDeckardCain> WE ARE GOING DOWN THE ROAD OF EXTINCTION AREN'T WE lul
[3:14:45] <%linSP> make it a talking dog
[3:14:47] <greatspaceadventure> so basically rewrite the entire game to exclude the plot twist and be about reptilians instead? yeah sounds about right
[3:14:49] <%walternatorz> But totally cooler if that same twist is applied to a Puppy.
[3:14:55] <%SirGO0SE> plot twist arguably better
[3:14:56] <%bhp_99> I straight up iced the bad dude the second I saw him bc I didn't care
[3:14:57] <Broken_Sonex> YOU TOOK MY DOGMEAT. I'LL KILL YOU
[3:14:57] <%TheCrispyBoi> make dog talk
[3:14:57] <%rumtumtugnutz> that wasn't a good plot twist, thou
[3:14:59] <CursedNobleman> @Agami23 im stretching here. legion is for redpill smoothbrains. Morality Chads go Idependent/NCR, Technology Chads to House
[3:15:05] <Skye_Logan> why not replace your son with your wife?
[3:15:05] <gregpivo> Fuck it, have Khajit in Fallout so some characters are randomly cat people
[3:15:08] <%AncelDeLambert> @PatStaresAt teleport back to the start of the dungeon, that's probably faster
[3:15:09] <Dead_trickster> Bullshit, the institute just needed to put the doggo or kitty into a mech suite, with a translater. Pull some bullshit like they experimented on a pre-wasteland pet to make it super smart.
[3:15:11] <%Bree_Bear> he stole dogmeat, end of story
[3:15:11] <dd44dostivei> Pat, any interest in touching A Tale of Two Wastelands?
[3:15:16] <Oxybe> wasn't there a puzzle room to the right of the boss you couldn't do because you were missing the flippers?
[3:15:21] <+Dova573> And new vegas already had a cyborg dog
[3:15:22] <+StromkoPenguin> The Institute and its long-term goals wouldn't make any less sense if they were led by a non-talking dog.
[3:15:28] <SaltyAzteca> secret stairs?
[3:15:30] <+Novembermagnus> The twist is that your puppy grew up to be the dog from the Silent Hill Dog Endings.
[3:15:30] <dinnydanny777> Have some lore about the Institute making cat people problem solved
[3:15:31] <+BomaZero> It would have to be a cat since you have a dog ingame, then you can have pet wars at the end
[3:15:31] <librettodude> Bethesda RPGs are TERRIFIED of letting your character have a past, but REALLY HARD for giving them a destiny
[3:15:31] <alex_xander_b> nah fuck the ncr, yes man only
[3:15:32] <%Agami23> @CursedNobleman yeah see thats simple enough for my tiny brain to get
[3:15:37] <%sonofthedeepsouth> @CursedNobleman WRONG. CHADS only go independent
[3:15:38] <Broken_Sonex> @CursedNobleman Shut up. That's what they do?
[3:15:40] <RajelSkoven> Elmo as the head of the Institution...
[3:15:44] <%Rozalyndis> oh are we pattyHelping ?
[3:15:45] <Kghaleon> Best part of F4 was figuring out who the Institute were
[3:15:46] <%sonofthedeepsouth> BURN THE LEGION AND NCR TO THE GROUND
[3:15:47] <+kknutson4> Pat, do you prefer the 2D or 3D Zeldas? What's your favorite of each type?
[3:15:47] <%DakotaMacDoodle> I also hate how Bethesda treats Suoer mutants
[3:15:50] <Glassbrain> they are absolutely not terrified.
[3:15:56] <s1rcuit> @StromkoPenguin that'd be really funny though
[3:15:57] <Glassbrain> ELDER SCROLLS games avoid giving you a past
[3:15:58] <DublinRage> does the puppy also change depending on your char creation&s.o.?
[3:16:01] <%sonofthedeepsouth> SMASH NCR TROOPS WITH A BASEBALL BAT
[3:16:02] <%rekinom> ***
[3:16:05] <NitronStreams> AYYYY
[3:16:07] <%thebeargoesHONK> thebeargoesHONK subscribed at Tier 1. They've subscribed for 25 months, currently on a 25 month streak! Hey Pat. Will you be continuing Wasteland 3, on stream?
[3:16:13] <Glassbrain> FALLOUT games have a fucking hard-on for explaining your backstory in intricate details
[3:16:16] <%VoidBaronJules> fallout 5 should be john wick with the subplot being Cats vs Dogs
[3:16:23] <%BinaryFireball> man I hope the new oblivion game is good
[3:16:23] <ManfredA> @DakotaMacDoodle it's just funny dumb big guys
[3:16:25] <SaltyAzteca> hah, dry, wasteland. Ha
[3:16:29] <%BigCoffee> What does dry mean? Bad game?
[3:16:30] <ManfredA> it's awful
[3:16:32] <%Broand> What if they took your doggie and then used its DNA to make more doggie so people can have more doggie in wasteland
[3:16:33] <librettodude> "Family Relationship" is the most non-backstory ever
[3:16:34] <CursedNobleman> @Broken_Sonex its more complicated than that, but theres a waifu you create that has very interesting story implications
[3:16:37] <%AncelDeLambert> OH NOOOOOO rock guy is saaaaad!
[3:16:38] <%goose_attack_almanac> The block got real sad
[3:16:41] <%thebeargoesHONK> do you enjoy the game though?
[3:16:43] <$Afterman_> goddamnit pat you need to try pathfinder kingmaker
[3:16:43] <%AncelDeLambert> You tricked rock guy!
[3:16:47] <%rumtumtugnutz> Dry means dull
[3:16:47] <ManfredA> @BigCoffee dry here means boring as shit to watch
[3:16:48] <%Monkeyweed21> What about Bugsnax? @PatStaresAt
[3:16:51] <Blank9> Think you'll still do Shining Force 2?
[3:16:57] <%Agami23> they should make a new zelda 2 style game
[3:17:00] <Clundy> Whatever happened to tha5 game Biomutant that Ninja Theory was making? Anyone know if it was cancelled?
[3:17:03] <CursedNobleman> what is F3s core conceit?
[3:17:05] <s1rcuit> it's what?
[3:17:07] <XelGel> its the writing
[3:17:07] <%AncelDeLambert> you don't like "water good"?
[3:17:08] <%Broand> We don't talk about bugsnax
[3:17:08] <%SirGO0SE> truly need Cass scraping cheese off the floor
[3:17:08] <BTR_NOODLE> it's the same as Fallout 4 but reversed
[3:17:09] <CursedNobleman> kay
[3:17:09] <%machshop> hey Fawkes get in the radioactive room
[3:17:10] <%BigCoffee> @ManfredA Alright so could be fun to play but not watch
[3:17:11] <Glassbrain> "find your dad"
[3:17:12] <%SaiyanShoto> I love just hearing Pat talk about shit
[3:17:12] <%sonofthedeepsouth> MUH DAD. MUH SON
[3:17:12] <%BinaryFireball> I forgot the core story of fallout3 besides find dad
[3:17:14] <s1rcuit> oh yeah
[3:17:15] <%Mitalis> Mitalis subscribed at Tier 1. They've subscribed for 24 months, currently on a 24 month streak! 2 years, yay!
[3:17:16] <Broken_Sonex> @CursedNobleman Fuck it. I'll look it up.
[3:17:17] <cosmicdischarge> just ignore f4 main story and do the side
[3:17:19] <%greasypete00> find your dad, ok good job, find your son
[3:17:20] <%rumtumtugnutz> They should remake Zelda 2
[3:17:21] <Glassbrain> "i hate you dad" some people
[3:17:21] <%wibbwobbler> Liam Neeson
[3:17:22] <%VoidBaronJules> i don't have a dad, can't relate
[3:17:23] <heuristicfailure> But you gotta go find you [relative]...
[3:17:23] <%twistedj3ster> BIG TRUE
[3:17:24] <ManfredA> I love that NV had the balls to just make you a guy who exists
[3:17:24] <%Rozalyndis> mood
[3:17:27] <%BoxNavy> but find him tho
[3:17:28] <greatspaceadventure> the only thing that's surprising to me is how long it has taken the internet to reach the general consensus that NV is the best of the 3D FOs. and this coming from someone who never played the originals
[3:17:29] <%Mitalis> I wouldn't mind seeing you complete your playthrough of FF7 for the switch.
[3:17:29] <+jmcclellan18> Why was Outer Worlds so disappointing compared to New Vegas?
[3:17:33] <Ookamiden02> yup
[3:17:33] <%BinaryFireball> CSI bug dad
[3:17:36] <Oxybe> What if they took your doggo/catto in Fallout 4 because they wanted to make pure pets from their dna instead of weirdo creepy mutant ones
[3:17:39] <Kghaleon> I appreciated both games opening sequence, which was pretty awesome. Watching the world end or growing up in an isolated vault.
[3:17:43] <%RealThiele> liam "race war" neeson
[3:17:47] <CursedNobleman> @Broken_Sonex the waifu you design at the beginning is a mind flayer mental trick to corrupt you, its really good
[3:17:48] <dinnydanny777> Fallout 3 > Find your dad > commit suicide/let friend die to save the wastes > end
[3:17:48] <%sonofthedeepsouth> AVALLONE
[3:17:50] <%machshop> Outer Worlds doesn't have meaningful choices ever
[3:17:51] <%AncelDeLambert> the writing takes a nose dive after world 2
[3:17:52] <M0untain_wolf> Fallout 4: wasteland City Sim beta
[3:17:53] <%sonofthedeepsouth> SAVE US
[3:17:53] <%DakotaMacDoodle> Man, New Vegas raised the bar through the roof huh.
[3:17:55] <%Monkeyweed21> Will you ever revisit Bugsnax on stream?
[3:17:55] <+Wizardism> But Dad is Liam Neeson
[3:17:57] <s1rcuit> the story in Outer Worlds might as well not exist
[3:17:59] <+Chewygamer> The beggining of fallout 3 pisses me off so bad why do I have to be a fucking baby
[3:18:00] <%Garthunox> Fallout 3 and 4 are very family focused and it SUCKS!
[3:18:01] <+vaderxyz1970> Fallout 3 at least gave me my favorite bible quote and I ain't religious
[3:18:02] <%bhp_99> at least you can be a complete piece of shit in the story in F3 compared to F4
[3:18:03] <%king_wragles> They're both a bit unfinished, but in different areas
[3:18:05] <%TinyLittleDancer> Because NV is super overhyped as well
[3:18:07] <greatspaceadventure> what about Fallout 2077 Kappa
[3:18:07] <%AncelDeLambert> weapons are BORING in Worlds
[3:18:08] <+SilverDevilfish> Because it's Obisidian Mass Effect rather then polished NV
[3:18:09] <DublinRage> So... like a "Fallout" game then?
[3:18:10] <%Muffinmastr> yeah, in fallout 3 the main character shouldve been liam neeson looking for a "black bastard"
[3:18:12] <%Zundelle> I also feel as though people hyped up Outer Worlds so much to spite bethesda at the time
[3:18:16] <+popcorntacomon> I just didn't like the ending of Outer Worlds
[3:18:18] <XelGel> I accidently found my dad in fallout 3 in the 1st 3 hours of a blind playthrough when the game came out.
[3:18:20] <+Chester_goes_Berserk> I got hopes for outer worlds 2
[3:18:22] <OldManDeckardCain> AN OBSIDIAN GAME NOT FEELING FINISHED LUL
[3:18:28] <Broken_Sonex> @CursedNobleman Oh, well that's cool.
[3:18:32] <Glassbrain> pat try dropping into the pit
[3:18:35] <%trueherobappo> I just bought FF14 but idk what to do..
[3:18:41] <CursedNobleman> but the chairman is voiced by crispin freeman. that skit is so fun LUL
[3:18:45] <+jjjkopf> they should've just leaned into corporate hell and made everywhere like the first town/area
[3:18:46] <akitanito> It's a twist for the sake of a twist
[3:18:47] <alex_xander_b> outer wilds>outer worlds easy
[3:18:47] <%tinyswampthing> did anyone play the outer worlds dlc that cam eout
[3:18:49] <%AncelDeLambert> I mean, the plot twist was "everyone smart got delayed for fifty years, so the idiots were in charge and ruined everything"
[3:18:49] <Glassbrain> thanks

[3:18:58] <$Afterman_> @trueherobappo pick a class and race that looks cool go from there

[3:19:00] <%BoxNavy> :)
[3:19:00] <%Monkeyweed21> Did you ever play Far Harbor? the writing is WAY better than base fallout 4 @PatStaresAt
[3:19:09] <%cvp5127> god kill it
[3:19:09] <%AncelDeLambert> the plot of Outer Worlds is Idiocracy
[3:19:11] <%Dakuu75> oh... i'm not a fan of this
[3:19:12] <Glassbrain> i had no expectation of that working the way it did but there we go
[3:19:14] <ape_hawk> same
[3:19:15] <Saltmeisterr> GLUB GLUB
[3:19:16] <ShiningAxis> I can relate to this boss
[3:19:16] <dunkle321> Sick dialogue
[3:19:19] <%BoxNavy> bloop
[3:19:20] <DublinRage> I forget: were the "South Park" games from Obsidian?
[3:19:20] <%BinaryFireball> i dont remember this
[3:19:21] <+Novembermagnus> How does Fallout 1 and 2 stack up to NV?
[3:19:21] <%averyoddjew> yes
[3:19:21] <%AzureGale> Replace the P with a D
[3:19:23] <%Muffinmastr> fishyyy
[3:19:24] <stormhawk9891> BLOOP BLOOP
[3:19:25] <dinnydanny777> Is this Mario now
[3:19:26] <BlueLunecy> This is a Kirby boss
[3:19:27] <%Dakuu75> it's not even a "monster" his title is jsut "angler fish"
[3:19:31] <%DakotaMacDoodle> Outer Worlds starts strong but man you feel their budget run out
[3:19:32] <Zebens> this Angler boss is the easiest boss in the game really
[3:19:39] <+tetraes> i like that an angler fish is so ugly its a nightmare lol
[3:19:40] <%astuteabberation> @DublinRage stick of truth was iirc
[3:19:41] <%TinyLittleDancer> It's not that weird, its standard SciFi type
[3:19:43] <Explodincatz> this boss was a JOKE in the original
[3:19:46] <Lynxystem> i was IN LOVE with The Outer Worlds when i first played it, then after a bit i realized i was really just in love with the variability in the story, not so much the game as a whole. still one of the better actual roleplay games ive touched in a while at least
[3:19:49] <%AncelDeLambert> @Novembermagnus unplayable because they use D&D combat and D&D combat SUCKS ASS
[3:19:50] <%averyoddjew> in the original game, there was no knockback, so he just died faster
[3:19:54] <%Muffinmastr> this is a weird fight..
[3:19:55] <CursedNobleman> @Broken_Sonex yeah, the waifu/husbando shows up in your dreams and goes like, use more of your corrupting mind shit. that stuff is cool, and im hot
[3:19:56] <%BoxNavy> nah
[3:20:00] <%GeneralSCPatton> He was a basic bitch in the original
[3:20:11] <%BoxNavy> thats the fight

[3:20:22] <%king_wragles> Easiest fight in the game
[3:20:22] <%FuzzTime> BABY GAME

[3:20:23] <%Dakuu75> made for 6 year olds
[3:20:24] <%the22cstomp> easy baby game
[3:20:26] <Profmcstevie> Twas a gameboy game, bitchass bosses come standard
[3:20:27] <%ShinobiPhoenix> this boss was easier on GB
[3:20:28] <Glassbrain> fallout 2 is one of the best games of all time
[3:20:29] <CursedNobleman> and its a zelda game, theyre usually not too challenging
[3:20:32] <Glassbrain> i will die on that hill
[3:20:35] <%king_wragles> It was even easier on the GBA
[3:20:38] <stevenellis386> good job pat
[3:20:40] <heuristicfailure> Now do the same fight with half as much screen
[3:20:41] <%Mitalis> I'd love to see you finish your FF7 playthrough on the Switch
[3:20:42] <%goose_attack_almanac> Your characters entire personality is linked to people you've known for 10 minutes. Most of which is the sequence of you running to the Vault from the Nuke. And your family runs at half your speed so you leave them in the dust.
[3:20:47] <%Rozalyndis> here comes the padding... rozalyEmo
[3:20:52] <M0untain_wolf> harrps
[3:20:53] <CursedNobleman> fallout 2 is held back by the aged engine

[3:20:53] <rasamune> You found: a twangy-twang
[3:20:54] <%ShinobiPhoenix> again people, this game is from 1993

[3:21:00] <jfp4life> Look at that HAPISCORD
[3:21:02] <+StromkoPenguin> I tried to play through Fallout 2 again recently. Either I've played it too many times or it hasn't aged well, even with resolution mods.
[3:21:04] <%ShinobiPhoenix> we're very spoiled
[3:21:07] <%Monkeyweed21> Far Harbor is WAY better than FAllout 4 btw

[3:29:02] <%ClericOfSparda> Forgotten Realms: The Archives - Collection One on GOG
[3:29:02] <dinnydanny777> I liked Ghost House

[3:29:47] <Grandma_Amari> Let the pupper have this you're having them chopped off eventually.
[3:29:48] <%CapnClassix> @PatStaresAt All-Seeing Eye
[3:29:48] <%ephie_aka_pulpy> psaHoldon psaDogchamp
[3:29:48] <%AncelDeLambert> auto-map?
[3:29:49] <dinnydanny777> If we're just talking about games that are old, ECCO the Dolphin was neat
[3:29:51] <%AncelDeLambert> I am so lost
[3:29:52] <%vaporousTippler> Automap was totally a thing.
[3:29:54] <%king_wragles> GOG changes stuff all the time in old game
[3:29:55] <+Big_Bang_Blitz_> what about Legend of Grimrock though
[3:29:56] <%BoxNavy> otto
[3:30:02] <rasamune> Those old D&D games seem cool but the art style puts me off so bad. If it looked more like that PS2 Wizardry game I'd be all in I think
[3:30:03] <%CapnClassix> @PatStaresAt It runs with DOSBox and has automap in a seperate window or somethin
[3:30:03] <%king_wragles> Shame they won't publish anything from TAIWAN
[3:30:06] <+Novembermagnus> ekum bokum
[3:30:08] <huskarl_zap> truly a king
[3:30:08] <%Rozalyndis> it was dinnydanny777 but the final level can fuck itself
[3:30:11] <+Big_Bang_Blitz_> 2 I mean
[3:30:12] <%BinaryFireball> Grimrock is meh
[3:30:17] <%UmoLoco> ekum bokum
[3:30:17] <%AnimeAnimal93> I understand pat my dog does it too psaDogchamp
[3:30:21] <Kghaleon> Grimrock 2 is an amazing game.
[3:30:21] <+SinisterBroccoli> I can imagine that
[3:30:24] <%vaporousTippler> These kids need some pixels. Boot that shit up.
[3:30:24] <%hermitsen> legend of grimrock 2 is a masterpiece
[3:30:25] <librettodude> @AncelDeLambert Automap is like in the doom games, with the map that fills out as you explore
[3:30:26] <%Aydarkzero> ?
[3:30:28] <%VoidBaronJules> yeah
[3:30:28] <%twistedj3ster> SiN is worse
[3:30:37] <jellssssss20> Grim rock type games are really fun
[3:30:41] <dinnydanny777> @rozalyndis Yeah, it was pretty hard and I also found it kind of creepy as well LUL
[3:30:42] <ape_hawk> pathfinder: kingmaker?
[3:30:44] <Grandma_Amari> Your TV is a big monitor technically
[3:30:45] <%TinyLittleDancer> Worked fine on my laptop
[3:30:48] <@commanderclaw> You should @ the devs
[3:30:54] <%BigCoffee> Pat you play on a freaking TV instead of in a chair at a computer monitor. You're the only one to blame there
[3:30:58] <%Rozalyndis> well it was meant to be lovecraftian
[3:30:59] <%Dakuu75> "worked for me"
[3:31:02] <%FuzzTime> WORKS FOR ME LOL
[3:31:02] <ape_hawk> WORKS FINE FOR ME!
[3:31:03] <pokefan9956> "works fine for me"
[3:31:08] <%BoxNavy> works for me :)
[3:31:08] <+Big_Bang_Blitz_> It didnt seem to be a trouble

[3:31:32] <%Broand> What about the Avernum + Geneforge series
[3:31:37] <+Novembermagnus> WIELD YOUR BIG DICK STREAMER INFLUENCE AND @ THEM
[3:31:39] <Zayasu> @RealThiele LUL
[3:31:50] <Elky3> I feel like this is more "Just chatting" than the videogame but I also like Pat solo podcast.
[3:31:52] <%Rozalyndis> the word? i mean. i guess?
[3:31:54] <%FuzzTime> @AncelDeLambert I prefer cosmic or eldritch horror as descriptors
[3:31:56] <librettodude> Ok but Lovecraftian, or ""LoVeCrAfTiAn""
[3:31:56] <%Pyr0_Fr0st> "Works well on my ocular implants Pat"
[3:31:58] <+duckmeat_woohoo> So sad :(
[3:31:58] <%BoxNavy> @AncelDeLambert no. its so played out and no one does anyhting cool with it
[3:32:01] <%Glassbrain> psaDogchamp

[3:32:16] <%BoxNavy> this is so sad :(

[3:32:22] <%FuzzTime> BibleThump
[3:32:22] <dinnydanny777> What an appropriate line for a remake

[3:32:35] <%BoxNavy> SourPls
[3:32:36] <librettodude> Lovecraftian has become a checklist-genre, but there's a lot of neat depth to his works
[3:32:36] <Oxybe> "WORKS FINE FOR ME" ... remember Cyberpunk 2077?

[3:33:53] <%TinyLittleDancer> I get the sentiment, but plenty of people haveplayed Grimrock just fine on normal computers. The scaling isn't perfect but it is playable

[3:36:21] <%spitelite> now you have to beat it out of spite
[3:36:24] <NitronStreams> how many instrument does he have?
[3:36:30] <Broken_Sonex> HE KNOW
[3:36:31] <%rumtumtugnutz> This game starts strong and feels like a chore by the end.
[3:36:33] <%Axellogic> Even when you poop is known by all due to thine predictability
[3:36:34] <%BoxNavy> only 20 minoot
[3:36:35] <Mangahero18> I wonder if we could get Pat to try Code Vein...
[3:36:38] <Broken_Sonex> THE BOX KNOW ALL
[3:36:43] <dinnydanny777> Imagine not beating this baby game :)
[3:36:46] <%ShinobiPhoenix> it's more like it doesn't take SUPER long to get through them, side quests are what eat up most of the game
[3:36:52] <%king_wragles> @Mangahero18 he played in on release?
[3:36:54] <%Garthunox> you should do one more to spite him
[3:36:55] <%rumtumtugnutz> @Mangahero18 Pat streamed Code Vein
[3:36:58] <+Doctor_Stew> I mean some of these followers have 8 years of knowing you Pat
[3:37:03] <%TIME_PUNCHER> @rumtumtugnutz so a Zelda game? psaSmug
[3:37:04] <%Axellogic> he tried Code Vein im pretty sure @Mangahero18
[3:37:10] <Mangahero18> Ah really?
[3:37:19] <majindusto> "I'LL FINISH IT" DOESN'T FINISH IT lytPALM
[3:37:23] <Mangahero18> Dang. Sad I missed that.
[3:37:25] <%rumtumtugnutz> @TIME_PUNCHER Yeah, pretty much
[3:37:30] <%Axellogic> I think he thought it was okay but didnt seem into it
[3:37:37] <%Axellogic> been awhile
[3:37:40] <%Axellogic> it was at release
[3:37:48] <%Axellogic> should be on his youtube id think
[3:37:55] <%BoxNavy> i dont blame him for tapping out though
[3:38:39] <segychan> show dog
[3:38:51] <%SirGO0SE> yeah its been a fun stream but most things are
[3:39:11] <%Axellogic> heres a quote from code Vein stream "Best 7.3/10"
[3:39:19] <OkoPoko> Lowkey had a similar experience with ALttP
[3:39:22] <$RocketShot_> Is it over?
[3:39:30] <$RocketShot_> Oh nvm
[3:39:32] <%BoxNavy> yes
[3:39:35] <$RocketShot_> I see the brb
[3:39:42] <%Axellogic> yeah 2020 ended @RocketShot_
[3:39:44] <%Axellogic> :V
[3:39:48] <$RocketShot_> Am stinky
[3:39:54] <%GeneralSCPatton> Pat should play Oracle of Seasons instead
[3:39:59] <%BoxNavy> get a load of this guy
[3:40:01] <$RocketShot_> Dam really? Is that what they call that fancy new year?
[3:40:02] <%BoxNavy> he STINKS!
[3:40:23] <segychan> stinky bastard man
[3:40:25] <$RocketShot_> Lmao I just use stinky as an encompassing term for stupidity
[3:40:26] <%BoxNavy> @GeneralSCPatton nah i think he would feel the same way about the oracle games as he does this one
[3:40:27] <%FacetiousAF> but also SourPls
[3:40:50] <segychan> pat should read Mistborn
[3:40:51] <%Tman451> Tman451 subscribed with Prime. They've subscribed for 44 months! 
[3:40:52] <%FacetiousAF> maybe pat just isn't a zelda person
[3:41:18] <%ShinobiPhoenix> maybe not most classic Zelda
[3:41:36] <%ShinobiPhoenix> I mean Dark Souls is ALSO Zelda
[3:41:39] <%BoxNavy> he should play minish cap B)
[3:41:56] <%ShinobiPhoenix> he litearlly already talked about liking Minish Cap
[3:41:58] <$RocketShot_> Ew
[3:42:11] <$RocketShot_> Ewwww
[3:42:13] <%Monkeyweed21> BloodBorne is the Dark Souls of Zelda
[3:42:18] <segychan> minish cap was cool
[3:42:19] <%BoxNavy> yeah i mean like
[3:42:22] <%BoxNavy> stream it
[3:42:25] <%ShinobiPhoenix> I love Minish Cap and I'm mad it was only on 3DS through Ambassador
[3:42:26] <%BoxNavy> also he said he didnt beat it
[3:42:35] <$RocketShot_> Uh
[3:42:38] <%rumtumtugnutz> The Oracle games aren't really very good.
[3:42:44] <$RocketShot_> Minish cap was gba wasn‚Äôt it
[3:42:44] <%ShinobiPhoenix> I know it's on WiiU, but I certainly dont have that now
[3:42:48] <%BoxNavy> that ambassador shit was so weird
[3:42:49] <%rumtumtugnutz> They're not BAD
[3:42:53] <%SirGO0SE> yeah minish cap would be bitchin
[3:43:06] <%RD_nx> anyone think getting DMCV on steam is worth it right now? 20 bucks but no LDK
[3:43:07] <%rumtumtugnutz> But Minish Cap is the best handheld Zelda.
[3:43:09] <$RocketShot_> But what about
[3:43:09] <majindusto> Minish Cap was a GBA game tho...Not a 3DS game
[3:43:12] <%Monkeyweed21> Dark Souls is the Dark Souls of Zelda
[3:43:13] <$RocketShot_> Majora‚Äôs mask
[3:43:20] <%SirGO0SE> but i bet minish cap would end with Pat saying "i was wrong this game sucks"
[3:43:24] <%ShinobiPhoenix> Minish Cap was GBA, so if you want to play it now, fine a GBA, buy a WiiU or someone still have Ambassador for 3DS
[3:43:24] <$RocketShot_> Yes get dmcv
[3:43:29] <segychan> f
[3:43:29] <%Broand> Broand subscribed at Tier 1. They've subscribed for 10 months, currently on a 6 month streak! Yo pat, Have you any thoughts on La mulana and La mulana 2, the extremely complicated metroidvania?
[3:43:48] <Ultimatefool> @ShinobiPhoenix Or sail the high seas LUL
[3:43:54] <%ShinobiPhoenix> I thought about buying those, I watched Octopimp play the first one
[3:43:55] <mr_slaide> You know what the world needs? More skeletons.
[3:44:07] <%ShinobiPhoenix> I am of course talking LEGAL means
[3:44:09] <NitronStreams> dmcv "might" get lLDK and RTX dlc later but not confirmed
[3:44:11] <%FacetiousAF> skeletons are a food
[3:44:16] <%GeneralSCPatton> La Mulana is GREAT. I recommended it to him once, and warned that he would need to take notes and screenshots
[3:44:35] <%ShinobiPhoenix> I thought about La Mulana, but only on sale
[3:44:36] <%BoxNavy> :)
[3:44:42] <%king_wragles> Good news???
[3:44:44] <%ShinobiPhoenix> and they were on sale, but I opted out of it
[3:44:49] <CursedNobleman> but?
[3:44:51] <mr_slaide> Notes? Screenshots? What is that scientific mumbo jumbo bullshit? I should beat a game by masing 1 button!
[3:44:52] <wunderkindest> Eye of the Beholder 2 is real good
