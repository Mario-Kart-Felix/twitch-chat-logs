[0:46:25] <%TenguGemini> so you can actually change what the health items look like in the menu
[0:46:26] <%Ipsenscastle> I fully expect this character to do that dumb Colossus WHOOOOOOAAAAAAAAAAAA special move
[0:46:28] <elmustafa01> Tekken Chicken
[0:46:29] <+xpakeo> do big wombo like woolz
[0:46:30] <%griffball13> are the belmonts around
[0:46:31] <mMayrro> Streets of Turkey

[0:46:33] <CelestialCage> Hah one handed lifts
[0:46:33] <Melchior_the_Wise> it was on a plate
[0:46:33] <thetruenicster> Wait, does the food change depending on who you play as?
[0:46:34] <%sleepy_coffee> Why should he need a knife when his arms are the size of a truck?
[0:46:34] <dan_rekt> ask for Turkey and you shall receive
[0:46:35] <EatTheB0otyLikeGroceries> how it be
[0:46:39] <%Shadicara> Turkey of Rage
[0:46:39] <+omenzazu> the angriest turkey
[0:46:39] <zenorot> Kill Donovan. You must stop the meme rn
[0:46:40] <%1matheuw> remember children:alway vandalize
[0:46:41] <%ScreamLord> @PatStaresAt You gotta admire these street thugs balls to go after a man 3 times their size in muscle with giant robot arms
[0:46:41] <%Shonen_hero> man turkey's freshest when you scrape it off the road side
[0:46:42] <alphonseisbest> the lesser form of wall turkey
[0:46:49] <ShichiNoBushi> Almost as good as Wall Chicken.
[0:46:54] <%Ipsenscastle> I've not seen any bombs, did he lie about the bombs within his arms?
[0:46:57] <TrollKing96> Is street turkey better or worse than wall turkey?
[0:47:00] <%blaggablag> I love how he just shoots his enormous knuckle forward without any torso momentum
[0:47:01] <TigerClaws12> are there infinites in this game?
[0:47:05] <jyeowa> pat's gonna beat this then p5r or just get past a few levels?
[0:47:05] <shadepman> Floyd is like the most Woolie-core character
[0:47:06] <%GabeSweetMan> Wall Chicken's cousin Booth Turkey
[0:47:06] <Jack8274> 3 SILVER PIECES!!!!!!
[0:47:07] <%arran_throttle> Its just like DARK SOULS
[0:47:14] <%TalisKanju> There DEFINITELY is a dash in Streets of Rage 3
[0:47:14] <%Mobilebeardunit> Totally Not Jax
[0:47:18] <+fingalights> We needed a 90's Cartoon called"Wall Chicken and Street Turkey"
[0:47:22] <dan_rekt> RESPECT THE PIPE
[0:47:23] <%DappercatEsquire> lo-fi hip hop beats to beat people to death to
[0:47:25] <%Shonen_hero> It depends on the wall. Is the Wall Turkey in fiberglass?
[0:47:28] <%Estuko> @arran_throttle is thisthe Dark Souls of Streets of Rage games ??
[0:47:29] <%Manjove> The Dark Souls of Sidescrollers
[0:47:30] <CosmicApe13> I think the last Side Scroll Beat Em Up I Played was Castle Crashers
[0:47:32] <majima666> you could dash as skate in sor2 and everyone had a run in sor3
[0:47:33] <%JonesMcFly> I like this game, but it look clunky as fuck.
[0:47:36] <%blaggablag> the STEAMIEST CHKCIEN

[0:47:40] <$thesickestzak> Hit feels goodt
[0:47:42] <Man_in_the_Red> there really should be a leniancy for first hit, at most 2 steps up or down magnitized you to the nearest enemy

[0:47:53] <CelestialCage> I've seen gameplay footage of dashing unless it's character specific
[0:47:57] <EatTheB0otyLikeGroceries> the turkey is steaming from the dank streetness
[0:47:59] <%1matheuw> was that a parry?
[0:48:02] <%arran_throttle> @Estuko it might be.... Kappa

[1:19:15] <CelestialCage> It took me like 15 minutes to dodge this guy correctly
[1:19:17] <%tigerfang86> DAMN
[1:19:18] <Warbot40> Music's good though its a bit more low energy at points
[1:19:19] <%toolofparanoia> At least its not Big John
[1:19:20] <%Chichen> Big Ben just got CLOCKED
[1:19:22] <%Laecerelius> Punch that chonker!
[1:19:23] <%Taisuru> Nice slow throw
[1:19:25] <Amokraw> Big Baby grown up.
[1:19:29] <%GalacticaPhanto> this is definitely a Yuzo track
[1:19:34] <+omenzazu> music SLAPS
[1:19:35] <+gimmickypizza> Pipe man
[1:19:39] <DaBigVitus> how do those pants stay on
[1:19:39] <+jetjagger222> @Warbot40 its lacking the gen synth edge
[1:19:40] <%Valentinius_Anodyne> Apparently Hideki Naganuma was supposed to contribute to the music but he dropped out due to scheduling reasons
[1:19:41] <%tigerfang86> oh no a GUY WITH PIPE
[1:19:42] <AutechreTwinAphex> I guess for any other game the soundtrack would be great - just by SoR standards it's definitely the weakest part of the game by far
[1:19:43] <frogphil> give Haggar his pipe back
[1:19:46] <+TheOneCalledRock> this song is sounding like it's got those genesis sythns in it
[1:19:59] <frogphil> yea that's straight up hunting hawk
[1:19:59] <Man_in_the_Red> didnt the launch trailer show Yoko Shimumura in the OST

[1:20:10] <Warbot40> @jetjagger222 Still good. Just a different feel.
[1:20:14] <%moogleboy1984> @CelestialCage it's a good button
[1:20:17] <%logoth_> Aaaaaaaaaa
[1:20:17] <%GalacticaPhanto> Yuzo did just post a zip of all the work he did on this on Twitter
[1:20:18] <AutechreTwinAphex> @Man_in_the_Red that would be the Kingdom Hearts 3/FF15 composer - not the SoR1/2 composer
[1:20:21] <+jetjagger222> @Warbot40 agreed
[1:20:27] <%yoshkosh20> old boy sequence
[1:20:43] <+TheOneCalledRock> i miss naginuma music FeelsBadMan
[1:20:43] <%tigerfang86> HE KEEPS DOING IT
[1:20:44] <%Jbulleit97> Anyone else think Axel's death cry sounds like Snake?
[1:20:45] <DaBigVitus> thugs too cool to go full effort
[1:20:45] <%Taisuru> Block Kappa
[1:20:49] <%logoth_> I never played a streets of rage, but this seems to try its best to be as faithful as possible.
[1:20:50] <Man_in_the_Red> @autechretwinaphex i know, the trailer showed a LOT of guest conposers
[1:21:02] <%GalacticaPhanto> He used gen synth with his newer style
[1:21:11] <+jetjagger222> pat, wait till you meet the kung fu and muay thai guys
[1:21:17] <+Hellhander> i like that there's an "Orang Cassidy" thug
[1:21:20] <Jack8274> Kevin is the true Final Boss
[1:21:23] <Warbot40> @jetjagger222 better than all those times sega completely failed to replicate the genesis with Sonic 4 and Forces.
[1:21:24] <%yoshkosh20> that is a great walking animation, holy shit

[1:21:38] <%cvp5127> Kreygasm
[1:21:39] <AutechreTwinAphex> can't really recognize Shimomura at least in this particular track - perhaps another one

[1:21:47] <%TalisKanju> Look at their names

[1:21:48] <%tigerfang86> the power of CBT made them STRONGER pat
[1:21:49] <CelestialCage> Wait she was a generic enemy in the first game hmmm
[1:21:49] <%logoth_> When you have an erection nothing can stop you
[1:21:49] <suddenlyscorched> They even get new NAMES
[1:21:52] <baronvonbirman> That's one hell of a poster

[1:22:48] <%Jbulleit97> YEAH BLAZE!
[1:22:50] <+CryptusMaximus> BEST GIRL TIME
[1:22:51] <%vicar_anat> finally exactly what i came here for
[1:22:51] <%Pyroclase> I'm sorry, it's a cargo ship, not a barge.
[1:23:02] <CelestialCage> Excop #2
[1:23:02] <stevenellis386> I guess the kid with the roller skates couldn't make it
[1:23:08] <artoflec> adams not selectable at the beginning wtf elaB
[1:23:10] <%AngriestAngryArtist> Oh sick it's red Tifa!
[1:23:27] <%rynfz> T H I C C
[1:23:27] <CelestialCage> @AngriestAngryArtist Blaze came first
[1:23:31] <%GalacticaPhanto> Skate is in it as retro, I think?
[1:23:33] <+jetjagger222> @GalacticaPhanto nice. i saw adam plays a lot like his SORR version.
[1:23:35] <KeiPrime> you move so dang slow in this game tbh
[1:23:35] <Superscooter> she thicc
[1:23:36] <%j0ustar> that voice kind of doesn't fit her
[1:23:36] <+CatastropheCorvid> "Almost Woolie-bait"
[1:23:36] <$OmegaWeltall> She came YEARS before Tifa how dare you
[1:23:37] <+CryptusMaximus> @stevenellis386 He's unlockable actually
[1:23:42] <AutechreTwinAphex> I understand this is a budget game but instead of this art direction I would have loved to see something far higher budget like Devil May Cry 5-quality graphics and a far more realistic art style
[1:23:43] <%AngriestAngryArtist> @celes
[1:23:43] <%YakumoYomi> She proceeded Tifa, though.
[1:23:46] <Warbot40> tifa before tifa
[1:23:47] <stevenellis386> oh ok
[1:23:51] <+TheLastStar> wub wub wub wub wub wub
[1:23:53] <%Ancopro> that guy just blanka balled out
[1:23:54] <%AngriestAngryArtist> @celestialcage Still red Tifa.
[1:23:56] <Iam_Dead> TIFA ROJO PogChamp
[1:23:58] <%GalacticaPhanto> too realistic is bad
[1:23:58] <Man_in_the_Red> @yakumoyomi nonono, shhhh
[1:24:08] <Man_in_the_Red> the kids wont know that
[1:24:09] <%Pyroclase> I don't think photorealism is the best art direction for a beat-em-up, honestly
[1:24:09] <daisyyyy> i cant afford it but im gonna pick this up next week
[1:24:09] <%TalisKanju> Blaze would need short hair to become real Woolie-Bait
[1:24:21] <%GalacticaPhanto> this fits the style well. worked with Double Dragon Neon
[1:24:25] <%Dakuu75> !uptime
[1:24:25] <@Moobot> I've been playing this game for how long? Oh only 1h 24m.
[1:24:32] <%Fenrirlives> @autechretwinaphex what? heck no realism would be awful for this
[1:24:40] <AutechreTwinAphex> @Pyroclase well DMC5 and Yakuza feels like the modern scrolling beat 'em ups of this era - I would just like Streets of Rage to be a real contender to those
[1:24:41] <+jetjagger222> as far as mechanics go this looks the best brawler in a while
[1:24:47] <TheVampiricVamp> That suplex tho
[1:24:49] <alphonseisbest> now this looks like the start of a hentai I know
[1:24:53] <DKthundah> wow best soundtrack off top already
[1:24:57] <stevenellis386> think I might buy this game
[1:25:01] <analostrich> big ben still got his laugh. that's cute <3
[1:25:02] <CelestialCage> @AutechreTwinAphex Ehhh. I think that games like this need at least some form of 2D art style to still be the "beltscroller" the series is supposed to be
[1:25:03] <%Ascethetic> Dylon got fat
[1:25:03] <%moogleboy1984> I always imagined Blaze was Latina, so it's weird hearing her use what sounds like Japanese kiai
[1:25:07] <daisyyyy> lets make it realistic so youre winded after fighting the first three guys, then you get stabbed
[1:25:13] <%Estuko> Realistic art styles =/= visual improvement for game
[1:25:13] <Man_in_the_Red> @autechretwinaphex that game exists, its called street wise
[1:25:14] <%Pyroclase> These characters have a tremendous amount of personality in their walk cycles.
[1:25:19] <%PanicSwytch> Somersault
[1:25:25] <daisyyyy> oh that kind lol
[1:25:30] <Superscooter> yeah her plot is great so far
[1:25:36] <CelestialCage> @AutechreTwinAphex Also Sega owns this and Yakuza. They dont need ANOTHER 3D beat em up under their belt
[1:25:38] <PeteyMcPickle> This game is incredible. Played it through 3 times already today, and it massively exceeded my expectations. The juggle mechanics alone make it feel so god damn satisfying.
[1:25:38] <%1matheuw> just whack'em
[1:25:40] <%GalacticaPhanto> @man_in_the_red or Beat Down, or Fighting Force
[1:25:41] <+CryptusMaximus> The leather jacket on top of the dress is such a rad ass look. Best design update.
[1:25:41] <AutechreTwinAphex> @Man_in_the_Red well except that the game is terrible and a modern 3D Streets of Rage doesn't have to be terrible - Devil May Cry 5 goes for pseudo realism - a Streets of Rage could too
[1:25:41] <%코코꾸라> antiair
[1:25:49] <mandorlalmond> is this Xmen Apocalypse?
[1:26:03] <AutechreTwinAphex> @CelestialCage well whatever - I just find this to be a very budget/indie-like sequel that doesn't really show 22 years of technical progression - you could do this on a Dreamcast
[1:26:04] <%Ipsenscastle> I don't get the appeal of scrolling beat 'em ups in the modern day apart from nostalgia. When I used to play Streets on the Mega Drive, I was dreaming of the Devil May Crys etc that would one day exist
[1:26:04] <%PanicSwytch> German suplex
[1:26:06] <+Hellhander> god... her chest is like a dead-heat in a zeplin race
[1:26:10] <Warbot40> was Francis in the old games or is he new? He's definitly not in SoR2. Maybe 3?
[1:26:12] <+jetjagger222> @AutechreTwinAphex LOL
[1:26:17] <%Fenrirlives> blaze sounds pretty young for her appearance
[1:26:23] <%tigerfang86> they KEEP SPIN KICKING rooREE
[1:26:26] <Man_in_the_Red> @autechretwinaphex going full 3D would be a genre change and both are a part of long running series
[1:26:28] <+RidGaming> its the simp boss fight LUL
[1:26:29] <Th3rd3> I love that they counter jump attack
[1:26:31] <%SGrim> Francis and Kevin putting up one hell of a fight
[1:26:34] <+jetjagger222> the digital foundry vid on this is pretty good; goes into the making
[1:26:37] <thelonechris> CBT boss
[1:26:41] <analostrich> Kreygasm Kreygasm Kreygasm Kreygasm Kreygasm
[1:26:43] <Espio0> lmao, she jumped into it herself
[1:26:44] <Man_in_the_Red> Streets of Rage lives by it's sprites and music
[1:26:49] <%Dakuu75> oh gees, wall-bounces. nice
[1:26:49] <DKthundah> holy shit she Tiger Suplexes
[1:26:58] <AutechreTwinAphex> @Man_in_the_Red nah you could just make it 2.5D - it would still be rendered in 3D but it would just exist on a 2D plane
[1:27:14] <%tigerfang86> cool
[1:27:14] <TheVampiricVamp> YOOOO
[1:27:16] <%moogleboy1984> Shout Outs to that Gimp Mask in the upper left window
[1:27:16] <%Dakuu75> bad ass
[1:27:20] <%Zombrocom> Was not expecting that
[1:27:21] <stevenellis386> so blaze is a witch lol,
[1:27:23] <Wan6Saber> wow
[1:27:23] <DKthundah> fucking C H A K R A
[1:27:23] <CelestialCage> @AutechreTwinAphex I wasnt expecting much of a change unless they've been making consistent sequels for a while which they havent. I wouldnt mind if they did that for the next game tho as long as it wasnt a real sequel
[1:27:24] <Man_in_the_Red> @autechretwinaphex that sounds terrible
[1:27:27] <%GalacticaPhanto> considering this was a fan passion project, this is legit perfect. 3d would just make it Yakuza. just play Yakuza
[1:27:41] <Man_in_the_Red> The Takeover is what you want for SoR???
[1:27:44] <%Fenrirlives> @autechretwinaphex the spritwork here is the result of 22 years of progress. you can't get animation of this quality for cheap
[1:27:44] <CelestialCage> Like a spinoff
[1:27:49] <%GarbageNirvana> Honestly this looks rad
[1:27:52] <+jetjagger222> the takeover is barftastic
[1:27:54] <%Kirby_Sauce> Kirby_Sauce subscribed at Tier 1. They've subscribed for 15 months! guess who's back? back again? guess who's back? *not the super best friends*
[1:28:07] <PeteyMcPickle> After 20+ years, we didn't need change. We needed Streets of fucking Rage
[1:28:07] <DKthundah> FLYING PAN
[1:28:08] <%TalisKanju> Why is there a board of spikes on the wall anyway?
[1:28:11] <%Estuko> that's pretty much the Takeover at that point, unless you want a 3d environment beat um up, then Yakuza is for you lol
[1:28:12] <Wan6Saber> kek
[1:28:12] <mandorlalmond> Pog
[1:28:13] <+CryptusMaximus> So when will Team Yakuza just slap a grungy skin onto a Yakuza game and make a 3D Streets of Rage with all the mechanics of a Yakuza, but with Co-Op?
[1:28:14] <%moogleboy1984> should have broke the Pillory
[1:28:15] <%GabeSweetMan> Kirby why
[1:28:17] <%Chichen> yah its nice
[1:28:18] <+Hellhander> aparently... THIS Avatar began as a dick-bender
[1:28:21] <%Pyroclase> really good art style, too
[1:28:22] <%GalacticaPhanto> oh god yeah Takeover was weird looking
[1:28:22] <%Jbulleit97> PogChamp
[1:28:25] <%Estuko> @Kirby_Sauce FeelsBadMan eyy

[1:35:03] <%Dakuu75> @Amaterasu_Nyan yep
[1:35:06] <sling1995> Yes
[1:35:07] <$thesickestzak> Not sure if anyone can answer this, but I am currently playing through P5R for the first time and am in October. Can I watch Pat stream this without getting spoiled or is this a kind of stream where we're talking about spoilers that haven't happened in this play through yet. I know he beat the original
[1:35:19] <+Amaterasu_Nyan> thank god.
[1:35:25] <AutechreTwinAphex> I just think it's not ambitious enough to be pumping this out after 22+ years - I would have loved to see something with the production values of a Devil May Cry 5 instead with a Yuzo soundtrack
[1:35:36] <AutechreTwinAphex> either go big or go home is what I think about it
[1:35:39] <%NickCaesar7> @thesickestzak You'll probably be spoiled to hell
[1:35:49] <%Valentinius_Anodyne> @thesickestzak Pat's not that far in, but ya might want to avoid the stream anyhow just in case

[1:43:37] <%AncelDeLambert> "This coffee is hot" "Oh no! Why is this coffee hot?!"

[1:43:47] <%Dakuu75> @cureneckbeard yeah, he had to replace his sense of taste, with his sense of smell.

[1:50:47] <%Daniel_Is_I> This sounds so insincere because I give no fuck about art.
[1:50:49] <stevenellis386> tracings not a crime
[1:50:51] <%mechslayer71> So was it ever made clear as to whether kawakami was just doing the sexy nurse thing, or was she actually selling pussy? @chat
[1:50:52] <%BigCoffee> its funny
[1:50:54] <%griffball13> ART IS MORE IMPORTANT
[1:50:54] <%j0ustar> no shhh
[1:50:55] <%Mr_Pylon> it's disgusting

[1:51:00] <%CursedNobleman> haw, pussy LUL
[1:51:00] <%Legato_Ambrose> And not the "driving people to suicide" yes
[1:51:01] <%DappercatEsquire> The manslaughter was authentic, at least
[1:51:02] <%Typhaeon> Madarame is really miscast in the dub
[1:51:02] <%Divryne> MUH AAAARRRRT.
[1:51:02] <thetruenicster> He probably confesses to that later too
[1:51:03] <%heartlesshealer> Shhhhhh it's unsalvagable
[1:51:03] <%cvp5127> the murder was a bonus
[1:51:03] <%xcompleasedad> I think it's negligent homicide
[1:51:04] <%Strider222> what a loser
[1:51:04] <%appletumtum> Damn, he's going hard
[1:51:08] <%Ancopro> he's only sorry for plagiarism
[1:51:08] <%logoth_> Thats a one piece cry
[1:51:09] <%PlainSimpleTailor> JAPANESE VALUES, or something?
[1:51:12] <%Mr_Pylon> also the negligent homicide
[1:51:13] <%Nope80808> Nah Manslaughter's fine. Plagirisim is evil tho.
[1:51:13] <%televisedrevolting> And also the ruination of child lives.
[1:51:14] <%Aydarkzero> did Pat already play through streets of rage?

[1:51:48] <%mechslayer71> @aydarkzero He played some I think
[1:51:48] <%GoopyEuclid> This feels like the fucking scene in that one Neil Breen video
[1:51:51] <%Strider222> GEEZER
[1:51:53] <Crimpson> Like the reaction of people laughing about his crying is kind of correct. He is reporting that he plagiarized works instead of admitted that he was the cause of some people's killing himselves
[1:51:53] <+chaumiester> Wouldn't that be negligent homicide and not Manslaughter?
[1:51:55] <%Daniel_Is_I> It's probably just a private room at a normal hospital

[2:19:42] <%Treuan> Haven't you seen the crossdressing memes?
[2:19:43] <%Valentinius_Anodyne> Joker loves the crossdressing, it's canon
[2:19:44] <%rynfz> that's because ryuji isn't bishi
[2:19:45] <%CappuccinoGuil> ROCK IT, QUEEN
[2:19:48] <%JohnAtDawn> No you just have one
[2:19:48] <LeBlanc233> Joker ready to party
[2:19:48] <%xcompleasedad> Buy more prizes
[2:19:49] <%MisterRockett> Joker loving to cross dress is canon.
[2:19:53] <%nofestu2> that's because Bobby Hill loves wearing dresses
[2:19:56] <redrins> get belt
[2:19:58] <%televisedrevolting> Joker fucking loves looking hot.
[2:20:02] <%pectusumbra> ehhh. still, becky though
[2:20:03] <%Garthunox> @dredayy56 super wrong
[2:20:03] <RogueMinja> Morgana's best armor comes from the laundry at around endgame.
[2:20:05] <%dirtyh4rr1> and also purses
[2:20:06] <%HotBloodedHero> GET BELT
[2:20:07] <%linSP> That boy ain’t right
[2:20:08] <%Dr00_PhD> Laundry gives you better equipment though
[2:20:08] <%BluBox> Get more prizes, you have so many points
[2:20:10] <%Dragovus> @PatStaresAt Temple gives you SP
[2:20:10] <+Arkfyre> @dredayy56 You're 100% wrong, she does coffe, curry and laundry just like P5 base
[2:20:20] <%Quigsies> Max sp
[2:20:26] <%Dragovus> yeah
[2:20:26] <%nilla_24> temple gives sp
[2:20:27] <%televisedrevolting> Yes
[2:20:27] <+HypotheticalWalrus> like the gym but for sp
[2:20:30] <%mechslayer71> @rogueminja Implying anyone cares about Morganas gear, as if anyone cares about playing morgana LUL
[2:20:36] <+dredayy56> I mean she does MY laudry no longer
[2:20:36] <%PadreHail> Considering armor is almost useless in this game because of how fucking overpowered you can get it's honestly pointless to do laundry on Normal
[2:20:39] <OldManDeckardCain> stat ups carry over in ng+ in royal
[2:20:42] <%NickCaesar7> yeah. it carries over
[2:20:49] <%televisedrevolting> Go there and watch Joker become the 2nd Buddha
[2:20:53] <OldManDeckardCain> sit in front of the store
[2:20:58] <redrins> @PatStaresAt belt at the clothes shop is an accessory that gives you auto masukukaja at the start of every battle
[2:21:06] <jamesthebrave> Normal is hilariously easy, I haven't really tried the higher difficulties so I couldn't tell you what those are like.
[2:21:14] <RogueMinja> I mean, I have a need to give all my characters the best gear anyway.
[2:21:15] <%PadreHail> Merciless is FUN
[2:21:20] <$mrhappy6677> Yes
[2:21:20] <%pectusumbra> yeah
[2:21:23] <%xcompleasedad> Yes
[2:21:23] <+potbrick> yes
[2:21:26] <redrins> it's amazing
[2:21:26] <%reonome> @dredayy56 ??? she should still be able to, tf are you doing

[2:21:55] <%weissguard> @reonome He means to say that he just sells the Sooty stuff, rather than having Kawakami wash it.
[2:21:59] <%weissguard> Probably
[2:22:04] <%rynfz> The older i get the more i'm okay with easy games. I play the hardest game of being a responsible adult. lol
[2:22:13] <ShichiNoBushi> Stat up items?

[2:28:52] <%Maids4lyfe> TIME TO LEVEL UP BATON PASS
[2:28:54] <%reonome> morgana can do it too LUL
[2:28:58] <AlienWarhead> Darts obviously = Baton pass level up
[2:28:59] <+FierceDeityGabe> There's more than enough time to do it with everyone
[2:29:01] <Crimpson> That is one way to "balance" the game
[2:29:02] <%Razputin217> BUSTED
[2:29:03] <%Aydarkzero> i forgot who i had on my end team aside from Makoto LUL
[2:29:04] <OldManDeckardCain> you can get to max lvl in one go
[2:29:05] <%televisedrevolting> Billiards also increases Technical damage.
[2:29:07] <%linSP> The broken mechanic gets more broken
[2:29:10] <%pectusumbra> I mean it's a time investment right? Doing this means not doing S-links
[2:29:11] <stevenellis386> finally these kids can learn how to AIM
[2:29:12] <ShichiNoBushi> When it's not just Ann.
[2:29:13] <%CappuccinoGuil> DART PARTY
[2:29:26] <+FierceDeityGabe> Except it still is

[2:29:33] <%zyberion626> but it still is
[2:29:34] <%valriot> @patstaresat You're gonna want to play Pool as well, it increases chance of Technical knockdown and damage for the whole party
[2:29:36] <%reonome> its still the best thing
[2:29:37] <%Razputin217> How does Morgana throw darts?
[2:29:39] <+fgcmorad> I didn't even buy the SP things from Tae in Royal
[2:29:41] <%Kingjhon8> except dlc gives you free stuff
[2:29:47] <+FierceDeityGabe> Baton pass only recovers 2 sp

[2:30:13] <%Nope80808> Clack some balls
[2:30:15] <Crimpson> Can you have good luck with something bad?
[2:30:16] <%bread_assassin> Billiards gives you buffs, too.
[2:30:20] <%ALazo> pool also improves something
[2:30:21] <%narusao> you'll play now and you'll like it
[2:30:22] <bendatron> yeah but in p4 money was way way easier to come by than base 5
[2:30:25] <$mrhappy6677> *yakuza remastered billiards war flashbacks*

[2:31:00] <%PadreHail> @jamesthebrave you joke but one of the Akechi hangouts is SUPER horny

[2:53:48] <%XeroSigmaPrime> BUT MAKOTO
[2:53:49] <%Legato_Ambrose> Noooooooo
[2:53:49] <%StaceMcGate> BUT MAKOTO
[2:53:49] <%Dragovus> The power of Yoshizawa's cuteness is too much
[2:53:50] <%Zombrocom> She is the poochie
[2:53:53] <%42nfl19> @PatStaresAt How does rain get you sick? DO ALL JAPANESE HAVE WEAK CONSTITUTION? They all seem to die just by the common cold.
[2:53:53] <+azulezircon> It's annoying.

[2:53:59] <%Reveresao> NO PAT
[2:54:00] <%GohanHitsugaya> But Joker and Makoto are a power couple!
[2:54:00] <%Daniel_Is_I> This girl is not Rise.
[2:54:01] <Chimeraelite> I still like her
[2:54:02] <+jjjkopf> so Joker is into older women is LadyJoker into older men
[2:54:03] <%SpicyCheeseNips> THAT'S WHAT I THOUGHT AS WELL
[2:54:05] <%PadreHail> Nah Makoto has SO MUCH PHYSICAL CONTACT WITH JOKER
[2:54:05] <%NitronStreams> So youre saying Joker is into Selfcest?
[2:54:05] <%logoth_> SURLY male first year

[2:54:20] <%dekkitout> Dropkick that broad
[2:54:20] <kiwicoffin> New targets acquired
[2:54:20] <+fgcmorad> DO CRIME
[2:54:22] <+ZipperHands> @PatStaresAt Because ATLUS are too big of cowards of just making her the female protag
[2:54:22] <%logoth_> STOP APOLOGIZING
[2:54:23] <%JohnAtDawn> Its almost like they should have just made a lady joker especially since they put p3 femc in pq2
[2:54:23] <Zayasu> kasumi sucks :)
[2:54:24] <%pectusumbra> man wouldn't it be cool if you kept hearing rumors of weird stuff and it turned out she was doing phantom thief stuff on her own the whole game?
[2:54:26] <%CappuccinoGuil> HOW ABOUT WE MAKE IT NOT A MISUNDERSTANDING, EH???
[2:54:26] <%j0ustar> The fuck students
[2:54:28] <Merkensteiner> MARIE IS TRASH
[2:54:29] <%yoshkosh20> fight those children in the stteets!
[2:54:31] <%weissguard> Except Rise practically throws herself at you. Yoshizawa is just sociable. LUL Both are fine though.
[2:54:33] <Marpolo13> I'll just rob them at gunpoint later don't worry
[2:54:35] <%PanicSwytch> They should give allow people to choose a gender in future Persona games
[2:54:36] <%mechslayer71> @42nfl19 That’s the bounce back from the warlike days back in the day
[2:54:37] <%PadreHail> Makoto is literally the closest to Joker cock out of any character in the entire game
[2:54:39] <%aeonicvector> @NickCaesar7 Marie ACTIVLEY ruins all of goldens good shit
[2:54:43] <jyeowa> turn these streets into rage streets
[2:54:46] <%zyberion626> jokes aside, Kasumi is so much better than Marie. And I'm a marie defender
[2:54:47] <+AbnormalVoid> monkaS

[2:55:08] <%SpicyCheeseNips> A bit late acutally
[2:55:10] <bendatron> calling it right now her dad is ultra abusive
[2:55:11] <%CursedNobleman> its so hard being perfect and having a perfect family LUL
[2:55:11] <+AbnormalVoid> Pat, pls
[2:55:11] <%reonome> ON MAH DICK
[2:55:12] <+Fenris_Alexius> Yoshizawa is cool even before you get to the part of the game where she becomes center stage
[2:55:14] <%NickCaesar7> @aeonicvector Marie ia great. Fantastic addition to P4G
[2:55:14] <+jjjkopf> but does she have a daddy?
[2:55:15] <%griffball13> i can be your daddy
[2:55:17] <%supersugoisenpai1> I'll give you a ride. Nyuk nyuk nyuk
[2:55:19] <AlienWarhead> Joker: unlike me
[2:55:20] <%Reveresao> Money on that her dad dies
[2:55:21] <%walternatorz> "my family disowned me"
[2:55:23] <%doc_ock_rokc> The one thing I don't miss about gymnastics is how it ruined my hands
[2:55:25] <+Czar_Kazem> I wanna meet that dad
[2:55:25] <%RoggleJr> I'll give you the handy dandy leg splits.
[2:55:26] <Marpolo13> @yoshkosh20 it's not a crime if it' not reported Keepo
[2:55:28] <%SGrim> I, Joker, have a great dad too. We should make them related by getting married
[2:55:29] <jamesthebrave> I wish Haru had been handled the way Yoshizawa is. Let us talk to her and get to know her BEFORE she joins the party.
[2:55:32] <%JohnAtDawn> Wait why did she leave the school to go to practice?

[3:10:19] <%Reveresao> NotLikeThis
[3:10:22] <%yoshkosh20> all crabs are ocean spiders
[3:10:23] <%reonome> WutFace
[3:10:23] <%heartlesshealer> meat spoder
[3:10:31] <%toastybites> yeah but crabs are tastier tho
[3:10:35] <%Aeoneth> Too many legs
[3:10:36] <%UvBenServed> Delicious spiders
[3:10:37] <%Legato_Ambrose> all spider are meat spider. if you are brave enough
[3:10:43] <%Zombrocom> You think they would be used to your smarts by now
[3:10:44] <%GohanHitsugaya> Crabs are weird...
[3:10:45] <%yoshkosh20> tasty tasty ocean spiders
[3:10:48] <%heartlesshealer> not really?
[3:10:50] <%Aeoneth> I like a good pair of legs... but 10 legs are too many
[3:10:50] <%SpicyCheeseNips> King Crab is FUCKING DELICOUS
[3:10:55] <%CursedNobleman> hissing cockroaches apparently taste like chicken
[3:10:56] <%toastybites> had fried tarantula once and that was some sour shit
[3:10:58] <nesbitt22> the Claws count as legs?
[3:11:00] <%dekkitout> @Legato_Ambrose Sadly, no meaty crabs are in my area
[3:11:00] <+Fenris_Alexius> now I want sushi
[3:11:04] <%heartlesshealer> tiny spiders are just hydraulic pumps
[3:11:05] <%appletumtum> Wait, then where is the Crab's brain?
[3:11:07] <%Legato_Ambrose> The "Mona never gets sushi" begins
[3:11:09] <%worldbrand> nine vaganas
[3:11:11] <%JohnAtDawn> Why are spiders so much scarrier than crabs even though they are basically the same with or without armor?
[3:11:13] <+BloodyBurney> i thought all crabs are 8 legged but the pincers are part of the mouth?
[3:11:19] <%reonome> STFU RYUJI
[3:11:29] <%mechslayer71> @johnatdawn Eyes and venom
[3:11:30] <%heartlesshealer> it's why their legs twitch after death
[3:11:33] <%SpicyCheeseNips> Don't encourage Ryuji's stupidity Pat
[3:11:35] <jyeowa> did they already have post-palace celebration? with the hot pot?
[3:11:37] <%Valentinius_Anodyne> Morgana doesn't need sushi, just beans
[3:11:39] <%dekkitout> The fact that spiders traded armor for speed is probably why
[3:11:40] <%indig0bird> Oh, Ann was on her phone too
[3:11:41] <%worldbrand> @BloodyBurney true crabs are decapods, as in, ten legs
[3:11:45] <%spiritofmojave> Yusuke why use long words when short do trick
[3:11:47] <%JohnAtDawn> @mechslayer71 The venom is a good point
[3:11:50] <%ScreamLord> @PatStaresAt Hilariously, Spider Crabs are delicious and easy to catch but because they look like horrible nightmare monsters no one will eat them so they're not typically caught and sold in stores
[3:11:52] <QilinRequiem> see here's the thing: I question if Ryuji actually has good intentions or if just a gloryhound
[3:12:08] <%Engwithan_Elder_God> Snitches get stiches.
[3:12:09] <%worldbrand> spiders have eight legs and two grabby appendages called pedipalps, which are pincers in other arachnids such as scorpions
[3:12:15] <Marpolo13> LOL
[3:12:15] <%JohnAtDawn> GO TO THE POLICE
[3:12:17] <%Dragovus> Snitches get stitches
[3:12:21] <%kyh9> Go to the police, I guess

[3:14:58] <%yoshkosh20> everyone lets joker bring his cat because he's a big scary criminal.
[3:15:00] <olaksi> Time to "solve" the problem
[3:15:01] <%weissguard> Mishima is a bit much.
[3:15:01] <%spiritofmojave> It's almost like we never should have talked to him
[3:15:02] <+dredayy56> As soon as you go to the police, you then don’t trust the police
[3:15:05] <%logoth_> Its the only way. Kill Mishima
[3:15:11] <%debugdrawray_> its the ONLY WAY
[3:15:11] <%YakumoYomi> Why didn't Heihachi throw him off the cliff, instead of Kazuya?
[3:15:15] <%SpicyCheeseNips> WHY
[3:15:17] <jamesthebrave> It makes me very happy though how often the game gives you dialogue options to dunk on Mishima
[3:15:23] <%xcompleasedad> Mementos never
[3:15:24] <%mechslayer71> @weissguard He’s literally the worst. At least morgana can actually do stuff
[3:15:26] <%Dragovus> I'm glad Joker feeds Mishima to Ohya

[3:40:33] <+jjjkopf> yeah I bet that's what the trainers say to the cops too
[3:40:36] <%DensityD> bend the rules like bekham
[3:40:37] <%Engwithan_Elder_God> Chinese women naturally look like 12 years olds even when 30.
[3:40:38] <%vicar_anat> this loli-dragon is totally an adult
[3:40:41] <%D00msDayDan> it's true, i used to be able to reach the tip of my penis with my mouth when i was like 13 but now i can't
[3:40:43] <%reonome> its a condition
[3:40:43] <%hmgirlpopuri> Also a 14 year old could fall down 5 flights of stairs and pop up like nothing was wrong
[3:40:44] <%doc_ock_rokc> There are RARELY gymnasts above 23
[3:40:45] <%gespenst25> That's gymnasty
[3:40:45] <%ALazo> They still got milk teeth
[3:40:46] <+boondoggle42> Simone Biles is 23 and better than anyone has ever been
[3:40:47] <%ssjklyco> Commander, that still sounded nefarious
[3:40:50] <%GohanHitsugaya> They're adults, just in chibi form.
[3:40:52] <%DensityD> I want the loli-dragon to squeeze me
[3:40:52] <Jeemukun> Also the way gymnastics is, it tends to fuck with girls bodies, low body fat is bad during puberty
[3:40:55] <%heartlesshealer> required to turn 18 the day the olympics start
[3:40:58] <%Nordguy> i used to put my legs behind my head, now i can barely touch my feet when straight
[3:40:59] <pleas_play_persona_2> Please i really no one plays persona 2 even though it is really good and is totally worth your time it has possibly the best story in the series and is a experience you will never forget please just consider it

[3:41:09] <%walternatorz> orb tumble
[3:41:12] <+AbnormalVoid> tumbling down, tumbling down
[3:41:14] <%dekkitout> Your orb form is pretty optimized for tumbling
[3:41:18] <%DukeBlack_> @Fenris_Alexius ayyee
[3:41:18] <%ArchimerDreatect> tumbling's some BULLSHIT, pat
[3:41:19] <%Ipsenscastle> did he mean stumble?
[3:41:21] <%Nope80808> P!
[3:41:22] <%lotharrio> I tumble for ya. I'll tumble for ya...
[3:41:22] <%CommanderSqueaks> Pat, rolling is not tumbling.
[3:41:23] <%DensityD> if an orb tumbles, it's just a roll or rotation
[3:41:23] <%WanderingSwordsman> @patstaresat her rank 4 skill is the shit
[3:41:26] <%SGrim> @heartlesshealer of have a country to falsify the documents rooPog
[3:41:27] <%doc_ock_rokc> @Jeemukun At world level yes for state and regional level its not that bad
[3:41:29] <+blacklyon50> That boy ain't right
[3:41:32] <%heartlesshealer> that too
[3:41:32] <%MakotoPB> Pat can roll better than the guy in Hook

[3:41:36] <ManfredA> check her rank 4
[3:41:38] <OldManDeckardCain> pat already tumbling on his words
[3:41:39] <%gespenst25> yeah down the stairs
[3:41:39] <ShichiNoBushi> You could roll.
[3:41:42] <+rei0> look at it at your confidant list
[3:41:44] <+Arkfyre> rank 4 skill is real good
[3:41:44] <jamesthebrave> The long range ambush ability she gives you fucking rocks
[3:41:44] <%satans_finest_millennial> P5r just makes everything easier ehÉ
[3:41:48] <TheCondescendingOwl> you can only still tumble because you're built like a four year old patrick
[3:41:49] <%YakumoYomi> But can you recover, Pat? Your DEX bonus is shit.
[3:41:49] <%ScreamLord> down the stairs
[3:41:53] <%GohanHitsugaya> You'd probably break your back trying
[3:41:53] <@SoFarFetched> @pleas_play_persona_2 Persona you've been spamming the chat with talks of playing Persona 2. If you want to ask how he feels of Persona 2 on whether or not he plays it. Just donate to him and ask.

[3:41:57] <%DensityD> the video game said so
[3:41:59] <%walternatorz> @PatStaresAt will you tumble on stream?
[3:41:59] <%heartlesshealer> tumbling down the stairs doesn't count
[3:42:04] <%realm_forge> Retract ing your limbs into the orb and rolling isnt tumbling
[3:42:11] <%Nope80808> You cant tumble you can only Bumble.
[3:42:12] <%narusao> *giggle*

[4:13:35] <%cvp5127> ryuji thinks babies comes from storks
[4:13:35] <%CommanderSqueaks> Ryuji's a bitch
[4:13:37] <nyacoo> 4real
[4:13:37] <%GarbageNirvana> Like he could have just said something about Dome Town or rollercoasters
[4:13:40] <prophetdisharmonious> Akechi the kinda guy who has a tier list of all fast food resturants that sell pancakes.
[4:13:40] <%GarbageNirvana> But nope, pancakes
[4:13:41] <%MakotoPB> Any sentence you start with "Welp" is admission of being guilty of cringe
[4:13:42] <%hawk_rush> me neither
[4:13:45] <%Piemen99> ye cause you ROUND
[4:13:46] <%Daniel_Is_I> Roller coasters are fucking sick

[4:13:52] <%Piemen99> CAUSE OF THAT ORB
[4:13:52] <Jeemukun> low centre of gravity I bet
[4:13:53] <%NitronStreams> I barely feel anything on coasters
[4:13:54] <%TalisKanju> Pancakes!
[4:13:55] <%BluBox> I do on some but I don't for most
[4:13:56] <jyeowa> don't those have a height requirement?
[4:13:57] <+Fenris_Alexius> As long as I don't stuff myself, I'm good for anything
[4:13:58] <%CommanderSqueaks> Low center of gravity
[4:13:59] <%doc_ock_rokc> I'm immune to motion sickness
[4:14:00] <%dekkitout> Pancakes? Do they mean funnel cakes?
[4:14:02] <%MakotoPB> After you starting climbing on Paige?
[4:14:02] <+Merhabi> Was that an age thing?
[4:14:03] <%j0ustar> Pat, you have your own gravitational field to help
[4:14:03] <%Robot_Nixon_> I just hate waiting in the lines
[4:14:03] <%Daniel_Is_I> I'm afraid of heights but only when I'm not going fast.
[4:14:05] <%clumbos_edgier_uncle> I know that feel, I used to black out on roller coasters. Than at some point I got over it
[4:14:05] <%weissguard> @GarbageNirvana He didn't know who spoke, did he?
[4:14:06] <%TalisKanju> Wait did they change the scene?
[4:14:07] <NiktenKing> Short men must conquer heights
[4:14:09] <%lilytastic> Is there a photo of you on a roller coaster
[4:14:09] <%Ancopro> i can't breathe on rollercoasters.
[4:14:13] <%Verd_254> pat you're not tall enough to ride rollercoastera
[4:14:14] <%appletumtum> Can't get sick if you never get on them, that's how I roll
[4:14:16] <%Taglog7> Heights always surprise me
[4:14:16] <vampireinarm> @GarbageNirvana he couldnt see them and dosent know them, so he couldnt have known it was morgana who said it
[4:14:18] <%spiritofmojave> I just get a headache but never puke

[4:16:29] <+Standard_Enemy> Kiryu would DESTROY joker at darts
[4:16:30] <%hawk_rush> D:
[4:16:31] <%Rancaliber_> Jesus, where'd the chain smoking grandma come from?
[4:16:31] <%ssjklyco> Time to dart to progress
[4:16:31] <+Merhabi> Wait until you have two people
[4:16:34] <%Daniel_Is_I> But Pat, completionist?
[4:16:35] <%Dragovus> Lala is the best
[4:16:36] <Jeemukun> play pool
[4:16:36] <%Garthunox> @patstaresat you can probably start iwai, he was reduced to only need 3 guts
[4:16:37] <+Merhabi> oh damn
[4:16:39] <%spiritofmojave> Yusuke is legit good tho
[4:16:39] <%j0ustar> They're dead now
[4:16:39] <%hawk_rush> poor yusuke and morgana

[4:16:41] <%WanderingSwordsman> try pool
[4:16:46] <ManfredA> oh just ignoring two great party members
[4:16:47] <%Valentinius_Anodyne> But I want to see how Morgana plays darts
[4:16:48] <%ssjklyco> This will increase your Technical attacks
[4:16:50] <Jeemukun> DESTORY NINE BALL
[4:16:56] <%TenderBabyBacon> I would totally play a darts game with sega Characters
[4:16:59] <+Vikingdeath1> Yusuke may be Good, but he also "Sucks ass", so ignore the hell outta him
[4:17:05] <+Calern> damn, guess you're not good enough to rank them all
[4:17:05] <%hawk_rush> I found yusuke to be super super good
[4:17:06] <%spiritofmojave> Haru <3
[4:17:10] <Blackjack760> yay Haru
[4:17:11] <+Merhabi> you should probably max everyone's baton pass
[4:17:13] <+Fenris_Alexius> ...you're gonna be waiting a while
[4:17:14] <%Daniel_Is_I> Fuck Ryuji, get Haru in there all the time
[4:17:18] <%Lewtskie> Ann doesn't exist
[4:17:18] <%pectusumbra> pat used yusuke in his first run
[4:17:20] <%hawk_rush> my team's ryuji, yusuke and haru
[4:17:22] <%cumurasame> Pat, you're not going to use YOU KNOW WHO?

[4:17:25] <%GohanHitsugaya> What about Makoto?
[4:17:25] <%Ipsenscastle> Pro jobs
[4:17:29] <PirateMike_> ann looks like blowup doll
[4:17:29] <ShichiNoBushi> "What's a cue stick?"
[4:17:34] <%Aydarkzero> poor Yusuke never says anything
[4:17:40] <brizzlewa> My end game was Ann, Haru, new girl.

[4:17:50] <%appletumtum> Just go feral on the table
[4:17:51] <%Aydarkzero> he's saying something!
[4:17:52] <%cumurasame> I used DABOIS in the end
[4:17:53] <%GohanHitsugaya> Ha ha, balls
[4:17:53] <%GarbageNirvana> Is new girl even a party member? Kinda seems like she just does her own thing
[4:17:57] <Ranger747> God I wanna play pool
[4:17:59] <%CommanderSqueaks> Yusuke loves the sound of balls going into holes
[4:18:03] <OldManDeckardCain> makoto's trait is kinda whatever, glad I could bench her easily LUL
[4:18:11] <%Taglog7> BibleThump fun w/ friends
[4:18:17] <%cvp5127> @PatStaresAt but dont you want to see their 3rd tier personas
[4:18:18] <%appletumtum> Just swing the cue balls into the air using your cue stick as a bat
[4:18:20] <+AtlasMcCoy> Thanks random stranger
[4:18:21] <BoneofMalkav> Pump it up, like your feet are stompin while the jam in bumpin gotta keep that whole crowd jumpin' LUL
[4:18:22] <%Noahccountingfortaste> what? I thought Makoto's trait was super good
[4:18:24] <Gameaholic42> Go back to the mall
[4:18:25] <%televisedrevolting> @garbagenirvana Would you like to know or are you simply posing a question?
[4:18:25] <%cumurasame> @GarbageNirvana You see her in the new opening section of Sae's palace so you know she joins at some point (which is...)
[4:18:26] <%Ipsenscastle> Don't trust him, he's casually dressed

[4:18:31] <Jeemukun> thanks shitty adult
[4:18:31] <PirateMike_> whats the difference between pool and billiard?
[4:18:32] <%Quigsies> You get more later
[4:18:33] <%topendbuzza> yep
[4:18:33] <+Merhabi> No mini game, sorry
[4:18:35] <%hawk_rush> @GarbageNirvana she comes in later
[4:18:35] <%ImmaCanuck> ??????
[4:18:36] <ShichiNoBushi> No minigme?
[4:18:36] <%Dr00_PhD> You haven't unlocked trick shots yet
[4:18:37] <OldManDeckardCain> compared to others? nah
[4:18:37] <brizzlewa> Makoto's trait makes Ann stronger.
[4:18:39] <%Noahccountingfortaste> read the book and do it
[4:18:39] <RogueMinja> You get stuff once you get the book.
[4:18:39] <+Fenris_Alexius> told ya
[4:18:40] <%Valentinius_Anodyne> Sorry nothing
[4:18:40] <DiscoNinjaWolf> reset
[4:18:41] <%j0ustar> "I forgot to mention, I wrote that book!"
[4:18:41] <%Aydarkzero> but number go up
[4:18:42] <%JohnAtDawn> It gets worth it later
[4:18:43] <Kyphen15> It was never worth it in my opinion
[4:18:43] <%Daniel_Is_I> You get 2 guts and some friendship points
[4:18:44] <%hawk_rush> that's why darts is always besst
[4:18:44] <+rei0> you need to do more for the actual reward
[4:18:44] <%reonome> read the book first
[4:18:44] <%pectusumbra> eh, 2 guts and confidant is fine
[4:18:45] <Fujiwara_92> More later
[4:18:45] <+Vikingdeath1> you have to do it again later I think
[4:18:47] <Brute_Mstr> boo no minigsmr
[4:18:48] <rubbishbinge> Rotten adults telling you to read about billiards
[4:18:48] <Gameaholic42> It gets amazing after you read the book
[4:18:48] <%griffball13> SPLOOSH
[4:18:49] <%valriot> @PatStaresAt Go buy the book in underground mall
[4:18:49] <+Fenris_Alexius> FUCK ME AKECHI!
[4:18:51] <%narusao> he's dreamy
[4:18:51] <%cumurasame> Your Technical Damage increases is RIDICULOUS once it maxes out
[4:18:52] <TheHotStuven> AYAYA
[4:18:52] <%Dragovus> It increases Technical damage after you play more
[4:18:52] <%appletumtum> PANCAKE MON
[4:18:52] <%hawk_rush> before doing billiards
[4:18:55] <%Garthunox> @patstaresat that's only what it's like for the first time
[4:18:55] <Jeemukun> SPLOOSH
[4:18:57] <%luckysteak> Rank 4 makes technical attacks down the enemies, super useful for foes with no weeknesses @PatStaresAt
[4:18:57] <+Merhabi> A Multi-Day field trip?
[4:18:57] <%Ynkubus18> So many jetpacks
[4:18:59] <%GohanHitsugaya> psaBig Sploosh!
[4:19:01] <+Merhabi> Really?
[4:19:03] <%ScreamLord> psaBig Sploosh
[4:19:03] <%JohnAtDawn> Yes
[4:19:03] <thetruenicster> Yes
[4:19:04] <+Fenris_Alexius> yes
[4:19:04] <%topendbuzza> yep
[4:19:04] <%pectusumbra> yes
[4:19:05] <%zyberion626> yup
[4:19:05] <+RicardoRuizr> @patstaresat you have to read book and buy a cue and then it’s mega worth it
[4:19:06] <%cumurasame> Which is more than WEAKNESS and with Merciless Bonus....
[4:19:06] <+rei0> yep
[4:19:07] <%Dragovus> yep
[4:19:07] <RogueMinja> Yes.
[4:19:07] <%Garthunox> yep
[4:19:07] <%Noahccountingfortaste> status combos
[4:19:08] <%Razputin217> SPLOOSH
[4:19:09] <+Standard_Enemy> Yeah its big damage
[4:19:10] <+Merhabi> It's for people without weaknesses
[4:19:11] <Fujiwara_92> Yup
[4:19:11] <samiscoolbro> si
[4:19:13] <+Vikingdeath1> they apparently buffed Technical damage somehow
[4:19:13] <%ssjklyco> If you play billiards later, you increae your technical damage level so that it knocks them down 100% of the time
[4:19:13] <ManfredA> it has many different combos
[4:19:16] <brizzlewa> Yes. Different status require different hits, though.
[4:19:17] <+Calern> at max level it's guarantteed knock down
[4:19:17] <+rei0> it's real big in royal, they buff the shit out of technical damage
[4:19:19] <%pectusumbra> so phys on a sleeping person, wind on a burning target, psy on mental status, ect
[4:19:20] <%JohnAtDawn> And if you level it up you can gurantee that they get knocked down
[4:19:21] <PirateMike_> d i d s o m o n e s a y p a n c a k e s?
[4:19:22] <%reonome> "i want to eat some pancakes"
[4:19:22] <thetruenicster> #NotMyDetectivePrince
[4:19:25] <%hawk_rush> technical damage = A+
[4:19:28] <+RicardoRuizr> Technical damage is broken in Royal
[4:19:30] <%BoomerUnchained> Where's the little window with the guy, who can't believe what he sees?
[4:19:31] <%rumtumtugnutz> This is the guy from Detective Conan huh
[4:19:33] <%Dr00_PhD> Hi Aigis
[4:19:35] <%Garthunox> theres also a book that increases the variety of technical combos you can perform
[4:19:37] <%spiritofmojave> hey Aegis
[4:19:38] <%TalisKanju> Is that announcer's voice the same as Aigis?
[4:19:40] <olaksi> What's with all these teenage detectives
[4:19:41] <+Merhabi> Okay wait, didn't Akechi have Tan gloves?
[4:19:45] <brizzlewa> Tech damage is great because later enemies don't have weakensses.
[4:19:45] <%spiritofmojave> yep that she
[4:19:46] <%PlainSimpleTailor> This guy is such a melvin
[4:19:46] <%lotharrio> "Yes. I want pancakes."
[4:19:53] <brizzlewa> Tech and crits are king late game.
[4:19:58] <%zeif00> Akechi-coom

[4:24:15] <%heartlesshealer> I think the more pressing question is how the crimes went undetected and unpunished in the fucking first place Akechi. Without that no one would need the Phantom Thieves
[4:24:15] <%yoshkosh20> jerk him off harder, announcer man.

[4:32:46] <%heartlesshealer> like that LeYawn tweet about leaving someone's name in the retweets?
[4:32:46] <%YakumoYomi> @Daniel_Is_I Agreed. But considering how the last stretch of the game plays out (in the original game), it's not surprising.
[4:32:49] <%MakotoPB> The thing that makes it dubious is that they are unknowingly suddenly changing their entire personality. If you were a normal person looking at it you would think some real fucked up shit must have happened to make these people do a fucking 720 on their personality
[4:32:49] <%SaiyanShoto> Pat has simps?
