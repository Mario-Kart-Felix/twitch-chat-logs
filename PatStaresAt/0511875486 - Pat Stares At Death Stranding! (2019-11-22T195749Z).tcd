[0:51:17] <mayorrev> @AngriestPat is the hot spring like a repair spray for human cargo?

[0:53:32] <%deviljhojho_> soak it in
[0:53:32] <%joylent_blue> this is so weird
[0:53:32] <LethalPlacebo> @valkuma The other voices are supposedly other players in proximity.
[0:53:33] <%BallerSwagBro9k> This probaly makes sense in Japan
[0:53:33] <GMN1> kojima is weird man
[0:53:37] <NotHereToStream> the signs are singing too

[0:53:59] <$HeroToxiko> If momma was here, she would sing too FeelsBadMan
[0:54:02] <%Doomcoder> Such a relaxing bath. Feels like I just fucking died
[0:54:02] <%XeroSigmaPrime> 2/10 NOT ENUF BOOB

[0:54:19] <BurningLlama777> Aww
[0:54:22] <+sir_louis> The blood is exfoliating
[0:54:24] <%oAznoUta> 7/10 TOO MUCH WATER
[0:54:27] <%J_Papa> I guess it acted like she was still in the shroud, so no hair
[0:54:28] <%Meow0369> They'd have no way of knowing it was coming because they're not wearing their suits
[0:54:29] <%Divryne> Her hair is a STRAND.
[0:54:32] <42nfl19> Wait so the hotsprings did not heal her?
[0:54:37] <%Nope80808> Yooo I just realized Mama is that chick from the shitty Death Note moive.
[0:54:41] <mattrutland> he doesnt use soap in the shower either, filthy peasant
[0:54:41] <Habblewater> wow
[0:54:41] <mayorrev> HAHAHA
[0:54:42] <D3rrtyD4n> mama needs to be hosed down
[0:54:45] <CruxSA> david cage would be proud
[0:54:45] <%Nope80808> The netflix one.
[0:54:46] <%Doomcoder> she's also Jill Garvey from the Leftovers!
[0:54:48] <%BallerSwagBro9k> Funny Woolie is currently watching Narutos birth and Pat ended Mama 's child
[0:54:50] <CanadianAnimatorGuy> @nope80808 WHAT
[0:54:56] <wannabemoogle> honestly the blood might be good to have on her in theory to ward off ghosts
[0:54:59] <%Nope80808> @CanadianAnimatorGuy
[0:54:59] <Camail> ziiiiiiiiiiip
[0:55:02] <%Laecerelius> It's fine, she's covered in Sam's blood so she's ghost resistant now

[0:55:17] <Camail> mama's probably having a great time
[0:55:22] <allanmiri> Wait there's a naruto LP with woolie?
[0:55:25] <+netrac> does mama work as a anti ghost melee weapon?
[0:55:26] <%Keyd00d> chris's blood

[0:55:47] <BurningLlama777> Well I mean... you *could* kill someone and then just cut their cord.

[0:55:56] <Habblewater> Get Hardman
[0:55:57] <StonerStan101> Like most Kojima games. Kills = Bad ending.
[0:55:59] <Demon_chann> no i mean die hard man fuck
[0:56:00] <hectic_harlequin> Oh cool, the "The Sorrow" thing you predicted came true.
[0:56:00] <42nfl19> But Reedus is a boomer himself
[0:56:02] <%supersugoisenpai1> Pat built almost all of these
[0:56:04] <%xtremegamer80> Ok Boomman
[0:56:05] <Kiraklene> Ok Doomer
[0:56:08] <Crimpson> My shard just made roads.. I made all the ziplines in the mountains
[0:56:08] <%SlimeSlimeSlime> @mikash91 You got it man
[0:56:08] <+TheShisno> Okay Womber
[0:56:10] <wannabemoogle> He needs the guns for the ghosts not people
[0:56:11] <%DedlokPM> @42nfl19 ok boomer
[0:56:11] <NotHereToStream> listen, a couple of bodies are a necessary evil to save america
[0:56:12] <%Bane_Kaikyo> DICK HARDMAN!!
[0:56:13] <+machshop> if kojima makes a sequel to this, will there be a Live Free or Die-Hardman?
[0:56:15] <Aydarkzero> man this zipline kind of makes the game pointless
[0:56:15] <%Laecerelius> Time to ride!
[0:56:16] <artificiallynatural> what are you gonna do, kill me?
[0:56:16] <%Bailey__gaming> real talk should i worry that the later i get this game the easier it will be due to all the roads and massive zipplines across the map?
[0:56:22] <+jojoeyjojo> zipline simulator
[0:56:23] <+terry_quest> nice walking sim LUL
[0:56:28] <%marvel877> Why are you over here?
[0:56:31] <42nfl19> "Bitches love speed skeletons"
[0:56:31] <D3rrtyD4n> atpCap
[0:56:31] <hectic_harlequin> @machshop I can see LiveFreeMan
[0:56:33] <Dr_Mooose> got it, thanks Pat
[0:56:37] <%supersugoisenpai1> Gotta go fast
[0:56:39] <%SlimeSlimeSlime> Not what I heard.
[0:56:39] <reasonance> gotta finish the job quickly, right?
[0:56:39] <Mister_McDerp> S P E E D
[0:56:40] <%President_Miyazaki> But you need more power
[0:56:42] <%GarbageNirvana> There was a whole chunk of exposition you skipped by doing that
[0:56:43] <%Laecerelius> what happens if you rest in your private room?
[0:56:44] <mikash91> Do you think it'll only be lady transport missions? no men?
[0:56:45] <Aydarkzero> the faster you go the happier she'll be Kappa
[0:56:47] <ShineTheDiamond> How much longer is this game?
[0:56:47] <+TheShisno> Send Mama to the locker
[0:56:49] <seycheles> hard speed
[0:56:49] <CanadianAnimatorGuy> Speed Ladyman
[0:56:49] <+Ell1ot> put her in your private locker
[0:56:50] <+netrac> Store mama on your private locker
[0:56:50] <Meta_Four> Can you put Mama in the locker?
[0:56:50] <agumon9000> PUT MAMA IN THE PRIVATE LOCKER
[0:56:52] <Habblewater> make sure to cover them in your DNA too
[0:56:53] <wannabemoogle> they like being put into a bag and look like a silk worm
[0:56:53] <D3rrtyD4n> store mama
[0:56:55] <mattrutland> ladies love speed skeleton. important tip, noted
[0:56:58] <+machshop> Ghost-Bustman
[0:56:59] <Mister_McDerp> can she be put in a locker?
[0:57:00] <%Zulrez> no pat ladies like the power, cause big number better than bid dps
[0:57:01] <%SlashHabit> SlashHabit subscribed with Twitch Prime. They've subscribed for 2 months, currently on a 1 month streak! are we best friends now?
[0:57:03] <a_mad_dragon> RECYCLE MAMA
[0:57:06] <cheesedburgers> Minute man Sam porter bridges strand
[0:57:07] <hectic_harlequin> Put Mama on a carrier
[0:57:07] <%Laecerelius> Please don't recycle the mama
[0:57:09] <%Ner234> @ShineTheDiamond This is chapter 5 of 15. So still ways to go
[0:57:10] <wannabemoogle> become skeleton got it
[0:57:11] <LethalPlacebo> How does his utility pouch have so many slots for blood? Is there an upgrade?
[0:57:13] <%xtremegamer80> @Bailey__gaming Structures don't come up until there is a chiral connection, they slowly degrade in the timefall, and sometimes you don't see the same as others
[0:57:14] <%wookie5358> that seems like the worst way to give a piggyback ride
[0:57:15] <%GarbageNirvana> She goes on about how she remembers being in the womb and how they were conjoined twins and shit if you walk
[0:57:19] <Aydarkzero> make more guns
[0:57:19] <ape_hawk> can you recycle mama?
[0:57:28] <+Posh_Cat> Accidentally recycles mama Kappa
[0:57:29] <%Laecerelius> Pat has a second utility pouch on his backpack
[0:57:30] <%Bailey__gaming> @AngriestPat i hope Mama throws money at you every time you do cool shit on the way to where she needs to go like the passenegrs in Crazy Taxi
[0:57:34] <Demon_chann> bam bam bam
[0:57:36] <42nfl19> what about a blood gun just encase?
[0:57:37] <LethalPlacebo> @Laecerelius Thanks!
[0:57:39] <ShineTheDiamond> @Ner234 Lord almighty. This is a long game
[0:57:43] <Mister_McDerp> can you take her in a truck?
[0:57:44] <%Doomcoder> Give Mama a Gun
[0:57:53] <%Ner234> @ShineTheDiamond It is. I was surprised too.
[0:58:00] <%wookie5358> carry her in your hand
[0:58:01] <wannabemoogle> hell just drag her
[0:58:02] <%deviljhojho_> its bluud
[0:58:03] <%Laecerelius> Yeah, Mama needs a gun so you can go all Blaster Master on people's asses

[0:58:19] <Dr_Mooose> put her in the cart
[0:58:26] <%Animorphimagi> i love that Pat has the hat gold also
[0:58:32] <NotHereToStream> man this banjo kazooie game looks weird Kappa
[0:58:35] <%Laecerelius> Oh man, did this game just become Banjo Kazooie?
[0:58:42] <D3rrtyD4n> xxxBONGJIMA

[0:58:53] <%supersugoisenpai1> Touhou bro
[0:58:55] <+kill_gill_aas> In your opinion what is the point of this game?
[0:58:55] <%Bailey__gaming> KANEDA!
[0:58:56] <%Madbearv> do the slide
[0:58:56] <Demon_chann> i cant belive 2 people made the same joke seconds apart

[0:59:00] <%cureneckbeard> TETSUOOOO
[0:59:00] <hectic_harlequin> @AngriestPat Death Stranding vs Metal Gear Solid, any thoughts? Is it a fair comparison?
[0:59:01] <%deviljhojho_> Akiraaaaaaaaaa
[0:59:03] <corpsegoo> I am so glad you can bring people on vehicles unlike certain hand carried cargo
[0:59:05] <%Madbearv> do an akira pat
[0:59:06] <+ClaudeMcGarren> @kill_gill_aas yes
[0:59:09] <%Saltmeisterr> KANEDA
[0:59:10] <%SlimeSlimeSlime> We're doing fine man, how are you doing?
[0:59:12] <+Double_Tap_That> This reminds me of "Ride with Norman Reedus"
[0:59:14] <D3rrtyD4n> vs? LUL
[0:59:23] <%Deano8817> oof
[0:59:31] <Demon_chann> man 5 has great gameplay
[0:59:33] <PkSilent01> We Akira now
[0:59:34] <%Keyd00d> TETSUOOOOO
[0:59:36] <mayorrev> Do you think Metal Gear will ever be the same? @AngriestPat
[0:59:37] <%SlimeSlimeSlime> You mean "V" right?
[0:59:38] <%SlashHabit> quiet was good
[0:59:39] <%Saltmeisterr> doesn't kojima own an Akira bike
[0:59:40] <%BallerSwagBro9k> But Quiet tho.....
[0:59:41] <corpsegoo> death stranding certainly makes me desperately want to see kojima do a dedicated horror game
[0:59:42] <HyperBomb21> 5 appeals to people who play MGS for the gameplay, not for the story
[0:59:43] <%Laecerelius> It was fun watching Plague fuck about in 5
[0:59:46] <mayorrev> :(
[0:59:48] <Dr_Mooose> that gameplay is great
[0:59:48] <%BallerSwagBro9k> MG is dead
[0:59:48] <Themightymightyena> what about 4?
[0:59:49] <hectic_harlequin> Makes sense. It's Kojima's second open-world game, so he's learned a bit from his mistakes
[0:59:49] <+ClaudeMcGarren> @Demon_chann mechanics sure but the story and maps were terrible
[0:59:51] <D3rrtyD4n> its over
[0:59:52] <Aydarkzero> Metal Gear is dead
[0:59:53] <katocrimson> metal gear pachinko
[0:59:56] <+kill_gill_aas> @ClaudeMcGarren
[0:59:59] <%Keyd00d> V is garbage
[1:00:00] <D3rrtyD4n> mgs5 would have been my favorite
[1:00:01] <%Madbearv> Kojima is free
[1:00:01] <Demon_chann> @ClaudeMcGarren true
[1:00:01] <%GarbageNirvana> MGS3 was the peak for sure
[1:00:01] <%misha_kastrilevich> @AngriestPat Would you recommend Death Stranding?
[1:00:02] <%deviljhojho_> Bury it
[1:00:02] <+kill_gill_aas> ?
[1:00:03] <cheesedburgers> MGSV plays like a dream but everything around it blows far chunks
[1:00:03] <a_mad_dragon> FUCK KONAMI SwiftRage
[1:00:04] <%DedlokPM> @hectic_harlequin not really a fair comparison as they are going for different things imo
[1:00:13] <Psyramics> Metal Gear is just a cashcow for Konami now, it'll never be anything again unless it can be wrested from them
[1:00:14] <%Madbearv> and given this game, Kojima is better free
[1:00:15] <+Posh_Cat> 3was the best IMO
[1:00:23] <%xtremegamer80> Man I wish we could play like Stylo in-game
[1:00:24] <artificiallynatural> still amazed at the optimization on mgsv. played even on my shitty computer
[1:00:28] <Habblewater> It will live on through Pachinko
[1:00:31] <%Doomcoder> @AngriestPat any news from your secret leak source about playable Vergil /s
[1:00:34] <TheDr0t> @angriestpat so wait you builded the road up to mount knot?
[1:00:37] <BurningLlama777> I'm okay with Metal Gear Solid being over.
[1:00:38] <%Ner234> THat animation is annoying
[1:00:39] <%Meow0369> Every time you use this road this happens
[1:00:42] <%Meow0369> it's so fucking annoying
[1:00:46] <%cureneckbeard> Fall off the fuckin' cliff loser!
[1:00:48] <%Laecerelius> Man it stopping every time you hit ghosts is lame
[1:00:48] <hectic_harlequin> Yeah, I was just wondering, considering they're both have the same developer and have some overlap in some themes.
[1:00:48] <HyperBomb21> yes this is a flaw
[1:00:49] <%wookie5358> someone needs to start on iron cog soft
[1:00:50] <Dr_Mooose> whiplash?
[1:00:53] <%Bane_Kaikyo> @AngriestPat I don't think we can hear PAige.... tell her to speak into the mic
[1:00:55] <%DedlokPM> with konami in charge? mgs might as well be dead both in the chance one will be made and in the way we know it
[1:00:59] <%xtremegamer80> OH
[1:01:01] <%marvel877> Yeah, he grinded and built roads, to trivialize everything.
[1:01:02] <corpsegoo> tbh all konami needs to do to print money is turn those mgs3 cutscenes they redid into a remake
[1:01:03] <%xtremegamer80> NEW MECHANIC
[1:01:03] <%supersugoisenpai1> Is this Ride to Hell: Retribution?
[1:01:04] <Mister_McDerp> fucking ghosts and their unskippable cutscenes
[1:01:05] <D3rrtyD4n> in retrospect, how much of mgs5 can we blame on konami or was it just kojima being kojima? @AngriestPat
[1:01:09] <+ClaudeMcGarren> @Demon_chann like imo first off who gives a fuck about some dude wiht plastic surgery venom is the weakest cause hes not even related to them in any way lol
[1:01:13] <$velgaduere> where we're going, we won't need cord cutters. only ROADS
[1:01:24] <%shootbang_exe> ride to hell: mama
[1:01:35] <+ultimafullmetal> Pretty sure that animation is masking a loading screen for loading BT's.
[1:01:36] <%SlimeSlimeSlime> Has anyone ever ridden a motorbike as a backwards passenger? Looks like a good time to me.
[1:01:47] <+TheShisno> Haven't cut cords like that since I dumped AT&T

[1:06:56] <GMN1> STAY STRONG YOU DIPSHIT
[1:06:58] <42nfl19> This is one scenario that the sticky gun would help.
[1:07:01] <%honeyman18> Good Jorb
[1:07:01] <%Valdorick> Dicks out for Bike-chan.
[1:07:01] <bigbrothergannon> only on this stream lmfao
[1:07:02] <ArtoriasTheTrenchfighter> Check her cargo damage?
[1:07:03] <%Nope80808> This is the real Death note.
[1:07:05] <Mister_McDerp> it was a harrowing experience for sam
[1:07:06] <%SlashHabit> so uh, wouldn't timefall water be in that river? Her puss is fucked up Pat, good job, B rank.
[1:07:12] <%Laecerelius> That lady should be losing her shit right now
[1:07:12] <wannabemoogle> stay strong as I float down this steam like trash
[1:07:15] <+terry_quest> fuck thats some funny shit
[1:07:16] <agumon9000> @AngriestPat Pat going through the mountains would have been 100% easier and faster
[1:07:16] <%marvel877> SHE TAKES DAMAGE
[1:07:17] <%Doomcoder> no, timefall stops being timefall as soon as it hits something
[1:07:18] <%SlimeSlimeSlime> Pat did you just "LOL" in real life?
[1:07:21] <emperor_z> Timefall turns into normal water after it touches down
[1:07:21] <%Meow0369> 21 percent is a lot of damage for a human
[1:07:22] <42nfl19> "The mother otter fluffs her pup so much the he will not sink."
[1:07:23] <+Ell1ot> she took drowning damage
[1:07:24] <%This_is_Marco> its fine LUL
[1:07:26] <%takiyami> LUL
[1:07:27] <+Maldoree> NotLikeThis
[1:07:28] <%ArcanumMBD> @SlashHabit the timefall only happens with rain. It expends the timefuckery energy when it hits something
[1:07:28] <$velgaduere> @SlashHabit timefall only matters when it's falling
[1:07:28] <%marvel877> Well...
[1:07:28] <+netrac> people have reagen
[1:07:29] <+sir_louis> monkaS
[1:07:29] <%Strider222> @SlashHabit Timefall water is just normal water once it hits the ground
[1:07:30] <%SGrim> @AngriestPat Good job turning Mama into damaged goods Kappa
[1:07:31] <vaderxyz1970> just think of all that water still in the bag
[1:07:32] <wannabemoogle> oh no she have leg broken
[1:07:34] <Mister_McDerp> 21% dead
[1:07:35] <HyperBomb21> @SlashHabit timefall turns into normal water upon contact with the earth
[1:07:35] <%XeroSigmaPrime> LOL
[1:07:36] <D3rrtyD4n> - 21% is still a high C
[1:07:37] <%honeyman18> Mostly Alive
[1:07:41] <%Bane_Kaikyo> 21 Damage is NOT Braindead
[1:07:41] <+Mr_Pylon> quick spray her with the axe luggage spray
[1:07:42] <%wookie5358> we're okay. humans only use 10% of their brain
[1:07:42] <%This_is_Marco> spray some stuff on her
[1:07:44] <%marvel877> Now she's damaged like Paige.
[1:07:44] <allanmiri> Well... that was a fun little adventure
[1:07:45] <wannabemoogle> she's fine
[1:07:47] <+rendingmelody> is she drunk agaian? LUL
[1:07:48] <%linSP> damaged mama
[1:07:50] <%SlashHabit> and pusses everyone that attet at me
[1:07:50] <Nagamune> My 21% damaged sister LUL
[1:07:52] <%AbnormalVoid> Can't get Legend of Legends grade on story missions, so they don't matter
[1:07:53] <cheesedburgers> Yeah I don’t know if people get hurt when you throw them off cliffs and get hit by ghost lions
[1:07:54] <Crimpson> Don't worry.. That 21% dmg is just her tubes
[1:07:55] <Habblewater> Can you spray her?
[1:07:55] <+netrac> heart still beating at delivery
[1:07:57] <D3rrtyD4n> punished mama
[1:07:57] <GMN1> just missing a limb, nothing much
[1:07:59] <%Doomcoder> Burned one Mama and drowned the other
[1:08:01] <coracor> monkaS
[1:08:02] <black_pariah> did anybody clip that
[1:08:02] <%ArcanumMBD> @SlashHabit it's because there's a fuck ton of chiralium (the time fucky material) in the clouds. And there's permanent Chiralium cloud coverage in the world now
[1:08:05] <%Laecerelius> Time to get mama shot!
[1:08:06] <%Valdorick> Can't wait for the Mules and BTs to double team you.
[1:08:08] <Demon_chann> can you double jump
[1:08:08] <%Ner234> I haven't laughed like that in a long while. Thanks Pat. Truly.

[1:08:11] <Mister_McDerp> hope it wasn't her brain that got damaged
[1:08:13] <Mendin> Big Homo Demons
[1:08:14] <emperor_z> The roads here arent super important fortunately. It's easy to drive vans through the marsh
[1:08:17] <%Meow0369> This whole area sucks dick prioritise getting all the roads here built off stream next time
[1:08:19] <%Animorphimagi> mmmm hahaha
[1:08:19] <%SlimeSlimeSlime> That means you can cover the entire valley, with their blood. =D
[1:08:19] <%linSP> mules gonna steal mama
[1:08:19] <%marvel877> Should've climbed the mountain.
[1:08:20] <%Divryne> Mama gonna get SHOT.
[1:08:21] <42nfl19> can't pat do the anti-pulse things?
[1:08:21] <+terry_quest> use GUN
[1:08:22] <Demon_chann> homo demons gotta be
[1:08:24] <%honeyman18> Big Circle
[1:08:25] <agumon9000> @AngriestPat Yeah, you are meant to go up the mountain to avoid all this dumb shit
[1:08:29] <%takiyami> Hang a apatBig right
[1:08:36] <corpsegoo> itt: the terrorists scan for life forms not cargo so they detect you way easier than mules
[1:08:38] <Mister_McDerp> do you guys think the brain is 21% of a person?
[1:08:38] <+ultimafullmetal> I murdered them and incinerated all 9 or so of their bodies.
[1:08:42] <%GeneralSCPatton> Cheer500 Oh my god, the bodybag in the water. I would just fucking die. My heart and soul would actually just give up and hit Alt F4 on life instead of enduring that hell.
[1:08:45] <%Meow0369> ONE GUY STRIKES AGAIN
[1:08:45] <%Divryne> YES.
[1:08:46] <agumon9000> Yes
[1:08:46] <%Valdorick> Bike-chan died for our sins.
[1:08:46] <wannabemoogle> Will the MULES try to steal Mama?
[1:08:46] <Demon_chann> yes
[1:08:46] <%marvel877> YES
[1:08:46] <%ArcanumMBD> THATS WRONG

[1:08:57] <%J_Papa> This way is fine
[1:08:58] <+robert_edwards> from Weather Station
[1:08:59] <corpsegoo> never scale the mountain before you have network
[1:09:00] <%Meow0369> You're going the right way chat is wrong
[1:09:02] <%marvel877> STRAIGHT LINE FROM MAMA'S PLACE TO DESTINATION.
[1:09:02] <%ArcanumMBD> You only go over the mountain after you get network coverage and cover it with ziplines
[1:09:06] <%Laecerelius> Could he even put down ziplines in the mountains yet?
[1:09:06] <%Divryne> You can go directly through the mountain valley from the Weather Station.
[1:09:08] <%Valdorick> GLASSES
[1:09:09] <BurningLlama777> Luckily Pat's got shielding on his back now so he'll be less likely to be shot.
[1:09:09] <D3rrtyD4n> GOOD JOB PAIGE
[1:09:10] <+ultimafullmetal> Your meant to do it any way you want actually.

[1:36:53] <herfaintsmile> @xtremegamer80 cage is so smug and pretentious i feel like kojima is more of a goof
[1:36:53] <%Doomcoder> I think the difference is that Kojima does stuff like this and then has already moved on before you've acclimated, whereas David Cage spends forever on the same dumb idea

[1:45:07] <KamiiFlow> atpSpiner
[1:45:07] <reonome> LUL
[1:45:07] <OldManDeckardCain> Norman Reedus: I'm straight. Kojima: I don't care
[1:45:07] <stukamod> This has to have been improv on Reedus part
[1:45:09] <%cureneckbeard> the shower has a drying function
[1:45:09] <+newbroxes> Personal-Spaceman
[1:45:10] <corpsegoo> 'if anyone asks, we fucked'

[1:45:21] <%SlimeSlimeSlime> Hahaha, what a bad excuse! XD
[1:45:23] <%vaporousTippler> Clearly, that was the least suspicious way to have that conversation.
[1:45:24] <%honeyman18> They saw you both in the Shower
[1:45:28] <%Diabetic> I mean.... it makes sense....so not to hear them...
[1:45:30] <%J_Papa> This is the most baffling scene since the last scene
[1:45:31] <zenith0111> REMEMBER 3 MOVIE DIRECTORS HELPED MAKE THIS
[1:45:33] <deviate_dv8> Would switching cuffs do anything?
[1:45:34] <+Punisher7771> so he dosent wash his clothes?
[1:45:35] <%GeneralSCPatton> Did he just swap the cuffs?
[1:45:36] <red_blaster> Pat is going to love this chapter. SO MANY ZIPLINE OPPORTUNITIES
[1:45:38] <herfaintsmile> this was just kojima's personal fantasy
[1:45:39] <%Laecerelius> Gotta deliver BB!
[1:45:41] <+terry_quest> do thing without the BB
[1:45:41] <Guardiansaiyan> @zenith0111 money WELL SPENT
[1:45:42] <HyperBomb21> YEP
[1:45:43] <42nfl19> @AngriestPat Reddus was only uncomfortable because he did not want to get touched I think. Not cause they were in the shower.
[1:45:44] <%dickbuttwoman> Those cuffs
[1:45:44] <%Doomcoder> BBline
[1:45:44] <agumon9000> YEP

[1:45:47] <%linSP> i love kojimas twists
[1:45:47] <%BallerSwagBro9k> That was EXTREMLY uncomfortable to watch
[1:45:48] <%Meow0369> this part of the game is so annoying
[1:45:48] <%marvel877> CLIMB THOSE MOUNTAINS.
[1:45:49] <D3rrtyD4n> i want my BB back moon2A
[1:45:50] <Droofasa> what does the BB do?
[1:45:50] <ne_zha> BT AREAS WITHOUT BB monkaS
[1:45:50] <dero45> Won’t they be curious why they shower together or is they cool with that in the future
[1:45:51] <corpsegoo> enjoy traveling through bt territory with no bb
[1:45:51] <%shootbang_exe> yeah this chapter sucks ass
[1:45:51] <superd4v3> @AngriestPat dah powah of kojumbo
[1:45:52] <+azure22900> lol

[1:45:54] <%Nope80808> all he is missing is the hat
[1:45:55] <%Jack_of_No_Trades> That was an homage to the shape of water
[1:45:56] <%Keyd00d> YEP
[1:45:57] <auspiciousdgg> And suddenly he's dry as a bone
[1:45:58] <fist_wizard_jay> S RANK YOUR BB

[1:46:03] <+Maldoree> I wont spoil anything but man this and the next chapter Pat is gonna LOVE
[1:46:05] <Sol_Install> i can't believe Kojima read a fan fic of Norman and Del Toro making out in a shower
[1:46:05] <%XeroSigmaPrime> @AngriestPat So Die-Hard Man now thinks Sam and Deadman had sex in a shower
[1:46:05] <+Mr_Pylon> So what does BB actually do?
[1:46:06] <%Meow0369> but with the cuffs it's easy
[1:46:07] <%arancet> dont factory reset my funky fetus
[1:46:09] <xiidrifty> This is the most annoying chapter in the game
[1:46:10] <+earthboy2k> This chapter fuckin blows
[1:46:11] <%ClericOfSparda> he looks so used after that shower
[1:46:11] <%Meow0369> The cuffs are so broken
[1:46:14] <cheesedburgers> This chapter sucks for obvious reasons
[1:46:14] <coracor> BibleThump
[1:46:15] <%Rumbutt> FUCK
[1:46:15] <%Diabetic> @auspiciousdgg Norman Reedus is never dry
[1:46:15] <mayorrev> he feels naked
[1:46:16] <%Doomcoder> this is like when you lose Boy in GoW
[1:46:16] <Crimpson> Feelsbad
[1:46:19] <%Sesshastings> I want my BB back ribs
[1:46:19] <ShichiNoBushi> Not really necessary. This chapter doesn't really force you through BT territory.
[1:46:20] <%deviljhojho_> disgostang
[1:46:20] <Sol_Install> super naked
[1:46:20] <+Malogor> oh didn't even realize pat was streaming damn... did i miss much?

[1:46:28] <%XeroSigmaPrime> ENJOY THE NEXT 10 HOURS OF HELL
[1:46:28] <Mendin> Wait does that mean you can equip a cargo item to your chest?
[1:46:31] <agumon9000> @AngriestPat So what were your thoughts on that wonderful cutscene with deadman?
[1:46:31] <emperor_z> Is the name "Lou" really dumb in the UK?
[1:46:31] <Guardiansaiyan> NAKED PORTER vs SOLID PORTER?
[1:46:31] <%TheMilhouseExperience> It’s fine you have a cuff shank.
[1:46:32] <%thenumber5point5> it's not that bad, I really liked this part, a lot more stealth and strategy focused
[1:46:33] <HyperBomb21> BTs aren't that bad guys, just use the gun!
[1:46:34] <Aydarkzero> i knew they were going to do this
[1:46:37] <%Laecerelius> He drank Monster before the cutscene
[1:46:38] <+Punisher7771> norman readus missed his fetus
[1:46:38] <reonome> no bb BibleThump
[1:46:41] <corpsegoo> just yell 'is my baby done yet' over the codec fifty times
[1:46:41] <%TDAWS_MP132> No ghosts

[1:47:01] <%Flambage> @AngriestPat Did you get the hidden preppers on the first map?
[1:47:03] <42nfl19> Can pat till fast travel?
[1:47:04] <cheesedburgers> Sam looks naked without the hat and glasses now
[1:47:06] <mayorrev> Bye yoko
[1:47:18] <%Laecerelius> Whoopsies!
[1:47:18] <%Jack_of_No_Trades> I hope you are ready to navigate all the way around any BT zone
[1:47:35] <%Strider222> just the container tho
[1:47:36] <%BurningLlama777> Just run through BT territory wildly swinging your cuffs around.
[1:47:40] <%neodeltai> Robot orders?
[1:47:42] <%GarbageNirvana> Fuckin Ludens fan
[1:47:43] <%xtremegamer80> There are preppers on the first map?
[1:47:44] <%sshen> @AngriestPat warframe update just dropped for rising tide
[1:47:45] <+netrac> can't you run across ?
[1:47:47] <mayorrev> @AngriestPat now that BB's gone can you put cargo on your chest?
[1:47:49] <+Mitchellsocks> Lmao, I watched the last two streams but missed all of the story and saw all of the road building
[1:47:52] <suikudo> !uptime
[1:47:54] <@Moobot> I've been playing this game for how long? Oh only 1h 47m.
[1:47:54] <zeif00> I put a fuck ton of zip lines here
[1:48:00] <rheviel> How many hours into this is Pat?
[1:48:00] <suikudo> have i missed any story?
[1:48:12] <%Jack_of_No_Trades> @sshen Saw the trailer. Is it out out, or just announced
[1:48:14] <%Laecerelius> You missed a lot of story if you just got in
[1:48:16] <+paladinstarbuster> just sonic through the BTs
[1:48:17] <TheDr0t> @mitchellsocks whole stream was road building
[1:48:18] <Zaphire_Saucypants> boned
[1:48:20] <zenith0111> @suikudo Hahahaha LUL a fair chunk
[1:48:20] <Habblewater> @suikudo you missed some shit
[1:48:21] <phatmac16> You missed the best cut scene
[1:48:23] <%Zamorouskiwhich> Such a lust for Ziplines...
[1:48:25] <%dekkitout> Well then make them count
[1:48:25] <startstoprepeat> @AngriestPat try doing the first person bb soothing
[1:48:28] <xiidrifty> If you don't have an easy way of getting around you're gonna need some extra boots
[1:48:31] <%TheMilhouseExperience> I actually did all grinding in this chapter. It was worth it not having BBS arm animation EVERY TIME.
[1:48:33] <ShichiNoBushi> I have found ziplines invaluable traversing the mountains.
[1:48:34] <%MalekDracarus> You are gonna want more...
[1:48:36] <suikudo> Well fuck guess ill watch later
[1:48:37] <emperor_z> Damn, Pat builds way more structures than me. Almost all of my chiral density is ziplines
[1:48:40] <%takiyami> You're about to add three preppers to the network. That won't be a problem soon.
[1:48:41] <+RayDaug> Hey guys, now that Woolies not on the internet anymore lets talk about how much he smells. No one can stop us
[1:48:42] <%ArcanumMBD> It's almost like dumping your entire bandwidth into ziplines in an area where you have a highway is a bad move
[1:48:42] <mayorrev> oh wait is there a thing for soothing BB without BB?
[1:48:45] <Demon_chann> @suikudo you missed some anime bullshit
[1:48:48] <corpsegoo> hit up the robotocist as soon as you can
[1:48:49] <%ArcanumMBD> NOPE
[1:48:52] <%thenumber5point5> you can remote disasimable items
[1:48:52] <%ArcanumMBD> NO FILTER ALLOWED
[1:48:54] <%Meow0369> I don't think so
[1:48:57] <%Divryne> NOPE.
[1:48:58] <%sshen> @Jack_of_No_Trades Just dropped, they red text and booted everyone to force updates. patch is 1.3gb
[1:49:01] <+Punisher7771> no
[1:49:03] <%Doomcoder> no filter, just like kojima's brain
[1:49:05] <corpsegoo> it'll make life in this area much easier
[1:49:06] <TonyPullMyDTRedgrave> if you disconnect from the online part of the game maybe?
[1:49:06] <%Divryne> Small indie company please forgive.
[1:49:07] <%Meow0369> You just gotta manually look
[1:49:14] <%TheMilhouseExperience> Pat you really should do the next 2 deliveries.
[1:49:17] <%thenumber5point5> the light blue stuff is yours I think
[1:49:19] <%Meow0369> that was your watchtwoer pat
[1:49:20] <+Mitchellsocks> What I've seen of Pat's stream: Everything through the beginning of chapter 3: Then no story from 4 or 5, except for the building of roads
[1:49:23] <zenith0111> Yours is Blue theirs is Green

[1:49:28] <%takiyami> Hold Triangle on the map to delete old structures
[1:49:29] <KasiCrafter> It'd make sense for the solution to be going offline, no?
[1:49:32] <%Jack_of_No_Trades> @sshen Good to know thanks! Was gonna play tonight with some friends, now I know I gotta allow some update time
[1:49:33] <%Meow0369> get rid of all that shit
[1:49:35] <%honeyman18> Kojima wants to bring everyone together not separate them, so theres no sorting or filters.
[1:49:37] <%Flambage> @AngriestPat delete any generators in front of major cities or distribution centers you placed to save bandwidth
[1:49:42] <%J_Papa> You'll get a ton of bandwidth when you get rep with shelters off stream

[1:49:56] <%ArcanumMBD> @KasiCrafter going offline doesn't remove the other stuff from your world. It would just stop new stuff from showing up
[1:50:04] <%XeroSigmaPrime> "DID YOU GUYS JUST FUCK?!"
[1:50:07] <%TheMilhouseExperience> Mistakes were made. Consequences were rendered. Life continues forward.

[1:50:29] <%BurningLlama777> If Higgs is so powerful why hasn't he just gone and killed everybody yet.
[1:50:30] <mikash91> his cadence change after the 'big reveal'?
[1:50:38] <KasiCrafter> @ArcanumMBD Well damn.
[1:50:39] <%XeroSigmaPrime> @munchkay Deadman and Same had sex, no joke
[1:50:40] <%BurningLlama777> He seems to have unlimited power.
[1:50:43] <corpsegoo> because higgs is a weenie nerd
[1:50:46] <%Keyd00d> because
[1:50:47] <%Meow0369> "a few"

[1:50:54] <%TheMilhouseExperience> Oh you scared! Die-hard-man!
[1:50:55] <Graxe_> So is this a hologram or a chiralgram?
[1:51:00] <Demon_chann> diehardman over his shoulder
[1:51:01] <jetvillain> @BurningLlama777 Kojima is not a good writer
[1:51:02] <Graxe_> What was the difference between them again?
[1:51:03] <reonome> yes

[1:51:16] <%LtSurge> "Sam, you just aren't YoloSwag enough do understand fully what we have to do "
[1:51:17] <astroPunkFunk> o no!
[1:51:21] <red_blaster> This is the zipline chapter
[1:51:21] <%XeroSigmaPrime> No such a thing as a hologram here, they're all chiralgrams
[1:51:25] <%Jack_of_No_Trades> I just realized... Did they mocap Guillermo crowding Norman? I wanna see behind the scenes
[1:51:34] <%TheMilhouseExperience> Lobotomize the baby.
[1:51:37] <+earthboy2k> This is the filler chapter
[1:51:41] <Psyramics> Main Objective: Do side content lol
[1:51:41] <TonyPullMyDTRedgrave> @XeroSigmaPrime he just said i hope you don't mind if we stick to holo though...
[1:51:43] <Mister_McDerp> we need to prepare it for instrumentality
[1:51:46] <ShichiNoBushi> Get the Roboticist first. You get a very useful tool from her for this area.
[1:51:50] <astroPunkFunk> just do everything, sam.
[1:51:51] <%goose_attack_almanac> Notice how that guys voice sounds less.... Gentle
[1:51:51] <%J_Papa> Del Toro didn't do the motion capture
[1:52:01] <corpsegoo> Robotocist will improve your life for this segemtn
[1:52:02] <%TheMilhouseExperience> No pat do the doctor. It’s worth it.
[1:52:02] <dekkitout> Privacy? lol wus dat
[1:52:07] <%nofestu2> tock by tick
[1:52:07] <%honeyman18> I want that BB to be 1000 feet tall and smash higs, then give a thumbs up.
[1:52:08] <zenith0111> You learn a LOT of lore from these upcoming preppers
[1:52:09] <42nfl19> so BEER AND PIZZA
[1:52:12] <+netrac> make privacy nuts join facebook
[1:52:16] <%Rlexp> bb noooooooo

[1:52:28] <katocrimson> rain? more like snow
[1:52:30] <%XeroSigmaPrime> @TonyPullMyDTRedgrave fuck idk know now...
[1:52:31] <%Zamorouskiwhich> And Higgs fight in 3... 2...\
[1:52:47] <42nfl19> @AngriestPat I guess you have to use the weather reports to avoid the rain more often now?
[1:52:48] <astroPunkFunk> is paige or emlo there?
[1:52:55] <%J_Papa> @Jack_of_No_Trades same with Nicolas Winding Refn as Heartman
[1:52:57] <%XeroSigmaPrime> @AngriestPat 5 STAR THESE NEXT PREPPPERS, they give the most important lore
[1:52:58] <TonyPullMyDTRedgrave> I think the static ones are holograms but the chiralgrams are the super detailed ones that sound clearer and poof in and out
[1:52:58] <%cureneckbeard> apatWink
[1:53:08] <%Jack_of_No_Trades> @J_Papa Perfectly reasonable, but disappointing. I expect weirder Mr Kojima
[1:53:21] <%GeneralSCPatton> Or just sprint through that shit with Speed Skeleton
[1:53:24] <%TheMilhouseExperience> Carry some axe spray. You’ll need it.

[1:53:44] <@Moobot> I've been playing this game for how long? Oh only 1h 53m.
[1:53:50] <+Yagerme> I have never used the weather reports

[1:53:56] <%BallerSwagBro9k> Ebola?
[1:53:57] <%thenumber5point5> ladders and climbing picks are needed heavily for this part
[1:54:01] <%nofestu2> Pat need ebola
[1:54:02] <%Strider222> you dont really need a bola gun
[1:54:05] <%Laecerelius> Need that ebola to nonletally take out those terrorists

[1:54:24] <+D00msDayDan> roboticist gives the last skeleton
[1:54:26] <red_blaster> >that heart on the map
[1:54:27] <%Divryne> Doctor is super close.
[1:54:29] <%honeyman18> Doctor Robotocist
[1:54:29] <%Meow0369> but doctor is super easy
[1:54:30] <%takiyami> Doctor is pretty easy too, but the Robot gives you a good piece of gear
[1:54:31] <Jolnir> @AngriestPat go to the doctor dirst ffs
[1:54:32] <%Strider222> doctor is super easy
[1:54:36] <%thenumber5point5> robo good but doctor is a fast safe run
[1:54:37] <The_Forgotten_Alligator> I wanna play this
[1:54:37] <KnightAsteran> doctor is right outside the door
[1:54:37] <+Felto3> dr is much easier
[1:54:37] <%Meow0369> Pat they're SO far apart
[1:54:39] <Demon_chann> @zettig but higgs is white
[1:54:39] <+JavaManJoJo> doctor is SO easy to get too, but robo gives a great item
[1:54:39] <cheesedburgers> Doctor WAY closer
[1:54:41] <%TheMilhouseExperience> Doctor is super worth it
[1:54:42] <%GarbageNirvana> You want what roboticist has for this
[1:54:46] <%Meow0369> Robo is so much harder to get to
[1:54:52] <red_blaster> BRING A MILLION ZIPLINES
[1:54:54] <+Yagerme> Doctor is easier
[1:54:55] <zenith0111> @j_papa Even more than a Rocket Launcher shot through a Custom Hemtaic Grenade?
[1:55:00] <astroPunkFunk> omg!! <3
[1:55:01] <%Zamorouskiwhich> <3
[1:55:02] <%Jack_of_No_Trades> I have no strong feelings one way or the other
[1:55:03] <%Divryne> GEE I WONDER WHY.
[1:55:06] <%Meow0369> How odd almost foreshadowing
[1:55:06] <ShichiNoBushi> I wonder who lives near the heart shaped lake...
[1:55:06] <+D00msDayDan> i wonder who lives there
[1:55:07] <agumon9000> <3
[1:55:09] <%BurningLlama777> Woof
[1:55:12] <ShichiNoBushi> Zoom in.
[1:55:14] <%takiyami> Zoom in
[1:55:14] <%Divryne> Arrows are winds.
[1:55:17] <%ArcanumMBD> if there's no arrow it means it's not going anywhere
[1:55:19] <%J_Papa> @zenith0111 oh i mean without combos like that, just a raw shot
[1:55:20] <%BallerSwagBro9k> OOPS ALL BTs
[1:55:26] <%TheMilhouseExperience> Weird who lives there?
[1:55:28] <%takiyami> Huh, weird
[1:55:29] <%Divryne> No arrow means forever.
[1:55:34] <Mister_McDerp> then theres no wind?
[1:55:34] <%Laecerelius> Maybe it's not moving. Maybe it's covered in BTs to fuck you over because no BB
[1:55:35] <%Divryne> It stay.
[1:55:40] <%linSP> Doctor upgrade is GREAT
[1:55:40] <emperor_z> I dont think that's what the arrows mean
[1:55:43] <cheesedburgers> “Stay out of the rain” he says as the whole region is constant snow
[1:55:45] <%TheMilhouseExperience> It’s constantly snowing.
[1:55:46] <%joylent_blue> the BTs LOVE the mountains
[1:55:46] <%GarbageNirvana> There's spots up here that are just forever ye
[1:55:49] <%Divryne> Arrows mean wind not where they go.
[1:55:52] <zenith0111> @j_papa Had to make sure
[1:55:59] <Mister_McDerp> I hope theres a blizzard
[1:56:00] <mayorrev> Wait was that mama's voidout
[1:56:17] <mayorrev> how did that get there
[1:56:18] <+Yagerme> How many stars ⭐️ you got on you leg.
[1:56:22] <%TheMilhouseExperience> The time fall snow is still active because it doesn’t melt.
[1:56:29] <%poohtrailsnailcooch> This was honestly my favorite part of the game
[1:56:31] <%honeyman18> What did happen to Mamma's body?
[1:56:40] <agumon9000> @AngriestPat Off stream making a massive Zipline network of the mountain is super woth it
[1:56:41] <Mendin> Wait do we have to burn Mama's corpse or is she technically already passed on due to weird soul fuckery
[1:56:43] <agumon9000> worth it
[1:56:57] <mayorrev> i think instead of burning her body they just let her voidout
[1:56:58] <%poohtrailsnailcooch> @honeyman18 Its with lockne still
[1:57:00] <%Meow0369> it's for real
[1:57:00] <%Divryne> Don't worry about Mama you nerds will find out soon enough.
[1:57:02] <%GeneralSCPatton> @angriestpat Can you still see and kill the catcher without BB to clear up the rain?
[1:57:04] <mayorrev> and it made a heart shaped voidout
[1:57:06] <%takiyami> It's a whole new zone
[1:57:07] <NotHereToStream> and it sucks donkey dick
[1:57:08] <%joylent_blue> scary place
[1:57:12] <%TheMilhouseExperience> This part was what made me hate this game, until I absolutely loved it.
[1:57:14] <zenith0111> @honeyman18 Good question. You'll get that answer soon enough if Pat focuses on story requirements
[1:57:15] <corpsegoo> you wish that was edgeknot
[1:57:18] <%honeyman18> Wait, she was dead, so maybe her body is just chillin' in her sisters room since they're one person again???
[1:57:26] <%Meow0369> You can sense when you enter an area because sam has dooms level 21
[1:57:27] <NotHereToStream> zipline will trivialize this area anyway
[1:57:28] <%Meow0369> 2*
[1:57:34] <%This_is_Marco> more like edge knut
[1:57:36] <%thenumber5point5> @mendin it will be dealt with later in story
[1:57:37] <+D00msDayDan> with bb gone you'll only see bts when they aggro
[1:57:37] <%takiyami> Do Doctor first, for sure
[1:57:37] <%Divryne> Mama's body will be explained later chill guys.
[1:57:38] <%Tucker0603> @angriestpat bring a bola gun
[1:57:40] <The_Forgotten_Alligator> The denzetsu no delivery man heads out
[1:57:42] <%poohtrailsnailcooch> @honeyman18 she mounted her
[1:57:42] <ShichiNoBushi> Sam can feel when BTs are near. You will get a warning whenyou enter their territory.
[1:57:45] <+D00msDayDan> but now you can fall and eat shit all you like
[1:57:47] <+Yagerme> ❄️
[1:57:51] <reonome> mama looks cool
[1:57:57] <%TheMilhouseExperience> Pat you really should do the doctor first.
[1:57:57] <OrangeMDT> eww
[1:57:57] <%reddpop_> you're 0,1,2 grenades can help find out where bts are (or aren't)
[1:57:57] <%Laecerelius> Hey, it's the upgrade!
[1:57:58] <%SGrim> codec, more like co-dead LuL
[1:57:59] <Mendin> Mama 2.0
[1:57:59] <%Doomcoder> @Divryne can you not??? speculating is part of the fun
[1:58:00] <Demon_chann> god she so much hotter that mama
[1:58:00] <SoySocks> is that how voices always sound over the calls, or are their voices layered?
[1:58:01] <%Meow0369> That's so fucking weird

[1:58:35] <%Jack_of_No_Trades> Boy I missed something nuts Im guessing. Stupid work, paying my bills in exchange for not seeing the stream
[1:58:36] <%SlimeSlimeSlime> I think THIS is what they want to do to make America "whole".
[1:58:37] <TheDr0t> can you see BT in bola aim laser?
[1:58:38] <%J_Papa> Ok straight line up the mountain here we go

[1:58:40] <%TheMilhouseExperience> Kingdom Hearts?
[1:58:41] <%FrostMass22> Is this game some kind of propaganda piece?
[1:58:41] <%nofestu2> We are many We are one
[1:58:44] <+JavaManJoJo> I super wouldn't want to share bodies with my sibling

[2:00:08] <%reddpop_> its about time for a new ssx tbh
[2:00:13] <mayorrev> Is there anything more satisfying than the crunch of snow?
[2:00:18] <%joylent_blue> ShockzNDrawe you just missed apatBig spoiler then LUL
[2:00:23] <%Doomcoder> @ShockzNDrawe yeah this chat is in dire need of a mod to squelch spoilers
[2:00:23] <%poohtrailsnailcooch> I made one down at the bottom but it doesnt show in your game
[2:00:26] <corpsegoo> and this is why you need the roboticist first
[2:00:31] <The_Forgotten_Alligator> why am I so interested in this game lol
[2:00:31] <astroPunkFunk> u can do it patman
[2:00:31] <Ultimatefool> So what part of America is this snow world
[2:00:31] <agumon9000> @AngriestPat When it comes to online ziplines, you could make like 10 of them but only 3 will spawn in someone elses world
[2:00:34] <%marvel877> Maybe their zipline connects to someone elses zipline in their game?
[2:00:36] <%Ner234> BOTH WAYS! Through TEN FEET of SNOW!
[2:00:37] <HoldBtoRun> @BallerSwagBro9k for real tho, the monsters are super bad, but people just telling you it's fine, just accept it, is horrifying
[2:00:37] <%Floorislava> mountain zone is easy it just takes forever wihtout laying down ziplines
[2:00:38] <mayorrev> paige are you alive
[2:00:38] <$HyperionXV> I spy a rainbow
[2:00:43] <%TheMilhouseExperience> @shockzndrawe don’t worry no real spoilers until Sam gets bb back.
[2:00:47] <superd4v3> @Ultimatefool Rocky Mountains
[2:00:47] <%Conyst> Gonna laugh if an update comes out next year and this is a prequel to dead space
[2:00:48] <OrangeMDT> balboa
[2:00:51] <+rareqq> you got a lot of bandwidth when you joined mountain knot city
[2:00:52] <Mister_McDerp> looks like the rockies
[2:00:53] <agumon9000> ???
[2:00:54] <%Rumbutt> This is where I am right now, more or less, and it SUCKS
[2:00:57] <%Animorphimagi> you should go to the roboticist first
[2:00:57] <%poohtrailsnailcooch> you will se why
[2:01:00] <%IllusiveFish> hear all that snow ASMR apatSmug
[2:01:01] <%marvel877> Is that the skate park?
[2:01:01] <carbon458> Appalachia
[2:01:01] <+Yagerme> Did you map it out
[2:01:01] <%J_Papa> Sometimes people use bridges as timefall shelters for trucks
[2:01:03] <+zombibyte_> bridges be crazy
[2:01:05] <@ShockzNDrawe> hey no screaming spoilers in chat you goblins
[2:01:07] <mayorrev> Can you get a snowmobile?
[2:01:08] <%BurningLlama777> Oh hey a bandit fort
[2:01:08] <%thenumber5point5> pat I know I way to make the mountain climbing easier in a emergency
[2:01:09] <Crimpson> Don't be judging
[2:01:11] <SpaceGuntank> why is that rock oddly square-ish?
[2:01:11] <@ShockzNDrawe> there I did a mod
[2:01:12] <emperor_z> This area feels SO GOOD to zipline the hell out of
[2:01:13] <%tweedler92> Really hoped on Wyoming being a volcanic hellscape but oh well
[2:01:15] <zenith0111> Probably for vehicles since they're the worst things in videogame history to drive up slopes
[2:01:16] <%poohtrailsnailcooch> Bridges also conserve power
[2:01:18] <mayorrev> Could your bike manage this snow?
[2:01:20] <%BurningLlama777> You can probably get some potions and septims and stuff.
[2:01:25] <%Doomcoder> applauds ShockzNDrawe

[2:03:50] <phatmac16> E rank luck
[2:03:50] <Crimpson> I find it odd that they show animals in this world at the start of the game, but you never see one while walking around.
[2:03:51] <corpsegoo> I just set them off and killed the catcher so I didn't have to deal with the BT shit
[2:03:51] <%reddpop_> number 0 1 2 grenades help

[2:04:41] <Graxe_> I though handprints only show up once they find you?
[2:04:41] <KnightAsteran> @angriestpat stay on the ridges, BTS seem to live in the dips/valleys
[2:04:41] <42nfl19> @AngriestPat Reedus is still BT sensitive, so you still might be able to do something
[2:04:43] <Crimpson> You still have DOOMS that make you feel when a BT is around

[2:05:42] <%Divryne> You don't get outlines without BB.
[2:05:44] <%XeroSigmaPrime> nope
[2:05:44] <%FrostMass22> You don't need to worry about BTs, just use your blood grenades
[2:05:44] <%PkSilent01> Oh thank you @poohtrailsnailcooch for the gift sub
[2:05:48] <+D00msDayDan> without bb you can't see bts until it's too late

[2:05:59] <HoIlywood_SN> @AngriestPat DO IT YOU BIG MASSIVE COWARD
[2:06:01] <%StaceMcGate> We need more Ziplines

[2:12:31] <%joylent_blue> grinding for materials yeah
[2:12:31] <%Animorphimagi> you could be snow boarding RIGHT NOW
[2:12:37] <zenith0111> @mayorrev No
[2:12:40] <mayorrev> No?
[2:12:40] <%ChaosAethr> BB is the Radar
[2:12:43] <corpsegoo> only as much grinding as you want to do
[2:12:44] <%thenumber5point5> well still see packages and world info
[2:12:44] <+silvery_cricket> This snow effect is really good
[2:12:46] <%Keyd00d> no
[2:12:52] <mayorrev> what else can it do, the terrain scan?
[2:12:53] <corpsegoo> it's possible to run only the story stuff
[2:12:54] <%Jack_of_No_Trades> I now want this game just to use the floating handtruck to snowboard
[2:12:56] <%rumtumtugnutz> dang. mingus reedus IS pretty
[2:13:03] <ShichiNoBushi> Robotnik
[2:13:04] <emperor_z> The item you get from connecting her is great
[2:13:05] <CanadianAnimatorGuy> Freezing To Death With Norman Reedus: Only on AMC
[2:13:10] <%Doomcoder> this game is gonna convince lots of people to upgrade to a Pro
[2:13:15] <Mister_McDerp> because she annoyed you
[2:13:18] <corpsegoo> she makes it worth your while
[2:13:22] <Magmalefilme> You can find bt by poiting a granate
[2:13:24] <%TheMilhouseExperience> Pat stop at the hot spring.
[2:13:26] <corpsegoo> unlike most arseholes
[2:13:26] <%radda343> you havent even seen the worst of it
[2:13:33] <%BurningLlama777> I like how these proud independent preppers go and hole up in the middle of nowhere and then demand that people deliver them stuff.
[2:13:34] <%This_is_Marco> @mayorrev terrain scan and loot scan
[2:13:37] <mayorrev> ahh ok
[2:13:42] <zenith0111> @mayorrev BB for normies makes the scanner work. But since Sam has DOOMS it already does that. BB just enchances his already inherent abilities to see BTs
[2:13:42] <bahamut1010> Skip cutcences The Game
[2:13:43] <mayorrev> who could this be now?
[2:13:44] <%Bane_Kaikyo> Lady confirmed!!
[2:13:44] <%J_Papa> and Human scan
[2:13:47] <%joylent_blue> ain't no one convincing me of getting a pro a year-ish out from ps5
[2:13:55] <%radda343> you can deliver lost cargo at the same time as orders
[2:13:56] <%GeneralSCPatton> He fucking knew!
[2:13:56] <mayorrev> ohhhh i see
[2:13:58] <Mister_McDerp> how did he know?
[2:14:00] <%rumtumtugnutz> nothing will make me consider buying a playstation pro.
[2:14:02] <@SSaryn> HEY. Whaddaya doing in here.
[2:14:02] <Demon_chann> ye
[2:14:06] <%Doomcoder> hahahahaha all these independent preppers are just instantly like "UCA! <3"
[2:14:20] <%This_is_Marco> Deliver me my underwear Ill be at the top of this tall ass mountain
[2:14:22] <astroPunkFunk> normal looks like shite
[2:14:23] <Mendin> Mingus is the son of Norman + A Supermodel so yeah he got some attractive genes
[2:14:24] <%StaceMcGate> Is Stadia only runnable on the chiral network?
[2:14:26] <%TheMilhouseExperience> And her child.
[2:14:27] <astroPunkFunk> norman!!!
[2:14:31] <ShichiNoBushi> They tell you how apprehensive everyone is out here, but all of them are pretty easy to win over.
[2:14:32] <Kalinflip> lil mangus
[2:14:35] <%GeneralSCPatton> She wants to invent something called a Metal... Gear?
[2:14:35] <Demon_chann> i mean you literally get internet if you do @Doomcoder
[2:14:37] <mayorrev> did elmo do a cute thing?
[2:14:38] <%joylent_blue> someone in chat referred to her as the robot lady, so that's probably how pat knew
[2:14:39] <%ChaosAethr> I mean i think were causing a big problem longer term but ok
[2:14:40] <%Bane_Kaikyo> Belmo<3
[2:14:40] <Mendin> The chiral network might actually have negative latency
[2:14:44] <Kalinflip> @Demon_chann RIGHT!
[2:14:44] <%thenumber5point5> @doomcoder trust me there are some that are a straight bitch to work with
[2:14:46] <%rumtumtugnutz> Stadia runs on SkyNet
[2:14:52] <Kalinflip> lol imagine all the porn starved people
[2:14:53] <emperor_z> That skeleton is GREAT
[2:14:53] <%BurningLlama777> Oooh
[2:14:54] <wannabemoogle> oooooooooo
[2:14:55] <%Floorislava> yeah yeah yeah
[2:14:56] <HoldBtoRun> oooooooh
[2:14:57] <+SkaiVibration> !!!
[2:14:57] <%Laecerelius> NEW SKELETON!
[2:14:57] <HoIlywood_SN> Stadia would still run like shit even on the Chiral Network because the Sadia box would spontaneously combust into flame and detonate like a fragmentation grenade in your living room, killing you instantly
[2:14:57] <%neodeltai> Google would still find a way to make Stadia suck on the chiral network.
[2:14:58] <ShichiNoBushi> Vital for this area.
[2:14:58] <corpsegoo> that is why you do this first
[2:14:58] <%Divryne> SLAP THAT SHIT ON.
[2:14:59] <%Jack_of_No_Trades> All terrain venomoth
[2:15:00] <%Ner234> A T S
[2:15:00] <Demon_chann> YEAH this skeleton rocks
[2:15:00] <Mendin> Gold That Skellington
[2:15:00] <SpaceGuntank> YE YE YE
[2:15:01] <+LtSergei> I LOVE GOOOOOLD
[2:15:02] <Nineball_Luce> Gold, you say?
[2:15:02] <%Alpha8087> Eyyy what up Pat and Paige, sorry im late!
[2:15:03] <mayorrev> Best Skeleton?
[2:15:03] <Kalinflip> @rumtumtugnutz #stawoke
[2:15:03] <%XeroSigmaPrime> LITERALLY THE BEST SKELETON IN THE GAME
[2:15:03] <zenith0111> THE BEST FOR THE MOUNTAINS
[2:15:05] <%kyuubisonic> its the best one
[2:15:05] <emperor_z> I 5-starred her ASAP
[2:15:07] <42nfl19> DOES ALL TERRAIN MEAN WATER ALSO????
[2:15:07] <%Tucker0603> GET THAT SHIT
[2:15:08] <%thenumber5point5> yep last one you will ever need
[2:15:10] <katocrimson> level her up
[2:15:12] <Kalinflip> @42nfl19 yes
[2:15:13] <zenith0111> @42nfl19 YEE
[2:15:14] <%Doomcoder> I really hope this is a parkour skeleton
[2:15:15] <%Animorphimagi> NOW E'RE IN THE ENDGAME
[2:15:17] <Jolnir> the doctors is literally right ouside the door of the city
[2:15:18] <%joylent_blue> "we didn't model that shit"
[2:15:27] <Kalinflip> and steep hills
[2:15:32] <cheesedburgers> This section is now playable but still Bad
[2:15:35] <%TheMilhouseExperience> This is the “vertical” skeleton.
[2:15:35] <%StaceMcGate> chirals level increasing, as well as Mads Mikkelson levels
[2:15:37] <%deviljhojho_> Oh bother
[2:15:37] <mayorrev> BB-28 is BB-8's cousin
[2:15:43] <Mendin> BB... does not look good
[2:15:44] <%J_Papa> Do Sam's balls shrink in the cold?
[2:15:47] <alrobot2014> does this mean you can walk on water band become norman jesus?
[2:15:52] <zenith0111> @jolnir It's so baffling but his backstory is that he left so it sort of makes sense but not really
[2:15:53] <reonome> inb4 he just replaced your bb with a new one
[2:15:54] <%cureneckbeard> BB-70-Fuck
[2:15:57] <%ChaosAethr> @AngriestPat Again Isnt that Bad
[2:15:58] <%GeneralSCPatton> LOBOTOBB
[2:16:00] <%Jack_of_No_Trades> Did you make regular delivery
[2:16:01] <Kalinflip> all teriian is godlike
[2:16:03] <%Floorislava> goody weight limit :(
[2:16:06] <%Doomcoder> @J_Papa they're probably protected by DOOMs
[2:16:07] <mayorrev> Isn't this a perfect reward for climbing a mountain?
[2:16:08] <%Floorislava> goodbye*
[2:16:08] <%GarbageNirvana> Pump your baby fulla drugs
[2:16:10] <%Alpha8087> Paige should get a Power Skeleton
[2:16:12] <OrangeMDT> is the drug just poison so the BB stays in limbo?
[2:16:13] <ranarath> @J_Papa probably
[2:16:20] <%TheMilhouseExperience> Lobototoddler
[2:16:21] <%joylent_blue> emlo being a shit
[2:16:22] <Zaphire_Saucypants> His backstory is pretty fucked
[2:16:24] <+dualviper25> Agreed bb needs to inject the weeds
[2:16:31] <Mendin> Ayyyy Level 2
[2:16:33] <%Laecerelius> Already got level 2!
[2:16:34] <zenith0111> LVL 2
[2:16:43] <%TheMilhouseExperience> Pat head to the hot spring.
[2:16:45] <%Doomcoder> BB stands for Buttchugging Beer
[2:16:46] <corpsegoo> I mean technically a lot of drugs are just carefully applied poisons
[2:16:55] <Demon_chann> yeah but sam is a weirdo
[2:16:55] <+netrac> Sam literally can
[2:17:01] <blackesteagle> Ken levine do it?
[2:17:06] <ShichiNoBushi> Gave you schematic. You have to make one.
[2:17:07] <mayorrev> What's that huge square package on your back?
[2:17:09] <%TDAWS_MP132> sam cannot without his bb
[2:17:18] <cheesedburgers> Lady do you have any idea how many roads he’s built
[2:17:23] <mayorrev> THEYRE THE SAME
[2:17:26] <reonome> whats the difference
[2:17:28] <%deviljhojho_> intedrasting
[2:17:29] <%Doomcoder> that's really cool
[2:17:30] <Mister_McDerp> nuh uh
[2:17:30] <+SkaiVibration> ...
[2:17:31] <%reddpop_> they're the same now
[2:17:31] <Mendin> They are One now
[2:17:32] <%Floorislava> oh god i never noticed
[2:17:33] <%Doomcoder> Pat did a smart
[2:17:33] <%aishman> You have level 2?
[2:17:34] <Hellarussian> do they use Brawno to water their crops in this game?
[2:17:35] <Demon_chann> oh wow i didnt notice
[2:17:35] <%medusasghost> weird
[2:17:36] <Lelfro> Pat knows his Mothers
[2:17:38] <ne_zha> Malingen and Lockne are the same
[2:17:39] <%cureneckbeard> Sam's ringtone is London Bridge is Falling Down
[2:17:39] <+SkaiVibration> it's lockne's body tho.....
[2:17:40] <CanadianAnimatorGuy> they're the same now lol
[2:17:40] <%Animorphimagi> SAME PERSON
[2:17:41] <+NitronStreams> Mama2.0
[2:17:42] <Mister_McDerp> they're the same person apparently
[2:17:44] <%deviljhojho_> MAKE US WHOLE ISAM
[2:17:47] <%TheMilhouseExperience> And you can carry on your load bearing hips again.
[2:17:48] <%thenumber5point5> also two different voice tones
[2:17:48] <%GarbageNirvana> Not the mama
[2:17:48] <Mister_McDerp> ISAAC
[2:17:49] <%Laecerelius> UPGRADED MAMA!
[2:17:51] <%Jack_of_No_Trades> But they are the same. Like when a character spawns in another character in Skyrim
[2:17:52] <Mendin> Hey Peach have you seen Mingus?
[2:17:53] <%marvel877> Less drain on stamina, can't carry as much as the power skeleton.
[2:17:54] <katocrimson> u can now do shortcut down to weather statiom
[2:17:55] <%TDAWS_MP132> they call from different phones Kappa
[2:17:56] <Nina96> no paige
[2:17:58] <%neodeltai> MAKE US WHOLE
[2:18:00] <%cureneckbeard> gold skeleton is paige's favourite things
[2:18:00] <ShichiNoBushi> Doesn't take up leg slots.
[2:18:02] <Mister_McDerp> THE MARKER
[2:18:04] <zenith0111> 1/2 + 1/2 = Locma
[2:18:12] <+LtSergei> i wonder who lives by that heart shaped lake
[2:18:15] <%kyuubisonic> it is
[2:18:15] <%XeroSigmaPrime> IT WORKSON SNOW SLOPES AND ROCKS
[2:18:16] <HyperBomb21> meh
[2:18:19] <HyperBomb21> Speed Skelly is still good
[2:18:20] <%StaceMcGate> all terrain venomoth
[2:18:25] <Graxe_> Was that a hologram child?
[2:18:26] <%linSP> who's hole?
[2:18:31] <%kyuubisonic> sprint prevents bright blue stamina from going down
[2:18:32] <%thenumber5point5> and you get your hip storage back
[2:18:34] <+D00msDayDan> i still think speed skeleon is the best out of the snow because of the super jump
[2:18:34] <%TheMilhouseExperience> You can also carry on your hips.
[2:18:35] <%marvel877> You can't carry as much as the Power one, though, Pat.
[2:18:37] <%XeroSigmaPrime> You can now walk up nearly vertical slopes
[2:18:44] <NotHereToStream> hot spring nearby
[2:18:44] <cheesedburgers> There’s a reason why it’s so late
[2:18:45] <42nfl19> @AngriestPat will you try the all terrain in the water?
[2:18:48] <Mendin> Got them hips
[2:18:52] <agumon9000> @AngriestPat Yeah that is how you get to Mountain Knot City through the mountains. Via the weather station
[2:19:05] <wannabemoogle> Santa?
[2:19:06] <SpaceGuntank> SANTA?
[2:19:13] <%Doomcoder> shit let's be santa
[2:19:16] <wannabemoogle> Krampus?
[2:19:17] <Demon_chann> @AngriestPat hey has your sleep gotten better?
[2:19:19] <+D00msDayDan> santa's gonna make you deliver presents for him
[2:19:20] <Mister_McDerp> santa is a BT now
[2:19:22] <FackinCrazy> Honestly the speed one is mostly useless with bikes and trucks
[2:19:22] <%vaporousTippler> What if this entire game is just an origin story for how Sam becomes Santa?
[2:19:23] <cheesedburgers> Sam be looking like the end of The Shining
[2:19:23] <zenith0111> Stranding Sam Stranding Sam Stranding USA rmzSLAIN
[2:19:24] <%TheMilhouseExperience> Follow the path straight
[2:19:27] <corpsegoo> I think The First Prepper can give you a santa hat
[2:19:30] <%Alpha8087> I wish that made Die-Hardman's theme just the theme to Die Hard
[2:19:31] <ranarath> Santa confirmed real in Death Stranding UCA.
[2:19:46] <%Bane_Kaikyo> @agumon9000 He went around entirely... so he already went to mountain knot and stuff
[2:19:46] <Mendin> Saint Nicholas, patron of porters
[2:19:50] <Zaphire_Saucypants> @corpsegoo he does
[2:19:55] <%TheMilhouseExperience> Turn right
[2:19:56] <corpsegoo> kewl
[2:20:05] <+D00msDayDan> hot spring to the east, and a shortcut to the weather station
[2:20:10] <%StaceMcGate> Santa delivers cum and pizza to all the good boys and girls
[2:20:21] <%GarbageNirvana> Samta
[2:20:24] <zenith0111> @alpha8087 Kojima so would
[2:20:26] <%l3sovikk> That lake is a heart
[2:20:32] <+D00msDayDan> where the hot spring signs are
[2:20:34] <%StaceMcGate> aboot
[2:20:34] <startstoprepeat> i think it might be where all those hot spring signs are
[2:20:36] <%TDAWS_MP132> down left
[2:20:37] <%takiyami> Of current location
[2:20:38] <%Divryne> Next to Doctor.
[2:20:39] <katocrimson> look at the sign
[2:20:39] <%Jack_of_No_Trades> Yes I do wear a boot
[2:20:40] <wannabemoogle> OMG Sam is Santa now it all makes sense
[2:20:41] <ShichiNoBushi> Due east of Roboticist.
[2:20:41] <%J_Papa> There's a million signs for hot spring
[2:20:42] <+JavaManJoJo> where all those hot spring markers are Pat
[2:20:43] <+dualviper25> Samta needs to fill my stocking full of cummies
[2:20:43] <%TheMilhouseExperience> Head back down
[2:20:47] <+robert_edwards> blind
[2:20:47] <+D00msDayDan> southeast
[2:20:49] <%tweedler92> Yellowstone?
[2:20:50] <corpsegoo> just maybe
[2:20:50] <%thenumber5point5> see those 4 heat markers on the map
[2:20:51] <zenith0111> There's one close to where you are now.
[2:20:53] <%Alpha8087> A SCREAM
[2:20:55] <%Bane_Kaikyo> 1
[2:20:56] <%WackyGear> elmo rosr
[2:20:59] <%joylent_blue> apatElmo
[2:21:01] <%neodeltai> Just right of robotinist
[2:21:07] <mistertrashman> it really is
[2:21:08] <%poohtrailsnailcooch> wooot wooot
[2:21:13] <%joylent_blue> i did :)
[2:21:15] <%Explodincatz> big boy steps
[2:21:17] <mayorrev> look at him cronch that snow
[2:21:22] <%shootbang_exe> you should try and get to mountaineer after doctor @AngriestPat
[2:21:23] <%Animorphimagi> everyone
[2:21:23] <mayorrev> ONSEN
[2:21:25] <%This_is_Marco> no I did it :)
[2:21:26] <%BurningLlama777> That's the walk of a professional there
[2:21:26] <cheesedburgers> Literally no reason to ever take them off
[2:21:29] <mayorrev> ???
[2:21:30] <%SlimeSlimeSlime> Forbidden
[2:21:31] <%XeroSigmaPrime> SNOW
[2:21:31] <Demon_chann> why is it blue
[2:21:32] <The_Forgotten_Alligator> I did too :)
[2:21:33] <%kyuubisonic> cause its.snowing
[2:21:33] <ianabstract> time snow
[2:21:33] <lethallylactic> Stanky streamer
[2:21:34] <%XeroSigmaPrime> TIMEFALL SNOW
[2:21:35] <+dualviper25> Cause its snowing?
[2:21:35] <%aishman> CAUSE OF THE SNOW
[2:21:35] <mayorrev> WHY NOT
[2:21:36] <agumon9000> Its raining
[2:21:36] <%Divryne> Snow.
[2:21:37] <%zv1neda> time snow
[2:21:38] <%TDAWS_MP132> timefall snow
[2:21:39] <%GeneralSCPatton> TIME SNOW
[2:21:39] <%aishman> Timefall dude
[2:21:40] <%CrabSlacks> the time snow
[2:21:40] <zenith0111> GET NAKED IN THE SNOW
[2:21:41] <%takiyami> Because its snowing
[2:21:42] <%Laecerelius> Yeah it's snowing so you'll get timefall'd
[2:21:42] <corpsegoo> I love how sam walks in snow like a dog with shoes
[2:21:42] <%Jack_of_No_Trades> Bad idea in timefall
[2:21:43] <%TheMilhouseExperience> Everybody but me, but okay
[2:21:43] <ShichiNoBushi> Can't get naked in the snow.
[2:21:44] <mayorrev> snowfall?
[2:21:46] <%thenumber5point5> odd
[2:21:46] <%J_Papa> You'll shrivel
[2:21:47] <%Divryne> SUCKS TO BE YOU.
[2:21:50] <startstoprepeat> you still get the benefits just from standing in it though
[2:21:53] <mistertrashman> you can still just stand in it
[2:21:53] <mikash91> too bummed out to bath without BB?
[2:21:56] <FutaSnek> Sam MUST HAVE a stinky penis
[2:21:57] <cheesedburgers> Still timefalling
[2:21:57] <The_Forgotten_Alligator> owned property
[2:21:57] <%StaceMcGate> no hot springs episode then
[2:21:58] <ne_zha> No it's because Sam has Tatoos
[2:22:01] <FackinCrazy> its honestly kinda op because you can just walk everywhere in a straight line
[2:22:03] <Mister_McDerp> timesnow sounds so stupid I love it
[2:22:03] <mayorrev> What's this music?
[2:22:03] <42nfl19> @AngriestPat Could you possible build a timefall shelter to cover the hotspring?
[2:22:04] <blackesteagle> what is time stone
[2:22:06] <%XeroSigmaPrime> You can just stand in the spring for benefits tho
[2:22:11] <%TheMilhouseExperience> No you can totally use it later
[2:22:14] <%aishman> It's literally straight ahead
[2:22:21] <%Strider222> time fart
[2:22:24] <+cereal_box_conspiracy> Timesnow? So it's the water that is timey-wobbly? Is there time vapor and time-ice?
[2:22:26] <ShichiNoBushi> Go into compass mode (L1) and press left and right to cycle through points of interest.
[2:22:28] <%Explodincatz> elevation wise?
[2:22:29] <%WhereIsWill> wait what happened to BB? I was gone
[2:22:29] <%Jack_of_No_Trades> If it were just regular snow, I can't recommend hot body of water enough. Used to go in hot tub when snowing hard, was great
[2:22:35] <deviate_dv8> you could build a timefall shellter and then bath, right?
[2:22:39] <%CrabSlacks> you would be fine in the spring if you just stayed submerged up to your head while wearing a sombrero
[2:22:39] <zenith0111> @fackincrazy That's why it's the last one you get
[2:22:43] <%thenumber5point5> top of peaks
[2:22:47] <%aishman> Oh I getcha, yeah but only thing to do is just GO AND TRUST
[2:22:47] <HoIlywood_SN> @AngriestPat wait so is the ocean ecosystem totally fine? because timefall turns into normal water when it hits something o everything under the sea should be totally fine, and animals dont cause BTs or Void outs so theres no risk of that, so the ocean should be totally normal besides whales getting fucked sometimes right?
[2:22:51] <%lotharrio> No roads. Who cares.
[2:22:55] <%Alpha8087> Man they missed an opportunity to have timeshow actually freeze things in time
[2:22:58] <%GeneralSCPatton> @42nfl19 Oh, I just realized, the shelter has a heater, not because of a temperature management mechanic, but to stop time snow
[2:22:58] <mayorrev> My undies!
[2:23:01] <+dualviper25> @cereal_box_conspiracy i think its has more to do with downward momentum that the time just clings to the rain/snow
[2:23:02] <ShichiNoBushi> Thermal underwear?
[2:23:05] <FutaSnek> @WhereIsWill Too much stress and connection to sam, had to seperate the two to bring to back "Closer to the other side"
[2:23:07] <%joylent_blue> cool
[2:23:08] <%linSP> i got a lucky zipline to spawn with 15k upvotes, its the perfect spot
[2:23:09] <HoIlywood_SN> how the fuc kdid that happen
[2:23:10] <+robert_edwards> hold l1 and use the d pad left and right. @angriestpat
[2:23:11] <Mister_McDerp> nah its fine
[2:23:11] <%TheMilhouseExperience> Your bandwidth is kinda fucked right now.
[2:23:11] <mayorrev> Can you build roads up here?
[2:23:12] <%J_Papa> Pat we're in the center of America, that wasn't the ocean
[2:23:14] <Demon_chann> yeah is ghost tar
[2:23:15] <+netrac> It would be amazing if the rest of the world was fine
[2:23:16] <%Laecerelius> It's not great
[2:23:18] <ShichiNoBushi> With floating blob monsters.
[2:23:22] <Mister_McDerp> fish love tar
[2:23:22] <Mendin> Lot of dead whales and ghost jellyfish
[2:23:23] <%Doomcoder> the tar is the thing that makes the least sense to me
[2:23:24] <%aishman> NEW ORDER?!
[2:23:28] <@commanderclaw> This is some evangelion levels of fucked
[2:23:32] <HoIlywood_SN> how did the entire ocean become tar
[2:23:33] <%WhereIsWill> gotcha ty!
[2:23:36] <%StaceMcGate> @AngriestPat Is Mexico and Canada just gone entirely?
[2:23:40] <KnightAsteran> @doomcoder it's hell juice
[2:23:42] <%Jack_of_No_Trades> I can see 1000s of years of runoff accelerated into just a few being bad for the coasts
[2:23:42] <TheDr0t> @angriestpat I can't believe Clifford yeeted your BB into volcano and he dieded
[2:23:44] <%TheMilhouseExperience> Shits fucked: the briefing.
[2:23:46] <Mendin> @Doomcoder think about it. What does lots of dead stuff + long long amounts of time equal?
[2:23:49] <zenith0111> @hoilywood_sn Depends which area you look at but besides the BTs and Timefall there have been pools of infinite tar growing out of no where
[2:23:49] <%aishman> Pat did you check if the new order was for the doctor dude?
[2:23:57] <%Jack_of_No_Trades> were they ever really here?
[2:24:02] <%takiyami> Every country in the world belongs to America
[2:24:05] <%joylent_blue> the answer to that is: no one apparently cares :)
[2:24:07] <Mister_McDerp> only the ruins of america are left
[2:24:07] <+dualviper25> ohh theory maybe america was just shot into its own timespace
[2:24:11] <corpsegoo> basically no one can travel far enough to check on other countries, even those on the same land mass
[2:24:12] <%Doomcoder> @Mendin right, that was what I assumed. but it comes up indoors and out of nowhere
[2:24:17] <blackesteagle> but is it really safe?
[2:24:19] <zenith0111> @hoilywood_sn You can see fish in the river tho so there is some healthy fish life
[2:24:22] <%Maids4lyfe> canada isn't real and you can't prove otherwise
[2:24:22] <%XeroSigmaPrime> Dumbies, Mexico and Canda were never even real, theyre just hoaxes
[2:24:24] <Mister_McDerp> delete it then
[2:24:26] <%aishman> Make your own!
[2:24:27] <%ChaosAethr> @AngriestPat Quick question I heard that Timefall destroys anything build that get caught in the rain, if so what the point of building anything if it gets destroyed in the end?
[2:24:28] <ne_zha> online ziplines are terrible on my server as well :D
[2:24:29] <%takiyami> It's a junction, because of the 300 meter limit
[2:24:33] <agumon9000> @AngriestPat You only got one of probably a series of them
[2:24:38] <%Maids4lyfe> LUL
[2:24:38] <phoenix032797> Where is the place to put money to get a lap dance from pat?
[2:24:43] <%GeneralSCPatton> @chaosaethr Can be repaired
[2:24:47] <%Doomcoder> @ChaosAethr damage is v. slow, r epairing is v. fast
[2:24:50] <The_Forgotten_Alligator> 190 iq player
[2:24:55] <startstoprepeat> it's dumb, the online system only pulls in a few from each person so you never get a whole network and they just get in the way of building your own
[2:24:58] <akita_opal> We all about M'erica here!
[2:24:58] <%TheMilhouseExperience> Just follow the chasm. Doctors order is fucked right now.
[2:24:59] <+zombibyte_> make a strand contract and get the rest
[2:25:02] <%StaceMcGate> Testicle Lake over there
[2:25:03] <%Divryne> @AngriestPat I had a fucker place a zipline right in the middle of some BTs and I got caught as soon as I hit the end.
[2:25:06] <+dualviper25> @XeroSigmaPrime YOUR RIGHT Trump was trying to avoid UFO aliens from infiltrations our southern apace wall
[2:25:07] <%Shadowthedigger> Why is that lake just a heart?
[2:25:11] <+JavaManJoJo> @AngriestPat A level 2 zipline is 350, if you didn't know
[2:25:11] <agumon9000> @AngriestPat If you build 10 ziplines in your game only 3 will be ported over to your world
[2:25:17] <Mister_McDerp> those are all from different people
[2:25:21] <zenith0111> @shadowthedigger Because Subtext is for cowards
[2:25:21] <%Maids4lyfe> I wish upgrading structures made them take up less bandwidth
[2:25:25] <Mister_McDerp> they might not connect at all
[2:25:25] <%J_Papa> Just start your own zipline network yourself and see if they start to link up with online ones naturally
[2:25:27] <%ChaosAethr> ok thank you for clearing that
[2:25:28] <blackesteagle> is that heart or balls shaped lake?
[2:25:36] <HoIlywood_SN> Heart shaped Balls
[2:25:36] <faldin> balls
[2:25:37] <%StaceMcGate> balls-shaped
[2:25:40] <%Doomcoder> hearts are the balls of the soul
[2:25:42] <%TheMilhouseExperience> @shadowthedigger because it’s subtle.
[2:25:57] <FutaSnek> Heart Shaped Balls is my fav nirvanah song
[2:25:59] <+dualviper25> If you look at balls from the right angle it forms a heart
[2:25:59] <%neodeltai> Balls are the heart of the ween.
[2:26:02] <%Divryne> Heart shaped balls.
[2:26:08] <katocrimson> ballman
[2:26:10] <%StaceMcGate> Is there anything subtle in this game?
[2:26:10] <OrangeMDT> where is this man going
[2:26:14] <zenith0111> @maids4lyfe They hardly take up bandwidth anyways. Ziplines only cost 500 a pop and I have a max of 40k bandwidth that I'm only using half of
[2:26:23] <%Keyd00d> Heart is stored in the balls
[2:26:23] <+zombibyte_> @AngriestPat make a strand contract with them and get the rest of their ziplines if they made anymore
[2:26:27] <%Divryne> Shut up Diehardman.
[2:26:35] <phoenix032797> No
[2:26:43] <%neodeltai> The crushing loneliness is pretty subtle, but that’s about it.
[2:26:44] <%Strider222> die dieman
[2:26:50] <Habblewater> Do you have any potions? Or Food?

[2:27:38] <sovayell> hoi chat, what happened to goldenboy sam?
[2:27:43] <%Doomcoder> it IS the skyrim skeleton. it's the Draugr

[2:27:59] <mayorrev> oh boy
[2:28:02] <zenith0111> @maids4lyfe They're very worth maxing out. Especially if you want more Lore.
[2:28:08] <ShichiNoBushi> Look out for the black strands.
[2:28:11] <%Strider222> skyrim belongs to the nords
[2:28:12] <Kalinflip> nice placement

[2:28:16] <katocrimson> yeyeye
[2:28:16] <%J_Papa> I just watched Wollie's recent Death Stranding video, I really like the guy but my god I don't think I can keep watching them
[2:28:19] <%zv1neda> did pat ever find the collector because it really helps in snow areas?
[2:28:19] <%TheMilhouseExperience> Timefall didn’t melt

[2:29:07] <%KazMkII> @J_Papa what happened in it?

[2:30:44] <%DedlokPM> It can't mend a broken heart. doodSad @AngriestPat
[2:30:48] <$FluffiTamamo> Not after Paige murders it
[2:30:52] <%CrabSlacks> it can't see why kids love the taste of cinnamon toast crunch
[2:30:57] <%zv1neda> the ziplines REALLY help in this area of the game
[2:30:59] <cheesedburgers> Also imo it looks the coolest, not a fan of the power skeletons Gekko legs
[2:31:01] <%misha_kastrilevich> What does Monster Energy taste like cause I have a can here and I never tasted Monster before
[2:31:09] <%TheMilhouseExperience> You say that...
[2:31:10] <Teaka> Hey @AngriestPat I've been avoiding streams because spoilers, but how're you liking the game?
[2:31:23] <%StaceMcGate> yeyeyeye
[2:31:30] <%This_is_Marco> this is exactly where I have ziplines
[2:31:30] <+dualviper25> @CrabSlacks Its a slippery slope tyhat ends up with teenagers suckin dik for lucky charms behind a giant eagle
[2:31:33] <Demon_chann> @misha_kastrilevich is it zero or normal?
[2:31:39] <zenith0111> @misha_kastrilevich Like drinking flavored gasoline
[2:31:44] <$FluffiTamamo> @misha_kastrilevich If it’s the standard green, you might notice a bit of a slimy aftertaste. Not bad tho
[2:31:46] <Mendin> upgrade that one to 350 range and you're Gucci?
[2:31:53] <%misha_kastrilevich> It's normal
[2:31:55] <%Strider222> monster tastes simpp
[2:31:58] <%GeneralSCPatton> @dualviper25 Sounds like a good time
[2:32:16] <Teaka> @misha_kastrilevich I think the taste comes from the ginseng, I think it tastes like cotton candy sort of
[2:32:18] <%TheMilhouseExperience> Wait until the oracle.

[2:32:54] <mayorrev> ROAD TIME
[2:32:58] <%MoraMiarty> what happened to all the goooooooold
[2:33:02] <%takiyami> Power skele might be a good idea
[2:33:05] <%thenumber5point5> no doctor bridge on this server wow
[2:33:12] <%StaceMcGate> This stream has had a lack of ROAD BUILDING for me
[2:33:16] <Teaka> @sovayell that tells me all I need to know hahah thanks

[2:33:28] <%Animorphimagi> no mustard
[2:33:32] <Mastigias> Sky Roads
[2:33:34] <zenith0111> I highly recommend everyone to max out the collector right away as his upgrades will always be useful
[2:33:40] <SomersaultJustice> it was a red mustard bottle
[2:33:41] <Teaka> a zipline is an entire road on one rope
[2:33:41] <%wookie5358> at this point, I'd not even be surprised if Paige had a ketchup bottle
[2:33:42] <%StaceMcGate> @AngriestPat have you found more condiments in your bed?
[2:33:47] <+NitronStreams> skroads
[2:33:48] <%TheMilhouseExperience> Terrain skeleton is essential for the second third of the game.
[2:33:48] <SpaceGuntank> you should also probably make some Timefall shelters up on that mountain seeing how it eats your cargo at 2x the rate
[2:33:52] <The_Forgotten_Alligator> this game is good
[2:33:52] <jack_s1n> sky roads
[2:33:55] <TheDr0t> @zenith0111 like what?
[2:34:03] <Teaka> @NitronStreams that sounds like an STD
[2:34:06] <%MoraMiarty> does time fall become time snow?
[2:34:18] <astroPunkFunk> make BB feel better!!
[2:34:19] <zenith0111> @thedr0t A backpack cover that prevents timefall from damaging cargo
[2:34:20] <%Bane_Kaikyo> @MoraMiarty yes
[2:34:24] <%joylent_blue> MoraMiarty yeah
[2:34:25] <%StaceMcGate> product consumed
[2:34:26] <%Alpha8087> God they should have made timesnow freeze time
[2:34:26] <mayorrev> hi fragile
[2:34:32] <%Doomcoder> make BB feel better by increasing how haunted the area is
[2:34:35] <+dualviper25> @StaceMcGate the neibors are getting tired of oat yelling "theres mustard EVERYWHEWRE
[2:34:35] <%joylent_blue> MoraMiarty its like super timefall too
[2:34:41] <katocrimson> suprising all those lines are all different people but they manage to connect somehow
[2:34:41] <%wookie5358> we're going skiing!
[2:34:42] <%TheMilhouseExperience> @moramiarty yes, but it doesn’t melt so it retains properties.
[2:34:46] <+D00msDayDan> wait why are you going back
[2:34:52] <mayorrev> whoaaaaa
[2:34:56] <+Yagerme> I spent two day building all the roads back made my life easier
[2:34:56] <mayorrev> looka t that skyscraper
[2:34:57] <%MoraMiarty> so snowy mountains are just perma fucked?
[2:34:58] <andresisant> Pat you can extend the range of the Zipline if you upgrade it
[2:35:01] <sovayell> i ended up 100% finishing the game last night and I legit felt sad that it was all over

[2:35:23] <Guardiansaiyan> @misha_kastrilevich yes
[2:35:26] <zenith0111> Upgrading it by 50m is actually like 100m
[2:35:29] <cheesedburgers> AMCs the ride also exists don’t think about it
[2:35:30] <%aishman> UPGRADE IT

[2:35:40] <+dualviper25> @misha_kastrilevich monster is what caused this AND MONSTER IS THE CURE
[2:35:41] <$velgaduere> @misha_kastrilevich the only answer is "yes"
[2:35:55] <%Doomcoder> Monster Energy has no biological components in it and therefore is immune to the Death Stranding
[2:36:01] <HoIlywood_SN> Monster is not a drink produced by a company, it is the elixir produced from the teat of a dark old god from beyond the seam of time and space itself
[2:36:03] <%This_is_Marco> boo
[2:36:11] <%aishman> Oh that sucks
[2:36:14] <zenith0111> Radius: 350 Diameter: 700
[2:36:15] <HoIlywood_SN> it is the beast that lurks beyond, so that it may give you heart attacks
[2:36:22] <astroPunkFunk> this skelleton is not nearly thicc enough
[2:36:24] <%SlashHabit> what's the point of survival if you know the after life exists?
[2:36:25] <%GeneralSCPatton> @AngriestPat Going by the logic of time snow, shouldn't there also be time humidity? Is that why we never go to Florida?
[2:36:30] <Mastigias> Ew, walking?
[2:36:30] <brambobelurkin> ill lurk in your beyond
[2:36:31] <sovayell> walking in a post-zipline world, disGUSTING
[2:36:35] <%StaceMcGate> @AngriestPat Is the monster product placement better or worse than doritos and axe body spray
[2:36:38] <katocrimson> praise the bridge
[2:36:39] <%thenumber5point5> ya it's a super easy run, built a bridge over the gap
[2:36:39] <%TheMilhouseExperience> Yeah that’s why I recommended it.
[2:36:42] <MichaelDood> COULD IT BE
[2:36:43] <%Alpha8087> @GeneralSCPatton I feel attacked at tha tstatement lol
[2:36:44] <+D00msDayDan> god bridge

[2:36:57] <Psyramics> The entirety of Florida is a BT area because its where everyone went to retire
[2:36:58] <%joylent_blue> yeah i bet

[2:37:05] <Mister_McDerp> @GeneralSCPatton we'd be fucked here in Louisiana then
[2:37:07] <sovayell> cool trick

[2:38:19] <%BurningLlama777> Die Hardman: "Now, you're really gonna have to work hard to earn these preppers' trust"
[2:38:28] <deviate_dv8> "It will be hard convincing people."
[2:38:29] <%l3sovikk> So, what's in those things on his necklace?
[2:38:32] <%J_Papa> So everyone, besides farming what could be some other possible positive effects and uses of Timefall?
[2:38:32] <%Alpha8087> They the shit does he float during this
[2:38:38] <%BurningLlama777> "They're fierce and independent and don't want anything to do with us"
[2:38:39] <Mister_McDerp> remember anyone can join the Union, but you're not allowed to leave
[2:38:41] <%StaceMcGate> preppers frighten easily, but return in greater numbers
[2:38:43] <+dualviper25> @Doomcoder not really but japanese women are usually more meeker then americans
[2:38:44] <zenith0111> @doomcoder She gets more importance in a bit

[2:39:50] <corpsegoo> I need to know did anyone else just use six or seven ladders from the doctor's place to get to heartman or was I the singular hardheaded dumbass

[2:39:55] <%J_Papa> @Doomcoder what? i don't follow
[2:39:56] <%StaceMcGate> Was that a child sex slave? I'm concerned
[2:39:57] <zenith0111> THANKS FOR THE MONSTER DOC
[2:39:59] <%TheMilhouseExperience> If you want to grind now is the time to do it.
[2:40:04] <%Nope80808> I wish they'd bring back JAGERMONSTER they discontinued it cause people kept dyuing from it.
[2:40:05] <%joylent_blue> another word for monster is beast..... SUPER BEAST!
[2:40:05] <carbon458> Doctor recomends MORE MONSTER
[2:40:06] <%Doomcoder> @startstoprepeat the other 1% of doctors couldn't respond, because they were drinking Monster Energy
[2:40:17] <babo____> couldnt they just commission him a new BB?
[2:40:18] <Mendin> "Just like the kid- I MEAN THE BB TOOL"
[2:40:19] <blackesteagle> 9 out of 10 doctors recommend Monster*
[2:40:20] <ALTRNico> but I thought BB is just a tool
[2:40:24] <+SkaiVibration> void out?
[2:40:25] <%wookie5358> mount nut city
[2:40:30] <Guardiansaiyan> BB the TOOL MAN Porter
[2:40:35] <%TheMilhouseExperience> Convulsions AND spasms
[2:40:40] <%Bane_Kaikyo> I like that their chiralgrams look like shit at first, but after they get connected it's a lot better
[2:40:41] <%StaceMcGate> Mount the KNOT
[2:40:41] <zenith0111> @skaivibration ?
[2:40:54] <HyperBomb21> You gotta help out or the BTs will take the knot
[2:40:54] <%Alpha8087> ...Its the northern and souther areas of America just fucked? Why is just the center being done
[2:41:20] <zenith0111> @alpha8087 They were some of the first to go.
[2:41:21] <Guardiansaiyan> @Alpha8087 because KNOTS...but maybe because making water graphics suck for the developers?
[2:41:22] <%joylent_blue> we don't talk about the Dakotas
[2:41:35] <blackesteagle> Gears of Pat
[2:41:38] <%LiquidShake83> no your fine
[2:41:38] <Graxe_> Those two pieces of cargo on the shoulders are rusting super bad
[2:41:43] <StarlingSilence> I do wish the place names were less similar in this game. more than once i've mixed up a waystation/distro/city with the same name and gone on an odyssey for no reason
[2:41:51] <Guardiansaiyan> @Graxe_ not his problem apparently
[2:42:00] <Mister_McDerp> need more axe body spray for your boxes
[2:42:00] <%Alpha8087> I mean considering how much it rains down here in Florida I bet it just disappeared lol
[2:42:23] <+MechaTheSpider> same with seattle, it's raining 9 months a year
[2:42:23] <%StaceMcGate> So using a map scale, do these ziplines connect between hundreds of kilometers?
[2:42:23] <%LiquidShake83> no run it
[2:42:27] <zenith0111> @alpha8087 Oh no I mean they got Nuked and Voided out
[2:42:31] <%LiquidShake83> no zippy
[2:42:43] <+Thorp61> @AngriestPat did you beat the game already?
[2:42:45] <Guardiansaiyan> @Alpha8087 but the housing prices got better because of the rains so you still will have retirement communities even in an apocalyptic wasteland
[2:42:48] <%thenumber5point5> need some doctor zip lines
[2:42:49] <%joylent_blue> Thorp61 big no
[2:42:50] <+hero346> How does pat have 200,000+ likes?
[2:42:53] <%aishman> By the by Pat
[2:42:58] <%aishman> Did you ever end up trying Xrd on Steam?
[2:42:59] <%Doomcoder> Seattle would have to move into the tunnels underneath the city from before the fire
[2:43:00] <%LiquidShake83> pat cheats
[2:43:04] <%aishman> I've been planning on playing it myself.
[2:43:05] <%Alpha8087> @zenith0111 God with so many old people in Florida I bet it became one massive crater
[2:43:08] <%Rumbutt> Build Ziplines
[2:43:11] <Mister_McDerp> BUILD ROADMAN
[2:43:12] <devanmuse> @hero346 He built a LOT of roads
[2:43:12] <MichaelDood> Be Pat.
[2:43:13] <ShichiNoBushi> Chapter 5 out of 15, I believe.
[2:43:17] <djFishmonger> Has Pat actually died yet?
[2:43:18] <%SlashHabit> be a streaner
[2:43:21] <%Thorp61> Thorp61 subscribed with Twitch Prime.

[2:43:22] <+Eclipse_knight_> influencer
[2:43:25] <Scrub_Seeker> chapter 6 actually
[2:43:26] <%Rumbutt> 4 hours of Ziplines and beer yesterday, totally worth it
[2:43:29] <%StaceMcGate> @AngriestPat You're an influencer in Death Stranding, time to use that clout
[2:43:31] <%DedlokPM> @ShichiNoBushi Chapter 6 actually
[2:43:34] <Sprawler14> Oh hey I actually made it to a stream
[2:43:34] <Psyramics> He had a void out once off stream
[2:43:37] <%wookie5358> maybe in the future there will be porters and sam sites
[2:43:41] <%Alpha8087> GUN
[2:43:42] <ShichiNoBushi> @djFishmonger He has apparently voided out off stream.
[2:43:42] <%J_Papa> I think that number includes NPC likes
[2:43:43] <Sprawler14> Love u Elmo
[2:43:44] <superd4v3> @Alpha8087 Better job than what Bugs Bunny did
[2:43:46] <+hero346> I barely have 100,000 myself but i do both roads and ziplines mostly
[2:43:48] <%GeneralSCPatton> It's not hard. I got a screenshot of myself with 123456 likes
[2:43:51] <Mister_McDerp> the GUN is good
[2:43:51] <+NitronStreams> MORE GUN
[2:43:59] <%Alpha8087> Gun go up
[2:44:04] <jacksawjack> be interesting to see ho speedruns are gonna turn out
[2:44:15] <mayorrev> s t r a n d s
[2:44:18] <mayorrev> b o n d s
[2:44:18] <%Alpha8087> Oh man I wanna see speedruns of this shit
[2:44:21] <%BallerSwagBro9k> Jesus
[2:44:23] <Sprawler14> Big sprints
[2:44:23] <korth367> glitches
[2:44:25] <%nofestu2> Did you know Humans need connections?
[2:44:26] <%Animorphimagi> code for internet sex
[2:44:27] <%Doomcoder> 99% cargo damage every time
[2:44:29] <%BallerSwagBro9k> No glitch runs?
[2:44:30] <superd4v3> @jacksawjack oh there's people that have already speed-run the game
[2:44:31] <$HyperionXV> No major glitches yet
[2:44:32] <%zv1neda> jesus
[2:44:36] <LunarRemix> Couldn't they just radio to talk with each other?
[2:44:37] <%Laecerelius> I'm excited to see the speedrun at the next GDQ event
[2:44:39] <%wookie5358> are speed runs allowed to be online?
[2:44:44] <zenith0111> 4hrs unoptimized
[2:44:46] <jacksawjack> why'd I bother asking, lol
[2:44:47] <%joylent_blue> wookie5358 no
[2:44:48] <$HyperionXV> online is a seperate catagory
[2:44:48] <%J_Papa> Do speedrunners purposely give BB autotoxemia so there's no BT detection animation?
[2:44:51] <%rumtumtugnutz> if you fart into someones butthole is that sex
[2:44:54] <%BallerSwagBro9k> Like Pat LUL
[2:44:54] <%Alpha8087> Man wouldnt speedruns be hella reliant on the RNG of getting others buildings and vehicles?
[2:44:54] <%GeneralSCPatton> Eh, it was 5 hours 40 minutes last I saw
[2:44:55] <%thenumber5point5> could see it if you mainline the story and do no building
[2:45:05] <%wookie5358> then that's ridiculous. or fun exploits
[2:45:05] <ShichiNoBushi> I've had some glitches, but only where I get the out of service borders showing up where I still have connection.
[2:45:11] <%BallerSwagBro9k> Aww thanks Pat
[2:45:11] <zenith0111> @alpha8087 There's a built in offline mode
[2:45:14] <Sprawler14> Friendship ended with power skeleton
[2:45:19] <$HyperionXV> basically the only building they do is generators and ziplines
[2:45:19] <%joylent_blue> love you too pat
[2:45:20] <The_Forgotten_Alligator> maybe spend a whole day building stuff all over the place, then start the speedrun and use the stuff
[2:45:22] <Sprawler14> All terrain skeleton is my new best friend
[2:45:23] <+hero346> Imagine a zipline system that literally connects all of the preppers/distro centers
[2:45:31] <%TheMilhouseExperience> Speed skeleton hopping through snow is really good.
[2:45:34] <%king_wragles> ssssttttrrraaannnndddsssss
[2:45:38] <%king_wragles> what I miss?
[2:45:40] <%StaceMcGate> Why isn't Paige showing up each time you say skeleton? @AngriestPat
[2:45:41] <%Alpha8087> Ohhh okay yeah I guess offline mode would be the fairest.
[2:45:49] <+silvery_cricket> It sucks there is no Mail Man costume
[2:45:51] <+hero346> Speed skeleton is my personal favorite
[2:45:52] <munchkay> too soon
[2:45:52] <+D00msDayDan> mountaineer gives a good shit
[2:45:52] <HyperBomb21> @hero346 that's the meta strat once you get zip-lines
[2:46:00] <Mister_McDerp> I hope he's a big hairy mountain man
[2:46:01] <cheesedburgers> I didn’t take it off once I got it, I forgot it was even on until it ran out of battery one time
[2:46:06] <HyperBomb21> Zip line network to all mountain locations
[2:46:09] <superd4v3> @silvery_cricket Oh just wait till the PC version comes out
[2:46:10] <ShichiNoBushi> You are definately going to want to set up a zipline network between him and Doctor.
[2:46:14] <+silvery_cricket> THEY ALL GIVE GRAT UPGRADES
[2:46:15] <+JavaManJoJo> Have we been wrong?
[2:46:15] <%TheMilhouseExperience> Do you want to know his drop?
[2:46:16] <%deviljhojho_> THEY DO tho
[2:46:17] <devanmuse> @king_wragles He aborted a ghost baby
[2:46:18] <+D00msDayDan> and they have every time
[2:46:18] <%StaceMcGate> Monster lvl 3
[2:46:19] <startstoprepeat> basically yeah
[2:46:19] <%Rumbutt> They're good upgrades Pront
[2:46:20] <zenith0111> YES THEY DO
[2:46:20] <HyperBomb21> They ALL do
[2:46:23] <+hero346> @hyperbomb21 We need everyone to work together to accomplish that
[2:46:25] <%MoraMiarty> it feels like this is a game where every upgrade is a sick upgrade
[2:46:26] <cheesedburgers> THEY REALLY DO
[2:46:29] <Mister_McDerp> need monster lv. 3
[2:46:30] <%TheMilhouseExperience> Egg it’s okay.
[2:46:32] <cheesedburgers> well not all but this dude yes
[2:46:33] <%king_wragles> @devanmuse was it Mama's?
[2:46:35] <%CrabSlacks> this must be the guy with the rcket boots
[2:46:36] <%Alpha8087> Confidants are like strands, man
[2:46:39] <HyperBomb21> @hero346 it would be better if people worked on the roads instead
[2:46:41] <zenith0111> I can't think of one where I was like "Fuck this upgrade"
[2:46:42] <%thenumber5point5> his stuff is usefull but not game changeing
[2:46:44] <+DRAGKUDO> !update
[2:46:46] <%TheMilhouseExperience> Egh*
[2:46:48] <superd4v3> @AngriestPat You should try to max out the Collector at least.
[2:46:49] <%J_Papa> You can connect every shelter with ziplines, but by the time you've increased your chiral bandwidth by increasing your rep with them you no longer need the ziplines lol
[2:46:51] <Sprawler14> Number get bigger dick get harder
[2:46:52] <%LiquidShake83> Cheer100 Cheer100 Cheer100 Cheer100 Cheer100 Here's some bits to help you save Murica!
[2:46:53] <+DRAGKUDO> !uptime
[2:46:54] <@Moobot> I've been playing this game for how long? Oh only 2h 46m.
[2:46:57] <devanmuse> @king_wragles If there are other ghost babies in this game, it'd be news to me
[2:46:58] <%StaceMcGate> You really want to level up the Sun Confidant to get the good shit
[2:47:03] <+hero346> @hyperbomb21 Tbh you’re right especially on the west side of the map
[2:47:03] <RascheTheRabbit> pat smells pass it on
[2:47:07] <+DRAGKUDO> so what's happened so far?
[2:47:09] <%wookie5358> does that make Takemi the death stranding? @Alpha8087
[2:47:11] <%Meow0369> Cargo lvl 2 gold cover

[2:47:21] <%Maids4lyfe> backpack cover
[2:47:22] <+silvery_cricket> Is Kojima the final client, and you deliver a copy of Death Stranding to him?
[2:47:22] <%TheMilhouseExperience> Honestly the collector is the most useful person
[2:47:25] <+hero346> Pat whats your favorite character so far?
[2:47:29] <%thenumber5point5> the cargo cover you allready have
[2:47:31] <%king_wragles> It's nuts that you said "aborted a ghost baby" @devanmuse and my reaction was essentially "oh, who's was it?" and not "fucking WHAT?!"
[2:47:32] <superd4v3> @AngriestPat He gives you a warp that resists timefall for your cargo
[2:47:35] <%TheMilhouseExperience> Really good blood grenades
[2:47:37] <Mister_McDerp> build zipman
[2:47:40] <shoobieredgrave> those ziplines are whores
[2:47:43] <HoIlywood_SN> @AngriestPat how big of a load can you take?
[2:47:44] <@commanderclaw> Pat knows all about taking big loads
[2:47:44] <superd4v3> @AngriestPat *wrap
[2:47:44] <%Alpha8087> @wookie5358 ...God that hurt my brain it was so right

[2:47:59] <FutaSnek> Taking big loads katieLewd katieWink
[2:48:03] <%Divryne> ONEGUY STRIKES AGAIN.
[2:48:05] <%Doomcoder> @faldin tar ghost who grabs your ankles in a dream, dunno if there's anything else
[2:48:05] <corpsegoo> as long as the cargo is on your back and there's nothing in your hands the ziplines will take anyload
[2:48:11] <jack_s1n> a better one
[2:48:12] <ShichiNoBushi> I got Lvl. 2 one and haven't gotten any other.
[2:48:14] <Sprawler14> That's a big zip

[2:48:35] <%Alpha8087> A spook is here
[2:48:36] <seycheles> big pat ghosts
[2:48:37] <%joylent_blue> go to that BT zone

[2:49:04] <%thenumber5point5> book it and build on the other side and never deal with that cursed area again
[2:49:04] <+dualviper25> I will proceed to fck myself

[2:49:20] <%StaceMcGate> "Sam, as you know, one guy gave wrong advice"
[2:49:22] <+TaylOctopus91> should have brought a sticky gun
[2:49:24] <%Alpha8087> Upgrade the zipline, yeah
[2:49:25] <zenith0111> @cheesedburgers It's not the snow itself it's the temperature in the mountains
[2:49:28] <superd4v3> @AngriestPat upgrades the ziplinez Pat
[2:49:29] <%TheMilhouseExperience> Just use a bike
[2:49:32] <%MrBorisMakarov> don't worry about it @crimsonharvest
[2:49:32] <fr3shcutcabbage> So Pat calls RDR2 boring, but loves this game?
[2:49:33] <Frozenflame01> guess upgrade the zip line
[2:49:38] <%joylent_blue> long long maaaaaaaaaan
[2:49:39] <+dualviper25> MY BODY IS READY
[2:49:46] <taxidriver95> and yeah all terrain skeleton is the best shit ever
[2:49:46] <+DRAGKUDO> Red dead is boring
[2:49:48] <%BallerSwagBro9k> @fr3shcutcabbage It's fiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiine LUL
[2:49:53] <startstoprepeat> rdr2 feels bad to play, this game feels great
[2:49:56] <%MalekDracarus> There was already a zipline system ready for me when I went to the mountaineer... This might suck a little...
[2:49:57] <taxidriver95> you should get the lvl 3 one
[2:49:58] <%J_Papa> Not enough cash!
[2:50:00] <%FrostMass22> @fr3shcutcabbage Because Pat hates America
[2:50:04] <%rumtumtugnutz> Read Dead 2 IS boring.
[2:50:06] <%thenumber5point5> no building/helping the world in RDR2
[2:50:09] <munchkay> the fucking WHIPLASH on those Ziplines
[2:50:13] <ianabstract> Check the share locker?
[2:50:15] <+NitronStreams> Chemical Dependency
[2:50:15] <+goldfingers16> zipline is love, zipline is life Kreygasm
[2:50:19] <+earthboy2k> RDR2 is trash
[2:50:19] <+Kriptin> "I'll show you all when I get my chemicals" Is Pat going on Steroids
[2:50:22] <%LiquidShake83> love is just chemicals - wooliethepiethief
[2:50:26] <%joylent_blue> can you build ziplines in rdr2? didn't think so pvpSass
[2:50:27] <%TheMilhouseExperience> Pat why you so broke?
[2:50:31] <+dualviper25> Spray your chemicals all over my face
[2:50:32] <Mister_McDerp> give me your emotions old man!
[2:50:34] <%supersugoisenpai1> Emotions are just chemicals
[2:50:34] <%kyuubisonic> red dead is nothing like this game, i like both but they're very different.
[2:50:34] <%J_Papa> Sam Porter Ziplines returns
[2:50:34] <tr00ly_> ke- emichals
[2:50:37] <Sprawler14> Jesse open up the lab
[2:50:41] <zenith0111> @joylent_blue No ... but you can fish PogChamp
[2:50:50] <+hero346> Imagine if Sam had a secret twin we didn’t know about
[2:50:53] <%StaceMcGate> I refuse to believe that anyone thinks the shooting in this game is good
[2:51:05] <%rumtumtugnutz> This is a game that is dull by design, so you don't expect some grand adventure it doesn't deliver on
[2:51:13] <%TheMilhouseExperience> That was a jokt
[2:51:17] <@commanderclaw> This game is the inverse of the Ubisoft open world, rather than removing things on the map you're adding them
[2:51:19] <faldin> maybe shotting people is bad
[2:51:20] <IAmYoungDabNow> I watch this game so I can fall asleep
[2:51:21] <%TheMilhouseExperience> Joke*
[2:51:21] <%Explodincatz> just like Metal Gear
[2:51:21] <shoobieredgrave> No the weapons feel like Metal gear
[2:51:22] <%Bane_Kaikyo> Pat, why not carry a floaty boi for downhill treks?
[2:51:23] <%Animorphimagi> rifle is GOOD. TURN OFF AUTO AIM
[2:51:24] <faldin> shotting
[2:51:28] <faldin> frick
[2:51:29] <%SlashHabit> not precious if you get a second life
[2:51:30] <startstoprepeat> level 3 ar is pretty nice, but i still wish there was an ads
[2:51:30] <+dualviper25> to be fair i never used a single lethal weapon is MGS 5 so not suprised
[2:51:32] <NotHereToStream> i feel like combat was an afterthought in this game
[2:51:39] <Sprawler14> Gun bad, but Video Game and Semen delivery good
[2:51:40] <zenith0111> @angriestpat Lethal Weapons do the most damage on BTs
[2:51:42] <+JavaManJoJo> I thought it felt fine, but I only used the non lethal gun
[2:51:42] <%thenumber5point5> there is a gun later on that is pretty good
[2:51:44] <+JonWhoLovesFlatWomen> JonWhoLovesFlatWomen subscribed with Twitch Prime. They've subscribed for 5 months! 
[2:51:49] <Guardiansaiyan> @AngriestPat Turn off auto aim for better gns
[2:51:51] <+hero346> Nonlethal weapons in metal gear are the most broken ones
[2:51:56] <%cureneckbeard> !uptime
[2:51:56] <%Animorphimagi> @AngriestPat is auto aim on?
[2:51:56] <@Moobot> I've been playing this game for how long? Oh only 2h 51m.
[2:52:01] <%rumtumtugnutz> If you have to turn off a game mechanic for something in a game to be good, that thing is not good.
[2:52:03] <%TheMilhouseExperience> Just play like you’re John Wick. It saves Watch Dogs 1.
[2:52:04] <cheesedburgers> It’s hard to get used to the shooting because you pull out a gun like once every 12 hours, but even then it’s not titanfall
[2:52:06] <%JonWhoLovesFlatWomen> @angriestpat please sign my BB pod
[2:52:08] <%J_Papa> Taking guys out with cargo is how a real porter gets it done
[2:52:18] <DesuDesuDokiDoki> show tummy
[2:52:21] <FutaSnek> Oooh yea they probably pumped this shit fulla auto aim
[2:52:24] <DesuDesuDokiDoki> show pepis
[2:52:35] <%StaceMcGate> Non-lethal weapons ruined Metal Gear for me, I could never use lethals arms once I learned you are rewarded for not killing
[2:52:40] <%joylent_blue> i miss BB FeelsBadMan
[2:52:41] <zenith0111> I always take auto aim off in every videogame I play tbh. I hate how they feel most the time
[2:52:42] <+dualviper25> @DesuDesuDokiDoki THIS IS A CHRISTIAN STREAM
[2:52:46] <+hero346> Yeah
[2:52:49] <HoIlywood_SN> @rumtumtugnutz i mean to be fair auto aim is shit in literally every game
[2:52:49] <Mister_McDerp> now you are a REAL gamer
[2:52:50] <rufus2k2> i got a dumb question, assuming the Death Stranding servers go down can you just build those bridges yourself for your own game?
[2:52:56] <%Piemen99> YES PAT KILL THEM ALL
[2:52:56] <@commanderclaw> We will find out in nine years when Pat gets dragged to the War of 1812
[2:53:03] <shoobieredgrave> LUL
[2:53:09] <faldin> at least you can skip most of the animations in this
[2:53:09] <%Meow0369> so this but less shooting
[2:53:11] <HyperBomb21> Red Dead 2 feels like ass to play
[2:53:11] <DesuDesuDokiDoki> red ded is not autistic enough
[2:53:18] <%wookie5358> if you touch someone with your horse in red dead 2 they blast your face off
[2:53:20] <red_blaster> Like Minecraft
[2:53:20] <%poohtrailsnailcooch> This game is nothing like RD@
[2:53:22] <%poohtrailsnailcooch> 2
[2:53:22] <shoobieredgrave> i like this game too but cmon they're the same in a lot of ways
[2:53:24] <+hero346> Especially hurts in mgsv when you get a shitload of weapons but like why would you ever use them over nonlethal when sneaking
[2:53:25] <%Explodincatz> does RD2 have any upgrade system?
[2:53:27] <zenith0111> Navigation is the biggest appeal I have with this game
[2:53:30] <Mister_McDerp> I liked RDR2, but I played it like hunting and fishing simulator
[2:53:30] <%joylent_blue> figuring out how to optimize shit is integral in this game
[2:53:31] <FutaSnek> Red dead was immersion over gameplay
[2:53:31] <NotHereToStream> but horseball techonology though Kappa
[2:53:33] <%GeneralSCPatton> @AngriestPat Why is cremating the dead even a problem? Should be able to gun down the mules, pyrolyze them in a vacuum, and compact the ash into a chiral brick. Why the smokestacks?
[2:53:36] <%poohtrailsnailcooch> RD2 honestly held your hand way tooo mcuh
[2:53:38] <%StaceMcGate> Red Dead 2 didn't have likes or CHIRAL network
[2:53:42] <Sokumotanaka> Guys guys they both suck, now kiss
[2:53:42] <%SlashHabit> @AngriestPat Not sure if the're comparable
[2:53:43] <+dualviper25> @wookie5358 can you blame them they are all SUPER allergic to horses
[2:53:45] <%Meow0369> Red dead Online is super fun now with collector role
[2:53:45] <@commanderclaw> RDR2 is totally up it's ass with the story
[2:53:46] <ALTRNico> there's a reason why they had an auto ride to checkpoint
[2:53:46] <corpsegoo> red dead disapoints me by not feeding my thirst for trashy spaghetti westerns
[2:53:46] <%Divryne> RDR2 is too many menial tasks that take too long to complete like skinning animals.
[2:53:47] <zenith0111> I hate Open World games that feel redundant in their design. DS feels natural
[2:53:50] <%joylent_blue> RDR2 theres not a whole lot of thought that goes into traversal
[2:53:50] <%JustToWatch> the speed at witch you pick up items perfectly explains the difference
[2:53:51] <%Alpha8087> FLY PAT FLY
[2:53:52] <%rumtumtugnutz> @HoIlywood_SN It usually is, but if it's a make or break situation then I still argue it means the shooting mechanic is still bad.
[2:53:54] <Sprawler14> A non-lethal bonus in MGSV will never stop me from doing a minigun helicopter landing
[2:53:54] <%BallerSwagBro9k> But Pat the REaLIsM
[2:53:55] <NotHereToStream> watch nakeyjakey video on rdr2, he makes a ton of good point
[2:53:57] <Nested_Dreams> RDR is a murder fest, Death Stranding is a help fest
[2:53:59] <HyperBomb21> I hated how I had to hold a button and watch a mini cutscene just o pick anything up in RDR21
[2:54:00] <Habblewater> Can't get sexually harrassed by Del Toro in RDR2
[2:54:02] <TheDr0t> @angriestpat fun fact mule trucks carry less cargo coz they have a slot for 6 bodies
[2:54:06] <%aishman> Also was it me or did Red Dead 2 just feel like
[2:54:07] <+D00msDayDan> legend medals
[2:54:07] <%StaceMcGate> I don't like this game either, I hate realism in games
[2:54:07] <%aishman> SUPER heavy

[2:54:13] <%Nope80808> Nakeyjakey's video on RDR2 pretty much summarizes its issues real great.
[2:54:14] <+TrevSmith222> I'm surprised I actually enjoyed RDR2, but I did.
[2:54:17] <+Punchasaur> WE NEED MONEY SAM
[2:54:18] <+JavaManJoJo> @AngriestPat You actually have to think about moving around in this game which keeps it engaging versus just holding a direction while looking at your phone in many other games
[2:54:24] <Sokumotanaka> major whiplash
[2:54:26] <M4eta> !uptime
[2:54:27] <%poohtrailsnailcooch> NakeyJakey Did i a great review on RD2 and hit some solid pooints

[2:54:28] <@Moobot> I've been playing this game for how long? Oh only 2h 54m.
[2:54:31] <%wookie5358> I'd love to see reedus riding a motorcycle through red dead 2 in his new AMC show ride
[2:54:32] <zenith0111> @hyperbomb21 Oddly enough Sam does to but without the lengthy animation LUL just snatches it and goes
[2:54:41] <HyperBomb21> That's all it need
[2:54:45] <%J_Papa> What yellow thing does he mean? Is it covered by the cam?
[2:54:47] <%Laecerelius> Please enjoy upgrade
[2:54:47] <cheesedburgers> This game makes you look at the terrain in a completely different way than other open worlds, which is a weird thing to say and this game is for weird losers but it works
[2:54:50] <+dualviper25> @Moobot SHUT IT MOOBOT YOU DIDNT PLAY NOTHIN
[2:54:54] <HyperBomb21> RDR2 wastes your time
[2:54:58] <Sprawler14> RDR2 has a nice story but yeah the railroad-y missions are a pain

[2:57:59] <%BallerSwagBro9k> Can you escape from these guys?
[2:58:02] <KeystoneA1> Don't coward out this time
[2:58:03] <%RAGING_1NF3RNO> Hey, guys. I'm a new sub and I didn't get an invite to the Discord. Can anyone help me with that?
[2:58:05] <NeroInfinite> Ah, just like monhun
[2:58:06] <ShichiNoBushi> Do you deal extra damage if you hit them in the middle of an attack?
[2:58:15] <%joylent_blue> MoraMiarty yeah if the grabby hand ghosts deplete your stamina this happens
[2:58:15] <Bigyin396> That thing is by far the coolest thing in the game that I've seen
[2:58:15] <OldManDeckardCain> too bad the bosses are ez in this game LUL
[2:58:17] <%wookie5358> it has an anus for a face
[2:58:21] <%Bane_Kaikyo> I wonder what happens when you shoot a bola at those things
[2:58:22] <ThatOneGuyYouSaw> >discord

[2:58:35] <zenith0111> @shichinobushi You can do extra damage if you throw the grenade and shoot bullets thew the clouds
[2:58:38] <Sprawler14> ah yes
[2:58:39] <HoIlywood_SN> crab
[2:58:40] <+hero346> You do a lot of damage if you throw a grenade and then shoot bullets through the blood smoke
[2:58:41] <Sprawler14> time for crab
[2:58:41] <%Explodincatz> crab
[2:58:41] <%sovayell> sovayell subscribed at Tier 1.

[2:59:08] <%Laecerelius> YEYEYEYEYEYE!
[2:59:08] <%J_Papa> Pat you should be carrying a an Anti-BT Handgun around, it's the best weapon for Catchers when fired full charge
[2:59:09] <$Yakobro> YEAH BT LIKES
[2:59:10] <%StaceMcGate> BT LIKED THAT
[2:59:10] <Habblewater> right in the dick
[2:59:12] <Mister_McDerp> PREY SLAUGHTERED
[2:59:15] <ShichiNoBushi> @zenith0111 I know about that. I meant in the middle of the BT's attack. The slow-down makes it seem rather dramatic.
[2:59:15] <%Doomcoder> whoah
[2:59:18] <NeroInfinite> LIKES FROM BT
[2:59:20] <zenith0111> I recommend playing this game on hard if anyone wants to have a more Dark Souls feel
[2:59:21] <+goldfingers16> face To face
[2:59:24] <HyperBomb21> @AngriestPat You'll do more damage if you shoot the red areas on the BT with a lethal weapon
[2:59:24] <%TheMilhouseExperience> And dead
[2:59:25] <%joylent_blue> CARVE IT
[2:59:25] <%zv1neda> NOW CARVE
[2:59:26] <Mendin> Big dank c rystals
[2:59:31] <%sovayell> gg Sam
[2:59:31] <%Divryne> There's a memory chip around there.
[2:59:33] <%wookie5358> at least their death is quite handy
[2:59:34] <%neodeltai> Right in the pecker!
[2:59:35] <%zv1neda> hope you get a gem
[2:59:35] <cheesedburgers> Returning to base in 60 seconds
[2:59:36] <%Alpha8087> Get those Gore Magala parts
[2:59:39] <%Laecerelius> ROAD JUICE!
[2:59:41] <%StaceMcGate> uh ugh uh ugh uh ugh
[2:59:44] <%aishman> OH that's cool, there's snow-less grass where it moved
[2:59:45] <Sprawler14> get any good loot?
[2:59:45] <DesuDesuDokiDoki> scan
[2:59:50] <HoIlywood_SN> @AngriestPat piss on his grave
[2:59:52] <zenith0111> @shichinobushi It's doing slowmo because he's staggering him and canceling the attacks
[2:59:53] <%TheMilhouseExperience> 5 minute cooldown.
[2:59:54] <Mister_McDerp> I like the steel girder totem poles
[2:59:56] <HoIlywood_SN> @AngriestPat piss on the grave of the ghost cat, coward
[3:00:02] <%DrWolpertinger> has Pat made all the roads yet?
[3:00:07] <Graxe_> Can't wait for the Monster Hunter/Death Stranding crossover event where you go out and hunt a BT
[3:00:13] <Graxe_> And then carve it up
[3:00:18] <TheSandmanIsHere> how goes the roadbuilding
[3:00:20] <+hero346> And then piss on it
[3:00:22] <The_Forgotten_Alligator> that would be cool
[3:00:23] <%Laecerelius> He made all the ones he could
[3:00:24] <%wookie5358> if the ghost cat hurts you, would it cause a phantom pain
[3:00:24] <ShichiNoBushi> @zenith0111 I figured that might have been the case if not extra damage.
[3:00:25] <Mendin> Hey Pat, would you theoretically have enough time to drop a blood grenade at your feet when you realized you aggro'd a BT?
[3:00:26] <%Doomcoder> "tastes like voidout!"
[3:00:26] <munchkay> gogogo, before ghost come back
[3:00:35] <%rumtumtugnutz> You are coated in ghost jizz
[3:00:44] <HoIlywood_SN> Phantom Coom
[3:00:44] <ThatOneGuyYouSaw> hawt
[3:00:46] <%StaceMcGate> beware of GHOSTS
[3:00:47] <TheSandmanIsHere> did you find John Marston yet? he should be hiding from wolves up here
[3:00:50] <CatmanIX> he looked like snake for a sec with all that shit on his face LUL
[3:00:54] <Habblewater> Ghost blackface
[3:00:55] <+dualviper25> @rumtumtugnutz arent we all?\
[3:00:56] <zenith0111> If you guys want to run away throw a piss or shit grenade and save blood ones
[3:00:58] <%LiquidShake83> slide down the hill
[3:00:59] <%joylent_blue> BTs giving you likes for killing them is like, the demons in DMC being the ones giving you your style rankings
[3:01:01] <%DedlokPM> @RAGING_1NF3RNO 1) it can take time sometimes and/or someone in it may have to do a manual refresh 2) make sure your discord account is connected to your subbed twitch account 3) go to the connections section in the discord user settings (gear at the bottom)
[3:01:02] <%thenumber5point5> touch past ther generator is a good zip point
[3:01:02] <%TheMilhouseExperience> The west road take SO MUCH Ceramics.
[3:01:03] <%joylent_blue> "that was sick bro good job"
[3:01:06] <DesuDesuDokiDoki> many lost cargos
[3:01:07] <%DrWolpertinger> wait there can't be voidouts in this game, Pat's too good
[3:01:21] <%rumtumtugnutz> @dualviper25 We're all covered in somebody's jizz I'm sure
[3:01:24] <thetruthofyourbeing> hey pat and gang!
[3:01:28] <ThatOneGuyYouSaw> @zenith0111 what's stronger, piss or shit?
[3:01:29] <TheSandmanIsHere> @drwolpertinger except at pizza delivery
[3:01:30] <%sovayell> ziplines feel a bit fickle when it comes to elevation
[3:01:32] <+hero346> When did jizz enter the convo?
[3:01:42] <faldin> wait you can??
[3:01:42] <%thenumber5point5> the valley to the left should give a good sight line
[3:01:44] <%SomeSageAdvice> i am not surprised that people are losing cargo out here at all, this looks nightmarish
[3:01:44] <%joylent_blue> jizz is always in the convo
[3:01:47] <%BallerSwagBro9k> But it was off stream
[3:01:48] <DesuDesuDokiDoki> what does it look like?
[3:01:49] <Dr_Mooose> good rope
[3:01:50] <%neodeltai> Jizz never left the convo.
[3:01:51] <%LiquidShake83> press square
[3:01:51] <%rumtumtugnutz> @hero346 When I said Pat was coated in ghost jizz
[3:01:54] <%king_wragles> Wait, did Pat lose his BB?
[3:01:55] <%Explodincatz> norman misses his BB
[3:01:55] <zenith0111> Kojima did say in a interview there are unforseen consequences for killing BTs. Cutting Cords however gives you likes from BTs. Food for thought.
[3:01:56] <+hero346> Oh
[3:01:57] <%rumtumtugnutz> It was like two minutes ago
[3:02:01] <+hero346> Makes sense
[3:02:03] <TheSandmanIsHere> you gonna put a zipline station up here?
[3:02:04] <+dualviper25> @rumtumtugnutz hell we re are literally made of mutated jizzof your dads if you think about it
[3:02:05] <%aishman> Remember that void outs, eventually, DO disappear with Timefalls
[3:02:06] <corpsegoo> considering the mountains I don't blame porters for saying fuck this noise and dumping their cargo in the nearest valley
[3:02:16] <+hero346> Does the jizz connect us all?
[3:02:17] <HoIlywood_SN> @zenith0111 you will regret your words and deeds
[3:02:19] <%TheMilhouseExperience> Jizz is always in somebody’s hand, waiting to be played.
[3:02:22] <%StaceMcGate> SKYRIM PHYSICS
[3:02:26] <%J_Papa> Activating the All-Terrain Skeleton makes you use battery instead of stamina
[3:02:26] <SetsuRyuu> Was his voidout in part 1?
[3:02:34] <%wookie5358> this is a cool looking skyrim mod
[3:02:35] <Sprawler14> These are your Skyrim Legs
[3:02:37] <DesuDesuDokiDoki> rain was in the way?
[3:02:39] <%joylent_blue> SetsuRyuu someone said it was off-stream
[3:02:40] <%Laecerelius> Pat's voidout was off stream
[3:02:41] <%rumtumtugnutz> Yoou know, in a weird way Jizz IS kind of our own chiral network
[3:02:46] <%sovayell> LUL

[3:03:05] <DesuDesuDokiDoki> PERFECT
[3:03:07] <HoIlywood_SN> Jizz is ropey strands full of potential children, the first true death stranding
[3:03:07] <+hero346> @rumtumtugnutz I like the way you think

[3:03:16] <lethallylactic> LUL
[3:03:17] <rufus2k2> GENERATING SALT IS WHAT IT IS
[3:03:17] <+hero346> Lmao
[3:03:18] <The_Forgotten_Alligator> smart players
[3:03:18] <zenith0111> @thatoneguyyousaw Both have different effects and blast radius. Shit has more of a cloud but less effectiveness but piss makes them run away but you can only hit one usually
[3:03:19] <emperor_z> Is it blocked by the cliffside or the generator itself?
[3:03:20] <%thenumber5point5> edge of network
[3:03:22] <%DrWolpertinger> dismantle it
[3:03:23] <munchkay> dismantle!!
[3:03:25] <NeonBleu> Finally, the trolls have arrived

[3:03:33] <%poohtrailsnailcooch> He probably ran out battery you pansies
[3:03:34] <zenith0111> @thatghostpepper The sweat is the inbetween
[3:03:41] <Reodi> i think it was blocked by that generator
[3:03:45] <Lelfro> you could have dismantled the generator
[3:03:45] <The_Forgotten_Alligator> lmao Trolling in death stranding
[3:03:45] <%Animorphimagi> remember Pat. tons of people hate they game probably because theyre bad at games
[3:03:45] <DesuDesuDokiDoki> dismantle it then pat
[3:03:46] <+dualviper25> maybe it was midway point
[3:03:50] <%wookie5358> death stranding minmaxing
[3:03:50] <%TDAWS_MP132> he did
[3:03:53] <$FluffiTamamo> Mean Pat deleted the waifu’s zip line
[3:04:03] <%TheMilhouseExperience> Probably made for sick snowboarding.
[3:04:06] <%J_Papa> I didn't test it much but it looked like poop attracted BTs to the thrown location
[3:04:07] <+talon84> Do you even Zip bro?
[3:04:08] <@commanderclaw> Is this amateur hour or something?
[3:04:08] <DesuDesuDokiDoki> have you seen the ladders to nothing?
[3:04:19] <+hero346> Idk but most of the lost cargo i find are players with loli profile pics
[3:04:22] <%Doomcoder> built by Sarah Palin
[3:04:29] <zenith0111> @j_papa I've been throwing it at them LUL i should test that
[3:04:38] <munchkay> Pat doing God's work
[3:04:39] <%wookie5358> their fun is wrong
[3:04:42] <valriot> Yeyeye
[3:04:49] <%joylent_blue> everyone get on pat's zipline level
[3:04:50] <HoIlywood_SN> @AngriestPat Pat are you the Death Stranding
[3:04:53] <%StaceMcGate> See that mountain? You can climb it
[3:04:54] <DesuDesuDokiDoki> time to build stuff in the way of it~
[3:04:56] <%DrWolpertinger> He is
[3:05:00] <%linSP> maybe they had the same idea as pat and it was an unfortunate spawn
[3:05:02] <%J_Papa> @zenith0111 i only did it once or twice, they seemed to love it... might have even been eating it
[3:05:05] <@commanderclaw> I'm playing RDR2 right now, and I almost feel like it forgot it was a videogame
[3:05:07] <%LiquidShake83> build a wall around Murica pat. Keep the BT's out!
[3:05:09] <valriot> Has he met Heartman yet?
[3:05:16] <NotHereToStream> no
[3:05:17] <+hero346> Nah
[3:05:20] <+hero346> Thats late in the game
[3:05:21] <%thenumber5point5> put on hat to help with stam
[3:05:26] <djFishmonger> did pat evolve from ROADS to ZIPS
[3:05:27] <TheSandmanIsHere> is Higgs dead yet?
[3:05:30] <zenith0111> @j_papa Weird I definitely need to play with them more then
[3:05:38] <+Kidkidd92> drink monster to stay hydrated
[3:05:39] <%StaceMcGate> @AngriestPat Isn't this game just the plot of Final Fantasy: The Spirits Within
[3:05:41] <%GarbageNirvana> Sam Bridges is climbing the mountain, why is he climbing the mountain?
[3:05:42] <%Doomcoder> "has he [x] yet" is a silly question and also basically a guaranteed spoiler
[3:05:43] <KasiCrafter> From Pat.rar to ***.
[3:05:45] <KeystoneA1> is there a third map in this game?
[3:05:50] <+hero346> @stacemcgate STOP
[3:05:58] <ThatOneGuyYouSaw> @TheSandmanIsHere Higgs likves on in all of our hearts
[3:05:58] <%DedlokPM> @TheSandmanIsHere you could say we are all dead inside. mogsDeadInside
[3:06:01] <HoIlywood_SN> Norman Reedus has to make love to the mountain
[3:06:08] <%TheMilhouseExperience> Nothing was stopping you from doing this when you got here.
[3:06:08] <%joylent_blue> Doomcoder right, i HATE those questions lol
[3:06:14] <TheSandmanIsHere> @stacemcgate and that movie was basically "FF7, but dumber"
[3:06:15] <cheesedburgers> Zip lines are sky roads
[3:06:18] <zenith0111> @keystonea1 Yes actually lol
[3:06:19] <djFishmonger> its like Balto up in here
[3:06:19] <%Bane_Kaikyo> barrels?
[3:06:23] <Sokumotanaka> Iris scan, Iris shut down
[3:06:25] <auspiciousdgg> Prepare to cry guys
[3:06:27] <%Animorphimagi> GET MORE
[3:06:28] <%J_Papa> @zenith0111 idk about you but i haven't found much use for them against Catchers, they do stun them but i hoped it would increase damage or something
[3:06:42] <%wookie5358> things reedus had to do for antibiotics.. you won't believe number 2306
[3:06:42] <%TheMilhouseExperience> Oh no dead pregnant lady.
[3:06:54] <+hero346> Wow
[3:06:58] <+hero346> A rank
[3:07:01] <%juxtest> What she REALLY needs is a pizza
[3:07:02] <TheSandmanIsHere> @doomcoder Higgs is pretty obviously a boss character, I think we even fought him once already. asking if we killed him is perfectly reasonable and not a spoiler.
[3:07:04] <%joylent_blue> BibleThump
[3:07:07] <emperor_z> That zip line was super worth it
[3:07:07] <%Laecerelius> Whelp, time for a double burner!
[3:07:09] <HoIlywood_SN> Patrick Seitz?
[3:07:09] <Mendin> Deliver t he Doctor?
[3:07:10] <FutaSnek> YEA FUCK THE ASEXUAL WORLD

[3:07:15] <%DrWolpertinger> Pizza up a Zip line
[3:07:15] <Mister_McDerp> that child is going to be a BB
[3:07:17] <auspiciousdgg> BibleThump
[3:07:17] <HoIlywood_SN> i think thats Patrick Seitz' voice
[3:07:17] <LunarRemix> Wait, pregnant women shouldn't have antibiotics.
[3:07:25] <%Animorphimagi> SOMEONE
[3:07:29] <djFishmonger> why would you raise a child in this world
[3:07:31] <%TheMilhouseExperience> Keep her away from Paige
[3:07:33] <%wookie5358> he connected to her network
[3:07:39] <HyperBomb21> @AngriestPat because you can't trasnport everything through the network
[3:07:39] <42nfl19> Even then medicine can't be 3d printed I think
[3:07:41] <ThatOneGuyYouSaw> keep that sad shit to yourself, yo
[3:07:42] <TheSandmanIsHere> Oh god, not another quest written by Shinzo Abe
[3:07:44] <Mastigias> "I'd rather see my wife and child DIE before connecting up!"
[3:07:45] <%StaceMcGate> SAM

[3:08:05] <zenith0111> @j_papa Killing them without cutting the chord releases chiral energy and creates more clouds/BTs fields. At least that's what I think. So I've been using No.1 ex grenades to make them move
[3:08:06] <red_blaster> Woolie is not going to make a single zipline and he's going to hate this chapter

[3:09:23] <HoIlywood_SN> @thenumber5point5 a mountain which gets lots of snow in a setting where snow ages you into an old mummy as it falls seems like a terrible idea
[3:09:24] <spicy_2na> Is the mountaineer fuckin Rip Torn?
[3:09:25] <+hero346> Okay we got 5 mins
[3:09:27] <TheSandmanIsHere> @thenumber5point5 and then the low pop areas start blowing up because there's nobody to cremate you in time

[3:11:45] <%king_wragles> @Dr_Mooose you're plugged in!
[3:11:45] <mayorrev> looks like you need to upload your controller to the Chiral Network
[3:11:47] <+NitronStreams> CONNECT YOUR STRAND
[3:11:49] <%MalekDracarus> Im the opposite on that regard
[3:11:49] <+hero346> Damn i thought he disconnected
[3:11:52] <%Doomcoder> charging cord is a strand, your controller is on the beach, and we are all BTs waiting to consume content
[3:11:54] <%LiquidShake83> streams over
[3:11:55] <Mister_McDerp> wired > wireless
[3:11:57] <+hero346> Online wise
[3:12:01] <valriot> @angriestpat I got Edgewise. The best part? It's not even really good honestly
[3:12:01] <%Alpha8087> Streams watched Vs controller issues, now up to 3/5. Nice!
[3:12:03] <%TheMilhouseExperience> Your controller wasn’t stranded
[3:12:03] <HoIlywood_SN> CONNECT YOUR CHIRAL CONTROLLER TO THE STRAND SYSTEM FOR UNLIMITED BATTERY
[3:12:06] <%IllusiveFish> Randys wasn't hard to grind out with moentum control and a Jade Rabbit
[3:12:11] <%neodeltai> Make the controller WHOLE
[3:12:11] <%J_Papa> Yeah i had to grind Edgewise in public areas outside a Nightfall, it was grueling
[3:12:15] <%thenumber5point5> ya edgewise took forever, ended up loading in to a nightfall in titan and farming kills in the platform for it
[3:12:17] <%DrWolpertinger> Strand your baby for maximum likes
[3:12:17] <TheSandmanIsHere> imagine if the game didn't pause when this happened
[3:12:18] <ThatOneGuyYouSaw> I bought a mount on WoW that looks to be worth more than $300 nowadays. I wonder if I should sell it or something.
[3:12:19] <Retinolgaming> @doomcoder Turtle beach LUL
[3:12:20] <+hero346> Hey controller, you’re on electricity fire, right now
[3:12:23] <Sprawler14> the first two inventions

[3:12:29] <Dr_Mooose> @king_wragles thanks you?
[3:12:30] <Mister_McDerp> did you plug it in?
[3:12:35] <superd4v3> baby jesus
[3:12:40] <%sovayell> @AngriestPat i probably missed it, but did you ever talk about the fucky situation with the 2b glam gear?
[3:12:41] <HoIlywood_SN> @AngriestPat your controller is now part of the chiral network
[3:12:42] <Sprawler14> the charging rope and the controller stick
[3:12:43] <%Alpha8087> You prob dont need me, but if you ever need another tank in an 8 man, holla!
[3:12:43] <Wan6Saber> yay jennLOL
[3:12:50] <TheSandmanIsHere> Sam's battery charged, Pat's battery empty
[3:12:51] <startstoprepeat> edgewise grind with the menagerie mg and the power ammo daily rotator on strikes ain't so bad
[3:12:56] <Nested_Dreams> The controller needs to get onto the chiral network
[3:12:56] <DesuDesuDokiDoki> are you gonna build more roads pat?
[3:12:56] <%Meow0369> what? what happened

[3:13:29] <mayorrev> F
[3:13:31] <cheesedburgers> Does her chest piece still make you white
[3:13:32] <zenith0111> I can't believe Kojima said killing BTs has consequences but the game never tells you what cantaS
[3:13:34] <%StaceMcGate> SPEAK LADY
[3:13:35] <%thenumber5point5> mostly asked about undying mind to see what you think of how the season ended with a text box and wasted build up
[3:13:35] <%sovayell> rolling a 97 is still only like a 40ish % chance of getting it
[3:13:43] <%sovayell> so just get lucky and roll a 99
[3:13:44] <FutaSnek> BB TIME
[3:13:44] <%Alpha8087> ...Thats an odd term.
[3:13:46] <DesuDesuDokiDoki> yay a stillmother!
[3:13:46] <%Doomcoder> put that funky fetus in a BB pod!
[3:13:46] <Mister_McDerp> silent background lady

[3:13:49] <Graxe_> So then she gives birth to a BB?
[3:13:50] <%TDAWS_MP132> then she'll be a still mom!
[3:13:50] <rufus2k2> >bioprinter
[3:13:52] <rufus2k2> ?
[3:13:53] <+Punchasaur> Tubey
[3:13:53] <%GarbageNirvana> New BB, bonus
[3:13:53] <Gruntini> Oh no, she's going to become a smash player!
[3:13:57] <+goldfingers16> this mission took me 28 mins, je did it in less than 5. I will build ziplines all over the map
[3:13:57] <CSeriesJTYPE> why they didnt just make it a quest reward is beyond me
[3:13:59] <ThatOneGuyYouSaw> @zenith0111 we'll find out once the nuke counter hits 0
[3:14:03] <%SlashHabit> brain dead, than she'll fart out a handy tool for the husband
[3:14:06] <+Punchasaur> 2B Maguire
[3:14:08] <+silvery_cricket> Such a good doctor he wont even bother to go and see a patient

[3:14:20] <%DrWolpertinger> He's got... Siatica
[3:14:24] <%WhereIsWill> they should've just made it a damn quest reward!
[3:14:26] <TheSandmanIsHere> sperm tubes are the future
[3:14:26] <%StaceMcGate> Can you buy cosmetic items like 2B gear in FF14 or is it only a raid reward?
[3:14:26] <mayorrev> yeah pat dont break it
[3:14:28] <+D00msDayDan> oh yeah, viruses technically aren't alive
[3:14:33] <SpaceGuntank> 3D Printing Vaccines! PogChamp
[3:14:35] <Sprawler14> hey whys a doctor living in the middle of fucking nowhere instead of, like, a populated city?
[3:14:37] <+silvery_cricket> What a scumbag go to your patient and care for them scumbag
[3:14:39] <+NotMySammich> yeet the fuck out of that equipment
[3:14:50] <rufus2k2> DON'T TELL ME WHAT I CAN OR CAN'T DO! LOCKE DOT JAYPEG
[3:14:50] <carbon458> need a bath Sam
[3:14:53] <Mister_McDerp> if viruses aren't alive are they BTs
[3:14:56] <%wookie5358> that's a fine balance to walk in MMOs. you're right, but chance systems give that dopamine @CSeriesJTYPE
[3:15:06] <%CrabSlacks> sam needs another shower with deadman
[3:15:08] <DesuDesuDokiDoki> strong bridge
[3:15:10] <ThatOneGuyYouSaw> @carbon458 But Lambdert, I-
[3:15:10] <%DrWolpertinger> use the printer to beat mules to grab
[3:15:15] <zenith0111> @thatoneguyyousaw On PC that will never happen. Ps4 and Xbox have a chance. Pc players cheated out thousands of nukes when Ps4 barely had 100
[3:15:15] <auspiciousdgg> $10 says Pat tumbles down a hill and destroys it
[3:15:16] <+D00msDayDan> @silvery_cricket yeah just climb that mountain full of ghosts old man
[3:15:20] <%nofestu2> I want my bb back
[3:15:24] <+Punchasaur> Yeah viruses don’t have cells so they don’t actually meet the qualifications for being considered living things
[3:15:25] <TheSandmanIsHere> gotta keep the MMO players locked in their skinner boxes
[3:15:29] <+silvery_cricket> No Sam should bring the doctor to his patient
[3:15:30] <%StaceMcGate> bb back ribs, barberque sauce

[3:19:46] <%StaceMcGate> blah blah blah JOIN NETWORK
[3:19:47] <rufus2k2> @zenith0111 in Lord of the Rings if you look closely Legolas walks on top of the snow instead of sinking into it
[3:19:48] <Sprawler14> is she barely holding on by a strand
[3:19:50] <$KnivesEve> wait real question, cant the water be drank after it hits something?

[3:19:56] <zenith0111> Pokemon did do what I thought it should've done a long time ago and fixed it's dumb pvp metas
[3:20:00] <ThatOneGuyYouSaw> alright, alright, I didn't ask for your life story.
[3:20:08] <%wookie5358> he would die when going into a safe room @J_Papa
[3:20:10] <%nofestu2> this guy sounds like he says"Whoa Nelly" alot
[3:20:16] <DesuDesuDokiDoki> dirty sam
[3:20:21] <%thenumber5point5> @herotoxiko not going to argue they cut out a lot and it feels like a much smaller game, but it's not the trash fire people are treating it as, just doesn't have the post game legs the past games did
[3:20:27] <Dr_Mooose> @KnivesEve yes, but why would you want to drink water

[3:20:35] <Sprawler14> sam how do face get so dirty but hair stay so clean
[3:20:35] <%Alpha8087> God watch this fuckin game make you build this network then near the end of the game its like 'oh we gotta take it down go back to the stops' or some tedious crap
[3:20:38] <Dr_Mooose> shit's gross
[3:20:41] <%StaceMcGate> @AngriestPat Does the repetition of scenes and dialogue with connecting people annoy you at all?
[3:20:42] <valriot> Sams like "Birth your stinky kid"
[3:20:42] <%TheMilhouseExperience> Wait until you see his wife. You will have questions.
[3:20:44] <Mendin> no its ok mama and mamasister fixed it
[3:20:46] <spicy_2na> That Mountaineer really looks like Rip Torn
[3:20:59] <Mister_McDerp> then why do they act so fucking evil?
[3:21:00] <auspiciousdgg> The guy sees Sam all bloody and shit and is like "Get us on the network, we'll join the UCA, please just don't kill us"
[3:21:04] <%Engwithan_Elder_God> Who would be against Human Instrumentality? Terrorists, that's who.
[3:21:06] <valriot> Bullshit, Higgs probably LOVES that shit
[3:21:08] <rufus2k2> @zenith0111 I think it' mentioned in the novels and probably bled over into D&D as well

[3:23:36] <+ClaudeMcGarren> @thetruenicster it was turning into a fully human baby cause of sam so deadman had to basically reset the baby stop it from "bricking" actual term he used lol
[3:23:36] <Sprawler14> get the latest baby firmware

[3:24:15] <TheSandmanIsHere> build them gloves
[3:24:16] <%StaceMcGate> Pat zipline-shames other players
[3:24:19] <AMaidIndeed> line of sight?
[3:24:22] <Bigyin396> because it's the highest point and can connect to both sides of the mountain
[3:24:24] <+ClaudeMcGarren> @thetruenicster then he pushed sam in the shower and talked about how bbs were banned before and the current president brought them back and that they are being watched das what you missed
[3:24:30] <%thenumber5point5> range is hard in this area
[3:24:31] <DesuDesuDokiDoki> make a rope that leads up to it
[3:24:32] <%TDAWS_MP132> apatHoldon
[3:24:35] <Mister_McDerp> delete it?
[3:24:36] <SpaceGuntank> these people cant build ziplines worth a shit
[3:24:37] <%marvel877> Probably made sense in there game. Remember, not everything pops up in your game.
[3:24:42] <Dr_Mooose> just add a rope near
[3:24:43] <zenith0111> Yeah you want you ziplines to be on top of the mountains for better vantage points
[3:24:44] <%wookie5358> your convenience isn't convenient enough for pat
[3:24:45] <Bigyin396> Needs some ladders
[3:24:49] <%Doomcoder> there's an achievement for jumping from here
[3:24:50] <%sovayell> earn your zip pat
[3:24:51] <+D00msDayDan> ladder that bitch
[3:24:53] <zenith0111> Seems hard Kappa

[3:25:04] <waifoong98> BIG doodBigBrain
[3:25:05] <reonome> give it a like
[3:25:05] <%wookie5358> lrn2zip
[3:25:06] <%bevyrage> a couple of ladders would fix that climb easy
[3:25:06] <mayorrev> DISMANTLE
[3:25:06] <tiaramaki> Could you put a rope down at all?
[3:25:09] <+G_Thunders> It’s a relay point
[3:25:10] <munchkay> rope
[3:25:10] <rufus2k2> this game feels like a permanent rassum frassum goldang friggin mode
[3:25:10] <black_pariah> needs to connect to the other side
[3:25:10] <shogunomega> I don't care Pat get my stadia console here on time

[3:25:20] <%GarbageNirvana> It keeps clear of obstacles at least
[3:25:25] <%juxtest> Now the prch belongs to Pat
[3:25:25] <auspiciousdgg> Poor widdle baby Pat can't walk 45 second in a video game
[3:25:25] <%TheMilhouseExperience> I guess the all terrain skeleton is useless after all.
[3:25:27] <%Mitalis> then put one down near the Mountaineers place so you can zip up and down to that one.
[3:25:27] <$HeroToxiko> @thenumber5point5 but the "totally not a digimon" bunny starter just has the functionality protean greninja had, and koffing has that cute victorian look so im struggling

[3:25:30] <%Doomcoder> Free to Destroy
[3:25:33] <Bigyin396> I don't think it's supposed to be used as a starting one, it's supposed to be a mid point in the network
[3:25:34] <faldin> piss off the mountain
[3:25:38] <ScrubTheNerd> Yeah when the point of the zipline is to be easily accessible, putting it there makes no sense

[3:25:53] <$HeroToxiko> @thenumber5point5 thanks for reading my rando ass rant
[3:25:53] <%sovayell> allo nana
[3:25:57] <%Doomcoder> @HeroToxiko Protean is only with the Hidden Ability, which I don't think is available yet
[3:26:01] <+Punchasaur> Death Scrubbing
[3:26:01] <%Jack_of_No_Trades> hi nana
[3:26:02] <%joylent_blue> elmo being naughty
[3:26:05] <@commanderclaw> commanderclaw subscribed at Tier 1. They've subscribed for 22 months, currently on a 22 month streak! Been playing RDR2 on PC, and it's major problems with systems like Crime, Honor, Hunting, movement, make me feel like R* forgot it was making a videogame. Say what you will about Kojima's stories, at least he isn't fighting his own medium.
[3:26:12] <%StaceMcGate> I was in the bathroom, why is the Pat gone?
[3:26:14] <%MalekDracarus> @nana_24 h u l l o
[3:26:19] <mechengineers> elmo tring to burn the housedown?
[3:26:24] <%linSP> that guy probably had ladders in his world that lead to that zipline hat didnt carry over
[3:26:24] <zenith0111> @commanderclaw Damn
[3:26:24] <%TDAWS_MP132> apatGib
[3:26:25] <Bigyin396> Pat is the zipline expert, all shall bow before his superior zipline placement
[3:26:28] <munchkay> hello Nana, hope ya like angry goblin man!
[3:26:32] <%MisterVantes> apatGib apatGib
[3:26:34] <Zaphire_Saucypants> I wouldnt be so quick to dismantle if I were him. That's free bandwidth.
[3:26:34] <$HeroToxiko> @Doomcoder they renamed it and only the bunny starter has it, afaik
[3:26:36] <TheSandmanIsHere> @commanderclaw except for his cutscene fetish
[3:26:57] <%Zamorouskiwhich> Is podracing?
[3:26:58] <blackesteagle> B&E specialist Elmo
[3:26:59] <mechengineers> Elmo: WHATS IN THE BOX?
[3:26:59] <%Doomcoder> @HeroToxiko yes, but it's its Hidden Ability, which is not yet available
[3:27:03] <+NitronStreams> Niw this is podracing
[3:27:14] <zenith0111> @thesandmanishere Hey Kojima makes great movies Kappa
[3:27:14] <%thenumber5point5> @zaphire_saucypants other peoples stuff doesn't use up bandwidth
[3:27:21] <@commanderclaw> @TheSandmanIsHere At least Kojima doesn't have you do tailing missions
[3:27:24] <%Piemen99> yes but actually no
[3:27:24] <HoIlywood_SN> @TheSandmanIsHere i feel like Kojimas reputation for cutscenes is kind of overblown and still based on MGS4, theres a lot sure but other big triple a games are getting fucking ludicrous with them
[3:27:28] <HeroToxiko> @Doomcoder agreed
[3:27:36] <Zaphire_Saucypants> @thenumber5point5 That's why I said it's FREE bandwidth
[3:27:38] <%Mottyrob> Replace road with ziplines
[3:27:42] <Mendin> @HoldBtoRun Kojima literally wants to do movies next
[3:27:44] <%Piemen99> pat is continuing to show us he's a living meme
[3:27:50] <%ThatOneGameTester> holds stuff automatically?
[3:27:53] <shogunomega> This is how it most of looked for the man trying to fix Pats internet
[3:27:53] <HoIlywood_SN> FUCK
[3:27:54] <corpsegoo> I think they make it harder to lose grip
[3:27:55] <zenith0111> @hoilywood_sn MGS4 did set the record for longest cutscenes.
[3:27:55] <%marvel877> Pack a punch and help your grip.

[3:28:00] <Weeabooninja> @HoIlywood_SN The beginning of DS was literally a 2 hour cutscene
[3:28:00] <%aishman> THEY SAID THE THING
[3:28:06] <%StaceMcGate> Kojima doesn't have tailing missions, but 45 minute car rides or has your character sit down while others monologue for an hour
[3:28:11] <%aishman> "I love the Power Glove....It's so bad"
[3:28:12] <Crimpson> All the time

I spent all night writing out a silent hill inspired One-off for my call of Cthulhu tabletop group that has like 12 pages dedicated to just encounters. Then they cancel. should I have a burger or a pizza to make me feel better?
[3:29:52] <tigerfang86> the ULTIMATE POSTMAN
[3:29:53] <munchkay> by the end of the game you're just going to become IronMan
[3:29:56] <zenith0111> Holy shit MGS4 is only 2 hours under DS cutscene lenths
[3:29:58] <tigerfang86> NOTHING can stop him
[3:29:58] <jack_s1n> other way
[3:29:59] <+NotMySammich> Postman Patron
[3:30:14] <%TheMilhouseExperience> That’s actually a good metaphor
[3:30:22] <%Doomcoder> If Kojima were writing it, Iron Man would actually have a suit of iron
[3:30:22] <TheSandmanIsHere> dr. light's latest creation: Post Man
[3:30:22] <%Jack_of_No_Trades> Oh hes using the magic cuff to ride the line. Neat
[3:30:30] <Gruntini> Piss off ghosts!
[3:30:30] <tigerfang86> nice try DORKS
[3:30:38] <Sprawler14> "Sam, this is DiehardMan, you can use your power gloves to maximise the efficiency of your... personal time. Of course, as a repatriate, all of your body fluids are valuable, so make sure to collect anything you produce."
[3:30:39] <%GeneralSCPatton> @the_mental_punk OOF
[3:30:40] <%Doomcoder> wrists of steel because his aphenphosmphobia means he can only jerk off
[3:30:52] <TheSandmanIsHere> I ain't afraid of no ghosts!
[3:30:52] <shogunomega> Sam is trying to get to a magic the gathering meet up
[3:30:54] <Astaroth130> zipline seems op
[3:30:54] <Cristalpufy> woo skipping the game
[3:31:05] <%TheMilhouseExperience> Attention all ghosts! Youse a bitch!
[3:31:11] <tigerfang86> skipping the game? or making it WAY BETTER
[3:31:12] <+DRAGKUDO> so japanese iron man

[3:31:34] <zenith0111> @the_mental_punk F
[3:31:39] <tiaramaki> Why not recycle those boots?
[3:31:39] <FutaSnek> Can we get blood gloves to PUNCH THE SHIT OUTTA GHOSTS?
[3:31:39] <maxpasta> Do you ever unlock moon boots?
[3:31:42] <+chronopaladin> people mad at ziplines should also be mad at dark souls shortcuts I guess
[3:31:44] <%joylent_blue> building shit to skip the game IS the game
[3:31:45] <%wookie5358> if this was fallout 76, those ziplines would cost 100 dollars a year to maintain
[3:32:03] <shogunomega> Is Hugh Jackman in the game too
[3:32:12] <FutaSnek> @wookie5358 And then woudln't work LUL
[3:32:15] <%GeneralSCPatton> It's like golf, but cool. Gotta minimize your time playing.
[3:32:22] <waifoong98> @wookie5358 and a subscription to build it first too LUL
[3:32:27] <TheSandmanIsHere> replace the spare boots with the new better boots
[3:32:33] <maxpasta> @wookie5358 Death Stranding is a better Fallout game than 76 lol
[3:32:37] <+DRAGKUDO> @shogunomega shofuConceited

[3:35:07] <tiaramaki> I totally forgot that Pat had Sam's hat be gold and wondered what the heck kind of jellyfish was on the table
[3:35:08] <%TheMilhouseExperience> Everything in Spherehunters and girlfriend reviews was on point.
[3:35:15] <shogunomega> Hugh Jackedman is to Death Stranding Robocop what is Vergil to Dante
[3:35:19] <Sprawler14> Time for Roads

[3:35:29] <%DrWolpertinger> ITS TIME FOR MONSTER PROFITS
[3:35:39] <Cristalpufy> without the cutscenes this will be very dull

[3:36:37] <shogunomega> Hugh Jackman built more roads for his ghost mother to get stronger like dad

[3:38:23] <MattDemers> Multi-track drifting!
[3:38:27] <flavonoskovitch> In Death Stranding you really FEEL like Norman Reedus - Kotaku
[3:38:28] <waifoong98> Man vs Nature Kappa
[3:38:34] <FutaSnek> mehdiBABY mehdiBABY mehdiBABY mehdiBABY
[3:38:36] <corpsegoo> I wish there was an achievement for completing the roads
[3:38:38] <%xcompleasedad> IT GETS WORSE
[3:38:38] <TheSandmanIsHere> paving over ghosts probably satisfies
[3:38:38] <%the_mental_punk> The worst with the mini cutscenes is drivng on roads and entering BT areas where it does the slow down then does the zoom in everytime at the north mountain station, cosplayer, and south lake.
[3:38:39] <%J_Papa> He just ghosted through a giant rock
[3:38:39] <%joylent_blue> showing nature's who's boss
[3:38:42] <%xcompleasedad> WAY FUCKING WORSE
[3:38:43] <Mister_McDerp> permanent structures are the opposite of consumables
[3:38:51] <%moondog_> GOUTRICK ROADS TAKE ME HOME
[3:38:53] <SpaceGuntank> that shiny gold paintjob is gonna get ruined in the rain FeelsBadMan
[3:38:53] <%StaceMcGate> back for more materials then
[3:38:57] <FutaSnek> pvpBB
[3:39:00] <%TheMilhouseExperience> Two wheel truck driving and downhilling is sick.
[3:39:11] <Mendin> Oh my god the chiral crystals are gout crystals
[3:39:13] <%J_Papa> One of these required a fuckton of materials for me
[3:39:14] <xxafrodragonxx> Gold does not rust
[3:39:17] <Oncamimus> WOAH...pat...was not paying attention...but your truck is fucking gold.......awesome
[3:39:18] <+DRAGKUDO> if someone was to turn off the spoiler stuff in the beginning would it be an entirely different game for them? Like roads would be completely and ziplines would be everywhere?
[3:39:20] <%joylent_blue> oh boy
[3:39:27] <Dr_Mooose> truck it Pat
[3:39:29] <ricotez> did you just almost Austion Powers that truck
[3:39:30] <mayorrev> GOLD TRUCK
[3:39:31] <reasonance> did I miss him meeting heartman?
[3:39:32] <%Alpha8087> Look at this gaudy ass tonka truck
[3:39:37] <zenith0111> There's an oxygen mask in this game and I think it was suppose to be apart of the original designs of the characters rmzTHINK
[3:39:39] <DesuDesuDokiDoki> roads
[3:39:41] <%Tucker0603> @reasonance no
[3:39:41] <Sprawler14> its too late
[3:39:42] <Oncamimus> Gold Truck best truck
[3:39:43] <FutaSnek> @DRAGKUDO Pretty much, ruins the flow tho
[3:39:44] <%nofestu2> sipsipHellmo sipsipHellmo sipsipHellmo
[3:39:46] <%TheMilhouseExperience> Hey it’s that bridge that helped me.
[3:39:46] <%StaceMcGate> Elmo is going crazy
[3:39:49] <%joylent_blue> reasonance no, apparently that's very far away
[3:39:52] <MattDemers> @DRAGKUDO I think you need to connect an area to the network before you can see structures, so people wouldn't see them until they at least did it once themselves.
[3:40:00] <corpsegoo> oxygen mask is way in the future bulllshit
[3:40:00] <shogunomega> Surprised they don't have a giant mech show up yet that you can pilot
[3:40:06] <+DRAGKUDO> oh ok
[3:40:09] <waifoong98> there's no way LUL
[3:40:17] <%TheMilhouseExperience> Run over BTs with your truck
[3:40:24] <%Doomcoder> remember, Sam, this mech is strictly non-lethal!
[3:40:29] <%joylent_blue> get some BT likes
[3:40:31] <MattDemers> Why does Pat always have boots on him? Do you need to replace your own?
[3:40:31] <%moondog_> C'MON C'MON C'MON GOUT TRUCKIN'
[3:40:33] <shogunomega> Yell America while you run them over

[3:40:54] <SpaceGuntank> i wonder if you can "kill" all the BTs in an area and it'll be cleansed like the MULE camps
[3:40:57] <%TheMilhouseExperience> Come and get me ghosts. I’m right here.
[3:40:57] <MattDemers> @joylent_blue Thanks
[3:40:57] <Demon_chann> you mean lou

[3:41:42] <Sokumotanaka> ""Gotta get back my baby." Feeling kind hopeless now, I should of never messed around, you never know what you got till the moment that you lose it, I gotta get back my baby
[3:41:51] <%TheMilhouseExperience> Look there’s a small hill up and down too
[3:41:55] <shogunomega> Yeah bts is a Kpop thing, the people in the game are k pop singers that couldn't be heard internationally
[3:41:55] <%joylent_blue> the Oni is awesome looking
[3:42:02] <%Rumbutt> Getting killer matches on PTB is always a pain

[3:45:22] <%DedlokPM> mogsShook
[3:45:23] <%joylent_blue> WHA- oh
[3:45:24] <@commanderclaw> Ass feathers?
[3:45:24] <jack_s1n> BANG BIGITY BANG
[3:45:27] <%misha_kastrilevich> Why even have weapons when killing people causes more BT's? Aside from Bola Guns
[3:45:27] <HoIlywood_SN> @AngriestPat did you anal vore swallow a bird up your asshole
[3:45:29] <valriot> Did you fuck a chicken????
[3:45:29] <TheSandmanIsHere> but enough about your sex life
[3:45:30] <superd4v3> @AngriestPat balme elmo
[3:45:31] <%BallerSwagBro9k> WUT? cmonBruh
[3:45:40] <shogunomega> all the bead come flopping out
[3:45:41] <Mister_McDerp> use shotgun
[3:45:46] <+G_Thunders> @misha_kastrilevich you have non lethal versions of the weapons
[3:45:46] <ChrisM341> Excuse me Whaaat?
[3:45:50] <Absurd_Lizard> fucked a chicken. nothing wrong with that.
[3:45:53] <zenith0111> @misha_kastrilevich Because lethal weapons do the most damage
[3:45:55] <%WhereIsWill> anal chicken???
[3:45:57] <%TheMilhouseExperience> 2?
[3:46:01] <zenith0111> @misha_kastrilevich On BTs
[3:46:02] <Mendin> Paige took to roleplaying a French Maid with the featherduster a bit too seriously.
[3:46:04] <%StaceMcGate> holy shit, look at how much he is carrying
[3:46:06] <%J_Papa> A Non Lethal Assault Rifle, the most perfectest weapon for dead things
[3:46:07] <%misha_kastrilevich> Ah
[3:46:10] <+jumbey234> Boy got ass feathers
[3:46:10] <superd4v3> @AngriestPat You have a lvl.3 non-lethal rifle I think
[3:46:13] <TheSandmanIsHere> are you just dropping guns in her house now
[3:46:15] <gojirarads> oooooooh pat
[3:46:20] <%Mottyrob> Make BB feel better by potentially increasing the death count
[3:46:21] <%Doomcoder> Pat is turning into the Black Swan
[3:46:26] <%joylent_blue> time to bop some fools
[3:46:34] <%Alpha8087> @AngriestPat you unlocked both at the same time iirc.
[3:46:39] <shogunomega> Dude, Sam on Pats play through looks like a douche
[3:46:40] <shogunomega> lol
[3:46:54] <%J_Papa> Can't kill what's already dead, therefore use non-lethal weaponry
[3:46:55] <%joylent_blue> shogunomega you know it
[3:46:56] <djFishmonger> I really want there to be a mission where you deliver a gun, then the dude proceeds to off himself on the spot. Then you gotta take care of the corpse
[3:47:02] <Mendin> That was the intent
[3:47:06] <TheSandmanIsHere> they are now
[3:47:09] <Mister_McDerp> but are they?
[3:47:14] <zenith0111> I think Pats Backpack cover has been rekt'd for a while now
[3:47:22] <%Alpha8087> Huh! I saw both normal and MULE postboxes on the map
[3:47:22] <%radda343> they're mules that fell for higg's bullshit
[3:47:31] <superd4v3> @Mister_McDerp They're HIgg's men
[3:47:32] <+D00msDayDan> no they're still homo demens
[3:47:32] <Mendin> MULEmo Demons
[3:47:34] <TheSandmanIsHere> hell if I know, I'm just guessing
[3:47:41] <+talon84> Postman Pat on the job!
[3:47:42] <%J_Papa> Pat forgot about armor
[3:47:45] <%StaceMcGate> Any particular reason only humans cause void outs?
[3:47:47] <LunarRemix> Isn't it suicidal of them to use real guns?
[3:47:55] <djFishmonger> @StaceMcGate humans have souls
[3:47:56] <corpsegoo> fortunately the incinerator isn't too far away if anyone does get murdered
[3:47:58] <valriot> They think Voidouts look cool
[3:48:02] <%TheMilhouseExperience> They were always mules. I wasn’t listening
[3:48:04] <Mendin> Only sentient sapient beings have the Beach and a concept of afterlife
[3:48:07] <shogunomega> Does Sam lay in his own poop like pigs to be safe?
[3:48:07] <+Edrem> The incinerator is close to these guys, so they don't care
[3:48:09] <Demon_chann> damn homo demens
[3:48:09] <%J_Papa> No they're terrorists, they use voidouts as bombs
[3:48:14] <+NotMySammich> postman pat goes a ratatat tat
[3:48:14] <Mister_McDerp> they're terrorists, they don't care
[3:48:16] <%Laecerelius> The terrorists LOVE voidouts
[3:48:16] <Storm_Samurai> @LunarRemix what do you mean suicidal
[3:48:16] <ShichiNoBushi> MULEs in the other areas also use handguns now. But they are all also terrorists in the mountain half of the map.
[3:48:17] <%StaceMcGate> @djFishmonger So souls are real and visibly through science?
[3:48:18] <%linSP> its da demins
[3:48:25] <%Maids4lyfe> they are suicidal, they purposefully use dead bodies to destroy cities
[3:48:25] <Mendin> Yep
[3:48:26] <corpsegoo> but since they are terrorists, they're more interested in using the bodies they make as bombs for cities
[3:48:29] <CALLthaDoctah> So when someone dies real bad shit happens in the world right
[3:48:30] <Flarepulse> what if they just commandeer a crematorium so they can kill people safely Kappa
[3:48:32] <Mister_McDerp> suicide bombers are a thing after all
[3:48:33] <TheSandmanIsHere> dogs are all good boys and girls, so they just go straight to Heaven
[3:48:34] <+G_Thunders> Well if they’re Higg’s guys they might know who you are, and that you cant die
[3:48:35] <KasiCrafter> Likes are THAT important. Worth getting nuked to make number go up.
[3:48:35] <djFishmonger> @StaceMcGate Seems like it. same thing with the AFterlife in this universe
[3:48:36] <zenith0111> @stacemcgate There's been so many misconceptions I've seen about voidouts. They're caused when Big BTs swallow Humans and make them touch their antimatter on the inside causing a "Voidout"
[3:48:56] <Mendin> When someone dies, within 48hr their corpse turns into a ghost, and that ghost can antimatter pop other humans
[3:48:59] <zenith0111> Anti-matter bombs are made from big BTs.
[3:49:04] <TheSandmanIsHere> @zenith0111 they're also caused when a corpse sits around too long
[3:49:06] <%TheMilhouseExperience> Play like John wick!
[3:49:15] <shogunomega> Has anyone made a Sam Paige with a bearded bb (Pat) ?
[3:49:23] <%Laecerelius> Time to not murder!
[3:49:23] <%Alpha8087> Time for da gun
[3:49:24] <%Divryne> LOL GOOD LUCK HIDING.
[3:49:26] <CALLthaDoctah> Can you kill people in this game?
[3:49:28] <zenith0111> @thesandmanishere Nope that's the biggest misconception I've seen that's been getting more traction
[3:49:29] <%StaceMcGate> parry that ping
[3:49:31] <%J_Papa> @zenith0111 this is where i lose track, why would ALL dead bodies be a problem then?
[3:49:35] <djFishmonger> Do we know yet what caused the inital Death Stranding?
[3:49:35] <Mister_McDerp> KILL EM ALL SAM
[3:49:35] <%Divryne> Yah you can kill everyone.
[3:49:38] <%TheMilhouseExperience> Throw packages at them, they hate it.
[3:49:39] <+JavaManJoJo> @Mendin I think it's even more strict than that, which I think gets explained in scene a bit further ahead than Pat if I remember/understood correctly.
[3:49:41] <%GarbageNirvana> Totally can't see that moving stack of packages no sir
[3:49:47] <corpsegoo> aparently you can do murder, you just gotta make sure you incinerate the bodies
[3:49:52] <TheSandmanIsHere> this is a sneaking mission
[3:49:52] <%Laecerelius> kill them all and then kill their souls!
[3:49:54] <%Divryne> Everytime you kill someone they become a ticking timenuke.
[3:49:55] <%Doomcoder> BTs happen when corpses lie around for too long. so that's only step 1
[3:49:56] <zenith0111> @j_papa Because they attract and create more BTs
[3:49:56] <+trustycoyote> lol
[3:49:56] <%StaceMcGate> Camo Index 98%
[3:49:56] <Mendin> @JavaManJoJo This is based on what we have learned so far, for the most part
[3:49:58] <corpsegoo> or cause a big void out
[3:50:02] <shogunomega> The packages....they are coming
[3:50:02] <%Laecerelius> DOUBLE MURDER! DOUBLE MURDER!
[3:50:04] <Mister_McDerp> must've been the wind
[3:50:06] <+earthboy2k> All dead bodies turn into BTs
[3:50:07] <CALLthaDoctah> Yeesh
[3:50:08] <%Divryne> RUSH B.
[3:50:11] <%Divryne> SHOOT EM ALL.
[3:50:12] <shogunomega> Stop packages
[3:50:12] <%itschickenscratch> itschickenscratch subscribed at Tier 1. They've subscribed for 8 months! yo pat did you know roads you've finished past the first 3 wont show up in other players games, i did some extensive testing a couple days ago
[3:50:13] <xbb1024> !uptime
[3:50:14] <@Moobot> I've been playing this game for how long? Oh only 3h 50m.
[3:50:16] <valriot> Three LUL LUL LUL
[3:50:17] <%joylent_blue> i've seen people reporting that the game softlocks when they try to burn a body
[3:50:20] <+wjones0415> are those bees?
[3:50:22] <zenith0111> @j_papa More BTs equal higher chance for voidouts
[3:50:25] <munchkay> PUNCH THEM!!!
[3:50:27] <Mister_McDerp> boom headshot
[3:50:34] <+trustycoyote> Hey chat... Likes are basically exp right?
[3:50:39] <zenith0111> Which is why Nukes in this setting are extra fucked up
[3:50:42] <%GarbageNirvana> Basically
[3:50:44] <shogunomega> The guy get up and is like..."Cmon man"
[3:50:46] <%Doomcoder> apparently, dropping a body in the tar also prevents it from BTing, just like incinerating it
[3:50:47] <%xcompleasedad> @trustycoyote Yes
[3:50:49] <SpaceGuntank> "Huh? What was that noise?"
[3:50:51] <%Alpha8087> Gottem
[3:50:56] <%StaceMcGate> "Must of been the wind"
[3:50:56] <Dr_Mooose> oh that is more than 3
[3:50:57] <%TheMilhouseExperience> Doorway
[3:51:01] <%Laecerelius> kick him, Pat!
[3:51:02] <Mister_McDerp> yoink
[3:51:05] <xbb1024> where in the story is Pat up to?
[3:51:09] <TheSandmanIsHere> steal their ceramics too

[3:51:21] <+DiabloDeAzul> you can put away the weapon to run faster
[3:51:23] <Mendin> @xbb1024 mid-chapter deadman
[3:51:30] <FutaSnek> YOU DUMB MOTHERFUCKERS
[3:51:30] <Mister_McDerp> haha what a bunch of losers
[3:51:32] <shogunomega> Quick use the packages to save yourself
[3:51:33] <Meta_Four> @xbb1024 Chapter 6: Deadman
[3:51:35] <%J_Papa> @zenith0111 i think the opening made it seem like every dead body is 100% going to make a crater within 48 hours, but if you leave a corpse around it just becomes a BT
[3:51:36] <%Alpha8087> Punked
[3:51:37] <%CrabSlacks> just getting shot nbd
[3:51:37] <Alzero83> Coward!!!
[3:51:42] <DesuDesuDokiDoki> nice
[3:51:42] <+trustycoyote> Ok so my question is.... what happens in like a year or when there's not as many people playing.... are you just fucked on game progression?
[3:51:42] <%joylent_blue> try to keep up with my ALL TERRAIN SKELETON
[3:51:44] <katocrimson> joseph joestar technique
[3:51:45] <+NotMySammich> Joestar secret technique
[3:51:59] <corpsegoo> that bt if in a mule camp, will make a void out
[3:52:00] <Dr_Mooose> as Sam digs bullets from his arm
[3:52:02] <superd4v3> @AngriestPat Joestar Secert Technique
[3:52:03] <%Doomcoder> @trustycoyote fewer shards, same number of people per shard
[3:52:03] <Mendin> I'm su re the shards will get condesed
[3:52:06] <shogunomega> Pat, I think they stopped lol
[3:52:06] <%TheMilhouseExperience> Just hit them with your van. They’ll just get knocked unconscious.
[3:52:07] <%StaceMcGate> music time
[3:52:07] <waifoong98> oohhh more music
[3:52:07] <thetruenicster> F VOD Time
[3:52:09] <Alzero83> When do you unlock the Metal Gear?
[3:52:09] <+paladinstarbuster> NIGERUNDAYO
[3:52:10] <djFishmonger> @trustycoyote Nah, just gotta farm and make em yourself
[3:52:11] <%Alpha8087> God that sounds like a Stand power
[3:52:12] <TheSandmanIsHere> @trustycoyote probably. should have been an early adopter!
[3:52:14] <Mister_McDerp> you'll never catch me once I use MAXIMUM OVERDRIVE
[3:52:15] <zenith0111> @j_papa I didn't get that from thw cutscene at all. Like then Igor wouldn't have shot his friend or himself if that were true.
[3:52:15] <%Laecerelius> The terrorists are fucking WEAK and have no sick robot skeletons!
[3:52:16] <%BurningLlama777> Music yaaay
[3:52:20] <%Meow0369> music for no reason
[3:52:21] <corpsegoo> eh, it's entirely doable without online
[3:52:22] <valriot> Does their corpse count as all terrain?
[3:52:25] <%Divryne> MUSICS.
[3:52:26] <%DrFacilier> This sounds like a song that'd be in Juno
[3:52:26] <FutaSnek> OH SHIT THIS ONES IN THE GAME
[3:52:33] <FutaSnek> I FUCKIN LOVE THIS SONG
[3:52:33] <Demon_chann> nice music
[3:52:34] <%TheMilhouseExperience> All terrain skeleton. On flat ground. Feels bad.
[3:52:35] <Ipsenscastle> the game chooses some weird moments for music
[3:52:37] <SpaceGuntank> RIP VOD
[3:52:40] <Mendin> @Alzero83 Mini Geckos are delivery drones so kinda
[3:52:41] <Plugman86> Half of the Low Roar's discog is just in this game
[3:52:44] <%cureneckbeard> All-terrain Skeleton DA NA NA NA NA NAAAAAaa
[3:52:45] <+NitronStreams> COUNTRY ROOOOOADS
[3:52:46] <ChrisM341> Raindrops keep falling on my head
[3:52:50] <%thenumber5point5> their goes the vod
[3:52:52] <corpsegoo> I was well past chapter six before I first put my game online
[3:52:53] <zenith0111> @j_papa If what you're saying is true then why kill yourself Instead?
[3:52:53] <Lutre> comfy tune
[3:52:53] <Demon_chann> oh shit this is good
[3:52:54] <+NitronStreams> TAKE ME HOOOOME
[3:52:56] <%joylent_blue> i imagine there will be community organized events like the "Return to ___" events in the souls community
[3:53:00] <%StaceMcGate> WITH A REBEL YELL,SHE CRIED MORE MORE MORE
[3:53:03] <Dr_Mooose> this is a nice little moment
[3:53:03] <%J_Papa> @zenith0111 yeah that's why i was confused, everyone talks like every dead body will voidout but its only a possibility they can't predict, i think i'm square now
[3:53:03] <shogunomega> *sprains ankle, this song plays*
[3:53:04] <+NitronStreams> TO THE PLACE
[3:53:04] <ALTRNico> the fuck is this Life is Strange shit
[3:53:06] <%GarbageNirvana> This is a chill song
[3:53:09] <+NitronStreams> I BELONG
[3:53:13] <TheSandmanIsHere> @themilhouseexperience it said "all terrain," not "all terrain except flat land"
[3:53:21] <+trustycoyote> Ah ok... so the online feature is more novel rather than critical to game progression. Not necessary but make building things way easier.
[3:53:32] <+RayDaug> when's the part where we clap and yell "Hey!"
[3:53:33] <corpsegoo> pretty much
[3:53:34] <%CrabSlacks> "this is my mom's camera, wtf"
[3:53:34] <TheSandmanIsHere> kind of a nier feel right now
[3:53:35] <HyperBomb21> yeah
[3:53:35] <+NitronStreams> WEST VIRGINIA
[3:53:37] <Zaphire_Saucypants> make sure to read some of this area's emails
[3:53:37] <Demon_chann> whats the song name i missed
[3:53:40] <HyperBomb21> it would have to be
[3:53:41] <waifoong98> ruined LUL
[3:53:43] <shogunomega> Kojima is one weird M*ther F*cker
[3:53:45] <Mister_McDerp> bye song
[3:53:45] <Meta_Four> I thought voidouts were only caused by BTs grabbing living people?
[3:53:46] <Zaphire_Saucypants> they provide context regarding the death Stranding
[3:53:48] <zenith0111> @j_papa The big cutscene at the beginning has a LOT going on LUL so I don't blame people didn't realize what the process was
[3:53:49] <maxpasta> Weird it’s full of old man nudes?
[3:53:50] <Mendin> I mean now that the twins have fused, we have Mountain (knot) Mama
[3:53:51] <waifoong98> St erikplans I think @Demon_chann
[3:53:51] <%TheMilhouseExperience> 1 of 2
[3:53:52] <TheSandmanIsHere> a ruined world, but it's still beautiful and the music is chill
[3:53:57] <Ipsenscastle> @Demon_chann st eriksplan
[3:54:00] <%Alpha8087> A PAIGE APPEAR
[3:54:01] <%misha_kastrilevich> PAIGE
[3:54:03] <SpaceGuntank> i was half expecting her to say "this is the wrong camera"
[3:54:08] <valriot> @trustycoyote I mean the online stuff is basically the entire point of the game, that your weight isn't your own, you and every other played shares the load
[3:54:08] <Demon_chann> @waifoong98 @Ipsenscastle thanks
[3:54:09] <%DrFacilier> now i can take pics of rocks for my deep instagram posts
[3:54:13] <Lutre> BB got back
[3:54:13] <shogunomega> Peach came for the feathers
[3:54:14] <+trustycoyote> A wild Paige appears!

[3:54:15] <%StaceMcGate> I want my bb back, bb back, bb back
[3:54:15] <%skizzuto> apatPorgmo apatPorgmo apatPorgmo
[3:54:16] <lethallylactic> monkaS
[3:54:18] <%sovayell> right im dozing off here across the pond, gnight all o/
[3:54:19] <waifoong98> @Demon_chann np
[3:54:28] <%Engwithan_Elder_God> Elmo about to create a voidout.
[3:54:30] <%joylent_blue> sovayell have a good one apatDab
[3:54:38] <%TheMilhouseExperience> Adorable rage
[3:54:40] <Mister_McDerp> what is she gonna take pictures of? Her bunker?
[3:54:46] <TheSandmanIsHere> @valriot it's like the last episode of Cowboy Bebop
[3:54:51] <Zaphire_Saucypants> Like I'll say it again, just in case you didnt' see, but a lot emails for the mountain area preppers provide context for the Death Stranding event.
[3:54:51] <%Alpha8087> Elmo gonna voidout that courch warranty
[3:54:53] <%Laecerelius> Bring your family to the horrible ghost nuke show!
[3:54:54] <TheSandmanIsHere> you're gonna carry that weight
[3:55:01] <corpsegoo> aparently she takes pictures of cave paintings found in the local mountains
[3:55:09] <%Alpha8087> couch warranty rather but that works too, whatever I meant that
[3:55:09] <zenith0111> Trust me it gets way more confusing once you find a certain interview with a special someone. That explains the events leading up to the Death Stranding.
[3:55:11] <Mister_McDerp> shes talking about the strata
[3:55:11] <corpsegoo> if I remember right
[3:55:12] <Mastigias> WHy the claws?!
[3:55:12] <%Alpha8087> NOT FOR PUNCHING
[3:55:13] <%joylent_blue> jesus
[3:55:16] <%TheMilhouseExperience> Why is this old lady here? She never speaks.
[3:55:21] <%Piemen99> IT WAS MADE FOR PUNCHING
[3:55:23] <%StaceMcGate> looks like something from Metal Gear rising
[3:55:24] <Guardiansaiyan> Death Stranding for MCU
[3:55:24] <42nfl19> No punch
[3:55:25] <shogunomega> Yes Pat, the lore of Hugh Jackedman
[3:55:27] <waifoong98> Claws to climb mountain obiously Kappa
[3:55:30] <%Laecerelius> I'm guessing the old lady is her mom
[3:55:36] <+JavaManJoJo> They're HIKING claws chat >:(
[3:55:36] <%oktavia_von> that'll be great for making pulled pork
[3:55:39] <+LtSergei> it's so bad
[3:55:42] <%Doomcoder> you know, I naively assumed that there might be less ghost magic using those things now that Lockne patched them. but no
[3:55:43] <Guardiansaiyan> NINTENDO is suing soon
[3:55:49] <%StaceMcGate> We got Oregon back folks!
[3:55:50] <%Valdorick> Its so bad
[3:55:55] <%Alpha8087> Roit shotgun!
[3:55:55] <Mastigias> SHOTGUN

[3:56:13] <corpsegoo> right now the goal is more ghost bullshit so we can get Lou back
[3:56:18] <%TheMilhouseExperience> There’s an even more stupid weapon later.
[3:56:18] <+trustycoyote> I really want Sam to get so many pieces of armor that he just becomes a Mechwarrior
[3:56:20] <%Laecerelius> Shoot them all, Sam! Shoot them all!
[3:56:20] <PirateMike_> Thats the oldest old woman that ever oldered
[3:56:22] <%Typhaeon> Nicholas Winding Pretense

[3:56:50] <%TheMilhouseExperience> Are you ready to meet heart man soon.
[3:56:53] <AMaidIndeed> does Heartman have DOOMS?
[3:56:54] <+Fonzies_Jacket> xenoBrain
[3:56:56] <Mendin> How the fuck was Heartman sciencing us at the start of the game if he has a garbage connection
[3:56:57] <wannabemoogle> so?
[3:56:58] <%GarbageNirvana> Cause spider webs are strands
[3:57:03] <TheSandmanIsHere> wouldn't the timefall have thrown off dating?
[3:57:07] <%J_Papa> Yes Heartman has DOOMS
[3:57:08] <%Laecerelius> Neaderthals in America?

[3:57:32] <%skizzuto> apatPorgmo apatGib apatPorgmo
[3:57:34] <%Meow0369> Elmo is interrupting a serious lore dump
[3:57:35] <TheSandmanIsHere> Vandal Savage strikes again!
[3:57:35] <mayorrev> ELMO
[3:57:35] <FutaSnek> JUST FUCK THE STORY
[3:57:37] <%BurningLlama777> Ohhhhhh maaaaan
[3:57:38] <wannabemoogle> Elmo demands seat
[3:57:41] <%BurningLlama777> The Big Five
[3:57:44] <Zaphire_Saucypants> important lore
[3:57:50] <%Divryne> Death Stranding killed dinos confirmed
[3:57:54] <%GarbageNirvana> Elmo's had enough of Kojima's bullshit
[3:57:56] <shogunomega> Heartman is on Pats old Internet provider
[3:57:59] <Flarepulse> the Big Five, like in Yugioh
[3:58:01] <%Doomcoder> "These people drew a dolphin but couldn't have seen a dolphin, so they must have been painting a GHOST of a dolphin, so there must have been many other Death Strandings"
[3:58:04] <%Animorphimagi> YUP
[3:58:09] <%Doomcoder> all this based off a dolphin
[3:58:12] <%Doomcoder> OH MY GOD
[3:58:16] <wannabemoogle> Dinosaurs died from ghosts
[3:58:16] <%Doomcoder> it wasn't an asteroid, it was a voidout
[3:58:18] <%TheMilhouseExperience> No hooman it is MY spot now
[3:58:19] <%BurningLlama777> @Doomcoder I don't know, that sounds like flawless logic. 8)
[3:58:20] <%Jack_of_No_Trades> The Great Dying was a Death Stranding
[3:58:21] <HeroToxiko> Thats what the 5 figures are
[3:58:21] <TheSandmanIsHere> where are the dinosaur ghosts
[3:58:21] <Psyramics> THEN WHERE ARE THE DINOSAUR GHOSTS
[3:58:21] <Mister_McDerp> there were WAY more than five extinctions
[3:58:24] <black_pariah> thats not what he said at all pat
[3:58:26] <Ipsenscastle> dinosaurs were killed by ghost dolphins
[3:58:29] <lethallylactic> Dinosaur ghosts monkaS
[3:58:29] <%Meow0369> No a death stranding seems to be just a name for them
[3:58:29] <%oktavia_von> sounds like a jojo plot
[3:58:32] <mayorrev> LUL
[3:58:32] <EsotericOdyssey> god this is dumb
[3:58:33] <wannabemoogle> oh fucking hell
[3:58:33] <%Divryne> apatDab
[3:58:34] <%Laecerelius> So each of the God Hands caused an extinction level event?
[3:58:34] <Oncamimus> GREAT DYING WAS INSANE
[3:58:35] <%joylent_blue> does that mean that dinosaurs have SOULS?
[3:58:35] <%Typhaeon> What did you expect LuL
[3:58:36] <waifoong98> oh mah gwadddd
[3:58:36] <tr00ly_> it's not smart to make shit confusing kojima...
[3:58:37] <%TheAsianAvenger96> than where are the ghost dinos
[3:58:37] <%Valdorick> WW1? Just a voidout
[3:58:37] <$KnivesEve> wait wha
[3:58:37] <TheSandmanIsHere> @mister_mcderp five mass extinctions though
[3:58:38] <%Divryne> DINO VOIDOUTS.
[3:58:39] <goroke> This is the Sixth Impact
[3:58:40] <%misha_kastrilevich> It's stupid and I love it
[3:58:40] <%MaddyCaddy> Hiroshima and Nagasaki were void outs
[3:58:41] <%GunToad> THEM TAR PITS IN CALIFORNIA PAT
[3:58:43] <Darmarock> This is great
[3:58:44] <shogunomega> No Pat you don't understand
[3:58:45] <%Animorphimagi> it's actually REALLY GOOD
[3:58:45] <+trustycoyote> I like revisionist history though....
[3:58:46] <%Meow0369> It's not saying that at all pat you weren't listening
[3:58:46] <ape_hawk> SO ITS A KOJIMA STORY, EH?!
[3:58:47] <EsotericOdyssey> but wait
[3:58:48] <HeroToxiko> THE GOO IS DINOSAURS LUL
[3:58:48] <Dr_Mooose> imagine a dinosaur BT
[3:58:49] <wannabemoogle> its so dumb I love it
[3:58:50] <Oncamimus> maybe it should be called The Great Death Stranding?
[3:58:50] <corpsegoo> without spoilers, heartman has been researching this shit a long time and has more context for the cave paintings
[3:58:51] <Sol_Install> TAR PITS ARE BTS
[3:58:52] <%TheMilhouseExperience> If they were so great, why were they all dead?
[3:58:55] <FutaSnek> Pat's ability to retain story while bullshit happens around him is amazing LUL
[3:58:55] <shotgang86> oooh yeah the Dumb pseudo science Kojima shit. that's what I'm here for
[3:58:56] <Demon_chann> @AngriestPat What did you expect from kojima?
[3:58:59] <EsotericOdyssey> i thought the voidouts and the death stranding only happened with sapient life
[3:59:00] <%Doomcoder> but I guess this is implying that the reason only humans have BTs isn't that they are the only entities with souls, it's that it's our turn on the species chopping block?
[3:59:00] <%BurningLlama777> Anybody else noticing the black evil juice filling BB's tank
[3:59:02] <+cereal_box_conspiracy> science shmience, you can just make up whatever you want and so long YOU don't know why we think it was an asteroid it's fine
[3:59:02] <Demon_chann> LUL
[3:59:03] <EsotericOdyssey> were dinosaurs sapient
[3:59:04] <DesuDesuDokiDoki> dino ghost cummies
[3:59:05] <ape_hawk> REMEMBER, PAT: A BUNCH OF AI'S WERE RESPONSIBLE FOR EVERY WAR!
[3:59:05] <FackinCrazy> Lmao dino bt's getting all grabby
[3:59:08] <Ipsenscastle> lol thanks music
[3:59:09] <cheesedburgers> Secret History is my least fucking favorite trope
[3:59:10] <+walternatorz> @Dr_Mooose imagine a dinosaur reedus
[3:59:11] <%J_Papa> We'll never get tired of making fun of Kojima's content and loving it at the same time
[3:59:12] <shogunomega> Hear me out
[3:59:15] <Guardiansaiyan> @shotgang86 thats what we are ALL here for on the inside
[3:59:17] <shogunomega> Dinosaur Ghost
[3:59:18] <wannabemoogle> This means Dionosuars had souls
[3:59:18] <mayorrev> bye bye vod
[3:59:19] <%Jack_of_No_Trades> Its cause we are burning oil that we are facing another death stranding! goo bad
[3:59:20] <faldin> does that mean dinosuars had souls
[3:59:22] <Mendin> Does that mean the Snatcher big-BTs are dinosaurs?
[3:59:24] <AMaidIndeed> What if the Ice Age was a Snow timefall that rapidly accelerated the evolution of man :mindblown:
[3:59:24] <Guardiansaiyan> !uptime
[3:59:24] <agumon9000> PAT ONLY TERRORISTS USE SHOTGUNS
[3:59:25] <@Moobot> I've been playing this game for how long? Oh only 3h 59m.
[3:59:27] <%Engwithan_Elder_God> Yes
[3:59:28] <Guardiansaiyan> YES
[3:59:29] <Oncamimus> Also...why the hell dont we see Dino BTs then? Did they all get peed on?
[3:59:30] <%Harthhammer> yes
[3:59:30] <%oktavia_von> dino higgs
[3:59:30] <%Laecerelius> YES
[3:59:30] <ALTRNico> yes
[3:59:31] <DesuDesuDokiDoki> ye
[3:59:31] <hat_under_bread> Yes.
[3:59:32] <Guardiansaiyan> Yes Pat
[3:59:32] <TheSandmanIsHere> maybe the next thing is the Deaf Stranding and everyone loses their sense of hearing?
[3:59:33] <Mendin> Woolie does
[3:59:33] <AMaidIndeed> YES
[3:59:35] <Guardiansaiyan> YES
[3:59:36] <%Piemen99> who knows
[3:59:36] <OldManDeckardCain> NOT ENOUGH
[3:59:36] <Guardiansaiyan> Y E S
[3:59:37] <FackinCrazy> that means you can hang oout with dinosaurs in heaven
[3:59:39] <+NitronStreams> sey
[3:59:39] <%joylent_blue> i'm sticking with the "dinosaurs have souls" narrative
[3:59:41] <+trustycoyote> What do the mind goblins think?!
[3:59:43] <%Zamorouskiwhich> No. You need at least 40
[3:59:44] <%DedlokPM> @AngriestPat The La Brea Tar Pits are just Dinosaur BTs, Pat
[3:59:44] <shotgang86> who doesn't?
[3:59:46] <EsotericOdyssey> was there a dino jesus
[3:59:47] <%Engwithan_Elder_God> How else will you get the jar on the top shelf?
[3:59:47] <%thenumber5point5> this is all a plot of the PATRIOTS
[3:59:49] <%CrabSlacks> you do, pat. you are short
[3:59:51] <Mendin> Mormon Jesus was right after all
[3:59:52] <TheSandmanIsHere> or it's the Depth Stranding and the world becomes 2D
[3:59:52] <%BurningLlama777> Of course dinosaurs have souls
[3:59:53] <%Jack_of_No_Trades> Do you need to eat food everyday? No. Should you? Yes
[3:59:55] <Oncamimus> @joylent_blue Yes

[4:02:01] <Guardiansaiyan> CONFIRMED
[4:02:01] <%BurningLlama777> Maybe there WAS a voidout

[4:02:03] <%Divryne> VOIDOUT KILLED THE ROMAN EMPIRE.
[4:02:03] <%Valdorick> There was Pat - the void out was the FLOOD
[4:02:04] <shogunomega> this Jesus lore is deep
[4:02:04] <+D00msDayDan> well the voidout is only if BTs get you
[4:02:05] <Oncamimus> Maybe
[4:02:06] <%skizzuto> the real question is was trilobyte jesus also a stand user?
[4:02:06] <wannabemoogle> redus is jesus
[4:02:09] <OldManDeckardCain> I swear, if the dinos appear in this game and have FAKIN FEATHERS Imma rage

[4:02:12] <%poohtrailsnailcooch> Thats why they put him the tomb
[4:02:12] <ape_hawk> THE CRUSADERS ALL HAD DOOMS

[4:02:16] <%Doomcoder> "Behold, this is my blood, now throw it at ghosts"
[4:02:16] <%linkster291> Because he wasn't killed by BTs.
[4:02:16] <%SGrim> @AngriestPat why do you think all those rocks shook and cried out? That was the void out.
[4:02:16] <%Typhaeon> I knew it
[4:02:18] <FutaSnek> I CANT LUL
[4:02:18] <+silvery_cricket> They put his corpse in a sealed cave to contain the void out
[4:02:18] <+D00msDayDan> if the terrorists kill you or you fall to your death you just come back
[4:02:18] <lethallylactic> LUL
[4:02:18] <GMN1> that explain so much

[4:02:19] <Oncamimus> duh raptor jesus is real
[4:02:20] <%oktavia_von> the great flood was a death stranding
[4:02:20] <%XeroSigmaPrime> Voidouts only happen if a living human is eaten by BT
[4:02:20] <Sokumotanaka> XD
[4:02:20] <ALTRNico> JOJO PART 7 THO
[4:02:21] <Dr_Mooose> HOLY SHIT Pat

[4:02:21] <%joylent_blue> we fucking cracked it
[4:02:23] <+RayDaug> Jesus whipping jugs of his own urine at the Romans
[4:02:23] <%misha_kastrilevich> SCARY MONSTERS
[4:02:26] <KeystoneA1> Was Rasputin a repatriate?
[4:02:27] <+trustycoyote> We've fallen down a hole haven't we, chat
[4:02:27] <deviate_dv8> He didn't die, he went to a beach! ITS THE ONLY EXPLANATION!
[4:02:28] <%Divryne> The first Death Stranding was a coverup by the Catholic Church. @AngriestPat
[4:02:28] <TheSandmanIsHere> RAPTOR JESUS LIVES AGAIN
[4:02:29] <Mendin> Trilobite Jesus, like all other Jesii, had Ticket To Ride as a stand
[4:02:29] <%Strider222> THE PLOT THICKENS
[4:02:29] <aeonicvector> Did Dinosaurs figure out how to deliver pizza flat?
[4:02:32] <superd4v3> @AngriestPat Jeebus was a stand user and a repatriate
[4:02:32] <Nested_Dreams> What if voidout happened in Gomorrah?
[4:02:32] <AMaidIndeed> WE"RE CONNECTING THE STRANDS!
[4:02:34] <Flarepulse> God invented BT to stop the Tower of Babel from being completed
[4:02:34] <shogunomega> Part 7 Jojo is now explained
[4:02:34] <lethallylactic> SourPls
[4:02:36] <%CrabSlacks> we know jesus rode dinosaurs, but WAS he a dinosaur?
[4:02:36] <%the_mental_punk> was the holocaust like a controlled death stranding
[4:02:37] <maxpasta> What is this Steel Ball Run shit
[4:02:39] <%TheMilhouseExperience> Sodom and gameraa was a voidout
[4:02:41] <%joylent_blue> the thick plottens
[4:02:42] <corpsegoo> voidouts are an incredibly recent event related to recent fuckery vs past instances of extinction events
[4:02:43] <EsotericOdyssey> @AngriestPat if the voidouts can only happen to creatures with souls/sapience, and there were 5 extinctions/death strandings, that has to mean dinosaurs and trilobites and shit had souls
[4:02:44] <cheesedburgers> BT didn’t necrotize you only have 48 hours before you turn into a BT and Jesus was dead for 72
[4:02:46] <+ClaudeMcGarren> @AngriestPat holy shit pat was noah the first porter?!
[4:02:49] <Guardiansaiyan> @CrabSlacks he is everything and NOTHING
[4:02:49] <Oncamimus> no...because raspuitin did die at some point...he could just take a beating
[4:02:52] <Nested_Dreams> And people actually turned to chiralium salt
[4:02:53] <TheSandmanIsHere> oh my God this game is just Steel Ball Run in reverse
[4:02:54] <+NitronStreams> Ah I see ghosts hate music
[4:02:57] <zettig> Jesus didn't die, he just went to beach for three days!
[4:02:59] <FackinCrazy> Remember that old sitcom the dinosaurs? the end of that show was just the death stranding
[4:03:01] <HoIlywood_SN> @AngriestPat Death Stranding: The Dinosaurs went extinct because of the ghost tranding oil voidout in order to give rise to T-Rex Ghost Jesus so a trucker could chug energy drinks and shill AMC tv shows
[4:03:01] <Mister_McDerp> the dinosaurs were just trying to make Pangaea whole again
[4:03:03] <Mendin> @ClaudeMcGarren Moses and the commandments
[4:03:04] <BearSawed> day of darkness after jesus died was the void out

[4:03:10] <+NitronStreams> GOLD
[4:03:12] <TheSandmanIsHere> we're running east to west, putting Jesus back together as we go
[4:03:13] <SetsuRyuu> kojima is a genius he figured it all out
[4:03:17] <Guardiansaiyan> @FackinCrazy that was a sad endning
[4:03:23] <%Laecerelius> It's just gold painted
[4:03:29] <Oncamimus> Make Pangaea whole again
[4:03:35] <Mendin> God sent a Voidout to destroy Sodom & Gomorrah, Lot's wife turned into a pillar of chirilium
[4:03:36] <shogunomega> Kojima has been in the Vatican finding out about Dinosaur Jesus
[4:03:36] <ChrisM341> Roar, starring Tyrannosaurus Rex on AMC
[4:03:38] <%joylent_blue> this chat somehow manages to tie everything back to jojo i love you guys
[4:03:38] <%TheMilhouseExperience> You actually learn to spot BTs with your eyes if you get used to playing without BB.
[4:03:39] <waifoong98> this fake goldcoat paint arghhh
[4:03:45] <+trustycoyote> @Oncamimus LUL
[4:03:57] <TheSandmanIsHere> @joylent_blue that's because everything does tie back to Jojo
[4:04:00] <%Alpha8087> Aw that hurt
[4:04:01] <shotgang86> The Passion of TyronoChrist
[4:04:02] <+ClaudeMcGarren> @Mendin shit your right, and noah was running from a void out! PogChamp
[4:04:04] <Mendin> Woolie will never get this far into the game so he will never learn the true biblical history
[4:04:04] <+trustycoyote> @Oncamimus That got me WAY harder than I expected
[4:04:04] <%joylent_blue> LUL
[4:04:08] <%BallerSwagBro9k> Wonder if Pat knows BB is Fate reference? LUL
[4:04:08] <%XeroSigmaPrime> Voidouts happen because of collision of anti matter and matter, which only hapeen when a living human is eaten by a BT... so humans souls have matter.... SO ALL OF US MATTER <3
[4:04:10] <zenith0111> Kojima is a genius. How else can you even get the talent or money to make a game like this that goes against almost every convention of videogames but still sticks the landing?
[4:04:14] <FackinCrazy> @Guardiansaiyan well they should have let dinosaur jesus into their hearts
[4:04:14] <%oktavia_von> this is turning more and more into a jojo plot
[4:04:15] <%Alpha8087> Look at this Lorule road
[4:04:23] <TheSandmanIsHere> wait does this mean that Araki is a repatriate and that's why he doesn't age?
[4:04:29] <Guardiansaiyan> @FackinCrazy with a hint of faithful vore on the side?
[4:04:32] <%Laecerelius> BECOME AS ROADS!
[4:04:33] <Mendin> Araki just has DOOMS
[4:04:37] <+RowenCleric> the chat doesnt bring things back to jojo, its just that everything in this world naturally returns to jojo
[4:04:40] <valriot> But you fell OFF the road LUL
[4:04:42] <+Yagerme> I just got my bb back
[4:04:43] <%Typhaeon> God of Roads himself
[4:04:47] <%FrostMass22> Can Norman die from old age?
[4:04:48] <HoIlywood_SN> @AngriestPat i like your ostentatious Sexual Disease Transmission truck
[4:04:50] <MesozoicMystery> This is the second time Kojima killed off the Dinos in a weird way. The last time was when language parasites killed them all.
[4:04:51] <kumballzz> what happens when you kill someone. Anyone got a video
[4:04:51] <%XeroSigmaPrime> Are BT's just the stands of dead people?
[4:04:53] <shogunomega> Kojima needs to be careful, the Vatican doesn't like there secrets exposed
[4:04:57] <%BallerSwagBro9k> @rowencleric EXACTLY LUL
[4:05:00] <Mister_McDerp> big blind
[4:05:04] <%TheMilhouseExperience> But do you have the ceramics?
[4:05:13] <zenith0111> @xerosigmaprime Basically LUL
[4:05:15] <Oncamimus> So sixth sense was really just about a boy who had dooms?
[4:05:19] <%BurningLlama777> It must be comforting to live your life in the Death Stranding universe knowing that the dead will do anything to claw their way back into the world, screaming and shrieking.
[4:05:21] <corpsegoo> theoreticall, no, Sam can't die of old age despite growing older
[4:05:23] <Mendin> Oh my god in the book Angels & Demons, the Illuminati are trying to cause a voidout in the Vatican
[4:05:24] <%misha_kastrilevich> OH NO! NOT THE RAIN
[4:05:24] <TheSandmanIsHere> @rowencleric everything is drawn back together by [GRAVITY]
[4:05:25] <Mendin> IT ALL MAKES SENSE NOW
[4:05:26] <%Alpha8087> That is a windy-ass road lol
[4:05:30] <%J_Papa> What I like about Kojima is that yeah he's trying to be an artist but he's not above putting some stupid video-gamey silly crap in that reminds us we're playing to be entertained
[4:05:30] <%thenumber5point5> Jojo x Eva x "The Postman" crossover game
[4:05:34] <wannabemoogle> oh shit if jesus was a repatriate does that make Judas Higgs?
[4:05:45] <Psyramics> every time Pat says 'ceramics' I get that same sense as when someone called my name in school, but meant someone else
[4:05:45] <Mendin> Souls have matter, Chiralium defies [Gravity]
[4:05:46] <%misha_kastrilevich> What is a void out?
[4:05:53] <zenith0111> @burningllama777 That's the hardest sale I've seen in a while LUL
[4:05:54] <Habblewater> Where's Mads at?
[4:05:54] <%TheMilhouseExperience> Ceramics are THE BIGGEST PAIN to get in the game.
[4:05:56] <Guardiansaiyan> @wannabemoogle Judas = Pre-beta Higgs
[4:06:02] <shogunomega> Hugh Jackedman and Sam are the only one who can stop the Vatican
[4:06:03] <%Explodincatz> IGN LUL
[4:06:04] <%Alpha8087> Man I give the game credit for auto-allocating the path, imagine you having to draw it out
[4:06:09] <%Doomcoder> Huge-Jackedman
[4:06:10] <%GeneralSCPatton> THE TUTORIAL ENDS HERE
[4:06:11] <Mendin> Mads is in a timestorm where he belongs
[4:06:12] <ape_hawk> YOURE STILL IN THE TUTORIAL
[4:06:12] <Mister_McDerp> so if humanity survives the stranding then we are officially better than the dinosaurs
[4:06:13] <%BurningLlama777> When Judas kissed Jesus he planted a thermonuclear device on his cheek.
[4:06:13] <ChrisM341> Too much Water
[4:06:15] <waifoong98> so who's Jesus BB LUL
[4:06:17] <maxpasta> @misha_kastrilevich it’s a big explosion that happens when a corpse begins to decompose
[4:06:19] <zenith0111> @j_papa 👍
[4:06:20] <%joylent_blue> misha_kastrilevich basically a nuclear explosion but with ghost magic
[4:06:20] <%GarbageNirvana> IGN doesn't like challenges
[4:06:21] <%oktavia_von> tomatoSN this is too much chat
[4:06:21] <%TheMilhouseExperience> Wait for it.
[4:06:23] <Plugman86> The terrorist camp east of Mountain Knot distro is the best place to farm ceramics
[4:06:23] <FackinCrazy> At the end of the game sam has to fist fight jesus for the right to date his sister
[4:06:26] <Demon_chann> guys why is mads so handsome
[4:06:28] <Ipsenscastle> pretty
[4:06:30] <Mendin> When Judas killed Jesus, he triggered his aphephosmophobia
[4:06:34] <valriot> Yeah it's called being bad at a videogame and projecting it as a problem with the game, just like character action review
[4:06:36] <Mendin> *kissed
[4:06:39] <TheSandmanIsHere> it's the end of part one. now we start the farming arc.
[4:06:45] <%GeneralSCPatton> YOU'RE ACTUALLY STILL IN THE OPENING CUTSCENE
[4:06:48] <wannabemoogle> History just keeps repeating itself till a void-out kills a species
[4:06:48] <tigerfang86> @FackinCrazy don't spoil the end of jojo part 9 my guy
[4:06:49] <+Yagerme> I spent 2 day just building Every road.
[4:06:54] <%TheMilhouseExperience> They probably wasted all their bandwidth before the mountains.
[4:06:55] <shogunomega> BITES THE DUST
[4:06:55] <%XeroSigmaPrime> What? That place usually has special alloys, not ceramics
[4:06:56] <%misha_kastrilevich> So does that mean that the holocaust could be a voidout?
[4:06:57] <%DedlokPM> @misha_kastrilevich huge explosion caused when a bt touches a human
[4:06:58] <shogunomega> you just started
[4:07:07] <SethAm_> A voidout is a miniature nuke of sorts that triggers when a BT eats a living person. The BT's anitmatter meets the person's matter causing a reaction.
[4:07:08] <%miguelrod777> this is still the prologue soon the real mc will appear
[4:07:10] <Crimpson> You killed her
[4:07:10] <Mendin> Hey Pat ask Paige if she knows about Mingus
[4:07:11] <Dr_Mooose> again?
[4:07:11] <%Mottyrob> again?
[4:07:16] <NeroInfinite> I too was dieing earlier
[4:07:16] <Demon_chann> when is she not dying?
[4:07:18] <%BallerSwagBro9k> As always
[4:07:19] <%Typhaeon> Paige is a repatriate
[4:07:20] <Mastigias> when is she not?
[4:07:21] <%DedlokPM> This is still the title screen
[4:07:21] <%FrostMass22> Imagine listening to music
[4:07:24] <Guardiansaiyan> yikes
[4:07:25] <D3rrtyD4n> atpCap
[4:07:26] <SethAm_> a corpse alone doesn't actually cause a voidout on its own
[4:07:26] <Mister_McDerp> A GHOST NUKE
[4:07:27] <TheSandmanIsHere> pat kills relationships, including his own
[4:07:27] <ShichiNoBushi> Paige is necrotizing as we speak.
[4:07:28] <Guardiansaiyan> wow
[4:07:28] <Ipsenscastle> OH MAN WHAT IF THERES A DINOSAUR BT AT THE END sorry for caps but GODDAMN
[4:07:29] <%ThatOneGameTester> She's a repatriate right?
[4:07:30] <+MisoPhat_> what's a sam
[4:07:30] <+yoshkosh20> paige is in a constant state of half-life. the poor dear
[4:07:30] <a_mad_dragon> voidout = BIG BOOM

[4:16:38] <%FrostMass22> No, Marie had a pretty alright life. Skylar had it rough.
[4:16:39] <%XeroSigmaPrime> Marie sucked sometimes, but actually grew competant later
[4:16:40] <Plugman86> marie literally has zero excuse to be that big a bitch

[4:16:59] <%BallerSwagBro9k> Of course you do LUL
[4:16:59] <%Keyd00d> All the characters had problems
[4:17:04] <TheSandmanIsHere> the only person in Breaking Bad who deserved to live was Jesse
[4:17:04] <wannabemoogle> I want to hear his screams in hd
[4:17:04] <ALTRNico> LOUD
[4:17:06] <shogunomega> But Peach, you hate all the WO-MEN
[4:17:07] <%neodeltai> Both actresses did a great job, but their characters were insufferable.
[4:17:07] <%realm_forge> Just tuned in to Pats ass dent in the couch

[4:17:31] <OldManDeckardCain> Walt did nothing wrong Kappa
[4:17:31] <HoIlywood_SN> he's an asshole but he's not "evil"
[4:17:37] <Plugman86> Walt enjoys being a criminal, don't forget the ending
[4:17:37] <thetruthofyourbeing> cant hear shit
[4:17:37] <%J_Papa> Skylar was all like omg i can't live with this criminal, then she was like well i guess i'll be a criminal too and enable this criminal by doing his crime for him
[4:17:39] <%joylent_blue> SAY AGAIN?
[4:17:41] <Nina96> the game is actually super loud pat @AngriestPat
[4:17:41] <%Meow0369> Walt is explicitly NOT evil, he's driven to doing evil things but his entire character is that he's not evil, he's just making terrible choices
[4:17:42] <Oncamimus> Hmmm...the next question would be....do conjoined twins become one when one of their bodies die then? Or was it some fluke that Mama and Lockne had that?
[4:17:42] <%miguelrod777> we cant hear ypu guys
[4:17:42] <%Alpha8087> Paige what up

[4:17:48] <%nofestu2> Paige MIC
[4:17:51] <+trustycoyote> One of my favorite aspects of that show was how there were no perfect characters on that show. They all did something shitty at one point in time.
[4:17:52] <ALTRNico> WHAT WAS PAIGE SAYING?
[4:17:52] <shogunomega> Game audio may be to high

[4:18:21] <Verriand> Walt goes evil, but we're there for the ride and it allows us to ignore the final product better
[4:18:22] <%Laecerelius> Shove it up there, Paige
[4:18:22] <zenith0111> Walter White is suppose to show how good intentions are what can turn you into a horrible man.
[4:18:23] <Flarepulse> Paige censored by Blizzard

[4:26:52] <damascussteele> Ijust drank six cups of coffee because it tastes like cotton candy whyyyyyyyyyy
[4:26:54] <%Alpha8087> Its suspended in Monster Energy Drink
[4:26:57] <%Typhaeon> Yeah you go deliver that homeopathic medicine that does nothing
[4:26:58] <%BurningLlama777> We wouldn't be getting supercells if people were doing drink offerings and burnt offerings like they're supposed to.
[4:26:59] <$Mothman742> ha ha everyone in pats chat has smol penor
[4:26:59] <%thenumber5point5> scan might be a shelter
[4:27:01] <ChrisM341> She's tornado about to touch down. Its fine

[4:27:46] <%FrostMass22> @commanderclaw Shut up, that's how
[4:27:47] <Mendin> Though I'm guessing Fragile's beach is messed up if there's timestorm fuckery again so you cant fast travel
[4:27:47] <%Varlinator> How's Pat dealing with the death mountains?
[4:27:50] <%Strider222> UNLEASH
[4:27:51] <%trustycoyote> Yeah, isn't snow the WORST form of time fall?
[4:27:56] <%BallerSwagBro9k> @commanderclaw Its fiiiiiiiiine
[4:27:57] <tigerfang86> UNLEASH THE MONSTER
[4:27:59] <%BurningLlama777> I heard that if you drink Monster Energy regularly you actually age in reverse. It's slow but it's in reverse.
[4:27:59] <%Doomcoder> it does seem like time snow works different
[4:28:02] <+timmc916> i love those funky floating tardigrades
[4:28:02] <thetruthofyourbeing> Give sam a heart attack
[4:28:02] <Run44forrest> @damascussteele youll be fine. why cotton candy tho that sounds gross
[4:28:05] <%king_wragles> @trustycoyote I dunno, maybe hail is worse?
[4:28:08] <Ipsenscastle> let the Reedus peedus
[4:28:08] <ne_zha> How does every cabin have Monster Energy? Do they Chiral Print it?
[4:28:10] <brambobelurkin> So I am about half way through Steel Ball Run and all I can say is Woolie was right. This is the best part so far.

[4:29:59] <%Engwithan_Elder_God> That looks friendly.
[4:29:59] <%BurningLlama777> Norman Reedus is 50 years old, meaning his lifespan is about 10% over.

[4:30:27] <valriot> Norman looking that good at 50 means he probably does chug Monster irl
[4:30:27] <%J_Papa> NAHHH its fine, meet me under it!
[4:30:29] <%BurningLlama777> Norman owes his incredible longevity to the crisp, refreshing taste of Monster Energy.
[4:30:30] <+SkaiVibration> ACTION ROLL

[4:30:49] <%Jack_of_No_Trades> Id consult a meteorologist before jumping to conclusions
[4:30:51] <%Sxy_T_Rex> is that the bifrost?
[4:30:51] <%Keyd00d> Welcome to the midwest
[4:30:51] <%TheMilhouseExperience> Norman Reedus and Keanu Reeves have Michael J Fox disease that makes you always look young.
[4:30:51] <+TheSaintJohn> you don't know if its a death cyclone, it could be some kinda life cyclone

[4:41:47] <tiaramaki> WAR NEVER CHANGES
[4:41:49] <%Deft_Thought> So this is Valhalla?
[4:41:49] <TheoTTree> DRAFTED INTO THE SKELETON WAR
[4:41:49] <LunarRemix> You mean they are just playing a very good FPS?
[4:41:54] <%SGrim> @AngriestPat so it's Juno?
[4:41:57] <ALTRNico> LOVES IT
[4:41:57] <%Typhaeon> He's a real son of the Beach
[4:41:58] <Guardiansaiyan> @BurningLlama777 watch the developers of Call of Duty ignore it
[4:41:59] <akaSiggy> 70% of Deadman's body is harvested organs?
[4:42:00] <Run44forrest> HE PLAYED COD 4
[4:42:01] <Psyramics> Unlimited Gun Works
[4:42:01] <zenith0111> LOVES IT
[4:42:01] <NotHereToStream> I love war speech etc etc
[4:42:02] <%Alpha8087> BECAUSE WAR NEVER CGANGES
[4:42:02] <tigerfang86> ALL WAR
[4:42:02] <Sokumotanaka> This is every old white guy's beach!
[4:42:03] <waifoong98> so where is Big Boss and the Boss Kappa
[4:42:03] <%ChaosAethr> this is ww2
[4:42:04] <mistertrashman> war is badass
[4:42:05] <wannabemoogle> War Histry Buff
[4:42:05] <mayorrev> EAT BUG
[4:42:06] <%GeneralSCPatton> OR HE CAN NEVER ESCAPE WAR
[4:42:08] <TheSandmanIsHere> this is what infinity ward developers see in their nightmares
[4:42:08] <cheesedburgers> These Call of Duty players still going to this day
[4:42:09] <Scrub_Seeker> this looks like the bombing of london specifically
[4:42:12] <zenith0111> @psyramics PogChamp omg it is
[4:42:13] <%BurningLlama777> @Guardiansaiyan Not enough loot boxes?
[4:42:13] <tigerfang86> GRAB THOSE BUGS
[4:42:14] <wannabemoogle> LOL
[4:42:14] <@commanderclaw> Maybe Mads is a Chinese Myth Dragon, and was in Wars
[4:42:14] <shogunomega> War never changes
[4:42:15] <%J_Papa> War is Hell and Hell is metal
[4:42:16] <%dekkitout> Is Mads just Sato from Ajin- cause fuck, Sato's simultaneously the best and worst!
[4:42:18] <%ThatOneGameTester> i mean, lots of people love war movies
[4:42:19] <%trustycoyote> mini whales?
[4:42:19] <T_Sasquatch> This engine
[4:42:20] <%linSP> this is the cod 12 year olds perfect afterlife
[4:42:22] <Asuxley> or he's trapped in wars
[4:42:22] <T_Sasquatch> Mhhhmm
[4:42:23] <xbb1024> He probably does recreations
[4:42:25] <Ipsenscastle> Operation: Dolphin Drop
[4:42:25] <%BallerSwagBro9k> I think hes just traumatized by war
[4:42:25] <a_mad_dragon> THE DOLPHINS
[4:42:26] <+Yagerme> @
[4:42:26] <Guardiansaiyan> @BurningLlama777 or 'Suprise Mechanics
[4:42:27] <%marvel877> THIS IS SOME SORROW BOSS FIGHT ZONE.
[4:42:27] <Mendin> Mads is goign to say a heated gamer word
[4:42:30] <Demon_chann> maybe mads is just a war nerd
[4:42:32] <fist_wizard_jay> Pat at this rate HOW DO WE KNOW HE DIDNT FIGHT IN THESE WARS
[4:42:32] <ne_zha> Pat is actually right about something? wtf
[4:42:32] <corpsegoo> I feel like big boss would be fairly chill staying on one of these beaches forever instead of going to an afterlife
[4:42:33] <%BurningLlama777> This is accurate; people worship World War 2 and talk about every aspect of it endlessly.
[4:42:33] <%Deft_Thought> What if Madds was just a nerd and L33T gamer
[4:42:35] <%CarcerDun> it's probably meant to be somewehre in france
[4:42:35] <tigerfang86> WHALE
[4:42:37] <%ThatOneGameTester> nmah just bombs fro mthe sky Pat
[4:42:39] <%Deft_Thought> And he loved CoD
[4:42:39] <HeadsHeldHigh> get a close up of the infested tanks
[4:42:39] <Guardiansaiyan> @marvel877 not enough parrots or guilt trips
[4:42:41] <uncledoodsauce> I'm guessing mad's top 5 movies are apocylapse now, saving private ryan, and 1914.
[4:42:44] <%GarbageNirvana> tactical roll
[4:42:44] <%thenumber5point5> the brotherhood of soldiers connect all honorable soldiers in death
[4:42:44] <%Sxy_T_Rex> Can't wait for Mads to just wail on Normans nugs
[4:42:45] <+Yagerme> He watched a lot of the history channel
[4:42:45] <cheesedburgers> I wish there were more of these sections they’re so visually incredible
[4:42:46] <%chiluzza> Either france or the netherlands
[4:42:53] <Run44forrest> reminds me of that scene from mgs4
[4:42:54] <%BurningLlama777> They lick their lips and drool, and fantasize about us being in another war like it.
[4:42:54] <Mister_McDerp> looks like netherlands
[4:42:54] <KeystoneA1> This kind of looks like the Netherlands
[4:42:55] <%cureneckbeard> is this that part in mgs4
[4:42:58] <Guardiansaiyan> @Yagerme false...not enough nazis
[4:42:59] <%Niney_Who> Poland?
[4:42:59] <TheSandmanIsHere> mads fucking loved A Bridge Too Far
[4:43:00] <valriot> This is NOT London, it's mostly likely France or Netherlands
[4:43:00] <%marvel877> SEWER PAT!
[4:43:02] <Mendin> I bet his name isnt even Clifford Under and it's liteally just Combat Veteranman
[4:43:02] <Lutre> Britain hasn't been full-force invaded in like a millenium or some shit
[4:43:08] <+dualviper25> it kinda feels like italy
[4:43:11] <%BallerSwagBro9k> Vive La France
[4:43:12] <Nina96> Netherlands is my guess
[4:43:13] <T_Sasquatch> This entire thing just built for a dumb sequence
[4:43:13] <shogunomega> Mad is the type to do road runs in his back yard waiting to be a solider as a kid
[4:43:16] <+RyloStar> this is NOT London, it's either iraq and vietnam
[4:43:16] <waifoong98> ewww gooey
[4:43:19] <ShichiNoBushi> Later it's said to be Eastern Europe.
[4:43:26] <%anticrust> A SEWER LEVELLLL

[5:00:31] <%BallerSwagBro9k> Clifford Dog
[5:00:32] <%Sxy_T_Rex> Cliff Clavin?
[5:00:37] <+QueequegTheater> @TheSandmanIsHere That's standard
[5:00:37] <%Meow0369> it's so obviously meant to be a reveal obscured by shaky camera movement
[5:00:39] <+machshop> yep

[5:00:54] <+ClaudeMcGarren> @TheSandmanIsHere i take it you've never seen dogtags before......
[5:00:55] <TheSandmanIsHere> TIL
[5:00:57] <%bevyrage> you take one tag from a body to report them dead and the other tag stays with the corpse for identification
[5:01:00] <Mendin> From the report on the voidout in the mountain
[5:01:01] <%supersugoisenpai1> I find these incredibly difficult to S rank
[5:01:01] <%cureneckbeard> one for your first name, one for your last name
[5:01:03] <+LtSergei> when i was a kid i thought dog tags were in case a soldier bumped their head and forgot their name
[5:01:03] <%Jack_of_No_Trades> Sads Mikelson
[5:01:05] <Habblewater> UnSane
[5:01:08] <%Maids4lyfe> they took one because he was already dead

[5:01:09] <VritraReiRei> @thenumber5point5 well i mean the protag is hellbent on not giving him away. is there a reason for that or did Sam just get attached to it
[5:01:12] <%XeroSigmaPrime> One for you, one for your penis

[5:08:30] <%wookie5358> the fabled beaches multiverse
[5:08:31] <%CrabSlacks> but what about the shadow
[5:08:33] <+QueequegTheater> THRONE WORLDS

[5:08:42] <BigBrandon907> Heartmans voice is nice
[5:08:43] <+crowmium> uh huh...
[5:08:43] <Dr_Mooose> I guess that actually makes sense
[5:08:44] <+QueequegTheater> @AngriestPat BEACHES ARE LITERALLY DESTINY THRONE WORLDS
[5:08:46] <%Sxy_T_Rex> So it's just The Warp
[5:08:47] <%BurningLlama777> "Hell is other people"
[5:08:47] <%trustycoyote> Feet on stream! : P
[5:08:49] <TheSandmanIsHere> what we need is the Book of Going Forth By Day
[5:08:49] <mankeytennis> He's sitting down for the exposition dump.
[5:08:50] <$jaxondorf> Egyptian Mythology?!
[5:08:51] <MrDonTacos_> Kojima Gaming Universe
[5:08:51] <Manly_Rose> Feet o_o
[5:08:52] <%tweedler92> I love that Sam hates it to LUL
[5:08:54] <%oktavia_von> no soap
[5:08:56] <%Tucker0603> IT IS THE WARP!!!
[5:08:57] <%Divryne> NORMAN DOESN'T CARE.
[5:08:57] <Khorneflakes_> Sam is like, "I just want to take a shower"
[5:08:57] <%Laecerelius> Yeah, it's the Warp
[5:08:57] <Habblewater> Fuck off Hartman i'm trying to wash my bollocks
[5:08:58] <mayorrev> limbo?
[5:08:59] <faldin> sounds like hell

[5:09:02] <Mendin> So it's ValHELLa
[5:09:03] <+DRAGKUDO> where's the fucking soap
[5:09:04] <%BallerSwagBro9k> Time Loop
[5:09:04] <zenith0111> @mayorrev Basically
[5:09:05] <%Typhaeon> Valhalla with nothing but fighting
[5:09:06] <+Drfunkenstein7> no soap?
[5:09:07] <Ipsenscastle> Inside Sam's head: 'yummy yummy yummy I've got love in my tummy...'
[5:09:07] <tiaramaki> No soap, no cloth or scrubbie...
[5:09:08] <+justianxix> Endless looping battles
[5:09:11] <T_Sasquatch> Just dump everything , don't even try to show just tell
[5:09:12] <+crowmium> record player? zoomers don't know what that is Kojima
[5:09:12] <lethallylactic> So are there people experiencing concentration camps for eternity or something? monkaS
[5:09:13] <+machshop> he can ride the hatewaves
[5:09:13] <WillyFresh992> I want the afterlife to be New Game +
[5:09:16] <%Doomcoder> @QueequegTheater Sam, Die-Hardman here. For this next mission, you're going to need to make your sword logic stronger than Higgs's sword logic."
[5:09:17] <+HuntingHornPete> their vision of hell.
[5:09:18] <mayorrev> time to meet him
[5:09:20] <HyperBomb21> Heartman is next PogChamp
[5:09:21] <fist_wizard_jay> Sounding like Super Limbo

[5:09:33] <mayorrev> THATS A COOL RINGTONE
[5:09:33] <maxpasta> Ok diavolo
[5:09:36] <+timmc916> where did his clothes come from?
[5:09:37] <%anticrust> I can explain it: WWII is cool so they wanted to tput it in
[5:09:37] <%marvel877> Check on BB
[5:09:41] <+QueequegTheater> @Doomcoder Whether we wanted to or not...
[5:09:43] <CrypticMochi> Melding pot of everyone’s mind goblins
[5:09:45] <+Yagerme> Shitty beaches like Florida
[5:09:46] <Ipsenscastle> that ringtone sounds like the harry potter theme song
[5:09:46] <valriot> Okay but for real, the Heartman cutscene is the most Kojima cutscene ever
[5:09:47] <thetruthofyourbeing> he ants his vummes
[5:09:48] <%Doomcoder> I'm big confuse about Cliff's age
[5:09:50] <%Meow0369> heartman wants a body delivery so he can eat its heart to sustain his own
[5:09:52] <Darkrenai> Can i get the Cliff Notes instead Kappa
[5:09:53] <go4thekneez> what chapter is this?
[5:09:53] <fist_wizard_jay> big war nerd in general?
[5:09:57] <%misha_kastrilevich> Oh god, Cliff is one of those WW2 nerds who talk about how Hitler is misunderstood
[5:09:57] <%wookie5358> this memory is a cliffnote
[5:09:58] <Mendin> I bet we get a deadman memory inste-awwww
[5:09:59] <%DedlokPM> @timmc916 same place that they disappeared to
[5:10:00] <TheSandmanIsHere> you mean some Cliff Notes?
[5:10:01] <%BurningLlama777> So people who isolate themselves from others are absolutely correct. God only knows what happens to people who all blow up together in a voidout
[5:10:04] <+DRAGKUDO> SNAKE
[5:10:07] <%CarcerDun> yup
[5:10:09] <narusao> it's just john
[5:10:09] <+silvery_cricket> WHAT IF LOU IS A REPAITRIATE

[5:10:12] <%ArcanumMBD> No Pat, it's John. Don't be silly
[5:10:12] <cheesedburgers> These memories should be called cliffnotes
[5:10:12] <%TDAWS_MP132> that totally is diehardman, yeah
[5:10:13] <+SkaiVibration> JON?
[5:10:13] <blackesteagle> that's SNAKE
[5:10:16] <%Doomcoder> now I'm big confuse about how old Die-Hardman is????
[5:10:17] <%cureneckbeard> snek
[5:10:18] <%Meow0369> It's so obviously die hardman too
[5:10:19] <Run44forrest> JOHN DIEHARMAN monkaS

[5:10:26] <tigerfang86> YEAAAAAH
[5:10:26] <+Andrizzleton> John McClain
[5:10:26] <waifoong98> Literally Snake in Japanese
[5:10:27] <%Sxy_T_Rex> Hi Dardman
[5:10:28] <%GarbageNirvana> The only black person we've seen in the story? Nah couldn't be
[5:10:29] <%BallerSwagBro9k> ABSOLUTELY
[5:10:29] <+silvery_cricket> IF BB IS A REPIATRIATE IT WOULD EXPLAIN EVERYTHING
[5:10:30] <tigerfang86> ITS SUPER HIM
[5:10:31] <ALTRNico> BRUCE WILLIS?
[5:10:32] <NotHereToStream> no thats john liveman
[5:10:33] <Redmannasah> John Mclayne
[5:10:33] <%Divryne> JOHN DIE HARD MAN.
[5:10:33] <StarlingSilence> oh my god
[5:10:34] <%Doomcoder> it's John Stranding
[5:10:34] <+QueequegTheater> Whether we wanted it or not, we've stepped into a war with the Cabal on Mars. So let's get to taking out their command, one by one. Valus Ta'aurc. From what I can gather he commands the Siege Dancers from an Imperial Land Tank outside of Rubicon. He's well protected, but with the right team, we can punch through those defenses, take this beast out, and break their grip on Freehold.
[5:10:35] <%Jack_of_No_Trades> It could be anyone, even Deadman
[5:10:35] <sedrictheschlemp> Die Hardman is old
[5:10:36] <%Meow0369> They act like it's supposed to be someone else
[5:10:38] <%wookie5358> he's going to die so hard, man
[5:10:40] <%FrostMass22> I missed that the first time
[5:10:40] <fist_wizard_jay> IS THAT DOE HARDMAN
[5:10:41] <%thenumber5point5> while grinding this weekend Heartman is the only major story prepper in the area if you need to do some of the non-story ones to fill in gaps in your network .. hope that wasnt to spoiler
[5:10:41] <+machshop> John "Die-Hardman" Hardman
[5:10:41] <zenith0111> GIVE HIM BACK HIS BB
[5:10:43] <%BallerSwagBro9k> JOHN HALO?
[5:10:43] <%Typhaeon> It's John Freeman
[5:10:44] <Run44forrest> DIEHARMAN KILLED MY WIFE monkaS D:
[5:10:45] <%Laecerelius> I bet Die Hardman's last name is McClane
[5:10:46] <T_Sasquatch> Literally the only black character LUL
[5:10:48] <TheSandmanIsHere> road time again?
[5:10:48] <%Alpha8087> is BB Mad's biological son?

[5:10:57] <Redmannasah> @Laecerelius It literally is
[5:10:58] <%BallerSwagBro9k> Is DiehardMan JOHN HALO?
[5:10:58] <%radda343> God I hope his name is John McLane
[5:11:09] <+QueequegTheater> @dickbuttwoman actually yea
[5:11:11] <+dualviper25> @T_Sasquatch well the only black MALE cxharacter
[5:11:13] <+silvery_cricket> BB being a repaitraite would explain why is survived the first void out
[5:11:15] <fist_wizard_jay> JOHN DIEHARDMAN DOESNT AFRAID OF ZOMBIE GHOSTS
[5:11:15] <%J_Papa> A lot of people seem to be under the impression that this Death Stranding happened hundreds of years ago
[5:11:16] <Mendin> Fox only, no items
[5:11:18] <%FrostMass22> @alpha8087 seems that way
[5:11:19] <%Birdigalore> Oh God, John halo is the worst
[5:11:20] <Habblewater> FOX ONLY
[5:11:20] <+Punchasaur> YOU CAN TELL BECAUSE HES BLACK
[5:11:21] <%PanicSwytch> Isn't John Bruce willis name in die hard?
[5:11:21] <%Sxy_T_Rex> Where's John Matrix?
[5:11:22] <%TDAWS_MP132> uh huh
[5:11:22] <+QueequegTheater> @radda343 it is
[5:11:23] <%Laecerelius> FFFFFFFFFFFFUCK
[5:11:24] <lethallylactic> KKona 7
[5:11:25] <SilasDrekken> Cliff must have fucked up John's face when he died
[5:11:25] <%wookie5358> if it's john mclane, this is a christmas game
[5:11:26] <Mister_McDerp> John Die Hardman McLane
[5:11:28] <%Meow0369> His actual name is John Mclane, as in Die Hard's John McClain
[5:11:28] <Dr_Mooose> and then it will all explode
[5:11:30] <waifoong98> That's seem like a death pit
[5:11:31] <%dickbuttwoman> FUCK OFF HIS NAME IS MCLANE
[5:11:34] <cheesedburgers> Didn’t edge not get blowed up

[5:11:42] <D3rrtyD4n> what chapter is this?
[5:11:42] <%Divryne> LOOK AT THE MAP.
[5:11:43] <thetruenicster> you're not
[5:11:46] <+Maldoree> 7 more chapters!
[5:11:47] <+Andrizzleton> There was a heart lake
[5:11:49] <%Doomcoder> Chapter 6 out of 15 dogg
[5:11:49] <+LtSergei> I thought i reached the end of the game
[5:11:53] <%TDAWS_MP132> heartman is at the heart lake, for sure
[5:11:54] <sedrictheschlemp> Last Third
[5:11:54] <Zaphire_Saucypants> Make sure you do the optional prepper, directly east of the Spiritualist, offscreen. He's a bit to setup to the chiral network but necessary for the final pizza run.
[5:11:55] <+LtSergei> and it carried on for four more hours
[5:11:56] <+DRAGKUDO> Upside down America is next
[5:11:56] <SnaKemuho> those chapters aren't even in length
[5:11:57] <mayorrev> monkaS
[5:11:58] <%Meow0369> You're over halfway pat in terms of story stuff
[5:11:59] <NotHereToStream> you kind of are

[5:12:04] <SpaceGuntank> more dead body hauling?
[5:12:04] <%Keyd00d> Last chapters are short
[5:12:04] <%linkster291> Chapters are going to speed up.
[5:12:04] <mayorrev> BODY DELIVERY
[5:12:07] <+RAAAAAINMAKER> chapter 9 onwards is more watching than playing
[5:12:07] <%Animorphimagi> Youd be surprisied
[5:12:08] <Zaphire_Saucypants> so you'll wanna get on to making a zipline there
[5:12:09] <Mendin> Yeah that makes sense
[5:12:09] <%Laecerelius> HER SOUL IS IN HER SISTER, YOU IDIOT
[5:12:11] <ape_hawk> ew, gross, hes a necrophiliac
[5:12:11] <%Doomcoder> S-RANK YOUR MAMA'S CORPSE
[5:12:12] <Dr_Mooose> uh oh
[5:12:13] <$PulverKong> This is one of those plot twists like in Dragon Quest 11. When you think the game is over, you're only 1/3 of the way
[5:12:15] <+LtSergei> and then it carried on for another hour
[5:12:15] <+silvery_cricket> It be hilarious if he just dropped dead mid conversation
[5:12:17] <tigerfang86> ?
[5:12:18] <blackesteagle> When did Mama die? :P
[5:12:18] <thetruenicster> wait, mama's dead?
[5:12:21] <+dualviper25> remember mgs 5 yea KOJIMA LOVES to put false endings
[5:12:21] <%Meow0369> Shh silvery
[5:12:21] <%Laecerelius> No soul, no BT
[5:12:22] <phatmac16> This sounds like the end
[5:12:26] <%linSP> its like ff13 chapters but backwards
[5:12:27] <chrizion> i almost missed that part lol
[5:12:34] <%J_Papa> good pull @Doomcoder
[5:12:36] <+machshop> mama is inside her sister's head now
[5:12:37] <mayorrev> Sounds like Heartman's on a limited data plan
[5:12:38] <%Divryne> Look at the map where Heartman is.
[5:12:38] <Habblewater> Mama did the fusion dance with her twin
[5:12:40] <zenith0111> LUL
[5:12:41] <%psydaku> what I miss?
