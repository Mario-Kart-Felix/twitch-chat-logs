[0:01:45] <%Theycallmenerf> From my limited knowledge, Persona’s are like stands in JoJo, this is my first interaction with it. I’m guessing this is the best time to get into it, right chat?
[0:01:46] <+robobeau> Don't tell anyone guys
[0:01:46] <Draco_Renegade> How y'all doing?
[0:01:46] <clintonificent> i'm playin RE3 right now with PatSona 5 PissRoyal playing in the background its great
[0:02:00] <%SGrim> @Shonen_hero no, Pat sleeps like a burrito psaCaco

[0:03:29] <clintonificent> holy shit i'm bad at re3 I just can't dodge properly oof
[0:03:39] <mr_gunn> I haven’t played AC what’s the deal with the rabbit?
[0:03:39] <clintonificent> the zambos are unpredictable and smelly

[0:04:07] <+schlager087> also yea this rabbit has killed my ac joy
[0:04:10] <%DensityD> this twitch chat is the dark souls of twitch chat
[0:04:10] <clintonificent> altho its actually closer to DS2 tbh
[0:04:12] <%joylent_blue> mr_gunn basically there are eggs hidden everywhere and they replace certain materials, like wood, fish, etc
[0:04:16] <%Dr_Angelic> I got gifted a sub at random and holy cow psaBlep elmo is the best thank y'all
[0:04:19] <clintonificent> because its really good but kinda disappointing
[0:04:21] <clintonificent> just like DS2
[0:04:39] <+schlager087> @clintonificent what's disappointing about it?
[0:04:40] <clintonificent> its a similar level of quality to RE7 tbh
[0:04:46] <lionmanguy> !uptime
[0:04:46] <colmsball> and all the diy projects are lame af
[0:04:47] <@Moobot> I've been playing this game for how long? Oh only 4m 48s.

[0:05:32] <%joylent_blue> mr_gunn like 90% of medium size fish shadows are now eggs that sell for 200 instead of the fish that would sell for 3k or more
[0:05:35] <%Ganerumo> I had to shell out 50 bucks because I made a bet Max would die more than Pat in his RE3 run. He died 4 times less.
[0:05:35] <saiyan24675> hi
[0:05:36] <%joylent_blue> stuff like that
[0:05:39] <+JohnyG> Makoto best girl
[0:05:40] <clintonificent> @schlager087 just cut some stuff from the original which made the game relatively short, and some of the areas in the later half fall flat, its an 8.5 when it coulda been a 10
[0:05:41] <+JohnyG> Let’s go
[0:05:43] <%j0ustar> The orb. It graces us
[0:05:46] <mr_gunn> @joylent_blue You hate to see it
[0:05:49] <fenrirmitsuki> Anyone else miss the Blooming Villain intro?
[0:05:54] <SomersaultJustice> oh no pat has the persona fever

[0:06:04] <%DensityD> he never stopped having it
[0:06:15] <%spiritofmojave> Everything is eggy now in AC, and that bunny SUCKS
[0:06:18] <StarlitStunner> stripBad Time to be cool a do crimes, also Pregnancy @patstaresat
[0:06:21] <%spiritofmojave> get it out of here
[0:06:23] <%Theycallmenerf> @sgrim Look up the clip of Isaac from Castlevania season 3 of dealing with humans and why he sided with Dracula, that’s how I handle Karen’s internally.
[0:06:23] <%CaptainPileDriver> okay
[0:06:26] <cureneckbeard> yeyeye
[0:06:27] <%optimasmaximas> YEYE
[0:06:27] <%CaptainPileDriver> now we starting
[0:06:29] <+schlager087> @clintonificent ah word, honestly I was more excited for the combat mechanics and what it could mean for the future more than a it being re3
[0:06:29] <%DensityD> good job starotter, that's good ice cream
[0:06:30] <mr_gunn> It’s like that trend where people use ramen noodles to fix stuff, but instead of ramen noodles it’s eggs
[0:06:30] <%spiritofmojave> yeyeye
[0:06:39] <clintonificent> but its still good i recommend it to anyone who can spend $60 on a short game right now, if you can't then i would wait for a sale, you'd enjoy it more then
[0:06:41] <+NanoComputer> DID HE just start up?

[0:17:09] <%j0ustar> Pat "Huge Dong" Boivin
[0:17:09] <+kitkatcake> piss on his shoes and say "No one will ever believe you"
[0:17:10] <$Wafflum> "Don't act like you're not impressed!"

[0:17:22] <%extradopeness> I can’t deal with people that don’t respect boundaries
[0:17:23] <%Visorak6> That RE3 stream was great
[0:17:23] <fenrirmitsuki> BDP! BDP!
[0:17:24] <%Spec7re> You could have started a circle jerk
[0:17:25] <%PanicSwytch> Did u sleep well?
[0:17:25] <%Razputin217> "I don't mean to sound gay or nothin', but you have a nice cock."

[0:17:40] <$iaraCatunda> y'all just pee with everyone looking? I don't get urinals
[0:17:41] <%logoth_> Oh great a new meme image.
[0:17:41] <TheyCallMeVawn> RE3 worth the 60 or naw
[0:17:41] <%segonian> he may have like it.
[0:17:42] <%GabeSweetMan> TO BE CLEAR: All MAG events are very likely to be cancelled depending on how long The Troubles go. We've already indefinitely postponed our camping trip "MAGStock".
[0:17:43] <%Emperor_Machinus> Pee on him and then whisper "no one will believe this happened"
[0:17:43] <clintonificent> actually re1/re2 is spooky whereas re3 is just PANIC PANIC PANIC
[0:17:44] <Ipsenscastle> it was awesome when you beaned nemesis with that grenade in the first fight, well done
[0:17:49] <fenrirmitsuki> Weak, Pat.
[0:17:50] <+Grayhammatter> nemesis is pretty spooky
[0:17:51] <%dukenux> danmit
[0:17:52] <%CaptainPileDriver> i have to work today, Construction Retail, today sucks
[0:17:53] <dabeaminator> Yeah this seems low energy compared to the prego screamfest last time.
[0:17:53] <%SGrim> @iaraCatunda we can pee standing up, so we piss into what is basically a tiny sink with a porcelain wall behind it.
[0:17:54] <%MelBrooksKA> Just be Patted out
[0:17:55] <NoHoldsBarredProductions> I fell asleep so I'll have to catch the rest on the vod, how late did it go?
[0:17:56] <FackinCrazy> Streaming turn you into 2020 undertaker?
[0:17:56] <+SoundVoid> How is RE3?

[0:17:58] <%ShawnTK_> @PatStaresAt Pretty sure Gus at Roosterteeth also has a story of a fan following him into the bathroom at a con
[0:17:59] <clintonificent> re3 both the original and remake actually have a wildly different type of scary than re1/re2
[0:18:01] <%Shonen_hero> That vod is a monster. It's going to take me some time to watch all of it
[0:18:01] <%solidousstream> finish it again
[0:18:02] <%dukenux> i called it

[0:18:37] <fenrirmitsuki> Prego?
[0:18:39] <soraabora> Pat is buying P5R worth it?
[0:18:40] <%SGrim> @iaraCatunda but it does use less water, so it's more eco-friendly then a full tank flush.
[0:18:41] <+kitkatcake> It's low energy because Pat was up all night being sick because of the baby
[0:18:45] <%ironohki> Pat's mouth is powerful.
[0:18:47] <dabeaminator> I think I prefer the subway one, but it's still real good.

[0:25:43] <ArtoriasTheTrenchfighter> You have to rebel against being the VILLAINS of society, reforming yourself into heroes against the will of the assholes in charge. You don't rebel against society entirely, because that would be meaningful.
[0:25:45] <%DensityD> I don't like checking twitter, what did Paige name her Animal Crossing island in the end?
[0:25:46] <clintonificent> play persona 2 you coward

[0:26:33] <clintonificent> its like Nier 1
[0:26:34] <Shwepie> @chaumiester All prisons are meant to punish, even in the US. We hope that achieve some reform while they are in there, but they are in there as a form of punishment fist and foremost.

[0:45:55] <+Violated_Muffins> and now you made it sad...
[0:45:56] <%rumtumtugnutz> In high school, Pat was the basketball.

[0:46:13] <+twohitgood> I had enough friends for a ska band, though.
[0:46:16] <+aslfrasle> Friends, romance, jobs, good grades, support from those you care about. It's the ultimate fantasy.
[0:46:20] <clintonificent> isn't college in Japan super rough and real and thats why they do high school as wish fulfillment nostalgia thing? i remember hearing that somewhere
[0:46:21] <%GarbageNirvana> Kids dumb, it is known
[0:46:21] <+aslfrasle> Even without the super powers.
[0:46:29] <%topendbuzza> LUL

[0:46:34] <+toficque> what does it mean?
[0:46:34] <%honeyman18> Fair question, what's the creepy factor they added in here?
[0:46:35] <Darren716> Thats worse than having no friends
[0:46:38] <Ipsenscastle> I can't trust anyone who had friends in high school, they're clearly in on some sort of conspiracy
[0:46:42] <%Spec7re> I can barely read
[0:46:43] <+pyrojack6> was it a good ska band

[0:47:46] <%SoFarFetched> it is
[0:47:46] <%Mr_Pylon> Did he get mauled by a chiumpanzee?

[0:47:53] <%NovaKnightmare> KAMOSHIDA'S A FUCKIN MONSTER
[0:47:53] <+NiSoKr> He just fell down some stairs
[0:47:53] <clintonificent> they are resident evil injuries
[0:47:54] <%crimsonharvest> you can break your nose if you face block a spike but cmon
[0:47:54] <+mashinchaserr> where are your parents
[0:47:54] <Run44forrest> jesus dude

[0:47:59] <+pectusumbra> Those are exteme PERIOD
[0:48:00] <%Verd_254> it's blood sport volleyball obviously
[0:48:01] <%s1rcuit> @PatStaresAt he looks like he was just beaten in an alley
[0:48:01] <%hntronium> he tripped down a stairway of doorknobs
[0:48:02] <$daveronald> he walked into a door
[0:48:03] <%SoFarFetched> saKAWmoto
[0:48:03] <Ipsenscastle> he lost a fucking eye
[0:48:06] <%GabeSweetMan> FELL DOWN STAIRS
[0:48:07] <+dirtyh4rr1> I mean, he could' ve broken an arm as well
[0:48:07] <%honeyman18> How much is he beating them?
[0:48:08] <%megamonmon123> he just fell on the court
[0:48:08] <%solidousstream> NOT FOR EXTREME VOLLEYBALL THOUGH
[0:48:08] <CrazyMedicine> The volleyball was a bomb
[0:48:09] <%Nobrev> well kamoshida does beat the shit out of them outside of playing volleyball
[0:48:09] <+trunubus> He was using his face to spike the ball
[0:48:09] <reddpop_> sah kaw ma toe
[0:48:09] <+Taglog7> Volleyball sure is dangerous with all those doorknobs
[0:48:09] <Cyber_Dood> the ball had spikes
[0:48:12] <sjcodan> I WAS IN A CAR CRASH. THOSE ARE WORSE
[0:48:12] <wannabemoogle> Dude
[0:48:13] <%CappuccinoGuil> Not if you fill the volleyball with glass shards
[0:48:15] <clintonificent> its Snake after he got his eye beefed out by Ocelot
[0:48:15] <%angel949> Mishima straight up says no cares tho
[0:48:16] <%ZestyArsenic> practice running into cars
[0:48:17] <%GabeSweetMan> The air is heavier.....
[0:48:18] <+jjjdanny> a hammer
[0:48:19] <dabeaminator> He got thrown off the roof
[0:48:19] <KaitlynnHere> a pair of balls...
[0:48:20] <Artista_AF> he's playing the Shonen way
[0:48:22] <MomsForseti> @patstaresat No they're "fell into a doorknob" injuries.
[0:48:23] <%Spec7re> COWARD
[0:48:23] <wannabemoogle> Multiple ones
[0:48:23] <%zamzoph> you scurred?
[0:48:23] <Run44forrest> crashed into a volley ball
[0:48:23] <%Madbearv> he's beating him
[0:48:26] <%angel949> * no one
[0:48:26] <%s1rcuit> @PatStaresAt probably actual beatings
[0:48:26] <TioXyco> not just the ball
[0:48:27] <%TheShortSwede> jeesuz what the fuck did the teacher do to that student
[0:48:27] <+mem3_jesus> This man got hit by one of Kiryu’s Beast Style heat actions
[0:48:29] <%hntronium> cowardice
[0:48:29] <%solidousstream> @patstaresat he fell into a door
[0:48:29] <%MonsterEnvy> No Kamoshida likely just punches them and stuff
[0:48:31] <%SoFarFetched> ITS IN YOUR INJURIES
[0:48:32] <CrazyMedicine> Pat clearly haven't played volleyball
[0:48:34] <Jeemukun> the only thing that bothers me about the dub is how they pronouce names
[0:48:34] <%BonewheelVanguard> Practise getting your shit kicked in
[0:48:36] <%GabeSweetMan> YOUR FACE
[0:48:37] <Dragovus> YOU KNEW
[0:48:39] <Valentinius_Anodyne> Should've called him a coward B)
[0:48:40] <SkyPirateArcane> JUST SAY YOU SAW IT
[0:48:40] <%GabeSweetMan> And that's not an insult.
[0:48:46] <%GabeSweetMan> Your face IS the evidence.
[0:48:46] <%brickwall35> you knew?!
[0:48:47] <%zamzoph> beat a confession out of him!
[0:48:47] <+Fireside_Stories> Fist fight injuries it's like hockey in Japan I guess... -.-
[0:48:47] <%GarbageNirvana> Evidence is everything in high school court
[0:48:47] <clintonificent> yeah thats how it is
[0:48:49] <+schlager087> "you're a bitch and so was your brother"
[0:48:51] <+mashinchaserr> volleyballs hit hard
[0:48:52] <clintonificent> Volleyball is hardcore
[0:48:54] <Run44forrest> fell down the stairs. on his eye. every step
[0:48:55] <CrazyMedicine> monkaS
[0:48:57] <mrlastchance1> That man is blind
[0:48:57] <+toficque> DODGE BALL
[0:48:58] <%hawk_rush> you don't play volleyball unless you're head's been fucked up Kappa
[0:48:59] <CanadianAnimatorGuy> LUL
[0:49:01] <clintonificent> its a blood sport
[0:49:02] <%Spec7re> Extreme volleyball
[0:49:06] <+FortNothing> Playing volleyball with a medicine ball
[0:49:08] <%Dragon_Batman> It is true getting hit with one fucking sucks
[0:49:10] <dabeaminator> A bandage is a weak point
[0:49:10] <+Saanspoof> Fess up or we'll take your other eye
[0:49:12] <%sexdrugsvideogames> I bet he does drills to not get scared of the ball. he spikes them from a meter afar
[0:49:22] <%joylent_blue> bye Ryuji FeelsBadMan
[0:49:23] <Ipsenscastle> That's why volleyball girls are always horrifically disfigured
[0:49:27] <%TheShortSwede> Dude not even American Footballers get those type of inyuries
[0:49:28] <+dirtyh4rr1> Blasted in the face? Kappa
[0:49:29] <clintonificent> no you have played coward volleyball
[0:49:31] <%zamzoph> I've gotten nailed in the face with a baseball
[0:49:33] <+kitkatcake> I broke my nose in volleyball, one of the girls broke her arm. volleyball is a deathsport
[0:49:33] <clintonificent> not REAL volley bol
[0:49:35] <+mam919> The volleyball gauged his eyes out
[0:49:37] <%KaiserMario> He just had a bad slip...
[0:49:37] <putnampuppeteer> could be a jacked-up cornea, too.
[0:49:39] <%cvp5127> find haru or makoto
[0:49:39] <soraabora> volleyball injuries are usually legs thought right?
[0:49:39] <clintonificent> where KNIVES come out
[0:49:40] <dreamfillah> A basketball to the face sucks huge amounts
[0:49:41] <KaitlynnHere> i've had taken so many soccer balls to the face... i usually don't even get a bruise
[0:49:42] <OmniSTylez> did you just phase through that student>?
[0:49:44] <StarlitStunner> Face blast
[0:49:47] <+linSP> Do not look up volleyball injuries I swear they get it worse than football
[0:49:48] <%GabeSweetMan> What's even more absurd is it's like he's keying his own car. WHY BEAT YOUR TEAM MEMBERS? You're literally reducing your own performance.
[0:49:49] <%Dragon_Batman> I could only imagine it's more that it happens constantly
[0:49:49] <+RowenCleric> did Pat try any of the other modes in RE3 and give his impressions on them?
[0:49:51] <%Spec7re> All over Pats face
[0:49:51] <%joylent_blue> got bitched
[0:49:53] <Run44forrest> football damage is on the inside daph2head
[0:49:53] <+Fireside_Stories> If you can spike a wrench you can spike a volleyball
[0:49:53] <%starotter70> Shove Mishima into a locker
[0:49:56] <%megamonmon123> yep
[0:49:58] <%crimsonharvest> get bitched on
[0:49:59] <%TheJaydedFox> He deserves it
[0:50:01] <%topendbuzza> paper girl best girl
[0:50:02] <+jjjdanny> Mishima deserves it
[0:50:03] <%SirGO0SE> i love a good hard bitching
[0:50:03] <+pectusumbra> I mean even your team hard ditches him
[0:50:06] <+pyrojack6> push mishima in a river
[0:50:06] <%MakotoPB> the ball is not the worst part of injuries, the floor is the biggest culprit
[0:50:06] <soraabora> I like mishima
[0:50:08] <%Shonen_hero> Give Mishima a wedgie
[0:50:08] <ItsAGundamu> how far is pat in?
[0:50:11] <mrlastchance1> That's a haaaaaaaaaaard bitch
[0:50:11] <+NitronStreams> Bitched right in the face
[0:50:12] <clintonificent> i love all of the Moon S-Links in this game cuz they are all awful people
[0:50:13] <%Aracon_> the game doesn't do much to make me like mishima
[0:50:16] <%GabeSweetMan> He's a binch.
[0:50:18] <soraabora> he's an abuse victum, he has trama issues
[0:50:19] <clintonificent> in the series*
[0:50:21] <%arancet> mishima is probably the most real character in the game
[0:50:21] <OmniSTylez> i heard. a rumor that mishima might like it
[0:50:22] <%UW_Duncan> 3-c is on 1st floor Pat
[0:50:23] <SkyPirateArcane> He kinda turns into a massive cunt though
[0:50:24] <%Mornaka> Mishima is a Herb
[0:50:25] <%Shonen_hero> Mishima is just Millhouse. Prove me wrong!
[0:50:26] <+mem3_jesus> Mishima gets dunked on like he’s a basketball net
[0:50:26] <%starotter70> OH YEAH
[0:50:29] <%Dragon_Batman> It really is
[0:50:30] <%MonsterEnvy> The injuries are not actually from Volleyball Kamoshida is just punching them and stuff. Volleyball is just the excuse.
[0:50:31] <%topendbuzza> why not max them all?
[0:50:31] <%MelBrooksKA> My cousin was hit by a pop fly baseball when we were at a baseball game as kids, that went really bad
[0:50:32] <%DensityD> You ever done Karaoke, Mr pat? as a social event?
[0:50:36] <wannabemoogle> He's a puppy who needs training
[0:50:36] <dabeaminator> His S-Link is basically about preventing a school shooter from developing.
[0:50:36] <Run44forrest> @itsagundamu very early
[0:50:37] <%Totally_not_toby> mishima die challenge
[0:50:38] <clintonificent> gourmet king, ai ebihara, and mishima is a hell of an Arcana
[0:50:38] <Asturax> I really like how populated the spaces in this game are
[0:50:39] <dreamfillah> Anyone ever sprained your fingers trying to pass a volley/basketball
[0:50:39] <OmniSTylez> LUL
[0:50:42] <+NiSoKr> But the bonuses though
[0:50:43] <%Slayer875> Mishima's confidant storyline was kinda cool to begin with
[0:50:44] <%topendbuzza> just do it
[0:50:46] <%Garthunox> use a guide
[0:50:46] <soraabora> not with that attitude
[0:50:47] <Valentinius_Anodyne> Do it tho
[0:50:49] <%sexdrugsvideogames> in volleyball you get knee protectors. but since you are using your arm to hit the ball you cant soften you falls
[0:50:50] <OldManDeckardCain> isn't mishima automatic? LUL
[0:50:52] <%UW_Duncan> 3C is on first floor
[0:50:55] <%cherrycottontail> do fortune first, it will solo al lthe relationships for you
[0:50:55] <lordzaskez> it's not
[0:50:55] <%zamzoph> nothing at all...
[0:50:56] <%Rumbutt> Third years are on the first floor oroLUL
[0:50:58] <%NovaKnightmare> Maxing out some is more satisfying than others
[0:50:59] <shouttothevoid> If you're not religiously following a spreadsheet are you really even playing Persona
[0:51:03] <+pectusumbra> It's a good confidant in all. You were just complaining about XP woes. And he does go through an arc.
[0:51:07] <Run44forrest> mishima throws a fit AND YOUR RANK GOES UP
[0:51:07] <+Ramsus88> it's not that bad to max if you rush fortune teller lady
[0:51:08] <%NovaKnightmare> FUCK Ohya tho
[0:51:16] <%MonsterEnvy> @PatStaresAt You are at the wrong floor 3rd years are floor 1
[0:51:16] <%hntronium> chat is your guide
[0:51:16] <%starotter70> That's understandable
[0:51:17] <%GabeSweetMan> For quizzes and tests, sure.
[0:51:18] <%FacetiousAF> you cant max all of them in a blind run, nerds
[0:51:19] <%Master_Van> 3rd years are on first floor
[0:51:20] <%zamzoph> just like real relationships!
[0:51:21] <Valentinius_Anodyne> Yeah that's fair
[0:51:22] <+Taglog7> It's the reason why I never finished the game. You reach the letter, and the team doesn't wanna hang out anymore.
[0:51:22] <+jjjdanny> LUL
[0:51:22] <lionmanguy> THAT'S where the mind goblins end?
[0:51:22] <+Grayhammatter> oh god, i need the fortune teller SO BAD
[0:51:22] <+dirtyh4rr1> 3-C
[0:51:23] <%Slayer875> What about the get smoked kid
[0:51:24] <+Carpe_Deez_Nuts> When u get to know Mishima, you realize that Kamoshida was the hero all along
[0:51:24] <OmniSTylez> nice
[0:51:24] <%megamonmon123> yeah I feel you chat
[0:51:24] <%Urdunngurdunn> it is fake
[0:51:25] <+pyrojack6> BUT ITS FAKE THO
[0:51:26] <mrlastchance1> Why does everyone shit on Ohya tho?
[0:51:26] <clintonificent> i very much like how most of the s links are related to the plot in some way unlike p3 and p4
[0:51:26] <%riantDeliration> im amazed thats not a goblin actually, nice
[0:51:27] <%Verd_254> it's earned
[0:51:27] <+chaumiester> but..... the Fortune cheat
[0:51:28] <%GabeSweetMan> Quizzes and tests are just free points.
[0:51:29] <quietshun> I use a guide for just the answers
[0:51:31] <%honeyman18> Fair
[0:51:34] <%hawk_rush> nah, fuck em freshmans
[0:51:35] <dabeaminator> It's not super hard to pick the right ones on your own.
[0:51:36] <%Aracon_> awwww shiho
[0:51:37] <%Dragon_Batman> You totally can max in one, it's hard
[0:51:40] <%hawk_rush> make them climb higher
[0:51:40] <%FacetiousAF> the trophies are also fake and i want those
[0:51:41] <+pectusumbra> Not to mention, if Phantom Thieves were real, tell me you all wouldn't be all up in that shit
[0:51:41] <hat_under_bread> Nah. Seniors get preferential treatment.
[0:51:42] <%Shonen_hero> It's balanced that way I guess.
[0:51:43] <%sexdrugsvideogames> how do you do fortune? i got intelligence first because i sudied all the time
[0:51:44] <%MonsterEnvy> No it's make the freshmen climb
[0:51:45] <%Spec7re> He is right behind you!
[0:51:46] <%GabeSweetMan> Shiho gets it THE WORST.
[0:51:49] <zeif00> Did you find the turtle fucking the rock in the school yet?
[0:51:51] <%zamzoph> shiho Kreygasm
[0:51:52] <%hntronium> third years get first floor because fuck the lower levels
[0:51:54] <%probablypoisonous> probablypoisonous subscribed at Tier 1. They've subscribed for 11 months, currently on a 11 month streak! Does the 5 second rule apply to soup? Please hurry
[0:51:55] <Ipsenscastle> Shiho's a good egg
[0:51:58] <mrlastchance1> Shiho gets it so fucking bad
[0:52:00] <%Typhaeon> Don't I know it
[0:52:01] <+Taglog7> SHIHO Kreygasm shoulda been extra char
[0:52:02] <+Grayhammatter> shiho gets it real bad, but she's the good egg
[0:52:03] <%hawk_rush> TRUTH
[0:52:05] <%DensityD> says pat
[0:52:05] <clintonificent> Shiho's plot is sort of similar to a character from P2
[0:52:05] <%GabeSweetMan> You need to learn to take care of yourself before others.
[0:52:07] <%Aracon_> yeeeeaaaah FeelsBadMan
[0:52:08] <sjcodan> ALWAYS BE A HUGE BITCH
[0:52:08] <+HouseofNonsense> Mm, true man.

[0:52:09] <+jjjdanny> Shiho 😭
[0:52:09] <+NitronStreams> by the time you reach year 3 you cant climb the stairs anymore
[0:52:10] <%hawk_rush> WAIT, NO
[0:52:11] <Manmadeawesome> Shido should have had a social link
[0:52:12] <WanderingSwordsman> @patstaresat going to tell you now, you need to max the new confidant to get the royal ending
[0:52:12] <couch_potato_Ed_Boy> Yep
[0:52:13] <+dirtyh4rr1> Don't fall too hard shiho
[0:52:14] <RetributionP> can you find the new girl in the school?
[0:52:15] <Restainly> imma watch the whole RE3 run peace
[0:52:18] <%KaiserMario> @PatStaresAt Is having a relationship with the doctor in bad taste? I mean... she is an adult AND she tests you for illegal drugs... such a cool lady...
[0:52:19] <%Urdunngurdunn> kindness for weakness
[0:52:22] <Manmadeawesome> I meant shiho
[0:52:23] <Mrbaconator> pat when the plane is on fire make sure to push that baby over
[0:52:24] <%PunishedMercer_> wish shiho wasn't just there for big sadness.
[0:52:24] <%Shonen_hero> Nothing wrong with being assertive about you or your own intersts
[0:52:27] <%BonewheelVanguard> max that empathy
[0:52:27] <%Typhaeon> A mask isn't going to stop your body from pulping at 300 mph against the ground
[0:52:30] <%PunishedMercer_> cute character.
[0:52:34] <wannabemoogle> True. Which is why they need that Mom friend who guards them
[0:52:35] <%hawk_rush> oh okay, I thought you were going to say to leave everyone on the plane that's about to crash lUL
[0:52:35] <%brickwall35> it's because you'll pass out before you can help anyone else
[0:52:37] <Asturax> Take everyone else's masks to maximise survival
[0:52:38] <clintonificent> this game actually has a ton of inspiration and fanservice from P1 and P2 that i didn't even notice for a while
[0:52:42] <OmniSTylez> man i didnt know pat was super into persona before
[0:52:44] <+pyrojack6> did you break your leg WTF?
[0:52:44] <mrlastchance1> Is it ethical to date tae? No. Is it fun? mebe
[0:52:49] <+pkdragoon> requirements?
[0:52:56] <Iggeh0> eh you only need the one to see the ball
[0:52:58] <%Mr_Pylon> And a fully bandaged leg?!
[0:53:00] <%Ganerumo> Reason they tell people to wear their own mask first is that if you don't, you very quickly get delirious
[0:53:01] <clintonificent> corporate punishment

[1:00:05] <MKUltima> Little known fact, cats violate the conservation of matter by producing infinite hair
[1:00:06] <%angel949> EVERY ONE KNOWS it's so messed up
[1:00:06] <Warbot40> Is it a japanese thing?
[1:00:06] <%Spec7re> @BallerSwagBro9k Speaking from experience, its actually not
[1:00:09] <Asturax> what we call elmo is merely a glimpse at the fur world
[1:00:10] <%GabeSweetMan> KILL HIM ELMO
[1:00:11] <clintonificent> REFORM
[1:00:13] <%ShawnTK_> @BallerSwagBro9k No it fuckin ain't, just replace Volleyball with Football

[1:00:14] <%DensityD> love bite psaWink
[1:00:14] <%joylent_blue> SirFurther that their kids are being abused
[1:00:15] <WanderingSwordsman> they want their kids to get scholarships
[1:00:15] <soraabora> man as someone who had something simular happen at my school, yeah thats generally how these things go
[1:00:16] <fehraf> so like do Japanese parents fine with this abuse?
[1:00:18] <%arancet> @PatStaresAt you think elmos sleeping, but hes actually concentrating on his fur growth
[1:00:19] <+aslfrasle> @BallerSwagBro9k Actually more realistic than you'd think. Just look at Larry Nassar from MSU.
[1:00:20] <+nekodelic> @BallerSwagBro9k it's absolutely not
[1:00:20] <SkyPirateArcane> Nah I've seen this shit happen, it's not unrealistic at all
[1:00:20] <%solidousstream> Yeah they want their kid to be successful
[1:00:21] <%sexdrugsvideogames> the parents just want their kids out of their way
[1:00:21] <+ScrapSentinel> brizziNightNight

[1:00:30] <%BoomerUnchained> Ok Tommy
[1:00:31] <+Weeewer> Yeah if you replace volley ball with football this exact same scenario is very viable in the US
[1:00:31] <%Typhaeon> Don't listen to your internal Morgana
[1:00:40] <clintonificent> this game is a soap opera and i love it

[1:00:50] <SailingSaturn> @BallerSwagBro9k eg Japan postponed Olympic cancellation for economic gain so I can believe this cirNom

[1:13:41] <Wall1ce> doesn't matter if pedophiles haven't had sex with kids they deserve the bullet regardless
[1:13:44] <Japanfreak2595> Noble Himbo Ryuji
[1:13:45] <%DappercatEsquire> I fail to see the moral equivalence between punishing a sex criminal and being a sex criminal, but okay Ryuji.
[1:13:45] <+LandOfTheWay> i mean, you're not beating the shit out of and/or molesting people you're supposed to take care of, so not really, ryuji
[1:13:50] <mrlastchance1> I ike the idea of Ryuji being the guy who always says things in place of curse words. Frik and dang all day
[1:13:58] <oniwahoo> I mean, you'd be killing a guy who is abusing his students at worst, that's probably a net positive

[1:31:23] <Run44forrest> strongest
[1:31:24] <andrei11dr> I sure hope his not down with the Satan
[1:31:24] <+pixelmike> yeah disgustingly evil
[1:31:24] <atema128> Wow I’m impressed at how useless and awful these adults are.
[1:31:25] <%Shonen_hero> Like the first is the worst
[1:31:25] <OmniSTylez> true
[1:31:25] <DreamerTTV> Y U P
[1:31:25] <%GabeSweetMan> Not even CLOSE
[1:31:26] <%Diana869> hes the best one for evil
[1:31:26] <%Hellarussian> the biggest villain
[1:31:26] <%solzan2000> I agree
[1:31:27] <%Visorak6> Its personal, pat
[1:31:27] <+Jp3g95> They should have started with number 3 or 4
[1:31:27] <%Mr_Pylon> How dod that roof not have a fence>
[1:31:28] <%Typhaeon> yyyyeah
[1:31:29] <deviljhojho_> None can compare
[1:31:29] <%Aracon_> all the other villains are just.......normal adults
[1:31:30] <pheonix727> I think thats the point pat
[1:31:30] <inksmears> it's true
[1:31:30] <Daniel_Is_I> Villlain 1 is Scumfuck, the rest are just dirtbags
[1:31:31] <%spiritofmojave> It's true
[1:31:31] <%around_40_jobbers> BIG TRUE
[1:31:31] <%cvp5127> 3rd ones pretty bad
[1:31:32] <Jeemukun> third one is pretty bad
[1:31:32] <CanadianAnimatorGuy> BUT MCDONALDS THO
[1:31:33] <Swish20XX> Is that a bad thing to start strong
[1:31:33] <ClumzyDragon> nope he is the worst
[1:31:33] <%Omegaanimus> It gets you to believe in their cause early on
[1:31:34] <pureotome> yeah he's the strongest villain
[1:31:34] <%Dragon_Batman> None of em live up to em
[1:31:35] <$Trenr> holy shit dudes gotta die
[1:31:36] <shiny_prinny> It's like what Outer Worlds did
[1:31:36] <+GrassCannon> Kamoshida is an Akame ga Kill villain
[1:31:36] <%spiritofmojave> YEP
[1:31:36] <%Thirtine> its personal
[1:31:36] <Valentinius_Anodyne> Should've just killed Kamoshida like we first said
[1:31:37] <OmniSTylez> but it really sets up the characters good
[1:31:39] <Run44forrest> but didnt they """fix""" that
[1:31:40] <pixelkenj> but he DIDNT WIN THE OLYMPICS
[1:31:40] <%MonsieurHedge> i mean the painter guy is pretty bad since he's a straight up fucking serial murderer
[1:31:40] <%Laecerelius> second is pretty bad but yeah kamoshida is by far the worst
[1:31:40] <$Corporate_Redeemer> She looks pretty good for jumping from such a height
[1:31:40] <%solzan2000> the painter was ok
[1:31:41] <clintonificent> Space Dad is big corporation dude
[1:31:42] <+pixelmike> 3 is real rough
[1:31:42] <%Omegaanimus> their actions are more morally grey later on
[1:31:44] <%Aracon_> like literally this dude is the worst
[1:31:44] <Jeemukun> but yeah, kamoshida is waaaay to strong a strat
[1:31:45] <kratosdestroys> 3rd one was pretty bad
[1:31:45] <%za7az> GET em'
[1:31:45] <%CappuccinoGuil> GRAB MISHIMA
[1:31:46] <%zamzoph> he knows monkaS
[1:31:46] <%majindusto> WHY ARE THE ADULTS SO AWFUL?
[1:31:46] <+pectusumbra> It's because he's personal. Techincally the others are worse overall, but you fucking HATE Kamoshida
[1:31:47] <mrlastchance1> Like the rest are bad, but he's jsut disgusting
[1:31:47] <%FacetiousAF> none of them are as outright evil
[1:31:48] <%Diana869> lets stab him
[1:31:48] <%MonsterEnvy> I think a few of them are bit mroe evil
[1:31:49] <+michingmallecho> He’s gotta go
[1:31:49] <+Taglog7> Futaba's friends Parents
[1:31:49] <%foreverN2dust> yeyeye beat his ass
[1:31:50] <%CappuccinoGuil> TACKLE HIM
[1:31:50] <putnampuppeteer> WATERBOARD 'IM
[1:31:50] <+Story_Ark> it would have been better like p4 where its one overall villain
[1:31:50] <omen_setter> Not only is he evil, he's also realistically evil.
[1:31:51] <%Visorak6> THE BLOB
[1:31:53] <+nekodelic> @shiny_prinny pretty much
[1:31:53] <+Arkfyre> For sure, kamoshida is just super vile, and the other villains don't have that same evilness to them
[1:31:53] <%spiritofmojave> And has the school under his thumb, he's probably the worst out of all the cast
[1:31:54] <soraabora> it gives a sense of urgency
[1:31:55] <andrei11dr> Not even Satan
[1:31:55] <+zafooru> blobbo
[1:31:55] <%Thirtine> 2nd guy did allow people to die too tho
[1:31:56] <$iaraCatunda> the others are equally awful but you have like no connection to them
[1:31:56] <pixelkenj> it gives your spark of motivation
[1:31:56] <ClumzyDragon> ya true
[1:31:56] <Dragovus> He knows about Metal Gear
[1:31:57] <+michingmallecho> HES GOTTA PAY hasSmash
[1:31:57] <+Grayhammatter> oh yeah
[1:31:58] <+aslfrasle> BREAK HIS LEGS LIKE WHAT HAPPENED TO RYUJI
[1:32:00] <+Ramsus88> the rest are more systematic villains, not as personal
[1:32:00] <%Hellarussian> Wilson Fisk is the principal?
[1:32:00] <%FlakkLIVE> Yeah man, Kamoshida definitely is way worse than anything later
[1:32:03] <oniwahoo> Yeah, best Mishima's ass! Get the truth out of him!
[1:32:03] <clintonificent> yes very good adventure motive
[1:32:06] <%FlakkLIVE> But I do think it was needed
[1:32:08] <%GabeSweetMan> I genuinely feel Ann is one of the best written characters.
[1:32:10] <%Dragon_Batman> The rest of em have some huge villainous stuff but it's not as personal as here
[1:32:11] <%GarbageNirvana> Morgana just hanging out at the top there
[1:32:11] <%Typhaeon> *inquisitive meowing*
[1:32:12] <+pixelmike> 3 is worse then kamoshida for me because 3 does that shit just because
[1:32:12] <%MonsterEnvy> I think Shido is worse
[1:32:13] <+TalekAetem> How far is Pat in?
[1:32:13] <NiktenKing> I mean the mob boss was also pretty evil, but you don't have a real personal reason that hits you
[1:32:14] <%Spec7re> psaElmo psaElmo psaElmo psaElmo
[1:32:15] <$iaraCatunda> harus father is so nothing
[1:32:15] <deviljhojho_> RYUJI FURY
[1:32:15] <+machinetoys> wait doesn't the third guy friend to pimp out teenagers?
[1:32:16] <clintonificent> like "oh we must begin the JRPG"
[1:32:16] <%hntronium> why you running bitch?
[1:32:18] <$Corporate_Redeemer> He also broke Ryuji's leg so yeah, SUPER EVIL
[1:32:18] <Valentinius_Anodyne> Good cop bad cop
[1:32:18] <%indig0bird> FESS UP CUNT
[1:32:18] <+LandOfTheWay> shido's good competition just cause of the level he's working on. political assassinations, government coup, etc.
[1:32:19] <%zamzoph> @PatStaresAt frontloading the game, like games often do
[1:32:20] <%foreverN2dust> psaPorgmo meooooow
[1:32:20] <%Omegaanimus> This starts out personal for the, they aren't totally the noble crusaders they THINK they are
[1:32:20] <%BoomerUnchained> smash his nuts
[1:32:23] <+mrkatmonarchy> hey man, kamoshida did nothing wrong
[1:32:24] <%za7az> sipsipHellmo
[1:32:24] <+Grayhammatter> he is literally like 5 days in
[1:32:25] <+FadingEmber> The first dungeon of this game felt like a chore to get threw because of that bastard
[1:32:28] <dabeaminator> The problem is everything feels less serious after this
[1:32:28] <clintonificent> these Stardust Crusaders
[1:32:28] <%FacetiousAF> TWIST HIS DICK
[1:32:29] <%Omegaanimus> Even Ryuji early on talks about how this is more about revenge
[1:32:32] <%CalderGaming> "called out"
[1:32:32] <Run44forrest> YOURE NEXT MISHIMA
[1:32:32] <+drsaltneo> the next villain is the same sans rape
[1:32:34] <Valentinius_Anodyne> For real?
[1:32:35] <%solidousstream> I know I was there with my video camera
[1:32:38] <%Hellarussian> OH NOOO
[1:32:38] <+ryujinran> And somehow people think that he’s comparable to kawakami?
[1:32:39] <%GarbageNirvana> psaPorgmo psaPorgmo psaPorgmo
[1:32:39] <$iaraCatunda> Me too Elmo
[1:32:41] <%Thirtine> its not like madarame or okumura werent abusive too, but we werent as close to them
[1:32:41] <%MonsterEnvy> Madarame and Okumura are also pretty awful.
[1:32:41] <%PanicSwytch> ELMO SCREM
[1:32:42] <%spiritofmojave> @gabesweetman she can totally be up there, I hope this gives her way more time outside of just the strong bits in the start stages of the game
[1:32:42] <Warbot40> The others are equally terrible but they're not nearly as blunt or personal.
[1:32:43] <Mattais88> masima got the dick too
[1:32:43] <%Omegaanimus> they start out looking for revenge and kind of justify it all as they go along
[1:32:45] <%EndlessScrapper> yeah he is the scummy of them but the yakuza guy is a slave trader that will drug and rape children and the semi final boss has killed an untold number of people
[1:32:45] <%Spec7re> HOLY SHIT
[1:32:46] <%FlakkLIVE> Yeah Shido's definitely driven people to suicide for sure
[1:32:47] <%indig0bird> psaDab Stab him IN MINECRAFT psaDab

[1:32:59] <Rabicwill> oh god the adults here really are bad huh

[1:33:03] <vonmaultke> Grab his dick and twist it!
[1:33:03] <%zamzoph> monkaS
[1:33:05] <%PlainSimpleTailor> Is this the Japanese education system for realsies, though?
[1:33:08] <+Story_Ark> like in p4, the culprit is unknown for most of the game and once you find out you really wanna kick his ass. kamoshida is like that but he's just in the first portion
[1:33:08] <%Aracon_> sonuvabitch

[1:33:21] <lionmanguy> Man you don't even need to kill, just breaking like one leg so he never plays again is poetic justice enough

[3:13:14] <Run44forrest> i hated makoto and then she fucking POPPED OFF
[3:13:19] <This_is_Marco> @clintonificent the voice actor from dmc?
[3:13:21] <+justianxix> Makoto's punch grill, what's not to like
[3:13:25] <Dr_Mooose> ^
[3:13:27] <%spiritofmojave> Did Canada seriously get FF7 before hs
[3:13:28] <Japanfreak2595> Futaba is overrated as a dating option
[3:13:33] <%spiritofmojave> damn leafs
[3:13:39] <clintonificent> @This_is_Marco not the voice actor but just general aura, she looks a lot like Lady and rides a motorcycle
[3:13:41] <%Dhurkst> @boneskore same, makoto is just a bitch
[3:13:44] <fairore> @japanfreak2595 LUL
[3:13:44] <Run44forrest> futabers hasWeird
[3:13:45] <+SpicyCheeseNips> Makoto's cool, but I didn't really find her hot or nothing.
[3:13:46] <+projectmanatees> are we all simps for liking video game waifus?
[3:13:50] <This_is_Marco> @clintonificent ahh gotcha
[3:13:50] <TurtlesAndTentacles> Kawakami all the way
[3:13:51] <sadolerlaqreet1> Futaba is a disgusting neet what a foul creature
[3:13:53] <clintonificent> Kawakami, then Tae, then Makoto
[3:13:54] <KishinGrek> Makoto is like mitsuru but better
[3:13:55] <%Omegaanimus> Makoto as a romance is what you call a long term relationship investment
[3:13:57] <hatuhsawl> What song is this
[3:13:58] <%Spec7re> Futaba is okay
[3:14:03] <BoneSkore> @dhurkist THANK YOU
[3:14:05] <%solidousstream> but but Dr mommy?
[3:14:08] <clintonificent> i actually don't hate any of the romances in this game
[3:14:10] <clintonificent> unlike 3 and 4
[3:14:14] <Japanfreak2595> In general Futaba is rad

[3:14:29] <%Omegaanimus> Just a reminder that in the anime Ohya takes Joker to the fucking horse track for V-day
[3:14:29] <clintonificent> haru's voice acting is weird she needs to be like 10 octaves lower
[3:14:31] <sadolerlaqreet1> We aren’t simps but people on federal watchlists
[3:14:32] <Run44forrest> haru iis way too rich to be dressing like shit
[3:14:40] <NJigglypuff> @projectmanatees only if you defend them for their own approval, which they cant really give so whatever
[3:14:41] <Run44forrest> @Diana869 of course
[3:14:41] <ManOfReason> Fuck haru Kappa
[3:14:48] <%Omegaanimus> Ohya has the romantic tastes of a 1950's middle aged man

[3:20:43] <Run44forrest> remember when the break song was beneath the mask FeelsBadMan
[3:20:46] <clintonificent> never, it should just be ported to everything, its perfect as is
[3:20:47] <%Dragon_Batman> That game is perfect
[3:20:55] <%rumtumtugnutz> ....Is the video suddenly faster?
[3:21:08] <%yourliteraldog> @justianxix Its called dq 11
[3:21:12] <+GriffeNOTD> Dude you guys already get the scene where the characters literally teleport in?
[3:21:28] <clintonificent> they mentioned it on the podcast but you can definitely make FF7 better with technology but you CANT make CT better its just perfect as is
[3:21:29] <Daskolin> DID pat order new gamer cube product? Gamer box?!

[3:22:42] <+CelioHogane> @valachi yes with that story
[3:22:53] <clintonificent> @valachi if it does end up disappointing, I'm just glad they made it a lot different like they did with RE3R, that way I can just appreciate it for what it is (or not appreciate), and just play the original if its bad
[3:23:03] <worldbrand> im used to your other awful opinions in chat so this doesnt faze me even as a hifumi fan
[3:23:12] <valachi> If I wanted a sequel to Advent Children I'd shoot myself @CelioHogane
[3:23:15] <clintonificent> hifumi is kinda rad
[3:23:19] <+kevlarkoala> when will the cowards in Japan recognize the power of PC and give me Persona on PC?

[3:26:23] <%NoHoldsBarredProductions> Delivery man delivered the pornography to the pornography store instead of to Pat, and since there's a pandemic, Pat is without his pornography. And so ends the sad tale of Pat and his pornography.

[3:30:13] <valachi> @Garthunox fair
[3:30:15] <+cereal_box_conspiracy> if they pick up boxes, aren't they the opposite of a delivery?

[3:30:28] <wannabemoogle> People dumb
[3:30:32] <%dekkitout> @Japanfreak2595 Yeah, that's usually the trajectory here- sometimes it goes to furry stuff, but yeah...
