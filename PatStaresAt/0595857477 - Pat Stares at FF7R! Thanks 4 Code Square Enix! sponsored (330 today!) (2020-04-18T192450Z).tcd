[0:03:41] <%CursedNobleman> he liked the game? so what
[0:03:52] <%abusywizard> So glad Max finished it last night/this morning so I can finally look at chat without fear of being spoiled
[0:03:55] <%weissguard> It's probably just him memeing for a joke.

[0:54:12] <%Alopekis> It's cause it doesn't have all those neon lights making everything look nice
[0:54:12] <%Typhaeon> Darkness conceals quite a lot of rot
[0:54:12] <%Yummy_Nukes> VEGAS BABY
[0:54:13] <%rufus2k2> how do you think Vegas looks in the day?
[0:54:13] <%ALazo> Just like Las Vegas
[0:54:14] <%Sir_stride> so like Las Vegas in the day time
[0:54:18] <%KasiCrafter> It's THEMATIC garbage. Like the hangover you get in the morning.
[0:54:22] <%floralkami> isn't that like, every tourist location?
[0:54:23] <%MonsterEnvy> Most Night Distircts look shitty during the day
[0:54:23] <%Legato_Ambrose> I mean... It's still the slums, ye?
[0:54:23] <%j0ustar> Neon lights exist to distract you from the poop
[0:54:27] <%logoth_> Midgar doesnt look like Midgar during the day
[0:54:28] <%radiocrawler> I truly hope they touch up this game in time for PC release.
[0:54:32] <%boogaleeboo> Yeah that sums it up
[0:54:33] <%heartlesshealer> well yeah
[0:54:36] <%koraialstrasz> Las Vegas smells like chlorine
[0:54:37] <%ringabal> To be fair, Twin Peaks music makes anything creepy
[0:54:37] <%sporeian94> side quests feel real tacked on and pointless. like theres what 20 side quests?
[0:54:45] <%ape_hawk> dumb people are distracted by pretty lights, like you
[0:54:45] <%Aydarkzero> guess thats why so many people like RGB on the PC Kappa
[0:54:46] <%Dragon_Batman> Awww ye

[0:54:51] <%PocketChange117> wtf

[0:57:14] <%j0ustar> Can we retcon Gackt?

[0:57:58] <%floralkami> what was Gackt's bullshit again? it was in Advent Children, or Crisis Core?
[0:57:58] <%rufus2k2> Watch Genesis be a Battle simulator fight
[0:57:59] <%Alopekis> He's getting high on his own supply
[0:58:02] <%boogaleeboo> I'd love them forever if literally Gackt shows up, not as Genesis just himself
[0:58:04] <%Javaa01> psaElmo

[1:06:41] <%Caped_Eggy> He's ok
[1:06:44] <%Aracon_> he's a pretty stand up guy
[1:06:44] <%Typhaeon> I find it hard to reconcile him with Corneo being a sex slaver, and him sort of playing along
[1:06:51] <%SaiyanShoto> The trio is great
[1:06:51] <%HRDSalami654> Fun fact, pull ups are actually more about the back muscles than any other part of the body.
[1:06:54] <%Fenrirlives> The Trio were all really great additions
[1:06:55] <%Dragon_Batman> Don't do him, I did the same
[1:06:55] <%rufus2k2> for real, despite Tifa punching robots barehanded, i kind of see from this characterization how she could get in a slapfight with Scarlet
[1:06:56] <%KawaiiJetty> Tifa was so into it, Andrea is good
[1:06:56] <%floralkami> not yet, the soreness comes in like a day or two without proper hydration and stretching
[1:06:57] <%Keyd00d> No
[1:06:59] <%Zombrocom> @Typhaeon Yeah that still bothers me
[1:07:00] <%Keyd00d> Oh
[1:07:01] <%ConLin_Arts_> no
[1:07:01] <%valriot> Man, its almost as if new stuff can be just as good as the old stuff Kappa
[1:07:02] <%TheFabledAble> He is lovely <3 him and jules are like peak soft boi yet strong vibes
[1:07:02] <%ringabal> WRONG ONE PAT
[1:07:06] <%Keyd00d> Same one you just did
[1:07:06] <%ConLin_Arts_> it is trainee
[1:07:07] <%CelioHogane> Oh, another champion belt.
[1:07:07] <%coreybom> That’s a kinda weird laugh.
[1:07:09] <%heartlesshealer> same difficulty oops
[1:07:10] <%rolfalex> no
[1:07:15] <%albret__einstrong> this guy is big e langston
[1:07:19] <%Typhaeon> Oh Ronald, you still suck
[1:07:20] <%realm_forge> He’s the best slam pig in the business
[1:07:21] <%KasiCrafter> Eh, he needs the practice anyhow.
[1:07:23] <%Movemeister> SourPls
[1:07:23] <%Ultimatefool> Eh, Pat will need the practice for expert
[1:07:24] <%Koush> @valriot Kappa
[1:07:28] <%j0ustar> Pull-ups > Marlene being abducted
[1:07:29] <%rolfalex> you get nothing
[1:07:30] <%Aracon_> pat's gonna need the practice
[1:07:31] <%unstablebeast19> you were supposed to challenge jay, not ronnie
[1:07:36] <%sporeian94> this IS hard
[1:07:37] <%Dragon_Batman> I did the same
[1:07:38] <%Typhaeon> This one seems a lot more strict about pressing buttons quickly
[1:07:39] <%ImmaCanuck> f
[1:07:42] <%siamzero94> two rounds
[1:07:44] <%ShichiNoBushi> Wrong guy, though.
[1:07:44] <%Alopekis> PAT LOST
[1:07:45] <%boogaleeboo> two rounds
[1:07:54] <%amiroodude> pull ups harder than squats confirmed
[1:07:57] <%boogaleeboo> It's only the wrong guy if he wins
[1:08:03] <%Keyd00d> incoming realization
[1:08:03] <%Aracon_> hardest part is remembering the pattern for me
[1:08:04] <%radiocrawler> psaPorgmo psaPorgmo psaPorgmo
[1:08:06] <%Felto3> why is he doing amateur again
[1:08:09] <%Dragon_Batman> My problem was always my thumb wanted to roll instead of crisscross
[1:08:15] <%Aracon_> my brain turns to miush after a while
[1:08:27] <%rufus2k2> as pat ignore rhythm and just "does it"
[1:08:29] <%Keyd00d> Wrong difficulty
[1:08:29] <%ImmaCanuck> PJSalt
[1:08:34] <%KasiCrafter> Guitar Hero Expert Syndrome, huh?
[1:08:38] <%floralkami> god, i will NEVER get over how bad their forms are, especially with Jules encouraging that shit.
[1:08:38] <%rufus2k2> because pat doesn't know what rhythm is
[1:08:42] <%Dragon_Batman> Yep
[1:08:43] <%TalisKanju> Ronnie is an anime villain
[1:08:44] <%Daxalog> 1-2--3-4
[1:08:44] <%mechslayer71> When it’s fast you can just mash it
[1:08:45] <%vincerocmm> psa3guy psa2guy psa1guy

[1:09:02] <%Keyd00d> wow
[1:09:03] <%VioletHeart> Did Pat just select amateur again?
[1:09:05] <%rufus2k2> he actually reminds me of Sabin
[1:09:10] <%Keyd00d> Amateur is the right one
[1:09:12] <%albret__einstrong> @VioletHeart yes
[1:09:17] <%SaiyanShoto> Circle, square, triangle
[1:09:17] <%realm_forge> Make him your slam pig
[1:09:20] <%mechslayer71> @violetheart First one was rookie
[1:09:21] <%heartlesshealer> wow he sped up
[1:09:24] <%siamzero94> oh boy
[1:09:24] <%VioletHeart> Oh right.
[1:09:27] <%Alopekis> Oh shit
[1:09:27] <%akaAxi0m> I still don't understand how this is supposed to work, like what the queues are supposed to be because it doesn't feel like it matches the beat at all.
[1:09:31] <%VioletHeart> I didn't know there was a rank below amateur.
[1:09:37] <%Keyd00d> There is no beat
[1:09:38] <@mothmandraws> ff7 raid tier has this as savage mechanic
[1:09:44] <%Trair> Trair subscribed with Twitch Prime. They've subscribed for 10 months! hope youre doing well. just got a logitech g915 and g502 with my stimulus. wireless 4 life
[1:09:45] <%Felto3> the cue is the animation

[1:09:58] <%mechslayer71> @akaaxi0m The speed slowly increases. It’s a timing game, not a rhythm one
[1:09:58] <%NitronStreams> YEAH

[1:11:35] <@mothmandraws> jules isnt doing pull ups, hes pulling roof down to him, too strong
[1:11:37] <%Nope80808> You need to hit around fourty to beat him
[1:11:37] <%SGrim> 21 to 11. THIS CLOSE psaBig
[1:11:37] <%broth_elemental> You need to hit at least 20 in phase 1 and like 45 overall

[1:11:59] <%delilah4you> Pat, don't concentrate on him, concentrate on how many reps you get. He will always get between 40 - 44 reps, max had to get 45 to beat him.
[1:11:59] <%reinbachthe3rd> That shit ain't even fair.
[1:12:01] <%ScreamLord> @PatStaresAt Yeah Paige's own body is trying to kill itself so I don't think she's the best example to gauge athletic women with huge titters

[1:12:55] <%VHGS> Can't underestimate THE Beautiful Bro.
[1:12:59] <%Felto3> but you can only mess up at the start/end
[1:12:59] <%flamingmonkies2> enjoy the annoying load time to back out of it
[1:13:00] <%Daxalog> Would love a quick retry

[1:13:05] <%Koush> psaBig psaDown
[1:13:06] <%akaAxi0m> Can we get Jules in the party. Need a grappler to suplex trains.
[1:13:07] <%sirisvirus> about a 30 second load
[1:13:09] <%gaomachine> I still say he looks like Matt hardy
[1:13:10] <%supersugoisenpai1> PS5
[1:13:11] <%ShichiNoBushi> A "Restart" option would be appreciated.
[1:13:13] <%ImmaCanuck> I wonder why Kappa
[1:13:13] <%GohanHitsugaya> Loading times suck in this game.
[1:13:15] <%boogaleeboo> And the losing is, in itself, practice
[1:13:16] <%Quigsies> Even just PS5 will be way better
[1:13:18] <%Legato_Ambrose> With the big cheats?
[1:13:19] <%Aydarkzero> yeah i'd play it again
[1:13:20] <%mechslayer71> I managed it the other day pat @patstaresat just keep at it and learn the flow of the presses
[1:13:22] <%Legato_Ambrose> and the big nudie mods?
[1:13:23] <%unstablebeast19> fuck sephiroth, juiles pull ups is the true enemy
[1:13:25] <%Firgof> The Round 2 Button Path Switch is also mean
[1:13:25] <%Dragon_Batman> Maybe

[1:13:37] <%Alopekis> Sephiroth wishes he was as powerful as Jules.
[1:13:37] <%Aracon_> still doable
[1:13:38] <%Caped_Eggy> Pat already lost

[1:14:35] <%Aydarkzero> don't look at his pecks Pat it's a distraction!
[1:14:38] <%ratreborn> this minigame is confusing, took me at least 10 times to beat this dont worry, youll get it
[1:14:39] <%ScottishMadJacko> 4th times the charm maybe
[1:14:40] <%optimasmaximas> WOW he kicked your ass
[1:14:41] <%heartlesshealer> Ignore Jules
[1:14:41] <%optimasmaximas> jesus
[1:14:42] <%Sir_stride> CHRIST LOOK AT HIM GO
[1:14:43] <%SaiyanShoto> It’s the hardest difficulty so of course you have to do it perfect, it’d be lame if it was easy
[1:14:45] <%Keyd00d> When does Jules join the party
[1:14:52] <%DukeBlack_> and he laughs at us
[1:14:53] <@StridentSong> Jules is the true final boss
[1:14:54] <%jessedouglas> Jules literally took me like an hour a few days ago it’s absolutely nuts
[1:14:55] <%optimasmaximas> dude trying to get a match in this beta sucks
[1:14:55] <%HotBloodedHero> You get slower as it speeds up too
[1:14:56] <%Dragon_Batman> I found it help me to visualize where the prompt goes
[1:14:57] <%Alopekis> One last pull up from Jules, just as a "fuck you."
[1:14:57] <%broth_elemental> after a while I turned the sound and voices down because they were distracting
[1:14:57] <%mechslayer71> A good place to be going into round 2 is 24 or 25, for context @patstaresat
[1:15:01] <%spiritofmojave> it is!
[1:15:02] <%realm_forge> psaDab
[1:15:07] <%gatoralus> damn we need to get jules on sephis ass
[1:15:10] <%siamzero94> OH GOD WE ARE GOING TO BE HERE FOR HOURS
[1:15:10] <%DukeBlack_> Don't look at Jules
[1:15:11] <%zenraider> toughest thing in the game lol
[1:15:14] <%Laecerelius> Jules will defeat Sephiroth and bring peace to the planet with the power of GAINS!
[1:15:14] <%KawaiiJetty> Nice to see Cloud and Barret cheering for Tifa 4Head
[1:15:17] <%Firgof> Nah, you can get super fast. You just have to look for the 'frame drop' on your animation, that'll let you know when you can hit it.
[1:15:18] <%DappercatEsquire> @patstaresat backdown, reward sucks
[1:15:20] <%flamingmonkies2> I suggest turning off in-game voice volume for this
[1:15:22] <%toastybites> Forget the children, get teh gains
[1:15:25] <%DukeBlack_> he's doing it
[1:15:25] <%Dragon_Batman> Yeyeyeyeye
[1:15:26] <%Keyd00d> I just want a Sephiroth squat and dance off
[1:15:27] <%Firgof> It's really tough to keep going up as it does though, makes it easier to fall off
[1:15:28] <%MonsterEnvy> you need 42
[1:15:31] <@mothmandraws> Jules should just benchpress meteor
[1:15:31] <%siamzero94> COME ON!
[1:15:36] <%SaiyanShoto> Backing down is for cowards!

[1:19:51] <%BubbaRands> Okay what I miss?
[1:19:51] <%SGrim> He gets anywhere from 41 to 44
[1:19:54] <%Aracon_> his screw ups are just so you can catch up lol
[1:19:54] <%Alopekis> He got 42 once
[1:19:56] <%Keyd00d> the only time you can screw up is right at the end of a round
[1:19:58] <%Firgof> @heartlesshealer when you press
[1:19:58] <%Felto3> he can get as low as 38
[1:19:58] <%Jamejarrs> Especially in the second round, he doesn't mess up
[1:20:04] <@StridentSong> He ranges between 39-45
[1:20:07] <%Dragon_Batman> You essentially have to beat 45

[1:30:57] <%Dragon_Batman> To be fair Chp 14 is side questing
[1:31:00] <%Zutrax> Just so you are aware, one of the side quests requires you to progress in the main story up until a "point of no return" in this chapter. You can do side content still after it as long as you don't go past the obvious warning. @PatStaresAt
[1:31:00] <%Alopekis> Make the living ones not living anymore

[1:31:31] <%mechslayer71> The song for this area is UNDERRATED
[1:31:31] <%cvp5127> pedo means feet?

[1:31:32] <%Engwithan_Elder_God> Latin
[1:31:33] <%optimasmaximas> LUL

[1:32:20] <%ScreamLord> @PatStaresAt Yeah I looked up a video of Don Corneo and yeah Fred Tatasciore sounds so much like Mark Hamill's Joker voice it's nuts
[1:32:21] <%heartlesshealer> I think you're not supposed to be melee barret for these
[1:32:22] <%imthewisejanitor> Yes.
[1:32:27] <%Typhaeon> Dunk that blowfish
[1:32:29] <%Aracon_> HE'S SO STRONG
[1:32:32] <%Alopekis> Barret is always the strongest
[1:32:32] <%Dragon_Batman> That charge is real good
[1:32:35] <%Typhaeon> This weapon fucking rules
[1:32:36] <%Tucker0603> DAYUM
[1:32:38] <%CelioHogane> HE CAN 1v1 HELL HOUSE (?)
[1:32:39] <%ape_hawk> no one can survive, THE CLAW
[1:32:41] <%Ultimatefool> REAL IMPACT
[1:32:43] <%rytyoung> hes
[1:32:44] <%Trair> Make sure you check the weapon vender in this area
[1:32:45] <%heartlesshealer> aww <3

[1:32:57] <%ScreamLord> Elmo is best doggo?
[1:32:59] <%DappercatEsquire> THIS SHIT WITH THE SLEEP AND STUNS IS WHAT I WAS TALKING ABOUT
[1:33:00] <%heartlesshealer> wow!
[1:33:02] <%NitronStreams> jeezus barrets hit boxes are huge
[1:33:02] <%Typhaeon> You kick that dog Barrett
[1:33:03] <%Dragon_Batman> I love that
[1:33:06] <%JoshyJ> so much better than weird skinny advent children barret
[1:33:08] <%broth_elemental> Barrett is my favorite character. he has an active reload that feels good to do
[1:33:09] <%CelioHogane> SHOOT DOG
[1:33:12] <%Sir_stride> MAX FURY BABY
[1:33:14] <%Laecerelius> Summon against these dogs!
[1:33:14] <%Engwithan_Elder_God> You can bring a summons to this fight?
[1:33:19] <%Keyd00d> not a good weapon for fast enemies
[1:33:20] <%valriot> Still prefer gun, especially with Refocus, that stuff is nuts
[1:33:20] <%Caped_Eggy> Cloud seems weak compare to the other members despite being a soldier
[1:33:31] <%CelioHogane> LEVIATHAN, KILL THIS SINGLE DOG
[1:33:31] <%Dragon_Batman> Is his deadly dodge still the same in this mode?
[1:33:35] <%Keyd00d> psaGib
[1:33:42] <%RAAAAAINMAKER> Fighting a Dog with a machine gun claw.... Big man
[1:33:47] <%Aracon_> elmo want attention
[1:33:52] <@SoFarFetched> Elmo want Barbacoa
[1:34:03] <%mechslayer71> @caped_eggy Physically? Yeah, Barret is huge and Tifa is a FREAK. FF world rules are weird
[1:34:05] <%Ultimatefool> Look at this planet lover murdering animals
[1:34:12] <%unstablebeast19> @caped_eggy really? i found him to be the strongest and preformed best as jim, maybe its just your playstyle
[1:34:16] <%heartlesshealer> he screm
[1:34:18] <%DukeBlack_> Deadly dodge on melee barret is the best
[1:34:21] <%CelioHogane> @Ultimatefool he is feeding the planet with Mako
[1:34:22] <%cvp5127> uh oh
[1:34:25] <%ape_hawk> @Ultimatefool hes returning them to the lifestream
[1:34:25] <%Alopekis> LOL
[1:34:25] <%valriot> Now melee was a bad idea LUL
[1:34:26] <%Metballs> HA
[1:34:27] <%Laecerelius> Oh no! Flying enemies, Barret's true enemy!
[1:34:27] <%heartlesshealer> LUL
[1:34:28] <%Keyd00d> Barret can't jump
[1:34:28] <%Aracon_> oh this is gonna be a struggle
[1:34:29] <%MoonObscure> rip
[1:34:31] <%coreyyotto> YOU FUCKED UP
[1:34:31] <%mechslayer71> @caped_eggy or did you mean gameplay
[1:34:32] <%siamzero94> maybe should have equipped the gun
[1:34:32] <%KawaiiJetty> oh geez
[1:34:34] <%NitronStreams> F
[1:34:34] <%Bane_Kaikyo> Can Barret still shoot with the claw tho?
[1:34:35] <%cvp5127> f
[1:34:35] <%DappercatEsquire> yeah Tifa's proportions are nuts
[1:34:36] <%Alopekis> "Good luck hitting me, bitch"
[1:34:37] <%Keyd00d> NotLikeThis
[1:34:37] <%JoshyJ> LUL
[1:34:38] <%Legato_Ambrose> Big oops
[1:34:39] <%Typhaeon> He'll swoop eventually
[1:34:40] <%Tucker0603> @patstaresat that uppercut reminds me of the Warrior's upheaval ability in FFXIV
[1:34:41] <%heartlesshealer> ENJOY
[1:34:41] <%Sir_stride> f
[1:34:42] <%Dragon_Batman> No magic damage?
[1:34:42] <%siamzero94> FUCK
[1:34:44] <%ScreamLord> Mistakes were made
[1:34:46] <%Metballs> This is why I hate all of his melee options
[1:34:46] <%radiocrawler> psaHoldon
[1:34:52] <%Aracon_> the unfortunate downside to melee barret
[1:34:53] <%BisoromiBear> Goofed
[1:34:55] <%Alopekis> That Lesser Drake is made to fuck with Barret if he uses a melee.
[1:34:55] <%CelioHogane> This is going to take a second
[1:34:57] <%Gigagoat> you can still use ranged abilities
[1:34:57] <%Dragon_Batman> he still has Max fury
[1:35:01] <%Laecerelius> Everyone can jump except Barret!
[1:35:04] <%delilah4you> Use your ATB abiliities
[1:35:06] <%amiroodude> max fury
[1:35:06] <%tweedler92> max overdrive should still work
[1:35:07] <%delilah4you> They still shoot stuff
[1:35:09] <%lord_traxis> Gun abilities still work...for some reason
[1:35:11] <%Explodincatz> shoot abilitys still work
[1:35:12] <%bevyrage> ATB abilities time
[1:35:14] <%DappercatEsquire> @patstaresat run around until you can Maximum Fury
[1:35:15] <%ringabal> HAH
[1:35:17] <%BubbaRands> SHOOT IT
[1:35:18] <%Keyd00d> You can use gun abilities
[1:35:19] <%Legato_Ambrose> But Max Fury requires ATB which builds PAINFULLY slow without being able to hit
[1:35:21] <%CelioHogane> @lord_traxis i will argue that it's for THIS reason XD
[1:35:21] <%valriot> NO SPELLS LUL
[1:35:24] <%mechslayer71> This is why melee is fun but mostly a gimmick/ fuck around playstyle, he’s the only dedicated ranged character most of the game and you’re crippled without him
[1:35:24] <%DukeBlack_> Barret should be able to switch in the next game
[1:35:25] <%Axellogic> Use maximum fury its big range damage
[1:35:25] <%siamzero94> AND NO OFFENSIVE MAGIC PAT?
[1:35:26] <%Nobrev> I hate barrett's melee weapons so much
[1:35:27] <%sirisvirus> focused shot still works
[1:35:31] <%Aracon_> max fury will do the job
[1:35:32] <%thenumber5point5> Item?
[1:35:37] <%NitronStreams> NO GUN BARRET ONLY FINAL FANTASY
[1:35:39] <%Keyd00d> There ya go
[1:35:40] <%Metballs> Items are locked
[1:35:40] <%heartlesshealer> yay
[1:35:47] <%BubbaRands> YAY GUN
[1:35:48] <%Tucker0603> wait....WAT?!?
[1:35:48] <%Firgof> Anger Bullets from his Anger Gun
[1:35:50] <%Zombrocom> That works
[1:35:52] <%Gigagoat> Max fury is so spicy
[1:35:53] <%Alopekis> You'd think if Barret could still use his gun then he would just do it.
[1:35:55] <%Mr_Pylon> Yep, Claw Bullet
[1:35:55] <%bevyrage> you build ATB on block and damage right?
[1:35:59] <%bevyrage> yeah there it is
[1:36:01] <%Aracon_> psaElmo
[1:36:04] <%CelioHogane> GG EASY
[1:36:05] <%Keyd00d> ez
[1:36:10] <%KawaiiJetty> This feels poorly implemented despite melee barret being cool

[1:41:29] <%SH1NK1R0> @optimasmaximas they did but scream lord was saying that he wanted them to move away from unreal for part 2. That would require them to literally recreate the whole game from scratch

[1:49:42] <%Sir_stride> nope
[1:49:45] <%Jaller101514> seems fine
[1:49:46] <%ShichiNoBushi> It's okay to like something as long as you acknowledge that it is bad.
[1:49:47] <%Tucker0603> the combining sword shit is fucking rad
[1:49:49] <%Keyd00d> He saw her

[1:50:01] <%radiocrawler> Advent Children can be enjoyed just the last 25 minutes.
[1:50:02] <%XeroSigmaPrime> Inifinite Jump section against Bahamut was epic as hell
[1:50:02] <%Daniel_Is_I> Pat knows his Poochies

[1:50:58] <%SH1NK1R0> When you get enough sp the weapon level goes up and a new core unlocks on all weapons
[1:50:58] <%reinbachthe3rd> Blade Beam is frickin; awesome.
[1:50:59] <%ShichiNoBushi> Tifa probably picked up a book that gave her SP.
[1:51:01] <%NitronStreams> its almost like ff7 has hood music or somerhing
[1:51:06] <%Keyd00d> Just some tracks near the end I don't liek as much

[1:53:24] <%LandOfTheWay> THEN PERISH
[1:53:27] <%Tucker0603> Goddamn she's ridiculous
[1:53:28] <%televisedrevolting> She is Aqua, huh?
[1:53:28] <%siamzero94> Johnny ain't here so now is falling for this woman
[1:53:31] <%BoomerUnchained> NotLikeThis
[1:53:32] <%NitronStreams> I cant believe they made Worse Yuggie a character
[1:53:33] <%weissguard> @Iwantscandy It's in the whining voice she does.
[1:53:33] <%Legato_Ambrose> This is Nomura going "Really want Yuffie in first game, but..."
[1:53:35] <%ospreyworks> Wow it’s Yuffie
[1:53:37] <%radiocrawler> “Paaaaaat”
[1:53:37] <%Keyd00d> Her voice acting is so different from the main characters
[1:53:42] <%Alopekis> Why don't they just threaten to kill her there if she doesn't give them the key?
[1:53:43] <%ospreyworks> Ugh
[1:53:43] <%NitronStreams> yuffie* godamnit
[1:53:45] <%Aracon_> LOL barret
[1:53:45] <%Firgof> Johnnie and Kyrie gonna hook up for the Annoying Power Couple Combo
[1:53:46] <%Robot_Nixon_> the VA is good, but Kyrie is the WORST
[1:53:46] <%Dementedpenguin> As someone who has two nephews. I'm used to crocodile tears.
[1:53:49] <%Zutrax> @PatStaresAt for this questline you need to progress in the main story or you can't finish it, you'll hit an obvious stopping point to keep side questing before chapter 15 though.
[1:53:49] <%R3Roundabout> Please tell me you get to beat the shit out of this hoe.
[1:53:51] <%Zutrax> @PatStaresAt For a later part of this questline you need to progress in the main story for this chapter, you will hit an obvious stopping point though so you can continue side questing before going to Ch 15
[1:53:51] <%ospreyworks> God I hope Yuffie isn’t this bad
[1:53:52] <%Caped_Eggy> A poor man's yuffie
[1:53:52] <%코코꾸라> Yuffie 0.5
[1:53:53] <%Dragon_Batman> Kinda yea
[1:53:57] <%boki_86> Kyrie is from a FF7 book written by Nojima "Final Fantasy VII The Kids Are Alright: A Turks Side Story" @PatStaresAt
[1:53:58] <%Keyd00d> Yeah but I'd rather have Yuffie
[1:53:59] <%Iwantscandy> @weissguard oh 100%
[1:53:59] <%Aracon_> she's gonna become yuffie I can feel it

[1:54:04] <%R3Roundabout> Fuck this cunt
[1:54:04] <%bevyrage> @PatStaresAt did you get that materia you couldn't get the first time you were in here?
[1:54:04] <%ape_hawk> YUP

[1:54:11] <%cylish> What if its just yuffie in disguise
[1:54:11] <%NovaKnightmare> a PP up
[1:54:11] <%Keyd00d> GOOD SHIT
[1:54:11] <%Typhaeon> Not bad
[1:54:12] <%코코꾸라> YEYEYE
[1:54:12] <%YakumoYomi> As pretty as this game is, there's a stark difference in visual detail between named characters and generic NPCs.
[1:54:12] <%valriot> Yuffie is gonna be such a cunt when she takes all your gear from this game
[1:54:13] <%asgard147> limesPoggers
[1:54:14] <%superstarsage> Oh nice
[1:54:15] <%Engwithan_Elder_God> Sweet
[1:54:15] <%SirGO0SE> pedometer? lol
[1:54:15] <%heartlesshealer> YEYEYE
[1:54:16] <%JohnAtDawn> YEYEYEYEYYE
[1:54:16] <%ringabal> IF HER AP'S ON THE CLOCK
[1:54:16] <%KawaiiJetty> Yuffie will have a giant shuriken to make up for it
[1:54:17] <%bevyrage> 0: !!!
[1:54:17] <%BubbaRands> YEEYYEYEEE
[1:54:17] <%Sir_stride> yup
[1:54:17] <%Tearonex> BAM
[1:54:19] <%JoshyJ> IT MAKE AP GO UP PAT
[1:54:19] <%Keyd00d> ...
[1:54:19] <%tizz86> just now? holy shit
[1:54:19] <%Alopekis> Does it always become AP up? That's what I got too.
[1:54:21] <%Nobrev> I think kyrie is originally from the Turks novel @PatStaresAt
[1:54:23] <%heartlesshealer> Growth Rate GO UP
[1:54:24] <%JohnAtDawn> WHAT DO YOU THINK IT DOES?!
[1:54:25] <%amiroodude> Can no longer measure pedos
[1:54:26] <%TenderBabyBacon> This might actually be Yuffie with a wig and Hat
[1:54:26] <%CelioHogane> Doubles AP, it literally says it.
[1:54:28] <%RAAAAAINMAKER> Doubles AP
[1:54:29] <%valriot> WHAT DOES THAT DO
[1:54:29] <%SilverDevilfish> Time to level revival
[1:54:30] <%Sir_stride> what?
[1:54:32] <%Axellogic> Grind materia
[1:54:34] <%siamzero94> Helps with the
[1:54:36] <%tizz86> @alopekis yes
[1:54:36] <%Keyd00d> Read it?
[1:54:37] <%GohanHitsugaya> It levels up your materia faster
[1:54:37] <%siamzero94> grind
[1:54:37] <%R3Roundabout> I hate when you get shown someone who deserves a good hook to the jaw and expects you to do nothing
[1:54:39] <%Zutrax> You have to link it
[1:54:39] <%Ultimatefool> You just looked at it....
[1:54:40] <%Aracon_> LUL
[1:54:41] <%Sir_stride> Patrick
[1:54:43] <%Tucker0603> I love her style but she's pissing me off
[1:54:43] <%Felto3> it only works for 1 materia so kinda worthless
[1:54:44] <%reinbachthe3rd> LUL
[1:54:44] <%YakumoYomi> @Alopekis I'm guessing so, because that's what I got as well.
[1:54:45] <%Nobrev> You have to link it
[1:54:47] <%valriot> psaLiz psaLiz psaLiz psaLiz psaLiz
[1:54:48] <%Dragon_Batman> 5,000 is easy
[1:54:48] <%CelioHogane> GRIND THAT MATERIA UP
[1:54:54] <%ringabal> Grind with that Pedometer, Pat
[1:54:55] <%croxeye> stick it on your revive materia and don't look back lol
[1:54:55] <%siamzero94> it has to link though
[1:54:55] <%Zutrax> You have to link it to a single materia
[1:54:56] <%Dragon_Batman> Do it anyway
[1:54:57] <%Aracon_> very useful on grinding the revive materia
[1:54:58] <%heartlesshealer> Tifa has a free Link
[1:54:59] <%RAAAAAINMAKER> The grind materia is the colloseum
[1:55:00] <%valriot> ITS ALWAYS USEFUL
[1:55:00] <%Keyd00d> I put it on Revive because that takes forever to level up
[1:55:01] <%Aracon_> shit takes forever otherwise
[1:55:06] <%Dakuu75> I don't get it
[1:55:07] <%Dragon_Batman> Trust me do it now
[1:55:09] <%Legato_Ambrose> Def useful in ng+
[1:55:11] <%boogaleeboo> revive is....probably the worst?
[1:55:14] <%tweedler92> Probably Want in linked to res
[1:55:15] <%heartlesshealer> Tifa's got a free link tho?
[1:55:16] <%KasiCrafter> I feel like using it sooner is better than later.
[1:55:19] <%broth_elemental> please link it to Revive
[1:55:19] <%CelioHogane> @Keyd00d wouldn't be easy to grind revive with tonberry?
[1:55:19] <%Firgof> AP UP is for *Raise*
[1:55:20] <%valriot> Just put it on passive
[1:55:20] <%Cn_alpha_02> Attach to Rez Materia
[1:55:22] <%wsintai> Pat loves hard grinding his Pedo meter @PatStaresAt
[1:55:22] <%Keyd00d> Just play hard mode and you never have to grind
[1:55:24] <%Dragon_Batman> Stick it on revive
[1:55:27] <%bevyrage> revive materia pretty much needs the AP up
[1:55:32] <%GohanHitsugaya> Use it on Prayer
[1:55:35] <%Animorphimagi> ...
[1:55:36] <%lord_traxis> Well, my browser keeps crapping out on me so I guess I'll check the rest out later.
[1:55:38] <%Keyd00d> @CelioHogane You can fight more Tonberries?
[1:55:39] <%Robot_Nixon_> I put that on revival because that shit takes forever
[1:55:40] <%Ultimatefool> Yeah but you get an assload of AP from this chapter on, might as well
[1:55:41] <%boki_86> Kyrie is from a FF7 book written by Nojima "Final Fantasy VII The Kids Are Alright: A Turks Side Story" @PatStaresAt so she is not a FF7R original Charakter
[1:55:44] <%tizz86> if RAISE isn't maxed, link AP UP on it
[1:55:47] <%RAAAAAINMAKER> Attach Revive, Full Revive is God send
[1:55:48] <%valriot> Farm those milkers
[1:55:48] <%Dragon_Batman> Revive if anything
[1:55:51] <%Aracon_> prayer or revive
[1:55:51] <%Keyd00d> USE IT ON RAISE
[1:55:56] <%SH1NK1R0> I’m shocked people had any trouble leveling materia at all. Chapter select triples ap I had all materia maxed by chapter 4 of hard mode
[1:55:57] <%Zutrax> Nah use it on green materia, it's a battle intel for later.
[1:55:58] <%boki_86> on Rais
[1:55:58] <%XeroSigmaPrime> Holy shit I used to wear Kyrie's EXACT outfit (aside from hat) back in High School! I LITERALLY HAVE IT IN MY CLOSET! Cosplay time!
[1:56:00] <%Dakuu75> OH "AP" up, I was hearing "ATB" up. (I jsut woke up. I need a coffee
[1:56:00] <%CelioHogane> @Keyd00d i think you can go to any chapter when you finish the game, not sure on that.
[1:56:02] <%DukeBlack_> Revive for Chadley
[1:56:04] <%Dragon_Batman> That is why
[1:56:06] <%valkuma> i used "Revive" materia for the entire game and it didnt level up b the time i beat the end
[1:56:07] <%broth_elemental> put in on revive for Chadkey
[1:56:09] <%Keyd00d> Oh yeah I guess that's true
[1:56:10] <%Cn_alpha_02> Use on Resurrection
[1:56:10] <%Legato_Ambrose> Oh ye, raise takes A WHILE
[1:56:14] <%cvp5127> prayer then raise
[1:56:17] <%YakumoYomi> @XeroSigmaPrime SHOW PICS
[1:56:20] <%heartlesshealer> Yeah, get poison out of the way sooner
[1:56:21] <%JoshyJ> raise takes forever and is a big need on NG+
[1:56:27] <%boki_86> @XeroSigmaPrime want to see
[1:56:31] <%Keyd00d> Raise is the only magic I haven't maxed yet for Chadley
[1:56:33] <%Aracon_> yeah you need it for post game
[1:56:35] <%Tearonex> I didn't get arise till NG+
[1:56:35] <%Keyd00d> and I'm like halfway through hard mode
[1:56:38] <%croxeye> pro tip for later in the game, have multiple versions of the same magic materia leveled up for later in the game
[1:56:44] <%Dragon_Batman> Check out Whack a box from the kids
[1:56:46] <%boogaleeboo> I mean practically the only thing that it matters for is if he wants to finish all the chadley stuff on stream
[1:56:51] <%ShinyBisharp1> what chapter is he on
[1:56:51] <%boogaleeboo> Which HOLY SHIT don't
[1:56:59] <%tizz86> raise is the last one needed max lvl for chadly
[1:57:00] <%Legato_Ambrose> It is helpful
[1:57:00] <%boogaleeboo> It's just pure grind
[1:57:03] <%Dragon_Batman> Chp 24
[1:57:05] <%coreyyotto> Seems obvious
[1:57:05] <%ringabal> PERFECT
[1:57:06] <%Dragon_Batman> 14*
[1:57:06] <%wsintai> nice
[1:57:10] <%ape_hawk> i love this theme
[1:57:16] <%XeroSigmaPrime> @YakumoYomi OMG I need to hem it a bit since I was a bit chunkier back in HS. OMG THO! IM GONNA DO IT doodSweet doodSweet doodSweet doodSweet doodSweet
[1:57:18] <%heartlesshealer> learned blade beam <3
[1:57:18] <%JoshyJ> blade burst is so fuckin sick
[1:57:18] <%valriot> Nah doesnt matter for first normal run, but on Hard its borderline mandatory
[1:57:18] <%ScottishMadJacko> Locking on helps with aiming those moves
[1:57:21] <%NickNackProductions> NickNackProductions subscribed with Twitch Prime. They've subscribed for 4 months, currently on a 2 month streak! clud swing sword bjg
[1:57:25] <%Firgof> Gotta get that *Arise*
[1:57:26] <%bigboy3d> Where's Cloud going again?
[1:57:29] <%Dragon_Batman> It is still really nice to have
[1:57:30] <%Zutrax> Grinding post game is so piss easy, I got max level in most meterias and characters in like less than an hour.
[1:57:31] <%JohnAtDawn> Blade Burst is actual trash and that upsets me.
[1:57:33] <%Firgof> Arise is pretty nice at least
[1:57:36] <%valriot> 1 ball
[1:57:41] <%Quigsies> God, remember combat in FFXV?
[1:57:43] <%VHGS> Leveling up extra attack magic is whatever, since the rank 1 spells are so good
[1:57:44] <%ape_hawk> IM THRU WITH YOU! *whiffs*
[1:57:45] <%CelioHogane> ONE
[1:57:46] <%YakumoYomi> @XeroSigmaPrime You better. DON'T TEASE ME, WOMAN.
[1:57:47] <%Aracon_> considering arise only costs 14MP it's real nice
[1:57:50] <%Felto3> blade burst is great
[1:57:54] <%croxeye> you don't need to max everything, but having secondaries that are up to level 2 are nice for later is all
[1:57:56] <%Firgof> Blade Burst exists purely for 'oops my weapon has a immune/resist materia on it vs. this enemy'
[1:57:58] <%Keyd00d> I wish they had made XV combat good instead of bad
[1:58:01] <%XeroSigmaPrime> @boki_86 CHYEA, outfit needs to get sewn a little smaller since I was way chunkier then, BUT IT SO CUTE
[1:58:05] <%cvp5127> not triple slash?
[1:58:06] <%mechslayer71> You’re gonna want multiple revivals @patstaresat
[1:58:07] <%tizz86> @johnatdawn the untyped range dmg can be useful at times
[1:58:08] <%Firgof> And/or killing tons of weak minions
[1:58:13] <%imthewisejanitor> I dipped out of the stream for a minute, so my bad if it’s been said already, but any chance hard mode will be streamed too?
[1:58:17] <+wildthing323> wildthing323 subscribed at Tier 1. 
[1:58:19] <%Alopekis> Woolie is streaming
[1:58:20] <%KasiCrafter> It's FINE, chat.
[1:58:21] <%Keyd00d> not for hard mode you don't
[1:58:30] <%Aydarkzero> yeah Phoenix Downs Kappa
[1:58:31] <%flamingmonkies2> @PatStaresAt Planning on finishing the game tonight?
[1:58:33] <%valriot> I still like FFXV, its charming. PC version really fixed it up a lot.
[1:58:34] <%CelioHogane> @mechslayer71 don't backseat, or the mods will kick you!
[1:58:37] <%ape_hawk> god, this game has so many hidden loading screens, its ridiculous
[1:58:38] <%Aracon_> pat will do the necessary prep
[1:58:40] <%XeroSigmaPrime> @YakumoYomi IKR ITS SO CUTE! I cant wait! I really should set up a twitter for cosplay
[1:58:43] <%Firgof> lol no
[1:58:43] <%heartlesshealer> big wrong
[1:58:44] <%supersugoisenpai1> Not a chance
[1:58:44] <%Aracon_> pat is basically batman
[1:58:45] <%Dragon_Batman> Nah he still has a lot
[1:58:46] <%wsintai> PFFFT hell naw
[1:58:47] <%heartlesshealer> finish later
[1:58:47] <%croxeye> oh NOOOOO man lol, he's got a LOT of game left
[1:58:48] <%Keyd00d> He's got like 10 hours left
[1:58:48] <@SoFarFetched> Today is Sidequest Day.
[1:58:49] <%bevyrage> definitely not finishing the game tonight
[1:58:49] <%Aydarkzero> he's got a ways to go until this is done
[1:58:50] <%boogaleeboo> Yeah he's got like.......8 hours of pure story?
[1:58:51] <%valkuma> theres still like 15 hours of game
[1:58:52] <%siamzero94> like two more nights
[1:58:52] <%boogaleeboo> Easy
[1:58:52] <%tizz86> I've got phx dwns, I'll be fine. oh, you sweet summer child
[1:59:00] <%Dakuu75> Fun Fact: The lip syncing in this game was done by an A.I. not animated by ppl.
[1:59:00] <%Zombrocom> There are much hours left
[1:59:01] <%Axellogic> What do you mean Pat already finished the game in his heart
[1:59:02] <%Firgof> well for now he'll be fine
[1:59:03] <%Legato_Ambrose> I thought that too...
[1:59:09] <%Alopekis> It shows
[1:59:10] <%optimasmaximas> woolie streaming CBT PogChamp
[1:59:11] <%Sir_stride> pat at least has too more streams left.
[1:59:13] <%Dragon_Batman> Look anyway
[1:59:15] <%croxeye> I made the mistake of going from ch 15 to finishing in 1 night and it took me a long time
[1:59:17] <%Sir_stride> two*
[1:59:20] <%heartlesshealer> oops
[1:59:22] <%ScottishMadJacko> One side quest is by the orphanage pat
[1:59:26] <%heartlesshealer> take the choco-bus
[1:59:28] <%Dragon_Batman> She has the key
[1:59:30] <%Keyd00d> You have to do her quest
[1:59:31] <%Zombrocom> Nah pat will take 4 more streams at least to finish
[1:59:32] <%Daskolin> WTF i just heard metal gear pieces
[1:59:33] <%ConLin_Arts_> find them
[1:59:34] <%prism_zet> no
[1:59:35] <%heartlesshealer> oh
[1:59:40] <%Legato_Ambrose> eleison
[1:59:42] <%CelioHogane> Coloseum time?
[1:59:43] <%ConLin_Arts_> you just need to find the stashes
[1:59:44] <%XeroSigmaPrime> @Dakuu75 Max said this but he also amended saying that alot of it is AI then edited afterwards by ppl
[1:59:45] <%ringabal> KYRIEEEEEEEE
[1:59:47] <%prism_zet> find the childs
[1:59:48] <%SH1NK1R0> Made burst does non elemental magic damage and it’s element changes with the elemental materia. If you are using blade burst and think “it sucks” that’s because you are probably using a sword with low magic attack. It’s the same for Tifa’s chi trap.
[1:59:50] <%Zutrax> One of the quests you're missing is in the park
[1:59:51] <%JoshyJ> kids r close
[1:59:56] <%Aracon_> you should do the children mission first since you're closest to it @PatStaresAt
[2:00:00] <%prism_zet> graveyard
[2:00:00] <%Ascethetic> @patstaresat theyre at the graveyard
[2:00:02] <%Nope80808> One of them requires some Slight story progression before you can finish itt.
[2:00:03] <%ScottishMadJacko> Yeah
[2:00:06] <%siamzero94> @PatStaresAt Children at the graveyard
[2:00:11] <%solidousstream> can someone make an emote of the koolaid man with Pat's face so we can spam koolaid pat saying Oh yeah!
[2:00:18] <%CelioHogane> no
[2:00:27] <%Aracon_> psaBig murder
[2:00:29] <%XeroSigmaPrime> @solidousstream This, we need this
[2:00:32] <%amiroodude> creepy children and their graveyards
[2:00:33] <%Laecerelius> Big, strong murder time!
[2:00:34] <%Ascethetic> I had to pull up a guide to find them
[2:00:39] <%linSP> Dead kids hehe
[2:00:39] <%Dragon_Batman> Specially for this weapon
[2:00:45] <%Dakuu75> @XeroSigmaPrime ah, well. I guess i'm just a lier. my bad
[2:00:54] <%Zombrocom> Self destruct?
[2:01:02] <%Axellogic> I wasnt paying attention earlier did he equip his new limit breaks
[2:01:07] <%NickNackProductions> this wont take lon- AGGGH
[2:01:11] <%Dragon_Batman> I believe he did
[2:01:26] <%axiomthunder> where we at story wise bois?
[2:01:27] <%siamzero94> @Zombrocom you can steal that form the bombers (that their english name?)
[2:01:28] <%amiroodude> @Axellogic yep
[2:01:40] <%Dragon_Batman> Need help to get topside in chp 14
[2:01:42] <%XeroSigmaPrime> @Dakuu75 No! You didnt lie! You're totally correct about the AI, its just tweaked and refined by ppl to save alot of work and glitches
[2:01:43] <%ringabal> ENDLESS TRASH
[2:01:43] <%Firgof> big story, much wall
[2:01:45] <%JoshyJ> psaBig scrap
[2:01:48] <%ape_hawk> yeah, its almost as bad as your home
[2:01:59] <%MAX116030> @PatStaresAt Hi for spoilercast will you invite Maximilian? He just finished the game
[2:02:03] <%Dragon_Batman> Aaand
[2:02:09] <%Axellogic> ded
[2:02:12] <%CelioHogane> Cloud is broken
[2:02:13] <%Zutrax> Magic is insanely overpowered in this game frankly
[2:02:23] <%Dakuu75> @XeroSigmaPrime oh-ok, I get what yur saying now. gotchya
[2:02:24] <%Firgof> Needs to be for Hard Mode imo
[2:02:24] <%Shadicara> Oh hey it's clumbo
[2:02:25] <%Capta1n_H3nry> Barret's that cool uncle that you never wanna be alone with.
[2:02:27] <%Zutrax> It's why you have barely any methods of recovering MP in Hard Mode

[2:02:42] <%Zombrocom> They dont want to do podcast guests
[2:02:48] <%SGrim> @MAX116030 awesome idea. I doubt they'll do it, unfortunately.

[2:08:51] <%alcors_wisdom> that works out because i was NOT paying attention
[2:08:54] <%ape_hawk> Pat, its okay, you basically figured out how to beat Tonberry
[2:08:55] <%tizz86> So far, I've only used easy to get one trophy
[2:09:00] <%snow_bush> E A S Y M O D E Selected

[2:09:04] <%Zutrax> TIME + MAGNIFY
[2:09:04] <@SSaryn> Ez
[2:09:07] <%Dragon_Batman> Yea
[2:09:08] <%heartlesshealer> yeah
[2:09:08] <%suikudo> How much of it was easy mode?
[2:09:08] <%starlorb3> EASY MODE I SNOW SELECTABLE
[2:09:12] <%mechslayer71> @tizz86 The motorcycle mini game one?
[2:09:14] <%dukenux> he sounds so defeated
[2:09:16] <%KawaiiJetty> at least easy mode does not affect jules big pull up muscles
[2:09:20] <%Metballs> You have to redo the ENTIRE game now, Pat. It's only fair
[2:09:21] <%Shadicara> Pat just go back in time with your time materia Kappa
[2:09:22] <%YakumoYomi> Tonberry isn't even that hard a fight. It's just that Chef's Knife is like the first instance of instant death you encounter in the game.
[2:09:22] <%tizz86> @mechslayer71 yep
[2:09:23] <%RAAAAAINMAKER> Listen if he plays on Hard it's fine
[2:09:23] <%spiritofmojave> it sucks there's only one all materia in the game
[2:09:23] <%Aracon_> fyi chat, when tonberry does the move chef's knife it is unblockable. But clearly on easy mode it is :)
[2:09:25] <%prism_zet> haste self, then haste others, it's fine, takes like ten seconds
[2:09:27] <%Dragon_Batman> I mean eventually magnify will be better
[2:09:31] <%CelioHogane> Is there no place that sells blue materia in this game?
[2:09:34] <%suikudo> @PatStaresAt No really how much of this was easy mode?
[2:09:37] <%Zutrax> If you want magnify for healing, just use prayer
[2:09:37] <%snow_bush> Only barrier I see is between you and higher difficulties
[2:09:38] <%heartlesshealer> not so far
[2:09:39] <%alcors_wisdom> yeah but what are you using mag for now
[2:09:40] <%CelioHogane> Because one elemental materia seems so little.
[2:09:47] <%sniffy77> Play on hard to cancel the baby
[2:09:48] <%SirGO0SE> just start from the beginning
[2:09:48] <%ringabal> Cloud for sure
[2:09:52] <%GohanHitsugaya> Tifa
[2:09:52] <%heartlesshealer> no idea
[2:09:53] <%Aracon_> I use haste on barret personally
[2:09:58] <%Shadicara> Put it on someone else to buff you
[2:09:58] <%Legato_Ambrose> One elemental, ONE Magnify like COME ON
[2:09:59] <%Zutrax> Barret + Haste = best tank
[2:09:59] <%JoshyJ> first strike + haste Kreygasm
[2:10:02] <%heartlesshealer> I guess Cloud? You never use his MP
[2:10:02] <%mechslayer71> Easy mode is why you were able to block the instakill @patstaresat
[2:10:06] <%PsideFxX> baret
[2:10:10] <%spiritofmojave> Cloud's your best magic user 9/10 less Aerith is around
[2:10:13] <%vaporousTippler> Wait this means Pat died on easy.
[2:10:21] <%Metballs> You do get a second elemental, but it's way at the ass end of the game
[2:10:22] <%spiritofmojave> *times
[2:10:22] <%Legato_Ambrose> It does.
[2:10:26] <%ahdurian> level up Barrier then switch it for Time after
[2:10:29] <%boogaleeboo> I mean he can always change it if he has to
[2:10:32] <%YakumoYomi> @CelioHogane I don't think you can buy them, but I got another Elemental shortly after where Pat is in the game
[2:10:34] <%Dragon_Batman> @mechslayer71 Really? that's interesting
[2:10:35] <%ringabal> PAT DIED TO AN EASY MODE TONBERRY
[2:10:36] <%Shadicara> Died on easy LUL
[2:10:59] <%Axellogic> Now people are just getting mean :V
[2:11:02] <%Firgof> Still have my respect for clearing Tifa's Final Pullup Minigame @PatStaresAt
[2:11:03] <%spiritofmojave> Died to Tonwheel LUL
[2:11:06] <%heartlesshealer> tonberries are tonberries, guys
[2:11:09] <%Dragon_Batman> Before that tho check on whack a box
[2:11:13] <%Firgof> Easy Mode don't do nothin' for that
[2:11:14] <%Legato_Ambrose> Yeah I forgot about the second Elemental, but the no second Magnify really annoyed me
[2:11:16] <%CelioHogane> @YakumoYomi do you keep materia in New Game +? So you can grind them by new game ++++?
[2:11:18] <%Aracon_> may as well do all the Colosseum stuff now then
[2:11:24] <%Zutrax> Barrier + Haste + Steelskin + Lifesaver + Chakra + HP UP = Big Barret tank
[2:11:28] <%boogaleeboo> New Game + keeps everything
[2:11:30] <%Legato_Ambrose> LATER
[2:11:31] <%Firgof> later
[2:11:31] <%siamzero94> YES
[2:11:32] <%Metballs> Not yet, Pat
[2:11:32] <%Aracon_> yeah there's 2 elemental materias
[2:11:33] <%ape_hawk> at the end of the game
[2:11:34] <%RetroCop87> quest item at the angel's hideout
[2:11:34] <%Zombrocom> Later
[2:11:36] <%spiritofmojave> way later pretty sure
[2:11:36] <%tizz86> not yet
[2:11:37] <%heartlesshealer> later
[2:11:42] <%Ascethetic> @patstaresat there is a sidequest in sector 5 that can be missed. hes near the school
[2:11:43] <%Legato_Ambrose> It feels REQUIRED
[2:11:44] <%optimasmaximas> Yeah
[2:11:45] <%radiocrawler> Eventually
[2:11:47] <%Dragon_Batman> Elemental really needs to be at max
[2:11:49] <%Aracon_> definitely
[2:11:51] <%Ascethetic> its the doctor
[2:11:54] <%ScottishMadJacko> Its so powerful though
[2:12:01] <%Shadicara> It's meant for all that time you wait for the next part of the game Kappa
[2:12:03] <%Sir_stride> but it is pretty good when used
[2:12:04] <%coreyyotto> Is it a spoiler to tell Pat how to get the second elemental?
[2:12:07] <%Dragon_Batman> The doctor?
[2:12:08] <%siamzero94> the doctor
[2:12:09] <%MalekDracarus> near
[2:12:10] <%Firgof> on street by school
[2:12:11] <%Ascethetic> down the road
[2:12:12] <%Legato_Ambrose> DOKTOR
[2:12:17] <%Aracon_> you can become immune to elemental attacks which trivializes certain fights in post game
[2:12:17] <%DukeBlack_> he already got it
[2:12:18] <%RAAAAAINMAKER> Elemental armor is where its at
[2:12:19] <%Felto3> he'll get the materia anyway so why bother
[2:12:19] <%Shadicara> DOKTOR!
[2:12:20] <%Sir_stride> yes @coreyyotto
[2:12:24] <%weissguard> Right down the road.
[2:12:24] <%spiritofmojave> OH YEAH this one is sorta fun
[2:12:30] <%spiritofmojave> for reasons

[2:12:34] <%Laecerelius> Aerith had ALL the best herbs!
[2:12:35] <%CelioHogane> Yeah... "treating people"
[2:12:37] <%Movemeister> THAT DANK KUSH
[2:12:39] <%RAAAAAINMAKER> Doctor John Oliver

[2:12:45] <%reinbachthe3rd> "She always knew how to get the dankest herb. That sticky kush-kush."
[2:12:46] <%Firgof> 'here take this'
[2:12:47] <%Dragon_Batman> That list tho
[2:12:47] <%prism_zet> the last one is goofy, need to do other side quest to get it
[2:12:49] <%Mornaka> You need something extra
[2:12:52] <%Zutrax> The other side quest you're missing is at the park fyi, which coincidentally has something you need for this sidequest
[2:12:52] <%starlorb3> he looks like john oliver

[2:13:30] <%prism_zet> key item read
[2:13:33] <%Treuan> Behe-Moth can only be defeated by Giga-Lamp

[2:13:50] <%j0ustar> Goin' back to Gacktland
[2:13:50] <%ringabal> CLOUD, GET MY BIG GUN! NO THE psaBig GUN!
[2:13:50] <%spiritofmojave> Behemoth from the MHW series Kappa
[2:13:54] <%Dakuu75> behemoth is in this game? nice.
[2:13:54] <%siamzero94> But it's only the smaller version of it
[2:13:55] <%Legato_Ambrose> Tonberry just doinks Behemoth
[2:13:57] <%broth_elemental> behemoth is a good staple
[2:14:04] <%radiocrawler> ENB beating Behemoth no heals was a pretty dope fight.
[2:14:04] <%ScottishMadJacko> Wymer time
[2:14:04] <%bevyrage> Behemoth is in EVERY FF game
[2:14:07] <%Dragon_Batman> They nailed that design
[2:14:08] <%asgard147> SourPls
[2:14:09] <%Shady_Squid> Chat, who's your favorite FF monster?
[2:14:12] <%CelioHogane> I would be more hyped if @StridentSong didn't spoil me that existed last time :(
[2:14:15] <%Bane_Kaikyo> be sure to bring flash pods and flashbugs for behemoth fight...
[2:14:16] <%coreyyotto> Okay but where was Aerith getting behemoth horns from before all this
[2:14:18] <%Keyd00d> That's a hard question
[2:14:19] <%reinbachthe3rd> @radiocrawler ENB is a mad lad.
[2:14:20] <%Metballs> Tonberries for me
[2:14:22] <%Shadicara> Hell House LUL
[2:14:24] <%Sir_stride> GUIDE MEEEE
[2:14:24] <%Legato_Ambrose> Moogle
[2:14:25] <%shurtal> whatsup
[2:14:27] <%RetroCop87> Who would win, an extremely ornery end-game behemoth, or a tonberry on easy mode?
[2:14:27] <%Alopekis> @bevyrage What about Final Fantasy Dissidia?
[2:14:31] <%Firgof> With how good this soundtrack is, I'm *really* looking forward to Cosmo Canyon
[2:14:32] <%Dragon_Batman> Bomb or Behemoth
[2:14:33] <%Zombrocom> Wait this normal doctor mans normal medicine needs BEHEMOTH HORNS? And his regular supplier is AERITH?
[2:14:34] <%DukeBlack_> did he ever beat Levi/
[2:14:36] <%JoshyJ> yoink my hp now
[2:14:39] <%radiocrawler> @reinbachthe3rd he sure is.
[2:14:41] <%Felto3> i wish chadley had ignis's voice
[2:14:41] <%spiritofmojave> Mine's the chandelier that looks like Dio or Tonberry
[2:14:41] <%ringabal> @bevyrage Today I learned Mario Sports Mix is a Final Fantasy game
[2:14:45] <%rytyoung> I HOPE
[2:14:47] <@StridentSong> @CelioHogane Let it go. I timed you out because you decided to make an exact dead on prediction. If you did the same thing about the final boss I'd have banned you
[2:14:52] <%reinbachthe3rd> @DukeBlack_ Nope
[2:14:56] <%CelioHogane> @StridentSong i was jesting you
[2:14:58] <%Aracon_> 6 levels total
[2:15:00] <%Keyd00d> Yes
[2:15:01] <%bevyrage> @ringabal yeah dude, it's a trip ain't it?
[2:15:02] <%rytyoung> Yeyeyeyeye
[2:15:05] <%ape_hawk> yup, but they are further in the story
[2:15:06] <%CelioHogane> I don't care
[2:15:09] <%Sir_stride> yes
[2:15:11] <%mechslayer71> That ball exposure was complete and utter LUL
[2:15:12] <%Felto3> 6 is postgame
[2:15:12] <%YakumoYomi> Aerith is either getting those horns from a badass, or she's a super badass herself.
[2:15:12] <%rytyoung> Much further in the story
[2:15:14] <%Keyd00d> I didn't unlock 6 until NG+
[2:15:16] <%Zutrax> 6 is hard mode only
[2:15:16] <%Aracon_> you don't get the last level up till post game
[2:15:17] <%tizz86> anyone else think of Ignis when Chadly "developed a new materia"?
[2:15:17] <%boogaleeboo> Nah
[2:15:19] <%Mr_Pylon> 6 takes SOOO long to get
[2:15:25] <%rytyoung> Aww man this soooooong
[2:15:25] <%coreyyotto> You basically can't get level 6 until you start hard mode
[2:15:27] <%CelioHogane> also to be fair @StridentSong that totally sounded like a Behemoth roar.
[2:15:33] <%Daskolin> 6 diferent BAHAMUTS!
[2:15:35] <%Ascethetic> @patstaresat if you wanna finish the side quests. you have to continue the story a little more
[2:15:37] <%linSP> ok chadley
[2:15:38] <%Zutrax> Don't bother waiting since 6 is only hard mode.
[2:15:39] <%mechslayer71> They’re all in the final area @patstaresat
[2:15:41] <%Dragon_Batman> Yea boyo
[2:15:46] <%Dakuu75> @tizz86 totaly "I've developed a new reci-peh~"
[2:15:51] <@StridentSong> Sure bringing it up a lot for not caring
[2:15:53] <%ButtMcChuggles> 6th isn't hard mode, unless there's 7
[2:15:59] <%prism_zet> @tizz86 I said "I developed a new reh ceh peh" every time chadley said it in my game
[2:16:07] <%gatoralus> man this game is so good
[2:16:11] <%RetroCop87> level 5 Buster Sword >>> sex
[2:16:13] <%SH1NK1R0> What weapon level 6? You get to that by hitting level cap and getting like one book in hard mode per character
[2:16:18] <%Shadicara> Can't wait to play this on a pc release look at iiiit
[2:16:19] <%tizz86> @prism_zet i chuckled nearly every time
[2:16:24] <%CelioHogane> @StridentSong Seesh, i just was trying to make fun of you, stop making it less funnier!
[2:16:25] <%GohanHitsugaya> Hm, needs more materia...
[2:16:28] <%Aracon_> post game
[2:16:30] <%Zutrax> Until hard mode
[2:16:34] <%Aracon_> it takes fucking forever
[2:16:34] <%moogleboy1984> true
[2:16:36] <%shurtal> yup
[2:16:37] <%mechslayer71> @sh1nk1r0 Yeah, it’s 250 SP, level 50 isn’t enough on its own
[2:16:38] <%Firgof> you *can* but nah
[2:16:41] <%Zutrax> You need an item you get for beating hard mode bosses
[2:16:43] <%siamzero94> Or you can grind
[2:16:43] <%Keyd00d> Unless you grind hard maybe
[2:16:47] <%CelioHogane> You can... WITH GRINDING
[2:16:48] <%moogleboy1984> you need at least one post game Manuscript
[2:16:52] <%Keyd00d> Oh nvm
[2:16:57] <%mechslayer71> You need the manuscripts
[2:16:57] <%ratreborn> so i did some grinding off screen
[2:17:04] <%Aracon_> metal knuckles
[2:17:07] <%ahdurian> Metal Knuckles
[2:17:07] <%RetroCop87> Metal Knuckles
[2:17:08] <%ape_hawk> breast reduction
[2:17:08] <%tizz86> time to MIHN-max
[2:17:08] <%valkuma> feathered gloves or mythril claws
[2:17:09] <%Dragon_Batman> Depends speed is really good
[2:17:09] <%Zutrax> I used Feathered Gloves
[2:17:10] <%gatoralus> metal knuckles FUCK
[2:17:11] <%prism_zet> ew
[2:17:12] <%CelioHogane> @moogleboy1984 wait, there is post game?
[2:17:12] <%Keyd00d> Knucks are good
[2:17:14] <%heartlesshealer> sure
[2:17:14] <%Shadicara> RETURN OF KNUCKLES
[2:17:16] <%ape_hawk> AHAHAHAHA
[2:17:17] <%Dragon_Batman> Feathered is also good
[2:17:18] <%Keyd00d> WTF
[2:17:18] <%supersugoisenpai1> Speed on feathered gloves is amazing
[2:17:19] <%Dakuu75> lol
[2:17:19] <%Aydarkzero> Feathered personally, depends if you want buffs and junk
[2:17:20] <%asgard147> limesD
[2:17:20] <%Treuan> Unlike Metal Sonic they don't chuckle
[2:17:21] <%ratreborn> LOL
[2:17:21] <%Engwithan_Elder_God> BAN HIM
[2:17:21] <%Shadicara> SINNER
[2:17:22] <%ScottishMadJacko> Sonic or feathered seem the best well rounded iirc
[2:17:22] <%Laecerelius> HERESY!
[2:17:22] <%cvp5127> blasphemy
[2:17:23] <%valriot> Sonic is best for now i think
[2:17:23] <%Aracon_> D:
[2:17:23] <%Legato_Ambrose> psaBig psaWrong
[2:17:23] <%Firgof> lol
[2:17:26] <%mechslayer71> Metal knuckles FUCK HARD
[2:17:26] <%valkuma> MOD HIM
[2:17:26] <%spiritofmojave> STOP IT THEY'RE AMAZING
[2:17:27] <%velemi> HERETIC
[2:17:27] <%Caped_Eggy> BAN
[2:17:28] <%Verd_254> HERETIC
[2:17:29] <%siamzero94> SHOOT HIM
[2:17:29] <%BallerSwagBro9k> HERETIC
[2:17:30] <%baronblank> metal knuckles are good until late hard mode, where the original weapons are almost universally best
[2:17:30] <%Laecerelius> BROTHERS, BRING THE HEAVY FLAMER!
[2:17:31] <%SH1NK1R0> Her best weapon is later any way
[2:17:31] <%ahdurian> pump up that attack
[2:17:32] <%cvp5127> BAN
[2:17:33] <%radiocrawler> enbT
[2:17:34] <%Aracon_> SHOOT THAT GUY
[2:17:34] <%spiritofmojave> BAN THAR PERSON
[2:17:35] <%coreyyotto> Metal Knuckles for strength go up but Sonic Striker give you six slots super early
[2:17:36] <%shurtal> I used feathered gloves for most of the game after i got them
[2:17:36] <%j0ustar> B A N
[2:17:37] <%CelioHogane> FLAT IS JUSTICE
[2:17:37] <%RetroCop87> jack up those attack+'s
[2:17:37] <%MalekDracarus> Yeyeyeye
[2:17:39] <%Scarnehu> 2 new materia slots? thats bandanas
[2:17:39] <%Legato_Ambrose> Breast ENHANCEMENT maybe
[2:17:40] <%Keyd00d> psaFist
[2:17:41] <%de1ete_forever> flatten that mans dick!
[2:17:42] <%croxeye> Unlike Sonic we don't chuckle :V
[2:17:42] <%Zutrax> Betal Knuckles are psaBig Number, but they lack some beneficial side effects.
[2:17:44] <%TimetodiveLTX> heretic! heretic!
[2:17:47] <%Caped_Eggy> WATER BOARD HIM
[2:17:48] <%boogaleeboo> I will speak truth to power and say "Depends on what you want to do with her"
[2:17:50] <%Shadicara> If you noticed enough to comment, they're good enough Kappa
[2:17:55] <%Aracon_> hggGun psaSmug
[2:17:57] <%ape_hawk> those tiffers are holding her back, while BREAKING her back!
[2:18:01] <%YakumoYomi> Metal Knuckles for high attack, or Sonic (I think Sonic gets the most materia slots)
[2:18:08] <%cvp5127> give her more muscle
[2:18:12] <%Keyd00d> Materios
[2:18:12] <%Alopekis> materio
[2:18:12] <%prism_zet> Sonic is better for sure
[2:18:14] <%Shadicara> M O R E P O W E R
[2:18:15] <%CelioHogane> Imagine how OP would be tifa without boobs
[2:18:15] <%Laecerelius> Materia for days!
[2:18:16] <%heartlesshealer> oh fuck
[2:18:17] <%Aracon_> materio
[2:18:18] <%NitronStreams> MORE SLOTS
[2:18:21] <%Alopekis> Make sure you eat your materios
[2:18:22] <%Legato_Ambrose> More muscle to carry those big titters
[2:18:23] <%Dragon_Batman> Sonic at least gets the most links
[2:18:26] <%broth_elemental> I always upgraded materia first, skipping the last connection, then the weapons main Stat, then whatever else
[2:18:31] <%ahdurian> god i hate how Pat organizes Materia
[2:18:33] <%SABiscotti> It's-a-me, Materio!
[2:18:33] <%SH1NK1R0> At level 6 all weapons end up with the same slot
[2:18:34] <%TimetodiveLTX> the boobs add weight to every punsh
[2:18:38] <%bevyrage> yeah sonic is better for the link materia count
[2:18:43] <%Ultimatefool> No way these stats transfer to Remake 2, if we're already getting 6 materia weapons
[2:18:50] <%CelioHogane> @ahdurian why? It makes sense, it's from warm to cold.
[2:18:51] <%prism_zet> @broth_elemental this is the most efficient way for sure
[2:18:54] <%Mornaka> They act as ballasts to keep her balance!
[2:18:59] <%Firgof> I'm betting 1000 Gil on Game 2 having 'Materia you can only obtain from fusing max rank Tier 1 Materia'
[2:19:00] <%heartlesshealer> What's Skill Master?
[2:19:05] <%Shadicara> Equipped with ballistics
[2:19:06] <%radiocrawler> I really really love this chill song.
[2:19:10] <%Scarnehu> the claws get 6, i think
[2:19:13] <%CelioHogane> Purple>Yellow>Green>Blue, it's the perfect way to organize materia.
[2:19:14] <%boogaleeboo> Having 10 materia can lead to....interesting builds
[2:19:14] <%ahdurian> @CelioHogane i mean doing it per person separately instead of viewing all
[2:19:20] <%Dragon_Batman> They did good
[2:19:21] <%tizz86> @heartlesshealer pretty useless
[2:19:30] <%Alopekis> 87 materia slots
[2:19:32] <%gatoralus> agreed square did big good on the ost
[2:19:33] <%Dakuu75> is there a canonical reason why they don't make weapons with like... 20 materia slots?
[2:19:33] <%CelioHogane> @ahdurian DUDE, DO YOU THINK PAT EVEN REMEMBERS R1 EXISTS?
[2:19:36] <%Zutrax> By weapon level 6 all weapons have the same amount of materia slots
[2:19:38] <%ape_hawk> 777 materia slots
[2:19:40] <%Aracon_> tifa carried me super hard through end game into post game
[2:19:40] <%ChaosAethr> What Hollow?
[2:19:43] <%KasiCrafter> Wait. How can Tifa parray without a sword? Does she just use her arms? Like always?
[2:19:44] <%heartlesshealer> @tizz86 so it's either niche or trash, dang
[2:19:45] <%TheMattman1313> Feels like something that would play while on the road in Witcher 3
[2:19:47] <%boogaleeboo> You need room for, you know, actual weapons
[2:19:51] <%rytyoung> Doom Eternal's soundtrack drops tomorrow btw, this is a public announcement from Mick G
[2:19:53] <%Firgof> @Dakuu75 Supposedly it just gets harder to do without them nulling each other the more you put in
[2:19:57] <%ahdurian> @CelioHogane obv he does if he guards in battle
[2:20:00] <%DukeBlack_> noctis?
[2:20:02] <%heartlesshealer> concentration activations
[2:20:04] <%Aracon_> attack up and speed up for sure
[2:20:05] <%CelioHogane> You know what i mean
[2:20:06] <%tizz86> @heartlesshealer my bad, i read that as item master
[2:20:10] <%Aracon_> anything related to attacks
[2:20:15] <%Zutrax> Metal Knuckles is more about big damage, the other weapons have neater buffs and stuff.
[2:20:19] <%heartlesshealer> @tizz86 Oh
[2:20:22] <%Dakuu75> @Firgof hmm, neat.
[2:20:30] <%bevyrage> on metal knuckles yeah
[2:20:33] <%baronblank> yea, for metal knucles
[2:20:34] <%Dragon_Batman> I think so yea for each weapon some have different percents
[2:20:36] <%Zutrax> Yeah, one of her other weapons has 70%
[2:20:41] <%bevyrage> sonic and feathers should have multiple concentration activation buffs each
[2:20:46] <%coreyyotto> Add up the Attack ups though.
[2:20:47] <%Solid_Stro> Buffs and Debuffs are more necessary in Hard Mode than in Normal
[2:20:47] <%prism_zet> listen to zutrax lol
[2:20:51] <%Dragon_Batman> Like feathered has 70%
[2:20:52] <%RetroCop87> eh
[2:20:53] <%baronblank> you only really get some abilities when you start running out of moves to get
[2:20:55] <%heartlesshealer> eh
[2:20:55] <%Koush> Pass
[2:20:55] <%Firgof> it's *OK*
[2:20:55] <%siamzero94> meh
[2:20:56] <%ScottishMadJacko> Better invested elsewhere i think
[2:20:57] <%spiritofmojave> it's eh
[2:20:57] <%Keyd00d> psaUp
[2:20:57] <%mechslayer71> The others are way higher on other weapons
[2:20:57] <%gatoralus> its okay
[2:20:57] <%Aracon_> you don't need it
[2:20:57] <%heartlesshealer> only on defeat
[2:20:58] <%superstarsage> You have items?
[2:20:58] <%VHGS> It's fine? Probably wouldn't get it now.
[2:20:58] <%JoshyJ> i wish tifa would suck my blood
[2:21:00] <%Dragon_Batman> usefull but eh
[2:21:02] <%ape_hawk> meh
[2:21:03] <%baronblank> I never really noticed bloodsucker tbh
[2:21:04] <%CelioHogane> Why chose when you can just max out everthing psaSmug
[2:21:05] <%Shadicara> Is the activation lower to offset the damage?
[2:21:07] <%Verd_254> useless in bosses so meh
[2:21:07] <%Axellogic> Its only useful with bunch of mooks
[2:21:08] <%rytyoung> It's not that effective tbh
[2:21:09] <%ahdurian> better use getting attack rather than that
[2:21:11] <%tizz86> @heartlesshealer skill master req atb to be used in a way to benefit from it
[2:21:11] <%mechslayer71> It’s decent
[2:21:13] <%siamzero94> a full heal would be ace
[2:21:15] <%Ultimatefool> Useless in some bosses
[2:21:16] <%RetroCop87> lowest atk+'s are most efficient
[2:21:16] <%spiritofmojave> I've rarely seen it come in handy
[2:21:18] <%Solid_Stro> Useful in hard mode LUL
[2:21:18] <%Metballs> Just pump attack for big number
[2:21:23] <%unstablebeast19> hey pat, did you ever play crisis core? and wether you did or not how do you feel about zack?
[2:21:25] <%Aracon_> attack ups all the way
[2:21:25] <%SH1NK1R0> In normal metal knuckles is great to delete stuff. In hard mode her last weapon is just better because of all the passives
[2:21:27] <%rytyoung> @solid_stro that I can agree on!
[2:21:36] <%valkuma> Consistency is all that matters
[2:21:38] <%Shadicara> It's how knuckles would want it
[2:21:38] <%bevyrage> all of the attack power bonuses adds up to +54 on metal knuckle iirc
[2:21:41] <%heartlesshealer> @tizz86 Thanks for letting me know. Sounds like something to be planned around
[2:21:42] <%Metballs> Materia > Attack > utility was my order
[2:21:44] <%broth_elemental> Pat if you kill things faster you take t
[2:21:57] <%broth_elemental> less damage, so high attack is like healing
[2:22:05] <%Dragon_Batman> It would depend on utility for me
[2:22:17] <%siamzero94> MORE POWER
[2:22:18] <%KasiCrafter> Perfec.
[2:22:18] <%Aracon_> Mmmm look at that attack power
[2:22:19] <%Shadicara> No speed more power
[2:22:24] <%rytyoung> PUNCH GIRL
[2:22:26] <%Shadicara> Big punch
[2:22:38] <%tizz86> @heartlesshealer no prob, I'm around 84hrs total playtime and really haven't used it
[2:22:38] <%akaAxi0m> punch go up
[2:22:39] <%PhysicsLB> in a PINCH oh how droll pat
[2:22:42] <%Solid_Stro> Number go up
[2:22:45] <%bevyrage> yeah do it
[2:22:47] <%coreyyotto> So notice that the Metal Knuckles have the single highest attack stat out of every weapon you have
[2:22:48] <%bevyrage> link that slot
[2:22:49] <%Shadicara> LUL
[2:22:50] <%rytyoung> fuck punch is a weird looking word
[2:22:51] <%boogaleeboo> Like as a boring answer everyone should probably have an elemental, a heal, and a buff/debuff
[2:23:10] <%Firgof> yep
[2:23:11] <%RetroCop87> CHOCOBO RIDE
[2:23:11] <%Dragon_Batman> The playground at least
[2:23:12] <%boogaleeboo> chocobo it
[2:23:12] <%Firgof> get your 'bos on
[2:23:15] <%Taglog7> Stampy Kappa

[2:23:22] <%siamzero94> SMALL SHORTCUT ON THE WAY
[2:23:25] <%prism_zet> chocobo
[2:23:33] <%mechslayer71> Chocobo @patstaresat

[2:23:42] <%SolidusRex> SO YOU THINK YOU CAN RIDE THIS CHOCOBO?
[2:23:45] <%RetroCop87> oh jesus
[2:23:45] <%Solid_Stro> @boogaleeboo Buffs and debuffs are more essential in hard mode rather than normal. You can get by
[2:23:49] <%radiocrawler> Not for me @futurecity10
[2:23:53] <%Dragon_Batman> @Futurecity10 It did for me a while ago
[2:23:55] <%Aracon_> blade beam is proably really good for whackabox

[2:25:48] <%prism_zet> punsieher mode
[2:25:48] <%Big_Dream> Hard edge
[2:25:49] <%Axellogic> Its cool cause it peirces but its too hard to aim
[2:25:49] <%Aracon_> LUL LUL
[2:25:50] <%Engwithan_Elder_God> Please clap
[2:25:52] <%Sir_stride> wiff
[2:25:53] <%coreyyotto> EMBARASSING
[2:25:53] <%bevyrage> focus on building time and progressing through the arena
[2:25:53] <%ahdurian> using this without Hard Edge LOL
[2:25:54] <%Keyd00d> Why did you give up on big box
[2:25:55] <%toastybites> those kids are mocking you as we speak
[2:25:57] <%Taglog7> Box the true antagonist of ff7
[2:26:00] <%Solid_Stro> Skillz
[2:26:01] <%Laecerelius> Pat defeated by the allure of BIG NUMBER
[2:26:01] <%boogaleeboo> UNPLUG YOUR ETHERNET QUICK
[2:26:03] <%Aracon_> hoo boy
[2:26:10] <%j0ustar> PatWhiffsAt
[2:26:17] <%heartlesshealer> yeah
[2:26:17] <%TalekAetem> @boogaleeboo This ain't Crota!
[2:26:18] <%tizz86> hardedge with max atk really helps break shit
[2:26:22] <%rytyoung> Huuuuh this is waaay easier with a decent weapon LUL
[2:26:23] <%prism_zet> that doesn't matter for this
[2:26:25] <%Aracon_> infinity's end is def a better idea here
[2:26:25] <%Legato_Ambrose> I don't know if phys attack matters on the boxes
[2:26:26] <%ratreborn> i think its based on hits
[2:26:27] <%suikudo> Does he see how little time he has?
[2:26:28] <%mechslayer71> Physical damage matters for breaking the boxes quickly. As such, hard edge is the best option @patstaresat
[2:26:28] <%Keyd00d> Oh attack matters
[2:26:30] <%SH1NK1R0> With deadly dodge this mini game is a joke
[2:26:30] <%siamzero94> Yes that's why Pat...
[2:26:32] <%Firgof> Imagine kids flexing *harder than this*
[2:26:32] <%Metballs> At least you got the elixer
[2:26:37] <%Animorphimagi> I did it all first try
[2:26:37] <%Aracon_> blow up the 1500s with one infinity's end
[2:26:39] <%prism_zet> phys atk doesn't matter for boxes
[2:26:39] <%reinbachthe3rd> Got em'
[2:26:43] <%Zutrax> Deadly Dodge + Hardedge and going for only the time blocks
[2:26:45] <%broth_elemental> go the other way, too
[2:26:48] <%startstoprepeat> deadly dodge plus triple strike for the 1500 does wonders
[2:26:48] <%DukeBlack_> I did it with Buster.
[2:26:49] <%Aracon_> LOL
[2:26:49] <%Shadicara> LUL
[2:26:49] <%Dragon_Batman> Infinities end is good
[2:26:49] <%YakumoYomi> Go for red boxes first
[2:26:50] <%Axellogic> I had to use infinity edge on hardedge to kill the big boxes
[2:26:52] <%Daniel_Is_I> BEGONE CHILD
[2:26:53] <%Laecerelius> Troll child!
[2:26:53] <%Felto3> hardedge also lets you one shot the 1500 boxes with infinity's end
[2:26:54] <%coreyyotto> Iron Blade is actually better so you get to use Triple Slash
[2:26:56] <%Mornaka> Infintite end breaks the 1500s in one
[2:26:56] <%Zebroneath> What a gremlin\
[2:26:57] <%Movemeister> OOF
[2:26:57] <%Taglog7> don't tell me you'z a bitch

[2:29:02] <%Firgof> It's time to Disinfect the Woolie Hole
[2:29:04] <%RetroCop87> Wedge's fat body opened a whole to it when he was driven into the dirt
[2:29:08] <%Ultimatefool> Wait it's a different lab??
[2:29:10] <%suikudo> Gas him up with the greens and let em go! stand back stand clear as he puts on a show!

[2:29:18] <%TheMattman1313> This guy says "monsters" like an EDF soldier
[2:29:21] <%Solid_Stro> People lose their homes and livelihoods and suddenly become so needy DansGame
[2:29:24] <%Guardiansaiyan> @RetroCop87 at least he was good for something!
[2:29:26] <%dukenux> Wait, there are two secret underground labs in this game?
[2:29:26] <%Legato_Ambrose> awh shit here we go

[2:29:46] <%Dragon_Batman> yea
[2:29:49] <%YakumoYomi> Japan: "LOL fat guy"
[2:29:50] <%dukenux> If Wedge wasn't so fat
[2:29:53] <%rytyoung> LUL
[2:29:54] <%Solid_Stro> Caught between a Wedge and a hard place
[2:29:55] <%Aracon_> LUL
[2:29:56] <%Pyroclase> I can't type any day!
[2:29:57] <%Keyd00d> tada

[2:30:01] <%Verd_254> I know that feel
[2:30:03] <%Firgof> #ballsforever-recorded-on-vod
[2:30:04] <%Aydarkzero> lmao
[2:30:07] <%rytyoung> I feel your pain I make typos allll the time
[2:30:09] <%RetroCop87> the mass of wedge couldn't be predicted by Shinra's structural scientists
[2:30:09] <%Dragon_Batman> That's my secret cap, I can't type always
[2:30:14] <%optimasmaximas> LUL LUL LUL
[2:30:15] <%cowardman93> yeah but if Wedge died at the pillar none of those people would be alive in the first place
[2:30:16] <%coffeeabomination> Free escape ropes
[2:30:17] <%BonewheelVanguard> No engrish good
[2:30:18] <%JoshyJ> because fuck a ladder
[2:30:19] <%Keyd00d> Some as in this one
[2:30:19] <%Daniel_Is_I> Ah, the escape rope button
[2:30:24] <%JohnAtDawn> By "some" they mean just this one
[2:30:24] <%RPG_CHICAGO> watched Max beat it last night, can't wait to get Pat's reaction...
[2:30:28] <%PocketChange117> this is some bumping music
[2:30:31] <%solidousstream> tomatoes are the juiciest of fruits
[2:30:38] <%Shadicara> Pussy out button Kappa
[2:30:39] <%Firgof> Because it takes like 5 minutes to get back up yeah
[2:30:40] <%wsintai> Deep...under GROUND...
[2:30:42] <%realm_forge> NUT COOL OAT!
[2:30:42] <%Sir_stride> yup
[2:30:43] <%gatoralus> and its literally only for this sidequest from what i've seen
[2:30:45] <%Ultimatefool> Can Square pls remake Xenogears next, that one wasn't even finished and deserves it
[2:30:46] <%dukenux> Tremors is a great movie BTW
[2:30:47] <%ahdurian> because it takes time to get out
[2:30:47] <%Solid_Stro> So deep... Kappa
[2:30:48] <%Dragon_Batman> Maybe to show off more experiment stuff
[2:30:49] <%Firgof> and their QA team must've been *constantly yelling* about quality of life features
[2:30:50] <%siamzero94> 'cause behemoth
[2:30:51] <%Sir_stride> and you dont wanna walk all the way back
[2:30:52] <%Movemeister> TREMORS Kappa
[2:30:53] <%YakumoYomi> They came from underground!
[2:30:54] <%galaxyswirl> is it okay to ask what ch pat is on?
[2:31:01] <%Keyd00d> get a feeling so complicated
[2:31:05] <%DukeBlack_> @Ultimatefool Monolithsoft needs to remake that
[2:31:10] <%Aracon_> there definitely is
[2:31:14] <%Keyd00d> Yeah
[2:31:15] <%TimetodiveLTX> totally
[2:31:15] <%AmericanaRed> 76 GOOD? WTF
[2:31:15] <%ScottishMadJacko> For the next games yeah
[2:31:17] <%Dragon_Batman> totally
[2:31:19] <%gatoralus> oh yeah for sure
[2:31:20] <%BonewheelVanguard> "fuck you let me in" "sir the door is open"
[2:31:20] <%Pyroclase> They spend sooo much time laying down new and old plotlines, too
[2:31:21] <%j0ustar> Yep
[2:31:23] <%Firgof> Mhmmm
[2:31:25] <%dukenux> that's good, right?
[2:31:26] <%JoshyJ> god i hope so
[2:31:27] <%Keyd00d> No the next game will be an RTS
[2:31:28] <%Dragon_Batman> The hard part is done just gotta build more
[2:31:29] <%RetroCop87> Square built this game in 3 years, no?
[2:31:30] <%Aracon_> which would explain the game being 100GB
[2:31:30] <%furiousfurioso> a lot of teleportation features for when you don't have to walk that far, yea
[2:31:32] <%Caped_Eggy> Like babies
[2:31:33] <%Sir_stride> a blueprint if you will
[2:31:33] <%Shadicara> I hope they totally forget about all the features in the next one Kappa
[2:31:34] <%YakumoYomi> Develop the framework in this game, and the sequels will be easier to develop
[2:31:34] <%Guardiansaiyan> so new game in 2022?
[2:31:36] <%ChaosAethr> OH BOI
[2:31:37] <%Firgof> They *BETTER KEEP THIS QA TEAM BECAUSE IT IS A GREAT ONE*.
[2:31:38] <%PocketChange117> How many games total you think?
[2:31:38] <%JohnAtDawn> More power to the dev team
[2:31:38] <%furiousfurioso> tomatoDread
[2:31:38] <%broth_elemental> Like REmake 3
[2:31:40] <%siamzero94> i wonder what that is?
[2:31:40] <%Legato_Ambrose> YEYEYEYEYEYE
[2:31:41] <%wsintai> I want them all to have a different game engine, genre, and artstyle
[2:31:41] <%JohnAtDawn> 3
[2:31:42] <%dukenux> Next game will be an open world autochess
[2:31:42] <%mechslayer71> For sure
[2:31:42] <%ahdurian> and even in future installments Pat wont use the full materia screen FeelsBadMan
[2:31:43] <%gatoralus> 2021 or 2022 for next part im guessing
[2:31:43] <%j0ustar> Not just these from the looks of it
[2:31:46] <%axiomthunder> 4
[2:31:47] <%Legato_Ambrose> 3
[2:31:47] <%galaxyswirl> i heard next one coming 2021
[2:31:47] <%Keyd00d> 4
[2:31:47] <%Pyroclase> If the next games are on the next gen consoles, how much will they crank up the graphics?
[2:31:48] <%ringabal> Now that most of the main character rigging is done, there's more room to breath
[2:31:48] <%ChaosAethr> 3
[2:31:48] <%JoshyJ> 3 or 4
[2:31:48] <%Aracon_> probably 4
[2:31:50] <%Legato_Ambrose> 4?
[2:31:55] <%Dragon_Batman> I'm thinkin 3
[2:31:55] <%AmericanaRed> 10
[2:31:56] <%Sir_stride> 3 to 4
[2:31:57] <%TimetodiveLTX> 7 hurr hurr
[2:31:57] <%Shadicara> 7 to hit the title number LUL
[2:31:57] <%ratreborn> hoping just 3
[2:31:57] <%ChaosAethr> hoping 3
[2:31:57] <%Guardiansaiyan> 69
[2:31:58] <%cvp5127> not 2
[2:31:58] <%cylish> Dont forget this ones getting dlc as well
[2:31:59] <%valkuma> FF 7.77 FF7.88 and FF7.99
[2:32:00] <%wsintai> At LEAST 3, for sure
[2:32:00] <%Zutrax> I'm in the camp of 4 assuming they all sell okay
[2:32:02] <%Dragon_Batman> 3 discs like the og
[2:32:02] <%Keyd00d> IF they flesh out every location like they did this it'll be 4 at least
[2:32:04] <%spiritofmojave> yes you are
[2:32:04] <%logoth_> It should be 3
[2:32:04] <%DeoxysPrime> They'll condense stuff down to 3
[2:32:04] <%Solid_Stro> Imagine part 2 will have trinity limits like in Kingdom Hearts.
[2:32:05] <%cowardman93> 7 Parts psaDab
[2:32:07] <%Legato_Ambrose> I just figured 3 cause 3 discs ye
[2:32:10] <%ringabal> FF7 3.0 + 1.0
[2:32:10] <%Aracon_> especially if this is how they're doing it like we're still not at the world map
[2:32:10] <%PocketChange117> Wow man that's insane
[2:32:10] <%rytyoung> So there will be 8 playable characters in the next part hopefully
[2:32:11] <%Keyd00d> What?
[2:32:12] <%Legato_Ambrose> WHAT
[2:32:12] <%ScreamLord> I just hope Part 2 is a little more open and less restrictive
[2:32:12] <%wsintai> I havent heard that
[2:32:13] <%RetroCop87> ????
[2:32:13] <%AmericanaRed> PS6 EXCLUSIVE

[2:33:50] <%unstablebeast19> you should really use lifesaver on barrett, it helps ALOT
[2:33:52] <%Legato_Ambrose> It's just SO MAD

[2:34:15] <%CelioHogane> IT'S A SOLDIER DOG, FOURTH CLASS
[2:34:19] <%Firgof> This is the only Undertale reference they could make
[2:34:19] <%Shadicara> LUL
[2:34:20] <%Piemono> You can always go back to Easy Mode
[2:34:22] <%flagi64> NORMAL MODE ENGAGED
[2:34:22] <%ringabal> PERFECT
[2:34:22] <%Metballs> Just swap back to easy mode

[2:34:28] <%Aracon_> DOLPHIN
[2:34:29] <%dukenux> Biggs solo DLC, that happens before the game, and is just Apocalypse Now
[2:34:32] <%Aracon_> DOLPHIN FLURRY DO IT
[2:34:35] <%wsintai> NORMAL MODE HAS BEEN UNLOCKED?
[2:34:36] <%Aracon_> awwwww
[2:34:41] <%furiousfurioso> it was probably weak to magic
[2:34:42] <%ScottishMadJacko> Damnit pat

[2:34:56] <%Firgof> don't worry path
[2:34:57] <%ringabal> @PatStaresAt Did you max out Barret's Claw ability?
[2:34:59] <%BallerSwagBro9k> @ahdurian Nah we getting Johnny DLC
[2:35:00] <%dukenux> or maybe Hot Shots 2
[2:35:02] <%Firgof> There's *plenty of time* for limit breaks
[2:35:11] <%Aracon_> we'll probably see it vs behemoth
[2:35:13] <%Pyroclase> All the DLC does is add new dresses for Cloud
[2:35:25] <%ahdurian> imagine only using physical attacks with a magic-heavy weapon
[2:35:25] <%CelioHogane> @Pyroclase only if i can use them in combat.
[2:35:33] <%Shadicara> Gun
[2:35:33] <%DeoxysPrime> GUN better
[2:35:34] <%heartlesshealer> gun man need to shoot
[2:35:35] <%ScottishMadJacko> Barret is better ranged
[2:35:36] <%Dragon_Batman> his range is super helpful
[2:35:36] <%valkuma> melee barret is so wrong
[2:35:36] <%ratreborn> the guns more useful
[2:35:38] <%snow_bush> DLC Replaces cloud with Lightning
[2:35:41] <%Shadicara> Gun is man's greatest weapon
[2:35:42] <%rytyoung> Barrett is not a melee character
[2:35:44] <%CelioHogane> @snow_bush NO
[2:35:46] <%Aracon_> his range is his defining trait after all
[2:35:47] <%YakumoYomi> @Pyroclase The last dress just turns him into Lightning
[2:35:48] <%Solid_Stro> KH1 Cloud outfit DLC
[2:35:52] <%Caped_Eggy> You need range in the party
[2:35:53] <%CelioHogane> YE
[2:35:55] <%Firgof> Tifa turns into Prompto
[2:35:57] <%Legato_Ambrose> Yeah, melee Barett's fun for a sec, but there's no replacing his range
[2:35:57] <%ringabal> HP go UP
[2:35:59] <%CelioHogane> KH1 CLOUD FOR THE BEST
[2:36:00] <%wsintai> The last dress turns him into GACKT
[2:36:03] <%siamzero94> melee will fuck up some bosses so go ranged
[2:36:04] <%Solid_Stro> come on Nomura!
[2:36:08] <%coreyyotto> You guys are just listing improvements
[2:36:10] <%CelioHogane> @Firgof wouldn't Barret turn into prompto?
[2:36:15] <%Firgof> Nah
[2:36:19] <%floralkami> if you have the skill, you can just map it to you quick select, right?
[2:36:21] <%superstarsage> I can't wait for FF7R Part 2.7 Movie Edition so everyone can catch up when part 3 releases which also comes with a playable crisis core remake of Zack's career during the Wutai war
[2:36:22] <%Big_McLarge_Huge> !uptime
[2:36:23] <@Moobot> I've been playing this game for how long? Oh only 2h 36m.
[2:36:24] <%axiomthunder> i cant wait for the pc version so i can play as cloud in a dress the whole time
[2:36:32] <%CelioHogane> Prompto is the funniest character to play in FFXV
[2:36:33] <%YakumoYomi> Melee Barrett feels like his attacks are too slow to be as useful as ranged
[2:36:33] <%ringabal> THE BEST MATERIA IN THE GAME
[2:36:36] <%Shadicara> Tiny numbers go up
[2:36:54] <%Legato_Ambrose> Yes... The "Cloud Dress" mod... Definitely what I am looking forward to, too...
[2:36:57] <%Shadicara> LUL
[2:36:57] <%Firgof> it feels like this whole area is 'here are enemies that'll be more common in Game 2'
[2:37:02] <%Solid_Stro> The Wutai subplot is interesting. Wonder if they’ll build up to another war in the sequels
[2:37:05] <%coreyyotto> It had shell on
[2:37:14] <%Shadicara> It's got a big shield on pat
[2:37:15] <%ahdurian> Manawall
[2:37:16] <%heartlesshealer> It had a shield on
[2:37:20] <%baronblank> use magic on the one immune to physical
[2:37:23] <%Felto3> green shield = magic immune
[2:37:23] <%Guardiansaiyan> DROP THE SHIELD
[2:37:25] <%Caped_Eggy> Green light means immune to magic
[2:37:34] <%Guardiansaiyan> KNOW WHAT I MENA?!
[2:37:36] <%Firgof> *immediately hit*
[2:37:37] <%Treuan> Well, it was a shell of a good hit
[2:37:39] <%croxeye> the wutai thing feels super false tbh, just shinra propeganda at it's finest, even those who don't like shinra don't trust wutai
[2:37:50] <%Dragon_Batman> Those blue monodrives can be a pain
[2:37:56] <%CelioHogane> @Firgof i don't know, i don't think we will see that many robot things in Junon
[2:37:56] <%tizz86> @solid_stro sqeenix really is driving home the "remake" instead of remaster with this entry
[2:37:57] <%Pyroclase> I mean it's obviously false, the characters have no idea what Shinra's talking about
[2:38:04] <%Pyroclase> unless it's a different cell who worked with Wutai
[2:38:07] <%heartlesshealer> Subversion might help if you expect to fight those a lot maybe?
[2:38:08] <%rytyoung> @dragon_batman It was the first enemy I died to in the game BibleThump
[2:38:13] <%Firgof> @CelioHogane I could see it, especially as we get into BIG GUN TOWN.
[2:38:16] <%Shadicara> This looks like what FF13 wanted to be
[2:38:26] <%axiomthunder> ture
[2:38:26] <%Solid_Stro> @croxeye But if Shinra is goating the population against Wutai then we could see another conflict
[2:38:29] <%Dragon_Batman> @rytyoung Same, that first time with Aerith fuckin wrecked me
[2:38:30] <%ahdurian> "thats how it works" i dont think he knows how it works
[2:38:33] <%croxeye> i mean, yes that's exactly what it was in the OG, but i dunno if they decided to expand the conflict in this game
[2:38:42] <%CelioHogane> @Firgof do you think Part 2 will end before or exactly in cosmo canyon?
[2:39:06] <%rytyoung> @dragon_batman Yup, the sidequest where you have to fight 2 at a time, with no subversion materia, thanks Nomura LUL
[2:39:08] <%Firgof> I expect Part 2 to end in the submarine or in the manor's basement just to defy everyone's expectations
[2:39:09] <%siamzero94> Part 2 ends in nibelheim
[2:39:12] <%Legato_Ambrose> Part two I'd hope would go all the way to City of the Ancients
[2:39:13] <%SH1NK1R0> @pyroclase you learn in chapter 4 that avalanche hq actually is working with Syria. Biggs literally tells you. Shinra just had no proof so used our cell to convince the people without needing it.
[2:39:17] <%Dragon_Batman> @rytyoung LUL
[2:39:25] <%Robot_Nixon_> Like is the Wutai even that big of a threat to Shinra? Lore wise I thought it was just that small town
[2:39:28] <%axiomthunder> i agree @siamzero94
[2:39:30] <%ahdurian> Part 2 is definitely Nibelheim or Temple
[2:39:32] <%floralkami> imagine if one of the Remake parts included Crisis Core as playable flashbacks?
[2:39:33] <%SH1NK1R0> Wutai* my phone corrected it for some reason
[2:39:43] <%wsintai> Part 2 will end 2 minutes after it starts, with Cloud dying of a stroke and everyone giving up
[2:39:49] <%Solid_Stro> Part 2 will end with your date with Barret
[2:39:52] <%heartlesshealer> !
[2:39:54] <%Guardiansaiyan> @wsintai if only lol
[2:39:59] <%Firgof> Also I am increasingly certain that it will be *impossible* to miss Vampboy.
[2:40:00] <%CelioHogane> @Firgof that sounds A LOT of content for part 2 compared to Midgar, tho.
[2:40:01] <%Legato_Ambrose> Your date with Cid*

[2:42:16] <%CelioHogane> @wsintai also, i don't think disc size was a problem for THIS game, more like overall content, this game isn't short at all.
[2:42:20] <%Ultimatefool> If only you could switch to Boxma- I mean Barret
[2:42:22] <%TalisKanju> Wait, Pat isn't doing the sidequests?

[2:42:53] <%ScreamLord> @PatStaresAt Delicious, I have no idea what that is
[2:42:53] <%heartlesshealer> pat you might want to think about that sentence
[2:42:53] <@commanderclaw> Does Samus have a cloaca? She's part bird
[2:42:55] <%rytyoung> STILL
[2:42:55] <%Laecerelius> Oh! So an X-Com Viper waifu Barbie!
[2:42:56] <%YakumoYomi> Did someone say "cloaca"?
[2:42:56] <%Auctorian> DOn't google it. Don't. Just don't.
[2:42:56] <%Ultimatefool> Growly-rowly
[2:42:59] <%spiritofmojave> pat explain
[2:42:59] <%floralkami> WHOS COOKING?
[2:43:00] <%wsintai> @CelioHogane True, the limitations came more in the obvious loading hallways
[2:43:07] <%heartlesshealer> a Barbie with a cloaca...
[2:43:07] <%Guardiansaiyan> @floralkami paige
[2:43:20] <%ospreyworks> Peach can you share your quarantine recipes on Twitter?
[2:43:26] <%Aracon_> barret wants to go murder
[2:43:27] <%floralkami> @guardiansaiyan ..... WHOS SANDBAGGING?
[2:43:28] <%ScottishMadJacko> God i cant wait to play through this again on the ps5, and the sequels too
[2:43:29] <%rytyoung> Elmo cooks on Sunday's
[2:43:36] <%Mornaka> yup
[2:43:37] <%axiomthunder> @PatStaresAt have you seen the movie The Lighthouse? cloaca brings up memories
[2:43:37] <%Guardiansaiyan> @floralkami but..she did cook
[2:43:38] <%Firgof> he was tho
[2:43:39] <%Shady_Squid> @commanderclaw I thought cloaca's were like, a reptile thing?
[2:43:43] <%Legato_Ambrose> yeah, you even head the behemoth growl as Barret
[2:43:45] <%Pyroclase> Didn't you even see the sealed-off door to the behemoth?
[2:43:47] <%ringabal> What does Elmo cook?
[2:43:49] <%Pyroclase> It was covered in tape
[2:43:52] <%suikudo> @Shady_Squid nah birds i think
[2:43:53] <%Axellogic> You missed it
[2:43:53] <%cowardman93> does Elmo just cook a big pile of his own hair?
[2:43:53] <%rytyoung> knew it
[2:43:54] <%TimetodiveLTX> hair
[2:43:54] <%heartlesshealer> yeah
[2:43:55] <%TalisKanju> Elmo definitely cooks on Sundays
[2:43:57] <%Firgof> the *sealed-off door to the Woolie Hole
[2:43:57] <%Dragon_Batman> Quarantine happened
[2:43:59] <%cvp5127> cabin fever
[2:44:02] <%CelioHogane> @wsintai I am certain Junon and Gold Saucer are going to be bigger (Specially Gold saucer that i expect to be three times bigger), so i personally think Cosmo Canyon could be pushing it.
[2:44:03] <%floralkami> @guardiansaiyan *sigh* you're lucky you're precious
[2:44:03] <%prism_zet> brainwashing
[2:44:04] <%Aracon_> quarantine turning her into something else
[2:44:04] <@SoFarFetched> Can't believe Paige is actually a nice lady.
[2:44:05] <%Axellogic> You passed it
[2:44:06] <%coreyyotto> Honestly I would be mad if he had noticed it right away
[2:44:10] <%asgard147> limesS
[2:44:11] <%siamzero94> you missed the behemoth door
[2:44:16] <%ape_hawk> the covid 19 makes you nicer until it kills u
[2:44:16] <%Firgof> I am really interested in what they're going to do with Golden Saucer
[2:44:16] <%ringabal> THE DOOR TO DARKNESS?
[2:44:17] <%reinbachthe3rd> Sounds welcoming.
[2:44:19] <%plus_on_black> that boy loves his oj
[2:44:20] <%furiousfurioso> tomatoConcern
[2:44:21] <%siamzero94> HAVE FUN!
[2:44:21] <%YakumoYomi> My Paige Can't Be This Sweet
[2:44:22] <%SH1NK1R0> Yeah the only thing that wasn’t achievable due to console hardware was framrate and loading times. The texture issue isn’t due to console it’s an unreal thing that they need to iron out. Ps5 and pc releases will likely make this game unbelievable
[2:44:22] <%Guardiansaiyan> @floralkami lol...how did you access me as such?
[2:44:22] <%wsintai> @SoFarFetched Its a trick, dont fall for it!
[2:44:22] <%Treuan> "Isn't she so sweet" - the man who had a domestic over a ham sandwich

[2:46:37] <%NitronStreams> Hey guys do you like Monster Hunter?
[2:46:38] <%CelioHogane> @siamzero94 also the fact everybody is high schooler makes the character design pretty bland in comparation to the rest of the games.
[2:46:39] <%tigerfang86> We have a greatsword, LBG, and Dual Blades team right now
[2:46:42] <%coreyyotto> FLAWLESS
[2:46:42] <%heartlesshealer> MAGIC sword
[2:46:44] <%tizz86> @legato_ambrose the entire game on NORMAL isn't that much of a challenge outside of the occasional spike
[2:46:47] <%tigerfang86> how are we gonna handle behemothhhhhhhhh
[2:46:53] <%Aracon_> oooooo the combo
[2:46:53] <%Verd_254> we got air combos

[2:47:03] <%floralkami> @guardiansaiyan i was making a "Who's talking!?!" joke and you sandbagged me at every turn :(
[2:47:05] <%asgard147> limesS
[2:47:10] <%ScottishMadJacko> @Guardiansaiyan True, they could use leshens rigging too
[2:47:13] <%siamzero94> @CelioHogane Ok there i have to disagree i love the uniform shit
[2:47:13] <%prism_zet> tifa dead
[2:47:14] <%Dragon_Batman> Jumping heavy in to sweep always good
[2:47:16] <%axiomthunder> tifa is fucking dead
[2:47:20] <%plus_on_black> stride juggles lol
[2:47:23] <%CelioHogane> Do you think this Behemoth is actually Woolie pumped with Mako?
[2:47:24] <%tizz86> @legato_ambrose i was breezing through hard until chapter 9.....
[2:47:26] <%Aracon_> YEYEYEYEYEYE
[2:47:26] <%Pyroclase> Tifa ain't dead no more
[2:47:30] <%KawaiiJetty> Tekken 6 boss got nothing on this cool combo
[2:47:30] <%siamzero94> also jesus this fight is a clusterfuck
[2:47:32] <%Sir_stride> @plus_on_black ?
[2:47:33] <%prism_zet> @dragon_batman only three times then people get wise
[2:47:34] <%Ultimatefool> Barret is too slow to be LBG, HBG for sure
[2:47:34] <%Guardiansaiyan> @floralkami I am sorry! I do not talk to many people and this is the only time I am really social so...didn't recognize it
[2:47:35] <%tigerfang86> SICK
[2:47:35] <%Keyd00d> DOLPHIN
[2:47:36] <%Legato_Ambrose> Honestly only two or three points where I got stumped just because I was too dumbbrained to understand how to beat this/that/the other monster
[2:47:37] <%Firgof> 'let's turn this arounGUHhaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaa-'
[2:47:38] <%Guardiansaiyan> @floralkami T_T

[2:47:56] <%doc_ock_rokc> TIFA HAS BECOME MAY
[2:47:58] <%DukeBlack_> This Behemoth listens to Prince
[2:48:00] <%CelioHogane> @siamzero94 sure, for one, or two, but then is like "WICH HIGHSCHOOL UNIFORM GENERIC CHARACTER WILL I PICK"
[2:48:01] <%Ultimatefool> psaUp
[2:48:05] <%Aracon_> poor tifa
[2:48:06] <%reinbachthe3rd> Tifa got dunked on.
[2:48:08] <%plus_on_black> @sir_stride Not you my guy haha.
[2:48:09] <%weissguard> Tifa is great. Holy hell.
[2:48:10] <%Dragon_Batman> That's when empty jump low comes in
[2:48:13] <%SH1NK1R0> After beating it on hard I legitimately feel like there needs to be an in between difficulty for first playthrough as hard felt so much more satisfying but makes returns to normal feel just comically easy
[2:48:17] <%Keyd00d> Some fanservice for the beast lovers
[2:48:21] <%CelioHogane> @siamzero94 Final Fantasy 8 did high school clothes better.
[2:48:21] <%ScottishMadJacko> That tail is prime for severing and carving
[2:48:26] <%NitronStreams> Ok everyone: buh-HEE-muth or beh-heh-moth?

[2:50:38] <%siamzero94> @CelioHogane I like the blue, but the pants on the guys suck, too baggy for a unform
[2:50:44] <%GohanHitsugaya> Just offer it some head, then you'll be able to kill it in it's sleep afterwords.
[2:50:47] <%Aracon_> 0MP nairoS
[2:50:48] <%mechslayer71> He’s not focusing the upper/lower body enough, every single hit needs to go one, then the other to get at the horn

[2:55:10] <%tigerfang86> the PLANET THO
[2:55:10] <%siamzero94> RESTART
[2:55:11] <%Legato_Ambrose> She reads the script to know when Behemoth sleep
[2:55:11] <%ScottishMadJacko> Limit breaks deal enough damage wuthout stagger
[2:55:12] <%Firgof> I guess she's so nice to it it just gives it to her???
[2:55:13] <%Treuan> Aerith lifts
[2:55:13] <%TimetodiveLTX> theft is wrong chat
[2:55:15] <%Engwithan_Elder_God> She probably knows where there's dead ones.
[2:55:15] <%rufus2k2> SHE WORKS HARD FOR THE MONEY
[2:55:16] <@SoFarFetched> Cause Aerith would talk to behemoth and be like "ahehehehe...goood doggie"
[2:55:19] <%cowardman93> limit is better to get the stagger it builds it near instantly
[2:55:19] <%rufus2k2> SO HARD FOR HER HONEY
[2:55:20] <%KasiCrafter> She talk to them all sweet-like.

[2:55:23] <%Caped_Eggy> Well, I don't think it's good
[2:55:24] <%Guardiansaiyan> @TimetodiveLTX except when its right

[2:55:31] <%Aracon_> LUL
[2:55:31] <%Shadicara> To not use it
[2:55:32] <%MegboyManuel> you suck at stealth, thats how she got them
[2:55:34] <%cowardman93> Aerith asked very nicely

[2:55:41] <%weissguard> The Type-0 Behemoth has a deal with Ass4Dayzzz
[2:55:42] <%heartlesshealer> it doesn't even level
[2:55:43] <%SH1NK1R0> This behemoth is a manufactured creature it can’t actually cast meteor but it instinctively tries anyway. Also you are underground so it wouldn’t hit you anyway
[2:55:43] <%DukeBlack_> yeah
[2:55:47] <%Dragon_Batman> Shure why not
[2:55:50] <%GohanHitsugaya> The only thing worth stealing is the weapon you already stole
[2:55:53] <%rufus2k2> wait it doesn't become mug anymore?
[2:55:53] <%prism_zet> no mug in this game unfortunately
[2:55:53] <%tizz86> aerith feeds and has long chats with monsters, they give her shit for free

[3:00:13] <%Tiewolf> shit taste like soap
[3:00:14] <%Legato_Ambrose> He died
[3:00:15] <%Guardiansaiyan> @ChaosAethr yes
[3:00:15] <%tigerfang86> HE HAS THE GENE
[3:00:15] <%TalisKanju> Cilantro tastes like soap to some people
[3:00:16] <%SH1NK1R0> Deadly dodge with hp absorb is great
[3:00:17] <%Firgof> :' (
[3:00:17] <@SoFarFetched> HE'S GOT THE WEIRD THING
[3:00:18] <%tigerfang86> HE HAS IT
[3:00:18] <%Scarnehu> ***chakra
[3:00:19] <%spiritofmojave> I agree cilantro is garbage
[3:00:19] <%코코꾸라> HE HAS THE GENE
[3:00:21] <%GohanHitsugaya> Wow that suck buddy
[3:00:21] <%heartlesshealer> Oh no, he has the leaf bane
[3:00:21] <%Dragon_Batman> Fair
[3:00:24] <%tizz86> @axellogic figured as much, I'll pick a chapter with all 3 in party
[3:00:25] <%ChaosAethr> Oh how was that
[3:00:25] <%Zombrocom> Oh sucks to be you
[3:00:26] <%j0ustar> poor Pat
[3:00:27] <%logoth_> The soap gene
[3:00:28] <%valriot> CURSED JEANS
[3:00:28] <%Pyroclase> I'm sure Pat has many genetic things
[3:00:31] <%GohanHitsugaya> Cilantro is so good.
[3:00:32] <%CelioHogane> @Guardiansaiyan If you think about it, summon boss fights are you fighting against Chadley's code
[3:00:32] <%tigerfang86> THE CURSED GENE
[3:00:34] <%Rafferty3231> I want tacos now :(
[3:00:35] <%Treuan> He has obtained the inferior, recessive genes!
[3:00:35] <%ringabal> Genetics are nuts
[3:00:36] <%Caped_Eggy> Pat's a mutent
[3:00:38] <%YakumoYomi> Try Whack a Box again?
[3:00:40] <%tiaramaki> Dat soaplantro gene
[3:00:41] <%Tiewolf> SOoo it's just not me!!! @PatStaresAt I thought I was crazy!! Omg
[3:00:41] <%TalisKanju> Pat should probably eat more bars of soap
[3:00:45] <%NitronStreams> Pat is a GENETIC FREAK
[3:00:45] <%rufus2k2> who would win, a rotund ginger dwarf, or 1 leafy boi
[3:00:53] <%heartlesshealer> hair color's also pointless, just the soap gene is touching a sensory input
[3:00:55] <%Dragon_Batman> clean the mouth real good
[3:00:56] <%Firgof> so what do you gain for no cilantro
[3:00:59] <%ringabal> YEAH
[3:00:59] <%rufus2k2> he's not a melee player, guise
[3:01:00] <%CelioHogane> HOW DO YOU KNOW WHAT SOAP TASTES LIKE!?
[3:01:00] <%siamzero94> you just have to power through it and your body will conform
[3:01:01] <%spiritofmojave> wait do I have fucced cilantro soap genes too? oh no
[3:01:04] <%Guardiansaiyan> @CelioHogane dang...that means if he becomes a proper super villian he might rival Shrina
[3:01:05] <%TenguGemini> TenguGemini subscribed at Tier 1. They've subscribed for 3 months, currently on a 1 month streak! tasting like soap is still better than tasting like (yellow) mustard
[3:01:05] <%reinbachthe3rd> EMLO

[3:01:11] <%tiaramaki> psaPorgmo psaPorgmo psaPorgmo psaPorgmo
[3:01:12] <%Pyroclase> I had to look that up but it's apparently a real thing
[3:01:13] <%코코꾸라> If cilantro tastes like soap, does soap taste like cilantro?
[3:01:17] <%Felto3> pat you completed the quest in the park
[3:01:17] <%Hellarussian> smellmo
[3:01:17] <%NitronStreams> 🎵🎵🎵🎵🎵
[3:01:20] <%CelioHogane> @Guardiansaiyan to be fair, his objective is fuck Shinra up
[3:01:23] <%barrakuta371> I keep thinking Pat saying WalMart

[3:01:26] <%spiritofmojave> @cocokkura time to taste test :)
[3:01:31] <%Pyroclase> that was on funky loading screen
[3:01:32] <%doc_ock_rokc> Does someone have to play that song for the chocobos to move?
[3:01:33] <%Guardiansaiyan> @CelioHogane then buy their stock and bonds
[3:01:34] <%ringabal> No Deadly Premonition Car Screech 0/10

[3:02:00] <%GohanHitsugaya> What's Section 9 doing in this game?

[3:02:43] <%spiritofmojave> that ones the best oneee
[3:02:46] <%Axellogic> Firaga first strike on cloud will make the arena a joke

[3:16:04] <%YakumoYomi> SIX materia slots
[3:16:04] <%ScreamLord> I think Barret gets more weapons than anyone else in the game
[3:16:04] <%prism_zet> ttake it
[3:16:11] <%tigerfang86> this ORB is HUGE
[3:16:15] <%Keyd00d> I think they all get equal amounts
[3:16:16] <%Guardiansaiyan> @SaphronBlackbourne everytime they are together is a group hug
[3:16:18] <%Metballs> Everyone egsts the same number of weapons
[3:16:18] <%CelioHogane> @ScreamLord nope, all have the same number
[3:16:24] <%NitronStreams> 6 SLOT more than enough to kill anything that moves
[3:16:24] <%KawaiiJetty> It's a materia ball weapon
[3:16:25] <%prism_zet> corrext
[3:16:26] <%ChaosAethr> That alot of slots

[3:16:31] <%StaceMcGate> We still chapter 14?
[3:16:32] <%mechslayer71> @screamlord they all get 6
[3:16:32] <%Guardiansaiyan> @tigerfang86 Pat was offended by that
[3:16:34] <%Firgof> Barrett's weapons are just less easy to miss
[3:16:34] <%Dragon_Batman> Bertha is still dope but for now
[3:16:34] <%cvp5127> just get the skill
[3:16:35] <%Garthunox> @patstaresat I'm sure you heard but the original voice of Leon died from cancer earlier this week
[3:16:39] <%conradical> i think Barret's guns are way better than his melee options
[3:16:39] <%Aracon_> just use it to get smackdown
[3:16:39] <%siamzero94> @Guardiansaiyan how long does a stream normally take?

[3:16:49] <%StaceMcGate> ty
[3:16:51] <%MalekDracarus> Bertha is real dope
[3:16:57] <%Pyroclase> Bertha confuses me, because it's a giant cannon revolver that shoots like a machine gun

[3:18:50] <%Pyroclase> I keep hearing prayer is amazing
[3:18:52] <@SoFarFetched> Yeah Pat pretty much said they probably wouldn't talk FF7R on the next podcast. Since Pat knew he probably wouldn't finish by then.
[3:18:53] <%ape_hawk> yeah, but mag+haste/barrier is great
[3:18:58] <%Dragon_Batman> Pray is great
[3:18:58] <%rytyoung> It's worth it for hard mode
[3:18:58] <%ScottishMadJacko> next FF7 stream wednesday then? or skipping p5 to finish ff7
[3:18:59] <%Guardiansaiyan> @Shadicara hip hop de chocobo
[3:19:02] <%Metballs> Prayer is 11/10 on hard
[3:19:03] <@SoFarFetched> and who knows when Woolie will finish FF7R with how much he's gotta play LUL
[3:19:04] <%tigerfang86> YEAH PUNCH EM BARRETT
[3:19:05] <%Metballs> Where MP is limited
[3:19:06] <%ALazo> I hate that this is a loading song so much
[3:19:06] <%Ranryu692> magnify regen though
[3:19:08] <%CelioHogane> Remember guys, Pat doesn't use limited items, so no ether this runs
[3:19:08] <%GohanHitsugaya> Damn
[3:19:08] <%ShichiNoBushi> 2 ATB vs. some MP.
[3:19:08] <%ape_hawk> damn, barret
[3:19:09] <%Piemen99> NICE
[3:19:09] <%Aracon_> OOF
[3:19:10] <%ringabal> HERE COMES THE BIG DOG
[3:19:11] <%NitronStreams> SICK
[3:19:11] <%TurtlesAndTentacles> Hey Im just here to watch. I have no Advice lol
[3:19:12] <%bevyrage> holy fuck
[3:19:14] <%Axellogic> Smash
[3:19:15] <%conradical> nice job barret
[3:19:16] <%broth_elemental> Pray is amazing
[3:19:21] <%KawaiiJetty> gg
[3:19:21] <%Keyd00d> If it works for you then it's good
[3:19:24] <%conradical> barret is like 50 cal
[3:19:25] <%Tearonex> yeah, prayer and chakra are essential on hard mode
[3:19:26] <%ChaosAethr> Pray is best for cost
[3:19:26] <%siamzero94> @PatStaresAt you have plenty of aether though
[3:19:27] <%SGrim> Big-number Barrett psaBig psaUp
[3:19:27] <%DXLelouch24> Id link AP up with Revival cause it takes Forever to level and you need all magic materia maxed for the final Summon
[3:19:33] <%Keyd00d> Wait, full heal?
[3:19:33] <%ape_hawk> its not a full heal
[3:19:35] <%Mornaka> @ShichiNoBushi but atb is effectively infinite
[3:19:37] <%ape_hawk> its a party heal
[3:19:38] <%GohanHitsugaya> He love barret
[3:19:41] <%cvp5127> prayer and chakra are great
[3:19:42] <%CelioHogane> @siamzero94 he will never use Ether, it's a non infinite item
[3:19:44] <%Keyd00d> Oh that's what he means
[3:19:44] <%AgniBrandt> I have Magnify linked to Barrier, myself.
[3:19:56] <%SH1NK1R0> Pray is actually really great as in hard you can literally never get mp back outside of boxes and passive regen
[3:19:57] <%conradical> mp deez nuts
[3:20:01] <%NitronStreams> im getting steam stutter any ine else?
[3:20:04] <%siamzero94> @CelioHogane Right mind goblins i keep forgetting
[3:20:07] <%Keyd00d> SMACKDOWN
[3:20:07] <%Dragon_Batman> Mag barrier or haste is just great
[3:20:14] <%bevyrage> yeah prayer use to be aerith's unique skill didn't it? i only remember her having it in original
[3:20:19] <%Aracon_> honestly the only upside to magnify cure is probably doing mgnify regen
[3:20:26] <%iwa5h4ck3d> @SH1NK1R0 You get mp from taking damage form one of the wepon tree
[3:20:31] <%ScreamLord> @PatStaresAt And Pray only needs 1 slot, where as Cure needs to be linked with Magnify to do a party heal
[3:20:39] <%Dragon_Batman> LUL
[3:20:39] <%Nobrev> I use my magnify for haste. Pray is more than enough for party healing
[3:20:40] <%Shadicara> LUL
[3:20:54] <%ape_hawk> hit more
[3:21:06] <%AgniBrandt> I'm debating switching magnify from Barrier to Time...
[3:21:06] <%Dragon_Batman> Using it more will do as well
[3:21:23] <%DXLelouch24> Using it works as well
[3:21:25] <%Aracon_> yeah magnify haste is pretty amazing
[3:21:35] <%CelioHogane> @AgniBrandt just get another Magnify psaSmug
[3:21:37] <%SH1NK1R0> Magnify is actually best used on support spells over damage as there aren’t a lot of fights where there’s tons of enemies that all share the same weakness. Magnify cure on aerith is a mega potion aoe, magnify time materia lets you use haste,slow and stop in aoe
[3:21:41] <%DXLelouch24> We better get more than one magnify in part 2
[3:21:45] <%YakumoYomi> @Aracon_ I'd imagine magnified Curaga is going to be a stronger heal that Pray...but it's also overkill unless you need to panic heal 3000+ HP
[3:21:49] <%DXLelouch24> One isnt enough damit
[3:21:52] <%GohanHitsugaya> Smack that Smogger
[3:21:53] <%bread_assassin> The game really oughta give you more than one magnify,
[3:21:53] <%AgniBrandt> @CelioHogane Are there 2? I've only found one.
[3:22:02] <%CelioHogane> @AgniBrandt new game plus, no?
[3:22:16] <%ape_hawk> that materia is poi-son
[3:22:18] <%DXLelouch24> @celiohogane you cant theres only one Magnify
[3:22:18] <%Nobrev> Can I just say how fucking fun this game is? I'm redoing chapters to get all the stuff I missed and I'm still having a blast
[3:22:23] <%hardcore_violence> fish materia?
[3:22:29] <%DXLelouch24> Even in ng+
[3:22:29] <%AgniBrandt> Possibly! Depends on how they do it. I'm still working on my first playthrough.
[3:22:31] <%Aracon_> @YakumoYomi yeah magnify curaga is of course very powerful but curaga burns through MP super hard too
[3:22:31] <%CelioHogane> @DXLelouch24 can't you get a second one when you new game plus it?
[3:22:36] <%DXLelouch24> Nope
[3:22:38] <%ScottishMadJacko> I like that poison is actually good in this
[3:22:41] <%tigerfang86> this game is just really dope
[3:22:42] <%CelioHogane> That's bullshit
[3:22:46] <%SH1NK1R0> Magnify is only the one
[3:22:48] <%ape_hawk> @PatStaresAt are you gonna stream hard mode or do it alone?
[3:22:48] <%rytyoung> I'm on Ch 2 hard mode right now and I'm having a blast
[3:22:49] <%CelioHogane> I want 99 of everything
[3:22:50] <%Keyd00d> The game actually goes by fast on replay if you skip scenes
[3:22:51] <%valriot> Jumped into Maxs stream, holy FUCK GG Strives lobby is the WORST SHIT
[3:22:57] <%SaphronBlackbourne> It'll never happen but man I really want Tifa, Barret, and Aerith for Smash now too
[3:22:59] <%ape_hawk> k
[3:23:00] <%gatoralus> its just a dope ass VIDEOGAME CAPITAL V
[3:23:03] <%Pyroclase> I'm probably gonna wait until it goes on sale to get it
[3:23:04] <%cvp5127> fair
[3:23:05] <%conradical> i suck at hard mode. i didn't realize how often i use items
[3:23:06] <%Ranryu692> booooo P5
[3:23:07] <%Aracon_> I just beat some post game missions and am going through hard mode now
[3:23:08] <%Legato_Ambrose> awwwh booo, but yaaay more personers
[3:23:09] <%baronblank> I did literally everything there is to do in the game and I still have an urge to go back and play it more
[3:23:10] <%TurtlesAndTentacles> this is more than enough
[3:23:11] <%NitronStreams> my stream keeps stuttering during fights for some reason. its perfectly fine otherwise
[3:23:14] <%Keyd00d> I want the PC version already
[3:23:16] <%Dakuu75> first playthrough is deh sex. second playthrough, you're jsut cuddling
[3:23:18] <%Dragon_Batman> True
[3:23:20] <%Keyd00d> gotta wait so long
[3:23:25] <%tigerfang86> MORE PRAYER PogChamp
[3:23:26] <%Keyd00d> MORE PRAY
[3:23:27] <%tizz86> I'd love to see hard mode streamed
[3:23:29] <%cvp5127> PogChamp
[3:23:30] <%Legato_Ambrose> break box
[3:23:30] <%GohanHitsugaya> They're are different scenes if you pick aerith to love!
[3:23:33] <%코코꾸라> break the boxes too
[3:23:34] <%DXLelouch24> Hard mode has secret bosses as exclusive, atleast stream those
[3:23:36] <%Nobrev> The thing that makes me iffy about hard mode is benches dont refill MP
[3:23:38] <%Pyroclase> It's Pat mode.
[3:23:39] <%Sir_stride> boxes
[3:23:39] <%CelioHogane> Yeah pat LOVES to waste items
[3:23:40] <%ChaosAethr> BR%EAK BOX
[3:23:42] <%Mornaka> Pray 2, pray harder
[3:23:44] <%SaphronBlackbourne> I'd love more FF characters for Samsh in general
[3:23:46] <%Dragon_Batman> Gonna do boxes last huh? interesting
[3:23:49] <%TurtlesAndTentacles> Were the dragon gates an Wutai thing? or are those Conero?
[3:23:49] <%Daxalog> Is this still easy mode?
[3:23:50] <%tizz86> @nobrev yep, that's a bitch
[3:23:55] <%Legato_Ambrose> yeah, if benches still refilled MP, I'd be more on board with hard mode
[3:23:56] <%YakumoYomi> Don't forget to smash boxes
[3:23:57] <%Dakuu75> @DXLelouch24 neat, didn't know that
[3:23:59] <%mechslayer71> Benches also don’t give back MP @patstaresat
[3:24:05] <%Keyd00d> Key item
[3:24:05] <%Tearonex> I was farming these boxes for moogle medals for Hard mode
[3:24:06] <%ape_hawk> quest item
[3:24:08] <%SH1NK1R0> I’m about to platinum the game now. Hard mode was awesome
[3:24:14] <%prism_zet> boxes punk
[3:24:15] <%Keyd00d> Yep
[3:24:16] <%Dakuu75> wow

[3:24:22] <%ScreamLord> @PatStaresAt I WISH accessories appeared on the characters so we could see Barret wearing that Tiara

[3:24:26] <%prism_zet> boxes

[3:24:28] <%GohanHitsugaya> Then why bench

[3:24:31] <%siamzero94> MAKONITE
[3:24:31] <%ape_hawk> ethers

[3:24:32] <%Legato_Ambrose> MP from boxes and skills
[3:24:33] <%Pyroclase> Boxes only??
[3:24:34] <%tigerfang86> SO MUCH JUNK
[3:24:34] <%Keyd00d> Can't use items either
[3:24:34] <%Aracon_> you just do
[3:24:35] <%tizz86> yep, get that revive max
[3:24:35] <%코코꾸라> MP management
[3:24:36] <%VHGS> Just don't waste your shit
[3:24:37] <%prism_zet> its hard
[3:24:39] <%moogleboy1984> better get used to the taste of MP Regen + 50%
[3:24:39] <%ScreamLord> @PatStaresAt With Items dude
[3:24:40] <%Drowshall> boxes only
[3:24:41] <%Sir_stride> Just do
[3:24:41] <%Metballs> Just be smart
[3:24:41] <%Nobrev> @commanderclaw no items
[3:24:42] <%broth_elemental> Yes pat
[3:24:44] <%DXLelouch24> Gitgud scrub
[3:24:44] <%BallerSwagBro9k> you cant
[3:24:44] <%baronblank> save your mp
[3:24:44] <%ape_hawk> you cant use items in combat
[3:24:45] <%Cn_alpha_02> Boxes
[3:24:46] <%ringabal> psaGoblin psaGoblin psaGoblin for boxes
[3:24:46] <%TimetodiveLTX> items are for skrubz git gud
[3:24:47] <%ospreyworks> But baaabaaa
[3:24:48] <%Keyd00d> @ScreamLord no items
[3:24:49] <%Garthunox> @commanderclaw that you cant use?
[3:24:49] <%ScottishMadJacko> Mako shards and hope
[3:24:52] <%NitronStreams> this breaks the pat
[3:24:53] <%Sir_stride> MAKO SHARDS BABY
[3:24:56] <%weissguard> Play smart, Clumbo!
[3:24:56] <%Legato_Ambrose> hah
[3:24:57] <%DXLelouch24> Shinra boxes have mp shards
[3:25:00] <%DXLelouch24> Remember
[3:25:00] <%Dakuu75> how did Pat get into this area? was it jsut unlocked with enough story?
[3:25:01] <%SH1NK1R0> @ape_hawk you can’t use items ever
[3:25:03] <%Engwithan_Elder_God> Fuzzy Wuzzy?
[3:25:03] <@commanderclaw> Wait, I thought it was just no items in battle on hard mode?
[3:25:04] <%mechslayer71> Passive regen plus manage that shit
[3:25:05] <%Aracon_> no but you get a full heal on revive
[3:25:09] <%Keyd00d> No items EVER
[3:25:09] <%barkon345> @patstaresat hard mode has the super bosses in it. would you at least be willing to stream those fights?
[3:25:10] <%VHGS> @commanderclaw no items at all
[3:25:11] <%Tearonex> @PatStaresAt MP restores passively in battle
[3:25:13] <%ShichiNoBushi> MP slowly recovers. Slowly.
[3:25:14] <%ape_hawk> @SH1NK1R0 ah...
[3:25:17] <%Garthunox> @commanderclaw no items period
[3:25:19] <%mechslayer71> @commanderclaw No items ever
[3:25:21] <%baronblank> you regen mp normally during fights and the boxes give mako shards for mp
[3:25:24] <%ScottishMadJacko> Some weapons can boost MP regen
[3:25:27] <%startstoprepeat> slot magnify + an element and mp absorb + the same element and you can cast for like 80% cost
[3:25:31] <%Aydarkzero> on chapter 14 Hard mode just need to have a bit more strategy to your fights
[3:25:32] <%bread_assassin> MP Absorption Materia as well.
[3:25:42] <%DXLelouch24> Revive maxed is required for the final summon and it takes forever to lv
[3:25:44] <%valriot> There is one secret boss in Normal as well with Chadley
[3:25:48] <%Dakuu75> omg, this seems like the WORST weapon for Barret when there are flyers
[3:25:48] <%SGrim> Can Barrett not jump?
[3:25:53] <%logoth_> Is the music borked?
[3:25:55] <%DXLelouch24> Even with ap up
[3:25:57] <%Daxalog> If Berett can go melee. Can Tifa use Ranged?
[3:25:59] <%mechslayer71> @sgrim Nope
[3:26:01] <%Keyd00d> Barret has too much mass to jump
[3:26:05] <%Pyroclase> if you want your MP back, just talk to that one NPC on the Highwind, duh
[3:26:07] <%mechslayer71> @daxalog Nope
[3:26:14] <%Dragon_Batman> Seems that way
[3:26:17] <%baronblank> yep
[3:26:17] <%tigerfang86> it's super good
[3:26:18] <%gatoralus> yes
[3:26:19] <%ScreamLord> yes
[3:26:20] <%Dragon_Batman> Chakra as well
[3:26:20] <%Dakuu75> fucking, everyone doing DMC double jumps in the fight, lol
[3:26:20] <%ScottishMadJacko> Pray and chakra
[3:26:20] <%VHGS> Eh, I didn't use it that much, but it's definitely really good.
[3:26:21] <%broth_elemental> Yes
[3:26:23] <%Keyd00d> I actually haven'tn been using it lmao
[3:26:23] <%SGrim> @mechslayer71 well that seems like a major downside to melee.
[3:26:25] <%Tearonex> Pray and Chakra
[3:26:26] <%Keyd00d> I guess I should
[3:26:26] <%Drowshall> prayer and chakra are must use
[3:26:26] <%valriot> Pray, Steadfast Block are both mandatory basically
[3:26:32] <%tizz86> no phx dwn or ethers
[3:26:36] <%SH1NK1R0> @dxlelouch24 revive isn’t needed at all in the final summon fight outside of safety, what are you talking about.
[3:26:38] <+Story_Ark> Story_Ark subscribed with Twitch Prime. 
[3:26:40] <%DXLelouch24> Yes i prepped TWO maxed prays
[3:26:51] <%valriot> Yeah thats what i did
[3:26:54] <%baronblank> steadfast block isn't mandatory, though I prolly should have used it
[3:26:56] <%GohanHitsugaya> I never use Chakra even though I always have it equipped.
[3:26:56] <%Dragon_Batman> I would too
[3:26:57] <%Metballs> It's balanced around being maxed, yeah
[3:26:59] <%prism_zet> its easier to grind in hard mode
[3:27:03] <%trustycoyote> What carries over into hardmode again?
[3:27:07] <%Felto3> ypu can't max out in advance because you need manuscripts from hard mode
[3:27:10] <%Aracon_> yup
[3:27:14] <%DXLelouch24> @sh1nk1r0 you have to max Revive and all magic materias to unlock final summon
[3:27:18] <%ScottishMadJacko> Everything
[3:27:18] <%ringabal> Cloud must Die mode
[3:27:19] <%valriot> Its actually a SUPER good end game, since it doesnt scale, its just all max level
[3:27:23] <%tizz86> everything
[3:27:24] <%moogleboy1984> they DO, but you can't use any of them
[3:27:26] <%baronblank> everything pretty much carries over
[3:27:26] <%Keyd00d> You have items but you can't use them
[3:27:30] <%tizz86> NG+
[3:27:34] <%Dakuu75> it wouldn't do anything if you equipped two of the same element materia, would it? like two lightning wouldn't make it stronger?
[3:27:35] <%Frostydough1> exp is the same through all difficulties @prism_zet
[3:27:35] <%tizz86> basically
[3:27:35] <%ScottishMadJacko> You just cant ue the itmes
[3:27:36] <%startstoprepeat> literally everything, it's the same save file, you're just chapter selecting hard mode
[3:27:38] <%Tearonex> only your key items arent kept
[3:27:40] <%moogleboy1984> at all
[3:27:41] <%Keyd00d> At ALL
[3:27:41] <%ScottishMadJacko> at all
[3:27:41] <%Aydarkzero> No Items at all
[3:27:41] <%Aracon_> nope no items at all
[3:27:42] <%siamzero94> NO ITEMS
[3:27:42] <%valriot> No at all
[3:27:43] <%코코꾸라> Can't use them at all
[3:27:43] <%CthulhuCommando> can't use items at all
[3:27:43] <%Sir_stride> AT ALL
[3:27:44] <%baronblank> no items

[3:27:46] <%Dragon_Batman> No items from what I see
[3:27:50] <%ape_hawk> so their merch food
[3:27:51] <%valriot> LUL
[3:27:51] <%trustycoyote> Well shit. I'm just gunna level everything then
[3:27:51] <%broth_elemental> At all
[3:27:52] <%Pyroclase> Do you still pick them up?
[3:27:52] <%Nupinoop296> that sucks
[3:27:53] <%Keyd00d> IT'S FOR YOU
[3:27:54] <%Ranryu692> so hard mode is badly designed, then
[3:27:55] <%Aracon_> save scum a lot LUL
[3:27:56] <%Aydarkzero> YEP
[3:27:57] <%Legato_Ambrose> RIGHT?!
[3:27:57] <%VHGS> @Pyroclase yeah lol
[3:27:59] <%Sir_stride> YUP
[3:28:00] <%GohanHitsugaya> That's some bullshit
[3:28:01] <%Engwithan_Elder_God> Sounds hard
[3:28:01] <%baronblank> so use them on normal mode lol
[3:28:02] <%Zulrez> you really need to max out your revive materias
[3:28:02] <%Daxalog> Hit the bench
[3:28:02] <%NitronStreams> GIT GUD
[3:28:02] <%Pyroclase> Oh that's just mean
[3:28:03] <%CelioHogane> USE ITEMS NOW OR THEY WILL GO TO WASTE
[3:28:03] <%Ascethetic> is the party still chapter locked in hard mode?
[3:28:03] <%coreyyotto> YOU HOARDED THOSE ELIXERS FOR NOTHING
[3:28:04] <%trustycoyote> Perfect for you tho!
[3:28:04] <%conradical> yeah it sucks
[3:28:05] <%Tearonex> Yeah, it's HARD mode
[3:28:06] <%Aydarkzero> Bosses get new moves also
[3:28:06] <%Dakuu75> play time go up
[3:28:08] <%Owkono> so dont bother saving them
[3:28:09] <%conradical> no topping off between fights
[3:28:09] <%SH1NK1R0> @dxlelouch24 I know that I beat it all. What I’m saying is that there isn’t any mechanic that requires it in the final summon fight
[3:28:09] <%moogleboy1984> and you can't Pray the hurt away out of combat
[3:28:12] <%vivaldiva> GIT GUD, KUPO
[3:28:13] <%Sir_stride> AND THE BENCH DOESN'T REFILL
[3:28:14] <%TurtlesAndTentacles> fuck that
[3:28:15] <%hardcore_violence> Just play hard mode on easy
[3:28:15] <%Tearonex> It's fun as hell
[3:28:16] <%gatoralus> nomura is giggling
[3:28:17] <%Pyroclase> You can get elixirs but never use them, that's hilarious
[3:28:19] <%Aracon_> basically all those elixirs you're stockpiling need to be used now
[3:28:20] <%Keyd00d> Yeah some bosses do new things
[3:28:23] <%valriot> MP Up and MP Regen skills and passives are VERY good as well
[3:28:23] <%Nupinoop296> that doesn't sound fun at all...
[3:28:25] <%siamzero94> @PatStaresAt Get Götterdämmerung asap in Hard Mode
[3:28:25] <%Dakuu75> @hardcore_violence lol
[3:28:28] <%cylish> Im about halfway through hardmode, the fights seem balanced around doing the mechanics more than how hard you hit
[3:28:28] <%Verd_254> Game just made the "but what if you need them later" decision for you.
[3:28:29] <%cvp5127> might as well use elixirs then
[3:28:30] <%prism_zet> @Frostydough1 yeah but i ende dup at like lvl42 by endgame reg, getting to 50 isn't bad, th eap and stuff is amajor boost to the grind
[3:28:30] <%DXLelouch24> @patstaresat you need all Magic Materia maxed for the final summon, and revive takes forever
[3:28:31] <%Keyd00d> It's more fun than it sounds
[3:28:44] <%mechslayer71> @ranryu692 Nope, I’ve been playing through it, you just gotta git gud, it’s totally manageable
[3:28:45] <%moogleboy1984> German for "God Damned It"
[3:28:47] <%barkon345> so how do you get your MP back in hard mode?
[3:28:49] <%Pyroclase> It's a german word for... oh yeah that
[3:28:49] <%Keyd00d> yeah
[3:28:49] <%Aydarkzero> yes
[3:28:50] <%ScottishMadJacko> aye
[3:28:51] <%Legato_Ambrose> You keep everything
[3:28:56] <%cylish> yeah you keep everything
[3:28:56] <%siamzero94> @PatStaresAt Instant LIMIT BREAK and constant regen on LB
[3:28:56] <%ringabal> Weapons, Skills, and MAteria
[3:29:02] <%Keyd00d> You can break boxes for MP, and it naturally refills
[3:29:04] <%cylish> you just chapter select and choose hardmode
[3:29:05] <%LittleBigQuebec> hard mode is literally ng+ only
[3:29:06] <%Pyroclase> That's what they called the giant doom battleship in Iron Sky!
[3:29:07] <%broth_elemental> Its certainly challenging
[3:29:08] <%hardcore_violence> nah you have to fight barehanded. barret just has a stump
[3:29:09] <%Felto3> you get MP back by completing a chapter
[3:29:10] <%Metballs> MP back from boxes, skills, and just waiting
[3:29:21] <%Legato_Ambrose> waiting?
[3:29:24] <%Ranryu692> so the game is either so easy it's a joke on normal, or don't use magic because you'll never get your mp back on hard? what amazing game design
[3:29:27] <%Metballs> There's a passive MP regen
[3:29:32] <%Legato_Ambrose> Oh shit
[3:29:36] <%Aydarkzero> MP recharges slowly in mid fight
[3:29:38] <%Legato_Ambrose> I may actually go back to it then
[3:29:40] <%Metballs> It's super slow, but there
[3:29:42] <%Pyroclase> oh yeah the music is back
[3:29:51] <%coreyyotto> There's no MP regen on hard
[3:29:51] <%Aracon_> now you have to continue the plot to advance this quest
[3:29:54] <%Keyd00d> Game design is fine, you just need to adapt
[3:29:56] <%prism_zet> time for story qquest
[3:29:57] <%VHGS> @Ranryu692 I had MP issues literally zero times playing through on hard. It's fine.
[3:30:01] <%Verd_254> SourPls
[3:30:01] <%Dragon_Batman> Da sewers?
[3:30:06] <%Pyroclase> you need the emerald, diamond, and ruby tiaras to open the library up
[3:30:07] <%mechslayer71> @ranryu692 1) MP regenerates passively 2) it comes back between chapters. Great analysis
[3:30:07] <%DXLelouch24> Theres two secret bosses and ones an old friend from Og ff7
[3:30:08] <%Tearonex> time for more plot
[3:30:09] <%Tiewolf> that remix
[3:30:12] <%Dakuu75> so, every time cloud has to crouch walk under rubble, it's jsut to give the game time to load right? will that still be there in the PC version?
[3:30:13] <%Movemeister> SourPls
[3:30:19] <%tigerfang86> @Ranryu692 did you miss the part where pat was having a rough fight against a sidequest behemoth
[3:30:19] <%valriot> Its less being fucked for MP, and more like play smart. SMT style
[3:30:26] <%ape_hawk> you can advance story and still go back for coliseum, btw
[3:30:38] <%ape_hawk> you will be notified of the point of no return
[3:30:40] <%Aydarkzero> when i started NG+ Hard Cloud had like 150MP already
[3:30:47] <%Dragon_Batman> LUL
[3:30:51] <%GohanHitsugaya> Those things really love you
[3:30:52] <%Ranryu692> @tigerfang86 yes, I haven't been watching because of my own playthrough, but I'm further than him and haven't been challenged yet
[3:30:53] <%코코꾸라> IT COUNTED
[3:30:54] <%tigerfang86> STOP BEING SO COOL
[3:30:55] <%Metballs> It's really clear when you need to stop story progression
[3:30:58] <%SH1NK1R0> @coreyyotto yes there is. In combat you regen mp passively and this can be boasted by some weapon passives. Also mako shards in boxes give it back. And you will always start a new chapter topped off.
[3:31:01] <%Legato_Ambrose> "Stop being so strong at these early game monsters!"
[3:31:19] <%Dakuu75> where's an FFXIV level Sync when you need it
[3:31:34] <%ringabal> HP
[3:31:35] <%ChaosAethr> ATK
[3:31:35] <%Metballs> Attack
[3:31:37] <%siamzero94> POWER
[3:31:39] <%Ascethetic> hp
[3:31:39] <%DXLelouch24> Pats complaining about big number? What timeline is this?
[3:31:39] <%prism_zet> atk
[3:31:40] <%Dakuu75> HP
[3:31:40] <%Metballs> Always big number strong go up
[3:31:40] <%Dragon_Batman> For Barret maybe HP
[3:31:41] <%coreyyotto> @SH1NK1R0 You regen passively on Normal but on hard you don't according to every guide I've seen
[3:31:48] <%broth_elemental> Atkatk
[3:31:49] <%ScreamLord> @PatStaresAt Why not both?
[3:31:53] <%cvp5127> hp
[3:31:54] <%Legato_Ambrose> BArret Atk
[3:31:56] <%valriot> Some of the weapon passives are a lot better in Hard as well, like MP return on taking damage
[3:31:56] <cumurasame> cumurasame subscribed at Tier 1. 
[3:31:59] <%Keyd00d> You regen on hard too
[3:32:02] <%Owkono> big number
[3:32:02] <%Dragon_Batman> If you can both yea
[3:32:02] <%Scarnehu> what's mr hp
[3:32:04] <%ringabal> UGH SETTLING
[3:32:06] <%NitronStreams> por que no los dos
[3:32:07] <%Legato_Ambrose> Barret is range, shouldn't need high hp
[3:32:15] <%mechslayer71> @coreyyotto not from what I’ve noticed playing, mine still comes back
[3:32:20] <%DXLelouch24> Barrets the tank are you high?
[3:32:21] <%JD_Lars> Attack
[3:32:21] <%SH1NK1R0> @coreyyotto the guides you read are literally incorrect as I’ve beaten the whole game on hard and all the super bosses. Sorry.
[3:32:25] <%Dragon_Batman> Lifesaver can be helpful
[3:32:28] <%DXLelouch24> Yes he does need hp
[3:32:28] <%Keyd00d> CLEAR
[3:32:33] <%Mornaka> clear
[3:32:33] <%Treuan> Everclear more like
[3:32:34] <%coreyyotto> I guess that's good news then.
[3:32:35] <%ringabal> @PatStaresAt So you know, the third door can only be found if you progress
[3:32:36] <%Keyd00d> You gotta progress the story now
[3:32:41] <%valriot> @PatStaresAt Yeah you need to progress story for last one
[3:32:43] <%Scarnehu> hp so you can use barretts damage absorber
[3:32:44] <%Dwarven_Gaming> time for MSQ
[3:32:45] <%Sir_stride> you gotta progress now
[3:32:48] <%CelioHogane> @Keyd00d nah, colloseum

[3:33:01] <%Cn_alpha_02> Last is in story quest
[3:33:01] <%Sir_stride> ahhh

[3:33:06] <%valriot> You can go back to arena after

[3:33:20] <%prism_zet> yes
[3:33:21] <%cowardman93> yeah
[3:33:22] <%gatoralus> you can go back to the arena after sewers
[3:33:22] <%Sir_stride> yes
[3:33:22] <%Keyd00d> Yeah as longa s you don't start climbing

[3:33:29] <%코코꾸라> or you could go after
[3:33:30] <%ShichiNoBushi> But arena now.
[3:33:33] <%siamzero94> The game tells you when hard progess is being made
[3:33:36] <%prism_zet> did you buy all moogle stuff?\
[3:33:37] <%AllenDeadman> yes, but wnot now?
[3:33:40] <%rytyoung> You're better going now
[3:33:40] <%valriot> Yeah the game tells you "hey fucker, cant go back" when you get to that point
[3:33:40] <%NitronStreams> NUMBER GO UP
[3:33:41] <%Keyd00d> I'll call now Kappa
[3:33:46] <%Legato_Ambrose> Oh boy does the game tell you when hard progress is being made
[3:33:52] <%conradical> what's left at the arena?
[3:33:52] <%DXLelouch24> The game will tell you when its the point of no return
[3:33:53] <%Dakuu75> I forgot about the moogle-medal crap
[3:33:57] <%Dragon_Batman> Do it now it's not that bad
[3:33:57] <%siamzero94> ok then
[3:33:58] <%cowardman93> there's an explicit moment it will ask if you're ready to start the stretch to the end
[3:33:59] <%YakumoYomi> The game will tell you when you get close to the POINT OF NO RETURN
[3:34:00] <%AllenDeadman> you could go now indeed
[3:34:04] <%rytyoung> @legato_ambrose yeah it does
[3:34:07] <%ape_hawk> hey madame m is cool

[3:34:39] <%cumurasame> @PatStaresAt Hye Pat, quick question, how do you feel about Chrono Cross
[3:34:43] <%ChaosAethr> cash the Metals for stuff if you need anything from the kid
[3:34:49] <%CelioHogane> This one, no?
[3:34:50] <%DXLelouch24> Feels like FF and Yakuza had a baby to be honest

[3:35:03] <%Aydarkzero> just farm arenas and set it to easy fights
[3:35:04] <%Legato_Ambrose> Seriously it'll ask you like three times "Are you SUUUURE you wanna do this? There's PROBABLY NO TURNING BACK"
[3:35:05] <%valriot> Not 16, who the fuck said 16 LUL

[3:35:42] <%BubbaRands> LUL
[3:35:43] <%SH1NK1R0> To be completely honest grinding for ap was never necessary as you will max all but the revive materia in like 2 chapters
[3:35:43] <%TehMud> LUL
[3:35:44] <%Engwithan_Elder_God> Barrett's looking smaller.
[3:35:45] <%narusao> FailFish

[3:35:58] <%BallerSwagBro9k> SourPls
[3:35:59] <%RAAAAAINMAKER> Depends on how fast you can beat a specific 3 person battle challenge

[3:36:27] <@commanderclaw> I'd shower with Tifa
[3:36:35] <%Legato_Ambrose> You killed all his pets!
[3:36:36] <%YakumoYomi> To be fair: getting hit by fire fills up my death gauge
[3:36:37] <%siamzero94> oh my god
[3:36:39] <%Keyd00d> how many times do we have to teach you this lesson black majima
[3:36:40] <%Tearonex> that juggle
[3:36:43] <%DXLelouch24> You can also just switch to easy while grinding since i beat it already

[3:39:21] <%ape_hawk> i cant wait until the normal mode speedrun of this game
[3:39:25] <%tiaramaki> @moogleboy1984 Okay, so I wasn't the only one who thought that
[3:39:26] <%NitronStreams> those masks totally looked like beards
[3:39:29] <%Dwarven_Gaming> OI it said you ant steal
[3:39:34] <%Dwarven_Gaming> thats BS
[3:39:37] <%valriot> Honestly dont get gil in this game, theres barely anything to buy anyway
[3:40:00] <%moogleboy1984> @tiaramaki he needs to either growl "Police Girl" or call Serph a moron
[3:40:03] <%TimetodiveLTX> the camera angle Pog
[3:40:06] <%TehMud> enbScam
[3:40:17] <%ape_hawk> guys, i think tifa wants a shower, she keeps saying it every five minutes
[3:40:31] <%prism_zet> @ape_hawk pat won't let her, he likes it better
[3:40:35] <%Legato_Ambrose> It's cause how SWEAT she gets
[3:40:37] <%tiaramaki> @moogleboy1984 Or angst about being a lone, or get annoyed at Haruhi LUL
[3:40:38] <%valriot> sweaty tifas
[3:40:43] <%tiaramaki> *clone
[3:40:47] <%GohanHitsugaya> Clearly she wants to take a shower with Clumbo.
[3:40:48] <%Legato_Ambrose> The player must know how SWEATY TIFA IS
[3:40:48] <%ringabal> It keeps the gloves moist
[3:40:54] <%narusao> LUL
[3:40:54] <%Dragon_Batman> Leviathan still needs to be conquered right?
[3:40:55] <%Engwithan_Elder_God> boooooooooo
[3:40:58] <%Scarnehu> weapon up
[3:40:58] <%narusao> nailed it
[3:40:58] <%Pyroclase> is that a nebwerfer??
[3:41:01] <%Mornaka> She gets sweaty on her under-tiffers
[3:41:02] <%moogleboy1984> don't quit your day job
[3:41:03] <%AllenDeadman> psaBig funny
[3:41:09] <%ape_hawk> pat, wheres the third hand for patting your own back? i dont see it
[3:41:23] <%lockhead45> !uptime
[3:41:23] <@Moobot> I've been playing this game for how long? Oh only 3h 41m.
[3:41:34] <%DXLelouch24> Does Cloud know who the final summon is?
[3:41:35] <%Story_Ark> that was a SAD joke honhonhon
[3:41:40] <%DXLelouch24> I mean Pat
[3:41:43] <%BallerSwagBro9k> Oh man I cant wait the sequels and Ruby Weapon
[3:41:44] <%Legato_Ambrose> No
[3:41:46] <%DXLelouch24> Damn im tired
[3:41:51] <%DXLelouch24> I blame Max
[3:42:13] <%Dakuu75> I can't believe max is streaming right now. didn't he end his stream at like 4 am?
[3:42:14] <%Metballs> Is there proof that Cloud isn't actually Pat?
[3:42:25] <%Dragon_Batman> Baldness?
[3:42:27] <%DXLelouch24> @dakuu75 try 6am
[3:42:28] <%Legato_Ambrose> Eat-Sleep-Stream
[3:42:32] <%GohanHitsugaya> Hm, i think it needs more Materia...
[3:42:41] <%doc_ock_rokc> @Metballs Height, Hair, weight
[3:42:45] <%DXLelouch24> And he was still streaming when i went to bed
[3:42:56] <%Dakuu75> jesus lol
[3:42:59] <%siamzero94> @Metballs Cloud has Mind-Orcs not Mind-Goblins
[3:43:12] <%doc_ock_rokc> WWWWAAAGGGGHHHH
[3:43:17] <%DXLelouch24> @metballs the fact Paige is too squishy to be Tifa?
[3:43:18] <%RAAAAAINMAKER> Materia slots > Stats
[3:43:21] <%weissguard> Max is probably riding an FF7R related Energy High.
[3:43:39] <%NitronStreams> way to go clumbo
[3:43:40] <%doc_ock_rokc> @DXLelouch24 Paige is Aerith
[3:43:53] <%DXLelouch24> @doc_ock_rokc well thats dire
[3:44:07] <%Aydarkzero> Cloud All Rounder is the best
[3:44:09] <%Legato_Ambrose> It is
[3:44:11] <%tizz86> that's what he's ment to be
[3:44:12] <%AllenDeadman> it is
[3:44:18] <%CelioHogane> How is it useless?
[3:44:18] <%moogleboy1984> noobtrap
[3:44:19] <%Pyroclase> is there a finite amount of gil in the game?
[3:44:20] <%Legato_Ambrose> Big pointless
[3:44:22] <%siamzero94> yeah 5% is kinda meh
[3:44:42] <%Metballs> And LB is pretty infrequent
[3:44:42] <%DXLelouch24> You can reset for 100gil so it doesnt matter
[3:44:45] <%GohanHitsugaya> Plus you get it so rarely it doesn't really matter...
[3:44:45] <%CelioHogane> I mean, the way you use it, yeah
[3:44:54] <%Nope80808> @Pyroclase nah
[3:44:58] <%Dragon_Batman> Experimenting isn't so bad
[3:45:29] <%SH1NK1R0> There are enough points for every skill and the item for the challenge bosses lets you start every battle with limit
[3:45:38] <%YakumoYomi> There's that accessory that increases the Limit gauge when you use MP, but I'm not sure how useful it is to use Limit Breaks more often
[3:45:47] <%DXLelouch24> Wondering if i should tackle the secret bosses before hard mode run or wait till later in run
[3:46:23] <%DXLelouch24> I want my weapon lv 6 tho
[3:46:29] <%Dakuu75> can't believe it's only 100 gil to reset. that's so nice
[3:46:32] <%optimasmaximas> @dxlelouch24 oh shot secret bosses in this game?
[3:46:41] <%moogleboy1984> It's for when you want that 300% stagger acheivement
[3:46:42] <%prism_zet> there's a few
[3:46:44] <%broth_elemental> @DXLelouch24 most optional bosses are locked in Hard anyway
[3:46:45] <%baronblank> I'd say tackle them after since hard mode run since you get scripts for making weapons better from doing hard mode
[3:47:05] <%DXLelouch24> @broth_elemental you can select em on normal but it autos to hard in sim
[3:47:09] <%prism_zet> I got 300% stagger with the tifa solo vr missions
[3:47:20] <%Dragon_Batman> Good to know
[3:47:33] <%Dragon_Batman> I was wondering where or how
[3:47:33] <%ape_hawk> fuck
[3:47:35] <%SH1NK1R0> @dxlelouch24 I went through hard in order then did the special fights when I got to the chapter. By then I had all maxed characters with maxed weapons and better materia. You can definitely try for it as the item makes hard easier but doing it early is harder as a result
[3:47:35] <%Keyd00d> Y'know that sentry gun thug
[3:47:36] <%tizz86> i did chp 1-8 on hard with materia up equipped and made serious bank
[3:47:40] <%Pyroclase> I want to imagine they just lured these guys here and they have no idea why they're fighting
[3:47:41] <%valriot> Triple Slash is so busted LUL
[3:47:45] <%Legato_Ambrose> We gettin' close to end of stream now that he's hittin' colusseum?
[3:47:50] <%TallYoda08> psaBig psaFist
[3:48:05] <%moogleboy1984> I did Chi, triangle, chi, triangle, refocus, triangle, triangle chi, triangle etc
[3:48:05] <%Metballs> He just ran out of things to do, Legato
[3:48:06] <%prism_zet> you can get 300% stagger with fat chocobo fight too
[3:48:09] <%Metballs> So maybe not
[3:48:10] <%rumtumtugnutz> can we just discus how there's no way the Wall /market would be working like it is after a big piece of Midgar fell on the Slums?
[3:48:10] <%Felto3> just beat hellhouse hard mode and HOLY FUCK what a fight
[3:48:10] <%tizz86> gil up i ment
[3:48:17] <%Dragon_Batman> Sweet

[3:48:22] <%NitronStreams> murder
[3:48:27] <%rufus2k2> you can ignite their backpacks?!
[3:48:29] <%Pyroclase> damn, he got styled on
[3:48:32] <%Legato_Ambrose> Got it
[3:48:35] <%Spiralpower1620> Hades? cmonBruh
[3:48:37] <%rufus2k2> oh these dudes
[3:48:38] <%Dragon_Batman> Thanks for the heads up Prism
[3:48:45] <%DXLelouch24> Gils useless in hard mode tho other than extra materia
[3:48:55] <%CelioHogane> What's with this DMC5 music
[3:48:58] <%Legato_Ambrose> "Hold on, before we start this next match we gotta bolt these sentry guns into this dirt floor"
[3:48:58] <%doc_ock_rokc> What is this DMC MUSIC
[3:49:02] <%FusRoDom> This music is straight outta DMC
[3:49:02] <%tiaramaki> Just Desserts is such a raw track
[3:49:11] <%moogleboy1984> BRAVE DON'T FEAR GRAVE
[3:49:15] <%rytyoung> THE DARKNESS OF NIGHT FALL SURROUNDS MY SOUL
[3:49:17] <%rufus2k2> man this ost is insane
[3:49:23] <%Aydarkzero> Quad Slash When Kappa
[3:49:24] <%Dragon_Batman> LUL
[3:49:27] <%CelioHogane> Don't question it
[3:49:27] <%doc_ock_rokc> Useless cause is breaking your back
[3:49:27] <%코코꾸라> Triple Slash
[3:49:28] <%Aracon_> LUL
[3:49:28] <%AllenDeadman> LUL
[3:49:29] <%ape_hawk> triple strike one hit him
[3:49:30] <%cvp5127> shhhh

[3:49:32] <%ringabal> Time Ghosts
[3:49:35] <%CelioHogane> HE GOT SCARED TO DEATH
[3:49:35] <%Keyd00d> triple strike is busted
[3:49:36] <%Pyroclase> The sword is just that big
[3:49:38] <%Aracon_> too strong
[3:49:40] <%tizz86> @dxlelouch24 i learned that lol. gil is largely useless in the entire game since everything is found or given
[3:49:41] <%TimetodiveLTX> BLESS ME WITH YOUR GIFT OF LIIIGHT-AAH
[3:49:42] <%siamzero94> triple strike is just that good
[3:49:42] <%valriot> Triple is fucked up, its ridiculously strong
[3:49:55] <%Spiralpower1620> Use Royal Guard SwiftRage
[3:49:57] <%GohanHitsugaya> lol
[3:49:58] <%heartlesshealer> LUL
[3:49:59] <%AllenDeadman> FRIED
[3:50:11] <%NitronStreams> Wheres the style meter?
[3:50:12] <%ScreamLord> Finger of God holy shit
[3:50:24] <%doc_ock_rokc> This is more FF
[3:50:36] <%ape_hawk> hey, he successfully landed a blade burst-o
[3:50:37] <%siamzero94> summon? pff we don't need that in this house
[3:50:38] <%Dakuu75> "summon" lol why?
[3:50:39] <%코코꾸라> Good job!
[3:50:48] <%DXLelouch24> He doesnt have Royal Guard
[3:50:49] <%rufus2k2> I'M A MEMBER OF SOLDIER
[3:50:51] <%DXLelouch24> Yet
[3:50:51] <%doc_ock_rokc> @ScreamLord Finger of God refers to F5 Tornados
[3:50:54] <%heartlesshealer> CLOUD BOOK GET
[3:51:01] <%rufus2k2> WAIT
[3:51:03] <%Treuan> Cloud is reading books about playing with his sword
[3:51:08] <%ape_hawk> yeah
[3:51:09] <%Aydarkzero> yep
[3:51:09] <%Legato_Ambrose> Yeeeaaaah
[3:51:10] <%CelioHogane> Yes

[3:51:14] <%valriot> No theyre new ones, Cloud is just fuckin strong
[3:51:16] <%Buzzard42> yes
[3:51:19] <%rytyoung> ye
[3:51:22] <%heartlesshealer> You didn't notice with all the "Vs. Beasts" fights?
[3:51:23] <%NitronStreams> like at dis cannon fodder
[3:51:23] <%GohanHitsugaya> Noice
[3:51:25] <%ScreamLord> @doc_ock_rokc I thought that was just some bullshit Twister made up?
[3:51:26] <%AllenDeadman> jesus
[3:51:28] <%ringabal> GUNSLINGER
[3:51:28] <%rufus2k2> god he barely he has to move
[3:51:29] <%Pyroclase> I love that Barret can perform gun combos
[3:51:29] <%Caped_Eggy> Audiences dead
[3:51:30] <%Buzzard42> SourPls
[3:51:36] <%TallYoda08> Wow
[3:51:38] <%Pyroclase> ranged weapon combos are my favorite thing
[3:51:38] <%siamzero94> jesus barret stop shooting the audience
[3:51:47] <%doc_ock_rokc> @ScreamLord its the South we got a ton of nicknames for shit
[3:51:51] <%Daxalog> Is Barett just your highest damage dealer?
[3:51:51] <%Spiralpower1620> So it’s the same except it’s not as fun to watch
[3:52:25] <%doc_ock_rokc> Cloud is
[3:52:32] <%barkon345> he is the tank
[3:52:35] <%BubbaRands> TANK/HEALER
[3:52:37] <%Pyroclase> I would not expect a ranged character to ever be best at damage
[3:52:38] <%NitronStreams> dmc music time again
[3:52:41] <%TallYoda08> psaBig psaDab
[3:52:41] <%SH1NK1R0> Why does no one use iron skin it’s literally his best move
[3:52:45] <%DXLelouch24> @daxalog endgame Aerith wipes things out of existance
[3:52:55] <%valriot> He does great stragger and cripple damage on top of being a T A N K
[3:52:56] <%barkon345> is barret the first ever ranged tank?
[3:52:58] <%mechslayer71> @sh1nk1r0 He does, there’s just no point here
[3:53:02] <%doc_ock_rokc> Usless cause is breaking your back. Your life will end when you attack
[3:53:09] <%YakumoYomi> @Pyroclase Does Spread 3 HBG in Monster Hunter World count?
[3:53:12] <%Dakuu75> @barkon345 I guess so, eh.
[3:53:22] <%rufus2k2> Wakka
[3:53:25] <%doc_ock_rokc> HEAVY WEAPONS GUY
[3:53:29] <%Keyd00d> We need a class just called Barret in XIV
[3:53:29] <%SH1NK1R0> @mechslayer71 really cause I see him get knocked out of every other attack
[3:53:33] <%cylish> I mean, arnt tanks ranged? like real ones?
[3:53:36] <%Brickston> Barret's a lot more fun than Aerith as a ranged fighter
[3:53:39] <%GohanHitsugaya> Pat, hit the triangle button when Barret reloads his gun
[3:53:39] <%KasiCrafter> Aren't all IRL tanks ranged?
[3:53:40] <%ape_hawk> is barret the first black guy?
[3:53:41] <%SolidusRex> Heavy Weapons Guy
[3:53:46] <%DXLelouch24> No Yuffies an evasion tank
[3:53:48] <@SoFarFetched> Was beaten to it LUL
[3:53:53] <%Spiralpower1620> Barrett is just going to bust a cap in yo ass
[3:53:53] <%Futurecity10> The next ff14 tank class is literally a gunhand
[3:53:55] <%mechslayer71> @sh1nk1r0 I mean challenge wise. He’s crushing these guys like they’re nothing
[3:53:56] <%heartlesshealer> LUL
[3:53:58] <%rumtumtugnutz> Less of a tank and more of a mobile artillery platform
[3:54:05] <%heartlesshealer> Riot shields ain't shit to Barret
[3:54:08] <%ringabal> For his Neutral Special, he wields a GUN
[3:54:09] <%Dakuu75> evasion tanks aren't REAL tanks
[3:54:10] <%rufus2k2> RiNOT shield mebbe
[3:54:14] <%RAAAAAINMAKER> Barret with max luck boost and a elemental crit melts bosses
[3:54:20] <%barkon345> im just used to tanks getting in the face of enimies to draw agro
[3:54:29] <%Spiralpower1620> Has there ever been a Support Tank?
[3:54:34] <%doc_ock_rokc> @Dakuu75 Tell that to germany
[3:54:34] <%Brickston> @RAAAAAINMAKER throw on magnify+barrier and that's basically unstoppable
[3:54:47] <%CelioHogane> Well i mean you oneshotted it with Thundaga...
[3:54:49] <%siamzero94> but cloud has magic
[3:54:52] <%Aracon_> max fury is a dps monster
[3:54:56] <%ALazo> barret can be a real monster if you build him right. Being able to do good damage from afar with the normal attack is also crazy.
[3:54:56] <%barkon345> @Spiralpower1620 inst that just a paladine?
[3:54:59] <%Brickston> Also pray, always pray
[3:55:02] <%valriot> Barrett with 3 ATB is super good, he has better use of it
[3:55:06] <%Spiralpower1620> IDK
[3:55:19] <%Brickston> yeah valriot and he builds ATB like mad
[3:55:25] <%heartlesshealer> probably chakra
[3:55:29] <%CelioHogane> Barret seems the funnier to play
[3:55:35] <%Taglog7> I wanna hertz donut
[3:55:36] <%DXLelouch24> Nah Tifa
[3:55:39] <%DXLelouch24> Do combo
[3:55:44] <%AllenDeadman> two tanks shooting eachother
[3:55:47] <%Dakuu75> lol steel skin AND barrier on Barret, that's some OP shit
[3:55:56] <%CelioHogane> If FF7 had Online coop in PC, i would play as him.
[3:56:01] <%Spiralpower1620> Tifa is honestly my favorite to play as. I just love brawlers
[3:56:01] <%Brickston> Tifa's only seems good for increasing stagger damage
[3:56:06] <%DXLelouch24> Especially after you get Purple Pains ability
[3:56:17] <%siamzero94> that thing is barely attacking
[3:56:20] <%DXLelouch24> Then your playing her wrong
[3:56:20] <%CelioHogane> (also ff7 should totally get online coop, like FFXV got)
[3:56:24] <%valriot> Barrett is the only one who does ATB skill that get better the more they drain, so you can drain 3 bars on Max Fury ect
[3:56:25] <%Aracon_> tifa is really good at pouring on damage if you equip her right
[3:56:31] <%NitronStreams> Clap
[3:56:34] <%Daxalog> Its just standing there Menacingly?
[3:56:36] <%GohanHitsugaya> psaUp
[3:56:36] <%Mornaka> @Brickston metal knuckle hits like a freight train at full unleashed power
[3:56:40] <%RAAAAAINMAKER> Tifa can do do a nice quick chunk of damageif you follow the buffing steps
[3:56:44] <%YakumoYomi> Tifa is loads of fun to play as. Unbridled Strength changes her triangle button, she can increase the stagger bonus, and stuff like Chi Trap can CC enemies
[3:56:49] <%cowardman93> man Barret just constantly shit talks in battle
[3:57:01] <%rufus2k2> I hope for FF7r part 2 they record more voice lines for battle that get grandfathered into 1
[3:57:02] <%DXLelouch24> My tifas luck stat is over 100 atm and her two luck materias arent even maxed
[3:57:03] <%siamzero94> oh man poor boys
[3:57:03] <%goose_attack_almanac> THOSE MEN ARE GUNNA DIE HAPPY
[3:57:08] <%Capta1n_H3nry> That was almost like watching Deadpool and Dante shoot each other
[3:57:11] <%valriot> Tifa is honestly kind of lacking until theyre staggered, so youre better putting ATB stagger on her
[3:57:12] <%CelioHogane> @rufus2k2 unlikelly
[3:57:12] <%Spiralpower1620> @cowardman93 Your name is deanGood psaUp LUL
[3:57:13] <%Legato_Ambrose> Death by snu snu
[3:57:17] <%barkon345> @CelioHogane my friend the other day told me some bullshit rumor that not only were they adding co-op to ff7 remake but the next game was going to be an MMO
[3:57:18] <%Aracon_> Like I've got tifa as a glass cannon and she consistently carries me in fights
[3:57:30] <%Engwithan_Elder_God> JESUS
[3:57:36] <%AllenDeadman> dead
[3:57:37] <%CelioHogane> @barkon345 well, i mean, XV coop kinda was
[3:57:37] <%heartlesshealer> Just summon a hit box
[3:57:44] <%Brickston> @valriot definitely, all I ever did when playing as Tifa was spam Starshot+Overpower
[3:57:48] <%Legato_Ambrose> Punch so hard it makes a black hole
[3:57:48] <%PanicSwytch> I usually don't like brawler/monk characters in FF but I like how they made Tifa's gameplay
[3:57:56] <%DXLelouch24> @barkon345 yea thats not happenin
[3:58:14] <%Brickston> Oh yeah, Tifa has an amazing Parry, way better than anyone else's
[3:58:23] <%Dragon_Batman> Her natural speedy movement helps me in getting out of danger alot
[3:58:26] <%Brickston> extremely extremely useful for her
[3:58:32] <%Dakuu75> Tifa always "I'd kill for a shower" she must have some STANK pits... or it's all under-boob sweat.
[3:58:32] <%Legato_Ambrose> SWEAT
[3:58:34] <%heartlesshealer> good luck when you get to the sweeper
[3:58:36] <%CelioHogane> @PanicSwytch she is just Dante Ballrog but with speed instead of damage
[3:58:42] <%valriot> And then Aerith is just broken strong LUL
[3:58:46] <%NitronStreams> My chosen torture makes me stronger
[3:58:58] <%NitronStreams> In a life that craves the hunger
[3:59:07] <%DXLelouch24> Aerith is cast a spell and everything dies
[3:59:11] <%NitronStreams> A Freedom and a quest for life
[3:59:14] <%Metballs> I can see the throughline to that MMO point: Yoshi from XIV is in charge of another project that MIGHT be XVI. But there's no guarantee it is the next mainline game, there's no guarantee it's even online, and it's certainly not VIIR-2

[3:59:18] <%NitronStreams> Until the end the judgment night
[3:59:18] <%Aracon_> fucking love starshower
[3:59:20] <%코코꾸라> Starshower is SO COOL
[3:59:21] <%Quigsies> Starshower is so good
[3:59:21] <%tiaramaki> psaDab
[3:59:23] <%rytyoung> DICK PUNCH
[3:59:31] <%Brickston> Starshower is pretty boss
[3:59:42] <%Aracon_> she's borderline invincible during it, does massive damage, and it buffs the next ability
[3:59:48] <%cowardman93> all of her moves are great
[3:59:53] <%VHGS> If an enemy can be interrupted chi trap might as well do a million damage to them.
[4:00:09] <%Treuan> Typical monk
[4:00:16] <%AllenDeadman> MNK problems LUL
[4:00:17] <%cowardman93> I want her to have DMC style button inputs to give her full potential
[4:00:24] <%Dakuu75> lol
[4:00:28] <%RAAAAAINMAKER> She makes me want to get good at Tekken
[4:00:47] <%GohanHitsugaya> Noice
[4:00:49] <%AllenDeadman> she makes me want to ask harada for shit... in particular to put her in the game
[4:00:56] <%goose_attack_almanac> she makes me want to be a better man
[4:01:03] <%Dakuu75> if you slow it down during that maximum-spider looking attack, is her model disapearing?
[4:01:05] <%Quigsies> God, makes me wish for a good Dissidia game
[4:01:22] <%Pyroclase> Why did it shoot at the sky?
[4:01:26] <%Keyd00d> them combos
[4:01:27] <%heartlesshealer> good job
[4:01:32] <%Aracon_> @Quigsies :(
[4:01:40] <%heartlesshealer> >:
[4:01:42] <%LaughingCatt> well now Im sad
[4:01:43] <%LandOfTheWay> BOY WOULD IT
[4:01:44] <%AllenDeadman> FeelsBadMan
[4:01:45] <%moogleboy1984> I kind of want a single player FFXIV in this style
[4:01:46] <%cowardman93> hell all the characters control great, it makes me real hopeful for the future characters
[4:01:47] <%rufus2k2> Imagine making a FF fighting game and not putting in Sabin or Zell
[4:01:47] <%CelioHogane> Just make Dissidia but with this game's gameplay
[4:01:48] <%Maids4lyfe> FeelsBadMan
[4:01:48] <%BubbaRands> You did get one...on psp Kappa
[4:01:48] <%RAAAAAINMAKER> NOW WE'RE ALL SAD
[4:01:49] <%Keyd00d> FeelsBadMan
[4:01:49] <%akaAxi0m> Just put Tifa in Tekken
[4:01:49] <%valriot> Yeah, call it Not Dissidia
[4:01:51] <%YakumoYomi> @Quigsies I'd say the first two were good, but not NT. They went way to hard on the 3v3 format
[4:01:51] <%tiaramaki> I miss Duodecim BibleThump
[4:01:53] <%LordSDB> Would have to get a psp mate :c
[4:01:55] <%Dragon_Batman> Yeaa, the new one isn't terrible but oh boy is it not great
[4:01:56] <%rufus2k2> like the disrespect
[4:01:58] <%baronblank> maaan
[4:02:03] <%JohnAtDawn> Don't need to make one, just port it to ps4
[4:02:06] <%ringabal> It was either this or the pachinko hell
[4:02:07] <%superchronicc> ive never played the dissidia games, but i heard how good the first one was from friends years ago
[4:02:07] <%baronblank> new dissidia like the old ones would be so good
[4:02:12] <%Futurecity10> I hope bahamuts in this game
[4:02:19] <%Sir_stride> this games sound track is so fucking good. im sorry doom, youve been outdone
[4:02:22] <%Quigsies> @YakumoYomi Oh yeah, both of the PSP ones are great, just wish we had a good modern one lol
[4:02:23] <%GohanHitsugaya> He is
[4:02:23] <%코코꾸라> The first Dissidia and 012 were amazing
[4:02:28] <%Daxalog> is the 2nd dssidia game good?
[4:02:32] <%Taglog7> how about disgaea
[4:02:33] <%Spiralpower1620> When’s Bahamut hearts 3 SwiftRage
[4:02:35] <%Aracon_> just remake duodecim and I'll honestly be happy
[4:02:37] <%KawaiiJetty> I'm still loving the 1st Dissidia game. So memorable
[4:02:38] <%superstarsage> Isn't dissidia NT an arcade port?
[4:02:43] <%Dragon_Batman> I only played 012 on emu and it was great
[4:02:45] <%AllenDeadman> yes
[4:02:47] <%AllenDeadman> yes it is
[4:02:49] <%SH1NK1R0> @futurecity10 well......you see.....
[4:02:54] <%maenos2> Geez i read dissidia as disgaea
[4:02:54] <%tiaramaki> @daxalog Duodecim is GREAT
[4:02:55] <%superchronicc> did the dissida titles get ported from the psp at some point?
[4:02:56] <%valriot> Use Raise
[4:02:58] <%LordSDB> yes Dissia 2 is good @Daxalog improves the combat, bigger rooster
[4:02:58] <%Felto3> 2nd dissidia is basiccally the GOTY edition for original
[4:02:58] <%Aracon_> especially considering duodecim has like the entire 1st game's story integrated into it
[4:03:03] <%DXLelouch24> Dissidia is in this game in a wat
[4:03:04] <%Pyroclase> Wait, how did they get GHOSTS into the arena?
[4:03:05] <%DXLelouch24> Hehe
[4:03:07] <%croxeye> lets be real tho, Dissidia always paled compared to Ehrgeiz LUL
[4:03:11] <%DXLelouch24> Way*
[4:03:21] <%barkon345> which game do you guys think has the better soundtrack this or Neir Automata?
[4:03:28] <%Legato_Ambrose> We need a new Ehrgeiz...
[4:03:28] <%Keyd00d> Nier
[4:03:28] <%mechslayer71> @pyroclase Sshhhh
[4:03:29] <%코코꾸라> @superchronicc sadly, they weren't. But PSP emulation is pretty good
[4:03:31] <%maenos2> Nier
[4:03:35] <%Spiralpower1620> When’s “The Bouncer” Remake? SwiftRage slySmug
[4:03:36] <%코코꾸라> FF7R @barkon345
[4:03:39] <%Legato_Ambrose> NO
[4:03:40] <%mechslayer71> @barkon345 honestly, I think this.
[4:03:40] <%Movemeister> Nier
[4:03:41] <%Legato_Ambrose> YOU
[4:03:42] <%KawaiiJetty> Both
[4:03:42] <%croxeye> LUL
[4:03:44] <%VHGS> god bless the ring
[4:03:46] <%Dragon_Batman> I say Nier has best original soundtrack overall but this has more range
[4:03:46] <%valkuma> EHRGEIZ WAS GOOD SHIT
[4:03:47] <%Aydarkzero> never played Nier
[4:03:54] <%RAAAAAINMAKER> PC mod will just be 'change battle music to Smash 'em Rip 'em'
[4:03:59] <%valriot> *insert menu sound*
[4:03:59] <%Brickston> People, people, what we need is a new Xenogears
[4:04:06] <%NitronStreams> Weight of the world is a pretty damn good song
[4:04:08] <%Taglog7> YOYO LADY Kreygasm
[4:04:08] <%Legato_Ambrose> I think I'd pick Nier Automata's OST over this, tbh
[4:04:09] <%tizz86> @barkon345 both are fantastic, i prefer ff7r just a bit more
[4:04:12] <%PanicSwytch> REMAKE THE BOUNCER
[4:04:18] <%Legato_Ambrose> It'd be close though
[4:04:19] <%Spiralpower1620> ^^^
[4:04:22] <%ape_hawk> we need a good Crystal Chronicles game
[4:04:25] <%Garthunox> new ehrgeiz, same menu noise
[4:04:25] <%Legato_Ambrose> and thankfully I can just have both, so
[4:04:25] <%Aracon_> yeah go camera go
[4:04:35] <%croxeye> the amount of range in this soundtrack is incredible, and as much as i like the nier soundtrack it doesn't have a lot of variaty tbh
[4:04:35] <%TheMattman1313> Haste makes Tifa too fast for the camera
[4:04:41] <%KawaiiJetty> Camera doin it
[4:04:44] <%superchronicc> Nier was somewhat original with the sequel soundtrack, while this game's soundtrack, while good, is mostly made up of a bumch of remixes of the old soundtrack\
[4:04:49] <%GohanHitsugaya> Yeah, camera big problem in this game.
[4:05:01] <%Bane_Kaikyo> the right side of my headphones are finally giving out... doing me a god damn sad
[4:05:01] <%valkuma> people really will reach for any excuse to say something negative about this
[4:05:04] <%barkon345> they should remake FF8 without the busted Drawing and Junctioning system
[4:05:05] <%Garthunox> @superchronicc and?
[4:05:10] <%NitronStreams> level 3 spells are rediculous
[4:05:16] <%mechslayer71> Songs like Valkyrie’s theme and Final Experiment are God tier. Nier has great music, but with this game I literally said “WHY IS EVERY SONG SO GOOD” almost every time a new song played
[4:05:23] <%Spiralpower1620> Remake FFVI before FFVIII
[4:05:41] <%ape_hawk> Remake FFX for HD Lulu
[4:05:44] <%superchronicc> I hate how when i lock on, anytime i shift the camera, it changes targets
[4:05:45] <%Engwithan_Elder_God> IMMUNE
[4:05:47] <%Legato_Ambrose> @Spiralpower1620 That.
[4:05:50] <%barkon345> @mechslayer71 I said the same thing to every song in Neir Auatomata as well
[4:05:51] <%Verd_254> I said that for both tbh, i adore both ost's
[4:05:56] <%Dragon_Batman> @Bane_Kaikyo I hate that soo much
[4:05:56] <%Dakuu75> would be cool if we got tier 4 "-ja" spells. they could jsut eat ALL your mp
[4:05:57] <%Legato_Ambrose> 6 should be next remake
[4:06:00] <%cvp5127> @ape_hawk this
[4:06:00] <%doc_ock_rokc> WE EAT CRAB TONIGHT
[4:06:08] <%GohanHitsugaya> Some of the best music I've heard comes form Xenosaga 2 & 3
[4:06:08] <%Aracon_> 🦀 no more damage 🦀
[4:06:13] <%ThriftyShell> Chrono Trigger should be the next remake
[4:06:15] <%mechslayer71> @barkon345 It wasn’t as intense in Nier for me
[4:06:15] <%barkon345> Half Life much
[4:06:26] <%Spiralpower1620> I need to see and hear Kefka in HD Kreygasm
[4:06:31] <%rytyoung> Kinda thought it was the snake enemy from Doom Eternal, my heart skipped a beat LUL
[4:06:31] <%Metballs> Remake 5 so we can see that dumb bullshit DBZ fight between a turtle and a tree in glorious 4k
[4:06:40] <%Bane_Kaikyo> @Dragon_Batman Happens all the time with me.... I'm lucky if a pair lasts longer than a month :/
[4:06:41] <%Spiralpower1620> Dissidia doesn’t count
[4:06:45] <%valkuma> venomantis' are the beefier grashtrikes
[4:06:46] <%croxeye> @ThriftyShell i disagree, chrono trigger is perfect as it is
[4:06:47] <%RAAAAAINMAKER> Oh I farmed this battle challenge, 150 AP in a minute with a Blizaraga Magnify
[4:06:48] <%Felto3> HD kefka has already happened twice
[4:06:50] <%superchronicc> @Spiralpower1620 couldnt you in dissidia?
[4:06:55] <%maenos2> Oh, GRASHtrike not gGASHstrike
[4:07:01] <%PanicSwytch> Chrono Cross Remake
[4:07:02] <%optimasmaximas> @nitronstreams yeah curaga isn’t even necessasary unless you prob do new game plus cause it out heals by a couple thousand
[4:07:08] <%barkon345> Eh I cant picture Chrono trigger being any better with updated graphics. it would need to look like the latest Dragon Quest game to really work
[4:07:14] <%Dragon_Batman> @Bane_Kaikyo I feel you, using buds, cuz those for me need quick changes
[4:07:15] <%KawaiiJetty> Dissidia Kefka exists and i love it
[4:07:19] <%Buzzard42> @Felto3 no but HD final boss Kefka
[4:07:24] <%valkuma> @optimasmaximas curaga magnify is a full group heal with minimal overheal
[4:07:27] <%Buzzard42> HD tower kefka
[4:07:27] <%doc_ock_rokc> @Spiralpower1620 That VA they grabbed for Dissidia was great He was SMACK....dab accurate
[4:07:31] <%barkon345> FF6 would work way better as a remake
[4:07:36] <%mechslayer71> @barkon345 Or they could keep the 2D and octopath travelled it
[4:07:40] <%Buzzard42> ooh
[4:07:41] <%akaAxi0m> ffxiv kefka is also a thing
[4:07:45] <%Felto3> God kefka hD is in XIV
[4:07:48] <%Legato_Ambrose> Yeah, if they do remake ff6 they need Kefka's dissidia va
[4:07:51] <%Buzzard42> an Octopath Traveller style remake of old FF games would be dope
[4:08:02] <%superchronicc> @Felto3 that right i forgot about that kefka
[4:08:02] <%Brickston> @valkuma pray is a magnified curaga without the slot and without the MP and without the cast time
[4:08:04] <%barkon345> @mechslayer71 yea but then at that point why even do a remake then
[4:08:07] <%Dakuu75> no one ever uses antidotes when they poisoned. even Max never did
[4:08:11] <%Buzzard42> Octopath and Bravely Default are already excellent successors to the old FF style
[4:08:18] <%barkon345> its pretty much going to be the same game
[4:08:24] <%Legato_Ambrose> Poison just didn't seem that bad in this game
[4:08:27] <%RAAAAAINMAKER> They suck
[4:08:28] <%mechslayer71> @barkon345 They can change other things than visuals, same way FF7 R did
[4:08:30] <%ShichiNoBushi> No probolo.
[4:08:33] <%croxeye> @Dakuu75 cuz it doesn't last outside of battle which is a much appreciated design decision
[4:08:42] <%coreyyotto> accessory
[4:08:46] <%SH1NK1R0> @dakuu75 it’s not really worth the atb when you lose poison as soon as the enemy dies and it doesn’t do that much damage
[4:08:46] <%valriot> man, i hope the Octopath team is doing a FF6 remaster. That game has ZERO good ports
[4:08:48] <%Engwithan_Elder_God> accessories
[4:08:48] <%Spiralpower1620> I want FFVI to be updated graphically and gameplay wise

[4:09:01] <%YakumoYomi> @Dakuu75 I didn't even bother to stock Antidotes. I don't think Poison can even kill you in this game.

[4:09:20] <%BubbaRands> its okay
[4:09:21] <%ShichiNoBushi> Check in Equip screen.
[4:09:24] <%superchronicc> @Spiralpower1620 is it because you want to see a ghost train get suplexed in 4k?
[4:09:25] <%ape_hawk> no, it didnt
[4:09:25] <%Engwithan_Elder_God> no
[4:09:33] <%doc_ock_rokc> @ape_hawk You mean like that fake gun thing?
[4:09:36] <%Spiralpower1620> @superchronicc Among other things
[4:09:45] <%tizz86> it is

[4:10:12] <%TheMattman1313> Boys night out
[4:10:15] <%Aracon_> they'll probably bump it to 70 for disc 2
[4:10:27] <%BubbaRands> saturdays are for the boiz
[4:10:29] <%croxeye> i ended the game in the mid-high 30's didn't do excessive grinding (other than moogle medals for turbo ethers) and did all sidequests, i felt like i was very appropriately leveled for the late game
[4:10:34] <%SolidusRex> 50 was the cap in the NES Final Fantasy
[4:10:39] <%superchronicc> just give me the advent skin for this and ill be good
[4:10:40] <%Dakuu75> DAMN, not the potion! that's like 50 gil
[4:10:42] <%mechslayer71> @croxeye Same, I was 40
[4:11:00] <%RAAAAAINMAKER> No way I should have my Lv 50 character start Remake 2, My characters are OP after 3 playthroughs
[4:11:10] <%Dakuu75> is there an item for sleep?
[4:11:20] <%ape_hawk> so how much of the domestic abuse are they gonna show when we get to Cid?
[4:11:21] <%superchronicc> @Dakuu75 i think so
[4:11:21] <%croxeye> @RAAAAAINMAKER we're def getting deleveled/materia deleveling

[4:19:17] <%Quigsies> He keeps silencing himself
[4:19:24] <%Brickston> he just keeps stepping in the silence poo gas
[4:19:29] <%Spiralpower1620> @celiohogane Even better slySmug
[4:19:44] <%Tiewolf> wow typing sux right now...
[4:19:47] <%CelioHogane> Alive Jenova has to be the scariest shit ever.

[4:19:50] <%fragdar> yo, legit question.. how do i get on the discord server? i conected the discord to twitch but nothing happened
[4:19:51] <%ScreamLord> There's no Thunder Summon in this game is there?
[4:19:54] <%TurtlesAndTentacles> He did a ton of damage though
[4:19:55] <%GohanHitsugaya> Iron his sphere Pat
[4:20:01] <%Caped_Eggy> I just kill this guy without staggering him
[4:20:03] <%mechslayer71> @screamlord Nope
[4:20:05] <%Keyd00d> I wish Ramuh was in this one
[4:20:06] <%ArcanumMBD> Pat just spam magic on the sphere, he doesnt' have to be pressured
[4:20:11] <%Pyroclase> I just found a an article from 2010 where Square talks about an FFVII remake being unrealistic
[4:20:19] <%PanicSwytch> U have to polish his Orb Pat
[4:20:23] <%Spiralpower1620> I’m looking forward to fighting the weapons and their designs
[4:20:26] <%Aracon_> no me
[4:20:27] <%Keyd00d> Yeah it was around when XIII released
[4:20:27] <%LaughingCatt> but do you tho
[4:20:28] <%RAAAAAINMAKER> Did anyone get the Barret in the Garden romance option?

[4:20:35] <%Keyd00d> They said HD cities are impossible to make
[4:20:36] <%VritraReiRei> I got this :)
[4:20:37] <%CelioHogane> @Pyroclase that's why they split it into parts.
[4:20:37] <%Caped_Eggy> Pat's waiting for thundaga I bet
[4:20:38] <%YakumoYomi> No longer Silenced

[4:21:52] <%spiritofmojave> round 4 doesn't fuck around
[4:22:01] <%amiroodude> Well he wanted a difficulty spike
[4:22:06] <%optimasmaximas> PogChamp
[4:22:18] <%Spiralpower1620> I wish this game had a jump for Combat
[4:22:22] <%tizz86> sad thing is, all these are pretty easy fights
[4:22:28] <%Spiralpower1620> Or just in general
[4:22:30] <%NitronStreams> OOF
[4:22:35] <%siamzero94> the lockdown
[4:22:36] <%arcielardor> Barret sounds like Turret. Coincidence?
[4:22:42] <%tizz86> pat just refuses to capitalize
[4:22:44] <%Brickston> @tizz86 if this has the last fight I remember you can get stunlocked
[4:22:44] <%Piemen99> STUN LOCK BABY
[4:22:48] <%KawaiiJetty> Just tank it psaWhat
[4:23:00] <%siamzero94> Ah it's just bomb in english
[4:23:25] <%Spiralpower1620> Ok legitimate question who else is excited for Tankceratops in the next part slySmug
[4:23:25] <%GohanHitsugaya> Use Pray Pat
[4:23:38] <%Keyd00d> spend that atb
[4:23:55] <%YakumoYomi> ONE MORE
[4:23:56] <%siamzero94> oh god one more
[4:23:59] <%Brickston> @Spiralpower1620 yeah bro can't wait for part 2 in 2037
[4:23:59] <%tizz86> @brickston it's a manner of switching when needed to and battle management
[4:24:18] <%ConLin_Arts_> Lightning Returns
[4:24:20] <%NitronStreams> Metal... Gear?
[4:24:23] <%tizz86> the monodrive is just annoying
[4:24:28] <%Dragon_Batman> He go in, he kill
[4:24:30] <%valkuma> the jury rigged cutter is so scary
[4:24:31] <%Spiralpower1620> I wanna see how stupid that design will look in this engine LUL
[4:24:39] <%Piemono> Why does the Juyr-rigged version look better than the normal versions?
[4:24:54] <%Brickston> because Shinra is incompetent
[4:25:02] <%Dragon_Batman> Illegal modding does that usually
[4:25:03] <%superstarsage> Because Flames make everything cooler
[4:25:07] <%valkuma> @Piemono because its a regular cutter but with blackmarket addons, "jury rigged" isnt really the right term
[4:25:16] <%Piemono> Gotcha
[4:25:20] <%saynof> Thea Jury-Rig looks like a freaking Rokket with that colour scheme
[4:25:34] <%Tiewolf> this song reminds me of Jojo part 5
[4:25:50] <%HRDSalami654> Platinum convinced me that any dodge without slowdown is garbage.
[4:26:10] <%Daxalog> Dodge with slowdown is a crutch
[4:26:25] <%HRDSalami654> The dodge in this game is particularly bad because it doesn't even have i frames.
[4:26:28] <%NitronStreams> LUL
[4:26:31] <%Spiralpower1620> You’ll never hear Cloud say some stupid Shit like “Destiny is Destiny!”
[4:26:32] <%AllenDeadman> LUL
[4:26:39] <%GohanHitsugaya> GG
[4:26:43] <%Dragon_Batman> Yea for me the big smogger is the hardest at out the rest
[4:26:44] <%saynof> NO RE
[4:26:50] <%moogleboy1984> @Spiralpower1620 but what about Dilly-Dally Shilly-Shally?
[4:26:53] <%ConLin_Arts_> LUL

[4:26:58] <%NitronStreams> !uptime
[4:26:58] <%Pyroclase> this victory theme makes me happy inside

[4:27:07] <%Keyd00d> was that all of them?
[4:27:08] <%Spiralpower1620> @moogleboy1984 Let’s not talk about that Kappa
[4:27:13] <%SolidusRex> Only 5 on BEST coast
[4:27:14] <%Engwithan_Elder_God> Good games make time fly
[4:27:18] <%Keyd00d> Nice work
[4:27:22] <%RAAAAAINMAKER> So concludes the Sidequest stream
[4:27:22] <%ringabal> @PatStaresAt It's about 1 more hour until the no return wall
[4:27:32] <%weissguard> Time flies when your stream is fun.
[4:27:35] <%Dragon_Batman> Pretty much
[4:27:36] <%prism_zet> ish
[4:27:36] <%KawaiiJetty> Guess some story progress?
[4:27:38] <%Metballs> tbf to One Guy, he still hasn't finished his sidequests
[4:27:40] <%cvp5127> fair
[4:27:41] <%DeaconBluesClues> someone pm me if he that the two person fight yet. that one.

[4:27:48] <%ape_hawk> shinra bout to get its shit wrecked
[4:27:50] <%Keyd00d> If you wanna finish it next stream that's about 8-9 hours
[4:27:51] <%Mornaka> meh
[4:27:52] <%Pyroclase> should be two more streams after this, then
[4:27:52] <%Spiralpower1620> After P5 and this Pat will be out of games Kappa
[4:27:52] <%gatoralus> exactly pat
[4:27:56] <%Engwithan_Elder_God> I wasn't going to say that.
[4:28:02] <%Sir_stride> on Wednesday?
[4:28:03] <%valriot> You have like 7-8 hours left probably
[4:28:06] <%spiritofmojave> oh yeah next stream will be pretty long
[4:28:06] <%TurtlesAndTentacles> I honestly do like your beard
[4:28:06] <%j0ustar> handsome sure.
[4:28:08] <%Aracon_> the ending is reeeeeally long so yeah next stream sounds right
[4:28:10] <%ArcanumMBD> Pat why aren't you using the nail bat like a real hero?
[4:28:11] <%GohanHitsugaya> Yep, that's how it usually goes right Pat.
[4:28:12] <%CelioHogane> @Spiralpower1620 nah he can start playing Digimon Cyber Sleuth
[4:28:17] <%ape_hawk> pat doesnt stream on sundays so he can go to church and grind out his heaven access levels
[4:28:19] <%CelioHogane> IT'S PERSONA BUT WITH DIGIMON
[4:28:26] <%Dragon_Batman> I wouldn't be surprised if it's 2 streams
[4:28:26] <@SoFarFetched> He didn't like the feel of the Nail Bat.
[4:28:27] <%GohanHitsugaya> *?
[4:28:30] <%Spiralpower1620> @celiohogane He’s into that
[4:28:34] <%ConLin_Arts_> I bought Hacker's Memory recently
[4:28:35] <%RetroCop87> Wowee Pat, you're as handsome as Paige
[4:28:38] <%CelioHogane> @Spiralpower1620 that makes it better, then
[4:28:39] <%NitronStreams> HI Paige
[4:28:40] <%ConLin_Arts_> I really liked the first one
[4:28:41] <%JD_Lars> Leviathan?
[4:28:41] <%amiroodude> I reckon 2 more streams until the end
[4:28:46] <%GohanHitsugaya> Paige back
[4:28:57] <%Legato_Ambrose> at least 2
[4:28:58] <%ringabal> ehhhhh
[4:29:00] <%CelioHogane> My copy of Cyber Sleuth for switch should get here tomorrow or monday
[4:29:01] <%CelioHogane> should.
[4:29:05] <%Metballs> Did he not do Levi yet?
[4:29:09] <%Dragon_Batman> Whack a box as well
[4:29:13] <%Keyd00d> Leviathan at 30-ish is doable without much trouble
[4:29:16] <%spiritofmojave> you could try by now for sure
[4:29:22] <%cvp5127> is leviathan ice?
[4:29:24] <%Dakuu75> Hi Paige, hope you doing all right, atm.
[4:29:24] <%ScreamLord> I suggest lots of Thunder Materia
[4:29:28] <%Keyd00d> it's no element
[4:29:29] <%NitronStreams> Hey those officers
[4:29:37] <%KasiCrafter> Time to get wiped by Levi! PogChamp
[4:29:38] <%spiritofmojave> @cvp5127 for some weird reason he's unaspected
[4:29:43] <%ScreamLord> @cvp5127 Water, SHiva is Ice
[4:29:45] <%Keyd00d> they took water element out
[4:29:46] <%Manjove> Leviathan is damage
[4:29:57] <%cvp5127> got it
[4:29:58] <%Legato_Ambrose> More like washed away amiriiiite...
[4:29:59] <%Dakuu75> lol pat's eyes glaring up when he hears "bacon"
[4:30:03] <%ape_hawk> nod with your penis
[4:30:04] <%spiritofmojave> no water element doesn't exist now, and earth is out too for some reason
[4:30:07] <%Dragon_Batman> Koolio
[4:30:10] <%PanicSwytch> Eat the rest of the Dutch baby
[4:30:11] <%TheBenson8r> P E E P O O P S
[4:30:11] <%TurtlesAndTentacles> poop pees
[4:30:12] <%ArcanumMBD> He's unaspected because there's no water element. So I guess you can argue he's water-pressure element
[4:30:13] <%j0ustar> Paige is 10 times more handsome than Pat. It's the chin
[4:30:14] <%spiritofmojave> don't fall in
[4:30:17] <%Legato_Ambrose> don't drown in your pee poops
[4:30:20] <%CelioHogane> @ScreamLord i don't understand why the fuck Leviathan is in this game instead of Rammuh when fucking Water element isn't in the game.
[4:30:21] <%DukeBlack_> She's gonna bidet your holes
[4:30:28] <%prism_zet> "its not easy mode"
[4:30:31] <%GohanHitsugaya> Naw man, it's the nose.
[4:30:35] <%Metballs> I can't believe he's going to secretly swap to Easy Mode
[4:30:39] <%Spiralpower1620> Pee poop hype
[4:30:45] <%NitronStreams> Bless me with your gift of lights
[4:30:53] <%NitronStreams> Righteous cause on judgment nighs
[4:30:55] <%gatoralus> anyone know if pat ever played more xenoblade 2 after the streams
[4:31:01] <%NitronStreams> Feel the sorrow the light has swallowed
[4:31:04] <%RAAAAAINMAKER> Yo did anyone even use Carbuckle?
[4:31:05] <%Spiralpower1620> Place your bets is he CURRENTLY removing all his clothes as we speak? slySmug
[4:31:06] <%spiritofmojave> pretty sure Ramuh is at the Golden Saucer, right before you chocobo race
[4:31:06] <%CelioHogane> @gatoralus he played Xenoblade 2 on stream!?
[4:31:14] <%NitronStreams> Feel the freedom like no tomorrow
[4:31:15] <%Dragon_Batman> I don't think he did go more in xenoblade 2
[4:31:30] <%YakumoYomi> @CelioHogane He played the first few hours, but I think that's it
[4:31:36] <%Darkfire346> RE6 second run, lets go!
[4:31:37] <%CelioHogane> @spiritofmojave and Sephiroth throws Ifrit or shiva at your face, so?
[4:31:45] <%gatoralus> @CelioHogane yeah in like december 2017 its on his youtube, he only played it twice i think
[4:32:11] <%spiritofmojave> @celiohogane sorry wasn't arguing just noting :b
[4:32:17] <%Spiralpower1620> Ok HE’S GOTTA be naked by now Kappa
[4:32:19] <%spiritofmojave> but accurate ye
[4:33:27] <%Dragon_Batman> I mean they gotta leave some summons for the next games
[4:34:12] <%Darkfire346> i think Pat fell in
[4:34:19] <%Metballs> Yeah, they have to leave the 5 different types of Bahamut
[4:34:26] <%Mornaka> He's making a TP fort
[4:34:34] <%NitronStreams> Cant wait for Bahamut hearts 3

[4:47:50] <%Tearonex> Leslie is great
[4:47:51] <%ape_hawk> hmm

[4:47:56] <%optimasmaximas> Leslie is cool
[4:47:56] <%Daniel_Is_I> He helped you guys out before
[4:47:57] <%TurtlesAndTentacles> chill black man lol
[4:47:57] <%Darkfire346> HMMMMM
[4:47:57] <%Keyd00d> He's not the worst
[4:47:57] <%Meow0369> Can someone ask the ghosts to evict this guy?
[4:47:58] <%CelioHogane> @Solid_Stro he looks like an edgy Noctis
[4:48:00] <%Aracon_> him and chadley are just weird creatures
[4:48:00] <%Quigsies> He's from the book right?
[4:48:08] <%Laecerelius> We gonna get some Leslie side chapters?
[4:48:15] <%Treuan> Phrasing, Barrett
[4:48:17] <%Legato_Ambrose> Except he was totally fine with all the OTHER women getting sold to Corneo
[4:48:25] <%optimasmaximas> @celiohogane wasn’t noctis already edgy? LUL
[4:48:33] <%TheBenson8r> HIDEY HOLE
[4:48:35] <%Darkfire346> yep
[4:48:38] <%myriad_truth> Look at these Anime characters!
[4:48:38] <%mechslayer71> @legato_ambrose less fine, more tolerating
[4:48:40] <%optimasmaximas> back to the sewers LUL
[4:48:40] <%Spiralpower1620> Noctis only LOOKED edgy
[4:48:41] <%heartlesshealer> Oh! He's gonna flush out Corneo
[4:48:42] <%Keyd00d> "Damn, yeah I was"
[4:48:45] <%Pyroclase> his Jacket
[4:48:47] <%Eddy21forsaken> so he can make sure
[4:48:48] <%rufus2k2> It's an Intimidate Check
[4:48:48] <%ape_hawk> "got me there!"
[4:48:50] <%tallik44123> not reallly he was fishing boy
[4:48:51] <%Aracon_> yup you got me barret
[4:48:52] <%CelioHogane> @optimasmaximas you haven't played XV, did you? Noctis is a nerd that doesn't eat vegetables and loves fishing and Assasin's Creed
[4:48:54] <%NitronStreams> No one wants to see Corneos's hole
[4:48:56] <%BubbaRands> OOOPS WELL YOU GOT MEEEE LUL
[4:48:56] <%Solid_Stro> Because it’s Barret doodRage
[4:48:57] <%Engwithan_Elder_God> Maybe he's a bad liar.
[4:48:58] <%spiritofmojave> Barret thinks that antagonists are super transparent
[4:48:58] <%weissguard> See if they flinch, yeah.
[4:49:00] <%Meow0369> Why are pistols being treated like they can kill people? Guns in this world does like less than a 100th of peoples health
[4:49:06] <%VritraReiRei> "Yes, I'm will DEFINITELY screw you over" :)
[4:49:08] <%hzealot> that's not how it works pat
[4:49:10] <%ConLin_Arts_> go back
[4:49:10] <%RetroCop87> explore
[4:49:11] <%Darkfire346> "Fine by me" *CRAAAAAWLING IN MY SKIIIIIN*
[4:49:12] <%Valdorick> I'm glad Noctis still has astrong sense of justice.
[4:49:13] <%myriad_truth> At least Cloud is getting better
[4:49:18] <%Guardiansaiyan> @hzealot you don't know that!
[4:49:20] <%CelioHogane> @Meow0369 i mean, it will stirt hurt

[4:49:20] <%Nupinoop296> back to the sewers huh
[4:49:31] <%siamzero94> @Meow0369 plot guns vs game guns
[4:49:34] <%j0ustar> Gold bars on the floor...just there
[4:49:36] <%ConLin_Arts_> there was a scene down to the room where you met Tifa
[4:49:36] <%Dragon_Batman> Sewer bois

[4:49:47] <%myriad_truth> I see it
[4:49:48] <%CelioHogane> DIFFERENT PERSONALITY; THO
[4:49:48] <%Axellogic> Nomura man
[4:49:48] <%spiritofmojave> yeah basically
[4:49:48] <%RetroCop87> he's a novel character
[4:49:48] <%Guardiansaiyan> Noctis on HARD TIMES
[4:49:48] <%heartlesshealer> gas station noctis
[4:49:49] <%DEETRz> yeah
[4:49:49] <%Dragon_Batman> Fishing outfit specifically
[4:49:50] <%Aracon_> it's yozora
[4:49:50] <%Keyd00d> Gotta reuse a dungeon again
[4:49:50] <%cowardman93> Nomura strikes again
[4:49:51] <%ringabal> Versus 13 Noctic
[4:49:51] <%Nupinoop296> Yozora
[4:49:52] <%Aydarkzero> i thought the same thing LUL
[4:49:53] <%Meow0369> It's noctis except somehow worse
[4:49:56] <%startstoprepeat> @PatStaresAt there's an extra chakra materia if you search the mansion basement before continuing
[4:49:57] <%Spiralpower1620> I feel like Cloud and Leslie are struggling for who’s the edgiest in the room
[4:49:58] <%Solid_Stro> Discount Noctis
[4:49:58] <%spiritofmojave> He's the Nomura character
[4:50:00] <%BubbaRands> He's just Noctis. PRINCE DETHRONED
[4:50:01] <%CelioHogane> NOCTIS BUT NOT FUNNY
[4:50:02] <%Guardiansaiyan> NOCTIS doing CRIMES
[4:50:02] <%ape_hawk> your face is a novel character
[4:50:03] <@SoFarFetched> Gimme my fat chocobo psaGib
[4:50:03] <%Ynkubus18> Not-ctis
[4:50:05] <%ape_hawk> got em
[4:50:05] <%ConLin_Arts_> I don't remember what materia you missed
[4:50:05] <%Tearonex> His character is deeper than Noctis
[4:50:05] <%optimasmaximas> @celiohogane oh, TRUST ME, i played xv, foolishly bought the $400 collector’s edition, but i thought you were talking about edgy by basing it off appearance
[4:50:06] <%j0ustar> Noctis was trying hard to be Leslie
[4:50:10] <%TheMattman1313> What if he's a young grandpa Cid
[4:50:10] <%optimasmaximas> Yes
[4:50:10] <%Aydarkzero> we got Leslie, Noctis and Yozora
[4:50:14] <%Spiralpower1620> Nah he’s Riku KH3 deanPeek
[4:50:17] <%VritraReiRei> Also kind of like that guy from Final Fantasy Type 0?
[4:50:19] <%Meow0369> WORST ENEMIES IN THE GAME HERE
[4:50:21] <%Taglog7> Sewer or later
[4:50:22] <%ConLin_Arts_> there is a Stash here later on Pat!
[4:50:23] <%mechslayer71> @optimasmaximas 400 dollars?!?! cmonBruh cmonBruh cmonBruh
[4:50:29] <%goose_attack_almanac> The Camera loves Tifas Tiffos
[4:50:32] <%Eddy21forsaken> chadley and leslie are left over KH/FFXV Nomura concept characters
[4:50:33] <%Guardiansaiyan> He said the SAME THING to CLOUD @PatStaresAt
[4:50:33] <%Keyd00d> 400 dollars on XV? I'm so sorry
[4:50:34] <%Darkfire346> I PITY DA FOOL
[4:50:35] <%Meow0369> Fucking headbutt
[4:50:35] <%CelioHogane> @optimasmaximas I mean he doesn't look that edgy, Noctis does look edgier, but personality wise, totally the reverse.
[4:50:39] <%Treuan> Me want honeycomb
[4:50:39] <%Aracon_> fucking love barret
[4:50:40] <%cumurasame> Barret is just a BIG TSUNDERE for PRETTY BOYS
[4:50:42] <%myriad_truth> Barret is such a character
[4:50:43] <%NitronStreams> Barret's treating him like the new Cloud
[4:50:43] <%Legato_Ambrose> Your UNLIMITED bullets
[4:50:43] <%spiritofmojave> BEE analogies
[4:50:45] <%Scarnehu> you were saying about breaking bad!
[4:50:46] <%ringabal> I want Leslie and Yozora to fusion dance into Shin Nomura
[4:50:50] <%spiritofmojave> Love ya Barret
[4:50:52] <%Guardiansaiyan> @NitronStreams TRUTH
[4:50:52] <%RetroCop87> can't wait until modders replace leslie with Dante
[4:51:01] <%YakumoYomi> I love Tsundere Barret
[4:51:02] <%CelioHogane> HARDLY CAN TAKE THEM IN MY OWN, ME, TOTALLY OC CHARACTER
[4:51:11] <%Tiewolf> Look at this KH Voice actor
[4:51:11] <%Keyd00d> and then he busts him immediately
[4:51:16] <%rufus2k2> I think honeycomb is a damn better alternative to swiss cheese
[4:51:17] <%CelioHogane> This guy talks like if he was a secret party member.
[4:51:22] <%Engwithan_Elder_God> Thanks for spoiling that Pat.
[4:51:22] <%amiroodude> LUL replace badger with wedge
[4:51:22] <%rufus2k2> swiss cheese is so cliche
[4:51:33] <%Darkfire346> EMO LEAN
[4:51:33] <%NitronStreams> SUS
[4:51:33] <%rufus2k2> also that cop was frigging DJ Qualls
[4:51:34] <%logoth_> Look at this Nomura self insert
[4:51:35] <%Guardiansaiyan> that POSE
[4:51:36] <%Meow0369> Bye worst character in the game
[4:51:39] <%Dragon_Batman> Remix
[4:51:40] <%Solid_Stro> Good guys always lie, Villains always tell the truth
[4:51:46] <%Ultimatefool> Why is Alt Noctis even here
[4:51:50] <%Aracon_> sewers got all screwy
[4:51:50] <%optimasmaximas> @celiohogane oh absolutely, i agree in that regard, I just thought you meant appearance lol
[4:51:51] <%Manjove> Leslie isnt that bad
[4:51:54] <%ringabal> Hey, naps are a rare commodity under the don
[4:51:54] <%CelioHogane> @Meow0369 he really is worse than poochie.
[4:51:57] <%Tearonex> that's what happens when a plate falls
[4:51:58] <%logoth_> Leslie's better than Chadley at least
[4:51:58] <%johnchikr> Apparently Leslie is a character from the novelizations
[4:51:59] <%Verd_254> I don't get why people are comparing him to Noctis. He honestly looks completely different to me.
[4:52:00] <%Scarnehu> tXd
[4:52:03] <%cumurasame> Also apparently cops do NOT need to tell you. Hell they can even do the big crimes. They just can't PLAN the big crimes.
[4:52:05] <%optimasmaximas> we now got 3 noctis now LUL
[4:52:06] <%suikudo> oh boy oh boy
[4:52:06] <%KasiCrafter> Turns out dropping a plate on super old infrastructure rattles stuff around a bit.
[4:52:07] <%CelioHogane> @optimasmaximas honestly i love that Noctis looks edgy but he is super a nerd.
[4:52:15] <%Dakuu75> that big monster ever died, right? He just coolaid-man'd his way through a wall and fucked off.
[4:52:15] <%Meow0369> Leslie makes me wanna burn books, specifically the ones he's in
[4:52:16] <%heartlesshealer> I love how the party members can just bump boxes around all over
[4:52:22] <%Darkfire346> I cant believe we traded the gay hottub scene for Leslie
[4:52:22] <%logoth_> Sahagin here I am this'll be a treat
[4:52:28] <%ringabal> Okay, people who read the novels, can someone give me the short version of what happens?
[4:52:29] <%mechslayer71> @dakuu75 Right
[4:52:30] <%CelioHogane> @Dakuu75 totally alive, yes, wich i guess this is the reason why he did.
[4:52:36] <%Manjove> the only thing he has in common with Noctis is the Jacket and hairstyle
[4:52:41] <%CelioHogane> @ringabal irrelevant shit, that happens
[4:52:45] <%mechslayer71> @meow0369 Really burning you up inside, huh?
[4:52:46] <%heartlesshealer> Prayer go up!
[4:52:47] <%myriad_truth> I hate those ninja turtles
[4:52:50] <%Scarnehu> XD I completely forgot about that scene. God,those guys were stupid
[4:53:01] <%Solid_Stro> I’d rather have Jules than Leslie
[4:53:04] <%Keyd00d> dial UP those titties
[4:53:05] <%Verd_254> Even his hair isn't that similar. At all actually.
[4:53:06] <@SoFarFetched> D: D: D:
[4:53:06] <%VritraReiRei> I thought we weren't doing story tonight? 🤔
[4:53:07] <%Aracon_> hggGasm
[4:53:07] <%ape_hawk> she can, with a breast reduction
[4:53:13] <%optimasmaximas> @celiohogane i like that tho, reminds me of how cloud looks like a badass but is a total dork and is trying to be cool
[4:53:15] <%YakumoYomi> Dial up that ass, tho.
[4:53:16] <%heartlesshealer> bye bench
[4:53:18] <%spiritofmojave> imagine she can suck them in
[4:53:18] <%NitronStreams> She can only tighten her bra so much pat
[4:53:22] <%Aracon_> lol
[4:53:23] <%Dakuu75> lol
[4:53:23] <%myriad_truth> I'm pretty sure Tifa is a DD
[4:53:23] <%Piemen99> @PatStaresAt Was this in the original?
[4:53:27] <%BlueMoonBlues> Turns out Leslie and Kyrie aren't OC's of this game, they originated from a 2011 side story novella
[4:53:28] <%Metballs> tbf, this is 100% Leslie story stuff
[4:53:30] <%ringabal> What a Pat thing to say
[4:53:30] <%CelioHogane> @optimasmaximas Dumbass characters are the best.
[4:53:31] <%Daxalog> What Materia do I cast enlarge dick? Asking for friend.
[4:53:32] <%Keyd00d> you'll be at a good point next stream
[4:53:36] <%Metballs> And who gives a shit about Leslie
[4:53:38] <%Spiralpower1620> I’m excited to see Dorky Cloud
[4:53:39] <%TalisKanju> FUCK PAT'S DOING STORY
[4:53:41] <%Meow0369> I think pat has two more streams of the game left about this one
[4:53:42] <%CelioHogane> @BlueMoonBlues i mean, they might as well be OCs, since new designs...
[4:53:44] <%Ultimatefool> Whoa, the TMNT are Dragoons?
[4:53:46] <%ahdurian> @DexteraXIII Magnify
[4:53:46] <%Dakuu75> "I ran outa side quests" man, that's a Pat-problem right there.
[4:53:48] <%Dementedpenguin> Yeah, I was shocked when I looked over and saw an actual cutscene LUL
[4:53:53] <%Dragon_Batman> @Daxalog Magnify would be my guess
[4:53:54] <%Sir_stride> there's actually a side quest part in here.
[4:54:00] <%YakumoYomi> @BlueMoonBlues That would explain why they look better than generic NPCs
[4:54:06] <%pmoneydarthswagg> Just remember to get the last Corneo vault down here
[4:54:16] <%Solid_Stro> This whole chapter should’ve just been called side quest
[4:54:16] <%moogleboy1984> Kyrie is shit though
[4:54:17] <%ScreamLord> Realistically OG FF7 Tifa was like a G or H cup. This Tifa is a DD
[4:54:21] <%moogleboy1984> worst character
[4:54:21] <%MoonObscure> yup
[4:54:22] <%Meow0369> These enemies are terrible I hate them
[4:54:26] <%Spiralpower1620> I wonder if they’ll legit just make Vincent Alucard design wise
[4:54:26] <%Dakuu75> just take the compliment Barret, fuck
[4:54:28] <%PhantomMiG> Melt
[4:54:29] <%CelioHogane> @Solid_Stro wait, chapters have names!?
[4:54:30] <%suikudo> @ScreamLord TRUTH
[4:54:32] <%Meow0369> Worst enemies worst leslies worst sewer
[4:54:36] <%sporeian94> What if Kyrie is Yuffie in disguise?
[4:54:42] <%Solid_Stro> @celiohogane Yep
[4:54:46] <%Dragon_Batman> Just blizzard
[4:54:49] <%CelioHogane> @sporeian94 can't
[4:54:50] <%Dragon_Batman> They just die
[4:54:53] <%NitronStreams> 🦀
[4:54:53] <%moogleboy1984> @sporeian94 then it'll be the only time I say Yuffie is worst girl
[4:54:58] <%mechslayer71> @screamlord OG FF7 Tifa was made out of cardboard boxes
[4:55:08] <%DukeBlack_> Kyrie isn't a new character
[4:55:15] <%Keyd00d> Kyrie is from a novel
[4:55:17] <%코코꾸라> Kyrie was in a novella
[4:55:17] <%Sir_stride> shes from a book
[4:55:18] <%spiritofmojave> People focus on her cup size, like it was humanly achievable in the original. or would translate to HD and look convincing LUL
[4:55:21] <%siamzero94> does pat know he can just look up enemy info via touchpad?
[4:55:24] <%suikudo> @mechslayer71 pointy boobs are still boobs
[4:55:27] <%Darkfire346> OG Tifa shook her boobs when she walked. Literally.
[4:55:27] <%ScreamLord> @mechslayer71 The FMVs dude
[4:55:33] <%Keyd00d> Yeah humans don't have big breasts
[4:55:41] <%CelioHogane> @spiritofmojave people are creepyzoids and want huge anime tiddies
[4:55:51] <%Solid_Stro> Hopefully Vincent just stands around and quotes lines from the goth kids in South Park
[4:55:52] <%spiritofmojave> @celiohogane amen
[4:55:58] <%mechslayer71> @screamlord In the original? I didn’t play it so I didn’t so those. Or do you mean the movie?
[4:56:01] <%CelioHogane> @Solid_Stro so you want V.
[4:56:05] <%suikudo> you fight a godamn house fuck what looks human
[4:56:10] <%Spiralpower1620> Vincent: FUCK! ALL OF YOU!!
[4:56:11] <%rufus2k2> stop walking past boxes and not smashing em
[4:56:12] <%MoraMiarty> theres nothing wrong with huge anime toddy you coward
[4:56:13] <%hzealot> did pat get the music disc betwee nsectors 5 and 6?
[4:56:14] <%Manjove> you heard it here first, DD cup sizes for bras are for nothing
[4:56:17] <%Darkfire346> I just want Vincent to be an Alucard clone.
[4:56:18] <%ape_hawk> "vincent, stop complainging about Conformists"
[4:56:24] <%moogleboy1984> @Solid_Stro I want Cid to ask Vincent for a cigarette, and then punch him for smoking Cloves
[4:56:28] <%Keyd00d> they just aren't achievable in real life Kappa
[4:56:35] <%Manjove> Hitomi Tanaka doesnt exist
[4:56:35] <%Solid_Stro> “Life is pain, life is only pain”
[4:56:37] <%Dragon_Batman> If the music disk was the turks theme then yes
[4:56:38] <%CelioHogane> @Solid_Stro you know what? no, i want all his lines to be about how he is gonna torture Hojo
[4:56:42] <%spiritofmojave> @keyd00d I mean if you're Hitomi sure LUL
[4:56:55] <%Tiewolf> Lol Barret the healer XD
[4:56:56] <%suikudo> OG Tifa was basically Hitomi
[4:57:12] <%Sir_stride> Barret is the best
[4:57:17] <%amiroodude> Kinda hope steve blum can voice Vincent again but probably won't
[4:57:19] <%moogleboy1984> The sewer music gives me BIG DDS vibes
[4:57:22] <%Dragon_Batman> That cutscene is what everyone thinks of
[4:57:27] <%Keyd00d> that was a fight
[4:57:31] <%rufus2k2> why would you hope for Steve Blum EVER
[4:57:32] <%Solid_Stro> Hey Vincent what do you want to drink?
[4:57:32] <%sporeian94> Hard mode is so fucking hard. MP conservation is a bitch
[4:57:36] <%ScreamLord> @mechslayer71 The OG had high rez (for the time) cinematics for certain scenes. Lots of SquareEnix games did that in the early 2000s
[4:57:38] <%Solid_Stro> Despair
[4:57:44] <%ScreamLord> *And back
[4:57:46] <%CelioHogane> @amiroodude He won't, all VA in english are new
[4:57:53] <%Tiewolf> Dude gonna heal you with his healing bullets
[4:57:57] <%heartlesshealer> give her more attack and speed?
[4:58:05] <%Spiralpower1620> @amiroodude Vincent is just gonna be another Teen Wolf actor
[4:58:18] <%Spiralpower1620> Or a CW show actor
[4:58:23] <%sporeian94> Vincent voiced by Mike Stoklasa
[4:58:24] <%ahdurian> number go UP
[4:58:37] <%CelioHogane> @Spiralpower1620 make him Green Arrow actor, he loves that shit
[4:58:37] <%amiroodude> @Spiralpower1620 yh that sounds about right
[4:58:38] <%Spiralpower1620> I hope Vincent is Tom Cavanaugh slySmug
[4:58:41] <%Solid_Stro> I imagine Vincent’s gameplay just being gunslinger from DMC
[4:58:49] <%hzealot> F

[5:39:26] <%Axellogic> Grapple Away
[5:39:28] <%Frostydough1> AWW yah the Attack on Titan section
[5:39:30] <%TalisKanju> That's bullshit
[5:39:35] <%amused_platypus> is this part of the original
[5:39:36] <%Felto3> saying it sucks for newcomers is dumb, ofc they don't explain the whole plot in p1
[5:39:37] <%CelioHogane> WAIT WHY ARE GRAPPLING HOOK ONE TIME USE!?

[5:39:52] <%spiritofmojave> BETTER DO ALL THE SIDEQUESTS- I MEAN AFFAIRS
[5:39:52] <%furiousfurioso> You can't shoot a grappling hook downwards is what he means, it makes sense
[5:39:52] <%Dragon_Batman> It's a player thing yea
[5:39:54] <%Mr_Pylon> Pat, you can only grapple in one direction, that's THE LAW
[5:39:54] <%Meow0369> Remember the last time we used grapple hooks?
[5:39:55] <%starotter70> "It's Endgame Cloud"
[5:39:55] <%AllenDeadman> bye cuckboi
[5:39:55] <%Dakuu75> "no backtracking, beyond this point"
[5:39:55] <%ape_hawk> he means you cant grapple hook downhill
[5:39:56] <%cowardman93> yeah but it's fine

[5:41:37] <%ShinyBisharp1> materia slut
[5:41:38] <%Meow0369> Wasn't the bombing referred to as costing billions? An entire PLATE costs like trillions then

[5:42:05] <%Meow0369> The bombings are referred to in direct cost
[5:42:23] <%mechslayer71> @meow0369 the tiaras I mean
[5:42:25] <%SH1NK1R0> @meow0369 10k Gil to people who have never seen more than 2k in their life would set most of them up for a while.
[5:42:30] <%zanzibar_junker> This menu is the Front Mission 3 internet
[5:42:31] <%Solid_Stro> I guess we’ll be Reunioning another time Pat?
[5:42:34] <%Meow0369> The tiara's aren't worth billions I'll say that much

[5:42:49] <%Mr_Pylon> Barret is such a good fucking tank, throw Provoke materia and a crescent accessory and he's the best
[5:42:57] <%Dragon_Batman> It's still better than nothing
[5:43:00] <%cowardman93> it's not about rebuilding the plate, it's about getting a roof over their head and food on plates
[5:43:01] <%prism_zet> you've still got plenty of time for those
[5:43:02] <%RetroCop87> materia in Don's mansion
[5:43:09] <%datmegamandeeeee> Is this Easy Mode???

[6:01:05] <%lotharrio> I think I saw someone tweet at Reggie, giving him psychological information on how to destabilize Woolie, like a week ago.
[6:01:07] <%heartlesshealer> LUL

[6:02:12] <%siamzero94> @king_wragles only in a combo, never raw only mustard
[6:02:14] <@SoFarFetched> Oh yeah in Comparison, Pat's the prodigy child.
[6:02:19] <%Mornaka> Older brother got all the aggro? @PatStaresAt
[6:02:21] <%trustycoyote> Paige..... that's an old person way of punishing kids.
[6:02:21] <%spiritofmojave> Your brother was the blame incarnate
