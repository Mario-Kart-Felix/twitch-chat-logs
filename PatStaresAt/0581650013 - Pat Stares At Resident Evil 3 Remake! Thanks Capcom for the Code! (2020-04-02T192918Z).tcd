[0:34:51] <adimcorner> feels like a bag of sand

[0:41:38] <coreybom> @captainsaupldin Shes not really upset, just more snarky.
[0:41:41] <Noobasaurus0> In canon, Jill never gets bit
[0:41:44] <%NopeBadguy> @Binary_Fireball bc if she did turn in one bite, there wouldn't really be much of a game
[0:41:44] <%UW_Duncan> Pat you're getting too confident on these roll attempts
[0:41:47] <%zombie_goasts> Binary_Fireball, its called "being a main character in an RE game"
[0:41:48] <%Madbearv> Wait Paige has a job?

[0:43:38] <TyrianPurpleHaze> I suppose what the reasons they can take headshots is that you need to hit the parts of the brain that you need to live, since zombies aren't using the rest.

[0:44:12] <pipboy344> They said there is no original soundtrack dlc because the music is the original stuff reworked

[0:45:02] <CruxAustralis> why did he hide a dot sight instead of cash?
[0:45:04] <TyrianPurpleHaze> I think the thing with infection is just that the infection rate isn't 100% and some people are naturally resistant to it, so the "canon" can be that some people don't get infected even when they're bit once or twice but they aren't flat-out immune.
[0:45:14] <%extradopeness> The ooooolllllllll dick twist
[0:45:15] <Guardiansaiyan> @Hellarussian mansion incident in late august...got bad in september...city starts going really bad in Spetember 25 and the city is fucked starting spetember 28 to 30 when on the 30th it gets nuked
[0:45:19] <myriad_truth> Its a 10 percent immunity

[0:45:55] <Meekest> Some off-screen grinding

[0:46:09] <%MayorRev> what's Paige up to?
[0:46:11] <dreamfillah> Help a Resident Evil ignoramus - when do Re2 and RE3 take place, relative to eacj other
[0:46:14] <+REDtheBEAST> For the day one patch of RE3 they changed the code to 937 cus some people complained about the numbers 918
[0:46:15] <$shaidot> You think you can finish the whole game today?
[0:46:17] <Guardiansaiyan> @Qsmash_ specifiy which ills please
[0:46:17] <Clu_Flynn> T has over 70% mortality and a 3% mortality virus irl was enough to fuck everything up
[0:46:18] <%Dragon_Batman> There was a bobble head sound in there tho
[0:46:22] <Alexisonfires> plays the demo a lot but still forgot about the zombabo thats hiding behind the wall in the alleyway LUL
[0:46:23] <%zombie_goasts> Paige is in her pandemic bubble
[0:46:23] <boogaleeboo> Re3 is one day before and after Re2
[0:46:25] <%tiaramaki> @Swish20XX It was for a while, but I think the REmakes either retconned it or made their own separate canon
[0:46:26] <superchronicc> all the protagonists are blessed with super human genes
[0:46:28] <%SoFarFetched> @MayorRev She's in a phonecall right now.
[0:46:28] <ElemethSigma> If I remember my lore right there were zombie incidents happening in and near Raccoon as far back as July but they were isolated, quickly taken care of and covered up

[0:53:04] <Guardiansaiyan> @myriad_truth 7-11
[0:53:04] <DetroitSentai> It was like that in the demo, if you dont grab the shotgun the cop doesnt spawn in
[0:53:05] <%Dragon_Batman> MAybe it's a shotty trigger in this game
[0:53:05] <graemecrackers2> @PatStaresAt do you like the design of the Nemesis in the second RE film ?
[0:53:06] <boomstickery> @nofestu2 didnt know this game was set in florida
[0:53:07] <Domonomin> priorities
[0:53:07] <+gustavozxd> of course not
[0:53:10] <%NopeBadguy> You gonna fight Nemesis?
[0:53:12] <Everm00r_ind> the hand grenade is in case he lost the key for the shotgun
[0:53:15] <%Ner234> Coward
[0:53:16] <clintonificent> there is no right to own and bear GRENADES bitchhh
[0:53:18] <+Qsmash_> Not speedrunning on your first attempt? whaaaa?
[0:53:18] <megamirk> are there ink ribbons?
[0:53:20] <%thegreenbenis> @myriad_truth You generally can't unless you pay a fucking crazy fee per grenade, like thousands of dollars.
[0:53:23] <oniwahoo> @myriad_truth In America? I'm fairly certain it's full on illegal to own one
[0:53:26] <Fujiwara_92> save then
[0:53:27] <%moogleboy1984> I'm just happy to watch you play it, honestly. Bask in the glory of RE3 my dude.
[0:53:28] <Guardiansaiyan> @PatStaresAt SAVE
[0:53:29] <QaizerArt> SAVE
[0:53:30] <%Dragon_Batman> First playthrough, that is fine
[0:53:30] <myriad_truth> Thats where the bolt cutters were in the demo
[0:53:34] <andresisant> it's nemesis time babe
[0:53:35] <Guardiansaiyan> thanks!
[0:53:36] <theloganbrand> 33 saves
[0:53:40] <$Dakuu75> omg, he picked up the hos all ready?! shit dude, no fear.
[0:53:40] <boogaleeboo> Nah, it's legal to own explosives
[0:53:41] <Darren716> Pretty sure you can own one with a tax stamp
[0:53:44] <theloganbrand> 3/3*
[0:53:44] <%Dragon_Batman> But can you
[0:53:45] <%thegreenbenis> @oniwahoo I don't think it's completely illegal
[0:53:49] <Fujiwara_92> 96 saves
[0:53:55] <%BonewheelVanguard> is the grenade escape still a thing?
[0:53:56] <%D3rrtyD4n> yeah
[0:53:57] <boogaleeboo> You can own a tank, a rocket launcher, whatever isn't an actual wMD
[0:53:57] <clintonificent> this is accurate
[0:53:59] <%marchums> You can totally own hand grenades
[0:53:59] <graemecrackers2> im calling 18 saves in first playthrough
[0:54:00] <myriad_truth> Explosives should be STUPID illegal
[0:54:01] <%Dragon_Batman> I thought so too
[0:54:03] <%spiritofmojave> you'd be surprised, state's can have some whack fucking leniency on explosives I'd bet
[0:54:03] <Darren716> I know you can get 40mm grenade rounds, not fully sure about hand grenades though
[0:54:03] <clintonificent> it was like that in the original too
[0:54:11] <%Dragon_Batman> There is a bobble head in that room I can hear it
[0:54:12] <superchronicc> they can lunge up to 2 times now
[0:54:19] <oniwahoo> @thegreenbenis Yeah, looks like I'm wrong
[0:54:20] <Fujiwara_92> no nemie huh
[0:54:22] <zipfile777> D:
[0:54:25] <adimcorner> probably because the consequence for failure is mu h higher
[0:54:25] <neominigun> man this game already super good
[0:54:28] <%thegreenbenis> You can own a grenade, but you have to pay out the ass, and you'll go to federal prison if they catch you with it.
[0:54:30] <%BoomerUnchained> psaWhat
[0:54:31] <eco419> BibleThump
[0:54:35] <%MonsterEnvy> Yeah but he is going to be a lot more persistent then the zombies.
[0:54:37] <onionfryman> What difficulty is he playing at
[0:54:38] <%doc_ock_rokc> Military grade grenades are illegal
[0:54:39] <+amiroodude> lol Nemesis was a demo exclusive all along
[0:54:39] <GUNxSPECTRE> Jill is Super Operator
[0:54:40] <UvBenServed> Yet
[0:54:40] <Guardiansaiyan> JUST get the hose workign!
[0:54:43] <+A0N33> That cutscene is probably his real introduction
[0:54:46] <clintonificent> i could never dodge zombies consistently in the original but Nemesis i got pretty good at it to the point of getting all Nemesis kills every time I play through the game, zombies are just too unpredictable
[0:54:46] <%SoFarFetched> @onionfryman hardcore
[0:54:47] <DetroitSentai> they probably did that in the demo since it doesnt have the intro scene
[0:54:49] <%marchums> Hes playing on hardcore
[0:54:50] <superchronicc> Nemesis was cut content
[0:54:50] <%WritebroAlpha> DON'T TEMPT FATE PAT

[1:07:55] <clintonificent> CAPCPOM denies you your classic costume!
[1:07:56] <godila2> so much gunpowder
[1:07:57] <Stewbedale> classic outfits don't really suit the new character models anyway
[1:07:59] <sonofthedeepsouth> THE NEETS HAVE INHERETED THE EARTH

[1:08:40] <FrontLineFluffyBunny> here we go
[1:08:41] <+kuervojones> @PatStaresAt Is this game going to be good practice for when Covid-19 eventually mutates?
[1:08:44] <MadDesperado13> Just because a game is long doesn't mean its good
[1:08:45] <+theladyfreeman> Silent Hill looking alleyway.
[1:08:45] <onionfryman> Price down
[1:08:45] <%fetrigon> Would you buy it if it was as bad as RE6
[1:08:46] <sonofthedeepsouth> Those kids are dead

[1:08:52] <%Aracon_> D"
[1:08:53] <clintonificent> so if you don't wanna spend $60 in this trying time than wait for a sale, but if you like short tight games then get it
[1:08:54] <%Aracon_> D:
[1:08:54] <Prophet_v3> 8 hours is pretty short tho for $60
[1:08:55] <TurtleButter> holy shit this music, Deus Ex HR-esque.

[1:08:57] <danknugglit> Thats alot os spaghetti sauce
[1:09:02] <%rumtumtugnutz> @snow_bush I'm employed and taking classes so your estimate is incorrect. You mean hikkikomori. NEET means Not Employed, in Education or training.

[1:09:27] <clintonificent> it might be one of those Ground Zeroes type things where it's "9/10 as a game, but 6/10 as a product"
[1:09:29] <Swish20XX> There is multiplayer this time
[1:09:30] <myriad_truth> In the 90s? M16A2

[1:10:59] <clintonificent> and to be entirely fair, literally every classic survival horror RE is around this length (6-7 hours), if not shorter, its replayability that counts; that being said i totally understand not buying it if you're strapped for cash because like COVID and stuff

[1:30:01] <%Madbearv> it looks like its fun tho
[1:30:02] <%arfsm95> @PatStaresAt what's the difference between using the 2 herbs you got then, or searching around for another one, you're going to use it anyway
[1:30:04] <SLVRBAKSLPZ> Is this an extension of the initial demo??
[1:30:05] <Birdigalore> Maaaan if they had the Majima Everywhere System, but it was Nemesis 10/10
[1:30:07] <myriad_truth> Why would you want to?
[1:30:07] <%stemlo_> "UAGHH"-Jill, opening a door

[1:30:18] <Guyshane> Ammunation
[1:30:18] <+ZedSlayer> COME TO AMMU-NATION
[1:30:19] <clintonificent> which makes sense cuz honestly RE3 didn't even need to be remade, its aged super well even compared to RE2 original
[1:30:19] <CruxAustralis> that's a store in GTA
[1:30:19] <%SoFarFetched> @arfsm95 cause what if he finds a red one
[1:30:21] <+TeddyBrosefvelt> Dumb question, is Pat playing this on normal difficulty?
[1:30:22] <%ShichiNoBushi> Ammu-nation.
[1:30:22] <%D3rrtyD4n> i didnt like the way they showed off nemesis in the demo. this is better so far.
[1:30:22] <%dekkitout> Nems: "Sandwich-chan~!"
[1:30:23] <lionandfox21> RE2 was a love letter to the og in terms of the memory of the player and RE3 is a kick in the ass to the what the world of RE during the outbreak is looks like to those who remeber the og game
[1:30:24] <%Dragon_Batman> They're probably gonna build it and then BAm
[1:30:25] <%BallerSwagBro9k> GTA?

[1:31:18] <%TheSphereHunter> the music playing is a remixed track from the original it's insane
[1:31:20] <R3c0n31> Why are there so many grenades in this city?
[1:31:21] <%Binary_Fireball> is the hand grenade a defensive weapon?

[1:31:39] <Zebroneath> There's a lot more ambient music in RE3-make, I'm noticing.
[1:31:40] <FrontLineFluffyBunny> for now
[1:31:40] <+RPG_CHICAGO> @TheSphereHunter all the little bits of old music is great
[1:31:43] <%j0ustar> What chat, you've never found a grenade in your local donut shop?

[1:32:02] <SomeAsianDood> @dekkitout they are. I've had some before
[1:32:03] <$ggbhtg> At this point, it's reverse Crazy Talk to mention Nemesis
[1:32:03] <%코코꾸라> @j0ustar I know, right? How do they think donut holes are made with?
[1:32:06] <+Grayhammatter> the safety dance

[1:32:18] <%BallerSwagBro9k> psaCrazyhand psaCrazyhead
[1:32:18] <dreu81> Every time you avoid the front door of the donut shop he just feels left out
[1:32:18] <$shaidot> !uptime
[1:32:18] <R3c0n31> Que the death cycle of pat dying to Nemesis
[1:32:19] <@Moobot> I've been playing this game for how long? Oh only 1h 32m.
[1:32:19] <%Binary_Fireball> just juke him out of his shoes
[1:32:20] <CrazyMedicine> Crazy talk activated
[1:32:20] <Birdigalore> "I'm not too worried about Nemesis" Crazy Talk primed
[1:32:21] <YakumoYomi> Now he's done it...
[1:32:21] <Crimpson> He thinks the same about you
[1:32:21] <%tiaramaki> Calling psaCrazyhead right now
[1:32:21] <myriad_truth> You get stuff if you kill him!!
[1:32:22] <%BoomerUnchained> Hits cost resources

[1:32:22] <S4boar> oh snap, wasn't expecting it so soon
[1:32:23] <jellssssss20> Do you get anything from defeating nemesis? Can you?
[1:32:23] <Jordan_z123> LUL
[1:32:23] <SivSarcast> The flamethrower just looks clumsy TBH.
[1:32:24] <%Dragon_Batman> Nemesis will probably act as the Crazy Talk in that scenario
[1:32:25] <%croxeye> @dukenux physical shipment supply issues unfortaantely, game is pretty much done but there's a whole mess of manufacturing and shipping issues and this may impact the whole gaming industry as well
[1:32:25] <%yourliteraldog> That looked more like a drunken stumble
[1:32:26] <$ggbhtg> I said it's REVERSE CRAZY TALK at this point, chat!
[1:32:27] <+BubbaRands> Crazy Talk: He goes down in one shot
[1:32:27] <Mexrage> don't know...this game could end up turning...into a "nighmare" later on
[1:32:28] <ThespianBarrage> Sounds EZ
[1:32:28] <%GabeSweetMan> Damn I was HOPING he'd BURST out of a wall just then.

[1:32:34] <FrontLineFluffyBunny> watch his moves and timing been completly difernat from the demo
[1:32:36] <%TheSphereHunter> I think they got a lot of complaints about RE2's standard mode too so that affected this game's difficulty.
[1:32:36] <myriad_truth> NEMY GIVES ITEM DROPS!
[1:32:36] <shiny_prinny> charging up that crazy talk
[1:32:37] <disister1201> there are higher difficulty settings than hardcore

[1:32:38] <%Picia000123> kinda shame the shiv just stays on and the QTEs are back, managing shivs in RE2R was fun

[2:06:00] <@Moobot> I've been playing this game for how long? Oh only 2h 6m.
[2:06:00] <ElemethSigma> Yeah the Hunter line of BOW's are one of the more successful Umbrella products
[2:06:01] <+akira_chong> @PadreHail It's true, but honestly, you could retool it so that Code Veronica is like RE4 but for Claire. Or they could ACTUALLY combine the stories and have Chris in YUROP.
[2:06:01] <%shiplord13> Hence why Huntes a were the most widely used
[2:06:02] <FG_Leo106> Hey Pat! are you enjoying the game so far?
[2:06:06] <BillieNoMates> But there was already a mine thrower in 3
[2:06:06] <$ggbhtg> RIP Blizzaga Rounds
[2:06:11] <silenthillbookofmammaries> ICE IS COOLER THAN ACID
[2:06:11] <dukenux> well, neither you can control anthraz, but
[2:06:13] <BillieNoMates> Ruined my game canon :*
[2:06:15] <+Mendin> Was that a G Blob?
[2:06:16] <+Mugen4552> "nerf the ice rounds"-Capcom
[2:06:16] <Mexrage> is the reason why Hunters were so popular for Umbrella and post Umbrella bioterrorists, they can follow orders @PatStaresAt
[2:06:17] <a_mad_dragon> MOUNDS of shit
[2:06:17] <Torgue_1> Whose rounds?
[2:06:18] <jcflyguy> But how will you kick Nemesis' ass without ice roun- oh wait
[2:06:18] <SivSarcast> They didn't want to make Nemesis to easy to beat I guess, so no ice?
[2:06:19] <clintonificent> i wish it was flame-acid-freeze-mine but oh whale its not a big deal
[2:06:20] <eco419> BabyRage
[2:06:20] <+Grayhammatter> big ol nasty
[2:06:21] <TurtlesAndTentacles> The fuck is a Mine round?
[2:06:23] <%king_wragles> @silenthillbookofmammaries hah, I get it.
[2:06:23] <%MayorRev> Ice is cool tho!
[2:06:25] <$lotharrio> It's like the general from Jurassic World who is obsessed with the idea of weaponizing raptors. He tries it and then gets murdered by them instantly.
[2:06:25] <StarlitStunner> brucegShades Sewer
[2:06:26] <theangryguyofde> imagine a Hunter that greets you like a dog
[2:06:26] <%croxeye> Ice Rounds where SUPER OP in OG so that's probably why they took them out
[2:06:28] <Daniel_Is_I> Two grenades.
[2:06:28] <+REDtheBEAST> well this confirms no Minethrower...
[2:06:29] <+ZedSlayer> wow

[2:06:45] <%Dementedpenguin> *of
[2:06:50] <%stemlo_> If a "swallow whole" animation starts playing, I am O U T
[2:06:51] <Daniel_Is_I> But Nemesis doesn't stay down

[2:11:18] <jellssssss20> I love that yellow tape that Umbrella invented
[2:11:19] <%tusk102> @lotharrio admittedly at least their weakness is only exposed during an attack versus the tyrants who have a massive eyeball weakspot

[2:14:33] <%tusk102> @PatStaresAt they're cute in a pug way where they're deformed looking somehow cute
[2:14:34] <%yourliteraldog> I imagine Umbrella is like Space X where the value of the company comes from the ultra-wealthy but emotionally stunted investors. Rather than any tangible product.
[2:14:34] <black_pariah> dont agree but i see where you might

[2:16:12] <ThespianBarrage> It's a pull door Jill, not a push.... pull!
[2:16:14] <rufus2k2> huh
[2:16:22] <%Bane_Kaikyo> You need timestop to open that door
[2:16:24] <$Ziegsy> Day 6 In my corvid bed! Enjoying the stream and a fuck load of candy as ordered. Also cracked open secret of mana for the first time.
[2:16:25] <+Kduff89> more like a light jog
[2:16:29] <%tusk102> @PatStaresAt how many attachments are on that pistol rn???
[2:16:34] <heartlesshealer> kinda
[2:16:35] <%Brojira> Brojira subscribed at Tier 1. They've subscribed for 3 months! 
[2:16:35] <%Dragon_Batman> Yea it does look like there was like 2 upgrades on the pistol since I left
[2:16:36] <majindusto> No?
[2:16:39] <+MeatBomb> Pet that EMO !
[2:16:40] <HyperBomb21> ?????
[2:16:41] <sexdrugsvideogames> no
[2:16:42] <Deadbulky> No
[2:16:42] <%DesuDesuDokiDoki> 3
[2:16:42] <rufus2k2> do the leon krauser backstory!
[2:16:42] <clintonificent> yeah its pretty segmented compared to the other REs
[2:16:44] <Tiewolf> 3
[2:16:47] <Tiewolf> maybe 4
[2:16:49] <%tusk102> wowie
[2:16:51] <rufus2k2> release it from its Darkside Chronicles prison!
[2:16:51] <black_pariah> how much have you optimized your run buy grabbing those upgrades
[2:16:52] <%trustycoyote> .... not following what you said
[2:16:54] <+Kduff89> dont pet emo's they get mad
[2:16:57] <boomstickery> just a stock left and its a carbine
[2:16:57] <FG_Leo106> i like this one because it more straight forward, has less filler too
[2:16:58] <FutaSnek> JUST LIKE RE6 Kappa
[2:16:58] <%THATGUY_789> The Resident Evil Novellas
[2:17:00] <Mexrage> yeah, it seems to be more "stage" based
[2:17:00] <brambobelurkin> psaBlep
[2:17:04] <%Dementedpenguin> Isn't that re6?
[2:17:04] <TheArrow_> you mean levels?
[2:17:04] <MrDoomtastic44> @Ziegsy dang, get well, bud
[2:17:06] <BillieNoMates> Would a gamma ttry and eat a G mutant or would it just be hentai that no man should ever witness?
[2:17:11] <boomstickery> @PatStaresAt early in the game yet
[2:17:11] <DeebzNutz100> RE:RE 3
[2:17:12] <%Aracon_> it's just set piece to set piece
[2:17:13] <+calvinf10> can we get a stock, drum mag, and a sniper scope please
[2:17:17] <Deadbulky> So just levels...
[2:17:18] <BritishTyrannosaur> the end pd the game is a reimagining of darkside chronicles calling it now
[2:17:19] <eco419> last one was dead space :)
[2:17:19] <%D3rrtyD4n> so its very linear?
[2:17:21] <%trustycoyote> Oh! Compartmentalized? @PatStaresAt
[2:17:25] <R3c0n31> i predict thatll happen
[2:17:26] <%THATGUY_789> 3Make
[2:17:27] <Zebroneath> autosave....
[2:17:27] <+REDtheBEAST> The game is forcing you forwards.
[2:17:28] <Shishi1205> big loading
[2:17:30] <%Dragon_Batman> Like little sandboxes ?
[2:17:32] <%hahaha1171> oh boy
[2:17:34] <clintonificent> RE3 had a very weird progression system in the original, it did not match the RE1/RE2 mansion-guardhouse-mansion-sewers-lab
[2:17:37] <$ggbhtg> Nem senses tingling
[2:17:40] <%D3rrtyD4n> oh shit
[2:17:41] <$ggbhtg> or that
[2:17:46] <bendatron> Whats the point for the silencer
[2:17:48] <+Cowboy_Static> @PatStaresAt would it be a good idea to remake RE4?
[2:17:48] <lionandfox21> oh nice
[2:17:50] <+Kduff89> big direct hit
[2:17:52] <clintonificent> this one actually makes it more similar to that, but you don't get to backtrack to previous stages like in those ones
[2:17:53] <%D3rrtyD4n> it didnt like that
[2:17:53] <SomeOtherNeb> he hates it
[2:17:54] <sexdrugsvideogames> so cute
[2:17:56] <FutaSnek> Was a tad low
[2:17:57] <rufus2k2> crisp y boy
[2:17:58] <dashmatt> nailed it
[2:18:01] <CherrieVelvet> bit too low
[2:18:01] <+PadreHail> BAHNING
[2:18:01] <BritishTyrannosaur> Hunter can have a little jill as a treat
[2:18:02] <+Grayhammatter> nice crazy talk
[2:18:03] <%tusk102> @PatStaresAt chapters? oh you mean like the hit classic Resident Evil game Resident Evil 6 Kappa
[2:18:04] <%Dragon_Batman> Looked like it but hey it works
[2:18:04] <+ZedSlayer> bbq frogg
[2:18:06] <FG_Leo106> Also this game is more of a Reimagining or RE3, not a Remake but still is pretty good imo
[2:18:06] <CruxAustralis> this is also flame round
[2:18:07] <%D3rrtyD4n> it is
[2:18:08] <%tiaramaki> @BillieNoMates I think the presence of G Spawn in RE2make might indicate that the Gammas got rekt by the Spawn. Unless they ate the larvae and mutated as a result.
[2:18:08] <Dr_Mooose> crispy
[2:18:09] <boomstickery> @PatStaresAt sequisha is playing this like you do and he's been streaming it for almost 24 hours
[2:18:12] <%solzan2000> weak to fire I guess
[2:18:13] <CruxAustralis> not explosive
[2:18:15] <clintonificent> FROGGO
[2:18:15] <+ZedSlayer> cripsey
[2:18:15] <YakumoYomi> One hundred MILLION percent
[2:18:17] <dashmatt> literally shakes it off
[2:18:18] <%Dragon_Batman> Nice ups buddy
[2:18:18] <clintonificent> he shake!
[2:18:20] <+Grayhammatter> big crispy boy
[2:18:22] <sexdrugsvideogames> maybe randomized damage
[2:18:23] <%InugamiTheHound> so its more like dead space 1 and 2, small areas that locked off from each other unless the story demands you backtrack?
[2:18:25] <+Kduff89> this is not as forgiving as the cacodemons
[2:18:30] <FutaSnek> They bob alot so its hard to get it dead centre
[2:18:31] <majindusto> BIG JUMP
[2:18:33] <%D3rrtyD4n> nice
[2:18:34] <%tusk102> OH NICE
[2:18:34] <Deadbulky> This seems like the easiest Resi game
[2:18:34] <$ggbhtg> WOW
[2:18:36] <%DesuDesuDokiDoki> oh
[2:18:37] <+Grayhammatter> oh... nice
[2:18:38] <%D3rrtyD4n> good to know
[2:18:38] <+MeatBomb> THAD LOWE
[2:18:38] <%Dementedpenguin> Jill's gonna need a long shower after this.

[2:18:40] <Mexrage> 1 HP left
[2:18:40] <tubit> welp
[2:18:42] <abuse_of_juice> Pog
[2:18:42] <%THATGUY_789> Did everyone in Raccoon City get dysentery?
[2:18:45] <megakruemel> "OH Nooo~ My weakpoiiiint~"
[2:18:46] <Tiewolf> Next time shot them in the belly
[2:18:46] <whitevalkyries26> they have little chicken wings
[2:18:46] <+ZedSlayer> magic pixel
[2:18:47] <+Kduff89> JILL
[2:18:47] <%tusk102> just one pistol shot
[2:18:50] <Dio_TR> RELOAD
[2:18:52] <jellssssss20> Does focussing still increase damage?
[2:18:53] <rufus2k2> upgrade pistol workin
[2:18:54] <FutaSnek> Magic Pixel LUL
[2:18:55] <DetroitSentai> doesnt even matter if the flame doesnt kill
[2:18:56] <theloganbrand> Gaiden in RE engine when?
[2:18:58] <clintonificent> chicken frog
[2:18:59] <sexdrugsvideogames> next time use the knife
[2:18:59] <$ggbhtg> don't worry, those shotgun rounds were DEFINITELY not a waste, mind goblins
[2:19:00] <Jimevera> Maybe even a knife stab might do them in
[2:19:00] <%GabeSweetMan> Butterball Monsters
[2:19:02] <FutaSnek> BAT ER Y
[2:19:03] <%tusk102> @PatStaresAt they're cute in the deformed pug way?
[2:19:03] <rufus2k2> they look like a bloodborne enemy
[2:19:04] <clintonificent> Brad "Chickenfrog" Vickers
[2:19:07] <+Grayhammatter> battery
[2:19:07] <myriad_truth> UNTIL THEY EAT YOU!
[2:19:08] <eco419> awww baby is holding Pat
[2:19:09] <%NopeBadguy> I can't believe my bioweapon is this cute
[2:19:11] <+Ell1ot> maybe no one is a zombie and everyone has food poisoning
[2:19:12] <%doc_ock_rokc> Impossible percentage....Damn it now I have to listen to 99.9 again
[2:19:13] <lionandfox21> are we all freaks for liking the ew gamma design>
[2:19:13] <mirainousagi> I love the burned effect it gives them with the flame round
[2:19:13] <%GabeSweetMan> I bet those Hunters are fucking delicious.
[2:19:16] <%hahaha1171> i want them as a plushy
[2:19:19] <dukenux> they remind me of Burricks from Thief
[2:19:20] <+BubbaRands> boom
[2:19:21] <clintonificent> wow that's more Hunter Gammas than the original game
[2:19:22] <DeebzNutz100> chicken legs and frog wings
[2:19:24] <+PadreHail> Gamma: GAH MY BREADSTIIICKS
[2:19:25] <dukenux> or those things in Morrowind

[2:19:29] <sexdrugsvideogames> knife
[2:19:30] <%tusk102> @PatStaresAt they remind me of blobfish
[2:19:33] <FutaSnek> That was close
[2:19:34] <R3c0n31> yea worth
[2:19:35] <HyperBomb21> These guys remind me of those blackdragons from the Dark Souls 2 DLC.
[2:19:37] <%IKilledADeadGuy> Gamma buffalo wings
[2:19:37] <Deadbulky> Such a threat ResidentSleeper
[2:19:38] <%Omegaanimus> what if frogs had wings???
[2:19:38] <+ZedSlayer> hardcore
[2:19:38] <clintonificent> Hunter Gammas only showed up in two areas in original RE3 its wild
[2:19:41] <%Shady_Squid> Poor babies.
[2:19:41] <Nupinoop296> how many did they smuggle out of the labs?
[2:19:42] <HyperBomb21> They were two legged and hid a big mouth
[2:19:44] <%Breaknoon> chicken legs and frog wings? sounds kinda good
[2:19:45] <rufus2k2> @doc_ock_rokc "yeah, you're done."

[2:19:54] <+Mendin> Shortcut porn unlocked
[2:19:55] <reinbachthe3rd> Crimson Heads back?
[2:19:56] <clintonificent> and one was confined to RNG so you could go through a playthrough and only see gammas once
[2:19:56] <megakruemel> gib pouch
[2:19:58] <eco419> Kreygasm
[2:20:01] <%Dragon_Batman> You probably gotta shortcut it to get it back

[2:20:28] <black_pariah> ***
[2:20:28] <heartlesshealer> that's a tall order, Pat
[2:20:28] <killrbumpkin> Hey Pat and chat HeyGuys
[2:20:29] <DetroitSentai> what if you take the battery out when the door is open?
[2:20:30] <%ledgefiendd> how long has pat been streaming?

[2:20:31] <dan_g_v> best nemesis bloopers you said?
[2:20:32] <%j0ustar> Jill you... you couldn't fit your hand through the bars for that baby lock?.... Jill...
[2:20:32] <+Mugen4552> @PatStaresAt I made one you didn't care...
[2:20:34] <dashmatt> SHE COULD JUST REACH IN AND UNLOCK THAT SHIT
[2:20:36] <%doc_ock_rokc> TOO BAD YOU GET BLOOPERS
[2:20:37] <This_is_Marco> Wheres the one he gets eaten by zombo?
[2:20:38] <jellssssss20> Scrub all successful clips!
[2:20:40] <AdmiralButtloaf> That looked like a potato bomb lol
[2:20:42] <TurtleButter> game is going by at a breakneck pace.
[2:20:43] <%THATGUY_789> you failing Pat is your strongest selling point
[2:20:43] <%tusk102> @dashmatt no shut up tho
[2:20:45] <+Mendin> Gunpowdr next to the coffee machine, you say
[2:20:47] <+Ell1ot> the best we can do is you looking super cool then eating shit right after
[2:20:47] <rufus2k2> nothing in the duffel bag? come on
[2:20:48] <SivSarcast> SHUSH. IT'S VIDEO GAME LOGIC
[2:20:53] <dan_g_v> aaah coffee
[2:20:55] <+ZedSlayer> poozley
[2:20:56] <+REDtheBEAST> i really hat this design...i see that they went to route of combining the Hunter Gammas and the gravedigger into one enemy...
[2:21:02] <%DesuDesuDokiDoki> DELETE ALL SUCCESSFUL CLIPS
[2:21:03] <theangryguyofde> 75% done the game by pouch progression
[2:21:05] <Dio_TR> YOU CAN DO A COMPILATION OF YOU SAYING "HELLO" TO EVERYTHING
[2:21:05] <Guardiansaiyan> OOOPS all embarrassing
[2:21:06] <+ZedSlayer> yeah i miss gravedigger
[2:21:06] <%MalekDracarus> Does it add a pouch to her outfit?
[2:21:08] <%ledgefiendd> has nemesis broken into a safe room? is it real?
[2:21:08] <%THATGUY_789> no one wants successful Pat
[2:21:08] <BillieNoMates> Have we seen the graboid yet?
[2:21:09] <rufus2k2> a cup of joe with a sprinkle of cordite to jumpstart my day
[2:21:09] <+PadreHail> Can't wait for Pat to get to *that* part
[2:21:13] <%doc_ock_rokc> @rufus2k2 nothing that will help you survive
[2:21:14] <BritishTyrannosaur> but what if you make a hot cup og hunpowder by accident?
[2:21:14] <eco419> LUL
[2:21:27] <%tusk102> @PatStaresAt the reason the gunpowder is next to the coffee is so the workers make more murder machines LUL
[2:21:29] <+Kduff89> I mean they are in a sewer so I think they are always eating shit
[2:21:32] <FutaSnek> "gets vored"
[2:21:33] <TopTierHarley> this isn't resistance NotLikeThis
[2:21:34] <heartlesshealer> box <3
[2:21:37] <rufus2k2> @BritishTyrannosaur how do you think Barry burton got so big
[2:21:39] <dan_g_v> then you drink you gunpowder coffee
[2:21:43] <portalmaster112> hi pat
[2:21:45] <%chiluzza> why didnt you just break the glass and picked up the bag from outside
[2:21:48] <+Mugen4552> @ledgefiendd he can't do that but he sticks around in the area for a bit if you hide in them
[2:21:51] <sexdrugsvideogames> bulletproof coffee
[2:21:54] <YakumoYomi> No ammo issues thus far?
[2:21:58] <BritishTyrannosaur> All coming together
[2:21:59] <%Madbearv> its the dodge
[2:22:02] <SivSarcast> Acid Coffee?
[2:22:03] <Swish20XX> Or you're better
[2:22:03] <%doc_ock_rokc> If it isn't gunpowder herbs or pouches its not worth it
[2:22:05] <Birdigalore> Yeah you said that before...THEN DEMOS
[2:22:06] <+ZedSlayer> a bit more linear too
[2:22:06] <FutaSnek> Is it suppost to be cause Jills a fuckin badass?
[2:22:06] <eco419> ez
[2:22:07] <%ledgefiendd> @Mugen4552 ahhhh okay. thanks!
[2:22:08] <dan_g_v> well Jill is a badass
[2:22:10] <+Elite_Tube> It's the dogdge
[2:22:10] <TopTierHarley> Pat turning into Cell
[2:22:10] <%Madbearv> the dodge is a direct upgrade
[2:22:10] <DetroitSentai> Well RE3 was a bit more of an action game to begin with eh?
[2:22:10] <dukenux> Is there a harder than Hardcore difficulty?
[2:22:11] <+Kduff89> You get danger after one hit from nemi tho
[2:22:13] <%Picia000123> the dodge makes it trivial
[2:22:13] <%Aracon_> yeah in RE2 you would've died like 30 times by now
[2:22:14] <Meekest> I keep waiting for Leon or Claire to show up and fuck RE2's timeline more
[2:22:15] <+PadreHail> Hunter Gammas are modeled after Barry and his lust for sandwiches
[2:22:17] <%Dragon_Batman> It also might be cuz your more experienced as well
[2:22:21] <%THATGUY_789> this game is full of fetish
[2:22:21] <Mexrage> there is a reason for it being easier than RE2 remake on hardcore =P
[2:22:22] <megakruemel> my youtube account i use to comment is named gunpowdercoffee
[2:22:23] <FrontLineFluffyBunny> STARS!!!
[2:22:24] <%tusk102> @PatStaresAt that dodge is kickass
[2:22:26] <silverira> @PatStaresAt they are giving a LOT of ammo
[2:22:28] <+ZedSlayer> too quiet
[2:22:32] <eco419> trap
[2:22:32] <Deadbulky> Like Nemsiis dies to one nade
[2:22:32] <dan_g_v> it's easy "immediately gets killed
[2:22:35] <+ZedSlayer> wheres nemmy
[2:22:37] <%poker4121> i find it funny that the lock is outside, could imagine someone being a jerk and yanking the battery.
[2:22:39] <%herecomesmong0> do a no box run then
[2:22:39] <FrontLineFluffyBunny> you also spent a ton of time learning nemesis
[2:22:39] <Meekest> Just wait til Jill ALSO drops a crane on Birkin
[2:22:40] <%THATGUY_789> Pat the Wise
[2:22:40] <delta0093> pat did you get s rank on hardcore re2?
[2:22:43] <%1buckboom> The dodge probably helps a ton with the difficulty as well.

[2:31:33] <+PadreHail> Wha Woolie doesn't know who Nemesis is
[2:31:35] <FrontLineFluffyBunny> check case
[2:31:36] <$spardanwarrior> It's a DMC2 stinger though.
[2:31:38] <+Estuko> @President_Miyazaki it even has the slow but hard stop LUL

[2:31:46] <+PadreHail> Hyuck hyuck hyuck
[2:31:46] <mrjplays2k9> I wanna show this fight to anyone that thinks this game is bad
[2:31:46] <Gr4ndm4rsh4ll> Nemesis is playing a character action game while you’re playing survival horror
[2:31:47] <SivSarcast> "Defeat the creature". 2/10 didn't say "Defeat the monster"
[2:31:48] <+rooked4> Just do some pokes in the neutral game, then do combo
[2:31:49] <heartlesshealer> HORB
[2:31:51] <masterfire23> ultra nemistinct
[2:31:55] <%MonsieurHedge> @silverira it reduces your score
[2:31:56] <+MeatBomb> woolieTRASH HahaTurtledove
[2:31:59] <dukenux> It say "the creature". Does the game ever use the name "Nemesis"?
[2:31:59] <heartlesshealer> yay he finally saw
[2:32:00] <boomstickery> go the eye doctor pat
[2:32:03] <+PadreHail> Nemesis is still in MvC3
[2:32:03] <eco419> herb here
[2:32:03] <%GabeSweetMan> @silverira But what if he needs it later?!
[2:32:06] <+chase959> I love that he is just wrapped in flex tape, because what else could take all those grenade rounds
[2:32:06] <silverira> oh fuck off
[2:32:07] <YakumoYomi> Nemesis trained under Benimaru Shinmon
[2:32:09] <%doc_ock_rokc> @SivSarcast it can weild a gun. its not a monster
[2:32:10] <$Corporate_Redeemer> Nemmy's been doing some work in the LAB
[2:32:15] <clintonificent> million stab
[2:32:16] <FrontLineFluffyBunny> @PatStaresAt check the giant briefcase?
[2:32:16] <%Binary_Fireball> maybe just try talking to him
[2:32:17] <boomstickery> theres alsoa box over there

[2:32:28] <+PadreHail> NEMESIS HAS HITBOXES TURNED ON
[2:32:29] <%Jekado> lets try to get Nemmy-chan trending!
[2:32:33] <rosemon5001> can you try to shoot the weapon in its glowy parts when it reloads i know it says fuel tank but you never know
[2:32:34] <R3c0n31> Do Crits make bigger holes in his Barrell?
[2:32:35] <+ZedSlayer> this music reminds me of G fight music a bit too
[2:32:36] <godila2> what if he has judgement cut too monkaS
[2:32:41] <silverira> goblin NEEDS to HOARD!
[2:32:42] <clintonificent> judgement cut end
[2:32:44] <%Tyndarian> you can do it nemmy-chan
[2:32:47] <+ZedSlayer> i wouldnt try it
[2:32:48] <+amiroodude> Can't believe Pat has nearly beaten the game
[2:32:49] <FutaSnek> Real talk tho thats a good ass tank that thing takes like 30 bullets
[2:32:52] <+Mugen4552> if he high times you in to a million stab you should send Capcom a clip of it.
[2:32:53] <%THATGUY_789> just add more fire
[2:32:54] <%GabeSweetMan> Probably?
[2:32:54] <%InugamiTheHound> remember wooolie didn't know nemesis even after playing mvc3
[2:32:55] <+Estuko> It just heals him instead LUL

[3:02:13] <Naesyroc> I wonder if you can shoot the rockets like in the old game

[3:35:23] <FrontLineFluffyBunny> marvin fixes it!
[3:35:24] <Wolfstriker121> This legit lore
[3:35:26] <GrandmasterBFunk> MARVIN RESTOCKS IT DUH
[3:35:27] <superchronicc> you can also unlock the other locker near by
[3:35:28] <Hydrapissed> nemisis put them back on its fine
[3:35:29] <LokimenD> HISTORY ABHORS A PARADOX
[3:35:29] <Mexrage> i mean...claire and leon already time paradox themselves
[3:35:30] <%toolofparanoia> IT WAS ME ALL ALONG
[3:35:31] <auraofdawn> i wanted it to be Nemesis :(
[3:35:31] <+RenoDeGeneric> No one ever picks up stuff in cannon
[3:35:32] <brad0war> No portable safe?
[3:35:32] <%spiritofmojave> You're just creating more work for poor Marv
[3:35:33] <myriad_truth> Leon and Claire get it at the SAME TIME
[3:35:33] <%Shadicara> Carlos is the true weilder of the monado guys he can change the future Kappa
[3:35:33] <%Fien111> Ada clearly went back through and replaced all the shit you take, Pat
[3:35:34] <+calvinf10> Is marvin still alive rn
[3:35:34] <Birdigalore> Nah Marvin did a sweep of the RPD and reset things for shits and giggles
[3:35:35] <C24U> Marv restocked the place
[3:35:35] <$galaxyswirl> so wait chat, did pat miss the easteregg or is this a one guy???
[3:35:35] <megakruemel> is the flash grenade a safe item?
[3:35:35] <Alseid> I guess just like getting bit, these puzzle solves DIDN'T HAPPEN
[3:35:35] <R3c0n31> Pat is stealing from Leon
[3:35:36] <TurtlesAndTentacles> Leon B remember
[3:35:36] <%bread_assassin> Carlos, you caused a time paradox.
[3:35:37] <%Deft_Thought> PIME TARADOX
[3:35:39] <dukenux> Marvin just goes around and fixes it
[3:35:39] <+Mitchellsocks> RE2make was already an internal time paradox
[3:35:39] <%shiplord13> @PatStaresAt Marvin willr estock
[3:35:40] <%spiritofmojave> he can barely limp to each place
[3:35:41] <IlGodot> you thought it was Nemesis but it was me, Carlos
[3:35:42] <%tusk102> @PatStaresAt marvin just goes around the whole station its fine
[3:35:42] <DetroitSentai> canon nobody picks up non key items
[3:35:42] <Spiralpower1620> Might as well kill ocelot then
[3:35:44] <Tagwaggin> in canon everyone is speed running
[3:35:44] <%hahaha1171> Mr x puts the stuff back
[3:35:46] <%ledgefiendd> just wait for the back-half where you put everything back for leon
[3:35:47] <dan_g_v> did you stuff a corpse a there too?
[3:35:48] <+thepowerofpinsol> Its a temporal pair of socks
[3:35:50] <%professormorrigan> It's a paradox, Raziel. IT'S ALL A PARADOX
[3:35:51] <%Fien111> alternatively, WESKER'S BEHIND IT ALL
[3:35:52] <+Anonymasque> Leon will die because there were no items.

And she can be,"Lady Who Swears in the Kitchen" with, "I'M TRYING YOU MAKE YOU SOME FUCKING DINNER!!", "AH FUCKING SHITBALLS!", "DO YOU WANT TO FUCKING EAT OR NOT?". Bet Pat feels quite lucky having a theatre lady who's good at playing both roles.

[4:08:58] <stabbityrabbit> Turns out you need to give Nemesis a water stone to make him evolve.
[4:08:59] <Mexrage> now we need a MHW x RE3 event when we fight Beast Nemesis
[4:09:00] <jase__x> this kinda feels placed out of nowhere

[4:36:22] <thelasthoxhaist> carlos best caracter
[4:36:28] <%tusk102> thats true
[4:36:30] <hhomura> walking takes time, chat
[4:36:30] <%RyanTheRecluse> So is Jill resistant to umbrella viruses now?
[4:36:32] <+thackattack00> How did he know she was infected just by looking at her
[4:36:34] <takokasa> Not to mention it's a city filled with zambos
[4:36:37] <%stemlo_> I didn't expect to like Carlos
[4:36:37] <%Shadicara> Carlos is such a chad
[4:36:39] <%spiritofmojave> WHY'S CARLOS SO HOT
[4:36:41] <%stemlo_> But I do
[4:36:41] <Zebroneath> Carlos better come back as a character now.
[4:36:42] <%spiritofmojave> stop it
[4:36:42] <%Dragon_Batman> You going to the hopsital with her?
[4:36:43] <%ammobasket> and SEARCH IT
[4:36:43] <%doc_ock_rokc> Walk from one end of newyork to the other without getting close to people
[4:36:44] <Dio_TR> HOW THE FUCK IS JILL NOT A ZOMBIE BY NOW
[4:36:44] <%Aracon_> I'm surprised she's even still alive
[4:36:44] <+Bloody_Stump> !uptime
[4:36:45] <bxdragon> That man has awesome hair
[4:36:45] <@Moobot> I've been playing this game for how long? Oh only 4h 36m.
[4:36:47] <hhomura> @thackattack00 he just knew LUL
[4:36:48] <%Aracon_> let alone not infected
[4:36:49] <%Niney_Who> SPENCER
[4:36:49] <+Pookiedaexzile> THE BIG HOLE IN HER ARM
[4:36:49] <%tusk102> @PatStaresAt she was also in some bullshit random spot in this apparently new york cized city
[4:36:49] <%jinking79> well Nemesis body is gone
[4:36:50] <%Dragon_Batman> Neat
[4:36:52] <Fujiwara_92> I LOVE CARLOS <3
[4:36:53] <venomfury86> no instant virus?
[4:36:54] <BritishTyrannosaur> their is a file near the start that says some people are resistant
[4:36:55] <%GabeSweetMan> Carlos! Carlos! Carlos!
[4:36:55] <clintonificent> I'm sure this Hospital will be safe, and no Huntars
[4:36:56] <Grandma_Amari> The hospital's remarkably clean considering what's happening
[4:36:56] <+RICE02> Carlos is too hot. Engine barely can handle him
[4:36:57] <circular7> too bad Carlos never came back in the series
[4:36:58] <star_feline> wouldn't this place be FUCKED with zombies?
[4:36:58] <%tiaramaki> Oh, so the Clock Tower place is just all gone now?
[4:36:59] <+necrocannibal2> SHUT UP NERD
[4:37:02] <Guardiansaiyan> @PatStaresAt it said AM
[4:37:03] <ScreamLord> @PatStaresAt Sharry tells me that Jill should have gotten sick virus powers after she gets the vaccine
[4:37:04] <Dio_TR> IT TOOK BRAD MINUTES
[4:37:06] <Dr_Mooose> more Carlos
[4:37:06] <%optimasmaximas> you think we'll hear the helicopter crash?
[4:37:08] <%tusk102> @PatStaresAt no clocktower at all huh?
[4:37:08] <%MonsieurHedge> was that subtitle wrong?
[4:37:08] <moosemonkey397> vaccines arent cures tho
[4:37:09] <%DesuDesuDokiDoki> fight the zambambos
[4:37:09] <+GenesisKnight> Check her pockets
[4:37:10] <Monkeyweed21> Did you not see all that blood?
[4:37:13] <%Aracon_> the power of boner compels you carlos
[4:37:13] <+Trabnaxes> But what about the mysterious 4th survivor? Where was he?
[4:37:13] <CptVolkow> Zombrex time
[4:37:14] <%Hellarussian> is Cahlos baybee
[4:37:17] <+xerotwo> CARLOS PogChamp
[4:37:17] <%spiritofmojave> @RICE02 it's true LUL
[4:37:17] <Birdigalore> IT'S CARLOS TIME -no ammo-
[4:37:17] <%doc_ock_rokc> Vaccine?! She needs ANTIBODIES
[4:37:17] <YaiGameworks> Time for the best section of the game.
[4:37:18] <reonome> sexy infected moans
[4:37:19] <+the_drummaestro> wait a vaccine doesn't do shit if she's infected no?
[4:37:19] <@commanderclaw> My least favorite line in action movies is "Use your willpower to fight this poison"
[4:37:20] <Guardiansaiyan> @PatStaresAt they arrive the NIGHT OF Spetember 29
[4:37:20] <RevolverBobkat> Why do they still call it a vaccine? They could have called it a cure this time
[4:37:20] <Fujiwara_92> Jill prompt
[4:37:24] <TwinBat> get the vacccine, save us all carlos
[4:37:24] <+PR0swagonist> How is this hospital not fucked up
[4:37:27] <Cleric4gg> No moppy dialogue from Jill?
[4:37:28] <megakruemel> wait isn't raccoon city about to get nuked?
[4:37:28] <%valriot> Carlos gotta get those tacos
[4:37:28] <star_feline> Time to take all Jill's shit
[4:37:29] <hhomura> good thing those jill noises won't be in any sfm movies anytime soon
[4:37:30] <%Hellarussian> loot
[4:37:32] <clintonificent> yea clocktowers gone unfortunately but they expand the sections after this a lot
[4:37:33] <missingangle> STEAL
[4:37:35] <$lotharrio> Chuckles over here.
[4:37:36] <Deadbulky> Use knife on her
[4:37:36] <%professormorrigan> oh no
[4:37:36] <thelasthoxhaist> the Virgin Chris vs the Chad Carlos
[4:37:36] <%optimasmaximas> LUL
[4:37:36] <%tusk102> STEAL

[4:37:42] <%Taisuru> Wow pat
[4:37:42] <%FoogUwU> ..........
[4:37:42] <NiktenKing> Uhhhh
[4:37:42] <plankk56> give her some herb
[4:37:42] <%MalekDracarus> SHES A BOX
[4:37:44] <%storkeylope> Doesn’t a vaccine prevent disease, and explicitly not cure it??
[4:37:44] <%IKilledADeadGuy> heuhueheuhue
[4:37:45] <%TheSphereHunter> poor Jill tired
[4:37:45] <%Shadicara> Kreygasm Kreygasm Kreygasm
[4:37:46] <%hahaha1171> use jill
[4:37:48] <+SargentToughie> Jill is an intractable environment
[4:37:49] <%bluefooddye1> Carlos the big action hero man, shooting the zambos with his AR
[4:37:49] <BritishTyrannosaur> i like this sorta inverse of Leon saving ada/getting the sample
[4:37:50] <reinbachthe3rd> Vaccine doesn't really make sense if she's already infected...
[4:37:50] <reonome> stuff an herb in her mouth
[4:37:52] <%tusk102> can you steal her items? @PatStaresAt
[4:37:52] <circular7> shoot her KappaClaus
[4:37:52] <dukenux> pls dont
[4:37:52] <Birdigalore> Combine Jill with high grade gunpowder
[4:37:52] <Domonomin> oh no
[4:37:55] <%ShichiNoBushi> For relaxing times, make it Carlos time.
[4:37:55] <%DesuDesuDokiDoki> use the item box
[4:37:58] <deviljhojho_> the times you fight him are damn cool
[4:37:58] <%Aracon_> yeah nemesis has been very, situational
[4:37:59] <%Fien111> VVymyn are REUSABLE items, thank you!
[4:38:02] <myriad_truth> You fight him enough for me!
[4:38:02] <SivSarcast> That last fight wasn't Nemesis at all.
[4:38:06] <+MeatBomb> MY BRAIN IS FULL GORGED
[4:38:08] <mortificent> the fights that are here are SO COOL THO
[4:38:08] <%TheSphereHunter> that's the problem.....
[4:38:08] <%Ganerumo> Better than making him MR X 2
[4:38:09] <%spiritofmojave> Let Jill rest the rest of the game, just wow.
[4:38:09] <%kid_flashionable> I honestly don't mind, I'm terrified of him
[4:38:09] <UvBenServed> Just wait until Arch Tempered Nemesis
[4:38:09] <%Hellarussian> less is more i guess
[4:38:09] <lionandfox21> super scary lobby
[4:38:10] <%stemlo_> @TheSphereHunter Have Leon and Jill ever hung out anywhere in the timeline?
[4:38:12] <Dr_Mooose> quality over quantity
[4:38:13] <thelasthoxhaist> hope there more nemesis
[4:38:16] <%valriot> It would be kind of annoying if he was around that much
[4:38:18] <clintonificent> well it was the same in the original, the Nemesis chases ended at the cable car
[4:38:19] <Dio_TR> HUR HUR NEW GAME
[4:38:23] <%D3rrtyD4n> he doesn't stalk like mr x
[4:38:26] <Lt_Campbell> LUL
[4:38:28] <clintonificent> Well nvm except for one section
[4:38:29] <%Nobody404> FINGER FAMILY
[4:38:30] <Birdigalore> Frost that hair you gorgeous man
[4:38:30] <dukenux> is that BETER?
[4:38:31] <star_feline> Embrace the thumb family
[4:38:31] <Darren716> Oh fuck its finger family, kill it
[4:38:34] <takokasa> Was the thumb Dwight Fairfield?
[4:38:34] <+GenesisKnight> Good ol' Tyrell
[4:38:34] <%spiritofmojave> Daddy finger oh god
[4:38:34] <Ragnaroked_> ITS THAT STUPID FINGER SONG THING
[4:38:35] <+MeatBomb> WASH YOUR HANDS
[4:38:36] <%DesuDesuDokiDoki> its better then over doing it
[4:38:36] <%Aracon_> not really gettin the vibe that he's chasing you around the city, he just appears when he's supposed to
[4:38:37] <%trekkie11041> FINGER FAMILY
[4:38:37] <thelasthoxhaist> yum baby
[4:38:37] <Cleric4gg> By that, you mean he doesn't chase you enough like X did in remake?
[4:38:38] <%Hellarussian> MAKING LIFE BETTER
[4:38:39] <%Dragon_Batman> Hand family just doing the best they can
[4:38:39] <Birdigalore> Vore me, mommy!
[4:38:40] <abuse_of_juice> fingah pappet
[4:38:40] <%tusk102> @PatStaresAt do you think they'd even dare touch re4?
[4:38:40] <%dekkitout> DIOOO!
[4:38:42] <clintonificent> he did stalk you in clock tower but 6 of the 7 item drops are in the city
[4:38:43] <Monkeyweed21> YOU WILL BE TREATED
[4:38:44] <Dio_TR> UNBIRTH
[4:38:44] <dukenux> """"Making Life Better""""
[4:38:47] <%Shacklebox> DIO!
[4:38:48] <%valriot> LUL LUL
[4:38:49] <FrontLineFluffyBunny> blind
[4:38:51] <+necrocannibal2> @PatStaresAt people are more disappointed that he doesn't stalk like Mr X, I think
[4:38:52] <mr_slaide> WE LOVE YOU, ELMO!!!
[4:38:54] <myriad_truth> It is a hospital...
[4:38:55] <%tiaramaki> Zombos are prolly gonna pop in from those
[4:38:55] <FaytLeingodz> LUL
[4:38:56] <star_feline> The zombie dog doors
[4:38:56] <clintonificent> SPOOKY HOSPITAL
[4:38:56] <Zebroneath> I kinda hoped he'd be a more constant threat during exploration like Mr. X.
[4:38:57] <+Trabnaxes> What if Nemesis and Mr. X teamed up and chased you at the same time in online? wouldn't that be crazy?
[4:38:57] <%TheSphereHunter> I wonder what might happen in here...
[4:38:57] <megakruemel> ah yes. assault rifle ammo on the hospital receptionist counter.
[4:38:58] <deviljhojho_> HMMMMM
[4:38:58] <%Hellarussian> windowphobe
[4:38:58] <UvBenServed> It's fine
[4:38:58] <Birdigalore> RE4 cabin?
[4:38:59] <%spiritofmojave> OR THE MAIN ENTRANCE
[4:39:00] <%SilvaChariot0133> Just big enough for something to bust through Kappa
[4:39:03] <%spiritofmojave> So many weakpoints
[4:39:04] <lionandfox21> There's like a bunch dude
[4:39:04] <%valriot> You like Cabins, Pat?
[4:39:04] <worldbrand> big fat evil
[4:39:04] <$bootysteve> I don't know that there's a worse name for a hospital than Spencer Memorial
[4:39:07] <$lotharrio> It's like he's praying for zombie dogs.
[4:39:09] <%tusk102> @PatStaresAt think they're even gonna touch re4
[4:39:09] <Emperor_Mittens> The windows don't like you either.
[4:39:10] <%Dragon_Batman> Me thinks a trailer gives something away
[4:39:10] <%Fien111> Time for dumb hunchback geckos!
[4:39:12] <%professormorrigan> hunter x carlos
[4:39:14] <Dio_TR> THERE IS GOING TO BE A CABIN MOMENT
[4:39:15] <%Hellarussian> its 2020 all windows are beautiful
[4:39:21] <%Aracon_> yes
[4:39:22] <star_feline> nope
[4:39:24] <%tusk102> think they got the balls?
[4:39:25] <lionandfox21> maybe a remaster
[4:39:25] <%PanicSwytch> I like his save room music
[4:39:25] <Valentinius_Anodyne> Maybe
[4:39:27] <thelasthoxhaist> it should have more ventilation if its a hospital
[4:39:28] <xxshadowxx416> no
[4:39:28] <%spiritofmojave> They shouldn't
[4:39:28] <%tiaramaki> They better not
[4:39:30] <%DesuDesuDokiDoki> maybe
[4:39:31] <clintonificent> Oh they're about to touch RE4 in like 1 hour
[4:39:32] <Crimpson> RE4 Remake would be pretty damn long
[4:39:32] <reonome> its literally a plagas
[4:39:32] <%stemlo_> @valriot I know exactly what you mean
[4:39:34] <$bootysteve> that's like Harvey Weinstein Memorial Women's Shelter
[4:39:34] <%Hellarussian> they gonna touch RE4
[4:39:35] <%conflict1914> Windows? More like NEMESIS HOLES
[4:39:35] <%Aracon_> I think it's entirely probably
[4:39:35] <majindusto> BUT ITS NOT
[4:39:35] <Deadbulky> Think they will remake CVX?
[4:39:36] <%SoFarFetched> They probably will
[4:39:36] <+Artumoc> more RE4 re releases
[4:39:36] <%Fien111> CVX needs it so much more, come on
[4:39:36] <BritishTyrannosaur> I'd rather tey touch dead aim
[4:39:37] <Kalinflip> They could but it would be hard to make it better
[4:39:37] <%ShichiNoBushi> An HD update to RE4 would be fine.
[4:39:38] <%TheSphereHunter> It's the N E Alpha parasite!
[4:39:38] <%LaughingCatt> Could be a cool lead in
[4:39:38] <bleugh> they're going to just rerelease it again Kappa
[4:39:39] <xxshadowxx416> they have to
[4:39:41] <megakruemel> but super HD cool Leon?!
[4:39:41] <rufus2k2> just make code veronica good goddammit
[4:39:42] <%spiritofmojave> Just touch up 5
[4:39:42] <%InugamiTheHound> re4 has been ported more than skyrim
[4:39:45] <+Jsaru> RE4 remake would be weird
[4:39:45] <Lib3rator> RE6 remake hype
[4:39:46] <clintonificent> remake dead aim and gun survivor yes
[4:39:46] <Kalinflip> if anything I would like updated graphics
[4:39:47] <%tusk102> @PatStaresAt i'd be up for it if they just redid the graphics but left the core gameplay mechanics identical
[4:39:47] <%Ganerumo> remake code veronica to not be trash instead

[4:40:03] <thelasthoxhaist> will plagas be the parasite that controls nemesis?

[4:54:44] <coreybom> @xerosigmaprime Honestly with the way the new stories of remake 2 and 3, it wouldn’t surprised me if they remade 4 with a darker tone instead of the goofy action horror one that it currently has. RE4 is amazing, but it was definitely a point where resident evil stop being as scary, or at focused on being scary. While this one has more action, it’s still based in horror. I won’t be surprised if they want RE4 to be more horror focused as well.

[5:38:52] <+BobBaudoin> So, is pat enjoying the game so farÉ

[5:39:04] <+Brickston> @T_Sasquatch Toilet paper is far too valuable to use as toilet paper these days
[5:39:06] <thisisacoolguy> What song is this? It's good as hell
[5:39:09] <+BobBaudoin> I wonder if he's gonna have the same experience sphere hunter had
[5:39:14] <%Dragon_Batman> He doesn't know where to even use the detonator, which I think is probably there for a specific moment
[5:39:23] <majindusto> 'This Hard mode Isn't Hard" says the Pat
[5:39:30] <Darkfire346> I kinda miss his shapeshifter brb song
[5:39:31] <clintonificent> Pat must be sent to ragequitter jail
[5:39:37] <%tusk102> @BobBaudoin he's liking it. he's also almost done
[5:39:41] <%XeroSigmaPrime> @tiaramaki Yea I guess so. Either that or they just didnt think/care about it. Its just a weird graphic thing that sorta takes you out of it
[5:39:44] <+BobBaudoin> Nice

[5:42:43] <%blasterprime> use the c4
[5:42:51] <%ricky12k> I be frank and say re 3 is pretty short.
[5:42:55] <+fashashbar> @huntercd some Duke died of that once, his bladder ruptured
[5:43:13] <+soullesskin> RE3 is super short
[5:43:24] <clintonificent> re3 original even is super short
[5:43:27] <$PadreHail> RE3 is about the same length as RE2 but it has less postgame content
[5:43:33] <+younger54> That was one of its main criticisms
[5:43:40] <%doc_ock_rokc> Getting very RE4 in here
[5:43:50] <clintonificent> cuz RE2 had the ! ZAPPING SYSTEM !
[5:43:52] <Wolfstriker121> all this is t's fault!
[5:43:53] <hcsarg1986> That exploding zombie sound effect is super goofy
[5:43:54] <%tusk102> yall remember the cabin?
[5:43:55] <%InugamiTheHound> this reminds me of zombie fight in the gun shop in leon's campaign in RE6

[5:58:03] <hcsarg1986> @Macguffn Yeah It's really depressing :(
[5:58:03] <clintonificent> dude the nuke/missile thing/whatever is so fuckin sad, it killed over 100K people according to the original game, and that could just be 100K uninfected hoomans

[5:58:55] <lordzaskez> no
[5:58:55] <dreu81> No waaay
[5:58:55] <Ultimatefool> Time to trash the knife
[5:58:55] <boomstickery> take the stuff off your other gun
[5:58:55] <FrontLineFluffyBunny> remove parts and put onto other?

[5:58:58] <JaerHQ> meechPog
[5:58:59] <%InugamiTheHound> shoots 3 rounds
[5:59:00] <clintonificent> hmmmmm DECISIONS
[5:59:03] <%Partialrecall2> stendo is always better
[5:59:03] <$Zalthia> Yeah it’s because I’m on mobile. That’s so freaking dumb.
[5:59:03] <MrDonTacos_> no way fam
[5:59:04] <%sniffy77> 100,000 deaths from the nuke? Isn't the number of US Corona deaths estimated to be 100,000? :l
[5:59:04] <%Dragon_Batman> It might be good in a way but who knows it
[5:59:06] <$Dakuu75> looks like it'll act like the Matilda from RE2
[5:59:08] <Zuzu_Pachulia> BIG NUMBER OR DO COMBO
[5:59:08] <%Dragon_Batman> is burst
[5:59:08] <reinbachthe3rd> Probably can stun-lock with that 3-round burst.
[5:59:08] <+Brickston> gee pat how come your mom lets you have two handguns
[5:59:10] <Wolfstriker121> choice time
[5:59:10] <Zebroneath> might as well rock it
[5:59:12] <TurtlesAndTentacles> probably
[5:59:13] <+HelloImTom08> I never liked burst
[5:59:13] <%Agami23> first they make her look like tomb raider now they give her two hand guns? whats next?!
[5:59:13] <%spiritofmojave> 3 rounds seems more innacurate tho
[5:59:14] <%doc_ock_rokc> Its Doo combo
[5:59:14] <Dio_TR> Yep RE 4 Remake is definitely being made
[5:59:14] <%trekkie11041> maybe try and put the attachments
[5:59:15] <%Nope80808> Burst pistols suck
[5:59:16] <%Maids4lyfe> it's burst fire
[5:59:17] <%theshillman> @ClericOfSparda damn pat and his corporate shill ways
[5:59:17] <+NitronStreams> dual wield them like Ebony and Ivory
[5:59:18] <Valentinius_Anodyne> No gods no masters, only GUN
[5:59:19] <$Dakuu75> save and test fire
[5:59:19] <%TheDullaMAN> It's High DPS vs. High Crit Rate
[5:59:20] <%tusk102> bursty
[5:59:21] <%WritebroAlpha> Swap the mods over if you can
[5:59:21] <SLVRBAKSLPZ> IRL same gun different trigger pack
[5:59:21] <maxamillion629> why are you asking chat about the game that just came out they dont know
[5:59:22] <%Taisuru> 3 shots vs 1 shot
[5:59:25] <FrontLineFluffyBunny> swap part!
[5:59:26] <RC_S3kshun8> @PatStaresAt Personally, I'd keep the Glock 19 - laser sight + suppressor.
[5:59:27] <%trekkie11041> SWAP MODS OVER
[5:59:29] <thelasthoxhaist> we gotta nuke NYC
[5:59:29] <+venom5547> Cant you take the parts off the other pistol like in RE2?
[5:59:30] <%strugglepunk2> can you swap the mods over?
[5:59:30] <Landedx> can u requip the attachments?
[5:59:32] <grimwire1> swap mods
[5:59:33] <%MonsieurHedge> can you take the upgrades off the OG and slap em on the burst version
[5:59:36] <%Dragon_Batman> Can you even swap mods?
[5:59:36] <boomstickery> what about teh supressor and sight cant they be transfered?
[5:59:38] <+Mugen4552> no silencer no sights. eats ammo faster but that should not be a problem.
[5:59:38] <Macguffn> 3 bullet vs 1 bullet, that's two more bullets per bullet
[5:59:39] <%shadylawyerman> Id think for body shots its better
[5:59:41] <Fujiwara_92> can you swap mods?
[5:59:42] <%WritebroAlpha> SWAP MODS

[5:59:52] <%tusk102> @PatStaresAt more damage+shooting versus higher crit rate
[5:59:52] <clintonificent> you can do that in re2r
[5:59:53] <%Taisuru> You should check
[5:59:55] <%WritebroAlpha> 1
[5:59:56] <solidmsocks> thatll be to op if so
[5:59:57] <$Dakuu75> does this mean you can save the mods for THIS gun?

[6:08:02] <%toolofparanoia> VALENTIME is the best
[6:08:04] <reinbachthe3rd> Boss fountain.
[6:08:04] <+DynDimAcsiwn> it's the most reliable tactic
[6:08:05] <RC_S3kshun8> ***
[6:08:05] <%ShichiNoBushi> Very powerful. Especially against living things.
[6:08:11] <Wolfstriker121> its gonna be crazy for no dmg runs i will tell you that lol
[6:08:13] <LevelClear> Yes Pat!!!!
[6:08:15] <chrishansen69_> clintonificent, his katas were impressive.. the invisible enmies were beaten, but it was beaten by the visible grenade launcher
[6:08:16] <Explodincatz> speedrunning is overrated
[6:08:18] <$Dakuu75> are blue herbs gone?
[6:08:23] <clintonificent> i can't wait for bawkbasoup and carcinogen to just stream the stupidest hardest runs
[6:08:30] <+MeatBomb> SAVE ROOM PEPE

[6:08:40] <TurtlesAndTentacles> @Explodincatz Ive never wanted to try it but it is impressive
[6:08:42] <todcomod> DOES PAT LIKE THE REMAKE?
[6:08:46] <dreu81> There is still a ton of ammo
[6:08:46] <%toolofparanoia> Pat good at bideo gaems
[6:08:48] <FrontLineFluffyBunny> crawl under the barrier
[6:08:49] <bendatron> Gun seems kinda bad just being a speed increase over accuracy essentially wasting ammo
[6:08:49] <clintonificent> you beat it on hardcore? did you even press start?
[6:08:50] <venomfury86> those speedrun videos are the good part of IGN
[6:08:50] <%InugamiTheHound> pat does it "hardcore" everytime
[6:08:52] <%barkon345> there are harder difficulties then this

[6:33:15] <%tusk102> @Paynexkiller 6 hours and 30 min in. but 30 was probs him talking
[6:33:16] <%Piemen99> Has T died on screen yet?
[6:33:20] <godzookylives> This is the best depiction of Jill by far
[6:33:21] <TurtlesAndTentacles> So the Remakes have given great horror and action. So....RE6 REMAKE WHEN!
[6:33:26] <%AncelDeLambert> jfc Pat, you've been going for seven hours
[6:33:27] <+Paynexkiller> I miss the music in these games.
[6:33:27] <%tusk102> @Piemen99 who?
[6:33:28] <%doc_ock_rokc> @Piemen99 not yet
[6:33:31] <Wolfstriker121> im assuming during this time..resident evil outbreak is happening atm?
[6:33:32] <chrishansen69_> This Jill is a subway sandwich, she packs it all
[6:33:33] <YaiGameworks> Pat will probably have a completion time of 7 & a half to 8 hours (subtracting his break time to eat and stuff.)
[6:33:35] <%Piemen99> ok good

[6:33:40] <%Dragon_Batman> Yea despite the not as much Nemesis and small sandbox to sandbox thing, which doesn't bother me personally, this game is great
[6:33:41] <lordzaskez> look at the map
[6:33:45] <%professormorrigan> Revelations is the best depiction of Jill's butt.
[6:33:51] <bxdragon> Can't really call her a officer of the law...Jill at this point might as well be a fucking commando

[6:35:18] <Wolfstriker121> the rules!!
[6:35:18] <knotsundownsyndrome> @Darren716 sometimes you don't actually do surgery with anesthetic with the brain
[6:35:20] <%ShichiNoBushi> Base! I call "base"!
[6:35:21] <%reonome> videogames
[6:35:22] <Crimpson> @hcsarg1986 That zombie in that room he was just in. Had no clothing, but in his undies
[6:35:28] <TurtlesAndTentacles> or would children be eaten quickly
[6:35:31] <stealthfart> I want there to be DLC for a rule breaker into the save room
[6:35:33] <knotsundownsyndrome> mostly due to the patient needing to sometimes being conscious to ensure someone isn't utterly fucked
[6:35:34] <thelasthoxhaist> the valanTime
[6:35:35] <Macguffn> They should put in a zombie that can only attack you in the save room and nowhere else
[6:35:36] <Dio_TR> NEMMY TIME
[6:35:41] <%dekkitout> So like- are there any other Nem time enemies who bust into safe rooms at this point, or...
[6:35:44] <Darren716> Nah but Umbrella did it specifically to produce some sort of fear gas or some shit
[6:35:47] <knotsundownsyndrome> it doesn't really hurt either since you actually lack any pain sensory in the brain
[6:35:47] <GetWicked> TRAP ROOM
[6:35:49] <Bigfattycat> are ya winning son?
[6:35:52] <%Partialrecall2> they dont actually experiment on kids those are just food for the hunters
[6:36:10] <%Taisuru> @Macguffn You've heard of Crimsonheads, now get ready for Dickheads

[6:36:18] <%Piemen99> ye that makes it SO much better
[6:36:22] <%doc_ock_rokc> @Partialrecall2 They experimented on orphins last remake
[6:36:24] <bxdragon> But they did experiment on kids.
[6:36:28] <%cylish> @Partialrecall2 Both most likely

[6:44:45] <%tusk102> @PadreHail cvx was retroactively made re-canon by re7 sadly
[6:44:45] <lionandfox21> Then that means the save room isn't gonna be safe
[6:44:45] <+ZedSlayer> and mr xs
[6:44:46] <RichochetForce> Seriously, if they skip over CVX and render it non-canon the series would be better for it.

[6:45:18] <%doc_ock_rokc> @Binary_Fireball are you saying tvirus is demonic corruption?
[6:45:21] <BurdRightsActivist> Question for chat: I loved RE2 Remake, is this just as good or is it as mixed as the reviews are saying?
[6:45:21] <%angel949> so no head?
[6:45:23] <stealthfart> I feel like this should be the one place where the infection didn’t actually spread and that it’s just Nikolai running through and taking everyone out
[6:45:24] <+ZedSlayer> she already said "ill give you STARS"
[6:45:25] <%Aleate> But you might need those shotgun rounds later psaGoblin
[6:45:26] <Alseid> @RC_S3kshun8 she said it already
[6:45:30] <Nupinoop296> and you were rewarded
[6:45:30] <MSN04_Sazabi> You could make RE 3.5 about actually taking down Umbrella instead of the stock market
[6:45:35] <oniwahoo> Isaac Graves huh
[6:45:37] <%tusk102> @PadreHail in re7 they mention the company that wesker worked for in CVX, thus making CVX canon again

[6:49:19] <%TheBitingIrish> @loukemia83 Would probably be worse then surviving Ebola
[6:49:19] <stealthfart> Areas got cut and some areas got expanded on. The worm probably would’ve been exactly like the alligator from two and I can see them actually using the worm in a code Veronica remake

[7:01:41] <Ianrazz> @BurdRightsActivist You just outed yourself as the one guy
[7:01:42] <+Paynexkiller> Don't shit on him, Re2make was a rushed mess.
[7:01:42] <knotsundownsyndrome> in response to her comments
[7:01:43] <%PrettyThickandStrongDyck> i dont understand
[7:01:43] <%doc_ock_rokc> Video game journjalists don't like it

[7:01:44] <%Diana869> FAST
[7:01:45] <%DesuDesuDokiDoki> he flopped in
[7:01:45] <stealthfart> Pat is playing on hard-core, so some sections do seem like they’re lasting longer and I can imagine reviewer’s and other people might be playing on easier difficulties
[7:01:46] <%jinking79> ppl tryin to start some shit
[7:01:46] <deviljhojho_> spooky

[7:02:08] <JunkyardCrow> stupid sexy zombie
[7:02:09] <+Delenay> commence the wiggling
[7:02:10] <venomfury86> they played it on a lower difficulty, that's why it felt short
[7:02:11] <deviljhojho_> TRICKSTER
[7:02:11] <Alseid> Stop being a Marilyn Manson music video character
[7:02:13] <+hunterm93> How's the game so far, Pat?
[7:02:14] <reinbachthe3rd> @nofestu2 Straight up. lol
[7:02:14] <RichochetForce> Zombie with the CSGO skills
[7:02:14] <+ZedSlayer> shes been infected already
[7:02:16] <Dao_Puppy> Does it snap to the head automatically aftera roll?
[7:02:18] <megaminimechamocha> So this is like... the end of the game, right?
[7:02:19] <%doc_ock_rokc> Okay pats a badass stop making him prove it
[7:02:20] <clintonificent> guys its simple, that game has a high execution ceiling with dodging/countering, and has way more enemies to hurt the player, so game designers, similar to their opinion towards character action, are like I DONT LIKE IT
[7:02:21] <mastermidget23> @thespherehunter Do you think you'll find yourself replaying it as much as 2make? I'm excited to play it tonight but a little worried about replay value.
[7:02:21] <%ha2ken> Is 5this a bit?
[7:02:25] <+ZedSlayer> carlos had to do a whole ass "hold the line" bit
[7:02:27] <chrishansen69_> Never be a Jill Turkish pizza
[7:02:28] <%ClericOfSparda> Funny, I thought Suzy didn't like it. SphereHunter's spoiler-free review made me second guess buying it right away.
[7:02:29] <fragdar> people complaining that nemesis dont follow you as hard as mr X, but in the end, mr X was so prevesible and boring to fight that i dont mind more scripted encounters
[7:02:30] <%toolofparanoia> Why do you even try not using slowmo?
[7:02:32] <%Alig200> @Dao_Puppy only if you manually aim after dodging perfectly
[7:02:34] <%barrakuta371> He fall out of the vent, you just didn't see him while he was onscreen
[7:02:40] <%toolofparanoia> I would abuse the hell out of it
[7:02:49] <clintonificent> not saying this game is perfect, it has some flaws but like its an awesome video game
[7:02:50] <fenrirmitsuki> Greetings to all from Kansas. How’s everyone holding up?
[7:02:51] <%WritebroAlpha> WE DO IT
[7:02:51] <Guardiansaiyan> @toolofparanoia to look professional
[7:02:56] <Monkeyweed21> are you?
[7:02:58] <knotsundownsyndrome> game's not assblastingly amazing but it still seems good
[7:03:02] <%TheSphereHunter> @mastermidget23 You can still do a bunch of different challenge runs and unlock a buncha stuff. The difficulties remix enemies and item placement
[7:03:02] <megaminimechamocha> @ClericOfSparda She calls it her second favourite game of all time
[7:03:03] <+MeatBomb> Do you think Reese's Pieces and Banana Runts = PB and Banana Sammich?>
[7:03:04] <knotsundownsyndrome> and that's what i can ask for out of a game

[7:03:11] <%Wolfstriker121> The no dmg runs are gonna be crazy
[7:03:12] <chrishansen69_> I missed most of the game, how do we rate it so far?
[7:03:13] <TedLives> its almost like reviewer rushed through the game? hmmmmm? i wonder..
[7:03:14] <boomstickery> im not buying it unless you get to kill him
[7:03:16] <Guardiansaiyan> @hcsarg1986 I didn't! Sorry!

[7:11:09] <stealthfart> We need like three heals in there

[7:11:43] <hcsarg1986> @Guardiansaiyan I heard recently his last name being Spencer was a reference to the Spencer family of which Winston Churchill and Princess Diana were memebers. Which is ironic if because he represents the exact opposite of their ideals.

[7:15:43] <+EkinRaider> @RC_S3kshun8 LUL
[7:15:45] <%TheBenson8r> And now, for something completely different
[7:15:46] <Birdigalore> Was that supposed to be the replacement for the fight where you melt Nemesis? Lame
[7:15:46] <clintonificent> it doesn't feel bad it just feels weird
[7:15:46] <%Piemen99> ITS ALMOST AS FIF WE ARE GOING INTO A BOSS FIGHT
[7:15:46] <JunkyardCrow> Ok I'm fine now :)
[7:15:46] <The_Maddness> Im sure theres no reason its loading you up on grenade rounds
[7:15:49] <%professormorrigan> things are getting a bit odd
[7:15:50] <Valentinius_Anodyne> Don't worry I'm sure he's dead now :)
[7:15:51] <stealthfart> If his tongue had burst through the floor in here, that would’ve been amazing.
[7:15:51] <xeros720> oh, that's a lot
[7:15:51] <+Paynexkiller> I know a couple girls who dream of wet tentacles if y'know what I'm saying

[7:15:52] <%aishman> BOSS TIME
[7:15:54] <Tagwaggin> why did that whole sequence feel rushed
[7:15:54] <Guardiansaiyan> @RichochetForce cause Chris isn't doing anything
[7:15:54] <CrazyMedicine> We did it chat, nemesis is no more
[7:15:56] <+PR0swagonist> wow its like a boss fountain or something

[7:15:59] <They_Call_Me_The_Fizz> NOW it's the final boss save room
[7:16:01] <%ClericOfSparda> It's a setup for a final nemesis transformation, I bet
[7:16:02] <Nelsukako> how many times nemmy got himself in a explosion ?
[7:16:03] <myriad_truth> GETTING READY FOR WAR!!!!
[7:16:04] <%TomDanksEGOT> its almost like an enemy that is completely neutralized by those will be in the next room
[7:16:05] <%spiritofmojave> that pacing is a little strange but still excite
[7:16:05] <Guardiansaiyan> @Ocaz STAY
[7:16:06] <%Tersalus> loudly declaring "well I'm glad THAT's over" after every single nemesis encounter
[7:16:08] <$PadreHail> Might as well end the stream here since we've reached the last cutscene
[7:16:09] <+soullesskin> I had to look over cuz it got calm all of a sudden
[7:16:10] <Guardiansaiyan> @Ocaz its almost over!

[7:22:26] <Tagwaggin> cool that umbrella just has a fucking gladiator arena under their labs

[7:22:28] <clintonificent> i wish this boss was a separate mutation, like the arena is cool but idk
[7:22:30] <$Dakuu75> are you suppose to shoo the red-button-looking thing? or the motor part?

[7:23:55] <%SparkAfterDark> Fucking longsword users
[7:23:55] <%professormorrigan> Capcom assets. Free real estate.
[7:23:55] <+venom5547> Pat hates the mine thrower so much he refuses to use its superior replacement
[7:23:56] <%TomDanksEGOT> That is a Texas Chili Bowl if Ive ever seen on
[7:23:57] <+Pendragwn> @PatStaresAt use your bone sword you fucking idiots
[7:23:57] <xxshadowxx416> use pistol for long shoots
[7:23:58] <Aji__> Nemesis... Neme... Nem.. M...Manus\
[7:24:00] <RichochetForce> Yeah, that is 100% Monster Hunter. It's basically Zinogre + Nerg
[7:24:00] <deviljhojho_> gotta get me some crooks
[7:24:01] <+ZedSlayer> what kinda mats you think nemmy gives
[7:24:02] <%dekkitout> Anyone got a Glutton 3 build monkaS cvHazmat ?
[7:24:03] <+vampireinarm> its monster hunter get your dark souls shit outta here
[7:24:03] <YakumoYomi> Did you get a Nemesis Mantle?!
[7:24:03] <%spiritofmojave> Jill should've gone to the canteen before smh
[7:24:05] <stealthfart> Should you be putting acid rounds on? I feel like for the second phase those would really help
[7:24:05] <auraofdawn> Man Capcom sure loves its monsters
[7:24:06] <+soullesskin> That seems cheap
[7:24:07] <fetrigon> They could honestly put this fight in MHWorld
[7:24:08] <%Dragon_Batman> ONe space
[7:24:10] <SleepyMaribo> get the extra 19 shotgun shells?
[7:24:11] <clintonificent> oh nemmy should just become El Gigante!
[7:24:17] <%valriot> Wait what happens if you don't bring the vaccine
[7:24:18] <+RedKazoo> Jill should really switch to Greatsword
[7:24:20] <chrishansen69_> Jill turd sandwich fight.
[7:24:21] <%ElkRiverDog> Kinda reminds me of Paarl
[7:24:24] <%WritebroAlpha> MHW free update to fight this Nemesis WHEN!?
[7:24:27] <%storkeylope> What if you put the vaccine in the box?.
[7:24:28] <%mankeyfigh> Is the vaccine stuck in your inventory?
[7:24:29] <%Dragon_Batman> That's goood
[7:24:29] <RichochetForce> @clintonificent Don't give them ideas.
[7:24:36] <%toolofparanoia> make Zinogre Type-N
[7:24:39] <clintonificent> i want human Nemmy but just BIG and HUGE
[7:24:39] <%Diana869> hammer is better for this fight
[7:24:53] <Duskendawn> Honestly when I did this, I magnumed the zomboes to save time
[7:24:54] <clintonificent> "Human Nemmy" is a phrase i actually just used holy shit i mean HUMANOID
[7:24:55] <+darudeampersandstorm> Nemesis is a beautiful boy
[7:24:57] <%Dragon_Batman> Well until the fight begins
[7:25:02] <RichochetForce> @Diana869 Nah, HBG spread is clearly better
[7:25:05] <waifoong98> Not using Aquashot Kappa
[7:25:06] <%doc_ock_rokc> HUNTING HORN OR BUST
[7:25:06] <%trekkie11041> HUNTING HORN YOU COWARD
[7:25:08] <Alseid> Hammer is better for EVERY fight
[7:25:09] <+Pendragwn> you really need to put some work into this lancegun build pat
[7:25:10] <kofumugi> Jill need to pop that signal flare for some Co-op action
[7:25:13] <+ZedSlayer> nah man use the GS
[7:25:13] <%Tucker0603> I prefer charge blade for the guard points
[7:25:15] <+soullesskin> Hammer? Nah hunting horn
[7:25:15] <%WritebroAlpha> Hunting Horns REPRESENT! Where my fellow Dooters at?
[7:25:15] <$PadreHail> I'll spread Jill's HBG
[7:25:16] <fetrigon> Zinogre Type-N! I like it!
[7:25:16] <clintonificent> Nemesis: Become Human
[7:25:17] <RichochetForce> 3 Shield mods and 2 close range mods and you're good.
[7:25:18] <%doc_ock_rokc> @trekkie11041 DOOTER BROTHER!
[7:25:19] <DetroitSentai> long sword best sword

[7:48:23] <ScreamLord> @PatStaresAt This looks like is the Xenomorph Queen got infected with the G-Virus
[7:48:25] <%tusk102> @Partialrecall2 that was like 8 shots compared to 2-3 grenade rounds lol
[7:48:28] <%Dragon_Batman> I imagine that is why there is like 60 rounds to your left
[7:48:33] <%Tersalus> look out, he's got a wrench!!
[7:48:43] <%Bluwizard21> @PatStaresAt is jill british? cause her "how bout some moar?" line is british sounding

[7:48:56] <clintonificent> this is like RE2R where the boss arenas have tons of pistol ammo and youre like "what why would i ever use a pistol here"
[7:48:56] <%toolofparanoia> grab the ammo in the back
[7:48:57] <%MonsieurHedge> if you cant knife only a boss its poorly designed

[7:57:48] <Grandma_Amari> JILL WHAT ARE YOU TALKING ABOUT
[7:57:48] <+superkeaton> Actually it literally was the virus, cause Wesker
[7:57:48] <reinbachthe3rd> "So long, RC" Yeah, appropriate response to nuclear armageddon.
[7:57:48] <clintonificent> Solidus plans to detonate a nuke high in the atompshere, pull Manhattan OFFLINE turn it into some sort of REPUBLIC
[7:57:48] <GandhiTheTerrible> So long, RC BibleThump
[7:57:49] <gekizenbu> it can be both

[7:57:53] <Grennold> Humans are the real virus! 4Head
[7:57:53] <redlanternreviews> The greed created the monster virus
[7:57:54] <%Dragon_Batman> It's more the ppl who did it
[7:57:54] <%tusk102> but wheres barry tho
[7:57:55] <ThespianBarrage> Greed is a virus!
[7:57:55] <%Partialrecall2> They do make helicopters that can survive EMPs now, but definitely not this helicopter... plus the concussion wave, plus the gamma rays
[7:57:55] <%SGrim> @PatStaresAt also the concussion wave from a nuke that close would have liquidized their bones.
[7:57:55] <+dezimaly> then the stock market got them

[7:59:06] <%majindusto> NO GRAVE DIGGER...NO BARRY BibleThump
[7:59:06] <%Bluwizard21> @PatStaresAt Just one time, I want one of the RE protags to Just scream "It's Wesker! It's always Wesker!. Fuck off, It is Wesker!"
[7:59:06] <+zcairstrike> It could have been a DLC to RE2, to be honest.
[7:59:07] <kofumugi> AGREED
[7:59:08] <myriad_truth> Its over 7 hours
[7:59:08] <GrandOnionKnight> barry dlc?
[7:59:09] <oniwahoo> Pat prefers RE2 over another Resident Evil game? Shocking
[7:59:09] <%shadowace2400> wow, it's already done in a single day?
[7:59:09] <sexy_tora> cut some things from og tho
[7:59:10] <+Tarage> @PatStaresAt is it better than RE6?
[7:59:10] <Deadbulky> Nah no way a 9
[7:59:10] <%Joestar1890> 7/10?
[7:59:11] <clonexsniperx> brad did say they were the only 2 stars in the city
[7:59:11] <+michingmallecho> BibleThump
[7:59:12] <%VritraReiRei> FAIR
[7:59:12] <Heyestus> just like OG RE3 then, huh?
[7:59:13] <Flame_Hyenard> So who's ready to get misty eye in a sec?
[7:59:15] <+younger54> Seems like a lot less content than RE2
[7:59:15] <%valriot> It never was gonna be better than RE2 LUL LUL
[7:59:15] <amask777> wasn't there two endings one with and without Barry in the classic version?
[7:59:15] <Deadbulky> 7/10
[7:59:16] <%RetroCop87> RE2 > RE3 > RE4 > RE7
[7:59:16] <eco419> 7/10
[7:59:16] <%SGrim> Well the original RE 3 was better than the original RE 2, so I guess turn about is fair.
[7:59:17] <Fro5tburn> 8cetera
[7:59:17] <fenrirmitsuki> Maybe Barry was the friends we made along the way?
[7:59:18] <%tusk102> @PatStaresAt nah take an extra point off bc no barry
[7:59:18] <Grandma_Amari> It feels like it was a bit short honestly? Maybe that's not fair though.
[7:59:18] <+BigBrainCostanza> 7
[7:59:18] <+gibbetterinternet> just like the original LUL
[7:59:18] <Grennold> The original got gutted but it's OK I guess
[7:59:19] <+king_of_beggars> I got here late. Was there any Jill sandwiches?
[7:59:19] <ThespianBarrage> what if 1?
[7:59:20] <YakumoYomi> Fair.
[7:59:20] <%the_vedo_show> this an 8/10
[7:59:21] <Darren716> I really dont like the nemesis changes
[7:59:22] <+Mitchellsocks> RE2 was a 1 out of 1, can't believe you're calling this a 0
[7:59:23] <thisisacoolguy> what if I thought RE2 was a 0?
[7:59:24] <Mister_McDerp> every game is 7/10
[7:59:25] <%Nope80808> Re2 0/10 Re3 -1/10
[7:59:25] <%professormorrigan> 7 or 8 seems fair
[7:59:26] <%hntronium> That's fair
[7:59:27] <+nirvana227> 8 out of 10
[7:59:29] <%Aracon_> I don't like how the game funnels you through the story
[7:59:29] <Run44forrest> RE4 THO PogChamp
[7:59:30] <trfurkanrey18> why did they make nemesis only scripted ? that sucks man
[7:59:30] <Guardiansaiyan> its too SHORT
[7:59:31] <+darudeampersandstorm> hard 7, light 8
[7:59:31] <MadDesperado13> I was hoping to explore the city
[7:59:32] <%Wolfstriker121> 8/10
[7:59:35] <+Tarage> @PatStaresAt but is it better than RE 6?
[7:59:38] <sappinmahbinyot> It's RE3
[7:59:39] <They_Call_Me_The_Fizz> I'm more than okay with an above-average RE
[7:59:40] <%DesuDesuDokiDoki> that is many games
[7:59:40] <Monkeyweed21> RE3 inherently didn't age as well
[7:59:41] <xxshadowxx416> are they make new canon
[7:59:41] <CrazyMedicine> No enough Nemesis 0/10
[7:59:44] <%MonsieurHedge> i mean, RE4's castle is the best part
[7:59:44] <Run44forrest> Re3 is the jobber of resident evil though
[7:59:45] <%valriot> Yeah, RE has always had that issue
[7:59:45] <clintonificent> first half is stellar, then it fizzles out in later half
[7:59:47] <%Aracon_> RE4 the castle is the best tho
[7:59:48] <mesamus> now max is starting HIS RE3 stream
[7:59:48] <%tiaramaki> The final form of Nemmy felt like a repeat of G form 5 instead of the other raw final Nemmy form
[7:59:48] <Grandma_Amari> Agreed, the first bits of RE3 remake looked to be the best
[7:59:50] <Grennold> They fucked the flow and pacing too much
[7:59:53] <Meekest> RE4 its the village
[7:59:56] <%Dragon_Batman> RE4 Village
[7:59:57] <%Archphronimos> Archphronimos subscribed with Twitch Prime. They've subscribed for 15 months! Hello ginger nerd. Thank you for the comedy, as usual. Please pet the baby, as is tradition. Hope you guys are well.
[8:00:00] <Guardiansaiyan> wants to know..WHERE WAS MARVIN?!
[8:00:01] <Darren716> Nah Castle is better
[8:00:01] <%whiskey_wolfe_> That's not a RE problem, that's a zombie setting problem.
[8:00:04] <luiscortezgaming2002> Is there a second run?
[8:00:05] <%MelBrooksKA> Ending of this one feels pretty strong compared to other RE's
[8:00:07] <%TheSphereHunter> but the song tho
[8:00:09] <megaman_sentinel> the dodge brakes the game
[8:00:09] <%코코꾸라> What about 6
[8:00:10] <%Divantae> the first levels always look great whereas the others look bland
[8:00:10] <Grennold> MUSIC Kreygasm
[8:00:11] <Mexrage> Carlos actually have the most hub like areas, while Jill are more set pieces @PatStaresAt
[8:00:13] <%rumtumtugnutz> @Tarage getting an infection from stepping on a nail in a gas station bathroom is better than RE6.
[8:00:13] <+RedKazoo> the huts LUL
[8:00:13] <%dekkitout> @Guardiansaiyan A shambling corpse
[8:00:13] <%DesuDesuDokiDoki> RE3make
[8:00:14] <%nofestu2> even re 6
[8:00:17] <kofumugi> RE6 THO
[8:00:17] <ajgilmore1> RE6 is the snow mission Kappa
[8:00:18] <+darudeampersandstorm> SourPls
[8:00:19] <Fujiwara_92> song good
[8:00:23] <%s1rcuit> @PatStaresAt Basically until you reach the hi-tech lab
[8:00:23] <%Jack_of_No_Trades> good music
[8:00:23] <Mrbaconator> RE6 Kappa
[8:00:24] <Guardiansaiyan> @dekkitout I meant did they even talk to him?
[8:00:25] <%spiritofmojave> BUT RE6 AND USTUBIAZ
[8:00:26] <%TheSphereHunter> I love this song so much...
[8:00:26] <amask777> we don't talk about 6, 6 never happened
[8:00:26] <MrDonTacos_> LUL
[8:00:26] <%tusk102> @PatStaresAt not as good as re6
[8:00:26] <heartlesshealer> =)
[8:00:27] <waifoong98> LUL
[8:00:28] <%InugamiTheHound> what about RE6? Does that have any good sections?
[8:00:28] <+MisterCrimson> @PatStaresAt what was the best part of RE6 tho?
[8:00:28] <%Divantae> RE6 is RE6
[8:00:30] <Duskendawn> Best track in the game
[8:00:30] <Nupinoop296> RE6 is all bad
[8:00:30] <%Lost_Zombie> Jill/10
[8:00:31] <heartlesshealer> 👏👏
[8:00:31] <%tusk102> ke
[8:00:32] <+RAAAAAINMAKER> Fuckin' Brad
[8:00:33] <Guardiansaiyan> @dekkitout and Marvin sad
[8:00:33] <%tusk102> kek
[8:00:33] <dead_harmony13> when's the remake remake?
[8:00:35] <venomfury86> RE6 LUL
[8:00:35] <+jjjdanny> ehhh
[8:00:36] <SubjectTea> RE 7 was the house as the best bit
[8:00:37] <%Joestar1890> Hey it's the OG credits theme
[8:00:38] <p_squid> !uptime
[8:00:38] <@Moobot> I've been playing this game for how long? Oh only 8h 40s.
[8:00:39] <xxshadowxx416> is this new canon
[8:00:41] <+TheEpicManWorld> What a short game
[8:00:41] <%ha2ken> This song is so good
[8:00:41] <%Partialrecall2> Good Job to your God Job at doing a Good Job
[8:00:42] <God_King_Chat_Dad_dom> what about 7
[8:00:42] <%SoFarFetched> TODD HABERKORN
[8:00:42] <%valriot> It's actually accurate to how RE3 actual was LUL
[8:00:42] <%spiritofmojave> I still can't believe Brad killed Marv
[8:00:43] <SomeAsianDood> NOW HE NOTICES
[8:00:43] <Run44forrest> I MISS RE6 FeelsBadMan
[8:00:43] <+SargentToughie> Oh, so Carlos survived huh?
[8:00:44] <Deadbulky> I cant give this higher than a 7 with the amount of content cut from the orginal
[8:00:44] <%Wolfstriker121> And re 6 is shit
[8:00:45] <+MeatBomb> FEELS BRAD MAN
[8:00:48] <FrontLineFluffyBunny> nemesis VO is named COCKMAN
[8:00:49] <Nupinoop296> he still killed Marvin
[8:00:50] <%tiaramaki> Zombie Brad being in the game was really cool at least
[8:00:50] <+ZedSlayer> Brad? or Bard?
[8:00:51] <%TheBitingIrish> @rumtumtugnutz I think I'd rather play RE6 then get tetanus
[8:00:52] <fetrigon> I think it's because the games new to you at the beginning.
[8:00:54] <herrcepo> Do you think they're going to make a replacement for CV? Not a remake, but like a complete replacement.
[8:00:55] <Grennold> Oh you noticed 4Head
[8:00:55] <Ran196> soft reboot
[8:00:59] <%ha2ken> The new RAIL canon
[8:01:00] <%maenos2> RE6...Ehhh LUL
[8:01:02] <%Joestar1890> But without Barry :(
[8:01:03] <Naho_Saenoki> Outbreak got better as it went along.
[8:01:05] <SchroedingersFerret> New Nemmy is way better
[8:01:07] <clintonificent> its a lot like RE7! Incredible game, but with some significant flaws that make it divisive
[8:01:08] <dreu81> Everybody likes Brad, he’s a good guy, even if he is a huge coward
[8:01:08] <Guardiansaiyan> @herrcepo why not?
[8:01:09] <amask777> shoulda gone back and killed Brad
[8:01:10] <%Ultimatefool> Why didn't Carlos say HEY JILL OVER HIERR!
[8:01:10] <Arrior_Septem> He finished it????
[8:01:12] <arkv01> this song is... chill AF
[8:01:12] <clintonificent> Dark Souls 2!
[8:01:14] <%dekkitout> That sweet sweet cannon better come to World PunOko
[8:01:15] <+blacksoap65> @PatStaresAt How does this compares to the original?
[8:01:15] <%kingbaconcrispy> Yeah but they look more accentuated
[8:01:15] <%Wolfstriker121> Brad became a mini boss
[8:01:15] <%Dragon_Batman> New Nemesis is pretty great tho
[8:01:15] <%valriot> It's a good remake for a not better than RE2 game
[8:01:15] <Monkeyweed21> NOW FOR CVX
[8:01:16] <hcsarg1986> But Brad saved everyone in the first game
[8:01:16] <fragdar> do you think they will remake other main line games?
[8:01:19] <YaiGameworks> Revelations 2 got better later in I gelt.
[8:01:19] <%Jack_of_No_Trades> i like plagas nemis
[8:01:20] <CrazyMedicine> RE4,5,6 Remake confirmed
[8:01:20] <Deadbulky> New nemmy is a weak beach tho
[8:01:21] <%Zabrewulf_X> Doing a double shift tomorrow! Have a good night, Pat!
[8:01:21] <Guardiansaiyan> @Ultimatefool showing off?
[8:01:22] <%Binary_Fireball> were there any real puzzles?
[8:01:23] <+RAAAAAINMAKER> Me... You... Same.... Fuck Brad
[8:01:24] <+NitronStreams> RE is nothing if not consistent LUL
[8:01:24] <+scorpiozilla> What type of problems will the CV Remake have?
[8:01:25] <+replicantj49gr> so RE4 Remake will be the best game ever?
[8:01:26] <%rumtumtugnutz> @TheBitingIrish It would be a tough, gun-to-my-head choice.
[8:01:26] <+michingmallecho> So it’s a good game then HahaBall
[8:01:26] <Mexrage> I feel we need a remake of Outbreak to fill some holes now, Pat
[8:01:27] <oniwahoo> and Pat has a boner for RE2
[8:01:29] <Helmed> i think original is better
[8:01:31] <%MonsieurHedge> so Nemesis' right hand comes off and his finalform is a big fuckoff flower like Salazar. RE4make confirmed?
[8:01:32] <%TheSphereHunter> Brad is in more of the RPD in Inferno mode
[8:01:32] <+darudeampersandstorm> @Zabrewulf_X have a good one, fam
[8:01:33] <Guardiansaiyan> @scorpiozilla Steve
[8:01:34] <Darren716> I like old nemmy more, you get to fight him more and get a shit ton of upgrades off him
[8:01:35] <%Partialrecall2> RE:3 1/2 Nemmy Goes to College
[8:01:36] <amask777> CV has to be next
[8:01:36] <%TheSphereHunter> he's a legit mini boss
[8:01:38] <sappinmahbinyot> RE5 Remake when?
[8:01:39] <%InugamiTheHound> @Naho_Saenoki I fucking love outbreak but man decisions decisions sucks ass along with hotel and subway
[8:01:42] <Run44forrest> THEY BETTER NOT FUCK UP RE4
[8:01:44] <Duskendawn> Brad not really a coward in this one. Retconned
[8:01:45] <clintonificent> yea
[8:01:45] <%Piemen99> BUT CARLOS
[8:01:47] <reinbachthe3rd> This is basically Stone Ocean JoJo for RE where we've delved in AU Resident Evil.
[8:01:48] <hhomura> time to rewatch the original re3 playthrough on yt
[8:01:48] <$TheEpicManWorld> SeemsGood100
[8:01:48] <MrDonTacos_> Railgun was fucking HYPE FeelsGoodMan
[8:01:51] <Deadbulky> 1 nade and he goes down
[8:01:52] <Tiewolf> How many Items did he dropp?
[8:01:52] <%TomDanksEGOT> Is there another route? or is it just a 6 hour campaign? atleast in 2 you have Claire and Leon which gives a little more value (especially if you're gonna pay full price)
[8:01:55] <luiscortezgaming2002> No Leon or claire
[8:01:56] <%doc_ock_rokc> 4-5
[8:01:56] <+Tarage> @PatStaresAt Is it better than the RE3 movie?
[8:01:56] <%Dragon_Batman> # main fights
[8:01:58] <Helmed> RE2R > RE2 RE3 > RE3R
[8:01:58] <%Zebroneath> Nemmy is overly present as he was in the original.
[8:01:58] <RC_S3kshun8> @PatStaresAt what did you get from Downing Nemmy? I saw he drops cases
[8:01:58] <+rytyoung> So RE CVX remake or RE 4 remake next @PatStaresAt ?
[8:02:01] <%Dragon_Batman> 3*
[8:02:01] <%tiaramaki> Original form I think was 4 times?
[8:02:01] <+aspirationdeath> original shits on this for breakfast
[8:02:02] <+NitronStreams> Nemesis was robbed
[8:02:02] <SaltyDongs> reboot canon
[8:02:03] <I_need_pants> RE4 Still GOAT
[8:02:03] <%coreyyotto> Yeah, the city section seemed way too short
[8:02:05] <lionandfox21> I'm off to see Max, bye Pat!
[8:02:07] <They_Call_Me_The_Fizz> You think Nicholai was working for "The Connections" or H.C.F.?
[8:02:07] <%Agami23> nemesis doesen't feel like he hunts you down as much as mr x in 2. and thats fucked up
[8:02:09] <%tusk102> @PatStaresAt yeah a major problem is nemesis. I like Nemesis' transformation a lot but i think you should have fought him more. Also them removing the entire clock tower kinda sucked
[8:02:10] <kofumugi> SourPls
[8:02:10] <%Xevtes> Do you think they are setting up a new canon and new story, moving away from 4,5,6?
[8:02:11] <Mexrage> @TheSphereHunter so he become Forest in One Dangerous Zombie
[8:02:12] <%ChaosAethr> This games Middle is Weak
[8:02:17] <+darudeampersandstorm> SourPls
[8:02:19] <bxdragon> Vote on Pat's score
[8:02:22] <%PrettyThickandStrongDyck> I personally thought the RE2R was fun but kinda boring with the later parts of the game
[8:02:23] <bxdragon> I say D
[8:02:28] <RC_S3kshun8> @PatStaresAt did you encounter Gravedigger?
[8:02:30] <sennoh> you only fight him directly once, when he has the flamethrower
[8:02:30] <%maenos2> This song is nice
[8:02:30] <+darudeampersandstorm> @bxdragon C
[8:02:30] <%Joestar1890> Bring back the Park!
[8:02:31] <Guardiansaiyan> @They_Call_Me_The_Fizz Probably the connections since HCF was Weskers thing
[8:02:33] <clintonificent> POWER PLANT BEST PART
[8:02:35] <%rumtumtugnutz> This game is for RE fans. It's not for new players.
[8:02:35] <clintonificent> DRAIN DEIMOS
[8:02:36] <+RAAAAAINMAKER> The City was so short
[8:02:39] <%TheSphereHunter> the park in og re3 is bad
[8:02:40] <%Joestar1890> Replace Jill hospital with the park!
[8:02:40] <Deadbulky> CLock tower cut
[8:02:41] <Naho_Saenoki> @RC_S3kshun8 Not in the game.
[8:02:41] <Grennold> PUT THE FUCKING CLOCK TOWER BACK
[8:02:42] <tri3dgE027> No Clock Tower rooREE
[8:02:42] <Aji__> what? the zoo isnt in?
[8:02:43] <Darren716> The whole Park got cut
[8:02:44] <+ZedSlayer> no brain suckers
[8:02:45] <%valriot> Gravedigger was shit LUL LUL
[8:02:45] <TDAWS_MP132> Drain Demons were oooooh
[8:02:46] <%StaceMcGate> @PatStaresAt we saying 7/10 or 8/10 then?
[8:02:48] <%tusk102> @PatStaresAt i miss the clocktower tbh
[8:02:51] <Aji__> That is fuckin dogshit
[8:02:53] <%TheBitingIrish> Yeah, the lab in RE2R feels kinda tacked on
[8:02:55] <Meekest> Yeah they were only in one section
[8:02:59] <%Mekhet09> I hate that there's no "I'll give you stars"
[8:02:59] <venomfury86> cut parts
[8:03:00] <+MeatBomb> Grave-Digger the Monster-Truck? Cool.
[8:03:01] <+ShadowRiida> New hospital and RPD are sick
[8:03:05] <YaiGameworks> Two types of Hunters even
[8:03:06] <%InugamiTheHound> worst enemy in the re3 remake?
[8:03:07] <+RAAAAAINMAKER> Those mouth rapist spiders can fucking go though
[8:03:08] <Guardiansaiyan> No park...or more RPD...or City...8/10
[8:03:15] <Tiewolf> The Hunters look amazing in this
[8:03:16] <%shyguysupreme> better than re2make?
[8:03:18] <bxdragon> I didn't think they would have put in the diverging path from the original
[8:03:18] <+budyd> this music is boom though
[8:03:19] <Tiewolf> Like holyshit
[8:03:19] <+ShadowRiida> Also, Nifghtmare and inferno mode change shit up, makes it really tough
[8:03:20] <$Literal___Nobody> Bring Back Crimson Heads
[8:03:20] <kofumugi> Hunter here was the best
[8:03:21] <Dao_Puppy> They move like weird matrix agents.....
[8:03:22] <%BalloniWright> Carlos Punch Kreygasm
[8:03:25] <%Archphronimos> Do you think it's even possible to remake CVX similarly to this and 2 but have it not be bad?
[8:03:26] <luiscortezgaming2002> Now back to pornhub
[8:03:28] <$milhousego> Is there no second scenario in this one like in RE 2?
[8:03:28] <+Trabnaxes> 5
[8:03:30] <Guardiansaiyan> @shyguysupreme he said RE2 Remake better than this remake
[8:03:30] <clintonificent> it shoulda been Flame-Acid-Freeze-Mine
[8:03:34] <%tusk102> @PatStaresAt wasn't the problem with the other games that hunters did random damage and sometimes insta killed you?
[8:03:34] <Fujiwara_92> CARLOS PUNCH PogChamp
[8:03:35] <%Dragon_Batman> Well 3 guaranteed in the lab
[8:03:39] <%valriot> Hunter were always annoying, and ammo dumps, but they feel way better with the dodge and counter system
[8:03:39] <heartlesshealer> <3
[8:03:41] <%dalishprince> 👀
[8:03:41] <+darudeampersandstorm> PogChamp

[8:03:46] <%Diana869> PogChamp
[8:03:49] <%SoFarFetched> When REv 2 though
[8:03:52] <%TheSphereHunter> Nightmare is a better experience in my opinion

[8:04:10] <RC_S3kshun8> @PatStaresAt I saw that Flame rounds were super good for one-shotting the sewer hunters. I forget if those are beta or gamma. Think it's gamma.

[8:04:49] <xxmagonx> GOOD
[8:04:49] <+corrosivePaladin> its ok just recon re6 completely
[8:04:50] <deviljhojho_> this makes this game better

[8:04:52] <Deadbulky> CV REMAKE
[8:04:52] <heartlesshealer> Ori's pretty damn good

[8:04:53] <God_King_Chat_Dad_dom> thanks missed it @SubjectTea
[8:04:53] <+NitronStreams> RE6 NEVER HAPPENS
[8:04:54] <MrDonTacos_> YEYEYE
[8:04:54] <eco419> Re6
[8:04:54] <%Aracon_> RE4make is definitely gonna happen
[8:04:55] <transporterthesequel> Wasn't the public, it was Local Public Access
[8:04:56] <%professormorrigan> yeah i think its in the works
[8:04:56] <RichochetForce> RE6 will be wiped from canon. RE4 canon is next.
[8:04:58] <%Dragon_Batman> There probably is
[8:04:58] <+Fonarios> can't wait for more animal crossing next friday because what else could it possibly be
[8:04:58] <thelasthoxhaist> good remake
[8:04:59] <+HelloImTom08> oh FOR SURE
[8:05:00] <%residentfunko> residentfunko is continuing the Gift Sub they got from mikyefreash! 
[8:05:00] <Monkeyweed21> cvx tho
[8:05:03] <%croxeye> they're making RE8 as well!!
[8:05:03] <Mister_McDerp> RE4MAKE FOR SURE
[8:05:04] <%indig0bird> I think it'll be a soft reboot
[8:05:04] <Guardiansaiyan> @NitronStreams peace
[8:05:05] <%TheBitingIrish> Please don't remake RE4 :(
[8:05:05] <Tiewolf> I just want Outbreak
[8:05:06] <%KingVantq> remaking everything to line up with RE7
[8:05:08] <foulfoamz> for sure for sure
[8:05:08] <Aji__> Vs Krauser!
[8:05:10] <jcflyguy> As long as they get Jarl Baalgruf to voice Saddler again.
[8:05:10] <+Kingjhon8> RE4REMAKE
[8:05:10] <Grennold> If NE-T parasite derives fro RE4 then RE1 got retconned out too
[8:05:11] <Cole_Mooneyes> What is the length of the game?
[8:05:11] <+PaniktheCat> How can you remake RE4 though
[8:05:11] <%cherrycottontail> Don't forget the monster hunter fights
[8:05:12] <+HelloImTom08> i mean plagus are in it
[8:05:13] <+michingmallecho> Let RE6 die.
[8:05:13] <%tusk102> @PatStaresAt the problem with OG hunters was their random damage right? they'd just randomly insta knock you to red or insta kill?
[8:05:13] <+RAAAAAINMAKER> Sick a knife on your boot
[8:05:14] <%ospreyworks> Felt like they were really building up the Aklay Incident
[8:05:14] <%Joestar1890> I'd kinda like RE8 now, RE4 later.
[8:05:14] <%StaceMcGate> @PatStaresAt what do you think of DLC for this?
[8:05:14] <NeetKiller> Pl s no RE4
[8:05:15] <Tiewolf> Or a different CVX
[8:05:16] <+michingmallecho> LET IT DIE
[8:05:17] <+ktothec99> Would be better to get Code Veronica imo
[8:05:17] <CrazyMedicine> Knife battle Vs Krauser
[8:05:19] <TheyCallMeVawn> The dodge mechanics and punch mechanic could super be in RE4 Remake
[8:05:21] <+darudeampersandstorm> count on RE4make for 2022
[8:05:22] <%toolofparanoia> Hey pat! CONGRATS ON BEATING RE3! I can't wait to play this game for myself. Ive never played the original but knew what always happened. Sucks that it seemed nemesis wasn't in more of the game plus some other RE3 monsters. I would agree that it doesn't seem as good as RE2 remake but this still was pretty cool. Also the Carlos missions... superb! Can't wait for more persona 5 royal! Cheer100
[8:05:23] <%storkeylope> REM4KE
[8:05:24] <%valriot> @patstaresat RE4 remake doesn't need to replace RE4, just reimagine it
[8:05:24] <heartlesshealer> they have tracking too
[8:05:26] <%ha2ken> Will we get the RE2R Leon model tho?
[8:05:26] <%Divantae> RE8 is def soon though
[8:05:27] <+Mercilesssn4> @PatStaresAt What about Code Veronica?
[8:05:30] <thelasthoxhaist> if they uncanon RE6 and RE5 i will be happy
[8:05:31] <%Joestar1890> Any Epilogues?
[8:05:31] <%Divantae> it's been a while
[8:05:33] <Heyestus> Just make 8
[8:05:34] <%Dragon_Batman> That's a really good track
[8:05:34] <%indig0bird> They might remake the Revelations series with less horny on main
[8:05:35] <Valentinius_Anodyne> RE4 Remake just becomes DMC
[8:05:36] <%KingVantq> @PatStaresAt they are probably remaking everything to like up for RE8
[8:05:36] <clintonificent> woah
[8:05:36] <Cole_Mooneyes> Like really how long is the game?
[8:05:37] <%Agami23> now fuck all this, give parasite eve
[8:05:38] <%Aracon_> sure
[8:05:38] <%SirGO0SE> id rather 8
[8:05:38] <Deadbulky> B?
[8:05:38] <Metsfan1000> Carlos mode felt like the prototype for RE4 Remake
[8:05:39] <RichochetForce> Yes, that will happen
[8:05:39] <+RAAAAAINMAKER> The Knife Dodge Shoryuken is dope though
[8:05:40] <%dalishprince> yes,,,,
[8:05:40] <%dekkitout> "You know what they should do?"
[8:05:40] <+michingmallecho> Clair and Leon in R4MAKE confirmed HahaBall
[8:05:40] <+MeatBomb> Thank You CAPCOM
[8:05:40] <%Diana869> yes
[8:05:40] <%tiaramaki> I mean, that'd be nice
[8:05:41] <+PR0swagonist> make him play re6 AGAIN
[8:05:41] <Valentinius_Anodyne> Yes
[8:05:41] <+Mitchellsocks> My favorite Plagas are the ones in Bloodborne
[8:05:42] <+aspirationdeath> duuuude lets just make new re please
[8:05:42] <%professormorrigan> TRUE LUL
[8:05:42] <clintonificent> GREEN
[8:05:43] <doomp12> Regenerator will be Horrific
[8:05:43] <%tusk102> throw the whole game out
[8:05:43] <%Aracon_> I'd be okay with that
[8:05:44] <clintonificent> GREEN SHIRT
[8:05:44] <Dao_Puppy> But it's teh 2nd best game though...
[8:05:47] <%Archphronimos> RE6 Re-DONE
[8:05:47] <%IKilledADeadGuy> That would be too good though
[8:05:47] <+nirvana227> YES
[8:05:49] <+Drfunkenstein7> REMAKE 5 AT THAT POINT
[8:05:49] <BioApple> Do you think RE4R will continue the trend of buff regular zombies or will it stay more arcadey?
[8:05:49] <Duskendawn> There are hints of plagas in the files. "European branch"
[8:05:49] <+jjjdanny> YES
[8:05:49] <%Mekhet09> RE4make will not beat the original. I ALREADY KNOW THIS. Because they'll change the cast and if it's not that cool dumb cheese it's not good.
[8:05:49] <%Xevtes> @PatStaresAt what about remaking RE1 again? i know it be crazy but maybe
[8:05:50] <%Divantae> CHRIS COLOR
[8:05:51] <+Mugen4552> I would be ok with that.. 6 was bad...
[8:05:52] <%StaceMcGate> Remake 6 without 4 or 5?
[8:05:52] <%SoFarFetched> WAIT BUT WHO GRABBED THAT
[8:05:52] <clintonificent> THATS SOME CVX
[8:05:52] <RichochetForce> That will eventually happen, they'll just ignore it like how they ignore CVX.

[8:12:33] <Whiskey_T_Foxtrot> Never.
[8:12:33] <%spiritofmojave> as it should be
[8:12:33] <+ZedSlayer> not even to classic RE3
[8:12:33] <garbageheaphound> WHERE
[8:12:35] <boomstickery> HAT BONER INTENSIFIES
[8:12:35] <amask777> nor should you
[8:12:35] <%StaceMcGate> @SoFarFetched oh yeah, why did he close it? LUL
[8:12:35] <VennyVentus> But original RE3 Jill tho
[8:12:36] <%IKilledADeadGuy> Not even to RE3 classic?
[8:12:38] <+jjjdanny> Best
[8:12:39] <42nfl19> what costumes does carlos have?
[8:12:40] <+budyd> Samurai Edge!!!!
[8:12:41] <%tusk102> best

[8:12:41] <+snugglepuggs> HAT FETISH INTENSIFIES
[8:12:43] <+Jaysky> Blonde Jill :)
[8:12:44] <clintonificent> i prefer BSAA Jill tbh wish that wsa here
[8:12:45] <rosemon5001> @PatStaresAt even for a bikini one?
[8:12:48] <+Jokobeast> This is good for Jillcoin
[8:12:49] <+Mugen4552> I wonder if the points from online mode can go towards the unlockables.
[8:12:50] <%MonsieurHedge> i'd get the mup
[8:12:50] <%Dragon_Batman> Man Pat's boner just creepin in
[8:12:50] <Deadbulky> Inf handgun ammo
[8:12:50] <heartlesshealer> not item space?
[8:12:50] <%DesuDesuDokiDoki> D O G G E R
[8:12:51] <%StaceMcGate> BIG DAMAGE
[8:12:51] <%indig0bird> I mean, duh
[8:12:52] <Duskendawn> Pat stares hat
[8:12:53] <%Teh_Un> Recovery coin so you never have to heal
[8:12:53] <reinbachthe3rd> It takes up inventory though.
[8:12:57] <%Maids4lyfe> doing more damage saves ammo
[8:12:58] <Naho_Saenoki> @42nfl19 Classic, and nothing else.
[8:12:59] <%TheBitingIrish> Buy two assault then
[8:12:59] <venomfury86> Virus? I thought this game is about a curse Kappa
[8:13:00] <clintonificent> re5 brunette jill
[8:13:00] <%kingbaconcrispy> Carlos will get nothing, except is crackhead costume.
[8:13:02] <%SoFarFetched> @StaceMcGate Because Tizz86,Boris,and I were the ones gifting a shitton and Pat said there was no reason for the leaderboard if we were the ones mainly gifting subs.
[8:13:03] <heartlesshealer> yeah I guess
[8:13:03] <%tusk102> @PatStaresAt takes up two slots though
[8:13:04] <Mexrage> pouches for inferno mode is probably the best
[8:13:04] <SeventyForce> Kill fast or live...long?
[8:13:06] <sennoh> "when held"
[8:13:06] <elrey745> NUMBER GO UP
[8:13:06] <%herecomesmong0> BIG NUMBER
[8:13:06] <%Ragin_Asian06> Bet you theres a polygon OG jill costume
[8:13:07] <devil_may_fart> idk why capcom never makes an infinite shot gun
[8:13:10] <Deadbulky> But u dont need to carry ammo if u have inf LUL
[8:13:12] <AzucarExile> Infinite gun tho
[8:13:12] <BlackOrchidKI> Is it possible to unlock everything from the shop?
[8:13:20] <%moogleboy1984> defense coin is useless, just don't get hit 4Head
[8:13:30] <clintonificent> ARRANGE MODE
[8:13:31] <%StaceMcGate> @SoFarFetched I mean fight among yourselves
[8:13:33] <waifoong98> so limited save on inferno?
[8:13:33] <+gibbetterinternet> try nightmare
[8:13:36] <%Dragon_Batman> Oooh wow
[8:13:38] <clintonificent> is it arrange mode or randomized?
[8:13:41] <hhomura> try nightmare blindfolded
[8:13:41] <+darudeampersandstorm> noice
[8:13:42] <%DesuDesuDokiDoki> oooh
[8:13:43] <$hzealot> @PatStaresAt what if on nightmare and inferno you fight nemmy more often
[8:13:43] <%Dragon_Batman> they did it
[8:13:43] <Deadbulky> ''may''
[8:13:44] <boomstickery> woah ok thats not messing around
[8:13:44] <mike2hands> OH jeesus
[8:13:45] <%Zebroneath> What does Inferno do?
[8:13:45] <$hzealot> that'd be dope
[8:13:47] <+ZedSlayer> why is arranged mode only for hard tho?
[8:13:48] <clintonificent> oh okay
[8:13:49] <+nirvana227> LUL LUL
[8:13:51] <TopTierHarley> but no replay value huh
[8:13:51] <jorniev> DID HE FINISHED?
[8:13:51] <clintonificent> still cool
[8:13:52] <Heyestus> now THAT is a replayability add
[8:13:54] <%ha2ken> A range mode
[8:13:54] <%tusk102> is the next one up randomized?
[8:13:56] <+Mugen4552> awe I want Randomizer
[8:13:57] <%dalishprince> he done
[8:14:00] <YaiGameworks> No checkpoints in Inferno
[8:14:03] <%코코꾸라> @PatStaresAt You have a hard limit of 5 saves
[8:14:04] <Guardiansaiyan> @ZedSlayer for the TRUE fans?
[8:14:04] <jacksawjack> No minigame modes?
[8:14:04] <jorniev> DID HE BEAT THE GAME ALREADY?
[8:14:05] <+Tarage> MAKE PAIGE PLAY
[8:14:06] <dan_g_v> he finished his first run
[8:14:07] <venomfury86> Speedrun on Nightmare!!!
[8:14:10] <hhomura> @jorniev yes

[8:14:13] <Tiewolf> Last Of Us 2 Delayed Indefinitely
[8:14:13] <oniwahoo> @jorniev YUP
[8:14:14] <Grandma_Amari> @jorniev Yes
[8:14:15] <Naho_Saenoki> @PatStaresAt Inferno does a different remix, and there's no autosave.
[8:14:15] <%tusk102> @PatStaresAt think they're sticking with the current Chris model for future games?
[8:14:15] <ScreamLord> JILL MUST DIE
[8:14:16] <Grennold> Fve saves in inferno iirc
[8:14:16] <jorniev> DAMMIT
[8:14:17] <Guardiansaiyan> @jorniev yes
[8:14:19] <%Divantae> I hope the boxes sometimes explode

[8:14:40] <graemecrackers2> Remix!
[8:14:41] <%코코꾸라> @PatStaresAt If you save more than 5 times, your run will not count
[8:14:42] <Tiewolf> Have Paige play!!
[8:14:44] <TopTierHarley> Time to play Resistance huh
[8:14:47] <Grandma_Amari> This looks like a fun game, but not quite as good as RE2 honestly.

[8:15:18] <%j0ustar> game looks great, but those animations in the endgame cutscenes need a good patch
[8:15:27] <+darudeampersandstorm> oh yeah they do
[8:15:29] <reinbachthe3rd> Seeya, fam - off to the dream realm.
[8:15:38] <Zantetzuken> HahaSleep

[8:15:41] <venomfury86> Doom Eternal still the best game this year :)
[8:15:42] <Guardiansaiyan> Going to watch the scene where Brad is barely sane as he eats marvin

[8:16:29] <%strugglepunk2> Bannerlord and P5R
[8:16:29] <Toast0> so how long did it take for pat to beat the game
[8:16:30] <%Partialrecall2> world of horror got mod support patched in
[8:16:31] <%j0ustar> last area seems a touch rushed out the gate too. Nest could've been a tad larger as well
[8:16:40] <Sanyle> Jesus christ
[8:16:41] <%strugglepunk2> I couldn't have gotten quarentined at a better time
[8:16:46] <+darudeampersandstorm> tru
[8:16:49] <Guardiansaiyan> @j0ustar it litterally looked like a budget Nest
[8:17:40] <$Zalthia> Was this in development along side remake2?
[8:17:45] <KazairLux> perfect timing for Max
[8:17:51] <theredfox930000> yee
[8:17:54] <PrettyPepperoni> probably shortly after
[8:18:09] <%j0ustar> @Guardiansaiyan something tells me the budget or time ran out on the last area. The hospital is very fleshed out and then Nest goes flat
[8:18:22] <jorniev> i want a cvx remake way more than a remake of 4, but i can see a remake of 4 existing
[8:18:22] <theredfox930000> I honestly believe capcom didn't know what to do with re3
[8:18:33] <tacostarvedbeast> ready for some re3 with pat the boy boivin
[8:18:50] <theredfox930000> but It's good just give me re8
[8:19:01] <+Crimznking> wha happun?
