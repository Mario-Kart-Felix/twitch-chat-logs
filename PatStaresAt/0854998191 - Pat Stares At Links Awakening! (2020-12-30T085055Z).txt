[0:35:02] <%ShinobiPhoenix> Tarin and Marin are both in Ocarina, along with that Evil Luigi
[0:35:05] <Pookiedaexzile> Link writes his name on all his stuff
[0:35:06] <%brachydios777> How would people feel about a souls like Zelda game?
[0:35:09] <+ghostfaceninja_> my fav: OOT, MM, TW, WW, BotW in that order
[0:35:10] <2017y> mario is far from the only cameo here
[0:35:11] <%coreyyotto> it's a nice chest
[0:35:13] <+天使42199> it's too buff for the switch
[0:35:14] <WordsHere> Oh shit, you don't have to equip the shield and use it as an item?
[0:35:14] <%angel949> that Mario's other brother Merryo
[0:35:14] <Pookiedaexzile> The Switch
[0:35:16] <tanklets> Finally a stream for the night shift

[0:35:33] <%ShinobiPhoenix> @brachydios777 they already made that, it's called Breath of the Wild
[0:35:33] <2017y> thats a framerate thing that this game has
[0:35:34] <%mikessdd> They all do that! Well most of them.
[0:35:34] <%scwry> They never patched the framerate
[0:35:36] <%sleepy_coffee> It’s midnight, what you doing up
[0:35:37] <DuckyZero> Hmm a souls like LoZ game, seems like it was be interesting
[0:35:38] <+DemonScratch> Did Link write his name on the back of an important historical artiact?
[0:35:39] <%VoidBaronJules> @brachydios777 it'd beat anotherBOTW
[0:35:40] <%yet_another_brony> it cant handle the plastic world
[0:35:46] <%scwry> Its bad outside especially
[0:35:46] <DianaTheAscian> god its so cute

[0:37:57] <Wan6Saber> athHMM
[0:37:58] <%Mendin> Ugh I do NOT like how the edges of the screen blur to vignette everything
[0:37:58] <Geno4344> yes, chain chomps, goombas, kirbies, yoshi, and probably shy guys are all in this game, because SPOILERS
[0:38:04] <+ps4nubian> nice depth of field
[0:38:04] <%angel949> I will say that I absolutely hate the subtle vignette around the screen
[0:38:08] <MamaBedlam> @brachydios777 Pretty sure
[0:38:09] <%Mendin> @brachydios777 You're thinking Mario RPG
[0:38:11] <Geno4344> it's a big hint to SPOILERS
[0:38:11] <+天使42199> @ghostfaceninja_ yeah, more moves maybe - also make weapon durability way less of a pain in the ass
[0:38:16] <arkv01> just like the old days
[0:38:19] <hadokenforyou> Is this the botw font?
[0:38:22] <%scwry> The town here lags pretty badly

[0:38:54] <leinadtonu> At times it feels like watching a stop motion movie...
[0:38:54] <2017y> its cute that pat didnt know about the framerate thing but its killing him
[0:38:56] <+ps4nubian> cyberlink 1997
[0:39:00] <jowi_time> there's a drop in frame rate?
[0:39:00] <jamsbybetty> IIRC digital foundry did a video about this game's wonky performance

[0:39:35] <+ghostfaceninja_> @angel42199, honestly I don't mind the weapon breaking like so many do... but an easy and popular way would be to just make it like Dark Souls and let you repair stuff

[0:40:01] <%Treuan> It was another time

I really needed something to take my mind of things. My cat got hurt by a car fan blade when he snuck out and is in vet ER hospital. Thank you for your streams, specially this stream.
[0:40:18] <Chaos_kun> Snibbeti snab
[0:40:19] <%yet_another_brony> its kinda justified in the twist
[0:40:20] <%Bailey__gaming> classic music kicking in <3
[0:40:21] <%WhereIsWill> what if your just some rando? would you still have to do this wind fish nonsense?!!
[0:40:23] <+天使42199> @ghostfaceninja_ Yeah atleast a way to repair your weapons would be a nice compromise. It just felt like they break so often
[0:40:23] <%TundraOW> Why
[0:40:26] <%ShinobiPhoenix> like who made Leviathan first, Christians or Norse?
[0:40:33] <%scwry> SourPls
[0:40:35] <%mikessdd> That music kicks in at the right time.
[0:40:35] <heart_ablaze> I'm confused about the switch shitting itself like this. last switch game i played was astral chain and that seemed to work fine, or maybe everything was so flashy that I couldn't notice....
[0:40:36] <DianaTheAscian> can u swing to pick shit up?
[0:40:38] <%PaladinDupre> Monkey Bro
[0:40:38] <+twohitgood> link between worlds was a lot of fun
[0:40:39] <+SergeEXE> That IS a good game
[0:40:41] <$happyface699> SLAUGHTER
[0:40:43] <%PaladinDupre> Chimp Chum
[0:40:43] <WigsZone> link Between Worlds is my favorite zelda
[0:40:43] <2017y> im. gonna die until pat discovers slash to pick up rupees
[0:40:44] <CyborgAV> Yeah Link Between Worlds is fantastic
[0:40:45] <DianaTheAscian> ITS THE BEST ONE
[0:40:46] <Blunder_Blue> ALBW has Ravio in it it's raw
[0:40:47] <%DakotaMacDoodle> between worlds is great
[0:40:47] <+ThunderZebraKing> I would love a modern zelda oracle game that finishes the trilogy
[0:40:49] <linSP> that game is now trapped in the 3d portable
[0:40:51] <+LiteralFraud> Link between Worlds is a banger
[0:40:53] <Geno4344> I love the GB installments of legend of zelda because they had the pegasus boots and roc feather/cape
[0:40:53] <father_hill> Link to the past more like link to my asshole, what where they thinking?
[0:40:54] <%Mendin> A Kremlin who sells bananas
[0:40:55] <%PaladinDupre> Pri-Mate
[0:40:57] <+LiteralFraud> Weak soundtrack IMO
[0:40:57] <%ennui_on_me> Link Between Worlds is the best zelda
[0:40:57] <%VoidBaronJules> gonna say it, 2D zelda beats any 3D zelda
[0:40:59] <AFlyingTaco1> I miss The Minish Cap
[0:41:00] <Geno4344> and BOMB ARROWS
[0:41:04] <%superc37> pat whay yhe fuck
[0:41:04] <%brachydios777> @shinobiphoenix Technically Norse but Christians made the name
[0:41:07] <huskarl_zap> croc sus
[0:41:10] <%TundraOW> Pat why are you awake
[0:41:10] <+ps4nubian> this is one of the best looking switch games
[0:41:13] <%TundraOW> Why am I awake
[0:41:13] <%petbeagles_takemoney> It is still super weird to me that they remade this of all games
[0:41:23] <reonome> but its 2d zelda
[0:41:23] <+SergeEXE> @aflyingtaco1 Yo Minish Cap RULES
[0:41:25] <%SirGO0SE> @AFlyingTaco1 if you get an emulator going on your phone, Minish Cap is really fun to play on the go
[0:41:31] <DuckyZero> yeah i remember getting link between worlds and had tons of fun playing it, kind of wish they would make minish cap in this style too
[0:41:35] <2017y> slash to pick up rupees. old janky zelda staple that saves so many steps
[0:41:38] <%Bailey__gaming> byahhhhhh!
[0:41:42] <tanklets> do actual sea urchins have eyes
[0:41:42] <Geno4344> I want to see the oracle games remade
[0:41:43] <$happyface699> Zeldora
[0:41:44] <ChuckMagnus> Reminds me of the ol' four swords musAmmo
[0:41:47] <reonome> does link between worlds count
[0:41:49] <+Milpool> link between worlds is pretty much a link to the past remake
[0:41:49] <%greasypete00> also a link betwen worlds
[0:41:50] <arkv01> oh link to the past is a coomin, we gotta milk em all
[0:41:52] <%ennui_on_me> ALttP will get its remake eventually
[0:41:52] <HollowBeansVG> how do you feel about the visual style?
[0:41:52] <%ShinobiPhoenix> but who decided Leviathan was a long snake dragon instead of a flying whale with wings like Windfish?
[0:41:53] <AFlyingTaco1> @sirgo0se Any recommendations for emulators?
[0:41:54] <%wibbwobbler> still waiting lol
[0:41:56] <%DakotaMacDoodle> between worlds basically
[0:41:57] <%Treuan> Four Swords was the bomb
[0:42:02] <Blunder_Blue> A Link Between Worlds started as an A Link to the Past remake which is why it's basicallythe same world.
[0:42:06] <tanklets> I dont want sea creatures looking at me
[0:42:06] <%bluescalebat> it got a remaster on the gbc but that's about it.
[0:42:09] <%yet_another_brony> we got a decent lttp port on gba
[0:42:12] <Pookiedaexzile> Why remake it when they can sell 50 copies to scalpers on its anniversy
[0:42:12] <rosemon5001> i guess they might want to focus their best on botw2 not remakes... maybe?
[0:42:15] <Chaos_kun> They look like hotdogs
[0:42:15] <%PaladinDupre> Those plants grow like those water weeds in nam
[0:42:18] <%scwry> This games good despite the poor performance
[0:42:20] <+天使42199> @aflyingtaco1 VisualBoyAdvance was the go to for a long time iirc
[0:42:27] <seaechiowai> !uptime
[0:42:27] <@Moobot> I've been playing this game for how long? Oh only 42m 39s.
[0:42:34] <+Memnarch7> Switch hardware very limiting
[0:42:38] <DuckyZero> ooh oracle games would be a nice remake as well, totally forgot about those, even though i just found seasons for gbc a couple weeks ago
[0:42:41] <+ThunderZebraKing> Acorn POG

[0:42:46] <DianaTheAscian> wasn't there a Zelda game about fashion or something?
[0:42:47] <Elky3> Nintendo should stick to 30fps LUL
[0:42:47] <+enternius> SourPls
[0:42:47] <%Mendin> Oh no, this song

[0:43:08] <reonome> tail hole
[0:43:09] <+天使42199> @dianatheascian breath of the wild ? Kappa
[0:43:10] <%ShinobiPhoenix> I am just so used to the Switch, I don't understand being bothered by frame rate stuff like it's REALLY bad
[0:43:12] <+Memnarch7> a tail keyhole is just a buttplug
[0:43:19] <%Mendin> That's the entrance to PlagueOfGripes' house
[0:43:19] <Pookiedaexzile> Bruh why are you confused about the framerate
[0:43:21] <+SergeEXE> LUL
[0:43:21] <Wan6Saber> you would think that Nvidia would've tried harder, with this console....
[0:43:22] <AFlyingTaco1> @angel42199 I'll check that one out. Thanks!
[0:43:25] <Pookiedaexzile> you're playing it on a DS
[0:43:31] <%yet_another_brony> tailhole

[0:43:49] <HollowBeansVG> words are hard
[0:43:52] <%Bailey__gaming> Fun With Bombs
[0:43:52] <%PaladinDupre> a childhood classic
[0:43:53] <%wibbwobbler> yup
[0:43:56] <Pookiedaexzile> I mean the switch is a DS with a Hdmi this shouldn't be that shocking
[0:43:58] <%coreyyotto> I mean there's no voice acting how else are they supposed to make it cinematic?
[0:44:00] <%RadicalWeegee> midna is second best assistent , only bearly behind ghost Zelda in arrmor
[0:44:05] <%ennui_on_me> I've never learned to see the difference between 30 and 60 FPS and I don't want to ruin games for me by doing that
[0:44:05] <DianaTheAscian> my eyes just can't see the frame drops i guess
[0:44:11] <projectcapsule> it's fine as long as it's a steady 30
[0:44:16] <%ShinobiPhoenix> on my PS5, I still can't feel like I am playing better on something claiming to be 60 fps vs 30
[0:44:19] <+ps4nubian> thank god kids are too stupid
[0:44:20] <seaechiowai> @arkv01 call them mustard rice
[0:44:22] <CaptainKarite> We've seen it all

[0:44:44] <%donbomber777> I am a weirdo who can barely tell between 30 and 60 fps as well
[0:44:47] <linSP> thanks tutoral library
[0:44:49] <%argavus> Dont summon the dark one
[0:44:57] <AFlyingTaco1> @sirgo0se And I'll check that one out too. Thank you!
[0:45:10] <%Bailey__gaming> we need the running shoes to get the high book
[0:45:21] <%ShinobiPhoenix> I don't know how to "see" difference in frame rates when playing things, like on my PS5. at least 30 to 60. I watch videos all the time to try and see the difference and still can't
[0:45:23] <crimsonharvest> it was H E L L
[0:45:34] <2017y> slashing rupees will pick them up and save you steps
[0:45:37] <s1rcuit> well this is a surprise
[0:45:39] <+Ether101_Prime> The Color content is in this version too, yeah?
[0:45:45] <%damienlunas> original game had 2 item slots mapped to A and B and your sword and shield each took up a slot.
[0:45:45] <+SergeEXE> Pat you watched Tim do all this, ur not fooling me
[0:45:45] <%WhereIsWill> nice
[0:45:45] <%Mendin> Those three bushes are like the most reliable source of hearts in the game, btw
[0:45:50] <Pookiedaexzile> You See, Nintendo has master the art of Framedrops, You see if the frame rate drops on a Nintendo game its just fine and not a problem, because Nintendo
[0:45:53] <%argavus> But Pat its late in maple leaf land
[0:45:54] <%yet_another_brony> this game solved it with so many shortcuts
[0:45:54] <%DakotaMacDoodle> Zelda games are nice
[0:45:58] <%PaladinDupre> well, that was convenient...
[0:45:59] <sponsoredviewer910> PogChamp didn't see that coming at all
[0:46:00] <%ShinobiPhoenix> Pat is so mean to pets
[0:46:09] <%donbomber777> rabbit
[0:46:11] <+Memnarch7> that was a chicken
[0:46:12] <Pookiedaexzile> Its a very simple system they set up
[0:46:13] <BlueLunecy> Rabbit
[0:46:13] <%Bailey__gaming> attack and dethrone chickens
[0:46:17] <%ennui_on_me> Yeah I keep watching those 30 vs 60 vids (and yes they're set to play in 60 fps) and they mean nothing to me
[0:46:17] <SaltyAzteca> Do not slash the chicken
[0:46:19] <dan_g_v> h3y chat peoplee, why the 4am sttesm?
[0:46:24] <%ShinobiPhoenix> waking up Gief, ignoring Elmo, beating up Chompp
[0:46:28] <dan_g_v> stream even
[0:46:29] <%cobalt_phoenix_> pat what are you doing it's 4 am
[0:46:31] <+天使42199> @shinobiphoenix when you play games you can see that at 60 fps, the animations are typically smoother and the camera will turn smoother (if the game let's you turn the camera) vs 30 fps.
[0:46:33] <%Mendin> Slash the chicken more
[0:46:33] <%ItsCaptainDisco> There was a fan project to raise the Switch's frame rate but Nintendo threatened to sue Kappa
[0:46:34] <%crimsonharvest> did you feel it in your gamer gland
[0:46:34] <Blunder_Blue> @Ether101_Prime Color dungeon is in but the photo man is replaed by the create-a-dungeon.
[0:46:38] <%brachydios777> Framerate setting might be off 60fps in for Twitch viewers
[0:46:39] <%argavus> here we have pat destroying the towns hard work
[0:46:43] <+ps4nubian> O.C.D.

[0:47:35] <+EcchiRider> wait wtf it's 3 am
[0:47:36] <%ShinobiPhoenix> I haven't played a game where playing at 60 made me play better than 30. I am setup to see 60 FPS though
[0:47:37] <+Memnarch7> lol good luck
[0:47:40] <%PaladinDupre> Y O S H I
[0:47:44] <%brachydios777> If it doesn’t look like 60fps, check your settings
[0:47:44] <%cobalt_phoenix_> so is this pat staying up late or waking up early

[0:59:22] <Animorphimagi> yeah. they failed in the remake. it's supposed to be the least chill zelda game
[0:59:24] <2017y> everyone likes 2d zeldy
[0:59:30] <TallGuyWithAHoodie> it's super chill until like 80% of the way into it when the twist drops
[0:59:33] <extradopeness> I love this game
[0:59:33] <2017y> the fishing game is p hard
[0:59:33] <Hellarussian> Link Goes Fishing

[1:00:03] <2017y> the fishing game is v not chill
[1:00:04] <+Ether101_Prime> This game's so screwy, its kind of sad the guy behind a lot of these things doesn't get to work on Zelda any more.

[1:12:00] <arkv01> tanuki mario and his massive nuts
[1:12:01] <DianaTheAscian> piss off bird
[1:12:03] <%crimsonharvest> the wind fish is pogging
[1:12:11] <%ShinobiPhoenix> you can re-listen to clues using the map screen
[1:12:15] <rReizs> egg it up
[1:12:15] <TallGuyWithAHoodie> reminder: there's a reason this game is called "Link's Awakening"...
[1:12:19] <%IncredibleMeh> wind fish needs his vibes man
[1:12:23] <+baedogg> this game has better dungeons than Link to the Past, then again most zelda games do
[1:12:26] <%Alazull> God damn telephones?
[1:12:28] <%ShinobiPhoenix> he sometimes does
[1:12:37] <@SoFarFetched> yippy yo yippy yay
[1:12:40] <TallGuyWithAHoodie> yes avoid the shield eating buttholes
[1:12:40] <jumpyhugs> the butthole that lickcs YOU
[1:12:41] <%brachydios777> Wait a phone?
[1:12:45] <%crimsonharvest> you've still completed zero dungeons so he doesnt have anything new yet
[1:12:46] <rosemon5001> maybe its like you have to go to the library to get new hints? @PatStaresAt
[1:12:48] <%Mendin> Lil Bow'Wow owns this swamp, like Shrek
[1:12:49] <ScreamLord> Why do they always default to Racoon for English dubs/subs? A Tanuki is not a racoon.
[1:12:57] <@SoFarFetched> cause localization
[1:13:02] <%IncredibleMeh> its called links awakening because he awakens to drugs
[1:13:07] <%ShinobiPhoenix> LinkLinks are in the first Zelda
[1:13:09] <@SoFarFetched> "They won't know what a tanuki is,might as well go raccoon"
[1:13:13] <%ShinobiPhoenix> LikeLikes
[1:13:18] <%Mendin> Tanuki is usually a raccoon dog if mor eproperly translated so that's close enough
[1:13:19] <HollowBeansVG> is the combat better than skyward sword?
[1:13:25] <seaechiowai> @screamlord cuz tanuki is a raccoon dog
[1:13:27] <%SvenHolgersson> This camera angle just makes me wanna catch pokemon
[1:13:27] <%PaladinDupre> gonna turn it into a Donegeon
[1:13:32] <+OwlLightningMage> Ginger seeking comp comp is hungry
[1:13:34] <seaechiowai> it's close enough
[1:13:51] <+cascadepersona> I was just watching anime like a goblin and then suddenly Pat is streaming at 2:00 a.m., what
[1:13:52] <%PaladinDupre> LOST RUPPEE COUNT: 3
[1:13:54] <%FreeFuzeIcedTea> @PatStaresAt the kids playing ball there have kinda funny dialogue
[1:13:55] <%ShinobiPhoenix> just like LInk to the past, you can run into trees for those apples and they heal you
[1:14:04] <+OwlLightningMage> This music is bad like all the Rare music LUL
[1:14:09] <TallGuyWithAHoodie> I am convinced ATLUS localized P5S as Striker because "Westernes don't knw about the Shibuya Scramble"
[1:14:10] <+fugatlas> Real Limmy Hours
[1:14:13] <%Dr00_PhD> the new soundtrack is great
[1:14:22] <%brachydios777> But I thought Pat hated good music?
[1:14:43] <%Mendin> In the old gameboy version of this, if you were under the Piece of Power effect and you hit an enemy, they ZOOMED away with a little sparkle trail
[1:14:43] <+LinkaroTwitch> man... the original GB version made that power up feel so powerful...
[1:14:47] <%Mendin> It was goofy, and it owned
[1:14:55] <%ShinobiPhoenix> orchestral music
[1:14:55] <FriendOarFoe> 5 am stream???
[1:14:55] <%Mendin> ^
[1:15:01] <neurokreplica> Time to smack some tail~
[1:15:05] <%WhereIsWill> dungeon time
[1:15:05] <+Beendipz> aww on the gameboy when u had a piece of power they rocketed away and violently exploded
[1:15:10] <%ShinobiPhoenix> recorded using real instruments
[1:15:22] <TallGuyWithAHoodie> @friendoarfoe 4 am, he's been at it for an hour
[1:15:24] <cosmeleon> nice
[1:15:26] <%Rain_Mage> Binding of Isaac time
[1:15:44] <%ShinobiPhoenix> we are on OLD zelda rules
[1:15:51] <DianaTheAscian> thats the link between worlds key or am i crazy?
[1:16:03] <%ShinobiPhoenix> random things doing things they didn't look like they would do
[1:16:11] <monsieurfantastic> yeah exactly the same
[1:16:15] <CaptainKarite> YO
[1:16:16] <BioApple> brain genius
[1:16:16] <subjectg> remember when the compass gave you multiple unskippable text boxes
[1:16:17] <%SvenHolgersson> OMEGA BRAIN
[1:16:18] <%SirGO0SE> genius streamer PogChamp
[1:16:19] <TallGuyWithAHoodie> I fucking love classic zelda dungeons. the divine beasts in BOTW were a huge letdown
[1:16:20] <%SvenHolgersson> HOW DOES PAT KNOW
[1:16:21] <%WhereIsWill> IMPOSSIBLE puzzles
[1:16:22] <%SvenHolgersson> HOLY SHIT
[1:16:23] <CaptainKarite> Get hype
[1:16:23] <+enternius> The puzzles PogChamp
[1:16:24] <Kronark> Pat is so smart
[1:16:27] <DianaTheAscian> WHOA
[1:16:31] <%SABiscotti> We're playing a ZELDA game mother fuckers!
[1:16:35] <%AncelDeLambert> so did they add ANY gameplay or maps, or is this 1:1?
[1:16:36] <linSP> smart brainer
[1:16:37] <%brachydios777> GENIUS
[1:16:39] <%Mendin> Yeah Link's Awakening is between Zelda 2 and LttP so we're old-school
[1:16:39] <%Alazull> Honestly big brain moves here
[1:16:39] <%PaladinDupre> Move over Myst
[1:16:44] <%SirGO0SE> he must be using a guide
[1:16:45] <%brachydios777> Smrt
[1:16:45] <%PaladinDupre> back the fuck up Fez
[1:16:50] <jumpyhugs> brain so winkly
[1:16:52] <%Dr00_PhD> 1:!
[1:16:56] <ScreamLord> Mayup
[1:16:58] <%PaladinDupre> look here The Witness
[1:16:59] <%FreeFuzeIcedTea> @PatStaresAt The game is overall pretty smooth sailing but there's some gigabrain stuff later that gets tricky
[1:17:01] <%ShinobiPhoenix> it's 1 to 1 for the DX version of the game
[1:17:05] <%PaladinDupre> we got a new puzzle king
[1:17:07] <%Mendin> Wow that map is actually detailed, jesus
[1:17:09] <%crimsonharvest> the original didnt do that small pan and zoom when revealing something and the tiny delay throws me off
[1:17:14] <%AncelDeLambert> Nintedo is insane to charge full price, then
[1:17:15] <AdmiralButtloaf> to Peach, stalfos are just playing hard to get
[1:17:27] <%PaladinDupre> I WAS RIGHT
[1:17:29] <Hellarussian> hmm
[1:17:31] <+ShinobiPhoenix> people wanted a remake
[1:17:37] <%SvenHolgersson> THE WRINKLES ON THIS MAN
[1:17:41] <linSP> kill them all
[1:17:41] <%SvenHolgersson> ENORMOUS
[1:17:44] <TioXyco> Huh... those ruppes pickup noises sounds like Yakuza 7 menus
[1:17:50] <%SABiscotti> JOY
[1:17:52] <%mostbrokenrobo> why streaming so late/early?
[1:17:52] <ScreamLord> JOY
[1:17:52] <neurokreplica> JOY!
[1:17:53] <%PaladinDupre> DECOYS LOIS
[1:17:54] <%ShinobiPhoenix> they have asked for something to be done with Link's awakening for years
[1:17:54] <%Mendin> First Dungeon baby
[1:18:00] <%NWR_James> same
[1:18:01] <+enternius> The amount of mini cutscenes in this is killing me
[1:18:01] <Estwilde> Zelda teaches you that killing is rewarded
[1:18:04] <cosmeleon> peepeep puppee
[1:18:04] <+Fabulich> JOY!
[1:18:06] <%SABiscotti> Piss the child
[1:18:07] <arkv01> mmm yess pupper peeee
[1:18:10] <ammobasket> KiLl tHeM ALL LiNk
[1:18:11] <DianaTheAscian> a lot of older zelda games have rooms that are just kill all the enemy's in the room
[1:18:25] <%Dr00_PhD> I really hope they do Oracle of Secrets instead of just doing ages and seasons
[1:18:26] <BuffaTV> yo when did crazy talk become 3D thats so cool
[1:18:29] <DianaTheAscian> hell thats what 70% of zelda 1 was
[1:18:29] <%garagon31> What is this 3AM stream?
[1:18:36] <%Dr00_PhD> if they do more in this style
[1:18:49] <TallGuyWithAHoodie> Dungeon 1: Baby's First Dungeon. Dungeon 8: Hope you have a flowchart handy.
[1:18:55] <+icekept> !uptime
[1:18:55] <@Moobot> I've been playing this game for how long? Oh only 1h 19m.
[1:18:59] <%DeadManProp> Rip and tear Link
[1:18:59] <subjectg> let’s hope they combine the two games into one release first
[1:19:08] <%CalderGaming> CalderGaming subscribed at Tier 2. They've subscribed for 17 months, currently on a 17 month streak! LINK! Why weren't you at elf practice?!
[1:19:08] <@SoFarFetched> the 3D brb screen was made last week by QuietViking,just because he wanted to.
[1:19:09] <ScreamLord> Curse DMCS for preventing us from being able to experience that new Crazy Talk eye catch with the proper music
[1:19:11] <%ShinobiPhoenix> @Dr00_PhD but that misses the whole point of the 3 game format...
[1:19:16] <ScreamLord> *DMCA
[1:19:35] <DianaTheAscian> I wonder if Nintendo even remembers those game
[1:19:45] <%Dr00_PhD> @ShinobiPhoenix fair I just want something new with this art style
[1:19:55] <%ShinobiPhoenix> well considering they only JUST re-released them, yes
[1:19:56] <DianaTheAscian> are they still stuck on the gameboy?
[1:20:01] <%Lindbulmer> Lindbulmer subscribed with Prime. 
[1:20:07] <Shishi1205> oh wow the UK government is live on stream
[1:20:08] <%ShinobiPhoenix> no, they are on 3DS
[1:20:25] <TallGuyWithAHoodie> Oracles are my favorite Zelda game. I would hope they rerelease both as a single game
[1:20:27] <Shishi1205> I imagine people spam LUL when someone gets roasted
[1:20:40] <%ShinobiPhoenix> they made a big deal out of re-releasing them on 3DS too
[1:21:00] <TallGuyWithAHoodie> (Seasons is better than Ages)
[1:21:24] <%Dr00_PhD> ^
[1:21:29] <%ShinobiPhoenix> if they make the Oracles into a single game cart, you still have to have 2 (or 3 if they add Secrets) separate worlds
[1:21:35] <+NomieOhs> alright Pat, I'm following along with you in this dungeon. seems I stopped at the beginning of it. perfect time to pick it back up
[1:21:36] <%SABiscotti> Nope
[1:21:38] <LokirasuSeryk> why is pat awake so late/early?
[1:21:41] <LokirasuSeryk> is this normal?
[1:21:41] <%SirGO0SE> fast pee
[1:21:52] <DianaTheAscian> no
[1:21:57] <@SoFarFetched> yes and no on pat being awake late/early
[1:22:03] <%ShinobiPhoenix> because Ages world is different and different puzzles, people and story, from Seasons
[1:22:04] <TallGuyWithAHoodie> @lokirasuseryk what is normal?
[1:22:14] <%DakotaMacDoodle> She already knows pat
[1:22:20] <%crimsonharvest> violence against skeletons is hot
[1:22:23] <%ShinobiPhoenix> I got to Eagle Tower last I played
[1:22:34] <%Mantorok06> psaLiz
[1:22:38] <neurokreplica> Pat making sure he has no competition when it comes to Paige I see~ :P
[1:22:42] <LokirasuSeryk> i thought he normally streams like during evenings not late night/early morning
[1:22:56] <@SoFarFetched> this is the week of early streams,since paige had two early streams earlier in the week LUL
[1:23:09] <%ShinobiPhoenix> but the game is SO close to the original, and I had the upgraded sword and stuff, so I just didn;t feel I needed to continue even though I was having fun
[1:23:12] <neurokreplica> Mario enemies?
[1:23:12] <LokirasuSeryk> not complaining just surprised to see him online at this time
[1:23:15] <neurokreplica> surely not :P
[1:23:22] <zipfile777> is this clay like reboot?
[1:23:25] <%Maids4lyfe> mario enemies were always in this game
[1:23:27] <%PaladinDupre> Zelda 2
[1:23:31] <%SABiscotti> yo i;m too smoked for this
[1:23:32] <%ShinobiPhoenix> I remember from an interview therewas very specific reasons they used Mario enemies
[1:23:35] <DianaTheAscian> ITS MARIO NOW FUCKER
[1:23:38] <subjectg> just wait til eagle tower
[1:23:40] <%Maids4lyfe> the original Links Awakening did this
[1:23:40] <%crimsonharvest> those sequences were in zelda 1, but only ever had Bats
[1:23:51] <+drflatface> Patrick it's 5AM lol
[1:23:52] <$spardanwarrior> Oh sweet a jump button
[1:24:00] <TallGuyWithAHoodie> JUMP MAN
[1:24:04] <%Dr00_PhD> again zelda 2
[1:24:04] <%ShinobiPhoenix> I think it was like because this wasa test game that they weren't supposed to release and did anyway
[1:24:07] <subjectg> roc’s cape best item
[1:24:10] <%AncelDeLambert> wait, Pat's never played this?
[1:24:19] <+WhatTheFlox> wow
[1:24:20] <%NWR_James> HOISTED
[1:24:21] <+Deko_> LUL
[1:24:21] <@SoFarFetched> he never had a gameboy
[1:24:22] <%Livelinne> psaBlind
[1:24:23] <%ennui_on_me> Pat didn't have a gameboy
[1:24:23] <Pookiedaexzile> No it runs just fine, It has Zelda AND Nintendo on the box
[1:24:25] <%nrocinu777> nrocinu777 subscribed with Prime. They've subscribed for 2 months, currently on a 1 month streak! Hey!
[1:24:26] <%AncelDeLambert> wasn't there a jump in To The Past as well?
[1:24:26] <%WhereIsWill> nailed it
[1:24:30] <%PaladinDupre> LUL LUL LUL LUL LUL
[1:24:30] <@SoFarFetched> unless you mean the switch version
[1:24:34] <%PaladinDupre> Thanks for the 2020MaskUp @nrocinu777
[1:24:34] <Pookiedaexzile> That means all the techinical stuff is imagined
[1:24:35] <%CalderGaming> pat was a sega kid
[1:24:36] <%IncredibleMeh> lytBODIED
[1:24:40] <%mostbrokenrobo> LUL
[1:24:41] <%ShinobiPhoenix> so the mario enemies were placeholders for the test game, but they just said fuck it and kept them in
[1:24:52] <%AncelDeLambert> oh no Pat's mised out on EVERYTHING!
[1:24:54] <+Jaysky> Pat. Why are you streaming at this time?

[1:25:08] <%SABiscotti> Time to unlock....the nightmare
[1:25:20] <%IncredibleMeh> crazy talk will pay pat back for him being extra right
[1:25:21] <%Maids4lyfe> @PatStaresAt zelda game had jump always since 2
[1:25:32] <TallGuyWithAHoodie> It also makes sense for things to be a little weird in this game because spoiler reasons

[1:48:26] <%MegboyManuel> which nintendo tho
[1:48:26] <+Mottyrob> See? Shell!
[1:48:27] <%ShinobiPhoenix> help cute elf boy get in dungeon
[1:48:28] <%damienlunas> You saved the dog's life so now he's your dog. He owes you a life debt.
[1:48:32] <%PaladinDupre> that whole floor is chain chomp shit
[1:48:37] <ChocolateMoofin> bow wow gonna save the world right now now
[1:48:44] <%MegboyManuel> thats kind of an ugly dog, ngl
[1:48:45] <s1rcuit> @PatStaresAt she's lending you the dog to help you
[1:48:59] <%crimsonharvest> do chain chomps shit? i though they just get bigger
[1:49:03] <%PaladinDupre> did you look at it?
[1:49:06] <DianaTheAscian> god do i not miss trade quest
[1:49:06] <Zetheos> well, yeah
[1:49:09] <Explodincatz> not wrong
[1:49:17] <Estwilde> Tim Rogers heard you say that
[1:49:18] <+creamandsugar> you need a lot of shells to upgrade the master sword
[1:49:19] <%NWR_James> There's A LOT
[1:49:19] <%MegboyManuel> Man i wish my dog would eat passerbys too
[1:49:22] <Geno4344> what do you think the chains are made of?
[1:49:24] <%damienlunas> There are 50 I think, and they have incremental rewards
[1:49:27] <Broken_Sonex> Yeah. So?
[1:49:34] <%ShinobiPhoenix> that's good, enjoy getting all 50
[1:49:34] <TallGuyWithAHoodie> I super miss trade quest, trade quest is rad
[1:49:39] <ammobasket> well yeah, it's a miniaturization of Link to the Past
[1:49:40] <ChocolateMoofin> maybe bow wow turns into a giant pac-man demon monster like the thing from Fosters Home for Imaginary Friends The Movie
[1:49:53] <%Monkeyweed21> is Bow Wow's chain just a string of anal beads?
[1:49:55] <%ShinobiPhoenix> and in this case, they DO give you something
[1:49:56] <jumpyhugs> conspicuous ground circles
[1:50:05] <%Kouseo> why we up at this time
[1:50:16] <+Mottyrob> What if Bow Wow was a weapon in Hyrule Warriors?
[1:50:16] <Tampaoster> the only thing you are crushing is the framerate
[1:50:18] <%ShinobiPhoenix> it's NOT celeste at all, the Seashells actually give you important shit
[1:50:18] <Tampaoster> hahaha
[1:50:18] <%MegboyManuel> i regret reading that
[1:50:19] <%NWR_James> dig THE SWAMP
[1:50:20] <TheFranss> Water is too POWERFUL
[1:50:20] <ChocolateMoofin> @monkeyweed21 anal chains!
[1:50:20] <%PaladinDupre> its the water
[1:50:28] <%PaladinDupre> the water is tanking the frames
[1:50:32] <TallGuyWithAHoodie> is fine
[1:50:33] <Zetheos> I'm surprised it hasn't been patched to run gooder by now
[1:50:34] <%ShinobiPhoenix> though I saw the last rewards are pointless
[1:50:34] <s1rcuit> chain chomps and yoshis are apex predators
[1:50:37] <%ShinobiPhoenix> said
[1:50:39] <subjectg> those are some fucked up anal beads then
[1:50:42] <Pookiedaexzile> No Pat Nintendo doesn't do anything wrong, the Switch is just as powerful
[1:50:45] <%MegboyManuel> oi @ssaryn where are you, Pat's shitting on nintendo
[1:50:49] <%TheNewJapanGuy> Nintendo don't even know what a framerate is
[1:50:55] <+creamandsugar> pegasis boots?
[1:50:56] <%ShinobiPhoenix> but the middle and second to last items are important
[1:50:58] <RetributionP> didn't it say lift?
[1:51:05] <%donbomber777> Do I hear "Nintendo bad"?
[1:51:07] <%ShinobiPhoenix> powder
[1:51:10] <AdmiralButtloaf> powder lights fires
[1:51:16] <%crimsonharvest> if those are torches then its powder
[1:51:17] <DrLinezax777> Why is pat up this early
[1:51:17] <+hpman100> I wish I knew what you meant about the frame rates. I can't tell at all looks fine to me
[1:51:18] <%ShinobiPhoenix> you can light that stuff with the powder
[1:51:20] <+michingmallecho> What if it can't be patched to run better Kappa

[1:56:08] <%VoidBaronJules> a nes but juiced up
[1:56:12] <%ShinobiPhoenix> and really, it's Zelda 3 in the normal format since Zelda 2 is that platformer
[1:56:15] <rosemon5001> does pat hate the owl statues or whut
[1:56:35] <neurokreplica> Pat is no friend of birbs!
[1:56:36] <Tampaoster> these 2d sections always made me amazed
[1:56:43] <jumpyhugs> i thought they feltlike juiced up LTTP dungons
[1:56:46] <%ShinobiPhoenix> and Game Boy was basically a Famicom
[1:56:46] <TioXyco> oh yeah!
[1:56:53] <ChocolateMoofin> imagine if they did something similar to snes remix but with this game and metroid fusion
[1:56:54] <AdmiralButtloaf> HINOX

[2:08:00] <%ennui_on_me> that one on the other end of that one room
[2:08:00] <%wibbwobbler> you left one behind
[2:08:01] <+MrStardustRicon> back at the beginning?
[2:08:03] <Tampaoster> its back there in the shyguys room
[2:08:03] <%Bailey__gaming> a small pat sized key
[2:08:04] <%crimsonharvest> 2-3 screens right
[2:08:09] <TioXyco> ray trace your steps then
[2:08:09] <%TundraOW> @Broken_Sonex Become airplane
[2:08:16] <TheMoenia> would you just break down the door in an escape room?
[2:08:21] <%ShinobiPhoenix> @Pookiedaexzile but you don't want to solve that puzzle...
[2:08:24] <%DedlokPM> @ennui_on_me that was literally a puzzle. Even if they give you the answer to solve it is still a puzzle
[2:08:25] <ammobasket> yay!
[2:08:28] <%Livelinne> I'm so proud of you
[2:08:30] <%caramelatte1> wtf reasonable stream time for overseas is this?
[2:08:37] <%NWR_James> Isnt that escaping?
[2:08:38] <Tampaoster> Pat has a dumb high iq of 189
[2:08:42] <%TundraOW> Isn't getting kicked out technically escaping
[2:08:43] <pi_in_the_sci> That sounds like escaping to me
[2:08:47] <%crimsonharvest> I'll make an escape room where the final solution is to kool-aid man your way out
[2:08:48] <BlueLunecy> That's a chickenshit answer
[2:09:06] <%Das_Bass> Das_Bass subscribed at Tier 1. They've subscribed for 25 months! 
[2:09:17] <rReizs> would pat suffer from apophenia in a puzzle room
[2:09:27] <%Bailey__gaming> Beaky Blinders
[2:09:48] <%damienlunas> It's surprisingly easy to kool-aid man your way through a US household considering how many of them use Drywall.
[2:10:00] <%ShinobiPhoenix> wouldn't you have to rebuild the wall every reset?
[2:10:08] <Tampaoster> Drywall is so fragile
[2:10:12] <%TundraOW> My advice is wear elbow pads if you're crashing through walls
[2:10:29] <Explodincatz> very
[2:10:29] <Tampaoster> make a house made of bricks americants
[2:10:30] <BlueLunecy> The only think keeping us from kool-aid manning walls is that we gotta pay for the holes
[2:10:32] <+ShinobiPhoenix> it is a Game BOy game
[2:10:33] <$spardanwarrior> Welcome to game boy games
[2:10:34] <TioXyco> it was a GBC game, so... makes sense
[2:10:35] <%damienlunas> or maybe you're just an Alpha Gamer
[2:10:37] <DrBadyear> i mean it's a gameboy game
[2:10:37] <%caramelatte1> its a VERY short game
[2:10:38] <Pookiedaexzile> Its a GBa game
[2:10:39] <theanora1> it was a GB game
[2:10:40] <ammobasket> Game Boy
[2:10:41] <rosemon5001> hoping you will finish it

[2:10:57] <Broken_Sonex> WECOM TO A GAMEBOY GAME
[2:10:58] <%WhereIsWill> ALPHA GAMER PAT psaDab psaDab
[2:11:03] <Explodincatz> no color gameboy game
[2:11:03] <%TundraOW> Game goes faster with modern graphics, controls, and years of context
[2:11:04] <%ShinobiPhoenix> also there was no internet back them... and 4 AA batteries
[2:11:06] <%caramelatte1> Maybe a little longer than RE3R though
[2:11:08] <%wibbwobbler> short n sweet imo
[2:11:16] <jumpyhugs> AUTO BLOW
[2:11:17] <%Bailey__gaming> FUCKIN CLOWN
[2:11:19] <Pookiedaexzile> No its A gameboy Color Game
[2:11:20] <valriot> Its got a decent amount of secrets, but its a cosey 5-6 hour
[2:11:22] <$spardanwarrior> Can't have your games be long when you gotta use them batteries
[2:11:22] <Cactuskris> duh
[2:11:23] <rosemon5001> ohh noe a gay clown
[2:11:23] <BlueLunecy> Alpha gamer Pat brute forcing this children's game
[2:11:27] <%DedlokPM> It was a game boy game. They had to make sure people could beat the dungeons in battery life time
[2:11:27] <%cowardman93> yes I very much think of pat when I think of zelda, not yakuza, ff14, resident evil, silent hill. zelda
[2:11:32] <+Juriasu> SourPls
[2:11:35] <bleugh> ...that's a boss i guess
[2:11:36] <Pookiedaexzile> No, its a Gameboy Mini game
[2:11:39] <s1rcuit> oh no it's a sterotypical!
[2:11:51] <Broken_Sonex> @caramelatte1 I would legit want to test that,
[2:11:52] <Pookiedaexzile> No, its a Gameboy SP game
[2:11:52] <%ShinobiPhoenix> it's a Game Boy game, remade into a game boy Color game remade into a Switch game
[2:11:53] <Tampaoster> i prefer the original soundtrack this remix suck
[2:11:55] <%IncredibleMeh> ew a gross clone
[2:11:56] <AdmiralButtloaf> reminds me of the Space Pirate song from Metroid Prime
[2:12:00] <%NWR_James> "Oh no, why would I have said that out loud!?"
[2:12:00] <+Mottyrob> Catgirl clown goes Nyah
[2:12:07] <%crimsonharvest> I love this guy, he looked great in black and green
[2:12:18] <Pookiedaexzile> No, its a NEW DS Lite game
[2:12:19] <%VoidBaronJules> nah its a gameboy micro game
[2:12:21] <%SABiscotti> It does
[2:12:24] <JowiJoestar> minish cap is so good
[2:12:25] <s1rcuit> my sister LOVED Minish Cap
[2:12:28] <BlueLunecy> Now that's a good take
[2:12:28] <%VoidBaronJules> darn tootin
[2:12:28] <Explodincatz> minishcap was just as basic as this one
[2:12:29] <%crimsonharvest> teh capcom zelda
[2:12:30] <pizza_oven3000> it is amazing
[2:12:31] <%Monkeyweed21> as long as they remove kinstones
[2:12:33] <%ShinobiPhoenix> well, besides being LOCKED to 3DS if you had Ambassdor
[2:12:33] <+thefishofwar> minish cap is great
[2:12:35] <+WizoSavage> Pat are you ok?
[2:12:40] <%damienlunas> protip, if you're a boss and you have to fight a hero, just tell them to eat shit and start swinging.
[2:12:40] <%ShinobiPhoenix> @PatStaresAt you still have a WiiU don't you?
[2:12:44] <Pookiedaexzile> Waiting

[2:13:14] <TallGuyWithAHoodie> NIGHTMARE SLAIN
[2:13:15] <%ShinobiPhoenix> the actually reason to have a WiiU is all those Virtual Console games that are locked to it

[2:13:55] <%Maids4lyfe> conch
[2:13:56] <$spardanwarrior> rhymes with bonk
[2:13:59] <%Maids4lyfe> like CRONCH
[2:14:00] <%ennui_on_me> @ShinobiPhoenix yet another thing that makes the wii u superior
[2:14:02] <%ShinobiPhoenix> now take him home
[2:14:08] <+Juriasu> back in framerate swamps
[2:14:09] <Pookiedaexzile> A Cooch Conch
[2:14:16] <%greasypete00> isn't the cronch sound also public domain
[2:14:17] <AllonBachuth> Minish Cap has such a slow start where every little things needs to be explained and handed to you even after the first dungeon's over
[2:14:18] <%ShinobiPhoenix> it's not superior, just has some things still
[2:14:20] <Pookiedaexzile> A Conch of a Cooch
[2:14:20] <Tampaoster> Frame rate dying holy geezus
[2:14:20] <rReizs> basically blighttown

[2:14:24] <cholesteroid> go to tal tal heights the remix in this game rules
[2:14:28] <%CzeekyPlays> Seems like Pat is blowing through this game? Or is this a normal pace for this game
[2:14:42] <subjectg> there’s a lotta stock sounds in this one
[2:14:44] <%crimsonharvest> you can try the phone hint guy, i think he updates after bosses
[2:14:48] <%cowardman93> is the chain chomp just zangief?
[2:14:49] <%Dr00_PhD> Pretty normal
[2:14:54] <TallGuyWithAHoodie> @czeekyplays its normal, this is a gameboy game
[2:15:01] <Pookiedaexzile> This is just a pokemon cave
[2:15:04] <%crimsonharvest> it was in the forest
[2:15:04] <Pookiedaexzile> I swear
[2:15:04] <%Dr00_PhD> forest

[2:15:14] <neurokreplica> just go down
[2:15:15] <$spardanwarrior> Cave in forest
[2:15:19] <%ShinobiPhoenix> it's a normal pace for a game from 1993 on the one of first two portable systems ever (and the other wasn't Game Gear)
[2:15:22] <+NomieOhs> the log in the forest
[2:15:34] <%crimsonharvest> i can pay attention because i've had my medicine
[2:15:40] <%Bailey__gaming> @PatStaresAt talking of skulls what's peaches feelings on Stelphos?
[2:15:48] <%CzeekyPlays> I just remember ALTTP being suuuper long but I guess that was SNES
[2:15:55] <%FreeFuzeIcedTea> How you liking it so far, Pat?
[2:16:06] <pi_in_the_sci> There's another log tunnel in these woods you can reach now
[2:16:23] <%crimsonharvest> LTTP has 11 major dungeons depending on what you count?
[2:16:24] <%ShinobiPhoenix> I feel like Peach would still hate evil Skeletons... how does she feel about Skeleton King from Diablo?
[2:16:43] <%crimsonharvest> this ~music~
[2:16:46] <neurokreplica> Tal tal heights theme is baller~
[2:16:46] <%VoidBaronJules> was 3d world the wii u one or 3ds?

[2:16:49] <%crimsonharvest> the tal tal heights soundtrack is the best

[2:16:53] <Pookiedaexzile> Stop the Cap
[2:16:55] <%Dr00_PhD> wii u
[2:17:00] <%VoidBaronJules> both were great either way
[2:17:02] <+WizoSavage> I'm noticing how long it's been since I last played a new proper nintendo game on my own
[2:17:03] <%WhereIsWill> that was pretty much a jaden smith tweet LUL
[2:17:07] <Chaossheep> 3d world was the wiiwuu one with the cat suits

[2:17:42] <neurokreplica> nope
[2:17:44] <Pookiedaexzile> Did he just make a chicken noise
[2:17:45] <DidacticTactic> that was the funniest fucking sneeze i've ever heard

[2:19:45] <%SirGO0SE> dead 2
[2:19:47] <neurokreplica> It means you're ina game
[2:19:51] <%ShinobiPhoenix> I forgot if you can get in this early though
[2:19:51] <s1rcuit> it means their soul is destroyed and they stop existing
[2:19:52] <LVL1_Scumbag> It just means you're an exorcist
[2:19:58] <+pkmamsters> big bow lady
[2:20:00] <%SUTTONSOMEGA> SUTTONSOMEGA subscribed at Tier 1. They've subscribed for 13 months! "Pat, please go to bed." I say as It's currently 5am and I still have a couple more hours until I need to sleep.
[2:20:02] <%WhereIsWill> what is dead may never die!
[2:20:03] <Pookiedaexzile> If you can kill a ghost that means you got big dog status it aint no secrect
[2:20:05] <%DukeBlack_> Excorcising
[2:20:08] <theanora1> you can kill those ghosts
[2:20:18] <jumpyhugs> sword has ectoplasm on it
[2:20:24] <%ShinobiPhoenix> can you get in Color Dungeon this early?
[2:20:37] <%crimsonharvest> desecrate that shit
[2:20:43] <%damienlunas> dig?
[2:20:49] <neurokreplica> @ShinobiPhoenix Don't think you can brute force the push solution tho
[2:20:54] <cholesteroid> ya you can do color dungeon as soon as you get to this area
[2:20:55] <RetributionP> dig Graves link
[2:20:56] <s1rcuit> @PatStaresAt I'm surprised you're playing this game, what with all of the temporary buffs
[2:21:17] <+ps4nubian> Hewey is red pilled asf
[2:21:33] <%damienlunas> push sideways?
[2:21:40] <neurokreplica> also what 5 pushes with 4 directions are A LOT of combinations
[2:21:40] <%crimsonharvest> This is how the ghosts worked in Zelda 1
[2:21:50] <Chaossheep> Isn't there a secret thing in one of these spots wher eyou get special armor
[2:21:52] <%ShinobiPhoenix> so if you know the Grave number solution, you can get in?
[2:21:57] <Chaossheep> or am I misremembering
[2:22:03] <+Juriasu> monkaS
[2:22:04] <AllonBachuth> that grave just called you a cowar
[2:22:09] <AllonBachuth> coward
[2:22:12] <%crimsonharvest> dig under the shoved one? this is actually just a hunch i dont know if theres something
[2:22:17] <bleugh> the ghosts hate it, one weird trick to pulling graves
[2:22:19] <%ShinobiPhoenix> @Chaossheep the Color Dungeon is what we're talking bout
[2:22:22] <+DarkOnyx7> "The way will not open for cowards" *stays closed* LUL
[2:22:31] <Chaossheep> yeh
[2:22:37] <+GimmMeASammich> because you need Choppers to fight for you
[2:22:41] <Chaossheep> good stuff that was
[2:22:49] <neurokreplica> wrong praire
[2:22:52] <%Monkeyweed21> Link is still a virgin
[2:22:53] <ammobasket> Tri-hard
[2:23:01] <%crimsonharvest> The prarie is several screens, try right from town
[2:23:01] <Cactuskris> waynon yeah to bring martin to brother joffrey
[2:23:20] <TheMoenia> fun fact: in the german translation of the original game boy game, after you put some magic dust on one of the green slimes with legs, they would tell you some very interesting hints like "Never without a condom!", "Do you have any sorrows, hardships or problems?", "!STOP THE WAR! GIVE PEACE A CHANCE!!" and "Give me your juice, I'll give you mine..."
[2:23:23] <%Bailey__gaming> will you sell them by the seashore tho?
[2:23:26] <%ShinobiPhoenix> it's 6am, even Max isn't streaming
[2:23:39] <TallGuyWithAHoodie> link knows about the three seashells
[2:23:40] <+Juriasu> same
[2:23:43] <+ps4nubian> why cant we fight Pos in marryo brothers
[2:23:48] <BuffaTV> same :/
[2:23:49] <%Alazull> Agreed
[2:23:55] <+WizoSavage> I also wish Exclusivity doesn't exist
[2:24:02] <+ps4nubian> i want no more heroes 3 on ps5
[2:24:03] <%VoidBaronJules> it looks dope, picked it up on sale cause switch controls suck
[2:24:04] <+WizoSavage> didnt*
[2:24:04] <T_Sasquatch> thats how i feel about every nintendo game
[2:24:11] <%kewlmyc> He's not wrong
[2:24:13] <JoveGar> youre gonna be feeling that again with monster hunter Rise
[2:24:18] <+gimmickypizza> Yes Pat I know what your saying
[2:24:19] <%damienlunas> Not true, low-impact indie games are nice on the switch because portable.
[2:24:19] <neurokreplica> @T_Sasquatch Aye~
[2:24:21] <Broken_Sonex> That's how i felt about the Wii
[2:24:28] <RetributionP> that's like saying Nintendo makes subpar merchandise
[2:24:33] <%ShinobiPhoenix> @PatStaresAt so what you mean is... you wish someone ELSE has actulally paid foro the game... that is why we have Bayonetta still at all, since everyone else said no
[2:24:36] <TheFranss> oh yeah you can make your own dungeons with this iirc
[2:24:37] <Pookiedaexzile> You know what else is portable
[2:24:38] <T_Sasquatch> if theres one thing about nintendo its that their exclusives are amazing
[2:24:40] <%crimsonharvest> skip this shit and use a guide if you care about 100% othewise i say leave
[2:24:41] <%Nobrev> but i like handheld mode
[2:24:41] <%SABiscotti> This part isn't great from what i hear
[2:24:42] <jumpyhugs> @TheMoenia neat!
[2:24:42] <%Monkeyweed21> the Anti-Pat feature
[2:24:48] <+gimmickypizza> Portable not really a great benefit imo
[2:24:51] <%damienlunas> This mechanic fucking blows
[2:24:51] <s1rcuit> Nintendo would make so much fucking money if they made Zelda Dungeon Maker
[2:24:51] <%Zundelle> just release an upgraded switch so I can play at a revolutionary stable 30 fps
[2:24:56] <+Juriasu> Nintendo atleast adapts their games to fit the switch but every other developer just says "fuck it, 720p 30fps it is"
[2:25:10] <%wibbwobbler> really don't want to wait another year for a switch pro
[2:25:11] <Pookiedaexzile> You know what else is portable? That Bullshit so miss me wit it
[2:25:12] <%ShinobiPhoenix> it;s like everyone forgots Nintendo and Sony both pay for stuff that often people say no too
[2:25:21] <Pookiedaexzile> Can play Hades on a damn laptop if I need too
[2:25:27] <+ps4nubian> im getting the KFC version of Bayo' 3

[2:36:26] <AdmiralButtloaf> saying the dog food has juicy beef makes me want to eat it
[2:36:27] <%Garthunox> Pat I'm gonna be honest, this is a very surreal experience watching you at 11:30 am
[2:36:36] <Vyskus> It was a gameboy game
[2:36:37] <%ShinobiPhoenix> it's not half the game though
[2:36:42] <%Alazull> That's super fucking coconuts
[2:36:42] <cholesteroid> you do a lot of backtracking
[2:36:49] <TheMoenia> how many dungeons have you done?
[2:36:49] <+thefishofwar> yup
[2:36:54] <%TundraOW> Link's awakening? This will hardly make it to breakfast
[2:36:55] <%ShinobiPhoenix> and it's a GAME BOY game
[2:36:55] <+Xooler67> @garthunox try watching him at 0627
[2:36:59] <jumpyhugs> what shinobi said
[2:37:02] <KaijuWorldOrder> OOOOOAAAH*UHHGH
[2:37:02] <%Axellogic> But it is the 5 am
[2:37:09] <+BettyMwwaahh> alot of backtracking but its still ot worth $60
[2:37:12] <%ShinobiPhoenix> people who wanted a remake got exactly what they wanted
[2:37:13] <%TriA_l> dungeons have maps too
[2:37:13] <%caramelatte1> It's only worth half its price
[2:37:14] <%TundraOW> How much does this cost?
[2:37:15] <AdmiralButtloaf> naners
[2:37:16] <%Axellogic> Oh BANANA
[2:37:17] <%wibbwobbler> nintendo lol
[2:37:17] <Broken_Sonex> Yeah, this game is fucking peanuts
[2:37:18] <$ggbhtg> oooooh ba NAN NA
[2:37:21] <%crimsonharvest> It's not that weird, at this point both Zelda 1 and LTTP had mostly open maps, having it on the map doesn't really tell the whole story
[2:37:25] <cosmeleon> now imagine if they were CANNED bananas
[2:37:28] <+gimmickypizza> it's not
[2:37:32] <powerprotoman> 94 canadian
[2:37:33] <%Sol_Install> not worth
[2:37:34] <%LastnameSilverLastname> SCAMMED
[2:37:35] <lastrin> Oh no....
[2:37:37] <Pookiedaexzile> Its not
[2:37:37] <LVL1_Scumbag> Yeah, but that's in monopoly money
[2:37:37] <Vyskus> It's worth it if you have enough nostalgia LUL
[2:37:39] <%ShinobiPhoenix> I feel like it was just on sale...
[2:37:39] <%Kaask> its not worth 60 either
[2:37:41] <Pookiedaexzile> Its not worth 40
[2:37:43] <fosh0> LOL
[2:37:44] <+GimmMeASammich> but your 94 is our 60
[2:37:48] <%Monkeyweed21> this game should be 30
[2:37:50] <%ItsCaptainDisco> Why is Canada so weird
[2:37:53] <lastrin> But...health insurance?
[2:37:53] <FeelsBadPat> WHAT near 100 dollars for a gameboy game LUL
[2:37:54] <%TundraOW> This should've been $5
[2:37:54] <Pookiedaexzile> NO NINTENDO CANT BE BAD
[2:37:54] <Hanzmolman> I paid 30 and that was too much
[2:37:55] <+Mottyrob> Yeah at that I'd be looking towards piracy
[2:37:55] <%Sol_Install> it worth 10 bucks usd
[2:37:56] <TheMoenia> just as worth it because that would be equivalent?
[2:37:59] <cholesteroid> epic canada moment
[2:38:03] <TallGuyWithAHoodie> TRADE QUEST PART 4 - BANANAS ARE UNBREAKABLE
[2:38:06] <%AnIcedCoffee> I played the original for free, that's good enough for me.
[2:38:10] <15zelda1> epic quebec taxes moment
[2:38:18] <%Bailey__gaming> PRehaps there is a monkey?
[2:38:18] <AdmiralButtloaf> arent PS5 games $69.99 USD now?
[2:38:20] <%caramelatte1> This is a $30 game dressed up as a $45
[2:38:25] <%ShinobiPhoenix> Yes, it was on sale LAST month
[2:38:27] <+gimmickypizza> it's worth canned bananas
[2:38:28] <%wibbwobbler> it'd be fine if prices dropped over time
[2:38:29] <%Bmrandfriends> pat im back and sucessfully working
[2:38:33] <Vyskus> I think 40 is fair for this, but I happily paid 60 imo
[2:38:36] <%AnIcedCoffee> This remake is still $80 here and I don't want to pay that
[2:38:40] <+Mottyrob> Hey do more fishing but not because it's f un
[2:38:47] <%Garthunox> And then he's like "I'LL KILL YOU!"
[2:38:56] <+ps4nubian> fellow Ont

[2:41:24] <$ggbhtg> SON NA
[2:41:24] <%ArtyArtorias> TheAngryArtist I agree that this game isn't worth the price, but using sale prices as an argument isn't good
[2:41:30] <Broken_Sonex> Made for all the Pat's out there!

[2:43:20] <TheAngryArtist> @artyartorias Even if you paid full price for a game like DQ it will last you 50+ hours instead of this game which might give you 20.

[2:51:08] <%ArtyArtorias> @Pookiedaexzile I was saying that comparing sale/discount games isn't a good example. Tales of Symphonia for $10 doesn't make it a worse game.

[2:54:26] <%crimsonharvest> there was a cool dupe glitch in the original game that made them really funny
[2:54:50] <RetributionP> the sea shells unlock concept art.

[3:01:13] <cosmeleon> hi bye
[3:01:33] <%ShinobiPhoenix> I like this next part

[3:02:07] <+kumaprime> is this normal or master mode?
[3:02:14] <%wibbwobbler> psaDogchamp
[3:02:15] <%ShinobiPhoenix> normal
[3:02:27] <%ShinobiPhoenix> and they haven't done a Master Mode in forever

[3:03:17] <+kumaprime> oh yeah, hero mode. I don't know where I got master mode from
[3:03:19] <%Monkeyweed21> @ShinobiPhoenix master mode is BOTW
[3:03:25] <%ShinobiPhoenix> to me, Master Mode is the alternate map stuff like in Zelda 1
[3:03:35] <CrimsonGargoyle> but dog allways happ

[3:04:17] <+kumaprime> ugh... my brain is dumb this early in the morning
[3:04:24] <%Dr00_PhD> nice one genius
[3:04:26] <%ShinobiPhoenix> @Monkeyweed21 it's not the same thing, just using the name, which i hate. Master Mode used to be alternate maps (or reversed maps) with new enemy placements

[3:12:02] <%Axellogic> help my cat is climbing me
[3:12:07] <VritraReiRei> @PatStaresAt Good morning Pat! How are you liking the game? Have you played the original?
[3:12:22] <%ShinobiPhoenix> @crimsonharvest 50 instead of 40
[3:12:31] <TioXyco> you'll need a fuckton more, it seems
[3:12:33] <ItamarZel> European stream! PogChamp
[3:12:34] <%ShinobiPhoenix> sword is not the max
[3:12:36] <%crimsonharvest> in the first game there were more than enough
[3:12:37] <cholesteroid> just enough
[3:12:37] <VritraReiRei> @PatStaresAt more than enough
[3:12:42] <%Dr00_PhD> more than enough to get the good stuff
[3:12:43] <%Monkeyweed21> more
[3:12:48] <%ShinobiPhoenix> I think Sword is like 30 or 40
[3:12:50] <jumpyhugs> the sword is 2nd last reward i think
[3:12:54] <%ShinobiPhoenix> but the max is 50
[3:12:58] <$ggbhtg> more than enough to kill anything that moves, huh?
[3:13:13] <PulverKong> i wonder what gief is thinking of
[3:13:15] <%crimsonharvest> (kill a goomba like mario would)
[3:13:21] <%Alazull> He snek
[3:13:26] <$ggbhtg> Sneak King
[3:13:27] <%Alazull> This is sneking mission
[3:13:27] <%ConLin_Arts_> is that a Nut
[3:13:33] <+DeaconBluesClues> ANOR LONDO
[3:13:35] <%Alazull> Equipment must be secured on site
[3:13:42] <jumpyhugs> dirt circle up top
[3:13:54] <%ShinobiPhoenix> yeah, Sword is 40, but there are 50 shells
[3:13:58] <%Axellogic> boom

[3:14:17] <cosmeleon> arent these just people
[3:14:24] <TheMoenia> yes
[3:14:24] <%ConLin_Arts_> man those knights are useless
[3:14:32] <%exileshadow03> that front flip animation looks awkward from the side
[3:14:47] <%ShinobiPhoenix> 15 shells is the items that detects other shells
[3:14:48] <%crimsonharvest> how you gonna scare the crow
[3:14:51] <$ggbhtg> @ConLin_Arts_ nope, link is just better :)
[3:14:51] <%ShinobiPhoenix> item^

[3:15:27] <%ConLin_Arts_> I want to pet gief
[3:15:37] <%ShinobiPhoenix> it's not murder if they attack you first
[3:15:39] <%Alazull> Good morning and later y'all
[3:15:41] <$ggbhtg> you murdered that non-murder of crows
[3:15:59] <%ConLin_Arts_> LUL
[3:16:06] <%wibbwobbler> doodWat
[3:16:13] <NoirePanzer> We love you GIef!
[3:16:13] <%ShinobiPhoenix> oh... REAL tip, use Powder on those floating skull things with glowing balls
[3:16:13] <$ggbhtg> THE Gief?? From PatStaresAt on Twitch?!?! PogChamp
[3:16:19] <+RyTYoung> I would happily mush Zangievs face together
[3:16:22] <%cowardman93> gief such a good stimky boy
[3:16:26] <%Axellogic> There food in his dreams why would he wake up
[3:16:37] <sychevatel> his little tongue..........
[3:16:37] <%cowardman93> thats bulldogs
[3:16:37] <otakon17> grant unto me , the squishy boy
[3:16:41] <$ggbhtg> Big cat energy from that dog
[3:16:42] <PulverKong> THE GIEF from TV
[3:16:50] <%ConLin_Arts_> he lives the right life, eat, sleep and poop
[3:16:55] <AkumaHokoru> you are awake early good sir
[3:16:55] <%ShinobiPhoenix> They are called "Anti-Fairies", guess what happens if you use Powder on them
[3:16:58] <otakon17> LOOKIT HIM
[3:17:05] <otakon17> HE'S ALL RUBBER AND SQUISH
[3:17:18] <AkumaHokoru> And have been for some time apparently lol
[3:17:35] <otakon17> "Well THAT backfired"
[3:17:57] <%ShinobiPhoenix> not those
[3:18:01] <%Daniel_Is_I> Not THOSE enemies
[3:18:03] <jumpyhugs> not those ones
[3:18:06] <%Daniel_Is_I> The X-shaped guys
[3:18:07] <s1rcuit> pretty sure you need the boomerang
[3:18:10] <%ShinobiPhoenix> the skulls with 4 balls
[3:18:11] <otakon17> WHY does the game always insist on giving you a Piece of Power AFTER you kill the last enemy in the room is beyond me
[3:18:18] <TheMoenia> not those. the ones that bounce from wall to wall
[3:18:18] <%ShinobiPhoenix> no powder, for sure
[3:18:27] <otakon17> The fireskull lookin' dudes
[3:18:47] <jumpyhugs> floaty diagonal dudes
[3:18:48] <%ConLin_Arts_> huuuh
[3:18:48] <%ShinobiPhoenix> Anti-Fairies can be turned into real fairies, it's an old Zelda trick
[3:18:54] <%ConLin_Arts_> a pot door
[3:18:54] <+DeaconBluesClues> throw shit at it
[3:18:58] <%crimsonharvest> there was no glyph on the door in the game boy version
[3:18:59] <%za7az> Hmmmm
[3:19:06] <DrBadyear> "a game for babies"
[3:19:09] <otakon17> Kanalet Castle
[3:19:11] <RetributionP> needs time stoo
[3:19:16] <otakon17> I do NOT remember this location
[3:19:21] <%Monkeyweed21> how can this be
[3:19:22] <%ShinobiPhoenix> when you need health, you throw powder on them, some games you can just kill them with an item. like the Boomerang in this
[3:19:29] <%ConLin_Arts_> LUL
[3:19:42] <$JojoPiero> damn was that a dank nut
[3:19:45] <%ShinobiPhoenix> the game hasn't told you who Richard is since you ahven't met him
[3:19:52] <otakon17> God this game looks gorgeous though
[3:19:56] <%Monkeyweed21> pre dungeon
[3:20:00] <%ConLin_Arts_> Richaaaaaard
[3:20:03] <otakon17> He met Dick
[3:20:11] <neurokreplica> Always pay attention to Dick~
[3:20:12] <otakon17> okay WHY is Dick short for Richard?
[3:20:22] <otakon17> how did we as a species reach that conclusion?
[3:20:24] <AkumaHokoru> blame old school language
[3:20:27] <%Dr00_PhD> I have always wondered that
[3:20:29] <%ShinobiPhoenix> I did not see that, I went ot hte bathroom, I also did the castle without meeting Richard
[3:20:31] <%king_wragles> Ah, I see there won't be a stream later lol. Morning folks
[3:20:31] <otakon17> I hear dat 'Gief
[3:20:31] <PulverKong> Why is Bob short for Robert?
[3:20:33] <jumpyhugs> LET'S PARTYYYYYYYYY
[3:20:42] <AkumaHokoru> richard -> dick is a thing from like the 60s
[3:20:43] <otakon17> he snor
[3:20:51] <%ShinobiPhoenix> also Richard is a reference to the game this game is based on
[3:20:51] <%wibbwobbler> sus
[3:21:03] <otakon17> always loved the feather that lets you jump
[3:21:04] <$ggbhtg> what kind of name is Ed for a horse?
[3:21:30] <otakon17> What kind of name is Ed for a man?
[3:21:37] <%ConLin_Arts_> LUL

[3:21:55] <otakon17> go SLOWLY
[3:21:55] <%crimsonharvest> no man could ~ever~ cut all this grass
[3:21:56] <TheMoenia> having to be patient, pats hardest challenge
[3:21:59] <AkumaHokoru> because "rich" wasnt a name and "rick" was what they went with but for some reason rick and dick became attached and then suddenly richard = dick
[3:22:02] <otakon17> also, spin slash
[3:22:07] <%bardocckk> goodnight everyone
[3:22:20] <%king_wragles> Anyone else get some static? Trying to make sure it was just me
[3:22:26] <neurokreplica> too much pot (holes) for Pat~

[3:22:35] <%crimsonharvest> you can hop 2 i believe in you
[3:22:38] <otakon17> you cheesed!
[3:22:39] <AkumaHokoru> it is
[3:22:44] <%ShinobiPhoenix> Richard is a character from Kaeru no Tame ni Kane wa Naru. the game Link's Awakening is spiritually-based on
[3:22:59] <+illusiveSaint> the potfield could be helping the economy atpSuspect
[3:23:10] <PulverKong> Ok weeb
[3:23:12] <%ConLin_Arts_> is that the From Whom the Frog Bell Tolls?

[3:23:32] <otakon17> God this looks like a diorama
[3:23:40] <Tempmael> almost halfway to that bow and arrow
[3:23:46] <otakon17> I love the "toy" look they went for this game
[3:23:47] <AkumaHokoru> it is a nice presentation
[3:23:58] <otakon17> Zanchonk
[3:24:07] <AkumaHokoru> saves money on animation too i assume

[3:24:45] <%Picia000123> It's so nice to look at a dog, I don't get that post
[3:24:48] <PulverKong> I'm sure there were death threats too
[3:24:49] <sychevatel> sad people with no joy in their lives
[3:24:52] <BuffaTV> he is cat
[3:24:53] <RushUnplugged> there's some fuckos in the sub that really fucking hate your guts but CANNOT help but keep watching and bitchin
[3:24:53] <otakon17> Goddamn that's a LOTTA Moblins

[3:24:56] <BuffaTV> therefor he must scream
[3:24:56] <%Bailey__gaming> He Yell!
[3:24:57] <AkumaHokoru> there are people who hate animals. my foster mom thought animals didnt have souls.
[3:24:59] <otakon17> also I hear that Elmo
[3:25:00] <%crimsonharvest> if you were smart you'd be screaming too
[3:25:00] <Flame_Water> hating on someone for having a dog is pretty stupid to begin with
[3:25:01] <@SoFarFetched> they probably didn't like the dog getting attention on screen.
[3:25:03] <Tampaoster> say hi to paige
[3:25:03] <%ConLin_Arts_> don't be sad baby
[3:25:07] <jumpyhugs> you can tell a lot about someone by their attitude towards furbabies

[3:25:26] <s1rcuit> @RushUnplugged the Internet in a nutshell
[3:25:26] <%ConLin_Arts_> he looks sad
[3:25:34] <AkumaHokoru> My foster mom was like if they werent a bird/fish or something that lived in ta cage it wasnt allowed because animals didnt have souls.
[3:25:34] <%wibbwobbler> psaElmo

[3:26:32] <otakon17> Man, wait till Gief is like 10x Elmo's size
[3:26:32] <RushUnplugged> Gief stop eating Elmo's butt and he will like you
[3:26:45] <otakon17> and he'll be like "I love you and you're gonna TAKE IT"
[3:26:45] <s1rcuit> I don't hate Gief, I hate that he makes Elmo not want to be on stream
[3:26:49] <neurokreplica> "Dad, I wanna play with the samll angry dog!"

[3:26:56] <%cowardman93> elmo make me want cat, gief make me want dog, my apartment say no pet
[3:27:00] <Broken_Sonex> Those people just hate that the dog takes up stream time as he should because baby good.
[3:27:03] <PulverKong> so do dogs go straight for the ass on other animals aswell?
[3:27:05] <Tampaoster> DIG UP COWARD
[3:27:11] <%ShinobiPhoenix> 15 gets you the Shell Radar
[3:27:16] <AkumaHokoru> dogs go straight for the ass on everything
[3:27:24] <%ShinobiPhoenix> and then the true Mind Goblins will come out
[3:27:25] <fruitloop89> @thalchampz I can dig it.
[3:27:25] <AkumaHokoru> cats do it too but they are more sneaky about it
[3:27:29] <%ConLin_Arts_> even the leg ass
[3:27:31] <PulverKong> reddit is just a hate fueled cesspit anyway
[3:27:41] <neurokreplica> Don't forget that sticks are pretty good at knocking down bee hives~
[3:27:43] <%ShinobiPhoenix> as it did for me
[3:27:46] <RushUnplugged> @PulverKong jokes aside, dogs do associate smells to individuals and butts are quite smelly
[3:28:07] <neurokreplica> straight up
[3:28:10] <%ShinobiPhoenix> I super forgot who the stick goes to
[3:28:14] <%Monkeyweed21> dig up

[3:30:52] <neurokreplica> after buying bombs you unlock it as a droppable thing
[3:30:55] <otakon17> Use a bomb?
[3:30:56] <%ShinobiPhoenix> you NEED a lot of fuck bombs here
[3:31:06] <cosmeleon> oh wow
[3:31:14] <otakon17> those ARE bom-bombs
[3:31:18] <%Dr00_PhD> not quite
[3:31:22] <%ShinobiPhoenix> I would prefer normal Bobombs to those
[3:31:22] <PulverKong> @kikoeru_san he wanted to strim yesterday but kept nodding off and his Guardians (paige and plague) sent him to bed
[3:31:24] <+YPFrost> id fuck a bomb

[3:45:10] <%ShinobiPhoenix> very much
[3:45:15] <%VoidBaronJules> sword and shield included
[3:45:15] <otakon17> yeah originally you had to assign EVERYTHING to the A/B buttons
[3:45:17] <DartAran> yup, even your shield and sword
[3:45:22] <%Daniel_Is_I> The fuckin pitter-patter LUL
[3:45:22] <otakon17> even the SHIELD
[3:45:29] <$floralkami> wtf, why are we so early today?
[3:45:33] <Dutchpotato> Dude the fact that they never updated the game to give the feather it’s own button infuriates me so much
[3:45:34] <%ShinobiPhoenix> thing was, you could mix up things weird combos
[3:45:41] <Dutchpotato> It’s like the most used item in the game
[3:45:47] <%ShinobiPhoenix> like Bomb and Bow made exploding arrows
[3:45:50] <$floralkami> all these fucking brit-ish
[3:45:52] <%VoidBaronJules> it was a smaller version of the Oot Water dungeon
[3:45:53] <otakon17> I love the noise Link makes
[3:45:56] <Sunstalker> What is Paige streaming tomorrow? It can't be Dark Souls 3, she knocked that out over the fall. FeelsGoodMan

[3:46:09] <%ShinobiPhoenix> @Dutchpotato but what button would you assign it to?
[3:46:31] <otakon17> HEY
[3:46:33] <%ShinobiPhoenix> I suppose Left Stick Push could work
[3:46:34] <otakon17> YOU CAN RUN NOW
[3:46:38] <PulverKong> i think this shit was what made me put down the game 2 years ago
[3:46:44] <otakon17> I wonder if there was something you couldn't get before
[3:47:03] <otakon17> When in doubt, BOMB
[3:47:17] <%VoidBaronJules> yay you figured it out
[3:47:25] <%VoidBaronJules> bomb walls sound different
[3:47:26] <%Daniel_Is_I> Oh no, illusory bomb-walls
[3:47:27] <Dutchpotato> L2 or R2 are just duplicates for other buttons, unless I’m crazy @shinobiphoenix
[3:47:32] <otakon17> shortcuts!
[3:47:34] <Dutchpotato> Just use one of them
[3:47:41] <kikoeru_san> get in the hole

[3:47:41] <@Moobot> I've been playing this game for how long? Oh only 3h 47m.
[3:47:48] <%ShinobiPhoenix> you have the easy answer for this
[3:47:53] <otakon17> this sound design is great
[3:47:57] <Morbidmort> I wonder if Pat remembers the words "long Jump"
[3:48:16] <otakon17> give him time
[3:48:16] <%ShinobiPhoenix> I wonder they give you so much room for that jump
[3:48:30] <soapwrecker> no
[3:48:34] <%VoidBaronJules> no, its adorable
[3:48:35] <otakon17> no that's absolutely wholesome
[3:48:36] <s1rcuit> him or you?
[3:48:38] <TheMoenia> thats very normal

[3:48:41] <@Moobot> I've been playing this game for how long? Oh only 3h 48m.
[3:48:47] <+corrosivePaladin> yea because i expect the dog would fart anytime you squished him
[3:48:50] <+MrKerb> Nice European time stream
[3:48:51] <%PinkertonDanPie> u fall asleep or the boy?
[3:48:52] <kikoeru_san> nah Pat that's fucking adorbs
[3:48:56] <%Bmrandfriends> does zengief agressivly snuggle with u at nigh like my dog
[3:49:03] <jumpyhugs> "fellas, is it gay to love dogs?"
[3:49:08] <%wibbwobbler> he probably enjoys that i imagine
[3:49:14] <%YakumoYomi> Oh Jesus...you actually started streaming at 4am
[3:49:16] <otakon17> it's a one way tackle
[3:49:54] <otakon17> oh great the compass...the LAST thing to get
[3:49:56] <BuffaTV> :)
[3:49:56] <%Bmrandfriends> the cum pass
[3:50:13] <%Picia000123> The best "fellas" I saw was a guy saying that telling your wife that you love her is gay LUL
[3:50:14] <otakon17> one more key needed
[3:50:19] <%ShinobiPhoenix> yeah, i guess L-ZL, R-ZR are just "comfort positions" for Shield and Dash, maybe they didn't want to make people have to get used to using one, which is stupid, since you have so many buttons in BOTW
[3:50:32] <neurokreplica> Are you a genius and a wordsmith and a voice of all the generation too?
[3:50:41] <otakon17> yeah that's a neat thing about ALL the dungeons in this game I always got a kick out of, ALL the dungeons are shaped in a certain way
[3:50:42] <+Deko_> nobody cares about screenshots right
[3:50:48] <kikoeru_san> has GMTK done an episode on this one
[3:50:54] <%ShinobiPhoenix> but I guess this is supposed to be one of the "early easy Zeldas"
[3:51:06] <psilent_p> is resident evil level design all that different from a resident evil game?

[3:56:30] <otakon17> and NOW you have enough keys
[3:56:50] <otakon17> exploration and platforming
[3:57:02] <jeppeww> "a series of combat challenges" is a bit of an understatement, that shit is fucking stupid hard
[3:57:08] <+corrosivePaladin> yea Godhood could have been done better but i still enjoyed it
[3:57:12] <%ShinobiPhoenix> isn't tthat kind of old school though? (not that I disagree with you)
[3:57:20] <otakon17> no new areas
[3:57:20] <Zayasu> what frustrates me whenever i hear hollow knight is giantbomb ignoring it mostly and wondering why anyone would play that instead of dead cells LUL
[3:57:21] <kikoeru_san> I don't think I've even found the extra content despite getting mega lost all the time
[3:57:26] <%Daniel_Is_I> Combat in HK is a means to an end and the dream bosses were enough for me.
[3:57:31] <%VoidBaronJules> the combat drags the experience personally
[3:57:34] <neurokreplica> sprint into him!
[3:57:39] <valriot> Yeah like imagine a Metroid with a boss rush. Its fun but like... thats not what Metroid is.
[3:57:45] <otakon17> RUN at him
[3:57:48] <neurokreplica> :O
[3:57:50] <otakon17> dat face
[3:57:53] <%Daniel_Is_I> D:
[3:57:59] <+Jaysky> The last DLC is also very unforgiving making any sort of casual players attempts to see the new bosses very difficult.
[3:58:05] <T_Sasquatch> playing hollow knight was weird for me because it felt like you could infinitely hop on enemies but it was really hard to do so
[3:58:10] <%mighty_max_t> that big red block was when you shove the q-tip in to deep
[3:58:25] <kikoeru_san> YEAH
[3:58:30] <%Monkeyweed21> eww no
[3:58:33] <$floralkami> @zayasu dead Cells is great, but it sure as hell ain't no HK
[3:58:37] <kikoeru_san> I watched my friend do that shit
[3:58:41] <otakon17> God I hate Keese
[3:58:44] <%Daniel_Is_I> I don't even remember what you get from Path of Pain
[3:58:48] <%Daniel_Is_I> I did it, but I don't remember
[3:58:49] <lastrin> Path of Pain was probably strongest point in hollow knight too
[3:58:50] <Vaardvark> mister mushroom is the true true secret ending
[3:58:51] <+Jaysky> You gotta go through 3 different boss rushes to unlock THE boss rush of every character and only after beating all the bosses can you unlock all the new fights.
[3:58:52] <%ShinobiPhoenix> I feel I have more fun in Dead Cells
[3:58:52] <+corrosivePaladin> ohman. I wish i could do path of pain blind again
[3:58:53] <jeppeww> the true final ending doesn't really bother me, since it's just a different short cutscene
[3:59:01] <kikoeru_san> Cells is better than HK only because you can't get lost
[3:59:02] <%ShinobiPhoenix> but they are different experiences
[3:59:08] <+corrosivePaladin> You get a cutscene showing why Knight was a poor host
[3:59:09] <kikoeru_san> that's just me tho
[3:59:13] <%crimsonharvest> you feel like a badass when you're pogoing off saws
[3:59:17] <otakon17> HE IS
[3:59:20] <otakon17> THE BLOB
[3:59:20] <lastrin> I think Path of Pain was how you did a step to get to the true final boss
[3:59:21] <+BettyMwwaahh> its a challange. its okay that you dont like or ccant do it
[3:59:21] <+illusiveSaint> sounds like there's a lot of chalice dungeons in hollow knight
[3:59:23] <jumpyhugs> god I wish I could do Katamari blind again
[3:59:23] <%LastnameSilverLastname> Imagine having to go through Path of Pain to fight Radiance and there's no bench at all along the Path of Pain so if you die to Radiance you have to do the entire Path of Pain again
[3:59:28] <%Daniel_Is_I> Quickly, hit it with Metal Slash
[3:59:28] <$hooppawesomeness> oh no, not THE BRAND
[3:59:33] <T_Sasquatch> oh boy , its titan souls
[3:59:36] <%crimsonharvest> how about that eye
[3:59:42] <%ShinobiPhoenix> Dead Cells just roguelite Castlevania and Hollow Knight is actual normal progression based Metroid
[3:59:42] <%crimsonharvest> oh gross
[3:59:47] <otakon17> GO FOR THE SPRINT!
[3:59:49] <%crimsonharvest> did it always do that
[3:59:55] <theanora1> Did you see how Slowbeef's Kingdom Hearts slow as balls playthrough had him playing a Disney Villian dating sim?
[3:59:58] <%TheCallousKing> Hello! from a pathology lab in England
[3:59:59] <%Daniel_Is_I> Charge the center?
[4:00:00] <otakon17> yes
[4:00:03] <+dante_must_die_exe> sprint his asshole
[4:00:04] <%ShinobiPhoenix> split them up still
[4:00:05] <otakon17> THE MIDDLE PAT
[4:00:05] <neurokreplica> slice him in two!
[4:00:08] <$floralkami> DC sucks compared to HK cause you can't get utterly lost in a cavern you have no business being in yet
[4:00:32] <+pectusumbra> gotta dash through them if I remember right
[4:00:38] <timdtoolmantaylor> fulliEyeL fulliEyeR fulliW fulliSideEye fulliSad fulliPain fulliPat
[4:00:38] <TheMoenia> remember its a game for babies
[4:00:48] <T_Sasquatch> you did it
[4:00:48] <TheAngryArtist> WutFace WutFace WutFace NotLikeThis NotLikeThis NotLikeThis
[4:00:49] <kikoeru_san> no your just slow
[4:00:49] <otakon17> now the TRUE FIGHT BEGINS
[4:00:56] <+pectusumbra> it's a little finiky
[4:00:57] <kikoeru_san> like very slow
[4:00:57] <%Daniel_Is_I> You were kinda off-center but yeah you bounced
[4:00:58] <+corrosivePaladin> you kept running to the side so it wouldnt split
[4:00:59] <+dante_must_die_exe> don't even worry about that
[4:01:00] <DartAran> yeah you have to hit dead middle
[4:01:01] <otakon17> man these guys have AMAZING air control
[4:01:05] <%crimsonharvest> your sword never poked the skinny bit
[4:01:10] <NitronStreams> it looked pretty finicky
[4:01:10] <Dutchpotato> Yeah u were a pixel off and the game said no
[4:01:21] <%josstil> Do it better
[4:01:21] <%FacetiousAF> this man has lost his goddamn mind
[4:01:28] <$floralkami> I still can't believe this Zelda has a jump
[4:01:28] <T_Sasquatch> PREY SLAUGHTERD
[4:01:30] <+Jaysky> As much as I love HK's combat and I'm a sucker for difficulty, the true end stuff is masochistic
[4:01:30] <%crimsonharvest> its very strict isnt it
[4:01:31] <timdtoolmantaylor> missmadsRollout missmadsRollout missmadsRollout missmadsRollout missmadsDAB missmadsNOM missmadsLOVE
[4:01:32] <%Monkeyweed21> NIGHTMARE SLAIN
[4:01:34] <otakon17> all da hearts
[4:01:41] <%YakumoYomi> You. Did it.
[4:01:42] <+Jaysky> Well, DLC true end.
[4:01:44] <otakon17> we got a BELL
[4:01:48] <+Jaysky> Regular true end is fine
[4:01:49] <%ShinobiPhoenix> it's weird people calling this a game for babies, like this game wasn't made when the internet didn't exists to tell you the answers to stuff and you weren't spoiled by 20 literal years worth of other games aping this one
[4:01:54] <%Monkeyweed21> you got cowbell
[4:01:54] <+pectusumbra> Fun fact! That's a bell Marin uses in Hyrule Warriors
[4:02:00] <PanicSwytch> Has Pat died yet?
[4:02:02] <NoirePanzer> Phantom Summoning Bell monkaS
[4:02:03] <%wibbwobbler> bell
[4:02:13] <jumpyhugs> that's not how bells make notes
[4:02:16] <otakon17> a waterfall huh?
[4:02:22] <kikoeru_san> I wonder if Mon Him World is done, started the download last time
[4:02:27] <otakon17> man I remember getting STUMPED on this game at several times
[4:02:29] <timdtoolmantaylor> i cant read missmadsROSS missmadsROSS missmadsSIP missmadsBalooROSS missmadsBalooBLESS missmadsBalooBLESS
[4:02:32] <$floralkami> @shinobiphoenix it's a joke, lol. every game can be seen as babby
[4:02:33] <cholesteroid> 0 deaths
[4:02:55] <%ShinobiPhoenix> but other people saying it are being serious
[4:03:02] <AdmiralButtloaf> need the key first
[4:03:04] <$floralkami> unless it's schut gam
[4:03:06] <CosmosDeity> !mic
[4:03:08] <TheFranss> think we went past the waterfall earlier on stream
[4:03:08] <neurokreplica> The DUNGEON might be behind a waterfall, but you still need a key~
[4:03:10] <kikoeru_san> 2 hours to go on the Mon hunt
[4:03:12] <KingVantq> oh he's actual streaming in the middle of the night tdogSmile
[4:03:17] <CosmosDeity> Anybody know what mic Pat uses? Is it Audio Technica?
[4:03:27] <+Jaysky> With no help back in the day I'd get stumped on many a Zelda game
[4:03:30] <%ShinobiPhoenix> I remember how long it took to beat Metroid 2 as a child
[4:03:36] <$floralkami> @shinobiphoenix those people literally are unable to have fun in life. let them suffer
[4:03:43] <otakon17> I adore this snorey boy
[4:03:46] <%ShinobiPhoenix> and how many AA batteries
[4:03:51] <CosmosDeity> Cool thanks. That's the one I was looking at getting funnily enough!
[4:03:55] <$floralkami> making fun of things is the closest they will get
[4:03:55] <%MrGuy516> @patstaresat yo I got a gamer cube for christmas I was wondering if you had any issues with the cushions not expanding to the right size after taking them out of the vacuum seal?
[4:04:00] <%ShinobiPhoenix> I played a LOT of Metroid II
[4:04:08] <neurokreplica> Don't forget to go seep in the village now~
[4:04:09] <otakon17> HE SNORE
[4:04:13] <kikoeru_san> I feel like spending so much time with Woolie has forced Pat to get a good mic
[4:04:17] <TheFranss> oh look a breakable wall
[4:04:20] <%ShinobiPhoenix> Metroid II might be the second game I ever beat
[4:04:21] <+Jaysky> Windwaker was one of my favorite games and I spent like a month just sailing around wondering wtf to do trying to find triforce pieces
[4:04:28] <PanicSwytch> U missed a wall
[4:04:29] <+messentry> oooh come on!
[4:04:34] <+pectusumbra> bomb the wall?
[4:04:38] <TheFranss> @PatStaresAt there's a wall

[4:05:46] <$floralkami> *literally
[4:05:47] <+WizoSavage> sometimes, maybe 25%, so instead of 60 you pay like 45?
[4:05:48] <+DJAllblue> nintendo only does 10% sale and thats it (in my country)
[4:05:48] <%ShinobiPhoenix> someone gave me a site that lets you track sales
[4:05:50] <kikoeru_san> fuck Nintendo
[4:05:54] <PanicSwytch> Only during black friday can u find a nintendo game for $40
[4:05:58] <otakon17> you haven't found it yet at all
[4:05:59] <%crimsonharvest> there are travel options yet to discover
[4:06:03] <KingVantq> So is the Bayo stream still happening today? or is the schedule getting a new rework later
[4:06:04] <%Monkeyweed21> the teleporters are a new addition
[4:06:04] <theanora1> I remember for like 1 glorious year someone convinced nintendo sales were good and they had TONs of sales on the 3DS
[4:06:05] <%YakumoYomi> @Jaysky Same. Black Friday is great for getting first-party Nintendo games
[4:06:06] <%RetroDLC> Nintendo games tend to go on sale digitally for 20%-30% off at absolute most
[4:06:11] <$KamenOtaku> It is literally 10 dollars off at Best Buy right now
[4:06:12] <otakon17> man I love this village theme
[4:06:12] <%ShinobiPhoenix> it gives exact dates for when games went on sale and how long
[4:06:17] <TheAngryArtist> literally going to sell my switch cuz i cant afford games.
[4:06:19] <+cravsa> EU friendly stream time PogChamp
[4:06:24] <+Jaysky> @WizoSavage That's about as big as it gets for them first party unless you get second hand.
[4:06:27] <KingVantq> a fuckin chomp chomp is about to bite Pat's ass again
[4:06:34] <%RetroDLC> RetroDLC subscribed with Prime. They've subscribed for 2 months, currently on a 2 month streak!

[4:06:44] <%YakumoYomi> Deku Deals is great for tracking the price of Switch games
[4:06:46] <%king_wragles> Thanks for the 2020Drop @retrodlc
[4:06:49] <+Jaysky> @YakumoYomi That's pretty much the only time they reliably have a sale on good stuff.
[4:06:54] <cholesteroid> animal village theme is fun

[4:07:24] <%ShinobiPhoenix> well on the sale that just ended, Breath of the Wild was on sale for less than 40
[4:07:31] <+Jaysky> I regret not purchasing Astral Chain cause that seems to never go on sale either

[4:09:57] <%JamesCorck> JamesCorck subscribed with Prime. They've subscribed for 12 months! Hey man, this year sure sucked shit, but since the start of the pandemic I've managed to lose 20kgs, and clear my commission queue twice. And all while having your streams on to keep the boredom away. Thank you for making 2020 bearable, man <3
[4:09:57] <otakon17> thanks for the stream Pat, take care folks
[4:10:01] <%Livelinne> psaDogchamp shnooore

[4:10:19] <NitronStreams> who put their baby on top of a tree in the first place?
[4:10:26] <%ConLin_Arts_> nah it runs good
[4:10:26] <+Jaysky> I'm off. Fell asleep earlier and woke up towards the end

[4:10:55] <PanicSwytch> Astral chain runs great on switch
[4:10:56] <%mighty_max_t> mighty_max_t subscribed at Tier 1. They've subscribed for 22 months! My only Zelda experiences are with Hyrule Warriors and Smash, as I wasn't really a Nintendo kid. It's on my "maybe someday" list but doubt I'll get to most of them. Do you have a major "oh I should really check that out" but know you won't?
[4:10:56] <@SoFarFetched> UK people finally got a chance to watch
[4:10:58] <+WizoSavage> and chat is pretty tranquil
[4:11:05] <+Gamblor69> Your stream was a treat to wake up to today
[4:11:08] <%cowardman93> its 2pm british time
[4:11:09] <+TheotherKristian> Astral Chain runs at 30fps but is still a very fun game
[4:11:10] <%za7az> Thanks for the 2020Glitchy @mighty_max_t
[4:11:16] <%Daniel_Is_I> I missed the first 3 hours because I didn't think you'd actually stream at nightmare hours
[4:11:27] <%cowardman93> wait, 1pm
[4:11:37] <%wibbwobbler> i tried joining but couldn't figure it out lol
[4:11:44] <%Roasted_Pheasant> Mystery Syringe?
[4:11:49] <theanora1> but now there's the new strain
[4:11:50] <LVL1_Scumbag> What if they won't tell you what's in the syringe?
[4:11:51] <%ConLin_Arts_> anti-covid juice
[4:11:52] <Vaardvark> 2021? you mean 2020: episode 1?
[4:11:53] <%FacetiousAF> high hopes i see
[4:11:57] <kikoeru_san> Pat has gotten past his syringe fears
[4:11:58] <%AnneSQF> fill me up, nurse
[4:12:00] <%ShinobiPhoenix> @PatStaresAt I just tweeted you the sale tracking site
[4:12:03] <+DJAllblue> jokes on you in 2021 the world level increases
[4:12:06] <%vincerocmm> psaDab
[4:12:08] <@SoFarFetched> For joining the Sub Discord, you need to manually check your twitch connects and manually connect to pat's discord.
[4:12:08] <%VoidBaronJules> yeah not being in the middle of plague would be a good year base
[4:12:09] <timdtoolmantaylor> i just got re3 its so blurry wtf quackCry quackCry quackCry quackCry
[4:12:14] <Sunstalker> Don't crazy talk it, Pat D:
[4:12:20] <%ShinobiPhoenix> it lets you keep a watchlist of games you are looking to go on sale
[4:12:22] <%Daniel_Is_I> The syringe fear was never about the syringe itself, just the contents. Which is why a mystery syringe is so terrifying.
[4:12:25] <%ConLin_Arts_> BibleThump
[4:12:25] <%FacetiousAF> FUCK?!?!?!
[4:12:30] <PanicSwytch> My only issue with astral chain is the control inputs. it would be better if it was customizable
[4:12:32] <AdmiralButtloaf> but what if the nurse is a hobo
[4:12:34] <@SoFarFetched> give big energy for cat
[4:12:36] <Broken_Sonex> 2021 is just 2020's NG +
[4:12:37] <%ShinobiPhoenix> even set a price you wnat the price to drop below
[4:12:44] <+illusiveSaint> !uptime
[4:12:45] <@Moobot> I've been playing this game for how long? Oh only 4h 12m.
[4:12:49] <KingVantq> how'd your cat touch a car fan blade?
[4:12:58] <gambit_gamble> whats with the early stream?
[4:12:59] <kenny_biff> what fucking mystery its a vaccine
[4:13:00] <%arancet> A hobo lunges at you with a needle. It contains either anti or pro covid juice. What do you do?
[4:13:00] <NitronStreams> Fills with strange hobo juices
[4:13:02] <kikoeru_san> a syringe loot box if you would
[4:13:06] <+WizoSavage> my dog got hit by a car but after a bandage and sanitation of the wound she healed 100%
[4:13:14] <LVL1_Scumbag> What if the only way to get the vaccine is with mystery syringes?
[4:13:16] <@SoFarFetched> Think the mystery is more what's IN the vaccine.
[4:13:17] <%FacetiousAF> no let him sleep psaGib
[4:13:19] <%Daniel_Is_I> @kenny_biff That's why it's not scary to him
[4:13:22] <LVL1_Scumbag> Like a gacha syringe?
[4:13:24] <%ShinobiPhoenix> technically a syringe filled with air is lethal too
[4:13:25] <@SoFarFetched> I don't remember if they listed whats in it
[4:13:31] <enZymeth> Besmooched
[4:13:32] <%Livelinne> PrideRise PrideRise PrideRise
[4:13:36] <%Daniel_Is_I> There's a fish.
[4:13:36] <kikoeru_san> maybe
[4:13:37] <%VoidBaronJules> Marin?
[4:13:37] <@SoFarFetched> they just said "hey covid vaccine,don't worry about it"
[4:13:41] <%ShinobiPhoenix> no, or Ganon... technically
[4:13:41] <AdmiralButtloaf> princess wind fish
[4:13:51] <%Livelinne> oh no LUL
[4:13:53] <%wibbwobbler> there's egg
[4:13:54] <%ShinobiPhoenix> or Triforce or Master Sword
[4:14:05] <%Mantorok06> coxIce
[4:14:05] <kikoeru_san> there is no princess, BUT there is a big whale
[4:14:10] <+DJAllblue> true
[4:14:17] <theanora1> It would suck if one would ever run a country
[4:14:18] <%FacetiousAF> good night gief
[4:14:27] <@SoFarFetched> yeah pat becomes "ewww them,more like mmmmm mee"
[4:14:38] <psimon_> isn't that a sociopath
[4:14:42] <kikoeru_san> yeah they deflect super hard
[4:14:42] <+WizoSavage> is narcissism a delusion derived from something else?
[4:14:43] <%Emperor_Machinus> @KingVantq Cat snuck out and hid inside my dad's truck's engine and my dad just went and turned on the engine
[4:14:45] <+illusiveSaint> true!
[4:14:50] <Sunstalker> We're all trying to find who did this.
[4:14:51] <+TheotherKristian> Sounds kinda like me step mother
[4:15:07] <%mighty_max_t> The worst is "I'm sorry you were offended"
[4:15:14] <kikoeru_san> and they also hold up conversations by talking about themselves too much
[4:15:23] <%ShinobiPhoenix> psychopaths will hide their psychopathy better
[4:15:24] <timdtoolmantaylor> why does pat remind me o a fat beeteljuice quackREE quack10 quackSassy quackCool
[4:15:25] <Broken_Sonex> Reminder: Pat has a thing in brain things
[4:15:35] <+WizoSavage> I forget you studied psychology
[4:15:41] <psimon_> interesting
[4:15:42] <%Emperor_Machinus> @SoFarFetched Thank you
[4:15:43] <%ShinobiPhoenix> sociopaths lose control more easily and publicly and don't care
[4:15:49] <%FacetiousAF> pat studied mind goblins
[4:15:52] <%FacetiousAF> MMMMMMMMMMM MMMeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeee
[4:15:52] <kikoeru_san> sometimes I forget that you have a psychology degree
[4:15:55] <KingVantq> @Emperor_Machinus oh hope he or she recovers soon tdogOwo
[4:16:00] <marvel877> Why am I waking up to Pat about to go to sleep?
[4:16:03] <%ShinobiPhoenix> thus Trump is a sociopath, not a psychopath
[4:16:10] <Thewoodentree> @PatStaresAt Why the fuck are you awake?
[4:16:17] <psimon_> its somebody else's fault is also that person though
[4:16:23] <+illusiveSaint> almost the inability to see one's fault
[4:16:24] <+TheotherKristian> Mmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmm Mmmmeeeeeeee
[4:16:28] <Arek_1> Nihilists are the worst.
[4:16:32] <%FacetiousAF> @Thewoodentree big anime tiddy
[4:16:35] <%wibbwobbler> there it is
[4:16:38] <%ShinobiPhoenix> because he freaks out publicly and absolutely does not care who he affects or hurts
[4:16:42] <%Emperor_Machinus> @KingVantq I am actually leaving just now, I got a call that he just got out of surgery
[4:16:44] <%Garthunox> MMMMMMMMMM ME!
[4:16:50] <kenny_biff> pat showing off them psychology skills
[4:16:52] <+WizoSavage> So is Narcissism a coping mechanism?
[4:17:00] <@SoFarFetched> D:
[4:17:03] <%Garthunox> They can never be wrong
[4:17:05] <psimon_> honesty >
[4:17:10] <@SoFarFetched> geefFat geefFat geefFat geefFat
[4:17:13] <Thewoodentree> @FacetiousAF Should have known
[4:17:17] <%Emperor_Machinus> @KingVantq Also thank you
[4:17:20] <%Bmrandfriends> i mean thats half true
[4:17:24] <%Garthunox> raisedbynarcicists is a great subreddit!
[4:17:25] <+Xooler67> pat having his own Ted Talk at 8am
[4:17:48] <kikoeru_san> only ted talk I need
[4:17:51] <psimon_> Kappa
[4:17:59] <%DeluxeTitties> I have sociopathic tendencies a lot, and its important to remember that people dont often want to be like that. some people cant understand why theyre being an asshole to you
[4:18:01] <Thewoodentree> so no saying sorry?
[4:18:01] <Broken_Sonex> But you're not ugly, Pat. :)
[4:18:09] <+illusiveSaint> "I'm just being blunt" excuse
[4:18:10] <%thewordofhelix> its a prank bro
[4:18:18] <+dante_must_die_exe> well if it wasn't your fault, i wouldn't have to say it obviously
[4:18:19] <$floralkami> I feel like certain people need to hear this more than others
[4:18:19] <%ShinobiPhoenix> or... a President
[4:18:20] <kenny_biff> THATS MY WHOLE FAMILY
[4:18:25] <T_Sasquatch> i just wouldnt bother enganging in a convo that would go that long LUL
[4:18:25] <valriot> And then December 2018 happened
[4:18:26] <sentientvin> Both of my parents are like that and as a kid I had to learn to apologise by getting the shit kicked outta me
[4:18:33] <T_Sasquatch> Engaging *
[4:18:33] <kikoeru_san> man I remember the guy that lost my copy of DMC3 said that shit when I found out he lost it
[4:18:41] <$floralkami> or an entire base
[4:18:44] <+TheotherKristian> Oof to everyone who knows one
[4:18:44] <%ShinobiPhoenix> we're trying... Jan 20
[4:18:45] <rosemon5001> personal experience in the exact situation perhaps?
[4:18:56] <kikoeru_san> he also covered the case in my resin
[4:19:03] <sharrison0921> narcissists: HOW DARE YOU FEEL BAD ABOUT MY INSULT uhg this hits home sooo hard...
[4:19:08] <kikoeru_san> I HAVE THE CASE HE LOST IT
[4:19:09] <$floralkami> man, Jan 20 is gonna be some SHIT
[4:19:10] <@SoFarFetched> It's not like I lost it ON PURPOSE
[4:19:18] <KaijuWorldOrder> ugh, that sounds like a few people i've left behind in my life
[4:19:27] <$floralkami> my dad is definitely like this too
[4:19:30] <psimon_> oh yes, those people are the worst
[4:19:31] <Broken_Sonex> I knew a guy like that. I almost punched him and he flinched.
[4:19:32] <rosemon5001> ohhh fuck i would fucking get the cops on them since i allways keep my reciepts @PatStaresAt
[4:19:35] <%Roasted_Pheasant> Gief doing a big snore
[4:19:38] <+WizoSavage> Never admitting its literally your fault
[4:19:38] <%ShinobiPhoenix> you have told this story....
[4:19:50] <Sunstalker> Why we talking about your brother?
[4:19:51] <kikoeru_san> this guy was also the son of cooperate executives btw
[4:20:00] <Arth__> are we Pats bosses?
[4:20:08] <%ShinobiPhoenix> it's funny that I remmberw ho the story is about
[4:20:10] <$floralkami> I can't even get the dude to admit that the doors are fucked up cause he constantly slams then
[4:20:21] <%Daniel_Is_I> EAT THIS ROCK
[4:20:23] <%Picia000123> The best I heard was "My boss hates me and that's why he fired me, I didn't show up to work ONLY 3 times this week"
[4:20:31] <@PlagueOfGripes> tear ass with no sass
[4:20:33] <%ShinobiPhoenix> would you want Link to talk like The cartoon
[4:20:38] <kikoeru_san> well he's a leftie so freak beast is the normal
[4:20:40] <SolidusA> hes special LUL
[4:20:41] <+Xooler67> @arth__ I think twitch or possibly Amazon is his boss we are his customers
[4:20:45] <%Daniel_Is_I> There's a cutscene from Hyrule Warriors where Link eats rocks and soldiers are cheering him on
[4:20:52] <%ShinobiPhoenix> that would be awesome to me, if just one game, LInk was like Cartoon Link
[4:20:54] <+WizoSavage> It's amazing how long they have gone with a generally mute character
[4:20:54] <%ArcanumArcanum> Link is a bio weapon
[4:20:54] <Arth__> lmao!
[4:20:58] <valriot> Berserk 4 Kids
[4:21:01] <kikoeru_san> he eats nails man
[4:21:01] <+DJAllblue> musou games in a nutshell
[4:21:06] <@PlagueOfGripes> he can cut enemies in two by swinging his sword so hard that the wind around him becomes a sword
[4:21:13] <+SilverDevilfish> "That boy ain't right. But he's strong as shit."
[4:21:14] <%thewordofhelix> @PatStaresAt I mean, if you saw a twink kill like 1000 moblins with a wooden sword you would think the same thing.
[4:21:33] <BreakerDSX> Jesus Christ Link! On the rocks!?
[4:21:34] <Broken_Sonex> That's very cool Plague.
[4:21:37] <%za7az> @ArcanumArcanum This is my new head canon LUL
[4:21:43] <%Daniel_Is_I> "Look we know he's a monster, just give him food and make sure he doesn't point that sword at us."
[4:21:43] <%ArcanumArcanum> ArcanumArcanum subscribed with Prime. They've subscribed for 22 months! Ssaryn smells. That is all
[4:21:49] <$floralkami> @kikoeru_san being a leftie and also a corporate boss' son will put some "made me stronger" in ya
[4:21:57] <valriot> Kiryu LUL
[4:22:04] <+SilverDevilfish> Kiryu
[4:22:07] <%Roasted_Pheasant> SNOOOOOOORF
[4:22:35] <marvel877> 10
[4:22:37] <Thewoodentree> Link is the 1% of heros
[4:22:43] <+TheotherKristian> When are we gonna see Link with glowing actioj energy
[4:22:51] <NitronStreams> LUL
[4:22:56] <%Daniel_Is_I> I'm reminded of how half of FFXIV's story is pointing the WoL at the villain and saying "kill"
[4:22:56] <+illusiveSaint> then it alludes he just goes back to whatever normal life he had after the quest
[4:22:58] <kikoeru_san> @floralkami I wish that guy that lost my DMC3 was a leftie, he's just an asshole tho
[4:22:58] <%ShinobiPhoenix> Link and Atreus would be a good tag team
[4:23:10] <%thewordofhelix> dont forget that one time he was a furry.
[4:23:11] <%ShinobiPhoenix> as long as the fight is off-camera
[4:23:12] <KingVantq> ruby weapon hmmm
[4:23:15] <Arek_1> @PlagueOfGripes Sword beams are more a property of the more magical swords he gets. But spin attacks? Sure, that's all him.
[4:23:20] <+WizoSavage> Berserk manga Link panel but with 2k enemies instead
[4:23:25] <Thewoodentree> So basically, imagine if the Dali Lamma was Goku
[4:23:28] <BreakerDSX> “4th Lieutenant of the Hyrule Clan” Link *thunk thunk*
[4:23:28] <RushUnplugged> he SNORE
[4:23:28] <Kurrisum> and protecting people git to Link killed
[4:23:31] <%AkronymCLT> It's just part of the 9-5
[4:23:34] <%ShinobiPhoenix> taht part were Atreus killed all those Dark Elves
[4:23:34] <Kurrisum> got*
[4:23:36] <%Daniel_Is_I> And then you have to do diplomacy and your character SUCKS at it
[4:23:42] <$floralkami> @kikoeru_san oh, that guy probably grew up to be a blue checkmark on Twitter...
[4:24:12] <%YakumoYomi> @BreakerDSX "HYAA!"
[4:24:14] <%ArcanumArcanum> WoL is just like "yeah let me go grab the bois" and then a few hours later the problem is deleted
[4:24:15] <$floralkami> I reread what you said
[4:24:17] <Arth__> you've already been streaming for 4 hours and 24 minutes? dude did you not sleep or did you switch your sleep schedule
[4:24:24] <Arth__> ah
[4:24:31] <$floralkami> lol
[4:24:41] <jacewolf_is_the_best> he had little baby nightmares
[4:24:58] <%wibbwobbler> LUL
[4:25:00] <$floralkami> oh yeah, you were more of a loose shit than normal. it was great
[4:25:03] <@SoFarFetched> did paiges fanfics keep you awake
[4:25:05] <kikoeru_san> @floralkami okay so technicality of technicality, his name is James Woods, so he TECHNICALLY has a checkmark, he's just not THE James Woods
[4:25:05] <Thewoodentree> Pat gonna get treated like the kid that showes up to school with an arm cast.
[4:25:08] <%ShinobiPhoenix> try coke
[4:25:10] <%Daniel_Is_I> And then you Z-targeted Rare to shit on their games LUL
[4:25:22] <+OmegaWeltall> 1st Paige streams in the morning now Pat?! when's Pat and Paige in the Morning Kappa
[4:25:28] <Valask> lovely, best sleep schedule
[4:25:30] <%FacetiousAF> naps psaGib
[4:25:55] <%Axellogic> Become Eli's sleep schedule
[4:26:21] <$floralkami> @kikoeru_san ooooh, I wonder how that could make a guy like that feel, lol.
[4:26:24] <%Roasted_Pheasant> BIG SNORIN BABY
[4:26:28] <%Roasted_Pheasant> I LOVE HIM
[4:26:39] <Broken_Sonex> Plague doesn't sleep. He lays dormant.
[4:26:44] <%AnIcedCoffee> MASTERWORKS ALL
[4:26:46] <%umbypokochan> okay why are these crazy gingers getting up so early lately!
[4:26:46] <%Axellogic> Tis weak to fire
[4:26:54] <%Roasted_Pheasant> Cant go wrong
[4:26:56] <Valask> oh is that where that's from
[4:26:56] <%Axellogic> no really fire melts the swords
[4:27:00] <%SkullfaceSam> The Netflix show man....
[4:27:06] <Sunstalker> Paige did no DD stream all year FeelsBadMan
[4:27:15] <%ShinobiPhoenix> @PatStaresAt was the viewer numbers for Pillars the reason you never streamed Tyranny?
[4:27:26] <Thewoodentree> @umbypokochan They're evolving beyond sundowning to sunupping
[4:27:29] <kikoeru_san> okay time to shit and start my day proper, please sleep proper Patrick
[4:27:38] <%VoidBaronJules> plague uses fey magic or vampiric torpor for rest
[4:27:51] <Valask> Tyranny's first screen is amazing what are you on about
[4:27:57] <Valask> I fucking love it
[4:28:00] <Kurrisum> Tyranny turned out really meh anyways, you didn't miss much
[4:28:00] <+SlaterSann> I love you Pat thank you for everything
[4:28:30] <%ShinobiPhoenix> technically you were the reason I bought Tyranny because you pushed Pillars so hard, plus Obsidian
[4:28:36] <%Garthunox> Pat when you gonna stream Fallout 1?
[4:28:42] <%Xevtes> gief snoring!
[4:28:53] <Broken_Sonex> Lesson learned? Never hope for anything.
[4:28:58] <%ShinobiPhoenix> I have bought so many games because of the Best Friends Members
[4:29:23] <%Axellogic> Wish new vegas was ona better engine
[4:29:26] <%ShinobiPhoenix> like I have Into The Breach and Darkest Dungeon now because of you and Woolie
[4:29:30] <solidmsocks> new Vegas is great
[4:29:31] <%Axellogic> man it feels so jank and dated
[4:29:37] <%Daniel_Is_I> Shame Outer Worlds wasn't that great
[4:29:38] <%Picia000123> Yeah, Outer Worlds was not great the longer you went in
[4:29:42] <%Livelinne> omg that snort OhMyDog
[4:29:50] <Broken_Sonex> Obsidian is at there best when they only have one and half years of dev time
[4:29:54] <%Garthunox> holy shit fair play to that guy
[4:30:02] <+TerrorkingA> It's pretty early
[4:30:03] <PeteyMcPickle> I liked outer worlds more than new vegas by a mile
[4:30:06] <%ShinobiPhoenix> I like Outer Worlds
[4:30:06] <valriot> LUL LUL
[4:30:07] <Broken_Sonex> their*
[4:30:19] <+WizoSavage> dont forget grenades
[4:30:21] <+AShinyVagikarp> maybe try normal
[4:30:22] <marvel877> you played yourself again, Pat?
[4:30:29] <%SkullfaceSam> I played terror on gorgon and that was the most nothing a dlc has ever been
[4:30:32] <KingVantq> I'd watch halo streams
[4:30:36] <+illusiveSaint> idk if I can play halo games anymore i played too much of it as a kid
[4:30:38] <%ShinobiPhoenix> if they ever remaster New Vegas, I will probably get it, but I am kind of over Fallout
[4:30:39] <%Daniel_Is_I> If it's beam rifle jackals then Halo's sniper AI has always been nuts
[4:30:45] <Kain5707> @PatStaresAt thoughts on Project BBQ?
[4:30:57] <%TheNewJapanGuy> Divinity 2
[4:31:00] <+DJAllblue> @PatStaresAt did you finish 13 sentinels?
[4:31:01] <%Daniel_Is_I> Saw you were asking about Spyro on twitter a few days ago. Those are good games.
[4:31:10] <%AnIcedCoffee> DMC2
[4:31:11] <Jontman42> your hair has the same volume as your beard so they form a ring around your face
[4:31:12] <valriot> Banjo Kazooie Kappa
[4:31:15] <%AnIcedCoffee> Kappa
[4:31:20] <%WutangchickeN> play vectorman you coward
[4:31:21] <KaiserMario> GrimGrimoire?
[4:31:22] <%caramelatte1> Any Yakuza's you've missed?
[4:31:23] <$JojoPiero> Define Missed
[4:31:27] <%ShinobiPhoenix> if you get Spyro, it's on sale for 13 bucks on PS4 RIGHT NOW
[4:31:31] <$JojoPiero> Never played, or Never Streamed?
[4:31:38] <Kurrisum> Grim Fandango
[4:31:45] <@SoFarFetched> LUL
[4:31:50] <%Axellogic> The story is very railroady
[4:31:52] <%SkullfaceSam> Original Sin 2 or just 2?
[4:31:53] <%Daniel_Is_I> Yeah I'd highly recommend the Spyro trilogy if you've never played them
[4:31:56] <Reprobite> I loved Divinity 2 but only the first chapter or so
[4:31:57] <%Axellogic> and yeah story is weak
[4:32:10] <%TerrorkingA> TerrorkingA subscribed at Tier 1. They've subscribed for 5 months, currently on a 2 month streak! Uh, sure twitch features, I will show that I am subbed
[4:32:11] <valriot> Octopath is a weird game narratively, but i like it
[4:32:19] <%ShinobiPhoenix> I grabbed it just because it was 13 and I never played any Spyro
[4:32:21] <$JojoPiero> DoS2 puts the onus on you to make the MSQ Narrative
[4:32:23] <RamenRiderZ> Toys for Bob, give us Spyro 4 pls
[4:32:24] <%Axellogic> "dont you wanna become a god?" nah not really
[4:32:32] <%Daniel_Is_I> Octopath dropped the ball by not making the narratives connect
[4:32:35] <%ShinobiPhoenix> Octopath's problem is the hook
[4:32:42] <Wildpandaman> I beat Divinity 2 on your recommendation when you started talking about that game, and yes i got to say the main story is the weakest part, other than Fane the skelton mans story
[4:32:44] <%AnIcedCoffee> @PatStaresAt Neither of the Divinity:OS stories are very interesting, it took me a long time to get motivated to beat both of them but I ended up doing it by playing a co-op game with a friend.
[4:32:47] <Broken_Sonex> Cool gameplay and features......but the story fucking draaaags
[4:32:49] <KingVantq> Still playing DQ11 S?
[4:32:50] <%ShinobiPhoenix> because you have too many people to make any narrative of
[4:32:50] <valriot> They do, but at the end
[4:32:56] <%Daniel_Is_I> They do VERY SLIGHTLY at the end
[4:33:09] <%ShinobiPhoenix> I guess you can make too many main characters
[4:33:17] <+korean_random> the legend of heroes maybe?

[4:33:29] <%L3m0nTwi5t> Stream Secret of Mana?
[4:33:31] <%Daniel_Is_I> Octopath's ending also sucks because I used 4 characters for most of the game and the final boss forces you to use all 8 so half my team was underleveled
[4:33:45] <+NordicHorseKing> hello there
[4:33:49] <@SoFarFetched> did you beat it "legit" Kappa
[4:33:54] <%ShinobiPhoenix> like Final Fantasy VI has like 16 characters, but only so many of them get focus and the rest are side quest
[4:33:58] <%TheNewJapanGuy> I prefer DQVIII but XI is great also
[4:34:01] <$JojoPiero> Greedfall?
[4:34:01] <%WutangchickeN> how many way backs?
[4:34:03] <%AnIcedCoffee> @PatStaresAt OH. You asked about Kingdom Come: Deliverance a few months ago and I told you on Twitter about the fixes and mods that it got. Can always give it another look, it's a pretty good game now.
[4:34:04] <%thewordofhelix> @PatStaresAt you should check it out now. has a real ending
[4:34:06] <%ShinobiPhoenix> I suck at Risk of Rain 2, but I am new at it

[4:36:04] <%Daniel_Is_I> Megaman X4
[4:36:12] <%Roasted_Pheasant> You didn't BEAT Xcom 2. But you did FINISH Xcom 2.

[4:37:49] <Gameaholic42> Oh how far into Iceborne did you get? Mess with the end game content?
[4:37:49] <+Gamblor69> Play it muted?
[4:37:51] <+WizoSavage> You seen the sons of the Forest gameplay?
[4:37:52] <youngin_______420> Talk about how destiny 2 is dead

[4:38:02] <+illusiveSaint> deus ex 1 stream would be funny
[4:38:03] <Broken_Sonex> Oh yeah, forgot about that
[4:38:04] <KaiserMario> @PatStaresAt How unexcited are you for Mass Effect 4? LUL
[4:38:04] <%ArcanumArcanum> Party did you ever try Moonlighter?
[4:38:11] <RushUnplugged> wait for real?
[4:38:16] <kenny_biff> its just a mod tho
[4:38:17] <@SoFarFetched> @Gameaholic42 don't think he got far in iceborne cause he wasn't too high rank enough to get to the later stuff and didn't wanna super grind for it.
[4:38:17] <%TheNewJapanGuy> Mod?
[4:38:18] <%cowardman93> okay that sounds sick
[4:38:18] <T_Sasquatch> LUL
[4:38:18] <%Daniel_Is_I> Sort of like Skywind
[4:38:21] <%ArcanumArcanum> goddamn autocorrect
[4:38:23] <RushUnplugged> using the only thing F4 is good for, its engine?
[4:38:24] <%wibbwobbler> coool
[4:38:24] <%asgard147> That sounds rad! FeelsGoodMan
[4:38:24] <%Roasted_Pheasant> It's almost done!
[4:38:25] <T_Sasquatch> thats hilarious
[4:38:25] <%ShinobiPhoenix> Moonlighter was fun for the little bit I played of it
[4:38:34] <$ggbhtg> @patstaresat I sent one more donaysh.
[4:38:35] <Broken_Sonex> NV writing with F4 gameplay
[4:38:38] <%TheNewJapanGuy> Oh I don't care if it's just a mod tbh
[4:38:40] <%Daniel_Is_I> Moonlighter was just worse Recettear
[4:38:40] <KingVantq> oh that mod i remember hearing about that a couple months ago
[4:38:40] <AdmiralButtloaf> is it a mod?
[4:38:44] <%ConLin_Arts_> Have you heard about a game called No Straight Roads? It is a game that has a gorgeous artstyle, is a bit jank but made by a small malaysian studio, love it a lot!
[4:38:47] <T_Sasquatch> I still havent played skyrim or fallout LUL
[4:38:47] <PeteyMcPickle> The fallout 4 engine is ass though pat
[4:38:50] <$JojoPiero> Why does Bethesda tug their dicks over making Speech a % Chance
[4:38:51] <+WizoSavage> Isn't it just a remake, not necessarily bringing a lot of assets but remaking them
[4:38:55] <%aishman> Pat why are you still streaming after almost 5 hours??
[4:39:09] <%cowardman93> I swear I heard about this like 1 years ago
[4:39:13] <$ggbhtg> Sax farts
[4:39:14] <%AnIcedCoffee> LUL
[4:39:17] <+Sendrak70> Is this a mod pack?
[4:39:19] <%walternatorz> DMCA is a bitch
[4:39:23] <KingVantq> just mute the entire thing
[4:39:24] <Gameaholic42> *sigh*
[4:39:28] <%GarraOfTheFunk3 > Did you ever play the original Dawn of War?
[4:39:30] <%asgard147> I hate DMCA limesFeels FeelsBadMan
[4:39:32] <PeteyMcPickle> Jus mute it
[4:39:37] <Gameaholic42> This is Twitch now, I guess
[4:39:40] <%YakumoYomi> I thought you were joking when you said "Fallout 4 New Vegas"
[4:39:41] <KingVantq> cant have shit with this dmca stuff
[4:39:42] <T_Sasquatch> rip vod
[4:39:44] <%TerrorkingA> So who's watching Dynamite tonight to honor mr. Brodie Lee?
[4:39:46] <KaiserMario> Just put on "Clown Fatring in the basement"
[4:39:50] <%Daniel_Is_I> Here's hoping that doesn't nuke the vod
[4:39:55] <justachap> Making New Vegas into Fallout 4?
[4:39:59] <Broken_Sonex> Twitch is gonna fucking die soon i swear
[4:39:59] <%umbypokochan> Johhhnnyyyy guiiittaaaarrrr
[4:40:15] <%TheNewJapanGuy> I still prefer it to FO4's engine
[4:40:18] <%MidnightBurst12> the fuck is this?
[4:40:27] <+Sendrak70> The new vegas engine is literally the only thing keeping that game from being the best in the series in my opinion.
[4:40:29] <$valkuma> the legend of Zelda huh
[4:40:31] <KingVantq> actually crazy
[4:40:33] <Wan6Saber> fuck isz zthis?
[4:40:34] <%TheNewJapanGuy> I don't care
[4:40:41] <Broken_Sonex> Dude the F4 gameplay was a GOD SEND
[4:40:46] <Reprobite> i thought it was worse in fallout 4 honestly
[4:40:50] <$ggbhtg> I prefer this crap to this other crap
[4:40:50] <T_Sasquatch> Its impressive how people put so much effort into this shit
[4:40:53] <%cowardman93> shooting in fo4 is actually good
[4:40:55] <@SoFarFetched> Pat you should probably switch to "Chatting" for category.
[4:41:06] <%TheNewJapanGuy> Everything
[4:41:07] <GeneralHysterics> We them early morning gamers?
[4:41:09] <%wibbwobbler> this would be an improvement
[4:41:13] <GeneralHysterics> chatters, apparently?
[4:41:15] <%Axellogic> The dialogue problems werent an engine problem
[4:41:16] <justachap> Isn't it the same engine. Just ugraded?
[4:41:19] <%Roasted_Pheasant> RIP Goodsprings Settler
[4:41:24] <RamenRiderZ> It says Fallout 4 so it's got to be bas Kappa
[4:41:27] <%cowardman93> psa1guy
[4:41:29] <KaiserMario> @PatStaresAt Are you going to start a solo podcast like Bill Burr? LUL
[4:41:29] <$ggbhtg> @patstaresat I sent one more donaysh btw
[4:41:30] <RamenRiderZ> bad*
[4:41:31] <%ShinobiPhoenix> @PatStaresAt speaking of games I bought because of you, I bought Control Ultimate Edition on the recent sales
[4:41:31] <KingVantq> what is everything LUL
[4:41:32] <+WizoSavage> Oh I can see the shoulder that first person mmmmm yummy
[4:41:37] <+solidmclovin> this looks kinda tight
[4:41:39] <$JojoPiero> how shits that gun you're getting DT'd by a civ
[4:41:45] <PeteyMcPickle> So is this a mod or what?
[4:41:47] <GeneralHysterics> I'm not sure bill burr should be anyone's idle.
[4:41:53] <%umbypokochan> clean it up and jam it in
[4:41:59] <%cowardman93> mad men
[4:42:00] <%ArcanumArcanum> @thenewjapanguy oh so you don't have an actual reason
[4:42:02] <%asgard147> Snoring Fat Puppy limesAw psaDogchamp
[4:42:02] <kenny_biff> so this mod will come out never I presume?
[4:42:03] <%ConLin_Arts_> I wonder, why where F3 and NV so yellow???
[4:42:08] <KingVantq> @PeteyMcPickle New Vegas in FO4
[4:42:11] <%Roasted_Pheasant> Fallout NV is a shooter with bad gunplay
[4:42:11] <+WizoSavage> Is Gianni dipping his fingers in the VA for that game?
[4:42:11] <Broken_Sonex> @TheNewJapanGuy Define "Everything"
[4:42:12] <T_Sasquatch> as much as I love bill burr , his voice is grating
[4:42:13] <dongy14> go to sleep
[4:42:14] <dongy14> now
[4:42:18] <Arth__> are you gonna play/stream monster hunter rise?
[4:42:18] <%ShinobiPhoenix> I would not have touched Control, if not for watching Pat play it
[4:42:20] <+illusiveSaint> i never got to play fallout 4 but i did like how beefy it looked like doom
[4:42:22] <RamenRiderZ> Long Dick Johnson line remastered PogChamp
[4:42:24] <%za7az> @PatStaresAt I think a 3D remake of Earthbound in the same art style as the Link's Awakening remake would be fantastic. What do you think?
[4:42:25] <%TheNewJapanGuy> Honestly I'm just not interested in FO4 at all, and I didn't care for the changes they made twerking the mechanics overall. It's just a prefernce thing I guess
[4:42:26] <%walternatorz> so is this morning's stream a product of sleeplessness?
[4:42:29] <%aishman> @PatStaresAt Dude, haven't you been streaming for like 5 hours??
[4:42:30] <%cowardman93> have they said when that mod will appear? cause I wanna play new vegas
[4:42:31] <+MrJerples> wait is it a early stream or is it ending?
[4:42:34] <Spudnacious_Dynasty> Shame that Outer Worlds was so frontloaded in quality.
[4:42:35] <%AnIcedCoffee> Fallout 4 New Vegas looks further ahead than Skyblivion and Skywind already and it's funny.
[4:42:40] <PeteyMcPickle> Yeah but is it a mod or official @KingVantq
[4:42:44] <+dante_must_die_exe> Spawning IN the geometry LUL
[4:42:46] <+Shady_Zaku> @conlin_arts_ 3 was more green really
[4:42:49] <Gameaholic42> Lukewarm take: Fallout 4 is better as a Sims game with shooting than it is as an RPG
[4:42:54] <@SoFarFetched> Stream is near the end,but pat wants to have a little chat about video games before ending.
[4:42:55] <%Garthunox> Would you ever consider playing some of the old FF games? like 3 and 5 for example
[4:42:57] <%ConLin_Arts_> ah
[4:42:58] <KingVantq> @PeteyMcPickle mod
[4:42:59] <%thewordofhelix> @PatStaresAt you ever play any of the older DOT.HACK games? I remember watching my older brother play it and wanted to play it.
[4:43:02] <%TerrorkingA> @TheNewJapanGuy Fallout 4 is ass, but it looks better than the previous Fallouts. That's really all there is to it
[4:43:07] <solidmsocks> fo4 wasnt that bad for me
[4:43:07] <%ConLin_Arts_> but still, why the green and yellow filters???
[4:43:11] <%cowardman93> its a larger team than many games
[4:43:13] <Broken_Sonex> Also the people working on it care
[4:43:13] <PeteyMcPickle> Ah thanks
[4:43:15] <%JeanGardner99> Seeing you get back into FNV I decided to try it out and followed Gophers videos to mod, and it still broke on the first couple mods
[4:43:21] <rossnwolf> I joined right as pat said "solo podcast" ... castle super beast is okay right?
[4:43:24] <%ShinobiPhoenix> I want someone to be bold enough to stream Final Fantasy II
[4:43:48] <PeteyMcPickle> I don't think I could ever call a game good if I have to mod it into being playable
[4:43:49] <+WizoSavage> I hope Microsoft looks at this and gives them the seal of approval like Valve did with Black Mesa
[4:43:53] <KingVantq> they dont care
[4:44:01] <%TheNewJapanGuy> Oh it LOOKS better, I'm not arguing that. I don't care about how it looks it's everything else
[4:44:11] <%caramelatte1> It did for a second with that horse armor
[4:44:12] <%wibbwobbler> still waiting tho
[4:44:14] <Dutchpotato> They need the mod community
[4:44:17] <dongy14> yeah they dont give a shit
[4:44:17] <%WutangchickeN> remember when they tried to do that with skyrim?
[4:44:21] <NBD_Rab> all it takes is one dumb executive who doesn't care
[4:44:23] <%ArcanumArcanum> @rossnwolf Pat and Woolie are no longer friends (jk everything is fine)
[4:44:25] <T_Sasquatch> skyrim is only worth playing on pc
[4:44:25] <%Picia000123> Bethesda is unable to completely patch their games into a good state
[4:44:25] <%Daniel_Is_I> They TRIED to hurt their mod community a few years ago, and then backed down
[4:44:27] <%aishman> @PatStaresAt More than that, MICROSFOT hurting their modding community would be ruinous to shit like Minecraft and their Bethesda games
[4:44:28] <+thecosmicfly> Literally the reason why I haven't bought FNV and FO4 on PC yet
[4:44:33] <%Picia000123> I still really enjoy them, but man
[4:44:34] <LVL1_Scumbag> You say that, but they are still trying to kill the modding scene
[4:44:40] <T_Sasquatch> REMEMBER PAID MODS ?
[4:44:43] <PeteyMcPickle> Fallout 4 sucks dude, it just gets boring so fast
[4:44:50] <justachap> Have you played Stalker?
[4:44:51] <T_Sasquatch> Remember that shit LUL
[4:44:54] <Reprobite> Frost is good
[4:45:00] <%TheNewJapanGuy> It's sad because FO4 did have potential..
[4:45:01] <dongy14> they know they can release an unfinished game since they have the mod community. they dont give a hoot at all
[4:45:03] <%Daniel_Is_I> I hated the constant scrounging.
[4:45:07] <%ShinobiPhoenix> I was bored by Fallout 4, but mostly I was cleaning up my base
[4:45:10] <Classy_K> Fallout 4 has its moments away from the main story
[4:45:11] <RushUnplugged> the F4 DLC are actually pretty decent
[4:45:14] <%cowardman93> I like the shootbangs in 4
[4:45:15] <%aishman> @PatStaresAt Like someone said, FO4 is a fine shooter, but a TERRIBLE RPG.
[4:45:17] <RushUnplugged> just ignore the main plot
[4:45:18] <%L3m0nTwi5t> Would you be willing to stream a playthru of either Baldur's Gate 1 or 2?
[4:45:27] <%TheNewJapanGuy> Right?
[4:45:30] <Broken_Sonex> It's just the plot of Fallout 3. Only this time it Son and not Dad
[4:45:31] <dongy14> bethesda still great
[4:45:35] <+Sendrak70> That would be cool
[4:45:36] <Classy_K> also 42 fps while inside a building killed it for me
[4:45:37] <Garthunox> get rid of the settlements
[4:45:38] <%cowardman93> but shaun though
[4:45:39] <Gameaholic42> Yeah, I play 4 on PS4 and if you just get some mods that makes you get every skill at the start, it's tolerable
[4:45:43] <+DJAllblue> baldurs who?
[4:45:44] <@SoFarFetched> man that would be a good comparison to do as 3 is somewhat f resh in your mind
[4:45:45] <%wibbwobbler> there is plenty to not like in fallout 4
[4:45:45] <%za7az> That could be fun
[4:45:45] <valriot> Fuck that LUL
[4:45:46] <+illusiveSaint> did they change that much of the og fallout stats?
[4:45:46] <Arth__> are you gonna stream monter hunter rise on launch day?
[4:45:52] <%Roasted_Pheasant> Baldurs Gate PogChamp
[4:45:56] <PeteyMcPickle> Finish your ff7 playthrough you coward
[4:45:58] <goose_coward> neverwinter nights?
[4:46:06] <+Sendrak70> Its bad for stream, but good for Pat.
[4:46:07] <Broken_Sonex> HE'S VERY SCARED TO DO THAT
[4:46:07] <%bhp_99> been playing the crap out of F4 these past few weeks. trying to get achievements before modding it
[4:46:16] <%AnIcedCoffee> Even a lot of the side quests are dull. Far Harbour is when it gets decent because different writers. Bethesda just know how to nail environments and atmosphere though which is the best part of Fallout 4.
[4:46:17] <%YakumoYomi> Ah...the Child of Bhaal has awoken.
[4:46:34] <Broken_Sonex> BIG SCARY FOR PAT
[4:46:34] <%Daniel_Is_I> LUL
[4:46:35] <PeteyMcPickle> BOOBS
[4:46:36] <%walternatorz> ah yes, anime girl
[4:46:38] <+solidmclovin> nice
[4:46:39] <%Daniel_Is_I> Perfect
[4:46:39] <+Shady_Zaku> @broken_sonex Yeah, at least the dad was FUCKING LIAM NEESON THO
[4:46:41] <+WizoSavage> dont forget the sex framework if you have other ideas
[4:46:41] <%asgard147> limesLUL
[4:46:42] <+Zebylth> hell yeah
[4:46:45] <+solidmclovin> anime booba
[4:46:46] <dongy14> just turn your game into stalker and its great
[4:46:46] <Reprobite> Didn't Far Harbor steal a sidequest from a popular NV mod?
[4:46:48] <%za7az> 80085
[4:46:52] <+Sendrak70> Are we sure bethesda needs the mods...I mean...its just anime boobs.
[4:46:53] <%wibbwobbler> yes
[4:47:01] <KingVantq> Nexus mods=booba/porn mods tdogSmile
[4:47:04] <Sunstalker> eh, endorsements are flawed system. The front page mods just snowball them
[4:47:05] <%Daniel_Is_I> "More challenging"
[4:47:06] <Harro8> Booba
[4:47:18] <dongy14> git gud
[4:47:27] <neurokreplica> It's the dark souls of modding?
[4:47:27] <T_Sasquatch> Nexus mods is like 90% skyrim and fallout LUL
[4:47:35] <+WizoSavage> I honestly love Fallout 3
[4:47:35] <%caramelatte1> Hell FO4 survival mode is HORRABLE
[4:47:43] <KaiserMario> Pat, do you still consider doing some MGS, or did you let it go?
[4:47:46] <+SilverDevilfish> The 3 constants of modding: Boobs, MAKE GAME HARD, Dumb lightning shit that makes it impossible to see.
[4:47:47] <Gameaholic42> More challenging end up meaning less balanced
[4:47:52] <RushUnplugged> jsawyer without the survival is a good rebalance
[4:47:55] <%YakumoYomi> @KingVantq But the Baiken and Jack-O MHW mods are there!
[4:47:55] <newtsferatu> Jsawyer is basically the only mod I use for NV
[4:48:00] <+thecosmicfly> "Modern Realistic Graphics Mod" = desaturated and more puddles/trees
[4:48:07] <goose_coward> but you need to get the madden gamers pat
[4:48:13] <%AnIcedCoffee> And a better dialogue system.
[4:48:17] <KingVantq> @YakumoYomi tdogPiggy
[4:48:18] <%ShinobiPhoenix> honestly, i like the skill system in Cyberpunk
[4:48:19] <dongy14> tbf both the skill systems kinda suck ass
[4:48:26] <SolidusA> Stream name should be Paths Awakening :)
[4:48:27] <newtsferatu> Weird
[4:48:29] <dongy14> oblivion best skills
[4:48:34] <%Daniel_Is_I> What a strange bug
[4:48:34] <+illusiveSaint> sounds like America alright
[4:48:41] <%ShinobiPhoenix> not saying it's installed with a good game, but I had no problems with taht part
[4:48:44] <+JackalKing> Oooh, Ive had that bug with other mods before
[4:48:53] <Clundy> I remember when the Eden Creation Kit came out for FO3 and everyone was like... oh this engine really is coded like shit
[4:48:56] <%Garthunox> I HATE THE PERK SYSTEM IN 4!
[4:48:59] <%Garthunox> ITS SO BAD
[4:49:00] <%cowardman93> the settlement building in 4 causes me the biggest mind goblins going
[4:49:06] <+Sendrak70> I just want a mod for a less jank base building for FO4.
[4:49:09] <newtsferatu> After Old World Blues came out my problem was every run I did involved Logan's Loophole, so fun.
[4:49:16] <RushUnplugged> Project Nevada is horribly outdated anyway, don't use it
[4:49:17] <%AnIcedCoffee> But bullet time tho
[4:49:20] <ricoloco98> Fallout 4 still sucks
[4:49:33] <%wibbwobbler> yup lol, that transplant still looks cool
[4:49:35] <dongy14> project nevada has great stuff you dont need to use all the goofy stuff
[4:49:36] <Classy_K> why can't video game be good?
[4:49:50] <%Roasted_Pheasant> I VATSed through most encounters anyways. Why would I care about better shooting?
[4:49:52] <+KingNoodleWalrus> paaaaaaaaaat why are you awake so early
[4:49:53] <dongy14> more options is always better idk
[4:49:54] <%TheNewJapanGuy> Might as well go any FPS game if shooting is your issue
[4:50:00] <Spudnacious_Dynasty> Shooting in Nevada feels like melee in Morrowind
[4:50:05] <+thecosmicfly> @Classy_K there's never been a good video game ever
[4:50:14] <SlimeSlimeSlime> Early Pat? Oh boy!
[4:50:17] <%ShinobiPhoenix> I won't say Fallout 4 sucks, I can just say I was bored and it wasn't for me and I might be over Fallout
[4:50:33] <Classy_K> @thecosmicfly NotLikeThis
[4:50:40] <LVL1_Scumbag> That's why you use a keyboard
[4:50:50] <+JackalKing> I like the visors
[4:50:52] <Broken_Sonex> You shouldn't play Fallout for the shooting.
[4:50:54] <dongy14> You dont need to use the visor option
[4:50:58] <+illusiveSaint> have you played any of the wasteland games?
[4:51:02] <%Daniel_Is_I> BLOODY SCREEN
[4:51:02] <+Gamblor69> Like Tarkov
[4:51:09] <goose_coward> jam systems
[4:51:15] <%ShinobiPhoenix> I LOVE Call of Duty Jam (sarcasm)
[4:51:26] <T_Sasquatch> what you dont like low health destroying your screen ?
[4:51:32] <+jaayro> you dont' play it for the shooting but it is like 50% of what you will do
[4:51:39] <KaiserMario> Is that Zangief snoring?
[4:51:42] <%AnIcedCoffee> @PatStaresAt You bought the cube to solve the controller issues
[4:51:48] <T_Sasquatch> i love when games make it literally harder to see whats happening when your low health
[4:51:51] <%L3m0nTwi5t> What was more of a pain to install mods for: New Vegas or Vampire: The Masquerade?
[4:51:55] <neurokreplica> Gief big snore!
[4:52:00] <$velgaduere> @Classy_K video game invented to be bad honbunJesus
[4:52:01] <+firmlygraspi1> do you breathe like you busted a nut when you go <25% HP?
[4:52:03] <ogfruitloops> Replaying New Vegas rn on controller with Viva New Vegas probably the best way to play imo
[4:52:11] <%AnIcedCoffee> Yeah okay fucker LUL
[4:52:13] <dongy14> so you just hate it cause it doesn't work with controllers
[4:52:15] <goose_coward> the cube is a last resort
[4:52:21] <Arek_1> @PatStaresAt What mouse and keyboard would the Snapshot King recommend?
[4:52:24] <GeneralHysterics> Play starcraft with a controller you coward
[4:52:28] <KaiserMario> I thought it was Pat's stomach, but it's Gief, isn't it?
[4:52:28] <T_Sasquatch> you are crazy
[4:52:33] <+JackalKing> I seem to remember being able to use a controller for most of Project Nevada's features. That was years ago though
[4:52:36] <%Daniel_Is_I> Oh my god league/dota with a controller would be awful
[4:52:36] <dongy14> thats fair
[4:52:36] <%cowardman93> I miss the cube
[4:52:41] <theanora1> League does have a controller option, it's Smite
[4:52:43] <kenny_biff> chat is real judgmental tonight
[4:52:45] <Classy_K> league is going to have controller support in the future when it releases on console
[4:52:45] <T_Sasquatch> playing league with a controller sounds liike actual hell
[4:52:50] <newtsferatu> Didn't realize Project Nevada was a hill people were willing to die on
[4:52:51] <valriot> How do you call woolie crazy playing a game in a worse way?
[4:52:53] <+ryderbootz> Real Yakuza use a gamepad
[4:53:04] <Broken_Sonex> @PatStaresAt Turning Fallout into an FPS was a massive mistake
[4:53:14] <SaltyAzteca> CoD syndrome
[4:53:17] <KaiserMario> Not balanced for fean
[4:53:19] <$ggbhtg> video games ALWAYS need more realism
[4:53:21] <KaiserMario> "lean
[4:53:22] <$ggbhtg> I guess
[4:53:23] <%Daniel_Is_I> I vastly prefer mods that just make you broken OP. Some of the Skyrim perk overhaul systems do that and it's fun as hell.
[4:53:24] <+SilverDevilfish> I have to make it so you have to eat food and drink water because of a fad in gaming when I made this mod Kappa
[4:53:25] <+Sendrak70> Meh, its a personal choice. I can see the merit to the changes with Navada. But it looks like the biggest ones just dont work with your play style.
[4:53:26] <ogfruitloops> Project Nevadas garbage
[4:53:28] <dongy14> yeah rpg shooting fucks you when you get killed instantly
[4:53:34] <%caramelatte1> FO4 survival was bullshit, just constantly getting sniped from a mile away.
[4:53:35] <%bhp_99> With NV I just put some basic mods like more weapons and quests and have enjoyed it.
[4:53:35] <%WutangchickeN> are there any mods that turn the fallout combat into something turn based?
[4:53:35] <T_Sasquatch> I look forward to league on consoles tho
[4:53:39] <%Axellogic> Is Project Nevada why fallout 4 is so shooting focused
[4:53:41] <T_Sasquatch> the mobile league isnt too bad
[4:53:41] <%aishman> Like shit.
[4:53:48] <%Roasted_Pheasant> It looks like Diablo 2
[4:53:48] <justachap> The Misery mod for Stalker: Call of Pripyat
[4:53:52] <+Lionrebellion> so you don't like S.T.A.L.K.E.R.
[4:53:53] <%bhp_99> isometric
[4:53:54] <%ShinobiPhoenix> 1 is ass, 2 is better ass
[4:53:56] <%TheNewJapanGuy> Dude what do you think
[4:53:57] <kenny_biff> I like the classic FO1 and 2 look
[4:53:59] <%Valdorick> Like a game from the 90s
[4:54:05] <Broken_Sonex> It looks okay, honestly.
[4:54:07] <%chubbypencil> I can't remember, is LoL:Wild Rift getting controller support or no?
[4:54:18] <Broken_Sonex> For a game from 97
[4:54:21] <giogio346> is fallout 4 a better rpg than cyberpunk?
[4:54:24] <%ShinobiPhoenix> I mean it looked good for BACK IN THE DAY
[4:54:27] <%Roasted_Pheasant> Wild Rift is phone only
[4:54:28] <KaiserMario> LUL He's so loud I luv him psaDogchamp
[4:54:33] <%aishman> YEYEYE
[4:54:37] <+illusiveSaint> i wish they made remaster of fallout 1/2 i enjoyed playing them but it was clunky
[4:54:38] <%Garthunox> plat fft
[4:54:41] <dongy14> @giogio346 not
[4:54:42] <+dante_must_die_exe> yeye
[4:54:45] <+WizoSavage> I mean, why make the gunplay mediocre when you can improve it
[4:54:46] <%Valdorick> A 90s game, from the 90s.
[4:54:46] <%Garthunox> play*
[4:54:46] <%aishman> Wait are you trying FO1 on STEAM?
[4:54:49] <GeneralHysterics> oh shit, you're just gonna do it live? That's bold as hell
[4:54:56] <Broken_Sonex> 97, dude
[4:54:58] <+firmlygraspi1> WHAT IS THIS SHIT PATRICK?
[4:55:00] <%aishman> No dude, if you want it to run at all, you have to go through GoG @PatStaresAt
[4:55:02] <Torgue_1> Wha happen?
[4:55:07] <+cameronfincher> Your FNV 2nd run through is my ultimate comfort play through
[4:55:08] <%Picia000123> Do not try it on Steam man
[4:55:08] <kenny_biff> I'd try FO1 or 2 from GOG if its availabel
[4:55:09] <%GarraOfTheFunk3 > I feel like I kept bouncing off of fallout BECAUSE it didn't feel good as a shooter
[4:55:11] <KaiserMario> Turn on 256 colors Pat
[4:55:12] <jimmytwofeet> WHATS THIS
[4:55:13] <%ShinobiPhoenix> I am of the opinion that black sheep games should be remade
[4:55:14] <$ggbhtg> big ol incompatibo
[4:55:21] <jimmytwofeet> THE FUCCBOIVIN
[4:55:21] <+firmlygraspi1> always did *BANG*
[4:55:24] <%ShinobiPhoenix> to redeem them
[4:55:26] <+thecosmicfly> @illusiveSaint Wish granted *Hands over Fallout 1/2: Reforged*
[4:55:26] <justachap> PC be like "What is this ancient fossil?!"
[4:55:30] <%aishman> @PatStaresAt If you want to play old games that run well that DO NOT have Enhanced edition. You have to go through GoG
[4:55:30] <%Picia000123> Any old game play on GOG or suffer
