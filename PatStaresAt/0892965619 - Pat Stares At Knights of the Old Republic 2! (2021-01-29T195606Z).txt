[0:10:37] <GarbageQueenEllie> you shouldn't abuse animals, dammit!
[0:10:39] <%CatastropheCorvid> I've trained dogs, Best thing you can do for ensuring they follow commands is under no circumstances give them what they want until they do what you want. Every time. Dog wants food? Do a high five. No high five? No food. It can be rough at the beginning, and requires a looot of time because you also don't want them to starve, of course.
[0:10:42] <%Alazull> Yet
[0:10:49] <i_need_sciss0rz> seems like a lot of people share that sentiment about the medium

[0:39:08] <+gitgouda> cant use your crit? thats a bummer
[0:39:11] <penitentpendant> Since the final stages lets you use powers. Which is just 'cool.' 'Lightning!'
[0:39:13] <%SharkMissile> Real talk why is his hit rate so low?
[0:39:16] <%AzureGale> btw I think you have the wrong overlay up :x
[0:39:17] <%Ragnvaldr_AGH> @PatStaresAt not using the kotor layout today?
[0:39:25] <%SharkMissile> His gear and stats seem fine
[0:39:33] <%Ragnvaldr_AGH> :D
[0:39:36] <Grimlock_Master> if you're already missing, flurrry will be a better option
[0:39:36] <Goodvibes99508> can't wait to see gamer the gator doing 720s as evo coming this summer. laser gator the annialtor

[0:40:00] <%Daxalog> Oh
[0:40:02] <notsoy> the jal shey robes can get underlays, if you needed HP regen

[0:40:31] <%Movemeister> This layout we see the health, other layout we see the subs

[0:40:42] <GarbageQueenEllie> Swing better, you bitch!
[0:40:48] <%Mrbaconator> the mandalorians want to speak to kah rens manager
[0:40:55] <Goodvibes99508> someone tell him flurry lowers his defense
[0:40:56] <notsoy> caster builds suck in a game that has 100 fistfight sidequests
[0:40:56] <paddygrilldaddy> Ew a fighting "game"
[0:40:59] <dan_g_v> hey chat peoples, why are we killing younglings this early in the day?
[0:41:02] <%gitgouda> yeeeeah thats what i though critical is great
[0:41:05] <%Too_Much_Nukie> @PatStaresAt basic flurry is pretty much a debuff.
[0:41:08] <dan_g_v> or has Pat been playing since last night?
[0:41:09] <ZComiX> this is the way
[0:41:14] <%Too_Much_Nukie> Because of the accuracy debuff and defense debuff
[0:41:17] <Mattais88> Better fight animation than Ex-Arm right here
[0:41:20] <%AzureGale> Is there a game in which crit builds AREN'T the best
[0:41:20] <%toolofparanoia> This is the way
[0:41:20] <GarbageQueenEllie> Using special moves are like High Rollin'
[0:41:21] <ravioli_ronin> This is the way
[0:41:30] <%gitgouda> this is the way

[0:42:56] <dan_g_v> quick, use Mines
[0:42:57] <+vehementvadr> its thematically fiting that kae ran can't win an actual fist fight
[0:42:57] <%augusta_wind> consider: hitting him
[0:42:58] <%logoth_> Why is she wearing a track suit
[0:42:59] <ZComiX> can you not forcwe buff before the fight?

[0:48:40] <%Too_Much_Nukie> Oh Kelborn.

[0:51:44] <%Undenizen> so there is an argument now for athletic runners who want to amputate their legs because prosthetics are so good now they surpass the speed to muscle weight ratio.
[0:51:59] <%damienlunas> @PatStaresAt You can absolutely push your opponent out of the battle circle. Look up KotOR2 - easy way to beat battlecircles on youtube.

[0:53:15] <%Undenizen> @Gruhunchously It's not really politics if one person's platform is "BUT WHAT IF EVIL?"

[0:53:39] <%JohnAtDawn> Man the writers really doged a bullet with the name Iziz

[0:55:45] <%Undenizen> Kay'ren would demand someone give her the best lightsaber as compensation because they spilled her coffee.
[0:55:48] <GarbageQueenEllie> This is the TRUE Karen way.
[0:55:56] <Admiral_PopnFresh> It's crazy that after the Exar Kun war, and the Mandalorians got whalloped, they came back to where it all began and was like "Yo dog, what if we did that...AGAIN!?!"

[0:57:28] <Gruhunchously> I like how you STILL almost lost
[0:57:34] <subjectg> level up
[0:57:47] <%Too_Much_Nukie> Bralor's fight has no restrictions btw
[0:57:49] <Gruhunchously> @damienlunas He leveled up in the middle of the fight, which restores your health to full.
[0:57:50] <%gitgouda> whats the max level in kotor 2?
[0:58:05] <%Too_Much_Nukie> I recommend using plague on Bralor right at the start.
[0:58:09] <AntifaCatboy> 50
[0:58:09] <Gruhunchously> 50, I think
[0:58:11] <subjectg> level 50, which is impossible without exploits
[0:58:20] <GarbageQueenEllie> It's always so satisfying to go HAM at the end
[0:58:24] <Admiral_PopnFresh> bless Peach
[0:58:26] <%augusta_wind> bless you paige
[0:58:32] <%Too_Much_Nukie> Most people end KOTOR 2 around level 30.
[0:58:41] <Mattais88> Go Go Gadget Force Lightning
[0:58:46] <%Too_Much_Nukie> But everything in the game levels with you so being level 50 can be fun.
[0:58:46] <subjectg> i do wonder what level 50 would look like in 3.5
[0:58:51] <%Undenizen> Kinda weird how this honorable warrior race feels the need to stack the deck in their favor.
[0:59:03] <%Too_Much_Nukie> @subjectg A fucking god king
[0:59:03] <%AzureGale> Get up his arsenal

[0:59:27] <subjectg> i don‚Äôt know if they fixed it in the mod, but don‚Äôt enemies in this game stop scaling at around lvl 22 or so?
[0:59:29] <%AzureGale> No plague, except the plague of gripes
[0:59:41] <%Too_Much_Nukie> Bralor is the biggest badass in the camp Pat.

[1:00:18] <%Too_Much_Nukie> Why would a Mandalorian war veteran NOT be immune to fear?
[1:00:20] <subjectg> ‚ÄúBralor is too powerful for Fear‚Äù
[1:00:20] <alroy900> patyou have to hit him
[1:00:26] <%AzureGale> Insanity is doing the same thing over and over and expecting different results
[1:00:26] <%damienlunas> If he's immune it would say immune.
[1:00:28] <Gruhunchously> Really making the Jedi look good here

[1:01:21] <penitentpendant> The Buffest Robot
[1:01:25] <Broken_Sonex> Just remember you're nothing without your shit.
[1:01:34] <%alyss988> dellyHi
[1:01:38] <%Undenizen> It's like if a martial arts master challenged someone with a gun.
[1:01:40] <penitentpendant> Even HK would get jelly of them gains
[1:01:53] <GarbageQueenEllie> Why do the Mando armors look so yummy? I just love the aesthetic
[1:01:55] <+vaderxyz1970> How does being a Jedi help in ship to ship combat?
[1:02:09] <+Delenay> i just got 360 mbps internet. from 40... wooo go fast
[1:02:12] <%Too_Much_Nukie> All of the people you fought have stuff to say.
[1:02:14] <Broken_Sonex> @vaderxyz1970 ......The Force?
[1:02:15] <subjectg> they‚Äôre basically elites in their colors
[1:02:20] <%Zetheos> force pull

[1:02:22] <%BallerSwagBro9k> @vaderxyz1970 Battle Meditation
[1:02:23] <%Undenizen> @vaderxyz1970 well, they turn off their nav computers.
[1:02:33] <Gruhunchously> @vaderxyz1970 Superior reflexes or somthing
[1:02:36] <penitentpendant> I wasn't paying attention, did he ever fight Kex, the vendor?
[1:02:37] <KeiPrime> newtype powers
[1:02:38] <subjectg> look they have minors, majors, zealots, and an arbitrr
[1:03:00] <+vaderxyz1970> I'm thinking Stars Destroy we Vs Star Destoyer
[1:03:00] <GarbageQueenEllie> dude, if anything, the mandos have a MASSIVE hard-on for warrior jedi
[1:03:06] <%Manjove> @vaderxyz1970 their ability to predicted the immediate future.
[1:03:14] <+Dova573> they are like we gotta learn the match up gg
[1:03:14] <fuji_92> mandolorians are the good part of the fgc
[1:03:23] <%Hasmeister96> So then why is Mando allowed to hate droids?
[1:03:30] <%BallerSwagBro9k> @fuji_92 LUL
[1:03:40] <Admiral_PopnFresh> its pretty fun
[1:03:47] <+nirvana227> LUL

[1:03:53] <%AzureGale> Pat wants Kreia to step on him
[1:03:55] <penitentpendant> A shame she "Aeriths" later on in the story
[1:03:56] <%ssjklyco> Krea is also blind
[1:04:01] <%Too_Much_Nukie> You can do a "Good Student" run though, I've done it before.
[1:04:02] <%shurtal> .....Slossiphees?
[1:04:05] <BoneBagMel> I could HEAR that stare

[1:04:10] <+Gamblor69> Nice lol
[1:04:12] <GarbageQueenEllie> I like having a powerful woman tell me I'm stupid. It's hot.
[1:04:14] <%Zetheos> did Paige show you her philosophies
[1:04:17] <%BallerSwagBro9k> BOOB GOOD Thats my philosophy
[1:04:25] <Gruhunchously> @GarbageQueenEllie Imagine Bao-Dur trying to deal with his PTSD while Mandalorian ladies everywhere are thirsting after him for his big war crimes.
[1:04:26] <%BallerSwagBro9k> AND SHES OLD TOO :)
[1:04:29] <@PlagueOfGripes> Kreia is old, blind, racist and horny for war
[1:04:30] <%Hasmeister96> @BallerSwagBro9k Fair enough
[1:04:34] <penitentpendant> Speaking of granny
[1:04:42] <Gruhunchously> Oh, here's Kreia dong what she does.

[1:05:19] <%BallerSwagBro9k> GODDAMN IT PAIGE STI;;? LUL
[1:05:20] <penitentpendant> It's funny, considering how many cutscenes she has without you around, she's basically a Deuteragonist
[1:05:20] <fuji_92> never pat, paige will never let you
[1:05:20] <+MidnightBurst12> that's how it be sometimes
[1:05:27] <%Too_Much_Nukie> @PatStaresAt Just do a group watch for Mandalorian. That'll make Paige watch it.
[1:05:29] <%Ragnvaldr_AGH> I think this is restored content
[1:05:32] <GarbageQueenEllie> God, she is SO passive-aggressive, UNGH
[1:05:33] <@PlagueOfGripes> WE WERE COOL OK
[1:05:37] <%CatastropheCorvid> "Clan Ordo"
[1:05:38] <+Dova573> man dont it suck when you gotta wait for the girl you like to want to wathc the new show you are excited for
[1:05:38] <%barrakuta371> Paige just let watch Mandalorian. You can watch it later
[1:05:47] <%Movemeister> LUL
[1:06:00] <%Too_Much_Nukie> I mean, she's right.
[1:06:03] <%TheMattman1313> Clan-dalorian
[1:06:04] <%Undenizen> @GarbageQueenEllie She's really more agressive agressive. she's just softly spoken
[1:06:06] <+nirvana227> damn LUL
[1:06:11] <%Too_Much_Nukie> The Mandalorians that survive are not what Canderous wants them to be.
[1:06:15] <nivlac_555> oooooo

[1:06:16] <Broken_Sonex> JANGOOOOO
[1:06:17] <Mattais88> Just Like you kreia
[1:06:17] <fuji_92> kreia spitting truths

[1:06:22] <penitentpendant> Kreia: Angrier, Older More Focused Paige
[1:06:22] <%BallerSwagBro9k> @Too_Much_Nukie Yup straight up
[1:06:29] <subjectg> ‚ÄúAnd all that remains will be a spin-off on Disney+‚Äù
[1:06:45] <Broken_Sonex> Keria is smart Paige
[1:07:09] <Admiral_PopnFresh> Protecc Karen
[1:07:17] <Broken_Sonex> That's why the world nerffed her
[1:07:22] <%gitgouda> i love how kreia just mentally breaks your companions so they are loyal to you
[1:07:29] <GarbageQueenEllie> (Dying) HONOOOOORRRRR
[1:07:30] <Thesomeone96> woah good dog
[1:07:33] <+vaderxyz1970> Candorus is the smartest character in this game with that sentence alone
[1:07:34] <%Zetheos> bitch just tore this dude a new one and still wants him to help her
[1:07:39] <%Too_Much_Nukie> In Legends canon, the Mandalorians got to be cool after this. In current canon, they died like bitches and never returned to glory. Becoming a peaceful people.
[1:07:43] <%linSP> kreia destroyed him with facts and logic
[1:07:49] <+nirvana227> jmoWut
[1:07:50] <Gruhunchously> Smartest thing anyone has said yet
[1:07:53] <%BallerSwagBro9k> LUL
[1:07:59] <fuji_92> FIGHT!
[1:08:09] <subjectg> hourly reminder that the sith are in this game
[1:08:18] <%Undenizen> I like how casually she announces a life-threatening emergency
[1:08:22] <%anticrust> DARK CARTH
[1:08:23] <Gruhunchously> HK in the back lie' what eliminate them'all? YES PLEASE?'
[1:08:24] <%barrakuta371> "allies" she says
[1:08:27] <Broken_Sonex> I love how they he totally knew he was there
[1:08:36] <+vaderxyz1970> The "Sith"
[1:08:37] <%Mr_Pylon> Does anyone ever just say "Don't care" and walk away from Kreia when she's negging?
[1:08:39] <%Zetheos> HK + T3 best boys
[1:08:50] <Gruhunchously> @Undenizen For a game called The Sith Lords, they don't show up very often.
[1:08:53] <Goodvibes99508> be sure to take T3 to the planet so you have a mobile workbench
[1:09:02] <%Undenizen> @Mr_Pylon Pat did it a few times but it just skips a ton of dialogue
[1:09:13] <%Too_Much_Nukie> lol
[1:09:14] <%Zetheos> I love you T3
[1:09:17] <Broken_Sonex> @Mr_Pylon No, because then the plot would cease to happen
[1:09:22] <Gruhunchously> huh, that was weird
[1:09:23] <%Too_Much_Nukie> @PatStaresAt Once a certain number of them die you move on.
[1:09:23] <AntifaCatboy> Are you gonna drop Visas for Hanharr later?
[1:09:29] <%Too_Much_Nukie> You reached the kill count like instantly.
[1:09:30] <subjectg> @gruhunchously mandated subtitles man
[1:09:30] <fuji_92> damn, T3 a good boy
[1:09:46] <%Ragnvaldr_AGH> F O R C E S T O R M
[1:09:46] <+vaderxyz1970> @mr_pylon She'd prob just kill you out of spite for not listening to her facts and logic
[1:09:50] <%Too_Much_Nukie> You can go back and grab their corpse loot later on.
[1:10:00] <@PlagueOfGripes> swathed in holy light
[1:10:02] <%anticrust> cause mando
[1:10:03] <%CatastropheCorvid> Cando
[1:10:03] <%Too_Much_Nukie> Yeah the other has to be Mandalore.
[1:10:03] <scrublordsamurai> how can karen hope to out karen the karen kween kreia?
[1:10:03] <%Ragnvaldr_AGH> gotta take mandalore

[1:10:16] <%Mr_Pylon> Thanks all, lol
[1:10:20] <Gruhunchously> @vaderxyz1970 Hey, guess what happens in the darkside version of the Enclave scene?
[1:10:24] <%Too_Much_Nukie> @PatStaresAt Visas has a good amount of unique dialogue here.
[1:10:24] <fuji_92> t3 is a workbench
[1:10:29] <%Zetheos> he's cute
[1:10:31] <%Too_Much_Nukie> T3 doesn't have to come.
[1:10:35] <%BallerSwagBro9k> Robts cant cum
[1:10:37] <%king_wragles> This robot was programmed to have ethics... and feel pain
[1:10:39] <subjectg> you can switch out your party member on onderon
[1:10:40] <Gruhunchously> Bring Visas
[1:10:41] <%Ragnvaldr_AGH> doesn't have to come
[1:10:42] <%slimmixrp> You can switch them out
[1:10:45] <+strakillias> Hes a workbench but there is a workbench in the docotr office anyway
[1:10:46] <AntifaCatboy> HK
[1:10:46] <%anticrust> HK is waifu
[1:10:48] <Goodvibes99508> the planet stifes you there is a ton of stuff and one workbench is saves so much time
[1:10:54] <subjectg> don‚Äôt think about how you fit everyone onto the shuttle
[1:10:56] <Broken_Sonex> Why should Pat care, then prosed to NOT care chat?
[1:10:57] <GarbageQueenEllie> Dip your nuggets in that V-Sauce
[1:11:01] <%slimmixrp> @PatStaresAt I think you can switch them out when you get planetside
[1:11:01] <fuji_92> ywah go full commando with mando and hk PogChamp
[1:11:04] <+Undenizen> @Gruhunchously I forgot what happened in the first one. but I'm gonna bet it involves being stupid evil for no reason
[1:11:15] <Virokwet> bork borker
[1:11:21] <%Too_Much_Nukie> @Goodvibes99508 Or you could just not use the workbench while there.
[1:11:29] <GustauveVIII> I'm just sad that Onderon is just 3 areas and a cantina.
[1:11:38] <Gruhunchously> It's funny, Mandalore and Visas get some oddly shippy moments towards the end.
[1:11:46] <%Undenizen> no fair. we want to see crying pupper
[1:12:01] <%Undenizen> yeah it's kinda their thing.
[1:12:01] <Goodvibes99508> @too_much_nukie you have to gear up canderous tho
[1:12:04] <qu3kl41n_the_impure_king> use wipes and get away with it anyway
[1:12:07] <GarbageQueenEllie> It's like a motif now to use cheap ass effects
[1:12:12] <AEnemyStandUser> well the star wipes are from like older cereals
[1:12:12] <%Manjove> yeah, Wipes are great
[1:12:19] <%BallerSwagBro9k> Time for the worst planet
[1:12:20] <Mattais88> Ang Lee's Hulk was 90% wipes
[1:12:31] <%augusta_wind> i'm watching all the star wars movies for the first time with my partner and i wish i could say i liked them
[1:12:33] <subjectg> it feels weird seeing the wipes in other media now
[1:12:38] <%Undenizen> Wipes are terrible guys.
[1:12:42] <%SirGO0SE> Chad Jedi
[1:12:44] <%BallerSwagBro9k> @Mattais88 Oh yeah...that happened
[1:12:44] <winner_92> its because star wars is poop they have to wipe after they poop please laugh
[1:12:46] <GarbageQueenEllie> India Planet???
[1:12:49] <%Zetheos> the hell is her accent
[1:12:52] <%Too_Much_Nukie> @Goodvibes99508 No you don't lol
[1:12:59] <BerryliciousDefinition> Wipes are so cheesy I love it
[1:13:02] <%Too_Much_Nukie> Onderonian.
[1:13:05] <%anticrust> wow her VA
[1:13:08] <GarbageQueenEllie> @winner_92 I laughed a bit. I am ashamed
[1:13:10] <%Undenizen> @Zetheos offensive indian
[1:13:10] <%BallerSwagBro9k> That accent HAS NOT aged well
[1:13:11] <+vaderxyz1970> Mmmmm Space Curry
[1:13:12] <OldManDeckardCain> I don't think that's her accent, it's just bad voice acting LUL
[1:13:15] <%Too_Much_Nukie> Kavar is the coolest of the Jedi masters, by far.
[1:13:20] <%Manjove> i still prefer wipes to smash cuts.
[1:13:23] <Gruhunchously> @GarbageQueenEllie Kind of like...Easter Roman Empire Planet.
[1:13:31] <winner_92> @GarbageQueenEllie thank you for validating my stupidity
[1:13:38] <%BallerSwagBro9k> @vaderxyz1970 bro plz LUL
[1:13:38] <Broken_Sonex> @BallerSwagBro9k PRAISE AL-
[1:13:45] <%toolofparanoia> Karen's aggro knows no bounds
[1:13:48] <GarbageQueenEllie> @Gruhunchously oooo! A Byzantian Planet?
[1:14:01] <%Too_Much_Nukie> He can't take it off Pat.
[1:14:06] <%anticrust> It is the Way though
[1:14:07] <subjectg> Ia! Ia! Dagon Ghent!
[1:14:07] <%toolofparanoia> why?
[1:14:08] <Admiral_PopnFresh> This is the way
[1:14:10] <Goodvibes99508> this is the way
[1:14:13] <%Too_Much_Nukie> @PatStaresAt Whoever wears the armor is Mandalore.
[1:14:13] <OldManDeckardCain> shh, there was no time
[1:14:16] <%SirGO0SE> this is the way
[1:14:23] <%toolofparanoia> This is the way
[1:14:26] <%Too_Much_Nukie> It's not the way shut the fuck up
[1:14:30] <Broken_Sonex> @vaderxyz1970 Delicious, delicious, Space Curry
[1:14:30] <ravioli_ronin> Is canderous one of those weird watch assholes that won‚Äôt take it off?
[1:14:32] <GustauveVIII> why not equip your armband for the passive bonus?
[1:14:33] <StarkAvKnark> this is the way
[1:14:35] <%patriotrenegade> stop with the Ugandan Knuckles references, guys.
[1:14:41] <%anticrust> @Too_Much_Nukie This is the Way
[1:14:41] <%Too_Much_Nukie> That's not how Mandalorians work, they can take their helmets off whenever they want.
[1:14:49] <+cvp5127> the armor stays on
[1:14:50] <%toolofparanoia> the way of the Mandalore
[1:14:50] <%SirGO0SE> its not ugandan knuckles you fools
[1:14:53] <+MidnightBurst12> he's welded in, probably
[1:14:53] <%BallerSwagBro9k> THIS IS THE WAE
[1:14:54] <Admiral_PopnFresh> @PatStaresAt Kappa
[1:14:55] <Fapbsi> maybe he has a mustache under his helmet and doesn't want to show it
[1:14:57] <%SirGO0SE> its from mandalorian lol
[1:15:00] <frostyjay3> Ugandan Knuckles????
[1:15:02] <subjectg> he‚Äôs just got that master chief mentality
[1:15:02] <%slimmixrp> Why does he always start with gun but is spec'd for melee
[1:15:05] <Broken_Sonex> blaa blaa blaa, This is the way, blaa blaa blaa
[1:15:05] <Goodvibes99508> can you switch party here?
[1:15:06] <%Too_Much_Nukie> Mandalorians fuck, Dinn is a dumbass.
[1:15:08] <+vaderxyz1970> Its got all those exotic galatic spices
[1:15:09] <frostyjay3> Do you know da way????
[1:15:13] <GarbageQueenEllie> @MidnightBurst12 That sounds scary as hell
[1:15:14] <KeiPrime> ugandan knuckles what is this 2018
[1:15:15] <StarkAvKnark> Ugandan mandalore?
[1:15:23] <subjectg> He‚Äôs got more strength, he buff
[1:15:30] <%Ragnvaldr_AGH> Mandalore is 100% better as a melee fighter
[1:15:30] <%Undenizen> make him a sneak specialist.
[1:15:33] <$narkonis> hasL keep up the good stream vibes pat! EXCITED FOR GENE ON MONDAY
[1:15:35] <%Ragnvaldr_AGH> look at his stats
[1:15:39] <penitentpendant> Dex is ranged, STR is melee, it's weird
[1:15:40] <subjectg> also since you can‚Äôt take off his armor he will never get DEX bonuses
[1:15:44] <GustauveVIII> you can check his stats in his feats page
[1:15:46] <GarbageQueenEllie> He can be whatever you want him to be, Kaeryn
[1:15:47] <%toolofparanoia> Din is a brainwashed cultist
[1:15:49] <Broken_Sonex> Do the Woolie thing and ignore that he's a melee boy
[1:15:49] <%Too_Much_Nukie> @PatStaresAt Mandalore works best with repeating blasters.
[1:15:49] <%patriotrenegade> What if Mandalorians are just advanced Tuskens
[1:15:50] <%anticrust> lightsaber
[1:15:52] <%Ragnvaldr_AGH> big swords
[1:15:53] <AntifaCatboy> dual wield swords
[1:15:55] <%Too_Much_Nukie> Alternatively big dumb axes.
[1:15:56] <%Ragnvaldr_AGH> for big boys
[1:16:05] <subjectg> @patstaresat two swords, so you can pretend he‚Äôs solidus
[1:16:19] <GarbageQueenEllie> You could just do Bolth
[1:16:22] <Admiral_PopnFresh> @Too_Much_Nukie you don't take off your helmet if you happen to be in a religious cult
[1:16:23] <Gruhunchously> @BallerSwagBro9k The actress is actually of Indian descent though. i don't know if that's here real accent or not.
[1:16:27] <%slimmixrp> You'll get hella feats
[1:16:28] <%anticrust> He doesnt' have the most optimal build
[1:16:29] <%Undenizen> I mean, Karen likes her swords, so I'd recommend doing NOT swords.
[1:16:30] <+OG_M_Bison> Did Pat get a haircut PogChamp
[1:16:43] <subjectg> Soldiers get shittons of feats don‚Äôt worry about it
[1:16:43] <%slimmixrp> He starts off built like shit but you get hella feats
[1:16:44] <RetributionP> he is ment to Jack of all trades combat
[1:16:46] <%BallerSwagBro9k> @PatStaresAt BTW did u beat Wasteland 3? What you think?
[1:16:52] <%Undenizen> @OG_M_Bison he became egg last week
[1:16:53] <%patriotrenegade> Think about it, both the Mandalorians and Tuskens are tribe/clan based, they have a taboo on showing skin, and the Armorer‚Äôs helmet looks like the spikes coming out of a Tusken‚Äôs head-wrapping
[1:16:56] <%SirGO0SE> and my axe
[1:17:03] <%Too_Much_Nukie> @Admiral_PopnFresh It's the dumbest shit. I like Mandalorian well enough but they've compounded the damage Clone Wars did to Mandalorian culture and history in a way that really sucks.
[1:17:04] <%anticrust> AXE! AXE AXE AXE AXE AXE!
[1:17:07] <Drakenstorm13> It's a list not even a system
[1:17:23] <%Manjove> this is honestly one of the reasons i dont like what the TV show did to Mandalorians, the normies just quote "This is the way." for literally anything that has to do with Mando's even if it doesnt fit.
[1:17:30] <%Too_Much_Nukie> @patriotrenegade They don't have a taboo on showing skin. That's one specific dumbass sect.
[1:17:36] <+OG_M_Bison> @OG_M_Bison Missed the transition into 47 FeelsBadMan
[1:17:41] <%Too_Much_Nukie> Which doesn't exist at this point in the galaxy.
[1:17:44] <%slimmixrp> Thats what I said lel
[1:17:54] <%patriotrenegade> @too_much_nukie I‚Äôve connected the dots
[1:17:56] <%SirGO0SE> i wonder if being a workbench is T3's fetish
[1:17:57] <%slimmixrp> Goff ass Kotor 2
[1:18:18] <subjectg> Upgrade stuff on me daddy????
[1:18:35] <+retro_godfather> you know you can just keep him with a blaster and boost his dex on lvl up and it will be fine, can build mando either way
[1:18:44] <%Too_Much_Nukie> Mandalorian doesn't even have a single character speaking Mando'a
[1:18:45] <GustauveVIII> @PatStaresAt Since you'll be having energy resistance, blaster deflection doesn't really mean all that much.
[1:18:48] <%slimmixrp> She has it equipped
[1:18:52] <%Too_Much_Nukie> Which is honestly baffling.
[1:18:52] <Nirvrat> hey Pat. I wanted to ask a question and I don't bother with Twitter. Just out of curiosity are you aware of Escape from Tarkov and if so your opinion? It seems like item tetris and grinding would be right up your alley.
[1:18:54] <Gruhunchously> @SirGO0SE I don't know about that, but Trask from KOTOR 1 definitely has something going on. 'You can use me to unlock the door!'
[1:19:03] <%patriotrenegade> @patstaresat I think the most random and esoteric Star Wars fact I can give you is that the monster that grabbed Luke in the trash compactor in Episode IV was actually trying to baptize him. Also it‚Äôs a girl, her name is Omi, she‚Äôs Force-sensitive and a lesbian.
[1:19:10] <Admiral_PopnFresh> @Too_Much_Nukie canon reset, bro
[1:19:18] <Broken_Sonex> @SirGO0SE Yeah, that's right, create your Death Machine on me~!
[1:19:22] <GarbageQueenEllie> Massive Crits for Massive Pricks
[1:19:28] <%Too_Much_Nukie> @Admiral_PopnFresh Mando'a still exists in canon!
[1:19:53] <Goodvibes99508> @patriotrenegade you made that up
[1:19:56] <Gruhunchously> The animations in the game glitch out frequently.
[1:20:00] <%Too_Much_Nukie> Mando'a still exists in the current canon universe, yet these traditionalists don't speak it? Bo Katan never learned it?
[1:20:02] <GarbageQueenEllie> @patriotrenegade Plz tell me that's a joke.
[1:20:06] <%patriotrenegade> I did not look it up
[1:20:08] <BallerSwagBro9k> @patriotrenegade I would you made that up....but that sounds way too out there....
[1:20:09] <subjectg> ‚ÄúYou and me exile, we can destroy the Patriots!‚Äù
[1:20:39] <Gruhunchously> "THE SON'S OF LIBERTY"
[1:20:42] <Broken_Sonex> @patriotrenegade Prof or it didn't happen
[1:20:47] <+retro_godfather> toughness dex hp regen is solid on him
[1:20:58] <%BallerSwagBro9k> @GarbageNirvana I just wikid it....its super real....
[1:21:00] <subjectg> EXON OF HISTORY
[1:21:06] <alroy900> @patriotrenegade oh god, you're not lying
[1:21:21] <%Too_Much_Nukie> Omi is super real.
[1:21:23] <Jetsfantasy> He's not lying guys...
[1:21:28] <%Too_Much_Nukie> Also shut up about Omi.
[1:21:43] <%Too_Much_Nukie> I don't remember her being a lesbian though.
[1:21:55] <Admiral_PopnFresh> @Too_Much_Nukie beats me then, laziness on behalf of the production team? Or because alien languages have always been a way to denote "foreign" in Star Wars, so a human speaking something other than Basic is not something the producers want
[1:22:03] <subjectg> Flurry has no downsides
[1:22:09] <notsoy> flurry is technically the strongest once fully upgraded, but they're all close enough
[1:22:21] <+BDN_SEGA> @BDN_SEGA is new here. Say hello! SeemsGood
[1:22:30] <+retro_godfather> power attaqck is better for low dex
[1:22:39] <%SirGO0SE> @BDN_SEGA welcome to the end of the line
[1:22:51] <Goodvibes99508> Nnedi Okorafor, writer of the short story "The Baptist" for the anthology From a Certain Point of View, revealed Omi's name in a preview for her short story on September 16, 2017
[1:22:59] <Goodvibes99508> wookipeida
[1:23:18] <%Too_Much_Nukie> Yup. Too many feats.
[1:23:19] <GarbageQueenEllie> I thought the Monster's name was Meg.
[1:23:20] <Goodvibes99508> its real
[1:23:20] <%baka_sugoi> FEETS
[1:23:20] <Gruhunchously> Oh my God, Omi is real.
[1:23:23] <%Alazull> That's kinda the point of the class
[1:23:29] <%gitgouda> such a punny guy
[1:23:30] <CTGR_Prevention> Mandalore the UndeFEATed
[1:23:31] <%washicka> No Pat please explain
[1:23:32] <notsoy> yep, soldier/guardian is for feats
[1:23:33] <%SirGO0SE> psaDogchamp someone say feets?
[1:23:35] <subjectg> specialization:melee is a good bet @patstaresat
[1:23:37] <%BallerSwagBro9k> Pat....
[1:23:41] <HanDaimond> Feat Kreygasm
[1:23:42] <+retro_godfather> dual strike is good if other members have it, kinda a teamwork feat
[1:23:42] <subjectg> dual strike is really bad
[1:23:49] <GarbageQueenEllie> @PatStaresAt It's ok, if you have extra feats
[1:23:59] <kipperxl> quentin tarantino wants to know your location
[1:24:02] <%Too_Much_Nukie> It's not really bad, but you need multiple people to make it work.
[1:24:07] <penitentpendant> Specialization Zangief would be an interesting ability
[1:24:13] <subjectg> Grab weapon focus melee first
[1:24:25] <subjectg> oh you have it nvm
[1:24:29] <OldManDeckardCain> the omi thing is basically a fanfic that was made canon by Disney for SOME REASON
[1:24:34] <Gruhunchously> I CAN'T HOLD ALL THESE FEATS
[1:24:37] <+b_aleph> Yes you have!
[1:24:39] <%bhp_99> flurry?
[1:24:40] <+b_aleph> good for you!
[1:24:43] <Jetsfantasy> Specialization Zangief would be teaching a Mando to SPD
[1:24:45] <%SirGO0SE> Pat the other night your foot was showing on Paige's stream and you had 6 toes.
[1:24:48] <subjectg> Fuck it grab flurry or conditioning
[1:24:49] <GarbageQueenEllie> Then just waste them on whatever you want
[1:24:50] <%Undenizen> auto?
[1:24:51] <%BallerSwagBro9k> Give some to Reggie
[1:24:52] <%shurtal> Patrick Boivin, noted feat man
[1:24:52] <Gruhunchously> I guess you need to de-feat yourself.
[1:24:54] <Admiral_PopnFresh> Too Many Feats, Too many feats~
[1:24:58] <Broken_Sonex> @Gruhunchously Why does this franchise make all this Lore for characters with only 5 seconds of screen time?!
[1:24:59] <%Manjove> regen vit?
[1:25:05] <%Manjove> a good dump feat
[1:25:17] <%BallerSwagBro9k> @Broken_Sonex MUNEY
[1:25:18] <+retro_godfather> thats a good one
[1:25:27] <+Rakenshin> Where is doggo? SHOW DOGGO
[1:25:29] <+TheotherKristian> I thank the internet for motivating me to start learning about the stonks
[1:25:33] <GarbageQueenEllie> GO NUTS
[1:25:36] <%SirGO0SE> Kreygasm
[1:25:37] <Gruhunchously> Wait until we get Hanharr in the party.
[1:25:37] <subjectg> conditioning improves your saving throws, why not
[1:25:43] <%rekinom> Thanks for the clip pat
[1:25:46] <%Manjove> the other melee feats?
[1:25:49] <ape_hawk> "drowning in feet" sounds like tarantinos wet dream
[1:25:51] <ZComiX> Gordon Feetman
[1:25:54] <%toolofparanoia> STONKS!
[1:26:03] <Admiral_PopnFresh> Save this man, he's clearly drowning
[1:26:04] <Gruhunchously> The nice this is, we don't have to drag Mandalor it the darkside, he's already there.
[1:26:09] <%toolofparanoia> Buy the Doge!
[1:26:13] <NitronStreams> This truly is a day of da feet
[1:26:14] <GustauveVIII> @PatStaresAt Since you'll only be using Mandalore in only one important section (that MAINCHAR is also in) it honestly doesn't matter leveling him up.
[1:26:26] <Broken_Sonex> @BallerSwagBro9k BUT OMI HAS NO MUNEY! IT'S JUST A BIG MOSTER!!!!
[1:26:34] <%augusta_wind> you? never

Except not because I'm a huge coward and I probably missed the boat. Anyone else getting massive FOMO from this horseshit? Anyways, a propos of ninja talk earlier, Pat, did you ever play Mark of the Ninja?
[1:27:40] <Gruhunchously> It suits her
[1:27:41] <Broken_Sonex> GET THAT PAWG THAT PURPLE STUFF
[1:27:43] <%dekkitout> Is it also your favorite movie?
[1:27:45] <+b_aleph> I would like a warning to whenever you're being annoying, like just a flashing message that stays on during the entire stream

[1:38:16] <%toolofparanoia> Thats an Aquilish? Aquilian?

[1:42:55] <%BigCoffee> I'm glad Pat is playing dark side, because man does it look boring compared to being the light side
[1:43:02] <Gruhunchously> Literally disappeared.
[1:43:27] <Broken_Sonex> Red or Blue? Pick a side!
[1:43:29] <%QueequegTheater> @BigCoffee KOTOR 1 is actually way more fun as a hilarious cackling villain compared to 2
[1:43:41] <+vehementvadr> is it weird to admit kae ran looks hotter now than when she first showed up?
[1:43:59] <%QueequegTheater> Not at all, corruption is hot
[1:43:59] <Broken_Sonex> Like it's SO obvious
[1:44:03] <Gruhunchously> It's the goff make up
[1:44:07] <%barrakuta371> barrakuta371 subscribed with Prime. They've subscribed for 10 months! Hi Pat, 1 month away from 11 months. Have a job interview Monday so hopefully that works out. And if I make bank via the stock market next week, that would be nice. Wish you, Paige, Elmo, Zangief, Skelmo, and Buscelmo good health.

[1:46:08] <%Deft_Thought> "Even someone with loose context based on our conversation agrees with me. Sure she has pallid skin and horrible veins all over he face and seems to want to kill all of us but--"

[1:46:19] <subjectg> ‚ÄúSave often and in different slots‚Äù
[1:46:20] <Gruhunchously> Why?
[1:46:25] <Goodvibes99508> why?
[1:46:35] <Broken_Sonex> Why?
[1:46:40] <subjectg> Because he wanted HK in the party for that
[1:46:40] <%Ragnvaldr_AGH> you don't need HK in the party for fighting the HKs if that's your answer...
[1:46:47] <%Ragnvaldr_AGH> no he doesn't
[1:46:50] <+GADtheBAD> You meatbags
[1:46:51] <%Monkeyweed21> no he doesnt
[1:47:00] <%Too_Much_Nukie> Yes you do
[1:47:05] <penitentpendant> Insight Gained
[1:47:08] <Broken_Sonex> ALL FOR NOTHING
[1:47:15] <%Too_Much_Nukie> If HK isn't in the party you don't get progress for the HK factory.
[1:47:15] <%shurtal> Hanging on the edge of tomorrow?
[1:47:17] <Broken_Sonex> THE PAT WAY
[1:47:19] <%JJCheeker> Yes you always need hk
[1:47:20] <ZComiX> One guy
[1:47:26] <+strakillias> He only needs to be there 3 times I think
[1:47:27] <Zeldrick> Well, we already went back
[1:47:31] <%Too_Much_Nukie> He has to be there when you fight 3 or 4 groups.
[1:47:33] <Gruhunchously> @PatStaresAt He has to be in the party but not *in the party* at that moment.
[1:47:40] <penitentpendant> Save before the bit, at least
[1:47:44] <%Too_Much_Nukie> Yes he does.
[1:47:45] <%TheMattman1313> Which One Guy do you trust Pat?
[1:47:50] <%Too_Much_Nukie> He has to be in the fight.
[1:48:01] <TheHeroAppears> we are all one guy
[1:48:04] <%Too_Much_Nukie> The game tells you this.
[1:48:05] <%Huntercd> !uptime
[1:48:05] <@Moobot> I've been playing this game for how long? Oh only 1h 48m.
[1:48:07] <penitentpendant> Trust in your save files!
[1:48:12] <%JJCheeker> If you aren't using him all the times you are playing the game wrong
[1:48:13] <%Too_Much_Nukie> The changelog of the restored content mod tells you this.
[1:48:16] <%Too_Much_Nukie> It's the entire point.
[1:48:47] <%Too_Much_Nukie> That said there are like 10 HK fights now.
[1:48:52] <%Too_Much_Nukie> And you only need a few with HK.
[1:49:00] <%Too_Much_Nukie> Every area has different news.
[1:49:10] <Broken_Sonex> Don't take the whole chat Nukie, calm, plz
[1:49:12] <+RJay80> rooDevil nice karen
[1:49:33] <EldritchNeko> hey I know I'm late to this party but like boy was the medium dissappointing as fuck
[1:49:33] <%Ragnvaldr_AGH> oh, you do need him for 3 of the fights, my bad
[1:49:53] <%Daxalog> Is it the same each time?
[1:50:00] <subjectg> Fact checking will ruin this chat, apparently
[1:50:04] <Gruhunchously> SYSTEMS FAILING MASTER
[1:50:09] <%Too_Much_Nukie> @Broken_Sonex I'm not trying to take the whole chat but if Pat and chat are showing confusion about how something works I'll try to explain it.
[1:50:11] <GustauveVIII> @PatStaresAt The red-clothed human next to a guard in this area is a merchant. Don't remember what he sells, though.
[1:50:15] <TheFramedWarlock> Hey Pat !
[1:50:17] <%Ragnvaldr_AGH> that went notably better than the last fight with them
[1:50:21] <Gruhunchously> Just another day in Iziz
[1:50:27] <%Puhff> Failing muster systo
[1:50:32] <Gruhunchously> @PatStaresAt You have to return to the ship
[1:50:35] <%Too_Much_Nukie> You have to talk to him on the ship.
[1:50:38] <%Too_Much_Nukie> There will be a cutscene.
[1:50:42] <%Puhff> Cuz u bad
[1:50:43] <Broken_Sonex> @Too_Much_Nukie Do it all in one message then. Like that.

[1:50:59] <Srthunda> there is always a reason to be dramatic, it got you the answer after all
[1:51:05] <BlueLunecy> You do like those
[1:51:06] <dariusclover> It sometimes be like that
[1:51:13] <%MidnightBurst12> as a joke Kappa
[1:51:17] <%Too_Much_Nukie> You also can't do the droid factory until the end of the game anyway. You've just unlocked the ability to do it when the time comes.
[1:51:30] <subjectg> look at that line of beggars over there
[1:51:51] <%JJCheeker> Hey that's one of the default faces from the first game
[1:52:10] <%dekkitout> Does the office also isse a shirtless Visas? psaCrazyhand SeriousSloth
[1:52:13] <Broken_Sonex> @subjectg Just waiting to give you light side points
[1:52:43] <%Too_Much_Nukie> @slimmixrp Do you mean the factory or the droid planet? Pat has TSLRCM installed but not M4-78.
[1:52:48] <Gruhunchously> Onderexit
[1:53:16] <%slimmixrp> @Too_Much_Nukie The factory on Telos I never did the planet lol
[1:53:17] <%JohnAtDawn> These people act as if they wouldn't be ravaged by pirates right away if they really left the Republic
[1:53:27] <%JJCheeker> They look stinky
[1:53:37] <%SirGO0SE> credits arent real
[1:53:38] <%Too_Much_Nukie> The HK factory is lame but M4-78 is much much worse.
[1:53:39] <leinadtonu> I like your words magic man
[1:53:47] <%Huntercd> How is that bitch a queen yet subservient to the Republic?
[1:54:03] <Broken_Sonex> Give visa to Dark Side beggar, or Light Side beggar.
[1:54:10] <Mattais88> I am a legimate trader, dealing in illegal visas
[1:54:26] <%toolofparanoia> This guy sounds like he could be a TERR-OR-IST
[1:54:32] <Meekest> This is so hilariously binary
[1:54:43] <%MidnightBurst12> damn
[1:54:45] <%Too_Much_Nukie> @PatStaresAt Her daughter has the mooka shaka paka kid model.
[1:54:45] <Gruhunchously> @Broken_Sonex Ironically, this guy isn't the dark side beggar. We'll be meeting the real Dark Side beggar later on.

[1:55:44] <Gruhunchously> This is the face that Woolie had for his character.
[1:55:45] <%walternatorz> @PatStaresAt is it possible to pretend to help the family then leave them stranded?

[2:02:57] <%MelBrooksKA> Just don't commit petty treason
[2:02:58] <Mattais88> You built minipalaces for Reven?
[2:03:04] <%Too_Much_Nukie> Yeah there's a lady in the main square, she'll show up after zoning in and out.
[2:03:06] <subjectg> i‚Äôm very saddened that obsidian made a concerted effort to remove all the meme twilek lines from this game
[2:03:10] <%Manjove> they are literally threatening him with Treason for speaking, this isnt analogous to the US

[2:11:36] <%emperordread> @jorniev To allow the movement of people and goods across the Irish / Northern Irish border as before, but they are banning vaccine exports
[2:11:36] <%dekkitout> PAt, the troubles are a very touchy topic
[2:11:37] <%Too_Much_Nukie> @PatStaresAt Mando likes it if you tell him you're trying to give Vaklu a sign. Or at least doesn't hate it.

[2:13:15] <%Manjove> if you really wanted to make this like the US, Ponlar would have been entirely peaceful, Talia would have to steal the throne, and Vaklu would be the rightful leader of the planet. and all the nobles would be in on Talia stealing the throne

[2:15:57] <+Skelegroove> You could just change the game difficulty
[2:16:00] <%Too_Much_Nukie> Funfact: Nagai are a species of lizard-like warriors that Palpatine manipulated into servitude.
[2:16:01] <%slimmixrp> Can just heal whenever
[2:16:05] <%Movemeister> Charles Dance is best in Ali G in Da House

[2:42:25] <KaitlynnHere> Nooo
[2:42:39] <KaitlynnHere> Karen has big crusty
[2:42:48] <OldManDeckardCain> @scrimscromble it's the french blood LUL
[2:42:50] <+shadic7700> It‚Äôll take more than skin cream to fix that
[2:42:51] <%Too_Much_Nukie> I think if you talk to the mindflayer again he might give you an opportunity to simp for Vaklu? I don't remember honestly.
[2:43:08] <Gruhunchously> Suddenly Karen/Sion makes a lot more sense.
[2:43:40] <Admiral_PopnFresh> Bith bartenders are like Catholic Preist at a Confession, makes sense
[2:43:56] <%SirGO0SE> warm deck
[2:44:01] <RetributionP> pazzak guy
[2:44:14] <%Bailey__gaming> he called you Sentient
[2:44:16] <Gruhunchously> A stiff warm deck.
[2:44:16] <%GarbageNirvana> Amy-able?
[2:44:18] <RetributionP> warrrmmm deeccckkk
[2:44:21] <penitentpendant> Your name is Kae'ryn and this is your favorite store on Onderon?
[2:44:25] <BerryliciousDefinition> Is that Kaz?
[2:44:27] <%BallerSwagBro9k> Warm Deck Kreygasm
[2:44:31] <%El_GhostV1> psaBig warm deck
[2:44:36] <Gruhunchously> Funny you should ask...
[2:44:40] <%Monkeyweed21> you have one in your party
[2:44:43] <NitronStreams> Kaz is all over this fricken game
[2:44:44] <+shadic7700> Hey so I‚Äôm going down the KOTOR rabbit hole and was wondering! Obviously Keira loves the Exile but how does she fell about Revan?
[2:44:44] <%Too_Much_Nukie> You have to go talk to the cops before you can start investigating the murders. You only get like 2-3 extra visas.
[2:44:48] <GarbageQueenEllie> You can get one from a corpse you create later
[2:44:52] <%SirGO0SE> Visa pls open your star port Kreygasm
[2:45:01] <Gamer76255> Just yell at a manager, Pat. That always gets you what you want, right?
[2:45:08] <%SirGO0SE> LUL
[2:45:18] <Gruhunchously> @GarbageQueenEllie And by later you mean 'in three seconds'
[2:45:23] <%MidnightBurst12> amazing
[2:45:27] <OldManDeckardCain> visas wtf
[2:45:29] <%BallerSwagBro9k> @GarbageQueenEllie Knows whats up
[2:45:36] <%logoth_> "ILL KILL YOU"
[2:45:38] <%BallerSwagBro9k> Bisas plz
[2:45:39] <penitentpendant> I mean, can't you just sell yours and murder anyone who stops you for not having one? Or is there actual story stopping for that?
[2:45:42] <%TheDeceasedJester> Tell her you cant get the visa due to the virus situation
[2:45:44] <%SirGO0SE> Visas has crazy ADD in these cit scenes
[2:45:50] <%Alazull> Yeah how's that going for you?
[2:46:03] <subjectg> Fun thing: goto can call these guys off and they‚Äôll be like ‚Äúoh sorry jedi, you can go now.‚Äù
[2:46:17] <%Monkeyweed21> its wierd watching someone play this game without pausing every single turn to talk
[2:46:19] <Gruhunchously> What does this look like to the people looking on.
[2:46:22] <subjectg> and you‚Äôll still want to murder them cuz of the visa
[2:46:25] <penitentpendant> Hey, it's that corpse you mentioned!
[2:46:26] <%Too_Much_Nukie> What a useful corpse.
[2:46:38] <Meekest> Oof
[2:46:38] <%SirGO0SE> woolieMIRIN
[2:46:41] <%Alazull> Yeah it really was that bad
[2:46:41] <%logoth_> lol
[2:46:45] <+cvp5127> LUL
[2:46:50] <penitentpendant> 10 minutes of analyzing a conversation for a 3 minute conversation
[2:47:04] <%logoth_> I love Woolie but jesus christ please just attack the guy this game is easy
[2:47:07] <+zsDirtyHarry> mangoPog
[2:47:12] <penitentpendant> Bless woolie, he can make that content
[2:47:17] <%Monkeyweed21> I don't know of any LP where entire episodes were spent on levelling one character
[2:47:19] <Gruhunchously> @PatStaresAt If G0-T0 was in your party he would tell those guys to fuck off and they would leave without a fight.
[2:47:21] <OldManDeckardCain> that thin and thick book meme sums up woolie's monologues LUL
[2:47:25] <subjectg> usually punctuated by an hourly reminder that ‚Äújedi r bad mkay‚Äù
[2:47:31] <Broken_Sonex> I loved Woolie's LP but HOLY FUCK, FUCK OFF
[2:47:40] <%El_GhostV1> you have to hit them woolie
[2:47:42] <+vaderxyz1970> Stream will goes by faster when your not explaining everything under a microscope and writing a book report for you literature proffesor
[2:48:03] <Broken_Sonex> THE WOOLIE MONOLOG WAS REAL
[2:48:08] <+zsDirtyHarry> Did a big evil
[2:48:14] <Gruhunchously> To whom are you referring to you guys?
[2:48:17] <%logoth_> Did T3 just brap?
[2:48:18] <+shadic7700> GIMME SHINY
[2:48:37] <+shadic7700> Logoth NOOO
[2:48:39] <%Too_Much_Nukie> It's one of the best crystals in the game but it's restricted to the dark side of the forcce.
[2:48:41] <%Spydurman> god I love this funky jazz music
[2:48:43] <%SirGO0SE> psaBig damage
[2:48:47] <%Monkeyweed21> Woolie still feels the need to explain to his mom why everything he does isn't satanic
[2:48:47] <GarbageQueenEllie> Woolie Monologue? Did he get super stuck at this part?
[2:48:55] <penitentpendant> My favorite comparisons of current Streams. Pat/Woolie: "Stop. Stop. Stop! STOP!" Paige/Reggie: Runs around for several seconds.
[2:48:58] <RetributionP> huge pat
[2:48:59] <subjectg> I love their analysis into the nitty gritty of the game‚Äôs story, but it got a little irritating that they felt the need to allude to their very clear biases towards jedi every other part
[2:49:00] <%Broand> Are you considered dark jedi or a sith tho?
[2:49:13] <%BallerSwagBro9k> GET HUGE
[2:49:15] <%logoth_> Woolie doesn't get stuck, he just analyzes the shit out of every possible choice for 5 minutes each
[2:49:22] <Broken_Sonex> @GarbageQueenEllie No, V was there to hold his hand, it's was just Woolie at his worst.
[2:49:48] <%logoth_> and I dont say that with any malice
[2:49:50] <+NopeBadguy> so believe it or not, if you give a lightsaber the light side and dark side crystals, the restrictions cancel each other out @patstaresat
[2:50:09] <penitentpendant> Huh
[2:50:15] <GarbageQueenEllie> Oh so Woolie got everyone else stuck because he wanted to swing his academick around.
[2:50:23] <%MidnightBurst12> wierd
[2:50:31] <%logoth_> Yes
[2:50:33] <Meekest> Why not both
[2:50:34] <Broken_Sonex> BOTH
[2:50:34] <%XeroSigmaPrime> BOTH
[2:50:35] <OldManDeckardCain> both
[2:50:36] <redrins> yes
[2:50:38] <penitentpendant> It's the same root
[2:50:38] <+cvp5127> yes
[2:50:39] <+Dova573> both
[2:50:40] <%BigCoffee> Yes
[2:50:42] <Gruhunchously> BOTH
[2:50:44] <%ArchimerCXV> boffum
[2:50:45] <rei0> why not both
[2:50:45] <+shadic7700> Yes
[2:50:46] <%Manjove> yes he was
[2:50:46] <%BallerSwagBro9k> BOTH
[2:50:47] <KaiserMario> EVERY TURN
[2:50:47] <+vaderxyz1970> Yes
[2:50:47] <%logoth_> *yes*
[2:50:48] <Broken_Sonex> No. It was EVERY TURN. @PatStaresAt
[2:50:49] <%Monkeyweed21> Yes he did
[2:50:50] <%SirGO0SE> he kinda was yeah
[2:50:51] <+Dova573> PAT YOU DONT EVEN KNOW
[2:50:52] <jimjamstrawberryslamalam> Both?
[2:50:53] <subjectg> combat was the same as your kotor 1 lp
[2:50:54] <%XeroSigmaPrime> HE DID
[2:51:01] <venmode> LUL
[2:51:03] <%slimmixrp> Every one of them
[2:51:08] <RetributionP> it was pretty bad
[2:51:08] <subjectg> because real time battle is too hard
[2:51:15] <Broken_Sonex> @PatStaresAt You don't know Pat! YOU DIDN'T SEE
[2:51:19] <GarbageQueenEllie> Dude this guy's model is LITERALLY just Space Stalin
[2:51:32] <Gruhunchously> Or George Lucas
[2:51:34] <+Dova573> and thats even with Lil v helping him
[2:51:35] <+vaderxyz1970> He did a full 6 hours stream and only got through 3 scenes in 13 sentinals
[2:51:42] <subjectg> i like that they made sure to make tobin extra pasty
[2:51:47] <OldManDeckardCain> *just needs one press of the mouse to end the game* Woolie: "So let's talk about the meaning of life rn fellas"
[2:51:58] <+Dova573> 2 hours Of a RE CAP EPISODE PAT
[2:52:08] <%TheMattman1313> SPEEEEEED
[2:52:09] <Broken_Sonex> V was there to help him and HE WAS STILL SLOW AS FUCK
[2:52:17] <penitentpendant> I was having DBZ flashbacks
[2:52:19] <%GarbageNirvana> He like-a the long form
[2:52:21] <KaiserMario> *Encounter starts* Woolie: "hmmm... I think I'm gonna start with... Hmm... who, where's the guy... Ah, him... now for the attack... which ois better?"
[2:52:22] <+Dova573> he would have finished the lp an episode ago
[2:52:22] <%logoth_> Its Tokyo Mirage Sessions all over again
[2:52:22] <%BallerSwagBro9k> OOOOOOHHHHHHHH
[2:52:24] <Gruhunchously> Throwing some shade there?
[2:52:26] <%Monkeyweed21> @GarbageQueenEllie Woolie basically said on twitter that his overexplaining habit is a defense mechanism he developed cuz his holier than thou family was always looking to attack him
[2:52:26] <%El_GhostV1> psaSkelmoney psaSkelmoney
[2:52:34] <%ssjklyco> How dare Woolie not play as fast as we all do.
[2:52:41] <RetributionP> dattss an aaaaallliiinnneee
[2:52:59] <GarbageQueenEllie> @Monkeyweed21 Well now I'm sad.
[2:53:00] <%tizz86> tizz86 gifted a Tier 1 sub to RetributionP! They have given 414 Gift Subs in the channel! 
[2:53:02] <Gruhunchously> Speaking of Woolie...
[2:53:07] <penitentpendant> Sometimes you need to vent
[2:53:07] <Broken_Sonex> @PatStaresAt I was so mad he didn't keep Bastila in his party
[2:53:08] <%Monkeyweed21> V shouted "Woolie you are turning this 30 hour game into a 70 hour game" @PatStaresAt
[2:53:10] <%BallerSwagBro9k> LUL
[2:53:13] <%logoth_> That is an.... ALIIIENNNNNN
[2:53:16] <%Th3SmartAlec> Yooooo Fann Y'Pak!
[2:53:24] <roronoapedro> Quick, destroy capitalism!
[2:53:26] <+Dova573> Love his Lps though
[2:53:35] <%Kitafin> Fann
[2:53:39] <Northward12> jeeze pat lookin like a smurf
[2:53:41] <%RetributionP> Hey. thanks for that mvp
[2:53:43] <+Dova573> all this frustration is out of love
[2:53:45] <Gruhunchously> V: "Since we're currently on hour 60 of this 40 hour game..."
[2:54:09] <%BallerSwagBro9k> WHAAAAAAAAAT?
[2:54:19] <Broken_Sonex> God.....what IS a Woolie?!
[2:54:21] <+ssjklyco> I remember you and Liam were just badgering him on it
[2:54:21] <Wheelskelet10> Hey guys, is he playing the mod that completes the game I assume? Restored content mod or w/e
[2:54:27] <redrins> stopping after every conversation to think about it Kappa
[2:54:28] <%BallerSwagBro9k> JESUS CHRIST WOOLIE
[2:54:30] <Mattais88> 100 hours guessing culprit?
[2:54:32] <%Too_Much_Nukie> Yes
[2:54:34] <+NopeBadguy> LOL
[2:54:34] <+shadic7700> My first took 120 wtf
[2:54:36] <%Monkeyweed21> Woolie is a snail animorph
[2:54:40] <%Too_Much_Nukie> Pat is playing with TSLRCM for the first time.
[2:54:40] <%Alazull> I remember
[2:54:42] <+RobinFoDays> Have you played Dragon Quest 11
[2:54:43] <%dekkitout> Woolie vs Morrowind when LUL
[2:54:43] <roronoapedro> @Wheelskelet10 Yeah
[2:54:48] <%Th3SmartAlec> That doesn;t make sense, even considering his 13 Sentinels LP
[2:54:51] <%El_GhostV1> mine took like 140
[2:54:54] <GarbageQueenEllie> Woolie's fursona is a Land Tortoise, change my mind
[2:54:57] <Broken_Sonex> I'm so glad everyone is sick of Woolie's bullshit now.
[2:54:58] <%BallerSwagBro9k> I TOOK 60 HOURS
[2:55:05] <%Monkeyweed21> he talked to every npc at every point in the game
[2:55:08] <%debugdrawray_> i remember the bit where your persona 4 files gets deleted
[2:55:11] <%Ranryu692> my first true ending was at around 150, and that was new game +
[2:55:12] <+shadic7700> Talk to everyone
[2:55:13] <+b_aleph> Ever read Uzumaki? Be careful around Woolie, you don't know what his back looks like...
[2:55:25] <+NopeBadguy> I think Matt practically fell asleep that part of the podcast
[2:55:32] <KaiserMario> @PatStaresAt Ok, now it's time to stop making fun of Woolie, it's all true, but we still love him
[2:55:39] <+Gespens> Never forget his 6 minute turns in Dokapon to decide where on a LOOP he lands
[2:55:41] <redrins> woolie always goes, ok but what does it mean. and we love him for it
[2:55:44] <OldManDeckardCain> @NopeBadguy wasn't that every podcast LUL
[2:55:49] <+Dova573> give me a sec check my p4 golden save
[2:56:03] <%Alazull> @PatStaresAt The amount of times Woolies spends like ten minutes overanalyzing a line of dialogue to have it all cleared up by THE VERY NEXT LINE is astonishing
[2:56:08] <Broken_Sonex> @KaiserMario No. It's the only way he'll learn. We're done trying to be nice
[2:56:11] <GarbageQueenEllie> Can we make fun of Matt's playstyle now? I wanna cover all my bases
[2:56:23] <jimjamstrawberryslamalam> Besides the final story stuff I got 74 hours...Didnt wanna hang out with marie.
[2:56:46] <%king_wragles> My favorite is the analysis Woolie does that's wrong cause he misread a sentence
[2:56:49] <subjectg> i can‚Äôt imagine doing 200 hrs of p4, but it does remind me i have a skyrim game at 300+ hrs that i never finished
[2:56:54] <%BallerSwagBro9k> YOU WHAT?
[2:56:58] <Gruhunchously> Woolie spent two entire episodes analyzing a single conversation.
[2:56:58] <%debugdrawray_> holy fuck what
[2:57:05] <Gamer76255> Yeah but you get items in the dungeon that null
[2:57:09] <+b_aleph> Nah, that's Lucifer from Nocturne
[2:57:11] <%KuroStardust> you get Break items in the dungeon
[2:57:12] <%ballzxxtoxxyou> Yeah
[2:57:15] <%Monkeyweed21> the last dungeon is about Marie so fuck it
[2:57:27] <+shadic7700> I hate what Marie did to the final bosses story even more in the anime
[2:57:30] <%KuroStardust> yes, its not a hard fight
[2:57:33] <Gamer76255> Not sure on that because I beat her in like 3 turns
[2:57:35] <+shadic7700> She‚Äôs the worst good design tho
[2:57:38] <%KuroStardust> last more than a few thrns
[2:57:40] <%Ranryu692> KotOR 2 took forever because he and V would have the same 20 minute conversation every other line of dialogue
[2:57:44] <%El_GhostV1> The boss theme was good, the fight was Eh.
[2:57:45] <%Monkeyweed21> man fuck Marie she's awful
[2:57:46] <Gamer76255> Worst part of the dungeon is you lose half your SP after every fight
[2:57:49] <GarbageQueenEllie> Who would win: A strategic overanalyzing opponent or an impulsively unpredictable gun-jumper?
[2:58:05] <jimjamstrawberryslamalam> Eh I liked what I experienced and got the bad ending.
[2:58:10] <CTGR_Prevention> Maybe the real treasure was the credits we made along the way
[2:58:11] <%ballzxxtoxxyou> It took me 120 hrs for P4 golden
[2:58:18] <+shadic7700> All my homies hate Marie
[2:58:21] <%dekkitout> @GarbageQueenEllie Taskmaster v Deadpool- Deadpool always wins
[2:58:31] <subjectg> @garbagequeenellie funnily enough hk has an answer for that here
[2:58:32] <%RetributionP> my first persona game was 5 is it too painful to go back to p4?
[2:58:46] <%El_GhostV1> @gamer76255 I forgot oh God I forgot, duck that dungeon
[2:58:47] <jimjamstrawberryslamalam> Nah
[2:58:54] <+shadic7700> 4 golden is the best persona game
[2:59:04] <%ballzxxtoxxyou> @retributionp nope P4 is just as good
[2:59:08] <GarbageQueenEllie> I kind of liked Marie in a sort of ironic way. Kind of wish she had more depth tho. P5R Violet is way better
[2:59:08] <%Movemeister> ^
[2:59:08] <%BallerSwagBro9k> 4 IS BETTER
[2:59:10] <+AceAurora13> Sorry, this is the first stream of this I've caught. Is Pat doing a sith or jedi run?
[2:59:12] <%Monkeyweed21> as long as you dont go back to 3 FES
[2:59:14] <%SirGO0SE> I've tried to play through P4 multiple times and stop around the 12 hours mark every time. I hate that the game makes me feel like I NEED a guide to play it correctly. idk
[2:59:14] <+cvp5127> p3p is fine
[2:59:18] <penitentpendant> The QoL was added
[2:59:23] <%slimmixrp> Going to the store y'all want anything?
[2:59:24] <+b_aleph> 3FES is the superior Persona
[2:59:29] <%TheMattman1313> If only P3P still had the cutscenes
[2:59:34] <%RetributionP> woah nice
[2:59:35] <+Dova573> I like 5 and 3 more than 4
[2:59:35] <+b_aleph> 4 IS WORSE
[2:59:39] <OldManDeckardCain> people saying p4 is better are blind because of nostalgia LUL
[2:59:40] <%dekkitout> But you can say it is not worse
[2:59:40] <%BallerSwagBro9k> @shadic7700 STRAIGHT FACTS
[2:59:45] <Gamer76255> I played P5, then played P5R and wanted to play P4G, but I didn't have a Vita and so I played OG P4 and then Golden came out on Steam like 2 weeks later, so now I've played both. A bit scared to try P3 though
[2:59:48] <%kewlmyc> I do think P5G is overall the best, but P5 is the most accessible, and P3 is my personal fave
[2:59:49] <KaiserMario> @PatStaresAt Why?
[2:59:50] <+Dova573> but 3 has the worst dungeons
[2:59:50] <+shadic7700> Culprit is the best and 4 has the best OST
[3:00:00] <%RetributionP> I'll take that bet then and get it
[3:00:02] <jimjamstrawberryslamalam> Kinda like vanilla 4 better than 4G
[3:00:05] <Broken_Sonex> @SirGO0SE Yeah, you need a guide. Fuck those types of games.
[3:00:07] <Meekest> P4's characters are almost universally worse
[3:00:08] <%Monkeyweed21> P5 has the big problem that the theme is "life will change" and its written by people who dont want life to change
[3:00:11] <OldManDeckardCain> eh, idk. the ending was kinda underwhelming
[3:00:18] <+PhyrexianMemelord> P4 is more cheery and bright, P5 is cool and edgy. P3 is a dark, depressing masterpiece
[3:00:19] <Draco_Renegade> P4 Story > P5 Story
[3:00:19] <+Dova573> I honestly prefer 3s story over 4s
[3:00:22] <%abakkus> P5 aesthetics are my fav, but the story did kind of contradict its values a lot
[3:00:23] <%BallerSwagBro9k> P4 has better story and better characters
[3:00:27] <%Alazull> Even Sun?
[3:00:29] <GarbageQueenEllie> It's stupid to remake Persona games when it's clearly all meant to be one game. Just release it all the first time!!
[3:00:32] <%SirGO0SE> @Broken_Sonex literally thought I was alone in that opinion. happy to have you here :D
[3:00:33] <OldManDeckardCain> I mean, p5 has big story problems
[3:00:37] <Gamer76255> I like the main P4 cast a bit more than P5, but P5 is a better spectacle.
[3:00:44] <+shadic7700> Culprit is better than anyone in 5 barring Futaba
[3:00:46] <%Monkeyweed21> Remember when Makoto lets a sex trafficker go away scott free?
[3:00:46] <%XeroSigmaPrime> P3 would be better IF it didnt play worse
[3:00:51] <%SirGO0SE> if i have to read a guide to play a game correctly id rather watch someone else play it
[3:00:53] <+ThomasOfTroy> But daddy issues pat
[3:00:54] <%kewlmyc> P5 story is kinda messy, but so is P4s
[3:00:58] <%Movemeister> P4 has overall better ssoundtrack than 3, but 3 has better "top" moments IMO
[3:01:00] <Broken_Sonex> @SirGO0SE ANY game that needs a guide to play good it a bad game
[3:01:01] <+b_aleph> Know which has the best Sun Slink? P3...
[3:01:03] <%ArchimerCXV> went through p5r three times to max completion and each run was like 120 hours each
[3:01:04] <%KuroStardust> The P4 s links were forgettable at worst
[3:01:15] <GarbageQueenEllie> P4 for better story, P5 for better design and gameplay
[3:01:24] <OldManDeckardCain> 3rd semester in p5 royal has better writing than the whole p5 LUL
[3:01:30] <%SirGO0SE> @Broken_Sonex based as fuck
[3:01:31] <%RetributionP> as long as there are no moments as bad as morgana being a huge baby. I'm fine
[3:01:34] <+Dova573> Ill fight peope that 3s and 5s osts are better than 4
[3:01:35] <+shadic7700> 3 has the best true boss 4 has the best normal boss and 5 is just a overall polished game
[3:01:39] <Jetsfantasy> Wait, you didn't flip out over Priestess's ending in P4?
[3:01:45] <%BigCoffee> Which P5 *** is bullshit?
[3:02:00] <+ThomasOfTroy> @RetributionP Dude, Teddie is infinitely worse than Morgana
[3:02:07] <+shadic7700> Also 4 has Heartbeat Heartbreak and Heaven
[3:02:08] <%XeroSigmaPrime> Yea the P5R really elevated it with the additional stuff. Easily the best
[3:02:17] <Meekest> How does hers end again
[3:02:19] <%BigCoffee> Nah, fuck Morgana. Teddie is just a lovable dumbass
[3:02:26] <%BallerSwagBro9k> P4G GOT
[3:02:28] <+shadic7700> OH MAN
[3:02:29] <%BallerSwagBro9k> GOAT
[3:02:30] <%Monkeyweed21> Makoto's S-Link is even worse
[3:02:31] <GarbageQueenEllie> Wait, what about P4 Priestess? I forget
[3:02:46] <+shadic7700> FACK I forgot futabas end link
[3:02:53] <%BigCoffee> Makoto's entire story is the same as her. Boring and functional
[3:02:57] <+b_aleph> @GarbageQueenEllie Yukiko
[3:03:07] <+shadic7700> That‚Äôs soo f‚Äôed up
[3:03:10] <%TheMattman1313> Shit talking your friends to their face is "odd"?
[3:03:10] <$Futurecity10> None of this matters because persona 3 is the best
[3:03:24] <jimjamstrawberryslamalam> Lol
[3:03:27] <GarbageQueenEllie> @b_aleph Yeah, but what about it was fucked up? I only remember pieces of it
[3:03:28] <OldManDeckardCain> atlus didn't think through futaba's ending. they could have avoided that bs, but alas
[3:03:33] <+b_aleph> Ye, P3 rocks
[3:03:34] <%BigCoffee> Persona's story is great but I never want to play it ever again
[3:03:40] <+shadic7700> 3 is ok the final boss is the best in the modern 3
[3:03:41] <%RetributionP> yeah morgana was great but that one weird moment where he was uncharacteristically stubborn. that's the bad part
[3:03:45] <%XeroSigmaPrime> @Futurecity10 yea except P5R is the best
[3:03:47] <%BigCoffee> @OldManDeckardCain How does it end for her again%
[3:03:50] <+koalaf1ed> Hello! we playing pazaak
[3:03:58] <faithless_zealot> Matt Damon, is that you?
[3:03:59] <Jetsfantasy> @GarbageQueenEllie The problem was that it ends the complete opposite of what the problem was with her
[3:04:02] <+ThomasOfTroy> I liked Royal, but it ruined the romance scenes with Kawakami
[3:04:06] <%Monkeyweed21> oh god I forgot that Haru's shithead fiance gets away
[3:04:09] <%BigCoffee> @RetributionP You're gonna excuse the constant simping? And pissing on ryuji for like 100 hours?
[3:04:14] <dariusclover> pazaak was the murderer
[3:04:20] <+b_aleph> @GarbageQueenEllie I could tell you, but it's better if you just watch Woolie ranting about, he has done it many times now
[3:04:35] <%XeroSigmaPrime> The only bad thing about Royal is the lack of a Sae romance
[3:04:35] <%Mr_Pylon> doc's cool
[3:04:36] <GarbageQueenEllie> @b_aleph Oh geez ok
[3:04:53] <%SirGO0SE> oh ya you talked about this
[3:04:54] <intestinal_bleeding> Piggy
[3:05:01] <%minimumeffortmaximumderp> minimumeffortmaximumderp subscribed with Prime. They've subscribed for 5 months! Pat is never wrong
[3:05:34] <+shadic7700> Hey pat quick question who do you prefer lore wise Revan or the Exile?
[3:05:38] <%SirGO0SE> same
[3:05:43] <%baron_of_salt> baron_of_salt subscribed at Tier 1. 
[3:05:45] <%Movemeister> Each time I hear Valhalla I keep thinking he's talking about the visual novel game
[3:05:48] <+RobertThePatriot> Is this going on youtube?
[3:05:49] <Holofono> stop, this hits too close
[3:05:50] <%RetributionP> yes and he was an unacceptable to ryuji during that arc. the rest was just playful.
[3:05:52] <%baron_of_salt> When DS2 SOTFS came out, I started playing it after finishing up Pat and Woolie's DS2 LP, and after about 2 hours I screamed at my TV because I didn't understand why my playthrough was so different.
[3:05:56] <SaltyAzteca> @PatStaresAt Im trying to commit this year to clearing out the library I have right now, playing Brigador
[3:05:57] <+Dova573> the last time I felt like that with an AC game was with 2 and ezio
[3:05:58] <%ssjklyco> 200 seems like a short list for you
[3:06:01] <%asylumkon> i had trouble doing side content in yakuza 0 because of how fast paced the story is and it always fellt like i had to do it
[3:06:08] <KaiserMario> In Kyle Bosman's stream of this game, he's doing this fun betting thing on chat, we bet Channel Points on wether he'll win a match, people were making over 100k per match
[3:06:09] <+RobertThePatriot> Asking because I want to watch it again later
[3:06:11] <%Monkeyweed21> can anyone remember the story of Watch Dogs Legion?
[3:06:11] <%GarbageNirvana> Return of Mystery Box?
[3:06:19] <%ssjklyco> Just do it.
[3:06:22] <+cvp5127> that the good shit
[3:06:26] <%BallerSwagBro9k> DO IT
[3:06:35] <%ssjklyco> With the guide, it's still 110 hours for P5R
[3:06:36] <GarbageQueenEllie> I hated Akechi in like a positive way, b/c it's awesome, but I hate Morgana out of disappointment of how shit he is
[3:06:40] <+Dova573> you gonna wait on strikers?
[3:06:46] <%BallerSwagBro9k> RIGHT?
[3:06:48] <SaltyAzteca> JUST, mmm, DO IT
[3:06:57] <%Alazull> Do it next time you take a break?
[3:06:58] <+b_aleph> Have you played P3?
[3:07:03] <%BigCoffee> @ssjklyco you can always skip all the shit you've already seen and shave 10-20h
[3:07:06] <+Joysta> it's the old good instead of the big maybe
[3:07:06] <+shadic7700> I‚Äôm on December of Royal but my PS4 died so rip
[3:07:08] <subjectg> sometimes the new shit isn‚Äôt enjoyable man
[3:07:34] <%ArchimerCXV> @PatStaresAt a lot of the guides for p5r are garbage because they believe ng+ is too easy to need one and the one's for max slinks on a brand new game pull some BS like double dipping romances
[3:07:39] <Meekest> VLR is the best game in the ZE series
[3:07:43] <Jetsfantasy> I need to redo Akechi's dungeon in P4G cause I didn't think it'd just skip to the end of the month. Mind goblins are making me optimize the month now
[3:07:49] <Meekest> And after VLR you stop playing LUL
[3:08:00] <faithless_zealot> What's VLR?
[3:08:04] <subjectg> i guess it‚Äôs the fear of making a big commitment? that‚Äôs my two cents
[3:08:06] <%Broand> I heard the last game in the series sucked though
[3:08:14] <subjectg> virtue‚Äôs last reward
[3:08:29] <faithless_zealot> @subjectg Thanks
[3:08:31] <GarbageQueenEllie> I'm glad so many people are as pissed off by Morgana's presence as I am
[3:08:32] <%GarbageNirvana> isn't that the game the Danganronpa guy made before Danganronpa
[3:08:40] <+NopeBadguy> did you pick up Sam and max with those mystery games?
[3:08:51] <+b_aleph> Nooo, I love Morgana
[3:09:02] <+b_aleph> My notification alert is Mona meowing
[3:09:26] <+Dova573> morgana is a stupid cat that I enjoy shit talking and laughing at his ass
[3:09:27] <GarbageQueenEllie> Just my opinion, but I would take 5 Teddies AND a Marie over only half of a Morgana
[3:09:32] <RazYamiyo> eliseaLEFT psaSmug eliseaRIGHT you will tell me about the droids
[3:09:37] <+shadic7700> I like teddie more than Mona but he‚Äôs cool
[3:10:06] <Meekest> That's valid
[3:10:10] <%Monkeyweed21> fuck every girl and give them the turbo drip
[3:10:12] <+cvp5127> man whore is the way to go
[3:10:17] <%ssjklyco> He's not JOKING around
[3:10:22] <OldManDeckardCain> a storm that is approaching Kappa
[3:10:23] <%shurtal> So a mr. burns esque immune system?
[3:10:23] <Meekest> Good ol' poison dick
[3:10:24] <+wolfofsound> like mr. burns, they can't all fit in the door
[3:10:26] <+b_aleph> Just like Mr Burns' syndrome, but sexual
[3:10:26] <%Monkeyweed21> Nasty Crime Boi
[3:10:29] <+Dova573> the real truth is morgand and teddie > Aegis
[3:10:33] <%BigCoffee> start with the adults, continue with the classmates, finish with the sister
[3:10:33] <Jetsfantasy> STD's give Joker stat boosts
[3:10:37] <+Dova573> morgana
[3:10:40] <+RobinFoDays> Sin Devil Triggers?
[3:10:41] <%dekkitout> tajC
[3:10:42] <+vaderxyz1970> Then dump Kawakami after she gives out massages for free stil?
[3:10:43] <%MidnightBurst12> Papa Nurgle will be pleased
[3:10:43] <%Huntercd> knock up those 9 women
[3:10:45] <Meekest> Only the greenest cum
[3:10:49] <%Zundelle> as long as his dick is moving it wards off the negative effect of 100 STDs
[3:10:49] <+shadic7700> Yu is a chad who would date them all but stay celibate cause he doesn‚Äôt know what actual sex is
[3:10:51] <%El_GhostV1> Invincible
[3:10:56] <%XeroSigmaPrime> Its true, my brain tumor and AIDS have been fighting each other for years now
[3:10:56] <$Futurecity10> That‚Äôs bullshit, I followed a day guide and 100%ed p5r
[3:10:58] <GarbageQueenEllie> I would've totally romanced Makoto if they made her SLink half as interesting as her awakening
[3:11:02] <+campasino> This NPC looks 12 yrs old
[3:11:03] <subjectg> the warmest, cheesiest man milk
[3:11:07] <Gamer76255> Yet Rise is still the only one to tell the MC that he "really gets me going" constantly
[3:11:07] <%Ranryu692> I should play P5R. I started playing P5 hours after hitting the credits on P4G, and that writing takes a huge step down imo, so maybe I need to give it another shot
[3:11:15] <%chiazam> There's only two people in that game worth dating and they're sisters
[3:11:27] <+Kingtut9009> Pat why are you talking to Star Wars Master Miller
[3:11:41] <+b_aleph> Joker will bring Japan's birth rates up BY HIMSELF
[3:11:45] <GarbageQueenEllie> @chiazam That's right. Purple and Purple.
[3:11:46] <+Dova573> Aw man Ichiban gets a persona Valentine's day substory and its the best
[3:11:55] <Jetsfantasy> Rise feels like a stockholm syndrome case to me, I don't like it being considered the canon run
[3:11:57] <%AzureGale> Zangief is DEAD!?!?!?!? jk
[3:12:00] <+vaderxyz1970> Just dont eat a bannana
[3:12:06] <+shadic7700> RIP
[3:12:08] <+TitaniumDragoonNeo> @Futurecity10 Same. Even with optimization, you can finish everything with pretty much all of the new month free for you do with as you please.
[3:12:12] <%wibbwobbler> good job
[3:12:20] <%SirGO0SE> psaCrazyhand poop loading
[3:12:23] <Broken_Sonex> @Jetsfantasy And yet, it is.
[3:12:23] <lloyddboy> BUY LOW SELL HIGH
[3:12:25] <Paciboyy> @Jetsfantasy marie is canon now... yay....
[3:12:28] <GarbageQueenEllie> @Jetsfantasy lol I knew she was thirsty but that's a new one
[3:12:36] <%AzureGale> Was that barf
[3:12:36] <%RetributionP> when no food dog turns off
[3:12:39] <%XeroSigmaPrime> WOW THAT DROID IS A SHORT SEELING HEDGE FUNDER
[3:12:48] <AMUSERNAME> STONKS Droid
[3:12:49] <Gamer76255> I really thought the robot just said Tolas the TRAITOR and was super confused about who would actively name themselves that
[3:12:53] <+shadic7700> Ok so this robot voice is the worst I‚Äôd take t3 over that any day
[3:13:06] <%Daxalog> Why do dogs dream so much?
[3:13:15] <Krimxon> ahh Pat fixed the bug?
[3:13:15] <GarbageQueenEllie> As long as I get to have my Naoto Shrine, the other girls can fuck off
[3:13:21] <subjectg> do dogs dream of electric sheep
[3:13:27] <+NopeBadguy> weewoo
[3:13:41] <+b_aleph> dogs dream of electric cheese
[3:13:42] <Broken_Sonex> @Daxalog It's because they're dreaming of their past life.
[3:13:48] <OldManDeckardCain> @subjectg no, they dream of food
[3:14:02] <%RetributionP> zangif dreams of floating hams
[3:14:04] <%Too_Much_Nukie> @PatStaresAt I can tell you where to get the droid's head if you want.
[3:14:05] <Paciboyy> Yu's weird because there's no good pairings for him, aside from yosuke
[3:14:26] <derap41> did you get a psych degree for dogs?
[3:14:36] <derap41> Is that why you stream games?
[3:14:41] <Meekest> Yosuke deserves to be alone
[3:14:43] <+b_aleph> How does that make the dog feel?
[3:14:44] <faithless_zealot> That's weirdly insightful coming from Pat =|
[3:14:45] <%AzureGale> That has been your #DogFax minute with Pat
[3:14:51] <+shadic7700> Yu/yoskue is the only gay pair I actively push in persona for some reason it‚Äôs just right
[3:14:53] <Midnight188> reminds me my kitty is getting older. she does the kickies when she dreams sometimes.
[3:14:56] <%Monkeyweed21> my dog has bad dreams sometimes and I have to cuddle him in the middle of the night
[3:14:59] <GarbageQueenEllie> @Meekest lol I actually kind of agree
[3:15:00] <%SirGO0SE> i always get scared my pup is having a nightmare and cuddle her when she do the dream growls
[3:15:02] <%Too_Much_Nukie> Joker is weird because the best pairings for him are adult women and he's a high schooler.
[3:15:08] <derap41> Baby face
[3:15:16] <%RetributionP> I don't know if you know this but pat is basicly a doctor
[3:15:17] <%Puhff> Oh because that part of the brain deteorates with age
[3:15:26] <%Puhff> Neat !
[3:15:29] <%Too_Much_Nukie> @PatStaresAt You have to buy it from the droid outside.
[3:15:33] <%JJCheeker> Fact number 2 dogs like to lick their butt
[3:15:34] <%cylish> in the garbage out side for droid head
[3:15:34] <%Too_Much_Nukie> Someone stole it and sold it to him.
[3:15:38] <subjectg> the droid head is with the droid
[3:15:38] <GarbageQueenEllie> I dunno man, Joker/Violet is pretty powerful
[3:15:39] <%Ipsenscastle> Ipsenscastle subscribed with Prime. They've subscribed for 7 months! Have you played the ps2 game Heatseeker? It's basically to Ace Combat as Burnout is to Gran Turismo. Not a stream game, but worth a ten minute look! It go whoosh.
[3:15:41] <Broken_Sonex> @Too_Much_Nukie You say that like it's a bad thing
[3:15:53] <%SirGO0SE> @JJCheeker you would too if you could
[3:16:03] <KaitlynnHere> Help me obi wan kenobi, I‚Äôm constipated

[3:16:31] <AShinyVagikarp> DogChamp
[3:16:34] <Krimxon> did he do a judgement cut as he resheathed?
[3:16:35] <+Badendchan> "Dicks Out For Tummy Numnums" is a phrase
[3:16:36] <%Huntercd> dick sheath
[3:16:37] <+wolfofsound> Wow zangeif must be a redditor cus he's riding the rocket LUL
[3:16:40] <%thedankestmeeme> put it away step bro!
[3:16:45] <%Too_Much_Nukie> It's in dialogue not his store menu.
[3:16:48] <%slimmixrp> Its theough dialogue
[3:16:50] <+shadic7700> Harambe didn‚Äôt die for this
[3:16:53] <subjectg> it‚Äôs a conversation
[3:16:56] <%RetributionP> he shlorped it back in psaDogchamp
[3:16:57] <%slimmixrp> You talk to him not store
[3:17:00] <GarbageQueenEllie> I loved the Faith Confidant- restarted the whole damn NG+ for it
[3:17:10] <KaiserMario> Does Paige car about Star Wars?
[3:17:13] <%Ipsenscastle> that's such a halfassed robot voice
[3:17:18] <KaiserMario> *care...
[3:17:18] <%Puhff> At least it isn't Elmo's barbed nightmare dick
[3:17:31] <%Too_Much_Nukie> It should show up in his dialogue after talking to the beast masters in the store about the droid.
[3:17:39] <%slimmixrp> Talk to the scavenger guy in the bar about it first maybe
[3:17:41] <%Too_Much_Nukie> In the cantina I mean.
[3:17:44] <subjectg> @patstaresat talk to the dude next to the holo dancers, he tells you to buy it from the droid
[3:18:01] <%Too_Much_Nukie> Yeah it's frustrating.
[3:18:05] <Broken_Sonex> He dosn't.......understand.....how to get the droid......
[3:18:17] <jacewolf_is_the_best> feeling good as u look
[3:18:25] <subjectg> to be fair i forgot that dude existed so i can relate
[3:18:35] <%JJCheeker> I used to have 2 Chihuahua brothers and they would 69
[3:18:38] <%Monkeyweed21> depends on the type of game
[3:18:50] <%SirGO0SE> ^
[3:18:50] <Broken_Sonex> @PatStaresAt It's okay, Pat. You're still WAY faster than Woolie
[3:18:56] <%asylumkon> unraveling the murder mystery is my least favorite part of this game
[3:18:57] <+b_aleph> @JJCheeker nice
[3:18:59] <%Too_Much_Nukie> I enjoy replaying games and do it often. I also spend almost all of my free time playing games though, usually with something going on my TV or phone.
[3:19:05] <GarbageQueenEllie> Ngl, I really wish you could've played as a chick in P4G. Would've been a blast.
[3:19:16] <+AngriestAngryArtist> whirrrrrrrrrr
[3:19:19] <%dekkitout> Coffee tree ThankEgg
[3:19:23] <%Too_Much_Nukie> I'
[3:19:25] <+b_aleph> @GarbageQueenEllie you can in p3p...
[3:19:29] <subjectg> man that noise is horrid
[3:19:29] <%asgard147> brrrrrrrrrrrrrrr
[3:19:30] <+Dova573> most of my replaying was beacuse I dint have money to buy a new one
[3:19:31] <%GarbageNirvana> sometimes I'll pick up a game I've already played before because it's cheap
[3:19:32] <+b_aleph> but 3FES is better!
[3:19:34] <jacewolf_is_the_best> oh boy
[3:19:34] <Meekest> Feel bad for us we had to watch it
[3:19:36] <%SirGO0SE> the difference between a streamer and youtuber Kappa
[3:19:38] <%Too_Much_Nukie> *I'd only want to play as a chick in P4 if I could turn Naoto gay.
[3:19:39] <%Blank9> SPEED
[3:19:43] <GarbageQueenEllie> @b_aleph But can you fuck the Robot???
[3:19:53] <+Mailboy> The horse would be like 6 pats tall
[3:19:55] <Broken_Sonex> We all get to see how bad he is at video games @PatStaresAt
[3:19:58] <+Mailboy> so like a normal horse
[3:20:03] <%TheMattman1313> I'll still make fun of both of you for Snailborne
[3:20:06] <%AzureGale> psaDogchamp
[3:20:09] <Gamer76255> Pat riding on a horse seems a bit ambitious. Maybe a donkey
[3:20:11] <GarbageQueenEllie> @Too_Much_Nukie So much this. All my yes.
[3:20:11] <%Monkeyweed21> remember when woolie took like 30 or 40 minutes in the tutorial battles in 13 sentinels
[3:20:11] <+Dova573> But Arkham asylum and city were really replayable for me
[3:20:11] <+b_aleph> @GarbageQueenEllie yes, but robot sex is different than human sex
[3:20:12] <%GarbageNirvana> Big chunker
[3:20:12] <%rumtumtugnutz> oh boy, I think I got here just in time to miss the stream.
[3:20:19] <%asgard147> limesAw psaDogchamp

[3:20:30] <GarbageQueenEllie> @b_aleph Doesn't matter, had sex!

[3:20:33] <faithless_zealot> monkaW

[3:20:39] <%rumtumtugnutz> !uptime
[3:20:39] <@Moobot> I've been playing this game for how long? Oh only 3h 20m.
[3:20:44] <Broken_Sonex> @Monkeyweed21 FUCK. THAT.
[3:20:47] <+NopeBadguy> there's something about the way you said the difference that sounds like you're insulting his intelligence
[3:20:48] <%TheBensonator_> Zangief? More like MANgief with how psaBig dat boi is
[3:20:49] <faithless_zealot> LULW
[3:20:49] <%AzureGale> How casual
[3:20:49] <%SirGO0SE> wus dat smell
[3:20:51] <KaitlynnHere> Blood?
[3:20:53] <%Too_Much_Nukie> Zangief sounds just like the boma from earlier in the stream.
[3:20:54] <faithless_zealot> Pat, stop!
[3:20:55] <SaltyAzteca> WutFace
[3:20:56] <%gksnipa> theres always blood on my hands - pat 2021

[3:21:05] <%TheMattman1313> Sounds like you might need a humidifier @PatStaresAt
[3:21:08] <+wolfofsound> @PatStaresAt blood on your hands? I thought only woolie has killed a man
[3:21:10] <Broken_Sonex> @NopeBadguy He is.
[3:21:13] <derap41> Man he is huge
[3:21:13] <%asgard147> ah yes, the face period
[3:21:17] <Midnight188> pigdog needs his post-numnum bath
[3:21:18] <%debugdrawray_> hes very good about that
[3:21:20] <GarbageQueenEllie> @PatStaresAt wants to audience cuck Woolie
[3:21:22] <+Dova573> I wont ever forgive woolie for doing a Recap episode to come to a conclusion that the game tells him is wrong the next chapter
[3:21:24] <%rumtumtugnutz> nose period day
[3:21:26] <+oktavia_von> pupper!

[3:22:38] <TheHeroAppears> I started scream yesterday while trying to train the dog in Yakuza 3
[3:22:42] <Broken_Sonex> Okay, but I think the problem for real is that Woolie is a youtuber and not a streamer. He's VERY old school.
[3:22:43] <%rumtumtugnutz> he's learned the pattern
[3:22:43] <derap41> I thought we had a deal here Pat!
[3:22:43] <%Puhff> He's reading your inputs
[3:22:47] <Meekest> @PatStaresAt Did you see today's Bayonetta 3 news?
[3:22:53] <%toolofparanoia> He's learned the meta, TIME FOR A REWORK
[3:23:05] <%SirGO0SE> @Meekest that shit made me LUL
[3:23:11] <%Monkeyweed21> Gief sees the matrix code
[3:23:18] <+b_aleph> I hope Woolie streams Jet Set Radio Future next...
[3:23:18] <Krimxon> if Zangief can predict you it sounds like you're gonna get command grabbed any day now
[3:23:35] <%rumtumtugnutz> time for a patch update to change raid mechanics. no more stacking taunts.
[3:23:40] <faithless_zealot> D:

[3:24:12] <%cowardman93> he a fatty piggy dog
[3:24:14] <Broken_Sonex> @cvp5127 There are many games he picks to LP i wish he just did in private.
[3:24:16] <+strakillias> Wait his name is 1bated?
[3:24:20] <%rumtumtugnutz> it's probably not Norm McDonald
[3:24:22] <Meekest> LUL
[3:24:24] <%cowardman93> yup
[3:24:28] <+b_aleph> @GarbageQueenEllie both the mcs are, they died for our sins!
[3:24:45] <%cowardman93> the joys of a gross piggy dog, you're lucky if the noise is out the mouth
[3:24:45] <GarbageQueenEllie> @b_aleph Just like Optimus Prime.

[3:26:51] <%slimmixrp> This fucking vid shows nothing cause she was dead and shot before the video even started lol
[3:27:01] <%slimmixrp> So like they could have just went to the other side after
[3:27:16] <%Puhff> I hate his head
[3:27:21] <Cheekynub> hey pat hey chat
[3:27:50] <%Dakuu75> I DIDN'T DO IT
[3:28:03] <%Ranryu692> oh yeah, it's Woolie's face
[3:28:25] <%Dakuu75> hate doesn't imediately imply murder, you witch hunting bitch
[3:28:48] <penitentpendant> Show them a transcript of any stream involving Pat/Paige/Plague
[3:28:54] <+Dova573> is that old guys the clone wars narrator?
[3:28:54] <GarbageQueenEllie> The crueler the words, the better friends you are
[3:28:59] <Broken_Sonex> Look how WE talk about Woolie!
[3:28:59] <%gksnipa> friends who are close always talk shit
[3:29:00] <%emperordread> ACAB
[3:29:03] <+Dova573> 'old guy
[3:29:18] <%GarbageNirvana> Shut up, white Morgan Freeman
[3:29:33] <%emperordread> @GarbageNirvana LUL
[3:29:35] <derap41> Freeman?
[3:29:38] <%Dakuu75> @GarbageNirvana lol
[3:29:42] <GarbageQueenEllie> See: TV Tropes- Vitriolic Best Buds
[3:29:53] <derap41> How the fuck they'd afford Morgan Freeman
[3:29:58] <%ArchimerCXV> on Onderon we Open Carry
[3:30:01] <penitentpendant> Aren't they in Martial Law?
[3:30:02] <%SomeSageAdvice> they're cops, they always have them drawn
[3:30:13] <dariusclover> Suns out guns out
[3:30:14] <%Alazull> I dunno, why do you have your lightsabers in your hands?
[3:30:19] <VioletRosefall> dont you also walk around with weapons drawn?
[3:30:29] <subjectg> considering you just had a riot with multiple dead officers, would you NOT have your gun out?
[3:30:32] <derap41> Every FPS game
[3:30:42] <%GalacticaPhanto> because they strapped. Shottaz:Onderon
[3:30:52] <GarbageQueenEllie> The real reason is that it's too code-intensive to phase the weapons in and out of existence
[3:31:07] <%Alazull> There is no way to be polite with a gun in your hand
[3:31:07] <penitentpendant> Reminds me of Bioshock 1, you character lowers you weapon for some scenes
[3:31:12] <+vehementvadr> I
[3:31:21] <dariusclover> Ive been at larps where people did that
[3:31:22] <Gruhunchously> I like how in Deus Ex Human Revolution people will flat-out not talk to you unless you put your gun away.
[3:31:23] <faithless_zealot> There's some games that give you a -CHA mod if you have your weapon drawn while talking for NPC's, or some such
[3:31:24] <%Monkeyweed21> then there's cyberpunk where props like food and utensils get replaced with guns cuz glitches
[3:31:29] <+vehementvadr> its called being American pat
[3:31:32] <%MelBrooksKA> "Look at this gun! Is it yours!?"
[3:31:33] <%Alazull> That's even more concerning
[3:31:36] <%JJCheeker> Just what your weapon hang
[3:31:37] <%MidnightBurst12> even worse
[3:31:42] <%SirGO0SE> KKona now you're speakin' American
[3:31:45] <%JJCheeker> Let
[3:31:46] <%Dakuu75> if your pointing the gun at your own head, I think you can appear pretty polite
[3:31:47] <%ShogunNoonto> is the gun your penis ?
[3:31:48] <+shadic7700> Depends on size
[3:31:50] <subjectg> @dariusclover did they bob their heads up and down while speaking too?
[3:32:00] <penitentpendant> Naked with a gun in hand? Definitely sounds American.
[3:32:03] <+vehementvadr> that's sounds like a Florida custom
[3:32:06] <%Movemeister> If you‚Äôre naked, become as gun Kreygasm
[3:32:28] <GarbageQueenEllie> @penitentpendant Not totally naked. We wear cowboy hats
[3:32:30] <Gruhunchously> Guy just insulted you to your face.
[3:32:38] <VioletRosefall> its the baby!
[3:32:50] <%WizardPants1134> In Oblivion, NPC disposition would change when you draw a weapon
[3:32:52] <penitentpendant> @GarbageQueenEllie For the class, of course
[3:32:58] <%Dakuu75> jesus-fucking-christ, these building have ZERO sound dampening.
[3:32:59] <HotMafia81> Uuuuugghghgh he's so smaaaaart immafucking die.
[3:33:09] <+shadic7700> Paige Persona?
[3:33:15] <+Delenay> i keep thinking those airships sound effects are about to crash
[3:33:24] <%Dakuu75> is there a SKY LIGHT OPEN in this building, why is it SO LOUD!!! lol
[3:33:35] <subjectg> The door is open
[3:33:46] <Gruhunchously> The door's open
[3:34:07] <%ShogunNoonto> swoop bike go wraaaaaaaaaa
[3:34:12] <subjectg> what‚Äôs more egregious was when the same noises were playing in the throne room of the palace
[3:34:24] <%Zundelle> "oh boy it's time to play Dragon's Dogma again"
[3:34:25] <derap41> I Replay Dark Souls every month or so
[3:34:37] <%SirGO0SE> people read books multiple times so I dont see the problem
[3:34:39] <%ssjklyco> You're technically doing that right now with a game you already beaten
[3:34:54] <+shadic7700> ^
[3:34:56] <GarbageQueenEllie> There's a reason I replay all these old ass rpgs. I just can't be bothered to do the other new things
[3:34:58] <derap41> Paige those mods never get done
[3:35:05] <+Skelegroove> Is that ever going to come out
[3:35:06] <Boozeyclues> When's Skyblivion coming out???
[3:35:10] <%Ranryu692> @ssjklyco this is for profit, though, so it's a different situation
[3:35:15] <Matt_Cowdery> Hey im part of that modding group!
[3:35:15] <Broken_Sonex> What about Skywind?
[3:35:16] <Bluewolf544> I go back to games i like CONSTANTLY
[3:35:18] <%Monkeyweed21> Skywind tho
[3:35:18] <%ArchimerCXV> oblivion is the tradegy of BLOOOOOOOM
[3:35:18] <Gruhunchously> Oblivion is a shockingly ugly game
[3:35:22] <%AncelDeLambert> Oblivion is horrendous
[3:35:24] <%ShogunNoonto> isn't skyrim more falling apart
[3:35:25] <%emperordread> Morrowind is pure (except for the cliff racers)
[3:35:34] <Matt_Cowdery> No fuckin clue!
[3:35:34] <%teamzackattack> ALL I want to do is play shit I've already played these days. I LOVE 13 sentinels and all I wanna play is FF9 for the 6th time
[3:35:39] <Matt_Cowdery> I just make armor
[3:35:42] <subjectg> praise jiub
[3:35:43] <%SirGO0SE> LUL
[3:35:47] <+oktavia_von> rent must be cheap if traffic is this close
[3:35:48] <$Futurecity10> Wait what happened with sky wind
[3:35:49] <GarbageQueenEllie> Oblivion is ugly, but in a way that I kind of like? Is that weird??
[3:35:53] <Bluewolf544> Didn't the skyrim morrowind mod already release huge parts ??
[3:35:56] <%teamzackattack> sipsipRude
[3:35:59] <derap41> Elmo is being eaten
[3:36:00] <%PanicSwytch> I have to replay Megaman X and X2 once a year
[3:36:06] <%AncelDeLambert> OH NOES ELMO
[3:36:07] <OldManDeckardCain> RKO OUT OD NOWHERE
[3:36:14] <TrollKing96> Speaking of P5, how the fuck do you guys decide on your party?
[3:36:18] <Broken_Sonex> Seriously, what's happening with Skywind?
[3:36:19] <+vehementvadr> Elmo doll is ded
[3:36:20] <%RetributionP> rip elmo
[3:36:22] <%Movemeister> The humanity
[3:36:26] <%AzureGale> Oh, the humanity!
[3:36:32] <Bluewolf544> @trollking96 all waifus and one bro
[3:36:38] <Gruhunchously> RIP
[3:36:39] <+shadic7700> Characters I like end of party
[3:36:54] <GarbageQueenEllie> I loved the environments and imperial city in Oblivion, Cyrodiilian trees were so pretty. But characters were fugly
[3:37:00] <subjectg> oh shit the door‚Äôs closed
[3:37:02] <%RetributionP> because elmo is so busted you can't tell the difference between doll elmo and elmo
[3:37:04] <%Movemeister> I just rotate party constantly so they‚Äôre all the same level
[3:37:23] <Bluewolf544> Oblivion aged worse than morrowind
[3:37:33] <%Movemeister> Until you get that sweet confident bonus
[3:37:40] <Gamer76255> @TrollKing96 In the base game I just use Ann, Ryuji and Makoto for Charge/Concentrate and Healer. In Royal I tend to use Yusuke, Makoto and Morgana to take advantage of the Jazz Club. May rotate a bit as needed, like Haru for Technicals.
[3:37:42] <Bluewolf544> morrowind had much better atmosphere
[3:37:51] <Gruhunchously> @PatStaresAt Did you talk to the lady in the square about the captions you dealt with?
[3:37:57] <Gruhunchously> *captains
[3:38:06] <+Skelegroove> Oblivion has one of the worst levelling systems ever devised
[3:38:09] <%PanicSwytch> My P5 party is makoto, anne and ryuji
[3:38:27] <%emperordread> @Skelegroove correct
[3:38:27] <Broken_Sonex> @Bluewolf544 Yeah, that's why I'm looking for to Skywind more. If it ever comes out that is.
[3:39:04] <%RetributionP> my P5 party was morgana Makoto ryuji
[3:39:06] <%Movemeister> For platinuming P5 I used makoto ryuji anne
[3:39:13] <GarbageQueenEllie> I'd forget about Skyrim, if I weren't so goddamn thirsty for Vampire babes
[3:39:34] <%Ranryu692> Viridian
[3:39:38] <+Mumbles519> viridian
[3:39:39] <Gruhunchously> @GarbageQueenEllie So how's RE8 looking?
[3:39:40] <%Movemeister> Otherwise it was Ryuji, Makoto and Haru
[3:39:41] <%Too_Much_Nukie> It's Viridian
[3:39:43] <+oktavia_von> same
[3:39:52] <%Ranryu692> @PatStaresAt it is a different green, it's viridian
[3:39:55] <Broken_Sonex> @GarbageQueenEllie Vampire Women are like one of the best things ever, so i can't blame you
[3:39:58] <%Dakuu75> LOL
[3:40:06] <GarbageQueenEllie> @Gruhunchously As someone who's never even picked up an RE before? Looks like something I'll buy!
[3:40:26] <%Monkeyweed21> dont forget to talk to that one chick
[3:40:34] <%Huntercd> Does kris has a light saber
[3:40:36] <@SoFarFetched> he got them evil eyes going
[3:40:40] <%Ranryu692> oh, THAT Elmo
[3:40:43] <%cylish> vwv
[3:40:50] <%PanicSwytch> Elmo's getting fucked?
[3:41:02] <+shadic7700> Hey chat who do you think would win in a straight fight Revan or the Exile?
[3:41:07] <%Movemeister> Elmo looks like he‚Äôs seen things
[3:41:13] <TrollKing96> @PatStaresAt How do you decide on your party in RPGs?
[3:41:53] <GarbageQueenEllie> @shadic7700 Exile in martial combat, Revan in a Force battle
[3:42:18] <+Dova573> I have to admit I wish there were no party limits
[3:42:18] <%SaiyanShoto> I just go by who I like
[3:42:24] <%Monkeyweed21> Yusuke is best boi
[3:42:34] <%ItsCaptainDisco> Hey @patstaresat ! Happy Friday, how was your week?
[3:42:34] <+Dova573> I wanted the whole yakuza 7 gang on the team at the same time
[3:42:39] <+shadic7700> Hm I‚Äôm bias towards Revan but the whole hole in the force feels like cheats for the exile
[3:42:46] <Broken_Sonex> If there's more than one hot chick, that's my party.
[3:42:57] <+cvp5127> even eri
[3:42:58] <Mattais88> I use whoever's the lowest level to round them off
[3:43:06] <%Too_Much_Nukie> When I play games I usually form an A team and a B team, both being balanced party formations. Then I switch my party between the two teams often to keep things interesting.
[3:43:12] <%Monkeyweed21> I wish Eri was either worse in combat or better in story
[3:43:29] <j___a___c___k___> CHUBA waga naba naga
[3:43:29] <%Deft_Thought> The future has holo-cam girls
[3:43:38] <+Dova573> I still dont know if Eri was even real
[3:43:51] <%Monkeyweed21> She's too good to not use but has no interaction with anyone
[3:43:52] <j___a___c___k___> Chuba na wanga na mitassa
[3:43:53] <%Ranryu692> She was apparently a contest winner
[3:43:56] <GarbageQueenEllie> @Too_Much_Nukie That's what I usually do.
[3:44:00] <lloyddboy> I'LL KILL YOU!
[3:44:03] <%ItsCaptainDisco> I really need to buy Yakuza 7. Is the dub optional? I prefer the Japanese
[3:44:17] <%Dakuu75> lol

[3:44:52] <%Ranryu692> Yakuza 7
[3:44:52] <%ItsCaptainDisco> Great, I didn't want to hear Baka Mitai in English
[3:44:54] <%gksnipa> kotor 2 in a nutshell
[3:45:07] <%Ranryu692> don't use the dub, the original is incredible
[3:45:09] <+Dova573> I so prefer Ichis english Va or his japanese one
[3:45:13] <%baka_sugoi> dub so good in yakuza 7
[3:45:22] <qu3kl41n_the_impure_king> could you imagine that hype shit in one of the movies? one sith electrocutes a whole room of goons
[3:45:24] <+Dova573> over'
