[0:20:44] <%xxinevitablexii> Had a similar deal where I got vacation so I could go out home out of state. Got pre-approved by the store manager and my dept. manager. Dept. manager got pissy cause I submitted the paperwork direct to the office instead of him.
[0:20:44] <%MoralCompassGaming> Let me tell you, 6 years in QA changes a man
[0:20:46] <%SolidusRex> I hope I'm not at my deadend job for much longer, I've been here for two years already

[0:20:49] <%mckraven> @angriestpat I was quitting my job at the pharmacy, cause the boss yelled at me for being 15 mins late cause my dog was dying at the vet down the street. he said he'd "allow" me to quit but I better not be an asshole who didn't do his last two weeks. of course I didn't and my boss called my cellphone every day to tell me how bad of a person I was.

[0:25:22] <%dekkitout> Or did he say 'strong men'
[0:25:23] <cureneckbeard> is granblue the one that has a precure crossover now

[0:25:30] <darcfowler1995> everybody loves tits they're so powerful they could destroy the world
[0:25:31] <%gigglefists> have to leave for now but have an amazing night everyone!
[0:25:31] <Zaphire_Saucypants> I'm not a fan of censorship...at all. Cuz it's an easy means of sliding into thought policing. You start censoring one thing, you open the gate to more censorship.
[0:25:34] <RubberFistFight> When the strawmen are the loudest voices in the room to the point where nobody else is audible, you can't be faulted for only responding to them, basically.
[0:25:34] <%starotter70> @necrocannibal2 Sir, please come with me
[0:25:38] <+Roundelay11> we all like da grindan games here
[0:25:38] <djazo> BUT I LOVE TITS pat
[0:25:39] <%depressed_skeleton> Angriest pat stares at KAKAROT
[0:25:42] <+Whiteowlsmith> it's kinda hard to call a strawman a strawman when that strawman is literally flailing in front of your face screaming it's a real boy
[0:25:42] <deviljhojho_> FUCK YOU

[0:25:51] <%valriot> I think censoring titty is dumb, if it's really petty, or conflicts with theme and narrative. If they censored 2Bs ass, that's a crime
[0:25:52] <%Pookiedaexzile> Lets talk about the real villian here: PERV ASS JAPAN. Stop putting the 12 year olds in bikinis Japan

[0:26:51] <%DesertPenguin> You're playing RE7 again too?
[0:26:53] <RubberFistFight> @valriot it's not "censorship" though. Pat wasn't wrong when he said the word "censorship" has an extremely narrow, specific definition. And you can't fault people for pointing that out - if you want to blame anyone blame the people that coined the term in the first place.
[0:26:54] <%RedMageRebel> its all coming up pathouse
[0:26:54] <%necrocannibal2> what
[0:26:55] <%IMDRanged> Gun Survivor tho

[0:45:10] <Jrocy247> BECAUSE IT'S ANOTHER FE. It's THAT simple
[0:45:10] <$Afterman_> it is though
[0:45:10] <%valriot> At least it's not Ultra Instinct Goku LUL LUL LUL LUL Fuck Fighting Games
[0:45:11] <j0ustar> truth
[0:45:13] <cherrycottontail> this is the first popular fire emblem game, it deserves it
[0:45:13] <%necrocannibal2> how popular is it in Japan, though?
[0:45:14] <%Meidolaon> But it's roster is massive enough LUL
[0:45:14] <%dukenux> FACTS
[0:45:15] <%Sir_stride> BIG FACTS
[0:45:15] <%XeroSigmaPrime> ZELDA DOESNT GET BARELY ANYTHING

[0:45:17] <dreu81> FE isn't pokemane
[0:45:19] <%republicofu> thruth
[0:45:19] <%BallerSwagBro9k> Fire Emblem has 4 good games
[0:45:20] <artificiallynatural> fire emblem is a fast growing nintendo franchises tho
[0:45:20] <$TheSmerdis> Why was he the LAST dlc, after FOUR guests
[0:45:20] <%AncelDeLambert> Pokemon is world wide
[0:45:20] <%DazzlingFuhrer> Byleth was an awful addition.
[0:45:22] <%crimsonharvest> PLUS, like half of those characters are clones
[0:45:23] <%likuuwu> likuuwu subscribed with Twitch Prime. 
[0:45:23] <%trashamn> But its big in japan
[0:45:23] <dredshift> Pokemon is literally the largest media franchise in existence
[0:45:23] <%SvenHolgersson> It's just Japan shilling
[0:45:25] <NaturalGear> yeah, but also, who fucking cares about Smash
[0:45:25] <%evilmagetim> swordman
[0:45:26] <%CommanderSqueaks> Do you mean big in Japan or big in the rest of the World?
[0:45:26] <%Tracazoid> The real shame is that Cuphead is a costume instead of a character.
[0:45:26] <%Engwithan_Elder_God> Preach the TRUTH
[0:45:27] <mrjplays2k9> POKEMON IS THE NUMBER ONE PROPERTY IN THE WORLD RANKED
[0:45:28] <%soraabora> yeah but byleth though
[0:45:28] <%nathandiel> That guy loves Pat
[0:45:29] <dreu81> marth-likes lol
[0:45:30] <%cvp5127> marth marth
[0:45:32] <%Aydarkzero> Marth with fire Kappa
[0:45:32] <%XenomorphicTendencies> The 'but pokemon' argument is really dumb
[0:45:32] <$Afterman_> hoes mad
[0:45:34] <%Sir_stride> THEY SHUNNED HIM FOR HE SPOKE THE TRUTH
[0:45:35] <%skizzuto> technically pokemon has the most representation if you count all the pokeball pokemon
[0:45:35] <marvel877> Pokemon also has a more diverse cast compared to Fire Emblem
[0:45:36] <majima666> i was lucky enough to catch the beggining of the pokemon boom....but meh, i can live without it now
[0:45:37] <ShichiNoBushi> Hector, please.
[0:45:38] <%Meidolaon> Marth Clones are a problem yeah
[0:45:38] <%whiskey_wolfe_> I'm Marth-adjacent
[0:45:39] <%SvenHolgersson> THERE ARE LIKE 5 MARTH CLONES
[0:45:39] <startadevy> fire emblem doesnt just skip forward and tell you HE DEAD GET OVER IT
[0:45:40] <NickCaesar7> Japan tho
[0:45:40] <wannabemoogle> Someone link the Marth meme
[0:45:40] <Solidnick18> they just really want to like FE or something
[0:45:42] <%GabeSweetMan> Never let the salt die!
[0:45:42] <%Pookiedaexzile> Byleth sucks and I now hate FE because of that announcement
[0:45:43] <%bigdumbidiotguy> zfgSpeedFrog zfgSpeedFrog zfgSpeedFrog zfgSpeedFrog zfgSpeedFrog zfgSpeedFrog zfgSpeedFrog zfgSpeedFrog zfgSpeedFrog
[0:45:44] <%Psyramics> Apparently, the latest fire emblems have been pulling Pokemon numbers
[0:45:45] <+NitronStreams> pokemon gets pokeballs
[0:45:45] <%Dementedpenguin> I saw a image of a Fire Emblem cast and though half of them were the same person
[0:45:46] <%SirFancySwank> most reps are shill reps
[0:45:46] <%Aydarkzero> oh yeah it did
[0:45:47] <Jrocy247> Corrin was the MOST hated one
[0:45:47] <majima666> the last one i played was black and white 2
[0:45:47] <%Meidolaon> Chrom actually did upset me
[0:45:47] <%SvenHolgersson> ITS FUCKING RIDICULOUS
[0:45:48] <%goose_attack_almanac> Fates is also garbage
[0:45:48] <%starotter70> Oh yeeeeah
[0:45:50] <shiny_prinny> once i found out it wasn't the last fighter, i wasn't annoyed about it
[0:45:51] <%patriotrenegade> Sakurai just wants to make a FR fighting game
[0:45:51] <Cosairen> Mario has 14 reps Pat you are dumb and also wrong
[0:45:51] <%Meidolaon> But Byleth is fine
[0:45:52] <+TestAnon> FE6 wasn't even out in Japan!
[0:45:54] <%miguelrod777> Sakurai like fire emblem
[0:45:54] <%Mekhet09> Cuphead would have been an amazing as a character.
[0:45:55] <%weissguard> Ah. I see that you too have watch the latest Keef Crew video. LUL
[0:45:55] <%Valdorick> But Smash is the game that Fire Emblem is a spin off of! Of CORUSE they get a lot of characters! After all! Marth comes from Smash apatSmug
[0:45:55] <+Edrem> Put some Advance Wars characters in!
[0:45:55] <%StaceMcGate> I LIKE YOUR ATTITUDE
[0:45:56] <%happyface699> @nathandiel Is he just one of those bullies who secretly loves pat so he makes fun of him
[0:45:56] <mrjplays2k9> hes a mii
[0:45:56] <AnAnonymousGifter> An anonymous user is gifting 1 Tier 1 Subs to AngriestPat's community! 
[0:45:56] <zk_nails> Roy was in Melee before his game came out
[0:45:57] <+chaumiester> But there are tiddies in Fire Emblem
[0:45:57] <AnAnonymousGifter> An anonymous user gifted a Tier 1 sub to RubberFistFight!  
[0:45:57] <%Nordguy> whos corrin
[0:45:57] <%Nobrev> yeah but sakurai loves the series so he gets to pick the characters
[0:45:58] <%hussdogrob> but it's pretty popular in Japan though apatDab
[0:46:01] <marvel877> You read that one twitter post, huh, Pat?
[0:46:01] <%TendrilsTwitch> who the fuck would ACTUALLY want Rex though
[0:46:01] <%patriotrenegade> BLAND
[0:46:01] <%peachy996> Oh yea you sawa that post
[0:46:02] <%evilmagetim> Wasn't Roy in before FE's release in NA?
[0:46:02] <dreu81> so is FE huge in japan?
[0:46:03] <DracaenaLeaf> Pyra is core values :^)
[0:46:05] <%SvenHolgersson> Just keep Ike, Corrin and Byleth
[0:46:06] <%RubberFistFight> Woooaaah
[0:46:08] <%bigdumbidiotguy> zfgToucan
[0:46:08] <%Aydarkzero> all unique though
[0:46:08] <TonberryLives> I can only imagine that Sakurai is a HUGE Fire Emblem mark
[0:46:10] <%crimsonharvest> mario doesnt have 6 mario clones tho
[0:46:12] <oyyzzo> ResidentSleeper
[0:46:13] <dredshift> But would you actually choose Rex over Byleth?
[0:46:14] <+chunkymonkey737> bella donna rubber fist fight
[0:46:14] <%RubberFistFight> @AnAnonymousGifter Thanks for the gift sub!
[0:46:16] <%dukenux> there are other games popular in Japan too
[0:46:18] <%nathandiel> I love pat so I make fun of Paige
[0:46:18] <%天使42199> okay I like fire emblem guys ! you can hate me for it !
[0:46:18] <Johker> The question is is it huger than Pokemon in Japan
[0:46:20] <%cvp5127> should have been dlc 6
[0:46:20] <%DedlokPM> I am only mad because it is a pure nintendo character in a season pass filled with non-nintendo stuff (yes there was Banjo, but I consider that more Rare & Microsoft than Nintendo)
[0:46:21] <trashcansan> @cosairen Mario should also be taken down a peg. no one lives
[0:46:22] <%miguelrod777> The man likes his fire emblem
[0:46:23] <%valriot> Martha, Roytha, Lurtha, Chrortha, Cornbread, Bi-Energy, and Ike
[0:46:23] <Jrocy247> FACTS
[0:46:24] <NickCaesar7> Mario is shit next to Fire Emblem tho
[0:46:24] <%Whiteowlsmith> in fairness though Byleth is a better rep of the series since it's more than just a sword but regardless yeah way too many
[0:46:24] <%Aydarkzero> but Roy's out boy!
[0:46:26] <%happyface699> @rubberfistfight Noice
[0:46:26] <%Agami23> corrin is cool.
[0:46:27] <majindusto> AND ROY
[0:46:27] <%Aeoneth> Fuck off ROy's my Boy
[0:46:27] <%Aydarkzero> our*
[0:46:30] <ZM_Anon> Lumping DK reps, Yoshi, and Wario in with Mario LUL
[0:46:31] <%Pookiedaexzile> We can't have Doom guy because he's too New
[0:46:31] <%michingmallecho> Pokémon is trillions. TRILLIONS
[0:46:32] <%SirFancySwank> true facts
[0:46:33] <%Faustgesicht> 14 reps that at least play different
[0:46:35] <%soraabora> thats fair
[0:46:35] <%CommanderSqueaks> @TonberryLives I think we've gotten to the point where Sakurai is like "Fuck all of you, I'm going to put who I want in. I owe you assholes NOTHING."
[0:46:35] <cureneckbeard> marth's our barth
[0:46:36] <marvel877> Byleth could have easily been Monster Hunter
[0:46:36] <%necrocannibal2> PUT JOEL FROM TLOU IN IT
[0:46:36] <TheHeroAppears> how many goku's though
[0:46:36] <artificiallynatural> if chrom and lucina, being echo characters, weren't there I imagine people would be less mad
[0:46:37] <+ahdurian> BUT ROY. HE'S OUR BOY
[0:46:37] <%XeroSigmaPrime> ZELDA HAS 6 REPS, 3 OF WHICH ARE BASICALLY THE SAME. BUT FE GETS 7?!
[0:46:39] <JackalKing> Nah, fuck Byleth even. Marth and Ike.
[0:46:39] <Terrabyte_The_Terrible> Mario is the most iconic video game franchise of all time
[0:46:40] <%BallerSwagBro9k> If you're happy about BYLETH you're the bad guy LUL
[0:46:40] <thatWaulfyguy> counting in binary tho
[0:46:41] <+quackisalive> As a Corrin and Robin main I disagree
[0:46:42] <%Gogetta159> and those 14 Mario characters are all pretty damn different
[0:46:44] <+loukemia83> Mario and Pokemon Reps have varied playstyles, most of the FE reps are clones of marth
[0:46:44] <deviljhojho_> JUST PUT AGUMON
[0:46:45] <LordSDB> The worst part is they could use so many other unique characters from FE but instead they kept making anoither marth
[0:46:45] <devanmuse> you saw that alpharad video, didn't you?
[0:46:45] <cureneckbeard> IKE'S OUR BIKE
[0:46:46] <%Kenori> this should have been annoucement character number 3
[0:46:47] <%honeyman18> end in a wet fart
[0:46:47] <%bigdumbidiotguy> donkey kong is here baby
[0:46:48] <cherrycottontail> Three Houses is the first one to reach a larger audience, more general audience. Byleth deserves it.
[0:46:48] <%Kenori> instead of 5
[0:46:49] <majindusto> FUCK YOU...ROY IS COOL TOO
[0:46:49] <dreu81> Doom was on the SNES -- hes older then Byleth
[0:46:54] <DrFacilier> Byleth shoulda been added in like...a free update or something
[0:46:56] <%Agami23> roy, ike, robin, corrin, and byleth is the good ones
[0:46:57] <%AncelDeLambert> the idea of a fourth house that CALLS themselves the Fourth House in a game called Three Houses is nonsensical to me
[0:46:59] <%RubberFistFight> @AngriestPat I'M SUBBED NOW STREAMER YOU BETTER DANCE FOR ME YOU TINY FRENCH CANADIAN DANCING MONKEY Kappa
[0:47:01] <%Meidolaon> Corrin is a loser but at least his moveset's unique
[0:47:01] <trashcansan> @xerosigmaprime zelda can go away too lol
[0:47:02] <richmon_> pat! you sombababish!
[0:47:03] <Quietshun13> Am happy
[0:47:03] <%hussdogrob> but hey we have six more coming and 7 more after that so hurrah for 3 more FE characters after byleth
[0:47:05] <dredshift> Fire Emblem was getting its shit in before its game came out from the start. Roy was in Melee before his game was out in Japan.
[0:47:05] <%DazzlingFuhrer> Byleth doesn't deserve anything, they're human cardboard.

[0:47:09] <%happyface699> @rubberfistfight now your dick is huge
[0:47:09] <DeltascapeV4> Did you mention that Byleth is a very bland and boring character?
[0:47:11] <%michingmallecho> ENOUGH SWORD CHARACTERS
[0:47:12] <%kewlmyc> Roy sucks. Fuck off Chat
[0:47:12] <%GabeSweetMan> HERE COMES MONGO

[0:47:16] <%cdrom321> Cheer100 I didn't mean to say "try again" in my sub message. With all of this RE you're doing, do you have a plan for RE4 like difficulty, costume, challenge run, etc?
[0:47:16] <+NitronStreams> the series is called "smash BROS" of course theres gonna be "MARIO BROS" characters
[0:47:16] <Haruharuharuko> Byleth doesn’t deserve anything but the trash watTrashcan

[0:47:53] <%bigdumbidiotguy> apatPorgmo
[0:47:53] <FatherGreyBeard> Personally I'm excited for Byleth but I think it would have better to have had them in Pass 2
[0:47:54] <majima666> i wont knock the impact they had on the industry though
[0:47:54] <%Meidolaon> Byleth's a weirdo dork
[0:48:00] <%天使42199> @meidolaon you think the people talking shit would actually bother to play 3h though?
[0:48:03] <%DazzlingFuhrer> The only people calling Byleth cardboard as the ones who actually played Three Houses.
[0:48:05] <%TrueSpartan14> @AngriestPat Just make Marth, Roy, Lucina, and Chrom like the Dragon Quest hero instead of havig their own character slots and play style differences
[0:48:05] <%depressed_skeleton> Chaos reigns

[0:54:06] <%XeroSigmaPrime> RE4 knife is only okay with certain bosses
[0:54:10] <%RubberFistFight> @AngriestPat I too feel the same about myself. Retail destroyed what little patience for people I had, as well as making me view basically every behaviour in an increasingly cynical light, especially if it's from a "customer". It's also made me much more likely to kick up a stink AS a customer. As well as the nightmares. Yes, I have nightmares about my time in retail. It fucking. SUCKS.
[0:54:10] <%patriotrenegade> Two years of retail. My smile: gone. My optimism: irreparably damaged.

[1:01:24] <%depressed_skeleton> Kakarot is ok
[1:01:27] <%RubberFistFight> Fun Fact: The actor Rowan Atkinson ALSO has a speech impediment, largely focusing around "hard consonants" like P and B. That is why he pronounces the word "Bob" a little... idiosyncratically.
[1:01:27] <%humbelpie> Pat if you ever come to PAX East one of these days i know a good place that makes legit poutine
[1:01:29] <%dukenux> it doesnt look that bad

[1:01:39] <Run44forrest> kakarot PepeLaugh
[1:01:42] <%AncelDeLambert> it's almost like DBZ ruined everything
[1:01:42] <artificiallynatural> it's like a rebranded xenoverse to me
[1:01:43] <rytisone> If you're a massive dbz fan, it is for you

[1:01:52] <%NekoUrabe> I'm big bored of the story
[1:01:53] <%Dementedpenguin> Based on Plague's tweet, the only thing I know about the game is that Launch is in it.

[1:14:23] <%scaryboisupreme> Speaking of call centers, i just got a job in one

[1:14:25] <%Solidnick18> FeelsGoodMan
[1:14:25] <%AncelDeLambert> yes
[1:14:25] <mrjplays2k9> can cats get AIDS

[1:14:28] <%Valdorick> In... theory, yeah.
[1:14:29] <%Taisuru> Probably
[1:14:30] <Man_in_the_Red> probably
[1:14:30] <%xxinevitablexii> Feline AIDS
[1:14:33] <+mmack093> They can get AIDS
[1:14:36] <$Afterman_> FIV?
[1:14:36] <%draugrix> apatBig pp
[1:14:37] <%天使42199> @man_in_the_red ah did it get out that they are cutting half their roster out or something?
[1:14:39] <Fujiwara_92> hearing AIDS?
[1:14:43] <%AncelDeLambert> @AngriestPat if dogs can get wheelchairs, cat's can get hearing aids
[1:14:43] <JetpackMcQuack> Normal people do that
[1:14:45] <%valriot> Rich Evans: AAAAAAAAIDS
[1:14:48] <TheHeroAppears> cyborg elmo up
[1:14:50] <%TheMattman1313> They just freak out when they turn and suddenly see you. It's cute
[1:14:50] <TheTrueZyozz> @Run44forrest, I'll take your place.
[1:14:51] <$Afterman_> cats can get around blind yea
[1:14:51] <%starotter70> How little difference it can make sometimes
[1:14:55] <FatherGreyBeard> smell is strong
[1:14:56] <wannabemoogle> they have the smell
[1:14:57] <+TDotGoat> as long as stairs aren't involved :(
[1:14:58] <%soraabora> yeah i knew a blind dog, that dude could go anywhere
[1:14:58] <%bluebiscuit94> I've seen a blind dog be perfectly fine in his home, so yea
[1:15:00] <%DesertPenguin> They'll figure it out again, just takes a few weeks
[1:15:02] <%SvenHolgersson> Pets aren't pussies like people they'll manage
[1:15:04] <%happyface699> They can still kill
[1:15:05] <%necrocannibal2> @valriot wow, Rich, you held that AIDS longer than Magic Johnson!
[1:15:05] <%JJCheeker> AAAAAAAAAIIIDS? prerecRich
[1:15:05] <TheHeroAppears> wait can he get scream aids instead
[1:15:06] <+CatastropheCorvid> Call centres ARE better than retail, because I can hang up on those motherfuckers. It's recorded, but "accidents" still happen.
[1:15:08] <%RubberFistFight> I wouldn't be able to handle a cat that is deaf and blind. I'd be non-stop crying.
[1:15:09] <%xxinevitablexii> Y'all seen that Sphinx cat with no eyes?
[1:15:10] <%Aleate> Wait but they are deaf. why would the furniture... ah fuck it
[1:15:11] <eleveneighteen> i think people are impressed how well a smart cat or dog that is blind and deaf manage
[1:15:13] <+Zutrax> I have a blind cat and she is very capable, but now you have me freaked out she is going to go deaf as well.
[1:15:20] <+ThePayphone> well when my cat got around 20 years old she pissed on a pile of change on my floor instead of her litterbox so
[1:15:20] <%startadevy> humans live the auto immune disease with the help of drugs
[1:15:21] <%DesertPenguin> lol
[1:15:22] <youlookokgetin> cats memorize their surroundings, if you move a thing away you can see them still going around it for a while
[1:15:23] <Mister_McDerp> yeah my dog still knew how to navigate the house when she lost her sight
[1:15:23] <+Jasuchin> A family friend of mine has a hearing impaired dog. She's fine, but she barks constantly!
[1:15:26] <Man_in_the_Red> @angel42199 the game has 11 characters but they already confirmed 2 seasons of DLC, so it means they'll do what Namco does and just pretending they arent finished
[1:15:34] <%SvenHolgersson> S U H
[1:15:34] <deviljhojho_> suh
[1:15:35] <+D00msDayDan> i wonder if you could teach a dog to echolocate with barks
[1:15:37] <%TheMattman1313> Max every stat, watch the game fall apart
[1:15:40] <deviljhojho_> NEVER BACK DOWN
[1:15:40] <%Monkeyweed21> Mr Ambrosius Costeau
[1:15:42] <%Solidnick18> don't
[1:15:49] <%Taisuru> You have to play it pat cmon
[1:15:50] <%Aydarkzero> re6 is a decent game just not a good re game

[1:33:58] <JayEarly> Wesker is weirdly a bro in the Chris path until he takes the mask off
[1:33:59] <%Darastrix> I find it interesting that out of all of the RE games, Claire and Jill never have any interactions with each other.
[1:34:00] <%logoth_> I'll take care of *this*

[1:40:29] <FirearmsInstructor> @AngriestPat I love how you're saying the original lines and not the REmake ones. <3
[1:40:29] <+Ploobie> shrink barry down a couple of feet, take hair from his head and put it on his face instead, and you have Pat.
[1:40:29] <%SvenHolgersson> THANKS DAD
[1:40:29] <JayEarly> MASTER OF UNLOCKING
[1:40:29] <djazo> @angriestpat this game made the og unplayable LUL
[1:40:31] <@mothmandraws> now I must sleep night chat, be good
[1:40:31] <Stillchr> Barry is the best RE character
[1:40:34] <studleydoorite> why did they make the writing worse
[1:40:38] <%ElenaManetta> These camera angles are cool because they have to achieve them with the existing environment and not "cheat" them by manipulating props for single shots like you normally would
[1:40:38] <%MayorRev> @angriestpat there's a mod that replaces the voices here with the classic ones
[1:40:39] <%Solidnick18> shits rusty
[1:40:39] <%walternatorz> how am I supposed to know that Jill is a master of unlocking now?
[1:40:40] <FirearmsInstructor> @AngriestPat It makes me feel less crazy
[1:40:41] <%valriot> Never meet up in the hall after

[1:41:04] <kingbaconcrispy> Pat, do the stair skating!
[1:41:05] <ralphfromdk> Ho´nest question... Did they use amateur voiceactors again? Or is it just bad writing
[1:41:07] <+Ploobie> Lisa it's your birthday. Happy Birthday, Lisa.
[1:41:07] <%MayorRev> is that a DLC door? @angriestpat
[1:41:09] <%redrins> hello this is lockpickingjill today we got this master lock with a major security flaw

[1:41:10] <%godzookylives> Lisa needs Braces!
[1:41:11] <majima666> lisa was going to be in the original re1
[1:41:12] <%lethallunacyx> Sounded like Peach
[1:41:14] <%RedMageRebel> lisa is still the spookiest they ever got to me
[1:41:15] <%happyface699> MU FUTU WIFE
[1:41:16] <%manwithboxonhead> SHUT UP L***
[1:41:16] <KaijuVania> you kinda look like Barry Pat
[1:41:18] <%PrettyThickandStrongDyck> And to think Wesker to finished her off
[1:41:18] <mrjplays2k9> @AngriestPat Gonna one shot this?
[1:41:21] <+AXL808> Why chose to play RE 1 and RE Remake?
[1:41:22] <+Ploobie> DENTAL PLAN
[1:41:26] <Kemmybelle> spooky doodTerror
[1:41:26] <%Aydarkzero> this room looks familiar Kappa
[1:41:32] <%DonatelloJose> @reonome I literally got up to my computer to type that. beat me to it
[1:41:34] <%Erimos> It's like you're walking around in a painting.
[1:41:35] <reddpop_> this game still looks SO GOOD
[1:41:36] <%ElenaManetta> This isn't a 3D environment?
[1:41:38] <%MoralCompassGaming> agreed, it's how i'm making my game actually
[1:41:39] <%hawk_rush> the shadows are really nice
[1:41:41] <+mmack093> but REmake doesn't have ALFERD ASHFORD DOES IT?!
[1:41:43] <%ElenaManetta> I thought it was with really great textures
[1:41:46] <TalisKanju> It isn't the same room
[1:41:47] <ittla> this game makes a real compelling case for pre-rendered backgrounds and i'd really love to see something bring them back
[1:41:48] <thetruenicster> Imagine Getting The Map Here
[1:41:49] <+Ghostfaceninja53534> dont forget tank controls doodWesker
[1:41:50] <%Aydarkzero> @AXL808 to show the difference a good remake can do also bad voice acting
[1:41:51] <djazo> 160p BOYZ
[1:41:54] <%happyface699> This game ripped off cvx am I right har har
[1:41:57] <%theotherkristian> If they remake 4, would you prefer if they made the other failed version of the game @angriestpat ?
[1:42:00] <NaturalGear> Imagine if FF didn't abandon pre-rendered backgrounds after IX Kreygasm
[1:42:01] <RunningNGunning> @ralphfromdk In the original game? Bad actors + Bad voice direction from the game's creators
[1:42:06] <%radda343> when babby me first saw that map my mind was fuckin BLOWN
[1:42:07] <%ospreyworks> Using the texture mods?
[1:42:07] <%rumtumtugnutz> ALFERD
[1:42:11] <+dustingunn> wow this gamecube game rerendered in 1080p looks better than a dreamcast game?
[1:42:13] <%天使42199> @elenamanetta it's kinda like a 3d environment that just uses pictures for everything
[1:42:14] <TalisKanju> This room is in Raccoon City, where the room in CVX is in Antarctica
[1:42:14] <%SolverCODO> Skelmo looks particularly beautiful today
[1:42:16] <dreu81> darth vader ripped off robocop like this ripped off cvx
[1:42:19] <%JJCheeker> You should use the knife
[1:42:19] <FirearmsInstructor> All of you stupid assholes who are making me remember that simpsons episode are a bunch of stupid jerks. LUL Get out of my head, god damnit. RPGAyaya
[1:42:19] <$RealThiele> stab a bitch to run
[1:42:25] <+BubbaRands> Zambino
[1:42:25] <%bigdumbidiotguy> @angriestpat I heard if u knife the zombie in this room 69 times he will get up and do the fartnite dance
[1:42:33] <dreu81> LUL
[1:42:33] <+D00msDayDan> @dreu81 that's a powerful take
[1:42:34] <%Aydarkzero> monkaS
[1:42:35] <%valriot> @angriestpat Isn't the new RE engine taking photos of real life objects and scanning them basically an evolution of prerendering backgrounds?
[1:42:36] <+Th3SmartAlec> Oh my goooooood
[1:42:37] <%natebud> Look at this tutorial room
[1:42:37] <rytisone> That zombie is huge
[1:42:38] <%peachy996> I hate this guy, He always grabs me
[1:42:38] <warmnoid> ZOMBO
[1:42:39] <ralphfromdk> RunningNGunning Yeah, that i know, it was so bad, but it was the 90's. But this... holy fuck it's still so bad
[1:42:40] <TalisKanju> Best scene in the game coming up
[1:42:41] <%Aydarkzero> Jill c'mon!
[1:42:42] <thetruenicster> wait, I thought it automatically used the defensive item?
[1:42:43] <%starotter70> Aaaaaaaaah
[1:42:44] <+Grayhammatter> a monster!
[1:42:45] <DragonSpooker> I played and beat this for the first time a few months ago, I absolutely loved it
[1:42:45] <%happyface699> Zambambo
[1:42:47] <JayEarly> It’s great that they could just pump all that power into the character models
[1:42:48] <%RedMageRebel> SCURRY ZAMBI
[1:42:50] <%TinyLittleDancer> Pocket Shank TM
[1:42:51] <%Solidnick18> MONSTERS

[1:42:57] <%natebud> you solved the puzzle
[1:42:58] <+Th3SmartAlec> THEY GOT MY EYE
[1:42:58] <%bigdumbidiotguy> look out it's a monster!
[1:42:58] <$RealThiele> red head inc
[1:42:58] <dreu81> @D00msDayDan Indeed LUL
[1:43:00] <%peachy996> It's tough to escape him
[1:43:02] <%Laecerelius> Doesn't even kill it
[1:43:04] <%ElenaManetta> Thinking back, these are really advanced spooks for a PS1 game. Going around the corner and it's secretly a "cutscene"
[1:43:07] <SheefEatsBeef> wat
[1:43:09] <%trueherobappo> @AngriestPat How would you feel about a CVX Remake using the RE engine?
[1:43:10] <AntChodeny> the legend of the gameboy sp blue edition
[1:43:12] <%peachy996> without using the dagger
[1:43:13] <+AcrutaLao> That maniac! WHY'D SHE STAB ME
[1:43:17] <+TheBitingIrish> >Not blocking him in with the dresser
[1:43:18] <mrjplays2k9> 2 locked doors, what a master of unlocking
[1:43:18] <%ospreyworks> He using the HD texture pack?
[1:43:19] <FatherGreyBeard> that corner cutscene is fantastic
[1:43:19] <+Machomanohyeeaa> You have to be a pro to dodge this guy....which I am
[1:43:21] <kingbaconcrispy> Pat you can bait zombies.
[1:43:22] <+Th3SmartAlec> LUL
[1:43:24] <+Machomanohyeeaa> :)
[1:43:24] <%theotherkristian> If Capcom was forced to remake 4, Gun to your head style, should they change the game, RE 2 style?
[1:43:25] <%RedMageRebel> no for real I like how this and RE2 Remake handle zambies. They're actually kind of scary
[1:43:27] <%valriot> Didn't push the box back lul
[1:43:29] <myriad_truth> I want a Veronica REmake!!!
[1:43:31] <%manwithboxonhead> The Lockpick opens some doors...

[1:44:17] <%Solidnick18> who
[1:44:18] <kingbaconcrispy> Remake is stil spoopy
[1:44:18] <+Machomanohyeeaa> @grayhammatter there gonna be wishing they’re did for lil bit before tho
[1:44:19] <%Erimos> and the lightning Kreygasm
[1:44:19] <%Laecerelius> T-Posing zombies asserting dominance
[1:44:19] <%Sausious> wait til he becomes a Crimson Head
[1:44:20] <mrjplays2k9> me looking in the fridge at 3am
[1:44:20] <%ospreyworks> @angel42199 But is he using the fan made one with the machine learning updated backgrounds?
[1:44:21] <%valriot> spok
[1:44:22] <%Aydarkzero> re2r zombies don't really do that they have better vision
[1:44:23] <TalisKanju> Shoot it in the head
[1:44:23] <+unclekulikov> What's the frequency, Kenneth?
[1:44:25] <rytisone> play some moonlight sonata to make it less spooky
[1:44:26] <Fien111> @AngriestPat Did you have trouble getting this game to play nice with resolutions? Cause I literally had to refund it because absolute no resolution fit my standard 720 screen
[1:44:29] <%GabeSweetMan> Just have *something standing there* for apatBig SPOOKS
[1:44:31] <%necrocannibal2> this game is so good wtf
[1:44:31] <MachineHead9> just avoid him
[1:44:31] <+Grayhammatter> he's just standing there, menacingly monkaS
[1:44:35] <%ElenaManetta> KENNETH
[1:44:35] <outis94> hes holding his dick
[1:44:39] <%Faustgesicht> Kenneth died like a bitch
[1:44:43] <%ElenaManetta> they killed kenny :(
[1:44:44] <%natebud> he died doing what he loved
[1:44:44] <%godzookylives> You dont get to see that shit for a long time
[1:44:45] <%RedMageRebel> the remakes the only ones to get zombies right. they're overused, but they're legitimately scary when done well
[1:44:45] <%peachy996> This Hallway is rough when Forest is in it
[1:44:46] <majima666> and for some reason the vhs tape doesnt take up a spot in your inventory, like a fucking KEY does
[1:44:47] <%valriot> big porns tape
[1:44:47] <%manwithboxonhead> Now lets not watch this VHS until the near end of the game.
[1:44:47] <%necrocannibal2> UGH
[1:44:47] <ralphfromdk> theotherkristian That would actually be really nice. The whole tank controls in RE4 feels worse and worse everytime I replay it. Game is still great, but it feels stiff
[1:44:48] <%GabeSweetMan> Those shadows are AWESOME
[1:44:48] <$RealThiele> 2 bangbang shooty refill juice

[1:44:53] <DracaenaLeaf> Boob jiggle
[1:44:53] <Kemmybelle> same aura as PT Lisa standing a the end of the hall.
[1:44:55] <ittla> if resi didnt make its comeback with 7 and 2 this is where you would say "remember when resi was scary????"
[1:44:55] <djazo> it.s almost as if this game is a masterpiece LUL
[1:44:56] <MurlinDurl> @Fien111 there is some kind of upscale mod for textures and stuff for PC might need that
[1:44:57] <+Ghostfaceninja53534> it may look like hes just staring at the wall but he is actually deep in thought Kappa
[1:44:58] <rytisone> nah, this one
[1:44:58] <SheefEatsBeef> you're right, those two are gorgeous

[1:45:08] <%heroicspiritavenger> This is the room with the Mysterious Disappearing Corpse
[1:45:11] <%ElenaManetta> is it because jill is a scrub
[1:45:17] <%天使42199> @johnnymedia sounds really bad I mean. need a gpu with more power for 4k
[1:45:18] <%Aydarkzero> i saw a video on that exact corpse Kappa
[1:45:20] <%sporeian94> JILL YOU WILL FUCK MY SISTER!

[1:46:14] <$RealThiele> crows, dogs, spiders, and plants 10/10
[1:46:15] <+dustingunn> this game has a ton of low-res backgrounds outside of the mansion unfortunately
[1:46:16] <%Sausious> i love this hallway bc you can see the enemies coming in the mirroras
[1:46:18] <+Alasdair89> !uptime
[1:46:18] <@Moobot> I've been playing this game for how long? Oh only 1h 46m.
[1:46:20] <FirearmsInstructor> @MyNameIsRasus notkohWave
[1:46:22] <%Aydarkzero> @natebud it must always be ridiculed
[1:46:23] <%NovaKnightmare> fatty zombie
[1:46:23] <%ElenaManetta> FUCK look at that room
[1:46:26] <%marsproject> Oh shit how long has the stream been going?!
[1:46:26] <MurlinDurl> until hes not Kappa
[1:46:28] <FatherGreyBeard> these are good noises
[1:46:29] <%Laecerelius> Fat zombie wants that ass
[1:46:31] <%manwithboxonhead> Watch out
[1:46:33] <timblenaut> the A R R O W
[1:46:34] <%ElenaManetta> i don't remember this HD mod looking so cool
[1:46:36] <Fujiwara_92> STAND ARROW
[1:46:38] <%Solidnick18> use it to get a stand
[1:46:40] <%Aydarkzero> i love that mirror placement btw
[1:46:40] <+Kaiserzelcor> Pat, what makes the original RE games scarier. The controls or the camera angles. IMO it's the camera.
[1:46:41] <MachineHead9> Nice
[1:46:42] <$lutefiiisk> crimsonheads
[1:46:45] <Ner234> @marsproject Not long. Pat spent an hour reading subs
[1:46:45] <%bevyrage> goddamn
[1:46:47] <%bigdumbidiotguy> I'm so scared rn
[1:46:51] <%Erimos> There's a mod that replaces the dialogue with the original 1996 voice acting. I much prefer it.
[1:46:51] <%NovaKnightmare> isnt the first crimsonhead in that room?
[1:46:52] <s1rcuit> mad jukes
[1:46:53] <%RubberFistFight> MRÜÜÜ
[1:46:54] <%RedMageRebel> I dont know how it is with cops, but when I was in basic you always maneuvered with weapon down. Less likely to smack yourself in the face if you fall/if you fall and pull the trigger by accident, hitting your foot is better than your face
[1:46:55] <%theotherkristian> Magazine pickup make way more realistic sense
[1:46:56] <%goose_attack_almanac> Maste rof Unlocking
[1:47:00] <MurlinDurl> if you kill these do they come back as crimsons still
[1:47:01] <%peachy996> I love dodging zombies
[1:47:04] <%manwithboxonhead> @NovaKnightmare Yes.
[1:47:06] <%peachy996> This hallway!
[1:47:07] <%marsproject> Ah ok thank god, as long as I don't miss Jill Sandwich i'm good
[1:47:09] <+JJAllDay> do knives stack?
[1:47:11] <JayEarly> @murlindurl yep
[1:47:13] <%Aydarkzero> @NovaKnightmare i think not until you run into the story crimoson first
[1:47:13] <FirearmsInstructor> @bigdumbidiotguy shut up you big, dumb idiot D: stop being scared!
[1:47:16] <%necrocannibal2> CRIMSON HEADS ARE ASSHOLES
[1:47:17] <%necrocannibal2> GOD
[1:47:18] <%Theastrica> the sound design is giving me the spooks
[1:47:20] <%天使42199> @johnnymedia A lot of it depends on what types of games and what graphics settings you want on them. Even an rtx 2080ti will struggle to do 60fps on ultra for big triple a games. If you're willing to settle for high or less maybe get an rtx 2070 super or something
[1:47:21] <+TheBitingIrish> @JJAllDay believe so
[1:47:23] <%godzookylives> music is so great
[1:47:23] <%peachy996> I can't view some of these hallways the same after one dangerous zombie
[1:47:24] <rytisone> vnadalism
[1:47:29] <Ran196> RE-DS was quite fun
[1:47:34] <%ospreyworks> Is there a mod that gives Chris and Barry jiggle physics?
[1:47:34] <%bigdumbidiotguy> that vampire is the chef
[1:47:36] <Ner234> Fuck that statur
[1:47:42] <%ElenaManetta> It nailed the feeling of "fuck this mansion i want to get out i feel trapped"
[1:47:42] <FirearmsInstructor> @bigdumbidiotguy (I love the user name) RPGAyaya
[1:47:48] <majima666> barry bum jiggle physics mod
[1:47:50] <$RealThiele> they love oil
[1:47:51] <%starotter70> I love the save room theme in this
[1:47:53] <oyyzzo> oh shoot u started
[1:47:54] <%ElenaManetta> Every room and hallway makes you feel tiny and trapped
[1:47:58] <SheefEatsBeef> i wish i was this knowledgeable about any game series
[1:48:04] <%Ranger747> this might be my favorite save room theme
[1:48:06] <FirearmsInstructor> @majima666 wat notkohDerp

[1:48:23] <%IMDRanged> They ruined a painting to put a door there.
[1:48:23] <%ElenaManetta> I was looking at the immaculate door to even notice the moths
[1:48:26] <%peachy996> These two disappear after you kill them
[1:48:31] <bananawarrior1> this remake is so good man
[1:48:31] <%RedMageRebel> oh was that a slightly tilted angle I saw?
[1:48:33] <%Shadowpint> REmake has the best zombie noises
[1:48:33] <JayEarly> Chris only gets SIX inventory slots it’s a nightmare
[1:48:34] <%Erimos> That angle monkaS
[1:48:35] <mrjplays2k9> thicc boy

[1:49:00] <%Ranger747> good sounds
[1:49:04] <majima666> cvx could have looked half decent if it was pre-rendered instead of full 3d
[1:49:04] <+K2YP70C0CK> atpTryAiming atpTryAiming atpTryAiming
[1:49:05] <KaijuVania> Castlevania Dracula X?

[1:49:09] <%chiluzza> thats such a good angle
[1:49:12] <mrjplays2k9> cause they bitches
[1:49:12] <%JJCheeker> They disappear
[1:49:14] <%PauliusMaximus> they dont go crimson either
[1:49:14] <majima666> but i suppose they wanted to test out the dreamcast
[1:49:15] <%Agami23> if you're on the steps the zombambos cant hurt you.
[1:49:16] <%dheng1> i love how they expanded stuff from the og re1
[1:49:19] <cant_pick_a_name> they disappear lol
[1:49:20] <%JJCheeker> If I remember right
[1:49:20] <%RedMageRebel> god we need more fixed angle games, I love a game having cinematography outside of cutscenes
[1:49:22] <valke___> (unless you're playing real survival)
[1:49:22] <%necrocannibal2> is Pat playing with tank controls or the modern one?
[1:49:24] <%ElenaManetta> Just like real guns
[1:49:24] <ittla> also gotta mention that this game's sound is amazing
[1:49:25] <Peculiar_Pangolin> These two don't come back as crimson heads
[1:49:28] <%bigdumbidiotguy> they're going to come back as Fuchsia Feet
[1:49:28] <+dustingunn> cvx looked better than half decent
[1:49:28] <MurlinDurl> tank controls
[1:49:29] <%ElenaManetta> Real life has auto aim
[1:49:30] <%natebud> textbook
[1:49:36] <%bevyrage> these are definitely tank controls
[1:49:37] <FirearmsInstructor> @AngriestPat Knives single use? Non-recoverable like RE2R?
[1:49:40] <%JJCheeker> I think I usually kill them
[1:49:41] <+TheBitingIrish> Shame crimson heads were never in any other games
[1:49:41] <Zaphire_Saucypants> shame they didn't land RIGHT on top of each other
[1:49:42] <%Quigsies> Do the older RE's not have a reload button?
[1:49:46] <%necrocannibal2> IT'S SO GOOD
[1:49:47] <+Ghostfaceninja53534> did you even need toask?
[1:49:47] <%RedMageRebel> DUTCH ANGLE YEAH

[1:49:56] <oyyzzo> this shit looks spoopy
[1:49:56] <%ElenaManetta> I want an indie game that uses this camera and background work
[1:49:57] <%radda343> pat put your dick away

[1:50:00] <rytisone> hello nosferatu
[1:50:00] <%dheng1> i agree bascially porn for re vets

[1:50:47] <+Ghostfaceninja53534> just think of the person/people who set all this shit up.... like wtf
[1:50:47] <%bigdumbidiotguy> do you get a magic wand in this game
[1:50:55] <%Mekhet09> Why is that fire still on.
[1:50:58] <%RubberFistFight> @foreverN2dust IT'S supermarket's own brand cola.
[1:50:59] <$ultimatetotoro> hey i remember that dungeon
[1:51:00] <%heroicspiritavenger> @FirearmsInstructor There's two kinds of knives in REmake 1, a defensive knife that is a 1 time use and it's gone. As well as a combat knife, that is infinite use as a slashing weapon.
[1:51:00] <cant_pick_a_name> if you mash the run button while moving up and down stairs you move really fast
[1:51:00] <TalisKanju> Death Masks or Crests?
[1:51:00] <%bluebiscuit94> Man the difference in your engagement between this and CVX is night and day, I'm glad I was there for it
[1:51:03] <%SvenHolgersson> It's alrighttttttt
[1:51:04] <mrjplays2k9> mrrrrr
[1:51:05] <dreu81> the sword key, but it replaces your knife and you stab zombies with it and unlock doors with your knife
[1:51:08] <Ner234> Meow
[1:51:09] <$ultimatetotoro> screw that place it's super scary
[1:51:09] <%godzookylives> George Trevor was a weird dude
[1:51:12] <MSN04_Sazabi> Any CVX apologists in chat left? Didn't think so LUL
[1:51:13] <%necrocannibal2> @AngriestPat you playing with tank controls?
[1:51:13] <+K2YP70C0CK> ScaredyCat
[1:51:13] <djazo> FUCK I WANT TO PLAY IT AGAIN
[1:51:14] <ralphfromdk> bigdumbidiotguy She has one already, it kills things from far away
[1:51:14] <NaturalGear> Elmo likes CVX
[1:51:19] <FirearmsInstructor> @heroicspiritavenger Thanks again. :)
[1:51:22] <%D33TR> but steve is the greatest character
[1:51:24] <+swaggopotamus> This game makes me tense as fuck.
[1:51:26] <majima666> elmo is more of a silent hill fanboy
[1:51:27] <foreverN2dust> @RubberFistFight rooWut
[1:51:28] <%dukenux> its giving me a whiplash
[1:51:28] <%happyface699> It’s really good
[1:51:28] <$RealThiele> cocaine
[1:51:30] <%peachy996> It's almost as if this is a good game
[1:51:32] <%Aydarkzero> i wonder if this game did get remade if they would just let you switch between tank controls and re2/3r controls
[1:51:33] <%draugrix> Elmo likes GUN SURVIVOR
[1:51:34] <FirearmsInstructor> @heroicspiritavenger 1 time use = dagger, I think, right?
[1:51:35] <TheIronBrass> I played this game for the first time a month ago, fucking amazing
[1:51:36] <reddpop_> this is honestly one of the best games ever made, and im a silent hill fanboy
[1:51:38] <+Kaiserzelcor> They aren't good
[1:51:39] <+SlappyMeats> what is this lame video game that doesn't even take place in Antarctica?!

[1:51:55] <%RedMageRebel> I actually like tank controls in RE4, it makes it part of the strategy
[1:51:56] <MurlinDurl> BIG CHEATS
[1:51:59] <%Aydarkzero> Jill at MAX MOBILITY
[1:52:00] <+AXL808> you become invincible

[1:52:03] <%Dakuu75> what?
[1:52:04] <Quietshun13> I play alternate lol
[1:52:05] <%Shadowpint> It's really not that busted
[1:52:05] <+Grayhammatter> those are basically cheats

[1:52:07] <%kujofire990> DAYTONA
[1:52:08] <%Engwithan_Elder_God> Tank controls are great.
[1:52:08] <%JJCheeker> Dodging zombies is a piece of cake
[1:52:08] <%thackattack00> it makes the game good
[1:52:09] <+Kaiserzelcor> I played it on alternate :dab:
[1:52:09] <%maskofmichael> CVX can suck a dick, REmake is the dick you suck
[1:52:09] <%peachy996> You move like a BB character

[1:52:10] <%RubberFistFight> Bad take time: I can't stand tank controls, vastly prefer the other method.
[1:52:11] <cant_pick_a_name> it's so easy to dodge zombies with those controls
[1:52:11] <KaseKaizer> so tank controls are supposed to be bad?
[1:52:12] <+dustingunn> anyone bashing CV's graphics is probably really young or ignorant of games around 2000

[1:52:18] <MurlinDurl> ok more than mouse aim in RE4 i dunno b ro
[1:52:19] <%StaceMcGate> better control = cheating
[1:52:20] <MachineHead9> it's to help the new players who never played a RE game before LUL
[1:52:23] <%hawk_rush> eh, I disagree
[1:52:23] <@commanderclaw> Nah, the Wiimote RE4 has zero challenge
[1:52:24] <%JJCheeker> It's great for speedruns

[1:52:32] <%Erimos> Smart design.
[1:52:33] <%Jane_Lo> @Aydarkzero nah, because then it would be in third person by default an i doubt they are going to make 3d with these angles
[1:52:34] <%SilverFaustX> good control = cheat
[1:52:41] <FirearmsInstructor> @heroicspiritavenger Like if you defense dagger then shotgun their head off?
[1:52:41] <%heroicspiritavenger> @FirearmsInstructor So, depending on how things go, you can theoretically reuse defensive daggers
[1:52:42] <+professormorrigan> Well the game was made with tank-controls in mind. You're kinda cheating yourself with alernate.
[1:52:44] <+Th3SmartAlec> re-re-remix
[1:52:45] <%bigdumbidiotguy> when will u play Alpha Chimp @angriestpat
[1:52:46] <%Aydarkzero> @Jane_Lo that's fair i suppose

[1:55:06] <%rufus2k2> big bad STARS agent puking her guts out
[1:55:06] <%hawk_rush> it would look really good for an indie game
[1:55:06] <bananawarrior1> women with boots are hot
[1:55:07] <%radda343> the animation's not super great though, needs more mocap
[1:55:07] <%GabeSweetMan> Did she vomit or kiss the toilet?
[1:55:07] <%hawk_rush> todya
[1:55:07] <%Laecerelius> Else she'd have to puke into her shirt
[1:55:07] <%SilverFaustX> this is a remaster of a remaster
[1:55:08] <+SlappyMeats> jill do a barf
[1:55:08] <$JohnnyMedia> "How embarrasing, you caught me in the ba- OH FUCK"

[1:55:11] <%chiluzza> thats considerate of jill to puke in a toilet in this sketchy as fuck mansion
[1:55:12] <%MayorRev> ahh I'm just messing with ya pat
[1:55:13] <TalisKanju> I think the comparison between CVX and RE4 is the crazy thing
[1:55:14] <+Th3SmartAlec> @Sora20030c They'll be mods
[1:55:14] <+dayz1003> @ElenaManetta because you let your guard down in the bathroom
[1:55:15] <%JJCheeker> I mean I cant imagine how that smells
[1:55:16] <%Quigsies> Aw the toilet doesn't work so the pukes just sitting there
[1:55:16] <MyNameIsRasus> hope that isn't chris' puke
[1:55:17] <%happyface699> This game looks better than most modern games
[1:55:18] <%MayorRev> this game looks good
[1:55:20] <ThisGamingDragon> At least Jill looks like Jill remotely in the remake, which is more than I can say for Claire.
[1:55:21] <majima666> some games from the early 00's have aged REALLY well
[1:55:22] <%ElenaManetta> i let my guard down in EVERY room of my house
[1:55:24] <Huntercd> Flush the toilet Jill
[1:55:27] <MurlinDurl> its all about that beret Kreygasm
[1:55:27] <%natebud> Jill interupted that mans fully clothed bath
[1:55:29] <%bigdumbidiotguy> I hope he's okay guys :(
[1:55:29] <%Agami23> that zombie probably is slower and smells more disgusting than any of the others since it was stewing in the bathtub. probably super water logged
[1:55:29] <Zaphire_Saucypants> I don't get it, why doesn't Jill vomit in her purse?
[1:55:31] <$Afterman_> god the camera angels here are so good
[1:55:32] <%necrocannibal2> @AngriestPat this or RE2 remake?

[1:55:35] <%天使42199> @happyface699 maybe the backgrounds. the models show there age a bit
[1:55:35] <%RedMageRebel> I mean she crushed a guys head in; unless you've been to like war that's gonna get most people I think
[1:55:38] <%JonesMcFly> Did Jill just puke down the front of her shirt?
[1:55:38] <%adventurerjess> that was a super fancy dagger
[1:55:39] <+SlappyMeats> should have puked in the tub, cuz at least we know the drain works

[1:55:54] <ralphfromdk> Jill has to be the most squeamish cop ever.
[1:55:55] <MurlinDurl> she barfed into her shirt to carry it Kappa
[1:55:55] <%JJCheeker> Well it looks amazing

[1:57:39] <%Laecerelius> BEST BOY BARRY
[1:57:39] <+Chopper3k> avoiding eye contact
[1:57:40] <%bigdumbidiotguy> @angriestpat did you know that Barry used to work at Pottery Barn?
[1:57:44] <+Th3SmartAlec> "Don't tell Wesker"
[1:57:45] <%draugrix> Jill sandvvich
[1:57:45] <Kiraklene> Barry is best boi
[1:57:47] <+SlappyMeats> yeah that was lined up pretty well; in the original, he kicks the door inward and the screen blacks before the door model conflicts with the ceiling
[1:57:47] <+DiabloDeAzul> spoiler: he loosened the door handle
[1:57:47] <%necrocannibal2> @AngriestPat this or RE2 remake?
[1:57:50] <deviljhojho_> Barry is our boy
[1:57:51] <zenith0111> calebKek
[1:57:51] <TheIronBrass> Sure hope he won't betray me
[1:57:52] <OverlordedK> I look forward to Revs 2
[1:57:52] <Butterjawgaming> apatSkelmo
[1:57:52] <Engwithan_Elder_God> Didn't he use to have more of a beard?
[1:57:52] <ralphfromdk> CommanderSqueaks It's just a funny cast of ludunarative disco bisquits. She's so useless in cutscenes, yet gameplay she's all Leon from RE4 levels of good
[1:57:53] <Faustgesicht> I really like that call-back. They handled it well
[1:57:53] <majima666> yah yah
[1:57:54] <rytisone> I seen it
[1:57:54] <%ElenaManetta> remember that time that barry told his kid all about the sandwich joke because he was so proud of it
[1:57:54] <%Caped_Eggy> I saw it
[1:57:54] <%dheng1> your social link with barry went up
[1:57:56] <%starotter70> Could see a little
[1:57:56] <SheefEatsBeef> i saw it :)
[1:57:58] <cant_pick_a_name> should've kept the original lines voices and all
[1:57:58] <%happyface699> FAMILY Family FAMILY
[1:57:59] <+JJAllDay> HEY JILL PANNINI DON'T YOU BE A MEANIE
[1:58:00] <TalisKanju> Go get the letter in the Fishing Lure room
[1:58:00] <Fien111> OH GOD I ALMOST DIED THANK YOU SO M......wait, you're not in the exact area you said you'd be 20 minutes ago!
[1:58:01] <%dukenux> Everyone should yearn for a Barry in their livea
[1:58:02] <%天使42199> I think this remake is still better then remake 2
[1:58:03] <Fujiwara_92> I saw it
[1:58:03] <+Grayhammatter> barry is best revelaiton
[1:58:04] <%peachy996> Ah the broken door
[1:58:05] <%JJCheeker> That's not a fair comparison
[1:58:05] <MyNameIsRasus> My day is ruined and my dissapointment is immesurable
[1:58:07] <TalisKanju> Before Barry tears it
[1:58:08] <FirearmsInstructor> @AngriestPat What are you playing this on? PC/Steam? (Also achievement toast is 20% visible bottom corner)
[1:58:08] <ScreamLord> @Jane_Lo True. It was arguably the most powerful console of its generation. Only the dumb mini-disc format held it back
[1:58:09] <Peculiar_Pangolin> This is way better than the RE2 remake
[1:58:10] <zayasu> this
[1:58:11] <%GabeSweetMan> FUCK WOW
[1:58:11] <%SilverFaustX> re1 is a remaster not a remake
[1:58:11] <+SlappyMeats> 7
[1:58:12] <Nina96> wow
[1:58:12] <+Th3SmartAlec> tough boy
[1:58:12] <%Valdorick> What a shitlord
[1:58:13] <%RedMageRebel> damn hes tall
[1:58:14] <SheefEatsBeef> wow he's not going down
[1:58:15] <%bigdumbidiotguy> rude
[1:58:15] <deviljhojho_> bonk
[1:58:16] <%Laecerelius> He's a fucking strong boy
[1:58:16] <%blaggablag> If Capcom didn't have combinis selling Jill Sandwiches through the week this came out they oughta fire their marketing dept
[1:58:16] <+Th3SmartAlec> ????
[1:58:17] <%starotter70> Durable motherfucker
[1:58:19] <dreu81> re2 remake had the same effect as this did when it came out. quite a feat
[1:58:20] <%peachy996> I love the broken door but I also hate the broken door
[1:58:23] <%GabeSweetMan> EMPLOYEE OF THE MONTH
[1:58:23] <rytisone> tough boy
[1:58:23] <ThisGamingDragon> Pat at least Jill looks like Jill in the remake which is more than I can say for Claire
[1:58:24] <Ner234> What a tough bastardd
[1:58:24] <%bigdumbidiotguy> what did he ever do to you
[1:58:27] <%天使42199> @silverfaustx this IS a remake... ? of the ps1 re
[1:58:27] <$JohnnyMedia> so what's better, awkwardly bad Voice acting or kinda decentish acting?
[1:58:27] <%Jolnir> Hi pat
[1:58:27] <+DiabloDeAzul> pick up the knife
[1:58:28] <%Erimos> @AngriestPat hey Pat, use your knife
[1:58:28] <MachineHead9> re2 remake is so good Kreygasm
[1:58:29] <+Remery_> sykAngr sykAngr
[1:58:31] <MyNameIsRasus> when you absolutely have to kill every motherfucker in the room
[1:58:31] <FatherGreyBeard> powerful
[1:58:32] <%natebud> Can't say he didn't do his best
[1:58:37] <valke___> I like REmake 1 more cause of the route differences and it doesn't have the fucking G2 shipping container fight
[1:58:42] <%bigdumbidiotguy> what if they're all just sleepwalking?
[1:58:43] <Peculiar_Pangolin> knife does half an enemy's health i think
[1:58:44] <%SilverFaustX> this is the remaster of the gc remaster
[1:58:45] <kingbaconcrispy> You didn't have to kill him. He can be easily avoided.
[1:58:46] <%Cooksey89> I hate what they did with Jill in later games
[1:58:46] <+K2YP70C0CK> atpGasm dat healf meter
[1:58:47] <Peculiar_Pangolin> dagger rather
[1:58:48] <%adventurerjess> door simulator
[1:58:52] <%RedMageRebel> that shipping fight isnt bad, just boring
[1:58:54] <%Darastrix> Those shoulder pads are ridiculous
[1:58:56] <%dukenux> shit
[1:58:59] <%天使42199> @silverfaustx no shit but he's talking about it as a whole
[1:59:01] <TechDragon_Z> 3 times and only from this side
[1:59:03] <%GabeSweetMan> NICE camera placement
[1:59:08] <%SilverFaustX> didnt hear that
[1:59:09] <%necrocannibal2> this game is a remake that was remastered 3 times
[1:59:12] <kingbaconcrispy> @Darastrix You mean sexy
[1:59:13] <%Theastrica> i wish my tuesdays werent so shit andi could stay up longer, but i gotta go get some sleep. night all!
[1:59:15] <+TheBitingIrish> I fucking HATE THAT DOORKNOB
[1:59:15] <%RedMageRebel> man these are tough boys
[1:59:16] <MyNameIsRasus> uuuuuuuughhhhhhh
[1:59:16] <TheTrueZyozz> Can of fizz.
[1:59:18] <djazo> man this game sold really bad doodSad
[1:59:18] <+Th3SmartAlec> 6 + defensive sees to do it
[1:59:19] <%RubberFistFight> ohno the zambo wants the aneemay tiddo flesh
[1:59:20] <$milhousego> @cooksey89 you don't like that they made her a big titty blonde waifu?
[1:59:20] <%bigdumbidiotguy> Zombor
[1:59:24] <%blaggablag> Impacts on this one sound like you're giving that flesh a good slosh
[1:59:26] <+hawkeye726> Have you ever played Gwent pat?
[1:59:27] <+SlappyMeats> chonky bois
[1:59:27] <rytisone> game decided that you have too many bullets
[1:59:28] <+K2YP70C0CK> redic muzzleflash
[1:59:30] <+SinisterBroccoli> Is shooting zombies random?
[1:59:30] <%peachy996> They're tougher
[1:59:30] <+DiabloDeAzul> I guess pat doesn't like free knives
[1:59:31] <cant_pick_a_name> is pat doing a genocide run or something?
[1:59:32] <Zaphire_Saucypants> You're on mountain difficulty, right?
[1:59:34] <cant_pick_a_name> lol
[1:59:35] <+DinnerCalzone> SourPls
[1:59:36] <%Erimos> Kreygasm
[1:59:36] <%starotter70> Ahhhhhh
[1:59:37] <TalisKanju> RE 1 Remake doesn't require the player to have foresight about choosing what items to give Chris
[1:59:42] <Fujiwara_92> SourPls
[1:59:43] <%starotter70> Love this track
[1:59:43] <%天使42199> yeah pat is a mountain man
[1:59:44] <kingbaconcrispy> You could have used the shotgun. 60 % chance of decapitation. It's a good moment to use it.
[1:59:46] <rytisone> This theme is the best
[1:59:47] <ScreamLord> @AngriestPat Why not just reload normally outside of combat? It's probably faster
[1:59:47] <%Ranger747> thats the one
[1:59:47] <+machshop> ahhh warm light
[1:59:50] <+CptBritches> Best save room theme Kreygasm
[1:59:50] <FirearmsInstructor> Jill's reaction to that Beretta's recoil is ABSURD. 9mm does NOT kick that hard. I don't care how emaciated your arms / muscles are.... but I realize vidjyagaemz
[1:59:56] <majima666> i recently found a load of re osts in flac
[1:59:58] <%manwithboxonhead> Safety Music.
[1:59:59] <+SlappyMeats> light chan uwu
[2:00:00] <%godzookylives> Best save room theme
[2:00:01] <%NovaKnightmare> "beings"
[2:00:03] <%Faustgesicht> Listen to this Majula-ass save room music
[2:00:03] <+Th3SmartAlec> they look just like humans
[2:00:04] <dungpie64> Why can't we get more remakes without changing camera perspective?
[2:00:04] <%NovaKnightmare> just call em zombies
[2:00:07] <foreverN2dust> this music Kreygasm
[2:00:08] <%bigdumbidiotguy> brain buggo
[2:00:08] <%Aydarkzero> this save room theme Kreygasm
[2:00:13] <%ancrest_tant> This game is not pleasant if you wear headphones
[2:00:14] <FirearmsInstructor> @godzookylives notkohThink maybe....
[2:00:15] <+K2YP70C0CK> sway atpSeed atpSeed atpSeed atpSeed atpSeed atpSeed
[2:00:16] <%天使42199> this is a great save theme... for all the flack CVX gets though I think it still had the best save room theme
[2:00:19] <%trueherobappo> B E I N G S
[2:00:20] <+machshop> did you really need a numbered list for 2 things
[2:00:20] <JayEarly> save and chill
[2:00:21] <%bigdumbidiotguy> burn their wieners 0ff
[2:00:21] <TalisKanju> This theme is better in the original
[2:00:21] <ThisGamingDragon> At least this remake keeps the save room theme
[2:00:21] <bugsmr> this musics amazing
[2:00:23] <%necrocannibal2> pretty ominous note
[2:00:23] <Nina96> best save room theme imo
[2:00:28] <+Th3SmartAlec> "can we just leave?" "no"
[2:00:30] <%necrocannibal2> this save room theme Kreygasm
[2:00:34] <NaturalGear> this theme is very uncanny
[2:00:34] <%adventurerjess> the fire of her soul
[2:00:36] <%RedMageRebel> @FirearmsInstructor I mean a lot of people prefer .380 for a reason, but I get you. I just cant stand how CHUNKY the 92 is
[2:00:38] <Zaphire_Saucypants> go back and burn those guys in the the cemetary....dey givin me anxiety.
[2:00:38] <%necrocannibal2> god
[2:00:38] <%manwithboxonhead> Thanks God for that heads up.
[2:00:38] <%JJCheeker> This is my second favorite savaru music
[2:00:42] <%Caped_Eggy> !uptime
[2:00:42] <@Moobot> I've been playing this game for how long? Oh only 2h 44s.
[2:00:44] <%peachy996> Doggo room first
[2:00:45] <+chunkymonkey737> real survivor horror makes this so much more crazy
[2:00:47] <%Aydarkzero> this save room theme is safe... but uncertain about what will happen to you next
[2:00:47] <MyNameIsRasus> Man I miss Chrisposting
[2:00:48] <%dukenux> for some reason it reminds me of Diablo soundtrack
[2:00:48] <+Ploobie> Pat is the scariest and most powerful Crimson Head.
[2:00:48] <%JJCheeker> Save room
[2:00:49] <AdmiralButtloaf> safe room music is really earie
[2:00:50] <+SlappyMeats> no leaving, borkers outside
[2:00:51] <%happyface699> cmonBruh beings???
[2:00:54] <FirearmsInstructor> @AngriestPat How's the combat knife in this version? What's the knife-rankings? CVX.... then what?
[2:00:59] <%peachy996> Drain Doggo room of all resources and never go back to it again
[2:01:01] <%RedMageRebel> this music is spooky as fuck
[2:01:03] <majima666> half full or half empty?
[2:01:04] <Zaphire_Saucypants> oh yeah, you need the lighter...
[2:01:04] <ThatOneGuyYouSaw> why can't you just leave the brokendoornopen?
[2:01:05] <%dukenux> very haunting
[2:01:06] <%天使42199> @firearmsinstructor this knife sucks
[2:01:07] <%bigdumbidiotguy> wooooo party time she got the lean

[2:01:10] <@commanderclaw> Cause Umbrella has to save money man
[2:01:13] <%JJCheeker> re2 safe room music is my favorite
[2:01:13] <+Th3SmartAlec> @FirearmsInstructor RE2 Remake knife is up there
[2:01:16] <%legendscar01> Whats up nerds
[2:01:16] <FirearmsInstructor> @天使42199 :)
[2:01:17] <%Sausious> there's more outside
[2:01:23] <+buffn99> Never played re1, who are all the zombies inside the spencer mansion? Umbrella employess/experiments?
[2:01:25] <Quietshun13> best music
[2:01:28] <FirearmsInstructor> @Th3SmartAlec yeah I'd rank that high because of how much control I have with it
[2:01:29] <Peculiar_Pangolin> This music reminds me of the character creation music in Dark Souls 1
[2:01:29] <MurlinDurl> calm yet kinda creepy i like it
[2:01:33] <%peachy996> Ink Ribbons are crazy generous in Mountain
[2:01:33] <LixFury> This is umbrellas WetWipes LUL
[2:01:34] <MyNameIsRasus> I love that typewriter sound
[2:01:34] <TheTrueZyozz> I'm synced with your music while I'm at the other save room.
[2:01:35] <$milhousego> apatCrazyhead
[2:01:39] <%starotter70> @Peculiar_Pangolin I can hear that
[2:01:42] <%legendscar01> Resident evil 2 is better
[2:01:42] <%Caped_Eggy> Sounds like wind howling
[2:01:48] <SleepyMaribo> @AngriestPat will you be showing off the one tough zombie mode?
[2:01:49] <NaturalGear> I mean, it's not as good as clown farts
[2:01:50] <%natebud> Much time
[2:01:51] <JayEarly> Chris gets a lighter which is one of his very few advantages over Jill
[2:01:55] <%marsproject> @AngriestPat The theme is very calm but the wail in it makes it very eerie though
[2:01:57] <rytisone> whaat? he not dead?
[2:01:57] <%Madbearv> crimson heads
[2:01:57] <%SaiyanShoto> Pat has a soothing voice
[2:01:58] <+Th3SmartAlec> @FirearmsInstructor yeah, and once you got a zombie down it's free ammo at that point

[2:04:36] <Starshield1918> Pat, you can mash out of the bites
[2:04:37] <Quietshun13> no
[2:04:37] <+SlappyMeats> @AngriestPat Chris can take some hits because Chris HAS TO take some hits, cuz dude can't carry shit, can't pick locks, can't play piano, and has to babysit Becky

[2:04:48] <%Faustgesicht> Make a nice even 3 for us
[2:04:48] <%Theycallmenerf> It’s like the Nemesis fight all over again.
[2:04:49] <%RubberFistFight> Jesus Pat, your stream's deterioration is intensifying by the second Kappa
[2:04:51] <MyNameIsRasus> THAT GUY'S A MANIAC

[2:04:52] <%miguelrod777> Easymode is now selectable
[2:04:52] <ape_hawk> theyre pussies, i can take them on with my katana!
[2:04:52] <djazo> @adventurerjess wtf a armor is goig to a bite to the neck LUL
[2:04:52] <%Aydarkzero> this hallway is CURSED
[2:04:53] <%hawk_rush> remember kids, always give up Kappa
[2:04:55] <%Too_Much_Nukie> But are zombies more dangerous than riding in a car without a seat belt?
[2:04:56] <SMuffinMan> pndCheeky pndBigHeadedIdiot
[2:04:56] <+Th3SmartAlec> What's the deal, with zombies?
[2:04:56] <%radda343> Fuck Hallway is the worst hallway
[2:04:57] <Fujiwara_92> LUL
[2:04:58] <%natebud> It's like climbing a mountain
[2:04:59] <%bluebiscuit94> Actually it does, especialy when compared to nothing that CVX zombies were
[2:04:59] <Ner234> ! CURSED !
[2:05:02] <NobuuNobuu> Not sure I apreciated much can you do that again?
[2:05:03] <Starshield1918> Lure him to the stairs
[2:05:03] <Ran196> that hallway is for the Help
[2:05:05] <+Th3SmartAlec> NICE
[2:05:06] <%0oki> There’s a way to only get bitten once but I don’t remember how on classic controllers
[2:05:06] <MyNameIsRasus> Anotha one
[2:05:06] <%ElenaManetta> every RE game, you get stuck on one enemy in a hallway
[2:05:07] <Starshield1918> they can only barf on the stairs
[2:05:11] <%legendscar01> @AngriestPat This game is easy pat, a child can beat it
[2:05:11] <EuropanLamprey> Pat has decided to die
[2:05:13] <+professormorrigan> Scripted headshot D:
[2:05:14] <MurlinDurl> you only get 1 Kappa
[2:05:16] <+pectusumbra> YEYEYEYEYEY YOU CAN REPRODUCE IT
[2:05:17] <Fien111> We're at 2 deaths people. Takings bets for game total! Ten high has the odds!
[2:05:17] <+Th3SmartAlec> WE DID IT
[2:05:18] <%GabeSweetMan> WHY THAT TIME?
[2:05:19] <Vitriolic3s> Chris's story feels much harder than Jill's. Yeah he can take more hits but has to do more item management
[2:05:19] <outis94> how much shit can pat eat in the frozem time
[2:05:21] <MachineHead9> rng based
[2:05:21] <Quietshun13> baked rng
[2:05:22] <rytisone> It is all decided
[2:05:22] <%Aydarkzero> @AngriestPat yo when did Jill get a god roll shotgun Kappa
[2:05:23] <Peculiar_Pangolin> It's RNG
[2:05:24] <%JJCheeker> What is the always pops their head
[2:05:24] <thechainsawyer> I think im gon a need another one
[2:05:24] <%peachy996> It might be
[2:05:27] <kingbaconcrispy> @AngriestPat Mash the button or run back and forth to bait them. Although I do agree that this hallway is shit. I played 11 times and it still causes me problems.
[2:05:27] <%hawk_rush> we did it guys \ Kappa /
[2:05:28] <Starshield1918> In Remake decap rate with Shotgun is about 50%
[2:05:28] <%PauliusMaximus> theres a sweet spot with the distance
[2:05:29] <dungpie64> Game took pity on you
[2:05:31] <Nina96> semi-scripted?
[2:05:32] <%Shadicara> Scripted LUL
[2:05:32] <%JJCheeker> one of
[2:05:33] <%ElenaManetta> this whole stream is scripted
[2:05:33] <MyNameIsRasus> CAN'T ESCAPE FROM HEADSHOT FATE
[2:05:34] <%dasmause> first zombie shot with a shotgun is guaranteed head assplode i think, IIRC
[2:05:35] <%shadylawyerman> Sorry had to leave. new episode of MHA is fantastic that's all
[2:05:35] <%walternatorz> how are we supposed to know how dangerous zombies are now??
[2:05:35] <FirearmsInstructor> @RedMageRebel Yeah the 92 is chonk, but even so, even +P+ doesn't make a gun jump that far back. That's .500 magnum or .454 casull arm flapping. 9mm recoil might suck, but she's basically a swat member. LUL
[2:05:36] <kingbaconcrispy> Not scripted. 60% chance
[2:05:37] <+mmack093> Would you be ok with a resident evil 1 remake if they got rid of the slow door opening?
[2:05:38] <Judeknight> Headshots have a random percentage
[2:05:39] <%Engwithan_Elder_God> Easy mode activated.
[2:05:39] <Fujiwara_92> sure it is
[2:05:41] <+pectusumbra> If you WAIT, and do the lock on at JUST the right time you get 100% headshots
[2:05:41] <Fien111> Taking 50 on less than ten, 5 on more!
[2:05:41] <onionfryman> LP tax
[2:05:42] <%legendscar01> Where's Resident Evil 4?

[2:05:57] <%0oki> First head shot with shotgun is always critical hit, learned that from carcinogen @angriestpat
[2:05:58] <$RealThiele> horb
[2:06:00] <ThisGamingDragon> Has anyone heard the save room remixes from Mono Memory?
[2:06:00] <+pectusumbra> Is this the dolphin version?
[2:06:01] <%Zerodyne90> it's shut
[2:06:05] <Starshield1918> Ya know, I honestly think that the difficulty gap between Chris and Jill was made SIGNIFICANTLY lower in REmake
[2:06:06] <rempai1> Why no fullscreen with u in the corner @AngriestPat
[2:06:06] <%JJCheeker> Everybody gets one
[2:06:06] <%RubberFistFight> @mmack093 technically this IS a resident evil remake, lol.
[2:06:08] <%Shadicara> !uptime
[2:06:08] <@Moobot> I've been playing this game for how long? Oh only 2h 6m.
[2:06:09] <+SlappyMeats> spoiled by RE2 classic shotgun, where even the basic shotty will 100% decap up to 3 zombies at once
[2:06:13] <double_anarchey115> been gone like 15 minutes, what I miss?
[2:06:15] <+FootMeetsFace> FootMeetsFace subscribed at Tier 1. 
[2:06:18] <NaturalGear> do beheaded zombos become crimson heads?
[2:06:21] <dungpie64> Wasn't there a map above fire place?
[2:06:23] <VioletRosefall> does this game have Crimson Heads or was that Zero?
[2:06:26] <%0oki> Yup
[2:06:26] <+chunkymonkey737> carci's a cool guy
[2:06:27] <MachineHead9> NaturalGear no
[2:06:28] <+Th3SmartAlec> @NaturalGear LUL
[2:06:28] <%Madbearv> pat u gotta set'em on fire
[2:06:32] <JayEarly> @naturalgear no they’re dead dead
[2:06:33] <Starshield1918> You can also shoot their legs off
[2:06:34] <%Too_Much_Nukie> Is that why in Mercenaries Jill's weapons always have higher crit rates?
[2:06:34] <%天使42199> @violetrosefall this one
[2:06:34] <%Aydarkzero> wait so shotgun head shots require a bit more finesse?
[2:06:35] <%Erimos> I like the slow door opening, but maybe only the first time should play the cutscene, every other time you can skip.
[2:06:35] <Zaphire_Saucypants> nice
[2:06:36] <%Cooksey89> Imagine RE1 with Mr X
[2:06:37] <%natebud> There's no head to become crimson
[2:06:38] <+Th3SmartAlec> YOOOOOO
[2:06:38] <%bigdumbidiotguy> monkey frogs
[2:06:39] <%trueherobappo> wait
[2:06:39] <kingbaconcrispy> @VioletRosefall This one.

[2:06:42] <%Shadicara> ez
[2:06:43] <%RedMageRebel> @FirearmsInstructor oh you're right for sure. Probably just to "sell" it; I doubt most japenese devs actually have a frame of reference for how guns feel when fired
[2:06:43] <%marsproject> SO LUCKY!
[2:06:44] <%Pukenasty> nice crit
[2:06:44] <+SlappyMeats> without a head, what would become crimson?
[2:06:45] <+professormorrigan> so juicy
[2:06:46] <%peachy996> Nice
[2:06:46] <VioletRosefall> ok
[2:06:46] <%trueherobappo> did h really miss that command grab?
[2:06:46] <allanmiri> Fucking POP!
[2:06:47] <Fujiwara_92> nice
[2:06:47] <%manwithboxonhead> WHAT
[2:06:51] <+Ploobie> Pat is King of the Crimson Heads.
[2:06:51] <%Ganerumo> I love this droning music so much god damn
[2:06:51] <$RealThiele> there can be only one baldman
[2:06:54] <%CommanderSqueaks> Can't be a Crimson Head if you ain't got NO HEAD.

[2:07:12] <uncledoodsauce> in re2 the crimson heads evolved into lickers
[2:07:21] <%godzookylives> What a dipshit
[2:07:22] <Fien111> Bad Netcode, Capcom needs to fix its shit or Zombie is unplayable in SF5
[2:07:26] <Adam_ET> I kinda wanna see this re-remade to be like the RE2 remake
[2:07:27] <FirearmsInstructor> @RedMageRebel to be fair I doubt most Americans know, either.
[2:07:27] <ThisGamingDragon> "Command grab"
[2:07:28] <%Too_Much_Nukie> @RedMageRebel I mean, they went to a firing range for every single RE game. You know this because they list the range in the credits.
[2:07:29] <%SolverCODO> If you wanna be a king crimson you actually need two heads

[2:07:51] <VJdarkworld> this game is purty

[2:08:03] <%heroicspiritavenger> @dukenux Yes

[2:08:41] <DandyMackeroos> Everybody
[2:08:42] <ThisGamingDragon> @Adam_ET I Would rather have RE2 be like this game
[2:08:43] <%bigdumbidiotguy> @angriestpat you always burn a fat doobie 420 blaze it tbh
[2:08:43] <%天使42199> the ones in the areas you backtrack
[2:08:43] <%natebud> Or just take Chris and blow up everyone's head
[2:08:47] <luckycloud91> Fogo na babilônia
[2:08:49] <%Too_Much_Nukie> @RedMageRebel In RE7 they actually went to a JSDF base to use their range and arsenal. Even though that game has no automatic guns.
[2:08:50] <%heroicspiritavenger> Any of them near a save room, and in that hallway with the corpse near the arrowhead
[2:08:51] <+flexin_apex> burn em ALL!
[2:08:52] <FirearmsInstructor> Is there a limit to the number you can burn? Why not all of them?
[2:08:53] <%dukenux> THAT GUYS A MANIAC

[2:09:15] <%dukenux> ~Nic Cage probly
[2:09:15] <Ran196> just burn the mansion down
[2:09:15] <+Grayhammatter> sick burns
[2:09:16] <warmnoid> i beat this game 3 times and never knew you could get a map for the 2nd floor NotLikeThis
[2:09:16] <%necrocannibal2> Chris? burn
[2:09:17] <TalisKanju> My favorite part of this game is where you try to burn a zombie and it gets up anyway
[2:09:17] <+NinjaWitaSniper> @AngriestPat I always avoided burning them because I'd rather keep my inventory and just spend the ammo later to kill them, they still go down easy with a shotgun
[2:09:18] <kingbaconcrispy> Mash the button on the stairs.
[2:09:18] <%necrocannibal2> Barry? burn
[2:09:20] <+Th3SmartAlec> gottem

[2:09:22] <VJdarkworld> burnie burns
[2:09:24] <%heroicspiritavenger> INB4 PAT KILLS HIMSELF BY BURNING JILL
[2:09:24] <Zaphire_Saucypants> 2 guys in the cemetary?
[2:09:25] <Adam_ET> @ThisGamingDragon I'd be fine with either TBH
[2:09:28] <Fien111> Hallways of Always, but never rooms
[2:09:28] <FirearmsInstructor> @天使42199 The can in the room there depletes with refills?
[2:09:30] <cant_pick_a_name> pro tip: if you don't kill zombies they can't come back as crimson heads
[2:09:35] <%天使42199> @firearmsinstructor yup
[2:09:36] <%peachy996> @Zaphire_Saucypants Nope they're gone
[2:09:37] <cant_pick_a_name> who would have thought
[2:09:41] <korpocalypse> ILY!!! @AngriestPat
[2:09:43] <+flexin_apex> pat got the sickest burns
[2:09:44] <%Mekhet09> Boy it's amazing these floors and walls are able to take you burning bodies so well.
[2:09:47] <+SlappyMeats> so if you run past zombies instead of shooting them, they inevitably become redheads, yeah?
[2:09:47] <kingbaconcrispy> The fire can hurt you!
[2:09:47] <FirearmsInstructor> @天使42199 btw thx so much for the response / info. I appreciate it.
[2:09:48] <%starotter70> No Honor
[2:09:52] <%supercasualboom> “Yo Mama!!!” at the zombies = burned
[2:09:55] <%bigdumbidiotguy> one time I burned some trash outside in the bonfire pit
[2:09:55] <DandyMackeroos> Don’t the zombie get cleared out when the hunters come in?
[2:09:56] <Judeknight> Wait, fire bad?
[2:09:57] <RDknight> how long does it take for them to get back up if you dont burn them?
[2:09:58] <%天使42199> @firearmsinstructor no problem lol
[2:09:58] <%natebud> Crimson heads are great, preventing crimson heads is annoying.
[2:10:01] <$RealThiele> setting yourself on fire bad
[2:10:01] <Starshield1918> I don't think it damages you, just makes you stumble back
[2:10:02] <ch4ey> Are u doing speed running on this today?
[2:10:02] <%walternatorz> @AngriestPat can you show us the dangers of fire?
[2:10:07] <allanmiri> Jill accidently burns the whole mansion down
[2:10:12] <%Zerodyne90> you were the chosen one!
[2:10:12] <DandyMackeroos> Fire hurts
[2:10:12] <+Th3SmartAlec> 3rd one?
[2:10:13] <%dasmause> @AngriestPat you can try to kill zombies on top of each other to burn two or more for one gasoline dose
[2:10:14] <+NinjaWitaSniper> @RDknight 30 real life minutes
[2:10:19] <Peculiar_Pangolin> You can burn more than one at a time too if they're on top of eachother
[2:10:21] <%Kegeto> i love the concept of burning the body but it also annoying if your not close to the item box
[2:10:24] <%ElenaManetta> 99% of house fires in america are due to unchecked zombie burning
[2:10:28] <%FalseEyeD> Why wait?
[2:10:29] <+pectusumbra> Could you imagine Jill doing this and the mansion just burning down
[2:10:34] <$RealThiele> jill would save a lot of time burning it all down
[2:10:35] <%dukenux> you could easily set a fire to entire mansion like that
[2:10:36] <Starshield1918> My record is 3 in 1
[2:10:36] <MyNameIsRasus> that's a pro strat
[2:10:37] <Adam_ET> @allanmiri Can't be trapped in a mansion if there's no mansion to be trapped in
[2:10:38] <%Kegeto> wait what?
[2:10:38] <Fien111> Jill just torching the entire mansion would solve so many problems.....and create so many more
[2:10:39] <%necrocannibal2> THIS SAVE ROOM THEME Kreygasm
[2:10:43] <%trekkie11041> there an achevement for thata
[2:10:44] <%bigdumbidiotguy> @angriestpat if you put gasoline on them twice their butts explode and poop flies everywhere
[2:10:51] <DandyMackeroos> Neat didn’t know that
[2:10:51] <Starshield1918> Also it's smart to fight zombies on the stairs as they can't bite
[2:10:56] <%StaceMcGate> @AngriestPat do all save rooms have kerosene refills?
[2:10:59] <%supercasualboom> Makes you think why didn’t you burn wooden doors?
[2:11:05] <ThisGamingDragon> I like how Jill looks like Jill remotely in the remake which is more than I can say for Claire
[2:11:05] <%RedMageRebel> god what game has that animation of you burning a body by just throwing down a match
[2:11:06] <%heroicspiritavenger> @StaceMcGate No
[2:11:06] <FirearmsInstructor> No need to burn if you pop their head, right? (I think you already answered like 10 mins ago.)
[2:11:06] <Oolated_Squigg> there's an achievement for that as well
[2:11:09] <%天使42199> @stacemcgate no not all of them iirc
[2:11:11] <%dukenux> a campfire :)
[2:11:17] <$Afterman_> no pat you find more kerosene
[2:11:19] <%RedMageRebel> I remember that animation but not the game
[2:11:21] <truta_> man these camera angles are spooky
[2:11:22] <%Shadicara> imagine if the zombies could breathe fire too
[2:11:22] <%supercasualboom> Two zombie...whose the bottom?
[2:11:24] <$Afterman_> unless on harder difficulties you dont
[2:11:24] <JayEarly> this game is so artfully made in every aspect
[2:11:24] <%legendscar01> Their burning Zombies in Australia?
[2:11:25] <%ElenaManetta> wow pat's a hacker
[2:11:28] <Starshield1918> I can only think of six
[2:11:28] <+SlappyMeats> @AngriestPat so unburned zombies and still "living" zombies become Crimson Heads, right? So you can't just run past zombies to preserve them in their unevolved state?
[2:11:29] <%NovaKnightmare> @AngriestPat whats better, this, Re4, or RE2Make?
[2:11:30] <%bigdumbidiotguy> do all the games have Vampires? @angriestpat
[2:11:34] <TriadOrion> Oh god. I hadn't realized there was so little kerosene in the whole game
[2:11:35] <%StaceMcGate> so will the player have to make a difficult decision on who to burn?
[2:11:36] <Starshield1918> Oh wait, the Residence
[2:11:37] <%necrocannibal2> the way zombies get up in this game is creepy af
[2:11:38] <TalisKanju> Some of those kerosene canisters aren't in Save Rooms

[2:11:46] <kingbaconcrispy> @SlappyMeats Yeah.

[2:20:16] <%draugrix> @agami23 wouldn't it be Grover
[2:20:16] <Zaphire_Saucypants> now the next pair....place it juuuust right....might get a twofer
[2:20:17] <DFireCreations> @angriestpat did you know you can taste with your balls
[2:20:17] <Neo_Kaiser> Does Pat want someone to make a death compilation?
[2:20:18] <DandyMackeroos> RE1 is lovely shlock though
[2:20:23] <$JohnnyMedia> i think the RE remakes are among the first to actually "Remake" their games the way I thought they would
[2:20:24] <+Th3SmartAlec> this is the stance
[2:20:25] <Savader> RE2 or RE2 Remake though?
[2:20:25] <rytisone> nope
[2:20:27] <+DinnerCalzone> this is the stance

[2:21:18] <%lugraylucid> Is there anything about RE1 that you prefer over REmake?

[2:22:16] <%JeanGardner6203> @AngriestPat Did you ever attempt Path of Pain in Hollow Knight?
[2:22:16] <%natebud> Just rewatching old streams with a notebook? Seems simple enough.
[2:22:17] <%peachy996> Pat wait by the door with a shotgun in the terrace, kill the key dog and get out before the other gets you. That doggo disappears too
[2:22:18] <%bigdumbidiotguy> do a compilation of how many spooky monsters are in the game and then upload it to yoytube
[2:22:18] <%Binary_Fireball> SO MANY CRIMSONS
[2:22:19] <%RedMageRebel> @RubberFistFight you're making me want to get back into editing beyond just doing my dumb news projects for classes
[2:22:20] <Neo_Kaiser> Someone should do a death compilation of every death in every game on every video.
[2:22:24] <%FalseEyeD> SingsNote Safety Dance SingsNote
[2:22:25] <%RubberFistFight> @AngriestPat dude you should see the amount of timecodes I have for the FIRST FUCKING EPISODE of hollow knight, it's amazing. I'm particularly amused by the ones that happen right after you talk yourself up, because of how fucking crestfallen you look afterwards.
[2:22:35] <%JJCheeker> How many streams do you think it will take to get through re 6?
[2:22:36] <Neo_Kaiser> Every Pat death compilation
[2:22:36] <+Grayhammatter> oh god

[2:22:53] <Zaphire_Saucypants> the assault
[2:22:53] <rytisone> use it as a baseball bat

[2:22:56] <MyNameIsRasus> fair
[2:22:57] <dungpie64> Just swing it around like a club
[2:23:01] <%spongeofmystery> IS this the original upscaled ot the PC HD version that came out a couple years ago?
[2:23:01] <chambatron> !uptime
[2:23:02] <@Moobot> I've been playing this game for how long? Oh only 2h 23m.
[2:23:03] <%Binary_Fireball> you just switch??
[2:23:03] <ovan20> That's 2 hours later tho!
[2:23:05] <+Kaiserzelcor> Heh you don't get it if you fucked up like I did
[2:23:07] <djazo> did you know that pat likes RE1 remake
[2:23:07] <Zaphire_Saucypants> yeah
[2:23:08] <%bigdumbidiotguy> Because you gry the Winchester 18826
[2:23:08] <artoflec> my friend is trying these games first playthrough on the hardest difficulty so im watching to see how certain things work elaSmile
[2:23:11] <kingbaconcrispy> It's not stronger but it has more capacity.
[2:23:11] <Mister_McDerp> oh, well thats objectively correct
[2:23:11] <%Shadicara> BUT WHAT IF I NEED IT LATER
[2:23:12] <%rufus2k2> same philosophy for RE4
[2:23:13] <%legendscar01> Stop being smart Pat
[2:23:13] <%Zebroneath> Someone remind me, are Crimson Heads based on game time, progression, or both?
[2:23:13] <%Elky3> apatCrazyhand apatCrazyhead
[2:23:14] <Starshield1918> Is there any difference between the assault shotgun and shotgun besides ammo capacity?
[2:23:14] <NaturalGear> apatGoblin
[2:23:16] <%StaceMcGate> @AngriestPat that just sounds like elixir and ether hoarding to me
[2:23:18] <FirearmsInstructor> @AngriestPat Didn't you definitively crush the path of pain?
[2:23:18] <Quietshun13> meh
[2:23:18] <cant_pick_a_name> you totally dont even need t
[2:23:18] <%TheMattman1313> Idk why but that item menu confirm noise is really satisfying
[2:23:20] <Funcokler_Xerow> trapped?! anneS
[2:23:22] <MachineHead9> the regular shotgun isn't so bad
[2:23:22] <Zaphire_Saucypants> just gotta save that Richard fuck from poison in time
[2:23:23] <%RedMageRebel> thats like saying never upgrade anything in re4 tho until the end
[2:23:23] <Peculiar_Pangolin> The other shotgun isn't that much better in terms of damge though
[2:23:23] <+Grayhammatter> straight up TRAPPED
[2:23:24] <zipfile777> thats big bs
[2:23:24] <%CommanderSqueaks> Okay that kinda makes sense.
[2:23:25] <%Erimos> Also you can pick up ammo along the way. It'll save you trips.
[2:23:26] <%rufus2k2> upgrade ammo every time you empty it
[2:23:28] <+DinnerCalzone> wh
[2:23:28] <%JJCheeker> Funny every time I play Jill I always forget to get the better shotgun
[2:23:28] <%Binary_Fireball> ... but how many shells?????
[2:23:29] <Taisuru> WHA-
[2:23:29] <%dukenux> WUT
[2:23:30] <Floofiie> wh
[2:23:34] <ThatOneGuyYouSaw> just take them out
[2:23:35] <Neo_Kaiser> But mind goblins prevent you from firing any weapon
[2:23:37] <%Dotta5> Good ole Barry fizz
[2:23:38] <Oolated_Squigg> does chris get the better shotgun? iirc no
[2:23:38] <+Th3SmartAlec> living things, yadda yadda
[2:23:38] <%ElenaManetta> barry will sell you fizz for $1 from his locker
[2:23:40] <%MayorRev> oh my fucking god someone just made a resident evil game mode in fortnite I am losing my fucking marbles
[2:23:40] <%FalseEyeD> This game is less than $8 right now
[2:23:42] <%natebud> Granted, but it doesn't make much of a difference because of how many shotgun shells you get in the game.
[2:23:44] <%Shadicara> Now time for the dog gauntlet
[2:23:45] <Fujiwara_92> wha- wha- wha -
[2:23:45] <Naho_Saenoki> @artoflec The best part about that is that Normal is the hardest difficulty available for REmake on a first playthrough.
[2:23:48] <MyNameIsRasus> you say that like you're gonna use the shells in either shotgun
[2:23:53] <%legendscar01> Jill' bath water
[2:24:03] <djazo> yeah this game is on a sale for like 10 bucks
[2:24:05] <zenith0111> All these Remakes and yet no Dragons Dogma atpFeelsBeardMan

[2:25:18] <Zaphire_Saucypants> noooo
[2:25:18] <%natebud> As Chris you have to use the first shotgun, you don't get the grenade launcher.
[2:25:18] <DandyMackeroos> There you go

[2:25:32] <%JJCheeker> Monkey dogs
[2:25:32] <%lugraylucid> apatPee apatPee
[2:25:34] <%ha2ken> Monkey gods
[2:25:35] <$shurtal> that sounded like a monkey
[2:25:37] <%RedMageRebel> was that a fucking monkey noise when he got hit mid air?
[2:25:37] <%rufus2k2> bork buster rounds
[2:25:41] <%manwithboxonhead> Here we go
[2:25:41] <+Jasuchin> Time to throw that shitgun away
[2:25:41] <%bigdumbidiotguy> monkey nan
[2:25:43] <%peachy996> That second dog disappears tho
[2:25:44] <%legendscar01> That was a slow motion jump
[2:25:47] <%bigdumbidiotguy> LE MONKE
[2:25:49] <%Shadicara> Now never reload the shotgun again pat Kappa
[2:25:52] <%necrocannibal2> but the crimson dogs though
[2:25:56] <%manwithboxonhead> Oh Shit this is it
[2:25:57] <ThatOneGuyYouSaw> which grenade rounds do you use for which enemies?
[2:25:59] <%peachy996> That second dog despawns like the Cemetary Zombies do
[2:25:59] <%RedMageRebel> that actually scared me holy shit
[2:26:01] <+DashXero> How sick would crimson headed dogs be?
[2:26:03] <%FalseEyeD> This growl <3
[2:26:04] <%manwithboxonhead> Actually not yet
[2:26:04] <Naho_Saenoki> @shurtal They stopped making them have dog death noises so you'd feel less bad killing them. So they make monkey noises instead.
[2:26:07] <%rufus2k2> clifford the big dead dog
[2:26:13] <Zaphire_Saucypants> damn
[2:26:17] <%bigdumbidiotguy> l00l
[2:26:20] <%lugraylucid> that took a lot
[2:26:20] <FirearmsInstructor> @AngriestPat What color herbs were out on that dog path outside? Green?
[2:26:23] <kingbaconcrispy> They can't grab you on the stairs. Only vomit, so you can run past them easily.
[2:26:23] <%FalseEyeD> Stupid Sexy Zombies
[2:26:23] <%GarbageNirvana> I forget, crimson heads weren't even a thing in the original, were they?
[2:26:29] <%natebud> Lucky luck boy
[2:26:30] <rytisone> low on ammo
[2:26:31] <%walternatorz> imagine if dogs had a crimson head variant
[2:26:31] <Naho_Saenoki> @GarbageNirvana They were not.
[2:26:31] <MyNameIsRasus> Some of these growls sound like the Dark Souls 1 player hurt noises
[2:26:32] <bugsmr> that stairway reminds me of a room in re7
[2:26:33] <%RubberFistFight> @GarbageNirvana that's right jay.
[2:26:33] <cant_pick_a_name> you can only use the herbs on the balcony
[2:26:35] <%bigdumbidiotguy> silver bullets against vampires. smart
[2:26:36] <%draugrix> apatWink_TK
[2:26:37] <Starshield1918> Random damage levels bro
[2:26:38] <cant_pick_a_name> iirc
[2:26:39] <%heroicspiritavenger> @GarbageNirvana nope
[2:26:39] <$shurtal> But now instead of feeling bad, I giggle @Naho_Saenoki they corrected too far in the opposite direction
[2:26:44] <%Too_Much_Nukie> Crimson Heads were absolutely NOT in the original.
[2:26:47] <%Ell1ot> I accidentally let Chris die in my first Remake play through as Jill. I didn't find him locked up so he blew up in the mansion.
[2:26:48] <frenchpooper> @AngriestPat real question, did u get a bit slimer? maybe it's the red. looking good today man
[2:26:48] <%legendscar01> Hunters
[2:26:57] <zenith0111> What's a crimson head?
[2:27:03] <%peachy996> Agreed
[2:27:03] <%RedMageRebel> im mad we didnt see crimson heads in any other ones

[2:28:58] <%heroicspiritavenger> @FirearmsInstructor You stick a live grenade in a zombie's mouth
[2:29:03] <%Binary_Fireball> how is grenade not strongest?
[2:29:06] <FirearmsInstructor> @heroicspiritavenger D:
[2:29:10] <%lugraylucid> I was really glad when RE2make brought back defensive items
[2:29:12] <Starshield1918> him having a lighter also makes burning zombies a bit easier for him
[2:29:12] <kingbaconcrispy> Nah Chris still sucks.
[2:29:13] <%starotter70> Oh dear
[2:29:17] <%SilverFaustX> lol have u seen the prize money for evo japan, its hilarious
[2:29:18] <Naho_Saenoki> @Binary_Fireball Grenade IS strongest.
[2:29:19] <rytisone> it's really dangerous
[2:29:19] <djazo> everything that kills is better then jill

[2:29:46] <chambatron> How are you not ounting the way back
[2:29:47] <%RubberFistFight> @AngriestPat ANOTHER QUESTION! You have an AT2020 mic from the looks of things. I am buying one tonight since my Yeti just shit the bed on me on my last stream. As someone who's been using one for a while, are there any recommendations or anything I should look out for/be aware of? Like, idiosyncrasies of the mic, etc?

[2:31:18] <worldbrand> too late
[2:31:19] <frenchpooper> why
[2:31:19] <rytisone> uppercut him
[2:31:20] <%RedMageRebel> I just have a Yeti and the world of non-usb mics is scary, just cause I'm the type of guy to keep buying more and more expensive shit
[2:31:21] <Fujiwara_92> why?
[2:31:22] <%0oki> Why not?
[2:31:23] <%bigdumbidiotguy> blow his head off and sometimes he will stay alive
[2:31:24] <warmnoid> crimson boi
[2:31:26] <%ha2ken> That was legit scary getting up
[2:31:26] <+richievillain> Sup Pat? what the hell you staring at?

[2:31:39] <%spongeofmystery> Dumb expensive and impractical trap time!
[2:31:40] <dungpie64> He's too important to keep alive
[2:31:40] <MachineHead9> once you kill a crimson it stays dead no reason to burn after
[2:31:41] <DandyMackeroos> That one scares me every time
[2:31:41] <Mirrorcatch> if you burn him you'll have a heated gamer moment
[2:31:43] <%ElenaManetta> look at this fucking contraption

[2:35:07] <%Froyuken> Almost had it.
[2:35:08] <+richievillain> they can open dooors!!!
[2:35:08] <allanmiri> HOly shit! I can't believe you got out of that! That was scary!
[2:35:10] <%RedMageRebel> why that cutscene for one zombie??
[2:35:12] <Naho_Saenoki> @Amplificate George Trevor designed the whole mansion. His daughter Lisa is an unkillable threat in this game that has a little of every virus injected into her. She even has a Nemesis parasite prototype in her.
[2:35:14] <LunarRemix> That was funny
[2:35:16] <%lugraylucid> VERY SCARY
[2:35:16] <Mister_McDerp> that was a close one
[2:35:17] <MyNameIsRasus> why was that so tensw
[2:35:18] <rytisone> imagine if JIll would just ocasionally trip over in gameplay
[2:35:19] <Starshield1918> In the OG clowns farting in the basement plays when that zombie shows up and its the funniest shit ever
[2:35:23] <%bigdumbidiotguy> he's hungry :)
[2:35:34] <+CallingField> Why was that random zombie’s introduction so dramatic?
[2:35:35] <marvel877> Time.
[2:35:35] <Starshield1918> I think it's time-based.
[2:35:36] <%Sausious> it's progress
[2:35:36] <Ran196> RNG
[2:35:36] <kingbaconcrispy> Tim
[2:35:36] <warmnoid> it's timed
[2:35:37] <%legendscar01> Time
[2:35:37] <+Kaiserzelcor> It's progress
[2:35:38] <%Froyuken> It's after you beat the daddy.
[2:35:39] <kingbaconcrispy> Time
[2:35:39] <MachineHead9> amount of time
[2:35:39] <majima666> its time isnt it?
[2:35:39] <%Agami23> real life time.
[2:35:40] <%aishman> Progress/Time
[2:35:40] <+NinjaWitaSniper> @AngriestPat 30-45 minutes
[2:35:40] <Fujiwara_92> time
[2:35:40] <wrightlight94> its time
[2:35:44] <+SlappyMeats> I think it's both time and progress
[2:35:44] <ovan20> @RedMageRebel because in roginal RE1 there's a cutscene for a zombie opening the door, so they kept it on the remake.
[2:35:45] <Mister_McDerp> zombie puberty
[2:35:46] <MyNameIsRasus> 30 minutes, wasn't it?
[2:35:46] <%Zebroneath> Game time?
[2:35:50] <+richievillain> PokGengar
[2:35:54] <%walternatorz> Timgress
[2:35:54] <%RedMageRebel> ahhhh
[2:35:58] <%lugraylucid> apatPee
[2:35:59] <marvel877> Time and also difficulty.
[2:36:02] <foreverN2dust> The distance time has progressed.
[2:36:02] <FirearmsInstructor> @RedMageRebel They had some extra funds in the CGI budget for the original? LUL idk.... same thing for the unskippable ruby bust / statue in RE2. I think?
[2:36:03] <%Garthunox> time and difficulty, higher difficulty means lower time
[2:36:03] <allanmiri> The game rolls a d20
[2:36:03] <%Dotta5> apatSmug_SG apatSmug_SG apatSmug_SG
[2:36:04] <%bigdumbidiotguy> could you bait a zombie with a cheeseburger made of human meat? @angriestpat
[2:36:05] <warmnoid> the time is based on the difficulty and different for each zombie iirc
[2:36:06] <%natebud> In later parts of the game zombies can turn almost instantly
[2:36:10] <+SlappyMeats> if you take too long to get out of here, they'll start turning on you, but they will def turn after you return to the mansion
[2:36:11] <%legendscar01> Game Time, usually after your back from Lisa's Cabin
[2:36:12] <Starshield1918> I killed every zombie without burning them and was able to get out of the first part of the mansion without seeing a Crimson head
[2:36:12] <%bluebiscuit94> Ok, it's almost 5am here, gotta go, have fun Pat anc chat, goodnight
[2:36:16] <kingbaconcrispy> The zombies in the lab don't turn. the naked ones.
[2:36:17] <Starshield1918> and was fast
[2:36:21] <Starshield1918> so I think it might be time
[2:36:23] <rytisone> the past is haunting you
[2:36:27] <Mexrage> Time, but the range depend each zombie
[2:36:31] <+richievillain> @bluebiscuit94 later bro
[2:36:39] <PkSilent01> What are crimson heads?
[2:36:40] <Captain_Joe1911> night @bluebiscuit94 :) /
[2:36:41] <+Kaiserzelcor> nevermind it's time based on what difficulty you're in
[2:36:45] <Traditionalscripture> Goodnight blue
[2:36:55] <%bigdumbidiotguy> would a zombie eat frog mest
[2:36:58] <%HibikiYamada> Crimson heads stopped me from playing this on my first run through.
[2:37:00] <%Erimos> It's that damn fourth chaos emerald.
[2:37:00] <kingbaconcrispy> @PkSilent01 Steroid zombies
[2:37:02] <%Dotta5> 1 chaos emerald so far
[2:37:03] <%lugraylucid> It's a chaos emerald
[2:37:03] <Zaphire_Saucypants> get dose shotgun shells
[2:37:05] <%Froyuken> @kingbaconcrispy Really? Then why is there kerosene in the lab?
[2:37:08] <%starotter70> @PkSilent01 Problems
[2:37:09] <%legendscar01> Property damage
[2:37:14] <FirearmsInstructor> @AngriestPat Why do they break the doorknob in this version so you can only go through twice? Force different pathing because it's too easy a route?
[2:37:17] <%HibikiYamada> i knew about them but underestimated how dangerous crimson heads are.
[2:37:18] <%ha2ken> That ticking of the clock sounds good
[2:37:18] <%Too_Much_Nukie> Jill put down the chaos emerald!
[2:37:19] <%bigdumbidiotguy> hope diamond
[2:37:21] <%PauliusMaximus> there is kerrosine in the lab
[2:37:26] <+richievillain> @pksilent01 after you kill a zombie, they come back stronger if you dont burn them
[2:37:31] <%Froyuken> @FirearmsInstructor Pretty much.
[2:37:32] <%PauliusMaximus> at the first typewriter
[2:37:34] <DandyMackeroos> I think the Crimson Heads are mutation of the T-virus
[2:37:36] <%spongeofmystery> Lab kerosene is for the three in the start corridor
[2:37:37] <%bigdumbidiotguy> theres Kerosine in my dads shed
[2:37:40] <%natebud> @PkSilent01 When you kill a zombie, after a certain amount of time/progress it will revive as a faster more dangerous variant.
[2:37:42] <%Sausious> barry fixes it when you come back to the mansiom amyway
[2:37:45] <%legendscar01> Grande Launcher
[2:37:47] <%spongeofmystery> BIRB ATTAC
[2:37:52] <%Erimos> I honestly wish more doors would break. It's an interesting mixup.
[2:37:53] <DragonSpooker> Poor Forrest
[2:37:54] <%legendscar01> Grenade Launcher
[2:37:57] <TheIronBrass> IT'S FORREST
[2:37:58] <ThatOneGuyYouSaw> just leave the door open?
[2:37:58] <Dragovus> It looks like the crows made a Forrest sandwich
[2:37:59] <%starotter70> it's Forest
[2:38:00] <MachineHead9> D:
[2:38:01] <%ElenaManetta> this game is very soothing on a cold January day
[2:38:02] <%logoth_> its FOREST! aahh my Codddd
[2:38:02] <%MoralCompassGaming> time for a kerosine-teeny
[2:38:03] <%dheng1> It’s forest
[2:38:03] <kingbaconcrispy> @Froyuken For the two upstairs. I'm talking about the naked ones. those ones just despawn.
[2:38:04] <%starotter70> OH MY COD
[2:38:05] <allanmiri> Oh my COD
[2:38:09] <%dheng1> Oh my Cod !!!!
[2:38:11] <FirearmsInstructor> Doesn't Barry fix the door knob at some point so you can use it again?
[2:38:13] <%natebud> He give the ghost up
[2:38:13] <rytisone> Forest Kaysen
[2:38:16] <%MoralCompassGaming> it's a martini with kerosene
[2:38:16] <%xbalmorax> Any plans to ever play Eternal Darkness again?
[2:38:19] <%legendscar01> Only heal items over here
[2:38:20] <cant_pick_a_name> I hope he doesn't come back. he'd be one dangerous zombie
[2:38:21] <DandyMackeroos> Then Crimson Heads turn into Lickers after a while.
[2:38:23] <%Froyuken> @kingbaconcrispy Ah. Noted.
[2:38:24] <%CommanderSqueaks> @ElenaManetta I am anxious to ask what else you consider "Soothing"
[2:38:24] <%peachy996> Fuck Forest he's an asshole in the extra mode
[2:38:25] <majima666> forrest law?
[2:38:28] <outis94> part of him is infact dog shit

[2:38:29] <%cdrom321> Oh my Call of Duty!!
[2:38:31] <Naho_Saenoki> @FirearmsInstructor Yeah, but it's so late in the game that it isn't really useful.
[2:38:32] <%Solidnick18> oh shit

[2:38:33] <+pectusumbra> Fast boy

[2:39:33] <Naho_Saenoki> @Froyuken Grenade Launcher.
[2:39:33] <djazo> ye
[2:39:38] <%Too_Much_Nukie> @AngriestPat Does the novelization of the game expand upon Forrest as a character or is he just a zombie/corpse with a name?
[2:39:39] <MurlinDurl> yesnt
[2:39:42] <%lugraylucid> I can't believe Pat ruined his no damage streak
[2:39:52] <%bigdumbidiotguy> there are at least 3 at Lowe's
[2:39:56] <Starshield1918> Save room, storage room, where you get the chemical, residence, lab
[2:40:03] <Starshield1918> Am I missing any?
[2:40:04] <%legendscar01> Or his no die stream
[2:40:08] <%RedMageRebel> @AngriestPat I find that fast jog to be WAY more unsettling on zombies than full out sprinting like later games and movies have for some reason
[2:40:10] <%Froyuken> I must've missed when he picked it up.
[2:40:13] <%starotter70> Just reset the whole RE marathon
[2:40:14] <%natebud> 2 in save rooms, one by the fertalizer, lab residence, tunnels... where else?
[2:40:17] <MurlinDurl> that note is HUGE
[2:40:20] <%xbalmorax> That original aspect ratio though. I hate it in widescreen.
[2:40:20] <%Dotta5> Crimson heads are caused by climate change
[2:40:20] <Naho_Saenoki> @Too_Much_Nukie It doesn't really, but the novelization isn'tr really canon anyway.
[2:40:27] <Starshield1918> I appreciate Barry writing 'em instead of them
[2:40:27] <+Kaiserzelcor> SWELL GUY BARRY HERE TO HELP
[2:40:28] <+DashXero> What a nice guy.
[2:40:36] <%RedMageRebel> you'd think these guys would have walkie talkies
[2:40:36] <TheTrueZyozz> They're big bullets.
[2:40:36] <king_tubb> @too_much_nukie he’s a member of STARS
[2:40:44] <%Too_Much_Nukie> @Naho_Saenoki Thanks. I don't actually care about Forrest but I was curious.
[2:40:44] <%necrocannibal2> give those protesters some Fizz, Jill
[2:40:44] <Dragovus> It's better than bullets
[2:40:46] <PortableBoredom> What if the zombies saw that instead and chugged your first aid spray
[2:40:46] <djazo> but it least you.r no death run is still going right ?
[2:40:46] <MurlinDurl> big boolet
[2:40:47] <Starshield1918> Flame rounds burn zombies too
[2:40:47] <rytisone> now leave him something from yourself
[2:40:48] <PortableBoredom> geez Barry
[2:40:50] <%natebud> Wesker leaves this stuff if you're playing as Chris.
[2:40:52] <copyritetm> this song always reminds me of the dark souls title music
[2:40:57] <Starshield1918> So Jill really doesn't need to be careful with Kerosene, now that I think about it
[2:40:58] <twindle07> DURACELL
[2:40:59] <+HyraFukit> Hi Pat, love you
[2:41:00] <%Froyuken> Jill's his ol' partner, ya know.
[2:41:02] <%CommanderSqueaks> Jill putting another note going "Um, actually these are SHELLS, not Bullets, BARRY!"
[2:41:08] <TheTrueZyozz> @RedMageRebel, you'll be eating those words in the near future.
[2:41:10] <Eye_of_Hades> "trouble" a.k.a. wesker trying to kill you via bio weapons
[2:41:10] <marvel877> Flame grenades good for burning corpses, Pat...
[2:41:14] <MattDemers> So the kerosine tanks in the save rooms aren't infinite?
[2:41:23] <%legendscar01> No
[2:41:24] <marvel877> no
[2:41:25] <ShichiNoBushi> Flaming Mo?
[2:41:27] <%starotter70> Say this Zombie is dissin' your 'Fly Girl'
[2:41:27] <%Froyuken> @MattDemers Nope.
[2:41:31] <Starshield1918> Save richard
[2:41:33] <Peculiar_Pangolin> @MattDemers They give you enough to burn 4 bodies
[2:41:33] <majima666> hey man, hes had a long day
[2:41:34] <%RedMageRebel> @TheTrueZyozz the running or the walkie talkies?
[2:41:34] <fusedforms> @RedMageRebel I think if a zombie goes faster than a fast jog it loses the Creepy Zombie Lurch
[2:41:35] <Starshield1918> or you won't get the assault shotgun
[2:41:36] <%starotter70> ya just give em one of these
[2:41:36] <kingbaconcrispy> @MattDemers No
[2:41:37] <+G_Thunders> I actually really hope R3make brings back crimson heads. Since the original game had random fast zombies anyway
[2:41:40] <Starshield1918> Pat you should save Richard right now
[2:41:41] <%xbalmorax> @redmagerebel Everyone knows Walkie Talkies weren't invented until 1999
[2:41:43] <DandyMackeroos> The Kerosene can are worth three or four refills I think
[2:41:46] <Starshield1918> he might die and you don't get his shotgun then
[2:41:46] <Clinnamon> STARS writing on the typewriter "yep, still stuck in this mansion"
[2:41:52] <TheTrueZyozz> @RedMageRebel, the walkie talkies.
[2:41:55] <FirearmsInstructor> @AngriestPat What difficulty are you playing? Hard?

[2:42:40] <%Dotta5> that's a spoon
[2:42:40] <kingbaconcrispy> You can, if the head blows up
[2:42:40] <FirearmsInstructor> @AngriestPat If you remove their head, apparently the knife is retrievable.?
[2:42:40] <DandyMackeroos> Yeah there’s a zombie fella that fills that empty outside area

[2:42:52] <Starshield1918> Cool stuff
[2:42:52] <iWBstovetop> Man, I love RE2R, but I can’t help but imagine what it would look if done in REmake style. A worse game, but possibly better looking? idk
[2:42:56] <%ElenaManetta> what's the point of pat being an old man if he's not also a veteran
[2:42:57] <%DarkLinkBJ> If you blow up the head you get back the knife
[2:42:57] <marvel877> If you kill them fast enough with a head shot, yeah.
[2:42:58] <%ElenaManetta> what the heck.

[2:43:28] <king_tubb> I mean, there ain’t no meat holding that sucker in anymore
[2:43:30] <djazo> WOW beating this game 7 times is not enough LUL
[2:43:30] <%lugraylucid> fraud detected
[2:43:33] <%spongeofmystery> Known that since 2002 apatSmug
[2:43:35] <Starshield1918> Richard
[2:43:35] <%Froyuken> Secondary fan engages.
[2:43:37] <%Erimos> This game has a surprising amount of hidden tech.
[2:43:42] <Starshield1918> Pat, you need to save Richard
[2:43:48] <Starshield1918> He might die if you do too much stuff
[2:44:01] <MurlinDurl> Ripchard
[2:44:01] <%Jolnir> apatWhat
[2:44:05] <Starshield1918> and then no cool shotgun
[2:44:08] <+PhysicsLB> Pat, save the Dick!
[2:44:09] <cant_pick_a_name> Richard doesn't trigger until his cutscene
[2:44:15] <kingbaconcrispy> There's one armor door left in the east wing second floor I think
[2:44:15] <%Froyuken> Burn bany burn.
[2:44:16] <Eye_of_Hades> one deadly zombie hype
[2:44:19] <Zaphire_Saucypants> gotta save richard in time to get that assault shotgun, right?
[2:44:19] <%peachy996> All better
[2:44:19] <rytisone> crispy
[2:44:24] <%legendscar01> Yawn?
[2:44:28] <%natebud> Richard should be fine.
[2:44:29] <Starshield1918> You can come across him already dead, can't you?
[2:44:34] <%Froyuken> Did he "fight" Yawn yet?
[2:44:37] <majima666> id laugh if the leaving the room cancelled out the burning
[2:44:40] <+DashXero> Why didn't you wait for the full burn that time?
[2:44:41] <%peachy996> Oh please don't actually waste bullets on Yawn
[2:44:43] <%natebud> It's better to clear out this area before saving Richard
[2:44:44] <%lugraylucid> apatPee
[2:44:44] <Starshield1918> Or is that not in Remake?
[2:44:48] <%manwithboxonhead> @Froyuken No
[2:44:57] <%RedMageRebel> I think RE zombies are one of the few that could actually cause an end of the world scenario, with how fucking durable they are/all the variants and BOW's. most others seem like they can be brought down easy enough after the initial infection shocks people
[2:45:05] <%Too_Much_Nukie> Pat you even pointed out "ALWAYS WAIT FOR THE FULL BURN" earlier
[2:45:05] <fusedforms> "the candlestick shines coldly in the moonlight" ok that's a bit much
[2:45:05] <djazo> Richard og VA when he dies by a shark is the funniest thing
[2:45:11] <%peachy996> You don't have to do a single thing in that Yawn fight and if you play it right you don't even have to get poisoned
[2:45:20] <%speedoduck> love your streams pat
[2:45:23] <kingbaconcrispy> Full burn doesn't matter.
[2:45:24] <MurlinDurl> idk man
[2:45:29] <FirearmsInstructor> @AngriestPat There are 5 listed kerosene cans in hard mode for Jill that I see.
[2:45:32] <trianglehat> you're the expert
[2:45:34] <%Froyuken> No idea.
[2:45:34] <%legendscar01> @AngriestPat Shoot them alive
[2:45:35] <%scaryboisupreme> dude the flamethrower sucks ASS
[2:45:35] <Starshield1918> I think it usually kills them in one shot
[2:45:36] <Peculiar_Pangolin> Fire grenade
[2:45:37] <%spongeofmystery> One fire shell works fine
[2:45:40] <%Dotta5> When the fire starts to burn, there's a lesson you must learn
[2:45:41] <%Froyuken> I last played with Chris.
[2:45:45] <%Erimos> Shoot to kill first, then use incendiary rounds.
[2:45:45] <MachineHead9> i knife them when they're on the floor save ammo :)
[2:45:46] <natebud> Never wasted ammo on floored zombies.
[2:45:46] <%lugraylucid> what difficulty is Pat on?
[2:45:47] <%scaryboisupreme> It takes forever to kill with it
[2:45:55] <marvel877> Hard mode.
[2:46:00] <DandyMackeroos> @redmagerebel Not to mention they mutate into Lickers if they’re left alone

[2:48:07] <%GeneralSCPatton> Imagine how different this would play out if the melee option was a sledgehammer. That'll solve some problems.
[2:48:08] <ECRead> patience is a virtue
[2:48:09] <%ElenaManetta> firing a fuking nuke in the house
[2:48:09] <Demonfox38> I sent that text to my dad when he got shingles.

[2:48:20] <+Ryuuken1789> The last entry of the document is genius writing.
[2:48:24] <Heyestus> How come there are no HazMat suit zombies in these games? Seems like they'd make for a good low-damage early enemy.
[2:48:25] <%Binary_Fireball> zombie fart
[2:48:26] <Eye_of_Hades> why did you waste that ammo burning zombies for a place you never come back to
[2:48:28] <FirearmsInstructor> No shit???
[2:48:28] <%RubberFistFight> I'm back, did pat die again? Kappa
[2:48:29] <AdmiralButtloaf> audio is unsynched

[2:48:39] <Starshield1918> Keeper guy might
[2:48:39] <%peachy996> This is not a hallway I use often
[2:48:39] <kingbaconcrispy> It's the guys in the windows.
[2:48:42] <Starshield1918> but not fatty
[2:48:42] <%RubberFistFight> @AdmiralButtloaf no it's not?
[2:48:43] <%Aydarkzero> @AdmiralButtloaf try refresh first
[2:48:47] <rytisone> it's Tommy Wiseau

[2:48:50] <MurlinDurl> a fuckin he never forgot
[2:48:51] <+pectusumbra> people that don't know they are turning into zombies because it's eating their brains
[2:48:53] <MachineHead9> yeah the bust through the door
[2:48:54] <FirearmsInstructor> @AngriestPat Like in a cutscene? Or are they just in the hallway? Are they unique character models?
[2:48:56] <kingbaconcrispy> No it's the guys from the windows.
[2:48:56] <+CptJackySparra> Crispy. Tasty.
[2:48:58] <+Grayhammatter> they fucked you?
[2:49:03] <%peachy996> Yea one does then one comes out into the other hallway
[2:49:03] <+DashXero> Gotta keep a record in case you don't turn into a zombie. How else will you sue?
[2:49:03] <Fujiwara_92> they came outta the room to fuck you?
[2:49:05] <FirearmsInstructor> OH THE DOOR
[2:49:06] <DandyMackeroos> Wow very vivid

[2:49:16] <Dragovus> You have no weapon equiped
[2:49:17] <%Erimos> Pat's right.
[2:49:21] <zenith0111> If I haven't seen it then it's not a real thing Kappa
[2:49:26] <%axellogic> where on the doll did they touch you
[2:49:31] <KasiCrafter> Like those differently colored objects in Hanna Barbera cartoon backgrounds.
[2:49:32] <DandyMackeroos> Jeez polygonal stuff is kinky
[2:49:34] <Zaphire_Saucypants> shotgun sheeeells
[2:49:37] <%Froyuken> Like that there's enough room to fit the whole name of the item in the item boxed.
[2:49:38] <%natebud> He's probably right, most zombies in useless rooms do that.
[2:49:42] <%SilverFaustX> apatBlep
[2:49:43] <kingbaconcrispy> But it's the guys from the windows who reset and place themselves in the hallway.
[2:49:45] <%RedMageRebel> Headcrab zombies are worst zombies; the screaming in pain even years later and as your entrails hang out your body NotLikeThis
[2:49:57] <%DarkLinkBJ> @AngriestPat It's like old cartoons where the door is a lighter color cause they are going to open it
[2:49:57] <FirearmsInstructor> @zenith0111 Doesn't exist if I didn't witness it myself haznoThink
[2:49:57] <+Grayhammatter> eyyyy
[2:50:00] <cant_pick_a_name> there's a few places where zombies go through doors
[2:50:00] <%legendscar01> The other side is a CD I believe
[2:50:09] <%Froyuken> Wait, Jill gets the shotgun?
[2:50:11] <djazo> and then they well get killed by hunters
[2:50:20] <Zaphire_Saucypants> for chriiiiiis freedom
[2:50:22] <%Froyuken> Oh right, she does.
[2:50:23] <%spongeofmystery> @RedMageRebel you ever hear what the voice clips for headcrab zombies were played without distortion?
[2:50:32] <marvel877> Yellow and Blue. The Red gem is the trap, right?
[2:50:32] <majima666> claire got so screwed over when it comes to weapons in re2
[2:50:33] <%Froyuken> It's Claire I'm thinking of.
[2:50:36] <SilverJakler> Are there spiders in this game?
[2:50:37] <%RedMageRebel> @spongeofmystery yeah it legit got under my skin
[2:50:37] <Starshield1918> Nah, I don;'t think so.
[2:50:39] <%MonsieurHedge> it's 100% been too long

[2:50:54] <SilverJakler> Okay good to know
[2:50:57] <AdmiralButtloaf> isnt it based on visits to the room?

[2:51:48] <%marsproject> When I play tense games like this I usually have to go the bathroom like a lot because of all the tenseness.
[2:51:49] <biomegabear> should this game get the RE2 treatment?

[2:51:58] <%reneries> THATS TASTY!!
[2:52:00] <%GarbageNirvana> This is an example of how good horror games thrive more off of their atmosphere and tension building than any real "OOGA BOOGA" moments

[2:53:01] <djazo> CAW CAW BITCH
[2:53:05] <ThatOneGuyYouSaw> how do the birds know if you get the puzzle wrong?
[2:53:07] <jaid251> I think you have to beat it onnormal than haed unlocks
[2:53:10] <%RedMageRebel> @GarbageNirvana true, though jumpscares work when they are used AFTER that build up. The first time I randomly ran into a licker I wasnt expecting in re2 remake got me good. plus that one female zombie stock screech they use
[2:53:16] <Mister_McDerp> birds are very smart guys
[2:53:19] <MurlinDurl> EVAIL
[2:53:20] <FirearmsInstructor> @AngriestPat Crows are FUCKING SMART

[2:53:26] <%Froyuken> Crows are intelligent and stuff.
[2:53:26] <reddpop_> birds arent real
[2:53:27] <Mister_McDerp> crows especially are smart
[2:53:27] <%legendscar01> The T virus knows
[2:53:27] <+Jasuchin> Got Jesus on my Neck-o-luss!
[2:53:29] <FirearmsInstructor> Also evil
[2:53:29] <%Gogetta159> Crows are like super smart
[2:53:31] <kingbaconcrispy> Evil. also electricity in the book.
[2:53:31] <%crimsonharvest> Birds crave chaos
[2:53:32] <%TheMattman1313> Bioweapon Crows obviously
[2:53:34] <%peachy996> Undderrated Shortcut right there
[2:53:34] <rytisone> crows designed that puzzle
[2:53:35] <MachineHead9> Crows judge the dummies LUL
[2:53:35] <+pectusumbra> crows and ravens are smart and trainable. then you find NEW METHODS OF USING THE T-VIRUS
[2:53:36] <%aishman> DEATH MASK
[2:53:39] <%natebud> Crows have very specific taste in color composition
[2:53:40] <%Froyuken> The DESU MASKU.
[2:53:40] <%MonsieurHedge> i reject my humanity, chris!
[2:53:41] <%aishman> JOOOO....JOOO
[2:53:42] <+Grayhammatter> crows are pretty smart
[2:53:42] <ittla> bark bark woof im a crow
[2:53:42] <zenith0111> Zombie Crows are even smarter Kappa
[2:53:46] <%xbalmorax> Eternal Darkness when?
[2:53:46] <Naho_Saenoki> One dude essentially trained crows to give him cash for food.
[2:53:47] <fusedforms> @Jasuchin neko-lass?
[2:53:47] <Mister_McDerp> crow > chimp
[2:53:49] <%CalderGaming> THE CROWS ARE THE CHAT

[2:53:52] <Tatrix912> Birds? The things that never existed
[2:53:52] <DandyMackeroos> Imagine how smart a T-virused crow is
[2:53:52] <Starshield1918> Yup, shotty
[2:53:54] <Judeknight> The novel explains that the birds are conditioned to attack anyone who messes up the puzzle.
[2:53:56] <+Grayhammatter> YOSH
[2:53:56] <MyNameIsRasus> Truly the Dark Souls of survival horror
[2:53:56] <zenith0111> Zombies are smarter than the average human Kappa

[2:54:02] <%walternatorz> @AngriestPat is there an explanation why the of all the intricately placed objects, the mask is just on the ground?
[2:54:02] <%marsproject> I knew there were shells there
[2:54:02] <djazo> LOGIC IN A RE GAME LUL
[2:54:04] <+Rolandknight> A shock wakes the crows up
[2:54:07] <%logoth_> Thats a good shot
[2:54:08] <MachineHead9> T-Virus destroys the brain
[2:54:10] <%natebud> Never knew these outside zombies just despawn
[2:54:11] <+Wablafarga> crows remember faces and tell other crows
[2:54:13] <+albedo455> now the brokken shotty
[2:54:19] <%Froyuken> Don't ever have to go through the east hallway nevuh evuh.
[2:54:21] <rytisone> kinky
[2:54:26] <zenith0111> @wablafarga Especially zombie crows TRUST ME
[2:54:26] <FirearmsInstructor> @Rolandknight oh shit no way, is that true? Or a guess?
[2:54:26] <cant_pick_a_name> @angriestpat show them the stair glitch run
[2:54:26] <$xiomyu> forget how do the birds know if you get the puzzle wrong? why do they care if u get it wrong
[2:54:27] <Starshield1918> :O

[2:54:33] <Starshield1918> ...Puzzle?
[2:54:34] <MurlinDurl> mjbCHAD
[2:54:37] <%Erimos> The mask collection arc is a really strong first arc.
[2:54:41] <%TheMattman1313> You're doing great Pat
[2:54:45] <%legendscar01> Goerge Trevor in there Right?
[2:54:45] <%Frostydough1> @xiomyu they are employed by UMBRELLA
[2:54:45] <%peachy996> Wanna know somethin? You run faster without a gun.
[2:54:48] <MyNameIsRasus> nice vocab sweetie
[2:54:49] <Heyestus> @AngriestPat does this game seem better than usual now that you're coming off the back of CVX?
[2:54:49] <%Gogetta159> I like to Imagine they arent T-Virus crows but just super smart ones that don't like you
[2:54:49] <FirearmsInstructor> @AngriestPat Pat brain workky speakky speakky goodie
[2:54:50] <+craftyraichu> In the book, the birds were trained to attack anyone in the room if they were shocked. The pipe the birds sat on would shock them if someone did the puzzle wrong.
[2:54:51] <%Froyuken> Nice additional arc.
[2:54:55] <cant_pick_a_name> okay
[2:54:56] <Zaphire_Saucypants> crows are smart, dude.
[2:54:56] <%peachy996> Comes in handy if you don't want to get poisoned by Yawn
[2:54:57] <Eye_of_Hades> a stone mask for every pillar man
[2:55:11] <%Froyuken> Circus to eat us route?
[2:55:12] <%spongeofmystery> I was 13 when this came out and to say its atmosphere was mind blowing is an understatement
[2:55:12] <%necrocannibal2> coward
[2:55:12] <djazo> RE part 1 stone mask LUL
[2:55:14] <+Rolandknight> @FirearmsInstructor its true.
[2:55:15] <majima666> fake fan tactics
[2:55:16] <%Dotta5> spook safety
[2:55:18] <%marsproject> Safety and ammo conservation I assume?
[2:55:19] <cant_pick_a_name> you aren't spedrunning so fuck it
[2:55:20] <+SlappyMeats> ah, the GDQ safety route
[2:55:21] <rytisone> safety dance reasons
[2:55:21] <%garatrose1> garatrose1 subscribed at Tier 1. They've subscribed for 13 months, currently on a 13 month streak! 
[2:55:22] <%Froyuken> You've been saying that a lot lately.
[2:55:26] <FirearmsInstructor> @Rolandknight awesome. :)
[2:55:27] <+MzSteele5150> The novel explains the puzzles are a defense system Umbrella used to keep people below clearance out of certain areas
[2:55:27] <%Elky3> Safety or Coward reasons @AngriestPat chariREE
[2:55:27] <MyNameIsRasus> huuuuuugs
[2:55:30] <%天使42199> apatBig COWARD
[2:55:32] <AntChodeny> how come Wesker didn't use the stone mask on himself?
[2:55:34] <%natebud> They're learning
[2:55:34] <iWBstovetop> Is REmake worse than classic in any small ways?
[2:55:35] <Fujiwara_92> Safety Dance SourPls
[2:55:38] <Starshield1918> he's still a nerd who's easy to avoid
[2:55:42] <+aversal_ammar> SAFETY DANCE
[2:55:43] <%legendscar01> The MAsk Jim Carrey
[2:55:43] <Naho_Saenoki> Crows are super smart. Some dude managed to essentially train crows to find cash, and give it to him in exchange for high-quality food.
[2:55:43] <+theAncopro> as stated earlier there's always time for safety
[2:55:45] <+CallingField> It’s ok we’re still on world record pace
[2:55:46] <+pectusumbra> Like the idea that he slowly follows you then loses you over time
[2:55:47] <SMuffinMan> Circuitouitous
[2:55:48] <Mister_McDerp> high iq zombie
[2:55:51] <kingbaconcrispy> It's especially incredible that he does that in invisible ennemy mode!
[2:55:56] <Eye_of_Hades> wesker is so the dio of this franchise
[2:55:58] <Ether101_Prime> Capcom really fucked up the Neo-Umbrella concept.
[2:55:58] <MyNameIsRasus> complete global pillarman saturation
[2:55:59] <cant_pick_a_name> there's 2 there later
[2:55:59] <%RedMageRebel> chat i gotta wake up early and help set up for an event this weekend (work at a wedding/catering hall). Do I go to bed or stay up, drink some, and watch some more RE
[2:56:00] <%Gogetta159> They put Forrest in that room in Once More and I fucking hate it
[2:56:02] <Neo_Kaiser> The analogue
[2:56:03] <Dragovus> @AngriestPat yeah he wanders around to chase you wherever he last saw you
[2:56:05] <%natebud> The voice acting is better which makes it less funny
[2:56:06] <%necrocannibal2> Pat would fuck this game if he could
[2:56:06] <%Tracazoid> I like the age puzzle over the stained glass puzzle in REmake
[2:56:07] <FirearmsInstructor> @AngriestPat No. Voice acting is MUCH better in original!
[2:56:07] <MachineHead9> @iWBstovetop maybe if you like the bad acting/ movie intro
[2:56:08] <%legendscar01> @AngriestPat Same said for RE2?
[2:56:09] <+DashXero> No option for clown farts, though.
[2:56:10] <rytisone> unless you prefer cheese
[2:56:13] <%redrins> the voice acting is arguably better in the original for how bad it is
[2:56:14] <+Qsmash_> One Flaw: REmake doesn't have the basement theme
[2:56:15] <%marsproject> How come we aren't seeing the little animated pat that dances when someone donates or subs?
[2:56:16] <%peachy996> @Gogetta159 he's the worst in this hallway
[2:56:18] <MyNameIsRasus> but i like the choese oat
[2:56:19] <majindusto> Circituitus?
[2:56:20] <%FalseEyeD> Environments are a little more cluttered and less colorful
[2:56:20] <%bread_assassin> @AngriestPat Where does the more recent remaster fit into the picture.
[2:56:26] <kingbaconcrispy> The only worse things are one or maybe two camera angles. Outside of that it's better.
[2:56:27] <%Gogetta159> Only downside of Remake is the explosive zombie mode you cant turn off
[2:56:29] <+albedo455> IT A MONSTER!!!!
[2:56:31] <lessthanhuman_tv> @legendscar01 no
[2:56:33] <artoflec> It's too earnest in this remake that it ends up being funny in a worse way
[2:56:34] <%天使42199> @legendscar01 No. Remake RE2 misses a lot of stuff with the B scenarios in the original RE2
[2:56:37] <%Froyuken> Yeah, REmake took it all serious with the VA.
[2:56:37] <%curlym0nster> is remake possibly the best remake of any video game ever tho
[2:56:38] <Zaphire_Saucypants> ehhh...between cheese and serious, I prefer serious performance.
[2:56:45] <%legendscar01> True
[2:56:55] <SirFailsAlott> @Eye_of_Hades is chris the jonathan?
[2:56:56] <djazo> funnier doesn't mean better LUL
[2:56:57] <%necrocannibal2> why would you sit on the game?
[2:57:02] <%FalseEyeD> WoolieVersus?
[2:57:02] <Peculiar_Pangolin> RE2 remake has awful boss fights
[2:57:04] <majima666> woolie versus?
[2:57:04] <cant_pick_a_name> @curlym0nster yes
[2:57:05] <MyNameIsRasus> yeah it's peachsaliva right
[2:57:06] <%Tracazoid> The Kingdom Hearts channel?
[2:57:10] <Eye_of_Hades> @SirFailsAlott holy shit yes!
[2:57:13] <zenith0111> Wait you're not Woolie?
[2:57:13] <Starshield1918> I think REmake 2 doesn't invalidate RE2 original
[2:57:17] <%legendscar01> Patrick "Resident Evil" Boivin
[2:57:19] <%Gogetta159> @Peculiar_Pangolin Repeats them too
[2:57:25] <Tatrix912> Crimson Heads are a literally game changer!
[2:57:26] <+MzSteele5150> RE2 Remake is good but there are things OG 2 did better and vice versa
[2:57:27] <Peculiar_Pangolin> True
[2:57:27] <+DashXero> TRUTH. HARD TRUTH.
[2:57:29] <Mister_McDerp> this is the peachsaliva channel right?
[2:57:33] <majima666> cant deny that
[2:57:34] <Estel013> so just to be clear, this is the remake of the very first one right?
[2:57:34] <%RubberFistFight> That fucking alligator in the sewers can go fuck itself
[2:57:35] <TriadOrion> Y'know what
[2:57:36] <cant_pick_a_name> yeah pretty much
[2:57:36] <%LiquidShake83> disc spin faster when warmed up
[2:57:38] <+kozypro> RE5 had the more fun boss fights tbh
[2:57:39] <%Erimos> Agreed.
[2:57:40] <TriadOrion> You right about crappy bosses
[2:57:43] <%scaryboisupreme> uh did pat just read donations
[2:57:43] <%RubberFistFight> frustrated the shit out of me in REmake 2
[2:57:43] <%Froyuken> Classic RE are just damage sponges basically.
[2:57:45] <%marsproject> @AngriestPat what is your favorite part of this game?
[2:57:46] <+Kaiserzelcor> Yeah the spider boss in this one is an absolute joke
[2:57:46] <%legendscar01> @AngriestPat Which one in RE 4 is best Boss?
[2:57:46] <%RedMageRebel> @Mister_McDerp no she has her own
[2:57:47] <+Grayhammatter> that game was yikes
[2:57:47] <%Too_Much_Nukie> The Wesker fight at the end of 5, the first of the 2 with the spotlights and the rpgs, was cool.
[2:57:49] <zenith0111> 5 is under rated
[2:57:51] <%Mr_Pylon> The moths were a tough ass boss though
[2:57:51] <%OldOnyx> meh, I like some of the nemesis encounters
[2:57:52] <%ElenaManetta> i saw you slide off a roof
[2:57:52] <Heyestus> @AngriestPat there's a few good bossfights in Revelaitons 2, no?
[2:57:52] <%Sausious> @AngriestPat Bakers are p good
[2:57:54] <%lugraylucid> What's your favorite boss fight Pat?
[2:57:55] <+albedo455> R2R yea till Super tyrant
[2:57:57] <%spongeofmystery> Old RE bosses are DPS races
[2:57:59] <majindusto> RE2 REMAKE IS GOOD...But misses a lot of what made RE2 what it was
[2:58:01] <Starshield1918> Wait, where are you trying to go?
[2:58:01] <+Karebuncle> its true that boss figt was ~30 seconds sand cutscenes
[2:58:03] <%curlym0nster> apatLiz_SG
[2:58:04] <ovan20> 5 is horrible
[2:58:04] <%Noelle_of_the_Nova> I really liked REmake 2's bosses....
[2:58:04] <MachineHead9> yeah i liked the og soundtrack for 2 but i like the remake better overall
[2:58:06] <+Mitchellsocks> Re3 Trolley Car Nemesis BEST BOSS
[2:58:07] <justcerebro> I'm still playing through RE2 Remake, legit my first RE game, it's p fun
[2:58:08] <marvel877> PAT DID THE OLD DICK TWIST?
[2:58:08] <%peachy996> To avoid Dog Hallway
[2:58:09] <cant_pick_a_name> you don't even have to kill the spider boss on this one
[2:58:09] <Mister_McDerp> @RedMageRebel thats the joke
[2:58:12] <%OkamiDude15> which is the best re4 boss and why is it krauser Kappa
[2:58:13] <%aeravon> What about the RE7 boss fight in the garage with the car spinning out?
[2:58:14] <+G_Thunders> But... that’s how you beat every RE final boss
[2:58:14] <djazo> the only fun boss in RE5 is wesker LUL
[2:58:15] <Ether101_Prime> Have you seen any of Whang!'s videos on the actors for the original Resident Evil?
[2:58:19] <MyNameIsRasus> at least re2make has that new ada and claire model for sfm artists
[2:58:30] <FirearmsInstructor> @Mitchellsocks PORK CHOP SANDWICHES!
[2:58:32] <%legendscar01> Damn it pat

[2:58:45] <%Gogetta159> I think Nemesis and the Tyrant in this are good. You can just sit and shoot with them
[2:58:54] <%peachy996> Free Kerosene to burn those hallway zombies I suppose

[3:00:11] <%peachy996> Fuck the lower east in general
[3:00:13] <Starshield1918> I don't think there's anything you need from that part at this point as it is
[3:00:13] <bugsmr> wait til the dogs start opening doors
[3:00:15] <marvel877> Drink some water, Pat. Or Redbull. Or Monster.
[3:00:19] <%natebud> I want a mod that replaces all enemies with eliminators, for cutscenes and gameplay.

[3:00:30] <%ElenaManetta> the dogs told you the west wing was forbidden and you went there anyway
[3:00:30] <%LiquidShake83> no, u go
[3:00:31] <Zaphire_Saucypants> @natebud oh god.
[3:00:34] <skyguy777> pet doggos next time
[3:00:36] <+CallingField> That’s dog country now
[3:00:47] <%Erimos> @marsproject i like to think the Arklay forest still has some BOWs lurking around even after RC was bombed. It'd be a cool setting for a future game.
[3:00:48] <%Gogetta159> Just waiting for Hunters to get here and wreck Pat
[3:00:48] <lessthanhuman_tv> !uptime
[3:00:49] <@Moobot> I've been playing this game for how long? Oh only 3h 50s.
[3:00:51] <Mister_McDerp> all dogs are good dogs, even the zombies
[3:00:54] <Starshield1918> THere's one down the hall too
[3:00:55] <rytisone> dogs rule girls drool
[3:01:01] <FirearmsInstructor> LOL he ate shit SUPER HARD
[3:01:02] <%legendscar01> lol
[3:01:03] <+Brojira> Go pet Doggo
[3:01:04] <majima666> yeah man, when dogs tell you somethin you listen
[3:01:04] <%peachy996> Forest is in this room too lmao
[3:01:06] <Corporate_Redeemer> @marsproject I believe that only the dogs that were already outside of the mansion either escape or die in the blast. The outbreak at Raccoon City was caused by rats getting infected with the T-Virus
[3:01:07] <%Garthunox> pat they only break through if you enter from the door you dont enter initially
[3:01:09] <%Froyuken> No light light.
[3:01:10] <%ElenaManetta> i hate these channel point alerts so much
[3:01:11] <FirearmsInstructor> like unnecessarily so!
[3:01:17] <%peachy996> it's so fucked. I love/hate One Dangerous Zombie
[3:01:22] <%starotter70> @ElenaManetta +20
[3:01:22] <%spongeofmystery> Ignore, he's replaced with a hunter later
[3:01:23] <Starshield1918> Pat, wait.
[3:01:28] <Starshield1918> You only get 3
[3:01:30] <%legendscar01> I have 6000 points
[3:01:30] <%RedMageRebel> I still dont understand this channel point stuff
[3:01:31] <%ElenaManetta> NO!
[3:01:36] <Starshield1918> I think it's 3 anyway
[3:01:37] <%Froyuken> lol Don't do eet!
[3:01:38] <Peculiar_Pangolin> 3 at least
[3:01:39] <%starotter70> @ElenaManetta +100
[3:01:49] <%marsproject> @Corporate_Redeemer So wait do they just disappear into the ether or something?
[3:01:50] <%ElenaManetta> dammit
[3:01:57] <%marsproject> The ones that escape I mean
[3:01:58] <Ran196> I thought i was only 3 if you went back through that door
[3:01:58] <%0oki> He’s going to be replaced by a hunter before he becomes crimson anyway @angriestpat
[3:02:03] <Starshield1918> I'm confident it's 3, because I had a very specific route I ran as a kid that used those 3 uses
[3:02:09] <%starotter70> Gotta make sure to hit the present box @ElenaManetta
[3:02:13] <%Jolnir> Hi pat
[3:02:15] <%XeroSigmaPrime> NO
[3:02:15] <%peachy996> Doesn't really matter, Barry will fix the door when you come back to the mansion
[3:02:15] <+Mitchellsocks> The Dark Room stairwell and that stair well are so similar
[3:02:17] <%natebud> Probably
[3:02:19] <FirearmsInstructor> @ElenaManetta I'm a wiggly-chest... WHY AREN'T YOU CLICKING ME!? STOP IGNORING ME!? D:<
[3:02:19] <%0oki> Yup
[3:02:21] <Starshield1918> Do all remaining zombies disappear once the hunters show up?
[3:02:23] <%XeroSigmaPrime> HE WILL STILL BE THERE
[3:02:25] <%0oki> Maybe
[3:02:26] <+MzSteele5150> Positive
[3:02:26] <djazo> maybe Kappa
[3:02:26] <%necrocannibal2> I'm sure, maybe
[3:02:27] <+SlappyMeats> if not, you can just have the hunter and the crimson fight each other :)
[3:02:29] <Peculiar_Pangolin> All zombies you don't kill vanish after you come back to the mansion
[3:02:30] <%Zebroneath> hoo boy, these answers
[3:02:31] <kingbaconcrispy> All zombies get replaced actually.
[3:02:32] <cant_pick_a_name> yeah it only counts if you leave not enter through the door
[3:02:32] <%FalseEyeD> One Guy
[3:02:33] <%Gogetta159> If you move fast enough slow boy
[3:02:36] <%legendscar01> @AngriestPat the first hunter is there, usually one shot kills you
[3:02:38] <FirearmsInstructor> @ElenaManetta yeah I'm compulsively clicking it to get rid of it, too
[3:02:39] <rytisone> trust that one guy
[3:02:47] <Fujiwara_92> time to trust one guy OpieOP
[3:02:52] <%0oki> You don’t have to remember the person, it’s not important Kappa
[3:02:53] <zenith0111> apatElmo Trusting chat
[3:02:54] <Mister_McDerp> GEHRMAN
[3:02:57] <%rumtumtugnutz> apatWink_TK
[3:02:58] <+Ryuuken1789> I haven't played the game so trust that guy doodBait
[3:03:00] <%XeroSigmaPrime> Zombies can disapppear, but bodies and crimson heads NEVER despawn
[3:03:01] <%patriotrenegade> @angriestpat Are ya winning, son?
[3:03:05] <chisanakitsune> You will need the lighter after you give Richard the serum though.
[3:03:06] <VritraReiRei> Gerhman is there!? PogChamp
[3:03:07] <%thegreenbenis> @AngriestPat Source: Trust me
[3:03:07] <lessthanhuman_tv> all his one guys are the same to him... he doesn't care about ius :(
[3:03:08] <Starshield1918> Go scare Barry
[3:03:09] <%spongeofmystery> @Mister_McDerp beat me to it
[3:03:10] <%legendscar01> I remember cleary
[3:03:18] <%legendscar01> Clearly
[3:03:19] <+Psyfir> The everything in this game is fucking good.
[3:03:19] <%Erimos> Tonight, Gehrman survives the horror.
[3:03:22] <Lulu19> SPOOKY AS FUCK
[3:03:23] <+reycharles75> Kreygasm
[3:03:30] <kingbaconcrispy> Bees!
[3:03:30] <Mister_McDerp> what a cool bossfight
[3:03:30] <%natebud> I just replayed this last week and I think that guy's right.
[3:03:32] <%peachy996> I miss the camera
[3:03:33] <deltakuma009> which version on re4 are you gonna play and are the ports any different for each other?
[3:03:37] <%patriotrenegade> Music is for sycophants and the products of incest.
[3:03:38] <%ElenaManetta> make out with the camera
[3:03:41] <cant_pick_a_name> NOT THE BEES
[3:03:42] <%spongeofmystery> This track is REmake in the same way that one track "Infiltration" from RE4 is
[3:03:44] <Northward12> !uptime
[3:03:44] <ittla> bring back camera angles in video games
[3:03:44] <@Moobot> I've been playing this game for how long? Oh only 3h 3m.
[3:03:46] <%legendscar01> Barry is in the other room i believe
[3:03:48] <majima666> the zeebo version
[3:03:53] <%Jolnir> ResidentSleeper
[3:03:54] <%Froyuken> UBIsoft version!?
[3:03:54] <FirearmsInstructor> @AngriestPat Why even have a case for the FAS? Just flavor?
[3:03:55] <%Too_Much_Nukie> Fucking noice.
[3:03:59] <majindusto> I'm so disappointed that Crimson Heads never came back for other games
[3:04:00] <Heyestus> Play the Toshiba Fridge version
[3:04:01] <Zaphire_Saucypants> cool
[3:04:01] <lessthanhuman_tv> Brazil version Kappa
[3:04:02] <Fujiwara_92> play the ZEEBO ONE PogChamp
[3:04:02] <%starotter70> Oh boy
[3:04:03] <djazo> RE4 HD PROJECT
[3:04:07] <rytisone> play old pc version Kappa
[3:04:08] <AdmiralButtloaf> I like that they could have just given you a spray but opening the box is more fun
[3:04:15] <%XeroSigmaPrime> THat mod works wonders for the game (but currently fucks up weapon skins a bit)
[3:04:18] <Jrocy247> >Not playing the GOAT Gamecube Version
[3:04:19] <%Maids4lyfe> yeah lickers
[3:04:20] <Starshield1918> BOO
[3:04:21] <cant_pick_a_name> gonna speedrun 4 @angriestpat?
[3:04:21] <%Froyuken> New scene.
[3:04:21] <+MzSteele5150> Wii Version best version
[3:04:22] <%spongeofmystery> SPOOPED
[3:04:24] <%marsproject> Barry doing SNEAKING SHIT
[3:04:24] <CannibulCake> danGachi
[3:04:26] <%legendscar01> Zombie final evolution is Licker
[3:04:27] <$WackyXmand> when I played this last year I found that there are too many boxes with just a health spray inside
[3:04:27] <%Elky3> rooLick ers
[3:04:27] <FirearmsInstructor> OMG I KNOW THAT BUBBLE SOUND
[3:04:28] <Peculiar_Pangolin> Lickers don't serve the same purpose as far as gameplay goes though
[3:04:29] <+unclekulikov> Awww. I thought the lickers were the orphans from RE2 that Umbrella was experimenting on.
[3:04:29] <djazo> what?
[3:04:30] <%necrocannibal2> Wii version is cheating
[3:04:30] <Starshield1918> TOo much Fizz
[3:04:31] <NaturalGear> what if they put crimson heads in RE3R? apatCrazyhead_TK
[3:04:31] <%Solidnick18> berry
[3:04:33] <%Solidnick18> why
[3:04:33] <%Too_Much_Nukie> The Wii version is the piss easy baby mode.
[3:04:35] <%walternatorz> Dwight: "F*CK"
[3:04:36] <+Psyfir> Crimson heads aren't back, but we got militia guys with guns. That's pretty much the same.
[3:04:36] <FirearmsInstructor> IT'S DIABLO 2 POTION DRINKING!! xD
[3:04:37] <chambatron> zmoking a wong
[3:04:37] <%FalseEyeD> Pooped his pants
[3:04:38] <%peachy996> Modern Zombies are as aggressive as Crimson Head imo
[3:04:38] <Zaphire_Saucypants> he was so focused on NOT being a traitor.
[3:04:38] <%starotter70> He was REALLY concentrating
[3:04:39] <chisanakitsune> They're in ORC
[3:04:41] <%ElkRiverDog> So who else has a crap ton of channel points? I’m currently sitting on 12k.
[3:04:42] <FirearmsInstructor> THE FISH TANK :D
[3:04:42] <%legendscar01> Someone is smoking
[3:04:43] <rytisone> he was thinking of sandwich
[3:04:45] <+dmtjinni> rolling fat blunt @AngriestPat
[3:04:47] <%peachy996> Oh hey F.E.A.R
[3:04:47] <DandyMackeroos> He was in deep thought
[3:04:50] <%legendscar01> NO
[3:04:50] <%huberthecockatoo> Hot take(?) I actually kinda prefer OG RE's OST to REmake's. I dunno, there's just something about it...
[3:04:52] <%Solidnick18> alma from fear
[3:04:53] <Floofiie> IS LIKE A TRUCK
[3:04:53] <Ether101_Prime> Aren't Lickers the result of exposing some one to two treatments of the T-Virus?
[3:04:54] <%segonian> according to twitch your channel is rated for "Mature Audiences." It must be the HORROR.
[3:04:55] <Floofiie> BERSERKERRRRRRRR
[3:04:58] <+StooEsq> Crimson Heads are also in RE6, but they're easy to kill if you know how to counter
[3:04:58] <%FalseEyeD> Alma Wait!
[3:05:02] <%starotter70> And pretty fucked up
[3:05:05] <Wan6Saber> sounds like something Pat would say Kappa
[3:05:05] <majindusto> But it Would have been cool to see them become Lickers
[3:05:06] <Dragovus> @AngriestPat I heard Leon's aim sucks in RE4 cause he quit smoking cold turkey just before the game starts, that's why he offers Luis gum
[3:05:06] <Zaphire_Saucypants> but I didn't care.
[3:05:07] <%ElenaManetta> i've opened the front door, put my bags down, went to the bathroom, turned on my computer, and my roommate jumped when she saw i came home because she didn't hear me. for over an hour
[3:05:07] <+BionoidLCR> i love CRACKHORNS
[3:05:09] <+Grayhammatter> CRACKhorn
[3:05:09] <majima666> martin crackhorn and i dont really care
[3:05:10] <djazo> i love that there is no logic in RE LUL
[3:05:11] <%Pat_Squared> I was just reading the wiki (which could be wrong) but it implies Lickers were a result of a different strain of T
[3:05:12] <%peachy996> Martin Crackhorn and I Don't Care
[3:05:13] <%marsproject> Martin Crackhorn and he don't care
[3:05:14] <Starshield1918> Top notch police work
[3:05:16] <%necrocannibal2> did the zombies give it away?
[3:05:17] <+SlappyMeats> yeah I'm not sure, I thought Lickers were G-virus-specific, but it would also make sense to be T-virus evolution
[3:05:20] <%Erimos> Hint hint Kappa
[3:05:22] <%0oki> I never saw that cutscene
[3:05:24] <%natebud> The RE4 HD mod doubles the length of all playthroughs, you'll have to stop and look at every texture.
[3:05:25] <%Gogetta159> Err not in my pocket Jill
[3:05:26] <FirearmsInstructor> @Floorislava Would you like some making fuck?? Berserker!
[3:05:26] <%spongeofmystery> WHO COULD THAT BE BARYY HMMMM
[3:05:28] <TalisKanju> That somebody being Barry
[3:05:28] <s1rcuit> something something Jimmy Crackhorn
[3:05:30] <Mexrage> the best thing about that HD project, is that unlike most HD texture project for games, they look "exactly" how you imagine they would look irl when first playing RE4 back on a old SD TV @AngriestPat
[3:05:32] <rytisone> THE BEE
[3:05:33] <DandyMackeroos> @huberthecockatoo It’s definitely more front and center while REmake has as a background element.
[3:05:34] <%Froyuken> I don't remember subtitles in the original release.
[3:05:35] <%legendscar01> BEEDRILL
[3:05:35] <%peachy996> Ah yes the stupid bee room
[3:05:37] <%marsproject> THE ZOMBIE BEE
[3:05:37] <%baronblank> @AngriestPat Just realized I had REmake from PS Plus for free but never downloaded it so gonna play it soon, would you say that's a good one to follow up RE2make or is there a better one? I've only played RE4 and RE2make
[3:05:38] <djazo> REALLY BARRY LUL
[3:05:39] <Rayorin> Crackhorn!
[3:05:40] <Fujiwara_92> somebody says BERRY
[3:05:43] <Stillchr> Lickers are final T-stage
[3:05:45] <+Rolandknight> fucking hate that they went with GameCube sells to say that remaking would be a bad idea for the future. Man were they wrong.
[3:05:46] <Mister_McDerp> not the BEES!
[3:05:47] <TheIronBrass> The damn bee
[3:05:47] <majima666> yeah, the original versions didnt have subtitles
[3:05:48] <%natebud> a zom bee
[3:05:48] <%necrocannibal2> OH GOD NOT THE BEES
[3:05:51] <%starotter70> I must die before the virus gets to my chemicles
[3:05:52] <FirearmsInstructor> @AngriestPat Is that fish tank making the Diabloo II potion drinking sound or am I SUPER NUTS?
[3:05:53] <KaseKaizer> bUrself
[3:05:55] <%FalseEyeD> Beeee yourself.
[3:05:55] <%Pat_Squared> Though apparently they result from the same V-ACT effect from a zombie being damaged
[3:05:58] <+SlappyMeats> there was that one double thumbprint room in RE2 that had the capsules from which lickers escaped, so that makes it seem that they were a G monster
[3:06:00] <+StooEsq> Burn it
[3:06:02] <%ElenaManetta> the lure of a bee? a bee lure? a lure that looks like a bee?
[3:06:02] <%heroicspiritavenger> Bee lure, for fishing
[3:06:06] <theredfox930000> I always wanted this to be played on the old channel a full play through at least
[3:06:09] <%XeroSigmaPrime> @Ether101_Prime Nope, theyre just further progressed azombies. A version of the crimosnhead that undergoes even more extreme mutations, though its not clear if zombies exposed to the T virus variant that creates lickers require the zombie to die before chaning
[3:06:10] <Mister_McDerp> DR. BEES
[3:06:10] <TalisKanju> The top part of that note identifies Wesker as being behind everything
[3:06:11] <%peachy996> This is around where the shitstorm episode ended I think
[3:06:14] <%ElenaManetta> are fish idiots?
[3:06:15] <Flame_Water> how can she be so calm after killing zombie dogs?
[3:06:16] <+Grayhammatter> the real beegees
[3:06:19] <%ElenaManetta> AHH

[3:06:35] <s1rcuit> stupid lazy bees
[3:06:36] <fatalDestiny> ZOM_BEEZ
[3:06:37] <%ElenaManetta> that animation of the bee getting in your face is really unsettling
[3:06:37] <%natebud> yeah that makes sense
[3:06:37] <majima666> i cant BEE-lieve it
[3:06:37] <%Pat_Squared> why did the bee come alive to attack you
[3:06:38] <%heroicspiritavenger> OH GOD IT WAS A ZOMBEE

[3:06:46] <KingOfMidgard> Good ol' Escape from Bug Mansion
[3:06:48] <Mexrage> RE2 remake doesn't have crimson heads, but zombies are so durable, that it almost feel the same, specially when they go turbo
[3:06:48] <%walternatorz> ban everyone making zombee jokes
[3:06:49] <Nina96> big videogame moment
[3:06:50] <Stillchr> When does the Mounted Deer head turn into a zombie and attack
[3:06:50] <%ElenaManetta> its all weird and robotic
[3:06:51] <%Solidnick18> beelieve it
[3:06:51] <Rayorin> wtf

[3:15:37] <Peculiar_Pangolin> No
[3:15:41] <Starshield1918> no, you can run
[3:15:41] <%Froyuken> Just get the item.
[3:15:42] <%Sausious> fight him
[3:15:42] <zenith0111> rmzGASM
[3:15:43] <%XeroSigmaPrime> you can avoid
[3:15:44] <Peculiar_Pangolin> You can get the item and run
[3:15:48] <+Rolandknight> GRAB AND GO!
[3:15:48] <%peachy996> You don't have to fight him at all
[3:15:49] <%Sausious> if you don't fight no shotty
[3:15:49] <%optimasmaximas> @GeneralSCPatton excuse me good sir what are those motes from i enjoy those series
[3:15:51] <Starshield1918> you gotta go back and get Richard's gun though
[3:15:53] <DandyMackeroos> @ether101_prime I always thought the Crmison heads were just a 1st stage to Lickers
[3:15:55] <kingbaconcrispy> Pick up the item
[3:15:55] <%legendscar01> run
[3:15:56] <djazo> i love the piano section with chris
[3:15:57] <%peachy996> Richard will down him
[3:15:57] <thetruenicster> if you run, you don't get the shotgun
[3:15:58] <Peculiar_Pangolin> But you have to wait if you want the shotgun
[3:15:59] <Zaphire_Saucypants> doesn't Richard need to sacrifice himself to get the assault shotgun?
[3:15:59] <+BionoidLCR> grab and run
[3:16:03] <kingbaconcrispy> Wait for Richard to kill him!
[3:16:05] <%Sausious> @AngriestPat if you don't fight you don;'t get the shotgun
[3:16:07] <MachineHead9> have to save richard first
[3:16:11] <+Karebuncle> If you don't kill Yawn with Richard you odnt get his shotgun
[3:16:11] <+IveGotALaserFace> if you run, you dont get shotgun
[3:16:13] <%0oki> Fight yawn or you won’t get the shotgun! @angriestpat
[3:16:14] <castlerock42> Running means no shotgun.
[3:16:14] <chisanakitsune> Shoot yawn for assault shotgun
[3:16:16] <%honeyman18> apatFist apatPat apatFist_HF
[3:16:18] <Starshield1918> no
[3:16:19] <Zaphire_Saucypants> yeah
[3:16:22] <Starshield1918> you can leave, go back, and pick it up
[3:16:25] <%PauliusMaximus> if you dont fight for at least a little you wont get the shotgun
[3:16:26] <+IveGotALaserFace> after richard dies, then you can run
[3:16:29] <%peachy996> That's wrong
[3:16:30] <kingbaconcrispy> Let Richard shoot him and wait for Yawn to die.
[3:16:30] <djazo> run and don.t get poisoned
[3:16:30] <Peculiar_Pangolin> You can let Richard shoot him
[3:16:30] <+Xalgar> any forsenE ?
[3:16:31] <%optimasmaximas> @GeneralSCPatton i found them good sir
[3:16:32] <%starotter70> Gonna get some sleep, night all! KonCha
[3:16:34] <%BingsAksolum> Doesn't Richard drop a better shotgun?
[3:16:36] <DKDiamantes> Aye Pat
[3:16:37] <%Gogetta159> Richard wont drop the gun if you just run, you have to fight till the cutscene plays then you can run
[3:16:44] <%peachy996> Richard can shoot him to trigger the cutscene
[3:16:47] <%Froyuken> Shouldn't she already have a shotty?
[3:16:57] <FirearmsInstructor> What's Richard's shotgun? A SPAS12?
[3:16:58] <%Froyuken> Or are you talking about Richards super shotgun later?
[3:16:59] <saithredsoul> Better shotgun
[3:16:59] <Zaphire_Saucypants> @Froyuken better shotty comin up
[3:17:01] <+IveGotALaserFace> its a better shotty
[3:17:02] <+reycharles75> @starotter70 night moon2LOLE
[3:17:07] <+IveGotALaserFace> 10 shots, stronger
[3:17:08] <RC_S3kshun8> oh shit badass a stream tonight!
[3:17:09] <RC_S3kshun8> !uptime
[3:17:10] <@Moobot> I've been playing this game for how long? Oh only 3h 17m.
[3:17:10] <%heroicspiritavenger> @Froyuken Assault/Entry Shotgun
[3:17:11] <cant_pick_a_name> the combat shotgun isn't worth fighting yawn for imo its kostly used to stagger anyway
[3:17:13] <MrDonTacos_> man this game is dark as shit
[3:17:13] <%GeneralSCPatton> @optimasmaximas SweetCheeksTrap and Helloween4545. Connoisseurs of the lewd.
[3:17:20] <djazo> great song
[3:17:24] <%natebud> Richard has the re4 riot shotgun
[3:17:25] <%Jolnir> apatWhat
[3:17:27] <Peculiar_Pangolin> Yes
[3:17:30] <%Chichen> agreed
[3:17:30] <%peachy996> @cant_pick_a_name it holds more rounds though
[3:17:31] <%Erimos> Absolutely.
[3:17:31] <deltakuma009> cuz he is good and he is sweet beepbeep
[3:17:31] <jadefox33445> apatJpeg
[3:17:32] <Zaphire_Saucypants> fair assessment
[3:17:32] <%Aydarkzero> feels like it
[3:17:34] <%spongeofmystery> Reasonable
[3:17:35] <Starshield1918> Not in OG RE1
[3:17:37] <RC_S3kshun8> Getting situated, etc
[3:17:43] <Starshield1918> shit hits the fan when the hunters show up
[3:17:48] <CannibulCake> danS
[3:17:49] <MachineHead9> monkaS
[3:17:51] <%optimasmaximas> @GeneralSCPatton thank you for the sauce good sir
[3:17:54] <%marsproject> That coffin is bleeding
[3:17:56] <%startadevy> kim jong milanokis
[3:17:57] <Rayorin> rock hard
[3:18:00] <Dragovus> Oh no blood on the camera
[3:18:01] <%Sausious> every RE game controls slightly different too, so you gotta Learn
[3:18:01] <%FalseEyeD> bawkSweat
[3:18:04] <%necrocannibal2> uh, that coffin is leaking
[3:18:05] <%ArtoriasTheTrenchfighter> Whack-A-Coffin
[3:18:06] <%Aydarkzero> r3make is going to be crazy at the start
[3:18:06] <%peachy996> Smooth Sailing from this point onward
[3:18:07] <%natebud> The moment you think you can put away the handgun is when the game officially becomes easy
[3:18:12] <+Mitchellsocks> In re2make, every zombie I faced before getting the shotgun felt like a massive threat
[3:18:18] <%Gogetta159> @Starshield1918 Yeah and they show up everywhere unlike in REmake where its just a few rooms
[3:18:18] <Estel013> and you have to get used to the timing of everything
[3:18:23] <Rayorin> reboner
[3:18:24] <RC_S3kshun8> Can someone explain monkaS to me? I always see people type it out and I know it was from some weird charity stream or something
[3:18:26] <%marsproject> r3make is gonna be nuts, so damn excited.
[3:18:51] <$WackyXmand> the funniest thing about this marathon is the further Pat goes into this series the less time he'll have to read chat and pet the baby
[3:18:59] <%Aydarkzero> i wonder if that first encounter will be scripted
[3:18:59] <%Brojira> Brojira subscribed at Tier 1. 
[3:19:08] <+Schiz_Turtles> @RC_S3kshun8 get BetterTwitchTV
[3:19:14] <%legendscar01> Fuck re 6
[3:19:20] <rytisone> and qte's
[3:19:21] <Starshield1918> Oh god, are you going to do the whole damn game of RE6?
[3:19:21] <SMuffinMan> RE3 is my fave, can't wait!
[3:19:23] <Jrocy247> OR Properly finish FF7
[3:19:24] <trulythedude> re6 is also trash
[3:19:26] <%Froyuken> What kinda cat is Elmo?
[3:19:27] <%Brojira> NOTICE ME SENPAI!!!!
[3:19:28] <$WackyXmand> true but some have large set pieces and such
[3:19:28] <%Gogetta159> A lot of the same cutscenes too...
[3:19:32] <FatherGreyBeard> wait you're actually doing re6?
[3:19:33] <%honeyman18> I do appreciate the massive Info dump on resident evil actually, it's been a blur till now.
[3:19:35] <+Qsmash_> RE6 is coming up? oh boy
[3:19:35] <%Erimos> RE2make was also teased in early trailers with the opening sequence, so yeah, the burning building is probably near the start.
[3:19:36] <djazo> EVERYTHING IS A QTE IN RE6
[3:19:39] <+reycharles75> re6 is so long especially chris holy christ
[3:19:39] <%Darthwaffler> Elmo is a derp
[3:19:46] <cant_pick_a_name> we're pretty much just two months out are you gonna get that far?
[3:19:46] <marvel877> Where did Pat leave off at on FF7?
[3:19:47] <RC_S3kshun8> @AngriestPat Or you could just play Metal Gear Evil : Biohazard Solid and it'll have llke 999 cutscenes.
[3:19:49] <TalisKanju> Oh god you're actually going to play RE 6
[3:19:51] <%legendscar01> Not RE 2 though
[3:19:54] <majindusto> Like you are EVER gonna actually play RE6 Kappa
[3:19:56] <%Aydarkzero> re3 looked like a lot of fun shame i never finished it
[3:19:59] <Starshield1918> It's pretty good, no RE2 or REmake, but it's cool
[3:20:02] <+SlappyMeats> yeah dude, RE3 is bomb and has sexy Nemesis slappy2Happy
[3:20:04] <%bread_assassin> You doing all routes in RE6 or are you picking one?
[3:20:05] <SMuffinMan> Built in randomizer
[3:20:08] <+oggie619> dang I liked Brad freaking out as nemesis's debue
[3:20:09] <%peachy996> You don't have to spend bullets on Yawn when Richard can eventually down him to trigger the cutscene, you pick up his shotgun and the mask and you simply leave
[3:20:14] <%Chichen> the 50% chance to get magnum or grenade launcher sucks ass for speedruns
[3:20:15] <$joylent_blue> marvel877 i wanna say end of disc 1
[3:20:17] <+Xalgar> Kappa Right way to play
[3:20:23] <RC_S3kshun8> @Schiz_Turtles but was it an emote icon that was deleted or something?
[3:20:23] <%Aydarkzero> in Pat's world variety is not the spice of life Kappa
[3:20:23] <TalisKanju> I have a friend who hates RE3 and loves CVX
[3:20:25] <+Infernal_Dalek> More like the 'reicht' way to play them, you videogame fascist :P
[3:20:30] <%Froyuken> Ouch!
[3:20:30] <rytisone> ouch
[3:20:33] <+Grayhammatter> richard!
[3:20:34] <%Aydarkzero> jeez Richard
[3:20:35] <Peculiar_Pangolin> Michael!
[3:20:37] <%legendscar01> How is he alive?
[3:20:37] <+theAncopro> you need multiple right ways
[3:20:37] <%peachy996> You can avoid getting poisoned but it's tough since Yawn almost always gets the first hit
[3:20:39] <Starshield1918> OOOWWWWJ
[3:20:40] <ovan20> no shit Jill LUL
[3:20:40] <warmnoid> killingzone

[3:21:12] <+spiceyweasle> szzyrump
[3:21:13] <Mister_McDerp> he ate the snake poison
[3:21:13] <marvel877> No, please, I have a wound there.
[3:21:16] <+Infernal_Dalek> He bit the snake!?
[3:21:16] <RC_S3kshun8> Venom - Animal Produced
[3:21:16] <+SlappyMeats> no it's poisonous, he ate the snake :)
[3:21:18] <trianglehat> maybe it was poisonous and he touched it
[3:21:19] <Starshield1918> he's Spider-man's arch nemesis
[3:21:19] <+Karebuncle> he's a fucking radio guy not a biologist lay off
[3:21:20] <RC_S3kshun8> Poison - Flora produced
[3:21:20] <djazo> STEVE I MEAN RICHARD
[3:21:20] <%Shadowpint> I pointed this out in OG 1
[3:21:21] <foreverN2dust> big in china
[3:21:22] <ShichiNoBushi> Spoilers: Richard doesn't make it.
[3:21:22] <ThatOneGuyYouSaw> I don't remember any of these guys` names
[3:21:22] <$WackyXmand> his movie sucks
[3:21:23] <Mirrorcatch> you don't know, maybe he also bit the snake
[3:21:24] <Peculiar_Pangolin> venom is injected, poison is injested
[3:21:26] <MachineHead9> venom is injected
[3:21:26] <Rayorin> no sstep on snek
[3:21:29] <TalisKanju> He has good taste, he's just wrong on CVX
[3:21:29] <+StooEsq> terrible song
[3:21:30] <kerotuyu> Venom injected
[3:21:30] <%RubberFistFight> @theAncopro "the snake bit my dick Jill, you gotta suck the venom out Kappa "
[3:21:31] <%bevyrage> venom is a symbiote in spider man and he inhabits Eddie Brock
[3:21:32] <%Aydarkzero> eat or bite?
[3:21:34] <Corporate_Redeemer> @angriestpat Will do a Randomizer playthrough?
[3:21:36] <%peachy996> So hey question. How did Richard get into the door then leave but Jill needs a key to get in?
[3:21:37] <ShichiNoBushi> What if I bite it and it likes it?
[3:21:37] <NaturalGear> is it better than Carnage tho?
[3:21:38] <%Froyuken> No it's right, shut up!
[3:21:39] <%Takreth> What if a plant is trying to eat me
[3:21:39] <+Infernal_Dalek> If it bites itself, and you're hurt, it's voodoo
[3:21:42] <+MajorCrasher> not correct
[3:21:42] <Jrocy247> What?
[3:21:43] <%Gogetta159> Like how would you even know? You can just be woozy from the wound
[3:21:44] <cant_pick_a_name> so lions are venomous?
[3:21:45] <Mister_McDerp> that distinction doesn't exist in some languages
[3:21:45] <KasiCrafter> Venom is active, poison is passive.
[3:21:45] <zamzoph> monkaS
[3:21:46] <%natebud> Have you ever tried RE7 on madhouse? It might as well be Ethan B for how much they change items and enemy spawns.
[3:21:46] <%Faustgesicht> You really gonna lecture the dying guy on somantics?
[3:21:47] <devanmuse> What if we each bite each other and nobody dies?
[3:21:48] <+Xalgar> Just don't get bit 4Head
[3:21:50] <%bevyrage> @Infernal_Dalek i'm scared
[3:21:52] <%AncelDeLambert> the animal, yeah. But then you can eat the venom and it may or may not kill you
[3:21:53] <%maskofmichael> What about the symbiote?
[3:21:55] <%marsproject> So a grizzly is venomous?
[3:21:55] <kerotuyu> What defines toxic?
[3:21:57] <trulythedude> what if I eat it and someone else dies
[3:21:57] <rytisone> bring spiderman to Richard
[3:21:58] <RC_S3kshun8> You don't know. You're playing Resi. There could be a great big fuck off dart frog somewhere
[3:21:58] <Naho_Saenoki> @devanmuse That's kinky.
[3:21:59] <%TheMattman1313> And weird black aliens: Venom!
[3:22:02] <Starshield1918> It's my third favorite RE
[3:22:02] <+MajorCrasher> It's venomous if it bites or spits at you
[3:22:05] <Lt_Campbell> how goo dis it, Pat?
[3:22:06] <%Erimos> I can't believe it.
[3:22:06] <%PauliusMaximus> it's the best
[3:22:06] <%spongeofmystery> Are there any animals that are both venomous and poisonous?
[3:22:06] <+Fracture93> tigers are poisonous because if they try and eat you, you die
[3:22:07] <%Aydarkzero> @kerotuyu Komodo dragon bites i think
[3:22:08] <+talfurt> tigers are venomous
[3:22:08] <+TossuDa> Venoisemous
[3:22:08] <worldbrand> both venoms and poisons are toxins. toxins are just deleterious substances
[3:22:09] <Starshield1918> well, maybe 4th.
[3:22:10] <+Rolandknight> it's all right
[3:22:11] <Mexrage> In spanish, veneno applies to both
[3:22:11] <%keyoray> apatBig brain Pat with the Knowledge.
[3:22:12] <majima666> platypus are fucking strange
[3:22:12] <%legendscar01> For men
[3:22:12] <+professormorrigan> its ok i guess :)
[3:22:13] <%ElenaManetta> VERY cool.
[3:22:14] <$WackyXmand> i only played this last year and yeah it's pretty good
[3:22:15] <+Fracture93> @talfurt same brains
[3:22:16] <%marsproject> Only the COOLEST kids.
[3:22:16] <+Karebuncle> You but what if yawn IS poisonous and he got poisoned by the scales not the bites
[3:22:17] <%maskofmichael> I'm a cool child
[3:22:18] <%crimsonharvest> snake venom is too large a molecule to be absorbed through mucus membranes and is destroyed by digestion
[3:22:18] <adjothetiger> but what if it bites you and neither of you die @angriestpat
[3:22:19] <+SlappyMeats> it's noxious if it farts on you before it eats you

[3:22:30] <Starshield1918> Pat, quick question: Remake or REmake 2?
[3:22:30] <%peachy996> Not for children but we all played RE when we were kids
[3:22:31] <zamzoph> @AngriestPat Do you recommend original over REMake first for someobody who has played neither?
[3:22:31] <+talfurt> @Fracture93 lol yeah
[3:22:32] <%Aydarkzero> Serum get
[3:22:32] <%Froyuken> READ THE BOTTLE!
[3:22:33] <kerotuyu> @Aydarkzero Specifically?
[3:22:33] <%天使42199> so if someone tries to kill you with a poison knife are they venoming you or poisoning you to death???

[3:22:33] <+Doggyperro> too bad people dont want fixed camera angle games anymore
[3:22:37] <%XeroSigmaPrime> DO IT
[3:22:39] <+Arrior_Septem> What about toxic?
[3:22:41] <%huberthecockatoo> @majindusto it's actually Joe Whyte, the same VA as Chris in this game.
[3:22:42] <shiny_prinny> toxic is like poison from man-made things
[3:22:46] <$joylent_blue> max did it pvpSass
[3:22:46] <KenzBurp> what if i bite it and it dies
[3:22:47] <%natebud> I feel like that's something to do at the end of all this
[3:22:49] <%Aydarkzero> @kerotuyu i guess more bacteria than toxic

[3:30:17] <Zaphire_Saucypants> the locker, the locker, gotta open the locker.
[3:30:19] <%spongeofmystery> @leinadtonu when you obsessively need to make all the map rooms green instead of red when you're 14 years old, this stuff tends to get stuck in your head forever
[3:30:20] <%天使42199> @lessthanhuman_tv kirby with a HUGE CAWK
[3:30:23] <zenith0111> apatElmo <3
[3:30:28] <%RedMageRebel> so chris's run has to be canon cause rebecca survived right? I dont think she shows up at all in this if you're Jill
[3:30:32] <%Shackle_Rustyford> george says this is the best game ever made
[3:30:35] <foreverN2dust> apatWink_TK
[3:30:37] <DandyMackeroos> I love that RE:Deadly Silence lets you skip those transitions.
[3:30:41] <%DazzlingFuhrer> I interpreted it as Kirby AS a huge cock.
[3:30:42] <%FalseEyeD> the runs are all kinda canon
[3:30:44] <Mister_McDerp> MAGNUM DONG KIRBY
[3:30:50] <%TheSphereHunter> I was wondering why you had an almost empty inventory but every item in the mansion is in your item box
[3:30:50] <%XeroSigmaPrime> @RedMageRebel But what about Barry then?! Technically neither is canon
[3:30:59] <DandyMackeroos> Plus cheesy RE4 Knife tech
[3:30:59] <ThatOneGuyYouSaw> @redmagerebel both are canon
[3:31:00] <%FalseEyeD> Everything is canon in RE
[3:31:00] <%PauliusMaximus> theres also an achievement for getting all the items
[3:31:00] <%RedMageRebel> ah shit you right
[3:31:01] <%GraceTBM> GraceTBM subscribed at Tier 1. They've subscribed for 13 months! Just played the full release of Black Mesa! It's really good. At first I jacked up the mouse sensitivity cause I couldn't look around quickly, and even almost bought a new mousepad before realizing the mouse needed a battery change
[3:31:01] <%Chichen> same
[3:31:03] <Zaphire_Saucypants> me too
[3:31:05] <Zaphire_Saucypants> hated it
[3:31:06] <kingbaconcrispy> @RedMageRebel Both are canons do to them being mutually exclusive. Like Barry lives but dies in Chri's scenario.
[3:31:07] <MachineHead9> Yeah Rebecca, Jill, Chris, and Barry survive the mansion
[3:31:07] <%OkamiDude15> jill valentine what a MANISION
[3:31:07] <+krawtch> but ass, tho
[3:31:08] <oniwahoo> Chat is still not to be trusted
[3:31:09] <+SlappyMeats> Chill Valentine
[3:31:09] <zamzoph> When they just made her Nina Williams?
[3:31:10] <%legendscar01> And sexy
[3:31:10] <%peachy996> Where she turns into Nina Williams
[3:31:11] <zenith0111> Right?`
[3:31:13] <%GraceTBM> It was made to cater to 14 year old boys
[3:31:13] <%Aydarkzero> yeah she turned into a Bird Kappa
[3:31:16] <Zaphire_Saucypants> fuckin blonde....
[3:31:17] <zenith0111> Blonde DansGame
[3:31:18] <+arancet> not just bad design, they treated her char like shit too
[3:31:19] <%GraceTBM> not even 16 year olds
[3:31:19] <+SpoonlessAlakazam> myega correct
[3:31:19] <%peachy996> I also hate it
[3:31:19] <+TossuDa> RE5 Jill sucks across the board
[3:31:20] <%natebud> I hope we never see it again
[3:31:20] <+DiabloDeAzul> a totally spies knockoff
[3:31:20] <nademonkey1100> yea it was pretty bad
[3:31:22] <%Zebroneath> Her face wasn't too great in Revelations as well
[3:31:22] <%天使42199> re5 made her like a fake nina from tekken
[3:31:22] <%wbo2> re5 didnt happen and neither did any numbers after
[3:31:22] <rytisone> Wesker dyed her hair
[3:31:23] <SchroedingersFerret> Her bimbo transformation
[3:31:23] <kingbaconcrispy> She became lame after RE3
[3:31:23] <majima666> re5 should have just been jill and chris. not that sheva was bad or anything though
[3:31:24] <%XeroSigmaPrime> Her Lodt In Nightmares BSAA costume was fucking awesome tho
[3:31:24] <%Froyuken> They redeemed themselves in Revalaitons.
[3:31:25] <+arancet> turned into some kinda ninja
[3:31:26] <DandyMackeroos> Then they changed it
[3:31:26] <Starshield1918> Jill's likability didn't really survive Resident Evil turning into an anime
[3:31:27] <+reycharles75> yea
[3:31:29] <%RedMageRebel> hopefully 8 gives her something to work with
[3:31:30] <%Mr_Pylon> Is Revelations 1 worth taking a shot at?
[3:31:31] <+Demerson13> Her designed peaked in Revelaitons
[3:31:31] <lessthanhuman_tv> @dazzlingfuhrer I mean it makes sense. imagine if Kirby sucked a dick? if the rules of the universe apply, he would turn into a dick.
[3:31:32] <cant_pick_a_name> invisible enemy run when @angriestpat
[3:31:34] <zenith0111> Omg she does xD
[3:31:34] <+craftyraichu> Why did Wesker make her blonde....
[3:31:36] <+pectusumbra> The wesker brainwashing transformation.
[3:31:36] <%peachy996> Everyone knows Anna Williams is the true best girl
[3:31:37] <Mister_McDerp> canon bimbo transformation?
[3:31:38] <+Doggyperro> at least she didnt become a roid monster like chris
[3:31:40] <%FalseEyeD> Yeah, BSAA costume was cool
[3:31:40] <%TwinBat> butthurt
[3:31:40] <%Chichen> get stronger butt
[3:31:40] <%Elky3> here Revalations desgin was amazing rooGasm
[3:31:42] <%Tracazoid> The Plague Doctor mask outfit she had over her battle suit was cool as hell though.
[3:31:42] <%RedMageRebel> Also bring back claire Capcom, you cowards
[3:31:43] <$WackyXmand> won't defend the design but it was slightly improved in MvC3
[3:31:43] <%marsproject> Pat needs his butt rubbed
[3:31:44] <%aishman> I find it funny that Max absolutely adores that re-design in RE5 while you absolutely hate it.
[3:31:44] <%Elky3> her*
[3:31:44] <+krawtch> the crater bites back
[3:31:47] <%peachy996> At least of the Williams sisters
[3:31:47] <%RedMageRebel> no rev 2 wasnt enough
[3:31:50] <Tatrix912> Just wait for Kirby!
[3:31:50] <Ether101_Prime> Maybe she's actually shitter Samus Aran.
[3:31:52] <%necrocannibal2> @AngriestPat why does every RE character looks completely different in each game tho? I hate that
[3:31:52] <MachineHead9> i heard revelations was underrated
[3:31:53] <FirearmsInstructor> @Mister_McDerp Wait what?
[3:31:53] <%XeroSigmaPrime> the RE5 BSAA costume was fucking awesome tho for her
[3:31:54] <+pectusumbra> A NEW METHOD OF USING THE T-VIRUS, making submissive blonde assassin sex slaves

[3:33:26] <$Jmann1892> Tube Top and Minskirt is objectively the best RE costume
[3:33:26] <+SlappyMeats> my only issue with the miniskirt is that it's fuckin' the end of September in the midwest; it gets chilly
[3:33:28] <%0oki> My favorite costume is her re5 mansion one
[3:33:29] <Tatrix912> Nemesis with a HAT on top of his MASK!!
[3:33:30] <+Estuko> There's a Left 4 Dead mod level that's basically the run of the Resident Evil 1 game even the small puzzles too. It's really cool

[3:34:07] <%RubberFistFight> @Shadowpint Bloodhound Gang had a song about that. "I need to find a, new vagina, any kinda, new vagina. It's hard to rhyme a, word like vagina. Calvin Klein kinda, NORTH CAROLINA!"
[3:34:12] <%necrocannibal2> @AngriestPat that's not how Regina is pronounced Pat, wtf

[3:34:36] <%natebud> I would preorder re3 right now if it gave claire a hat
[3:34:36] <lessthanhuman_tv> Pat how dare you not address how you just said Ragina
[3:34:37] <%FalseEyeD> Knife only RE2 run when?
[3:34:37] <%Erimos> @SlappyMeats as someone who lives in the midwest, it's accurate. We don't give a fuck about the cold. We'll wear skirts and shorts in november.
[3:34:38] <oniwahoo> I forgot what happened to Jessica
[3:34:39] <majima666> hats mod when?
[3:34:39] <foreverN2dust> thank you

[3:35:34] <%peachy996> by breaking down the door

[3:36:41] <+krawtch> it probably triggers Crimson Head transformations
[3:36:42] <Ether101_Prime> @MachineHead9 So many people already knew at that point so it was a needless risk to kill an entire family.

[3:43:15] <Ether101_Prime> Capcom sure did mess up the Neo-Umbrella idea, huh? First it was a group that Wesker was building in RE4, then they forgot about it, then it was a group that splintered from the Family lead by Carla for some reason then there's Blue Umbrella that's supposed to be created from the people that rebelled against the companies true nature which is what the BSAA was supposed to be.
[3:43:16] <foreverN2dust> didn't *pat

[3:48:27] <%ElenaManetta> Cause they use their teeth to grab you
[3:48:27] <%peachy996> Yawn always gets the cheap first hit
[3:48:28] <%Aydarkzero> she said that in the most uncaring way
[3:48:28] <Zaphire_Saucypants> ooooh I neeeed dat serum.

[3:48:46] <s1rcuit> @AngriestPat how do you learn the snake's name is Yawn?

[3:49:12] <%Froyuken> OG RE to NO ONE! "Give me some serum...."
[3:49:13] <%RedMageRebel> I still need to get back into the base game, I'm so behind/bad at Monster Hunter but wanna git gud
[3:49:13] <%marsproject> Why did they call it Yawn?
[3:49:13] <deviljhojho_> half of you guys werent even alive then
[3:49:14] <Neo_Kaiser> When you're poisoned, the controls should be reversed.
[3:49:14] <%Tearonex> @AngriestPat What did you think of the final boss?
[3:49:15] <%Erimos> I suppose you could technically play the game permanently poisoned, if you wanted the challenge.
[3:49:17] <%peachy996> @TalisKanju he does
[3:49:17] <%necrocannibal2> and your "magazines"
[3:49:18] <Estel013> we love a good nerd moment
[3:49:20] <%Pat_Squared> there is also a slideshow later that I think verifies it
[3:49:20] <%Gogetta159> Isnt it on the projector in the lab?
[3:49:21] <$bootysteve> Tips and tricks magazine FeelsStrongMan
[3:49:23] <%cdrom321> That's like finding out Mr. X's name from the action figure.
[3:49:23] <+jorgamund> @AngriestPat what's a "magazine"?
[3:49:28] <fearhurst> okay boomah
[3:49:29] <DandyMackeroos> @aydarkzero They get really repetitive.
[3:49:29] <%OldOnyx> oh, god, tips and tricks
[3:49:34] <DandyMackeroos> So yeah
[3:49:35] <Manwad> it looks like it's yawning before you get vored

[3:49:40] <ryankr2> @cdrom321 yeah kind of
[3:49:40] <Oxybe> man.... Tips & Tricks. that's a blast from the past.
[3:49:45] <%Froyuken> Does Barry show up if you didn't save Richard?
[3:49:46] <%Erimos> Ceadeus is a cool fight tho
[3:49:47] <deviljhojho_> Die Morales
[3:49:48] <$bootysteve> Pencil Puzzles :(
[3:49:48] <%Aydarkzero> it's a good fight but kind of annoying for SnS
[3:49:48] <+BootyFriend> Pat's not gonna be streaming Iceborne is he?
[3:49:49] <foreverN2dust> it looks incredible
[3:49:49] <NaturalGear> can't believe 96 was a millennia ago
[3:49:50] <MaraSmug> It the most terrifying monster in the game
[3:49:51] <+Navekraith> uptime!
[3:49:51] <%Iccirrus> Not better than Alatreon though
[3:49:52] <%GeneralSCPatton> @jorgamund It's something they had back before the Death Stranding
[3:49:52] <RC_S3kshun8> these fucking monster names man
[3:49:53] <%necrocannibal2> are you speaking tongues?
[3:49:54] <%Owkono> I'm pretty sure its name is Vore
[3:49:54] <%Sausious> these are all fake words
[3:49:55] <%DazzlingFuhrer> Ceadeus is an awful fight.
[3:49:55] <%Iccirrus> Alatreon is the shit
[3:49:58] <Fujiwara_92> those aren't words
[3:49:58] <%leinadtonu> die Morales...
[3:49:58] <youlookokgetin> you just made half of those names up
[3:50:00] <RC_S3kshun8> Makes people sound like they're having strokes
[3:50:00] <%peachy996> gabba gool
[3:50:00] <Mister_McDerp> that sounded like gibberish
[3:50:02] <Quikanims> hey @AngriestPat i was born in 1996, and i am now 23 years old. How does that feel?
[3:50:04] <%RedMageRebel> *insert good burger gif* I know some of these words

[3:50:04] <%rosabellamelantha> >better than gogmazios

[3:50:09] <%Typhaeon> Man it's been so long since Tri
[3:50:09] <smugjorgen98> what about MHW vanilla final boss
[3:50:09] <TheTrueZyozz> I'mma go off if keep hearing vore.
[3:50:11] <%xxinevitablexii> He's speaking in tongues, call an excorcist
[3:50:14] <%maskofmichael> I don't understand ANYTHING you just said
[3:50:16] <%natebud> Dr. Zeus is a horrible final boss
[3:50:19] <%Darthwaffler> I like ol' shovel face
[3:50:23] <%Aydarkzero> these are real words chat!
[3:50:25] <rhus> idk anything about mon hun, those COULD be omikron names for all I know
[3:50:26] <%LiveStreamOnyx> WHAT ARE YOU SAYING lorNANI
[3:50:28] <%rosabellamelantha> @AngriestPat you're allowed your opinions but gogmazios is amazing, also you missed Atal
[3:50:32] <%Erimos> Then again I'm one of like 5% of players that liked the underwater combat.
[3:50:34] <%legendscar01> The power of Christ Compels you
[3:50:39] <DandyMackeroos> I sunk a lot of hours into Mon Hun but I have recollection over those names.
[3:50:44] <+dmtjinni> apatBlep
[3:50:45] <MachineHead9> MH3 OST is the best one
[3:50:46] <3rdwarrior> Viper Tobi is a miserable fight
[3:50:49] <$joylent_blue> haven't played older monhun games, but Gore Magala is an awesome name
[3:50:52] <DandyMackeroos> I mean none
[3:50:52] <Neo_Kaiser> First time I played this the game glitched out and the serum didn't exist. I couldn't pick it up at all.
[3:50:56] <%Aydarkzero> i started MH with World so still kind of new compared to Pat
[3:50:56] <+pectusumbra> I missed some shit apparently
[3:51:02] <%peachy996> Grenade wouldn't hurt
[3:51:03] <$WackyXmand> @AngriestPat Uncomfirmed detail: people have said that it's eyes don't follow the character but your camera instead like it's looking at you the player
[3:51:07] <%spongeofmystery> Zombies can have a little grenade, as a treat
[3:51:07] <smugjorgen98> viper tobi is fiiiiiine
[3:51:09] <GoDZooKii> Oh God i forgot the underwater shit combat.
[3:51:13] <Zaphire_Saucypants> just a lil nade.
[3:51:16] <+dmtjinni> enbSwoleL apatBlep enbSwoleR
[3:51:18] <%Typhaeon> I noticed that when I was fighting it like 20 minutes ago
[3:51:19] <warmnoid> can't wait for underwater combat in MH6 so i can swim with my friend lagiacrus
[3:51:19] <%Gogetta159> I always forget what the next boss is called, I always call him Super Crimson Head
[3:51:25] <%Aydarkzero> it's watching the actual player
[3:51:25] <Mister_McDerp> monkaS
[3:51:31] <3rdwarrior> viper is annoying
[3:51:32] <%Monkeyweed21> is true
[3:51:35] <%Faustgesicht> I liked the Dahren Moran fight
[3:51:37] <%Typhaeon> Got around half the set made, it's dope
[3:51:38] <%natebud> Wonder if that's a oversight
[3:51:39] <Tucker0603> @AngriestPat yes that's correct, makes it so unnerving and i love it
[3:51:42] <%IMDRanged> Forth Wall breakage
[3:51:43] <nitro4life2> Nah, it looks at your Soul
[3:51:43] <$WackyXmand> yeah they made it really quite scary
[3:51:46] <+pectusumbra> What I missed Snek fight?
[3:51:46] <+OrochiTabris> I always liked the underwater stuff in MH >.> was sad when they got rid of it
[3:51:49] <Zaphire_Saucypants> Prototyle Crimson Head
[3:51:49] <$joylent_blue> just slap some poison resist on and viper tobi is nothing
[3:51:54] <%Aydarkzero> too bad i found it's weapon and armor sets useless for me...
[3:51:54] <trianglehat> big ol zombo
[3:51:56] <+MrMcCrabby> he's cool but trying to get that double head break is a bitch
[3:51:57] <%legendscar01> Its George Trevor I believe in the Crypt
[3:51:57] <Zaphire_Saucypants> *Prototype
[3:52:03] <deltakuma009> so did the pc port of iceborn really kill peoples power?
[3:52:03] <smugjorgen98> I need to farm in FF14 and MHW ice borne what do I do chat
[3:52:04] <Oxybe> grenades are the candy that keeps on gibbin'
[3:52:06] <%Darthwaffler> Viper Toby isn't that bad, just negate poison and stun
[3:52:07] <%DazzlingFuhrer> Ditching underwater combat forever was one of the best decisions they ever made for MH.
[3:52:08] <Rayorin> @nitro4life2 your nomad soul?
[3:52:08] <%Aydarkzero> @legendscar01 man that's messed up
[3:52:08] <%Typhaeon> That greatsword is amazing
[3:52:09] <+pectusumbra> I thought it was spencer in the crypt
[3:52:09] <%Froyuken> Was the camera detail about RE or MH?
[3:52:13] <%trekkie11041> @Gogetta159 Crimson Head Prototype 1
[3:52:15] <%OldOnyx> apatWink
[3:52:16] <%Typhaeon> In terms of looks at least
[3:52:27] <Corporate_Redeemer> @angriestpat Thoughts on R3make's Hunters? Think we might see more than one Hunter type? Such as Gammas and whatnot?
[3:52:27] <%manwithboxonhead> @gogetta159 Deep within the Umbrella Archives if it’s vilest test subject, it is code named “some guy in a coffin”.
[3:52:33] <%Aydarkzero> i need to get me a backup battery
[3:52:34] <Neo_Kaiser> Backup battery?
[3:52:35] <cheezbass> what how?
[3:52:35] <FirearmsInstructor> Wait WHAT???
[3:52:36] <%legendscar01> Resident Evil
[3:52:36] <%Monkeyweed21> people have datamined shara's model and found a bunch of crazy details regarding his eyes
[3:52:37] <Mister_McDerp> damn
[3:52:38] <ittla> iceborne was unplayable for me until days after the release
[3:52:39] <3rdwarrior> switch axe feels so slow when viper is moving and flying all over the place
[3:52:39] <%necrocannibal2> what?
[3:52:40] <$WackyXmand> @Froyuken MH, final boss of Iceborne
[3:52:41] <SirFailsAlott> whoa what the fuck how
[3:52:43] <VeryTricky> like power supply?
[3:52:43] <cheezbass> how does a game take more power???
[3:52:45] <majima666> now you're playing with power....literally
[3:52:47] <ThisGamingDragon> Elmo made a noise
[3:52:48] <ittla> and i had to CHEAT to make iceborne finally work well
[3:52:49] <%natebud> The death toll from PC Iceborne is still about 7
[3:52:50] <%Typhaeon> It made Windows Defender antimalware consume around 16 GB of RAM until I added an exclusion to the MHW program folder
[3:52:50] <Viperwing999> jesus dude just buy a power plant
[3:52:52] <FirearmsInstructor> @AngriestPat A video game pulled so many amps it fucked your electricity??
[3:52:55] <Neo_Kaiser> Virgil takes up more power
[3:52:55] <%legendscar01> George Trevor rises
[3:53:01] <%Froyuken> Time to fight papa.
[3:53:06] <%天使42199> wtf.... ??? how does a game fuck up your power ???
[3:53:07] <%RubberFistFight> @AngriestPat were you running it on the mains passthrough or directly off the battery itself? o_O
[3:53:10] <Ether101_Prime> Isn't it crazy that The Horus Hearsay is over 50 books?
[3:53:17] <Neo_Kaiser> How much money does Pat have?
[3:53:17] <GoDZooKii> My friend said it used 99% of his CPU
[3:53:22] <%Monkeyweed21> Excited for Rajang in a few weeks?
[3:53:26] <%Aydarkzero> watch out he has a beard!

[3:53:50] <majima666> thats nothing jill was taking rockets to the face like a fucking champ
[3:53:52] <smugjorgen98> MHW iceborne PC version has a second anti-cheat going on the backround while you play it on top of MHW vanilla anti-cheat
[3:53:53] <twindle07> the crossup
[3:53:54] <DandyMackeroos> Wow it doesn’t matter cause he’s dead in moments
[3:53:54] <%theotherkristian> Goodnight patman and company
[3:53:55] <%logoth_> He's the Ultimate Bio Weapon
[3:53:56] <%天使42199> @manwithboxonhead anthem LUL
[3:53:57] <ittla> yeah but what if an actual vampire came out of the coffin tho
[3:54:00] <+dark_kebabs> knifing this bitch is annoying af
[3:54:02] <RC_S3kshun8> I liked the lore logic where Zambo - age - > Crimson Head - age - > Licker is that still canon? @AngriestPat
[3:54:04] <BooitsDock> my right ear love this
[3:54:05] <%cdrom321> Can you get the knife back?
[3:54:17] <TalisKanju> How does that switch even work?
[3:54:20] <D3rrtyD4n> nope
[3:54:23] <cant_pick_a_name> *has spacious room to dispatch enemy in* let's stand right next to him
[3:54:27] <%xxinevitablexii> thats just umbrella tho
[3:54:28] <GoDZooKii> Licker lore is still canon
[3:54:31] <%legendscar01> Ins't there a file in the coffin
[3:54:31] <%Froyuken> Guardhouse time.
[3:54:38] <%natebud> what switch? I didn't see a switch
[3:54:39] <%Aydarkzero> i don't think he was moving
[3:54:39] <%OldOnyx> did pat ever play the randomizer on stream?
[3:54:40] <%Froyuken> Or Lisa's cabin.
[3:54:41] <Estel013> zombie magic
[3:54:42] <All_Salt> I've been looking at getting a UPS, what brand should I lean towards?
[3:54:52] <FirearmsInstructor> What the fuck is "TEM TEM"??
[3:54:53] <trianglehat> guardhouse gang
[3:54:53] <Zaphire_Saucypants> guy ahead
[3:54:55] <%Erimos> I like the guardhouse.
[3:54:56] <%DazzlingFuhrer> The one with the black vans.
[3:54:58] <TalisKanju> It's called the "Residence" in this game
[3:55:00] <%xxinevitablexii> fedex
[3:55:01] <%Froyuken> And the ring is an actual ring.
[3:55:02] <%spongeofmystery> But big spiders thoug
[3:55:03] <%ElenaManetta> are we in the antarctic yet?!
[3:55:04] <ryankr2> Does anybody know if the switch port of this game is any good
[3:55:04] <%Aydarkzero> @All_Salt do you mean psu?

[3:55:19] <GoDZooKii> Temtem? You mean better pokemon?
[3:55:25] <%cdrom321> @Aydarkzero No. Uninteruptable power supply.
[3:55:25] <+pectusumbra> @FirearmsInstructor indie pokemon game that already looks better than actual pokemon despite being in alpha/early access
[3:55:25] <cant_pick_a_name> more like aqua corridor
[3:55:28] <%rumtumtugnutz> apatWink_TK HypeUnicorn4 HypeUnicorn4 HypeUnicorn4 HypeOni5
[3:55:31] <RC_S3kshun8> Excuse me sir, this is the Residence of Malice. Not 'Resident Evil'.
[3:55:37] <+FellowOfInfiniteJest> it has sing in the description you mf
[3:55:38] <%ElenaManetta> does anyone else think of jackie chan when they see those talisman
[3:55:40] <FirearmsInstructor> @pectusumbra heh cool ty :)
[3:55:40] <All_Salt> @Aydarkzero I think so? Uninterrupted Power Supply?
[3:55:40] <%Aydarkzero> @cdrom321 huh haven't heard of that one
[3:55:42] <$WackyXmand> it's almost as if this game has a Residence in it?
[3:55:44] <%FalseEyeD> This game is less than $8 on PC
[3:55:47] <%xxinevitablexii> Yes
[3:55:51] <Zaphire_Saucypants> no burny?
[3:55:59] <%Erimos> @ryankr2 if you can tolerate the extra 2-3 seconds per room transition it's a serviceable port.
[3:56:02] <D3rrtyD4n> wat PogChamp
[3:56:04] <%Typhaeon> Uninterruptible Power Supply
[3:56:08] <%Aydarkzero> @All_Salt no i haven't heard of that one sorry

[3:56:29] <%natebud> @ElenaManetta Ai-ya jackie
[3:56:33] <%ElenaManetta> i heard a monkey
[3:56:33] <RC_S3kshun8> Come to think of it 'Residence of Malevolence' works better
[3:56:34] <$WackyXmand> borf breaker
[3:56:34] <Jrocy247> JESUS
[3:56:36] <%xxinevitablexii> one more thing

[3:56:46] <Mister_McDerp> jermaPluto poor doggo
[3:56:46] <TheTrueZyozz> @ElenaManetta, he's died 3 or 4 times already in this.
[3:56:51] <Wan6Saber> nice
[3:56:51] <%Sausious> it's stronger and holds mroe bullets
[3:56:56] <%spongeofmystery> IN CHAINS
[3:56:58] <%natebud> maybe there was an eliminator riding it

[3:57:10] <rytisone> famous last words
[3:57:11] <+teambucky> Hey Pat ! have you watched Resident Evil Vendetta Yet.
[3:57:12] <+pectusumbra> So this is plant zone right?
[3:57:18] <%legendscar01> That's leon's shotgun from the castle
[3:57:19] <Corporate_Redeemer> DEATH COUNT IS AT 4
[3:57:19] <%Sausious> this was where i stopped using the handgun and switched to the shotty the rest of the game\
[3:57:20] <%Aydarkzero> Boss Fountain
[3:57:21] <%natebud> When you put the handgun away for good
[3:57:22] <smugjorgen98> is RE0 after this?
[3:57:24] <Zaphire_Saucypants> time for magnum
[3:57:27] <%Froyuken> 2002.
[3:57:28] <%cdrom321> @Aydarkzero Pat talked about it recently because there was a game that would strain his hardware for no good reason and max out the power draw to the point in which, when the power went out, the UPS wasn't able to keep his computer from shutting down.
[3:57:30] <DandyMackeroos> A little bit of a shooting gallery?
[3:57:32] <%Typhaeon> Ooooh
[3:57:35] <%peachy996> Destrection and....
[3:57:44] <%legendscar01> Haunted Forest
[3:57:46] <TheTrueZyozz> FUCK! @AngriestPat, my Boston Cream donut is stuck to the bag!!!

[3:57:52] <Mister_McDerp> CAVE OF HATRED
[3:57:54] <%Typhaeon> Why is this game still so good all these years later
[3:57:54] <Ner234> What are there names LUL
[3:57:55] <%peachy996> Destruction and Revenge I think
[3:57:57] <%Froyuken> Will he get the magnum, though.
[3:57:57] <%FalseEyeD> @firearmsinstructor They sell steam keys
[3:57:57] <%Erimos> This forest is DANGEROUS
[3:58:01] <%cdrom321> Pat, What UPS do you use?
[3:58:03] <+dustingunn> @AngriestPat they misspelled destruction
[3:58:05] <trianglehat> the Devil's Pit
[3:58:06] <%manwithboxonhead> It can get comfortable but don’t get too sloppy.
[3:58:06] <%Aydarkzero> @cdrom321 yeah i always thought it was just called back up batteries just looked it up on Microcenter they look really useful
[3:58:08] <%necrocannibal2> WAIT

[3:58:24] <Zaphire_Saucypants> oh gee whiz, you guys.
[3:58:26] <@commanderclaw> This lady is one of the creepiest things ever in a game
[3:58:28] <+landcollector11> Be afraid, there's a forest all around you
[3:58:32] <+FellowOfInfiniteJest> I saw Forrest outside the mansion!
[3:58:34] <TheTrueZyozz> MY DONUT!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! TIMMIES, WHAT HAVE YOU DONE!!!

[3:58:42] <%ElenaManetta> but wait a minute... if you're here, and i'm there, that means the monster is...
[3:58:44] <%cdrom321> Did he say the UPS he has is 510 watts?
[3:58:44] <DandyMackeroos> I got my butt smacked by a lady says Barry
[3:58:47] <%legendscar01> West?
[3:58:50] <+storkeylope> He even has a gun that’s effective, especially against living things!
[3:58:56] <%Aydarkzero> @cdrom321 i believe so
[3:59:03] <+SpoonlessAlakazam> @cdrom321 I believe he said he went from 510 to 900
[3:59:10] <%ArtoriasTheTrenchfighter> This forest is like a sharpened ham-bone, it's got that Hammy Edge.
[3:59:22] <%Erimos> Shut up, it's super locked.
[3:59:24] <%xxinevitablexii> hahah
[3:59:27] <Zaphire_Saucypants> magnuuuum

[3:59:43] <%peachy996> Nevermind
[3:59:44] <eviljake9> it's locked in a kind of open position
[3:59:45] <MachineHead9> Earth!
[3:59:45] <$WackyXmand> don't check phone when dirty chickens are near by
[3:59:49] <Zaphire_Saucypants> nah, you can do it one by one
[3:59:55] <%Aydarkzero> three?
[3:59:56] <%logoth_> Why would nature conspire against man like this
[3:59:57] <%Gogetta159> This Puzzle is pretty dumb I gotta say
[3:59:57] <%peachy996> They get pissy if you get too close mon
[3:59:58] <%Aydarkzero> wow
[4:00:00] <DandyMackeroos> Gonna get the mugnum now?
[4:00:00] <%Froyuken> This sucks with Chris.
[4:00:06] <%Erimos> This is the most not-puzzle in the game.
[4:00:12] <Corporate_Redeemer> Imagine how many issues would be solved in the RE series if characters just fucking kicked open doors
[4:00:17] <Zaphire_Saucypants> it's not even a puzzle. Just an "examine-fest"
[4:00:18] <+theonebuns> 6 inventory slots or bust
[4:00:32] <%legendscar01> Puzzle to open puzzle to puzzle to get Magnum
[4:00:34] <TalisKanju> get that magnum
[4:00:38] <%Auctorian> Auctorian subscribed at Tier 1. They've subscribed for 14 months! Sweet fak 14 months? What have I done with my life!? Keep on keeping on my man, enjoying your content when I can
[4:00:39] <$Afterman_> yes
[4:00:40] <d00med_magus> Magnum aw yeeeee
[4:00:40] <%natebud> The only enemy standing between you and the magnum was a single bee
[4:00:46] <trianglehat> why
[4:00:48] <GoDZooKii> Like Leon in RE4 just kicks em open.
[4:00:49] <fusedforms> wow ok
[4:00:50] <Zaphire_Saucypants> who cares, it's magnum time
[4:00:50] <DandyMackeroos> Honestly I tried to shove them in the slots without understanding the “puzzle”
[4:00:51] <ThatOneGuyYouSaw> but y tho
[4:00:52] <%takokasa> the mugnum Pog
[4:00:53] <+Grayhammatter> the mag num
[4:00:54] <FatherGreyBeard> what the fuck
[4:00:55] <JackKrauser> Lisa Trevor.. best part of this game.
[4:00:55] <%Froyuken> Will they even slot in if you didn't examine first?
[4:00:56] <rytisone> I have this
[4:00:57] <%Erimos> apatBig mugnum
[4:01:01] <%Aydarkzero> well at least it gets used quick
[4:01:08] <%ZizerX> who leaves a gun in a grave?
[4:01:08] <%Aydarkzero> monkaS
[4:01:08] <%legendscar01> Lisa Trevor is scary though
[4:01:09] <+NinjaWitaSniper> @AngriestPat its quicker to kill Barry to get the Magnum
[4:01:12] <d00med_magus> NOT A BEE
[4:01:13] <rytisone> bdsm sounds
[4:01:14] <Ner234> ohgod ohfuck
[4:01:14] <%Darthwaffler> The RE airforce
[4:01:14] <TalisKanju> They just wanted you to use all of the crests in the game.
[4:01:15] <+Kilik_> and why is a gun in there in the first place lol
[4:01:16] <%NovaKnightmare> lisa its ur birthday
[4:01:16] <DandyMackeroos> @froyuken Nope
[4:01:17] <+pectusumbra> Not for nothing, that's fucking stupid though. What is this, Dusk?
[4:01:17] <MrDonTacos_> monkaS p-paige?
[4:01:18] <%Erimos> LOVE this area
[4:01:22] <%rumtumtugnutz> MUGNAM
[4:01:25] <Zaphire_Saucypants> it's hip to NOT fuck bees.
[4:01:26] <fearhurst> bee
[4:01:31] <Rayorin> 500 s&w magnum
[4:01:34] <%spongeofmystery> Lisa Trevor is genuinely effective horror, even as you learn who she was
[4:01:38] <%Monkeyweed21> this puzzle was designed to stop Paige
[4:01:45] <%D3rrtyD4n> D3rrtyD4n subscribed at Tier 1. They've subscribed for 2 months! 
[4:01:45] <Ether101_Prime> Isn't the Python supposed to be a custom made gun? Why do we find a second one here?
[4:01:45] <$WackyXmand> it's that crazy family that got experimented on...oh wait?
[4:01:47] <BeefyQueefer> pat smeels
[4:01:49] <Soulbishop> Lisa's arc borrowed heavily from Faceoff movie
[4:01:52] <MachineHead9> it's a .357 magnum
[4:01:53] <Zaphire_Saucypants> Tragic Lisa
[4:01:53] <%legendscar01> Lisa is legit scary
[4:01:56] <TalisKanju> Also to fool you into thinking that you would use the crests to open the door to the dormitory/residence
[4:01:56] <%necrocannibal2> @AngriestPat when will Paige play this?
[4:01:59] <DandyMackeroos> So why does Lisa knock you out and then move a little?
[4:02:03] <%FalseEyeD> What was that noise?
[4:02:04] <DandyMackeroos> you
[4:02:10] <shinichizio> Whose footprints are these?
[4:02:10] <FirearmsInstructor> @AngriestPat Funfact for any who care: The Colt Python from this game that was discontinued by the manufacturer is being remade in 2020! (Which is SUPER awesome for firearms enthusiasts.)
[4:02:12] <%Froyuken> @spongeofmystery Agree. She gave me the heebee geebee all throughout my first playthrough.
[4:02:12] <%Aydarkzero> who started that fire?
[4:02:13] <%scaryboisupreme> Shut up about face off goddamn it i thought we had escaped from the Faces coming off
[4:02:16] <TalisKanju> Time to get knocked the fuck out
[4:02:25] <%Erimos> @AngriestPat when you hear the door open move by the window near the bed.
[4:02:31] <$Jmann1892> Lisa is such a good addition
[4:02:31] <%legendscar01> Surprise mutherfucker
[4:02:36] <trianglehat> oof
[4:02:39] <%Froyuken> Read how it's written.
[4:02:45] <%spongeofmystery> God damn the sound design is so FUCKING GOOD
[4:02:46] <%peachy996> There's a really good angle if you look at the balcony when she comes in
[4:02:46] <%legendscar01> Sad
[4:02:46] <%natebud> So when did Trevor die? One of his messages was from 1967
[4:02:47] <%cdrom321> @All_Salt If it's a 900W UPS, then it's probably a CyberPower. That's the top 900W on Amazon.
[4:02:47] <GoDZooKii> I wanna take her face. Off.
[4:02:50] <%Elky3> chariCRY
[4:02:50] <rytisone> Lisa LOVES Face Off

[4:02:56] <Mister_McDerp> BibleThump
[4:02:59] <JackKrauser> Pat was right. This part back in '03 was something else.. the reveal.
[4:03:00] <%marsproject> Umbrella is just cartoonishly evil

[4:03:10] <%Auctorian> cheer500 still salty about FFVII being delayed but this looks fine as heck. Did they include optional tank controls in the settings?
[4:03:12] <trianglehat> CATBUTT

[4:03:32] <%peachy996> I like how RE's Lisa has it just as bad as Silent Hill's Lisa
[4:03:32] <d00med_magus> its DA babby
[4:03:33] <%lego_beef> he sensed the chat was sad and blessed us
[4:03:34] <+professormorrigan> K.O
[4:03:34] <Constr12> you should tell elmo he is a cat
[4:03:36] <%RubberFistFight> people are being shitty to woolie on twitter again.
[4:03:38] <Wan6Saber> kek
[4:03:39] <+pectusumbra> AND SHE GOES IN WITH THE DOUBLE HAMMER
[4:03:39] <fearhurst> cheekz
[4:03:39] <Ran196> ktfo
[4:03:40] <%spongeofmystery> ah, you missed the spook camera angle at the window
[4:03:43] <%natebud> Then Lisa had to escape from that prison on the oil refinery
[4:03:44] <allanmiri> What up Lisa
[4:03:47] <%optimasmaximas> @RubberFistFight about?
[4:03:48] <zamzoph> monkaS
[4:03:53] <%D3rrtyD4n> bonk
[4:03:59] <Zaphire_Saucypants> never bother
[4:04:00] <%xxinevitablexii> is that the Lost Sinner?
[4:04:02] <%peachy996> Cheap hit
[4:04:02] <%natebud> the backhand
[4:04:02] <%RubberFistFight> @optimasmaximas the "self censorship" video
[4:04:04] <%cdrom321> @All_Salt Great. Now I want one. $150 isn't bad.
[4:04:07] <%Erimos> You can see her out the window before she knocks you out.
[4:04:08] <zamzoph> she? WutFace
[4:04:09] <%Darthwaffler> yeah girl
[4:04:11] <%legendscar01> Lisa is stronger then Nemesis
[4:04:12] <rytisone> so Mr. X?
[4:04:13] <%Aydarkzero> @xxinevitablexii you aren't wrong
[4:04:14] <%takokasa> The ULTIMATE BIO-weapon
[4:04:14] <smugjorgen98> but you can shoot nemesis
[4:04:16] <%Froyuken> A slowmacis if you will.
[4:04:20] <$Jmann1892> Fun Fact: Lisa will go down in four shots from the grenade launcher @AngriestPat
[4:04:22] <%ZizerX> so this is lisa
[4:04:22] <d00med_magus> like miley she cant be tamed
[4:04:22] <%ha2ken> Bitches can't be stopped. It's true.
[4:04:23] <SailingSaturn> Is she Nemesis's Mom?! cirD
[4:04:28] <Zaphire_Saucypants> oh so hidden
[4:04:29] <Mister_McDerp> monkaS
[4:04:29] <TalisKanju> Like there
[4:04:31] <JackKrauser> Fun fact, she was the original host for the G-Virus and Nemesis parasite.
[4:04:41] <%natebud> You almost ran into him
[4:04:43] <%scaryboisupreme> If you think about it, Lisa is basically proto Nemesis
[4:04:45] <%RubberFistFight> @optimasmaximas they seem to be taunting him about "getting ratio'd for pat's sake", which is pretty rude.
[4:04:49] <%legendscar01> @AngriestPat Lisa is stronger then Nemesis
[4:04:54] <%Aydarkzero> that explains why Nemesis keeps getting up
[4:05:00] <FirearmsInstructor> @JackKrauser haznoThink
[4:05:00] <%xxinevitablexii> hahhaha, "Manor"
[4:05:01] <Zaphire_Saucypants> gotta love dem leeches
[4:05:09] <+pectusumbra> Yeah, Umbrella sure seems to like those prepubescent girls.
[4:05:09] <rytisone> "What else can we infect her with"
[4:05:12] <%Froyuken> @RubberFistFight What's that even mean?
[4:05:16] <%honeyman18> well that's a lot of fucked up shit
[4:05:16] <%Mr_Pylon> So she's just a virus percolator?
[4:05:16] <%optimasmaximas> @RubberFistFight ah so the usual degeneracy of 'but muh waifu"
[4:05:17] <%ZizerX> rough
[4:05:18] <Mister_McDerp> is she the ultimate bioweapon?
[4:05:18] <Jrocy247> What the fuck is the end goal of making all these zombies?
[4:05:24] <%Kegeto> Damn i missed lisa
[4:05:24] <allanmiri> Nuke likely did
[4:05:25] <Stillchr> She is considered dead when spencer mansion exploded
[4:05:25] <%scaryboisupreme> She dies in Umbrella Chronicles
[4:05:25] <SirFailsAlott> PROBABLY
[4:05:26] <+pectusumbra> *probably*
[4:05:26] <%natebud> She was pretty deep underground though
[4:05:28] <@commanderclaw> Isn't this way out in the woods though? She'd still be alive
[4:05:28] <MachineHead9> i think wesker stops here
[4:05:28] <NeroInfinite> Immortality
[4:05:28] <%Erimos> !BIOCURSED!
[4:05:31] <JackKrauser> The files really make Birkin much worse than he already was.
[4:05:32] <Neo_Kaiser> Then they dump a bunch of Phazon all over her.
[4:05:32] <%SvenHolgersson> She was immune to nuke's god read the lore
[4:05:33] <GoDZooKii> Did it though?
[4:05:33] <%scaryboisupreme> Wesker kills her
[4:05:33] <%NovaKnightmare> Wesker and her have a coolass fight tho in the chronicles game
[4:05:33] <Ran196> nukes can't go underground
[4:05:35] <%peachy996> We never saw her die so she must be alive
[4:05:35] <%spongeofmystery> G-Virus seems less like a deliberate thing and more an accidental discovery
[4:05:35] <Huntercd> Fuck umbrella and the Birkins
[4:05:35] <Zaphire_Saucypants> moneh
[4:05:38] <%PrettyThickandStrongDyck> I thought it was the manison exploding killed lisa
[4:05:38] <+reycharles75> @jrocy247 cash money
[4:05:38] <%legendscar01> Yes, accident best bioweapon
[4:05:41] <%Aydarkzero> Brad PogChamp
[4:05:42] <%OldOnyx> progenitor virus is in there somewhere to
[4:05:42] <%marsproject> Doesn't Birkin literally scream that "G WAS MY CREATION!" ?
[4:05:43] <DandyMackeroos> Was it a nuke?
[4:05:43] <+craftyraichu> Wesker goes back to finisher is in Darkside Chronicles I think
[4:05:43] <dickbuttwoman> The zombies were a bonus. Unintended
[4:05:45] <%peachy996> SHIT
[4:05:45] <%Shadowpint> @AngriestPat Are you going for the best ending
[4:05:45] <VioletRosefall> Wesker kills her on Umbrella Chronicles
[4:05:46] <%reneries> anything that breaks the Geneva Convention rules
[4:05:46] <Jrocy247> That's stupid
[4:05:48] <ThespianBarrage> Nuke? Just duck and cover.
[4:05:49] <%peachy996> IT'S BROKEN
[4:05:49] <d00med_magus> @angriestpat she does in UC
[4:05:50] <%OldOnyx> too
[4:05:51] <dickbuttwoman> T-Virus is super-soldier serum
[4:05:52] <%reneries> so yea Zombies lol
[4:05:52] <Butterjawgaming> Its a risk reward business model, The risk is zombies The reward... is also zombies
[4:05:54] <+BionoidLCR> @Jrocy247 zombies werent the intent the bio mutants were
[4:05:55] <ittla> wow foul languange
[4:05:56] <%Tearonex> 'JILL TO CHICKEN HEART'
[4:05:58] <Stillchr> Zombies were a side effect of making hunters and Tyrants, werent they?
[4:05:59] <+JohnMcClane6194> she said the shit word
[4:06:00] <%BioHunter> arent zombies just a by product?

[4:06:02] <Zaphire_Saucypants> haha
[4:06:03] <+pectusumbra> What really? In chronicles? I can't tell if that's awesome or like shitting all over
[4:06:04] <Naho_Saenoki> @Jrocy247 The zombies were an accident. The viruses are what are to be sold.
[4:06:05] <%trekkie11041> @spongeofmystery pretty much. birkin just improved on what he found
[4:06:08] <%Darthwaffler> Doggos
[4:06:10] <Neo_Kaiser> Is Wesker excited being in the mansion after having the most boring Saturday night ever?
[4:06:11] <%D3rrtyD4n> was that a 2fer? PogChamp
[4:06:11] <Jrocy247> There won't be no money to BUY OR SELL if everyone's a fucking Zombie

[4:06:43] <%Kegeto> Holy shit pat a god
[4:06:45] <%natebud> My head canon for a while was that Umbrella was trying to find a way to make people live forever and T virus was just a byproduct
[4:06:45] <FirearmsInstructor> @AngriestPat Clipped that shit
[4:06:45] <Salik4611> hello

[4:07:20] <DandyMackeroos> @natebud It make sense if you think about Spencer
[4:07:22] <Jrocy247> So the Virus was a side effect. What's the purpose of having these Virus....Like, What are gonna do with them WHEN they buy them?
[4:07:23] <%Darthwaffler> I guess Pat Isn't a fake fan

[4:07:30] <%likuuwu> apatWink
[4:07:34] <%D3rrtyD4n> no snakes yet
[4:07:36] <Neo_Kaiser> Jill breaks the crank in RE3 cause she got so much muscle from using it in RE1.
[4:07:36] <%Froyuken> @ha2ken I like that better.

[4:09:01] <$WackyXmand> it's the Evil Residence
[4:09:02] <%xxinevitablexii> they steal your herbs and re-seal the bag
[4:09:04] <TheShadowWolfen> @angriestpat so whats the purpose of doing zone transitions with doors if they never use em for a jump scare?
[4:09:05] <%necrocannibal2> @natebud you too bud
[4:09:11] <%Froyuken> That hole, Pat.

[4:09:19] <rytisone> will plant42 kick Pat's ass again?
[4:09:25] <+BionoidLCR> @Jrocy247 thats probably cause wesker doin dirt, and ada selling the virus to who knows who after she escaped id guess
[4:09:29] <ittla> resi is better than jump scares
[4:09:30] <%natebud> I just think they're neat
[4:09:33] <%necrocannibal2> oh
[4:09:35] <Zaphire_Saucypants> so many stun gun batteries you got there
[4:09:37] <ThatOneGuyYouSaw> @majorcrasher there were flip phones in the mid 90s
[4:09:38] <$WackyXmand> *shh* drama
[4:09:38] <%Erimos> Loads in the original, atmosphere in REmake.
[4:09:40] <%legendscar01> You can skip the load times in the ds I believe
[4:09:43] <JackKrauser> No.
[4:09:44] <%legendscar01> No
[4:09:45] <%natebud> NOPE
[4:09:46] <%Aydarkzero> believe us we will Kappa
[4:09:47] <Nina96> no
[4:09:50] <%D3rrtyD4n> naw
[4:09:50] <marvel877> No
[4:09:51] <%manwithboxonhead> They do jump scare
[4:09:52] <%peachy996> Not really no
[4:09:52] <%Froyuken> There's only like 4 zombos here.
[4:09:54] <DandyMackeroos> Again Deadly Silence nullifies this
[4:09:56] <%Kegeto> Nah
[4:09:56] <rytisone> some people are
[4:10:00] <Ran196> nope, just get it for the free oil
[4:10:02] <cant_pick_a_name> I could have sworn one of the old games had a jump scare during a room transition
[4:10:05] <%D3rrtyD4n> maybe one zombie
[4:10:06] <%Monkeyweed21> I'd respect Umbrella WAY MORE if the endgame of all this bullshit was to create monster girl waifus
[4:10:08] <FirearmsInstructor> @AngriestPat I read zombies take 5-30 minutes, depending on a formula, to change to a CH.
[4:10:10] <%natebud> All you can do is grab some oil on the way back

[4:11:26] <trianglehat> don't kill zombie spoders, they keep zombie flies in check
[4:11:26] <%peachy996> Attack pose

[4:11:45] <FirearmsInstructor> @manwithboxonhead RPGAyaya
[4:11:45] <%Auctorian> Why is it the go to image my brain uses when someone says arachniphobia is Mr. Sark getting that tarantula encased in glass in Machinima's Dropbox?
[4:11:47] <%reneries> anyone here remember 8 Legged Freaks?
[4:11:47] <Spyder1246> =(
[4:11:48] <%Dementedpenguin> I think I'm more bothered by their moving sound than their actual appearance.
[4:11:50] <TheShadowWolfen> actual mechanics to combat load times... interesting
[4:11:51] <TheTrueZyozz> ;w; Spiders will now cry.
[4:11:52] <Zaphire_Saucypants> you need da book tho

[4:12:44] <%D3rrtyD4n> its always a combo of 3, 5, and 6
[4:12:45] <Arweynn> I happen to quite like spiders, for an arachnophobe. Except when they decide to try to LAND ON MY FUCKING FACE while I'm trying to go to sleep. Then they signed their own death warrant.
[4:12:46] <%ha2ken> They spit fart liquid

[4:13:06] <Fujiwara_92> vergil?
[4:13:06] <KenzBurp> you know, ranking spiders, i think hairy ones are less scary than the sleek shiny ones
[4:13:06] <%trekkie11041> @Run44forrest they werent considered viable as bio weapons due to theyre lack of intelligence.
[4:13:08] <%D3rrtyD4n> and combo is for vjolt

[4:14:25] <%Erimos> @AngriestPat you need the book regardless. You just don't need to do the thing with the lighter here.
[4:14:31] <thetruenicster> It Is true

[4:16:00] <SailingSaturn> "I heard someone betraying us"
[4:16:01] <%Froyuken> "myself" not "my self".
[4:16:03] <%necrocannibal2> is Barry on bath salts?

[4:16:25] <+visidan> calebSM
[4:16:26] <%tigerfang86> some ZOMBIE AIR
[4:16:28] <%Mr_Pylon> Is Barry actually old or is he anime old?
[4:16:32] <trianglehat> but who's the REAL monster
[4:16:32] <d00med_magus> @jrocy247 no Barry is the helicopter pilot in 3
[4:16:33] <%gespenst25> well for one thing you were almost a Jill sandwich
[4:16:33] <%gamingspacesloth> HE CANT RUN. HE PREVENTS THE SANDWICH
[4:16:35] <%xxinevitablexii> bury
[4:16:35] <TheTrueZyozz> @GoDZooKii, You probably didn't do stuff in order. I think getting the shotgun makes it so he also saves you later one.
[4:16:35] <%peachy996> Hey Pat what are you going to use the Self Defense Gun on? Kinda curious
[4:16:38] <%manwithboxonhead> Barry: Um I monologue to myself under stress. I’m going out for a smoke break.
[4:16:39] <TheTrueZyozz> on!
[4:16:40] <%spiritofmojave> just slightly crazy
[4:16:40] <+BionoidLCR> @Mr_Pylon anime old
[4:16:40] <s1rcuit> did they just forget they're stuck in a mansion with zombies and monsters?
[4:16:41] <%Aydarkzero> Barry you good?
[4:16:41] <TheTrueZyozz> Fuck.
[4:16:41] <Soulbishop> Barry is old with 2 daughters
[4:16:41] <%natebud> Sometimes I like to practice my British accent Jill. No worries.
[4:16:43] <JackKrauser> I miss this version of Barry.
[4:16:45] <%scaryboisupreme> Barry's like, what, 45 or something?
[4:16:45] <Ran196> why don't Jill ever offer to go with Barry
[4:16:50] <AntChodeny> Barry is anime old
[4:16:55] <%Froyuken> @Mr_Pylon He's in his 30s. So anime grandpa.
[4:16:58] <ThatOneGuyYouSaw> was Berry betraying you from the very beginning?
[4:16:58] <%manwithboxonhead> And my smoke break.
[4:16:59] <DandyMackeroos> Barry is a Dad
[4:17:01] <Jrocy247> @d00med_magus OOOH Okay....I was about to say....

[4:17:50] <trianglehat> hmm tentacles
[4:18:07] <%Monkeyweed21> seriously why does the T-Virus need to do all this shit to make money?
[4:18:09] <%natebud> It's really lucky that the Umbrella Corporation just straight up discovered magic. So they could make all this bullshit.
[4:18:16] <d00med_magus> hmm blood play and tentacles I like
[4:18:18] <%xxinevitablexii> Need more plasmaaaaa
[4:18:24] <+malibu_mitch> malibu_mitch subscribed with Twitch Prime. 
[4:18:30] <Mister_McDerp> the t-virus does whatever the plot demands it does
[4:18:38] <%Froyuken> Where the zombies at?
[4:18:51] <%ha2ken> @Erimos I believe so.
[4:18:57] <%natebud> No baby magnum?
[4:19:02] <Stillchr> T-virus is mostly growth and strength, and then does weird magic stuff depending on the specific strain?
[4:19:04] <MachineHead9> there's different strains of the t-virus
[4:19:08] <%Monkeyweed21> the scripT-Virus @Mister_McDerp
[4:19:10] <%D3rrtyD4n> yup
[4:19:12] <%natebud> ah right
[4:19:20] <%Froyuken> Baby magnum doo doo do-do-do-do.
[4:19:21] <%gespenst25> is this the GameCube remake? did this ever get a reremake?
[4:19:22] <%spiritofmojave> is that the scripT?
[4:19:25] <FirearmsInstructor> Wait what? Baby magnum??
[4:19:27] <%optimasmaximas> prolly gonna fall asleep in the next few minutes while watching so if i do night chat!
[4:19:28] <%spiritofmojave> oh no it's flying away
[4:19:29] <fusedforms> tbh RE could've just gone the "demons did it" route and it would've made more sense
[4:19:33] <%Froyuken> @gespenst25 Yep.

[4:19:46] <Zaphire_Saucypants> and it's probably gonna get remade again
[4:19:48] <%Erimos> Baby magnum is that one item in RPGs you never use.
[4:19:51] <%ArtoriasTheTrenchfighter> @Monkeyweed21 You don't understand, they don't just want to make money, they want to get all the possible money and resources they can to fund their attempts against that Meddlesome Fool Flash Gordon
[4:19:52] <TalisKanju> The baby magnum -- or the SUICIDE DERRINGER
[4:19:53] <%D3rrtyD4n> ba-by mag-num

[4:20:04] <+G_Thunders> Ironically the RE movies gave an explanation why Umbrella is so comically shitty- they used the T virus to end humanity on purpose as a “reset.”

[4:20:24] <FirearmsInstructor> @Darastrix I hate you
[4:20:25] <%natebud> The awesome stopping power of .22 Magnum!!! @FirearmsInstructor
[4:20:27] <%peachy996> @Erimos Can't it kill Black Tiger
[4:20:29] <%xxinevitablexii> thats about as opposite of a magnum as a handgun can get
[4:20:33] <%spongeofmystery> @Dotta5 CHEAT?
[4:20:40] <SMuffinMan> People pick up that gun?
[4:20:41] <+NinjaWitaSniper> @AngriestPat Baby Magnum will oneshot Tyrant, save it
[4:20:41] <%peachy996> Or does it tank the shot
[4:20:49] <%Darthwaffler> Is it for shooting babies?
[4:20:49] <%gespenst25> Linda: But I refuse
[4:20:50] <%spiritofmojave> magnum babies, making your dreams come true

[4:21:00] <Zaphire_Saucypants> if that's true, do it

[4:21:02] <%Ganerumo> baby magnum is ridiculous
[4:21:03] <DeltascapeV4> 3
[4:21:06] <%D3rrtyD4n> you 1 shot tyrant if you dont save barry

[4:21:21] <%D3rrtyD4n> then many shots atpRtsd
[4:21:24] <rytisone> always save Barry
[4:21:25] <deviljhojho_> Always save barry
[4:21:26] <%Erimos> I don't think it does. I always use it on Tyrant and still have to switch to the other magnum.
[4:21:31] <%SvenHolgersson> CHOOSE: BARRY OR ONE SHOT BOSS
[4:21:31] <deviljhojho_> imagine not saving barry like afucking dork
[4:21:36] <Dellago> I remember the first time I ever played this on Gamecube, blew the baby magnum on the Shark after beaching it
[4:21:37] <+NinjaWitaSniper> @AngriestPat you can also get barry's magnum and it will also one shot Tyrant
[4:21:38] <%natebud> You can also kill krauser with the baby magnum.

[4:28:35] <%spiritofmojave> is Barclay gonna show up?
[4:28:35] <%natebud> 356
[4:28:35] <%Darthwaffler> Spider Cop!
[4:28:39] <%ha2ken> My Spidey senses are tingling
[4:28:42] <MrDonTacos_> monkaS 👉 🕷️ SPODERS?
[4:28:44] <Ran196> Calling All Spider Riders
[4:28:47] <Zaphire_Saucypants> four lashes
[4:28:50] <Mister_McDerp> SPIDERS-MAN
[4:28:50] <AMaidIndeed> someone call spoodermin to save us
[4:28:51] <fearhurst> MAXIMUM SPIDER
[4:28:58] <%Froyuken> Don't know if Richard ever survives Yawn in Jill's campaign.
[4:29:01] <%SvenHolgersson> Love how the T Virus is just the cause of every stupid thing in this universe
[4:29:04] <%TomDanksEGOT> Why couldnt Richard give a Samuel L Jackson style Deep Blue Sea speech here then get snatched up by the shark instead of dying to the snake
[4:29:04] <DandyMackeroos> I think the Guardhouse is my favorite part of REmake
[4:29:07] <%natebud> That spider's just minding his own business.
[4:29:08] <TheTrueZyozz> FUCK! HUG!
[4:29:12] <trianglehat> who would win, a Jill in a hat, or one cartilaginous boi?
[4:29:15] <Zaphire_Saucypants> two lashes
[4:29:18] <GameOver_Here> Pretty sure Richard always dies.
[4:29:21] <%manwithboxonhead> Sharks are dangerous, got it.
[4:29:22] <+someyounguy1> arachnophobia activate
[4:29:23] <%Froyuken> So Richard dies at the Aqua Ring in Chris' if you give him the serum in time.
[4:29:27] <%xxinevitablexii> there is a cat on my keyboard
[4:29:28] <%spongeofmystery> I had to get my little brother to do this section, the bit in the caves and that one tunnel in Zero when I was younger
[4:29:30] <TheTrueZyozz> HUG DUH CREATUURES!

[4:29:52] <Zaphire_Saucypants> zero lashes
[4:29:56] <TheTrueZyozz> THAT'S WHY THEY NEED HUGS!

[4:30:12] <DeanX27> That's a big Charlotte
[4:30:17] <trianglehat> these puzzles are some conspiracy level insane
[4:30:18] <rytisone> for every day in a year
[4:30:21] <%Erimos> Shoutouts to the RE HD Randomizer for giving me my favorite enemy types in RE--land sharks and screaming bees.
[4:30:27] <FatherGreyBeard> wow they are chumps
[4:30:29] <%the_vedo_show> lol spider was confused
[4:30:29] <+ShutUpAceyP> did he already finish code veronica?
[4:30:30] <SirBrawler18> Its weird a lot of my favorite series like RE and Metroid I didnt get into untill after high school
[4:30:31] <%natebud> I still have the sticky note with this puzzle solution from playing this last week.
[4:30:37] <+ausl0> spiders too dummy thicc
[4:30:40] <%xxinevitablexii> CVX is kill
[4:30:46] <%the_vedo_show> Shit was terrible tho
[4:30:46] <+ShutUpAceyP> damn i'm so behind
[4:30:49] <%Ganerumo> To be honest I would really like to see a RTX recreation of the spencer mansion, it would look dope
[4:30:49] <Oxybe> any reasoning behind the spiders, or just the usual "Lul, SCIENCE!!!"?
[4:30:52] <+Imperial_Madman> @AngriestPat what if the spiders went on the pool table and moved the balls around
[4:30:53] <$joylent_blue> i don't think.... that's the saying
[4:30:54] <JackKrauser> @AngriestPat Are you playing this with any visual mods on PC?
[4:30:57] <%xxinevitablexii> dont squeeze the cock
[4:30:59] <trianglehat> spiders just busy shaking that thicc abdomen
[4:31:02] <mackumbopus> pat when will you play the Ace Combat 7 DLC?
[4:31:09] <+MrPenguin30> apatBlep_SG
[4:31:09] <cant_pick_a_name> it was so bad he wanted to finish it asap
[4:31:11] <%peachy996> Is it though?
[4:31:11] <ScreamLord> Fun Fact: Most spider have shit eye sight. WHich means when I spider is scuttling toward you it is doing so blindly
[4:31:11] <%the_vedo_show> RE4 mad long but maaaaad good
[4:31:11] <MachineHead9> yeah re4 is the longest
[4:31:11] <%Monkeyweed21> Did you enjoy when Steve turns into Necrid @AngriestPat ?
[4:31:13] <+TheBitingIrish> 3 and a half hours? Not on pace for the unlocks, huh?
[4:31:14] <%Sausious> 4 reallly isn't that long
[4:31:16] <FirearmsInstructor> @AngriestPat You said "orange green red" then "365", but Orange Green Red (in that order) is "563". Does order matter?
[4:31:16] <cosmicgoatee> @angriestpat i wonder how insane a makeover the Code Veronica remake would entail
[4:31:18] <%TomDanksEGOT> @AngriestPat Hey you stop squeezing chickens!
[4:31:18] <MrDonTacos_> RE4 pistol only? PogChamp
[4:31:21] <+Demerson13> RE4 is my most hated RE game
[4:31:22] <hzealot> which is longer, ashley yelling leon, or re4
[4:31:22] <+NinjaWitaSniper> @AngriestPat CVX is the longest in the series though
[4:31:23] <+ShutUpAceyP> you gonna do co op with 5 or 6?
[4:31:25] <$rytyoung> @AngriestPat
[4:31:26] <%TonyPullMyDTRedgrave> honestly felt like 5 was longer than 4
[4:31:27] <+Strange_Bot> @AngriestPat RE7 isn't that long right?
[4:31:27] <SirFailsAlott> fucking doing every campaign in RE6

[4:33:12] <%speaks2much> game so gushy
[4:33:17] <KamikazeKangaro> I'll watch but only if you ask nicely
[4:33:18] <TalisKanju> Resident Evil DS is good but it's basically just Directors Cut with new (bad) voices
[4:33:18] <%Darthwaffler> I've only ever beat RE4, however, I beat it 8 times. 5 times on PS2, 2 times on Gamecube and 1 time on Wii

[4:33:30] <fearhurst> nice fallopian folds
[4:33:31] <+Strange_Bot> You should play the alpha versions of RE 1 and 2. Or the unfinished Gameboy color port of RE 1
[4:33:33] <%cdrom321> At least we also have the Zelda and Spongebob versions.
[4:33:36] <majindusto> Like He Cares lol

[4:33:48] <+someyounguy1> but i dont have a carrier pidgeon to send my email to misispiouri
[4:33:49] <%toolofparanoia> And he will not give two fucks about a joke that old lol

[4:34:38] <%peachy996> Lke the Del Lago trick
[4:34:39] <Corporate_Redeemer> @oxybe Honestly, seeing giant, venomous spiders coming at you is one hell of a psychological warfare tactic and can easily take any army off guard, if even for a second. Plus, they can hole up somewhere, create more right under entire army's noses, attack without warning, and will be tougher to bring down than a human. Their creation could be a military order due to their effectiveness and reducing of human use for armed combat.
[4:34:42] <%TheMattman1313> Too slow, zombambo!

[4:35:01] <%rumtumtugnutz> apatWrong_HF
[4:35:08] <ThatOneGuyYouSaw> I always beat RE4 twice in short proximity before losing my progress and starting over
[4:35:09] <%Niney_Who> Can we all admit Beta-Lickers from RE5 are super lame.
[4:35:12] <+ShutUpAceyP> sounds like there's a lot of replayability with this game
[4:35:12] <Neo_Kaiser> Pat should play RE6 online so that friends can crossplay play the campaign with him and fans can invade as zombies to kill him.
[4:35:14] <Guardiansaiyan> CHOKEJERKING EXTREME
[4:35:14] <TalisKanju> I'm like the opposite -- I have the game on GC, PS2, PS3, and PC, but I beat it every single time only on the Gamecube
[4:35:22] <Wan6Saber> oh pls, a giant ant would be more scary, for the military
[4:35:26] <%peachy996> @Niney_Who lots of things in RE5 are super lame
[4:35:30] <%PrettyThickandStrongDyck> So all the zombies in the manison were ppl kidnapped?

[4:36:12] <%natebud> Cocunuts are a deadlier predator
[4:36:14] <+Estuko> Don't cows cause more deaths?
[4:36:15] <Guardiansaiyan> CAN the undead still Chokejerk?

[4:36:20] <DuoScratch> @TheBitingIrish are you forgetting the fully grown adult putting pressure on it, plus factoring the fact that it could have been old rope from the start? ;p
[4:36:20] <Soulbishop> God damn ADOBE!
[4:36:20] <GameOver_Here> Yeah but JAWS tho
[4:36:21] <%Erimos> Show us how dangerous bees are Kappa
[4:36:24] <Tucker0603> sharks are good
[4:36:24] <Mister_McDerp> watch out for bull sharks though, they go up rivers
[4:36:24] <+someyounguy1> oh no, pat referenced a fact. the world must bend out of the way
[4:36:25] <%the_vedo_show> LMAO
[4:36:25] <Guardiansaiyan> ...
[4:36:25] <TalisKanju> I like how the accidental cockroach monster are more dangerous than Lickers in RE5
[4:36:26] <ECRead> I swam with a shark once. wonderful creatures
[4:36:26] <+ShutUpAceyP> what about lightning sharks?
[4:36:31] <+NinjaWitaSniper> also Imagine having the units of the enemy army coming back to life and attacking the rest of said army. Easy win. Umbrella knew what they were doing, too bad they were fill with fucking psychopaths
[4:36:31] <s1rcuit> you're 10 times more likely to be killed by cows
[4:36:31] <%spiritofmojave> they really are
[4:36:32] <MachineHead9> I 5 star mercenary mode in re4 to get the op gun
[4:36:33] <%THATGUY_789> more people die from stairs
[4:36:34] <ThatOneGuyYouSaw> Bill Burr would like to have a word with you
[4:36:36] <GameOver_Here> Jaws was a documentary.
[4:36:37] <+cereal_box_conspiracy> We should all be terrified of hamburgers and automobiles.
[4:36:37] <marvel877> So a lot if those people do everything they can to attract the danger?
[4:36:38] <+chronopaladin> but what about a shark fueled by coconuts
[4:36:38] <%Darthwaffler> I only got through Leon's campagne in RE6.
[4:36:41] <+PanicSwytch> Why don't u show cleavage Pat?
[4:36:44] <bluefooddye1> The people who got eaten by sharks probably thought they were pretty dangerous
[4:36:49] <%GeneralSCPatton> @AngriestPat To be fair, that number would be a lot higher if people weren't fucking terrified of sharks.
[4:36:49] <sonicblade38> @AngriestPat what about sharks that shoot lightning
[4:36:51] <%SirFancySwank> sharks are hella dangerous its just that the average person wont see one
[4:36:59] <+Estuko> that sounds weird, don't say that again
[4:36:59] <Soulbishop> I had some crashes where adobe tried to stash over 50gb of recovered PSD in my temp folder!
[4:37:01] <DSD24> More like its calming

[4:37:40] <rytisone> Lisa's tomb
[4:37:42] <%SirFancySwank> depends on the shark
[4:37:44] <TalisKanju> Why did Umbrella make fucking sharks into a BOW
[4:37:45] <%peachy996> Also Mine Puzzle
[4:37:45] <DuoScratch> you know in real life, those boxes would have floped to the other side of the water the second they dropped in.
[4:37:46] <ThatOneGuyYouSaw> that doesn't mean they're not dangerous
[4:37:48] <$WackyXmand> Fun (Untrue) Fact: if punch a shark in the nose it will explode
[4:37:52] <%natebud> Have you ever tried RE7 madhouse? It might as well be Ethan B for how much they change about enemy and items spawns. @AngriestPat

[4:43:53] <Mister_McDerp> the shark deserved better

[4:43:57] <%Froyuken> It can join the Marines.
[4:43:57] <Neo_Kaiser> Is this considered a boss fight?
[4:43:58] <marvel877> You can actually run past that still living shark and get the key. Speedrunners do that.
[4:44:00] <%Tearonex> RESIDENCE EVIL KEY
[4:44:10] <%peachy996> Disagree maybe SH3
[4:44:11] <SirFailsAlott> Silent hill 2 is 2001

[4:44:45] <TalisKanju> The real lesson to learn is that Silent Hill 2 looks better than Code Veronica in every way
[4:44:49] <Ether101_Prime> Pat's going to skip the Outbreak games.

[4:48:04] <%D3rrtyD4n> water is 1

[4:49:23] <FirearmsInstructor> @AngriestPat Serious Pro Life Tip: NEVER POUR A BASE INTO AN ACID
[4:49:23] <thedank> yay kindergarten maths
[4:49:25] <SirBrawler18> is it faster to do this or just fight Plant 42?
[4:49:39] <%xxinevitablexii> what is the v-jolt
[4:49:44] <TalisKanju> @TheTrueZyozz I see, thanks
[4:49:44] <%peachy996> This in my opinion
[4:49:50] <%legendscar01> Insta Kill

[4:49:56] <+Demerson13> WHAT THE FUCK you can climb over that?
[4:49:56] <%xxinevitablexii> thank
[4:49:57] <trianglehat> does v-jolt have electrolytes?

[4:49:58] <+Bipolarhernandez> Did not do the Beenis
[4:50:02] <+Demerson13> I just pushed the crate onto the hole
[4:50:02] <thedank> plant be gone
[4:50:02] <Zaphire_Saucypants> pretty much skip a boss battle
[4:50:04] <FirearmsInstructor> Always acid into base.... if you can't remember that, just think "DON'T PEE INTO ACID"
[4:50:08] <%peachy996> You don't use V-Jolt you still have to fight Plant 42 despite Barry coming in to kill it
[4:50:10] <+ShutUpAceyP> any more uses for the bottles
[4:50:12] <%peachy996> Plus it saves ammo
[4:50:15] <%legendscar01> V- Jolt is Gatorade
[4:50:16] <%natebud> Silent Hill 4 fact: Did you know that Henry is completely invincible during his dodge and charge attacks? You can use this to dodge bullets.
[4:50:17] <%Darthwaffler> @Arek_1 I think it's more about anything other than HDMI being a pain in the ass to record with.
[4:50:21] <heartlesshealer> Nice, I got here before bee swarm
[4:50:21] <%spongeofmystery> Dude, those disappear once you use V JOLT
[4:50:23] <%Sausious> i like that in RE2R the sprinklers drop VJOLT on the plants area (Plant 43)
[4:50:28] <jerkhov_> RE doors sure let you look at chat often

[4:51:01] <%TheMattman1313> Or all 4!
[4:51:03] <%peachy996> What about TERRASAVE
[4:51:03] <%Aydarkzero> what about Blue Umbrella? Kappa
[4:51:04] <%spongeofmystery> @natebud exploited the hell out of that with the rusty axe power attack
[4:51:09] <Zaphire_Saucypants> seem liable to BE part of an experiment too
[4:51:11] <heartlesshealer> that high turnover rate
[4:51:11] <+ExpressNode> Still better than retail
[4:51:12] <MachineHead9> umbrella doesn't care about their employees LUL
[4:51:14] <Stillchr> What about Blue Umbrella from 7, arent they former
[4:51:14] <lotharrio> But what if you got the Wesker or Veronica virus?
[4:51:15] <%Skittlesoul> !uptime
[4:51:15] <@Moobot> I've been playing this game for how long? Oh only 4h 51m.
[4:51:16] <%Ell1ot> what if they had Dental?
[4:51:16] <AdmiralButtloaf> @AngriestPat if Capcom made an Energy drink, as like a promotion, called V-Jolt would you drink it?

[4:51:36] <%Aydarkzero> bUrself

[4:51:42] <%Froyuken> Did you inspect the hole?
[4:51:42] <+ShutUpAceyP> Silent Hill 4 fact: The escort part of the game is a complete joke because the other person can't die and you can use a not to hard to find item to undo any damage to them guaranteeing a better ending
[4:51:45] <%legendscar01> @AngriestPat You can join the U.B.C.S.
[4:51:49] <%SirFancySwank> working for umbrella is like putting yourself on a nazi scientist wanted list

[4:52:09] <%cdrom321> @Froyuken Looks like he just did.
[4:52:10] <ryankr2> Silent Hill 4 fact: it’s a bad game
[4:52:11] <angryfatcat> but think of the amazing medical benefits
[4:52:15] <FirearmsInstructor> @StrawberryPantsu More like BEEE S AA?
[4:52:16] <%SolidusRex> What about Wetland-Yutani? Would you?
[4:52:17] <lotharrio> Pat is less likely to betray humanity for superpowers than Woolie. He'd rather everyone else lose their legs to be his height, first.
[4:52:21] <%xxinevitablexii> umbrella is an HR nightmare
[4:52:28] <%natebud> @spongeofmystery Once you get the ax the difficult practically disappears

[4:52:32] <%SolidusRex> Weyland
[4:52:33] <+restivewolf> what about the new umbrella

[4:52:40] <MachineHead9> bUrself got him
[4:52:40] <%depressed_skeleton> Not the BEEEES
[4:52:50] <%SvenHolgersson> Remember when you were excited to see the Resident Evil movie? Remember it being fucking awful?
[4:52:51] <%TheMattman1313> Congrats Pat you just contributed to the extinction of bees.
[4:52:52] <TalisKanju> That body is clearly pre-rendered
[4:52:59] <%spongeofmystery> @ShutUpAceyP a sacred candle if I recall. Yeah, just use one as you get the umbilical cord and better ending, IIRC
[4:53:03] <%depressed_skeleton> delicious dirty bath water
[4:53:05] <+ShutUpAceyP> silent hill 4 fact: the story is interesting
[4:53:07] <trianglehat> using them banned pesticides
[4:53:07] <Habblewater> the piss tub
[4:53:10] <%thegreatbambe> thegreatbambe subscribed with Twitch Prime. They've subscribed for 31 months! I recently switched from ps4 to pc for iceborne, and man 60fps is a good thing. Also man they're alot of modders
[4:53:15] <TalisKanju> I was never excited to see the Resident Evil movie
[4:53:15] <%Monkeyweed21> Guys I don't think there's a large market for giant monster bees
[4:53:17] <heartlesshealer> You got a filthy bath tub, what do you mean?
[4:53:19] <+Estuko> this triangle instrumental theme reminds me of the psp game Untold Legends: Brotherhood game that sounded extremely similar.
[4:53:21] <SMuffinMan> USE VJOLT IN AQUA RING
[4:53:23] <%the_vedo_show> Lol naisu
[4:53:24] <%Darthwaffler> Eternal Darkness bathroom scare

[4:53:33] <%manwithboxonhead> What if you turned into a Suffering Villain.
[4:53:36] <Sumdumguyy> stop playing the game just pet your cat it's a better investment i promise
[4:53:38] <DSD24> @Estuko That was a good game
[4:53:38] <%Erimos> @AngriestPat you have to go back to the aqua ring to use the V-JOLT on the roots.
[4:53:41] <%D3rrtyD4n> oh yeah, dont forget to use vjolt 1st
[4:53:42] <+Grayhammatter> maybe you would
[4:53:44] <Habblewater> gonna take a shit in a bathtub you can't stop me
[4:53:45] <%legendscar01> The root is in the aqua ring
[4:53:45] <Sumdumguyy> pet your cat for 9 hours straight
[4:53:46] <AntChodeny> i'd drink Barry's bath water, I mean Jill! I meant to say Jill! Oh shit!
[4:53:53] <+ShutUpAceyP> @spongeofmystery i believe so. I've yet to play any SH other than 1.
[4:53:57] <Zaphire_Saucypants> do not progress past this without using v-jolt.

[4:54:11] <%natebud> Silent Hill 4 fact: Eileen can't be killed during gameplay, Henry can't damage her either. Her final health just effects the difficulty of the final boss.

[4:54:57] <Stillchr> Hunk starts a mercenary group specialized in fighting BOW
[4:55:00] <TalisKanju> Never noticed a typewriter being in that room

[4:55:32] <+ShutUpAceyP> do you think they're gonna remake RE1 like 2 and 3?
[4:55:36] <%peachy996> Remember Lupo?
[4:55:42] <%CommanderSqueaks> @Stillchr I was just thinking, he'd be the easy to switch gears to killing Umbrella's zombies after Umbrella started bouncing checks.
[4:55:45] <%D3rrtyD4n> nice LUL

[4:55:50] <%wbo2> its trying to save you
[4:55:51] <SMuffinMan> DSD24 you do in an RE3 epilogue
[4:55:51] <TalisKanju> I don't think they need to re-remake Resident Evil 1
[4:55:52] <ittla> game doesnt even want to be played
[4:55:53] <%the_vedo_show> so broken atpRtsd
[4:55:54] <dickbuttwoman> CONVENIENT

[4:55:58] <MachineHead9> don't waste your tie with umbrella corp LUL
[4:56:01] <%spiritofmojave> That's the opposite of a problem, game like that LOL
[4:56:01] <MachineHead9> time*
[4:56:03] <nademonkey1100> YUP same tried then refunded it
[4:56:04] <MrDonTacos_> sure thing pat
[4:56:05] <%MonsieurHedge> The T in T-virus stands for toxoplasmosis
[4:56:05] <%Erimos> Your computer can't comprehend why you'd want to.
[4:56:05] <%TomDanksEGOT> its a sign
[4:56:05] <heartlesshealer> baby slep
[4:56:08] <+StooEsq> your PC doesn't want that cruel and unusual abuse
[4:56:11] <Stillchr> Hunk abandons umbrella almost immediately after code veronica irc
[4:56:11] <rytisone> baby got back
[4:56:12] <%SolidusRex> Your PC is helping you
[4:56:13] <Drivershaft> PAT HURT THE BABY
[4:56:14] <BeefyQueefer> pat why must you fail elmo thusly
[4:56:15] <TalisKanju> They DO have to remake Code Veronica
[4:56:17] <JackKrauser> ORC is poison on any PC.
[4:56:18] <DSD24> @SMuffinMan I'm fine with a HINT of his face
[4:56:22] <%Aydarkzero> umbrella corps implodes itself when being played
[4:56:26] <%TheShal> YOU HEARD HIM. Umbrela Corp confirmed
[4:56:27] <chambatron> u streaming tomorrow or nah? @angriestpat
[4:56:31] <KaseKaizer> D:
[4:56:34] <+ShutUpAceyP> is there anything good in the FPS remakes?
[4:56:35] <DSD24> Umbrella Corp is that game Steve likes
[4:56:36] <%RubberFistFight> @AngriestPat clearly your video card isn't beefy enough. You need to upgrade again. Apparently USD$1200 wasn't enough, you should spend USD$2400 this time just to be sure. Kappa
[4:56:37] <+NinjaWitaSniper> @xxinevitablexii Fun Fact: The T-Virus requires specific DNA in order to turn into a Tyrant or Lab Conditions, which is why Birkin made the G-Virus which turns EVERYONE into flesh monsters.
[4:56:45] <%depressed_skeleton> Timtams?!
[4:56:48] <%depressed_skeleton> I LOVE TIMTAMS!
[4:56:51] <+Kingtut9009> ORC like Lost Planet 2 is still locked behind Games for Windows Live I think
[4:56:53] <+AtomicVR> Me and my friend rented ORC when it came out just to laugh at it in some local couch coop only to find they somehow made a 4 player coop game with no couch option IT WAS SO LAME
[4:56:54] <Drivershaft> PAT DISTURBED THE BABY
[4:56:55] <heartlesshealer> Oh! It's already out tomorrow?

[4:57:09] <%legendscar01> @AngriestPat What about if Capcom Re-Did Resident Evil 4 new mechanics and levels?
[4:57:11] <%xxinevitablexii> I thought G had to be blood-relatives to really work?
[4:57:16] <SMuffinMan> It's a full pic DSD lol

[4:57:30] <%peachy996> "How do we make this plant look like it's in pain? make it jiggle and wiggle"
[4:57:31] <%the_vedo_show> true
[4:57:32] <rytisone> I agree
[4:57:33] <JackKrauser> RE4 does not need a remake, ever.
[4:57:33] <+NinjaWitaSniper> @xxinevitablexii no it needs people of the same DNA to reproduce, but if injected it turns you into that thing anyways
[4:57:33] <+SpikedFreak> TRUE DAT
[4:57:34] <MachineHead9> RE4 doesn't really need it
[4:57:34] <TheTrueZyozz> I'd take one of those tentacles.
[4:57:35] <%Erimos> Then it wouldn't be RE4.
[4:57:36] <%Aydarkzero> yeah re4 is pretty complete
[4:57:36] <heartlesshealer> Good night Fujiwara
[4:57:36] <%Sausious> this one
[4:57:37] <+ShutUpAceyP> How about remade but just better graphics?
[4:57:39] <Stillchr> G-Mutants hunt down blood relatives
[4:57:42] <Zaphire_Saucypants> agreed
[4:57:43] <Nina96> how mad would u be if they did? @AngriestPat
[4:57:44] <R3TURNoftheMACK> Resident evil 4: Delete Ashley edition
[4:57:46] <TalisKanju> Code Veronica needs a remake.
[4:57:48] <BeefyQueefer> whether it needs it or not isn't as important as if it'll work and make money
[4:57:48] <+reycharles75> re4 is good as it is
[4:57:50] <%PinkSuprende> PinkSuprende subscribed with Twitch Prime. They've subscribed for 19 months! domo arigatou you fuckin gremlin
[4:57:50] <nademonkey1100> night @Fujiwara_92
[4:57:51] <%Aydarkzero> re1 would be great honestly
[4:57:51] <%Tearonex> RE4 is one of the best games ever made
[4:57:52] <%natebud> I hope they never remake CVX.
[4:57:52] <frozenottsel> new RE game bundled with RE4HD?
[4:57:53] <%maskofmichael> So they're gonna do it any way?
[4:57:53] <DeltascapeV4> RE4 needs a better story tbh
[4:57:54] <ittla> CVX really needs it the most
[4:57:54] <Ran196> RE4: Give Ashley a Gun
[4:57:56] <$Hommando> Resident Evil 4: Overtime
[4:57:57] <ryankr2> Yeah re4 is pretty perfect
[4:57:57] <ittla> and RE5
[4:57:59] <%xxinevitablexii> ohhhhh, that makes way more sense. thanks :)
[4:58:00] <%legendscar01> @AngriestPat No ashley
[4:58:02] <DracaenaLeaf> RE1 and CVX could use it the most
[4:58:02] <%spongeofmystery> @xxinevitablexii needs to be relatives for implanted embryos to work properly but regular infection works universally
[4:58:05] <rytisone> CVX Remake, RE8, Revelations 3...
[4:58:08] <MachineHead9> Only thing RE4 is updated graphics
[4:58:08] <Ran196> Let Ashley suplex again
[4:58:10] <%CommanderSqueaks> RE4 doesn't need a remake, it could use an HD remaster.
[4:58:12] <%peachy996> I say do RE4 again to go full circle on this over the shoulder shit
[4:58:13] <%Dotta5> Make Ashley LOUDER
[4:58:13] <marvel877> RE4: Ashley has a real suplex and not a glitch
[4:58:14] <warmnoid> either 0 or CVX
[4:58:16] <Magmalefilme> what about Red.5
[4:58:17] <+chronopaladin> leooooooon
[4:58:18] <saint_ham> think theyll redo re4 with the newer prettier leon
[4:58:20] <%Aydarkzero> no but seriously i'd rather have re8 come after r3make
[4:58:21] <%the_vedo_show> LEON
[4:58:21] <VeryTricky> LEON cirREE
[4:58:22] <Huntercd> CVX needs it bad
[4:58:22] <+MajorCrasher> LEON
[4:58:24] <+Kingtut9009> Do people really complain about Ashley? She literally doesnt matter 90% of the time
[4:58:26] <+PanicSwytch> They need to remake 4,5 and 6
[4:58:26] <%D3rrtyD4n> its a page 1 rewrite! LUL
[4:58:26] <%spiritofmojave> LEONNN
[4:58:28] <AntChodeny> I hope they add the NWF scene so it can become canon.
[4:58:30] <Zaphire_Saucypants> yeah
[4:58:31] <+Grayhammatter> LEON
[4:58:32] <%ha2ken> LEONNNNN
[4:58:34] <%NovaKnightmare> `BRING BACK ALFRED
[4:58:35] <BeefyQueefer> i'd like a redo of Dino Crisis. the first one would benefit greatly from it
[4:58:35] <%wbo2> patch steve out
[4:58:35] <%Darthwaffler> Give Ashley's ballistics DoA jiggle
[4:58:36] <%Monkeyweed21> kill Steve IMMEDIATELY
[4:58:36] <DracaenaLeaf> or retcon it
[4:58:37] <+chronopaladin> HOYYYY
[4:58:37] <%TheShal> LEON
[4:58:39] <marvel877> FOCUS ON THE INCEST, GOT IT
[4:58:39] <+reycharles75> delete steve
[4:58:39] <Sumdumguyy> 6 needs a remake unironically lol
[4:58:39] <ThatOneGuyYouSaw> CVX remake was recently confirmed
[4:58:39] <rytisone> ehehehehehe
[4:58:40] <Drivershaft> Alfred Ashford is the new playable campaign
[4:58:41] <%spiritofmojave> MORE DOLPHIN NOISES
[4:58:41] <%JustaStove> JustaStove subscribed at Tier 1. They've subscribed for 2 months, currently on a 2 month streak! Not a fan of RE but you're making me like more and more as you go through them
[4:58:41] <%scaryboisupreme> Yeah more Alexia
[4:58:42] <%peachy996> RE5 and 6 could use it most, change the shitty story
[4:58:45] <@commanderclaw> The 8 Ashford Masters
[4:58:45] <Ran196> RE4: Leon get Ashley goes out after the mission
[4:58:47] <%legendscar01> Claire and Steve Fuck
[4:58:50] <%marsproject> Needs a line from Chris about Leon needing to plant his seed in Claire
[4:58:50] <%Aydarkzero> man iomagine if CVX had a 2v2 fight with the ashfords vs the redfields
[4:58:50] <%logoth_> nah dude focus more on monster Wesker
[4:58:51] <nademonkey1100> get that same actor though he fucking nailed it
[4:58:51] <%spongeofmystery> @Monkeyweed21 PERFECT
[4:58:53] <+AtomicVR> The only thing i'd want for new RE4 content is just expanding the Mercenaries mode
[4:58:53] <frozenottsel> The real show stopper would be RE8 or a remake, with RE4 bundled with it.
[4:58:53] <Magmalefilme> RE 3.5
[4:58:54] <Ether101_Prime> The only things RE4 needs added to it is Ashely and Carlos in Mercenaries.
[4:58:56] <Stillchr> make alfred tragic and insane, make alexia insane and just as obssessed with Alfred
[4:58:57] <%Monkeyweed21> Turn Steve into Necrid within an hour
[4:58:57] <ittla> a cvx remake would probably be a massive overhaul from top to bottom
[4:58:58] <%scaryboisupreme> RE4 remake should just be RE4 but with good graphics
[4:58:58] <%CommanderSqueaks> @Kingtut9009 You can just throw her in a trash can and forget about her until you finish the area.
[4:58:58] <TalisKanju> What about Agent Wesker Neo?
[4:58:58] <%CalderGaming> Ar-ar-ar-ar-armin Ashford
[4:58:58] <%natebud> Just remove the ashfords from that game and make a completely new game with them in it. Thats the best you can do with CVX
[4:59:02] <%Tearonex> Make steve less cool and have him die earlier
[4:59:03] <%scaryboisupreme> nothing else changes
[4:59:04] <Huntercd> Creepy incest
[4:59:11] <Soulbishop> But new canon leon got blackout drunk the night before driving into raccoon city.
[4:59:12] <+Estuko> @Huntercd -Folgers-
[4:59:15] <%GeneralSCPatton> @AngriestPat But what if they remade RE4 with a battle roya... nope, can't say that with a straight face.
[4:59:20] <Prestophobia> Zero would also make more sense than 4
[4:59:26] <heartlesshealer> oh hell yeah, temtem is out tomorrow. Thanks for reminder and your upcoming stream, Pat
[4:59:28] <%heroicspiritavenger> Here is how to fix Code Veronica X: Focus more on the Ashfords, change Chris to the primary character, change Clair's story to happening in the background, give Wesker more to do
[4:59:28] <Soulbishop> As if I needed more reason to hate leon
[4:59:29] <+RowenCleric> id rather they make another re2 remake in the style of this game then remake re4
[4:59:29] <%Dotta5> RE4, but you're Trevor Belmont
[4:59:31] <%CommanderSqueaks> @Soulbishop You have it reversed.
[4:59:32] <%spongeofmystery> Alfred should be louder, angrier and have access to a time machine
[4:59:32] <%ospreyworks> All you gotta do is treat a remake of CVX the same way they treated 1—discard the crap, juice up the atmosphere, and add some good story
[4:59:34] <Ran196> but i honestly would like a more fleshed out Leon Krauser story, instead of a story in Darkside
[4:59:34] <ryankr2> Fix the knife so it’s not Broken
[4:59:34] <rytisone> make Steve a literal 4 year old child
[4:59:34] <MachineHead9> RE4 remake Leon says yes to Ashley in the end Kappa
[4:59:36] <%Aydarkzero> @Tearonex how can you make him less cool have his gun misfire in his hands?
[4:59:40] <Drivershaft> Umbrella Corps: Battle Royale
[4:59:40] <JackKrauser> The Ashfords would get toned down completely in this day and age.
[4:59:42] <%Monkeyweed21> Have Steve-Necrid be the Mr. X of CVX
[4:59:42] <+ShutUpAceyP> Resident Battle Evil Royal
[4:59:43] <Soulbishop> oh was that old canon?
[4:59:44] <%natebud> What if they made Steve event worse? And you actually got to fight him as the final boss.
[4:59:50] <%CommanderSqueaks> Totally old canon.
[4:59:52] <+Mitchellsocks> RE 4tnite
[4:59:52] <%peachy996> Alfred Ashford will be tough to get right without the trans community raising an eyebrow
[4:59:54] <Soulbishop> Even better I knew i hated him for a reason
[4:59:54] <MrDonTacos_> I want a RE visual novel FeelsGoodMan
[4:59:58] <%Tearonex> @Aydarkzero IDK man they can find a way!
[5:00:03] <%xxinevitablexii> make steve not point guns in Claire's face all the time
[5:00:05] <cant_pick_a_name> help meee
[5:00:07] <%peachy996> Claire calling him a crossdressing freak does not age well
[5:00:14] <ThatOneGuyYouSaw> make Steve the main character

[5:00:52] <%Too_Much_Nukie> @peachy996 He's not a freak because he crossdresses, but he's still a crossdressing freak because he's crossdressing as his sister who he wants to fuck.
[5:00:52] <smugjorgen98> can we have a world reset
[5:00:53] <%spiritofmojave> @peachy996 they'd have to adapt it for sure, then again you don't have to be trans to crossdress
[5:00:53] <+ShutUpAceyP> plant 42 teaches you the meaning of life
[5:00:54] <Ether101_Prime> How about this for a CVX fix. Actually make it about siblings by making a point to compare and contrast the Ashfords to the Redfields.

[5:01:43] <%natebud> @peachy996 It's like saying James McAvoy in Split was trans.
[5:01:44] <%peachy996> See Barry saves you
[5:01:44] <marvel877> Raccoon City outbreak happened all because Umbrella screwed up making a dank ass strain.
[5:01:45] <%Too_Much_Nukie> @peachy996 Who cares? Fuck them.
[5:01:45] <%Aydarkzero> Barry where did you get that!?
[5:01:46] <%marsproject> Where did Barry get a flamethrower?
[5:01:47] <R3TURNoftheMACK> Barry been hanging out in the mines
[5:01:49] <%Dotta5> internet
[5:01:52] <%D3rrtyD4n> HELL YEAH BARRY
[5:01:52] <PantsSoldSeparately> Hey i'm not super familiar with RE1, how far into the game are we?
[5:01:54] <ECRead> I've read this one before
[5:01:54] <%D3rrtyD4n> GET SOME
[5:01:54] <+ShutUpAceyP> I'm sure he wouldn't burn jill at all
[5:01:54] <Zaphire_Saucypants> badass
[5:01:57] <+Estuko> This is just like in one of my japanese anime!
[5:01:59] <%CommanderSqueaks> Why did Barry have a flame thrower if not precisely to kill this?
[5:02:00] <%SvenHolgersson> Oh yea this is hot
[5:02:01] <%spiritofmojave> @peachy996 oh yeah totally, there'd be backlash no doubt
[5:02:03] <%the_vedo_show> doodNuts doodNuts
[5:02:04] <%Aydarkzero> okay i'm sure Jill would have gotten burned
[5:02:05] <+PanicSwytch> Aaaaaaaahhh
[5:02:07] <%TomDanksEGOT> @AngriestPat how important would it be to get Alfred Ashford's voice actor back just for that laugh if they did the remake
[5:02:08] <%Froyuken> @PantsSoldSeparately Like halfway.
[5:02:08] <%Erimos> PogChamp
[5:02:11] <MachineHead9> @PantsSoldSeparately half way done
[5:02:14] <%CalderGaming> i like how it *doesn't* scream
[5:02:18] <R3TURNoftheMACK> Boss skip successful
[5:02:23] <%peachy996> So much ammo saved
[5:02:23] <heartlesshealer> agreed
[5:02:24] <+ShutUpAceyP> you almost became a jill salad
[5:02:35] <+cereal_box_conspiracy> glad to see they didn't improve the VO quality in the remake
[5:02:37] <PantsSoldSeparately> @Froyuken @MachineHead9 Ty :)
[5:02:39] <%xxinevitablexii> toss it
[5:02:40] <%Froyuken> Pat, only if you didn't save Richard.
[5:02:40] <%spiritofmojave> Will say miss the heavy mid-western/Canadian accent Barry had
[5:02:41] <%cdrom321> Ashley for Mercenaries mode in which all she does is throw lanterns, but there's tons of them everywhere.
[5:02:44] <cant_pick_a_name> that's like three flame rounds lol
[5:02:44] <%Aydarkzero> where'd the flamethrower go?
[5:02:47] <%D3rrtyD4n> goodbye residence
[5:02:50] <ECRead> duh Barry
[5:02:53] <Zaphire_Saucypants> bloody key
[5:02:57] <%legendscar01> All this shit for a key
[5:02:57] <Zaphire_Saucypants> is that rust?
[5:03:01] <+Grayhammatter> goodbye, residence of evil
[5:03:02] <+DRAGKUDO> Yo why does Barry look like David Harbour?
[5:03:05] <+ShutUpAceyP> he just stands there
[5:03:07] <%peachy996> Took an hour
[5:03:07] <+ShutUpAceyP> menacingly
[5:03:09] <marvel877> He's just A posing.
[5:03:10] <%peachy996> Not bad
[5:03:12] <%natebud> man, barry is the best
[5:03:17] <%Froyuken> @DRAGKUDO HE DOES!
[5:03:19] <%spongeofmystery> Wesker shooting bees is legitimately badass
[5:03:21] <%Aydarkzero> Barry sure is cool
[5:03:21] <rytisone> Barry is still hungry
[5:03:25] <+ShutUpAceyP> so was that supposed to be a boss?
[5:03:29] <Huntercd> Becky needs a game
[5:03:30] <%spiritofmojave> Where does Wesker store his bees
[5:03:30] <%legendscar01> WESKER

[5:03:44] <%peachy996> Why were you shooting bees Wesker?
[5:03:50] <Gr4ndm4rsh4ll> wait. what was he shooting at just now?
[5:03:51] <AntChodeny> Albert Whisker
[5:03:52] <marvel877> Mike?
[5:03:52] <%Too_Much_Nukie> You know, if they remade RE 6 and made it so you could change costumes for story mode, made Jill and Sheva appear in the story, and added ALL THE WARRIORS to the bonus modes, it'd be a good game.
[5:03:54] <%D3rrtyD4n> doodWesker
[5:03:55] <cant_pick_a_name> Jill, you're safe. shit.
[5:03:58] <%Brojira> WESKER SMOKE PLANT!

[5:03:59] <%Aydarkzero> this Wesker is so good
[5:04:02] <$WackyXmand> boy does D C Douglas hams it up later
[5:04:02] <TalisKanju> You were going you say "Jill, you're safe"?

[5:04:06] <Ether101_Prime> Val Kilmar.
[5:04:08] <%0oki> After you talk to weaker go back to Barry, I think there’s an additional cutscene @angriestpat
[5:04:08] <Soulbishop> Can someone please tell me why is Leon likable? I can't see it. In the original releases he creeps on Ada so hard that by RE6 he is willing to point a gun at and fight chris to try and save her. In the new And thats just the beginning of my dislike for him. Let's not talk about how he sold Sherry out to the government while she was in his care, or how he never really pursued stopping umbrella and just slid into that secret service promotion. Leon is so trash to me.
[5:04:08] <%spiritofmojave> B)
[5:04:10] <%natebud> TACTICAL
[5:04:12] <%D3rrtyD4n> this is the best wesker
[5:04:13] <%LaughingCatt> doodWesker he returns
[5:04:13] <%peachy996> He's a little robotic but also cocky
[5:04:14] <Mrbaconator> CHRIIIISSSS
[5:04:15] <%LiveStreamOnyx> doodWesker doodWesker doodWesker
[5:04:16] <%Erimos> RE4 is my fav
[5:04:17] <TalisKanju> I thought you liked Resident Evil 5 Wesker the most.
[5:04:18] <Zaphire_Saucypants> Now I can only imagine cat version of Wesker saying "Chriiiiiss" in his version of a meow.
[5:04:18] <%spongeofmystery> @JackKrauser holy hell I never noticed that
[5:04:18] <%Froyuken> Other mansion?
[5:04:19] <bestwaifuritsu> Wesker, its like midnight and youre wearing sunglasses indoors. Stop being cool.
[5:04:20] <MachineHead9> @AngriestPat you planning on doing a chris run?
[5:04:23] <%THATGUY_789> he's a bishy boi
[5:04:24] <%Aydarkzero> bUrself
[5:04:25] <+Grayhammatter> bUrself
[5:04:26] <heartlesshealer> Leon's voice lines, that's why Leon
[5:04:26] <%TomDanksEGOT> Jill was literally about to say "Jill you're safe"?
[5:04:27] <ahhhBEEEEEEEES> FeelsBadMan
[5:04:30] <%Yautjabutts> This guy seems trustworthy
[5:04:33] <frozenottsel> Paige hates bees too
[5:04:34] <MachineHead9> FeelsBadMan
[5:04:34] <%natebud> Does this Wesker look like a guy who would punch a tree lady while on fire?
[5:04:34] <%Brojira> AND HE HIGH AF
[5:04:39] <%peachy996> He always sounds like Garrus even though its a diff VA
[5:04:41] <FirearmsInstructor> @Soulbishop yes
[5:04:42] <JackKrauser> @spongeofmystery Yeah, he smirks before turning to Jill. Nice touch and a hint.
[5:04:43] <%D3rrtyD4n> chris run is just this, but more of a pain
[5:04:43] <+ShutUpAceyP> how many bosses are in this game?
[5:04:46] <+PlagueOfGripes> for some reason I thought you were not going to play remake
[5:04:47] <TalisKanju> COMPLETE. INSECTICIDE. SATURATION.
[5:04:48] <%letjaeeol> apatGib
[5:04:49] <%marsproject> Leave Chris to RE5 so we can see him in all his boulderpunching glory.
[5:04:50] <AMaidIndeed> I ,too, hate bees! Wow I relate to Wesker on an emotional level...
[5:04:51] <+G_Thunders> @soulbishop No one likes 6 enough to factor that lore into the character
[5:04:53] <%Brojira> HE GREW THE PLANT YOU KILLED
[5:04:54] <Ivokki> Zom-bees?
[5:04:58] <%Elky3> are you gonna co op re 6 @AngriestPat ?
[5:04:59] <%Brojira> SMOKED TO THE DOME
[5:04:59] <%legendscar01> @AngriestPat Did you fill your canteen?
[5:04:59] <Nina96> u gonna finish Jill tonight? @AngriestPat
[5:05:01] <heartlesshealer> remember "IT WORKED"? One of the better Leon moments
[5:05:05] <TurtlesAndTentacles> Fuck you Wesker
[5:05:06] <+MajorCrasher> Are you finishing this tonight?
[5:05:06] <+storkeylope> I love the bit where Chris laughs at him and he sounds genuinely hurt
[5:05:08] <%Brojira> THAT IS HIS REASON FOR EVIL
[5:05:15] <%natebud> Chris run is this with a worse shotgun.
[5:05:16] <ThatOneGuyYouSaw> @soulbishop t. Chris
[5:05:17] <MrDonTacos_> Pat hates chris PepeHands
[5:05:25] <%Brojira> DON'T DO DO DRUGS KIDS
[5:05:25] <%spongeofmystery> DC Douglas does a fantastic job in RE5 but I love this version of him
[5:05:30] <%natebud> *10 magazines
[5:05:33] <+NinjaWitaSniper> @AngriestPat the gamecube release of this game has a stack underflow glitch where you put grenades from the box into the grenade launcher and get infinite ammo
[5:05:34] <%legendscar01> Hunter time
[5:05:35] <%Brojira> YOU END UP SESKER COOL
[5:05:37] <MachineHead9> Chris can get the assualt shotgun too
[5:05:37] <%peachy996> You saved right? Pop someone with Baby Magnum
[5:05:39] <%Brojira> WESKER
[5:05:39] <FirearmsInstructor> @AngriestPat Dude your terminology is on point tonight.
[5:05:40] <+Karebuncle> goodbye guard house, i love you
[5:05:41] <%Monkeyweed21> you missed a erb
[5:05:47] <Visored34> so when are gonna get a REREmake?
[5:05:49] <%Brojira> SO MUCH HIGH
[5:05:56] <%D3rrtyD4n> might be dogs here? i forget.
[5:05:58] <Soulbishop> But everyone shits on Chris for punching a boulder and somehow Leon gets a pass for being blinded by a crush.
[5:06:06] <+PanicSwytch> @angriestpat Are u gonna do Chris as well?
[5:06:10] <+Grayhammatter> danger noodles
[5:06:15] <%THATGUY_789> I like how every BOW is dealt with by guns. not very proficient
[5:06:16] <FirearmsInstructor> @AngriestPat You caught and corrected "clip" to "magazine" and just now rephrased "rounds" to "shells".
[5:06:17] <%Brojira> IT GETS GOOD HIGH?
[5:06:17] <%peachy996> In case a snake bites your cheeks?
[5:06:23] <%legendscar01> Fuck you Brad
[5:06:26] <+thesw1tch> @soulbishop people shit on chris for punching a boulder because it totally worked

[5:06:31] <Zaphire_Saucypants> @PanicSwytch he just said he wasn't gonna do a chris run
[5:06:31] <%peachy996> IT'S BROKEN
[5:06:32] <%Too_Much_Nukie> Nobody is shitting on Chris for punching a boulder. Everyone loves Chris for punching a boulder.
[5:06:34] <TalisKanju> Chris, though doing more than Leon, is less interesting than Leon.

[5:06:51] <SpawnConnery> Bread!
[5:06:52] <%huberthecockatoo> @thatoneguyyousaw I assume you're joking but actually fleshing out his story on screen may be a good way to make his standoffish nature and angsty outbursts feel less out of nowhere, therefore making him feel much more relatable and..... tragic I guess?
[5:06:52] <+JohnMcClane6194> she said the shit word again
[5:06:54] <MrDonTacos_> bread
[5:06:54] <%THATGUY_789> omg Brad

[5:06:55] <%peachy996> What a fucking pottymouth
[5:06:55] <heartlesshealer> Wait, people s**t on Chris for punching a boulder? I thought people liked it the same way you can suplex a whole ghost train in FF6?
[5:06:55] <thedank> bad jill
[5:06:55] <%Froyuken> You said that already.
[5:06:57] <Zaphire_Saucypants> I love Chris for punching a goddamn boulder.
[5:06:58] <+Grayhammatter> D:
[5:06:58] <%scaryboisupreme> Thanks for nothing Rochard
[5:06:58] <%fruit_pie_the_magician> Punching the boulder is just the ultimate symbol of how that game turned all of it's characters into one dimensional cartoons

[5:15:02] <ittla> dragons dogma 2!!!!!!
[5:15:02] <lotharrio> Who else is waiting for all major publishers to just make their own announcement shows?
[5:15:03] <+photas10> did he have to mod it to make it look this good ?
[5:15:06] <%spiritofmojave> Would like Dragon's Dogma 2 before that honestly, but don't see that happening
[5:15:06] <%legendscar01> Save?
[5:15:08] <%spiritofmojave> :(
[5:15:09] <%THATGUY_789> that was a Snek attack
[5:15:14] <%Brojira> lol
[5:15:15] <Soulbishop> Do we think resistance is going to be a temp check to see if they can remake the Outbreak series?
[5:15:23] <Rashnam> I'm really glad they ditched the crimson mechanic for RE2. It was never great, and it would have been a nightmare to deal with in that game.
[5:15:24] <%IMDRanged> Your weapon is unloaded
[5:15:31] <%spongeofmystery> Run up to the camera change and waste him
[5:15:35] <%Yautjabutts> Imagine if Metal Gear Rising 2 gets announced before RE8

[5:15:41] <iamthatguy2016> be a big hero
[5:15:42] <Visored34> i want a REmake of 0, fix that shit please
[5:15:45] <+ShutUpAceyP> safety's on
[5:15:51] <%CalderGaming> @TheMaximiliAN0 not the best idea but if they share a common lower speed then the motherboard may run them both at that common speed
[5:15:53] <%Froyuken> Leave it!
[5:15:59] <Neo_Kaiser> Did you know that in the beta RE1 game that when Hunters sliced your head off they also grabbed it and started eating it?
[5:15:59] <%spongeofmystery> PUT IT BACK
[5:16:00] <Zaphire_Saucypants> @Yautjabutts I sincerely doubt that
[5:16:00] <%legendscar01> New Chris is not Boulder Chris
[5:16:05] <%natebud> i feel tricked
[5:16:13] <%D3rrtyD4n> yup
[5:16:13] <+Karebuncle> to fix 0 you'd have to make a completely different game, probably not even about rebecca.
[5:16:13] <TalisKanju> A remake of 0 would have to get rid of a lot about 0
[5:16:15] <+TheBitingIrish> I doubt 0 would get a remake, it's not very popular
[5:16:18] <RiverBirch> Put that thing back where it came from or so help me
[5:16:20] <RiverBirch> SO HELP ME!
[5:16:21] <%D3rrtyD4n> still gotta do battery

[5:16:49] <Soulbishop> @AngriestPat We still havent seen what a remake wesker looks like have we?
[5:16:49] <%Monkeyweed21> the way to fix RE0 is adding item boxes
[5:16:52] <%CalderGaming> the thing i'm looking forward to most in 0 is Pat saying billy's name in that voice again
[5:16:54] <FirearmsInstructor> NICE dodge

[5:20:15] <%natebud> he could have just used the regular magnum to kill the hunter.
