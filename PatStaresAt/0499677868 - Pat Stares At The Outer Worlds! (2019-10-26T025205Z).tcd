[0:03:33] <%RubberFistFight> @AngriestPat hey yeah panic_rabbit has raised an excellent point. Have you made sure the squirrels are not wearing tiny Bell uniforms? Maybe they were sent to sabotage you so that you would feel you had no choice but to switch.

[0:04:07] <%crimsonharvest> i would not recommend Destiny 2 because the menus and tooltips are garbage
[0:04:08] <12gagerager> @Shadicara Could it be the router?
[0:04:10] <SummonerMagno> Anyone who knows Funhaus, remember Adams internet install story?._. Yeah
[0:04:13] <Kemmybelle> the stream isn't over until the squirrels decide it's over.

[0:06:40] <%Shadicara> @12gagerager oh yeah faulty routers can do your net in. Usually hard to tell though
[0:06:42] <Gruhunchously> You can tell how much fun Pat is having by how bummed he is when the stream breaks.

[0:07:29] <WarchiefGoldva> I love that the quest's name is just called DIE, ROBOT
[0:07:29] <@Moobot> Hey, if you guys feel like checking out The Outer Worlds on account of this stream or cause you think I'm cool, go ahead and use this link https://bit.ly/2JmpB3Q to grab it off Greenman Gaming, and I'll get a few bucks kicked back. Thanks!

[0:08:22] <RyanTheRecluse> Ive seen it said that’d you go in the plant before talking to the greenhouse people that side of the main quest can fail
[0:08:32] <Bobbledygook> @acexclover if you like the idea of the combat of f04 and the dialogue/story of new vegas, this game is perfect for you
[0:08:37] <WarchiefGoldva> Raven or Starfire?
[0:08:47] <%AngriestAngryArtist> Terra :P
[0:08:49] <Monkeyweed21> @TheShisno get it on xbox its a dollar for 100 games

[0:09:15] <+PapermanXD> like a flamethrower but with electricity
[0:09:15] <%ape_hawk> get closer
[0:09:15] <%crimsonharvest> maybe its a point blank like a drill
[0:09:16] <Frostydough1> think amprex? and get closer?
[0:09:18] <ianabstract> It's a flamethrower
[0:09:19] <%IrritatedAvian> stun baton
[0:09:21] <Bogart4321> its like a shitty flame thrower
[0:09:26] <+VashyronM> melee gun

[0:09:39] <+Diamond_Dynamo> No, it's absolutely like a flamethrower
[0:09:40] <reiju_22> winston
[0:09:41] <%Shadicara> Literally the telsa gun from turock
[0:09:52] <+digital_gambitt> Its an electric flamethrower
[0:10:02] <tigerfang86> Tesla gun wew
[0:10:10] <Paperware> basically the arc thrower from NV
[0:10:15] <SvenHolgersson> I love how Obsidian is so well versed in these games they know whats cool and whats not
[0:10:28] <+Diamond_Dynamo> IIRC, its condition goes down really fast though
[0:10:28] <%Shadicara> turns out robots don't like electricity how can this be
[0:10:42] <+yasahiro1011> BUT THE BIG GETE STAR ALLOWED ME TO CHEAT DEATH
[0:10:43] <+yasahiro1011> HOW CAN THIS BE?

[0:10:56] <+TheShisno> Chat, do I get Outer Worlds on Epic or Windows store? I have no console
[0:10:56] <%WhereIsWill> I'm on the ouside
[0:11:04] <+spacehouse> Be this can how?
[0:11:16] <Gruhunchously> Would be cool if you could get a squirt gun that short-circuited the robots.
[0:11:31] <Monkeyweed21> You need to talk to the deserters before you go inside
[0:11:33] <Baeltyr> can you get on the roof?

[0:12:51] <ScreamLord> @AngriestPat I fucking hate that Moonman so much. He looks like Pops from Regular Show on crack
[0:13:05] <%ECRead> I don't trust that Moon logo fella around small children and animals
[0:13:10] <%RubberFistFight> Yeah that stress was real, dude. Sorry if suggesting a short LP came off as demanding or presumptuous. I just figured that making any kind of content would help keep you occupied during that period, versus just sitting and stewing over it. Which I know firsthand is a really bad thing to do.
[0:13:19] <%King_Wolf_Rigger> @ScreamLord You're super ight, he does look like him

[0:21:28] <zedravan> are mock apples just quinces? they look like quinces
[0:21:28] <based_versauen> Radiators are overkill. Feels like a sauna in here.
[0:21:37] <TDAWS_MP132> because people live here?
[0:21:40] <Bobbledygook> nah, is a apple
[0:21:44] <%ape_hawk> because the deserters are the best workers from the cannery
[0:21:46] <%crimsonharvest> because the people here are actually trying
[0:21:52] <Gorgen> The smart ones left
[0:21:54] <%ape_hawk> so, theyre actually skilled at stuff
[0:21:55] <%King_Wolf_Rigger> Probably cuz they ain't fuckin morons who give everything to an evil overlord
[0:22:04] <%Kataguro> Reed is dumb as rocks
[0:22:08] <@lewdskeletor13> Literally all the smart people left Edgewater

[0:22:54] <@lewdskeletor13> All these buildings used to be part of Edgewater, the town grew smaller as it declined
[0:22:54] <SparkAfterDark> because they are living tax free while siphoning utilities
[0:22:59] <%Shadicara> Literally cleaning the town out
[0:23:07] <$HyperionXV> Presumably the place with all the fruits and vegetables isnt dying of the plague like the place that only eats canned fish and more recently canned spacerats
[0:23:07] <Ner234> tbf these people wouldn't get robbed so easily if they didn't leave all there doors open and let random strangers waltz through there camp.
[0:23:12] <%King_Wolf_Rigger> I love how Parvati don't give a fuck and opens the doors for everyone to see.

[0:36:54] <%Meekest> Wait was that a core from Portal in the corner?
[0:36:56] <Monkeyweed21> its totally people
[0:37:05] <Fujiwara_92> Fertilizer huh
[0:37:07] <TheTunnelSn8ke> Except... I question the choice of fertilizer.
[0:37:07] <transporterthesequel> This area is hyper Bioshock
[0:37:14] <Torruun> I bet he just pooped in a corner, and something grew out of it
[0:37:15] <SparkAfterDark> "Organic compounds"
[0:37:18] <%King_Wolf_Rigger> @ape_hawk It's definitiely not people.
[0:37:23] <+Ablestron> honestly I would rather my body be made into fertilizer than be impunded by corporate cause my relatives couldnt afford to rent a graversite
[0:37:26] <Zalthia> Look at these people making a living away from capitalizm
[0:37:33] <wookie5358> probably poo
[0:37:33] <Magick_Man> The fertilizer is piss. We growing pisshrooms.

[0:38:45] <Sacksquatch> They're hippies
[0:38:47] <%King_Wolf_Rigger> @BreakingRatchet Nah, don't worry about it. It was the canabal marauders. Shh.
[0:38:51] <%dekkitout> AHHHHHHHHH-Commies!
[0:38:51] <Ion_Laser> Damn space hippies...
[0:38:52] <%Kataguro> Don't worry, Pat. She's cool.
[0:38:53] <hntronium> damn commies
[0:38:54] <Fujiwara_92> Welp
[0:38:54] <SparkAfterDark> They're still stealing electricity to make the whole thing run, so it's not like they're actually self sufficient.
[0:38:56] <%Run44forrest> huh
[0:38:57] <Dakuu75> ominous
[0:38:57] <%ape_hawk> yeah, its dead people

[0:39:16] <RyanTheRecluse> Big commie
[0:39:18] <%BreakingRatchet> better look cor them gold teeth
[0:39:19] <Goldenwolf98> this is so obvious
[0:39:20] <arkv01> this lady fucks on her fields to make them grow
[0:39:26] <SGrim> It's either just people or ground up people. That seems legit.
[0:39:29] <%dekkitout> Commie-hippies... they- they- THEY'RE BEATNIKS!
[0:39:33] <%Jack_of_No_Trades> Go back to Spacestock
[0:39:34] <%Kataguro> Use Love Juice to make the crops grow good
[0:39:37] <%CalderGaming> @Parapattern fertilizing with human shit can spread disease, which is a detail I figure they'd catch in this game
[0:39:38] <aeonicvector> @Parapattern not all feces is created equal, cow manure is used for a reason
[0:39:38] <SparkAfterDark> These fools are gonna get prions
[0:39:57] <+SpaghettiPuncher> Lizardmen
[0:39:59] <Goldenwolf98> THE REPTILIANS
[0:40:05] <%Run44forrest> 3
[0:40:10] <deafmutelaughing> I wasn't really listening
[0:40:14] <Parapattern> I'd think dead bodies would also cause disease if used as fertilizer
[0:40:15] <%mh9s> eyyyyyyyyyyyyyy
[0:40:18] <tigerfang86> NICE
[0:40:20] <tigerfang86> NICEEEE
[0:40:20] <Gruhunchously> Oh snap
[0:40:21] <Bobbledygook> fuck she got us
[0:40:24] <%dekkitout> That last option is a whole ass mood
[0:40:35] <%Run44forrest> i dont
[0:40:36] <%CalderGaming> fair point
[0:40:43] <%King_Wolf_Rigger> I think you only get prions by eating flesh, not from the fruit grown by fertilizing the earth with bodies.
[0:40:45] <SvenHolgersson> decision TIMEEEEEEE
[0:40:46] <LilMKatsu> PogChamp
[0:40:47] <Fear_Ranjer> Sounds good!

[0:41:08] <Bobbledygook> and then Spacer's Choice sends in the death squads
[0:41:09] <+SpaghettiPuncher> Oh it's the Helios plant
[0:41:09] <Zalthia> Would the people in Edgewater get in trouble if you did that?
[0:41:09] <hntronium> communist hero
[0:41:12] <KaliasTV> Don't you want to be a hero :)
[0:41:12] <Goldenwolf98> BURN THEM BOTH DOWN
[0:41:12] <Sedrelic> kill her
[0:41:13] <%Jack_of_No_Trades> I was onboard until she called you a hero
[0:41:14] <%Kataguro> Who's it going to be, Pat? Followers of the Apocalypse or the NCR?
[0:41:17] <Gruhunchously> She's got a point.
[0:41:18] <TheTunnelSn8ke> So this sounds like Helios One.
[0:41:18] <Fujiwara_92> KILL THEM BOLTH
[0:41:20] <+fingalights> kill them all
[0:41:22] <%dekkitout> Wait- do we get a space laser out of this too?
[0:41:23] <tigerfang86> OOF
[0:41:24] <%audrus> you must decide how to distribute power from the Apollo plant
[0:41:26] <SvenHolgersson> BURN IT lytBADMAN
[0:41:27] <tigerfang86> OOOOOOOF
[0:41:27] <%ape_hawk> jeez, that popin
[0:41:30] <SGrim> @King_Wolf_Rigger considering most places have dead bodies buried in them, yes plants grown in cadaver soil are fine.
[0:41:33] <SparkAfterDark> cool so she's exactly the same as reed, not better. She wants you to do exactly the same thing as him, not find a better solution
[0:41:35] <Bobbledygook> yike
[0:41:36] <Zalthia> Always Followers of the Apocalypse
[0:41:38] <Dakuu75> he could've had HEART disease for all you know
[0:41:39] <+Ablestron> thats super rude tho to tell that to her face
[0:41:44] <+rdark_ksu> right but its the only stability they know
[0:41:44] <%Kataguro> Pat loves Cheese
[0:41:52] <%senorpapel> Hey pat, congratz on purging the redbars. Also i wanted to add something about the loot discussion you had with woolie. You brought up a plethora or convoluted and useless loot. That’s actually what has been killing wow this expac. Top 100 guilds have to use third party software to figure out if an item is even an upgrade.
[0:41:53] <+Grayhammatter> pat wants the cheese
[0:41:54] <%ape_hawk> she isnt sorry
[0:41:54] <Goldenwolf98> I dont trust this old bag
[0:41:57] <Gruhunchously> It's great that you get that dialogue option.
[0:41:57] <%King_Wolf_Rigger> HOLY SHIT! That's never an option in dialogue. I love it!

[0:42:50] <Gruhunchously> Yeah, but how can your tiny camp support that many displaced workers?
[0:42:56] <Bobbledygook> or they come and murder you for destroying their lives?
[0:42:57] <Fear_Ranjer> Killing them AND making the cannery workers lives worse.
[0:43:04] <SvenHolgersson> CONSCIENCE SAYS BURNNNNNNN
[0:43:04] <TheTunnelSn8ke> Edgewater, for all its ills, has infrastructure.
[0:43:05] <%Meekest> I really like that you can call her out on being manipulative

[0:45:49] <RocketShot_> its like
[0:45:49] <EuropanLamprey> Burn the spoiler trolls at the stake!
[0:45:51] <SGrim> @yasahiro1011 Bruce Willis was dead the whole time

[0:45:56] <%trianglebody> apatHoldon
[0:45:57] <Zalthia> In the long run, no matter what you do here, it wont solve the problem that is that people are being stomped on by the coroporations.
[0:45:58] <@lewdskeletor13> I leave for one minute and spoils happen? apatWhat
[0:46:00] <+PerrinIsDead> Fuckin chat
[0:46:00] <SparkAfterDark> it's definitely bad farming practice. you're asking for disease by doing that shit
[0:46:02] <SvenHolgersson> God remember when you got that donation that spoiled the new Berserk chapter LUL
[0:46:03] <fruit_pie_the_magician> Lucky I read the chat cursorily at most
[0:46:08] <Zalthia> ohhhh wowww this corporate speak

[0:46:10] <+yasahiro1011> @SGrim fuckin Jolyne
[0:46:10] <SvenHolgersson> people are fucking stupid
[0:46:10] <Torruun> Cool. Now we just have to figure out where the fuck the third edition is.
[0:46:10] <Dakuu75> @ape_hawk I wouldn't consider it so. but, an arguement could be made for the ladder, yeah
[0:46:11] <%goose_attack_almanac> @lewdskeletor13 From :Paige of all places
[0:46:12] <Dementedpenguin> "I'm further ahead than you. You need to know DansGame "
[0:46:12] <%dekkitout> "Pat had never seen such bullshit"
[0:46:12] <Huntercd> It wouldn't be cannibalism if the person is dead
[0:46:13] <fatally_furious> @ape_hawk i mean, you cannabilize parts from computers so i'd say it counts
[0:46:16] <%Run44forrest> whats wrong with using humans as fertilizer?
[0:46:19] <42nfl19> @AngriestPat Given enough time would you try and find a THIRD option and not side with either side or some how unite them?
[0:46:20] <Bobbledygook> jesus this is fucked
[0:46:20] <%King_Wolf_Rigger> @SGrim Is that how he ignored the glass in his feet?

[0:46:31] <Gruhunchously> @Huntercd Yes it would...
[0:46:38] <WarchiefGoldva> Well, you were planning on burning this town to the ground anyway!
[0:46:38] <Bobbledygook> Reed has the fat evil
[0:46:38] <KaliasTV> Bringing plague to work is the best medicine
[0:46:40] <RocketShot_> this game is really pretty
[0:46:41] <tigerfang86> Just work until you're not sick
[0:46:41] <+nekodelic> using human flesh as fertilizer is not cannibalism. wtf are you on about, chat?
[0:46:44] <RocketShot_> i like the art style
[0:46:45] <wookie5358> I think eating dead people still counts as cannibalism
[0:46:46] <RocketShot_> and the colors
[0:46:48] <SvenHolgersson> IF YOURE SICK JUST RUN A MILE
[0:46:49] <SvenHolgersson> PUSSY
[0:46:50] <TheTunnelSn8ke> I wonder what the middleground will be, if such an outcome exists.
[0:46:51] <%floralkami> Have we even seen that character yet?
[0:46:52] <%Townspoon> goddamn this is like 99% fallout
[0:46:56] <%ChaosVulpes> Work work work. Where there's a whip, there's a way!
[0:46:56] <Thorn14> I regret my decisipn in this planet. Oh well
[0:47:03] <RocketShot_> but the good parts of fallout
[0:47:04] <42nfl19> @AngriestPat I feel like this game is open enough that you could find more options to solve this quest
[0:47:09] <RocketShot_> thomas looks fucked up
[0:47:09] <%BreakingRatchet> 3rd option is move in
[0:47:09] <%Run44forrest> id rather eat people than those space dog things
[0:47:12] <Edible_Enthusiasm> wait. wasn't it said that they were actively giving the plauge to the residents who couldn't work?
[0:47:19] <SvenHolgersson> Oh god his face is like reptile's
[0:47:19] <SGrim> @King_Wolf_Rigger yes. Also how he managed to survive on that asteroid so long.
[0:47:24] <Thorn14> Can't get the golden ending for everything!
[0:47:24] <Dakuu75> "ironicle" oh I don't like that, lol
[0:47:25] <Bobbledygook> the bubonic plague could've been solved if everyone just went for a run
[0:47:25] <%Goobbue> Something about these dialog animations is really unsettling to me
[0:47:27] <Dementedpenguin> >_>
[0:47:29] <Junkles> this guy is liam
[0:47:30] <Parapattern> Ironical. It's a very cromulent word.
[0:47:30] <%floralkami> Ironical
[0:47:34] <%Run44forrest> hes fine
[0:47:35] <%King_Wolf_Rigger> oh god, Ironical. kill me now
[0:47:36] <TheTunnelSn8ke> Just need Volume 3.
[0:47:38] <Edible_Enthusiasm> or was it that someone got the plauge by eatting off someone elses plate
[0:47:40] <Bobbledygook> liam when did your eyes get so pretty
[0:47:45] <squirtkitten> Where's Rick from Rick and Morty that was in the trailer? tobiasLUL

[0:48:43] <Gruhunchously> Bunny hop
[0:48:44] <WarchiefGoldva> I also wonder if Plague's ever gonna pass.
[0:48:46] <%floralkami> @arkv01 nope, Spore~ sacs!

[0:48:57] <%King_Wolf_Rigger> @arkv01 Don't worry about the milkers on the insect thing

[0:50:50] <Thorn14> FORTUNA
[0:50:51] <Flarepulse> please gun this man down
[0:50:52] <%audrus> this game has incredible ear physics like what the fuck
[0:50:52] <jack_s1n> burn town
[0:50:55] <%ChaosVulpes> He sounds like a cultist
[0:50:57] <%BreakingRatchet> dude is indoctrinated as fuck
[0:50:58] <Junkles> we suck that corporate dick because we love it
[0:51:00] <VERDAXY> Communism IN SPACE
[0:51:03] <Lord_of_all_Edges> We're a family. We're a family. DO YOU BELIEVE WE'RE A FAMILY NOW?
[0:51:03] <Bobbledygook> Money family... family.. family...
[0:51:06] <ArtoriasTheTrenchfighter> Ugh

[0:51:28] <Dementedpenguin> "gets my bile up" is not a term I wanna hear again
[0:51:28] <%Conyst> Capitalism
[0:51:32] <@lewdskeletor13> Cause it’s just the flu you dumbass
[0:51:33] <Decsevm> no that's not how it works
[0:51:34] <%floralkami> Thank you for swallowing that bit of soul in your voice earlier, this makes it easier to shoot you later
[0:51:34] <squirtkitten> What if the plague is a lie? tobiasSWEAT
[0:51:39] <Gruhunchously> Medical care? Immunization?
[0:51:41] <%Marpolo13> LUL
[0:51:41] <Goldenwolf98> LUL
[0:51:42] <Bobbledygook> JESUS
[0:51:43] <%Dr_Mooose> wow
[0:51:43] <Thorn14> THAT'S NOT HOW DISEASES WORK
[0:51:45] <+Diamond_Dynamo> I'd argue he's less a bad person, and more just indoctrinated that he thinks bad things are good. He genuinely feels that he's doing the best he can for the people he's in charge of. I feel pity for him, more than hatred
[0:51:48] <%ape_hawk> its the fucking FLU
[0:51:48] <+rdark_ksu> corporate can eat a bag of horse dicks
[0:51:48] <Thorn14> AAAAAAA

[0:52:17] <Thorn14> F A M I L Y
[0:52:18] <+Grayhammatter> time to burn this shit to the ground
[0:52:19] <Gruhunchously> Family family family
[0:52:19] <Goldenwolf98> at least he knows hes an ass hat
[0:52:20] <transporterthesequel> ALSO a commie!
[0:52:20] <Monkeyweed21> KEEP TALKING
[0:52:22] <+nekodelic> "I can't save everyone from something I've caused"
[0:52:24] <+rdark_ksu> what if we just burn both places down?
[0:52:25] <transporterthesequel> BUISNESS COMMIE!

[0:52:40] <Monkeyweed21> He has more to say Pat
[0:52:41] <%King_Wolf_Rigger> eating rats and nothing but meat all day every day.
[0:52:42] <@commanderclaw> It could easily be scurvy, they only eat meat
[0:52:43] <%Puhff> That dude fucks
[0:52:44] <%Conyst> And nothing but rats
[0:52:45] <bear_breaker20> so when is this game about corporate evil gonna get into epstien territory?
[0:52:47] <%AgentOrangeShoes> Nuke it from orbit, it's the only way to be sure
[0:52:48] <%nicos143> Can't you eat rats if cooked properly though?
[0:52:48] <%ape_hawk> edgewater is a cocktail of problems, pat
[0:52:52] <wookie5358> diagnosis: poison. treatment: fire.
[0:52:52] <%ChaosVulpes> The only way to solve this problem... EXTERMINATUS
[0:52:53] <@Moobot> Hey, if you guys feel like checking out The Outer Worlds on account of this stream or cause you think I'm cool, go ahead and use this link https://bit.ly/2JmpB3Q to grab it off Greenman Gaming, and I'll get a few bucks kicked back. Thanks!
[0:52:54] <Huntercd> Feed him a bullet Pat @AngriestPat
[0:52:55] <%Marpolo13> hey if you get sick our immune system should just be better Kappa
[0:52:58] <42nfl19> As an industrial engineer I can understand what his view is
[0:53:00] <Nerdwarp112> Is this the type of game where if you wanted to you could have murdered him right there?
[0:53:01] <%audrus> But how did the rats get here they can't swim through space?
[0:53:01] <Ner234> Wow rude Pat
[0:53:02] <Edible_Enthusiasm> Elmo is a fluffy molting rat
[0:53:03] <+nekodelic> @transporterthesequel collectivism is not exclusive a commie thing
[0:53:04] <%floralkami> He has more to say apparently
[0:53:07] <Frog_of_Justic> BURN IT TO THE GROUND PAT
[0:53:11] <CrabSlacks> rats would probably be better than nothing but fish and salt
[0:53:13] <Gruhunchously> @Nerdwarp112 Yes
[0:53:13] <@lewdskeletor13> The giant rat that makes all of the rules
[0:53:18] <%BreakingRatchet> not food poisoning, bad cold that they can't fight due to malnutrition and exahustion

[0:54:24] <%floralkami> @SvenHolgersson Moon Man. Deadass
[0:54:24] <@lewdskeletor13> Everything loops around eventually, don’t worry
[0:54:25] <%ChaosVulpes> I just call the MoonMan 'Pops'
[0:54:28] <+spacehouse> feed him a bullet of the truth, easy to kill some1, but destroying their identity is much sweeter
[0:54:29] <+Diamond_Dynamo> How's the maintenance on that gun doing?
[0:54:30] <12gagerager> I think the moon man is a shot at the fallout mascot, and i love it.
[0:54:32] <SvenHolgersson> Good
[0:54:36] <Bobbledygook> @ChaosVulpes fuck that's good
[0:54:38] <wookie5358> hammertime

[0:54:50] <SvenHolgersson> Damn Parv the BLOODLUST
[0:54:53] <Thorn14> HAMMERDOWN
[0:54:56] <VERDAXY> good shit
[0:55:01] <%Maids4lyfe> Parvati is great
[0:55:04] <Parapattern> That moon man's creepy stare reminds me of the eyes of Doctor T.J. Eckleburg.
[0:55:04] <Dementedpenguin> Cheese Girl doing it.
[0:55:04] <%floralkami> @ChaosVulpes don't you lump Pops with that ghoul
[0:55:06] <Gruhunchously> That guy is probably like 'God I wish that were me'
[0:55:06] <@lewdskeletor13> Parvati enjoys violence a little too much
[0:55:10] <SvenHolgersson> God she's hot when shes murdering defenseless robots
[0:55:10] <Goldenwolf98> HA
[0:55:11] <+Diamond_Dynamo> Can't be bloodlust when they don't have blood
[0:55:16] <arkv01> parvati, the destroyer
[0:55:22] <+mgskomododragon> Rustlust
[0:55:25] <SvenHolgersson> The Final Parvati
[0:55:26] <+twohitgood> it'd be hilarious if you actually could hit your head on that spot that says "mind your head"
[0:55:28] <Bobbledygook> parvati is the most badass and sweetest person
[0:55:28] <based_versauen> I'm gonna tap out to avoid spoiling anymore of this. Definitely picking this game up when I can afford it.
[0:55:29] <%Marpolo13> @Diamond_Dynamo oilust?
[0:55:34] <Gruhunchously> She's Kaylee with an enormous hammer.
[0:55:42] <Huntercd> There isn't a thing as too much violence
[0:55:42] <wookie5358> paravati proves that there's merit to a braver attack
[0:55:43] <RyanTheRecluse> There’s some real fun characters in this game I can’t wait for pat to run into
[0:55:45] <+Diamond_Dynamo> @Marpolo13 Damn it, I was literally about to say that
[0:55:49] <42nfl19> Have you tried to see if the priest is available for a party member yet? @AngriestPat
[0:55:49] <fruit_pie_the_magician> It's that damn Parvati. She's so hot right now

[0:56:21] <Ner234> LUL
[0:56:22] <Bobbledygook> i love the term "automechanical"
[0:56:29] <wookie5358> if mechanical never breaks down, why does internet suck
[0:56:31] <RyanTheRecluse> Has pat got the book for priest guy yet?
[0:56:36] <%floralkami> Oh, so he's crazy and completely alone with robots
[0:56:38] <Ner234> THE UPRISING
[0:56:39] <Gruhunchously> The company treats robots more humanely than the humans.
[0:56:40] <@lewdskeletor13> Yes
[0:56:43] <Goldenwolf98> LUL
[0:56:47] <tigerfang86> DRINK YOUR PROBLEMS AWAY

[0:56:58] <Monkeyweed21> need a key
[0:56:59] <+Diamond_Dynamo> Git gud
[0:56:59] <Goldenwolf98> the snark in this game is great
[0:57:00] <%Marpolo13> tldr: shits wack
[0:57:04] <%AgentOrangeShoes> Sacrifice your liver for less problems in your life
[0:57:05] <%ChaosVulpes> An ale that's good for what ails you. That's a catchy slogan...
[0:57:08] <Flarepulse> please drink Authorization Mountain Dew to continue
[0:57:14] <Huntercd> Of fucking course the cheap company robots are fucked
[0:57:19] <%InugamiTheHound> I can't find a work bench in the city
[0:57:25] <RyanTheRecluse> Damn I missed his reaction to the priest receiving the book.
[0:57:26] <Parapattern> @Gruhunchously Robots are better workers than people and thus more valuable for the bottom line
[0:57:32] <%CaityCoopScoops> good night, everyone. remember: BURN IT ALL DOWN
[0:57:39] <Ner234> @RyanTheRecluse It was awesome

[0:57:52] <Goldenwolf98> @CaityCoopScoops Especially the children Kappa gnite
[0:57:59] <ALazo> For a while I didn't see the left handle on the weapon and the way the character was holding its left arm up within view was making me really uncomfortable
[0:58:01] <%King_Wolf_Rigger> @CaityCoopScoops g'night! All will burn!
[0:58:11] <@lewdskeletor13> Yeah when I gave Max the book in my playthrough I couldn’t wait to see Pats reaction
[0:58:12] <wookie5358> makes sense. squirrels like nuts @Bobbledygook
[0:58:25] <%Marpolo13> schedule your ass beating LUL
[0:58:29] <Thorn14> Did Pat do so yet?

[0:59:43] <transporterthesequel> Killed them for the MONEY
[0:59:43] <Thorn14> Fuuuuck Spacerd Choice
[0:59:44] <fusedforms> haha insurance fraud
[0:59:45] <tigerfang86> INSURANCE FUCKIN FRAUD
[0:59:46] <Bobbledygook> don't you dare understandu
[0:59:46] <SpaceGuntank> double backstab!
[0:59:47] <Sacksquatch> Thrown under the bus
[0:59:47] <ALazo> INSURANCE FRAUD
[0:59:49] <+Estuko> FUCK
[0:59:50] <+Grayhammatter> that's FUCKED
[0:59:54] <TheTunnelSn8ke> Fucking planned obsolescence
[0:59:54] <Huntercd> Christ in heaven
[0:59:59] <bear_breaker20> just like california
[1:00:01] <Gruhunchously> Great
[1:00:03] <KasiCrafter> Planned obsolescence, baby!
[1:00:04] <Parapattern> I'm surprised these corporations haven't just started mass executing people who aren't viable workers.
[1:00:06] <dickbuttwoman> No pat, DON'T extrapolate that!
[1:00:09] <dickbuttwoman> It said so in the email!
[1:00:10] <Dakuu75> @bear_breaker20 too real
[1:00:12] <%dekkitout> Ol reliable forced obsolescence
[1:00:15] <Edible_Enthusiasm> you have a mountain of evidence against them
[1:00:15] <$HyperionXV> So even if you burn it down, you're sitll helping the corporation
[1:00:17] <Thorn14> Spacers Choice is COMICALLY corrupt
[1:00:18] <+spacehouse> Endgame Capitalism
[1:00:20] <Frog_of_Justic> WoooooooooooH boooooi
[1:00:23] <%goose_attack_almanac> It's not the best choice. It's Spacers Choice
[1:00:25] <TDAWS_MP132> if you ever meet the spacer's choice ceo, you need to shoot them
[1:00:28] <TDAWS_MP132> on sight
[1:00:29] <%Curua> You'd think mega-capitalists would be smart enough NOT to sell each other insurance by now.
[1:00:30] <transporterthesequel> So the argument against keeping things the way they are, is that you can NEVER fix Spacer's Choice
[1:00:32] <wookie5358> if there's one thing video games taught me, it's to never trust a man in a suit
[1:00:33] <Goldenwolf98> But Pat what if they ask you to sell out would you do it? Kappa
[1:00:38] <TyrantBelial> They outright m,urdered these people by upgradfing the robots.
[1:00:39] <Edible_Enthusiasm> hes not dead :c he's just sleeping
[1:00:42] <NeroInfinite> A mountain of evidence, but what lawyers?
[1:00:42] <Edible_Enthusiasm> forever
[1:00:43] <%floralkami> PLEASE tell me you can bring this info back to Reed
[1:00:43] <Huntercd> Bring down the Hammer Pat @AngriestPat
[1:00:53] <Gruhunchously> That's a good point, even if we torch this place, the company will still probably take a profit.
[1:00:53] <aeonicvector> @wookie5358 what about a man in TWO suits
[1:00:55] <%floralkami> Before you shoot him in the face
[1:00:57] <Zalthia> Hi
[1:00:58] <arkv01> when do we find the alex jones of this universe
[1:01:00] <+nekodelic> @parapattern letting them die by not providing medical treatment makes it easier to keep the façade
[1:01:01] <Dakuu75> @TDAWS_MP132 there might be some thing where you OWN spacer's choice. seems possible
[1:01:07] <Thorn14> GOD
[1:01:15] <Edible_Enthusiasm> @NeroInfinite pat can be the judge, jury and executioner :D
[1:01:22] <Thorn14> FUCK THIS COMPANY
[1:01:24] <%Cthulos> hey pat
[1:01:32] <KoyaMusa> can the efficiency be improved or no?
[1:01:32] <hntronium> I DONT WANT YOUR LEMONADE yes
[1:01:36] <Bobbledygook> "GOD" - the slogan for this game in general
[1:01:36] <Goldenwolf98> TERRAFORM THE PLANET
[1:01:36] <Sacksquatch> there was another door
[1:01:40] <%ChaosVulpes> Built to die, world is a fuck.
[1:01:43] <+neonNeptunian> today's lesson: f u c k capitalism
[1:01:50] <hntronium> I'LL BURN YOUR HOUSE DOWN WITH LEMONS damn corps
[1:01:51] <+Ablestron> they built a cannery for a fish that isnt even native to the fucking planet
[1:01:52] <@lewdskeletor13> “I can’t believe it got even worse!”
[1:01:53] <Thorn14> Bobby do you mean LAW?
[1:01:59] <TheTunnelSn8ke> Guess we reroute power to the hippie?
[1:02:09] <SpaceGuntank> when life gives you lemons give them back! demand to see life's manager! they'll rue the day they gave cave johnson lemons!
[1:02:11] <Edible_Enthusiasm> Mr. Ouch
[1:02:11] <NeroInfinite> He tried
[1:02:13] <%Cthulos> @bobbledygook is that just a thing or is there some connotation to that I should read into
[1:02:17] <Bobbledygook> 410,757,864,530 dead workers
[1:02:26] <Thorn14> The hippies suck too
[1:02:30] <Torruun> So this is just speculation, but I wonder if you can fix the plant enough to give power to both communities.
[1:02:32] <%dekkitout> So that guy was kinda right about the robo-uprising
[1:02:38] <Edible_Enthusiasm> is there a third option
[1:02:39] <%Marpolo13> @Bobbledygook they should have worked harder
[1:02:44] <Dakuu75> I'm going to escape to the ONE place uncorrupted by Capitalism... SPACE~!!!
[1:02:45] <Goldenwolf98> Everyone sucks on this planet just blow it up
[1:02:45] <zedravan> this are some fresh looking corpses
[1:02:47] <transporterthesequel> Yeah, I assume the robots they provided "malfunctioned" and killed all the people
[1:02:57] <+nekodelic> @thorn14 how so?
[1:03:00] <%Marpolo13> @Dakuu75 about that... Kappa
[1:03:05] <wookie5358> parvati used braver. it's super effective
[1:03:05] <%King_Wolf_Rigger> BOPPED
[1:03:06] <%Dr_Mooose> bopped
[1:03:08] <bear_breaker20> the slippery slope fallacy isnt a fallacy, robots are coming for ya <3
[1:03:11] <Dakuu75> @Marpolo13 lmao
[1:03:13] <lols_royce> is stealth archer a class in this game?
[1:03:14] <+rdark_ksu> ok I for this entire time thought her name was Pavarati like that fat singer
[1:03:16] <Bobbledygook> @Cthulos nah it's just that this whole universe is so fucking morbidly corprate that all you can say is "god"
[1:03:16] <LilMKatsu> Bopt it, Pull it, Spin it
[1:03:18] <Gruhunchously> Smash
[1:03:20] <grayjammer> Bop it! Twist it! Shake it! Spin it!
[1:03:27] <+smacksfenton> Does pat like the game so far guys?
[1:03:31] <@lewdskeletor13> To my eyes the Botanical community is far an away better than Corporate Feudalism
[1:03:33] <Goldenwolf98> wtf
[1:03:33] <Thorn14> The hippies are cruel too. Don't want to spoil
[1:03:35] <CrabSlacks> do you get more experience when Parvati kills things?

[1:05:58] <@lewdskeletor13> @gruhunchously The company
[1:06:03] <Gruhunchously> Oh may god, if there's a 'woke' company in this game I'm gonna scream.
[1:06:14] <%floralkami> @Gruhunchously the company
[1:06:19] <%Curua> Probably from some guy. Some guy named Chester.
[1:06:21] <Goldenwolf98> @Gruhunchously YOU FUCKIN KNOW THERE IS GOING TO BE ONE

[1:07:43] <SGrim> @dekkitout Of course he's a solid navigator. He is a monster truck after all.
[1:07:44] <bear_breaker20> still hilarious that they cant get true ladders in these games atpCap
[1:07:45] <Parapattern> Is there a company that's like "Yeah burn down the system, man!" while selling you their merch?

[1:13:44] <%SmoothFriend> SmoothFriend subscribed at Tier 1. They've subscribed for 18 months! Oh hey, I didn't know that Outer Wilds was out already!
[1:13:45] <%Dylveryn> @implied_consent he loves it
[1:13:46] <+Diamond_Dynamo> Honestly, it's just because it wants you to try to reroute power and find out you need to keep exploring
[1:13:47] <dickbuttwoman> I think lockpick might be even more vital here than it is in NV and 3
[1:13:54] <Edible_Enthusiasm> ((world))
[1:14:10] <%Kiiper> I've got lockpick at 50 and barely have to use picks
[1:14:23] <%King_Wolf_Rigger> Wow that's garbage. I'd've figured Riot gear would be good.
[1:14:25] <NeroInfinite> JEREMy NO
[1:14:28] <transporterthesequel> OH JEREMY NOOO
[1:14:30] <+shaderichter_belmont> nooooo Jeremy

[1:14:54] <%Marpolo13> lirikOSVN
[1:14:55] <%InugamiTheHound> Jeremy no!!! aka "Monster truck" aka"lil J" aka "boston tea party"
[1:14:59] <Gruhunchously> F
[1:15:00] <@lewdskeletor13> Pat just looted him
[1:15:01] <%Run44forrest> yeah pat just looted him
[1:15:01] <WarchiefGoldva> Parvati reminds me a LOT of the priest girl from Pillars 2.
[1:15:02] <Bobbledygook> Jerry?
[1:15:03] <+Grayhammatter> F
[1:15:05] <%InugamiTheHound> xcalF
[1:15:07] <@lewdskeletor13> He was a good robo boy
[1:15:10] <Thorn14> My Jeremy didn't die because I killed everything before he got ot them
[1:15:12] <+mgskomododragon> poor jeremy
[1:15:14] <dalishprince> pat didnt even noticed he looted his dead grave :(
[1:15:20] <Gruhunchously> To pure for this rotten world
[1:15:29] <+majorchange> how much fallout is this? some of hte ui reminds me of bioshock
[1:15:31] <Goldenwolf98> YOU MONSTER
[1:15:34] <%ChaosVulpes> Pat didn't seem particularly upset in the least. XD
[1:15:34] <%dekkitout> May you shine on forever in robo-Valhalla, you crazy automaton
[1:15:58] <+Diamond_Dynamo> I honestly wonder if it'll screw up dialogue that you've done this kinda out of order
[1:16:10] <12gagerager> Parvati is just killing it.
[1:16:16] <+metzselaar> She’s got your back!
[1:16:18] <@lewdskeletor13> I fought through all of this before I got Higgins card so I had to kill them all
[1:16:44] <Goldenwolf98> That shit was leaking
[1:16:48] <Gruhunchously> Historically, Obsidian games are pretty tight about incorporating sequence breaking into dialogue, so here's hoping.
[1:16:51] <Dakuu75> leaky pipes
[1:16:52] <+shaderichter_belmont> oh good its leaking magma
[1:16:52] <+majorchange> slurp it up
[1:17:03] <%InugamiTheHound> you can climb ladders in real time, you couldn't do that fallout games
[1:17:05] <%ogtrashwizard> cyber hotsauce
[1:17:09] <%Marpolo13> what could go wrong
[1:17:16] <%King_Wolf_Rigger> Don't worry about the magma leaks, it's fine
[1:17:17] <Archmortal> IS it good thta it's leaking so much everywhere?
[1:17:27] <NeroInfinite> Is it possible to savejeremy?
[1:17:28] <tigerfang86> hmmmm
[1:17:29] <+metzselaar> I’m glad Jeremy died protecting Pat, unlike in my run where he was a mini boss fight
[1:17:33] <tigerfang86> Hmmmmmm
[1:17:37] <+majorchange> dont forget to save joe
[1:17:50] <+GimmMeUhSammich> BEST COMPUTER ENTRY IN THE GAME COMING UP
[1:17:53] <%rumtumtugnutz> i wonder where it pipes the molten hot smegma to
[1:18:02] <Gruhunchously> A mini boss fight huh?
[1:18:07] <+GimmMeUhSammich> he skipped it...
[1:18:13] <%King_Wolf_Rigger> SPACER'S. choice

[1:21:07] <@lewdskeletor13> No you won’t
[1:21:14] <%Marpolo13> it's okay you have the power of SAVE SCUM on your side
[1:21:16] <RyanTheRecluse> @angriestpat you won’t
[1:21:16] <NeroInfinite> It was built to fail.
[1:21:17] <dickbuttwoman> That ain't gonna change
[1:21:20] <+GimmMeUhSammich> You increased the output, no the efficency
[1:21:22] <wookie5358> not as much fire as I hoped, but it'll do
[1:21:24] <@commanderclaw> Yeah, it's stuck at 22
[1:21:27] <arkv01> but number...
[1:21:28] <$GoogleyGareth> I think it stays like that yeah
[1:21:31] <+shaderichter_belmont> pat no one is alive to work the plant
[1:21:36] <Siebersboy> its a shithole so it only has enough power for one place
[1:21:38] <SpaceGuntank> 22.99% now that you fixed it
[1:21:38] <+shaderichter_belmont> its not gonna get more efficient
[1:21:42] <%Marpolo13> it's be FIIIIIIINNNNNEEEEE
[1:21:45] <+Diamond_Dynamo> If you'd tried to redirect power before, it would've told you to go do those switches
[1:21:50] <hntronium> Booo
[1:21:51] <+Grayhammatter> this is fine
[1:21:52] <Goldenwolf98> save has been scummed its fine

[1:22:37] <+digital_gambitt> @AngriestPat Edgewater was the everyone wins option
[1:22:37] <MageSonic> redboiKermit redboiKermit redboiKermit redboiKermit
[1:22:37] <%AnIcedCoffee> There is a third option, sort of
[1:22:38] <Goldenwolf98> I wanted the sell out powers to win
[1:22:39] <dagreenpillow> it's like the sun ray quest in new vegas
[1:22:40] <Dakuu75> what'd he pick?
[1:22:41] <Gruhunchously> Did he do it?
[1:22:41] <SGrim> @Run44forrest death to townies
[1:22:44] <arkv01> SHOOT HER
[1:22:46] <Thorn14> There IS a good ending to this

[1:22:48] <%floralkami> Burn it all down
[1:22:48] <wookie5358> tell her your finger slipped. it'll be fine
[1:22:49] <deafmutelaughing> eh she doesn't care
[1:22:51] <%AgentOrangeShoes> GET SMASHED
[1:22:51] <SpaceGuntank> "whatever"
[1:22:52] <+Diamond_Dynamo> Interesting. I went with Edgewater, because I figured there were more people and more infrastructure, so it would be better for everyone
[1:22:53] <%Dr_Mooose> she can't even talk to you
[1:22:54] <dalishprince> shes fine with it
[1:22:55] <Thorn14> She's not gonna kill you over it Pat
[1:22:57] <%TaifuDragon> Bad end achieved
[1:23:05] <+shaderichter_belmont> best ending
[1:23:06] <Mushball> anprim grug gang
[1:23:06] <@Moobot> Hey, if you guys feel like checking out The Outer Worlds on account of this stream or cause you think I'm cool, go ahead and use this link https://bit.ly/2JmpB3Q to grab it off Greenman Gaming, and I'll get a few bucks kicked back. Thanks!
[1:23:06] <+digital_gambitt> bad end lol
[1:23:07] <RyanTheRecluse> That’s like a whole town vs like 20 people
[1:23:08] <%Marpolo13> what if you sent it to down but killed reed? is that a thing?
[1:23:10] <tigerfang86> GOOD ENDING
[1:23:12] <TDAWS_MP132> check your rep?
[1:23:12] <%Marpolo13> town*
[1:23:14] <Thorn14> There is a golden ending
[1:23:15] <RushUnplugged> there IS apparently a third option (that I couldn't get personally) but it makes nobody happy
[1:23:15] <%Run44forrest> they better leave town
[1:23:16] <+twohitgood> the town people can thrive with the deserters
[1:23:16] <+GimmMeUhSammich> @Marpolo13 that is a thing
[1:23:17] <%Dr_Mooose> they can leave and be deserters, win-win
[1:23:19] <Siebersboy> Diamond_Dynamo I was torn for the same reason but ended up with the garden because fuck the corps
[1:23:19] <@lewdskeletor13> Anyone who’s smart will move to the botanical gardens
[1:23:19] <Goldenwolf98> worse end Kappa
[1:23:20] <+Lost_Zombie> Marauders gonna have a real nice home at the tree farm that's got all that power and no walls
[1:23:24] <%Marpolo13> @GimmMeUhSammich interesting
[1:23:24] <Parapattern> You mean what the town was built to do?
[1:23:25] <%TaifuDragon> I got the third option that makes EVERYONE happy
[1:23:30] <tigerfang86> Third option fucking sucks lmao
[1:23:31] <Thorn14> Yeah there's an EVERYONE WINS ending
[1:23:37] <Gruhunchously> Cool
[1:23:37] <SpaceGuntank> all those people were as good as dead anyway with the corpos screwing them over
[1:23:38] <Thorn14> I imagine there's a "Kill them all" ending too
[1:23:38] <+yuppie_water> this game has the ol' obsidian both choices kinda suck motif
[1:23:38] <Zalthia> There’s a third option?
[1:23:44] <arkv01> everytime I see pats face on that thing
[1:23:46] <%Fadedblank247> yeah middle roading quests pisses both factions off in this game lol
[1:23:47] <+xddddsorandom> THAT WAS A LITERAL FALLOUT NV OPTION
[1:23:47] <Edible_Enthusiasm> is there?
[1:23:48] <+shaderichter_belmont> @TaifuDragon did you check the sign in your ship after you made EVERYONE happy
[1:23:50] <+badjojokes> the EVERYONE WINS ending is still depressing
[1:23:51] <+Ablestron> @RushUnplugged I did that option and it actually makes everyone happy, and it requires only one person face punishment
[1:23:51] <%Run44forrest> whats third option
[1:23:52] <Zalthia> What’s the third option?
[1:23:52] <LilMKatsu> Let Pat find out guys NotLikeThis
[1:23:54] <%dekkitout> You're TOO cool PogChamp
[1:23:57] <+Diamond_Dynamo> The town can support everyone, even the deserters. The garden can't
[1:23:59] <Thorn14> I'm not spoiling the other options
[1:24:01] <Dakuu75> why are these loading screens just animal cross-sections lol
[1:24:01] <%InugamiTheHound> this quest reminds me of quest from new vegas
[1:24:05] <%Marpolo13> @Thorn14 hope so. i was gunning for it. if everyone sorta sucks, then get rid of em all
[1:24:08] <tigerfang86> The middle road fuckin SUCKS
[1:24:09] <MageSonic> LUL
[1:24:12] <tigerfang86> HARD
[1:24:17] <Edible_Enthusiasm> ):
[1:24:17] <gothas> I wonder what would happen if you killed everyone in town before shutting off the power
[1:24:17] <hntronium> BUT MIDDLE ROADING FUCKS BOTH UP its eh best
[1:24:18] <%Run44forrest> ok ok what if you give the power to edgewater but KILL REED
[1:24:18] <42nfl19> @AngriestPat Wait is there a middle road path?
[1:24:19] <+Ablestron> @AngriestPat it doesnt, I got that path and it worked out
[1:24:20] <Zalthia> Oh...
[1:24:20] <hntronium> THE BEST
[1:24:20] <%Marpolo13> basically PICK A SIDE COWARD
[1:24:22] <Edible_Enthusiasm> does the plant blow up?
[1:24:23] <Mushball> I am guessing the third option is save town tell boss to beat it
[1:24:25] <+shaderichter_belmont> middle road punishes you hard for being a Pinkerton coward
[1:24:26] <hntronium> FUCK BOTH OF THEM
[1:24:29] <RyanTheRecluse> Middle road works great
[1:24:29] <+Grayhammatter> pick a side coward
[1:24:30] <%lemuhollow> lemuhollow subscribed at Tier 1. They've subscribed for 17 months, currently on a 15 month streak! 
[1:24:30] <Siebersboy> I feel like a big message of this game is trying to be THERE IS NO WAY FOR EVERYONE TO BE HAPPY
[1:24:34] <sirrice77> wait whats the middle road?
[1:24:34] <Parapattern> Fuck you you tepid centrist coward
[1:24:35] <+digital_gambitt> You could have gotten the garden lady to be the leader of edgewater and solve the "plague" issue
[1:24:40] <Junkles> if you route power to edgewood you can convince reed to gtfo
[1:24:42] <Thorn14> Shh
[1:24:43] <%MalekDracarus> Not really I did it that way
[1:24:44] <+BoomerTiro> Honestly "Fuck you, you loser bitch" the game always tells you when you side with anyone for anything, or no one
[1:24:46] <%AgentOrangeShoes> The enthusiasm in this kid, fuck
[1:24:48] <+RoadRash13> kill everyone and leave the planet of dead losers
[1:24:49] <%dekkitout> Oh god, I read Thomas' last name as "Karth" NotLikeThis
[1:24:52] <sirrice77> i made the garden lady leader and restored the town and it worked fine
[1:24:53] <%Run44forrest> fuck you centrist LUL
[1:24:56] <Goldenwolf98> MLADY LUL

[1:25:03] <Dakuu75> Parvati, Havarti
[1:25:03] <RyanTheRecluse> Centrism is the true way
[1:25:09] <+Ablestron> its not a middle road you blame management for the towns problems cause thats where shit has been going wrong.
[1:25:14] <+Diamond_Dynamo> Reroute power to the town
[1:25:15] <Bobbledygook> @MalekDracarus have you checked the Edgewater sign that shows up in your ship afteerwards
[1:25:15] <+xddddsorandom> Enlightened centrist OMEGALUL
[1:25:19] <%King_Wolf_Rigger> @dekkitout KARTH!
[1:25:19] <Bouerd> Send power to edgewater
[1:25:19] <Thorn14> Had to give the town power
[1:25:20] <Gruhunchously> Guys a wants a bite of that cheese
[1:25:23] <@commanderclaw> Direct it to Edgewater and speech checks
[1:25:23] <+digital_gambitt> @AngriestPat Side with edgewater then option to oust reed.
[1:25:24] <Bouerd> Talk to Reed
[1:25:25] <+Lost_Zombie> @AngriestPat Opposite of what you just did
[1:25:27] <+Ablestron> @AngriestPat give power to edgewood, then talk to addleaid, then reed right after
[1:25:28] <Thorn14> @commanderclaw Got it
[1:25:28] <moonmeh> cut power to green house, oust reed
[1:25:32] <CoreyER567> send power to edgewater
[1:25:35] <sirrice77> after you restore power to town, talk to her and say you'll kick the current one out then talk to reed and convince him to leave
[1:25:36] <%TaifuDragon> @AngriestPat if you tell Reed she's able to grow plants and stop plague he'll step down for the good of the people
[1:25:39] <+Grayhammatter> guy wants a bite of the havarti
[1:25:39] <Thorn14> So YAY BAD END, I got this too
[1:25:42] <%MalekDracarus> Middle of the road path
[1:25:47] <Edible_Enthusiasm> ohhh, so the people would come back- but they would take over?
[1:25:53] <RyanTheRecluse> Reroute power to Edgewood, then talk smoothly
[1:25:55] <%TaifuDragon> yeap
[1:25:56] <MadDesperado13> Not really bad end
[1:25:58] <Thorn14> You get a cool propaganda poster about you fucking over Edgewater
[1:25:58] <tigerfang86> yeah that's the middle road though
[1:26:02] <hntronium> Can you kill her now too
[1:26:04] <%EmptyMug> I did load a save and can confirm you can get Adelaide to rule, but you have to kill Tobson but redirect power to edgwater
[1:26:07] <+shaderichter_belmont> i mean bad end is Edgewater existing
[1:26:08] <tigerfang86> you fuck over the growing community
[1:26:09] <Mushball> living past 40 is overrated here
[1:26:11] <+shaderichter_belmont> so this is best end
[1:26:14] <Siebersboy> edgewater needs to die
[1:26:16] <%Marpolo13> he didn't. he was a shitty worker
[1:26:22] <Dakuu75> dark
[1:26:23] <%Dr_Mooose> god damn
[1:26:25] <+Diamond_Dynamo> You don't have to kill Reed if your speech is decent
[1:26:25] <MadDesperado13> Edgewater is not a growing community lmao
[1:26:26] <tigerfang86> goddamn
[1:26:26] <+Lost_Zombie> @EmptyMug You don't have to kill him at all. He'll leave all on his own
[1:26:34] <sirrice77> so whats the middle road then because no one died
[1:26:34] <Forticon> @EmptyMug nope, you don't have to kill him. you can convince him to leave
[1:26:36] <tigerfang86> no I mean the deserters

[1:29:26] <RushUnplugged> SCIENCE FUCKING RULES
[1:29:33] <Dakuu75> @NecDW4 HAH, you're super right.
[1:29:33] <RushUnplugged> 20 Lockpick is awesome
[1:29:43] <Frog_of_Justic> Stealth as lockpicking is a bitch
[1:29:46] <Gruhunchously> @NecDW4 To be fair, the real Pat looks like a toy from the mid 80s as well.
[1:29:50] <tigerfang86> ^^
[1:29:51] <Edible_Enthusiasm> aww...
[1:29:51] <+Ablestron> @AngriestPat fair enough
[1:29:53] <transporterthesequel> Free yourself from this garbage pile
[1:29:54] <TDAWS_MP132> always time for another playthrough
[1:29:55] <star87if> does this game have third game perspective?
[1:30:00] <@lewdskeletor13> No
[1:30:01] <ScreamLord> @AngriestPat Dude is fucking weird how close you were able to make your guy look like you IRL
[1:30:06] <+Diamond_Dynamo> @AngriestPat Do you want to know what she tells you if you pick the town, then?
[1:30:07] <@lewdskeletor13> Only first person
[1:30:14] <$GoogleyGareth> Good call, whole point of the game is to commit to your decisions
[1:30:17] <star87if> darn it haha
[1:30:19] <Gruhunchously> Let's take a look at the damage
[1:30:23] <+Ablestron> @AngriestPat go rub it in reed's face!!!!!
[1:30:29] <CapCasual> @AngriestPat Did you know that you can respec at the ship if you need?
[1:30:35] <+Diamond_Dynamo> Fair enough. That's why I figured I'd ask
[1:30:36] <@commanderclaw> FYI this quest with Zoe is kinda buggy right now
[1:30:37] <%dekkitout> That plasma cutter looks rad
[1:30:38] <NaderShahDidNothingWrong> hell yeah lol
[1:30:38] <tigerfang86> yeah like
[1:30:40] <tigerfang86> that's fine
[1:30:40] <Goldenwolf98> wow LUL
[1:30:42] <transporterthesequel> DAMN
[1:30:42] <Bobbledygook> big woop
[1:30:43] <star87if> thnks for the reply ^^
[1:30:43] <Siebersboy> if you want to see the other outcomes try out the game yourself :)
[1:30:43] <%Valdorick> Wage Slaves
[1:30:46] <Gruhunchously> Fuggin yikes
[1:30:46] <%Dr_Mooose> ...
[1:30:48] <tigerfang86> that's fine.
[1:30:50] <MadDesperado13> Edgewater is already falling apart
[1:30:50] <KaliasTV> Saves them from the guillotine
[1:30:50] <RushUnplugged> you can respec at the ship for bits but ONLY skills, no stats
[1:30:52] <krymzen5> i think woste would be corp destroying the camp
[1:30:52] <bear_breaker20> and farmers families no?
[1:30:53] <Dakuu75> yeah, who cares. Corprate lives don't matter lol
[1:30:54] <+nekodelic> PAT'S RIGHT
[1:30:55] <+Estuko> FeelsBadMan
[1:30:55] <ScreamLord> @AngriestPat They're already dead inside
[1:30:55] <+metzselaar> Good on ya. We have our own runs. And less spoilers yall.
[1:30:55] <+rdark_ksu> well its not like they have any other jobs avaliable
[1:30:56] <%Marpolo13> that doesn't sound very sellout to me
[1:30:57] <Fujiwara_92> Hold the spoilers folks
[1:30:58] <dickbuttwoman> Their soul is dead (and weighted down with gravity)
[1:30:58] <wookie5358> pat making those tough decisions
[1:30:59] <Bobbledygook> GOD
[1:31:00] <Mushball> we are calling this a population correction
[1:31:01] <%GarbageNirvana> Can you really call this living?
[1:31:02] <Parapattern> That whole town was built to fail anyway
[1:31:02] <%AgentOrangeShoes> BILLIONS OF RESOURCES DEAD
[1:31:03] <sirrice77> yikes forever
[1:31:03] <%dekkitout> I mean sure, people died- but were they even people? SeriousSloth
[1:31:03] <Archmortal> I still vote for shooting Reed
[1:31:04] <+shaderichter_belmont> I mean everyone saying the colony is bad needs to remember that in Edgewater suicide is considered vandalism because you destroyed company property.
[1:31:05] <+Ablestron> "corporate lackies" you mean people with families who are literally at the bottum of the totem pole, with zero power over their lives
[1:31:07] <RyanTheRecluse> Well they aren’t lackeys, they’re people who were born here
[1:31:08] <@commanderclaw> Retail has damaged Pat's soul
[1:31:09] <%miguelrod777> people were gonna die anyway might as well be people you don't like
[1:31:09] <TyrantBelial> The corporate people were already illed on the inside.
[1:31:10] <WarchiefGoldva> @AngriestPat You still need to get the battery from their plants, don't you?
[1:31:10] <%AgentOrangeShoes> WORLD 100% A FUCK
[1:31:11] <zedravan> they are already dead inside
[1:31:12] <Bobbledygook> 410,757,864,530 dead wage slaves
[1:31:12] <+Diamond_Dynamo> Should probably see if Reed has anything to say, btw
[1:31:13] <Sauceboss15> I hate how this game makes me think of fucked up shit like that
[1:31:15] <@lewdskeletor13> She’s only gonna turn away the diehard loyalists, so basically no one who matters
[1:31:18] <NeroInfinite> niice
[1:31:18] <CursedNobleman> Whats consent of the governed? they dont know better so lets make decisions for em LUL
[1:31:20] <Zalthia> Elmo!
[1:31:22] <Gruhunchously> So the corp is bad because it destroys peoples lives, but those peoples lives weren't worth anything anyway so fuck 'em.
[1:31:23] <+spacehouse> They're bureaucrats Morty
[1:31:26] <%floralkami> LUL
[1:31:28] <Manjove> 410 billion dead Resources
[1:31:30] <Dakuu75> jesus, like a fucking EX Super! XD
[1:31:31] <saltyvest> You should see if you can kill Read anyway in case he's got sick drops
[1:31:34] <%King_Wolf_Rigger> Pretty much. That's why in Shadowrun, people like that are called Corps. cuz they work for a corp.
[1:31:35] <%AgentOrangeShoes> S L O M O
[1:31:36] <TyrantBelial> Forcing them to go non coroporate is fine, if they refise then they're basically brain washed.
[1:31:42] <+nekodelic> @ablestron that got a second chance as deserters and kept being loyal to the corp
[1:31:42] <tigerfang86> ^
[1:31:44] <$GoogleyGareth> I love slow mo much more than VATS.
[1:31:51] <CrabSlacks> Pat is brave to slaughter the working class so management is inconvenienced
[1:31:57] <%floralkami> S L O W T H E W O R L D
[1:32:01] <BlindGato> oof
[1:32:01] <%lastsonofodinn> lastsonofodinn subscribed at Tier 2. They've subscribed for 34 months, currently on a 34 month streak! 
[1:32:04] <Siebersboy> boot lickers in chat
[1:32:05] <Thorn14> Yeah I went with the hippies and I regret it
[1:32:06] <Dakuu75> @NecDW4 mmm-mmmmm... that's a bit much lol
[1:32:08] <+Diamond_Dynamo> I mean, I'm about as anti-corporate as you can be, but they're still people. They've just been brainwashed since birth
[1:32:08] <%Dr_Mooose> umm
[1:32:09] <KazMkII> Snipers in this game seem Busted

[1:32:37] <%King_Wolf_Rigger> I didn't even see what they said lol.
[1:32:39] <+Ablestron> did someone spoil something again?
[1:32:40] <Monkeyweed21> #Racewar
[1:32:41] <%Dr_Mooose> I guess that means the writing is good. I guess
[1:32:42] <sirrice77> Turns out Pat was Marx all along
[1:32:45] <%dekkitout> See what rampant capitalism does to us!
[1:32:45] <WarchiefGoldva> Videogames are fucking GREAT.
[1:32:45] <Siebersboy> good thing this game isint political
[1:32:48] <+Estuko> @Ablestron just going overboard trying to be funny lol
[1:32:49] <%MonsieurHedge> whats this about the race war
[1:32:49] <TyrantBelial> I will admit though. A bunch of Spacer's Choice problems is that they madet heir workers stupid
[1:32:49] <%AgentOrangeShoes> "World is a fuck" isn't obvious enough?
[1:32:49] <TheDiddlerz> Now that's a shitty gamer take
[1:32:50] <Zalthia> That means it’s good
[1:32:53] <$GoogleyGareth> @Thorn14 I got it on xbox one with the game pass, further than Pat rn.
[1:32:54] <%InugamiTheHound> a lot folks like hitler
[1:32:55] <Decsevm> this is why I am quiet, cause I am going to do my own thing
[1:32:59] <%TaifuDragon> Man as someone who hasn't had a completely-paying job ever, thee's something about this spacer's choice stuff that DOES tickle me juuuust a bit. Having a DEFINITE job waiting for you? eeeeeeeeh
[1:32:59] <ScreamLord> @AngriestPat Every conversation with these Edgewater fucks is like talking to a Telemarketer in stereo
[1:33:00] <%Marpolo13> all your friends are ded
[1:33:01] <Goldenwolf98> they are all dead bitch
[1:33:06] <Mushball> gruglyfe
[1:33:07] <Dakuu75> dude, why is EVERYONE so fucking HOT. this is unrealistic as fuck

[1:33:31] <%Svanyr> well that was easy
[1:33:32] <transporterthesequel> But like, really, Spacer's Choice literally murdered dozens of people for an insurance claim...sooo, who cares CANNIBALISIM
[1:33:35] <%Saltmeisterr> @AngriestPat how do u feel about the smaller, more contained areas?
[1:33:36] <RushUnplugged> I totally expected her to be a companion, she's JUST A RANDO lol, they look good
[1:33:40] <+rdark_ksu> the term is daggers
[1:33:42] <IncredibleMeh> She's totally nuts
[1:33:42] <CursedNobleman> @TaifuDragon cmonBruh
[1:33:51] <+Rodzzila> I wonder how many of this anti corporation folks are posting in a Iphon/Samsung Kappa
[1:33:54] <the_Punktuation> It's almost like a large ambiguous moral choice divides a large group of people
[1:33:58] <@lewdskeletor13> She’s a little out there
[1:34:00] <%dekkitout> @Estuko Wait- ... no wait I might like where this is going...
[1:34:06] <ScreamLord> @AngriestPat Every conversation with those Edgewater fucks is like talking to a Telemarketer in stereo
[1:34:08] <Siebersboy> yup
[1:34:08] <Bobbledygook> fuck Spacer's Choice
[1:34:08] <%Dr_Mooose> fuck the system
[1:34:11] <+neonNeptunian> Down with ALL COMPANIES
[1:34:12] <wookie5358> the developers are fine, but man screw those publishers
[1:34:12] <Parapattern> Exactly
[1:34:13] <tigerfang86> Spacers Choice did MASSIVE INSURANCE FRAUD
[1:34:17] <tigerfang86> WITH ROBOTS
[1:34:17] <Goldenwolf98> But they give me discounts Kappa
[1:34:23] <Zalthia> @rodzzila that’s like literally a meme. What you just said.
[1:34:29] <Siebersboy> It's not about which town to save it's about shutting down the factory
[1:34:34] <Gruhunchously> Pat is on his way to becoming Che Guevara.
[1:34:35] <%Piemen99> Spacers choice didnt give a shit about theses people
[1:34:35] <CursedNobleman> nice hat SeemsGood KILL HER FOR IT SwiftRage
[1:34:35] <@lewdskeletor13> But they give me a job tho!
[1:34:38] <flyingavocad0s> @angriestpat you're saving the company money
[1:34:39] <+nekodelic> @wookie5358 this is so accurate it hurts
[1:34:39] <plankk56> is there a level cap?
[1:34:41] <%Run44forrest> paaat
[1:34:42] <+shaderichter_belmont> I mean shut down enough factories and the corp will send some of their goons in so we get the satisfaction of killing some more corporate lackeys
[1:34:43] <dickbuttwoman> Check your rep
[1:34:44] <%Saltmeisterr> WOAH
[1:34:46] <Mushball> el pat
[1:34:46] <%Saltmeisterr> PAT
[1:34:46] <$GoogleyGareth> The thing the bothers me is how little verticality there is in the game. I'm so used to the "see that hill walk up it" mentality.
[1:34:47] <%Teh_Un> D:
[1:34:49] <+Pyr0_Fr0st> Just pretend they're Bell.
[1:34:50] <gothas> its about making a statement, MAAAAAAAAN
[1:34:50] <Monkeyweed21> can you recruit zoe
[1:34:52] <transporterthesequel> Can we talk about how this is engine actually fucking WORKS!?
[1:34:57] <ScreamLord> Capitalism as it should be implemented
[1:35:04] <KingSpunf> why are you wearing *** armour?
[1:35:06] <+bumpngrindhouse_> @AngriestPat Out of curiosity, what difficulty are you playing on man?
[1:35:07] <%miguelrod777> LUL
[1:35:08] <tigerfang86> LMAO
[1:35:08] <krymzen5> LUL
[1:35:08] <%Marpolo13> LUL
[1:35:09] <AMaidIndeed> What if I enjoy the taste of boot shine tho? :D
[1:35:10] <+Diamond_Dynamo> See, that's the thing about kicking Reed out of the town (which I did). Adelaide says she's gonna shut down the factory, so I'm like 75% sure I'm gonna hear that Spacer's Choice wiped the town off the map at some point in my playthrough
[1:35:11] <CursedNobleman> @Monkeyweed21 there are 6 companions, zoe aint one
[1:35:11] <%Run44forrest> LUL
[1:35:12] <$GoogleyGareth> juuuuust fine!
[1:35:16] <@lewdskeletor13> @bumpngrindhouse_ He’s on normal
[1:35:20] <Gruhunchously> It's Unreal 4. Sure as heck is more stable than the Creation engine.
[1:35:25] <%Marpolo13> LOL
[1:35:29] <eiightbiitt> are you playing this on gamepass?
[1:35:29] <Parapattern> *dusts hands off* That's the end of that chapter...
[1:35:35] <Siebersboy> Literally anything is more stable than the creation engine

[1:35:40] <Goldenwolf98> that woman has problems LUL
[1:35:40] <+bumpngrindhouse_> @lewdskeletor13 Thanks dude
[1:35:40] <RushUnplugged> you CAN get a second companion on the first map but only after completing the main quest
[1:35:47] <ovan20> @AngriestPat the perk to fast travel while being over the weight limit is super useful.
[1:35:52] <$GoogleyGareth> I've found normal to be an absolute cakewalk currently. Dunno if it's just because I got lucky with weapon drops though.
[1:36:08] <%King_Wolf_Rigger> @Siebersboy My mental health has something to say about that
[1:36:12] <+shaderichter_belmont> can you change your companions weapons?
[1:36:12] <transporterthesequel> Like, literally decades, DECADES of Bethesda bullshit of, "OH WE HAVE TO USE THE CREATION ENGINE" fucking murdered in like, what, 3, 4 years?
[1:36:14] <+Ablestron> @AngriestPat when I made Addelaid the town leader rep for deserters and the town went up, BUT the Board (aka corporate) went down. I guess because addelaid made the town pseudo independant? i dont know yet what the consequences are
[1:36:17] <tigerfang86> Wheeeeee
[1:36:19] <Goldenwolf98> yeah big fucked
[1:36:20] <$GoogleyGareth> You get soo much ammo it's ridiculous
[1:36:22] <tigerfang86> nothing wrong here!
[1:36:25] <@commanderclaw> It's fine
[1:36:27] <CursedNobleman> @GoogleyGareth hard is a decent challenge, then again im probably nediocre with a weak build
[1:36:31] <@lewdskeletor13> @googleygareth Normal is pretty easy, but tbf this isn’t the kind of game I play for difficulty
[1:36:31] <%Run44forrest> oh boy
[1:36:32] <SpaceGuntank> oh man they're going to hate you so much lol
[1:36:33] <+shaderichter_belmont> I hope there's a literal riot at the hq
[1:36:35] <%dekkitout> Town's not on fire- wack ResidentSleeper
[1:36:36] <%floralkami> All of this is basically what started the Civil War, except the colonists were indoctrinated beforehand
[1:36:37] <KaliasTV> Was that a cliff racer
[1:36:40] <deafmutelaughing> we did it pavarti! we saved the city!
[1:36:41] <gothas> looks fine to me
[1:36:42] <+Diamond_Dynamo> There were some fights right at the start that went rough for me, but it's gotten a lot easier, especially since I got off-planet
[1:36:52] <Siebersboy> King_Wolf_Rigger Listen I'm a fucking wreck and I manage to break down less than that engine does

[1:42:24] <Dakuu75> can't loot a corpse that's still walking around, though
[1:42:24] <dan_g_v> i love the energy of the soundtrack, really fits with the spirit of the town
[1:42:24] <+twohitgood> steal his clothes off him
[1:42:25] <%trips___> i murdered them all
[1:42:26] <+Whitegrave> when I did this part my intimidation wasn't that high so I killed reed

[1:42:34] <@commanderclaw> This soundtrack is fucking aces
[1:42:35] <saltyvest> SLAY THE READ
[1:42:37] <$i_am_therydon> Shoot the place up anyway since you cant burn it.
[1:42:41] <+neonNeptunian> dew it
[1:42:45] <%King_Wolf_Rigger> You should kill everyone in town just for the XP. It's what Spacer's Choice would do.
[1:42:46] <@lewdskeletor13> The soundtrack sets the mood so well
[1:42:50] <Zalthia> Man this quest resolution doesn’t feel good
[1:42:59] <+BoomerTiro> I have seen 12 wild endings to this now and I love them all
[1:43:12] <misha_kastrilevich> Are people able to play this game without the quest markers?

[1:43:20] <$GoogleyGareth> LUL
[1:43:25] <SchroedingersFerret> It's so weird playing a Fallout game without mindbending glitches.
[1:43:26] <figysmalls_> hi pat
[1:43:31] <deafmutelaughing> YAY!
[1:43:32] <+shaderichter_belmont> that's why you care?!?
[1:43:32] <+TheSaintJohn> this seems like one of those morally right choices that's gonna bite you in the butt later on
[1:43:33] <%Dr_Mooose> oh...yay
[1:43:36] <BinaryShuffle> yay!?
[1:43:41] <dan_g_v> oh money
[1:43:42] <%dekkitout> ...
[1:43:43] <%trips___> lol
[1:43:44] <Dakuu75> LOL
[1:43:45] <%King_Wolf_Rigger> @misha_kastrilevich The hardest difficulty removes all markers.

[1:43:52] <dickbuttwoman> And now you just roll off into the sunset
[1:43:53] <Gruhunchously> This doesn't seem like the morally right choice.
[1:43:56] <$GoogleyGareth> It's gonna be zombieland up in here
[1:43:56] <Bobbledygook> LUL
[1:43:57] <misha_kastrilevich> @King_Wolf_Rigger NICE!
[1:44:01] <Huntercd> Pat can you destroy Spacer's Choice? @AngriestPat
[1:44:02] <%ChaosVulpes> I love Pat's casual, "Oh, they're gonna eat you..." as he walks by. XD
[1:44:02] <+aspirationdeath> @dr_mooose yeaaah... morally right...
[1:44:02] <Parapattern> Go fucking hunting or something fuck
[1:44:07] <@lewdskeletor13> I made this choice too and I stand by it
[1:44:13] <+Diamond_Dynamo> "Any loss of productivity will be deducted from your pay"
[1:44:14] <tigerfang86> Seems pretty moral to me
[1:44:14] <NeroInfinite> Morals in this game is kinda grey
[1:44:16] <+twohitgood> it's fine
[1:44:16] <EuropanLamprey> This is all just repressed rage from Pat's customer service days isn't it?
[1:44:16] <SpaceGuntank> has he SEEN the town?
[1:44:20] <saltyvest> Kill Read you feckless shitgoblin
[1:44:20] <%GarbageNirvana> *eating the rich intensifies*
[1:44:22] <+OUTheTeam> so has this been good? i remember seeing gameplay and thinking it looked rough
[1:44:23] <eco419> LUL
[1:44:23] <dickbuttwoman> There is no morally right choice because the situation is already morally fucked
[1:44:24] <hntronium> The morally right choice is killing both sides
[1:44:25] <Siebersboy> in comparison to WHAT?
[1:44:26] <%King_Wolf_Rigger> @misha_kastrilevich But you should double check that. I'm 90% certain, but I can be wrong lol.
[1:44:27] <AGood_Noodle> I saw screw em
[1:44:27] <+Ablestron> Its definitely the most "fuck you" choice
[1:44:29] <+Nightmarecast> I made the opposite choice
[1:44:29] <@commanderclaw> All possible outcomes are imperfect
[1:44:30] <Monkeyweed21> You doomed an entire town
[1:44:30] <$zackalan> Does pat know how the other place grows it crops?
[1:44:30] <BinaryShuffle> bring out the guillotines!
[1:44:31] <camelwizard> Not helping massive corporations is always the right choice
[1:44:31] <Decsevm> I don't think you should look at this as right or wrong
[1:44:32] <%Dylveryn> They were all gonna die anyway
[1:44:32] <wookie5358> who can say. maybe the other way caused the world to end
[1:44:32] <%bread_assassin> You're see what happens in your next playthrough, let's say.
[1:44:33] <Axelbr> @angriestpat your monster
[1:44:33] <+neonNeptunian> ...yeah reed should get shot
[1:44:34] <transporterthesequel> Nah Spacer's Choice hold on that town needed to GO
[1:44:34] <%cylish> Jeffery dahlmers felt good about what he did to
[1:44:35] <+Diamond_Dynamo> There honestly really isn't a purely morally good choice here
[1:44:35] <+mgskomododragon> i wanna hear her talk more
[1:44:35] <Lady_M91> Sprats in the building respawn.
[1:44:43] <hntronium> Screw the capitalists and screw the communists
[1:44:43] <dickbuttwoman> You can fast travel
[1:44:44] <+Grayhammatter> the unreliable
[1:44:45] <Gorgen> jermaRat
[1:44:45] <%CalderGaming> there's no ethical resolution under space capitalism
[1:44:45] <42nfl19> But you did not technically "stick it" to the man...you just left a town to die.
[1:44:46] <+neonNeptunian> yeet the rich
[1:44:49] <WhitePantherZ> the hunting rifle is my favourite weapon so far
[1:44:52] <NeroInfinite> TIme to get on your ship and fuck on off out of here
[1:44:53] <ScreamLord> Unreliable
[1:44:53] <%axellogic> Seriously talk to the cemetery guy
[1:44:54] <+shaderichter_belmont> lets get off this hell planet
[1:44:55] <%Dr_Mooose> time to leave this shit hole
[1:44:55] <dagreenpillow> did he recruit Vicar Max?
[1:44:58] <%Run44forrest> wish there was a radio
[1:45:00] <Dakuu75> is he still encumbered ?
[1:45:01] <%King_Wolf_Rigger> Time to enjoy this fine weather.
[1:45:02] <ArtoriasTheTrenchfighter> Spacer's Choice is the Epitome of Built To Die
[1:45:03] <CursedNobleman> save edgewater Lawful Evil/Neutral; Save Dissidents Chaotic Something?
[1:45:04] <Goldenwolf98> Again best choice is terraform the planet Kappa
[1:45:06] <%Nomad_Scholar> the man with no soul enjoys spreading misery on thers
[1:45:07] <%Run44forrest> gotta walk there to take it all in
[1:45:10] <Bobbledygook> @AngriestPat you can recruit the vicar
[1:45:11] <+nekodelic> @42nfl19 and a place for them to go
[1:45:11] <transporterthesequel> Town was already dead, hell the reactor is barely functioning
[1:45:12] <NaderShahDidNothingWrong> No pay = revolution
[1:45:14] <wookie5358> I'm just sad we didn't get reeds hat

[1:45:17] <Decsevm> civil war
[1:45:21] <%axellogic> My one request is to speak to him
[1:45:21] <%Piemen99> Well they got a volcano right there
[1:45:22] <SpaceGuntank> i mean the dude was right he put all his faith in a total stranger and expected it to come out his way
[1:45:24] <transporterthesequel> Also Spacer's Choice literally already killed the town.
[1:45:24] <hntronium> I guess the company is going to get their insurance payoff sooner rather than later
[1:45:27] <Goldenwolf98> BIG MONKEY
[1:45:37] <transporterthesequel> The fact the reactor is still working is a miracle
[1:45:37] <deafmutelaughing> BEHIND YOU

[2:05:44] <tigerfang86> Parvati there are 3 people on board
[2:05:45] <ShoggothLord> @screamlord Because we used Roman names for our planets.
[2:05:46] <%Run44forrest> :)
[2:05:49] <Gruhunchously> @ScreamLord Because we decided to use Roman names for our Solar System, I guess.

[2:06:21] <Huntercd> What the fuck?
[2:06:23] <hlreiku> Is the outer worlds franchise material?
[2:06:26] <hlreiku> Sequels and all that?

[2:06:36] <Dakuu75> that sounds FUCKED
[2:06:37] <+Davos_Southway> hey Pat what do you think of the combat so far?
[2:06:37] <CursedNobleman> @hlreiku theyre planning for a OW2 i think
[2:06:38] <Gruhunchously> GOAT
[2:06:42] <%Dr_Mooose> goat exam
[2:06:47] <%Cthulos> so is this game good or is broke like a fallout
[2:06:52] <Fujiwara_92> So goat
[2:06:58] <@lewdskeletor13> It’s not broke
[2:07:01] <hlreiku> You know these AAA games and new IPs being risky bidness
[2:07:05] <Axelbr> @cthulos game very good
[2:07:06] <%King_Wolf_Rigger> @Cthulos It's good. No real bugs so far.
[2:07:10] <Goldenwolf98> Do it correctly or lose your social credits Kappa
[2:07:14] <%Cthulos> good!
[2:07:23] <CursedNobleman> i havent hit any bugs yet, which in my blackisle/troika/obsidian history is kinda a first

[2:07:35] <Parapattern> Shit man]
[2:07:35] <@lewdskeletor13> They worked him to death
[2:07:39] <tigerfang86> pieBleThump
[2:07:40] <wookie5358> it has npcs, and it doesn't cost 13 dollars a month to properly play, which is nice
[2:07:45] <%Dr_Mooose> oh god the feels
[2:07:47] <+Estuko> :(
[2:07:48] <FirewallStorm> this game feels like Fallout New Vegas but in space
[2:07:51] <Gruhunchously> This is one of the most stable looking AAA games I've seen all year, which is so bizarre considering it's Obsidian. It's some alternate reality shit.
[2:07:59] <%Cthulos> @goldenwolf98 take my social credit and I'm gonna be eating honey-roasted bear ass before the nights over
[2:08:03] <%XeroSigmaPrime> WHY IS THIS GAME SOOOOOOOOOOOOO FUCKIN GOOD

[2:08:42] <Goldenwolf98> @Cthulos sorry but many words in that sentence must be censored to be more Spacers Choice friendly Kappa
[2:08:43] <dagreenpillow> YAAAYYY
[2:08:46] <Axelbr> @gruhunchously it's actually a AA game.
[2:08:46] <tigerfang86> Parvati no
[2:08:47] <%Cthulos> it's a robot, go away
[2:08:47] <%Dr_Mooose> wtf pv
[2:08:54] <wookie5358> talk loud and slow so the foreign person undrerstands
[2:08:54] <@commanderclaw> Like your parents with Alexa

[2:09:02] <%floralkami> Pat, you called the ship dumb
[2:09:08] <NeroInfinite> Parvati is precious
[2:09:13] <Gruhunchously> This is such a Kaylee moment.
[2:09:16] <%Cthulos> cute
[2:09:21] <%floralkami> SHUT UP PAT, IT'S COOL
[2:09:23] <Monkeyweed21> CANNIBAL
[2:09:27] <NeroInfinite> That sounds amazing
[2:09:33] <corrosivePaladin> A cheese n plasma sandwich sounds good
[2:09:36] <TurtlesAndTentacles> Why doesnt Fallout look like this
[2:09:36] <Goldenwolf98> yeah that happens a lot
[2:09:37] <$GoogleyGareth> Ah fuck now I want a grilled cheese sandwich.
[2:09:39] <%Run44forrest> I hope the ship murders you in your sleep pat
[2:09:42] <%Cthulos> @gruhunchously did they literally say the grilled cheese line in Firefly???
[2:09:43] <+the_createy> that smug on her face when she jokes)
[2:09:44] <tigerfang86> you ever just climb a ladder and have a gun
[2:09:45] <SchroedingersFerret> Grilled Parvarti sandwhiches

[2:09:59] <%floralkami> @wookie5358 no, Pat literally called the ship dumb just before
[2:10:00] <Zalthia> Are there aliens in this game?
[2:10:02] <+NecDW4> Ohh, lookit Mr fancy pants with his toilet doors
[2:10:03] <transporterthesequel> That's how you GET SPRATS!
[2:10:05] <hlreiku> Thats how you get ants
[2:10:05] <Gorgen> LEAVE FOOD EVERYWHERE
[2:10:06] <@lewdskeletor13> You pull it out everytime you climb a ladder, I noticed that too
[2:10:06] <%King_Wolf_Rigger> That's, difficult. With an Oxy-A torch you can cook easily, but a plasma torch requires metal to ground off of.
[2:10:12] <NeroInfinite> Look at alll the room for your companions
[2:10:14] <deafmutelaughing> an infestation of sprats *while you're in space*?
[2:10:15] <%Movemeister> You want sprats? 'Cause that's how you get sprats.
[2:10:19] <%Run44forrest> do you want ants? beacuase thats how you get ants
[2:10:22] <+hopsytv> Sprats...Space...Rats?

[2:11:00] <%Emperor_Machinus> 0.
[2:11:05] <%Cthulos> yeah it is
[2:11:09] <@lewdskeletor13> His religion is literally just determinism
[2:11:12] <%floralkami> Man, that is jarring
[2:11:16] <Parapattern> Yeah
[2:11:17] <Gorgen> Ye.
[2:11:18] <Gruhunchously> The kitchen is just like the one on Serenity.
[2:11:24] <+Diamond_Dynamo> Fucking rude

[2:11:48] <arkv01> it is, you're just retrieving your belongings

[2:12:27] <arkv01> cant wait til he eats you meatbags
[2:12:28] <Goldenwolf98> he better say meatbags
[2:12:28] <%floralkami> @lewdskeletor13 it seems like he's looking for something more. These kind of guys either become new religion creators or martyrs.
[2:12:29] <+RSNoon> hello meatbags
[2:12:34] <Gruhunchously> Isn't HK just locked away in a room on the Ebon Hawk in KOTOR 2.
[2:12:36] <+Ablestron> ITS A CLEANER BOT WITH A MECHA BODY AND A MEGAMAN ARM CANON

[2:12:58] <+yasahiro1011> lets go one more time
[2:13:02] <Sokumotanaka> IT BETTER BE
[2:13:04] <%dekkitout> Groovy~
[2:13:12] <+Grayhammatter> i love the level up jingle Kreygasm
[2:13:15] <+yasahiro1011> Is Holographic Shroud
[2:13:20] <Goldenwolf98> @XzileGaming No doodStare
[2:13:22] <+yasahiro1011> just the skin thing from Tales from Borderlands
[2:13:38] <saltyvest> Ranged 40
[2:13:48] <deafmutelaughing> lockpick seems useful
[2:13:58] <Zalthia> Is Sam a roomba friend?
[2:14:01] <CursedNobleman> fallout game, always get lockpick LUL
[2:14:01] <%XzileGaming> oh yes.
[2:14:01] <zeif00> forgot how accurate the hair was

[2:14:12] <+yasahiro1011> pat's hair should just
[2:14:14] <%Run44forrest> no point in tech max can hack
[2:14:17] <%shattywack> God action figure Pat disturbs me
[2:14:21] <+Diamond_Dynamo> Man, there's a thing I'm really excited to have people to talk about, but we probably aren't going to get that far tonight
[2:14:25] <Dakuu75> why does the sight on that sniper rifle extend to the WHOLE length of the barrel?
[2:14:31] <+yasahiro1011> pats hair should just spike more the longer his stream goes
[2:14:46] <MsYakumo> Durability sure seems nice.
[2:14:54] <dickbuttwoman> Maintainance or fast travel while encumbered are probably best bang for your buck
[2:14:54] <Goldenwolf98> I mean things dont seem to break very fast in this game
[2:14:55] <Lady_M91> Durability seems good.
[2:14:58] <TDAWS_MP132> either that or carry weight seem nice.
[2:15:00] <Decsevm> give the biggest backpack ever
[2:15:01] <+GimmMeUhSammich> I did walk speed just because i want to GO FAST
[2:15:04] <Mushball> @Dakuu75 could be based off of 19th century optics
[2:15:09] <%King_Wolf_Rigger> @AngriestPat You can now repair stuff in your inventory
[2:15:13] <%Fenrirlives> save scum and see what's more instantly gratifying?

[2:16:12] <transporterthesequel> GET the Shrink Ray, at ALL COSTS
[2:16:20] <+yasahiro1011> A SHRINK RAY?
[2:16:22] <%Run44forrest> STEAL IT AND SHRINK REED
[2:16:26] <+yasahiro1011> Someone had a kink
[2:16:32] <transporterthesequel> No I have not played the game or know what it does. OBTAIN IT
[2:16:32] <Dakuu75> @Mushball huh, I'd never seen that before. I'm so use to more modern sights
[2:16:44] <ミュウレ4242> he just happened to spec right to get the most out of exotic tech.
[2:16:49] <%Run44forrest> SHRINK THE WORLD PAT
[2:16:51] <Mushball> best example is some of the springfield 1903's optics
