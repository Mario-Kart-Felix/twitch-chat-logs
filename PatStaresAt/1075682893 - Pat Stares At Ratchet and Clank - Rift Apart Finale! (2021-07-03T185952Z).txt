[0:37:24] <+SocialMisfitGamer> Faust is in dire need

[1:18:02] <sonofthedeepsouth> Yup
[1:18:05] <%Rain_Mage> yes
[1:18:07] <%JoshManVGH> But Ghosts of Tsushima next month!
[1:18:12] <%MelBrooksKA> I never played Gears
[1:18:13] <%RyTYoung> yeah
[1:18:14] <%coward_man> This is easily one of the best looking games going and it's fun as hell to boot
[1:18:14] <smugjorgen98> yes and loading time
[1:18:18] <%MosesUnspoken> It's so impressive
[1:18:21] <sonofthedeepsouth> Gears of War was a good game *sip
[1:18:24] <ThatGuyThere03> In terms of fidelity, it's up there
[1:18:25] <Dhrall> It really is amazing how good it looks, and runs
[1:18:28] <+MelodyMedley> Damn Pat
[1:18:31] <sonofthedeepsouth> Because they were Kappa
[1:18:32] <%Dakuu75> in terms of 3D graphical fidelity. yes.
[1:18:34] <+SocialMisfitGamer> This is the PS5 Flex game
[1:18:36] <@commanderclaw> IDK, did you play Metro Exodus? That was pretty
[1:18:37] <+RJay80> this game is gorgeous
[1:18:38] <tigeruppercut1226> Yeah, all I could think of when watching E3 this year was "wow, none of them look as good as Rift Apart of Intergrade."
[1:18:40] <%RyTYoung> Ghost of Tsushima is my pick still actually
[1:18:41] <%solracc25> This is MONEY game
[1:18:42] <ThatGuyThere03> really, what's most impressive is it's performance
[1:18:42] <%AgniBrandt> And all without crunch!
[1:18:43] <nuane> and it holds up framerate wise with all the particles
[1:18:44] <%coward_man> not only pretty but fun too
[1:18:46] <NickHatesSnow> Rachet and Clank games are always some of the best visually
[1:18:47] <%ABakedDemon> Gears of war is so nostalgic for me, played it so much through my teen years
[1:18:49] <sonofthedeepsouth> IDK about that one
[1:18:57] <brachydios777> This is what you get with no crunch
[1:19:10] <%TheYellowcouch> imagine bot Pat in 20 years and what he'll say then
[1:19:10] <ScreamLord> Same
[1:19:11] <%coward_man> like say the new expansion?
[1:19:14] <StarMechV> The Director's Cut is gonna come out for PS5. THAT'S YOUR BEST TIME
[1:19:15] <smugjorgen98> @sonofthedeepsouth put that monster down your heart is going to explode
[1:19:15] <+SocialMisfitGamer> Well.....DIRECTORS CUT
[1:19:15] <%RyTYoung> Well the director's cut is coming out next month which has 4K support
[1:19:17] <DSD24> Tsushima had a good ending too
[1:19:18] <Estuko> I still have the game magazine promoting Gears of War lol, looked like a horror game
[1:19:21] <%RyTYoung> and extra content
[1:19:21] <deathsmions1> this seems a lil busy at times
[1:19:22] <OldOnyx> Well, it will be years till most people can get a PS5 so....
[1:19:26] <dan_g_v> director cut?
[1:19:29] <ThatGuyThere03> Imagine every other company saying crunch is neccessary to make games that don't even look half this good
[1:19:29] <OldOnyx> only half joking
[1:19:29] <+MelodyMedley> I got 100% in Tsushima. Felt good
[1:19:30] <%JoshManVGH> And Woolie can get his Japanese lipflaps!
[1:19:33] <Sunstalker> Well, the directors cut is adding a new island
[1:19:33] <%solracc25> 3rd map is super pretty
[1:19:52] <%Noir_Valdr> so I'm stupid and didn't notice the "purchase multiple by holding" button
[1:19:57] <%OrangeMDT> I’d say it’s one of the best at maintaining high quality graphics
[1:20:04] <+DigitalSoulSpark> big same
[1:20:07] <%solracc25> the hot spring secret was the best
[1:20:10] <%Noir_Valdr> went through the whole game purchasing upgrades one by one
[1:20:11] <%RyTYoung> @melodymedley I'm trying to get it done before the director's cut to get that sweet sweet double platinum trophy Kreygasm
[1:20:13] <chimeraxmachina> Do we know how long development for this game took?
[1:20:14] <GigaSeifer> dont you also not like sprinkler?
[1:20:14] <+kullumanati> Forsaken is suppose to be the best looking game ever.
[1:20:14] <%Dakuu75> I think all of these games have that 1 gun we all hate
[1:20:15] <%cvp5127> why its a shotgun
[1:20:20] <+DigitalSoulSpark> Fuck shields, the best defense is a NEVERENDING OFFENSE
[1:20:22] <%MosesUnspoken> and it's the only one you need for the platinum trophy lol
[1:20:23] <StarMechV> buy the headhunter
[1:20:23] <%Shubreaker> HEADHUNTER

[1:24:10] <%sjay662> I like Scarlet Nexus's combat, but the story is actual nonsense
[1:24:11] <$KnightAsteran> @PatStaresAt Infinite health is also kind of a lie, you straight up dont get hit anymore so now hitstun or knockback at all
[1:24:15] <+cascadepersona> Added to the backlog
[1:24:19] <%MosesUnspoken> If my backlog wasn't such a mess, I'd already have picked it up.
[1:24:20] <+MelodyMedley> Scarlet Nexus does seem interesting
[1:24:26] <rosemon5001> it doesnt affect leveling you can have them on if you so wish @PatStaresAt
[1:24:26] <brachydios777> Big cheats
[1:24:28] <Profmcstevie> I think the anime of Scarlet Nexus is gonna drag that game through the gutter, it kills any attachment to ANYTHING

[1:24:59] <%octavian_wolf> oh for sure, the anime looks like traaaaaaaaaaaash
[1:25:02] <%SaiyanShoto> She’s gonna print pictures of her butt

[1:26:43] <StarMechV> They captured Bubbles to
[1:26:45] <$KnightAsteran> the Emperor did portal the ocean so maybe he sucked up the kraken with it
[1:26:56] <%Noir_Valdr> Bubbles came with Quantum
[1:27:02] <%Ziegsy> that was oddly dark choking
[1:27:03] <sonofthedeepsouth> LUL
[1:27:05] <+MelodyMedley> Weird drowning noises
[1:27:18] <brachydios777> @talokur29 That would have to mean Sony cares about Jak and Daxter
[1:27:19] <+nomos42> more of a reminder
[1:27:27] <%Noir_Valdr> you missed an offshoot
[1:27:32] <+black_pariah> did they really need the drowning sound

[1:29:09] <SaltyAzteca> Kappa yes
[1:29:11] <%octavian_wolf> YES PAT
[1:29:11] <TaloKur29> When the popularity for this series goes down then definitely they have to go with either Jak & Dexter or The other Playstation games that they make new of or bring an old one back into as a new one.
[1:29:16] <%CappuccinoGuil> But like... why?
[1:29:17] <sonofthedeepsouth> Be like Tywin. and kill your enemies when they are no longe4 expedient
[1:29:18] <%Ipsenscastle> eww

[1:30:02] <MrPandastic> @PatStaresAt Hey Pat, do you think the Monster Hunter team could teach Game Freak how to properly use their prior assets for future games?
[1:30:12] <+DigitalSoulSpark> Broooo...
[1:30:15] <TaloKur29> Just Spash them with Sulfur and they’ll go away
[1:30:21] <+RJay80> dude bros doodBro
[1:30:22] <+MarlooRedd> do eggs come in eggs?
[1:30:23] <%CappuccinoGuil> "Bro, your biceps are too huge, can I feel them? I love you, bro"
[1:30:25] <%Dia_Dar> hehe
[1:30:27] <+MightyDuckShoes> Jak and Ratchet crossover maybe? hmmm? The Furriverse of edgy PS2 mascots?
[1:30:37] <%CappuccinoGuil> Main issue is pokémon
[1:30:38] <%JoshManVGH> Goon-4-less are just a bunch off wholesome goofballs
[1:30:48] <%mike2hands> yeah pretty much
[1:30:51] <%CappuccinoGuil> Pokémon is too bloated
[1:30:52] <brachydios777> Even elephants hatch from eggs in Mon Hun
[1:30:54] <%sjay662> Pokemon is just feature creep now
[1:30:56] <zanzibarian_hamster> I like the humor of keeping amorphous blobs behind bars
[1:30:57] <%polothegreatest> pkm is stale

[1:31:11] <sonofthedeepsouth> REAL
[1:31:18] <%Ipsenscastle> I've been saying for years they need a slimmer reboot
[1:31:18] <+MightyDuckShoes> They chose a long time ago to be quantity over quality
[1:31:20] <KasiCrafter> Almost literally 1000 of them
[1:31:21] <Profmcstevie> Every new pokemon is a MULTI MEDIA launch, it's anime it's toys it's everything. The Games can't take their time
[1:31:33] <TurtlesAndTentacles> I like pokemon. Honestly even if they dont improve I will still buy. Pokemon is my Madden
[1:31:34] <$lumporr> i feel like the adults who are still really into pokemon are either into the competitive scene or need to let go of their childhoods
[1:31:34] <%SaiyanShoto> Pokémon legends at least looks like they are finally changing shit up
[1:31:40] <StarMechV> Quantom and Phantom are okay!
[1:31:40] <nuane> games that can pull off cartoon humor well are so good
[1:31:45] <%CappuccinoGuil> Bombardier seems to have a 1 shot maximum.

[1:40:28] <%JoshManVGH> "That was my favorite arm! It really pulled my torso together!"
[1:40:30] <+DigitalSoulSpark> Her robot arm is strong as FUCK

[2:01:23] <RickyRelucent> Manscaping all good, if you're really the guy to shave his shit go for it. But its almost a daily affair
[2:01:23] <+MelodyMedley> D:
[2:01:31] <RickyRelucent> and If you dont its a nightmare

[2:02:09] <chimeraxmachina> @bigfingerro that’s the spirit bro
[2:02:27] <brachydios777> 3d sonic games can suck it when compared to this
[2:02:35] <Ardailec> This level is long
[2:02:54] <BigFingerRo> @brachydios777 3d sonic games aren't even playing the same sport at this point
[2:03:09] <$apolitenoob> Is disgusting good or bad in this scenario?
[2:03:14] <$apolitenoob> I'm honestly not able to tell
[2:03:20] <NickHatesSnow> Honestly shocked those ice grenades aren't maxxed with how often you use em
[2:03:32] <%Dakuu75> seeing the stark contrast of pixels and high-rez 3D models together hurts my brain
[2:03:41] <rosemon5001> you can play around whit their pixel corpses
[2:03:49] <$LightningLynx89> SO MUCH!
[2:03:57] <NickHatesSnow> Almost lv10 too
[2:03:58] <chimeraxmachina> This is such a video game. The gamiest
[2:04:07] <StarMechV> The void repulser seems way mroe useful and fun with infinite ammo
[2:04:23] <BigFingerRo> @chimeraxmachina gamier than deer meat
[2:04:26] <RickyRelucent> Just saying, for me personally it'd either wax(Lol as if) or just some pubic or pit scaping. Cba shaving my chest or legs everyday.
[2:04:34] <+blademaster247> Does Pat have infinite health on also?
[2:04:37] <JittersCaffeine> They're robots, so probably a lot
[2:04:42] <StarMechV> no
[2:04:45] <StarMechV> only ammo
[2:04:46] <%Dakuu75> wtf? lol
[2:04:47] <RickyRelucent> It came up cuz some dude asked he get gets bellybutton lint
[2:04:50] <andrewofbob> Someone was wondering about belly fluff
[2:04:51] <%TheGreatSkenardo> Don't worry about that
[2:04:52] <chimeraxmachina> @bigfingerro mhm the delicious forbidden meat
[2:04:52] <Manwad> yeah
[2:04:53] <+MelodyMedley> It's a saturday
[2:04:54] <RickyRelucent> and another guy said shave ur bellybutton
[2:04:59] <RickyRelucent> and now we're here
[2:05:01] <$LightningLynx89> Waxed, Vaxed and ready for Summer Pat
[2:05:05] <brachydios777> One guy
[2:05:05] <%Ziegsy> @PatStaresAt I was wondering why guys got belly button lint
[2:05:22] <%Ziegsy> @RickyRelucent Im a gurl. So I had no idea
[2:05:27] <chimeraxmachina> Waxing? That’s what hair removal cream was invented for you savages
[2:05:30] <XeroSigmaPrime> Never ever had belly button lint before
[2:05:38] <brachydios777> Sorry, one gal
[2:05:45] <StarMechV> Death by a thousand cuts
[2:05:47] <RickyRelucent> Oh lol
[2:05:56] <%Ziegsy> danke
[2:06:00] <BigFingerRo> I kind of HAVE to shave my chest because I have a birthmark on the whole right side of my chest, and it grows hair much faster than the left side
[2:06:05] <andrewofbob> Rifts
[2:06:05] <StarMechV> rift
[2:06:10] <RiverBirch> What da dog doin?
[2:06:14] <SlangPunk> @ziegsy It’s the androgens, don’t recommend
[2:06:22] <RickyRelucent> Hair removal creams smells like death, and if i were to get rid of it i'd just get laser
[2:06:24] <bulletpunknetwrk> You should get Sponsored by Removal Cream kekw
[2:06:30] <BigFingerRo> other than that, a bit of a pube trim for aesthetics and ease of pants gymnastics is always a good idea
[2:06:34] <andrewofbob> Speedrunners use infinite health, the cowards
[2:06:45] <smugjorgen98> gotta cheat but not too much cheat
[2:06:55] <SaltyAzteca> SHE STARTS MONOLOGUING
[2:07:06] <%notsoy> a little bit of cheating, as a gift
[2:07:15] <RickyRelucent> i'm not that hairy of a guy, nor a girl. Got that scruffy cheek hair shit going on. Once found a single hair on my left shoulder
[2:07:16] <%athuramn> that last 50% of health went by much faster than the first oo
[2:07:20] <StarMechV> we kidna elft it at the start
[2:07:26] <chimeraxmachina> @rickyrelucent they truly do smell awful but the pain and possible complications of getting laser...idk if I’m down for all that
[2:07:26] <RickyRelucent> So i don't actually have problems with all this
[2:07:28] <+nomos42> NOW KISS
[2:07:36] <BigFingerRo> "Lemme take my own guy and leave"

[2:27:19] <Spudnacious_Dynasty> Upgrades?
[2:27:21] <StarMechV> you need to reach level 2 with the RYNO to upgrade it to it's coolest feature
[2:27:23] <%ABakedDemon> !watchtime
[2:27:27] <%Rain_Mage> Was that a fridge?
[2:27:29] <xhodocto385> @BigFingerRo which attack?
[2:27:30] <%ElkRiverDog> The Ryno, also the Fuck Around and Find Out Gun
[2:27:30] <+blademaster247> Big man needs big gun with big ammo capacity
[2:27:31] <%psidefx> The "Try to out do our optimization " gun
[2:27:35] <%ABakedDemon> !uptime

[2:27:40] <%Shubreaker> BOSS RUSH
[2:27:48] <TioXyco> oh no, not redemptiono arcs
[2:27:56] <BigFingerRo> @xhodocto385 at the final boss, it just throws whole buildings at you from underneath
[2:28:00] <%justcallmebobplease> Yes, it drops easter eggs, Pat.
[2:28:13] <%Ziegsy> right now its not too strong, but its got a huge aoe
[2:28:18] <+MelodyMedley> No drops huh
[2:28:18] <+zuzuxiv> holy shit
[2:28:23] <xhodocto385> imagine this weapon bringing out random humans from other universes LUL LUL
[2:28:24] <mephium> wait is there a damage cap for bosses?
[2:28:25] <$BlowFireThroatTotem> Why is pat confident in the framerate?
[2:28:26] <+snurtlord> does pat have infinite ammo on?
[2:28:30] <$BlowFireThroatTotem> Did he design this game?
[2:28:33] <mephium> it leveled already LUL
[2:28:43] <StarMechV> @justcallmebobplease you need to level it up and upgrade it first
[2:28:46] <%TheYellowcouch> wtf even is that gun?? I looked away
[2:28:48] <%athuramn> Holy crap all those effects
[2:28:52] <+ScrapKingKeita> I don't think they'll ever make a Ryno as good as the RYNO II tbh
[2:28:54] <xhodocto385> or better yet, imagine the RYNO summoning Kpop idols from another Earths Kappa
[2:29:07] <%Bane_Kaikyo> He also earned infinite health, but chooses not to use that
[2:29:08] <+Fenmore_> Y'know Pat the way you say you earned the infinite ammo makes me think you didn't earn it limesSmug
[2:29:09] <%Delenay> did you just drop raritaium out and you got it
[2:29:14] <NickHatesSnow> Almost lv3 already
[2:29:14] <vVAstrAVv> only suckers play without infinite ammo
[2:29:15] <TurtlesAndTentacles> Pat its trying things YOU HAVE SEEN BEFORE
[2:29:15] <MuffinMastr> @TheYellowcouch RYNO 8
[2:29:17] <StarMechV> @PatStaresAt When you upgrade it with raritanium it'll have a chance to drop something ELSE from the rifts
[2:29:18] <$BlowFireThroatTotem> It just threw a boat? This gun could kill Cthulu! macawOmg macawOmg rgtAnimeRules
[2:29:19] <%Shubreaker> SUS
[2:29:23] <%TheCallousKing> the things it drops are from different PlayStation titles
[2:29:27] <%ElkRiverDog> Awww, her name is Sue
[2:29:28] <%TheGreatSkenardo> ha it's called Sue
[2:29:29] <Ahk_90> Wait, this boss is called Scolo? LUL That's Italian for The Clap LUL
[2:29:31] <RiverBirch> 3.
[2:29:33] <andrewofbob> Each boss drops some raritarium on death
[2:29:37] <%TheGreatSkenardo> Desden Files reference
[2:29:38] <+MelodyMedley> Level 3 already
[2:29:49] <BinaryBetrayer> So it drops scalpers?
[2:29:51] <SlangPunk> @scrapkingkeita Probably not, but I’d enjoy the Ryno being a panic button weapon going forward
[2:29:52] <xhodocto385> sly must appear
[2:29:54] <%athuramn> skullgreymon D: ?
[2:30:06] <RiverBirch> halfway to 4
[2:30:10] <zanzibarian_hamster> It really says something that the Ryno in the first game would be a normal gun in this one
[2:30:15] <KasiCrafter> This RYNO is actually the Pixelizer with what it's doing to thestream's bitrate, lol
[2:30:15] <+SocialMisfitGamer> That was a Snagglebeast
[2:30:18] <%Dakuu75> oh, a snagglebeast lol
[2:30:18] <+emperri> talk about gorilla warfrare
[2:30:20] <xhodocto385> and this weapon is not causing the death of the spacetime continuum Kappa
[2:30:22] <rosemon5001> boss from the 2016 game @PatStaresAt
[2:30:27] <$KnightAsteran> @PatStaresAt its can drop Jak

[2:30:36] <$BlowFireThroatTotem> I'm good
[2:30:38] <@commanderclaw> Can't see shit captain
[2:30:39] <+blademaster247> Framerate is stronger than your bitrate
[2:30:41] <+MelodyMedley> Not really for me
[2:30:42] <%TheYellowcouch> this is awesome
[2:30:42] <+redthebaron> a bit

[2:43:53] <RickyRelucent> even the be right back screen dropping frames
[2:44:11] <%Ziegsy> @xhodocto385 but if you wash your hands, you wash off the flavour
[2:44:47] <RickyRelucent> As someone who went to chef/restaurant school i am appaled Ziegsy
[2:44:55] <$BlowFireThroatTotem> Someone should do a fan-art where it's Zangief in a pokemon battle, and all of his options are SLEEP
[2:45:02] <RickyRelucent> Whats next, cutting shit on wood? One cuttingboard?
[2:45:13] <xhodocto385> why is pat so small
[2:45:29] <RickyRelucent> Because he's wide
[2:45:32] <%Ziegsy> @RickyRelucent so am I, Im shocked they never told you!
[2:45:33] <RickyRelucent> he grew sideways
[2:45:42] <$BlowFireThroatTotem> He makes up for it with width, @xhodocto385
[2:46:12] <xhodocto385> KKona perfect
[2:46:17] <BigFingerRo> He was extruded from the front side, not the top side
[2:46:40] <BigFingerRo> someone just selected the wrong face, realized their mistake and went "Eh, that's fine"
[2:46:47] <chimeraxmachina> @xhodocto385 his skeleton is very shy unlike paiges, which constantly tries to escape her body
[2:46:54] <%The_Protagonist> The_Protagonist subscribed with Prime. They've subscribed for 8 months! this game absolutely shits on anyone's argument in favor of crunch. the fact that they put so much love and care into every little detail to make a basically flawless game with no crunch speaks volumes. suck it, crunch supporters.
[2:46:55] <xhodocto385> soon Rivet and Ratchet are gonna F the dimensions, not the emprah
[2:47:20] <brachydios777> Crunch is stupid
[2:47:31] <xhodocto385> crunch means time for patches, but no one wants patches?
[2:47:55] <RickyRelucent> @The_Protagonist its one thing buying the dlc cuz everybody does it and its whatever i want it, its another to shill for these companies and say its ok.
[2:48:04] <RickyRelucent> c :
[2:48:31] <RickyRelucent> Like most things in life, it gets down to toxic elitism.
[2:48:35] <xhodocto385> GTA 6 will come when i die Kappa maybe or maybe not, so no crunch
[2:48:54] <andrewofbob> @xhodocto385 If you manager your software project correctly, you save time not having to fix bugs
[2:49:08] <Wanhangidyilinya> biteyDed
[2:49:13] <Wanhangidyilinya> biteyOmg
[2:49:21] <brachydios777> We are supposed to go back to Vice City in GTA6, right?
[2:49:45] <andrewofbob> Nah, we go to Biggleswade
[2:49:50] <xhodocto385> and no one will talk about GTA6 until the end of PS5 Jebaited
[2:50:04] <+rbakervv> @xhodocto385 yeah, this game had NO crunch, and doesn't need any patches, funny how that works
[2:50:24] <BigFingerRo> The only person benefitting from crunch are asshole executives that make promises at other people's expense
[2:50:27] <RickyRelucent> short term gains is not worth your long term integrity
[2:50:39] <%shootbang_exe> well they have patched it a couple times for minor bugs and whatnot
[2:50:40] <%The_Protagonist> @xhodocto385 crunch historically causes more issues which causes a need for more patches, if you don't crunch people you don't NEED to patch your game multiple times after releasing a buggy mess
[2:50:43] <xhodocto385> ResidentSleeper 5 years for GTA6 ResidentSleeper and it's forgotten...
[2:51:22] <xhodocto385> peeing takes too long WutFace did he drank too much soda
[2:51:41] <%justcallmebobplease> It's almost like cultivating a knowledgeable team and not burning them out leads you to have devs that make better material, and games they make don't need as many patches.
[2:51:46] <brachydios777> It’s still wild that GTAV came out on ps3 and 360
[2:51:55] <%justcallmebobplease> Because it's not all made by FNGs that have not yet been squeezed for all their orange juice.
[2:52:01] <%The_Protagonist> @xhodocto385 he usually takes care of the pets and stuff on break. I usually take like a 10 minute break when I stream to make sure the pets are all squared away and whatnot.
[2:52:04] <thewrathofscience> he's getting wallbounced by Zangief
[2:52:28] <RickyRelucent> Prolly having words with Paige, on account of dog hair offense
[2:52:29] <+MightyDuckShoes> Zangief needs nerf
[2:52:31] <RickyRelucent> Oo
[2:52:34] <%mike2hands> is she ok?!!
[2:52:40] <%Broand> Water in the fire WHY
[2:52:44] <xhodocto385> yes but GTAV is being milked constantly on twitch, im tired of big streamers playing that every single day
[2:52:55] <RickyRelucent> good thing gief is not a stafford then
[2:53:01] <%The_Protagonist> @xhodocto385 so don't watch them?
[2:53:08] <Profmcstevie> Paige upper body strength MUST be increased
[2:53:08] <%Dakuu75> Paige needs a new spine. not a visit to the eye doctor
[2:53:25] <RickyRelucent> i can't stop but imagine Paige in some home alone backyard drag skit with Gief
[2:53:25] <+MelodyMedley> Fungi is here!

[3:36:50] <+Daywalker1592> all the money. hyperinflation to the max.
[3:36:56] <+fetrigon> you would die on impact
[3:36:56] <%coward_man> it would be solid like a pile of gravel
[3:36:57] <%Bailey__gaming> Zangief would eat the coins
[3:36:57] <%TheYellowcouch> but what if?
[3:36:58] <BigFingerRo> which wouldn't be too hard
[3:37:03] <+emperri> a handful of quarters
[3:37:04] <+D00msDayDan> pat's gonna make an ass out of you and me
[3:37:09] <%Bluwizard21> @PatStaresAt I have finally gotten a PS5. The first thing it did was insult me for pressing O to confirm instead of X
[3:37:13] <TioXyco> don't use poop money paige
[3:37:16] <+fetrigon> paige specifically would die on impact LUL
[3:37:16] <%Dakuu75> EVERYONE... send paige that clip of Peter Griffon jumping into the coin pool
[3:37:17] <xeros720> when they talk about "pooling money" that isn't what they mean
[3:37:24] <%Movemeister> That one Family Guy bit
[3:37:26] <RickyRelucent> paige jumping in such a pool would actually result in some bugs bunny esque sudden decelaration
[3:37:28] <%chiluzza> paige doesnt need pool money to abuse her skeleton
[3:37:32] <+emperri> neeeehhhhh
[3:37:45] <TioXyco> that was an opinion?
[3:37:53] <RickyRelucent> accodeon paige
[3:38:03] <%NopeBadguy> @PatStaresAt Did you ever get around to Fist of the North Star Lost Paradise
[3:38:03] <%Daxalog> worlds is Corp. Wilds is exploration
[3:38:04] <%GenX64> psaBougie
[3:38:08] <%xMaSterKeef420bluntNinjAx> Outer Worlds was... fine I guess
[3:38:11] <+fetrigon> outer worlds or outer wilds?
[3:38:12] <%Ziegsy> doki doki literature club on Thursday, yea?
[3:38:17] <%Ipsenscastle> Outer Worlds was a great game to play free on gamepass
[3:38:21] <%Daxalog> Outer Worlds is a corp name. Outer Wilds makes you think of exploration
[3:38:23] <Sunstalker> Shy said the second one was great
[3:38:26] <RickyRelucent> gesundheit mademoiselle
[3:38:27] <%NopeBadguy> Did Paige just sneeze
[3:38:32] <+emperri> was that a sneeze
[3:38:33] <+wizard_of_diamonds> LUL
[3:38:34] <+fetrigon> @ipsenscastle SeemsGood SeemsGood SeemsGood
[3:38:38] <%Dakuu75> lol
[3:38:40] <%JoshManVGH> can't Canadian money float cause it's plastic composit instead of fiber conposit? that might enable you to fill a pool with water and money and survive the dive.
[3:38:43] <+fetrigon> OMEGALUL
[3:38:49] <%Bailey__gaming> Paige activly Shopping at ACHME goods for Wile-E-Keyote style traps
[3:38:50] <susukouhai> LUL LUL LUL
[3:38:54] <$LightningLynx89> Dude why did you spoil!
[3:38:58] <$LightningLynx89> I wanted to go in blind!
[3:39:00] <%Ipsenscastle> "THE RING IS MINE"
[3:39:03] <rotundrareally> kind of crazy outer worlds already announced the sequel
[3:39:03] <%justcallmebobplease> Japan is wild like that.
[3:39:05] <Profmcstevie> Enix have no chill
[3:39:13] <Dhrall> I always skip Japanese trailers
[3:39:15] <RickyRelucent> She just keeps getting stuck in the beartraps she sets up for Pat
[3:39:15] <+fetrigon> cause there's no context
[3:39:19] <+MelodyMedley> Yeah...
[3:39:23] <RickyRelucent> and zangief's all like MEEP MEEP
[3:39:24] <%polothegreatest> japanese op and endings give 0 fcks
[3:39:25] <+ScrapKingKeita> HI TALES OF SERIES
[3:39:39] <%weissguard> TBF, party members are super obvious.
[3:39:41] <AllenDeadman> Tales as well
[3:39:45] <%weissguard> like every time
[3:39:46] <Profmcstevie> Oh please like the character designs weren't already giving it away
[3:39:47] <%coward_man> FF7 Remake and DMC5 had horrific spoilers in their final trailers
[3:39:48] <+Pyr0_Fr0st> Shadowbringers trailer
[3:40:00] <+DukeBlack_> I guess it doesn't matter since you wouldn't know the context
[3:40:02] <%NopeBadguy> Cat evil, especially if fat
[3:40:02] <+SocialMisfitGamer> I just started playing P4 Golden
[3:40:04] <%NopeBadguy> then fat cat evil
[3:40:05] <s1rcuit> sure does
[3:40:11] <+fetrigon> NO CRUNCH GOOD
[3:40:13] <vicious_rage> Asmongold FF14 stream is lit!
[3:40:19] <xeros720> yeah, frankly, it's mostly management
[3:40:22] <+ScrapKingKeita> From what I remember, apparently Ratchet and Clank 2 and 3 were under such bad crunch, the team basically screamed "NEVER AGAIN"
[3:40:28] <%monsieurfantastic> monsieurfantastic subscribed with Prime. They've subscribed for 8 months! Orb man!! Watched the omikron PT again and theres a part where a shopkeeper with a fucked up facial animation asks what they can do for you? You say "you can get the FUCK out of my FUCKING face you FUCKING FREAK" i literally laughed for hours. pet babies
[3:40:29] <%NopeBadguy> asmongold ResidentSleeper
[3:40:31] <xeros720> it's like you say, nothing wastes time like trying to save time
[3:40:35] <%Dakuu75> sounds true
[3:40:35] <+gksnipa> supergiant is anti crunch and see how their games come out
[3:40:37] <RickyRelucent> Well, there is ALWAYS crunch. They set a timelimit and you hold it to that
[3:40:41] <%Broand> My favourite is when they put unique cutscenes from later in the game in the opening of the game, for games where they only have unique cutscenes when people die, looking at you dangan ronpa 2
[3:40:44] <Explodincatz> do it once do it right
[3:40:46] <RickyRelucent> I just don't get the hevay crunch with almos tno devlopers
[3:40:50] <RickyRelucent> over like 2 3 months
[3:40:52] <%justcallmebobplease> It's almost like overworked people make more mistakes.
[3:40:52] <+black_pariah> tales of arise went hid all party members but three for all this time then dumped them all at once recently
[3:40:53] <%lemon_lore> not hiring new ppl all the time?
[3:40:57] <+D00msDayDan> Crunch happens because of bad management
[3:41:04] <mattdaddyd101> CRUNCH BARS ARE GOOD THOU
[3:41:07] <%coward_man> @RickyRelucent except THIS game was made with zero crunch
[3:41:08] <+fetrigon> you can't quantify invisible time costs. So why even bother fixing them. 4Head
[3:41:08] <BigFingerRo> "Nothing wastes time like trying to save time" You've said this before, and it applies here perfectly
[3:41:09] <%shootbang_exe> is this cyberpunk
[3:41:09] <TheFramedWarlock> @rickyrelucent There isn't crunch if you actually set a reasonable deadline and manage your time correctly
[3:41:19] <BinaryBetrayer> Cyberpunk
[3:41:19] <RickyRelucent> it shows
[3:41:28] <xeros720> it could be any bethesda title
[3:41:31] <%justcallmebobplease> I WONDER WHAT GAME PAT SPEAKS OF
[3:41:40] <RickyRelucent> @TheFramedWarlock this
[3:41:44] <%NopeBadguy> Sometimes the mistakes are people, and thsoe people are the managers
[3:41:57] <BigFingerRo> They can only be left in a "satisfactory state"
[3:42:07] <Profmcstevie> Man this unsaveable mistake sure was worth missing my kids birth haha
[3:42:08] <%polothegreatest> turn those mistakes into miracles
[3:42:11] <Daltonweakly> Cheer500 Hello Patthew, first time catching a livestream. Hope you’re well
[3:42:35] <Profmcstevie> if you go 1080p you'll live for long with that card
[3:42:49] <+MelodyMedley> tfw no GPU
[3:42:51] <xeros720> yeah, especially right now with the card shortages
[3:42:54] <dukenux> i would, but im broke :(
[3:42:58] <+emperri> upgrade before people find a new way to mulch graphics cards into bitcoin
[3:43:00] <+fetrigon> current situation is not going to get better NotLikeThis NotLikeThis NotLikeThis
[3:43:03] <RickyRelucent> Having tons of people to help goes a long way, big important director can't be arsed to do EVERY single detail right
[3:43:06] <+LionKagura> @Profmcstevie i have a gtx 1080 have never had a single graphical problem
[3:43:07] <%Dakuu75> Neat.
[3:43:12] <+Fenmore_> Play through characters at the same time, 2 chapters and then switch
[3:43:14] <RickyRelucent> Wrong time to be thinkign of huge developer staff tho
[3:43:16] <+LionKagura> @Profmcstevie since 2017 i wanna say
[3:43:20] <dukenux> its the worst fucking time for pc building
[3:43:29] <mattdaddyd101> BONS
[3:43:32] <+fetrigon> @patstaresat have you already finished it?
[3:43:34] <RickyRelucent> How long they work on r&c
[3:43:36] <BigFingerRo> I'm thinking of using my promocode WoolieVs for an artesian build, but I wanna build my pc to be lastingly beefy
[3:43:38] <RickyRelucent> few years?
[3:43:39] <+fetrigon> *scarlet nexus
[3:43:39] <Profmcstevie> Many moves means faster access to actual options
[3:43:49] <+Fenmore_> If you play through both characters at the same time you'll feel less of a spoiler feeling if you only beat one character and then play the other
[3:43:54] <+black_pariah> dont upgrade melee because most of your damage is from psychokinesis
[3:44:12] <BigFingerRo> HOW MUCH WOULD IT COST FOR A SOLO OMIKRON STREAM, PATTO?
[3:44:16] <Profmcstevie> "that matches my typical vernacular"
[3:44:21] <%Daxalog> Is Star Trek confirmed for later?
[3:44:32] <RickyRelucent> making dr nefarious basically lawrence
[3:44:41] <Explodincatz> Random Acts of Violence
[3:44:43] <dukenux> Always murder Oliver Swanick
[3:44:46] <+emperri> pat got clapped
