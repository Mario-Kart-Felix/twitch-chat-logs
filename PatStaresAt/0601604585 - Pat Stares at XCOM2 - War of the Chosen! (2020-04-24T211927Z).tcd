[0:01:38] <MSN04_Sazabi> Pat you need to use the Hybrid to fix the game Kappa
[0:01:41] <%Alopekis> It has sneks

[0:02:31] <%Animorphimagi> @tusk102 nice
[0:02:32] <MSN04_Sazabi> The game didn't hard crash his PC, he just didn't know how to fix it. It's not even a real softlock.
[0:02:44] <%Alopekis> You're not a real softlock
[0:02:47] <%prophetjo> hello everyone
[0:03:01] <%Jp3g95> Wow i havent seen you guys in years
[0:03:02] <+shry2049> @caffienatedjedi oh it's firaxis? damn that explains why civ crashed on me so much
[0:03:15] <+Jaysky> Our bodies are but softlocks of life
[0:03:16] <%King_Wolf_Rigger> @MSN04_Sazabi Man, if the game doesn't allow Windows commands to function properly, that's not good no matter what.
[0:03:22] <%Alopekis> You guys are just haters. The crash is a FEATURE.
[0:03:29] <%YakumoYomi> @Jp3g95 It's been 84 years!
[0:03:35] <+rei0> wait, war of the chosen?
[0:03:43] <nerdblase> Can it run in Linux?
[0:03:43] <%transporterthesequel> It’s Xcom’s murder difficulty

[0:04:02] <%Cavumentum> Honestly the game seems like it's just an attempt at a litmus test for people's reactions to potential changes they had in store for future XCOM stuff. Also WOTC?
[0:04:02] <+Suplexsenpai> We’re back
[0:04:03] <%Alopekis> It's to give you the real XCOM experience of getting fucked over by some dumb shit.

[0:04:04] <%코코꾸라> Wait, WOTC?
[0:04:05] <+Jaysky> @alopekis Correct. it's a failsafe for people who don't have a snake squad member
[0:04:08] <MSN04_Sazabi> @King_Wolf_Rigger Also there's 10 or so ways to close the game in this situation
[0:04:11] <KingKZ> A big give up has occurred.
[0:04:14] <tusk102> welum back
[0:04:15] <%Daskolin> @PatStaresAt Preopen Task manager and drug it in second window. Before starting the game
[0:04:15] <%ScreamLord> Did @PatStaresAt defeat the crash?
[0:04:19] <zuel122> minimize Task Manager in second window and set it to Options>"always on top" as a precaution

[0:16:17] <%transporterthesequel> The lost are great
[0:16:17] <%BallerSwagBro9k> WAR OF THE CHOSEN IS SICK
[0:16:20] <%hmgirlpopuri> Base XCOM2 is still good, but WotC is better
[0:16:23] <+GenesisKnight> There's a big XCom sell on steam
[0:16:24] <+Jaysky> What was Lost again?
[0:16:26] <custoadian> WotC adds the the best feature, the photo booth.
[0:16:28] <Redblood801> Did you get the mod that allows you to recruit aliens
[0:16:29] <MSN04_Sazabi> There's no point in XCOM2 without WotC
[0:16:32] <young_sn0w> Tfw this game runs like shit on console
[0:16:32] <tusk102> bad hair
[0:16:33] <SomeAsianDood> @jaysky zombos

[0:16:37] <%ScottishMadJacko> Can you post your mod list somewhere pat?
[0:16:38] <%pectusumbra> lost are zombies added with war of the chosen

[0:16:52] <%hmgirlpopuri> Chimera Squad is fucking dope by the way
[0:16:52] <%BallerSwagBro9k> So Chimera Squad borked hih?
[0:16:54] <+Suplexsenpai> Always underwater
[0:16:55] <+Jaysky> Ahh @someasiandood haven't played in a while
[0:16:58] <dmian07> How was XCOM Chimera Squad?
[0:17:02] <MSN04_Sazabi> Also the melee killchain mods for Lost are overpowered, Lost missions become fucking jokes
[0:17:04] <%Order_of_Mystery> @PatStaresAt when you have time, would you mind sharing what mods you have installed?
[0:17:05] <Mister_McDerp> my boy tygan
[0:17:11] <%GeneralSCPatton> I grinded so many levels off of endless Lost hordes. Everyone was fatigued as shit afterwards, but early Colonels.

[0:17:25] <%Jp3g95> It crsh
[0:17:26] <dmian07> oof
[0:17:28] <%QuadraticGravity> that was your controller. The crash not so much.
[0:17:30] <%hrudzie_1> so its perfect
[0:17:32] <yeetdabsenpai69> i haven't seen that yet
[0:17:32] <%hmgirlpopuri> Huh. I haven't seen anything like that playing it
[0:17:33] <Mister_McDerp> at least its $10
[0:17:33] <%fetrigon> DAS XCOM BABY
[0:17:37] <FalseEyeD> LUL
[0:17:39] <Redblood801> Plus, he didn't get the Snake Girl
[0:17:43] <%Valdorick> Pro-tip - buy it now when its 50% off, then wait until its fixed to play it
[0:17:43] <%lucaflowe> Seems about right for 10 bucks
[0:17:45] <+Merhabi> the game dun work
[0:17:50] <%Jp3g95> Pat had to restart his whole everything
[0:17:50] <%maenos2> big number

[0:17:51] <%CursedNobleman> GTS is correct
[0:17:52] <SomeAsianDood> FIRAXIS GAMES BABY
[0:17:54] <alphonseisbest> is xcom 2 worth picking up if on console?
[0:17:54] <%shocknawful> gorillaz
[0:17:54] <zuel122> GTS
[0:17:55] <QuestionableDes> School is the way to go
[0:17:55] <%MaddyCaddy> Ring gives you more resources
[0:17:55] <%manwithboxonhead> His PC almost caught on fire.
[0:17:57] <%BallerSwagBro9k> GTS ALWAYS
[0:17:58] <%Daskolin> GTS
[0:17:58] <tusk102> BIG NUMBER
[0:17:59] <MSN04_Sazabi> GTS then Ring
[0:17:59] <%GraceTBM> ring gives bonus rewards sooner
[0:17:59] <yeetdabsenpai69> get power relay Kappa
[0:18:00] <%hmgirlpopuri> Resistance ring first. Operations done in the ring cost time, GTS is only money
[0:18:01] <jbrowning134> How have the firaxis games gotten progressively more unstable? xcom 1 ran fine, but every new release is buggier
[0:18:04] <thatWaulfyguy> faces with that choice i play xcom one
[0:18:10] <%MaddyCaddy> Oh well

[0:18:22] <%King_Wolf_Rigger> @Valdorick Or don't buy at all. You know, like with Bethesda, why give money to companies that like to release games that are broken?

[0:18:31] <%Niney_Who> @PatStaresAt The Mod I meant was the "Lost World" Bug Fix, which was an Advent Negative-Event that put Lost on Every Mission, but it would glitch and make lost on All levels afterwards. But a 2017 Patch fixed it, so you're good

[0:19:36] <Mister_McDerp> this game is poison for Pat
[0:19:39] <%King_Wolf_Rigger> @Valdorick Although, I did buy Bannerlord so I probably shouldn't talk lol
[0:19:40] <%Order_of_Mystery> @alphonseisbest xcom 2 on consoles is good, but you don't get the ability to mod, and there's a lot of good mods out there
[0:19:45] <+Jaysky> @alphonseisbest I haven't but I imagine it runs fine, it's just that using a controller to play the game may be time consuming
[0:19:46] <%Niney_Who> It's not great
[0:19:52] <@commanderclaw> It's on fucking Unreal 3
[0:19:52] <%transporterthesequel> Chat don’t be crazy, we ALL PLAY THIS WAY
[0:19:53] <%GeneralSCPatton> Greatest Gun-Jumper in the world, psaBig Pat!
[0:19:54] <ChloeFleurage> xcom is not very optimized
[0:19:56] <%shocknawful> its a but chonkey
[0:19:56] <%Niney_Who> Paradox Games always chug
[0:19:59] <%Aeoneth> I disappeared for 20 minutes and Pat completes Chimera Squad?
[0:20:01] <+Merhabi> KIND OF?
[0:20:01] <jbrowning134> they run worse with every release. The first game was fine
[0:20:01] <%Niney_Who> er, Firaxis
[0:20:04] <tusk102> @PatStaresAt thats bc its xcom babey. also you have mods loaded
[0:20:07] <%Niney_Who> Civ 6 runs heavy too
[0:20:08] <%Ultimatefool> Xcom 2 runs like ass, it's true
[0:20:08] <%hmgirlpopuri> @PatStaresAt That was actually optimization tech in the first game. Start building shit to spend all of your money and if you needed some just cancel things.
[0:20:09] <%PanicSwytch> Maybe ur the problem Pat
[0:20:10] <%BallerSwagBro9k> LUL
[0:20:11] <%King_Wolf_Rigger> It has always run like shit, yet another reason I stopped playing cuz they never put in the effort to improve it.
[0:20:13] <%hzealot> what happened with chimera squad?
[0:20:13] <dmian07> Xcom is super slow sometimes
[0:20:15] <FalseEyeD> ...

[0:20:26] <jbrowning134> @hzealot it crashed
[0:20:27] <tusk102> @hzealot super big crash
[0:20:27] <%King_Wolf_Rigger> @hzealot It broke super bad
[0:20:27] <%Niney_Who> @PatStaresAt Firaxis games aren't optimized very well. civ 6 makes your computer go hot too. It's not that big of a deal
[0:20:28] <%Valdorick> I-its too big ///
[0:20:28] <ChloeFleurage> I'm fairly certain you could get a mod to fix all the piss-poor optimization and objects that don't need to be objects
[0:20:31] <%hzealot> i was there for the crash
[0:20:33] <jbrowning134> @hzealot its full of bugs
[0:20:35] <%NitronStreams> Clap
[0:20:37] <%hzealot> but i left while stream was off
[0:20:37] <%crimsonharvest> Unborkd the twitch machine yet?
[0:20:37] <%Daskolin> 2k games. No QA and 0 optimization(like i was instaling mods for optimization)
[0:20:45] <zuel122> what if it freezes again
[0:20:46] <@SoFarFetched> It's fine Pat.
[0:20:47] <%PanicSwytch> ANOTHER CRASH?

[0:21:00] <Mrbaconator> It's fine pat, i come here for you not the game
[0:21:01] <+Randomxdfun> Wait xcom runs like crap for you too?
[0:21:01] <%hmgirlpopuri> Hell OG x-com from 1994 has a frame rate tied to your processor speed

[0:21:27] <%NitronStreams> Its not running at 240 fps so why even bother
[0:21:29] <%King_Wolf_Rigger> Oh yeah, just like Bethesda you gotta rely on modders to make the games good.
[0:21:30] <%The_Butterfly_Man> why are you surprised
[0:21:31] <FalseEyeD> This is Pat Poison
[0:21:35] <dmian07> I'd also like to know about those performance mods
[0:21:36] <%Niney_Who> Thank you discord for your cool psionic knight dudes
[0:21:50] <%indig0bird> More like X-Con, AMIRITE?!

[0:21:59] <%GeneralSCPatton> @niney_who DisQord is best god
[0:22:02] <%Niney_Who> Yeah try to rush Mag-Weapons as soon as possible.
[0:22:02] <%hmgirlpopuri> This feels weird without Woolie talking about 'better humans'
[0:22:04] <fruit_pie_the_magician> This is XCOM for gods sake, it looks like a PS3 game and nine tenths of the time it's a still image, how do you even tell if it runs bad
[0:22:08] <+Rocket_Luffy> chimera squad crashed him
[0:22:09] <%Alopekis> I just looked up "performance" on the workshop and found a bunch of My Little Pony voice mods.
[0:22:16] <+GenesisKnight> Was that Jason?
[0:22:18] <%Cavumentum> One dude coming in with the fuckin hockey mask
[0:22:19] <alphonseisbest> ok imma be that guy is there anyway to mod snek people on to ur team in xcom2 chat?
[0:22:21] <%King_Wolf_Rigger> @PirateMike_ Chimera broke
[0:22:28] <dmian07> @PirateMike_ I asked about it. Apparently the game has issues and it crashed
[0:22:32] <%QuadraticGravity> @alphonseisbest ye
[0:22:36] <%Niney_Who> @alphonseisbest Kill the Viper King and make someone wear it, then they're a snake Kappa
[0:22:37] <PirateMike_> Oh ok
[0:22:37] <%ScreamLord> Was one of those Rookies Jason Vorheese?
[0:22:38] <%King_Wolf_Rigger> @alphonseisbest You know it bud
[0:22:39] <%Niney_Who> Yes
[0:22:44] <xxmagonx> Yes
[0:22:46] <tusk102> ye
[0:22:47] <i_am_therydon> sure
[0:22:48] <dmian07> yes
[0:22:49] <%MaddyCaddy> Depends on how much you save scum
[0:22:49] <OperatorPlease> yes or no
[0:22:49] <%Niney_Who> Get them up to their actual classes
[0:22:50] <PirateMike_> Yes
[0:22:50] <%spiritofmojave> Same setup ye
[0:22:53] <%Alopekis> Use them until they all die and then train new ones
[0:22:53] <%hmgirlpopuri> Push them until they're fatigued, then bring in new folks
[0:22:53] <%GraceTBM> 1 rookie per mission
[0:22:54] <%ArcanumMBD> Yes
[0:22:56] <%Zebroneath> Pretty much
[0:22:56] <dmian07> Or tired
[0:22:57] <%rabbi_hyman_krustofsky> No. Just replace everyone
[0:22:58] <%lotharrio> Make sure you have like... 3 squads of rookies ready to go.
[0:22:59] <%spiritofmojave> correct
[0:23:05] <CriticKitten> Depends, I usually run 1 rookie per mission to pad my squad
[0:23:05] <%Alopekis> Never use a rookie
[0:23:06] <%Laecerelius> Push Anime Hair Man for Summerslam!!
[0:23:07] <Jrocy247> What is this Avengers Bullshit
[0:23:08] <PirateMike_> Try to keep them all alive
[0:23:11] <%Zombrocom> Gotta create your elite doom squad
[0:23:11] <%Niney_Who> Darkest Dungeon Rules, get like 3-Squads essentially as you go on
[0:23:14] <%Niney_Who> A Squad, B Squad, C Squad
[0:23:19] <%Valdorick> ONE GUY
[0:23:19] <%BallerSwagBro9k> LUL
[0:23:20] <%Alopekis> Pat
[0:23:21] <%ArcanumMBD> When you up your squad to 5 or 6 then start bringing newbies to missions
[0:23:22] <%MaddyCaddy> It really depends man
[0:23:23] <%StaceMcGate> WRONG
[0:23:24] <+Merhabi> I say A
[0:23:24] <%Niney_Who> Well EVENTUALLY Yo ucan just pay for Rookies to get upgraded instantly
[0:23:24] <%thackattack00> lmfao
[0:23:24] <%ChrisPlaysThing> i like the rookie per mission rule
[0:23:25] <%rabbi_hyman_krustofsky> Yes
[0:23:28] <%Alopekis> You should really never listen to me
[0:23:29] <MSN04_Sazabi> You need your A-team now, rookies once you have 6-man squads
[0:23:30] <Mister_McDerp> use rookies early
[0:23:31] <%Niney_Who> But FOR NOW Rookiesa re fine
[0:23:31] <%GeneralSCPatton> Always be training rookies
[0:23:32] <OperatorPlease> pat, if you never use rookies, your squad will wipe and you'll have ONLY rookies
[0:23:32] <%StaceMcGate> one rookie is fine
[0:23:32] <custoadian> you want some promotions before the first haven mission, so keep them going for now
[0:23:34] <%galaxyswirl> psa1guy psa1guy psa1guy psa1guy psa1guy
[0:23:36] <%spiritofmojave> WROBG psa1guy
[0:23:36] <PirateMike_> Rookie per mission sounds good
[0:23:37] <%MaddyCaddy> If you save scum, fuck rookies, but if not, you need them.
[0:23:37] <dmian07> IS ok at the beggining once you can train them yeah. stop using rooies at that point
[0:23:38] <%Run44forrest> all rookie
[0:23:38] <Professor_Rakor> Just never take damage and do everything perfect.
[0:23:38] <%baronblank> one rookie per mission is usually good, you need to level them
[0:23:41] <%hmgirlpopuri> You want to build a good a-team and use resistance ops and GTS to train up your rookies
[0:23:42] <%Zombrocom> Put in rookies once you have a bigger team
[0:23:42] <Heyestus> Later on you can get upgrades that mean you only get squaddies and not rookies @PatStaresAt
[0:23:44] <Jrocy247> @PatStaresAt I have a suggestion. Play it your own way. :)
[0:23:45] <%GarbageNirvana> Simultaneously use all and none of them
[0:23:48] <%Order_of_Mystery> doesn't the guerrilla school make it to where your rookies go straight to their classes?
[0:23:49] <PirateMike_> Chimera made me miss Xcom 2 downloading it right now
[0:23:54] <%ScreamLord> That Heavy Gunner just looks like Kakashi
[0:23:55] <%lotharrio> Cycle in Rookies at a steady pace so if you get fucked and lose a squad you aren't fucked. Like how you were last time,
[0:23:56] <tusk102> @PatStaresAt if you never use rookies and you get squad wiped, you'll only have rookies. so one rookie is probs good
[0:23:58] <%Cavumentum> Just uninstall the game
[0:23:58] <CriticKitten> Just never take damage then you don't need rookies 4Head
[0:23:59] <+arfsm95> @PatStaresAt just delete the game
[0:23:59] <%Alopekis> I usually don't use any rookies until everyone else is dead.
[0:24:05] <%baronblank> but yea, later on you get the ability to start above rookie and then you never use rookies again
[0:24:07] <%Alopekis> Which is why I never win the game.
[0:24:10] <%King_Wolf_Rigger> Always have one rookie, never use a rookie, cycle them out, keep using them until fatigued before cycling lol.
[0:24:13] <zuel122> he'll probably end up with rookies due to injuries and exhaustion anyway
[0:24:14] <%Niney_Who> Remember not to leap through a Window
[0:24:15] <%MelBrooksKA> Sell all your Rookies for jetpacks
[0:24:16] <%Laecerelius> X-COM 2: WAR OF THE MIND GOBLINS
[0:24:16] <rubbishbinge> Get rookies with 10 years of experience
[0:24:20] <%de1ete_forever> run a TASbot always works

[0:24:53] <yeetdabsenpai69> RACIST
[0:24:54] <%Niney_Who> Not even the Freeman's Mind voice mod smh
[0:24:55] <%Laecerelius> Human DNA has made them stronger, and somehow even MORE naked than before
[0:24:55] <%Valdorick> They're "Unqiuely apperanced"
[0:24:57] <+OhioNitsud> Kill em all Pater
[0:25:00] <%michingmallecho> Kill them all. GENOCIDE HahaBall
[0:25:02] <%spiritofmojave> they didn't learn about pants on their own LUL
[0:25:08] <oldmanstu> what happened to Chimera Sqd???
[0:25:16] <%Alopekis> My game is basically Warhammer 40,000: XCOM with all the stupid mods I have.
[0:25:18] <oldmanstu> is it that bad?
[0:25:18] <%Laecerelius> Chimera crashed
[0:25:19] <%rabbi_hyman_krustofsky> Something tells me you are bad at Xcom. Maybe it's the rash decision making that pervades your usual gameplaying. It's definitely the rash decision making.
[0:25:19] <%King_Wolf_Rigger> Chimera broke bad
[0:25:19] <%Voidwyvern> Voidwyvern subscribed with Twitch Prime. They've subscribed for 20 months! Happy Belated Birthday Cube Man. Pet the baby and have a wonderful day. Thanks for many laughs.
[0:25:20] <dmian07> Voice packs are really good
[0:25:24] <BurdRightsActivist> I WANT TO FUCK THE SNAKE LADY
[0:25:25] <%pectusumbra> Chimera Squad hard crashed chat
[0:25:29] <%michingmallecho> Chimera is bugged
[0:25:31] <%spiritofmojave> Chimera was super buggy
[0:25:32] <oldmanstu> broke? crashed? ouch
[0:25:37] <%Binary_Fireball> @Alopekis you play mechanicus yet?
[0:25:37] <%shocknawful> Best mod is still the Carl from ATHF voice mod
[0:25:38] <derap41> Aww Ghees
[0:25:41] <Byronic_dreamer> @patstaresat is WofC worth getting?
[0:25:41] <yeetdabsenpai69> @BurdRightsActivist snek
[0:25:46] <%Zombrocom> Snake lady has nothing TO fuck
[0:25:58] <alphonseisbest> is there lewd snek mods???
[0:25:58] <BurdRightsActivist> @Zombrocom I'll find a way
[0:26:02] <yeetdabsenpai69> @Zombrocom she has a mouth
[0:26:02] <%michingmallecho> I bought it a week ago and the steam reviews made me refund
[0:26:03] <%King_Wolf_Rigger> Snek lady always has herself
[0:26:03] <%Alopekis> @Binary_Fireball Nope, but I've got it saved on my wishlist on Steam. Probably going to get it with my next paycheck.
[0:26:05] <%rabbi_hyman_krustofsky> AS a wise man once said: Go go, Power Rangers.
[0:26:17] <%BallerSwagBro9k> The CHosen are SO COOL
[0:26:19] <%WhereIsWill> yo @PatStaresAt you see all the ff14 5.3 goodies?
[0:26:19] <%Daskolin> WOTC is must have
[0:26:22] <$KnivesEve> what happened with chimera?
[0:26:26] <dmian07> Once you play WotC, vanilla is boring
[0:26:26] <%Binary_Fireball> it is exactly what you want out of it me thinks
[0:26:29] <%BallerSwagBro9k> BIG CRASH
[0:26:30] <Byronic_dreamer> well I'm sold
[0:26:31] <alphonseisbest> @KnivesEve broke
[0:26:33] <%hmgirlpopuri> Does Pat know about Line of Play?
[0:26:36] <CriticKitten> Aw man
[0:26:36] <akman14> Aww man.
[0:26:37] <$KnivesEve> ah
[0:26:37] <%Niney_Who> Don't overwatch her
[0:26:39] <%rabbi_hyman_krustofsky> Wizards of the Coast are hit and miss
[0:26:39] <tusk102> @KnivesEve giant crash
[0:26:41] <%rabbi_hyman_krustofsky> You liar
[0:26:45] <%michingmallecho> Chimera needs to be patched
[0:26:52] <%Niney_Who> Let her shoot from above since you get bonus accuracy
[0:26:54] <akman14> Awwman, a Hideo Kojima character
[0:26:59] <%rabbi_hyman_krustofsky> 4e DnD was trash dick
[0:27:06] <%Alopekis> Solid. Copy.
[0:27:17] <MSN04_Sazabi> Pat doesn't need to know about Line of Play, he's not even sure if half cover is better than no cover LUL
[0:27:26] <%Binary_Fireball> omg Overwatch is actually just an XCOM ripoff
[0:27:29] <%Zombrocom> I still kinda miss the Horror vibe Xcom 1 had
[0:27:31] <%Binary_Fireball> think about it
[0:27:36] <%Alopekis> Whoa. Hey guys. Welcome to EB games.
[0:27:52] <%Niney_Who> Why did Sectoids grow lips inbetween Xcom 2 and chimera
[0:27:55] <%rabbi_hyman_krustofsky> Fallout 2 > Xcom 1 > Xcom 2
[0:27:58] <ComptonRiot> yeah if the game can't calculate a grenade path it just teleports it
[0:28:00] <tusk102> @akman14 Awwman, a Death Stranding (Hideo Kojima productions TM) character
[0:28:00] <ComptonRiot> it's very awkward.
[0:28:04] <%BallerSwagBro9k> @PatStaresAt I made you, Woolie, and Paige in this game.
[0:28:06] <%Alopekis> @Niney_Who So they could kiss you.
[0:28:11] <+EyeFarted> YAYY LMAO
[0:28:23] <+GenesisKnight> that was so lucky
[0:28:25] <%Alopekis> Aye. Aye.
[0:28:32] <%Daskolin> @joey_jo_jo_juniorshabadoo 4e DND was efin math simulator. Like 20 min of combat in 3.5e = 3 damn hours in 4e JUST because MATH
[0:28:34] <%Alopekis> Is this guy secretly a robot? What's with that voice?
[0:28:36] <%Zombrocom> Man Templars are such weirdos I love them
[0:28:38] <%hmgirlpopuri> End of the turn yellow move into unexplored areas hahaha
[0:28:44] <%rabbi_hyman_krustofsky> @BallerSwagBro9k Uusally we don't brag about fanfic
[0:28:45] <%King_Wolf_Rigger> @joey_jo_jo_juniorshabadoo It really wasn't though. It introduced some cool new ideas, and finally let warrior classes not flounder at higher levels while also letting magic classes function nicely at low levels. It wasn't perfect, but it was pretty good.
[0:28:51] <PirateMike_> What is that voice Aye. Aye. lol
[0:29:00] <%Niney_Who> You could try hacking that tower
[0:29:02] <oldmanstu> Does anyone here remember Pat being a "good commander" in their very short lived X-Com 2 playthrough? Yeah, that was a thing ...
[0:29:04] <%Niney_Who> Instead of just overwaching
[0:29:12] <Heyestus> @PatStaresAt stuff that is damagingly on fire will have hazard symbols if you try to move through it.
[0:29:21] <%Niney_Who> I mean, you KNOW they're inside there
[0:29:32] <tusk102> @PatStaresAt hack the tower maybe?
[0:29:35] <%Alopekis> Just throw a bunch of grenades in there.
[0:29:39] <PirateMike_> Oh I hate this soundtrack with the whining ghosts
[0:29:45] <%Order_of_Mystery> wait, is it possible to complete an xcom 2 mission entirely in stealth without getting detected?
[0:29:46] <%King_Wolf_Rigger> @tusk102 Hack the planet
[0:29:46] <%Th3SmartAlec> DED
[0:29:47] <tusk102> FUCK

[0:29:54] <%President_Miyazaki> President_Miyazaki subscribed with Twitch Prime. They've subscribed for 26 months! When I first played Xcom 2 my only character to die the whole time was Woolie on a mission where Brennan was the reward soldier. This time through Woolie died again on the second mission. Woolie is an unlucky soldier.
[0:29:57] <tusk102> @King_Wolf_Rigger change da world. my final message
[0:30:02] <%rabbi_hyman_krustofsky> 4e almost killed DnD. That alone proves that I am right. You want quick skirmishes? Play Warhammer.
[0:30:03] <%Alopekis> Whoa
[0:30:04] <dmian07> Imagine being ambushed by a minigun
[0:30:04] <%Niney_Who> Pat she needs to move
[0:30:06] <akman14> This is fine
[0:30:07] <+GenesisKnight> She is on fire Pat
[0:30:08] <%DappercatEsquire> "this is fine"
[0:30:10] <%Dakuu75> "This is fine"
[0:30:12] <%Alopekis> She doesn't need to move
[0:30:12] <%Th3SmartAlec> Just a bit toasty
[0:30:14] <%Zombrocom> This Is Fine
[0:30:18] <thatWaulfyguy> LUL LUL LUL
[0:30:19] <%Alopekis> The fire makes her stronger
[0:30:22] <Onatamana> oh god, I was tabbed out. Did someone get blown up
[0:30:24] <%Daniel_Is_I> On fire, through a wall, still only 53%
[0:30:24] <+xpakeo> pats finnaly playing the REAL xcom game woolieF
[0:30:25] <%satans_finest_millennial> SAVE Martha
[0:30:27] <Psyramics> Snipers are just modern day Black mages
[0:30:29] <%Niney_Who> 100% aliens in the back-right of this building
[0:30:35] <corepercentlives> Cpt I'm on fire awaiting instructions
[0:30:40] <%afronooch> Are sniper still busted in WotC?
[0:30:43] <rubbishbinge> feeling the heat, eh?
[0:30:43] <tusk102> R-R-R-RIGHTEOUS STRIKE
[0:30:45] <%Alopekis> @Onatamana Nah. Some poor ADVENT fuck walked out of cover and got destroyed by a minigun.
[0:30:48] <%Niney_Who> Templars are SO GOOD
[0:30:49] <oldmanstu> The fire gives her +2 to Charred Flesh
[0:30:58] <%Daniel_Is_I> Oooh, Canto.
[0:30:59] <%BallerSwagBro9k> SCIONS ARE SO COOL
[0:31:02] <%XeroSigmaPrime> HOLY FUCK HE SLICED THE WALL
[0:31:03] <Broand> she's okay with things as they are happeniong currently
[0:31:10] <%Alopekis> Uh
[0:31:11] <tusk102> OVERWATCH WHILE ON FIRE
[0:31:11] <%Niney_Who> PAT
[0:31:13] <%ChrisPlaysThing> +1 to burnt skin
[0:31:17] <%shocknawful> Templar? I barely Knowar!
[0:31:20] <%Alopekis> +1 to ouchies
[0:31:24] <%the1truefaraldo> She fell through the roof lul
[0:31:28] <oldmanstu> 1%
[0:31:33] <+GenesisKnight> The building's on fire! Of course she fell!
[0:31:41] <MSN04_Sazabi> @PatStaresAt In future hack with the drone guy, they can get permament hack boosts from this
[0:31:45] <tusk102> @PatStaresAt why would you put her in overwatch on a burning building
[0:31:47] <+Davos_Southway> how bad has this run been so far?
[0:31:50] <%hmgirlpopuri> 'Either five guys stand up from behind the couch with guns, or you get $20'
[0:31:59] <%Niney_Who> EASILY PREVENTABLE Damage at that
[0:32:02] <%Alopekis> @tusk102 It's the last thing the enemy would expect.
[0:32:02] <%Laecerelius> time to restart the ENTIRE run!
[0:32:05] <zuel122> specialists can hack through line of sight and are better hackers. remember that for future objectives
[0:32:09] <%King_Wolf_Rigger> @joey_jo_jo_juniorshabadoo Not really. It was players who didn't really try to understand what was happening. It was also somewhat successful amongst newer players. And Warhammer Fantasy/Zweihander while insanely good, felt more oriented towards long-term investments and making you feel scared that your character may blow up lol.
[0:32:09] <+EvilSoully> Guessing this isnt nearly as bad as the youtube run
[0:32:11] <tusk102> @Alopekis you know what you're right
[0:32:25] <%Alopekis> Target. Still. Standing.
[0:32:25] <tusk102> target. still. standing
[0:32:28] <MSN04_Sazabi> @EvilSoully This is not on Commander either LUL
[0:32:29] <Luizabd> remenber when he had cloths?
[0:32:38] <tusk102> why the heck is that guys voice so awful
[0:32:40] <%Alopekis> What is that fucking voice, @PatStaresAt?
[0:32:41] <oldmanstu> I dunno, Evil, he just sat a soldier on Overwatch stood in fire ....
[0:32:44] <+MrAtheGreat> Okay, what’d I miss? Why’s Pat playing Xcom outta nowhere?
[0:32:49] <%Niney_Who> Get his ass
[0:32:53] <%King_Wolf_Rigger> @joey_jo_jo_juniorshabadoo Though have you tried Rifts? I try to push that game when I get the chance. It's so radical.
[0:32:53] <%pectusumbra> yeyeyeyeye
[0:32:54] <%GraceTBM> pat wouldn't enjoy commander
[0:32:56] <%bluefooddye1> yeye kill the muties, XCOM! XCOM!
[0:33:01] <%Daniel_Is_I> @MrAtheGreat It's a new game
[0:33:03] <%Alopekis> @MrAtheGreat XCOM stopped working so he decided to play XCOM instead.
[0:33:04] <dmian07> @MrAtheGreat Chimera squad crashed
[0:33:05] <%ScottishMadJacko> I swear templar are actually the strongest
[0:33:11] <tusk102> @MrAtheGreat he was gonna play the new Chimera Squad but it fucked up and crashed so hard he had to restart his pc.
[0:33:13] <%gespenst25> and my axe
[0:33:14] <Heyestus> boi kills so good he gets a promotion
[0:33:14] <Onatamana> @Davos_Southway I think the maximum amount of fucked this campaign can get is limited since squad members can't die without resetting the mission.
[0:33:15] <%maenos2> @MrAtheGreat chimera squad was buggy and crashed and froze his computer so he restarted, went "fuck this" and played this
[0:33:16] <+MrAtheGreat> @dmian07 RIP
[0:33:16] <%BallerSwagBro9k> TEMPLARS ARE SICK
[0:33:18] <%XeroSigmaPrime> Played XCOM loved it, nvr played 2 at all. Do I get Vanilla or with War of Chosen?
[0:33:29] <%Zombrocom> Templars are so OP it's great
[0:33:29] <+AtlasMcCoy> Get WotC
[0:33:30] <%Alopekis> @XeroSigmaPrime WOTC
[0:33:31] <%BallerSwagBro9k> @XeroSigmaPrime WOTC
[0:33:31] <%pectusumbra> good job!
[0:33:33] <%Shady_Squid> I want an Xcom game with EDF level voice acting.
[0:33:34] <%King_Wolf_Rigger> I like how the grenade goes through solid walls
[0:33:35] <+MrAtheGreat> @maenos2 damn, that sucks

[0:33:37] <%XeroSigmaPrime> TY guys
[0:33:37] <%Daskolin> @PatStaresAt Pat did you did INI optimization?
[0:33:39] <oldmanstu> Xero, i recommend X-Com 2 and then mod in Long War 2
[0:33:40] <@SoFarFetched> This doesn't look like Wizards of the Coast.
[0:33:40] <%rabbi_hyman_krustofsky> Rifts is fun. Also a big fan of GURPS, Numenera, Shadowrun and Paranoia
[0:33:42] <%lutefiiisk> EGGZELENT
[0:33:43] <MSN04_Sazabi> But what about the mission photos Pat???
[0:33:44] <%zestyArsenic> stop making me want to put another 90 hours into this game
[0:33:44] <%rabbi_hyman_krustofsky> One Ring was cool too
[0:33:47] <%ScottishMadJacko> WOTC is a straigth up upgrade from the base game
[0:33:47] <+xpakeo> both @XeroSigmaPrime you can get them both on fanatical for 28 dollars
[0:33:48] <+seclusivechain1> how are the xcom 2 expansions? i played base game when it came out but havent looked at the others
[0:33:52] <%Alopekis> Optimization is for losers
[0:33:52] <%rabbi_hyman_krustofsky> And 3 Rings
[0:33:52] <+Merhabi> if Pat is having trouble with Hitching, theres a guide on the steam forums for ini settings that fix a bunch of fucked up UE3 features and make the game run less crap
[0:33:53] <%Daskolin> @PatStaresAt ***
[0:33:53] <%Niney_Who> Fuck you Not-Huey
[0:34:00] <tusk102> @seclusivechain1 wotc is great
[0:34:05] <+AtlasMcCoy> Yo what the fuck why isnt your load screen 10 minutes long
[0:34:08] <+DingusMcFadden> Is this Pat's favorite game?
[0:34:09] <%reonome> did pat switch games lmao
[0:34:16] <MSN04_Sazabi> PARRY
[0:34:16] <%Niney_Who> Parry 100%
[0:34:19] <tusk102> @AtlasMcCoy thats pc
[0:34:21] <derap41> yees
[0:34:22] <%King_Wolf_Rigger> I unfortunately did not get to play One Ring. Mordheim however, hot dog.
[0:34:23] <%spiritofmojave> yes
[0:34:24] <custoadian> Parry is super the best
[0:34:24] <+Fnir> Yes
[0:34:24] <%Niney_Who> It's SO GOOD
[0:34:25] <%hmgirlpopuri> Parry hands down
[0:34:25] <%BallerSwagBro9k> YES IT IS
[0:34:26] <%MaddyCaddy> It's the best
[0:34:27] <%Cavumentum> Literally why choose anything else
[0:34:28] <%Alopekis> Parry sucks
[0:34:28] <%ScottishMadJacko> Parry 1000000%
[0:34:29] <%Zombrocom> WOTC is super worth, the other DLC is meh. The one that gives you mechs is neat though.
[0:34:30] <%Daskolin> Parry is super great
[0:34:30] <%BallerSwagBro9k> IT SICK
[0:34:31] <%spiritofmojave> yes to both
[0:34:33] <ComptonRiot> Parry's fucking amazing
[0:34:34] <matsukaze20> Parry all day
[0:34:39] <%ScottishMadJacko> It just deletes all damage from one attack
[0:34:40] <%CursedNobleman> normal or classic mode?
[0:34:42] <MSN04_Sazabi> Shredder
[0:34:42] <tusk102> @reonome chimera squad crashed so hard he had to reset his pc
[0:34:44] <dmian07> Shred
[0:34:44] <%Niney_Who> Shredder
[0:34:47] <+rei0> shredder, you need it
[0:34:50] <+EvilSoully> Shredd
[0:34:50] <%BallerSwagBro9k> PARRY + BLADESTORM = WIN
[0:34:50] <matsukaze20> Shredder
[0:34:50] <tusk102> sredder
[0:34:50] <%Order_of_Mystery> Shredder
[0:34:51] <xxmagonx> Shred
[0:34:53] <%Order_of_Mystery> armor is a fuck
[0:34:53] <%Alopekis> Shredder sucks
[0:34:55] <%hmgirlpopuri> I go shredder to help with early mechs
[0:34:56] <Heyestus> Armor reduction for normal attacks
[0:34:59] <Professor_Rakor> shred is pretty important
[0:35:05] <tusk102> @PatStaresAt shredders good for mechs
[0:35:07] <%Alopekis> Return Fire sucks
[0:35:08] <%hmgirlpopuri> Long Watch > Return Fire
[0:35:09] <%MaddyCaddy> No
[0:35:09] <zuel122> gunslinger path op
[0:35:10] <%rabbi_hyman_krustofsky> Also, 4e had poor sales so eat my balls
[0:35:10] <MSN04_Sazabi> Return fire is bad
[0:35:11] <%ScottishMadJacko> I agree
[0:35:11] <dmian07> I always make snipers
[0:35:11] <custoadian> I prefer long watch
[0:35:11] <%BallerSwagBro9k> nah
[0:35:12] <%Niney_Who> Long Watch is super good too, Depends if you want a Gunslinger or Sniepr
[0:35:15] <PirateMike_> LONG WATCH
[0:35:16] <drewslo> long shot is way better
[0:35:16] <tusk102> long watch
[0:35:18] <%SGrim> It's not great
[0:35:18] <Heyestus> you shouldn't be getting shot at dumb dumb
[0:35:19] <Professor_Rakor> sniper shouldn't be getting shot at
[0:35:20] <Mister_McDerp> long watch
[0:35:20] <ComptonRiot> I really like the sniper path, but gunslinger's great too
[0:35:20] <dmian07> Snipers should be out of fire range
[0:35:21] <%Alopekis> Oh wait
[0:35:21] <Ralfclogs> Lang Wetch
[0:35:22] <%BallerSwagBro9k> LW
[0:35:22] <%Ultimatefool> Using pistol as sniper LUL
[0:35:22] <+Vikingdeath1> hmmm, with only a pistol? thats not much damage
[0:35:22] <ChloeFleurage> Longwatch is way more useful on a sniper
[0:35:22] <+rei0> it depends on what you want with your sniper honestly
[0:35:23] <xxmagonx> Long Watch
[0:35:23] <TinSilver> long watch
[0:35:23] <+Merhabi> i think you will have more than one sniper
[0:35:23] <%Alopekis> Long Watch sucks
[0:35:23] <%zestyArsenic> Long watch + accuracy buffs, setup traps
[0:35:24] <%Valdorick> You going Pistol or Sniper?
[0:35:24] <%ScottishMadJacko> I personally preffer pistol build for snipers
[0:35:24] <%ChrisPlaysThing> unless you go pistol spec it's not great
[0:35:26] <%shocknawful> long watch is optimal
[0:35:27] <%Zombrocom> Gunslinger "Sniper" is so cool
[0:35:28] <%the1truefaraldo> sniper path is busted
[0:35:28] <tusk102> @PatStaresAt snipers shouldn't be getting shot at
[0:35:29] <%hmgirlpopuri> Return Fire means that they shot at your sniper, which means you already fucked up
[0:35:30] <TinSilver> best perk in the game
[0:35:30] <+MrAtheGreat> No
[0:35:31] <Mister_McDerp> imagine using pistol LUL
[0:35:31] <%King_Wolf_Rigger> @joey_jo_jo_juniorshabadoo I refuse lol.
[0:35:35] <MSN04_Sazabi> Return fire is like the only bad pistol ability
[0:35:41] <%Niney_Who> @PatStaresAt Well if you think about it, If you're gonna be a sniper, then you won't be getting targeted unless you're stumbo and get flanked
[0:35:44] <%spiritofmojave> long watch is hilariously good
[0:35:45] <tusk102> @PatStaresAt snipers should be so far back they don't get shot at generally
[0:35:47] <+MrAtheGreat> Turn fire uses a pistol. 1 damge per being attacked.
[0:35:49] <%Shady_Squid> Where da Snek women at
[0:35:55] <%Shadicara> Just don't get hit pat
[0:35:58] <%Niney_Who> We got Optimus Prime
[0:35:59] <%hmgirlpopuri> Snipers are so broken with the chosen's rifle
[0:36:01] <%Zombrocom> You either spec to be an actual sniper, or you go FULL PISTOL for fun
[0:36:03] <tusk102> @Shady_Squid game crashed so no snek
[0:36:05] <Mister_McDerp> WHY SKIP
[0:36:07] <%BallerSwagBro9k> EPIC VOICE GUY
[0:36:17] <%Niney_Who> DO NOT Do Blacksite yet
[0:36:18] <%Alopekis> @tusk102 There still might be snek but not on his team.
[0:36:24] <tusk102> @Alopekis perhaps
[0:36:24] <thatWaulfyguy> What's the strategy layer of this game you dislike? You seem pretty hype about everything
[0:36:25] <%Niney_Who> You need Mag Weapons and Advanced Armor at least. Also, Scientist
[0:36:25] <%rabbi_hyman_krustofsky> 2e is also best DnD
[0:36:26] <%Order_of_Mystery> I love the council guy's voice
[0:36:27] <%StaceMcGate> Scientist
[0:36:27] <%hmgirlpopuri> @Zombrocom Pistolier with bluescreen rounds is just mwah
[0:36:27] <%Alopekis> Do Blacksite immediately
[0:36:28] <%Zombrocom> Gunslingers are so busted vs lost. Can literally wipe out hordes by themselves
[0:36:30] <matsukaze20> Scientist
[0:36:31] <%ScreamLord> Don't disappoint Optimus Prime @PatStaresAt
[0:36:31] <%MaddyCaddy> Scientist
[0:36:32] <%Cavumentum> Scientist
[0:36:32] <%grandark_z317> JOHN
[0:36:33] <%zestyArsenic> Scientist
[0:36:33] <Mister_McDerp> scientist
[0:36:33] <dmian07> Scientist
[0:36:34] <%lutefiiisk> Story is shit pandering. Not interesting
[0:36:35] <+xpakeo> anyone remember the SBFP xcom 2 ironman LP, continues to be one of my favs lol
[0:36:35] <+Solutha> TECH UP
[0:36:36] <+Merhabi> Scientist good
[0:36:36] <%aishman> Scientist for now
[0:36:38] <%aishman> TECH GOOD
[0:36:40] <%Niney_Who> Scientist. Getting a fuckton of scientists makes you research so fast
[0:36:40] <%Order_of_Mystery> save the nerd!
[0:36:44] <i_am_therydon> i say supplies but thats me
[0:36:45] <%Th3SmartAlec> Do it. For science
[0:36:46] <Heyestus> money is temporary, Science is forever!
[0:36:47] <%aishman> SUPPLIeS NOT AS GOOD
[0:36:47] <Mister_McDerp> tech is god
[0:36:48] <%BallerSwagBro9k> JON BAILEY IS SO GOOD AS COUNCIL
[0:36:59] <%Bailey__gaming> hey I fell asleep did I miss snek?
[0:37:01] <%Bane_Kaikyo> Scientist will eventually lead the world down the path of snake tiddy.... so science gud
[0:37:03] <+MrAtheGreat> *shurgs*
[0:37:06] <%Niney_Who> That's for the stupid Hunter Weapons
[0:37:07] <%MaddyCaddy> You need it
[0:37:11] <MSN04_Sazabi> They're great
[0:37:12] <%satans_finest_millennial> Tygan of the yukon
[0:37:13] <%pectusumbra> it's inspiration do it
[0:37:13] <%Alopekis> @Bailey__gaming No, game crashed so he's playing XCOM 2 instead.
[0:37:15] <%Niney_Who> @PatStaresAt The AXE From the Hunter Weapons is super good though
[0:37:21] <%hmgirlpopuri> Cryo Grenade is pretty good too
[0:37:22] <%Daskolin> @PatStaresAt Thing is Xcom optimized badly and not allocate video memory right. So you need to do it manually in INI(it was using only 256m of my 1080 back in a day)
[0:37:30] <CruxAustralis> oh this is going to go swimmingly
[0:37:32] <%Th3SmartAlec> Innie or outie?
[0:37:33] <silverira> I kid not commander he transformed himself into a pickle funniest shit I've ever seen
[0:37:33] <%Shadicara> I've never played Xcom so this is a nice surprise
[0:37:33] <%BallerSwagBro9k> sure
[0:37:37] <%rabbi_hyman_krustofsky> No
[0:37:39] <MSN04_Sazabi> Crossbow, Axe and Pistol are good. Frost nade is overpowered
[0:37:40] <%Alopekis> Get the Pat voice mod
[0:37:42] <%Bailey__gaming> hey Pat :-)
[0:37:42] <%Th3SmartAlec> LUL
[0:37:43] <%Niney_Who> @PatStaresAt If you get the Hunter Weapons researched, just do that easy-to-do bug where you get both an Axe and Sword on a Ranger.
[0:37:52] <%spiritofmojave> Outtie file
[0:37:53] <+silvery_cricket> Mods? Okay what flavor of anime girl do you want?
[0:37:54] <%Ultimatefool> Are you an INI or an outty
[0:37:56] <%WhereIsWill> get the remerai pat in xcom??
[0:37:56] <+xpakeo> do you plan on playing more XCOM after today? @PatStaresAt
[0:37:56] <%King_Wolf_Rigger> @joey_jo_jo_juniorshabadoo I started in AD&D, just before 2nd ed came out. I gotta say, the THAC0, while funny, isn't great. But the theming of the system was awesome. I feel like the focus on skill points in future systems kinda took away from it.
[0:38:00] <+Merhabi> Sidey file
[0:38:03] <dmian07> There's a guy called ChristopherOdd on YT he has a list of MODs he uses. basically all of those
[0:38:03] <tusk102> god this guys voice
[0:38:04] <%Niney_Who> REAPERS
[0:38:07] <Redblood801> Councilman guy sounds like he has a cold
[0:38:07] <MSN04_Sazabi> REAPERS
[0:38:12] <%Niney_Who> Reapers are SO STRONG
[0:38:12] <%Mornaka> is that the movie trailers voice guy?
[0:38:14] <%spiritofmojave> REAPERS
[0:38:14] <%A_DEAD_SHOW> Is that literally the guy from honest trailers?
[0:38:18] <%nofestu2> dude sounds like he has a cold
[0:38:18] <Mister_McDerp> Kreygasm that voice
[0:38:19] <%Alopekis> Reapers suck
[0:38:22] <MSN04_Sazabi> Oh wait he doesn't have a sarge
[0:38:23] <%NitronStreams> was that the honest trailers guy?
[0:38:31] <dmian07> @A_DEAD_SHOW It is him
[0:38:31] <%Alopekis> @NitronStreams Yes
[0:38:32] <%Shady_Squid> CoMmAnDeR
[0:38:33] <%spiritofmojave> @nitronstreams yes
[0:38:34] <somekindofsam> doodDah doodDah doodDah doodDah
[0:38:36] <+Randomxdfun> Yo is that John Delancie?
[0:38:39] <%King_Wolf_Rigger> You know, I hate to say it, but if the game requires you to go into the INI files to make it run, it's not good.
[0:38:43] <%Niney_Who> @Alopekis You've never used the Unload move with 6+ Bullets in the gun on the spine of a King Alien and instantly killed it
[0:38:48] <tusk102> @Alopekis are you trying to one guy? you say "it sucks" whenever chat says it's good
[0:38:51] <MSN04_Sazabi> Council guy is the guy from Honest Trailers, Jon Bailey
[0:38:56] <%Shadicara> This is a funky looking game
[0:38:59] <%Alopekis> @tusk102 Chat sucks
[0:39:14] <%Laecerelius> science and shotties!
[0:39:16] <tusk102> psa1guy
[0:39:22] <tusk102> oop
[0:39:25] <%Alopekis> I'm just intentionally trying to destroy Pat's game
[0:39:31] <%King_Wolf_Rigger> Jon Bailey is radical
[0:39:31] <+rareqq> is this ironmode?
[0:39:32] <+scrumbotime> Wait, are the different factions in here just precursors to the enemy ones in Chimera Squad? Bad Hybrids, Bad Psychics, and Bad Techwarriors?
[0:39:36] <%Shadicara> LUL

[0:39:48] <OperatorPlease> ban this man
[0:39:48] <%rabbi_hyman_krustofsky> I started with AD&D as well. THAC0 definitely wasn't great. But Planescape, Dark Sun, Ravenloft, Greyhawk, Birthright and Spelljammer more than made up for everything the subsequent generations did better with their systems. The imagination was barre none.

[0:40:06] <%Alopekis> I don't appreciate false accusations, Pat.
[0:40:07] <tusk102> are those just ghouls from fallout 4
[0:40:08] <%ShichiNoBushi> Oh no! Zambos!
[0:40:12] <%AEUG_Ace_Kamille> BAN THIS ONE GUY
[0:40:12] <%rabbi_hyman_krustofsky> 100% imagination beats rules lawyer
[0:40:13] <%A_DEAD_SHOW> At least he's honest
[0:40:20] <Griffin1171> Remember, all deaths are preventable
[0:40:25] <%kekkerscrew> When'd xcom start?
[0:40:25] <bigstupidjellyfish1337> pat can ruin the game all on his own
[0:40:26] <CosmicApe13> How do you deal with the lost?
[0:40:26] <%R3Roundabout> He's honestly an asshole
[0:40:27] <%Alopekis> No deaths are preventable
[0:40:28] <%bevyrage> pat can't have chat destroy his game if he destroys it first
[0:40:30] <dmian07> I always get lucky with the one shot the Lost
[0:40:38] <%Jaxnos> uh oh this mission
[0:40:39] <%Niney_Who> Just sprint there it's not like Lost are even a threat until later
[0:40:41] <+FlareTitan> oh hey xcom 2 instead of chimera squad
[0:40:43] <%Daniel_Is_I> Some deaths are preventable.
[0:40:48] <%Alopekis> @bevyrage I'm just here to assist him with that.
[0:40:49] <+FlareTitan> how's it goin?
[0:40:53] <%aishman> @PatStaresAt Remember that shitty 60s Xcom game because they thought the original wouldn't sell again? BOY WERE THEY WRONG
[0:40:59] <%King_Wolf_Rigger> @joey_jo_jo_juniorshabadoo I miss those worlds. Spelljammer was fuckin wicked cool.

[0:43:39] <%DappercatEsquire> Sitcoms gave meatloaf a bad rep, meatloaf is fuckin radical
[0:43:42] <+randomarsehole> Raw meat is more natural
[0:43:46] <%the1truefaraldo> oof
[0:43:47] <%Jaxnos> nice
[0:43:48] <%uhdinocat> Boil the meat
[0:43:51] <fairore> pat
[0:43:52] <@SoFarFetched> It's still weird to think about the name "meatloaf"
[0:43:53] <%Alopekis> Raw meat exists in nature. Cooked meat doesn't.
[0:43:53] <ChloeFleurage> that voice is the best
[0:43:54] <tusk102> target. still. standing
[0:43:54] <rubbishbinge> Just have a tender birthday cake steak
[0:43:58] <%kekkerscrew> Meatloaf is Frikkin Amazing
[0:43:59] <%King_Wolf_Rigger> I think I prefer the LMG of the first game over the minigun of this one.
[0:44:00] <%Chester_goes_Berserk> ahhh that xcom experience

[0:44:07] <%Zombrocom> Why are you taking cover from the lost
[0:44:08] <Mister_McDerp> oh no
[0:44:09] <%Shadicara> Fun*
[0:44:12] <%UvBenServed> Take that truck
[0:44:12] <%Ultimatefool> If only there was a weapon that killed multiple enemies at once
[0:44:13] <+Randomxdfun> Nuke it from orbit fam
[0:44:14] <%kekkerscrew> Good
[0:44:14] <%Alopekis> Shoulda used a grenade
[0:44:15] <%king_wragles> Why DID Pat make one of his XCOMs sound like a dying Speak N' Spell?
[0:44:16] <%Jaxnos> OH, NEXT TIME HUH?
[0:44:16] <%Bailey__gaming> does xcom 2 explain why human hate the android
[0:44:18] <Mister_McDerp> great sniping LUL
[0:44:28] <ChloeFleurage> pat, the lost don't have bullets, why are you using cover
[0:44:28] <%Laecerelius> Look, you have to protect yourself against their ranged melee attacks
[0:44:34] <Heyestus> overwatch does have an aim penalty, it's better to shoot when you can @PatStaresAt
[0:44:38] <%rabbi_hyman_krustofsky> Also make sure she knows her butthole is visible while cooking
[0:44:45] <%king_wragles> @Bailey__gaming I think it's because people hating using the robots in the first XCOM
[0:44:48] <%King_Wolf_Rigger> Visible butt
[0:44:55] <C24U> Wait are they in the

[0:45:03] <Mister_McDerp> what a machine PogChamp
[0:45:05] <+randomarsehole> going into cover in xcom is just built into the dna, you always do it

[0:45:48] <%kekkerscrew> People don't like using robots in Xcom because they feel any character that doesn't level up might as well not exist. Luckily robots in Xcom 2 can level so people use them

[0:58:27] <%maenos2> you cna EASILY make the snake thing work
[0:58:28] <Mister_McDerp> its the correct choice

[0:58:33] <%Alopekis> Have you seen Monster Musume? You can make the snek thing work.
[0:58:33] <%Valdorick> Just stick it in her cloaca
[0:58:33] <%Ultimatefool> "Asking for a friend" Kappa
[0:58:36] <%aishman> @PatStaresAt You're supposed to say "I'll love her no matter what she becomes."

[0:58:40] <%j0ustar> A tiny hat will solve that issue for Pat
[0:58:41] <%ScottishMadJacko> I mean, itd be nice for her to have a working neck and not one made of glass
[0:58:44] <%Daniel_Is_I> Pat can't hit the back if Paige is 30 feet long.
[0:58:47] <Onatamana> Paige can become a snek and Pat will turn into a skeleton.

[1:00:00] <%Daniel_Is_I> That sounds like getting a dozen hours into Path of Exile and realizing you don't have enough health bonuses.
