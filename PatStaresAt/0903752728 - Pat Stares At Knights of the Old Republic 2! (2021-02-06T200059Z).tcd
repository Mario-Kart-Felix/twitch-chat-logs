[0:21:18] <Aydarkzero> it sure was great

[0:22:22] <%Ixiah> @UncleAWOL why exactly ?
[0:22:25] <+shry7> whats wrong with the exposure

[0:24:49] <%RetributionP> fuck I want to play so bad

[0:25:25] <%Bailey__gaming> Destiny 2 is such a shit show
[0:25:27] <+D00msDayDan> i can't believe exodus crash wasn't among the strikes they removed

[0:26:04] <cyclog> Pat its not a joke there is a subreddit called /r/destinyfashion
[0:26:04] <%weissguard> Final Fashion and Fashion Frame
[0:26:05] <+D00msDayDan> you can't sunset fashion, only powercreep it
[0:26:06] <%AzureGale> Love me a good Fashion Fantasy
[0:26:07] <%cephalon_nyt> Fashionframe FTW
[0:26:08] <%a_goth_pancake> I mean I can run lake of shadows fifty times a day, but once nightfall is navota I have no desire to play for a week.
[0:26:09] <+Real_Hornet> I mean transmog is coming to Destiny this year so the fashion show still exists
[0:26:15] <cyclog> they literally play the game for dressing up
[0:26:15] <%UncleAWOL> "The game is good now" "The game is bad now" repeat every few months
[0:26:24] <@SSaryn> And also paid armor is a coin flip.
[0:26:25] <PocketBearIllustrator> I just like making my Roe sexy/badass in FFXIV.
[0:26:36] <%RetributionP> I started playing recently and my glamor is still the noctus heavy armor for my pld.
[0:26:37] <%Retinolgaming> Destinys grind is insane
[0:26:39] <%doc_ock_rokc> I tried to get into destiny but i dont know what I was doing
[0:27:01] <TrollKing96> What do you call games that get constant updates and can result in a game being good or bad for periods of time instead of STAYING good or bad?
[0:27:04] <@SSaryn> Fucking wow
[0:27:05] <Aydarkzero> @doc_ock_rokc it doesn't do a good job at teaching new players
[0:27:11] <cookieclickerfad> destiny 2 new light is convoluted as fuuuuck
[0:27:19] <%a_goth_pancake> every piece of armor you've ever unlocked in collections will be a transmog
[0:27:21] <Aydarkzero> it's true all of my friends literally stopped playing
[0:27:25] <pk_piss> i cant imagine dropping a game for genshin impact lol
[0:27:30] <%discordlord45> discordlord45 subscribed at Tier 1. They've subscribed for 21 months! 
[0:27:30] <+bvanbove> Destiny is one of the most fun games I've played that I just don't want to play anymore because of it's game loop.
[0:27:51] <%UncleAWOL> Yup
[0:27:53] <%Monkeyweed21> Transmog will also cost silver or bright dust @PatStaresAt
[0:27:53] <SociallyAwkwardToaster> As i recall they promised transmog over a YEAR ago back when shadowkeep was announced
[0:28:04] <%UncleAWOL> I did not pick the best mmo-ish game to jump into in open beta
[0:28:06] <%RetributionP> 'but it's first person you can't see it"
[0:28:15] <+D00msDayDan> it will pull from collections, i don't remember if there's any cost to it
[0:28:17] <Aydarkzero> @Monkeyweed21 pretty sure it's just bright dust
[0:28:19] <%maenos2> It's always weird to me the people that are against transmog. wow has a small subset that haaaaates it.
[0:28:23] <+Real_Hornet> @sociallyawkwardtoaster they announced it but said it would be out later
[0:28:23] <+Patch_TheSquid> my whole friend group bailed on Destiny 2 pretty early, but we have one friend who will die on the hill that destiny 2 is the greatest game. we don't understand it.
[0:28:24] <@SSaryn> WAIT REALLY
[0:28:26] <%BallerSwagBro9k> Vampire Masquerade Bloodlines 2 confirmed for December
[0:28:27] <@SSaryn> IS THAT TRUE
[0:28:35] <%Retinolgaming> They need to just make dye and transmog free or cost glimmer
[0:28:36] <+Real_Hornet> @ssaryn no
[0:28:39] <+Ancopro> back in and baaaaack out
[0:28:41] <@SSaryn> IS THIS ONE GUY
[0:28:41] <Aydarkzero> you can't buy bright dust
[0:28:48] <+Real_Hornet> They havent announced how its gonna be
[0:28:55] <cyclog> @BallerSwagBro9k is it really ?
[0:29:03] <+illusiveSaint> i really want bloodlines 2 to be good but the trailer giving me doubts :(
[0:29:05] <KosOrSomeSayKosm_> I don't play destiny but that sounds LIKE ASS JESUS WHY
[0:29:06] <%a_goth_pancake> bd can't be bought, only earned by bounties.
[0:29:06] <%doc_ock_rokc> mmmm
[0:29:08] <%crimsonharvest> Destiny 2 confused me because they wanted me to play it constantly but not really offer me anything for it
[0:29:12] <%KeiganOfAstora> @SSaryn Wasn't me
[0:29:14] <%1000_buffers> I am feeling so smug since i do not play any of these types of games and will never have to feel these feelings @PatStaresAt
[0:29:16] <+D00msDayDan> is that the statement from a few weeks ago or from last year?
[0:29:29] <%gksnipa> even nioh 1 had this an option
[0:29:33] <+Real_Hornet> @d00msdaydan probably from the stuff last year
[0:29:34] <%gksnipa> ands its not an mmo
[0:29:34] <%W1nterTitan> :(
[0:29:46] <%RetributionP> why do we have to use currency fake or otherwise to look good
[0:29:47] <%crimsonharvest> Cause this might be a fucked up take but the character armors in destiny look like garbage, like middleschool cosplay
[0:29:49] <Aydarkzero> "action" mmo
[0:29:53] <cookieclickerfad> bungie has went through so many business models and this is absolutely the most anti-consuker
[0:29:57] <Aydarkzero> it's really frustrating
[0:29:57] <%Broand> I knew keeping distance from destiny was a good idea
[0:30:01] <%BallerSwagBro9k> @cyclog Yup Epic Games posted the date December 12
[0:30:02] <%Monkeyweed21> "In-game effort" aka weeks worth of bright dust or some shit like that
[0:30:12] <@SSaryn> Can we get a shooter MMO, which is hopefully Outriders, that is ANY FUCKING GOOD FOR IT'S ENTIRETY.
[0:30:19] <%Mrbaconator> @PatStaresAt but EA runs entire companies into the ground on the regular isn't that more incompetent
[0:30:21] <HotMafia81> Doc is great people
[0:30:24] <cookieclickerfad> IM HERE FOR IT
[0:30:28] <%Monkeyweed21> @SSaryn lol no
[0:30:28] <%Sotetsu> I'm okay with 20 minutes of that
[0:30:30] <%AzureGale> Blights of the Old Republic
[0:30:32] <cyclog> @BallerSwagBro9k thanks couldn't find it
[0:30:33] <+Real_Hornet> @ssaryn What color do you want your dragon to be?
[0:30:40] <Fien111> Oh no, someone pushed the "MAn, FUCK DESTINY" button again?
[0:30:41] <OldManDeckardCain> SHENMUE
[0:30:44] <%RetributionP> what if brink makes a come back as a mmo type game
[0:30:49] <+Patch_TheSquid> Shooter MMO, but dark urban fantasy setting. please. Hellgate london, but good.
[0:30:55] <%Monkeyweed21> YU SUZUKI WHY
[0:30:57] <%WizardPants1134> i have already forgot Kotor
[0:31:00] <+Real_Hornet> Puke Smith fucked my wife and sent my guns to the ground
[0:31:03] <%a_goth_pancake> whether we wanted it or not, next season we've stepped into a war with the cabal... again.
[0:31:05] <PocketBearIllustrator> Yeah, I remember getting a PS4 bundle with Destiny 2 for Christmas, and I barely touched it.
[0:31:12] <%a_goth_pancake> luke smith.
[0:31:27] <%Sotetsu> Games hire economists these days so they squeeze as much money out of the player as possible.
[0:31:30] <Flame_Water> what wver happened to warframe?
[0:31:33] <%Tman451> joe staten
[0:31:43] <+D00msDayDan> except for the season about gambit
[0:31:50] <+Real_Hornet> @patstaresat he also directed Taken King which is what people say is the other good expansion
[0:31:57] <Aydarkzero> Gambit Season LUL
[0:32:04] <%Monkeyweed21> @Flame_Water its still going along
[0:32:08] <%crimsonharvest> Yes it was shit
[0:32:11] <%maenos2> lol no I remember shit crashing
[0:32:12] <%Nekros4442> Literally did it just this October
[0:32:20] <%Puhff> Oh god
[0:32:20] <%rumtumtugnutz> yeah
[0:32:23] <%Nekros4442> We had WoW Classic do it as well Pat
[0:32:27] <Psyramics> No, cause it hapened at like 3 in the morning, and the servers could not handle it
[0:32:27] <Zeikier> Anchorage :V
[0:32:28] <Jacob_Struggles> Yes! WHat a nightmare!!
[0:32:36] <%maenos2> It's anchorage but said weirdly
[0:32:38] <%Dakuu75> the place where you fight the big anubis guys?
[0:32:39] <Aydarkzero> god damn it not the scarab bs again
[0:32:46] <%RetributionP> oh I remember soloing that for gear
[0:32:51] <+illusiveSaint> i think i remember this.. and nothing happened
[0:32:52] <Ras_Aku> Oh yes i remember that shit show good times
[0:32:56] <GustauveVIII> GONG
[0:33:00] <%maenos2> it was a scepter
[0:33:15] <Sunstalker> Pat, did you see the angry dipshits over miranda's ass shots in the remake being removed? kinamaLUL
[0:33:26] <Aydarkzero> literally ONE GUY power
[0:33:35] <Jacob_Struggles> And a mount!!!
[0:33:41] <%xMaSterKeef420bluntNinjAx> woolieONEGUY
[0:33:45] <@SSaryn> That's extremely cool.. on paper.
[0:33:50] <Aydarkzero> ye
[0:33:54] <+Real_Hornet> This is gonna turn into how Luke Smith is a Scarab Lord, just watch
[0:33:54] <%BallerSwagBro9k> THE 1%
[0:33:54] <$SGrim> @Sunstalker so they're butt mad? Keepo
[0:34:00] <%maenos2> In my time of playing WoW from release to today, I ha e only ever seen ONE scarab Lord.
[0:34:16] <%Dakuu75> lol, nice
[0:34:18] <Aydarkzero> wow
[0:34:26] <SmolBluGhost> jeez lmao
[0:34:30] <%JumboCrunchies> Yeah, you did not do that shit, back in Classic days
[0:34:33] <Aydarkzero> omg
[0:34:38] <GarbageQueenEllie> lol
[0:34:40] <%BallerSwagBro9k> HMMMMMMM
[0:34:41] <%cylish> oh wow
[0:34:42] <GustauveVIII> @patstaresat if you banged the gong within 10 hours of the first player banging it, you'd also get the scarab lord title too
[0:34:42] <%xMaSterKeef420bluntNinjAx> That explains a lot
[0:34:47] <SociallyAwkwardToaster> that...explains literally everything
[0:34:47] <Aydarkzero> i was there
[0:34:52] <%W1nterTitan> OH fuck "You had to be there"
[0:34:53] <%cylish> thats.... the totally wrong lesson to take from that game
[0:34:54] <Fien111> Oh that explains a lot.....
[0:34:55] <Aydarkzero> but i'm not enjoying my self
[0:34:55] <%UncleAWOL> Oh my god that explains A LOT
[0:35:09] <+Midashu> Pump and Dump economy
[0:35:12] <Pookiedaexzile> Fake Fomo
[0:35:14] <Aydarkzero> you had to be there the Cabal just pulled out a dildo
[0:35:18] <@SSaryn> FOMO is a powerful tool but BOY.
[0:35:20] <+Real_Hornet> Now the things are staying in the game for a year
[0:35:23] <GarbageQueenEllie> Wasn't this on a South Park episode?
[0:35:26] <%rumtumtugnutz> Destiny 2 is an FOMOMMORPG
[0:35:29] <%justcallmebobplease> Is it a misunderstanding when they do it intentionally?
[0:35:29] <Fien111> The pieces have fallen into place and the jigsaw picture is of a piece of poop
[0:35:31] <penitentpendant> The Title for the Firmament is FF14's take on it
[0:35:39] <%rumtumtugnutz> FOMMORPG?
[0:35:41] <%a_goth_pancake> corridors of time was the worst of that feeling.
[0:35:42] <%BallerSwagBro9k> Wow its almost like MMOs are all inherently bad Kappa
[0:35:42] <%Tman451> @rumtumtugnutz thats a great way to put it
[0:35:43] <Pookiedaexzile> How about go fuck yourself Bungie
[0:35:44] <ToneBacas> predatory FOMO
[0:35:50] <%Broand> Fomomurperger
[0:35:55] <%SomeSageAdvice> yeah the Firmament is a great example of a good way
[0:35:59] <SmolBluGhost> its probably why i stopped at destiny instead of going to 2
[0:36:00] <%Monkeyweed21> half the content in the game
[0:36:03] <@commanderclaw> Negative reinforcement rather than positive reinforcement
[0:36:11] <%W1nterTitan> A gun that is broken in PVP
[0:36:16] <+Real_Hornet> @patstaresat they make big money from the cash shop actually
[0:36:19] <SociallyAwkwardToaster> If you check SteamDB, the player count loses up to 10k players every month
[0:36:27] <penitentpendant> It's turned to ROMO (Resigned On Missing Out) for me
[0:36:37] <@SSaryn> As much as I hate to say it, Destiny could learn a lot from the Gachas.
[0:36:38] <Pookiedaexzile> Hold people hostage, Only they can walk away at anytime
[0:36:39] <%Sotetsu> Oh boy, candy
[0:36:41] <%justcallmebobplease> I don't understand the metaphor, can you rephrase it to work with chocolate?
[0:36:43] <%G_Thunders> I feel like that’s kind of how WoW raids worked though? You had to be on at specific times on specific nights, it was just managed by your guild rather than blizzard
[0:36:51] <Aydarkzero> @SSaryn monkaS
[0:36:54] <%AkronymCLT> Is there any equivalent to a rest bonus in Destiny?
[0:36:56] <Fien111> ESO kinda does that. The log-in bonuses for the month SUCK.....except for the last 4
[0:37:05] <+illusiveSaint> genshin impact type beat Kappa
[0:37:05] <sajuk_khar> Didn't they quit Activision?
[0:37:10] <otterlyhyped> Man, I really wished I liked Destiny more. I like playing the game, but everything thing else about it...
[0:37:12] <GarbageQueenEllie> And that's why I don't play mobile
[0:37:16] <Aydarkzero> @AkronymCLT you get it every reset for 5 levels
[0:37:25] <DJ_Fadeaway> Kotr
[0:37:28] <%Monkeyweed21> Genshin Impact is predatory as fuck but at least they wont remove my characters at some point
[0:37:43] <Aydarkzero> that weapon skin is pretty rad though Kappa
[0:37:43] <penitentpendant> I still go back to Warframe once in a while. But I haven't touched Destiny 2 since I left it
[0:37:44] <+PenmanLupine> the SFV costume pieces were the worst
[0:37:45] <SociallyAwkwardToaster> god that battlepass sucks, i chased it for two months and it absolutely killed my interest in the game
[0:37:46] <%W1nterTitan> Or just buy it with silver instead of grinding
[0:37:47] <%KishinGrek> Yeesh
[0:37:52] <@SSaryn> Yeah at least with the Genshin battle pass, the weapons are like.. a little more than halfway in there.
[0:37:56] <Pookiedaexzile> People defiending Destiny like it s even gonna be the same game after they take all the shit out
[0:37:58] <%Sotetsu> That reminds me, I need to log into Princess Connect today. fmgS
[0:38:01] <Aydarkzero> Recluse?
[0:38:13] <+D00msDayDan> and then they sunset that legendary so get yourself fucked
[0:38:16] <GustauveVIII> @PatStaresAt you can do public group raids that depends on your average item level now so it's basically "how patient are you with random people that can either be really great or fucking awful"
[0:38:16] <%Monkeyweed21> @PenmanLupine at least you can buy those costumes for like 3 bucks later
[0:38:18] <Aydarkzero> cause Recluse rekt ass that's why
[0:38:18] <%AdamElJefe> @sajuk_khar bungie and activision separated in 2019
[0:38:21] <%crimsonharvest> is it the memory dance
[0:38:26] <%Sotetsu> sipsipDab
[0:38:28] <Pookiedaexzile> Memory Dance
[0:38:31] <cookieclickerfad> oops all sunsetted
[0:38:33] <+Real_Hornet> @ssaryn its just a cosmetic skin high on the pass, if you buy the pass you get it instantly or free at level 30+
[0:38:41] <%GinAndRoses> perform the jig of recollection
[0:38:49] <GarbageQueenEllie> "I can't remember the Memory Jogginh dance!!!"
[0:38:56] <+demon1103> its sad, the Battle pass systems could be amazing...if they just removed the time limit on paid versions.*sigh*
[0:38:57] <%Broand> I had a rubber chicken in Runescape and all the people who went hard in that I knew could never get it because it was a holiday item, they were quite jelly
[0:38:58] <@SSaryn> Yeah that's the main thing but at least it all wasn't relegated to the highest level is what I mean.
[0:39:08] <penitentpendant> I know there are a lot of complaints about FF14 being a 'stat stick' system. But there ARE some benefits to it.
[0:39:11] <2sappy> I did that grind once to get all 3 solstice armor sets and it immediately got left in the past. didn't play D2 for a year after that.
[0:39:27] <Aydarkzero> i wouldn't have minded if Pinnacle weapons got sunset but not the whole armory
[0:39:27] <%Ascethetic> @patstaresat but Riskrunner tho
[0:39:41] <%Monkeyweed21> rip my Last Word skin
[0:39:46] <%a_goth_pancake> recluse still tears ass, just not in PvP or nightfall.
[0:39:49] <Pookiedaexzile> They deprecated alright, right over the whole game
[0:39:53] <%Dakuu75> what's the point of adding loot, that your gonna restrict-the-shit out of
[0:40:03] <@SSaryn> Pretty weapon
[0:40:22] <Aydarkzero> i STILL haven't found a replacement for my Chest piece and it's sunsetting next Tue
[0:40:24] <@SSaryn> WAIT WHAT
[0:40:26] <Pookiedaexzile> Don't gotta make a new weapon if they just steal em back
[0:40:29] <cookieclickerfad> It's so we can grind even HARDER
[0:40:51] <+alphonseisbest> what game is this?
[0:41:00] <+alphonseisbest> oh destiny
[0:41:01] <%Ascethetic> Destiny
[0:41:01] <SociallyAwkwardToaster> @alphonseisbest destiny 2
[0:41:02] <+alphonseisbest> ew
[0:41:08] <Aydarkzero> i just know those Dreaming City weapons aren't going to have any new perks
[0:41:19] <Pookiedaexzile> "Reissued, this digital model and stat set"
[0:41:21] <%templar010> Its fucking clown shoes shit
[0:41:22] <Aydarkzero> Morgeth encounter again LUL
[0:41:25] <Pookiedaexzile> Bullshit
[0:41:26] <@SSaryn> That literally feels like, NIN and SCH can't be used in this tier because they just didn't get weapons for 2 patches in a row.
[0:41:30] <%SirGO0SE> Destiny is a fucking scam
[0:41:34] <%Puhff> REGRIND?!
[0:41:37] <%cephalon_nyt> really? ew.
[0:41:40] <+Real_Hornet> @aydarkzero they are, if you do shattered throne
[0:41:47] <%Puhff> Fuuuuuuck that
[0:41:51] <rawrmeowxd> what typa keyboard is that tho? lol sorry idk what game you're talking about
[0:41:56] <%cylish> Welcome to keeping up with tourny legal decks in magic
[0:41:57] <%crimsonharvest> I get a big feeling of "no applause for solving problems you caused" about Destiny
[0:41:58] <+Ancopro> is sunsetting like trying to fade out previous stuff
[0:41:59] <Aydarkzero> i didn't do the new raid at all this season
[0:42:07] <@SSaryn> Hmmmmmmmm
[0:42:13] <%Monkeyweed21> lol I remember that
[0:42:18] <Pookiedaexzile> Don't gotta make a new model if you take the weapons back
[0:42:19] <%Divryne> Don't you dare mention Illya strat Pat.
[0:42:25] <Aydarkzero> oh
[0:42:27] <GarbageQueenEllie> oof
[0:42:29] <Pookiedaexzile> Wait what?
[0:42:39] <+takutoots> ?

[0:42:58] <GarbageQueenEllie> Moar like Mr Crappy! Gottim
[0:43:03] <+Real_Hornet> @patstaresat second way was right
[0:43:04] <%Divryne> Shut up SSaryn MTQ does shit guides.
[0:43:14] <%Divryne> She doesn't even clear in her own guides kek
[0:43:15] <@SSaryn> @Divryne You say everything is shit
[0:43:23] <@SSaryn> Oh fuck really is that true
[0:43:27] <%SirGO0SE> forget new content, thats crazy LUL
[0:43:29] <@SSaryn> Cause if so fuck me
[0:43:29] <Sunstalker> That's some bad reasoning
[0:43:29] <Pookiedaexzile> MAKE MORE SHIT IDIOT
[0:43:30] <%Divryne> Cause everything is shit you fool.
[0:43:30] <Aydarkzero> right
[0:43:32] <%SirGO0SE> yeah
[0:43:34] <Pookiedaexzile> ITS A MODEL
[0:43:34] <%Divryne> LUL
[0:43:35] <%cylish> Maybe if your game is only grinding you fucked up on its design
[0:43:40] <cookieclickerfad> but the devs didn't have an equal amount of replacements
[0:43:40] <%AncelDeLambert> oh god has Pat been talking about FF14 the entire stream?
[0:43:51] <V0LK__> WTF, just ask for a new game instead of taking our stuff away, the point of the game is getting loot T_T'
[0:43:57] <%Ascethetic> @anceldelambert nah, we shittin on Destiny today
[0:44:12] <%Mrbaconator> ye but have you considered MMMM me?
[0:44:32] <%SirGO0SE> if there ever is a Destiny 3, they couldn't get me to download it if they paid me. they've burned the bridge with this customer
[0:44:35] <Aydarkzero> it's true LUL
[0:44:40] <rawrmeowxd> loot grinding kills my soul man
[0:44:43] <@SSaryn> Feels like he just needs to find another fucking game to play.
[0:44:53] <+Whiskey_T_Foxtrot> Monkey's Paw
[0:44:53] <Fien111> that dog snore loud
[0:44:55] <GarbageQueenEllie> **Influencer**
[0:44:56] <V0LK__> ^^^^^agree
[0:44:58] <%Pappajimbo> he monkey pawed that shit
[0:44:59] <%W1nterTitan> Oops!
[0:45:02] <Pookiedaexzile> Hoisted by his own Bitch ass Petards
[0:45:04] <%walternatorz> is there a vacuum running in the background?
[0:45:08] <+oktavia_von> most of the missions for this season was exotic ships
[0:45:15] <%Puhff> Now do warframe
[0:45:16] <MegalomaniacalMegalodon> I don't think I've ever heard a dog snore so loud lol
[0:45:19] <$KishinGrek> 30 mins later...
[0:45:19] <%a_goth_pancake> new deep rock galactic update just came out, added two new maps.
[0:45:20] <+Real_Hornet> @sirgo0se which is why they arent doing a Destiny 3, because its gonna make D2 entirely worthless like what they did to D1
[0:45:20] <Aydarkzero> if you aren't complaining about your game do you actually love it?
[0:45:22] <@SSaryn> So who do we blame the Division 1 and 2 for that's what I wanna know
[0:45:35] <+Midashu> Vets love to whine about games they care about
[0:45:40] <%walternatorz> there's a vacuum running rampant in your house, pat
[0:45:41] <%SirGO0SE> @Real_Hornet "going to make"
[0:45:41] <%Monkeyweed21> @SSaryn i dunno some rapist probably
[0:45:44] <rawrmeowxd> why do you call paige babe??? lol
[0:45:46] <%SirGO0SE> heh
[0:45:47] <@SSaryn> YE
[0:45:48] <%psidefx> Ye it is
[0:45:54] <umbraawitch> i thought destiny was good a year ago
[0:45:54] <%Pappajimbo> dont chug the fish oil
[0:45:56] <MegalomaniacalMegalodon> Oh I fucked up with cold medicine once in college forgot I hadn't had breakfast and it wrecked me
[0:46:03] <Aydarkzero> i'm waiting for the demo
[0:46:04] <%Monkeyweed21> aww man I cant wait for Godfall 2
[0:46:07] <@SSaryn> That demo is gonna be very crucial.
[0:46:09] <Pookiedaexzile> thats the gears of war type one?
[0:46:20] <+fockniapo> Pat looks like a normal person today
[0:46:22] <$MrPedrovsky> Not being able to Party in a free trial that is only for 30 days and like until lvl 30 made me not want to play 14 at all
[0:46:22] <Pookiedaexzile> Like 3rd person
[0:46:25] <+Real_Hornet> @sirgo0se it still gets the big money so i mean, people said Destiny has been dying since WEEK 1
[0:46:25] <+oktavia_von> oof
[0:46:26] <+fockniapo> Im glad
[0:46:26] <GarbageQueenEllie> Destiny is Destiny
[0:46:27] <umbraawitch> so flip floppy lol
[0:46:41] <2sappy> which diablo though?
[0:46:41] <Pookiedaexzile> Damn
[0:46:42] <cookieclickerfad> which is weird because so many things tried to be destiny
[0:46:48] <cookieclickerfad> and none of them worked
[0:46:51] <rawrmeowxd> Bungie turned into shit
[0:47:16] <+Real_Hornet> @patstaresat you can say the same for RoosterTeeth’s glassdoor
[0:47:17] <+Whiskey_T_Foxtrot> Glassdoor is basically company PR, it's super astroturfed and they eventually hide bad reviews when PR dies down.
[0:47:22] <Pookiedaexzile> bruh I love Glassdoor, Checkout Riot too for a sad night
[0:47:39] <+Real_Hornet> Yeah you right Pat
[0:47:41] <%SirGO0SE> LUL
[0:47:41] <%psidefx> Cliques ruin a lot of game building
[0:47:46] <GarbageQueenEllie> Ppl w/ glass doors can throw stones
[0:47:47] <Aydarkzero> LUL
[0:47:48] <rawrmeowxd> bookmarked that website lol
[0:47:54] <Iwashi94> wooooow
[0:47:55] <GustauveVIII> @PatStaresAt do you think they would've made halo worse if they had managed to own the IP?
[0:48:08] <%JobbedBone> mugshot site business model LUL
[0:48:08] <+Real_Hornet> @patstaresat Yelp but for literally every company
[0:48:09] <Fien111> Well.......at least they lose money to do that
[0:48:09] <%JumboCrunchies> Glassdoor is, admittedly, one of those websites that is pretty much only used to bitch about jobs you hated. There are like NO positive reviews.
[0:48:11] <+Whiskey_T_Foxtrot> It's still good for "oh wow, this company is so bad that they didn't even get them all removed!"
[0:48:11] <rawrmeowxd> LMAOOO
[0:48:18] <$MrPedrovsky> @patstaresat Not being able to Party in a 14 free trial that is only for 30 days and like until lvl 30 made me not want to play 14 at all. Should i even bother?
[0:48:20] <%Daxalog> Good way to make money from people you know have fat stacks of cash. Business owners
[0:48:20] <+captain_thickthighs> s
[0:48:22] <penitentpendant> It was fascinating seeing the FF14 curtain be pulled aside last night and that guy dunk on Yoshi P.
[0:48:23] <+captain_thickthighs> so
[0:48:48] <AShinyVagikarp> True
[0:48:54] <%Monkeyweed21> remember that ex-Valve employee talking about how you have to lock your workstation cuz coworkers will sabotage you because everyone competes for bonuses
[0:48:58] <+captain_thickthighs> so whats the main ingredient that shit the destiny pot
[0:49:01] <+captain_thickthighs> c
[0:49:02] <+oktavia_von> shotguns are overpowered
[0:49:07] <%Daxalog> Destiny pvp should just use standardized guns or something.
[0:49:11] <+captain_thickthighs> can't they just have a
[0:49:12] <%Divryne> Delete PVP.
[0:49:13] <penitentpendant> Seperate the PvP stats already
[0:49:14] <+alphonseisbest> @MrPedrovsky the free trial is till the end of the first expac now, tho the other restrictions are still there
[0:49:17] <+captain_thickthighs> can't they just have a mode where everybody has the same guns
[0:49:17] <Pookiedaexzile> Its almost like you should have guns with equipment that can change stats
[0:49:20] <%Monkeyweed21> but no new content for PVP ever
[0:49:24] <otterlyhyped> Halo's strongest point is it's simplicity
[0:49:32] <%psidefx> Iron banner eternally
[0:49:32] <+Whiskey_T_Foxtrot> EXACTLY. Let people do what they want!
[0:49:34] <otterlyhyped> I still play it every day and it's like 20 years old now
[0:49:35] <Aydarkzero> so the usual
[0:49:39] <%JobbedBone> what if Goldeneye had weekly balance patches
[0:49:42] <%Monkeyweed21> NO NEW MAPS ONLY BAD NERFS
[0:49:42] <+Caidezes> I'll just stick with Warframe.
[0:49:46] <rawrmeowxd> The randomized gun thing sounds really tedious and annoying imo
[0:49:46] <umbraawitch> this is so weird to hear bc i could've sworn this game was considered great
[0:49:53] <rekinom> Making around 2,000 servings of raid food to sell on Tuesday baybeeeeeee
[0:49:55] <Fien111> For Glory and For Fuck Sake
[0:49:56] <+Whiskey_T_Foxtrot> That would be admitting failure as a game designer though, so bungie employees would never go for it
[0:49:57] <%Mrbaconator> i want a PVP mode that's imbalanced on purpose literally called "Complete Fucking Mess"
[0:50:02] <%psidefx> That'd be worth it
[0:50:03] <%Pappajimbo> dark olympics: take all the drugs
[0:50:03] <%Divryne> That's why Warframe doesn't do anything with PvP anymore.
[0:50:07] <%SomeSageAdvice> @umbraawitch it WAS lol
[0:50:17] <Pookiedaexzile> Nah, Standardized guns, add on are custom. Different scopes and magazine sizes
[0:50:20] <%W1nterTitan> SO trials
[0:50:22] <+Real_Hornet> @umbraawitch it still is
[0:50:25] <+captain_thickthighs> shame I specifically got into destiny because it going to play Warframe anymore cuz my PC s*** it's pants
[0:50:27] <CursedNobleman> LUL
[0:50:33] <rawrmeowxd> People should just go back to MCC lol
[0:50:35] <%Monkeyweed21> Imagine thinking Destiny PvP will ever get new content
[0:50:39] <%doc_ock_rokc> Put in those cheat traps that that one fake cheater guy makes
[0:50:42] <umbraawitch> @SomeSageAdvice @Real_Hornet im getting some conflicting opinions here LOL
[0:50:43] <Fien111> Halo had that, didn't it?
[0:50:48] <CursedNobleman> ?
[0:50:49] <%BallerSwagBro9k> GUN GAME IS GREAT
[0:50:50] <ColbyBryant> halo announcer voice: "Shit Show"
[0:50:51] <%BakiinPlaysStuff> They had fiesta where you get 2 random weapons when you respawn
[0:50:55] <%JobbedBone> give you a random broken binding of isaac build every time
[0:50:57] <+Real_Hornet> @umbraawitch the duality of vidya
[0:51:03] <%Dakuu75> sic
[0:51:03] <%doc_ock_rokc> @PatStaresAt Tabs Battleground
[0:51:05] <Pookiedaexzile> Reincarnation game
[0:51:09] <AShinyVagikarp> There are mods for Halo 4 that do that exact thing
[0:51:13] <CursedNobleman> MONKEY GUN TIMESPLITTERS.
[0:51:16] <%Tman451> oh no my gun shoots backwards

[0:51:30] <otterlyhyped> A randomized stat sheet every spawn sounds awesome actually
[0:51:34] <Pookiedaexzile> Samsara the Game

[0:51:38] <%WizardPants1134> WANT
[0:51:40] <+Whiskey_T_Foxtrot> Halo: Rainbow Edition
[0:51:45] <%Pappajimbo> oopss no gravity
[0:51:46] <+Real_Hornet> @rawrmeowxd no its what Pat wants as a big fucked up gamemode
[0:51:48] <+captain_thickthighs> what if you have a mode where you get the same load out of the person who killed you
[0:51:48] <%SomeSageAdvice> @umbraawitch long story short, if you play Destiny 2 every single day and dont mind losing tons of progress because of updates, yeah sure its great, but if you dont, oof
[0:51:53] <marvel877> What I miss?
[0:51:54] <otterlyhyped> No bugs, only features
[0:51:58] <+wah_ha_ha> Uh oh the game doesn't matchmake

[0:52:05] <%Too_Much_Nukie> Uh oh, Jimmy was sacrificed to the ether again
[0:52:06] <%SirGO0SE> uh oh, porn pop up ads
[0:52:08] <umbraawitch> @SomeSageAdvice sounds like a nightmare
[0:52:10] <+doc_ock_rokc> @PatStaresAt There is a game like that its totally accurate battleground which is a Battle royale with broken shit all over
[0:52:13] <notquitedead123> Is he talking about Cyberpunk?
[0:52:14] <%JobbedBone> bugtest it, but then strategically undo some of the bugtesting
[0:52:16] <Pookiedaexzile> So Rainbow Six Seige?
[0:52:20] <%WizardPants1134> No Bugs Only Feature
[0:52:24] <%BakiinPlaysStuff> You better hope to God that theres a bug that crashes everyones client every 10th mathc
[0:52:30] <+Real_Hornet> @patstaresat “Uh oh! All console commands are on!”

[0:53:30] <Pookiedaexzile> Mass Effects Moon is hauted

[0:53:48] <%templar010> Moon is BIG GHOSTS
[0:53:49] <Pookiedaexzile> ITs a Mission in Mass Effect one
[0:53:50] <Fien111> Moons are inhierently evil. The Apollo program used nuclear missiles as the base for the rockets just in case
[0:53:51] <+Whiskey_T_Foxtrot> Moonbase Alpha is a haunted game
[0:53:51] <%walternatorz> I'm thinking there's a reason why we haven't been back and we're now forming a Space Force.
[0:53:53] <%Ipsenscastle> even Mass Effect's moon is haunted! I forgot!
[0:53:55] <GarbageQueenEllie> Bruh, even goddamn Naruto did it

[1:12:15] <+captain_thickthighs> So are the reapers just big homophobes?
[1:12:17] <%JohnAtDawn> Your assumption that necromancy has to do with skeletons is really close minded.
[1:12:18] <Zeikier> fellas, is it gay to look at your gf's butt who is actually a clone of their dad put into a test tube?
[1:12:27] <%Ipsenscastle> @wibbwobbler yup

[1:13:23] <+alphonseisbest> no it doesn't
[1:13:24] <%walternatorz> everyone asks is it gay but no one asks how is gay
[1:13:28] <kingmemelord97> i walked away for a sec whats going on ?
[1:13:29] <rawrmeowxd> It can be like 0.5 percent even
[1:13:30] <$SGrim> 6%
[1:13:32] <%Ipsenscastle> it's pretty gay
[1:13:32] <%UvBenServed> 4/10 gays
[1:13:33] <%Deano8817> a man having sex with a woman is still 50% cause there's 1 guy there
[1:13:35] <GarbageQueenEllie> Buying desserts
[1:13:38] <+alphonseisbest> u could just say its not at all
[1:13:40] <Zeikier> how are gay

[1:13:41] <+takutoots> LUL
[1:13:43] <+alphonseisbest> thats more like it
[1:13:43] <theugliestguitar> a constant background radiation of Gay
[1:13:44] <%Monkeyweed21> Fellas is it gay to not suck dick
[1:13:45] <%wibbwobbler> just enough
[1:13:46] <Zeikier> What Doth Gay
[1:13:52] <%Taisuru> Kiwis are the name of a people which includes men so it's at least 25% gay
[1:13:53] <%TopsyCretes> 2% gay
[1:13:55] <TheFranss> Yeah but has rumor been answered about does Pat is gay?
[1:13:57] <OldManDeckardCain> is this Aang?
[1:13:58] <mesamus> some romance options were also cut per actor request like tali not wanting to be a romance for femshep
[1:14:02] <%SirGO0SE> eating a kiwi is pretty much getting raw dogged in a movie theater gay
[1:14:06] <CursedNobleman> @Monkeyweed21 how much are you thinking off dick while not sucking dick?
[1:14:06] <Broken_Sonex> How are you gay?
[1:14:11] <%TopsyCretes> how much gay
[1:14:14] <+illusiveSaint> lol swim in the gay vibes prove your heterosexuality
[1:14:17] <Pookiedaexzile> It's gay to ask if something is gay, because technically you're trying to find out a bout if something is gay
[1:14:26] <+captain_thickthighs> so lesbianism is the straightest for of sex cause there's no guys
[1:14:36] <%Monkeyweed21> @CursedNobleman not thinking about dick is the gayest thing you can do
[1:14:47] <Zeikier> how many George Michael-joules does this gayness read
[1:15:04] <%Ipsenscastle> you can only be truly straight if you're a girl having sex with a girl
[1:15:05] <OldManDeckardCain> watching non lesbian porn is indeed gay, you are watching another man;s dick
[1:15:09] <+alphonseisbest> @captain_thickthighs does that make futa the most gay then?
[1:15:23] <%Monkeyweed21> @PatStaresAt how do you feel about the new Melee having a scythe?
[1:15:27] <%JohnAtDawn> No, you aren't
[1:15:30] <%Jhylla81> Considering a kiwiw is the fruit most like a ballsack it's only the second gayest fruit after the banana, id imagine
[1:15:35] <%Dunmarkh> @alphonseisbest futa is the only straight porn
[1:15:35] <%Pappajimbo> spinnings a good trick
[1:15:39] <+alphonseisbest> yo that model flip LUL
[1:15:43] <+Whiskey_T_Foxtrot> I mean yeah that was Sheev's power

[1:15:48] <%DEETRz> no its not
[1:15:48] <penitentpendant> Scythe? No.
[1:15:49] <%Monkeyweed21> Zenos has a scythe in the trailer
[1:15:50] <+alphonseisbest> @Dunmarkh ah i see yes
[1:15:50] <Broken_Sonex> Oh hey, space curry
[1:15:50] <%Divryne> Not confirmed.
[1:15:51] <moosemonkey397> NO not confirmex
[1:15:51] <%Taisuru> No
[1:15:55] <%Agami23> no but he wore 2 grim reaper shirts in a row
[1:16:01] <Zeldrick> Not confirmed
[1:16:03] <%the22cstomp> pat, yoshi p wore 2 different children of bodom shirts
[1:16:08] <GarbageQueenEllie> Fuck Mass Effect, let Bastila be gay ffs
[1:16:10] <+captain_thickthighs> futa is only gay they don't say onii chan first
[1:16:13] <blue8moon> I mean, it's not necessarily a scythe, that's just what people think
[1:16:13] <moosemonkey397> YoshiP shirt stuff is why people thing
[1:16:16] <%SomeSageAdvice> he doesnt, Jesse Cox just thinks he does
[1:16:19] <rawrmeowxd> They should just use nagatamas smh
[1:16:22] <%Taisuru> I mean Zenos had katana and we had katana :V
[1:16:24] <penitentpendant> Yoshi did mention parallels to DRG, meaning it is LIKELY that it's maiming gear. But even that's speculation.
[1:16:31] <%Agami23> thats a pull
[1:16:38] <@SSaryn> Berserker is a good possible one honestly.
[1:16:38] <%DEETRz> people are thinking its templar as well
[1:16:40] <CursedNobleman> @captain_thickthighs futa imouto is quite the crossover
[1:16:41] <%Monkeyweed21> every shirt Yoshi-P wore from Death Metal bands
[1:16:45] <%valkuma> let tomboys exist bastila is straight

[1:32:24] <%gksnipa> even on good characters its busted
[1:32:41] <%Too_Much_Nukie> Fun Fact: Sometimes the game will have a bug here where there's still hidden sith assassins in the base.

[1:37:45] <Gruhunchously> @doc_ock_rokc The boner is SYMBOLIC
[1:37:58] <penitentpendant> I have a friend whose working on 5 at the same time
[1:38:07] <%doc_ock_rokc> @Gruhunchously team Murder moist would be a better name
[1:38:14] <%rumtumtugnutz> No
[1:38:15] <%walternatorz> is this a zangief pro tip?
[1:38:17] <MegalomaniacalMegalodon> I really need to start Bozja... but I really couldn't get into Eureka before either
[1:38:18] <heartlesshealer> oh god, sure
[1:38:18] <Broken_Sonex> Good story Pat, what incredible tale of love and loss.
[1:38:20] <rawrmeowxd> Bruh. You really on it with that game lol
[1:38:20] <%psidefx> I'm trying to sweat out my first char in FFXIV
[1:38:28] <samTUMZlettuce> Sure pat, farming sounds like a good finance move.
[1:38:43] <samTUMZlettuce> <3
[1:39:03] <penitentpendant> Passive grinding ftw
[1:39:12] <+takutoots> that would be nice
[1:39:14] <%PanicSwytch> Ok
[1:39:17] <+corrosivePaladin> bigbrain move
[1:39:19] <GarbageQueenEllie> That's a good tip. Thanx m8
[1:39:20] <albobomb> ooo neat tip
[1:39:24] <%MassConnect> crazy talk
[1:39:25] <MegalomaniacalMegalodon> yeah they were even talking about making it easy in the Live Letter already
[1:39:35] <penitentpendant> They've already said they'll nerf the first step AND change the Castrum step in a hotfix
[1:39:37] <TheFranss> Nah ignore Shadowbringer Relic Weapons. Do ARR relics instead
[1:39:39] <%psidefx> noted
[1:40:05] <Broken_Sonex> Man, I love there KOTOR 2 streams. The fact that only a couple hundred people give a shit mean I can actually talk to people.
[1:40:06] <clairePlusCat> did they nerf the .35 step in .45? or is that coming with castrum fix
[1:40:14] <MegalomaniacalMegalodon> I didn't know Japanese, but the slides were a lot about hotfixing the whole thing about the mandatory steps
[1:40:23] <GarbageQueenEllie> This one is awesome
[1:40:29] <%Too_Much_Nukie> Kreygasm
[1:40:30] <%Daxalog> My eyess!
[1:40:35] <%Monkeyweed21> they talked about nerfing previous steps with 5.55
[1:40:36] <%Too_Much_Nukie> This is my fetish
[1:40:41] <rawrmeowxd> Epic
[1:40:41] <+PrinceMush_> Im literally doing the last SB quest right now and all the post patch stuff people talk about scares me lol
[1:40:44] <Broken_Sonex> NOOOO, HE LOVES IT!
[1:40:51] <+vicar_anat> what if the two kiss?
[1:40:53] <%Pappajimbo> why why was i programmed to feel pain??
[1:40:54] <CursedNobleman> LUL
[1:40:55] <+nirvana227> LUL
[1:41:02] <%psidefx> Sounds hot
[1:41:05] <mexicansunglasses> circuit ball and cock torture
[1:41:07] <%Ipsenscastle> ooh ah a little to the left - agh
[1:41:08] <Broken_Sonex> I hope they kiss.
[1:41:16] <%Too_Much_Nukie> This is restored content btw
[1:41:20] <Gruhunchously> You were able to decipher those agonized screams eh?
[1:41:23] <%gksnipa> while boadur just watches
[1:41:30] <GarbageQueenEllie> Ehh painful torture for info is overrated. Psychological torture and gaslighting is the way to go
[1:41:53] <$ff7regackted> fucking awesome dialogue
[1:41:54] <%Monkeyweed21> @GarbageQueenEllie not very effective on a droid tho
[1:41:57] <Broken_Sonex> Man.....this guy just sucks......like holy shit.
[1:42:11] <GarbageQueenEllie> @Monkeyweed21 True, you could just hack it or smth
[1:42:11] <MegalomaniacalMegalodon> @GarbageQueenEllie something something FOUR LIGHTS
[1:42:13] <rawrmeowxd> ITS THE REAPERS!!
[1:42:15] <Too_Much_Nukie> See Disciple literally figured out the whole plot.
[1:42:15] <+takutoots> LUL
[1:42:29] <%AncelDeLambert> yeah he's boring as hell
[1:42:31] <%Monkeyweed21> she's protecting the galaxy from a bad expansion
[1:42:33] <%AncelDeLambert> it's why I always play male
[1:42:35] <TheFranss> @rawrmeowxd Tell me about the reapers
[1:42:41] <%doc_ock_rokc> Disciple isn't hype but he does figure things out before kreia mind wipes him
[1:42:47] <Broken_Sonex> Really should've used that Handmaiden mod man.
[1:42:47] <ManfredA> that's why you install the mod that lets you have Handmaiden as a girl
[1:42:50] <Gruhunchously> She wanted to save the galaxy from the Revan novel.
[1:42:50] <%Too_Much_Nukie> Valkorian was cool though.
[1:42:58] <SixxMakaveli> The Handmaiden is just better
[1:43:05] <GarbageQueenEllie> I'm literally about to finish a "No Carth" playthrough, where the second I land on Taris, I ignore him entirely
[1:43:09] <MegalomaniacalMegalodon> he's only interesting because he figures out the plot... but he's also boring because... he figured out the plot already
[1:43:17] <%asgard147> limesO
[1:43:33] <%Monkeyweed21> not all equipment is moddable
[1:43:43] <MegalomaniacalMegalodon> sort buttons need to be in all RPGs forever
[1:43:56] <heartlesshealer> Droid Assassin Rifle is moddable
[1:44:00] <Broken_Sonex> It also doesn't help that his VA is a piece of shit.
[1:44:14] <%Too_Much_Nukie> I mean you could've bought a Mandalorian Assault Rifle.
[1:44:18] <%GalacticaPhanto> @broken_sonex who's his VA?
[1:44:22] <%Monkeyweed21> Has Atton stuck his dust pillar in you yet?
[1:44:27] <TheFranss> a planetary system?
[1:44:33] <%MidnightBurst12> it's endgame stuff
[1:44:44] <%Too_Much_Nukie> You can't do the HK factory yet.
[1:44:47] <%Dunmarkh> fly probably
[1:44:51] <%Arweynn> HK factory is also part of the end sequence
[1:44:56] <GustauveVIII> @PatStaresAt its automatic storyline, you already unlocked it
[1:44:57] <Broken_Sonex> @GalacticaPhanto Don't remember. Don't care.
[1:44:57] <%Too_Much_Nukie> The HK factory happens after the Atris stuff.
[1:45:22] <%GalacticaPhanto> @broken_sonex That literally makes your statement garbage tho
[1:45:23] <%Arweynn> Nar Shadda is SUPER long
[1:45:29] <%slimmixrp> Do korriban
[1:45:29] <%asgard147> limesThink
[1:45:32] <%Arweynn> and Korriban is super short
[1:45:37] <GustauveVIII> @PatStaresAt party members dark side nar shadaa is kind of boring, imo
[1:45:38] <%baka_sugoi> UFF
[1:45:43] <%slimmixrp> Nar shadaa takes forever
[1:45:51] <Broken_Sonex> @GalacticaPhanto Can't you just look him up? Why you asking this looser?
[1:45:55] <%Too_Much_Nukie> Hanharr is boring.
[1:45:57] <OldManDeckardCain> time to meet the simp LUL
[1:46:00] <%slimmixrp> The dark side party member you get on nar shadaaa sucks
[1:46:01] <%DEETRz> but wookie
[1:46:03] <%slimmixrp> Is what he is saying
[1:46:04] <GarbageQueenEllie> Leave Disciple on Korriban for the beasts to feast on him for hydration
[1:46:08] <%MassConnect> Korriban is more interesting
[1:46:10] <danielm427> Nar shadaa is the worst
[1:46:12] <%Too_Much_Nukie> The most interesting thing about Hanharr is the stuff Kreia says when he is in your party.
[1:46:14] <heartlesshealer> boring slave wookie
[1:46:18] <rhovybear> You think Darth Nihilus gives the good succ?
[1:46:26] <lets_be_friendos> Disciple haters are dumb y'all don't pay attention to the story VapeNation
[1:46:31] <Gruhunchously> It's fucking ruined
[1:46:36] <Aydarkzero> not looking good LUL
[1:46:43] <MegalomaniacalMegalodon> yeah both Dantooine and Korriban are cool for the same reason
[1:46:45] <samTUMZlettuce> RPGS with good replay value are great in the way the last Telltale Batman Game was.
[1:46:54] <GarbageQueenEllie> Like for real, there is not even a single plant on this Planet, how tf does wildlife survive
[1:46:54] <MegalomaniacalMegalodon> Enclave and Sith Academy just wrecked
[1:46:57] <Broken_Sonex> And to think Woolie wanted Hanharr. At least Mira is fun to laugh at.
[1:47:07] <TheFranss> And then there's the MMO. With somewhat usabel infastructure
[1:47:09] <heartlesshealer> disciple gets no character development because kreia mindwipes
[1:47:22] <+JJCheeker> I like that you land where all of the tombs are
[1:47:32] <spawnzie> Jesus Atton moisturize my guy
[1:47:33] <%Too_Much_Nukie> @TheFranss Over 300 years later bro
[1:47:38] <MegalomaniacalMegalodon> If I can sharpen a hammer in Monster Hunter, I guess I can sharpen a lightsaber
[1:47:45] <%AzureGale> It's quiet... TOO quiet
[1:47:50] <%Too_Much_Nukie> Yes.
[1:48:05] <%Too_Much_Nukie> Nar Shadaa has psuedo solo stuff. Like Atton has a single solo fight.
[1:48:10] <%Too_Much_Nukie> And T3 has a short adventure.
[1:48:16] <%Too_Much_Nukie> But the real stuff is all endgame.
[1:48:30] <GarbageQueenEllie> I dunno guys, I liked Mira just fine- she has some interesting backstory
[1:48:36] <KaitlynnHere> Whu happun?
[1:48:39] <MegalomaniacalMegalodon> OH me too
[1:48:42] <%slimmixrp> Thats literally what happened to me
[1:48:49] <%slimmixrp> That amd with Atton's solo fight on nat shadaa
[1:48:51] <KaitlynnHere> Same
[1:48:55] <Broken_Sonex> It was fun. I liked the challenge.
[1:49:00] <%Too_Much_Nukie> When you go to Goto's Yacht, make sure HK goes.
[1:49:00] <KaitlynnHere> Goto has a strong butt
[1:49:03] <MegalomaniacalMegalodon> Nar Shadaa is the check on "did you work on the whole party?"
[1:49:12] <%tinyswampthing> I did and regretted jt
[1:49:12] <GustauveVIII> atton's solo fight is pretty easy... if you know how to exploit
[1:49:14] <MegalomaniacalMegalodon> Goto is ALL butt
[1:49:15] <%JJCheeker> Is there a bastilla holocron here
[1:49:15] <$RealThiele> Lady Sith
[1:49:16] <%slimmixrp> It got me stuck as a baby child cause I didn't udnerstand building party members
[1:49:34] <KaitlynnHere> I want a big titty sith gf
[1:49:47] <Broken_Sonex> @JJCheeker There should be, if Revan was dark side.
[1:49:54] <GustauveVIII> atton's solo fight is also much harder in TSLRM because of rebalanced stats :(
[1:50:07] <%Too_Much_Nukie> There is but Pat doesn't have a permacrete detonator for it. I don't think.
[1:50:07] <rawrmeowxd> goals @KaitlynnHere
[1:50:15] <$RealThiele> force choke me mommy
[1:50:16] <%asgard147> cool! limesEvil
[1:50:28] <%Monkeyweed21> Khimari's solo fight frustrated the shit out of young me
[1:50:28] <%walternatorz> is this the karen book club you're joining?
[1:50:43] <samTUMZlettuce> There are no Sith, just "evil Jedi". I hate this damn seperatist talk, Pat.
[1:50:45] <%Too_Much_Nukie> @PatStaresAt Remember the cache you opened on Dxun with explosives that I said you got off planet? There are two doors like that, one is on this planet.
[1:50:52] <GarbageQueenEllie> @walternatorz What do they read at Karen Bookclub?
[1:50:54] <KaitlynnHere> So
[1:50:57] <%Arweynn> there are detonators here for that door i think
[1:50:58] <%Too_Much_Nukie> The door requiring explosives here just gives dialogue though.
[1:51:01] <%Too_Much_Nukie> Nar Shadaa, you buy it.
[1:51:04] <KaitlynnHere> Why are all the pillars knocked over?
[1:51:10] <%Too_Much_Nukie> There _might_ be one here then.
[1:51:25] <Broken_Sonex> Oh there's like a holocron you can find if you chose Revan to be dark side.
[1:51:32] <Gruhunchously> @KaitlynnHere Too many Sith throwing OP powers around probably.
[1:51:32] <KaitlynnHere> I guess to make it look ancient or some shit
[1:51:57] <heartlesshealer> "confronted"
[1:51:57] <%Too_Much_Nukie> The hyperspace war was the big split of the jedi and the sith.
[1:52:01] <Gruhunchously> The legend of Pockets lives on.
[1:52:07] <KaitlynnHere> @gruhunchously I’d believe that
[1:52:12] <KaitlynnHere> Or earthquakes
[1:52:16] <TheFranss> Silly Pat. Doors arent real
[1:52:17] <heartlesshealer> confronted sounds too much like even footing
[1:52:23] <%JJCheeker> His gloves were pretty cool
[1:52:26] <%Monkeyweed21> you fight him during the Revan raid
[1:52:27] <%Too_Much_Nukie> Not on this planet, but yeah his fight is one of the best boss fights.
[1:52:28] <GarbageQueenEllie> How tf do you know that, Kreia? HOW DO YOU KNOW THAT----
[1:52:28] <KaitlynnHere> Uuuuhhhhh
[1:52:33] <KaitlynnHere> Oh tor
[1:52:35] <%asylumkon> not in the tombs but yeah the hk/revan raid is really good
[1:52:35] <samTUMZlettuce> I don't know about that dark web stuff, man...
[1:52:35] <%JJCheeker> There was a Droid sensitive to say
[1:52:36] <%Too_Much_Nukie> You fight HK in a different sith temple.
[1:52:39] <Broken_Sonex> No i think that was a different murder bot
[1:52:39] <+alphonseisbest> I dont remenber that
[1:52:47] <%JJCheeker> Sound
[1:52:48] <Gruhunchously> @GarbageQueenEllie She was a historian.
[1:52:55] <%Too_Much_Nukie> In TOR HK literally just waited hundreds of years for Revan to call on him again.
[1:53:14] <Gruhunchously> Can you say 'wasted potential' even harder?
[1:53:16] <KaitlynnHere> Oh snap
[1:53:16] <%JJCheeker> Oh'
[1:53:24] <samTUMZlettuce> Did HK not build an army of himself?
[1:53:29] <GarbageQueenEllie> @Gruhunchously I meant Revan's escapades. No one in that academy lived to tell anyone
[1:53:30] <$RealThiele> it was actually steroids
[1:53:37] <heartlesshealer> HMM
[1:53:38] <%Huntercd> Is Kreia a voyeur?
[1:53:46] <%Dunmarkh> If they're so magical and badass how come they're fucking dead?
[1:53:50] <heartlesshealer> all gear
[1:53:54] <%slimmixrp> Yeah pretty much
[1:53:57] <%Arweynn> no, but console commands
[1:53:58] <Broken_Sonex> @samTUMZlettuce Yes, but Biowear don't care about that.
[1:53:58] <KaitlynnHere> @realthiele but wouldn’t the drugs only get better over time?
[1:53:59] <samTUMZlettuce> @Dunmarkh TRUE
[1:54:00] <%slimmixrp> Except like certain lightsaber drops
[1:54:05] <%Too_Much_Nukie> No there's a few guaranteed drops, but there are very very few. And 90% of them are on Peragus.
[1:54:07] <+Whiskey_T_Foxtrot> I'm starting to think this Kreia lady might be a little bit suspicious dnoSHOOK
[1:54:08] <+theaceclaw> can always console command if you want lol
[1:54:11] <%Arweynn> also savescumming specific quests and shops
[1:54:11] <%slimmixrp> I got super lucky on my last run and got every single unique robe
[1:54:12] <%maenos2> half breed of what
[1:54:14] <$RealThiele> save scum a loot pinata?
[1:54:15] <%slimmixrp> Even some doubled up
[1:54:22] <%DEETRz> obsidian predicted rogue likes ahead of their time
[1:54:22] <%JJCheeker> This guy had the gloves
[1:54:27] <KaitlynnHere> Excuuuuussseee me
[1:54:29] <TapAtoLive> There's a handful of guaranteed stuff, but not much is game-changing, as far as I remember.
[1:54:31] <samTUMZlettuce> @Broken_Sonex Fank you sipsipElmo
[1:54:42] <Gruhunchously> This is the part where the writers show off how much of the books they read in preparation for the game.
[1:54:43] <GarbageQueenEllie> Ah yes, the ghost from Jedi Academy
[1:54:46] <%Too_Much_Nukie> Like you ALWAYS get a breath mask on Peragus in the lab. You ALWAYS get the cold/heat resistant gloves in a locked locker by the dormitories.
[1:55:21] <Estwilde> That's Dark Sun
[1:55:21] <samTUMZlettuce> thumpSmart
[1:55:30] <Estwilde> The dragon wizard stuff
[1:55:33] <$SirGO0SE> sithficient
[1:55:34] <$RealThiele> your enemy goes cool ill burn your children
[1:55:34] <%AncelDeLambert> inherently self-destructive
[1:55:45] <%MassConnect> and yet corporations still exist
[1:55:47] <rawrmeowxd> It's the best yea lol
[1:55:47] <Gruhunchously> The Sith during this era are so evil it's stupid.
[1:55:52] <KaitlynnHere> They draw all those jelly eyes
[1:55:53] <%AncelDeLambert> implosive
[1:55:57] <samTUMZlettuce> The Roman Horse is a Collosi.
[1:55:58] <%Too_Much_Nukie> Nihilus is a perfect representation of this.
[1:55:58] <GarbageQueenEllie> Evil will always destroy itself, as Tolkien would say
[1:55:59] <Broken_Sonex> Self- Get Fucked.
[1:56:04] <samTUMZlettuce> Trojan*
[1:56:06] <samTUMZlettuce> Hehehehe
[1:56:10] <%Too_Much_Nukie> His power is incredible but eventually he WILL destroy himself. It's inevitable.
[1:56:18] <KaitlynnHere> Other sith are like “oooh man, I want that belt so bad!” -murder-
[1:56:19] <+Whiskey_T_Foxtrot> A competent evil person could rule the star wars galaxy forever. Luckily everyone is god-damned stupid as dirt.
[1:56:29] <JetpackMcQuack> LUL
[1:56:31] <Gruhunchously> @MassConnect They have the governments of the world bailing them out every time they screw up so they can keep doing it.
[1:56:38] <%Too_Much_Nukie> @PatStaresAt Here's how you get infinite xp btw
[1:56:39] <KaitlynnHere> Heh
[1:56:41] <%Huntercd> eat them
[1:56:42] <%Too_Much_Nukie> You can do this forever.
[1:56:50] <samTUMZlettuce> They actually just stormed in on a giant horse beast. People were much smaller, back in those days.
[1:56:50] <Broken_Sonex> We don't care granny.
[1:56:55] <KaitlynnHere> Awh shit
[1:56:56] <%JJCheeker> Evil will always triumph because being good is dumb
[1:56:58] <Gruhunchously> Kreia: Don't do the thing. Karen: I will do the thing.
[1:57:03] <OldManDeckardCain> oh no, whatever will I do with this free exp Kappa
[1:57:04] <$RealThiele> test your might
[1:57:13] <Gruhunchously> HK is kicking them
[1:57:16] <heartlesshealer> no zappies
[1:57:16] <spawnzie> can't believ the game tries to get you to not loot in an RPG
[1:57:20] <Paragon_of_Laziness> robot kung-fu PogChamp
[1:57:24] <+Whiskey_T_Foxtrot> Give lucas enough time and he would have said that they are
[1:57:25] <%Daxalog> is hk supposed to be melee?
[1:57:26] <+CanonFang_> why is hk just kicking them?
[1:57:27] <samTUMZlettuce> I AM YOUR BROTHERS COUSINS SECOND ROOM-MATE
[1:57:27] <%burntbagels13> they are force lasers
[1:57:28] <Estwilde> that's the word I was looking for with Dark Sun. "Defilers" ... Using magic basically saps the life from the land and surrounding living things
[1:57:29] <$Spydurman> HK fighting hand to hand
[1:57:30] <%slimmixrp> @patstaresat HK doesnt have a gun it looks
[1:57:30] <heartlesshealer> well yeah
[1:57:31] <%AzureGale> WHAAAAAAAAAAAAAT
[1:57:34] <%maenos2> some guardians
[1:57:35] <%Too_Much_Nukie> Yes.
[1:57:36] <KaitlynnHere> Does hk not have a gun?
[1:57:40] <GarbageQueenEllie> Hey Pat? HK isnt a Monk
[1:57:44] <spawnzie> technically everything is made of the force
[1:57:47] <KaitlynnHere> Hk has a good punch
[1:57:49] <neptious> are you sure???
[1:57:53] <KaitlynnHere> No it’s fine
[1:57:53] <Broken_Sonex> Kreia is sulking about how easy that was,
[1:57:54] <Thepothero> Kung fu HK ? rooWut
[1:57:54] <heartlesshealer> did another party member steal his gun?
[1:57:58] <%JJCheeker> I think the cutscene on the ship took it away
[1:58:02] <%maenos2> HK strikes me as the sort to enjoy killing with his hands
[1:58:07] <samTUMZlettuce> They should have done more with gunplay in the TOS, and utilized the fact that blasters were all FX.
[1:58:21] <heartlesshealer> less than two years in the over
[1:58:24] <heartlesshealer> oven*
[1:58:29] <%Too_Much_Nukie> Look out Pat it's reused models from Neverwinter Nights 2!
[1:58:29] <Gruhunchously> Gotta admit, dark spirits, that was pretty lame.
[1:58:32] <samTUMZlettuce> As "Cool" as lightsabers are. You get the point after you get your first collapsible one that melts in the sun.
[1:58:33] <$RealThiele> such danger
[1:58:44] <%Too_Much_Nukie> There's a few reused models in this.
[1:58:50] <neptious> Bold of you to claim anything at all isn't made out of the force
[1:58:53] <GustauveVIII> a corpse here infinitely spawns xp-giving monsters, but only in unpatched KOTOR2
[1:58:55] <%legendscar01> This isn't resident evil
[1:58:57] <heartlesshealer> oh wow
[1:59:05] <%Arweynn> there's a body in the special cave that spawns them every time you click it, but RCM removes it. You need to download the bugged file they removed to make the glitch work again. but it's not worth it, just console/save edit yourself the xp and save 30+ minutes
[1:59:06] <+Gespens> Did y'all see the guy who made a functioning protosaber? Shits dope
[1:59:10] <samTUMZlettuce> It WILL be...
[1:59:24] <%asgard147> "Food?" psaDogchamp
[1:59:28] <Gruhunchously> Remember when Pockets bitch-slapped this guy into oblvion?
[1:59:31] <rawrmeowxd> While you were out getting a big tiddy sith gf I WAS MASTERING THE BLADE
[1:59:34] <legendscar01> Anybody excited for Warhammer 3?

[2:00:28] <Gruhunchously> Remember what absolute tools the Sith in this academy were in the last game?
[2:00:33] <%Too_Much_Nukie> Yeah in TOR it's a bit more impressive since all of these tombs got buried then re-excavated.

[2:01:27] <+Whiskey_T_Foxtrot> he deserves it
[2:01:30] <BlindGato> Just give HK a lightsaber
[2:01:31] <%Huntercd> Can he get a sword?
[2:01:32] <heartlesshealer> if only the game didn't try to make HK close range with his gun
[2:01:39] <samTUMZlettuce> WOAH

[2:02:35] <%legendscar01> Pat is one with the Force
[2:02:37] <KaitlynnHere> Raven made HK, right?
[2:02:50] <%AzureGale> This kind of sounds like Hitman music
[2:02:51] <KaitlynnHere> I wonder if it was also raven that made his new models
[2:02:52] <%Too_Much_Nukie> Yeah Revan made HK using the Star Forge.
[2:02:56] <%Too_Much_Nukie> That's why he's unique.
[2:03:03] <Gruhunchously> Someone needs to make some fan art of Karen sipping coffee while casually zapping an entire army of Sith to death with her other hand.
[2:03:35] <KaitlynnHere> So who made the shinier newer hks?
[2:03:37] <%JJCheeker> Greivis was half machine and he has a light Saber... Why not hk
[2:03:37] <GarbageQueenEllie> @Gruhunchously Visas makes the coffee extra black, like their souls.
[2:03:40] <%Too_Much_Nukie> TOR has some fun stuff with Star Forge shenanigans.
[2:03:44] <%legendscar01> Agent 47
[2:04:08] <%Too_Much_Nukie> Revan himself points out that they used a device that can create matter from the force to make ships and weaponry. Which is the most stupid and wasteful thing. They could've made ANYTHING.
[2:04:13] <%asgard147> No Robo Wizard FeelsBadMan
[2:04:26] <%Big_Dream> this was cut content
[2:04:26] <KaitlynnHere> @jjcheeker because greivis robot body was designed to wield a lightsaber?
[2:04:32] <%Big_Dream> here we go
[2:04:37] <%Too_Much_Nukie> That's the party cave.
[2:04:41] <%legendscar01> Samuel Jackson
[2:04:54] <rawrmeowxd> She's not ur mom
[2:04:54] <Gruhunchously> Party cave
[2:04:55] <%legendscar01> LUL
[2:04:56] <%Too_Much_Nukie> The cave was not cut content.
[2:04:58] <GarbageQueenEllie> @Too_Much_Nukie That's really dumb. At least make it somewhat scientific. Just a little bit.
[2:05:02] <+FingaLights> If a wizard slowly turned himself into a robot, would he keep his wizard powers?
[2:05:06] <%Too_Much_Nukie> This cave is in vanilla.
[2:05:14] <KaitlynnHere> I mean
[2:05:19] <KaitlynnHere> Aren’t all caves?
[2:05:28] <%Too_Much_Nukie> @GarbageQueenEllie It is scientific, it uses the force as an energy source to bind molecules together and create matter.
[2:05:32] <Broken_Sonex> It'll reck your shit, this cave
[2:05:35] <%Too_Much_Nukie> It's bullshit, but it's science.
[2:05:38] <Gruhunchously> This is where you hunted down those escapees from the Sith Academy in KOTOR 1
[2:05:46] <%JJCheeker> Revans should have built hk to use the light Saber
[2:05:49] <%RetributionP> that's a joke Karen would make
[2:05:54] <%legendscar01> I can see pat being a sith lord
[2:06:01] <Gruhunchously> *sad Echani noises*
[2:06:06] <GarbageQueenEllie> @Too_Much_Nukie Ehhh, I guess. But using the Force as a copout for everything gets old real fast.
[2:06:14] <GustauveVIII> @PatStaresAt I don't think you can enter the temple at the end of this cave unless you do the academy first, but I don't remember.
[2:06:17] <Gruhunchously> They look cool though
[2:06:22] <Broken_Sonex> @Too_Much_Nukie They could've made a billion death stars
[2:06:24] <KaitlynnHere> @jjcheeker but he hated the Jedi tho, I think he’d wanted an advantage and not play by their game
[2:06:25] <%Too_Much_Nukie> One-handed lightsabers are only useful for the defense bonus from Duelist.
[2:06:33] <Broken_Sonex> Tell that to Woolie and V
[2:06:33] <rawrmeowxd> I like the lightsaber system in Jedi Knight
[2:06:39] <danielm427> only if you have two hands
[2:06:40] <%Taisuru> Counterpoint, game is easy and Dueling feat exists so you can do it anyway
[2:06:41] <%Too_Much_Nukie> @Broken_Sonex Or fucking planets.
[2:06:43] <%JJCheeker> I would only do one handed if I wanted to make the game harder
[2:06:46] <%Too_Much_Nukie> Galaxies even.
[2:06:47] <Gruhunchously> What if you used the Star Forge to make another Star Forge?
[2:06:49] <$RealThiele> dnd 3.0 had pretty bad melee balance issues
[2:07:02] <%Too_Much_Nukie> @Gruhunchously Spoilers: They did.
[2:07:21] <KaitlynnHere> And hk was all like “Jedi underestimate me and my big gun, it makes my gears hot when I kill them”
[2:07:28] <Meekest> They'll make it real time combat
[2:07:34] <%asgard147> it gonna
[2:07:35] <olaksi> DnD doesn't make much sense as video game system no
[2:07:35] <+FoolsArcade> You mean Star Wars Jedi: Fallen Order?
[2:07:38] <GarbageQueenEllie> No action. Action bad. Moar RPG
[2:07:39] <danielm427> turn base
[2:07:39] <%Daxalog> Bbubut whadabout the ff7 ar?
[2:07:42] <DukeBlack_> either go with xenoblade or FF xiv combat
[2:07:48] <%vehementvadr> but i want kotor fallen order pat
[2:07:54] <%legendscar01> EA isn't making the next star wars game right?
[2:07:54] <%JJCheeker> I still don't mind turn based
[2:07:58] <OldManDeckardCain> they will make it even less of an rpg than cyberpunk LUL
[2:07:58] <Gruhunchously> Oh I see too groups are fighting. Oh well
[2:08:03] <KaitlynnHere> But an action game would mean cutting people and we all know that won’t ha
[2:08:04] <%RetributionP> nope neir jedi
[2:08:06] <monsieurfantastic> platinum presents kotor
[2:08:06] <MegalomaniacalMegalodon> I think we all just agree it's perfectly suited for ALL the thing
[2:08:08] <KaitlynnHere> Happen
[2:08:14] <%Too_Much_Nukie> @legendscar01 They are, but they're not the only company making Star Wars now.
[2:08:23] <%Too_Much_Nukie> And there's a reboot of KOTOR 1 in production that is not EA.
[2:08:25] <KaitlynnHere> Wait, didn’t an action Star Wars game come out recently?
[2:08:30] <%legendscar01> Shit
[2:08:30] <Gruhunchously> No dismemberment!
[2:08:45] <%RetributionP> sith automata
[2:08:49] <%slimmixrp> @patstaresat there's a mask that looks exactly like the sith mask that you can equip. Duros hunter mask or some shit. Idk if its good though
[2:08:50] <+theaceclaw> the big rumor is that its going to be done by aspyr
[2:08:52] <%Too_Much_Nukie> Fallen Order is alright
[2:08:58] <%MassConnect> not even
[2:08:58] <+OneGorillionDollars> Alternatively, kotor but it plays like bayonetta
[2:09:01] <%Too_Much_Nukie> It has a lot of room for improvement.
[2:09:10] <rawrmeowxd> It was cool they got the guy from Shameless for it
[2:09:10] <%vexion_smh> PogChamp
[2:09:15] <%Too_Much_Nukie> The combat feels like it's the devs first attempt at an action game.

[2:24:37] <%GalacticaPhanto> Smoking Ichiban is so good tho
[2:24:40] <Fapbsi> I like the KFConsole

[2:24:45] <%za7az> Welp
[2:24:46] <KaitlynnHere> Welp
[2:24:48] <%justcallmebobplease> Guy casually talked about beating their EX if they goofed like Paige did.

[2:24:55] <+fockniapo> this new animation is the shit
[2:24:57] <%justcallmebobplease> Like, just SUPER casually
[2:24:57] <KaitlynnHere> That was a thing
[2:24:58] <bomfiz> @maenos2 what did they say?
[2:25:03] <Broken_Sonex> ANYWAY BACK TO THE TALKING ABOUT THE KOTOR EMAKE. I heard they're gonna make the remake it make sense with the new lore. No doubt the spirit of the game will be gone.
[2:25:03] <%justcallmebobplease> And Paige instantly caught it, and read it
[2:25:03] <%psidefx> Random dude admitted he'd put hands on his SO if they had banter like Pat and Paige
[2:25:07] <$Quiet__Viking> ew what a shitty BRB screen
[2:25:08] <GarbageQueenEllie> Prolly an ex for a reason ammirite
[2:25:09] <%justcallmebobplease> and the PPs got thrown for a loop.
[2:25:26] <%GalacticaPhanto> @quiet__viking Yeah totally I wonder which nerd made it
[2:25:31] <%maenos2> @bomfiz I'd rather not repeat but essentially "joking" about spousal abuse he would do in pats place
[2:25:41] <%blaccbird914> blaccbird914 gifted a Tier 1 sub to Quiet__Viking! They have given 3 Gift Subs in the channel! 
[2:25:49] <@SoFarFetched> Never be main character.
[2:25:58] <%maenos2> amen
[2:25:58] <%Ipsenscastle> I'm still not tired of this BRB
[2:26:00] <KaitlynnHere> Lesson of the day folks, you can’t force someone to love you
[2:26:01] <%cowardman93> the main character of chatr
[2:26:02] <%Quiet__Viking> @GalacticaPhanto what a lazy SFM animation
[2:26:08] <bomfiz> holy fuck
[2:26:08] <%cowardman93> this BRB is dope
[2:26:13] <%maenos2> I love emlos dance
[2:26:18] <%Cykron> The army doesn't make you an abuser, but unfortunately a lot of abusers bring that mentality into the service with them
[2:26:20] <%psidefx> This song has been in my personal mixes for days now
[2:26:31] <Ultimatefool> The hooker boots bit will never die
[2:26:34] <%Quiet__Viking> @blaccbird914 cool thanks for the gift sub
[2:26:35] <%psidefx> ^
[2:26:36] <Broken_Sonex> @Quiet__Viking Yeah, I preferred the old one :)
[2:26:45] <%blaccbird914> @Quiet__Viking np
[2:27:00] <%GalacticaPhanto> Real talk, good on using the Pop Team Epic reference
[2:27:08] <KaitlynnHere> I like it tho
[2:27:14] <KaitlynnHere> It’s cuuute
[2:27:48] <$ff7regackted> This is goofy :D
[2:27:48] <%maenos2> how much snow did pat get anyway
[2:28:00] <Broken_Sonex> Ehhhhh....it's so-so
[2:28:01] <monsieurfantastic> Paige is going H.A.M on that stage
[2:28:08] <KaitlynnHere> @maenos2 at least 6 feet
[2:28:19] <Zeikier> Crazy Noisy Bizarre Stream
[2:28:27] <$ff7regackted> UK doesnt get decent snow i swear
[2:28:31] <%Quiet__Viking> @GalacticaPhanto thanks I just got back into pop team and asked pat if this would be cool and he said, " thats stupid, do it"
[2:28:37] <$ff7regackted> We get like 2mm if that
[2:28:39] <%maenos2> @kaitlynnhere fucking...seriously?! Jesus Christ wow. I know different climate compared to where j am but jesus...
[2:28:39] <%legendscar01> legendscar01 subscribed at Tier 1. They've subscribed for 28 months! Hey Pat, thoughts on RE4 remake rumors?
[2:28:46] <%AkronymCLT> The North does
[2:28:52] <%AkronymCLT> South not so much
[2:28:58] <%justcallmebobplease> Man though, I've been so happy I've been catching Pat and Paige streams more often recently, more or less JUST in time to catch all the parts of the snowed-in-car silliness. It was like, a multi-day toy-train-car wreck we all got to watch in incredible slow motion.
[2:29:01] <Broken_Sonex> Kinda wish there was a shorter version of the new intro. Seems like it drags a bit.
[2:29:04] <%Ipsenscastle> I love the little side glance Paige does after Pat falls over
[2:29:05] <%GalacticaPhanto> @ff7regackted I love your name so much lol
[2:29:07] <rawrmeowxd> aww dude. He's afk for a bit lol @legendscar01
[2:29:26] <$ff7regackted> @GalacticaPhanto thanks! :D
[2:29:27] <KaitlynnHere> @maenos2 I was kidding, but it’s enough that pat has to dig out the car so... however much that really is I dunno
[2:29:36] <%Arancet> @Quiet__Viking its nice, i would just add a variation besides pat falling every time, like a skele pops up and paige runs off
[2:29:38] <%legendscar01> lol
[2:29:41] <Valentinius_Anodyne> As someone who recently threw their back out shoveling snow because the snow blower was broken, snow looks nice but is maybe a bit overated
[2:29:43] <$ff7regackted> @AkronymCLT yeah that probably explains it :D
[2:29:50] <%maenos2> @kaitlynnhere hah gotcha. more the. we get at least I'm sure.
[2:29:57] <%maenos2> here being like 3 inches
[2:30:12] <KaitlynnHere> @valentinius_anodyne snow is the best when you’re a kid. That’s about it
[2:30:15] <%legendscar01> Wish we had some snow here in texas
[2:30:17] <+alphonseisbest> man anyone here been watchin JP stream FF14 e9s?
[2:30:32] <+alphonseisbest> he just went hard on the background gamers LUL
[2:30:40] <%legendscar01> Don't like this wait animation
[2:30:40] <+alphonseisbest> banning left and right
[2:30:45] <KaitlynnHere> @legendscar01 I’m sure you can find plenty of snow in Texas
[2:30:49] <%cafefunk> Ok so while theres 600 people here, ive been doing a lot of online webdigging into philosophy and came across anti-natalism- does anyone here agree with it? Just curious to get some different perspectives
[2:31:03] <%legendscar01> I wish
[2:31:07] <%Quiet__Viking> @Arancet hmm if I have time after I make the next outro, I could probably do it
[2:31:23] <$ff7regackted> cheer500
[2:31:49] <GarbageQueenEllie> @cafefunk Sounds super weird.

[2:32:40] <GarbageQueenEllie> You can ban whoever you want for any reason. Esp for that reason
[2:32:41] <KaitlynnHere> People who say that just want all the viewers

[2:33:01] <%PaladinDupre> its just not okay to hit people, if you have to defend yourself shoot them
[2:33:02] <%jdhwash> Why does Pat have to tell adults not to hit other people...

[2:33:10] <$SGrim> @PatStaresAt the only acceptable forces to apply to a significant other are leverage and/or thrust. Kreygasm
[2:33:11] <DexteraXIII> It's very easy to not punch people
[2:33:12] <%Too_Much_Nukie> Sounds like 1984.

[2:33:22] <%cowardman93> I work in construction and the amount I hear of people just casually talking about spousal abuse is wild

[2:34:04] <Raven_In_A_Tree> Fuck aliens though earthsupremacy
[2:34:05] <+ciabattabear> anyway it's statistically proven that men who batter their female significant others are more likely to murder them
[2:34:05] <+shallowjam> just move on
[2:34:05] <$SGrim> THE DUTCH THOUGH
[2:34:06] <%Puhff> Oh like you? Kappa
[2:34:07] <Ultimatefool> But the French go oui oui oohlala
[2:34:11] <%legendscar01> So we can make fun of british people
[2:34:13] <Ell1ot> can we discriminate on people that are terrible at video games?
[2:34:15] <%cowardman93> we brits enjoy the jokes so you all carry on
[2:34:15] <revoltingimp> don't shake their fucking hands
[2:34:17] <Ninjer_89> Yup, we do.
[2:34:18] <BerryliciousDefinition> Its chewsday, innit?
[2:34:18] <GarbageQueenEllie> Don't hit people, hit ON people.
[2:34:19] <%Movemeister> We sure do
[2:34:20] <adzy2k6> I mean, if you think the British speak funny, listen to the Canadians, Autralians and Americans
[2:34:21] <%Monkeyweed21> I'm not convinced that British people exist
[2:34:22] <%asgard147> We're trying Pat FeelsBadMan
[2:34:24] <+ciabattabear> it's saturday innit
[2:34:28] <Zeikier> hell yeah pat
[2:34:28] <danielm427> dont shake their hands
[2:34:30] <revoltingimp> what about game journalists?
[2:34:31] <SomersaultJustice> I feel like I missed something
[2:34:32] <%AkronymCLT> We talk like that because it was the fashion at the time
[2:34:36] <Ell1ot> sipsipHellmo
[2:34:36] <%LeiaSkynoober> Love ya, Pat !
[2:34:38] <HeroToxiko> LUL smash community
[2:34:44] <%maenos2> LUL
[2:34:53] <+fockniapo> "smash" community
[2:34:54] <$ggbhtg> Like Aris / AvoidingThePuddle, huh LUL
[2:34:54] <%SirGO0SE> the Aris ban appeal streams are pretty lit tbh
[2:34:55] <@SSaryn> Some of those ban appeals are REALLY FUNNY I'll admit
[2:34:55] <%asgard147> limesLUL
[2:34:58] <Gruhunchously> I feel it's justified to descriminate against games journalists.
[2:35:00] <GustauveVIII> the only fun abuse is the abuse you can give people in video games
[2:35:03] <%a_goth_pancake> I gotta ask because I'm curious; not that I think you'd abuse paige, but is this subject matter at least partially responsible for moving away from angriest pat?
[2:35:06] <%legendscar01> Is Pat God now?
[2:35:09] <wembleyttv> Can you read them out please
[2:35:10] <penitentpendant> My general idea in life: "Only act on others actions, not their origins. They had a choice in one, not the other."
[2:35:12] <+ciabattabear> can I dm you pictures of bears. the animal I mean
[2:35:14] <%DEETRz> i hope he does the ban appeal
[2:35:17] <%justcallmebobplease> GEE I WONDER WHY PAT IS SPECIFYING THAT RIGHT NOW
[2:35:17] <%cowardman93> no let them keep doing the appeals, they're real funny
[2:35:18] <Broken_Sonex> But what if they get off on being banned?
[2:35:19] <HeroToxiko> i love when the appeals actually escalate so they just say the loud part even louder LUL
[2:35:20] <danielm427> what if they stop playing melee
[2:35:22] <OldManDeckardCain> just slide into pat's dms on youe knees LUL
[2:35:22] <+fockniapo> lol, he got mad cause I sent him an angry pat MHW mod for palico on twitter
[2:35:27] <%MidnightBurst12> aww
[2:35:30] <%psidefx> He said PERSONAL enjoyment
[2:35:31] <Gruhunchously> Oof
[2:35:37] <%SirGO0SE> the Aris Ban Appeal streams are what got me to start watching Aris that shit is gold
[2:35:42] <%espanishcanamurciana> if kotor 3 happens there needs to be yoda race companion or riot
[2:35:43] <%za7az> Is there a big enough donation someone could make to be unbanned?
[2:35:44] <%legendscar01> How much money to get unbanned?
[2:35:51] <%RetributionP> nah tweet those messages
[2:35:53] <penitentpendant> The ban gave enough exp for a level
[2:35:57] <%cowardman93> now back to star wars which had no spousal abuse eve- GOD DAMMIT ANAKIN
[2:36:10] <%espanishcanamurciana> psaWink psaWink psaWink
[2:36:10] <wembleyttv> I just like looking up the reason why they get banned for it "Well since you said this"
[2:36:13] <$ggbhtg> The ban gave you IRL EXP
[2:36:14] <%psidefx> Half Mill for unban
[2:36:15] <GarbageQueenEllie> Oh nooo no more Amadamaaa
[2:36:20] <%shurtal> Koto2 says "Show Feats"
[2:36:20] <Ell1ot> that one time you blocked a guy and he switched over to an alt with the same profile picture
[2:36:21] <%legendscar01> oh yeah, anakin does right lol
[2:36:26] <KaitlynnHere> @za7az money doesn’t make someone less of an asshole, it just makes them a rich asshole
[2:36:30] <Gruhunchously> Spousal abuse AND child murder
[2:36:32] <goatlord_> Can you teach Elmo to use the Force?
[2:36:53] <%legendscar01> But Anakin murdered children Pat
[2:37:00] <$ggbhtg> The best part about banning, is that you can go read their chat log and find out "oh wait, they were ALWAYS an asshole" LUL
[2:37:00] <Gruhunchously> Money often grants people more avenues to be an asshole.
[2:37:11] <%jdhwash> DA GIEF
[2:37:15] <$ggbhtg> it's cut and dry so often
[2:37:23] <wembleyttv> But Anakin hates the sand as well
[2:37:28] <$ggbhtg> it's pathetic. hilarious, but pathetic
[2:37:30] <danielm427> ankin only killed the younglings
[2:37:43] <OldManDeckardCain> woolie has a hamburger phone while pat has a hamburger dog
[2:37:48] <GarbageQueenEllie> I hope I'm not an asshole. A dumbass, definitely, but not an asshole.
[2:37:50] <%legendscar01> Only? lol
[2:37:52] <$ggbhtg> Borkocity
[2:37:52] <%Ipsenscastle> fur-ocity
[2:37:57] <Broken_Sonex> With increasing hunger
[2:37:57] <%Monkeyweed21> dont force choke your pregnant wife for no reason
[2:37:57] <KaitlynnHere> I think a lack of empathy grants people more Avenues to being an asshole
[2:38:06] <rawrmeowxd> Glad you're back Pat! How'd the shoveling go? lol
[2:38:10] <$ggbhtg> CERTAINLY
[2:38:12] <%Arancet> cant fit the cat tree behind the couch?
[2:38:12] <%cowardman93> they say pets reflect their owners, just sayin
[2:38:13] <Virokwet> it must
[2:38:15] <penitentpendant> Sounds like something that'd be in DBZA
[2:38:16] <rawrmeowxd> Patent that!
[2:38:17] <%Huntercd> Hahaha
[2:38:19] <%legendscar01> Pat is the smartest thing in that room
[2:38:20] <%asgard147> "You shall not have my tree Pig Dog!" psaPorgmo
[2:38:21] <danielm427> team four star?
[2:38:22] <Valentinius_Anodyne> It's too obvious a pun not to, surely
[2:38:26] <ape_hawk> how cute
[2:38:32] <Raven_In_A_Tree> Ill make it i love rambling DB
[2:38:34] <penitentpendant> Vegeta's Podcast title for a "Grind My Gears" series
[2:38:40] <%AzureGale> @PatStaresAt Giant Bomb has a DBZ podcast called "All Systems Goku"
[2:38:40] <%walternatorz> You should have a segment on your podcast dedicated to coming up with Podcast names.
[2:38:45] <Gruhunchously> Cats are assholes. Cute, but mean.
[2:39:00] <GarbageQueenEllie> So does Treat Injury strengthen Death Field? I feel like it oughta
[2:39:09] <%legendscar01> I love Dogs, hate cats
[2:39:17] <%za7az> @KaitlynnHere Fair enough
[2:39:22] <Gruhunchously> What, were these Sith just chilling in this cave? Or were they following you?
[2:39:24] <adzy2k6> I like how they had to retcon force storm when they made it a common thing for sith in the prequel series. They said that the reason vader never used it was because it hurt his life support sustems
[2:39:50] <%Monkeyweed21> I SAW A TPOSE
[2:39:51] <$ggbhtg> @walternatorz So that Woolie can throw them all out and come up with something different, like always woolieF
[2:39:59] <%MassConnect> cause injury strengths death field
[2:40:06] <%strakillias> It think it does restrict FP
[2:40:12] <Broken_Sonex> @adzy2k6 I mean, he was mostly cyborg so I can let that one go
[2:40:16] <%Too_Much_Nukie> PARTY CAVE
[2:40:18] <+TheShisno> When will we get another BioWare Star Wars game so I can have sex with a Muun
[2:40:24] <Gruhunchously> Most armor restricts force powers
[2:40:34] <%legendscar01> indiana Jones time
[2:40:36] <GarbageQueenEllie> This is one of the best parts in the whole game. Great character analysis
[2:40:43] <adzy2k6> @Broken_Sonex I suppose it was what killed him as well, so it was a very light retcon. Still
[2:40:46] <%Too_Much_Nukie> @Gruhunchously Not in canon it doesn't.
[2:40:49] <%Monkeyweed21> APATHY IS DEATH
[2:40:51] <%psidefx> psaBig blow
[2:40:52] <%AzureGale> That would be some REALLY weird sex
[2:40:54] <%slimmixrp> Force only regens at certain points in this tomb
[2:40:55] <%Too_Much_Nukie> That's purely for the KOTOR games because they're based on DnD
[2:40:59] <%slimmixrp> So be careful with them force powerz
[2:41:03] <+TheShisno> PAIGE HAS ENTERED
[2:41:11] <wembleyttv> Is this a cool tomb or a bad puzzle tomb
[2:41:12] <%Too_Much_Nukie> YEYEYEYEYE
[2:41:15] <Gruhunchously> Enter the party cave
[2:41:19] <%DEETRz> ah the young hot malak
[2:41:21] <OldManDeckardCain> oh hey, it's the loser
[2:41:21] <%Too_Much_Nukie> Time for dialogue boss battles.
[2:41:24] <KaitlynnHere> Paige boots are here
[2:41:25] <%psidefx> Bastila?
[2:41:28] <@commanderclaw> Chill malak is so weird
[2:41:31] <KaitlynnHere> Boots n boobs
[2:41:32] <Gruhunchously> No real loot in here, just some excellant writing.
[2:41:33] <adzy2k6> Was that Bastila?
[2:41:36] <GarbageQueenEllie> Everytime Bastila is on screen, I turn into a thirsty idiot
[2:41:45] <Broken_Sonex> AANG?!
[2:41:45] <adzy2k6> ah, it is her
[2:41:47] <%Too_Much_Nukie> Fun Fact: Malak's original name was Alek before he became a darth.
[2:41:50] <%legendscar01> Execute order 66
[2:41:52] <Broken_Sonex> THE AVATAR?!
[2:42:02] <%Huntercd> Sexy Bastila luxxP luxxGasm
[2:42:06] <%Too_Much_Nukie> This makes Malak/Alek the dumbest mother fucker in space.
[2:42:09] <$ff7regackted> AANG!?
[2:42:11] <+TheShisno> He is the Force Avatar
[2:42:12] <$ff7regackted> why?
[2:42:13] <Raven_In_A_Tree> Off topic question but as someone interested in FF14 should i wait for the ps5 beta or just jump in?
[2:42:16] <Gruhunchously> I'm so glad I made the Malak=Aang connection back in 2006
[2:42:16] <%SaiyanShoto> Hey it’s Malak with a lower jaw
[2:42:34] <GarbageQueenEllie> Alek was always a Himbo, this is Fact.
[2:42:35] <%cowardman93> @Raven_In_A_Tree jump in dude
[2:42:36] <$ff7regackted> The last force bender
[2:42:42] <%Alazull> Malek is protecting his neck
[2:42:49] <Caleboverton> is that Quan Chi the jedi?
[2:42:49] <%wibbwobbler> LUL
[2:42:49] <+TheShisno> Malek with teeth
[2:42:56] <adzy2k6> So, he had sith tatoos while he was a jedi?
[2:43:04] <%Huntercd> Why is he talking so much?
[2:43:04] <Broken_Sonex> Oh my God Malak is just a Dude Bro Aang.
[2:43:16] <%saiyanblitz> Sup everybody
[2:43:25] <%legendscar01> Always join the dark side people
[2:43:29] <%Huntercd> He could have said this in like two minutes
[2:43:43] <owazowski> Oh no he's hot!
[2:43:47] <%walternatorz> it sounds like your house is falling apart
[2:43:52] <%xMaSterKeef420bluntNinjAx> Truuu
[2:43:54] <rawrmeowxd> His might is too powerful
[2:44:01] <%psidefx> My Zangief is getting big he too powerful
[2:44:13] <GarbageQueenEllie> I love the idea of really getting into your character's motivations and questioning themselves.
[2:44:22] <%legendscar01> This is kinda boring
[2:44:29] <%SirGO0SE> wus dat smel
[2:44:33] <%psidefx> Its BLUUDD
[2:44:35] <%dekkitout> WHAT'S THAT SMELL?
[2:44:38] <%Too_Much_Nukie> Pat is playing it in a boring way lol
[2:44:39] <rawrmeowxd> What's that smell...??? ITS BLOOD
[2:44:39] <Broken_Sonex> I'm looking at Bastila and holy shit the asses on these female models.
[2:44:42] <Caleboverton> BLUUUDD
[2:44:43] <%Too_Much_Nukie> This is about picking the exile's past.
[2:45:24] <%AncelDeLambert> "She decided to agree with us... after we brutally brainwashed her
[2:45:27] <%Too_Much_Nukie> WHO COULD HE BE TALKING ABOUT?!
[2:45:29] <%legendscar01> lol
[2:45:45] <Gruhunchously> I love when this thing happens in RPGs? When you get to justify your characters actions.
[2:45:49] <%legendscar01> WTF
[2:45:50] <%Huntercd> Didn't she join because she was horny?
[2:45:53] <scorpio990> atpRtsd
[2:46:00] <Valentinius_Anodyne> The lesson begins no- BZZT
[2:46:01] <%Too_Much_Nukie> Pat is gonna run out of force points and it's going to be hilarious.
[2:46:17] <Broken_Sonex> @Huntercd Yes.
[2:46:24] <Gruhunchously> The funny thing is, if you lose this fight, you get MORE Dark Side points
[2:46:26] <rawrmeowxd> big spooky
[2:46:30] <%Too_Much_Nukie> Your force points don't regen in the party cave.
[2:46:42] <saraizarai> Ah, the true enemy of Kotor, bugs and glitches
[2:46:44] <%Arweynn> Isn't that only for lightside?
[2:46:52] <%slimmixrp> Yeah only at certain points
[2:46:53] <Gruhunchously> Also, if you're light side, your Force Points don't regenerate in this cave.
[2:46:53] <%Too_Much_Nukie> Is it?
[2:47:01] <%Ghufufin> yay murder
[2:47:07] <%Too_Much_Nukie> I never knew that was only light side, that's wild.
[2:47:08] <@commanderclaw> Only for lightsiders
[2:47:13] <%slimmixrp> For light side
[2:47:14] <Gruhunchously> You broke him
[2:47:14] <%Too_Much_Nukie> This whole section will be so easy then tho
[2:47:23] <%Agami23> technically thats not wrong if its fully charged
[2:47:23] <rawrmeowxd> haha noobs
[2:47:24] <Broken_Sonex> YEAH FUCK YOU WOOLIE
[2:47:26] <Gruhunchously> If you're dark side, they regen super fast
[2:47:34] <%Arweynn> yeah grinding to 50 was... fun as lightside
[2:47:35] <%Monkeyweed21> but Light Later tho
[2:47:35] <Aydarkzero> LUL
[2:47:49] <%cervidaequus> The brb screen shouting “RELOAD!”
[2:47:55] <Aydarkzero> could you ever be a Grey Jedi in this?
[2:48:02] <%Arweynn> especially when it glitched out and Deathfield and ForceDrain just hard stopped woring for me
[2:48:18] <Gruhunchously> @Aydarkzero You can, but there isn't really any point
[2:48:18] <Broken_Sonex> @Monkeyweed21 Nah, It's Dark Now time.
[2:48:37] <saraizarai> @Aydarkzero You can't enter this area if you're grey

[2:53:21] <TheGerudoKin> @BigDumBeak A russian dude came in and said he was a wife beater and when he was banned he said "but everyone does it"
[2:53:22] <%Alazull> Wow, that bad?

[2:53:57] <xcompleasedad> Here's some general morality: Don't physically abuse people. Amazing.
[2:53:59] <%SirGO0SE> if you guys were liberal with bans i'd have been gone a long time ago :)
[2:53:59] <%Monkeyweed21> you could make a stream out of reading ban appeals
[2:54:02] <ape_hawk> like, i troll and shitpost, but nothing near that bad
[2:54:02] <moonmintparadise> Hey Pat, I know a lot of Russian people and they are not horrible people. Fuck that guy lmao
[2:54:03] <generalve> Timeouts for for moran's. Bans are for pieces of shit assholes
[2:54:07] <%AncelDeLambert> LUL
[2:54:08] <pennykettle_> Ban appeals are either calling you slurs or saying "bro I've changed" after saying slurs a week ago
[2:54:10] <@commanderclaw> Paige thirsts for blood
[2:54:12] <%AncelDeLambert> BAN NUKE!

[2:54:20] <%legendscar01> Why does pat attract these people?
[2:54:22] <rawrmeowxd> Like I troll around on here sometimes but there's a line. That dude was just a jackass
[2:54:24] <%super_ej8> The ban purge starts NOW!

[2:54:45] <+JustToWatch> Ban everyone who asks a question
[2:54:47] <%SvenHolgersson> YEYEYEEYEYEYEYEYEY
[2:54:48] <Gruhunchously> It's PTSD flashback time.
[2:54:49] <Broken_Sonex> @PatStaresAt I don't think he was trying to make an appeal. I think he just wanted to make you feel uncomfortable.
[2:54:51] <%SirGO0SE> I hope they get better though
[2:54:53] <KaitlynnHere> Oh I loved that one
[2:54:54] <%AncelDeLambert> "my life is over and my day is ruined"
[2:54:59] <Sunstalker> Just log out and you can see the tweets DansGame
[2:55:05] <+Gallhint> I'm glad you take genuine appeals into consideration patto

[2:55:07] <xcompleasedad> @KaitlynnHere Punching people is BAD.
[2:55:10] <CrypticMochi> Ah okay, some just need a nice day out
[2:55:11] <@commanderclaw> Social media helps me hate myself less because I realize I'm not the bottom of the barrel
[2:55:14] <%RetroCop87> can't wait to see them complain on Woolie's stream
[2:55:18] <DexteraXIII> Dat parasocial relationship

[2:55:52] <Broken_Sonex> @RetroCop87 Woolie keeps them around?!
[2:55:52] <@commanderclaw> BLOOD FOR THE BLOOD GOD
[2:55:53] <Valentinius_Anodyne> Like, the only thing I can imagine doing in a ban appeal is apologizing for being enough of an asshole to get banned, I genuinely cannot imagine doubling-down on justifying myself
[2:55:53] <%justcallmebobplease> That sort of blubbering is indicative that that's their go-to 'UNDO GOOF' method. Casually be asshole, go all-in on crying to be un-declared an asshole.
[2:56:00] <%super_ej8> more blood for the BLOOD GOD!
[2:56:00] <%Arweynn> THAT SMELL

[2:56:44] <%GalacticaPhanto> oh. that's brutal
[2:56:45] <%TheDeceasedJester> Use the soviet method. Never retreat and who does it just accuse them for treason and just kill them
[2:56:45] <%Pappajimbo> thats some 40k imperial army shit
[2:56:45] <%espanishcanamurciana> Now thats a Russian tactic, well done general

[2:56:48] <adzy2k6> What would palpatine do?
[2:56:49] <KaitlynnHere> Literal blaster fodder
[2:57:01] <moonmintparadise> Pat has turned into a 40K Commisar
[2:57:01] <+JustToWatch> and then they all vanished
[2:57:05] <%cafefunk> Thats so messed up
[2:57:09] <%za7az> LUL
[2:57:14] <penitentpendant> Cartoon Villainy!
[2:57:14] <Aydarkzero> Karen of the Darkside
[2:57:20] <%DakotaMacDoodle> young Palpatine
[2:57:20] <%goose_attack_almanac> Make them cross the mine bridge so that you don't have to step over that pile of dirt
[2:57:21] <saraizarai> Darth Maul?
[2:57:22] <+Gespens> Isn't that just Palpatine that you're wanting?
[2:57:23] <%RetroCop87> @PatStaresAt you mean Grievous?
[2:57:24] <%Too_Much_Nukie> I mean, that's Palpatine.
[2:57:26] <KaitlynnHere> Whose a dick?
[2:57:30] <%Too_Much_Nukie> That's why Palpatine is the best.
[2:57:31] <Aydarkzero> need more of that kind of villains honestly
[2:57:31] <BinaryShuffle> Palpatine?
[2:57:32] <Gruhunchously> Azula
[2:57:35] <Valentinius_Anodyne> That's kinda Palpatine
[2:57:36] <KaitlynnHere> Like that one guy you’d just banned?
[2:57:40] <SmolBluGhost> so cartoony its scary?
[2:57:40] <Broken_Sonex> Just someone that evil and they love it and will always double down
[2:57:41] <%seanaramicus> You mean Sidious?
[2:57:44] <%justcallmebobplease> Another Palpatine, then
[2:57:48] <xcompleasedad> Stealth LUL
[2:57:49] <+loukemia83> What? A Puppy Orphanage is on top of the Jedi Temple? DESTROY IT!
[2:57:50] <@commanderclaw> Unless you watch those cartoons for children
[2:57:51] <%its_just_coach> grevis had a bitch cough the whole time
[2:57:52] <saraizarai> Right there's nothing redeaming about palpatine
[2:58:04] <adzy2k6> Grevous would have been good with more time in the films. They assumed everyone was going to watch the cartoons
[2:58:06] <Aydarkzero> yeah evil
[2:58:07] <Broken_Sonex> I AM ALL OF DA SEEIFFFF
[2:58:10] <%cowardman93> he's so cartoonishly evil and I love it

[2:58:10] <%RetroCop87> he spins through the air like a propeller, it's amazing
[2:58:11] <%TheDeceasedJester> Soldiers of the republic charge or i call for your manager
[2:58:11] <EldritchNeko> they will give birth just to kill their baby because killing babys upsets people and only for that reason
[2:58:12] <%Monkeyweed21> hes just yucking it up
[2:58:18] <Gruhunchously> He's having such a great time being evil and it's fun to watch.
[2:58:19] <generalve> I DONT GIVE A FUCK - sidious
[2:58:24] <Valentinius_Anodyne> He's evil and loving it
[2:58:26] <rawrmeowxd> The biggest evil
[2:58:26] <%goose_attack_almanac> Darth Maul in the Clone Wars cartoon was pretty evil. The first thing he did was go to an innocent planet on the outer rim just to kill people to lure Kenobi
[2:58:27] <%kastev> RLM is just super right about everything
[2:58:28] <%W1nterTitan> He just LOVES being evil
[2:58:29] <wembleyttv> Adachi would make a kick ass sith
[2:58:30] <qu3kl41n_the_impure_king> Yea, that makes sense
[2:58:30] <Fapbsi> oh already back. What did I miss?
[2:58:35] <Gruhunchously> Pat agrees with Mike from RLM? STOP THE PRESS!
[2:58:39] <danielm427> so RE villain
[2:58:42] <+Gespens> Remember, that Palpatine used the force to impreganatene Anakin's mother
[2:58:43] <Aydarkzero> lmao
[2:58:44] <%Ynkubus_> Grevious in Genndys clone wars is scary, in 3d hes just ep 3 but stretched out

[2:58:58] <+welly_____> Hi all
[2:59:04] <%wibbwobbler> LUL
[2:59:06] <@commanderclaw> Giving classically trained actors a villain role and letting them chew the scenery is always a good time
[2:59:07] <%AncelDeLambert> fuck, I gotta rewatch all of them now
[2:59:08] <+welly_____> Is RLM still making vids??
[2:59:12] <%Dakuu75> Man, that's a GOOD, fucking, line! lmao

[2:59:22] <wembleyttv> It is
[2:59:23] <%walternatorz> nope
[2:59:25] <Gruhunchously> Star War is garbage but I still like it.
[2:59:25] <@commanderclaw> It can be fun garbage sometimes though
[2:59:26] <Aydarkzero> it's why i watch bits of it
[2:59:26] <%kastev> @welly_____ They put a new Best of the Worst out a few days ago
[2:59:29] <GustauveVIII> @PatStaresAt When you meet your party members at the end of this place, stay neutral for the most interesting outcome

[2:59:37] <%cafefunk> (Sigh) yeah....l
[2:59:37] <adzy2k6> Star wars is the classic mismanagement of a franchise after the initial trilogy

[3:06:55] <Parapattern> Lil doggy thoughts

[3:07:16] <BurningWigEmissary> did grievous have a dick
[3:07:17] <adzy2k6> That seems to be what happens. They tested it by having a guy wear a sweater to work and his wife brought it home during lunch. Because that boosted his smell, the dog got really confused when he got home "early"
[3:07:22] <EldritchNeko> use the force to punch holes in the atmosphere.

[3:09:14] <%Too_Much_Nukie> Pat will most likely hate Nioh 2 though, it still has the same loot system.

[3:20:23] <%doc_ock_rokc> you went dark side. Light side is the one that gest tons of wisdom
[3:20:34] <Gruhunchously> That's the spirit.
[3:20:39] <%legendscar01> Like Anakin DId
[3:20:40] <Aydarkzero> but Darth Vader said one saber is enough
[3:20:48] <BurningWigEmissary> is there a light sabre spear
[3:20:49] <Aydarkzero> yeah he got his ass beat LUL
[3:20:51] <%cowardman93> no he doesn't
[3:20:52] <%dekkitout> Clone Wars Anakin dual wielded like once
[3:20:52] <moosemonkey397> obi wan does it in ep1
[3:20:54] <%Monkeyweed21> Count Dooku had 2 didnt he
[3:20:54] <rawrmeowxd> Yea it's pretty bs lol
[3:20:55] <GarbageQueenEllie> B/c Anakin is a little bitch
[3:20:57] <%Nekros4442> Ahsoka used double sabers throughout Clone Wars at least?
[3:20:57] <Zeif00> Duallllll Weeeeeild
[3:21:00] <MegalomaniacalMegalodon> and then that one second execution of Dooku in 3
[3:21:00] <+rainlily1245> @PatStaresAt You forget Mace Windu just charging Jango and then cutting his head off within five seconds
[3:21:01] <EldritchNeko> could you just use like 20 with the force?
[3:21:01] <@commanderclaw> Shame you won't watch Clone wars then
[3:21:03] <Gruhunchously> Light Saber Naginata
[3:21:04] <+Gespens> Ahsoka turns into a decent character eventually so you got her at least
[3:21:04] <moosemonkey397> when he beast modes darth maul
[3:21:04] <%cowardman93> he beats Dooku Pat
[3:21:07] <%goose_attack_almanac> Ahsoka is pretty cool
[3:21:07] <%cowardman93> you're so wrong
[3:21:11] <%goose_attack_almanac> so is Aayla Secura
[3:21:14] <GustauveVIII> does that mean you liked force unleashed cuz of dual lightsabers MC?
[3:21:14] <%W1nterTitan> and you
[3:21:19] <+SensuiTomo> so what planets we got left?
[3:21:19] <+projectmanatees> but didnt kriea say that all the lightsaber users now are babys compared to the old lords?
[3:21:20] <%Nekros4442> Dooku specifically does not use 2 sabers cus he uses a weird fencing style
[3:21:22] <%Jhylla81> Be General Grievious and use 4
[3:21:23] <%Alazull> Korriban is a shit planet
[3:21:24] <%legendscar01> The Guy who murdered children pat?
[3:21:24] <%dekkitout> If you want Chadakin, watch Clone Wars
[3:21:26] <%Deano8817> @cowardman93 wrong episode LUL
[3:21:27] <adzy2k6> @PatStaresAt It's cool, but real life has show it to be really ineffective unless you are Miyamoto Musashi (who won because he drove his opponents to blind rage before fighting them)
[3:21:29] <%Alazull> Main export, evil
[3:21:31] <Noogiez> didnt grievous have 4 lightsabers?
[3:21:34] <%kastev> Jedi Academy you can get 2 Lightsabers
[3:21:37] <Aydarkzero> oh the reverse grip?
[3:21:39] <%wibbwobbler> lol
[3:21:46] <+Dova573> The first one played well
[3:21:48] <Aydarkzero> thought you would have liked that LUL
[3:21:49] <%gksnipa> you must hate ahsoka then
[3:21:49] <%legendscar01> Grievous sucks ass in the movie

[3:21:52] <Thalchampz> reverse grip is raw
[3:21:53] <olaksi> just chilling
[3:21:53] <%SvenHolgersson> But he is an asshole
[3:21:54] <%Alazull> Ayyy, it's dat boi
[3:21:54] <%Deano8817> DARTH KUZE
[3:21:56] <%SvenHolgersson> So it works out
[3:21:56] <%Agami23> @Noogiez he had like 20. but he used 4 at a time
[3:21:57] <MegalomaniacalMegalodon> there's the asshole with the two double blades in Clone Wars right?
[3:21:57] <rawrmeowxd> I like Jedi Acedmy personally
[3:21:58] <GustauveVIII> i think one hand reverse grip other hand normal grip would be best
[3:22:00] <%GalacticaPhanto> @nekros4442 Because Christopher Lee was an absolute badass
[3:22:01] <%Huntercd> Wasn't there a red Twilek sith? When do we get her?
[3:22:03] <%shurtal> it's Darth Burnt Chikki Tendie
[3:22:04] <%cowardman93> @Deano8817 fuck he did do it in episiode 2 didn't he?
[3:22:07] <wembleyttv> The force unleashed 1 is good the 2nd game is meh
[3:22:07] <+BigDumBeak> he looks like me forgetting to use lotion ha ha
[3:22:13] <pedrinoj> pat did you watch rebels?
[3:22:17] <%Jhylla81> Beef Jerky sith
[3:22:19] <%DakotaMacDoodle> Probably held them like that to prevent clipping and because its edgy
[3:22:21] <%espanishcanamurciana> imagine having invisible ninja body guards
[3:22:21] <%dekkitout> @MegalomaniacalMegalodon Pong Krell, hugest gaping asshole
[3:22:24] <Ras_Aku> Mastery of one blade is better than being good with two
[3:22:25] <Gruhunchously> The Simp Lord
[3:22:25] <+PenmanLupine> dark side goats?
[3:22:34] <Noogiez> double dual wield
[3:22:36] <%RetroCop87> Shadows of the Empire is a great shoot 'em up still
[3:22:52] <%Deano8817> @Deano8817 Yeah, but episode 2 is boring forgettable trash so it makes sense to forget
[3:22:56] <Aydarkzero> guess not
[3:22:58] <rawrmeowxd> It's just like the movies! With the goats!
[3:23:07] <Fapbsi> they arespaceninjas that can turn invisible
[3:23:08] <moonmintparadise> well they sure seem to die really fast so I will assume yes
[3:23:09] <%Alazull> I mean technically none of them are Sith
[3:23:22] <%legendscar01> Everybody loves Jar Jar though
[3:23:24] <%RetroCop87> THIS IS WHERE CARTH KILLED HIS KID
[3:23:25] <Aydarkzero> Gun!
[3:23:35] <%Too_Much_Nukie> In legends, the sith didn't use lightsabers until they met the jedi.
[3:23:39] <Broken_Sonex> @RetroCop87 OH YEAH IT IS
[3:24:13] <Gruhunchously> This whole area freaked me the hell out when I first played it.

[3:24:40] <+projectmanatees> Hated how in kotor 1 everyone didnt wana duel
[3:24:58] <Gruhunchously> You will not harm him. YOU WILL NOT HARM HIM EVER AGAIN
[3:25:01] <Aydarkzero> it's the worst
[3:25:05] <%Alazull> Yeah, you can thank Bioware for making the Sith cooler with the Code, then making them a little lamer by being like, "Well, no there's a Sith race out in secret space!"
[3:25:21] <+lewd_sister_of_battle> wait, whats up with Monster hunter?
[3:25:22] <+PenmanLupine> can't wait for games to figure out fabrics
[3:25:37] <MegalomaniacalMegalodon> Clipping is why I can't play Au Ra, Hrothgar, and Miqote in FFXIV
[3:25:46] <MegalomaniacalMegalodon> tail clipping is so annoying
[3:25:47] <Aydarkzero> @lewd_sister_of_battle when stuff clips through clothes

[3:28:48] <%Daxalog> He discussed each question thoroughly
[3:28:59] <SuperChumps> I do
[3:29:00] <+projectmanatees> did pat get the paradox question right?
[3:29:02] <%Too_Much_Nukie> I know the answers, and there is no library
[3:29:09] <GarbageQueenEllie> Korriban's really gone to the dogs. Good thing next year I'll be transferred to PIGFARTS.
[3:29:16] <wembleyttv> Cheating on tests in video games :O
[3:29:17] <saraizarai> I suppose I can google it
[3:29:20] <adzy2k6> @Gruhunchously That was basically a buzfeed quiz.
[3:29:21] <%Too_Much_Nukie> The place is in ruins pat

[3:29:25] <waywardhavoc> i think the library is just a torture chamber here
[3:29:28] <%SaiyanShoto> Teacher said we’re not supposed to cheat
[3:29:30] <adzy2k6> @Gruhunchously I've always hated how these games to "exams"
[3:29:40] <saraizarai> @wembleyttv This is a sith test, you are supposed to cheat
[3:29:44] <%fredbet96> telling you what answers you got wrong doesn't sound very sith like
[3:29:45] <Aydarkzero> the sith wouldn't tell lies would they
[3:29:50] <%MassConnect> the library is a lie. there is only cheating. through cheating I gain grades
[3:29:58] <%DEETRz> 20
[3:29:59] <descartesfajitabuoy> I was gonna cheat but im not assposed to :(

[3:30:03] <%SvenHolgersson> Darth Karen
[3:30:08] <Gruhunchously> Wouldn't the true Sith way be to torture the answers out of another student?
[3:30:12] <%Too_Much_Nukie> Nadd, 20, Gizka, I always lie, Passion-strength-power-victory
[3:30:12] <wembleyttv> @saraizarai true, you get extra points for it LUL

[3:30:45] <waywardhavoc> well done now you move up to the rank of sith master's peon
[3:30:45] <%Too_Much_Nukie> You did it! With no help from chat
[3:31:03] <$Tuskor13> not even HALF a help
[3:31:05] <%dekkitout> Not even three help?
[3:31:12] <Sapphire_Breeze> 0.9 help was used
[3:31:12] <skyentombment> Wow, pat's such a good video GAMMER
[3:31:13] <Gruhunchously> These guys actually do scale to your level, but you're so broken at this point it doesn't even matter.
[3:31:13] <%goose_attack_almanac> the Sith way
[3:31:13] <%walternatorz> I never thought Pat could be this smart.
[3:31:14] <%Too_Much_Nukie> Now if you were me you'd just remember to press the number keys on the keyboard and not even read the test.
[3:31:16] <AMUSERNAME> 20: 9 people between 6th and 16th, times two halves of the circle, plus the two sith masters named.
[3:31:16] <%goose_attack_almanac> Cheating
[3:31:23] <%Ranryu692> oh cool, I made it before the end of the stream
[3:31:25] <+NotMrDiddles> is that skeleton ok
[3:31:31] <%SvenHolgersson> Maybe next year Pat can sit at the big boy table
[3:31:35] <%SvenHolgersson> I'm so proud
[3:31:37] <Valentinius_Anodyne> If history was worth learning then how they're dead and I'm still around B)
[3:31:39] <%Alazull> Man fuck belts
[3:31:40] <%RetroCop87> that skeleton is Carth's son
[3:31:49] <ape_hawk> as soon as ff14 announces no more belts, he gets a bunch of belts in kotor2
[3:31:51] <%Too_Much_Nukie> Yeah enemies scale to your level but because their attributes don't raise and because they don't gain new feats, you quickly overpower them.
[3:32:22] <Thalchampz> FUCK BELTS
[3:32:26] <+projectmanatees> no more belts banyaPog
[3:32:27] <%doc_ock_rokc> apathy is death
[3:32:28] <$Tuskor13> all my homies hate belts
[3:32:30] <+alphonseisbest> THE END OF THE ERA OF BELTS
[3:32:31] <%Wallabri> NO MORE BELTS YEEAAAHHH
[3:32:32] <%GalacticaPhanto> yeaaaaaaah

[3:32:38] <%Agami23> pat did you see the screen shot for the nier raid they showed? thats the exact shit you mean
[3:32:39] <+corrosivePaladin> no more 4 stam 4 dex belt?
[3:32:39] <%ChrisPlaysThing> ChrisPlaysThing subscribed at Tier 1. They've subscribed for 28 months, currently on a 22 month streak! Time go brrrr
[3:32:40] <+alphonseisbest> FUCK BELTS
[3:32:46] <+projectmanatees> i wonder if they will increase tome prices of gear since we will buy one less
[3:32:47] <%Too_Much_Nukie> This is the door btw
[3:32:52] <+alphonseisbest> Belts can suck my DIC
[3:32:53] <%Too_Much_Nukie> The only thing behind it is lore.
[3:32:54] <%MassConnect> Lulu took all the belts?
[3:33:08] <+Badendchan> I demand a tomestone refund for every belt I've ever bought
[3:33:15] <adzy2k6> Where on earth is Pats health bar in these fights? I always feel like he's taking much more damage than he seems to think he is
[3:33:16] <%Too_Much_Nukie> Orange rhymes with Palpatine
[3:33:29] <%Too_Much_Nukie> Mandalorian Ripper is a really good gun.
[3:33:33] <%Wallabri> i hope they add a bunch of belts to the calamity scavenger's model
[3:33:38] <adzy2k6> damnit
[3:33:42] <+mongorific> i rocked an orange double bladed on my last lord. orange is pretty
[3:33:44] <Gruhunchously> If you have G0-T0 with you he has a really funny line where you ask him to float up and go through that entrance at the top, and he says that he's too big to fit.
[3:33:46] <SuperChumps> Purple is best crystal.
[3:33:47] <+alphonseisbest> I wanna watch every belt get deleted off the Code LUL
[3:33:49] <ape_hawk> your butthole?
[3:33:53] <ape_hawk> oh, chat, right
[3:34:08] <Profmcstevie> There is no good place for cams in this game, there's HUD on every corner LUL
[3:34:28] <waywardhavoc> the floor is stinky there be careful
[3:34:34] <adzy2k6> Surely the best place for the camera would be under the stiff in the top right>
[3:34:40] <ape_hawk> why is the earth farting at you? are you at a con?
[3:34:43] <adzy2k6> stuff*
[3:34:49] <%AzureGale> Who keeps farting out of the floor
[3:34:50] <%Alazull> I am doing fun yes
[3:34:58] <%Too_Much_Nukie> I found it crazy that the newest Tomb Raider game has an option that puts a border on the game specifically so you have a place to put your stream overlay.
[3:34:59] <waywardhavoc> someone rubbed their ass on the floor and the sith magic turned it into a weapon of death
[3:35:02] <+alphonseisbest> JUNES?
[3:35:04] <+BigDumBeak> melee players under the floor boards
[3:35:07] <%RetroCop87> Nanako asking her big bro if they can go to Staw War
[3:35:11] <danielm427> everyday is great at your junes
[3:35:22] <%GarbageNirvana> Since we're on the subject of FFXIV, if I got a Garlond Ironworks logo tattoo on one arm and a Circle of Knowing tattoo on the other how insufferable would that make me look
[3:35:24] <+alphonseisbest> yo anyone here remeber when Nanako ask u about death? LUL
[3:35:38] <adzy2k6> @Too_Much_Nukie Why would you use that? It would reduce what you see as a streamer while you play the game.
[3:35:38] <KaitlynnHere> I’m back what did I miss?
[3:35:39] <faithless_zealot> Is it just me or does the Sith living quarter area on the map kinda shaped like a swastika?
[3:35:57] <KaitlynnHere> @alphonseisbest or she asks you what a blood relative is...
[3:35:58] <$RealThiele> mercy kill
[3:36:00] <%Alazull> Guess we gotta put em down
[3:36:05] <Gruhunchously> TO SLOW
[3:36:10] <Gruhunchously> TOO SLOW
[3:36:18] <$Tuskor13> vote darth pat for galactic goat healthcare
[3:36:22] <KaitlynnHere> And then she’s like “my dad is my blood relative but he doesn’t act like my dad” breaks my heart
[3:36:43] <%Too_Much_Nukie> You can't beat the timer.
[3:36:49] <%Huntercd> spankings for naughty students
[3:36:52] <sharpened_hammer> I think the implication is that it's been years and years.
[3:36:56] <ape_hawk> is it the fun kind of disciplinary action?
[3:36:59] <+alphonseisbest> @GarbageNirvana Very but also i would fuck u based on those tats alone LUL
[3:37:01] <+fetrigon> kinky
[3:37:01] <+projectmanatees> Hated how in kotor 1 half the sith on this planet would try and fight you, but always back down when you say go
[3:37:02] <Gruhunchously> You could have said something there, Visas
[3:37:03] <ape_hawk> or the slightly-less fun kind?
[3:37:16] <%Dunmarkh> LUL
[3:37:18] <%Huntercd> What a waste of a sexy lady
[3:37:24] <Gruhunchously> Blood? In my Star Wars?
[3:37:24] <+alphonseisbest> @KaitlynnHere FUCK i forgot about that one. right in the heart
[3:37:25] <Broken_Sonex> So apparently she was supposed to be cool, but they killed her off because i dunno.
[3:37:28] <KaitlynnHere> Or that other time nanako comes out of her room complaining about having stomach pain and Dojima is like “oh look at the time I gotta go bye!”
[3:37:40] <Fapbsi> "cunning enough to capture me" Yes...the giant cage looks very smart
[3:37:42] <+OmegaWeltall> duh duh duh dhuuuuuu duhduh!
[3:37:49] <%Alazull> Guess she didn't keep those wits
[3:37:57] <KaitlynnHere> @alphonseisbest I’m in the middle of playing it so it’s all fresh in my memory
[3:38:04] <%GarbageNirvana> @alphonseisbest Well I guess that's a net positive
[3:38:06] <Gruhunchously> You were supposed to have a conversation with her at some point but, like so many other things it was cut.
[3:38:09] <%Too_Much_Nukie> Fun fact: This jedi was originally on a different planet. And you'd find the star charts for that planet, along with clues that the jedi is there, here on Korriban.
[3:38:25] <%Bluwizard21> so was paige gonna stream after this?
[3:38:32] <+PenmanLupine> you'll be fine

[3:39:52] <Gruhunchously> Angry Scottish Sith Lord
[3:40:10] <+absolutenc> kick his butt!!!
[3:40:13] <%Too_Much_Nukie> Fun Fact: Sion's design in this game is a result of technological limitations. He's supposed to be literally held together by the force in a more visible way. With bits of free-floating bone and muscle orbiting him.
[3:40:16] <HotMafia81> LOOKIT THEM NIPPIES
[3:40:26] <%Too_Much_Nukie> They couldn't get it to work with the technology at the time.
[3:40:30] <KaitlynnHere> Ya know what would’ve been even grosser? And way more likely.. if there were flies constantly swarming him and maggots crawling on his skin
[3:40:38] <Fapbsi> mr. never die

[3:43:17] <%MassConnect> sincere question, if we "love" the game why do we HATE having to replay it when we lose progress?

[3:52:11] <%YakumoYomi> Gawrsh
[3:52:11] <Gruhunchously> I wonder if you can pass the test this time
[3:52:12] <%its_just_coach> but pat what if you saved
[3:52:13] <+absolutenc> just to be sure
[3:52:14] <%Avalon_One> Save after every action, it's the only way to be sure
[3:52:15] <penitentpendant> As a person with terrible typing speed, apologies for the annoyance~
[3:52:19] <KaitlynnHere> No but really
[3:52:22] <%Alazull> It was pretty dank
[3:52:23] <+saltytyrz> Do it gooder. Duh
[3:52:24] <%weissguard> UI Goofy is to good for this world
[3:52:24] <%Monkeyweed21> like fucking die?
[3:52:26] <%vexion_smh> Remember when goofy FUCKED
[3:52:26] <scrublordsamurai> remember that time goofy died in KH
[3:52:30] <KaitlynnHere> What
[3:52:31] <%Alazull> Sora was all like, "Goofy no!"
[3:52:32] <%Ranryu692> ROFL
[3:52:34] <Sapphire_Breeze> reminder that Goofy is the smartest character in that franchise
[3:52:40] <%AzureGale> LUL LUL LUL LUL LUL
[3:52:41] <+projectmanatees> remember when donald used zetaflare
[3:52:41] <%its_just_coach> remember when goofy fucking died
[3:52:41] <%cowardman93> remember when Donald fucking murdered someone in Kingdom Hearts
[3:52:41] <KaitlynnHere> @monkeyweed21 lmao yea that was the best part
[3:52:43] <%psidefx> It was the cute
[3:52:43] <%DEETRz> remember goofy's wife was cheating on him with the milkman
[3:52:43] <Goodvibes99508> I want to see it give me a hint here
[3:52:45] <commanderapathy> it is impossible to explain the kh story
[3:52:47] <Gruhunchously> You know what else is annoying? Having to do the entire level again because you didn't save.
[3:52:52] <%linSP> son, let me tell you the story about donald and sephiroth
[3:52:54] <nevan_44> LUL
[3:52:58] <olaksi> is the second half of KH2 just a dream of goofy's fading conscious?
[3:53:03] <%SaiyanShoto> Seriously though I’ve been wanting Max in KH since I was a teenager
[3:53:05] <%Monkeyweed21> Donald Duck is stronger than Bahamut
[3:53:09] <%Avalon_One> It'd be weird if it was sealed by accident
[3:53:09] <scrublordsamurai> Remember when goofy hijacked that bus full of orphans?
[3:53:10] <Broken_Sonex> Goofy had a fake death scene and everything
[3:53:16] <%Too_Much_Nukie> Prepare for disappointment
[3:53:17] <%AzureGale> "Dad, zippers are SO uncool"
[3:53:19] <%psidefx> kerplow
[3:53:25] <%vexion_smh> purple of doom
[3:53:34] <adzy2k6> @Monkeyweed21 Which bahamut?
[3:53:35] <+Patchworq> First playthrough?
[3:53:37] <%Huntercd> Jen Hale?
[3:53:40] <KaitlynnHere> Oh snap
[3:53:41] <%Avalon_One> Evil pyramid
[3:53:44] <KaitlynnHere> I don’t remember this
[3:53:50] <%Monkeyweed21> @adzy2k6 every Bahamut
[3:53:56] <KaitlynnHere> So did she die?
[3:54:03] <scrublordsamurai> is this restored content?
[3:54:03] <KaitlynnHere> Bastilla
[3:54:04] <Gruhunchously> Bastila
[3:54:07] <olaksi> that lady sound like a british commander shepard
[3:54:08] <%Huntercd> She longs for Revan
[3:54:15] <+Patchworq> Bastilla
[3:54:20] <%Alazull> Agreed
[3:54:20] <Aydarkzero> bummer
[3:54:22] <Gruhunchously> @olaksi That's because she is
[3:54:23] <%YakumoYomi> Bri'ish?!
[3:54:24] <adzy2k6> @Monkeyweed21 Even FF XV bahamut? The one who had planet destroying death star power?
[3:54:25] <%Avalon_One> She thirsts for that purple lightsaber
[3:54:26] <%Too_Much_Nukie> That's how it is on this bitch of an Earth.
[3:54:29] <@commanderclaw> EA: Fuck the fans
[3:54:33] <%SaiyanShoto> I didn't get to see this when I played the game cause I was light side
[3:54:34] <Sapphire_Breeze> @olaksi same VA
[3:54:43] <Gruhunchously> The end of the Force, huh?
[3:54:59] <+hottbutts> Bastille got big lady boner for Revan.
[3:55:05] <KaitlynnHere> So bastilla is still rocking it or?
[3:55:05] <%Too_Much_Nukie> Charric and the axe you just got are both endgame weapons.
[3:55:06] <Goodvibes99508> charric is like the second best disruption rifle in the game
[3:55:09] <toothdreams> im still upset that EA took this franchise and turned it into an mmo
[3:55:13] <KaitlynnHere> Bustille
[3:55:23] <@commanderclaw> The only better one is in the restored content at the end of the game
[3:55:23] <Gruhunchously> Revan and Bastila were banging so hard after between the two games, I am convinced.
[3:55:25] <rosemon5001> the big shoots
[3:55:28] <%Monkeyweed21> @adzy2k6 Donald Duck casts ZettaFlare, which is orders of magnitude stronger than Terarflare, Bahamut's ultimate attack
[3:55:36] <+hottbutts> "when will my sith lover come back from the war?" *looks longingly out a window*
[3:55:40] <Gruhunchously> "I want items, not story" Then you're playing the wrong game.
[3:55:45] <Goodvibes99508> what happened to +5 str gloves?
[3:55:48] <Broken_Sonex> Hehe, Buttstilla hehehehe......
[3:55:49] <%Too_Much_Nukie> @toothdreams To be fair to EA, the writers of the MMO talk about how they want to make KOTOR 3 constantly. It's why the story references KOTOR so often.
[3:55:52] <adzy2k6> @Monkeyweed21 Never played KH XD Need to check that out now
[3:55:58] <%Ranryu692> but she's so hot!
[3:55:59] <olaksi> i mean you can be upset about EA, but following this up was always beyond bioware
[3:56:08] <KaitlynnHere> Whaaat
[3:56:11] <KaitlynnHere> Nooo
[3:56:17] <+ItalianWaifu> ItalianWaifu subscribed with Prime. They've subscribed for 2 months! 
[3:56:18] <%Alazull> TOR was really disappointed at high level
[3:56:22] <%ChrisPlaysThing> Tera was alright
[3:56:25] <RoboticRexkek> it doesn't not support controllers? uh.
[3:56:26] <+Gespens> TERA was a shockingly well made game
[3:56:27] <%Monkeyweed21> @adzy2k6 Donald Duck atomizes a dude and Winnie the Pooh can give you timestop and a gun
[3:56:28] <%Avalon_One> spinny blades
[3:56:33] <%PocketBearIllustrator> I love FFXIV's controller support.
[3:56:38] <Sapphire_Breeze> LUL
[3:56:38] <%Alazull> Took years for them to release content that was essentially single player that was worthwhile
[3:56:38] <Aydarkzero> oh no
[3:56:39] <%Too_Much_Nukie> TOR at launch was really bad but I enjoy it now.l
[3:56:45] <%Avalon_One> How did this happun?
[3:56:46] <Aydarkzero> evil points LUL
[3:56:49] <%YakumoYomi> @Gruhunchously I'm pretty sure she canonically had a daughter with Revan (Satile, I think?)
[3:56:50] <+absolutenc> doodOne
[3:56:55] <adzy2k6> @Monkeyweed21 Just found it. he probably cant beat sephiroth still
[3:56:56] <KaitlynnHere> Man, bastilla was so kewl
[3:56:58] <%BigCoffee> Why are you so obsessed with controller support? Clearly you have the means and setup to get yourself an amazing Kb+M going on (thanks to the cube)
[3:56:59] <+alphonseisbest> 14 plays fucking great on a controller
[3:57:04] <+absolutenc> saving is evil
[3:57:04] <%walternatorz> FFXI has controller support
[3:57:07] <faithless_zealot> @PatStaresAt I don't understand why you choose to cling to an inferior set of peripherals for gaming, Pat...
[3:57:18] <%Too_Much_Nukie> @YakumoYomi Satele is Bastilla's grandaughter.
[3:57:20] <Broken_Sonex> @YakumoYomi It was son and he was a loser
[3:57:22] <Sapphire_Breeze> @Too_Much_Nukie I stopped after knights of the fallen empire came out. Should I jump back in?
[3:57:29] <%cowardman93> I prefer controller for FF14 over keyboard
[3:57:29] <Aydarkzero> cause preference
[3:57:31] <+projectmanatees> anyone else to tempted to do another playthrough disco eyliusm just before the final cut
[3:57:33] <%Monkeyweed21> the steam controller is the future lol
[3:57:33] <%AzureGale> wtf
[3:57:33] <%Alazull> For comfort dickweed
[3:57:34] <Aydarkzero> the rematch
[3:57:37] <toothdreams> @Too_Much_Nukie I can tell that the writers actually care cause the story in TOR is pretty good but I know I'd enjoy it much more as a single player title
[3:57:37] <%Too_Much_Nukie> A lot of people forget how long after KOTOR the timeline in SWTOR is.
[3:57:40] <Gruhunchously> @YakumoYomi Yeah but we're rolling FemRevan in this continuity.
[3:57:41] <%YakumoYomi> Thanks for the clarification
[3:57:41] <%Cuddl3F1st> controller feels better
[3:57:43] <%BigCoffee> controller is more complez for 14 then kb+m
[3:57:45] <%SaiyanShoto> Keyboard and mouse is for heathens
[3:57:55] <%Ranryu692> M+K is only surperior for certain genres; for everything else, controller is way better
[3:57:56] <%Avalon_One> Controllers for life
[3:57:56] <olaksi> yet every time i ask ff14 player to do a simple thing they can't because a controller?
[3:57:56] <%cafefunk> Hey Pat are you still playing Genshin Impact?
[3:57:58] <@SoFarFetched> "how dare you pick a comfortable setup instead of optimal set up"
[3:58:05] <scrublordsamurai> @patstaresat i guess some people can't understand people have their own preferences
[3:58:06] <KaitlynnHere> Big crusty dick over here
[3:58:07] <%Too_Much_Nukie> @Sapphire_Breeze I think so, there's been like 3 big updates since then.
[3:58:15] <+alphonseisbest> CONTROLLER GANG
[3:58:19] <Aydarkzero> tripleSTIX <- superior
[3:58:20] <%AzureGale> I mean, I'm a mouse + keyboard kind of person, but if someone prefers a controller and they can use it well I don't have an issue with that
[3:58:29] <%Cuddl3F1st> yes, destroy your wrists with mouse and keyboard
[3:58:29] <+alphonseisbest> @olaksi Such as?
[3:58:38] <Aydarkzero> oh no!
[3:58:46] <%Avalon_One> Uh oh

[4:02:03] <%cowardman93> the power of Zangief's snores fixed the game
[4:02:08] <%Avalon_One> Gief has the big heckin paws
[4:02:09] <Gruhunchously> The KOTOR games are held together with duct tape, this one in particular
[4:02:12] <KaitlynnHere> The ebon hawk is powered by doggie snores
