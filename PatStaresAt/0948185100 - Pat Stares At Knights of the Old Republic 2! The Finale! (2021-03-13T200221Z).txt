[0:05:03] <%KishinGrek> le Final of KOTOR2
[0:05:39] <%Retinolgaming> Retinolgaming subscribed at Tier 1. They've subscribed for 5 months! Finale of my fave game of all time!
[0:05:54] <%rekinom> KOTOR 2 finale: Kay'ren kills the universe
[0:06:03] <%KishinGrek> was it KOTOR or Galaxies that had the expansion with the twin boys?
[0:06:18] <%dekkitout> The real Sith Lords were the friends we made along the way
[0:06:20] <%Retinolgaming> Swtor did that
[0:06:24] <%Gloom_Tangerine> Gloom_Tangerine subscribed with Prime. They've subscribed for 5 months, currently on a 1 month streak! hey pat, first of all congrats on the engagement! Second, I was wondering if you could settle a debate I was having with some friends: From what we see in the shows, are there any good parents in Starfleet? I say absolutely not.
[0:06:37] <%KishinGrek> @retinolgaming ah thank you
[0:08:28] <PirateMike_> this animation is awesome
[0:08:41] <%KishinGrek> wow I legitimately for got that was a Bioware game
[0:08:43] <%bassoontyphoon> agreed
[0:08:51] <+projectmanatees> man it'd be cool if bioware fixed kotor 1 so the andriod version inst the only good one
[0:09:42] <%bassoontyphoon> btw did the stream just start?
[0:09:46] <%KishinGrek> are we prepared if Bioware dies?
[0:09:50] <Frolomeo> not really sure what im currently staring at but i think im already impressed.
[0:10:13] <+Archphronimos> I'd argue Bioware has been dead for years
[0:10:19] <+projectmanatees> @KishinGrek its got some legs if the mass effect collection sells well
[0:10:21] <%Retinolgaming> @KishinGrek Its got some decent elements, some class stories are great, others are meh.
[0:10:31] <%KishinGrek> technically it died when the founders left but to see them outright die as a company would be sad
[0:10:31] <abelincoln_catpuncher> @kishingrek I mean I'd say they've been dead for a while now
[0:10:36] <+zeroarturia> zeroarturia subscribed with Prime. They've subscribed for 34 months! Hey Pat how's it going? Also the GG Strive withdrawal is for real
[0:10:37] <+projectmanatees> but dragon age 4 is the one to watch
[0:10:45] <rumtumtugnutz> @kishingrek at this point, yeah. bioware is already dead, just a shambling corpse at this point
[0:10:57] <%zeroarturia> n
[0:11:09] <%Retinolgaming> Weren't they planning to make Dragon age 4 a live service game like destiny?
[0:11:19] <abelincoln_catpuncher> I don't wish ill will upon the new BioWare games, but I don't expect anything good from them
[0:11:23] <%the22cstomp> the22cstomp subscribed at Tier 1. They've subscribed for 7 months! NFT actually stands for New Fun Toy (for zangief) I know that's a reach but please laugh

[0:12:25] <%KishinGrek> I never hope for the death of a company but Bioware may need a mercy killing
[0:12:26] <%rumtumtugnutz> anthem tried to happen, but it never really did.

[0:29:53] <devanmuse> Woolie immediately guns for the "racist cop" options
[0:29:54] <triggersqueeze1985> Zangief the cujo dog
[0:29:54] <gothicdoubling> hobocop baybee
[0:29:54] <%cvp5127> so you can do two lp by the time woolie finishes
[0:29:55] <%AyotoCorp> Woolie will be racist cop
[0:29:58] <%MugenSandan> ESSENCE OF HOBOCOP
[0:29:59] <+emperordread> I don't think I can handle a Woolie level slow LP of DE tbh LUL
[0:30:00] <%moonmintparadise> The fact that we do not have a date yet this far into march is making me so fucking anxious
[0:30:00] <RyanGelatin> those will be long ass playthoroughs too especially with the voice acting that game will bne wayy longer with the va
[0:30:01] <%miguelrod777> woolie killed a guy no hesitation in heavy rain remember
[0:30:09] <@SSaryn> Hobocop best cop.
[0:30:09] <Brandon__Brando> cant wait to watch it after I find out my cop style

[0:30:21] <%Nested_Dreams> Even though I'm the only one with the copy in this house
[0:30:22] <%Mr_Pylon> Woolie might just be Cop Cop
[0:30:23] <%KishinGrek> woolie killed another guy
[0:30:24] <faithless_zealot> Disco Elysium is a GREAT game, but it's gonna KILL your channel
[0:30:24] <@SSaryn> Hobocop.
[0:30:26] <$RealThiele> listen
[0:30:27] <%Ziegsy> Has he started the game yet?  wanna know if I can just settle in and turn tehe brain off
[0:30:27] <+Mrrccava> I would only be hobocop lol
[0:30:29] <marvel877> R1 IS ALWAYS TRIGGER, WOOLIE.
[0:30:31] <+chaumiester> Ah, so Woolie would have been an American Cop
[0:30:31] <%GarbageQueenEllie> I was Superstar cop, had a good ol time

[0:30:34] <%VashyronM> fuck it, hobocop
[0:30:35] <%moonmintparadise> the perfect cop
[0:30:41] <+Mrrccava> #WOOLIELIVESMATTER
[0:30:42] <%dekkitout> Had to do it to em
[0:30:44] <+D00msDayDan> he always does
[0:30:44] <+projectmanatees> sorry cop
[0:30:45] <faithless_zealot> It's slow and not very watcher friendly
[0:30:47] <triggersqueeze1985> Kill them faster
[0:30:56] <RyanGelatin> i think they mean itll be super long so yuoull be on the channel for a while
[0:30:57] <%emperordread> sorry cop 4 lyfe
[0:30:58] <%bassoontyphoon> hard disagree
[0:30:58] <%Mrbaconator> that sounds like a one guy
[0:31:00] <%NopeBadguy> BRO WE'RE PLAYING KOTOR
[0:31:01] <%mads_valentine> Fuck that! I'll watch it!
[0:31:02] <%Mrbaconator> that guys full of shit
[0:31:02] <RyanGelatin> itll be*
[0:31:04] <%Ynkubus_> no?
[0:31:05] <%moonmintparadise> i would watch an 8 hour stream of you on youtube
[0:31:07] <%Undenizen> it's existential crisis every 5 minutes
[0:31:07] <%Mrbaconator> HARD DISAGREE
[0:31:09] <faithless_zealot> I mean .. I guess we'll see =\
[0:31:09] <RyanGelatin> voice acting will make it EVEN SLOWER lmao
[0:31:13] <TrollKing96> @PatStaresAt Which do you think is bigger in terms of script, Planescape Torment or Disco Elysium?
[0:31:14] <%PanicSwytch> One guy
[0:31:14] <%Mrbaconator> fucking ONE GUY
[0:31:15] <+Freakin_Wolfy> Pat, did you ever play Nioh?
[0:31:16] <marvel877> I don't know, we've sat here watching Pat play worse stuff before
[0:31:17] <RyanGelatin> but yea does help watychability
[0:31:17] <@commanderclaw> Well we're going to have to be *real* hard on moderating once we get into the real ass politics of the game
[0:31:18] <%AncelDeLambert> all I remember is how pretentious that opening segment is as you talk to your own brain
[0:31:18] <%the22cstomp> it's not gonna be worse than kotor and kotor is doing fine
[0:31:21] <%AncelDeLambert> and how much I hated it
[0:31:22] <%moonmintparadise> the aesthetics in this game are so oog
[0:31:26] <%moonmintparadise> good
[0:31:30] <RyanGelatin> ok ya tru
[0:31:32] <%NopeBadguy> bro we're playing kotor right now, that is abjectly not true
[0:31:32] <%the22cstomp> my condolences @commanderclaw
[0:31:32] <%coward_man> we are on the 13th stream of kotor, the hell you mean it'll kill the channel
[0:31:34] <+D00msDayDan> the voice acting makes it MUCH more watcher friendly because the writing is what you're there for
[0:31:35] <@SSaryn> It's still gonna take like.. 20-40 hours.
[0:31:43] <@SSaryn> so for Woolie like 30-60 hours.
[0:31:44] <%coward_man> also the twitch man dies
[0:31:45] <%moonmintparadise> like 4 million lines lmao imagine doing voices for all of those
[0:31:45] <%NopeBadguy> kotor 2 is very slow and still very watcher friendly
[0:31:50] <+projectmanatees> @commanderclaw there is only one true way and thats the hoffric necktie
[0:31:51] <%GarbageQueenEllie> And it gets real tiring, I imagine
[0:31:51] <Zebroneath> yeahhhhh, I could tell
[0:31:52] <LKHamJams> Persona 5 hits different on stream
[0:31:59] <$RealThiele> also frees up attention span for the peepo
[0:32:00] <%Mrbaconator> @SSaryn 70-80
[0:32:01] <TrollKing96> Which do you think is bigger in terms of script, Planescape Torment or Disco Elysium?
[0:32:01] <%NopeBadguy> BRAIN FART
[0:32:05] <%Mrbaconator> monopoly money on it
[0:32:08] <%PanicSwytch> ur getting old
[0:32:10] <@SSaryn> @Mrbaconator Nah won't be that long.
[0:32:12] <%Undenizen> "Honey, what was I going to say?"
[0:32:14] <triggersqueeze1985> Bork

[0:33:40] <@SSaryn> The Internet has spoken.
[0:33:41] <penitentpendant> Missed your Monster Hunter stream so I was going to ask: Which monster introduced in Monster Hunter World would you like to see in Monster Hunter Rise?
[0:33:43] <%moonmintparadise> a million thousand !
[0:33:44] <+projectmanatees> will we see a spoilercast when you both finish it?
[0:34:03] <RyanGelatin> the entire lotr trilogy and the hobbit times two isnt even a million
[0:34:11] <penitentpendant> Fair enough
[0:34:12] <@SSaryn> Possible entire Monster list already out too.

[0:34:27] <LKHamJams> LETS GO!
[0:34:29] <penitentpendant> My friend is in love with the Water Dragon
[0:34:30] <%dekkitout> Bagel or Namiel
[0:34:31] <@SSaryn> Honestly I'd like Zamtrios to come back.
[0:34:34] <LKHamJams> THATS THE DUDE
[0:34:35] <%kujofire990> Nerg?
[0:34:38] <%hrbeck_> Dodo was new
[0:34:39] <%the22cstomp> bagel goose is the most unique monster in the game
[0:34:42] <%AncelDeLambert> Legiana
[0:34:42] <%coward_man> Bazel isn't in!?
[0:34:42] <%GarbageQueenEllie> @RyanGelatin Lol imagine if Disco Elyisum man had to deliver the One Ring
[0:34:43] <%moonmintparadise> Bazel would be fun lmao i want to see him get smacked by magnamalo
[0:34:48] <clockworkidiot> B 52 bomber
[0:34:50] <%AncelDeLambert> I need the Legi equipment, it's so beautiful
[0:34:51] <paperbaganimator> Paolumu?
[0:34:53] <LKHamJams> Best roar in the series I love Bazel's yell.
[0:34:53] <Chuckgofer> "Seed droppin like bezelgeuse"
[0:34:57] <Srthunda> close enough
[0:35:00] <+ALazo> bazel was cool but the way he was implemented felt like discount picklesaurus
[0:35:00] <@commanderclaw> "Gore Magala, I choose you!"
[0:35:03] <@SSaryn> Also got some good armor.
[0:35:05] <%moonmintparadise> his little dudes are in rise but no confirm on the big boy yet
[0:35:12] <%coward_man> man no B-52 in rize
[0:35:15] <PanicSwytch> Zamtrios actually looks like a pokemon
[0:35:19] <Tampaoster> Xeno'jiiva
[0:35:21] <+SocialMisfitGamer> I looked up Bazelguese, it's got like a fucking lava spike beard
[0:35:21] <+Dova573> ZAMTRIOS IS A THICK BOI
[0:35:22] <%dekkitout> Zamtrios, the absolute (Zero) unit
[0:35:23] <@SSaryn> And yeah I'd like Gore to come back in some capacity.
[0:35:25] <Ipsenscastle> googled, zamtrios confirmed sick
[0:35:26] <faithless_zealot> Nice!
[0:35:36] <$RealThiele> one kotor , please
[0:35:36] <+logoth_> Finish the fight AGAIN
[0:35:40] <penitentpendant> @coward_man But think of it! Grapplehooking onto a plassing bomber!
[0:35:51] <@SSaryn> So we have 4 hours to go.
[0:35:53] <%Alazull> You got a full strem
[0:35:54] <%moonmintparadise> what a journey..
[0:35:55] <%GarbageQueenEllie> Only Malachor, I believe. It's pretty long
[0:36:04] <+coward_man> @penitentpendant I know! it would be the coolest!
[0:36:05] <@commanderclaw> Malachor is like 60% bigger IMO
[0:36:07] <%NopeBadguy> You finished Base Disco Elysium, right? Consider playing Hardcore for the DC since it makes a ton of the game harder, but gives more XP for successful checks.
[0:36:40] <+SocialMisfitGamer> That sounds like shit
[0:36:45] <@SSaryn> That's fair honestly.
[0:36:57] <+projectmanatees> ooh you're in got a treat then
[0:37:03] <penitentpendant> Also, Disco Elysium allows you to branch in different directions WILDLY
[0:37:05] <%dekkitout> Whynot one of you have the mouse, and the other have the keyboard
[0:37:09] <@SSaryn> Did you guys at least get past Day 1?
[0:37:09] <+emperordread> Can't wait for more Cuno in DE
[0:37:11] <$RealThiele> Dark souls 3 done before wedding? maybe
[0:37:13] <+clientdevil> Pat what do you mean same rate
[0:37:16] <aeravon> @Ipsenscastle Indeed! He blows up like a balloon and rolls around like a jackass. It's the best
[0:37:45] <PirateMike_> and Pat is a gobbler
[0:37:50] <+clientdevil> That kind of restraint would be nice
[0:37:52] <@SSaryn> Is that why DS9 was so spaced out
[0:37:56] <+Undenizen> wait, are you hanging out with Plague?
[0:37:57] <%bassoontyphoon> did you clap when you saw it??
[0:37:58] <%Bailey__gaming> Hi Pat :) how are u doin?
[0:37:58] <+SocialMisfitGamer> And then she NEVER wants to watch after, right?
[0:37:59] <$jacob2pop> please get that Kotlr motor running boys
[0:38:02] <%GarbageQueenEllie> HK! HK! AT-STS!
[0:38:03] <Ipsenscastle> @aeravon balloon shark is a solid concept, im all for it
[0:38:03] <%Ziegsy> With shows Im a nibbler, but games im a gobbler
[0:38:04] <%Movemeister> I finished Mando today. Very enjoyable show.
[0:38:05] <%NopeBadguy> i fuckin lost it when i saw that krayt dragon
[0:38:07] <%dekkitout> Was there a full shot of that hk unit?
[0:38:08] <@SSaryn> Good
[0:38:10] <@SSaryn> You should
[0:38:13] <%MidnightBurst12> oh no
[0:38:13] <$RealThiele> LUL
[0:38:19] <%coward_man> cause Mando does references GOOD!
[0:38:19] <%NopeBadguy> but it didn't break new ground
[0:38:24] <PirateMike_> NEEEEEERD
[0:38:27] <%NopeBadguy> WHERE DID THAT COME FROM
[0:38:28] <@SSaryn> It broke ground we wanted it to
[0:38:30] <%NopeBadguy> DID YOU PULL THAT OUT OF YOUR ASS
[0:38:33] <%dekkitout> Also, shiny sticc for space cowboy knight
[0:38:45] <%emperordread> Carnivore CRONCH
[0:38:51] <Brandon__Brando> let the boi sleep
[0:39:02] <@SSaryn> Oh no
[0:39:06] <aeravon> @Ipsenscastle I agree, and he's generally an early-ish game monster. Monster Hunter has a lot of fascinating concepts like that. If you dont know, look up Queen Seltas.
[0:39:10] <%Bailey__gaming> really bummed out atm could dowith a hug
[0:39:13] <LittleMiniTinyJosh> Cheer500 Hi there Mr. Goblin Man! I've been thinking that I finally wan't finally want to dive in the cosmic horror of the PC nightmare, but I don't really have a lot of space in my room to set up a full desk so I been thinking of just buying a gaming laptop. So my question to the man who has infused himself into The Cube, what is a great starting gaming laptop? Anything I need to know before diving in.
[0:39:25] <%Mrbaconator> that's too many games
[0:39:26] <Zebroneath> Like Earthbound?
[0:39:28] <+SocialMisfitGamer> FROM THAT FAR BACK!?
[0:39:30] <@commanderclaw> Make a massive ass list and then have a huge poll to test the waters
[0:39:31] <dante_9x> YES
[0:39:32] <%NopeBadguy> Proton Jon actually does something similar where he fortune cookies his backlog.
[0:39:32] <%rytisone> full LP of ET
[0:39:33] <Brandon__Brando> fuck it sure
[0:39:36] <+emperordread> Yes, it's dope
[0:39:36] <$RealThiele> have some idiot make the list
[0:39:38] <@SSaryn> Oh just sit down and make a tier list of things to do a stream possibly in the future
[0:39:38] <+coward_man> that would be a nightmare to make
[0:39:38] <%Undenizen> hey man, if you're willing to put in the work!
[0:39:38] <%cvp5127> dont
[0:39:39] <%dekkitout> That's almost twenty years of games, you sure?
[0:39:40] <%brickwall35> play every game ever made
[0:39:41] <%MidnightBurst12> That's  a lot
[0:39:43] <TheFramedWarlock> Yeyeyeyeyeyeyeyeyeyeye
[0:39:44] <%GarbageQueenEllie> Lists r good Pat. Lists r gud
[0:39:44] <%bassoontyphoon> Sure
[0:39:46] <%Mrbaconator> so an entire list of only banjo kazooie
[0:39:46] <+blastazoid00> A LOT
[0:39:46] <OwlLightningMage> it would take too long
[0:39:47] <RayCSmooth> Say goodbye to sleep
[0:39:54] <%NoHoldsBarredProductions> Fuck yeah that's a great idea!
[0:39:54] <%coward_man> you should play Colonial Marines as build up for Alien Fireteam
[0:39:55] <%Broken_Sonex> Fallout 1
[0:39:55] <@commanderclaw> Like, names in a hat?
[0:39:56] <$homelesstwinky> yee sipsipDab
[0:40:01] <%Bailey__gaming> if it includes like Jazz Jackrabbit im down lol
[0:40:02] <OwlLightningMage> It would take way way too long
[0:40:02] <%dekkitout> *30 years
[0:40:03] <%NopeBadguy> He basically puts all his games into Backloggery and it rolls a random one to play. @PatStaresAt
[0:40:06] <@SSaryn> I assumed names in a hat yeah.
[0:40:06] <+SocialMisfitGamer> It'll take a while, but if you want to do it, then go for it
[0:40:24] <%emperordread> just grab a few "Top 100 games of all time" lists and merge em?
[0:40:24] <Chuckgofer> Pat play wolfenstein 3d, shoot gnatzis
[0:40:31] <%Undenizen> What's the best game you've never played?
[0:40:35] <$RealThiele> h u m p

[0:41:51] <+SocialMisfitGamer> Stop picking on your OLDER brother!
[0:41:55] <$RealThiele> pre-crime
[0:41:55] <%coward_man> he was being pushy

[0:42:46] <PinoProxie> brother pls may I have the snuggles
[0:42:53] <Chuckgofer> I want my tax refund so i can build a new PC :/
[0:42:53] <%NopeBadguy> Where did we end off? Start off Malachor V?
[0:43:07] <dekkitout> Elmo saying 'cmon' as gief presses him
[0:43:11] <$jacob2pop> Yeah, we had to train our bigger dog not to do that to our terrier, it can be an issue.
[0:43:13] <penitentpendant> Destroying that Nostalgia Filter
[0:43:13] <@SSaryn> Just gets progressively worse
[0:43:13] <%bassoontyphoon> Top Heavy??
[0:43:20] <OldManDeckardCain> it's like it was made by the same people LUL
[0:43:22] <+SocialMisfitGamer> Outer worlds? haven't played that in a while
[0:43:24] <moonmintparadise> drags on too much in certain ways
[0:43:25] <$RealThiele> wet fart ending
[0:43:31] <%NopeBadguy> Insane frontloading?
[0:43:37] <%moonmintparadise> OH YEAH HEAVY MACHINE GUNS FUCK UP EVERYTHING LMAO
[0:43:40] <%xMaSterKeef420bluntNinjAx> OH man did Outer Worlds drag. I was rushing to finish it by halfway
[0:43:45] <@SSaryn> What's the difference? Kappa
[0:43:49] <%MidnightBurst12> stops being a game at some point
[0:43:58] <%moonmintparadise> the new dlc looks good
[0:43:58] <Sotetsu> At that point just play Danganronpa
[0:44:04] <Broken_Sonex> Same devs same problems Kappa
[0:44:04] <@SSaryn> That's fair actually
[0:44:05] <penitentpendant> True
[0:44:07] <$RealThiele> LUL
[0:44:09] <Pookiedaexzile> IT's Almost as if we need something to do both
[0:44:16] <+OhioNitsud> just started watching the OW lp
[0:44:16] <%bassoontyphoon> So he did the best job
[0:44:16] <%moonmintparadise> edgewater
[0:44:22] <$RealThiele> corporate hellscape world
[0:44:29] <penitentpendant> They compartmentalized the world writing, and put the best first
[0:44:30] <$Afterman_> competent man
[0:44:39] <%dekkitout> The tone setter
[0:44:44] <Ipsenscastle> god I've forgotten all of Outer Worlds already, that's crazy
[0:44:47] <+SocialMisfitGamer> it's amazing. choosing between the corp and the little people was amazing
[0:44:53] <Pookiedaexzile> Let this man Cook
[0:44:57] <@SSaryn> I actually recently tried replaying it, played that one planet, got to Hullbreaker, and realized oh yeah.
[0:44:58] <%Alazull> That really doesn't make sense
[0:44:59] <Pookiedaexzile> Give this man a Raise
[0:45:07] <%moonmintparadise> edgewater had some good conflict that the other planets did not have
[0:45:14] <fatlystackedmac> maybe 3
[0:45:20] <%emperordread> compartmentalised story telling is boring af, look at Fallout 3 & 4
[0:45:21] <$RealThiele> expanse style
[0:45:22] <@commanderclaw> It had no cohesion
[0:45:30] <+SocialMisfitGamer> Are good writers hard to find these days?
[0:45:30] <%Alazull> You need a lead writer. Maybe give substories to other people but nah not your main narrative drive
[0:45:30] <%moonmintparadise> the other planets had no big decisions to make or factions to join that felt like they mattered
[0:45:32] <OwlLightningMage> Or a head writer
[0:45:36] <%NopeBadguy> You need a team of writers working together, not individuals gluing together individual pieces.
[0:45:36] <Ipsenscastle> I normally remember everything about a game, but it's been a year and a half and apart from the first and last planet that game is gone from my head
[0:45:39] <%moonmintparadise> OH GOD FUCK BYZANTHIUM THO
[0:45:40] <peyodogo> or one overseeing writer
[0:45:41] <%xMaSterKeef420bluntNinjAx> It's super inconsistent in tone and quality
[0:45:45] <penitentpendant> @Alazull It allows you to be 'done' faster because all the writers can write at the same time, rather than waiting 5 times as long for the one writer to finish.
[0:45:48] <%Mr_Pylon> Outer Worlds crumbled to the finish line
[0:45:51] <Chuckgofer> Have P+1 writers , p= number of planets
[0:46:01] <@SSaryn> Like what they did with that stat stuff though.
[0:46:02] <penitentpendant> The problems with trying to 'run things in parallel'
[0:46:06] <%DakotaMacDoodle> it was all right
[0:46:11] <%moonmintparadise> AA Game, you know, like a Battery
[0:46:11] <$Afterman_> its better than fallout 76
[0:46:11] <%bassoontyphoon> probably not
[0:46:11] <PinoProxie> Me neither
[0:46:21] <%GarbageQueenEllie> Siiiiigh
[0:46:24] <%emperordread> New Vegas 2 though
[0:46:27] <+Mottyrob> Outer Worlds was good but it was pretty... Limited.
[0:46:28] <%moonmintparadise> holy shit is that zangief snoring ?

[0:46:32] <@SSaryn> Does anyone know if Tyranny was even CLOSE to New Vegas
[0:46:35] <%Alazull> @penitentpendant Unfortunately being done faster is worthless if the product at the end isn't as good
[0:46:40] <%dekkitout> Will anything ever hit like new vegas within the next 7 years
[0:46:41] <%SvenHolgersson> psaElmo

[0:46:51] <PinoProxie> I did not hear good things about Tyranny
[0:46:55] <%moonmintparadise> well atleast they dont talk
[0:46:56] <%SvenHolgersson> HE WANT LIL BRUDDA
[0:46:57] <OwlLightningMage> They easily could top New Vegas. It was really good but unfinished as shit

[0:47:14] <Chuckgofer> peepoee poopoo
[0:47:18] <@SSaryn> I'm seeing Tyranny as Very Positive on Steam so now I'm wondering if this is even close to New Vegas
[0:47:22] <+SocialMisfitGamer> Boys be roughhousing
[0:47:23] <bob900000> does New Vegas have good writing? I've never played it
[0:47:23] <@commanderclaw> I would fucking kill for a remaster of New Vegas now that Microsoft owns both Bethesda and Obsidian
[0:47:25] <@SSaryn> Cause now I wanna know
[0:47:28] <+OhioNitsud> watching elmo sit on the arm rest in the OW lp made me miss seeing more of him since gief came in
[0:47:28] <%NopeBadguy> pizza time
[0:47:29] <%mads_valentine> You ever play the Someguy mod series for New Vegas? It's one of my favorite series of mods?
[0:47:29] <+SocialMisfitGamer> PIZZAAAAA
[0:47:32] <iosephe> pizza
[0:47:37] <%Broken_Sonex> New Vegas 2: Even  more Vegas.

[0:49:16] <OldManDeckardCain> NO FATHER, I NEED MY VUVUZELA!
[0:49:16] <%bassoontyphoon> Why doesn't Zangief simply eat the much smaller PAt

[0:59:06] <+SocialMisfitGamer> He's right
[0:59:08] <%dekkitout> The real pc nightmare is having to fuck around with ini dll and other files
[0:59:11] <Srthunda> it will also be really hot and might not be good for your lap
[0:59:12] <+LionKagura> Don't buy a laptop
[0:59:12] <%Alazull> Unless you plan on being mobile with it, get a desktop
[0:59:15] <%BluBox> It's a bad value most of the time
[0:59:15] <Chuckgofer> Agreed
[0:59:16] <+emperordread> You can get small form PCs, check those out dude
[0:59:22] <Sotetsu> Gaming laptops cost more upfront and later on because you can't upgrade
[0:59:22] <+jimmiepyle> i have both. gotta game on the go.
[0:59:28] <Paciboyy> if you wanna GAME ON THE GO just download a gameboy emulator on your phone like everybody else
[0:59:29] <ExpressNode> @aeravon Don't worry I enjoy a good time.  Bad movies included DarkMode
[0:59:29] <+TheCrispyBoi> laptops also get really hot

[0:59:47] <Ginganinja4545> My friend recently got a pc thats the size of a shoebox
[0:59:47] <%Alazull> You can find cases that are specfically made to be lower profile and still get decent cooling and STILL spend less than a gaming laptop

[1:00:22] <Pookiedaexzile> Plug it in to a tv like a cable box
[1:00:26] <ExpressNode> The size doesn't matter it's how you use it
[1:00:26] <+JobbedBone> your dollar just don't go as far, its hard to justify, but if you NEED the space you need it.
[1:00:28] <+SocialMisfitGamer> My desktop is on the carpet floor
[1:00:36] <+jimmiepyle> you can do what my roommate did and just get wireless keyboads and mice and hook it up to his TV

[1:01:26] <penitentpendant> Watching Pat is basically the same as 'demoing a game' for me
[1:01:26] <Tracazoid> Yeah horror gaming has a higher barrier of entry than a horror movie, in that you have to play it and it's not simply done an hour and a half in.

[1:02:35] <%Bailey__gaming> Foight Foight
[1:02:39] <+saltytyrz> what?
[1:02:40] <Chuckgofer> The only policy a republican proposed and he immediatly backed down like a coward
[1:02:40] <rcand9> dont shit self pat
[1:02:41] <%NopeBadguy> uh oh...
[1:02:42] <%dekkitout> Pull up that tweet with the animatic of Pat saying mommy milkers
[1:02:42] <Sypheck> code brown atpNinja
[1:02:45] <+SocialMisfitGamer> Oh he's getting the belt now
[1:02:47] <Sotetsu> Pee on them to break it up
[1:02:52] <%Bailey__gaming> Pants Shitting intensifies
[1:02:54] <OwlLightningMage> Beat them
[1:02:58] <Tracazoid> Elmo is trying to absorb Geif's power to be the one true Jet Li.
[1:02:59] <Pookiedaexzile> Bwark Milky Milky
[1:03:08] <OwlLightningMage> Pat is going to beat his children with love
[1:03:12] <+OhioNitsud> don't let Paige win the bet
[1:03:14] <+asgard147> "We're not fighting!" psaPorgmo psaDogchamp
[1:03:22] <Chuckgofer> CG pat thicc
[1:03:38] <OwlLightningMage> Paige will win that bet because Pat never eats fiber
[1:04:34] <%Grustamar> Ok but to piggyback on my question while pat's busy: I'm a switch-axe main casual player from World. How steep is the curve on GS in Rise? Is it a complicated weapon?
[1:05:04] <%VioletHeart> GS is easy peasy.
[1:05:12] <VioletHeart> At least in terms of moveset.
[1:05:24] <$SGrim> @Grustamar easy to use, difficult to master.
[1:05:29] <penitentpendant> @Grustamar The running gag for Great Sword is it's relatively simple compare to other weapons. It's more about timing and positioning, since your slow, than anything else.
[1:05:59] <penitentpendant> Ha, that was a grammatical nightmare
[1:06:14] <%Grustamar> Hm. And what if I like a spammier weapon? Something I can cover up my learning mistakes with more attacks/damage. Dual blades, I'd imagine?
[1:06:31] <%Grustamar> Sorry,  I just only used Switch Axe in MH:W and only then had like maybe 200 sporadic hours in it
[1:06:32] <OwlLightningMage> Longsword
[1:06:53] <~PatStaresAt> does this count as audience interaction
[1:07:06] <%Grustamar> absolutely
[1:07:06] <penitentpendant> Technically yes
[1:07:07] <peyodogo> sure
[1:07:07] <%Ynkubus_> yes pat
[1:07:10] <%Grustamar> To me
[1:07:10] <RLT917> atpCap
[1:07:12] <%BigDumBeak> bigdum1Wave hi pat
[1:07:16] <@SSaryn> Kind of
[1:07:17] <%JoshManVGH> @grustamar You may enjoy Switch Axe again. The Wirebug mobility seems to really open it up.

[1:08:44] <%Grustamar> I've only run a few missions in MH:R so far but the wirebug mechanic is almost too much for me when I'm smoking after a long day. Any ranged players in the chat? How's that work out? Are you still Spiderman-ing all over?

[1:17:47] <%JumboCrunchies> Also you really seem to enjoy it which is great
[1:18:03] <+MassConnect> I presume factorio has an actual objective in its story/campaign?
[1:18:04] <@commanderclaw> It's some DOOM shit. Walk past the corpses you made
[1:18:10] <+ReallyBigRocks> If you don't want to stream setting up stuff, maybe do a stream later just to show off your factory
[1:18:42] <Chuckgofer> Those fire effects boi
[1:18:43] <%Broken_Sonex> Kinda weird they didn’t teleport you back
[1:18:49] <CrypticMochi> It would cool if it was falling apart

[1:27:22] <%AncelDeLambert> Bao'dur explains in a little bit
[1:27:29] <Spudnacious_Dynasty> The force, duh
[1:27:33] <+jimmiepyle> nice reasons to not finish the last level
[1:27:39] <%AncelDeLambert> it's coming up you nerds psa3guy
[1:27:41] <%snow_bush> Gravity bomb that shattered the planet
[1:27:42] <alphonseisbest> the game totally tells u this my dude
[1:27:43] <%NopeBadguy> @patstaresat it's more explicit in light side
[1:27:48] <%snow_bush> BIG DEATH
[1:27:52] <%SvenHolgersson> Big Bao and Little Dur
[1:27:52] <%Broken_Sonex> Bao Dur made a gravity bomb.
[1:28:04] <alphonseisbest> yuuuuup
[1:28:06] <%Broken_Sonex> It was sick
[1:28:12] <%snow_bush> ....God I still remember BFA
[1:28:16] <+BananaSlammuh> Is Alliance better story than horde?
[1:28:17] <StripesUltimateEdition> 😔 horde never gets shit
[1:28:17] <%snow_bush> AND I HATE IT
[1:28:19] <alphonseisbest> thats for EVERY SW game
[1:28:25] <%snow_bush> No
[1:28:26] <%NopeBadguy> The council hints at this in Light Side. In Dark Side, all you get is a something later on.
[1:28:27] <%GarbageQueenEllie> They should've split the lore in half for each "side".
[1:28:34] <+Kingtut9009> Wut Horde bias in WoW os massive tho
[1:28:36] <$SGrim> How do you make a bomb add mass to something?
[1:28:37] <%TDotGoat> pff, you wish you had an empty unused tram
[1:28:39] <Fabpsi_> *hanging on to the last straw * well maaaybe it is easier to fall to the dark side and it is hard to work/stay on the light side? ... okay, i don't even believe myself right now
[1:28:41] <+projectmanatees> god imagine if 14 had a horde and alliance like thing
[1:29:03] <@commanderclaw> Honestly the dark side in Star Wars gets very little love. There's tons of ways to be evil that they don't explore at all
[1:29:04] <sendart> Then they started making the whole story about the horde
[1:29:14] <CrypticMochi> Man I wish they had more than 14 month and the management didn’t suck
[1:29:24] <%snow_bush> Alliance gets ignored unless they need someone to be beat up. Horde gets to be idiots every now and then when the story focuses on them> There are no winners, just different flavors of terrible
[1:29:25] <+Kingtut9009> Oh in Classic, that makes sense
[1:29:26] <alphonseisbest> when was the last time u played WoW pat? its been 15 years since OG Classic
[1:29:27] <+yourfriendtusks> but mankriks wife???
[1:29:31] <%SvenHolgersson> Oh you're a Troll? Go level with the orcs or whatever
[1:29:32] <%Mr_Pylon> Go fight giraffes for 15 levels you horde fucks
[1:29:46] <+jimmiepyle> OG warcraft was super heavy alliance. its the player base that ended up tilting the balance.
[1:29:47] <Fabpsi_> being long term evil. Like not wishing other people good morning at work. The truest of dark side
[1:30:10] <dirtyswampman> look at ragefire chasm lol
[1:30:12] <%NopeBadguy> Huh. I didn't know you played WoW.
[1:30:13] <+Kingtut9009> Yeah, Retail is like all Horde, Classic I can see it being all Alliance
[1:30:18] <%VashyronM> still is. Horde leaders are always turning traitor
[1:30:22] <%snow_bush> I've done both. Deadmines is FAAAAR better
[1:30:22] <%Alazull> Alliance gets the whole storyline with Onyxia and Horde gets NOTHING
[1:30:27] <%TDotGoat> all of Kalimdor was a rush job
[1:30:30] <$RealThiele> stocks had no loot
[1:30:33] <$RealThiele> and meh exp\
[1:30:49] <%Alazull> Stocks gets you Seal of Wrynn
[1:30:54] <%JohnAtDawn> Deadmines were the SHIT
[1:30:58] <%Alazull> And you can finish it in an hour
[1:30:59] <+shaybcakes> those are fuckin murlocs
[1:31:03] <%Mr_Pylon> they're Space Ogres?
[1:31:04] <revoltingimp> all the classic dungeons are trash
[1:31:06] <%TDotGoat> rocks
[1:31:07] <$Dakuu75> STORMS
[1:31:07] <blue8moon> force power
[1:31:08] <%rekinom> THey eat storms pat duh
[1:31:08] <$RealThiele> DM was wool country
[1:31:10] <+crazyspartan214> rocks I guess
[1:31:11] <%JumboCrunchies> The Force probably
[1:31:11] <+Delenay> storm?
[1:31:12] <%snow_bush> Storm beasts
[1:31:14] <%Undenizen> they eat dark force.
[1:31:14] <%dekkitout> Eachother of course
[1:31:15] <dirtyswampman> the fart gas
[1:31:15] <$SGrim> Storms. Duh.
[1:31:16] <Chuckgofer> They eat the force maybe?
[1:31:16] <+ThomasOfTroy> The force itself
[1:31:16] <%BluBox> Ground fart gas
[1:31:17] <+captain_thickthighs> cannibalism seems pretty sith
[1:31:17] <%MidnightBurst12> each other?
[1:31:17] <+Fooguwu> they suck that fart gas
[1:31:18] <aeravon> they eat the gravity farts
[1:31:18] <+SocialMisfitGamer> They're eating the fart gases
[1:31:19] <%GarbageQueenEllie> I had the same question about the Korriban wildlife
[1:31:20] <%Pukenasty> each other
[1:31:20] <alphonseisbest> the life force,,, i think
[1:31:22] <%Mr_Pylon> Corpses from the war?
[1:31:22] <%thatfeel> Fart gas
[1:31:24] <+friedcrispy> evil dark side energy?
[1:31:24] <+MassConnect> they eat minecraft mods
[1:31:27] <prisonsphere> echoes
[1:31:28] <arussoltzm> The dark side
[1:31:32] <+asgard147> The storm, silly
[1:31:32] <+jimmiepyle> they suck gas out the planets asshole
[1:31:34] <+Delenay> they look like a monster from star trek og
[1:31:36] <+MassConnect> and unused consumables
[1:31:38] <+BananaSlammuh> this planet isn't sustainable
[1:31:47] <+captain_thickthighs> that Rick and Morty episode when they were in the funhouse world
[1:31:48] <%dekkitout> Pat, the dark side is inherently unsustainable
[1:31:51] <Fabpsi_> fart gas üöamet- Wooliechor 5
[1:31:56] <Fabpsi_> *planet
[1:32:00] <Chuckgofer> more reason to force nuke it
[1:32:03] <OwlLightningMage> I love that this is literally Lonesome Road before Lonesome Road
[1:32:09] <vamvas37> What are your favorite features added with the cut content mod.
[1:32:10] <$Dakuu75> Pandorum could sustain its self on NOTHING BUT cannibalism
[1:32:13] <+friedcrispy> maybe the creatures don't actually exist and are manifestation of something something force realted
[1:32:26] <%NopeBadguy> @PatStaresAt Basically, the council hints at what happened on Dantooine if you let them live.
[1:32:29] <%AncelDeLambert> ... yeah. This is Lonesome Road
[1:32:31] <alphonseisbest> little bit
[1:32:34] <%BluBox> Ye
[1:32:35] <%mads_valentine> What?
[1:32:35] <bojangles_jolyne> oh no
[1:32:35] <+TheCrispyBoi> sure
[1:32:36] <%NopeBadguy> So I think that guy just thought you were lightside for some reason
[1:32:38] <Fabpsi_> hit us
[1:32:39] <alphonseisbest> shoot
[1:32:40] <Chuckgofer> That big mod that imploded?

[1:32:45] <OwlLightningMage> You not playing not DLCs is a big bummer
[1:32:51] <%AncelDeLambert> yeah

[1:33:01] <%snow_bush> BEAR AND BULL
[1:33:04] <%MidnightBurst12> LUL
[1:33:04] <nivlac_555> lmao
[1:33:05] <MrLily> maybe there's a mod for that now?
[1:33:07] <+SocialMisfitGamer> HUH!?
[1:33:07] <Chuckgofer> FUCK
[1:33:07] <+Kingtut9009> He was supposed to be your Legion comnpanion
[1:33:08] <Fabpsi_> wait what.
[1:33:09] <%AncelDeLambert> ... interesting reason

[1:33:14] <%dekkitout> HAHAHA
[1:33:14] <Fabpsi_> Thats is THE reason? Wow

[1:33:20] <+asgard147> limesCry
[1:33:21] <Nix_Abyss> which is ass because with mods its sick
[1:33:23] <%mads_valentine> Really?
[1:33:25] <Thepothero> BEAR BULL BEAR BULL rooScream
[1:33:26] <nivlac_555> fucking sexbox
[1:33:28] <Fabpsi_> oh boy Good bad old times
[1:33:28] <%dekkitout> Ulysses TALKS
[1:33:31] <%Grustamar> @NopeBadguy This was OG xbox
[1:33:32] <+NopeBadguy> FIRST THE 360 SPLIT MASS EFFECT 2 IN HALF
[1:33:32] <alphonseisbest> but I think it worked out better that way TBH
[1:33:34] <Sotetsu> Sounds like they should release some New Vegas DLC, then.
[1:33:34] <extradopeness> Now I’m cry
[1:33:35] <%Divryne> @PatStaresAt So basically he was NV's version of Kreia?
[1:33:36] <%NopeBadguy> THEN THERE'S THIS
[1:33:36] <%thatfeel> Dude likes to talk
[1:33:43] <%mads_valentine> I want the Hanged Man party member,
[1:33:44] <+NopeBadguy> @Grustamar I'm talking about NV
[1:33:44] <Fabpsi_> imagine that nowadays
[1:33:48] <Brandon__Brando> man fuck consoles
[1:33:48] <%ArchimerCXV> you people upset he drones on an entire DLC whilst other companions get hours if not playthroughs to get shit off their chest?
[1:33:50] <%AncelDeLambert> look at this Deathclaw
[1:33:53] <%Grustamar> @NopeBadguy Shit my bad dude.
[1:33:55] <OwlLightningMage> He has the best dialogue too
[1:33:56] <Fabpsi_> "Yea we can't do that. The npc talks toooo much!"
[1:34:04] <%vivaldiva> damn i wanted more "THE   D I V I D E"
[1:34:18] <+NopeBadguy> @PatStaresAt Did you ever look into trying the Old Republic?
[1:34:18] <Chuckgofer> Thanks for making my blood presure spike, pat
[1:34:18] <%hax_metatron> Has Pat heard of Loop Hero
[1:34:19] <%asgard147> oh no, it one of those things you've been killing with ease!
[1:34:20] <KaitlynnHere> So, are you gonna tell Kreia to suck it or what? @patstaresat
[1:34:20] <%AncelDeLambert> I love this scene, because the perspective is great. Just this MASSIVE fucking dinosaur running up to you and you slowly going "oh wow that is a BIG fucking dinosaur"
[1:34:27] <KaitlynnHere> Ya think?
[1:34:28] <+jimmiepyle> but pat light side get *push*
[1:34:32] <OwlLightningMage> The Jedi Master can also use sith powers. Woolie did
[1:34:37] <ARDM112> This section is just easy, I rolled my face on a keyboard as a defensive Jedi duelist here and it didn't matter
[1:34:48] <%AncelDeLambert> to be fair, the first time you play this game your build usually sucks shit, so that thing is pretty intimidating
[1:34:49] <%dekkitout> @ArchimerCXV People hate being lectured at, but lectured with however psaCrazyhand
[1:34:50] <Fabpsi_> well Woolie had a strange...endgame jedi^^'
[1:35:00] <%NopeBadguy> Force Powers aren't alignment locked. Opposite alignment powers cost more, but you get so much FP that it doesn't fucking matter.
[1:35:00] <OwlLightningMage> Woolie had so many force points that the extra cost didn't matter
[1:35:03] <%Broken_Sonex> I’m starting to think the best way to play is Male and light side @patstaresat
[1:35:12] <%notsoy> lol imagine being such a terrible sith you get killed by guns
[1:35:17] <KaitlynnHere> @jimmiepyle oh no! I was pushed and can’t get up!
[1:35:29] <@commanderclaw> @Broken_Sonex That's because it is
[1:35:29] <revoltingimp> yeah that's right
[1:35:30] <%Grustamar> "Sup, nerds?"
[1:35:32] <bojangles_jolyne> Raiden, they're using active camouflage!
[1:35:35] <Fabpsi_> kneeeeel
[1:35:37] <%AncelDeLambert> that's right, I can kill you all with a thought
[1:35:48] <bojangles_jolyne> oh no, a ball
[1:35:49] <%TwoStarPlayersNik> I remember playing this section right when it came out, and the ending wasn't finished for like, both dark and light side alignments, so you kinda got the same ending ish no matter what side you were on, and it made sense with one but not the other
[1:35:54] <%asgard147> They know their place limesEvil
[1:35:54] <Fabpsi_> best mission incoming
[1:35:57] <%GarbageQueenEllie> Now Pat finally play as ORB
[1:36:02] <%Broken_Sonex> @commanderclaw thank god that was my first play through
[1:36:03] <%NopeBadguy> So this is where they mention it outright before chat ruiined it
[1:36:04] <%AncelDeLambert> maaaaaaaaan, I still wish so hard that Revengeance had camoflauge on Raiden
[1:36:24] <TourettesPlays> oh yea Bao Dur is dead btw RIP in peace
[1:36:26] <Fabpsi_> the deadliest of balls. Brings death where it goes. And is very tiny, like a star in the distance. We could give it the nickname Deathstar!
[1:36:30] <KaitlynnHere> @twostarplayersnik yea it ruined the whole play through for me
[1:36:36] <+jimmiepyle> look at this bullshit they shoe in at the end lmao
[1:36:41] <$RealThiele> googly eyes
[1:36:42] <%NopeBadguy> @PatStaresAt Yeah, this is where they mention it. The council will hint about it on Dantooine if they're alive.
[1:36:43] <OwlLightningMage> Mass Shadow Generator is a good name
[1:36:49] <%notsoy> dead? who killed him tho
[1:36:49] <Thepothero> Oh man I hated this bit
[1:36:53] <alphonseisbest> man Bao Dur voice just lulls to sleep love it
[1:36:57] <%AncelDeLambert> so what does this thing canonically do? Black Hole collapse the core?
[1:36:58] <StripesUltimateEdition> is this the... instructions for lightside players
[1:37:02] <Fabpsi_> googly eyes on a flying tiny robo-ball would be pretty neat
[1:37:03] <%GarbageQueenEllie> Mass Shadow Moses
[1:37:09] <Chuckgofer> SAVe
[1:37:11] <+SocialMisfitGamer> don't fuck up, Pat
[1:37:13] <%NopeBadguy> @notsoy Rushed development
[1:37:14] <%Undenizen> DO YOU LIKE STEALTH?
[1:37:18] <@commanderclaw> Better have nuked all those enemies!
[1:37:21] <Nix_Abyss> BALL
[1:37:30] <+Kingtut9009> Oh god this is going to suck isnt it
[1:37:34] <%dekkitout> You finally did it- you became orb
[1:37:35] <$RealThiele> im thinking orbees
[1:37:36] <%TwoStarPlayersNik> be the ball
[1:37:36] <%Movemeister> always have been
[1:37:37] <TourettesPlays> is it even possible to die here?
[1:37:44] <Fabpsi_> what's that around the corner? A giant Alien-Dog?! Oh no, he sees the ball, he wants the ball!
[1:37:46] <SirCacaPee> This man is staring at a video game
[1:37:47] <+SocialMisfitGamer> BECOME THE ORB
[1:37:48] <$Dakuu75> anyone know how to use "theatre mode" full screen on twitch? (Mine will still show the address bar and browser-shit)
[1:37:49] <Chuckgofer> RORB
[1:37:55] <%TwoStarPlayersNik> the real friends were the balls we were along the way
[1:37:57] <KaitlynnHere> Psssh, yea play as the ball but not bao dur
[1:38:03] <%Grustamar> Pat'
[1:38:04] <Brandon__Brando> man obsidian just never has time to make there games
[1:38:04] <%asgard147> Pat has become ORB
[1:38:09] <+MassConnect> too bad Pat left stuff alive
[1:38:11] <%Grustamar> Pat's final form - the True Orb.
[1:38:11] <Chuckgofer> alt+t
[1:38:14] <+Skelegroove> @dakuu F11 works
[1:38:22] <Tracazoid> Hey it's what Pat wants to be when he abandons his physical form
[1:38:23] <%NopeBadguy> You're very fast but you die in like three hits
[1:38:25] <vamvas37> the remote was the main character all along
[1:38:27] <%NopeBadguy> And can't do shit for damage
[1:38:35] <Fabpsi_> finally you play as the main character of kotor2
[1:38:37] <%TwoStarPlayersNik> baller swag droid
[1:38:55] <TourettesPlays> Can't you only die here if you don't clear out all the monsters as Karen?
[1:39:07] <%TwoStarPlayersNik> you must think like the ball, to truly be the ball
[1:39:26] <%NopeBadguy> I mean I guess you could just like Force Speed past all of them
[1:39:54] <$Dakuu75> thanks <3
[1:39:56] <bojangles_jolyne> damn look at it go
[1:39:57] <%notsoy> you could stealth past everything if you're dumb and a coward
[1:40:17] <Fabpsi_> surely they had enough time to test stuff out, like not killing every enemy before this sequence starts...right?
[1:40:25] <TourettesPlays> Stealth is KOTOR lmao
[1:40:37] <%NopeBadguy> yeah you could stealth past everything if you wanted to add like an extra two hours to this game LUL
[1:40:50] <@commanderclaw> 14 months!
[1:40:53] <%NopeBadguy> stealth in classic crpgs in general is very bad
[1:41:00] <%NopeBadguy> the only exception i think is deus ex
[1:41:04] <%GarbageQueenEllie> Yeah...
[1:41:13] <TourettesPlays> It's kind of useful during that one part on Dxun before the sith temple, thats all i can think of
[1:41:13] <%NopeBadguy> well, if you could call deus ex a crpg
[1:41:17] <%NopeBadguy> i would
[1:41:22] <+Kitafin> yo yo
[1:41:25] <%notsoy> if the game is not purpose-built for stealth then it will always be terrible, like the bits with makoto in yakuza 0
[1:41:49] <%BakiinPlaysStuff> I'm sorry I just tuned in. are we the fucking ball right now?
[1:41:53] <TOMO_VENDOR> @notsoy makoto has build in stealth
[1:41:55] <%Grustamar> I spent like 5 years as a stealth-based player in Ultima Online
[1:41:58] <Fabpsi_> yea, pretty fast tiny orb
[1:42:01] <%Grustamar> A true nightmare
[1:42:06] <MrLily> Ball is Life

[1:47:18] <SaltyAzteca> @Chuckgofer HE DID
[1:47:25] <%NopeBadguy> It's because he's unarmed
[1:47:30] <%NopeBadguy> They assume you give him a lightsaber

[1:50:37] <%AncelDeLambert> oh geez I wonder which Pat will choose
[1:50:46] <+crazyspartan214> coward on light side; coward on dark side
[1:50:46] <+megaman_sentinel> I'm here to see the manager
[1:50:47] <+SocialMisfitGamer> ...ok
[1:50:54] <+Delenay> wait... didnt the bad guy kill these mooks when she got onto this planet earlier
[1:50:55] <Chuckgofer> clearly do the evil thing, fuck your friends
[1:50:56] <%Broken_Sonex> IMMA SEE THE MANAGER NOW!
[1:51:04] <%NopeBadguy> @PatStaresAt If you go after your party, you can totally just kill them yourself if I recall right
[1:51:10] <%TwoStarPlayersNik> I feel like every part of the end of this game is so busted
[1:51:15] <+SocialMisfitGamer> Where's the manager!!??
[1:51:23] <%TwoStarPlayersNik> it's held together by duct tape
[1:51:25] <Chuckgofer> He's so evil it wraps around to green again
[1:51:27] <saraizarai> wait what
[1:51:29] <+SASMARV> save
[1:51:36] <%Broken_Sonex> I like that actually
[1:51:38] <%dekkitout> Save your friends, or dont.
[1:51:39] <%NopeBadguy> @PatStaresAt They frame it as such but it's really not. You can just skip to the end or go get your party.
[1:51:43] <extradopeness> Zzzzzap!
[1:51:44] <%asgard147> save
[1:51:47] <%GarbageQueenEllie> Now you must choose, Kae'Ryn. POWER... or TIDDY
[1:52:05] <Bust_ER> go the which way you go
[1:52:07] <%AncelDeLambert> you have to talk to the walking scab
[1:52:16] <%NopeBadguy> I...actually don't remember that because they never quite make it clear, lmao
[1:52:17] <$SGrim> Always choose tiddie
[1:52:24] <+crazyspartan214> Karen is like; excuse me, I must see your manger!!! I have a compliant!!!
[1:52:29] <TourettesPlays> Using force drain on these big groups of sith makes the loudest fucking sound
[1:52:30] <+megaman_sentinel> to the right is friends
[1:52:30] <+BananaSlammuh> there's a prison block i believe but this area all looks the same
[1:52:36] <arussoltzm> Party is right side entrance I think
[1:52:37] <Chuckgofer> force lightning broken, canon
[1:52:40] <%AncelDeLambert> ALL POSSIBLE COURTESY
[1:52:41] <%NopeBadguy> But you can totally explore the whole fucking temple no consequence
[1:52:45] <%Broken_Sonex> Go save the Goth PAWG Patrick
[1:52:45] <baronblank> that storm is ridiculous
[1:52:46] <%AncelDeLambert> GUEST OF HONOR
[1:53:06] <%Grustamar> @Broken_Sonex based
[1:53:10] <+LionKagura> No problabo?
[1:53:15] <%TwoStarPlayersNik> "Is the dark side stronger?" "No, but dey got big ol tiddies"
[1:53:21] <%cade_calrayn> This feels extremely cheap but totally on brand for Pat
[1:53:44] <Chuckgofer> Go save goth mommy milkers!
[1:53:54] <%GarbageQueenEllie> Something tells me Pat would love the Inquisitor class in SWTOR
[1:53:58] <+megaman_sentinel> she is so mad
[1:54:08] <%Broken_Sonex> @grustamar it’s the right thing to do
[1:54:19] <saraizarai> To be fair, I'm just confused now
[1:54:31] <TourettesPlays> Yea the big giant sith academy out of nowhere is a bit abrupt
[1:54:32] <%NopeBadguy> @PatStaresAt All they did here with the mod was restore cutscenes, which may make it more confusing
[1:54:38] <%TwoStarPlayersNik> they SUPER ran out of money before they could make the ending of the game
[1:54:38] <%cade_calrayn> That's KOTOR 2 for you
[1:54:39] <%Broken_Sonex> @patstaresat just more stuff was added. That’s it
[1:54:41] <+MassConnect> you were young that long ao
[1:54:44] <+MassConnect> ago
[1:55:30] <SaltyAzteca> Force Storm in stereo

[1:55:34] <%GarbageQueenEllie> bbbbbzzzzaaaapppp
[1:55:35] <+luftraumm1> Karen's melee combat is kind of shit
[1:55:35] <Chuckgofer> tbf I'm still confusaed about stuff with this gane and im 32
[1:55:39] <+Delenay> they were just xp
[1:55:40] <%NopeBadguy> @PatStaresAt Since they don't make it clear, do you want me to tell you where to go to go to your party?
[1:55:42] <%cade_calrayn> Oh is this is a mod?
[1:55:47] <Fabpsi_> it is even hitting some of the dudes in the other room

[1:57:29] <revoltingimp> nah, the sounds fine
[1:57:29] <%cade_calrayn> @faithless_zealot lool
[1:57:32] <%sajuk_khar> So what comes after KotOR2?
[1:57:34] <+ReallyBigRocks> Wasn't even louder than your voice lmao
[1:57:37] <bojangles_jolyne> ZZZZZT
[1:57:40] <faithless_zealot> @cade_calrayn <3
[1:57:45] <Brandon__Brando> wow thats broken lamo
[1:57:45] <+ReallyBigRocks> You've got fat limiters on right?
[1:57:49] <Fabpsi_> those dudes, just hanging out with a huge monster in 1 tiny room
[1:57:50] <Yakobro> @sajuk_khar sadness
[1:57:55] <Chuckgofer> Pat stares at TOR?
[1:57:57] <revoltingimp> lmao, don't even need line of sight
[1:58:10] <%dekkitout> Kaeryn just strolling through like a stormcaller
[1:58:12] <%sajuk_khar> @Yakobro or Disco Elysium!
[1:58:17] <%cade_calrayn> isn't there like a Force energy bar or something?
[1:58:27] <TourettesPlays> Star Forge is a much stronger final level, except for [You must gather your party before venturing forth]
[1:58:29] <%NopeBadguy> Yeah the "choice" they frame here is stupid. "Go save your friends, but you'll be exhausted" as if you aren't a fucking super jedi at this point.
[1:58:32] <revoltingimp> so next playthrough is SWTOR, specifically the Revan parts, yeah?
[1:58:37] <%cade_calrayn> or can you just spam heals and Force storm nonstop
[1:58:48] <Fabpsi_> it is in the bottom right corner, but pat has enough force around. So we don't need to see it cade
[1:58:55] <extradopeness> I just watched that review
[1:59:03] <bojangles_jolyne> oh no, guys with guns!
[1:59:05] <%cade_calrayn> *sigh* y'all are making me want to go replay KOTOR.... I wrote the Revan article on Wookieepedia back in my admin days
[1:59:06] <%Grustamar> Just a room full of dudes.
[1:59:07] <TourettesPlays> @revoltingimp its lore we can do without
[1:59:10] <bojangles_jolyne> LMAO ONE HIT
[1:59:21] <%Mrbaconator> AND WEAKER FOR IT LUL
[1:59:31] <%GarbageQueenEllie> Dropping like flies
[1:59:36] <%NopeBadguy> "And she'll be weaker for it" she says
[1:59:36] <saraizarai> It's like trying to exhaust superman by having him wrestle elementary schoolers
[1:59:37] <%Grustamar> ZZZZZZZZAP
[1:59:38] <revoltingimp> @TourettesPlays whaaaaaat Kappa
[1:59:39] <TourettesPlays> I think you can find a really strong crystal in one of those prison cells
[1:59:40] <bojangles_jolyne> lmao karyn doing the lightsaber macarena whenever she gets shot
[1:59:47] <@commanderclaw> These dudes actually drop some of the best lightsaber crystals in the game
[1:59:49] <Chuckgofer> Easily
[1:59:50] <extradopeness> ZZZZZZZZZAP
[2:00:07] <Fabpsi_> true, the drops can be really great around here
[2:00:20] <%TwoStarPlayersNik> Isn't that just the plot of Redo of Healer?
[2:00:29] <%NopeBadguy> nice jedi grenade
[2:00:33] <%NopeBadguy> a civilized weapon
[2:00:43] <saraizarai> I never get how there are so many goddamn sith when there are supposed to be 2
[2:00:47] <bojangles_jolyne> damn they just have sith lords lying around here
[2:00:50] <%vehementvadr> smoke bomb
[2:00:52] <+SocialMisfitGamer> Imagine if Jedis can use force lightning
[2:00:54] <+luftraumm1> I remember getting some dope crystals in this part
[2:00:54] <TourettesPlays> did the final hanharr vs mira fight happen already?
[2:00:57] <bojangles_jolyne> sith lords doing the gardening, sith lords mopping the floors
[2:01:00] <bojangles_jolyne> all over the shop
[2:01:02] <%Mrbaconator> a little
[2:01:03] <%TwoStarPlayersNik> The Rule of 2 wasn't always a thing
[2:01:05] <%NopeBadguy> @saraizarai Rule of Two isn't established yet, I believe
[2:01:07] <%dekkitout> Rule of two is way after the events in this game
[2:01:11] <Fabpsi_> well, they are not real "sith", they just like to cosplay as sith
[2:01:12] <Chuckgofer> Rule of 2 didnt exist yet probably
[2:01:16] <%Mr_Pylon> Maybe Kreia was breaking the 4th wall, saying that you Pat will be tired by the end of this path
[2:01:18] <saraizarai> Oh
[2:01:20] <%notsoy> mira vs hanharr is light side only i believe, pretty sure she's dead in dark side
[2:01:22] <%Broken_Sonex> @SocialMisfitGamer Plo can, but the Oder were real bitches about it.
[2:01:29] <+megaman_sentinel> go back
[2:01:31] <%dekkitout> Eves still they don't follow rule of two after
[2:01:33] <%NopeBadguy> Because she wants you to be weaker for it LUL
[2:01:38] <@commanderclaw> It was probably supposed to be a legit area, but no time
[2:01:39] <bojangles_jolyne> ZZZZZZZTTT
[2:01:39] <+Midashu> Kreia just loves betrayal, so she probably just wanted to kill all the Sith here too to make you the stronkest Karen
[2:01:51] <+luftraumm1> isn't rule of 2 an ancient sith bs going back centuries even before this?
[2:01:52] <%NopeBadguy> I KNOW
[2:01:54] <Fabpsi_> they made it as big as a "planet"-map, but it is just totally empty. strange type of "labyrinth"
[2:02:02] <SaltyAzteca> Unlimited poweeer~
[2:02:07] <+Grustamar> Just stomping room to room cooking literally every moving thing I see.
[2:02:08] <%GarbageQueenEllie> "She'll be weaker for it" "YOU UNDERESTIMATE MY POWER!!"
[2:02:09] <Link232> Feels like you've killed more people in this one area than you have the entire game
[2:02:15] <%NopeBadguy> Party's in here
[2:02:18] <%Grustamar> ZZZZZZZORMP
[2:02:19] <Fabpsi_> save

[2:03:46] <%moonmintparadise> the ultimate karen
[2:03:47] <+Goliz> @luftraumm1 Technically the rule of 2 happens after this because of how much backstabbing and infighting there is within the sith order.

[2:04:04] <%Mr_Pylon> As long as HK lives

[2:04:11] <Fabpsi_> magic gas, you can't hold your breath for that
[2:04:11] <@commanderclaw> That should give you a level
[2:04:13] <%Grustamar> Gotta get that sith juice
[2:04:14] <%NopeBadguy> @PatStaresAt Aren't you glad you came to save your friends from Mika
[2:04:19] <tanarath> @dekkitout Depends. if you want the yuuzhan vong, he was prepping for them
[2:04:19] <bojangles_jolyne> more DSP
[2:04:19] <+Midashu> oh no, not GAS, there's no way you'll be able to survive that!
[2:04:20] <+megaman_sentinel> Atton is alive
[2:04:21] <%NopeBadguy> THERE'S LITERALLY NO BENEFIT
[2:04:23] <%baronblank> that will be pretty funny if she does react to it
[2:04:23] <bojangles_jolyne> dark side points that is
[2:04:25] <bojangles_jolyne> not phil
[2:04:26] <%Broken_Sonex> Didn't you teach Visas to hold her breath?  @PatStaresAt
[2:04:30] <%NopeBadguy> THE ONLY BENEFIT IS DARK SIDE POINTS
[2:04:31] <tanarath> otherwise, he was being evil
[2:04:36] <%GarbageQueenEllie> Why do you keep calling him Mika tho?
[2:04:36] <$RealThiele> Atton knew what was up and ran
[2:04:37] <%Mrbaconator> man im like a sith but you're evil! waaa
[2:04:37] <%dekkitout> @tanarath An acceptable answer
[2:04:39] <Fabpsi_> damn you are right ATTON is still alive
[2:04:41] <Srthunda> I wish you could at least choose who to kill
[2:04:41] <%coward_man> couldn't Mando use his sealed helmet to not breath the poison?
[2:04:44] <%WhereIsWill> rip visas BibleThump
[2:04:44] <%moonmintparadise> such a small button press and yet such a big decision
[2:04:49] <%Broken_Sonex> Wow, guess that's on her then
[2:04:52] <%asgard147> Now, let's go murder that bitch limesEvil
[2:04:53] <+Kitafin> can take your stuff back?
[2:04:58] <%Broken_Sonex> Idiot
[2:04:59] <%SvenHolgersson> KA-RHEN DEMANDS TO SEE THE MANAGER OF THE FORCE
[2:05:02] <saraizarai> Atton is still alive, find him
[2:05:04] <%baronblank> gotta find the rest separately I assume
[2:05:05] <%SvenHolgersson> AND TELL THEM THEY'RE WRONG
[2:05:06] <%moonmintparadise> how will you kill hk he has n lungs
[2:05:14] <%NopeBadguy> Sealed Helmet and Force Breathing isn't going to change the fact they're still locked in there with it
[2:05:15] <Fabpsi_> that coward
[2:05:21] <bojangles_jolyne> find atton and kick his ass!
[2:05:24] <+MassConnect> hanharr?
[2:05:26] <%NopeBadguy> They're going to run out of air eventually
[2:05:27] <%asgard147> Atton ran like a bitch
[2:05:31] <+luftraumm1> I think the structure of this world cannot actually function with such an overwhelming murder hobo
[2:05:33] <ExpressNode> After all these years I think the PS3 still has the best movie player for consoles
[2:05:42] <+crazyspartan214> where is Hanharr?
[2:05:44] <Fabpsi_> hanharr is more like a big pet
[2:05:52] <$Futurecity10> Hanharr died in the crash
[2:05:58] <saraizarai> Does hanhar count as a party member? He's like a dog
[2:05:59] <%MidnightBurst12> hanharr is dead as far as the story is concerned
[2:05:59] <%dekkitout> Why is Hanharr
[2:05:59] <%NopeBadguy> aren't you glad you came to save your friends
[2:06:00] <Fabpsi_> dropped down with the ship as far as i care
[2:06:06] <%Broken_Sonex> Yeah, fuck Hanhaar. Kill that nothing walking carpet. At least Mira was nice to look at.
[2:06:06] <%NopeBadguy> wait did hanharr actually die in the crash

[2:06:17] <SaltyAzteca> Thats the point Kappa
[2:06:19] <%mihokspawn> Echoes

[2:06:22] <%asgard147> Sith Magic
[2:06:24] <+luftraumm1> like,  is there a limit to Karen's murder? theoretically she would be even more dangerous than nihilous
[2:06:24] <$RealThiele> Academy too angry to die
[2:06:26] <%Grustamar> Look upon your dominion - a fucking craggy nightmare rock hellscape
[2:06:27] <tanarath> The use the force

[2:07:02] <%Mr_Pylon> it's been like 10 years since the war right? that's a fast build for the facility then
[2:07:07] <+Grustamar> @bojangles_jolyne Is he union?
[2:07:08] <%NopeBadguy> No shit, Vader made a fucking castle on Mustafar bc he hated Obi-wan so much
[2:07:10] <Yakobro> LUL
[2:07:12] <%dekkitout> Well Vader did that for pathos- and it was on an ancient burial ground
[2:07:12] <saraizarai> Being pissed of is an architecture buff
[2:07:18] <Fabpsi_> "sith architect" seems to be a great job
[2:07:22] <ThatGuyThere03> DOES HE STILL THINK YOU'RE A JEDI?

[2:12:36] <$SGrim> Of course I do. I just kicked your shit with it.
[2:12:37] <Fabpsi_> @Cozy90 behind pats picture in the bottom right corner. still the best place for the camera
[2:12:40] <Rageflayer> @luftraumm1 Not really, he just 'escapes' before you kill him and he returns in the Revan expansion which also has a mediocre ending
[2:12:40] <KaitlynnHere> I think he likes it

[2:13:20] <+luftraumm1> @rageflayer oh why did I expect SW to have good narrative?
[2:13:20] <+SocialMisfitGamer> I am just waiting for the option that says "I have been evil the WHOLE TIME!" and for Kreia to slowly realize....."oh shit, you are evil."
[2:13:22] <TourettesPlays> He was like a GI Joe that got tossed in the garbage disposal
[2:13:27] <+megaman_sentinel> what if that was a AOE
[2:13:27] <%Broken_Sonex> @GarbageQueenEllie I actually never thought of that. What WOULD happen
[2:13:27] <%ConLin_Arts_> haha spine go brrrrrrr
[2:13:31] <OldManDeckardCain> tags: mind break
[2:13:31] <%NopeBadguy> If anything, you're probably holding him together better than his own hatred powers
[2:13:47] <KaitlynnHere> Too bad you can’t like pull him apart. That’d be sick AF
[2:13:54] <Rageflayer> @luftraumm1 The Knights of the eternal empire is actually pretty good for what it is

[2:14:12] <+SocialMisfitGamer> "You're a bitch!" that's Jedi talk

[2:15:14] <%Grustamar> Hey, Paige is here! What book did the rude lady swipe from your hands?
[2:15:15] <KaitlynnHere> I don’t think I ever saw that ability
[2:15:52] <Link232> It's not enough that it deals like 200 damage, but it also stuns them for a combat cycle
[2:15:53] <+SocialMisfitGamer> Pull a Shikamaru and bury him in the planet
[2:15:55] <Brandon__Brando> I see what they were going for but man
[2:15:56] <SaltyAzteca> You like it, you love it, you need it!
[2:16:00] <saraizarai> This sure is a tough boss fight
[2:16:01] <Aydarkzero> he seems to be struggling
[2:16:07] <%GarbageQueenEllie> Those are Breaking Benjamin lyrics
[2:16:12] <hollowpiont> You fell like 15 times
[2:16:15] <KaitlynnHere> This is kinda sad
[2:16:17] <%Grustamar> Thicc Mom Chokes Incel For 10 Straight Minutes
[2:16:19] <OwlLightningMage> Sion should melt and come back in his anime is real form
[2:16:20] <%Movemeister> the dialogue is the truest boss fight
[2:16:28] <KaitlynnHere> @hollowpiont I was just about to say that
[2:16:31] <revoltingimp> Bitch, have you looked at yourself? You nasty.
[2:16:35] <Fabpsi_> "5. because i have that sweet stunlock ability. Duh"

[2:17:34] <revoltingimp> i want this game remastered, specifically for that.
[2:17:34] <%Broken_Sonex> They could've, but 14 months
[2:17:34] <Aydarkzero> well that happened i guess
[2:17:41] <tanarath> Not enough time
[2:17:43] <OwlLightningMage> Animations cost money

[2:20:27] <%GarbageQueenEllie> Because fuck yo chicken strips
[2:20:28] <%NopeBadguy> because this ending was rushed
[2:20:32] <Rageflayer> You've been weakened, like Traya foresaw
[2:20:34] <%Undenizen> is... is that the first combat  death in the game?
[2:20:34] <Bust_ER> Goons to get to sion, elites to get to kreia
[2:20:35] <%Broken_Sonex> I think this were the devs realised how OP you would be and beefed up enemies.
[2:20:36] <%Grustamar> Maybe they're tougher to display how tired you're supposed to be now
[2:20:37] <revoltingimp> Sion is looking from the afterlife: I can't belive she died right after punking me

[2:21:07] <%delilah4you> Congrats on Supermurdering Crispy Carl.
[2:21:10] <%NopeBadguy> that's actually doubly hilarious, the idea that you've weakened yourself to go out of way JUST to kill your party yourself
[2:21:41] <KaitlynnHere> Busted
[2:22:05] <%LonePlus_> why are we on the other side
[2:22:08] <%LonePlus_> this is weird
[2:22:11] <%Daxalog> you WILL stun droid
[2:22:12] <Rageflayer> @NopeBadguy Its light side, you sawed them from a disney owned Star wars :3
[2:22:19] <%Daxalog> Now you can screm
[2:22:23] <+luftraumm1> get some dex
[2:22:30] <%Daxalog> is Force scream as busted?
[2:22:44] <Fabpsi_> paige using force scream in the back
[2:22:55] <Fabpsi_> doggo using force eat
[2:22:57] <Spudnacious_Dynasty> This place ain't half as cool as a star forge.
[2:22:58] <%asgard147> "No! MY food Mom!" psaDogchamp
[2:23:17] <%Broken_Sonex> @Daxalog I actually don't know.
[2:23:19] <saraizarai> Is there a point in cleaning out the map?
[2:23:20] <%Daxalog> Oh man. That guy just got sick and then finished off
[2:23:26] <Chuckgofer> ah thats extreme I cant even hear her
[2:23:27] <Rageflayer> Force Storm wouldn't be nearly as brokenly overpowered, if it actually costed anything to cast :(
[2:23:48] <%NopeBadguy> kreia's just in the fucking core like "holy shit she's killing literally every fucking living this on this planet"
[2:23:50] <GarbageQueenEllie> Like a thuggg
[2:23:54] <Nix_Abyss> gotta love Force Storm
[2:24:00] <%Mrbaconator> the fade away
[2:24:00] <Nix_Abyss> OP broke x100
[2:24:10] <Fabpsi_> imagine alll of your friends getting hit by force storm, only you somehow evade the attack...i would just lie down next to them and pretend i am dead too
[2:24:19] <+luftraumm1> sions emitter is pretty dope
[2:24:26] <Rageflayer> Despite, Force wave being objectively better, since it also stunlocks
[2:24:40] <+crazyspartan214> 14 months
[2:24:41] <%NopeBadguy> this is absurd tbh
[2:24:42] <WaitHowDidIGetHere> @nopebadguy “The Force, pls nerf.”
[2:24:43] <KaitlynnHere> It sucks to suck
[2:25:00] <KaitlynnHere> Btw where the fuck did Kreia found all of these force users?
[2:25:09] <%NopeBadguy> trayus feels like a parody of the rest of the game right until you get to the core
[2:25:19] <Fabpsi_> this place is making people stronger with the force
[2:25:20] <Aydarkzero> the force radar
[2:25:22] <Rageflayer> American police departments, duh?
[2:25:22] <+SocialMisfitGamer> Force sense
[2:25:25] <%Daxalog> ?
[2:25:26] <Fabpsi_> so this place helped a little bit out
[2:25:27] <saraizarai> who dis
[2:25:27] <%NopeBadguy> She had two Force Powers, Force Copy and Force Paste
[2:25:30] <%moonmintparadise> hey thats not atton
[2:25:30] <%baronblank> where's atton
[2:25:30] <%GarbageQueenEllie> She found them at K Mart
[2:25:35] <%dekkitout> Uhhh.... holocrons... monkaS
[2:25:36] <%NopeBadguy> whooooo
[2:25:39] <KaitlynnHere> Oh that’s right. The force
[2:25:41] <%dork_doggler> is this a star wars
[2:25:43] <revoltingimp> Now point at his looted corpse and laugh

[2:25:49] <%NopeBadguy> Workbench
[2:25:49] <%baronblank> can you also gas atton
[2:25:53] <%Daxalog> The workbench you found?
[2:26:00] <%Mr_Pylon> why did it do the lighgt side jingle
[2:26:05] <%Cozy90> HERE PAT IS. ROCK HIM LIKE A HURRICANE
[2:26:05] <Fabpsi_> special corpse
[2:26:07] <+Midashu> so powerful, much crystal
[2:26:08] <+SocialMisfitGamer> Does the crystal yell out HURRICANE from SF the movie the game?
[2:26:10] <Fabpsi_> using special force cutscene
[2:26:13] <%Daxalog> Im assuming this is for people who didnt get busted by this point
[2:26:16] <KaitlynnHere> I love it when one of the Disney Star Wars movie literally said that. Like “you got a plan?” “Yeah, the force”
[2:26:23] <%NopeBadguy> Oh, you never got the Light Side Crystal?
[2:26:24] <GarbageQueenEllie> Here I am! Rock you like hurrikaine
[2:26:46] <%vivaldiva> feel the storm
[2:27:00] <Rageflayer> Atton is after Kreia
[2:27:01] <WaitHowDidIGetHere> @garbagequeenellie Rock you like a hurricane rock
[2:27:02] <saraizarai> Can you actually find and kill Atton?
[2:27:11] <%NopeBadguy> Literally the only living things left on this planet are you, Kreia, and Atton
[2:27:20] <KaitlynnHere> Atton baby UwU
[2:27:27] <%Broken_Sonex> @saraizarai I'm starting to think no
[2:27:28] <%dekkitout> "Atton, where ya at? Didn't you always want some quality time alone with me?"
[2:27:32] <Brandon__Brando> why is this so big?

[2:27:39] <KaitlynnHere> That’s probably where Bao Dur was supposed to be

[2:27:49] <%asgard147> limesEvil
[2:27:58] <Spudnacious_Dynasty> OK Atton you got this, go get her

[2:28:45] <faithless_zealot> @Rageflayer +1 to you, that's good
[2:28:48] <WaitHowDidIGetHere> “That is also the incorrect decision.”
[2:28:52] <Chuckgofer> In high school, on a trip to disney, my highschool class had a lightsaber fight.  I won because everyone else killed each other, so i called myself darth cowardace
[2:29:05] <revoltingimp> I need a (Lie) in front of that 3rd option
[2:29:15] <Meekest> Kreia you look more evil than usual

[2:29:42] <ThatGuyThere03> THAT ISN'T IT
[2:29:44] <%isolex_> Her plan is Light Later
[2:29:45] <$Futurecity10> Thats not the plan
[2:29:46] <%GarbageQueenEllie> More than that tho
[2:29:52] <%QueequegTheater> KEIKAKU DOORI
[2:29:53] <%NopeBadguy> That's her plan in Dark Side.
[2:29:54] <+SocialMisfitGamer> Hey Kreia, you know i'm a asshole right?
[2:30:01] <%NopeBadguy> In Light Side, her end goal is different and it's fucking weird.
[2:30:01] <%Broken_Sonex> Then what IS the plan, chat?
[2:30:02] <%coward_man> psaWrong
[2:30:07] <+SocialMisfitGamer> Bark
[2:30:08] <+Midashu> Just murdering everyone
[2:30:14] <@commanderclaw> @Broken_Sonex Destroying the force itself
[2:30:19] <+BananaSlammuh> @Broken_Sonex The Reapers
[2:30:20] <KaitlynnHere> So her dirty work?
[2:30:26] <revoltingimp> bitch you want to kill the force, probably killing more than the sith lords would
[2:30:27] <+Dova573> Isint she trying to rid the universe of the force
[2:30:28] <%TwoStarPlayersNik> What if they made like a Nazi sithlord and called him Darth Hotler
[2:30:28] <JoshManVGH> Guys I think she used us!
[2:30:30] <+Dova573> ?
[2:30:32] <%cade_calrayn> Sorry, Pat, there's already a Darth Pat - Traya
[2:30:33] <%QueequegTheater> Ah yes, "reapers"
[2:30:35] <%dekkitout> You bought it, the Jedi bought it, even my students bought it!
[2:30:37] <%cade_calrayn> *Darth Spite
[2:30:41] <%NopeBadguy> In Light Side, she basically frames her end goal as using your Force Wound as a jumping point to basically kill the Force entirely. @PatStaresAt
[2:30:43] <%Broken_Sonex> @BananaSlammuh I like this answer better.
[2:30:44] <%coward_man> @Broken_Sonex the la le lu le lo
[2:30:52] <+Midashu> "I made the biggest serial killer, to kill all those other serial killers!"
[2:30:58] <+Dova573> I will always oppose that plan
[2:31:08] <%QueequegTheater> get it it rhymes with betrayer, give awards pls
[2:31:09] <%cade_calrayn> Wait, who loved the Exile?
[2:31:11] <%GarbageQueenEllie> Politics
[2:31:11] <%coward_man> because darkside
[2:31:14] <%cade_calrayn> who?
[2:31:15] <%Broken_Sonex> Yeah, i never got that.
[2:31:16] <Aydarkzero> that's dumb
[2:31:16] <%dekkitout> Because sith
[2:31:16] <+crazyspartan214> because the forces?
[2:31:16] <%Mr_Pylon> because evil space magic
[2:31:20] <%JumboCrunchies> 'Cause shuddup Darkside
[2:31:21] <Rageflayer> Because withour edge, the world is flat
[2:31:21] <OldManDeckardCain> "for lulz"
[2:31:23] <saraizarai> I assume that's a "nature abhors a vacuum" thing
[2:31:23] <%moonmintparadise> woohoo star wars logic
[2:31:24] <+cade_calrayn> Is Traya talking about Kreia?
[2:31:24] <$RealThiele> chaotic evil society
[2:31:25] <+SocialMisfitGamer> There are always assholes out there
[2:31:26] <+Dova573> because GREED?
[2:31:26] <+SergeEXE> Not as bad as Darth Andedu
[2:31:27] <Spudnacious_Dynasty> Kreia had shitty parents.
[2:31:30] <%dekkitout> This is her rule of one (guy)
[2:31:31] <KaitlynnHere> The force, that’s why
[2:31:36] <%TwoStarPlayersNik> Because the only way a Traya would die, would be through betrayal lol
[2:31:39] <+BananaSlammuh> only a sith believe in absolutes
[2:31:39] <%moonmintparadise> "She didnt say that"  "IT IS UNSAID !"
[2:31:40] <%Grustamar> Star Wars is just all of the concepts from Dune but dumbed down and misunderstood.
[2:31:43] <OwlLightningMage> Because managers will always betray their employees
[2:31:44] <revoltingimp> Cause if you don't betray, what is there? Trust? Fuck off with that fake shit.
[2:31:49] <%NopeBadguy> Oh she frames it here too
[2:31:52] <%GarbageQueenEllie> THAT is the plan
[2:31:52] <tanarath> Pat, the force is evil to Kreia, so she believes she can stop it.
[2:31:55] <Meekest> I mean she's not wrong
[2:32:01] <%QueequegTheater> squeak squeak
[2:32:01] <%NopeBadguy> I HATE THE FORCE. I HATE THE SCRIPTS THE FORCE WRITES.
[2:32:02] <%JumboCrunchies> Thats actually super fair
[2:32:02] <%JohnAtDawn> This is just the author talking now
[2:32:04] <%cade_calrayn> she is the true Darth Nihilus
[2:32:07] <OwlLightningMage> She's not wrong
[2:32:10] <%cade_calrayn> she's a Nihilist
[2:32:12] <+SocialMisfitGamer> Is she really blaming the force for her bullshit?
[2:32:12] <Ipsenscastle> The fucking thing of Darths being called the last half of bad person words is the most embarrassing thing in Star Wars
[2:32:16] <tanarath> Yeah, Pat
[2:32:17] <Blank9> but exile can use the force, so who cares
[2:32:19] <%QueequegTheater> @PatStaresAt Wouldn't killing the Force kill all life in the galaxy?
[2:32:20] <Ids560> Kreia shut up about the bear and the bull
[2:32:24] <%TwoStarPlayersNik> Pat you've worked retail, you know there will always be a Darth Traya
[2:32:25] <baronblank> curious

[2:32:44] <+Midashu> defeat the poison with poison
[2:32:45] <+luftraumm1> fuck the force
[2:32:48] <%cade_calrayn> @QueequegTheater yes, and also no - the Exile and Kreia existed without it for a time
[2:32:49] <OwlLightningMage> The pizza is really loud
[2:32:50] <JoshManVGH> "Because, Exile, We live in a society!"
[2:32:51] <+ReallyBigRocks> Ben Sh'Piro
[2:32:51] <%GarbageQueenEllie> oooof SHADE
[2:32:52] <+Dova573> People will still be shitty with or without the force
[2:32:58] <WaitHowDidIGetHere> “If you hate the Force so much, then why don’t you marry it?”
[2:33:03] <KaitlynnHere> If you’re so against society then why did I see you at Starbucks?
[2:33:09] <+Dova573> at least we get magic bs with the force

[2:33:28] <+cafefunk> I dont get nihilism- why is life meaningless just because its temporary?
[2:33:31] <GarbageQueenEllie> She is the Space Ubermensch
[2:33:38] <%TwoStarPlayersNik> ToiletPaperKorriban
[2:33:49] <+projectmanatees> god imagine if they let us do her plan
[2:33:52] <OwlLightningMage> life is meaningless because it's pointless and random
[2:33:52] <%Daxalog> You got off of drugs so hard that every dealer couldnt recover the same. All blame you.
[2:33:57] <Chuckgofer> You dumped the force so hard the force keeps crying to foce users about you
[2:34:01] <Meekest> I hate this part of the Sith thing
[2:34:02] <+luftraumm1> @cafefunk that's a shallow way of looking at nihilism
[2:34:04] <Chuckgofer> Kreia liked that
[2:34:14] <+coward_man> that was a grim sound
[2:34:15] <+SocialMisfitGamer> We're gonna kill each other, AND YOU'RE GONNA LIKE IT
[2:34:16] <%cade_calrayn> fatty says no
[2:34:19] <Aydarkzero> oh no
[2:34:21] <%Broken_Sonex> @cafefunk Because nihilist never got laid.
[2:34:23] <%QueequegTheater> YEYEYEYE
[2:34:23] <+Midashu> Stab me or I'll stab myself!
[2:34:25] <+crazyspartan214> LET GOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOO
[2:34:27] <revoltingimp> Zangief is Darth Phat
[2:34:28] <+SocialMisfitGamer> FIGHT THE MANAGER
[2:34:28] <GarbageQueenEllie> Here we go
[2:34:28] <OwlLightningMage> That sound is so gross LUL
[2:34:30] <%isolex_> OH NO
[2:34:31] <%cade_calrayn> oh lord..... Pt....
[2:34:32] <KaitlynnHere> I heard that
[2:34:33] <+MidnightBurst12> HYPE
[2:34:33] <tanarath> R E Q D Y
[2:34:34] <%QueequegTheater> LUL
[2:34:35] <Zebroneath> Heck yeah
[2:34:35] <+NopeBadguy> Time to choke out this old woman in a telekinectic choke hold
[2:34:36] <OwlLightningMage> OVERCONFIDENCE AGAIN PAT
[2:34:38] <+cafefunk> So whats the essence of nihilism @luftraumm1
[2:34:38] <%DianaTheAscian> LETS GOOOOOO
[2:34:41] <%JumboCrunchies> WOOOO
[2:34:42] <+MassConnect> waste all the force
[2:34:42] <$SGrim> Nice
[2:34:42] <+ReallyBigRocks> Wow so EPIC
[2:34:43] <+crazyspartan214> YEYEYEYEYEYEYEYE
[2:34:46] <Sotetsu> So dramatic!
[2:34:47] <Ids560> crunch that old lady's bones
[2:34:48] <KaitlynnHere> Zangeif makes all sorts of interesting noises
[2:34:48] <Zebroneath> Kreia not having a good time  LUL
[2:34:49] <Aydarkzero> the force is so stupid
[2:34:53] <%dekkitout> Wait-
[2:34:55] <%asgard147> CRUSH HER NECK limesEvil
[2:34:56] <Tracazoid> Today we learned choking>lightning
[2:34:59] <KaitlynnHere> BIG DRAMA
[2:35:00] <%dekkitout> Where are her summon swords
[2:35:04] <+SocialMisfitGamer> YEAAAAAHHHH
[2:35:06] <+luftraumm1> in most doctrines of nihilism life is simply meaningless, not because of its length, but mainly because there's no ultimate meaning for anything
[2:35:06] <%QueequegTheater> Wait what about the lightsabers
[2:35:11] <OwlLightningMage> second phase
[2:35:15] <+oktavia_von> more epic than the last movie
[2:35:16] <%Cozy90> SICK COMBO
[2:35:16] <Sotetsu> Whew, what a fight!
[2:35:17] <+projectmanatees> kriea is gona rage quit this match she didnt get to move
[2:35:31] <OwlLightningMage> It's a dark souls boss second phase
[2:35:32] <GarbageQueenEllie> YEEEAAAAH
[2:35:33] <%TwoStarPlayersNik> Dante vs. Vergil got nothing on this boss fight
[2:35:33] <$QueequegTheater> there they are
[2:35:35] <revoltingimp> Really puts into perspective how unoptimized Vader's fighting style is since he doesn't just choke everything smh
[2:35:39] <%isolex_> SUMMONED SWORDS
[2:35:40] <Aydarkzero> wut
[2:35:42] <Aydarkzero> WHAT
[2:35:42] <%dekkitout> Oh, there's the summon swords
[2:35:42] <%JoshManVGH> @cafefunk It's more about accepting how you will never be as big of a deal on the universe as you think you will be. So instead live the kind of life you would be happy living if you were to live only that life forever.
[2:35:45] <+luftraumm1> @cafefunk depends on what you call nihilism
[2:35:46] <+cafefunk> What about subjective meaning? @luftraumm1
[2:35:46] <%cade_calrayn> oh fuck yeah THIS
[2:35:47] <+Dova573> NOW THIS IS THEB BEST
[2:35:51] <%Movemeister> yup
[2:35:51] <%asgard147> limesPoggers
[2:35:51] <OwlLightningMage> SUMMON FUCKING SWORDS
[2:35:53] <Spudnacious_Dynasty> Woolie loved this too
[2:35:57] <%coward_man> I would fucking LOVE for this to be in a movie
[2:36:00] <samcast1> Is it bad that this is only part of the playthrough I've seen so far.
[2:36:00] <ThatGuyThere03> because it's actually a pain in the ass
[2:36:03] <$RealThiele> Infinite saberworks
[2:36:04] <OldManDeckardCain> oh yeah, woolie was cumming all over because of this LUL
[2:36:05] <%tuesti> i imagine it takes a lot to do it
[2:36:07] <%SvenHolgersson> NO BUT TOSS ROCKS THO
[2:36:09] <+tweedler92> literally all the time
[2:36:10] <+Midashu> just make a ball of lightsabers and throw it around
[2:36:10] <%SvenHolgersson> SHUDDUP
[2:36:11] <Chuckgofer> cuz its fucking hard
[2:36:14] <KaitlynnHere> yea this is KEKW
[2:36:15] <%GarbageQueenEllie> Only Kreia deserves the clout
[2:36:15] <OwlLightningMage> it's really hard
[2:36:16] <Teras_ode> unlimited saber works
[2:36:17] <%dekkitout> One weird trick, Lucas HATES it!
[2:36:17] <Rageflayer> she summoned an invisible Grievous
[2:36:21] <%SvenHolgersson> BUT ROCKS THO
[2:36:21] <Chuckgofer> no its hard
[2:36:23] <+SocialMisfitGamer> SUMMONED SABERS
[2:36:23] <ThatGuyThere03> because it's fucking insane pat
[2:36:24] <OwlLightningMage> no they can't
[2:36:25] <%QueequegTheater> @PatStaresAt Regular swords are only a pound or two, lightsabers are probably a couple ounces
[2:36:27] <+avidavidity> Shaak ti did it a little bit in the original clone wars cartoon. I assume it takes high concentration.
[2:36:28] <+tweedler92> like when Anakin cut of Douku's hands
[2:36:30] <%Mr_Pylon> It's more honourable to throw a rock, like you're Killer Croc
[2:36:31] <+ReallyBigRocks> There's at least one boss that kinda does this in Fallen Order
[2:36:31] <$SGrim> Insert: *some bullshit lore*
[2:36:32] <Link232> If Grevious can six-wield sabers you can summon sword sabers
[2:36:32] <OwlLightningMage> It's really really hard
[2:36:33] <+luftraumm1> @cafefunk subjective meaning is just that: subjective
[2:36:39] <Chuckgofer> It requires like 9x the fgocus
[2:36:47] <mihokspawn> Cause Traya is actually THAT good of a manager
[2:36:47] <%YakumoYomi> It probably requires a lot of finesse, and would leave you open you getting shot/stabbed
[2:36:57] <%GarbageQueenEllie> Maybe use lightsabor?
[2:36:57] <+MassConnect> correct me if I'm wrong but force wave can actually stun the sabers
[2:36:58] <saraizarai> got some drugs, pat?
[2:36:58] <sendart> Funnels go!
[2:36:59] <KaitlynnHere> Don’t die! Then you’ll have to do the dialogue all over again
[2:37:02] <+FingaLights> Why would it be hard?
[2:37:05] <OwlLightningMage> The problem is that it constantly uses force energy
[2:37:07] <%QueequegTheater> Wait what happened to the other party members? ded?
[2:37:13] <saraizarai> Also, that's just the new FFXIV class
[2:37:13] <+Midashu> this part was always rough
[2:37:14] <%Cozy90> not usable by wookies
[2:37:16] <+Kitafin> go get her
[2:37:18] <Chuckgofer> Oh no, not more amazing dialogue
[2:37:20] <%TwoStarPlayersNik> I mean you can still hold a lightsaber, AND have telekinetic sabres as well
[2:37:21] <%Broken_Sonex> Man, this argument with the manager is getting out of hand
[2:37:21] <+luftraumm1> @cafefunk an interesting introduction to this question is the work of Camus, although he is not a nihilist he studied the topic
[2:37:22] <Shining_Armor> Because the force is hard to use in the middle of almost being killed. Remember that a force users greatest weakness is fear.
[2:37:23] <%Puhff> It's probably really difficult to do with any degree of finesse
[2:37:26] <%isolex_> @QueequegTheater big dead
[2:37:32] <tanarath> Ka Rhen killed the other pay members
[2:37:32] <$Futurecity10> >why doesnt every jedi do this. Alright, can you juggle 3 balls without looking at them?
[2:37:37] <OwlLightningMage> Every second is like doing three force chokes
[2:37:40] <+klutch02> @Midashu i think thid is a forced solo fight
[2:37:41] <+cafefunk> I dont see a problem with subjective meaning
[2:37:48] <%Mr_Pylon> Pat gassed them @QueequegTheater
[2:37:56] <KaitlynnHere> @futurecity10 I mean with practice
[2:38:11] <+NopeBadguy> @PatStaresAt It probably requires an intense amount of *** wield them as actual independent weapons. Lightsaber throw is a really simple version of telekinetic lightsaber combat.
[2:38:11] <%Daxalog> Now your thinking with portals
[2:38:13] <%GarbageQueenEllie> They're even PURPLE
[2:38:13] <Rageflayer> Zerg the boss, owo
[2:38:14] <xMaSterKeef420bluntNinjAx> DPS race
[2:38:15] <+cafefunk> Whether you do something with your life you feel satisfy with or lay around miserable, it comes to the same conclusion of death, right?
[2:38:16] <OwlLightningMage> It uses a ton of energy and requires a lot of finesse. It's not practical for everyone to use
[2:38:22] <%QueequegTheater> wow
[2:38:26] <+FingaLights> Just have them twirl
[2:38:27] <+Midashu> you should run around the arena a bit
[2:38:34] <+luftraumm1> @cafefunk there's no problem with subjective meaning, if you can find it, awesome, if you can't then that's an interesting situation
[2:38:35] <Chuckgofer> Like maybe yoda could do it
[2:38:50] <Chuckgofer> and that would make more sense with "size matters not"
[2:39:04] <$LittleMiniTinyJosh> Cheer500 Thanks for advice about the laptop stuff Pat, but if getting a gaming laptop is not really a good idea then what can I do to get started into PC or what's even a good PC to have? I both don't own and have the space for a table and a monitor, so it's probably better just to hook up the PC to the my TV right? Sorry I was born as a console caveman so i'm not sure if it works the same way as a console and i'm too dumb to understand all the techno babble when building a PC.
[2:39:04] <%coward_man> YOU DIDN'T WIN!
[2:39:11] <%Broken_Sonex> Chuck her in
[2:39:12] <Aydarkzero> k
[2:39:13] <KaitlynnHere> @chuckgofer I think yoga prefers doing back flips
[2:39:13] <revoltingimp> Nice
[2:39:16] <Zebroneath> I'm amazed, option 1 is still there at all
[2:39:18] <%TwoStarPlayersNik> Everyone saying that it would be impossible to do, are ignoring that Kreia is literally doing it in front of our eyes and it's fine
[2:39:19] <%NopeBadguy> GOODBYE JOJO
[2:39:21] <%Broken_Sonex> There she weeeeeeeee
[2:39:22] <%GarbageQueenEllie> Oh wow skipped that dialogue
[2:39:22] <vamvas37> woooh!
[2:39:26] <%Broken_Sonex> Wheeeeeeeeeee
[2:39:27] <%Daxalog> This bitch empty? Yeet?
[2:39:28] <%Mrbaconator> MANAGER TALKED TO
[2:39:29] <Chuckgofer> check out /r/build a pc on reddit
[2:39:30] <KaitlynnHere> Well that was quick
[2:39:31] <%moonmintparadise> oh hey they did the thing
[2:39:32] <+Delenay> its fine, she is cloned
[2:39:33] <KaitlynnHere> Welp
[2:39:36] <%tuesti> i've never seen that cutscene dajkfhkalfa
[2:39:37] <+unhuggable1> fast
[2:39:38] <Blank9> she survived, like palpatine
[2:39:38] <%Arancet> "i love that you beat me" "um, ok, die now"
[2:39:42] <OwlLightningMage> Manager defeated
[2:39:44] <%moonmintparadise> NOOOOO
[2:39:44] <MayorRev> The manager has been killed
[2:39:46] <Meekest> PLEASE kill him
[2:39:46] <+SvenHolgersson> PALPY NOOOOOOOOOOOOO

[2:39:58] <+luftraumm1> @cafefunk not necessarily,  why do anything? why NOT do anything? you can choose any of the two,  but why?
[2:39:58] <Daxalog> He IS the pilot
[2:39:58] <+crazyspartan214> fuck off Aton
[2:39:58] <+cafefunk> @luftraumm1 do you have subjective meaning to your life?
[2:40:00] <%Movemeister> kill him D:
[2:40:00] <%GarbageQueenEllie> This ending is SO tonedeaf
[2:40:01] <vamvas37> lol no final dialogue to explain everything
[2:40:01] <%Mr_Pylon> no, kill him
[2:40:03] <OwlLightningMage> KILL HIM NOW

[2:40:20] <Brandon__Brando> thats it?
[2:40:20] <%QueequegTheater> @PatStaresAt He doesn't care
[2:40:21] <%baronblank> why would he
[2:40:22] <+Midashu> he ran away, how could he know LUL
[2:40:22] <Meekest> I guess not
[2:40:23] <%SvenHolgersson> Did we miss a scene there
[2:40:25] <%coward_man> I don't think he cares
[2:40:25] <%SvenHolgersson> We had to
[2:40:26] <Chuckgofer> doubt he carea
[2:40:26] <%Divryne> No don't worry about it.
[2:40:26] <%Daxalog> Hes probably not gonna ask
[2:40:28] <%dekkitout> Does he *care*
[2:40:30] <+unhuggable1> wow... thats the ending...
[2:40:30] <%asgard147> nope
[2:40:35] <%QueequegTheater> He's evil
[2:40:38] <+cafefunk> @luftraumm1 because our bodies and brain enjoy feelings of happiness more than feelings of misery

[2:41:07] <KaitlynnHere> lmao
[2:41:08] <OldManDeckardCain> kotor 2 is such a great game Kappa
[2:41:08] <Ipsenscastle> that SUCKED
[2:41:08] <$Futurecity10> Man who killed everyone and didnt talk to anyone confused on why game doesnt make sense
[2:41:09] <RawrFatcat> wow light side version of that is far better
[2:41:09] <%TwoStarPlayersNik> you saved everyone hurray
[2:41:10] <$QueequegTheater> KOTOR 2, SO GOOD
[2:41:10] <%dekkitout> Just Talk didn't happen
[2:41:10] <%vivaldiva> "whatever lets get breakfast"
[2:41:13] <MayorRev> YOU DID IT

[2:41:13] <+crazyspartan214> I DON'T GET IT!!!!!!!!
[2:41:14] <logothete2401> you chose the dark side ending
[2:41:15] <Chuckgofer> yes
[2:41:15] <%coward_man> man fuck Dark Side gets fucked on story
[2:41:16] <%NopeBadguy> @PatStaresAt That's Atton's ending if he wins his Sion fight. He dies after you kill Kreia if he loses his Sion fight.
[2:41:16] <Aydarkzero> don't worry about it!
[2:41:16] <+luftraumm1> there's nothing to get
[2:41:16] <Spudnacious_Dynasty> You saved the galaxy
[2:41:17] <+doctor_kels> You skipped most of the dialogue
[2:41:18] <KaitlynnHere> And that’s it
[2:41:18] <@commanderclaw> You lost a fuckton of dialogue thanks to just killing Kriea rather than talking to her
[2:41:19] <+bulletzok> ya
[2:41:20] <%Divryne> YOU SITHED THE LORDS.
[2:41:20] <%Fooguwu> the light side version explains more
[2:41:21] <%TwoStarPlayersNik> pat you are now the Sith Lords
[2:41:21] <saraizarai> 14 months, man
[2:41:21] <narusao> KEKW

[2:41:23] <%Foxsploder> WE WERE THE SHIT LORDS ALL ALONG
[2:41:23] <%asgard147> No it's fine though
[2:41:24] <%MidnightBurst12> dark side ending still bad
[2:41:24] <Shining_Armor> Only a sith learns in abslutes.
[2:41:24] <gothicdoubling> you skipped the dialogue that's why you don't get it
[2:41:24] <KaitlynnHere> You did it
[2:41:25] <+dante_must_die_exe> YE YE KOTOR 2
[2:41:26] <%QueequegTheater> WHAT AN AMAZING GAME KappaHD Kappa KappaHD Kappa
[2:41:27] <%Undenizen> you were supposed to ask her a bunch of shit
[2:41:27] <Teras_ode> did pat skip the final conversation with Kreia?
[2:41:28] <faithless_zealot> PAt, YOU DID... IT! YOU DID IT!
[2:41:28] <KaitlynnHere> You beat the game
[2:41:29] <Blank9> in light side, she gives epilogues to each character
[2:41:29] <$Futurecity10> Maybe go light side
[2:41:30] <%Puhff> And that's why Light side is canon
[2:41:33] <%tuesti> yes you did
[2:41:35] <Blank9> by seeing into the future as she dies
[2:41:36] <+crazyspartan214> 14 MONTHS!!!!!
[2:41:37] <Spudnacious_Dynasty> Nice force echo, dude
[2:41:37] <%moonmintparadise> you just got KOTOR-ed
[2:41:38] <%GarbageQueenEllie> "DIE"--
[2:41:38] <KaitlynnHere> It’s done
[2:41:39] <Chuckgofer> atton is your apprentice
[2:41:41] <+Midashu> kreia would've given exposition, but she wanted to die sooooo bad
[2:41:41] <KaitlynnHere> Book closed
[2:41:41] <%QueequegTheater> @PatStaresAt Pat, you won
[2:41:41] <tanarath> @patstaresat maybe don't skip?
[2:41:44] <Teras_ode> it's light side only?
[2:41:44] <+luftraumm1> should have him die to sion
[2:41:44] <faithless_zealot> IT HAS BEEN DONE
[2:41:45] <%dekkitout> You killed her than left- that thing smart Aleks ask why people don't just do that
[2:41:46] <+MassConnect> killing the party skips dialogue
[2:41:46] <RiverBirch> You
[2:41:48] <KaitlynnHere> Movie ended
[2:41:49] <+Kitafin> you skipped final dialogue
[2:41:49] <$Futurecity10> You basically told everyone to go fuck themselves and didnt ask anything
[2:41:50] <narusao> we missed the ending dialog! start over!
[2:41:50] <RiverBirch> did it
[2:41:50] <vamvas37> restored content mod is overhyped
[2:41:51] <%BallerSwagBro9k> LIGHT SIDE ENDING IS A BIT MORE FLESHED OUT
[2:41:52] <faithless_zealot> IT DID YOU BY PAT
[2:41:52] <KaitlynnHere> Credits rolled
[2:41:55] <+klutch02> YEAH you did skip ALOT of diualogue
[2:41:56] <%NopeBadguy> @PatStaresAt Kreia has a ton more dialogue but you told her to just die and she just fell over
[2:41:57] <+bulletzok> light side characters just disappear
[2:41:58] <CanSnake> she has more to say if you don't tell her to die
[2:42:01] <%QueequegTheater> @PatStaresAt Light Side ending is less confusing, do a LS run
[2:42:02] <$Memdosu> yeah you did
[2:42:02] <$Futurecity10> Dark side is not for story
[2:42:03] <+cafefunk> @luftraumm1 i mean theres more to it than just biology, culture and society also alter how we react to our chemicals
[2:42:04] <Blank9> she'd give a character-by-character epilogue
[2:42:04] <%Broken_Sonex> Pretty sure you could ask Kreia to see the future @PatStaresAt
[2:42:04] <%moonmintparadise> bad ending
[2:42:10] <%BallerSwagBro9k> @patstaresat Being Dark Side makes you miss some stuff
[2:42:13] <%TwoStarPlayersNik> Pat the Dark Side ending is just broken, sorry
[2:42:13] <%moonmintparadise> literally the baddest of endings in every way
[2:42:18] <Chuckgofer> you and atton are the two
[2:42:20] <TwoStarPlayersNik> they ran out of money
[2:42:23] <+Caidezes> You skipped all the dialogue. Restart the whole game.
[2:42:23] <+dante_must_die_exe> Hey we got some time left
[2:42:24] <OwlLightningMage> Go watch Woolie's ending, I guess LUL
[2:42:24] <CrypticMochi> Pretty sure that’s why light side is canon, you cut off so much in a dark side run
[2:42:30] <%dekkitout> "I don't get it, why not skip the talking and kill teh villain"
[2:42:30] <%tuesti> the ending still sucks but yeah there is dialogue
[2:42:31] <Chuckgofer> ZA WARUDO
[2:42:35] <+luftraumm1> @cafefunk of course,  but is that "meaning"?
[2:42:36] <EuropanLamprey> Time for Crazy Talk: Bites the Dust aka reloading
[2:42:37] <%NopeBadguy> @PatStaresAt Atton dies in the ending if he loses his Sion fight as well.
[2:42:39] <%BallerSwagBro9k> Dark Side ending has way less stuff
[2:42:40] <+FingaLights> Darkside sucks :(
[2:42:42] <KaitlynnHere> Ask Kreia to lick your butt
[2:42:53] <Brandon__Brando> even tho why would following her order skip the ending
[2:42:53] <arussoltzm> Tells Kreia to die...Kriea dies...surprise pat face
[2:43:01] <Chuckgofer> Reload play as Karen for good
[2:43:02] <prisonsphere> go back, spare your companions. they have no future cause theyre all dead for you

[2:43:21] <revoltingimp> really wringing that neck like a wet towel
[2:43:24] <KaitlynnHere> This really does break the game

[2:43:40] <%coward_man> you forgot to buff yourself
[2:43:41] <+cafefunk> @luftraumm1 thats something ive thought about a lot recently, and ive come to accept that there is no objective meaning we are here, but we have our own subjective meanings, and if thats all there is, why not value it?

[2:43:57] <+OhioNitsud> CrazyTalk
[2:44:14] <%QueequegTheater> Because they're cool
[2:44:14] <%coward_man> cause Revan cool
[2:44:15] <%Broken_Sonex> Purple is a good color
[2:44:19] <Chuckgofer> Shes good and evil
[2:44:20] <Shining_Armor> Cuz she's an old style pimp
[2:44:20] <%dekkitout> Because
[2:44:22] <Chuckgofer> red and blue
[2:44:23] <%GarbageQueenEllie> Because purple's your favorite and she loooves you
[2:44:26] <Aydarkzero> isn't purple both light and dark?
[2:44:26] <+topiodonk> stolen sabers like grievous?
[2:44:27] <SharkTankAgito> LUL
[2:44:29] <ARDM112> Cause she's cool like Revan and is cooler than  other Sith
[2:44:30] <Rageflayer> Its cause she sees the future and calls upon Mace windu to help her
[2:44:31] <OwlLightningMage> Blue and Red
[2:44:31] <%Broken_Sonex> It's a noble colour
[2:44:36] <%MidnightBurst12> some sith used purple
[2:44:37] <%moonmintparadise> jesus pats not this debate again
[2:44:40] <OwlLightningMage> light and dark blue and red
[2:44:41] <+doctor_kels> @cafefunk congrats on passing grade 12 philosophy
[2:44:49] <$Quiet__Viking> purple is grey not dark or light
[2:44:51] <+friedcrispy> purple lightsabers are generally shared with those that have a light and dark affinity
[2:44:51] <+luftraumm1> @cafefunk at the end of the day nihilism is not just another word for pessimism, or melancholy or depression, it is an extensive dialogue on the nature of meaning, not just reasons on why to keep living, those are personal choices
[2:44:58] <+MassConnect> maybe they *aren't* purple
[2:45:11] <%moonmintparadise> purple because she loves that berry crunch bc it reminds her of her bones
[2:45:20] <%GarbageQueenEllie> @doctor_kels My K12 didn't even have philosophy, stupid asshole schoolboard.
[2:45:30] <clintsterlock> Hello fellow whores

[2:47:02] <saraizarai> So Atton
[2:47:06] <%QueequegTheater> literally only Atton
[2:47:06] <$RealThiele> LUL
[2:47:07] <%JumboCrunchies> That is a non answer. Just say you don't know, Kreia.
[2:47:08] <+topiodonk> they needed a teacher and now THEY ARE DEAD
[2:47:09] <baronblank> who is they, only atton is alive
[2:47:10] <ARDM112> Wait, that's the part from light side ending
[2:47:12] <%Mr_Pylon> game still assuming Jedi

[2:47:17] <+Midashu> Dead future Jedi teachers
[2:47:28] <TourettesPlays> So gassing your party is a restored content mod thing, so Kreia has no reaction to it it seems
[2:47:43] <%QueequegTheater> So he becomes another Nihilus?
[2:47:45] <rosemon5001> they will become zombie jedis hmhm

[2:48:02] <+topiodonk> damn kreia

[2:48:42] <revoltingimp> boy i sure hope there is a satisfying payoff to that story hook!
[2:48:43] <%QueequegTheater> You must go to the terrible sequel novel
[2:48:43] <Blank9> the sequel that did happen but don't think of it
[2:48:44] <OwlLightningMage> Play the sequel
[2:48:45] <%MelBrooksKA> "You want to **** Atton, don't you?"
[2:48:48] <%cade_calrayn> Revan was a MAN, excuse me
[2:48:54] <%cade_calrayn> Mullet Revan Supremacy

[2:48:59] <OwlLightningMage> sequel is gonna happen any day now
[2:49:02] <Ipsenscastle> is she talking about the Shit Lords?
[2:49:03] <+topiodonk> there is swtor...
[2:49:11] <+cafefunk> @luftraumm1 and i appreciate your kind words, but i accept how much i dont know
[2:49:12] <narusao> D:
[2:49:13] <+SocialMisfitGamer> She's rambling at this point
[2:49:16] <%Broken_Sonex> "I see in the far future......a mouse.....it is horrifying." @PatStaresAt
[2:49:20] <+yourfriendtusks> sith is a state of mind
[2:49:21] <Rageflayer> @cade_calrayn  Wrong, Revan was definitely a foxy woman with 2 lightsabers
[2:49:31] <vamvas37> Cant wait for KOTOR3 for the Exile and Revan team up
[2:49:33] <%Daxalog> Further expanded upon in the hit MMO TOR
[2:49:35] <%cade_calrayn> was this dialogue in the original game?
[2:49:39] <narusao> maybe the real sith is the friends we made along the way
[2:49:45] <%GarbageQueenEllie> That's bullshit
[2:49:47] <%dekkitout> @vamvas37 About that team up...

[2:50:06] <+luftraumm1> @cafefunk that's not stupidity, perhaps you just haven't found a source of knowledge and dialogue
[2:50:07] <+crazyspartan214> the force?

[2:50:27] <%Daxalog> 14 minths
[2:50:27] <+topiodonk> he ran like a bitch
[2:50:29] <%Broken_Sonex> CARTH THE GUY THAT'S DEAD IN THIS PLAYTHROUGH?!
[2:50:30] <CanSnake> oops
[2:50:32] <%baronblank> was he dead before she left?
[2:50:34] <%GarbageQueenEllie> Carth is always dead, forever
[2:50:36] <%QueequegTheater> @PatStaresAt No, he was abandoned. Carth never dies on screen
[2:50:37] <%BallerSwagBro9k> THE GAME TREATS HIM AS ALIVE BECAUSE LIGHT SIDE
[2:50:41] <%NopeBadguy> @PatStaresAt It's impossible to kill Carth unless you romance him as Female Revan
[2:50:55] <+luftraumm1> remember that the sith are red lizard men
[2:50:57] <Smokin_Fish> you gotta kill yourself to become a force ghost and go double kill Carth just to be sure
[2:51:01] <+corrosivePaladin> I cant believe she ran off to fight the Darkness on her own
[2:51:02] <KaitlynnHere> He’s not dead, he ran away, remember?
[2:51:06] <GustauveVIII> @patstaresat The game's ending is entirely dependent on your alignment. If you cheat and switch your alignment from dark side to light side, the ending plays as if you were light.
[2:51:06] <%dekkitout> The Republic will fall, then recover, then fall, and the wheels will turn
[2:51:26] <KaitlynnHere> He left a 12 year old behind like a true hero

[2:52:46] <narusao> of course! it all makes sense now
[2:52:47] <+luftraumm1> @cafefunk maybe you are an absurdist, try reading about it, or can be very interesting
[2:52:48] <%GarbageQueenEllie> Soooo broken
[2:52:48] <CanSnake> this is the true light later
[2:52:49] <vamvas37> all this ground work just for rey to fumble her way to killing the emperor

[2:53:03] <%moonmintparadise> you not only killed every npc, you killed the games logic

[2:53:12] <OldManDeckardCain> kotor 2 is so much better than Kotor 1 Kappa
[2:53:16] <%BallerSwagBro9k> There's literally no conclusion to Dark Side. It just gives you the light side conclusion mostly
[2:53:19] <%Broken_Sonex> The only way to play this game is light side male it seems.
[2:53:19] <%rkbinder> stack overflow
[2:53:20] <%UvBenServed> So Pat DID do "dark now, light later"

[2:54:08] <+SocialMisfitGamer> You did it, Pat. You killed the manager

[2:54:29] <%JoshManVGH> It's the "Restored Content Mod" not the "Restored GOOD Content Mod"
[2:54:29] <tanarath> Also, some of the restored content is garbage.
[2:54:31] <$Futurecity10> @Brandon__Brando Go to woolies playthrough, dark side isnt a good run through of the game
[2:54:32] <%Mr_Pylon> HK is alive, so net win!
[2:54:39] <%Undenizen> WOOO.
[2:54:39] <+crazyspartan214> 14 MONTHS!!!
[2:54:41] <Zebroneath> This game is fascinating but then vomits on being the actual video game.
[2:54:42] <+Midashu> so she really was just a crazy old lady, talking about dead people being alive
[2:54:44] <Teras_ode> 14 months
[2:54:46] <OwlLightningMage> So which Kotor game is better, Pat? LUL
[2:54:47] <CrypticMochi> What a confusing mess compared to the light side
[2:54:47] <saraizarai> Some content probably shouldn't be restored
[2:54:50] <+OhioNitsud> what're we playin next dad?
[2:54:52] <KaiserMario> @PatStaresAt But seriously, what did you expect?
[2:54:55] <%Gloom_Tangerine> There’s a line where she predicts jango fett being killed by mace windu in a light side run.
[2:54:57] <%baronblank> what did woolie say about the ending again
[2:54:58] <%dekkitout> Tl;dr- Kreia foreshadows the fate of the Prequels/OT
[2:55:03] <TwoStarPlayersNik> it's such an ass ending to what is otherwise a good game
[2:55:04] <Brandon__Brando> @Futurecity10 that sucks I like playing evil sides
[2:55:05] <+Kingtut9009> I never finished KOTOR2 but this game is really fucked huh
[2:55:05] <%delilah4you> Did you do a big win for you fiance?
[2:55:09] <Ipsenscastle> they shouldve just made a straight up linear game yes
[2:55:09] <+bulletzok> light side not much better
[2:55:09] <%asgard147> yeah
[2:55:11] <%SvenHolgersson> They really should have huh
[2:55:12] <%tuesti> yeah dark side is always a joke in KOTOR
[2:55:15] <%Fooguwu> FYI Pat her plan was to use the exile to kill the force, and kill everyone connected to it in the process, leaving a universe decimated but with the only survivors being the rare people totally force numb
[2:55:19] <Meekest> But they're fun
[2:55:22] <+topiodonk> thank god you played dark side, now i can play light side on my own
[2:55:22] <MayorRev> only play as a jedi?
[2:55:27] <+SocialMisfitGamer> SOOOO MUCH FUN
[2:55:31] <vamvas37> @saraizarai nailed it
[2:55:33] <OwlLightningMage> That would've been worse
[2:55:39] <tanarath> ls in kotor 1 was meh
[2:55:40] <Ids560> like dark side in this game can be funny but its clearly not done
[2:55:46] <$Futurecity10> Maybe play light side
[2:55:46] <%QueequegTheater> IMAGINE IF SHE ACTUALLY SAID THT
[2:55:47] <+ReallyBigRocks> how do you KILL THE FORCE??
[2:55:49] <%baronblank> sounded like she wanted to kill the force itself
[2:55:51] <$Futurecity10> off screen
[2:55:52] <%Mr_Pylon> But then her pllan was to just die???
[2:55:52] <tanarath> IT IS
[2:55:53] <%coward_man> 14 months NotLikeThis
[2:55:53] <%QueequegTheater> WOULDN'T THAT BE COOL
[2:55:53] <%dekkitout> I feel that Fallen Order dances around dark side slippery slope better at the end
[2:55:55] <OwlLightningMage> She didn't that
[2:55:57] <GarbageQueenEllie> Damn it Obsidian management!!!
[2:55:58] <Blank9> How would she actually DO that?
[2:56:02] <%tuesti> she does say that in the light side tbh
[2:56:06] <@commanderclaw> 14 months of dev time!
[2:56:09] <EuropanLamprey> Kreia wanted to Star Butterfly the force
[2:56:12] <%BallerSwagBro9k> original dark side ending probably had  exile kikk the force
[2:56:13] <%QueequegTheater> God Obsidian's management sucks
[2:56:14] <Ipsenscastle> play MORE HITMANNN
[2:56:14] <+Kingtut9009> She talked about that plan throughout the game, but yeah, she didnt really say much at the end there at all
[2:56:14] <Blank9> She has no super power for it, and no super weapon
[2:56:20] <alphonseisbest> yup all this ONLY on the light side cooool
[2:56:20] <%Mrbaconator> stream satisfactory?
[2:56:21] <%Undenizen> yeah people don't explain things if you're a huge dick to them

[2:56:23] <%Spydurman> Satisfactory?
[2:56:23] <+topiodonk> i played ds on kotor 1 and left at that, but with kotor 2? I NEED to see the ls route
[2:56:28] <%coward_man> satisfactory?
[2:56:29] <Spudnacious_Dynasty> show us your factory
[2:56:29] <+robert_edwards> Will you ever return to Shipbreaker, or was the embarrassment too much? @patstaresat
[2:56:32] <%Fooguwu> She'd do it by something something force bonds mass suicide

[3:00:50] <narusao> irony?
[3:00:52] <+luftraumm1> I have a theory,  she was a fan and got flustered

[3:01:28] <+TheCrispyBoi> montreal seems like a shithole ngl
[3:01:28] <%Broken_Sonex> She just wanted it more, i guess.

[3:02:01] <Shining_Armor> "Hoho wee wee thievery!"
[3:02:05] <+Midashu> She was so embarrassed for taking the book without saying anything her only course of action was to buy the book and escape
