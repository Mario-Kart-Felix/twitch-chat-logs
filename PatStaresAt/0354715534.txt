[0:00:44] <$NocturneNovember> I think it was in regards to DQ11
[0:00:47] <$nademonkey1100> holy shit im actually going to catch the beining of the strim
[0:00:54] <azacca_bitter> Old man yells at Octopath traveler

[0:26:33] <the_solarflare> Tomoko is my spirit animal
[0:26:33] <%Dr_DangerPhD> Watamote turns depressing really fast and slams on the gas downwards
[0:26:33] <%patricksly36> its like "oh this is how other people see me"
[0:26:33] <+PenmanLupine> it's a harem manga now

[0:26:48] <+dickbuttwoman> That episode where her dad finds her with a boys love anime game and a vibrator is TOO REAL
[0:26:48] <%CerberusDriver> if you have empty bones, you're dead
[0:26:48] <Louie_Salmon> There are some specific bits that were too specific for me to sit through
[0:26:50] <+Kawaso> it produces red blood cells

[0:42:06] <Amperture> The entirety of every joke related to Sheldon in Big Bang Theory -- set up AND punch line -- is "Sheldon is Autistic." And that joke gets old.
[0:42:07] <nikwritesstuff> Any show that has a laughing track seems to imply its viewers have autism and need to be told when to laugh
[0:42:09] <%yeknomlive> abed from community had autism too
[0:42:14] <+JEiddew> Not in her bio, it's her comic
[0:42:15] <+PenmanLupine> that's why Symmetra is so punchable
[0:42:18] <VRNK> that was in symmetra's origin comic
[0:42:18] <%FrustratedAF> remember when overwatch was cool and exciting?

[0:50:21] <$dredgenwulfgaming> cheer500 Hey Pat great to see you stream, just curious, what are your thoughts on the Iceborne expansion for Monster Hunter World being a paid DLC? I personally think it's more than fine seeing as we've had/getting over a year and a half worth of content for free and considering that the expansion itself is going to be bigger than the base game.

[1:26:42] <+tussletoes> The Ampreg

[1:27:57] <Yayo_Smurfy> hello
[1:27:58] <Cobaltor_252> nice, Mesa, the anti-fun frame
[1:28:01] <%GarbageNirvana> All I need for Mesa Prime is the systems
[1:28:01] <$antibonehurtingjuice> PAT DONT SHOOT MEAGGOTS

[1:28:03] <%SuperCasualBoom> You can shoot up Paige...if you know what I mean...🥴
[1:28:04] <corruptLuck> @AngriestPat Try out hunter munitions on your amprex! Does so much damage
[1:28:06] <%MagickBurritoh> Mesa prime has butt cleavage
[1:28:09] <crazyscottnb> vauban + amprax = ez WIN
[1:28:09] <%GarbageNirvana> Gonna see even more of em soon
[1:28:10] <yourliteraldog> The INSEMINATOR 69XJ
[1:28:11] <dekkitout> something something assless chaps
[1:28:18] <%badmr7> Oh hell no, she's the funnest
[1:28:19] <+AntithesisEK> sinister out
[1:28:19] <+ProfessorHotBot> love you pat hope you had a good chrismas
[1:28:21] <+killer_squid1990> Vile Acceleration
[1:28:21] <%eggnogdude> Mesa was always my favorite, Mesa prime is sooo fun :)
[1:28:21] <+SuichiTanaka> Mesa is only anti fun for OTHER frames
[1:28:22] <+jisang0415> spin to win baybe
[1:28:22] <@SSaryn> Just because she kills literally everything.
[1:28:22] <%Arnschen> Nah, Mesa is fun as hell
[1:28:23] <%viewingshades> She's anti-fun for everyone else.
[1:28:24] <Nekros4442> Sinister out
[1:28:25] <%HajimenoStream> IS this game just fun destiny or something?
[1:28:26] <Goraka91> Fun...or time saver
[1:28:26] <+NeoJoker316> I generally use Revenant on Orb Vallis
[1:28:27] <yourbuddycarl> Mesa and Saryn are one button frames
[1:28:27] <Punipunpun> SINSTER REACH
[1:28:27] <$SGrim> @AngriestPat just googled the max rep shit. Little squicky, but not as bad as the internet hyped it up. rooShrug
[1:28:28] <Mittensbro> Volt, Saryn, Mesa, etc. are all anti fun for every other player
[1:28:30] <Ropcord> mesa is fucking great
[1:28:34] <jestrfestr> mesa and Saryn play the game for everyone else
[1:28:34] <Worldbrand> Drop Sinister Reach, it doesn't affect your chain range
[1:28:35] <Junkfist> I wouldn't trade +ms for anything.
[1:28:35] <+jisang0415> i use mesa as a time saver tbh
[1:28:35] <%Laecerelius> I never found hunter munitions to be all that great on the amprex.
[1:28:36] <HerrDemsus> Munition would be heavy dmg
[1:28:37] <+AntithesisEK> but you need to
[1:28:37] <$codussalpha> So, is this game basically Planetside 2 but with robot people?
[1:28:38] <GarbageQueenEllie> Auntie Fun
[1:28:39] <+kira2993> just closer tho
[1:28:39] <Archmortal> Mesa is the most fun when playing her. But playing WITH her kinda makes you feel like you aren't playing sometimes
[1:28:39] <%didyouthinkofthis> take out vile accelaration
[1:28:40] <%KhonsuII> most of the anti-fun frames got patched, I am so glad old ash is gone
[1:28:41] <SeventyForce> And Limbo is anti everything frame.
[1:28:42] <+Ciphris> yeah replace armamints or sinister reach for hutners @AngriestPat
[1:28:44] <+axebird> Vigilante Armaments isn't great
[1:28:44] <nikwritesstuff> No, sinister reach is a must
[1:28:45] <%SuperCasualBoom> You know what works with MPREG? The PNIS!!
[1:28:47] <+jisang0415> MORE DAMAGE THO
[1:28:48] <%HajimenoStream> I love planetside
[1:28:49] <+megabman> ... it is bad
[1:28:49] <+tussletoes> Mesa's fun if you're actually playing her! Unlike Saryn, which is fun for nobody.
[1:28:50] <%MagickBurritoh> at leastMesa prime needs line of sight
[1:28:51] <%eggnogdude> @codussalpha Way better than planetside
[1:28:52] <Dvvolf> Mesa is a room cleaner
[1:28:58] <+AntithesisEK> wait what you have acceleration on amprex, ????
[1:28:58] <DoubledOgre> get rid of reach, stupid
[1:28:59] <%Doc1790> apatSkelmoney
[1:28:59] <Ropcord> mesa is great and i refuse to not kill everything i see
[1:28:59] <mr_ESB> Elmo's just chillin?
[1:29:00] <+JEiddew> vile acceleration what
[1:29:01] <heatrashes> is warframe a massive time sink or is it good to play semi-casually?? would i even make a dent in progression?
[1:29:06] <fruit_pie_the_magician> YOU WILL LIKE THE SLASH PRCS BETTER
[1:29:11] <+nihaomeeow> @yourbuddycarl weird because I use all 4 skills on her unlike the 0 on Inaros
[1:29:14] <+tussletoes> @heatrashes Yes, yes, mmmmmnnnnahhh???
[1:29:14] <IronEncore> I have no idea what's happening :)
[1:29:16] <HerrDemsus> fuck accleration
[1:29:18] <%Raspada_Ryner> @AngriestPat did they fix Mesa's butt yet?
[1:29:20] <Punipunpun> sinster reach dont work like it used to
[1:29:29] <+JEiddew> @AngriestPat is it alright to send you builds over twitter?
[1:29:30] <vingadivo> wtf is this game even
[1:29:31] <+rainboarder> when you wanna play warframe now but its 2am, e h
[1:29:31] <$codussalpha> @eggnogdude but is it essentially the same, gameplay wise? does it require a PS+ sub? i know Planetside doesn't....
[1:29:33] <Worldbrand> Sinister Reach got big nerf; only affects the primary beam
[1:29:35] <tearsaurther> Does the camera always has to be that close to the character?
[1:29:35] <kamen_advent> Pat uses zero skills on Paige
[1:29:38] <Mittensbro> as a newly inducted member into the cult of mesa, i will defend my cowgirl waifu to the death
[1:29:38] <BearSawed> Amphris with fire rate? jesus you will never have ammo
[1:29:43] <$ooblagis> @IronEncore Other players have huge AoE death fields that kill everything as soon as they spawn
[1:29:45] <%SulfurousAcid> oh no Pat's gonna get the space aids
[1:29:46] <mayorrev> some friends helped me get the stalker's bow recently, what are your thoughts on it
[1:29:46] <+Cheese_Whizard> Mesa's one of my favorite frames
[1:29:48] <nikwritesstuff> wait it got nerfed
[1:29:49] <spawnzie> Jerked
[1:29:50] <+tussletoes> That's at least 2 more abilities being used than Chroma.
[1:29:50] <%lethallylactic> Paige jerked Pat Kappa
[1:29:50] <DoubledOgre> inaros's skills don't do shit besides healing you, sandstorm is cool but way too expensive
[1:29:51] <+Griffin1171> PIAGE DED
[1:29:51] <nikwritesstuff> bummer
[1:29:52] <ShovelLich> could be worse I remember pre-nerf ember
[1:29:53] <$ElenaManetta> PAIGE IS JERKING PAT
[1:29:54] <Zulrez> if you're gonna use hunter's munitions on your amprex you had better have viral on it pat wcatKonzu
[1:29:55] <+WhiteMexHD> PrimeRlyTho
[1:29:55] <%walternatorz> earthquake
[1:29:55] <3InchMensch> if they haven't fixed her butt, they're going to. steve commented on it and said that the version they showed on the devstream is the proper version
[1:29:56] <+cerberuscarmine> JERKING
[1:29:56] <thelonechris> Massive damage
[1:29:57] <$SleepyMaribo> @AngriestPat whats inaros skin is that?
[1:29:58] <+Funnyman334> @heatrashes its the kind of thing where you can get to like 90% power in the same length of time it would take to get the other 10%, it doesn't take too long to get good gear
[1:29:58] <VoltageXXII> @heatrashes Massive timesink honestly. To build weapons and frames it can take literal days even after you've gotten all their parts.
[1:29:59] <Goraka91> Since when was reach nerfed
[1:29:59] <%ShiftyFish> I'm kinda afraid to start playing this, as I feel like I'd give up a ton of time to play it.
[1:30:00] <GarbageQueenEllie> RIP in peace Paige
[1:30:02] <+technyc25> ju cuhrazy? saryn is the shizz
[1:30:02] <ebonifragaria> OH LAWD SHE COMIN

[1:30:49] <Worldbrand> And low size in general
[1:30:50] <+Electric_J> Not with Paige around
[1:30:52] <kamen_advent> It's because she's preggors, that makes the ass extra thicc
[1:30:58] <Carnival_Ink> KAPOW
[1:31:01] <$ElenaManetta> YOUR PEEPEE?
[1:31:03] <itesket> It's the pregnant rumbles?
[1:31:03] <%eggnogdude> @codussalpha Planetside is closer to older batllefield games like 3 an d 4 than to warframe
[1:31:04] <%SulfurousAcid> his pee hole
[1:31:04] <mercado94> "let my people go"
[1:31:08] <BeeNoons> balls out on stream

[1:31:16] <Fujiwara_92> his peephole
[1:31:16] <%happyface699> Peep
[1:31:17] <BourneWarrior> Pee Hole?
[1:31:17] <+namillus> @yourliteraldog Warframe pets are test-tube doggos and cattos.
[1:31:17] <+cerberuscarmine> she break everything
[1:31:22] <%snow_bush> Now to grind to Mobages while I watch another man play Vidya. This is how I always pictured adulthood.
[1:31:23] <+namillus> Or robots
[1:31:25] <AnDyLV> Pat loves mpreg, when is Paige gonna do her magic on him?
[1:31:26] <kamen_advent> As bad as her McDonalds trash nest?
[1:31:26] <%TheMilhouseExperience> “Pure”
[1:31:27] <$codussalpha> @eggnogdude i mean is it a big, open mapped free to play kind of game
[1:31:28] <+Electric_J> Paige's meat swells and the earth moves with it
[1:31:30] <%hawk_rush> Welcome to the Pat Stares At Peep Hole stream apatSmug
[1:31:32] <%LupaTheWolf> @AngriestPat if you ever want to do Conservation stuff in fortuna, I did an in depth guide on the discord on how to catch all the things
[1:31:36] <%Laecerelius> shred is great on the amprex
[1:31:37] <+TheDude8D> pat what is the best thing to do for cetus standing
[1:31:37] <+nihaomeeow> @yourbuddycarl old was worse though, spam spores on molt and turret, now you can melee the shit out enemies with toxic lash and spread spores by running around and miasma is bad without spreading spores although I think the should nerf the non spore miasma damage even more
[1:31:43] <Kiraklene> Peephole stream
[1:31:43] <%mistymntns> Wait. When did this stream start?
[1:31:49] <%HajimenoStream> Yoo Pat I love Endo too
[1:31:50] <filialpails> endometriosis?
[1:31:52] <Junkfist> You need endo a lot
[1:31:53] <%SuperCasualBoom> Vote Pat. He is for the Peep-hole!
[1:31:54] <%bbHighvalor> !uptime
[1:31:54] <@Moobot> I've been playing this game for how long? Oh only 1h 31m 55s.
[1:31:55] <+Griffin1171> he almost said delicious
[1:31:55] <%HajimenoStream> we gotta have a sesh
[1:31:56] <nikwritesstuff> ENDO rewards, the bane of lategame
[1:32:04] <itesket> BIG PREGNANT
[1:32:09] <%eggnogdude> @codussalpha Yes, that it is, but the gameplay is as different as you can get
[1:32:09] <%Aleate> apatDab Wassup my dudes apatDab
[1:32:10] <DracaenaLeaf> Is Skelmo being replaced??
[1:32:10] <%GarbageNirvana> Does Pat use a controller for this game? Never thought to ask
[1:32:10] <frossanot> gotta level up those primed mods
[1:32:10] <SeventyForce> I like atomos more tbh, I made it look like a brain and shoots bubble gum pink jeez
[1:32:12] <+Funnyman334> saryns 4 also makes it so enemies that die by spore ticks while in it will spread spores
[1:32:12] <Goraka91> Endo and credits everywhere DansGame
[1:32:12] <Reanimator83> Paige has been MPREGD
[1:32:12] <crazyscottnb> faster fire rate = more dmg per sec compare to rage that really doesn't do much for u
[1:32:14] <vingadivo> GRRGANANT
[1:32:17] <ScreamingMeat> Skelmo about to be replaced
[1:32:21] <Fujiwara_92> @angriestpat I'm thinking into starting warframe, should I play pc or ps4?
[1:32:24] <Punipunpun> yeah sinister reach only effect my main lighting and not the little ones branching off
[1:32:24] <Goraka91> What
[1:32:28] <ProRJHunter> What
[1:32:28] <+sana_kan> yeah that shit's whack
[1:32:28] <+Typhaeon> Fuck Toei
[1:32:28] <Darren716> Wat
[1:32:28] <mercado94> WE WANT MONEY

[1:32:53] <EVA_Unit02> Toei tweeted that they have no knowledge about it
[1:32:55] <theshyboyman> I've never seen so many stinklines in a game before
[1:32:55] <%jetrouverai> That's so fucked
[1:32:57] <Fujiwara_92> it's shueisha
[1:32:57] <aiyobro> cross tag battle is fun
[1:32:58] <SunsetJack> Toei said it wasn't them lol
[1:32:59] <+Funnyman334> wow that was a poorly put together sentence by me

[1:33:09] <+sana_kan> I mean.....it's pretty good but yknow....tekken 7 is also pretty good...........
[1:33:10] <%eggnogdude> @codussalpha Kinda a little bit maybe?
[1:33:10] <$ElenaManetta> IT'S WHY THE TUMBLR FIASCO WAS GREAT
[1:33:11] <mayorrev> JUST PLAY SMASH BROS YOU IDIOTS
[1:33:12] <antthefool> So does this mean the scene is dead? For DBZF
[1:33:12] <Nekros4442> Shueisha is another publishing company
[1:33:12] <+AntithesisEK> a publishing company
[1:33:13] <nikwritesstuff> that got to be the dumbest thing i've heard in a while
[1:33:14] <%TheMilhouseExperience> Esports is so good for the fgc right?!
[1:33:15] <%Molarin> What the fuck is that gun, jesus christ
[1:33:15] <+nihaomeeow> shueisha owns the dbz license
[1:33:17] <%commanderclaw> Shuiesha owns shonen jump
[1:33:17] <+PenmanLupine> @AngriestPat Shueisha is the publishing company for Shonen Jump
[1:33:17] <+gwanzan> Shuesha publishes Shonen Jump
[1:33:18] <Jrockoni> Warframe, the game that if your good enough you never even see who your shooting for more the half a second
[1:33:19] <+jisang0415> THE MANGA PUBLISHING COMPANY
[1:33:19] <+Kqha4000> @AngriestPat Shuiesha is the publisher for the manga
[1:33:21] <CampinSteve> this game is already better than anthem
[1:33:22] <rockworm> that means you can play a better fighting game like MvC Infinite *trollface*
[1:33:23] <+tussletoes> @mercado94 Hell yeah host your events down here
[1:33:24] <%Paralurx> @AngriestPat Shueisha publishes Shonen Jump and owns half the rights to Dragon Ball
[1:33:24] <+JEiddew> @AngriestPat I sent you an amprex build over twitter, assuming I did things correctly.
[1:33:24] <+mobius_won> Time for guilty gear
[1:33:26] <%eggnogdude> PLAY TEKKEN PAT1
[1:33:27] <GarbageQueenEllie> Business Seppuku
[1:33:27] <+Griffin1171> I've heard of them in the opening for DBZA
[1:33:27] <AggsMK7> RIP Spooky
[1:33:28] <austonamous> yeah I saw toei tweeting that they had no knowledge on the matter
[1:33:30] <%The_Butterfly_Man> well Tekken 7 is still great but not the same?
[1:33:35] <%oKentucky> @AngriestPat what did i miss ahhh
[1:33:36] <kiraellion> so basically blame shonen jump
[1:33:37] <+23boydanny> A manga publishing company, original publisher for Jump manga like Dragonball
[1:33:38] <+Shaggnar> Now we'll have to go back to Guilty Gear, like that's a bad thing
[1:33:40] <%Aleate> apatPorgmo apatPorgmo apatPorgmo
[1:33:40] <%Shooterboy23> Spooky put copyrights in SUB MODE apatDab apatDab apatDab apatDab
[1:33:43] <%GarbageNirvana> Old media vs new media I guess
[1:33:47] <+Funnyman334> Oh did you see we may not be getting jojo Friday this week?
[1:33:48] <$codussalpha> so why does a magazine company control the rights to a video game?
[1:33:49] <HerrDemsus> too long??
[1:33:50] <+kira2993> it on critical tho
[1:33:51] <CaptainBackdown> Makes sense, they've hated money for decades
[1:33:51] <%DTarded> Hey pat, i hope you are keeping well :3
[1:33:52] <%CharileMurphyPendelton> more like Shuuuutthefuckupsha? amiright
[1:33:52] <%sunriser696> they get past armor and kill everything
[1:33:53] <+technyc25> god I hate destiny and battlefront
[1:33:54] <haisho> reminder that slash procs stack
[1:33:54] <%snow_bush> TO LIIIVE
[1:33:55] <+DarkOnyx7> DOes this mean Jump Force is dead on arrival?
[1:33:55] <Nekros4442> It wont take too long. Trust me, Amprex goes crazy
[1:33:57] <+tussletoes> Slash procs are boring. It's all about that BIG raw damage
[1:33:57] <kiraellion> because japan is weird
[1:33:57] <+Ciphris> it'll speed it up @AngriestPat
[1:33:58] <rockworm> see I'm over here going "HOLY SHIT YOU CAN FLY IN WARFRAME"
[1:33:58] <+AntithesisEK> irrelevant concern
[1:33:59] <+jisang0415> slash is never a bad thig
[1:34:01] <$Yakobro> @codussalpha because they own dbz
[1:34:01] <Dvvolf> what's your opinion on k-drives ?
[1:34:02] <+Ssoline> !uptime
[1:34:02] <@Moobot> I've been playing this game for how long? Oh only 1h 34m 4s.
[1:34:03] <$ElenaManetta> (shows up at 2am) FUCK I MISSED THE STREAM
[1:34:04] <+thecarpetduck> i just started playing this game and this looks nothing like what ive bee. doing lol
[1:34:04] <gekizenbu> @codussalpha because they own half the rights to Goku
[1:34:06] <mercado94> EVERYTHING
[1:34:06] <+nihaomeeow> @codussalpha they own dragonball
[1:34:06] <nikwritesstuff> I keep getting the feeling that Japanese companies really don't understand or care how streaming works
[1:34:07] <%SuperCasualBoom> Kentucky said Fried Chicken
[1:34:08] <+razielhex> Do melee only runs. Unequip all ranged slots.
[1:34:09] <%hawk_rush> @oKentucky welcome back my boiii
[1:34:12] <+namillus> @rockworm It's called the Archwing and it's GREAT
[1:34:13] <BearSawed> Bunch of dicks is what they are, and its japan and copyright law of course its fucked
[1:34:13] <CampinSteve> I got to play the anthem alpha. It is NOT good.
[1:34:13] <tri3dgE027> Hi there Pat, I am Warframe Newbie and would like to ask, aside from Moor's Bazaar is there other ways to trade in this game? I originally was part of a clan but got booted out due to inactivity (due to me being busy at work). Not really open to join a new Clan as I feel I cannot commit as much time to it due to work + commute time
[1:34:14] <%oKentucky> I was eating
[1:34:14] <mr_ESB> Babby Elmo BibleThump
[1:34:16] <AMajorTom> @oKentucky Lots of thanks from Pat for your gift subs
[1:34:17] <lewdskeletor13> You missed the breeding
[1:34:17] <Archmortal> Imagine thinking streams and tournaments for one of the best fighting games in the last decade was somehow hurting your profits
[1:34:19] <%oKentucky> @AngriestPat I was eating
[1:34:20] <verelme> Argon scope is incredible on amprex cuz free easy headshots always
[1:34:20] <+cerberuscarmine> PEE
[1:34:21] <$codussalpha> i thought toei animation owned DBZ?
[1:34:22] <%camodikk> did i miss a announement on the discord?
[1:34:23] <%Aleate> I really wish I could farm normal bounties and not Orb Part 2 FeelsBadMan
[1:34:25] <%jetrouverai> @okentucky thx for the sub friend
[1:34:26] <+ChaosVulpes> How can this be!?!
[1:34:29] <%GarbageNirvana> @rockworm You can use it in certain missions and in open world areas if you get the launcher
[1:34:32] <EVA_Unit02> Jump is a just a magazine. It's like saying just blame Gamespot, but you should blame Gamestop @kiraellion
[1:34:34] <Goraka91> Japanese companies are all old men who don't understand the internet
[1:34:36] <+tussletoes> I will eat the rich and throw every Argon Scope in the trash.
[1:34:37] <fairore> melt
[1:34:40] <+JEiddew> @tri3dgE027 google warframe market
[1:34:40] <Shatterthought> @tri3dgE027 just have other people invite you to their clan dojos to trade
[1:34:41] <%oKentucky> @jetrouverai no problem
[1:34:41] <antthefool> Fucking kill them all pat
[1:34:41] <%snow_bush> @codussalpha I think they have Super

[1:34:49] <$ElenaManetta> PAT AINT GOING BACK TO RETAIL
[1:34:51] <Booette94> or not LUL
[1:34:52] <+namillus> People say that the Archwing controls like butt, but fuck those people I had a dogfight with an Ogma on the Plains of Eidolon and WON
[1:34:52] <+nihaomeeow> atlus apparently just registered ‘Persona 5 B,’ ‘Persona 5 M,’ and ‘Persona 5 S’ domains
[1:34:54] <%oKentucky> its my favorite stream - i want other people to enjoy
[1:34:56] <AnAsianToaster> or maybe you'll just die a miserable death

[2:08:55] <%Dualparadoxes> cheer500 Pat, I just finished watching your old sonic mania streams, it was real neat watching you just CRUSH blue sphere. Also, on the topic of letting crazy people just ramble, I once got an uber ride from this one lady who was really bought in to the Mandela Effect. Like, she with all seriousness believed that we all, collectively, had our memories changed at some point and just spent the whole 15 minute ride talking about it. It was the best

[2:39:09] <+TheDude8D> I love horror games but got to the end of this one and couldn't do it
[2:39:09] <%kite1haseo> jermaJup1 jermaJup2
[2:39:09] <VoltageXXII> @yourliteraldog Water. A lot of Water.
[2:39:11] <+cuttlecrow> ah there it is
[2:39:12] <+DangerMan83> says Subnautica now
[2:39:13] <%D2_Synua> Really not a fan of this elevator music
[2:39:13] <+Sonbunns> can we post links in the chat?
[2:39:13] <%happyface699> Get the map child
[2:39:15] <yourliteraldog> Oceans are scary
[2:39:19] <OwlLightningMage> I hope Pat gets eaten by a shark
[2:39:20] <VioletRosefall> what music is this?
[2:39:20] <Goraka91> Subnautica is a plot based survival game about exploration and getting the fuck off this hell planet
[2:39:25] <Gorgen> this really isnt a horror game
[2:39:27] <%SuperCasualBoom> The 5 minute break was really a sneaky incest quickie.
[2:39:28] <+Dasbubba> @yourliteraldog You crash on a planet covered entirely in water. Try to survive by building a rocket to fly out of there to rescue. In the interim you discover more about the planet and others that were there before you.
[2:39:29] <keksisblyat> I dig this song. It’s so peaceful

[2:39:30] <%hawk_rush> If I made people's days/nights, then I'm happy tonight :)
[2:39:31] <%legendfather_of_giants> @OwlLightningMage the real draw of the game is the fundamental fear of whats down there
[2:39:31] <+TheDude8D> what gorako said
[2:39:32] <%happyface699> get Kevin Costner and the child
[2:39:37] <XdaXcaptainX> this is the start of the true atlantica arc, boys
[2:39:39] <+Purrserker_Barrage> it's fun survival but can be like...genuinely stressful at times. especially if you dont watch your oxygen
[2:39:40] <energywarning> this is a long piss
[2:39:42] <%TheDullaMAN> Changed
[2:39:43] <%sparrrow_> Subnautica is a game about surviving in Grenada
[2:39:44] <321Continue> STOP TALKING ABOUT INCEST
[2:39:46] <+Dasbubba> It can get really spooky if you have a fear of the open ocean and big stuff possibly living in it.
[2:39:47] <hellothisisxig> ohh! things are happening! game changed!
[2:39:48] <danknugglit> This game is about a penguin with ptst learing about crimbas
[2:39:48] <CaptainBackdown> Everybody remember: He needs to fix the ship's reactor before it explodes
[2:39:50] <CookieCutter007> The game is pretty spooky
[2:39:51] <+TheDude8D> the meat swells
[2:39:52] <+ItsRatman> NEVER STOP THE INCEST
[2:39:53] <+DangerMan83> Can't stop won't stop

[3:05:42] <sparkboy777> @AngriestPat if youre TOO anxious, just play it on freedom mode. it just removes the foodand water aspect. just like fallout.
[3:05:43] <+FattimusSlime> @angriestpat time to break the XENOGEARS glass?
[3:05:43] <%discodemolition> @AngriestPat just turn off the survival stuff lol

[3:05:44] <%gnarly_memes_bro> i hate survival games but i respect the dedication it takes to play them
[3:05:44] <%driemen> play facrotio on peaceful!
[3:05:45] <Gesshoku01> is this for real?
[3:05:45] <randomp141> TELL PAT ABOUT THE MECH! THAT WILL KEEP HIM GOING!
[3:05:45] <%SuperCasualBoom> Streams over!!
[3:05:45] <%collapsedVigil> THAT'S WHATS FUN ABOUT IT
[3:05:45] <yourliteraldog> Play red dead
[3:05:45] <%ssjklyco> cheer200 imagine the sonic drowning noise as you swim for max discomfort.
[3:05:47] <ProRJHunter> I already miss Yakuza
[3:05:47] <Pyrotechie> SPOOKED
[3:05:47] <ebonifragaria> Power through it and you will become POSIEDON, KING OF THE DEEP
[3:05:47] <Mastermind_Omega> It will get easier to handle
[3:05:47] <%QueequegTheater> @AngriestPat DON'T WORRY THERE'S NO HARD GAME OVER
[3:05:47] <hellothisisxig> There's so much upkeep and so much to keep track of.
[3:05:48] <%Idziman> !uptime
[3:05:48] <+Shaggnar> You're not even at that anxious part yet
[3:05:48] <@Moobot> I've been playing this game for how long? Oh only 3h 5m 50s.
[3:05:48] <mr_slaide> But you're a coward.
[3:05:49] <Sir_Rovert_> @AngriestPat I'd shit my pants if I played in VR
[3:05:50] <%Cavumentum> WORLD OF LIGHT TIME
[3:05:50] <Worldbrand> that's me about darkest dungeon
[3:05:50] <+Forente> fear of drowning
[3:05:50] <+Nomicro4u> SHITSTORM GAME

[3:05:51] <Nordguy> HEYY let's go play videogame
[3:05:52] <+Ramsus88> you get used to it eventually
[3:05:52] <jiffyrustle> FEAR QUIT
[3:05:52] <+cuttlecrow> O C D
[3:05:53] <sparkboy777> JUST PLAY ON FREEDOM
[3:05:53] <+Ramsus88> kinda
[3:05:54] <%korth367> man ur a wimp lol
[3:05:55] <$ElenaManetta> DOES THE TOMB RAIDER SUFFOCATING ANIMATION UPSET YOU
[3:05:56] <+minotaurhead> I love it when people play subnautica for the first time and realise they're afraid of the open ocean
[3:05:56] <%Fruitywhompus> anxiety the video game !
[3:05:57] <%furiousfurioso> @AngriestPat you can turn off the food and water if you want
[3:05:57] <%TheDullaMAN> Make an airtank, bro
[3:05:58] <mr_slaide> COWARD!!!!!!
[3:05:59] <+Tarkara> @AngriestPat if it helps its not like its permadeath or anything
[3:05:59] <abatage> @AngriestPat the management stuff gets so much easier over time - you barely have to think about resources once you get underway
[3:05:59] <danknugglit> PLAY RED DEAD COWARD
[3:06:00] <%BinaryForest> You get stuff that makes basic survival way easier pretty quickly
[3:06:00] <%RaikenTB> How many hundreds of hours is a full run usually?
[3:06:01] <+TheDude8D> But you can save whenever you want
[3:06:01] <%marvinbrewton25> It is just the ocean mans greatest fear! and spiders...
[3:06:02] <IntrepidEye> you haven't even left the babby area yet
[3:06:02] <Shastafield> subnautica is supposed to do that
[3:06:03] <+JEiddew> you don't have to play the game patty
[3:06:03] <yourliteraldog> I couldn't finsih alien isolation
[3:06:04] <rosabellamelantha> @AngriestPat there is no auto save so save a TON
[3:06:05] <+CheshirePierrot> @AngriestPat You swim faster without anything equipped, for when you need air
[3:06:05] <TrispyCrispy> the sense of awe that comes with the environments outweighs those feelings, in my opinion
[3:06:05] <+TheUberknife> back down?
[3:06:06] <%sparrrow_> you don't really need it though
[3:06:06] <%CapnCarnivore> @AngriestPat make a knife to fend off small(er) predators. one slice and they'll fuck off
[3:06:06] <%rdark_ksu> Management games are the woooooorst
[3:06:06] <Sprettba11> i cant wait for pat to shit his pants in like 30 min
[3:06:07] <CaptainBackdown> The anxiousness is the best part
[3:06:08] <%TheFilth> but you can replace batteries tho
[3:06:08] <+lucid_lynxi> nah dont worry about the power
[3:06:08] <aegis910> KEEP PLAYING PLZ
[3:06:09] <%JJCheeker> Play something else dude <3
[3:06:09] <Gesshoku01> nah fam bye lol
[3:06:09] <+cuttlecrow> Pat....don't worry about, you'll be fine
[3:06:09] <Booette94> @AngriestPat I hate these kinds of games, but seriously stick with it, this one is very special
[3:06:10] <HanPaul> Red Dead DansGame
[3:06:11] <Innocuous_Goat> Be big strong, ladies are watching
[3:06:11] <mr_slaide> Big coward.
[3:06:13] <+eshafferart> You can make your own batteries and a battery recharger. It'll all be okay pat
[3:06:13] <Dio_TR> PLAY FUCKING WARFRAME YOU FUCK
[3:06:14] <$SirG005E> eventually you just carry a bunch of extra batteries
[3:06:14] <+zensane> Pussification of the modern male
[3:06:15] <%Prism_Wing> Better switch to PT Kappa
[3:06:16] <%sunriser696> honestly, games like this are a good way to get over anxiety of things
[3:06:16] <foreverN2dust> But the feeling you get when you overcome it and have a smooth system going is godly.
[3:06:17] <AggsMK7> Yeah but making a battery took 2 mins
[3:06:17] <+TheUberknife> this sounds like a back down
[3:06:18] <+Weapon901> The game gets easier as you get better with resources
[3:06:18] <%commanderclaw> @AngriestPat If limited resources make you anxious, why do you like Resident Evil?
[3:06:18] <ebonifragaria> You can play without that (if you're a giant pussy)
[3:06:18] <+baronothebest> Pat it is much better on Freedom mode, it's the same but without food and water management
[3:06:19] <+TheDude8D> Lot's of ease of life comes later don't worry it gets easier/worse
[3:06:20] <%fattness132> @AngriestPat part of subnautica's whole point is to make you feel anxious
[3:06:21] <%sparrrow_> @AngriestPat you could turn off the hunger and thirst if you want
[3:06:21] <poweredscoot> DON'T LET YOUR FINGERLESS GLOVE METER GET TOO LOW
[3:06:22] <Darthkitten_Prime> You'll be fine in terms of resources, it gets easier as it goes on.
[3:06:22] <FisherSpice> Anxiety: the game
[3:06:24] <Kemmybelle> Does this version have the option to turn off getting food and oxygen?
[3:06:25] <%Agami23> pat, did you not see how many parts to batteries you got right away?
[3:06:25] <+atlasbot1> look in your inventory now
[3:06:27] <Feornic> @AngriestPat You can do a lower difficulty that (if I'm remembering correctly) removes the need to eat and drink
[3:06:27] <%happyface699> Let’s play o.t
[3:06:29] <kapisbr> hello
[3:06:31] <sparkboy777> @AngriestPat just play on freedom mode instead of survival if you need to.
[3:06:32] <+TheDude8D> YEAH
[3:06:34] <%ouroborowski> apatWink
[3:06:34] <%GarbageNirvana> Aren't RE games all about resource management though?
[3:06:35] <TheEnablerr> @AngriestPat once you really learn it in 30 minutes you have everything you'll ever need
[3:06:39] <OkamiDude15> fear the old fish... seek the palewater transcend the ocean
[3:06:39] <%OwlLightningMage> apatWink apatWink apatBlep apatBlep
[3:06:39] <%CapnCarnivore> @AngriestPat make a knife to fend off small(ish) predators. one slice and they'll fuck off\
[3:06:41] <jeecay> kitty
[3:06:41] <+TheRealSono> @AngriestPat If it makes you feel better, battereies last a long time
[3:06:42] <GingerBingertheSecond> Seaglide PogChamp
[3:06:42] <%lilo52> just play hatframe dude
[3:06:43] <%Neo_Kaiser> No, it was Pat that did that Paige.
[3:06:45] <mayorrev> "BOOOOO!"
[3:06:46] <%RilsRislan> You're just in the starting stages, you grow out of the concerns
[3:06:48] <Nordguy> omg
[3:06:48] <rosabellamelantha> Seaglide best boy
[3:06:51] <keksisblyat> But you just make more batteries and apparently you’re able to recharge them later
[3:06:51] <CaptainBackdown> Seaglide so good
[3:06:51] <ebonifragaria> He whispered in her ear: "5"
[3:06:55] <Captain_Joe1911> Emlo notekHug
[3:06:55] <mayorrev> "booOooOoOO!"
[3:06:56] <%RilsRislan> You just gotta get up
[3:06:56] <+cuttlecrow> Pat survival in real life is the first 24 hours, you're doing fine
[3:06:58] <+Gooniekorn> he so good
[3:06:58] <Laicuss> if this makes you anxious, later game areas will actually give you a heart attack
[3:07:01] <+tussletoes> Despite all his rage???
[3:07:01] <%JJCheeker> Play what you like Pat it's all good
[3:07:02] <TheWesternFront> resource management is very little in this game with only occasional need to fill up on food/water. You got this my guy
[3:07:03] <+Dasbubba> @Kemmybelle There is a mode that is called creative where you cannot die although at that point the progression kind of goes away and you lose the structure of the game's story and it's more to just goof around.
[3:07:04] <Fujiwara_92> let's just go back to waframs
[3:07:04] <energywarning> bloooh
[3:07:04] <Goraka91> Elmo has escaped containment WutFace

[3:36:00] <Ombrebird> drop thine egg

[3:36:03] <Goraka91> You can build lockers on the walls
[3:36:03] <Sir_Rovert_> they just float outside the pod
[3:36:03] <Kraken_In_The_Mist> build a small base
[3:36:03] <rockworm> put the lockers just outside the pod
[3:36:03] <+Bloodxb> they stay put
[3:36:04] <+Shaggnar> Just deal with it until you build the base, Pat
[3:36:04] <%legendfather_of_giants> @AngriestPat put more lockers on ship wall
[3:36:04] <%furiousfurioso> @AngriestPat they just float where you put them, so put them outside the pod
[3:36:06] <TheEnablerr> @AngriestPat they stay in the same location you drop them
[3:36:06] <aeravon> this base is only temp
[3:36:06] <hellothisisxig> or try to consolidate
[3:36:06] <+cuttlecrow> ITS AN ESCAPE POD PAT
[3:36:06] <$SirG005E> its actually more convenient
[3:36:07] <BeeNoons> this isn't gonna be your home
[3:36:08] <Kraken_In_The_Mist> right next to the pod
[3:36:09] <+Walopoh> LOCKERS ARE STATIONARY
[3:36:09] <Innocuous_Goat> Make a habitat builder
[3:36:10] <%stumpy1337> Build one of the wall lockers
[3:36:10] <Loarfy> they stay where you put them :) you can use them until you get a stable base
[3:36:11] <%tank7013> That is the solution to all of your problems
[3:36:11] <Darthkitten_Prime> You'll be able to make a base soon.
[3:36:13] <%RilsRislan> Make a specific goal
[3:36:13] <+Iggle_Ohs> @AngriestPat You will one day abandon this lifepod and never want to come back, because you can build bases. Habitat builder.
[3:36:13] <Ape_Law> use the door on the bottom of the pod instead of the ladder
[3:36:14] <%Keyd00d> I mean
[3:36:15] <%collapsedVigil> THEY DON'T MOVE
[3:36:15] <+cuttlecrow> ITS A FUCKING ESCAPE POD
[3:36:15] <joeyjojo70> Water Lockers don't move
[3:36:15] <%driemen> lockers don't move
[3:36:15] <+baronothebest> Once you get a bit farther you can make your own base
[3:36:16] <Shastafield> you cant expand lockers
[3:36:18] <%AncelDeLambert> @angriestpat literally just drop the locker at your feet in here, it won't go anywhere
[3:36:19] <+Walopoh> LOCKERS DONT MOVE
[3:36:19] <%RilsRislan> Which shuld be Repair it
[3:36:23] <+GoBoomYay> A habitat builder lets you start a base
[3:36:23] <+ChaosVulpes> PokBraixen
[3:36:23] <TheEnablerr> lockers don't move
[3:36:24] <+ArcanumMBD> @AngriestPat You need to deal with shit storage until you build a base and then you can fill it with all the storage lockers you want
[3:36:25] <deadbugs> you have to move away from the pod at one point to build a base
[3:36:26] <%sparrrow_> will it be an LP format or a stream
[3:36:28] <%Hollandiae> The escape pod is not for permanent residence yeah?
[3:36:29] <VritraReiRei> @AngriestPat make a base, then make some lockers. they are REALLY easy to make. mostly titanium which is located everywhere
[3:36:29] <%Kghaleon> it takes a long while before you can build a base with infinite storage
[3:36:30] <%SuperCasualBoom> Is it me or does Pat look like Chang from King of Fighters. Paige is the Ball & Chain.
[3:36:31] <+cuttlecrow> LUL

[3:37:03] <joeyjojo70> Do you plan on playing any old rpgs on twitch? If so, give Golden Sun a shot.
[3:37:03] <wic17> the pod drifts,
[3:37:03] <$NichothedesSayre> They may not drift away but you can lose track of them very easily
[3:37:04] <KekFrog> I think the question was more "Is Pat going to stream ALL of his first playthrough on Twitch"
[3:37:05] <%sparrrow_> lmao
[3:37:06] <+GoBoomYay> A habitat builder is what you need to make the internal storage

[3:37:15] <%legendfather_of_giants> TURN SALVAGE INTO TITANIUM
[3:37:15] <%crimsonharvest> until you have a base you need to use ONE of the solutions

[3:37:30] <%collapsedVigil> CAN FIX, BUILD BASE LATER AND MAKE PRETTY THEN
[3:37:30] <definitelynotyakra> Pat, once you get the base builder tool, you'll probably never come back to the pod again, because you'll have an underwater ghost base of your very own
[3:37:32] <Bouldus> what?

[3:42:41] <$railmee_hardurr> Long range sniper preganancy
[3:42:42] <Inebriateddonut> Just remember how you felt at the beginning of Warframe
[3:42:42] <%crimsonharvest> melt salvage into titanium in basic
[3:42:42] <%BinaryForest> Even if you die you don't lose anything that's in storage
[3:42:43] <%Spydurman> gobolins have infected Pat

[3:42:44] <+Rararachan> NOTHING BAD HAPPENS EVEN IF YOU STARVE OR RUN OUT OF WATER, YOU JUST RESPAWN
[3:42:44] <%TheFilth> the point is to not understand, then to understand one thing at a time

[3:42:48] <reiju_22> I guess this is how people feel with monhun
[3:42:50] <xshadowcastx> the exploding fish pods pat!! the fish pods have the sulfur!!
[3:42:50] <+alexd379> Pat the explosion causes the ship's area of the ocean to be highly irradiated
[3:42:51] <CaptainKarite> "survival"
[3:42:51] <%TheMilhouseExperience> It’s better than Fallout.
[3:42:52] <CookieCutter007> We got the wiki

[3:43:00] <%icekept> as long as you no close to it
[3:43:02] <+ButtStevens> Has anyone told him to break down the salvage
[3:43:03] <aeravon> you lose your inventory if you die but you come back
[3:43:03] <+Urgotfantasy> Thats why I never bothered with survival mode
[3:43:03] <Stewbedale> Start a new save on hardcore
[3:43:03] <wic17> you can make another tank if you want
[3:43:06] <%QueequegTheater> @Keyd00d To get off planet
[3:43:09] <+SilverSnowFFXIV> Pipes and pumps are garbage don't bother.
[3:43:11] <%RilsRislan> But it's not anything to be anxious about
[3:43:12] <Goraka91> Death is meaningless. Still terrifying though
[3:43:13] <+megamonmon123> is this the DARK SOULS of SWIMMING?

[3:56:43] <%DrFacilier> dont you dare compare this to no man buy
[3:56:47] <+dickbuttwoman> ~12 years
[3:56:51] <nikwritesstuff> isn't that sending distress signal to that ship that just exploded?
[3:56:52] <%hawk_rush> @awsomesaucekirby oh whoops, I misread that -- I read that you had to actually work overtime
[3:56:52] <+aslfrasle> 11.5 years
[3:56:54] <%TheMilhouseExperience> Enough
[3:56:57] <+Riseskimo> @AngriestPat favorite frame/for honor hero/FFXIV class?
[3:56:57] <%crimsonharvest> Now that you have the scanner and repair tool you can do everything
[3:56:58] <BaronVonDickButt> High Bacterium levels
[3:57:04] <swift_malachi> No Man's Sky is waaaay better now.... which means it's just ok
[3:57:04] <%SaltyDongs> nine hundred twenty five thousand six hundred minutes
[3:57:05] <%furiousfurioso> @AngriestPat you can totally turn your pod into a skyrim hovel, dropped items will stay permanently!
[3:57:05] <ebonifragaria> I CAN DO ANYTHING

[3:57:15] <scottishwolf> Wonder how you'll get those support aparatus
[3:57:16] <NumbusPlays> like, giant whales?
[3:57:24] <+TheDude8D> that would be 114.15 years
[3:57:26] <LtThunderbolt> ''beastwars Megatron laugh"
[3:57:27] <%QueequegTheater> @furiousfurioso He can't drop items inside it
[3:57:28] <%DrFacilier> water aids
[3:57:32] <Mastermind_Omega> self scan
[3:57:33] <%DrFacilier> its water aids
[3:57:34] <DocMadfox> There's 8760 hours in a year so 9999 hours would be a little over a year.
[3:57:34] <TheAlphaMinion> self scan ??
[3:57:34] <321Continue> Paige is your extensive support apparatus
[3:57:35] <%mortalitas87> probably not important
[3:57:41] <%Hollandiae> self scan pls
[3:57:42] <TalisKanju> Is this the new AngriestPat, where PeachSaliva is off-screen?
[3:57:46] <CaptainKarite> still repetitve
[3:57:47] <+cuttlecrow> he came up normal so he's ok
[3:57:47] <Warbot40> In that case no
[3:57:48] <Sparty9112> Vermintide 2 is pretty repetitive
[3:57:48] <+xxviios> That goes for Earth too lol
[3:57:49] <%QueequegTheater> SELF SCAN
[3:57:52] <%TrispyCrispy> @AngriestPat you should make a Seaglide whenever you're able, it makes traversing the water so much quicker and easier
[3:57:53] <%SuperCasualBoom> No Fucks: Giving
[3:57:53] <Sparty9112> but it plays better
[3:57:55] <%WheatlyXT> he admits his game is bad
[3:57:55] <aeravon> time to go make a base
[3:57:57] <ebonifragaria> Paige is now a voice that lives in Pat's head
[3:57:59] <GuardsmanGary> vermintides combat is way more involving and dynamic than shoot gun
[3:58:00] <Goraka91> If you didn't like L4D you probably wouldn't like Vermintide
[3:58:01] <%SweetCheeksTrap> did he self scan?
[3:58:02] <bananagourmet> i got some fluid intake for ya right here, pal
[3:58:04] <+dickbuttwoman> Get you some water
[3:58:07] <AggsMK7> Stock some waters

[3:58:15] <%fattness132> @AngriestPat eating any cooked food gives you some water, so if you need it bad just cook a bunch of any fish

[3:58:43] <mr_slaide> Look at that asshole moon.
[3:58:44] <%dizilicious> pjsalt200 Here's a big 'nother advice. You're totally overestimating the difficulty of the game. You're playing like you're on insane difficulty when you're only on normal. In fact, the game is SO forgiving that sometimes it's more efficient to DIE instead of fulfilling basic eating and drinking requirements. The ONLY downside is that you lose all your inventory gained prior to the last time you left a base/lifepod.
[3:58:45] <+trnzero> hmm

[4:00:36] <+Walopoh> You just fixed the radio AKA the direction machine
[4:00:36] <+dickbuttwoman> For bettering yourself, you mean
[4:00:37] <%OwlLightningMage> It has a story
[4:00:37] <video0_0> always the uncomfory
[4:00:39] <%AncelDeLambert> Pat is right to need that
[4:00:40] <Goraka91> You what
[4:00:40] <+Dasbubba> The radio starts giving you quests.
[4:00:41] <+Ciphris> pat needs someone to hold his hand
[4:00:44] <pittsnoggle1> I notice as I get older I like my games less and less sandboxy @AngriestPat
[4:00:45] <%mugwugsampoo> QUESTS ABOUT TO START
[4:00:46] <%Hollandiae> the people demand discomfort
[4:00:47] <%DavidSanChan> pat is a k'nex kid
[4:00:50] <ggharasser> Is anxiety contagious?
[4:00:51] <Mr_Strut> Try Miasmata. It is a nice game about picking flowers.
[4:00:53] <%PenmanLupine> tell us what Paige said about the Lego story
[4:00:56] <luis_verde7> Dance monkey, dance and explore the ocean!
[4:01:00] <Desertfishing> he should play Stardew Valley for chill stream
[4:01:00] <%Cavumentum> KH Franchise Chronological Order Stream!
[4:01:05] <%SweetCheeksTrap> @AngriestPat Apparently the game does give you more direction after some wait timers go off, if that helps
[4:01:08] <nikwritesstuff> if it's a sandbox but underwater does it mean it's mudquarium?
[4:01:08] <TalisKanju> Fuck Xenosaga Ep. 2 that game is shit
[4:01:08] <sonofthedeepsouth> A little shit
[4:01:09] <$ElenaManetta> NO I THREW LEGOS ON THE GROUND AND DEMANDED VIDEO GAMES
[4:01:09] <%SulfurousAcid> PAT WOULD MAKE CUUUUBES
[4:01:11] <AnAsianToaster> minecraft is less a game and more a relaxer for me

[4:01:34] <sonofthedeepsouth> THE TISM

[4:01:36] <Sakisin> Pat, the radio was JUST FIXED, it tells you where to go.
[4:01:36] <The_Blumper> INSTRUCTIONS
[4:01:36] <%PenmanLupine> I liked to buy 2 of those sets. 1 to do it the right way, then another to just do what I want with it.
[4:01:37] <%Caidezes> Me too, Pat. Me too.
[4:01:38] <Cobaltor_252> so open-ended games are a no-no then?
[4:01:38] <thewhiterice92> Oh, so you're a psychopath
[4:01:38] <skyrile9> That is an objectively wrong way to play with legos
[4:01:38] <Nordguy> I would make a lot of pyramids
[4:01:39] <rosencruez> minecraft is just digital legos
[4:01:39] <Laicuss> NO IMAGINATION
[4:01:40] <DrMoose7> LAME
[4:01:40] <$Hiro01231> Instruction buddies
[4:01:41] <Inebriateddonut> Wow

[4:01:42] <weeters> SOULLESS
[4:01:42] <+trnzero> i made temples and shit
[4:01:43] <MasterTonberry23> You're no master builder!
[4:01:43] <luis_verde7> The TISMs
[4:01:43] <Indeimaus> understadable
[4:01:45] <mrjohncarlton> Pat would always "beat" Lego
[4:01:45] <$ElenaManetta> YOU ARE LITERALLY PRESIDENT BUSINESS.
[4:01:45] <poweredscoot> WRONG
[4:01:47] <%AncelDeLambert> yep
[4:01:47] <TalisKanju> Pat: Creativity is for chumps
[4:01:47] <CookieCutter007> NO IMAGINATION
[4:01:48] <$cureneckbeard> Lawful Neutral
[4:01:48] <+Shaggnar> WHY ARE YOU LIKE THIS?
[4:01:48] <+Echelon_94> do you hate Breath of the Wild too?
[4:01:50] <Darthkitten_Prime> That explains so much
[4:01:50] <+TheSchmidtOne> I do the exact same thing .
[4:01:51] <Zeemod155> That's how you're supposed to play with legos tho
[4:01:51] <%theblackgoddess> you just like to follow rules
[4:01:52] <$SirG005E> yeah but this game gives you direction
[4:01:52] <%OwlLightningMage> It was getting to the direction
[4:01:52] <%BDKatsumaru> Pat confirmed for gunpla?
[4:01:53] <HerrDemsus> the game gives objectives kinda
[4:01:53] <coltdemont> Thats literally inside the autism specter
[4:01:53] <+democrazyyy> KINGDOM HEARTS FULL SERIES STREAM
[4:01:53] <keksisblyat> Pat.... pat..... why
[4:01:54] <%Dragonfang1337> but there's direction to subnut though
[4:01:54] <Cthulos> Nice Rhythm Heaven shirt,Pat
[4:01:54] <bananagourmet> NO BUT THERE'S A STORYLINE
[4:01:55] <%coreywin1> You could just copy other builds
[4:01:55] <%Keyd00d> I now understand Pat
[4:01:55] <The_Blumper> I also, only follow the instructions
[4:01:55] <ebonifragaria> Noooooo that's not what it meant
[4:01:55] <%MahoganyVince> You're like a Resident Evil zombie
[4:01:57] <RottenK> CHAOS CHAOS
[4:01:57] <+seaearthandsky> LUL
[4:01:57] <%Youwereeatenbyalid> @AngriestPat LITERALLY LORD BUSINESS FROM THE LEGO MOVIE
[4:01:58] <%WheatlyXT> Pat: But tell me what to build game
[4:01:58] <sennoh> no creativity LUL
[4:01:59] <smallboops> this is pats version of woolies grind aversion
[4:01:59] <sileo_patronus> Pat does not like to have agency
[4:01:59] <rosabellamelantha> @AngriestPat the game has a story though
[4:01:59] <+Weapon901> But the game has an end goal
[4:01:59] <%FrostMass22> Pat is President Business
[4:02:00] <+cvp5127> but it has to be perfect
[4:02:00] <nolifegamin> man I'm like the opposite of Pat
[4:02:01] <$SirG005E> it gives you direction though
[4:02:02] <$SirG005E> lol
[4:02:02] <321Continue> I 100% AGREE
[4:02:02] <$ElenaManetta> PLAY DON'T STARVE IT'S SUPER RELAXING
[4:02:02] <+Nomicro4u> DO IT IN VR PUSSY
[4:02:02] <%Hollandiae> Oof
[4:02:03] <%megamonmon123> PRESIDENT BUSINESS PAT
[4:02:03] <%TheMilhouseExperience> Because you lack creativity.
[4:02:03] <luis_verde7> Dat SPECTRUM
[4:02:04] <%dizilicious> Subnautica has big goals
[4:02:04] <%OwlLightningMage> They meant the start of the missions and direction
[4:02:04] <+GreenBrains_> no childhood = no immagination
[4:02:04] <%Rngiddion> I mean Subnautica has beginning to end story progression
[4:02:05] <%AncelDeLambert> LUL
[4:02:05] <%RilsRislan> It's really fucking good
[4:02:05] <ebonifragaria> It does have direction!
[4:02:05] <+TheDude8D> that's okay play what you like
[4:02:05] <booglesnurf> Xenosaga 1 had promise, X ep2 was trash and 3 was a crippled mystery meat
[4:02:06] <Desertfishing> its all good
[4:02:06] <XdaXcaptainX> it was afun
[4:02:06] <%tank7013> @AngriestPat Pat the game was literally about to tell you what to do. That's what the radio is for
[4:02:07] <%brackboi> warframe!!!!
[4:02:07] <+Rararachan> I do the same thing, but they do start giving you missions and direction
[4:02:07] <%RilsRislan> WHAT'S IMPORTANT
[4:02:07] <%TrispyCrispy> aw man :(
[4:02:08] <%Prism_Wing> You become dead Leon?
[4:02:08] <$antibonehurtingjuice> If IIda was a person
[4:02:08] <CaptainKarite> Super cool
[4:02:09] <Kemmybelle> If you do decide to give Subnautica another go, maybe play in Freedom or Creative mode.
[4:02:09] <rosabellamelantha> @AngriestPat the game has a BIG STORY though pat
[4:02:09] <Sakisin> Sure pat, sure.
[4:02:10] <$awsomesaucekirby> Pat has no ambition or imagination
[4:02:11] <%dorthafiq> How about Dragonquest Builders then Pat, that game is BUILT on using instructions to build stuff
[4:02:11] <%Reizie_Etherealm> DEFINITIVE!
[4:02:12] <%legendfather_of_giants> @AngriestPat you JUST fixed the direction machine
[4:02:12] <%SaltyDongs> COME ON PATTTTTTTT
[4:02:12] <%QueequegTheater> @AngriestPat You were about to start getting the missions and story
[4:02:12] <$MightyMaxT> open open world is terrifying
[4:02:13] <+JackMillerTime> too many option anxiety, to many things to plan
[4:02:13] <+lethallunacyx> I'm the opposite I like to be adventurous

[4:02:16] <nina9669> pats lego movie villain confirmed!?
[4:02:16] <itesket> ok.
[4:02:16] <%TheMilhouseExperience> It’s fine.
[4:02:17] <%kreegmeyer> my two brothers DESTROYED all my Bionicles and legos and hurt my fuckin soul, they were all PERFECT, AND NOW THEY ARE TRASh apatMenace
[4:02:17] <+cuttlecrow> I understand Pat's fears though
[4:02:17] <%furiousfurioso> @AngriestPat this game actually does have direction, after certain timers go off you get directed to other distress call locations and stuff
[4:02:18] <%OwlLightningMage> It has missions and directions
[4:02:18] <%Fizzeism> What you doin now Pat?
[4:02:18] <%Breakfast_Megapowers> So you are the father from the Lego movie? @AngriestPat
[4:02:18] <%gnarly_memes_bro> @AngriestPat I feel the same about survival games but i love making lego bullshit castles

[4:02:21] <Sparty9112> Pat is an enormous C O W A R D
[4:02:21] <%PROUD2beGINGER> Story is a strong word
[4:02:21] <%SuperCasualBoom> cheer200 If Pat was in a real life scenario of Suburuhypnotica, he wouldn’t be grasping on being surround by waters, he be worried he couldn’t craft Red Bulls.
[4:02:22] <+trnzero> pat's just making excuses for being unable to make goals for himself Kappa
[4:02:22] <%sparrrow_> Guys it's okay to not like a game
[4:02:23] <%trainer_jon> at least you tried
[4:02:24] <Warbot40> I literally got a lego architeture set for christmas. Buckingham palace.
[4:02:25] <%RilsRislan> IT'S FREE IF YOU GET THE EPIC LAUNCHER
[4:02:26] <ggharasser> We used to take bricks and wheels and make vehicles and smash them together to see which one is the sturdiest.
[4:02:27] <+dickbuttwoman> @AngriestPat If you need direction, read the sonic comic!

[4:06:28] <%trainer_jon> maybe
[4:06:28] <frozenottsel> maybe
[4:06:28] <bananagourmet> it is, but subnautica's better
[4:06:28] <+TheDude8D> PLEASE No
[4:06:29] <%Youwereeatenbyalid> @AngriestPat yeah but not really
[4:06:29] <%texaporte> yeah kinda
[4:06:29] <%rumtumtugnutz> you'd like nms more
[4:06:29] <Darthkitten_Prime> Dunno.
[4:06:29] <moonsaber99> No
[4:06:29] <%TheSniperJoe> No Man's Sky is WAAAAAY better now.
[4:06:29] <%battlefield900> no
[4:06:30] <+Shaggnar> Better, but not great
[4:06:30] <IntrepidEye> its a game now. not a good game but a game
[4:06:30] <+Flambage> Dab for us you puppet @AngriestPat
[4:06:30] <$KnivesEve> not gonna lie. subnotica looked boring to me.

[4:06:30] <%Hollandiae> DO IT
[4:06:31] <Ropcord> VoteYea
[4:06:32] <foreverN2dust> N O
[4:06:32] <MrSyne> yes and no
[4:06:33] <%RilsRislan> SUBNAUTICA ISN'T PROCEDURAL
[4:06:33] <%sunriser696> IS BIG FIXED NOW
[4:06:35] <Skybrid> It's a lot better
[4:06:35] <SkullyIsDie> it is
[4:06:35] <DXLelouch24> i wont watch NMS
[4:06:36] <+dickbuttwoman> @AngriestPat KINDA, but it's essentially just subnautica in space
[4:06:37] <%zombinedotrar> better but still shit
[4:06:37] <%Caidezes> It's better.
[4:06:38] <%mortalitas87> it turned into okay instead of terrible
[4:06:40] <$Bt_Robot> Still terrible
[4:06:40] <%RilsRislan> IT'S HAND CRAFTED
[4:06:41] <+cuttlecrow> how is no mans sky up your alley and this isnt
[4:06:41] <%aishman> The inventory problem is BIGGER in No Man Sky than Subnautica
[4:06:42] <%Faustgesicht> @AngriestPat go ahead and play off screen to acclimate if you need to
[4:06:43] <$cureneckbeard> more like NO GUY BUY
[4:06:45] <Dvvolf> it's ok but if you had problem playing subnautica i can't see how you would be able to play no man's sky
[4:06:46] <yumiya13> GREEDY
[4:06:47] <%aishman> IT'S THE FUCKING WORST
[4:06:47] <+zcrawford22> No Man's Sky is infinitely better than at release, but it's still just okay
[4:06:49] <+Bupkis7> No Man’s Sky is good
[4:06:50] <+Crazysteve6547> @AngriestPat Talos Principal Gives you 100% direction
[4:06:55] <Skybrid> Anti-NMS circlejerk ensues
[4:06:55] <Shastafield> LUL no
[4:06:55] <rosabellamelantha> Subnautica is super set and made by hand @AngriestPat
[4:06:57] <%Hollandiae> Space is just a less scary ocean
[4:06:57] <$ElenaManetta> YOU DON'T SHARE YOUR FINANCES? what a bad couple
[4:07:01] <%Archphronimos> no man's sky is SO MUCH BETTER
[4:07:02] <+cuttlecrow> "so I've been grinding off screen..."
[4:07:03] <Worldbrand> That makes sense
[4:07:05] <TalisKanju> Pat's gonna spend all the donation money on POUTINE
[4:07:08] <yumiya13> the grind
[4:07:09] <%Fruitywhompus> confidence
[4:07:10] <$SirG005E> use moue and keyboard if you play it again
[4:07:11] <Darthkitten_Prime> That makes sense.
[4:07:14] <FstSergeant8595> @cuttlecrow LOL
[4:07:18] <Worldbrand> Yeah it would be great to see you come back after you start a base or something
[4:07:18] <+Mikatonic> you could also just not play it
[4:07:19] <Desertfishing> it gets better as you go on
[4:07:21] <sparkboy777> @AngriestPat i HIGHLY suggest playing subnautica in freedom mode without the food and water meter's on your first playthrough.
[4:07:24] <fairore> @cuttlecrow lmao
[4:07:31] <+Huxenberg> !uptime
[4:07:31] <@Moobot> I've been playing this game for how long? Oh only 4h 7m 33s.
[4:07:33] <SubjectX07x> Okay, so judging by chat it's clear that No Man's Sky is better, but it has such a bad reputation that a lot of people will still just call it shit.
[4:07:34] <%galaxyswirl> "so you guys might have noticed i look a little different..."
