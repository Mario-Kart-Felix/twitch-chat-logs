[0:01:09] <NastiCrimeboy> Hey everyone!
[0:01:20] <causewaybob> Yoooo party people
[0:01:21] <%abelincoln_catpuncher> abelincoln_catpuncher subscribed at Tier 1. They've subscribed for 2 months! Pat you're such a shithead to Woolie. I love it
[0:01:24] <+kullumanati> 5 plus hours. Jesus
[0:01:25] <old_dog_god> What’s good gamers
[0:01:29] <%saadi90> I just can’t with Woolie ...
[0:01:31] <Fluffy_Tamamo> Patricia refuses to blink once again.
[0:01:38] <bob900000> pat please destroy woolie on Monday
[0:01:40] <reonome> here to watch pat dunk on woolie
[0:01:41] <vapidq> lol what did woolie say? i didnt tune in
[0:01:49] <%holydeviant1> I think the last third of the game is my favourite and can be summed up with "Oh yeah. It;s all coming together."
[0:01:50] <vVAstrAVv> pat i hope you show no mercy to woolie Monday over this ff shit lol
[0:02:08] <%TombstoneTTromboners> Woolie: "Yes, I DON'T LISTEN"
[0:02:08] <kozboz96> @vapidq hes skipping all ff14 content just wanting nier shit he claps when he sees it and ignores all context
[0:02:14] <%saadi90> I can’t wait for Monday!
[0:02:19] <%holydeviant1> "Let's jut watch the raids" was probably Woolie's greatest mistake
[0:02:20] <causewaybob> Is woolie philosophizing on every question?
[0:02:27] <%abelincoln_catpuncher> who else is here after that nonsense?
[0:02:44] <vVAstrAVv> o/

[0:03:04] <%walternatorz> I think Pat was taking notes just to thoroughly dunk on Woolie on Monday
[0:03:21] <%BappoTheMighty> I can't wait until Woolie and Reggie get to talking to Klasja up on the roof.
[0:03:24] <causewaybob> Ahhh woolie can’t mmo
[0:03:35] <DaKnightWarrior> That FF14 stream was too good.
[0:03:35] <%Aeoneth> Aeoneth subscribed at Tier 1. They've subscribed for 27 months! Hey Pat,  Thanks for phoning Woolie during his FF14 stream just to blow him up live.  That took an already enjoyable stream (from an FF outsider) and turned it into something magical
[0:03:41] <%CoffeeKaiju> CoffeeKaiju subscribed at Tier 1. They've subscribed for 3 months! Hi Pat! cant wait to watch you play Village! Thanks again for the content, King!
[0:03:51] <%YakumoYomi> I only pop in every now and then, since I don't play FFXIV. Been mostly using it as background noise while I do Rise's new content
[0:03:56] <%holydeviant1> @causewaybob Let;s be fair if you never played an MMO and tuned into an endgame FF raid you'd be a little confused too
[0:04:02] <%holydeviant1> "why is the floor made of neon"
[0:04:18] <Sol_Install> time for pat fun
[0:04:37] <%Bailey__gaming> Yo Pat :D was laughing my ass off during the woollie stream with the shinnanigans!
[0:04:39] <Broken_Sonex> So Woolie is literally just going "Hey! I know what that is! I don't know why it's here, but I'll clap because i know what it is!"
[0:04:51] <causewaybob> @holydeviant1 while that is a fair point but it’s still fun to make fun of the internet man

[1:00:27] <+upandadam> consider that you might miss passive checks!!
[1:00:27] <+purps26> omg yes
[1:00:29] <FutureCopLGF> CALCULUS
[1:00:29] <sirtommygunn> you can just use them for unlocking white checks
[1:00:30] <+ReallyBigRocks> What do you need to retry the sandwich check?
[1:00:33] <Kiso52> Kiso52 subscribed at Tier 1. 
[1:00:36] <peyodogo> inland inland inland

[1:00:37] <elshadow7> 6 is good.
[1:00:41] <%ssjklyco> Max inland empire
[1:00:42] <42nfl19> Why not wait to level up after a failed skill check? @PatStaresAt
[1:00:42] <yourliteraldog> composure
[1:00:43] <%cobalt_phoenix_> wait how is perception at 10??
[1:00:45] <%DiscoMatador> I would put some into composure for sure
[1:00:47] <sirtommygunn> what white checks are already locked?
[1:00:47] <%thomassolorio> what do you need to retry the sandwich xheck
[1:00:47] <%illusiveSaint> and open some checks
[1:00:48] <+purps26> more levels are more hidden checks
[1:00:52] <%Jeshk0> Composure would def be good
[1:00:53] <+JustToWatch> one into espirit de corps?
[1:00:53] <%Alazull> Max out Endurance and Volition
[1:00:53] <+senfood> Holy shit, your composure

[1:00:57] <tattleworm> if you get suggestion to 4, we can finish that thought you had about your name right at the start of the game
[1:00:58] <@StridentSong> Honestly, I'd save some points for when you fail a white check
[1:00:59] <%hax_metatron> Or fill up some lower stats
[1:01:00] <%bassoontyphoon> Always check what needs doing before you level up stats
[1:01:01] <+zinris> needs more composure

[1:01:06] <oda_flobunaga> NO
[1:01:06] <%hax_metatron> Or try to
[1:01:10] <%illusiveSaint> leave one available for checks
[1:01:10] <ingman112> 6 is good to pass most checks, 8 if you REALLY wanna get crazy
[1:01:11] <%hax_metatron> Not necessary
[1:01:11] <cardamomo88> NOOO
[1:01:14] <@commanderclaw> Yeah, save points for failed checks or do Hand Eye a bit
[1:01:16] <@StridentSong> You can use the points to bump a stat to try the check again
[1:01:16] <%torusendor> Get the low shit high
[1:01:16] <Blank9> your inland will be good at 8
[1:01:16] <17sevens> no
[1:01:19] <%emperordread> Hoarding points is bad because you will be doing hidden, passive checks ALL THE TIME. Smoke em if you got em
[1:01:24] <%ssjklyco> Go full Twin Peaks
[1:01:25] <nakpack> put a point into hand/eye

[1:20:28] <magboost> The Expresion
[1:20:32] <Ariddic> the expression returns
[1:20:33] <The48thCrow> @s_xylocalsingles Kim never says he's a subordinate, I figured he let you lead cause how could you lead Harry
[1:20:34] <PartyFavors> @Broken_Sonex We already did her work

[1:20:40] <%Jeshk0> does pat still have the expression?
[1:20:52] <cumurasame> @Broken_Sonex you could, if you didn't do the Jam quest, but doing that helps you with the Titus checks
[1:21:00] <T_Sasquatch> We're really witnessing a future classic
[1:21:03] <%Ranryu692> @Jeshk0 yes, but he shaved
[1:21:04] <%Blackleafx> Harrier, as in the police dog
[1:21:11] <%muXPerience> Hunter of the Woods
[1:21:11] <kikoeru_san> Okay, here we go, Pat is approaching the church of cool ass lore
[1:21:19] <%toolofparanoia> HE IDENTIFIES AS A HARRIER
[1:21:23] <%squidking96> Patrick Du Bois

[1:21:32] <%Ranryu692> isn't it such a good detail?
[1:21:34] <%Broken_Sonex> @Broken_Sonex Yeah but if you found it first you can tell her to fuck off right?
[1:21:35] <T_Sasquatch> Hmmm

[1:22:23] <LordOfThePoultry> SUPERCOP
[1:22:26] <%toolofparanoia> TRULY SUPERCOP
[1:22:27] <%JoshManVGH> Huh, could have taken a deskjob.
[1:22:35] <%illusiveSaint> declined promotion seems so bsllr4
[1:22:46] <ShichiNoBushi> Could have still wanted to do field work.
[1:22:50] <+Grabnok> @Gespens Only SLIGHTLY
[1:23:00] <yourliteraldog> He is bad GOOD COP
[1:23:01] <The48thCrow> teenagers
[1:23:02] <%JoshManVGH> In essence. but declination might be the same as not getting promoted
[1:23:08] <%Alazull> We only technically outrank Kim
[1:23:11] <$RealThiele> kinky yiffer
[1:23:13] <%JoshManVGH> or not
[1:23:14] <%Blackleafx> Thanks Authority :)
[1:23:15] <derap41> That's why he's been very nice
[1:23:16] <The48thCrow> Oh shit
[1:23:19] <%Ranryu692> remember: your partner is a satellite officer
[1:23:22] <%Blackleafx> Harry has a police prestige class
[1:23:22] <$BlackMage66652> 1
[1:23:27] <%Nordguy> 3
[1:23:30] <fuji_92> 1
[1:23:31] <oda_flobunaga> We have more time in grade than Kim effectively
[1:23:38] <DeepSearch27> 3
[1:23:40] <+kewlmyc> 1
[1:23:40] <+Grabnok> regardless of your shit mental state, you're his superior. He has to let you take the lead
[1:23:41] <%holydeviant1> (Don't forget your gun later tonight, Pat)
[1:23:41] <rekinom> 2
[1:23:41] <Yakobro> 2
[1:23:45] <fuji_92> 3
[1:23:49] <aiutare47> Harry's got some master ranks
[1:23:50] <+kewlmyc> COWARD
[1:23:54] <%walternatorz> Kim doesn't care about you. He only cares about AUTHORITY.
[1:24:01] <Yakobro> oof 3
[1:24:02] <Ids560> he actually gives a good reason when you say that
[1:24:02] <nakpack> 1
[1:24:05] <cumurasame> 2 is actually a good response, Kim is very good about it
[1:24:11] <DeepSearch27> 2
[1:24:11] <%illusiveSaint> you only need to prove you EARNED the rank, not really accept it
[1:24:17] <%walternatorz> Pat is too afraid to ask Kim how he really feels.
[1:24:19] <+croten> I think 1 is a very good responce
[1:24:20] <+anovertmoose> I <3 Kim so much
[1:24:21] <+Grabnok> @walternatorz Not true at all. Bad first impression, tho
[1:24:26] <+croten> very wholesome
[1:24:33] <%bread_assassin> Kim has a genuinely nice response if you do, though.
[1:24:40] <Estwilde> This game is a really wonderful journey
[1:24:55] <UnsteadyFunk> I've known Kim for 5 minutes but if anything happened to him I would not take it lightly
[1:24:56] <The48thCrow> This game is legit art
[1:25:02] <aiutare47> so this is recent
[1:25:04] <The48thCrow> put this game in the louvre
[1:25:07] <LordOfThePoultry> yikes
[1:25:07] <Estwilde> I can really feel the Planescape. Finding yourself again
[1:25:11] <$RealThiele> oof
[1:25:13] <aiutare47> all of this is a recent downward spiral
[1:25:14] <+titansloth93> The sheer volume of voice acting just grows more and more impressive
[1:25:15] <cumurasame> Four Months to REALLY deal damage to yourself

[1:26:52] <%bread_assassin> MODS
[1:26:54] <cumurasame> there's no spoiler wrapping in twitch, why did you think that was a good idea
[1:26:57] <%holydeviant1> Guys, don't let him forget the gun! If you miss the app on the day you make it, I think you can't get it!
[1:26:57] <The48thCrow> @Broken_Sonex why point out a spoiler to the streamer
[1:26:58] <ingman112> Yeah NO SHIT
[1:27:00] <+Gespens> you shouldn't have said it in the first place!
[1:27:01] <$BlackMage66652> @Grabnok Fuck you
[1:27:05] <%neroforte177> wait does Pat have mods??
[1:27:06] <+FanServ> @Grabnok literally pointless
[1:27:07] <yourliteraldog> That was very not cash money of you
[1:27:07] <+icekept> kim is the best
[1:27:09] <+polothegreatest> Spoilers?
[1:27:09] <17sevens> don't say spoilers at all maybe, not complicated concept
[1:27:11] <+FoolsArcade> @Grabnok Just don't put spoilers at all ffs
[1:27:11] <%Dr_DangerPhD> if you had to put a warning maybe just shut the fuck up instead
[1:27:14] <+titansloth93> ok moving alone
[1:27:14] <T_Sasquatch> People just can't keep their shit to fhemsekves
[1:27:19] <%Broken_Sonex> @Grabnok FUCK OFF
[1:27:19] <T_Sasquatch> Just shut up
[1:27:23] <peyodogo> @Grabnok yeah but what if your eyes catch the spoiler before the warning? can that shit, dude
[1:27:27] <%GalacticaPhanto> damn one guy getting murdered
[1:27:27] <Tuna_Can_0> thats some high level ignorance atpCap holy shit
[1:27:28] <%illusiveSaint> the tie volution and Kim are ho your true bros
[1:27:32] <+Grabnok> @cumurasame i wanted to put spaces in and it didn't work as i wanted. again, ya'll are correct to be upset
[1:27:36] <%Blackleafx> No mods around?
[1:27:37] <AhmCha> oh no did Pat get spoiled
[1:27:47] <pokefan9956> uh oh
[1:27:49] <%Alazull> Nah, he missed that
[1:27:50] <arcade0416> no, just a close call
[1:27:50] <+Grabnok> i'm not a very frequent watcher of streams
[1:27:51] <%Blackleafx> @illusiveSaint Esprit de Corps is a bro too sometime
[1:27:51] <cumurasame> Pat didn't see it
[1:27:51] <AvroEltz> good he is getting shat on, should be perma banned
[1:27:53] <peyodogo> nah, i dont think pat caught it, just us
[1:27:53] <17sevens> no indication pat saw
[1:27:53] <+FanServ> @Grabnok even if it worked as you wanted, it would be wrong LUL
[1:27:55] <cumurasame> so that's a blessing
[1:27:57] <%holydeviant1> One guy getting murdered while the streamer isn't watching, he comes back, we all whislin' with bloody crowbars
[1:27:58] <%Mr_Pylon> I think Pat missed it
[1:28:00] <+FoolsArcade> if Pat got spoiled he's gonna be fucking pissed
[1:28:00] <bettysharkface> If it needs spoilers, you shouldn't say it
[1:28:00] <ingman112> If a mod doesn't respond we just gotta make sure that shit stays BURIED
[1:28:02] <%Alazull> And I don't think he's been carefully looking at chat anyway
[1:28:03] <T_Sasquatch> "I have no brain and I must spoil " looking ass
[1:28:09] <+projectmanatees> Clean the chat so no spoilers post <3 for Kim instead
[1:28:10] <%emperordread> That was a quick piss bro, good work

[1:28:25] <LordOfThePoultry> no mods apparently
[1:28:26] <%Blackleafx> @Grabnok spoiled the final arc of the game

[1:58:27] <%Monkeyweed21> Is Cuno just Pat's brother?
[1:58:27] <ingman112> Things in the bookstore to steal
[1:58:38] <bionicwillpower> Protip: pump encyclopedia and go to the docks
[1:58:39] <%Kataguro> Cuno pumps shit stats to 12
[1:58:44] <+aslfrasle> Is Cuno just a younger Pat's Brother?
[1:58:44] <arcade0416> almost makes you wonder if the short term harm of giving him speed is maybe worth the long-run trust he'd have in you...damn hard choice, don't see that often enough in games

[2:22:44] <Rellim80> Pat needs a bad hat
[2:22:45] <%Jeshk0> was that the balcony smoker inside?
[2:22:45] <derap41> Dick Mullen has a good hat
[2:22:50] <aiutare47> Outer Wilds was hella forgettable
[2:22:54] <Tisaric> excuse me?

[2:23:15] <ingman112> Probably some new stuff in 2 as well
[2:23:17] <%Kataguro> Entered into The Beast
[2:23:17] <+emperri> Mr. Evrart is helping you find your gun
[2:23:21] <%dalmek> @aiutare47 do you mean Outer Worlds, the game that's like Fallout kinda, or Outer Wilds the space exploration one?
[2:23:22] <%Deft_Thought> That reminds me, I haven't started playing the The Outer Worlds yet
[2:23:26] <aiutare47> WAIT WRONG ONE
[2:23:27] <sirtommygunn> Outer Wilds set off my existential dread pretty bad

[2:24:02] <PartyFavors> Probably a good idea; art thoughts give XP
[2:24:03] <marcomatame> Outer Wilds was the most terryfying game I've ever played for the first 10 hours
[2:24:07] <+Jiggisnipe> I love that people still mix up Outer Wilds and Outer Worlds
[2:24:11] <peyodogo> the starting shirt adds conceptualization, it just also diminishes suggestion bc it stinky
[2:24:23] <%jorniev> @Jiggisnipe its so funny

[2:24:41] <+emperri> The Outer Whatever that was the not-fallout was kinda meh
[2:24:42] <+JobbedBone> talking to the sea > talking to plants
[2:24:43] <aiutare47> Goddamn that naming was evil, The fake fallout one I forgot I even played, the awesome space exploration one was a very unique concept

[3:02:12] <+mczarklesby> That's fair. Necktie is cool like that.
[3:02:15] <Blank9> I was always afraid my tie wouldn't talk in dialogue if I kept it off.
[3:02:20] <oda_flobunaga> never go north pls
[3:02:23] <%Kataguro> Pat wasn't prepared for Butt Chugging to be in an actual video game
[3:02:23] <Blank9> But I'm not 100% sure if it works like that.

[3:02:41] <vilecrois> Abigal, eat beans with me
[3:02:43] <SolSwagGuy56> i am the law
[3:02:48] <+JobbedBone> I wish the tie would never talk again if you took it off, to penalize gaming it since its so special

[3:21:32] <%Grimlockfly> 'i'm going to solve it, dora!' .... ouch
[3:21:33] <Ids560> he was the kinda guy to fellate his gun in front of strangers before the start of the game
[3:21:34] <Psyramics> lets... lets loot some spare change... thats always a good time...
[3:21:34] <+CloudsBringRain> this game does such a fantastic job at making you feel uncomfortable in all the right ways
[3:21:35] <fritz_dacat> Solving this case is the only thing he has
[3:21:35] <+fugatlas> i appreciate that the game makes it clear you can't "fix" harry. Not in the like week of his life this takes place at least

[3:26:26] <ingman112> We'll help you out if you miss stuff
[3:26:26] <Alfred_Waaghur> You can go further north up the boardwalk.
[3:26:27] <%illusiveSaint> you're not done with boardwalk go back
[3:26:29] <peyodogo> god i still havent recovered from that fuckin call
[3:26:30] <Blank9> it's where you're supposed to meet tonight too
[3:26:34] <%Monkeyweed21> @PatStaresAt you missed a dead end
[3:26:35] <%toolofparanoia> hey a guy and a kid
[3:26:37] <aiutare47> is this important?
[3:26:37] <$metzselaar> relax guys... every time
[3:26:44] <aiutare47> I almost remember this
[3:26:45] <%hax_metatron> I hope he passes the check here
[3:26:47] <%jorniev> lot of space to the left
[3:26:56] <%Jeshk0> a totally normal guy
[3:26:57] <%VyperVic> Go back to boardwalk, if not now, later
[3:26:58] <ingman112> @hax_metatron I hope not at first tbh
[3:27:03] <oda_flobunaga> @Monkeyweed21 bum dun tsssh
[3:27:09] <EvolNom> @patstaresat Hey just wanted to say your podcast gets me through work man. You’re awesome man
[3:27:14] <The48thCrow> This game makes me want to cry all the time
[3:27:30] <%jorniev> damn
[3:27:36] <+emperri> Oh yeah go to the end of the boardwalk we need a pick-me-up after the phone call LUL
[3:27:36] <%jorniev> ALWAYS ON POINT
[3:27:48] <derap41> +2 tho
[3:27:50] <penitentpendant> That weird bonus
[3:27:50] <+GingerStrawhat> Has anyone told Pat where the Point of no return is yet? Cause he's coming up on it soo if he gets in this building
[3:27:53] <ingman112> Go for it
[3:27:54] <%Kataguro> One of the only 20s in the game
[3:27:55] <%illusiveSaint> talk to dude first
[3:27:55] <Visorak6> Later, pat
[3:27:56] <%TheLakinessMonster> Can you boost with chat?
[3:27:57] <akitanito> +2 did nothing
[3:27:58] <+upandadam> better level it up
[3:27:59] <%VyperVic> oh shit, the call helps!?
[3:28:00] <Ids560> change
[3:28:01] <17sevens> make the check anyway
[3:28:01] <bettysharkface> That's why you needed Hobocop, Pat.
[3:28:03] <+JobbedBone> its white
[3:28:09] <aiutare47> @PatStaresAt Remember a 3% check means you need to do something else first
[3:28:11] <Tisaric> cool that the call helps out
[3:28:11] <%bevyrage> keep doing stuff around the area and it'll increase your chance of success on this skill check btw
[3:28:12] <ingman112> @GingerStrawhat The game will warn him, as will we
[3:28:12] <%illusiveSaint> atpCap
[3:28:19] <+AWKWARDL0SER> ...probably for the best
[3:28:19] <%jorniev> for later
[3:28:22] <+emperri> @GingerStrawhat idk someone could and probably 5 people would cry about it and a mod would time you out
[3:28:25] <%Broken_Sonex> Who could play as Harry in a movie?
[3:28:34] <+fugatlas> That shivers check is the only hard required one in the game, iirc
[3:28:38] <ingman112> @emperri That is accurate, yes
[3:28:47] <Press_X_ToJASON> @TheLakinessMonster not effectively, the highest he could get with a 12 is 18, and he needed 20, so even with another point, hed still need the "always wins" 12
[3:28:48] <+GingerStrawhat> Okay cause I missed kims warning the first time I played and only realised it after the fact
[3:28:49] <penitentpendant> Psychic Cop!
[3:28:51] <aiutare47> @Broken_Sonex no one, a movie is a bad idea
[3:28:54] <bettysharkface> @Broken_Sonex The cop from Stranger Things.
[3:28:55] <%Jeshk0> @Broken_Sonex michael shannon
[3:29:14] <+JobbedBone> hmmm
[3:29:15] <%Broken_Sonex> @Jeshk0 That's the guy.
[3:29:27] <%TheLakinessMonster> @TheLakinessMonster Thanks for breaking down the numbers! psaUp
[3:29:45] <%Jeshk0> harry is kinda similar to van alden from boardwalk empire honestly
[3:29:51] <user_naim> I wonder if a movie could capture the casual player-insert tone of the ”normal” dialogue
[3:30:00] <Nohorse> Doesn't look like talking to the wind turned out well for Harry
[3:30:05] <%Broken_Sonex> @Broken_Sonex I never said anything about making it jesus....
[3:30:09] <ingman112> This sorta feels like a "game-only" experience
[3:30:12] <%bevyrage> pat didn't finish exploring the boardwalk didn't he
[3:30:22] <ingman112> He'll get back to it
[3:30:26] <akitanito> not yet
[3:30:27] <aiutare47> @user_naim I dont believe it could at all, this is a story that works almost exclusively as a playable novel
[3:30:33] <%VyperVic> @bevyrage he did not
[3:30:36] <%bevyrage> kei
[3:30:40] <+Jiggisnipe> there are too many options and routes for this to be condensed into a movie
[3:30:40] <penitentpendant> @bevyrage TBF, it LOOKs like an unexplorable dead end
[3:30:43] <%bevyrage> had to step away for a second and thought i missed it
[3:30:45] <Nohorse> Aww
[3:31:01] <cumurasame> how about making this an FMV game?
[3:31:04] <%muXPerience> what about a movie like jamrock saints
[3:31:06] <user_naim> @aiutare47 I think so yeah
[3:31:10] <derap41> ...that's not good
[3:31:14] <peyodogo> yall talking about a movie like it's a hypothetical, but you do know there is a tv show coming that's based on this game don't you
[3:31:15] <%Blackleafx> Shooting is more than just eyesight, yeah
[3:31:15] <+JobbedBone> they wouldn't make it the game, it would be like " a martinaise story" or something
[3:31:22] <Nohorse> Get in the line like the rest of us, Pat
[3:31:26] <%Cykron> KISS HIM
[3:31:27] <fritz_dacat> Kim is the great
[3:31:27] <oda_flobunaga> yep
[3:31:31] <bettysharkface> His jacket gives him a bonus to hand eye coordination.
[3:31:33] <saraizarai> Kim is legit the best
[3:31:35] <aiutare47> 7/10 depending on range is just fine
[3:31:36] <Tisaric> there's more to the right as well
[3:31:44] <fritz_dacat> So the left has more options than the right ..humm
[3:31:45] <+emperri> "There's a lot more to the left than I expected!" - communist
[3:31:45] <%Broken_Sonex> @peyodogo What's it called?
[3:31:49] <%Cykron> Level Suggestion so you can suggest making out with him on the boardwalk
[3:31:52] <oda_flobunaga> dig up
[3:31:56] <Nohorse> The boardwalk NotLikeThis
[3:31:57] <%jorniev> ooooooh

[3:32:05] <aiutare47> @peyodogo what an awful idea

[3:32:08] <+emperri> monkaS

[3:32:29] <penitentpendant> He's not movin'
[3:32:30] <peyodogo> @peyodogo i don't know dude, i know that za/um announced a collaboration with some tv people to make a show. saw it on the game's tvtropes page description

[3:33:21] <%Blackleafx> @user_naim I think Rob Yang is a pretty popular "fan casting"
[3:33:22] <%Jeshk0> @user_naim i automatically think of the japanese cop from Man in the High Castle
[3:33:24] <leinadtonu> Damn, this game...
[3:33:30] <Alfred_Waaghur> There's a small church there. It used to be bigger.

[3:35:18] <Visorak6> This is not going to be fun
[3:35:22] <%Piemono> yup
[3:35:25] <user_naim> God this coast gets fucking sad
[3:35:26] <%Ranryu692> This is my favorite quest from what ive played so far
[3:35:27] <Daxalog> Whos this guy? I forget.
[3:35:27] <%jorniev> that art box is incredible and haunting
[3:35:30] <%MidnightBurst12> damn
[3:35:31] <+emperri> of all sad words of tongue and pen, the saddest are these: inland empire was right again
[3:35:33] <%Kataguro> At least it was quick I guess...
[3:35:35] <leinadtonu> We were promised hijinks...
[3:35:36] <Tisaric> It was just a fucking unstable board too
[3:35:41] <Tisaric> it's so fucking depressing
[3:35:50] <aiutare47> WACKY WAHOO GAME
[3:35:57] <+GingerStrawhat> Oh people just you wait
[3:36:00] <+Celarious> Literally just a bad turn of luck
[3:36:02] <Daxalog> Oh is the husband?
[3:36:10] <peyodogo> @Daxalog remember the woman you meet that asks you to find her husband after you insist he's missing? who says that she-- yeah
[3:36:10] <+JobbedBone> BibleThump
[3:36:11] <ingman112> This game is both so funny and so, so sad
[3:36:12] <peyodogo> yeah
[3:36:16] <oda_flobunaga> OOOOOOOOOOOOFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFF
[3:36:17] <aiutare47> To think this starts with arguing with ties and flipping double birds
[3:36:24] <yourliteraldog> Sometimes it freaks out how easy it is to die.
[3:36:25] <Daxalog> oh!
[3:36:27] <%Broken_Sonex> Literally just bad luck.
[3:36:27] <%Arweynn> Is this wheelchair lady husband?
[3:36:31] <cumurasame> @ingman112 like life

[3:37:32] <ingman112> @jorniev In fairness I think Pat might know at this point
[3:37:34] <%Cykron> Wow in good taste
[3:37:36] <DSD24> Specific dialogue for wearing thsoe boots
[3:37:39] <LtThunderbolt> lol
[3:37:42] <ingman112> @jorniev But you're right, still better to be safe
[3:37:56] <%jorniev> @ingman112 ok then
[3:38:02] <aiutare47> @bugz_munny He was unconscious but yeah
[3:38:06] <@SoFarFetched> why do I suddenly tab in here and see boobie fallout guy geefBruh
[3:38:09] <derap41> Doesn't work it comes from the throat
[3:38:12] <@SoFarFetched> fall guys*
[3:38:15] <aiutare47> god thats somehow worse
[3:38:19] <derap41> from the lungs
[3:38:27] <%Nordguy> man
[3:38:31] <%jorniev> the art of the man reminds me of Goya
[3:38:37] <DSD24> There we go
[3:38:40] <LordOfThePoultry> FeelsBadMan
[3:38:48] <+ALazo> It happens sometimes. Sometimes its hydra dicks, sometimes it's flapping fall guy boobies
[3:38:49] <%Broken_Sonex> @SoFarFetched It was impressive, for what it was
[3:38:50] <%Kataguro> Fucking oof
[3:38:51] <cardamomo88> can we lie and see we don't find him
[3:38:54] <+bugz_munny> shit
[3:38:55] <ingman112> JEsus conceptualization
[3:38:58] <%JusTTheGuyYouNeed> You hassled his wife on the day he died, awesome
[3:39:01] <leinadtonu> it is
[3:39:04] <%Jeshk0> fuck

[3:39:13] <%Broken_Sonex> @ALazo And some times it's Among Us
[3:39:14] <+GingerStrawhat> 4
[3:39:18] <The48thCrow> bruh
[3:39:19] <derap41> but the kebab tho
[3:39:25] <dd44dostivei> rich people don't just fall down and die
[3:39:28] <hippofant> @JusTTheGuyYouNeed If it makes you feel better, he died a few days ago I think!
[3:39:34] <%muXPerience> Marriage is actually very rare in revachol
[3:39:37] <+Mrbaconator> the lady cap22Sadge
[3:39:51] <derap41> just needed someone to  die first like usual
[3:40:01] <+JobbedBone> in mine, I hadn't met the lady when I found this
[3:40:02] <+wizard_of_diamonds> Damn, Kim spittin' fire
[3:40:06] <vilecrois> Just a reminder that this game goes "haha, alcohol and drugs" half of the time and then hits you with a reality check
[3:40:06] <%JusTTheGuyYouNeed> @hippofant Nope, the game says he died on day 2, the day the working wife shows up
[3:40:10] <derap41> He said the thing
[3:40:17] <cardamomo88> that's a fuck way to go
[3:40:23] <user_naim> @derap41 for them to just ignore it even then.
[3:40:29] <SolSwagGuy56> Half Light pls
[3:40:31] <%muXPerience> shut up half light
[3:40:32] <%GarbageNirvana> FEEEAR
[3:40:33] <penitentpendant> 2 is logical
[3:40:34] <%Kataguro> That's stupid, Half Light
[3:40:37] <hippofant> On that day, she says he hasn't been home for a few days I think.
[3:40:39] <user_naim> just like these often go
[3:40:47] <SolSwagGuy56> INLAND
[3:40:48] <LordOfThePoultry> don't listen to half light
[3:40:50] <Ids560> oh yeah look at this paid actor
[3:40:51] <vilecrois> The sequence killer is AL GUL
[3:40:53] <derap41> Inland stfu
[3:40:54] <akitanito> go away inland
[3:40:54] <%Kataguro> Your dumber stats are really being idiots
[3:40:55] <%ClericOfSparda> LUL
[3:40:56] <derap41> you crazy
[3:41:01] <Estwilde> it might be a sexy accident
[3:41:01] <+Jiggisnipe> lol the stats
[3:41:02] <+JobbedBone> when halflight haywires its literally just fear
[3:41:04] <TrophicFault> we're onto something
[3:41:04] <%ClericOfSparda> That's kind of a stretch, Harry
[3:41:10] <%illusiveSaint> borderline paranoid LUL
[3:41:11] <user_naim> alright inland, calm down
[3:41:11] <+RushUnplugged> @vilecrois it really is
[3:41:14] <%emperordread> the hanging was staged, this might be too?
[3:41:16] <%neroforte177> no you're actually crazy
[3:41:21] <cumurasame> stop listening to half light, he's a tool
[3:41:31] <derap41> You intuition is fucked man
[3:41:37] <PepperJam_Art> The fact that he was alone at the pier staring of into the ocean, just before coming home... you can hear him telling himself it was the last time... NotLikeThis
[3:41:58] <akitanito> are you trying to collect the bottles
[3:41:58] <MegalomaniacalMegalodon> 2 cases a week, right Harry?
[3:41:58] <%muXPerience> half light works well in a half-light playthrough but if the stat is low, you only hear from him when he's spooked
[3:42:17] <%cobalt_phoenix_> @PepperJam_Art why you do this to me
[3:42:20] <SolSwagGuy56> uh oh
[3:42:23] <+JobbedBone> he was hiding his breath BibleThump he wanted to go home
[3:42:27] <derap41> even high halflight can go off whilly nilly
[3:42:33] <cumurasame> if you go full physical do you get more "PUNCH THIS PROBLEM" options after hidden checks...?
[3:42:37] <aiutare47> not how that name is said
[3:42:39] <%jorniev> @JobbedBone DAMN
[3:42:40] <aiutare47> Teebo
[3:42:43] <%Kataguro> He's doing his best
[3:42:51] <+Mrbaconator> he's doin his best
[3:42:53] <+Mrbaconator> 😠
[3:43:00] <penitentpendant> Just early enough to call
[3:43:05] <derap41> @cumurasame a bit but its really physical is pretty boring just limits you
[3:43:05] <hippofant> Isn't the narrator Algerian?
[3:43:09] <ingman112> It's hard to begrudge the narrator his quirks, given the absolute MOUNTAIN of dialogue he had to get through
[3:43:10] <Visorak6> You can get there quick
[3:43:12] <+titansloth93> The VA's throat must've been so sore after all this lmao
[3:43:13] <aiutare47> @PatStaresAt have you read the interview with the narrator yet?
[3:43:17] <cumurasame> btw this is the Narrator/Voices FIRST voice acting gig
[3:43:23] <+emperri> The VA is good but there's so much french in this game that it's a weird choice
[3:43:30] <saraizarai> Imagine having to VA this
[3:43:36] <%Jeshk0> Billie Majean? He's not my lover!
[3:43:41] <user_naim> Still God tier narrator though
[3:43:42] <PepperJam_Art> @cumurasame oh jesus
[3:43:43] <notsoy> use the things that heal health but hurt morale, you have all those meds
[3:43:47] <%jorniev> how many voice line was it?
[3:43:48] <+Mrbaconator> holy shit is this really the first voice acting job the dude has done?
[3:43:57] <godzookylives> @PatStaresAt Chris is in KOF 15
[3:44:01] <aiutare47> Narrator did an interview with PC Gamer, go read it. Its great.
[3:44:02] <NeroInfinite> No
[3:44:04] <%The_Gaming_Karp> You cannot fast-travel while enemies are nearby.
[3:44:07] <notsoy> yeah, he's a musician/singer
[3:44:09] <leinadtonu> you can fast travel?
[3:44:10] <Chatterbox1991> @PatStaresAt  check west of the Feld Labratory first
[3:44:12] <Tisaric> yeah apparently the main narrator guy is completely fresh to VA
[3:44:12] <ingman112> Might be a bug
[3:44:13] <Nohorse> Isn't the travel from the village?
[3:44:13] <+emperri> LUL
[3:44:14] <peyodogo> its a weird choice but imagine finding someone that can pull off this much text with this much quality (aside from the french)
[3:44:15] <%walternatorz> the game is weird with fast travel
[3:44:16] <derap41> This guy should read The Raven
[3:44:17] <DeepSearch27> uh oh
[3:44:18] <LeotheHuntsman> magic pixel
[3:44:18] <user_naim> @the_gaming_karp lol
[3:44:19] <chippybippers> fast travel is buggy
[3:44:22] <+GingerStrawhat> Fast Travel in this game is kind of a mess
[3:44:23] <+MrAtheGreat> in front of the church door
[3:44:26] <artificiallynatural> the positioning is really specific
[3:44:30] <bettysharkface> There's stuff you need to trigger I think
[3:44:31] <LunarRemix> The fast travel in this game is super inconsistent
[3:44:32] <ingman112> Just head for the village
[3:44:33] <cumurasame> oh right, Fast Travel is known to get buggy as the days increase
[3:44:34] <aiutare47> He was an amateur who needed the cash
[3:44:35] <+kewlmyc> THERE'S FAST TRAVEL?
[3:44:35] <+MrAtheGreat> huh
[3:44:38] <+MrAtheGreat> weird
[3:44:39] <SilverFeng> fast travel is jank
[3:44:42] <vilecrois> Better go to the fishing hamlet then
[3:44:43] <+MrAtheGreat> It worked for me
[3:44:46] <Visorak6> It gets buggy
[3:44:47] <LunarRemix> It is actually a badly implemented system
[3:44:49] <Nohorse> Maybe try from the village?
[3:44:49] <%Kataguro> I never used Fast Travel for this reason
[3:44:49] <+emperri> @kewlmyc Added in the final cut
[3:44:51] <Ids560> reload maybe?
[3:44:53] <+MrAtheGreat> maybe you need to have gone into the chiurch first
[3:44:53] <PepperJam_Art> I thought you had to be in the shack
[3:44:54] <DeepSearch27> Just walk for a bit and then FT
[3:44:55] <+JobbedBone> fast travel was jerry rigged in and it shows
[3:44:56] <penitentpendant> Huh, I wonder if you have to open the church door first. I've never bothered before that.
[3:44:57] <%emperordread> @kewlmyc You have to buy the map in the bookstore for it to work
[3:45:00] <%illusiveSaint> narrator VA should do philosophy audiobooks I'll listen lol
[3:45:04] <digaogrunge> Its bugged
[3:45:04] <leinadtonu> I finished the game and never once heard of fast travel...
[3:45:06] <+RoByte2> Fast travel just straight up stopped working for me on day 4
[3:45:15] <TrophicFault> bless you
[3:45:15] <+GingerStrawhat> I never used it, it was always jut a pain in the ass to use
[3:45:18] <+GlewmanIII> watch it not be the same
[3:45:20] <+emperri> @leinadtonu It was added in the most recent update
[3:45:22] <Press_X_ToJASON> @leinadtonu was added with the final cut i think
[3:45:23] <PepperJam_Art> game's pretty buggy in general, it just doesn't really break
[3:45:24] <aiutare47> Talk to the washerwoman
[3:45:29] <%ClericOfSparda> Narrator is a musician who kinda stumbled into this gig
[3:45:31] <+MrAtheGreat> I don't like the fast travel in this game it's wayyyyy to finnicky
[3:45:33] <ingman112> Yeah see now it's being weird
[3:45:34] <Tisaric> it seems like it's just buggy as shit yeah
[3:45:37] <Nohorse> Could quitting and restarting fix it?
[3:45:39] <+emperri> Wash that fucking jacket
[3:45:39] <bettysharkface> Oh yeah, the washerwoman
[3:45:41] <digaogrunge> talk to old lady
[3:45:43] <derap41> Babushka
[3:45:45] <+kewlmyc> @kewlmyc I have the map and never knew this. Holy shit.
[3:45:46] <LunarRemix> Yeah it's a bug. Sometimes it won't work even after restarting the game
[3:45:51] <illusiveSaint> don't rely on fast travel it sucks
[3:45:54] <+MrAtheGreat> @PatStaresAt Well at least you didn't get the bug that deletes what you're currently wearing from the game
[3:45:56] <+Riecharus> Yeah it just stopped working at some point in my playthrough and never worked again.
[3:45:57] <+Jiggisnipe> only half an hour?
[3:46:00] <cardamomo88> is fine i can wait
[3:46:01] <%AzureGale> LUL
[3:46:02] <+Jiggisnipe> wow she's good
[3:46:03] <+JobbedBone> sad part is that it really wasn't that buggy of a game before the new update, at least from my experience
[3:46:03] <SolSwagGuy56> Phys pls
[3:46:03] <Visorak6> COACH
[3:46:04] <penitentpendant> @kewlmyc TBF, as you can see, it's buggy af

[3:47:14] <+icekept> awesome
[3:47:16] <bettysharkface> YEAH

[3:47:23] <DianaTheAscian> 6 hr stream lets go
[3:47:23] <user_naim> Dripsco Elysium
[3:47:25] <%VyperVic> i'm glad we got the phone call
[3:47:25] <%rumtumtugnutz> Small time of POOPING
[3:47:29] <+bugz_munny> "Im gonna solve it..."
[3:47:31] <peyodogo> time to grab snacks and hydrate and cry, chat
[3:47:36] <%thedankestmeeme> 24hr stream
[3:47:40] <%thedankestmeeme> lets goooo
[3:47:46] <%rumtumtugnutz> SISQO ELYSIUM
[3:47:50] <%cobalt_phoenix_> did he talk to the music guys?
[3:47:50] <Alfred_Waaghur> He will solve it. For Elysium.
[3:47:50] <%thedankestmeeme> 24 hour stream poggers
[3:47:59] <ItsPastas> I'm really looking forward to both Pat meeting The Pigs and the karaoke scene
[3:47:59] <leinadtonu> hydrate to cry is my middle name
[3:48:00] <+mental_mashup> i just realized the twitch integration thing on the left wasnt just in game ui LUL
[3:48:07] <%VyperVic> i'd say there's 4-6 hr to go before the end
[3:48:11] <Alfred_Waaghur> Not yet, he's yet to get into the whole church thing.
[3:48:13] <derap41> Woolie has to catch up hard before he and Pat can fully talk about this game
[3:48:14] <ingman112> @cobalt_phoenix_ Not yet
[3:48:22] <%cobalt_phoenix_> ok
[3:48:25] <%VyperVic> but I am bad with time
[3:48:27] <Blank9> no way, there's a lot more game
[3:48:29] <peyodogo> its gonna be a bit
[3:48:34] <+bugz_munny> depends on how much side stuff pat does
[3:48:40] <ingman112> @derap41 My greatest fear is that woolie will have something amazing spoiled for him by Pat
[3:48:41] <derap41> @VyperVic could be quite a bit more depending on how diligent Pat is
[3:48:43] <+bugz_munny> theres definitely a point of no return
[3:48:48] <%thedankestmeeme> its gonna be like 24 hours bit
[3:48:50] <%admiral_of_crunch> All the side stuff, I assume.
[3:48:50] <user_naim> Maybe now I may sin, and let out a single ”TO THE MEGA”
[3:48:53] <%Piemen99> God that phone scene fucked me up right good
[3:49:05] <ItsPastas> Pat hasn't done any of the Church side quests right? Those can take a lot of time
[3:49:06] <%athuramn> I'm afraid for his handeye coordination
[3:49:10] <Blank9> the phone scene gets sooooo much worse if you call back like an idiot
[3:49:10] <Alfred_Waaghur> I've played the game through twice, but watching Pat's stream is honestly more fun.
[3:49:11] <derap41> @ingman112 Yeah that's my worry too
[3:49:19] <%admiral_of_crunch> There's still a whole back quarter-to-fifth of the game left.
[3:49:20] <PepperJam_Art> @itspastas nothing yet
[3:49:24] <%VyperVic> hey, lads. will we warn pat before the story red checks to let him prepare his gear?
[3:49:34] <+emperri> There's several hours left. Even the "point of no return" is a few hours from the end
[3:49:36] <%Jeshk0> this game really perfects the emotional RKO outta nowhere
[3:49:40] <%thedankestmeeme> RELOAD!!!
[3:49:41] <ingman112> @VyperVic You mean the no return?
[3:49:43] <Blank9> it'll tell him enough
[3:49:50] <%athuramn> it's quite obvious when it happens, no?
[3:49:58] <ingman112> @VyperVic I think that's okay, plus the game will warn him as well. We can just mention it when it comes up
[3:50:00] <+JobbedBone> no spoilers, game telegraphs PLENTY
[3:50:02] <ItsPastas> The game is very explicit when it comes to that
[3:50:03] <%admiral_of_crunch> The game tips you off to the biggest most important shit.
[3:50:05] <Tisaric> there's still a lot to get through
[3:50:06] <+bugz_munny> yeah the whole ending sequence can take like 3+ hours
[3:50:07] <peyodogo> theres plenty of chance to [redacted] yet, not too worried
[3:50:09] <user_naim> The game warns you right? And Pat does save often
[3:50:12] <+emperri> @VyperVic I don't think he's so bad that he could get the worst outcome so I would say not. only difference is hardies flavor text
[3:50:17] <%athuramn> I mean, he was paranoid af about shoving a bottle up his butt so I don't think we need to worry @VyperVic
[3:50:23] <Tisaric> and yeah the game is very nice about warning you
[3:50:26] <%thedankestmeeme> RELOAD
[3:50:34] <%VyperVic> there are story important red checks that he will want to pass, I'm talking about telling him what stats to have geared up
[3:50:35] <Blank9> the only thing pat should know is when to put his tie on if he takes it off so he doesn't miss dialogue
[3:50:35] <+bugz_munny> It kiiiiinda warns you
[3:50:35] <The48thCrow> I hope he does the crypto storyline
[3:50:38] <PepperJam_Art> Oh replaying this game is mindbreaking
[3:50:42] <+bugz_munny> only for big things though
[3:50:44] <+JobbedBone> nobody gives pat enough credit, let him bumble a bit like you're supposed to
[3:50:45] <Blank9> but that's fixed by just keeping it on while walking around
[3:50:48] <%thedankestmeeme> catJAM
[3:50:48] <peyodogo> i still cant believe there was no butt chug
[3:50:55] <ingman112> @Blank9 Yeah and he hasn't removed it yet
[3:50:59] <+Jiggisnipe> @ingman112 Woolie tries to avoid internalizing things that Pat can spoil for him. He was completely surprised by the FF14 raid even tho Pat talked alot about it two or so weeks ago
[3:51:17] <+emperri> @VyperVic He has the spirit bomb and he's getting the gun. He's fine enough, he doesn't need to be 100% perfect
[3:51:35] <PepperJam_Art> For example, when you first touch Kim's car the game keeps talking about the sea and how bad you feel
[3:51:36] <%admiral_of_crunch> We shouldn't tell Pat which stat he needs for the big one. If he fails that naturally it'll be legendary.
[3:51:46] <leinadtonu> Some things cannot be avoided
[3:51:47] <%admiral_of_crunch> Let him fuck up the game on his own
[3:51:48] <%athuramn> eh, the way his stat distribution is, unless he has us juice things for him constantly during that bit, he's gonna fail things that would just be par for course
[3:51:57] <%thedankestmeeme> RELOAD!
[3:51:57] <%admiral_of_crunch> I certainly didn't know what was coming.
[3:52:01] <Blank9> yeah any stats work he'll be fine
[3:52:07] <Tisaric> oh I just realized why the fast travel gets fucky after day 4
[3:52:07] <%thedankestmeeme> oh too early
[3:52:16] <peyodogo> yeah, however it goes is how itll go and its going to be sick either way
[3:52:18] <ingman112> Yeah there's a difference between saying "hey might be some cool shit over this way" and "Here is what this cool shit explicitly is and how exactly to get it"
[3:52:37] <%VyperVic> alright, no early warnings then. if he fails it he fails it.
[3:52:49] <%chiluzza> chiluzza subscribed at Tier 1. They've subscribed for 37 months, currently on a 15 month streak! bring me enjoyment as i suffer through my steady raid group regresses on everything
[3:52:52] <PepperJam_Art> @peyodogo ikr, this game is sick
[3:52:53] <%thedankestmeeme> LETS GO!
[3:52:53] <%admiral_of_crunch> If you're in doubt, don't tell him shit.
[3:53:07] <Blank9> if he really hates anything he can always savescum anyway
[3:53:08] <%admiral_of_crunch> If Pat REALLY wants to, he'll reload.
[3:53:15] <+CursedNobleman> rELOAD!
[3:53:15] <peyodogo> yeah, please dont give hints lmao
[3:53:19] <%thedankestmeeme> Reload!
[3:53:31] <+emperri> The only thing I can see him really needing a tip for is that I can totally see him blowing by the bed at the end
[3:53:33] <%Jeshk0> should we get pat save scum the kareoke?
[3:53:34] <%AzureGale> If pat REALLY wants to, he'll go
[3:53:36] <+dante_must_die_exe> giving patstar hints LUL
[3:53:37] <%athuramn> yeah, I think he'll save scum that choice if he doesn't like it, it has too much impact
[3:53:40] <+bugz_munny> There's one specific line he just has to never ever cross any he's good to do all the side quests
[3:53:47] <+bugz_munny> but he is very close to that line
[3:53:49] <%Jeshk0> to see both versions
[3:53:58] <+mczarklesby> He's going to replay on his own. Let this go how it goes.
[3:53:59] <%ChrisPlaysThing> ChrisPlaysThing subscribed at Tier 1. They've subscribed for 31 months, currently on a 24 month streak! Aww yeah, jank jonk it up! Keep on keeping on Pat I'm up to 24k from my initial 8k. Investing is fun.

[3:54:56] <%Kataguro> Get a composure point for Annette
[3:55:01] <derap41> you could drink and the level a stat up
[3:55:03] <%admiral_of_crunch> The Kuroko's Basket Zone? That's a good zone to be in.
[3:55:07] <faithless_zealot> Shivers, yo
[3:55:09] <pi_in_the_sci> pain threshold acts like physical armor
[3:55:10] <%VyperVic> comp for anette
[3:55:10] <+JobbedBone> I juice stuff I'm already good at. no point in rounding out
[3:55:11] <%SirGO0SE> man this guys in the fucking zone
[3:55:14] <user_naim> more Perception, see all!
[3:55:16] <%athuramn> let's be real guys, he only likes this game because of the re style inventory management
[3:55:17] <%Gloom_Tangerine> @patstaresat what new thoughts do you have?
[3:55:19] <+emperri> LUL
[3:55:19] <%ChrisPlaysThing> CAN'T
[3:55:20] <ingman112> Lol yeah put all 3 into Shivers
[3:55:21] <faithless_zealot> Oh, you can't =(
[3:55:22] <akitanito> you can't
[3:55:22] <$metzselaar> Reaction speed might be a good idea
[3:55:25] <faithless_zealot> My bad
[3:55:26] <%Jeshk0> any thoughts you want to change?
[3:55:26] <Blank9> oops
[3:55:26] <user_naim> Let your eyes pierce brick walls
[3:55:28] <penitentpendant> Look how high it got!
[3:55:33] <sirtommygunn> oh noo
[3:55:34] <penitentpendant> Onward!
[3:55:35] <derap41> Drink then level think that works
[3:55:35] <%dalmek> Composure for Annette and the smoker dude?
[3:55:36] <+RushUnplugged> Composure is real good, so is reaction
[3:55:36] <NeroInfinite> LUL
[3:55:38] <Blank9> there IS  protip move drug users can do
[3:55:39] <PepperJam_Art> That's what you get for not being a hobo
[3:55:40] <%athuramn> holy shit his perception
[3:55:40] <+JobbedBone> alcohol would let you level it pat :)
[3:55:46] <%ChrisPlaysThing> Physical Instrument, punch measurehead out Kappa
[3:55:49] <%hax_metatron> Save a few points for Thought Cabinet
[3:55:54] <Blank9> raise their stats with drugs, then level up with their new caps that they keep even after the drugs wear off
[3:55:54] <ingman112> But then you gotta drink
[3:56:01] <%VyperVic> did you report your badge found
[3:56:02] <oda_flobunaga> Pat will not imbibe this run
[3:56:03] <Psyramics> no thoughts, head empty
[3:56:03] <Blank9> I played sober though
[3:56:05] <+emperri> Didn't pat do the thought that makes alcohol not work
[3:56:11] <%hax_metatron> It also costs to forget / unlock new skill slots
[3:56:13] <+JobbedBone> hes sobering
[3:56:17] <ingman112> @emperri Not yet
[3:56:18] <$metzselaar> No drugs, no boose folks
[3:56:20] <%hax_metatron> For later
[3:56:21] <oda_flobunaga> aquire thots
[3:56:21] <%AzureGale> Teetotaler run
[3:56:22] <NeroInfinite> @ChrisPlaysThing HE already did that..like two-three strams ago
[3:56:24] <%bread_assassin> Technically, you "could" buy and drink alcohol to raise your Phys and THEN put a skill point into Shivers.
[3:56:26] <+purps26> buy books?
[3:56:28] <cardamomo88> one hour until karaoke
[3:56:29] <ingman112> @emperri He hasn't encountered it yet. So again, easy
[3:56:31] <+GingerStrawhat> I mean your pretty much in there pat like 3/4 through the game
[3:56:33] <+bugz_munny> man i forgot we had to do this
[3:56:33] <+mczarklesby> This isn't a leading question, I genuinely don't know. What time do prime karaoke hours start?
[3:56:34] <%ChrisPlaysThing> Does Perception 10 just see the answer before logically possible?
[3:56:45] <%admiral_of_crunch> Oh my god you can boost your caps with drugs? Drug run here we go baybee
[3:56:49] <ingman112> @mczarklesby I believe 18:00?
[3:56:50] <akitanito> "belt"
[3:56:50] <%AzureGale> Metal belt
[3:56:50] <Blank9> it just notices details
[3:56:55] <%athuramn> @emperri your word choice could be a lot better mate
[3:56:59] <+mczarklesby> @ingman112 ty
[3:57:22] <+BusterRepukken> KOF 15 Chris looks fun as hell
[3:57:26] <%DakotaMacDoodle> DakotaMacDoodle subscribed at Tier 1. They've subscribed for 22 months, currently on a 10 month streak! Just got off work, Glad I didn't miss this part.
[3:57:31] <%Jeshk0> Billie Majean? He's not my lover!
[3:58:10] <%bread_assassin> @admiral_of_crunch Yeah, but you gotta put a skill point into a stat to "lock" in it. The drug wearing off will not take away that skill point.
[3:58:20] <%admiral_of_crunch> I love this voiced conversation.
[3:58:23] <derap41> Shivers god damn cool it
[3:58:25] <%athuramn> thanks shivers (Y)
[3:58:26] <Blank9> you get plenty of shivers even with 4
[3:58:33] <+kewlmyc> Shivers is just psychic
[3:58:42] <+JobbedBone> that one line about only seeing people on the worst day of their lives, for years on end...
[3:58:56] <derap41> Shiver just invents narratives
[3:58:57] <Alfred_Waaghur> This game is Oranjese lit.
[3:59:00] <%Kataguro> The apartments themselves
[3:59:05] <%Ranryu692> same building, not same apartment
[3:59:06] <%GarbageNirvana> Not that EXACT apartment
[3:59:06] <%hax_metatron> The apartments
[3:59:06] <+bugz_munny> same complex
[3:59:07] <%ClericOfSparda> Yuuuup
[3:59:08] <cardamomo88> ???
[3:59:08] <+emperri> @athuramn Dunno what you mean, the thought about going sober means you don't get positive effects from drinking alcohol
[3:59:08] <LunarRemix> It's in that area is what it's saying
[3:59:09] <%Ranryu692> though they're close
[3:59:09] <ingman112> Same building, not same apartment
[3:59:09] <user_naim> same building
[3:59:09] <+JustToWatch> Same building
[3:59:10] <+zinris> same building
[3:59:10] <+bugz_munny> not same apartment
[3:59:10] <NeroInfinite> oh no
[3:59:11] <Visorak6> Same balcony
[3:59:12] <%Kataguro> THAT would be a fucking twist
[3:59:12] <%Mucmaster> Neighbours
[3:59:12] <+GingerStrawhat> It means like next to the smoker
[3:59:13] <+Celarious> Same building not same apartment
[3:59:14] <+Jiggisnipe> lol
[3:59:14] <%Jeshk0> next door

[3:59:51] <ingman112> Christ
[3:59:53] <%Kataguro> Ah yes, Cyberpunk
[4:00:00] <cardamomo88> BIG OOF
[4:00:04] <%athuramn> just saying you don't need to reveal the content of the thought, that's part of the waiting. he can wiki your info if he wanted to

[4:02:16] <%athuramn> and if we don't know, then you can ask in more vague terms, or just wait. Or highlight your message, why do I care lmao @emperri

[4:02:23] <%Jeshk0> "Something Beautiful Is Coming" yeah fcuking right
[4:02:26] <+Celarious> You need another webcam so we can have constant Gief cam
[4:02:27] <aiutare47> @Blank9 Just like life, if you want to wax poetic.
[4:02:28] <Tisaric> the 1-2 punch of getting your gun back into a sad song to end would be perfect
[4:02:30] <Blank9> like this alternates harder than yakuza sidequests vs main quests
[4:02:38] <%OfficioPrefectusCorgi> Sound just went off
[4:02:38] <PepperJam_Art> The game is trying to depress Pat now that he express his excitement
[4:02:41] <%jorniev> this is the depresing episode
[4:02:43] <%AzureGale> Watch Gief accidentally close the game or something like that
[4:02:46] <+Jiggisnipe> @Blank9 makes the sad stuff sadder when goofy stuff also happens
[4:02:46] <%Monkeyweed21> psaBlep psaWink psaDab psaGiefrail psaDogchamp

[4:12:24] <dewy_516> starting the stream on a black screen love it!!
[4:12:26] <user_naim> And we were having fun earlier, bugging her
[4:12:26] <tanarath> Can you save him?
[4:12:27] <causewaybob> Big sad
[4:12:33] <dewy_516> I have no idea what's coming!
[4:12:34] <aiutare47> very accurate
[4:12:36] <moonmeh> god that response
[4:12:37] <BerryliciousDefinition> Oh this is heartbreaking
[4:12:39] <tanarath> If you go by earlier.
[4:12:45] <hippofant> @tanarath no
[4:12:46] <+kewlmyc> Rough, but yeah, they have to manage on their own
[4:12:49] <akitanito> no
[4:12:49] <%Mathochism> @tanarath Nope.
[4:12:50] <%athuramn> @tanarath I don't believe so. bridge isn't crossable
[4:12:52] <PartyFavors> @tanarath No. He's always been dead for two days.
[4:12:57] <tanarath> Christ.
[4:12:58] <marcomatame> @OswaldTheDog I wish I was a more emotional person, tearing up by experiencing art sounds cool.
[4:13:02] <sirtommygunn> Looks like it's about to pour this sadness... into SONG
[4:13:04] <+CloudsBringRain> no saving him
[4:13:04] <DianaTheAscian> I'm gonna guess you can check on her in the future
[4:13:05] <derap41> God dammit Shivers
[4:13:07] <%bread_assassin> @tanarath He dies before you have access to the southern part of the map.
[4:13:09] <penitentpendant> How do I put this... This is 'just' a sidequest, but it's a very powerful one. Kudos to the writing.
[4:13:09] <%emperordread> Can we please do karaoke now :(
[4:13:11] <HeroToxiko> he was missing afterall
[4:13:11] <spooksy> hmmm
[4:13:11] <cardamomo88> so who wants some karaoke... i guess
[4:13:13] <ingman112> Not urgent, but at some point
[4:13:14] <cumurasame> @tanarath I don't think so? Considering the time line, he should be dead on Day1, and the bridge is broken on that day
[4:13:16] <%garbageheaphound> hey Pat did you get the map?
[4:13:18] <akitanito> naaaahh
[4:13:18] <%illusiveSaint> did pat talk to dude near that bldg?

[4:13:20] <%walternatorz> I always get shivers when shivers talks.
[4:13:23] <moonmeh> its such a real sidequest

[4:25:55] <+charp35> Well they didn't censor that one
[4:25:55] <+fugatlas> that shoulda been morale damage lol
[4:25:55] <+Jiggisnipe> BOOMER
[4:25:57] <OswaldTheDog> WHOOPS
[4:25:57] <BerryliciousDefinition> LUL
[4:25:59] <%thelaxinator> wow, they actually said it under the bleep? Why would they do that?
[4:26:00] <+AWKWARDL0SER> That’s got by the goalie
[4:26:01] <derap41> I used to be with it!
[4:26:02] <+OneGorillionDollars> 2
[4:26:02] <sirtommygunn> Reaction Speed was too fast for the censors
[4:26:02] <+MrAtheGreat> LUL BOOMER
[4:26:05] <user_naim> but the piss part adds useful context
[4:26:08] <nakpack> Dudes rock
[4:26:09] <cumurasame> Uh oh. DEVS THAT WASN'T CENSOREDDDD
[4:26:09] <fritz_dacat> old man cops
[4:26:09] <Devbob98> You mummy
[4:26:11] <%The_Gaming_Karp> It's not Harry, it's the kids who are out of touch
[4:26:12] <MegalomaniacalMegalodon> Boomerism intensifies, Disco babe
[4:26:14] <cardamomo88> BIG BOOMER
[4:26:15] <dd44dostivei> I WILL ALSO POINT OUT THAT THEY MISSED A CENSOR
[4:26:17] <+MrAtheGreat> Shoulda talked about contact mike
[4:26:19] <aiutare47> @MegalomaniacalMegalodon Exactly. The internal tube magaizne of a Winchester Model 1897 holds 5 2 3/4 shells and Vatican City is .43 kilometers squared but I dont know my boyfriends birthday
[4:26:19] <%Garthunox> THAT ONE GOT THROUGH
[4:26:21] <dewy_516> don't tell a child you grind guys unless you're a skate park
[4:26:24] <%hax_metatron> Pat heal you're hoarding points!
[4:26:50] <derap41> Shouldn't top off Pat
[4:26:51] <sirtommygunn> If only Pat had slurs set to off
[4:27:03] <peyodogo> that is actually very cool
[4:27:07] <%hax_metatron> Why not top off?
[4:27:08] <TrophicFault> set slurs to max
[4:27:11] <+Celarious> Local man calls himself a boomer and has a breakdown infront of poor child
[4:27:15] <%hax_metatron> Doesn't that improve checks?  Am I missing something?
[4:27:16] <derap41> wastes free moral health
[4:27:17] <cumurasame> btw just so you guys know, your Physical and Emotional stats are actually LOWER when you have damage
[4:27:28] <+JobbedBone> @cumurasame everything about the portrayal treats the voices as the way the harry thinks, not as foreign intrusive agencies
[4:27:32] <%Deft_Thought> Aww man
[4:27:33] <MegalomaniacalMegalodon> @MegalomaniacalMegalodon I've caused managers to laugh so hard walking into the office at the end of a shift with someone talking about origins of comic book characters or some random candy brand
[4:27:42] <%GarbageNirvana> If only more people were sorry about the fuck
[4:27:44] <%Ranryu692> I gave her the hobo hat
[4:27:44] <derap41> @cumurasame no wonder I fucked up so many
[4:27:45] <%bevyrage> if you put on a hat then talk to her you can give her the hat you're wearing
[4:27:47] <%illusiveSaint> give her the bum hat lol
[4:27:49] <ingman112> @cumurasame You're right but only Endurance and Volition; the rest are unaffected
[4:27:54] <%jorniev> empathy is pretty good ... when it doesnt talk about the cock carousel
[4:27:56] <dmtjinni> yeyeyeye
[4:27:58] <OswaldTheDog> this girl is trying to make sunn O))
[4:28:00] <%hax_metatron> Doing these kids right is the best thing I did in the game No Doubt. The outcome of this is PURE VICTORY in my eyes
[4:28:02] <%The_Gaming_Karp> Vatican is actually .49 km sq.
[4:28:16] <ingman112> @hax_metatron Shh
[4:28:17] <cardamomo88> oh this is
[4:28:17] <%GarbageNirvana> I ended up giving her my Dick Mullen hat, which my encyclopedia was already pretty jacked up so
[4:28:21] <oda_flobunaga> oof
[4:28:22] <DianaTheAscian> ummm
[4:28:23] <aiutare47> @MegalomaniacalMegalodon its a bizarre curse we carry my man. Useful at times, but mostly annoying. No room for anything but trivia.
[4:28:23] <%Cykron> Go kick their asses Harry
[4:28:33] <akitanito> oh wow
[4:28:34] <cardamomo88> buff dont fail
[4:28:34] <cumurasame> @JobbedBone Could it be DID? Or just some variation of mental illness? I don't think it's that fair to blame him, especially since that conflict with each other constantly
[4:28:35] <%Kataguro> Based Contact Mike
[4:28:47] <%jorniev> wow contact mike helped
[4:28:50] <aiutare47> @The_Gaming_Karp I shall re-internalize the size of the Vatican
[4:28:55] <%GarbageNirvana> A church converted to a club would be kinda dope
[4:28:56] <derap41> Early techno
[4:29:16] <cumurasame> @GarbageNirvana It'd be pretty... HARDCORE
[4:29:24] <%The_Gaming_Karp> @The_Gaming_Karp It was just so specific a number I had to seek confirmation XD
[4:29:27] <%illusiveSaint> kanye west Sunday service but hardcore
[4:29:33] <leinadtonu> Ultra hardcore even
[4:29:37] <DeepSearch27> We are *The Law*
[4:29:39] <%Monkeyweed21> YEA
[4:29:47] <+fugatlas> isnt a church converted into a club one of the levels in WatchDogs
[4:30:00] <OswaldTheDog> @illusivesaint you might be onto something there....
[4:30:18] <marcomatame> when are strange things *not* happening in the church?
[4:30:19] <aiutare47> @The_Gaming_Karp Its one of those things I read in a book that just stuck with me forever, like the capacity of m1897s
[4:30:26] <%Monkeyweed21> super real
[4:30:29] <+JobbedBone> @cumurasame I really don't think the writers intended to cast him as someone with pre-existing DID who THEN did brain damage that gave himself major amnesia. the voices are couched in his experiences, explicitly
[4:30:33] <+Jiggisnipe> oh
[4:30:37] <+Jiggisnipe> she does party PogChamp

[4:31:03] <%emperordread> There are empathy shoes in the church
[4:31:03] <%bevyrage> take off your boots
[4:31:12] <%hax_metatron> They totally should mod this so you can pick a skill and outfits you maxing that skill or something
[4:31:15] <%Jeshk0> yeah put on your empathy shoes
[4:31:15] <DianaTheAscian> wow thats it
[4:31:21] <cumurasame> @JobbedBone Uh, have you played the whole game? I'm pretty sure he may have had a condition

[4:31:22] <derap41> give her a hat
[4:31:26] <%dork_doggler> he;s thinking another armor
[4:31:27] <ingman112> White check, so you can retry
[4:31:34] <+egalitarian696969> i get up every morning and put on my empathy pants
[4:31:38] <Zap_Rowsdower32> It's the chest armor that reduces empathy
[4:31:47] <%Piemono> Why do cop glasses make you more empathetic?
[4:32:00] <ammobasket> @egalitarian696969 they understand you so well

[5:24:52] <%emperordread> Vibe check: who is your favourite teen of the group?
[5:24:54] <$metzselaar> Good catch
[5:24:54] <%Uselesswhitenoise> SING FOR ME DISCO MAN
[5:25:00] <%Uselesswhitenoise> SING YOUR SAD SONGS
[5:25:01] <%VyperVic> you'll want drama for the karaoke
[5:25:02] <Blank9> save before karaoke so you can hear both
[5:25:05] <+GingerStrawhat> Remember to pick up that ribbon tape on the way by the bridge
[5:25:06] <+neonNeptunian> egg head
[5:25:07] <penitentpendant> He's got an hour and 20 in game, folks
[5:25:07] <%elhafnero> @emperordread egg
[5:25:07] <vilecrois> A gun to shoot the crab man with
[5:25:08] <wolfen091> screw gun we got disco
[5:25:08] <%SteinsApprentice> No Gangstar Crab then
[5:25:08] <@StridentSong> Did you use the payphone yet?
[5:25:09] <%Mucmaster> Sing and then get the gun
[5:25:10] <%torusendor> @emperordread Egg Head without contest
[5:25:11] <%VyperVic> as in gear
[5:25:14] <%hax_metatron> Fast travel?
[5:25:17] <%dork_doggler> there's a fast travel poiunt in front of the church btw
[5:25:20] <Blank9> yeah, he payphoned
[5:25:22] <@StridentSong> Yeap
[5:25:27] <dds333a> Time to choose your OPUS
[5:25:28] <%Alazull> You're right next to where you meet up for the gun
[5:25:30] <%hax_metatron> Huh strange
[5:25:30] <penitentpendant> @dork_doggler It bugged
[5:25:34] <+justianxix> big oof
[5:25:36] <%dork_doggler> it does that sometimes you have to restart
[5:25:36] <ingman112> I think as soon as you unlock the church, it stops working. I had the same experience
[5:25:37] <penitentpendant> May need a save/load
[5:25:38] <ingman112> Just a bug
[5:25:38] <%emperordread> Hardcore, the place to be. Yekokata!
[5:25:38] <%thedankestmeeme> plot travel?
[5:25:46] <moonmeh> i could never get fast travel to work
[5:25:48] <derap41> Don't forget the tape
[5:25:49] <$hooppawesomeness> fast travel worked like twice for me and then never again
[5:25:52] <%JusTTheGuyYouNeed> too hard-core to fast travel
[5:25:56] <penitentpendant> The game jams on occassion, and travel doesn't take in game time at least
[5:25:57] <user_naim> We got super depressed, then listened to HARDCORE music in tent for like two hours
[5:25:57] <%bread_assassin> @PatStaresAt I emphatically recommend saving before doing karaoke to see both pass and fail. They are both worth it,
[5:26:02] <penitentpendant> Thanks Shivers!
[5:26:03] <%Uselesswhitenoise> thanks shivers
[5:26:03] <digaogrunge> its a bug, it breaks for everyone
[5:26:05] <%Arancet> can you believe the pay phone isnt the worst thing in the game either?
[5:26:06] <%Alazull> Karaoke?
[5:26:14] <%Ranryu692> I think the communist meeting automatically goes to 2am, so maybe leave that for last
[5:26:16] <%admiral_of_crunch> Jogging is hardcore
[5:26:20] <+RoByte2> My fast travel stopped working on day 4, and started working again after *STORY*
[5:26:22] <ingman112> @Arancet Shush
[5:26:26] <reonome> PISS OFF TREE
[5:26:31] <user_naim> I never got this, interesting
[5:26:33] <penitentpendant> ...that was probably yours
[5:26:34] <+Glass_Muffin> @PatStaresAt For me the fast travel stopped working at times. What I did is that you go a luttle bit to one of the main areas like outside the cafe or in the middle of the fishing village and it works again
[5:26:47] <%walternatorz> YOU MONSTER

[5:34:43] <user_naim> i’m hyped to see this succeed where i failed
[5:34:45] <%hax_metatron> I would often go there. To the tiny church there. The smallest church in Saint-Saëns -- though it once was larger. How the rill may rest there. Down through the mist there. Toward the seven sisters -- toward those pale cliffs there I would often stay there. In the tiny yard there. I have been so glad here -- looking forward to the past here
[5:34:46] <Blank9> this was fully voiced in the original too
[5:34:47] <BerryliciousDefinition> bakamitai....

[5:34:58] <mortificent> Leonard Cohen?
[5:34:58] <%GarbageNirvana> Oh man I was really hoping that was actually his voice
[5:35:00] <reonome> DAME YO
[5:35:01] <DianaTheAscian> Am I gonna cry?
[5:35:02] <+ALazo> can we see the fail too?
[5:35:03] <Yakobro> I would often go there. To the tiny church there. The smallest church in Saint-Saëns -- though it once was larger. How the rill may rest there. Down through the mist there. Toward the seven sisters -- toward those pale cliffs there I would often stay there. In the tiny yard there. I have been so glad here -- looking forward to the past here
[5:35:05] <%jorniev> @hax_metatron SO GOOD, and sad

[5:35:09] <NanoHologuise> I would often go there. To the tiny church there. The smallest church in Saint-Saëns -- though it once was larger. How the rill may rest there. Down through the mist there. Toward the seven sisters -- toward those pale cliffs there I would often stay there. In the tiny yard there. I have been so glad here -- looking forward to the past here
[5:35:12] <DSD24> Man hearing Harry's voice is weird
[5:35:17] <cardamomo88> ARE YOU SEING HIS SOUL

[5:35:24] <derap41> and the old lady
[5:35:25] <ingman112> It's ARB
[5:35:28] <+neonNeptunian> this is based off a song from British Sea Power
[5:35:28] <HeroToxiko> why does this sound like the intro of true detective season 2?
[5:35:29] <ingman112> Not quite Harry
[5:35:29] <%Mucmaster> I would often go there. To the tiny church there. The smallest church in Saint-Saëns -- though it once was larger. How the rill may rest there. Down through the mist there. Toward the seven sisters -- toward those pale cliffs there I would often stay there. In the tiny yard there. I have been so glad here -- looking forward to the past here
[5:35:29] <mortificent> Damn, this is very Leonard Cohen

[5:35:33] <DianaTheAscian> Wait is this his canon voice?
[5:35:36] <%Jeshk0> abcoBanale abcoGerrt abcoBanale abcoGerrt
[5:35:37] <reonome> ancient reptilian brain is harry's canon voice i guess
[5:35:40] <JimJamr> The voice actor is also the singer of his band too
[5:35:42] <+GingerStrawhat> This to me is his canon voice even though limbic system is also kind of like that
[5:35:46] <ItsPastas> this is Ancient Reptilian Brain singing
[5:35:49] <%torusendor> I havebeen so glad there
[5:35:49] <+SammyOVision> Depending on if you succeed or fail, Ancient Reptillian Brain or Limbic System will sing
[5:35:50] <%admiral_of_crunch> Harry sounds like a gravel driveway
[5:35:51] <NeroInfinite> yeah it's his voice.

[5:51:24] <aiutare47> @toolofparanoia Harry doesnt strike me as a bottom
[5:51:26] <televisedrevolting> Damn
[5:51:28] <%illusiveSaint> maybe Harry just like to party and open minded KappaPride
[5:51:29] <derap41> Running is faster
[5:51:37] <Yakobro> @PatStaresAt fast travel just straight broke for me for the last half of the game
[5:51:42] <%arcielardor> that's a bug you need to reset for
[5:51:43] <aiutare47> I cant see Harry as a bottom
[5:51:44] <Blank9> Harry could be a bottom if he has a high pain threshold
[5:51:48] <dmtjinni> What happened?
[5:51:53] <%Piemono> sometimes you have to be very close to specific areas
[5:51:53] <%Piemen99> HELL YEAH I LOVE NO SINGAL

[5:52:05] <user_naim> real disco hours
[5:52:05] <%Uselesswhitenoise> im addicted to this game
[5:52:07] <Tisaric> the game is extremely addicting once you get into it
[5:52:11] <$hattrick61> Harry is absolutely a bottom, life keeps fucking him in the ass so why not everyone else?

[5:52:13] <NeutrinoInteraction> Fine with us
[5:52:14] <+Vigonept> i didnt know fast travel was a thing. i clicked the things and it never did anything
[5:52:14] <%GarbageNirvana> You trying to finish this shit tonight?
[5:52:14] <Parapattern> I beat this game four times and never knew it had fast travel
[5:52:17] <fairore> oh hyeah
[5:52:17] <derap41> Just don't spoil for Woolie
[5:52:18] <+BusterRepukken> a bunch of stuff is out soon
[5:52:18] <%cobalt_phoenix_> this game is the epitome of "just one more conversation" and then an hour has passed
[5:52:20] <%dalmek> I'm peacing out to sleep. Have a great rest of stream
[5:52:21] <BerryliciousDefinition> !uptime
[5:52:21] <@Moobot> @BerryliciousDefinition I've been playing this game for how long? Oh only 5h 52m.
[5:52:22] <+GingerStrawhat> That's true
[5:52:22] <%Broken_Sonex> Yeah better attack this now then
[5:52:22] <televisedrevolting> Shit damn we might not see this for another week.
[5:52:22] <dd44dostivei> are you still doing mass effect
[5:52:27] <TheAntiNihilist> how much longer?
[5:52:29] <%dork_doggler> wow, really?
[5:52:30] <penitentpendant> Curse you bugs!
[5:52:30] <+MrAtheGreat> @RushUnplugged LUL I'll be sure to remember that
[5:52:30] <+BusterRepukken> returnal, re8
[5:52:31] <faithless_zealot> Unfortunately, I will not be watching those streams until i beat that game
[5:52:34] <Oxybe> @patstaresat have you tried the monhunt update stuff yet?
[5:52:34] <ingman112> One more thing Pat: you can check with Joyce for new dialogue on your way, if you're so inclined
[5:52:35] <+JustToWatch> and returnal is supposed to be really good
[5:52:36] <%thelaxinator> oh christ it's 1 am
[5:52:36] <Press_X_ToJASON> @Parapattern if it was before 4 weeks ago, it didnt have it
[5:52:37] <%toolofparanoia> Maybe harry is a switch with a preference to top?
[5:52:38] <NeutrinoInteraction> Yeah it worked for like the first day for me and then was just gone
[5:52:39] <%Sveargieth> It might be a night time limitation
[5:52:40] <+MrAtheGreat> that sucks man
[5:52:44] <Foymic> better for it to break then the story i guess
[5:52:44] <%jorniev> happened to me too
[5:52:46] <%athuramn> is there more vignetting the later it gets?
[5:52:48] <%JusTTheGuyYouNeed> you can probably beat the game this week at this pace
[5:52:57] <+Glass_Muffin> @PatStaresAt For me, fast travel also broke for me mid game. IT would only work if i go to thje main sections on the map and fast travel from there. For example outside the whirling in rags or the fishing village
[5:52:58] <aiutare47> What about Coach Physical Instrument, or Authority? Dudes a major top, roman style.
[5:53:00] <%Piemono> Pat hasn't even done the cryptozoologists yet
[5:53:02] <+BusterRepukken> yeah but returnal is like 90 dollars canadian because 70 dollar games are now a thing
[5:53:04] <%jorniev> HOW ABOUT GUN?
[5:53:04] <+RushUnplugged> you couuuuld in theory speedline to the end but it's a big waste of a lot of good content
[5:53:05] <%GarbageNirvana> I hope Returnal is good because that name is dumb as shit
[5:53:08] <%dork_doggler> @PatStaresAt if you talk to joyce at 2 am and pass a passive you learn something neat
[5:53:11] <%toolofparanoia> THIS GAME IS FUCKING MAGICAL
[5:53:18] <+polothegreatest> is disco the new civ5?
[5:53:19] <%Monkeyweed21> same
[5:53:22] <fairore> peace out yall im going to sleep
[5:53:27] <ingman112> Oh you'll want Kim there for that though
[5:53:33] <penitentpendant> Kids bed time
[5:53:34] <Alfred_Waaghur> peace
[5:53:35] <+BusterRepukken> hey pat did you get the xenomorph and ripley skins
[5:53:40] <%VyperVic> @garbagenirvana i have heard good things about it from gigaboots
[5:53:43] <+Mizzda> What sort of cop does pat have, just tuning in
[5:53:49] <$metzselaar> Man, I get unkowning Bi feeling from Harry. I bet he can do both top and bottom.
[5:53:57] <ingman112> Sorry cop
[5:53:59] <%GarbageNirvana> Seems like a reliable source
[5:53:59] <aiutare47> @Mizzda a lot, commie sorry mainly
[5:53:59] <%VyperVic> art gay communist cop
[5:54:01] <ingman112> Plus communist
[5:54:02] <%jorniev> did he do the gun thing?
[5:54:13] <%VyperVic> not yet
[5:54:16] <aiutare47> @metzselaar Hes too Phys to bottom I think
[5:54:31] <%VyperVic> that went well.
[5:54:37] <%Jeshk0> my doggy pooped don the floor last night :/
[5:54:39] <DianaTheAscian> Pat's in the zone today
[5:54:46] <%YakumoYomi> But is that poop HARD CORE?!
[5:54:49] <Vyskus> fast travel breaks with the update apparently
[5:54:51] <%admiral_of_crunch> Now this is some Anodic Dance Music.
[5:54:53] <+Mizzda> commie/free market sorry cop was my first playthrough, I got this game 3 days ago and I'm on my second go round already
[5:54:53] <%VyperVic> i wonder if we can get the date to go off
[5:55:00] <%Jeshk0> OHH YEAAH
[5:55:01] <%athuramn> the energy drink an hour ago might've had something to do with it
[5:55:27] <%YakumoYomi> INTERNALLY COHERENT!
[5:55:31] <%Uselesswhitenoise> oh i just checked his quest list
[5:55:33] <%toolofparanoia> This game has hit all the right switches in my brain.
[5:55:39] <%Uselesswhitenoise> im so glad he got the spirt drink
[5:55:46] <%toolofparanoia> Really gets the neurons firing
[5:56:01] <%VyperVic> art synergizes with commie, superstar with ultralib, apocalypse with fascist, and sorry cop with moralist
[5:56:12] <DianaTheAscian> shame the console version of this is bad apparently
[5:56:24] <%Uselesswhitenoise> I think everyone who plays this game, after three or four normal runs, should do a cheat run where they save edit all the stats to max
[5:56:27] <%Uselesswhitenoise> SO much content
[5:56:32] <%GarbageNirvana> !uptime
[5:56:32] <@Moobot> @GarbageNirvana I've been playing this game for how long? Oh only 5h 56m.
[5:56:34] <aiutare47> @DianaTheAscian it doesnt translate well to controler
[5:56:43] <%GarbageNirvana> Christ almighty
[5:56:46] <penitentpendant> @Uselesswhitenoise The real trick is to make sure he wears the Tie to trigger the follow up
[5:57:02] <DianaTheAscian> @aiutare47 damn
[5:57:10] <%Uselesswhitenoise> yeah, tie needs its redemption arc
[5:57:24] <dmtjinni> stream over?
[5:57:29] <%VyperVic> oh, tie will get his redemption arc
[5:57:29] <penitentpendant> @Uselesswhitenoise The lore alone it gives
[5:57:30] <aiutare47> @DianaTheAscian its hard to do all the clicking on containers and the like
[5:57:32] <%Uselesswhitenoise> no dog popin
[5:57:33] <%VyperVic> not yet
[5:58:16] <DianaTheAscian> @aiutare47 do they plan to fix it/clean it up or no?
[5:58:23] <dmtjinni> Did Pat meet the crypto guy?
[5:58:34] <%VyperVic> not yet
[5:58:41] <%cobalt_phoenix_> not yet
[5:58:41] <penitentpendant> @dmtjinni Doom spiral?
[5:58:53] <%VyperVic> he also hasn't talked to the guy by the feld building
[5:58:59] <aiutare47> @DianaTheAscian No clue, bit personally im not sure how it could be tidied up, its just built for a mouse.
[5:59:07] <%trllly> If Pat had a Patreon where he uploaded a podcast with him, Paige, and Eli where they talk about the dumb shows they watch, i would sub...
[5:59:15] <dmtjinni> @penitentpendant the scientist looking for aliens
[5:59:17] <%VyperVic> he has not gone in church yet, either
[5:59:27] <DianaTheAscian> @aiutare47 man that sucks
[5:59:29] <penitentpendant> @dmtjinni Nope
[5:59:45] <%VyperVic> @dmtjinni not aliens, cryptids
[5:59:49] <%Uselesswhitenoise> pat paige and plague is such a good talking combo
[6:00:08] <%Uselesswhitenoise> theres just too much Content in this game
[6:00:20] <dmtjinni> @VyperVic i forgot how to spell that shit lol
[6:00:24] <%Uselesswhitenoise> He's seen so much, yet there is so much more
[6:00:28] <DianaTheAscian> I'm happy/very mad Titan Fall 2 is getting popular on steam

[6:11:12] <derap41> Mad is a stong word
[6:11:13] <ingman112> When you're being weird it's a little off-putting, ueah

[6:11:15] <NeroInfinite> yeah.
[6:11:16] <+JustToWatch> concerned

[6:11:42] <ingman112> Gotta go around
[6:11:43] <%JusTTheGuyYouNeed> around
[6:11:43] <penitentpendant> It's a weird path

[6:11:47] <hippofant> Wow I have legitimately never seen this task before
[6:11:47] <%Agami23> does harry get results or something?? because i would be worried if someone said "the wind told me to talk to the children".
[6:11:50] <aiutare47> He's off put, you just told him "The wind told me to speak to kids" What is he supposed to do
[6:11:55] <$hattrick61> Go be fair " The wind told me to talk to children" is a bit odd to say the least
[6:12:00] <@StridentSong> Harry gets *a lot* of results
[6:12:05] <%walternatorz> you have been running all day with the only breaks to wash some laundry and sing karoake

[6:58:17] <+xTJPBQdfNHA7qUxeTd5Uy9gV> it's an overly elaborate metaphor about hope and failure
[6:58:27] <%TIME_PUNCHER> just like real communism
[6:58:27] <%jorniev> NEW MUSIC
[6:58:29] <%thomassolorio> communism in a nut shell

[6:58:39] <%Urgotfantasy> shut up drama
[6:58:43] <NeutrinoInteraction> I dated someone who looks exactly like Echo Maker in college and it continues to freak me the hell out
[6:58:43] <+Zeromaru2> What you thought there would be real Communism? Fool that you are, like a poorly built matchstick tower
[6:58:46] <aiutare47> Dude I’ve met a handful of communists and half of them look like this
[6:59:02] <%TIME_PUNCHER> IT'S AS IF LENIN WERE IN THE ROOM
[6:59:03] <+emperri> LUL
[6:59:04] <+StatesmanPrimal> yoooo we sith lords now?

[6:59:33] <+mental_mashup> Kim did the reading for sure
[6:59:35] <penitentpendant> Ha
[6:59:36] <+mczarklesby> Sir. SIR. Telling me to read is an imperialism.
[6:59:36] <%DiscoMatador> Read Theory
[6:59:39] <ignorum> WHOOPS
[6:59:44] <%DiscoMatador> lol
[6:59:51] <+lukausedsteal> FUCK this is on point
[6:59:53] <$metzselaar> Music going HARD
[6:59:56] <%dork_doggler> This is just young Stalin and young Trotsky

[7:00:03] <+senfood> He's NOT WRONG
[7:00:18] <+emperri> LUL
[7:00:31] <%jorniev> man pat might trigger an aending here
[7:00:39] <JimJamr> A communist book club
[7:00:39] <%jorniev> or not
[7:00:44] <%jorniev> i dont even now
[7:00:45] <derap41> Echo Maker is the right name for that guy
[7:00:50] <ingman112> @jorniev I don't think so? Might be thinking of a different quest
[7:00:53] <%TIME_PUNCHER> Communist LARPers
[7:00:58] <+lukausedsteal> the biggest metaphors
[7:01:00] <ingman112> @jorniev Either way let's not mention it too much
[7:01:05] <ignorum> haha yo this is my jam *does kickflip*
[7:01:12] <+GingerStrawhat> Thier Hipster Communists
[7:01:13] <%dork_doggler> @TIME_PUNCHER naw these guys are super authentic
[7:01:19] <NeutrinoInteraction> "We don't like parroting things" "SQUAAAAK that's right, we don't parrot things!"
[7:01:24] <%GarbageNirvana> Fuckin...student communists
[7:01:32] <NeroInfinite> drop outs
[7:01:33] <DSD24> Pat sounds tired
[7:01:35] <aiutare47> This is all of them. They’re dweebs. Super hardline dweebs. No praxis. Just dweebs. Like 80% of communist organizations in America are just like this. Right down to the young white middle class kids.
[7:01:37] <ingman112> At a certain point the LARPers are the closest thing left to "authentic"
[7:01:38] <JimJamr> So theyre drop outs
[7:01:41] <$hattrick61> post-attendence
[7:01:45] <tanarath> Fantastic
[7:01:45] <%SilvaChariot0133> Che and Trotsky RPers?
[7:01:46] <%TIME_PUNCHER> at least they're reading?
[7:01:50] <%jorniev> fuck that one dude who pretended to be my friend who was like this
[7:01:51] <heartlesshealer> oh boy
[7:01:54] <+GingerStrawhat> I think anyone on a campus knows these guys
[7:01:55] <+JonathLP> "Post-attendance"
[7:01:56] <+mczarklesby> They are eternal.
[7:01:56] <ignorum> post-attendance haha
[7:01:58] <user_naim> Shit I might still become one of these losers
[7:01:59] <penitentpendant> Pat took Morale Damage there
[7:02:00] <%dork_doggler> @PatStaresAt I know what you mean, but they turn out well, don't be mean
[7:02:01] <+mental_mashup> These guys FUCK
[7:02:01] <%Uselesswhitenoise> Im these guys
[7:02:02] <%DiscoMatador> oh no
[7:02:04] <derap41> The Pain in Pat
[7:02:10] <+ju_ten> echo maker can lowkey get it
[7:02:11] <Alfred_Waaghur> Just a couple of idealist, intellectually inclined youths. Disappointing.
[7:02:15] <NeroInfinite> I knew a guy like that LUL
[7:02:19] <aiutare47> @uselesswhitenoise Don’t be please
[7:02:20] <+StatesmanPrimal> BREAAK DOWN THE WAAALLS
[7:02:20] <%dork_doggler> What the fuck is Praxis?
[7:02:20] <chippybippers> ONLY READ
[7:02:21] <heartlesshealer> familiarity breeds contempt
[7:02:21] <%Monkeyweed21> I was one of these guys for like a year
[7:02:23] <JimJamr> Read about the System!
[7:02:23] <%weissguard> Kappa
[7:02:24] <%TIME_PUNCHER> These are the people who watch too much Zeitgeist
[7:02:24] <%muetank> LARPers and debate-bros
[7:02:26] <UnsteadyFunk> These guys smell their own farts, but the guy in the glasses smells his farts THEN smells the farts of the guy that looks like Danny from Game Grumps
[7:02:28] <%Mucmaster> They're all theory while Harry is all praxis
[7:02:28] <+SammyOVision> No practice, only theory
[7:02:35] <%dork_doggler> praxis is anarchist idealism
[7:02:39] <aiutare47> GO TO A SOUP KITCHEN NERD
[7:02:45] <+mczarklesby> But not like, just ANY theory, The only place you learn the theory is like, in REALITY.
[7:02:45] <%thomassolorio> fucking drop outs
[7:02:45] <+StatesmanPrimal> I thought pat WAS the zeitgeist
[7:02:46] <%jorniev> no succses only FAILIURE

[7:02:46] <+projectmanatees> i hate these guys
[7:02:47] <%TIME_PUNCHER> LUL
[7:02:48] <peyodogo> theory is pretty sick tbf
[7:02:50] <+GingerStrawhat> This is litterally how Communism started in Russia
[7:02:51] <ingman112> STARBUCKS IS THE WORKING MAN'S WATER
[7:02:52] <+lukausedsteal> every "communist" in high school and college
[7:02:52] <NeroInfinite> EXACTLY
[7:02:53] <%DashXero> To be fair, if they started talking about taking drastic actions, it would weird you out.
[7:02:54] <NeutrinoInteraction> "Here read this 500 page book written in 1860's Germany OR ELSE I WON'T RESPECT YOU"
[7:02:56] <+Zeromaru2> LUL
[7:02:57] <%Uselesswhitenoise> hell yeah
[7:02:58] <+mental_mashup> We all get to the point where we realize the system is fucked and then you move on and realize there’s nothing you can do
[7:03:00] <vilecrois> Throwing down capitalism, triple mocha macciato now
[7:03:01] <%VyperVic> OH MY GOD
[7:03:01] <nevan_44> LUL
[7:03:03] <+mczarklesby> Voting is ALSO imperialism.
[7:03:05] <vilecrois> *later
[7:03:08] <ingman112> Just you wait, press onward
[7:03:13] <%dork_doggler> To be fair, in the US you can count the votes that count on the ballot sheet one a couple fingers
[7:03:14] <%VyperVic> VOTE OR DIE, YOU FUCKS
[7:03:16] <+mczarklesby> Voting, making me read theory, the dishes? IMPERIALISM.
[7:03:23] <marcomatame> just came back
[7:03:23] <+emperri> oop
[7:03:27] <marcomatame> what'd i miss
[7:03:28] <%Mucmaster> Arrest these nerds for truancy
[7:03:29] <%Ranryu692> of course
[7:03:29] <%DashXero> Also, you'd probably report them if they started naming targets to eliminate.
[7:03:31] <+ju_ten> direct action maaaaaan
[7:03:31] <%thomassolorio> yo it's legit 11 05 here right now lol
[7:03:36] <%Monkeyweed21> LOOK AT PAT AND HIS *IMPERIALIST* IDEAS

[7:04:33] <aiutare47> REVISION oh god the writers knew these people well
[7:04:34] <peyodogo> capitalism didnt work either
[7:04:34] <comicalmond9135> 2 am let's goooo
[7:04:35] <%TIME_PUNCHER> based
[7:04:35] <%linSP> how could this happun
[7:04:37] <NeroInfinite> shocker
[7:04:38] <Visorak6> BUT THE SAUSAGE GRINDER PAT
[7:04:38] <vapidq> lol
[7:04:40] <DSD24> This is really nice
[7:04:40] <%mads_valentine> Anarchism is where the real shit is at!
[7:04:41] <%JusTTheGuyYouNeed> no shit
[7:04:41] <chippybippers> but BUILD IT still
[7:04:43] <+RoByte2> The world literally got together and said "NO" I think that's a sign
[7:04:44] <UnsteadyFunk> BUT IT WASN'T REAL COMMUNISM THO /s
[7:04:44] <derap41> That's still happening
[7:04:45] <DSD24> The music I mean
[7:04:47] <%Mucmaster> I read all about those linens man
[7:04:48] <%jorniev> i can agree with that
[7:04:50] <+ju_ten> oh no
[7:04:51] <%thomassolorio> still mad fucky
[7:04:52] <+GingerStrawhat> Like that guy whose in charge may seem cool but it's almost impossible for him to not go corrupt
[7:04:53] <+ju_ten> pats a lib
[7:04:59] <NeroInfinite> It's still happening. LUL
[7:04:59] <%DiscoMatador> Gotta Go for Anarchism Fam that shits never failed
[7:04:59] <+emperri> but it wasn't REAL communism
[7:05:01] <ASpiffyGoat> Marx diagnosed the problem
[7:05:03] <+lukausedsteal> Marx had his shit together. But then everyone lost the shit and incurred mass human rights violations
[7:05:03] <%jorniev> music is pretty good
[7:05:03] <%GarbageNirvana> No one's capable of sufficiently maintaining the systems that communism would require to be in place for it to fully work
[7:05:06] <%VyperVic> @mads_valentine based and Ukrainian black army-pilled
[7:05:08] <%OrangeMDT> Woah, how is this stream still going
[7:05:08] <vilecrois> No political ideology survives contact with actual humans seems like
[7:05:09] <%TIME_PUNCHER> whens the PSAbased emoji
[7:05:11] <%athuramn> not gonna happen while starbucks is around lol
[7:05:12] <%Nordguy> What are you, an *Incrementalist*?
[7:05:12] <%Monkeyweed21> but Pat, what if we just ignore power relationships that naturally form between people REALLY REALLY HARD @PatStaresAt
[7:05:13] <dmtjinni> lib
[7:05:14] <%GarbageNirvana> So it just ends up turning into fascism again
[7:05:15] <%Uselesswhitenoise> YES
[7:05:15] <aiutare47> He was dead wrong about transitional governments though
[7:05:21] <ingman112> I think this is best exemplified if you turn down the OG Communism thought and your volition is high enough. Volition chimes in and says "You SHOULD build communism. BECAUSE it's impossible"
[7:05:23] <vapidq> voting is so effective
[7:05:25] <Press_X_ToJASON> Harrier is just bvuilt different, he can make it work LUL
[7:05:28] <vapidq> people just dont vote
[7:05:30] <+GingerStrawhat> Have you ever seen Noah Gervais video on this game Pat? It talks almost exactly about this.
[7:05:32] <%dork_doggler> It was going to happen, but capitalism got Edward Bernays and it was all over
[7:05:34] <%jorniev> KILL TONS OF PEOPLE
[7:05:34] <%athuramn> we gonna break bank windows sir @PatStaresAt
[7:05:35] <+emperri> the complaining mostly
[7:05:37] <Alfred_Waaghur> Pat for Kingdom of Conscience confirmed.
[7:05:40] <NeutrinoInteraction> Yeah Marx got like 75% of stuff completely right and then REALLY fucked up that last 25%
[7:05:43] <peyodogo> maybe not in canada. over here there's plenty of hope for communism
[7:05:46] <%mads_valentine> Remember Makhnovia!
[7:05:46] <%illusiveSaint> no but communism is still young stop it :(
[7:05:46] <%Urgotfantasy> kim could build communism if only he was a communist
[7:05:48] <%thomassolorio> inact your own policy naw burn it all down
[7:05:50] <+JustToWatch> @PatStaresAt Pat you idiot. We're obviously gonna post about it
[7:05:52] <digaogrunge> YES
[7:05:52] <dds333a> If anyone can do it, really.
[7:05:53] <+lukausedsteal> with your little mallets and chisels yeah
[7:05:53] <+emperri> OH GOD
[7:05:56] <%Monkeyweed21> WHAT IF WE JUST KILL ALL THE SMART PEOPLE?
[7:05:59] <marcomatame> The problem with "power to the people" is that the people are scary, "the people" would kill me in the streets for my sexual preferences in some parts of the world. lol
[7:06:00] <+emperri> HOW DO YOU HOLD A HAMMER BTW
[7:06:01] <%Uselesswhitenoise> Read Foucault
[7:06:01] <Press_X_ToJASON> @vapidq and those who do mostly just pick the letter they like
[7:06:02] <%jorniev> DANGEROUSLY CLOSE TO ACERTAIN SUPER SENATOR
[7:06:03] <%emperordread> I love that the mere concept of communism is intrinsicly tied to failure in this game
[7:06:06] <ingman112> I love that this is all it took to break Pat
[7:06:07] <%dork_doggler> that's a real first-world perspective, Pat
[7:06:08] <%TIME_PUNCHER> listen, Pat. They really resonate with Rage Against The Machine
[7:06:12] <ingman112> Just meeting these guys
[7:06:12] <aiutare47> Y’all gonna work in soup kitchens? Y’all gonna build homes? Y’all gonna set up support networks?
[7:06:13] <derap41> Communism is to easily hijacked and requires to much theory for the common man
[7:06:18] <+StatesmanPrimal> communism only works if you're an insect based hive heirarchy
[7:06:18] <%Arancet> marx brilliantly broke down the problem, the problems with his solution
[7:06:19] <+GingerStrawhat> Marx had some wild ideas that People are not naturally corrupt if they are of the working class
[7:06:22] <%GarbageNirvana> Personally I think we should abolish nations entirely and just go back to raw tribalism, it's all the industry that fucked everything up for us
[7:06:23] <%athuramn> we're offended, cancel this man!
[7:06:24] <+lukausedsteal> We're gonna start a communist Kickstarter
[7:06:25] <+GingerStrawhat> Which is all sorts of bullshit
[7:06:28] <+emperri> I'm going to PRINT MY MESSAGE ON A HAMMER and then chisel a window in the most unwatchably sad manner possible
[7:06:33] <%dork_doggler> I know. I don't know why I said that. Knee-jerk communism
[7:06:35] <Frostydough1> @patstaresat they literally gentrified taking down the system holy shits it’s hilarious
[7:06:36] <derap41> literally cannot  have another perspective
[7:06:37] <%TIME_PUNCHER> Occupy Wallstreet tho
[7:06:39] <NeroInfinite> I'd work in a soup kitchen if I could
[7:06:40] <%jorniev> I LIVE INTHE INFRA WORLD, IT DOESNT WORK HERE
[7:06:41] <+StatesmanPrimal> and then it doesn't work because they need a leader figure
[7:06:44] <aiutare47> God damn I knew some many of these people and it pisses me off so hard
[7:06:50] <derap41> @TIME_PUNCHER Did fuck all
[7:06:53] <%dork_doggler> Chinese call them Baizou
[7:06:55] <%illusiveSaint> communism works better for 3rd world countries if they got the talent
[7:06:56] <+projectmanatees> pat i need that on a poster
[7:06:59] <%s_xylocalsingles> people who read theory without doing any actual critical work and care for their community are coward frauds and should be shamed
[7:07:00] <peyodogo> maybe you're stuck there, pat, the global south is lookin mighty different though
[7:07:04] <%DiscoMatador> Like Channel That Energy into something actually helpful like fucking with homeless Architecture or something man
[7:07:07] <+StatesmanPrimal> like actually you need to be a hivemind for communism to work
[7:07:07] <ingman112> Nice timing Echo
[7:07:08] <aiutare47> ALL OF THEM YES
[7:07:08] <%TIME_PUNCHER> @derap41 psaBig
[7:07:10] <%jorniev> IT. DOES. NOT. WORK.
[7:07:15] <Alfred_Waaghur> Don't hate them too hard. Something fun might happen here.
[7:07:19] <%Broken_Sonex> @TIME_PUNCHER People forgot and no longer care
[7:07:21] <+mental_mashup> I like fortnite too much to be a communist
[7:07:21] <Profmcstevie> Why shouldn't I shit my pants, they'd pop me
[7:07:23] <aiutare47> Fuckin dweebs
[7:07:28] <+ReallyBigRocks> Pretty advanced stuff Pat
[7:07:29] <%athuramn> why does manana know these guys
[7:07:35] <%Ranryu692> you definitely want to go along with them for the content
[7:07:35] <moonmeh> ah trotksy
[7:07:37] <@Moobot> I don't know if I can trust that. (@hattrick61) (warning)
[7:07:44] <marcomatame> @emperordread Um, I wonder why.
[7:07:49] <%GarbageNirvana> I mean we all know the real answer is return to monke
[7:07:49] <%Ranryu692> @athuramn the communal power of cigarettes
[7:08:00] <%athuramn> ahh

[7:08:21] <+emperri> work
[7:08:22] <%Uselesswhitenoise> i love this
[7:08:22] <+projectmanatees> @Ranryu692 for real you give a dude a lighter in a smoking area you are like a blood brother
[7:08:22] <+mczarklesby> SPLITTERS!
[7:08:23] <+StatesmanPrimal> I swear, communism only works if everyone works toward a common goal altruistically, and humans are usually bad at that
[7:08:26] <%DashXero> Naw!
[7:08:28] <+JonWhoLovesFlatWomen> YEAH
[7:08:29] <%TIME_PUNCHER> Pat alienating his hardcore communist twitch fanbase again
[7:08:32] <+JustToWatch> That being said any criticism of the left that doesn't also come from the left is usually stupid or insane
[7:08:32] <+GingerStrawhat> They just wern't ready man!
[7:08:32] <NeroInfinite> Oh so they left because you guys were dumbasses. got it
[7:08:36] <aiutare47> Esoteric-communism?
[7:08:36] <+lukausedsteal> can we walk out now
[7:08:41] <Alfred_Waaghur> I can
[7:08:44] <%mads_valentine> @DiscoMatador Nah, more like Posad nerds.
[7:08:46] <Alfred_Waaghur> I can't believe that
[7:08:47] <NeutrinoInteraction> @TIME_PUNCHER He's lost support of all 20 of us
[7:08:49] <%dork_doggler> @StatesmanPrimal so does capitalism and anarchism and literally all the other ones
[7:08:50] <$hattrick61> Pat is collapsing in on himself
[7:08:50] <aiutare47> YEYEYE
[7:08:52] <+StatesmanPrimal> I'm a transhumanist pat don't worry
[7:09:04] <+xTJPBQdfNHA7qUxeTd5Uy9gV> imagine discussing political themes through ways other than dry theory
[7:09:05] <jaketherelapses> is this like the 5thfinal stream for this game

[7:18:30] <akitanito> is this scientology now?
[7:18:30] <+emperri> Ecto-communism
[7:18:32] <NeroInfinite> MAGIC COMMIES LUL
[7:18:34] <Profmcstevie> SUPER COMMUNISM

[7:18:37] <chippybippers> they're talking about EARTHBOUND PSI
[7:18:38] <+StatesmanPrimal> this truly is the Soviet union
[7:18:38] <digaogrunge> aCTUAL mAGIC
[7:18:42] <+ReallyBigRocks> Please Pat, the term is Ideological plasm
[7:18:43] <$hattrick61> Cant believe danny phantom is a commie now
[7:18:44] <%DiscoMatador> GHOST COMMUNISM
[7:18:44] <ingman112> Don't you worry
[7:18:45] <%DashXero> Are they sure the matches weren't to light their huge blunts that they're keeping somewhere in there?
[7:18:46] <+xTJPBQdfNHA7qUxeTd5Uy9gV> ah yes psychic communism
[7:18:48] <moonmeh> I SUMMON LENIN TO STRIKE MY ENEMIES DOWN

[7:18:50] <+StatesmanPrimal> HYPER COMMUNISM
[7:18:50] <%jorniev> COMUNISM 2
[7:18:52] <+emperri> The plasm is made of pure copium
[7:18:52] <%GarbageNirvana> So I figure Ulixes' portrait being in front of bars has to do with the grating outside, but it also calls to mind bird in cage imagery, which goes back to that parroting thing they were talking about
[7:18:53] <akitanito> GRAND WIZARD OF COMMUNISM
[7:18:57] <twohitgood> stevie ray vaughn?
[7:18:57] <Blank9> we would need at least five articles on this to amass THAT much fatal communism
[7:18:57] <ammobasket> The level of society to kill and protect
[7:18:59] <%dork_doggler> This universe has Pale,. fuck it, we psychic
[7:19:01] <ASpiffyGoat> The Communists Who Stared at Goats
[7:19:03] <%Maids4lyfe> I KNEW PEOPLE LIKE THIS IN COLLEGE THEY WERE LIKE A CULT
[7:19:05] <%JusTTheGuyYouNeed> my communism is at level 4,you are dead buddy
[7:19:06] <+JonathLP> @PatStaresAt They think communism is literally their JoJo Stand.
[7:19:10] <+ju_ten> pat i literally don’t believe you and I don’t mean this in an antagonizing way
[7:19:10] <derap41> Supporting lynching wow
[7:19:11] <peyodogo> man do you people really only get these types of communists? kinda sad
[7:19:14] <%SilvaChariot0133> Man, kinda felt bad getting dunked on for playing centrist, but this is just sad LUL
[7:19:17] <+CammerTime21> This entire encounter is doing psychic damage to me
[7:19:18] <%GarbageNirvana> Suffice to say the artists for this game did a fucking phenomenal job
[7:19:20] <%athuramn> mcgill does have many of these
[7:19:24] <+StatesmanPrimal> yeah man, let's limit break and summon communist bahamut
[7:19:27] <dds333a> Communism: Rainbow Edition
[7:19:28] <+ju_ten> there is no way these guys exist in real life
[7:19:29] <DSD24> This music is really nice
[7:19:32] <$hattrick61> I've heard of red mages before but this is ridiculous
[7:19:34] <%Broken_Sonex> ME?!
[7:19:40] <%athuramn> @StatesmanPrimal fuck that got me
[7:19:42] <akitanito> so basically Amway
[7:19:43] <%emperordread> Measurehead looks a lot more reasonable under the comparison of communist goo
[7:19:44] <NeutrinoInteraction> A Primal, but Karl Marx
[7:19:45] <+StatesmanPrimal> I have legit met people like this
[7:19:46] <%GarbageNirvana> Have you BEEN to college
[7:19:47] <%cvp5127> LUL
[7:19:47] <moonmeh> oh man
[7:19:49] <derap41> NEver been to College ?
[7:19:51] <Blank9> if they convince you, you convince someone, and they convince someone, so the onus is no longer on them if they convince you
[7:19:52] <+RushUnplugged> the real life ones are WORSE
[7:19:52] <+lukausedsteal> HEY THEY DID I WAS ONE OF THEM FOR A BIT
[7:19:52] <32ndwizard> They do
[7:19:54] <%Mucmaster> Don't cha know if we embrace communism all racism will stop
[7:19:54] <SixthShinx> Kappa
[7:19:54] <%Monkeyweed21> OH MAN
[7:19:57] <%TIME_PUNCHER> "Then they fight you, then you win" is the dumbest line I keep hearing
[7:19:58] <+Dragon4234> I've got bad news for you then
[7:19:58] <+tigerfang86> the CRUST of Irony
[7:19:58] <YumAntimatter> communist wizards are very real lol
[7:19:59] <heartlesshealer> People don't know people in chat LUL
[7:20:00] <+StatesmanPrimal> ah yes, the Primal Karl Marx
[7:20:02] <ingman112> And now here's the thing: there's something ELSE under the surface with these guys
[7:20:02] <%SveriSageAdvice> do you even know what real life is my dear sir
[7:20:05] <+tigerfang86> IRONIC LAYERS
[7:20:06] <aiutare47> god this is so so so accurate, This has in fact convinced me that all communists are the same and we all just met the same people
[7:20:07] <%illusiveSaint> his has to be satire or a parody on an actual theory LUL
[7:20:13] <aiutare47> ACCURATE
[7:20:15] <+RushUnplugged> they're basically sports fans whose team is Communist FC
[7:20:15] <%muetank> If there is psychic communism. Is there also fire type or grass type communism???
[7:20:17] <mass1997> Of couse
[7:20:17] <marcomatame> I've never understood why modern communists think they'll be the ones to call the shots if communism takes over. You're likely to be ruled by a militia rather than capital, that's the only pertinent change your middle class life will experience.
[7:20:22] <%Uselesswhitenoise> all the poor communists are in third world conutries
[7:20:24] <+SammyOVision> They just so happen to have the safety net behind them.
[7:20:24] <%emperordread> @Blank9 Like a monkey's paw of communist theory
[7:20:26] <%Uselesswhitenoise> like mine
[7:20:26] <Blank9> I have, they're dirt poor.
[7:20:31] <+emperri> "eat the rich! but not me haha"
[7:20:40] <%Monkeyweed21> I could go for Dragon Type Communism
[7:20:43] <ingman112> Imagine these two in charge of the Union
[7:20:48] <+ju_ten> 😬
[7:20:50] <%VyperVic> working class people are too busy working to read das kapital
[7:20:51] <derap41> TOPICAL
[7:20:51] <%illusiveSaint> i mean Marx was a notorious moocher
[7:20:51] <+StatesmanPrimal> at this point we have all met the same person and they just dress up in different outfits
[7:20:52] <fedemachado96> hi im a poor dirt commie haha
[7:20:53] <%SilvaChariot0133> "How many layers of Communism are you on Claire?"
[7:20:54] <NeutrinoInteraction> I've met a ton of leftists that are lower-middle-class to poor. I've only met full-blown COMMUNISTS that are upper-middle-class.
[7:20:54] <ingman112> Evrart would eat them alive
[7:20:58] <derap41> MEGA YIKES
[7:21:03] <%athuramn> that's the look of agreement on pats face
[7:21:05] <%TIME_PUNCHER> Crime never existed before capitalism duh
[7:21:06] <+trackles_64> financial crime
[7:21:07] <YumAntimatter> dog snoring is adorable
[7:21:13] <+JustToWatch> that one is definitely a you thing Pat, I know plenty of dirt poor communists
[7:21:17] <PartyFavors> @NeutrinoInteraction Yeahhhh, that's about right
[7:21:18] <dds333a> It's parody, but it comes literally from the kind of thought you'd expect from uni students
[7:21:18] <%SilvaChariot0133> LUL
[7:21:23] <+Daedalus119> yeah all my leftist friends are pretty damn downtrodden
[7:21:25] <%jorniev> WHAT ABOUT CRIME SYNDICATES...
[7:21:30] <+CammerTime21> GUN
[7:21:31] <%GarbageNirvana> Look, kids! A GUN
[7:21:34] <%JusTTheGuyYouNeed> most crimes are crimes of passion, so
[7:21:36] <akitanito> "nearly to a man"?
[7:21:43] <+StatesmanPrimal> obviously crime didn't exist before the advent of the free market Kappa
[7:21:46] <+xTJPBQdfNHA7qUxeTd5Uy9gV> hey kids do you want to play with my gun
[7:21:47] <%athuramn> no
[7:21:49] <derap41> ITs busted
[7:21:50] <%Uselesswhitenoise> yeah yeah yeah
[7:21:52] <+SammyOVision> Time to RADICALISE THESE YOUTHS TO ACTION
[7:21:53] <akitanito> there's no ammo
[7:21:54] <aiutare47> no ammo right
[7:21:54] <ingman112> Steban's less triggerhappy than his buddy
[7:21:55] <+emperri> It's broken
[7:21:56] <chippybippers> it's inoperable
[7:21:56] <pi_in_the_sci> GIVE HIM GUN
[7:21:57] <%illusiveSaint> appease to their fetish LUL
[7:21:57] <%bevyrage> you already had the gun identified
[7:21:59] <+emperri> You know it's broken
[7:22:00] <heartlesshealer> Is it loaded?
[7:22:01] <+RushUnplugged> now THAT's a thing that's all about these types, calling the people that ACTUALLY fought and got killed "communards" because they failed
[7:22:05] <Explodincatz> 1
[7:22:08] <DSD24> "You are gonna carry that weight"
[7:22:12] <Press_X_ToJASON> Kim's looking at these MFs, silently, thinking to himself that his moralist days weren't so embarrassing after all LUL
[7:22:15] <derap41> Glorious AK
[7:22:17] <dds333a> Oh boy
[7:22:19] <heartlesshealer> Communist Phylactery
[7:22:23] <+StatesmanPrimal> imagine communists actually rising up
[7:22:24] <%dork_doggler> @RushUnplugged "communard" is a neutral term in this universe, apparently
[7:22:28] <ingman112> I would love to see hippie moralist teenage Kim
[7:22:29] <Alfred_Waaghur> @heartlesshealer It's old and inoperable
[7:22:32] <+lukausedsteal> @derap41 oh my god thats literally it
[7:22:49] <+StatesmanPrimal> @heartlesshealer that breaks me pretty hard
[7:22:51] <heartlesshealer> @Alfred_Waaghur thanks, I wasn't here when pat had it identified
[7:22:52] <derap41> These Writers know their stuff
[7:22:54] <+projectmanatees> break their egos
[7:22:59] <akitanito> crush em beneath your feet
[7:23:01] <%GarbageNirvana> I mean AKs are pretty neat
[7:23:08] <%GarbageNirvana> Pieces of shit in a lot of circumstances but still neat
[7:23:09] <NeutrinoInteraction> I love that the narrative is just like "These guys are just FUCKING NERDS, actually"
[7:23:12] <Profmcstevie> Brain BIG
[7:23:16] <aiutare47> AKs are great
[7:23:17] <+RushUnplugged> @RushUnplugged -nard words seem to be pejorative,even if mildly
[7:23:21] <derap41> They're also a symbol of the revolution
[7:23:29] <+tigerfang86> they're doing their best, even if they're massive dorks
[7:23:32] <+trackles_64> we have to do homework
[7:23:38] <ingman112> ExACtly
[7:23:40] <+lukausedsteal> there is an immense amount of reverence for the AK
[7:23:41] <%OfficioPrefectusCorgi> Your not
[7:23:45] <dds333a> @garbagenirvana Sam L. was unfortunately not entirely correct.
[7:23:49] <+trackles_64> we only wan tyintellectuals
[7:23:50] <twohitgood> a people's revolution requires "the people"
[7:23:51] <%SirGO0SE> LUL
[7:23:51] <NeutrinoInteraction> No EVERYONE who is a communist is SMART and we will ENSURE THIS
[7:23:54] <%Urgotfantasy> but theyre not trying to organize an uprising, just theorize it
[7:23:54] <+StatesmanPrimal> can we have a metal gear be the symbol of the uprising
[7:23:56] <heartlesshealer> Designed to fail
[7:24:03] <PartyFavors> They're philosophers, not ACTUAL revolutionaries
[7:24:04] <Blank9> it's not the uprising, it's the INTELLECTUAL VANGUARD
[7:24:06] <+ReallyBigRocks> You must be an intellectual to be a part of the working class revolution
[7:24:07] <+mczarklesby> WE can't just let ANYONE into the mass uprising! Then it might be like, full of regular people.
[7:24:11] <aiutare47> You must be bourgoise
[7:24:16] <%illusiveSaint> you need to screen them Pat!
[7:24:19] <%Uselesswhitenoise> yeah yeah

[7:24:26] <%DiscoMatador> Based
[7:24:28] <+Daedalus119> nah these guys aren't running a populist group
[7:24:30] <Profmcstevie> We need fury
[7:24:31] <%Nobrev> EAT THE RICH
[7:24:32] <Press_X_ToJASON> it's like trying to build a third political party when that party needs 5% of a vote for their candidate for the top office for that candidate to even qualify to debate LUL
[7:24:34] <aiutare47> Commie but only for middle class white folks
[7:24:36] <mass1997> Kinda raw
[7:24:41] <+vicar_anat> oh look its eat-the-rich-o'clock
[7:24:47] <+StatesmanPrimal> then we'll just all rise up as one it's simple
[7:24:49] <%TIME_PUNCHER> "I'M OPPRESSED! YEET"
[7:24:49] <heartlesshealer> anything below French Revolution is not gonna cut it

[7:24:57] <+ReallyBigRocks> get composed
[7:24:58] <%jorniev> like completely shuting down society at a minimum
[7:25:01] <+lukausedsteal> god modern day philosophers suck shit

[7:26:14] <PartyFavors> Also, put on your clothes
[7:26:18] <%GarbageNirvana> ...also I wonder if wearing the white jacket gives you a bonus
[7:26:22] <marcomatame> So, uh, how do you keep politics out of this game?

[7:31:33] <+mental_mashup> Anxiety locked you out of communism
[7:31:54] <NeutrinoInteraction> @mental_mashup In my experience, those two things go hand-in-hand
[7:32:03] <marcomatame> Sometimes I lament being the opposite of a bookworm, but these guys make me feel better about it.

[7:37:18] <+icekept> HK is amazing
[7:37:19] <+mental_mashup> I’m thankful for having a late night stream to watch while I grand magnamlo orbs

[7:39:12] <heartlesshealer> 72...
[7:39:12] <+The_Yottabyte> is this a game that by the point you're at encourages save-scumming as sort of a way to clear the goblins?

[7:40:23] <%Monkeyweed21> @PatStaresAt dont forget your composure pants
[7:40:28] <ingman112> People who claim to be the "champions of their race" always turn out to be the worst examples of their species
[7:40:36] <ingman112> Our species, that is
[7:40:37] <+mental_mashup> Hypothetically speaking if every time we touched, we could hypothetically swear we can fly

[7:42:06] <%TIME_PUNCHER> you'd think it'd be real fucken easy to see these flaming rhinos
[7:42:08] <+mental_mashup> A flaming rhino of a very specific color
[7:42:21] <+StatesmanPrimal> ah yes Kabal
[7:42:24] <aiutare47> The NWO
[7:42:31] <%OfficioPrefectusCorgi> Working with the Gays
[7:42:35] <derap41> Its never My failure
[7:42:36] <%dork_doggler> you know exaclty who they mean, Pat
[7:42:37] <NeekoElysium> (((them)))
[7:42:41] <%Mucmaster> The GLOBALISTS
[7:42:42] <heartlesshealer> yeah, they're all conspiracy shitheads in one way or another
[7:42:43] <%jorniev> they feel so out of control
[7:42:44] <%Monkeyweed21> THE UNDERGROUND
[7:42:49] <%TIME_PUNCHER> beware of (((the multi-brackets people)))
[7:42:49] <akitanito> what do you mean you don't believe the lizardmen
[7:42:51] <%Broken_Sonex> @aiutare47 FO-FO-FOR LIFE
[7:42:55] <+mental_mashup> What if you actually find a flaming rhino though and Harry just forgot about them
[7:42:55] <ASpiffyGoat> they like to project. a lot.
[7:42:57] <ingman112> Oh you'd LOVE the fascist vision quest
[7:42:59] <magboost> Its the Projection
[7:42:59] <%illusiveSaint> it's all based on paranoia or self reflection
[7:43:00] <ammobasket> And I’m not in the group GD it
[7:43:00] <NeutrinoInteraction> Yes, it's called projection
[7:43:01] <Slimeking_Mike> They're all just. Roleplaying.
[7:43:02] <+Ghufufin> projection is key
[7:43:06] <akitanito> it's projection all the way down
[7:43:07] <%athuramn> you just described people in a nutshell
[7:43:08] <derap41> Projecting like a old timey movie
[7:43:09] <SixthShinx> IMAX PROJECTION
[7:43:10] <dds333a> "I'm telling you, if we went back to those times, I'd be a noble".
[7:43:12] <Profmcstevie> I'm doing it, so it's what everyone does....cos I'm normal :)
[7:43:16] <saraizarai> I assumed its just because they have no power and justify that whatever way
[7:43:18] <%dork_doggler> @TIME_PUNCHER honestly can't believe Twitch doesn't ban triple parentheses
[7:43:19] <+The_Yottabyte> Bruh: "All other races are inferior" same Bruh: "All other races control everything"
[7:43:22] <%Maids4lyfe> accuse your enemy of the shit you're doing
[7:43:23] <+mental_mashup> The underground liberal media is gonna make boys into girls and girls into boys
[7:43:26] <+The_Yottabyte> doesnt sound inferior to me
[7:43:27] <leinadtonu> it's only logical
[7:43:29] <+StatesmanPrimal> I wish I was in a secret society that practiced unbiased transhumanism apriSadge
[7:43:30] <derap41> When we become a minority well be mistreated Like I mistreat minorites
[7:43:43] <+mental_mashup> We live in a society
[7:43:45] <+Mrbaconator> COMPOSER
[7:43:46] <%Maids4lyfe> lol
[7:43:49] <ingman112> DIe
[7:43:53] <jin_kazamaru> They can't believe that they are in their position in life, refusing to accept the unfair reality we live in, they instead believe there is a force against him
[7:43:54] <dreamfillah> D I E
[7:43:55] <Slimeking_Mike> DIE
[7:43:58] <Blank9> the failure is hilarious for this
[7:43:59] <Yakobro> SWOLE

[7:44:16] <+lukausedsteal> shoot him
[7:44:17] <NeroInfinite> GET HIM
[7:44:20] <+StatesmanPrimal> I wholeheartedly accept the ruthless nature of the universe
[7:44:21] <%Monkeyweed21> HE IS WEARING IT
[7:44:31] <%SilvaChariot0133> oh were you now
[7:44:31] <DianaTheAscian> sure you are
[7:44:33] <+SammyOVision> get his ass
[7:44:42] <DianaTheAscian> wait what?
[7:44:43] <heartlesshealer> SHAME? REAL????
[7:44:44] <+Riecharus> See this is the weird part, he is totally sincere

[7:44:55] <%LordSDB> YE GET HIM KIM!
[7:44:56] <heartlesshealer> yeah that's super weird
[7:44:57] <NeutrinoInteraction> "Listen, if minorities get power they will violently subject us, so the only thing to do is violently subject them so they don't do that"
[7:44:57] <ingman112> 2 down
[7:44:59] <%bassoontyphoon> yes kim
[7:45:02] <%athuramn> you can be a sincere racist @Riecharus
[7:45:03] <+Mrbaconator> what kidn of MONSTER would wear armor worn by a hanged corpse i mean REALLY Kappa
[7:45:04] <%jorniev> HELL YEAH
[7:45:15] <%bevyrage> so before the director's cut update you only had ONE means to get the armor from him, and it was super specific
[7:45:17] <Savage_Howitzer> psaJpeg
[7:45:19] <SixthShinx> WutFace eww, his sweat
[7:45:22] <dds333a> Hey, it's Lena's boy Kappa
[7:45:24] <%Maids4lyfe> @Mrbaconator LUL
[7:45:25] <Alfred_Waaghur> The guy loves authority. Lying to police is therefore shameful.
[7:45:31] <+tigerfang86> EVERYONE ELSE WAS DOING IT
[7:45:33] <+tigerfang86> SO I HAD TO
[7:45:41] <+Riecharus> This guy just can't stop
[7:45:44] <moonmeh> wow
[7:45:45] <%Maids4lyfe> the sweat is like armor lube
[7:45:45] <jin_kazamaru> I believe the shame here is because he didn't want to look weak for stealing armor from a dead man, and probably not guilty about doing it
[7:45:51] <ingman112> Older people tend to ignore the "quirks" of their longtime friends
[7:45:53] <heartlesshealer> ooooh fuck this guy
[7:45:54] <YumAntimatter> plus he was *foreign*
[7:45:55] <%athuramn> @bevyrage is it spoiler to mention how?
[7:46:16] <aiutare47> YEYEYEYE
[7:46:17] <+StatesmanPrimal> oh no, not the everyone else was doing it excuse

[7:46:24] <%DiscoMatador> yep
[7:46:25] <%athuramn> fucking "about" or "a boot"
[7:46:27] <+emperri> How did he get body armor off a body that was hanging from a tree
[7:46:31] <%bevyrage> nah you basically had to hold onto the mug until after you did the composure check. if you fined him or showed him the mug prior you wouldn't have leverage
[7:46:32] <%illusiveSaint> hasBoot
[7:46:33] <Sol_Install> CYRPTOFASCIST!?
[7:46:35] <%bassoontyphoon> please tread on me daddy

[7:47:16] <%linSP> ULTRA INSTINCT
[7:47:26] <marcomatame> wow this guy WILL lick your boots, even if you refuse
[7:47:27] <%bassoontyphoon> He sounds like a mix between squidward and ben shapiro
[7:47:28] <+mental_mashup> Turn it off? That IS his personality
[7:47:32] <jin_kazamaru> So his conservative nature out weights his racism
[7:47:34] <YumAntimatter> @ingman112 probably sell it
[7:47:43] <derap41> He thinks you're shutting him up for the Union LUL
[7:47:50] <ingman112> Yeah but then why wear it? What a weirdo
[7:47:51] <Blank9> Want to know what you say is the clinking noise if you fail the composure check?
[7:47:52] <+mental_mashup> Let me pick your boots or I will take them by force
[7:47:57] <derap41> I mean you effectivly are

[7:48:29] <ingman112> It's a shirt
[7:48:31] <NeroInfinite> Now find the rest of it
[7:48:31] <+JustToWatch> the coolest thing is that it's a shirt not a jacket
[7:48:32] <YumAntimatter> the tie just pulls this outfit together
[7:48:39] <%Dr_DangerPhD> If you hadn't cleaned your armor boots in the soup pot I'm sure this guy would've been happy to lick them clean
[7:48:46] <ingman112> Yessir
[7:48:49] <+mental_mashup> Business cyborg man
[7:48:51] <+emperri> it's nonsense future armor
[7:48:52] <penitentpendant> He wore it under his jacket, so it makes sense
[7:48:53] <%dork_doggler> wear the shivers coat
[7:48:55] <derap41> Looking like a killer
[7:48:56] <%bevyrage> yup!

[7:49:17] <penitentpendant> 4 in total
[7:49:17] <dds333a> One step closer to Q

[7:49:18] <ingman112> 4 pieces total
[7:49:19] <%bevyrage> 2 more pieces

[7:49:23] <jin_kazamaru> I mean he was wearing it under his clothing, but yeah more like a bulletproof vest than power armor
[7:49:23] <%dork_doggler> Ask Cuno
[7:49:23] <+emperri> there's also a helmet
[7:49:25] <leinadtonu> 2 more
[7:49:25] <%Mucmaster> Pants too
[7:49:26] <%bassoontyphoon> 4 in total

[7:49:33] <pi_in_the_sci> arms and helmet

[7:49:34] <Press_X_ToJASON> you can still get them, I think
[7:49:34] <%dork_doggler> Missed one, kinda, other isn't available yet
[7:49:35] <derap41> You've passed one but haven't missed it
[7:49:36] <%bevyrage> you can find the gloves when the day shifts over
[7:49:36] <%linSP> you passed the gloves at one point
[7:49:36] <digaogrunge> and hat
[7:49:36] <%Uselesswhitenoise> ones endgame i think?
[7:49:37] <aiutare47> Full set Pat
[7:49:37] <ingman112> No pants
[7:49:38] <YumAntimatter> what do you know about the arms
[7:49:39] <+justianxix> just talk to more people
[7:49:40] <NeroInfinite> You'll get 'em later
[7:49:42] <%SilvaChariot0133> no pants
[7:49:42] <%dork_doggler> There's no fucking pants
[7:49:42] <+Bouerd> There aren't pants
[7:49:44] <+StatesmanPrimal> I should go to sleep before my mind breaks
[7:49:44] <+icekept> missed
[7:49:44] <%jorniev> gloves are with a little girl helmet is later
[7:49:45] <aiutare47> Full set
[7:49:45] <YumAntimatter> there are no pants
[7:49:46] <GeneralOrangutan> theres no pants
[7:49:47] <patrioticwang> You look like you have toilet paper stuck to you
[7:49:49] <@StridentSong> There are two pieces left: Gloves and Helmet
[7:49:49] <ingman112> You'll get to em
[7:49:51] <%Broken_Sonex> Harry was wearing the gloves in the cover art.
[7:49:51] <derap41> They're not gone you can still get them
[7:49:53] <%linSP> you can still get them later
[7:49:54] <+xTJPBQdfNHA7qUxeTd5Uy9gV> there are no pants
[7:49:54] <heartlesshealer> missed one, but sounds like it's not gone forever
[7:49:54] <GeneralOrangutan> just talk to people
[7:49:55] <digaogrunge> no pants
[7:49:55] <Blank9> I think the only one you can miss "permanently" is the shoes
[7:49:55] <moonmeh> nothing is perma missed right now
[7:49:56] <%gelatinous_cube> don't worry about helmet
[7:49:57] <%Sveargieth> Check tasts
[7:49:57] <%Maids4lyfe> YOU HAVE THE PANTS
[7:49:58] <%bevyrage> pants went missing and you'll never find them
[7:50:00] <moonmeh> its fine
[7:50:02] <Slimeking_Mike> Chat's being confusing, wait for us to calm down
[7:50:03] <%Sveargieth> Tasks***
[7:50:04] <%dork_doggler> Want us to just tell you how to get gloves
[7:50:05] <ingman112> Just keep it going for now
[7:50:06] <derap41> Cuno told you
[7:50:08] <penitentpendant> Gloves, Boots, Helmet, Chest. Your character even asks why there's no pants when you take up the task.
[7:50:10] <%dork_doggler> Talk to Cuno
[7:50:10] <+justianxix> talk to more people at the fishing village
[7:50:11] <moonmeh> yeah i missed the boots early on in my first run
[7:50:16] <%Maids4lyfe> hands
[7:50:16] <@StridentSong> Cuno is where you talk about the gloves
[7:50:19] <twohitgood> boots gauntlets chestplate helmet
[7:50:19] <heartlesshealer> Cuno
[7:50:20] <DianaTheAscian> @PatStaresAt u fucked cuno
[7:50:23] <%Maids4lyfe> but you can find it
[7:50:24] <Press_X_ToJASON> yeah, he told you about the helmet
[7:50:26] <vilecrois> Cindy tolf you about the glvoes
[7:50:28] <%dork_doggler> Talk to the girl in the house in the village
[7:50:29] <@StridentSong> Oh
[7:50:29] <leinadtonu> There's only 4 pieces of the armor
[7:50:33] <%illusiveSaint> cuno talks about the helmet which you can get later
[7:50:33] <moonmeh> there's more people at the fishing village you can talk about
[7:50:34] <%Monkeyweed21> Cuno can tell you
[7:50:34] <@StridentSong> Then you lost the gloves
[7:50:38] <%Maids4lyfe> The helmet is washed out to sea
[7:50:38] <@StridentSong> If you fucked over Cuno, you can't get them
[7:50:41] <%jorniev> FISHING VILLAGE
[7:50:44] <Alfred_Waaghur> Maybe the kids will help with the glove
[7:50:48] <+justianxix> try talking to all of them
[7:50:48] <NeroInfinite> ye
[7:50:52] <aiutare47> Im not sure thats true
[7:50:53] <YumAntimatter> i don't think cindy told him guys
[7:50:57] <derap41> Still think you can
[7:50:57] <aiutare47> I got them without Cuno
[7:51:04] <%illusiveSaint> you don't need cuno to get the helmet
[7:51:05] <ingman112> If he can get em we'll get to it
[7:51:05] <+JustToWatch> I don't think that's true
[7:51:06] <hippofant> Chat, stop yelling where the gloves are. He can't just jump to them. He has to follow the chain.
[7:51:07] <%gelatinous_cube> cuno has nothing to do with getting them
[7:51:08] <Slimeking_Mike> I'm sure Cindy's the Gloves quest marker
[7:51:09] <%bevyrage> fishing village for gloves, helmet is gonna come up eventually don't worry about it
[7:51:09] <+Soliloquy123> Oh, what happened to Cuno?
[7:51:09] <%linSP> the kid where you found the replacement bird tells you where the gloves are
[7:51:11] <aiutare47> Im pretty sure
[7:51:12] <ingman112> If not we can't do anything about it now
[7:51:13] <DianaTheAscian> @PatStaresAt that was the ominous feeling I'm guessing
[7:51:13] <+xTJPBQdfNHA7qUxeTd5Uy9gV> people are dangerously close to just spoiling what / where to get armor pieces
[7:51:17] <Blank9> I only found the gloves my first time through
[7:51:19] <%Broken_Sonex> @aiutare47 How?
[7:51:20] <Press_X_ToJASON> cuno is helmet advice, gloves are somewhere else
[7:51:21] <%Maids4lyfe> you don't need cuno, no one needs cuno cuno don't need cuno
[7:51:21] <+emperri> I don't think Cuno has anything to do with it but the gloves aren't amazing anyway
[7:51:22] <Slimeking_Mike> Cuno's irrelevant
[7:51:28] <%TIME_PUNCHER> G'day mate
[7:51:28] <heartlesshealer> I think you just need Cuno to know where they *are*
[7:51:30] <+justianxix> some one JUST DID
[7:51:34] <%dork_doggler> @PatStaresAt the little girl in the fihing village cabin should tell you
[7:51:39] <%linSP> cuno doesnt fuckin care!
[7:51:40] <Alfred_Waaghur> Fuck the Cuno
[7:51:40] <Press_X_ToJASON> @heartlesshealer this is correct
[7:51:41] <GeneralOrangutan> the gloves are great though
[7:51:47] <Blank9> fuck's cuno care
[7:51:50] <aiutare47> @Broken_Sonex Im trying to remember it was like two years ago
[7:51:58] <derap41> 70 XP who
[7:52:02] <+emperri> hey chat lawyers he's literally asking where the pieces are
[7:52:04] <hippofant> What's amazing is all the people spoiling the armor locations aren't even helping, because it doesn't help to just tell Pat where they are.
[7:52:06] <+emperri> chill
[7:52:12] <%king_wragles> What're the gloves called?
[7:52:28] <Overloard> ive only watched woolie, did this playthrough have pat smacken cuno in the gob?
[7:52:36] <+emperri> @king_wragles t-500 gauntlets
[7:52:43] <ingman112> Chat's jumping in trying to be helpful but it's obfuscating how to get them. It'll come up naturally or not at all
[7:52:47] <%illusiveSaint> talk to cindy about the gloves
[7:52:49] <aiutare47> @Overloard he failed and made a fool of himself
[7:52:54] <ingman112> So everybody chill
[7:53:08] <NeroInfinite> @PatStaresAt YOu're not locke dout of the gloves, you're locked out of the hlmet.
[7:53:17] <Overloard> @Overloard oof LUL
[7:53:17] <@StridentSong> It's Cindy, I just checked
[7:53:26] <+trackles_64> yeah pat, patience
[7:53:31] <%JusTTheGuyYouNeed> Cindy is the one for the gloves
[7:53:34] <@StridentSong> And yea, Cuno is involved with the Helmet
[7:53:46] <%dork_doggler> @NeroInfinite I think he gets the helmet either way
[7:53:49] <%illusiveSaint> @neroinfinite that's not true you don't need cuno he kicked it in the ocean
[7:53:49] <%king_wragles> Looks like Cuno just speeds up getting the helmet
[7:54:03] <NeroInfinite> Ah.
[7:54:03] <%king_wragles> As the investigation progresses, Pa has a chance of finding the helmet on his own
[7:54:04] <+emperri> The helmet is where it is regardless of whether Cuno tells you about it
[7:54:13] <%linSP> freddy phasmid?
[7:54:13] <Slimeking_Mike> Yea in simple terms Cindy = Gloves, Cuno =/= Helmet
[7:54:22] <%Broken_Sonex> But you can get the helmet without Cuno, apparently. I don't know.
[7:54:22] <Blank9> god who cares
[7:54:24] <%Urgotfantasy> This guys encyclopedia is high
[7:54:51] <derap41> or ...Camo?
[7:54:57] <%Uselesswhitenoise> sounds sick as hell
[7:55:26] <+JustToWatch> so it has the nen power of the chameleon chimera ant
[7:55:48] <%Urgotfantasy> based, bugs are sick
[7:56:06] <Slimeking_Mike> Phaaahsmid
[7:56:23] <derap41> not second hand accounts?
[7:56:33] <+emperri> I like this guy's Steve Irwin impression
[7:56:55] <+lukausedsteal> hey pat might, these guys are kinda important npcs and you should do their quests
[7:57:00] <jin_kazamaru> Fun choice given his 'job'
[7:57:03] <derap41> ...Crab man?
[7:57:07] <%Divryne> Holy shit are we still going after 8 hours?
[7:57:16] <ingman112> @lukausedsteal Chill. Like he's not gonna do em
[7:57:18] <+Daedalus119> a couple of teenagers? Like cuno and the other one?
[7:57:20] <%dork_doggler> @lukausedsteal i think Pat is going to do *every* sidequest
[7:57:21] <+StatesmanPrimal> i bet this guy can't even work a dna sequencer
[7:57:35] <%dork_doggler> @Daedalus119 I think they're twelve and ten
[7:57:45] <derap41> Most Aphids do that
[7:57:46] <magboost> @StatesmanPrimal I mean most people cant
[7:57:49] <%jorniev> HEAR THAT CHRIS
[7:57:52] <+StatesmanPrimal> thank you encyclopedia
[7:57:57] <ingman112> "PHAEEEA-SMID"
[7:58:00] <saraizarai> phaaaaaaasmid
[7:58:08] <+StatesmanPrimal> hey man, he professes to be a biologist
[7:58:09] <%dork_doggler> @StatesmanPrimal I bet DNA sequencer don't exist in this universe. I bet DNA just a theory. Schizo tech.
[7:58:12] <dds333a> Cuno's more like a child
[7:58:14] <heartlesshealer> parthenogenesis is pretty cool among egg-birthed creatures
[7:58:27] <+StatesmanPrimal> dangit you might be onto something
[7:58:39] <+StatesmanPrimal> at least we have our mass spectrometer
[7:58:39] <%dork_doggler> @heartlesshealer too bad epidemic fucks clonal species up so bad
[7:58:49] <+lukausedsteal> Morell is a good dude.
[7:58:55] <+lukausedsteal> Just likes his bugs
[7:58:56] <heartlesshealer> yeah, it does
[7:59:02] <derap41> This World is in the 60-70s culturally but slower technologically in some places
[7:59:14] <heartlesshealer> parthenogenesis is mostly for hard times that -aren't- a plague
[7:59:16] <derap41> like pepper boxes with cased bullets
[7:59:21] <+StatesmanPrimal> @dork_doggler tbf they can have adaptations to mitigate such a scenario
[7:59:43] <%dork_doggler> @derap41 and hyper-advanced in others. we don't have t-500 armor by a long shot, and how rdiocomputers seem to work is extremely sophisticates
[8:00:04] <%jorniev> MAH WAIF
[8:00:05] <ingman112> It's raining too, the dude's gonna get sick
[8:00:24] <derap41> @dork_doggler Radio computer is just radio with specialist operators but the ceramic armor is impressive
[8:00:49] <+StatesmanPrimal> also to be completely fair, carnivorous stick insects is completely plausible, as long as there was a niche they could fill and there was a need it is entirely likely it could happen
[8:00:50] <%dork_doggler> @derap41 you idn't get the explanation from Sonja? shit's wacky, it's not what you think
[8:01:00] <primarch_lupercal> wait what 8 hour stream
[8:01:14] <+xTJPBQdfNHA7qUxeTd5Uy9gV> @derap41 not quite -- it's this version of cloud computing, plus some stuff related to "computation in physical space" that's only hinted at
[8:01:19] <derap41> Isn't it just operators taking orders and handing data
[8:01:30] <candidateplays> @derap41 No the radiocomputers work in a way that is completely impossible in real life.
[8:01:36] <derap41> like live operators
[8:01:36] <+StatesmanPrimal> oh no my urge to use my education is taking over NotLikeThis
[8:01:47] <%dork_doggler> @derap41 computations happen through radio interaction in-air
[8:01:50] <%illusiveSaint> @derap41 it's a different kind of tech not based irl
[8:01:56] <penitentpendant> Kim: Internal Sigh
[8:02:00] <+lukausedsteal> no kim
[8:02:02] <%SirGO0SE> psaLiz
[8:02:07] <+lukausedsteal> i like BUGS now not MEN
[8:02:07] <DianaTheAscian> shouldn't you change days now?
[8:02:21] <ingman112> Soon
[8:02:31] <%dork_doggler> @DianaTheAscian no need as long as quests still tick
[8:02:42] <DianaTheAscian> k
[8:02:47] <+StatesmanPrimal> did someone say BUGS
[8:03:04] <+StatesmanPrimal> please i need work, i'm an aspiring entomologist
[8:03:10] <ingman112> Too proud
[8:03:13] <derap41> @dork_doggler I thought that was just that they used the radio to communicate with a computer (old style) that talked back or performed actions given by they user
[8:03:26] <+SammyOVision> thick
[8:03:27] <%dork_doggler> SLATHER THICK
[8:03:28] <penitentpendant> Armpits!
[8:03:31] <+emperri> LAY IT THICC
[8:03:33] <+Daedalus119> oh man oh man go thick
[8:03:36] <leinadtonu> 2
[8:03:36] <GeneralOrangutan> get all up in there with pheromones
[8:03:37] <+StatesmanPrimal> lay it on THICK
[8:03:40] <Blank9> you smell like shit anyway
[8:03:41] <derap41> Musky
[8:03:46] <leinadtonu> good
[8:03:47] <tanarath> BUG MUSK
[8:03:54] <jin_kazamaru> Isn't 2.00 am the limit tho?
[8:03:58] <ingman112> 50 REAL
[8:04:10] <ingman112> Nah no time limit. Just almost everyone is asleep at 2
[8:04:10] <+StatesmanPrimal> bug musk apriPog
[8:04:16] <+lukausedsteal> bug musk
[8:04:17] <%dork_doggler> @derap41 It seems to work by somehow using the interaction between radio waves fronts as a CPU
[8:04:31] <+lukausedsteal> uwu musky buggy
[8:04:36] <Blank9> time just stops moving at 2am
[8:04:38] <%bassoontyphoon> RETURN TO BUG ISLAND
[8:04:42] <+emperri> At 2 AM time stops advancing, but you can keep doing whatever you have access to. All NPCs but Joyce will be asleep though
[8:04:47] <DianaTheAscian> man the youtube vod is gonna be insane
[8:04:50] <magboost> Did Pat sing the song?
[8:04:53] <%brewelfen> RETURN TO BUG ISLAND
[8:04:57] <ASpiffyGoat> its very nice that the game makes it very clear who you can talk to again and who you cannot
[8:04:58] <%dork_doggler> @jin_kazamaru 2 am is when most npc's disappear, but not all. I completed the entire church quest at 2 am
[8:04:58] <DianaTheAscian> yes
[8:04:58] <+emperri> He did
[8:04:59] <%king_wragles> yep
[8:05:02] <derap41> I mean you can digitize a signal not sure it work with radiowaves though
[8:05:07] <+StatesmanPrimal> dang, this man is earning my respect
[8:05:51] <+StatesmanPrimal> i actually do respect cryptozoology as long as they still follow the scientific method and have some training
[8:05:55] <leinadtonu> yep
[8:05:55] <%dork_doggler> @derap41 dude this is a universe where math breaks down once you get too far from islands of stability
[8:06:24] <Blank9> god the pale is fuck
[8:06:28] <+lukausedsteal> to be fair, there is like a giant entropic mist thats eating all of reality
[8:06:40] <Blank9> what a cool setting
[8:06:52] <leinadtonu> Guys does Pat know about it?
[8:06:57] <+StatesmanPrimal> in search of the fantastic is an admirable thing, science is about the search for the unknown
[8:07:03] <ingman112> He knows about the Pale
[8:07:05] <ingman112> He's talked to Joyce
[8:07:07] <aiutare47> @leinadtonu He does
[8:07:09] <dd44dostivei> this voice kinda sucks though
[8:07:10] <jin_kazamaru> I mean it's good to have passion in any field, even if it's finding big foot, as long as you take the approach as less of a fanatic, and more of a true researcher
[8:07:14] <leinadtonu> k
[8:07:24] <leinadtonu> Shit's scary
[8:07:28] <+mczarklesby> First time play through.
[8:07:29] <SirCacaPee> Hello Pat
[8:07:35] <%illusiveSaint> @derap41 the world is flat in this game suspend your disbelief that radiowaves are super wifi
[8:07:38] <+JustToWatch> @ignorum he knows about the pale, not anything else
[8:07:51] <ingman112> The boring ones are the real ones, of course
[8:08:12] <+StatesmanPrimal> exactly, as long as they follow the method like this guy it's entirely respectable
[8:08:13] <Slimeking_Mike> 50% Fake, 0.0005% Real
[8:08:32] <%jorniev> giant squids were real
[8:08:36] <derap41> @illusiveSaint Its not that I apply our physical laws to this game I just thought the radio computer worked with operators and switchers
[8:08:54] <Alfred_Waaghur> Hissing..?
[8:08:54] <+luftraumm1> is there a discipline in biology that looks for extra rare species?
[8:08:59] <Slimeking_Mike> Wait, 0.05 i mean. still
[8:09:01] <%jorniev> going for 8 hours now
[8:09:10] <%stungunheadbutt47> stungunheadbutt47 subscribed at Tier 1. 
[8:09:19] <ingman112> ENTS
[8:09:20] <%stungunheadbutt47> Hope you’re doing ok
[8:09:24] <+emperri> ents
[8:09:29] <ingman112> PAPER ENTS
[8:09:30] <+StatesmanPrimal> not as far as i know, it's usually just zoology
[8:09:33] <+lukausedsteal> ENTS FUCK YEAH
[8:09:44] <+StatesmanPrimal> yo ents hype
[8:09:44] <dds333a> We got tree people
[8:09:47] <jin_kazamaru> I played this quest out mostly silent, as I had Kim watching and didn't want to look crazy, but also didn't want to disrespect Morell's work
[8:10:23] <ingman112> This...might not have been real
[8:10:34] <+emperri> wasn't Lavender Shadow the name of Arnold's go-kart
[8:10:36] <dds333a> Sounds about right
[8:10:42] <ingman112> But he's his own harshest critic, which says a lot
[8:11:01] <%MisterRockett> Pat wtf how are you still going?
[8:11:10] <%OfficioPrefectusCorgi> Ooohh
[8:11:11] <+emperri> google says it was the mauve avenger. rip
[8:11:14] <penitentpendant> He's harsher on his owns eyes than his wife's
[8:11:17] <%dork_doggler> based
[8:11:19] <T_Sasquatch> damn , he is still streaming LUL
[8:11:25] <dds333a> course it is
[8:11:25] <leinadtonu> Communism fuels Pat
[8:11:29] <ingman112> MINE is real though
[8:11:59] <+StatesmanPrimal> the fact that he's very critical towards himself is very telling though
[8:12:01] <jin_kazamaru> Good outlook for a researcher, attempt to disprove your own theory until it's so impossible to do so that it can more easily be considered fact
[8:12:01] <+lukausedsteal> well at least he's honest
[8:12:11] <ingman112> Nice way to frame failures too though
[8:12:12] <Canadian_Suit> Did Pat get the armor piece?
[8:12:18] <%sahykikserpent14> wait, has pat been playing for 8 hours?
[8:12:21] <ingman112> Yep
[8:12:24] <bettysharkface> So, mythbusters, but cryptids.
[8:12:25] <+luftraumm1> what about the col de mamadaqua?
[8:12:31] <%illusiveSaint> i like what this guy saying why not make life more interesting?
[8:12:34] <dds333a> @canadian_suit ye
[8:12:37] <%sahykikserpent14> fuck, i fell asleep as it started
[8:12:45] <Canadian_Suit> ok ok
[8:12:53] <+StatesmanPrimal> see the fact that his goal is to disprove himself until he no longer can realistically shows that he's the real deal
[8:12:54] <%dork_doggler> @sahykikserpent14 you been asleep for eight hours?
[8:13:01] <%dork_doggler> Joyce time!
[8:13:03] <ingman112> Joyce, book, bed?
[8:13:09] <%sahykikserpent14> stream starts at 2am for me
[8:13:27] <%illusiveSaint> do the traps rn for morell
[8:13:33] <+luftraumm1> I really love these long streams
[8:13:38] <%king_wragles> Do you want a catch up or are you just gonna watch the vod, @sah?
[8:13:44] <%dork_doggler> @PatStaresAt you failed the passive
[8:13:46] <dds333a> Clearly not
[8:13:47] <+StatesmanPrimal> i need to watch the vod from the beginning also
[8:13:49] <derap41> old people do sleep less
[8:13:50] <DSD24> Pale Sickness?
[8:13:50] <ingman112> New stuff is under 2
[8:13:55] <ingman112> 2
[8:13:57] <%sahykikserpent14> ill watch the vod as I grind in poe
[8:14:06] <+Daedalus119> has he talked to the scab leader about the tattoos yet?
[8:14:09] <heartlesshealer> =T
[8:14:14] <vilecrois> noooo
[8:14:17] <+emperri> @Daedalus119 he has
[8:14:17] <ingman112> He did
[8:14:17] <+lukausedsteal> HERE WE GO
[8:14:19] <pi_in_the_sci> 1
[8:14:20] <penitentpendant> Just give her a panic attack
[8:14:25] <+emperri> CHECK IT OUT
[8:14:33] <heartlesshealer> kalfgj
[8:14:36] <ingman112> "Please don't shoot me"
[8:14:36] <+JustToWatch> what is the passive he needed to make?
[8:14:36] <jin_kazamaru> I felt the conclusion to that quest to be disappointing in the end, simply because the outcome in my eyes wasn't ideal
[8:14:37] <hippofant> Did Pat run into the loop? PridePog
[8:14:40] <akitanito> spaghettis flying out
[8:14:41] <Blank9> HEY BART CHECK OUT MY CHAINSAW AND HOCKEY MASK
[8:14:51] <%Mucmaster> @hippofant yep
[8:14:55] <Blank9> he looped
[8:15:02] <Necnill> ... Pat, it's 8am here in the UK. Are you doing okay brother xD
[8:15:04] <penitentpendant> @hippofant Mr. Evrart was helping him find his gun
[8:15:06] <+xTJPBQdfNHA7qUxeTd5Uy9gV> I showed you my gun please respond
[8:15:06] <hippofant> @Mucmaster Damn I missed it.
[8:15:10] <+StatesmanPrimal> do you mean the cryptid quest?
[8:15:14] <dds333a> LUL
[8:15:20] <moonmeh> did pat talk to her about the pale
[8:15:21] <%jorniev> there it is
[8:15:26] <%illusiveSaint> are indotribes supposed to be corporations?
[8:15:27] <%Ranryu692> I heard that game was bad
[8:15:27] <+JustToWatch> @dork_doggler what was the passive Pat needed to make?
[8:15:28] <ingman112> He did
[8:15:30] <%Broken_Sonex> @dork_doggler Which one?
[8:15:34] <moonmeh> kk
[8:15:39] <%jorniev> its raining
[8:15:43] <aiutare47> @illusivesaint East India Company type shit
[8:15:50] <%dork_doggler> @JustToWatch I *think* it's reaction speed but I don't actually know
[8:15:51] <dds333a> Nice description, Indeed
[8:16:19] <derap41> Looks like there is Armed Revolution of  the Masses Pat
[8:16:21] <aiutare47> MoralIntern
[8:16:28] <RWLJr98> This music sounds like end game music, are we in the endgame now?
[8:16:29] <derap41> Who'd a thunk it
[8:16:31] <DSD24> 7!
[8:16:32] <%jorniev> THIS IS A BIG ONE
[8:16:34] <+icekept> 8
[8:16:38] <akitanito> 8
[8:16:39] <+lukausedsteal> 8
[8:16:40] <%Bluwizard21> wtf is pat doing up at 3am?
[8:16:41] <+JustToWatch> 8 is pretty good
[8:16:44] <+emperri> evrart is not bluffing lol
[8:16:53] <+luftraumm1> 8
[8:16:54] <%Broken_Sonex> @JustToWatch Alright, why doesn't she sleep?
[8:16:59] <fedemachado96> 3
[8:16:59] <Blank9> 3, fuck wild pines
[8:17:04] <%jorniev> 2
[8:17:04] <+Daedalus119> damn
[8:17:06] <%bigbrothergannon> cute
[8:17:06] <penitentpendant> Round 3
[8:17:08] <%dork_doggler> Looks like it's Glaom O' Clock
[8:17:08] <+lukausedsteal> god I love joyce
[8:17:11] <ingman112> @Broken_Sonex We'll see
[8:17:11] <+emperri> GLOAMING
[8:17:12] <%illusiveSaint> @patstaresat talking to Joyce and Ruby moves the story if you want to finish side quests
[8:17:15] <Blank9> now 2
[8:17:17] <+StatesmanPrimal> 3\
[8:17:19] <+luftraumm1> I'd let the workers have the harbour
[8:17:32] <+luftraumm1> 2 is the least loss of life
[8:17:34] <dds333a> 3
[8:17:37] <%dork_doggler> @illusiveSaint he has until the point of no return, it's no biggy
[8:17:38] <%jorniev> or 2
[8:17:40] <derap41> Get the CIA to assasinate their leader they're good at that
[8:17:42] <ingman112> What do YOU think?
[8:17:46] <+Daedalus119> yeah let the workers have the harbor, it's really not worth killing people
[8:17:47] <+emperri> did chat forget evrart has a brother
[8:17:51] <derap41> well not that good actually
[8:17:54] <ingman112> Or at least talk through your process
[8:17:56] <leinadtonu> Evrat is so corrupt tho
[8:17:56] <aiutare47> @luftraumm1 But that’s just be the beginning
[8:17:57] <Blank9> why would you lick the boots of the corporation that's hiring foreign mercenaries to murder people
[8:17:57] <%jorniev> how do you feel pat
[8:17:58] <%illusiveSaint> 5
[8:18:02] <magboost> oh right the brother
[8:18:04] <%Broken_Sonex> @ingman112 How cryptic. Sigh....
[8:18:09] <Slimeking_Mike> so then 2
[8:18:09] <+StatesmanPrimal> 2 is the least loss of life, but there might be consequences for that
[8:18:10] <kappacino2020> ☢️ oh hey, it's gloam o' clock Kappa
[8:18:11] <jin_kazamaru> This is true possibly
[8:18:13] <Blank9> wild pines is more corrupt
[8:18:14] <akitanito> what do your commie sense tell you?
[8:18:16] <%linSP> I’m full doom pilled cop
[8:18:21] <+emperri> yes?
[8:18:21] <+mental_mashup> Get cia to introduce crack into their neighborhoods to destabilize the masses
[8:18:21] <heartlesshealer> but company won't, that's the problem
[8:18:21] <pi_in_the_sci> 2
[8:18:22] <aiutare47> But they won’t stop at the harbor
[8:18:26] <+StatesmanPrimal> also yeah, she doesn't have the authority
[8:18:27] <+tigerfang86> 2
[8:18:30] <ingman112> @Broken_Sonex If we get past the trigger without it proc'ing, I'll message you
[8:18:34] <%DiscoMatador> true
[8:18:34] <+luftraumm1> I wouldn't like to have any killing under my belt
[8:18:36] <+Daedalus119> yeah, the union leaders are dicks, but not any worse than the company
[8:18:45] <%jorniev> THIS DILOGUE
[8:18:47] <+tigerfang86> well then WHAT CAN you do Joyce
[8:18:49] <DSD24> The pale is a break?
[8:18:49] <%jorniev> dialogue
[8:19:03] <%SirGO0SE> psaMenace
[8:19:08] <derap41> North West Passage
[8:19:09] <+lukausedsteal> Fuckk I love Joyce
[8:19:15] <%Broken_Sonex> @ingman112 Thank you. I get sick of fake answers.
[8:19:29] <%Monkeyweed21> Evrart wants to become the Pablo Escabar of Martinaise
[8:19:36] <%illusiveSaint> the pale is like the loading screen in video games
[8:19:39] <ingman112> @Broken_Sonex Np. Just trying not to spoil unnecessarily, especially if it comes up in this convo
[8:19:40] <%jorniev> VOLTA DO MAR
[8:19:51] <dongy14> this game looks cool
[8:19:52] <GeneralOrangutan> name drop
[8:19:56] <aiutare47> YO
[8:19:56] <DSD24> There's that name again
[8:20:02] <derap41> @Monkeyweed21 Or Castro
[8:20:08] <+tigerfang86> w h a t
[8:20:12] <tanarath> W H A T
[8:20:12] <+StatesmanPrimal> giving away the harbor is the most humane solution but like she said the company wouldn't agree to that
[8:20:13] <+RealMichaelPhelps> He’s still steaming!?!?
[8:20:14] <%dork_doggler> Petrichor is the smell of earth afer it's rained
[8:20:21] <dds333a> Long after time ceases
[8:20:23] <+luftraumm1> Dolores day
[8:20:28] <jin_kazamaru> Mhm Double Ds
[8:20:28] <+StatesmanPrimal> uh oh
[8:20:30] <derap41> This tears in the rain
[8:20:31] <tanarath> The pale creates shit.
[8:20:51] <%Dakuu75> Dude, I jsut woke up from my after-work sleepy-times. I didn't expect Pat to still be streaming. he must be about to pass out
[8:20:53] <+StatesmanPrimal> the pale is like an eldritch reality thing right?
[8:20:55] <+Daedalus119> yeah y'all forget that the pale doesn't just eat reality
[8:21:02] <ingman112> Or rather there was shit beyond the pale. The pale became matter eventually
[8:21:05] <+Daedalus119> it sometimes just makes new things
[8:21:05] <Zomner> oh snap Pat still still playing Disco, I was about to jump to watch the VOD
[8:21:13] <+lukausedsteal> FUCK
[8:21:13] <+StatesmanPrimal> the ouroboros of reality
[8:21:23] <+lukausedsteal> FUCK THIS IS GOOD
[8:21:25] <%jorniev> that linne is so good
[8:21:28] <%Dakuu75> @Zomner I know right. Same.
[8:21:29] <%dork_doggler> @Daedalus119 send me a dm cuz i don't remember shit about that
[8:21:35] <%jorniev> THIS GAME IS SO GOOD
[8:21:45] <marcomatame> i have no idea what's going onnnn
[8:21:52] <dds333a> yeah, it just breaks up the world, and they have methods of preservation.
[8:22:01] <%Ranryu692> @PatStaresAt you're definitely going to want to get The Greatest Innocence from the bookstore before the game is through
[8:22:01] <ingman112> This isola, Revachol's isola, was the first land they found beyond the pale
[8:22:04] <Zomner> I love all these Joyce conversations
[8:22:10] <+StatesmanPrimal> so the pale both devours and then creates it's own reality
[8:22:13] <+Dova573> stream still going?!
[8:22:15] <Zomner> shame I missed the last conversation :(
[8:22:16] <RWLJr98> The bald kid?
[8:22:17] <+Encrouched> Isn't Calliou that bald shit kid
[8:22:18] <+Daedalus119> @Daedalus119 They're talkin about it right now
[8:22:19] <leinadtonu> such an interesting setting
[8:22:29] <UnsteadyFunk> "On Caillou, some bald kid."
[8:22:46] <Blank9> fucking with cockatoos
[8:22:48] <dreamfillah> do you get the CAPITALISM
[8:22:49] <derap41> North west passage basically
[8:22:51] <+StatesmanPrimal> lord of gulls
[8:22:51] <akitanito> yes pat?
[8:22:52] <donutf> @leinadtonu thoughts on the supremacist race theory guy? @PatStaresAt
[8:22:56] <%Dakuu75> the bird rips food out of other bird's throats... wut? lol
[8:22:58] <+PA_Raiden333> so much symbolism
[8:23:14] <donutf> @leinadtonu didnt mean to at
[8:23:14] <ingman112> Before they knew of nothing beyond the pale. Discovering Revachol proved them wrong
[8:23:16] <Alfred_Waaghur> I really don't understand what they're talking about.
[8:23:17] <+StatesmanPrimal> the pale is replacing reality
[8:23:19] <Blank9> they were traveling through the pale
[8:23:22] <%Broken_Sonex> Uh oh Pat's losing the plot
[8:23:25] <%jorniev> REVACHOL was a completely uninhabited archipelago
[8:23:26] <%dork_doggler> @PatStaresAt yes, they literally jsut threw ab. bucnk of hail maries
[8:23:28] <dreamfillah> it's a metaphor for the Bourgeois @dakuu75
[8:23:29] <akitanito> I guess the pale is like a loading screen
[8:23:30] <+SammyOVision> reality began to reform as they came out the other end
[8:23:33] <+emperri> Did he get the part about the weather balloons
[8:23:33] <penitentpendant> They angled appropriately
[8:23:33] <%TIME_PUNCHER> it was a void and then it rained? it's an SCP?
[8:23:37] <%emperordread> By a prophetic Innocence named Dolores Dei
[8:23:42] <pi_in_the_sci> The pale is a vaste empty nothingness, as they drove into the primorial, they condensced a new world with their mind
[8:23:42] <+luftraumm1> they found a world
[8:23:43] <%Maids4lyfe> not boats airships
[8:23:44] <%bassoontyphoon> The pale is disco pat
[8:23:45] <bettysharkface> @PatStaresAt Imagine space dust, forming planets
[8:23:48] <fatalDestiny> The Pale is _weird_, it's a fog of entropy, unreality, in this case is condensed, and formed a new/different reality.
[8:23:49] <%Maids4lyfe> the pale is unreality
[8:23:52] <pi_in_the_sci> building poetry from the emptiness
[8:23:55] <%illusiveSaint> video game new location discovered on map
[8:23:56] <$metzselaar> By chance
[8:23:57] <+Tr1pkT12> The Pale is basically the Bermuda Triangle basically
[8:24:02] <aiutare47> @patstaresat the pale seems to condense. Like water. From vapor into matter.
[8:24:03] <%bevyrage> new chunks loaded in as they expanded the render distance of their procedurally generated world
[8:24:07] <+StatesmanPrimal> oh, their minds crafted a new reality in the pale
[8:24:10] <DianaTheAscian> how do they know there not dimension hopping?
[8:24:13] <$metzselaar> Throwing people into the void
[8:24:15] <dds333a> It's not at all an SCP
[8:24:19] <digaogrunge> They made it with thir minds?
[8:24:34] <derap41> The Pale is just Ice and Fog
[8:24:37] <Blank9> I mean, they could have just exited the other side of the pale.
[8:24:42] <+lukausedsteal> its essentially the "big bang" but localized and with people to observe it.
[8:24:43] <+tigerfang86> and now look at it!
[8:24:43] <ingman112> @DianaTheAscian They don't
[8:24:45] <+Encrouched> when did muny woman become prophet woman
[8:24:59] <jin_kazamaru> They didn't discover Revachol, they manifested passively like dreaming gods
[8:25:01] <Blank9> Once they're out of traveling through it, it's just back to whatever that border to it is.
[8:25:09] <%illusiveSaint> wow time stopped
[8:25:10] <jin_kazamaru> or so I'm guessing
[8:25:11] <dd44dostivei> we've been doomed since colonialism
[8:25:13] <dds333a> And yeah, there are still pockets of reality amongst The Pale, assuming the planet is more Pale, than, well planet
[8:25:14] <+luftraumm1> she was prophet woman before muny
[8:25:15] <DianaTheAscian> @ingman112 k it sounds like they are
[8:25:25] <bettysharkface> This is a world made of remembering life.
[8:25:40] <derap41> @jin_kazamaru Its called poetic expression
[8:25:41] <tanarath> The end of PROPERTY
[8:25:47] <ingman112> @DianaTheAscian The only proof that they aren't are some of the pictures of the planet, which are inconclusive
[8:25:56] <%jorniev> DAMN
[8:25:57] <akitanito> jesus dice
[8:25:58] <mass1997> damn
[8:26:02] <Zomner> you can do it Pat!

[8:29:32] <+luftraumm1> hand eye is important as f
[8:29:34] <%Broken_Sonex> @ingman112 Why does that make her not need to sleep?
[8:29:36] <%SirGO0SE> now that you have gun maybe that's not a bad idea tho
[8:29:38] <%dork_doggler> Unlocks all white checks, that's all it does
[8:29:42] <heartlesshealer> oh hey it's that sanity poem?

[8:30:00] <bettysharkface> Not yet
[8:30:00] <donutf> does anyody wish they could play this on their own currently?
[8:30:00] <%dork_doggler> @PatStaresAt you have the church quest and the commie quest, then endgame
[8:30:00] <%jorniev> you did but not endgame
[8:30:01] <saraizarai> no
[8:30:02] <bettysharkface> No
[8:30:02] <Zomner> did Pat get his gun?
[8:30:02] <heartlesshealer> question mark
[8:30:03] <+SammyOVision> no you still got a lot, there is more
[8:30:03] <marcomatame> why am i illiterate i wanna enjoy get the story too, this aint fair
[8:30:04] <penitentpendant> No, it's a 'secret task'
[8:30:04] <YumAntimatter> that wasn't the point of no return
[8:30:05] <+emperri> You have at least a day
[8:30:06] <+mczarklesby> Lots of side quests left.
[8:30:06] <Blank9> nah you didn't do any sudden jump forward
[8:30:06] <%Monkeyweed21> no
[8:30:07] <%bevyrage> no you're not kicking the timeline forward
[8:30:10] <%gelatinous_cube> there is a point of no return that warns you
[8:30:11] <%Uselesswhitenoise> You can still fuck around
[8:30:12] <+xTJPBQdfNHA7qUxeTd5Uy9gV> not yet.  you can go into a point of no return from now, but you haven't yet.
[8:30:12] <fatalDestiny> There's always only 5 days, regardless of what you do.
[8:30:12] <chippybippers> you've still got a good bit left
[8:30:13] <%Mucmaster> You're in the last half still a good chunk left
[8:30:15] <%Urgotfantasy> Nah
[8:30:16] <Press_X_ToJASON> youve got at least 2 days left
[8:30:17] <fedemachado96> nah
[8:30:17] <Blank9> you just did another chunk you could've done at a lot of other times
[8:30:20] <%dork_doggler> No ignore that I'm an idiot
[8:30:21] <ingman112> Church, cryptozoology, commie, talk to evrart
[8:30:22] <%Uselesswhitenoise> but the end is approching at reasonable speeds
[8:30:24] <+PMAvers> You'll know exactly when you hit a point of no return.
[8:30:24] <RWLJr98> Time skip??
[8:30:25] <Blank9> like getting the body down
[8:30:30] <ingman112> Sure
[8:30:32] <penitentpendant> The game has a very explicit 'point of no return' that lists all major remaining sidequests before letting you continue
[8:30:33] <%VyperVic> you got a day before the point of no return
[8:30:33] <+icekept> u could still do side quest
[8:30:34] <RWLJr98> Season 2????
[8:30:39] <%Ranryu692> YEYEYE WE IN IT
[8:30:42] <%illusiveSaint> the game ended earlier than i expected for me
[8:30:42] <penitentpendant> I appreciated it
[8:30:51] <+Daedalus119> @fatalDestiny 10 days
[8:30:52] <magboost> @marcomatame the game has voice acting
[8:30:53] <fedemachado96> the game will tell you when you're near the end
[8:30:58] <+SammyOVision> pat go to bed time isn't going to move anymore
[8:31:06] <%Broken_Sonex> @ingman112 Oh so not a real answer just "The Pale can do anything!" I see.....
[8:31:07] <chromatic_shadow> @dork_doggler can you whisper me the tidbit he missed?
[8:31:11] <+emperri> ResidentSleeper
[8:31:15] <ingman112> @Broken_Sonex Unclear why in-universe, possibly obsession with the memories of the past and inability to return to your own consciousness? To relax in yourself and dream
[8:31:16] <+luftraumm1> I would have played another month of days un this world

[8:31:43] <ingman112> @Broken_Sonex The pale seems to break down what makes humans human, so it makes sense sleep would be one of the things to go
[8:32:02] <ingman112> @Broken_Sonex But essentially yes
[8:32:15] <+luftraumm1> the pale is non being,  even mathematics fall apart
[8:32:19] <jin_kazamaru> Well the main character seems to sleep, so he can't be THAT exposed?

[8:38:31] <%Uselesswhitenoise> reaction speed?
[8:38:31] <chromatic_shadow> savoir looking low
[8:38:32] <+Joe2187> You didnt get to the part where communism can create metaphysical infrastructure
[8:38:33] <$metzselaar> Reaction sped?
[8:38:33] <JoeSchnieds> Inland or reaction speed!
[8:38:33] <Zomner> save
[8:38:33] <GodGoshDarnIt> Half light?
[8:38:34] <%bevyrage> reaction speed is a good one
[8:38:34] <akitanito> beef up reaction I guess
[8:38:36] <%OfficioPrefectusCorgi> Reaction
[8:38:38] <%Monkeyweed21> espirit
[8:38:40] <%jorniev> VISUAL CALCULOUS
[8:38:40] <pi_in_the_sci> empathy, RReaction, or pain
[8:38:41] <+luftraumm1> hold
[8:38:42] <%emperordread> moar authority
[8:38:44] <Zomner> save for white check rerolls?
[8:38:47] <saraizarai> reaction?
[8:38:49] <$tungmccheese> I beat the game in the time between this and your last stream but I guess I missed this interaction. goddamn impressive.
[8:38:49] <+Tredecian> reaction seems low?
[8:38:52] <derap41> shits going down soon
[8:38:53] <penitentpendant> Save one, other in... RHetoric, Reaction, or Hand/Eye or Half Light
[8:38:54] <magboost> drama?
[8:38:55] <%Uselesswhitenoise> coprs or reaction speed
[8:38:55] <%Mucmaster> reaction speed
[8:38:55] <heartlesshealer> pain, hand eye, or rhetoric are my thoughts
[8:38:57] <+JustToWatch> reaction speed wouldn't be useless
[8:38:59] <leinadtonu> espirit then
[8:39:04] <+Shoosler> so when do you get to mash your junk in to jelly?
[8:39:04] <inimata> Savoir Faire, absolutely
[8:39:05] <Alfred_Waaghur> Visual calculus is a good boi
[8:39:07] <%naph_runs> damn it
[8:39:07] <aiutare47> fair
[8:39:08] <Blank9> yeahhhh
[8:39:09] <ingman112> BOOM
[8:39:09] <inimata> rip
[8:39:09] <+tigerfang86> HE DID IT
[8:39:09] <akitanito> I thought you were saving one point
[8:39:10] <tanarath> Visual Calc?
[8:39:11] <%jorniev> DONE THEN
[8:39:12] <Hellarussian> no stop it
[8:39:13] <+tigerfang86> HE WENT AND DID IT
[8:39:13] <+Joe2187> Quick reflexes
[8:39:15] <Alfred_Waaghur> Rad
[8:39:19] <JoeSchnieds> nice
[8:39:19] <+PMAvers> Rooty Tooty Shooty Sheriff Harry
[8:39:21] <Zomner> he did it
[8:39:23] <heartlesshealer> bye skill points
[8:39:24] <$metzselaar> Reaction at 4 seems like a good goal
[8:39:27] <+Joe2187> I see he stole the boots
[8:39:27] <digaogrunge> SO FAST
[8:39:30] <dr_sweets> @Shoosler When someone else wants to do fuck with him
[8:39:34] <+lukausedsteal> kiss your partner goodnight
[8:39:35] <RWLJr98> Wow thanks for asking weirdo
[8:39:35] <aiutare47> going on 9 hours
[8:39:35] <%VyperVic> I would disagree with that plan, but can't without light spoiling, so I won't
[8:39:45] <%Urgotfantasy> kiss kim
[8:39:50] <%jorniev> LEAVE IT HERE?
[8:39:52] <Ralfclogs> Maybe chat should have pumped reaction
[8:39:53] <donutf> you found a strange sickle in your pocket
[8:39:58] <+luftraumm1> honestly the more I'm familiar with this game the more I like motorics
[8:40:01] <%TIME_PUNCHER> I never knew communism could make me a horny ork-turnip hybrid
[8:40:07] <dds333a> All dressed up for it too CarlSmile
[8:40:08] <dreamfillah> REPTILIAN BRAiN?
[8:40:14] <+emperri> Motorics is a red-headed stepchild
[8:40:15] <+RushUnplugged> motorics is the hidden goat of the game
[8:40:21] <DSD24> I like 2
[8:40:23] <ingman112> Motorics is the indispensable Party Rogue to every other class
[8:40:23] <Blank9> having almost all your stats at like 4 means nothing's out of your reach
[8:40:29] <Devbob98> Sleep with gun
[8:40:30] <+Shoosler> ok here we go mashing junk into jelly

[8:41:36] <+StatesmanPrimal> Limbic system PogChamp
[8:41:36] <%bevyrage> did the stream just die for anyone else

[8:42:13] <RWLJr98> Pushing back the PTSD
[8:42:17] <+Shoosler> he's saying there's so much dialogue to keep you from the end of the game
[8:42:19] <donutf> the crushing realistion that you are not observing and doing enough in your life for it to be meaningful? is that *it*?

[8:44:13] <+Tredecian> brain says church
[8:44:14] <penitentpendant> That combo of gun and clip board makes me think of Harry as a super villain: "THE CENSUS TAKER"
[8:44:22] <%bevyrage> have you gone into the house to your left yet?
[8:44:24] <ingman112> Bada boom

[8:45:31] <ingman112> 3 at most
[8:45:32] <%Arancet> another stream like this would do it
[8:45:32] <%Broken_Sonex> I dunno
[8:45:32] <%jorniev> I DONT KNOW
[8:45:33] <derap41> 1 if you pull oone like this
[8:45:34] <Alfred_Waaghur> yeah
[8:45:34] <%VyperVic> I'd say so.
[8:45:35] <+lukausedsteal> I'd say three but yeah
[8:45:35] <+RushUnplugged> you could do it in 1, 2 is safe
[8:45:36] <Zomner> yee
[8:45:36] <%Mucmaster> Maybe 3 depends
[8:45:39] <%bevyrage> you could get three streams out of it if you try to 100%
[8:45:39] <+JustToWatch> yeah 1 or 2 until you beat the prologue
[8:45:40] <%VyperVic> probably 2
[8:45:41] <Slimeking_Mike> about 2 if youre persistent yea
