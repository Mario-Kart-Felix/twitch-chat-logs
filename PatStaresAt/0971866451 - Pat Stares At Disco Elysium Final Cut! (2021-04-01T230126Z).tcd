[0:01:40] <%Esparsenior> psaBig psaGoblin
[0:01:43] <%maskedsongbird> Hobocop--the prequel to Hobo With a Chainsaw that we've been waiting for...
[0:01:46] <+livingdynamo> the splash screen had a critical fail on saviour faire
[0:01:56] <DublinRage> so is Pat actually going to play Disco Elysium, or "prank" us with something else?
[0:01:59] <RyuuAoi> Kenshi?
[0:02:19] <+OwlLightningMage> Kenshi was yesterday. Pat hated it.
[0:02:20] <That_Dogg> Disco Elysium PogChamp
[0:02:36] <socratetris> I am literally here for the pre-chat and then leaving, cuz I am still mostly unspoiled for this game
[0:02:41] <%maskedsongbird> Well, the integration's already on the screen, so I think the chances of an April Fools' prank is pretty low.
[0:02:41] <%maenos2> chk chk chk chk - reload
[0:02:42] <+Shonen_hero> no more lies on stupid lie day pls
[0:02:45] <CappuccinoGuil> I thought today was gonna be outriders?

[0:03:03] <%Mendin> Tomrrow early afternoon is outriders
[0:03:06] <%Mendin> today is Fortnite

[0:04:27] <%maenos2> no no I meant the gief but I misunderstood anyway
[0:04:28] <@SoFarFetched> Too bad people can't play Little Lies on stream because of DMCA Kappa
[0:04:28] <penitentpendant> @CappuccinoGuil Refund it again for another win in Gungeon
[0:04:34] <+OwlLightningMage> Pat uninstalled Kenshi on stream LUL
[0:04:37] <+Shonen_hero> what even is Kenshi?
[0:04:42] <+trllly> Pat should totally play Lego games
[0:04:42] <%maskedsongbird> @Mendin Wait, is Chaos Legion actually happen? I haven't thought about that game since I was a kid...
[0:04:42] <DovaDude29> Quagmire got to zangief’s drink oh jeez oh god god a NotLikeThis NotLikeThis

[0:05:10] <CappuccinoGuil> @OwlLightningMage not the game, the stream I mean LUL
[0:05:15] <+OwlLightningMage> @cappuccinoguil He really REALLY didn't like it
[0:05:20] <jayy_roden> Man I'm so sad Disco is still not out on switch.
[0:05:21] <@SoFarFetched> Kenshi is fine depending who you ask. It's a "not for everyone" type of game.
[0:05:21] <+TheotherKristian> Outriders im a VERY unfortunate launch-state
[0:05:26] <+TheotherKristian> *in
[0:05:26] <%maskedsongbird> This Jank Jonk song is actually pretty cool...
[0:05:28] <%Meidolaon> Pat is basically turning into a human pill I s2g
[0:05:28] <%SharkMissile> he just didn't jive with it
[0:05:36] <%MrMegaJackpots> chat I missed the last stream, did pat go full commie cop?
[0:05:42] <@SoFarFetched> Though that goes for most games,its literally depending if its for you or not.
[0:05:48] <+Shonen_hero> it could be bad or it could be it ain't his bag
[0:05:53] <jorniev> @MrMegaJackpots went full fail cop
[0:06:00] <+Shonen_hero> or both
[0:06:08] <CappuccinoGuil> @OwlLightningMage I wanna check the game out myself, so I didn't watch the stream, but I might have to check the youtube upload when it comes up

[0:09:19] <penitentpendant> Unironically, unsarcastically. Congrats on opening the ledger. I find that 'questline' the most interesting because your STATS will fight you over it. Especially Inland Empire and Voliton.
[0:09:20] <+blastazoid00> Hump the pillow

[0:09:45] <%orcstr16> Tim Rogers decided not to post an update because it's april fools and he didn't want people to think he was fucking with them. I don't blame him, but I'm sitting here thinking that I would have liked that update. Curse you april fools.
[0:09:45] <+RadissonTC> You look real sleepy
[0:09:48] <%MrMegaJackpots> did you shoot it?
[0:09:50] <%SharkMissile> Ooooof the Ledger of Sadness

[0:09:58] <otakon17> OH HELL YEAH THIS GONNA BE GOOD
[0:09:59] <AvroEltz> Hey pat will you get the body down or explore the commercial area?
[0:09:59] <AtticusofBronne> @patstaresat you cannot control the Red Cyclone
[0:10:04] <%Esparsenior> Honestly, playing and ‘save scumming’ isn’t a bad thing in Disco Elysium. Getting the ending you want and seeing the whole story behind the ex-something is really impactful and important to enjoying the games story.
[0:10:05] <%walternatorz> has pat beat Kenshi yet?
[0:10:06] <huskarl_zap> PUT IT ALL ON  ELECTROCHEM
[0:10:07] <AMDBR9S> i wonder what cop pat is going to be
[0:10:14] <%AzureGale> Literally, as opposed to figuratively
[0:10:14] <+Shonen_hero> can you succeed hobo cop? Can you?
[0:10:15] <otakon17> I hear both a Gief AND an Elmo
[0:10:18] <+mczarklesby> He can tell chat would prefer if the body were no longer in the tree.
[0:10:20] <otakon17> Snoring and Purring at the same time
[0:10:21] <+Tredecian> game is dense
[0:10:22] <Ravioli_Ronin> Gonna watch and not play because they won’t announce a switch release date
[0:10:22] <%SirGO0SE> eyedur

[0:10:25] <cardamomo88> no spolier dude
[0:10:28] <%Mr_Pylon> Last stream was a central run, or a centrist run if you will
[0:10:29] <aiutare47> you ruined that dudes life
[0:10:29] <marvel877> How was the Kenshi stream yesterday, Pat?
[0:10:30] <penitentpendant> Praise the Ledger!
[0:10:31] <%maskedsongbird> Hobocop is ascendant
[0:10:31] <otakon17> The game is DENSE
[0:10:32] <%Alazull> Y'all need to understand that this game is DENSE
[0:10:33] <%crimsonharvest> I scummed the 'punch measurehead' choice just to see how it went, well worth it
[0:10:34] <%TheMattman1313> Don't forget CUNO
[0:10:36] <%orcstr16> I hope you continue to not get the body down a few more times. It's hilarious.
[0:10:36] <%blastyoboots> And CUNO
[0:10:37] <KaiserMario> It was very productive all things considered...
[0:10:42] <%SharkMissile> Kim, good Partner Best friend
[0:10:47] <Tisaric> you don't have to do the body in the first day at all btw
[0:10:48] <kikoeru_san> Fuckin CUNO

[0:11:59] <DiagunAquila> sick!
[0:12:00] <aiutare47> and the game said "Suffer"
[0:12:00] <%Monkeyweed21> SIGMA PILLED
[0:12:01] <Ravioli_Ronin> Redpilling dollar store Severus snape

[0:12:09] <%Monkeyweed21> RED PILL COACH
[0:12:09] <otakon17> YOU FOOL!
[0:12:10] <dinnydanny777> The game makes you suffer for your bad choices, I both love and hate it for that NotLikeThis
[0:12:11] <+OwlLightningMage> This game is super nuts
[0:12:15] <iosephe> can't run from the cock carousel

[0:12:39] <otakon17> those are good stats actually
[0:12:39] <%maskedsongbird> The game refused to let you coward out--once you pick the Cock Carousel you are COMMITTED TO RIDING
[0:12:39] <bettysharkface> Fun fact: there is an achievement for getting through the game without taking the body down.
[0:12:41] <+OwlLightningMage> IT DOES WORK ON MOBILE
[0:12:42] <RyuuAoi> Pc only
[0:12:45] <%Takreth> 2
[0:12:46] <+OmegaWeltall> the pepo?
[0:12:47] <%OfficioPrefectusCorgi> 5
[0:12:48] <otakon17> 4/4/2/2 is decent
[0:12:49] <DiagunAquila> WHAT
[0:12:51] <%maenos2> ok on mobile app and I got it
[0:12:54] <+RyTYoung> There's a little icon of the game if you tap the screen on phone
[0:12:58] <%orcstr16> Disco Elysium is easily one of my favorite games. It's so good.
[0:13:00] <%maskedsongbird> WAIT REALLY
[0:13:01] <%SirGO0SE> GOOD
[0:13:02] <aiutare47> @bettysharkface No spoiler but how the fuck can you?
[0:13:02] <%abelincoln_catpuncher> I used the mobile interactions all laser stream
[0:13:02] <%Broand> ohno
[0:13:03] <PinoProxie> df can stop you
[0:13:06] <%crimsonharvest> dwarf fortress is way way easier than kenshi
[0:13:09] <Ravioli_Ronin> Peeeeeepo
[0:13:10] <NitronStreams> on mobile its an icon you click on in chat
[0:13:10] <Visorak6> If you play dwarf fortress at least put a tileset on it
[0:13:11] <%maenos2> touch dorf
[0:13:11] <%maskedsongbird> DF would be such a cool stream
[0:13:11] <+RyTYoung> It's at the top of chat
[0:13:12] <otakon17> Dude do not touch DF
[0:13:15] <+FreshlyGratedGinger> dicko elizardman hype
[0:13:17] <%SveriSageAdvice> wow i just checked, the extension on mobile is actually really rad
[0:13:17] <jorniev> ENJOY IT
[0:13:17] <otakon17> your mind goblins will consume you
[0:13:18] <%facto905> Whens the 24h Kenshi stream? psaLiz_SG
[0:13:18] <+OwlLightningMage> It works on the mobile app
[0:13:18] <penitentpendant> Don't touch Dwarf Fortress. You might reach "Fun"
[0:13:20] <@JustinianKnight> Dwarf Fortress will touch you Pat
[0:13:20] <+blastazoid00> I'd watch a
[0:13:21] <bettysharkface> No idea lol.
[0:13:27] <+pectusumbra> But will you touch Cultist Simulator?
[0:13:28] <iosephe> That one you actually need a wiki for
[0:13:30] <%crimsonharvest> "losing" is "fun"
[0:13:31] <+blastazoid00> I'd watch a Dwarf Fortress stream
[0:13:32] <jorniev> @facto905 never again
[0:13:35] <DiagunAquila> icon on the chat eh?
[0:13:38] <aiutare47> Kenshi wishes it was as fuck-off confusing as DF
[0:13:41] <%blastyoboots> DF is BAD UI
[0:14:01] <%crimsonharvest> only cowards are afraid of the UI, the real issue in DF is framerate death
[0:14:05] <@SoFarFetched> she would
[0:14:07] <Jaysky> Funny HOW
[0:14:07] <+OmegaWeltall> LUL
[0:14:08] <%AzureGale> LUL
[0:14:10] <+OwlLightningMage> Would I like DF if I already like Kenshi?
[0:14:11] <PinoProxie> LUL
[0:14:12] <%SirGO0SE> LUL
[0:14:14] <DovaDude29> Dwarf fortress hits weird
[0:14:17] <%AEUG_Ace_Kamille> Dorf Fortress is an... interesting experience.
[0:14:19] <cardamomo88> LUL
[0:14:21] <@SoFarFetched> She then goes Joe Pesci on us D:
[0:14:23] <%orcstr16> Looking at dwarf fortress is like looking into an endless abyss of confusion until you figure it out.
[0:14:23] <DiagunAquila> Yo thats so easy to miss. Its so dark i didnt see it till it was mentioned! its in the top right of chat for the twitch app
[0:14:25] <dinnydanny777> Funny how? monkaS
[0:14:30] <%SuckerPunchSyd> I literally took a class to learn DF
[0:14:30] <cardamomo88> gogoogoog¡
[0:14:35] <soundcloud_raptor> COP TIME
[0:14:36] <AMajorTom> Funny ... lookin'
[0:14:37] <aiutare47> @OwlLightningMage Possibly? its much harder but if you survived Kenshi's time sink opening maybe
[0:14:37] <%crimsonharvest> you'd probably find it easy @OwlLightningMage you start with 7 people and dont need building materials or research
[0:14:39] <%Puhff> no one actually likes dwarf fort
[0:14:39] <%SuckerPunchSyd> And still ended up confused LUL
[0:14:41] <bettysharkface> Yeyeyeyeye
[0:14:41] <jorniev> DICK EM DOWN
[0:14:42] <DovaDude29> Real talk Pat staring at Dwarf Fortress would be so maximum
[0:14:43] <+A_DEAD_SHOW> Not a lot of subs MonkaS
[0:14:45] <%Puhff> it's a government lie
[0:14:51] <@SoFarFetched> Yeah with mobile being small,it does make finding the stuff on it being hard.
[0:14:56] <Sotetsu> How is babby formed
[0:14:56] <%AEUG_Ace_Kamille> DETECTIVE NOW ON THE SCENE
[0:14:57] <%SirGO0SE> psaDab
[0:14:58] <%thatfeel> Hobocop time
[0:15:00] <+OwlLightningMage> You all are selling me on DF LUL
[0:15:02] <cardamomo88> TIME TO DISCO
[0:15:03] <Blank9> just remember, every stat is good for a lot, except savoir faire
[0:15:03] <bettysharkface> God the music...every time...
[0:15:11] <jorniev> revachol militia  gooo

[0:15:36] <%Esparsenior> Music is exceptional. It’s perfect for Disco Elysium
[0:15:36] <@JustinianKnight> I should probably play this now seeing as you gave it to me a while ago
[0:15:41] <jorniev> CHECK THE FENCE
[0:15:41] <Jaysky> Ask it nicely
[0:15:44] <+OwlLightningMage> Voting only works when Pat clicks the button
