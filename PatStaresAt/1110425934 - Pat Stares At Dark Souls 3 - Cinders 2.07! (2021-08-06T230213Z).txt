[0:09:08] <+sashagreenspiderqueen> @PatStaresAt wanting to get back into 14 from when i ran out of content in shb, is your old crafter guide still relevant?
[0:09:11] <%WhereIsWill> sup sigmapat and chat psaDab psaDab psaDab
[0:09:11] <JehutyVer2> I thought Kolumbo was the guy that made metal gear
[0:09:14] <%Ipsenscastle> just got here, why are we describing Columbo?
[0:09:15] <Mirrorcatch> and the unseen wife, so easily forgotten
[0:09:18] <+sonofthedeepsouth> Chad Columbo

[0:10:20] <%patriotrenegade> When "Columbo" ended it almost caused a revolution in Cold War Romania @PatStaresAt
[0:10:22] <thetruenicster> Columbo is an enigma no one can figure out
[0:10:23] <deviljhojho_> columbo was the exception that proves the rule
[0:10:24] <dekkitout> In short, he's a non-Jojo Jojo character
[0:10:25] <bob900000> is it good?
[0:10:28] <%sniffy77> I like watching Monk and seeing which of the newly introduced minor characters of the episode is the murderer.
[0:10:28] <+AmanisHouseOfNonsense> That honestly sounds like a fun angle for a detective show
[0:10:29] <+sonofthedeepsouth> Columbo saw every crime ever commited
[0:10:29] <cgreene64> It is copaganda, they don't do that on TB
[0:10:30] <thetruenicster> also, I believe Columbo hates guns?
[0:10:32] <%patriotrenegade> Romania asked Peter Falk to help prevent an uprising after the country ran out of Columbo episodes The actor delivered a speech to the Romanian people to assure them that a new season was on the way
[0:10:32] <+sonofthedeepsouth> EYYYYY
[0:10:38] <+CupandSorcerer> Columbo is good

[0:11:02] <+TheBitingIrish> Are we talking about Columbo due to the fact that he is in Final Fantasy?
[0:11:05] <%JoshManVGH> Man! Watching Psych recently, and the Lasceter shooting people bits hit WAY differently now.
[0:11:06] <deviljhojho_> stroke

[0:36:43] <%RealThiele> Mythic is fuck you difficulty
[0:36:43] <%Dakuu75> I only recently started using mods. Like the FGoV mod for RE Village, or a ReShader for FFX. It's pretty great.
[0:36:49] <linSP> Last time I played cinders, I went straight to ringed city and beat gael before the base game
[0:36:55] <fugly_nick> Right in the dick
[0:37:00] <+thelonechris> Dick destroyed
[0:37:02] <draca23> @draca23 I figured, considering the starting classes alone. I was just curious.

[0:50:28] <%MuffledEurobeat> This one simple trick?
[0:50:29] <DrkJP520> The game should have 21 ring slots. 20 if you play as female.

[0:52:53] <+thecosmicfly> You cheated not only the game, but yourself. You didn't grow. You didn't improve. You took a shortcut and gained nothing. You experienced a hollow victory. Nothing was risked and nothing was gained. It's sad that you don't know the difference.
[0:52:56] <Dingalow> I reloaded the page and it's even worse now. Twitch is terrible, god damn

[1:01:19] <Whiteherox> music sounds weird?
[1:01:20] <+TheBitingIrish> Yeah, FromSoft decided to pit hackers and modders against each other instead of outright banning them
[1:01:25] <Too_Much_Nukie> You can also infuse weapons/catalysts so they scale with luck now.
[1:01:25] <%vandastelka> oh god
[1:01:29] <DanThePumpkinman> wrong option dumbass
[1:01:29] <linSP> I mean if you play cinders with online enabled you’d definitely get insta banned
[1:01:30] <%flagi64> THATS A WALL OF TEXT
[1:01:31] <%RealThiele> @Jrocy247 fromsoft doesnt like mods and will lock you out of online. game still works

[1:01:39] <%AzureGale> Can I infuse my weapon with citris
[1:01:40] <BigFingerRo> LLLLLLLLLIGHTNIN'

[1:02:16] <%vandastelka> Best mod

[1:04:00] <Ethel9727> So, refighting bosses is now how you get primordial fragments. I think no-hitting increases your chances, but it's mainly based on how strong the boss is. So like, Gael has 100% chance to drop one on re-fight
[1:04:02] <%AzureGale> F
[1:04:09] <EM2_art> Again redsDank
[1:04:09] <%baka_sugoi> dick in SON
[1:04:12] <%TheWinged7> now do it agian
[1:04:16] <%Monkeyweed21> why did they give a cathedral knight a boss health bar?
[1:04:20] <Profmcstevie> I assume if you want to no hit they'd HAVE to give you a refight else it'd be just "well fuck me"
[1:04:29] <cheapdoc> Do you have to walk all the way back for every boss? that can get annoying
[1:04:40] <Too_Much_Nukie> No it isn't Pat.
[1:04:45] <BliVru> it doesnt
[1:04:49] <AoiRob> i mean there's Homeward Bones so who care
[1:04:51] <Krash_Override> nope
[1:04:52] <Too_Much_Nukie> it never brings you back.
[1:04:52] <draca23> Can't you use homeward bone? Or does that make you lose souls? I forget...
[1:04:58] <linSP> usually there’s a bonfire after a boss so
[1:05:02] <Ethel9727> Can't believe crazy talk is actively changing the mod as Pat plays
[1:05:03] <PersonifiedTFT> is that a new moveset for katanas holy shit
[1:05:04] <Too_Much_Nukie> yah use bones.
[1:05:05] <TheReallJimbo> isn't there an item to bring you back?
[1:05:06] <BigFingerRo> Wait, do bosses not make bonfires anymore?
[1:05:10] <$RealThiele> firelink sells bones
[1:05:11] <DSD24> That sword moveset seems different
[1:05:13] <%ironohki> Dope
[1:05:14] <+thefancywig> that's sick
[1:05:15] <Jrocy247> SICK
[1:05:17] <%SharkMissile> Oh that's tasty
[1:05:18] <Slimeking_Mike> GUOOOOOOH
[1:05:24] <%vandastelka> why do you do so much damage my god
[1:05:26] <SaltyAzteca> PAT NEEDS MORE POWER
[1:05:26] <jtsoppy137> motivated
[1:05:27] <%ironohki> @DSD24 Yeah, Pat walked us through it earlier.
[1:05:31] <BliVru> one handed too
[1:05:33] <Laecerelius> Usin that kay-tanner?
[1:05:33] <+TheBitingIrish> Hit Y
[1:05:34] <TheReallJimbo> fuyooooo
[1:05:37] <%capnbeefs> That is really good
[1:05:41] <%Paperware> The crescent axe also has a unique dash attack
[1:05:43] <Ethel9727> There's a lot of new movesets. I think some are either straight imported or REALLY well replicated for DeS and Bloodborne weapons
[1:05:44] <%ironohki> @SaltyAzteca Strength go up!
[1:05:44] <homestylewaffles> @vandastelka Reinforcement is gone. Weapon base damage is just higher by default now
[1:05:48] <DSD24> @ironohki Oh cool I just got here but that's neat he covered it
[1:05:58] <cheapdoc> Dark souls Sol Badguy edition
[1:06:00] <Ethel9727> Reinforcement is regular titanite path for all weapons in this mod
[1:06:05] <%RD_NX> does the BKGS have new moveset
[1:06:07] <+TheBitingIrish> Did they change it back?
[1:06:11] <%capnbeefs> Really, you have to teleport
[1:06:13] <Krash_Override> no its gone
[1:06:17] <homestylewaffles> it was straight up gone for a while
[1:06:18] <%Treasure_Vault> @Ethel9727 Good, DS1 had the best Dark Knight weapon movesets.
[1:06:22] <Too_Much_Nukie> There is an optional mode where reinforcement gone and you get a passive damage increase with each boss kill.
[1:06:27] <homestylewaffles> unless they brought it back
[1:06:27] <$Ziegsy> like if the people behind this mod came together and put up a kickstarter? id back it.
[1:06:33] <Too_Much_Nukie> Krash you are incorrect.
[1:06:35] <dekkitout> Steiner cosplay time
[1:06:42] <Profmcstevie> What is and isn't in this mod is volatile, it shifts greatly between versions LUL
[1:06:47] <Laecerelius> GENETIC FREAK
[1:07:00] <+Shady_Zaku> THE GENETIC FRREEAK
[1:07:00] <%vandastelka> nice stat buffs with armor
[1:07:03] <cheapdoc> ADVENTURE HUZZAAAAH
[1:07:04] <%Frost_Quill> I like talking to an npc to level up.
[1:07:09] <%capnbeefs> Western samurai
[1:07:09] <dekkitout> Soul of Cinder has a 33 and a quarter chance now
[1:07:13] <AoiRob> WAIFU CHAN
[1:07:14] <%MrBorisMakarov> man the modding community for this game is so great
[1:07:16] <Laecerelius> Adventure awaits!
[1:07:17] <Ultimatefool> The ONE PROBLEM with this mod is that since everything has changed, you need to read absolutely every fucking item description
[1:07:18] <Krash_Override> unless they brought it back, if he clicks reinforcement, it says that you dont use it
[1:07:29] <+Shady_Zaku> ADVENTURE, AWAITS! HUAZZA
[1:07:30] <%vandastelka> oh your on the other side
[1:07:31] <%Treasure_Vault> Yeah but this area was stupid in the original, better as a spawn point
[1:07:33] <%capnbeefs> Huzzah!!!!!
[1:07:33] <%Monkeyweed21> SAMAO JOE KNOWS HE CANT LINK THE FLAME
[1:07:33] <Too_Much_Nukie> They brought it back.
[1:07:39] <Too_Much_Nukie> this is 2.06.1
[1:07:57] <Krash_Override> hold on let me check my version
[1:07:58] <Wydamn> Someone's been watching Joel Havar's rotoscope videos

[1:09:04] <+Eizack> NPCs are a lot easier to kill if you don't wake a mimic up right before you fight them, too.
[1:09:05] <+Shady_Zaku> rip
[1:09:05] <BigFingerRo> SHE TBAGGED
[1:09:05] <cheapdoc> Get SQUAT

[1:09:09] <tanarath> BIG plan
[1:09:11] <%Piemono> You had a bad plan
[1:09:13] <Ethel9727> Can't believe Crazy Talk activates when Pat merely thinks things now
[1:09:14] <AoiRob> double teabag oof

[1:09:20] <%vandastelka> both did the squat
[1:09:23] <%baka_sugoi> plan failed
[1:09:30] <blue8moon> clearly they are friends
[1:09:32] <%Monkeyweed21> @PatStaresAt the mimic aggros to whoever first hits it as a chest
[1:09:33] <BigFingerRo> STANCIN up on you
[1:09:33] <Profmcstevie> Is friendly fire in ANY fromsoft game, original or mod?
[1:09:33] <Jetsfantasy> @fugly_nick Just checked, you download this from Nexusmods. So yes, it's on the Nexus
[1:09:35] <Ultimatefool> @ChatNinja Last I played, no, but your route through the game can wildly vary now due to various shortcuts
[1:10:01] <%Issun135> Issun135 subscribed at Tier 1. They've subscribed for 18 months! wtf happened to cinders since 1.81 theres life gems now
[1:10:06] <%lloyddboy> LUL
[1:10:08] <jtsoppy137> LUL
[1:10:11] <+TaurusOxford> LUL
[1:10:11] <Laecerelius> Amazing

[1:10:15] <Jrocy247> LIAR
[1:10:16] <BigFingerRo> DOESN'T COUNT FUCK YOU

[1:10:17] <dekkitout> StinkyCheese
[1:10:20] <%coward_man> LMAO GOTTEM
[1:10:20] <tanarath> BIG plan
[1:10:22] <+Shady_Zaku> WHADDA FUCK
[1:10:23] <%Monkeyweed21> also not every enemy can hit a mimic as a chest
[1:10:25] <%Romuken> koboldLul koboldLul koboldLul
[1:10:28] <+Eizack> She a red phantom, not a purple
[1:10:28] <%Issun135> sick
[1:10:30] <Wydamn> she's no Pharris
[1:10:32] <DSD24> Does she have a Bloodborne dash?
[1:10:33] <+Shady_Zaku> one guy
[1:10:39] <%Monkeyweed21> Only certain attacks like the demon's fire breath
[1:10:43] <%moonmintparadise> ONE GUY STRIKES AGAIN
[1:10:43] <AoiRob> this mod was made to inconvenience pat specifically
[1:10:47] <%baka_sugoi> poke
[1:10:49] <%BoxNavy> they were awful
[1:10:50] <%Broand> use the cool gatana stance!
[1:10:50] <%vandastelka> wtf blood borne dashes?
[1:10:55] <Wydamn> woolieONEGUY
[1:11:00] <Ethel9727> Quickstep is really easy to get in the mod and some Bloodborne weapons change the animation of quickstepping to the Bloodborne dash.
[1:11:02] <Ultimatefool> That's fucking strong
[1:11:06] <%Frost_Quill> Not killing the mimic?
[1:11:07] <%BoxNavy> monkaS
[1:11:10] <homestylewaffles> @DSD24 quickstep is dramatically buffed in this mod, and you can get a ring that lets you have it all the time
[1:11:13] <EM2_art> Jebaited
[1:11:17] <BigFingerRo> Ooooh
[1:11:18] <%Romuken> ew
[1:11:18] <%vandastelka> oh
[1:11:21] <%BoxNavy> :tf:
[1:11:29] <%Broand> I thought it dumped you in the dank dragons peak
[1:11:31] <%Monkeyweed21> do it coward
[1:11:33] <+Eizack> Why would you want that?
[1:11:33] <Ethel9727> You can also get guns so if you want you can *just* play this as Bloodborne
[1:11:35] <DSD24> @homestylewaffles That's super rad
[1:11:42] <%Issun135> oh yea its great for starting a "lightsaber" mage class with aquamarine dagger
[1:11:45] <dekkitout> Go mimic-chan!
[1:11:47] <+redthebaron> love to just commune with random stuff i found
[1:11:51] <Too_Much_Nukie> @broand Old version it did
[1:11:55] <+Fooguwu> nice chainmail DORK
[1:11:56] <%bassoontyphoon> If you commune with that does that make you a commune-ist??
[1:12:08] <%vandastelka> my god
[1:12:11] <luftraumm1> do the bloodborne guns stagger enemies?
[1:12:12] <fugly_nick> That's a lot of endurance
[1:12:15] <BigFingerRo> twenty sev-uuuuuuhm
[1:12:29] <EM2_art> Endurance build PogChamp
[1:12:32] <Too_Much_Nukie> @luftraumm1
[1:12:35] <Too_Much_Nukie> yes
[1:12:46] <luftraumm1> ooooo
[1:12:48] <Profmcstevie> Dump endurance, R1 to victory!
[1:12:52] <%Broand> what's the meme for this build anyway? I started a vanilla run in DaS3 as "unarmoured dweeb with gatana"
[1:12:53] <ZeeJiggle> tha's a good button
[1:12:57] <KnightOfTrousers> This with Cinders mod?
[1:13:02] <storytayl0r> This one weird trick, hollows hate it
[1:13:17] <+Monograxo> wait this adds lifegems?
[1:13:31] <%vandastelka> Its literally the nago slash combo
[1:13:42] <cheapdoc> Would you say it's too strong?
[1:13:44] <Wydamn> lifegems PogChamp
[1:13:52] <luftraumm1> unarmored katana weeb is a very fun build
[1:13:58] <Aydarkzero> any little bit helps i suppose
[1:14:05] <Ethel9727> It adds lifegems BUT their animation is super long so they are verydangerous
[1:14:08] <+Monograxo> makes sense then
[1:14:11] <Jontman42> is Yhorm an actual boss now?
[1:14:12] <+Fooguwu> wh...whored?
[1:14:13] <+Mrbaconator> whored
[1:14:14] <%Broand> Curse of extra dudes is also available
[1:14:15] <%baka_sugoi> Hord
[1:14:18] <%Axellogic> Like a Dragon's Hoard?
[1:14:21] <Ultimatefool> Yeah, you do hundreds of damage at base level but the bosses get 10s of thousands of HP later on
[1:14:22] <EM2_art> Reinforcements are back in the mod?
[1:14:28] <draca23> Beaten or expert?
[1:14:30] <%RealThiele> Hoord
[1:14:31] <cheapdoc> 'cause it looks pretty easy so far
[1:14:32] <Aydarkzero> good
[1:14:32] <+Shady_Zaku> Horde
[1:14:35] <fugly_nick> Oh thank god
[1:14:40] <luftraumm1> I recognize most enemy placements here
[1:14:40] <Jrocy247> GOOD
[1:14:44] <fugly_nick> I fucking hated that area
[1:14:45] <%vandastelka> ok good
[1:14:47] <Aydarkzero> @draca23 little of both isn't so bad
[1:14:54] <%Issun135> yay solaire is still there
[1:14:56] <%baka_sugoi> lit
[1:14:57] <trfurkanrey18> where claymore
[1:14:58] <%Frost_Quill> This one still a mimic?
[1:15:00] <Aydarkzero> claymore use to be there right?
[1:15:03] <%GodDougle> GodDougle subscribed at Tier 1. They've subscribed for 9 months, currently on a 9 month streak! 
[1:15:09] <%vandastelka> wtf
[1:15:12] <homestylewaffles> @trfurkanrey18 you can just buy it from Andre from the get go
[1:15:16] <%vandastelka> PRAISE THE SUN
[1:15:19] <luftraumm1> wtf?
[1:15:21] <%RealThiele> grossly incandescent
[1:15:22] <Aydarkzero> Solaire is suppose to be a worm though Kappa
[1:15:22] <+TheBitingIrish> Lookit that jolly vagrant
[1:15:24] <trfurkanrey18> @trfurkanrey18 hmm
[1:15:27] <Gelphaze> MIMIC!
[1:15:30] <+Monograxo> how does the covenant work if you can't play online?
[1:15:34] <fugly_nick> Thanks for the help Solaire
[1:15:36] <AoiRob> marry him
[1:15:38] <Jrocy247> That's a weird placement for Solaire, not gonna lie
[1:15:40] <%dethsenvoy01> powers out so now instead of playing Warframe I'll watch pat on my phone until power returns
[1:15:40] <Wydamn> "If I didn't know any better, I'd say you had feelings for me! Heh heh hah!
[1:15:51] <+twohitgood> pat should check out champion's ashes at some point. it has fully working bloodborne weapons and power stancing.
[1:15:52] <Ultimatefool> @Monograxo Can still get tokens as certain mob drops
[1:15:53] <%Broand> I also want to try out lightning reinforced Javelin
[1:15:54] <%vandastelka> better clothes
[1:15:56] <$Futurecity10> sage freck
[1:15:56] <fugly_nick> Is that Straid?
[1:15:56] <AstrodropGaming> Oh Solaire is just there hanging out
[1:15:57] <luftraumm1> does the katana still have the iai stance?
[1:15:57] <+UltraViolet371> Sage Freke from DeS
[1:15:58] <+Eizack> Looks like Skyrim.
[1:15:58] <Ethel9727> Covenants have offline benefits and let enemies drop the covenant item so you can trade for their stuff
[1:15:59] <%Issun135> ds2 guy i think
[1:16:01] <homestylewaffles> @Monograxo covenants have passive buffs for just equipping them, and enemies will randomly drop the covenant item
[1:16:02] <Ethel9727> Sage Freke
[1:16:05] <Mirrorcatch> Sage Freke?
[1:16:09] <%Broand> you think you can handle my spells?
[1:16:10] <%vandastelka> DES MAYBE
[1:16:10] <linSP> sage frick
[1:16:15] <%Frost_Quill> Freke?  Maybe?
[1:16:15] <BliVru> Ds2 the super invader
[1:16:20] <BlockingDisabled> Demon's Souls guy
[1:16:22] <Aydarkzero> maybe Pat should replay DS2 Kappa
[1:16:23] <%patriotrenegade> freke?
[1:16:28] <%vandastelka> ah that guy
[1:16:31] <Wydamn> Super Freke, Super Freke, he's super frekeee
[1:16:39] <%RealThiele> ass for days in that
[1:16:42] <+rafaelba93> straif?
[1:16:44] <cheapdoc> +2 IMMEDIATELY
[1:16:48] <AncyentMarinere> I like ya cut G
[1:16:50] <linSP> damn pat got a dumpy with that drip
[1:16:51] <+rafaelba93> ah frake
[1:17:16] <Aydarkzero> oh he's idle from now on
[1:17:20] <Aydarkzero> the ring?
[1:17:22] <Profmcstevie> Perfect shields
[1:17:23] <cheapdoc> Yeah, two TINGS
[1:17:23] <+twohitgood> sekiro style parrying?
[1:17:23] <fugly_nick> Perfect block?
[1:17:24] <homestylewaffles> D I N G = perfect block
[1:17:24] <%vandastelka> 3rd strike parry
[1:17:44] <fugly_nick> NO DAMAGE?!
[1:17:45] <Kain5707> ah yes the tinitus noise
[1:17:46] <cheapdoc> Daigo parry
[1:17:48] <%vandastelka> This is the best
[1:17:54] <Ultimatefool> So it's just Sekiro now
[1:17:56] <%Issun135> stamina
[1:17:59] <%Broand> So what kind of build are you running? Uchi dex boy?
[1:18:02] <ToneBacas> so it's like Sekiro's block kinda?
[1:18:04] <Too_Much_Nukie> It still diw
[1:18:07] <Aydarkzero> oh that helps a lot for two handing stuff then
[1:18:12] <Too_Much_Nukie> It still does damage
[1:18:16] <luftraumm1> im super bad with parries and any frame strict mechanics
[1:18:26] <fugly_nick> Oh ok, no damage seemed crazy
[1:18:36] <Aydarkzero> could still give some momentum though
[1:18:53] <Profmcstevie> A good shield is still paramount
[1:18:55] <%Issun135> well if the shield blocks 100% then it is a free block
[1:19:01] <Aydarkzero> red-eye monkaS
[1:19:07] <%RealThiele> poise parry
[1:19:08] <TheReallJimbo> a cock ring? ha! nailed it.
[1:19:12] <%Issun135> perfect block just makes the stamina damage 0
[1:19:17] <%vandastelka> oh boy
[1:19:25] <+fetrigon> is that woolie?
[1:19:26] <%Broand> Does the uchi still have the parry stance
[1:19:44] <FizzyGoodra> F
[1:19:45] <Aydarkzero> thats aggressive
[1:19:45] <DSD24> Stinger
[1:19:45] <Laecerelius> woof
[1:19:45] <fugly_nick> Almost had him
[1:19:47] <%vandastelka> It looks like you need more endurance pat
[1:19:49] <ToneBacas> whenever you're facing a tough foe, just ask yourself: What Would Paige Do?
[1:19:50] <+Monograxo> the shield is up so it must be him
[1:19:51] <luftraumm1> jeez that tracking
[1:19:53] <cheapdoc> If you just try to UNGA his shield, yeah
[1:19:57] <Mudstone12> been thinking about getting back into cinders
[1:20:03] <fugly_nick> You're right, you need more luck
[1:20:15] <cheapdoc> But you did unga
[1:20:18] <Ethel9727> Definitely need more luck
[1:20:21] <%AmanisHouseOfNonsense> More Bunga for the Bunga Hole!
[1:20:29] <+rafaelba93> just more skill
[1:20:32] <%ironohki> That feel when you bunga but not unga.
[1:20:48] <%Treasure_Vault> Your unga:bunga coefficient was low
[1:20:50] <hakumaribo> But Pat i'm a Sol main... all i know is the art of unga and bunga...
[1:20:52] <%RealThiele> Cowabunga it is
[1:20:59] <fugly_nick> Damn he's fast
[1:21:01] <luftraumm1> pat have you  started this build because you got nervous about how much unga paige has become?
[1:21:04] <ToneBacas> neat
[1:21:06] <Aydarkzero> if you can't commit to unga are you even trying FeelsBadMan
[1:21:18] <%Romuken> yo that stack?
[1:21:20] <KosOrSomeSayKosm_> that's pretty good
[1:21:20] <%RealThiele> spin 2 win
[1:21:22] <+OneGorillionDollars> thats an interesting item
[1:21:23] <Mudstone12> do it stack tho?
[1:21:27] <fugly_nick> Does it stack?
[1:21:28] <dekkitout> Oh it's an artifact, neat

[1:21:59] <TheReallJimbo> does it count for the soul from the enemy killed?
[1:21:59] <%BoxNavy> no
[1:22:04] <%RealThiele> im going to assume it stacks additively
[1:22:05] <+rafaelba93> it does not stack the time i dont think
[1:22:08] <+fetrigon> no PunOko
[1:22:10] <%ironohki> Okay, only one samurai was blind.
[1:22:11] <luftraumm1> would work well with a regain thing like bb
[1:22:14] <BackflipCharm> Tiny man has tiny eyes
[1:22:15] <$sylphyyyy> body feel bad. time for pat. pat time is now. now is time to feel better watching pat.
[1:22:15] <total_overkill> Wouldnt be the first Darksouls nut to do it blind...
[1:22:16] <DanThePumpkinman> you're not paige tho
[1:22:17] <%LeiaSkynoober> It's not his fault, he's wearing a blindfold right now
[1:22:18] <ralph4044> or something, probably
[1:22:19] <Jolly_Adventurer> impossible...
[1:22:19] <BigFingerRo> yep, samurais known for their blindness
[1:22:21] <%za7az> What...? LUL
[1:22:22] <%LeiaSkynoober> Like Dunkey
[1:22:24] <%Zeif00> Kappa
[1:22:24] <Mudstone12> samurai are known for being blind correct
[1:22:24] <cheapdoc> But if you're blind and Paige is blind, then who's driving? OMG Gief's driving, how can that be?
[1:22:24] <$Stari> You missed a chest
[1:22:31] <%Monkeyweed21> Pat is the Stinkmeaner of Dark Souls
[1:22:31] <TheAntiNihilist> Paige is a samurai?
[1:22:32] <+Cube382> is this modded??
[1:22:42] <+Monograxo> ye its a mod
[1:22:43] <%ironohki> @cheapdoc Underated comment.
[1:22:45] <Aydarkzero> everyone knows Samurais are blind temporarily Kappa
[1:22:50] <%RealThiele> @cheapdoc Elmo lost his license after the accident

[1:22:57] <BigFingerRo> IS THIS THE DARK SOULS OF STREAMS
[1:22:58] <MrDrayko> READING?
[1:22:58] <%VHGS> you know why.
[1:23:01] <thunka10> cause it doesn't say "mod"
[1:23:03] <%ironohki> Doesn't say the word "mod." Must be unclear.
[1:23:03] <1dennis> it doesnt saay cinders mod it just says cinders
[1:23:03] <Jrocy247> Because people can't read

[1:23:05] <%BoxNavy> twitch chat doesnt read the title
[1:23:05] <%coward_man> in fairness it doesn't say MOD but it does asay Cinders
[1:23:05] <+twohitgood> reading is fundamental.
[1:23:05] <%HairballCT> now pat, you know people don't read

[1:23:14] <+thefancywig> it doesn't say mod in the title but people would still say that lol
[1:23:14] <%General_Terro> imagine reading LUL
[1:23:14] <%ironohki> reading IS hard
[1:23:16] <Jetsfantasy> It only say's "cinders 2.07"
[1:23:16] <%RealThiele> READ A BOOK
[1:23:16] <%SuckerPunchSyd> Because no one reads
[1:23:17] <%CollinsOfBodom> is this dark souls?
[1:23:20] <ToneBacas> maybe they're on mobile and the title cuts off before it reads mod
[1:23:23] <+Shady_Zaku> Zatoichi is badaaaass
[1:23:24] <fugly_nick> I'm bothered by the soul count not being visible
[1:23:24] <%SaiyanShoto> Technically it says Cinders
[1:23:24] <%Archphronimos> it uh.... doesn't actually say "mod"
[1:23:24] <+Monograxo> it doesn't say mod tho
[1:23:25] <%DakotaMacDoodle> You worked retail Pat people don't read
[1:23:27] <+the_drummaestro> mod isn't written tho
[1:23:27] <%MrBorisMakarov> D:

[1:23:30] <Krash_Override> is this a game?
[1:23:30] <thunka10> "Cinders 2.07"
[1:23:32] <dekkitout> "Cinders 2.07" what else does that infer?
[1:23:32] <+fetrigon> actually says cinders 2.07
[1:23:33] <Scrub_Seeker> is this kings field???
[1:23:36] <AMDBR9S> i never read a book in my entire life and i'll keep it that way

[1:23:42] <KosOrSomeSayKosm_> is this bonfire really needed? hrm
[1:23:43] <MoonlightWolves> #ModsforConsoles2021
[1:23:43] <cheapdoc> What does the Blue Tearstone do now?
[1:23:43] <%strakillias> Reading the title is the Dark Souls of reading
[1:23:46] <ToneBacas> fair enough it says Cinders
[1:23:49] <%Broand> We need a dialog randomizer like those Sonic adventure mods
[1:23:53] <LBC921> whats the point of having that bonfire there?
[1:23:57] <robosqueeb> but yeah chat is dumb
[1:23:57] <dekkitout> If there was suddenly a new DS3 dlc, you would know damn well
[1:24:01] <+ClericOfSparda> What does chat think "Cinders 2.07" means, if not a mod?
[1:24:02] <%SuckerPunchSyd> Oh yeah it actually doesnt say mod just says Cinders 2.07
[1:24:03] <%CollinsOfBodom> is this critically acclaimed MMORPG Final Fantasy XIV?
[1:24:03] <BigFingerRo> WHAAAAAAAAA YOU CAN UPGRADE WITHOUT GOING BACK TO FIRELINK???

[1:25:09] <Wydamn> We're playing Cinders with the Dark Souls 3 mod.
[1:25:12] <TheReallJimbo> what happened to angry pat? why he just stare now?
[1:25:13] <Jolly_Adventurer> @RealThiele Yeah I was just making a "The numbers mason" meme. COuld have worded it better

[1:26:00] <BigFingerRo> "PatStaresAt? Cinders mod? Bro, it's 2010, let's watch some more RWJ!"
[1:26:12] <%ironohki> Lizard Hide?
[1:26:13] <homestylewaffles> firebombs always blew em up, but you can't gank em before they transform anymore
[1:26:17] <%Broand> lizard hide?
[1:26:18] <Wydamn> @TheReallJimbo if I remember correctly, what finally led to the rebrand was partly because of the big goofy grin he had in every video thumbnail.
[1:26:26] <AstrodropGaming> Fire indeed hot
[1:26:28] <EM2_art> Throwing items builds now viable?
[1:26:34] <%RealThiele> lizard hide is a soul item
[1:26:35] <EM2_art> LUL
[1:26:38] <TheReallJimbo> @BigFingerRo =3
[1:27:02] <%tactician0> tactician0 subscribed at Tier 1. They've subscribed for 5 months! wow
[1:27:07] <fugly_nick> An angrier pat emerged
[1:27:12] <Profmcstevie> being associated with anger is unpleasant
[1:27:15] <Aydarkzero> Mellow Pat
[1:27:17] <Hoaxfish> Cynical  Gamer Pat
[1:27:17] <+coffeebearCafe> angry is cringe
[1:27:21] <%KeiganOfAstora> Didn't wanna be known as angry for awhile
[1:27:21] <%Broand> Mellowest pat
[1:27:21] <adamant1333> james
[1:27:23] <%BoxNavy> the angry patio game nerd
[1:27:25] <dekkitout> "0/10. Not angry enough"
[1:27:25] <%TheWinged7> avgn
[1:27:27] <%KeiganOfAstora> He's not really that angry
[1:27:27] <+twohitgood> "angry" as a gimmick is also kinda tired.
[1:27:27] <+Monograxo> so you don't want to be associated with pissed off gustavo?
[1:27:28] <cheapdoc> The "Angry" name is very 2010
[1:27:28] <+ClericOfSparda> Makes sense
[1:27:29] <%Treasure_Vault> Pat met a real angry pat and relinquished the title
[1:27:30] <choocheess> james?
[1:27:30] <%MelBrooksKA> Mellow Pat

[1:27:39] <Major_Lee_> Irate Pat

[1:27:47] <Jontman42> James Rolfe of course
[1:27:52] <%RealThiele> post nut clarity
[1:27:53] <yeildingthought> Angry joe is a meme LUL
[1:27:54] <Ethel9727> Pat realized if he kept staying angry he wouldn't be able to survive long enough to become an immortal toilet
[1:27:55] <homestylewaffles> LUL

[1:27:58] <%Frost_Quill> BOAR HELMET

[1:28:03] <%KeiganOfAstora> LUL
[1:28:04] <blue8moon> Pat's really not that angry, at least not nowadays
[1:28:08] <%coward_man> the angry left at a direct rate from the moment you left retail
[1:28:09] <%JoshManVGH> It's ironic
[1:28:14] <Jontman42> Miffed Pat
[1:28:15] <Madinki> You're more cynical than angry. @PatStaresAt
[1:28:16] <Jolly_Adventurer> Pat Smiles at :)
[1:28:17] <+rafaelba93> cutest pat
[1:28:21] <%ironohki> @JoshManVGH Isn't it ironic?
[1:28:24] <%Broand> pat seen here not being a boar
[1:28:26] <%ironohki> Don'tcha think?
[1:28:26] <TheAntiNihilist> More like DabChampPat
[1:28:28] <%RealThiele> RE is more pat centric
[1:28:28] <hakumaribo> @PatStaresAt whats your take on warrior in FFXIV?
[1:28:29] <%Agami23> and now you just use jacksepticeyes logo
[1:28:29] <%BoxNavy> but what happens if you get angry?
[1:28:31] <TheReallJimbo> Canadian's are never angry, just sorry
[1:28:32] <Jontman42> extremely cynical
[1:28:33] <%Zundelle> PatStaresAt just sounds absurd and funny anyway, it's more memorable
[1:28:35] <cheapdoc> Disco Pat
[1:28:36] <Profmcstevie> Good point, the anger was partly left in the retail store he worked at
[1:28:36] <DianaTheAscian> it really is
[1:28:40] <FizzyGoodra> CynicalCanuck
[1:28:44] <Mattais88> It's also why we love watching you enjoy a game
[1:28:46] <%JoshManVGH> @ironohki It's  Like Raiain on yer wedding day!
[1:28:47] <dekkitout> I thought that was sarcasm
[1:28:47] <%Agami23> psaSmug psaSmug
[1:28:48] <%BoxNavy> its a big green and blue eye
[1:28:51] <DianaTheAscian> eh kinda
[1:28:52] <thunka10> it's the same but green
[1:28:53] <$Timesteel> it's similar but green
[1:28:53] <%RAGING_1NF3RNO> CinicPat
[1:28:54] <%Agami23> its basically the same thing but green
[1:28:55] <+Monograxo> sudden paige
[1:29:01] <%xMaSterKeef420bluntNinjAx> That's good. Keep saying that for legal purposes
[1:29:03] <EM2_art> CynicalestPat
[1:29:10] <fugly_nick> I never got that vibe from the eye
[1:29:15] <choocheess> I'd like to think Elmo, Gief, and Paige changed the angry
[1:29:16] <Profmcstevie> TyrantPatStaresAt
[1:29:19] <%Frost_Quill> Bork Mad.
[1:29:20] <%hrbeck_> Jacksepticeye invented Eyes in 2014
[1:29:29] <+twohitgood> so you're not a residents fan?
[1:29:29] <Ethel9727> That leads to the question: Pat would you become a giant eyeball in exchange for immortality?
[1:29:29] <Explodincatz> what if Jack had the same idea?
[1:29:30] <+coffeebearCafe> dog broken
[1:29:31] <MisterCrimson> sarpatstic
[1:29:32] <$realm_forge> Pats logo is literally his a targetable weak spot
[1:29:33] <Mattais88> There's no law on the internet
[1:29:34] <+A_Fistful_of_Bees> There are no laws in Canada
[1:29:35] <choocheess> no it's because you're a huge neversoft fan
[1:29:39] <%CzeekyTV> This stream sponsored by Capcom's lawyers.
[1:29:39] <%ironohki> Party Room!
[1:29:43] <cheapdoc> Nothing to say for legal purposes except "in my opinion"
[1:29:46] <spongeofmystery> Something something Bloodborne joke about eyes
[1:29:47] <choocheess> and loved the tony hawk series of the aughts
[1:29:52] <Wydamn> Jack has a slimy eye, Pat's eye logo looks quite healthy.
[1:29:52] <Aydarkzero> that was cool
[1:29:53] <%ironohki> Party Mead Hall?
[1:29:54] <kite1haseo> Reminds me of the neversoft logo
[1:30:12] <dekkitout> Sudden intrusion from offscreen is the best
[1:30:13] <%TheWinged7> sait sord
[1:30:13] <%RealThiele> Blizzard is a rapey company . . .  allegedly
[1:30:21] <%Frost_Quill> @Wydamn He has a septic eye.  It's a real thing.
[1:30:27] <+Monograxo> pat dropped the name because gief is angrier than him
[1:30:28] <TheReallJimbo> TheReallJimbo subscribed with Prime. 
[1:30:30] <yeildingthought> I thought it was a reference to the neversoft logo Kappa
[1:30:32] <%LeiaSkynoober> The spin is so cool
[1:30:37] <%hrbeck_> Also Pat's logo isn't just an eye, it's an eye with his name on it- big deal legally
[1:30:45] <Wydamn> @Frost_Quill, more youtube money than god, and he still can't get that looked at.
[1:30:52] <%BoxNavy> fuck you fake jimbo

[1:31:09] <%TheReallJimbo> "that bitch!" haha!
[1:31:14] <Too_Much_Nukie> I modded Dark Souls 1 myself to rename the Uchiganata to Sasuke Uchiha.
[1:31:14] <%Issun135> gotta get those repair powders or repair spell bd durability is extra low in this mod
[1:31:18] <BliVru> if you wanna know the best Katana weapon in the game is the Makoto
[1:31:21] <TerrifyingRei_05> is anyone else's video stuttering every now and then? it just jumps forwards
[1:31:21] <Krash_Override> Industry Baby is great
[1:31:28] <BigFingerRo> Here's your starter pack for critical gamer YT channel: "Angry" in the name, "gamer/gaming" at the end, several mainstream game, mascot that scowls, maybe based on you
[1:31:35] <%Broand> Rogue water, water for rogues
[1:31:42] <cheapdoc> Huh, the chainmail actually jingles, I never noticed, never war it
[1:31:43] <Too_Much_Nukie> The Rakuyo is also cool but only if you're playing 1.82 and have the moveset mod.
[1:31:53] <DianaTheAscian> yeah
[1:31:59] <BigFingerRo> @Broand Oooo , can I buy a subscription for that?
[1:32:05] <+fetrigon> ye

[1:32:17] <MrDrayko> There are so many songs that turn to shit halfway through
[1:32:17] <%TheReallJimbo> rap songs are like shareware games
[1:32:18] <%flying_hipp0> wut?
[1:32:18] <+Damie904> That's called a hook, which...yea that's kinda the point. And completely fair on your part.

[1:32:50] <AoiRob> why is he baby sized
[1:32:50] <+fetrigon> holy shit that tracking
[1:32:50] <Too_Much_Nukie> gotem
[1:32:50] <+coffeebearCafe> paiges best friend
[1:32:50] <+redthebaron> he is so tiny
[1:32:51] <+Demenequie> it even tracks like dark souls 2
[1:32:53] <+Monograxo> pursuer cosplayer
[1:32:55] <ohkayNiko> tiny purse user
[1:32:56] <%crimsonharvest> like when vanilla ice says 'to the extreme i rock a like mike a vandal' or whatever its in the first half of the first verse or something
[1:32:58] <%RealThiele> get nae nae'd
[1:33:01] <AstrodropGaming> Pursurer Jnr.
[1:33:02] <%TheReallJimbo> gotee
[1:33:03] <%Frost_Quill> I liked how in DS2 the Persuer floated.
[1:33:06] <Profmcstevie> Pursuer lite, for mobile
[1:33:09] <%Broand> Pursuer 5 is my favourite atlus game
[1:33:09] <%W1nterTitan> How could my purser possibly be this cute?
[1:33:09] <AoiRob> did you save greirat
[1:33:11] <%CollinsOfBodom> that was not the pursuer I was expecting
[1:33:28] <ohkayNiko> same
[1:33:29] <+CookieCutter007> OOOOOOOHHHHHHH
[1:33:33] <cheapdoc> Pursuer? more like Pee sewer
[1:33:43] <+tinytinykittycat> looks real purty too
[1:33:55] <+fetrigon> is there new gameplay footage out yet
[1:34:03] <Too_Much_Nukie> I'm trying to keep my expectations realistic for Elden Ring.
[1:34:05] <+Monograxo> is there a reason for pursuer not being the one from ds2? they added solaire just fine so its not a copyright problem right?
[1:34:10] <%BoxNavy> :)
[1:34:10] <%Frost_Quill> Blandai.
[1:34:12] <%Dakuu75> @PatStaresAt what was that large-large Katana you picked up, early in this playthrough? (I can't find it, via google)
[1:34:15] <%someyounguy1> the namcops are a whole other thing tho
[1:34:19] <$TallYoda08> atpGasm saved
[1:34:22] <cheapdoc> did they have more time to make the game this time too?
[1:34:23] <$sylphyyyy> LUL
[1:34:28] <Arancet> yeah, because japanese companies don't have sexual harrassment
[1:34:28] <Profmcstevie> God it's the worst part of Sekiro knowing Activision in any way hang over it
[1:34:34] <blackjack8182> bland?
[1:34:35] <$sylphyyyy> chunky boooooi
[1:34:37] <Ethel9727> @monograxo It's harder to build a boss than it is to just add a npc with the weapon
[1:34:39] <%Frost_Quill> @Dakuu75 Alonne's sword.
[1:34:40] <Wydamn> Zangrief
[1:34:41] <%AgniBrandt> @Dakuu75 Probably washing pole
[1:34:45] <%Monkeyweed21> @Dakuu75 Alonne's Katana from DS2
[1:34:46] <omglaserbeamspewpew> Zangief, no spinning piledriver! Bad!
[1:34:47] <homestylewaffles> @Monograxo It was probably just easier to add him as a red phantom considering that's all pre-existing
[1:34:50] <fugly_nick> Good grief Zangief
[1:34:50] <%Treasure_Vault> @Dakuu75 The Bewitched Alonne sword where Gundyr wasn't?
[1:34:50] <%moonmintparadise> psaDogchamp
[1:34:51] <Wydamn> Zangrief is griefing
[1:34:51] <%RealThiele> the normal amount of japanese workplace misogyny
[1:34:51] <dekkitout> To think Gief would smack controllers outta hands in the middle of a set
[1:34:52] <KosOrSomeSayKosm_> piggo boy
[1:34:57] <+upandadam> based namco
[1:34:57] <+Sepdep> BEEG BABY
[1:35:01] <AoiRob> his punishment is hugs and kissies
[1:35:03] <%MechArch> psaGiefrail psaGiefrail psaGiefrail psaGiefrail psaGiefrail
[1:35:10] <Profmcstevie> Gief would definitely rage quit and throw a controller
[1:35:12] <%AzureGale> Gief is so happy rn
[1:35:13] <%Dakuu75> Yeah, that was it "Alonne Sword" thanks
[1:35:15] <+Monograxo> ah I see
[1:35:21] <+Shady_Zaku> bamco
[1:35:23] <%MechArch> butt baby
[1:35:30] <mandorlalmond> same dna
[1:35:30] <Ethel9727> I thought you only gave birth to Elmo?
[1:35:37] <Too_Much_Nukie> It's because the Pursuer's float physics would require rebuilding.
[1:35:41] <AoiRob> holy poise boi
[1:35:44] <%HaroldDonchee> my child.. the fucking asshole
[1:35:48] <Too_Much_Nukie> Nothing in DS3 moves like he did so you'd have to make it from scratch.
[1:35:50] <thunka10> yeah LUL
[1:35:51] <BigFingerRo> HE GROWS RAMBUNCTIOUS
[1:35:55] <%TheReallJimbo> with DS2 overhead tracking too
[1:35:57] <Aydarkzero> Pursuer ded
[1:36:09] <KosOrSomeSayKosm_> huh, his greatsword drops, very nice
[1:36:19] <%TheReallJimbo> now do it 13 more times throughout the game
[1:36:23] <BigFingerRo> STAB THE FATTY
[1:36:30] <insomniac_doze_> i hate pursuer so much
[1:36:35] <Too_Much_Nukie> tfw you kill Pursuer and he doesn't drop his armor or shield so you know he'll come back.
[1:36:35] <%KeiganOfAstora> @PatStaresAt Put your box in the top right so we can see your soul count?
[1:36:42] <%Dakuu75> (oh, the "Alonne Sword" is only is ds3 because of the mod. Damn.)
[1:36:54] <+Monograxo> the real question is, did they add 26 forlorn invasions as well?
[1:36:57] <softbirby> are you a bad enough dude to fight the dancer early?
[1:37:03] <dekkitout> Friend-shaped catcher's mit
[1:37:06] <%Agami23> hey, do you still regen FP in this?
[1:37:10] <%MechArch> psaGoblin
[1:37:11] <Ethel9727> Pat doesn't like being in the upper right corner because it makes him look tall
[1:37:11] <Profmcstevie> Is this a ploy for stream interaction, covering up HUD elements
[1:37:13] <%HaroldDonchee> not used to being so high up
[1:37:14] <%Frost_Quill> bark
[1:37:14] <Too_Much_Nukie> There is ONE forlorn invasion.
[1:37:14] <%Broand> Not used to being in high places
[1:37:18] <%KeiganOfAstora> Interesting
[1:37:20] <Too_Much_Nukie> Yeah you still regen FP in this.
[1:37:21] <%moonmintparadise> yeah bc you just look into nowhere
[1:37:22] <ChatNinja> What about lifting it just above the souls?
[1:37:22] <KosOrSomeSayKosm_> pat's irrational fear of being right strikes again
[1:37:23] <DanThePumpkinman> are you not used to being that high up?
[1:37:24] <%SuckerPunchSyd> Too tall
[1:37:26] <blackmageslowpoke> Good ring
[1:37:27] <%Monkeyweed21> Alt-Lib Pat
[1:37:29] <%TheReallJimbo> you could put pat in the lower left, like he's a spell
[1:37:34] <+Dova573> What are you and Gief debating?
[1:37:36] <Krash_Override> oh yeah, you get invaded by a LOT of NPC's in this mod
[1:37:36] <+redthebaron> everyone is here
[1:37:38] <homestylewaffles> hahaaa l i g h t n i n g z w e i h a n d e r
[1:37:46] <Madinki> Are you not used to being so high up?
[1:37:51] <%RealThiele> mushroom man?
[1:37:52] <%Dakuu75> Captain Fuck-up-your-day
[1:37:52] <dekkitout> Our eyes prioritize the lower half of the screen, then the left
[1:37:53] <blue8moon> Lothric Knight Captain I guess?"
[1:37:56] <+ClericOfSparda> Wow, big mad!
[1:37:56] <BliVru> ITS AN OC LOOK OUT!
[1:38:13] <%BoxNavy> zangief monkaS
[1:38:13] <Too_Much_Nukie> Morrel fights like an asshole.
[1:38:20] <Madinki> OP OC COMING IN HOT
[1:38:21] <mr_saturday93> nice!
[1:38:29] <Ethel9727> The mod-added invasions also are changed slightly for ease of use. They wont lock you from boning/sitting at a bonfire and don't require ember
[1:38:32] <fugly_nick> BLOODBORNE RING
[1:38:35] <+tussletoes> godspeed morrel
[1:38:35] <%someyounguy1> oh its the bloodborne dodge
[1:38:43] <secret_npc> Hey I got a notification saying this was an ME3 stream, but it looks like you're playing some indie game
[1:38:45] <+ghostfaceninja_> trickster
[1:38:47] <choocheess> @someyounguy1 :O
[1:38:51] <%Monkeyweed21> oh thats broken
[1:38:54] <Thesomeone96> thats the twin dagger skill
[1:38:59] <%ironohki> I legit love that trap.
[1:39:02] <Ethel9727> Some of the Bloodborne weapons  actually change the quickstep animation to the Bloodborne dash
[1:39:03] <BlockingDisabled> uuh oh
[1:39:06] <%Monkeyweed21> thats a free quickstep
[1:39:11] <Explodincatz> tiiing
[1:39:14] <homestylewaffles> it's the dagger quickstep but dramatically buffed
[1:39:19] <Madinki> @secret_npc Yeah it's pretty ambitious this indie game
[1:39:22] <+Shady_Zaku> lmao
[1:39:24] <Profmcstevie> fat baby gonna crush his mom out of love
[1:39:24] <%sileo_patronus> Does cinder's still have that weird FP regen thing?
[1:39:26] <homestylewaffles> lots more iframes
[1:39:27] <Aydarkzero> that swamp stands no chance now
[1:39:39] <fugly_nick> Holy shit this mod is like 8 gigs
[1:40:02] <%Dakuu75> lol
[1:40:04] <%sileo_patronus> @fugly_nick Yeah that's big DS3 mods for you
[1:40:08] <dekkitout> Overhaul mods tend to be like that
[1:40:09] <psidefx> Its dat boi parton
[1:40:10] <Too_Much_Nukie> FP regen is like the basis for all of Cinders.
[1:40:23] <BliVru> Dont say stolen
[1:40:25] <+tussletoes> dragon bone smasher is back baybee
[1:40:26] <fugly_nick> yeah the models file is 5 Gb by itself
[1:40:31] <+rafaelba93> and bloodborne
[1:40:37] <BliVru> right...
[1:40:38] <%crimsonharvest> exfiltrated
[1:40:39] <+CookieCutter007> inspired
[1:40:41] <Profmcstevie> uplifted
[1:40:42] <beard__0> Can you powerstance in this game?
[1:40:44] <%BoxNavy> ripstolen
[1:40:45] <TheAntiNihilist> Any Sekiro stuff?
[1:40:47] <dekkitout> Utilized
[1:40:52] <homestylewaffles> liberated
[1:40:53] <%RealThiele> Swolen
[1:40:54] <Explodincatz> relocated
[1:40:54] <%TheReallJimbo> "borrowed"
[1:40:56] <KosOrSomeSayKosm_> @TheAntiNihilist ye
[1:40:58] <+ChocolateMoofin> what's stolen?
[1:40:59] <Madinki> Stol-ripped
[1:41:00] <$realm_forge> Creatively updated
[1:41:02] <dekkitout> Emancipated
[1:41:03] <MarvelousMrD> culturally appropriated
[1:41:04] <+animaturgy> @PatStaresAt Did you need to download the setup files to update?
[1:41:05] <+Darky04> "Repurposed"
[1:41:06] <Too_Much_Nukie> There is no power stance in Cinders. If you want power stance stuff in DS3 play Champions of Ash.
[1:41:07] <%sileo_patronus> @beard__0 Try Champion's ashes if you want powerstance
[1:41:08] <+rafaelba93> criatively reused
[1:41:13] <%TheReallJimbo> you wouldn't steal a house
[1:41:18] <%HaroldDonchee> yoinked
[1:41:18] <BliVru> Stolen is a mean word we used instead...
[1:41:24] <+animaturgy> Ah, cheers!
[1:41:25] <+Monograxo> i'm glad from isn't a shit about that
[1:41:34] <Jrocy247> It's VERY easy to install
[1:41:45] <%RealThiele> just dump it right in
[1:41:59] <%sileo_patronus> That's a good combo
[1:42:02] <+rafaelba93> github download kept failing so i got it from the nexus
[1:42:04] <+ChocolateMoofin> @PatStaresAt  is this randomized?
[1:42:11] <%dethsenvoy01> Strategically Transport Equipment to an Alternate Location.       or S.T.E.A.L
[1:42:16] <Too_Much_Nukie> @Monograxo I mean they're a shit in that they don't support the mod community at all and treat them as hackers. But they don't notice or care about model ripping.
[1:42:17] <Ethel9727> The new movesets are ALL so cool
[1:42:19] <Profmcstevie> You....don't move right in some of those swings, like you got cement shoes
[1:42:19] <homestylewaffles> @ChocolateMoofin no
[1:42:21] <BliVru> Some of the halberds have you movesets too
[1:42:22] <%Paperware> Weapon art is also sligtly different
[1:42:22] <%W1nterTitan> Does the Pan make a TF2 sound when it hits?
[1:42:26] <+Essixian> It always had the up-down
[1:42:27] <dekkitout> Mods tend to be either download a 7zip than copy paste into a file in the game folder- or click install with a mod organizew
[1:42:27] <fugly_nick> @ChocolateMoofin By itself, this mod isn't, but it does support the randomizer
[1:42:27] <Ethel9727> The Penetrator Sword has such a cool moveset
[1:42:28] <%ironohki> A little of the ol' up and down.
[1:42:29] <%Dakuu75> they gave it updog?
[1:42:33] <+montymole445> i love when it gets the updog
[1:42:35] <%sileo_patronus> @PatStaresAt what's updown?
[1:42:37] <BliVru> i meant new movesets
[1:42:39] <%Issun135> i think BKGS is unchanged in move set
[1:42:49] <+Essixian> @PatStaresAt The BKGS always had the up-down
[1:42:56] <%ironohki> @Dakuu75 What is updog, @Dakuu75? Please, tell me what is updog?
[1:42:58] <+megaman_sentinel> thats the ds1
[1:42:59] <Wydamn> @sileo_patronus, not much, what's up with you?
[1:43:00] <%Dakuu75> @PatStaresAt so it has updog now?
[1:43:16] <+Monograxo> I guess because of the online components they have to do that, still, not taking the thing down is enough for them to not be assholes in my book
[1:43:20] <+shadowsvrse> hey pat missed you you smol ginger fuck <3
[1:43:20] <%ironohki> ...I will be alert for this updog.
[1:43:22] <%MechArch> that very late swing
[1:43:26] <%SWFanatic> SWFanatic subscribed with Prime. They've subscribed for 25 months! Thats the do it. Big and strong. Oh wrong stream. Sorry. Gettem big stumbo!
[1:43:29] <Too_Much_Nukie> Those support clerics are THE FUCKING WORST in Lothric's castle.
[1:43:30] <%Issun135> i def know vordts hammer is real good
[1:43:31] <%Dakuu75> doodScrub psaMenace psaMenace psaMenace psaMenace psaMenace
[1:43:32] <Laecerelius> bad trade
[1:43:37] <+Shady_Zaku> oof
[1:43:44] <BliVru> Are gonna go for Dancer now?
[1:43:44] <Too_Much_Nukie> @PatStaresAt Are you going to fight Dancer early?
[1:43:53] <+Sir_Gawain_Lotsson> Geef
[1:43:54] <%MechArch> psaDogchamp
[1:43:55] <%sileo_patronus> Is the Uchi's weapon art still Hold?
[1:43:57] <insomniac_doze_> can you play online with this mod?
[1:44:05] <Too_Much_Nukie> Dancer in this mod had their damage changed.
[1:44:11] <%sileo_patronus> @insomniac_doze_ On the banned server
[1:44:11] <Too_Much_Nukie> And her weapon is much better.
[1:44:20] <cheapdoc> You know you're getting old when you take a shit so hard, it sprains your back
[1:44:23] <BliVru> You can get to the Archives earlier too you get the key right away
[1:44:41] <Too_Much_Nukie> Pat has the master key.
[1:44:46] <Too_Much_Nukie> Master key in this opens ALL locks.
[1:44:51] <%Nordguy> family sharings account?
[1:45:07] <%HaroldDonchee> he's embracing the slob
[1:45:08] <%sileo_patronus> @Nordguy SteamFamily Share
[1:45:14] <%Dakuu75> he's living his best life
[1:45:15] <Too_Much_Nukie> Steam feature for making accounts for children/significant others.
[1:45:16] <+Monograxo> steam family share, it lets you play "borrowed" games
[1:45:16] <MrDrayko> giwtwm
[1:45:19] <+megaman_sentinel> just no
[1:45:27] <BliVru> He will soon evolve into a Butterfly
[1:45:27] <Wydamn> All those years of getting hueg have come back to haunt you in dog form
[1:45:33] <+AnActualHermitCrab> Zangief looks like every moment of existence for him is pain, and I just find that really cute.
[1:45:40] <%Nordguy> ill take a googling, thank you @sileo_patronus
[1:45:46] <Profmcstevie> Whenever I hear "but why" I always go to zoolander "but why male models" LUL
[1:45:49] <+ChocolateMoofin> Can you imagine having Sephiroth's blade here?
[1:45:52] <fugly_nick> I'm curious what kind of new shit mages can do
[1:46:02] <+rafaelba93> i used it with my friends
[1:46:07] <%SWFanatic> @AnActualHermitCrab "She took the kids." -Zangief probably
[1:46:11] <dekkitout> @fugly_nick Check out his first cinders run
[1:46:17] <Too_Much_Nukie> @ChocolateMoofin I mean the Bewitched Alonne Blade is basically Sephiroth's sword.
[1:46:19] <KosOrSomeSayKosm_> mages are actually playable now
[1:46:20] <Krash_Override> yeah playing as a mage is easy mod
[1:46:21] <Krash_Override> mode
[1:46:32] <cheapdoc> I did a miracle HP regeneration run, equally as busted
[1:46:35] <BliVru> @patstaresat They nerfed Mages because of YOU
[1:46:36] <%crimsonharvest> all dogs are disgusting so what can you do
[1:46:46] <TerrifyingRei_05> on a scale of 1 to 10, how disgustingly busted is it?
[1:46:47] <$Ziegsy> he learned it from YOU
[1:46:47] <%HaroldDonchee> dogs mimic their owners
[1:46:50] <Too_Much_Nukie> They explicitly nerfed mages because of that run Pat.
[1:46:51] <Too_Much_Nukie> LUL
[1:46:55] <Profmcstevie> they ARE a reflection of their owners as they say
[1:47:10] <%ironohki> Pat: become orb. Geif: Become orb like father.
[1:47:11] <%Movemeister> They taught him wrong, as a joke
[1:47:12] <BooitsDock> why did you teach your dog to give other dogs blow jobs Kappa
[1:47:16] <%SWFanatic> Mmmmmm Meeeeee
[1:47:17] <lethallylactic> LUL
[1:47:21] <Too_Much_Nukie> Hex builds are still pretty busted but mages aren't as OP as they were.
[1:47:23] <BliVru> They were so salty for you
[1:47:25] <%TheReallJimbo> is he blind, sucking down mustard AND mouth-breathing?
[1:47:28] <dekkitout> We can correlate the update dates to your lp
[1:47:29] <cheapdoc> Instead of reflecting upon themselves, they blamed the beasts
[1:47:30] <+tussletoes> I believe it.
[1:47:32] <%ironohki> @SWFanatic Mmmmmeeeeeeeeeee
[1:47:35] <Profmcstevie> Changelog: Fucking Pat, this mage stuffs getting fucked
[1:47:41] <athuramn> is this vanilla or is there something like cinders?
[1:47:41] <+ChocolateMoofin> is this crazy talk?
[1:47:45] <total_overkill> @TheReallJimbo 2 outa 3
[1:47:47] <Ethel9727> To be fair, "Because fuck pat" is pretty reasonable logic
[1:47:47] <Wydamn> "We nerfed mages because Pat's run was so disgusting"
[1:47:48] <%RealThiele> i want a changelog that says because fuck pat
[1:47:48] <%SWFanatic> oh i misspelled it
[1:47:51] <%ironohki> @tussletoes Habeeb it.
[1:47:54] <Too_Much_Nukie> It's on the nexus forums Pat.
[1:47:56] <Jolly_Adventurer> Changelog: "Fuck Pat"
[1:47:56] <%SWFanatic> big coward
[1:47:59] <Profmcstevie> Honestly if a changelog cited an individual player or streamer that'd be a hoot
[1:48:00] <%ironohki> TWINKY HOUSE.
[1:48:01] <critiquequartz> Let’s find the log
[1:48:05] <DianaTheAscian> @athuramn it is cinders
[1:48:05] <%WhereIsWill> that was a clean dodge psaDab
[1:48:19] <athuramn> @dianatheascian thank you <:
[1:48:20] <cheapdoc> To be fair, you're way fucking stronger
[1:48:25] <+tussletoes> wait WHY did they add lifegems lmao
[1:48:28] <DanThePumpkinman> what game was it that did get patched to fuck pat? i feel like it was an fps of some sort
[1:48:33] <TerrifyingRei_05> is this Arno Londo?
[1:48:44] <athuramn> oh I'm so dumb it's right there in the title :x
[1:48:46] <$Ziegsy> pat@Im gonna take this ring off. Paige: :U
[1:48:51] <Profmcstevie> Pat helped a New Blood game get a bug fixed cos he played it on pad
[1:48:53] <Too_Much_Nukie> @tussletoes Because enemy damage is significantly buffed and lifegems aren't given for fucking free like in DS2.
[1:49:00] <+Sir_Gawain_Lotsson> NICE damage
[1:49:00] <Too_Much_Nukie> So lifegems are a way to heal between fights.
[1:49:02] <%BoxNavy> SourPls
[1:49:03] <%ironohki> @TerrifyingRei_05 This is not Anor Londo.
[1:49:06] <cheapdoc> @TerrifyingRei_05 No, it's Lonno Ardo
[1:49:07] <insomniac_doze_> dex DansGame

[1:49:35] <%Cykron> Cykron subscribed at Tier 1. They've subscribed for 11 months! Hey Pat, just beat Shadowbringers! I think it had a bittersweet and thoughtful ending like a good Final Fantasy game should. Only a crazy person wouldn't appreciate the motives of such a well written primary villain like that! Thanks for recommending it.
[1:49:38] <%RealThiele> whatever. . .
[1:49:45] <fugly_nick> get right up in that ass

[1:49:51] <%WhereIsWill> oh noooo
[1:49:52] <Too_Much_Nukie> @tussletoes After you reach Undead Settlement almost no enemies drop them ever. So you have to buy them after the early game.
[1:49:56] <%weissguard> Damn, Dancer double cheeked up.
[1:49:57] <%RealThiele> BITCH
[1:49:59] <dekkitout> "hit like a fuckin' wet noodlw!"

[1:50:12] <Wydamn> Too early, dancer woke up grumpy
[1:50:12] <Too_Much_Nukie> THIS BITCH DOUBLE CHEEKED UP ON A FRIDAY EVENING
[1:50:14] <TheFramedWarlock> LUL
[1:50:15] <blue8moon> This is why everyone explicitly told paige not to kill the old lady when she first met her LUL
[1:50:16] <+tussletoes> @Too_Much_Nukie okay good, glad they're not as trivial as 2
[1:50:17] <%Romuken> @PatStaresAt playing PoE II.  Got mods to help me wanna complete it but still hard to do.  Found that I like playing it when in a discord call for some reason.  Is this how the want for streaming starts?  I'm scared.
[1:50:18] <fugly_nick> Should have put more points into luck
[1:50:21] <dekkitout> @SWFanatic Team Longback
[1:50:26] <KosOrSomeSayKosm_> I remember doing the dancer early in cinders a year ago, thus making me able to have the moonlight GS for the entire run, it was great
[1:50:27] <+bokchoy__> nice bonfire
[1:50:28] <tanarath> Pat, why did you go unga bunga?
[1:50:31] <%RealThiele> HECKLE HIM PAIGE
[1:50:31] <%Pappajimbo> twerked to death
[1:50:31] <Too_Much_Nukie> Git gud scrub.
[1:50:39] <%Byronic_dreamer> Byronic_dreamer subscribed at Tier 1. They've subscribed for 5 months! just popped in and I haven't yet watched any of the Cinders streams, give me the quick rundown of what the mod do?
[1:50:43] <%ElkRiverDog> Paige show him how it’s done
[1:50:48] <%ironohki> @tanarath You need to bunga if you want to unga.
[1:50:48] <%Broand> Lightning miracles.... could they finally be good?
[1:50:49] <%SWFanatic> bleed that booty
[1:50:52] <cheapdoc> The dancer is the classiest boss, I swear
[1:50:58] <Too_Much_Nukie> @Byronic_dreamer There is no quick rundown lol. It changes everything.
[1:50:59] <dekkitout> Big big big overhaul
[1:50:59] <%TheReallJimbo> go to Vordt first, get his hammer. we all know how OP that hammer be
[1:51:04] <%ironohki> E V E R Y T H I N G
[1:51:09] <+Shady_Zaku> R34
[1:51:12] <+Dova573> Where those steps sound effects always there?
[1:51:12] <Jetsfantasy> @Byronic_dreamer Imports stuff from other DS games including Sekiro and DeS and is a complete DS3 overhaul
[1:51:20] <Too_Much_Nukie> Her grab will instakill you at your level btw Pat.
[1:51:22] <%Romuken> @Byronic_dreamer changes the bosses, overhaul on all items I believe, new classes... what ironohki said.  EVERYTHING
[1:51:25] <%SWFanatic> I just think shes neat
[1:51:27] <$realm_forge> Was the dancer actually Gwinavere or was that just a rumor?
[1:51:31] <fugly_nick> I haven't fought this boss in years, but I super remember that grab
[1:51:32] <DanThePumpkinman> creeps me out how she's crouched all the time
[1:51:32] <%sileo_patronus> Dancer actually does surprisingly little damage for how late you fight her without doing it this way
[1:51:32] <%Romuken> And what Jetsfantasy said
[1:51:38] <%Issun135> it was a shame her swords are bad
[1:51:41] <Too_Much_Nukie> That was just a rumor.
[1:51:44] <%SWFanatic> spin to win
[1:51:44] <Too_Much_Nukie> Dancer was a girl.
[1:51:45] <cheapdoc> SPIN TO WIN
[1:51:48] <%coward_man> SPEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEN
[1:51:48] <Krash_Override> and she became a Beyblade
[1:51:49] <%WhereIsWill> good effort
[1:51:50] <Laecerelius> SPEEEEEN!
[1:51:50] <%RealThiele> this is more like Fromsoft Allstars 3 (not you armored core)
[1:51:51] <%Romuken> @realm_forge booba too smol?
[1:51:52] <Too_Much_Nukie> Or is a girl.
[1:51:55] <cheapdoc> ALL THE WAY TO GOLDLEWIS DICKENSON
[1:52:06] <%SWFanatic> try spinning thats a good trick
[1:52:06] <Ekaelis> Dancer grows more aggressive the more you hit on her
[1:52:07] <tanarath> Pat, you better gotta stay in her safe spot
[1:52:07] <Aydarkzero> ye
[1:52:08] <%sileo_patronus> Boy I wanna get a babe laid
[1:52:09] <%BoxNavy> no
[1:52:09] <ExpressNode> Let it rip
[1:52:11] <TheFramedWarlock> In This Dancer Typhoon
[1:52:13] <cheapdoc> In this behemoth typhon
[1:52:13] <Slimeking_Mike> yea probly
[1:52:14] <fugly_nick> Just don't get hit
[1:52:17] <Profmcstevie> Beyblade Valley Dancer
[1:52:17] <fugly_nick> ever
[1:52:18] <%ironohki> @RealThiele I could vividly imagine the sad mech taking his ball and going home.
[1:52:19] <%Monkeyweed21> no
[1:52:24] <KosOrSomeSayKosm_> may the moonlight guide you PAt
[1:52:28] <%coward_man> let er rip
[1:52:31] <%NateyBeak> just ask her nicely
[1:52:33] <%Broand> does this mod auto disable online is the real question
[1:52:36] <Wydamn> If you got to phase 2 on your second try, I bet you could
[1:52:37] <Too_Much_Nukie> @PatStaresAt I stubbornly fought Dancer all day in Cinders recently and got so good at timing her attacks I could perfect block everything in phase 1 without thinking. Don't do that on stream.
[1:52:37] <ExpressNode> Dancer of the beyblade valley
[1:52:37] <%Issun135> i think pat will be able to get really close and then get grabbed at the end
[1:52:39] <%TheReallJimbo> Pat can do it. he's strong
[1:52:45] <%RealThiele> @RealThiele LUL god i miss armored core
[1:52:47] <blue8moon> just don't get hit
[1:52:49] <%vandastelka> No too early
[1:52:51] <%BoxNavy> OH NOO
[1:52:52] <$Ziegsy> Some kid atmy school glued razors to his beyblade. when we pointed out it wouldnt wort on other beyblades, he said it was for the opponent.
[1:52:52] <Aydarkzero> command grab LUL
[1:52:55] <%Romuken> smayush

[1:52:59] <Aydarkzero> it looked cool though
[1:53:00] <%WhereIsWill> rekt LUL
[1:53:00] <%coward_man> oh no! But cool though!
[1:53:00] <fairore> wow
[1:53:00] <CrimsonFox777> I imagine it'd have to disable it, just so you don't connect to vanilla players.
[1:53:02] <+fetrigon> oof
[1:53:02] <%someyounguy1> thats a sick grab. i havent seen that in a long time
[1:53:03] <$realm_forge> @romuken I heard Sullivan corrupted her and her current state is the result of the same cursed ring that abort had
[1:53:03] <cheapdoc> That was very Elden Ring
[1:53:04] <dekkitout> W A S T E D
[1:53:04] <%Issun135> yo called ut
[1:53:05] <Ekaelis> wrong way Pat LUL
[1:53:06] <+shadowsvrse> try the dash see how that favors
[1:53:06] <%ironohki> Dancer is such a cool design.
[1:53:07] <%Broand> Thanks pat I'm glad you could come to grips
[1:53:08] <%W1nterTitan> She's so cool
[1:53:08] <%RealThiele> yeet
[1:53:10] <insomniac_doze_> f
[1:53:12] <fugly_nick> That wouldn't have happened if you put points into luck
[1:53:18] <%HairballCT> lytKILLGOKU NO OTHER OPTIONS lytKILLGOKU
[1:53:22] <%sileo_patronus> Got hit with the Irithyll Buster
[1:53:22] <%TheReallJimbo> what happun?
[1:53:26] <%Romuken> Interesting, didn't think about that! @realm_forge no idea then.
[1:53:35] <%Monkeyweed21> PAT YOU HAD A 66 AND 2/3RDS PERCENT OF WINNING
[1:53:43] <%WhereIsWill> is that just a pyro combustion?
[1:53:44] <%sileo_patronus> That running attack is so cool
[1:53:47] <KosOrSomeSayKosm_> that's Irithyl's ass
[1:53:49] <Slimeking_Mike> Bordt's a Vitch
[1:53:49] <$Ziegsy> Vordts like; 'Hey man, Ive been subbed for years, what the hell?'
[1:53:57] <%BoxNavy> yes
[1:53:58] <%ironohki> Hey Chat, anyone see Ymfah beat Vordt in one hit?
[1:53:58] <%big_boss_baby> repeating of course
[1:53:59] <AoG_JarlRaven> Is tonight retro gaming night?
[1:54:01] <AoG_JarlRaven> Kappa
[1:54:03] <%cha0tic_klutch> THE NUMBERS DONT LIE
[1:54:06] <ExpressNode> Let's make that zero
[1:54:09] <%RealThiele> no.
[1:54:11] <Krash_Override> @PatStaresAt if you believe in Steiner Math, you can do it!
[1:54:14] <%Monkeyweed21> YOU'RE A GENETIC FREAK
[1:54:20] <psidefx> Because the dancer KNOWS she can't beat Pat so shes not even gonna try
[1:54:21] <dekkitout> Yes. That's what happens when you add uchigatana to the mix
[1:54:23] <%TheReallJimbo> no hit this boss. do it like Hob!
[1:54:24] <Too_Much_Nukie> The description for Dancer's armor mentions that Dancer used to be royalty and then she turned beast-like due to the pontiff's rings.
[1:54:27] <%cha0tic_klutch> YOURE NOT NORMAL
[1:54:28] <%Monkeyweed21> SAMOA JOE KNOWS HE CANT LINK THE FIRST FLAME
[1:54:28] <%baronblank> pat was not a genetic freak this time
[1:54:29] <cheapdoc> You have a Raver's dance of a chance of winning
[1:54:29] <$Ziegsy> @AoG_JarlRaven 100 hp psychic damage
[1:54:30] <%HaroldDonchee> imagine how beefy your calves would be walking around like that all the time
[1:54:30] <fugly_nick> This kinda looks like the room where you fight Dragonslayer in DS2
[1:54:31] <Madinki> SAMOA JOE! SENIOR JOE! THE NUMBERS DON'T LIE
[1:54:34] <fnjohnboy> I mean compared to my 13 and a half percent.....
[1:54:36] <%Jack_of_No_Trades> Dancer is one of the coolest bosses Ive seen
[1:54:46] <%Romuken> ...got a friend wanting me to help find someone to sell some Buckaroo Banzai and some old af star wars stuff, unsure what do
[1:54:47] <%ironohki> @Too_Much_Nukie Pontiff is like, actually the cause of all the problems, I think.
[1:54:50] <%RealThiele> cumback to her
[1:54:51] <Too_Much_Nukie> @HaroldDonchee Is that why Dancer is thicc?
[1:55:01] <thebehatted> always have a hard time memorizing her moveset
[1:55:05] <Too_Much_Nukie> @ironohki At least most of them yeah. He's the Seethe of this game.
[1:55:10] <Madinki> AT SACRIFICE SAMOA (SENIOR?) JOE!
[1:55:10] <%big_boss_baby> Yeah, Suly fucked em
[1:55:15] <cheapdoc> I CAN'T WAIT FOR ELDEN RING
[1:55:16] <$realm_forge> Ah Ha!
[1:55:17] <Ethel9727> #PontiffDidNothingWrong
[1:55:25] <%coward_man> isn't it implied somewhere that Dancer is Gwynaviere's daughter?
[1:55:26] <fugly_nick> Didn't you tell Woolie in the DS2 LP not to use lifegems in boss fights?
[1:55:28] <+Fooguwu> she was also forced to dance for Pontiff Sullivan
[1:55:30] <%thedankestmeeme> she gotta dump truck der
[1:55:33] <%ironohki> @Too_Much_Nukie I really loved learning to repost-fuck him.
[1:55:35] <cheapdoc> Pat, remember Contact Mic
[1:55:39] <Srthunda> My favorite detail of this boss is the arena getting set on fire
[1:55:40] <%Monkeyweed21> yea Outrider knights eventually turn into the dog monsters in Irithyll
[1:55:41] <Ethel9727> Pontiff is a hero, just like Light
[1:55:44] <TerrifyingRei_05> literally evei
[1:55:49] <Too_Much_Nukie> Dancer was originally a princess, then she became a dancer for the army, then a knight for the army.
[1:55:50] <%big_boss_baby> Suly made Vordt thicc
[1:55:52] <%TheDullaMAN> Pontiff Saliva-n
[1:55:55] <AoiRob> pontiff is like the actual main villain of ds3
[1:55:58] <Too_Much_Nukie> Pontiff is basically Hitler.
[1:56:01] <Profmcstevie> Pontiff is Griffiths idol and mentor
[1:56:04] <dekkitout> See chat, the numbers don't lie, Pontiff did everything wrong
[1:56:05] <BliVru> @PatStaresAt Pat is called the Uriah Gambit, thats how Sullyvan got rid of all competition
[1:56:05] <Slimeking_Mike> Pontiff fucked the world up so bad.
[1:56:19] <AoiRob> just dont get hit
[1:56:29] <cheapdoc> I love that her steps are so bassy
[1:56:31] <%Monkeyweed21> Ludleth is the only reason Pontiff didnt ruin literally everything
[1:56:34] <+fetrigon> OMEGALUL
[1:56:37] <thebehatted> elden ring's steam page has been up for less than a day and it managed to reach the #2 spot in upcoming dating sims

[1:56:51] <dekkitout> @thebehatted Nice
[1:56:52] <Madinki> AND THEY SPELL DISSASTER FOR YOU! AT SACRIFICE!
[1:56:53] <Zayasu> Jebaited
[1:56:53] <Too_Much_Nukie> This fight is a lot easier if you use a crossbow in the offhand to shoot Dancer when she stands still.
[1:56:54] <+rafaelba93> yep
[1:56:55] <Wydamn> good effort Patsworth
[1:56:57] <thebehatted> steam page is up, yessir

[2:02:39] <AoiRob> sell them to Handmaid?
[2:02:49] <%Issun135> pat that soul was damage reduction
[2:02:54] <%ironohki> But now you know
[2:02:56] <BliVru> Use Sacrifice In the Bonfire
[2:02:59] <Ethel9727> I think it means damage absorbtion
[2:03:01] <Too_Much_Nukie> Selling souls to handmaid gives the normal amount of souls for soul items.
[2:03:02] <BliVru> Is faster
[2:03:04] <mr_saturday93> LUL
[2:03:05] <+Shady_Zaku> RIP

[2:03:23] <TheHeroAppears> why would you use and item that rewards you for getting hit LUL
[2:03:24] <Too_Much_Nukie> Pat forgot that absorption in Dark Souls is damage reduction.
[2:03:25] <DrkJP520> i read something once
[2:03:26] <dekkitout> Why does your guy look like he's near brimming with evil sex energy
[2:03:29] <GuyverTypeL> Getting old sucks man
[2:03:30] <Bu5hranger> Damn, I wish I could read
[2:03:31] <AoiRob> @PatStaresAt just sell to handmaid it's faster
[2:03:31] <Zooperton> I never learned to read
[2:03:37] <%BoxNavy> please dont read
[2:03:38] <%big_boss_baby> The jewel
[2:03:39] <cheapdoc> I read Mistborn recently, it was aight, but could've been better
[2:03:40] <%TheReallJimbo> bye y'all. I need to go to bed. good luck, Pat. stream good
[2:03:41] <+TheBitingIrish> Pat, when was the last time you handwrote something?
[2:03:56] <%BoxNavy> good
[2:03:57] <%ironohki> @dekkitout Would you prefer it was evil not-sex energy? No? Didn't think so.
[2:04:10] <%DakotaMacDoodle> Yeah but reading  in the Dark Souls world is legit dangerous
[2:04:14] <%MechArch> what is that? a color?
[2:04:19] <Laecerelius> Oooooh
[2:04:24] <Profmcstevie> Minimal help~

[2:04:54] <dekkitout> "Even better, Paige found four different secret bosses in 2 hours"
[2:04:58] <+fetrigon> well technically that's not fair cuz paige still needs her meds
[2:05:00] <%baronblank> that's what makes it fair though

[2:06:01] <+aBoner89> :) ?
[2:06:03] <%AzureGale> snuffOmegalul
[2:06:10] <Tracazoid> Pat's main advantage is Paige might get lost long enough to not kill the boss super fast
[2:06:10] <%RAGING_1NF3RNO> On Paige's stream: "You know Pat did get lost here at all."
[2:06:14] <%RealThiele> attention go big up

[2:06:30] <%RealThiele> aaaaaaand now
[2:06:31] <silkoh> Did Paige enjoy her birthday?
[2:06:32] <MrDrayko> Doubt
[2:06:40] <DrkJP520> Speaking of Boi, have you considered streaming some old God of War games?
[2:06:46] <%patriotrenegade> Remake orOG
[2:06:47] <MrDrayko> Full smash fast vs full slow waiting
[2:06:49] <AoiRob> just giv her big weapon
[2:06:49] <%big_boss_baby> psaMenace psaMenace Crazy Talk psaMenace psaMenace
[2:06:52] <GuyverTypeL> but back then OOOHO
[2:06:54] <TheAntiNihilist> I think its the hardest imo
[2:06:57] <ExpressNode> I still got my PS3 version but it's jank
[2:06:57] <%RealThiele> 4-1 spin boiz
[2:06:58] <cheapdoc> But Paige can only go fast
[2:06:59] <%KeiganOfAstora> @PatStaresAt Is she gonna stream DS3 DLC this weekend?
[2:06:59] <Jetsfantasy> I still can't get a PS5 FeelsBadMan
[2:06:59] <BliVru> Try the Curse of Valor bigger chance of primordial
[2:07:02] <+aBoner89> is Demon Souls worth getting the console or no?
[2:07:04] <Ekaelis> It's disappointing really, its the same game but with new coat of paint.
[2:07:07] <fugly_nick> Remake's even easier thanks to omnidirectional rolling
[2:07:07] <%bread_assassin> Only difficult part for me was rushing Flamelurker and Astrea for earliest possible Blueblood Sword
[2:07:13] <%big_boss_baby> What if it wasn't
[2:07:14] <%Jack_of_No_Trades> I think it was less difficult and more inscrutable, now we know how things work
[2:07:14] <$Ziegsy> its the hardest one to platinum
[2:07:30] <AoG_JarlRaven> @Jetsfantasy do you really need a PS5 at this point though?
[2:07:31] <Profmcstevie> It's the hardest one to understand, it's a fucking labyrinth to deal with weapons
[2:07:36] <shotgang86> >World tendency
[2:07:37] <%big_boss_baby> It doesn't help that 80% of the bosses are gimmicks
[2:07:38] <%baronblank> some of its areas are still a pain in the ass if you don't do them in the right order, but the bosses are jokes mostly
[2:07:38] <MrDrayko> The pace change from Bloodborne/Ds3 to DeS is what killed me the hardest
[2:07:39] <GuyverTypeL> Difficulty is just chemicals in the brain man
[2:07:40] <Maids4lyfe> yeah
[2:07:42] <+doomunderthestairs> it'd be cool to play the remake if ps5s were actually available
[2:07:43] <Eightesu> wot about sekiro Kappa
[2:07:43] <cheapdoc> but Gas Gas Gas, she gotta step on the Gas
[2:07:48] <%moonmintparadise> yeah the first one you play is always the hardest one. People like Dark Souls 2 because it was their first one
[2:07:52] <+TraitorousAlf> man, I find bloodborne to be the hardest, but it certainly wasn't my first :(
[2:07:57] <%Buzzard42> Buzzard42 subscribed at Tier 1. They've subscribed for 17 months! 
[2:07:57] <Jetsfantasy> @AoG_JarlRaven Until DeS remake is ported to PC, yeah, you need a PS5 to play it
[2:08:02] <fugly_nick> Also, World Tendency is awful
[2:08:03] <MarvelousMrD> its still shocking to me we havent seen a bloodborne 2 just for the sake of revanue at this point
[2:08:05] <+aBoner89> Kappa
[2:08:05] <%DakotaMacDoodle> BloodBorne is the hardest of the games to me
[2:08:08] <ExpressNode> Those don't exist what are you talking about
[2:08:08] <penitentpendant> Honestly, the QoL for the crystal lizards makes the modern version outright easier than the old version
[2:08:09] <dekkitout> PS5? What's that, a cryptid?
[2:08:11] <%SWFanatic> bork buster
[2:08:12] <%MechArch> psaLiz
[2:08:15] <+The_Yottabyte> @moonmintparadise I disagree, I liked DS2 because stable framerate and better PVP
[2:08:15] <%RealThiele> get enchanted falchion +1, gg
[2:08:15] <Ethel9727> DeS is just playing an easier Dark Souls but you put it in a foreign language
[2:08:16] <%captain_kirkhammer> I'm so proud I was able to get a Pure Pladestone, dupe it, and give them away to tons of people
[2:08:18] <Maids4lyfe> dog time!
[2:08:23] <sirrice77> yeah all my friends think the series got easier over time and just don't account for the fact that their first would be the hardest
[2:08:26] <+The_Yottabyte> after beating DS1 once I stopped buyt put like 400+ hrs into 2
[2:08:28] <%patriotrenegade> Im gonna mug my local scalper for a PS5
[2:08:30] <cheapdoc> The PS5 is the Col du mamadacua
[2:08:35] <%KeiganOfAstora> Did you guys know about Wikidot back in the day? It was super precise for DeS and DS1
[2:08:41] <+doomunderthestairs> that ratchet and clank game too
[2:08:45] <TheAntiNihilist> I played it for the first time this year and i still think its the hardest. Tons of boss jank or mandatory strategies
[2:08:46] <fnjohnboy> DS2 is kinda hard
[2:08:51] <$Ziegsy> theres 1 ps5 in circulation, we all take turns
[2:08:58] <valriot> 2 is hard cos it plays bad
[2:08:59] <shotgang86> 2 is harder for the wrong reasons
[2:09:00] <%Tman451> 2 is difficult due to jenk
[2:09:00] <+Monograxo> 2 is the hardest, lotsa bullshit
[2:09:01] <ExpressNode> Yeah DS2 was in some different shit
[2:09:01] <%big_boss_baby> The DLC in 2 is hard, the base game is meh
[2:09:02] <+The_Yottabyte> yea it makes ppl learn to play without lock on like men
[2:09:03] <DrkJP520> The pure Bladestone was the platinum trophy stopper. I got super lucky and got mine super early
[2:09:07] <TerrifyingRei_05> easier or less jank?
[2:09:08] <fugly_nick> Especially Old Hunters
[2:09:09] <%AnIcedCoffee> I don't think 2 is hardest, it's just the most annoying
[2:09:09] <rekinom> We got a shipment of 3 PS5s pretty recently at my local walmart. An asshole I know who works there bought them all and had them up on craigslist
[2:09:10] <Node_One> actual artificial difficulty with SOTFS
[2:09:12] <thekingjanglesbible> Golddick Lewis got a PS5 in that coffin
[2:09:12] <+TalBZ> Is that just because DS2 has worse encounter designs
[2:09:13] <+coffeebearCafe> 2 is trash
[2:09:14] <%RealThiele> DS2 kills you in fall damage
[2:09:16] <Ekaelis> Hmm, DS2 is hard due to Adaptibility shenanigans
[2:09:17] <TheAntiNihilist> Hell no
[2:09:18] <+doomunderthestairs> just start with bloodborne like I did and you'll be set
[2:09:20] <Eightesu> sekiro tho
[2:09:22] <AoG_JarlRaven> @Jetsfantasy didn't see you were looking specifically to play the remake can't get around that there's always the ps3 version at least
[2:09:25] <GuyverTypeL> DS3 looks hard tho when looking at another person play it
[2:09:27] <cooldude69xx> Ivory King comes to mind
[2:09:29] <%whyskeywolfe> Sekiro tho
[2:09:29] <Jontman42> no give me harder
[2:09:30] <%baronblank> orphan is pretty insane yea
[2:09:33] <peyodogo> it really depends i think, there's a good amount of people that gel really really well with the fast paced fuck your face vibe
[2:09:34] <dekkitout> Orphan is a near on crime against humanity
[2:09:34] <%captain_kirkhammer> Ludwig is harder imo
[2:09:34] <+The_Yottabyte> ppl are still butthurt that they can't baby their way through 2 with lock-on 1 on 1s all day against giant bosses who you just ass-hug all day
[2:09:39] <valriot> I beat Orphan in like 4 tries, and i dunno what i did wrong
[2:09:42] <%ironohki> Orphan > Midir?
[2:09:43] <AoG_JarlRaven> I remember seeing Orphan of Kos for the first time and thinking this was going to be an easy fight
[2:09:46] <Too_Much_Nukie> Bloodborne rewards facefucking everything. It's not as hard as people say it's just not Dark Souls.
[2:09:46] <%RAGING_1NF3RNO> Really? I beat Orphan in 3 tries.
[2:09:47] <%big_boss_baby> ymfah beat Orphan at SL1, we can go farther
[2:09:48] <%Dakuu75> I played Bloodborne before DS3 and I feel DS3 is harder for me.
[2:09:52] <%KeiganOfAstora> DS2 was the least fair
[2:09:56] <Profmcstevie> Unlimited aggro versus limited defence
[2:09:57] <+TalBZ> Orphan had so much health too, so its a battle of attrition
[2:09:58] <raveous> orphan pretty weak to parry tech tho
[2:10:02] <robosqueeb> man i feel bad for the pilgrims they really show how never dying would suck balls
[2:10:03] <%ironohki> @big_boss_baby Why even is Ymfah?
[2:10:03] <+doomunderthestairs> ludwig is pretty damn insane too but orphan is a thought time all around
[2:10:05] <fugly_nick> They knew how hard Orphan was when they put the lantern right before the fog wall
[2:10:05] <%Romuken> spoopy lady
[2:10:05] <+coffeebearCafe> midir is the worst
[2:10:06] <Robot_Ridley> Lawrence was the hardest for me in bb
[2:10:07] <@Pandora_Prime> Orphan is a character action boss
[2:10:07] <%DakotaMacDoodle> BB is brutal because you get nowhere going on the defensive
[2:10:08] <Srthunda> once you learn how to use a camera properly its easier
[2:10:09] <DrkJP520> Sekiro buttfucked me hard tho
[2:10:14] <cheapdoc> No BONEfire
[2:10:16] <%BoxNavy> ds3 is insanely difficult for me
[2:10:19] <TheAntiNihilist> Midir  >>>>>>> Orphan
[2:10:23] <%BoxNavy> i cannot beat it
[2:10:24] <AoG_JarlRaven> once I learned to keep a certain amount of distance from Orphan at all times he did get much easier
[2:10:26] <dekkitout> To call Ymfah an outlier is a drastic statement
[2:10:28] <Maids4lyfe> sword saint isshin
[2:10:33] <dekkitout> *understatement
[2:10:34] <%captain_kirkhammer> Midir and the DS2 secret corridor DLC bosses don't count, they're raid bosses
[2:10:36] <TheHeroAppears> why does the melee sound have a delay
[2:10:37] <%patriotrenegade> Paarl is the worst to fight because of the camera. Absolute hell when you fight him in a cursed Chalice Dungeon.
[2:10:38] <%ironohki> @TheAntiNihilist I have legit heard people discuss this like gif vs gif.
[2:10:39] <+Birdigalore> Blind
[2:10:41] <%vandastelka> Koz easy just parry
[2:10:42] <Too_Much_Nukie> GG Pat
[2:10:42] <shotgang86> LUL
[2:10:45] <+TheBitingIrish> Pat, binocs
[2:10:45] <%BoxNavy> :)
[2:10:46] <%za7az> LUL
[2:10:50] <Too_Much_Nukie> @PatStaresAt Just buy a god damn bow/crossbow.
[2:10:52] <Bu5hranger> Hahaha
[2:10:54] <%RealThiele> KOBE
[2:10:58] <ExpressNode> If you want some baby souls play code Vein
[2:11:02] <fugly_nick> He's got a crossbow
[2:11:02] <%KeiganOfAstora> @PatStaresAt How much of this have you played through already and will you please point out when you get to the point that you are totally blind on?
[2:11:02] <Maids4lyfe> FIRST TRY
[2:11:02] <DotDusk> First try PogChamp
[2:11:05] <BliVru> You have the crossbow
[2:11:07] <%Broand> You HAVE a crossbow
[2:11:16] <cheapdoc> Did you know this game was inspired by Berserk? it's true, like most things
[2:11:19] <Too_Much_Nukie> He can't use that crossbow.
[2:11:27] <%Paperware> Still can't beat Father Owl consistently, he has moves that literally fake you out
[2:11:28] <+The_Yottabyte> more like crossbooooring
[2:11:30] <Too_Much_Nukie> It's for faith builds.
[2:11:35] <%ironohki> @cheapdoc Everything was inspired by Berserk.
[2:11:37] <Ethel9727> Nah, it's the Lothric bi sword, it swings both ways
[2:11:41] <EldritchNeko> hey pat what was your starting class
[2:11:43] <%SWFanatic> whirlygig saw
[2:11:45] <+fetrigon> CHONK
[2:11:47] <dekkitout> Big bonk
[2:11:49] <cheapdoc> @cheapdoc Exactly
[2:11:49] <%KeiganOfAstora> Looks great, long reach
[2:11:57] <Profmcstevie> Unga bo Bunga
[2:12:04] <EldritchNeko> sick
[2:12:09] <fugly_nick> You can still aim and shoot bodies down with it
[2:12:17] <%vandastelka> I don't  know what you all talking about orphan is easy if you know how to parry
[2:12:24] <%Zundelle> @Paperware ye to me Father Owl was the hardest fight in soulbornikero series
[2:12:28] <Krash_Override> @PatStaresAt there were a lot of NXT releases just tweeted
[2:12:31] <DianaTheAscian> @PatStaresAt have you ever tried a bow/crossbow play through in any of the souls games?
[2:12:32] <cheapdoc> But can you use your PP two handed?
[2:12:33] <Too_Much_Nukie> It's not strength it's faith.
[2:12:35] <%za7az> @vandastelka Facts
[2:12:38] <Too_Much_Nukie> You have the knight's crossbow.
[2:12:40] <mrcelab> @PatStaresAt why are You not playing the Black 4 Blood open beta?
[2:12:41] <+The_Yottabyte> _____ is easy if you git gud
[2:12:44] <%ironohki> Know what makes me sad? In DS1, a shit stained large club can do better damage than the Dragon's Tooth by the time you're strong enough to wield Dragon's Tooth.
[2:12:52] <thekingjanglesbible> tree stuff
[2:12:53] <%ironohki> I REALLY WANT TO KNOW WHAT'S UP WITH THAT GUY
[2:12:59] <Ethel9727> He's just got some wood, don't stare at him
[2:13:02] <%Pappajimbo> he chilling
[2:13:02] <DianaTheAscian> tree shit
[2:13:04] <%Deft_Thought> Greatwood
[2:13:07] <+twohitgood> there is actually some talk about that. it's from an older iteration of DS3's story.
[2:13:07] <TheAntiNihilist> Tree boss
[2:13:08] <GuyverTypeL> just don't think about it
[2:13:08] <%RealThiele> tree curse
[2:13:09] <%SWFanatic> branches on the inside
[2:13:09] <BliVru> There's a new weapon in one of the hanging corpses
[2:13:10] <%ironohki> You tried, buddy.
[2:13:10] <%patriotrenegade> @PatStaresAt OH I KNOW THIS
[2:13:11] <%Agami23> i assumed its something to do with the greatwood
[2:13:12] <Ekaelis> You know who else turned to trees? Giants
[2:13:14] <dekkitout> I mean, the demons are tree people, right?
[2:13:14] <penitentpendant> It's 'Rot' inherented from the painting, I thought
[2:13:15] <robosqueeb> these dudes b returnin to da erff
[2:13:15] <lilnoun> sometimes its just a woodguy
[2:13:17] <%captain_kirkhammer> It's called motif
[2:13:17] <%RealThiele> TREEBALLS
[2:13:17] <%whyskeywolfe> NONE of the environmental storytelling is referenced. The SUN is BLEEDING and it's not explained or talked about.
[2:13:20] <DrkJP520> I don't think that one is
[2:13:21] <+Fooguwu> it's because miyazki watched Angel's Egg
[2:13:21] <%Romuken> get juked
[2:13:27] <thebehatted> no it's not
[2:13:27] <%patriotrenegade> HOLD UP
[2:13:29] <AoiRob> no its not
[2:13:29] <thekingjanglesbible> I always thought it must have had something to do with the world wanting and failing to revert to archtrees
[2:13:30] <Marakami_Sadaneo> Those Pilgrim Butterflies actually have noises when you get close to them.
[2:13:30] <Jontman42> I mean there's people wanting to become dragons so there's people wanting to become trees
[2:13:32] <Jolly_Adventurer> Its not
[2:13:40] <penitentpendant> Since that's where the Pontiff supposedly came from
[2:13:44] <Too_Much_Nukie> There is no reason for the tree people they just looked cool.
[2:13:45] <Profmcstevie> Angels Egg is a grand movie
[2:13:45] <Ethel9727> That one is not in fact a guy. Crazy talk man
[2:13:47] <fugly_nick> I hate these guys
[2:13:49] <Laecerelius> Miyazaki would like to offer you an egg in these trying times
[2:13:51] <Krash_Override> Bobby Fish was just released
[2:14:00] <%ironohki> Hasn't it happened a bunch of times by now?
[2:14:00] <EM2_art> 🥚 redsWTF
[2:14:01] <BliVru> I mean How much is lore an how much is "that'd be cool if we put it in"
[2:14:02] <%Treasure_Vault> Hey Pat, how many Vagrants have you seen in all your DS1 runs?
[2:14:03] <Ethel9727> Maybe the sun bleeding is a normal thing now
[2:14:05] <%big_boss_baby> Maybe they thought it was always that way
[2:14:07] <cheapdoc> Like there's a lot of people to talk with by the end of the game?
[2:14:10] <Jontman42> the world's hollow, no big deal
[2:14:10] <%baronouroboros> the whole world's undead at this point
[2:14:10] <CrimsonFox777> Just another Wednesday in this world.
[2:14:10] <%ironohki> That just means it's time to link.
[2:14:11] <Marakami_Sadaneo> but Pat, you mentioned it in the LP
[2:14:12] <+galaktic> what? seriously? can you show us?
[2:14:12] <robosqueeb> does that mean the sun can never die
[2:14:13] <KosOrSomeSayKosm_> you can read more about it in berserk
[2:14:16] <%Ynkubus_> nah, its fine
[2:14:16] <%Frost_Quill> @PatStaresAt When was the last time you looked DIRECTLY at the sun though?
[2:14:16] <%Treasure_Vault> Same.
[2:14:17] <dekkitout> The sun becoming a dark sign sounds pretty obvious
[2:14:18] <%sashagreenspiderqueen> im pretty sure vaati mentions both of those things
[2:14:21] <%RealThiele> *shrug* whatcha gonna do
[2:14:22] <Srthunda> that egg still makes me mad
[2:14:25] <%patriotrenegade> Ive seen two ever
[2:14:28] <%big_boss_baby> I'm not convinced Vagrants are real
[2:14:30] <+Monograxo> vagrants are super rare, I saw like 2 in 400hrs
[2:14:31] <Daxalog> Staring at the sun is baddddd
[2:14:33] <fugly_nick> I've beaten the game 4-5 times and never saw a single one
[2:14:34] <$realm_forge> The dark sign told me to cancel my Kickstarter
[2:14:34] <$Ziegsy> whats a vagrant?
[2:14:34] <+The_Yottabyte> the real sun was the friends we made along the way
[2:14:38] <Wydamn> it's like the world itself has become hollow
[2:14:39] <blue8moon> I think Woolie or Paige saw it on theirs
[2:14:43] <%Frost_Quill> I've NEVER seen a vagrant.
[2:14:43] <TheHeroAppears> yeah there was one in the lp
[2:14:45] <%Tman451> I had one attack me when I was checking my phone
[2:14:45] <cheapdoc> Sometimes it's just Sun melt tuesday
[2:14:45] <MrDrayko> Pretty much all the Metaphysics of the series are entirely untouched by anyone BUT Solaire in DaS and Aldia in DaS2
[2:14:51] <+Despera__> I have 1000 hours in DS1 with 1
[2:14:55] <%ironohki> I saw a bunch of vagrants getting 100% achievements in DS1. But I think it's because I drop all my dupe drops.
[2:14:57] <sirrice77> vagrants are crab bois with lasers
[2:14:57] <rekinom> I've played hundreds of hours of DS1, I've seen 2 vagants
[2:14:58] <+Panquake25> I've seen one ever
[2:14:59] <%DakotaMacDoodle> Well that game's story really got shuffle, cut, and changed a bunch
[2:15:03] <MrDrayko> Only humanity!
[2:15:03] <+twohitgood> can also seed it with dropping loot
[2:15:13] <+twohitgood> i've seen 3 in DSR on switch.
[2:15:17] <Profmcstevie> It manifests as a....crab thing
[2:15:19] <BliVru> Hnaging corpse has new weapon
[2:15:21] <%baronblank> I have seen exactly one vagrant in like 5 playthroughs of ds1
[2:15:23] <$Ziegsy> ooooo very cool
[2:15:23] <DianaTheAscian> I've never heard of this actually
[2:15:24] <fugly_nick> They're also really tough, right?
[2:15:24] <TheHeroAppears> I've seen 1
[2:15:25] <%Gogogolem> Its letarlly 1 in a million.
[2:15:27] <GuyverTypeL> are they tough tho?
[2:15:27] <%patriotrenegade> @PatStaresAt Zullie the Witch on YouTube has a video on the tree guys I can DM it to you on Twitter
[2:15:28] <%Frost_Quill> I've never seen one in my game.  EVER.
[2:15:29] <%bread_assassin> Didn't know that was a thing.
[2:15:29] <thebehatted> feels like they're more common in remastered
[2:15:32] <rekinom> They're rare because the netcode is so fucked in that game
[2:15:32] <%Zero_Jacks> people who die with huge Soul sacks, got it
[2:15:33] <+twohitgood> it's like a snowglobe with crab claws.
[2:15:35] <borkmire> chest on top of shelf you missed
[2:15:36] <+megaman_sentinel> i only seen 1
[2:15:37] <%AnIcedCoffee> I saw a few vagrants around DS Remastered's release but I only ever saw 1 during my og DS1 runs
[2:15:37] <MrDrayko> Theres a great video of Dark souls Dissected on them
[2:15:37] <DrkJP520> I've seen maybe 5 tops. Never found that chalice dungeon worm in Bloodborne though.
[2:15:37] <fnjohnboy> That's what those things are....
[2:15:39] <%Ynkubus_> HUMANTIY BECOME CRAB
[2:15:42] <%ironohki> @thebehatted I bet you're right.
[2:15:42] <LtBoiii> souls are like time for crab
[2:15:43] <BliVru> Only seen them in the Prepare to Die Again mod for DS
[2:15:43] <+AFellowDegen> seems like its less rare if your bad
[2:15:45] <%Treasure_Vault> You have to NOT pick up special items to spawn them in other player worlds
[2:15:45] <robosqueeb> what purpose do they serve?
[2:15:46] <Jontman42> never seen a single one
[2:15:46] <ChatNinja> I've fought 2 and only killed one
[2:15:48] <Wydamn> I played probably 200 hours on Dark Souls on xbox 360, and saw one once.
[2:15:50] <%LaughingCatt> same, only seen a Vagrant once despite a decade of playing DS1
[2:15:51] <+The_Yottabyte> it's LEGENDARY
[2:15:52] <GuyverTypeL> RETURN TO CRAB
[2:15:55] <+parazoa42> I saw 2 on my last play through.
[2:15:56] <+AugustHaze> I got 3 in the remastered lmao
[2:15:56] <Jetsfantasy> Good vagrants can't have the pickup be looted for 10 online travels before it becomes eggy boi
[2:16:02] <K1llingEdge> In the near 2kk hrs i have accumulatively played ds1 i have seen like 5 to 10
[2:16:04] <EldritchNeko> i saw one my first playthrough and it baffled me for the longest time
[2:16:06] <TheAntiNihilist> I saw one and it scared me so much i ran away and thought i was crazy for seeing it
[2:16:09] <DianaTheAscian> oh i'e never seen one of those thats for sure
[2:16:10] <%captain_kirkhammer> I saw one and it killed me because I pancked
[2:16:13] <+kewlmyc> Did she always talk?
[2:16:14] <DianaTheAscian> i've*
[2:16:15] <+Doorjamb13> Only saw one once and it was on the invisible crystals
[2:16:20] <%Insom62> i have 500 hours ive seen 3
[2:16:25] <+megaman_sentinel> i was in blight town swamp
[2:16:28] <GeoGio3> Can you play DS1 in your head like RE2??
[2:16:30] <penitentpendant> @kewlmyc It's a warning for her hug attack
[2:16:33] <DianaTheAscian> are they strong?
[2:16:34] <Slimeking_Mike> o h h c l e a n s e t h e b a s t a r d s c u r s e
[2:16:38] <BliVru> Vagrants are the people who thought that Final Fantasy 7 Re was neve coming out
[2:16:40] <+vaderxyz1970> I have never heard nor seen this enemy wtf
[2:16:42] <penitentpendant> @kewlmyc Well, AN attack.
[2:16:42] <+The_Yottabyte> greeeedy
[2:16:44] <thebehatted> there's a whole video talking about how miracle resonance is straight up broken in ds1
[2:16:46] <%RealThiele> Gas souls
[2:16:50] <%Agami23> dude same
[2:16:54] <%baronblank> I legit forgot miracle resonance existed
[2:17:02] <Jetsfantasy> Miracle resonance is wack
[2:17:03] <%Ynkubus_> I think I ran into more vagrants (3) than gravelords in DS1
[2:17:04] <Wydamn> I really liked the idea of Miracle Resonance once I figured out it wasn't a UI error
[2:17:11] <Too_Much_Nukie> There are a lot of mechanics in DS1 built for online play that just never ever worked.
[2:17:13] <Esperflame> I've seen 3 Vagrants in 2 different spots.
[2:17:15] <penitentpendant> I enjoy FromSoftware games, but BOY is it always last minute when it goes out the door
[2:17:18] <Zakaraz> apparently they spawn under certain conditions. something to do with other players dropping large amounts of humanity or certain items will spawn them in other worlds.
[2:17:19] <%patriotrenegade> But they never FINISH their games
[2:17:19] <BliVru> They are also shockingly Incompetent too somehow
[2:17:19] <Eightesu> D:
[2:17:25] <LtBoiii> i thought gravelord shit in 1 was some hacker shenanigans
[2:17:28] <+The_Yottabyte> speaking of an actual person vision, did you see the new Suicide Squad @PatStaresAt ?
[2:17:30] <BliVru> wAIT THE bODIES!
[2:17:34] <+CookieCutter007> Sooooo much cut content
[2:17:35] <DianaTheAscian> and somehow it comes together in the end
[2:17:36] <BliVru> iN THE TREE
[2:17:37] <Profmcstevie> They are doing PRETTY DAMN GOOD considering what they were making before souls games
[2:17:43] <+twohitgood> watch them still wind up having to fully rework the story just like DS2 and 3.
[2:17:43] <penitentpendant> Go the 'Sekiro' route of 'built in DLC' feeling
[2:17:44] <%captain_kirkhammer> you know it won't be
[2:17:44] <Too_Much_Nukie> Yeah every single time they make a game Fromsoft rushes it and botches multiple mechanics.
[2:17:44] <+V3RTIGO_222> Question for From Soft: Next Armored Core when guiys?
[2:17:50] <%SWFanatic> demon souls remaster looks like it ran pretty well
[2:17:50] <karl_rex> soup
[2:17:52] <Eightesu> You have to remember they were a small studio that blew up
[2:17:55] <MrDrayko> I'm sure there will still be a MOUNTAIN of cut content people can rip up
[2:17:56] <Ekaelis> I just hope it's not Dark Souls 4 in everything but name
[2:18:02] <BliVru> Outside
[2:18:02] <thebehatted> oh shit the server
[2:18:06] <shotgang86> I thought Elden Ring was coming out at an appropriate time then I remembered when Dark Souls 3 came out.
[2:18:08] <+thefancywig> yeah just the sheer volume of cut content bums me out in some of their stuff
[2:18:14] <Too_Much_Nukie> @Eightesu Who isn't? Everyone starts small.
[2:18:15] <BliVru> yep
[2:18:16] <penitentpendant> Wow, they added more loot to that tree
[2:18:17] <DianaTheAscian> oh thats new
[2:18:21] <Wydamn> I remember how the original with DSFix would make you drop through ground while sliding on ladders if you changed the framerate.
[2:18:23] <LtBoiii> piñata time
[2:18:26] <$Ziegsy> fromsoft, eternal ring remake, when?
[2:18:27] <Gelphaze> look at all that!'
[2:18:41] <$dalmek> I like the little "loaded bolt" indicator
[2:18:52] <EldritchNeko> im excited elden ring will be co-op thats really good
[2:18:53] <cheapdoc> Ewww, don't show us your sack
[2:18:55] <CrimsonFox777> WHEEL BOI TIME
[2:18:56] <%FacetiousAF> nice
[2:18:59] <+Monograxo> that one ladder leaving the rat sewer leading to the giant pig would make you fall through the ground always
[2:18:59] <Too_Much_Nukie> You gotta shoot the bodies on the Berserk tree.
[2:19:01] <DianaTheAscian> bloodborne weapon
[2:19:07] <Too_Much_Nukie> Bulwark ring is god-tier in this.
[2:19:07] <KosOrSomeSayKosm_> there's a fourth thing as well
[2:19:11] <Wydamn> There's Gut's Mom
[2:19:15] <BliVru> Bloodborne
[2:19:16] <Too_Much_Nukie> Bulwark ring just stops all weapon degradation.
[2:19:17] <%patriotrenegade> Thats an actual cut weapon from DS3
[2:19:17] <GuyverTypeL> YEYEYEYE
[2:19:18] <$dalmek> that's fucking Logarius' Wheel
[2:19:24] <%patriotrenegade> Logarius Wheel
[2:19:25] <%bevyrage> 2 hand the wheel and use its weapon art
[2:19:26] <$Ziegsy> its an okay shield
[2:19:31] <%flying_hipp0> Michellen Man incoming
[2:19:32] <BliVru> Missed one I swear is the best oe
[2:19:36] <Srthunda> pls tell me it transforms when double handed
[2:19:39] <BliVru> Missed one
[2:19:41] <blue8moon> there's another I think
[2:19:41] <%sileo_patronus> Does the wheel ability work?
[2:19:43] <Yrefe> equip the S A C K
[2:19:49] <AoiRob> missed one
[2:19:53] <Yrefe> fashion sack
[2:19:56] <fugly_nick> That would be pretty good on the washing pole
[2:19:57] <BliVru> Sorry for being anoying
[2:20:16] <Too_Much_Nukie> Bulwark ring is a godsend for any crystal weapon.
[2:20:17] <BliVru> Wait they took it out
[2:20:27] <%SWFanatic> show don't tell
[2:20:30] <pi_in_the_sci> There was another one right next to the one you just shot down
[2:20:32] <+The_Yottabyte> the plot thinnens
[2:20:32] <+Darky04> edgy weapon
[2:20:34] <%sileo_patronus> Nah the plows in 3
[2:20:39] <homestylewaffles> there's so much to collect, you're encouraged to go everywhere so much
[2:20:46] <dekkitout> Battle fork
[2:20:49] <BliVru> You sure the irsn't one left?
[2:20:51] <Zooperton> different plow, this one's from 3
[2:20:52] <%patriotrenegade> Aw, you dont fall over
[2:20:54] <thebehatted> pssh
[2:20:54] <carrion_king_> DO THE ABILITY ON THE FOUR PRONGED PLUS HEAVY ATTACK
[2:20:55] <penitentpendant> Anyone else feel it's weird that Psychonauts 2 is coming out this month with little fanfare? Although, I suppose they had to eat their marketing budget to keep things running.
[2:20:56] <+zuzuxiv> four-pronged is in ds3 normally
[2:20:58] <%Frost_Quill> Sackboy Samurai.
[2:20:59] <Yrefe> nah thats the fork that the guys in this area use
[2:20:59] <homestylewaffles> love how they just give full armor sets at a time
[2:21:06] <%BoxNavy> why dont you look at this sack B)
[2:21:09] <shotgang86> psaSkelmoney
[2:21:09] <GuyverTypeL> "Now, chew throught my ballsack!"
[2:21:16] <+thelonechris> It's kinda weird yeah
[2:21:18] <Too_Much_Nukie> Wonderful
[2:21:20] <Profmcstevie> Psychonauts 2 has been a fever dream for years
[2:21:21] <islandsunn> the plow is a normal drop here in vanilla ds3
[2:21:23] <penitentpendant> Which is fair
[2:21:27] <Profmcstevie> we're kinda fizzled out
[2:21:35] <Mudstone12> what happened in broken age?
[2:21:41] <shotgang86> man psichonauts 2, never thought it would come out
[2:21:43] <$Jaxnos> double fine games exist in a weird bubble for me.
[2:21:48] <+The_Yottabyte> wont need the hype if it turns out to be great
[2:21:50] <cheapdoc> But also Psyconauts 2 was a youtuber meme for the longest ime
[2:21:54] <%flying_hipp0> easy mode: activate
[2:21:56] <TheAngryArtist> well psychonauts 1 is pretty bad honestly
[2:21:58] <ChatNinja> Chest
[2:22:00] <shotgang86> missed a chest
[2:22:01] <TheHeroAppears> yeah it did
[2:22:02] <%big_boss_baby> When's the last time they made a game that had actual gameplay
[2:22:02] <mr_saturday93> LUL good timing
[2:22:03] <%Broand> clp that
[2:22:04] <Profmcstevie> The problem was never the dying in 1
[2:22:05] <%flying_hipp0> it did not what the fuck pat
[2:22:06] <ChatNinja> Back in that barn
[2:22:07] <+thelonechris> Psychonauts had to end with a fucking escort mission
[2:22:09] <%BoxNavy> "oh my god i almost killed myself" - everyone after they played psychonauts
[2:22:13] <%Treasure_Vault> Psychonauts 1 only played mostly like shit, and the meat circus which was entirely shit
[2:22:16] <%ironohki> Psyconauts was really clunky. I've had a hard time getting people who never played it to play it.
[2:22:18] <Wydamn> @BoxNavy, LUL
[2:22:29] <stardustcrusad3r> I loved psychonauts 1 but in retrospects its so clunky and charming at the same time
[2:22:31] <shotgang86> too far
[2:22:32] <%SWFanatic> that dog was super impressed by your moves
[2:22:33] <mr_saturday93> Psychonauts was awesome
[2:22:33] <+kullumanati> I’m sic for psychonauts 2
[2:22:33] <%ironohki> @Treasure_Vault God that took determination to get through.
[2:22:34] <penitentpendant> A fair point
[2:22:37] <KosOrSomeSayKosm_> at the entrance
[2:22:37] <MarvelousMrD> they so clearly only wrote the firrst half of broken age and then just rushed out a half baked idea for the second
[2:22:38] <shotgang86> go back, right
[2:22:40] <+kullumanati> Yes it did
[2:22:43] <+mecha_11> Oh no I thought Psychonauts 1 played fine
[2:22:46] <GuyverTypeL> @ironohki is it worth a play? Never touched it
[2:22:47] <%big_boss_baby> It's a product of its time
[2:22:48] <Profmcstevie> I feel like the invincibility won't cover for anydesign choices that make the game hard to play
[2:22:50] <mr_saturday93> I remember it being fine
[2:22:51] <%whyskeywolfe> Tim Schaeffer really feels like the Kevin Smith of the videogame dev community insofar as his love for his old works that are now decades out of date.
[2:22:51] <TheAngryArtist> i tried to play it recently and it does not hold up at all.
[2:22:52] <%SWFanatic> yes a loincloth, finally
[2:22:54] <%Treasure_Vault> I wish the game part of psychonauts was better.
[2:22:56] <+The_Yottabyte> also now that Duke Nukem Forever isn't a meme and ppl are sick of Half Life 3 memes the "never comin out" games don't get the hype anymore
[2:22:56] <penitentpendant> I'm replaying Psychonauts 1 to remove the nostalgia filter
[2:22:58] <+thelonechris> The art style was kind of hideous to look at tbh
[2:22:59] <BliVru> The chests Don't have lighting so they look like the Enviroment
[2:22:59] <homestylewaffles> do you think there's any charm in mimicking that game's clunkiness as if it was a recent sequel? gives the people what they want, I guess?
[2:23:03] <%big_boss_baby> It suffers heavily from the Seinfeld Effect in a post-Persona world
[2:23:03] <cheapdoc> Wait, if psyconauts 1 plays like shit, why did people want a sequel?
[2:23:03] <%Deft_Thought> Psychonauts gives up the ghost in the 3rd act. All the quirkiness couldn't save it from how sharp the difficulty curve jumped up once you get to the Meat Circus
[2:23:08] <+punchdrunk_donkeybooy> Meat circus was awful
[2:23:11] <%flying_hipp0> man i really enojyed psychonauts. had a lot charm to it
[2:23:11] <+zuzuxiv> I greatly dislike psychonaut's aesthetic
[2:23:14] <%big_boss_baby> @cheapdoc nostalgia
[2:23:16] <%Treasure_Vault> Cause the story and art are awesome.
[2:23:17] <mr_saturday93> Pat's shitty hot take
[2:23:22] <TheAngryArtist> @cheapdoc nostalgia
[2:23:26] <shotgang86> psuchonauts 1 has some good things and ideas, the milkman level and the godzilla level are amazing
[2:23:27] <+mecha_11> "Played" and "felt" and "looked" are 3 different things
[2:23:27] <+thelonechris> Because it's a cult hit
[2:23:32] <TheHeroAppears> it's a great game
[2:23:33] <%Zero_Jacks> Rose tinted glasses prob
[2:23:34] <shotgang86> I hope 2 plays better
[2:23:37] <Profmcstevie> Why do people want a sequel to a game with great ideas that needed polish?
[2:23:37] <+It_sjustjoey> LUL
[2:23:39] <Mudstone12> pats on his shit
[2:23:39] <dekkitout> So a do over
[2:23:40] <%Cykron> @cheapdoc Cause Psychonauts 1 is an excellent game
[2:23:40] <fugly_nick> I never liked Undead Settlement, and I think it's why I never get very far past it on replays
[2:23:40] <stardustcrusad3r> story and levels were cool as shit
[2:23:42] <%Jack_of_No_Trades> Fun characters and world
[2:23:42] <cheapdoc> It's always nostalgia huh?
[2:23:43] <%RealThiele> nostalgia baybee
[2:23:46] <GrandmasterBFunk> It's official, Donkey Kong Country Tropical freeze is bad because it has an invincible mode
[2:23:46] <Wydamn> cheapdoc because wacky humor and cool visual effects and powers carried the game
[2:23:50] <+The_Yottabyte> yea a lot of people's "top ten" old games play like trash
[2:23:51] <DracaenaLeaf> Psychonauts is a little jank but I didn't mind the controls. The story/characters was amazing
[2:23:53] <BliVru> Psychonauts 2 or Beyond Good and Evil 2 which do you choose?
[2:23:53] <Profmcstevie> Tons of games could DO with a sequel to tighten it up
[2:23:56] <1dennis> deadly premonition 1 playedlike shit and 2 was also shit but people still wanted it
[2:23:58] <%DakotaMacDoodle> Idk the Psychonauts 2 gameplay they showed off looked all right it also going to be on gamepass day one so that will probably help
[2:24:01] <%flying_hipp0> i should replay psychonauts
[2:24:03] <+mecha_11> Nah man psychonauts was fun
[2:24:03] <%NateyBeak> im playing it right now and its not so bad, but yea the controls could be polished, i hope 2 feels better too ya but im excited atleast!
[2:24:03] <%big_boss_baby> @Profmcstevie Many people have already made games that do the same idea better in the years since
[2:24:04] <%whyskeywolfe> I hate the visual design of it so much.
[2:24:05] <penitentpendant> People have gotten a few demo runs of the second game last month
[2:24:05] <+twohitgood> the story and presentation is fun. the gameplay was good enough for me.
[2:24:06] <%ironohki> Huh.
[2:24:07] <TheAngryArtist> i dare any of you defending it to go play it right now
[2:24:11] <Explodincatz> its always nostalgia, kill nostalgia
[2:24:15] <mr_saturday93> I hate platformers?
[2:24:15] <shotgang86> final level of 1 is the level that shows how much that game has bad controls
[2:24:16] <Wydamn> Who asked for a Nier sequel?
[2:24:19] <Shirousuke1989> Instead of Psychonaughts try Persona 5 Strikers! It's basically the same thing!
[2:24:20] <%Deft_Thought> It's a charming game. It just doesn't feel good to play
[2:24:20] <%JoshManVGH> The action in Brutal Legends was alright. Maybe they learned something?
[2:24:20] <Eightesu> thoughts on Vampire the Masquerade 2 being indefinitely delayed?
[2:24:23] <%AzureGale> ok
[2:24:25] <%SWFanatic> it wasn't fun to play, but it was a fun game
[2:24:25] <%NateyBeak> thats Scott C's art for ya
[2:24:30] <Too_Much_Nukie> Pretty much. I like the world of Psychonauts a lot. A Psychonauts sequel with more polish would be a lot of fun.
[2:24:30] <mr_saturday93> you*
[2:24:30] <TheHeroAppears> @TheAngryArtist I replayed it a few weeks back
[2:24:30] <+The_Yottabyte> @TheAngryArtist ok installing now what do i get for doing it
[2:24:32] <%Deft_Thought> Kinda like No More Heroes
[2:24:36] <Profmcstevie> @big_boss_baby agreed, very Metroid in that regard the genre and tropes have been reiterated and improved in their absence
[2:24:40] <shotgang86> >Eccentric
[2:24:41] <Eightesu> ARCHIBALD
[2:24:42] <+AnActualHermitCrab> @TheAngryArtist I just went and played it and I loved it. :)
[2:24:46] <%Treasure_Vault> There are two or three really cool levels, but most of Psychonauts 1 isn't that interesting
[2:24:47] <+mecha_11> Psychonauts has actually aged really well wtf?
[2:24:47] <hakumaribo> @PatStaresAt dudei cant agree more, i was gifted that game a few years ago, played itfor like 20 minutes and was like... nah...
[2:24:50] <islandsunn> pat did you know binding of Isaac allows unlocks with mods now
[2:24:52] <%ironohki> You know that thing where "it get really good at 20 hours" or whatever? For Psychonauts, my entire memory is like three specific levels.
[2:24:55] <%Frost_Quill> "I think that enemy got, THE POINT." - Archibald
[2:24:55] <%BoxNavy> YOU DO??
[2:24:57] <Eightesu> Archibald no!
[2:24:58] <%AzureGale> Yes, we all do shit at this
[2:24:59] <%big_boss_baby> @Profmcstevie And then the ultimate example, Shenmue 3
[2:25:03] <dekkitout> Archibald? From Bloodborne?
[2:25:04] <%flying_hipp0> but pat also has weird quirks that are insane
[2:25:05] <$Jaxnos> is he holding the freaking tonitrus?
[2:25:07] <mr_saturday93> but you like tank controls...
[2:25:09] <Too_Much_Nukie> ARCHIBALD HYPE
[2:25:09] <shotgang86> got lightning bitch?
[2:25:12] <Profmcstevie> Control should be FIRST thing you nail in a game, yet it somehow isn't
[2:25:14] <TheAngryArtist> yall have high tolerance for shit then
[2:25:14] <fugly_nick> Man look at this guy go
[2:25:14] <%Deft_Thought> What the hell
[2:25:15] <islandsunn> oh boy time to get fucked
[2:25:17] <Too_Much_Nukie> He is.
[2:25:20] <Wydamn> lightning boi
[2:25:20] <%Frost_Quill> That's a bloodborne weapon yesssss
[2:25:22] <TheHeroAppears> climbing the asylum in psychonauts was basically the first "getting over it"
[2:25:25] <Too_Much_Nukie> He is using the Tonitrus and lightning spears.
[2:25:27] <+thelonechris> "HAH! I think that enemy got, the POINT!"
[2:25:31] <%big_boss_baby> @mr_saturday93 Tank controls make sense for fixed camera games only
[2:25:41] <%MrBorisMakarov> LUL
[2:25:41] <%big_boss_baby> or I guess if you're literally playing a tank
[2:25:41] <dekkitout> "Fall off the cliff, loser!"
[2:25:44] <KosOrSomeSayKosm_> that fucker be perfect blockin
[2:25:45] <%Frost_Quill> TONITRUS
[2:25:48] <Profmcstevie> Get huarded
[2:25:50] <Gelphaze> Good shit!
[2:25:51] <tanarath> PJSalt PJSalt PJSalt
[2:25:51] <+chaumiester> No you
[2:25:51] <%SWFanatic> nice
[2:25:51] <+fetrigon> das bullshit LUL
[2:25:53] <shotgang86> you got the tonitrus yay
[2:25:54] <+The_Yottabyte> symscW symscW
[2:25:56] <%bevyrage> @big_boss_baby and also tank games
[2:25:56] <BliVru> I think that Bloodborne weapons get the Dash too
[2:26:00] <Eightesu> that was a cool move
[2:26:03] <mr_saturday93> Tank controls suck though even with fixed cams
[2:26:03] <%ironohki> @dekkitout I will never forget Lucky Ted.
[2:26:05] <Too_Much_Nukie> Of course they can Pat.
[2:26:09] <Too_Much_Nukie> Git Gud.
[2:26:11] <Wydamn> You got the Tonitrus,. you can't hear so good now
[2:26:14] <fugly_nick> I've been pronouncing Tonitrus wrong all this time
[2:26:22] <Eightesu> how tho
[2:26:28] <%SWFanatic> patron want upsies
[2:26:31] <Eightesu> there's bodies in there
[2:26:39] <+TheBitingIrish> Pat wtf, stop getting excited by new armor just to keep on the chainmail
[2:26:58] <%big_boss_baby> @bevyrage Honestly they didn't even give the tank in RE8 tank controls
[2:27:02] <KosOrSomeSayKosm_> by the way, do the cloth parts of bloodborne/other imported stuff have physics now?
[2:27:10] <$Jaxnos> so are the FP moves substituting in for the bloodborne switching?
[2:27:13] <DrkJP520> Bloodborne feels like FROM's most polished game.
[2:27:16] <%whyskeywolfe> Remember when Double Fine took a year to release the second half of Broken Age and it was 98% reused assets?
[2:27:23] <cheapdoc> Based on the Phat bonus it gives you
[2:27:25] <%sileo_patronus> @Jaxnos Largely
[2:27:31] <fugly_nick> is Greatwood gone?
[2:27:32] <%SWFanatic> bone it out
[2:27:33] <GuyverTypeL> bruuuuuuh
[2:27:35] <$Jaxnos> niiiice
[2:27:38] <%bevyrage> tanks in resident evil games have never had tank controls, it's almost like a running joke at this point
[2:27:42] <BliVru> New weapons in altar
[2:27:51] <Eightesu> @DrkJP520 probably because they were hired by Sony
[2:27:51] <Too_Much_Nukie> @fugly_nick No this shortcut/thingy was always here.
[2:27:58] <Wydamn> breh
[2:27:59] <thekingjanglesbible> nah you could always go down there before greatwood
[2:28:03] <%ironohki> @fugly_nick This area is accessible before you fight Greatwood. That was in the regular game.
[2:28:07] <GuyverTypeL> There was a tank in Dino Crisis 2 tho
[2:28:08] <shotgang86> hmmm
[2:28:10] <$Jaxnos> i thought that's what you said
[2:28:11] <Too_Much_Nukie> There's only 2 bosses that are gone and one is only sort of gone.
[2:28:12] <fugly_nick> @Too_Much_Nukie Even in Vanilla? I never knew about that
[2:28:14] <%SWFanatic> hmm
[2:28:14] <%baronblank> LUL
[2:28:15] <%ironohki> @fugly_nick For covenant.
[2:28:15] <%NateyBeak> no pat, thats what Zangeif wants
[2:28:15] <Mudstone12> which is fine by me oh yeah
[2:28:16] <%BoxNavy> nice B)
[2:28:16] <%barrakuta371> clip it
[2:28:16] <+thelonechris> Quick, put dicks in him
[2:28:19] <penitentpendant> You HAVE been streaming with Plague today
[2:28:20] <cheapdoc> Jiji diqs
[2:28:21] <DrkJP520> @Eightesu Could be
[2:28:24] <Wydamn> Dick Souls
[2:28:25] <%LeiaSkynoober> Is it wrong to want dicks tho
[2:28:26] <%RealThiele> penis
[2:28:29] <%SirGO0SE> gotta have those dix
[2:28:33] <Profmcstevie> Gief is the dick lover please
[2:28:33] <dekkitout> This dex build does big crit
[2:28:36] <$Jaxnos> that's a slutty uchi
[2:28:49] <%big_boss_baby> dicks are underrated
[2:28:54] <%SirGO0SE> uchi's been a bad girl
[2:28:55] <KosOrSomeSayKosm_> with that the dancer might be doable-ish
[2:28:56] <Wydamn> Ashen One, I can grant you power after you gain one thousand dicks
[2:29:05] <homestylewaffles> sharp as a suit
[2:29:14] <zugzwane> hey @PatStaresAt ,how are you enjoying the cinders mod?
[2:29:24] <WorldFapRevealed> Why is Pat playing as Nick Mullen?
[2:29:27] <fugly_nick> He might be able to beat Dancer with that extra Estus
[2:29:28] <BliVru> Can you check the other Bonfire functions?
[2:29:32] <Wydamn> Oh no, I died and have dropped all my dicks at that tough boss.
[2:29:36] <cheapdoc> More like two hand these nuts
[2:29:38] <Profmcstevie> "Bro your gains are too small haha"
[2:29:39] <%Dakuu75> that's literally the only reason I level str for that too
[2:29:43] <%big_boss_baby> There should be an option to turn that off
[2:29:46] <+fetrigon> ye
[2:30:02] <%captain_kirkhammer> yes
[2:30:04] <%goose_attack_almanac> nah
[2:30:09] <mario_Sif> no
[2:30:17] <Wydamn> Can she do the box step? That's the only dance I know.
[2:30:19] <Too_Much_Nukie> I really like Dancer's armor too.
[2:30:21] <dekkitout> By normal people standards, perhaps
[2:30:21] <Profmcstevie> It's only weird if the pet does not respond
[2:30:24] <BliVru> No... it's you who's going down
[2:30:28] <%big_boss_baby> psaWink yes psaWink
[2:30:32] <shotgang86> check dat booty
[2:30:39] <fugly_nick> So far so good
[2:30:44] <%WhereIsWill> literally in delebrum while watching this lol
[2:30:53] <LtBoiii> damn uchi okay
[2:30:56] <TheHeroAppears> you got slapped
[2:30:57] <GuyverTypeL> That armor is fucking SICK holy shit
[2:31:01] <%LaughingCatt> stab her bum with your big dex
[2:31:02] <$Ziegsy> @WhereIsWill savage?
[2:31:08] <%Frost_Quill> I didn't know she could bitch slap the player wtf.
[2:31:17] <Too_Much_Nukie> @PatStaresAt With sharp weapons it's better to do 2 light attacks than 1 heavy because of the damage increase. Avoid using your R2 most of the time.
[2:31:33] <shotgang86> speeeeeen
[2:31:34] <Eightesu> two swords
[2:31:45] <%Deft_Thought> It's BEYBLAAAADE
[2:31:46] <%thedankestmeeme> HONEEYY I'M BUSYYY
[2:32:02] <Jolly_Adventurer> NO, I CAN'T PAUSE THE GAME
[2:32:04] <Jaysky> That booty tho
[2:32:07] <+twohitgood> does cinders make her swords good?
[2:32:14] <%MechArch> KomodoHype KomodoHype KomodoHype
[2:32:14] <+Shady_Zaku> LET'S BEYBLAAAADE, BEYBLAAAADE
[2:32:15] <cheapdoc> Dancer is too cool man
[2:32:20] <Too_Much_Nukie> No it isn't Pat lol.
[2:32:24] <fugly_nick> You can totally do it
[2:32:25] <%SWFanatic> nt
[2:32:27] <GuyverTypeL> F
[2:32:32] <Krash_Override> LET EM RIP!
[2:32:32] <%LaughingCatt> might need better Estus
[2:32:34] <Too_Much_Nukie> The beyblade move does more based on how far you are from her.
[2:32:35] <KosOrSomeSayKosm_> yeah, almost
[2:32:38] <shotgang86> its doable
[2:32:41] <AoiRob> you can do it
[2:32:42] <tanarath> ok, go do Paige's thing now, Pat
[2:33:19] <Too_Much_Nukie> Pat has missed a couple estus shards he can get now. Like marrying Solaire.
[2:33:28] <$sleepystardewfarmer> because he loves her 🥲
[2:33:39] <LtBoiii> stop that dancin
[2:33:40] <Eightesu> its a war of attition
[2:34:01] <StarlitStunner> She do have a butt tho
[2:34:02] <Too_Much_Nukie> It's a war of dat ass
[2:34:03] <fugly_nick> It's always a bad feeling in Souls games when your subsequent attempts on a boss go worse than your first attempt
[2:34:26] <BliVru> Get the grass shield first
[2:34:30] <shotgang86> need to level up adaptability
[2:34:35] <GuyverTypeL> too small and weak
[2:34:38] <Too_Much_Nukie> But hole ahead therefore, try thrusting attacks
[2:34:39] <DrkJP520> Paige, you got any tips for Pat?
[2:34:43] <KosOrSomeSayKosm_> some more stamina and like 1 more estus would probably do it
[2:34:44] <JehutyVer2> does uchi keep its running attack?
[2:34:54] <$Ziegsy> can we see?
[2:34:58] <%MechArch> not enuff stamina to satisfy that booty
[2:35:04] <%AzureGale> A big English loaf
[2:35:05] <Too_Much_Nukie> It has the two hit horizontal slash attack.
[2:35:11] <%KeiganOfAstora> LUL
[2:35:17] <tanarath> Paige, remember to give Pat helpful tips.
[2:35:23] <dekkitout> Death by bread, that gypsy fortune teller was right
[2:35:37] <shotgang86> I think he needs more estus, not stamina
[2:35:47] <shotgang86> because, well, he is going to get hit
[2:36:09] <%Lizard0TM> I wonder if Pat would ever try The Convergence or Champion's Ashes mods for DS3
[2:36:31] <%Lizard0TM> those are also huge overhauls with tons of new armor, weapons, bosses, areas, etc
[2:37:34] <ohkayNiko> champion's is ridiculously difficult
[2:37:46] <Krash_Override> was that a time crisis "reload"?
[2:38:11] <ohkayNiko> but it adds so much to the game as far as attacks
[2:38:13] <%AzureGale> nyannHypers nyannHypers nyannHypers
[2:38:31] <%YakumoYomi> I think Pat did a one-off of Convergence before. As for CA, their changes have been...inconsistent recently. I hear the main PvE modder left the team recently, but can't confirm.
[2:39:09] <+coffeebearCafe> for the neckbeards
[2:39:12] <penitentpendant> "Content" is more important than "Difficulty" in my opinion
[2:39:18] <%Lizard0TM> Chapions ashes is just an overhaul with MORE content than Cinders
[2:39:21] <ohkayNiko> one thing i absolutely LOVE about champion's ashes is the Bloodborne weapons
[2:39:33] <ohkayNiko> they actually function
[2:39:33] <%Issun135> champions of ash apparently has working trick weapons
[2:39:35] <ohkayNiko> the trick weapons
[2:39:49] <%Tman451> I wish more DS enemies talked shit like that
[2:39:51] <%BoxNavy> shhhh :)
[2:39:52] <ohkayNiko> it plays great to be honest
[2:40:00] <GuyverTypeL> ashiekConcern
[2:40:00] <Eightesu> whats the spoil tho
[2:40:07] <cheapdoc> Shit, I kindda wanna play Cinders now
[2:40:09] <JehutyVer2> away! away!
[2:40:13] <%KeiganOfAstora> Nothing in Dark Souls has a definitive answer
[2:40:14] <%Lizard0TM> Champions Ashes also have functional trick weapons with full movesets
[2:40:17] <fugly_nick> It's very Yharnamite like
[2:40:20] <%Frost_Quill> AWAY AWAY
[2:40:26] <%ahomeschooldropout> Remember that part towards the end of DS9 where Worf gets put into a tournament arc against the Jem H'Dar
[2:40:31] <BliVru> Even the remake felt quite nuttered
[2:40:32] <%patriotrenegade> Thats why i love Bloodborne
