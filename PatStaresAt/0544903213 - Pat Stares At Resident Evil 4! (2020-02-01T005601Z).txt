[0:21:35] <@commanderclaw> Yeah, the GM should have been able to improvise, but it's still murderhobo shit
[0:21:37] <%StaceMcGate> @AngriestPat this is what opinions get you
[0:21:39] <%Dragovus> both are correct

[0:21:45] <%0dokuro> They were just making excuses
[0:21:45] <%skeletor42069> both are accurate
[0:21:50] <+tweedler92> A good dm makes or breaks a game

[0:21:56] <+DesertPenguin> @AngriestPat What console are you playing RE4 on?
[0:21:57] <TheArrow_> some NPCs are definitely more important than others
[0:21:58] <guardian_collin> ah yes the objectively worst RE game
[0:21:58] <%Pappajimbo> as a former dm you need to be good at improvisoing
[0:22:00] <rempai1> will you ever play dungeons and dragons on stream?
[0:22:01] <%InugamiTheHound> @AngriestPat should I play PoE1 or just skip it and go to PoE2??

[0:22:11] <kindashagg> THAT dude
[0:22:12] <%thegreenbenis> THAT GUY
[0:22:12] <%RubberFistFight> @AngriestPat Honestly to me it sounds like the DM just massively fucked up, maybe you didn't have a session 0, and he didn't want to take responsibility for not ensuring that plot-vital NPCs didn't have some kind of protection. Easier to just play "blame the new guy".
[0:22:15] <@ShockzNDrawe> Pat you're roleplaying right now
[0:22:16] <%GeneralSCPatton> BIG STATS
[0:22:19] <%theKingRamses> flexing in the tavern while everyone else discusses plans

[0:22:25] <nivlac_555> lol
[0:22:27] <%bluebiscuit94> Honestly when you are a GM having players do stuff like that is just them doing the work for you and getting into trouble
[0:22:27] <+dayz1003> just like irl

[0:22:33] <nevan0> thats good
[0:22:35] <$TRILLTURBAN> Tbh that works
[0:22:36] <+A_mere_shrubb> My rule as a DM is that if they are THAT important then they shouldn't be that easy to kill
[0:22:37] <lionmanguy> Probably actually just get kicked
[0:22:37] <sakeydo> When this happen?

[0:22:42] <%StaceMcGate> @AngriestPat did you see the virginwoolie vs chadpat DND character sheet?
[0:22:43] <%MrDonTacos_> yep, sounds like an asshole
[0:22:44] <+onlystrykerfan> atpLook
[0:22:44] <%MegaPenPen> *that* is power gaming
[0:22:44] <cherrycottontail> Not fine actually
[0:22:47] <%asgard147> that's fine to be honest
[0:22:49] <Plague_bagel> now thats passive agressive roleplaying
[0:22:49] <redrins> just say your char is doing image training
[0:22:52] <%majima666> "infinite ammo" - points at bandanna
[0:22:53] <$Dakuu75> sounds canon
[0:22:54] <EuropanLamprey> That works till they roll to steal your stuff while your not looking

[0:22:58] <%unclekulikov> Lets roll with that. A good GM will incorporate that into their game by starting with buy-in.

[0:23:23] <+keyoray> As long as the real life person care, I'm down
[0:23:27] <%TheShortSwede> TheShortSwede subscribed at Tier 1. They've subscribed for 14 months! Hey this again I like this.BTW have you seen that some kind soul has dropped the Yakuza stage play on YouTube WITH SUBS! (pls pet the baby.)
[0:23:28] <kindashagg> That character still usually has an angle
[0:23:30] <lionmanguy> No, not to the degree you're thinking of. There might be aloof characters, but every well written one still cares about the story in some way
[0:23:32] <%0dokuro> You can hate it, thats fine, but theres really nothing wrong with a character like that long as they arent just straight trying to kill their companions.
[0:23:33] <%Pappajimbo> because Kanye is a giant yo
[0:23:34] <chaospudding> @Pappajimbo that's EXACTLY what I wanted to reference
[0:23:39] <cherrycottontail> Pat, that's like being the guy in the raid who doesn't feel like doing his button combo
[0:23:39] <%MrDonTacos_> yeah but their character is an asshole not the player
[0:23:41] <%RNGbob> @AngriestPat The shittier move was separating from the party. I can see how that could kill the flow of a game apatBougie
[0:23:41] <$saladin1911> DBD?
[0:23:45] <%BallerSwagBro9k> Doc from Rainbow 6?
[0:23:46] <Brother_Coduss> @AngriestPat congratulations, you are the sauske of the group
[0:23:50] <%armandolorian> apatCanada apatCanada
[0:23:55] <%Sora20030c> didnt they add more loops or something to leery's? Looks hella nice tho
[0:23:57] <Sheepeze> Use the time to pre-look up what ever spells you are going to ues, to make later combat easier.
[0:23:58] <%luftraumm1> yeah, my dm used to just leave the apathetic murder hobo in the tavern forever
[0:23:59] <%Sir_stride> YUP SAME
[0:24:01] <%zoddtheimmortal138> I love how much people hate you for this like why it is roll play. the last podcast was uncomfortable woolieSMUG apatBougie
[0:24:03] <%terminallyCapriciousz> @AngriestPat the problem with playing a character who doesn't give a single shit in D&D is that the story is almost entirely driven by the players. If you're not trying, you're not playing. And when you're not playing, might as well not be there.
[0:24:03] <graemecrackers1> How about the Han re-Work for F&F9
[0:24:08] <%tiaramaki> @saladin1911 Dead By Daylight
[0:24:10] <%luftraumm1> while the party went on adventures
[0:24:11] <@commanderclaw> Then just download PDFs and read them
[0:24:12] <%bluebiscuit94> OUCH
[0:24:13] <+sunny_side_up> we dont talk about thac0
[0:24:13] <TonberryLives> I think it's more about your inability to be creative in a non-academic sense.
[0:24:18] <%GarbageNirvana> Fuckin thac0
[0:24:20] <%Pappajimbo> fucking thaco
[0:24:27] <%Arxel1> Pat would probably like 4th ED LUL
[0:24:28] <0rond> oh no!!!
[0:24:29] <$saladin1911> @tiaramaki Ah, cheers
[0:24:29] <%Deadpal> Remember pat.
[0:24:30] <%BallerSwagBro9k> D&D is boring and complicated. I prefer RPG games
[0:24:31] <%luftraumm1> fuck thac0
[0:24:31] <%StaceMcGate> It's a guide
[0:24:32] <floatRand> It's issue is just that it doesn't translate into group games where you are supposed to sort of mingle and have these sort of ping-ponging. But I suppose Pat does things how Pat does - more Dungeon Crawly man.
[0:24:32] <$Dakuu75> lol
[0:24:32] <%RubberFistFight> People play self-serving Chaotic Neutral all the goddamn time, stop acting like that some kind of massive evil on Pat's part. Sure, if he was running around setting towns on fire and actively and maliciously killing people for no reason and starting PvP combat? Yeah, that'd be a problem. But if "chaotic neutral" wasn't allowed for players, they wouldn't let you pick it.
[0:24:33] <%theKingRamses> get fucked
[0:24:34] <oniwahoo> There is a lot of cool shit in D&D
[0:24:34] <AFlyingTaco1> What is thaco?
[0:24:35] <%Deadpal> Imagination isn't just "anything" it CAN BE
[0:24:35] <42nfl19> It depends on teh group
[0:24:36] <%cvp5127> ru rur ru ru
[0:24:36] <+theodolitejones> Pat you would live Five Torches Deep
[0:24:37] <%Ranryu692> it's tips & tricks
[0:24:38] <@commanderclaw> They're guidelines
[0:24:39] <+theodolitejones> Its alll about the rules
[0:24:39] <%Sir_stride> that's understandable a bit
[0:24:41] <%Deadpal> but it isn't necessarily
[0:24:41] <@ShockzNDrawe> AH SHIT HERE WE GO AGAIN
[0:24:41] <0rond> they are more like guidelines
[0:24:41] <%BallerSwagBro9k> apatGoblin apatGoblin apatGoblin apatGoblin
[0:24:42] <lionmanguy> Honestly, just play more rpg games then. Like not even as an insult they're probably more for you
[0:24:43] <%majima666> never appealed to me D&D, i was never big on the whole medieval thing. i wont knock people who do like it
[0:24:43] <+theodolitejones> and strict number crunching
[0:24:44] <%Dragovus> The book is for guidance
[0:24:45] <Brother_Coduss> GUIDELINES
[0:24:45] <+sunny_side_up> do you not have house rules in monopoly
[0:24:45] <chaospudding> D&D rules are more like the pirate code than actual laws
[0:24:45] <%Sora20030c> the rules are more like guidelines, really
[0:24:46] <daisyyyy> thac0 helped me work out algebra
[0:24:46] <Peculiar_Pangolin> You can make your own ruleset
[0:24:46] <%maskedriderhero> Pat is a munchkin, a player who cares solely for the stats and roll aspects of the game, rather than the roleplaying aspects
[0:24:48] <Dova573> RULES ARE MENT TO BE BROKEN
[0:24:48] <+theodolitejones> managing resources and such
[0:24:48] <%Deadpal> you can bend the rules if the story is fun
[0:24:48] <%Dr_Mooose> imagination within guidelines
[0:24:49] <%StaceMcGate> It's a template to build off of
[0:24:51] <%bluebiscuit94> So you like Crunch heavy games, rather than narrative style games like FATE
[0:24:51] <JonEWorldbeater> G U I D E
[0:24:52] <%Wallabri> enter chat and immediately lowers face into hands........
[0:24:54] <CamiHeart> Rules are made to be broken!
[0:24:54] <Plague_bagel> but muh goblins
[0:24:54] <cureneckbeard> That statement is to cover the DM's ass when he forgets most of the rules, so you can't defy his authority by waving a book around
[0:24:55] <cherrycottontail> It's telling you that you can do things outside the rules, and that sometimes you have to fudge it
[0:24:56] <%GarbageNirvana> Yeah Pat would be a 4th Ed dude for sure
[0:24:56] <%Arrior_Septem> For structure
[0:24:58] <floatRand> Pat would like 1st/2nd edition stuff.
[0:24:58] <+theodolitejones> Five Torches Deep
[0:25:00] <%majima666> i mean i like fucking wrestling so, im not gonna knock people who like d&d lol
[0:25:00] <%Pappajimbo> the universe will obey me
[0:25:02] <Dumple_Roe> isn't it that kinda a point?
[0:25:04] <%ha2ken> Is it weird that I like reading through the manuals, but not really like the game itself? cmonBruh cmonBruh
[0:25:04] <%Dr_DangerPhD> Pat its literally telling you that you can be flexible in service of the story
[0:25:04] <Peculiar_Pangolin> That's how most people do it
[0:25:04] <Marpolo13> get rkt nerd LUL
[0:25:04] <@commanderclaw> That's a legit style
[0:25:04] <%bluebiscuit94> That's just being fair
[0:25:05] <brutalgenie> play kingdom death with woolie!
[0:25:05] <0rond> that's legitimate
[0:25:05] <%Arxel1> Just make a new character dude 4Head
[0:25:06] <%asgard147> "AM I THE ONLY PERSON WHO CARES ABOUT THE RULES?!" apatGoblin
[0:25:06] <chaospudding> Would you at least let them roll up a new character?
[0:25:07] <%AMajorTom> dogs and cats living together --- total anarchy!
[0:25:07] <%vectorless_peon> the rules are guidelines
[0:25:07] <%RubberFistFight> @AngriestPat which is perfectly fair, btw. That's literally how that shit works.
[0:25:07] <+tweedler92> Roll a new character fucko
[0:25:08] <%Flambage> @AngriestPat The rules are for people without imagination like you
[0:25:08] <%armandolorian> apatFist
[0:25:08] <%Razputin217> THERE MUST BE ORDER
[0:25:09] <0rond> a lot of DM's do that
[0:25:09] <%RNGbob> think of it of freedom, but in a huge box
[0:25:10] <%theKingRamses> pat would probably like kingdom death
[0:25:10] <%Mariakko> Stick to video games
[0:25:10] <42nfl19> @AngriestPat The rules are like a framework/guide which is agreed upon the group.
[0:25:10] <Brother_Coduss> If you were DMing it would be nonstop combat, there wouldnt be any cliffs
[0:25:10] <%snow_bush> Rules can't fix everything.
[0:25:10] <%Ganerumo> There are DMs who are like fucking calculators and who abide by the rules perfectly and it makes for fun games
[0:25:10] <Yummy_Nukes> @angriestpat there more like guidelines
[0:25:12] <%Garthunox> that's fair
[0:25:13] <Goergorion> this is what Hero Points are for
[0:25:13] <%bevyrage> that mention at the end of the book is to allow leway for DM's to use if they want. it's not for players to decide what rules are followed unless the DM is cooperative.
[0:25:13] <floatRand> Probably. More dungeon crawly. Prepare multiple characters and die whenever
[0:25:14] <$Dakuu75> damn straight
[0:25:15] <damascussteele> I hate it when dm dont know the rules
[0:25:16] <%luftraumm1> chaotic neutral is super valid, but it is NOT a free pass to be a jerk
[0:25:16] <42nfl19> That is a fair thing
[0:25:17] <PlumpPotatoRump> thatz totally fine. youre DM lol
[0:25:18] <%UncleAWOL> That is a style DMs go with yeah
[0:25:19] <+TheBigTaco> Pat enjoys going against logic
[0:25:21] <0rond> that's super legitimate
[0:25:22] <%damienlunas> Because sometimes the rules are shit and didn't account for the players making an anti-matter bomb using eschew materials and create object.
[0:25:22] <Dova573> What you are saying is that you would be a rules lawyer
[0:25:23] <%albedo455> new sanic the movie Teaser

[0:25:24] <+Tevvy> thats how most people play i dont see what your problem is
[0:25:24] <Reizie_Etherealm> Pat doesn't want a direction, he need a GPS
[0:25:25] <%asgard147> that's pretty fair to be honest

[0:25:28] <%Garthunox> zifnab
[0:25:30] <%RubberFistFight> @luftraumm1 yeah. Chaotic neutral is fine. Chaotic dumbass is not.
[0:25:32] <oniwahoo> "Never let your party roll for something you're not prepared for them to fail"
[0:25:32] <chaospudding> you can totally do that pat, it's a valid way to DM
[0:25:32] <%Arxel1> @AngriestPat Just add Jr to your name and say your mission is to avenge your pa
[0:25:33] <Huntercd> That makes sense
[0:25:34] <$R3Roundabout> Iy's just a way to let people know you can opt out of dumb rules and homebrew new ones.

[0:26:12] <%RubberFistFight> @AngriestPat if someone on the team has the spell AND the mats, sure. At 8 mionutes into the campaign though they're not going to, so jokes on them.
[0:26:13] <cureneckbeard> Pat would make a great DM

[0:26:56] <lionmanguy> Or, alternatively, try playing one of the games that has rules that push minmaxers to playing the type of character the game wants
[0:26:56] <%RubberFistFight> If you make that a table rule at the very start of the campaign, it's totally fair.

[0:27:46] <cureneckbeard> aye
[0:27:46] <%Roundelay11> you can comprehend it, but not actually understand it
[0:27:47] <KingGoblodyte> YUP
[0:27:47] <BoneofMalkav> 80% possible
[0:27:48] <Nina96> its usually is
[0:27:48] <%ha2ken> You can understand something and still hate it yes.
[0:27:48] <%Ranryu692> Yeah, I play D&D and Dialect sounded pretty bad
[0:27:49] <%Kegeto> it happens
[0:27:50] <%Mr_Pylon> I mean, play in a game that let's you be a big dumb
[0:27:50] <EySoyCoco> whatta you buyin'
[0:27:53] <%ultimatetotoro> yes
[0:27:53] <%Deadpal> Part of the point of DND is to write a story with characters together. It's like writing a good story and having fun together. Yes the stories they're writing might be something you don't like. Dialect isn't a bad game when played with people who enjoy writing stories together.
[0:27:54] <%UncleAWOL> I had 0 interest in that Dialect game as Woolie was describing it
[0:27:54] <%klholland92> Yeah kinda
[0:27:55] <%snow_bush> yes
[0:27:56] <accusedphoenix> you roleplay with paige right?
[0:27:59] <%RubberFistFight> @luftraumm1 well, chaotic neutral if it's actually being played correctly, still has quite a few rules to how it works. You still have to have SOME SEMBLANCE of a morality - "insane murder hobo" doesn't count.
[0:28:00] <0rond> I love DND but dialect sounds not fun at all
[0:28:00] <%cvp5127> fair
[0:28:00] <%Sir_stride> Yes
[0:28:01] <shardlab> You get to roll for combat for the enemies. Don't talk. just fight
[0:28:03] <+soundcloud_raptor> IM DA GIANT PAT THAT MAKES ALL OF DA ROOOLS
[0:28:03] <%BallerSwagBro9k> You roleplay a leprechaun all the time tho
[0:28:07] <morningmoondude> If you're creative, you'll think like 60% of other creative endeavors are garbo.
[0:28:08] <+Tevvy> your problem is you're always going too broad
[0:28:08] <%AMajorTom> gatekeeper Pat is to cerebral for you dummies
[0:28:08] <+OwlLightningMage> You just acted like a DM right now. That's the stuff DMs do
[0:28:08] <%DukeMoose> dont you like the book thats 80% preechiness and barely 20% rules?
[0:28:08] <JonEWorldbeater> Or maybe you're just an asshole
[0:28:09] <Zaphire_Saucypants> different strokes for different folks.
[0:28:10] <%Sir_stride> we finally cracked the code.
[0:28:11] <%BionoidLCR> it was boring to watch imo
[0:28:12] <%Dragon_Batman> Because people think it is fun for them, that is it
[0:28:12] <floatRand> Pat's good ol' grognard.
[0:28:13] <%0dokuro> You just a cynical fuck, but you good either way.
[0:28:14] <%Reaverund> There's no big number in RP'ing
[0:28:15] <shardlab> We'll call you when the mooks roll up
[0:28:16] <%Monkeyweed21> You roleplay as a human being everyday
[0:28:16] <%Roundelay11> DORF
[0:28:17] <%BallerSwagBro9k> LUL LUL LUL
[0:28:17] <+MisterCrimson> @AngriestPat he uploaded the first episdoe and it's almost 2 hours of just setting up the context of the game. Not my waffle house
[0:28:17] <TonberryLives> More than likely yes. You just STRONGLY prefer something with more defined limitations.
[0:28:17] <panic_rabbit> Would you enjoy making up fantasy insults though?
[0:28:17] <%StaceMcGate> LOTR Fantasy is generally boring and hackney
[0:28:20] <%patriotrenegade> You're rigtht tho, Dialect sounded lame af
[0:28:21] <%Reaverund> You just like being the rat in the maze
[0:28:22] <Lajong_z> he rollplays a normal human
[0:28:23] <+dayz1003> you roleplay the mayor from the wizard of ozz
[0:28:24] <%majima666> he IS a leprachaun
[0:28:24] <Zaphire_Saucypants> structure IS nice
[0:28:25] <oniwahoo> Pat doesn't ROLE-PLAY a leprechaun
[0:28:26] <Yummy_Nukes> SQUATS
[0:28:26] <%ssjklyco> Why create a stream. have someone else do a better stream
[0:28:26] <%MrDonTacos_> I dont like it = it's terrible by default
[0:28:26] <%luftraumm1> it does sound a bit up ones own ass
[0:28:27] <%Psych_man13_13> You role play a human being
[0:28:27] <@ShockzNDrawe> Pat we all know you're a closet gremlin who snacks on candies in solitude, of course you think dialect is stupid
[0:28:29] <%Chatterbox1991> Its almost as if you should get some goddamn sleep before the Podcast, pat. @AngriestPat
[0:28:30] <%GarbageNirvana> I feel like that game would be good to play in order to set up a world for a different game
[0:28:33] <%Ganerumo> @AngriestPat there is a tabletop RPG called Paranoia and you'd love itr
[0:28:35] <%Sir_stride> SAME
[0:28:36] <0rond> pat you can't antagonize us when you are right and we all aree with you @AngriestPat
[0:28:36] <%bluebiscuit94> Fair, but that's a stance that most people don't think about, because it's often used dishonestly
[0:28:37] <%cvp5127> same
[0:28:38] <%Sir_stride> HARD SAME
[0:28:40] <Sheepeze> Very
[0:28:41] <%Deadpal> god same though
[0:28:44] <chaospudding> big same
[0:28:44] <%Aydarkzero> oh...
[0:28:45] <brutalgenie> @angriestpat what is your opinion on kingdom death monster?
[0:28:45] <%patriotrenegade> You want to be ordered around? @AngriestPat
[0:28:45] <shardlab> Sit on your phone until the enemy arrives
[0:28:46] <kindashagg> "feel free to get bored"
[0:28:46] <42nfl19> There is an ending, KILL THE DRAGON
[0:28:47] <%theKingRamses> yep
[0:28:48] <%GarbageNirvana> Yeah
[0:28:48] <%rytisone> defeat THE DRAGON
[0:28:49] <Marpolo13> TOO much freedom for Pat
[0:28:49] <%Arxel1> Big same energy
[0:28:49] <%armandolorian> fuuuuuuuuck Minecraft
[0:28:50] <%BallerSwagBro9k> NOT ANYMORE PAT
[0:28:50] <the_sprankton> there are mods that make beating the game more interesting
[0:28:51] <%uncletwistyfresh> I HAVE ARRIVED
[0:28:52] <%Dr_Mooose> I got to that point too
[0:28:53] <%pectusumbra> Hey, just a heads up, Clair de Lune, one of the big modders for Darkest Dungeon is in a really rough spot and could use some support
[0:28:53] <%Reaverund> Filling a void through vidya
[0:28:55] <%patriotrenegade> PAT NEEDS A DOM
[0:28:55] <%asgard147> I have that issue as well
[0:28:56] <chaospudding> killing the dragon is booooooring though
[0:28:56] <%StaceMcGate> How do you win at life Pat?
[0:28:57] <0rond> pat you can't antagonize us when you are right and we all agree with you @AngriestPat
[0:28:58] <%BallerSwagBro9k> THE GAME HAS CHANGED
[0:29:00] <+Target616> Dialect sounded like a weird middle ground between a game and free-form rping
[0:29:01] <%majima666> but i want to shoot the thing though
[0:29:02] <%rontopronto> Minecraft = Dumb
[0:29:03] <%Roundelay11> play Dragon Quest Builders then, it's better Minecraft with a completable actual story
[0:29:04] <oniwahoo> @angriestpat That is the exact reason I don't like Minecraft, give me some structure damn you!
[0:29:05] <+Tevvy> you want someone else to tell you what to do
[0:29:05] <%joylent_blue> it was neat seeing Woolie and gang do what they wanted to with Dialect, but if i was in the game i'd be bored to death
[0:29:06] <Zaphire_Saucypants> I'm the same way actually. Every time I play I get to a point where I'm just bored cuz there's no actual end goal. Just get access to more blocks.
[0:29:06] <%Dragon_Batman> You want a goal point that is interesting to you
[0:29:07] <+Jumpie8> just set things on fire
[0:29:13] <%Deadpal> Play a survival mode then and survive as long as you can then
[0:29:13] <%ssjklyco> The only good part of Minecraft is when you uninstall it
[0:29:13] <%WhereIsWill> pat needs his quest log in the game
[0:29:13] <%AMajorTom> you beat it by keeping Patton Oswald safe
[0:29:14] <%dasmause> @AngriestPat are you the type of person who hates speedruns because theyre not the intended way to play?
[0:29:14] <timblenaut> minecraft is creative
[0:29:15] <%pectusumbra> You want Terraria, 100% @AngriestPat
[0:29:16] <Lajong_z> Mining and exploring is also fun
[0:29:16] <%MrDonTacos_> imagine hating on minecraft
[0:29:17] <%RubberFistFight> @AngriestPat you ever played Terraria? It's a little like 2D minecraft, but it also has actual bosses, and a path from the start to the final boss, as well as upgrade paths to follow for gear and stuff.
[0:29:17] <%GarbageNirvana> Too often I find myself looking for end goals in games like that
[0:29:18] <%theKingRamses> YEP
[0:29:19] <%BallerSwagBro9k> Minecraft has gotten way better
[0:29:20] <%Psyramics> thats 7 days to die
[0:29:22] <%Mekhet09> Play terraria then.
[0:29:22] <Rawklobstah88> Isn't that Fable 3?
[0:29:23] <EuropanLamprey> Just build a hole in the mountain and collect every material in the game, good goeal
[0:29:23] <muniea3> thats literally Dragon Quest Builders
[0:29:23] <0rond> the goal of minecraft is kill the dragon
[0:29:24] <%silver_madness> Hey Pat I've started playing RE4 and Silent Hill 2 and now I'm getting bitten by the survival horror bug. I'm about to play RE1 remake on a GameCube emulator
[0:29:24] <%Roundelay11> Dragon Quest Builders
[0:29:24] <+ckangaroo15k> Play Terraria then.
[0:29:26] <nepneptech> That's dragon quest builders 2 or terraria
[0:29:27] <+Tevvy> essentially nothing is of value to you unless someone else said its the valuable thing that you're supposed to do, you cannot bestow value to goals yourself
[0:29:28] <%UncleAWOL> Lots of the bigger mods in Minecraft have tech trees that you build towards cool shit
[0:29:28] <%SilverFaustX> pat the creative artist
[0:29:28] <%Takreth> !uptime
[0:29:29] <@Moobot> I've been playing this game for how long? Oh only 29m 30s.
[0:29:30] <TheArrow_> yeah, dragon quest builders is waaay better in that regard
[0:29:33] <%StaceMcGate> LEON, FUCK MY SISTER
[0:29:34] <%Agami23> but then you need food. and storage.
[0:29:35] <theangryguyofde> Pat can't imagine a party of a Dwarf mage who's intelligence modifier randomly reverses, a Tall Human Barbarian that has bad vision and constitution, and a Cat named Elmo. Because that feels a little too close to home.
[0:29:35] <%GeneralSCPatton> PLAY TERRARIA
[0:29:36] <%Psych_man13_13> So when are you going to stream Gmod?
[0:29:36] <%RNGbob> @AngriestPat but resources go up
[0:29:37] <chaospudding> terraria is way way better in terms of giving an end goal to work towards
[0:29:38] <%BallerSwagBro9k> Oh yeah Terraria is waaaaay betted

[0:29:51] <0rond> this is a rick and morty joke
[0:29:52] <TonberryLives> Booo
[0:29:52] <@ShockzNDrawe> all you have to do is tell people they can like it if they like it and people will shut up because the conversation is over at that point.
[0:29:53] <+Jumpie8> eww

[0:29:59] <%ElkRiverDog> Terraria
[0:29:59] <%CopperTucker> Bagooner
[0:29:59] <%ssjklyco> it's a weed out of 10
[0:30:01] <chaospudding> terraria is the only minecraft-esque game I've put over 10 hours into
[0:30:02] <+MisterCrimson> TOTAL GLOBAL INSEMINATION
[0:30:05] <morningmoondude> nah, it's like a 6.5/10
[0:30:05] <Reizie_Etherealm> Complete Redfield saturation
[0:30:06] <Nina96> 3/10 chris cant have kids ever
[0:30:10] <%fruit_pie_the_magician> I got attacked by a giant Tyrannosaur Mantis while trying to find alien cactus in No Mans Sky last night

[0:30:14] <%theKingRamses> WAIT HOW DOES INFECTING THE WORLD GET CLAIRE PERGANTE
[0:30:14] <%patriotrenegade> oh no
[0:30:17] <JonEWorldbeater> Pretty sure Leon is a eunuch
[0:30:18] <%linkster291> Yeah dialect is pretty much a game with no real win condition. Things like DND and most TRPGs at least have the idea of trying to reach some goal set by the story, but Dialect has no real goal, or purpose other than trying to tell a story.
[0:30:20] <oniwahoo> @zaphire_saucypants I bought Minecraft for Sky Factory because it has a sense of progression and as far as I can tell end state and apparently I bought the version that doesn't support mods so wooo
[0:30:22] <%storkeylope> @angriestpat You‚Äôre actually the first person I‚Äôve met who shares my view on Minecraft and other ‚Äúcreative games‚Äù
[0:30:28] <$ziriken> that was so the bet
[0:30:29] <%snow_bush> Should've been Chris hiring Ada to go collect it while he's over there.
[0:30:35] <chaospudding> @theKingRamses you aren't reading the right doujins
[0:30:35] <%fruit_pie_the_magician> Scared the shit out of me
[0:30:35] <cureneckbeard> it was sans vs doomguy in smash
[0:30:35] <%optimasmaximas> @patriotrenegade cause then the japanese cant pretend jill could someday be theirs
[0:30:42] <StuffHunter> Everything in Minecraft only has perceived value and it does a pretty poor job of delivering that.
[0:30:44] <%Th3SmartAlec> Oh great
[0:30:44] <$ziriken> was the spoiler real or not

[0:30:59] <$ziriken> it's 70% at best
[0:31:01] <%RubberFistFight> @ShockzNDrawe what I hate is when you're criticising something for valid reasons (e.g. the plot snarls in David Cage games), and someone comes along and acts like you're telling them they can't like it.
[0:31:07] <%Aydarkzero> so nothing valuable?

[0:34:56] <%monstergills> Persona 1 needs the remake
[0:35:01] <%Mekhet09> Atlus west was talking about wanting to remake it.
[0:35:06] <Deimos002> Now I'm hungry for Fsteak
[0:35:06] <%majima666> 3 and 4 hd remasters when?

[0:35:07] <zayasu> i'm sure ATLUS will listen Kappa

[0:35:08] <%skeletor42069> what's the quote?
[0:35:08] <sonofthedeepsouth> LUL
[0:35:09] <shiny_prinny> persona 1 and 2

[0:35:15] <%JohnAtDawn> YOU KNOW WHY
[0:35:16] <%patriotrenegade> I dont know anything about Persona, but Chie and, Kawakami and Takemi are cute
[0:35:16] <%Monkeyweed21> THOSE DONT EXIST
[0:35:17] <deviljhojho_> those games dont exist
[0:35:17] <%cvp5127> cause persona starts at 3 Kappa
[0:35:18] <%BallerSwagBro9k> Yep LUL
[0:35:18] <%joylent_blue> cuz ppl don't care about 1 and 2
[0:35:18] <$saladin1911> The music is the best part of Persona 3 tbh
[0:35:18] <Marpolo13> because worse?
[0:35:18] <%AmericanaRed> FUCK 1 AND 2
[0:35:18] <+dayz1003> just port 4 golden to ps4

[0:35:20] <floatRand> Exactly!
[0:35:21] <sonofthedeepsouth> BTFI
[0:35:22] <Nina96> whats 1 & 2?
[0:35:22] <%Psyramics> because there is no persona 1 or 2
[0:35:23] <+MisterCrimson> They did that already and they suck
[0:35:23] <Man_in_the_Red> because they would ruin 1 and 2 duology
[0:35:23] <%marsantas> Because Persona starts at 3
[0:35:25] <DusK_The_Stray> Pat, you KNOW Persona started at 3
[0:35:25] <sonofthedeepsouth> BTFO
[0:35:27] <+D00msDayDan> what are you talking about, persona starts at 3 just like ace combat
[0:35:28] <%startstoprepeat> persona 3 is persona 1
[0:35:28] <%skeletor42069> 1 and 2 ARE TRASH

[0:42:20] <floatRand> Pat, I wonder if you'd like P2. Its plot is great, no social links, slow combat and terrifying amount of OCD possibly. But it is on dead console...
[0:42:21] <$crown_clown22> no Yozora will be turned into VS13

[0:42:57] <%galaxyswirl> WRONG PAT
[0:43:00] <%BallerSwagBro9k> YES IT IS PAT
[0:43:03] <%SolidusRex> Persona 4 Golden Showers
[0:43:04] <%pectusumbra> Yes, maker of Moonlight dungeon
[0:43:07] <oniwahoo> I enjoyed Crystal Chronicles, but it takes some warming up to
[0:43:10] <%ultimatetotoro> mother fucker
[0:43:12] <%snow_bush> Its fantastic.
[0:43:13] <$Timesteel> it is if you aren‚Äôt bucket bitch
[0:43:14] <chaospudding> crystal chronicals is a fun game with friends, but its not a gooood game
[0:43:14] <%AncelDeLambert> DO NOT FEED THE GOBOLINS
[0:43:15] <%ElenaManetta> Dialect seems like a game for nerds
[0:43:18] <%trueherobappo> @BubbaRands You are a true hero.
[0:43:18] <%ElenaManetta> Like Chess.
[0:43:23] <%joylent_blue> its not pointless if you like story telling, but i sorta agree lol
[0:43:25] <%StaceMcGate> Imaginaaaaaation, Imaginaaaaaation

[0:43:41] <%RubberFistFight> @AngriestPat when my girlfriend overheard Woolie's description of "Dialect" she said "that just sounds like madlibs for dumbasses."
[0:43:41] <$Dakuu75> this sounds dangerous all ready
[0:43:42] <%bluebiscuit94> You know what else is bad? FATE (the system, not weeb cash cow)
[0:43:46] <sakeydo> Oh shit, I just realized thats the name of the fucking game.
[0:43:47] <thelonechris> Poopy Lore
[0:43:53] <%patriotrenegade> u aint wrong
[0:43:54] <%DeeTrz> I love DND and table top stuff, Dialect sounded awful to me
[0:43:54] <oniwahoo> @rubberfistfight Nice
[0:43:55] <TheArrow_> wait paige inspired loopy lore? holy shit
[0:43:55] <Haxzzer> savebeesFloss3 savebeesFloss2 savebeesFloss

[0:44:01] <ThatOneGuyYouSaw> sugoiSchleep
[0:44:10] <%Sora20030c> loopy lore sounds like so much fun when you guys talked about it before
[0:44:12] <%ElenaManetta> Loopy Lore is a more comedy game like ad-libs vs. a roleplaying game, which is what Dialect SOUNDS like, right?
[0:44:12] <$Dakuu75> lol
[0:44:20] <%0dokuro> GRAB THE IKNIFE
[0:44:21] <%GeneralSCPatton> HJ√ñNK
[0:44:22] <marvel877> Ducks quack, Pat
[0:44:26] <derap41> Ducks are the worst fucking birds
[0:44:29] <%Swampykins> The main page for that game has Woole in it.
[0:44:30] <%majima666> work that duckarse
[0:44:30] <Dova573> That linguist game seems to take itself a bit too serious is what I gathered
[0:44:31] <%MelBrooksKA> That's sounds like a completely different game tho...
[0:44:32] <haidanort> i ran into woolie at pax east when me and my friend were walking along the sidewalk to the con entrance and i started talking to him, should i have talked to him like i did or not
[0:44:33] <$Dakuu75> peace was never an option

[0:44:53] <%majima666> ducks are bastards though, they literally laugh at you
[0:44:54] <%Ranryu692> we used to quack at my principal in high school
[0:44:56] <%Garthunox> the duck have started to move
[0:44:57] <%bigdumbidiotguy> what the fuck is Loopy Lore
[0:44:57] <TonberryLives> That's still not about "winning" it's about continuing the combo, so to speak.
[0:44:57] <+robobeau> Why does a game require a win condition for you to have fun Pat?
[0:45:00] <sakeydo> sqwack!
[0:45:00] <+Jokobeast> HahaGoose HONKS ‚Üó
[0:45:00] <%0dokuro> The BARK goes "DUCK"

[0:45:07] <TheArrow_> FeMC is in that 3DS game
[0:45:08] <%cvp5127> shotas?
[0:45:08] <mMayrro> Marin Karin :)
[0:45:08] <%RubberFistFight> @ElenaManetta Dialect sounds like a game that doesn't know wtf it wants to be, made by a bunch of linguistic nerds who wanted to jerk themselves off over their superior understanding of the formation of and proliferation of dialectic language.
[0:45:11] <%joylent_blue> THATS ALL I WANT FROM PERSONA
[0:45:12] <%Garthunox> UH?
[0:45:15] <Reizie_Etherealm> The only problem I have with dialect is that I always come up with more ideas than the people I'm watching, so it's kinda unsatisfactory to watch but tolerable
[0:45:17] <%Dr_DangerPhD> Dialect just seems like a game built around storybuilding with peeps, which can be fun but isn't about "winning" in any respect
[0:45:19] <%Sir_stride> it's a goal
[0:45:20] <%nofestu2> this questions ass is deep
[0:45:20] <+DesertPenguin> Because video games?
[0:45:21] <mikesapartment> It's not a game if you can't win
[0:45:21] <%LaughingCatt> because otherwise its not a game
[0:45:22] <sonofthedeepsouth> DEEP ASS
[0:45:23] <%bigdumbidiotguy> I want to win
[0:45:23] <Peculiar_Pangolin> Games need objectives
[0:45:23] <Marpolo13> common goal
[0:45:25] <SGrim> Pat likes to win
[0:45:25] <%Sausious> YOU WANNA TALK ABOUT ATLUS PRETENDING PERSON THINGS EXIST? AND T H R E E IS YOUR EXAMPLE??
[0:45:25] <TheArrow_> there's nothing more fun than winning, mike
[0:45:26] <%MayShip> because thats life
[0:45:28] <%wrightlight94> Pretty much the goal
[0:45:30] <%ogtrashwizard> Using more of these points things because they are utterly worthless to me. What are we gonna see today, Pat?
[0:45:34] <%bigdumbidiotguy> GAMEPLAY
[0:45:35] <+DesertPenguin> A game needs to be completed
[0:45:35] <%GeneralSCPatton> Pat is the embodiment of "Are ya winnin', son?"
[0:45:35] <%Deadpal> what
[0:45:35] <Marpolo13> goal so you can feel accomplished about playing something
[0:45:36] <%SilverFaustX> dopamine
[0:45:37] <derap41> So Wow playing ?
[0:45:37] <%Deadpal> no
[0:45:38] <%sabertoothzombie> completion is success
[0:45:44] <haidanort> so pat doesn't enjoy the animal crossing?
[0:45:47] <%Dragon_Batman> Now what is succeeding to you?
[0:45:48] <$Dakuu75> the REALIST-real-talk
[0:45:50] <%Monkeyweed21> but you play mmos
[0:45:50] <%bigdumbidiotguy> Pat. you succeed in many tasks in open ended games
[0:45:50] <@ShockzNDrawe> well you win after a long time
[0:45:50] <%0dokuro> But what if you fail at playing
[0:45:51] <%Deadpal> A game is a structured form of play pat.
[0:45:51] <Marpolo13> play = ability to win
[0:45:52] <%StaceMcGate> @AngriestPat How do you beat FF14 Pat?
[0:45:52] <Eldalu> Is it bad that makes sense to me?
[0:45:54] <sonofthedeepsouth> COMPETITION IS CHAD
[0:45:55] <+ckangaroo15k> What's the winning condition of FF14 pat?
[0:45:57] <%fruit_pie_the_magician> Let's ball that dirt
[0:45:58] <+DesertPenguin> @AngriestPat Is it about success and failure or just completion?
[0:45:59] <%Deadpal> A game is a structured form of play.
[0:46:00] <%natebud> When a game doesn't have a goal, you usually end up setting your own goals anyway
[0:46:00] <%bigdumbidiotguy> hey, I succeeded in building a house
[0:46:02] <sonofthedeepsouth> STICK IN THE SAND
[0:46:03] <Man_in_the_Red> @stacemcgate theres a story
[0:46:04] <%pectusumbra> That's fair
[0:46:05] <%Mr_Pylon> Dwarf Fortress is play
[0:46:05] <oniwahoo> I don't want to play in a sandbox, but if you give me something specific to build I'll go at it
[0:46:06] <%Th3SmartAlec> ....no, because that's not what people mean when they say those things
[0:46:06] <floatRand> What about games with just losing condition?
[0:46:08] <damascussteele> Telephone is a game, truth or dare
[0:46:10] <daisyyyy> Yah Lets reduce human interaction to simplistic definitions!!
[0:46:10] <%bluebiscuit94> Doesn't that mean that most David Cage games AREN'T games?
[0:46:11] <Scorilla> @AngriestPat play terraria for big dopamine
[0:46:12] <%bigdumbidiotguy> hey I succeeded in finding diamonds
[0:46:12] <%Deadpal> it doesn't need to have a "win" in that situation.
[0:46:15] <derap41> Ludology class with Pat
[0:46:16] <%RubberFistFight> Dialect is the equivalent of a round bat with a rubber ball on a string attached to it. Sure, it's "fun" but ultimately fucking pointless.
[0:46:16] <chaospudding> you know what isn't a game? fucking chutes and ladders
[0:46:20] <Reizie_Etherealm> And your expectations are based on what you want right?
[0:46:20] <RatherUninteresting> dialect seemed like horse shit
[0:46:20] <%Gogogolem> Pats fun has to be organized.
[0:46:21] <+DesertPenguin> I get that
[0:46:21] <%Zulrez> so by that logic you would be down to play minecraft if you were told lets PLAY minecraft? Kappa
[0:46:21] <%asgard147> limesThink
[0:46:25] <Marpolo13> @bluebiscuit94 correct
[0:46:31] <%ElenaManetta> It's like playing a multiplayer game with NPCs. What's the point. It's not REAL PEOPLE you're destroying.
[0:46:35] <chaospudding> candy land is also not a game
[0:46:39] <%theKingRamses> DELICIOUS
[0:46:40] <fabo_joyful> play terraria for big dopamine
[0:46:46] <%bigdumbidiotguy> Play MegaMan Legends 2 immediately
[0:46:47] <@ShockzNDrawe> what
[0:46:49] <%asgard147> EAT THEM! limesEvil
[0:46:50] <%Dragon_Batman> That is being creative in some way right there
[0:46:52] <clonexsniperx> time to ask clemps?
[0:46:53] <%emperordread> the foot people would be super upset
[0:46:53] <+ThePiratePanda> @AngriestPat Should I be dumping my fractaline
[0:46:53] <derap41> Wouldn't everything but the top bun fall off?
[0:46:55] <ECRead> people do that now
[0:46:56] <chaospudding> @bigdumbidiotguy I agree
[0:46:58] <%rytisone> the last one
[0:47:00] <%0dokuro> Buns are now shoes
[0:47:01] <sonofthedeepsouth> Lul
[0:47:01] <TonberryLives> And somehow you people are not stoners LUL
[0:47:03] <mikesapartment> I'd have trouble not eating my feet
[0:47:04] <+DesertPenguin> Biologically are they hamburgers as in cooked meat or specifically beef?
[0:47:07] <kindashagg> they would move down to armpits
[0:47:07] <SomersaultJustice> you're basically playing dialect
[0:47:13] <oniwahoo> The fuck is Pat on about?
[0:47:14] <+dayz1003> feet all have the potential to be hamburgers
[0:47:15] <+DesertPenguin> How is the bun involved?
[0:47:16] <%ssjklyco> they would be defeeted
[0:47:16] <%RubberFistFight> @fabo_joyful terraria's fuckin great, more people need to push it at Pat, I think he'd enjoy it as long as he doesn't go in thinking "it's just 2D minecraft", since it SUPER isn't.
[0:47:24] <%joylent_blue> i mean yeah
[0:47:24] <+chunkymonkey737> describing obscure fetishes that probably exist
[0:47:25] <%peachy996> How is Soccer played with Burger feet?

[0:47:38] <%ElenaManetta> It's like how inside jokes aren't good when you write them into a script for comedy.
[0:47:38] <haidanort> @AngriestPat Does creating your own definition of success or failure in a game that doesn't define it for you count as a success/failure?
[0:47:40] <Marpolo13> idk why we are booing but BOOOOOOOOO

[0:48:20] <+MisterCrimson> @AngriestPat It's not about having a "win" condition so much as it's about having an objective to work towards. Dialect lacks this since it's a thought experiment on language.

[0:48:49] <+PaladinGuy1986> Okay Steve, nows your chance!!!
[0:48:53] <graemecrackers1> He rolled high
[0:48:54] <%bigdumbidiotguy> fuck u bastardman
[0:48:54] <+DesertPenguin> The best bard ever
[0:48:54] <%StaceMcGate> Actors are just professional liars
[0:48:55] <+Jokobeast> Seems like a really deep character. What's their motivation?
[0:48:55] <%Engwithan_Elder_God> It's not a lie if you believe it.
[0:48:55] <Reizie_Etherealm> It's a role for an asshole but yes you are correct
[0:48:58] <JonEWorldbeater> "Ihave a theory why people groan at certain jokes: jealousy."
[0:49:01] <+DesertPenguin> He's role playing as a bard
[0:49:01] <%ha2ken> Pat the Artist.
[0:49:03] <+DesertPenguin> lol
[0:49:03] <%joylent_blue> yeah, its not so much about winning as it is having something to work towards
[0:49:03] <%Roasted_Pheasant> But what was the point of roleplaying if you cant win
[0:49:04] <%WhereIsWill> what an artists
[0:49:06] <Marpolo13> "how do I win"
[0:49:07] <RyuuAoi> Pat is a BIG ROLE PLAYER
[0:49:11] <@ShockzNDrawe> do you mind losing though
[0:49:13] <+PaladinGuy1986> ACTING!!!
[0:49:15] <%StaceMcGate> How do you get 2nd place in a Jigsaw?
[0:49:16] <iosephe> You win by having fun
[0:49:16] <%peachy996> Depends on the Jigsaw
[0:49:17] <%bigdumbidiotguy> play Saw II on stream
[0:49:17] <Reizie_Etherealm> You don't win a jigsaw, you complete it
[0:49:20] <Brother_Coduss> @AngriestPat do you want to know the win condition of D&D? it's if at the end of the session everyone's had fun. that's the win condition
[0:49:23] <%peachy996> If you get Amanda you are fucked
[0:49:24] <RyuuAoi> Pat only plays if he can win
[0:49:25] <haidanort> honestly, the fact that you ARE such a shit makes you fun to watch
[0:49:25] <%GarbageNirvana> Have you ever played D&D with theater kids before? Now that's some roleplaying
[0:49:26] <%duskrush> A Jigsaw game where you cant win was actualy a plot point in that series
[0:49:28] <%UncleAWOL> Pat is the best role player. He always plays the role of the WINNER
[0:49:28] <%0dokuro> YUP
[0:49:28] <%AMajorTom> What if the only winning move is not to play?
[0:49:30] <%RubberFistFight> @AngriestPat play Terraria. It's got bosses, item upgrading, progression and a very clearly endgame goal.
[0:49:32] <graemecrackers1> The ending of Saw was great
[0:49:34] <%WhereIsWill> the "experience" is the win pat
[0:49:34] <$crown_clown22> what did you think of the new FF7R theme song?
[0:49:35] <Marpolo13> what edition is D&D on anyhow?
[0:49:36] <+DesertPenguin> sbfpSetIn
[0:49:36] <%Jekado> but i love 3rd ed
[0:49:36] <%natebud> All games have goals
[0:49:37] <%tiaramaki> Completing a puzzle counts as winning for me
[0:49:40] <%Jekado> I hate 4th
[0:49:40] <%peachy996> Amanda is a CHEATER
[0:49:40] <%TheMattman1313> Pat "Give me the instructions, Jigsaw" Boivin
[0:49:43] <%Jekado> I"M ONE OF THOSE
[0:49:43] <%vaporousTippler> 4 was way worse.
[0:49:48] <%peachy996> I love Amanda from Saw
[0:49:49] <%DeeTrz> dnd is on 5 right now
[0:49:51] <Goergorion> 3.5 is my favorate
[0:49:51] <%bigdumbidiotguy> is he talking about pokemon cards
[0:49:54] <arkv01> what kind of roleplay do you prefer in bed
[0:49:56] <Marpolo13> thx
[0:49:56] <%Ynkubus18> you missed 3.5
[0:49:56] <%Sora20030c> i played 4e and 5e, as well as Pathfinder
[0:49:57] <+DesertPenguin> apatBougie
[0:49:58] <%pectusumbra> That's 4
[0:49:59] <42nfl19> I think you mean 3.5/PF vs 3?
[0:50:01] <%Sora20030c> 4e is my least favorite version
[0:50:05] <%Sir_stride> and then 5th addition came out and everyone was happy
[0:50:05] <%Jekado> 3.75 is still my favorite
[0:50:05] <@ShockzNDrawe> People hate change Pat, welcome to new editions.
[0:50:06] <%emperordread> Bards are Rock n Role players
[0:50:06] <elspiceweasel> 4e is much more board gamey
[0:50:08] <%Mr_Pylon> 4e was just a math game
[0:50:10] <oniwahoo> I mean, that makes sense to me
[0:50:11] <%CopperTucker> I like a lot of things about 4e
[0:50:12] <%W1nterTitan> 4 was traaaaaash
[0:50:13] <%GeneralSCPatton> 4TH IS A GRID-BASED TBS
[0:50:14] <graemecrackers1> Warhammer
[0:50:15] <derap41> Rolling intimidation is a thing
[0:50:15] <%damienlunas> Pat you would LOVE 4e
[0:50:16] <%0dokuro> 3rd edition added cool stuff, 4th was watered down pathfinder
[0:50:18] <chaospudding> 5th is great though
[0:50:21] <Yrefe> oh pat would love 4e
[0:50:23] <%Dhrall> 4 had monthly patch notes
[0:50:26] <%marsantas> 4 was so bad 5th got rushed out
[0:50:26] <%pectusumbra> 4 went a lot more like an MMO or video game translated into tabletop
[0:50:28] <%Swampykins> It's not
[0:50:29] <%unclekulikov> I've got the set of 4th edition books on me shelf
[0:50:30] <%MajorCrasher> LUL
[0:50:30] <cureneckbeard> it's not
[0:50:30] <Marpolo13> xcom?
[0:50:33] <%SilverFaustX> ff tactics?
[0:50:34] <derap41> Advanced is still best
[0:50:35] <%MoulesFritz> it's not
[0:50:35] <42nfl19> THEN YOU MIGHT LIKE PF2e
[0:50:35] <%Gogogolem> 4th edition is literally the most hated edition of d&d ever
[0:50:36] <Stillchr> Everyone was a wizard in 4
[0:50:36] <%unclekulikov> You should check 4th out :)
[0:50:36] <timblenaut> 4e also nearly killed the franchise
[0:50:37] <%Mekhet09> It has issues.
[0:50:38] <haidanort> i feel bad, i never played d&d but i wish i did
[0:50:38] <$FriedMattato> 4E sucks
[0:50:40] <%asgard147> Xcom? limesThink
[0:50:40] <Brother_Coduss> @AngriestPat the win condition of D&D is that everyone has fun at the end of the night
[0:50:41] <%Ynkubus18> all of them are optionally grid based
[0:50:41] <%Criox1388> Oh RE4? Lets goooo!
[0:50:43] <%MoulesFritz> AD&D is STILL best
[0:50:43] <%Arxel1> Heck all characters in 4E had a list of SPECIAL MOVES. Like fucking FFT
[0:50:44] <cureneckbeard> 4th edition is like D&D if D&D took two hours to play one combat
[0:50:45] <%bigdumbidiotguy> what about Cones of Dunshire @angriestpat
[0:50:47] <Yrefe> it's heavy on rules and grid tactics
[0:50:48] <%Garthunox> just play 5th
[0:50:48] <+TheSaintJohn> Pat deciding to like things out of spite is peak Pat
[0:50:49] <jyrecko> FIRE EMBLEM?
[0:50:49] <@ShockzNDrawe> when will people just accept D&D isn't for Pat and just leave it at that
[0:50:51] <%oddslogic> 2E for life
[0:50:52] <elspiceweasel> i learned to play in 4e, so i love it, but 5e is great
[0:50:54] <%Dragon_Batman> Yup

[0:51:15] <oniwahoo> @shockzndrawe How can Pat not like the things I like tho?!
[0:51:18] <+arancet> @AngriestPat pat, i guess you can think of DIalect like Until Dawn, its a story you define with no win/lose, if your goal is to save the kids, thats your own self defined story goal
[0:51:21] <RyuuAoi> @sommenrider He did...
[0:51:21] <%tiaramaki> That can't be worth the pesetas tho

[0:51:34] <+ExpressNode> In Japan?

[0:52:17] <%ScreamLord> I got it like a year ago
[0:52:17] <%theKingRamses> rip
[0:52:18] <arkv01> the PSN release date is wrong
[0:52:18] <%Dragon_Batman> Yea that's about right LUL
[0:52:19] <42nfl19> AND THEY NEVER DID
[0:52:19] <%Rumbutt> oof
[0:52:20] <%Solidnick18> got it
[0:52:20] <oniwahoo> and they never did
[0:52:24] <%Mekhet09> I still think it's the worst one so far. P5's story is pretty fucking meandering and terrible.
[0:52:25] <derap41> Those people are not nice they're roleplaying
[0:52:26] <%bigdumbidiotguy> that's why they had to take Elmo tonthe vet. he ate a chocolate weed
[0:52:26] <%JohnAtDawn> JUST STREAM IT YOU COWARD
[0:52:26] <%BallerSwagBro9k> @angriestpat Will you stream Ori 2 in two weeks
[0:52:27] <giogio346> just stream it. no one cares
[0:52:33] <%asgard147> REALLY? STILL with this shit?!
[0:52:33] <%MajorCrasher> just stream it, Atlus never did anything to anyone else who streamed it
[0:52:36] <%Ranryu692> I started P5 the same day I finished P4G. That was a mistake. P5 was such a disappointment when compared directly to P4's writing
[0:52:37] <arkv01> sure why the hell not, stream the shit outta it
[0:52:39] <TonberryLives> ENB streamed P5 like a shit load of times right?
[0:52:40] <%Tracazoid> Poor PR guys, gotta put up with shit just like "characters are just functions."
[0:52:42] <%marsantas> They'll get back to you with a no
[0:52:44] <graemecrackers1> A chocolate weed !
[0:52:45] <Yummy_Nukes> @angriestpat you can also destroy the boulder with the infinite tommy gun too

[0:53:02] <+dayz1003> Yay!
[0:53:03] <arkv01> PORNHUB HAS STREAMING PogChamp
[0:53:03] <%uncletwistyfresh> I didn't like P4G's writing
[0:53:03] <%roundii> Study and give so much money
[0:53:04] <@ShockzNDrawe> People yell at me for liking P4 the most because it's "The Bad One"
[0:53:13] <Merkensteiner> I despise studying
[0:53:13] <%RubberFistFight> Any game company who responds to "can I give you literal free advertising that you don't need to pay me anything for" with anything other than "YES", isn't really a company worth paying attention to the opinions of.
[0:53:16] <deviljhojho_> i oh thank god
[0:53:17] <%ElenaManetta> calls him out
[0:53:22] <%Mekhet09> @Ranryu692 yeah the writing seems to be 2>3>4=1>5
[0:53:24] <deviljhojho_> i tought he was gonna call me out
[0:53:29] <Reizie_Etherealm> @deviljhojho_ LUL

[0:53:38] <+anarachnid> Yes will be hard
[0:53:39] <Finakala> @ShockzNDrawe P4 is the best one though
[0:53:44] <%bigdumbidiotguy> @angriestpat dance monky
[0:53:48] <%CopperTucker> P4 is super good
[0:53:48] <deviljhojho_> @Reizie_Etherealm crikCool
[0:53:51] <RyuuAoi> Pat will get SHUT THE FUCK DOWN
[0:53:51] <@ShockzNDrawe> Not according to some people
[0:53:52] <deviljhojho_> oh yeah, rip
[0:54:04] <JackalKing> I remember that. TotalBiscuit boycotted them for years for that
[0:54:06] <%ssjklyco> You don't want to be the one they decide to actually look at
[0:54:07] <%theKingRamses> tb had a huge hateboner against them for that
[0:54:09] <%rytisone> Sega is aiming at Pat's forehead
[0:54:11] <%JohnAtDawn> Wich they did not enforce
[0:54:11] <%oddslogic> I miss shining force so much
[0:54:14] <%albedo455> 7/7
[0:54:14] <deviljhojho_> that treath fucked us over
[0:54:15] <%SilverFaustX> yakuza monkaS
[0:54:23] <+dayz1003> remember how the SBFP lp of p5 got shut down? just saying
[0:54:24] <oniwahoo> Not Worth?
[0:54:24] <%moogleboy1984> remake of Shining Force 3 when?
[0:54:25] <+ExpressNode> I actually like P5 the least. I favor P4G and P3 FES way better
[0:54:25] <%joylent_blue> god what a shitty business decision
[0:54:26] <%Dragon_Batman> It's not a risk worth taking honestly
[0:54:29] <%Roundelay11> it's just better to not take the risk
[0:54:30] <%GeneralSCPatton> FUCK US? FUCK THEM!
[0:54:32] <ThatOneGuyYouSaw> @angriestpat do it you coward
[0:54:33] <%RubberFistFight> I hate that they're allowed to do that via abuse of the ridiculous DMCA system the US helped build, considering they don't have the legal authority to do that.
[0:54:35] <%BallerSwagBro9k> RARA FIGHT THE POWA PAT
[0:54:36] <%marsantas> Most other games don't have a gun to your head
[0:54:36] <%sporeian94> Which is worse ATLUS's opinions on streaming their games or the fact they announce their games on random 4AM streams
[0:54:36] <TonberryLives> This is true
[0:54:37] <damascussteele> Ok proffessor
[0:54:37] <%JohnAtDawn> Yeah watch what happens if they tried that shit with Twitch. with AMAZON
[0:54:38] <graemecrackers1> Good move pat
[0:54:40] <deviljhojho_> ITS FEBRUARY
[0:54:41] <RyuuAoi> Just do P1 and P2 part 1 and 2 @angriestpat
[0:54:42] <derap41> Companies love fucking Pat
[0:54:42] <%Ranryu692> P5 wouldn't be a great LP anyway
[0:54:42] <timblenaut> Pat "Risk Averse" Boivin
[0:54:45] <+dayz1003> You got Yakuza HD coming Out next month!
[0:54:45] <Finakala> Reminder that Persona 4 Arena was the ONLY GAME on PS3 that was region locked
[0:54:46] <%pectusumbra> That's the simple truth of it. There's more games than a person can play
[0:54:47] <@ShockzNDrawe> OH SHIT FUCK YOU ITS JANUARY IS ALMOST OVER
[0:54:48] <%Tucker0603> to be honest, that statement by atlas makes me NEVER wanna play P5 I just like the music
[0:54:49] <%emperordread> It would also take like 30 sessions to finish
[0:54:51] <Reizie_Etherealm> If it goes well we can get good content if it doesn't nothing of value will be lost, it's a win win for us Kappa
[0:54:52] <%bigdumbidiotguy> @angriestpat just play the dang game monky boy dance for the chat
[0:54:54] <someyounguy1> atlus comin at you like its berserk
[0:54:56] <cureneckbeard> fuck you it's february
[0:54:56] <Marpolo13> it's a "why take the completely unnecessary risk" scenario
[0:54:57] <%Corporate_Redeemer> Will there at least be a spoilercast for PR5?
[0:54:57] <%Takreth> what happened to fire emblem stream
[0:54:57] <graemecrackers1> Weed infused tea is odd
[0:54:58] <elspiceweasel> FUCK YOU JANUARY'S OVER

[0:55:06] <nigawatts1988> Pat I will send you my PSTV
[0:55:07] <%Ranryu692> I just bought a Vita TV this week to play Golden. It's arriving tomorrow!

[0:55:09] <%genowyn> Get a pstv they are like $30
[0:55:09] <+ExpressNode> Do you have a PS TV?
[0:55:12] <%cvp5127> just use retroarch
[0:55:14] <%MoulesFritz> golden STILL being on the Vita only is NUTS
[0:55:15] <%Th3SmartAlec> LUL
[0:55:15] <%peachy996> Play Golden as you smoke weed without a shirt on
[0:55:15] <%joylent_blue> Takreth last he said was he'd wait for the dlc
[0:55:17] <TonberryLives> wat

[0:55:19] <deviljhojho_> Fuck the ocean
[0:55:23] <%the1truefaraldo> I bought a vita for golden
[0:55:23] <oniwahoo> That is pretty amusing
[0:55:23] <%sporeian94> Ocean Man!
[0:55:25] <arkv01> forget companies, your boypussy is ours
[0:55:26] <Reizie_Etherealm> OCEAN MAN
[0:55:27] <%Roasted_Pheasant> Why does Moana's dad hate her?
[0:55:29] <+nekodelic> fuck my daughter
[0:55:31] <%natebud> Wait moana means ocean? says her dad
[0:55:32] <%Takreth> @joylent_blue sweet must have missed that, thanks!
[0:55:33] <%MoulesFritz> how much money did atlus give up on by keeping Golden Vita-only
[0:55:38] <%MoulesFritz> it's insane
[0:55:40] <%bluebiscuit94> Just mean he hates his daughter too
[0:55:41] <%Mekhet09> @AngriestPat you can just get a pstv?
[0:55:45] <alwayspronking> LUL OCEAN MAN
[0:55:50] <Marpolo13> yes
[0:55:51] <arkv01> play golden you coward
[0:55:53] <%natebud> no
[0:55:54] <Meekest> Triton is a super old actual greek name
[0:55:56] <Finakala> Vita is worth it for P4G and Muramasa Rebirth alone, especially at current prices
[0:55:57] <dukenux> Have he not even started playing. is he still on gummi bears?
[0:55:58] <%Gogogolem> The tridents named after him
[0:55:58] <alwayspronking> probably just a title
[0:55:59] <cureneckbeard> maybe the trident is named after him
[0:55:59] <deviljhojho_> the trident was named after him totally tomatoSmile
[0:56:00] <oniwahoo> Isn't Triton a god?
[0:56:00] <someyounguy1> thats like vincent from ff7 being name GUN
[0:56:01] <%MajorCrasher> just get a pstv, they're cheap and easy to use
[0:56:01] <%patriotrenegade> Triton is actual marine organism @AngriestPat
[0:56:04] <%Psyramics> that's the name one of Poseidon's kids
[0:56:06] <%duskrush> Who names their kid MALEFICENT if they don't want them to be evil
[0:56:06] <elspiceweasel> they named tridents after him
[0:56:06] <chaospudding> He was the 3rd generation, his father was named Bident
[0:56:06] <%marsantas> No Triton is actually an old demi-god
[0:56:07] <%legendscar01> lets get to the game
[0:56:08] <%bigdumbidiotguy> King Triton has a cock shaped house
[0:56:08] <JonEWorldbeater> Or her mum named her
[0:56:09] <%joylent_blue> TRITON KNEW ABOUT THE KEYBLADES
[0:56:09] <%Engwithan_Elder_God> Isn't it part of being king?
[0:56:09] <haidanort> triton is a son of poseidon in greek mythology
[0:56:12] <nigawatts1988> It feels like Atlus only character about Japan sales, and everything else is just extra.
[0:56:13] <$Timesteel> Raidou is sick
[0:56:16] <%pectusumbra> I want another devil survivor
[0:56:16] <RyuuAoi> Pat, I need to do my taxes. I need you to stop streaming. I need to adult.
[0:56:17] <%sporeian94> People shit on Ariel for leaving her people and making and evil deal with a witch to get some dick, but other than Flounder and Sebastian there's no other men in Antlantis
[0:56:18] <nigawatts1988> cares8
[0:56:18] <Brother_Coduss> @AngriestPat no, he was named after poseidon's son Triton
[0:56:19] <%moogleboy1984> but the names of those games are impossible
[0:56:25] <%barkon345> @haidanort shoot enemies in the head when you see them stagger run up and kick them knocking them to the ground. after they fall knife them to death, it will save you a tone of ammo
[0:56:26] <deviljhojho_> kuzonoha vs woolie
[0:56:27] <%BlueMoonBlues> So great that Woolie stole it
[0:56:33] <%RubberFistFight> @bigdumbidiotguy reckon he's got a house-shaped cock?
[0:56:34] <Huntercd> Yea it was
[0:56:34] <+ExpressNode> We need Digital Devil Saga games too. Locked on my PS2 forever
[0:56:36] <%trekkie11041> id like a new digital devil saga
[0:56:41] <%patriotrenegade> @AngriestPat A "Triton" is a real organism that lives in the ocean
[0:56:42] <%JohnAtDawn> PANEL?
[0:56:44] <haidanort> @barkon345 thanks
[0:56:45] <%genowyn> Well King Abaddon is great, Soulless Army sorta sucks
[0:56:54] <%Mekhet09> digital devil saga got a rerelease on PS3 but not 4.
[0:56:54] <%Teh_Un> apatDab apatDab apatDab
[0:56:55] <deviljhojho_> bro u gonna go or what
[0:56:56] <Man_in_the_Red> say what you will about SMT versus Persona, SMT at least has a higher ratio of good games Kappa
[0:56:57] <oniwahoo> Gotta be sure
[0:56:58] <%Corporate_Redeemer> @haidanort Always aim for the knees or faces unless dealing with special enemies so that way you can melee them. Melee makes you temporarily invincible when prompted so don't be afraid to kneecap or headshot someone, run into a group, and melee them. Also, always prioritize buying inventory space upgrades.
[0:56:59] <%moogleboy1984> Raidou Kuzunoha vs the Soulless Army and Raidou Kuzunoha vs King Abaddon
[0:57:03] <%bigdumbidiotguy> Make sure you show up for Monkycon
[0:57:03] <%emperordread> Fuck you it's January

[0:58:55] <%patriotrenegade> @AngriestPat The guy who invented the spelling of "February" also invented the spelling of "Wednesday"
[0:58:56] <+chunkymonkey737> why do you put such a strong emphasis on the vargBruh
[0:58:59] <Rawklobstah88> Because GOD tanks play awful in FFXIV, but I don't want to play WoW

[0:59:06] <%barkon345> I thought it was Fuck you its January

[0:59:26] <giogio346> it's just too much with all the re-releases LUL
[0:59:27] <%joylent_blue> i bought kiwami 2 and never booted it up
[0:59:30] <%ha2ken> If you're born on a Leap Year, you age more slowly than other people. Kappa
[0:59:34] <%blackbaron98> judgment was cool
[0:59:34] <%peachy996> Did you ever finish Kiwami 1 on stream!? I dont remember

[0:59:39] <%Ranryu692> @AngriestPat Kiwami 2 will be great for the next time we are in between big releases
[0:59:40] <+ExpressNode> @MoralCompassGaming I think its just every 4 years

[1:07:21] <%LunarRemix> PUT THE TWO HERBS ON TOP OF EACH OTHER
[1:07:21] <HealingMind> I never played this game, so I never knew it was an inventory management simulator.
[1:07:22] <%rasterman> gotta switch the shotgun shells so the full one is on top
[1:07:23] <+luketrapwalker> That was sooooo satisfying
[1:07:23] <%MelBrooksKA> You think Ashley is getting really worried seeing Leon compulsively reorganizing his atache case
[1:07:25] <%Sir_stride> YUP
[1:07:26] <%Arazien> He really is crazy, huh?
[1:07:27] <%blastazoid26> Just end the stream. This is all we need to see
[1:07:27] <PunishedMercer_> i don't care if you don't have ocd, this is a win.

[1:07:39] <%natebud> 4x2 + 3X1
[1:07:39] <$lotharrio> The stock isn't the same dimension.

[1:07:40] <%legendscar01> @AngriestPat 8 for red9 and 3 fore stock

[1:07:41] <%ScreamLord> apatCrazyhand apatCrazyhead apatWrong

[1:07:47] <+dayz1003> YES.
[1:07:47] <%Sir_stride> yes
[1:07:48] <Reizie_Etherealm> Put the stock in the back of the TMP
[1:07:48] <cureneckbeard> STOCC
[1:07:48] <%stevesekai> PUT HERBS ON TOP OF EAACHOTHER SO AMMO IS NEXT TO EACHOTHER
[1:07:49] <%asgard147> limesS
[1:07:49] <%ultimatetotoro> perfectly organized
[1:07:50] <MikeNized> My personal opinion : incendiary grenades blow.
[1:07:50] <%aishman> Ye
[1:07:51] <%nofestu2> apatGoblin apatGoblin apatGoblin
[1:07:52] <iamnotaparrot> stock is 1X3
[1:07:53] <Roz_Lynd> the red9 is 2x4
[1:07:54] <%ogtrashwizard> @angriestpat hey switch the green ammo
[1:07:54] <studleydoorite> no in a circle
[1:07:55] <MikeNized> So, y'know, toss them around.
[1:07:56] <+crook_fuji> I respect it but I fear for the homie.
[1:07:56] <%BallerSwagBro9k> apatGoblin apatGoblin apatGoblin apatGoblin apatGoblin
[1:07:57] <%tiaramaki> Switch stock so it's at left of the TMP
[1:07:57] <chaospudding> worry about this when you get the red 9
[1:07:57] <%aishman> USE THAT AMMO
[1:07:58] <%joylent_blue> just use some grenades i guess
[1:07:59] <%Sir_stride> it will be
[1:08:01] <RyuuAoi> They are high, Pat
[1:08:03] <%natebud> You'll be able to see stuff it's fine
[1:08:04] <cureneckbeard> buy a bigger box
[1:08:05] <%XeroSigmaPrime> Froget it
[1:08:07] <ThatOneGuyYouSaw> DEAL WITH IT LATER
[1:08:08] <%DensityD> ONE GUY
[1:08:08] <%patriotrenegade> pat pls rotate the stock upright
[1:08:08] <+IShadowStrykerI> swap the stock and tmp plz
[1:08:08] <morcego_cinzento_arts> red9 has the same size as a magnum in the case(8 squares)
[1:08:09] <%WhereIsWill> I feel like people actually had orgasms to that WutFace
[1:08:09] <JonEWorldbeater> But you have higher numbers above lower and vice versa
[1:08:10] <%sporeian94> red9 is 2x4
[1:08:10] <42nfl19> PAT SWITCH THE TMP STOCK
[1:08:11] <%cdrom321> Red9 is 2X8.
[1:08:12] <%aishman> You'll see it when you get there
[1:08:12] <Fujiwara_92> 8 and 3 Pat
[1:08:12] <%traytr> tmp stock is where it's at for quick weapon switching
[1:08:13] <chhdez> We all should learn to use our mind goblins for actual good
[1:08:13] <Ran196> you'll do fine Pat
[1:08:14] <Reizie_Etherealm> Just make sure you use up some resources by then
[1:08:14] <Yummy_Nukes> @angriestpat THE TMP AND IT'S STOCK IS TRIGGERING MY OCD
[1:08:14] <%bigdumbidiotguy> just shit on your own ass
[1:08:14] <%SolverCODO> pat is breaking stock law
[1:08:15] <Marpolo13> cross that bridge when you get there
[1:08:17] <%rytisone> I never bother with arranging consumables, just guns
[1:08:18] <+C24U> Missed barrel
[1:08:19] <%theotherkristian> Just Throw A Grenade
[1:08:20] <Marpolo13> FUTURE Pat problems
[1:08:20] <%Agami23> pat, when you get to it. you'll get to it
[1:08:23] <%tiaramaki> Ohhh
[1:08:23] <%Monkeyweed21> missed a barrel
[1:08:25] <akumakaizokun> Red 9 is 4x2
[1:08:26] <$lotharrio> Pat why didn't you put your ammo next to the gun?
[1:08:28] <%galaxyswirl> i love how the backwards stock doesnt bother pat
[1:08:31] <Strider222> missed the barrel
[1:08:31] <%Sir_stride> ooooooooooh
[1:08:32] <Peculiar_Pangolin> But it looks bad
[1:08:34] <RyuuAoi> @theotherkristian Bosses only
[1:08:37] <Reizie_Etherealm> I see
[1:08:38] <%stevesekai> SWITCH HERB WITH HANDGUN AMMO
[1:08:39] <42nfl19> i see
[1:08:41] <+HelloImTom08> TMP run PogChamp
[1:08:41] <%Aydarkzero> nah
[1:08:41] <%legendscar01> @AngriestPat Don't forget the bird nests
[1:08:42] <%ogtrashwizard> PAT YOU BASTARD SWITCH THE GREEN AMMO SO THE BIG NUMBER IS ON TOP
[1:08:44] <+Scevda> Just like your TV
[1:08:47] <%joylent_blue> but its not optimal for our eyes
[1:08:47] <%Aydarkzero> you leave the stock on the corner
[1:08:48] <%radda343> BUT MY GOBLINS THO
[1:08:48] <TheHeroAppears> it's wrong though
[1:08:51] <%PlainSimpleTailor> Speed Run Strats
[1:08:52] <%bigdumbidiotguy> spooky dogs monkaS
[1:08:57] <vernardohunk93> you should turn the stock 180 so it has a closed ending
[1:08:59] <grimm_hatter> kill priest in church
[1:09:03] <nademonkey1100> ohhh that inventory makes me soo happy
[1:09:06] <grimm_hatter> 5000 each
[1:09:10] <Rawklobstah88> You ever think that this obsessvie behavior is how speedrunners get their start?
[1:09:10] <+IShadowStrykerI> but look at it tho pat, its not right...
[1:09:11] <%patriotrenegade> HWAAH
[1:09:17] <%Reaverund> Did my first pro run of this last year. It's so much fun
[1:09:18] <%GeneralSCPatton> Store the TMP and stock upside down so you can quick-select and have them aligned
[1:09:18] <ohgodscorpions> no but hitting equip on the stock equips the tmp im for cereal
[1:09:19] <%PlainSimpleTailor> morir es vivir, verdad, vato?
[1:09:19] <%theotherkristian> @ryuuaoi I throw grenades into the air in RE2 when I needed space
[1:09:22] <Goergorion> The kick, more powerful then the bullet
[1:09:23] <%peachy996> Is RE4 the only Escort Character done right?
[1:09:29] <%patriotrenegade> @AngriestPat Did you try and look up Ashley's skirt last session
[1:09:30] <%ultimatetotoro> sure is nice to catch w stream for once
[1:09:31] <%Shadicara> This is RE 0 now you have two people Kappa
[1:09:33] <Ran196> shoot the bell for more zombies
[1:09:36] <+Scevda> ICO?
[1:09:37] <Peculiar_Pangolin> ICO
[1:09:38] <chaospudding> What about ICO
[1:09:39] <+magnumb> MGS2 escort mission was not bad
[1:09:39] <Judeknight> What about Ico?
[1:09:40] <omen_setter> in RE, you try not to use ammo so you can get more ammo
[1:09:40] <Marpolo13> but RE5 though Kappa
[1:09:41] <%peachy996> Amazing
[1:09:42] <Roz_Lynd> HAAAAALP LEOOOOOON
[1:09:43] <%ElenaManetta> Ico?
[1:09:44] <%sporeian94> Maybe Bioshock Infinite...
[1:09:44] <%rytisone> that sweater is gonna get wet real soon
[1:09:46] <+chunkymonkey737> don't forget about Final Fight Streetwise Kappa
[1:09:46] <Man_in_the_Red> @magnumb LUL
[1:09:47] <+dayz1003> Bioshock Infinite is a good escort because Elizabeth takes care of herself.
[1:09:47] <derap41> ICO was super annoying
[1:09:47] <haidanort> what about maria in silent hill 2
[1:09:49] <$lotharrio> Being able to shove her in a dumpster is vital.
[1:09:51] <Mister_McDerp> LEEOOON
[1:09:53] <%radda343> Bioshock Infinite tho
[1:09:55] <$RetroCop87> @AngriestPat my pizza delivery arrived 2 hours late and was cold, the italian side spilled in the box, and the delivery guy was pissed when I refused to tip. You're playing RE4 is making up for 80% of that, thanks!
[1:09:57] <%natebud> SH4 is alright, because she can't be killed
[1:09:58] <%anticrust> NICE
[1:09:59] <theobble> I recently rewatched funtime adventures FeelsBadMan
[1:10:00] <timblenaut> nakkiLewd
[1:10:00] <42nfl19> PARRY THIS
[1:10:01] <%Dragon_Batman> Yea Maybe Bioshock Infinite, where she helps you
[1:10:02] <%GeneralSCPatton> Nice
[1:10:02] <%Sausious> bitch, dumpster
[1:10:04] <Man_in_the_Red> Bioshock Infinite doesnt count, Elizabeth is escorting you
[1:10:05] <+Shockrates20XX> Elizabeth isn't an escort, she's a companion. YOu don't have to protect her.
[1:10:05] <Peculiar_Pangolin> @dayz1003 That makes it bad though since she has zero impact on gameplay
[1:10:06] <%patriotrenegade> LEOOON HAAALP
[1:10:06] <+C24U> What about Revelations 2?
[1:10:08] <%joylent_blue> Elizabeth can't die though chat
[1:10:10] <%Gogogolem> Its cause you have the bitch button that makes her so great.
[1:10:10] <%ElenaManetta> Yoshi's Island TECHNICALLY
[1:10:11] <%MalekDracarus> No it‚Äôs god of war
[1:10:11] <+nekodelic> Ico is nice
[1:10:12] <%legendscar01> @AngriestPat shoot the bird nest in front of the church
[1:10:13] <%tiaramaki> I never knew you could come back there
[1:10:13] <%PauliusMaximus> ellie in the last of us isnt a problem
[1:10:14] <%bigdumbidiotguy> never knew those guys were there
[1:10:15] <Finakala> Ellie in TLoU technically?
[1:10:17] <RyuuAoi> Man...FUCK THE TMP
[1:10:18] <President_valentine> where she belongs
[1:10:18] <%Agami23> bioshock infinite isnt a escort quest, sshe is a invincible power up
[1:10:18] <+Scevda> Just like gf IRL
[1:10:19] <%ZComiX> PUMPS HER FIST
[1:10:20] <%CollinsOfBodom> where she belongs
[1:10:20] <%sporeian94> What's the worst escort game?
[1:10:24] <grimm_hatter> where she belongs
[1:10:25] <%Monkeyweed21> Pat you missed a barrel
[1:10:27] <%majima666> get in the dumpster presidents daughter
[1:10:29] <%duskrush> He said that can take damage
[1:10:29] <$lotharrio> The nests respawn.
[1:10:31] <+Jokobeast> I don't think Ellie can take damage, though.
[1:10:32] <%AncelDeLambert> she go in garbage cuz she trash
[1:10:33] <Judeknight> Ico?
[1:10:34] <morcego_cinzento_arts> @RetroCop87 Man fuck that delivery guy
[1:10:35] <%Mr_Strut> Journey
[1:10:36] <%sporeian94> Yeah but there's gotta be one
[1:10:36] <%Dragon_Batman> Hah yea God of War 2018, the child protects you
[1:10:36] <%duskrush> Ellie and Elizabeth can't really take damage
[1:10:37] <+Shockrates20XX> Same with Ellie. Not an escort. Doesn't need protection.
[1:10:37] <%patriotrenegade> I prefer escort characters who are invincible
[1:10:38] <%natebud> bioshock is the worst
[1:10:40] <%peachy996> And if you really suck babysitting her, throw her in the armor
[1:10:40] <%sporeian94> one that's infinitely the worst
[1:10:41] <%Monkeyweed21> MISSED BARREL
[1:10:43] <+Hitorio> How often does the escorted character BECOME the badass? :D
[1:10:43] <+RowenCleric> silent hill 4
[1:10:43] <%AncelDeLambert> she smell like garba
[1:10:44] <%Sir_stride> almost all the boxes respawn
[1:10:45] <%supersugoisenpai1> Ashley, more like Trashley
[1:10:45] <JonEWorldbeater> Amy
[1:10:47] <%ZComiX> SHE PUPS HER FIST WHEN YOU DO GOOD!!
[1:10:48] <cheezbass> worst escort is final fight streetwise
[1:10:48] <austinj24> Dragons Dogma has some ok escorts
[1:10:49] <%legendscar01> @AngriestPat Everything reset
[1:10:50] <%Sora20030c> God everytime I see RE4 I cant help but think of how good of a game it is
[1:10:50] <$lotharrio> MGS2 has a pretty bad escort mission. Where it's underwater and timed.
[1:10:53] <+dayz1003> @patriotrenegade like Elizabeth in bioshock infinite
[1:10:55] <%worldbrand> any game where the escortee body blocks you
[1:10:55] <%rytisone> this game is tight
[1:10:55] <ohgodscorpions> all the birds nests respawn when you hit night time
[1:10:56] <%Dragovus> @AngriestPat You know you loved Final Fight Streetwise
[1:10:59] <TomFrank> dead rising
[1:11:01] <%nofestu2> wowowowow
[1:11:02] <Meekest> Ashley also catches up quickly when you call her back
[1:11:02] <Finakala> Worst escort is that one douche from the original Halo for that one mission since he walked right into my shot once and died
[1:11:02] <%natebud> wawa weewo
[1:11:02] <%Solidnick18> good enough
[1:11:03] <Reizie_Etherealm> Yeeeaaah
[1:11:07] <%AncelDeLambert> no-one tell him
[1:11:11] <+MisterCrimson> ...the ammo called "Jackal" has a wolf on the box
[1:11:13] <+nekodelic> @austinj24 I respectfully disagree, and I love that game
[1:11:13] <%joylent_blue> oh god Final Fight Streetwise
[1:11:13] <TomFrank> the escort is bad though
[1:11:13] <Peculiar_Pangolin> Dead Rising 1 is amazing
[1:11:14] <$lotharrio> Control has bad (optional) escort missions, where they die near instantly.
[1:11:17] <%WhereIsWill> what about bioshock infinite tho
[1:11:20] <+C24U> Never seen you play it
[1:11:20] <derap41> 2 was also good
[1:11:23] <%Aydarkzero> only played dead rising 2
[1:11:25] <%Zebroneath> Dead Rising is an amazing series of 2 games
[1:11:25] <%ElkRiverDog> Ico is a good second place thoy
[1:11:26] <%majima666> as much as i cream over mgs2, its pretty hard to deny that escort mission is god damn terrible
[1:11:28] <$RetroCop87> Would dead rising have been better as a spinoff of RE?
[1:11:28] <%optimasmaximas> @MisterCrimson shhhh
[1:11:29] <%galaxyswirl> why not stream dead rising pat?
[1:11:29] <%legendscar01> @AngriestPat There's one behind you

[1:12:14] <%DensityD> Ashley asks: "Leon, who are you talking to?"
[1:12:16] <%Dementedpenguin> The only thing I remember about the Wii port is how hard people were defending it on message boards
[1:12:17] <Ran196> sell it
[1:12:17] <morcego_cinzento_arts> @AngriestPat Ever saw a video of a comparison between Dead Rising 4 and 1 gameplays? It's funny and sad how the series devolved

[1:12:31] <%patriotrenegade> Ahhhh, I'll buy it a hoigh price
[1:12:31] <$RetroCop87> I kind of wish the merchant had lore
[1:12:32] <MikeNized> That's the Wii Port.
[1:12:33] <%Solidnick18> Thank you
[1:12:35] <%peachy996> Everyone loves to do the merchant voice
[1:12:37] <MikeNized> And, honestly, it's unique.
[1:12:37] <+Jokobeast> Trader's such a cheery guy.
[1:12:41] <+RealPT1> I was real close to getting Chop till you drop because I didn't have a 360
[1:12:41] <MikeNized> But it's not Dead Rising.
[1:12:44] <%rytisone> never used it
[1:12:45] <+dayz1003> why not sell the punisher for free money?
[1:12:45] <%Shadicara> Goodbye tmp

[1:13:37] <%AncelDeLambert> I think you did it once
[1:13:37] <%DensityD> apatCrazy
[1:13:37] <%legendscar01> @AngriestPat Are you keeping this rifle or semi-auto
[1:13:38] <%Order_of_Mystery> @AngriestPat can we see that sick reload animation?
[1:13:39] <$lotharrio> Pat your attache case is a mess.
[1:13:39] <%JohnAtDawn> So you've never played the Wii version, THE SUPERIOR VERSION?
[1:13:40] <+nekodelic> That one empty square tho
[1:13:41] <+RowenCleric> is the merchant the best RE character of all time?
[1:13:46] <%AncelDeLambert> become ERECT
[1:13:51] <%silverira> WHAT YOU THUNK OF IT
[1:13:52] <%ssjklyco> You used it in the old LP
[1:13:53] <RyuuAoi> Why would you?
[1:13:54] <%asgard147> Kreygasm
[1:13:55] <%Sir_stride> UMF
[1:13:56] <%Flambage> @AngriestPat Organize your case!
[1:13:56] <%Order_of_Mystery> UNF
[1:13:57] <derap41> USING CLIPS!

[1:14:02] <Mister_McDerp> stripper clips are cool
[1:14:03] <%patriotrenegade> Cram MORE bullets in their
[1:14:03] <%sporeian94> PAT THE LATERN
[1:14:06] <%InugamiTheHound> sniper rifle reload?
[1:14:07] <%AncelDeLambert> Pat at maximum chub
[1:14:10] <$lotharrio> Better.

[1:14:10] <%radda343> delicious stripper clips
[1:14:11] <%mh9s> strip my clip
[1:14:12] <%DensityD> lanter?
[1:14:12] <Nina96> nice
[1:14:13] <haidanort> yo @AngriestPat apparently leon and the merchant have the same voice actor
[1:14:15] <%legendscar01> Nothing in this latern
[1:14:15] <Marpolo13> Kreygasm organization
[1:14:16] <cureneckbeard> phew.
[1:14:16] <Fujiwara_92> Kreygasm
[1:14:17] <%cvp5127> not optimal
[1:14:18] <%JJCheeker> I just got cum everywhere thanks a lot Pat
[1:14:26] <%rytisone> maybe I should replay this game for 8th time and finally use red9
[1:14:29] <chaospudding> Put one thing of ammo where the left health spray is
[1:14:35] <gekizenbu> i cant believe pat would waste a consumeable for a reload animation
[1:14:35] <%legendscar01> There's is a spinel in that one
[1:14:36] <+Selectamo> THe colors of the ammo COULD match the grenade colors
[1:14:37] <Ran196> isn't there more spinnels if you shoot it out again?
[1:14:38] <%Meidolaon> He get the roof treasure in the cave?
[1:14:38] <xxshadowxx416> so no rpg
[1:14:39] <%joylent_blue> my favorite bit is still Pat intentionally fucking up the attache case in the RE4 LP
[1:14:41] <morcego_cinzento_arts> I cannot wait for the final upgrade for the Red9 that basically turns it into an nerfed magnum
[1:14:42] <+chunkymonkey737> vargNut vargNut
[1:14:51] <%Dragon_Batman> Yea he got the roof treasure last stream
[1:14:56] <%legendscar01> @AngriestPat There's is a spinel in that one
[1:14:58] <%AncelDeLambert> goodbye, end of game
[1:15:07] <%ssjklyco> warble
[1:15:12] <%MayShip> when's the new attache case.
[1:15:12] <%MrBorisMakarov> dissonance?
[1:15:12] <%majima666> pitch shifting
[1:15:13] <Nina96> says a lot about how satisfying i find that case organization
[1:15:13] <+LurkerGene> !uptime
[1:15:13] <+Gamerdude951> The U.S. Army supports your channel
[1:15:14] <@Moobot> I've been playing this game for how long? Oh only 1h 15m.
[1:15:14] <sadorno69> this music is in dmc
[1:15:17] <%Ranryu692> can confirm, Spain is weird
[1:15:19] <%patriotrenegade> It actually reminds me of the music in RE7
[1:15:23] <%joylent_blue> nice
[1:15:24] <%DensityD> slick skills
[1:15:26] <%peachy996> There's a silent hill track that sounds like the save room in this
[1:15:27] <%natebud> alli esta
[1:15:27] <%patriotrenegade> EYYYYYY, ACAAAAAAA
[1:15:27] <%Order_of_Mystery> What's not to love about the Red 9? It's a mauser, got a stripper clip and stock, reload animation is SSS tier, and the little flick Leon does at the end to dislodge the stripper clip from the gun is just Kreygasm
[1:15:29] <%legendscar01> Red9 is Perfect
[1:15:30] <%XeroSigmaPrime> I love how dark it is
[1:15:30] <%Ner234> POP
[1:15:32] <%peachy996> It's from Origins
[1:15:32] <%JJCheeker> I love this game
[1:15:32] <%Jekado> pop pop mutha fucker
[1:15:38] <Yummy_Nukes> spain is weird
[1:15:39] <%patriotrenegade> Cojelos, cojelos, cojelos
[1:15:40] <morcego_cinzento_arts> And of course the first kill with the Red9 is a critical headshot
[1:15:42] <%Dragon_Batman> Wait I might be thinking of the one by the lake
[1:15:45] <BoneofMalkav> Pat's 9 is now Red
[1:15:49] <$lotharrio> I recall hiding in the tower for this part of the mpa.
[1:15:49] <GameOver_Here> Man the HD textures look nice.

[1:16:02] <DatAsuna> The worst thing about RE6 was ditching this hit reaction system
[1:16:04] <+dawsfloss> this game doesn't need a remake it still looks amazing
[1:16:06] <Roz_Lynd> visions of killing floor 2 head popping
[1:16:06] <%legendscar01> Pat's middle name is Red9

[1:16:39] <%Order_of_Mystery> DAT CRITICAL HIT RATE THO
[1:16:41] <RyuuAoi> @dragon_batman Loves sexy AF
[1:16:46] <%DensityD> but the TMP tho
[1:16:50] <+Jumpie8> watch Ashley gets kidnapped
[1:16:50] <%Sir_stride> and when fully upgraded. it's as strong as the base shotgun
[1:16:50] <cureneckbeard> I like how Ashley is completely unfazed by this slaughter
[1:16:52] <%DensityD> BibleThump
[1:16:57] <%Dragon_Batman> @RyuuAoi Hell yea it do
[1:17:01] <Yummy_Nukes> @angriestpat but do you love red 9 more than red 13?
[1:17:02] <ohgodscorpions> crazy talk
[1:17:04] <%ultimatetotoro> get him
[1:17:06] <%legendscar01> @AngriestPat What do you have to say to the Blacktail fans?
[1:17:09] <%BionoidLCR> tmp sucks
[1:17:10] <%tiaramaki> I was just about to say that Pat didn't get a Plagas in this area yet LUL
[1:17:11] <%BionoidLCR> SELL IT
[1:17:11] <JimJamr> Play the Wii version you coward!
[1:17:12] <haidanort> wait, didn't pat shit all over the tmp in the lp?
[1:17:13] <%Shadicara> LUL
[1:17:13] <%umbypokochan> geez just use ther ifle for that
[1:17:14] <%worldbrand> :(
[1:17:14] <%chill_o_wisp> OH BOY PLAUGUS
[1:17:15] <%joylent_blue> if you could cower behind Leon Kennedy you'd be pretty calm too
[1:17:16] <%Solidnick18> LUL
[1:17:17] <%patriotrenegade> you have 82 ammo just fuckin unload on him @AngriestPat
[1:17:17] <%MayShip> not a friend
[1:17:17] <Marpolo13> @cureneckbeard she's too busy being turned on by Leon's big dick wagging
[1:17:23] <%Shadicara> Tmp run over bois
[1:17:24] <%JJCheeker> It shoots fast
[1:17:25] <Fujiwara_92> BIG NUMBER VS DO COMBO
[1:17:27] <Serge_12> Angry "Red9" Pat pianodScrub pianodScrub
[1:17:27] <%Aydarkzero> Blacktails handling feels poor
[1:17:31] <%ElenaManetta> This game is extremely dark on my Cintiq monitor which are notoriously bad at color correction, so I keep thinking Pat just has amazing aiming abilities to see in the dark like this.
[1:17:32] <%Sir_stride> but red9 is big number
[1:17:32] <%Sora20030c> why not use cheap TMP ammo for the traps and such
[1:17:32] <RyuuAoi> SELL IT
[1:17:33] <$lotharrio> TMP vs awakened plagas: Shoot out their knees, get sort of close, unload into the squirmy bits.
[1:17:35] <%Afterman_> fuck em
[1:17:35] <LukewarmLuke> You're using it wrong
[1:17:39] <KeystoneA1> True giga-chads use the default pistol the whole game
[1:17:39] <%Order_of_Mystery> I adore Ashley's little fist pump when Leon kills enemies
[1:17:42] <%ElenaManetta> He's going by the light of the storm alone.
[1:17:42] <%peachy996> Blacktail and Punisher arent for me
[1:17:44] <StripesUltimateEdition> i wish we got leon's knife in the RE2 remake
[1:17:44] <%patriotrenegade> I thought you said "black face" for a second
[1:17:46] <haidanort> plagas of gripes
[1:17:48] <%ssjklyco> Pat, you forgot to get the punisher to get free money
[1:17:48] <%Sir_stride> how?
[1:17:50] <%mh9s> Splooshley
[1:17:53] <%legendscar01> @AngriestPat There's boxes everywhere in the village
[1:17:54] <%umbypokochan> i only knife the traps... why waste bullets? stabby stabby trap rap
[1:17:54] <%Dragon_Batman> I like the Punisher's gimmick
[1:17:55] <%AncelDeLambert> TMP is for center mass
[1:17:59] <%Sora20030c> You're supposed to one tap the heads then melee kill them
[1:18:05] <+Hitorio> !! You can slash bear traps to deactivate them?!
[1:18:05] <%JJCheeker> Did you hear about that guy that robbed a bank in black face
[1:18:08] <%optimasmaximas> blacktail=do combo; #blacktailface rise upLUL
[1:18:09] <Yummy_Nukes> was always more of a broken butterfly man myself
[1:18:13] <%natebud> Are you going to buy the mine thrower for those 4-5 times where it just solves the problem?
[1:18:14] <NeroInfinite> TMP is for chest shots not head shots you fool
[1:18:14] <%patriotrenegade> @JJCheeker I did
[1:18:15] <%joylent_blue> where she belongs
[1:18:18] <RyuuAoi> Pat taught me the knife trick years ago. Thanks, Pat.
[1:18:18] <%Meidolaon> Free Punisher sells back for 0
[1:18:20] <%rytisone> trash girl
[1:18:20] <%AncelDeLambert> ASHLEY! Become garbage!
[1:18:20] <President_valentine> pur her where she belongs
[1:18:20] <%majima666> get in that fucking bin
[1:18:21] <%tiaramaki> I used to use Blacktail literally because "Leon use da gun that ADA uses!!"
[1:18:22] <haidanort> ashley more like trashley
[1:18:24] <%RubberFistFight> the way you guys were talking the other day I was expecting her to have like, massive honking gag boob tiddos. Those are actually like... normal tits.
[1:18:26] <%ElenaManetta> I wish the animation was Leon picking her up and throwing her in the trash
[1:18:26] <%nofestu2> LUL
[1:18:26] <%Engwithan_Elder_God> Becky dumpster
[1:18:27] <+Remery_> The best command
[1:18:27] <+Gamerdude951> I just noticed Ashley's boobs jiggle if you nudge her
[1:18:29] <%AncelDeLambert> reload time
[1:18:31] <%Sir_stride> NotLikeThis
[1:18:31] <morcego_cinzento_arts> In RE4 your mission is to rescue a blond young woman from infected europeans. In RE5 in one small segment you fail to rescue a blond young women from infected Africans. In RE6 you play as a blonde young woman fighting off Infected europeans AND chinese
[1:18:31] <+Jumpie8> LUL
[1:18:34] <%Roasted_Pheasant> @JJCheeker It happened in the county next to mine
[1:18:34] <$lotharrio> Seeing her pop open when Leon whistled, made me laugh too hard as a teenager.
[1:18:36] <%ha2ken> Use shotgun..come back for ammo
[1:18:38] <%silverira> Ashley in her natural habitat
[1:18:43] <%legendscar01> Pat just not gonna get the village boxes

[1:19:01] <%Flambage> @AngriestPat Do you make Paige jump in the dumpster if you sense danger?
[1:19:02] <%patriotrenegade> WAIT
[1:19:05] <sadorno69> rifle too tbh
[1:19:06] <%peachy996> How'd he abort his plagas baby?
[1:19:07] <%legendscar01> Pat needs to save the grenades for the house, you people know
[1:19:10] <%supercasualboom> supercasualboom subscribed at Tier 1. They've subscribed for 21 months, currently on a 21 month streak! Shoot, didn‚Äôt realize subbing for 21! that‚Äôs mean I‚Äôm legal...ladies. Pat, can you ever recall a NPC in any genres played had to accompanied or team with that was actually useful and not a walking target shitshow?
[1:19:11] <%patriotrenegade> I havent played RE4 but I can tell the TMP is supposed to be used by unloading into the enemy's chest @AngriestPat
[1:19:11] <%tiaramaki> @sadorno69 Good luck!
[1:19:14] <+Scevda> Ya, if I can never hear the word "egg" in a resident evil game ever again, I would be happy.
[1:19:14] <%natebud> Can't wait for all the coronavirus jokes when RE6 comes around
[1:19:19] <%AncelDeLambert> @Flambage no, Paige makes HIM jump in the dumpster
[1:19:21] <%D3rrtyD4n> nice european accent
[1:19:21] <haidanort> paige is pat's ashley
[1:19:28] <%rytisone> Big Cheese Mendez
[1:19:32] <sadorno69> @tiaramaki thank you :)
[1:19:36] <PunishedMercer_> feels like egg on your face. (and in your body)
[1:19:37] <%patriotrenegade> Pat is Paige's Ashley
[1:19:37] <MenstrualMunchies> Why does the save music sound like Dark Souls?
[1:19:40] <$lotharrio> Yo, chat, you know what I'm talking about when I saw Japanese cold, right?
[1:19:42] <Reizie_Etherealm> VA MANOS
[1:19:43] <%Sir_stride> I honestly dont understand young Pats hatred for the TMP.
[1:19:46] <%JJCheeker> If Paige is Ashley who is Elmo
[1:19:46] <+LeonPup> who's gotta reload?
[1:19:46] <%joylent_blue> i keep hearing them saying YAMERO
[1:19:52] <%AncelDeLambert> @AngriestPat Pat, are you sure you're the Ashley and not Elmo, since he was the one found in the dumpster?

[1:22:05] <%Tyonidus> What are the most OP guns? What guns do speedrunners usually use?

[1:22:35] <haidanort> too much ammo is a good problem to have

[1:32:01] <haidanort> now what would be cool is if you played the rest of the game as luis after that
[1:32:05] <%ranarath> Oh no, 50 crossbolts couldn't kill him but 2 gunshots can.
[1:32:06] <+Hitorio> I guess that's the rational response to Leon aggressively shooting his ass incessantly
[1:32:06] <%Shadicara> Now the ballistics are all his
[1:32:06] <%Th3SmartAlec> "Now I will get to bang Ada"
[1:32:08] <%ClericOfSparda> I love how he acknowledges that you shot him
[1:32:08] <castlerock42> Damn, Leon went out like a bitch.

[1:46:11] <+Hitorio> how she dismantled Chris and Sheva
[1:46:15] <%MelBrooksKA> @Mothman742 Thanks?
[1:46:17] <%MoralCompassGaming> @the_vedo_show Pat is helping Paige find her lost satchel of drugs
[1:46:23] <%Dragon_Batman> It's more Jill's design

[1:46:59] <%tuesti> !raffle
[1:47:04] <%MelBrooksKA> Ashley would be 2 years older than Pat
[1:47:23] <%legendscar01> Pat is a noob at this game
[1:47:28] <Zaphire_Saucypants> fuck Blonde Jill

[1:47:40] <%legendscar01> New Jill sucks
[1:47:41] <haidanort> ^
[1:47:42] <ohgodscorpions> jill being blonde isnt that bad its the blue gimp suit added on that makes the whole thing not work

[1:47:55] <%ElenaManetta> geeze did they find the drug stash yet

[1:48:01] <%MoralCompassGaming> gimp suit LUL
[1:48:02] <%ElenaManetta> they're REALLY good at hiding
[1:48:15] <WaxWitch> no, she just looks horrible as a blonde
[1:48:15] <%legendscar01> Their fucking right now
[1:48:20] <%peachy996> It's funny how the RE movies utilized Blonde Jill and it makes even less sense
[1:48:21] <johnnybelmont_95> What if you got to play as Ashley in RE8
[1:48:25] <chhdez> As we speak!
[1:48:30] <%MelBrooksKA> They have to follow the map on Paige's back @ElenaManetta
[1:48:38] <+Hitorio> Funnily enough, Julia Voth's likeness is fused with my appreciation of Jill. Making her blond? I sleep. Changing her face elicits the "not my Jill" feels
[1:48:42] <%supercasualboom> Pat: Those elusive bear traps!!
[1:48:57] <%peachy996> Oh the face changing is up there too

[1:49:32] <Zaphire_Saucypants> Man must be tired.
[1:49:40] <%FacetiousAF> pat's busy cleaning up the poop in his pants
[1:49:42] <+TheBitingIrish> Weren't REmake 2 Leon and Claire modeled after their VAs?
[1:49:45] <+Hitorio> Jill is also the only one whose face I care for that much, too. The changes to Leon, Claire, and Ada I'm relatively more neutral on
[1:49:54] <%peachy996> Fun fact: RE4 Leon gawdumn but RE6 Leon not interested anymore
[1:49:54] <+Hitorio> Though I certainly have my preferences
[1:49:57] <xxshadowxx416> are they have sex
[1:50:10] <%FacetiousAF> quick, while pat's gone say nice things about him
[1:50:16] <Zaphire_Saucypants> I like new Claire.

[1:54:18] <%Tracazoid> You should allocate more points to your purse vision stat, Pat.
[1:54:20] <%Monkeyweed21> Elmo has it
[1:54:21] <Nina96> i thought u didnt drive

[1:54:44] <$Mothman742> Reminder to chat, if you spam !raffle incessantly that your parents will love you again and the you can win Paige's used mustard bottle :)
[1:54:46] <dankiff> Has she checked the stove?
[1:54:46] <%worldbrand> DO NOT DO THAT, spec into bag proficiency instead. Purse vision is included.
[1:54:47] <%Toynota10> How about you purse on that decision
[1:54:47] <%supercasualboom> Did she check her mustard bottle?
[1:54:49] <%bigdumbidiotguy> I think the path with the 2 chainsaw ladies is harder
[1:54:50] <derap41> If I've ever head of a dump stats that's was ot

[1:56:54] <%Sir_stride> dont you need the semi auto for the regenerators?
[1:56:58] <haidanort> did you know that you can suplex enemies when you play as ashley later? @AngriestPat
[1:57:01] <sharpster78> claim the punisher and then sell it for cash
[1:57:05] <%peachy996> @Hitorio It's only a matter of time before they make her canon
[1:57:06] <%Sir_stride> huh
[1:57:06] <%bigdumbidiotguy> no
[1:57:10] <Nina96> what?
[1:57:10] <%natebud> It's just preferable
[1:57:12] <%bigdumbidiotguy> you can put the scope on both
[1:57:14] <%Sir_stride> TIL
[1:57:15] <President_valentine> the best part of the RE movies is the laser hallway
[1:57:16] <xanderfist> whaddya smellin
[1:57:19] <ohgodscorpions> the bolt action gets REALLY tough to kill regenerators with before they nibble your jiblets
[1:57:24] <Yrefe> you can kill regenerator with a knife
[1:57:28] <Zaphire_Saucypants> you can use the bolt on those fucks
[1:57:30] <%JJCheeker> Bolt action it is cooler

[1:57:48] <%unclekulikov> Hell, I beat El Gigante on the gamecube with the TMP. Def not required.
[1:57:49] <+Hitorio> Remember when Shinji Mikami stopped being a creative consultant for the RE movies because he didn't like where they were headed?
[1:57:51] <%bigdumbidiotguy> knock leg off of regenerator and then knife it to death
[1:57:54] <dankiff> The bolt action is tremendously stronger
[1:57:56] <%ElenaManetta> man
[1:58:00] <+JFrostyBeats> you can kill regenerator with a knife
[1:58:04] <%ElenaManetta> this game's hud and info overlay nad map stuff
[1:58:04] <%natebud> Why buy the map when chat's telling you where everything is constantly?
[1:58:04] <Ultimatefool> You just need to MLG NO SCOPE SNIPE THIS MAN to beat El Gigante

[1:58:13] <%XeroSigmaPrime> @ohgodscorpions What? Bolt action is preferred if you want to gun down them. Semi Auto is only better if youre trying to kill them thru thermal

[1:58:22] <%Sir_stride> itll just jump up and bit your neck
[1:58:22] <%JJCheeker> I always buy the rocket launcher for this
[1:58:22] <%Reaverund> Killing a regen with a knife sounds awful
[1:58:26] <+TheBitingIrish> Oh shit, that's right! You can stun lock the fuckers
[1:58:28] <iamnotaparrot> there's no "required" weapons. you can even beat the final boss without the special rocket launcher

[1:58:48] <+Hitorio> That big guy looks like he needs a massage.
[1:58:48] <%silverira> you dont really need the stock on the TMP unless you want to use like a handgun
[1:58:50] <%bigdumbidiotguy> it's actually really not that bad. he rarely hits you. he gets stunlocked
[1:58:50] <%cdrom321> Striker its leg off and knife its ass to death while it's on the ground.

[2:40:09] <%Zebroneath> To answer this, we need to talk about "parallel universes."
[2:40:11] <%peachy996> @Neo_Kaiser he never comes back
[2:40:12] <%nofestu2> Thats his brother The Blerchant
[2:40:12] <%majima666> what 'is' the merchant

[2:40:37] <%Th3SmartAlec> What do you mean, you didn't realize it was his coat?
[2:40:38] <Valentinius_Anodyne> Perhaps the merchant is merely sending an astral projection
[2:40:39] <%Neo_Kaiser> Does the second Merchant also die?
[2:40:39] <CallingField> Also, if you kill him over here he'll still be alive over there if you check. But he'll never be over here again.
[2:40:39] <+Hitorio> What did the merchant look like as a child?
[2:40:40] <+dmtjinni> pat is crazy

[2:53:11] <+chunkymonkey737> tobacco is the only legal way of getting 'fucked up' while working
[2:53:12] <Bryon_Youngblood> @AngriestPat The craziest surgery anyone in my family has had was my maternal grandma had to get surgery done due to internal bleeding from cancer in her stomach. She was in pretty bad shape when she had to go to the hospital. It was NUTS.

[3:19:18] <+A123yourdead> Listen to yo women!
[3:19:19] <%bevyrage> a hydra is born with 1 head, but stories and legends will often depict a hydra as a dragon with up to 13 heads, though some legends have gone up to 100 or even one thousand.

[3:19:58] <%hussdogrob> generally it starts off with like 9 or 10 heads then if you cut one off it grows back multiple heads where the head was chopped off but usually depiction is like 7-10
[3:19:59] <ratcan_> "for my next trick i will make my sanity disappear"

[3:49:36] <+Hitorio> Imagine Ashley's commentary on your performance being akin to a DMC style meter
[3:49:39] <koolkatdq> Yellow is a good color
[3:49:40] <Zaphire_Saucypants> you know you can destroy those little vases on the desks, right?
[3:49:42] <sonicspark007> its not
[3:49:43] <%takiyami> Effectively infinite
[3:49:44] <OToole42> they arenot
[3:49:45] <Run44forrest> 5x head explosion is worthless when a lot of the endgame enemies have plagas

[3:50:32] <%Sir_stride> There was gonna be some guys with scythes but they didnt spawn
[3:50:35] <koolkatdq> Yellow still a good.

[3:50:40] <%CommanderSqueaks> @rumtumtugnutz I literally have never heard of C+
[3:50:40] <+Hitorio> If you dodge an attack right before it hits you, you activate Crush Time
[3:50:48] <%Keyd00d> a monster's coming
[3:50:48] <%tiaramaki> Are there vases back in the first part?
[3:50:55] <CrabSlacks> it was the chupacabre
[3:50:59] <Zaphire_Saucypants> there are tiny lil vases he can destroy
[3:51:01] <Mrman617> There's usually guys at the top but I think you dying 2 rooms ago might have toned down the dynamic difficulty thing that RE4 has.
[3:51:02] <Zaphire_Saucypants> on the tables
[3:51:04] <%Shadowpint> Can I call you Mr. Pat
[3:51:04] <%natebud> three vases

[3:51:35] <$HyperionXV> No he meant the 2 scythe guys that sometimes spawn depending on dynamic difficulty

[4:08:06] <%RubberFistFight> Aphantasia is a total lack of the ability to form a "mental picture" of something. So if someone says to you "picture an orange", you'll usually get a vivid mental image of a typical californian orange. Someone with Aphantasia can't do that, at all.
[4:08:08] <%spiritofmojave> So there's half truth there

[4:10:59] <%Faustgesicht> @AngriestPat Metacritic rating currently sitting at 0.7
[4:10:59] <shruke> You should read Worm instead, it's a really good book
[4:11:00] <%depressed_skeleton> @AngriestPat I enjoy warcraft reforged. I'm a bad person.
[4:11:00] <Valentinius_Anodyne> Oho, wrong!
[4:11:04] <%TheSniperJoe> They didn't outsource it, the scope was cut halfway through the development and there are some SERIOUSLY incompetent people in positions of power at Blizzard because of their "always promote from within" practice.
[4:11:06] <cahv123> The problem paige is you don't though. Most b
[4:11:06] <%SoFarFetched> Cause you get banned if you try to help people get a refund on forums.
[4:11:06] <%Engwithan_Elder_God> Your game needs to actually work to make actual money.
[4:11:07] <JackalKing> Wut
[4:11:07] <%D3rrtyD4n> atpCap
[4:11:10] <%peachy996> Why make good game? too hard
[4:11:10] <%depressed_skeleton> If you ask for a refund on the blizzard forums you get banned.
[4:11:11] <%joylent_blue> lmfao
[4:11:11] <%StaceMcGate> @AngriestPat if you explain how to get refunds, you got banned on forum
[4:11:12] <%Arxel1> They banned people on forums who explained how to get refunds Pat
[4:11:12] <%Valdorick> @AngriestPat If you ask for a refund, or give advice on how to get a refund, blizzard will ban you on their fourms.
[4:11:13] <%Ner234> Paige no
[4:11:13] <animalxer> They're banning people asking for refunds
[4:11:14] <%HyperBomb21> They probably didn't exepct that the outsource team would botch such a simple port
[4:11:15] <%Psyramics> anyone that talks about refunding WC3 gets banned from blizz forums
[4:11:15] <%Papa_Tak> you havent had to make a good game in a while for money
[4:11:16] <%Spydurman> @shruke the web serial? Worm is awesome
[4:11:17] <trianglehat> you can get banned for telling people how to refund on the forums
[4:11:17] <%Engwithan_Elder_God> Paige, everyone can look down their own pants.

[4:11:19] <%K2YP70C0CK> chk out the quartering yt vid
[4:11:19] <Ran196> they're banning people who ask for refunds or help others get refund
[4:11:20] <%TheSniperJoe> Everyone's scared shitless that there is going to be another wave of layoffs.
[4:11:24] <%K2YP70C0CK> yeyey
[4:11:24] <cahv123> Most people will buy it despite it's low quality. Its a sad state of affairs.
[4:11:25] <JunkyardCrow> Paige put that away jermaDisgust
[4:11:25] <%cvp5127> arent they breaking the law in Australia?
[4:11:25] <%RubberFistFight> @AngriestPat they outsourced it to a malaysian firm called "Lemonsky", apparently they've done a bunch of shit, including stuff on the most recent Spider-man game maybe? The difference is Sony POURED cash on them for it. Activision lowballed the fuck out of it and spent as little as humanly possible.
[4:11:25] <%PrettyThickandStrongDyck> Blizzard wants to dig to china
[4:11:26] <%Dr_Mooose> wow

[4:14:30] <%depressed_skeleton> BAAABAAA!~
[4:14:30] <%ElenaManetta> But what happens when you have an ugly number like 45% of 8.
[4:14:30] <JackalKing> "I don't like it. Thats too much" - Paige, 2020
[4:14:31] <%Decoyhound> dont canadian brain us bro
[4:14:32] <shruke> The brain words don't do numbers

[4:14:35] <CodeV> Na math
[4:14:37] <gsoto83> shit
[4:14:37] <nivlac_555> multipication
[4:14:38] <%AncelDeLambert> BECAUSE THAT'S CUED
[4:14:38] <%TheMattman1313> @AngriestPat This is just the commutative property. 8% of 25 = .08*25 = 25% of 8 = .25 * 8 = .01 * 8 * 25
[4:14:39] <%depressed_skeleton> Is she drunk???
[4:14:40] <Nina96> less bigger number
[4:14:40] <TheArrow_> 25 is big number 4 is little number
[4:14:40] <%GraceTBM> cause she was still thinking of your prior question and not listening
[4:14:40] <+timmc916> multipication
[4:14:40] <Mechazoic_Era> multiplecation

[4:14:53] <%Tman451> america likes fractions
[4:14:56] <%ElenaManetta> 1/4 of 8 looks nicer because you can see the 4 in the 8
[4:14:57] <%RubberFistFight> @AngriestPat wait til she learns that 0.999 recurring is exactly equivalent to 1. I still refuse to believe that, because if 0.999r was the same as 1, it would be 1, not 0.999r
[4:14:57] <%emperordread> But 7 ate 9!
[4:14:57] <%Mr_Pylon> Paige is worried that the math will attack her

[4:39:44] <King_Wolf_Rigger> They still say that
[4:39:44] <%supercasualboom> Fun fact: my high school had us wear ID badges around our neck. I wrote in pen the answers really small behind my badge.
[4:39:44] <%AncelDeLambert> THEY LIED
[4:39:45] <ratcan_> THEY STILL DO SAY THAT
[4:39:47] <Shwepie> But you need to know the process to use a calculator!
[4:39:47] <Run44forrest> THEY STILL SAY THAT
[4:39:48] <%D3rrtyD4n> my trig teacher used to say that
[4:39:48] <%GraceTBM> these days it's too boldfaced
[4:39:49] <trianglehat> do you have a calculator in your pocket, Pat?
[4:39:50] <%Dr_Mooose> they do, and it's fucking dumb
[4:39:53] <Badgerconda_> THE LIARS
[4:39:57] <%depressed_skeleton> Calculators are fucking everywhere
[4:39:58] <%luftraumm1> I'd watch a whole stream of this shit
[4:39:59] <%Order_of_Mystery> they still said that in 2017, Pat
[4:40:03] <%GraceTBM> everyone these days already have smartphones, it doesn't hold up
[4:40:05] <King_Wolf_Rigger> Every single engineer I know ALWAYS has access to a calculator.
[4:40:08] <%TwinBat> we had calculator watches back then tho
[4:40:10] <IntrepidEye> I remember at some point that made it a requirement to have a TI calculator
[4:40:11] <%genowyn> Actual mathematicians use calculators
[4:40:12] <%RubberFistFight> YOU COULD LITERALLY BUY THINGS CALLED "POCKET CALCULATORS"
[4:40:16] <%K2YP70C0CK> woolieWUT
[4:40:16] <%chiluzza> WHY THE FUCK WOULD YOUJ HAVE TWO DIFFERENT DAYS FOR THE LANGUAGES
[4:40:19] <%bevyrage> i actually had a calculator in my pocket because i always forgot to put it in the backpack, and the teacher would ask for my calculator and i'd look for it then go '...i forgot to bring it anyway'
[4:40:22] <%SvenHolgersson> THE FUCKS THAT MEAN
[4:40:22] <%ElenaManetta> HAHAHAHA
[4:40:23] <%RubberFistFight> Calculators FOR YOUR POCKET
[4:40:24] <%depressed_skeleton> finally math
[4:40:26] <%leinadtonu> my dick is a calculator.
[4:40:28] <%GraceTBM> the real answer is that it's faster to do the simpler stuff in your head instead of going to a calculator for every little thing
[4:40:29] <%Nina96> sounds like bs but i believe it
[4:40:31] <%ElenaManetta> U were a smartass 11 year old
[4:40:32] <%RubberFistFight> fuck me teachers are fucking full of shit, jesus christ.
[4:40:32] <%TheMattman1313> @AngriestPat Paige for engineers yeah they do do math problems.
[4:40:33] <%genowyn> But that's because math class isn't teaching you mathematics until uni, it's teaching you arithmetic
[4:40:33] <TimetodiveLTX> ok boomer
[4:40:33] <%cvp5127> god derivative are useless
[4:40:33] <%Ranryu692> I've had a calculator in my pocket for 18 years, since my 11th birthday
[4:40:34] <PrimeNeverproc> calculators were mandatory in my highschool
[4:40:34] <FstSergeant8595> @chiluzza they live in Canada lol
[4:40:34] <%ssjklyco> who does math in the job interview

[4:40:39] <%SvenHolgersson> Calculate my balls you fucking gaslighting fucks
[4:40:41] <%Neo_Kaiser> The truth. You need to learn your basic maths cause you're most likely gonna end up in a shitty retail job or a dead end job where you need to figure out change.
