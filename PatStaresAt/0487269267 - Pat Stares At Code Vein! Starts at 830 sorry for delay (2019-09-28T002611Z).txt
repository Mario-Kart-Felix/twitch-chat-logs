[0:35:42] <%Laecerelius> So is that a short sword you're using? Seems kinda small for anime weaponry.
[0:35:42] <+timblenaut> motion blur + twitch encoding = bad viewer experience

[0:39:22] <RupanSen> you can tell by the anime
[0:39:22] <+PleasantLee> it has God Eater skin DLC
[0:39:23] <%Soul_Intern> FUCKING BLOOD MAGIC
[0:39:23] <$Yakobro> waow
[0:39:24] <%mh9s> its the Tremere
[0:39:26] <Mr_Strut> Is God Eater just monster hunter with hoodies instead of armor?
[0:39:26] <WeebFever> The "Coward" blood code
[0:39:27] <%ThatOneGameTester> I never played that series, i heard it's a monster hunter type of game
[0:39:27] <%ScreamLord> @AngriestPat Another streamer/youtuber called Rurikhan was able to give his character a beard
[0:39:27] <Trash_leviathan> blood mage fuck yea
[0:39:28] <%starotter70> Cum Shot
[0:39:31] <bruno_silv0> game sound seems low to me
[0:39:32] <BourneWarrior> Magic big strong
[0:39:35] <+Papafleish> I'm still in a dream Cum Eater
[0:39:36] <%Aztec50> "We made this weapon at first to hold the knife at the end, and then we figured out it could shoot bullets too"
[0:39:37] <Goldenwolf98> Thats weird
[0:39:39] <LandOfTheWay> Mag Builds DansGame
[0:39:41] <foreverN2dust> so god eater copied monster hunter, this copied souls, what would you guys like to see now?
[0:39:43] <Marpolo13> so like cheats?
[0:39:43] <%demegodz> Classes
[0:39:44] <KishinGrek> oh wow, so first the do Monster Hunter now they do dark souls
[0:39:46] <%Razputin217> Its the Job System
[0:39:48] <%miguelrod777> blood magicains juts like my bedtime storyies
[0:39:49] <corepercentlives> Weeb Eater
[0:39:50] <%connos_procrastination> this seems alot more together than god eater was
[0:39:51] <%deviljhojho94> yeah he tattoed the beard
[0:39:54] <%KitsuneManami> @AngriestPat its face makeup
[0:39:58] <%SlimeSlimeSlime> Placing the extra hair on the fair! :O
[0:39:59] <reddpop_> Didnt max do it too?
[0:39:59] <%doc_ock_rokc> WITH THE BANGS! Ohhh
[0:39:59] <%Ninestempest> god eater is already weeb
[0:39:59] <Sapphire_Breeze> you can put additional hair bangs on your chin
[0:40:00] <LaughingCatt> Its a fake tattoo beard
[0:40:01] <shadowmaksim> @AngriestPat You just have to stuff those fuzzy hats in your chin for beards.
[0:40:02] <pennykettle_> could you put a hair accessory on the face like you did with the hat on the knee? @AngriestPat
[0:40:04] <%Ninestempest> this is double weeb
[0:40:08] <+Papafleish> how am I already overwhelmed by systems
[0:40:09] <ShichiNoBushi> Probably by manipulating the extra hair.
[0:40:09] <%ScreamLord> @AngriestPat It was a shitty beard, but still
[0:40:11] <+Armeggadon> You also learn like passives by using certain weapon types, that once you use them long enough you can use them with any weapon. It's kinda bonkers
[0:40:12] <+PleasantLee> ah, you the hair accessory items and push them into your characters chin
[0:40:15] <%StaceMcGate> fake beard merkin
[0:40:16] <%Animorphimagi> hair extensions = beard
[0:40:17] <%deviljhojho94> its as real as it goes for the japanese tomatoSad
[0:40:17] <Arrior_Septem> can you move the extra hair around the face?
[0:40:18] <Dragamation> i played the demo for god eater 3 and it was fun so
[0:40:19] <%GrayMatterMiner> did i miss the character creator/the real game?
[0:40:20] <Marpolo13> MAGIC
[0:40:22] <Sapphire_Breeze> @AngriestPat you can put the additional hair bangs on your chin
[0:40:22] <%Nope80808> you can use the accessories to make a beard man
[0:40:24] <didi223> You can use hair extensions to fake a beard
[0:40:26] <auspiciousdgg> Ah, yes, the three genders - Fighter, Ranger and Caster
[0:40:27] <Jontman42> That's just pyromancy
[0:40:27] <%Shadicara> That was a big fire ball
[0:40:27] <%Thalchampz> totally not pyromancy
[0:40:27] <butthurtdave> This is a very in-depth tutorial
[0:40:28] <jackythefrost> Ive been playing this for 4 hours, its good. Only issue is light weapons feel a bit "too light" like instead of swing a long sword it feels like swinging a large dagger, but its fun
[0:40:32] <%BallerSwagBro9k> @graymatterminer yup
[0:40:35] <bruno_silv0> the are no beards in anime land
[0:40:37] <%GrayMatterMiner> rip
[0:40:43] <Marpolo13> shocker
[0:40:45] <%ThatOneGameTester> eye-core? isn't it ickor?
[0:40:46] <Ks201> You can put any accessories anywhere on your character
[0:40:47] <%KitsuneManami> @AngriestPat Oh yea, you gotta be careful on that
[0:40:49] <%demegodz> BOOM
[0:40:49] <%DesuDesuDokiDoki> YEYEYEE
[0:40:51] <thecrabgodrulerofcrabs> the fun thing with the blood codes is if you use a bunch to the point of maxing out their "experience" you can become a ludicrous skill fiend
[0:40:51] <Dragamation> so this is enjoyable
[0:40:53] <%StaceMcGate> feels like Pat is playing a Fates game right now
[0:40:54] <%NeroInfinite> It clips almost as badly as viera's inFFXIV.
[0:40:55] <Tucker0603> rad
[0:40:55] <Escherite> great job, Revolver Ocelot
[0:40:56] <%ScreamLord> P-pretty good

[0:40:57] <%transporterthesequel> That's a CHONKY gun
[0:40:58] <%zamzoph> only villains are ugly in animeeeeee
[0:41:00] <+demonsamura> trying to decide if i should get this or the surge 2
[0:41:00] <%zamzoph> @AngriestPat does character gender make a diff worth considering like Astral Chain or even Dark Souls 3?
[0:41:00] <%MassConnect> so what you're saying is they're a CLIP HAZATD
[0:41:00] <+PleasantLee> oh no your rad beard will clip through your dumb edgy tokyo ghoul gasmask
[0:41:04] <pennykettle_> Remember the words of the Trouple king. "It's pronounced eye-chor"
[0:41:06] <Finakala> Eyecore is the correct pronunciation for Ichor
[0:41:10] <Marpolo13> does it?
[0:41:12] <%Soul_Intern> OH
[0:41:13] <tri3dgE027> Tutorials... why... they already perfected it in God Eater 3, why did they return to this type xliceREEEE

[0:54:55] <Marpolo13> it's a pick ya nerd
[0:54:55] <+HelloImTom08> pat will love thise since you dont lvl up stats LUL
[0:54:56] <%grim_abel> Bloodcodes are mainly stats as NEARLY every gift can be used by every code once mastered.
[0:54:56] <%GarbageNirvana> So how's anime vampire souls so far
[0:54:57] <atlas_pooped> this is very overwhelming
[0:54:58] <%PROUD2beGINGER> No friendly fire too

[0:55:18] <Marpolo13> LOL
[0:55:19] <jackythefrost> @AngriestPat The pipe is pretty much a broken dagger from DS1
[0:55:19] <%Typhaeon> Boy that doesn't look weighty at all
[0:55:21] <Finakala> Is your guy a Super Mutant
[0:55:22] <+sixcubit> threre's absolutely no sense of how things should weigh in this game
[0:55:23] <%Shadicara> Just a slab of concrete
[0:55:24] <%ArcanumMBD> the animation reset after a swing looks fucking jank with that "hammer"
[0:55:24] <3xgilly> sry @AngriestPat what do you mean by level ups are global?
[0:55:25] <%MrBorisMakarov> does that guy just have reinhardts hammer
[0:55:26] <%grim_abel> You just need to rebind blocking, and gift usage
[0:55:28] <%CrypticMochi> Base weapons only run!
[0:55:28] <%tweedler92> Brick stick
[0:55:30] <deepestdahkness> that's a boost hammer
[0:55:30] <%FluffiTamamo> RESPECT THE REBAR
[0:55:32] <%ArcanumMBD> makes it look weightless

[0:55:53] <%goose_attack_almanac> Or kill it while it sleeps
[0:55:53] <Zebroneath> There's something gratifying about wie;ding a huge slab of concrete
[0:55:54] <%SilvaChariot0133> Nice Backstab
[0:55:55] <SomeOtherNeb> FUCK
[0:55:55] <%miguelrod777> this world sucks
[0:55:55] <%MagickBurritoh> ANAL FISTING

[0:56:03] <jimmytwofeet> SO ANIME
[0:56:04] <%Charuzu> anime
[0:56:05] <%dekkitout> That was Tokyo Ghoul af
[0:56:05] <Valdorick> But... does it make you immune during the animation?
[0:56:06] <Goldenwolf98> That will get old quick
[0:56:06] <LaughingCatt> does it play that every time?
[0:56:08] <+aslfrasle> aynahl feesting
[0:56:08] <Apoc_666> RAD
[0:56:09] <%deviljhojho94> Stick em and suck em
[0:56:10] <+Caped_Eggy> Does that happen everytime?
[0:56:12] <%CrypticMochi> My spine!
[0:56:12] <+buf0rdfr1nk> I'm using tilt controls!
[0:56:13] <%goose_attack_almanac> Why did your mask come off for that animation.
[0:56:13] <AnacondaVirtue> A N I M E
[0:56:14] <%PinkSuprende> You can turn off the zoom in and obtuse camera work in the options
[0:56:14] <%tweedler92> Anal "Feasting"
[0:56:22] <%firehawk_420> I take it the devs like Tokyo ghoul
[0:56:25] <+bellicoseweeb> that would be real annoying the 300th time
[0:56:26] <+CaptainGrime> right up his bum
[0:56:26] <%CrimsonCore90> But I thought blood Bourne was monster souls
[0:56:26] <%deviljhojho94> oh cool

[0:56:51] <%doc_ock_rokc> So its not a soulsborne!
[0:56:54] <Dementedpenguin> That's very unSouls-like
[0:56:55] <marvel877> can you walk off cliffs though?
[0:56:55] <%Charuzu> baby game for babies!
[0:56:57] <+Lost_Zombie> You totally can just not here
[0:56:58] <%grim_abel> You can if you are rolling, but the ranger's roll is different.
[0:56:58] <%shiny_prinny> nioh could have used that shit
[0:57:02] <%Basch71> you can still walk off
[0:57:03] <Donchalant402> I actually can, just not here
[0:57:08] <%SilvaChariot0133> You can totally walk/get knocked off tho
[0:57:09] <+gannondaddy> you cant dodge off lcliffs YET
[0:57:12] <CoryFTWs> Depending on what type of armor wearing changes backstab animation too
[0:57:13] <DXLelouch24> lol no trust me you need regen, this shit gets had as balls
[0:57:16] <Donchalant402> I rolled off a cliff later
[0:57:18] <DXLelouch24> hard*
[0:57:25] <Marpolo13> AXE
[0:57:29] <TheAmokz> i walked off a cliff 30 seconds ago
[0:57:30] <Finakala> AND MY AXE
[0:57:34] <Trash_leviathan> i like that you have a party in this souls game
[0:57:38] <%StaceMcGate> attack go up, speed go down
[0:57:38] <%GarbageNirvana> So where does this game's vampires fall on the scale of Twilight to Lost Boys

[0:57:51] <%Typhaeon> Cool
[0:57:53] <%ALTRNico> apatBig
[0:57:55] <%transporterthesequel> Huh
[0:57:55] <%PROUD2beGINGER> yes please
[0:57:55] <shotgang86> dude WTF I want this game now
[0:57:59] <WeebFever> Whoa
[0:58:00] <bluebiscuit94> SCARY
[0:58:01] <%grim_abel> They have a pre-order bonus that is literally God Eater weapons
[0:58:02] <%deviljhojho94> ah shit man
[0:58:06] <%MintMuffinGamer> Well time to Axe around.
[0:58:09] <%shiny_prinny> his voice actings is scary
[0:58:11] <dodgy_dingo_> so this is a vampire game?
[0:58:11] <%PinkSuprende> The movesets between weapons in the same class are not necessarily the same
[0:58:13] <+phtevenfry> axes are just sharp hammers
[0:58:19] <%StaceMcGate> Oliver is 100% the Magician Arcana
[0:58:22] <%Futurecity10> Man, I really dont like the look or feel of the game
[0:58:22] <%Bad1uck> so how's code vampyre?
[0:58:27] <%PinkSuprende> There's four Bayonet movesets that I know of
[0:58:31] <Marpolo13> @phtevenfry or are hammers just dull axes?
[0:58:35] <Finakala> Absolutey Magician
[0:58:37] <%Shadicara> Chop these fuckers pat
[0:58:39] <jackythefrost> @dodgy_dingo_ A post-apocolyptic anime vampire game
[0:58:48] <ShichiNoBushi> How original.
[0:58:56] <LaughingCatt> A hammer is just an axe that got smooshed
[0:58:57] <%Razputin217> You will lose your Souls, over and over again
[0:58:58] <worldbrand> I wonder if this game will have fog ga-- i mean mist passages
[0:59:00] <Tucker0603> AXES RULE
[0:59:08] <+Caped_Eggy> I don't know why they bother talking about this, just say go play dark souls
[0:59:08] <Strider222> BIG IRON
[0:59:08] <worldbrand> vapor entryways
[0:59:09] <+phtevenfry> @Marpolo13 when a ax dulls, it just returns to it's hammer lineage
[0:59:12] <%ArcanumMBD> oh now, the eye-Ron is back
[0:59:17] <%ArcanumMBD> no*
[0:59:17] <%transporterthesequel> Wait WHAT
[0:59:18] <LorcaNomad> pat how's the tiddy souls so far
[0:59:19] <Copperama> Iron so far away
[0:59:20] <%valriot> A Aron
[0:59:21] <ShichiNoBushi> How iron-ic.
[0:59:21] <Finakala> Haze Highways
[0:59:22] <Marpolo13> @phtevenfry ah but of course
[0:59:27] <+buf0rdfr1nk> Eyeeyeron
[0:59:34] <%transporterthesequel> What was that blood anime?
[0:59:37] <%GarbageNirvana> I am interested to see what their take on a Souls game is though cause I wasn't thrilled with their take on Monster Hunter
[0:59:40] <Finakala> You mean Blood?
[0:59:44] <+phtevenfry> even if you remove the axe head, the handle is still a club
[0:59:46] <worldbrand> that guy talks like a DD Pawn

[1:00:10] <%doc_ock_rokc> Katanas let yu vergil
[1:00:12] <%GarbageNirvana> Yeah
[1:00:12] <%PinkSuprende> Equipment weight isn't Total, it's per weapon
[1:00:14] <%SilvaChariot0133> Your weight is equipped-weapon dependent
[1:00:15] <%Shadicara> Fat rolls
[1:00:17] <jackythefrost> @GarbageNirvana So far general consensis is that game Journo's hate this game cause anime tiddys but everyone else really likes it
[1:00:17] <ShichiNoBushi> So light roll and fat roll?

[1:00:36] <Finakala> That's a Bloodborne move right there
[1:00:44] <fehraf> this game has a shit load of mobs when you go to the different zones
[1:00:46] <%galaxyswirl> GUN
[1:00:49] <fehraf> so they vary
[1:00:59] <%PinkSuprende> You can cross class them now
[1:01:04] <%SilvaChariot0133> can be equipped on other jobs
[1:01:05] <+NitronStreams> THE ZOMBIES HAVE GUNS
[1:01:06] <%StaceMcGate> you mastered the gifs, your meme skills increase
[1:01:06] <%grim_abel> You can use them in a different class
[1:01:07] <troxcree> You can use them in other classes now.
[1:01:07] <%GarbageNirvana> @jackythefrost Gonna have to see what destructoid has to say, they don't let tiddy factor into their reviews
[1:01:09] <%Basch71> mastered skills can carry over to other roles
[1:01:12] <overlordkog> Wow, I just discovered you get one of those tail things from Tokyo Ghoul as a backstab animation in this game.

[1:01:15] <+Lost_Zombie> @AngriestPat Lets you use them with different codes
[1:01:15] <$Yakobro> @AngriestPat mastering means you can use them on different classes
[1:01:15] <%Sokumotanaka> @C0baltCrusade No VT
[1:01:17] <%Tearonex> @AngriestPat Apparently your weight is equipped weapon dependent
[1:01:17] <%Bad1uck> one day poise will work as the community intends it too so it makes sense /works

[1:01:32] <Donchalant402> lets you use them on other class types
[1:01:34] <%Basch71> basically you can min max your blood codes with the skills based on your weapons
[1:01:34] <shadowmaksim> You can use them on any class (blood code) now, at least if they meet the right proficiency requirements.
[1:01:34] <%Elemntion> where are the waifus -.-
[1:01:35] <Astar_NoName> You can use gifts outside the class after mastering them.

[1:12:20] <%SirKamBam> Drop your shield
[1:12:21] <jackythefrost> DS1 parrying is lenient
[1:12:21] <Marpolo13> not really a stand no

[1:13:01] <%MonsieurHedge> MonsieurHedge subscribed with Twitch Prime. They've subscribed for 6 months, currently on a 2 month streak! a bottomless curse, a bottomless sea, accepting of all that there is and can be. seek the Anime Blood, pat.
[1:13:01] <%ScreamLord> @AngriestPat He looks like somekind of elephant freakazoid
[1:13:05] <%Frostydough1> is that THE UNTITLES GOOSE GAME
[1:13:08] <butthurtdave> wait so your clothes are a live and a part of you? like KLK?

[1:13:13] <%CourageTheCat> @AngriestPat the devil trigger is when u put the sleeves on
[1:13:13] <$Dakuu75> jacket-parries, wtf lol
[1:13:22] <Escherite> reminds me of that crap from Tokyo Ghoul
[1:13:23] <ISkyHunterI> The darkness game was so good
[1:13:26] <bearalin> Is this the beginning?
[1:13:31] <Marpolo13> Neat
[1:13:34] <jackythefrost> The very beginning yea
[1:13:35] <%rumtumtugnutz> This is Anime Dark Souls from the team that made Anime Monster Hunter, right?
[1:13:36] <lotharaxe> So many weapons already
[1:13:38] <+Reveresao> @angriestpat first jacket has a easier parry timing
[1:13:40] <shadowmaksim> @AngriestPat I don't know if you noticed but every time you land a drain attack, your Icor cap increases. Every blood code has its own starting Icor and Icor cap.
[1:13:40] <%DesuDesuDokiDoki> cool
[1:13:45] <themisticmist2000> HeyGuys
[1:13:45] <%GrayMatterMiner> just fuckin rolling in weapons over here
[1:13:46] <%CourageTheCat> @AngriestPat do the weapons transform
[1:13:51] <Marpolo13> I am a fan of lances/polearms. not bad
[1:13:54] <themisticmist2000> Darkness!
[1:13:54] <+smevvster> Yo I really wanna play this game, but I can't warrant it at full price. Can't wait for a sale.
[1:13:59] <tri3dgE027> H0nt3r Axe
[1:14:05] <%GeneralSCPatton> Those wails are a little Eren titan-esque
[1:14:05] <%ScreamLord> @AngriestPat These dude do look like more evolved Abyss creatures from Oolacile
[1:14:07] <$Sphincter_Spelunker> halberds best berds
[1:14:08] <%DesuDesuDokiDoki> yes
[1:14:10] <Finakala> A hoonter must hoont
[1:14:11] <RaimeTT> this game looks so freaking clunky
[1:14:12] <%mh9s> polearms always the bes
[1:14:15] <%rumtumtugnutz> Fardeesh?
[1:14:21] <TheAmokz> You missed a sweihander!

[1:14:28] <%Teyaric> Am I the only one getting "Lvl one Warframe" vibes?
[1:14:32] <%CourageTheCat> lmao
[1:14:32] <DefaultSettiings> @smevvster GreenManGaming has it cheaper
[1:14:42] <+Armeggadon> he's over weight on hunter, get ready for fat roll
[1:14:43] <projecthazoid> Bardiche?
[1:14:49] <%rumtumtugnutz> I bet this is pretty similar to God Eater.
[1:15:00] <%transporterthesequel> Yeah that window is SUPER big
[1:15:03] <Coffee_JD> that screen shake fucks wtih my eyes
[1:15:05] <+TinyLittleDancer> !uptime
[1:15:05] <%AncelDeLambert> the screen shakes WAY too much during that
[1:15:05] <WeebFever> That looks rad but I hate that screenshake
[1:15:05] <@Moobot> I've been playing this game for how long? Oh only 1h 15m.
[1:15:08] <Marpolo13> yup
[1:15:12] <jackythefrost> @RaimeTT Its pretty much DS1, which means yea it plays well but the animations are jank as fuck
[1:15:13] <DSD24> @rumtumtugnutz Its made by the same devs
[1:15:13] <%Shadicara> FAT
[1:15:19] <+phtevenfry> I'll show you fat rolls
[1:15:20] <Allroc> OpieOP
[1:15:21] <%transporterthesequel> Do you fat roll with gun?
[1:15:23] <%Laecerelius> Fat Rolling Pat
[1:15:24] <Marpolo13> @Armeggadon damn he figured it out faster than I hoped LUL
[1:15:25] <%rumtumtugnutz> @DSD24 I know
[1:15:25] <%gatoralus> like the gameplay seems decent, but the anime story, builds, and flashy attacks are what makes me wanna buy this
[1:15:26] <%AncelDeLambert> @rumtumtugnutz I hope not, GE3 bored the crap out of me
[1:15:27] <%takiyami> Become Fat
[1:15:27] <eiightbiitt> the Fat Evil
[1:15:29] <$Sphincter_Spelunker> excuse you, that's big boned rolling
[1:15:30] <%bevyrage> i like how the fat roll is just a dark souls roll
[1:15:31] <%Thalchampz> SourPls
[1:15:31] <%dekkitout> Big Poise 4 Big Boiz
[1:15:35] <WeebFever> Music for the SLIMELADS

[1:15:55] <WeebFever> You can't shoot a slime with a gun fuck off
[1:16:01] <Donchalant402> @AngriestPat that charged heavy shot for the gun is good on groups
[1:16:01] <%Enz0ned> ds1 slimes lol
[1:16:03] <%AncelDeLambert> @AngriestPat is it possible to turn off the screen shake on your jacket? It's a real eye strainer
[1:16:13] <xenoboost> just got the hype music for the slimes huh?
[1:16:13] <%rumtumtugnutz> @AncelDeLambert I didn't care for it either. But this is made by the same studio, so I expect there's gonna be some similarities
[1:16:15] <silverira> @AngriestPat does this game have multiplayer?
[1:16:15] <Marpolo13> LOL
[1:16:17] <%Thalchampz> GOT GOT

[1:16:26] <Rhonne> nice
[1:16:28] <Finakala> They aren't DS1 slimes unless they drop on your head and fuck your entire skull
[1:16:32] <Marpolo13> close enough
[1:16:41] <%bevyrage> did that slime drop an item?
[1:16:41] <RaimeTT> @jackythefrost it's not just that. I feel the movement is so weird and the weapons don't a satisfying impact.
[1:16:43] <Marpolo13> hahahaha
[1:16:45] <%Teyaric> Oh, instead of Witch Time, it's combat advantage you can spend on a BIG move
[1:16:47] <Rhonne> how has the game been so far?
[1:16:51] <%invisi_bliss> you have juggles?
[1:16:57] <RaimeTT> @jackythefrost make*
[1:16:57] <$Sphincter_Spelunker> Hmmm. Haven't seen any anime tiddies in awhile now.
[1:16:59] <%NovaKnightmare> God those things are cool

[1:17:08] <%Saltmeisterr> YOO when did pat get wolves?
[1:17:10] <%PanicSwytch> Target and Amazon have Code Vein for $49.99
[1:17:12] <+megaotter> gives me "The Darkness" vibes
[1:17:14] <%BarbellGoose> I like how he ran up just to politely wait for you to finish killing his friend.
[1:17:17] <jou_star> Disrespect!
[1:17:17] <shadowmaksim> @AngriestPat If you're interested, there was a greatsword you missed further back.
[1:17:23] <%TheBitingIrish> Does that beret make you do sick gun spins?
[1:17:24] <%rumtumtugnutz> Weeb Dark Souls, from the makers of Weeb Monster Hunter (which is already kind of a weeb game)
[1:17:25] <%daemonazaezal> How long has this been going for? an hour??
[1:17:27] <Donchalant402> check your useable items
[1:17:28] <DefaultSettiings> @Sphincter_Spelunker because the lunatic picked a male character NotLikeThis
[1:17:28] <%rumtumtugnutz> TM
[1:17:32] <ISkyHunterI> The mask and the appendages scream tokyo ghoul
[1:17:33] <AnacondaVirtue> It's an Estus Shard
[1:17:37] <+Dragon4234> @AngriestPat It gives you more recover permanently
[1:17:39] <KosOrSomeSayKosm_> STICC
[1:17:42] <Sapphire_Breeze> you need to use it
[1:17:43] <Donchalant402> estus shard
[1:17:45] <$SweetCheeksTrap> There's a new Auto-Blow that uses AI to provide a better experience.
[1:17:50] <%gatoralus> this game is also 41 us dollars on cdkeys
[1:17:53] <+TinyLittleDancer> The enemies look like bloodborne main characters
[1:18:00] <Ks201> You have to use the extender to have more heals
[1:18:00] <%Binary_Fireball> How's Pat liking it?
[1:18:02] <%kujofire990> look like magic missle basically
[1:18:07] <%bevyrage> why would you support cdkeys dude
[1:18:08] <%GarbageNirvana> New and exciting autoblow innovations
[1:18:11] <%PinkSuprende> YEah Pat you gotta USE the extender from inventory
[1:18:12] <%Binary_Fireball> this game was meh at e3
[1:18:13] <RaimeTT> @rumtumtugnutz MH is good weeb. what bandai makes is generic looking weeb
[1:18:17] <%Remery_> aww sick the Auto-Blows out
[1:18:25] <%Teyaric> Weaving of spells into combo?
[1:18:25] <DSD24> Not Fist Mages
[1:18:32] <%PanicSwytch> Ive had bad luck buying in CDkeys
[1:18:36] <%dekkitout> Mages blow in a game like this? Who woulda thunk...
[1:18:39] <%Muzzle131> mages I think are meant as supports for co-op
[1:18:43] <Sapphire_Breeze> Pat you need to use the item you got
[1:18:48] <%DesuDesuDokiDoki> wew
[1:18:49] <%ssjklyco> Hello
[1:18:50] <Allroc> dink
[1:18:53] <butthurtdave> more like Code Woolie
[1:18:55] <RaimeTT> Mage sucks? LUL
[1:18:58] <%GarbageNirvana> So far these monsters are really kinda...cartoony?
[1:18:58] <rufus2k2> dem hits need to be chunkier
[1:19:01] <%Cthulos> @DefaultSettiings Go watch Woolie's stream, you big girl zoneSmug
[1:19:01] <%Shadicara> No what if he needs the item later Kappa
[1:19:02] <Donchalant402> you have a shitty weapon on
[1:19:04] <%Remery_> Mages is better when you get a melee partner
[1:19:09] <Dman707> i was told this game has big boobs did i miss them?
[1:19:10] <Donchalant402> put the bayonet on
[1:19:11] <%Kiiper> mage is fantastic
[1:19:14] <%gatoralus> fair enough guys i usually use GMG
[1:19:24] <%Muzzle131> @Dman707 yes but they'll be back
[1:19:25] <KoryMccool> i thought magic was op in the demo
[1:19:27] <Marpolo13> oh?
[1:19:27] <reiju_22> @Dman707 they'll be back soon
[1:19:29] <%DesuDesuDokiDoki> item
[1:19:29] <rufus2k2> cool enemy designs
[1:19:32] <Dman707> thank god
[1:19:34] <SomeOtherNeb> !uptime
[1:19:34] <@Moobot> I've been playing this game for how long? Oh only 1h 19m.
[1:19:36] <%GarbageNirvana> nice
[1:19:36] <+CounterBeard> Looks smooth
[1:19:37] <%ssjklyco> Look at that anime Revolver ocelot
[1:19:40] <Nazgul240> YOU JUST PASSED A DROPPED ITEM
[1:19:42] <jackythefrost> @Dman707
[1:19:42] <Trash_leviathan> you walked over an item
[1:19:43] <DefaultSettiings> @Cthulos It's a difficult choice. Woolie has a girl but plays like shit. Pat has a guy but plays watchably NotLikeThis
[1:19:45] <%GarbageNirvana> Never did like Dark Souls mages
[1:19:48] <DSD24> "Use this dagger to kill yourself"
[1:19:49] <+nekodelic> ITEM
[1:19:51] <Valdorick> @Cthulos But the last time we got told to watch woolies stream for the girls, he picked a boy.
[1:19:52] <SomeOtherNeb> oh no you've got the Byleth coat
[1:19:53] <%DesuDesuDokiDoki> ooh it links up
[1:19:54] <kaine5150> You need to use that extension factor
[1:19:55] <$Sphincter_Spelunker> @Dman707 ya did. she's being held hostage by randos that pushed us down this hole
[1:19:59] <Donchalant402> @AngriestPat bayonet is WAY better then the dinky starter pipe for the mage
[1:20:01] <%miguelrod777> items
[1:20:05] <Sapphire_Breeze> use the estus item
[1:20:05] <+Dragon4234> @AngriestPat Hey Pat that Regen item you got increases your recover cap
[1:20:10] <Rhonne> i like your sweet jacket that you're too cool to actually wear
[1:20:11] <IndoorSitup> Breadcrumbs, I like to call em.
[1:20:14] <%DesuDesuDokiDoki> this is very polished
[1:20:15] <%Nobrev> sparkly on floor blind stumbo
[1:20:16] <RaimeTT> @Dman707 Yes. almost all the girls have really awkward looking boobs LUL
[1:20:18] <$ZerephTheFirst> So what's the consensus on this game so far?
[1:20:20] <%AncelDeLambert> so this is one of those stories where "vampire" is just a colloquialism for "fucking demon monstrosity that looks like a human"
[1:20:20] <%GarbageNirvana> @someotherneb The sleeves on this one come to life and eat people, to be fair
[1:20:22] <Finakala> Bloodborne item cap mechanics, always nice
[1:20:32] <rufus2k2> he looks like Doctrine Dark! That's what was bugging me!
[1:20:37] <%grim_abel> Bayonet is best weapon for the mage. They have the highest ichor pool so they shoot the most. Bayonets also scale off WIll and Dex.
[1:20:39] <%UW_Duncan> shard. is this loss?
[1:20:41] <Donchalant402> @AngriestPat up is progress
[1:20:43] <%ssjklyco> Did you find Anor Londo yet?
[1:20:47] <rufus2k2> Explosive~
[1:20:56] <Dementedpenguin> >_>
[1:20:57] <%bread_assassin> Down's a dead end
[1:20:58] <%StaceMcGate> disturbing lack of anime tiddies at the moment tho
[1:20:59] <Allroc> FeelsGoodMan
[1:20:59] <%Saltmeisterr> F E E L
[1:21:00] <%kujofire990> makes you FEEL Like spiderman
[1:21:00] <%KitkatRai> It feel good
[1:21:02] <%Remery_> But Katana Mage tho
[1:21:02] <+ahdurian> just got in stream. is this another souls-type game? it looks like one to me
[1:21:04] <%DesuDesuDokiDoki> BONFIRE
[1:21:05] <%dekkitout> Are ya feelin' it, Mr. Krabs?
[1:21:05] <IndoorSitup> Kimochi ii?
[1:21:05] <+Bear_Mane> feel of those anime tiddies
[1:21:05] <Marpolo13> rip those guys
[1:21:06] <%wolfofsound> is he hooked on a feeling?
[1:21:06] <SnekForce1> Game nformer 6.5 LUL
[1:21:07] <$Sphincter_Spelunker> looks a little slow. but we're still in tutorial area
[1:21:07] <%ElenaManetta> confirmed for pat likes to feel good
[1:21:07] <SomeOtherNeb> @GarbageNirvana oh yeah that's a pretty good upgrade, I want that on my coat
[1:21:08] <%Razputin217> BONFIRE LIT
[1:21:10] <%Nobrev> I think hold r1 is sprint
[1:21:11] <DSD24> @StaceMcGate Oh don't you worry its gonna come back
[1:21:13] <DefaultSettiings> male characters are for girls
[1:21:13] <%Binary_Fireball> the fuck, this game felt liked ass when I played it
[1:21:14] <TyrianPurpleHaze> @AngriestPat The bayonet works better with mage for me than the pipe.
[1:21:16] <BallinArbiter> Really makes you feel like anime
[1:21:18] <%AncelDeLambert> I'll wait a week or more on this, it took a decent stretch of time for God Eater 3 to just roll to a stop and never live again
[1:21:22] <%Binary_Fireball> maybe they made it better
[1:21:22] <%Laecerelius> maybe get some mage gifts
[1:21:30] <$bootysteve> Shards of |, ||,||, |_
[1:21:30] <%Cthulos> These designs are rad. If you like them, check out the God Eater games zoneZT
[1:21:31] <tri3dgE027> Sure is a huge improvement from the initial PAX demo
[1:21:31] <%sirisvirus> Debating between this and Surge 2 this weekend and can't decide
[1:21:32] <%grim_abel> By Blazing Roar.
[1:21:32] <%joylent_blue> its a little slidey, little floaty, but i enjoyed what i played of it
[1:21:34] <%grim_abel> Best spell
[1:21:36] <%Shadicara> Big anime
[1:21:36] <rufus2k2> @ahdurian boy is it but with a more than veneer anime aesthetic
[1:21:50] <rufus2k2> I hope the devs keep working on this
[1:21:53] <%GarbageNirvana> Wonder how this game feels coming off of a Souls game
[1:21:53] <jackythefrost> @Binary_Fireball they changed the game a hell of a lot from the beta a year ago
[1:21:55] <$Sphincter_Spelunker> @sirisvirus This game has a shit ton of character customization
[1:21:56] <+ahdurian> @rufus2k2 thanks bb. yeah i can see it
[1:21:56] <+Clik404> @anceldelambert What do you mean?
[1:21:58] <%AncelDeLambert> then again, one of the main issues with God Eater was its shit tutorials and restricted maps
[1:22:03] <%GarbageNirvana> And like does it feel worse the fresher you are
[1:22:03] <%Animorphimagi> Story in this is without a doubt better here than in Surge 2
[1:22:03] <%Laecerelius> Now Pat can be bullshit blazing
[1:22:03] <Finakala> How did we go from no soulslikes to The Surge 2, Remnant and Code Vein within a month
[1:22:05] <FstSergeant8595> I checked into TwitchCon for a hot sec... oooof i dont recommend that cringe
[1:22:08] <SnekForce1> @sirisvirus I hear surge is the better of those
[1:22:11] <$bootysteve> |, || ||, |_ Shards
[1:22:17] <$bootysteve> crap I can't get it to do 2 lines
[1:22:21] <%UW_Duncan> @bootysteve nice
[1:22:25] <DSD24> @Finakala Dark Souls is still pretty hot right now
[1:22:32] <%mh9s> Large Lad
[1:22:33] <$drfaustisdead> Hi black knight
[1:22:34] <%Binary_Fireball> @jackythefrost that would explain it. the major complaint I had back then was the feel felt... disconnected.
[1:22:37] <Escherite> his crotch in your face
[1:22:39] <%kujofire990> go for the knees
[1:22:39] <%grim_abel> why is he using pipe
[1:22:40] <panic_rabbit> @bootysteve you tried
[1:22:41] <+Edrem> sounds like they just hinted at Sekiro DLC too
[1:22:45] <%gatoralus> The Surge 2 is actually a good ass game I'm like 10 hours in, but this game also seems cool for anime reasons lol
[1:22:45] <%Teyaric> They just took FF14's interface and applied it to a souls mage with FFT's JP system. This is AMAZING.
[1:22:48] <RaimeTT> @GarbageNirvana Probably pretty bad honestly especially if you're coming from bloodborne/sekiro
[1:22:50] <%DesuDesuDokiDoki> YEYEYEYEYEYYEE
[1:22:51] <rufus2k2> ORA
[1:22:52] <+alphonseisbest> @fstsergeant8595 what's happening over there?
[1:22:53] <Escherite> om nom nom
[1:22:57] <SomeOtherNeb> okay yeah those are cool sleeves
[1:22:57] <$drfaustisdead> Bye Black Knight
[1:22:59] <Rhonne> rekt
[1:23:04] <rufus2k2> so that's what the sleeves are for
[1:23:08] <%StaceMcGate> heresy
[1:23:10] <%UW_Duncan> that jacket is totally The Darkness
[1:23:10] <Donchalant402> why are you using the shitty pipe
[1:23:14] <%transporterthesequel> TRENCH
[1:23:14] <TyrianPurpleHaze> @AngriestPat The mage is even better if you use the bayoent instead of the shitty pipe.
[1:23:16] <%brickwall35> this looks like a mix of DS, Destiny, and FF
[1:23:16] <%DesuDesuDokiDoki> SICK
[1:23:17] <%ElenaManetta> amaging
[1:23:17] <%joylent_blue> i mean, you can play whatever you want whenever you want
[1:23:18] <Trash_leviathan> new jacket hype
[1:23:18] <$Sphincter_Spelunker> Mage has cooldowns in this game. Of course it's better
[1:23:21] <XenonViEternal> Love this veil
[1:23:22] <lotharaxe> They keep throwing equipment at you uh
[1:23:22] <DefaultSettiings> no more cool blue dash tho
[1:23:22] <%invisi_bliss> crazy talk activate
[1:23:23] <%joylent_blue> thats the mechanic
[1:23:25] <+phtevenfry> that's the best shitty pipe, sir

[1:24:33] <+CounterBeard> Man that combustion is rad
[1:24:34] <Rhonne> wait, so does all the armor give you a different weird monster thing to summon out of your back?
[1:24:37] <%ScreamLord> @AngriestPat And from what I've seen. There are different versions and designs for these jackets. SO there can be an even cooler looking Spear Coat
[1:24:39] <SomeOtherNeb> why are you killing the Shinigami from Death Note

[1:24:54] <%Remery_> you like the penetration
[1:24:54] <+Zereaux> game look good
[1:24:54] <Ks201> @angriestpat using the bloodviel attack also gives you more max mp till you rest

[1:25:14] <AzureHawk_Streams> Hey dudes! How long has the stream been going?
[1:25:14] <CrabSlacks> it's a bit long
[1:25:17] <%joylent_blue> i think you can turn it off if you want lol
[1:25:18] <%Qexec> too much time for a backstab IMO
[1:25:20] <%PatchworkSquid> correct me if I'm wrong. . . .but I think im getting this instead of the surge 2.
[1:25:22] <%DesuDesuDokiDoki> SO COOL
[1:25:22] <RaimeTT> !uptime
[1:25:23] <@Moobot> I've been playing this game for how long? Oh only 1h 25m.
[1:25:23] <%Sol_Install> you can turn it off in settings
[1:25:24] <%AncelDeLambert> this game's camera HATES my eyes and wants them dead
[1:25:24] <$Sphincter_Spelunker> that hands out pose he does before the tail comes out is so goofy LUL
[1:25:27] <stingray53_1> you can turn off the cinematic
[1:25:29] <%KitkatRai> The Flame Alchemist
[1:25:32] <%Kiiper> YOu can combo into drain attacks with R1+Square too
[1:25:32] <TomDanksEGOT> @AngriestPat It's so Tokyo Ghoul
[1:25:33] <$drfaustisdead> @AngriestPat It's also really smart to give you so much stuff to play around with this early in the game.
[1:25:34] <IndoorSitup> You can turn off the cinematic camera BTW
[1:25:35] <%ScreamLord> @AngriestPat You can use Bloodveil Attacks mid combo
[1:25:35] <%AncelDeLambert> @stingray53_1 oh thank god
[1:25:36] <Funkyfjord> is that spell just on a cooldown? no mp?
[1:25:40] <%Shadicara> Let him be cell you weebs Kappa
[1:25:40] <%PanicSwytch> Yes, the animation can be turned off
[1:25:41] <+megabassx0> bullshit blazing
[1:25:48] <+bonzosan> That tail knows the smell of the game
[1:25:48] <%bevyrage> @Funkyfjord that's the backstab animation
[1:25:50] <BallinArbiter> This game looks way better now than in the beta
[1:25:53] <+Papafleish> you forgot to equip abilities
[1:25:58] <+CaptainGrime> @megabassx0 I KNOW WHO I AM!

[1:26:02] <Finakala> Woooeeeoeooowowwww
[1:26:06] <%GarbageNirvana> So you can switch builds on the fly, huh
[1:26:07] <KoryMccool> @Funkyfjord spells use a number up in the lower right
[1:26:08] <bluebiscuit94> Fast parry
[1:26:12] <%joylent_blue> its a REALLY good parry
[1:26:12] <tmo200> The 16/16 is sorta like mp
[1:26:15] <machshop> is this dark souls
[1:26:18] <%Shadicara> Bent parry
[1:26:18] <Mrrccava> look at this awesome weeb shit.
[1:26:23] <%gatoralus> @PatchworkSquid surge 2 has better levels and combat i think, but this game has tons of builds and anime and flashy attacks soooo yeah lol
[1:26:24] <implied_consent> Adidas: eat fresh
[1:26:25] <KoryMccool> @Funkyfjord you get it back by hitting enemies
[1:26:25] <%twoto858> isn't tbis the first area?
[1:26:26] <Funkyfjord> @bevyrage i mean the big fireball he did before switching from mage oh ok thanks @KoryMccool
[1:26:27] <TyrianPurpleHaze> That's a WAY better parry than the other jacket.
[1:26:31] <%Saltmeisterr> i hear slurps
[1:26:36] <IndoorSitup> @angriestpat By the way, you can turn off the cinematic camera in the options.

[1:28:16] <RaimeTT> I never have used a homeward bone or its analogues
[1:28:16] <+Roundelay11> So far, which do you like more? Ashen, this, or Surge 2?
[1:28:26] <Apoc_666> This and Surge 2 releasing pretty much at the same time is a shame. Space out your souls like devs.

[1:31:11] <TwinBat> man I'm not a fan of this generic anime voice acting
[1:31:11] <Valdorick> "Its fine, I WON"T KILL YOU" "T-that wasn't even on my mind" "Good, because it wasn't on mine either. Lead the way."
[1:31:13] <%CherrieVelvet> that sounds like something a backstabber would say

[1:31:39] <dodgy_dingo_> there a sprint button?
[1:31:41] <stabbityrabbit> @AngriestPat Okay, so I wanna say something real quick before I go play this game myself. This game makes a pretty bad first impression, but gets better the further in you go. Once you have more weapons, codes, and veils it gets way better.
[1:31:45] <DefaultSettiings> @TyrianPurpleHaze Chris Jericho.
[1:31:47] <rufus2k2> yo I want that big boy's sword tho
[1:31:48] <ISkyHunterI> This area was so bullshit in the first demo
[1:31:48] <AzureHawk_Streams> *weeb mode on* EWWW, english voices *weeb mode off*
[1:31:50] <%StaceMcGate> @AngriestPat You seem to gravitate towards polearms in soulslike
[1:31:52] <TomDanksEGOT> If your ally ever says you can avoid an enemy, fight them immediatly it means the enemy is guarding a treasure or has a new weapon/gear
[1:31:54] <%kujofire990> A N I M E
[1:32:10] <stabbityrabbit> Not sure how he's been feeling about it, but I figured I'd say my piece now.

[1:32:12] <%Shadicara> Big and meaty
[1:32:22] <%blastazoid26> Im not sure if i should get this or the surge

[1:35:08] <%StaceMcGate> @AngriestPat what is anything? we haven't got any backstory yet
[1:35:09] <%Prism_Wing> Tentacles tri1
[1:35:09] <%gatoralus> yep
[1:35:10] <%Kiiper> It actually could
[1:35:11] <TyrianPurpleHaze> Nah, it couldn't possibly be in the God Eather universe.
[1:35:11] <$drfaustisdead> They better address why they don't just dig them up and move them?
[1:35:11] <KosOrSomeSayKosm_> yeeeah
[1:35:13] <AzureHawk_Streams> Do you plan on playing Fist of the North Star on stream?
[1:35:14] <%miguelrod777> yes
[1:35:14] <+gannondaddy> i hope
[1:35:15] <%transporterthesequel> Just secret Vampires in God Eater
[1:35:16] <BallinArbiter> Squid2 Squid4
[1:35:18] <%ScreamLord> It's Vampire Cthulhu
[1:35:18] <%machinearms> It looks like the Eldritch
[1:35:18] <stormhawk9891> Ummm... about that...
[1:35:19] <+dirtyh4rr1> wait, it isnt?
[1:35:19] <%kewlmyc> I've been hearing some stuff so probably
[1:35:20] <DefaultSettiings> Pat needs to hurry up and find the sex change coffin
[1:35:21] <suikudo> playin god eater 3 as we speak
[1:35:22] <+TinyLittleDancer> My recommendation to everybody saying "Surge 2 or this?" is to play the demo and if still stuck then maybe renting Surge 2 for a night.
[1:35:24] <%informedotaku> there's a preorder theme that has a collab with God eater so maybe
[1:35:25] <LaughingCatt> Didnt we straight up see a God Eater monster?
[1:35:27] <WeebFever> That would make it People Eater
[1:35:28] <IndoorSitup> @angriestpat This game uses the Dark Souls III system for multiplayer btw
[1:35:30] <%PanicSwytch> Is it the same Devs?
[1:35:31] <bruno_silv0> dont worrie about it
[1:35:32] <RaimeTT> yes because it's literally the same designer
[1:35:32] <+BeatH7> wait it's not?
[1:35:34] <%Saltmeisterr> what is god eater?
[1:35:37] <+Stereotreme> I mean, isn't it the same devs, same art team, same basically everyone?
[1:35:39] <RaimeTT> and devs
[1:35:39] <Marpolo13> @PanicSwytch yes
[1:35:43] <DSD24> @PanicSwytch Its the same devs
[1:35:43] <%joylent_blue> i like Luis, he's cool
[1:35:43] <%Remery_> Yea you can a God Eater x Code Vein Dynamic Theme on Ps4
[1:35:46] <darkdagon769> not gonna lie though, one of the weaknesses of the anime souls is that there's no sit and chill animation for bonfires
[1:35:46] <%solidousstream> @angriestpat hey I dont know if you know or not but you can equip the passive and active skills from the other blood codes.once youve equipped those codes at least once.
[1:35:49] <suikudo> @Saltmeisterr anime monster hunter
[1:35:53] <Laveyrin> yea, same team afteral
[1:35:55] <%Pookiedaexzile> important questiom
[1:36:00] <%Nobrev> aragami and oracle cells are a pretty widespread issue in god eater and this game doesn't match up with that very well
[1:36:00] <%Pookiedaexzile> is blade in this
[1:36:04] <garbageheaphound> What the did Twitch change its layout?
[1:36:05] <%cvp5127> think this will get a switch port

[1:49:47] <Trash_leviathan> parry tho
[1:49:49] <Rhonne> "get gud"
[1:49:49] <%ScreamLord> @AngriestPat You need blocking apparently
[1:49:49] <$rekinom> Who needs to block when you have SWORD
[1:49:51] <omen_setter> the power of friendship is not quite enough. we need tiddies too
[1:49:55] <%bread_assassin> Don't talk to Stranger like that. He's a cool guy.
[1:49:55] <+Pomer> Is Pat liking this more or less than Surge 2? kinda morbidly curious, in a sort of gossipy bitch kinda way.
[1:49:57] <%rumtumtugnutz> D34D
[1:49:58] <DSD24> @Saltmeisterr It was from a Shitstorm game
[1:49:59] <ovan20> and i thought monster hunter had big weapons LUL
[1:50:00] <Finakala> Better to block some damage than eat all of it
[1:50:01] <%informedotaku> stranger told you to study
[1:50:01] <MrDonTacos_> less damage is better than full damage
[1:50:02] <%NeroInfinite> "GOBLINS ILL LIKE FIRE AND ICE BOTH"

[1:50:04] <%StaceMcGate> @Saltmeisterr SBFP Faith
[1:50:06] <%Shadicara> Eating shit also doesn't block all damage LUL
[1:50:08] <s_snowball> blocking is for cowards

[1:50:12] <%Saltmeisterr> thought si
[1:50:12] <%AncelDeLambert> the camera shake is so AGGRESSIVE
[1:50:14] <%Saltmeisterr> so
[1:50:15] <Goldenwolf98> Oliver went from background anime boy to ugly bastard real quick Kappa
[1:50:17] <grayphoenix564> If I wanted to take chip damage like a BITCH I'd play UMVC3 online and get bullied by people playing Dr. Doom
[1:50:20] <pibbleton> Pat is basically a French leperchaun, he should play to his strengths and use magic.
[1:50:23] <rosemon5001> literally a mechanic you will have to use against some bosses nahh because of this one thing i wont use it
[1:50:24] <%informedotaku> somebody call Goblin Slayer
[1:50:24] <%DesuDesuDokiDoki> try mage

[1:58:43] <BakaSurvivah> phrasing
[1:58:43] <worldbrand> so you're saying vampire sexy multiplied by anime sexy equals this

[1:59:08] <%doc_ock_rokc> @commanderclaw apparently
[1:59:10] <Quietshun13> that was a new class
[1:59:10] <%grim_abel> The air is poisoned and makes them turn into the lost faster. @AngriestPat
[1:59:11] <TyrianPurpleHaze> The gas masks keep them from turning into monsters lik Oliver did.
[1:59:12] <%PanicSwytch> Becuz anime
[1:59:13] <%Maids4lyfe> the air is poisonous and turns you into hollows if you don't wear a mask

[2:45:24] <%Owkono> Weeaboomers
[2:45:24] <%sirisvirus> @AngriestPat trying to decide between this and surge 2 what do you suggest so far?
[2:45:25] <%rumtumtugnutz> Who the fuck is that guy
[2:45:26] <Marpolo13> no, literally only you
[2:45:31] <GeltonZ> @demegodz Destiny isn't anime enough
[2:45:32] <%arcaderabbit48> So what's the plot here?
[2:45:34] <DSD24> Yep
[2:45:37] <PolyesterKyle> i want to strap famicom controllers to my head for the post apocalypse
[2:45:42] <+nekodelic> THIS
[2:45:46] <%king_wragles> @Marpolo13 that's the joke
[2:45:50] <%connos_procrastination> my athsma
[2:45:50] <RICE02> My asthma blocks everything
[2:45:50] <%PanicSwytch> So u are Vampire Jesus
[2:45:51] <%demegodz> @GeltonZ Needs more vampire tiddies
[2:45:52] <RagingLeo> this is funnier to watch tho
[2:45:53] <majindusto> THIS
[2:45:55] <MrDonTacos_> this if you love anime TITS
[2:45:55] <+bonzosan> the chosen one
[2:45:59] <Marpolo13> @king_wragles i know
[2:46:03] <GeltonZ> @demegodz *NODS*
[2:46:05] <%cvp5127> do you like anime
[2:46:06] <%rumtumtugnutz> But this has tiddie honkers
[2:46:07] <CptHarlok> Surge is my pick
[2:46:09] <bruno_silv0> fuck the surge, bosses are terrible
[2:46:13] <Vaardvark> pssst pat say the one that gave you money
[2:46:15] <%mayorrev> PAT THE SPONSORS
[2:46:16] <Vileosis> @arcaderabbit48 we're the chosen vampire
[2:46:17] <Marpolo13> flip a coin
[2:46:18] <%joylent_blue> plus this has amazing character creation
[2:46:19] <%mortalitas87> this has tiddy though
[2:46:21] <GeltonZ> @MrDonTacos_ Alas I don't think your tits can ever get as big as the NPCs.
[2:46:22] <+nekodelic> THIS ONE
[2:46:23] <%DedlokPM> !Surge2
[2:46:26] <+Zxtole> Surge aka construction zone aesthetic
[2:46:27] <MaxXtreme23> surge has terrible bosses as opposed to mr. oliver collins...?
[2:46:28] <%Remery_> this one ha a hot spring
[2:46:30] <%connos_procrastination> god yeah the bosses are really bad in surge 2
[2:46:36] <%mh9s> icker
[2:46:40] <%connos_procrastination> like worse than the first
[2:46:42] <Fulcabre> There seems like there's a lot going on here
[2:46:44] <jackythefrost> Surge bosses are terrible
[2:46:44] <%dekkitout> Is the juicy gift his cock?
[2:46:45] <xeros720> worse or better than surge 1 bosses?
[2:46:48] <%Bad1uck> I'm surprised how good surge 2 is since surge 1 was such shit
[2:46:51] <$zackalan> Surge 2 has you cool robot, Code Vein has vampires and huge anime gazongas. The choice should be clear
[2:46:52] <ミュウレ4242> the red and black color scheme is tacky.
[2:46:55] <bruno_silv0> you mean rhe first boss of the game?
[2:46:59] <%StaceMcGate> and his name was Oliver
[2:47:01] <$megamonmon123> @dekkitout dicks are savory not juicy
[2:47:04] <CptHarlok> Having bought both, I've been eye rolling a lot in this one.
[2:47:06] <%PanicSwytch> Construction zone game or Hot Springs game
[2:47:09] <%dekkitout> Says you
[2:47:11] <Finakala> What if I want robotiddie
[2:47:13] <RupanSen> What about Remnant tho?
[2:47:23] <DSD24> Nioh's awesome!
[2:47:23] <%CalderGaming> remnant also has poor bosses
[2:47:25] <Rhonne> so you're saying wait for nioh 2
[2:47:25] <PolyesterKyle> surge 2 is bad? that's a shame, i really wish Let It Die was a substantial fleshed out single player experience instead of what it is
[2:47:25] <%KitsuneManami> @AngriestPat Nioh 2 will do it
[2:47:25] <$Sphincter_Spelunker> I don't know Bloodborne was pretty great Kappa
[2:47:26] <GeltonZ> @Finakala Wait for PSO2 I guess.
[2:47:26] <%Bad1uck> @megamonmon123 If you work them enough they turn fairly juicy
[2:47:26] <%arcaderabbit48> GHod, remember when they were talking about this game back when DS3 was released?
[2:47:28] <xeros720> yeah, is remnant a souls game or something else pat?
[2:47:30] <%mayorrev> tbh if these both had demo's i'd say Try Before You Buy
[2:47:31] <reiju_22> nioh is amazing
[2:47:34] <DSD24> Remants the best shooter version of Dark Souls
[2:47:34] <waifoong98> Play Nioh instead Kappa
[2:47:35] <CptHarlok> Nioh is definitely the best, but I see your point.
[2:47:35] <%Thalchampz> i'm hyped for nioh 2
[2:47:36] <%StaceMcGate> Sponsorship lost
[2:47:36] <xeros720> frankly, i'm probably gonna buy remnant
[2:47:42] <%mayorrev> SELLOUT
[2:47:43] <$megamonmon123> @bad1uck i see what you did there
[2:47:44] <+Roundelay11> I'm probably going to play both, but I think I'll hit Code Vein first
[2:47:46] <gustavozxd> Not gonna lie nioh is probably one of my favorite games of all time
[2:47:53] <%ScreamLord> @AngriestPat I guess only the Protag can revive Mistles and Bloodsprings. At first Luis made it seems like there are more Void-Types and that all Void-Types can do it but now he's acting like only you can.
[2:47:54] <+TinyLittleDancer> weeb
[2:48:00] <%mayorrev> SPONSOR AT RISK
[2:48:03] <gustavozxd> it ran kinda jank on the PS4
[2:48:06] <%mh9s> he's giving you the dick in installments
[2:48:09] <gustavozxd> at least the demo
[2:48:10] <RICE02> Check didnt come through
[2:48:10] <%RantingRavager> Break off a piece of that DICK-KAT BAR
[2:48:11] <GeltonZ> Hyped for Nioh 2 because they're adding custom characters.
[2:48:13] <%connos_procrastination> i finished surge 2 earlier and i honestly think i prefer surge 1 despite the quality of life stuff
[2:48:14] <%Asagi66> hows the pc ver of code vein
[2:48:14] <%StaceMcGate> They still haven't fixed Blasphemous
[2:48:14] <%miguelrod777> shill rejected
[2:48:15] <%sirisvirus> Thanks for the suggestion probably getting both eventually
[2:48:18] <%Monkeyweed21> You are a TERRIBLE shill
[2:48:32] <%mayorrev> oops there goes your influencer money
[2:48:32] <%Dr_Mooose> ok?
[2:48:32] <RupanSen> I mean, you have a fucking 2080 ti LUL
[2:48:32] <Marpolo13> assassin man
[2:48:33] <%Thalchampz> GOT GOT
[2:48:35] <+alphonseisbest> WAIT 4 NIOH 2
[2:48:37] <%ScreamLord> Get fucked!
[2:48:38] <$megamonmon123> what kinds of weapons are in this game?
[2:48:38] <Rhonne> but pat, what about the big bag of money surge 2 gave you!?
[2:48:45] <%Remery_> a lot of sneak attacks in this game xD
[2:48:47] <garbageheaphound> Holy shit Louie
[2:48:50] <Finakala> Both of these games are interesting, but DOOM Eternal is coming soon and that's my jam
[2:48:52] <%Animorphimagi> alll da weapons
[2:48:55] <PolyesterKyle> do you have to have this louis guy with you? seems kinda like it's ruining the combat
[2:48:58] <Vileosis> get ambushed LUL
[2:48:59] <bruno_silv0> the infinite builds in this game alone make it better than the surge imo
[2:49:00] <mak0t0yukii> Louis is pretty OP
[2:49:04] <%joylent_blue> PolyesterKyle you can go solo
[2:49:05] <%deviljhojho94> i seen it
[2:49:10] <Marpolo13> glass cannon loius?
[2:49:12] <%NeroInfinite> infinit builds
[2:49:12] <+aspirationdeath> Youre still playing with the training wheels on i see
[2:49:13] <%KitsuneManami> @AngriestPat Try out Mia
[2:49:13] <%rumtumtugnutz> It's either Louis or Other Bro.
[2:49:13] <%connos_procrastination> im HORNY AF for DOOM ETERNAL
[2:49:15] <waifoong98> going hard spyCappa
[2:49:16] <$megamonmon123> any guns or bows or whatever?
[2:49:17] <%transporterthesequel> Jintakun HOOOOMERUN
[2:49:19] <%Animorphimagi> you can go it alone but GOOD LUCK
[2:49:22] <TyrianPurpleHaze> Louis is the real hero of this game.
[2:49:22] <xeros720> Louis is really hard, i can't take my eyes away
[2:49:26] <%CalderGaming> gotta say the environments in this game so far aren't doing it for me
[2:49:28] <%TimetodiveLTX> what kind of souls like has music during normal encounters, is what I wanna know
[2:49:29] <%joylent_blue> megamonmon123 there are rifles yeah
[2:49:30] <PolyesterKyle> @joylent_blue thank you, good to hear
[2:49:39] <%StaceMcGate> all the environments are brown
[2:49:40] <+DingusMcFadden> I pooped a motor tentacle once
[2:49:42] <$Sphincter_Spelunker> @megamonmon123 there's rifle with bayonets. but they shoot more like a crossbow
[2:49:42] <$megamonmon123> @joylent_blue oh cool cool
[2:49:44] <Taffer85> the partner system reminds me of dragon's dogma alot
[2:49:44] <+Dragon4234> @AngriestPat but one sponsored you and the other didn't
[2:49:50] <%ScreamLord> @AngriestPat Looks like NPC companions are just as strong as the player
[2:49:54] <%KitsuneManami> @AngriestPat GOOGLE THE NPC PRESENT STUFF
[2:50:00] <Finakala> This area looks almost the same as one of the places in Remnant actually
[2:50:01] <%rumtumtugnutz> They're pretty postie animu
[2:50:04] <IndoorSitup> They get better later in the gamr
[2:50:05] <%Animorphimagi> actually the next two locations look METALL AF
[2:50:07] <IndoorSitup> game
[2:50:09] <+bonzosan> don't worry there is the color purple in this game
[2:50:12] <%NeroInfinite> Surge 2 has varied gear and enviroments, while this game jsut has infinite options
[2:50:14] <$megamonmon123> I wish there was a dark souls like game that made ranged weapons awesome looking to use
[2:50:19] <kammerdood> Best souls game since Bloodborne to be honest
[2:50:26] <$megamonmon123> like stylish
[2:50:28] <%Piemen99> oh hey anime dark souls
[2:50:32] <laguerrilha> Was Ashen bad? Is this the best recent Souls alternative?
[2:50:33] <+sixcubit> Looks just like SOnic '06
[2:50:38] <Finakala> Best Souls game since Bloodborne was The Old Hunters :>
[2:50:43] <$rottingcrawler> Cheer100 Oh thank god, one of the few streamers not playing a chick. Can't wait for the hype once he get's the atlas blood code.
[2:50:46] <%KitsuneManami> @AngriestPat Google the Item Gifting to NPCs so you dont give them the wrong items
[2:51:00] <%Dr_Mooose> those I frames
[2:51:09] <+sixcubit> this game seems REALLY easy
[2:51:11] <%Dr_Mooose> *iframes
[2:51:13] <+moranprime> I wish my fat rolls had I frames like that
[2:51:14] <%SilverSFS> Pat you must smash all boxes they hide items in them.
[2:51:20] <Marpolo13> wut
[2:51:22] <+Zxtole> The game is easy mode with companions, but is probably still easier than souls games
[2:51:29] <%Shadicara> Course it does its the start LUL
[2:51:29] <+DingusMcFadden> Is there any knowledge that Pat does not currently possess ?
[2:51:35] <ミュウレ4242> i wouldn't call an easy game a soulslike.
[2:51:39] <%Bad1uck> @megamonmon123 sadly the only game I've seen recently with stylish ranged attacks is machinists in FF14
[2:51:42] <%transporterthesequel> Vampires man, immortal
[2:51:51] <waifoong98> looks like that bridge map in GE2
[2:51:52] <+Zxtole> Souls games had summons in them that would trivialize the game as well
[2:51:55] <worldbrand> in the game or in real life?
[2:52:07] <%joylent_blue> pat knows all
[2:52:11] <a_mad_dragon> pat does not posess the knowledge of how to stop Crazy Talk
[2:52:12] <%Arrotal> Arrotal subscribed with Twitch Prime. 
[2:52:14] <%Animorphimagi> this has more style and most souls games
[2:52:16] <Marpolo13> oh

[2:52:38] <CptHarlok> Can't see this as a Souls game to be honest. Standard actionRPG for the most part thus far.

[2:52:40] <xeros720> by louis, he wasn't hard enough
[2:52:45] <%Shadicara> Bye louis

[2:52:54] <leroypi> I just played the demo and I got to say I’m a big fan of how magic and range weapons. Between the demo and this stream I’m actually thinking about getting the game.

[2:53:08] <bruno_silv0> also people tend to forget and to be fair rightfully so since ds1 was their first, that game is not that hard
[2:53:08] <%Dr_Mooose> duel wield hammers
[2:53:11] <%AgentOrangeShoes> apatBig SPIKIES
[2:53:12] <karl_rex> Did Louis just die?
[2:53:13] <Rhonne> lol
[2:53:15] <%roundaboutrevengeance> TOO MUCH
[2:53:15] <majindusto> COOL HAMMERS
[2:53:16] <%griffball13> looks like the evil within safe man hammer
[2:53:21] <+DingusMcFadden> Stop giving me cool hammers, you guys! TearGlove
[2:53:24] <%Zaphire_Saucypants> yeah but you upgraded it twice.
[2:53:28] <ミュウレ4242> can you dual weild hammers?
[2:53:30] <Taffer85> I can't believe Loius is dead for the rest of the game
[2:53:31] <IndoorSitup> Louis can be revived at Mistles.
[2:53:32] <$rottingcrawler> Waiting for pat to shoot out a distress signal once he reaches boss so i can get in on that >:3
[2:53:35] <Rhonne> oh he's fine
[2:53:36] <%Big_Dream> No duel wielding the anime has failed me
[2:53:36] <$Sphincter_Spelunker> my brand is tingling
[2:53:38] <Vileosis> don't worry NPCs don't die
[2:53:38] <%TimetodiveLTX> Chalice Dungeons? Miasma? is this a Crystal Chronicles reference

[2:55:26] <shadowmaksim> @AngriestPat You can get it. You have to give presents to Yakumo for points and exchange those for it from him.
[2:55:28] <%patriotrenegade> @AngriestPat Are you ever going to go back to Remnant?
[2:55:28] <cosmicgoatee> KappaPride

[2:55:32] <%Bad1uck> @spydurman *nods in agreement*
[2:55:33] <%Big_Dream> @AngriestPat btw pat after using so trickery fuckery the max lvl is 300
[2:55:34] <%Saltmeisterr> why does pat have a constant urge to eat dicks
[2:55:40] <waifoong98> Ah so this game has affection system like Toukiden to get NPC weapons huh
[2:55:41] <laguerrilha> @Spydurman but dont you want a bland protagonist that you can self insert instead of an interesting one? Kappa
[2:55:46] <PolyesterKyle> is the game really so brown? most of the environments are similar to this?
[2:55:48] <%Remery_> @Saltmeisterr cuz he's a slut
[2:55:54] <Cherokia666> "I'm gonna eat his dick" - Patrick 2019
[2:55:58] <%transporterthesequel> oh he come bak
[2:56:02] <%rumtumtugnutz> hose off them taters
[2:56:03] <+DingusMcFadden> If you ever meat Pat in irl, don\t offer him your dick, chat. He may eat it.
[2:56:04] <%Dr_Mooose> only 300
[2:56:05] <+Zxtole> No, just the first area is brown and dusty
[2:56:07] <%joylent_blue> pat does talk a lot about sucking dicks
[2:56:11] <%joylent_blue> its relatable tho
[2:56:13] <+LodestarMage> Can I get a recap of what the background setting of this game is.
[2:56:17] <+alphonseisbest> @dingusmcfadden it does SOUND nice, it just doesn't work with oooooooverly animated motions of these anime characters
[2:56:18] <tmo200> There is an ice, fire, and desert area i saw
[2:56:20] <Rhonne> pat next week: "So I grinded out to level 300..."
[2:56:22] <CrmznOgre> the enemies are looking kinda meh so far.
[2:56:23] <%MoraMiarty> that crate breaking sound is super flaccid
[2:56:23] <Marpolo13> if only I had a BIG ASS weapon that might open it Kappa
[2:56:26] <%ginger__gaming__> Man those crates are so unsatisfying to hit
[2:56:28] <garbageheaphound> the box desrtuction could be improved
[2:56:30] <PolyesterKyle> @Zxtole gotcha, looking forward to seeing more
[2:56:31] <toahmes> Has he messed with the gestures yet?
[2:56:31] <%StaceMcGate> Thank you Socialism
[2:56:33] <IndoorSitup> @lodestarmage Vampire apocalypse.
[2:56:35] <%Bad1uck> @saltmeisterr Honestly is say his urge for dicks cums and goes
[2:56:39] <+LodestarMage> Ok
[2:56:42] <$rottingcrawler> So i noticed pat is still using first boss hammer, shame he hasn't discovered that great swords are better UwU
[2:56:44] <%Bad1uck> I'd*
[2:56:51] <MasterCosmic> No fall damage
[2:56:51] <%transporterthesequel> Oh that's a good ladder side
[2:56:52] <poweredscoot> cool guys don't use ladders
[2:56:52] <%Dr_Mooose> Louis is so cool
[2:56:54] <bruno_silv0> shit's fucked ft vampires, thats the situation
[2:56:54] <garbageheaphound> WOW GET FUCKED

[2:57:02] <Marpolo13> doggos
[2:57:09] <%Thalchampz> doggo time
[2:57:10] <%Remery_> @Bad1uck It flares up like Paige's Lupus
[2:57:10] <%StaceMcGate> dog moles?
[2:57:10] <+Zxtole> You can always tell a souls like because of the dog enemies
[2:57:12] <+DingusMcFadden> I think it adds to the surreal atmosphere, @alphonseisbest . Like a nightmare.
[2:57:16] <xeros720> those doggos got iframes
[2:57:23] <WeebFever> Dog vampires
[2:57:25] <%joylent_blue> its kinda shit, louis
[2:57:26] <%transporterthesequel> Louis will Vergil them as he pleases
[2:57:26] <xeros720> elmo needs iframes
[2:57:30] <%joylent_blue> nice
[2:57:35] <CptHarlok> Louis kept stealing my blood point (or whatever the fuck they're called) kills.
[2:57:40] <+Dragon4234> @LodestarMage Shit got fucked up so we fucked up our dead bodies to unfuck the shit but that shit went crazy busted and now humans are locked away and everuubody is lowing going crazy
[2:57:41] <Allroc> Louis is super OP early but falls off later because he dies so easy and you just want your partner alive as a resbot
[2:57:44] <+Tarage> You are crazy Pat.
[2:57:45] <+DingusMcFadden> You crazy, Patrick
[2:57:46] <$rottingcrawler> @Zxtole dog mobs in souls games are the worst UwU
[2:57:48] <%Dr_Mooose> textures too bright
[2:57:54] <%Animorphimagi> can't wait for the next boss. It's SO GOOD
[2:58:01] <%StaceMcGate> .... I kinda want this game now
[2:58:06] <$Dakuu75> anytime Pat says "I'm not crazy" a baby jesus gets his wings
[2:58:13] <PolyesterKyle> never try to solve problems
[2:58:13] <%Remery_> @Allroc Not when you have Yakumo that guy always staggering the boss
[2:58:17] <Marpolo13> it means you BIG fucked up and that makes it funny
[2:58:19] <%joylent_blue> play the game for him, louis
[2:58:21] <Finakala> Made the problem much worse, says Pat eating shit super hard
[2:58:27] <%Dr_Mooose> ow
[2:58:29] <+DingusMcFadden> Pat like anime: CONFIRMED @Top10AnimeBetrayals
[2:58:33] <jackythefrost> TAG TEAM
[2:58:33] <xeros720> hmm, can you juggle enemies?
[2:58:34] <%TimetodiveLTX> OH WE GOT JUGGLES?
[2:58:38] <$rottingcrawler> @Animorphimagi Literally the only boss i've struggled with in the game so far. Had to cheese it with a boring caster build.
[2:58:39] <%axellogic> I am here now
[2:58:48] <Allroc> @remery_ Yeah Yakumo is tankier and Mia stays at range most of the time
[2:58:49] <%TimetodiveLTX> i'm paying attention
[2:58:51] <%axellogic> Surprised he's using the hammer and not the greatsword
[2:58:52] <IndoorSitup> @angriestpat The S is silent, you jag.
[2:58:55] <%InugamiTheHound> sup pat I finally made it to the stream. I had to two different shifts for wendy's(two different locations)
[2:59:01] <+Fenrir_TSS> @AngriestPat is louis best girl yet?
[2:59:03] <%joylent_blue> xeros720 there are abilities that kinda... launched enemies, but i woudn't say you can juggle them
[2:59:03] <+moranprime> Louis being overly cautious for no raison LUL
[2:59:04] <toahmes> Hey Pat double click the left stick
[2:59:05] <3xgilly> Is there a way to play solo
[2:59:06] <%ScreamLord> @AngriestPat Like Gurren Lagann where beating the Spiral King and repopulating the Earth made super aliens comes down to fuck there shit up
[2:59:07] <+JacktheMan18> LUL
[2:59:09] <+DingusMcFadden> I think I'mma poop a body horror
[2:59:09] <%deviljhojho94> Very cool louis, thank you
[2:59:15] <+JavaManJoJo> you should attack them all at once because then Louis has to do all the work while you sit back
[2:59:16] <+Robopengy> is this game just future Blood: The Last Vampire?
[2:59:17] <Marpolo13> Good think Louis is a glass cannon so he just fucking destroys everything for you lol
[2:59:21] <worldbrand> oh

[2:59:31] <%Animorphimagi> I think this game encourages you to get overpowered

[2:59:32] <alwayspronking> PogChamp PogChamp
[2:59:34] <%jeffishype> is that like just one panel of the comic?

[2:59:56] <%AbnormalVoid> Not Kevin! D:
[3:00:00] <+DingusMcFadden> Kevin thinks he\s so cool just cause he has blood.
[3:00:00] <jackythefrost> @AngriestPat Hunter is fucking sick if you like using gund
[3:00:01] <toahmes> You can even set voice lines to the gestures
[3:00:03] <Professor_Rakor> I just hope it's not Chris's blood.
[3:00:03] <%StaceMcGate> does this game have invaders?
[3:00:06] <xeros720> do like how the music kicks in

[3:00:38] <%InugamiTheHound> where's chris blood?
[3:00:41] <+moranprime> Ambush sighted
[3:00:45] <%joylent_blue> LUL the idea of enemies peaking out behind cover is hilarious
[3:00:46] <+DingusMcFadden> Ke:Vein
[3:00:49] <%Saltmeisterr> i was so indifferent to this game before but it seems alright
[3:00:56] <+alibaba1101> Kevin was our old partner ya knoww
[3:01:00] <%StaceMcGate> @rottingcrawler thanks, so only multiplayer aspect is coop
[3:01:00] <CptHarlok> @AngriestPat So, seems like Monster Hunter for edgelords so far.
[3:01:00] <$Dakuu75> I thought that was Vampire IT for a sec
[3:01:03] <PolyesterKyle> hey man, why you attacking all of them at once, louis said no
[3:01:05] <%Jolnir> apatGoblin
[3:01:09] <+PerrinIsDead> Chad blood

[3:01:25] <+mugwugsampoo> xqcLeather
[3:01:30] <Doc1790> I could see the inside of his brain
[3:01:32] <CptHarlok> Eh, made by the same folks.
[3:01:34] <Tucker0603> God eater is the mon hun
[3:01:34] <%joylent_blue> very different
[3:01:38] <$rottingcrawler> @StaceMcGate pretty much. But there are always patches and updates to look forward to.
[3:01:47] <%ginger__gaming__> in what way is this mon hun?
[3:01:55] <%Remery_> Love the God Eater multiplayer of 8 players fucking up a boss
[3:01:58] <%joylent_blue> big weapons i guess
[3:02:08] <PolyesterKyle> it's anime and you have a big weapon
[3:02:08] <+gwanzan> I thought it was pronounced "bard-i-shey"
[3:02:10] <+nekodelic> ITEM
[3:02:11] <Vileosis> nothing like monster hunter
[3:02:12] <jackythefrost> God Eater is terrible, this is actually good
[3:02:13] <Manjove> ITEM MISS
[3:02:17] <cielrayze> in mh instead of fighting dank zombies you fight pink dragons that do backflips
[3:02:18] <%dekkitout> "It third person with big weapon, therefore MonHun tajPF "
[3:02:21] <Nina96> is god eater any good? @AngriestPat
[3:02:22] <+DingusMcFadden> What if: Dark Souls was produced by Hot Topic?
[3:02:24] <WeebFever> Dogs are hard to parry
[3:02:26] <%Keyd00d> apatJpeg
[3:02:29] <Finakala> It's Bard eeshe
[3:02:37] <%joylent_blue> MONKEYS WITH SWORDS
[3:02:39] <+Robopengy> So do you always have a companion?
[3:02:42] <%Jolnir> dont forget to use your musuo
[3:02:43] <+comfyman12> @AngriestPat If you hold RB you get a new X and Y move if you stand still
[3:02:47] <%joylent_blue> Robopengy you can go solo if you want

[3:03:03] <+Zxtole> No you can dismiss your companion and play alone
[3:03:06] <jackythefrost> @Nina96 God Eater is just MonHun but the weapons feel like tin foil and is 10 times more clunky
[3:03:16] <$rottingcrawler> He's about to approach the big bitch >:3!
[3:03:23] <+DingusMcFadden> Jesus, I dunno dude. Yer the one who loves cocoons so much.

[3:04:08] <+Tokanova> is this loss?
[3:04:08] <$Dakuu75> that animation feels way too long

[3:04:57] <%connos_procrastination> THE LEGENDARY FRAME WALKER
[3:04:59] <+DingusMcFadden> This game or Darksiders 3 @AngriestPat ?
[3:05:04] <$rottingcrawler> @primax104 deadass looked at frames, and got trapped x'D
[3:05:15] <tri3dgE027> Imagine having a world that runs in 60 FPS only to have this just one individual run in 5-10 FPS
[3:05:19] <xeros720> some kind of gun?
[3:05:21] <waifoong98> G-X-H

[3:06:05] <+Zxtole> Stats is class + armor
[3:06:17] <%joylent_blue> COOL
[3:06:18] <jackythefrost> @Vileosis Its faster cause the weapons feel like tin foil with no weight at all. Speed isnt everything cause in God Eaters case it make playing it feel awful
[3:06:24] <XenonViEternal> F A V O R I T E V E I L
[3:06:24] <%joylent_blue> ALSO COOL
[3:06:24] <Marpolo13> WTF

[3:06:42] <Finakala> Kekekekekeke
[3:06:47] <+Nohamforsam> thats a huge door
[3:06:49] <+alibaba1101> wtf those doors are weirdly proportioned
[3:06:49] <+ThunderZebraKing> This is some good anime bullshit
[3:06:53] <%roundaboutrevengeance> Shortcut
[3:06:54] <xeros720> powerful vampire wielding massive weapon, defeated by door

[3:07:00] <+DingusMcFadden> QueenSlayer what I call my dick, ya'll! barrYe
[3:07:04] <bluebiscuit94> Its 5:30 am here, goodnight people
[3:07:05] <+moranprime> I love me Nier spikes
[3:07:06] <cielrayze> wait thats just regular door, bust it with your vampire robe
[3:07:08] <%Tearonex> christ I might have to get this game now....
[3:07:09] <tri3dgE027> Is that how you open doors? Turn the handle and just roll back-down to safety before it opens? xzeroLUL LUL xzeroLUL
[3:07:10] <%StaceMcGate> @AngriestPat what does level up do then?
[3:07:13] <Vileosis> fufufufufu
[3:07:19] <%Monkeyweed21> LOOK AT HUNTER
[3:07:27] <%ginger__gaming__> apatElmo
[3:07:34] <+DingusMcFadden> !pokeEmlo
[3:07:36] <karl_rex> So what's with the body horror spine tail?
[3:07:49] <PolyesterKyle> you don't allocate points in this?
[3:07:51] <%joylent_blue> karl_rex its cool looking pvpSass
[3:07:52] <Vileosis> he said to look at the memory shit
[3:07:54] <+alibaba1101> so CLASSES are builds and where variability comes in in this?
[3:08:07] <%StaceMcGate> FRAMEs
[3:08:10] <%joylent_blue> PolyesterKyle no, stats change according to class equipped
[3:08:14] <Finakala> You got selectable traits and abilities too
[3:08:17] <+Zxtole> Console ports LUL
[3:08:18] <+ThunderZebraKing> So what is this, like, dark souls but with an injection of devil may cry?
[3:08:18] <Marpolo13> A pose
[3:08:22] <$rottingcrawler> @alibaba1101 A part of it yeah.
[3:08:29] <%Scottigecko> but is this coming to the vita
[3:08:30] <$Dakuu75> it's like staring into the sun... while it's running 2 frames a second
[3:08:37] <xeros720> i think the variability comes from the large amount of classes you unlock
[3:08:37] <%joylent_blue> i would not compare this to dmc at all
[3:08:40] <$Sphincter_Spelunker> @Zxtole this is pc, guy
[3:08:55] <+DingusMcFadden> It means he's rad. Invite him to parties
[3:08:56] <%kiiiirsten> Henlo I am just now tuning into this stream and it looks like a apatBig apatBig dark soul
[3:08:57] <IndoorSitup> @thunderzebraking Anime Dark Souls with vampires.
[3:09:08] <%gatoralus> it helps when the areas are pretty samey
[3:09:09] <%Dr_Mooose> ain't special no more
[3:09:11] <+Cavumentum> @AngriestPat just got here, why are you The Scorpion
[3:09:13] <%Thalchampz> leezard
[3:09:14] <jackythefrost> @alibaba1101 The minmaxing comes from the fact that maxing out abilities makes them universal, so you can use them with any class
[3:09:16] <%Thalchampz> those are hunters
[3:09:18] <+Zxtole> @Sphincter_Spelunker What do you think "port" means? I'm referring to how it's use a console limitation that carried over to PC
[3:09:23] <stingray53_1> variability comes from what weapons/blood veils you upgrade
[3:09:23] <raveous> why does the look of this game remind me of DS2
[3:09:27] <+nekodelic> ITEM
[3:09:28] <the_createy> what about lore in the game?
[3:09:33] <connorussell> makes sense
[3:09:35] <%kiiiirsten> Yes...YES....FIGHT in the chat...battle, my minions...
[3:09:39] <PolyesterKyle> i didn't know how it is
[3:09:45] <%CalderGaming> lol
[3:09:45] <+VashyronM> You bite people with your ass stinger?
[3:09:48] <%kiiiirsten> This is a HUGE dark soul 2
[3:09:52] <xeros720> yup
[3:09:54] <+bonzosan> DS2 has the big chunk in its art style
[3:09:54] <%StaceMcGate> @AngriestPat Do we know why everyone is vampires and who this queenis?
[3:09:59] <$rottingcrawler> @Cavumentum It's kinda the only viable early game strength blood veil you have access to.
[3:10:00] <IndoorSitup> Scorpion tail comes from his coat.
[3:10:01] <+ThunderZebraKing> This level design reminds me of remnant
[3:10:02] <$Sphincter_Spelunker> @Zxtole sorry I didn't immediately get that from your one word.
[3:10:02] <%joylent_blue> the lore is that the world is FUCKED, and there's vampires i guess
[3:10:04] <xeros720> as much as we shit on dark souls 2, it was fun at the time
[3:10:09] <+DingusMcFadden> Oooh sick fair judgement!
[3:10:15] <$Dakuu75> I'm not a fan of these giant albino looking rats
[3:10:20] <stingray53_1> variability also comes from what skills you bother to unlock
[3:10:23] <xeros720> BIG MAMA
[3:10:25] <karl_rex> The chad undead vs the virgin vampire
[3:10:29] <jackythefrost> I shit on DS2 cause the only good boss in that game was Fume Knight
[3:10:29] <$rottingcrawler> BIG BEECH
[3:10:31] <%Remery_> Big Momma
[3:10:32] <Vileosis> @stacemcgate no
[3:10:32] <poweredscoot> BIG WOMAN
[3:10:34] <%Hilleltaco> apatCaw
[3:10:36] <+Tarage> Hey it's Pat's mom again.
[3:10:36] <+ThunderZebraKing> Insert obligatory THICC joke here
[3:10:38] <chowdah101> enemy BBW
[3:10:38] <+Robopengy> Nice tatters
[3:10:39] <RupanSen> ok slow down, DS2 level design might be bad for a Souls but it's still miles above this
[3:10:39] <tri3dgE027> Dark Souls 2 issue is that the way your character moves feels weightless
[3:10:40] <gustavozxd> calebW
[3:10:41] <Finakala> Looks like the tracking isn't quite as absurd as DS2 tho
[3:10:41] <+moranprime> No dying this time Louis LUL
[3:10:42] <+chrishnaw> JIGGLE PHYSICS
[3:10:44] <connorussell> she got them jiggle physics

[3:10:54] <+alibaba1101> DS2 always felt like i was a cool character in a lame world
[3:10:55] <+Zxtole> @Sphincter_Spelunker I'd recommend asking people to clarify if you don't understand instead of going immediately to correction
[3:10:55] <$Dakuu75> damn, she's THIC with 5 C's
[3:11:00] <Finakala> Still got jank hitboxes though
[3:11:04] <%Hilleltaco> PogChamp

[3:11:08] <raveous> wow yeah those really be some anime titties
[3:11:09] <suikudo> Nah she aint THiccccc she PHAT
[3:11:13] <%gatoralus> @AngriestPat it seems like the attacks don't have much reach in general, does it feel that way?
[3:11:14] <+DingusMcFadden> This game kinda reminds me of Apocalypse Zero. Anyone? Apocalypse Zero?
[3:11:17] <$Sphincter_Spelunker> @Zxtole hey alright
[3:11:20] <the_createy> i just saw greatsword move from MHW///
[3:11:21] <IndoorSitup> Louis is pretty good huh?

[3:11:30] <%connos_procrastination> you can do a launcher finisher in focus mode but i forget how
[3:11:32] <$rottingcrawler> Starting to wonder how many times the anime dark souls joke is gonna be made tonight.
[3:11:37] <+moranprime> @DingusMcFadden I get that reference <3
[3:12:00] <raveous> all in all tho, how is the game for everybody?
[3:12:00] <+LowHighKang> Does the combat seem responsive. Or does it feel laggy?
[3:12:04] <%CrypticMochi> It’s nuts how powerful your companion is
[3:12:09] <$rottingcrawler> @IndoorSitup Nah.yakumo is best companion/daddy
[3:12:09] <+Zxtole> @rottingcrawler People love their unfunny anime jokes

[3:21:37] <+creamandsugar> if you don't have to eat, does that mean you don't have to go to the restroom anymore? Wouldn't he just bloat up with rotting food inside him over time?
[3:21:38] <fusedforms> you can tell you're supposed to be moved because of the music

[3:22:02] <$rottingcrawler> @creamandsugar Ayo legit questions.
[3:22:02] <%Keyd00d> people just say edgy like they just say anime at everything
[3:22:05] <CoryFTWs> I did an
[3:22:05] <RogerPoore> @AngriestPat Reminder that the creators said it's not anime
[3:22:06] <xeros720> i eat onigiri, therefore i anime
[3:22:07] <%Keyd00d> no real meaning

[3:22:12] <Marpolo13> @yoshkosh20 i mean he did say it tastes bad, so maybe it does
[3:22:13] <%kiiiirsten> Just die it's the only way to win
[3:22:17] <GeltonZ> ...the Onigiri is moldy, isn't it. That's why it tastes bad. You've been carrying that same rice ball with you for 3 YEARS!

[3:23:13] <%InugamiTheHound> @AngriestPat would you recommend this game as someone first "dark souls" like video game?
[3:23:14] <%rumtumtugnutz> They did not succeed
[3:23:14] <%Thalchampz> SOCIAL LINK, GO!
[3:23:14] <Finakala> That's like saying Devil May Cry isn't anime, when it's the most anime thing to exist

[3:23:16] <%TimetodiveLTX> HONTO NO KOTO SAAA
[3:23:17] <VAKR> We couldn't handle the anime if they didn't tone it down.
[3:23:18] <+Dre_> if this is toned down i wonder what it was before
[3:23:20] <RollCritFail> "We wanted to done down the anime, but we decided to tone it up instead"
[3:23:26] <%Remery_> @AngriestPat IF you deepen your relationship they will come to the hot spring with you

[3:23:43] <$rottingcrawler> Anyways i'm off because i thought he'd hit butterfly boss next and get stuck because he wouldn't switch into caster. Therefore i could snips his distress signal.
[3:23:44] <+yoshkosh20> time to make them love you with material objects.
[3:23:46] <%ScreamLord> @AngriestPat Right, and Bayonetta isn't a Character Action game

[3:23:50] <Koosahmii> Guys stop making me laugh my neighbors are sleeping
[3:23:52] <CptHarlok> It does blow my mind that they said they "Toned down" the anime-ness of it for western release. Like, what the fuck was it before-hand?

[3:25:05] <+Freelance7> No it's literal. The parasite on your heart keeps you from dying
[3:25:07] <$Dakuu75> "never die" and "sacrifice" in the same speech... kinda conflicts
[3:25:07] <+chrishnaw> Never die != sacrifice
[3:25:15] <%noobpsyboticus> this game is actually pretty fucking rad gotta say
[3:25:15] <DSD24> @CptHarlok It helps that the devs are nerfing shit all the time and keep making improvements

[3:25:58] <%ScreamLord> @AngriestPat That's actually how it works for Revenant. As long as the Parasite in your heart is undamaged you'll eventually revive every time
[3:26:02] <MicrotonalMatt> This is the most bargain basement shounen villainy
[3:26:03] <%Thalchampz> this is super anime
[3:26:05] <$rottingcrawler> @kewlmyc No u :3
[3:26:06] <%InugamiTheHound> is kevin alive or dead?
[3:26:08] <VAKR> This is toned down.
[3:26:10] <%griffball13> i wonder how long a blood bead lasts for someone
[3:26:11] <+moranprime> Japan, never tone down the anime. Embrace it!
[3:26:14] <%joylent_blue> kevin is very dead
[3:26:14] <%roundaboutrevengeance> TURN IT UP
[3:26:17] <+ThunderZebraKing> try to tone it down and it just anime's even HARDER
[3:26:19] <$Dakuu75> I'm not seeing the anime
[3:26:19] <%Zaphire_Saucypants> if we're viewing this, Kevin be dead.
[3:26:22] <Finakala> Last time they 'toned down the anime' we ended up with DmC
[3:26:23] <IndoorSitup> I doubt that quote was real.
[3:26:23] <Manjove> JACKET OFF
[3:26:27] <GrandMazterNelson> Pog
[3:26:27] <%rumtumtugnutz> this is more anime than God Eater was.
[3:26:27] <%TimetodiveLTX> turn the anime down i'm trying to sleep
[3:26:27] <$Sphincter_Spelunker> did she take off more clothes
[3:26:27] <DSD24> Io where's your jacket
[3:26:28] <%connos_procrastination> TITTY
[3:26:28] <%kewlmyc> The creator said in an interview that compared to God Eater, they aimed for less typical anime designs
[3:26:30] <%dekkitout> Uh- Is Louis a Frampt or a Kaathe?
[3:26:31] <xeros720> the game was willed into existence from an effigy of burning Shonen Jumps
[3:26:31] <Ominnous> look at that toned down anime chest
[3:26:31] <Tucker0603> have you played God eater 3 @angriestpat
[3:26:31] <%VanaSkiller> this isn't even its final form atpRtsd4
[3:26:32] <Graxe_> Look how much it was toned down right there
[3:26:36] <%depressed_skeleton> side tiddy

[3:26:44] <+chrishnaw> Just cross Azumanga with Dark Souls
[3:26:44] <+HellCopter> so it won't catch fire
[3:26:44] <VAKR> Normal humans could not handle the anime that's why it was delayed a year.
[3:26:45] <%connos_procrastination> SHES GETTING NAKEDER
[3:26:45] <%Dr_Mooose> just for this shot
[3:26:45] <%Zaphire_Saucypants> side boob

[3:26:55] <%Keyd00d> The Journalist Repellant Tits
[3:26:56] <+shaderichter_belmont> she took her coat off so we could see the plot
[3:26:56] <+chrishnaw> side boob/10
[3:26:59] <%Thalchampz> the MOST anime dialogue
[3:27:01] <babo____> PAT YOUR HEAD IS BLOCKING THE BOOB

[3:27:03] <CptHarlok> @DSD24 I really liked the original Darksiders crew, so I'm glad they followed through with a lot of their promises about the game.
[3:27:04] <+applefibs> he has diamond patterning on the inside of his shirt just so he can roll up the sleeves
[3:27:04] <DoctorPhilsJazzBand> stop blocking side boob
[3:27:06] <Hellarussian> its part of the coat lore

[3:27:15] <%Zombrocom> So Louis is the real protagonist, got it
[3:27:16] <%dekkitout> Maybe her coat caught fire from the candles- she did say it was warm earlier
[3:27:21] <%merylinspants> I love this anime music
[3:27:23] <IndoorSitup> JUST LOOKED IT UP: They meant to make it less like typical anime compared to God Eater.
[3:27:23] <%SilverSFS> @AngriestPat His coat is his Blood Veil. No one wears their Blood Veil in the base.
[3:27:32] <+chrishnaw> She looks a little like Kaine from Nier

[3:28:42] <karl_rex> They're really just having her just wear bandages
[3:28:43] <MicrotonalMatt> They made it less anime by changing the names to American jobber names

[3:29:25] <%StaceMcGate> @AngriestPat whose boobs are sillier, Pyra or Io?

[3:29:31] <MicrotonalMatt> Vast expanses of backstory stored in the tiddies
[3:29:33] <+applefibs> why does Kevin keep saying Lewis wrong?
[3:29:46] <+moranprime> "Someone in the castle must be the Night's Champion, but who?"
[3:29:51] <%InugamiTheHound> this reminds me of that plot point from fallout 4. You dove into the bad guy's brain to get memories
[3:29:52] <FaytLeingodz> aleksFeels
[3:30:00] <%PatIsMyHero> This dimension sucks

[3:30:03] <$Sphincter_Spelunker> @applefibs if kevin is saying it wrong, louis said his own name wrong too
[3:30:05] <$rottingcrawler> @StaceMcGate Pyra by far. This game might be edgy af, but the xeno2 fan service is doing the most.
[3:30:09] <Manjove> ded

[3:30:13] <%hussdogrob> @dekkitout the swing and the ramen shop

[3:36:16] <zeif00> i feel like the camera is a smidge too close
[3:36:20] <%Remery_> Do it for Kevin!
[3:36:26] <%ScreamLord> @CptHarlok Hopefully VtMBL2 will live up to the first game
[3:36:29] <%WackyGear> @AngriestPat can you get bigger hammer
[3:36:30] <%rumtumtugnutz> BWA VEH
[3:36:32] <CptHarlok> You can literally waltz around and backstab nearly everyone in this game.
[3:36:35] <DSD24> More weapons should have a Kirkhammer type
[3:36:36] <%StaceMcGate> what kind of Vampire name is Kevin
[3:36:39] <StromkoPenguin> This may be less Anime Dark Souls and more just grim dark action JRPG
[3:36:40] <%roundaboutrevengeance> wut
[3:36:45] <%gatoralus> hey chat apparently this game is easy but then can be harder without a companion, can confirm?
[3:36:50] <Dakuu75> lol
[3:36:51] <%cvp5127> who
[3:36:52] <jackythefrost> Yes
[3:36:54] <%Keyd00d> LUL

[3:37:06] <%Dr_Mooose> the people like the smelly pp
[3:37:06] <%rumtumtugnutz> HA
[3:37:07] <%tragicjohnson84> Pat always opts for the big ass weapons
[3:37:09] <Solidus_113> It's not just you, there's like a dozen other streamers with more views
[3:37:19] <IndoorSitup> And they see someone in chat spamming the same shit like 10 times lol
[3:37:19] <%Ixiah> Can you get a catgirl as partner ? Kappa
[3:37:23] <%Jack_of_No_Trades> Thats why you are the Influencer and they just make games.
[3:37:23] <Dakuu75> "I don't understand anmything these days, lol"
[3:37:28] <Marpolo13> good thing you and Louis destroy everything
[3:37:31] <jackythefrost> This hame throws enemies at you so without the AI partners its really tough
[3:37:37] <%rumtumtugnutz> good thing they'reFUCKIN SCRUBS
[3:37:37] <jackythefrost> *game

[3:38:00] <$Sphincter_Spelunker> I don't think many people would watch the official channel on the release day. maybe before
[3:38:01] <TonberryLives> THIS IS THE CONTENT WE DEMAND
[3:38:02] <%Keyd00d> JUST now?
[3:38:03] <aparadoxicalbanana> does this game have invasion mechanics?
[3:38:04] <%firehawk_420> Ah interesting that wasn’t even a link
[3:38:07] <%transporterthesequel> Oh there's a PERCENTAGE
[3:38:07] <+chrishnaw> You unlocked it at the last bonfire
[3:38:12] <Manjove> why is there a percentage at the top right?
[3:38:16] <+nekodelic> @AngriestPat are you sure you did go all the way upstairs?
[3:38:21] <+Byleana> Several hours in, Pat discovers the map constantly staring him in the face
[3:38:22] <jorniev> did pat play untitled goose?
[3:38:29] <%Maids4lyfe> @aparadoxicalbanana no there is no pvp either
[3:38:32] <CaptainFrankincense> map percentage i think

[3:39:10] <GrandMazterNelson> smough's wife
[3:39:12] <Marpolo13> of course. not a boss
[3:39:13] <+Reveresao> big mama
[3:39:21] <DSD24> Right up mainstreet
[3:39:22] <aparadoxicalbanana> @Maids4lyfe @Remery_ darn that's a shame, understandable game design choice though
[3:39:31] <%Piemen99> monster tits?
[3:39:34] <IndoorSitup> @nina96 I have a feeling might stream this some more.
[3:39:42] <%Piemen99> monster tits
[3:39:43] <IndoorSitup> Pat might
[3:39:53] <%Remery_> yea there will be more monster tits
[3:39:56] <StromkoPenguin> This may be premature but this doesn't seem like a soulslike
[3:39:57] <+ThePerpetualPlayer1> So is this game good?
[3:40:01] <%Keyd00d> there are monster tits and MONSTER tits int his game
[3:40:03] <Dakuu75> "Be ready for an ambush." and Pat's character is like: "I hope so, I'm so fucking bored right now."
[3:40:04] <%Kiiper> Yes

[3:40:42] <%Ixiah> @AngriestPat so far, would you rather recommend Surge 2 or Code Vein ?
[3:40:49] <%Kirby_Sauce> Cheer500 if Pat were a gun, he'd be an old sawed off shotgun. That is to say... a boomer stick.

[3:41:57] <duffmd1> ammoThor
[3:41:58] <+chrishnaw> F
[3:41:59] <MicrotonalMatt> Ok but for real tho when do you get a tall buff gurl pawn with an ax/greatsword. That's all it feels like this game is missing.
[3:41:59] <CaptainFrankincense> You died
[3:41:59] <+moranprime> Yaaahoihoihoiiiii
[3:42:00] <SaltyDongs> f
[3:42:00] <bran316555> Since I don’t enjoy souls type games I’m sure I’d hate to play this.
[3:42:01] <@Pandora_Prime> Yeah I died there too
[3:42:01] <+xir0gravity> you should have probably talked to Coco back at the base before moving forward pat
[3:42:02] <%shootbang_exe> yeet\
[3:42:02] <BionicPulga> Haha
[3:42:03] <%invisi_bliss> BIG sword

[3:42:08] <%transporterthesequel> Excellent!
[3:42:09] <%vectorless_peon> thats one of the harder parts of the game
[3:42:10] <%CalderGaming> EXEMPLARIS EXCOMVNICATIONIS
[3:42:14] <%Ixiah> dont fight at a bridge xD
[3:42:32] <$i_am_therydon> pat you need to take out the anor londo archers
[3:42:37] <%Remery_> @bran316555 this one is much easier, my younger sister who isn't so good at souls games likes it
[3:42:38] <$Sphincter_Spelunker> this environment and repeating enemies are giving me Darksiders 1 vibes. I never finished Darksiders 1.
[3:42:45] <%gatoralus> this game is teaching me even more don't pay attention to most critics
[3:42:45] <%Agami23> why do the monsters in this have to sound like luigi's mansion ghosts?
[3:42:46] <%Basch71> the Zweihander is so goddamn strong
[3:42:47] <DSD24> "You are dead, dead dead,"
[3:42:48] <Dakuu75> can't make fun of Louis now
[3:42:48] <CptHarlok> FIrst rule just backstab. Second rule, don't fall.
[3:42:52] <Finakala> Yeah it does feel a bit like Darksiders
[3:42:55] <%Faustgesicht> what the sam hell is that sword?
[3:43:02] <BreakersAweigh> so what's the general consensus on this game? is it a decent game to scratch the soulsborne itch?
[3:43:04] <IndoorSitup> @angriestpat So is this game still just gonna be a one off?
[3:43:10] <Marpolo13> sword isn't big enough
[3:43:14] <Dakuu75> that's not a sword, that's a god-damn IRONING BOARD
[3:43:24] <bran316555> @remery_ Really? Alright, maybe I’ll give it a try through rental first
[3:43:34] <%Keyd00d> F
[3:43:35] <$Kenzo2000> Gobins ill like fire

[3:43:39] <Marpolo13> glass cannon louis gone again
[3:43:40] <DomunDomunDomun> it was too big to be called a sword
[3:43:42] <+Byleana> poor louis
[3:43:43] <DSD24> This looks pretty fun actually
[3:43:46] <%joylent_blue> BreakersAweigh its got some jank, but the systems are fun and unique for the genre, class switching whenever you want and stuff. its pretty cool
[3:43:46] <Dakuu75> Bye Louis
[3:43:46] <Finakala> Oof
[3:43:54] <%noobpsyboticus> this seems like the type of game that gets better the more you play it

[3:44:21] <%StaceMcGate> don't take it out on Louis
[3:44:25] <%Dr_Mooose> don't get snappy with him
[3:44:26] <Paperware> that enemy has all the jiggle physics]
[3:44:27] <%Ixiah> Call Paige, this seems more like Bloodborne Kappa
[3:44:28] <+Byleana> One tip: Dodge invincibility is good, but you get stunlocked pretty quickly. Block is usually the smarter option
[3:44:36] <%SummonerMagno> Gitgud Louis
[3:44:40] <BreakersAweigh> @joylent_blue thats what i thought. i played the demo of this and i definitely felt the pieces were there but they didn't line up well enough
[3:44:45] <+chrishnaw> Big hammer for big tiddies
[3:44:49] <%noobpsyboticus> more like "lose-is"
[3:44:52] <%TheDullaMAN> Try rolling Caster/Ranged
[3:45:10] <%Ixiah> get in there xD
[3:45:29] <%Remery_> keep penetrating her
[3:45:34] <Paperware> she's basically asylum demon's mom
[3:45:34] <%VanaSkiller> BOP that bitch
[3:45:39] <%boondoggle42> get those cheeks
[3:45:40] <DSD24> I am hoping the environments change up too
[3:45:45] <+chrishnaw> You. Did it.
[3:45:46] <BreakersAweigh> also i felt like the partners talked WAY too much
[3:45:54] <%StaceMcGate> Kevin story isnow complete
[3:46:03] <%joylent_blue> the partners do talk a lot, but thats part of their charm
[3:46:04] <Manwad> Having a companion seems to make crowd control way easier
[3:46:13] <DSD24> I never actually had a problem with pawns in Dragons Dogma
[3:46:17] <Finakala> Thanks music
[3:46:39] <%anticrust> Hey @AngriestPat is code vein good?
[3:46:44] <%dekkitout> By the 'My-ass-ma'

[3:46:55] <+moranprime> Attack proof fence
[3:46:57] <%TimetodiveLTX> my ass-mar
[3:47:06] <%anticrust> Hows it feel tho
[3:47:11] <%StaceMcGate> @AngriestPat notice how all the frame issues are with enemies behind fences?
[3:47:12] <%griffball13> i hear the later ones get better
[3:47:17] <Paperware> most unique moves on weapons are mapped on R1 + square
[3:47:18] <%Dr_Mooose> needs more anime
[3:47:22] <IndoorSitup> @angriestpat So is this game still just gonna be a one off?
[3:47:23] <Manwad> Looks like the best 7.3/10 money can buy
[3:47:25] <%anticrust> Hew it feeeeeeeeellllll
[3:47:27] <%Muzzle131> A little further than you levels get interesting

[3:48:01] <%kewlmyc> That's accurate
[3:48:03] <%joylent_blue> yoshkosh20 you bet we did
[3:48:11] <+moranprime> It gets an 8 because of big anime bobs

[3:48:18] <FaytLeingodz> kevin aleksFeels
[3:48:19] <IndoorSitup> It's an 8/10 in my book
[3:48:23] <%Animorphimagi> It's legit 10/10 for me compare to the rest of the year
[3:48:25] <%anticrust> Is it worth 60$ tho
[3:48:40] <+loukemia83> this or surge 2?
[3:48:44] <%anticrust> Kevin
[3:48:47] <Marpolo13> kevin is a thug

[3:49:15] <BreakersAweigh> i might wait to get this game on sale.
[3:49:30] <+exploitativity2> why wait to get the game on sale
[3:49:31] <%StaceMcGate> LUL
[3:49:33] <+Byleana> One thing I found that helped was playing with Japanese audio, sounds significantly better than the dub.
[3:49:34] <+moranprime> Ayy Kevin with the donation
[3:49:35] <%joylent_blue> thanks Kevin for the $20 LUL
[3:49:38] <+exploitativity2> when you can donate blood at twitch con and get it for free
[3:49:48] <%InugamiTheHound> god I love the music during this scene
[3:49:49] <+Darren716> Is that a new vegas voice actress?
[3:49:51] <karl_rex> I get the outside world looks like garbage but does the memory/sad feels world have to as well
[3:50:02] <+Darren716> Because damn she sounds familiar
[3:50:03] <Marpolo13> SCAMMAZED
[3:50:11] <Finakala> What else was there this year that is all around fantastic? DMC5, Sekiro, Iceborne, RE2make
[3:50:11] <Dakuu75> really? he's gonna be a greedy fuck?
[3:50:14] <TheOrzhovPrince> That's why I love God Eater too. The Presentation is amazing.
[3:50:17] <Dakuu75> fuck off kevin
[3:50:19] <%averyoddjew> and then he saw her again and then got killed
[3:50:20] <+PerrinIsDead> This music feels out of place
[3:50:21] <IndoorSitup> Apparantly because this game got so much attention when it was revealed at E3 thry delayed it to polish it up some more

[3:50:41] <DSD24> Why is Io taking her cloack off
