[0:06:46] <%LymanAl> chaos reigns
[0:06:47] <Man_in_the_Red> @blastazoid26 that was a mistake
[0:06:47] <+HyperCharge_Sam> Demon Souls is not coming to PC
[0:06:48] <marvel877> He's staying up late so that way he'll have an actual reason to not want to check out the Nintendo stream in the morning instead of going with his usual "Nintendo never announces good stuff when i watch them" excuse.
[0:06:54] <sleepers1mulant> I don’t buy consoles on release that’s just asking for a brick
[0:06:55] <Corvan> @blastazoid26 they confirmed that was a mistake, ps5 only

[0:07:09] <+NitronStreams> honestly coompared to all the shit they put in dmc4se dmcv as a whole a little dissappointing
[0:07:10] <Man_in_the_Red> shame that Demon Souls suddenly and without warning got cancelled Kappa
[0:07:13] <extradopeness> Unless ofc this is all a work
[0:07:24] <+Promessa_EX> @sleepers1mulant especially with chip shortages, expect some lower quality

[0:10:00] <%CommanderSqueaks> So can we talk about how Vergil can just change back into V whenever he wants now and how stupid busted that is?
[0:10:06] <+xBolts4Lifex> keep checking

[0:10:30] <%Fenrisulfr_V> @CommanderSqueaks There's no such thing as "busted" in singleplayer games.
[0:10:33] <DianaTheAscian> buying a console day one is so weird to me
[0:10:39] <TheShockVox> Bullshit how they put it up early
[0:10:45] <%saltenergy> video games

[0:11:24] <Corvan> I've always had to wait several years after release for consoles, so buying day 1 will be an experience.
[0:11:32] <%koolaid_kevster> im down
[0:11:37] <DianaTheAscian> farming timeworn maps is a nightmare god
[0:11:40] <+xBolts4Lifex> I mean even if they did wait the result would be the same. Maybe they tried to get a head start so it wouldn't be as bad?
[0:11:41] <%Fenrisulfr_V> Digital games should be $10+ cheaper than physical.

[0:28:25] <Vyneci> I really hope that all the kicking and screaming will change that, and I hope the reason we didn't get DmC: DE on PC is because it's DmC so no one cared

[0:28:31] <Man_in_the_Red> remember, that 70 bones is the starter price
[0:28:31] <%CommanderSqueaks> So, so hey guys... Do you think that because they sold out so quickly on the preorders that means they'll make more so they'll totally have them on launch day so I'm not waiting 3-5 months for a PS5? Right guys? Right?.... Please.

[0:43:01] <MayorRev> ohh you'll get to meet him later
[0:43:14] <Man_in_the_Red> its just Sword Bot doing Sword Bot things
[0:43:15] <%ClericOfSparda> Is that robo-Pyramid head?
[0:43:24] <Man_in_the_Red> nothing to gawk at... yes
[0:43:31] <%Jjrossman> This music is so fuckin old
[0:43:33] <%Jjrossman> I love it
[0:43:38] <$LulzorGG> you can get to the door before the boss and kill him there with punches
[0:43:39] <Louie_Salmon> The coins are tricky to get used to, your movement affects their arc
[0:43:40] <Man_in_the_Red> yet* doodInjury
[0:43:41] <%AncelDeLambert> look at this Vergil chaos
[0:43:41] <%Jjrossman> What is this?
[0:43:41] <+skylerpilot> maintaining air time / sliding will get you up to a x3 bonus multiplier! Now I'm not sure but I feel like it ups damage as well
[0:43:42] <MayorRev> who could he be?
[0:43:44] <lazerscraper> @radicalapollo how can you switch and buffer charge fast enough for the coin?
[0:43:44] <%Jjrossman> Toonami?
[0:43:46] <$LulzorGG> but you still have to fight him at the end
[0:43:50] <%AncelDeLambert> Pat this is Vergil's carnage
[0:43:52] <Golden_Battler> The bassline REALLY reminds me of Goldeneye in some parts
[0:43:54] <Fear_Ranjer> These drums are so damn good UUUGH
[0:43:57] <deuxexgodzilla> Who was sword bro? was it yellow virgil
[0:43:57] <MayorRev> drums going ham
[0:44:04] <+tigerfang86> this vergil is TOO COOL
[0:44:09] <Louie_Salmon> Like if you're moving left, they fly diagonally left. Like Isaac tears
[0:44:09] <%Saltmeisterr> WTF Y
[0:44:11] <MagicalBiscuit> Ive been trying to catch up to current CSB cast and im on SBFC 253 but i just finished an episode where pat talks about how its bad to game with your arm at a 90 degree angle
[0:44:11] <%Saltmeisterr> YO
[0:44:15] <eyedol33> secrets!
[0:44:16] <stabbityrabbit> This game really does need an annnouncer to put it over the top. Something like Killer Instinct has.
[0:44:18] <%BoxNavy> hm...
[0:44:20] <%Saltmeisterr> THIS MUSIC JAMMIN
[0:44:21] <Fear_Ranjer> WORM???
[0:44:22] <%Fooguwu> boots cats boots boots cats boots cats
[0:44:23] <radicalApollo> @lazerscraper Gotta be fast, don't know what to tell ya
[0:44:23] <Louie_Salmon> That arm jamming
[0:44:28] <warmnoid> drum and bass
[0:44:29] <+skylerpilot> so many great secrets in these levels
[0:44:35] <%Jjrossman> Like I said, sounds like Toonami.
[0:44:47] <+Pyroclase> ooooh, I saw that Z-fighting
[0:44:49] <MayorRev> oh does this not have controller support?
[0:44:49] <The_Penndragon> the hypest shit, oh my god
[0:45:02] <+tigerfang86> BE GOOD AT VIDEO GAMES pat
[0:45:09] <Profmcstevie> Flick enough coins and probability is on your side
[0:45:09] <%Saltmeisterr> i didn't know this game had D&B?
[0:45:11] <%BoxNavy> the coin gun is really good
[0:45:12] <+skylerpilot> @MayorRev pretty sure it does
[0:45:18] <Louie_Salmon> Damn, I never found that
[0:45:25] <Animorphimagi> Am i the only one who finds the music gratingly repetitive?
[0:45:28] <radicalApollo> A
[0:45:29] <%Fooguwu> that music fucks
[0:45:31] <MayorRev> ahh ok
[0:45:33] <+diabuddha> @MayorRev its early access
[0:45:34] <eyedol33> You can reflect many things off that coin as well
[0:45:38] <%AgniBrandt> Holy fuck, thank you to whoever mentioned that PS5 preorders were back up
[0:45:39] <rafaelba93> i think this one is too fast for controller
[0:45:40] <%BoxNavy> yes
[0:45:40] <lazerscraper> shit slaps
[0:45:45] <%AgniBrandt> I managed to snag one
[0:45:46] <$LulzorGG> music in the cyber grind is ten times better
[0:45:49] <+Pyroclase> Secrets in these kinds of games always bother me, because I absolutely killthe game's pacing searching for them
[0:45:52] <+tigerfang86> it's NEIL BREEN TIME
[0:45:56] <dunkle321> Nah this game can't work with controller
[0:46:01] <%BigLoserJosh> fuckin love the shop interact animation for some reason
[0:46:03] <$LulzorGG> preorders are up on best buy but their website is trash
[0:46:04] <MayorRev> Neil breen time
[0:46:06] <CaptHat211> This feels like Doom had a baby w/ the Crank films
[0:46:07] <+Pyroclase> Ion Fury was the worst for this, there were secrets EVERYWHERE
[0:46:10] <Vaun0x> CYBER GRIND HAS BEST SONG FREE
[0:46:22] <%doc_ock_rokc> gonna go to sleep have fun
[0:46:26] <%AgniBrandt> It is. I was hitting the checkout button for like 15 minutes before I got through
[0:46:29] <+weekend_nachos> jungle drum & bass ftw
[0:46:35] <lazerscraper> i just wanna fill that style bar hard
[0:46:38] <MayorRev> Ion Fury would enrage pat's goblins too much
[0:46:39] <Profmcstevie> But do we prefer tons of little secrets or few with high value
[0:46:42] <%scottysunday> the cleanse has begun
[0:46:45] <SourTortuga> hello midnight brethren
[0:46:45] <%crimsonharvest> this music is radical
[0:46:50] <+BoBoCatBurger> Ion fury’s secrets were too fucking obtuse somey

[0:46:59] <Vaun0x> Listen to bomberman hero ost 👀
[0:47:04] <%Saltmeisterr> few with high value
[0:47:04] <eyedol33> oh boi!
[0:47:08] <Sundaysmiles01> this music reminds me of old newgrounds flash games from the 90's
[0:47:09] <Man_in_the_Red> a few real strong secrets are good
[0:47:11] <MayorRev> But damn were they good

[0:48:54] <%likethemusiq> punch when he strikes, big parry
[0:48:54] <$xXRealGamerThaigeXx> you generally want to parry the last hit cus if you parry the first 2 you can still get hit by the combo

[0:55:02] <Fear_Ranjer> god this game is so cool wtf
[0:55:21] <%GabeSweetMan> We already have Virgil and he's the first damn boss lol
[0:55:25] <MayorRev> this game can be a real ballbuster

[0:56:12] <+jacintafor> @PatStaresAt can you throw the coin swap to a different gun and shoot it?
[0:56:17] <%GabeSweetMan> Bye cool sword guy.
[0:56:20] <MayorRev> good stuff
[0:56:21] <c60_Jam> PogChamp THE CHOSEN PAT
[0:56:21] <%GabeSweetMan> You were the coolest.
[0:56:22] <polybious12> and swordsmachine goes down
[0:56:22] <+diabuddha> yes
[0:56:24] <kamesenpai> why does the machine bleed
[0:56:24] <dunkle321> Yes
[0:56:25] <Sundaysmiles01> now do it again, but blindfolded
[0:56:26] <eyedol33> Yes
[0:56:26] <dunkle321> You can
[0:56:26] <MayorRev> actually dead now
[0:56:26] <%gitgouda> that looked fun to play.
[0:56:28] <lazerscraper> yes
[0:56:28] <Louie_Salmon> Yes
[0:56:30] <c60_Jam> @jacintafor Yes
[0:56:30] <Rexus93> @jacintafor only hit scan weapons
[0:56:30] <polybious12> yes you can
[0:56:31] <%BoxNavy> BAB
[0:56:31] <BoneofMalkav> yes
[0:56:33] <%BoxNavy> BABAC
[0:56:33] <+skm742> the answer is VERY YES
[0:56:34] <SheefEatsBeef> only hitscan
[0:56:36] <%mield916> yes
[0:56:38] <MayorRev> bab
[0:56:41] <+jacintafor> thats rad
[0:56:42] <allyalice> yes but only with hitscan weapons like the pistol and a later weapon
[0:56:48] <Louie_Salmon> The level challenges are great
[0:56:53] <dunkle321> Shotgun isn't hit scan
[0:56:54] <+BoBoCatBurger> Machines are fueled by blood that’s why they bleed
[0:56:55] <SheefEatsBeef> it must be hitscan, shotgun is projectile
[0:56:59] <c60_Jam> PogChamp
[0:57:01] <eyedol33> you can punch the coin too
[0:57:02] <Louie_Salmon> Shotgun might be kinda hard to do that with, yeah
[0:57:04] <+skm742> gun 4 is VERY good for that
[0:57:04] <polybious12> as of right now the only two weapons that can are pistol and railgun
[0:57:06] <+Pyroclase> it works but the shotgun isn't the gun for it
[0:57:07] <+tigerfang86> PUMP IT UP
[0:57:08] <BoneofMalkav> AND you can throw the coin into an enemy's projectile and it'll shoot it's own projectile back
[0:57:08] <Cherokia666> Aw, no controller? I thought Pat was a pro-gamer
[0:57:10] <SheefEatsBeef> PUMP IT

[0:59:03] <MayorRev> has woolie played this? i think he'd get a kick out of it
[0:59:16] <MayorRev> especially since he's on board with doom
[0:59:19] <seashanti> more like a sick out of it
[0:59:31] <c60_Jam> Woolie doesn't play mnk games Kappa
[0:59:34] <Fiiib> fun fact, you can actually parry your own shotgun bullet like an exceed
[0:59:35] <%Broand> Use your piercing shot more
[0:59:38] <Rexus93> you totally can
[0:59:39] <CaptHat211> This reminds me of Metroid Prime
[0:59:41] <Cici_TheMoonRabbit> You totally can.
[0:59:42] <+Ez3z> its true, its just hard
[0:59:42] <+tigerfang86> one guy?
[0:59:43] <+diabuddha> use coin to bounce the big bombo blast
[0:59:43] <rafaelba93> you can juggle them a little
[0:59:48] <+Ez3z> and impractical
[0:59:52] <%Saltmeisterr> tose a coin in their mouth to stun it
[0:59:52] <MayorRev> reflecting with coins?
[0:59:53] <Louie_Salmon> This game is for Woolie and it just came out, so I'm certain he'll play it months from now when everyone has stopped talking about it
[0:59:53] <Man_in_the_Red> pretty sure its nonsense
[0:59:54] <%AlphaTauri> hes right
[0:59:54] <polybious12> no if you flick a coin into his mouth when he charges, he'll choke and die
[0:59:56] <allyalice> you can but its really risky
[1:00:01] <+diabuddha> or just shotgun and dash
[1:00:15] <+verrworr> you can counter it if you nail the timing, gl with that tho
[1:00:21] <MayorRev> @Saltmeisterr wait what that's so silly

[1:04:25] <Cherokia666> Pat doesn't have rhythm. he hates music
[1:04:37] <Cici_TheMoonRabbit> Shotgun pump 3 into point blank for huge damage and restoring hp.
[1:04:38] <Louie_Salmon> Huh, I actually don't know why the charge shot flew off like that
[1:04:49] <MayorRev> you can do it!
[1:04:54] <Rexus93> shotgun is your best friend for healing
[1:04:58] <Cherokia666> The charge shot reflects off a few enemies.
[1:04:59] <+diabuddha> if you shoot the shotgun then dash through you can get back a lot of health from the chotgun blood
[1:05:05] <polybious12> this game is still in early access by the way
[1:05:13] <%mikessdd> Pat is using mouse and keyboard? is this a dream?
[1:05:15] <+BoBoCatBurger> The heads reflect nades
[1:05:17] <MayorRev> now that i mention it this whole game feels like a parody you'd see on TV
[1:05:17] <Louie_Salmon> Yeah think like bloodborne, if you just go in and do damage you'll get health back
[1:05:31] <%scottysunday> I found diving into enemies with a shotgun blast was usually a good trade

[1:06:22] <+BoBoCatBurger> It’s not based on damage you have to get their blood to splash on you

[1:16:26] <+Vorga1339> the worst part about this cerberus fight is the music
[1:16:27] <+tigerfang86> he actually makes money off of buying the ocnsole

[1:16:41] <MayorRev> @sleepers1mulant just consume product! dont ask questions
[1:16:43] <madogod> Pat has big streamer money so he can afford all the console
[1:16:46] <%DappercatEsquire> the blood is the fuel, the worms are their money, the bones are their dollars
[1:16:46] <%DensityD> wall jumpan
[1:16:46] <brachydios777> Discless or naw?
[1:16:47] <%Daniel_Is_I> Normal consumers shouldn't buy them day 1 because of potential problems like red rings. But Pat is a HYPERCONSUMER
[1:16:52] <%DensityD> wall jump man
[1:16:56] <DraxTD> maybe @DianaTheAscian , I've never had a defective one myself

[1:38:42] <+Jaysky> This is a late ass stream for you Pat, why you up?
[1:38:44] <Shwepie> When did we start playing The Witness?
[1:38:46] <%RyTYoung> I dozed off im confused I thought we were fighting the demons not puzzles
[1:38:46] <%sleepers1mulant> GOD
[1:38:53] <Louie_Salmon> Gotta kill this puzzle dead, with thinking
[1:39:20] <MayorRev> Ohh i see it
[1:39:25] <Grandma_Amari> Use your BRAIN CELLS as AMMO
[1:39:26] <%Broand> Start with green
[1:39:28] <DianaTheAscian> i got it
[1:39:32] <%RyTYoung> @shwepie my thought exactly
[1:39:32] <+Vorga1339> Humanity is dumb, Puzzles are fuel, Hell is full
[1:39:34] <+CourageTheCat> Oh god please don’t be a swastika by mistake
[1:39:37] <+aWanderingKaivo> I don't know much about Ultrakill and am late, was this an optional side secret thing?
[1:39:48] <%Broand> Yes
[1:39:48] <+diabuddha> yes
[1:39:50] <Rexus93> @aWanderingKaivo yes
[1:39:50] <MayorRev> this music is nice
[1:39:52] <MayorRev> :)
[1:39:52] <+Vorga1339> it's a secret level
[1:39:52] <Cici_TheMoonRabbit> @aWanderingKaivo Yep, secret level
[1:39:56] <Louie_Salmon> Nah this is the game, there are no gund
[1:39:57] <%Broand> Pat made a wish for peace and this is what he got
[1:40:01] <+korean_random> no, this is the actual game
[1:40:03] <UnfilteredComic> Red has to go left
[1:40:04] <%BoxNavy> moon2W
[1:40:06] <+aWanderingKaivo> coolcoolcool
[1:40:08] <%Ranryu692> I keep expecting Pat to end the stream, but then remember we're only like an hour and a half in
[1:40:08] <%Broand> this is what limbo is REALLY like
[1:40:09] <BlacSoul> start green?
[1:40:10] <%Saltmeisterr> green is the key
[1:40:12] <Minerslovegames> this has to be the last one, right?
[1:40:13] <%a_mad_dragon> blue first
[1:40:21] <$floralkami> HUGE PUZZLES. HUGE PUZZLES MEAN HUGE THINKS.
[1:40:21] <twisted__fister> maybe start with green
[1:40:30] <SaltkeyAndAckfish> red goes right across 2 blocks, otherwise you block off one of the blips
[1:40:33] <%DensityD> be prepared for a hoard of enemies, this is all just to calm you down
[1:40:33] <MayorRev> what is this, Talos Principle?
[1:40:37] <ZeroCruz> I am wood stupid
[1:40:41] <%DensityD> it's a trap
[1:40:47] <%fishmonger555> at least it doesn't reset the entire puzzleroom after you fail
[1:40:48] <+Vorga1339> he almost had it
[1:40:49] <polybious12> by god he's doing it
[1:40:53] <SaltkeyAndAckfish> yeah, that's the jist
[1:40:55] <wibbwobbler> poozels
[1:40:59] <tonfirean> Red can't go down or left because that renders the other dot ungettable.
[1:41:02] <Profmcstevie> Green first, it's the most locked in
[1:41:03] <%Broand> Start with greeeeeb
[1:41:06] <Cici_TheMoonRabbit> Hes beginning to believe
[1:41:10] <%BoxNavy> i checked out a long time ago
[1:41:14] <+korean_random> close, but not quite
[1:41:24] <+CourageTheCat> He’s believing in the heart of the cards!!!
[1:41:25] <ghorko> green has to go through the blue X
[1:41:26] <Fanciful_Unicorn> red straight across, green down and around, blue up and around. As far as I an tell
[1:41:26] <+alternative_flu> I want to believe
[1:41:27] <deuxexgodzilla> I got it. do you want help?
[1:41:29] <Frostydough1> But... but BABA
[1:41:35] <%CrazyD1amond> Hey guys, remember when this game was Ultrakill?
[1:41:37] <+skylerpilot> this is how you unlock Frog Fractions 3
[1:41:39] <%Saltmeisterr> nope
[1:41:39] <%Valdorick> Almost...
[1:41:40] <$Dakuu75> so this game just plays one-note for music, the whole time?
[1:41:40] <tidalwafer> rememberi that bit in the simpsons when theyre all trying to solve the rubicks cube, thats how I feel right noe
[1:41:42] <%Saltmeisterr> but close
[1:41:42] <whittacre> green can olny go one direction, start with that
[1:41:43] <SaltkeyAndAckfish> YOU HAVE UNO
[1:41:46] <radicalApollo> NOOOO you almost had it

[1:42:24] <lazerscraper> @densityd oh my god, this is a fps game
[1:42:30] <%Valdorick> One color never needs to touch the sides.
[1:42:30] <radicalApollo> He has the right idea but keeps whiffing
[1:42:34] <tonfirean> Can't you just grab all the dots with green?
[1:42:34] <Zetheos> ignore that goddamn colour
[1:42:35] <Louie_Salmon> Hold on
[1:42:36] <Rexus93> red gets no dots
[1:42:38] <deuxexgodzilla> can red go across?
[1:42:40] <UnfilteredComic> Green
[1:42:43] <%TheWinged7> green goes bottom edge
[1:42:48] <SaltkeyAndAckfish> -640, pat red has to go right across the green x to avoid blocking off the dots
[1:42:50] <tidalwafer> Pat you dont need every line to get a dot
[1:42:51] <$Falilth> wait i thought this was ultra kill not the witness
[1:42:51] <+CourageTheCat> The light arpeggiating in the background is REALLY making it for me
[1:42:55] <Zetheos> YES
[1:42:57] <+diabuddha> i think you can grab the outside with blue

[2:13:01] <%sleepers1mulant> good save
[2:13:39] <Louie_Salmon> @mnemonicjohnny Eh faces aren't too tough, but maybe I'll try it against a mindflayer

[2:19:52] <tonfirean> It autoheadshots a nearby enemy?
[2:20:02] <TheBadIdeaMan> Hope he gets to the end of Limbo at least
[2:20:06] <Nohorse> Are you really gonna let that Sans looking headass laugh at you >:C
[2:20:06] <tonfirean> cool
[2:20:07] <Mnemonicjohnny> @tonfirean Shots that hit the coin automatically hit enemy weakpoints. Hitting at *exactly* the right timing splits your shot in two.
[2:20:31] <MayorRev> coin time!
[2:20:35] <%BoxNavy> you keep getting redblocked by those dudes
[2:20:39] <%dante_must_die_exe> SSShitstorm nice
[2:20:50] <+Vorga1339> overheat gud
[2:20:51] <FeltSn0wman> those split shots can also create split shots across multiple coins btw
[2:20:59] <%Chimeraelite> you fucking MULCHED HIM
[2:21:11] <MayorRev> stomp'd
[2:21:11] <Cherokia666> hah
[2:21:11] <FeltSn0wman> LUL
[2:21:16] <%Typhaeon> Red but ALSO BLUE
[2:21:18] <Rexus93> dual path level
[2:21:18] <%Broand> Getting red sends you to the blue side
[2:21:19] <Man_in_the_Red> so uh, good luck navigating
[2:21:21] <DKDiamantes> I see you're using the same insane blast-o coin Rufus does
[2:21:22] <Cici_TheMoonRabbit> secret path
[2:21:24] <polybious12> red was the harder path
[2:21:30] <FeltSn0wman> take both
[2:21:31] <polybious12> so you get both!
[2:21:44] <tonfirean> Eekum Bokum 2: The Eekening
[2:21:50] <FeltSn0wman> or eventually get both
[2:22:01] <Cici_TheMoonRabbit> You should try to get both skulls though
[2:22:09] <%ShinobiPhoenix> I am so opposite of bummed out about not getting my PS5 pre-order. Would have been cool, but there was nothing at launch at I "needed". (Spider-Man MM is PS4 too)
[2:22:38] <+Vorga1339> follow the blue path out pat
[2:22:44] <%BoxNavy> whats happenin
[2:22:44] <%Reveresao> Is pat gonna play BPM?
[2:22:45] <%Broand> you can only carry one at a time, so come back for the blue
[2:22:49] <%IncredibleMeh> come back for blue later
[2:22:54] <%Broand> lower path is progress
[2:22:58] <+RetroGiinthir> only need one or the other remember?
[2:22:59] <%Broand> Or this
[2:23:08] <Cypher_Ranger_PhazON> So has chat told pat how he can punch his own shotgun shots?
[2:23:16] <FeltSn0wman> but what happens if you get both
[2:23:25] <%BoxNavy> yes
[2:23:36] <%ShinobiPhoenix> so... what's with the skull in his other hand?
[2:23:40] <%Sir_Gawain_Lotsson> Pat why the fuck are you awake
[2:23:42] <$floralkami> Eekum Bokum Red and Eekum Bokum Blue for the Killboy Ultra
[2:23:51] <%BoxNavy> skulls are keys
[2:23:52] <+Pyroclase> holy cow, nice
[2:23:53] <%BoxNavy> like doom :)
[2:24:02] <%IncredibleMeh> he has been told I've yet to see if he knows
[2:24:08] <dakotachipmath> @ShinobiPhoenix to be or not to be that is the question
[2:24:16] <rkytek> Youve made a great game, mate.
[2:24:25] <+Vorga1339> you missed the exit bub
[2:24:30] <+skylerpilot> @Cypher_Ranger_PhazON Pat figured it out on his own as soon as he got it
[2:24:46] <%BoxNavy> yea
[2:24:47] <Cypher_Ranger_PhazON> lmao nice
[2:24:49] <Cherokia666> yes
[2:24:53] <polybious12> yeah, you did red first, so now the level's fucked up
[2:25:15] <%ShinobiPhoenix> so... should I attempt to get an Xbox Series X instead? I really wanted to wait for the Series V instead and neither console has anything I need at launch
[2:25:28] <%ShinobiPhoenix> but Game Pass is a sexy deal
[2:25:29] <dakotachipmath> Get a PS5
[2:25:38] <%BoxNavy> just wait on the ps5
[2:25:42] <Man_in_the_Red> Game Pass is also on PC
[2:25:44] <+Pyroclase> ... What on earth is a Series V?
[2:25:46] <%BoxNavy> theyll probably open more preorders soon
[2:25:52] <%saltenergy> has anyone here even met someone whos thought about buying the Xbox Sex?
[2:25:53] <Zaphire_Saucypants> gamepass on PC is good enough for me
[2:25:53] <%ShinobiPhoenix> I will get a PS5 at some point, but I want Series V too
[2:25:57] <$floralkami> @shinobiphoenix wasn't that a fake leak?
[2:26:00] <+Vorga1339> PAT NO
[2:26:02] <lazerscraper> wish you could parry the drones back once you kill them
[2:26:06] <FeltSn0wman> go get blue
[2:26:08] <+Vorga1339> lel
[2:26:08] <%BoxNavy> series v monkaS
[2:26:13] <FeltSn0wman> you can
[2:26:14] <%TIME_PUNCHER> that's green
[2:26:15] <Cherokia666> Blue = Red
[2:26:19] <stanlychicken> you can parry them
[2:26:21] <%IncredibleMeh> OH THANK GOD
[2:26:23] <%ShinobiPhoenix> I assume there would be a Series X without a disc drive
[2:26:24] <suikudo> why do you avoid checkpoints?
[2:26:26] <Cherokia666> It's Purple
[2:26:28] <+aWanderingKaivo> why is that door opening sound so satisfying
[2:26:34] <FeltSn0wman> you can parry anything that isnt hitscan
[2:26:36] <%IncredibleMeh> Pat if you had actually mixed up the podiums you would have had to double back AGAIN
[2:26:42] <AFlyingTaco1> Are preorders for the SeX even open?
[2:26:43] <FeltSn0wman> with very few exceptions
[2:26:46] <%BoxNavy> shoulda been called series E. so you could get xbox SEX B)
[2:26:50] <%ShinobiPhoenix> I don't need the disk drive
[2:26:51] <$floralkami> @shinobiphoenix i thought that was the Series S
[2:26:59] <%IncredibleMeh> you can even parry your own coins
[2:27:06] <Man_in_the_Red> i mean, its already the XSex
[2:27:08] <%ShinobiPhoenix> Series S is not the power of the X though
[2:27:15] <%Saltmeisterr> good that coin ricochet is so sexy
[2:27:16] <Man_in_the_Red> or, XSeX
[2:27:17] <dakotachipmath> This game has way too much noise jesus. Soundtracks kind of giving me a headache
[2:27:31] <%ShinobiPhoenix> and the pre-orders for Series X are 22nd
[2:27:36] <$floralkami> @shinobiphoenix yeah, i think that was the Series S that physically could not have a disc drive
[2:27:38] <FeltSn0wman> getting a 5x multikill with split coins is so nut worthy tbh
[2:27:39] <+skylerpilot> its already the Xbox Sex...Xbox Series X Xbox Se X
[2:27:48] <FeltSn0wman> look behind you
[2:27:50] <Cherokia666> ... sure they will
[2:27:51] <%TheWinged7> psaBig psaWrong
[2:27:51] <+Vorga1339> have fun pat
[2:27:52] <%BoxNavy> if you want an xbox just get the X imo
[2:27:54] <Mnemonicjohnny> GET READY TO GET YOUR BUTTHOLE REAMED, PAT.
[2:27:54] <dakotachipmath> PS5 Pre-orders announced yet?
[2:27:54] <FeltSn0wman> best secret btw
[2:27:55] <+tigerfang86> untrue

[2:28:03] <%mornerboi> @dakotachipmath i kind of agree; im enjoying watching it but i feel like if I tried to play it myself i'd get sick
[2:28:04] <%Typhaeon> Oh man

[2:28:15] <Mnemonicjohnny> AGNI AND RUDRA TIME, THAS RIGHT
[2:28:15] <allyalice> check out their names, its Agni and Rudra
[2:28:15] <%beepbeepbopbop> DMC 3 all over again

[2:28:19] <DKDiamantes> That looks like death
[2:28:20] <%IncredibleMeh> what is S I G H
[2:28:20] <lazerscraper> PogChamp PogChamp PogChamp PogChamp PogChamp PogChamp PogChamp PogChamp PogChamp
[2:28:22] <%ShinobiPhoenix> yeah, but the Series S doesn't have the power of the X, so I was waiting for whatever the V was. a discless Series X
[2:28:22] <MayorRev> notice their names!
[2:28:24] <+Vorga1339> yall need to listen to more drum and bass if this is headache inducing
[2:28:24] <TheBadIdeaMan> P A R R Y
[2:28:26] <Grandma_Amari> OH WOAH
[2:28:27] <%Broand> Welcome to your secret boss
[2:28:32] <%the_mental_punk> is this a character action fps?
[2:28:35] <Grandma_Amari> That's a REALLY fucking cool reference
[2:28:36] <%Ranryu692> Agony and Tundra lol
[2:28:48] <Grandma_Amari> Wonder if you gotta kill em at the same time too
[2:28:49] <Louie_Salmon> Oh my god it is agni and rudra, I wondered why they picked such specific names like that
[2:28:51] <+skylerpilot> yeah its a great reference to dmc 3
[2:28:53] <Grandma_Amari> YEP
[2:28:54] <$floralkami> @shinobiphoenix again, i think that was called out to be fake...
[2:28:56] <%Typhaeon> Kill them at the same time fucker!
[2:29:00] <%Typhaeon> Have fun LuL
[2:29:00] <DianaTheAscian> yeyeye
[2:29:00] <+Ez3z> kill em both fucker
[2:29:03] <TheBadIdeaMan> YO IT IS ANGI AND RUDRA
[2:29:04] <+tigerfang86> THE CLASSIC
[2:29:10] <MayorRev> dont let the skeleton win!
[2:29:11] <%BoxNavy> gotta play a balancing game with the hp EleGiggle
[2:29:19] <+TylerRich117> DS2 up in here
[2:29:20] <Grandma_Amari> AGNI AND RUDRA LOST WEIGHT
[2:29:23] <Cici_TheMoonRabbit> This game actually has a ton of DMC references.
[2:29:25] <AFlyingTaco1> Time to git gud son
[2:29:27] <%ShinobiPhoenix> @floralkami I mean I still expect Microsoft to do exactly that later
[2:29:34] <skyguy777> Do you get double shotguns after you kill them???? lol
[2:29:46] <+clownlore> does pat know he can punch boost the shotgun
[2:29:46] <Notterr> is this the new DMC?
[2:29:47] <FeltSn0wman> i wish lmao
[2:29:47] <Man_in_the_Red> @cici_themoonrabbit really now, the game with a style meter has DMC references
[2:29:54] <+spacehouse> I thought I hated harpsichords Pat
[2:29:54] <Man_in_the_Red> Foolishness
[2:29:56] <$floralkami> "swordmachine" = chainsaw
[2:29:56] <%BoxNavy> yeah shinobi like i said just wait for official word on a mid-range
[2:29:59] <FeltSn0wman> shotgun swapping is probably the better thing to learn with shotguns
[2:30:02] <Rexus93> you got this mate
[2:30:14] <+Vorga1339> god damn I didn't pick up on these two being agni and rudra, the other dmc references in this are much more blatant
[2:30:25] <+aWanderingKaivo> swordsmachine like swordsman, but its a machine instead of a man
[2:30:51] <+Pyroclase> Oh no they do the thinnnnnng
[2:30:52] <%ShinobiPhoenix> if i had gotten a PS5 Digital, I would still only be playing Spider-Man MM and Devil May Cry V SE and wait for Cyberpunk, though none of those games are PS5 exclusive, so I am not missing out, two of them even upgrade to PS5 versions, so I am sort of feeling "weird" about not getting my pre-order in
[2:30:55] <Louie_Salmon> I don't. know why he's so allergic to the dash, it has i-frames and stamina comes back super fast
[2:31:03] <Rexus93> GOTTEM
[2:31:03] <DianaTheAscian> FUCKING NICE
[2:31:04] <%Saltmeisterr> NOICE
[2:31:04] <+TylerRich117> SeemsGood
[2:31:07] <%mornerboi> PogChamp
[2:31:07] <MayorRev> epiccccc
[2:31:12] <+Vorga1339> congrats that's one of the four buttons for the alt weapon
[2:31:17] <%BoxNavy> 3
[2:31:18] <dakotachipmath> GREATO JOB
[2:31:19] <%Valdorick> Get Tbaged
[2:31:21] <BlacSoul> whole plan was keep killing them
[2:31:21] <Grandma_Amari> Noooo you can't just use one gun and strafejump! Haha nailgun go BRRRRRRT
[2:31:30] <%IncredibleMeh> THE SLAB
[2:31:31] <+tigerfang86> BOOP
[2:31:31] <%Typhaeon> The secret leads to ANOTHER secret
[2:31:32] <%Puhff> wtfg late night pat?
[2:31:35] <polybious12> three more
[2:31:40] <%IncredibleMeh> now find the others
[2:31:43] <Rexus93> real boss time
[2:31:44] <Mnemonicjohnny> @PatStaresAt THAT is the secret weapon unlock method.
[2:31:52] <+skm742> I think that's the hardest though
[2:31:54] <TheBadIdeaMan> FUCK THIS BOSS
[2:31:55] <$spardanwarrior> yooooo
[2:31:55] <+epoladia> bayonetta?
[2:31:57] <%BoxNavy> HIDEOUS DansGame
[2:31:57] <Louie_Salmon> Actual Bayonetta enemy
[2:31:58] <+tigerfang86> OH SHIT
[2:31:58] <%Saltmeisterr> o hey a bayonetta boss
[2:31:58] <Grandma_Amari> Wonder if pat picked up on the Agni and Rudra reference or not
[2:31:58] <Notterr> bayonneta?
[2:32:07] <DKDiamantes> Accurate name anyway
[2:32:13] <+doc_savage> Shoot the vag I guess
[2:32:15] <%beepbeepbopbop> Mecha bayonnetta angels
[2:32:15] <%za7az> Pat's mom?!
[2:32:18] <+skylerpilot> is pat too afraid to go to sleep because of RTX pre orders?
[2:32:23] <Man_in_the_Red> good trade Kappa
[2:32:23] <%BoxNavy> scorpion = crustacean
[2:32:27] <Grandma_Amari> Forgiven Scorpion
[2:32:28] <FeltSn0wman> that hook is the hardest parry in the game iirc
[2:32:37] <%Broand> Hit the weak point for massive damage
[2:32:38] <Man_in_the_Red> @skylerpilot i imagine so now that you mention it
[2:32:39] <+primax104> is that mecha pat?
[2:32:50] <AFlyingTaco1> @skylerpilot It was probably the PS5 preorder, which he somehow got
[2:32:57] <Louie_Salmon> @feltsn0wman Holy shit, what CAN'T be parried
[2:33:05] <skyguy777> Punch his dick!!!
[2:33:07] <BlacSoul> Alright no look parries are pretty cool
[2:33:09] <JayPastaForce> That's both Savior and a Bayonetta angel
[2:33:16] <$floralkami> @shinobiphoenix tbh, i think Microsoft might be trying to make the jump to selling straight up prebuilt gaming PCs soon, with the way their lineup and their game pass deal is setup. also, i thought at least Spiderman MM was PS5 exclusive
[2:33:17] <%ShinobiPhoenix> i even HAD the PS5 in my Amazon cart, but because was no product page, I didn't trust it, so I didn't buy it
[2:33:21] <FeltSn0wman> uhh the act 3 boss melee attacks, malicious face explosions
[2:33:39] <polybious12> the coin toss is affected by your movement
[2:33:45] <FeltSn0wman> most melee attacks that arent from swordsmachine or the later 2 boss tbh
[2:33:50] <+ausl0> hideous mass lol
[2:33:58] <%ShinobiPhoenix> then they would unavailable and THEn the page went up with the product unavailable, what a mess
[2:34:06] <Sol_Install> late boys streams
[2:34:13] <%Ranryu692> hey why am I in this game?
[2:34:20] <%ShinobiPhoenix> Spider-Man MM is on PS4 also with a free PS5 upgrade
[2:34:25] <%BoxNavy> pat should stream at degen hours more often
[2:34:29] <FeltSn0wman> learning how to parry the shit out of swordsmachine is so much fun
[2:34:37] <Mnemonicjohnny> @FeltSn0wman Wanna hear something funny? You CAN parry that one boss's punches.
[2:34:41] <$floralkami> ah, that's what you meant
[2:34:46] <%ShinobiPhoenix> so no one is actually missing out on that either, plus, I have a PS4 Pro, so it will look almost as good
[2:34:49] <FeltSn0wman> yeah i know ive done it lol
[2:34:55] <Cherokia666> There ya go. The meaty bits
[2:34:55] <FeltSn0wman> its sick
[2:35:05] <+MeMillionthDollar> F
[2:35:07] <AFlyingTaco1> ha ha ha
[2:35:10] <+Vorga1339> clap makes a vertical shockwave
[2:35:10] <MayorRev> good try
[2:35:10] <DKDiamantes> Thats brutal
[2:35:14] <lazerscraper> i wanna see this boss get styled on
[2:35:15] <%BoxNavy> ha.
[2:35:18] <+SamleyTimes> Pat confronts himself
[2:35:20] <+MeMillionthDollar> MORTIS
[2:35:21] <%Saltmeisterr> how does pat heal? by doing damage?
[2:35:21] <Man_in_the_Red> cmon Pat, this boss and 1 more stage
[2:35:23] <%Puhff> inb4 easy mode activate
[2:35:24] <MayorRev> fuck you laughing skeleton
[2:35:27] <%ShinobiPhoenix> so it's less and less reason for me to have it at launch except to say I have it
[2:35:32] <BlacSoul> now, does DMCV get an upgrade pass
[2:35:34] <Man_in_the_Red> @saltmeisterr blood
[2:35:34] <$RealThiele> better
[2:35:36] <FeltSn0wman> you heal by bathing the blood of your enemies
[2:35:38] <dakotachipmath> I swear to god it just says Cuck over and over again when you die. That's all I hear.
[2:35:38] <%BoxNavy> you heal by absorbing the blood of enemies
[2:35:39] <Louie_Salmon> Midnight might be a difficult time for a hardcore boomer shooter
[2:35:40] <rkytek> haha "Fuck"
[2:35:40] <%ShinobiPhoenix> who here got their pre-order in
[2:35:42] <Sol_Install> hideous mass is a strong name
[2:35:49] <%scottysunday> If you're close while shooting, blood refuel you
[2:35:50] <SourTortuga> don't like the feet on this guy
[2:35:53] <%Saltmeisterr> ah
[2:35:59] <AFlyingTaco1> @ShinobiPhoenix Pretty much just Pat
[2:36:09] <Rexus93> you can actually dash through the overcharged pump if you time it right
[2:36:14] <%ShinobiPhoenix> I didn't see or hear it DMCV upgraded for free, but I doubt it.
[2:36:15] <+skm742> @PatStaresAt The dash has full i-frames, helps for those radial pulses.
[2:36:17] <cobalt_phoenix_> i can't wait to see the crazy shit people do in this game
[2:36:26] <yottawhat> Move over V1 feet pics, gime some of those Hideous Mass's feeties.
[2:36:29] <%BoxNavy> i managed to get a ps5 as soon as the pre order page went live on amazon
[2:36:38] <%ShinobiPhoenix> since it's Special Edition vs regular.
[2:36:40] <AFlyingTaco1> When did this come out anyways?
[2:36:40] <dakotachipmath> You got this pat. I believe in you
[2:36:43] <FeltSn0wman> you mean like reflecting face explosions with a coin toss @cobalt_phoenix_
[2:36:43] <lazerscraper> @rexus93 iframes negates the lv4 self damage?
[2:36:56] <+Cobaltor_252> this things looks like a Bayo boss
[2:37:00] <cobalt_phoenix_> @FeltSn0wman wait what
[2:37:10] <Rexus93> @lazerscraper yes, all about timing though
[2:37:15] <FeltSn0wman> yeah literally the hardest piece of tech in the game
[2:37:16] <$RealThiele> lots of feast/famine
[2:37:21] <%ShinobiPhoenix> @BoxNavy did you use a link from twitter or something? I was there before midnight and there wasn't even a proper page up before the launch
[2:37:39] <%Saltmeisterr> nice
[2:37:40] <Grandma_Amari> YE YE YER
[2:37:42] <dakotachipmath> The blood effect just pouring out after a shotgun blast is rad. Wish more games had that comical ammounts of blood
[2:37:42] <Louie_Salmon> Yeah
[2:37:42] <+epoladia> pog
[2:37:42] <Cherokia666> yeet

[2:37:53] <%IncredibleMeh> youuuuuu did it
[2:37:54] <Rexus93> S
[2:37:56] <%BoxNavy> @ShinobiPhoenix yeah. i had to keep refreshing the link. mind you this was on amazon canada

[2:39:13] <mrlastchance1> more like ultrashill
[2:39:14] <%ShinobiPhoenix> I really really preferred not being forced to get the physical edition, it's almost like the sellers have an incentive to NOT sell you the device to keeps you from buying more games from them instead of Sony

[2:41:32] <greendragon111> that looks cool
[2:41:35] <+maybefalco> LITERALLY VERGIL
[2:41:35] <$floralkami> @xerosigmaprime well there is of course Evil Within, but i remember heAring it in-- FORGET THAT SHIT, heres V2??
[2:41:37] <AFlyingTaco1> Goddamn that bastard sniped your shit so hard
[2:41:38] <%BoxNavy> i was hoping youd get to this tonight
[2:41:40] <dunkle321> RIVAL BABY
[2:41:48] <%scottysunday> You're V1. He's V2
[2:41:48] <+Cobaltor_252> so this is the Vergil announcement everyones talking about
[2:41:51] <dakotachipmath> Who
[2:41:53] <%Valdorick> IT DEFLECTED YOUR COIN!?
[2:41:56] <Grandma_Amari> THIS IS SO COOL
[2:41:58] <lazerscraper> IS IT PARRYING YOUR SHOTS
[2:41:59] <%sleepers1mulant> the cooler newer you
[2:41:59] <Cherokia666> You'll meet your Vergil... this isn't him
[2:42:06] <%ShinobiPhoenix> even if I don't get the XBox, I decided that I AM getting Game Pass, for xCloud, that is too good of a deal
[2:42:07] <Grandma_Amari> IS IT DOING THE COIN TOO?!
[2:42:10] <$RealThiele> unrelenting
[2:42:15] <greendragon111> arena shooter?
[2:42:19] <MayorRev> he's got coin!
[2:42:29] <$floralkami> HE GOT COIN
[2:42:29] <cobalt_phoenix_> COIN USE
[2:42:31] <%Broand> Rage mode
[2:42:38] <+Vorga1339> if you run away too much he goes into rage mode
[2:42:39] <Grandma_Amari> HE GIVE COIN
[2:42:40] <AFlyingTaco1> Defeat your better self
[2:42:42] <%BoxNavy> hes coining you up
[2:42:42] <suikudo> wait can he shoot your coin?
[2:42:45] <Cherokia666> This fight was a rough one
[2:42:53] <dunkle321> Yes he can
[2:42:54] <polybious12> he hates cowwards
[2:42:57] <$RealThiele> aim too hard
[2:42:57] <$floralkami> @cherokia666 IT'S NOT?
[2:42:59] <%scottysunday> Get in close, blood is fuel!
[2:42:59] <%Valdorick> Can you parry his shots?
[2:43:12] <Louie_Salmon> Yeyeye the juggle
[2:43:12] <FeltSn0wman> yes
[2:43:13] <yottawhat> You can
[2:43:16] <FeltSn0wman> even the charge shot
[2:43:16] <%Saltmeisterr> You can parry him
[2:43:17] <Rexus93> shotty up close for heals
[2:43:20] <MayorRev> parry him!
[2:43:21] <stanlychicken> you can parry his shots
[2:43:22] <yottawhat> But they're practically hit scan
[2:43:24] <Cherokia666> @floralkami nope... it isn't
[2:43:31] <yottawhat> So it's really head.
[2:43:33] <Louie_Salmon> I love the way the fight starts, like a bouncy house
[2:43:35] <yottawhat> Hard
[2:43:37] <Grandma_Amari> This setting is so cool
[2:43:45] <T_Sasquatch> Can this game just come out on ps4 , ahhhhh
[2:43:45] <Man_in_the_Red> oh tip for the nail gun, they buffed it so you can send out magnets while firing
[2:43:50] <AFlyingTaco1> So is this the last boss?
[2:43:50] <FeltSn0wman> oh yeah you can juggle him
[2:43:52] <%sleepers1mulant> this is so FUCKING RAD
[2:44:00] <%Valdorick> oh, that's not great damage though.
[2:44:12] <FeltSn0wman> nope
[2:44:16] <FeltSn0wman> this is the second boss
[2:44:17] <dakotachipmath> This fight seems annoying tbh.
[2:44:17] <$floralkami> @cherokia666 is... is this as V is to actual Vergil?
[2:44:17] <MayorRev> We tech those
[2:44:21] <+Vorga1339> @AFlyingTaco1 nah son, last boss is even better
[2:44:23] <$RealThiele> yea but its reliable
[2:44:32] <Man_in_the_Red> hell, technically this is the first boss
[2:44:55] <Man_in_the_Red> ceberus and sword machine are normal enemies in cyber grind
[2:44:57] <+spacehouse> Cheer500 keep in mind most of the music in-game is also by the dev, bandcamp name is HeavenPierceHer
[2:45:01] <FeltSn0wman> you gotta get close and heal
[2:45:03] <%ShinobiPhoenix> is this a mandatory fight or did Pat choose the path of his own destruction?
[2:45:03] <$RealThiele> LUL hes always behind
[2:45:07] <$floralkami> fuckin..... first... boss??
[2:45:15] <Rexus93> this is mandatory
[2:45:16] <Cherokia666> @floralkami closer to a Creedo fight if anything. there's a literal Vergil much later
[2:45:16] <FeltSn0wman> so is hideous mass if you make it far enough
[2:45:23] <Rexus93> kill your upgrade
[2:45:33] <tolloponik> you can chain coins! PogChamp
[2:45:35] <Man_in_the_Red> shhh
[2:45:41] <Louie_Salmon> @floralkami You don't understand how Vergil it can get. This bot ain't even blue
[2:45:43] <$floralkami> MEGAMAN UPGRADES???
[2:45:44] <yottawhat> What difficult is Pat playing at?
[2:45:45] <%ShinobiPhoenix> I am so glad I don't play games to frustration anymore, too old to put that kind of stress on myself
[2:45:45] <%Saltmeisterr> parry him
[2:45:51] <+Ez3z> dont be do scared of dashing
[2:45:54] <+Vorga1339> @PatStaresAt if you coward too hard he enters rage mode
[2:45:56] <Man_in_the_Red> i never found a use for chaining coins but yeah its a thing
[2:45:56] <+Ez3z> use it all the time
[2:45:56] <%Saltmeisterr> yeah
[2:45:57] <+spacehouse> Get Close and DODGE
[2:45:59] <%AyotoCorp> Get in close so you can heal off of him
[2:46:01] <TheBadIdeaMan> Get up close and punch him to heal
[2:46:01] <Mnemonicjohnny> Charge shots are probably a good idea here -- you want fast hitscan.
[2:46:01] <+Pyroclase> You want to shoot the boss and don't get hit
[2:46:01] <MayorRev> You can parry him as well as your own shots
[2:46:03] <dunkle321> Pat dash more, and try landing more charge shots
[2:46:05] <polybious12> get in and stay in/
[2:46:06] <FeltSn0wman> you can parry like everything
[2:46:09] <+TylerRich117> Doom eternal flashbacks o the Marauder
[2:46:10] <Louie_Salmon> Dashing is good, chaingun is good, shotgun is good for heals
[2:46:16] <%scottysunday> Get motivated!
[2:46:20] <%Tunnelcakesrule> THIS GAME HAS A PARRY?
[2:46:20] <Man_in_the_Red> oh you know what, high altitude, 4th weapon shot
[2:46:20] <DianaTheAscian> yeyeye
[2:46:22] <%Valdorick> You can parry your own bullets - he's using your bullets - you can parry his bullets
[2:46:24] <%Tunnelcakesrule> so cool
[2:46:26] <Louie_Salmon> Nice
[2:46:29] <$floralkami> YEYEYEYEYEYE
[2:46:35] <+Vorga1339> @PatStaresAt also that coin noise you are hearing is a universal sound cue that an enemy is about to do something, it's important for later bosses
[2:46:39] <%scottysunday> the ding with the shine indicator, watch for it
[2:46:46] <Cici_TheMoonRabbit> Charged revolver shot is effective too
[2:46:59] <%Broand> Punch when he's in range too
[2:46:59] <MementoCaedes> tough game
[2:47:03] <%BoxNavy> him sliding i think
[2:47:11] <FeltSn0wman> helps to stay close for healing
[2:47:17] <lazerscraper> can you parry your bullet BACK at V2?
[2:47:22] <Louie_Salmon> Yeah it's like him getting ready to fire, it's kinda annoying it sounds so similar
[2:47:32] <$floralkami> it's a surprise tool that will help us later @patstaresat
[2:47:35] <$RealThiele> this is what i was expecting that last fight in Dusk to be like
[2:47:44] <MayorRev> keep at it!
[2:47:46] <Cherokia666> yeh, this is the fight where the dev is saying "I hope you've been using all the tools i gave you."
[2:47:47] <Mnemonicjohnny> My advice would be to dash more -- lateral movement is the only thing that'll dodge these shots.
[2:47:51] <%BoxNavy> YEEEEAH
[2:48:01] <%Broand> Get all up in his grits
[2:48:03] <redapache> Anybody know why his wings change color?
[2:48:10] <Louie_Salmon> Wait does parrying full-heal you?
[2:48:15] <TheBadIdeaMan> Pat your dash has I frames
[2:48:18] <yottawhat> yep
[2:48:18] <$RealThiele> i think his wings reflect his gun selected
[2:48:20] <FeltSn0wman> you cant stand still at all tbh
[2:48:31] <+dasmause> @Louie_Salmon hitting enemies does
[2:48:35] <Mnemonicjohnny> Yeah, each one's a different weapon -- blue is charge shot, yellow's coinshot, orange is shotty
[2:48:53] <+diabuddha> dash through after shotgun it'll heal pretty often
[2:49:05] <dakotachipmath> ResidentSleeper
[2:49:09] <T_Sasquatch> Bob and weave pat
[2:49:11] <Man_in_the_Red> you know, knowing when not to parry is sometimes... mostly more useful than parrying
[2:49:11] <FeltSn0wman> dash like all the time
[2:49:26] <lazerscraper> gotta really move it with the dashes
[2:49:27] <Louie_Salmon> I never parried V2, but this seems pretty good
[2:49:34] <redapache> Are we backseat gaming a bit much?
[2:49:37] <$Futurecity10> LIVE DIE REPEAT
[2:49:37] <$RealThiele> hes gotta know the parry timing tho to be able to do it at all on this guy
[2:49:37] <sakeydo> The death counter must be fun on this shit. Lol
[2:49:40] <+spacehouse> Stop Standing Still
[2:49:40] <yottawhat> Shit's hard man. He's not the Vergil character for nothing.
[2:49:40] <+Vorga1339> also parrying everything isn't the answer, it's a supplement to good shoots
[2:49:40] <Cherokia666> getting sleepy there, bub?
[2:49:44] <Man_in_the_Red> a bit, yeah
[2:49:46] <FeltSn0wman> this is a really hard boss tbh
[2:49:47] <+walternatorz> welp, after 2 hours and 45 minutes I was finally able to preorder PS5 through best buy
[2:49:49] <yottawhat> And yeah, parrying seems legit.
[2:49:58] <MayorRev> Yeah if you need a breather i wouldnt blame you
[2:49:59] <%BoxNavy> seems like people are gettin preorders through bestbuy rn
[2:50:00] <+Cobaltor_252> you can cheese him with the nail gun pretty easily if you can track his jumps
[2:50:00] <Louie_Salmon> I assume Pat would be like "hey shut up" if he didn't want tech
[2:50:03] <+dasmause> you can explore other limbo levels to open that door for now
[2:50:03] <MayorRev> tiring sometimes
[2:50:04] <%Broand> I beat him without parrying him once
[2:50:05] <Man_in_the_Red> V2 on no sleep is real tough
[2:50:05] <Rexus93> do a round of cybergrind
[2:50:05] <@SoFarFetched> now pat needs to check how many pre-orders he can get.
[2:50:06] <lazerscraper> dash harder, stay in the air
[2:50:11] <+spacehouse> SSS =Stop Standing Still
[2:50:12] <dunkle321> Parrying ain't the best idea
[2:50:14] <FeltSn0wman> if you can pull it off yeah
[2:50:16] <AFlyingTaco1> Wait how did V2 take damage there
[2:50:17] <MayorRev> SHOW THAT SKELETON WHOS BOSS
[2:50:21] <$RealThiele> Scalp those consoles boys
[2:50:28] <redapache> Maybe try sticking to pistol only, getting meatshots with shotty is not very consistent
[2:50:31] <+Vorga1339> also always punch shoot is pretty good, make the bullets go faster
[2:50:32] <lazerscraper> revolver more at a distance, shotty close
[2:50:34] <%ShinobiPhoenix> @walternatorz really, nice, congrats. I didn't see any digital editions anytimes I tried Best Buy, so I gave up on them
[2:50:39] <lazerscraper> play marvel
[2:50:57] <FeltSn0wman> if you run away he gets pitssed
[2:51:04] <+RetroGiinthir> Just use a controller coward
[2:51:04] <Louie_Salmon> Yeah if you stay away from him he hates it
[2:51:08] <%BoxNavy> does anyone know how much storage is on the ps5 anyway?
[2:51:20] <%BoxNavy> hopefully at least a terabyte
[2:51:22] <$RealThiele> if no controller setting use DS4windows
[2:51:24] <redapache> good question
[2:51:25] <+walternatorz> @walternatorz I went with the disc version, I don't know if it made a difference
[2:51:27] <AFlyingTaco1> @walternatorz How did you manage to get your cart working?
[2:51:37] <Man_in_the_Red> @boxnavy too little considering next gen games run 200GB or more LUL
[2:51:38] <Vaxidd8> Damn this game is sick
[2:51:48] <FeltSn0wman> you can destory those pillars with explosives
[2:51:56] <%BoxNavy> @Man_in_the_Red moon2W youre right...
[2:51:57] <Man_in_the_Red> whats COD's requirements at now
[2:52:01] <+walternatorz> @AFlyingTaco1 I first tried using credit card but switched to paypal and kept attempting to place order
[2:52:13] <Mnemonicjohnny> when it doubt, multi-pump shotgun.
[2:52:19] <%sleepers1mulant> @Man_in_the_Red well over 250gb now
[2:52:26] <Cypher_Ranger_PhazON> how much we bettin pat stops here for the night?
[2:52:29] <%Saltmeisterr> parrying his charge shot seems ideal
[2:52:33] <%BoxNavy> WutFace over 250
[2:52:34] <Man_in_the_Red> see
[2:52:36] <+Vorga1339> this is where the real boomer chops come in
[2:52:38] <+Vorga1339> channel the redbull
[2:52:44] <%ShinobiPhoenix> @walternatorz It's almost like everyone is making it HARDER to buy the digital edition
[2:52:57] <$RealThiele> the paypal going through worked but also said available on OR after the release date
[2:53:00] <%ShinobiPhoenix> you would think the physical edition would be harder because everyone wants it
[2:53:02] <AFlyingTaco1> @Man_in_the_Red On my PS4 it's at about 193GB
[2:53:05] <+walternatorz> @AFlyingTaco1 spent 2 hours trying credit card, spent 45 mins with paypal, but it did clear out my cart a number of times
[2:53:08] <+sw3gj3w> holy shit caught a moment of the best buy site working and ps5 order worked
[2:53:09] <%BoxNavy> the biggest game i have installed on my pc is mhw
[2:53:26] <Man_in_the_Red> Western companies dont know what compression is, anyone else remember Pokemon silver cramming 2 games in a cart smaller than a spreadsheet file
[2:53:37] <Cherokia666> After a while on this fight i just start "feeling out" his moves. It took me a long time too and there's probably a shorter way
[2:53:40] <dakotachipmath> Why does he do this to himself? lol
[2:53:41] <Mnemonicjohnny> Pat's slowly getting more STYLISH
[2:53:49] <+aWanderingKaivo> gotta use that middle out compression
[2:53:49] <whittacre> !uptime
[2:53:49] <@Moobot> I've been playing this game for how long? Oh only 2h 53m.
[2:53:59] <%DensityD> late night Pat stares at
[2:54:01] <greendragon111> dmc style in you head
[2:54:08] <%ShinobiPhoenix> right now, I am going through the Game Pass list to see what I realistically would want to play if I did get an Xbox, I will say Monster Hunter World for free would be nice
[2:54:08] <%DensityD> V2: your videogame stream
[2:54:09] <AFlyingTaco1> @AFlyingTaco1 Huh, I can't even get past adding the preorder to my cart
[2:54:13] <$RealThiele> late night without the Furry Barge
[2:54:18] <%DensityD> vidyavidya: V2
[2:54:28] <%BoxNavy> sheesh
[2:54:34] <%DensityD> furry barge = plague?
[2:54:34] <FeltSn0wman> you can charge shot coins to guarantee they hit
[2:54:40] <Mnemonicjohnny> better get used to quickswapping between revolver and shotty
[2:54:50] <%Broand> what was that?
[2:54:56] <dakotachipmath> I'd bet money he stops at this boss or after beating it on the 100th try lolo
[2:54:56] <+Vorga1339> and now we've moved to cheating
[2:54:57] <+Vorga1339> lel
[2:55:00] <MayorRev> weapon wheel lol
[2:55:03] <$RealThiele> furry barge is all thats left for pat and paige, eli welcomes them onboard
[2:55:04] <Lightraven_> lol
[2:55:06] <Louie_Salmon> Yeah cheese it
[2:55:06] <MayorRev> C H E E S E
[2:55:08] <Rexus93> dio shit lmao
[2:55:09] <%DensityD> so when does V3 come in and it's Grace and Glory?
[2:55:09] <greendragon111> Don't worry!
[2:55:14] <+Vorga1339> there are assists in the options if you want to slow the game down old man
[2:55:16] <Louie_Salmon> CHOESE
[2:55:22] <MayorRev> umm if its cheating then why is it in the game Kappa
[2:55:29] <+walternatorz> @AFlyingTaco1 try selecting from a bundle if it's not working for you, you can remove items from your cart as well
[2:55:32] <$xXRealGamerThaigeXx> maybe try the nailgun?
[2:55:40] <%sleepers1mulant> not even a quarter health gone
[2:55:41] <Mnemonicjohnny> Keep the faith, mang
[2:55:44] <%Broand> I didn't even know there is a weapon wheel
[2:55:47] <FeltSn0wman> yeah the nailgun is real solid bc you dont have to track
[2:55:48] <MayorRev> nailgun got some good chip damage in
[2:56:05] <Louie_Salmon> Sticking them switching to burst is pretty strong
[2:56:05] <%TheActuallyGuy> YO i got my PS5 on Best Buy. the website seems to be working again.
[2:56:10] <+walternatorz> @AFlyingTaco1 I don't know if it made a difference, but I selected the disc +1 controller bundle
[2:56:19] <FeltSn0wman> tag him with the nail as he jumps in
[2:56:21] <%BoxNavy> EVERYONE GO TO BESTBUY RIGHT NOW
[2:56:23] <%BoxNavy> GO
[2:56:25] <MayorRev> imma get food
[2:56:26] <+Vorga1339> if pat can stick a nail and then unload an overheat into him it would probably take a quarter of his health
[2:56:33] <Louie_Salmon> It's also pretty good to just have the magnets in the center, and let him dash through the swarm
[2:56:36] <+Kingtut9009> PAt late stream?
[2:56:41] <MayorRev> best buy is closed
[2:56:41] <%TheActuallyGuy> both digital and disc were available.
[2:56:43] <MayorRev> its 3 am
[2:56:46] <Cherokia666> I'm not buying one yet, so i'm good
[2:56:54] <%ShinobiPhoenix> @walternatorz yeah, I saw they had a number of overpriced upsell bundles, that was another reason I skipped out on them
[2:56:55] <Louie_Salmon> Sometimes he'll just take insane damage moving into a swarm of them on the ground
[2:56:57] <+Vorga1339> assist
[2:56:59] <Lightraven_> Assists are cheats
[2:57:02] <Cici_TheMoonRabbit> OH NO
[2:57:04] <%BoxNavy> do a huge cheat
[2:57:06] <UnfilteredComic> Dont do it
[2:57:07] <%XeroSigmaPrime> NO
[2:57:07] <$xXRealGamerThaigeXx> big cheats
[2:57:10] <%XeroSigmaPrime> STOP YOU FUCK
[2:57:12] <Louie_Salmon> BIG CHEATS
[2:57:12] <FeltSn0wman> lmao
[2:57:12] <%BoxNavy> YEEEEAH moon2CD
[2:57:17] <%sleepers1mulant> choese
[2:57:18] <dunkle321> ITEM USER
[2:57:18] <+maybefalco> actual coward
[2:57:19] <%ShinobiPhoenix> I just wanted to get the console, I definitely don't need two controllers right now and I defintely don't need to buy a game
[2:57:19] <$RealThiele> yea big cheats
[2:57:24] <FeltSn0wman> silhouettes are good tho
[2:57:25] <%XeroSigmaPrime> YOU WERE SUPPOSED TO DESTROY THE SITH
[2:57:26] <%BoxNavy> the cheats made it harder
[2:57:27] <yottawhat> Oh neat, there's an animation for the auto-aim.
[2:57:27] <+Vorga1339> turn on major assists if you want to big cheat
[2:57:27] <TheBadIdeaMan> Good.
[2:57:30] <FeltSn0wman> most ppl use them tbh
[2:57:30] <%XeroSigmaPrime> NOT JOIN THEM
[2:57:35] <+AtlasMcCoy> You cheated not only the game, but yourself
[2:57:37] <+crazyspartan214> SHAMFUR DISPRAY!
[2:57:40] <%Saltmeisterr> silhouettes seem good
[2:57:45] <Zaphire_Saucypants> cheat away
[2:57:46] <Louie_Salmon> The auto-aim also makes using coins way harder
[2:57:46] <%BinaryFireball> ULTRA KILL
[2:57:48] <%CommanderSqueaks> Oh he's at Vergil
[2:57:54] <+walternatorz> @ShinobiPhoenix each item is added to your cart individually from the bundle I selected. you likely can remove the items you don't want from the cart, but that's thinking normal stuff still works
[2:57:56] <Zaphire_Saucypants> cheat harder
[2:58:11] <%TheActuallyGuy> @shinobiphoenix my order just went through on best buy's website. just the console. no bundle. i got the digital version.
[2:58:12] <%Broand> V2 is red, violence is delectable, you are dead, easy mode is now selectable
[2:58:33] <Man_in_the_Red> i dont think they patched in easy yet
[2:58:42] <Mnemonicjohnny> He hates it when you run away.
[2:58:46] <TheBadIdeaMan> He hates COWARDS
[2:58:49] <%Saltmeisterr> id say keep doing what ur doing and try to parry his charage shot
[2:58:59] <+Vorga1339> this is a joust, not a game of tag
[2:59:12] <%BinaryFireball> is this a boss?
[2:59:22] <%scottysunday> remember the minimum overheat does BIG damage
[2:59:23] <%BinaryFireball> nvm I am just really dumb
[2:59:24] <+aWanderingKaivo> coin seems the most reliable
[2:59:25] <stanlychicken> nah
[2:59:26] <Lightraven_> Yeah
[2:59:31] <FeltSn0wman> the easiest way to die here is to run away
[2:59:32] <%scottysunday> ^minigun
[2:59:33] <%BinaryFireball> because today I am a big dumbdumb
[2:59:34] <AFlyingTaco1> @ShinobiPhoenix Well, I don't know how, but it decided to just work for some reason this time, and it said the order was placed.
[2:59:34] <greendragon111> can't wait to fight this guy
[2:59:39] <FeltSn0wman> you lose healing and piss him off
[3:00:31] <%XeroSigmaPrime> I only want the PS5 Physical is for my physical copy of FF7 Remake :(
[3:00:35] <+walternatorz> @ShinobiPhoenix Congrats!
[3:00:36] <%BinaryFireball> what difficulty is he on?
[3:00:40] <Louie_Salmon> And that's where me story ends
[3:00:41] <%BinaryFireball> hard?
[3:00:45] <+spacehouse> Not on a CONTROLLER
[3:00:48] <%AyotoCorp> Try using the charge pistol more
[3:00:51] <stanlychicken> melee along with your shotgun shots for more heal and damage
[3:00:52] <Mnemonicjohnny> As dumb as this sounds, you really just need to get better at shooting him
[3:00:57] <+Ez3z> this is standard difficulty
[3:00:58] <%scottysunday> Standard
[3:00:58] <FeltSn0wman> explosives are good from range, and stay close for healing a lot
[3:01:00] <+diabuddha> be more aggressive. you gain back health more
[3:01:09] <+dasmause> if you feel like giving up, explore 1-1 and 1-2 to open that bigass gate, it might help
[3:01:11] <greendragon111> can he heal or are there no items to heal with?
[3:01:12] <Man_in_the_Red> theres regular and violent, the actual hard modes arent in yet (?)
[3:01:17] <Manwad> can you punch back his bullets?
[3:01:24] <$RealThiele> this is where if you havent gotten used to feast/famine you die
[3:01:37] <Lightraven_> @greendragon111 You heal from close range damage
[3:01:50] <+OROSONA> my expert analysis says you arent hitting him enough
[3:01:51] <$xXRealGamerThaigeXx> I feel like if you land the magnet shot this fight might be alot easier
[3:01:53] <+diabuddha> don't be afraid to punch him too. that's health
[3:01:57] <Man_in_the_Red> Blood is Fuel
[3:01:59] <FirewallStorm> the charged up blue shot is probably the easiest to pairy
[3:02:00] <FirewallStorm> you can always see it coming
[3:02:11] <FeltSn0wman> also worth noting that V2 can only dash while in the air so juggling him is p free
[3:02:12] <+ThemDubs> thats working
[3:02:13] <tolloponik> this isn't a ranged battle it's a knife fight
[3:02:16] <%Ranryu692> yesss my preorder just went through with Best Buy
[3:02:17] <greendragon111> @greendragon111 oh, ok thaks :)
[3:02:19] <greendragon111> oh, ok thanks
[3:02:20] <Man_in_the_Red> he found the strat
[3:02:27] <Mnemonicjohnny> Alright, the sliding shotgun jousting is sick as shit
[3:02:31] <Louie_Salmon> Yeah this is what I did, jousting
[3:02:44] <%Reveresao> PS5 SECURED Kreygasm
[3:03:03] <Cherokia666> Yeah, getting into his face is a good strat
[3:03:09] <%BoxNavy> monkaS
[3:03:16] <+aWanderingKaivo> nice
[3:03:18] <%angel949> "Jusy do it Pat it'll be easy"- Paige probably
[3:03:22] <Man_in_the_Red> pre 4th weapon, jousting is the only real feasible way of taking V2 on
[3:03:27] <DrGasMax> Has he been punching the bullets?
[3:03:31] <+Vorga1339> he's getting it
[3:03:39] <greendragon111> this feels like fighting break man for the first time in MM3
[3:03:46] <%BoxNavy> you have a strat at least
[3:03:46] <Louie_Salmon> He tried parrying, this seems more consistent
[3:03:58] <RantingRavager> Two robots fighting shirtless in the rain
[3:04:00] <DrGasMax> I mean punching his OWN bullets
[3:04:04] <lazerscraper> does his attacks get faster in phases?
[3:04:05] <%ShinobiPhoenix> hey, I don't see an option on Best Buy site to enter PayPal?
[3:04:16] <FeltSn0wman> you can fire the shotgun faster by swapping between the two modes after each shot
[3:04:26] <Louie_Salmon> @drgasmax Oh yeah he knows about the shotgun parry
[3:04:30] <+rottingpastry> Gotta click the Paypal Checkout button
[3:04:36] <DrGasMax> good good
[3:04:40] <dakotachipmath> Is he trying new things or just stubbornly throwing himself at it while making no more then 10% progress on the HP bar every time? I'm only half watching at this point.
[3:04:43] <+rottingpastry> As someone who just spent hours pounding it, I feel your pain
[3:04:55] <greendragon111> I just bought it on steam
[3:05:07] <FeltSn0wman> good this game is nuts
[3:05:10] <%ShinobiPhoenix> @rottingpastry so it's not under the saved Payment Methods section? i am making an account from scratch
[3:05:13] <DrGasMax> Not punching bullets in this feels like not countering in a platinum game to me
[3:05:17] <Mnemonicjohnny> One other thing you might wanna try is dashing through and shooting at the same time -- iframes are nice.
[3:05:19] <%Divryne> Divryne subscribed at Tier 1. They've subscribed for 26 months, currently on a 26 month streak! Hey Pat. Do you think the whole DMC5 SE shit with PC is just some launch exclusivity thing or do you think it's the whole DmC: DMC SE situation?
[3:05:26] <greendragon111> DMC but Quake
[3:05:29] <%sleepers1mulant> now you're getting somewhere
[3:05:38] <$xXRealGamerThaigeXx> big hard

[3:05:48] <tolloponik> stream OVer/
[3:05:48] <DKDiamantes> Theres no shame in that jesus
[3:05:53] <dakotachipmath> lol
[3:05:54] <Louie_Salmon> Big kills, very ultra
[3:05:55] <FeltSn0wman> i think u can slam to launch him up and juggle him
[3:05:56] <Mnemonicjohnny> Yeah, aim seemed a bit fucky
[3:05:59] <+Vorga1339> weak blood
[3:06:00] <faithless_zealot> I'm honestly surprised you made it that far
[3:06:00] <DianaTheAscian> yes
[3:06:01] <%BoxNavy> i did :)
[3:06:01] <Cherokia666> It's late. I had to put it down for a night after that
[3:06:01] <%medusasghost> sleep time pat
[3:06:03] <DrGasMax> I caught 3 minutes of it
[3:06:04] <%scottysunday> Devil May Quake

[3:06:27] <%AdamElJefe> A STOLEN, AMERICAN PS5
[3:06:28] <%SirGO0SE> psaUp
[3:06:28] <DKDiamantes> So obvious
[3:06:28] <+dayz1003> how soon are you gonna go to scumbag tactics?
[3:06:30] <dakotachipmath> This fight definitely makes me never want touch the game.
[3:06:30] <DrGasMax> why not
[3:06:30] <+ThemDubs> why not 5
[3:06:33] <%king_wragles> Pat that's not... ya know what? You do it
[3:06:34] <+RetroGiinthir> Two robots fighting over Blood in Hell. Raddest thing all year
[3:06:34] <Man_in_the_Red> what if he needs it later
[3:06:35] <+ThemDubs> since it is the ps5
