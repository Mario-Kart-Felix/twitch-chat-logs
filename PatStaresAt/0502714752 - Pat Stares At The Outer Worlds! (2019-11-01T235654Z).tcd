[0:16:55] <Zaphire_Saucypants> the memory of a consumer
[0:16:55] <%NovaKnightmare> OW2 is just a premium OW event
[0:16:56] <%mh9s> who needs rights when we have VIDEO GAMESSSSSSSSS
[0:16:57] <%Hobojo153> Burn them
[0:17:02] <%XeroSigmaPrime> @AngriestPat Yo, we banning Death Stranding spoilers? I dont wanna get spoiled by looking at chat. Should I close chat for this next wekk?
[0:17:03] <+JamesCorck> Pat, the Blizzcon audience is made out of sycophantic fans.
[0:17:03] <%Hobojo153> That's what it needed
[0:17:07] <+Nomicro4u> I CLAPPED WHEN I SAW IT
[0:17:07] <%Hobojo153> It needed more burning
[0:17:07] <BurningLlama777> "We moved too fast." Scumbags.
[0:17:09] <%AncelDeLambert> these people need to expect better
[0:17:09] <%Madbearv> People weak af if they changed their tune after going "STAND TOGETHER"
[0:17:09] <%JGardner88> Wherabouts is Pat on Outer Worlds?
[0:17:12] <Heartless_01> consumers gotta consume
[0:17:13] <Dementedpenguin> I was disappointed at how QUICKLY the audience clapped after the "apology"
[0:17:14] <+AllenDeadman> eople just being spiteful
[0:17:15] <+JamesCorck> It's likely their sales aren't going to be that spectacular.
[0:17:16] <crazypieman7> Amazing to me that there is pretty much no reason to buy overwatch 2
[0:17:17] <%rumtumtugnutz> You can tell certain influencers have been asked to promote Diablo 4.
[0:17:17] <%PatchworkSquid> STAHP I KNOW IM WEAK. . . .but that Diablo 4. .
[0:17:18] <%honeyman18> nice, cringe apology meme videos comming then
[0:17:18] <BurningLlama777> "We're sad we got called out."
[0:17:19] <%cvp5127> "we're sorry"
[0:17:20] <Ion_Laser> That Blizzard "apology" was pathetic
[0:17:22] <bloodlusthonour> @AngriestPat Mother is better than red bull. fight me
[0:17:28] <+JamesCorck> That was a non-apology.
[0:17:30] <+gustavozxd> no Pat, it was such a good apology he looked so sad
[0:17:33] <WillyFresh992> We're sorry we werent clear enough of how much we suck chinas dick
[0:17:35] <%NovaKnightmare> @AngriestPat you gonna stream it solo or do something with Woolie?
[0:17:36] <BurningLlama777> "We're sorry you got offended"
[0:17:37] <Monkeyweed21> How's Outer Wilds Pat?
[0:17:37] <mercado94> """"""apology """"""""
[0:17:38] <+JamesCorck> Oh it's embarrassing.

[0:24:06] <ghostfrom3rdstrike_> I'd rather pay 60 for Overwatch 2 than Death Walking ANYDAY c805Hmm c805Hmm
[0:24:07] <%Dr_DangerPhD> it's not even really a sequel, it's just the PVE mode people have wanted since launch repackaged

[0:25:52] <%Captainahab_37> hey everybody!
[0:25:53] <MartinHadAMeme01> You're paying for the co-op and the bad "story" missions when you buy Overwatch 2. They said that it will be the same PVP as 1, and all new characters will cross over
[0:25:55] <%RubberFistFight> @XeroSigmaPrime they're only doing that for the clicks. Companies aren't your friends OR on your side, don't let them fool you. If it profited them to do so they'd throw you under the bus in a heartbeat.
[0:25:55] <%Yakobro> @Rngiddion that's SMN LUL
[0:25:57] <BurningLlama777> I'd like to visit an allergy cafe

[0:26:15] <%AncelDeLambert> this game is starting to slow down for me, I'm having trouble keeping a play session going for more than two hours

[0:27:02] <%NovaKnightmare> Malibu Stacy HAS A NEW HAT????
[0:27:03] <%Captainahab_37> I hope this game has gross monsters
[0:27:06] <%AncelDeLambert> OMG genji has neon lights on his JACKET for some reason, must buy!

[0:27:28] <%RubberFistFight> @XeroSigmaPrime so in other words, it works on you, because you're the kind of people they target with the "blizzard bad amirite?" rhetoric.

[0:29:24] <%Yakobro> MEEEEE
[0:29:26] <ScreamLord> @AngriestPat You know what makes Overwatch 2 even more egregious? I'll bet a billion dollars that all of the skins and such people earned/bought for OW1 won't be ported over. There for wasting thousands of people's money
[0:29:35] <zamzoph> When is Pat NOT sleepy? Kappa

[0:29:53] <%Piemen99> @Captainahab_37 one more week grace period
[0:29:56] <TechDragon_Z> @ScreamLord I believe that addressed that and said that everything carries over. So there's that at least.
[0:29:56] <%bread_assassin> Maybe streaming to 5AM wasn't the best move.
[0:30:01] <SomersaultJustice> they already confirmed overwatch 1 cosmetics will port over
[0:30:01] <j64mind> can you just hold the slow button?
[0:30:02] <Ion_Laser> @bomfiz yeah

[0:30:22] <Flickerember> @BurningLlama777 We can catch up together at Pats big numbers show
[0:30:23] <%Captainahab_37> overwatch 2 for some reason
[0:30:24] <bomfiz> @Ion_Laser what did he say?
[0:30:25] <bloodlusthonour> outer worlds
[0:30:25] <+Deadbulky> PERFECR
[0:30:26] <TechDragon_Z> He can read, he just can't see bombs.
[0:30:29] <MartinHadAMeme01> @ScreamLord they already said that multiplayer stuff carries over, because 2 is just co-op missions. there's no new multiplayer PVP component.
[0:30:32] <BurningLlama777> @Flickerember *high fives*
[0:30:45] <%XeroSigmaPrime> @Alchemystee Did you like Skyrim or God Of War more?

[0:31:09] <%XeroSigmaPrime> @Alchemystee Skyrim, go for Outer Worlds. God of War, go for Death Stranding
[0:31:09] <ScreamLord> @TechDragon_Z I'm honestly surprised they even thought about it, much less are porting stuff over
[0:31:10] <bloodlusthonour> moon moon
[0:31:23] <Alchemystee> @XeroSigmaPrime hmm that's interesting thank u!

[0:32:09] <TechDragon_Z> SAM is OP. Even on Supernova he never dies for me while everyone else is made of papermache.
[0:32:20] <Ion_Laser> @bomfiz He talked a little bit about Overwatch 2 and Diablo IV being announced to take people's minds off of the Blizzcon protest. Thought the "apology" that was given today was crap
[0:32:22] <%Enz0ned> Pat, you need to tinker with your stuff at workbench. it will improve you armor and guns for cash. first levels cost nothing
[0:32:25] <+Deadbulky> I got a game breaking bug where anton wont let me turn in his quest and vinises
[0:32:26] <Flickerember> @AngriestPat Are there a good amount of shootbangs and shootbang accessories cause going off FNV hype and missed stuff
[0:32:33] <+Deadbulky> Rip my save file
[0:32:40] <%InugamiTheHound> yeah I just spent 3 hours on the outer worlds. Its so much fun. I just got planet with evil raptor monsters

[0:32:57] <%MightyMaxT> What is the game breaking stuff?
[0:32:58] <+Deadbulky> Only worth tinkering like 2-3 levels
[0:32:58] <%honeyman18> Tinker if you wanna boost or whatever.
[0:33:03] <LostCire> legs so brittle
[0:33:08] <MartinHadAMeme01> Comparing god of war to death stranding is dumb. God of War is really condensed and linear for the most part, and every bit feels built by hand. Death Stranding is being compared to a sandbox. You're dropped into a big empty world of nothing and told to go there and you'll see a cool cutscene.
[0:33:09] <Ion_Laser> Fuck your knees and your legs
[0:33:10] <%PlainSimpleTailor> I only got in 5 minutes. Should I wait for the patch that probably won't happen?
[0:33:15] <Alchemystee> @XeroSigmaPrime haha ye i get that, but good enough of comparison for some lost fuck like me ^^
[0:33:16] <Zaphire_Saucypants> starting out
[0:33:16] <%XeroSigmaPrime> Why upgrade stuff when you get better stuff 5 minutes later
[0:33:22] <TechDragon_Z> Tinkering costs money. Are you paying the workbench? Does the workbench have employee benefits?
[0:33:23] <%XeroSigmaPrime> @Alchemystee <3\
[0:33:27] <j64mind> here is what i wonder pat: the scars of OMIKRON still hurt?
[0:33:33] <%SGrim> Also there's an infinite money exploit, so if you're gonna bitch, but break the economy.
[0:33:39] <%King_Wolf_Rigger> @MartinHadAMeme01 I like both
[0:33:41] <%Ner234> stroke
[0:33:43] <%honeyman18> You'll get tier 2-3 versions later and replace them anyway. Just don't go nuts with upgrades.

[0:34:09] <trueherobappo> @AngriestPat Oh, Have you thought about streaming any Fallout 4? I don't know if you've spoken about it recently but I'm just a bit curious..

[0:34:29] <Naho_Saenoki> "This is not a petunia"
[0:34:33] <MartinHadAMeme01> i like how this game has no lockpick minigame. you just hold and you either have enough skill and equipment or you don't.

[0:35:09] <%BillyMaze> Moon Gang emote when?
[0:35:13] <Flickerember> I dont mind lockpicking games but my inner loot whore would hate not being like if I am gewd I can never spend picks
[0:35:14] <%CrabSlacks> moon gang are the ones whom we can depend!
[0:35:14] <%SvenHolgersson> Like a whole bunch
[0:35:23] <TechDragon_Z> Pat there's bombs on Roseway.
[0:35:26] <%XeroSigmaPrime> Nah, let ADA fuck SAM
[0:35:35] <MartinHadAMeme01> Roseway was a fun planet.
[0:35:35] <BurningLlama777> @Flickerember Agreed. I think I broke like 2 lockpicks in Fallout 4
[0:35:40] <trueherobappo> @AngriestPat Every level up you need to say/yell Moon Gang with a lot of oomf
[0:35:50] <+Deadbulky> Watch out for the doom that came to roseway, Safe often, that quest can break with a bug
[0:35:52] <LostCire> I dunno vending machines are everywhere
[0:35:52] <BurningLlama777> Vodka, woooo!
[0:35:59] <Gieron667> @AngriestPat sorting quests by "location" makes it way easier figuring out what to do
[0:35:59] <%XeroSigmaPrime> Redheads are disgusting, right Pat?
[0:36:03] <%linSP> linSP subscribed at Tier 1. They've subscribed for 2 months! this game gives me a case of the gobbos
[0:36:03] <cureneckbeard> oh pat fixed the robit
[0:36:10] <LostCire> true
[0:36:10] <BurningLlama777> Do the vending machines have vodka
[0:36:12] <%RubberFistFight> Just watched the new WoW trailer. Hahahah get fucked Blizzard. Sylvanas is just Mary Sue Godmode now.
[0:36:19] <%RubberFistFight> So much bullshit in that cinematic.
[0:36:20] <SilverJakler> hi all
[0:36:26] <%AncelDeLambert> sell CHEMICALS
[0:36:30] <TechDragon_Z> If you have high enough engineering you can repair stuff on your on.
[0:36:33] <BurningLlama777> Hey @SilverJakler !
[0:36:43] <%Typhaeon> "Better than Ninja"
[0:36:48] <MartinHadAMeme01> Having beat this game, I think it falters a bit after Roseway. The third last planet is too big imo, and the second last planet feels unfinished, and the last planet is just plain bad.
[0:36:51] <BurningLlama777> Bioshock vibes from these machines
[0:36:55] <%RubberFistFight> Can't wait to see the apologists spin that bullshit.
[0:37:07] <Kisiel250> @AngriestPat drop the mods in your ships locker, they weight a ton
[0:37:10] <%BillyMaze> Pat did you buy this game on windows or Epic?
[0:37:11] <Gieron667> didnt you know the Litch king was a bitch ? sylvanas strong woman
[0:37:23] <BurningLlama777> @RubberFistFight "Sorry you can't *appreciate* the taste of boot leather, pleb! lol"
[0:37:30] <%Yakobro> @RubberFistFight watch her be doing it for "the greater good" by the end of the expansion :p
[0:37:31] <TechDragon_Z> Is your engineering high enough to repair things on your own? Think you just need it at 20.
[0:37:32] <ScreamLord> @AngriestPat I think Retro-Future is my favorite kind of Scifi setting.
[0:37:38] <Junkles> pat finally found the weight problem PogChamp
[0:37:42] <+theactualjimbo> I've started playing FF14 while watching streams. This is your fault

[0:37:48] <LostCire> Box!?
[0:37:57] <%AncelDeLambert> you ARE the problem
[0:37:58] <@Moobot> Hey, if you guys feel like checking out The Outer Worlds on account of this stream or cause you think I'm cool, go ahead and use this link https://bit.ly/2JmpB3Q to grab it off Greenman Gaming, and I'll get a few bucks kicked back. Thanks!
[0:37:59] <%SvenHolgersson> Sounds about right
[0:38:05] <%CrabSlacks> this game seems to have an anti-scampering and climbing agenda that I don't cotton to
[0:38:06] <%DracaenaLeaf> lins?
[0:38:06] <%AncelDeLambert> How dare you, Pat.
[0:38:10] <SolverCODO> goblins you fool
[0:38:11] <%linSP> apatGoblin
[0:38:11] <+AllenDeadman> mind goblins
[0:38:11] <$PaleBloodInk> Gobbos = Goblins.
[0:38:11] <+Deadbulky> MindGoblins
[0:38:12] <ScreamLord> Gobolins

[0:38:15] <TechDragon_Z> You can kill the cows.
[0:38:15] <+theactualjimbo> It's a good problem
[0:38:16] <%goose_attack_almanac> apatGoblin
[0:38:17] <%XeroSigmaPrime> FIREFLY REFERENCE
[0:38:17] <%Bailey__gaming> Hey Everyone wondering does anyone know if Paiges spooky scary skeletons song is available anywhere?
[0:38:18] <BurningLlama777> Apologies, I'm out of the loop on this game: Were some of the team members former Bioshock devs?
[0:38:22] <fearhurst> in bed with mind goblins
[0:38:23] <BunnyEmperor> moooo
[0:38:25] <mayorrev> goblins
[0:38:29] <1matheuw> that looks like a bug
[0:38:33] <%goose_attack_almanac> parvati is quite delicious.
[0:38:34] <NeroInfinite> I too also blame pat for having me play FF14 during streams...even though I started playing well before him.
[0:38:35] <%AncelDeLambert> wait WHAT
[0:38:36] <%Yakobro> LOL
[0:38:36] <%MrBorisMakarov> what
[0:38:37] <%DracaenaLeaf> let's see it
[0:38:39] <gekizenbu> yep!
[0:38:40] <%crimsonharvest> no big loss imo
[0:38:41] <LostCire> huh weird
[0:38:44] <%RubberFistFight> @Gieron667 yeah, you know how that helmet was forged by the burning legion itself, and it took 25 people to beat the LK and it didn't even actually work without a deus ex machina asspull because he'd planned that shit? Yeah never mind, Now Sylvanas "God Mode" Windrunner can just 1v1 him, fucking TAKE the helmet, and then just snap it like a twig.
[0:38:44] <%linSP> parvati died on the way to her home planet
[0:38:47] <Gieron667> ADA hasent said that line to me not a single time, meanwhile she says that to you EVERY TIME @AngriestPat
[0:38:48] <%TheTakkster> Don't lewd the parvati
[0:38:52] <%CrabSlacks> I think that's a story in the bible
[0:38:54] <%AncelDeLambert> that yo box
[0:38:58] <Virokwet> happened to me last time i played. freaked me out
[0:39:04] <Flickerember> Ending E to Snake Eater
[0:39:05] <TechDragon_Z> That's yo box. Can also use the lockers near the entrance.
[0:39:06] <+Buzzkill983> My Bin, My plastic Bin
[0:39:07] <Flickerember> Snake climbs to space
[0:39:13] <%TheTakkster> @AngriestPat keep mods in the lockers near your workbench
[0:39:18] <+CanonHusbando> you have to pay 100 bucks a year for it and it eats your mods
[0:39:20] <Gieron667> @RubberFistFight shhh it's 2019 means man is bitch and woman is the best
[0:39:22] <%RubberFistFight> @Yakobro something something MORALLY GREY something PLZ RESUB
[0:39:25] <+theactualjimbo> The ship's hold looks a lot like the one in Firefly...
[0:39:27] <Teyaric> That is too many moon heads.
[0:39:30] <MartinHadAMeme01> They already said that Sylvanas is being "influenced" by the big bad thing from the gameplay showcase for the explansion. Blizzard loves doing their "good protag is controlled by evil, and has to die and make you feel a bad"
[0:39:31] <%AncelDeLambert> oh no
[0:39:33] <%TheTakkster> YES!
[0:39:36] <%TheTakkster> I'm helping
[0:39:42] <+Deadbulky> O no
[0:39:46] <%Typhaeon> Thanks potato-faced Shy ripoff
[0:39:47] <Junkles> sometimes the gremlins are in chat
[0:39:48] <%AncelDeLambert> CAN you put them in the lockers? I thought they were take only
[0:39:55] <%linSP> i use those lockers too
[0:39:56] <%CrabSlacks> Ada likes moon gang
[0:40:07] <%TheTakkster> I use one locker for weapon mods andone for armor mods
[0:40:11] <%AncelDeLambert> by door
[0:40:12] <TechDragon_Z> Near entrance
[0:40:14] <Kisiel250> @AngriestPat food also has weight, there is a trait that reduces it by 50% though
[0:40:17] <%RubberFistFight> @Gieron667 I thought she was gonna put the helmet on and was like "oh get fucked" then saw what she ACTUALLY did and yelled "GET FUCKED WITH THIS HORSE-SHIT!!"
[0:40:18] <%honeyman18> Sam the NTR bot, wish it didn't hurt
[0:40:24] <TechDragon_Z> By the door.
[0:40:30] <%TheTakkster> Ye
[0:40:35] <%AncelDeLambert> oh, you CAN transfer
[0:40:39] <%Enz0ned> Have you watched blizzcon stuff yet
[0:40:46] <%GarbageNirvana> So how's moon gang?
[0:40:52] <MartinHadAMeme01> This is the only transfer prompt in this game. How weird.
[0:40:53] <Gieron667> oh shit i never thought of dumping mods into these, good idea
[0:40:56] <j64mind> ADA dislike to eggman pat
[0:41:02] <%CrabSlacks> dat tumpr pig
[0:41:02] <%AncelDeLambert> what, the cytspig?
[0:41:07] <Teyaric> CystyPigs Have Delicious Tumors For you
[0:41:08] <trueherobappo> Was there a stream or can I just look up the stuff on youtube?
[0:41:13] <%ChaosAethr> @AngriestPat Something about that Slogan Depresses me
[0:41:16] <%GarbageNirvana> They taste like bacon tho
[0:41:20] <mrhooppaw> why not just sell mods? whats the point of having 7 of the same mod?
[0:41:30] <j64mind> when you gonna catch sonic Pat?
[0:41:32] <%GarbageNirvana> You wouldn't eat a bacon tumor?
[0:41:34] <KeiPrime> what if you need the mod later tho..
[0:41:40] <%Omegaanimus> Omegaanimus subscribed at Tier 1. They've subscribed for 9 months! "This is hell! Nice to see you! Welcome!" - this corporate nightmare scape
[0:41:46] <Junkles> sell it sideways
[0:41:47] <sirrice77> @mrhooppaw but what if he needs them
[0:41:49] <ScreamLord> @ChaosAethr They also have "You've tried the best not try the rest" LUL
[0:41:52] <%MrBorisMakarov> holy shit
[0:41:53] <%AncelDeLambert> LUL the GUNS, Pat
[0:41:57] <ScreamLord> *now
[0:42:04] <+PenmanLupine> does Ammo have weight too?
[0:42:12] <%logoth_> Give em the stick
[0:42:12] <%AncelDeLambert> new area, new guns
[0:42:15] <$arcielardor> they have different standards in the future
[0:42:16] <%logoth_> DONT GIVE EM THE STICK
[0:42:18] <%TheSniperJoe> Man Blizzcon is cringe right now.
[0:42:21] <KeiPrime> ohhhhhhh
[0:42:21] <sirrice77> @PenmanLupine Nope
[0:42:23] <%GarbageNirvana> upgrades
[0:42:33] <%AncelDeLambert> Pat, just tag things as junk in the field
[0:42:35] <friggnodin> overwatch 2 coulda been a a full crackplater looter shooter and pat still woulda been disapointed that blizzcon wasnt literally on fire
[0:42:50] <Flickerember> Blizzcon heats up
[0:42:51] <j64mind> don't you guys remember moon man from before?
[0:42:51] <Gieron667> @RubberFistFight it fucking baffles me ho some rando undead that was CREATED by the litch king can just walk up to him , solo his ass and snap his hat shattering the balance of the whole universe without breaking a sweat ... i ... i mean WOMAN GOOD MAN BAD
[0:42:54] <BurningLlama777> @TheSniperJoe Are people finally shouting down pissants on the stage during their song-and-dance?
[0:43:01] <%Omegaanimus> cringe like if a guy's pants fall down and he just goes about his day pretending they're fine?
[0:43:02] <$arcielardor> I'm disappointed it's not on fire
[0:43:08] <%Bailey__gaming> @thesniperjoe what's happening I'm not watching anything due to the issues
[0:43:15] <%Omegaanimus> or cringe like a guy just has bad looking pants
[0:43:21] <%RubberFistFight> So Blizz have, with this new expansion, retconned their own retcon, and are now attempting to behave like shit that happened prior to the FIRST retcon NEVER HAPPENED, even though stuff that happens after the SECOND retcon fucking REQUIRE IT TO HAVE HAPPENED. Bunch of fucking clown shoes over there. I am pleased that the internet in general seems kinda unimpressed by it though. @Gieron667
[0:43:23] <Flickerember> What you guys dont have phones?
[0:43:23] <TechDragon_Z> Imma play Outer Worlds while I watch you play Outer Worlds.
[0:43:25] <BurningLlama777> @arcielardor Molotovs4Lyfe
[0:43:29] <trueherobappo> @AngriestPat Sam is metal AF
[0:43:34] <%TheTakkster> Literallty
[0:43:48] <tigerfang86> thanks SAM
[0:43:49] <mayorrev> wait I'm lost who's this bot named sam
[0:43:49] <$arcielardor> Jetstream SAM
[0:43:50] <trueherobappo> @TheTakkster Well played
[0:43:50] <%Omegaanimus> @RubberFistFight That sounds like something DC Comics does annually
[0:43:50] <%CrabSlacks> I think you made those corpses last time you were here
[0:43:55] <%Yakobro> @Gieron667 @RubberFistFight it's fucking dumb but she's made a "deal" with whatever was chained up in the feature trailer, the past couple of expansions she's been op shadow tendril mode sometimes.
[0:44:06] <%TheTakkster> apatDab apatDab
[0:44:12] <%Yakobro> like IT'S STILL DUMB
[0:44:13] <%GarbageNirvana> Corporate Commander, huh? Didn't know Angry Joe was in this game
[0:44:14] <trueherobappo> @mayorrev I guess he's his new companion
[0:44:37] <BurningLlama777> What about raptodon titties now
[0:44:37] <%Piemen99> TIDDE
[0:44:42] <%Agami23> did you just call that a raptor titty?
[0:44:53] <Gieron667> @RubberFistFight tbh nothing impressed me this blizzcon, maybe besides that D4 cinematic, D4 still seems like D3 with sligtly better graphics (not even that good), the systems in that game still suck ass
[0:44:54] <$arcielardor> did he say raptidon toddy?
[0:45:00] <Flickerember> Sup from the raptor tiddy
[0:45:03] <%Omegaanimus> SAM is The Cleaner like how Kenny Omega literally carried around a broom and swept
[0:45:12] <%NovaKnightmare> @AngriestPat Sam reminds me of the pods from Nier where they seem like mindless drones but have *something* underneath
[0:45:19] <%honeyman18> How much You wanna hate Mom's friendly robot corporation?
[0:45:37] <+CanonHusbando> can opener on a stick
[0:45:54] <$arcielardor> it looks like somebody glued a slap chop to a nightstick
[0:46:04] <%Omegaanimus> @honeyman18 But we're meek and neutral...like Switzerland
[0:46:13] <%Valdorick> Yeah... until you find better shill helms.
[0:46:16] <Monkeyweed21> keep armor Cumbo
[0:46:26] <%Valdorick> (there had better be better shill helms)
[0:46:34] <%NovaKnightmare> I like how obvious Moon boi's an expy of Fallou's own mascot
[0:46:38] <trueherobappo> @AngriestPat So you said you're planning on doing a second playthrough right? Have any idea on what kind of run you're gonna do?
[0:46:40] <+CanonHusbando> it's jurassic park
[0:46:42] <%RioGascar> RioGascar subscribed at Tier 1. They've subscribed for 11 months! Almost a year. q on OW. do you find it difficult to rp a character in this game when thing conflict with your own morals or ethics?
[0:46:44] <%RubberFistFight> @Yakobro Oh I don't even care at this point, all the good writers have left and they're just doubling down on their own narrative fumbles. The new cinematic is FUCKING STUPID and is trying to hide the stupidity with visual spectacle. Never mind that Bolvar-As-LK was heavily hinted as having a greater role to play. No, they just tossed that out the window in order to SuBVeRT eXpECtaTiOns
[0:46:47] <%MaddyCaddy> I'm late, has Pat made it to Monarch yet?
[0:47:06] <%honeyman18> Nope, Roseway
[0:47:07] <$arcielardor> you can make the head scientist kill himself later if you so desire. I won't say how.
[0:47:14] <%CrabSlacks> haypenny says they made the murder dogs more murdery
[0:47:15] <%dalmek> technically you CAN go to Monarch
[0:47:16] <1matheuw> are we still on tarsis?
[0:47:19] <HeadsHeldHigh> You know I played the entire game without seeing the hibernation suit helm. Did anyone else find it?
[0:47:24] <Ion_Laser> WutFace
[0:47:24] <%TheTakkster> It's distressing in here
[0:47:28] <%honeyman18> You will love and hate this place.
[0:47:29] <BurningLlama777> Janitors obviously need a raise
[0:47:32] <%SGrim> Nipton?
[0:47:34] <Flickerember> big dead
[0:47:34] <tolloponik> looks like nature kick their ass
[0:47:38] <cureneckbeard> F
[0:47:40] <%dalmek> also, weirdly my fave song on the OST
[0:47:41] <j64mind> has pat catched sonic yet?
[0:47:43] <%Valdorick> RIP Roseway
[0:47:46] <trueherobappo> what the hell happened here???
[0:47:48] <+CanonHusbando> you can actually go to monarch straight away but the overland trip is tough just like the goodsprings to the strip trip
[0:48:03] <%TheTakkster> Oh instant monarch suuuuucks
[0:48:10] <%floralkami> wait, i missed about 10 minutes
[0:48:10] <%TheTakkster> That's a rough trip
[0:48:13] <+CanonHusbando> it's auntie cleo though so they deserved it
[0:48:15] <%Yakobro> @RubberFistFight yeah I agree it's all been super dumb for a long time, I just fuck around with my friends in ff14 now between whatever other games I play
[0:48:20] <%RiceeFTW> word? i didn't think it was that rough tbh
[0:48:20] <Flickerember> Ok what is pat doing
[0:48:25] <%TheTakkster> Roseway
[0:48:32] <Flickerember> Oh stream froze for me
[0:48:39] <Flickerember> I was like why is this dead body talking
[0:48:41] <1matheuw> its a dinousaur park situation
[0:48:50] <cureneckbeard> i bet he dead
[0:48:52] <%honeyman18> It's about even combat wise, Monarch early is about where you'd need to be by the time you'd naturally get there level wise.
[0:49:01] <Ion_Laser> yeah
[0:49:02] <trueherobappo> Yup
[0:49:03] <+OutLawMiller> yes
[0:49:04] <%Valdorick> Wow, harsh thing to say to moongang.
[0:49:06] <%linSP> i thought it was moonlight sonata
[0:49:07] <%honeyman18> Nice
[0:49:07] <%TheTakkster> Roseway's theme is excellent
[0:49:08] <Flickerember> He was just talking to some guys ass and was so confused
[0:49:17] <%dabeaminator> YES
[0:49:21] <%AncelDeLambert> You can tell how desperate the corp heads are with the situation at the colony that they have their employees rattle off slogans TO EACH OTHER
[0:49:23] <%GarbageNirvana> It's pretty Mass Effect
[0:49:24] <ArtoriasTheTrenchfighter> If tou ask about the Rapt's again i think you can get more info?
[0:49:31] <Datsanegg> I just noticed that skelmo is now part of the Moon Gang
[0:49:33] <cureneckbeard> That's what space sounds like.
[0:49:35] <Gieron667> btw Auntie Cleo = anticlinic
[0:49:38] <%MaddyCaddy> I think you're about half way done with the game.
[0:49:42] <%MaddyCaddy> iirc
[0:49:45] <%honeyman18> Be careful that meat fills inventory fast as fuck.
[0:49:48] <%TheTakkster> This game is what you get if Mass effect banged New Vegas and made a baby
[0:49:52] <BurningLlama777> Fat sprats on stream with Pat
[0:49:53] <%AncelDeLambert> nah, Pat is less than a third through, it's not even close
[0:50:02] <%dabeaminator> That man just said Spacers Choice was crap in front of the Moon Gang. I respect his balls.
[0:50:07] <Flickerember> New Vegas fills me with determination
[0:50:08] <%MaddyCaddy> Maybe I finished it quite fast
[0:50:15] <%RubberFistFight> @Yakobro it stings a bit since, even though I was unlikely to resub after the shitshow that was BfA + the recent controversy, I still really had hope for the story. WotLK was when I joined and is still my favourite expac. This has kinda dashed any hopes I had of them actually honouring the canon of their own writing. Story doesn't matter to them anymore, that much is clear. It's all about the benjamins now. Like, to the exclusion of all else.
[0:50:15] <%Captainahab_37> this game looks a lot better than I thought
[0:50:22] <%Pappajimbo> lootty
[0:50:23] <Gieron667> i remember reviewers saying this game is short, how the fuck is it short ?
[0:50:28] <Gruhunchously> I saw the Steve Buscemi with the hat hanging over it and thought it was Paige, silently watching.
[0:50:30] <%TheTakkster> Admittedly Pat spent about 4 hours between landing on the groundbreaker and reaching the stores
[0:50:34] <j64mind> tell me pat, what you think about the PACING?
[0:50:35] <%AncelDeLambert> IKR, it seems incredibly big
[0:50:37] <%MaddyCaddy> It sure was a blur because I enjoyed a lot of it and got lost in the time.
[0:50:45] <BurningLlama777> ew
[0:50:46] <%CrabSlacks> fool missions are my favorite!
[0:50:49] <%Ner234> Not me
[0:50:53] <%RiceeFTW> @Gieron667 i feel like for people that aren't into the completionist style of playing then I can see it being "short"
[0:50:53] <%ape_hawk> cut me off some of that CYST
[0:50:56] <%linSP> mmm cysts
[0:51:06] <%ape_hawk> with extra PUSS
[0:51:12] <%AncelDeLambert> I'm actually slowing down a lot in this game, having trouble keeping my attention on it
[0:51:16] <%Yakobro> LUL
[0:51:18] <%TheTakkster> Imagine having a pig that you pick meat off of like picking grapes from a vine
[0:51:20] <%TheTakkster> yum yum
[0:51:21] <%Ner234> LUL
[0:51:24] <%AncelDeLambert> the growth rate of power in game is kinda stilted
[0:51:25] <Ion_Laser> LUL
[0:51:25] <BurningLlama777> EWWW
[0:51:25] <Gruhunchously> Oh, okay.
[0:51:26] <%ape_hawk> TAKE IT
[0:51:33] <%ape_hawk> TAKE TAKE TAKE TAKE TAKE TAKE
[0:51:34] <%RiceeFTW> i think this one's bugged
[0:51:37] <trueherobappo> @AngriestPat Take this one.
[0:51:38] <%AncelDeLambert> FUCK that
[0:51:39] <%RiceeFTW> or is that another one
[0:51:39] <%KautzkyGuy> KautzkyGuy subscribed at Tier 1. They've subscribed for 5 months! It's not the best choice, it's Spacers Choice!
[0:51:40] <Gruhunchously> Aww
[0:51:44] <%linSP> WTF THIS PERK IS NOT THAT BAD
[0:51:45] <%Valdorick> all these flaws seem awful...
[0:51:46] <%GarbageNirvana> hahaha
[0:51:46] <Gieron667> @RiceeFTW like every early reviewer (IGN and all those) said the game is 20 hours or something and called it short ? lol how the fuck.
[0:51:47] <ArtoriasTheTrenchfighter> No
[0:51:48] <+Maleicus> i mean why not
[0:51:50] <j64mind> HAHA, PARANOID
[0:51:52] <majindusto> I DID NOTHING WRONG
[0:51:52] <+theactualjimbo> Is there a flaw for excess goblins?
[0:51:53] <%TheNommad> TheNommad subscribed with Twitch Prime. They've subscribed for 8 months! Yeet, happy NNN everyone /s
[0:51:59] <%AncelDeLambert> yeah it is, personality points are half the skills
[0:52:00] <%ape_hawk> but pat, you ARE paranoid!
[0:52:02] <%TDAWS_MP132> -1 to two Ability scores would be awful
[0:52:04] <%TheTakkster> You can 100% this game in 40 hours easy
[0:52:06] <%Ner234> Can you imagine if you COULDN'T reject flaws? How much harder would the game be?
[0:52:08] <j64mind> EXACTLY
[0:52:08] <%AncelDeLambert> LOOK AT ALL THOSE AFFECTED SKILLS!
[0:52:09] <%honeyman18> I took robophobia and SAM kills my stats when he's in my team now.
[0:52:10] <%RiceeFTW> @Valdorick they only proc in certain circumstances generally
[0:52:10] <%TDAWS_MP132> he was right not to take it
[0:52:11] <MrDante7> but only when you would be in restricted areas, or sneaking @AngriestPat
[0:52:12] <%MaddyCaddy> Most Flaws are complete dog shit
[0:52:16] <trueherobappo> @AngriestPat That makes sense..
[0:52:16] <%TheTakkster> It's mass effect sized, not fallout sized
[0:52:17] <Gruhunchously> Pat denies his own nature.
[0:52:18] <%v1Ables> i took that and it decreases all those skills by -4 and -7 when sneaking
[0:52:19] <%thegreatestbambe> Flaws are really flawed in this game
[0:52:19] <%linSP> supernova should force you to take flaws
[0:52:22] <j64mind> PARANOID EGGMAN
[0:52:30] <%MaddyCaddy> The only good flaws are the ones that reduce you resistances because it's already too easy
[0:52:32] <%AncelDeLambert> the perks also aren't great
[0:52:34] <LodiFrostbeard> and perks aren't that good
[0:52:35] <%thegreatestbambe> The robot flaw makes it so you can't even use Sam
[0:52:40] <majindusto> IM NOT PARANOID...YOU'RE PARANOID
[0:52:40] <%thegreatestbambe> Really fucked up
[0:52:44] <majindusto> lol
[0:52:57] <%honeyman18> Afraid of robots and Acid, so terrible
[0:52:57] <+Maleicus> i should try to get that paranoid
[0:53:03] <%CrabSlacks> this guy is wearing a super mutant monocle
[0:53:04] <@Moobot> Hey, if you guys feel like checking out The Outer Worlds on account of this stream or cause you think I'm cool, go ahead and use this link https://bit.ly/2JmpB3Q to grab it off Greenman Gaming, and I'll get a few bucks kicked back. Thanks!
[0:53:04] <Gieron667> this game feels like Mass Effect 2 to me, maybe slightly shorter
[0:53:07] <Ando_is_dabes> this guy sounds like the doctor from NV
[0:53:07] <%RiceeFTW> @LodiFrostbeard the "end game" skills are lacking IMO
[0:53:10] <LostCire> only flaw I took was a fear for Primals
[0:53:12] <+Hick12> Don't take the auto-mechanical flaw. It really sucks and even activates around SAM.
[0:53:14] <+CanonHusbando> only good flaws you should take are the animal phobia flaws because theyre only active until you kill the enemy and never effect conversations or general gameplay
[0:53:20] <BurningLlama777> I like this guy's voice acting
[0:53:26] <%thegreatestbambe> yea it even has a shitter tali clone in this game too
[0:53:29] <%NovaKnightmare> blowjobs?

[0:53:36] <Rosy_Joan> a head?
[0:53:38] <Gruhunchously> Ew
[0:53:40] <LodiFrostbeard> @RiceeFTW tbh i feel like they cut it short, the game ends way to abruptly imo
[0:53:40] <BurningLlama777> tiddy benefits
[0:53:43] <%NovaKnightmare> Blowjobs????
[0:53:49] <Gruhunchously> This is getting weird
[0:53:52] <%thegreatestbambe> The big "Suck"

[0:54:10] <%BillyMaze> Post apocalypse boner pills?
[0:54:11] <oceanbed98> Did pat see any of the blizzcon stuff?
[0:54:11] <%AncelDeLambert> holy shit I did this before I landed Ellie
[0:54:12] <%Piemen99> the lizard tiddies wanna fuck
[0:54:15] <%CrabSlacks> suck dem rapt butts for big boner power
[0:54:15] <%Valdorick> X to doubt
[0:54:16] <%RiceeFTW> @LodiFrostbeard that too, I definitely felt like there was more to play, prob DLC?
[0:54:17] <mayorrev> eewe
[0:54:22] <mayorrev> ewwww
[0:54:22] <TrollKing96> WTF is musk?!
[0:54:30] <Gieron667> Elon Musk
[0:54:30] <%voltage996> DansGame
[0:54:30] <Zaphire_Saucypants> mmmmmm musk
[0:54:36] <%Valdorick> Ball sweat and piss
[0:54:39] <+CanonHusbando> I like how ellie knows exactly what aphrodisiacs require to make
[0:54:40] <grayjammer> Delicious delicious pheromones
[0:54:41] <%honeyman18> Spunk juice They piss to mark territory
[0:54:42] <Gruhunchously> You'll find out when you're older
[0:54:43] <%PipIV> scent glands
[0:54:47] <%linSP> i tried musk flavored gum from australia, didnt taste that good
[0:54:50] <+CanonHusbando> it's raptor smeg
[0:54:54] <prime_name> I wanna smell like reptile dick
[0:54:58] <cureneckbeard> Right down the road!
[0:55:14] <%PipIV> uh huh
[0:55:17] <%logoth_> Is auntie cleo just mom from Futurama
[0:55:24] <BurningLlama777> It'll make you a... sexual tyrannosaurus?
[0:55:28] <Gruhunchously> Hope that guard didn't hear any of that
[0:55:30] <LodiFrostbeard> @RiceeFTW the unused nodes on the map pretty much guarantees DLC i think, and now that everyone loved this they'll probably make a sequel
[0:55:34] <+CanonHusbando> auntie cleo is 100% futurama mom
[0:55:38] <fruit_pie_the_magician> Now I gotta lay down back. Cuz my concussion have me sleepy
[0:55:38] <Rosy_Joan> Soooo we could just steal it and sell it to the buyer instead of cutting a share right?
[0:55:47] <%jettybandit> jettybandit subscribed at Tier 1. They've subscribed for 2 months! 
[0:55:48] <toasty_salads> pat your crazy talk has led me down a road that feels like clothes when your drenched in mud and it dries... that nice crunch
[0:55:48] <%PipIV> buncha slack jawed.. maggots
[0:55:54] <%starotter70> Hey guys, how's it going?
[0:55:59] <%MelBrooksKA> Bathrooms don't have doors. Silly Pat
[0:56:02] <Gruhunchously> Welcome back to another episode of Steal from the Poor
[0:56:05] <%BillyMaze> Time to hit the phramacy for some rapter brand viagra
[0:56:09] <%TheTakkster> That's good armor
[0:56:13] <Gieron667> Gotta say SAM is a little disappointing, he's no Legion
[0:56:21] <BurningLlama777> OooOOoo
[0:56:22] <+Baekon01> lose tech skills tho
[0:56:25] <cureneckbeard> I love how nobody in this game notices that you walked into a room, walked out, and now all their stuff is missing
[0:56:26] <%JGardner88> Thicc Thighs
[0:56:36] <%RiceeFTW> @LodiFrostbeard I hope there's a sequel, I think there's a lot more they can do with this. At the very least another game of a similar style, they very obviously had this formula right
[0:56:38] <+CanonHusbando> it's unique armor but the icon is too big so you can barely see the flair
[0:56:41] <%CrabSlacks> "it has my musk"
[0:56:51] <LodiFrostbeard> @Gieron667 comparing thing to legion is unfair
[0:57:09] <Flickerember> Everyone is scared of moongang
[0:57:19] <BurningLlama777> Aww c'mon Pat those people are probably gonna be hanged by the company or something
[0:57:26] <crazypieman7> @AngriestPat For someone who wants to get into Star Trek, where would you recommend starting?
[0:57:28] <%starotter70> You bough this? ...I bought this
[0:57:38] <+CanonHusbando> SPORTS
[0:57:39] <SaltMaestro> Given how everyone is jizzing their pants over how amazing this game is, it would be financially foolish to NOT make a sequel eventually
[0:57:41] <Gieron667> @LodiFrostbeard well the whole companion system is kind like mass effect, and he's the weird robot member of your team, i think that's fair
[0:57:42] <Teyaric> These guys have like a half hour of dialog
[0:57:44] <Teyaric> I don't know why
[0:58:06] <BurningLlama777> @SaltMaestro And it's not like there's going to be a Fallout game to compete with it ever again. 8)
[0:58:14] <Gieron667> @LodiFrostbeard i just miss Legion ok ? :(
[0:58:19] <+CanonHusbando> reading the tossball cards and trying to figure out the rules is a trip
[0:58:21] <SolverCODO> A Grim Vendango machine
[0:58:23] <%BillyMaze> ew bring math into my sportball
[0:58:27] <LodiFrostbeard> @Gieron667 i know man, i know
[0:58:27] <Gruhunchously> Yeah, I don't have high hopes for the Fallout franchise at this point.
[0:58:35] <+CanonHusbando> there are like 100 players on the field and people die
[0:58:40] <BurningLlama777> Fallout = Salted Earth
[0:58:42] <%RubberFistFight> @crazypieman7 Pat'll probably miss it, but I've been into trek since I was a kid so I can answer that. Start with TNG, just be aware that the first 2 seasons are a little... odd... compared to where the show wound up. Supplement that with TOS and the kirk-era movies to your own taste.
[0:58:43] <Kisiel250> The call me Pat I'm the leader of the gang, cause I love moonface
[0:58:44] <%dabeaminator> Fantasy Tossball is a serious game for people with big dicks.
[0:58:44] <Zaphire_Saucypants> Pat has been infected with the earworm.
[0:58:45] <ManlyMcBeefington> oh the wanted poster has the dude who wakes you on it
[0:58:55] <Flickerember> And you'll love it to
[0:59:23] <+CanonHusbando> stealthy pink
[0:59:32] <mayorrev> @angriestpat next time Paige tells you you're doing something stupid, just tell her it's Spacer's Choice
[0:59:35] <crazypieman7> @RubberFistFight Thanks for the response!
[0:59:37] <+Baekon01> saw a item on the sink
[0:59:42] <LostCire> its a shame you cant Moon Gang Sam
[0:59:43] <Gieron667> the more i play Outer Worlds the more i wana replay Mass Effect
[0:59:46] <j64mind> it's not the best choice it's eggman choice
[0:59:48] <ron2clawedphd> Moon Gang. Moon Gang. Moon Gang.
[0:59:57] <+CanonHusbando> your companion armor skills matter way less than giving them armor that boosts their 3 tagged skills
[1:00:30] <%RubberFistFight> @Gieron667 I just had a thought. Bolvar is supposed to become our ally for this expac. Maybe he'll fix the Helm of Domination with the power of FLEX TAPE. <slaps helmet> This baby can hold so many souls of the damned!
[1:00:32] <Gieron667> @CanonHusbando really ? how so ?
[1:00:35] <+RAAAAAINMAKER> Goon Mang
[1:00:37] <BurningLlama777> "if u cant handle me at my wurst u dont deserv me at my best"
[1:01:19] <Gieron667> @RubberFistFight now that's blizzard lvl writing right there !
[1:01:21] <%BillyMaze> Lying, the most crucial skill for life
[1:01:46] <+JM_FUNK> @AngriestPat Hey Pat, hows the combat compared to fallout and other FPS?
[1:02:13] <+RAAAAAINMAKER> The real question is if he'll pay for the NavKey or tank the monsters
[1:02:18] <Gieron667> man this game is so pretty T-T
[1:02:20] <+CanonHusbando> their tagged skills improve your skills by a fourth of their skill level, armor doesn't really improve their survivability
[1:02:26] <+JM_FUNK> Thanks Pat
[1:02:29] <trueherobappo> SAM is too woke for me man.. holy moly..
[1:02:40] <Dementedpenguin> Go away.... but buy something first. Kappa
[1:02:46] <Gieron667> @CanonHusbando oh shit really ? didnt know
[1:02:46] <%honeyman18> Bar at the end of the Universe
[1:03:11] <%BillyMaze> she says that like she's offering road head
[1:03:17] <BurningLlama777> o/` You load 16 tons and whaddoya get o/`
[1:03:22] <+CanonHusbando> @Gieron667 yeah their survivability is based on your inspiration and leadership
[1:03:41] <Teyaric> Casually being starved for being off books, yup, all corporations Got To Go
[1:03:45] <%GarbageNirvana> pass-tuh
[1:03:54] <Gieron667> She looks way to simmilar to the bar lady from that other town you were in, nearwater or what was it called
[1:04:09] <+CanonHusbando> theyre gonna reopen again in 7 years as 16th bar
[1:04:20] <pmtriox> so did you find the GECK yet?
[1:04:21] <%SvenHolgersson> EXSQUEEZE ME
[1:04:21] <+CanonHusbando> it's a countdown
[1:04:22] <+TOONFOOD> @gieron667 amelia?
[1:04:22] <%Xelig> why is there always that weird lighting that makes people's ears glow red when you're talking to them
[1:04:26] <%GarbageNirvana> Edgewater? Nah, that one was more obviously starving than this one
[1:04:33] <Gieron667> @CanonHusbando damn well gotta swap my gear for them then
[1:04:42] <Monkeyweed21> 1 more building
[1:04:44] <%crimsonharvest> how does nobody recognize that they're holding themselves hostage
[1:04:57] <BurningLlama777> That is cool. The rings that is.
[1:05:08] <Gieron667> @GarbageNirvana compare their eyes, they are like the exact same
[1:05:09] <BurningLlama777> Yikes.
[1:05:14] <%SvenHolgersson> jESUS DUDE
[1:05:16] <%nicos143> Oh this dude.....
[1:05:25] <+CanonHusbando> @Gieron667 i mean you dont need to worry about it really even on hard but if youre gonna minmax you might as well minmax your minmaxing
[1:05:27] <grayjammer> Oh, that sounds like the plethora of failed restaurants in my area. There's just some real estate properties on our Main Streets that just close down in less than a year, get re-bought by someone else, and then close down again, ad-infinitum.
[1:05:28] <%GarbageNirvana> @crimsonharvest Folks are dissuaded from "stimulating the imagination"
[1:05:36] <ChoculaUltra> is it weird that Fallout games made me like old timey music but only if it sounds like its from another room away?
[1:05:45] <sirrice77> @crimsonharvest too busy to think about it, too scared to think about it or figured it out but cant do anything about it
[1:06:02] <%AdmiralButtloaf> is this the talking pig from disenchanted?
[1:06:02] <Gieron667> @CanonHusbando yea im crushing everything on hard so far, game is kinda easy
[1:06:15] <+CanonHusbando> @Gieron667 it's really easy
[1:06:18] <%CrabSlacks> smoking rapt butts for big boner power

[1:08:58] <SquigglyLizard> lol
[1:09:02] <BurningLlama777> I haven't seen any of this game before. I'm starting to see what people were talking about about the writing. ^_^
[1:09:04] <%Yakobro> @fruit_pie_the_magician there's a REALLY GOOD REASON in general for the whole colony but that's later :p

[1:11:24] <thebiganxiety> !Uptime
[1:11:24] <@Moobot> I've been playing this game for how long? Oh only 1h 11m.
[1:11:50] <%depressed_skeleton> trash
[1:11:52] <Gieron667> thing about SAM is that ... no companions talk to him (i think) cuz usually thay have conversations between eachother but SAM is just "lul i clean stuff"
[1:11:52] <%dekkitout> Spinal!
[1:11:54] <%linSP> throw that small number shit out of here
[1:11:58] <LostCire> Heavy Machine Gun, man that is some Metal Slug right there
[1:12:11] <+D00msDayDan> i wish both machine guns were more accurate
[1:12:16] <+G_Thunders> @gieron667 Parvati had a ton of conversations with him in my game. No idea if other characters do though
[1:12:20] <%Ner234> LUL
[1:12:27] <+Hick12> Uses different ammo so it can be better than Old reliable depending on the target.
[1:12:30] <BurningLlama777> These peoples' workplace demeanor is way too relatable
[1:12:31] <%BillyMaze> Ok so let me get this staight. Pat has been tasked with harvesting the organs of mutant dinosaurs so he can make some viagra and a tube of Colgate?
[1:12:34] <%strugglepunk2> man I can't wait till you find the anthromorphized embodiment of soulless, laborer crushing capitalism and shit in it's cereal. Then everyone claps. Yay.
[1:12:40] <%CrabSlacks> "We're the moon gang"

[1:13:02] <+CanonHusbando> it's like 30 seconds
[1:13:05] <canolucass> the only thing i don't like is that you always end up having far more bullets than u need, and also bullets weight is zero.. so almost dont affect gameplay at all
[1:13:07] <%dekkitout> Moon Crew! Gang gang
[1:13:10] <breakerdsx> We're sailing on the Moon, we carry a harpoon.
[1:13:17] <%linSP> wow smart

[1:13:49] <NeroInfinite> we're whalers one the moon
[1:14:05] <theamazingroberto> the speech mannerisms the npcs in this game have are weird, "were it returned to me" and "have need of my keycard"
[1:14:06] <%dekkitout> Something something plasma pistol?
[1:14:10] <breakerdsx> We save scummers tonight! j/k

[1:15:28] <%GarbageQueenEllie> I wish that worked irl
[1:15:29] <This_is_Marco> shoot him again
[1:15:29] <%roundaboutrevengeance> He gives you the gun later
[1:15:30] <%bread_assassin> Uh, he gives you gun, too.
[1:15:30] <ManlyMcBeefington> @AngriestPat do you want to know about the reward for that quest?
[1:15:31] <%Enz0ned> fuck em
[1:15:31] <TheHeroAppears> kill him more
[1:15:32] <+CanonHusbando> you get a unique gun
[1:15:33] <Flickerember> Big smart Pat
[1:15:34] <%linSP> he finishes the gun and gives it to you
[1:15:35] <%XeroSigmaPrime> DUDE
[1:15:37] <lethallylactic> You get the gun LUL
[1:15:42] <%XeroSigmaPrime> HE GIVES A SICK ASS GUN
[1:15:45] <%dekkitout> Bites The Dust has no weakness!
[1:15:45] <ChoculaUltra> he gives you the prototype you foolish canuck!
[1:15:46] <senfood> oh god oh fuck he's sAVING
[1:15:47] <%BillyMaze> Y'know, for survivors of a post apocalyptic wasteland, people sure are fucking stupid
[1:15:47] <%Archer2150> But GUN pat
[1:15:49] <+FatherGreyBeard> You get a gun
[1:15:49] <%TheTakkster> It's a shitty unique gun
[1:15:50] <Gieron667> is the gun good ?
[1:15:53] <%PipIV> I liked that guy..
[1:15:53] <%v1Ables> fair enough
[1:15:55] <%bread_assassin> TWO sick ass guns.
[1:15:56] <1matheuw> go back for GUN
[1:15:57] <%strugglepunk2> What's worth more pat, money and stuff, or shiny special guns?
[1:15:58] <LostCire> true
[1:16:05] <Gieron667> all uniques seem shitty in this game so far
[1:16:06] <Flickerember> get 10 SICK GUNS
[1:16:07] <+TOONFOOD> you actually get 2 unique guns
[1:16:09] <%dekkitout> Back to the past?
[1:16:09] <fearhurst> more like a suck-ass gun
[1:16:10] <Flickerember> Dont believe me
[1:16:15] <LodiFrostbeard> giving him the schematic is MUCH better
[1:16:24] <%XeroSigmaPrime> I love get PAt's mind goblins to make him immediately regret his decision
[1:16:25] <%GarbageNirvana> I mean you do need those bits too tho
[1:16:26] <+RAAAAAINMAKER> he gives you a fire gun now and a corrison gun later
[1:16:27] <fruit_pie_the_magician> Yes, go back later, after you turn these quest items in
[1:16:29] <Flickerember> the hell was that
[1:16:30] <fIashman92> Him and the other scientist, if you give their stuff to Gladys it counts as a failure. You can only screw over the main scientist and have it not count as a blunder.
[1:16:32] <%strugglepunk2> Man, I love SAM
[1:16:32] <%GarbageQueenEllie> I see you acquired The Robot
[1:16:35] <%SvenHolgersson> Sam rules
[1:16:38] <%SGrim> @AngriestPat if you don't sell to him you'll never be able to get ever gun in the game. How will you handle that knowledge? apatGoblin
[1:16:39] <BurningLlama777> Ooh that was cool.
[1:16:41] <%TheTakkster> Sam does his best
[1:16:44] <%SGrim> every*
[1:16:44] <%GarbageNirvana> afaik there's no way to get the navkey except to buy it
[1:16:45] <breakerdsx> Who need courage, WHEN YOU HAVE A GUN?
[1:16:47] <%SGrim> Fucking Y
[1:16:48] <Flickerember> So party has supers
[1:16:50] <Flickerember> ?
[1:16:51] <BurningLlama777> Supers kickin' off during combat
[1:16:54] <%ape_hawk> pat is giving a new meaning to the phrase "mooning"
[1:16:54] <BurningLlama777> Right?
[1:16:57] <This_is_Marco> sam has the best comedic timing
[1:17:12] <%GarbageQueenEllie> I'm ok, thanks
[1:17:18] <Flickerember> I dont know whats worse robot with lasers or robot with acid
[1:17:26] <%dekkitout> Still dead inside, thanks for asking
[1:17:31] <%joylent_blue> been better
[1:17:33] <+CanonHusbando> you don't actually need to buy the navkey you can just fly to the bad part of monarch and walk there
[1:17:44] <%strugglepunk2> shit
[1:17:46] <%GarbageNirvana> Oh yeah, forgot
[1:17:59] <BurningLlama777> @Flickerember I feel like lasers would hurt less maybe...?
[1:18:03] <%strugglepunk2> you're 100% right @CanonHusbando . Why didn't I do that.
[1:18:13] <%Archer2150> Pat go get your ticket
[1:18:18] <%strugglepunk2> Wait actually i think there's a reason that doesn't work
[1:18:20] <%joylent_blue> but Cascadia is scarwy
[1:18:24] <%Archer2150> Pat your ticket
[1:18:31] <Flickerember> @BurningLlama777 As llong as the aim is good aye its quicker
[1:18:37] <ChoculaUltra> game gives me major Futurama vibes.
[1:18:40] <+SickBangerzM9> for a second this looked like no mans sky
[1:18:55] <BurningLlama777> bewm
[1:19:03] <+CanonHusbando> @strugglepunk2 it's 100% just the run from goodsprings to the strip but you miss the exp from turning in the gladys quests
[1:19:04] <%dekkitout> That bork got busted to shit
[1:19:08] <%GarbageQueenEllie> A merciful kill. Befitting of a hunter
[1:19:18] <Monkeyweed21> that was ORthrus
[1:19:22] <%strugglepunk2> I thought there was that BIG LOCK for BIG THIEVES
[1:19:39] <%cafefunk> Hey Pat, everyone bunnycIAO
[1:19:44] <%BillyMaze> Bits are the currency? so are we playing the version of the future where Amazon takes over the world and leads us to nuclear war?
[1:19:46] <%TheTakkster> Roseway is nice. Less barren than Emerald Vale
[1:20:17] <%TheTakkster> Oh i didn't find this
[1:20:24] <%GarbageQueenEllie> @BillyMaze Nah man, it's TwitchPrime world. We can't show ass or else we'll get BANNED
[1:20:27] <%Faustgesicht> Oh hey you got SAM. Was it this stream?
[1:20:29] <+TOONFOOD> cascadia is lovely and full of bunnies
[1:20:35] <+CanonHusbando> actually theyre bitcoin
[1:20:37] <%strugglepunk2> i dunno why, but i never really liked any of the energy weapons in the game.
[1:20:42] <canolucass> 1052 bullets already lol
[1:20:43] <%DracaenaLeaf> Woolie rug
[1:20:48] <%dekkitout> Moonshine for the Moon Crew
[1:21:03] <%BillyMaze> actually its moon gang
[1:21:05] <%croxeye> so pat is playing a stealth archer?
[1:21:06] <%joylent_blue> you get so much ammo in this game
[1:21:09] <%ape_hawk> so has the blizzard fanbase forgiven them yet?
[1:21:11] <%joylent_blue> its crazy
[1:21:14] <+CanonHusbando> that is the distillery
[1:21:20] <%strugglepunk2> Either I'm using the sniper carbine thing, or I'm going full auto
[1:21:21] <+CanonHusbando> it's a moonshiner hut
[1:21:37] <LodiFrostbeard> @joylent_blue i finished the game with 5k+ on all types of ammo, it's silly
[1:21:54] <%joylent_blue> i‚Äôve seen a depressing amount of overwatch 2 positivity on twitter
[1:22:11] <%strugglepunk2> Eh. I figure it's more rough on people who are using heavy weapons
[1:22:20] <theamazingroberto> people excited for a game is "depressing" to you? @joylent_blue
[1:22:23] <%GarbageQueenEllie> Let's start a crowdfund for matching MoonGang leather jackets
[1:22:27] <Gieron667> @LodiFrostbeard i had that much halfway through and sold half of it
[1:22:32] <1matheuw> put points into GUN pat
[1:22:37] <Flickerember> @AngriestPat So cause I missed streams, does this game have Skyrim problem of armor having xp so if stealth you are big squish?
[1:22:43] <%goose_attack_almanac> I hope there is a dialogue option to tell some dickhead that your life doesn't revolve around him
[1:22:44] <%strugglepunk2> because I stopped having ammo issues the second I stopped using automatic weapons for a while.
[1:22:46] <+secretspud> Moon man here to your your day!
[1:22:48] <%Ner234> apatBig Nerd
[1:22:55] <%cafefunk> Im i a piece of shit if i buy overwatch 2?
[1:22:57] <+secretspud> with bullets
[1:23:02] <Flickerember> Oh thank god
[1:23:03] <%cafefunk> *am i
[1:23:07] <%strugglepunk2> Is it even a sequel?
[1:23:07] <@Moobot> Hey, if you guys feel like checking out The Outer Worlds on account of this stream or cause you think I'm cool, go ahead and use this link https://bit.ly/2JmpB3Q to grab it off Greenman Gaming, and I'll get a few bucks kicked back. Thanks!
[1:23:12] <+SickBangerzM9> is there third person and how is the weapon variety?
[1:23:13] <%joylent_blue> @theamazingroberto that people don‚Äôt seem to care enough about real world issues to outweigh excitement for the shiny new toy, yeah its depressing
[1:23:20] <%BillyMaze> apatBig science spatBig number
[1:23:21] <%goose_attack_almanac> @cafefunk Just means you're interested in the game. Or the Character models
[1:23:30] <Gieron667> more like Overwatch 1 with PvE content
[1:23:33] <%strugglepunk2> like from what I've heard it sounds more like a big update/expac, then a full games worth of content
[1:23:42] <LodiFrostbeard> @strugglepunk2 it's a full price patch, fucking criminal
[1:23:47] <%GarbageQueenEllie> People can buy Overwatch 2 and still think Blizzard are lousy China dogs
[1:23:59] <+CanonHusbando> science bruiser is too powerful in this, by the time you get max his 3rd perk and all the perks you're doing like 250% damage with the prismatic hammer
[1:24:02] <%strugglepunk2> yeah that's a direct to pornhub sequel to me dog.
[1:24:08] <+CanonHusbando> you can totally hit 10K regularly
[1:24:12] <Gieron667> @AngriestPat can you change to Hard now ?
[1:24:16] <%joylent_blue> of course, if you look at it as supporting the devs, who didn‚Äôt make the shitty decisions, then whatever, i can‚Äôt being myself to make that logic jump
[1:24:16] <%depressed_skeleton> i am glad it has a big sign
[1:24:20] <%Deft_Thought> Is melee fun enough to go for a full melee build in Outer Worlds?
[1:24:22] <%joylent_blue> bring
[1:24:45] <%Deft_Thought> I liked punching things in the face in New Vegas but it wasn't exactly deep
[1:24:45] <+CanonHusbando> @Deft_Thought melee is OP in this
[1:24:50] <%Deft_Thought> Oh really?
[1:24:51] <%strugglepunk2> @Deft_Thought As long as you turbo towards getting prismatic hammer as soon as possible
[1:25:00] <%LiquidShake83> kill
[1:25:12] <+CanonHusbando> yeah, max science with the prismatic hammer is one hit KO on anything forever
[1:25:14] <%NovaKnightmare> why is this cleaning robot beefier than a tank?
[1:25:14] <theamazingroberto> @joylent_blue do you use google products? samsung? apple? microsoft? sony? i'd get timed out long before i could fit a full list of the companies that bend over for china.
[1:25:19] <%Ner234> Need a better shock gun. These things are getting tough
[1:25:27] <%ape_hawk> i dunno, new vegas had a LOT of fun unarmed weapons
[1:25:34] <%BillyMaze> @AngriestPat i Does this game have the same problem of bethesda games where melee weapons are mind numbingly dull to use?
[1:25:34] <%ape_hawk> like the 2-step goodbye
[1:25:46] <fIashman92> None of the science weapons are damage weapons
[1:25:47] <%ape_hawk> or the golden boxing gloves
[1:25:53] <%Rlexp> it does damage, but not a great amount if I remember correctly
[1:25:54] <%strugglepunk2> @theamazingroberto true, but we can at least try to punish egregious shit when we see it.
[1:25:55] <Monkeyweed21> science applies to plasma and shock
[1:26:08] <Gieron667> Pat change to Hard shit's to easyyyyyyy
[1:26:14] <LostCire> shrink ray just seems like a novelty for its effect
[1:26:17] <%joylent_blue> @theamazingroberto i understand that, its ultimately a losing battle as it is, but giving no pushback at all doesn‚Äôt seem right either
[1:26:22] <%depressed_skeleton> Mmm that Delicious goo
[1:26:24] <+RAAAAAINMAKER> Best science weapon is the Hammer
[1:26:32] <%strugglepunk2> Financial ties to china are hard to dodge in this day and age, which is a sort of failing of capitalism
[1:26:36] <+secretspud> Moon Man Fucks
[1:26:37] <Gnomageddon> Pat plays for the story
[1:26:45] <$PaleBloodInk> Yeah, the Hammer can be massively overpowered if you pump Science.
[1:26:47] <%GarbageQueenEllie> I mean, in terms of practicality, it's best to shit on the source of the fuckery- the country that's run totalitarian and manipulates companies into cowtowing
[1:26:48] <%dekkitout> Moon Crew!
[1:26:48] <+SickBangerzM9> pat plays for the big numbers
[1:26:49] <vaderxyz1970> I beat the game with only the science weapons
[1:26:51] <%joylent_blue> hard is too easy too tbh
[1:26:51] <%somerandombloo> somerandombloo subscribed at Tier 1. They've subscribed for 10 months, currently on a 8 month streak! 
[1:26:53] <%depressed_skeleton> Moon gang!
[1:27:06] <deviljhojho_> I love this game
[1:27:11] <+CanonHusbando> honestly there arent enough science weapons in this to justify going that route unless you do hammer
[1:27:15] <deviljhojho_> its not new vegas tier but its very solid
[1:27:16] <%cvp5127> @AngriestPat will death stranding be a full lp
[1:27:16] <%dekkitout> Robots are just bad at making fwiends
[1:27:33] <Gieron667> @joylent_blue yea but this is just combat start, mucic plays 3 notes, combat ends
[1:27:43] <%GarbageQueenEllie> Basically, if you dislike China, dislike China. You don't have to stop buying shit to do that
[1:28:10] <%CrabSlacks> robots are able to see the illogical nature of capitalism and it makes them want to crush the system
[1:28:11] <Gnomageddon> 1234
[1:28:25] <%strugglepunk2> essentially, because it's a huge market, capitalism is working against it's "Pro-democracy" reputation. In order to appease a large emerging market, the companies are acting as agents of a totalitarian government censorship's efforts without China needing to do... anything, really.
[1:28:44] <%RubberFistFight> @GarbageQueenEllie y'know i'm having basically that exact conversation with my community in my discord right now, and we're actually conducting ourselves like reasonable adults, which is refreshing.
[1:28:59] <%ape_hawk> capitalism is just communism with extra steps
[1:29:06] <%ape_hawk> yeah, i said it!
[1:29:13] <%strugglepunk2> Governments are the same
[1:29:17] <+wjones0415> so, I watched blizzcon. the plight Hong Kong has not stopped people from jizzing about overwatch!
[1:29:17] <%Ner234> Tanky
[1:29:26] <LostCire> yeah light ammo no good against armor
[1:29:27] <%GarbageQueenEllie> @RubberFistFight That's always nice to hear.
[1:29:33] <%XeroSigmaPrime> @GarbageQueenEllie Amen! Fuck China, but I still want my steady supply of dragon dildos!... so ergh... fuck china?
[1:29:58] <theamazingroberto> SAM needs robot food
[1:30:02] <suikudo> Bad Dragon dildo's are made in the USA
[1:30:06] <canolucass> thats a clever stream layout with the two bars and webcam in the corner first time i see that
[1:30:07] <%joylent_blue> yeah damage types are super important as you go on
[1:30:11] <%GarbageNirvana> Wasn't China's market share in the grand scheme of things in the minority anyway
[1:30:16] <%GarbageQueenEllie> @XeroSigmaPrime Ah, the age old conundrum. Do we fuck China or *fuck* China?
[1:30:18] <Flickerember> Clean american dildos
[1:30:20] <%dekkitout> Bad Dragon is 100% built on freedom?
[1:30:24] <+wjones0415> @suikudo yeah, but the materials are from china.
[1:30:25] <%ape_hawk> so did they show actual gameplay of ow2 or was it just an announcment?
[1:30:25] <+CanonHusbando> dragon dildos from china? bad dragon is in arizona
[1:30:28] <%XeroSigmaPrime> The US makes shitty dragon dildos
[1:30:35] <BurningLlama777> Uncle Sam Salutes with Smaug's Delight in hand
[1:30:35] <%DracaenaLeaf> Robo Ass
[1:30:39] <%strugglepunk2> In an RPG, ellie's arguement makes sense. I'll ignore chests with no locks, because I don't need the shit in it, but i'll pick a lock just for the xp.
[1:30:39] <TheHeroAppears> I find it alarming that your big brain character telepathically pulls himself up the ladder
[1:30:39] <%RubberFistFight> @GarbageQueenEllie Not to mention that "boycotting" them won't achieve anything unless more than half of their ENTIRE playerbase across ALL products does it, since they likely have eggs in many baskets as far as their revenue streams go. It's an uncomfortable truth that I feel a lot of people don't grasp. Does that mean people shouldn't try? No. But they shouldn't get distressed at the gap between "how they want it to be" versus "how it is".
[1:30:41] <%BillyMaze> ok so we went from blizzcon to dragon dildo's why?
[1:30:49] <+RAAAAAINMAKER> Bison stomps
[1:30:51] <+CanonHusbando> straight from the U S of GAPE
[1:30:52] <%InugamiTheHound> who is that robot guy?
[1:30:55] <suikudo> Obviously dragon dildos are more important duh
[1:31:01] <%DracaenaLeaf> Sam is robot
[1:31:03] <rufus2k2> is that the cleaning robot or a different one?
[1:31:08] <%joylent_blue> @billymaze par for the course with this fanbase
[1:31:08] <rufus2k2> well that answers that
[1:31:13] <%InugamiTheHound> damn what a cool cleaning robot
[1:31:15] <%dekkitout> @BillyMaze I think it's about Bad Dragon dildo's liberating the west or something- I'm as lost as you...
[1:31:16] <%BillyMaze> fair enough
[1:31:34] <%XeroSigmaPrime> BECAUSE DRAGON DILDOS REPRESENT FREEDOM, THATS WHY
[1:31:37] <%pectusumbra> Pat would use an acid-spraying cleaning robot
[1:31:44] <%GarbageQueenEllie> @RubberFistFight I don't have any of the answers, but I can still make fun of the current events, and that's ok with me
[1:31:45] <%GarbageNirvana> Like even from a business standpoint alienating a good portion of your home market in an attempt to appeal to a foreign one that may or may not make up for the profits seems ill advised
[1:31:48] <%ape_hawk> ellie is SO right
[1:31:56] <%BillyMaze> "Dragno dildo's represent freedom" ok...
[1:32:01] <%dalmek> that's how you get ghosts
[1:32:02] <+RAAAAAINMAKER> Robot currently has besyt combat stats atm, Pat min maxing obv
[1:32:05] <%strugglepunk2> The Furries will bring China's censorship and pseudo capitalist explotation of free speech to an end.
[1:32:12] <1matheuw> pat the tombraider
[1:32:16] <%cvp5127> @GarbageNirvana but money tho
[1:32:17] <%XeroSigmaPrime> @BillyMaze Don't knock it till you try it hehehe
[1:32:23] <%depressed_skeleton> That guy is the new owner of everything in her enow
[1:32:26] <%dekkitout> @strugglepunk2 And the Juggalos too
[1:32:27] <ALazo> Private property does not exist in the afterlife either
[1:32:28] <%depressed_skeleton> here now*
[1:32:36] <42nfl19> @angriestpat what about inheritence and wills?
[1:32:36] <%BillyMaze> who said I haven't Kappa
[1:32:44] <MissMaggety> Aw man when I went looking for Jameson he was dead
[1:32:53] <%ape_hawk> yeah, FUCK CRANE
[1:32:54] <BurningLlama777> Promotional tie-in product "Raptodon Mauler" available at BadDragon now. Only $19.95 plus shipping.
[1:32:57] <%strugglepunk2> @dekkitout Of course, how could I have forgotten, more the fool I.
[1:32:59] <%RubberFistFight> @GarbageQueenEllie I don't think anybody has a "magic bullet" answer for the situation which is unfortunately what some of the more blindly idealistic people baying for their blood want. Nobody should be attacked for that though. Your position is very valid and nobody should tell you otherwise.
[1:33:05] <%ape_hawk> testing that shit on his coworkers without consent
[1:33:26] <LostCire> Jameson is alive!? He was dead when I got there
[1:33:33] <%InugamiTheHound> @AngriestPat what is your favorite weapon in the game?
[1:33:35] <%GarbageQueenEllie> @RubberFistFight The feeling is mutual.
[1:33:43] <BurningLlama777> Jameson is in the house. Ol' Jameson was born to be wild!
[1:33:44] <+CanonHusbando> literally killing coworkers
[1:33:47] <%GarbageNirvana> ROBITS
[1:34:00] <%BillyMaze> so does someone need to bring up the coke can comparison image?
[1:34:21] <%GarbageNirvana> I dig how you can make any weapon any element with the right mods on this game
[1:34:22] <%dekkitout> Need lore on Coke can, por favor
[1:34:34] <%strugglepunk2> And you're right! Social issues never happen in a vacuum and there are always a variety of contributing factors. that still doesn't mean if someone does a bad, you don't point a finger and inform them that they did a bad.
[1:34:35] <%RubberFistFight> @GarbageQueenEllie yayy, friendly mutual respect. If only more people could be on board with this shit :P
[1:34:36] <Seraphile> just tuning in, did pat save the intern?
[1:34:36] <+TOONFOOD> Done any tinkering yet or saving your bits?
[1:34:57] <BurningLlama777> Did you know that if you soak a steak in Coca Cola overnight it can be a decent marinade
[1:35:10] <Seraphile> its possible to fail if you leave him alone long enough
[1:35:11] <%BillyMaze> there's an image comparing a dragon dildo to a coke can. it's like 3x the length and 2x the width
[1:35:11] <%GarbageQueenEllie> @RubberFistFight Yes, people need to be more chill about stuff.
[1:35:14] <%RubberFistFight> @BurningLlama777 apatWhat
[1:35:17] <%walternatorz> He was dead when I found him
[1:35:19] <%joylent_blue> "hey sit tight while i loot your office place"
[1:35:23] <canolucass> u need to sell all the crap lol
[1:35:31] <Flickerember> Man I wont know what to do when I get this game. Imma try and not go sniper route if there no weird difficulty scaling
[1:35:33] <BurningLlama777> Babyface Jameson
[1:35:34] <%strugglepunk2> "did someone lift the lockdown?" "Nah, just lemme loot the room and I'll seal you back in. Sorry, one sec."
[1:35:37] <%joylent_blue> PogChamp i didn't get that
[1:35:40] <Zebroneath> It's safe to say now that, if you take too long, he'd be dead.
[1:35:43] <%dekkitout> Oh, a Coke-can-dildo, that's not surprising at all
[1:35:52] <+TOONFOOD> Woah I didn't have this either
[1:35:52] <%GarbageQueenEllie> Wow, a game calls your shenanigans "the fiasco"? That's a new one
[1:35:59] <+Maleicus> weird i found him dead
[1:36:02] <%GarbageNirvana> I guess if you take too long to save him he gets merced
[1:36:15] <%joylent_blue> you were cowering in a locked room dude
[1:36:16] <Seraphile> raptidons eat him
[1:36:17] <%PipIV> he gets merced HARD
[1:36:20] <%joylent_blue> you were not saving yourself
[1:36:24] <fIashman92> He was dead when I got there
[1:36:26] <%TheTakkster> WAIT YOU CAN FIND HIM ALIVE??
[1:36:33] <shotgang86> I also found him dead but now I'm glad that I did
[1:36:38] <Kisiel250> you can find him dead?
[1:36:43] <%dekkitout> I don't like the face that this irksome mouth is attached to...
[1:36:43] <%PipIV> I literally did everything first before I got to him
[1:36:45] <%TheTakkster> He was ground beef when i found him
[1:36:45] <TheHeroAppears> LUL
[1:36:49] <%starotter70> LUL
[1:36:53] <Seraphile> its like Eder's story is PoEII
[1:36:53] <%GarbageQueenEllie> These are the kinds of things you should NOT say in front of a chaotic neutral
[1:36:55] <RantingRavager> I found him dead LUL
[1:36:57] <%MrBorisMakarov> yeah i found him dead
[1:36:57] <shotgang86> if you do the other mission first he dies
[1:36:58] <%templar010> Oh really? Kappa
[1:36:59] <fIashman92> Seems like all of us did
[1:37:00] <LostCire> totally found him dead
[1:37:01] <%MaddyCaddy> He was alive for me
[1:37:03] <%blaccbird914> he was alive for me
[1:37:04] <Seraphile> ignore it and the person dies
[1:37:05] <Zebroneath> If you take too long exploring other places, he's dead
[1:37:05] <%GarbageNirvana> I did
[1:37:05] <%TheTakkster> What the fuck
[1:37:06] <%strugglepunk2> He was alive for me
[1:37:06] <%Typhaeon> He was alive for me
[1:37:06] <%dalmek> he was dead for me
[1:37:07] <+MisterRockett> alive for me
[1:37:07] <%RubberFistFight> lol that lady at the end of the Death Stranding trailer, helping Norman Reedus locate King Kai's power level so he can use instant transmission LUL
[1:37:08] <%TubeMan642> He dies if you take to long
[1:37:11] <TechDragon_Z> If you get his research before searching for him he dies offscreen to rapts
[1:37:11] <%Yakobro> I found him alive
[1:37:12] <Gieron667> i found him alive
[1:37:13] <%walternatorz> Yeah, I wonder if it's dependent on which building you enter first
[1:37:15] <globalGinnicide> he was dead when i played
[1:37:17] <TheHeroAppears> time sensitive
[1:37:19] <canolucass> depends on the option u choose
[1:37:24] <%PipIV> missing head and leg
[1:37:27] <mrhooppaw> alive when i played
[1:37:30] <+nekodelic> found him dead as my soul
[1:37:39] <%honeyman18> He died on my playthrough, just a headless corpse.
[1:37:40] <Flickerember> Deus Ex HR tech
[1:37:40] <%GarbageQueenEllie> Let me shoot him in the back, no one has o know!
[1:37:43] <%v1Ables> I found him dead too
[1:37:43] <%TheTakkster> I had no idea you could save him
[1:37:48] <%TheTakkster> wow
[1:37:49] <LostCire> was it a good deed?
[1:37:52] <Monkeyweed21> pats gonna kill them all isnt he
[1:37:56] <%v1Ables> I think it might be timed based on when you pick up the quest
[1:37:56] <%depressed_skeleton> Good deed, for da money
[1:37:59] <+CanonHusbando> I clapped when i saw it
[1:38:00] <Dozale> it was didilicious
[1:38:01] <BurningLlama777> Invisible timers are bad.
[1:38:06] <TimetodiveLTX> hi
[1:38:07] <%nicos143> Is it random? Or is there a prereq to save him?
[1:38:11] <%TheTakkster> It's fine if they only do it once
[1:38:11] <@Moobot> Hey, if you guys feel like checking out The Outer Worlds on account of this stream or cause you think I'm cool, go ahead and use this link https://bit.ly/2JmpB3Q to grab it off Greenman Gaming, and I'll get a few bucks kicked back. Thanks!
[1:38:12] <%v1Ables> too fat
[1:38:17] <1matheuw> chest under stairs
[1:38:18] <Seraphile> its just a matter of time
[1:38:18] <%SGrim> @AngriestPat if you go back, you might see a fight. apatDab
[1:38:19] <shotgang86> wonder if Pat will be an enemy of the board when he arrives at [SPOILER]
[1:38:20] <1matheuw> left side
[1:38:35] <%strugglepunk2> Man, I'm real excited for Disco Elysium. I know it's just a one off (and I get why) but man, that's the type of shit I think pat's going to lose his mind over.
[1:38:35] <BurningLlama777> I'm amazed at how this game has, like... color.
[1:38:37] <Frozenflame01> Pat you just passed a an open chest Under the Stairs
[1:38:42] <%pectusumbra> D R A M A
[1:38:44] <%depressed_skeleton> Fight fight fight fight
[1:38:47] <Flickerember> Cant get em all
[1:38:51] <%strugglepunk2> Still pumped for Outer worlds and DS though
[1:38:52] <Flickerember> Gotta see plot
[1:38:55] <%honeyman18> The writing is really good here at what the notes and story of Roseway imply to be happening in the background of all this. Good shit.
[1:38:56] <LostCire> Roseway is far prettier than the spacers choice place
[1:39:03] <Flickerember> Where is NV orange and mroe orange
[1:39:06] <%GarbageQueenEllie> Color is something the Fallout games had severely lacking.
[1:39:14] <%SGrim> @AngriestPat it looks like he isn't here yet.
[1:39:16] <Dementedpenguin> DansGame
[1:39:26] <%strugglepunk2> literally nothing but good shit coming up. Thanks pat.
[1:39:39] <BurningLlama777> Hmmm...
[1:39:49] <%SGrim> @AngriestPat or maybe he never arrives. You did make different choices than I did.
[1:40:01] <%joylent_blue> god we need games to stop coming out with the abbreviation "DS"
[1:40:11] <+drakthebest> Just hopping in for a recommendation to Pat: carry around armor/helmets with different skill bonuses to pass those skillchecks, this becomes especially relevent with a level 3 perk that doubles skill bonuses from armor
[1:40:13] <%honeyman18> BREAK HIM
[1:40:15] <%nicos143> Shoot him
[1:40:17] <TimetodiveLTX> thats a big admit
[1:40:20] <Flickerember> Bop him
[1:40:22] <1matheuw> i bet this byzantium is a worse shithole
[1:40:24] <$StarlitStunner> cecevrS
[1:40:25] <Flickerember> Love tat with big hammer
[1:40:26] <%starotter70> Douter Sworlds
[1:40:31] <+AllenDeadman> did he do the lighter quest already?
[1:40:34] <+RAAAAAINMAKER> Well then Pat's clearly selling his research
[1:40:37] <shotgang86> [glass hom]
[1:40:38] <%RubberFistFight> @joylent_blue nintendo's New 3DS XL DS2 - now with twice as much DS!
[1:40:39] <Seraphile> byzantium is a great place for early retirement
[1:40:40] <%strugglepunk2> "I have to get to the golden city where all the rich people live because it's good there! Don't you SEE? IT"S ALL WORTH IT!!!"
[1:40:48] <BurningLlama777> @1matheuw Are you saying that a place in fiction built up to be a paradise might be... *not?!!?*
[1:40:54] <%rumtumtugnutz> @joylent_blue I have seen no proof that Death Stranding is actually a game, so DS is still Dark Souls.
[1:40:56] <%GarbageQueenEllie> Hey did CheeseWhiz get da gurl?
[1:41:03] <%depressed_skeleton> Moon gang.
[1:41:12] <1matheuw> @BurningLlama777 can you imagine the horror?!?
[1:41:14] <BurningLlama777> Mood Gange
[1:41:22] <Flickerember> p l a s m a
[1:41:27] <%depressed_skeleton> Chunky
[1:41:31] <BurningLlama777> @1matheuw I already fainted!
[1:41:32] <%rumtumtugnutz> I'm no longer sure Parcheesi is the best girl cause I like the other other one.
[1:41:33] <+TOONFOOD> fat roll
[1:41:34] <%Finaldragoon> S L O W G A N G
[1:41:36] <Seraphile> break weapons for parts
[1:41:41] <+RAAAAAINMAKER> Apparently the IGN review on Death Stranding has a ton of spoilers
[1:41:41] <%dalmek> @AngriestPat you can break down weapons/armour to get parts, and lose weight
[1:41:48] <%strugglepunk2> MARK 2 BAY BEEEEEE
[1:41:53] <%rumtumtugnutz> Yeah better weapons are better
[1:41:53] <+AllenDeadman> big pewpew
[1:41:54] <%dalmek> in your inventory, I mean to say
[1:41:54] <%v1Ables> @AngriestPat the only thing different between these assholes and Byzantium is Byzantium assholes are bleached
[1:41:55] <%strugglepunk2> TIME FOR THE GOOD SHIT
[1:42:00] <+CanonHusbando> tier 3 weapons babey
[1:42:04] <%TheTakkster> You might want to consider dumping about half of your adreno on the ship
[1:42:04] <%dekkitout> Biggest of numbaz
[1:42:04] <Dozale> Ellie's VO & barks are bad yo, was way better in the demo a year ago
[1:42:06] <Flickerember> They eat meol at Byzantian
[1:42:07] <%InugamiTheHound> yamato mark 2
[1:42:08] <LodiFrostbeard> a lot of people are saying DS is boring AF
[1:42:10] <%joylent_blue> ign gave it a 6.9 or something didn't they???
[1:42:11] <BurningLlama777> I like how the pistols cause bleed. Not like other gunshots
[1:42:17] <%joylent_blue> that shocked me
[1:42:22] <%WalksWithFate> WalksWithFate subscribed at Tier 1. 
[1:42:24] <%GarbageQueenEllie> Give moon me the big gun
[1:42:27] <Flickerember> serrated booletz
[1:42:35] <TimetodiveLTX> i knew ign was bullshit when i was 15
[1:42:37] <%dabeaminator> Put plasma damage on that pistol and it rocks. I‚Äôm still using it on Monarch.
[1:42:40] <%RubberFistFight> @joylent_blue lol, giving a shit what IGN thinks in 2019.
[1:42:43] <%rumtumtugnutz> @joylent_blue The developers couldn't afford to buy a better score.
[1:42:43] <Seraphile> Death stranding apparently has a 45 minute ending cutscene
[1:42:44] <%honeyman18> More of a if you like them, the enemies should start dropping them now
[1:42:51] <Seraphile> honestly shorter than i expected
[1:43:06] <%BLK_HRLQN_13> BLK_HRLQN_13 subscribed with Twitch Prime. They've subscribed for 6 months! Yay ^w^
[1:43:18] <%dekkitout> Yup. Dassa whol ass pistol, with a whol lotta damage
[1:43:21] <Monkeyweed21> Mod it for shock damage
[1:43:29] <%strugglepunk2> It seems like it'll be the opposite of MGSV Increadibly interesting story, Terrible and dull gameplay looped all the time.
[1:43:32] <BurningLlama777> I really like "gun sounds" in games. Not just the gunshots, but those little "ch-chack" sounds. You know?
[1:43:42] <%dalmek> @AngriestPat Hold X on something in your inv. to break it down. Useful for weight management.
[1:43:42] <%rumtumtugnutz> The upgraded Bolter pistol is pretty tight
[1:43:43] <canolucass> fallout games suck imo, luckily this game is more like mass effect in dynamics and gameplay
[1:43:46] <%honeyman18> any element increases damage a lot for high science characters
[1:43:48] <%WalksWithFate> The ch-chacks are what sells me on the guns in games tbh
[1:43:55] <+RAAAAAINMAKER> So just watch all the cutscenes cobbled together on youtube
[1:43:56] <BurningLlama777> @WalksWithFate *high fives*
[1:44:00] <%GarbageQueenEllie> @BurningLlama777 You'd really like gun-sync videos.
[1:44:00] <Flickerember> bolt action noises intensifes
[1:44:11] <%rumtumtugnutz> But I dunno if you can get that before you get to the next Corporate Butthole
[1:44:12] <Monkeyweed21> Mod the pistol for shock damage
[1:44:18] <+Finch_9001> Did you see the option in settings to show DPS after your stat modifiers? More accurate.
[1:44:18] <BurningLlama777> @GarbageQueenEllie I'll have to look into those! *tactical reloads*
[1:44:23] <%strugglepunk2> Waddle faster for our amusement, moon man.
[1:44:45] <%joylent_blue> accidentally store all your stimpacks
[1:44:46] <%WalksWithFate> I will say, I wish using consumables was like, just a bit quicker, otherwise Outerworlds is dope
[1:44:48] <mrhooppaw> breaking duplicates down for parts is so much better since selling only gives minimum bits
[1:45:11] <%RubberFistFight> oh my god I just read something about the WoW expansion that's got me fucking hot blooded and pissed off again
[1:45:13] <%dekkitout> Ya did it~
[1:45:16] <1matheuw> hey you can buy that navkey cash upfront now
[1:45:19] <%joylent_blue> selling shit to vending machines is so handy
[1:45:26] <%SomeSageAdvice> was it the removal of the starting areas? @RubberFistFight
[1:45:29] <Monkeyweed21> @AngriestPat Mod shock onto the pistol so you can replace your shitty shock cannon
[1:45:31] <+RAAAAAINMAKER> The new wow looks like a mobile game
[1:45:32] <LostCire> man thats a bummer. new better pistol still looks the same, no difference except in the damage
[1:45:36] <%GarbageQueenEllie> @RubberFistFight Tell us the story
[1:45:38] <%strugglepunk2> @RubberFistFight It's real bad this time, again.
[1:45:38] <%faldin> is it the level squash?
[1:45:43] <%RubberFistFight> They're letting Pandaren be Death Knights. Even though they spent a long time REFUSING to, for very, very clearly-stated reasons. WHO GIVES A FUCK ABOUT LORE AMIRITE?
[1:45:44] <%InugamiTheHound> the only healing item is that mask. I wish other healing items could help you up like in fallout
[1:45:47] <+Maleicus> or you could go the hard way like a man
[1:45:51] <%crimsonharvest> I think you mean Goblin Shredder
[1:45:52] <BurningLlama777> Niiice
[1:45:56] <Flickerember> Das why I like shootbangs
[1:45:58] <%dekkitout> @RubberFistFight Is it cause this is the third expansion to a recent, well known game with the word "Shadow" in the title?
[1:46:06] <%Walkerartorias> @AngriestPat you know you can dismantle in your inventory menu if you wanna quickly lower your weight
[1:46:06] <%InugamiTheHound> BOOM HEADSHOT!-FPS Doug
[1:46:10] <%strugglepunk2> Also, y'know, sylvanas soloing the army of the dead and Bolvar
[1:46:15] <1matheuw> is just me or is sam slowly becoming a psycho machina
[1:46:18] <grayjammer> Stealth Archer
[1:46:19] <+RAAAAAINMAKER> Diablo 4 looks sick though, even though I don't care for it
[1:46:25] <LodiFrostbeard> ez gaem
[1:46:26] <%joylent_blue> wait what was the 3rd expansion with shadow in the title
[1:46:30] <+AllenDeadman> that one flew appart holly crap
[1:46:30] <%RubberFistFight> @dekkitout no, it's because they've gathered up all of the story thus far, put it on a plate, and taken a GIANT STEAMING SHIT ON IT. And then set it on fire and thrown it out the window.
[1:46:34] <%joylent_blue> LUL
[1:46:37] <Flickerember> Mah legs
[1:46:37] <rufus2k2> FREE CANDY
[1:46:41] <%strugglepunk2> because HAHAHAHA she's all the best and shit and we need a villian with an excuse to pull some bullshit
[1:46:41] <%Jack_of_No_Trades> look out!
[1:46:44] <rufus2k2> *THOOM*
[1:46:46] <%InugamiTheHound> one shot, one kill
[1:46:47] <+G_Thunders> Well on hard mode it definitely didn‚Äôt play like this, that‚Äôs for sure
[1:46:48] <Monkeyweed21> TAKE IT
[1:46:48] <%joylent_blue> oh man
[1:46:48] <LodiFrostbeard> TTAKE IT
[1:46:49] <+CanonHusbando> this one isn't terrible
[1:46:49] <OToole42> screw that flaw
[1:46:49] <1matheuw> careful pat bombs
[1:46:50] <+RAAAAAINMAKER> Take it
[1:46:53] <%GarbageNirvana> @inugamithehound There's a perk in this game called that, makes people's heads explode and do some dmg
[1:46:53] <%v1Ables> THAT WORTH IT
[1:46:55] <%ape_hawk> TAKE TAKE TAKE
[1:46:58] <%joylent_blue> take it coward
[1:46:58] <TheHeroAppears> ew
[1:46:58] <%TheTakkster> Take it. the game is too easy
[1:47:00] <%WalksWithFate> Nah
[1:47:00] <+RAAAAAINMAKER> Don't get hit dummy
[1:47:00] <mrhooppaw> WORTH
[1:47:01] <%SGrim> @AngriestPat worth
[1:47:01] <@commanderclaw> Pretty good one
[1:47:01] <%ape_hawk> DO IT, COWARD
[1:47:02] <+CanonHusbando> it's just melee damage and explosives
[1:47:02] <%GarbageNirvana> AoE dmg that is
[1:47:02] <%v1Ables> with how your armor will be scaling
[1:47:02] <%GarbageQueenEllie> @RubberFistFight Sorry about that. Reminds me of when I found out about the Revan expansion in SWTOR.
[1:47:03] <canolucass> free piercing for you !
[1:47:05] <%bread_assassin> That seems ike the worst flaw.
[1:47:05] <+AllenDeadman> it's ALL physical damage, mele, ranged, explosions
[1:47:06] <ManlyMcBeefington> you are not on hard, sees perfect
[1:47:06] <LodiFrostbeard> ITS WORTH IT
[1:47:07] <Datsanegg> Just don't get hit 4Head
[1:47:07] <%Piemen99> DO IT DO IT
[1:47:07] <%dekkitout> So they did the same as many stories have been within recent memory...
[1:47:08] <BurningLlama777> Really? 25% sounds like a lot...
[1:47:09] <Seraphile> this is probably the least worst
[1:47:12] <%strugglepunk2> What flaws does pat have so far?
[1:47:13] <+RAAAAAINMAKER> It is
[1:47:14] <%pectusumbra> that's the most reasonable one so far
[1:47:16] <%Piemen99> DO IT COWARD DO IT
[1:47:17] <Dozale> are you SOFT and vulnerable? Ask yourself.
[1:47:19] <mrhooppaw> all of the 25% ones are really worth it
[1:47:20] <Monkeyweed21> Take it game is EZ already
[1:47:21] <%strugglepunk2> other than, y'know, being pat
[1:47:22] <%GarbageNirvana> Just wear more armor 4head
[1:47:22] <fIashman92> All damage+ is worth it
[1:47:23] <%strugglepunk2> Gottem
[1:47:23] <%Ner234> 25% sounds like a LOT.
[1:47:24] <Naoyin> do it!!
[1:47:25] <%WalksWithFate> Oh no flaws? Absolutely take it
[1:47:26] <NeroInfinite> That flaw is fine
[1:47:29] <%goose_attack_almanac> whatever you need totell yourself
[1:47:31] <Seraphile> i took robophobia, which is fun for RP
[1:47:32] <LostCire> eh up to you
[1:47:32] <%cvp5127> reset
[1:47:35] <TheHeroAppears> hold that flaw
[1:47:36] <%Piemen99> YEYEYEYEYEYYEYEYE
[1:47:37] <BurningLlama777> Yeah but what about in the game @AngriestPat ? 8D
[1:47:37] <%v1Ables> highly reccomend recharge on crit
[1:47:38] <LodiFrostbeard> RUN RUINED
[1:47:38] <%dekkitout> That's like a Dark Souls ring
[1:47:40] <Flickerember> So everyone is ippo now with landing a liverblow opens you up for a gazelle punch
[1:47:41] <+CanonHusbando> just don't get hit forehead
[1:47:42] <NeroInfinite> It'sbetter than anyhtign at activly affects stats
[1:47:43] <%arancet> youre flawed pat
[1:47:44] <%strugglepunk2> Food addiction is pretty hype.
[1:47:47] <%GarbageQueenEllie> You are now no longer a Moony Stue
[1:47:47] <+Caped_Eggy> Flawless no moar PepeHands
[1:47:48] <%RubberFistFight> @strugglepunk2 yeah I was vocally displeased with GodMode Windrunner. I actually started shouting. Last time I got that pissed off at a screen was Darth Vader's edited-in "NooOOooOOoo" in the ROTJ bluray.
[1:47:50] <%ShogunNoonto> what flaw did he take ?
[1:47:51] <%cvp5127> unpure
[1:47:51] <%MalekDracarus> Kalamet ring baby
[1:47:53] <%pectusumbra> Reaper Reaper Reaper
[1:47:54] <%dekkitout> Take more damage, but your poise goes up
[1:47:55] <%joylent_blue> i took Robophobia without really thinking, now i have a phobia debuff whenever SAM is in my party @AngriestPat
[1:47:56] <%dabeaminator> Given how easy this game is on normal, you‚Äôll be fine.
[1:47:57] <fruit_pie_the_magician> Softy Moon Boivin
[1:48:01] <%Tucker0603> LIFE STEAL spyYum spyYum
[1:48:03] <%pectusumbra> Reaper Man BABY
[1:48:05] <+RAAAAAINMAKER> Physical weakness flaw
[1:48:05] <BurningLlama777> @strugglepunk2 I'm totally addicted to food. I'd simply *die* without it.
[1:48:10] <%joylent_blue> i have to tell him to follow me at a distance LUL
[1:48:11] <%strugglepunk2> @RubberFistFight WITH HER BARE HANDS
[1:48:14] <@Fuggins4U> Fuggins4U subscribed with Twitch Prime. They've subscribed for 8 months! This for Elmo's college.
[1:48:18] <%strugglepunk2> GOD AS MY WITNESS
[1:48:23] <thehashslingingslashers> The food addiction flaw is one of the best flaws
[1:48:25] <+CanonHusbando> food addiction on supernova is chill because you have to eat all the time anyways
[1:48:28] <%pectusumbra> Absolutely your style
[1:48:28] <%strugglepunk2> Emlo do good schoolz
[1:48:30] <+RAAAAAINMAKER> Good choice
[1:48:31] <%dalmek> Reaper + Multiple sniper headshots is DOPE
[1:48:31] <%v1Ables> noicu
[1:48:37] <%joylent_blue> Reaper and Harvester are great
[1:48:42] <%GarbageNirvana> I got drug addiction and plasma weakness by the end of my run
[1:48:44] <%BillyMaze> But now the gobalins won't shut up abouit not being the PERFECT moon man
[1:48:45] <Seraphile> @joylent_blue i took that flaw too, and it was only until a friend told me that i realised where my new dialogue option for SAM came from AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAA
[1:48:49] <%strugglepunk2> reaper+kill healing is game breaking
[1:48:53] <+CanonHusbando> grim reaper's sprint builds in this are fun as hell too
[1:49:08] <%joylent_blue> Seraphile i THOUGHT thats what the option was from LUL thats great
[1:49:10] <%RubberFistFight> @strugglepunk2 Who would win? The Lich King, former lieutenant of the Burning Legion and practically DEATH INCARNATE and his entire army - versus - one shooty undead girl.
[1:49:14] <%GarbageQueenEllie> Auntie Cleo sounds like some European mafia shit

[1:50:03] <%RubberFistFight> @GarbageNirvana I took drug addiction because i misread the penalty and only realised after i was several hours past it, what the downside REALLY was.
[1:50:03] <%joylent_blue> you cannot, in fact, jump over Cascadia's walls
[1:50:07] <%GarbageQueenEllie> @mrhooppaw awesome.
[1:50:22] <%InugamiTheHound> sprat?
[1:50:28] <+HyraFukit> You killed a sprat! You are awful
[1:50:42] <%dekkitout> Space-rat, hence sprat
[1:50:46] <%WalksWithFate> Sprats are delicious

[1:51:59] <%dalmek> This helmet? It extends my arms for further lockpicking
[1:52:04] <BurningLlama777> Gotcha, gotcha. Game still seems quality of course.
[1:52:05] <+CanonHusbando> sa and max
[1:52:05] <%dalmek> It hurts but the Loot is worth it

[1:52:11] <%depressed_skeleton> Pat don't bully SAM cause he doesn't have a head.
[1:52:15] <canolucass> @BurningLlama777 hmm not that much, like a fortnite map more or less
[1:52:16] <+CanonHusbando> holy shit you can party with sam and max
[1:52:18] <rufus2k2> SAM looking to go to Bosstown Dynamics Training school
[1:52:29] <+CanonHusbando> i just got that
[1:52:31] <BurningLlama777> Well you know what they say, size isn't everyth*sobs*
[1:52:33] <Seraphile> agraphobia was the first flaw i was offered...
[1:52:37] <%strugglepunk2> @CanonHusbando Oh. I can never not use them now.
[1:52:41] <%v1Ables> they stopped expanding so they prob sealed off everything
[1:52:52] <1matheuw> shoot the barrels i wanna see something explode
[1:53:01] <+CanonHusbando> YEET
[1:53:06] <+RAAAAAINMAKER> Shock the System
[1:53:12] <%TheTakkster> Those big boys are weak in the ankles
[1:53:12] <@Moobot> Hey, if you guys feel like checking out The Outer Worlds on account of this stream or cause you think I'm cool, go ahead and use this link https://bit.ly/2JmpB3Q to grab it off Greenman Gaming, and I'll get a few bucks kicked back. Thanks!
[1:53:13] <+KSabot> why that guy doing backflips lol
[1:53:29] <+Maleicus> from the force of the bullets
[1:53:35] <%strugglepunk2> guys how hard is pat gonna nut when he gets a mark two sniper?
[1:53:36] <%RyuuAoi> We Worlds or Wilds tonight and which is Pat's GOTY?
[1:53:40] <%InugamiTheHound> damn what a awesome marksman rifle. If you add a mod to it give it a bigger magazine it would be better
[1:53:43] <+TOONFOOD> Does the snipe have a mod in it?
[1:53:59] <%depressed_skeleton> fat snake
[1:54:01] <+Maleicus> it all leads to the same place
[1:54:04] <LostCire> chonk snek says hi
[1:54:07] <%joylent_blue> how did you hit THAT guy
[1:54:11] <+MisterRockett> What gun is this?!
[1:54:14] <+RAAAAAINMAKER> Shot the groin for immediate stun
[1:54:27] <%dekkitout> "Kill his dick"
[1:54:30] <%joylent_blue> never heal
[1:54:34] <%joylent_blue> aww
[1:54:34] <+HyraFukit> @joylent_blue hitboxes that are meant to feel good not exactly be super precise I think
[1:54:38] <rufus2k2> well that was a horrible way to die
[1:54:40] <+RAAAAAINMAKER> Groins shots has a stun animation
[1:54:42] <%GarbageNirvana> Snipin's a good job mate
[1:54:48] <BurningLlama777> Yeah that looks like it hurts
[1:54:52] <%SergeEXE> It's outta doors
[1:54:55] <BurningLlama777> Only a few seconds, though...?
[1:54:59] <%Bobbledygook> I LOVE YOU SAM
[1:55:03] <%strugglepunk2> has pat been tinkering at all?
[1:55:06] <%rumtumtugnutz> @MisterRockett Are you asking about the deadeye rifle or the plasma carbine?
[1:55:10] <%strugglepunk2> Or does he not get the system?
[1:55:16] <1matheuw> isnt sam just a walking war crime?
[1:55:19] <BurningLlama777> I mean, excruciating agony for 3 seconds might not be too bad...?
[1:55:28] <%rumtumtugnutz> SAM is a Janitor
[1:55:32] <%InugamiTheHound> killing some with laser weapons reminds me of deaths from fallout 3 and mass effect Andromeda
[1:55:37] <%honeyman18> Sam should literally have options to clean crime scenes and crap.
[1:55:41] <rufus2k2> SHOOT HER
[1:55:41] <%rumtumtugnutz> SHOOT HER
[1:55:42] <%XeroSigmaPrime> SHOOT
[1:55:42] <%dekkitout> Sam is more of a "cleaner"
[1:55:47] <1matheuw> SHOOT PAT
[1:55:47] <%joylent_blue> noooooo
[1:55:48] <%honeyman18> she okay
[1:55:48] <BurningLlama777> Noooo don't shooot
[1:55:53] <%gespenst25> Daga kotowaru!
[1:55:53] <+Snorlax321> shoot coward
[1:55:54] <%WalksWithFate> @honeyman18 One of his perk options is essentially that
[1:55:56] <rufus2k2> BOO
[1:55:58] <@Fuggins4U> i'm proud of him for not shooting
[1:55:58] <%TheTakkster> Does Sam ever....evolve?
[1:56:00] <%honeyman18> She got a quest.
[1:56:01] <CrypticMochi> Shoot da hoe!
[1:56:02] <1matheuw> big coward energy
[1:56:06] <%Tucker0603> CUTIE
[1:56:09] <BurningLlama777> Nice is best. :(
[1:56:11] <%GarbageQueenEllie> She kind of looks like she's smiling at you
[1:56:27] <BurningLlama777> Dreamworks Face!
[1:56:36] <%TheTakkster> @GarbageQueenEllie That the scar tissue yanking her lip up
[1:56:36] <%rumtumtugnutz> @Fuggins4U Boooooo
[1:57:08] <%honeyman18> Her Butt has Bugs
[1:57:09] <+CanonHusbando> "i'm on my fuckin smoke break"
[1:57:10] <+Caped_Eggy> Sounds like brok for a sec there
[1:57:11] <%Tucker0603> sweaty spyYum spyYum spyYum
[1:57:11] <%GarbageQueenEllie> @TheTakkster Imma call her "Smiley Lilly"
[1:57:15] <rufus2k2> are there actually any ciggarrette item drops?
[1:57:15] <%joylent_blue> ohhh you can probably offer her one if you do have one
[1:57:19] <%Bobbledygook> booty buggies
[1:57:23] <+Maleicus> yes
[1:57:26] <+RAAAAAINMAKER> cigarettes are eerywhere
[1:57:29] <%joylent_blue> there are cigs yeah
[1:57:33] <%TheTakkster> @GarbageQueenEllie Not Silly Lilly?
[1:57:35] <+RAAAAAINMAKER> Yjeir are like 5 different brands
[1:57:35] <BurningLlama777> Why does the body make scar tissue that sucks compared to the original tissue? The body has DNA, it remembers what the original tissue was right?
[1:57:37] <%joylent_blue> stogies
[1:57:39] <rufus2k2> shame pat probably junked em
[1:57:41] <@Fuggins4U> Dylaaannn
[1:57:42] <+CanonHusbando> you can totally give her a smoke if you have them
[1:57:44] <%GarbageQueenEllie> @TheTakkster Ohhh better!
[1:57:56] <%TheTakkster> ^^
[1:57:58] <Seraphile> cigarettes are any consumable that gives the "nicotine" buff
[1:57:59] <%rumtumtugnutz> Imma call her Philip because some of you might understand why.
[1:58:01] <+RAAAAAINMAKER> fetch quest
[1:58:08] <%dekkitout> Newstip, the human body is sub-optimal at healing sometimes
[1:58:08] <T_Sasquatch> Mhmmm cigarettes
[1:58:20] <%Deft_Thought> Momma didn't raise no dumbasses!
[1:58:24] <BurningLlama777> @dekkitout *head explodes*
[1:58:26] <+RAAAAAINMAKER> It's close, it's like down the hill
[1:58:28] <%WalksWithFate> Oh well you can't *not* get her lucky case
[1:58:29] <%joylent_blue> wow Ellie
[1:58:33] <%joylent_blue> she can hear you
[1:58:34] <%honeyman18> I think it's like, you glue shit back fast, not reforge it from scratch. so you have scar tissue
[1:58:46] <%WalksWithFate> Essentially what Honey said, yea
[1:58:55] <%WalksWithFate> Scar tissue is like Skin's version of duct tape
[1:58:55] <%Bobbledygook> fuck, i forgot about moon gang
[1:58:56] <+CanonHusbando> I like her
[1:59:00] <%Jack_of_No_Trades> Ow! My Parts!
[1:59:05] <ThanksVideogames9> is this the full game?
[1:59:07] <globalGinnicide> didnt know you could talk to her, I murdered her ass immedately
[1:59:11] <T_Sasquatch> Has pat talked about death stranding reviews ?
[1:59:15] <%Tucker0603> she's cool
[1:59:15] <%joylent_blue> the only problem with SAM is that he can't wear a moon mask
[1:59:15] <+RAAAAAINMAKER> SHhhhh Secret
[1:59:18] <BurningLlama777> @Walkerartorias Fair enough. Good analogy.
[1:59:26] <%depressed_skeleton> Sssh Secret lab
[1:59:33] <%rumtumtugnutz> I think this quest is literally to show you where the secret entrance is
[1:59:34] <%pectusumbra> hahahahahahahahahah. That cracks me up honestly
[1:59:34] <%honeyman18> BIG SECRET LABS HERE
[1:59:40] <LostCire> gotta advertise that secretness
[1:59:40] <%Bobbledygook> BIG SECRET NO TOUCH
[1:59:45] <%ape_hawk> pat, we LITERALLY have Area 51
[1:59:47] <%WalksWithFate> Reverse psychology
[1:59:49] <%Bobbledygook> let everyone know how secret it is
[1:59:52] <$Taisuru> I'm a little sad Blizzard has completely killed my interest in games I'd otherwise be excited for
[1:59:58] <%joylent_blue> dude was tying his shoes pvpWhy
[2:00:00] <%Bobbledygook> ^^
[2:00:02] <1matheuw> YOU SHOT HIM ON THE DICK PAT
[2:00:09] <BurningLlama777> @Taisuru Same. I'm not interested in their stuff anymore.
[2:00:09] <%WalksWithFate> He should b
[2:00:12] <rufus2k2> christ
[2:00:12] <%honeyman18> Honestly who's even on this shithole planet to find it though?
[2:00:13] <%v1Ables> Beurocracy demands we label everything. "But then what do we name the secret lab?"
[2:00:15] <+RAAAAAINMAKER> The groin, the groin is the weakspot
[2:00:18] <%Finaldragoon> is Sam a robot, or just in a power suit?
[2:00:18] <+CanonHusbando> what if it's not a real secret lab and it's just a front, but what if they expect you to ignore it knowing that it's a front and it really is the secret labs
[2:00:23] <%WalksWithFate> Theres an achievment for shooting 50 people in the dick in slow mo
[2:00:27] <%joylent_blue> SAM is 100% robot
[2:00:32] <mrhooppaw> @1matheuw there's an achievement for dick shooting btw
[2:00:45] <%rumtumtugnutz> This isn;t Sniper Elite 3, you don't get bonus points for shooting off Nazi testicles.
[2:00:53] <Seraphile> yep
[2:00:53] <%joylent_blue> oh my god i hadn't looked at the trophy list yet
[2:00:53] <+RAAAAAINMAKER> Yeah 30 groin shots
[2:00:55] <BurningLlama777> Can you imagine how miserable realistic mines in games would be? Ie. buried, invisible?
[2:00:56] <%joylent_blue> thats amazing
[2:01:00] <%WalksWithFate> Is it 30 or 50?
[2:01:02] <%dalmek> PAT THE MINE! WATCH OUT
[2:01:02] <%Ner234> Pat watch out
[2:01:07] <$Taisuru> You only have 89 heals left Pat!
[2:01:07] <%GarbageNirvana> @taisuru If it's any consolation the people responsible for the games you do love are most likely out there making other games like that
[2:01:09] <+CanonHusbando> pat watch out
[2:01:13] <+CanonHusbando> it's a mine
[2:01:15] <%Bobbledygook> pat look out
[2:01:16] <%honeyman18> Mines Suck, wish you could disarm them
[2:01:18] <%dabeaminator> LOOK OUT
[2:01:22] <%CrabSlacks> @AngriestPat the mine pat
[2:01:43] <%BillyMaze> New Flaw: Micropenis Bonus: Get shot in the dick less
[2:01:53] <BurningLlama777> Ha ha ha
[2:01:57] <Flickerember> in the dick
[2:01:59] <%dekkitout> That sounds like a top tier flaw
[2:02:20] <%joylent_blue> i thought durability loss was super slow in the early game, now i'm losing like 10%~ in a single gunfight
[2:02:30] <$Taisuru> Is it a setting or a perk to see damage numbers and time dilation effects?
[2:02:35] <%honeyman18> Meh, Ada doesnt have a port so who cares.
[2:02:40] <%WalksWithFate> Setting
[2:02:48] <+A123yourdead> It‚Äôs aliens
[2:02:51] <+TOONFOOD> I think everybody tried disarming the mines first time üòÅ
[2:02:53] <%Jack_of_No_Trades> look out!
[2:02:57] <mrhooppaw> ive noticed the heavy machine guns degrade in like a couple fights
[2:03:00] <%Tucker0603> @honeyman18 we can make one spyYum
[2:03:11] <%TheTakkster> Ada has a lot of places she likes to have......cleaned by sam
[2:03:19] <mrhooppaw> thats why breaking down equipment instead of selling is super useful
[2:03:23] <%honeyman18> Yeah well good luck keeping SAM out, bastard.
[2:03:26] <%GarbageQueenEllie> Samada Top Tier
[2:03:32] <%joylent_blue> yeah my big dick heavy machine gun gets low so quick pvpWhy
[2:03:38] <Seraphile> pat if you consume somethign that boosts your stats, you can usually boost your lockpick so the # of magpicks drops from 2 to 0
[2:03:41] <%honeyman18> Worst random interactions
[2:03:52] <+BrunoDup> How did you get so many money?
[2:04:07] <%WalksWithFate> Business
[2:04:13] <Monkeyweed21> Mod pistol for shock damage
[2:04:14] <%maximemeretrax> ‚ÄúSo I‚Äôve done some grinding‚Äù
[2:04:27] <%TheTakkster> Oh yeah weapon tiers....jump a bit
[2:04:38] <nademonkey1100> MUGNUM?!
[2:04:39] <%honeyman18> Yeah, you will dump all the weapons over time.
[2:04:48] <%dekkitout> Give it surrounded spec SeriousSloth
[2:04:51] <%joylent_blue> the MUGNUM parts
[2:04:52] <Seraphile> buy mods
[2:04:59] <%TheTakkster> All the mods are back on the ship
[2:05:09] <Monkeyweed21> Mod a pistol for shock damage for robits
[2:05:12] <Seraphile> use mods
[2:05:17] <%joylent_blue> i keep all my mods on me like a crazy person
[2:05:21] <%TheTakkster> Shock damage is amazing
[2:05:27] <TheHeroAppears> do a big mod
[2:05:35] <Seraphile> corrosive is gucci
[2:05:36] <%GarbageNirvana> Mods come up pretty often
[2:05:45] <+TOONFOOD> @joylent_blue same, they add a crap load of weight too
[2:05:48] <+FierceDeityGabe> Is shock dmg strictly better than normal dmg?
[2:05:50] <%patriotrenegade> Boy you‚Äôre character looks like a jack-ass
[2:05:50] <%rumtumtugnutz> Corrosive is great against meat targets.
[2:05:53] <%TheTakkster> I think the only bad damage types are kinetic and n-ray because it's too situational
[2:06:01] <%TheTakkster> kinetic is always bad
[2:06:08] <+RAAAAAINMAKER> You have high science, use plasma or shock weapons
[2:06:10] <Monkeyweed21> plasma rifle
[2:06:17] <%joylent_blue> Corrosive is great against everything pretty much
[2:06:17] <@lewdskeletor13> Howdy y‚Äôall, what have I missed?
[2:06:22] <%GarbageNirvana> Corrosive is a pretty solid overall damage type
[2:06:27] <+FierceDeityGabe> It's too vague
[2:06:28] <%joylent_blue> pat stepped on more mines
[2:06:29] <fruit_pie_the_magician> @AngriestPat Sam already does corrosive, so equip elli with a heavy modded shock weapon and then you can use plasma
[2:06:30] <%honeyman18> Shock has no downside and bonus damage
[2:06:34] <Seraphile> n-ray is good on a low damage high rpm
[2:06:37] <%rumtumtugnutz> @FierceDeityGabe Not strictly, no. It's better versus robots, so since robots are generally kinda damage spongey it's useful.
[2:06:54] <Seraphile> cause it ignores armor
[2:07:12] <%dekkitout> So corrosion = spacers choice(but sctually legit good)
[2:07:13] <Seraphile> corrosive is ol'reliable
[2:07:13] <%honeyman18> Nary halves damage
[2:07:17] <+HyraFukit> Corrosion is the best?
[2:07:18] <%v1Ables> Corrosion is better than anything
[2:07:19] <%joylent_blue> basically Corrosion is OP
[2:07:26] <%v1Ables> Shock has no weaknesses
[2:07:27] <Monkeyweed21> use the flamethrower
[2:07:35] <%rumtumtugnutz> Corrosion is my favorite
[2:07:37] <@lewdskeletor13> Plasma is very useful
[2:07:39] <Seraphile> plasma is super effective of raptidons
[2:07:41] <%LiquidShake83> mod the rake
[2:07:44] <%GarbageNirvana> Plasma isn't great against armored stuff
[2:07:47] <+fingalights> respect the flesh
[2:07:54] <%honeyman18> Corrosive flamethrower just sprays acid, green goop.
[2:08:02] <Seraphile> if you see corrosive weapon mods, buy them
[2:08:03] <%dabeaminator> Corrosive is only for melee weapons so far
[2:08:05] <Monkeyweed21> a gun for every range
[2:08:20] <BurningLlama777> FINALLY
[2:08:20] <@Moobot> Hey, if you guys feel like checking out The Outer Worlds on account of this stream or cause you think I'm cool, go ahead and use this link https://bit.ly/2JmpB3Q to grab it off Greenman Gaming, and I'll get a few bucks kicked back. Thanks!
[2:08:22] <Seraphile> mag-2-melt is the corrosive gun mod
[2:08:22] <%joylent_blue> Corrosive mods definitely exist for ranged weapons too
[2:08:28] <BurningLlama777> Mating habits yeeeah!
[2:08:33] <BurningLlama777> oH...
[2:08:44] <%TheTakkster> Just like my ex wife
[2:08:49] <+RAAAAAINMAKER> Make thePandas fuck
[2:08:49] <%rumtumtugnutz> @dabeaminator There are gun modes for corrosive.
[2:08:51] <BurningLlama777> Heyoooo
[2:08:53] <TheHeroAppears> if they are immune to music they must be smart
[2:09:09] <%CaityCoopScoops> Fraiser is canon in Outer Worlds
[2:09:36] <Seraphile> Cleo employees seem to have a bit more free thought than spacer choice
[2:09:39] <+RAAAAAINMAKER> They're expensive
[2:09:40] <%rumtumtugnutz> Something something Tossed Salad and Scrambled Eggs
[2:09:40] <1matheuw> careful pat
[2:09:44] <BurningLlama777> Raptodons are volcels. We're doomed
[2:09:51] <%AncelDeLambert> pretty sure they're purchaseable at this point
[2:09:54] <Seraphile> I've mainly found corrosive in auntie cleo vending machines
[2:10:03] <@lewdskeletor13> What quest is Pat on right now?
[2:10:08] <%Ner234> YOu sleep?
[2:10:10] <BurningLlama777> Thanks Shodan
[2:10:11] <Monkeyweed21> mod another pistol for plasma for Ellie
[2:10:18] <%dalmek> @lewdskeletor13 Roseway's research stuff
[2:10:19] <%rumtumtugnutz> They might be pricey, but if you can find one in a machine it's worth the investment
[2:10:20] <+blitzrush1200> I told you 24/7
[2:10:27] <%nicos143> So she's sentient? Otherwise computers don't snore
[2:10:30] <%honeyman18> Good mods are like 3000
[2:10:37] <+MisterRockett> Give a partner the Shrink Ray!
[2:10:39] <fruit_pie_the_magician> I made two crazy modded heavy machine guns, one electric and one corrosive, and gave one to each of my companions. DPS on them was like 1400 each
[2:10:45] <Sokumotanaka> It's called the unreliable for a reason
[2:11:01] <Seraphile> -20% vendors perk + having a faction like you can make 8k mods go down to 3-4k
[2:11:02] <%v1Ables> crit damage is best
[2:11:02] <%TheTakkster> For your silenced shotgun needs
[2:11:06] <fruit_pie_the_magician> Literally just strolled around and they slaughtered everything in about a second each
[2:11:14] <+FierceDeityGabe> That's a lot of pistols
[2:11:20] <%AncelDeLambert> has anyone modded Nray in yet? Is it worth it?
[2:11:26] <+MisterRockett> Don't joke about silenced shotgun they're dope as hell.
[2:11:28] <%dekkitout> Big number prevails yet again
[2:11:33] <%honeyman18> like 70% discount for my character with almost everyone
[2:11:39] <Seraphile> n-ray is worth it on heavy guns
[2:11:39] <%rumtumtugnutz> @fruit_pie_the_magician I have a heavy machine gun right now modified for shock and it does about 3800 DPS.
[2:11:48] <$arcielardor> when you get a chance put an n-ray mod on a flamethrower or a plasma caster you will not regret it
[2:11:49] <BurningLlama777> o/` spread down, range up, that's the way I shootem-up o/`
[2:11:53] <+RAAAAAINMAKER> put all your guns in storage and sell at groundbreaker where you have high rep
[2:11:53] <mrhooppaw> gyro also comes with an auto aim feature
[2:12:04] <%honeyman18> A-Day just looks cool, half damage means it goes on big damage only.
[2:12:09] <fruit_pie_the_magician> I should also mention that I never leveled my gun skill
[2:12:10] <%depressed_skeleton> zzzzzzzzzzzZap
[2:12:15] <%honeyman18> N-Ray damn it
[2:12:17] <mrhooppaw> it kinda locks to targets
[2:12:18] <%AncelDeLambert> okay, I was wondering if I should bother nray-ing my sniper rifle, definitely not then
[2:12:29] <+FierceDeityGabe> What weapons are good against armor, I do piss damage
[2:12:30] <Kisiel250> will n-ray melee weapons hurt you as well?
[2:12:32] <Seraphile> N-ray can also backfire
[2:12:45] <%rumtumtugnutz> @Fierce Corrosive is best against armor.
[2:12:47] <Seraphile> n-ray debuff on enemies hurts you if they close the distance
[2:12:50] <%honeyman18> Well if does direct damage and aoe poison, so it's close to usefull
[2:12:50] <%TheTakkster> Why make a sniper rifle N-ray when your goal is to kill in one-2 shots anyway
[2:13:04] <%rumtumtugnutz> N-Ray bypasses armor, but is only good on biological targets
[2:13:10] <%AncelDeLambert> nray bypasses all armor
[2:13:10] <misterspotswood> @AngriestPat hey pat, what CPU and GPU are you using? this is running smooth while mine runs like buttpoop
[2:13:14] <%TheTakkster> Better to spray a group of enemies with nray bullets
[2:13:23] <%TheTakkster> So they all nuke each other
[2:13:43] <+MisterRockett> Shrink Ray!
[2:13:46] <%honeyman18> What does N-Ray flamethrower look like, I know some guns change their effect with elements.
[2:14:00] <%TheTakkster> Purple glames
[2:14:03] <%TheTakkster> flames
[2:14:08] <%v1Ables> @AngriestPat if you respec to have 100 science you can mod everything at -90% cost and then respec back. saving you a LOT of money
[2:14:11] <+RAAAAAINMAKER> store your guns

[2:14:21] <%honeyman18> Huh, Acid turned to green goop spray.
[2:14:21] <%WalksWithFate> But now it doesn't fit her holster
[2:14:27] <%AncelDeLambert> I have to say, I'm not very pleased with the weapon variety I've come across
[2:14:29] <%AncelDeLambert> seems limited
[2:14:32] <Monkeyweed21> put a bigger maggazine on your sniper
[2:14:42] <Lochskye> !setup
[2:14:48] <%rumtumtugnutz> Corrosive is the best element because it kills things super fast with little downside.
[2:14:50] <sirrice77> @AncelDeLambert it is unfortunately
[2:14:55] <%AncelDeLambert> tinkering just isn't satisfying
[2:15:05] <%TheTakkster> I like shock snipers so i can one shot scrap mechanicals
[2:15:14] <42nfl19> is there no way for sam to be in the moon gang? not even a moon face logo?
[2:15:14] <%dekkitout> Bigger mags for bigger lads?
[2:15:24] <%TheTakkster> I don't like tinkering
[2:15:24] <%AncelDeLambert> I'd much rather FIND a more poverful gun than make one, it's such an investment that fooling around is disinsentivised
[2:15:26] <%WalksWithFate> Six is four shots more than you need tbh
[2:15:33] <sirrice77> @42nfl19 the moon is in his heart/core processor
[2:15:43] <BurningLlama777> Hey look truffula trees.
[2:15:48] <fruit_pie_the_magician> Isn't SAM an official spacers choice bot?
[2:15:48] <%Bobbledygook> he's a moon man in his soul
[2:15:52] <+CanonHusbando> does sam have any incidental dialogue?
[2:15:53] <+RAAAAAINMAKER> Pat's doing fine, he's one shoting most things''
[2:15:58] <%Jack_of_No_Trades> look out\
[2:16:04] <%rumtumtugnutz> I'm disappointed that I can't mod the fancy top hat I found so it has more armor.
[2:16:11] <%TheTakkster> @AngriestPat There's a chef hat you can buy that states it's specifically for automechanicals. I was livid that you can't put it on SAM
[2:16:12] <%AncelDeLambert> hopefully this game gets mods soon, and tinkering cost is the first thing lowered
[2:16:13] <%rumtumtugnutz> Big fucked

[2:16:29] <TheHeroAppears> anti pat mines
[2:16:33] <+MisterRockett> You gotta make em passive so your teamates don't run right into em.
[2:16:38] <%AncelDeLambert> the mines worked when I tried them
[2:16:40] <MasterCosmic> shoot them when there on top
[2:16:52] <%honeyman18> Set their location with down dpad
[2:17:01] <%AncelDeLambert> YEEEEEEYEYEYEY

[2:19:29] <+TOONFOOD> you missed a gun I think
[2:19:31] <CursedNobleman> INB4 Plague rant LUL
[2:19:31] <BurningLlama777> @GarbageNirvana That's only because no games have an "Amish" class. I saw that video of the Amish guy racing the lawnmower.

[2:25:32] <%AncelDeLambert> HIT IT! Dey call me Hotstepper!
[2:25:32] <Parapattern> The only minor criticism I have with this game is the slight lack of gun and enemy variety.
[2:25:39] <%AncelDeLambert> I'm da lyrical gangsta!
[2:25:41] <Kisiel250> The lab guy asked you to not kill them
[2:25:43] <misterspotswood> is SAM just yes man?
[2:26:00] <%AncelDeLambert> SAM is BETTER than Yes Man
[2:26:01] <@lewdskeletor13> @kisiel250 All he has to do is not kill the mother
[2:26:07] <misterspotswood> hell yeah
[2:26:08] <%rumtumtugnutz> Sam is basically EDE from New Vegas but with more robot jizz powers
[2:26:08] <Gruhunchously> @Kisiel250 Didn't he just say not to kill the queen?
[2:26:09] <Seraphile> SAM has too much sass for yes man
[2:26:29] <misterspotswood> yes man X HK makes me happy
[2:26:30] <%RupanSen> and not enough sarcasm to be HK
[2:26:34] <Kisiel250> I dunno, but there is a counter on the quest on how many you killed
[2:26:46] <%jiin6> misread that as seductive
[2:26:57] <@lewdskeletor13> But is it better than nurture?
[2:27:02] <misterspotswood> hk is very seductive
[2:27:07] <%TheTakkster> Sam's voice actor is also Binky Barnes from Arthur. This random factoid brought to you by Spacer's Choice.
[2:27:11] <%depressed_skeleton> seduce me
[2:27:11] <deviljhojho_> what build is pat rocking?
[2:27:11] <Seraphile> theres a room with the queen + raptidons, those are the only ones that get counted
[2:27:17] <%rumtumtugnutz> Seductive canisters make me uncomfortable!
[2:27:33] <misterspotswood> just sitting there all round n shit
[2:27:42] <%RupanSen> @deviljhojho_ INT and CHA
[2:27:42] <+RAAAAAINMAKER> science liar
[2:27:45] <BurningLlama777> Seduce the raptodons to S-Rank the quest.
[2:27:46] <%rumtumtugnutz> Hard, round, and full of gas
[2:27:52] <%jiin6> Auntie Cleo's seductive cannisters...why
[2:28:19] <%MelBrooksKA> @jiin6 Because you love it
[2:28:21] <deviljhojho_> @RupanSen gotta love it
[2:28:21] <misterspotswood> aunt cleo dummy thicc cannisters coming to an outpost near you
[2:29:00] <%depressed_skeleton> apparently not
[2:29:08] <%Ner234> "Huh, what was that noise?"
[2:29:08] <Gruhunchously> I'm reminded of all those times in KOTOR where you open a door to an area you've been through just to see some dude standing ominously waiting for you.
[2:29:09] <%GarbageQueenEllie> Nighty Night mr gaurd man
[2:29:36] <%depressed_skeleton> Not the mama
[2:29:44] <%rumtumtugnutz> third canister is in the raptidon room
[2:30:06] <%GarbageQueenEllie> @Gruhunchously Stealth in KOTOR is like that scene in a new hope when Han tries to go through a door, only to run the other way from a battalion of troopers
[2:30:35] <%Jack_of_No_Trades> that math checks out
[2:30:39] <%rumtumtugnutz> You missed the canister
[2:30:39] <@lewdskeletor13> Damn
[2:30:44] <Monkeyweed21> Gas canister pat

[2:31:08] <Gruhunchously> @GarbageQueenEllie Pretty much.
[2:31:41] <%TheTakkster> As near a si can tell, your companions are completely invisible to enemies while you're in stealth mode
[2:31:44] <Gruhunchously> Pat, 2019
[2:31:47] <%TheTakkster> someone correct me if i'm wrong
[2:31:54] <%GarbageQueenEllie> @Gruhunchously It's a good way to lure them into a minefield, tho
[2:31:59] <%honeyman18> What's the benefit of saving them again? more rep?
[2:32:03] <+DisasterJensen> hello
[2:32:08] <TechDragon_Z> Another room with rapts has the third tank

[2:34:06] <TechDragon_Z> I honestly didn't know there was an extra 4th tank in here.
[2:34:13] <%depressed_skeleton> Sam is trying his best
[2:34:14] <lethallylactic> D:
[2:34:17] <%InugamiTheHound> ed-e>>>> sam

[2:34:41] <%AncelDeLambert> you can have 2
[2:34:44] <%TheTakkster> I still can't believe you can save jameson
[2:34:46] <BurningLlama777> Call Master Miller for wildlife advice
[2:34:47] <%Jack_of_No_Trades> sneak mission
[2:34:47] <%AncelDeLambert> it's KOTOR, essentially
[2:34:48] <Gruhunchously> @GarbageQueenEllie Once, I tried to stealth my way entirely through the Sith Embassy on Manaan to see if I could avoid getting arrested afterwards. Didn't work, there's a cutscene initiated fight right at the front entrance.
[2:34:49] <%TheTakkster> That blew me away
[2:34:49] <Gorgen> Give SAM some green eggs and ham
[2:34:52] <Roz_Lynd> looks right at you "NUTIN UNUZAL HEER!" slapDerp slapDerp
[2:34:56] <+AllenDeadman> maybe there is another of those tanks somewhere else in the facility?
[2:34:57] <%ColonelSioux> @krikitbonez you see that he has two right.....

[2:36:25] <%Tucker0603> your companions are fucking dumb
[2:36:28] <@lewdskeletor13> I got the three canisters outside this room, so there must be 4
[2:36:28] <%pectusumbra> maybe actually send them back to the ship?
[2:36:28] <TechDragon_Z> There's an extra tank but I dunno which two you grabbed.
[2:36:29] <%Jack_of_No_Trades> you gotta do this right! Leave them in this room
[2:36:32] <%honeyman18> dpad them into a room first
[2:36:33] <@commanderclaw> It's almost like you're not a stealth character
[2:36:34] <%Deekman> Deekman subscribed at Tier 1. They've subscribed for 15 months! Given the reviews how's death stranding grabbing you?
[2:36:36] <%Ner234> Change AI settings?
[2:36:37] <%jiin6> don't worry they will follow
[2:36:42] <%BillyMaze> little late in the year for a S P O O K
[2:36:46] <%Yakobro> pretty sure they're invisible until you're in combat
[2:36:47] <BurningLlama777> Can you like, turn off the "teleport to player after x meters" function...?
[2:36:48] <+RAAAAAINMAKER> Change them to defensive
[2:36:52] <Archmortal> Leave them right outside the door and close the door
[2:36:56] <Kisiel250> Do companions alert enemies?
[2:37:05] <%Enz0ned> theres gas near the docks
[2:37:05] <Kisiel250> I don't think they do
[2:37:09] <Roz_Lynd> not according to some
[2:37:13] <%Jack_of_No_Trades> Sneak 100
[2:37:22] <Roz_Lynd> apparently "companions are invisible when in stealth mode"?
[2:37:25] <%CaityCoopScoops> ***
[2:37:26] <%BillyMaze> Spook 100
[2:37:28] <TechDragon_Z> There's an extra tank in another room
[2:37:34] <Roz_Lynd> ¬Ø\_(„ÉÑ)_/¬Ø
[2:37:45] <%dabeaminator> Tell them to return to the ship
[2:37:49] <TechDragon_Z> I dont know which two you grabbed though
[2:37:57] <%ColonelSioux> @Roz_Lynd thats been a thing in every fallout game only you count
[2:37:59] <TechDragon_Z> I didn't even know the rapt room had a tank in ti
[2:38:02] <%Enz0ned> theres also a tank near the docks on the other side of the machine
[2:38:09] <Roz_Lynd> never played a fallout game
[2:38:11] <@lewdskeletor13> There definitely is, I didn‚Äôt have to get that tank in there
[2:38:12] <%AncelDeLambert> oh, hey, it's THE BITCH

[2:38:18] <%AncelDeLambert> SHOOT HER NOW
[2:38:19] <Roz_Lynd> i'm just observing
[2:38:21] <%ColonelSioux> @Roz_Lynd witch leads to hilarious shit like your companion bumping into and walking in circles around enemys in the fallout games
[2:38:21] <@Moobot> Hey, if you guys feel like checking out The Outer Worlds on account of this stream or cause you think I'm cool, go ahead and use this link https://bit.ly/2JmpB3Q to grab it off Greenman Gaming, and I'll get a few bucks kicked back. Thanks!

[2:38:38] <%rumtumtugnutz> NEAT
[2:38:48] <Roz_Lynd> i'm picturing a monkey companion throwing bottles and knives at enemies and they do nothing about it
[2:39:04] <Gruhunchously> @GarbageQueenEllie Funny thing is,,in Manaan you can see the seeds of a lot of things that would later show up in Mass Effect. Diplomatic wranglings, less black and white morality, even the blue and white color scheme. It's like a proto-Citadel,
[2:39:11] <Roz_Lynd> like "what was that noise?? just my imagination"
[2:39:29] <%honeyman18> computer
[2:39:32] <%GarbageQueenEllie> @Gruhunchously Don't forget the pazaak tournament. Mmmm, pazaak
[2:39:32] <%AncelDeLambert> how good is Pat's lie?
[2:39:37] <%dekkitout> That sounds like a "Hey-I-Wanna-Piss-Off-Some-Raptidons-Stick"
[2:39:37] <%rumtumtugnutz> "I think I've been shot. Musta been a trick of the light."
[2:39:41] <@lewdskeletor13> eh imma computah

[2:39:56] <@lewdskeletor13> Kappa
[2:39:58] <%rumtumtugnutz> His lie isn;t that good.
[2:40:16] <%dabeaminator> Fix the formula and sell it to Gladys.
[2:40:17] <Gruhunchously> @GarbageQueenEllie Atton made Pazaak cool.
[2:40:18] <%AncelDeLambert> @AngriestPat recalibrating gives you double musk
[2:40:20] <@commanderclaw> Congrats, raptidon jizz
[2:40:20] <+TOONFOOD> double musk
[2:40:23] <%honeyman18> Jizz Aquired
[2:40:26] <%GarbageNirvana> You get twice as much
[2:40:28] <%pectusumbra> and 5ml is enough to kill a human
[2:40:32] <%rumtumtugnutz> Musk isn;t jizz.
[2:40:35] <BurningLlama777> Mmmmmm. Musky
[2:40:36] <%rumtumtugnutz> Musk is PISS
[2:40:36] <TechDragon_Z> You can give half to the dude and the other half to Gladys
[2:40:39] <%dekkitout> Like Spanish Fly, but for Raptidons
[2:40:41] <%rumtumtugnutz> That's Raptodon Piss

[2:40:44] <%jiin6> 50ml of sex musk
[2:40:45] <%AncelDeLambert> @TechDragon_Z only if your lie is good
[2:40:47] <+RAAAAAINMAKER> This is for the rapt musk quest you haven't actiated
[2:40:47] <%GarbageQueenEllie> @Gruhunchously Now you can download the minigame and play it forever
[2:40:52] <TechDragon_Z> Yeah
[2:40:57] <%honeyman18> Well piss is from the balls so there its Jizz
[2:40:57] <%jiin6> x2

[2:46:17] <%dabeaminator> You really confused this quest by coming in the back door.
[2:46:32] <%depressed_skeleton> Pat was Bald that way.
[2:46:34] <%GarbageQueenEllie> Get a giant hat to warm your noggin
[2:46:34] <DefaultSettiings> Roses are red. Violets are blue. That is their color. That is their hue.

[2:47:54] <%dabeaminator> @lewdskeletor13 These are freedom fighters. They‚Äôre hiding from corporate guards, which Pat would‚Äôve seen if he‚Äôd come through the front door.
[2:47:56] <%honeyman18> You'll be paid for this
[2:47:57] <%rumtumtugnutz> Bits aren;t that hard to come by
[2:47:58] <+Double_Tap_That> Corrosive best damage
[2:47:59] <Parapattern> You get SO much money throughout the game
[2:48:00] <OToole42> do it nerd, why save

[2:56:18] <%rumtumtugnutz> Except for Crane being a corporate stooge
[2:56:24] <%AncelDeLambert> how has Pat managed to skirt around her worst dialogue?
[2:56:28] <%AncelDeLambert> THERE we go!!
[2:56:28] <b_ikki> FUCK THE MAN DUUUDE
[2:56:29] <%InugamiTheHound> Slip out the back before they know you were there

[2:56:34] <%linSP> IM the good guy
[2:56:35] <%AncelDeLambert> FUCK HER SO HAAAAAARD!
[2:56:35] <%Jack_of_No_Trades> via death
[2:56:37] <+RAAAAAINMAKER> You are the real prisoner'
[2:56:37] <%narusao> freedumb isn't free
[2:56:38] <Kisiel250> kill her
[2:56:38] <gekizenbu> we live in a CORPORATE SOCIETY
[2:56:40] <Dementedpenguin> "Me. Me. Meeeeeee."
[2:56:41] <%dekkitout> "Bitch, r u 4 reel?" x2
[2:56:45] <%honeyman18> cunt
[2:56:45] <Gruhunchously> @AncelDeLambert What's here worst dialogue?
[2:56:46] <Ultimatefool> We KILLED THE SCIENTISTS BECAUSE THEY WERE TRAPPED
[2:56:46] <+CanonHusbando> i mean like I agree but EEUGH SHUT UP
[2:56:54] <+Carpe_Deez_Nuts> She's trying so hard manipulate you, and shes fucking butchering it
[2:56:55] <%dekkitout> Phrasing?
[2:56:55] <%GarbageQueenEllie> "I'm SO WOKE, YOU GUYS~"
[2:56:57] <ArtoriasTheTrenchfighter> Augh fucking Anarchists
[2:56:59] <%rumtumtugnutz> I would rather shoot you in the brain.
[2:57:02] <%Jack_of_No_Trades> yes. they pay
[2:57:06] <%narusao> you're a tool for the man
[2:57:06] <%AncelDeLambert> @Gruhunchously she goes on and on about how she's freeing people from corporate enslavement... by murdering them
[2:57:07] <%roundaboutrevengeance> HE PAYS
[2:57:10] <TastySammiches> she's not wrong, but she's definitely an asshole
[2:57:10] <hoenhime344> have you seen the diablo4 announcment trailer?
[2:57:16] <Sokumotanaka> I just got back, are you fucks supporting slavery?
[2:57:17] <%dekkitout> At least Crane pays
[2:57:18] <%AncelDeLambert> she's pretty wrong
[2:57:19] <Gruhunchously> @AncelDeLambert Wow
[2:57:19] <Dementedpenguin> LUL
[2:57:21] <+RAAAAAINMAKER> Worker bees can leave, even drones can fly away, The Queen is their Slave
[2:57:21] <@lewdskeletor13> She pays too
[2:57:23] <Junkles> shitty scientist or actual criminal
[2:57:32] <Junkles> pieThink
[2:57:40] <+Carpe_Deez_Nuts> no no it's fine, do what you originally said
[2:57:51] <ArtoriasTheTrenchfighter> Like I hate Corporate as much as anyone, but freeing someone from corporate slavery by fucking them over is some Varsity League mental gymnastics
[2:58:01] <Gruhunchously> Worker bees won't know what to do without a Queen to guide them
[2:58:09] <CursedNobleman> Better dead than red! SwiftRage
[2:58:10] <%AncelDeLambert> she's the worst kind of anarchist fuck-head. She believes she's fighting the good fight and if you get in her way and she shoots you it's your fault.
[2:58:12] <based_versauen> It wasn‚Äôt hard to get me to help. All they had to say was, ‚Äúfuck corporate‚Äù and I‚Äôd be like yeah, we can be friends.
[2:58:14] <+D00msDayDan> @AngriestPat you can still negotiate with her after opening the door
[2:58:18] <TechDragon_Z> The security guards are watching this conversation through cameras by the way. Just a heads up.
[2:58:21] <Monkeyweed21> SIDE WITH OUTLAW OR CORPORATE STOOGE
[2:58:24] <suikudo> fuck that bitch
[2:58:25] <Sokumotanaka> Better dead than red
[2:58:27] <Parapattern> Seems like a pretty good time to haggle when you're stuck in a cage with no one to help you.
[2:58:33] <%dekkitout> "Quid pro quo, Patron."
[2:58:36] <LodiFrostbeard> you can just shoot her, and you should
[2:58:39] <TastySammiches> give me the TOOTHPASTE
[2:58:44] <+Opalance> Better red and dead than a slave!
[2:58:51] <based_versauen> Nah help her, fuck corporate.
[2:58:54] <@lewdskeletor13> You can appease both factions here
[2:58:56] <%GarbageQueenEllie> Take her heart and offer it as a sacrifice
[2:59:10] <TastySammiches> if your science is high enough you can play both sides
[2:59:20] <ShoggothLord> @gruhunchously The Queen doesn't guide anyone. She's just a baby factory. Eusocial insects have no hierarchy--just castes that serve specialized functions.
[2:59:24] <%honeyman18> Talk it out basically
[2:59:24] <LodiFrostbeard> you can piss them both off too
[2:59:32] <b_ikki> you can pretty much every choice appease both factions
[2:59:34] <+walnutcast> fuck that yolo
[2:59:47] <TechDragon_Z> Got good persuade? Talk down both the guards, because they're listening to that convo, and talk her to give you the research
[2:59:49] <theotrainwreck> I love how this game makes it really hard to hate the corporate guys and really hard to like the anti-corporate guys
[3:00:08] <TastySammiches> you mean really EASY to hate the corporate guys, right?
[3:00:12] <thegreenbenis> @AngriestPat Did you break Paiges foot?
[3:00:14] <@lewdskeletor13> @theotrainwreck It‚Äôs VERY VERY easy to hate the corporate guys
[3:00:15] <%dekkitout> Is it really hard to hate anarchists SeriousSloth
[3:00:22] <mrhooppaw> boone?
[3:00:26] <+Opalance> Speaking of evil corporations, the terminator add that played before I saw the stream is literally lying about their pull quotes. They quoted a guy as saying the movie had, "the best action of the franchise" and he just said one scene was a contender for the best sequence.
[3:00:33] <+nekodelic> @theotrainwreck it's easy as hell to hate the corporate dudes
[3:00:36] <suikudo> its easy to hate the corporation itself but the people are just trying to get by
[3:00:47] <Gruhunchously> The corporate guys can hire better PR
[3:00:55] <+nekodelic> @suikudo true
[3:01:00] <%narusao> corporate prison, seems legit
[3:01:04] <TastySammiches> science jail!
[3:01:07] <%AncelDeLambert> yeah, that's why she's so fucked, she's murdering the "trying to get by" people and blaming them for the excesses of the corporation as a whole
[3:01:11] <%CrabSlacks> did the jail door just play a jingle?
[3:01:12] <%honeyman18> For SCIENCE
[3:01:19] <Gruhunchously> Science jail for Science crimes
[3:01:28] <Parapattern> For anyone who refuses to like the corporate boot
[3:01:29] <%AncelDeLambert> and not even necessarily for what the corporation has DONE! For what the IDEA of a corporation is!
[3:01:30] <TastySammiches> arrested for scientist crimes
[3:01:34] <Monkeyweed21> gotta put the unemployed somewhere
[3:01:57] <ArtoriasTheTrenchfighter> Corporate sucks, but arguing that ANYONE with ANY connection to Corporate is the Enemy, or enslaved to them in some way, making them the Enemy, is some Moral High-ground nonsense.
[3:01:58] <%dekkitout> Science! is happening
[3:01:59] <theotrainwreck> I mean like the low rungs on the totem pole, obs the higher-ups are shitheads. I'm saying that a lot of the anti-corporate people are just as flawed
[3:02:03] <ShoggothLord> Even in space, the private prison industry is booming.
[3:02:07] <%AncelDeLambert> remember: it's perfectly possible for EVERYONE in a situation to suck and not be trusted
[3:02:15] <sonicblade38> 100% not shaddy
[3:02:30] <TastySammiches> it's an obsidian game so the safe assumption is that EVERYONE is an asshole
[3:02:33] <+phone5> @AngriestPat one of the scientist in the cells had a book underneath his leg
[3:02:37] <%AncelDeLambert> hard to say how I feel about this security head. He's more moron than asshole
[3:02:44] <Parapattern> What if the slavers are just as bad as the slaves? /s
[3:02:52] <+D00msDayDan> porter bridges
[3:02:54] <%GarbageNirvana> He just let you do all that huh
[3:03:08] <TastySammiches> why do everyones ears glow red in this game
[3:03:20] <%GarbageNirvana> Lighting engine
[3:03:29] <%dekkitout> No escape for those dumb bastards
[3:03:29] <misterspotswood> he has the "damn son where'd you find this"
[3:03:34] <%AncelDeLambert> Love the smell of napalm in the morning
[3:03:36] <ArtoriasTheTrenchfighter> @Parapattern Did you write that backwards? That was confusing.
[3:03:36] <misterspotswood> voice
[3:03:44] <TastySammiches> is it like, faked subsurface lighting?
[3:03:45] <theotrainwreck> @parapattern I'm not saying they're wrong, just that they're often times unlikable shitheads
[3:04:10] <%miguelrod777> he says
[3:04:25] <%AncelDeLambert> hey, at least they aint Spacer Choice mechanicals
[3:04:39] <%AncelDeLambert> oh, hey, which choice did Pat make with the cannery?
[3:04:39] <TastySammiches> this guy's collar looks like it has eyes
[3:04:40] <theotrainwreck> It looks like faux sub surface or something, it would look good if it was toned down just a little
[3:04:41] <fusedforms> I think they tried to make the lighting look more dynamic but they just baked everyone's ears red and it looks pretty weird
[3:05:00] <%TheAsianAvenger96> hey everybody
[3:05:08] <fusedforms> it's the same side every time too

[3:11:47] <Croetec> oh boy racist memes Kappa
[3:11:50] <TastySammiches> didnt moonman get co-opted by racist ancaps
[3:11:53] <$Instagig> Is this a second playthrough?

[3:12:06] <$Instagig> Nice, was wary coming in because i'm also playing it
[3:12:06] <%razielhex> You mean when a bunch of white nationalists tried to c-opt the 1980's McDonald's mascot Mac Tonite! and used MicroSoft Sam PC-generated voice modulation to sub the commercials with right-wing ethnonationalism?
[3:12:13] <$Instagig> but i am past you it looks like, so I will stay
[3:12:20] <TechDragon_Z> Stream died for me, that was weird

[3:12:24] <%ape_hawk> im surprised he hasnt figured out the joke behind the rizzo jingle
[3:12:30] <+CanonHusbando> rate of fire plus corrosive on an MG is like
[3:12:31] <ShoggothLord> @tastysammiches "Rascist ancaps" is redundant. The latter already implies the former.
[3:12:36] <RaimeTT> there are so many QoL things in this game that not a lot of people will notice
[3:12:38] <%Instagig> There we go
[3:12:41] <%Instagig> Instagig subscribed at Tier 1. They've subscribed for 3 months! 
[3:12:42] <%GarbageQueenEllie> @razielhex I...what?
[3:12:48] <%dekkitout> Man, this moon man lore took a dark turn...
[3:12:58] <%razielhex> @GarbageQueenEllie Yeah, it was a thing. Most of them were hosted on the deadsite YTMND
[3:13:01] <TastySammiches> @ShoggothLord that's not true, some of them are just pedos
[3:13:02] <RaimeTT> @ape_hawk what is it?
[3:13:02] <KingSpunf> Dark side of the moon...
[3:13:10] <Gruhunchously> Mysterious as
[3:13:10] <%dekkitout> Indeed
[3:13:12] <%Instagig> SAM is the best
[3:13:24] <Monkeyweed21> Now negotiate
[3:13:28] <CursedNobleman> ellie is bae
[3:13:32] <%GarbageQueenEllie> Takes "Molester Moon" to a whole new level
[3:13:37] <%Instagig> Not gunna lie I didn't even get ellie
[3:13:39] <Gruhunchously> 'Sup bitch
[3:13:39] <%Instagig> I somehow missed that
[3:13:45] <%honeyman18> Where do PURPLEBERRIES come from? Haven't found the source in game.
[3:13:46] <%dekkitout> I don't even wanna know about that...
[3:13:51] <ShoggothLord> @tastysammiches The pedos are at least *implicitely* rascist, I think. I mean, even if they aren't that's not much of an improvement.
[3:14:02] <TechDragon_Z> The guards are listening to this convo, remember,
[3:14:09] <suikudo> Cassandra darling listen Pat IS a video game protagonist of course you cant trust him
[3:14:22] <%honeyman18> convince her to go peacefully
[3:14:23] <Monkeyweed21> YOURE NOT FAILING A QUEST PAT
[3:14:24] <+SatsumaVA> Say you'll help then betray her xD
[3:14:25] <+D00msDayDan> @AngriestPat you can release her and then negotiate to keep the data or whatever
[3:14:26] <ItsAGundamu> Pat you can get it after
[3:14:27] <TechDragon_Z> Persuade the guards after talking to her
[3:14:27] <%linSP> i sorta bugged this quest out by helping her and then taking the stuff back
[3:14:30] <%Jack_of_No_Trades> Maybe if the guards... couldn't?
[3:14:32] <%razielhex> Purpleberries is a futurama reference I think @honeyman18
[3:14:33] <%Instagig> Also, this game is goddamn fantastic
[3:14:38] <sirrice77> @AngriestPat keep doing that, it doesnt screw you
[3:14:38] <+AllenDeadman> you can talk to her then persuade the guard
[3:14:40] <TechDragon_Z> Then make her give you the research
[3:14:55] <%honeyman18> All the other food gets shown where it comes from but that so far.
[3:15:03] <sirrice77> @AngriestPat yeah talk to her, get the research then persuade the guards to let her leave
[3:15:07] <+A123yourdead> Kill everyone on this planet, it was lit.
[3:15:08] <%dekkitout> "Fuck you- pay me."
[3:15:13] <Gruhunchously> I give you my word as a Spaniard
[3:15:14] <CursedNobleman> on her honor? LUL
[3:15:19] <+AllenDeadman> then you can intimidate the reaserch out of her
[3:15:38] <TechDragon_Z> Intimidate or persuade the research outta her.
[3:15:42] <TastySammiches> her accent keeps changing
[3:15:48] <%razielhex> @dekkitout The Hero of PAYME never dies.
[3:15:53] <Gruhunchously> Reminds me of Zoe in RE7
[3:16:05] <sonicblade38> I would trust the honor of a person with a face scar
[3:16:10] <%ape_hawk> see, when youre preachy about it, youre just being annoying
[3:16:12] <Datsanegg> Does it sounds like shes being fast forwarded
[3:16:15] <%razielhex> Cassandra is a fukken COMRADE
[3:16:34] <Gruhunchously> You can tell because she has red hair
[3:16:42] <globalGinnicide> what a bitch
[3:16:45] <%razielhex> Well, that's because her lastr name is O'
[3:16:47] <%razielhex> Mally

[3:17:01] <RantingRavager> eat the rich
[3:17:02] <Monkeyweed21> talk to the guards
[3:17:04] <TechDragon_Z> Er, maybe guards first.
[3:17:11] <TechDragon_Z> Not sure what happens if you let her out first.
[3:17:15] <%GarbageQueenEllie> oh, oh god... why does the moon man look so cREEPY? Oh no....

[3:19:27] <+JM_FUNK> you didnt lie enough
[3:19:29] <%InugamiTheHound> 1 and 3 for this quest
[3:19:30] <CursedNobleman> VIOLENCE! VIOLENCE! SwiftRage . Yes, persuasion is too low
[3:19:33] <Flickerember> Alter the timelines
[3:19:33] <mrhooppaw> you have to let cass out first
[3:19:33] <TechDragon_Z> She should still be able to slip out the back.
[3:19:34] <%rumtumtugnutz> You're gonna have to murdurlate this guy
[3:19:36] <Garry_Guyface> The guys are covering the front door, just let them out the back
[3:19:36] <DrFacilier> huh
[3:19:37] <@commanderclaw> Drink alcohol and caffeine to boost persuade
[3:19:43] <%GarbageQueenEllie> I'm afraid of what Moon Man would do to me in prison...
[3:19:45] <+D00msDayDan> what about the back door, where the lady that doesn'tw ant to fight is hanging out?
[3:19:46] <%razielhex> Be drunk and high
[3:19:47] <mrhooppaw> then she asks you to convince guards
[3:19:51] <%dekkitout> But pat hates temp buffs...
[3:19:54] <vaderxyz1970> need 60
[3:19:58] <Monkeyweed21> let her out first
[3:19:59] <sirrice77> Let her out first
[3:20:03] <TastySammiches> time to CHUG
[3:20:05] <ItsAGundamu> I think I persuaded that guards out of the building then let her free
[3:20:11] <globalGinnicide> There should be a prompt with that gal where you say you can convince the guards
[3:20:33] <DrFacilier> ruh roh
[3:20:34] <TechDragon_Z> You can change the settings to see all dialogue speech checks even if you don't have the requirements.
[3:20:49] <+TOONFOOD> has he found the empty safe?
[3:20:55] <TastySammiches> why does her accent keep changing
[3:20:59] <+AllenDeadman> I think you messed up the dialogue line
[3:21:14] <%dekkitout> Alot of characters seem to have fluctuating accents
[3:21:16] <%ColonelSioux> cassandra cute i like that lip scar Kreygasm
[3:21:21] <suikudo> this seems a touch complicated
[3:21:22] <Garry_Guyface> Keep going through the faucility, there's a back door
[3:21:24] <Monkeyweed21> Take the research
[3:21:24] <sirrice77> Hmm i don't know whats wrong, we arent lying to you
[3:21:27] <%razielhex> capitalist dog.
[3:21:41] <%dekkitout> "PAY. ME."
[3:21:41] <ItsAGundamu> You can get both outcomes in one, i've done it just can't remember off the top of my head
[3:21:42] <%GarbageQueenEllie> Smack her boob a little, then she'll give you the research
[3:21:45] <TechDragon_Z> Turn over research
[3:21:50] <Gruhunchously> Kinky
[3:21:51] <@commanderclaw> Research is worth money to Gladys
[3:21:53] <$Garthunox> Playing both sides is always tricky
[3:21:59] <%razielhex> Finally, a chance to use my degree in titclapping
[3:22:00] <@lewdskeletor13> Ask for the research
[3:22:02] <%dabeaminator> Live with the consequences
[3:22:04] <suikudo> ask yourself if its worth it
[3:22:08] <Monkeyweed21> FUCK THE CORP PAY ME
[3:22:08] <%linSP> theres technically like three sides
[3:22:16] <BunnyEmperor> monkaS
[3:22:16] <ItsAGundamu> SAM
[3:22:19] <TechDragon_Z> Pfffft
[3:22:19] <%Ner234> LUL
[3:22:19] <+AllenDeadman> I think you had to tell her you had to work for the cientist, or blow your cover, then you can convince her you can talk to the guards
[3:22:21] <%linSP> BYE SAM
[3:22:21] <TastySammiches> bye SAM!
[3:22:22] <%razielhex> MicroSoft SAM
[3:22:24] <%dekkitout> Very good, SAM
[3:22:25] <SilverFaustX> lol
[3:22:27] <%InugamiTheHound> LUL
[3:22:28] <TechDragon_Z> Pat that sends SAM back to the ship.
[3:22:30] <%razielhex> Dog Dick
[3:22:30] <TechDragon_Z> Pat watchout
[3:23:02] <Monkeyweed21> FUCK THE CORP GET PAYED
[3:23:10] <%Ner234> This timeline hopping is starting to get confusing LUL
[3:23:29] <Marco_Apollo> END HER
[3:23:29] <SilverFaustX> lmao
[3:23:30] <%dekkitout> Maybe Plague can make sense of all these timelines
[3:23:30] <@Moobot> Hey, if you guys feel like checking out The Outer Worlds on account of this stream or cause you think I'm cool, go ahead and use this link https://bit.ly/2JmpB3Q to grab it off Greenman Gaming, and I'll get a few bucks kicked back. Thanks!
[3:23:31] <%razielhex> You missed
[3:23:32] <%CrabSlacks> I hate the way this lady talks, it's like she's gonna say "we're not so different, you and I." at any seconed
[3:23:36] <%linSP> she got you lol
[3:23:39] <%GarbageQueenEllie> looool
[3:23:42] <TechDragon_Z> She take bullets to the skull pretty well. Who knew.
[3:23:42] <Gruhunchously> This is some Bioshock Infinite tier stuff
[3:23:44] <BunnyEmperor> She got a thick skull ehh
[3:23:51] <misterspotswood> @CrabSlacks lel yeah
[3:23:56] <Gruhunchously> Really thick skull
[3:23:56] <+AllenDeadman> yeah, I think she has to know you work for the cientist for you to convice her that you can talk to the guards, but it's too late for that at this point
[3:24:04] <%dabeaminator> Make your choice
[3:24:19] <%linSP> does he have dialogues hidden if a stat is too low
[3:24:22] <Gruhunchously> No place for fencesitters here
[3:24:25] <%linSP> usually i stack until i have enough
[3:24:29] <CursedNobleman> my preference is RE4 style, shot in the leg, clip in the fae LUL
[3:24:33] <Monkeyweed21> EAT THE RICH PAT
[3:24:40] <Gruhunchously> EAT THEIR FLESH
[3:24:43] <@lewdskeletor13> You can let her out the back way, she doesn‚Äôt have to encounter the guards. You can haggle the research from her
[3:24:52] <+AllenDeadman> so, will you help her or blow her brains out?
[3:24:56] <maddman12345> Still has the spacer choice helmet
[3:25:03] <TechDragon_Z> Let her out, then take the research. With words. Or bullets.
[3:25:13] <%dekkitout> Don't enable the anarchists, at least the commie-beatnicks had rules
[3:25:29] <TechDragon_Z> Pat there's a bomb there.
[3:25:33] <TechDragon_Z> Pat watchout.
[3:25:35] <Monkeyweed21> free her, take the research, THEN talk to them
[3:25:43] <%GarbageQueenEllie> Pat watch out there's a bomb!
[3:25:51] <CursedNobleman> disregard corporate criticism, buy from Amazon LUL
[3:25:57] <Gruhunchously> A bomb!
[3:25:58] <its_xman> you can talk to her and say your help then tell the guards the back off
[3:26:05] <%dekkitout> Pat, you sold the Varmint Rifle
[3:26:16] <%rumtumtugnutz> EDE has the Varmint Rifle
[3:26:29] <%ape_hawk> you mean DRUGS
[3:26:35] <TechDragon_Z> If you want you can set it to see all dialogue skill checks at all times.
[3:26:39] <%MaddyCaddy> Respec your character for 500 bits
[3:26:44] <CursedNobleman> i think i prefer new vegas to outer worlds, its probably just the music LUL
[3:26:44] <%ape_hawk> pat, drugs are only temp buffs if you stop taking them
[3:26:47] <%linSP> mmm beer
[3:26:48] <%rumtumtugnutz> DRUGS DRUGS DRUGS DRUGS DRUGS EVERYBODY
[3:26:59] <%dekkitout> "Don't do temp buffs, kids"
[3:27:02] <%rumtumtugnutz> I wish this game had better music
[3:27:02] <TastySammiches> shots shots shots shot-shot-shots ü•É
[3:27:03] <%GarbageQueenEllie> everybody gets hiiiIiIIIIIIigh
[3:27:03] <Paragon_Sheep> Pat, just finished this yesterday, and I gotta say... woof, what a fucking fantastic game.
[3:27:06] <%rumtumtugnutz> Or music.
[3:27:14] <+AllenDeadman> I think the line goes you lie to her > you blow up your cover and let her know you work for the cientist > you convince her you can talk to the guards > then you convince the guards to walk away
[3:27:20] <Archmortal> For someone that burned down Edgewater seems like you're overthinking this
[3:27:22] <%rumtumtugnutz> Just gun all the Vodka
[3:27:24] <Monkeyweed21> now save
[3:27:25] <+AllenDeadman> but at this point you lied too well
[3:27:26] <CursedNobleman> the space ambience is cool, but its not jingle jangle or blue moon
[3:27:29] <%CrabSlacks> doesn't felix help with persuasion?
[3:27:30] <+CanonHusbando> mind attributes also improve some stats
[3:27:33] <@commanderclaw> @AngriestPat INT also affects persuade, so drinking a caffeine drink will also boost it
[3:27:41] <%Sovspot> Sovspot subscribed with Twitch Prime. They've subscribed for 15 months! 
[3:27:46] <+CanonHusbando> body attributes for intimidation too
[3:27:59] <canolucass> why not kill that b**tch
[3:27:59] <%ape_hawk> *drinks booze* "y'know -hic- you sha totally let dese guys go, hehe"
[3:28:05] <%GarbageQueenEllie> RUUN
[3:28:13] <%thenumber5point5> dont 100% remeber how i did it, think it was some data i found on a console helped me get rid of the gaurds
[3:28:14] <Kisiel250> You can drink booze with an inhaler PogChamp
[3:28:28] <%rumtumtugnutz> Spectrum Vodka doesn;t get you drunk. It's sugar water and rapt urine.
[3:28:37] <+AllenDeadman> you can intimidate the research out her
[3:28:39] <%rumtumtugnutz> You can huff booze
[3:28:44] <%CrabSlacks> uggh she's such a theater kid
[3:28:45] <maddman12345> you can even vape fruits
[3:28:59] <stfn893> IS that clancy brown or discount
[3:29:01] <CursedNobleman> @rumtumtugnutz a glass for every class! LUL the second advert was a trip
[3:29:10] <ItsAGundamu> Don't think your points are high enough
[3:29:11] <%dekkitout> No one dies tonight- ESPECIALLY ME!
[3:29:11] <LodiFrostbeard> should've just killed the bitch
[3:29:12] <%ShineTheDiamond> Oh got the tumor pig....

[3:29:20] <Zaphire_Saucypants> not with your stats as they ar
[3:29:21] <its_xman> I think you need to have her still in the chage
[3:29:21] <Kisiel250> Take the research from her, then talk to the guy
[3:29:24] <fruit_pie_the_magician> There absolutely is
[3:29:24] <+DrunkenDice> lock and load then mewnENOUGH
[3:29:25] <%ColonelSioux> she got the lip scars man
[3:29:27] <%ape_hawk> on one hand, they are corporate shills. on the OTHER hand, shes a preachy communist
[3:29:27] <+TheSaintJohn> FRICK the corpos!
[3:29:30] <Zaphire_Saucypants> Cuz I know I was able to convince them to leave
[3:29:32] <%linSP> yeah try taking the research back
[3:29:37] <Zaphire_Saucypants> and trick her out tof the research
[3:29:46] <%ColonelSioux> aw come on pat
[3:29:46] <bluescreen1988> yea i dont know why the prompts arent showing up

[3:30:18] <TastySammiches> pat you killed a redhead
[3:30:19] <CursedNobleman> SwiftRage Justice for Auntie Cleo! (It's better than nature.)
[3:30:22] <TechDragon_Z> Odd how her reward money isn't on her corpse, it just magically spawns on her.
[3:30:22] <Jrockoni> why not just let her slip out the back?
[3:30:27] <%ape_hawk> now kill the guards too just to make sure
[3:30:28] <%MonsieurHedge> wait what was her deal i dipped out for a while
[3:30:40] <Zaphire_Saucypants> you can even convince Gladys that it's rocket fuel.
[3:30:41] <%MonsieurHedge> like whats the Big Moral Choice here
[3:30:45] <Ion_Laser> @reddpop_ Well he needed to give a sacrifice to the Mustard Queen LUL
[3:30:48] <+DrunkenDice> EZ Clap
[3:30:48] <%AncelDeLambert> @MonsieurHedge basically everything wrong with anarchic communist extremism
[3:30:50] <%CrabSlacks> kill the guards, they're witnesses
[3:30:52] <%rumtumtugnutz> MORAL RELATIVISM
[3:30:53] <Zaphire_Saucypants> so get a better payout
[3:31:00] <TastySammiches> kill the guards üòà
[3:31:06] <%Agami23> @AngriestPat they've already announced overwatch 2 funk pops
[3:31:07] <@lewdskeletor13> Antons a prick
[3:31:16] <%dabeaminator> BRAND TRAITOR
[3:31:21] <DrFacilier> Agreed. If you cant appease both sides then kill both sides
[3:31:26] <+DrunkenDice> sounds like a trap
[3:31:38] <%AncelDeLambert> now lie, Pat, LIEEEEEEE
[3:31:40] <%rumtumtugnutz> @Agami23 Let me know when they announce Overwatch 2 Tubbz. Or Bad Nanners.
[3:31:47] <Gruhunchously> Well that's the last time I'm buying Auntie Cleo.
[3:31:49] <%rumtumtugnutz> *those are both things.
[3:31:53] <%thenumber5point5> give to anton.. for late game reason
[3:31:55] <%linSP> whaaaat research
[3:31:58] <%AncelDeLambert> BIG LIE
[3:32:03] <%ape_hawk> you can ALWAYS lie
[3:32:05] <bear_breaker20> lying is power
[3:32:05] <%AncelDeLambert> hey to you too, chief
[3:32:05] <fruit_pie_the_magician> I let her go, took the research and made them not care
[3:32:08] <Gruhunchously> LIES
[3:32:09] <@commanderclaw> @AngriestPat Giving the guy the gun research results in a unique handgun
[3:32:17] <%AncelDeLambert> it's low level lie, too

[3:32:51] <%linSP> talk to the guy with horny drugs
[3:32:51] <@lewdskeletor13> oh nooo I can‚Äôt starve the masses to get to a fancy city, boo hoo
[3:32:52] <%CrabSlacks> I hope he kills himself
[3:32:54] <+D00msDayDan> keeping the data away from anton is definitely the right choice because auntie cleo isn't gonna do shit about the blindness thing
[3:32:55] <%AncelDeLambert> rapts dindu nuffin
[3:33:04] <+TOONFOOD> at least you have jameson, toothpaste scientist
[3:33:22] <%rumtumtugnutz> did you find the gun schematics?
[3:33:25] <ItsAGundamu> ?
[3:33:44] <%dabeaminator> The pistol sucks
[3:33:55] <%AncelDeLambert> yeah, it's sad, the pistol aint that great
[3:33:58] <%rumtumtugnutz> NOPE
[3:34:01] <+RAAAAAINMAKER> the second one he gives you doesn't
[3:34:03] <%AncelDeLambert> it should have been a science weapon
[3:34:05] <%TheAsianAvenger96> You could have sold that to Gladys too
[3:34:09] <%linSP> YEAH capitalism
[3:34:15] <%AncelDeLambert> nope
[3:34:17] <%dekkitout> Fuck yo, PAY ME!
[3:34:19] <%v1Ables> its a corrosive weapon
[3:34:20] <ItsAGundamu> Pistol sucks
[3:34:24] <its_xman> It is a rare and only weapon
[3:34:27] <Monkeyweed21> its a shit weapon
[3:34:29] <NeroInfinite> IT's not sci.
[3:34:29] <%linSP> it was a rare weapon not a science
[3:34:30] <%v1Ables> its a high crit corrosive pistole
[3:34:31] <Zaphire_Saucypants> it ricochets bullets
[3:34:32] <Gruhunchously> Science or bust
[3:34:32] <+RAAAAAINMAKER> its a unique gun
[3:34:32] <%jiin6> oboeshCorrosion corrosion
[3:34:36] <fruit_pie_the_magician> @AngriestPat he gives you a gun now, then a different gun later
[3:34:38] <%GarbageNirvana> It's still a really good gun
[3:34:40] <+bordje> its a unique but it falls off pretty soon
[3:34:42] <%GarbageQueenEllie> sell sell sell
[3:34:42] <ItsAGundamu> Science weapons are just not great
[3:34:44] <%AncelDeLambert> unique don't mean shit in this game, sadly
[3:34:44] <@commanderclaw> Just a unique corrosion gun
[3:34:45] <Monkeyweed21> go to aphrodesiac gun
[3:34:46] <%depressed_skeleton> i cry now
[3:34:51] <%AncelDeLambert> What? Who said that?
[3:34:53] <%GarbageNirvana> And a lot of the science weapons ain't worth sadly
[3:34:56] <+RAAAAAINMAKER> 2nd gun is corrosive
[3:34:58] <zamzoph> So sad? Is this Goblins? Kappa
[3:34:59] <%v1Ables> DONT take the second gun until you hit late game
[3:35:00] <%MonsieurHedge> i mean whats the alternative
[3:35:02] <+AllenDeadman> it gives you ONE gun
[3:35:04] <+walnutcast> neither are good, make a decision you pusspuss
[3:35:09] <%rumtumtugnutz> But it makes getting to Spectrum Bay more expensive.
[3:35:09] <bluescreen1988> yea science weapons are diussapointing
[3:35:10] <%Instagig> He gives you a gun later in the game
[3:35:11] <%thenumber5point5> neither gun is science
[3:35:14] <%AncelDeLambert> that's the only real problem with this game, the shooty part isn't that deep and it shows
[3:35:16] <%rumtumtugnutz> WELP
[3:35:26] <%AncelDeLambert> @Instagig reaaaalllyyyyyyy
[3:35:35] <%Instagig> Yeah he calls you

[3:35:42] <%depressed_skeleton> but he doesn't have your number tho
[3:35:46] <BurningLlama777> o/` Musiiiic o/`
[3:35:48] <%Instagig> What difficulty is Pat on
[3:35:50] <%rumtumtugnutz> If you keep the schematics, you get the gun for 100 bits.
[3:35:51] <fruit_pie_the_magician> @AngriestPat He actually does call you
[3:35:54] <%AncelDeLambert> Pat's on normal, I think
[3:35:55] <Zaphire_Saucypants> shoot it
[3:35:55] <NeroInfinite> normal
[3:35:56] <misterspotswood> so whos the worst company in the game?
[3:36:00] <%v1Ables> yep
[3:36:00] <NeroInfinite> andyes
[3:36:01] <ItsAGundamu> yea it sucks
[3:36:03] <%AncelDeLambert> BIG Spacer's Choice
[3:36:05] <%v1Ables> very good midgame gun
[3:36:05] <%Instagig> Normal is very easy from what i've seen
[3:36:06] <Monkeyweed21> MEDIOCRE
[3:36:08] <%AncelDeLambert> SC is the absolute worst
[3:36:08] <%JJCheeker> why do you look like Mr. peanut
[3:36:12] <%rumtumtugnutz> @Mister Auntie Cleo seems pretty bad.
[3:36:13] <fruit_pie_the_magician> @AngriestPat TINKER
[3:36:21] <%ape_hawk> it ricochets
[3:36:22] <NeroInfinite> It's terrible
[3:36:22] <%dekkitout> Of course- the thing named 'Ultimatum' is shit.... fuck that story...
[3:36:24] <+walnutcast> it BOUNCES
[3:36:25] <misterspotswood> @AncelDeLambert seems so
[3:36:27] <%AncelDeLambert> @Instagig it is, I should have gone hardcore
[3:36:31] <%v1Ables> actually shoot fast tho?
[3:36:33] <LodiFrostbeard> you get a better one later
[3:36:34] <%dabeaminator> I warned you it sucks
[3:36:35] <%rumtumtugnutz> Spacer's Choice isn;t that bad, really.
[3:36:38] <%depressed_skeleton> jesus i am happy i sold that
[3:36:39] <misterspotswood> @patriotrenegade
[3:36:39] <+walnutcast> its just a fun gun because the shots bounce on walls n shit @AngriestPat
[3:36:40] <%GarbageQueenEllie> Worse than the Dissapointer?
[3:36:42] <%QueequegTheater> Joke's on you suckers, I had a couple cents in my old Microsoft account so I'm downloading the game for $0.23
[3:36:47] <misterspotswood> @AngriestPat shoot it fast fast fast
[3:36:47] <%Instagig> I'm gunna finish up and start a new harder one soon, because it just feels like it doesn't matter at all what i use

[3:36:56] <%AncelDeLambert> reminder that SC forces you to pay for your own grave
[3:36:59] <%sporeian94> So I beat this game and I'm not gonna spoil it, but I got to a world near the end game and did a sidequest and the sidequest ruined my rep faction so much the entire world became hostile to me and I couldn't finish side missions cause guards just would attack on site, so fair warning Pat
[3:37:16] <Gruhunchously> Cool
[3:37:18] <gamccc> mr. peanut

[3:37:51] <CursedNobleman> she saves you 10k?
[3:37:55] <%Enz0ned> navkey ?

[3:38:00] <@commanderclaw> 1500
[3:38:00] <+walnutcast> @AngriestPat you should just not save scum every choice LUL
[3:38:02] <%JJCheeker> 3.50
[3:38:04] <%dabeaminator> More than him
[3:38:04] <%rumtumtugnutz> You get a big discount on the navkey if you sell her all 3 experiments
[3:38:09] <%sporeian94> You think they'll patch it? Cause it was pretty sucky
[3:38:10] <%linSP> i gave all 3 and didnt get a navkey
[3:38:13] <%QueequegTheater> About tree fiddy
[3:38:17] <Monkeyweed21> hey gave you 100 bits
[3:38:20] <%JJCheeker> tree fiddy
[3:38:21] <fruit_pie_the_magician> More than him, but no two guns
[3:38:32] <+RAAAAAINMAKER> Bothsides give 9K if you push all dialog checks
[3:38:32] <LodiFrostbeard> money is a non issue in this game

[3:39:06] <%QueequegTheater> This is a watered down Fallout game so money has literally no meaning
[3:39:10] <Gorgen> Can you rommance the robot
[3:39:12] <Monkeyweed21> now talk to drug nab
[3:39:25] <+AllenDeadman> now the musk

[3:40:06] <Gorgen> Can i romance the mods then?
[3:40:08] <+Mdub98> @queequegtheater what do you mean watered down dude? this is more fallout than fallout has been in years
[3:40:09] <%Instagig> Pumping tf out of dialog early makes the game so great

[3:40:26] <BurningLlama777> Ha!
[3:40:40] <%dekkitout> NEVER! Try your own supply.
[3:40:43] <%joylent_blue> implying money mattered in fallout LUL
[3:40:58] <+ThunderZebraKing> Did pat just sell boner pills to a scientist?
[3:40:58] <%AncelDeLambert> my god, the mountain of cash I would have in the Bethesda FO games...
[3:41:00] <%windsoc> i did this with parv and felix and they both said "no" LUL
[3:41:01] <%rumtumtugnutz> @misterspotswood No, he's going to try and bang ladies by drinking rapt sex juice
[3:41:03] <%sporeian94> Damn this game makes me miss Mass Effect...
[3:41:11] <TheHeroAppears> MONEY
[3:41:12] <%QueequegTheater> @Mdub98 Yes with all 3 types of ammo and zero meaningful builds because speech covers more than 95% of prompts? sure it is KappaHD
[3:41:17] <%maximemeretrax> I could use some of that musk
[3:41:20] <+RAAAAAINMAKER> You don't need the NavKey if you just walk to Stellar Bay from Casscadia
[3:41:30] <misterspotswood> @rumtumtugnutz rapt sounds eerily close to ANOTHER word
[3:41:44] <%rumtumtugnutz> I think that might be the point in this case.
[3:41:45] <%thenumber5point5> change quest type to sort by location
[3:41:46] <Monkeyweed21> now mod that gun
[3:41:49] <misterspotswood> creepazoid, i can tell with his one eye
[3:41:51] <CursedNobleman> @RAAAAAINMAKER you also have to walk to stellar bay from cascada LUL
[3:41:55] <%Instagig> What rainmaker said
[3:42:04] <%maximemeretrax> @Que
[3:42:07] <%Instagig> You can just walk instead of getting the nav key, because you have to make the walk anyways
[3:42:07] <%depressed_skeleton> Moon Gang!
[3:42:08] <%AncelDeLambert> so I'm not wrong, the nice engineer that was in the building to the east is dead before you get there, right?

[3:42:23] <%dekkitout> Max just got Dhar'd LUL
[3:42:26] <%maximemeretrax> @queequegtheater Just because it‚Äôs not full Fallout 1/2 doesn‚Äôt make Fallout 4 or 3 better
[3:42:42] <%rumtumtugnutz> I think it's funny that even with the mask you could see the light leave Max's eyes.
[3:42:50] <+RAAAAAINMAKER> Listen... save the bits and Fight the Queen's nest
[3:42:53] <Monkeyweed21> mod your weapons?
[3:42:55] <%depressed_skeleton> Did pat get the broken moon hat too?
[3:43:06] <%depressed_skeleton> sweeet
[3:43:11] <%Instagig> lmao you have all moons
[3:43:16] <%AncelDeLambert> hopefully Pat doesn't get the companion bug that I got
[3:43:21] <%QueequegTheater> @maximemeretrax no, it makes them more interesting RPGs. The writing here being better doesn't change that
[3:43:25] <%rumtumtugnutz> OH BOY I went a completely different, kinda corporate shill-y route than the one Pat is on.
[3:43:27] <%InugamiTheHound> where do you get that broken moon hat? I want one
[3:43:28] <PrinceSpacezero> Moon gang
[3:43:33] <LodiFrostbeard> did he just buy ammo?
[3:43:40] <+ThunderZebraKing> what makes the broken hat broken?
[3:43:42] <%AncelDeLambert> @InugamiTheHound it's in the back of the shop, jimmy the door open
[3:43:50] <NeroInfinite> rip ankles
[3:43:57] <42nfl19> @AngriestPat How many more missing comrades to you have? And did you like or dislike that they spoiled how many there were in the menu?

[3:44:04] <%rumtumtugnutz> @ThunderZebraKing It's not broken so much as faulty cause it controls your brain.

[3:47:09] <LodiFrostbeard> that one's pretty good
[3:47:13] <+TOONFOOD> Did you buy the quest items from her?
[3:47:14] <+RAAAAAINMAKER> datapad, buy it
[3:47:14] <@commanderclaw> It's a burst pistol
[3:47:18] <TechDragon_Z> Buy the datapads
[3:47:19] <%AncelDeLambert> Science Weapon stuff
[3:47:22] <TechDragon_Z> Weapon quest
[3:47:23] <%SGrim> @AngriestPat that gun seems good.
[3:47:34] <%AncelDeLambert> that datapad is shit, tho, points to the hammer you already have
[3:47:44] <+RAAAAAINMAKER> The top three things are the only things worth buying
[3:47:54] <TechDragon_Z> Datapads are for science weapons.
[3:47:58] <%thenumber5point5> science weapon clues pat
[3:48:02] <%dabeaminator> Buy both of her quest items
[3:48:02] <NeroInfinite> Yes
[3:48:04] <Monkeyweed21> Burst pistol pat
[3:48:05] <%ShineTheDiamond> Sure.
[3:48:06] <%windsoc> ellie?
[3:48:08] <LodiFrostbeard> ellie? thats what i did
[3:48:10] <+RAAAAAINMAKER> Buy the quest items and the gun
[3:48:10] <+ThunderZebraKing> @AngriestPat Have you seen what it looks like if you mod the damage type of a telescoping staff?
[3:48:17] <%InugamiTheHound> garbage you mean??

[3:49:39] <%TheTakkster> LiS?
[3:49:41] <LodiFrostbeard> cool
[3:49:43] <%Instagig> Apparently you can get it to work like that
[3:49:44] <coldparty> Arrest this evil thief.
[3:49:44] <%QueequegTheater> @dekkitout Also it turns out my old Xbox account still had $0.77 on it so this game and Gears 5 literally cost me less than a quarter

[3:50:00] <%TheTakkster> oh ok
[3:50:04] <allanmiri> Scum that save Pat.
[3:50:05] <%TheAsianAvenger96> you gotta kill em all
[3:50:07] <Monkeyweed21> buy the key pat
[3:50:09] <%thenumber5point5> really fun to let the compainions use the science weapons frees you up for dps whule they put down dots
[3:50:12] <+alphonseisbest> !uptime
[3:50:12] <@Moobot> I've been playing this game for how long? Oh only 3h 50m.
[3:50:12] <+AllenDeadman> PAT
[3:50:13] <+chekmyfresh> Bait her into standing and turning around.
[3:50:15] <+RAAAAAINMAKER> Use the datapad quest
[3:50:18] <+ThunderZebraKing> You can steal from her safe
[3:50:21] <%dekkitout> Exploiting economies is the most capitalist thing you can do, I'm so proud
[3:50:26] <coldparty> 12% more crunch?! I need some of that NOW
[3:50:29] <+ThunderZebraKing> you have to look at the back of it when you're crouched behind it
[3:50:30] <TechDragon_Z> Either get the nav key or land at Cascadia and be ready to fuckin rumble with giant bugs n shit
[3:50:37] <LodiFrostbeard> weapons from the void
[3:50:47] <%InugamiTheHound> do you steal it from moon guy for the moon hat?
[3:50:49] <+RAAAAAINMAKER> Weapons from the Void
[3:51:00] <%QueequegTheater> @AngriestPat How robust is the weapon upgrading compared to FO4's multiple mod categories per gun?
[3:51:07] <%DSD24> It‚Äôs Riszos!
[3:51:13] <NeroInfinite> no
[3:51:20] <canolucass> did u tslk to the other guy in there ?
[3:51:28] <LodiFrostbeard> @QueequegTheater F4 is a little more complex imo
[3:51:47] <%linSP> ask for TWO
[3:51:47] <%InugamiTheHound> @QueequegTheater the modding system feels limited compare to fallout 4(the mod system in that game was very good IMO)
[3:51:53] <canolucass> moustache guy
[3:51:56] <Monkeyweed21> MOON MAN
[3:51:58] <%AncelDeLambert> just shoot him. Shoot him now.

[3:52:13] <+ThunderZebraKing> After regular show ended, pops fell on hard times
[3:52:14] <%AncelDeLambert> AAAAAAAAAAA
[3:52:16] <%QueequegTheater> @InugamiTheHound I'm getting the game for almost free so that's fine as long as it's better than FO3
[3:52:17] <%thenumber5point5> moonman lore on computer near by
[3:52:17] <%GarbageQueenEllie> He sounds so happy
[3:52:18] <allanmiri> Make a choice, Spacer's Choice
[3:52:19] <NeroInfinite> oh martin...
[3:52:24] <%arancet> be brave, martin, be brave for craterface
[3:52:29] <%QueequegTheater> @LodiFrostbeard I gather it's somewhat close then?
[3:52:30] <%AncelDeLambert> @thenumber5point5 Pat read it last time
[3:52:33] <%ape_hawk> martin and parvati are the two npc's we need to protect and hug
[3:52:38] <%jiin6> Martin...you are the moon man
[3:52:39] <%AncelDeLambert> we... we pray for moonman
[3:52:41] <%QueequegTheater> Even if it's not AS good, that's still okay
[3:52:43] <ALazo> What is this feeling of sadness
[3:52:43] <%CrabSlacks> Martin was never seen again
[3:52:52] <zamzoph> Are there any women with long hair in this game?
[3:53:02] <TheHeroAppears> long hair is hard to animate
[3:53:04] <%AncelDeLambert> don't be silly, long hair doesn't exist in space
[3:53:15] <%ape_hawk> no because long hair means physics which means animating which means budget
[3:53:23] <%QueequegTheater> No, the corporations make them pay taxes with the extra hair
[3:53:23] <%InugamiTheHound> @QueequegTheater the game is a lot fun but the main quests is not as good as FO3 and DLC is not really good expect for one(far harbor) but you'll have tons of fun if you love fallout gameplay loop.
[3:53:23] <%GalacticaPhanto> she has amazing facial features like damn
[3:53:25] <%GarbageQueenEllie> TFW no fabulous long hair :(

[3:54:42] <%QueequegTheater> @Slim_Lipid Yeah that's weird. Liquids, sure, but gas can be compressed
[3:54:53] <LodiFrostbeard> @Slim_Lipid how else do you meassure it? weight?
[3:54:55] <+ThunderZebraKing> I like that npc's have unique reactions and in some cases conversations with your companions
[3:54:59] <%AncelDeLambert> it's measured by the volume at standard temp-pressure

[3:55:08] <+AllenDeadman> she looks like she's seen a coup'le of friends too many get stabbed in the back

[3:57:34] <$Timesteel> @misterspotswood 8700k
[3:57:36] <+ThunderZebraKing> @AngriestPat If you put a damage mod on a telescoping staff it does something very unique to the appearance.

[3:58:18] <%DSD24> Monarchs a cool planet
[3:58:28] <fearhurst> @angriestpat consider going to Cascadia Port instead of the Stellar Bay Port if you want to have a cool fight
[3:58:29] <fruit_pie_the_magician> @AngriestPat that weapon literally fucks up peoples faces Josuke style when you hit them
[3:58:35] <arkv01> we need to build all our cars with an onahole from now on

[3:58:50] <+RAAAAAINMAKER> Weapons from the Void just updated, go back on the groundbreaker and pick up the Science Hammer
[3:59:07] <+G_Thunders> Why does he think all the colonists are revolutionaries? They signed on to work for the companies before moving here
[3:59:10] <NeroInfinite> the last companion
[3:59:21] <%Tucker0603> @angriestpat somehow even though Wells seems like he's doing good I don't trust him...

[3:59:27] <NeroInfinite> And possible bug maybe
[3:59:32] <%QueequegTheater> I hope I get to put down peasant revolts for my benevolent corporate overlords in this game
[3:59:33] <%Instagig> Did pat hack the terminal in his lab and read his emails?
[3:59:52] <%Instagig> Mkay
[3:59:53] <%thenumber5point5> he has hammer, he has oth the sci weapons he can have at this point
[3:59:53] <%QueequegTheater> Also I always play a female Caesar's legion Courier
[4:00:15] <mrhooppaw> scylla is small and easy to clear. I'd recommend going there before monarch
[4:00:25] <%depressed_skeleton> Hey Rick
[4:00:28] <+alphonseisbest> @QueequegTheater thats some cursed shit right there
[4:00:29] <@lewdskeletor13> The guy he was talking to in the emails is the Hiram he just mentioned
[4:00:38] <%arancet> @AngriestPat hes in there because the plot requires you to not be able to kill him
[4:00:42] <%dekkitout> "They'll pay ME!?"
[4:00:44] <+G_Thunders> Pretty sure he‚Äôs in there so you don‚Äôt kill him
[4:00:44] <%DSD24> I hope he brings Max along for Monarch
[4:00:52] <%QueequegTheater> @alphonseisbest I like villainy, it arouses me
[4:00:57] <%ape_hawk> hey guys, i wonder who the unkillable npc is in this game?
[4:00:58] <+ultracoolboy7> oof
[4:01:01] <@lewdskeletor13> He‚Äôs in there so you can‚Äôt kill him and destroy the main quest
[4:01:04] <allanmiri> "Morty we gotta save the sleepers Morty.
[4:01:07] <suikudo> House is that you?

[4:01:42] <+ultracoolboy7> do we die>
[4:01:46] <+ultracoolboy7> ?
[4:01:50] <%QueequegTheater> Alright I need to duck out before I get too spoiled
[4:01:53] <%miguelrod777> super guilt
[4:01:58] <+RAAAAAINMAKER> There aren't any children in this game right?
[4:02:00] <+alphonseisbest> @QueequegTheater siding with Caesar is beyond evil tho
[4:02:03] <Jrockoni> ah....he wants an army
[4:02:11] <Ultimatefool> @RAAAAAINMAKER Nope
[4:02:13] <+ultracoolboy7> oh
[4:02:17] <%QueequegTheater> @alphonseisbest exactly. The more evil the bigger the Kreygasm
[4:02:19] <%dekkitout> Uncorrupted, malleable, unbiased minds.... yum~
[4:02:20] <+ultracoolboy7> we are goop
[4:02:42] <+ultracoolboy7> hope for hope nope for nope
[4:02:56] <CursedNobleman> @alphonseisbest Mr. House is best! SwiftRage
[4:03:00] <%InugamiTheHound> what about Hope from final fantasy 13??
[4:03:02] <%QueequegTheater> We were born of the goop, made men by the goop, undone by the goop
[4:03:17] <%QueequegTheater> GoopBorne
[4:03:17] <coldparty> Does this game have any Xenomorph-ish aliens to fight?
[4:03:19] <fearhurst> @angriestpat Scylla is very small and full of grape apes
[4:03:21] <%dekkitout> Fear the old goop
[4:03:29] <„Éü„É•„Ç¶„É¨4242> is cafenoid better than coffee? i kinda want to try some. why can't more things be real?
[4:03:30] <Jrockoni> yeah he totally just wants an army that's got no understanding of the corporations
[4:03:32] <%QueequegTheater> Alright I'm out before spoils
[4:03:35] <+alphonseisbest> @CursedNobleman eh, he's not the worst, but certainly not the best
[4:03:39] <WhitePantherZ> did pat miss the radio free monarch bug?
[4:03:50] <%DSD24> @coldparty There‚Äôs giant mantis‚Äôs to fight
[4:03:58] <+RAAAAAINMAKER> at 100 Science its 90% discount
[4:04:01] <coldparty> Cool.
[4:04:02] <%InugamiTheHound> can you upgrade your teammates weapons and armor?
[4:04:15] <allanmiri> I was playing it earlier and I noticed I botched Felix's quest. I'm so bummed out now.
[4:04:22] <LodiFrostbeard> @InugamiTheHound yup
[4:04:25] <CursedNobleman> @alphonseisbest house has the technology and vision, NCR are just trying to rebuild a failed society, and ceasar is just a moron
[4:04:31] <%TheTakkster> Later
[4:04:32] <%sporeian94> yeah they all do
[4:04:33] <$Timesteel> yes
[4:04:34] <deviljhojho_> ye
[4:04:34] <%sporeian94> it's later
[4:04:35] <%windsoc> not yet
[4:04:44] <RushUnplugged> he'll talk about it after a while
[4:04:45] <deviljhojho_> gotta hang with him
[4:04:49] <@lewdskeletor13> He will later
[4:04:51] <$Timesteel> they all have one except Sam I think
[4:04:51] <dan_g_v> hey chat peoples. what war crimes have we commited tonight?
[4:04:53] <+alphonseisbest> @AngriestPat how long u feeling to go for today? long stream i hope!
[4:04:58] <@lewdskeletor13> Everyone but SAM has a quest
[4:05:09] <%TheTakkster> Sam needs a quest, dammit
[4:05:12] <RushUnplugged> well SAM has a quest before you even get it
[4:05:15] <WhitePantherZ> has he done the monarch quests?
[4:05:25] <+ThunderZebraKing> I wish sam had like a personality chip or something
[4:05:26] <+icekept> mass relay
[4:05:27] <%InugamiTheHound> @LodiFrostbeard okay I need to do that.I need upgrade their weapons(I just started upgrading my weapons)
[4:05:27] <„Éü„É•„Ç¶„É¨4242> SAM has a flamethrower attachment, tho. it's an implied quest.
[4:05:28] <%CrabSlacks> do enemies in this game respawn eventually?
[4:05:31] <%ape_hawk> because SAM is perfect and doesnt need a life-altering revelation
[4:05:38] <Monkeyweed21> @WhitePantherZ he hasnt touch monarch
[4:05:43] <%TheTakkster> @CrabSlacks Yes
[4:06:00] <WhitePantherZ> @Monkeyweed21 has anyone told him about the bug?
[4:06:03] <allanmiri> SAM will clean up the universe or rust trying.
[4:06:16] <%fallen92x> when you tinker your weapons, their levels hit a cap. which is 5 levels above your own level
[4:06:17] <%InugamiTheHound> can you upgrade your teammates weapons even if they have the weapon equipped?
[4:06:30] <Monkeyweed21> @WhitePantherZ i dunno probably
[4:06:46] <deviljhojho_> yeah u can
[4:07:00] <Monkeyweed21> DIET TOOTH PASTE
[4:07:06] <+RAAAAAINMAKER> yes you can upgrade any weapon equiped by you or your companions on the ship
[4:07:19] <allanmiri> I had a good chuckle at the tooth paste quest.
[4:07:27] <%fallen92x> find a terminal
[4:07:30] <+D00msDayDan> gosh damned mechanicals
[4:07:54] <%jiin6> you shut up about sam
[4:08:01] <+RAAAAAINMAKER> Oh these hournals are sad
[4:08:17] <%jiin6> oh thats Frey...
[4:08:19] <+ThunderZebraKing> Hot
[4:08:27] <%Chimeraelite> >.>
[4:08:30] <+RAAAAAINMAKER> Deliah...
[4:08:44] <%CrabSlacks> oh no
[4:08:44] <@Moobot> Hey, if you guys feel like checking out The Outer Worlds on account of this stream or cause you think I'm cool, go ahead and use this link https://bit.ly/2JmpB3Q to grab it off Greenman Gaming, and I'll get a few bucks kicked back. Thanks!
[4:09:00] <%jiin6> i mean you could
[4:09:13] <+alphonseisbest> no shock is meh unless u leveling science
[4:09:29] <%ape_hawk> its a good gun, pat
[4:09:41] <+alphonseisbest> well then
[4:09:45] <%jiin6> shock is good i guess
[4:09:46] <%Chimeraelite> lol
[4:09:48] <%ape_hawk> +30% shock, pat
[4:09:52] <+RAAAAAINMAKER> 30% shock boost
[4:09:52] <RushUnplugged> It's just shotguns that are bad
[4:09:55] <+ThunderZebraKing> Pat is a science boy
[4:09:56] <+TheSaintJohn> read the description pat
[4:09:57] <+alphonseisbest> shock is ok but not great endgameish
[4:10:01] <%jiin6> NERD
[4:10:03] <fearhurst> @angriestpat plamsa long guns and heavy weapons are the best guns in the game
[4:10:11] <%dekkitout> Syenz big, schok iz vry gud ClappyDerp
[4:10:13] <+hmgirlpopuri> I got super confused when I started this game because I had the same haircut as ADA's avatar and was like 'is that me on screen?'
[4:10:17] <%GarbageNirvana> Shock is good for robits
[4:10:20] <+r0gamer940> what a shocking revelation
[4:10:29] <RushUnplugged> elements are good especially with science, you just gotta adapt to the enemy
[4:10:31] <%GarbageNirvana> Has a chance to stun em I think
[4:10:34] <fearhurst> @angriestpat no plasma is better trust me
[4:10:36] <„Éü„É•„Ç¶„É¨4242> ‚ô™you wa SHOCK!‚ô™
[4:10:56] <+ThunderZebraKing> Plasma is better for flesh and blood
[4:11:03] <%dekkitout> "And remember, if the walls whisper, do not listen"
[4:11:12] <dan_g_v> it is the LAW!
[4:11:29] <dan_g_v> or maybe french
[4:11:35] <ShoggothLord> Wait is this gonna be a corporate experiment Serenity thing?
[4:11:38] <+alphonseisbest> idk corrosive is damn good endgame wise tbh
[4:11:53] <%ape_hawk> a fuckin pickaxe
[4:12:13] <fearhurst> @angriestpat charging plasma rifle or a plasma launcher that you will find soon can get you some 2k dmg crits
[4:12:13] <%Marpolo13> :)
[4:12:15] <RushUnplugged> plasma is better on flesh, corrosive strips armour on big enemies, n-ray skips armour but usually has a dmg penalty
[4:12:18] <fruit_pie_the_magician> I just made a suite of super weapons, one of each type
[4:12:26] <„Éü„É•„Ç¶„É¨4242> there's something resistant to corrosive. i forget what.
[4:12:28] <+ThunderZebraKing> If memory serves, corrosive is just a flat boost to all damage, but plasma is a little more damaging to meatboys, but weaker to robuts
[4:12:37] <fearhurst> @angriestpat if corrosive is doing that then I'll shut up about it
[4:12:56] <allanmiri> If it works it works
[4:13:08] <allanmiri> It just works.
[4:13:08] <+alphonseisbest> yup
[4:13:23] <+hmgirlpopuri> Does corrosive change the ammo type?
[4:13:24] <ShoggothLord> Monarch is locked down because of a Serenity reaver type situation, I'm callin' it now.
[4:13:38] <%dekkitout> Corrosive is Occam's razor
[4:13:50] <RushUnplugged> ammo type doesn't change, mods only change the output
[4:13:52] <fruit_pie_the_magician> Plasma absolutely obliterates bare flesh, which is the vast majority of enemies
[4:14:19] <+ThunderZebraKing> If you put an elemental mod on a telescoping staff, the ball at the end becomes a moon man head B)
[4:14:24] <%ape_hawk> SPACE MADNESS
[4:14:33] <Jrockoni> @angriestpat N damage for you heavy machine gun. or LMG.
[4:14:38] <%dekkitout> The Board and Whispers? We tie-ing back into Control?
[4:14:54] <%ape_hawk> look sam, its one of your people
[4:14:58] <+alphonseisbest> twins
[4:14:59] <%ape_hawk> arent you all related?
[4:14:59] <%windsoc> well ONE of them is going to have to change
[4:15:02] <%ape_hawk> ...racist
[4:15:06] <WhitePantherZ> is corrosive not just all round the best?
[4:15:18] <canolucass> laralarara
[4:15:21] <LodiFrostbeard> @WhitePantherZ i thought it was
[4:15:27] <+alphonseisbest> @WhitePantherZ it is
[4:15:28] <+RAAAAAINMAKER> Tinker-Tape-Parade
[4:15:31] <fearhurst> @angriestpat basically got ahead with corrosive but if you find a Joch Plasma Launcher make sure to try it out
[4:15:32] <fruit_pie_the_magician> And corrosive takes care of basically anything resistant to plasma
[4:15:33] <+ThunderZebraKing> N-Ray damage is the best I think
[4:15:33] <%dekkitout> Yeah SCIENCE
[4:15:33] <%jiin6> Corrosion oboeshCorrosion
[4:15:38] <%ape_hawk> take the science damage perk
[4:15:40] <allanmiri> That last science skill is really good.
[4:15:40] <+RAAAAAINMAKER> Time to Tinker everything
[4:15:41] <canolucass> acid
[4:15:47] <%v1Ables> recharge on crit
[4:15:48] <Monkeyweed21> health on kill
[4:16:04] <LodiFrostbeard> @ThunderZebraKing nray is weak agains robits tho
[4:16:17] <fearhurst> I have yet to find a use for n rays
[4:16:21] <+RAAAAAINMAKER> Go over-buff all your weapons and armor
[4:16:28] <osiris1260> SCIENCE!
[4:16:33] <+hmgirlpopuri> @AngriestPat Out of curiosity, have you taken any flaws?
[4:16:36] <%Agami23> @AngriestPat pat i have made so many shitty memes today. can i make one of you too?
[4:16:41] <%linSP> poor crazy man
[4:16:57] <%jiin6> he needed some Shock Therapy
[4:17:04] <fruit_pie_the_magician> @AngriestPat the prismatic hammer is doing like 8k on charge hits for me, which are splash damage of ALL elemental types at once
[4:17:05] <%Tucker0603> poor dude
[4:17:09] <canolucass> got an acid overdose
[4:17:17] <%ape_hawk> look, he stopped himself from killing people, hes a hero in my book
[4:17:28] <%ape_hawk> my book is only half a page, tho
[4:17:30] <+RAAAAAINMAKER> Tinker time
[4:17:35] <Monkeyweed21> Scylla first
[4:17:47] <+alphonseisbest> eh, he took the hard way out
[4:18:01] <%jiin6> you mean easy way
[4:18:15] <canolucass> damn lunatics
[4:18:20] <%dekkitout> Max: "Yes, I'm scared shitless of ADA- don't let her know though...~"
[4:18:21] <BurningLlama777> Ada could absolutely act out of malice I bet.
[4:18:29] <allanmiri> He's worried ADA is gonna go Shodan
[4:18:32] <%jiin6> Felix Does not read, cause he can not
[4:18:41] <%cylish> You can upgrade things to 5 levels higher than yourself
[4:18:41] <BurningLlama777> The Malice Chip was probably 5% less expensive to make at the Chip Factory
[4:18:42] <%Marpolo13> skynet
[4:18:43] <%Shacklebox> you can go 5 levels higher with tinkering
[4:18:46] <canolucass> yeah ftw
[4:18:49] <%dekkitout> Felix can only read a mirror sadly...
[4:18:54] <%windsoc> you can upgrade 5 levels past your current i believe
[4:18:54] <+ThunderZebraKing> You can go up to 5 levels past your level
[4:18:54] <+RAAAAAINMAKER> you can go 5 levels past your own
[4:18:55] <fruit_pie_the_magician> @AngriestPat Yoy can go five levels past where you are
[4:19:09] <%ape_hawk> doesnt the perk only effect science weapons, tho?
[4:19:12] <%linSP> you can find a sniper like that closer to your level coming relatively soon without having to spend 500 bits
[4:19:12] <osiris1260> You can go five levels past
[4:19:20] <%fallen92x> any weapon can be 5 levels higher than you
[4:19:25] <canolucass> is quest a drug ?
[4:19:31] <canolucass> which quest u on
[4:19:37] <%jiin6> you can only go 5 levels forward in time
[4:19:42] <%fallen92x> the weapons on mar
[4:19:51] <%linSP> BIG number
[4:19:54] <%fallen92x> monarch are way stronger
[4:20:01] <+RAAAAAINMAKER> Tinker corrision gun
[4:20:03] <+ThunderZebraKing> Big fat damage
[4:20:04] <%jiin6> More Big Numbers for Compact pat
[4:20:05] <%Piemen99> BIG apatBig NUMBER
[4:20:10] <Monkeyweed21> make the machine gun plasma
[4:20:11] <fearhurst> @angriestpat as soon as you go to monarch you will be finding weapons at your level if not higher
[4:20:13] <%Marpolo13> apatBig
[4:20:30] <osiris1260> Monarch is powerlevel central
[4:20:43] <WhitePantherZ> the devs responses to bugs on the forums are really irritating at this stage
[4:20:52] <%CrabSlacks> how many mantisaurs do you plan on running into?
[4:20:53] <%derap41> !uptime
[4:20:53] <@Moobot> I've been playing this game for how long? Oh only 4h 20m.
[4:21:06] <+hmgirlpopuri> Corrosion seems like a total upgrade for generalist damage compared to physical
[4:21:20] <Monkeyweed21> Plasma machine gun?
[4:21:28] <+xrustiechaimzx> what difficulty is this? normal or hard?
[4:21:28] <fruit_pie_the_magician> @AngriestPat the hammer you gave parvati scales to science, as long as you have enough melee to use charge attacks, it's nuts powerful
[4:21:30] <+TOONFOOD> is there an option in the menu to show dps with stats added or something?
[4:21:34] <canolucass> yeah plasma is the best i think
[4:21:40] <Monkeyweed21> scylla first pat
[4:21:43] <%derap41> what'd I miss?
[4:21:45] <canolucass> but that one is good too
[4:22:11] <Monkeyweed21> you'll have to return twice then

[4:27:45] <%jiin6> the idea of space clowns, really horrifies me
[4:27:51] <+ThunderZebraKing> Not JUNK pat, SALVAGE.
[4:27:56] <canolucass> they put too much gravity in this rock u should be flying anyways
[4:27:57] <%CrabSlacks> a lot of people in the beginning of the game reacted to how you were dressed. It's a little disappointing no one comments on your excellent moon head.
[4:28:06] <%dekkitout> Primal WHAT?
[4:28:09] <allanmiri> Pennywise is basically a space clown.
[4:28:16] <+xrustiechaimzx> @colonelsioux thanks <3 <3

[4:35:38] <%jobbedbone> protip kratom sucks don't bother
[4:35:39] <%jiin6> only 4 tabs?
[4:35:44] <scoopioopidoo> kratom is ASS

[4:35:55] <scoopioopidoo> go buy some pot with that money
[4:35:56] <Flarepulse> how is everyone's Blizzcon experience going tonight
[4:36:13] <scoopioopidoo> yeah he was a retard
[4:36:18] <%Kirby_Sauce> Cheer500 looks like once again i got out for the tail end of a stream. Anyway, hey plague, strident stole my joke.
[4:36:20] <Flarepulse> anyone catch a tear gas grenade with their teeth
[4:36:21] <scoopioopidoo> 4 tabs is all it took to break him
[4:36:28] <%jiin6> Blizzcon is still going
[4:36:43] <osiris1260> Streams not over, he‚Äôs just taking a break
[4:36:46] <%logoth_> Elmo wants to stream

[4:36:57] <TechDragon_Z> Pat watchout.
[4:37:02] <%jobbedbone> elmo wants glucose guardians
[4:37:02] <%jiin6> Elmo want 5 hr hugs
[4:37:03] <Flarepulse> it migrated to his chin
[4:37:04] <%NWR_James> ***.
[4:37:06] <%logoth_> What happened is that he became False Egg pat
[4:37:11] <NeroInfinite> Pat shaved his head to be an egg
[4:37:11] <%dekkitout> Sometimes you just gotta let out a guttural, primal wail
[4:37:14] <Sokumotanaka> I didn't know thruston had a brother
[4:37:16] <vtech325> Oh, understood.
[4:37:23] <%Piemen99> stream over?

[4:38:00] <%AgentOrangeShoes> F L O O F
[4:38:01] <+xrustiechaimzx> @derap41 have you tried dmt, or seen things on people who have?
[4:38:11] <%CrabSlacks> Elmo is an elder god
[4:38:18] <BurningWigEmissary> oh yea I got a rag doll cat that acts like a dog
[4:38:23] <%ape_hawk> new vegas had a stronger theme and scale
[4:38:33] <%derap41> @xrustiechaimzx Nah
[4:38:33] <scoopioopidoo> new vegas is on steam tho
[4:38:39] <scoopioopidoo> so it wins
[4:38:42] <scoopioopidoo> for a year
[4:38:47] <%ape_hawk> it also felt more connected thanks to the open world aspect
[4:38:47] <@Moobot> Hey, if you guys feel like checking out The Outer Worlds on account of this stream or cause you think I'm cool, go ahead and use this link https://bit.ly/2JmpB3Q to grab it off Greenman Gaming, and I'll get a few bucks kicked back. Thanks!
[4:38:48] <+Sogeki_Dan> boo! Why Pat cut his hair? I liked it long
[4:38:55] <%jiin6> still can do it...but not in a big scale
[4:38:55] <+xrustiechaimzx> @derap41 the death of the ego apparently, the ultimate humbling, some people it says it shows you what people all god
[4:39:04] <CursedNobleman> New Vegas has big iron on blue moon. NV:1, OW:0
[4:39:06] <Zinax7> hopefully with microsoft money they could improve this further
[4:39:13] <+xrustiechaimzx> it shows you the truth apparently
[4:39:14] <NeroInfinite> what the shit
[4:39:16] <%CaityCoopScoops> oh NO ablsolutely NOT
[4:39:17] <%jiin6> CORROSION !
[4:39:19] <vtech325> How does this game compare to Fallout 76 then? Is it double superior?
[4:39:21] <NeroInfinite> MEGA SPRAT
[4:39:27] <qsirius> just showed up and damn what a cute monster
[4:39:36] <%derap41> @xrustiechaimzx eh what people see and feel while tripping isn't nesscerally true
[4:39:38] <LodiFrostbeard> @CursedNobleman for real i think not having music really hurt this game, it needs a radio BAD
[4:39:44] <%dekkitout> Royal Space Rat Authority
[4:39:48] <scoopioopidoo> @xrustiechaimzx dont get too hyped lol its just another drug
[4:39:49] <+ctommy0720> hows the game so far
[4:39:50] <%logoth_> Look at elmo
[4:39:53] <NeroInfinite> N ray is kinda garbo
[4:40:00] <NeroInfinite> that
[4:40:02] <allanmiri> Oh shit!
[4:40:02] <@lewdskeletor13> This game really doesn‚Äôt need a radio
[4:40:03] <%ape_hawk> yeah, you suffocate
[4:40:08] <%logoth_> Elmo is slow blinking
[4:40:12] <@commanderclaw> N ray really needs a buff
[4:40:12] <%Marpolo13> hmm
[4:40:16] <Zinax7> i wanted more unique perks, armors, weapons, loot and locations tbh
[4:40:18] <%Bwsdante> Elmo likes the video games
[4:40:21] <+xrustiechaimzx> @scoopioopidoo yeah maybe you're right
[4:40:25] <Zinax7> but budget constraints and all
[4:40:25] <+ctommy0720> elmo is chewing up the scenery
[4:40:28] <RushUnplugged> N-Ray halves damage but skips all armor
[4:40:34] <Monkeyweed21> slash proc
[4:40:37] <%JJCheeker> Elmo is taking over
[4:40:38] <NeroInfinite> IT bypasses armor
[4:40:40] <%linSP> n ray is poison
[4:40:40] <%logoth_> All of the side quests in this game are just bland busy work, but you HAVE to do them; so I dont really like the game so much
[4:40:41] <@commanderclaw> Half damage skips armor and poisons
[4:40:43] <%derap41> Ignores armor and can berzerk enemies
[4:40:44] <NeroInfinite> It's basically slash
[4:40:44] <BlindGato> Attacks their chromosomes
[4:40:46] <RushUnplugged> and it adds a dot
[4:40:49] <%ape_hawk> yeah, its radiation
[4:41:06] <%derap41> ah clever
[4:41:10] <%derap41> firefly
[4:41:18] <%JJCheeker> bow down to your overlord, Elmo
[4:41:23] <+RAAAAAINMAKER> yeah give a companion n-ray weapons
[4:41:24] <Monkeyweed21> go up the ladder
[4:41:26] <%Bwsdante> Bwsdante subscribed with Twitch Prime. They've subscribed for 3 months! Elmo loves the vidja games
[4:41:30] <Glass_Muffin> @AngriestPat How is running SAM and Ellie? Im currently running Ellie and Parvati
[4:41:35] <%Marpolo13> apatElmo
[4:41:48] <+xrustiechaimzx> @derap41 that's true, but what if you've already see it, and don't believe it, what if it finally make you understand
[4:41:55] <%jiin6> Elmo is pleased with Corrosion oboeshCorrosion apatElmo
[4:41:59] <RushUnplugged> I fucking love Ellie being such a tryhard
[4:42:04] <%dekkitout> What the? IS ELLIE A SMASH PLAYER?!
[4:42:22] <+xrustiechaimzx> @derap41 I'm not some mad hippie xD just playing devil's advicet
[4:42:51] <%jobbedbone> I want space to sound like the deku tree music
[4:42:53] <+RAAAAAINMAKER> Ellie is literally "Fuck you Daaad"
[4:42:56] <%jiin6> that level up sounds like a few notes from that Wii u Smash
[4:42:57] <allanmiri> Isn't it great that your followers don't block your path?
[4:43:02] <%TheAsianAvenger96> Did Pat get the christmas light collectable
[4:43:17] <%CrabSlacks> yup
[4:43:25] <%logoth_> Nobody can defeat crouching
[4:43:38] <%logoth_> If you crouch under a pile of coats you cant die
[4:43:39] <+RAAAAAINMAKER> crouching turns you invisible
[4:43:43] <%jiin6> pat is all set for christmas
[4:43:44] <%derap41> @xrustiechaimzx Not sure what you're trying to say there
[4:44:08] <%jobbedbone> lets put pat's brain in a SAM
[4:44:11] <AMaidIndeed> gettting sprayed with acid sure is a way to go D:
[4:44:18] <%JJCheeker> elmo just loves his daddy apatGib
[4:44:20] <%derap41> fyi N-ray flamer is beastly
[4:44:28] <%jiin6> Corrosion CLEANS ALL
[4:44:31] <%logoth_> These enemies are weak to acid. As it turns out people HATE being sprayed with acid
[4:44:48] <+RAAAAAINMAKER> Use Weapons from trhe Void quest marker to get the Weapon here
[4:44:56] <ZE_Count> Just saw the reviews for death stranding I guess its good?
[4:45:05] <%JJCheeker> Shoot them with your xenomorph bullets
[4:45:12] <LodiFrostbeard> their screams of pain as your entire gang sprays them with acid, pretty brutal
[4:45:18] <%Ner234> As it turns out: MOST thing hate being spraye with acid
[4:45:19] <%Instagig> @ZE_Count It seems very interesting, and definitely not for everyone
[4:45:41] <%AncelDeLambert> DO IT

[4:46:49] <ZE_Count> You can find background fluff that tells ya what happened.
[4:46:52] <LodiFrostbeard> that would do it yeah
[4:46:59] <%AgentOrangeShoes> What, no, he's fine, it's fine, no limbs is totally fine
[4:47:01] <%AncelDeLambert> the background fluff is good, but there's not enough of it
[4:47:15] <fruit_pie_the_magician> SPARAMBE
[4:47:16] <AnAnonymousCheerer> Anon1000
[4:47:23] <%derap41> Scope wise this game makes me think of Fallout 1
[4:47:24] <DrFacilier> brush your teeth or fuckin die
[4:47:29] <allanmiri> One of my shotguns literally blinked a dude out of existence. It was funny as hell.
[4:47:39] <„Éü„É•„Ç¶„É¨4242> just a flesh wound.
[4:47:40] <%jiin6> Hygiene is important
[4:47:43] <%AncelDeLambert> @derap41 big dreams, small execution?
[4:48:01] <ZE_Count> shelf
[4:48:02] <%MelBrooksKA> @allanmiri were you able to loot them?
[4:48:02] <%CrabSlacks> max might like that card
[4:48:08] <Monkeyweed21> hammer for cheese wiz
[4:48:09] <NeroInfinite> she was
[4:48:09] <%derap41> Is that pats first mk 2 weapon?
[4:48:09] <allanmiri> Nope.
[4:48:12] <%AncelDeLambert> ASSERT DOMINANCE!
[4:48:17] <NeroInfinite> She was asserting dominace
[4:48:26] <%dekkitout> She'd totally a-pose to assert herself
[4:48:27] <+Schlomogoldbergsteinowitz> pat when did you get so skinny you ginger bastard
[4:48:30] <%jiin6> Ellie was asserting her dominance
[4:48:44] <+xrustiechaimzx> @derap41 I don't know, I've tried drugs an they all do different things, but what if you smoked dmt, and that was the thing that showed you the truth, it showed you how everything works, the universe, feelings, moods, humans, mold, an how we spread just like mold just a bigger scale, explain why we're here, what our purpose is
[4:48:54] <%jiin6> moon gang Dominance
[4:49:03] <%AncelDeLambert> ... wut?
[4:49:06] <Zinax7> you don't even have to be dumb to choose the dumb choices
[4:49:08] <Monkeyweed21> no pat
[4:49:12] <ZE_Count> no pat
[4:49:13] <%AncelDeLambert> ... no
[4:49:17] <%AncelDeLambert> Big number damage big
[4:49:19] <@commanderclaw> You want those passives
[4:49:21] <Mrbaconator> no i went full dumb melee it's really good
[4:49:21] <+xrustiechaimzx> @derap41 what if there's a holy grail
[4:49:23] <%AncelDeLambert> Strength number go up
[4:49:24] <WhitePantherZ> as you level them up you gain more crit
[4:49:28] <fruit_pie_the_magician> I have like 20 melee and im getting something like 10k form the science hammer
[4:49:29] <%derap41> @xrustiechaimzx that's not the truth tho that's the dmt talking
[4:49:31] <%torontototoro> nah. I went for a dumb melee bruiser and did just fine. fewer crits, but great overall damage with enough melee specced
[4:49:31] <%vectorless_peon> i have low int and didnt spec into the abilitys past the point they gave crit
[4:49:31] <%dekkitout> Big Number > Do combo
[4:49:36] <Archmortal> Crit damage is still there, just less.
[4:49:36] <WhitePantherZ> i have 300% crit with long guns rn
[4:49:43] <longfin> nope at just stick with long gun or heavy
[4:49:49] <+zcairstrike> Wouldn't be an Obsidian RPG if intelligence wasn't OP as fuck.
[4:49:53] <Monkeyweed21> you have no base crit
[4:49:54] <ZE_Count> Number goes up when you raise number pat this is simple.
[4:50:00] <+xrustiechaimzx> @derap41 maybe, yeah you're probably right
[4:50:08] <%MelBrooksKA> @dekkitout What if I do combo for big number?
[4:50:20] <%torontototoro> DONT
[4:50:23] <%ape_hawk> YES
[4:50:24] <%ape_hawk> DO IT
[4:50:24] <%torontototoro> SAM triggers it
[4:50:26] <@commanderclaw> DONT
[4:50:27] <%derap41> NONONONNO it counts as SAM
[4:50:28] <Monkeyweed21> DO IT
[4:50:29] <%ape_hawk> DO IT DO IT DO IT
[4:50:30] <%torontototoro> SAM triggers phobia
[4:50:32] <%MaddyCaddy> That flaw is dog shit
[4:50:33] <@commanderclaw> SAM counts
[4:50:34] <%MelBrooksKA> Robo racist
[4:50:35] <longfin> take it
[4:50:35] <%ape_hawk> ITS HILARIOUS
[4:50:41] <%dekkitout> ROBOT HOUSE! apatFist
[4:50:49] <%jobbedbone> just ditch sam
[4:50:49] <Monkeyweed21> YOU GET UNQIQUE DIALOGUE
[4:50:52] <+jjjkopf> imagine being bro robut
[4:50:53] <%GarbageNirvana> If you're playing with companions anyway
[4:50:54] <ZE_Count> hahha if you hate sam I guess it wouldn't matter.
[4:50:59] <RushUnplugged> if you get Robophobia before unlocking SAM, you can't even get him
[4:51:00] <%derap41> Makes SAMN unusable
[4:51:07] <Archmortal> Do a dumb playthrough that takes all the flaws
[4:51:18] <+TONYOO101> you get a unique dialog option with sam whenever you talk to him with it
[4:51:25] <+Neirol> @AngriestPat I know you said that this felt superior to fallout but how would you rate it in terms of dialogue options and combat, do you miss the VATS at all or is it something completely different?
[4:51:32] <ZE_Count> Honestly the whole flaw thing is not worth one perk if it was two maybe.
[4:51:35] <MageSonic> Pog
[4:51:37] <%derap41> btw Pat Mark 2 and Ultra is as good as weapons get
[4:51:37] <%MelBrooksKA> Meet stumbo 3.0, the cripple robo racist
[4:51:38] <ZE_Count> Read computer!
[4:51:39] <%ape_hawk> yup
[4:51:40] <longfin> most phobias are minor deductions from your staff and you get a free point it's always free because you use the perk to kill it to solve your phobia
[4:51:43] <NeroInfinite> Melee is trash
[4:51:48] <allanmiri> The GLitch Stick.
[4:51:48] <fruit_pie_the_magician> @AngriestPat It fucks up faces
[4:51:53] <%torontototoro> Oh it freezes enemies on hits sometimes
[4:51:54] <Mrbaconator> melee is not trash yer nuts @NeroInfinite
[4:51:55] <%ape_hawk> its the facefucker
[4:52:02] <%Finaldragoon> literally a Jaw Breaker
[4:52:05] <NeroInfinite> It is in this game
[4:52:10] <%derap41> Its the worst kind of face dildo
[4:52:11] <Mrbaconator> no it's not
[4:52:15] <Mrbaconator> i 1 and 2 shott everything
[4:52:18] <ZE_Count> Computer to read in science room.
[4:52:20] <fruit_pie_the_magician> @AngriestPat Josuke style
[4:52:25] <ZE_Count> check computer pat
[4:52:29] <NeroInfinite> on what difficulty?
[4:52:33] <Mrbaconator> normal
[4:52:35] <%MelBrooksKA> These fucking moon masks are great
[4:52:38] <NeroInfinite> there ya go
[4:52:40] <%torontototoro> @AngriestPat favourite companion? and why is it Parvati?
[4:52:42] <Mrbaconator> fair enough
[4:52:47] <+RAAAAAINMAKER> Listen, Science Hammer has a Hammerdown Shockwave that is mutli-elemental, it's busted
[4:53:03] <Mrbaconator> that also applies on the sweep power attack
[4:53:09] <Mrbaconator> it does it in the air
[4:53:11] <+xrustiechaimzx> @derap41 do you watch Joe rogan? he's a open weed smoker and has tried a few things, an he says it shows you things, and I know that's just him, but a lot of people say it's a big eye opener, but you're probably right, the sad truth
[4:53:53] <fruit_pie_the_magician> @RAAAAAINMAKER I'm using it right now, bumrushed it on my second playthrough, and it's one shotted everything I've hit with it since like level 4

[5:05:15] <%GarbageNirvana> I've already finished one playthrough so
[5:05:16] <%Bane_Kaikyo> "Somnium Files" literally sounds like a thing that would put people to sleep
[5:05:17] <%sporeian94> doki doki's only good to watch if the player has no idea what it is
[5:05:17] <%dekkitout> It's gonna be a long November, and a fruitful December

[5:10:58] <%Bane_Kaikyo> No Nut November is a S H A M... I NUT WHENER I WANT damnit shit fuck
[5:11:00] <%torontototoro> poor max :(
[5:11:07] <%torontototoro> Felix is.... Felix
[5:11:48] <+xrustiechaimzx> @torontototoro the loading screans can be a bit pants, but look at the bottom line, not too buggy, not openworld but feels pretty close, I'll take the long loading screans if that's what it takes, but if you collect quests an do them all in the area you go to, you can almost lie to yourself and say they're worth it
[5:11:49] <%iamtrlly> I was close to not letting Felix on my ship but i figured why not
[5:11:55] <+D00msDayDan> moon's haunted, haunt it back
[5:12:07] <%ape_hawk> of COURSE it is
[5:12:11] <+Fynale> i mean Path of Exile is online only
[5:12:12] <%derap41> Its going to be shit
[5:12:25] <%ape_hawk> yeah but PoE is free and actually good
[5:12:26] <%derap41> Who even gives a shit about Diablo now adays
[5:12:35] <+Fynale> diablo 4 might be good
[5:12:38] <%Agami23> @AngriestPat its a non-linear story game with online forced and other players constantly dropping in and out. its more of a MMO.
[5:12:38] <+Fynale> we don't know yet
[5:12:42] <%torontototoro> @xrustiechaimzx overall not a big deal, but annoying imo. Especially when you get so many so frequently
[5:12:45] <%iamtrlly> Overwatch 2 is so fucking necessary. Im so glad it exists.
[5:12:52] <%ape_hawk> diablo 4 is a distraction
[5:13:03] <%ape_hawk> same with OW2
[5:13:06] <+Fynale> we knew diablo 4 was a thing since last blizzcon
[5:13:09] <+Fynale> same with overwatch 2
[5:13:19] <%ColonelSioux> i like distraction 4
[5:13:27] <%ColonelSioux> i think its kool
[5:13:35] <Rosy_Joan> whats even the appeal of overwatch 2? the uprising events were just horde mode with no reward
[5:13:45] <+Fynale> it's only the pve stuff
[5:13:53] <+Fynale> overwatch 1 will still get all the pvp updates
[5:13:53] <%miguelrod777> its just dlc
[5:13:53] <Monkeyweed21> BUT GENJI HAS PANTS
[5:14:08] <+Fynale> you want story mode and pve you buy overwatch 2
[5:14:12] <%ColonelSioux> @Monkeyweed21 dont forget his toddlers hoodie LUL
[5:14:13] <SGrim> space capitalism? SPACE?
[5:14:16] <+Fynale> if you want pvp just stay on overwatch 1
[5:14:21] <%iamtrlly> Its Games as a service..... So heres your sequel......
[5:14:37] <%Agami23> @Fynale expecting a story mode and not just some pve missions is abit much.
[5:14:40] <+Fynale> @iamtrlly all your unlocks from overwatch 1 carry over
[5:14:53] <Sokumotanaka> Yeah them trying to bait black people in with that female character, no one's happy they're trying that bs
[5:14:54] <+Fynale> @Agami23 they literally said it's a story mode
[5:14:58] <%jiin6> Space was the Last place uncorrupted by capitalism
[5:15:03] <%iamtrlly> @Fynale SO THEN WHY CANT IT JUST BE AN UPDATE
[5:15:08] <+AhegodKira> ya THATS what makes u real small
[5:15:21] <%Agami23> yeah, blizzard says lots of things.
[5:15:23] <%jiin6> Elmo is bigger than pat
[5:15:23] <%Bane_Kaikyo> apatWink apatWink apatWink apatWink apatWink
[5:15:26] <+Fynale> @iamtrlly cuz the overwatch 1 engine cant' handle pve stuff that well they can't do what they wanted to do with the old engine
[5:15:36] <Flarepulse> I wouldn't call it bait, sojourn's been around for a bit they just couldn't think of a kit for her
[5:15:36] <Rosy_Joan> @fynale what it is and what they say is often different
[5:15:40] <%Marpolo13> STFU ELMO
[5:15:40] <+Shotgundam009> KonCha
[5:15:42] <+xrustiechaimzx> @torontototoro yeah that's true, I didn't really notice it when I started playing, but I game shared and my friend mentioned them and they annoy me now xD but I started my supernova playthrough today and loading screans are more time I'm not getting crushed by a primal or reloading cos pavati died
[5:15:46] <MageSonic> LUL
[5:15:46] <+xrustiechaimzx> night my man
[5:15:48] <+Fynale> @Rosy_Joan they literally showed it off at blizzcon
[5:15:51] <%jiin6> Blizzard is like abusive relationship
[5:15:55] <%CaityCoopScoops> stfu elmo~!
[5:15:55] <+xrustiechaimzx> what the fuck was that
