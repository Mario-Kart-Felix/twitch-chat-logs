[0:12:30] <+CptBritches> And Flava Flav wouldn't admit that HAnnibal actually kicked him
[0:12:33] <%sleepy_coffee> The scariest was the bears
[0:12:36] <bettysharkface> Eric Andre is what is hell/limbo for a comedy host late night talkshow.
[0:12:39] <%SirGO0SE> tyler LOVED it
[0:12:39] <%sporeian94> It was CGI, Flav denied the shit out of it

[1:01:08] <sonofthedeepsouth> ZEON WAS RIGHT
[1:01:09] <+HouseofNonsense> I haven't touched this since the very first demo, so I'm glad it controls better

[1:01:14] <+darkdopple> Oh it red, must be 3 times faster

[1:01:19] <%RealThiele> this game in beta had bad performance issues
[1:01:21] <%SvenHolgersson> @joey_jo_jo_juniorshabadoo We'd be lucky for Guts to face one of Griffith's minions in our lifetime
[1:01:22] <Marpolo13> that would be the gravity weighing you down
[1:01:28] <Asblom> yoink
[1:01:32] <%SvenHolgersson> NOICE
[1:01:33] <%Calek> I watched someone play the demo long time ago, and I think it looks much faster
[1:01:33] <+Aeriqui> this was the game that was gonna get me to buy a switch now that its on pc i don't need a switch
[1:01:37] <%Tearonex> @PatStaresAt Did you ever play the demo when it came out?
[1:01:38] <%D3rrtyD4n> oof
[1:01:38] <%srkAres> female toe zone
[1:01:41] <SleepyMaribo> femto is your power source
[1:01:41] <jcflyguy> A zone with femto, duh
[1:01:43] <bart_bagot> Heck yeah
[1:01:44] <+tweedler92> Refuses lasers and shit
[1:01:45] <%sleepy_coffee> Use da boost! Do a barrel roll!
[1:01:45] <+2DSuperiority> go in there for FEMTOs
[1:01:46] <+loukemia83> Fly into the FEM TO ZONE
[1:01:46] <1matheuw> zone of anime bulshit
[1:01:48] <%SundanceShot> femto is your magic bullshit gauge
[1:01:48] <%TheSniperJoe> Femto is the resource you build up to go into Trans Am Mode.
[1:01:48] <%vaporousTippler> I played for 3 hours. I don't know what the fuck Femto is.
[1:01:48] <%worldbrand> we'll tell you when you're older
[1:01:49] <%spiritofmojave> A zone of mercing
[1:01:52] <FennecZephyr> @PatStaresAt It's like a Minovski Particle
[1:01:52] <%RealThiele> Paige foot area
[1:01:52] <+Jajanken4> this looks fantastic
[1:01:53] <+Thorn14> faster Ibet
[1:01:53] <%Jack_of_No_Trades> area with femto
[1:01:53] <%SvenHolgersson> Female Take over

[1:01:59] <prophetdisharmonious> Drop the shield chat
[1:02:01] <Jermatoo> Your shield can get destroyed
[1:02:02] <WanderingSwordsman> @patstaresat think of femto as your mp gauge
[1:02:03] <doggieo> DROP YOUR SHIELD
[1:02:03] <%SundanceShot> vimto zone
[1:02:04] <%joey_jo_jo_juniorshabadoo> Nah, Guts will skullfuck Griffith, just you wait
[1:02:06] <%TheSniperJoe> Shield blocks on the side as well as on the back.
[1:02:07] <Apollo1818> Femto is the stuff you use to buff yourself
[1:02:07] <Dova573> Did Griffith drop the moon on the earth
[1:02:08] <%kyh9> you have buff modes on up-down buttons that consume femto
[1:02:09] <+HouseofNonsense> Everyone always asks "what is a Femto Zone", but nobody asks, "How IS the Femto Zone"
[1:02:13] <%ScreamLord> Lost Planet 3 tried to be Dead Space while Dead Space 3 tried to be Lost Planet. LP3 was actually kinda ok tho
[1:02:13] <%GarbageNirvana> The zone in which your best friend has a moral event horizon
[1:02:13] <%Punchasaur> Rape city battle royale
[1:02:14] <333agus333> Don't you mean KOJIMA PARTICLES?
[1:02:15] <%cureneckbeard> Why would you drop your shield?
[1:02:15] <%BionoidLCR> @joey_jo_jo_juniorshabadoo thats hot
[1:02:20] <%Mr_Strut> I still don't understand how GN particles work
[1:02:27] <thepowerofpinsol> Why does the robot grunt when it jumps?
[1:02:27] <%Taisuru> Smooth like pats head
[1:02:30] <%joey_jo_jo_juniorshabadoo> It will be
[1:02:30] <+Thorn14> Femto is more Kojima Particles
[1:02:31] <%blaggablag> I love how the jetpack direction has literally nothing to do with the axis of lift
[1:02:32] <jcflyguy> Soundtrack is great too
[1:02:40] <+HouseofNonsense> I'll be real, I still don't get Minovsky Particles
[1:02:42] <%kyh9> heal zone
[1:02:46] <Asblom> The word "stamina" for a robot seems off
[1:02:47] <+Thorn14> the pilot is doing movements inside of the mecha
[1:02:49] <$frankthetank285> yeah been watching gundam again and this game makes me want a good gundam game
[1:02:50] <@commanderclaw> Damn for sure

[1:40:39] <Nekros4442> Femto? like Berserk?
[1:40:41] <%ArtoriasTheTrenchfighter> "Mech Carth" There's no escaping it huh
[1:40:42] <%Alpha8087> Past announcement ASMR
[1:40:42] <+Blargimazombie> Anthem rework looking sick
[1:40:43] <+lethallylactic> :B: attlefield
[1:40:43] <%croxeye> FEMTO seems to be healy stuff
[1:40:43] <%Pappajimbo> polygon dog
[1:40:44] <Mr_Rakjo> Isnt Femto Griffith evil name from Berserk @PatStaresAt
[1:40:45] <FennecZephyr> @PatStaresAt Serious answer: Fempto powers laser weapons
[1:40:46] <WanderingSwordsman> either this or next mission will explain it
[1:40:46] <xxmagonx> !uptime
[1:40:47] <@Moobot> I've been playing this game for how long? Oh only 1h 40m.
[1:40:48] <Marzby> Love you pat
[1:40:50] <%Punchasaur> Your mech is doing the caveman sponge bob pose
[1:40:54] <+tweedler92> Femto is for lasers and reviving partners
[1:40:54] <Jermatoo> @Valentinius_Anodyne Kicks the shit out of the Switch version
[1:40:56] <Apollo1818> @valentinius_anodyne It’s a good-ass port.
[1:40:58] <$PulverKong> yeah this is just your basic tutorial shit
[1:41:00] <CrimsonFox777> Femto is for those with both domination and foot fetishes. Kappa
[1:41:03] <%templar010> CHIRALIUM DENSITY INCREASING
[1:41:06] <SleepyMaribo> @PatStaresAt up and down on the d-pad will switch your femto energy to fliight speed, arms which is attack up and around you, which is defense up
[1:41:16] <TheGrayDrachen> Did he buy a pack or sometihng to get weapons at the start? I dont remember starting with anything
[1:41:20] <%demegodz> SUP
[1:41:21] <%SirGO0SE> yeah you broken in whore
[1:41:22] <%Sphincter_Spelunker> more games trying to convince Miura to continue Berserk
[1:41:24] <%Calek> is that One Punch Man's voice?
[1:41:36] <$KeroKamina> "THAT FUCKING ASSHOLE's STILL HERE?"
[1:41:40] <Hydrapissed> Truth
[1:41:43] <%ShichiNoBushi> "LIttle Rookie"? The main character from Is It Okay to Pick Up Girls in a Dungeon?
[1:41:48] <%ArtoriasTheTrenchfighter> They straight up call him a tool, omg
[1:41:51] <FirewallStorm> Holy shit this reminds me a lot of armored core
[1:42:12] <FennecZephyr> @FirewallStorm That's because it's basically off-brand armored core
[1:42:17] <%foreverN2dust> Is femto like higgs partical in Knights of Sidonia or trapar in Eureka Seven?
[1:42:17] <%kewlmyc> @ShichiNoBushi That was an out of nowhere pull
[1:42:18] <%SundanceShot> it's straight up made by former armored core staff
[1:42:19] <%cowardlord> Do you get to chose what company you join?
[1:42:19] <Zaphire_Saucypants> of course he does
[1:42:21] <zenith0111> But when's ZOE 3? :(
[1:42:25] <%worldbrand> why is femto such a big bar? what is it? is it mana?
[1:42:33] <Marzby> Did you ever play any more battle Royal games after PUBG??
[1:42:35] <Dova573> oh so hes a rich asshole
[1:42:44] <startstoprepeat> @worldbrand basically
[1:42:45] <Zaphire_Saucypants> "The Five Hells"....what, is there a guy calling himself Beelzebub too?
[1:42:47] <PKHTjim> They're talking, but not paying attention.
[1:42:48] <TheGrayDrachen> you can make a doppleganger with femto i think right?
[1:42:54] <$KeroKamina> ^yes
[1:42:55] <%worldbrand> oh so it's mecha space magic
[1:42:56] <%logoth_> Man there's a lot of talking in this game
[1:42:56] <$KeroKamina> yes you can
[1:42:59] <Nekros4442> This Deva guy is totally gonna fucking die
[1:43:02] <$KeroKamina> it helps alot in certain fights
[1:43:06] <%Xelgus> what in the fuck is a femtozone
[1:43:07] <Marpolo13> do they ever shut up
[1:43:07] <%Konquerer> do these people ever stop talking
[1:43:08] <$PulverKong> Femto is ammo for laser weapons
[1:43:09] <%Jack_of_No_Trades> get in the zone, femto zone
[1:43:10] <%ssjklyco> Femto is probably Limiter removal
[1:43:13] <%kewlmyc> GRIFFITH!!!!!!!
[1:43:19] <startstoprepeat> good luck playing this game with japanese audio and keeping track of what they're saying while playing
[1:43:19] <Hydrapissed> lol
[1:43:23] <$PulverKong> Femtozone lets you recharge your laser weapon ammo. That's all
[1:43:24] <MattDemers> This reminds me a lot of Project Sylpheed, a super-anime dogfighting game for the Xbox 360.
[1:43:27] <+Kurvera> Where's my screaming Richard! or shooting all your weapons at once screaming how do you like me now
[1:43:27] <+WeepProphet> Hourly reminder that Griffith did nothing wrong

[1:43:48] <AFlyingTaco1> Wasn't Femto the Megaman X bitch with the mechanical angel wings?
[1:43:49] <%demegodz> TEASING ME
[1:43:50] <$PulverKong> Laser ammo isn't replenishable like normal ammo. It's the femto meter
[1:43:53] <jcflyguy> Quick exit your mech
[1:43:53] <%Sphincter_Spelunker> @Hydrapissed was woolie talking?

[1:44:28] <%Alpha8087> You did the thing
[1:44:28] <Hydrapissed> that tag was bigger then ur robat
[1:44:28] <%Sphincter_Spelunker> Good ol Woolie "Ultimately, at the end of the day" Madden
[1:44:30] <Hydrapissed> that shit must be HUGE
[1:44:30] <$PulverKong> @SoaringLettuce dude this is the second tutorial mission. it's basic as fuck still

[1:45:02] <%Xelgus> attachment slots
[1:45:02] <$PulverKong> the first 5-6 missions are just tutorials. Then it opens up big time
[1:45:03] <startstoprepeat> one's a preorder bonus and is gold

[1:45:05] <Cdjgamer> one can have attachment
[1:45:05] <startstoprepeat> that is the difference

[1:53:32] <+SergeantSov> The game does not want you to heal your enemies
[1:53:33] <%TheSniperJoe> Melee weapons can start to due some STUPID damage in this game if you spec into them.

[1:55:34] <$PulverKong> but the switch version runs great
[1:55:38] <WayneTheNerd> Quentin Tarantino is strongest in the femtoe zone
[1:55:39] <%cowardlord> Who does your character work for?
[1:55:40] <Apollo1818> @aflyingtaco1 Okay, but better than docked IMO.

[1:56:14] <%ssjklyco> you can mech on the toilet
[1:56:15] <neVan0> LUL
[1:56:15] <+nictron90> What's wrong with the PC version?
[1:56:17] <Apollo1818> @zaphire_saucypants PC, Switch can get chunky
[1:56:18] <AFlyingTaco1> I didn't even realize he was playing the PC version. Thanks guys!
[1:56:23] <+DiabloDeAzul> switch has bad framerate, wouldn't recommend
[1:56:24] <%Merhabi> was that a joke or
[1:56:24] <%Taisuru> @nictron90 He's joking
[1:56:24] <terribleusername> he's lying
[1:56:26] <%Nina96> y the switch?
[1:56:26] <%croxeye> Pat's taking the piss dudes lol
[1:56:27] <Zaphire_Saucypants> Pat sayin one thing, chat the other....hmm
[1:56:27] <Heyestus> reminds me of Jehuty slipping around when it touches the floor too
[1:56:27] <$KeroKamina> @Zaphire_Saucypants anime like The Witcher
[1:56:27] <%TheMilhouseExperience> Did Pat get the tutorial for Trans Am?
[1:56:28] <+nictron90> oh oops
[1:56:30] <%punished_mug> psaElmo_TK
[1:56:30] <%vaporousTippler> Too many frames of animation on PC. It's distracting.
[1:56:31] <Valentinius_Anodyne> I love how the mechs slide in this, it's great
[1:56:31] <+Tswoooh23> Noce hair dood
[1:56:34] <FennecZephyr> Is there even free anime DLC for SxM switch? I thought that was only in japan
[1:56:34] <+nictron90> thanks @Taisuru
[1:56:36] <Metagalactic_> Is this game good now?
[1:56:39] <KaliasTV> Can't tell if intentional joke or brain afk
[1:56:40] <WanderingSwordsman> shhh not yet
[1:56:44] <%Flambage> @PatStaresAt Would you put Heelys on a mech?
[1:56:45] <terribleusername> that's in character though
[1:56:47] <%heartlesshealer> Pat missing legs
[1:56:49] <+Kingtut9009> So this is essentially Armored Core I'm assuming?
[1:56:50] <+Dre_> Zaphire_Saucypants pat is playing on PC
[1:56:52] <+Jaysky> Zaphire_Saucypants Pat was being sarcastic, Switch tends to drop in FPS
[1:56:52] <Riki_Mau> boutta be a lot of numbers
[1:56:53] <zenith0111> When your robot version has more hair than you NotLikeThis
[1:56:53] <%heartlesshealer> lore sustained
[1:56:54] <%Laecerelius> Lieutenant Pat, you ain't got no legs!
[1:56:55] <%linSP> feels good man?
[1:56:57] <+Grizzytron> pc has too many frames. as we all know, the human eye can only see at 20 fps
[1:56:57] <$PulverKong> Because the game was MADE for switch, then ported to PC.
[1:57:00] <%GarbageNirvana> So was it just the hardware it was on holding it back
[1:57:02] <SleepyMaribo> @PatStaresAt you can get those mechs, you have ot defeat them in battle and get them piece by piece
[1:57:03] <%spiritofmojave> head enbiggening
[1:57:03] <Zaphire_Saucypants> Aight, thanks all.
[1:57:07] <+ArtemisCroc> you have a skin on

[1:57:10] <%Tucker0603> unequip the skin
[1:57:10] <%heartlesshealer> FLAVOR
[1:57:12] <%kjsandwich> kjsandwich subscribed at Tier 1. They've subscribed for 3 months, currently on a 1 month streak! 
[1:57:13] <$PulverKong> this was a Switch exclusive until today
[1:57:14] <%Taisuru> DETAILED STATS PAT
[1:57:15] <trashcansan> the mecha has a pat gremlin pose
[1:57:17] <%Maids4lyfe> UNEQUIP THE SKIN
[1:57:19] <Riki_Mau> press X
[1:57:19] <Finaldragoon> UNEQUIP SKIN DUMMY
[1:57:19] <+jimmybeegood> idk, my Switch experience was solid. Obvivously doesn't have 60 FPS tho. But it's not distracting enough.
[1:57:20] <+D00msDayDan> the prototype skin is overwriting
[1:57:20] <%Tucker0603> YOU HAVE THE SKIN EQUIPED
[1:57:21] <FennecZephyr> @PatStaresAt Better stats in every way. Open the big stat page
[1:57:21] <Railgun5> You have to take off the Prototype Mech skin
[1:57:22] <+DiabloDeAzul> press x pat
[1:57:22] <+grim_abel> DURABILITY YOU DUMB
[1:57:22] <$KeroKamina> i think you need to equip it, it looks nothing like the new one
[1:57:23] <%kjsandwich> Hi
[1:57:23] <startstoprepeat> @pat the prototype thing you put on overrides all visual changes
[1:57:24] <+tweedler92> Gotta take off the skin
[1:57:30] <%Flambage> @PatStaresAt You must do the maths
[1:57:33] <Apollo1818> @fenneczephyr I think they released it, but made it legally distinct for the west aside from the Witcher DLC
[1:57:33] <%heartlesshealer> Yeah, take off the flavor
[1:57:33] <thebeastoutofthesea> The desert environment is enhanced with bombing. Left alone, it is too placid.
[1:57:37] <+A0N33> Also hit X once or twice to change what stats you see
[1:57:41] <%heartlesshealer> yay
[1:57:44] <%honeyman18> Left good, Right Bad
[1:57:44] <fairore> numbers

[1:58:27] <%WhereIsWill> IT WORKED
[1:58:27] <%cowardlord> Bug legs
[1:58:27] <%heartlesshealer> Stuck with old busted legs
[1:58:28] <Heyestus> you should be used to wanting different legs tho.
[1:58:38] <+Prinny_Raider> pat always wantin new legs
[1:58:43] <zenith0111> Can't wait to see Pat get pushed around atpRtsd

[2:05:20] <%depressed_skeleton> Womyn am i right, @PatStaresAt
[2:05:21] <MicrotonalMatt> This is almost out-edging Code Vein
[2:05:23] <$KeroKamina> all of savior's peopel are assholes

[2:05:35] <%goose_attack_almanac> Reaper REaper , thats what people call me
[2:05:42] <%Punchasaur> These voices bring the game down a whole point
[2:05:43] <+Qsmash_> touch it
[2:05:49] <+YakumoYomi> Why? Cuz they all die.
[2:05:52] <%cowardlord> KILL BUILDING
[2:05:53] <King_thunder365> @zenith0111 SAAAAAAAAAAAVE MEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEE
[2:05:54] <%snow_bush> $5 says we hav to kill them at some point.
[2:05:54] <+necrocannibal2> this game is not really doing it for me tbh, but playing it would be different maybe
[2:05:57] <Zarkith> One of the mercs with you has a weapon that shoots acid balls
[2:06:00] <AFlyingTaco1> God, I don't usually mind dubs, but this is pushing it even for me.
[2:06:06] <WanderingSwordsman> Shut up, they are great
[2:06:08] <%Jack_of_No_Trades> Please go back to muting the stream
[2:06:10] <arkv01> one gripe I have with this compared to armored core games is the sound design, firing guns feels like you're shooting peanuts
[2:06:10] <WanderingSwordsman> LUL
[2:06:10] <%heartlesshealer> ganguro and goth girls don't have good voices for listening to
[2:06:10] <+necrocannibal2> SHUT THE FUCK UP LITTLE GIRL
[2:06:14] <%Mr_Strut> I like gyaru twin
[2:06:15] <%heartlesshealer> in this game
[2:06:15] <Zaphire_Saucypants> go away Heavan.
[2:06:16] <%demegodz> Hm

[2:06:22] <Onamar> Eww english voices
[2:06:23] <$KeroKamina> thank god Heaven and Abyss don't show up much
[2:06:24] <Warbot40> This is a baaaaad dub. Like PS2 era bad.
[2:06:26] <SPKTR34> god dang these dubs
[2:06:26] <Rangenade> where is the mute button on this mech
[2:06:32] <zenith0111> Wtf are these characters?
[2:06:32] <WackyModder84> Are you able to change the language from English Dub to Japan Dub? Or is it only English Dub in the PC Version?
[2:06:33] <Darren716> YIPEE
[2:06:33] <%heartlesshealer> oh wait, is that type gyaru and not ganguro?
[2:06:33] <Zaphire_Saucypants> mmmmm

[2:06:38] <%Taisuru> YIPEEE
[2:06:38] <Zaphire_Saucypants> I wanna punch something
[2:06:39] <%GeneralHysterics> oh, she's about JUSTICE
[2:06:44] <$PulverKong> COOL SWORDS
[2:06:47] <arkv01> ps2 era armored core voice acting had a charm to how bad it was
[2:06:48] <%Punchasaur> This is like rwby tier voice acting in its awfulness
[2:06:48] <Apollo1818> @wackymodder84 Yeah, you can change the dub.
[2:06:50] <zenith0111> Hurray!.... MURDER!
[2:06:51] <+SergeEXE> is video game fun?
[2:06:51] <%GalacticaPhanto> Bruh this game looks way better when it runs on max settings
[2:06:52] <%AncelDeLambert> oh god, Pinkie is ten million times better voice acted
[2:06:55] <%Konquerer> why can't anyone be normal
[2:06:55] <+necrocannibal2> the Japanese voice would be just as annoying
[2:07:02] <+necrocannibal2> this character type is annoying
[2:07:04] <%heartlesshealer> Legs ignored!
[2:07:04] <AFlyingTaco1> So is this gonna go full-on Three Houses later and you're gonna have to choose who to fight with and who to kill?
[2:07:05] <+necrocannibal2> and should not exist
[2:07:05] <$KeroKamina> BUSTER DOOM
[2:07:06] <%Jack_of_No_Trades> 1 buster doom please
[2:07:07] <+Dr_Mooose> busta doof
[2:07:08] <%demegodz> BUSTER BOOM
[2:07:08] <%SundanceShot> nothing compares to the emeraude mission dude from AC 2
[2:07:12] <WaitHowDidIGetHere> Remember, kids, no one likes subtitles.
[2:07:14] <$PulverKong> the japanese voices would be even more annoying cos you don't understand what they're saying
[2:07:15] <Hellarussian> i dont like sand
[2:07:17] <fairore> @necrocannibal2 here here
[2:07:19] <%Tucker0603> Pat, you can clash in this game with enemy mechs with melee
[2:07:19] <vVAstrAVv> yeah the dub its fine the characters just suck lol
[2:07:21] <+Remery_> just yoinked his legs
[2:07:22] <zenith0111> Not gonna lie my hype boner is now half chub
[2:07:24] <%Huntercd> Bitch really is Pinkie Pie
[2:07:25] <FennecZephyr> @AFlyingTaco1 Sadly no, the game is entirely linear story wise
[2:07:28] <%Taisuru> TRICK GUN TRICK SWORD
[2:07:28] <Daxalog> Remember to grab some legs
[2:07:28] <%demegodz> What the fuck
[2:07:30] <%AncelDeLambert> remember, subtitles are for poor people
[2:07:30] <arkv01> man I'm getting thirsty for some armored core nexus
[2:07:31] <Zaphire_Saucypants> jesus christ
[2:07:32] <Hydrapissed> AYAYA
[2:07:33] <+Jaysky> What fuckin candy hoe
[2:07:34] <%Chimeraelite> A LOT OBVIOUSLY
[2:07:35] <%goose_attack_almanac> AYAYAY
[2:07:36] <%Punchasaur> What about a wolfendoom?
[2:07:39] <Zarkith> Heaven is the worst character BY FAR
[2:07:40] <+Thorn14> She's like Harley Quinn + A shitty anime girl
[2:07:41] <$KeroKamina> you can actually sorta style switch in this game
[2:07:43] <AFlyingTaco1> I can stand Japanese voices just fine though. This is nearing unbearable.
[2:07:44] <%cowardlord> The economy in this world must be awful
[2:07:45] <Zaphire_Saucypants> mmmm delicious wolfendoom
[2:07:45] <%Nina96> i really dont like these holy crap
[2:07:48] <%Scottigecko> she's got an incurable case of imouto
[2:07:56] <%Nina96> 2*
[2:07:58] <SPKTR34> hey isn't that audrey from huniepop?
[2:07:59] <fairore> @thorn14 so Harley quinn
[2:08:02] <StarlitStunner> Gyaru twins and Silver Chariot are better pilots than mustard Boivan
[2:08:06] <+YakumoYomi> @AFlyingTaco1 Nah, there's really no choices for you to make in the story. You're basically just there as the game railroads you along its plot.
[2:08:06] <%snow_bush> When does she get an incurable case of Isekai truck?
[2:08:08] <+Remery_> the japanesee voice would just be Doki Doki-ing all over the place
[2:08:11] <$PulverKong> this game isn't known for its great characters, I'll just say that
[2:08:19] <zenith0111> I hope she dies NotLikeThis
[2:08:21] <$PulverKong> but the fighting is awesome
[2:08:21] <+Zereaux> this game ist known
[2:08:22] <Paperware> Painkiller being the straightman here makes her even more unbareable
[2:08:27] <arkv01> not known for it's riveting plot
[2:08:31] <AFlyingTaco1> @yakumoyomi Well that's a massive missed opportunity. Oh well. Thanks!
[2:08:36] <$PulverKong> imagine these chicks screaming shit in japanese, how would that be better
[2:08:42] <%GeneralHysterics> man, shut up heaven.
[2:08:44] <+Blargimazombie> SHUT THE FUCK UP
[2:08:46] <%Typhaeon> EZ Clap

[2:08:47] <+SergeEXE> ONII-SAN
[2:08:47] <%Laecerelius> UGH
[2:08:48] <%SundanceShot> the game starts off pretty babytown but it gets harder, especially the optional stuff
[2:08:48] <bluebiscuit94> Onii-sama!
[2:08:48] <%demegodz> Incest
[2:08:49] <%DEETRz> praise it

[2:08:59] <%Monkeyweed21> I do not envy Blacknareff
[2:08:59] <%Jack_of_No_Trades> Painkiller has the patience of a saitn
[2:09:00] <+Zereaux> kimochi onisama
[2:09:01] <%Typhaeon> Jesus Christ she is insufferable
[2:09:02] <%Taisuru> Heaven is just the worst
[2:09:02] <%demegodz> I hate her
[2:09:02] <+Shadowpint> I at least can't understand the dumb shit they're screaming when it's in Japanese
[2:09:03] <%ssjklyco> Well, incest established
[2:09:03] <%cowardlord> LORD BOTHER?!
[2:09:03] <zenith0111> NO THANKS
[2:09:05] <bluebiscuit94> SASUGA ONIII-SAMA! VoHiYo
[2:09:05] <AFlyingTaco1> Please just give us Blacknareff for the rest of the game.
[2:09:06] <SPKTR34> @PulverKong well for starters they wouldn't sound like an old woman pretending to be a kid
[2:09:06] <%heartlesshealer> I never understood the incestual praise trope
[2:09:07] <%honeyman18> LuvBlondeR
[2:09:08] <Zaphire_Saucypants> she keeps getting worse and worse
[2:09:08] <%GarbageNirvana> Why does anything anime have to have something like this
[2:09:08] <$PulverKong> Oh btw you have online arena missions too
[2:09:09] <%goose_attack_almanac> ABYSS IS SO MUCH BETTER BECAUSE SHE HATES YOU AND DOESNT TALK

[2:11:33] <zenith0111> Cute goth girl needs a reality check
[2:11:40] <%heartlesshealer> buster doom actually looks alright
[2:11:41] <OverlordedK> Is somebody gonna warn him you craft new weapons from old ones
[2:11:41] <%Typhaeon> That's one gutsy sword
[2:11:43] <%Tucker0603> YOU CAN MELEE CLASH PAT
[2:11:43] <KitsuneManami> @PatStaresAt Did you play any of the late Armored Cores?
[2:11:50] <%Jack_of_No_Trades> sell bad guns
[2:11:55] <AFlyingTaco1> Where's the stupid fucking Omikron gun? Megazooka, I think it was called?
[2:11:58] <%Monkeyweed21> sell spare rifle
[2:11:59] <transporterthesequel> BUSTER DOOM
[2:12:00] <%TheMilhouseExperience> Swords don’t need ammo
[2:12:02] <%Punchasaur> Can you sell the twins to human traffickers?
[2:12:03] <%Grayhammatter> zero whole guns
[2:12:06] <arkv01> so do you still have to craft/salvage new equipment or can we buy shit now?
[2:12:11] <$PulverKong> You can melee clash with swords!
[2:12:16] <fairore> @punchasaur jeez
[2:12:16] <Zaphire_Saucypants> nah, just sell Heaven
[2:12:24] <arkv01> cause I remember having to salvage everything being a pain in the fuck
[2:12:28] <qu3kl41n_the_impure_king> yo SHOUTOUT to all the Ravens and Lynx out there!
[2:12:30] <FennecZephyr> Ya want a momster energy logo on your face
[2:12:34] <haisho> Pat declaring his aspirations up front
[2:12:38] <%BestTeaMaker> is pat making a china mech
[2:12:48] <+Remery_> nah just give heaven that bamboo muzzle from demon slayer
[2:12:56] <%Monkeyweed21> sell your spare rifle
[2:12:58] <zenith0111> Better dead than red
[2:13:08] <Apollo1818> @arkv01 You can buy stuff, but crafting/drops is actually faster from what I’ve played.
[2:13:20] <arkv01> I mean can you buy new stuff without crafting it first
[2:13:23] <Jack8274> I now want this game
[2:13:24] <ambadev> powerful mech squats
[2:13:27] <trashcansan> knifegun
[2:13:30] <%PanicSwytch> This soundtrack reminds me of Xenoblade chronicles X
[2:13:31] <arkv01> cause I played the whole game and did not seem to be able to buy new shit
[2:13:32] <OToole42> I can already imagine the next stream "So I did some grinding....and now money is no object"
[2:13:43] <startstoprepeat> equipping two swords might let you do a cool thing @PatStaresAt
[2:13:45] <Jack8274> SWORD AND SHIELD COMBO
[2:13:49] <%Tucker0603> @patstaresat try and melee another arsenal with a melee weapon, you can clash
[2:13:51] <%demegodz> TRICKSTER
[2:13:54] <+timmc916> Byg gunn
[2:13:58] <Apollo1818> @arkv01 Huh, I’m still in the middle of it. I dunno.
[2:13:59] <%TheMilhouseExperience> Wait until he gets the laser shit.
[2:13:59] <%Grayhammatter> trickster though
[2:13:59] <arkv01> compared to old armored core where new parts just get unlocked in the shop by story progression
[2:14:05] <+Remery_> Just become General Grievous
[2:14:09] <%Punchasaur> @panicswytch I CANT SEE YOU I CANT HEAR YOU
[2:14:12] <%GalacticaPhanto> Is Pat saying that hes Zeon's Red Comet? that his soul isnt weighed by gravity? @patstaresat
[2:14:19] <%Futurecity10> @PatStaresAt You get a new move if you equip two swords
[2:14:23] <ironwardog> yup
[2:14:24] <$KeroKamina> always have a swordo n hand
[2:14:25] <%cowardlord> Makes sense
[2:14:26] <Jack8274> But you might neeeeeed it later #mindgoblins
[2:14:27] <%Monkeyweed21> slot
[2:14:30] <zenith0111> Can we just appreciate the subtle absurdity of GIANT HANDGUNS
[2:14:30] <%heartlesshealer> one has paint
[2:14:31] <%MrBorisMakarov> slot
[2:14:31] <%Jack_of_No_Trades> has slot
[2:14:31] <%KnivesEve> yo didnt know this was on pc. is it good? @PatStaresAt
[2:14:31] <jcflyguy> Slot
[2:14:32] <%heartlesshealer> or slot
[2:14:33] <FennecZephyr> @PatStaresAt keep 2, actually, for dual weilding
[2:14:36] <%cureneckbeard> In case you need it later.
[2:14:38] <+uhgoat> swords and sniperss
[2:14:38] <%TheSniperJoe> Extra Weapons and Mech Parts can be used to make new equipment in the Factory, later on.
[2:14:40] <arkv01> minor quirks for insane people who want to customize
[2:14:43] <%mh9s> you equipment slut
[2:14:49] <%TheMilhouseExperience> Keep a build in mind
[2:14:53] <%CuppaHotJones> CuppaHotJones subscribed at Tier 1. They've subscribed for 6 months! Happy 6 month-iversary with the most correct streamer on Twitch!
[2:14:56] <+jimmybeegood> the hangar music is so good
[2:14:58] <bluebiscuit94> yea you love to see it
[2:15:07] <%heartlesshealer> extra parts are money early on, but scrap for building later on
[2:15:07] <Das_Wood> this dude is keeping his shield lmao
[2:15:16] <arkv01> go full melee
[2:15:22] <%TheMilhouseExperience> Make your favorite gundam type.
[2:15:22] <+Jaysky> Shield is for big cowards
[2:15:22] <youlookokgetin> you're ready to bust a fat doom
[2:15:23] <Das_Wood> he acknowledges his cowardice by keeping the shield
[2:15:23] <$frankthetank285> ok bye pat gotta go to work
[2:15:25] <mMayrro> breathing will now commence :)
[2:15:33] <arkv01> swap out all your human body parts so you'll never need to bathe :)
[2:15:39] <%cowardlord> Whats a neutral zone?
[2:15:41] <%heartlesshealer> Have a good day at work, Frank
[2:15:48] <%Punchasaur> “this dude” you must be new here
[2:15:59] <TheTakkster> this sounds like multiplayer
[2:15:59] <+timmc916> that tree has a nice house
[2:16:01] <%Futurecity10> yes
[2:16:02] <startstoprepeat> yup
[2:16:03] <%Monkeyweed21> you can
[2:16:04] <+Ghostfaceninja53534> @PatStaresAt So does this do the Amored Cores good ?
[2:16:05] <Zarkith> Free Missions are replayable, yes
[2:16:06] <bluebiscuit94> y
[2:16:06] <%GalacticaPhanto> This is just Gundam Build and Armored Core on crack
[2:16:09] <$KeroKamina> yes
[2:16:10] <arkv01> naw free missions become paid missions after
[2:16:11] <$PulverKong> you can replay missions as many times you wanna
[2:16:13] <$KeroKamina> you can replay free missions
[2:16:21] <%valriot> FEMTO?
[2:16:22] <Jack8274> Femto? Griffith? GRIFFFITTTHHHH!
[2:16:23] <%TheMilhouseExperience> Yes
[2:16:28] <PKHTjim> Why does the AI voice sound like Jehuty.
[2:16:41] <%cureneckbeard> Gotta go fast
[2:16:43] <FennecZephyr> @PatStaresAt And you're still slow as SHIT, too
[2:16:44] <$KeroKamina> you can also kill enemies as jsut hte Outer
[2:16:52] <Daxalog> These AI dont put up much of a fight now do they?
[2:16:56] <TheTakkster> just tuning in. this game looks rad. is this game rad?
[2:17:03] <wrydiculous> Kreygasm that splash damage Kreygasm
[2:17:08] <%TheSniperJoe> It's pretty rad.
[2:17:09] <%Punchasaur> @frankthetank285 oh hi tank. Danker beef
[2:17:13] <$PulverKong> it is rad but has terrible side characters
[2:17:17] <AFlyingTaco1> That's rad!
[2:17:22] <Zaphire_Saucypants> @TheTakkster seems so. Has some annoying characters and english dub
[2:17:24] <Apollo1818> @thetakkster I like it, and the PC version is far better than on Switch.
[2:17:25] <Valentinius_Anodyne> It's rad, and now the framerate is stable too
[2:17:43] <%Taisuru> psaCrazyhand psaCrazyhead
[2:17:44] <TheTakkster> rad
[2:17:47] <AFlyingTaco1> So is White Glint in this game or nah? And if nah, why not?
[2:17:56] <zenith0111> Can't believe the Switch can't handle this PS2 game
[2:17:59] <bxdragon> Nah
[2:18:00] <+Ghostfaceninja53534> how deep is the customization? We talking AC levels?
[2:18:04] <Hellarussian> its a Gundam
[2:18:07] <%GalacticaPhanto> psaJpeg
[2:18:12] <%honeyman18> psaWhat_BW psaCrazyhand psaCrazyhead psaWrong
[2:18:13] <$KeroKamina> @AFlyingTaco1 nah because this isn't AC
[2:18:16] <%KnivesEve> can you switch between eng and jp dub?
[2:18:17] <arkv01> its not quite AC, this is more monster hunter than AC customization
[2:18:18] <%Taisuru> @AFlyingTaco1 Not an Armored Core game, just basically one :V
[2:18:20] <+dmtjinni> Angriest PAT
[2:18:20] <%demegodz> WOOPS
[2:18:25] <%isolex_> oops
[2:18:27] <null_vortex> @ghostfaceninja53534 less parts than AC.
[2:18:27] <%isolex_> that building
[2:18:28] <$PulverKong> @Ghostfaceninja53534 you can swap out all body parts and weapons, but no heat sinks management and stuff
[2:18:32] <$KeroKamina> @Ghostfaceninja53534 customizaiton arguably goes deeper than AC if we're countign pilot customization
[2:18:36] <Valentinius_Anodyne> Yeah! New legs
[2:18:40] <Div_the_Penguin> so how is the port so far ?
[2:18:43] <$PulverKong> you can also customize you pilot
[2:19:02] <+Zereaux> wish this had a bit more zoe in it
[2:19:14] <arkv01> I was extremely uncomfortable with cyborgizing my cute anime pilot VoHiYo
[2:19:19] <bxdragon> Could do without the limb destruction
[2:19:21] <+Ghostfaceninja53534> OK Thank you to all who answered <3
[2:19:21] <$PulverKong> Also, Pat is only on the 4th tutorial mission so it's very basic right now
[2:19:27] <Unimpressions> This is the closest we're getting to having Armored Core on PC isn't it
[2:19:34] <$PulverKong> Yep
[2:19:34] <+Zereaux> yeah
[2:19:36] <+Jaysky> Correct
[2:19:42] <$KeroKamina> @Unimpressions legally atleast
[2:19:45] <LoveXKnife> goddamn the framerate is so much better
[2:19:46] <+Ghostfaceninja53534> some day
[2:19:47] <%GalacticaPhanto> Pat isnt trying to make Jehuty, hes trying to make Anubis I bet
[2:19:48] <Apollo1818> Unless you count emulation, yeah.
[2:19:50] <+Remery_> @arkv01 Just become 2B
[2:19:51] <arkv01> nah when From Software finally fuckin chills on the souls we'll get big robots again
[2:19:52] <%Taisuru> Gotta unlock combos
[2:19:52] <Zarkith> LOVE the Down Booster, so convinient
[2:20:06] <+Ghostfaceninja53534> until then its emu
[2:20:09] <$PulverKong> PS3 emulation runs like dogshit on my PC so I'm ruling that out
[2:20:11] <LoveXKnife> an Armored Core game with uncapped framerate would be a dream come true
[2:20:12] <+Jaysky> No arkv01 we'll get robot-souls
[2:20:17] <+Jaysky> And you'll love it
[2:20:19] <arkv01> I'll take robo souls
[2:20:19] <Div_the_Penguin> emulators were pretty close though texture glitches are a thing
[2:20:27] <Apollo1818> >implying FromSoft will ever go back to the formula before the one that prints money
[2:20:33] <Valentinius_Anodyne> Alas, FromSoft was too cowardly to put giant robots in Dark Souls
[2:20:40] <%Taisuru> You don't have melee combos yet pat
[2:20:50] <$PulverKong> you will unlock chain combos
[2:20:51] <arkv01> big robo was From's bread and butter for like a decade
[2:20:55] <Jack8274> It doesn't do much more damage than the gun
[2:20:55] <+timmc916> these mechs are absolute units
[2:20:58] <+Thorn14> JYet
[2:21:01] <jcflyguy> Only Katanas can combo
[2:21:04] <%Tucker0603> two melee weapons
[2:21:05] <+Ghostfaceninja53534> i think we'd all love a mechasouls
[2:21:05] <+Jaysky> But seriously if they release a mecha Souls-like I'll wet my pants
[2:21:06] <%TheMilhouseExperience> Remember each weapon has an effective range.
[2:21:08] <$twitchyal> At least From let Metal Wolf get released in the west, but this game looks awesome at the moment.
[2:21:09] <arkv01> then they was like wait that souls hoe looks pretty good, moving on now
[2:21:11] <$KeroKamina> @PatStaresAt chain combos are katana only
[2:21:18] <bxdragon> Katana like weapons only
[2:21:24] <%Punchasaur> I feel like the switch version must have been unoptimized since it ran like shit but Astral Chain performed fine
[2:21:27] <bxdragon> Big boi swords and hammer don't combo
[2:21:36] <LoveXKnife> in an alternate universe, ACV was a massively successful F2P game on PC
[2:21:36] <BonzoBeanMachine> I personally count Tower Knight from Demons Souls as a grounded mecha
[2:21:43] <+VariantX7> Sweet lord, its beatiful, I can see all 60 frames in the space of a second...
[2:21:46] <AFlyingTaco1> @valentinius_anodyne Maybe they're working their way up towards it. Like they're at the middle ages with Elden Ring, and we just left ancient Japan with Sekiro so maybe in like twenty years we'll get Mech Souls.
[2:21:48] <$PulverKong> yea these tutorial missions go fast
[2:21:52] <arkv01> I think pats gonna get bored of these babby ass missions in half an hour
[2:21:57] <%ShichiNoBushi> FOUR: "That's enough. You can stop now."
[2:22:08] <Nekros4442> Are there different melee weapons? Like not just swords
[2:22:18] <dowmein> @PatStaresAt Can I bug you about Armored Core on PC again like I did at Magfest? Also play dead with hangar dog. :U
[2:22:21] <$PulverKong> Try to hit the button to exit your mech next mission
[2:22:22] <bluebiscuit94> DRUGS
[2:22:24] <scrumbotime> Up the downboost
[2:22:24] <$KeroKamina> helps you fall fast
[2:22:25] <null_vortex> @lovexknife both ACV and ACVD are popular in Japan.
[2:22:25] <%BlueMoonBlues> Boosts down
[2:22:27] <Hellarussian> it boosts the down
[2:22:27] <filialpails> BOOST DOWN STUPID
[2:22:28] <Zarkith> Lets you descend faster
[2:22:28] <%heartlesshealer> hard drop
[2:22:28] <$PulverKong> you can jump and fly around as a human too
[2:22:32] <%Monkeyweed21> it boosts your downs
[2:22:32] <+Plankman> it boosts down
[2:22:34] <%depressed_skeleton> numbers go DOWN
[2:22:34] <%honeyman18> so the bonus missions are duck hunts for extra cash
[2:22:36] <+Jaysky> The opposite of an up booster
[2:22:37] <wrydiculous> boosts down faster
[2:22:38] <%heartlesshealer> think tetris
[2:22:40] <LoveXKnife> once you get the more speedy upgrades this game becomes really fun
[2:22:45] <arkv01> dude I fucking remember when we had armored core locals
[2:22:47] <+Ghostfaceninja53534> but falling fast go up
[2:22:52] <%TheMilhouseExperience> They help you descend faster
[2:22:53] <$twitchyal> @PatStaresAt Mecha are for ever, I love them, and need more!
[2:22:54] <arkv01> did YOU SUPPORT YOUR SCENE CHAT?
[2:22:55] <Apollo1818> It boosts you down, Pat. :)
[2:22:57] <+AMadHollow> obviously it down boosts, these plebs in the chat.
[2:22:57] <+grim_abel> lIGHTER
[2:22:58] <+timmc916> rule of cool
[2:23:00] <%radda343> look at all that number go up
[2:23:05] <bluebiscuit94> Lighter you mean
[2:23:07] <Jack8274> It's lighter?
[2:23:10] <$PulverKong> Basically goes from AC to Gundam head
[2:23:12] <%Tucker0603> it looks cooler though
[2:23:13] <+Jaysky> Big number or do combo
[2:23:18] <doggieo> Pretty handy
[2:23:20] <+D00msDayDan> hold square to boost straight down
[2:23:22] <LoveXKnife> @arkv01 i WISH I had armored core locals
[2:23:23] <%Taisuru> Quick drop basically
[2:23:25] <$twitchyal> God I miss armored core.
[2:23:27] <LeafarOznolam> how do you like the robot game mr streamer
[2:23:32] <LeafarOznolam> LuvPeekR
[2:23:41] <%Taisuru> STRANDS
[2:23:42] <bluebiscuit94> NAKAMA
[2:23:42] <+AMadHollow> BUT PAT, YOU NEED TO DOUBLE DOWN ON YOUR BOOSTS
[2:23:43] <Nekros4442> KIZUNA!!!!!
[2:23:45] <dowmein> play dead with the hangar dog
[2:23:46] <$PulverKong> You constantly unlock cosmetic stuff it's great
[2:23:50] <LoveXKnife> down boosters so you can tri-jump like marvel
[2:23:57] <$PulverKong> and you can play with the dog
[2:23:59] <$KeroKamina> Bridges
[2:24:00] <+dmtjinni> I'm rolling a fat blunt rn @PatStaresAt
[2:24:00] <%Monkeyweed21> Cut off your legs
[2:24:06] <$KeroKamina> sell the auto-gun too
[2:24:07] <%heartlesshealer> When will Pat get more body mods?
[2:24:09] <bxdragon> Wait no don't!
[2:24:21] <bxdragon> You could have probably made something with it later as a part.
[2:24:30] <arkv01> armored core locals were insane, the builds were usually just blades and overboosting
[2:24:31] <$PulverKong> yeah fuck fleshy parts
[2:24:34] <+luketrapwalker> GET CYBER LEGS
[2:24:35] <%PanicSwytch> ICE CREAM?
[2:24:36] <Quietshun13> but how will you walk
[2:24:37] <+Plankman> paraplegia monkaS
[2:24:37] <$KeroKamina> DOUBLE JUMP
[2:24:38] <%spiritofmojave> You have negative legs to sell tho
[2:24:39] <Nekros4442> But do you keep your dick?
[2:24:40] <+Ghostfaceninja53534> ok now i see
[2:24:41] <Valentinius_Anodyne> yeyeye
[2:24:42] <WanderingSwordsman> its a part for crafting
[2:24:42] <+grim_abel> double jumpu
[2:24:42] <%heartlesshealer> as long as it was a farmable item
[2:24:44] <%D3rrtyD4n> fuck those useless legs
[2:24:44] <%Jack_of_No_Trades> double jump like mario
[2:24:44] <%Tucker0603> double jump
[2:24:45] <bluebiscuit94> Double jump
[2:24:45] <+luketrapwalker> AIR DASH?
[2:24:47] <youlookokgetin> TOILET X MACHINA
[2:24:47] <LoveXKnife> HURRAY TRANSHUMANISM
[2:24:47] <+Plankman> no end lag
[2:24:48] <Man_in_the_Red> so will pat replace all his body parts like the ship of theseus?
[2:24:48] <+Remery_> Become 2B!!
[2:24:49] <FennecZephyr> Landing recovery time
[2:24:49] <Zaphire_Saucypants> double juuuump
[2:24:50] <%Tucker0603> DOUBLE JUMP
[2:24:52] <%Monkeyweed21> Double jump
[2:24:52] <doggieo> Will he get beefy skinny or average legs
[2:24:53] <%PaladinDupre> DOUBLE JUMP
[2:24:54] <+Thorn14> double jump is out of mecha
[2:24:54] <ClicheHiei> reduce double jump
[2:24:57] <$PulverKong> You still haven't been out of your mech, pat. There is a button to exit the mech mid mission
[2:24:57] <%Broand> Oh thanks for the sub @MrBorisMakarov
[2:24:58] <+Jaysky> Note: Please do not cut off your legs.
[2:24:58] <Zarkith> Reduced Landing because you're not gonna be out of your mech often
[2:24:59] <%PaladinDupre> ITS A DOUBLE JUMP
[2:25:02] <FennecZephyr> Are you ever going to be out of the mech? @PatStaresAt
[2:25:04] <arkv01> just gonna taper your expectations now, you CANNOT enhance your ass
[2:25:05] <%heartlesshealer> what's down right of double jump?
[2:25:05] <%PaladinDupre> TWO JUMPS
[2:25:05] <LoveXKnife> fuck out of Mecha shit you don't need it at all
[2:25:05] <%MrBorisMakarov> np @Broand
[2:25:07] <$KeroKamina> YOU CAN GET OUT OF YOUR MECH WHENEVER
[2:25:08] <%Tucker0603> BUT IT LOOKS COOL
[2:25:08] <+Ghostfaceninja53534> double jump is usually pretty good in most games
[2:25:09] <bluebiscuit94> Landing time then, be efficient
[2:25:10] <%Taisuru> DO NOT DOUBLE JUMP
[2:25:10] <Zaphire_Saucypants> why would you not?
[2:25:10] <bxdragon> Never get outer crap
[2:25:12] <%PaladinDupre> YES
[2:25:12] <%dmdyne99> BIG JUMP OR MOAR JUMP?
[2:25:13] <+grim_abel> TWICE THE JUMPS
[2:25:14] <jcflyguy> For some missions yes
[2:25:15] <%Tucker0603> yes
[2:25:15] <+AMadHollow> DOUBLE JUMP IS STRONK
[2:25:17] <%TheMilhouseExperience> Outer moves kinda suck
[2:25:18] <LoveXKnife> only for like one mission
[2:25:18] <$PulverKong> @PatStaresAt Yes there is a button to exit your mech
[2:25:25] <Amardeux> Get the Reduced Landing Recovery
[2:25:31] <+DiabloDeAzul> yes, if you blow up you'll be out as the pilot
[2:25:34] <%linkster291> You do have missions when forced out of the mech.
[2:25:36] <arkv01> I've actually ran out of ammo before and hado to finish some missions outside the mech LUL
[2:25:37] <LoveXKnife> out of Mecha upgrades are useless
[2:25:38] <bxdragon> Always go for Arsenal stuff.
[2:25:39] <%heartlesshealer> only if grounded
[2:25:39] <vVAstrAVv> you can get out whenever

[2:26:17] <+senfood> Ok, this game has me now.
[2:26:21] <wrydiculous> there are outer missions, but you dun quite need the upgrades yet
[2:26:27] <$PulverKong> and of course you can upgrade these weapons too. ALOT.
[2:26:31] <arkv01> YO THIS IS FUCKIN MONHUN
[2:26:32] <FennecZephyr> is it though? Are you gonna be wanting to fight like this on the regular?
[2:26:32] <+Mitchellsocks> There's something very "action figure" about the character's movement
[2:26:32] <%PaladinDupre> you can get a sword arm too
[2:26:34] <%Punchasaur> It’s PSO now
[2:26:34] <SundarkSoldier> this game is sick as hell

[2:26:40] <+DisasterJensen> looks dope
[2:26:41] <%linkster291> To steal thigns from other mechs.
[2:26:42] <arkv01> it's STRAIGHT UP JUST THE SHOCK TRAP
[2:26:42] <%heartlesshealer> Ah, there's body missions, but not at that point yet apparently
[2:26:43] <%Agami23> remember that the electric mine doesen't work on elder dragons
[2:26:45] <$twitchyal> I am glad I bought this game.
[2:26:46] <SundarkSoldier> everybody buy it
[2:26:48] <%Punchasaur> You got a mag and everything

[2:26:50] <%D3rrtyD4n> everything besides the story and characters seem cool
[2:26:50] <%ryome> Throwing my piss grenades!
[2:26:51] <BonzoBeanMachine> Freedom Wars II looking good
[2:26:52] <doggieo> When your mech blows up
[2:26:52] <s1rcuit> Nier: Automota by the looks of it
[2:26:56] <SundarkSoldier> also you can completely customize your hud
[2:26:57] <FennecZephyr> @PatStaresAt This is basically a mode for you to use if your mech gets destroyed in coop and you still want to contribute
[2:26:58] <$PulverKong> and then you just jump back in
[2:26:58] <%rytyoung> Star Fox Assault?
[2:26:59] <SundarkSoldier> check it out
[2:26:59] <%Tucker0603> @patstaresat you can equip yourself with a energy blade too by getting the blade upgrade
[2:27:02] <Nekros4442> Wait.....does this game have Bits? Like from Gundam?

[2:27:29] <%heartlesshealer> BECOME TOILET WARRIOR
[2:27:30] <%ssjklyco> Getting a LEG up on the competition
[2:27:30] <%Taisuru> Pat finally chopped off his legs like he always wanted
[2:27:31] <$PulverKong> We are Raiden soon
[2:27:32] <+senfood> Robot limbs are clearly superior to flesh ones.
[2:27:34] <Zaphire_Saucypants> now Pat is a Fuck Nugget
[2:27:34] <trashcansan> arms gtfo
[2:27:35] <%radda343> sword arm tho
[2:27:37] <%TheSniperJoe> You can spec pretty heavily into "out of the mech" it's weird.
[2:27:42] <doggieo> Full amputee
[2:27:43] <%rumtumtugnutz> You just missed out on having a sword arm you know
[2:27:44] <+timmc916> Pat is slowly becoming dryer
[2:27:46] <+grim_abel> You chose to punch farther instead of a sword
[2:27:46] <%ryome> Where we’re going, we won’t need limbs!
[2:27:48] <+luketrapwalker> I think it's only the one arm tho???
[2:27:49] <+Remery_> The last level takes his soul
[2:27:50] <LoveXKnife> but will you cut your dick off
[2:27:52] <arkv01> chat please rmember PAT WANTS TO SHED HIS FLESH COIL ASAP
[2:27:53] <%Wallabri> beep boop
[2:27:53] <%valriot> Truly, you are becoming the Machina
[2:27:55] <+AMadHollow> a true manlet in the making
[2:27:55] <$PulverKong> There totally is a "out of mech" spec
[2:27:55] <Zaphire_Saucypants> oh shit a sword arm?
[2:27:56] <%depressed_skeleton> Am *i* a robot?
[2:27:56] <$twitchyal> gUN ARM?
[2:27:57] <%PaladinDupre> but you could have had a double jump and a sword arm
[2:27:57] <%SirGO0SE> Patron MK II
[2:27:58] <Heyestus> Surely this will have no dire consequences later in the game.
[2:28:01] <+senfood> @Zaphire_Saucypants Why would you put that image in my head?
[2:28:01] <King_thunder365> It's Darth Maul, but with ROBOT LEGS
[2:28:02] <wrydiculous> Pat is on his way to toasterhood
[2:28:03] <%GarbageNirvana> So do they keep your human parts on ice or just throw 'em out or what
[2:28:03] <mMayrro> but can you get a mechanical penor?
[2:28:04] <qo_op> pat becomes a cyborg and instantly gets malware
[2:28:05] <%TheMilhouseExperience> Eat ice cream pat
[2:28:07] <+ianabstract> the immortals are going to hack your kidneys
[2:28:08] <%heartlesshealer> no, just crush your dick in your new robo arms
[2:28:11] <+timmc916> "i did ask for this"
[2:28:11] <%ryome> FINALLy
[2:28:14] <%cureneckbeard> Hey Pat, if you lost your legs in an accident but could get robot legs, would you get regular sized legs, or Pat sized legs?
[2:28:15] <Zaphire_Saucypants> @senfood Becase...I can.
[2:28:15] <pirateofpie> What's the point of out of mech upgrades?
[2:28:18] <%PaladinDupre> you lost your limbs for what? some passive buffs?
[2:28:19] <%Dementedpenguin> Today: armless. Tomorrow: toilet.
[2:28:19] <+luketrapwalker> Was that just for the ONE arm?
[2:28:22] <+grim_abel> Pat's left leg is gonna get hacked.
[2:28:24] <arkv01> is it time for DAEMON X MACHINA?
[2:28:27] <Valentinius_Anodyne> Slowly, Pat will become free of the weakness of the meat
[2:28:27] <%Punchasaur> Replace your head with a Dreamcast
[2:28:30] <+Remery_> Android Pat has no need for Ice Cream
[2:28:30] <$PulverKong> @pirateofpie you can spec into being stronger out of mech than in mech
[2:28:31] <+Ghostfaceninja53534> "It's a risky operation but i think it's worth it."
[2:28:39] <+Celtic_Queen> Hey chat how is this game?
[2:28:41] <$PulverKong> it's literally an option
[2:28:45] <LoveXKnife> I have the feeling like the story was rushed, and it initially was supposed to have way more branching paths
[2:28:47] <zenith0111> "AI"
[2:28:51] <Zaphire_Saucypants> Pat, the fuck nugget, let's goooooO!
[2:28:54] <trashcansan> you need at least one human arm tho. always keep one human arm
[2:28:54] <%rumtumtugnutz> The real Daemon X Machina was the people we met along the way.
[2:28:57] <+AMadHollow> fuck, pat would totally trade his body for a robot that has gross oil pits instead of fleshy organs.
[2:29:01] <pirateofpie> @pulverkong ....Huh. Interesting
[2:29:01] <%lyyyyraaaa> Pat’s going to get rid of his butthole next
[2:29:02] <KazMkII> @Celtic_Queen It's pretty dope if you like more Arcadey Armored Core
[2:29:04] <%valriot> Oh yeah, shoot that Big Hot Deck
[2:29:05] <%heartlesshealer> Hacking is always the risk of becoming an immortal toilet, Pat
[2:29:08] <+grim_abel> NASA is gonna hack your eyes Pat
[2:29:10] <$KeroKamina> @Celtic_Queen if oyu're a mecha fan or an armored core fan you should absolutely buy it
[2:29:15] <%heartlesshealer> it is the price you pay
[2:29:18] <Bloodredwaterbottle> Hey pat if these guys are immortal how are you killing them?
[2:29:18] <%spiritofmojave> Pat needs a whistling butthole like 2B!

[2:31:32] <+Thorn14> Boosts either damage, speed, or shield
[2:31:33] <KazMkII> @PatStaresAt Wings make you boost FAST, arms make your hit HARDER
[2:31:33] <$KeroKamina> @PatStaresAt adjusts your speed, power, defense, etc.
[2:31:35] <%heartlesshealer> stat modes
[2:31:38] <jcflyguy> Shield blocks shots, wings boosts you fast, gloves boost damage
[2:31:38] <Zaphire_Saucypants> doggo
[2:31:38] <bxdragon> Bracelets=attack
[2:31:39] <+Celtic_Queen> So are we all anime-type game fans here? (Astral chain, Fire Emblem, Animal Crossing etc.?)

[2:57:33] <%goose_attack_almanac> @PatStaresAt So the Mech stuff is cool but every sequence outside a Mech where people are talking is awful?
[2:57:34] <Kingdom_65> It's typical American voice acting that makes it sound fucking BOOOOORING

[2:59:31] <%Punchasaur> HELLO I AM PAT-TRON 420
[2:59:32] <%cureneckbeard> hi jack
[2:59:33] <%SirGO0SE> Sounds like Caspar a little
[2:59:38] <zenith0111> So far all the dialogue has been cringe
[2:59:40] <%cowardlord> Stop talking
[2:59:41] <DaniReDux> "Welcome to the Femto Zone!"
[2:59:42] <%D3rrtyD4n> damn
[2:59:45] <%CaityCoopScoops> hahaah SAME GIRL
[2:59:49] <arkv01> chat we could literally write a better story together than the hot gluey mess we're seeing
[2:59:51] <%Typhaeon> What a savage
[2:59:52] <%Keyd00d> why we fight
[2:59:54] <%Scottigecko> this one, this is the one
[2:59:54] <%MintDepression> what are they fighting for?
[2:59:55] <Kingdom_65> I've never really been able to get into the "big robots" aesthetic. Feels sort of meh to me, I dunno.
[2:59:55] <AFlyingTaco1> Of course they have the quiet tsundere sniper girl
[2:59:56] <mastermidget23> Why do they fight!
[2:59:58] <%cureneckbeard> Such a tsundere shouldn't exist
[2:59:58] <%BlueMoonBlues> Hey chat, does the PC version of this have dual audio?
[2:59:59] <bluefooddye1> Ah yes, the tsundere waifu option
[3:00:00] <Warbot40> sounds like a younger claude from 3 houses
[3:00:01] <TheTakkster> Can uh...can we switch to japanese VA's?
[3:00:02] <KazMkII> Because it's a Mech game
[3:00:02] <+YakumoYomi> As someone who played through the entire game on Switch, I can confirm that the plot is best ignored. It gets really dumb by the end.
[3:00:03] <haisho> all the normal people died
[3:00:04] <%Punchasaur> aminay
[3:00:04] <%cureneckbeard> Hmmph! nyannTsun

[3:01:24] <%Tucker0603> TIS MUSIC
[3:01:25] <+socialistOtter> I've been here for like two minutes and my complaint is they won't shut up and let you robot fight
[3:01:28] <KazMkII> Switch to neutral
[3:01:31] <%ssjklyco> No wonder rookie is so good. Everyone spends a lot of time talking
[3:01:34] <tmanner> so why is the factor of 15 so important?
[3:01:38] <startstoprepeat> both wing and barrier auto turn off when you attack
[3:01:41] <zenith0111> OMG SHUT UP
[3:01:42] <AFlyingTaco1> Remember how in Armored Core you could choose which merc company you wanted to work for, and there were like global rankings and wars and shit?
[3:01:49] <+machshop> that's not a good thing
[3:01:49] <+YakumoYomi> ALWAYS USE ARM MODE. DAMAGE GO UP AND SHREDS ENEMIES
[3:01:50] <%Typhaeon> Notice: Femto Bone Zone
[3:01:51] <+wellshuckit> Is there going to be a charicter trying to kill all war by taking over the earth?
[3:01:51] <+Jaysky> Morgana has gotten a lot of voice work recently
[3:01:52] <%spiritofmojave> Femto word counter when
[3:01:52] <%ssjklyco> Femto created the golden age
[3:01:54] <wrydiculous> trickswordgunroyal
[3:02:00] <%thegreenbenis> Kojima's Mech game @PatStaresAt
[3:02:05] <trashcansan> I understand the need for plot but they need to stop talking
[3:02:07] <transporterthesequel> god it IS style switching
[3:02:09] <Valentinius_Anodyne> Rookie's the only guy who actually focuses on his work
[3:02:10] <%Jack_of_No_Trades> Please no talk, just fight
[3:02:11] <%Keyd00d> I'M ME
[3:02:13] <%Dementedpenguin> This conversation feels so forced.......
[3:02:13] <%Punchasaur> EXCUUUUUUUUUUSE ME PRINCESS
[3:02:15] <YourPalFrost> did you cut your hair pat?
[3:02:16] <zenith0111> BRUH SHUT UP
[3:02:16] <TheTakkster> I like how she has exactly one emotion and tone of voice and inflection
[3:02:17] <FennecZephyr> @PatStaresAt Speed and Armor will auto-cancel if you attack
[3:02:22] <+ZephynM> I am hearing 9S and Makoto?

[3:02:37] <%StaceMcGate> Wait, that's Fie from Trails of Cold Steel
[3:02:38] <MattDemers> Man it bugs me that these lines will play EVERY TIME YOU PLAY THIS MISSION
[3:02:38] <+BootyFriend> Has he already done the White Glint spin?
[3:02:39] <DSD24> So I'm gonna be honest I really like the gameplay in this game, but the story in the AC games was way better
[3:02:39] <Nekros4442> .....is Jack a Re:Zero?
[3:02:39] <wrydiculous> kill me please
[3:02:40] <%cureneckbeard> Strong Pokemon, weak Pokemon. Those are just the selfish opinions of people. True champions try to win with their favorites.
[3:02:40] <arkv01> this is a strand type game, all plot is delivered via the seamless gameplay :)
[3:02:41] <AFlyingTaco1> Yikes jesus this conversation
[3:02:41] <%AncelDeLambert> shut the fuck up!
[3:02:42] <$KeroKamina> "YEAH I CAN ONLY DIE ONE TIME HEHE"
[3:02:45] <hzealot> he totally didnt mean it just as a joke
[3:02:47] <startstoprepeat> people die when they are killed
[3:02:47] <%spiritofmojave> People die didja know
[3:02:48] <%worldbrand> why is it that this would be endearing in ace combat but it's just annoying here
[3:02:49] <%AncelDeLambert> SHUT UP
[3:02:50] <Unimpressions> There's good trashy mission dialog, like in Ace Combat and Armored Core, and then there's bad mission dialog. and this, this is Baaaaaaaaaaaad
[3:02:51] <Hydrapissed> hes an immortal
[3:02:51] <Zaphire_Saucypants> all this dialogue is so uninteresting, it's going in one ear and out the other.
[3:02:57] <zenith0111> HOLY SHIT WTF
[3:02:57] <+vicar_anat> uh oh he said the, "changing the world" line, he's got to be the villain
[3:02:59] <+wellshuckit> god they are still talking........
[3:02:59] <wrydiculous> we are here to blow shit up, not gundam seed philosophy
[3:03:00] <%AncelDeLambert> AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAA

[3:03:21] <arkv01> maybe if one of the NPCs was a GIANT perv this would be more interesting
[3:03:23] <AFlyingTaco1> LYL
[3:03:23] <%Keyd00d> MORE TALK
[3:03:24] <Apollo1818> Get ready for Jack to turn into an asshole for a really shallow reason in the next mission he appears in.
[3:03:25] <+Jaysky> Opposite necrocannibal2
[3:03:26] <bxdragon> @necrocannibal2 Who lied to you?
[3:03:27] <wrydiculous> Thank you Four
[3:03:27] <+the22cstomp> no one said it was good, but it's cheesy
[3:03:40] <zenith0111> Lyrics? wtf?
[3:03:42] <+necrocannibal2> Pat opened saying that the plot wasn't that bad, lol
[3:03:45] <arkv01> oh wow this looks really good with the better FoV
[3:03:48] <+socialistOtter> I miss Armored Core so bad
[3:03:49] <zenith0111> Why is the music overly hype? XD
[3:03:51] <%goose_attack_almanac> I really hope Jack dies
[3:03:53] <%Punchasaur> THIS IS A LONGER CONVERSATION THAN ANYTHING IN EVA
[3:04:02] <%Typhaeon> As bad as the story & characters are, the mechanics look fuckin awesome
[3:04:08] <%worldbrand> i thought that he said that the plot *was* bad
[3:04:09] <$KeroKamina> @zenith0111 this entire soundtrack is amazing
[3:04:11] <%realm_forge> @patstaresat is there a way to turn off the dialogue?
[3:04:17] <arkv01> @socialistOtter I feel you man... go to your (ghost) weeklies
[3:04:19] <+necrocannibal2> @worldbrand that might be it
[3:04:24] <dking0000> I can’t tell if Pat is having fun or not, he looks so dead
[3:04:27] <%Laecerelius> Just land on his head. Smart
[3:04:27] <KazMkII> Pat switch to Femto arms for better Sword Damage
[3:04:38] <zenith0111> @kerokamina Yeah I noticed on the Tutorial missions with guitars blaring LUL wtf
[3:04:40] <$KeroKamina> @Typhaeon gameplay is fun and thankfully you don't need to interact with the story too much for the multiplayer
[3:04:42] <%Jack_of_No_Trades> Do I hear lyrics?
[3:04:43] <AFlyingTaco1> @dking0000 Listening to this dialogue, I can feel my brain cells dying too
[3:04:46] <Zaphire_Saucypants> @PatStaresAt You havin' fun, Pat?
[3:04:50] <$KeroKamina> @Jack_of_No_Trades yes
[3:04:51] <arkv01> pat sit back and let the robot make you coom
[3:04:57] <%worldbrand> did he died
[3:04:57] <zayasu> F?
[3:05:07] <%AncelDeLambert> @PatStaresAt enjoying yourself, big guy?
[3:05:08] <KazMkII> SNIPER PogChamp
[3:05:12] <thebeastoutofthesea> So is the real Femto gonna show up at some point or what are they getting at with all this "Femto" talk?
[3:05:12] <%Jack_of_No_Trades> @KeroKamina Oh man I have my volume low I thought I was going nuts
[3:05:12] <AFlyingTaco1> So what is this game's multiplayer like? PVP? PVE?
[3:05:14] <+socialistOtter> maybe you'd do better if you spent less time talking about how you'd die a hundred times to save the earth
[3:05:15] <%Laecerelius> I DID ALL THE WORK YOU DUMB BITCH!
[3:05:21] <%Punchasaur> @dking0000 tfw when you wanna have fun but dialogue says no
[3:05:22] <trashcansan> PAT DID ALL THE WORK
[3:05:27] <$KeroKamina> @AFlyingTaco1 both
[3:05:31] <%kyh9> Do damage
[3:05:33] <+D00msDayDan> it has a cooldown
[3:05:33] <KazMkII> Once it drains it leaves
[3:05:36] <SleepyMaribo> it drains then recharges
[3:05:38] <jcflyguy> It has to recharge
[3:05:41] <Zarkith> Each armament has its own meter
[3:05:42] <%TheMattman1313> Look at the meters
[3:05:43] <hntronium> Do I hear lyrics?
[3:05:45] <Zaphire_Saucypants> recharges
[3:05:46] <%averyoddjew> cooldown
[3:05:47] <bluebiscuit94> ICONS under the BARS
[3:05:47] <%kyh9> Shield regenerates while you're doing damage
[3:05:49] <+BootyFriend> It's ready again
[3:05:50] <Rangenade> See the 3 circles below femto
[3:05:50] <KazMkII> It drains when you USE it
[3:05:51] <FennecZephyr> Snipers are strong in this, but you need a head with enough range to make it work
[3:05:51] <doggieo> Femto
[3:05:52] <arkv01> your manjuice, duh
[3:05:53] <%Taisuru> Demto
[3:05:53] <%SirGO0SE> ooo Notes and Claude are the same voice actor
[3:05:55] <%TheMattman1313> Right 3 circular meters
[3:05:56] <+the22cstomp> it explained this
[3:06:00] <$KeroKamina> @AFlyingTaco1 it started with PVE co-op, then they added PVP. 1v1, 2v2, etc.
[3:06:00] <+D00msDayDan> the 3 circular icons to the right
[3:06:00] <%Monkeyweed21> look at the things beneath femto meter
[3:06:02] <WanderingSwordsman> @patstaresat the last 3 circles are your meters
[3:06:04] <%kyh9> Each of them has a usage amount
[3:06:09] <Apollo1818> @aflyingtaco1 Both. Co-Op missions and PvP
[3:06:12] <KazMkII> It does that too
[3:06:13] <%CaityCoopScoops> between the music taking a butt-rock turn and all this diologue im kinda cold on this game
[3:06:13] <%kyh9> No, femtos are used for another mechanic
[3:06:13] <%Keyd00d> Do not steal from Femto
[3:06:15] <Zarkith> And left of those meters is the durability of your individual body parts
[3:06:16] <+Shadowpint> Man I just don't like any of these characters
[3:06:17] <%realm_forge> Deez nutz
[3:06:18] <FennecZephyr> @PatStaresAt There's cooldowns. Look at the circles with the hexagons
[3:06:18] <SleepyMaribo> @PatStaresAt there is a ZOE style blink dash
[3:06:30] <AFlyingTaco1> @kerokamina @apollo1818 Interesting. Thanks guys.
[3:06:32] <%worldbrand> now i want a cone of mango, shit
[3:06:35] <+BootyFriend> If you have two rifles equpped you can do a cool spin from AC4A
[3:06:36] <+tweedler92> Yeah icecream!
[3:06:42] <hzealot> @PatStaresAt your character looks like less successful Dr Robotnik just sayin
[3:06:45] <+timmc916> Soluless polar bear
[3:06:46] <%Punchasaur> i really wanna buy this but the dialogue has me hesitating
[3:06:50] <%코코꾸라> Please don't insult the polar bear :(
[3:06:51] <Zaphire_Saucypants> yeah, I was interested in this game, but after seeing the dialogue and a good portion of the characters, my interest has waned.
[3:06:51] <+socialistOtter> I'm fine with this ice cream mechanic I just want the characters to shut up
[3:06:51] <%cureneckbeard> Get a robot belly so you can eat more ice cream
[3:06:56] <%Jack_of_No_Trades> I could go for some ritas water ice now
[3:07:01] <%thegreenbenis> Embrace your anger and become angriest pat
[3:07:06] <%Papa_Tak> Papa_Tak subscribed with Twitch Prime. They've subscribed for 18 months! did you see the kfc branded crocs?
[3:07:09] <%worldbrand> @Punchasaur same, and i dont think i would play the multiplayer so i think that's what's stopping me
[3:07:12] <FennecZephyr> @PatStaresAt The fempto determines the limit of how high the cooldowns can go
[3:07:13] <arkv01> you would not buy this for the plot or dialogue, you buy it only if you are going to film mech porn
[3:07:14] <Rangenade> There is some high mobility shit you can do if you manage your speed femto and stamina
[3:07:18] <%heartlesshealer> Azrael and Punishment
[3:07:25] <%heartlesshealer> hmm
[3:07:28] <%valkuma> shorties are op
[3:07:28] <+tweedler92> @Punchasaur its easier to deal with in Japanese
[3:07:31] <KazMkII> Snipers are dope
[3:07:32] <%nofestu2> or a hat
[3:07:34] <Zarkith> Shotguns are pretty good against Arsenals
[3:07:39] <+necrocannibal2> @arkv01 yeah then why the fuck won't they shut up
[3:07:43] <%heartlesshealer> this menu pose though
[3:07:46] <arkv01> @necrocannibal2 exactly
[3:07:50] <startstoprepeat> i like the sword/shotgun combo
[3:07:56] <%heartlesshealer> what
[3:07:57] <%spiritofmojave> what
[3:07:58] <%Typhaeon> Gnomenatos sounds like a snack food
[3:07:58] <CptVolkow> Those guns need stocks
[3:07:59] <%Keyd00d> Pat factory
[3:07:59] <jcflyguy> Get gnome'd
[3:07:59] <+necrocannibal2> what
[3:07:59] <@commanderclaw> Gomenesorry
[3:07:59] <hntronium> GNOMES
[3:08:02] <Thalchampz> HOO
[3:08:02] <Zarkith> HOOH
[3:08:03] <%valkuma> two assault rifles for ais, and two shotties for arsenals
[3:08:04] <+necrocannibal2> WHAT
[3:08:05] <%thegreenbenis> GNOT A GNOBLIN
[3:08:05] <haisho> I can't believe gnomes survived the AI apocalypse
[3:08:05] <%doc_ock_rokc> It GROWS PATS?!?!!
[3:08:06] <%nofestu2> OH HOHOHOHO
[3:08:06] <bluebiscuit94> It's a PAT factory
[3:08:06] <%Monkeyweed21> hehe you got gnome'd
[3:08:06] <eyedol33> Lookin almost MetalWolf style
[3:08:12] <%thegreenbenis> NOT A GNEFL
[3:08:13] <%templar010> GNO-MA-TOES?!
[3:08:14] <%thegreenbenis> GNELF
[3:08:22] <+timmc916> Gno survivors
[3:08:23] <Samurai_Jake> This game is so underrated
[3:08:23] <$KeroKamina> @necrocannibal2 certain story missions they do talk less, it's usually important plot missiosn or tutorial missions where they never stop talking
[3:08:28] <%Typhaeon> The world must have gnomenato chips
[3:08:32] <%SirGO0SE> hey @PatStaresAt any shot you do another FE3H stream? would much enjoy
[3:08:42] <CptVolkow> I bet you can take its CPU
[3:08:43] <%heartlesshealer> shooty shooty bang bang
[3:08:44] <%thegreenbenis> Huhuhuhu you've been gnome'd
[3:08:49] <AFlyingTaco1> So are there S-Links in this?
[3:08:53] <arkv01> no
[3:08:54] <+timmc916> Gnome-Mentos Factory
[3:08:55] <arkv01> no S links
[3:08:57] <$KeroKamina> @necrocannibal2 there's also the free missiosn andm ultiplayer missiosn that have no talking except from Four
[3:08:57] <%Punchasaur> KomodoHype
[3:08:59] <AFlyingTaco1> Thank god
[3:09:00] <arkv01> also wow this depth of field is AMAZING
[3:09:11] <%heartlesshealer> probably not for flying enemies
[3:09:13] <DSD24> Dual SMGs are OP
[3:09:15] <Zarkith> Against ARSENALS they kinda are
[3:09:16] <+necrocannibal2> does the environments go beyond deserts?
[3:09:18] <KazMkII> @PatStaresAt Sniper has a prefered range for better damage just like Shotguns
[3:09:18] <haisho> you're still early game though
[3:09:23] <%Laecerelius> I'd imagine shotties are good for the big guys
[3:09:24] <+socialistOtter> it's possible this one just sucks
[3:09:26] <%doc_ock_rokc> They said against Aresenals they are OP
[3:09:31] <KazMkII> YOU GOTTA GET THE RANGE CORECT PAT
[3:09:31] <%Taisuru> Gee not the first one you got who'd have thought
[3:09:39] <%bevyrage> psa1guy
[3:09:40] <%flagi64> @patstaresat just joined, is the game any good?
[3:09:45] <arkv01> yeah theres industrial style installations, but deserts are the predominant field
[3:09:45] <%heartlesshealer> so shotguns are anti-pilot?
[3:09:57] <buerdo> I fell asleep earlier has he fought any big things yet?
[3:10:00] <FennecZephyr> Shotguns are OP with high speed builds that let you get in close, get a shot off, then get out in the same instant
[3:10:06] <%Typhaeon> LuL
[3:10:06] <haisho> THE WALL
[3:10:10] <%heartlesshealer> DOUBLE SHIELDING
[3:10:10] <%thegreenbenis> THE WALL
[3:10:11] <%doc_ock_rokc> DARK SOULS BUILD
[3:10:11] <bluebiscuit94> DOUBEL SHIELD
[3:10:12] <Valentinius_Anodyne> DROP YOUR SHIELD
[3:10:14] <arkv01> game should've been just immortal fihts every othe rmission
[3:10:14] <%Maids4lyfe> omg
[3:10:15] <bluefooddye1> Literally invincible
[3:10:17] <+D00msDayDan> TAR-KUS TAR-KUS TAR-KUS
[3:10:18] <%thegreenbenis> NOTHING ON EARTH CAN MAKE IT FALL
[3:10:18] <%SirGO0SE> Dark Souls strats LUL
[3:10:18] <bluebiscuit94> SMART AI
[3:10:19] <%blaggablag> DUAL WIELDING COWARDICE
[3:10:20] <+necrocannibal2> NO MAN ON EARTH CAN MAKE IT FALL
[3:10:21] <DSD24> If only there was a giant Dad build
[3:10:23] <$KeroKamina> @necrocannibal2 Deserts, destroyed cities, Forset-cities, snowy highways, ocean rigs, underground tunnels, and the final boss area. that's all the enviroments
[3:10:24] <Rangenade> Just like in AC you can specifically build for reload speed , so you can shoot the shotgun as fast as you can reload
[3:10:25] <%cureneckbeard> Perfect
[3:10:28] <%cowardlord> I want 2 shields, this is bs
[3:10:29] <arkv01> when your balls are SO SMALL you gotta double shield
[3:10:35] <+necrocannibal2> @KeroKamina I see. that makes it more interesting to me.
[3:10:41] <FennecZephyr> YO THAT WAS A GOOD HEAD DROP
[3:10:46] <%heartlesshealer> just two shields and shoulder weapons
[3:10:46] <%thegreenbenis> THE WALL
[3:10:47] <+necrocannibal2> @KeroKamina I'll probably see some more to decide tho
[3:11:03] <%Punchasaur> 2 shotguns requires 2 shields
[3:11:21] <%doc_ock_rokc> These are adds
[3:11:22] <arkv01> wasn't there like ONE ocean rig mission
[3:11:23] <%ForlornCarton> the mechs Pat
[3:11:25] <KazMkII> You gotta kill the COMMANDER pat
[3:11:27] <%averyoddjew> the target is the commander, pat
[3:11:27] <arkv01> and then they didn't use it after that
[3:11:30] <+TheSaintJohn> it only counts other mechs
[3:11:30] <+xBolts4Lifex> So hows the game?
[3:11:31] <%Monkeyweed21> Did pat not pay attention to the briefing
[3:11:36] <bluebiscuit94> COMMANDER IS TARGET
[3:11:46] <bluebiscuit94> HEAL
[3:11:46] <+Pendragwn> big kill all the things
[3:11:47] <%thegreenbenis> @Monkeyweed21 Pat is illiterate
[3:11:50] <eyedol33> I'm impressed that pats almost dead
[3:11:53] <Zaphire_Saucypants> focus Commander
[3:11:54] <%heartlesshealer> Thanks mirage
[3:11:55] <$KeroKamina> @xBolts4Lifex really good, but hope you have a high tolerance for occasional A N I M E
[3:12:05] <+xBolts4Lifex> @KeroKamina i bleed anime
[3:12:08] <%Monkeyweed21> You had to kill the commander Pat
[3:12:12] <%averyoddjew> ARM
[3:12:12] <KazMkII> Dual Shotgun time PogChamp
[3:12:15] <%heartlesshealer> left arm
[3:12:17] <bluebiscuit94> ARM
[3:12:20] <+socialistOtter> I'm hopeful that since From has had so much recent success that means one day there will be another good Armored Core game
[3:12:24] <$KeroKamina> BIG ARMS
[3:12:24] <SleepyMaribo> if you want ot get op in this game though you have ot go online, since online missions give insane rewards
[3:12:27] <haisho> Now Pat can have TWO fap arms
[3:12:28] <%Typhaeon> psaBig ARMS
[3:12:29] <%Punchasaur> ARMS
[3:12:30] <Valentinius_Anodyne> Yeah! Symmetry!
[3:12:32] <%Teintstein> I'm Pat

[3:12:55] <%yeknomlive> yeknomlive subscribed at Tier 1. They've subscribed for 17 months! 
[3:12:57] <KazMkII> @PatStaresAt You were supposed to focus on the commander
[3:12:57] <haisho> too busy dicking with mobs to pop the commander
[3:12:58] <+IncredibleMeh> PEE PEE

[3:13:10] <%cureneckbeard> psaGib
[3:13:10] <Zaphire_Saucypants> for MAXIMUM pettage
[3:13:10] <Frostydough1> this any good?

[3:13:20] <%heartlesshealer> yeah, I was surprised
[3:13:21] <KazMkII> EFFECTIVE RNAGE PAT
[3:13:21] <%linSP> they was
[3:13:22] <%foreverN2dust> bolth
[3:13:24] <%Monkeyweed21> you are bad so you should use rifles
[3:13:24] <%goose_attack_almanac> oooooh nooo
[3:13:28] <%WhereIsWill> pretty trash lolol
[3:13:29] <haisho> Critical Distance, Pat
[3:13:29] <doggieo> Every weapon feels weak tbh
[3:13:30] <%MintDepression> watching this game just makes me wish we had gotten a zone of the enders 3...
[3:13:30] <%heartlesshealer> I guess they have hard range limits
[3:13:41] <%BringBackSempai> Pat, you should know the effective range of video game shotguns by now
[3:13:43] <KazMkII> try Dual shotguns in the training menu to test damage
[3:13:43] <doggieo> Except the smgs
[3:13:44] <%D3rrtyD4n> psaElmo blep
[3:13:44] <arkv01> just cheese everything with SMGs like every other goddamn AC game
[3:13:45] <hntronium> Optimal ranges
[3:13:46] <%goose_attack_almanac> The Storm thats coming in Canada is gunna be so bad that ViaRail had to stop running some of its trains
[3:13:46] <%Laecerelius> If the shotties require you to basically be in melee range to be effective you might as well just use melee weapons
[3:13:47] <%cowardlord> psaElmo psaElmo psaElmo
[3:13:47] <+Pendragwn> @PatStaresAt can we have an elmo cam for just elmo and nothing else

[3:13:58] <%heartlesshealer> psaWink
[3:14:00] <%Monkeyweed21> You're bad and should use the rifles
[3:14:03] <SleepyMaribo> yeah every weapon does meh damage, you basically make your mech tanky as fuck to outlast everything.
[3:14:05] <KazMkII> Deaul shotguns is OP get in thier face for best damage
[3:14:06] <DSD24> There's some real jobbers in this game
[3:14:06] <%Scottigecko> psaGib psaGib
[3:14:10] <DamnGoodCake> elmo power up

[3:14:24] <jcflyguy> Dual SMG is stupid
[3:14:30] <$KeroKamina> BECOME LESS HUMAN
[3:14:33] <arkv01> SMG cheese meta has been unchanged for 20 years
[3:14:38] <KazMkII> Big gun shoot slow
[3:14:40] <arkv01> thanks darmeon x machina

[3:15:19] <+socialistOtter> just unlock all the decals from the start
[3:15:24] <+KingGoblodyte> centimeters?
[3:15:26] <+socialistOtter> unless they have story meanings
[3:15:27] <%ScreamLord> @PatStaresAt You got the Monster logo on your shoulders
[3:15:27] <arkv01> just put double micromissiles on your shoulder and dual shields, the smartest build :)

[3:35:06] <%heartlesshealer> Shotgun is secretly bullet melee, from what I'm reading in chat
[3:35:08] <Rangenade> Shotguns get crazy , if your arms have a high reload speed stat you can fire as fast as you can reload
[3:35:22] <Saltmeisterr> @Rangenade sick
[3:35:25] <jcflyguy> Nothing beats dual SMG
[3:35:39] <KazMkII> Equip dual shotguns for even more damage
[3:35:40] <Axle13j> I love being a fast boi with dual smg
[3:35:58] <+the22cstomp> pat it's a shotgun
[3:36:07] <+D00msDayDan> have you considered getting close with the shotgun?
[3:36:17] <KazMkII> 105 rounds PAT
[3:36:26] <+the22cstomp> 105 rounds vs 35
[3:36:31] <%heartlesshealer> it's either point blank or this one just flat out sucks
[3:36:31] <xeros720> yeah, lot more ammo
[3:36:36] <FennecZephyr> @PatStaresAt Shotgun also doesnt make you stop in your tracks when you shoot
[3:36:37] <Zarkith> Bazooka has low ammo though
[3:36:42] <%Typhaeon> 105 vs infinite
[3:36:49] <+the22cstomp> why not both
[3:36:49] <+senfood> Big number > many little numbers
[3:36:54] <FennecZephyr> Personally, I like dual rifles and snipers
[3:36:59] <xeros720> yeah, backup melee weapons is really good
[3:36:59] <+the22cstomp> 4 weapon slots
[3:37:06] <%Shadicara> Go BIG or go home
[3:37:10] <FennecZephyr> And SMGs are my preferred close range option
[3:37:12] <Twichty> what is this zone and who is its ender?
[3:37:15] <zenith0111> Did you know it only takes your brain 10 seconds to know if you like something?
[3:37:16] <fazoburquina> A shotgun does little Combo really fast
[3:37:18] <+YakumoYomi> Dual SMG shreds enemies so quickly that it's rarely worth using anything else. Against standard enemies and enemy Arsenals, they're probably the "optimal" choice.
[3:37:20] <%heartlesshealer> equip two melees at once?
[3:37:20] <$KeroKamina> i always machine gun, bazooka, acid rounds, katana
[3:37:23] <Zarkith> Personally, I like going Assault Rifle, Bazooka, Sword, and [Cool Post-game Weapon]
[3:37:29] <%heartlesshealer> see if you can alternate for combo
[3:37:29] <ErinTheInkeeper> @PatStaresAt whats the katana like
[3:37:29] <doggieo> KATANA is what you need
[3:37:29] <$KeroKamina> you cna duel wield melee
[3:37:31] <%Laecerelius> If only Pat could've gotten that cool laser sword
[3:37:35] <FennecZephyr> @PatStaresAt Try twin machine guns?
[3:37:40] <Axle13j> yeah i ended up not liking melee in this game. i was really lookin forward to some cool melee
[3:37:41] <xeros720> melee weapons are a little rare
[3:37:57] <%luftraumm1> faster sword seemed better
[3:38:01] <hntronium> Not gonna upgrade your body?
[3:38:01] <%heartlesshealer> well, you can test when you have more stuff
[3:38:03] <%코코꾸라> They're rare
[3:38:03] <%templar010> Not gonna try hammer?
[3:38:04] <%heartlesshealer> body mods!
[3:38:07] <xeros720> later ones are real good with outer mods
[3:38:08] <doggieo> They dont combo they chain
[3:38:08] <FennecZephyr> @PatStaresAt I think you have 2 silver eagles or whatever
[3:38:10] <%nofestu2> I have learned sword
[3:38:13] <jcflyguy> Oh god these
[3:38:13] <%heartlesshealer> body mods for skill
[3:38:14] <hntronium> oh noooo
[3:38:15] <Zarkith> He doesn't have a hammer with which to try @templar010
[3:38:19] <hntronium> escort missions
[3:38:19] <$KeroKamina> thankfully this mission isn't too bad
[3:38:21] <%TheSniperJoe> You learn to chain attacks later on and you learn how to do like...x-cuts.
[3:38:31] <Axle13j> try not to run the escort over LUL
[3:38:37] <jcflyguy> You can equip 2 to do an X Slash, but katanas can change between multiple targets

[3:42:14] <%CalderGaming> you don't have time to waste on sword clashes this time
[3:42:17] <%Shadicara> Just loot at the end pat you get a minute
[3:42:19] <+YakumoYomi> Are you using the Damage Mode (press the d-pad)?
[3:42:22] <+timmc916> lol no biggie
[3:42:27] <Zaphire_Saucypants> this looks like it requires precision equipment
[3:42:36] <Saltmeisterr> he should save his rocket ammo
[3:42:37] <%cowardlord> Do you keep loot if you fail the mission?
[3:42:38] <FennecZephyr> Or just moving super fast
[3:42:52] <%heartlesshealer> slide across cars for the big lose
[3:42:57] <zenith0111> atpMunchies Whoa
[3:43:10] <KazMkII> @PatStaresAt Dont forget style switcing patrick
[3:43:15] <%Skittlesoul> shoulder mounted missles work better here
[3:43:22] <+timmc916> wear the cars like shoes and run them out of the mission area
[3:43:25] <%Laecerelius> Why are they in slow-ass cars in this world of giant mechs?!
[3:43:36] <Animorphimagi> I wish there were ZOIDS mech designs
[3:43:38] <%Laecerelius> Seriously, I'm sure you could pick them up and just boost htem out of the zone
[3:43:45] <+Pendragwn> @Laecerelius better mileage
[3:43:49] <Zaphire_Saucypants> mmm Zoids
[3:44:03] <Axle13j> they could probably stand to drive a little faster
[3:44:04] <$KeroKamina> @Animorphimagi if it's any onsolation i think you can make a centaur mech
[3:44:10] <hntronium> @Laecerelius They'd probably die from inertia
[3:44:10] <KazMkII> Distract them
[3:44:17] <+YakumoYomi> Anything other than just Bipedal mechs in this game would be rad.
[3:44:24] <$KeroKamina> you fly them away from the target
[3:44:25] <KazMkII> GET AGRO PAT
[3:44:36] <%cowardlord> use the femto clone
[3:44:42] <%Skittlesoul> sword is a bad time
[3:44:44] <zenith0111> Maybe by not having a shitty mecha atpCap

[3:45:20] <Animorphimagi> Bird mech could be sick. But tiger speed would be so cool
[3:45:22] <JackalKing> How weighty are the mechs in this game? I remember in the demo my biggest complaint was that nothing had weight to it and it was really floaty
[3:45:24] <doggieo> it can get even beefyer
[3:45:38] <+senfood> Pointy!
[3:45:40] <%BringBackSempai> psaCrazyhand psaCrazyhead
[3:45:44] <%Laecerelius> ain't got no laser defense

[3:46:10] <xeros720> they can get heavy if you gear for it, but that just affects momentum and speed

[3:47:28] <nuane> oh, structure?
[3:47:30] <+YakumoYomi> Later on, you'll probably want to farm bosses for money. With a good setup, the missions only take a few minutes.
[3:47:35] <Zaphire_Saucypants> mmm, structure.

[3:55:08] <%Shadicara> Just jealous gunfort is bigger than your robot
[3:55:08] <%yeknomlive> man i didnt even know this game was coming out for pc
[3:55:25] <Xehnkent> It's got some of the same staff as older Armored Core games too
[3:55:29] <%Laecerelius> Yeah it just kinda popped up on steam for preorder last week
[3:55:54] <Ketronox> What's the consensus so far? Good game? Lame?
[3:55:55] <KazMkII> Smack them KNEES pat
[3:56:02] <%yeknomlive> i have it on switch but didnt get that far
[3:56:04] <Saltmeisterr> gud gaem
[3:56:07] <%TheSniperJoe> Bust open the knees with your melee weapon, it does HUUUUGE damage.
[3:56:17] <%Laecerelius> Go for the knees, Pat! It should be a given for you to go for the kness!
[3:56:26] <$KeroKamina> @Ketronox consensus is good game, high tolerance for A N I ME required with story mode
[3:56:36] <%doc_ock_rokc> Are you sure thisn't isn't warframe we got a thumper here
[3:56:37] <xeros720> someone earlier said it best, 7 game, 9 mecha game
[3:56:40] <Axle13j> at least it didn't knock you into the red barrier LUL
[3:56:58] <Bustahhwulf> thank umbasa they talk less now LUL
[3:57:03] <%Futurecity10> Man, this music is hardcore
[3:57:08] <TheyCallMeVawn> GRIFFISU
[3:57:11] <$KeroKamina> in the demo version of this boss you could take the boss's gun and shoot it back at him
[3:57:12] <Axle13j> Umbasa BlessRNG
[3:57:12] <%Laecerelius> The balls are inert
[3:57:13] <HairballCT> good kitty
[3:57:17] <Ketronox> @KeroKamina I was raised on garbage anime. @xeros720 That sounds great to me.
[3:57:29] <%worldbrand> welp it's dead, i'm glad we sure definitely killed it
[3:57:37] <FennecZephyr> yes
[3:57:39] <KazMkII> Yes and there are upgrade CHIPS pat
[3:57:40] <Zarkith> It also depends on your leg's stats, but yes
[3:57:41] <%CalderGaming> also in the demo/prototype version, the zone limit had no time period before you failed due to zone-out
[3:57:42] <+internetexplorer11> sure
[3:57:44] <+D00msDayDan> it's not weight, different parts have speed multipliers
[3:57:44] <%linkster291> Yes kind of.
[3:57:48] <Axle13j> parts also just make you fast but yeah that too
[3:57:49] <doggieo> Theres flight speed and ground speed
[3:57:51] <%linkster291> Litter armor has a higher top speed.
[3:57:52] <%rooooooooooot> no
[3:57:55] <%linkster291> A new sheild.
[3:57:58] <captain_rockbear> ground speed is more based on legs
[3:58:00] <%Monkeyweed21> its cuz of your gross veiny white arms
[3:58:06] <hntronium> tons of upgrades
[3:58:08] <jcflyguy> Progress towards boss stuff. Better get to eating ice cream!
[3:58:09] <hntronium> nice
[3:58:10] <FennecZephyr> Weight makes it harder for your leg and torso thrusters to push you
[3:58:15] <FennecZephyr> So you go slower
[3:58:16] <%Skittlesoul> boss blueprints
[3:58:19] <%Laecerelius> You carved those from its corpse?
[3:58:32] <xeros720> boss mechanic, repeat bosses to make boss exclusive things
[3:58:35] <zenith0111> atpRtsd atpRtsd atpRtsd atpRtsd
[3:58:37] <Zarkith> You get an item for each core you destroy
[3:58:39] <captain_rockbear> weight doesn't have a huge effect on speed
[3:58:50] <%Skittlesoul> you need 100% for research
[3:58:53] <hntronium> ZERO
[3:59:10] <%Futurecity10> I remember in Armored core you could import Decals. And I remember my friend imported Massive anime titties
[3:59:12] <Flarepulse> has pat met Sif yet
[3:59:17] <DesuDesuDokiDoki> what is this game?
[3:59:19] <mMayrro> just destroy it 4Head
[3:59:22] <Zarkith> Daemon X Machina
[3:59:23] <Axle13j> this mission's fun
[3:59:25] <hntronium> Read the title
[3:59:28] <+BizarreRevolver> killed her super hard
[3:59:30] <fazoburquina> @Flarepulse like 3 missions ago
[3:59:30] <Zaphire_Saucypants> @Flarepulse chunky pink haired lady? Yes.
[3:59:32] <hntronium> And the category
[3:59:35] <%Kilagn> Massive anime titties PogChamp @Futurecity10
[3:59:36] <hntronium> Its right there
[3:59:39] <FennecZephyr> That is true, the biggest factor to your speed is the boost speed stat on the chest and legs
[3:59:40] <$KeroKamina> @DesuDesuDokiDoki it's like Armored Core but with a No More HEroes esc artstyle
[3:59:45] <%Futurecity10> Oh, this mission
[3:59:51] <%Futurecity10> Might want to bring a shogun
[4:00:01] <DesuDesuDokiDoki> @KeroKamina thx
[4:00:01] <Zaphire_Saucypants> He doesn't like the shotty
[4:00:08] <%rooooooooooot> a shogun eh
[4:00:10] <$KeroKamina> i dont' think shotgun's needed for this mission
[4:00:10] <+socialistOtter> um. once the first AI with a gun gets 'corrupted' why do you keep including AI
[4:00:15] <%AncelDeLambert> thanks Big Bo
[4:00:15] <+socialistOtter> in your war machines
[4:00:21] <Flarepulse> I need to see if she suits my degenerate tastes

[4:00:42] <$KeroKamina> @socialistOtter because they're unmanned vehicles and weapons
[4:00:54] <%AncelDeLambert> @PatStaresAt are you glad to see Big Bo back?
[4:00:55] <$KeroKamina> these two are way better blackmen than Artist
[4:00:57] <xeros720> the ai produce other ai guns, it is a problem
[4:01:06] <%AncelDeLambert> them damn ROBOTS!
[4:01:12] <Zaphire_Saucypants> death flag

[4:01:18] <%AncelDeLambert> THE ROBOTS ARE HAVING OUR CHILDREN!!!
[4:01:19] <nikoloas_> welp he's dead
[4:01:21] <AFlyingTaco1> But let's be honest, Four is the best character in the game.
[4:01:21] <+senfood> A bonus for Bone Box
[4:01:21] <xeros720> nice bonus
[4:01:21] <KazMkII> Outside of the WASTELAND pat
[4:01:31] <%Laecerelius> So he has Guile-like hair AND he's a family man
[4:01:35] <Axle13j> 'cause he's a douche
[4:01:39] <%D3rrtyD4n> ok
[4:01:43] <arkv01> look bone box has a thing for BONING rookies
[4:01:45] <%storkeylope> Linear Line is such a dumbass name

[4:01:50] <bluefooddye1> "We" did it Kappa
[4:01:53] <nuane> thats just how the military is.
[4:01:53] <AFlyingTaco1> Painkiller is alright.
[4:01:57] <$KeroKamina> @AFlyingTaco1 i mean i wanna say you're wrong but
[4:02:02] <mMayrro> why is everyone in this game such a huge dick
[4:02:03] <%Jack_of_No_Trades> Calling it now: the AI is trying to kill these idiots cause they are awful
[4:02:07] <$KeroKamina> abotu 4 i mean
[4:02:08] <Zaphire_Saucypants> 400 year criminal service?
[4:02:09] <%Monkeyweed21> 400 YEAR SENTENCE
[4:02:10] <KazMkII> 400 year prison sentence PogChamp
[4:02:12] <Zaphire_Saucypants> jeez
[4:02:15] <+waltzqueen> 400
[4:02:17] <DesuDesuDokiDoki> n-n-no baka!
[4:02:17] <%Laecerelius> Gun Empress has been pretty cool so far
[4:02:19] <Ferakin> Nameless straight from Freedom Wars
[4:02:20] <Nekros4442> ALL THE CRIME
[4:02:22] <zenith0111> WTF IS THIS DIALOGUE
[4:02:24] <%doc_ock_rokc> He fucked an AI
[4:02:32] <+waltzqueen> Namless inviting him in for "Coffee"
[4:02:37] <arkv01> best character in the game is automatically char cause SIEG ZEON
[4:02:41] <splatterroomtacos> Time to go the Super jail for your Super Crimes
[4:02:42] <xeros720> bone crimes, like paige
[4:02:50] <TonberryLives> "why" describes basically all of the dialogue
[4:03:06] <Zaphire_Saucypants> this dialogue is at least manageable
[4:03:11] <arkv01> the plot has the audacity to rebuff the player with "BUT SHUTUP THO"
[4:03:20] <seth45er> the mech looks like it skips every leg day
[4:03:23] <Ketronox> Why did they make 10 cards for this game? The badges are gonna be so expensive. :/
[4:03:23] <$KeroKamina> but shut up tho, ark
[4:03:41] <AFlyingTaco1> @zaphire_saucypants Nah dude, you just haven't seen the really awful characters yet
[4:03:44] <arkv01> I did, never went back after the credits
[4:03:52] <TurtlesAndTentacles> Thanks for the LuvOops @okentucky
[4:04:06] <$KeroKamina> @arkv01 so oyu missed outo n the Geralt and Ciri DLC and PVP?
[4:04:11] <hntronium> Guns Empress and Regret have been cool so far
[4:04:16] <Zaphire_Saucypants> @AFlyingTaco1 Nah, I'm just saying that comparitively speaking, these guys don't annoy me as much as some of the others.
[4:04:17] <arkv01> yeah I just couldn't
[4:04:19] <zenith0111> @aflyingtaco1 So wait these are the "good" characters then? NotLikeThis
[4:04:24] <zenith0111> Oh gof
[4:04:34] <$KeroKamina> @arkv01 but all the ANIME is only in the storymode
[4:04:44] <WanderingSwordsman> there are still more characters
[4:04:46] <AFlyingTaco1> @zaphire_saucypants Oh okay, gotcha
[4:04:55] <arkv01> are you trying to tell me the DLC apple actually falls far from the tree
[4:04:57] <+CharredChord> is this game aright if you mute the voices?
[4:05:06] <DesuDesuDokiDoki> damn SCRAPHEADS
[4:05:09] <+Havictos> With dumb most of this writing is maybe it flows better in Japanese. Then again I could be completely wrong and it's dumb there too.
[4:05:12] <KazMkII> Is that even that strange?
[4:05:17] <Heyestus> Are you talking to a game, Pat?
[4:05:17] <+Havictos> with how dumb
[4:05:18] <Zaphire_Saucypants> but god, if there really are even MORE characters....startin to get a bit bloated already.
[4:05:21] <%doc_ock_rokc> Sacred MOON?
[4:05:22] <+socialistOtter> I mean, I'd talk to the robots
[4:05:23] <+Sindellah> How did Pat get controller working? I've had top play with M&K.
[4:05:24] <AFlyingTaco1> @zenith0111 Ye. 90% of all the other characters are just pure fucking stereotype garbage.
[4:05:25] <Saltmeisterr> fucking TOASTERS
[4:05:27] <$KeroKamina> @arkv01 they added a shit ton more to the multiplayer for free and there hasn't been any storymode DLC at all
[4:05:34] <Rangenade> gameplay is great , can reach ACFA speeds if you bother to learn the mechanics and controls
[4:05:42] <+socialistOtter> the robots are more likely to be sympathetic characters than the humans in this game
[4:05:53] <$KeroKamina> you can fly as an outer now in the game
[4:05:56] <%cureneckbeard> emlo psaWink
[4:06:03] <KazMkII> dont forget BOOST WINGS pat
[4:06:06] <arkv01> I'll check out a few youtube videos, the multiplayer additions sound cool
[4:06:07] <+LegendaryDorkKnight> !uptime
[4:06:07] <@Moobot> I've been playing this game for how long? Oh only 4h 6m.
[4:06:07] <+Havictos> Gameplay looks really solid though
[4:06:20] <shazbot2019> man I forgot Outers grunted. I muted mine ASAP in the lab.
[4:06:24] <%Merhabi> yeah controller support was fucky for me too
[4:06:26] <$KeroKamina> good luck with that, there's not alot of videos abotu the updates online
[4:06:36] <zenith0111> The music is cool but it's totally not matching the pace of the gameplay
[4:06:37] <%Merhabi> i had to use a xbox controller or ds4windows
[4:06:44] <Saltmeisterr> theres also a bunch of crossover stuff too
[4:06:51] <+Sindellah> I've got DS4 windows, but this game don't like it.
[4:06:53] <DesuDesuDokiDoki> hi
[4:06:53] <%Laecerelius> Machineguns are always useful to have on hand
[4:06:55] <%Merhabi> and then make sure not to touch the keyboard or mouse while you boot
[4:06:56] <Zarkith> Helll yeah second Gillingr imaChamp
[4:06:57] <KazMkII> New Bazooka
[4:07:02] <startstoprepeat> gp02 incoming
[4:07:08] <KazMkII> Now you can dual weild bazookas
[4:07:10] <arkv01> or install the official sony dualshock drivers for windows
[4:07:18] <doggieo> Switch Pro controller works too
[4:07:24] <%GarbageNirvana> What about stuff not on Steam
[4:07:25] <+jiggy_snipe> steam has built controller support
[4:07:26] <$KeroKamina> i jsutp lugged in my PS4 controller
[4:07:27] <%TheSniperJoe> I just unlocked Funnels, I never once ran into them during my Switch playthrough...
[4:07:32] <+DiabloDeAzul> or just get a 360 pad, you can get a knockoff for $15 on amazon
[4:07:34] <$KeroKamina> withotu installign stuff
[4:07:47] <+necrocannibal2> plus the 360 pad is great
[4:07:49] <$KeroKamina> GO UP
[4:07:50] <DesuDesuDokiDoki> very
[4:07:52] <%Taisuru> Paige Blind
[4:07:53] <%doc_ock_rokc> Vrty
[4:07:54] <%Laecerelius> Dig up?
[4:08:01] <%doc_ock_rokc> Dig Up sutpid
[4:08:06] <%spiritofmojave> wouldnt say useless, i emulated to replay P3/Nier and it's pretty handy
[4:08:06] <hntronium> kinda blind
[4:08:10] <%axellogic> the newer github ds4 is super good though
[4:08:12] <$KeroKamina> YOUTH OF THIS TOWN, AIM FOR THE SURFACE
[4:08:15] <%doc_ock_rokc> Oh no I am now the sutpid
[4:08:18] <+DiabloDeAzul> only major flaw of the 360 controller is that the dpad sucks, but you can mod it
[4:08:18] <%Monkeyweed21> Pat has a terminal case of not looking up
[4:08:30] <+socialistOtter> wait, didn't they say these were RAILWAY tunnels?

[4:10:56] <WanderingSwordsman> don't ask just press buttons
[4:10:59] <%maskofmichael> It's Anime
[4:10:59] <%doc_ock_rokc> Sold their soul to the techno devels
[4:11:04] <$KeroKamina> @Shadowpint it gets super dumb dependign on the endign you get
[4:11:04] <Magmalefilme> the world is imperfect
[4:11:07] <Heyestus> So this is one of those Skip every cutscene games, huh.
[4:11:11] <$KeroKamina> still love it tho
[4:11:13] <+socialistOtter> FLAMETHROWER
[4:11:14] <%Laecerelius> Sneaky
[4:11:17] <$KeroKamina> in that so bad it's good way
[4:11:21] <zenith0111> This is why parents think anime corrupts the youth NotLikeThis
[4:11:22] <+liquidzr0> @DiabloDeAzul i have it on switch but have bben contemplating on getting it for PC
[4:11:23] <Animorphimagi> DESTROY
[4:11:24] <AFlyingTaco1> We've been introduced to about 20 characters by now, and only 3 of them are even halfway decent.
[4:11:27] <%doc_ock_rokc> You think it would be digital hell but really its an endless rave
[4:11:28] <+liquidzr0> *been
[4:11:39] <%Laecerelius> SPEEN!
[4:11:47] <KazMkII> Dont forget BOOST ARMS FOR BETTER DAMAGE
[4:11:52] <arkv01> I think the other reason I'm salty about this game is cause it fucking killed my joycon sticks
[4:11:54] <Zaphire_Saucypants> We've been introduced to TOO MANY characters. It's character overload at this point. Complete Character Saturation levels here.
[4:12:00] <AFlyingTaco1> Don't forget about your Stand, Pat
[4:12:10] <+Shadowpint> And all of the characters suck
[4:12:22] <$KeroKamina> @AFlyingTaco1 10 of the 20 characters actually get character developement and 5 of those 10 would be considered likable
[4:12:25] <zenith0111> @arkv01 Joycon sticks have been notorious for dying
[4:12:30] <arkv01> maybe if the characters actually had s links
[4:12:33] <KazMkII> @PatStaresAt Focus down one at a time
[4:12:57] <%Sasquatch_John> Sasquatch_John subscribed at Tier 1. They've subscribed for 10 months! Greetings he who is spherical, I have been loving the insane tangents on the podcast lately, that shit has had me wheeze laughing to the point that somebody came down to check on me 'cause they thought I was dying, keep it up!
[4:12:58] <DesuDesuDokiDoki> Lemme guess, you have to win in the game and then lose in a cut scene.
[4:13:05] <%doc_ock_rokc> Use DEFENSE FEMTO
[4:13:22] <+answer42jp> Pat got the flamethrower, should he go for the secret demon sword?
[4:13:22] <zenith0111> There's no lock on button?

[4:14:15] <Saltmeisterr> 4Head
[4:14:21] <+socialistOtter> you'd have VIDEO
[4:14:22] <Rangenade> No lock on but it has auto targeting
[4:14:24] <%GarbageNirvana> Everyone fight everyone else for no reason
[4:14:24] <bluefooddye1> You need to update your ffucking firewalls
[4:14:25] <AFlyingTaco1> So the mechs don't even have fucking recording devices in them?
[4:14:29] <zenith0111> BULLETHOLES DON'T LIE
[4:14:32] <+YakumoYomi> BAKA DATA!
[4:14:32] <+necrocannibal2> isn't this a fucking battlefield?

[4:16:27] <VJdarkworld> yall remember when woolie played the demo of this and talked about porn
[4:16:32] <KazMkII> Dont forget to test it
[4:16:34] <%cvp5127> per second
[4:16:35] <%Laecerelius> test it
[4:16:38] <Zarkith> Flames also damage Stamina
[4:16:39] <startstoprepeat> big fire rate
[4:16:40] <KazMkII> DAMAGE OVER TIME
[4:16:40] <%doc_ock_rokc> FlamminWaffin it waffins flammin
[4:16:41] <%NeroInfinite> perseocnd pat
[4:16:43] <+answer42jp> Test the katana
[4:16:45] <zenith0111> EVIL ROBOT MAGIC
[4:16:47] <+YakumoYomi> Flamethrower drains stamina from enemy pilots, so they can't dash.
[4:16:47] <$KeroKamina> @AFlyingTaco1 it hasn't even gone maximum stupid yet, trust me
[4:16:49] <+socialistOtter> test it
[4:16:55] <Animorphimagi> Elder Gods start now?/?/?
[4:16:59] <KazMkII> Test them
[4:16:59] <xeros720> per hit pat, but it's fire
[4:16:59] <%doc_ock_rokc> @PatStaresAt Its Dot
[4:17:01] <%spiritofmojave> It's a DOT cause flame
[4:17:05] <Apollo1818> Flamethrower is real good against arsenals
[4:17:09] <%Monkeyweed21> TRY DUAL WIELD
[4:17:18] <%Laecerelius> Katana Man!
[4:17:25] <%doc_ock_rokc> You didn't try out that MOon thing
[4:17:25] <zenith0111> Unleash your inner parking lot!
[4:17:50] <%Monkeyweed21> RIGHT THERE
[4:18:01] <+answer42jp> Flamethrower is great for unlocking the secret sword
[4:18:07] <%doc_ock_rokc> no
[4:18:08] <%worldbrand> oh no
[4:18:11] <Zarkith> ! PAIGE AT RISK !
[4:18:11] <%D3rrtyD4n> PAIGE DOWN
[4:18:13] <+necrocannibal2> paaaaat
[4:18:15] <Axle13j> lul
[4:18:18] <%SvenHolgersson> PAIGE AT RISK
[4:18:20] <DesuDesuDokiDoki> SUN IS DOWN
[4:18:21] <Zaphire_Saucypants> flame on
[4:18:25] <%Jack_of_No_Trades> Hope she is okay
[4:18:27] <+YakumoYomi> HELP THE MUSTARD QUEEN!!!
[4:18:37] <%Jack_of_No_Trades> stubbing toe at midnight stinks
[4:18:38] <startstoprepeat> get right up against it for max damage
[4:18:44] <%SvenHolgersson> Patrick stop playing your video games and help out your sister
[4:18:47] <+socialistOtter> it removes stamina IMMEDIATELY
[4:18:53] <+ArtemisCroc> it's literally the only viable way
[4:18:57] <+ArtemisCroc> you need 2 flamethrowers
[4:19:01] <KazMkII> It's good for defensive measure
[4:19:05] <hntronium> It drains enemy stamina
[4:19:10] <%Laecerelius> So it's good against enemy pilots but not randos
[4:19:17] <%Monkeyweed21> it stops mechs from boosting
[4:19:25] <%doc_ock_rokc> Side arm to fuck up melee
[4:19:32] <xeros720> yeah
[4:19:34] <Apollo1818> @patstaresat It’s great against arsenals since it drains stamina. It pairs well with the stun-locking rocket launchers
[4:19:46] <+answer42jp> The flamethrower breaks a specific gargoyle in an earlier mission that has a demon sword in it
[4:19:54] <Zarkith> You have to break a statue that has INSANE defense for the secret weapon. Flamethrower is the best for it because of how many individual hits it deals.
[4:20:07] <@SSaryn> Oh jesus fuck I just came in to see what was up and I see a fucking wall of BULLSHIT
[4:20:31] <KazMkII> Try Garuda
[4:20:35] <%Punchasaur> aight i just said fuck it and bought the game
[4:20:47] <AFlyingTaco1> @ssaryn Just wait until we get to the dialogue
[4:20:49] <startstoprepeat> garuda is autofire instead of a burst
[4:21:17] <+D00msDayDan> garuda is for dumping ass
[4:21:26] <$KeroKamina> @Punchasaur you won't regret it
[4:21:30] <$KeroKamina> maybe
[4:21:47] <%demegodz> Im back, are you winning, pat?
[4:21:48] <Rangenade> red damage = optimal range // white damage = outside optimal range
[4:22:06] <%Oxybe> I'm seeing shoulder rockets. so big question: Can we Itano Circus?
[4:22:11] <@SSaryn> oh.
[4:22:12] <CptVolkow> elmo
[4:22:18] <hntronium> It is
[4:22:21] <+D00msDayDan> @Oxybe there's a goddamn vector cannon so probably

[4:22:28] <$KeroKamina> @demegodz did you miss when an eldritch god was piloting an edgelord mech?
[4:22:31] <OldManJEWc> this is starting to look like virtual on
[4:22:35] <+HollowMan190> did they make controlling the person of foot feel any better?
[4:22:36] <$KeroKamina> @Pomer steam versio ncame out today
[4:22:45] <%Oxybe> @d00msdaydan psaGib psaGib psaGib
[4:22:46] <+Pomer> FUCK I JUST BOUGHT GRANBLUE MAN MY WALLET
[4:22:59] <KazMkII> I think only certain weapon types have Optimal ranges
[4:23:03] <CptVolkow> rip that dudes wallet
[4:23:16] <+Pomer> @CptVolkow :c
[4:23:17] <Saltmeisterr> f for wallet
[4:23:22] <CptVolkow> f
[4:23:23] <Rangenade> you can check that stat in the equipment menu and check it with the ingame distance meter
[4:23:26] <hntronium> F
[4:23:30] <%Maids4lyfe> f
[4:23:31] <%luftraumm1> f
[4:23:39] <+necrocannibal2> granblue sucks
[4:23:39] <Zedimonx5> This looks like it should have been a gundam game...
[4:23:40] <%demegodz> @KeroKamina I suppose I did
[4:23:40] <SkyPirateArcane> f
[4:23:48] <KazMkII> Dont forget to Save your game
[4:23:49] <%Laecerelius> babby legs just like Pat

[4:23:54] <%demegodz> Guess I need to catch up on the vod after this
[4:24:07] <arkv01> equip inafune-san
[4:24:19] <$KeroKamina> unequip inafune san
[4:24:23] <$KeroKamina> get him away fro mmy robots

[4:24:38] <Saltmeisterr> dude ive been doing f's in chat all day
[4:24:41] <Saltmeisterr> its great
[4:24:46] <%Jekado> press X if you want more stats
[4:24:46] <%Pomer> Pomer subscribed with Twitch Prime. 
[4:24:47] <startstoprepeat> there's some nice legs you can get from that car protection mission that increase your ground boost speed, i just got those and they're fun
[4:24:47] <Rangenade> better fire rate support = better fire rate , more effective on slower firing weapons
[4:24:52] <Zedimonx5> Oh shit you can make a mismatched junker
[4:24:54] <%KnivesEve> is this gonna be a thing or just a one off?
[4:24:56] <CptVolkow> X
[4:25:01] <$KeroKamina> i hope you stream this game more after the RE marathon
[4:25:13] <Sinaqui> So is this the new hotness to take Armored Core's place since Fromsoft is busy with Souls?
[4:25:28] <captain_rockbear> memory up
[4:25:34] <Zarkith> Memory Up is your best friend
[4:25:35] <Zaphire_Saucypants> just short of 70k at this point
[4:25:35] <KazMkII> Depends on what kinda Build you want
[4:25:35] <arkv01> the multiplayers fine, but it suffers from the same issues armored core multiplayer has
[4:25:36] <jcflyguy> Memory or boost
[4:25:45] <KazMkII> Memory or BOOST is best
[4:25:47] <Zaphire_Saucypants> what about your chain upgrade?
[4:25:47] <@SSaryn> I'm assuming Boost is pretty rad.
[4:25:48] <startstoprepeat> i took firing up and didn't notice much of a difference
[4:25:50] <%cowardlord> Buy the sword combo upgrade
[4:25:50] <arkv01> it settles into top tier shit and thats it
[4:25:55] <$KeroKamina> Memory Up & Boost Up
[4:25:57] <%Laecerelius> Geno BOOOOOOST!
[4:26:03] <DesuDesuDokiDoki> BOOSTO BOOSTO BOOSTO
[4:26:05] <Rangenade> boost is pretty fun
[4:26:10] <%ahdurian> sure lets go with t hat
[4:26:11] <captain_rockbear> yeah
[4:26:19] <jcflyguy> Basically yes
[4:26:21] <%Laecerelius> Seems like it's just a 3% boost
[4:26:26] <xeros720> what, 3%?
[4:26:27] <%ahdurian> oh well
[4:26:27] <%Pomer> @Sinaqui i assume since it's performance is no longer shackled by the switch hardware (performance having been a huge complaint on that platform) and Mechwarrior 5 being kinda booty that it's got a lot of eyes on it.
[4:26:32] <%Merhabi> oh no
[4:26:33] <%D3rrtyD4n> psaWhat
[4:26:35] <%SwdVengeance> 3% Optimization
[4:26:36] <jcflyguy> Derp
[4:26:38] <arkv01> if pat plays any more of the story mode he's just going to shave years off his life
[4:26:39] <%D3rrtyD4n> ok good
[4:26:40] <xeros720> equip it
[4:26:54] <%heartlesshealer> dang
[4:27:00] <+Kurvera> did you save?
[4:27:02] <KazMkII> @PatStaresAt When are you gonna stream this again?
[4:27:09] <$KeroKamina> i love how stupid the story gets
[4:27:11] <DesuDesuDokiDoki> night
[4:27:16] <%Jekado> i think i auto saves
[4:27:17] <hntronium> Honestly, I dig the story but not the english voices
[4:27:18] <$KeroKamina> especially later
[4:27:18] <Sinaqui> @Pomer Well, Mechwarrior has always felt way different, to me, compared to AC. Like AC was a fast and loose game, and Mechwarrior was a slow and ponderous one? Been forever since I played MW tho
[4:27:20] <arkv01> yeah i can tell, but most of us just die in general
[4:27:25] <%Jekado> because i can't find a save option
[4:27:50] <hntronium> I'm fairly sure I've seen pat manually saving earlier
[4:27:52] <+shaidot> !uptime
[4:27:53] <@Moobot> I've been playing this game for how long? Oh only 4h 27m.
[4:27:58] <$KeroKamina> @hntronium you can tell that the dub was done on a budget, but once oyu get past that the game's pretty enjoyable
[4:28:10] <%Jekado> just play in japanese
[4:28:17] <hntronium> I'll keep to my weebanese dubs thank you very much
[4:28:31] <%Jekado> thats not very oppai of you
[4:28:32] <$KeroKamina> well that is hte one with the more mecha references
[4:28:42] <collind99> Is the stream done?
[4:28:43] <%Pomer> @Sinaqui i suppose MW and AC have always been the OG big two for real steel mecha games, so while it's not a fair comparison mechanic-wise it's sadly an apt market comparison. Especially with MW5's epic exclusivity and the PR bombing that comes with that.
[4:28:46] <%heartlesshealer> you all have a good evening, heading out a bit early for friend stuff
[4:28:57] <$KeroKamina> Four saying "Yes MY Lord" to savior i'm pretty sure is a reference to the fact she's CC from code geass
[4:29:00] <$KeroKamina> i think
[4:29:07] <collind99> Lol did I join just as it ended
[4:29:11] <%Jekado> yeah MW is more realistic american mechs. AC is more "anime" super fast mechs kinda like virtual on
[4:29:12] <$KeroKamina> kinda
[4:29:14] <collind99> Oof
[4:29:14] <+LTKonnor> !uptime
[4:29:14] <@Moobot> I've been playing this game for how long? Oh only 4h 29m.
[4:29:51] <$KeroKamina> @collind99 tTL,DW, patl ikes the game, it's a reallly good armored core sucessor, but also it gets really A N I ME at times
[4:29:52] <Sinaqui> @Pomer Fair dues. It's not like Front Mission managed to crack the action game scene, after all. Instead, it became an IP for everyone to point at in confusion
[4:29:59] <%cowardlord> Pat went pee poops
[4:30:00] <%cureneckbeard> psaHoldon
[4:30:15] <%Pomer> @Sinaqui and now i'm sad about front mission. again.
[4:30:18] <collind99> Anyone else like the new batsuit?
[4:30:28] <hntronium> Eh, better off ANIME than whatever comes out of the opposite
[4:30:29] <Zaphire_Saucypants> new batsuit?
[4:30:34] <trashcansan> @collind99 you mean the new daredevil costume?
[4:30:37] <collind99> It has Arkham Knight vibes mixed with the OV batsuit design
[4:30:40] <$KeroKamina> robert pattinson has a fucking JAWLINE
[4:30:41] <Sinaqui> @Pomer We can all only be sad about Front Mission. 3 will forever be the highlight of the series
[4:30:42] <hntronium> What is the opposite western equivalent anyway?

[4:31:51] <%Oxybe> ye
[4:31:51] <captain_rockbear> yea
[4:31:51] <%mh9s> i had an acceptable amount of funs
[4:31:52] <ClairvoyantNara> yes
[4:31:54] <@SSaryn> Mechs are cool
[4:31:54] <hntronium> I'll probably buy this game
[4:31:55] <%cureneckbeard> tanoshii
[4:31:55] <%Konquerer> a little
[4:31:58] <Zaphire_Saucypants> huh...batsuit kinda makes me think of a weird mix of Arkham and classic batman. Just a smidge.
[4:31:58] <%ittla> that's some real bad dialog
[4:32:01] <CptVolkow> fun
[4:32:05] <trueherobappo> yea
[4:32:05] <arkv01> inferior, yes
[4:32:06] <King_thunder365> And by no, I mean YES
[4:32:07] <$KeroKamina> for the single player, yes
[4:32:07] <%MoralCompassGaming> just got here, was streaming SaGa Frontier 2
[4:32:10] <King_thunder365> I was just being a shit
[4:32:12] <+twohitgood> yes. "fun".
[4:32:14] <Saltmeisterr> ye we had anime mecha
[4:32:15] <%spiritofmojave> this plot gets in the way of the good mech shit
[4:32:16] <KazMkII> Yeah, that's the game and you choose your Build
[4:32:17] <%ShichiNoBushi> What else is this on?
[4:32:17] <WanderingSwordsman> pretty much
[4:32:18] <%linkster291> Pretty much.
[4:32:18] <%Jekado> robot ace combat
[4:32:19] <jcflyguy> Ignore the story and you're good
[4:32:22] <+twohitgood> i had "fun" today. "sure".
[4:32:23] <trashcansan> but ace combat was cooler
[4:32:25] <%vectorless_peon> yea
[4:32:25] <+Shadowpint> This game is a 5/10 at best IMO
[4:32:26] <%linkster291> You get a lot more parts.
[4:32:26] <$KeroKamina> @ShichiNoBushi Switch and Steam
[4:32:29] <%SwdVengeance> Armored Core is literally just Mech Ace Combat
[4:32:30] <arkv01> you have to salvage or craft everything
[4:32:31] <%Pomer> oh shit i need to replay AC7 again.
[4:32:35] <%DEETRz> would you recommend this game on steam at full price or wait for a sale?
[4:32:37] <%cowardlord> I agree
[4:32:38] <%vectorless_peon> it gets bullshit near the end though
[4:32:39] <%Pomer> jpeg dog best girl.
[4:32:42] <Zaphire_Saucypants> ace combat had better voice acting
[4:32:47] <%SirGO0SE> psaJpeg
[4:32:48] <+Mottyrob> Keyboard and mouse is actually good in this
[4:32:49] <%D3rrtyD4n> psaJpeg
[4:32:52] <WanderingSwordsman> the story is enjoyable if you like crap
[4:32:52] <%spiritofmojave> Ace Combat for sure, even the plots more engaging
[4:32:52] <%Lizard0TM> psaJpeg psaJpeg psaJpeg psaJpeg
[4:32:52] <+zetaplus> ace combat at least has likeable characters
[4:32:53] <arkv01> yep
[4:32:56] <%MSN04_Sazabi> psaJpeg
[4:32:56] <KazMkII> They arent that similar pat. . .
[4:32:57] <%MoralCompassGaming> psaJpeg psaJpeg psaJpeg psaJpeg
[4:32:58] <%miguelrod777> psaJpeg
[4:32:58] <%vectorless_peon> Ace Combat is better
[4:32:58] <%cowardlord> psaJpeg psaJpeg psaJpeg
[4:32:58] <%Taisuru> PLAY THE DLC
[4:32:59] <+D00msDayDan> i wish the dialogue and voice acting and music and presentation were as good as ace combat's
[4:33:00] <%D3rrtyD4n> PogChamp
[4:33:02] <Sinaqui> Ace Combat as a series has always had a good baseline of gamefeel
[4:33:02] <jcflyguy> Yeah but AC isn't anime
[4:33:02] <%SwdVengeance> PLAY AC7 DLC
[4:33:03] <%Futurecity10> Play the dlc
[4:33:03] <arkv01> cause AC7 has a pretty good story?
[4:33:04] <%ShichiNoBushi> @KeroKamina Not on PS4? I have a Switch, but from what I heard in this stream it's inferior.
[4:33:05] <%spiritofmojave> YEAH
[4:33:05] <%mh9s> psaJpeg
[4:33:06] <+D00msDayDan> YEAH PLAY THE DLC
[4:33:07] <%Pomer> oh that's. damning.
[4:33:08] <hntronium> THATS A SOLITARY
[4:33:10] <%Lizard0TM> DO IT
[4:33:10] <Zaphire_Saucypants> yeah
[4:33:11] <%D3rrtyD4n> yes
[4:33:11] <King_thunder365> NO
[4:33:11] <+necrocannibal2> yeah
[4:33:11] <Psyramics> kind of unfair comparison, since DxM was made for Switch and AC7 wasn't
[4:33:13] <trashcansan> psaJpeg
[4:33:13] <%SirGO0SE> more AC7 pls
[4:33:14] <%Lizard0TM> PLAY AC7
[4:33:14] <%spiritofmojave> True DLCs there
[4:33:16] <arkv01> yeah it does, you're hungry for some decent plot
[4:33:16] <%Taisuru> DURING
[4:33:21] <%SwdVengeance> It takes place midway
[4:33:21] <+eanscrale> Some games make you feel ike dat
[4:33:24] <KazMkII> AIR PLANE =/= Mecha action
[4:33:26] <+D00msDayDan> it's after stonehenge and before farbanti
[4:33:29] <%DrSoulDraig> psaJpeg
[4:33:33] <$KeroKamina> @ShichiNoBushi it was originally a switch exclusive, came out same day as borderlands 3, this is it's second chance at life
[4:33:34] <%Pomer> fuck i gotta go hell with granblue i need to replay AC7
[4:33:35] <%Taisuru> It's part of the story
[4:33:38] <%SwdVengeance> It's a self contained side mission set
[4:33:41] <+twohitgood> i'm not sure they're in the same genre. ace combat is a different kind of aerial combat.
[4:33:42] <%Taisuru> Yes you just pick the missions
[4:33:47] <+D00msDayDan> yeah it's a different thing in the menu
[4:33:48] <%vectorless_peon> Ace Combat 7 is much higher quality overall then Deamon, i have both games yes the dlc is sepereate from the base game
[4:33:55] <%SwdVengeance> Totally self contained
[4:33:57] <%Taisuru> You don't need to replay the story they are their own menu
[4:34:03] <arkv01> oooh cool, new story dlc
[4:34:05] <%Pomer> OH I CAN BUY AC7 ON THE PC IT GOES HELLA CHEAP NOW

[4:35:19] <%Neo_Kaiser> Is Pat gonna play Dawn of Fear because it's a RE1 clone that looks jank?
[4:35:20] <Sinaqui> I'm sure in four months some speedrunner will have found a way to execute arbitrary code to overflow points to the maximum value
[4:35:21] <%Lizard0TM> LUL
[4:35:21] <%SvenHolgersson> C O W A R D
[4:35:22] <KazMkII> @PatStaresAt So will you play Daemon X Machina again?

[4:35:34] <trashcansan> LUL
[4:35:35] <%cowardlord> Gotta suck it up
[4:35:35] <KazMkII> Aww
[4:35:37] <%Lizard0TM> LUL LUL LUL thinks hacks will get him banned
[4:35:38] <%D3rrtyD4n> yeah that story was real bad
[4:35:40] <%SvenHolgersson> rip
[4:35:42] <%MSN04_Sazabi> Oof
[4:35:43] <hntronium> F anime mechs
[4:35:43] <arkv01> yeah I don't blame you
[4:35:45] <Zaphire_Saucypants> had a feelin
[4:35:49] <hntronium> I love it
[4:35:52] <%D3rrtyD4n> it hurts the game
[4:35:53] <trashcansan> that story was wrecking me
[4:35:56] <%Jekado> i'm surpised he played it in the first play
[4:35:58] <Zaphire_Saucypants> it's bad and kinda bland for me.
[4:35:59] <Sinaqui> Go play a mech game with no story, like Master of Arena
[4:36:00] <%Jekado> place
[4:36:00] <%spiritofmojave> Sadly yeah
[4:36:01] <Hydrapissed> monkaS
[4:36:01] <%SirGO0SE> and it's playing over the rad music
[4:36:07] <KazMkII> @PatStaresAt It's honestly not much worse than Ace Combat "story"
[4:36:07] <+necrocannibal2> it wouldn't be so bad if the character didn't shut the fuck up
[4:36:08] <doggieo> But you didnt get to the terrible parts
[4:36:09] <+A0N33> The story is really bad, but it feels like it's the best mech game to come out since Titanfall 2
[4:36:11] <%Neo_Kaiser> What do you want from a mech game?
[4:36:12] <arkv01> pat I played it for like 40-50 hours expecting it to get better after every mission
[4:36:12] <G03933> LUL yea, i was gonna ask "is there a mod to skip all the dialog?"
[4:36:13] <Hydrapissed> mute the voices?
[4:36:18] <%vectorless_peon> the story of deamon goes from bad to worse
[4:36:24] <arkv01> only for it to drop off a fucking cliff at the end
[4:36:25] <+m3chamike> 100 percent agree pat
[4:36:27] <%miguelrod777> psaJpeg
[4:36:27] <Zaphire_Saucypants> Fuckin phenomenal. More interesting characters.

[4:36:33] <hntronium> I'd rather not listen to the english dubs though
[4:36:35] <$R3Roundabout> I played the game on mute and listened to old SuperBestFriendCasts
[4:36:38] <MicrotonalMatt> Code Vein is the same way god that story is bad
