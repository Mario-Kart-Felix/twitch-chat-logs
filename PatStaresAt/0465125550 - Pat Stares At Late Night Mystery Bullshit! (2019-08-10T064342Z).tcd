[0:07:20] <$Brother_Coduss> @Ryan1016 pretty much yeah. every schlooter is literally just the same as every other one. shitty multiplayer where you do the same damn raids over and over to get shitty gear that's slightly better than the shitty gear you already own to make arbitrary numbers go up
[0:07:21] <soraabora> its still friday on the west coast
[0:07:21] <Goldenwolf98> Big problems you have
[0:07:22] <%Jay_Squirrel> the patch will be on Tuesday and it reduces the number of eaz mini-bosses required from 100 to 50. Wii final bosses of the EAZ will be worth multiple minibosses @angriestpat

[0:16:45] <%psychodave1234> theft is a victimless crime like littering
[0:16:45] <%TaifuDragon> The bar I work at uses biodegradable plastic, it's a good mix
[0:16:46] <%ElenaManetta> Who needs a STRAW
[0:16:47] <%Kataguro> Strange magic
[0:16:48] <King_Wolf_Rigger> How are you saving the enviroment by killing more trees?
[0:16:48] <eiightbiitt> sup smallest angriest ginger man
[0:16:49] <%Hobojo153> You're welcome for that sound clip internet
[0:16:50] <%hussdogrob> the problem is that I chew on my straws, screwing my teeth up on the hard metal
[0:16:50] <IndoorSitup> STRAWS ARE FUCKEN DUMB ANYWAY

[0:16:57] <dabeaminator> Just don't use a straw you manchild.
[0:16:57] <tigerfang86> IMAGINE USING STRAWS
[0:17:02] <IndoorSitup> STRAWS ARE FOR WEAKLINGS
[0:17:04] <joedatuous> pat smell

[0:17:08] <%hussdogrob> @justinianknight habit
[0:17:09] <King_Wolf_Rigger> Here's a fucking idea, quit being a bitch, and drink without straws
[0:17:09] <%Keyd00d> carefull there
[0:17:10] <%RubberFistFight> @AngriestPat here's a new fear for you - if you trip while using a metal straw, you might land badly, drive it through the back of your mouth and give yourself an impromptu brainstem biopsy. Enjoy your metal straw :P
[0:17:11] <feelgooddrag0ndragoon> THE MAD LAD

[0:17:17] <%SaintPyre> Pat, what the Fuck it’s 3:00am why am I watching this
[0:17:18] <cgame_me811> LUL
[0:17:20] <%doc_ock_rokc> @AngriestPat Fun fact: you can't recycle Paper straws, So they are a net worth worse for the environment then plastic ones
[0:17:22] <%Kazooki_Kazami> metal > sillicone >>>> plastic for straw rankings
[0:17:23] <$ESP_ROOT> dude im STILL in heaavensward
[0:17:28] <%Schrodingers_Box> @angriestpat Paper straws are contaminated by drinks so most places don't recycle them, on top of turning to mush. You can actually make plastic ones out of plant fibres that you can recycle and degrade.
[0:17:31] <+Ryan1016> FIGHT IT PAT

[0:18:15] <DocMadfox> @ElenaManetta My MS makes it so I get sick easier and I don't trust minimum wage workers to give enough of a fuck to actually clean the glass half decently. So I'll stick with the straw.
[0:18:18] <@lewdskeletor13> Pat don’t fall asleep now, you’ll instantly be banned
[0:18:21] <DesuDesuDokiDoki> FUCK THE EARTH
[0:18:21] <%doc_ock_rokc> You can't recycle any paper that touches food matter
[0:18:22] <%Hobojo153> LUL
[0:18:22] <The_Introspector> So paper straws are worse than plastic ones, huuuuuuh?
[0:18:22] <%TheMattman1313> It's not about recycling so much as it is that they fall apart before stabbing turtles
[0:18:23] <%TaifuDragon> Just use biodegradable plastic ones, even if they get dumped they'll not stick around very long
[0:18:24] <%BallerSwagBro9k> Yes theyre worse
[0:18:33] <goroke> pat just stream later!
[0:18:34] <%psychodave1234> a lot better honestly

[0:18:40] <%SirGO0SE> straws are actually all bad for you because the suction is unnatural for the human body or some shit but god will i never care
[0:18:40] <%axellogic> You need to clean the wings with some strong cleaner
[0:18:41] <$afronooch> its p. good
[0:18:41] <eiightbiitt> is Destiny 2 Free to play yet?

[0:19:00] <%hussdogrob> hey @angriestpat Why are you yawning? is it because your body wants to sleep cause it's 3am?
[0:19:01] <%doc_ock_rokc> @TaifuDragon There are disadvantages to them. They can desolve in some envornments as well and have a short shelf life

[0:31:19] <%SirGO0SE> BETTER DEVILS FOR LIFE
[0:31:20] <$Bison_Says_YES> Big Cheats for big boys
[0:31:22] <%Piemen99> theres better now
[0:31:22] <%ThePuddingDead> yep
[0:31:23] <%Reaped_Psyche> The aim assist is extreme, but mouse and keyboard has no such thing as recoil.
[0:31:25] <%Roasted_Pheasant> And we all know pat loves cheating
[0:31:26] <%GummiBunnies> LUL
[0:31:27] <+Foobe> no, there is absolutely aim assist.
[0:31:28] <%realm_forge> It’s ok
[0:31:28] <$afronooch> @Fynale there's still aim assist on PC
[0:31:29] <%dekkitout> There's something also called bullet magnetism along to aim assist
[0:31:32] <IntrepidEye> Telesto is still popular I see
[0:31:34] <KingKZ> This is the Avatar of videogames: it's a worse version of something that already exists.
[0:31:35] <+Ryan1016> @Fynale There is aim assist on pc for controllers
[0:31:41] <+Fynale> i've always been told there wasn't
[0:31:42] <%dekkitout> M&k gets just bullet magnetism
[0:31:42] <JamboLovePanda> there's a good amount of aim assist when you use a controller
[0:31:49] <MasterDecoder> @AngriestPat Work toward getting the Trust Hand Cannon from Gambit, it's super good
[0:31:52] <MegaFangKing23> You gotta out cheat the cheaters Pat!
[0:31:54] <Malziel> It's really not, not anymore LUL
[0:31:57] <%Jay_Squirrel> hardlight sux
[0:31:58] <$valriot> @angriestpat There's a new Better Devils called Service Revolver now, it's fuckin great
[0:31:59] <%Hobojo153> It's like those Halo 4 guns, but good
[0:32:00] <+Fynale> @AngriestPat hold reload on the hard light to change elements
[0:32:00] <GrayMatterNZ> Not anymore
[0:32:01] <Malziel> Autos got shat on
[0:32:01] <+Lost_Echo> Plus, hand cannons have a lot of magnetism don't they?
[0:32:12] <$Bison_Says_YES> i dont remember the Gun models being so Huge monkaS
[0:32:13] <MegaFangKing23> Nooooo
[0:32:17] <Neo_Kaiser> Aim assist or bullet magnetism?
[0:32:28] <%dekkitout> There's a sniper that can do that too
[0:32:31] <%mastertwin2> Hand cannons still have the bloom thing, right?
[0:32:32] <JamboLovePanda> pat should do the mountaintop quest....
[0:32:36] <+d00msdaydan> bungie's always juiced their aim assist to make the shooting feel better, even kbm has tons of bullet magnetism
[0:32:41] <%realm_forge> And cannons and pulse rifles are the current PvP meta
[0:32:41] <+Ryan1016> @mastertwin2 Not much bloom on pc
[0:32:42] <%Hobojo153> Didn't you used to have to go into the menu to do that?
[0:32:45] <Ion_Laser> I fucking loved Hard Light in D1
[0:32:45] <%Reaped_Psyche> The Trust hand cannon is great. All you have to do is do gambit a bunch and it'll drop eventually.
[0:32:46] <KingKZ> Baby Mode?
[0:32:51] <+Foobe> Hard Light, if you weren't already told, has a set damage from any range, with the only major downside being recoil
[0:32:51] <+cahv123> Bullet magnatism?
[0:32:55] <IntrepidEye> I don't think the aim assist is too bad. Bullet magnetism can be pretty crazy though. I see it a lot from mainly using scout rifles and hitting shots I know i missed
[0:33:01] <+Fynale> @AngriestPat btw the sniper rifle that can change elements(the borealis) is now on pc as it used to be a ps4 exclusive for 2 years
[0:33:05] <dabeaminator> Will you or Woolie stream P5R now that Atlus has let up on the streaming restrictions?
[0:33:06] <%Roasted_Pheasant> FOURTH PLACE? MORE LIKE 3RD LOSER. KICK SOME ASS BOYO!
[0:33:07] <%dekkitout> What's cool about hard light is that the bounced bullets do more damage
[0:33:09] <+Foobe> tl;dr, it's got fantastic range for an auto
[0:33:11] <%Piemen99> @KingKZ Baby mode apatBig
[0:33:13] <+d00msdaydan> @AngriestPat hard light does bonus damage on ricochet so feel free to spray and pray
[0:33:19] <%ShichiNoBushi> Like Wanted.
[0:33:25] <Geno4344> curving bullets? Like in Wanted?
[0:33:25] <%Roasted_Pheasant> GET BACK IN THERE AND RAISE SOME LUMPS BOY! I WANT A CONFESSION!
[0:33:33] <+Ryan1016> D:
[0:33:33] <eiightbiitt> isnt this a map from the first Destiny?
[0:33:34] <+Fynale> controllers though have no recoil control making some guns useless for them
[0:33:35] <Valdorick> So like Giage's "Close enough" from Borderlands 2?
[0:33:38] <%Titannel> Titannel subscribed with Twitch Prime. 
[0:33:39] <%Hobojo153> apatCrazyhand apatCrazyhead
[0:33:45] <Jodoxk1> It
[0:33:46] <%Roasted_Pheasant> @eiightbiitt ye
[0:33:48] <DesuDesuDokiDoki> lewd
[0:33:48] <%ThePuddingDead> G E T B A C K I N T H E R E
[0:33:54] <+Foobe> thumbsticks
[0:33:54] <Jodoxk1> It's your fault for letting us watch
[0:33:55] <Fruitywhompus> sorry we won't watch u again
[0:33:56] <%Reaped_Psyche> It's not over until Shaxx sings... and he's very shy.
[0:33:57] <Assaultpanda> yes
[0:33:57] <+d00msdaydan> ah yes afk botters, the staple of any rumble match
[0:33:59] <BlueSpartan119> both bumpers yes
[0:33:59] <%Hobojo153> Yeah
[0:34:01] <$afronooch> yep
[0:34:02] <%Piemen99> yeah
[0:34:04] <GrayMatterNZ> yep
[0:34:04] <Stormo> both bumpers yeah
[0:34:05] <RepMetal18> You show those bots who's boss pat
[0:34:05] <Crushter> yes @eiightbiitt it's redesigned
[0:34:06] <%Jay_Squirrel> hit every button till something happens
[0:34:07] <+Ryan1016> @AngriestPat People AFK because of the solstice armor quests to get the games done, that's why you see those dudes doing nothing, super lame
[0:34:07] <%realm_forge> Yup
[0:34:08] <eiightbiitt> thought it looked familiar
[0:34:10] <%wsintai> @AngriestPat "I forget how to super fuck" - Pat 2019
[0:34:14] <$Bison_Says_YES> BM FeelsBadMan
[0:34:15] <IndoorSitup> UNLIMITED POWAAAAAAAA
[0:34:19] <%ElenaManetta> This game makes me really want to play Quake Live.
[0:34:19] <CyborgAV> UNLIMITED POWWAAAA
[0:34:21] <%SirGO0SE> become PALPATINE
[0:34:22] <lloyddboy> you got the idler congrats
[0:34:24] <dabeaminator> This kind of just looks like Halo 5 to me.
[0:34:29] <Copperama> @everyone is there a reason to not wait til this game is free in October?
[0:34:34] <Stormo> but you're a warlock so your supercharge sucks
[0:34:34] <%Roasted_Pheasant> Unlimited Bullets in My Face more like Kappa
[0:34:34] <%dekkitout> Too bad he doesn't have the Kamehameha unlocked
[0:34:36] <KingKZ> Try not getting shot.
[0:34:37] <+bigcomfyman> nope
[0:34:41] <+Fynale> @dabeaminator i mean the ppl who made this made halo soooo
[0:34:45] <%doc_ock_rokc> @dabeaminator its bungi
[0:34:50] <%Roasted_Pheasant> Remember that Halo 5 came out
[0:34:51] <Crushter> Destiny barely resembles halo at all
[0:34:52] <%Titannel> I like it when the boomy shootbangs happen
[0:34:54] <Futurecity10> Halo 5 doesnt exist
[0:34:54] <Ion_Laser> I don't remember Halo 5 having this much color
[0:34:55] <dabeaminator> I know.
[0:34:57] <IntrepidEye> how that aim
[0:35:01] <MasterDecoder> @Copperama Only if you like the pretty Solstice gear(at max)
[0:35:05] <+Ryan1016> @Copperama You'd have to buy forsaken to play that content, but if you just want to play the newest stuff it's fine to wait for Shadowkeep unless you want to grind early
[0:35:09] <dabeaminator> Halo 5 was real bad
[0:35:09] <Cattadope> Oh man remember halo
[0:35:13] <Futurecity10> Halo ended at reach
[0:35:13] <%MonsieurHedge> alright destiny players how do i run up to people and blow them away with a shotgun
[0:35:14] <acecondeuce> Yes
[0:35:15] <Geno4344> yes
[0:35:15] <IndoorSitup> It's not really Bungie tho. More like Zombie Bungie.
[0:35:16] <IntrepidEye> Unfortunately
[0:35:17] <+Fynale> halo 5 had master chief be evil
[0:35:19] <SpaceGuntank> yes, it sucked.
[0:35:20] <%BallerSwagBro9k> It super did Pat
[0:35:20] <%Maids4lyfe> Unfortunately
[0:35:21] <Ion_Laser> yeah it happened
[0:35:21] <$Bison_Says_YES> Halo 5 didn't happen...
[0:35:23] <+Fynale> that's a bow
[0:35:24] <Copperama> k thanks
[0:35:25] <+d00msdaydan> halo 5's campaign was poop but i love the boost dashing
[0:35:28] <%Reaped_Psyche> Bows are sick.
[0:35:28] <$Bison_Says_YES> i refuse to admit it
[0:35:28] <%dekkitout> Bows REALLY hurt
[0:35:30] <dabeaminator> @Futurecity10 Agreed.
[0:35:30] <%BallerSwagBro9k> But it was meh
[0:35:31] <%Reaped_Psyche> FIGHT FOREVER GUARDIAN!
[0:35:32] <maxpasta> Yes and I like it
[0:35:36] <KingKZ> I have no memory of Halo 5 being a thing.
[0:35:39] <Cattadope> Didn’t halo 6 come out? Or was that infinite?
[0:35:39] <Crushter> @AngriestPat bows were added in Forsaken
[0:35:39] <+Fynale> @AngriestPat bows came in forsaken and machine guns came in with black armory
[0:35:43] <Cattadope> Or was I wrong on both?
[0:35:45] <$afronooch> yeah they throw the keys at you
[0:35:46] <Ion_Laser> The lead actor from Luke Cage was the face of the main character in Halo 5
[0:35:48] <+Ryan1016> Yeah gambit strikes and crucible give a lot of keys
[0:35:49] <DracaenaLeaf> All those 0's by two of them
[0:35:54] <acecondeuce> Halo 6 = Halo Infinite
[0:35:57] <%Roasted_Pheasant> @Cattadope Halo 5 came out. Infinite has not yet
[0:35:59] <%ThePuddingDead> look at all this stuff happening
[0:35:59] <%Jay_Squirrel> good job pat you did it
[0:36:00] <dabeaminator> Space Bows?
[0:36:00] <%dekkitout> The game showers you in shit now
[0:36:01] <Cattadope> Oohhhh ok lol
[0:36:04] <+Ryan1016> Keep your solstice armor on
[0:36:04] <%ThePuddingDead> thats a thiiing and those are thiiings
[0:36:04] <Copperama> Do stats matter in PVP matches?
[0:36:06] <%Titannel> I'm not convinced that Destiny's creative director isn't just a high school kid writing cool words in his notebook
[0:36:07] <IndoorSitup> Halo 5 had a shit campaign but the multiplayer is pretty fuckin good.
[0:36:09] <Cattadope> Halo 6 is inifinite is that out?
[0:36:10] <goroke> How the hell does Pat have 25k Bright Dust lol
[0:36:13] <%Reaped_Psyche> New space doll to dress up.
[0:36:15] <dabeaminator> Not yet
[0:36:17] <%nofestu2> its as shiny as ypurs
[0:36:20] <+d00msdaydan> @Cattadope next year
[0:36:21] <%ShichiNoBushi> We all see your shiny head, Pat.
[0:36:21] <%Maids4lyfe> if you want to level the solstice armor you need to keep it on
[0:36:25] <%mastertwin2> no keep the Solstice stuff on
[0:36:26] <Cattadope> Nice
[0:36:26] <%Agami23> didnt halo 5 have a game mode that focused on lootboxs that gave you amped up weapons and vehicles??
[0:36:27] <+Ryan1016> Wait how DOES pat have 25k bright dust
[0:36:30] <$Bison_Says_YES> i just hope Halo Infinite has built in Mixer connectivity Kappa
[0:36:37] <BlueSpartan119> yeah Halo 5 has a good sandbox but the story was a dumpsterfire
[0:36:39] <%Jay_Squirrel> outside of iron banans light level doesnt matter
[0:36:39] <+bigcomfyman> which is why u should do the campaign
[0:36:42] <HUNTERX2X> destiny is destiny
[0:36:45] <%SirGO0SE> do people still use that website i think it was like d2manager?
[0:36:48] <Cattadope> I liked halo back in the day would love to like it again but they’ll have to really pull some magic shit
[0:36:48] <IndoorSitup> @agami23 That's wrong.
[0:36:52] <%SirGO0SE> that was the shit
[0:36:53] <sniffy77> imagine being the person who came up wity the idea of Spartan Locke.
[0:36:55] <$afronooch> only the piece your working on though.
[0:36:58] <IntrepidEye> @Agami23 Yep. Warzone
[0:37:06] <Copperama> "Destiny is Destiny" is Destiny
[0:37:08] <%Reaped_Psyche> Remember that in Crucible light level doesn't matter.
[0:37:08] <+Luna_Ashford> What the fuck Pat, its 3:20am
[0:37:12] <%dekkitout> Yeyeye, Gambino
[0:37:13] <+Fynale> @AngriestPat just do gambit it's dark souls pvp
[0:37:14] <%Roasted_Pheasant> Halo 5 came out. Anthem also came out.
[0:37:17] <seycheles> big patters!
[0:37:17] <+Ryan1016> PvEvP
[0:37:17] <dabeaminator> I ain't buying the Xbox One X One, so Halo Infinite doesn't hold much appeal to me. It's sad, I used to be a huge Halo fan, but the series went to shit.
[0:37:18] <%Piemen99> yes do a gambit
[0:37:21] <%crimsonharvest> whats up bullshit
[0:37:23] <%Maids4lyfe> gambit is a pvpve mode
[0:37:24] <%Agami23> right, warzone. which would be cool without the loot boxs. pvevp was a cool idea
[0:37:26] <@lewdskeletor13> I gotta sleep cause I’m a baby. Night Pat, night everyone
[0:37:26] <%dekkitout> Hive, bring a sword!
[0:37:28] <$Bison_Says_YES> Holy shit i ACTUALLY forgot Anthem was a thing
[0:37:28] <%ElenaManetta> dab-- no wait
[0:37:28] <$Timesteel> gambit is competitive pve
[0:37:32] <+Ryan1016> Not a moba
[0:37:35] <Crushter> no
[0:37:35] <%dekkitout> Yes, it's a moba
[0:37:35] <%Maids4lyfe> yes
[0:37:36] <%Roasted_Pheasant> This is not a moba
[0:37:36] <MasterDecoder> Not a MOBA
[0:37:37] <%SirGO0SE> wait what no
[0:37:37] <%doc_ock_rokc> ehhj
[0:37:37] <+Fynale> you get dark souls invaded
[0:37:37] <%Piemen99> what
[0:37:40] <+kingofbumbles> It is not sir
[0:37:41] <+bigcomfyman> no it's an mmo
[0:37:41] <%Titannel> I still have to remind myself that Gears of War had a 4th version and a spin-off. And that Halo 5 exists.
[0:37:42] <Badgerconda_> your face is a moba
[0:37:42] <%AncelDeLambert> what?
[0:37:43] <%Piemen99> what's a moba
[0:37:43] <%sjay449> not really
[0:37:44] <$boxboten> its 100% a moba
[0:37:45] <machshop> gambit is like vs. firefight
[0:37:45] <%Jay_Squirrel> youll get it just try it out
[0:37:45] <ItIsSky> a half moba
[0:37:45] <Valdorick> Ha, we tricked you, you're playing a moba now
[0:37:46] <+angel949> yes and no
[0:37:46] <goroke> It's PvPvE
[0:37:48] <%crimsonharvest> no but it is a loot game with loot that doesn't matter
[0:37:48] <Cattadope> Agree I’m not buying a one x, isn’t halo going to be on PC?
[0:37:48] <acecondeuce> Do it anyway
[0:37:49] <+d00msdaydan> it's like a moba if jungling was 90% of the match
[0:37:49] <%wsintai> @AngriestPat Worse; You're playing a waifu Gacha Moba
[0:37:50] <DesuDesuDokiDoki> does it have anime waifus???
[0:37:50] <BlueSpartan119> none
[0:37:50] <+kingofbumbles> There is no jungling
[0:37:51] <%Maids4lyfe> none
[0:37:51] <%ElenaManetta> Yeah, say that sentence faster so it sounds like gibberish
[0:37:51] <+bigcomfyman> it's pvpve
[0:37:52] <+Brewstamasta> Like half
[0:37:53] <MasterDecoder> None
[0:37:53] <%AncelDeLambert> do... do you know what a moba is?
[0:37:53] <%sjay449> none
[0:37:53] <+Delror> it actually is kind of a moba
[0:37:54] <%doc_ock_rokc> yes
[0:37:54] <+newmanq22> No
[0:37:54] <+THEmetallicfloyd> Oh dear
[0:37:54] <%Craytonex> hybrid game mode
[0:37:54] <%ElenaManetta> this mode is a moba
[0:37:54] <ObsidianDragon86> It's 100% Jungling
[0:37:55] <+Fynale> @AngriestPat it's mob farming with dark souls invading
[0:37:55] <%Roasted_Pheasant> Oh wait Gambit. Yeah Gambit is a moba.
[0:37:56] <+Ryan1016> None you can invade tho
[0:37:57] <%Maids4lyfe> there is none
[0:37:57] <$afronooch> ????
[0:37:57] <%MonsieurHedge> i dont even pat knows what a moba IS
[0:37:58] <%AncelDeLambert> this hurts
[0:37:59] <QuasarKnightGaming> It’s a race against other players in PVE
[0:37:59] <MartiusGW> you can invade do its dark souls
[0:38:01] <$D_day> 1 whole Jungle
[0:38:02] <%Roasted_Pheasant> Gambit is a moba.
[0:38:04] <%dekkitout> 1-8 junglings a round
[0:38:04] <dabeaminator> There are multiple people in an arena, so my stupid smartass friends would say it's a Moba.
[0:38:05] <SpaceGuntank> PvPvE, so yes its very MOBA-lite
[0:38:06] <The_Penndragon> Pat show us what ship you're using
[0:38:06] <%nofestu2> mefense of bhe ancients
[0:38:07] <+bigcomfyman> kill things and sometimes kill people
[0:38:08] <jettybandit> Just bring a sword the rest is cake
[0:38:09] <%dekkitout> Best of 3
[0:38:10] <+THEmetallicfloyd> He's gonna get whacked by so many truth rockets
[0:38:11] <EpslionBear> its 100% jungle
[0:38:12] <Ion_Laser> @cattadope Windows Store and Steam
[0:38:14] <Cattadope> Aren’t all Microsoft first parties coming to pc now
[0:38:15] <+Fynale> prepare for cool character
[0:38:18] <%realm_forge> Im having that veteran rpg player anxiety watching a new player
[0:38:22] <%Titannel> This game is actually a visual novel.
[0:38:28] <GrayMatterNZ> Basics of gambit: kill shit, collect notes, bank em, invade the other team and kill them. First to kill the boss wins the round, first to 2 rounds wins
[0:38:28] <The_Penndragon> It's not a moba >_>
[0:38:28] <Cattadope> Oh nice didn’t know about steam
[0:38:29] <%Piemen99> @realm_forge SAME
[0:38:36] <%BallerSwagBro9k> Awwww
[0:38:38] <+THEmetallicfloyd> I very much enjoy destiny and the community
[0:38:39] <$Bison_Says_YES> @Titannel LULW
[0:38:40] <%MonsieurHedge> does this game have a better TTK than warframe's "literally instant"
[0:38:40] <The_Penndragon> Pat show us what ship you're using
[0:38:41] <Futurecity10> lol gay
[0:38:43] <%Roasted_Pheasant> HAHA THIS GUY LOVES HIS MOM
[0:38:44] <+Fynale> alright alright alright
[0:38:45] <%dekkitout> Aww, gey <3
[0:38:45] <+primax104> Hey Pat!!!
[0:38:45] <%SirGO0SE> AWWW You're HUUUMAAAN
[0:38:46] <QuasarKnightGaming> It’s a PVE race against other players that turns into PVP
[0:38:48] <jettybandit> Alright alright alright
[0:38:48] <$afronooch> Kabr's something
[0:38:51] <+Fynale> let's see who we got today
[0:38:51] <%ElenaManetta> you can't roll back love
[0:39:00] <+bigcomfyman> glass aegis
[0:39:02] <$afronooch> Kabr's Aegis
[0:39:04] <jettybandit> Vex on the field
[0:39:06] <LeftOverPizza13> i don't know which pack to get to get all the content
[0:39:07] <%MonsieurHedge> and do you have to pay attention to PvE, unlike warframe where you can clear the hardest content with a single click
[0:39:08] <IndoorSitup> Halo 5's campaign was shit but the multiplayer is pretty damn good.
[0:39:11] <+Fynale> bring a sword
[0:39:14] <BlueSpartan119> Transmat Firing
[0:39:16] <%dekkitout> Space-hobo Drifter's a rad guy
[0:39:17] <+Fynale> drifter is the fucking best
[0:39:19] <jettybandit> I call Vex
[0:39:19] <%Maids4lyfe> kill the mans
[0:39:20] <%Roasted_Pheasant> @IndoorSitup so it's like every halo?
[0:39:23] <goroke> You kill shit, collect motes, and bank it
[0:39:24] <+bigcomfyman> alright alright alright
[0:39:25] <$Timesteel> kill stuff and bank motes
[0:39:26] <+kingofbumbles> Drifter is pretty RADICAL
[0:39:27] <Iriyia> @AngriestPat is this game still going f2p in a few months?
[0:39:27] <goroke> and kill boss in the end
[0:39:27] <%ArcanumMBD> kill things get points dump points kill things
[0:39:28] <+THEmetallicfloyd> Bank your damn motes. Don't forget.
[0:39:29] <+FennecZephyr> @AngriestPat Kill aliens bank motes
[0:39:29] <$afronooch> Kill, pick up motes, take motes to bank

[0:39:39] <SpaceGuntank> SHOOT EVERYTHING and deliver the orbs to the thingy
[0:39:40] <Geno4344> Are Cabal still the best aliens?
[0:39:45] <JamboLovePanda> when the man says bank your notes, you bank your motes
[0:39:45] <+angel949> should be a tutorial for first time
[0:39:47] <%realm_forge> @piemen99 it’s that feeling where you’re scared as hell they’re gonna hate it but they’re starting at the deep end
[0:39:48] <$afronooch> GET THOSE MOTES TO THE BANK BROTHER. i'll make you rich
[0:39:49] <%sjay449> alright alright alright

[0:39:54] <%SolverCODO> whoa I thought mine eyes had deceived me
[0:39:54] <%Bailey__gaming> @angriestpat kikk dudes collect the shiny take shiny to middle
[0:39:55] <Valdorick> Oh wow, how nice of Pat to be giving the Enclave screen time.
[0:39:59] <%Titannel> I mean, alright? This is alright, isn't it?
[0:39:59] <+Ryan1016> Drifter is the best
[0:40:01] <dabeaminator> Halo 5's multiplayer was driven by random loot box REQ Pack bullshit, it was NOT good.
[0:40:02] <jettybandit> Depo those motes
[0:40:03] <QuasarKnightGaming> Kill enemy, pick up mote, bank the motes. Once he tells you you are invading, kill the enemy players
[0:40:04] <%MonsieurHedge> is this competetive ESO?
[0:40:05] <%Jay_Squirrel> wow that reload is painful
[0:40:05] <%wsintai> Fuck the planet

[0:40:22] <IndoorSitup> @dabeaminator Except that's fucking wrong.
[0:40:24] <%realm_forge> Collect the shiny!
[0:40:24] <Crushter> Drifter is canonically greasy
[0:40:28] <narusao> mankind's oldest and greatest enemy... trees
[0:40:28] <+Fynale> @AngriestPat the drifter is morally grey but benign
[0:40:29] <+THEmetallicfloyd> Gambit is fun until it really isn't
[0:40:29] <+Ryan1016> You did not
[0:40:30] <%Titannel> "Is that person you? No? Shoot it!"
[0:40:35] <MasterDecoder> Gotta walk over them
[0:40:35] <%dekkitout> Enemies physically drop them
[0:40:36] <$Timesteel> got to collect them
[0:40:36] <+kingofbumbles> And canonically a hungy boi
[0:40:37] <ItIsSky> otheres are gathering them
[0:40:38] <%Maids4lyfe> your teammates picked them up @AngriestPat
[0:40:39] <IntrepidEye> teammate took them
[0:40:39] <IndoorSitup> @dabeaminator Who lied to you?
[0:40:42] <MessyBristles> is that raiden?
[0:40:45] <+Fynale> bank those motes and summon a primevil
[0:40:46] <BlueSpartan119> pick up pyramids, put in cylinder
[0:40:49] <dabeaminator> The game? I played it.
[0:40:51] <QuasarKnightGaming> Your teammates are picking them up
[0:41:02] <%Emperor_Machinus> This makes me want to play Titanfall 2
[0:41:07] <%dekkitout> You die, your motes go bye bye
[0:41:08] <+kingofbumbles> Sorry, is this on PC or console?
[0:41:08] <$afronooch> get 3 more
[0:41:08] <jettybandit> Just feed your teammates the motes and more effective instead of everyone fighting for them.
[0:41:10] <+tavePls> 2 motes PogChamp
[0:41:11] <%Maids4lyfe> you pick up 5 and put them in the bank

[0:41:30] <%realm_forge> Oh can hold 15 max and you can see how many at the top left of the screen
[0:41:30] <+Bad1uck> wow Destiny 2 still exists?
[0:41:35] <PizzicatoFive5> Patrick Boivin, that's the name alright!!!
[0:41:36] <%sjay449> basically dark souls
[0:41:37] <SpaceGuntank> A player from the enemy team is on your side of the field, dont let him kill you
[0:41:39] <StooEsq> Kill the Intruder
[0:41:42] <%Roasted_Pheasant> @AngriestPat Did you see the Titanfall 2 speedrun at SGDQ 2019?
[0:41:45] <cheezbass> i can never tell wtf is going on in these games
[0:41:46] <+Fynale> i told you pat
[0:41:47] <%zamzoph> ROL
[0:41:48] <%Maids4lyfe> LUL
[0:41:50] <QuasarKnightGaming> When you get invaded, enemy players come to kill you. If they kill you you lose.
[0:41:53] <%Bailey__gaming> @angriestpat here comes the other team
[0:41:54] <Crankthulhu> Okay, now I'm interested
[0:41:56] <+THEmetallicfloyd> Invaders will attack you and you'll lose your motes. Bank 75 to summon a boss
[0:41:57] <Crushter> @Bad1uck you're not gonna like this, but not only has it been running along, but it's getting bigger and only going to get bigger
[0:42:00] <%Piemen99> you know that's a much better way of explaining it @AngriestPat
[0:42:01] <%SirGO0SE> ok just like that i get it. this is sweet. i cant wait to finish my deadlines this month and play games again
[0:42:06] <+bigcomfyman> dark souls is destiny
[0:42:08] <$Cattadope> Cheer100 Cheer100 Cheer100 Cheer100 Cheer100 So weird watching this stream after playing the shit out of D1 and playing about 5 hours of D2, looks just like an expansion in a good way
[0:42:09] <%Roasted_Pheasant> @Crankthulhu Now you're motivated?
[0:42:10] <%dekkitout> Also, Invaders get wall hacks, essentially
[0:42:11] <+bigcomfyman> he said it
[0:42:12] <BlueSpartan119> gotta race the other team to summon & kill a boss
[0:42:14] <Crankthulhu> Chat, if I wanted to get in now while the getting's good, what do I need to do?
[0:42:19] <Valdorick> AT the head, not ABOVE the head
[0:42:23] <MasterDecoder> @AngriestPat I'm gonna Tweet you some tips, Master Decoder/@CapnCroc
[0:42:24] <%realm_forge> Every players invade to wipe out your collected motes
[0:42:26] <Crankthulhu> I saw Pat's thread, something about special event stuff?
[0:42:29] <+FennecZephyr> @AngriestPat Oh, bank at 5
[0:42:31] <Reanimator83> 15 motes and you send a large enemy to the other team
[0:42:36] <%dekkitout> @Crankthulhu Wait till october 1, it'll be ftp
[0:42:39] <Crushter> @Crankthulhu depends on what you want to do
[0:42:43] <+Fynale> grenades
[0:42:44] <faegbeard> somewhere between 1mote and 2mote there is an emote
[0:42:45] <Valdorick> So, is Pat the Blue Bar? Because they're fucked if so
[0:42:46] <%NWR_James> !uptime
[0:42:47] <@Moobot> I've been playing this game for how long? Oh only 42m 48s.
[0:42:49] <$afronooch> @Crankthulhu honestly, I'd wait a month. It'll be free and you'll be new with the armor changes
[0:42:49] <%ElenaManetta> pat sounded so sad when he said "i suck" i got sad apatJpeg
[0:42:51] <+Ryan1016> Gambit is a great game mode let down by the meta of power weapons being SO GOOD for invaders that it makes it hard to win without a good invader/right weapons and mods at high levels
[0:42:53] <eiightbiitt> switch to solar
[0:42:57] <carzeri> omg pat is playing density? awesome
[0:43:00] <Crushter> if you want to do the stuff now and get the shinies then get it in now, if you want your life to be easier, get in later
[0:43:03] <RepMetal18> Bank in multiples of 5 to block the other team. Max is 15. @AngriestPat
[0:43:05] <%Maids4lyfe> you can't cash in motes when blockers are out
[0:43:07] <rusho> Using the solar damage on your rifle will help against cabal
[0:43:08] <KingKZ> Not like that.
[0:43:11] <%Emperor_Machinus> cashed in
[0:43:14] <IndoorSitup> Density 2: Foreskin
[0:43:14] <%Maids4lyfe> you have to kill the taken to deposit mots
[0:43:16] <+THEmetallicfloyd> Kill the blockers to open the bank
[0:43:17] <rusho> Since Cabal use solar shields
[0:43:17] <+Fynale> that guys running the outbreak like they cool
[0:43:17] <%dekkitout> You deposit motes in increments of 5 to send enemies to the other team
[0:43:18] <%Maids4lyfe> *motes
[0:43:18] <$Timesteel> need to clear the taken off the bank
[0:43:18] <%Bailey__gaming> @angriestpat kill the middle dudes
[0:43:21] <+Ryan1016> Index but good
[0:43:22] <$Timesteel> ya kinda
[0:43:23] <+bigcomfyman> gambit scales with ur power level too so ur under level
[0:43:26] <+Foobe> it's better than index
[0:43:28] <+newmanq22> Lol pat u are wrong
[0:43:34] <%ShichiNoBushi> To Aru Majutsu no Index?
[0:43:35] <faegbeard> where's nef when you need him
[0:43:38] <$afronooch> kill the shiny for more motes
[0:43:49] <IntrepidEye> turn in at cylinder in the middle. Enemy team can send enemies over to block it until you kill them
[0:43:50] <+Ryan1016> The middle
[0:43:52] <+kingofbumbles> At the bug light Pat
[0:43:53] <faegbeard> investor down
[0:43:53] <%Maids4lyfe> IN THE CENTER
[0:43:53] <bigobama> in the middle
[0:43:53] <MasterDecoder> Middle
[0:43:54] <KingKZ> WTF is even happening?
[0:43:55] <%Roasted_Pheasant> "This is just Dark Souls Index MOBA Halo" - @AngriestPat 2019
[0:43:55] <carzeri> in the center
[0:43:56] <+Fynale> @AngriestPat there's a bank in the middle of the map
[0:43:57] <rusho> Middle
[0:43:58] <Valdorick> Guardian, do you remember, the Conclave. Even outside Warframe, you must remember the Conclave. You may bank it, at the Conclave.
[0:43:58] <%SirGO0SE> the pyramid you were shooting at earlier
[0:43:59] <GrayMatterNZ> Middle
[0:44:03] <%dekkitout> At the giant cylinder in the middle
[0:44:05] <ConLin_Arts_> Is this Salmon Run?
[0:44:07] <%Piemen99> where the teammates put it
[0:44:08] <QuasarKnightGaming> The pyramid of darkness
[0:44:09] <%Piemen99> NOOO
[0:44:09] <%dekkitout> NO
[0:44:12] <%Maids4lyfe> THAT
[0:44:12] <dabeaminator> Alright, being able to Palpatine it up and shoot lightning is pretty cool.
[0:44:13] <+Ryan1016> The cylinder
[0:44:13] <Iriyia> @AngriestPat When you put 5/10/15 you send a mob at the enemy, they can't put their motes away until they kill the add. It's not usually worth it to bank any until you have a multiple of 5. It's the big tube thing at the begining that you tried to shoot
[0:44:16] <BlueSpartan119> the second one
[0:44:18] <MasterDecoder> Pillar, not Portal
[0:44:19] <%Jay_Squirrel> yeh jump in the portal
[0:44:19] <%Piemen99> THAT YES WHITE THING
[0:44:19] <%SirGO0SE> the second thiiiis
[0:44:19] <rusho> It's the white bank in the center
[0:44:20] <%Maids4lyfe> THE CYLINDER
[0:44:20] <%realm_forge> Bank in the middle
[0:44:21] <+Brewstamasta> That second one
[0:44:21] <carzeri> not the portal, the second "thiiiiis"
[0:44:21] <%dekkitout> NOT THE PORTAL
[0:44:22] <+FennecZephyr> @AngriestPat it's the tube
[0:44:24] <rusho> NOT the portal
[0:44:24] <+Fynale> @AngriestPat the portal is the invasion portal the big cylinder is the bank
[0:44:29] <ScreamLord> Holy shit I didn't kinow Pat ws gonnago live after Paige
[0:44:33] <midgetzoo> Second this

[0:44:34] <%Bailey__gaming> @angriestpat the triangles on the big cylinder
[0:44:34] <$D_day> middle is the Bank, Portal is to invade
[0:44:35] <%realm_forge> The cylinder

[0:44:53] <corrosivePaladin> You are super losing
[0:44:53] <Reanimator83> The machine
[0:44:54] <strudelhime> go jump into the portal
[0:44:54] <%Emperor_Machinus> It's your enemies's pockets where you cash them in
[0:44:55] <Frostydough> @AngriestPat You'll believe the same people that lied about what dialouge to say to Yuffie???
[0:45:01] <ConLin_Arts_> oh Hey Paige!
[0:45:03] <+Bad1uck> the biggest winner
[0:45:03] <%dekkitout> They have their boss up, killing them heals their boss to stall them
[0:45:04] <%Piemen99> YOU DID IT
[0:45:07] <MasterDecoder> It's ok cause you're learning
[0:45:12] <Assaultpanda> @AngriestPat you think Destiny needs more quantum?
[0:45:12] <%ShichiNoBushi> You're a winner, Pat. Have a Lemon Squeezy.

[0:45:51] <%salty_syd913> LUL
[0:45:55] <FreeFuzeIcedTea> Hi Pat! Never come to one of these random late night streams before, pretty cool
[0:45:56] <+bigcomfyman> r00d
[0:45:56] <QuasarKnightGaming> Pat, gambit works best if you deposit in sets of 5. Once you do enough, you can fight a prime evil. Once you kill that, you win.
[0:45:58] <Ion_Laser> :D
[0:45:58] <+DusK_The_Stray> D:
[0:45:58] <ConLin_Arts_> So is this Salmon Run for Nerds?

[0:45:59] <+AlchemiBeast> hell yeah we are
[0:46:00] <%SirGO0SE> we're YOUR IDIOTS you fuckboi
[0:46:00] <+Brewstamasta> I knew it
[0:46:01] <+koyomi_araragi990> thanks
[0:46:04] <%Roasted_Pheasant> HOW CAN THIS BE
[0:46:06] <%Maids4lyfe> because they sent 5
[0:46:08] <faegbeard> shoot the enemy and he ceases to be
[0:46:09] <%Maids4lyfe> no pat
[0:46:09] <$Cattadope> Hell yeah big idiots unite
[0:46:13] <%Maids4lyfe> IT SENDS THE BLOCKERS
[0:46:13] <+bigcomfyman> it sends a taken
[0:46:16] <dabeaminator> ATTACK TREES
[0:46:16] <+Ryan1016> 75 total summons boss, you can invade at intervals of 25 mots @AngriestPat
[0:46:19] <$afronooch> yall are only still in there cause you gotta baller invader
[0:46:19] <%dekkitout> There's another team doing the exact same thing
[0:46:20] <BlueSpartan119> no it spawns enemy's around their bank
[0:46:20] <corrosivePaladin> No pat banking sends Taken enemies. The normal guys spawn seperately
[0:46:25] <+Fynale> 75 motes summons the boss
[0:46:30] <%Jay_Squirrel> after this go to the furthest north landing zone on nessus and get 690 light gear from the barge @angriestpat
[0:46:31] <%realm_forge> Bank rough motes to summon a boss then the bar turns yellow
[0:46:31] <+Fynale> you kill boss and you win round
[0:46:32] <%Emperor_Machinus> I don't care for game. I came to hear Pat sing
[0:46:33] <%Roasted_Pheasant> DIG UP, STUPID
[0:46:37] <QuasarKnightGaming> You can kill the enemy players if you go through the portal
[0:46:39] <%Maids4lyfe> you lost
[0:46:40] <%ThePuddingDead> ok then...?
[0:46:42] <ConLin_Arts_> LUL
[0:46:43] <Spawntaneous501> REKT
[0:46:44] <KingKZ> Good job
[0:46:44] <+kingofbumbles> Who'd have thought we'd see Hard Light in August of 2019
[0:46:45] <Valdorick> They killed the Dragon in the Jungle and won.
[0:46:47] <%st4rrytea> no
[0:46:47] <$JJnAJjohnson> is Destiny 2 good now?
[0:46:52] <$afronooch> ye
[0:46:53] <+Ryan1016> Te'
[0:46:53] <+Delror> he just skipped the tutorialm essage...
[0:46:54] <Reanimator83> Watching pat play destiny while playing destiny FailFish
[0:46:54] <BlueSpartan119> best of 3 rounds
[0:46:55] <+Ryan1016> Ye*
[0:46:55] <%Bailey__gaming> @angriestpat op team won
[0:46:56] <%Jay_Squirrel> yeh
[0:46:58] <EpslionBear> its a race, your team is slow
[0:47:01] <%ThePuddingDead> this is strange
[0:47:02] <+kingofbumbles> Hahahahahaha I'm jokin Pat!
[0:47:04] <+angel949> at 75 motes it summons a boss, kill the boss too win.
[0:47:06] <IntrepidEye> You have to get enough motes to summon boss. First team to kill their boss wins
[0:47:12] <corrosivePaladin> Even trash is better then Hard Light
[0:47:13] <%ShichiNoBushi> Pull those socks up high, because I like that Zettai Ryouiki.
[0:47:17] <$afronooch> pat if you do campaign it'll give you good gear
[0:47:26] <%Piemen99> Pat is baby they understand @AngriestPat
[0:47:26] <%MonsieurHedge> pat's just here to see the new content, you don't pay his sub fee!
[0:47:29] <%realm_forge> Round 2 bank enough motes to summon a boss. Kill the boss to win the round
[0:47:31] <+Ryan1016> @AngriestPat Dual primary gonna give you low dps btw, might wanna do more campaign stuff just to get weapons so you have a bigger arsenal for pvp/pve
[0:47:34] <%ThePuddingDead> the pat cant run he's like a dnd dwarf with those....stubby legs and can-do attitude
[0:47:36] <%dekkitout> Hard Light's better than Rat King atleast Kappa
[0:47:37] <+kingofbumbles> Pat just work on that solstice grind, the BASE armor is 700 light!
[0:47:38] <%Roasted_Pheasant> Use big ult become big lightning boy
[0:47:38] <ScreamLord> @AngriestPat You get motes from the normal dudes. Then you bank 5, 10, or 15 and it blocks the other team from making progress. When your bank is full it summons a boss
[0:47:43] <ConLin_Arts_> The one problem I have with this game, man does it look bland
[0:47:45] <+Foobe> if you're concerned about losing motes, just let your team pick up the bulk of it all.
[0:47:49] <+qreaper> punching them is better than that gun
[0:47:50] <eiightbiitt> you have to get 75 notes to summon the boss first to kill the boss wins but be careful for invading enemies on the opposing team @angriestpat
[0:47:50] <+cinder_chan> if you're shit in thise mode your balls will be straight exposed in the ending screen
[0:47:51] <+kingofbumbles> even if you dont go for the rest it helps higher gear drop for you!
[0:47:56] <Crushter> @dekkitout anything's better than Rat King
[0:47:58] <Spawntaneous501> pat needs some gfuel
[0:48:07] <+Ryan1016> Don't disrespect rat king
[0:48:08] <el_phthalo> Well at least there's no turtles. I can't believe I slept through that
[0:48:14] <$Dutchpotato> Destiny 2 :o
[0:48:16] <BlueSpartan119> snipers, fusions rifles & shotguns are no longer heavy weapons
[0:48:23] <+Ryan1016> It goes away when they send over taken
[0:48:23] <%Maids4lyfe> the blockers blocked it
[0:48:27] <corrosivePaladin> Cylindar hides when theres a Taken enemy
[0:48:28] <BlueSpartan119> taken blockers make the cylinder hide
[0:48:29] <ScreamLord> @AngriestPat The other team send Taken to block your bank
[0:48:30] <+Fynale> @AngriestPat when there's taken dudes in the center they're "blocking" the bank
[0:48:34] <+FennecZephyr> @AngriestPat Taken enemies block it
[0:48:34] <+bigcomfyman> if a blocker is up it goes away
[0:48:36] <%dekkitout> When enemies get sent to you, cylinder goes on lock
[0:48:38] <RetributionP> this sucks and I don't like it
[0:48:40] <%realm_forge> Enemies in the middle lock it down
[0:48:42] <IndoorSitup> This stream is the most bumble shit ever lmao
[0:48:44] <LeftOverPizza13> whose the seeker
[0:48:46] <RepMetal18> Kill the taken enemies to unblock your bank @AngriestPat
[0:48:48] <EpslionBear> blockers lock the bank until they're gone
[0:48:50] <+Fynale> @AngriestPat that's why you send in intervals of 5 so you can send stronger and stronger blockers
[0:48:52] <RetributionP> and my day is utterly ruined
[0:48:53] <IndoorSitup> Bumblestream
[0:48:57] <QuasarKnightGaming> If a blocker is up, the cylinder disappears. Gotta kill Taken enemies.
[0:49:01] <+Ryan1016> Big think by Pat
[0:49:02] <ScreamLord> Pat confused
[0:49:07] <+bigcomfyman> the blockers are the taken
[0:49:08] <%Bailey__gaming> @angriestpat you are cockblocked, you kinda neeed 1 person to defend middle
[0:49:08] <%dekkitout> Could be worse, could be Gambit Prime
[0:49:11] <Valdorick> Blockers? Points? Goals? Is this sports ball? Have we been bamboozled into watching Sportsball?
[0:49:13] <ConLin_Arts_> Patfused
[0:49:14] <corrosivePaladin> pat dont lie you dont understand even a little do you
[0:49:17] <LeftOverPizza13> "i get it...I don't get it"
[0:49:20] <%Roasted_Pheasant> "I get it!" Pat said, not getting it.
[0:49:21] <+Foobe> DUNK IT
[0:49:25] <$afronooch> do it
[0:49:25] <carzeri> deposit it
[0:49:31] <Crankthulhu> I was put off Destiny by the 3v3 PvP, didn't know it had wacky alt combat like this
[0:49:32] <Spawntaneous501> shrekt 3
[0:49:33] <+Foobe> well, too late maybe.
[0:49:50] <QuasarKnightGaming> Taken enemies are blockers, gotta kill them to bank stuff. Kill other enemies to get Motes. Use Motes to summon the big guy, kill the big guy to win the round.
[0:49:50] <+Ryan1016> Teammate saved you
[0:49:50] <%realm_forge> Ha warlock jump
[0:49:51] <Crushter> set locations around the map
[0:49:56] <+bigcomfyman> that's the enemy player
[0:49:56] <%SirGO0SE> good super
[0:49:58] <IndoorSitup> THIS IS WHY YOU REMAP YOUR CONTROLS TO BUMPER JUMPER
[0:50:00] <BlueSpartan119> invaders spawn where your team isnt
[0:50:02] <ScreamLord> You...did it
[0:50:03] <+Fynale> @AngriestPat invaders spawn randomly but you can see the direction on your map like you can any enemy
[0:50:06] <%dekkitout> The invaders have set spawns, they spawn where you/your team isn't
[0:50:09] <Reanimator83> Don’t get greedy pat
[0:50:12] <%realm_forge> YAAAAAAY
[0:50:13] <+Fynale> @AngriestPat they can see you through walls like in dark souls
[0:50:15] <$afronooch> other team, but in Gambit they usually spawn furthest away from you/whatever side you AREN'T
[0:50:17] <$Dutchpotato> why does the commentator sound like a guy from south park?
[0:50:21] <IntrepidEye> Baba is Pat
[0:50:21] <%dekkitout> It's quite easy to finess
[0:50:22] <%mjkenney24> kill bad man
[0:50:25] <%tweedler92> octo200IQ octo200IQ octo200IQ
[0:50:28] <+Foobe> Warlocks are the most galaxy brain, so
[0:50:30] <+Ryan1016> Pat is BIG confused
[0:50:35] <%ghostfarts315> kill the bad man
[0:50:35] <+Hmkks> Badman, Batman or Bedman?
[0:50:37] <ConLin_Arts_> Badman is Kill
[0:50:39] <%realm_forge> invaders spawn at certain points around the map
[0:50:40] <IntrepidEye> other team summoned their boss
[0:50:44] <%Piemen99> HOld Y for heavy weapon
[0:50:46] <Valdorick> Yes, this is a good Moba
[0:50:49] <%Piemen99> @AngriestPat
[0:50:50] <%Roasted_Pheasant> Well yeah it's frantic, it's a MOBA Kappa
[0:50:53] <+kingofbumbles> I THINK HE'S GOT IT
[0:50:55] <Crushter> once you get used to it it's less chaotic
[0:50:58] <%dekkitout> It was bad when it first came out- fucking linear fusion rifles...
[0:51:00] <GrayMatterNZ> Youd be surprised how many disagree...
[0:51:03] <+Ryan1016> Yeah it is, heavy weapons will soil your opinion at higher levels but it's got a great core
[0:51:06] <+Fynale> @AngriestPat there's a more advanced version of this with harder bosses called gambit prime that has gear sets designed around team roles
[0:51:07] <BlueSpartan119> I can see myself playing alot of gambit if I ever decide to pick D2 back up
[0:51:07] <+Foobe> he hasn't even gotten to the primeval yet..!
[0:51:10] <strudelhime> go invade too so you try that out
[0:51:23] <%mjkenney24> i keep wanting to get back into this, but i have no idea how the fuck to buy forsaken on its own
[0:51:27] <%realm_forge> Maxing out the bank summons a boss
[0:51:27] <+Fynale> good he's killing envoys first
[0:51:30] <QuasarKnightGaming> Now you need to kill the big guy that just spawned
[0:51:31] <ConLin_Arts_> THAT one
[0:51:32] <BlueSpartan119> kill the envoy's for a damage buff
[0:51:34] <+bigcomfyman> kill small then kill big
[0:51:35] <LeftOverPizza13> if i already have the base game on blizzard do i just need the annual pass to get the rest of the game?
[0:51:41] <RepMetal18> Kill the Envoys first to weaken the boss. @AngriestPat
[0:51:41] <IndoorSitup> Destiny 2: Foreskin
[0:51:43] <corrosivePaladin> Only invader kills heal your boss
[0:51:44] <%Bailey__gaming> @angriestpat kill kill the other yellows 1st then biggie
[0:51:44] <%pilgrimsayswhat> You beat your boss before they beat their boss - it’s a race
[0:51:51] <%ArcanumMBD> F
[0:51:52] <+Ryan1016> Ye thats the boss
[0:51:52] <BlueSpartan119> dying whit an invader present heals your boss
[0:51:56] <ScreamLord> @AngriestPat Whenever a 3rd of your bank is filled the portal next to your bank opens and lets you invade the other team. The location you or an enemy invader appears in is random
[0:51:56] <ConLin_Arts_> Biggest Boi
[0:51:56] <%realm_forge> Invader kills Hal the boss
[0:51:59] <%mjkenney24> pat man dead
[0:52:00] <$Timesteel> invader kills will heal the boss
[0:52:09] <%SomeNEET> SomeNEET subscribed with Twitch Prime. They've subscribed for 11 months, currently on a 1 month streak! why is outer wilds so good tho
[0:52:11] <strudelhime> killing the envoys gets your team a damage multiplier buff
[0:52:12] <%pilgrimsayswhat> Gambit is the SHIT
[0:52:14] <%Piemen99> JUst wait until you get good at it
[0:52:16] <+Foobe> you can have a lot of fun in gambit, but a lot of salt too
[0:52:21] <+Ryan1016> Gloves PogChamp
[0:52:24] <Crushter> killing the Envoys is very important @AngriestPat
[0:52:29] <%ElenaManetta> cUE THE JOKES
[0:52:31] <carzeri> there is also a more extreme version of this called gambit prime or something like that
[0:52:31] <Tubit> what's this. competitive pve?
[0:52:32] <%zamzoph> PepeHands
[0:52:32] <Valdorick> Your best isn't good enough! /s
[0:52:35] <+Ryan1016> Knowing is half the battle
[0:52:35] <+bigcomfyman> and we are very proud of you pat
[0:52:35] <%dekkitout> This gamemode is Destiny pve encounters in a nutshell, a dps race
[0:52:37] <Segartner> you did your best pat
[0:52:39] <%realm_forge> You got some better gloves
[0:52:40] <+Fynale> killing the envoys gives you a damage buff vs the main boss
[0:52:41] <ScreamLord> @AngriestPat And when your boss is spawned it lets the other team invade more frequently to kill you and heal your boss
[0:52:47] <%NWR_James> if that was six Pats god help us all
[0:52:55] <goroke> I could probably 1v6 Pats in gambit lol
[0:53:03] <IndoorSitup> If there were six Pats it would be the height of an average male.
[0:53:04] <Segartner> wow Pat's inventory is trash
[0:53:08] <dabeaminator> I'm gonna get some sleep, later y'all
[0:53:09] <%pilgrimsayswhat> I’m tempted to get back in just to play Gambit; I adore it
[0:53:10] <corrosivePaladin> Ohgod pat is only 300?
[0:53:20] <ConLin_Arts_> why not use better gear?
[0:53:28] <Reanimator83> @leftoverpizza13 I believe so. The new dlc Is separate from the season pass though
[0:53:30] <+Foobe> so powerful
[0:53:32] <corrosivePaladin> Drifter has some bounties that give you 690 gear i believe
[0:53:32] <+bigcomfyman> most did
[0:53:33] <%dekkitout> 'Dailies' reset Tuesday and Thursday
[0:53:34] <ScreamLord> Oof
[0:53:38] <%Jay_Squirrel> thats fair, osiris is garbage

[0:53:51] <+bigcomfyman> play forsaken and u get better gear
[0:53:52] <%ElenaManetta> Why not hit start and be maxed out
[0:53:52] <%ArcanumMBD> Just use better gear Pat Kappa
[0:53:54] <+Fynale> @AngriestPat so every day on a rotation a different activity will be a daily and get you an item that's a guaranteed upgrade and there's a weekly for all of them
[0:53:55] <Crankthulhu> JUST DO BETTER 4HEAD
[0:53:56] <$Dutchpotato> Just use better gear dummy

[0:54:02] <fatalDestiny> Heck yeah it is
[0:54:03] <%Jay_Squirrel> it could be
[0:54:04] <%MonsieurHedge> ...why not?
[0:54:05] <carzeri> why is it not?
[0:54:05] <$ESP_ROOT> do it though
[0:54:06] <corrosivePaladin> The time to start the campain is when it isnt finished
[0:54:07] <%king_wragles> @AngriestPat like make it appear
[0:54:07] <Segartner> it could be
[0:54:08] <%ArcanumMBD> Just conjur better gear out of thin air
[0:54:09] <QuasarKnightGaming> @geno4344 nah max is like 750 or so
[0:54:09] <+bigcomfyman> then do it later
[0:54:12] <%realm_forge> yes it is
[0:54:17] <%The_Esquana> The_Esquana subscribed at Tier 1. They've subscribed for 11 months, currently on a 11 month streak! hey gamer
[0:54:18] <ScreamLord> Forsaken's story is pretty decent.
[0:54:19] <%doc_ock_rokc> night
[0:54:20] <+bigcomfyman> u have a full two months for solstice
[0:54:21] <IndoorSitup> The story for this game sucks anyway
[0:54:23] <Halfeatenoreo> its 4:30am here :)
[0:54:23] <carzeri> do the campaign like a true man
[0:54:23] <%Craytonex> you wont get max level gear unless you're level 50
[0:54:26] <Crushter> @AngriestPat Genuinely you should try to get to max level before worrying about gear
[0:54:26] <Segartner> you could do drifter power bounties.
[0:54:26] <AnEnemyStandu> !uptime
[0:54:26] <@Moobot> I've been playing this game for how long? Oh only 54m 28s.
[0:54:27] <$afronooch> you can get orbs during the campaign
[0:54:28] <+Ryan1016> In the EAZ
[0:54:30] <bruno_silv0> Pat are planning on doing the newer raids cuz they are great
[0:54:31] <+Fynale> @AngriestPat bounties are like daily quests that you can pick up at the different vendors to do for rewards
[0:54:31] <%realm_forge> The campaign will get your gear up faster
[0:54:32] <%Maids4lyfe> it's only for the EAZ
[0:54:33] <EpslionBear> if you finish the forsaken camp3and have the annual pass you can get level 690 gear
[0:54:34] <Crushter> @IndoorSitup imagine being this smoothbrain
[0:54:35] <ScreamLord> Or rather I should say Campaign
[0:54:37] <%Piemen99> @AngriestPat Dont listen to chat formalize yourself with the game
[0:54:43] <Caidezes> Chat's being a shit. No wonder Warframe's better.
[0:54:46] <MasterDecoder> @AngriestPat Bribe DK to help you
[0:54:51] <%BlackMage66652> So chat... this going about as well as it looks?
[0:54:53] <+angel949> read bounties really carefully
[0:54:56] <+Ryan1016> @Caidezes Chat does this for wf too tbf
[0:54:57] <QuasarKnightGaming> You have to meet ALL of the requirements pat, not just shoot shit
[0:55:00] <%Kazooki_Kazami> jesus i played only the vanilla this game went places
[0:55:01] <IndoorSitup> Warframe will always be better
[0:55:05] <MasterDecoder> OBVIOUSLY NOT NOW STUMBO
[0:55:07] <ConLin_Arts_> I have no idea how this game works
[0:55:07] <corrosivePaladin> i dont think DK can help pat at this point
[0:55:10] <goroke> You could've also booted the EAZ on that flag above, Pat
[0:55:14] <+Foobe> it's tough, getting back up on your legs in this game, so i understand
[0:55:18] <Segartner> @angriestpat you could go talk to the drifter and he'll give you bounties that get you to 690 I believe. (after you hit lvl 50)
[0:55:25] <%Bailey__gaming> @angriestpat I'd help but im ps4 no xplay yet
[0:55:28] <%realm_forge> The campaigns will get your gear up faster
[0:55:32] <+Ryan1016> @Segartner He's gonna do the campaigns first
[0:55:34] <@Moobot> I don't know if I can trust that. (@SirGO0SE) (warning)
[0:55:39] <RevenantJoy> World Bosses!
[0:55:44] <$afronooch> @Segartner think he has to finish forsaken first
[0:55:48] <+Fynale> @AngriestPat i thinkt hey're random bosses you see out in patrol zones
[0:55:51] <%pilgrimsayswhat> It’s so dumb that crossplay hasn’t happened yet for this game
[0:55:52] <%dekkitout> HVT spawn randomly in open world/patrol/expedition
[0:55:52] <+Ryan1016> Randomly spawning yellow bars on planets
[0:55:52] <carzeri> orange/yellow dudes
[0:55:57] <%BlackMage66652> @AngriestPat Are you a Stumbodian of Light?
[0:55:59] <Segartner> @ryan1016 oh I see, his own pace then.
[0:56:05] <ScreamLord> @AngriestPat It's the big glowing dudes in Gambit that drop a shit ton of motes when you damage or kill them
[0:56:05] <+purelyplum> High value targets are random world bosses that show up around patrol zones
[0:56:07] <QuasarKnightGaming> Any enemy with a Yellow health bar in a Patrol (IO, Nessus, Titan
[0:56:10] <%Bailey__gaming> @angriestpat highvalue turn up on patroll areas
[0:56:22] <BlueSpartan119> both?
[0:56:25] <jettybandit> do the event
[0:56:28] <Ion_Laser> @pilgrimsayswhat Bungie might save that for after the transfer of the PC version to Steam
[0:56:28] <+bigcomfyman> solstice is for two months
[0:56:28] <%realm_forge> High value targets are randomly spawning yellow bar enemies. The best places for them are in Forsaken
[0:56:29] <goroke> Nooooooooooooo
[0:56:29] <+qreaper> both
[0:56:33] <pimpingpanda> both
[0:56:34] <+Ryan1016> @AngriestPat It'll catch you up ONCE you hit level 50
[0:56:35] <Caidezes> Do neither.
[0:56:37] <Crushter> @AngriestPat It depends on what you want, your gear is trash until you hit max physical level
[0:56:37] <MasterDecoder> Both, but Solstice has a time limit
[0:56:38] <ConLin_Arts_> Big confuse
[0:56:39] <%ArcanumMBD> Do campaign, but also do solstice because it's limited time
[0:56:40] <$ESP_ROOT> dont play this game
[0:56:40] <bruno_silv0> pat go to xur to buy some exotics, that should give a couple better options
[0:56:41] <%zamzoph> Pat, do everything
[0:56:42] <$valriot> @angriestpat Do the campaign, Solciste after that
[0:56:43] <%Craytonex> the solstice stuff aont catch you up because you're not 50
[0:56:44] <%dekkitout> Solstice GUARANTEES that you'll max level armor
[0:56:45] <QuasarKnightGaming> Solstice is good gear, Campaign is Quick levelling
[0:56:47] <%ThePuddingDead> try it
[0:56:47] <+bigcomfyman> campaign will bring u up to the previous cap
[0:56:49] <ScreamLord> Solstice is time limited
[0:56:49] <+Fynale> @AngriestPat if you were max level yes it would catch you up but you're 20 levels behind
[0:56:50] <IndoorSitup> You should try Spinning instead. It's a good trick.
[0:56:51] <%ElenaManetta> That ship is still so pretty
[0:56:51] <%pilgrimsayswhat> I mean, bumrushing the campaign will open more areas for you to utilize to get stronk
[0:56:52] <EpslionBear> it'll catch you up if you did the campaign
[0:56:54] <pimpingpanda> cause you will need level of the armor
[0:56:54] <+Foobe> right now, to get the best gear, you should be doing whatever gives you the most experience to get to level 50, yes.
[0:56:54] <%ElenaManetta> is that the default ship or a custom one
[0:56:55] <Segartner> I actually have no clue which one to do first. But doing the campaign first I think.
[0:56:57] <%ghostfarts315> do forsaken to get to get lvl 50
[0:56:58] <%Piemen99> @AngriestPat Event EVent EVEnt EVENt EVENT
[0:56:58] <+kingofbumbles> Initial Solstice Gear is 700, you CAN work on the grind but since its all 700 gear the other stuff you get will drop higher!
[0:56:58] <corrosivePaladin> If you do teh solstice stuff first it will be weak. Use the campain to power level THEN get the gear from solctice
[0:57:02] <strudelhime> doing anything levels you up and gets you better shit so just do whatever you want
[0:57:02] <+Ryan1016> Because the gear is 700-750 power
[0:57:06] <Crushter> @AngriestPat because gearscore effectively doesn't matter till you're 50
[0:57:10] <+Ryan1016> Which requires level 50
[0:57:10] <+FennecZephyr> @AngriestPat Max power gear is at level 50
[0:57:10] <%realm_forge> The solstice event doesn’t end until later in the month you got time
[0:57:10] <+purelyplum> Do solstice grind for a bit but your generally trying to grind up to lvl 50
[0:57:10] <+bigcomfyman> cuz they use levels for dumb reasons
[0:57:11] <%Craytonex> lignt levels scale
[0:57:12] <fru1tycak3> Legendary Solstice Armor Drops at 750
[0:57:12] <%BlackMage66652> @AngriestPat Because you don't get light levels yet
[0:57:13] <Segartner> 700 gear is for lvl 50 peeps
[0:57:15] <ScreamLord> @AngriestPat Because all the best gear is lvl 50
[0:57:16] <pimpingpanda> Solstice Gear is going to end on the 27
[0:57:22] <QuasarKnightGaming> You won’t be able to use the gear at that level
[0:57:23] <%ghostfarts315> why not?
[0:57:26] <+qreaper> then your fucked
[0:57:32] <rusho> You don't have to do forsaken on 3 toons
[0:57:32] <+Fynale> @AngriestPat it's like ilvl in 14 when you're max you start at ilvl 600 and the cap it 650 solstice will catch you up to ilvl 650
[0:57:35] <rusho> Who says that?
[0:57:41] <%pilgrimsayswhat> Then just do the one
[0:57:51] <%ShichiNoBushi> Doggos.
[0:57:54] <%Reaped_Psyche> They spawned you on the boss
[0:57:54] <%SirGO0SE> woof
[0:57:55] <$ESP_ROOT> cool
[0:57:57] <%nofestu2> oopsydoodle
[0:58:00] <%Emperor_Machinus> bork bork
[0:58:02] <MasterDecoder> No, you do
[0:58:02] <StooEsq> FrankerZ
[0:58:05] <+Ryan1016> No you do if you want to play all 3 characters
[0:58:06] <pimpingpanda> nope
[0:58:08] <MasterDecoder> You totally do
[0:58:12] <%BlackMage66652> BLAST ALL THE BORKS
[0:58:14] <+bigcomfyman> there's a catchup mission with the new annual pass dlc
[0:58:15] <IndoorSitup> PAT IS SO FUCKEN LOST OMG
[0:58:18] <$afronooch> you do if you want to do endgame stuff on all three
[0:58:19] <+Ryan1016> 3 characters is a huge ordeal tho
[0:58:20] <SpaceGuntank> who the fuck still says "toons"
[0:58:20] <%Reaped_Psyche> Wait, why would you have to do it on all three toons? What's the goal there?
[0:58:25] <+angel949> only the base campaign I believe
[0:58:28] <ScreamLord> LUL
[0:58:30] <+bigcomfyman> gives u one piece of equip all 640
[0:58:31] <$afronooch> LUL
[0:58:32] <+Ryan1016> I do :)
[0:58:40] <+Fynale> @AngriestPat playing alts isn't that great or useful anymore due to the changes brought in forsaken
[0:58:40] <Crushter> @AngriestPat you're asking a chat room and picking advice at random
[0:58:41] <sonofthedeepsouth> SECRET STREAM
[0:58:42] <+Ryan1016> I got like 1500 hours
[0:58:47] <$afronooch> ye
[0:58:48] <pimpingpanda> yep
[0:58:49] <Segartner> yeah nobody knows anything about destiny leveling experience. everyone just forgot
[0:58:49] <+Ryan1016> Yeah people dip after minibosses a lot
[0:58:57] <MasterDecoder> OH NO
[0:59:05] <BlueSpartan119> cant he boost his light by getting the menagerie chalice?
[0:59:05] <%dekkitout> Probably, people leave only for the miniboss kills, it's getting patched Tuesday
[0:59:06] <%BlackMage66652> *screams into the void*
[0:59:10] <+Foobe> just because a portion of the players have three characters, doesn't mean you should have to do that. catchup is absolutely a thing rn
[0:59:10] <%Reaped_Psyche> Oh no, pats getting caught on the grinders
[0:59:15] <pimpingpanda> you the only one cause of the mini boss framing
[0:59:17] <%Piemen99> Someone just joined
[0:59:19] <%doug_famous> Hell yeah, 3 AM Pat stream
[0:59:21] <+purelyplum> Just do one character at a time and dont rush yourself yes your alone until Tuesday when patch drops to incentivise people to stay to kill boss
[0:59:21] <RevenantJoy> There's a later step that requires a lot of mibiboss kills in this zone. Odds are your team dipped.
[0:59:32] <%realm_forge> Oh god this the worst way to jump back in
[0:59:35] <+Fynale> @AngriestPat you could do warmind in like an hour and a hafl if you wanted to do it for a short stream
[0:59:35] <%Reaped_Psyche> Exit Pat. Your team left you to deal with the bosses yourself.
[0:59:40] <%SirGO0SE> @Ryan1016 is DIM still the shit? i swear it was the only way i could manage my characters
[0:59:47] <Segartner> @angriestpat you could just focus on one guy and get him to max lvl first before going to the other two.
[0:59:48] <fru1tycak3> Yep
[0:59:49] <$afronooch> @SirGO0SE it is
[0:59:49] <+bigcomfyman> yup
[0:59:50] <+Ryan1016> @SirGO0SE Yes DIM is great
[0:59:50] <$valriot> @angriestpat Trust me, do Forsaken Campaign, which will let you reach high level cap, all weekly/daily rewards become Powerful Gear which is significantly better Light Level
[0:59:56] <%SirGO0SE> phew
[0:59:57] <%pilgrimsayswhat> SHOOT MY SHIELD WEAK SPOT WE MADE IT WITH
[0:59:59] <IndoorSitup> SOMEONE CONTACT PAT ON VOICE CHAT AND HELP HIM PLS
[1:00:06] <Crushter> @AngriestPat do you have someone to help you directly that plays this regularly otherwise I dunno how you're gonna get help
[1:00:09] <bruno_silv0> solstice armor is gonna be extremely valueable cuz when armor 2.0 drops you can convert it into the new system
[1:00:22] <+Ryan1016> @AngriestPat You want me to /join on you pat so you have people to do EAZ with?
[1:00:23] <+kingofbumbles> PitPat the TwitchTwat: Have you visited XUR
[1:00:25] <+Delror> yeah, most of the stuff you'll be getting now will either be low level, or stuff you can't use until high level
[1:00:26] <%realm_forge> YES
[1:00:27] <MasterDecoder> @AngriestPat Wait for tomorrow for EAZ with DK, he could explain better than we could
[1:00:38] <%Bailey__gaming> @angriestpat i wish I could talk to you to help its hard to type
[1:00:38] <%realm_forge> HEED THESE WORDS
[1:00:39] <%Craytonex> the solstice is a 30 hour grind fest pat
[1:00:40] <rusho> Solstice lasts until the 27th, you have time
[1:00:42] <%Piemen99> !discord
[1:00:44] <pimpingpanda> someone go carry him thought the campaign
[1:00:47] <$valriot> @angriestpat Solstice is basically FFXIV Relic armour
[1:00:48] <+bigcomfyman> solstice can wait u got time and it's easier than last year
[1:00:49] <%Piemen99> !Discord
[1:00:50] <%Maids4lyfe> solstice lasts until the 27th
[1:00:51] <%dekkitout> Is the upgraded Solstice armor level restricted, I'm maxed so I wouldn't know?
[1:00:51] <Crushter> The Solstice stuff will be here for a few more weeks, the Forsaken plot and leveling only takes like, a few hours
[1:00:52] <+FennecZephyr> @AngriestPat Like, you 're trying to do engame stuff while you're still in Heavensward
[1:00:54] <fru1tycak3> Solstice is only relevant at Level Cap
[1:00:56] <%ghostfarts315> you need to get to at lvl 50
[1:00:58] <+FennecZephyr> To put it in 14 terms
[1:01:01] <%Reaped_Psyche> There is an armor step fpr the Solstice armor that requires grinding tons of the EAZ mini-bosses. So people are entering EAZ, killing mini bosses and leaving on the boss.
[1:01:06] <Segartner> oh no
[1:01:06] <%realm_forge> you have time to finish the solstice set
[1:01:07] <corrosivePaladin> whoever told you to do solsctice first is an idiot
[1:01:08] <%Craytonex> im doing my second set and it sucks
[1:01:10] <pimpingpanda> campaign can be done in a day
[1:01:14] <Segartner> he's going to rumble
[1:01:15] <+Ryan1016> It is for light levels not actual levels
[1:01:15] <%ArcanumMBD> It's a catch up if you're at CAP
[1:01:15] <SuperCress> What were those quests that gave like 690 armors?
[1:01:17] <Crushter> It's a catchup for light, not for levels
[1:01:17] <%ghostfarts315> then work on your light lvl later
[1:01:18] <fru1tycak3> because it's not
[1:01:21] <+Fynale> @AngriestPat it's a catch up for ppl that finished forsaken
[1:01:21] <HeySeuss> Do forsaken to get caught up to level and then do solstice
[1:01:21] <%Maids4lyfe> people are stupid pat
[1:01:24] <%realm_forge> ITS NOT
[1:01:24] <+bigcomfyman> it's one quest and gives u one of everything
[1:01:25] <%Maids4lyfe> it's not a catchup
[1:01:32] <+Ryan1016> QP is nice
[1:01:33] <pimpingpanda> level and light level is different
[1:01:33] <BlueSpartan119> item level vs character level
[1:01:33] <%ArcanumMBD> @AngriestPat It's like buying Scaevan gear with Poetics
[1:01:34] <%Maids4lyfe> just do story and things
[1:01:34] <Crushter> It is, kinda
[1:01:35] <%dekkitout> You don't have to campaign to level up
[1:01:35] <$afronooch> @AngriestPat Catch up quest requires forsaken completion
[1:01:42] <%pilgrimsayswhat> PEOPLE WITH FRIENDS
[1:01:42] <Russ0202> It doesn’t go away if you play Forsaken
[1:01:43] <MasterDecoder> ^
[1:01:44] <Crushter> it spoonfeeds you 750 LL gear
[1:01:44] <%realm_forge> WHOEVER TOLD YOU THAT LIED
[1:01:46] <Segartner> solstice is not good catchup If you're lvl 30
[1:01:48] <+bigcomfyman> itll bring u just before base power for all the BRAND NEW stuff
[1:01:50] <+purelyplum> the catch up mechanic is only for power lvl an post forsaken story
[1:01:51] <HeySeuss> It's a half catch up, you have to be max level, cause right now you are considered pre forsaken
[1:02:03] <+Foobe> EAZ =/= Catchup
[1:02:04] <+Ryan1016> @AngriestPat Forsaken is just the easiest way to get level 50 basically
[1:02:14] <pimpingpanda> finishing the campaign will get you close to 50 with 690 light level at the end
[1:02:15] <$afronooch> You can't tho, the robot man's dont got nothing to day say to you till you finish forsaken
[1:02:15] <IndoorSitup> 4Head 4Head 4Head 4Head
[1:02:19] <goroke> JUST RAISE YOUR CHARACTER LEVEL
[1:02:20] <%Maids4lyfe> no it's a GEAR NOT A LEVEL CATCHUP
[1:02:21] <+Delror> pat the catchup is for gear, not your level
[1:02:22] <Crushter> You opted out of the "skip mechanic"
[1:02:23] <fru1tycak3> because it's fucking not
[1:02:23] <IndoorSitup> 4Head 4Head 4Head
[1:02:23] <%SirGO0SE> its catchup FOR YOUR GEAR
[1:02:26] <Segartner> cuz it's not
[1:02:27] <%1Rayson> 1Rayson subscribed with Twitch Prime. They've subscribed for 8 months! Woo! almost time for the stream baby! I finally got to be around for one of your streams. timezone stuff usually never allows me to watch live, so thank fuck for VODs on youtube
[1:02:27] <+kingofbumbles> Cause of the BS XP level and light level nonsense
[1:02:27] <+Ryan1016> Basically do your MSQs then catch up to late game
[1:02:27] <goroke> AND YOUR POWER/ITEM LEVEL WILL CATCH UP
[1:02:29] <carzeri> pat there are two levels. your normal level and your light level. two different things
[1:02:30] <%realm_forge> it’s not catchup
[1:02:30] <+bigcomfyman> power level is the only thing that really matters
[1:02:30] <HeySeuss> So you have to be level 50
[1:02:35] <%dekkitout> It's catch up if you stopped at Forsaken stuff
[1:02:36] <Tryhardblackguy> will forsaken be free in the steam version?
[1:02:37] <%pilgrimsayswhat> Item Level V Character Level
[1:02:37] <%Bailey__gaming> @angriestpat it's light catchup not a level catch up
[1:02:41] <+angel949> there is character level and power level they are different
[1:02:42] <Caidezes> Chat is in shambles.
[1:02:46] <RevenantJoy> Light level is separate from character level. Essentially EAZ is catch up for light level only. You only benefit if you're already level 50.
[1:02:49] <Segartner> @tryhardblackguy no
[1:02:50] <%Maids4lyfe> sorry
[1:02:51] <QuasarKnightGaming> @angriestpat Solstice is to help people who already finished forsaken reach max Light Level. Finishing forsaken gets you 90% of the way to Level 50
[1:02:51] <+purelyplum> Cause hitting max lvl usually comes from general play an story play
[1:02:59] <MasterDecoder> @AngriestPat Level stops, Power = Number go up
[1:02:59] <Tryhardblackguy> @segartner damn
[1:03:01] <%Reaped_Psyche> It's a catch up mechanic for your Item Level not your basic level.
[1:03:01] <Crushter> @AngriestPat you play FF14, it's like your character level and your ilvl
[1:03:01] <%ElenaManetta> YEAH
[1:03:02] <sonofthedeepsouth> >dignity
[1:03:04] <+primax104> Omnishambles
[1:03:04] <%Roasted_Pheasant> banana pajama
[1:03:17] <+Fisk_Black_PSN> I know that banner, it means you were there when Crucible turned into Star Wars.
[1:03:18] <%NWR_James> hello
[1:03:21] <Neo_Kaiser> I hope Pat used to watch Space Cases
[1:03:21] <%SirGO0SE> whose talking
[1:03:22] <+Ryan1016> @AngriestPat Seems like you just need a good guide like you did with Warframe in the beginning
[1:03:23] <%AncelDeLambert> Paige go BED
[1:03:26] <Futurecity10> SHould I just buy the jump potion for all my crafters and gatherers?
[1:03:27] <Segartner> Phantom paige
[1:03:33] <+CommradeWolf> @AngriestPat Why did the dragonborn climb the seven thousand steps? He wanted to know what all the Fus was about!
[1:03:34] <MissionHillBlvd> hey pat what are the worse things Janeway has done?
[1:03:34] <%dekkitout> @Fisk_Black_PSN It was a good weekend
[1:03:36] <+bigcomfyman> punished paige
[1:03:38] <+Double_Tap_That> what is this insomnia stream
[1:03:48] <Russ0202> Yeah he read the thing
[1:03:51] <%AncelDeLambert> Pat's guide was called "Plague of Gripes"
[1:03:55] <+Ryan1016> Plague sort of helped you doing Plague star, it was a similar feeling to this solstice thing
[1:03:58] <Crushter> warframe's basically a straight arrow of progress
[1:04:03] <%Roasted_Pheasant> SCREAM
[1:04:04] <+Foobe> that's ture
[1:04:05] <%NWR_James> NO WE ARENT
[1:04:06] <Segartner> I think destiny is a bit more complicated than warframe in terms of where to go and what to do
[1:04:06] <MasterDecoder> PRETTY MUCH
[1:04:07] <%Roasted_Pheasant> apatElmo
[1:04:08] <SuperCress> LOUD NOISES
[1:04:08] <+Delror> no we aren't lol
[1:04:08] <$boxboten> hey so if Destiny 2 is going F2P and stadia+ is offering D2 as a free game then what the fuck is stadia+ supposed to be giving you
[1:04:09] <%Maids4lyfe> half the people here don't even like destiny
[1:04:10] <carzeri> IM NOT SCREAMING
[1:04:11] <%s_xylocalsingles> PLAY BANJO COWARD
[1:04:11] <SpaceGuntank> *incoherent screaming*
[1:04:12] <%salty_syd913> S C R E A M
[1:04:12] <Segartner> YES WE ARE
[1:04:12] <Valdorick> Cat would never be an asshole
[1:04:13] <pimpingpanda> no we are not
[1:04:13] <eiightbiitt> nakkiREE nakkiREE nakkiREE nakkiREE
[1:04:14] <+primax104> HI
[1:04:14] <QuasarKnightGaming> @angriestpat Solstice event is to help people who already finished forsaken reach max Light Level. Finishing forsaken gets you 90% of the way to Level 50. It is primarily here to help people get ready for the new raid.
[1:04:15] <Phalanx_Soul> do a barrel roll!
[1:04:16] <Valdorick> Chat*
[1:04:19] <IndoorSitup> L O U D N O I S E S
[1:04:20] <Zombrocom> I don't know anything about this game!
[1:04:22] <%Reaped_Psyche> The light level cap for Forsaken was 600. The catch up mechanics are to get you through the next 150 light that the "Season of" stuff would have gotten you.
[1:04:23] <%Roasted_Pheasant> apatCrazyhead
[1:04:27] <pimpingpanda> I have 2 set of gear now
[1:04:27] <%Piemen99> @AngriestPat Remember we area feeling not a advice givers
[1:04:28] <$afronooch> Quasar is spot on
[1:04:30] <+bigcomfyman> and ur one piece of advice here is do the campaign
[1:04:32] <+Fisk_Black_PSN> What if our advice is "Just do it" and "Git gud"? Which I think are your pieces of advice from Dark Souls?
[1:04:33] <%hussdogrob> you need one dedicated voice yelling one thing at you
[1:04:36] <BlueSpartan119> no
[1:04:37] <%Maids4lyfe> no
[1:04:38] <MasterDecoder> NO
[1:04:38] <+bigcomfyman> below max
[1:04:38] <%SirGO0SE> no
[1:04:39] <pimpingpanda> nope
[1:04:40] <+primax104> Ice Cream
[1:04:41] <%realm_forge> Forsaken =starmap
[1:04:41] <%Maids4lyfe> light is not level
[1:04:42] <%Reaped_Psyche> Noooooooooooo
[1:04:42] <+Ryan1016> Forsaken puts you at like 500 light
[1:04:42] <Segartner> nope
[1:04:43] <corrosivePaladin> no
[1:04:43] <$afronooch> nah
[1:04:46] <HeySeuss> But yeah, it's like ilevel and regular in FF14, you have to get to max level in normal levels before your ilevel starts progressing separately
[1:04:46] <%Piemen99> no
[1:04:47] <$valriot> Forsaken ends around 500
[1:04:48] <%Too_Much_Nukie> 600 to 750 is very different.
[1:04:49] <SuperCress> Naw, when I was level 50 I only had like level 500 something gear. Maybe I just sucked.
[1:04:51] <RevenantJoy> The max is raised every season
[1:04:51] <+Fynale> @AngriestPat no every dlc increased the max light
[1:04:52] <+FennecZephyr> If theyt did a lot of engame stuff, yeah
[1:04:54] <%dekkitout> Forsaken capped at 600, cap now is 750
[1:04:56] <%Reaped_Psyche> The light level cap for Forsaken was 600. The catch up mechanics are to get you through the next 150 light that the "Season of" stuff would have gotten you.
[1:04:56] <QuasarKnightGaming> No, they would be around 600
[1:04:58] <+Foobe> max light pushes up just a bit more.
[1:04:59] <Halfeatenoreo> that's exactly what the rest of his comment said
[1:04:59] <+bigcomfyman> max is 700 right now. it brings u to 640
[1:05:00] <+FennecZephyr> But a lot of peopole dont do engame stuff
[1:05:00] <$afronooch> for almost a year, lights gone up like 100 since then
[1:05:00] <Segartner> forsaken = 500 light
[1:05:02] <%NWR_James> oof
[1:05:02] <+angel949> forsaken max light is 600, new cap is 750
[1:05:07] <carzeri> no because the light level got increased with the dlc that came after
[1:05:08] <$boxboten> its like the ilevel diff between 4.0 and 4.5
[1:05:08] <SpaceGuntank> rekt
[1:05:09] <%realm_forge> Nope they raised it over the course of the year
[1:05:09] <%Roasted_Pheasant> Okay I'm incomprehensible and it's sleep time. Night y'all. Stay delicious.
[1:05:10] <goroke> You're catching up on Itemlevel
[1:05:10] <IntrepidEye> no. It slows a lot toward cap and they keep raising it
[1:05:11] <MasterDecoder> Power caps, gets raised each expansion @AngriestPat
[1:05:12] <Segartner> annual pass is 750 light max
[1:05:17] <Crushter> @AngriestPat Hey that "Do the Starmap" advice is what we're trying to tell you to do by telling you to play the campaign. Season of Opulence raised LL to 750, and Forsaken capped at 600
[1:05:17] <%dekkitout> Prior to the Solstice event, they could catch up to 690
[1:05:18] <%SirGO0SE> teammate "pregnant"
[1:05:22] <+bigcomfyman> nope
[1:05:23] <IndoorSitup> no
[1:05:24] <Halfeatenoreo> yes
[1:05:25] <%Piemen99> no
[1:05:25] <+Ryan1016> @AngriestPat No they're bringing people's powers up
[1:05:28] <pimpingpanda> finishing Forsaken will give you free gear for 690 light level
[1:05:29] <%dekkitout> October players can start at 750
[1:05:30] <Segartner> not really
[1:05:30] <IndoorSitup> maybe
[1:05:32] <+Delror> that's not what that means at all
[1:05:34] <+Fynale> @AngriestPat nope there'll be another lvl cap increase with shadowkeep
[1:05:34] <Russ0202> No
[1:05:34] <%NWR_James> LOOK AT US
[1:05:35] <%Bailey__gaming> Its a 100 plus difference between end of forsaken and now
[1:05:35] <+primax104> sipsipElmo sipsipElmo
[1:05:36] <%Roasted_Pheasant> apatJpeg
[1:05:37] <+Fisk_Black_PSN> You'll be laughably behind if you don't do Solstice because the armor sets are changing to 2.0 system. @AngriestPat
[1:05:37] <SuperCress> I'm not even doing the solstace stuff. I'm level 750. You'll be fine.
[1:05:38] <+sandwichtaker> keep looking at us anyways
[1:05:39] <+FennecZephyr> @AngriestPat no, they're have a new catch-up mission in october
[1:05:43] <IntrepidEye> still looking at chat
[1:05:45] <Segartner> D O G G O
[1:05:57] <+jwimz> Don’t need to do solstice
[1:05:58] <+Ryan1016> Solstice is mostly for the super dope armor
[1:05:59] <+Fynale> @AngriestPat with shadowkeep we'll be going from 50 to 70
[1:05:59] <baconlord38> No, solstice is pointless. I'm not even bothering with it this year.
[1:06:00] <%realm_forge> He had a shotgun there was nothing you could do lol
[1:06:01] <%axellogic> Theres no point in catching up unless you wanna be strong for a few days
[1:06:08] <+bigcomfyman> it's not legendary gear they give u so it sucks but u can get new rolls
[1:06:12] <corrosivePaladin> for the gold armor
[1:06:12] <+purelyplum> Solstice is just a fun even for armor that's purely visual with same perks as regular endgame armor.
[1:06:14] <+FennecZephyr> Cosmetics
[1:06:14] <%Reaped_Psyche> Solstice armor is cool.
[1:06:15] <+Ryan1016> @AngriestPat Cool armor with lights
[1:06:15] <%dekkitout> To 'get in early'
[1:06:16] <BlueSpartan119> cosmetics
[1:06:18] <HeySeuss> The solstice set gets the new armor changes come the new armor update while most year 2 armor won't
[1:06:19] <+angel949> no, the solstice armor is the first armor 2.0 that's coming in the next expansion
[1:06:19] <+bigcomfyman> it's for people who wants it
[1:06:20] <MasterDecoder> @AngriestPat Pretty Armor
[1:06:21] <Segartner> Cosmetics
[1:06:21] <Crushter> @AngriestPat Are you aware of "flex" content?
[1:06:26] <midgetzoo> Solstice gear is comparable to base gear for new expansion, think of it as having the weak version of the new stuff
[1:06:31] <+Fisk_Black_PSN> The Solstice armor is the first armor that will work with the new gear system
[1:06:32] <%realm_forge> Early access to the new armor mechanic
[1:06:33] <+Foobe> Solstice armor is cool and is the only armor to be converted to the newer armor system
[1:06:33] <+Fynale> @AngriestPat solstice has a tiny sparrow and the armor will work with the new armor system in shadowkeep
[1:06:35] <%NWR_James> Pregnant on team blue doin work
[1:06:35] <HeySeuss> Cosmetics and strong armor that will matter
[1:06:36] <+jwimz> For those who want to collect

[1:07:26] <SpaceGuntank> thats a bad idea lol
[1:07:26] <HeySeuss> It's because we are all giving him conflicting info

[1:07:34] <%salty_syd913> scream time
[1:07:34] <Segartner> put him back
[1:07:35] <+Foobe> please do!
[1:07:36] <%Piemen99> I have moobot
[1:07:36] <+Fynale> wait you took it off i thoguht it was still on and i was being careful not to

[1:07:41] <SomersaultJustice> LOUD NOISES
[1:07:42] <HoldBtoRun> LET'S ALL TYPE IN CAPS
[1:07:43] <$JJnAJjohnson> no ruin pls
[1:07:45] <$afronooch> @Ryan1016 i think so
[1:07:46] <%Too_Much_Nukie> Don't tell people it's off Pat NotLikeThis
[1:07:46] <Segartner> kill the screamers
[1:07:47] <goroke> Solstice is to get cool armor, the power gain = grind is not worth the time
[1:07:49] <Crushter> Who were you told this by
[1:07:53] <Crushter> because they're wrong
[1:07:53] <%hussdogrob> Yes I welcome the tyranny of our Bot of MOO
[1:07:54] <+Fynale> yeah that's about it
[1:08:00] <MasterDecoder> UGH
[1:08:00] <%dekkitout> What you said is correct
[1:08:01] <Crushter> You need 50 to get to max light
[1:08:01] <+Ryan1016> It lets you equip max light stuff and gets engrams yeah
[1:08:02] <reonome> I appreciate you turning it off pat :)
[1:08:04] <+Fynale> but you still have level requirements for gear
[1:08:05] <+Foobe> it's not incorrect, but it's not the only thing.
[1:08:05] <%Reaped_Psyche> Wow, that was misleading as fuck of them.
[1:08:06] <LeftOverPizza13> NOW I CAN RP AS MY FAVORITE BOY: KARKAT
[1:08:06] <corrosivePaladin> that is also wrong. levelcap will effect the max light you can use
[1:08:09] <fru1tycak3> @angriestpat it increases light cap
[1:08:10] <goroke> Character level is like all MMO where max level is good, but not worth as much as the item level
[1:08:10] <$afronooch> you need levels for higher light level
[1:08:11] <+purelyplum> Who personally in your friends group besides fuggins plays destiny that you talk to?
[1:08:14] <Segartner> yes, but levels allow you to use high light level gear
[1:08:21] <+jwimz> Level 50 is the beginning of endgame
[1:08:22] <pimpingpanda> @AngriestPat to wear gear above light level 500, you need to be at level 50
[1:08:23] <+bigcomfyman> normal levels don't matter it is just so you can't hyper boost a new character
[1:08:23] <%realm_forge> Character level gives you access to endgame gear and light level
[1:08:27] <HeySeuss> Whoever told you that was very misleading
[1:08:27] <RepMetal18> When you hit 50. You'll get Brights lvl up.
[1:08:27] <%ghostfarts315> lvl 50 allows you to put on better gear
[1:08:30] <ConLin_Arts_> Is this the PS4 or Xbox version?
[1:08:34] <%ghostfarts315> yup
[1:08:35] <BlueSpartan119> pc
[1:08:35] <%RubberFistFight> @AngriestPat Put moobot back. Honestly, for those of us who get carried away ONCE and accidentally set off the allcaps thing, we take our licks and deal with it - but for the shits who just keep spamming it, it's pretty damn effective at shooing them off.
[1:08:37] <%hussdogrob> it make the number go up
[1:08:37] <$afronooch> pc
[1:08:39] <ConLin_Arts_> ah
[1:08:43] <%Reevesypoo> Hey pat how are you liking destiny so far?
[1:08:45] <+Foobe> LUL
[1:08:45] <%NWR_James> BIG GUN
[1:08:46] <$Timesteel> new super
[1:08:46] <Segartner> First kill wooo
[1:08:46] <highfivepotater> lol
[1:08:47] <midgetzoo> After reaching cap, you earn bright engrams per "level"
[1:08:48] <goroke> That's the new Warlock arc super
[1:08:49] <%Reaped_Psyche> KAMEAMEAHHHH!!!
[1:08:50] <$afronooch> new super
[1:08:51] <Crushter> @AngriestPat the new lightning super from Forsaken
[1:08:51] <goroke> It's just Kamehameha
[1:08:51] <IntrepidEye> Better Warlock
[1:08:53] <$Timesteel> chaos reach
[1:08:53] <$Sdeje> kahmehameha
[1:08:53] <%dekkitout> Forsaken Warlock ult
[1:08:53] <+bigcomfyman> u get that from forsaken
[1:08:55] <ScreamLord> At least on PC Pat doesn't have to worry about the problem weapons...as much
[1:08:57] <$afronooch> which is why you should do forsaken
[1:08:57] <Crankthulhu> I can't believe I missed a 6v6 mode
[1:08:57] <+Fynale> @AngriestPat that's the warlocks new super that you get from forsaken
[1:08:57] <corrosivePaladin> that was a super locked behind forsaken
[1:08:57] <%SirGO0SE> he a firing HIS LAZOR
[1:09:02] <ConLin_Arts_> because and online FPS on PC with controller might be a bit slow?
[1:09:05] <$valriot> @angriestpat Think of it like FFXIV, you can level to 80, but you can't buy tome gear until you finish the story. Tome gear in this game being Powerful Gear.
[1:09:06] <+Bloko07> lol
[1:09:07] <Segartner> oh you have no idea, the new supers are amazing
[1:09:07] <Crankthulhu> How many PvP modes does Destiny 2 have?
[1:09:08] <Russ0202> once you hit max light and level up after that each time you get bright engram
[1:09:11] <+Ryan1016> Yeah I can definitely see that
[1:09:12] <DartonLance> similar idea to ff14 tomes changing tiers after patches to catch capped people up
[1:09:13] <HeySeuss> And that's why you should probably do forsaken, for the new supers
[1:09:13] <MasterDecoder> @AngriestPat I'm gonna tweet a bunch of stuff at you, the best info I can give Master Decoder/@CapnCroc
[1:09:15] <+WorldsBestPanda> It's 4 am. Do you know where YOUR BABY is?
[1:09:19] <IndoorSitup> someone should really get in contact with patrick and help his poor soul
[1:09:20] <ScreamLord> A lot changed with Foresaken
[1:09:21] <goroke> Just ignore everyone including this chat and get a single person to help you on Voice chat
[1:09:22] <QuasarKnightGaming> @angriestpat after a certain point, being level 30 will not drop ANY higher light level gear, and you won’t be able to equip any gear over that light level you do get. Levelling up increases your light level cap.
[1:09:24] <ConLin_Arts_> baby is next to him
[1:09:26] <+qreaper> how
[1:09:28] <%dekkitout> @Crankthulhu 8 or so, but they're all about the same
[1:09:30] <Segartner> Nova Warp is the shit @angriestpat
[1:09:31] <ConLin_Arts_> see there in the corner
[1:09:34] <ConLin_Arts_> babby
[1:09:35] <IntrepidEye> Did they buff the Titan big hammer?
[1:09:38] <HeySeuss> Yeah they don't do a good job of explaining things so I don't blame you there
[1:09:44] <$Timesteel> you just need to sit down with someone and have them explain stuff to you
[1:09:48] <Segartner> for that
[1:09:48] <%NWR_James> cuz now you got many guns
[1:09:48] <+FennecZephyr> @AngriestPat ...that's the old system. You always had two primaries
[1:09:49] <Crankthulhu> @dekkitout How many players each, give or take?
[1:09:51] <goroke> You can equip double primary, or even double special if you want
[1:09:52] <BlueSpartan119> green ammo is for shotguns snipers & fusion rifles
[1:09:54] <eiightbiitt> welcome to my world it's like me trying to get into warframe again
[1:09:55] <corrosivePaladin> green ammo is for shotguns/snipers
[1:09:55] <+Fynale> @AngriestPat green ammo is for shotguns and sniper rifles and some grenade launchers taht go in those slots now
[1:09:57] <%Reaped_Psyche> One is kinetic damage and one is energy damage. The last slot is heavy damage.
[1:10:04] <Segartner> special weapons, aka, shotguns, snipers, fusions
[1:10:04] <goroke> They increased the variety for you to mess around with
[1:10:05] <Crushter> @AngriestPat Green is for Shotguns, Snipers, Fusions, etc
[1:10:06] <+bigcomfyman> there are three ammo types u have reserves for each. green is elemental.
[1:10:08] <+Ryan1016> @AngriestPat Weapon system is kinetic weapon with no elements, energy weapon has the 3 elements, and power weapons
[1:10:09] <%ghostfarts315> that was from the forsaken update
[1:10:12] <ScreamLord> @AngriestPat Green ammo is for Shotguns, Snipers, and single-shot Grenade Launchers
[1:10:12] <IntrepidEye> Green ammo is for shotguns, sniper rifles something else i forgot
[1:10:14] <%Piemen99> @IntrepidEye No
[1:10:16] <RepMetal18> Green is for Specials. Like Snipers,Shotties. etc. @AngriestPat
[1:10:17] <%dekkitout> There's 6v6, 2v2, 6 person free for all, 4v4, and 3v3 might come back
[1:10:17] <strudelhime> green ammo weapons do more damage but you have less of it
[1:10:20] <$Timesteel> green is for shotguns, fusions, snipers, and some grenande launchers
[1:10:21] <+Foobe> there's a lot to cover, a lot more than chat can cover effectively
[1:10:23] <+Fynale> @AngriestPat so like your old shotguns and stuff go into the primary slots now
[1:10:24] <+jwimz> Green ammo for snipes, shotguns, fusion and grenade launchers
[1:10:25] <fru1tycak3> @angriestpat Special "Green" Ammo is stronger, I.e Shotguns, Snipers etc.
[1:10:26] <%Reaped_Psyche> Green is just rared to balance out the powerful stuff you can use in variuous slots./
[1:10:26] <+Fynale> and they use green ammo
[1:10:27] <HeySeuss> Green ammo is special ammo, found to the weapons that got relocated, ie snipers, shotguns, fusion rifles, grenade launchers and trace rifles
[1:10:29] <+angel949> it's for snipers,shotguns,fusions,and some grenade launchers
[1:10:29] <%ElenaManetta> I'm weirded out by this Pat who hasn't researched all stat info in a multiplayer game and can go as far as telling everyone the percentages of mechanics
[1:10:29] <+SuperiorDelta> @AngriestPat They did that because they wanted to give players the chance to run whatever they wanted including tree shotguns, their words
[1:10:31] <%Kirby_Sauce> Green is for the mid power weapons
[1:10:35] <$afronooch> cheer100 Weapons are now Primary, Special, and Heavy. White is for primary, green is for special, purple for heavy
[1:10:37] <Crushter> You seriously need a helper at this point, and chat is worthless for doing it rapidly
[1:10:37] <pimpingpanda> @AngriestPat energy weapon is for breaking shield
[1:10:39] <+purelyplum> They converted the weapon system back to destiny 1 format, green ammo is for specials weapons like snipers an shotguns
[1:10:39] <strudelhime> you can equip as many green weapons as you want, but then you can run out of ammo
[1:10:44] <Zebroneath> Late night, huh?
[1:10:44] <$Timesteel> yes
[1:10:45] <%ArcanumMBD> Yep
[1:10:46] <%Piemen99> yes
[1:10:47] <%Reaped_Psyche> No
[1:10:48] <ScreamLord> Yes
[1:10:48] <+FennecZephyr> Yes
[1:10:48] <%Maids4lyfe> ys
[1:10:48] <+Ryan1016> Sort of yes
[1:10:48] <Segartner> yep
[1:10:49] <+bigcomfyman> u run two of the same ammo types you have less ammo overall
[1:10:49] <BlueSpartan119> yes
[1:10:49] <IntrepidEye> yep
[1:10:50] <%realm_forge> Green ammo is for shotguns, snipers, and fusion rifles. Your burst damage weapons that hit a bit herder than your primary types
[1:10:51] <$Sdeje> most of them
[1:10:52] <%SirGO0SE> bingo
[1:10:52] <IndoorSitup> maybe
[1:10:54] <pimpingpanda> not really
[1:10:54] <HeySeuss> These are stronger than normal weapons like assault rifles, thus having a more limited resource
[1:10:56] <+angel949> yes
[1:10:56] <+Ryan1016> It's a very flexible system
[1:10:58] <Segartner> most of them yeah
[1:10:59] <+Ryan1016> Yes
[1:11:00] <+Fynale> yes
[1:11:01] <$Timesteel> except some are also in the primary slot
[1:11:01] <%Piemen99> yup
[1:11:02] <%dekkitout> Yep
[1:11:02] <IntrepidEye> yes
[1:11:03] <%SirGO0SE> nailing it
[1:11:03] <+bigcomfyman> no
[1:11:03] <$afronooch> yep
[1:11:04] <+Ryan1016> Double primary is very niche
[1:11:06] <Segartner> yeah
[1:11:09] <IntrepidEye> bows are good man
[1:11:11] <%realm_forge> And then added even cooler weapons in the heavy slot
[1:11:13] <Crushter> who the hell uses Wish Ender
[1:11:13] <+FennecZephyr> Yeah, this system allows for kinetic special weapons
[1:11:14] <%Bloko07> @AngriestPat have you played through forsaken yet?
[1:11:14] <$Sdeje> You can for example run a shotgun on every slot now
[1:11:16] <+jwimz> Yep
[1:11:17] <corrosivePaladin> That bow can see you through walls Pat
[1:11:20] <%SirGO0SE> yo bows seem sick as fuck
[1:11:20] <+Foobe> @Crushter Me
[1:11:23] <Segartner> pat is getting farmed. I love it
[1:11:26] <Crushter> @Foobe mad lad
[1:11:26] <+Fynale> @AngriestPat they also then added a new special only weapon in the machine gun
[1:11:31] <BlueSpartan119> secondarys can be in either slot, kinetic or energy
[1:11:32] <HeySeuss> Energy is for shield popping, kinetic is just mowing down enemies
[1:11:33] <StarsCrusader> Shoot the guy, Pat
[1:11:33] <%hussdogrob> @bloko07 he has not
[1:11:33] <+Foobe> and the Oathkeepers too Kappa
[1:11:33] <pimpingpanda> lol 3 shotgun build?
[1:11:34] <IntrepidEye> shotguns can be infuriating though
[1:11:34] <HeySeuss> So yes
[1:11:35] <+bigcomfyman> you can have two kin or energy you will just have less ammo for them
[1:11:42] <SpaceGuntank> "Caps lock is cruise control for cool, but even then you still have to steer"
[1:11:47] <ScreamLord> @AngriestPat Kinetics do more base damage but a matched energy weapons chew through shields and makes them explode
[1:11:49] <Crushter> They probably assumed you were at 50 @AngriestPat
[1:11:50] <%SirGO0SE> need to transfer my thousands of hanzo hours over to d2 and rek
[1:11:53] <Segartner> they are dirty liara
[1:11:53] <+FennecZephyr> They probably thought you played more than you had
[1:11:53] <%Reaped_Psyche> I'm not sure if you can finish the Solstice stuff if you're not at Level 50.
[1:11:55] <HeySeuss> Secondary ammo and energy weapons are very different
[1:11:57] <%Too_Much_Nukie> I think people on twitter assumed you were level 50.
[1:11:58] <Segartner> liars
[1:11:59] <%Craytonex> they probably assumed you were max level
[1:12:02] <carzeri> pat has twitter ever been right
[1:12:02] <+jwimz> They are wrong.
[1:12:05] <%pilgrimsayswhat> pilgrimsayswhat subscribed at Tier 1. They've subscribed for 17 months! #TeamSpaceWizard
[1:12:06] <$afronooch> i think you listened to that one wrong person pat
[1:12:07] <%Piemen99> TBh i think twiiter people didnt know that you were so far back
[1:12:07] <%ElenaManetta> People in chat and people on Twitter are virtually the same
[1:12:07] <+Ryan1016> @AngriestPat I think those people were under the impression you'd want it for the cool armor? You can definitely hit max light if you play a lot but like idk
[1:12:08] <+bigcomfyman> by doing the catchup quest
[1:12:08] <%realm_forge> They wanted you to have access to the new armor system right off the bat in October
[1:12:08] <ConLin_Arts_> SpaceJam is strong
[1:12:09] <+Foobe> they absolutely assumed you were at LVL 50
[1:12:10] <Russ0202> Think of it as slot 1 (kinetic) slot 2 (Energy) slot 3 (Power)
[1:12:12] <highfivepotater> @AngriestPat you can
[1:12:15] <pimpingpanda> I think to grind for the blue armor you will need to be at least 50
[1:12:16] <+Fynale> @AngriestPat cuz people dont' read
[1:12:16] <corrosivePaladin> Because twitter is dumb
[1:12:17] <%Reaped_Psyche> Because they're dumb.
[1:12:18] <$valriot> Twitter people are fucking dumb, but probably didn't know you hadn't even done Warmind, let alone Forsaken
[1:12:19] <ScreamLord> @AngriestPat Because people are dumb Pat
[1:12:19] <+bigcomfyman> cuz they're dumb
[1:12:21] <CherrieVelvet> people are dumb
[1:12:21] <Crushter> because big stupid
[1:12:21] <%Piemen99> Twitter dumb
[1:12:22] <Segartner> they are dumb
[1:12:23] <reonome> people can't read
[1:12:24] <%dekkitout> Because we all forgot about leveling...
[1:12:25] <$Timesteel> because they're dumb
[1:12:31] <+Ryan1016> @AngriestPat Getting to level 50 takes about the length of forsaken which is about 8 hours I think
[1:12:40] <%dekkitout> No one remembers chain farming public event on Nessus
[1:12:46] <IntrepidEye> I think most of your deaths have been to shottys
[1:12:56] <Zedimonx5> Man maybe it’s because I just woke up but Warframe looks weird
[1:13:00] <Crushter> Seriously does he have like a friend who knows the game well who can just spoonfeed the mechanical half end
[1:13:03] <ConLin_Arts_> yay
[1:13:05] <ConLin_Arts_> got one
[1:13:07] <RepMetal18> Yes, But the Special can be Kinetic or Energy. Its ammo pool is seperate from the White primary ammo which is for regular guns. Most of the changes made to the game in forsaken are to be similar to D1. @AngriestPat
[1:13:09] <%Reaped_Psyche> That was kinda sick pat.
[1:13:19] <+purelyplum> Watching you get misinformation shoveled at you to make you so confused to not wanna bother playing is baffling to see.
[1:13:24] <+RadSuit> I thought this notification was a mistake.
[1:13:25] <%realm_forge> They assumed because post forsaken and level 50 players are “the norm”
[1:13:29] <%superc37> superc37 subscribed at Tier 1. They've subscribed for 15 months! 15 months huh? well, to borrow one of the dumbest quotes I've heard, "destiny's destiny." happy 15 months dude, and have fun playing the sequel to the game that made me loose faith in bungie!
[1:13:29] <Segartner> that was kinda sick
[1:13:31] <IndoorSitup> worst advice
[1:13:31] <MasterDecoder> DAMN IT DK
[1:13:31] <Crushter> that's hilarious
[1:13:33] <SpaceGuntank> when is pat going to start 360 no-scoping people?
[1:13:35] <MartiusGW> to be fair weapons system is stupid in both density
[1:13:36] <MasterDecoder> FUCK
[1:13:44] <%ghostfarts315> that's mean
[1:13:52] <%ElenaManetta> Literally setting you up to fail
[1:13:52] <IndoorSitup> that is a bad man
[1:13:58] <Segartner> @spaceguntank when he gets a sniper
[1:13:58] <ConLin_Arts_> maybe you should have one someone you know mentor you through the base stuff?
[1:13:59] <+Ryan1016> PvP god Pat
[1:14:08] <RepMetal18> *Avenges Pregnant*
[1:14:10] <Crushter> man will people ever get over Destiny the OG butthurt about Destiny
[1:14:12] <%pilgrimsayswhat> I hate when super but far
[1:14:13] <+Foobe> you basically carried your team, Pat
[1:14:16] <IntrepidEye> Welcome to being a Titan everyday
[1:14:27] <MasterDecoder> IGNORE
[1:14:29] <Crushter> just don't worry about it
[1:14:30] <HeySeuss> Super but far make number go down
[1:14:36] <+SamSoulesque> Pat~ this is a Massege from the Future *making spooky noises* Whenever you say:"why did ppl tell my XYZ then?" the Answer is Simple: Humans are Stupid.
[1:14:37] <+Ryan1016> @AngriestPat It boosts you past Year 1 and let's you go right into forsaken campaign
[1:14:38] <+Fynale> @AngriestPat the boost is for alts to get past the base campaign and go into forsaken
[1:14:38] <%dekkitout> 30? Wasn't there one for 50 too?
[1:14:43] <MasterDecoder> Those boosts cost A LOT
[1:14:45] <Segartner> 30 is the starting level for forsaken
[1:14:46] <ConLin_Arts_> Helmet :0
[1:14:47] <ItIsSky> I believe the boost is for those who want to start forsaken
[1:14:48] <$Timesteel> boost is so you can start forsaken on an alt
[1:14:49] <+Ryan1016> @AngriestPat It's for alt chars
[1:14:50] <OBS_VinnieK> that is because tis the Boosts for Forsaken
[1:14:51] <fru1tycak3> @angriestpat Boost to Lv 30 with 330 Gear equipped
[1:14:54] <+FennecZephyr> Wasn't there a 50 boost too>
[1:14:57] <OBS_VinnieK> it puts you are 30 so you can do Forsaken
[1:14:58] <Zebroneath> I think you can boost to 30 with Forsaken
[1:15:07] <Segartner> you did good pat
[1:15:13] <ScreamLord> @AngriestPat You get 1 free boost to 30 and the others cost money
[1:15:16] <RepMetal18> Boost skips the Red war campaign for characters who haven't completed it. @AngriestPat
[1:15:17] <SuperCress> Damn, I still play this game @ max level and Pat does better than me in Crucible. Wack
[1:15:21] <%Reaped_Psyche> What you should do depends on what you want to get out of the game. Do you want the shiny armor? Solstice will get you there... eventually. The grind will be intense though. If you want to get stronk and viable for doing more content, get to level 50 and do the story stuff.
[1:15:22] <gps309> you did it
[1:15:26] <BlueSpartan119> yeah, that's if you made a fresh character
[1:15:30] <+Fynale> @AngriestPat for alts that are level 1
[1:15:32] <Crushter> to start Forsaken on that character
[1:15:33] <$afronooch> to skip base campaign
[1:15:35] <+bigcomfyman> to bring them to forsaken level
[1:15:35] <SpaceGuntank> its for fresh new characters
[1:15:37] <%Craytonex> tbh a big problem of destiny is that you're gonna spend alot of time looking at guides rather than figuring stufd on your own because of how abstract some of the wording is
[1:15:38] <MasterDecoder> It's for Fresh, don't do it
[1:15:39] <Crushter> just read the text
[1:15:43] <JamboLovePanda> that's to boost you to be ready to start the forsaken campaign
[1:15:43] <+Ryan1016> To just skip warmind, most people didn't have that much progress on 3 chars if they quit
[1:15:43] <$Timesteel> to skip to forsake pretty much
[1:15:44] <%Maids4lyfe> it's for fresh characters only
[1:15:44] <Segartner> because your characters are lvl 25
[1:15:45] <ItIsSky> it's to skip to forsaken
[1:15:45] <+bigcomfyman> to skip the worse dlcs
[1:15:46] <MartiusGW> thats for skipping content you paid for
[1:15:49] <fru1tycak3> @angriestpat why is it just your warlock???
[1:15:52] <$ESP_ROOT> :)
[1:15:53] <ConLin_Arts_> like the FF14 books?
[1:15:55] <Crushter> no on the orb
[1:15:56] <+angel949> for your 2nd or 3rd character if you don't wanna do the campaign grind again
[1:15:57] <%realm_forge> So you can gain access to forsaken
[1:15:57] <+Ryan1016> Most people would just be skipping ALL year 1 and not just Warmind for you
[1:15:59] <goroke> Hover over the item
[1:16:04] <Crushter> read the ORB
[1:16:13] <+Foobe> OH MAN, pat you have the pvp god chest armor for titan
[1:16:17] <+Ryan1016> It's just if you dont want to run the campaign again
[1:16:18] <+Foobe> you have good taste
[1:16:21] <Fubberknucked> yes because usually u start at 1 its a boost to 30 and bypasses the pre forsaken dlc's
[1:16:23] <%dekkitout> It gets you to Forsaken's minimum level requirement
[1:16:24] <SuperCress> I think skipping to endgame content means just having the stuff done to actually play Forsaken
[1:16:26] <EpslionBear> its for people who got forsaken but don't want to play y1 stuff
[1:16:28] <MasterDecoder> All Story, Do not
[1:16:28] <%realm_forge> Man right fuck that warmind was cool
[1:16:29] <%Maids4lyfe> it skips warmind
[1:16:29] <Crushter> It skips everything pre-forsaken
[1:16:31] <+Ryan1016> Red War, CoS, and Warmind campaigns
[1:16:32] <Crushter> that's pretty clear
[1:16:32] <$ESP_ROOT> what itll skipped
[1:16:33] <$afronooch> Red war osiris and warmind
[1:16:38] <$Sdeje> Warmind is only like 3 hours
[1:16:41] <+bigcomfyman> it doesn't skip anything it gives you the ability to skip if you want
[1:16:41] <+Fynale> @AngriestPat it'll skip all of teh base campaign, curse of osiris, and warmind
[1:16:44] <Segartner> @angriestpat it says "to skip to the start of the forsaken campaing"
[1:16:45] <ShadowNovaDez> how is this hard to understand?
[1:16:45] <%dekkitout> I'm not sure, however, if ti auto completes Warmind/Osiris' stories
[1:16:53] <+bigcomfyman> you can go back
[1:16:57] <ScreamLord> All of the story missions up to Forsaken is skipped
[1:17:00] <HeySeuss> It skips year one DLC aka Curse of Osiris, Warmind and Base Game
[1:17:01] <ItIsSky> it skips main story and the two dlc story packs before the forsaken expansion
[1:17:02] <bruno_silv0> pretty sure you can go back to play the content if you want
[1:17:02] <%Maids4lyfe> Forsaken is AFTER all that
[1:17:02] <%pilgrimsayswhat> It’s vague
[1:17:04] <TubesockCommando> It doesn't skip anything story/event related, it's a level boost flat out
[1:17:04] <+bigcomfyman> but you shouldn't want to
[1:17:04] <Segartner> it means everything before forsaken gets skipped
[1:17:06] <+angel949> its says please be advised it will skip content
[1:17:06] <acecondeuce> It does if you acquire it @AngriestPat
[1:17:07] <MasterDecoder> IT's super not clear
[1:17:08] <%Jay_Squirrel> i had to dip for a sec, did he win yet?
[1:17:08] <$afronooch> Advance to the start of the Forsaken campaign = skip everything until Forsaken you silly goose
[1:17:08] <fru1tycak3> @angriestpat Skips all Year 1 Content, sadly you can't still play those missions
[1:17:08] <+d00msdaydan> you can go back and play the old campaigns, you'll just be able to jump straight into forsaken
[1:17:09] <ConLin_Arts_> maybe every campain is in order?
[1:17:10] <CyborgAV> Pat it's a Shadowbringers jump book
[1:17:10] <%Reaped_Psyche> It doesn't saty if it skips leveling or if it removes the questlines.
[1:17:14] <%wsintai> It's clearly vague
[1:17:18] <acecondeuce> Because it goes to a different screen
[1:17:19] <+FennecZephyr> @AngriestPat I think it will let you go back and do Warmind, but it;s been a while
[1:17:21] <Zebroneath> The displayed message is vague.
[1:17:22] <JamboLovePanda> that is not clear enough for someone who has been away from the game for a while
[1:17:23] <%hussdogrob> assume it skips everything preforsaken
[1:17:24] <%Cthulos> 2
[1:17:26] <%realm_forge> It’s dumb and for the weak. Ignore it
[1:17:26] <acecondeuce> Because it gives you a warning screen
[1:17:31] <IndoorSitup> man i dont even play destiny and i have no fucken idea what is even happening right now im so lost
[1:17:35] <+Ryan1016> It's super not clear playing NOW but when it came out that's all the content there was so it was a /bit/ more clear?
[1:17:37] <+Fynale> @AngriestPat they didn't think over the boost very well it's probably an activision addition
[1:17:42] <ScreamLord> @AngriestPat Just ignore it
[1:17:44] <+Foobe> well, it's clear now, right?
[1:17:45] <+bigcomfyman> it doesn't force a skip it lets you choose to go
[1:17:46] <ConLin_Arts_> seems to mostly be for alts
[1:17:47] <fru1tycak3> @angriestpat you have to confirm it twice
[1:17:48] <+Ryan1016> ARE YOU SUPER SURE?
[1:17:51] <+Ryan1016> LUL
[1:17:52] <rusho> So what does pat WANT to do?
[1:17:56] <Zedimonx5> So is this still “it’s good now”?
[1:17:56] <SpaceGuntank> are you DOUBLE sure?
[1:17:58] <Crushter> You just knowingly listed all the information about how it would be clear? It skips all content up to Forsaken, point blank
[1:17:58] <%Craytonex> its to help level alts
[1:18:02] <%dekkitout> How bout we scrap it all and wait till October where you start at 750 SeriousSloth
[1:18:04] <+RadSuit> It's a bad game, Pat.
[1:18:04] <ConLin_Arts_> red gun :0
[1:18:07] <%Jay_Squirrel> but its fine cause year one is garbo
[1:18:07] <+Ryan1016> It's like ending e from automata
[1:18:12] <MasterDecoder> @rusho Solstice, but also story
[1:18:14] <FreeFuzeIcedTea> I'm not sure why anyone's acting like he's stupid on this, he's been away and the wording is super vague and bad
[1:18:15] <%Cthulos> It says right there it may skip over campaigns Pat
[1:18:20] <+angel949> it asks you like 3 times if u wanna use it for sure and gives more info beforehand
[1:18:21] <+Fynale> @AngriestPat oh and btw they moved the coldheart(the laser beam gun) to energy weapon slot
[1:18:24] <%ElenaManetta> Gungeon is the only game with a lot of mechanics I can play without a wikia open on the side, honestly
[1:18:26] <BlueSpartan119> so... he should do warmind to level up?
[1:18:32] <%Niney_Who> Niney_Who subscribed at Tier 1. They've subscribed for 8 months, currently on a 8 month streak! I'd like to let you know that Killing Floor 2 is adding a Syringe Bat and a High-Frequency Blade to their game.
[1:18:36] <%Piemen99> nothign
[1:18:37] <Crushter> You would start it
[1:18:38] <+bigcomfyman> nothing
[1:18:39] <+SuperiorDelta> Nothing
[1:18:39] <+Foobe> you'll just do it
[1:18:40] <MasterDecoder> IT starts it
[1:18:40] <rusho> Then Story--->solstice would be the ideal order
[1:18:42] <+Fynale> @AngriestPat it'll just start the forsaken quests
[1:18:43] <Segartner> nothing
[1:18:44] <fru1tycak3> @angriestpat nothing
[1:18:44] <ScreamLord> Nothing
[1:18:44] <$Sdeje> you start
[1:18:44] <BlueSpartan119> you can got back to warmind later
[1:18:45] <%Jay_Squirrel> youll do it
[1:18:45] <+bigcomfyman> warmind will still be there
[1:18:46] <$afronooch> It starts forsaken campaign
[1:18:46] <$Timesteel> nothing you can still do warmind
[1:18:46] <+FennecZephyr> You just go
[1:18:48] <%wsintai> Pat you should know good and well that we're all fucking stupid and unhelpful at best
[1:18:51] <$afronooch> you can still do warmind
[1:18:51] <+bigcomfyman> it will always be there
[1:18:56] <$Sdeje> it's fairly independent story wise
[1:18:57] <Segartner> warming will still be there
[1:18:59] <+bigcomfyman> you can just not
[1:19:00] <%Maids4lyfe> they do
[1:19:03] <Crushter> Because they want you to skip to the stuff people liked
[1:19:03] <Segartner> they do
[1:19:04] <ScreamLord> @AngriestPat because shut up
[1:19:05] <$afronooch> you can tho
[1:19:05] <+FennecZephyr> I doesnt skip them
[1:19:09] <fru1tycak3> @angriestpat what?
[1:19:10] <+bigcomfyman> it doesn't force a skip
[1:19:10] <+Fynale> @AngriestPat the DLC's are independent stories from the main campaign
[1:19:12] <Crushter> and forget about the stuff people had problems with
[1:19:16] <+Ryan1016> @AngriestPat So you can do the endgame missions on mercury and mars if you want the sleeper simulant for example, it's super not clear tho
[1:19:18] <Murphio_GS> Hey pat, you playing a shit game???
[1:19:21] <+purelyplum> Nothing you can just do that story if you want but it doesnt remove the older content you can just do them out of order
[1:19:22] <JamboLovePanda> don't try and make sense of it, it doesnt
[1:19:23] <+bigcomfyman> you can choose to ignore them
[1:19:24] <MasterDecoder> IT SKIPS, FUCK OFF CHAT
[1:19:25] <IndoorSitup> i do not play destiny i am so lost but so is pat and maybe chat and im loving it
[1:19:26] <BlueSpartan119> the BOOST skips them
[1:19:26] <ConLin_Arts_> the level skip skips
[1:19:31] <+d00msdaydan> YOU CAN STILL PLAY THE, YOU CAN JUST ALSO DO THE NEW SHIT RIGHT NOW
[1:19:31] <%superc37> pat just play warframe
[1:19:31] <+purelyplum> The lol boost skips them
[1:19:33] <+Fynale> @AngriestPat warmind is like a side quest
[1:19:33] <Segartner> LUL
[1:19:35] <ScreamLord> @AngriestPat It skips the story missions
[1:19:35] <%Maids4lyfe> @AngriestPat no it makes you high enough level to choose to skip
[1:19:37] <+goodfeila> sbfpSetIn sbfpSetIn sbfpSetIn
[1:19:38] <corrosivePaladin> It skips the main campain and sets you to lv30. It doesnt touch the dlc
[1:19:38] <SuperCress> You'll skip it in the sense this is a grindhouse of a game. You'll just lose context of story. You'll do literally EVERYTHING in the game over and over again because thats how its made.
[1:19:39] <+jwimz> It’s your dlc, play it when you want to.
[1:19:40] <SpaceGuntank> everyone in chat is probably sleep deprived
[1:19:44] <%Jay_Squirrel> chat is fuckin stupid. it skips all year one content
[1:19:45] <+RadSuit> Just play Warframe instead, that game always makes perfect sense and has very clear in game instructions.
[1:19:48] <+Fynale> @AngriestPat you don't need to do warmind to do forsaken you only have to be lvl 30
[1:19:49] <%ghostfarts315> @angriestpat just play forsaken story. you can go back if you choose do later
[1:19:50] <%Craytonex> warmind is like a side quest that last like 3 hours tops
[1:19:52] <goroke> The skip is the level boost you mentioned before
[1:19:53] <%dekkitout> It doesn't auto-complete, the boosts put you at minimum to start level it seems
[1:19:55] <+Foobe> LUL
[1:19:57] <JamboLovePanda> for real though, chat you're all saying different things stop confusing the man
[1:19:57] <%Piemen99> sbfpSetIn sbfpSetIn sbfpSetIn sbfpSetIn sbfpSetIn
[1:19:58] <%Maids4lyfe> it's optional skip
[1:19:59] <$boxboten> @SpaceGuntank or australian
[1:20:02] <+Ryan1016> Oh man oh man
[1:20:02] <+angel949> pat please just look up a guide or something
[1:20:03] <Futurecity10> WAKE ME UP
[1:20:04] <FreeFuzeIcedTea> This chat is the most unhelpful shit LOL
[1:20:04] <$boxboten> either way theyre shitposting
[1:20:06] <%Niney_Who> Please stop confusing pat
[1:20:08] <Crushter> Man you asked, we're just telling you that it allows you to ignore Year 1
[1:20:09] <MartiusGW> i cant to see if new light will be bigger mess
[1:20:09] <carzeri> :D
[1:20:10] <$Dutchpotato> why can't chat just give a straight answer NotLikeThis
[1:20:10] <%Maids4lyfe> you don't have to skip, you can choose to play the content anyways
[1:20:11] <+Ryan1016> Pat is hurting
[1:20:19] <+Hmkks> I played Destiny II's story when it launched, and don't remember anything at all anymore.
[1:20:20] <%Reaped_Psyche> The game's not that bad on this stuff. Chat/Twitter is just insane and babbling gibberish.
[1:20:20] <+FennecZephyr> Maybe we should just look it up
[1:20:21] <JamboLovePanda> I feel like we need someone who ACTUALLY knows what's going on to do a big write up
[1:20:21] <MasterDecoder> @AngriestPat I'm gonna stop watching and compose Tweets to help you
[1:20:24] <corrosivePaladin> Chat is pretty dumb
[1:20:24] <KaseKaizer> 4
[1:20:26] <%hussdogrob> @futurecity10 Cant wake up
[1:20:26] <%wsintai> @AngriestPat It's King Crimson
[1:20:27] <%Niney_Who> TIMESKIP
[1:20:28] <%supersugoisenpai1> Thanks chat
[1:20:29] <IndoorSitup> ive just been drinking a bit, excuse my shit
[1:20:31] <Romantic_Legion> I did this with a friend, it will skip the campaign.
[1:20:32] <ConLin_Arts_> If I understand correctly you can play them with the right Level, but the boost that boost you so you can play the latest one while skipping the previous ones
[1:20:32] <%Maids4lyfe> NotLikeThis
[1:20:34] <bruno_silv0> you can always go back to play the content, but id advise you to play the campaigns from release order
[1:20:36] <Zedimonx5> TIMESKIP
[1:20:36] <+cahv123> Yes. Welcome to dumb shit the game.
[1:20:37] <Segartner> it's confusing as fuxk
[1:20:38] <+bigcomfyman> when people say skip things they're being dumb. the thing doesn't go away. you can choose to ignore it
[1:20:40] <+angel949> can someone get Datto on the line?
[1:20:40] <Romantic_Legion> Don't do it.
[1:20:42] <+d00msdaydan> @AngriestPat if you eat the jump potion you will be able to play forsaken OR go back and do warmind
[1:20:43] <%Niney_Who> The truth will NEVER REACH YOU
[1:20:44] <Dio_TR> eyyyyy I finished glow glad to see Pat is going more insane
[1:20:46] <SuperCress> Skip in this sense means you won't have to do it immediately to progress. You can still do every mission whenever you want, really.
[1:20:46] <Russ0202> What do you exactly want to do ?
[1:20:47] <%Gray_skies1993> man this is a deep window into how the spread of misinformation can lead to confusion among people
[1:20:48] <+SuperiorDelta> @AngriestPat When you start you do the main story which gets you to level for Curse than Curse gets you up to Warmind and Warmind gets you up to Forsaken but that item makes you a high enough level to just play Forsaken's content
[1:20:48] <+Fynale> @AngriestPat warframe is clearer than destiny at times
[1:20:49] <SilentxSilver> it doesn't skip anything it just boost you so you can play forsaken but you can play any dlc at anytime in any order you want
[1:20:53] <IndoorSitup> i think chat has been drinking too
[1:20:54] <Segartner> look man, @angriestpat just do forsaken
[1:20:57] <Halfeatenoreo> it will skip the main campaign but nothing else
[1:20:58] <Zombrocom> @AngriestPat Unfortunatly, we are in fact 750 people
[1:20:59] <%Kazooki_Kazami> as a person who only played through the vanilla im also just as confused as pat
[1:21:00] <%Reaped_Psyche> The campaign happens, but the campaign is removed by KING CRIMSON
[1:21:01] <+BossPlayerOG> Just play the game in order, stop trying to minmax progress
[1:21:04] <%Jay_Squirrel> just do it and see for yourself
[1:21:05] <Romantic_Legion> don't do it
[1:21:11] <seycheles> big randos
[1:21:13] <ConLin_Arts_> Baby
[1:21:15] <ConLin_Arts_> skrem
[1:21:16] <+bigcomfyman> there was devnotes and that's it
[1:21:16] <%salty_syd913> ooh elmo screm
[1:21:17] <$afronooch> he screm
[1:21:19] <+Fynale> @AngriestPat there was a pop up when forsaken came out but not now
[1:21:20] <+Foobe> oh yeah, i might be part of the larger dumb chat, but when they first changed the weapons around, they put out a message about it
[1:21:20] <+Ryan1016> Yeah it was only in marketing shit not in game
[1:21:26] <+Foobe> that was only once and that was about it
[1:21:27] <%dekkitout> There probably was when the updates first came out
[1:21:28] <%Jay_Squirrel> there was i think but it was almost a year ago
[1:21:28] <$valriot> This is all stuff that happened 1-2 years ago @angriestpat
[1:21:30] <chronoxgp> look at this secret NEET stream
[1:21:30] <Romantic_Legion> I highly recommend not doing it.
[1:21:34] <$Sdeje> I think there were notices when the changes first happened, but that was it
[1:21:40] <goroke> Because it uses special ammo
[1:21:41] <%Maids4lyfe> how is it confusing?
[1:21:41] <%Reaped_Psyche> Because it's stronger than normal.
[1:21:43] <IntrepidEye> I think there was when the changes were first made. The just didn't keep the tool tips
[1:21:44] <tetraes> It uses green ammo
[1:21:45] <Zedimonx5> So Pat just got Gold Experience Requiemed.... got it
[1:21:48] <Crushter> if you run the campaign now it tells you how they work @AngriestPat
[1:21:51] <+Fynale> @AngriestPat it'd explain it during the campaign
[1:21:51] <EpslionBear> because it uses that ammo type
[1:21:55] <fru1tycak3> @angriestpat Bungo expect, for some reason, for the average player to keep up with their Dev Docs
[1:21:57] <%dekkitout> Only purples get random rolls
[1:21:59] <%IMDRanged> Is this a non-Activision Destiny 2?
[1:22:02] <+Ryan1016> Ikora has big fat nothing now
[1:22:04] <+Fynale> @AngriestPat they took that off her
[1:22:04] <chronoxgp> every time this game comes out i buy it twice to get the DLC
[1:22:04] <MasterDecoder> nOT ANYMORE
[1:22:05] <%Maids4lyfe> nope
[1:22:05] <+purelyplum> Its special gun now instead of power
[1:22:06] <+Ryan1016> She's the bounty girl
[1:22:07] <Segartner> because random rolls are exclusive to legendaries.
[1:22:08] <%Jay_Squirrel> not anymore
[1:22:08] <%Piemen99> @AngriestPat not amymore
[1:22:09] <$Sdeje> not anymore
[1:22:09] <+bigcomfyman> she's useless now
[1:22:09] <corrosivePaladin> Its on the strike menu now
[1:22:09] <IndoorSitup> not anymore

[1:22:26] <%Jay_Squirrel> past missions are in the strike menu
[1:22:27] <$afronooch> yep
[1:22:29] <HeySeuss> It's on the vanguard selection area now
[1:22:32] <JamboLovePanda> it will get worse come October when the new armor uses a different system but all the old armor is still available with their old systems
[1:22:34] <+cahv123> I feel like this is a point when someone starts talking about how entitled gamers are for expecting a game to explain it's mechanics.

[1:23:34] <+purelyplum> Spans all dlc missions
[1:23:35] <BlueSpartan119> you could never choose to replay all the missions at any time
[1:23:35] <%Too_Much_Nukie> That's fucking retarded.
[1:23:38] <%realm_forge> It refreshed daily
[1:23:40] <%dekkitout> They rotate daily, because live service~ 🎇
[1:23:48] <+Ryan1016> Strikes PogChamp
[1:23:51] <%Kirby_Sauce> There used to be ony 3 pat, and those rotated too
[1:23:51] <+Foobe> I imagine people will just want to replay them later, so maybe they'll change that
[1:23:54] <+d00msdaydan> ikora's was three missions that rotated every week so it's an improvement
[1:23:55] <$afronooch> its dumb, but nobody does em
[1:23:55] <corrosivePaladin> no
[1:23:56] <%Piemen99> no
[1:23:56] <Crushter> They take away the option
[1:23:57] <%Jay_Squirrel> nope
[1:23:58] <Segartner> no
[1:23:58] <ScreamLord> @AngriestPat You can also select specific Nightfall Strikes for the week
[1:23:58] <+Ryan1016> Once you reach level 50 you cant run the lower ones
[1:24:00] <SuperCress> Yeah, when your pussy hurts.
[1:24:01] <bruno_silv0> no
[1:24:01] <+Fynale> @AngriestPat if you were leveling yes
[1:24:01] <%Kirby_Sauce> Yes
[1:24:02] <%dekkitout> I forgot you could change it
[1:24:04] <+angel949> you can visit the planet they were on and talk to the vendors there to do old missions
[1:24:04] <goroke> No, other than accomodating lower level players
[1:24:05] <Segartner> the option disappears
[1:24:06] <%Kirby_Sauce> For fun
[1:24:06] <Russ0202> No
[1:24:09] <+Ryan1016> Guided games are dead
[1:24:09] <Crushter> It was abandoned
[1:24:09] <fru1tycak3> @angriestpat they remove the option once you hit 600+
[1:24:13] <%Craytonex> you only do them for power drops
[1:24:19] <BlueSpartan119> guided games was a mistake
[1:24:22] <+purelyplum> Guided games kinda got abandoned
[1:24:25] <IndoorSitup> i'd say this whole game is still in beta
[1:24:33] <%Reaped_Psyche> They also got rid of "Prestige" nightfalls.
[1:24:34] <$Timesteel> you can set nightfall modifiers too from an item xur sells
[1:24:49] <%ArcanumMBD> Just don't be confused, easy
[1:24:51] <%Niney_Who> wow you did it
[1:24:54] <%Niney_Who> Good job
[1:24:55] <+Foobe> you did ti!
[1:24:55] <ScreamLord> @AngriestPat Nobody uses Guided Game and Bungie still refuses to just put Match Making in Nightfalls and Raids
[1:24:56] <SuperCress> Broke it.
[1:24:57] <%dekkitout> Don't worry about that one
[1:24:57] <%Reaped_Psyche> A tess bounty.
[1:24:57] <%Niney_Who> Congrats
[1:24:58] <Segartner> LUL
[1:24:58] <+Ryan1016> That was one of the things on the left side
[1:24:58] <$Dutchpotato> you did it
[1:24:58] <+Fynale> @AngriestPat they've added a new game mode with every year 2 dlc and they all have matchmaking like heroic strikes so guided games aren't needed outside of raids
[1:25:00] <%Jay_Squirrel> go get your fuckin box
[1:25:01] <Crushter> @AngriestPat do you have someone that can help you like, in a call?
[1:25:01] <BlueSpartan119> you got 70 bright dust
[1:25:04] <%XeroSigmaPrime> HOLY FUCK HOW DID YOU DO IT?!
[1:25:07] <$afronooch> he screm
[1:25:08] <$valriot> @angriestpat There's also unique grindable weapon in Nightfalls now as well, so there's reason to run them whenever
[1:25:09] <$Dutchpotato> +
[1:25:09] <JamboLovePanda> that bounty was completed, you turned it in
[1:25:09] <SpaceGuntank> i'm just as confused as you are, i never played this game past the very first raid.
[1:25:09] <%Niney_Who> Go get your dumb prize box, birthday boy
[1:25:12] <corrosivePaladin> You completed an Eververse bounty. She gave you a basic "Kill 75 enemies"
[1:25:14] <+purelyplum> Cash shop quest
[1:25:14] <%SolverCODO> Paige is up too? what a weird early stream
[1:25:17] <ConLin_Arts_> baby screm
[1:25:20] <+Foobe> get ready for your exotic dance routine!
[1:25:24] <+Fynale> @AngriestPat when you click on a bounty you "turn it in"
[1:25:25] <corrosivePaladin> Go talk to the eververse for your free engram
[1:25:30] <%realm_forge> You earned some cosmetics currency
[1:25:33] <%Maids4lyfe> she gives you free shit
[1:25:35] <%wsintai> I dunno why not i guess
[1:25:36] <%dekkitout> She's giving you a free taste of microtransactions
[1:25:38] <+Thesoleone> have you never played destiny before? or only destiny one?
[1:25:38] <+Ryan1016> Free stuff
[1:25:42] <%XeroSigmaPrime> HOW DID THIS MAN MANAGE TO DO THAT?!
[1:25:44] <%Niney_Who> Free stuff
[1:25:44] <Goldenwolf98> They sure as hell did a good job showing this game will go free to play just with its all designed now
[1:25:46] <IndoorSitup> open that shit
[1:25:47] <Crushter> @AngriestPat you got a quest from her that asked you to complete a bounty. you completed said bounty and she gives you a fancy box
[1:25:50] <corrosivePaladin> Smash them for dust then
[1:25:52] <%Maids4lyfe> yes you do
[1:25:53] <+Foobe> loot get!
[1:25:54] <%Jay_Squirrel> crounch em
[1:25:56] <+purelyplum> Destroy all that
[1:26:01] <$Sdeje> well it's free so you get it
[1:26:05] <+Ryan1016> Dust PogChamp
[1:26:06] <%dekkitout> Ideally, ignore Tess and her sub par cosmetics store
[1:26:06] <Segartner> WHY
[1:26:07] <%Piemen99> not the shaders!
[1:26:14] <+Fynale> @AngriestPat those are teh currency used to buy eververse "quests"
[1:26:15] <corrosivePaladin> Dust is your free-muim currency to buy cosmetic junk
[1:26:17] <%Reaped_Psyche> It's free why complain.
[1:26:24] <+Ryan1016> You can kill the shaders its fine
[1:26:25] <Crushter> just do it
[1:26:29] <+Xpertire> excuse me, how many mod components
[1:26:30] <Crushter> it's fine
[1:26:31] <%Niney_Who> It's fine
[1:26:33] <+Fynale> @AngriestPat yes scrap them
[1:26:33] <%Too_Much_Nukie> Because that guy likes shaders.
[1:26:33] <%Jay_Squirrel> shaders dont matter
[1:26:34] <%dekkitout> Yes
[1:26:35] <$afronooch> yep
[1:26:35] <$ESP_ROOT> Jebaited
[1:26:38] <BlueSpartan119> if he isnt gonna use them rn he might as well trash them for dust
[1:26:38] <chronoxgp> wtf lol
[1:26:39] <%XeroSigmaPrime> WHY DID YOU KILL THE SHADERS?! THOSE ARE EXPENSIVE
[1:26:41] <%Reaped_Psyche> OH GOD NO
[1:26:41] <Russ0202> It fine
[1:26:41] <fru1tycak3> @angriestpat Ignore that man
[1:26:41] <$afronooch> you were told right
[1:26:41] <+FennecZephyr> @AngriestPat Dont worry, ytou're fine
[1:26:41] <joedatuous> fucking lol
[1:26:42] <+angel949> that's correct
[1:26:43] <+Ryan1016> Just color when you want and junk the rest yeah
[1:26:44] <+bigcomfyman> when people say it skips stuff it doesn't. the things stay forever but you are not forced to do them if you don't want to. cuz they're bad. when they say you can skip they just mean you can go to the good stuff and ignore the old bad stuff you can still do it if you want it's just not recommended.
[1:26:45] <Goldenwolf98> NOTHINGS FINE Kappa
[1:26:46] <+Ryan1016> Good job pat
[1:26:46] <BlueSpartan119> before they change the eco
[1:26:47] <TubesockCommando> Anything you get from Eververse can be bought for Legendary Shards after Oct 1, so no reason to keep it
[1:26:50] <ScreamLord> @AngriestPat It's fine
[1:26:51] <IndoorSitup> pat says "i don't get it" so much he should make a shirt out of it
[1:26:54] <$afronooch> you did good
[1:26:57] <wizzerobe93> Yes you want to trash them, half of this chat has no idea what they are talking about
[1:26:58] <%ghostfarts315> that fine
[1:27:01] <+purelyplum> Basically since you played all year 1 you probably got all that stuff so destroy everything that converts to dust.
[1:27:13] <HeySeuss> Okay, so looking at chat, I can tell that half the people here haven't payed attention to this game for a year and are giving info from a year ago
[1:27:15] <Crushter> Just do it later
[1:27:19] <%Reaped_Psyche> That's just the armor. Oh god Pat. People are lying to you so hard.
[1:27:21] <$Timesteel> do it after forsaken
[1:27:21] <Segartner> @angriestpat you could just do forsaken
[1:27:21] <+bigcomfyman> not YET
[1:27:22] <fru1tycak3> Yep
[1:27:24] <Segartner> yes
[1:27:24] <chronoxgp> i keep all my exotics, it doesn't matter in multiplayer
[1:27:24] <corrosivePaladin> yes
[1:27:26] <%Piemen99> yes
[1:27:27] <carzeri> just do the campaign and enjoy it and youll get everything along the way
[1:27:27] <%Craytonex> its 5 times longer than the campaign
[1:27:28] <$afronooch> Yes
[1:27:29] <+Fynale> @AngriestPat you'll get better gear while doing forsaken stuff it's like a new expansion
[1:27:29] <+FennecZephyr> @AngriestPat You'll get much better gear in forsaken
[1:27:30] <IndoorSitup> maybe
[1:27:31] <+Ryan1016> Do it after yeah, the campaigns won't take you that long
[1:27:32] <Reanimator83> Yes
[1:27:32] <+bigcomfyman> fuck warmind
[1:27:32] <Segartner> do forsaken first
[1:27:35] <%realm_forge> Yes.
[1:27:37] <Fubberknucked> @AngriestPat sryy if spam but doing dailies before lvl 50 means your missing out on like 10 powerful engrams worth of light boost because they dont reset
[1:27:37] <Goldenwolf98> stay busted and limp ITS FINE
[1:27:37] <corrosivePaladin> Hit level 50. Then do whatever you want
[1:27:38] <%Niney_Who> Forsaken gives much better
[1:27:38] <%wsintai> I have no idea what Im talking about but sure Yes
[1:27:39] <Crushter> @Reaped_Psyche don't say that, his stuff was from Warmind, IE pointless
[1:27:40] <fru1tycak3> Campaign content is Quick to bang out
[1:27:41] <%dekkitout> Sure, if you want to get to 50, then do Solstice, you have till the 27th or so
[1:27:41] <SuperCress> Do Solstice on leisure, babycakes.
[1:27:43] <HeySeuss> Year one shaders were expensive and rare, in year 3 shaders are gonna cost legendary shards and glimmer instead
[1:27:43] <IntrepidEye> forsaken gets you a lot of good gear
[1:27:43] <MasterDecoder> @AngriestPat Have DK drag you through Warmind and Forsaken THEN Solstice
[1:27:44] <$Dutchpotato> no listen to me Pat :) I'm the only one who knows
[1:27:45] <+Ryan1016> Hey pat got a sweet fusion
[1:27:45] <BlueSpartan119> you can gwt through warmind & forsaken in like a day
[1:27:50] <rusho> Solstice, AFTER campaign
[1:27:52] <Reanimator83> You’ll get better stuff along the way
[1:27:53] <+Fynale> @AngriestPat the solstice is only better at 50
[1:27:54] <Russ0202> Did you play Dlc1?
[1:27:56] <+bigcomfyman> better than current gear
[1:27:58] <+Ryan1016> Solstice is just armor
[1:27:58] <carzeri> stop confusing pat by saying dumb shit
[1:27:59] <+FennecZephyr> Warmind kinda sucks though. You can always do it again later
[1:27:59] <%Too_Much_Nukie> Solstice only gives better gear at level 50 Pat.
[1:28:01] <%dekkitout> Solstice's max upgraded armor is 750
[1:28:03] <Crushter> You can't use the Solstice shit at the moment, seriously worry about gear when you hit 50 @AngriestPat
[1:28:04] <%Jay_Squirrel> do solstice after campaign
[1:28:05] <joedatuous> just do what you want pat
[1:28:06] <BlueSpartan119> campaign missions level you faster
[1:28:06] <$afronooch> Solstice don't really matter besides it being shiny
[1:28:08] <Segartner> Fuck warming - Do forsaken
[1:28:09] <%Ranryu692> rofl I definitely didn't expect Pat to be streaming when I took my 4 am am lunch break
[1:28:10] <corrosivePaladin> Yes. Solstace is all about that golden armor. That you cant really get to you complete 2 sets of objective junk
[1:28:13] <%Jay_Squirrel> you have the better part of a month
[1:28:16] <carzeri> solstice is completely irrelevant to pat rn, stop confusing him with it
[1:28:19] <+angel949> the solstice armor will carry over to shadow keep as the first of armor2.0
[1:28:20] <goroke> You keep conflicting answers to different questsions pat
[1:28:20] <SuperCress> People say that Solstice stuff will need a buffin' after October anyway.
[1:28:21] <%Jay_Squirrel> go at your own pace
[1:28:31] <IndoorSitup> play with your foreskin pat
[1:28:32] <%realm_forge> All the solstice armor does is give you access to the new armor system right off the bat in October
[1:28:34] <$valriot> @archangel317 Solstice is just dickhead FFXIV eureka armour
[1:28:36] <+purelyplum> No just focus on getting lvl 50 first, then story, alongside solstice when your able
[1:28:37] <%VantomPayne> apatPorgmo apatPorgmo
[1:28:39] <IndoorSitup> forsaken i meant
[1:28:39] <Goldenwolf98> Destiny 2 feels as confusing as Warframe shit at this point LUL
[1:28:44] <+Fynale> @AngriestPat you don't need to do warmind it's a side quest that has no bearing on forsaken
[1:28:50] <TwentyCXII> Warmind ResidentSleeper
[1:28:53] <%dekkitout> It's fine
[1:28:54] <+d00msdaydan> solstice armor doesn't matter worth shit anyway
[1:28:55] <+Thesoleone> @angriestpat the solstice armor is only good if you fully upgrade it from green, to blue, to purple. it takes a massive ass amount of time, but itll be usable in the new xpac
[1:28:56] <+Ryan1016> @AngriestPat Pat this would kind of be like doing Plague star at MR3 if that makes sense, you COULD do it but it'd be hard and not really worth it rn
[1:28:58] <corrosivePaladin> Last years stuff became worthless after a week its ok
[1:29:02] <%Jay_Squirrel> then dont bother, its grindy as fuck
[1:29:03] <+bigcomfyman> it's the exact same armor it's fine
[1:29:04] <Segartner> it's fine pat.
[1:29:06] <goroke> Solstice is for crazies who want the looks to be carried over
[1:29:10] <RepMetal18> Bungie put all their info about patches and updates in their TWABs instead of ingame. Look in their archived TWABs for the answers you need to help set you in the right direction. Also would be good to wait for your friend to guide you. @AngriestPat
[1:29:11] <Goldenwolf98> LUL
[1:29:16] <+Ryan1016> Yeah don't skip warmind play it
[1:29:18] <+Fynale> @AngriestPat you're not skipping it you can do it later
[1:29:20] <+d00msdaydan> @AngriestPat when you use the booster you can still go back and play warmind
[1:29:21] <+bigcomfyman> you can just do it later
[1:29:22] <$afronooch> Warmind is okay
[1:29:23] <Russ0202> Then play warmind then Forsaken if you don’t want to skip campaign
[1:29:25] <carzeri> thats right pat, YOU TELL EM
[1:29:26] <Goldenwolf98> Skip the money
[1:29:26] <joedatuous> chat big stupid
[1:29:31] <goroke> Play through the campaigns through Warmind, Forsaken and get to max level
[1:29:31] <Segartner> you can do it later pat
[1:29:35] <IndoorSitup> a
[1:29:37] <SuperCress> Well than go play it, you big ol manbaby.
[1:29:38] <%VantomPayne> i mean, its 2.1 to 2.4 if that helps you understand
[1:29:38] <faegbeard> pay money to make number go UP
[1:29:38] <$boxboten> blame WoW
[1:29:38] <LeftOverPizza13> just skip it
[1:29:39] <goroke> then worry about light level
[1:29:40] <carzeri> warmind is actually fun imo
[1:29:43] <+Fynale> @AngriestPat you're already level 30 you can do warmind at lvl 50 and it'll scale to you at 50
[1:29:43] <+bigcomfyman> forsaken good warmind bad do good now
[1:29:45] <+angel949> you can go back and do it later, the story isn't connected to forsaken
[1:29:45] <$Dutchpotato> no just buy exp boosters to skip the grind Pat. even though this game is 99% grinding
[1:29:46] <%realm_forge> Hell no warmind was cool as hell
[1:29:47] <%Piemen99> it's for the ult charaters
[1:29:48] <seycheles> patt gorilla pressin hard right now
[1:29:49] <%Jay_Squirrel> id only say skip if youve done it before
[1:29:49] <%Reaped_Psyche> @Crushter I mean the Eververse stuff. The ships and shaders aren't going to be that cheap to get back. Most will cost bright dust. It's the Eververse armors that are coming back as ornaments for Legenday shards I thought. Doesn't the rest of it still cost bright dust?
[1:29:49] <%dekkitout> Its for those who want new shiny
[1:29:49] <indig0bird> Truth
[1:29:51] <HeySeuss> Yeah no, you do the DLCs that you want to play, ignore people saying skip
[1:29:52] <ConLin_Arts_> Skip to 70 to start Shadowbringers Kappa
[1:29:52] <TwentyCXII> Pretty sure it's a prerequisite purchase to even get the new stuff, no?
[1:29:53] <+Foobe> i know someone who bought all of FFXIV, skipped all of the current content, got a level up pass too, and bought the expac
[1:29:53] <%MegboyManuel> waste your money because it' not their money
[1:29:54] <%Maids4lyfe> because people hated that story mission @AngriestPat
[1:29:56] <HeySeuss> Have your fun with the thing
[1:30:00] <Goldenwolf98> You waste your money anyways Pat ITS FIIIIINE Kappa
[1:30:00] <Nina96> isnt that a lot?
[1:30:00] <%dekkitout> "But new shiny tho"
[1:30:00] <+Sgt_Wigglytuff> Just play the game just play the game then
[1:30:01] <%terminallyCapriciousz> yeah but ARR sucks ass
[1:30:01] <%Kazooki_Kazami> I buy jump pots for my alts in other worlds
[1:30:01] <$afronooch> fair
[1:30:01] <BlueSpartan119> Warmind campaign is like 6-7 missions, you can bust it out fast
[1:30:03] <+Foobe> it was like 100 something dollars.
[1:30:03] <+d00msdaydan> in the time pat's been agonizing over whether to skip warmind of not he would have beaten it by now
[1:30:06] <+therealpaulrudd> what about jump potions for other jobs
[1:30:07] <$Timesteel> warmind is like 2-3 hours
[1:30:07] <SuperCress> Bruh, I beat the game. I still don't know whats going on.
[1:30:08] <faegbeard> the real destiny is the content we skipped along the way
[1:30:08] <IndoorSitup> im just here to watch pat yell at chat
[1:30:10] <Segartner> they are different stories pat
[1:30:12] <%MegboyManuel> ARR is okay
[1:30:13] <Zedimonx5> Just skip stormblood pat Kappa
[1:30:14] <%terminallyCapriciousz> ARR made me literally almost quit, fuck 2.x
[1:30:14] <$boxboten> job skips are fine since you literally learn nothing from 1-60
[1:30:15] <Neo_Kaiser> If you're "supposed" to skip game content, why is that content even there?
[1:30:17] <Crushter> @Reaped_Psyche eververse things will cost Shards only to reacquire
[1:30:17] <joedatuous> pat just skip content lol xd
[1:30:17] <+Fynale> @AngriestPat it's a literal side quest that you can do think of the base game and forsaken as the MSQ
[1:30:18] <indig0bird> Kinda like those people who started tanking with GNB
[1:30:19] <Fubberknucked> yes exactly the game is good, and that is why people shit on destinys story
[1:30:21] <ConLin_Arts_> baby
[1:30:22] <+jaydenjuiceman> Do it to find out why to skip it :)
[1:30:23] <bgambo> Just do forsaken then warmind later
[1:30:26] <ConLin_Arts_> baby buyy
[1:30:26] <+FennecZephyr> @AngriestPat I mean, you can beat Warmind tonight if you start it now
[1:30:27] <ne0bunny> I totally agree Pat. why buy a game to not play more than half of it
[1:30:28] <ConLin_Arts_> butt*
[1:30:30] <Segartner> LUL
[1:30:31] <indig0bird> They didn't know how the fuck to tank
[1:30:32] <$ESP_ROOT> mrrow
[1:30:35] <+purelyplum> Because misinformation has spread through people that think osiris an warmind are absolutely garbage. Please just play story in order like you know your going to
[1:30:35] <%Reaped_Psyche> @crushter ....Well fuck. I apologise.
[1:30:38] <%MegboyManuel> Pay money to skip content you bought with money. Galaxy Brain
[1:30:38] <%hussdogrob> but for those people they just want an endgame experience crazy as it maybe
[1:30:40] <Neo_Kaiser> If that content is boring then the developers need to redesign it
[1:30:43] <Segartner> Pat do whatever you feel like doing.
[1:30:43] <+bigcomfyman> you can just do it later
[1:30:44] <+FennecZephyr> Okay yeah, not 15
[1:30:46] <OBS_VinnieK> ARR is so bad they are going to fix it
[1:30:46] <+Ryan1016> Yeah you can finish in 15 min Kappa
[1:30:52] <Russ0202> Did you buy Forsaken ?
[1:30:53] <SuperCress> Aww shit, it IS 4:30
[1:30:53] <Goldenwolf98> Skip it all by just not playing the game Kappa
[1:30:57] <%Jay_Squirrel> just go fast
[1:30:57] <%dekkitout> This is kinda why expansions aren't going to be linear anymore
[1:30:58] <%realm_forge> Armand was cool and it will set you up or forsaken
[1:30:59] <$afronooch> Like 3 hours tops though, it's quick
[1:30:59] <Neo_Kaiser> Stay up later.
[1:31:01] <ConLin_Arts_> it's just 11am for me Kappa
[1:31:02] <%RubberFistFight> Chat: "Pat, play Destiny." Also chat: "NO PAT JUST SKIP IT" Kappa
[1:31:03] <+SuperiorDelta> @AngriestPat It's ok that you didn't get last years gear, I got it but was unable to do the raids / nighfalls because I had no one to play with so I just have incomplete gear staring me in the face
[1:31:07] <MasterDecoder> @AngriestPat DK, otherwise, I'm working on Tweets
[1:31:07] <BlueSpartan119> you can beat warmind next D2 stream
[1:31:08] <+angel949> please do that
[1:31:08] <Neo_Kaiser> Real streamers stay up until 6
[1:31:09] <Crushter> @AngriestPat Pat, people say skip it because it was given away for free and was a wall in the way of Forsaken. If you want to play it, play it
[1:31:10] <%XeroSigmaPrime> SKIP IT ALL PAT
