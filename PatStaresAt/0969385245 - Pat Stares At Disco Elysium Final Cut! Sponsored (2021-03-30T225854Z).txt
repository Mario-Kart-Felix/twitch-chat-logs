[0:22:53] <+rissaleigh14> Accurate
[0:22:55] <+leonkillsashley> @PatStaresAt Planescape: Torment next?
[0:22:55] <+Shonen_hero> you were right
[0:22:56] <@commanderclaw> Instant Classic
[0:22:57] <Tisaric> you give it all the time you can
[0:22:58] <%za7az> IT ONLY GETS BETTER
[0:22:59] <+eanscrale> A landmark?
[0:23:00] <+OwlLightningMage> You never finished that RE marathon
[0:23:04] <Mucmaster> Cult classic at the very least
[0:23:04] <@SSaryn> It's got good story
[0:23:08] <+twohitgood> instant classic is a worthy term.
[0:23:09] <+OwlLightningMage> Or the New Vegas DLC
[0:23:12] <+Shonen_hero> And people will not shut up about Disco Elysium, and they fucking shouldn't
[0:23:12] <%Blackleafx> People still won't shut up about what can change the measure of a man
[0:23:13] <honeyman18> This is an OG
[0:23:14] <bettysharkface> Changed the fucking world man.
[0:23:16] <%luftraumm1> I think it's the best game ever made, it takes the medium to such hights
[0:23:17] <scrumbotime> This game sears your brain like a well done steak and you come out of it smarter just from the number of new words and concepts that will be forced into your brain
[0:23:17] <+wizard_of_diamonds> Brutal but true

[0:23:23] <%Ranryu692> You're maybe the first person I've ever heard mention "Planescape Torment"
[0:23:23] <thetunnelhomer> Eeeh. Torment is pretty overrated as a game.
[0:23:24] <filialpails> what can update the journal of a aman?
[0:23:26] <jorniev> this IS one of THOSE SUPER GOOD GAMES
[0:23:26] <EsotericOdyssey> what about pillars of eternity?
[0:23:30] <$Monkeyweed21> that genre totally still exists now
[0:23:32] <Tracazoid> Yeah, there's a reason why Planescape Torment and Baldur's Gate still get talked up, they're awesome.
[0:23:32] <digaogrunge> DISCO ELYSIUM IS BETTER THEN TORMENT there I said it
[0:23:35] <Press_X_ToJASON> @snausages_ i had a heart attack from grabbing a tie
[0:23:35] <Blank9> what can change the pants of man is the real morality question of disco elysium

Two unrelated things: One, do you have any advice for when internet upload speeds decided to shit itself and won't you stream anything? Two: I'd imagine a western Yakuza would be a 1920's Italian mobster asking people if they are secretly Irish.
[0:30:02] <%SpaghettiTime44> facts
[0:30:03] <%thelaxinator> Apparently "Ultraliberal" in this game means "capitalist" kind of a weird translation
[0:30:04] <jorniev> NOT THAT ROYAL FAMILLY
[0:30:04] <antimatter_man> You definitely say eat the rich a lot
[0:30:04] <AdmiralButtloaf> beg for money to become rich
[0:30:04] <%metalicblackcherry> will pat go ultralib?

[0:30:16] <antimatter_man> Orb
[0:30:18] <Mucmaster> I'm fat and delicious. Does that make me rich?
[0:30:20] <OldManDeckardCain> but pat, you are rich, and fat TPFufun
[0:30:21] <Tracazoid> The rich have that high quality food, thus eating them must also be of a higher quality

[0:32:41] <%BallerSwagBro9k> I LOVE PUMPKIN HILL
[0:32:41] <%Standard_Enemy> Chao garden is the only reason to play sonic adventure

[0:32:47] <%YakumoYomi> Finding the emeralds? Those are fine.
[0:32:47] <@SSaryn> Also Sonic Adventure 1 and 2 are still easily the best 3D Sonic games.
[0:32:48] <apathetic_yeti> SONIC ADVENTURE 2 BATTLE
[0:32:48] <LunarRemix> Those games suck so much
[0:32:49] <%SpaghettiTime44> There's never been a good Sonic game
[0:32:49] <wannabemoogle> It was shit but I loved it but I cant play it now. It's chao garden only now
[0:32:50] <%sumrand0> Pumpkin Hill Zone = AT LEAST THE MUSIC WAS GOOD
[0:32:50] <%ExpressNode> Those Knuckles lvls are not even that bad you can beat his stages in 2 hours if you try

For example, the radiation exposure from a point source (with no shielding) gets smaller the farther away it is. If the source is 2x as far away, it's 1/4 as much exposure.
[0:34:03] <%that__tj> Size does NOT equal fall speed!
[0:34:03] <+IMAS101> nah. its just the larger you are, the greater your terminal velocity

[0:42:09] <+allups> all stealth bow build in skyrim thats the only way to paly
[0:42:10] <+Calamity2007> The main complain I heard about this game is that even though dialogue your personality affects things greatly, plot wise it is kind of linear
[0:42:10] <%sumrand0> "WE'LL GET YOU, SECRET PROTESTANTS!"-The Irish and Alexander Anderson
[0:42:10] <Lutre> psaGoblin psaGoblin psaGoblin
[0:42:13] <$tungmccheese> i do one no cheat and one where I cheat my ass off

[0:42:16] <digaogrunge> ITS OPTIMAL
[0:42:19] <Dio_TR> GOBLIN BRANI

[0:42:25] <+MyshkaMysh> O_O
[0:42:25] <+nikoloas_> same tho
[0:42:27] <Dio_TR> THE OPTIMAL WAY
[0:42:30] <%that__tj> Yeah but
[0:42:32] <Karhax> But in this game there are talk stuff that is not charisma
[0:42:32] <$Afterman_> @PatStaresAt is a literal Bard
[0:42:35] <%that__tj> where is the fun?
[0:42:37] <%Ranryu692> I just let my problems win lol
[0:42:38] <TheAntiNihilist> ... that sounds weird after finishing all dialogue in the first playthrough
[0:42:39] <+mczarklesby> What if every stat was charisma though?
[0:42:40] <+Calamity2007> Same, maybe that is why Fallout 4 I didn't like, it also made my run of New Vegas kind of busted
[0:42:41] <+allups> well how many people really solve problems with guns and fist
[0:42:43] <fuji_92> same, without the talking for work part
[0:42:46] <lambishly> Also in most RPGs the Talky option usually just has more content
[0:42:47] <+AlphaRayAllen> This isn't fortnite
[0:42:48] <%thelaxinator> I have no idea what a phys/motorics run of this game would look like. It seems written for psy/int
[0:42:49] <TeaJayGee> but Pat, you also create problems by talking
[0:42:50] <%linSP> fair enough
[0:42:52] <Sunstalker> Wauw, so you've always played New vegas as the same build?
[0:42:54] <DiagunAquila> also fighting is always more boring cause its never made to be fun, just shootbang
[0:42:57] <%Puhff> mhmmmm
[0:43:02] <+OwlLightningMage> Fallout 4 is really bad
[0:43:05] <cardamomo88> ????

[0:44:48] <%Mendin> Ever played Tyranny? Its character creation has a brief CYOA segment after the normal creation that fleshes out your backstory and faction relations in the years leading up to the game

[0:50:25] <%GarbageQueenEllie> So having one skill too high can fuck you up
[0:50:26] <Ner234> It's the same VA for all 24 but still very impressive
[0:50:29] <cardamomo88> thats you

[0:50:37] <karovus> BUT BABA
[0:50:37] <aiutare47> THE COOLEST FEATURE
[0:50:42] <%ConLin_Arts_> monkaS
[0:50:42] <+Shonen_hero> you gotta find a balance
[0:50:42] <$metzselaar> 3333 for life

[0:50:50] <%sumrand0> Empathy = one of mine for sure, definitely would be an issue for me
[0:50:50] <%transporterthesequel> Its so great.
[0:50:51] <Sunstalker> If Pat is 4422, is Paige 2244? monkaS
[0:50:51] <+Shonen_hero> no balance is just as fun
[0:50:53] <+allups> i fuckiojng love that idea
[0:50:53] <%emperordread> Encyclopedia is SUCH a know-it-all
[0:50:54] <teflonbilly777> NERD!
[0:50:55] <%MisterRockett> Whoooooooooa
[0:51:01] <kazadog> i had conceptualization too high once and couldnt walk across a bridge because of it
[0:51:03] <Tisaric> fuck encyclopedia

[0:51:04] <cardamomo88> smartass
[0:51:04] <+RootVeggie> Which stat makes you hoard healing items?
[0:51:07] <+bassoontyphoon> Encyclopedia = Cliff Claven
[0:51:14] <yeeyeyee> Encyclopedia is half of this game's written lines
[0:51:14] <%transporterthesequel> I want every RPG to have stats where if they're too high they influence the game.
[0:51:15] <ZE_Count> a balance build is boring and you don't get the high interesting stuff
[0:51:18] <redginger666> I'm a encyclopedia, not a copedia
[0:51:18] <%Blackleafx> Encyclopedia is probably the best for a first time playthrough just fo the lore
[0:51:20] <honeyman18> I tried and holy shit does is spam you
[0:51:23] <teflonbilly777> High levels make you go "Bazinga!"

[1:51:00] <+ReallyBigRocks> That was a very Douglass Adams line
[1:51:08] <naoi0> @PulverKong There's a lot of talking but alsoa  good amount of action scenes/confrontations.
[1:51:10] <$Dreadlord134> The voice acting in this game is great
[1:51:11] <the_super_suit> kim is the best don't disappoint him
[1:51:13] <Ravioli_Ronin> The writing in this is great
[1:51:13] <+projectmanatees> 7 days
[1:51:19] <$lumporr> he just fucking tells you
[1:51:19] <naoi0> It's a text-based rpg

[1:52:02] <teflonbilly777> @Shonen_hero I find nothing about this being a new voice actor. Still sounds like Dasha, only re-recorded I guess
[1:52:02] <+Shonen_hero> that's rad
[1:52:06] <$realm_forge> I imagine Volition’s voice is Zangeif’s inner monologue

[2:52:20] <NeroInfinite> @iamtheTwitchghost Glue
[2:52:20] <@SSaryn> I looked it up and it is indeed any strong adhesive.
[2:52:27] <%shiplord13> @PatStaresAt Why are they making fun of you losing your badge when jackass glued his eyelids shut
[2:52:29] <AmericanaRed> WutFace
[2:52:31] <sirtommygunn> torson might be the only cop worse than you
[2:52:32] <%linSP> orb slappin
[2:52:33] <+Shonen_hero> man yeah all the police here are awful pricks. I love them
[2:52:33] <+BulletproofTophat> Fun fact: At some point in this game's development, Torson and Mclaine were the main characters
[2:52:34] <Dr_Mooose> nice beat
[2:52:41] <bettysharkface> FUn fact, if you call the doc first, then the station, Mack complains about being glued in the background
[2:52:43] <%GarbageQueenEllie> I feel like MC is actually the smart one out of all those cops
[2:52:43] <NeroInfinite> It's the scientific name of glue.
[2:52:46] <KaitlynnHere> Super glue was invented to be a suture for battle wounds
[2:52:46] <%dork_doggler> Because he didn't lose his badge
[2:52:46] <%linSP> LUL
[2:52:47] <%Mr_Pylon> The RCM is the best of the best

[2:52:54] <%rrratbastard> because even that idiot wouldnt lose his badge
[2:52:54] <%shurtal> Because everyone knows you
[2:52:55] <danpc5> cuz hes not a super cop
[2:52:55] <%AzureGale> You can fix superglue
[2:52:55] <%AncelDeLambert> shit's fucked
[2:52:55] <+GingerStrawhat> Cause your a Superstar Pat!
[2:52:56] <$RealThiele> frat house logic
[2:52:56] <@SSaryn> Cause one is you're blind for a bit, one is someone literally can steal his identity.
[2:52:56] <$dalmek> they probably did both honestly
[2:52:56] <iamtheTwitchghost> gotta laugh at others' misery
[2:52:57] <Pookiedaexzile> Empathy is for smart people
[2:52:57] <naoi0> Because losing your badge is something that affects the entire station's reputation? @PatStaresAt
[2:52:59] <%maskofmichael> everyones a dick i guess
[2:53:01] <+JaseAdrift> Because cops are assholes
[2:53:02] <%king_wragles> With you it's funny, with Torson it's genetic
[2:53:02] <kazadog> @bettysharkface best game
[2:53:03] <+twohitgood> because he's a *sober* idiot
[2:53:03] <Valentinius_Anodyne> You can point that out if you call the doc before the station
[2:53:04] <oddbunker> fuck mack
[2:53:04] <%0rond> to be fair, you aren't a prime example of a cop that happened to remove their badge
[2:53:05] <cardamomo88> because COPS
[2:53:06] <%bassoontyphoon> Theres an actual reason but thats spoilery
[2:53:07] <AvroEltz> Because nobody outside the station knows he did
[2:53:09] <DrStinkers> You should've glued your badge to your jacket
[2:53:09] <+kahryez> becuase you are the super cop
[2:53:13] <%MidnightBurst12> it's fun to make fun of the drunk
[2:53:13] <theshillman> she sounds cute
[2:53:13] <commonplebian> I mean, if this was't that kinda station you would have been fired already
[2:53:16] <KaitlynnHere> Because you’re an idiot who got so fucked up you forgot who you are
[2:53:18] <dinnydanny777> Did he glue his eyes shut with superglue and lose his badge though? Kappa
[2:53:21] <+chiazam> Because you're a SuperCop
[2:53:21] <%JusTTheGuyYouNeed> because even a moron that glued his eyes if super glue didn't lost his badge
[2:53:25] <sirtommygunn> Torson fucked up once, you've been a train wreck for awhile
[2:53:25] <KaitlynnHere> One seems worse than the other
[2:53:27] <+Jiggisnipe> LUL
[2:53:28] <+livingdynamo> funniest thing is that if you listen to the dialogue about the superglue and you call the station you can point it out, it's very funny

[2:53:31] <akitanito> I AM THE LAW

[3:59:22] <penitentpendant> I'm not certain if you can STILL look at the case files that was a 'logic' test in your ledger, now that it's transformed
[3:59:24] <%Tuna_Can_0> the body's not going anywhere atpCap
[3:59:26] <Mucmaster> It bothers me seeing him use medicine when he has 1 damage
[3:59:27] <%GalacticaPhanto> This game is fucking phenomenal
[3:59:27] <MrGreenToS> Could of held onto it

[3:59:53] <%Deft_Thought> Remember you can check that patch you found on the headlights of Kim's car
[3:59:56] <penitentpendant> And this is why perception is important~
[3:59:58] <sirtommygunn> those items are on the 2nd floor, you can't reach
[4:00:03] <glue_huffington> That bucket is on the floor above you
[4:00:03] <%TheWinged7> seems sus

[4:00:38] <theshillman> inland empire is the real MVP
[4:00:38] <$TheDrugWeCallWifi> I love how the game goes easy on you early on
[4:00:42] <DSD24> Bumble Cop
[4:00:43] <+twohitgood> you're bound to eventually start hitting those 50/50's
[4:00:43] <faegbeard> failure is progress :)
[4:00:47] <%RetroCop87> this game putting XCom RNG to shame
[4:00:47] <Tisaric> there are some skills that heal on fail
[4:00:49] <%TheWinged7> stop having trash stats pat Kappa
[4:00:50] <%Jack_of_No_Trades> And it is still amazing
[4:00:50] <sirtommygunn> Its ok, failure is a big part of the game
[4:00:50] <%BigCoffee> you didnt use any good stats in your character creation
[4:00:51] <%Undenizen> your game is SO much better for failing
[4:00:51] <penitentpendant> Interact with that Ledger!
[4:00:52] <%WhereIsWill> the struggles
[4:00:53] <Khester824> I live in Australia if I buy this game on pc will the Aussie FBI come and take it out computer?
[4:00:54] <jorniev> CHECK CORPSE
[4:00:55] <Tisaric> yeah it starts pretty bad
[4:00:55] <%Broand> That's not true, you lied about your gun
[4:00:55] <ZE_Count> still greatyh other the incel stuff
[4:00:56] <bettysharkface> Failures in this game, thankfully, are just the chance for more content.
[4:00:56] <%GarbageQueenEllie> Oh it can go worse
[4:00:56] <penitentpendant> The case files are worth xp
[4:00:57] <%metalicblackcherry> s'ok
[4:00:57] <fly2555_of_the_rebellion> its great
[4:00:57] <beautyfulman> @PatStaresAt Oh trust me, it could have been worse
[4:00:59] <digaogrunge> fail foward Pat
[4:01:00] <doctor_be> sometimes failure is good
[4:01:00] <$TheDrugWeCallWifi> You could be dead!

[4:01:09] <sirtommygunn> oh pat, it could, and will, go so much worse
[4:01:10] <%dork_doggler> @PatStaresAt Free heals are plentiful enough that it may be a good idea not to use healing items when you're one away from full
[4:01:11] <kazadog> @Khester824 nah they cant do shit
[4:01:11] <Tisaric> You fail a lot more early which is fun
[4:01:12] <Press_X_ToJASON> @RetroCop87 failing on sub-60% is hardly xcom like
[4:01:12] <%Lion_kun> That's why you save scum.
[4:01:13] <+vnzuelandude> failure is fine
[4:01:15] <+HotBloodedHero> Failure is fun in this
[4:01:16] <naoi0> @PatStaresAt Failure is part of the game. At least you're not playing on hardcore mode where all the difficulty checks are higher and you get higher exp
[4:01:17] <Valentinius_Anodyne> You can totally fail through this game and still do fine. Failure is an important step on the path to success

[4:35:47] <%dork_doggler> @Lodestarrobot that's what makes hgim the best
[4:35:48] <aiutare47> @Valentinius_Anodyne Im just now realizing how this game straight up says whats about to happen. Not forshadowing, just literally saying it.

[4:35:56] <the_super_suit> @the_super_suit if you go centrist basically no character will want to help you aside from the druggies
[4:35:57] <Pokerherz> atpNinja
[4:36:08] <%TheWinged7> Pat got peach her Wcdoogals
[4:36:11] <%Anime_Flux> But if Pat leaves the political decisions to chat instead, he avoids being racist and chat takes the bullet instead...
[4:36:13] <Lodestarrobot> it isn't just white supremacist racism it's like "you're not enough of a white supremacist to impress me"

[4:37:27] <%rrratbastard> its good to be a mess. that means youre in character.
[4:37:27] <naoi0> @PatStaresAt It happens and there's a lot to do, and at the least failure is fun in this game
[4:37:27] <%RetroCop87> @PatStaresAt Bad RNG man
[4:37:32] <primaryfire> you could have left it for later
[4:37:34] <teefpal> Nah, candance is just a con
[4:37:34] <%Jack_of_No_Trades> It has been awesome to watch, and I'd watch multiple playthroughs
[4:37:35] <KaiserMario> @PatStaresAt Why aren't save-scumming then? LUL
[4:37:35] <Bobbledygook> @the_super_suit LUL
[4:37:36] <%Mr_Pylon> there are so many skill points
[4:37:38] <glue_huffington> Yo fail forward. Interface will really help.
[4:37:38] <T_Sasquatch> It's almost like you fucked up LUL
[4:37:40] <%Broand> Why'd he invest in interface
[4:37:41] <Blank9> your stat cap is low, so you can't get interface much higher anyway
[4:37:42] <teefpal> Measurehead is more gobbels
[4:37:43] <Tisaric> it's kind of how the early game tends to go for most builds
[4:37:44] <+Badendchan> Being a disaster is kind of part of the EXPERIENCE
[4:37:46] <iosephe> Losing is fun
[4:37:47] <+Hyphixsys> 2.50$?? That's a highway robbery! Kappa
[4:37:47] <+BulletproofTophat> That'll happen

[4:37:51] <ZE_Count> oh drama
[4:37:52] <beautyfulman> @PatStaresAt You're going to be getting plenty of skill points, and I'll say it now, if you ever get that "I should restart the playthrough", you will NEVER finish this game
[4:37:54] <tanarath> @patstaresat I love the game, don't be discouraged.
[4:37:54] <Valentinius_Anodyne> You can fail through this game and still do fine, really. No need to worry
[4:37:56] <+Zeromaru2> From what I hear , that just how this game is sometimes.
[4:37:57] <+BulletproofTophat> especially in the early game

[4:38:36] <aiutare47> I have two things to say about this game that has pissed off everyone I talked about it with. Number 1 was that a save-scummed like a motherfucker.
[4:38:36] <Durahand> losing also opens up new paths and items
[4:38:40] <the_super_suit> the only rolls that matter are during the climax, and even then not that much

[4:45:02] <Valentinius_Anodyne> No
[4:45:02] <aiutare47> NO
[4:45:03] <%Mr_Pylon> not yet
[4:45:03] <beautyfulman> @PatStaresAt Not really, no
[4:45:03] <%shiplord13> Somehow yes
[4:45:03] <akitanito> No
[4:45:03] <Press_X_ToJASON> well

[4:45:06] <+SenorCounter> Damn it I barely got here. :(
[4:45:07] <%Jack_of_No_Trades> Great stream man! Super fun! Bought it because of this
[4:45:07] <Blank9> no, all investigations were good
[4:45:07] <wineauntiecathy> Nope
[4:45:07] <AvroEltz> No
[4:45:08] <cardamomo88> NOT REALLY
[4:45:08] <%rumtumtugnutz> failed so hard that the stream is over
[4:45:08] <Frostilk> Nah
[4:45:09] <%Mr_pale> most
[4:45:10] <+JaseAdrift> no
[4:45:10] <+ZenVulgarity> No
[4:45:10] <+AugustRei> nah
[4:45:10] <%arcielardor> yes
[4:45:10] <laserbeaming> not every single one
[4:45:10] <+Tredecian> its fine
[4:45:10] <naoi0> @PatStaresAt No, there's a lot of exploring around to do to the east and west
[4:45:10] <primaryfire> no
[4:45:10] <+Undenizen> Some checks are actually BETTER if you fail
[4:45:11] <faegbeard> failure is a kind of success
[4:45:11] <beautyfulman> @PatStaresAt Only real bad one was the Slyvie one
[4:45:11] <+CloudsBringRain> nah, there are moer to fail lmao
[4:45:11] <ZE_Count> nooo
[4:45:13] <%whyskeywolfe> You're not supposed to pass them all.
[4:45:13] <OzzyoftheMojave> dont be afraid to fail
[4:45:14] <Press_X_ToJASON> sometimes you fail, and that's OKAY
[4:45:14] <+Havictos> only some
[4:45:15] <Astrophizz> no
[4:45:15] <Cici_TheMoonRabbit> Failing some of them actually makes it better.
[4:45:15] <Mucmaster> Nah you're doing good
[4:45:16] <%bassoontyphoon> Failing important checks is not a bad thing in this game
[4:45:16] <Durahand> Only 2 or 3 very important checks and they aren't even game ender checks
[4:45:16] <donaghy> no
[4:45:16] <AvroEltz> It doesn't matter
[4:45:16] <digaogrunge> no
[4:45:17] <+Solomon742> You are a failure Pat
[4:45:18] <Lodestarrobot> you failed cuno
[4:45:18] <+twohitgood> you actually got the body down day 1?!?!?!?
[4:45:19] <+AugustRei> this game is about failing forward
[4:45:19] <%luftraumm1> naaaa
[4:45:19] <the_super_suit> @PatStaresAt it's literally impossible to fail this game
[4:45:19] <+aartbastiaan> you can never get fully stuck
[4:45:20] <%Broand> you did the Visual checks
[4:45:20] <akitanito> That's how it is usually
[4:45:20] <KaitlynnHere> No
[4:45:21] <MrGreenToS> No its fine Pat
[4:45:21] <+icekept> only the beginning ones
[4:45:22] <glue_huffington> Nope. Sometimes you WANT to fail them
[4:45:22] <wineauntiecathy> The game fails you forward
[4:45:23] <jorniev> YOU CAN FAIL A LOT MORE
[4:45:24] <Tisaric> you're not doing well but that's part of the game especially early
[4:45:24] <Blank9> there's multiple ways to get the body down
[4:45:24] <+Final705> No, you will fail a lot
[4:45:25] <+JaseAdrift> You have failed a lot but you havent failed everything
[4:45:25] <faithless_zealot> I failed every check
[4:45:26] <+InfectedEzio> probably not, but you should say sorry to everyone anyways.
[4:45:26] <KaitlynnHere> You’re good
[4:45:27] <cardamomo88> YOUR FINE
[4:45:27] <Estwilde> It's funny having the body laugh at you
[4:45:28] <user_naim> nah you’re good
[4:45:28] <artificiallynatural> Failure is just success but different
[4:45:28] <beautyfulman> @PatStaresAt Theres always more to fail at
[4:45:28] <+JustToWatch> most, but not all
[4:45:29] <Dalkalopagus> you passed a visual calculus
[4:45:29] <wineauntiecathy> There's like, no complete failures
[4:45:31] <+vnzuelandude> You fail forward, its fine
[4:45:31] <+tetraes> failing a check isnt the end it can lead to some cray cray shit
[4:45:32] <+mczarklesby> Oh no, loads more to fail still
[4:45:33] <+egalitarian696969> you good
[4:45:33] <BiologicGases> not all but just unlucky this time
[4:45:34] <Mucmaster> @PatStaresAt It took me 3 days to get the body down on my play through
[4:45:34] <%GabeSweetMan> The most important check
[4:45:34] <+livingdynamo> gigachad past pat
[4:45:35] <monzy101> rip
[4:45:36] <+twohitgood> i punched cuno but i also was going physical implement.
[4:45:37] <ZE_Count> your fine
[4:45:37] <teefpal> Don't worry, you have plenty of other things you can do
[4:45:38] <%lomack42> no actually doing p good
[4:45:38] <fatalDestiny> Dude I know folks who didn't get the body down until the last day, you're fine.
[4:45:38] <%luftraumm1> you're supposed to feel like shit
[4:45:38] <danpc5> you are not supose to pass them all
[4:45:39] <glue_huffington> When you fail checks, sometimes you get benefits
[4:45:39] <KaitlynnHere> Failure is apart of the game
[4:45:39] <+Tredecian> its the journey not the the destination
[4:45:39] <+icekept> u r fine
[4:45:39] <%rumtumtugnutz> I think you're supposed to feel bad this playthrough.
[4:45:39] <DartAran> There's always another way but you might have to work for it
[4:45:41] <+Shonen_hero> dude you fail a lot in this game
[4:45:41] <SelfAwareCanOpener> You lied about your gun fine
[4:45:42] <%DiscoMatador> Don't worry Pat-Cop theres always more Failure ahaed
[4:45:42] <%bassoontyphoon> This game thrives off of failure, its never a bad thing to fail
[4:45:43] <AvroEltz> I failed a fuck ton by the end of my game
[4:45:44] <Pookiedaexzile> Yeah but you didn't drink or invest in strength
[4:45:46] <Spartan3909> You scammed the old woman.
[4:45:46] <Astrophizz> getting the body down is actually kinda hard
[4:45:46] <Press_X_ToJASON> you'll be FINE
[4:45:48] <Valentinius_Anodyne> There's like only 1 or 2 checks you need to succeed to beat the game, as I recall. Failing a check isn't the end of the world
[4:45:51] <glue_huffington> Remember when Garte gave you that Commodore Red?
[4:45:51] <jorniev> this game makes fun of you for save scumming
[4:45:52] <Pookiedaexzile> Drinking is powerful
[4:45:52] <primaryfire> took me 2
[4:45:53] <+TheSaintJohn> its a narrative game, there is no failure just new experiences
[4:45:55] <%Livelinne> psaCrazyhand psaCrazyhead
[4:45:58] <ZE_Count> I got him down on the 2nd day
[4:45:59] <+mczarklesby> This is the true hobo cop experience
[4:45:59] <Tisaric> Yeah I didn't even realize I had to take it down and only got it after like 3 days
[4:46:00] <wineauntiecathy> failure usually rewards you with something bleakly funny
[4:46:02] <artificiallynatural> I'm on day two and I only managed to shoot the body
[4:46:03] <KaitlynnHere> Yea your lied to your cop friends so there’s that
[4:46:05] <ZE_Count> after shooting a child
[4:46:10] <%DashXero> I somehow got it down the first day by shooting the buckle... It was weird.
[4:46:15] <+twohitgood> @TheSaintJohn facts
[4:46:16] <%rumtumtugnutz> At least you didn't trip and bend your dick
[4:46:34] <Lodestarrobot> can you be blackmailed by that guy if you lie about having your gun
[4:46:50] <$RealThiele> pat actually sad about losing the kid punching dice
[4:46:59] <+allups> i hate it whn i bend my dick
[4:47:03] <Broken_Sonex> @jorniev Example please.
[4:47:07] <theshillman> punching the kid is great
[4:47:09] <%DashXero> Awww, man. The kid is unpunched?
[4:47:12] <+twohitgood> kid punching actually opened up a ton of options with cuno for me.
[4:47:29] <aiutare47> Pat the whole point of this game is that you don't know what checks are super important and which aren't. If you fail one there's always another that guides you in another direction. Its very hard not to but its important not to sweat it too much. Its all part of the "experience". @PatStaresAt
[4:47:34] <Valentinius_Anodyne> Punching Cuno is hilarious, but failing to punch Cuno is great too. Now Pat is Cuno's bitch
[4:47:34] <+InfectedEzio> gasp
[4:47:35] <Psyramics> oh god
[4:47:36] <$Afterman_> Ludvig Forssell left Kojima Productions
[4:47:41] <+twohitgood> woolie and reggie??
[4:47:42] <theshillman> next week, huh
[4:47:44] <ZE_Count> I hope he dont go full racism
[4:47:45] <%whyskeywolfe> If anyone wants more Disco Elysium, GermanSpy is only 10 hours into one of his typically huge streams.
[4:47:45] <+Jiggisnipe> he'll bug the game somehow
[4:47:45] <Broken_Sonex> Yeah.....i won't watch that.
[4:47:46] <naoi0> EYYYyy
[4:47:49] <theshillman> @Afterman_ F
[4:47:50] <%Livelinne> OhMyDog OhMyDog OhMyDog
[4:47:54] <%Monkeyweed21> SNAIL THROUGH
[4:47:58] <SelfAwareCanOpener> Oooh
[4:47:59] <%Livelinne> woolieYE woolieYE woolieYE
[4:48:08] <jorniev> @jorniev that card you get can be swept up in the wind
[4:48:09] <+twohitgood> you've done well with not save scumming.
[4:48:10] <Lodestarrobot> xcom
[4:48:11] <$Afterman_> @theshillman hes going freelancer
[4:48:14] <Brandon__Brando> he's going racist cop second one
[4:48:19] <aiutare47> @PatStaresAt Disclaimer: I save scumed SUPER hard
[4:48:21] <Blank9> you haven't gotten to any of the cool shit yet
[4:48:22] <%Monkeyweed21> never savescum in this game
[4:48:23] <Tisaric> you're honestly getting even more cool shit
[4:48:23] <Tracazoid> "Don't sweat it" *Pats mind goblins go into overdrive*
[4:48:24] <+twohitgood> you've gotten stuff people haven't seen.
[4:48:25] <+Tredecian> your arent
[4:48:25] <%AzureGale> FOMO activated
[4:48:27] <fatalDestiny> I save scummed in this game ONCE, and it was for a bit of flavour dialogue.
[4:48:28] <Tisaric> you'll get to it
[4:48:29] <naoi0> @PatStaresAt Again remember that the white checks are redoable, red checks aren't. Hence why you can like revisit them and try them again after you level up and raise your stats. Make sure as well to like change clothes before you do them!
[4:48:29] <jorniev> some options open up after failing checks
[4:48:29] <%Monkeyweed21> @PatStaresAt YOU AREN'T
[4:48:30] <ZE_Count> theres really only like 2 places I would save scum that mainly like big content stuff
[4:48:33] <+Jiggisnipe> failure is also good right?
[4:48:36] <+TheSaintJohn> the game is nothing but cool shit, success or failure
[4:48:37] <+TheCrispyBoi> it's fine
[4:48:40] <Lodestarrobot> rip the head off the body
[4:48:40] <%YakumoYomi> Body...?
[4:48:47] <donaghy> you're getting the cool failure state stuff
[4:48:47] <Valentinius_Anodyne> You definitely aren't. Honestly, you found stuff even I haven't seen, and I've beaten this game
[4:48:47] <%YakumoYomi> HORF!!!
[4:48:47] <Blank9> you pretty much can't miss most of the cool stuff, just delay it by a day or so while you do something else cool
[4:48:48] <ZE_Count> lots of replay
[4:48:49] <+Shonen_hero> I mean you miss cool shit by succeeding all the time
[4:48:50] <fatalDestiny> There's a couple bottleneck checks towards the end, but the final cut likely made them less of a bottleneck.
[4:48:50] <%Monkeyweed21> There are many ways to get the body down @PatStaresAt
[4:48:51] <the_super_suit> @PatStaresAt it's literally impossible to get all the cool shit in a single playthrough. or even in multiple. new shit is constantly discovered
[4:48:52] <%RetroCop87> It looks like Ludvig left in good spirits, so probably no drama
[4:48:53] <%blastyoboots> you CAN examine the body still you're not locked out of anything right now
[4:48:53] <%arcielardor> don't worry, you are
[4:48:53] <danpc5> fauilure is also good content
[4:48:54] <Astrophizz> you're not missing anything so far I don't think
[4:48:54] <jorniev> FAILING opens up a buch of things some times
[4:48:57] <Brandon__Brando> you got stuff I missed
[4:49:04] <+twohitgood> rip the head another playthrough.
[4:49:06] <donaghy> 100%
[4:49:14] <aiutare47> yeah, just in this playthrough you found stuff I missed
[4:49:16] <jorniev> YOU CAN!?
[4:49:16] <+vnzuelandude> eat the body
[4:49:17] <%Monkeyweed21> you got the exclusive LOVE quest
[4:49:18] <Psyramics> you will, you'll fail a check and it'll happen without your consent
[4:49:19] <%blastyoboots> you've shown me SO much I hadn't seen before with these fails.  THE LOVE QUEST, OH MY LORD.
[4:49:23] <aiutare47> Interface is useful
[4:49:27] <moojuh> I can't believe they made a whole game to go with the hoodie they sent you
[4:49:28] <Tisaric> it's fine, you get a ton of skill points
[4:49:29] <+twohitgood> interface gets you good stuff. nothing to worry about.
[4:49:29] <%Mr_Pylon> The skill
[4:49:30] <+Tredecian> after each levle up
[4:49:34] <$Afterman_> i thought it said once per day
[4:49:35] <aiutare47> LEVELING UP AT ALL
[4:49:39] <+vnzuelandude> Seduce the body
[4:49:40] <Visorak6> At all, iirc
[4:49:41] <%blastyoboots> every single stat-up
[4:49:42] <Valentinius_Anodyne> Any stat I think?
[4:49:43] <+Shonen_hero> leveling stat
[4:49:46] <jorniev> yup
[4:49:46] <$RealThiele> 4 answers nice
[4:49:46] <ZE_Count> test it
[4:49:46] <+mczarklesby> The stat
[4:49:49] <%blastyoboots> or raising it with clothes right?
[4:49:49] <Blank9> you're almost at level cap for interface, nothing is wasted
[4:49:51] <+Mr_Morbid> Rhetoric?
[4:49:53] <+Tredecian> after each levle up of the skill sorry
[4:49:53] <Astrophizz> that stat, or do something that makes the check easier in itself
[4:49:55] <YeetBoss> statr
[4:49:56] <%blastyoboots> OH LEVELING UP ANYTHING?!
[4:49:58] <laserbeaming> YOU CAN DRINK
[4:50:00] <%blastyoboots> oh
[4:50:01] <YeetBoss> you gotta level the stat
[4:50:02] <laserbeaming> oops
[4:50:03] <Valentinius_Anodyne> Interfacing is fine, it's cool
[4:50:04] <laserbeaming> all caps
[4:50:04] <ZE_Count> I think its the stat but I cant remember
[4:50:06] <Mucmaster> White checks reset everyday right?
[4:50:08] <Pookiedaexzile> YOU SHOULD DRINK
[4:50:09] <Tisaric> A lot
[4:50:09] <aiutare47> @PatStaresAt In your defense the tutorial says the opposite and its wrong
[4:50:09] <Visorak6> Interface is fine to have
[4:50:12] <Visorak6> A lot
[4:50:12] <%blastyoboots> OH RIGHT YOU COULD DRINK
[4:50:13] <jorniev> a bucnh
[4:50:14] <+Tredecian> many
[4:50:14] <Psyramics> don't ask that
[4:50:14] <%Mr_Pylon> No it's levelling the stat or finding something that helps with the stat
[4:50:15] <jorniev> A LOT
[4:50:16] <Valentinius_Anodyne> A bunch
[4:50:17] <aiutare47> A fair amount
[4:50:18] <%AzureGale> A zillion
[4:50:19] <Blank9> a LOT
[4:50:19] <+AugustRei> a lot
[4:50:19] <%Monkeyweed21> many
[4:50:20] <%Mr_Pylon> I dunno, 30+
[4:50:20] <fatalDestiny> A lot, I think close to 30, depends how much stuff you do,
[4:50:20] <faithless_zealot> @PatStaresAt I'm pretty sure you have to level up relavent stat to try again
[4:50:21] <Astrophizz> a lot
[4:50:21] <+Shonen_hero> a lot
[4:50:22] <laserbeaming> you can get a lot
[4:50:22] <+twohitgood> spending goblins coming up.
[4:50:22] <+mczarklesby> No the stat or booze
[4:50:24] <the_super_suit> enough
[4:50:25] <Tisaric> You've probably got like 4 saved up now
[4:50:26] <naoi0> I don't remember there being like a level cap?
[4:50:27] <faithless_zealot> @PatStaresAt You get a fair amount
[4:50:30] <Blank9> closer to kotor 2 than kotor 1
[4:50:32] <ramzyrizzles> why round head floating
[4:50:33] <%blastyoboots> booze!
[4:50:33] <jorniev> if you do tons of side quest
[4:50:34] <+Shonen_hero> and even more in the final cut
[4:50:35] <ZE_Count> Also remember to change your clothes when you see a check modifiers and buffs
[4:50:36] <+mczarklesby> Tons
[4:50:44] <%Monkeyweed21> xp needed to level stays the same
[4:50:48] <the_super_suit> there's not a level cap but eventually too many points become detrimental
[4:50:53] <SelfAwareCanOpener> Depends? At least 20
[4:50:56] <Valentinius_Anodyne> There's not a level-cap as such, but there's only so much exp you can squeeze out of the game
[4:51:03] <aiutare47> @the_super_suit You mean fun?
[4:51:25] <naoi0> I had fun!
[4:51:31] <Visorak6> FOR SURE
[4:51:33] <+Jiggisnipe> IT WAS GREAT
[4:51:35] <naoi0> It's interesting to see all the paths that are available and I didn't do
[4:51:36] <+AugustRei> that was great
[4:51:38] <+Shonen_hero> absolutely
[4:51:41] <+TheCrispyBoi> stream was good
[4:51:48] <the_super_suit> fun until you fuck up the climax and get your buddy ********
[4:51:52] <whymymore> so so good
[4:51:53] <+vnzuelandude> hobo pat did great
[4:51:58] <%RoboticAnimeDude> It was an amazing stream. I will now buy the video game!
[4:51:59] <SelfAwareCanOpener> It was very fun
[4:52:04] <aiutare47> Im watching this because I want to see how you react to this great story
[4:52:05] <A0N33> You did great
[4:52:08] <+twohitgood> makes sense. kinda like what you were doing with undertale?
[4:52:09] <naoi0> @the_super_suit Hey, least you get another guy then
[4:52:10] <+Jiggisnipe> a little
[4:52:11] <Pookiedaexzile> Hobo Pat
[4:52:12] <CatRidder> a patformance
[4:52:14] <$RealThiele> it was good
[4:52:15] <%YakumoYomi> Pat, I watch the stream specifically because you're the one streaming. I show up for YOU, Pat
[4:52:16] <%luftraumm1> here you're gonna have to forget the skill
[4:52:16] <Dr_Mooose> kinda
[4:52:17] <$MachoMadnesss94> oh fuck is the fully voice acted version out?
[4:52:18] <penitentpendant> Even with more VA, you still have to work for it
[4:52:22] <%TheWinged7> it feels like your actual "Role Playing"?
[4:52:25] <aiutare47> its insane
[4:52:25] <%Jack_of_No_Trades> Honestly it was incredible, I am very pumped to see more
[4:52:26] <%Monkeyweed21> Are you a sockpuppet
[4:52:30] <the_super_suit> @naoi0 it's not the same :(
[4:52:31] <jorniev> NOW I CANT
[4:52:33] <Brandon__Brando> @machomadnesss94 ya it's amazing
[4:52:34] <%Dementedpenguin> I remember the original stream and how much you read
[4:52:34] <ZE_Count> its like 90@ less work
[4:52:35] <+red_cuppa> throat murder
[4:52:37] <naoi0> @PatStaresAt Do you feel less tired from your memories of the one-off you did?
[4:52:41] <BiologicGases> holy shit throat would be ded
[4:52:41] <whymymore> will be checking the game out after this stream
[4:52:42] <%RoboticAnimeDude> It's a LOT
[4:52:43] <%luftraumm1> your role is acting, but also comprehending, philosophysing
[4:52:46] <aiutare47> This was the ANTI stream game
[4:53:03] <+Shonen_hero> you still going back to this btw?
[4:53:05] <+TheCrispyBoi> i can't imagine this game without voice acting
[4:53:13] <%whyskeywolfe> Wait Paige is streaming right now?
[4:53:23] <$RealThiele> ELVEN MEN
[4:53:25] <the_super_suit> yes

[4:53:31] <the_super_suit> she's eating mcdonal
[4:53:32] <Pookiedaexzile> Koreans Become Orcs in 7
[4:53:38] <Brandon__Brando> Oh ya fuck that he'll it was too much reading for me without the voiceover
[4:53:39] <aiutare47> NY is so far behind the curve
[4:53:47] <%RoboticAnimeDude> I really like the voice acting, it's weird to think of the game without it
[4:54:02] <$Afterman_> remember, after you get your 2nd shot you have to wait 14 DAYS to be fully protected. If you get the ONE SHOT series, it is 28 DAYS.
[4:54:24] <the_super_suit> still surprised they drop his name so early
[4:54:31] <%MisterRockett> YES
[4:54:34] <%LeiaSkynoober> You're doing so well
[4:54:35] <aiutare47> Interesting take

[4:54:42] <%Maids4lyfe> SUPER COP
[4:54:42] <penitentpendant> All I ask is that you continue pursue the 'case' about why you went on a 3 day bender to destroy your memories
[4:54:43] <jorniev> just dont be an absolute asshole
[4:54:44] <+Shonen_hero> I get that
[4:54:45] <naoi0> Oh yeah the mystery is super interesting
[4:54:45] <%Monkeyweed21> will you be racist or sexist?
[4:54:46] <%Mr_Pylon> Gotta take the case seriously for Kim
[4:54:47] <teefpal> ie Yakuza style
[4:54:48] <jorniev> lz
[4:54:49] <donaghy> savant cop

[4:54:59] <teefpal> you can be a feminist
[4:55:00] <%SilvaChariot0133> <Literally Sorriest Cop on Earth
[4:55:01] <ZE_Count> Im play him as a guy trying to get better but also crazy/dumb
[4:55:05] <naoi0> @BlindGato My first complete playthrough was a sorry cop lol
[4:55:15] <the_super_suit> sorry cop is legit just depressing. in a good way
[4:55:24] <+Shonen_hero> @monkeyweed21 why not both?
[4:55:31] <the_super_suit> apocalypse cop is the true choice
