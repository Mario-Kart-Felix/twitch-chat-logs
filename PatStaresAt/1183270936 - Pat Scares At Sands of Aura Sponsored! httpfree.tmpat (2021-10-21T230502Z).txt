[0:03:00] <%KeiganOfAstora> Is there any way to get Twitch to stop buffering so much? It does it on every resolution, even with a wired connection
[0:03:01] <%NitronStreams> Something something Coarse and rough and gets everywhere.
[0:03:57] <$OranHexthief> @KeiganOfAstora you could try turning off low latency mode if you haven't already
[0:03:58] <armchairmaster_> PastaRatStaresAt
[0:04:10] <%KeiganOfAstora> @OranHexthief Did that. Anything else I can try?

[0:04:59] <MarylandJutsu> @KeiganOfAstora did you go to advanced settings and turn off low latancy?

[0:05:31] <%KeiganOfAstora> It's Pat's fault
[0:05:38] <%KeiganOfAstora> Needs more bandwidth
[0:05:53] <%NitronStreams> pray to the ISP gods and weep for your prayers shall fall upon deaf ears
[0:06:04] <$OranHexthief> @KeiganOfAstora at that point its probably a connection issue. bad wire, poor consistency in isp signal, weird interaction with a browser extention, sometimes even the browser itself if its not one of the big ones
[0:06:29] <%KeiganOfAstora> Chrome. You think Firefox or Opera might be better?
[0:06:37] <%Dova573> stardew valley people making A willy Wonka simulator has me hype
[0:06:41] <PlaidisTheNewPlaid> I can't believe Pat is stealing all of my bandwidth
[0:06:42] <MarylandJutsu> firefox usually works for me
