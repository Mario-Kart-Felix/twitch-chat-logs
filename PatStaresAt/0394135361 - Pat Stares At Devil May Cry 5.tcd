[0:08:02] <@Moobot> Whoa I don't even shout that much! (@masso101) (warning)
[0:08:04] <hotrax> Dante become a piece of pizza and get eated is the most fitting way for him to die
[0:08:06] <+JayEarly> @coreybom did you see that Bethesda immediately disowned it?
[0:08:06] <TheDr0t> shepard dies in the end
[0:08:13] <%The_UnfathoMarble> mah barble though
[0:08:16] <+peri_d0t> pat do you still think hollow knight is one of the best games ever?

[0:09:05] <%haitchkay> @AngriestPat just started ANOTHER New Vegas run thanks to your streams (though CASM seems to be causing crashes and NV anti Crash isn't working?) and I wanted to know if you knew about Fallout 4: New Vegas? It's a full, from the ground up re-make of NV in FO4's engine and has it's own reworked dialog system that mimics the original games and it even has A GOSH DARN TRAITS/SKILLS/PERK FRAMEWORK that works like New Vegas!

[0:09:16] <arcaderabbit48> Wait, what did Bethesda do this time?
[0:09:18] <+Exyoh> I can't believe the Doom straight-to-video movie uses that pipe room from every no budget action movie
[0:09:19] <TheOneUpWarrior> so you guys think they'll add any characters in the bloody palace dlc?
[0:09:22] <hotrax> proto pat

[0:10:59] <%haitchkay> @AngriestPat just started ANOTHER New Vegas run thanks to your streams (though CASM seems to be causing crashes and NV anti Crash isn't working?) and I wanted to know if you knew about Fallout 4: New Vegas? It's a full, from the ground up re-make of NV in FO4's engine and has it's own reworked dialog system that mimics the original games and it even has A GOSH DARN TRAITS/SKILLS/PERK FRAMEWORK that works like New Vegas!

[0:17:54] <$MightyMaxT> That's actually pretty smart
[0:17:55] <%VioletHeart> Or switch it to a trigger.
[0:17:55] <+colon_crush> play dmc with keyboard
[0:17:56] <$ooblagis> I put Griphon on L1
[0:17:56] <%afronooch> cheer500 Can i blame my being bad at DMCV on microtransactions?
[0:17:57] <%VioletHeart> Like a normal person.
[0:18:03] <TranquilTurnip> @ElenaManetta blood sacrifice was definitely involved monkaS
[0:18:03] <$GoogleyGareth> @Dio_TR I think I've got 1 min done out of 3 so I think I'm good so far.
[0:18:03] <$rytyoung> what up Pat, Paige and chat, please gush to me about how good dis game is plz
[0:18:05] <Oqzar> or put the bird on L1

[0:18:05] <Virokwet> GOOD TIP
[0:18:07] <jeffy_dahmer> Love ya pat! Been watching your content since I was 19 (29 now) and your content has helped me through a lot! Thanks so much
[0:18:08] <+SolverCODO> I tried that but it kinda hurts my hand
[0:18:11] <%ElenaManetta> sipsipHellmo
[0:18:13] <Smart_ZaK1> My tip for V is get good
[0:18:20] <%blastazoid26> 5 fucks?
[0:18:22] <dekkitout> Just clean it 4Head
[0:18:23] <%lewdskeletor13> V is a blast to play
[0:18:25] <GameXful2> Imagine eating the fruit and still losing to woohoo pizza man
[0:18:28] <+Polter_ge1st> HI PAT
[0:18:29] <%GohanEgret> apatPorgmo apatPorgmo
[0:18:30] <$valriot> Yeah i just do Griffon on L1, seeing as he rarely needs buffing
[0:18:37] <Dehlome> I'm so ready to watch the end of this
[0:18:43] <Saturdaythe14th> To win with V on normal difficulty just do what Lobos did and literally mash every button as fast as possible
[0:18:47] <%lloyddboy> BOOOOOOOOOO
[0:18:49] <%Alopekis> @blastazoid26 I only donate the finest of fucks.
[0:18:49] <Saturdaythe14th> he kept getting SSS
[0:18:50] <%nitronLVIII> STOP
[0:18:51] <%lewdskeletor13> BOOOO
[0:18:51] <Thunderous_havik> !uptime
[0:18:52] <@Moobot> I've been playing this game for how long? Oh only 18m 54s.
[0:18:52] <Ner234> Ugh....
[0:18:53] <dukenux> Vegan powers have nothing on wacky woohoo pizza style
[0:18:58] <%px120> BOOOOOO
[0:18:58] <$GoogleyGareth> jermaDisgust
[0:18:59] <Dio_TR> @googleygareth that's great, can't wait to see it when it comes out, your Freeman's Mind Video was AMAZING.
[0:19:00] <%blastazoid26> @angriestpat are you using the faust hat much?
[0:19:01] <TheDr0t> snake gonna finally kill liquid
[0:19:02] <%hntronium> Do it tho
[0:19:06] <braaklyn> How would you feel if this game turned out to be utter shit?
[0:19:08] <dekkitout> Woo hoo
[0:19:09] <$valriot> You get SO MANY red orbs anyway
[0:19:10] <TranquilTurnip> "just be bad" - Pat
[0:19:11] <%lloyddboy> WE DO IT
[0:19:12] <%Niney_Who> LET'S GOOOO
[0:19:15] <%CerberusDriver> even Jim Sterling said the MTX arent a problem
[0:19:15] <cosmuck_terror> It is time.
[0:19:17] <cerberuscarmine> do it
[0:19:17] <alrobot2014> is there even an ingame option to access those microtransactions?
[0:19:17] <lucluxx> yeyeyeye
[0:19:19] <%lewdskeletor13> WE DO IT
[0:19:20] <Mnightshyamallama> the amazing thing to me is just how many gold orbs there are in the actual game
[0:19:22] <lionmanguy> The place I live doesn't do daylight savings, this is going to take some getting used to
[0:19:24] <+Badgerconda_> Weird, Pat isn't showing up under live channels for me...
[0:19:26] <+Bloodxb> faust is the best
[0:19:39] <%MarylandJutsu> A WHOLE RORB
[0:19:40] <+mobius_won> Faust is god for grinding
[0:19:41] <%hntronium> You did the big miss
[0:19:43] <TranquilTurnip> tastly delicious orbs
[0:19:49] <%AkronymCLT> The Microtransactions in this game are the least intrusive I've ever seen
[0:19:52] <Dehlome> Did pat show off faust's moves yet? I dont remember seeing what it did beyond increasing rorbs
[0:19:55] <%CerberusDriver> Jim Sterling saying the MTX arent a problem shocked me, dude is usually rabid for that shit.
[0:19:58] <$ooblagis> The last fight also cheats for you the first time through
[0:19:59] <%lewdskeletor13> This among convention with Orbs has gone too far
[0:19:59] <BumblebeeCody> Lol
[0:19:59] <%hntronium> WHAT ABOUT THE EX TAUNT
[0:20:00] <wizardofsiam> stuck on a coach. 7 hours left. send help
[0:20:02] <$rytyoung> can someone tell me all the orb naming conventions?
[0:20:06] <+Exyoh> Rainborb
[0:20:08] <$valriot> Youre not gonna get the cinematic thing in M20 tho :v
[0:20:15] <%haitchkay> cheer100 @AngriestPat just started ANOTHER New Vegas run thanks to your streams and I wanted to know if you knew about Fallout 4: New Vegas? It's a full, from the ground up re-make of NV in FO4's engine and has it's own reworked dialog system that mimics the original games and it even has A GOSH DARN TRAITS/SKILLS/PERK FRAMEWORK that works like New Vegas!
[0:20:15] <%lloyddboy> VERGIL
[0:20:15] <%afronooch> I didn't even know there were any until I saw a twitter thread about em
[0:20:18] <SuperUnhappyman> did pat get the double katalina ann
[0:20:18] <$MightyMaxT> Foolishness
[0:20:23] <%Fenrirlives> V WAS ROBBED
[0:20:23] <%AkronymCLT> @cerberusdriver you honestly could go the whole game without knowing they're there
[0:20:24] <benjiFG> hot
[0:20:25] <reonome> MOTIVATED
[0:20:25] <xtremegamer80> Anyone didn't get anything on the following screen for Pat too?
[0:20:25] <%lewdskeletor13> POWER DANTE
[0:20:25] <%Albadabar> Ver Guile
[0:20:26] <TranquilTurnip> this game allows you to pay to be lazy, thats aabout it
[0:20:26] <vVAstrAVv> pat did you find both kalina anns. its nuts
[0:20:27] <buffmurffy> i ope they get patched out just to remove that one little spot on the game
[0:20:27] <AMajorTom> so really you're doing us a favor by doing whatever you want.
[0:20:27] <+Clik404> @cerberusdriver he’s reasonable enough, usually
[0:20:30] <TheMixedBag> Where's his fedora?
[0:20:34] <cosmuck_terror> Is Vergil feeling motivated tho?
[0:20:34] <person181> has he filled his dark SOUL WITH LIGHT
[0:20:34] <mield916> oh hai vergil
[0:20:34] <shoryukenabotch> Daddy...
[0:20:36] <%ElenaManetta> I haven't even caught up with Woolie's uploads I'm already on another DMC stream aaahhhh
[0:20:37] <benjiFG> vergil is a nerd who loves poetry
[0:20:38] <%hntronium> Virginl
[0:20:38] <GameXful2> DOUBLE KALINA ANN PAT
[0:20:40] <LORDSPOOKLEKINS> BIG DICK ENERGY
[0:20:40] <%Fenrirlives> what Cinematic thing?'
[0:20:42] <devanmuse> They seem compulsory. Like they were put in just because someone wanted them, but no one bothered to justify their existence
[0:20:43] <Saltmeisterr> VURGEL
[0:20:44] <+Javaa01> If you pump up Dr. Faust, you can get like 500k+ orbs by doing mission 13
[0:20:51] <TheDr0t> you can unlock everything after like 1.5 hour of mission 13
[0:20:53] <bsmusic> pog
[0:20:56] <helpmeimafruit> @AngriestPat did you see the video where dante uses dr faust to get 200k rorbs in like 5 minutes? the microtransactions are completely obsolete
[0:20:57] <Bailey__gaming> Kind of Existing I Guess, that's my life story
[0:21:01] <+Bad1uck> DMC5 micro transactions are like "Well Capcom made is do them"
[0:21:02] <Dehlome> pat is using the double kalina anns
[0:21:03] <xtremegamer80> @AngriestPat Yo, your stream didn't show up for some reason
[0:21:07] <masso101> This masterpiece can't be GOTY cuz microtransactions... Jim is such a hack...
[0:21:08] <Bloogoose> 3 Warriors
[0:21:11] <reonome> they made vergil looks so much like nero LUL
[0:21:11] <$valriot> @fenrirlives the "Fuck You!" bit
[0:21:11] <benjiFG> the one where you destroy the enemy spawners
[0:21:11] <bsmusic> yup

[0:22:25] <dukenux> FATHEEEEERRR
[0:22:27] <%GeneralSCPatton> OOF
[0:22:28] <3ncon> did nero not suspect anything when Malphas called him Sparda's kin?
[0:22:30] <%Alopekis> And he hasn't even paid child support
[0:22:30] <%TrevyWeaponsGuy> No, it super wasn't for me

[0:22:33] <alrobot2014> @TranquilTurnip i think that's a twitch ui thing, happening to me too
[0:22:33] <FenixSeraph> Daaaaaaddy
[0:22:35] <emillionghost> futher
[0:22:36] <arran_throttle> FAN FACT: Vergil face model is a Russian model, Maxim Nazarov
[0:22:37] <dekkitout> "He may have been your father, but he wasn't your daddy"
[0:22:37] <Dehlome> Nero inherited the daaaaaaaady
[0:22:37] <%lewdskeletor13> THATS NOT TRUE
[0:22:38] <%Rngiddion> It not in my follows either Twitch is being fucky tonight
[0:22:38] <JustTaven> D:
[0:22:38] <reonome> ffuuuuuther
[0:22:39] <%Radoh> Why would Nero even care?
[0:22:39] <xtremegamer80> @AngriestPat I will send you a screenshot of it to prove to you that I am not
[0:22:39] <masso101> Yo woolie got it in one though, I bet that was agonizing for you, not being able to talk about v
[0:22:40] <$rytyoung> nooooooooo
[0:22:40] <Dio_TR> @elenamanetta this is Pat's livelyhood now he can't fuck up

[0:22:52] <Dragon_Batman> nah who cares killing demons
[0:22:52] <LORDSPOOKLEKINS> Futherrrrrrrrrrrrr
[0:22:52] <%ElenaManetta> Nero looks like he has something in his eye
[0:22:53] <TranquilTurnip> prank my dad
[0:22:53] <%starotter70> no, why
[0:22:53] <dukenux> "No it's not true... IT'S NOT POSSIBLE!"
[0:22:54] <$ooblagis> The White Hair? WHAT ABOUT THE GIANT DEMON ARM
[0:22:54] <%hntronium> duddy
[0:22:55] <+Despera__> !uptime
[0:22:55] <@Moobot> I've been playing this game for how long? Oh only 22m 57s.
[0:22:55] <$rytyoung> Nero skywalker
[0:22:56] <%AncelDeLambert> shit happens pretty fast, Pat
[0:22:56] <Ser_Randal> Nero is not the brightest lad
[0:22:58] <jinking79> twitch was fucking up
[0:22:58] <%nmaten> or the DEVIL ARM???
[0:22:59] <%ElenaManetta> Is it tears?
[0:22:59] <Valdorick> Wait... HE DIDN'T KNOW DANTE WAS HIS UNCLE!?
[0:23:00] <Seitine> CHI CHI
[0:23:01] <%GeneralSCPatton> Is the Yamato just the Sword of Actuation?
[0:23:03] <th3madness> It worked out for lady though?
[0:23:03] <zeldamaster52> Uncle Dante!
[0:23:07] <$cureneckbeard> I just assumed he had white hair because he was old
[0:23:09] <%Birdigalore> @AngriestPat Devil Sword Dante looks like a Nergigante weapon lol
[0:23:10] <%Tarcanist_> I'M SINGING IN THE RAIN, JUST SINGING IN THE RAIN! WHAT A GLORIOUS FEELING, I'M HAPPY AGAIN! pat
[0:23:10] <TranquilTurnip> may fasha
[0:23:11] <+SolverCODO> They probably just made something up
[0:23:12] <%DrWolpertinger> ok but is this not the best moment? it's super soap opera but also it's very cool
[0:23:13] <sangi53> We've seen in DMC3 how dante reacts to sad backstories
[0:23:15] <+miguelrod777> probably thought Dante was his dad
[0:23:17] <helpmeimafruit> did nero and dante just not interact at all after DMC4?
[0:23:17] <%Klefth> But he's been called descendant of Sparda before, too!
[0:23:18] <+Tentacruelty_> It had to have come up but Dante probably brushed it off
[0:23:18] <%Halowood> It's almost like Dante was intentionally not telling him
[0:23:19] <dekkitout> Did he assume Dante was his dad?
[0:23:20] <ratcan_> @AngriestPat apparently twitch has a thing called smart notifs now, which only sends a few, so you have to go into settings on mobile to disable it
[0:23:20] <+redstonej> he is your PA PA
[0:23:20] <Dragovus> Nero was told he had the blood of Sparda but never connected that he and Dante are related
[0:23:20] <PlatinumOki> Never mentioned he was his dad, Let alone mention Vergil EVER
[0:23:21] <$PaleBloodInk> Because look at Dante? Could you actually picture that man having sex?
[0:23:21] <%lewdskeletor13> Dante don’t wanna talk about it
[0:23:21] <emillionghost> HeyGuys
[0:23:21] <TyrantBelial> I will say
[0:23:21] <%MagickBurritoh> Nero looks like he needs more power
[0:23:22] <buffmurffy> how long have dante and nero hung out tho?
[0:23:22] <%SrG00SE> it also means V who looks kinda younger than him was also his dad
[0:23:22] <TyrantBelial> nero's
[0:23:23] <%Kreegmeyer> I feel like Dante probably dodged that shit hardcore lmao
[0:23:23] <krksobk> we space now
[0:23:24] <+bubbli97> @AngriestPat Dante probably never wanted to talk about it, i guess
[0:23:25] <Dalkalopagus> I think the idea is Dante didn't want him to know
[0:23:25] <%CerberusDriver> he thought Dante was his dad prolly
[0:23:26] <Psyramics> why would it? 'btw, my brother, who's been dead for years, is your father'
[0:23:27] <Dehlome> To be fair, Nero probably thought he was super different because of his arm
[0:23:27] <$rytyoung> SPACE
[0:23:29] <dukenux> get out with this Evangelion shit
[0:23:30] <%Albadabar> Motivation Tree
[0:23:31] <dosan121> It's not like we have the same stupid white hair anime protagonist trope on our genetics!
[0:23:33] <bsmusic> NOT MY DEAR PAPA
[0:23:34] <LORDSPOOKLEKINS> SHHHH
[0:23:34] <TyrantBelial> "THEN WHAT IS IT THEN?!" is the most visceral yell in all the games
[0:23:36] <%ElenaManetta> Did Pat see the billion red orb special taunts?
[0:23:36] <%Alopekis> Why don't they just nuke it?
[0:23:36] <TheDr0t> @angriestpat does they explain how vergil got back to life after dante killing him?
[0:23:37] <%lewdskeletor13> SPACE MOTIVATION
[0:23:37] <cosmuck_terror> Treeeeeeees iiiiiiiin spaaaaaaaace!
[0:23:37] <$valriot> Chilling in his boss fight arena
[0:23:39] <masso101> If Dante eats pizza, then what does Vergil eat?
[0:23:39] <TranquilTurnip> no gravity in space
[0:23:40] <%ElenaManetta> They've been uploaded since last stream
[0:23:44] <%dreamfillah> WOULDAour
[0:23:44] <DetroitSentai> what difficulty is this?
[0:23:45] <Dragon_Batman> i dunno I would think it weird he asks Dante who he never met till 4, hey do you know who my father is?
[0:23:46] <%AncelDeLambert> that thing is tall enough to suffer gravitational tidal forces
[0:23:46] <$cureneckbeard> The space elevator
[0:23:47] <%starotter70> I like to think its because Dante's just a lazy ass
[0:23:48] <%Tarheelg23> oh man his voice is so good
[0:23:49] <bsmusic> Oh hi V
[0:23:49] <GameXful2> what an edgelord
[0:23:51] <alrobot2014> your LAIFE
[0:23:51] <Imbetweenjobs_> virgil has a fat baby face
[0:23:51] <dukenux> LUL
[0:23:52] <+Das_Prints> Well he apparently didn’t know Vergil even existed until about 20 minutes ago.
[0:23:52] <%MagickBurritoh> Old Vergil looks weird
[0:23:54] <%AkronymCLT> Imagine if Vergil was the woohoo pizza man
[0:23:54] <+Kavtech> Who?
[0:23:55] <$ooblagis> Look at this emo, chuuni asshole
[0:23:56] <xtremegamer80> @AngriestPat Okay so it shows on the mobile app but not the website??
[0:23:56] <Mr_Strut> Dante would be going, "I need more pizza."
[0:23:57] <%Alopekis> Vergil looks super weird
[0:23:58] <FenixSeraph> this Vergil has a big ass chin
[0:23:58] <$rytyoung> has there ever been a space set piece in DMC before?
[0:23:58] <dukenux> Illusive Vergil
[0:24:04] <person181> i like how much more black he has on
[0:24:04] <Buttku> @angriestpat you gonna let us see all the cool shit the next boss can do?
[0:24:05] <Valdorick> No Virgil, because you read poetry while Dante was a momma's boy.
[0:24:07] <$valriot> His face is so perfect tho
[0:24:07] <+Bloodxb> i like it
[0:24:08] <%dreamfillah> He's got a huge receding hairline
[0:24:09] <%skizzuto> his coat is so clean and shiny compared to dante and nero's
[0:24:11] <%MoraMiarty> God vergil is the coolest weeb ever
[0:24:11] <%hntronium> Is it just me or does old virgil look like he's balding?
[0:24:12] <sangi53> wait what?
[0:24:13] <dukenux> Well Dante looks like Clancy Brown now
[0:24:16] <%hntronium> LADY
[0:24:19] <Dehlome> hes got good skin for being fucked up for so long
[0:24:20] <AMajorTom> I wanted a new mission. And for my crimes, they gave me one
[0:24:21] <%Albadabar> I think it's his tiny eyebrows and huuuuge eyebrow space
[0:24:23] <dukenux> So it's only fair Vergil looks like Martin Sheen
[0:24:24] <$KnivesEve> hello
[0:24:25] <TakesGuts> he looks great
[0:24:26] <%King_Wulgard> damn vergil looks good
[0:24:26] <DetroitSentai> Just a really high hairline
[0:24:28] <bonzosan> virgil is 37 or something
[0:24:29] <Mnightshyamallama> the big forehead is what gets me
[0:24:31] <SkyPirateArcane> YEYEYE
[0:24:31] <%AkronymCLT> @dukenux especially in the concept art
[0:24:31] <Dragon_Batman> I think it's the swept back hair, but I like it
[0:24:32] <TheDr0t> @angriestpat does they explain how vergil got back to life after dante killing him?
[0:24:32] <reonome> YEYEYEYEYE
[0:24:32] <thelonechris> PogChamp
[0:24:32] <%Klefth> Well, that's cause it's no longer anime hair
[0:24:37] <Imbetweenjobs_> hair is too close to his skin and no eyebrows
[0:24:37] <dekkitout> Did Dante sum up the franchise in a sentence?
[0:24:39] <$KnivesEve> miss anything?
[0:24:40] <benjiFG> here it comes
[0:24:41] <arran_throttle> Face Motion capture of Vergil for this game was Maxim Nazarov, some russian model
[0:24:43] <%Alopekis> Ol' Douchebag
[0:24:43] <$ooblagis> That's my favorite line
[0:24:44] <zeldamaster52> Bazooka!
[0:24:46] <Dragon_Batman> although he doesn't have the front spike
[0:24:47] <%lewdskeletor13> DOUBLE KALINA ANN
[0:24:48] <lucluxx> yeah it takes getting used to
[0:24:49] <Ser_Randal> HE SAID THE D WORD
[0:24:49] <SuperUnhappyman> double katalina
[0:24:49] <helpmeimafruit> The popularity of DMC5 is leading to a whole new generation of people who never played the previous games complaining that Vergil's voice is lame, it makes me sad
[0:24:50] <DarkSideCow> he never gives that weapon back
[0:24:51] <%Dr00_PhD> His mouth didnt move at all
[0:24:53] <dukenux> wait
[0:24:54] <HoIlywood_SN> @AngriestPat you notice how Reuben is like breathing out every single line in this game? He's like sighing out every word
[0:24:54] <DatAsuna> It's really not explained
[0:24:55] <bsmusic> LUL
[0:24:56] <PlatinumOki> Is it tho?
[0:24:56] <GameXful2> HERE'S THE DOUBLE KA
[0:24:59] <$ooblagis> No, they why he was still around to take Nero's arm
[0:25:00] <alrobot2014> he ate the people fruit
[0:25:01] <$valriot> Cos Dante and Vergil are like, 45-50 and have 25 year old hair cuts
[0:25:03] <PlatinumOki> Vergil just shows up at Nero's garage
[0:25:04] <Smart_ZaK1> is it?
[0:25:04] <+mcjimbo12> They don't explain how Vergil went from DMC1 to DMC5
[0:25:05] <DatAsuna> It's massively glossed over
[0:25:10] <%Niney_Who> Dante fucking murdered DMC1 Vergil
[0:25:13] <Prevot> so how do you guys feel about this game's plot basically being that one DBZ movie?
[0:25:13] <Manwad> its like when a hearltess and a nobody fuse
[0:25:16] <dukenux> HOW did Niko get her- you know what, nvm
[0:25:18] <%ShaneWhite> Dang it I’m late to the show!
[0:25:19] <Dehlome> vergil is just so powerful he fought his way out of hell
[0:25:21] <LORDSPOOKLEKINS> This fucking sword is so cool
[0:25:21] <fairore> @helpmeimafruit well that bs
[0:25:21] <%Birdigalore> @AngriestPat Has it ever been explained why they're so obsessed with fighting each other?
[0:25:22] <+JayEarly> @helpmeimafruit they’ll learn, they all learn to respect this devil’s power
[0:25:23] <$ooblagis> I think it's described in a file or something that he reforms in hell. I forget
[0:25:23] <Seitine> Vergil is Eve and ate the apple like the little bitch he is.
[0:25:23] <+PanicSwytch> Technically he didn't die as Nelo Angelo
[0:25:26] <%Albadabar> He was "hurt real bad" but that's it
[0:25:27] <PlatinumOki> Like last we saw Vergil he blew up into a flash of lightning
[0:25:28] <VritraReiRei> @AngriestPat i just realized, didn't you sued to break down your Youtube videos into smaller parts and put thumbnails? Whatever happened to that?
[0:25:28] <DetroitSentai> He wandered the demon realm as a broken husk for like 20 years
[0:25:32] <SubjectX07x> aaaahshit did I miss Dante dance time?
[0:25:33] <devanmuse> @AngriestPat I think they meant "How was he alive to take Nero's Arm if Dante killed the shit out of him as Nelo Angelo"
[0:25:35] <+Clik404> @niney_who to be fair, you never see Nelo Angelo die, just fly away
[0:25:37] <dukenux> I dorgot how pumped up Dante is
[0:25:39] <jinking79> least Pat isn't on a lvl for 4 hours
[0:25:39] <%JustToWatch> @AngriestPat how did he go from 1 to 5
[0:25:39] <42nfl19> Woah, your mom let's you have TWO Kalina Anns?
[0:25:41] <%GeneralSCPatton> Qlipphoth looks like a giant dandelion puff. Is it going to explode into the solar wind and contaminate other planets, like Kill La Kill?
[0:25:42] <+Sulfur_Boride> I think Pat's Stand is taking effect again, cuz they don't explain how Vergil was able to come back and to find Nero in the garage
[0:25:45] <%MagickBurritoh> Dempsy roll
[0:25:45] <321Continue> 1 MILLION RORBS
[0:25:47] <masso101> Every weapon in this game is the best weapon in the series
[0:25:47] <Mnightshyamallama> idk how i feel about prop shredder not being on O even if magic swords are cool
[0:25:48] <Dragon_Batman> Cerberus tho
[0:25:49] <krksobk> IGNITE THE FLAME.......
[0:25:49] <GameXful2> IGNITE THE FLAAAAMES
[0:25:49] <%Alopekis> Oh. You get the weird nunchucks again :O
[0:25:49] <%MoraMiarty> Devil Sword Dante is hands down the best addition to his arsenal
[0:25:50] <RantingRavager> IGNITE THE FLAME
[0:25:54] <krksobk> N O W
[0:25:54] <%nitronLVIII> Did you know according to the wiki Vergil's face isnt Dan Southworth, but actually some guy named "Maxim Nazarov"
[0:25:54] <helpmeimafruit> @AngriestPat is it optimal to just mash swordmaster with Devil Sword Dante all the time?
[0:25:55] <%AkronymCLT> It fucked me up so much that they switch ariel rave to triangle
[0:25:56] <$valriot> You better RG the shit out of Vergil >:c
[0:26:00] <mayorrev> All these stylish moves and yet you're only gonna get B ranks Kappa
[0:26:01] <Mr_Strut> But the EX taunt tho
[0:26:04] <$Sphincter_Spelunker> Did we just start gameplay? I rushed the end of the last VOD
[0:26:05] <321Continue> LOOK AT ALL THOSE RORBS
[0:26:14] <%Albadabar> Only 2 mil more before you can get the final move Pat apatLiz

[0:26:16] <+JayEarly> DAMN I’m good!
[0:26:16] <RealPT1> is there any account for where and what vergil was doing during DMC4?

[0:27:49] <%MagickBurritoh> Jesus
[0:27:49] <MForan98> @Birdigalore V says way when Dante fights full Power urizen "They fundamentally disagree on why they exist" and DMC 3 has the a monologue about how "They seemed to find some twisted pleasure in fighting" with the games intro
[0:27:53] <%H0rnedG0d> hey stream
[0:28:01] <fairore> @emillionghost yso you hate fun

[0:28:49] <emillionghost> @fairore wahoo is good. he should say nothing else
[0:28:50] <+JayEarly> Is Dante in DMC5 the greatest action game character of all time?
[0:28:52] <sangi53> I still don't get twosome time
[0:28:58] <nthdimensional> Is there Suplexes in this game?
[0:29:05] <Valdorick> Yes, but for Nero
[0:29:06] <3ncon> nero has them
[0:29:06] <dekkitout> *Mesa Shooting Gallery Intensifies*
[0:29:08] <fairore> @emillionghost worst opinion
[0:29:09] <masso101> @jayearly that'd be nero
[0:29:10] <%Adam_Wayne> @sangi53 it lets you shoot multiple enemies in different directions
[0:29:13] <Make_me_mad> Finally beat Urizen in the prologue.
[0:29:14] <TheWildVlad> ice age move is back to forward with SM style button
[0:29:14] <KawaiiJetty> Gun stinger sounds stupid rofl
[0:29:18] <+mcjimbo12> @JayEarly postgame nero
[0:29:19] <$valriot> Rainstorm so gooood in this for style and dealing with circle summon swords
[0:29:24] <Shimmying_skeleton> suprised cant extend the firecracker move with coyote
[0:29:25] <sangi53> @Adam_Wayne yeah but it's not that useful honestly

[0:30:04] <%CerberusDriver> Pat has beaten the game like 5 times

[0:31:23] <Dragon_Batman> That's awesome
[0:31:23] <%CerberusDriver> that Griffon DMC1 theme
[0:31:24] <PlatinumOki> Kamiya is rolling in his grave
[0:31:25] <HedgehogGames1> Let's go back to Mallet Island!
[0:31:26] <%Adam_Wayne> Rebellion vs. Sparda vs. Dante, which is best sword
[0:31:27] <Ninjagregory98> Why?

[0:31:37] <%Tarheelg23> THE MUSIC
[0:31:37] <+Hoovyking1> Flock off, featherface.
[0:31:37] <%alexandrecau> Nero can power bomb with his buster and do ddt but not sure he can do suplexes
[0:31:37] <+KaiserCrimson_1> BibleThump
[0:31:38] <+DeRedBaron> the music gets better yo
[0:31:40] <%vaporousTippler> Fuck yes. This theme was great.
[0:31:40] <+Lunarthewolf> FLOCK OFF FEATHERFACE
[0:31:41] <+JayEarly> @adam_wayne DANTE
[0:31:43] <%skizzuto> but these guys can't kill anyone on their own when you're playing as V
[0:31:45] <GameXful2> F L OC K O F F
[0:31:45] <TyrantBelial> Too bad he doesn't becomne his original size
[0:31:47] <masso101> I saw some edgelord on twitter say they would rather have DmC 2 than DMC5 just to piss off the "elitist fanboys." Literally the worst thing I've read on the internet.
[0:31:54] <%PeaceCentennial> I wish we could use this theme for the battle theme
[0:31:54] <Dragon_Batman> yeyeyeye
[0:31:54] <%Klefth> Remember to use the summon swords, too
[0:31:58] <%lewdskeletor13> @skizzuto They can’t kill demons
[0:32:00] <%PeaceCentennial> gotta wait for those music mods
[0:32:01] <benjiFG> he said it
[0:32:05] <%BigNerdSam> FLOCK OFF FEATHERFACE
[0:32:07] <Bloogoose> DMC2 it
[0:32:18] <Morning_Asakura> dmc 2 that shit
[0:32:19] <%ScreamingMeat> @
[0:32:28] <Seitine> It'd be interesting if their strength was influenced by how much you leveled V's moves.
[0:32:32] <%skizzuto> @lewdskeletor13 so half-demons are fair game then?
[0:32:32] <PlatinumOki> Old days would be grenade launcher + DT + jump spam
[0:32:36] <Videogamer4> LUL
[0:32:39] <%alexandrecau> I'm getting star---TIME OUT
[0:32:40] <%AncelDeLambert> awww, not the full boss fight?
[0:32:42] <+juandead> Lol you mean dmc1 cuz that’s how you beat griffon in 1. Shoot him to death
[0:32:43] <%Klefth> Charge sword formation, too. It adds a shitton of damage
[0:32:45] <axelcezar> damn this game is good
[0:32:49] <%Adam_Wayne> anyone know any good royal guard cancels yet
[0:32:50] <%TheNewJapanGuy> woolieSCARED
[0:32:53] <321Continue> MILLION RORBS
[0:32:53] <+PleasantLee> 2 mill more to go
[0:32:55] <%hntronium> NOW GET 2 MILLION MORE
[0:32:55] <%AncelDeLambert> he bought them
[0:32:56] <%Tarcanist_> I'M SINGING IN THE RAIN, JUST SINGING IN THE RAIN! WHAT A GLORIOUS FEELING, I'M HAPPY AGAIN! pat
[0:32:58] <$Sphincter_Spelunker> "So I grinded offscreen"
[0:32:59] <%Dr_DangerPhD> @masso101 during max's stream of dmc2 there were people legit trying to defend the game lol
[0:33:04] <cerberuscarmine> lies
[0:33:06] <DetroitSentai> Did you not see his 40+hours that was tweeted
[0:33:06] <%PeaceCentennial> So is Dante the best sword Dante has ever had?
[0:33:07] <+Bloodxb> would of had 2 mill with dr faust
[0:33:07] <%NopeBadguy> MICROTRANSACTIONS
[0:33:08] <$NocturneNovember> 8 million if Pat wants all three
[0:33:08] <cerberuscarmine> got it with MONEY
[0:33:09] <42nfl19> @AngriestPat can you confirm if upgrading V upgrades this boss fight?
[0:33:10] <Valdorick> "So I cheated"
[0:33:11] <Damashi_The_Kaotic> What mission do you use for orb grinding?
[0:33:12] <Dehlome> goddamn those summon swords are so fuckign cool
[0:33:13] <%PeaceCentennial> I think it is
[0:33:16] <devanmuse> The Dante Sword: it plays the game for you
[0:33:16] <DarkSideCow> dantes circle move with his swords can be used with normal combos so you can throw it into your combos
[0:33:17] <%Albadabar> You're almost there Pat, stay Motivated
[0:33:17] <$HentaiSenpai9K> The 3 million taunts are super diss2
[0:33:18] <dekkitout> Nest~
[0:33:18] <%furiousfurioso> rooPog
[0:33:19] <Bloogoose> Distort that Real Impact you coward
[0:33:20] <Archmortal> just 8 million more to earn!
[0:33:22] <+PleasantLee> I cant believe they gave dante summon swords and a 2nd DT, its nuts
[0:33:23] <$HentaiSenpai9K> dissapointing
[0:33:24] <%Adam_Wayne> if you want to earn a buttload of orbs do mission 13, the area after the goddess statue, dr. faust gunslinger
[0:33:26] <%skizzuto> those were indeed some sick skills
[0:33:27] <PlatinumOki> Why is Balrog the best punch gloves
[0:33:27] <%Adam_Wayne> and then repeat
[0:33:27] <dukenux> How far did max get into DMC2
[0:33:29] <janus_the_captive> deezam
[0:33:32] <%alexandrecau> I mean Faust makes farming for orb pretty easy
[0:33:33] <%AncelDeLambert> shorYUKEN
[0:33:35] <Eger007> that weapon reminds me of that angel weapon from dmc
[0:33:38] <bonzosan> honestly this games feels like a sequel to dmc4 and spiritual sequel to DmC, plot wise
[0:33:38] <dukenux> Cause Clemps streamed it, and just couldn't do it LUL
[0:33:41] <$NocturneNovember> Max beat Dante's route and left it at that
[0:33:42] <GameXful2> @AngriestPat can you distort it ?
[0:33:48] <TyrantBelial> I can't believe Balrog is the announcer.
[0:33:50] <majindusto> Max is a huge Coward = Confirmed
[0:33:54] <%Klefth> Getting a million rorbs is easy. Just spam Dr. Faust in Mission 13
[0:33:55] <$Sphincter_Spelunker> @PleasantLee Summoned swords were with Lucifer from 4. 2nd DT is expanded from 2
[0:33:57] <$ooblagis> You can
[0:33:58] <abakkus> i assume you probably heard @AngriestPat but apparently some people hacked save data to see the 3mil orb cutscenes, so those are a known thing now. not sure if anyone has them legit yet tho?
[0:34:00] <+JayEarly> @platinumoki because it loves this shit, just like Dante
[0:34:01] <Bloogoose> You can distort it
[0:34:01] <Shimmying_skeleton> dude berial is the best fist weapon in thd series so much fun and vvariety
[0:34:03] <%PeaceCentennial> Distorted Real Impact feels really weird in this game
[0:34:06] <DonStylow> the 3 million taunts are worth every goddamn orb.
[0:34:06] <%Keaton_x> I'm sitting on 250k just from replaying the demo over and over again... I should buy the full game..
[0:34:09] <filthydrongo> i wish dante could ride the motor cycle instead of sprint
[0:34:09] <reonome> its fiiiiiiine
[0:34:10] <SquiglyBattleOpera> You can't distort in this game
[0:34:13] <DraxTD> funny how that fit in like a PERFECT puzzle Pice @AngriestPat
[0:34:17] <+HotBloodedHero> Just booted up the game to find even Patty has a title screen read.
[0:34:17] <%NopeBadguy> no distort
[0:34:18] <+Shastafield> LUL
[0:34:20] <%weissguard> IT'S Fiiiiiiiine
[0:34:28] <LORDSPOOKLEKINS> every single one of dantes weapons is the best
[0:34:30] <%H0rnedG0d> fuck
[0:34:30] <%AncelDeLambert> yeye eat shit Pat so I can feel better about myself!
[0:34:32] <%Toynota10> So Pat, when we getting that Combo mad montage video?
[0:34:32] <%Adam_Wayne> @ooblagis there's supposed to be a cutscene?
[0:34:33] <xtremegamer80> @AngriestPat Vergil: "Geee Dante, why does D-Daddy let you have two DTs and a better summoned swords?" Dante: "Wooohooo pizza party woo m-mother!"
[0:34:35] <42nfl19> @AngriestPat does upgrading V upgrade these boss fights?
[0:34:38] <TheDr0t> @abakkus i got all 3 of them legit
[0:34:38] <+PleasantLee> @Sphincter_Spelunker lucifer is a devil arms and not dantes own power. critical DT in DMC2 didnt work anything like Sin DT
[0:34:40] <%Adam_Wayne> @ooblagis I have the EX for dante

[0:35:10] <+Polter_ge1st> doodLewd doodLewd doodLewd
[0:35:11] <%VioletHeart> That explains why I never saw Nightmare use Skewer.
[0:35:12] <+Gamefriendly> SANDBAG V NEVER UPGRADE
[0:35:12] <Oqzar> I never bought the laser and nightmare still did it
[0:35:13] <$rytyoung> 12/10
[0:35:13] <HunterMGlengi> hi i don't normally gunslinger but i'm in love with rainstorm in this game
[0:35:14] <DetroitSentai> Does it? When I fought it saw a buncha moves that I NEVER BOUGHT.
[0:35:15] <+Sp3ctre48> Does it really?
[0:35:15] <$ooblagis> @Adam_Wayne ???
[0:35:16] <+Bad1uck> whoa, expectations EXCEEDED
[0:35:17] <+DeRedBaron> omg, well that explains why you said "and im done buying moves with V cus this is his last mission" @AngriestPat
[0:35:17] <$Sphincter_Spelunker> @PleasantLee Sure, not his own. But the base is there, gameplay wise.
[0:35:17] <TyrantBelial> So is V fully upgraded in this fight?
[0:35:18] <%Dr00_PhD> Wait does that mean you can walk on skewers?
[0:35:19] <Saturdaythe14th> Are you sure? The questionable move is Nightmare doing skewer or not
[0:35:19] <Seitine> Dude that detail is just so fucking good.
[0:35:20] <%sshen> Pat will you be running live action for SoS?
[0:35:22] <%TheNewJapanGuy> sbfpSweetbaby sbfpSweetbaby sbfpSweetbaby sbfpSweetbaby
[0:35:23] <dukenux> This has to be Crazy Talk
[0:35:24] <Saturdaythe14th> but I think he only does skewer on the last fight?

[0:35:41] <NivekMD> SourPls
[0:35:41] <televisedrevolting> That is super good! I just thought they'd be end game no matter how you upgraded them.
[0:35:41] <+DeRedBaron> and it's remixed too
[0:35:42] <%lewdskeletor13> @toynota10 No
[0:35:42] <3ncon> can you instakill shadow if he uses skewer
[0:35:42] <%Toynota10> I fucking LOVE Psycho Siren
[0:35:43] <%AncelDeLambert> so what I'm hearing is this game is just FFX?
[0:35:43] <VritraReiRei> don't upgrade V for an easier boss fight in the future? 🤔
[0:35:45] <Seitine> This game is just so fucking extra and I love it.

[0:35:50] <fairore> @redanimator thats dum
[0:35:51] <%Beough> This game is so awesome!
[0:35:53] <Fujiwara_92> Just got here, did I lose much?
[0:35:54] <%SrG00SE> oh boy hes intimidating when you're facing him down huh..
[0:35:55] <$ooblagis> @Adam_Wayne No, that must have been someone else
[0:35:55] <%Toynota10> is he on DMD mode then?
[0:36:00] <pectusumbra> Elmo's shadow, THE TRUE SELF
[0:36:01] <%Adam_Wayne> @ooblagis oops my bad
[0:36:02] <+PanicSwytch> Its Elmo
[0:36:02] <prime_name> Not the good boys...
[0:36:03] <+Bloodxb> elmo black
[0:36:04] <DetroitSentai> It's not true im pretty sure, i saw it use moves I didnt buy on my first playthrough. Probably difficulty dependent @AngriestPat
[0:36:05] <%PeaceCentennial> yo where your RG at, pat
[0:36:05] <%Lithdoran> !uptime
[0:36:05] <@Moobot> I've been playing this game for how long? Oh only 36m 7s.
[0:36:07] <%3xgilly> expectations exceeded again
[0:36:07] <$rytyoung> He gave me sooooo much trouble on DMC 1
[0:36:11] <$ooblagis> @Adam_Wayne np
[0:36:14] <Saturdaythe14th> Yeah i don't think that upgrade thing is true because shadow only does these attacks this time
[0:36:17] <mayorrev> WAH TOOOOOH
[0:36:23] <sangi53> I really want the OST to come out man
[0:36:28] <%lewdskeletor13> @toynota10 He’s starting Son of Sparda after this
[0:36:30] <IsaiahOmega> if you're gonna shoot you should just use gunslinger man
[0:36:31] <$rytyoung> hmm crazy talk activated?
[0:36:35] <%PeaceCentennial> ok so Dante's swords in DT are the fucking coolest
[0:36:35] <+JayEarly> Shadow’s ai is like Elmo sometimes, dumb, but does the best he can
[0:36:36] <%Adam_Wayne> @abakkus what cutscene were you talking about for 3 mil
[0:36:37] <$D4C_Trice> real impact destroys him in his orb state
[0:36:40] <$Sphincter_Spelunker> @PleasantLee I'm just splitting hairs on you saying you couldn't believe they gave Dante this stuff. Sorry
[0:36:41] <%PeaceCentennial> if you're in RG, they auto block for you
[0:36:44] <%TheNewJapanGuy> woolieSCARED sbfpSweetbaby woolieSCARED
[0:36:45] <benjiFG> can you continuously do the bite as V or is that only in this fight?
[0:36:47] <+KaiserCrimson_1> Can you still oneshot him when he does the Skewer attack like in DMC1?
[0:36:48] <DraxTD> To see a World in a Grain of Sand And a Heaven in a Wild Flower Hold Infinity in the palm of your hand
[0:36:49] <%Alopekis> Poor kitty
[0:36:49] <Archmortal> That's fucked up
[0:36:54] <+PleasantLee> @Sphincter_Spelunker its fine
[0:36:57] <%bevyrage> you can spam that bite
[0:36:59] <+DeRedBaron> only big diff is you can actually hit him with his weapon before he turns into his core
[0:37:01] <%lloyddboy> CAN YOU DO THE INSTAKILL
[0:37:01] <%lewdskeletor13> apatWink apatWink apatWink apatWink apatWink

[0:37:07] <GameXful2> yes
[0:37:08] <Them00n> @AngriestPat Are you disappointed V isn't coming back for the sequel?
[0:37:09] <+krawtch> it was a remix
[0:37:09] <+Clik404> WOOOO
[0:37:13] <Oqzar> they can fuck up your launches tho
[0:37:14] <@commanderclaw> I S ranked Chapter 19 via heavy royal guard use
[0:37:17] <%PeaceCentennial> I didn't have an issue with this fight at all
[0:37:18] <%BigNerdSam> Dante's new Round Trip is the best.
[0:37:24] <TyrantBelial> So, there's something I weant to point out that makes me feel bad, and Dante pointsi t out too.
[0:37:28] <%PeaceCentennial> just use air trick to get up to griffon
[0:37:30] <+JayEarly> @commanderclaw me too
[0:37:31] <%Toynota10> @angriestpat missed your last couple streams. who you like best in this game?
[0:37:36] <%starotter70> Man, [Blank] has never been better
[0:37:40] <+Clik404> @commanderclaw same here, Royal Guard for life!
[0:37:44] <TheDr0t> @angriestpat but was virgil alive to take neros arm?
[0:37:51] <TranquilTurnip> Are these enemies even dangerous or just to style on at this point?
[0:37:53] <sangi53> @AngriestPat hey pat do you feel like majin DT is too strong and makes the game easy af?
[0:37:55] <$Sphincter_Spelunker> When does Dante fuck. Vergil fucks
[0:37:59] <%lewdskeletor13> @thedr0t Yes he was alive
[0:38:01] <%Adam_Wayne> @TranquilTurnip they're to get rorbs
[0:38:02] <%bevyrage> that's a good finish
[0:38:04] <%H0rnedG0d> heycoolguy
[0:38:04] <Prevot> Clap
[0:38:04] <+BulletproofMoon> favorite weapon and style for Dante?
[0:38:05] <$valriot> Ceeberus is amazing is this game, only weapon i dont like is the bike, its just too slow for me
[0:38:08] <%skizzuto> Dante, are the high-pitched whooping noises really necessary
[0:38:09] <GameXful2> @AngriestPat opinion on the new subhuman ?
[0:38:09] <dukenux> Empusas are just style bitches at this point
[0:38:10] <Dragon_Batman> Beating those 3?
[0:38:10] <+JayEarly> Royal Guard: not just for superhumans anymore
[0:38:11] <%PeaceCentennial> Majin DT is not that strong in the later difficulties
[0:38:14] <dukenux> well and rorb tanks
[0:38:17] <TranquilTurnip> @Adam_Wayne figured yeah they looked hardly threatening
[0:38:18] <%AncelDeLambert> @AngriestPat what playthrough are you on now?
[0:38:18] <%TrevyWeaponsGuy> @skizzuto YES
[0:38:22] <TheDr0t> @lewdskeletor13 but how? he got killed in dmc1
[0:38:23] <+Clik404> @tranquilturnip they get an attack in SoS mode
[0:38:24] <$D4C_Trice> I don't like royal guard but I feel like I will have to learn how to use it on the repeat urizen and Vergil fights
[0:38:24] <Dragon_Batman> neat
[0:38:24] <$NocturneNovember> The only time Dante fucks is when he pulls a McChicken on a pizza
[0:38:28] <$rytyoung> @thedr0t Vergil took yamato from Nero, that was the reason for taking his arm
[0:38:32] <$valriot> ROYAL GUARD THESE FUCKS
[0:38:36] <%AncelDeLambert> four already?
[0:38:48] <%Toynota10> @angriestpat Who you like better? Nero or Dante?
[0:38:54] <%sshen> whens live action playthrough pat
[0:38:54] <helpmeimafruit> royal guard feels super broken now
[0:38:57] <LORDSPOOKLEKINS> @AncelDeLambert he got it early
[0:38:57] <DraxTD> does this game use NG+ to carry over abilities?
[0:38:59] <prime_name> I still can't believe they gave Dante his own Summon Swords.
[0:39:00] <t0hub0hu> there needs to be an arena mode
[0:39:04] <%Tarcanist_> how many times have you played through son of sparda? @angriestpat
[0:39:05] <%PeaceCentennial> So Balrog is the best fist weapon we can all agree?
[0:39:07] <%lewdskeletor13> @thedr0t He reformed in hell. Does it really matter
[0:39:07] <%drfaustisdead> @AngriestPat Is Gilgamesh the best fist weapon in all of character action? I personally think so.
[0:39:10] <%PeaceCentennial> Fuck Beowulf?
[0:39:12] <%AkronymCLT> @draxtd yes
[0:39:13] <%AncelDeLambert> yeah but only a WEEK early
[0:39:15] <dekkitout> Sto-o-o-p, he's already dead
[0:39:16] <stealthfart> Has Pat beaten the game already?
[0:39:18] <%Tarheelg23> @PeaceCentennial Abso-fucking-lutely
[0:39:21] <%AncelDeLambert> or was it two?
[0:39:21] <TheDr0t> @rytyoung but he's dead and then yonk ima take back yamato
[0:39:23] <+DismalDavid> they are so gooood
[0:39:25] <Them00n> @AngriestPat DMD run when?
[0:39:28] <%TrevyWeaponsGuy> @stealthfart multiple times
[0:39:28] <%starotter70> That's the best answer
[0:39:30] <%DrWolpertinger> there's is, it's called Bloody Palace @t0hub0hu
[0:39:31] <%Birdigalore> A shame this will be V's only game!
[0:39:34] <Archmortal> This game convinced me to like Nero more, finally. His DT in 4 made me want to so bad, but he just didn't have the variety till now
[0:39:35] <+Sp3ctre48> i'm team post-game Nero
[0:39:37] <DraxTD> @AkronymCLT good, I dislike earning the same things over and over ... much rather STYLE!
[0:39:38] <%PeaceCentennial> Nero is on par when he's in NG+
[0:39:38] <+PleasantLee> Nero's DT at the end of this game captioned with the "FUCK YOU!" edged him ahead I think
[0:39:38] <+mcjimbo12> I can't wait for @AngriestPat to get rolled over in mission 19 during the LP while woolie cackles in the background
[0:39:39] <mechslayer71> Nero is really great once you finish the game
[0:39:40] <$D4C_Trice> Balrog IS the best punch and kick weapon
[0:39:41] <%ElenaManetta> dante, v, nero is the correct answer
[0:39:41] <+PleasantLee> I fucking love thsi game
[0:39:46] <%PeaceCentennial> OVERDRIVE YEAH
[0:39:49] <$MightyMaxT> I'd say Nero just because I can grasp him easier. Like, he clicks better for me
[0:39:50] <%Dr_DangerPhD> Both dante and nero are the best they could possibly be
[0:39:50] <+mcjimbo12> post-game nero absolutely fucking nutty
[0:39:50] <%H0rnedG0d> cum
[0:39:51] <%lewdskeletor13> They’re all great
[0:39:51] <%AncelDeLambert> LUL
[0:39:56] <Saturdaythe14th> They could bring back the V moveset as a style or something
[0:39:57] <Prevot> NotLikeThis
[0:39:58] <%NopeBadguy> V doesn't have as much shit
[0:39:58] <$ooblagis> But can Nero SSSS? No, he can not. Therefore he is irrelevent
[0:39:59] <DetroitSentai> V is probably my favorite playstyle in character action, really hope Bayo or the next DMC does something else like it
[0:39:59] <%hntronium> The correct answer is obviously Virgil
[0:39:59] <Saturdaythe14th> It's not like it's impossible
[0:40:00] <%drfaustisdead> I introduced my coworkers to the concept of Feature Bloat.
[0:40:01] <stealthfart> So we didn’t even get to see his reaction to the end game stuff I guess?
[0:40:01] <$HentaiSenpai9K> I didn't like the V reveal cuz it means we can't have him in a sequel
[0:40:02] <$valriot> Dantes my favourite, Neros great but i really like Royal Guard and Trickster to style on bosses
[0:40:02] <DraxTD> Hay @AngriestPat , how old IS Daunte now?
[0:40:03] <pectusumbra> Foolishness Dante. FOOLISHNESS
[0:40:04] <%AkronymCLT> @draxtd u kno it
[0:40:06] <+Mace_Dragon> Classic models for this game like RE2remake would be awsome
[0:40:06] <%SaltyDongs> Woohoo pizza man
[0:40:06] <%mister___doctor> my favorite character is Verote
[0:40:06] <+DismalDavid> yeah buddy
[0:40:08] <mechslayer71> @mcjimbo12 He’s the fucking shit, it’s so good
[0:40:09] <$Sphincter_Spelunker> But Lady and Trish tho
[0:40:10] <Damashi_The_Kaotic> I love them all.
[0:40:12] <Foymic> i can wait
[0:40:12] <%Edgy_Macaroon> Dante. original is always better
[0:40:15] <Tracazoid> Hopefully it has a co-op function.
[0:40:16] <benjiFG> happy birthday paige
[0:40:16] <Nina96> Nero has the thing
[0:40:18] <%Adam_Wayne> Vergil is coming with the bloody palace update
[0:40:20] <+CuteKitkat> Did you see that the achievements for Bloody Palace are already in the game?
[0:40:21] <%AncelDeLambert> big birfday
[0:40:23] <%Adam_Wayne> don't @ me
[0:40:23] <Dingo_Eejit> [COMPLAlNlNG!]
[0:40:23] <$HentaiSenpai9K> April has Game of Thrones and Avengers 4
[0:40:24] <+Tentacruelty_> Thenks Capcpom for my life
[0:40:24] <%lloyddboy> CO OP
[0:40:26] <%PeaceCentennial> @AngriestPat So do you think that this is the best Dante's gameplay moveset has ever been?
[0:40:28] <$valriot> VERGIN
[0:40:28] <LORDSPOOKLEKINS> Nero get's a serious ***'s fucking nuts.
[0:40:28] <%BigNerdSam> Litter for Bloody Palace
[0:40:29] <Manwad> like that one thing
[0:40:30] <GameXful2> @AngriestPat Have you seen the modder who discovered that vergil is playable with a full moveset
[0:40:30] <%TrevyWeaponsGuy> Playable Van
[0:40:30] <%Toynota10> @angriestpat I should've included V. He's pretty awesome in this game. Just thought you'd like these two better
[0:40:31] <@Moobot> Whoa I don't even shout that much! (@PeaceCentennial) (warning)
[0:40:31] <%mister___doctor> Happy Birthday Ssaryn
[0:40:31] <masso101> I wonder if there will be a Vergil downfall dlc in this game
[0:40:31] <bsmusic> Oh shit, I'm away from my computer for all of April...
[0:40:32] <$rytyoung> @thedr0t I'm sure he's alive in the underworld for 1-4 getting "power" then goes for Nero after the events of 4
[0:40:33] <televisedrevolting> Happy Reminder to Not Let It Set In
[0:40:33] <%AkronymCLT> Playable Vergil would be fuckin sick
[0:40:36] <SkyPirateArcane> YEYE
[0:40:36] <$ooblagis> It has lobby data
[0:40:36] <%Alopekis> When is DMC 6 releasing?
[0:40:37] <+mcjimbo12> @mechslayer71 I cannot wait to see Woolie mark out when he realises buster is a thing again
[0:40:38] <+Sp3ctre48> Coop Bloody Palace Kreygasm
[0:40:41] <+Hoovyking1> Vergil has an unfinished playable character ingame
[0:40:41] <Dragon_Batman> Using the same idea behind Bayo 2 maybe?
[0:40:42] <cerberuscarmine> wew
[0:40:43] <%Tarcanist_> do you know how much bloody palace will be or is it free? @angriestpat
[0:40:44] <alrobot2014> how the fuck will we be able to beat dsd royal guard in bloody palace
[0:40:44] <%CerberusDriver> Vergil isn;t confirmed, wish people would stop- running with rumors
[0:40:46] <$GoogleyGareth> It has to
[0:40:48] <%SaltyDongs> Style is temporary, Motivation is eternal
[0:40:50] <Mr_Strut> When Lucia character?
[0:40:50] <%hntronium> Pat and ShmupgodPat duo
[0:40:50] <DemonicCipher> @angriestpat how old will you be in April?
[0:40:51] <+Polter_ge1st> Playable Van?
[0:40:55] <mechslayer71> @akronymclt He got leaked LUL
[0:40:55] <%Adam_Wayne> Vergil is coming with bloody palace
[0:40:57] <@Mechz71> this is not a moveset?
[0:40:58] <%PeaceCentennial> I want playable Lady
[0:40:59] <LORDSPOOKLEKINS> WHEN'S LUCIA THOU
[0:41:00] <%Afterman_> just needs lucifer..
[0:41:03] <%Toynota10> If anyone doesn't say this is his best they are a FOOL
[0:41:03] <$GoogleyGareth> They wouldn't implement a network system for 2 missons
[0:41:05] <devanmuse> @AngriestPat Seeing as how V was the human half of Vergil, does that mean that Vergil has V's mannerisms? Does Vergil go around reading edgy poetry while conducting invisible orchestras when nobody's looking?
[0:41:06] <gunzerkingdunce> People been complaining about no inertia or guard flying
[0:41:06] <pizzanexus> this game's so good
[0:41:07] <$MightyMaxT> I mean, Lady and Trish HAVE to be coming eventually right? The models are there for a reason
[0:41:09] <Bloogoose> I just want Nevan back FeelsBadMan
[0:41:09] <$D4C_Trice> I don't like dmc4 Dante but love dmc5 dante
[0:41:13] <%Agami23> is there any weapon you dislike?
[0:41:13] <%PeaceCentennial> I want Lady with the Cut In stuff they added to Coyote in this game
[0:41:16] <$Sphincter_Spelunker> Needs more Agne and Rudra
[0:41:17] <%Edgy_Macaroon> more crazy tha n you. no way
[0:41:17] <%AkronymCLT> @mechslayer71 excuse me, I need to go clean my pants
[0:41:17] <Saturdaythe14th> @CerberusDriver He's not confirmed but there is a weird debug playable version of him someone found with modding
[0:41:17] <Oqzar> no inertia is huge hit to dante
[0:41:17] <%PeaceCentennial> that stuff is really fun
[0:41:18] <beefomkers> I just want my Virgil please Capcom
[0:41:18] <TheDr0t> @cerberusdriver there is a datamine video of him on reddit
[0:41:21] <%CerberusDriver> There's some form of Inertia in this game
[0:41:23] <$ooblagis> LUL

[0:41:28] <%Toynota10> @devanmuse yup. he's a huge dork
[0:41:29] <%sshen> The network function was either a test for DD2 pawns or for multi BP
[0:41:29] <+Clik404> @mightymaxt Kalina Ann exists already too
[0:41:29] <TranquilTurnip> is this the best DMC game now? is it close or not?
[0:41:30] <Archmortal> baited
[0:41:30] <%hntronium> LUL
[0:41:32] <Dragovus> EXPLOSION!
[0:41:32] <Ziginski> gottem
[0:41:32] <$D4C_Trice> clip it plz
[0:41:33] <$GoogleyGareth> LUL
[0:41:33] <masso101> I don't know, his 2 moveset is pretty good
[0:41:34] <%CerberusDriver> @TheDr0t that doesnt really mean much
[0:41:37] <%Ion_Laser> LUL
[0:41:38] <mechslayer71> @mcjimbo12 I think the other thing is gonna be way bigger for him, since buster already is there as a breaker
[0:41:41] <%alexandrecau> V is Vergil's angst an dUrizen is his edge
[0:41:44] <Make_me_mad> I really hope they put Lady in as playable later. It's pretty much all I need.
[0:41:45] <+mcjimbo12> @TranquilTurnip I don't think it's close, none of the other games do anything better than this game
[0:41:53] <bonzosan> i want a playable re4 leon, dont even change the model
[0:41:53] <%Dr00_PhD> @AngriestPat yo can we litter and send you pics of it for your birthday?
[0:41:56] <%starotter70> @AngriestPat How was Labyrinth?
[0:42:00] <Nina96> LUL LUL LUL
[0:42:02] <+KaiserCrimson_1> I was just playing DMC4SE's Bloody Palace w/ Vergil. Can't wait for thi game's version lol
[0:42:06] <%CerberusDriver> Im not trying to be a pessimist but i feel like a lot of people are gonna be disappointed when BP drops
[0:42:06] <%PeaceCentennial> the good thing about Cavaliere is that you have a lot of time during a hit to switch to Swordmaster
[0:42:07] <TranquilTurnip> @mcjimbo12 yeah this game seems to build on all the good stuff before it so well
[0:42:07] <dukenux> I'd like a V dlc
[0:42:11] <$Sphincter_Spelunker> Lady needs to be in because Dante has no reason to use Coyote A :(
[0:42:11] <+mcjimbo12> @TranquilTurnip 4SE has the advantage of more playable characters and that's basically it
[0:42:11] <%Adam_Wayne> @mcjimbo12 I'd still say DMC 3 has the best bosses
[0:42:12] <+Mace_Dragon> A special edition campaign with the 3 characters being Vergil, Lady, and Trish :D
[0:42:21] <dekkitout> You sure?
[0:42:22] <%Toynota10> @angriestpat Favorite boss? (or is it just Vergil?)
[0:42:24] <dukenux> Pat, what have you done
[0:42:25] <%TrevyWeaponsGuy> But Pat love litter
[0:42:27] <GameXful2> Pat have you seen that Vergil has a full playable moveset
[0:42:27] <DemonicCipher> @angriestpat how old will you be in April Pat?
[0:42:29] <helpmeimafruit> FAKE RELIGION
[0:42:30] <%BigNerdSam> Oh hey someone giftsubbed me, nice. apatDab
[0:42:30] <Make_me_mad> I just hope they don't mess up the bloody palace. I hated 4's version.
[0:42:31] <TranquilTurnip> @mcjimbo12 and there might be more playable characters added later to this I heard
[0:42:32] <%hawk_rush> Just beat the game, my expectations were indeed exceeded
[0:42:32] <noobiemanstreams> Pat PUT THE DAMN FAUST ON THEM BEFORE YOU KILL EM
[0:42:33] <DetroitSentai> NETFLIX DRAGONS DOGMA ANIME @AngriestPat
[0:42:33] <bsmusic> Only Pat can litter
[0:42:33] <Bloogoose> Definitely wasn't weird already.
[0:42:34] <TheDr0t> @cerberusdriver you have to beleib
[0:42:34] <reonome> you asked for this pat
[0:42:36] <%ElenaManetta> Pat doesn't like it when we fetishize his quirks?
[0:42:37] <%Ion_Laser> apatSmug apatOrange apatOrange
[0:42:38] <%lazylynch> what would you think of a lady trish and vergil dlc combo?
[0:42:39] <%hntronium> No territory is too weird for the litter cult
[0:42:39] <DraxTD> @AngriestPat can you put a birthday hat on Skelmo?
[0:42:41] <%Birdigalore> Litter for the Litter Throne!
[0:42:43] <@Moobot> Whoa I don't even shout that much! (@lewdskeletor13) (warning)
[0:42:44] <$HentaiSenpai9K> Why can't people understand jokes
[0:42:47] <RantingRavager> @AngriestPat can we dress up as you and litter?
[0:42:47] <$NocturneNovember> Litter in your own house, keep the outdoors clean
[0:42:48] <%PeaceCentennial> Reminder that Dante actually says that the only person he could think of that can beat Lady and Trish is Vergil
[0:42:48] <%hntronium> FALSE PROPHET
[0:42:52] <Fujiwara_92> sure...
[0:42:54] <$rytyoung> THAT DONT MAKE SENSE THO
[0:42:55] <$D4C_Trice> Considering the double Kalina Ann is Lady even strong enough to use the joined laser attacks?
[0:42:57] <%griffball13> you made a religion about other people littering
[0:42:57] <not_twitter_rowan> God I love you Pat (in a non homo way)
[0:42:57] <%lewdskeletor13> HERETIC
[0:42:57] <%hntronium> ANTI-PATIST
[0:42:58] <%haitchkay> aw man I missed the Griffon fight
[0:42:59] <%SergeEXE> LOCK N LOAD
[0:42:59] <%Dr00_PhD> Yo dragon's dogma anime just announced
[0:42:59] <%mister___doctor> "Littering is wrong if I'm not the one doing it."
[0:43:00] <+mcjimbo12> @Adam_Wayne Yeah I'll allow that, but I think the bosses in this are about equal
[0:43:01] <dekkitout> Ah, no pretenders is what he means
[0:43:03] <abakkus> so we should send you pictures of garbage that you can imagine littering?
[0:43:04] <cerberuscarmine> LOL
[0:43:04] <%haitchkay> did Dante say Flock Off?
[0:43:04] <%Alopekis> What if I litter in the trash cans?
[0:43:05] <%Toynota10> @angriestpat who's favorite boss? (or is it just Vergil)
[0:43:08] <%PeaceCentennial> Lady and Trish are stealth super strong
[0:43:08] <$Sphincter_Spelunker> SourPls
[0:43:08] <dukenux> Jesus(nomen omen), that's some New Testament shit...
[0:43:09] <Bloogoose> Flock off Griffon
[0:43:09] <VritraReiRei> @AngriestPat But then how do we get to Heaven then??? NotLikeThis
[0:43:09] <reonome> @HentaiSenpai9K its not a joke, just the goblins
[0:43:12] <theshillman> @angriestpat can we send you candy wrappers for you to litter with?
[0:43:14] <%hntronium> FALSE MESSIAH OF PATISM is what you are
[0:43:14] <+JayEarly> @dr00_phd whaaaaaaaa
[0:43:16] <cerberuscarmine> and yet pat start religion about litter
[0:43:17] <+PleasantLee> but Griffon in DMC1 could talk, he was just more of a bitch
[0:43:18] <TheDr0t> @angriestpat HATS FOR EVERYONE
[0:43:19] <Mnightshyamallama> Why? he talks in 1
[0:43:20] <%TrevyWeaponsGuy> Why does Griffon have to sound like Gilbert Gottfried
[0:43:22] <$valriot> ...Pat he talked in DMC1
[0:43:22] <%Afterman_> @not_twitter_rowan why not in a homo way
[0:43:23] <%DrWolpertinger> @angriestpat but what about the church of Patism, O Holy One
[0:43:24] <%H0rnedG0d> real impact
[0:43:25] <@Mechz71> why Griffon talked in DMC1 as well
[0:43:25] <%ShaneWhite> Is Paige with you today?
[0:43:25] <%drfaustisdead> OG Griffin could talk.
[0:43:27] <%Edgy_Macaroon> then how does the religion work if you get made at others littering
[0:43:32] <%PalmtopNami> he wants to asend to a captain planet villian and noone else
[0:43:32] <%VioletHeart> Yeah Dragon's Dogma.
[0:43:33] <%hawk_rush> oh, they're already dead
[0:43:33] <%lloyddboy> Shadow's 3-combo reminds me of Blade Wolf's
[0:43:36] <$rytyoung> @vritrareirei He's a false Prophet child
[0:43:43] <%Dr00_PhD> @JayEarly go check wario64s twitter
[0:43:45] <TranquilTurnip> are Dante's lines modulated in Devil Trigger? @AngriestPat
[0:43:46] <%Tarheelg23> @AngriestPat is there any explanation as to why Griffon is super small and why Nightmare isn't goop anymore? Or is it just because video games
[0:43:50] <+Sp3ctre48> I know it would be too much but I wish Shadow and Nightmare talked too
[0:43:51] <+mcjimbo12> @TranquilTurnip yeah
[0:43:53] <$NocturneNovember> He's smaller so he has a lamer voice
[0:43:56] <$ooblagis> He was also 5 times as big
[0:43:56] <Mr_Strut> So if these are Virgil's memories, does that mean that Gryphon was actually just some wise cracking asshole when he wasn't fighting?
[0:43:57] <%TrevyWeaponsGuy> Video gaaaames
[0:43:57] <%Toynota10> I like this silly Griffon
[0:43:58] <%skizzuto> well he was bigger and cooler back then
[0:43:59] <%goose_attack_almanac> He's still baby griffin
[0:43:59] <Megapikman132> he was big then
[0:44:02] <reonome> @Edgy_Macaroon we only worship pat's litter
[0:44:04] <TranquilTurnip> @mcjimbo12 thats a good little detail
[0:44:04] <%PeaceCentennial> hey so when you real impact in DT and the sword spins to keep the enemy locked down
[0:44:04] <RealPT1> this griffin is a good bird
[0:44:05] <Dragon_Batman> I like this Griffon too though
[0:44:07] <Bloogoose> Nelo Angelo's memory is shit, thats why
[0:44:07] <HunterMGlengi> i like how this chapter's sort of a comedy tension release after the soap opera drama
[0:44:07] <Archmortal> Remember, this is Vergil's thoughts here. He clearly mocked the shit out of Griffion
[0:44:10] <+PleasantLee> nightmare is goop
[0:44:12] <CptBritches> @AngriestPat Are you excited to see how they adapt V's playstyle for a summoner character in Dragon's Dogma 2?
[0:44:12] <%Adam_Wayne> Nightmare still is goop
[0:44:12] <%Birdigalore> I mean Nightmare is still goop
[0:44:13] <%AbnormalVoid> gameplay lol
[0:44:15] <%PeaceCentennial> I don't have anything to add, it's just the fucking coolest
[0:44:15] <+Sp3ctre48> Snarky retard Griffon is best Griffon
[0:44:15] <TranquilTurnip> The awnser is this is RAD
[0:44:16] <dekkitout> Shh, issa vidya game
[0:44:16] <$valriot> No hes better now, now hes just fuckin Gilbert Godfrey
[0:44:16] <%Toynota10> @angriestpat who's your favorite boss? (is it just Vergil?)
[0:44:17] <DraxTD> mmmmmmmmmmmmm gooy
[0:44:17] <TheDr0t> @angriestpat put a hat on them
[0:44:19] <HoIlywood_SN> @AngriestPat well nightmare is still goop, he's just man-shaped goop
[0:44:20] <%SergeEXE> because Gameplay
[0:44:20] <filialpails> a wizard did it
[0:44:21] <%Klefth> But Nightmare is goop
[0:44:24] <@Mechz71> nightmare is still goop what are you talking about
[0:44:24] <TyrantBelial> Ok he says it here.
[0:44:24] <Saturdaythe14th> Vergil hit his head really hard in DMC1 and forgot what they were like
[0:44:25] <Mnightshyamallama> I think he has this voice because Vergil probably found him irritating. At least that is my headcanon
[0:44:25] <%drfaustisdead> Nightmare's still goop he's just not a goopy rail gun anymore.
[0:44:26] <%Alopekis> He's goop. He's just goop with a more defined shape.
[0:44:28] <%Nobrev> nightmare is still very much goo
[0:44:28] <+PleasantLee> miss white orbs
[0:44:29] <$ooblagis> It's Souls logic. More Power = Bigger. Except for Sparda and sons
[0:44:29] <%Shadowthedigger> Nightmare is kinda goop; he's just in a big man form now.
[0:44:30] <Nina96> it seems i delayed 20 secs
[0:44:30] <%Ion_Laser> the answer is SHUT UP THO
[0:44:31] <+Exyoh> Nero purged the Nelo outta him, which included these knockoffs
[0:44:33] <Dragovus> so... because shut up
[0:44:36] <dosan121> Nightmare is still goop, playdoh goop that is
[0:44:37] <VRNK> this level really reminds me of half life/half life source
[0:44:41] <mayorrev> Put Faust on the cat
[0:44:43] <%AncelDeLambert> wait what? How does his cane still exist?
[0:44:43] <$Sphincter_Spelunker> @Tarheelg23 Beginning of the stream, Griffon said they were remnants of Nelo Angelo. So fuckin shrug I guess
[0:44:43] <%Shadowthedigger> Like you can still see his texture flowing.
[0:44:44] <Them00n> I'm gonna miss V.
[0:44:45] <%Tarheelg23> alright alright he's still goop I got it guys
[0:44:45] <TyrantBelial> Dante is basically saying he's beating up a bunch of weak orphaned pets.
[0:44:48] <+Sp3ctre48> SourPls
[0:44:48] <$GoogleyGareth> SourPls
[0:44:49] <$rytyoung> Dante getting the cane as a weapon would be dope af
[0:44:49] <sevelodon> SourPls
[0:44:50] <CptBritches> Big boi has arrived
[0:44:50] <%TrevyWeaponsGuy> That's a really cool summoning animation
[0:44:50] <%drfaustisdead> see goop
[0:44:51] <%PeaceCentennial> V was a fun character
[0:44:51] <$ooblagis> Love the music for this fight
[0:44:56] <%PeaceCentennial> that can never actually come back
[0:44:57] <%alexandrecau> vergil likely doesn't have much nightmare of griffin so he is smaller
[0:44:57] <FenixSeraph> Yellow Devil time
[0:44:58] <%Adam_Wayne> "any explanation as to... why nightmare isn't goop anymore"
[0:44:58] <321Continue> is that nightmare? is that true nightmare?
[0:44:58] <bsmusic> THE REMIXES ARE IN POINT
[0:45:00] <%Alopekis> Look at all that gamer goop
[0:45:00] <DraxTD> DAMN that is a good visual effect
[0:45:04] <bsmusic> on point
[0:45:05] <%Adam_Wayne> meanwhile goop
[0:45:07] <Bloogoose> God Sin DT is so fucking boring
[0:45:08] <Dalkalopagus> Woolie completely calling it about V and Urizen was great
[0:45:09] <prime_name> I love Dante's banter with Griffon.
[0:45:11] <person181> look at that damage
[0:45:13] <GameXful2> push the "melt everyone" button AKA sin dt
[0:45:16] <%CerberusDriver> >sin dt is boring
[0:45:16] <%Niney_Who> GIGA DRILL PogChamp
[0:45:19] <%CerberusDriver> what
[0:45:24] <+mcjimbo12> i can't believe dante and nero BOTH get a giga drill
[0:45:24] <+JayEarly> Dat RE2 goo tech
[0:45:25] <%Emperor_Machinus> Is that nightmare?
[0:45:26] <Theomeny> I love Griffin's Iago / Devito-ness.
[0:45:33] <TheDr0t> so cane is not part of vergil?
[0:45:36] <Mnightshyamallama> I feel like sin DT should last a little bit longer
[0:45:37] <%Adam_Wayne> @JayEarly you mean RE7
[0:45:40] <%Edgy_Macaroon> @reonome we don't worship the litter tho
[0:45:40] <+PleasantLee> Pat did you read the Morrison letter that explained how Dante and Trish got to Mallet island, finally setteling a nearly 18 year debate on the matter?
[0:45:41] <$Sphincter_Spelunker> I keep reading iago as Lago
[0:45:49] <vVAstrAVv> nope. its not even a special cane
[0:45:54] <DraxTD> style dropped
[0:45:55] <%alexandrecau> the can e is part of vergil but ti doesn,T want to go back like the summons
[0:46:01] <+Sp3ctre48> Sin DT is short because it trivializes these bosses
[0:46:03] <%TrevyWeaponsGuy> It's just a cool cane
[0:46:08] <prime_name> Don't Real Impact the Kitty
[0:46:09] <TheDr0t> @pleasantlee on a plane?
[0:46:09] <%Toynota10> Does Pat know what you unlock for beating the game on Heaven or Hell mode?
[0:46:12] <%PeaceCentennial> nice weave
[0:46:12] <GameXful2> will the real impact please stand up
[0:46:13] <+mcjimbo12> I think the best animation in the game is V slitting proto angelo's throat with the cane
[0:46:16] <Saturdaythe14th> I'm pretty sure the cane is just a cane. Vergil didn't birth a cane or something
[0:46:20] <%hntronium> No, anti-christs only get fake impacts
[0:46:20] <devanmuse> @PleasantLee There was a debate on that matter? Didn't they just... i dunno, take a boat?
[0:46:25] <+CCCPKi> is this DMD or SoS
[0:46:27] <bsmusic> PogChamp PogChamp PogChamp
[0:46:30] <%SergeEXE> @AngriestPat Does Distortion work in this game? I can't tell from my own testing
[0:46:31] <%Alopekis> RIP Kitty :(
[0:46:33] <+PleasantLee> @TheDr0t a boat
[0:46:33] <%PeaceCentennial> this is devil hunter
[0:46:36] <Bloogoose> This is Devil Hunter.
[0:46:53] <%Dr00_PhD> @CCCPKi finishing up devil hunter
[0:46:56] <+PleasantLee> @devanmuse in the game they literally cut from DMC office to Dante slicing open a gate
[0:47:06] <%CerberusDriver> Nightmare transferred some life to the other demons
[0:47:11] <%drfaustisdead> I'm really surprised there isn't an achievement/trophy for beating this level without disabling any of the recovery pools.
[0:47:12] <DrkJP520> Fist weps and RG against Vergil, let's go
[0:47:13] <GameXful2> cavaliere is the fucknig best

[0:49:37] <+RatedRGibby> FODDER
[0:49:37] <prime_name> Well, Vergil didn't know.
[0:49:38] <shaneok64> FADDER
[0:49:38] <LORDSPOOKLEKINS> WHERE DID HE JUMP TOO
[0:49:38] <Mr_Strut> grandmotherrr
[0:49:40] <%SrG00SE> the Nero is becoming the Vergil
[0:49:40] <dekkitout> Nero is very anime protag-son
[0:49:40] <%korth367> is nero flying right now?
[0:49:40] <%Alopekis> How did they not expect this to happen after withholding that information?
[0:49:42] <reonome> FUHTHER
[0:49:42] <CptBritches> So where did Nero go after he jumped out of the van?
[0:49:43] <TyrantBelial> I love that they assume, Nero wants to KILL Vergil.
[0:49:43] <$HentaiSenpai9K> F... fathur
[0:49:44] <%Dr_DangerPhD> Nero jumps out of van to his own death
[0:49:44] <Fujiwara_92> I HATE MY DADDY

[0:49:47] <dukenux> He knows that he abandoned him and then ripped off his arm
[0:49:47] <%lewdskeletor13> @mr_strut He’s a deadbeat dad who ripped his arm off
[0:49:49] <th3madness> Vergil did walk up and pull his arm off
[0:49:49] <KaptainKappathe5th> FUCK
[0:49:49] <%Adam_Wayne> @thebestestkevin how are you actually supposed to fight the one dudes who turn invisible
[0:49:49] <Dragon_Batman> Awww
[0:49:50] <$ooblagis> Dante was 29 during DMC 1, and the anime takes place like a couple years after that. Patty JUST turned 18, so Dante is like 40 at most
[0:49:50] <cole1114> he does have a grappling hook
[0:49:50] <+Hoovyking1> FADDER
[0:49:50] <Mastigias> ;o;
[0:49:52] <th3madness> so there is that
[0:49:52] <KaptainKappathe5th> BIG F
[0:49:52] <+OldWorldFool> Gets in the van just to jump out
[0:49:52] <TyrantBelial> As if that's the only possible way of thinking here.
[0:49:53] <%skizzuto> I like how they frame that shot so it looks like the car is going up even though it's going downhill
[0:49:53] <dukenux> I HATE MY DADDY

[0:49:54] <cole1114> he could be doing some spider-man shit
[0:49:55] <Dragovus> Devil May Cry anime is free on PSN but you need to get it from a system not the website
[0:49:56] <$Sphincter_Spelunker> Daddy Issue May Cry

[0:50:02] <xtremegamer80> Oh that hurt
[0:50:02] <%alexandrecau> like Dante at least have some good memories of vergil if anything it's harder on him than Nero
[0:50:03] <EL3GYFighter> Oof that picture went into the wound again
[0:50:03] <Bloogoose> I CAME WHEN I SAW VERGIL
[0:50:03] <%AkronymCLT> I want Nero to have a long sit down with Vergil and try to explain that he's just as stupid as Dante

[0:50:06] <%Dr00_PhD> IT'S TIME
[0:50:06] <FenixSeraph> Lady always felt bad about killing akrham
[0:50:07] <CappuccinoGuil> So, I think those guys are the actual manifestation of Vergil's past trauma as Nelo Angelo. Just a hunch

[0:50:24] <%BigNerdSam> Nero jumped on a helicopter
[0:50:25] <$NocturneNovember> Whoever keeps saying Luke killed Vader is dumb. Palpatine's lightning fucked up Vader's life support.

[1:05:23] <Saturdaythe14th> He missed the doppelganger buster too
[1:05:23] <Futurecity10> @AngriestPat You can buster virgil out of the air btw
[1:05:25] <+HeadsHeldHigh> Pat automatically loses when he doesnt buster the charge
[1:05:25] <%sshen> this is pats 4th playthrough
[1:05:26] <Buttku> that devil trigger remix tho
[1:05:27] <%Niney_Who> I'm so glad I wasn't spoiled on this

[1:05:31] <%alexandrecau> @JayEarly yes he stops vergil dead on track
[1:05:32] <+Sp3ctre48> This is meant to be a victory lap more than anything

[1:05:48] <%SrG00SE> pull THE SNUGGLE TRIGGER
[1:05:49] <$rytyoung> @cafefunk maybe 3-10 by this point
[1:05:49] <dero45> Yeah pat and Woolie best this awhile ago I think
[1:05:55] <mechslayer71> @sp3ctre48 Yeah, you get infinite DT the first time LUL
[1:05:56] <dero45> Beat
[1:05:59] <$HentaiSenpai9K> Not Woolie
[1:05:59] <%CerberusDriver> @dero45 woolie hasnt
[1:06:00] <$cureneckbeard> Did Pat unlock the 3,000,000 emote yet
[1:06:01] <%sshen> Woolie hasn't beat it yet
[1:06:01] <gunzerkingdunce> This fight just shows how BUSTED Buster is
[1:06:02] <+PleasantLee> DT again!
[1:06:03] <Saturdaythe14th> I'm pretty sure Woolie is nowhere near done
[1:06:09] <%Toynota10> you can do a dual hold buster throw and I love it
[1:06:10] <%goose_attack_almanac> @dero45 Nope. Woolie still hasn't. He's staying clean for the LP
[1:06:10] <%heyitsbrian> I kind of wish that V was able to fight Virgil, but I don't know how it would have happened
[1:06:11] <+Clik404> @palmtopnami not wanting your father or uncle to murder each other?
[1:06:12] <eiightbiitt> I used 2 glorbs to beat him as Dante
[1:06:15] <%lewdskeletor13> @dero45 Pat beat it before the LP
[1:06:17] <Mr_216> FUCK YOU Power YAHOO
[1:06:18] <$rytyoung> @saturdaythe14th he must be kicking himself
[1:06:20] <indig0bird> PLEASE no one tell Woolie
[1:06:21] <%sshen> The LP is as far as he has gotten
[1:06:22] <+JayEarly> This is the most “the first play through is a tutorial” this series has ever been
[1:06:22] <%Shadowthedigger> Wait didn't he grow a hand back? Why does he need the Devil Breakers still?
[1:06:27] <%PalmtopNami> he literally killed millions Nero
[1:06:28] <%tyler274> battle in V's mind
[1:06:31] <+mcjimbo12> @heyitsbrian Eh they could have a fight in the mind-dimension or something but that's it
[1:06:33] <Saturdaythe14th> Damn, you missed both special busters
[1:06:33] <SailingSaturn> Did anyone else read about Sparda's other swords? cirISee
[1:06:34] <nobodybutalex> You can grab them both in DT
[1:06:35] <Saturdaythe14th> but still cool
[1:06:37] <%Afterman_> if you grab both of them while DT'd you smash their faces together
[1:06:37] <%ArcanumMBD> @AngriestPat there's a unique grab if you grab DT vergil while you're in DT
[1:06:37] <%Niney_Who> YEAAHHH
[1:06:39] <$ooblagis> You didn't get the charge Buster, you might as well restart
[1:06:39] <silvcrest> Booooo

[1:06:41] <FenixSeraph> NICE
[1:06:42] <%SergeEXE> No Buster Catch = FAILED
[1:06:42] <dero45> Woolie staying pure bless him
[1:06:42] <+mcjimbo12> @AngriestPat There's a unique animation if you grab doppelganger in DT
[1:06:42] <$Sphincter_Spelunker> I'm not digging Nero's DT. It's a mess. Damn :(
[1:06:42] <%Toynota10> @angriestpat have you grabbed them both together?
[1:06:43] <Make_me_mad> If you devil trigger before you grab the ghost he slams them together.
[1:06:43] <Phassums> YEET THAT DAD

[1:07:55] <Oqzar> the entire city?
[1:07:55] <%Dr00_PhD> SO MANY
[1:07:56] <DatAsuna> Thousands of randos
[1:07:56] <+Dovakhin573> his demon self kinda did
[1:07:57] <%Alopekis> Kiryu never killed anyone
[1:07:58] <rjj25> urizen
[1:07:58] <%Josef_Stryker> Definitely Arkham at least
[1:07:59] <MrHappyFunshine> Only DMC3 did
[1:07:59] <NivekMD> alot of humans
[1:07:59] <+mcjimbo12> The Qlipoth was growing anyway
[1:07:59] <beefomkers> Yes
[1:07:59] <42nfl19> @AngriestPat Vergil is so tsundere...
[1:08:00] <dero45> Vergil did nothing wrong
[1:08:00] <Ninjagregory98> He destroyed two cities
[1:08:00] <+RogueCrocodile> Nell Goldstein
[1:08:00] <$rytyoung> NO ITS STILL VERGIL
[1:08:01] <%Agami23> thousands of innocents in 3
[1:08:01] <+Sp3ctre48> Urizen killed lots of people though
[1:08:01] <%PalmtopNami> no.
[1:08:02] <%lewdskeletor13> URIZEN DID
[1:08:02] <Imbetweenjobs_> same coin
[1:08:02] <Mnightshyamallama> as Urizen yes. a ton of people
[1:08:02] <+Bajihri2> DMC3 he did, technically no in 5
[1:08:03] <%sshen> 2 sides of the same coin Pat
[1:08:03] <rosabellamelantha> HE KILLED MILLIONS
[1:08:03] <CptBritches> He is responsible for creating Urizen
[1:08:03] <DarthRevan0609> No, Urizen is not Vergil, he's a separate entity
[1:08:04] <dekkitout> Don't give me that bs
[1:08:04] <+PleasantLee> Urizen has no memories of being a "human"
[1:08:04] <Mr_216> No both are Vergil
[1:08:05] <%Halowood> Then no
[1:08:05] <RiderUmbra> yes but he is responsible
[1:08:05] <%nmaten> theyre both vergil tho
[1:08:06] <%skizzuto> He's super responsible for it tho, he created them
[1:08:06] <th3madness> vergil literally chose to unleash it
[1:08:06] <+combustable1> as urizen alot....
[1:08:06] <%Ion_Laser> He killed a lot of humans
[1:08:07] <%Lithdoran> Howw???
[1:08:07] <+chaumiester> Arkham
[1:08:07] <%Adam_Wayne> all the people of Red Grave aren't really people so it's fine
[1:08:07] <+HeadsHeldHigh> This is Orochimaru all over again
[1:08:08] <%Rngiddion> i mean all the people on 3
[1:08:08] <DatAsuna> YOU ARE WRONG PAT
[1:08:08] <DonatelloJose> BROTHER PUNCH
[1:08:08] <Nazgul240> ditto what someone said, Vergil is Vegeta
[1:08:08] <%TenderBabyBacon> But Vergil is Uruzen as well
[1:08:08] <%DirtyGaijin> He may have not done it himself but through his actions Urizen was born
[1:08:09] <$HentaiSenpai9K> They're both part of Vergil Pat
[1:08:09] <Stillchr> Vergil is tsundere
[1:08:09] <Bakefowl> Indirectly
[1:08:09] <MyDarkStorm> Pat The Answer Is YES
[1:08:10] <The_Butterfly_Man> Kinda????
[1:08:10] <%PalmtopNami> he did this. this is what he wanted.
[1:08:10] <dragoon001914> The Qlipthoth tree just naturally happens, Vergil had nothing to do with it.
[1:08:11] <Videogamer4> BibleThump
[1:08:12] <$D4C_Trice> Vergil killed tons of people as urizen
[1:08:12] <arran_throttle> he pulled Vagita
[1:08:12] <krksobk> pass that mantle
[1:08:13] <+GentlemenWalrus> But Vergil is both
[1:08:13] <dukenux> Capisce, eh?
[1:08:13] <%lewdskeletor13> They are different people
[1:08:13] <%ElenaManetta> K I S S
[1:08:13] <SailingSaturn> still his responsibluty tho
[1:08:13] <%BigNerdSam> Vergil killed Ryu's sensei
[1:08:13] <%Tarheelg23> But he chose to become Urizen @AngriestPat
[1:08:13] <%kewlmyc> Urizen stemmed from him, it's his problem
[1:08:14] <%luckevalentine> He's destroyed multiple cities
[1:08:15] <bbomi1995> millions of redgrave citizens dont count?
[1:08:15] <RiderUmbra> and urizine is more Vergil than v
[1:08:16] <dekkitout> "It wasn't Anakin, it was Vader"
[1:08:16] <%drfaustisdead> @AngriestPat Virgil caused not one but two demonic genocides and he gets a pass.
[1:08:16] <%Albadabar> Urizen was born of Vergils' lust for power. Any innocents claimed by him are 100% his fault
[1:08:17] <%DirtyGaijin> so responsible at least
[1:08:17] <helpmeimafruit> @AngriestPat this is the second Tower of Power Vergil was responsible for, probably killed thousands
[1:08:17] <%Josef_Stryker> No wait that was Lady
[1:08:17] <CptBritches> His actions directly created Urizen
[1:08:17] <th3madness> DOUBLE BACKHAND
[1:08:18] <+tigerfang86> DOUBLE PUNCH
[1:08:18] <+KaiserCrimson_1> He MAY have killed Nell and a bunch of those townspeople
[1:08:18] <beefomkers> Virgil is a fucking sociopath who should be killed
[1:08:18] <Omgthatwasreal> reverse Fusion Technique
[1:08:18] <%goose_attack_almanac> He cut off his sons arm and caused everything
[1:08:18] <person181> lady did that
[1:08:18] <+Bloodxb> they have his traits and his wants but they arent vergil
[1:08:18] <%Josef_Stryker> LUL
[1:08:20] <JackMcStone> Erecting the tower probably fucked with some people
[1:08:20] <VorpalSlash> Temen-Ni-Gru wrecked that city
[1:08:20] <Dragon_Batman> LUL
[1:08:20] <mechslayer71> PASS THE TORCH BABY
[1:08:21] <$valriot> Urizen did, but technically its Vergils fault
[1:08:21] <$ooblagis> He helped Arkham make the giant demon tower show up to kill everyone
[1:08:21] <aeonicvector> Babies with a sniper
[1:08:21] <%Niney_Who> OOO
[1:08:22] <reonome> LUL
[1:08:22] <%PalmtopNami> pat.
[1:08:23] <Imbetweenjobs_> killed beowulf
[1:08:23] <CappuccinoGuil> Arkham was killed, though
[1:08:23] <dukenux> LUL
[1:08:23] <+HeadsHeldHigh> It's ALL OVER THE WORLD
[1:08:23] <+abrokemusician> yeah but I think Vergil was planning for Urizen to do the thing he did ultimately
[1:08:25] <%TenderBabyBacon> Gottem
[1:08:25] <42nfl19> bitch slap!
[1:08:25] <%Ion_Laser> LUL
[1:08:26] <KaptainKappathe5th> SMACKED
[1:08:26] <%Toynota10> @angriestpat Think they'll end the series on a DMC6?
[1:08:26] <Mr_Strut> It was a team effort
[1:08:27] <%ElenaManetta> odfffesbfsdgh
[1:08:27] <+daisyyyy> Vergil and V are still responsible
[1:08:27] <%Adam_Wayne> he and Dante both killed Arkham what are you talking about @AngriestPat
[1:08:28] <%nitronLVIII> JACKPOT kiiled Arkham
[1:08:28] <%TrevyWeaponsGuy> LUL
[1:08:29] <$ooblagis> D E A D W E I G H T
[1:08:29] <Eger007> domestic abuse
[1:08:30] <+HeadsHeldHigh> Not just in this city
[1:08:30] <th3madness> about that powerup....
[1:08:31] <%H0rnedG0d> Vergil did nothing wrong
[1:08:31] <Them00n> Summoning the Tower in 3 must have killed somebody. @AngriestPat
[1:08:31] <%SrG00SE> imagine fighting both
[1:08:32] <HoIlywood_SN> @AngriestPat he's tangentially responsible for people dying in that city from DMC3
[1:08:32] <SnaKemuho> do you kill a person you kill in a blind rage where you don't remember yourself?
[1:08:33] <UnderpaidBob> jackpot
[1:08:33] <Khorneflakes_> LUL awesome
[1:08:33] <CappuccinoGuil> Wait, Lady killed Arkham, tho
[1:08:36] <%ginger__gaming__> Him not ending this initially probably killed people from the plants spreading
[1:08:36] <arran_throttle> Vergil is basicly Vagita after this
[1:08:36] <Oqzar> urizen is still half vergil so he killed half of all those people
[1:08:37] <%Dr00_PhD> He pressed the kill button pat
[1:08:37] <%Afterman_> vergil the abortion dr
[1:08:37] <+stagemage> the hulk never really killed anyone right
[1:08:38] <DatAsuna> jackpot didn't kill him
[1:08:38] <TranquilTurnip> I think Vergil WOULD kill
[1:08:39] <Khorneflakes_> There they go running away the responsibility of Nero being a part of thier family.
[1:08:40] <+Malogor> But Vergil has the memories of V, he did thank him earlier
[1:08:41] <SoaringLettuce> raising the temen ni gru killed thousands of people
[1:08:42] <+mysterypork> D E A D W E I G H T
[1:08:42] <Limes528> Virgil's new design is awesome
[1:08:42] <$XeroSigmaPrime> Virgil is a sociopath, but Vergil isnt
[1:08:43] <CptBritches> He created Urizen. He is responsible for his actions
[1:08:44] <vergil_angelo> @angriestpat He killed Beowulf
[1:08:44] <%Adam_Wayne> @AngriestPat also all of Red Grave are directly a result of his actions
[1:08:44] <%ShaneWhite> Niro rejected
[1:08:45] <%nitronLVIII> nvm lady killed artkham
[1:08:45] <+chaumiester> What about in DMC3 where in summoned a bunch of demons in a city?
[1:08:47] <%skizzuto> not if it keeps making money
[1:08:49] <%Rngiddion> the real talk answer from the series is "Who Cares He's Cool"
[1:08:49] <Mr_216> DMC N
[1:08:49] <$rytyoung> naaah DMC 12
[1:08:49] <oldmemesdiehard> Lady killed Arkham chat what are you on
[1:08:50] <Dragovus> The Devil Sword Dante is a Monster Hunter weapon
[1:08:51] <Suwaiya> aight imma go get some cigarette be right back nero
[1:08:51] <%PalmtopNami> His intentions were to do anything for power.
[1:08:51] <%SrG00SE> i like that he still likes it
[1:08:53] <%SrG00SE> kinda
[1:08:54] <%DirtyGaijin> I think Nero will take the lead
[1:08:54] <+mysterypork> NEEEEEEEEERD
[1:08:55] <%lewdskeletor13> Hell nah
[1:08:57] <+Mace_Dragon> I miss Vergil's beowulf moveset
[1:08:57] <FatDragonQuest> Vergil killed Arkham, technically Nero's mom, his landlord
[1:08:58] <%PalmtopNami> hes a piece of shit.
[1:08:58] <reonome> haha vergil's a nerd
[1:08:58] <indig0bird> How very Virgil of him
[1:08:58] <arran_throttle> bye Vagita
[1:08:59] <VorpalSlash> "Here's your child support."
[1:08:59] <dekkitout> Here's your kinda uncle's edgy fanfics
[1:08:59] <Megapikman132> Virgil closet goth?
[1:09:01] <%Josef_Stryker> BYE SOOOON
[1:09:01] <gunzerkingdunce> Here's the thing, they can leave WHENEVER, he still has Yamato
[1:09:02] <dero45> If anything Vergil’s demon side killed people or is atleast responsible for their death
[1:09:02] <Imbetweenjobs_> think we;ll get a special edition to play as virgil?
[1:09:03] <+mcjimbo12> @Toynota10 I think this is the end of dante and vergil's story. DMC6 might be Nero vs Mundus or Sparda with dante/vergil tagging in near the end
[1:09:03] <+DismalDavid> dmc 6 has to happen now with the sales
[1:09:04] <%Mikatonic> bye daddy
[1:09:04] <%sshen> This dramatic ending where they go to hell and can't get back sort of goes to shit when they take in the yamato which OPENS PORTALS
[1:09:04] <+DeRedBaron> @AngriestPat i've been thinking about it and like someone said they were sad that they guess V was evil or something, but im like was evil actulaly him or vergil?
[1:09:06] <%BigNerdSam> Vergil confirmed HUGE NERD
[1:09:07] <+tigerfang86> the demuns
[1:09:07] <hotrax> Urizan is basically Ergil
[1:09:08] <+atomic_lobster> hey look Vergil might as well be Vegeta now
[1:09:08] <%TrevyWeaponsGuy> Take my copy of "The Marriage of Heaven and Hell"
[1:09:10] <DarkSideCow> he let alot of people die
[1:09:10] <Megapikman132> I'd agree
[1:09:11] <MyDarkStorm> No it was Vergil
[1:09:12] <%Birdigalore> So when did Vergil get Sin Devil Trigger lol
[1:09:13] <T_Sasquatch> WHO CARES about the humans LUL
[1:09:14] <$ooblagis> I think so too
[1:09:15] <%drfaustisdead> FAAAATHER! UNCLLLLE!
[1:09:16] <+HeadsHeldHigh> Vergil does not give a shit either way
[1:09:17] <%TenderBabyBacon> But Urizen is still Vergil
[1:09:17] <%WackyGear> same thing pat
[1:09:18] <helpmeimafruit> vergil did NOTHING WRONG
[1:09:19] <+punit216> still millions are dead
[1:09:19] <%Adam_Wayne> @AngriestPat it's still half of him doing it
[1:09:19] <TakesGuts> i agree
[1:09:19] <$rytyoung> For sure
[1:09:19] <th3madness> when vergil ate the fruit
[1:09:21] <+Sp3ctre48> I think Vergil was just trying to save himself
[1:09:22] <DarkSideCow> but he dident do the work him self
[1:09:23] <%Afterman_> he gets SDT after the fruit
[1:09:23] <th3madness> or urizen did
[1:09:23] <Megapikman132> And V says he never intended for that stuff to happen
[1:09:24] <%hawk_rush> yeah, that makes sense
[1:09:25] <jubejube56> @Birdigalore probably after eating the apple
[1:09:26] <+rowegd> So DMV 6: Sparta returns?
[1:09:26] <+PleasantLee> WHENS MUNDUS!
[1:09:27] <TranquilTurnip> Vergil did nothing wrong LUL
[1:09:27] <$HentaiSenpai9K> Urizen IS Vergil Pat. He remembered Dante
[1:09:29] <Stillchr> Vergil is a tsun tsun
[1:09:29] <+Bloodxb> also v did try to stop it
[1:09:30] <$rytyoung> best scene in the game
[1:09:31] <beefomkers> That is still Vergil tho
[1:09:33] <Make_me_mad> He still made Urizen entirely because he wanted to be stronger, and thought Urizen would BE stronger by being pure evil.
[1:09:33] <benjiFG> yummy apple
[1:09:33] <abakkus> i still dont get the deal w nero's arm/not arm situation
[1:09:33] <%CerberusDriver> @AngriestPat Vergil wanted to save himself from dying basically, dont blame the guy for trying it with yamato
[1:09:34] <CptBritches> Yeah, but he is still responsible for what happened. He should've known that his pure demon form would hurt innocents
[1:09:34] <Ninjagregory98> What was Virgil’s plan then?
[1:09:34] <$Sphincter_Spelunker> So V is just this game's Gloria? RIP that character
[1:09:35] <silverback129> Urizen is Virgils power lust at its absolute worst
[1:09:35] <bbomi1995> fair enough
[1:09:36] <+chaumiester> ....... Nero's Mother Puss.... He slayed the hell outta that
[1:09:36] <$rytyoung> here we gooo
[1:09:37] <Khorneflakes_> Yeah Virigil probably doesn't care
[1:09:37] <Limes528> But Urizen was created because Virgil was a dickhead
[1:09:37] <T_Sasquatch> This game brushes over how many peoples lives were ruined and the destructiion that occured LUL
[1:09:38] <+daisyyyy> I do think his time as V softened him up again
[1:09:38] <42nfl19> I think it depends? Did he start the qliphoth or just capitalize it when it sprung up? @AngriestPat
[1:09:40] <th3madness> best bantz
[1:09:40] <Eger007> urizen didn't have vergil's memories
[1:09:41] <%Lithdoran> Urizen IS Vergil. He's as much Vergil's demon half as much as V is his human half.
[1:09:41] <dfs_k> he did kill a hellava lot of people when he summoned teminigru though, off screen
[1:09:42] <indig0bird> If I steal a car, and lots of people die as a result of me escaping the poice, I'm still guilty as fuck even though I didn't meant anyone to die
[1:09:42] <dukenux> Vergil is all a bout End justifies the measn, anyway
[1:09:43] <%Alopekis> That's why you don't eat apples that are past their expiration date.
[1:09:44] <didgereedoodah> this is my favourite scene
[1:09:44] <+DeRedBaron> i think Urazin was legit the most extreme part of his search for power to the point where his humanity wouldn't restrain him
[1:09:45] <%AkronymCLT> Virgil's only thought seemed to be "have to beat Dante"
[1:09:47] <xtremegamer80> Repitles
[1:09:48] <SoaringLettuce> raising the temen ni gru killed thousands of people PAAAAT
[1:09:49] <%Mikatonic> that's what it says in the library
[1:09:50] <%Toynota10> I hope he's a lot more challenging in DMD mode
[1:09:52] <%Alopekis> She has a point
[1:09:53] <reonome> nico pls
[1:09:55] <$rytyoung> Nico for best supporting character
[1:09:55] <irfan_> urizen is a heartless and V a nobody
[1:09:57] <%Alopekis> He has a point too
[1:09:57] <%Albadabar> @AngriestPat Urizen being born was a direct result of Vergil's lust for power. Any innocents killed by him tie directly back to that descision so it is his fault
[1:09:58] <dukenux> No more robot arms? BibleThump
[1:09:58] <RantingRavager> He's reading the book <3
[1:09:59] <%SaltyDongs> You weird lizard freak
[1:09:59] <dero45> Urizen was just 100% demon Vergil still him
[1:10:01] <LORDSPOOKLEKINS> AKA don't worry about it LUL
[1:10:01] <%lewdskeletor13> Vergil’s book of poetry
[1:10:02] <%Adam_Wayne> @AkronymCLT that was also Urizen's thoughts as well
[1:10:05] <@Moobot> Whoa I don't even shout that much! (@krksobk) (warning)
[1:10:05] <SailingSaturn> @Ninjagregory98 heal himself and defeat dante cirTan
[1:10:06] <%SrG00SE> omg i just realized. Kyrie is never cumming again
[1:10:06] <+Sp3ctre48> This man is literally a demon
[1:10:08] <Imbetweenjobs_> so neros normal devil trigger is stronger than their sin devil trigger?
[1:10:13] <%CerberusDriver> Vergil is DMC's Vegeta basically People forget Vegeta blew up a planet once.
[1:10:13] <Theomeny> He's just pouring over that book, isn't Nero.
[1:10:14] <%DirtyGaijin> maybe he will get Gauntlets instead
[1:10:14] <+KaiserCrimson_1> Aww he's reading the book ^_^
[1:10:15] <+Grey_Frog> Vergil's DT file references his SIn DT being a result of him eating the apple.
[1:10:15] <benjiFG> I bet Vergil hates smoking
[1:10:17] <$rytyoung> LOL JK
[1:10:19] <dekkitout> Rip sweet surrender
[1:10:20] <+daisyyyy> Can Dante regenerate limbs?
[1:10:20] <%starotter70> Or creepy scale arm
[1:10:20] <Zedimonx5> All Urizens are Vergil but not all Vergils are Urizen
[1:10:22] <abakkus> except in that last fight where he still had robot arms
[1:10:23] <%Alopekis> What about demon arms?
[1:10:23] <%AncelDeLambert> no more DEVIL arm
[1:10:24] <$HentaiSenpai9K> Robo Gauntlets now
[1:10:25] <Megapikman132> yeah, reading the V Book
[1:10:25] <+HeadsHeldHigh> Crybaby Nero
[1:10:25] <DetroitSentai> Love is STRONG
[1:10:26] <$D4C_Trice> @irfan_ I am shaking my head at you because it's true
[1:10:26] <T_Sasquatch> Rip busterarm
[1:10:27] <th3madness> BOOKENDS
[1:10:27] <Jetostream> @AngriestPat Dont you think that the ending feels a little rushed? It builds up so much, but the payoff was kinda not that huge.
[1:10:28] <%Niney_Who> LUL
[1:10:28] <+Sp3ctre48> Sure LUL
[1:10:28] <dadeaner> the phantom pain
[1:10:28] <CappuccinoGuil> No more robot arms? Kyrie must be DEVASTATED
[1:10:28] <%PeaceCentennial> I can't believe they just removed an entire gameplay mechanic
[1:10:29] <NotHereToStream> finally, flesh hand i can use to jerk off with
[1:10:30] <arcaderabbit48> No more Sweet Surrender! Poor Kyrie!
[1:10:30] <thecrabgodrulerofcrabs> Urixen is his demonic lust for power without humanity to limit it at all, so Urizen did some things Vergil wouldn't
[1:10:30] <SnaKemuho> @imbetweenjobs_ nah, they were just already tired from fighting each other
[1:10:31] <Mr_Strut> So is the robot part still INSIDE his arm?
[1:10:31] <DarkSideCow> sayen power progression
[1:10:32] <%H0rnedG0d> SWEETER SURRENDER
[1:10:32] <%AncelDeLambert> his arm is human, fucking wierd
[1:10:33] <DetroitSentai> Love
[1:10:33] <FenixSeraph> Dante kills every dad
[1:10:33] <dukenux> but only ONCE
[1:10:34] <reonome> vergil ain't even dead
[1:10:35] <+Bloodxb> instead nero can devil trigger in bed
[1:10:35] <masso101> You better do the credits fight good pat
[1:10:36] <%rdark_ksu> he killed him, but he got better
[1:10:36] <%hntronium> HE GOT BETTER THO
[1:10:37] <benjiFG> he's motivated
[1:10:38] <sevelodon> they were tired
[1:10:38] <Mr_216> cuz shutup
[1:10:40] <CptBritches> Vergil unleashed his pure demon form. If he didn't expect that to end up hurting people then he's an idiot, and he's still responsible even if he didn't plan it
[1:10:40] <+atomic_lobster> that's the power of love
[1:10:41] <%Alopekis> Plot reasons
[1:10:42] <%SaltyDongs> shut up
[1:10:42] <DarkSideCow> demons are sayens
[1:10:42] <DetroitSentai> @AngriestPat Love
[1:10:42] <%AbnormalVoid> LUL
[1:10:44] <42nfl19> I think it depends? Did he start the qliphoth or just capitalize it when it sprung up? @AngriestPat
[1:10:44] <%Toynota10> because he's half human

[1:10:45] <%hntronium> Little Bitch
[1:10:46] <SkyPirateArcane> He's more human
[1:10:46] <+PleasantLee> Nero is more human thus has more human spirit
[1:10:46] <%griffball13> the more human the more power
[1:10:47] <%nitronLVIII> HUMANS ARE STRONGER
[1:10:47] <buffmurffy> because anime
[1:10:47] <%BigNerdSam> Vergil has more DT cells
[1:10:47] <T_Sasquatch> its not really, vergil and dante were tired as fuck
[1:10:47] <Saturdaythe14th> He's got more human blood
[1:10:48] <%TenderBabyBacon> THe Power of Love
[1:10:48] <benjiFG> because da heart

[1:10:48] <VritraReiRei> @AngriestPat yet in that Title Screen he still has a robot arm Kappa
[1:10:50] <%Josef_Stryker> D-Cells?
[1:10:50] <helpmeimafruit> @AngriestPat but Gohan is weak as fuck now
[1:10:51] <mechslayer71> They were tired
[1:10:51] <%Afterman_> alternatively its NOT. they were just exhausted
[1:10:51] <%Starlight_Gamer> sure why not Pat
[1:10:52] <+chaumiester> @AngriestPat Vergil killed the hell outta Nero's Mother's..... Vag. That's what he killed
[1:10:52] <SnaKemuho> They were just tired
[1:10:53] <$XeroSigmaPrime> It's like Saiyan logic, half blood Saiyans are WAYYY stronger
[1:10:53] <%lloyddboy> HE HAS A WIFE
[1:10:54] <blackbookalpha> WHAT DID VERGIL FUCK?
[1:10:54] <Megapikman132> because THEMES
[1:10:55] <%drfaustisdead> because Heart @AngriestPat because Heart.
[1:10:56] <%starotter70> S cells
[1:10:56] <$ooblagis> Dante and Vergil had been fighting, Jester beat them once before too, he isn't stronger than them
[1:10:57] <DonatelloJose> The power of Self Respect
[1:10:57] <Jslicerx> It seems like Nero has always been an inch away from more powerful
[1:10:58] <+Bad1uck> Just 25% demon
[1:10:59] <%connos_livereview> S Cells
[1:10:59] <th3madness> except then they both bitchslapped him
[1:10:59] <beefomkers> He's got more human
[1:11:00] <dukenux> Nico, i'm already a demon!

[1:11:00] <+rbakervv> hrybrid vigor
[1:11:00] <%MagickBurritoh> he's only a quater demon
[1:11:01] <Jetostream> @AngriestPat Dont you think that the ending feels a little rushed? It builds up so much, but the payoff was kinda not that huge.
[1:11:01] <bonzosan> Dante cells
[1:11:01] <Mr_216> cuz Nero has PLOT POWER
[1:11:01] <%Alopekis> Where's Kyrie?
[1:11:02] <SoaringLettuce> human potential is greater
[1:11:02] <not_twitter_rowan> Also Nero and Dante has just kicked the shit out each other
[1:11:02] <%DirtyGaijin> vergil is gohan
[1:11:02] <indig0bird> The power of being a nice boyfriend?
[1:11:03] <Theomeny> Nero's Aggressive Wholesomeness is literally a weapon in this universe.
[1:11:03] <TakesGuts> they were tired as fuck
[1:11:04] <silvcrest> Dante and Vergil just got through with a drag out fight. Vergil was tired
[1:11:04] <%Niney_Who> It's because Nero isn't a heathen that Fucks and Leaves.
[1:11:05] <+Chronobot> Awoke to Family family family
[1:11:05] <Saturdaythe14th> Nero with a robot arm was stronger than Dante with regular DT already
[1:11:05] <+Xertagon1> devils can cry :)
[1:11:07] <Imbetweenjobs_> makes sense
[1:11:08] <%rdark_ksu> nero you are like a quadroon or something
[1:11:08] <%BigNerdSam> NERO I mean nero has more DT Cells
[1:11:10] <%Dr_DangerPhD> Nero has Angel Trigger lol
[1:11:10] <+Sp3ctre48> Nero with the breakers was already Dante tier, DT just made him strong enough to beat a weakened Vergil
[1:11:10] <%px120> That's a tuslly kinda true
[1:11:11] <%Klefth> Nico's the best, lol
[1:11:11] <%H0rnedG0d> V has come to

[1:11:16] <SailingSaturn> @AlopekisPup chilling with the orphans cirTan
[1:11:17] <%VioletHeart> @AngriestPat I mean they do talk about how human blood is what demons feed on and makes them stronger. Maybe having a bit of human in you is actually a power-up?
[1:11:17] <Mnightshyamallama> also it is fair to assume that Vergil was a little tired after fighting with Dante
[1:11:18] <blackdragonz> so would a 1/16 demon basically be a god

[1:11:38] <%PeaceCentennial> @AngriestPat So the theory I saw is that Demons feast on Human blood, but when you're both Human and Demon, you have a bunch of innate power

[1:12:15] <MrHappyFunshine> @AngriestPat My logic is that he has two devil bringers now considering those things subdue and absorb devil energy would make it easier to handle them.

[1:13:19] <$MightyMaxT> Shut up its ANIME
[1:13:19] <%Alopekis> That's awesome :D
[1:13:21] <mayorrev> so there's gonna be story DLC yeah?
[1:13:22] <jubejube56> dual snatch
[1:13:24] <beefomkers> Nero is a stand
[1:13:26] <Dragon_Batman> Gives em an excuse to keep using it so who cares
[1:13:26] <%Kravedarknesss> Playing over the credits is so cool
[1:13:26] <%SergeEXE> DUAL HOLD
[1:13:27] <vVAstrAVv> phased out
[1:13:28] <redial_nick> bayo credits
[1:13:28] <KaptainKappathe5th> so what actually happened to virgil and dante?
[1:13:30] <%Alopekis> This is the most anime game ever made :D
[1:13:31] <mak0t0yukii> YEYEYEYEYEYE
[1:13:31] <dekkitout> His moveset as the credits in prime
[1:13:32] <%Klefth> Yeah, you can see it for a second. His arm just phases out
[1:13:35] <gunzerkingdunce> Use the follow up punch! There's a second rhythm game now
[1:13:37] <devanmuse> the game ENDS with a tutorial on a new mechanic
[1:13:37] <%JustToWatch> In DMC 6 they gotta fight demon king piccolo
[1:13:38] <%PeaceCentennial> go quick
[1:13:39] <hotrax> But buster arm
[1:13:44] <+DismalDavid> post game nero zoneGasm
[1:13:45] <CappuccinoGuil> I accidentally pressed start and SKIPPED this sequence, so I'm hyped AF right no
[1:13:45] <+mcjimbo12> @PalmtopNami Why? some people seem super mad about the ending and I don't get it. There are more cutscenes coming too
[1:13:46] <SailingSaturn> Still not sure what Robo Buster arm is used for now cirThink
[1:13:46] <dero45> Also how did Neto have robo arms during Vergil fight ?
[1:13:47] <Theomeny> this whole game is Shonen Anime TURBO mode (tm)
[1:13:47] <sukiyakiwestern> breakers have to come back, them withe the DT give nero so many options with only one weapon
[1:13:47] <+Dovakhin573> Dont forget you can also ORAORA while attacking enemies now too
[1:13:48] <%PeaceCentennial> the enemy kill thing is actually pretty hard in this one
[1:13:48] <FatDragonQuest> guessing it's just a few remainingqlipoth or a random cult summoned em
[1:13:48] <Joey1995456> Look, dante can take an impalement every game, why not nero being able to regrow limbs
[1:13:48] <$rytyoung> @mayorrev Dino may cry 2 dlc for sure
[1:13:51] <Prevot> man that song was a total spoiler wasn't it? LUL
[1:13:52] <VRNK> so what, they just reintroduce a whole ass mechanic for the final boss fight and credits scene?
[1:13:52] <dero45> Nero
[1:13:53] <%Toynota10> This makes the Buster Arm from Nico completely useless now
[1:13:53] <%sshen> Shinji MIKAMI?
[1:13:54] <%DirtyGaijin> Nero is back baby
[1:13:54] <DetroitSentai> The DT grab on the queens is so fucking good
[1:13:55] <%Kravedarknesss> @KaptainKappathe5th they're in hell again having sick shirtless battles in the rain
[1:13:56] <%PeaceCentennial> gotta use your DT
[1:13:56] <%Niney_Who> POWERBOMB
[1:13:59] <+Exyoh> SHINJI MIKAMI THO
[1:13:59] <cerberuscarmine> i love this song
[1:14:04] <stirlingw17> you can also get extra punches in with this as well as exceeding
[1:14:05] <KaptainKappathe5th> @Kravedarknesss nice
[1:14:05] <theshillman> F
[1:14:06] <+DeRedBaron> it's amazing how for the majority of the game nero has just a health and colorup meter but now they add the DT basically for NG+
[1:14:06] <Picosunloaded> F

[1:14:18] <Theomeny> the User Interface team deserve a gosh-darn award tho
[1:14:19] <adregun> pretty sure that nero didn't literally regrow the arm lol, when he put on the gauntlet his arm grew blue
[1:14:19] <+Sp3ctre48> Nero is turbo broken now

[1:14:32] <%DirtyGaijin> bang bang on my devil breaker
[1:14:34] <KaptainKappathe5th> i think this game is the best advertisement devil may cry 6 could ever hope for
[1:14:34] <%PalmtopNami> I am happy I did not buy this game. everything was rad up until the ending
[1:14:35] <masso101> Prediction: start dmc6 as Dante with his full moveset from this game. Then he dies. Nero mission 1
[1:14:35] <%Birdigalore> SORRRRRRRYA
[1:14:40] <$XeroSigmaPrime> Stream May Stop 5
[1:14:40] <+DeRedBaron> funny thing is, you can use both wire snatch and regular snatch
[1:14:42] <reonome> PULL MY DEVIL TRIGGER
[1:14:45] <$HentaiSenpai9K> @prevot The minute the song was revealed I was telling everyone it's literally talking about someone awakening their DT
[1:14:46] <%SrG00SE> happy pat makes me happy
[1:14:48] <%PeaceCentennial> There we goi
[1:14:49] <Jeemukun> so if you run outta breakers does nero just like, have his arm there normally?
[1:14:52] <$rytyoung> I need to see what his arm looks like when using punchline! cmonBruh
[1:14:55] <powerprotoman> look at onimusha nero
[1:14:56] <%PeaceCentennial> @Jeemukun Yes
[1:14:56] <+abrokemusician> you also get the big charge shot on top of the color up thing now! for some rerason!
[1:14:59] <+Exyoh> Thinking about it, Mikami seems *really* good with environments with his track record
[1:15:00] <VRNK> SHE IS ADOPTED SISTER
[1:15:00] <%Albadabar> He's got a Berzerker Barrage
[1:15:01] <TheDr0t> @angriestpat how much damage dt tomboy combo does?
[1:15:03] <dragoon001914> @AngriestPat Will you show us the secret ending too?

[1:15:19] <+PleasantLee> @Adam_Wayne excellent
[1:15:20] <$ooblagis> @PleasantLee Yeah, beat DMD mode to unlock the Super costumes
[1:15:20] <$XeroSigmaPrime> I'd fuck DT Nero so hard
[1:15:21] <%Toynota10> @angriestpat this makes Nico's buster arm useless lol
[1:15:21] <+Bloodxb> both
[1:15:21] <RantingRavager> OTOTO
[1:15:21] <Jeemukun> that's probably fine
[1:15:22] <Mr_216> F
[1:15:23] <%PeaceCentennial> i mean all the DTs are fuckable to someone
[1:15:25] <th3madness> meanwhile, in a cooler place
[1:15:27] <%sshen> So now buster arm is useless
[1:15:27] <%Adam_Wayne> @eiightbiit april and probably, along with Vergil
[1:15:27] <%Alopekis> That's going to cause a lot of destruction
[1:15:30] <dekkitout> That's right, Dante
[1:15:31] <%H0rnedG0d> thaaats right
[1:15:31] <PhazeShift> now we beat the game in dante must die?
[1:15:31] <RealPT1> is there any real difference to using bringer over wire snatch now?
[1:15:32] <%ShaneWhite> No it’s not
[1:15:34] <Dragon_Batman> So can you still use the normal breaker or no
[1:15:35] <%BigNerdSam> TEXTURE POP-IN SlGHTED
[1:15:37] <frenchdipp> "your like a brother to me"
[1:15:37] <gunzerkingdunce> They can leave whenever
[1:15:37] <krksobk> the boyz
[1:15:38] <%Klefth> So petty, lol
[1:15:38] <KaptainKappathe5th> THIS IS HYPE
[1:15:38] <%wolfofsound> man virgil sounds like a fucking nerd
[1:15:39] <$rytyoung> they're stands how can they be fuckable?!
[1:15:39] <VRNK> nico confirmed gay sister KappaPride
[1:15:43] <%PeaceCentennial> buster arm still does more damage on a break age
[1:15:44] <stirlingw17> @AngriestPat you miss not being able to guard fly?
[1:15:47] <devanmuse> "last time you were in hell, it didn't end well for you, Vergil."
[1:15:48] <+Exyoh> Is THIS thing the Bloody Palace?
[1:15:48] <%DirtyGaijin> and just like that they are fine
[1:15:51] <DetroitSentai> you have BOTH
[1:15:52] <%SergeEXE> Except Buster Arm
[1:15:52] <%PeaceCentennial> no he meant specifically Buster Arm
[1:15:53] <eiightbiitt> sweet
[1:15:54] <th3madness> what about buster arm
[1:15:55] <IsaiahOmega> did you try buster jabs yet?
[1:15:56] <%Niney_Who> It makes the DMC4 arm useless
[1:15:57] <gunzerkingdunce> You can Tomboy and Snatch
[1:15:57] <T_Sasquatch> you have both
[1:15:58] <%sshen> The buster arm pat
[1:15:59] <+mcjimbo12> It makes Buster Arm useless
[1:15:59] <+Dovakhin573> it just make buster breaker kinda useless
[1:16:00] <%Toynota10> not the breakers. just Nico's buster arm that can do the throw
[1:16:01] <DetroitSentai> You can charge a breaker while snatching
[1:16:01] <%Niney_Who> Except for the breakage
[1:16:01] <RantingRavager> S U B H U M A N
[1:16:02] <%SergeEXE> Buster Arm is REDUNDANT now
[1:16:02] <Dragon_Batman> What are their inputs?
[1:16:02] <+atomic_lobster> buster arm does more damage so i've heard
[1:16:02] <%hntronium> Can you play as Vergil?
[1:16:02] <hotrax> What about buster arm
[1:16:03] <+thenoodle007> I AM A MANGO
[1:16:03] <%Niney_Who> YEYEYEYEYE
[1:16:04] <rosabellamelantha> DO CREDITS GOOD
[1:16:04] <mayorrev> oh boy subhuman
[1:16:04] <iamnotaparrot> buster does more damage
[1:16:05] <Tucker0603> @angriestpat what about buster?
[1:16:05] <dero45> Also why can’t Vergil just make a portal with Yamato to get out
[1:16:06] <$lolslowking> Buster Arm grabs are far stronger
[1:16:06] <%Alopekis> Secret mission 21?
[1:16:07] <krksobk> you can still guard fly
[1:16:07] <$PaleBloodInk> Is there a point to the buster then?
[1:16:07] <%PalmtopNami> Virgil is lame and ugly now wow
[1:16:07] <Oqzar> still sucks that its gone
[1:16:08] <reonome> YOU CANNOT KILL ME
[1:16:10] <%Alopekis> :D
[1:16:12] <@Moobot> Whoa I don't even shout that much! (@GameXful2)
[1:16:15] <%Josef_Stryker> YOU CANNOT KILL ME
[1:16:15] <dukenux> I AM OMEGA
[1:16:17] <xtremegamer80> Ooooooooo a DMC 3 Credits!
[1:16:18] <Videogamer4> PogChamp
[1:16:18] <Pat_Squared> buster break are is still kinda useful in that it can't be interrupted I think
[1:16:19] <krksobk> it's harder, but still possible
[1:16:19] <Sapphire_Breeze> @th3madness I think the break age of the buster arm is more powerful so it's semi-useful
[1:16:21] <sukiyakiwestern> Rebellion > Devil Sword
[1:16:22] <%Mycalico> @AngriestPat I like how Virgil is basically Vegeta at this point.
[1:16:23] <+Bad1uck> Please tell me this can be done co-op
[1:16:24] <ivansonic08> I AM SUBHUMAN
[1:16:24] <$rytyoung> I didn't know you could use sin Dt here like a dumb dumb
[1:16:24] <%lewdskeletor13> @palmtopnami He’s not but ok
[1:16:25] <SnaKemuho> Vergil stealing kills here is a motherfucker
[1:16:26] <Alseid> oh no strem
[1:16:27] <%TrevyWeaponsGuy> God everyone's so busted by the end of 5
[1:16:27] <rosabellamelantha> LOOK AT THIS DLC VERGIL
[1:16:28] <prime_name> I still wish V could have gotten a credit sequence in some way.
[1:16:30] <%DirtyGaijin> those weapons tho
[1:16:30] <robin2098> Is there a point to the buster devil breaker now?
[1:16:30] <%TrevyWeaponsGuy> It's so fucking cool
[1:16:30] <KaptainKappathe5th> these are the best fucking credits in a videogame
[1:16:31] <minoh1> With Neros arm growing back does he still have a stump with no breaker equiped
[1:16:32] <+JayEarly> @toynota10 the charged buster arm does more damage but otherwise it is kinda obsolete
[1:16:34] <Pat_Squared> break age*
[1:16:34] <%Toynota10> YOU CAN NOT KILLL MEEEEE
[1:16:35] <Finaldragoon> not as shitty version of Subhuman PogChamp
[1:16:37] <%PeaceCentennial> funny how the mind something something something
[1:16:38] <+KaiserCrimson_1> Inb4 there's hidden 2 player just like in DMC3
[1:16:39] <%BigNerdSam> NO ONE CAN ESCAPE SUBHUMAN! NO ONE! fucking vocals...
[1:16:42] <+mcjimbo12> @PalmtopNami you seem mad salty about this ending dude yikes
[1:16:43] <masso101> Do you have to win both credits fights to get the secret ending?
[1:16:47] <jinking79> it make Buster Arm only useful in breakAGE
[1:16:47] <%Adam_Wayne> Oh hey look at this character with a complete moveset who isn't playable
[1:16:48] <%CerberusDriver> Subhuman 2.0 is genuinely good
[1:16:53] <gunzerkingdunce> DLC: Vergil's Rise
[1:16:53] <Dragon_Batman> Did I here you cannot kill us?
[1:16:53] <%Adam_Wayne> oh I wonder what they'll do with him
[1:16:54] <%H0rnedG0d> SUBHUMAN ISNT THAT BAD
[1:16:55] <Saturdaythe14th> The credit fights are for costumes I think
[1:16:56] <%Toynota10> @jayearly ahhhh true. and you can't be interrupted either
[1:17:01] <%lewdskeletor13> The okay version of subhuman
[1:17:02] <%PeaceCentennial> the secret to beating this one is to use SDT
[1:17:02] <%wolfofsound> @Adam_Wayne yet*
[1:17:03] <%DougintheTrench> @AngriestPat Won't spoil on what the EX Taunts are, I will say that V's is the best BY FAR!
[1:17:04] <%Albadabar> Kinda bummed we never get to see Sparda but I suppose that's for the best
[1:17:06] <+Exyoh> The new vocals are fine
[1:17:06] <$Sphincter_Spelunker> No, shhhhhhh. This Vergil is from 4SE. Not a future update. Shhhhhh
[1:17:10] <%DirtyGaijin> Is that little V doing sub human?
[1:17:11] <%sshen> This is pats 4th playthrough, he probably already has those costumes
[1:17:14] <th3madness> THE LUCE
[1:17:19] <$ooblagis> The Laser does SO MUCH damage
[1:17:20] <Videogamer4> PogChamp
[1:17:21] <reonome> I AM OMEGA
[1:17:21] <M4eta> what do you have to do to get the secret ending?
[1:17:25] <+Bad1uck> Pew pew pew wings
[1:17:35] <%Adam_Wayne> I can't wait to do coop with dante and vergil
[1:17:36] <%PeaceCentennial> I immediately switched Dante's battle theme to Devils Never Cry
[1:17:37] <%lewdskeletor13> YOU CANNOT KILL ME
[1:17:38] <+JayEarly> YOU CANNOT KILL ME
[1:17:38] <FatDragonQuest> I think I turned around on sword Dante when I learned that you can still use dance macabre
[1:17:38] <Saturdaythe14th> There are no endings for the credit fights
[1:17:40] <+thenoodle007> I AM A MANGO Kappa
[1:17:40] <Flamecap1> I MUST EXPLODE

[1:17:50] <%korth367> @AngriestPat should restart stream after this, shit ton of hiccups happening
[1:17:50] <Megapikman132> Yeah. like that
[1:17:51] <42nfl19> How do you do a buster then if the breaker has their default move still? @AngriestPat
[1:17:53] <thecrabgodrulerofcrabs> its almost like in the same datamine that suggested co op bloody palace there were signs of anothrr playable character
[1:17:54] <%Toynota10> @angriestpat you hear that rumor that DLC will be coming for a playable Lady, Trish, and Lucia?

[1:18:07] <IsaiahOmega> Buster is R2
[1:18:07] <+JayEarly> @42nfl19 R2

[1:18:08] <%SaltyDongs> BEST END
[1:18:08] <hotrax> @AngriestPat Is buster arm useless?
[1:18:09] <%drfaustisdead> buster and breaker have different buttons.
[1:18:09] <%DirtyGaijin> da true true end
[1:18:09] <indig0bird> Wait, Dante never gave back Lady her weird rocket launcher
[1:18:09] <VritraReiRei> @AngriestPat can you show us the joke ending?
[1:18:09] <%Ion_Laser> That was awesome!
[1:18:11] <+RatedRGibby> I got a tie last time
[1:18:16] <+Exyoh> I'm sweating after all that
[1:18:17] <%rdark_ksu> i showed up late so do it again
[1:18:17] <Saturdaythe14th> So the weirdest thing about co-op bloody palace is mission 7 has co-op in the boss
[1:18:18] <mastermidget23> Secret what now?
[1:18:18] <MihajloMBlood> So many Serbian names in the credits???
[1:18:19] <$D4C_Trice> What do you get from winning those two credit scenes?
[1:18:20] <aimlesshealer> Yeah! I beat the game so now I can watch Pat!
[1:18:21] <Saturdaythe14th> but nothing else in the game does
[1:18:22] <%PeaceCentennial> this song is great by the way
[1:18:23] <%griffball13> PIZZA TIME
[1:18:23] <%furiousfurioso> When I got to the end of these credits I just had a black screen and I had to force quit
[1:18:24] <EL3GYFighter> I love this song
[1:18:24] <+mcjimbo12> @Toynota10 Playable Lucia is an insane pipe dream, if that was the plan they'd have put Lucia in the game somehow
[1:18:27] <Saturdaythe14th> (This is not a secret this always plays)
[1:18:27] <%ShaneWhite> @angriestpat Good Stream Pat!
[1:18:27] <%hntronium> LADY
[1:18:28] <%Rngiddion> buster arm does twice as much damage as the natty buster
[1:18:29] <+Silentman0> you skipped the best part of the credits! SWERY worked on this!
[1:18:29] <virgule222> special taunts
[1:18:30] <$Sphincter_Spelunker> Whoo pizza threesome

[1:20:42] <42nfl19> @AngriestPat Look how they use each other's stances. Fucking poetic or some shit. Similar to how they traded swords in DMC3
[1:20:45] <+PleasantLee> now who is wrong here? Dante the idiot who cant count or Vergil the asshole who refuses to lose
[1:20:45] <sevelodon> i mean he's old
[1:20:45] <adregun> vergil finally lets go

[1:22:41] <+CaliggyJack> @AngriestPat I think it's because DMC5 is about Dante and Vergil discovering their opposite aspects. Dante discovers his Sin Devil Trigger, thereby embracing the demon within he previously rebuffed. And V merging with Uri is Vergil reclaiming his humanity, something Vergil didn't want.
[1:22:42] <Picosunloaded> YES

[1:23:39] <$MightyMaxT> Kinda Vergil colors. Its green instead
[1:23:40] <mastermidget23> I love how annoyed Vergil looks, I guess by the breaker? "Come on kid, don't get your powers from a gadget. Get it from blood, your own or someone else's."
[1:23:40] <Dragon_Batman> It's fine
[1:23:40] <SailingSaturn> you get it from the Crefit Sequences
[1:23:41] <+Bad1uck> So Dante is red, Vergil blue, and V green!
[1:23:41] <ravencloak13> @dukenux I was about to ask why green but that makes sense.
