[0:08:51] <%Rain_Mage> @AngriestPat So the Spanish Inquisition was originally founded to weed out priests who could not understand the Bible properly to improve the Spanish Priesthood's understanding of the Bible.

[0:11:43] <%dalmek> Cheer500 Small tip that the game explains, but not clearly imo. When you parry, you automatically counterattack, BUT if you hit Attack (X) the MOMENT your counterattack lands, you do more damage and then you can execute, which is important since the animations are cool
[0:11:44] <%Cynful_Zebra> This game is personally kicking my ass tho
[0:11:45] <%RubberFistFight> @GarbageNirvana yeah... it's gonna be baaaad, I tell ya what.

[0:17:19] <@lewdskeletor13> BabyRage
[0:17:20] <Archmortal> Zenitsu is like the literal worst character though?
[0:17:20] <bakkatohri> Nezuko is strongest cute
[0:17:20] <Louie_Salmon> Very relatable, I imagine
[0:17:22] <transporterthesequel> Well he is a big coward
[0:17:23] <%chronotriggerhappy123> no one hates nezuko, she's too adorable and pure kicking guy's heads off
[0:17:24] <%Nina96> i hate him his move r cool though
[0:17:24] <Hiruzen93> does he remind you of your childhood is that why?
[0:17:25] <%spacehouse> too bad the manga kicks Nezuko out of the plot
[0:17:26] <%SomeNEET> @AngriestPat do you identify with his babylegs?
[0:17:27] <b1gboss007> HES HE BEST
[0:17:28] <$rytyoung> He reminds me alot of Reigan from Mob!
[0:17:29] <%Engwithan_Elder_God> He's too damn loud.
[0:17:29] <%bevyrage> zenitsu is the embodiment of FOLDED 1,000 TIMES OVER philosophy
[0:17:30] <%dalmek> @griffball13 thank God I figured that out early, because not knowing that would suck
[0:17:32] <Ozmodyas> Not Inosuke the angry weirdo?
[0:17:35] <Gehtingsberg> Of course you do
[0:17:36] <%ShaneWhite> You would relate to him
[0:17:36] <%FrostMass22> He likes the crying bitch child because he is one damn
[0:17:38] <%valriot> @angriestpat Did you see the Griffith hairstyle in Iceborne?
[0:17:40] <JayEarly> I like the creepy butterfly girl
[0:17:40] <%Jay_Squirrel> if he figures out how to do that shit while awake he will be a ton better imo
[0:17:50] <majindusto> Nuzuko is The Most Cute!
[0:17:51] <%griffball13> @dalmek i didn't until my second playthrough which sucked
[0:17:58] <ahmz1404> I recommend swapping parry to L1 and health to R1
[0:17:58] <+allups> its true

[0:18:05] <%Soul_Intern> El maestro lloron Patricio le gusta el rubio pendejo
[0:18:06] <%StaceMcGate> Nezuko's voice actress got a sweet gig

The original founder of the Inquisition also founded several catholic universities in Spain. The founder was actually sympathetic to Protestants because he was a cool scholar guy.

[0:24:08] <SilverFaustX> retroFAT
[0:24:08] <+Cervarian> @ElenaManetta The FCC makes it illegal to not tell us when people are shills... effectiveness/enforcement may vary MiniK

[0:24:32] <%brickwall35> !sellout
[0:24:32] <%griffball13> ALWAYS SELL OUT
[0:24:32] <@Moobot> "If you *ever* have the opportunity to sell out you sell out as hard as you can it will be the best thing that ever happened to your fucking life! No one ever regretted selling out, except for 'artists' who care about their 'integrity' 'n shit." ~Pat 2016
[0:24:32] <%King_Wolf_Rigger> !sellout
[0:24:33] <%joylent_blue> makes sense
[0:24:35] <%Jay_Squirrel> those redbulls lasted like a week,. yeh?
[0:24:36] <%ElenaManetta> I thought Pat was saying the FCC makes it so you can't force people to lie
[0:24:37] <+allups> BUT THEN IT DOESNT COUNT
[0:24:37] <Caidezes> FREE MONEY
[0:24:38] <LodiFrostbeard> PLAY GAEM
[0:24:39] <%Totally_not_toby> hell yeah selling out rules
[0:24:40] <%JenovasPuppet> Literally did that with FFXIV. Just a happy coincidence that he already liked the game.
[0:24:40] <MidnightBurst12> get that paper
[0:24:41] <$rytyoung> But what if they add microtransactions later and you hate it?
[0:24:41] <srkAres> "would you take basically free money" fucking yeah i would
[0:24:42] <Rayorin> @AngriestPat I like it. Responsible, transparent greed
[0:24:42] <%BallerSwagBro9k> CHAOTIC EVIL
[0:24:42] <%crimsonharvest> I want to draw attention to this man's hat before we start. It's called a capirote and is intended, i think, to indicate / compel penitence
[0:24:42] <+WhiskeyInTheJamJar> Paid in RedBulls > Paid in Peanuts
[0:24:43] <@lewdskeletor13> Selling out is a good thing kids
[0:24:44] <zerocruz> Why do you fools refuse to sellout ?
[0:24:44] <+CourageTheCat> @AngriestPat would you sell out for a game you hated
[0:24:44] <%Gogogolem> Pat would say , hey guys this games great, wink, they gave me 50 dollars to review it.
[0:24:45] <Jontman42> You have no integrity to begin with so
[0:24:46] <@commanderclaw> !sellout

[0:24:49] <%arcaderabbit48> I wasn't able to play League for about a year, due to shitty internet at my apartment, and didn't have the budget to afford most real games. It sucked, but I dealt with it because I didn't want to ruin the experience for 9 other people. Fuck anyone who does. What's even the point of playing if only half of your hits are connecting, and your character's movement is best described as a Microsoft PowerPoint?
[0:24:49] <worldbrand> we know how pat pees. what integrity.
[0:24:51] <jerobees> "Yo they payed me like $1000 to make this review so don't trust it lmao"
[0:24:51] <+PlainClothesHero> @AngriestPat Will you ever play Chrono Cross so you can just shit on it once and for all?

[0:24:55] <%Ranryu692> Patton Oswalt has a great bit about how great selling out is
[0:24:57] <%averyoddjew> i'm surprised they lasted months

[0:25:14] <kingbaconcrispy> Yes, coming back from a hard day's work to find Pat streaming. Everything's coming up Milhouse.
[0:25:15] <deviljhojho94> Very catholic
[0:25:15] <%RubberFistFight> @AngriestPat what you just described is literally just a business relationship. Anybody who'd call that "selling out" as if it's the same as shilling with no integrity is a narrowminded dipshit.
[0:25:15] <%jeffishype> did someone gift subs just now??

[0:28:47] <%RubberFistFight> @Rayorin actually the game is super unclear on if it's bile or blood in there. For starters, bile ain't the colour of blood - it's usually rather striking green, or yellowish.
[0:28:48] <%KoyaMusa> oh yeah there is bottomless pits in this game
[0:28:48] <%joylent_blue> FirearmsInstructor i think he started an hour late?? so you were both late :P

[0:35:45] <worldbrand> there are PLENTY of other hells
[0:35:46] <%starotter70> The Bible is BRUTAL
[0:35:46] <%Dr_Mooose> religion is metal
[0:35:46] <+Kingjhon8> pretty sure it was some other relgion
[0:35:47] <juxtest> Jesus was the real Metal all along
[0:35:47] <Run44forrest> you have lost jesus privelge
[0:35:48] <%linSP> jesus was a hippie though
[0:35:48] <%RubberFistFight> Man, only idiots who've never looked at their hands believe Jesus was crucified through his palms. Which by extension, makes "stigmata wounds" that appear anywhere other than the wrists complete and total obvious bullshit fabrications.
[0:35:50] <LaughingCatt> Most other Hell's arent nearly as intense
[0:35:50] <Jontman42> That's completely not true but I get the sentiment
[0:35:50] <%mh9s> ehhhhh soooooorta

[0:36:19] <zerocruz> RULES OF NATUREEEEE
[0:36:20] <BoneBagMel> Ex-catholic here: Catholisism Is full of pain, self harm, penitence and is pretty fucking mashochist
[0:36:21] <%ryome> Parrying is just turning the other cheek

[0:36:36] <jerobees> 're not skeletons
[0:36:37] <%Solidnick18> this game is dope
[0:36:37] <cureneckbeard> The wheel was a traditional torture method in olden times.
[0:36:38] <+mcjimbo12> @Crushter why would you say anything lol just keep quiet
[0:36:40] <+Someitalian123> Yeah, but dante alighieri invented our visions of hell, until he wrote the inferno hell wasn't specifically seen as a place of suffering
[0:36:42] <%RubberFistFight> Jesus was crucified with the nails between the bones of his wrists - if they'd used his palms then his hands would have just messily split in half and he'd have fallen off the cross.
[0:36:42] <%griffball13> @AngriestPat for that missible quest you want to go to the snow first
[0:36:43] <+Grayhammatter> rip and tear until it's don
[0:36:44] <%ElenaManetta> What could those blood vials on the hud mean

[0:46:27] <%RubberFistFight> @AngriestPat "by my fault". He's The Penitent One, dude. It's all thematic and shit.
[0:46:27] <Louie_Salmon> No, your sword is Mea Culpa
[0:46:29] <Coystick> Put it all into GUILT
[0:46:30] <%RantingRavager> GUILT BLADE

[0:46:39] <%logoth_> This game has the most gothic font I've seen this week
[0:46:39] <%Solidnick18> more combo
[0:46:40] <krymzen5> stinger tho
[0:46:40] <lethallylactic> Plunge Attack is gud
[0:46:41] <+aslfrasle> Hell Fire, Dark Fire, Now Patrick it's your turn!
[0:46:41] <%dukenux> What other game had Guilt thing?
[0:46:41] <benjiFG> plunge
[0:46:41] <%hntronium> WEIGHT OF SIN
[0:46:42] <+CourageTheCat> AY YO WHAT GUILT BUILD YOU RINNIN
[0:46:42] <ShoggothLord> It's also a fancy Latin way to say "I'm sorry."
[0:46:42] <%Dakuu75> sacred STINGER
[0:46:43] <+Grayhammatter> yo, those pictures are rad
[0:46:44] <+CourageTheCat> *RUNNING
[0:46:44] <%CaityCoopScoops> is this the true guilty dear
[0:46:45] <%1matheuw> sinful wrath is a sick name for an attack wth
[0:46:47] <Tucker0603> plunge and hat bitch
[0:46:48] <%dukenux> oh right, that Surgeon game on Wii
[0:46:49] <%Solidnick18> oh stinger
[0:46:50] <morow1ec> Stinger is super strong
[0:46:51] <%averyoddjew> most reliable move in the game
[0:46:52] <Doodle_Taco> SIN DEVIL TRIGGER WHEN?
[0:46:53] <Crushter> the dash attack is godly
[0:46:53] <$drfaustisdead> @AngriestPat Sacred thrust is money.
[0:46:54] <+CourageTheCat> Oh, STinger?
[0:46:54] <heart_ablaze> The names of all these attacks are so cool
[0:46:54] <McAngrimStein> Means my bad dawg
[0:46:55] <ALazo> Sounds dumb tbh. Like engrish sounds cool but makes no sense.
[0:46:57] <%Engwithan_Elder_God> YES
[0:46:59] <+CaptainGrime> yoooo
[0:46:59] <Mister_McDerp> bearer of the guilt seek seek lest

[0:47:02] <%Laecerelius> We Link now, boys!
[0:47:03] <Ner234> Weight of Sin is a strong name for a plunging attack
[0:47:04] <beetbo2> Sacred Thrust Kreygasm
[0:47:07] <%StaceMcGate> Ye Not Guilty
[0:47:11] <%joylent_blue> i assume we mentioned how the currency icon is just the curse mark from berserk
[0:47:12] <majindusto> IT'S NOT MY FAULT, I'M NOT TO BLAME
[0:47:13] <%RubberFistFight> fucken... mea culpa, "tears of atonement", and there's one other thing he has yet to learn. But basically the theme is ARE YOU FEELING THE CATHOLIC SHAME YET?
[0:47:14] <%vaporousTippler> That shit was great in Zelda 2 and hasn't lost a step.
[0:47:15] <%logoth_> cant go that way gotta go this way
[0:47:18] <Coystick> I don't like that you do a vestigial slash before the downthrust triggers
[0:47:22] <%goose_attack_almanac> It's not my fault! I'm not to blame! It is that Gypsy girl that Witch who set this flame! It's not my fault, If in God's plan.. He Made the Devil so much stronger than a Man!
[0:47:22] <Louie_Salmon> I believe it does more damage the higher you fall from
[0:47:24] <%Solidnick18> yeah
[0:47:24] <%tweedler92> So if you jerk off would that be infinite levels?
[0:47:25] <krymzen5> its good!
[0:47:27] <+RiceeFTW> this game's art and style is super rad

[0:47:31] <not_twitter_rowan> it's real good
[0:47:33] <soraabora> same
[0:47:35] <Louie_Salmon> Very grimy
[0:47:36] <%Solidnick18> i like it
[0:47:36] <%chronotriggerhappy123> yeah, its amazingly low rez
[0:47:38] <%starotter70> Wow, Sellout! But no yeah, this game looks sick
[0:47:38] <%InugamiTheHound> ye not guilty,cast in the name of God
[0:47:38] <+RiceeFTW> you can change it
[0:47:39] <moragtang> I think that's exactly it.
[0:47:41] <+arfsm95> @AngriestPat there's a place to go out on the secret room
[0:47:42] <%happyface699> It’s fucking awesome
[0:47:43] <%dukenux> KINO resolution
[0:47:43] <+CourageTheCat> show it to woolie to activate his tragic backstory
[0:47:44] <+aversal_ammar> THE CHECK CAME THROUGH
[0:47:45] <Coystick> Works on integrated graphics card on my tablet flawlessly
[0:47:45] <%StaceMcGate> apatSmug is good
[0:47:46] <%Solidnick18> filth Kreygasm
[0:47:47] <Thirtine> catholic grunge Kreygasm
[0:47:47] <%Evil_John_Cena> Wait this shit came out?
[0:47:48] <+luftraumm1> @angriestpat platforming is irritating tho
[0:47:49] <%Zero_Awakening> enbPraise I knew you'd love it!!
[0:47:49] <$drfaustisdead> @StaceMcGate +10 for the Big O Reference.
[0:47:51] <%AgentOrangeShoes> ITS SO GNARLY
[0:47:52] <%firehawk_420> Same, I love everything about this.
[0:47:53] <JayEarly> The plunge attack might have Iframes?
[0:47:54] <%FirearmsInstructor> @AngriestPat What game does this look similar to? (Not shovel night... something else.)
[0:47:57] <%GarbageNirvana> In other words you could probably get this to run on toast
[0:47:58] <%hntronium> Cool
[0:47:58] <%ElenaManetta> It captures "old video game" visuals as well as Cuphead captured old animation
[0:47:58] <not_twitter_rowan> But getting 100%/the secrets/true ending is way too obscure, imo
[0:47:59] <Mendin> It's like Actrazer HD, clean as shit pixel
[0:48:00] <%RubberFistFight> @AngriestPat eyyy, I figured you'd like it, hence why I pushed it at you so hard. Shame about the bugs but hey, tiny indie studio and all.
[0:48:00] <$drfaustisdead> This game's great
[0:48:00] <%GarbageNirvana> Not even a toaster, the toast itself
[0:48:00] <%ChaosAethr> It looks Like a GBA Game
[0:48:00] <@commanderclaw> This game's art looks so good and it looks like it took a million years to make
[0:48:01] <%hntronium> Tips
[0:48:03] <%crimsonharvest> this looks like if 3d hardware had never been invented and 2d games just kept getting cooler
[0:48:04] <moragtang> Don't go there yet tbh.
[0:48:04] <krymzen5> platformings a lil hard
[0:48:05] <Ner234> What are you playing this on Pat?
[0:48:05] <Parapattern> You need the graininess

[0:48:16] <%starotter70> The best part of Latin is that no one speaks it, so it doesn't matter how dumb it sounds

[0:50:08] <$Sphincter_Spelunker> "used to be"
[0:50:09] <Parapattern> The baby cage is a bit distracting
[0:50:10] <Louie_Salmon> @jay_squirrel That's because it didn't exist until this moment, but as soon as he vocalized that it didn't, [CRAZY TALK] added it as a feature.
[0:50:12] <MForan98> BABY CAGE ?!
[0:50:13] <+RiceeFTW> they are CHILDREN OF THE MOONLIGHT
[0:50:14] <%Big_Dream> @floralkami used to be

[0:51:53] <Crushter> @walopoh it's not Christianity, it just takes it's themes and aesthetic
[0:51:55] <%moogleboy1984> grabbing the ledges is WAY too aggressive
[0:51:56] <+buttdirt> yeah, this game has really aggresive ledge grabbing
[0:52:00] <Coystick> Spike Pits are the hardest enemies in the game

[0:52:35] <friggenheck> how can spikes be bad? you have plenty of spikes on your sword and armor?
[0:52:35] <moragtang> Yeah, they don't use crosses. This game is legit Legally Distinct Catholicism.

[0:52:41] <%1matheuw> you get a sick item by jumping straight into those spikes
[0:52:42] <+PenmanLupine> Megaman Spikes
[0:52:48] <+RiceeFTW> you can jump cancel the dash
[0:52:48] <%chronotriggerhappy123> yes, slide dodge has a cd
[0:52:50] <%StaceMcGate> I can't wait to be king, remember the monkeys...
[0:52:51] <LaughingCatt> It's the Tower of Heaven as a whole game
[0:52:52] <Ner234> Universes like this and Dark Souls are just so ... awful and grimy. It makes you wonder: Is everyone everywhere miserable all the time or is this just a small slice of a really bad section.
[0:52:52] <%RubberFistFight> @AngriestPat this has a similar shortcut mechanic to Souls, so if you see an area with no clear access, chances are you access it from the other side via a passage or unlockable door. So don't panic too much.
[0:52:55] <+SolverCODO> It's the circle of fuuuuuuuck, and it's aaall fucked uuuuuup
[0:52:57] <%starotter70> I'm waiting for someone to say: DO NOT AVERT YOUR EYES
[0:53:00] <%Soul_Intern> Yeah this game is too interesting, Im gonnafocus entirely on it and go fullscreen LUL
[0:53:00] <krymzen5> yep eerything
[0:53:05] <lexiliat_33> too soon
[0:53:07] <D3va> @angriestpat if you down press up while hanging from a ledge, you will keep hanging. Makes it easier to drop down
[0:53:08] <+RiceeFTW> nope
[0:53:09] <%bevyrage> @RiceeFTW does it retain momentum? can you wave dash?
[0:53:09] <%Calek> "This contraption will not move"
[0:53:09] <%chronotriggerhappy123> not yet
[0:53:10] <majindusto> God Damn Megaman Spikes
[0:53:10] <Louie_Salmon> Time stop
[0:53:11] <%moogleboy1984> not yet
[0:53:11] <StarsCrusader> Not yet
[0:53:12] <%averyoddjew> thing for later
[0:53:13] <%Zero_Awakening> @AngriestPat you cant get this baby or switch till later
[0:53:14] <Jetsfantasy> later
[0:53:14] <kylecorr> is this like dark souls and castlevania combined
[0:53:15] <%1matheuw> 33
[0:53:17] <Crushter> later thing
[0:53:17] <Djinnazz> Need some type of throwing weapon it seems
[0:53:18] <krymzen5> need timestop
[0:53:19] <$drfaustisdead> You can not.
[0:53:19] <LaughingCatt> yes
[0:53:19] <+Grayhammatter> can't get that jesus
[0:53:20] <%luckysteak> you have not unlocked switches yet
[0:53:21] <%chronotriggerhappy123> juuuust out of reach
[0:53:21] <etoir> look at this Bloodstained village level
[0:53:21] <%crimsonharvest> that switch is already in the pulled position looks like
[0:53:21] <T_Sasquatch> you need time stop
[0:53:22] <+RiceeFTW> @bevyrage lmaoo naw not crazy movement tech
[0:53:23] <%griffball13> @AngriestPat you can't get that one yet
[0:53:30] <%bevyrage> damn but also good
[0:53:30] <%hntronium> Don't think you can reach the child
[0:53:31] <Ner234> No Jesus for you Patrick
[0:53:35] <%logoth_> This looks way better than Deaths Gambit
[0:53:36] <D3va> dont press up* EU debuff atpRtsd
[0:53:37] <%moogleboy1984> @kylecorr it is exactly thatr
[0:53:37] <CapCasual> @AngriestPat It needs time-stop to work.
[0:53:38] <%ChaosAethr> Also Like that castlevania world on Netflix
[0:53:42] <%floralkami> I really like how tight the controls seem.
[0:53:42] <LandOfTheWay> @kylecorr pretty much, with a heavy dose of catholicism
[0:53:42] <%StaceMcGate> but stinger tho
[0:53:42] <Thirtine> get stinger
[0:53:43] <Crushter> @angriestpat get the slide attack
[0:53:48] <Crushter> trust
[0:53:48] <StarsCrusader> Sinful Wrath is useless, btw
[0:53:50] <+RiceeFTW> @logoth_ which is a shame, since I was excited for Death's Gambit
[0:53:50] <majindusto> JUICE PLZ
[0:53:52] <LandOfTheWay> like, even more than those games
[0:53:53] <%Soul_Intern> YES
[0:53:55] <%hntronium> Does it feel strong
[0:53:57] <+RiceeFTW> but this game is great
[0:53:57] <%Zero_Awakening> never used that attack ever
[0:53:58] <%starotter70> @AngriestPat How does the game Feel?
[0:53:59] <ISkyHunterI> @AngriestPat This move is shit
[0:53:59] <%derekwst3> @AngriestPat if you like this, you would love banjo kazooie
[0:53:59] <krymzen5> that move sucks till the lasp upgrade
[0:54:02] <%Soul_Intern> YES FUCK YES
[0:54:04] <Coystick> Haven't found much use for the charge attack
[0:54:04] <Ominnous> Holy Homerun Swing
[0:54:05] <+RiceeFTW> this move is really useful
[0:54:09] <jerobees> That's a real slow charge
[0:54:10] <%JonaFett69> So where's jesus? are you jesus?
[0:54:11] <metrying> look at that dark souls stance
[0:54:12] <%Laecerelius> Get that stinger!
[0:54:14] <%moogleboy1984> Sinful Thrust is god tier
[0:54:16] <%happyface699> This games only 23 bucks
[0:54:17] <%Yadogari> Slide attack is AMAZING
[0:54:18] <%bevyrage> that's good anti-air but you need to have some reads for sure
[0:54:18] <%Teyaric> a bit lame in early game, but the charge attack is legit later
[0:54:18] <%ChaosAethr> Not Stinger?
[0:54:19] <Jetsfantasy> The move is good if you can be safe during the charge
[0:54:19] <%RubberFistFight> @StarsCrusader what are you talking about, it's super handy for a specific enemy in a later area.
[0:54:21] <worldbrand> "juice my shit" made my hairs stand on end
[0:54:22] <+Walopoh> Petinent One could be in Smash PogChamp
[0:54:22] <%Soul_Intern> @JonaFett69 Maybe
[0:54:24] <%Big_Dream> mid max
[0:54:24] <%Solidnick18> makes sense
[0:54:28] <%crimsonharvest> i think jesus is your sword?
[0:54:29] <%StaceMcGate> Jesus is a lady
[0:54:30] <%Nina96> prob
[0:54:30] <%chronotriggerhappy123> jesus is on your sword man
[0:54:30] <+BruceyG> The dash attack is so fucking good
[0:54:31] <%logoth_> everyone is Jesus
[0:54:31] <mostundesired> Yes. And also no.
[0:54:31] <+Grayhammatter> i do not think we are the jesus
[0:54:31] <riotshark> off brand jesus
[0:54:31] <%Engwithan_Elder_God> Jesus is in all of us.
[0:54:33] <%Calek> money is not an issue in this game
[0:54:33] <%dalmek> you saw Jesus at the very beginning of the game
[0:54:34] <+RiceeFTW> time to min max this game with no gear LUL
[0:54:34] <Crushter> you're not Jesus
[0:54:35] <%RubberFistFight> @AngriestPat you are SPANISH CATHOLIC JEEBUS
[0:54:35] <%Calek> like at all
[0:54:35] <sonofthedeepsouth> Based Catholic Icons giving us sick sword magics
[0:54:36] <Djinnazz> No one fucks with the Jesus.
[0:54:37] <Ner234> This move is shit. This move is useful. LUL Never change chat LUL
[0:54:37] <%1matheuw> jesus is inside us
[0:54:37] <%Zutrax> Just to let Pat know there are shops so saving for those is better than the moves in a lot of cases.
[0:54:37] <%Laecerelius> When everyone is Jesus, nobody is Jesus
[0:54:37] <Louie_Salmon> You have to be really careful when you use that swing, but it's strong
[0:54:39] <%bevyrage> BLASPHEMY!
[0:54:39] <@commanderclaw> Everything is Jesus
[0:54:39] <%miguelrod777> world where Jesus never came

[0:54:44] <%Dr_Mooose> buy killing shit
[0:54:45] <$drfaustisdead> @AngriestPat btw if you hold B you'll do a quicksilver bullet gain for fervor.
[0:54:45] <%ElenaManetta> If you're Jesus, call Woolie up right now because this is his ideal version of Jesus
[0:54:46] <%ScreamLord> Is there even a Jesus in this world?
[0:54:46] <%moogleboy1984> Jesus is everywhere. Break a Skull and he is there
[0:54:46] <%crimsonharvest> you didnt rest at a shrine

[0:54:50] <%dekkitout> The real Jesus was the friends we flagellated along the way
[0:54:50] <%Gogogolem> Sponge

[0:54:51] <+aslfrasle> Sounds like Jesus to me.

[0:54:52] <alwayspronking> you haven't rested
[0:54:52] <%mortalitas87> sounds like a jesus
[0:54:54] <soraabora> thats very jesus-y
[0:54:54] <%vaporousTippler> Jesus was the first Dark Souls game.
[0:54:54] <%Diabetic> you haven't saved
[0:54:55] <Parapattern> If this were actually Catholicism, Mary would be fucking EVERYWHERE
[0:54:56] <%hntronium> You haven't prayed at a shrine yet
[0:54:57] <Jetsfantasy> bonfire system

[0:55:07] <%Typhaeon> It's a flat level, and you can buy any skill at that level
[0:55:10] <Rayorin> Just like dark souls
[0:55:11] <%floralkami> @jetsfantasy there's a parry to get the opening for the attack
[0:55:13] <moragtang> Well. You're k i n d a Jesus, but if God sent Jesus to kill everyone who worships false idols like they were God.
[0:55:14] <%luckysteak> that is the most blasphemous thing about this game. Making the atonement of Jesus less than the singular event that it was.
[0:55:15] <Rayorin> lol

[0:55:59] <%RubberFistFight> @StarsCrusader big stony coffin bois. takes em out in 2 hits, versus like 6 with a bunch of parrying.
[0:56:01] <worldbrand> do executions do anything for you or are they just cool?
[0:56:01] <antthefool> Holy shit that was raw
[0:56:01] <+BruceyG> That good crunch
[0:56:01] <%moogleboy1984> @AngriestPat just to let you know, there are some moves you can't Parry, but it still blocks the hit
[0:56:05] <shevan123> WOW
[0:56:06] <Ner234> This game is grimy and morbid. It's great
[0:56:06] <%Soul_Intern> SPLAT ON THESE PUSSIES
[0:56:07] <%starotter70> It's really strong
[0:56:09] <%Big_Dream> more dicks
[0:56:11] <%ElenaManetta> If only Buddhism was this metal and radical, people would be making video games about that.
[0:56:12] <krymzen5> i missed that
[0:56:17] <+paladinstarbuster> The statue enemies are chickks
[0:56:17] <%dukenux> Avalon?
[0:56:20] <+KamenOtaku> Aquaman?
[0:56:23] <%Zutrax> I'm genuinely surprised Twitch allows this game with the amount of nudity, especially with later NPC's.
[0:56:24] <ObsidianDragon86> Hinduism is Pretty Metal
[0:56:27] <riotshark> i hope after you collect all these bones they turn into a wicked boss
[0:56:29] <+superkeaton> @ElenaManetta you should check out Buddist Hell
[0:56:29] <%happyface699> Aquaman
[0:56:31] <%dalmek> @ElenaManetta Does Asura's Wrath count?
[0:56:33] <ObsidianDragon86> Demons and Wars and Blood
[0:56:33] <Coystick> Mechanically it's a 5 or 6, average, Aesthetically it's a 11/10
[0:56:34] <%StaceMcGate> but can The Penitent One dab on bosses? @AngriestPat
[0:56:35] <%RubberFistFight> @paladinstarbuster so are the ones with shields, there's obvious boobage
[0:56:36] <+paladinstarbuster> WHENS GREGORIOS
[0:56:39] <%KoyaMusa> @ElenaManetta Omikron is a buddhist game according to david cage :^)
[0:56:40] <worldbrand> Yeah I get those vibes
[0:56:41] <sonofthedeepsouth> Where is my Byzantine orthodox souls-like game?
[0:56:41] <+stupidsquid> pat how is the game so far?
[0:56:42] <%Calek> @Zutrax as long as nudity isn't the focus of the content it's fine
[0:56:46] <%Hydrapissed> very diablo
[0:56:46] <heart_ablaze> cahthulu?
[0:56:47] <%logoth_> The misery reminds me of the Legacy of Kain
[0:56:48] <%Zutrax> Fair enough
[0:56:48] <%chronotriggerhappy123> stay awhile and listen
[0:56:48] <Thirtine> its religious nudity though
[0:56:49] <+superkeaton> It's the spanish guitar

[0:56:50] <evbites> ElenaManetta: asura's wrath?
[0:56:54] <alexandrecau> die woman
[0:56:57] <Louie_Salmon> @zutrax The only care when it's specifically sexual, like anime porn games
[0:57:00] <%moogleboy1984> Executions give you bonus Tears
[0:57:00] <Crushter> @elenamanetta I dunno, seven hundred arm elephant men with various weapons in hand that unmake you is metal
[0:57:02] <+Grayhammatter> oh
[0:57:02] <moragtang> First thing you fight is a boss.
[0:57:04] <%chronotriggerhappy123> oh boy this enemy
[0:57:04] <%floralkami> @zutrax if it's part of the game, it's okay.
[0:57:05] <+zzNamttamzz> so is this 2d Sekiro?
[0:57:06] <%FrostMass22> @bapposama the first enemy was a boss
[0:57:06] <%starotter70> @KoyaMusa Wait, no, really? NotLikeThis

[0:59:45] <sonofthedeepsouth> Are we collecting jojo corpse parts?
[0:59:46] <%dukenux> THE BABY
[0:59:47] <Parapattern> Vibe Check for your family
[0:59:49] <Louie_Salmon> These one-sentence stories are pretty good
[0:59:50] <$Sphincter_Spelunker> trio trio trio
[0:59:52] <%starotter70> Nice
[0:59:52] <%moogleboy1984> 36 more until you get the longest name of a thing I've seen in ages
[0:59:52] <%logoth_> Mega Man spikes
[0:59:53] <%Zutrax> The biggest flaws in this game are the spikes and the extremely aggressive ledge grabbing, if those both get patched some day then the game will be pretty damn amazing.
[0:59:54] <JayEarly> it’s hard to get the execution on those statue ladies but it’s brutal as fuck
[0:59:54] <%happyface699> Family family family.......
[0:59:56] <Clyderso> Is the blasphemous guy on his quest because all of these mobbers have wifi?
[0:59:59] <+SolverCODO> Hey wait, that enemy is just Dugtrio
[1:00:04] <+RiceeFTW> SHINE STALL
[1:00:05] <mostundesired> That's a Link down air
[1:00:06] <%bevyrage> looks like that plummet attack hits twice if they're tall enough
[1:00:07] <Crushter> @ner234 such is the wisdom of the Miracle
[1:00:10] <krlos970> Some of the bones are easter eggs
[1:00:10] <krymzen5> LUL
[1:00:11] <%Soul_Intern> YEAH
[1:00:16] <%Shadicara> a that's a pointy helmet you have there pat Kappa
[1:00:22] <Coystick> The Blip Bloop sound effects remind me of old Sega RPGs like Light Crusader
[1:00:25] <StonerStan101> So the bible, but if written by a Metal Band?
[1:00:28] <+arfsm95> @AngriestPat there's one you didn't kill
[1:00:28] <cureneckbeard> does your guy have a pointy head
[1:00:31] <antthefool> @clyderso on his journey to purge red bar warriors
[1:00:31] <+RayDaug> I feel like this game is Catholic Mortal Kombat
[1:00:33] <%logoth_> Is this on the switch?
[1:00:33] <Thirtine> StinkyCheese
[1:00:37] <%StaceMcGate> crunch
[1:00:38] <thelonechris> CHEEVO
[1:00:40] <moragtang> @AngriestPat By the way, if you hold down while attacking in the air you get a bit of momentum that makes you float, you can do it twice before falling. This is never mentioned in the game.
[1:00:41] <mostundesired> Achiebement
[1:00:41] <%ScreamLord> Brutal
[1:00:41] <%bevyrage> i wonder, does the charge attack go through shields?
[1:00:42] <%moogleboy1984> Expect everything to be oppresively Spanish Catholic named
[1:00:45] <Ner234> @Crushter The Miracle sounds like a jerk LUL
[1:00:45] <LaughingCatt> squish
[1:00:46] <+Reizie_Etherealm> That hat might as well have the word "dunce" on it

[1:01:01] <%RubberFistFight> @AngriestPat you want to make that jump. It's worth it.
[1:01:01] <lexiliat_33> there is a check point close

[1:01:02] <%ElenaManetta> sNOW?
[1:01:04] <metrying> pretty
[1:01:04] <%dukenux> the bone parts are a reference to reliquaries, where in many cases contain small fragments of some Saint's bones(or alleged fragments)

[1:01:09] <%Ynkubus18> More like catholic myhtos that metal bands typically draw from
[1:01:10] <%ElenaManetta> how is it snowing in one screen but not the other
[1:01:12] <%griffball13> @AngriestPat that is where the missible side quest is

[1:02:03] <Rayorin> So it opens up the parry window?
[1:02:03] <jerobees> Boosts the Blocking SUTANDO
[1:02:04] <pmtriox> blasphe-boy
[1:02:09] <%RubberFistFight> @AngriestPat widens your parry window, but leaves you a tiny little more open. It's absolutely worth the tradeoff imho, I didn't notice any difference to my "vulnerability"
[1:02:10] <%Shadicara> So is pat gonna be Catholic by the end of this game?
[1:02:11] <Crushter> you can only equip them at bonfires @angriestpat

[1:02:19] <%chronotriggerhappy123> go back to Where The Olive Trees Wither and talk to a metal af dude
[1:02:23] <Mendin> Bigger parry window and a few frames open afterwards

[1:02:59] <%ScreamLord> @AngriestPat This looks like if Metalocalypse was a 16 bit game
[1:02:59] <lethallylactic> Let him find stuff himself.
[1:03:00] <%logoth_> There shouldnt be any women at all in this world, just children and men
[1:03:04] <pmtriox> nay i say

[1:03:10] <%Mr_Strut> So this is Castlevania: Coneheads Edition?
[1:03:10] <%dukenux> Let him explore in peace
[1:03:12] <%fatally_furious> you enjoying Woolie's nightmare, @angriestpat

[1:03:20] <%floralkami> @logoth_ the fuck?
[1:03:21] <%moogleboy1984> yeah it's like 45 minutes from game start
[1:03:24] <%ElenaManetta> What timer
[1:03:24] <moragtang> Yes this is Catlevania: Cvstodia of Sin
[1:03:25] <%Soul_Intern> @logoth_ Now you're sounding like atrue catholic!

[1:03:51] <%StaceMcGate> So Dead Cells but with Catholic guilt?
[1:03:51] <Thirtine> cant miss the guy once youre here
[1:03:52] <%RubberFistFight> @moogleboy1984 no it's not. It only counts from when you start talking to him, and the "advance" triggers are boss kills.
[1:03:52] <Ultimatefool> YO THIS AREA LOOKS SO GOOD
[1:03:56] <%Shadicara> That's just a bonfire LUL
[1:03:57] <%moogleboy1984> Gemino's quest to set him on fire with Olive Oil
[1:03:59] <%floralkami> @logoth_ I knew it sounded familiar, but it's just soooo wrong
[1:04:00] <$Sphincter_Spelunker> that's what she said
[1:04:03] <mostundesired> That's waht she said
[1:04:11] <+TheImmortal70> Tree guy up here is only alive until you either kill a boss, or 45 minutes~ after you talk to him
[1:04:12] <Coystick> Ooooh

[1:04:19] <%chronotriggerhappy123> there he is
[1:04:21] <Doodle_Taco> Poem to Canada
[1:04:21] <Eirykr> Collecting the bones of dead guys is pretty metal
[1:04:22] <+Grayhammatter> oh
[1:04:22] <%starotter70> Ok then
[1:04:24] <%mh9s> fuckin ykies
[1:04:24] <lexiliat_33> you still can get the reward from that misssion later, even if you fail. It feels bad tough
[1:04:25] <+superkeaton> Oh okay rooBlank
[1:04:25] <%Soul_Intern> OK
[1:04:26] <Coystick> I missed it then

[1:04:32] <%Tredecian> this guys doing ok
[1:04:32] <%Dr_Mooose> oh wow
[1:04:33] <Crushter> @theimmortal70 it's only from boss kills
[1:04:34] <%Diabetic> This is like if Catholics had the bible but NOTHING good ever happened
[1:04:34] <%Solidnick18> Tree lord
[1:04:34] <StonerStan101> That is fucking Metal dude.
[1:04:35] <%Mr_Strut> Well that looks fucking evil
[1:04:35] <+BruceyG> Fucking sick
[1:04:35] <%Calek> never talked to this guy
[1:04:36] <sonofthedeepsouth> Nice
[1:04:38] <krymzen5> hes fine
[1:04:39] <%dukenux> hi Gemino
[1:04:39] <%RubberFistFight> Nice job guys, he's likely to miss it now.
[1:04:42] <Cobaltor_252> you should give him a hand, he looks stuck @AngriestPat
[1:04:42] <metrying> LOOK AT THAT GOD OF WAR
[1:04:43] <%stemlo_> Yo
[1:04:46] <+CourageTheCat> jeez
[1:04:49] <+TheImmortal70> Oh thank god, because that's awful otherwise given this area

[1:04:54] <+RiceeFTW> THAT'S RAD
[1:04:55] <%dukenux> wait, Gemino... is he stuck in the corpse of his twin?
[1:04:56] <Coystick> HE'S FIIIIIINE
[1:04:57] <alexandrecau> how many in that thing???!!
[1:04:58] <roofkie> jesus fuck what is this
[1:04:59] <Rayorin> This whole game is one huge metal album cover
[1:05:03] <moragtang> @Diabetic This is more like if God actually punished catholics for all the bad shit they did in "his name".
[1:05:03] <$Sphincter_Spelunker> multiple deaths
[1:05:08] <worldbrand> wait are they inside a statue??
[1:05:08] <%ElenaManetta> Living tombs are rad
[1:05:10] <%moogleboy1984> also, more Dong for you all
[1:05:17] <Parapattern> That's fucking mutant Saint Sebastian
[1:05:18] <%Diabetic> @moragtang sounds right
[1:05:18] <evbites> fuck......
[1:05:20] <%theshillman> p0n0s
[1:05:22] <%griffball13> @AngriestPat if you wait to long for the guy he dies
[1:05:22] <Coystick> think about his anatomy for a second...
[1:05:23] <%ElenaManetta> It's such a horrifying death, not being able to even budge
[1:05:24] <mostundesired> Oh, it's Prometheus.
[1:05:25] <ObsidianDragon86> Is that a dude inside another dude!??!?!?
[1:05:25] <%Zaphire_Saucypants> daaaamn....encased in an iron statue in the dead of winter.
[1:05:30] <eiightbiitt> is this game any good? I was looking at it on switch.
[1:05:35] <pmtriox> a freezing cold cast iron statue
[1:05:36] <%floralkami> yes guys, this dude is incased in metal
[1:05:39] <Coystick> Opposite of the brazen bull
[1:05:40] <krymzen5> to get the oil
[1:05:41] <%chronotriggerhappy123> both
[1:05:41] <$realm_forge> Shit that makes Igarashi go “Holy Shit!”
[1:05:42] <alexandrecau> it's not one guy they stuffed like nine guys in it
[1:05:43] <Mendin> Yes
[1:05:45] <Thirtine> to get the item
[1:05:45] <%dukenux> oh shit
[1:05:46] <Louie_Salmon> Yes
[1:05:48] <JayEarly> @moogleboy1984 for some reason I totally missed all the dongs while playing
[1:05:50] <%FrostMass22> Entering the area does it
[1:05:50] <lexiliat_33> to get the oil
[1:05:50] <+luftraumm1> talk
[1:05:51] <$drfaustisdead> @AngriestPat too long to get the oil.
[1:05:52] <+Kingjhon8> "Take this"
[1:05:53] <roofkie> so is this like castlevania?
[1:05:55] <AnacondaVirtue> Get the oil, quickly
[1:05:57] <Louie_Salmon> To get the oil I believe
[1:05:59] <%moogleboy1984> @eiightbiitt it's good, but there are a few wonky hitboxes and some really awkward bugs
[1:06:01] <%crimsonharvest> fucker took an arrow to the knee
[1:06:02] <Crushter> @angriestpat they got in them willingly, you just have to do this zone first now
[1:06:03] <%Shadicara> On the timer now pat
[1:06:04] <%ElenaManetta> Aw I dont like this game being timed, I want Pat to explore
[1:06:05] <%FrostMass22> @eiightbiitt It's not Hollow Knight but it's good
[1:06:06] <%starotter70> ooooooh
[1:06:06] <moragtang> Ehh don't worry about it too hard.
[1:06:07] <Jetsfantasy> Keep going and you should find it as you clear the area. I got it without even knowing about the timer
[1:06:08] <%logoth_> he's awfully calm for being nailed to a tree
[1:06:09] <Coystick> Go go go go
[1:06:15] <+luftraumm1> having the thimble ensures the next part of the quest iirc
[1:06:16] <%moogleboy1984> @JayEarly I have Dong Sense
[1:06:20] <%floralkami> too long to talk
[1:06:22] <juxtest> Freeze the gold
[1:06:23] <+Hoonbaba_Woods> poor bastard took an arrow to the knee
[1:06:24] <Coystick> No lore only oil
[1:06:25] <lethallylactic> This is kind of a stupid quest honestly, especially when nothing else is timed and there's no NG+.
[1:06:27] <Eirykr> He's probably resigned to it at this point
[1:06:28] <%griffball13> @AngriestPat i think it's boss based you need to kill this places boss to get the oil and if you kill other bosses it's to late because after 2 bosses he dies
[1:06:32] <%StaceMcGate> does pause menu count as timer?
[1:06:32] <Thirtine> ehh, you dont really have to look for the oil, youll get it as you clear the area
[1:06:34] <LandOfTheWay> time to oil up
[1:06:38] <eiightbiitt> sweet is this like Dead Cells?
[1:06:39] <%MakotoPB> can the in game talking volume be increased? trying to watch in background but having to read subtitles is hard
[1:06:39] <%fatally_furious> @eiightbiitt out of the thousand castlevanias your seeing the good 1%
[1:06:39] <T_Sasquatch> wtf
[1:06:39] <+Grayhammatter> yikes

[1:07:27] <%Solidnick18> that's good
[1:07:28] <%RubberFistFight> @moragtang yeah - you get one boss kill after talking to him before the quest advances past the point where you can finish it "properly"
[1:07:28] <+TheWe4pon> Dude it's Dugtrio
[1:07:29] <%logoth_> I might have to buy this
[1:07:29] <pmtriox> get scared

[1:07:37] <%Shadicara> Garlock
[1:07:41] <Coystick> It's the exact feeling of playing a souls game blind
[1:07:43] <Ravingpyro> this game looks really good
[1:07:46] <JayEarly> i like everyone exploding into guts
[1:07:47] <Thirtine> sandalwood garlic?
[1:07:49] <%mh9s> delicious
[1:07:52] <$Sphincter_Spelunker> Enchantment
[1:07:54] <%Mr_Strut> Garlic does NOT smell like sandalwood
[1:07:54] <%dukenux> You have garlic and oil, you can make some Aioli PogChamp
[1:07:57] <Mister_McDerp> for killing dracula
[1:07:57] <moragtang> @RubberFistFight Yeah I killed the one boss and came back. So I guess he for real just perishes if you kill another one?
[1:07:57] <eiightbiitt> is it a general path game or kinda like Dead Cells?
[1:07:59] <%floralkami> IT SHOULD BE
[1:08:00] <FrankysDream> ointment ingredient probably
[1:08:00] <%fatally_furious> dedicated Lore button
[1:08:04] <+JustToWatch> can you check your map
[1:08:07] <+imadoc91> Oh this is that souls platformer where the only hat is the one that Alfred wore in bloodborne?
[1:08:08] <+imadoc91> Fun
[1:08:08] <Eirykr> Now you just need some pasta sauce
[1:08:08] <+TheImmortal70> FUCK I never read these
[1:08:11] <%RubberFistFight> @moragtang so now pat basically has to complete 2 areas that are frustratingly hard, as well as a boss that is "meant" to be done second, all because chat don't know wtf they're on about as per usual.

[1:09:48] <+RiceeFTW> that's the GIT GUD tutorial
[1:09:48] <%Calek> I like how the death tutorial message just assumes you'll die to the first enemy

[1:09:58] <+gralho> you dont lose the tears on death bit you earn less
[1:10:01] <BallisticMeerkat> @AngriestPat you dont lose money, you lose MP
[1:10:01] <%RubberFistFight> @AngriestPat lol it gave you that way out of sequence, it was meant to tell you about the bloodstain equivalent LUL good bad bugs, I guess.
[1:10:02] <%Zutrax> you just gain less XP/money as you die

[1:10:25] <3xgilly> magic
[1:10:29] <%moogleboy1984> and makes you earn less Tears

[1:10:30] <%GIGA255> fervor bar... sounds like a delicious candy
[1:10:35] <%dalmek> dying means you have less
[1:10:35] <+superkeaton> A portion is locked

[1:10:44] <mostundesired> ????
[1:10:45] <+gralho> and you earn less souls
[1:10:46] <Mendin> Hollow Knight-esque but without the money loss
[1:10:46] <+Infernal_Dalek> It also gimps your income
[1:10:49] <riotshark> you also earn less money
[1:10:50] <%dalmek> you also get less money
[1:10:52] <Mister_McDerp> a catholic's power is proportionate to their guilt
[1:10:53] <%Zutrax> @AngriestPat Death makes the MP bar covered a bit, but you also slowly fill that icon on the top right and dont gain as much money.xp
[1:10:54] <mrlastchance1> So is church bad in this game>
[1:10:55] <%Bt_Robot> More if you were in any way different or better than those around you, especially if you were from the lower classes, you were considered having consorted with the devil in order to get these advantages.
[1:10:57] <Louie_Salmon> DS2, but Mana instead of health, and you earn less XP
[1:11:03] <+RiceeFTW> the GUILT OF FAILURE
[1:11:04] <Coystick> On your souls icon too, LESS souls per kill
[1:11:05] <%floralkami> hit the guys in the praying cages
[1:11:06] <Dingo_Eejit> @GIGA255 - It does!
[1:11:16] <%Shadicara> No church is always good never question the crusade Kappa
[1:11:21] <%Teyaric> Huh, it comes with a heal, too.
[1:11:21] <ivansonic08> You hit one hanged and Gut's falls out
[1:11:33] <mostundesired> Just smash it right into your face.
[1:11:39] <Mendin> Considering the Divine Will is Real and Can Curse You With Guilty Punishment I'd probabyl go to church
[1:11:42] <%thegreenbenis> Crusade was self defense.
[1:11:47] <mostundesired> Is THAT Jesus?
[1:11:56] <%floralkami> @mrlastchance1 *shrug* I think the message is every church considered every other church Blasphemous.
[1:11:58] <%Teyaric> The order we've seen so far seems mostly like a Response Unit to the Greivous Miracle. The church is probably fucky, but given that Shit is Happening
[1:12:01] <mostundesired> DUDE LIT HIMSELF ON FIRE
[1:12:02] <lexiliat_33> you can hit the bottle
[1:12:04] <%Bt_Robot> At this time, people were considered to be worms before God, and their duty was to suffer as much as possible in life in order to earn their way into heaven.
[1:12:05] <StonerStan101> So we have a Metal Catholic game.
[1:12:09] <Coystick> Tree man is gonna die never knowing the sweet touch of olive oil

[1:12:58] <jerobees> Yo
[1:13:01] <%griffball13> @AngriestPat just so you know there is no fall damage except for bottomless pits
[1:13:04] <%moogleboy1984> these fuckers have awful hitboxes
[1:13:05] <%dukenux> you see the shit those guys pull on the Phillipines?

[1:13:19] <%thegreenbenis> That's scary
[1:13:19] <dynam0jones> is this a dark soul?
[1:13:23] <%starotter70> @dukenux ?
[1:13:24] <%fatally_furious> @eiightbiitt i'd imagine so since there isnt a 3d asset to be seen
[1:13:25] <%RubberFistFight> @eiightbiitt it runs magnificently on the switch. I bought it on that and i don't regret it.

[1:13:49] <krymzen5> this areas the hardest of the starting zones
[1:13:53] <%Jrocy247> I mean I guess, but it's just not very likable to me, but that's just me of course
[1:13:53] <+SolverCODO> that's just the berserk mark

[1:13:55] <%starotter70> oh
[1:13:56] <%Calek> I'm convinced those ghost bell enemies are glitched because it sounds like they're spawning in for much longer than they actually do and are invincible until the sound stops

[1:13:57] <majindusto> Oh yeah...FUCK YOU PAT, MEGAMAN LEGENDS 2 IS GREAT!!!
[1:13:58] <%RubberFistFight> @AngriestPat so uh... you now HAVE to beat this area and the boss of it to properly advance that tree guy quest. So have fun with that. Kappa
[1:13:59] <%ItsRatman> this is some heavy religious terminology here
[1:14:00] <MasterGeneralVic> Wow the art style of this game reminds me of dead cells alot. Very diffrent and almost Depressing tone. And of course mind goblins will plague this stream. love your streams and vods
[1:14:01] <JayEarly> @jrocy247 it’s based on a capirote, a hat worn by Spanish Catholics
[1:14:02] <%Bt_Robot> Now atone for the sin of your death.
[1:14:03] <%Big_Dream> @AngriestPat gi buy the move
[1:14:04] <%jeffishype> @AngriestPat Hold off on picking those up right away in boss fights, the fragments heal you
[1:14:11] <%moogleboy1984> and this isn't even the Blighttown of the game

[1:14:34] <%thegreenbenis> DEUS VULT
[1:14:34] <%RubberFistFight> @moogleboy1984 no - this is the catacombs, only it goes up instead of down.
[1:14:38] <Coystick> Thinking bout olive oil
[1:14:49] <%Big_Dream> i cant be catholic i am not into kids
[1:14:49] <krymzen5> no need to upgrade, u don't drop souls
[1:14:57] <%Zutrax> There's a shop, the items you can buy are way more important than the sword upgrades
[1:15:01] <%Zutrax> save up for it
[1:15:07] <+RiceeFTW> @Jrocy247 considering the main character is in "penance" they have to atone, and so they wear those pointed hoods

[1:15:50] <Doodle_Taco> Very graphic
[1:15:52] <%JonaFett69> just like the crusades bby
[1:15:54] <%ElenaManetta> you started the game pouring a helmet of blood over your head

[1:15:59] <Ominnous> naw it's cool, you're violent for Jesus
[1:15:59] <BallisticMeerkat> it's gone till you pick them up, or by another means later
[1:15:59] <+nekodelic> it's not permanently gone
[1:16:00] <%griffball13> @AngriestPat if you look on your map is shows whrer guilt fragments are
[1:16:02] <%fatally_furious> @jrocy247 fast, to stab anyone hiding there
[1:16:02] <+luftraumm1> @angriestpat you're ok on the thimble quest

[1:16:12] <%Bt_Robot> Pat has been found guilty of the sin of Greed.

[1:16:15] <%RubberFistFight> @Mister_McDerp well I mean there was that one time he hulked out in the temple and kicked over all the tables and beat up all the loan sharks.
[1:16:16] <%moogleboy1984> when you get to the real Castlevania area, you'll have a LOT of Guilt Ghost babies
[1:16:20] <+RiceeFTW> RIP AND TEAR until PENANCE IS COMPLETE
[1:16:22] <+Jaysky> That was vewy viowent (・`ω´・) We shouwd stop pwaying this game nyow - fow the kids!
[1:16:28] <mostundesired> HUGE GUTYS
[1:16:34] <%saint__dementia> the amount of violence is VERY high
[1:16:35] <moragtang> @AngriestPat You don't have just one "bloodstain". There can be many bloodstains left in the map, they show on the minimap too.
[1:16:37] <JayEarly> the most violent one I’ve seen is on those ladies with the statues,
[1:16:37] <Jetsfantasy> She DUNKS
[1:16:41] <Notsocleveruser> He's wavedashing

[1:16:58] <Mister_McDerp> @RubberFistFight It's was the right thing to do
[1:17:02] <%Solidnick18> what
[1:17:09] <+Jaysky> Is there any sort of fall damage in this?
[1:17:14] <%saint__dementia> saint__dementia subscribed with Twitch Prime. They've subscribed for 2 months! Seymour butts
[1:17:15] <moragtang> Nah.
[1:17:15] <+arfsm95> @AngriestPat the guy casted in iron in the tree is an allegory to saint sebastian
[1:17:18] <%moogleboy1984> excellent
[1:17:22] <Clyderso> Pog
[1:17:25] <+RiceeFTW> I don't think there's fall damage
[1:17:30] <moragtang> Only deadly falls are pits and spikes.
[1:17:31] <%RubberFistFight> @Mister_McDerp yeah it was. It's just notable as one of the few occasions Jesus dropped the "turn the other cheek" act and went full-on rampage mode.
[1:17:32] <+RiceeFTW> unless it's a death pit
[1:17:33] <%StaceMcGate> MOrTIS

[1:17:57] <lexiliat_33> there is no fall damage, but if you fall over an enemy you hurt it, even if you dont attack
[1:17:57] <JayEarly> SHWACKED
[1:17:57] <%KoyaMusa> BYE GEMINO
[1:17:57] <%Zero_Awakening> maybe the other way
[1:18:00] <%Engwithan_Elder_God> Time to BACK DOWN
[1:18:00] <+Grayhammatter> guess olive oil guy won't be getting that oil
[1:18:00] <%MakotoPB> pat refusing to heal is making my brain hurt
[1:18:01] <krymzen5> that rooms mean

[1:18:03] <%Yadogari> F
[1:18:04] <%Bt_Robot> Pat has been found guilty of the sin Sloth.
[1:18:05] <Mister_McDerp> BIG back down
[1:18:08] <%Jrocy247> So, Is this game another one of those "It's Dark Souls but it's 2D" or just a metrovania Stroller?
[1:18:11] <%Teyaric> Leaving the nPC to die, Pat?
[1:18:14] <%InugamiTheHound> got go to bed, sorry @AngriestPat
[1:18:15] <not_twitter_rowan> Pat that was a challenge room not progression
[1:18:17] <%Shadicara> That guy will never get his oil
[1:18:23] <StarsCrusader> Don't let Gemino die, dude ;u;
[1:18:24] <%Zutrax> Pat the room you were beating your head against just has an item, you should keep progressing in the snow area.
[1:18:25] <+csisson147> @angriestpat you’re technically trying to do the second level first, that’s why it’s so hard
[1:18:27] <+nekodelic> @jrocy247 yes, but more catholic
[1:18:28] <%Yadogari> You only had 10% HP
[1:18:29] <%moogleboy1984> there's little opportunity to in that room
[1:18:31] <moragtang> You have to make time to heal also. There's a long animation.
[1:18:37] <Crushter> this is the hardest area
[1:18:38] <+RiceeFTW> there's a very long recovery time on the heals
[1:18:42] <%Teyaric> You have 4 HP. Sometimes attacks don't do a full one.
[1:18:43] <Crushter> starting wise
[1:18:44] <%Jrocy247> @nekodelic Yes as in what sir?
[1:18:46] <T_Sasquatch> how i feel about nioh
[1:18:47] <%KoyaMusa> welp gemino is gonna die
[1:18:49] <%firehawk_420> @angriestpat try charge swing on a shield dude
[1:18:49] <%RubberFistFight> @AngriestPat if you want to preserve the tree guy's quest, you can go all the way up to the zone boss of this area, grab all the upgrades and shit, and then go back and do snowy area. I kinda wish chat hadn't misinformed you on how the timer works, but oh well.
[1:18:50] <%Tredecian> healing occurs at the button press then animation fyi
[1:18:53] <krymzen5> snow areas the hadest for many reasons
[1:18:53] <alexandrecau> everything hurt like hell pat it'S called BLASPHEMous
[1:19:03] <Crushter> @koyamusa only if he beats two bosses
[1:19:04] <Louie_Salmon> @zutrax but now his bloodstain is there, so he has to do it
[1:19:13] <%Shadicara> religion hurts pat
[1:19:17] <viciousgrim> @AngriestPat that is because you are guilty BibleThump
[1:19:27] <mostundesired> The lord works in mysterious ways.
[1:19:28] <lexiliat_33> both ways lead back
[1:19:29] <Tony0ni> what are you doing
[1:19:38] <%RubberFistFight> @Louie_Salmon nah there's something else he can do.
[1:19:44] <ObsidianDragon86> That will never not be fun to watch
[1:20:00] <%marsano168> Chat is filled with mega Anxiety tonight look like
[1:20:03] <Louie_Salmon> @rubberfistfight Yeah but he doesn't have it now, and he would be earning less tears now
[1:20:08] <%firehawk_420> Those executions are NASTY
[1:20:12] <%Teyaric> The saint on their shield is headless. And you kill them with a decap. I wonder if that's respectful, or ironic?
[1:20:14] <$Sphincter_Spelunker> do we get see a crazed zealot? I wanna hear some maniac quoting the bible and styling on me. I want Vergil to read the bible at me, pretty much
[1:20:26] <%FrostMass22> Why is Pat not doing the area he is now locked into finishing?
[1:20:27] <%jobbedbone> Wheres the crushing guilt
[1:20:28] <alwayspronking> power attack?
[1:20:28] <%Typhaeon> Get lucky basically
[1:20:34] <%logoth_> use the shift
[1:20:35] <%jobbedbone> I was promised crushing guilt
[1:20:35] <StonerStan101> Albertoe.
[1:20:37] <Crushter> luck
[1:20:39] <%StaceMcGate> Alberta is a hellhole
[1:20:40] <Roach3s> pretty similar to alberta tbh
[1:20:45] <%griffball13> @AngriestPat in my expierience a thrust attack usally stuns her
[1:20:45] <%RubberFistFight> @Louie_Salmon sure, but chat fucked him on insisting he go there first because a few people had no idea how the tree guy timer worked, and they just happened to scream the loudest/most insistently, so here we are.
[1:20:47] <%moogleboy1984> I think the best part of this game is that saying the item names gives no hint as to what they do
[1:20:47] <%Zero_Awakening> you have garlic for the kissers
[1:20:50] <FrankysDream> check on the skeleton!
[1:20:53] <Thirtine> too many rats to be alberta LUL
[1:20:55] <%1matheuw> @Sphincter_Spelunker weird fetish but im not gonna kink shame you
[1:21:05] <%Shadicara> Cleanse the people pat Kappa
[1:21:11] <%Zutrax> just an FYI you don't get anything for placing those in this room until you have like nearly all of them
[1:21:16] <%dukenux> Alfredo
[1:21:16] <%Zutrax> so going back isn't super important
[1:21:28] <$Sphincter_Spelunker> @1matheuw V awoke it in me
[1:21:30] <%RubberFistFight> @Zutrax it's cool though, it goes CLICK CLICK CLICK and the bones appear. so there's that.
[1:21:30] <%fatally_furious> @1matheuw i'd imagine Woolie would want Vergil to spit bible verses at him too Kappa

[1:30:07] <AxelCezar> now THAT is some good quality game projLOVE projLOVE
[1:30:08] <%Teyaric> The only downside is it's on old Megaman rules for it's platforming. And it's like 3/7th of the game.

[1:30:31] <%RubberFistFight> @Marpolo13 there's a fatal gamebreaking bug that necessitates that as a precaution, unfortunately.
[1:30:34] <%ShovelJustice21> @AngriestPat Have you played death's gambit?
[1:30:36] <+Walopoh> It only gets cooler dont you worry @AngriestPat
[1:30:37] <%PaladinDupre> Can i get it on Switch?

[1:30:54] <Marpolo13> @RubberFistFight i didn't mean it, but good to know regardless
[1:30:57] <moragtang> Death's Gambit is very janky, but it's also pretty neat.
[1:30:57] <%griffball13> 25 us dollars
[1:30:58] <%ArcanumMBD> Death's Gambit is super janky, but it's still pretty cool
[1:31:00] <$SvenHolgersson> A million dollars
[1:31:05] <%KoyaMusa> he wasn't given a free code to death's gambit, so he can't influencer it
[1:31:05] <lethallylactic> Death's Gambit has a big update in the works anyway.
[1:31:06] <%PaladinDupre> I'm in sales, cost isnt the issue
[1:31:09] <AxelCezar> deaths gambit has death on an apron... projLOL

[1:32:50] <%RubberFistFight> @AngriestPat yes, because technically this is the catacombs area.
[1:32:55] <+arfsm95> @AngriestPat pat i have a legit question about your mind goblins
[1:32:55] <%sirisvirus> mountain is definatly the hardest path early game
[1:32:59] <Louie_Salmon> @rubberfistfight Man that's such a blunt way to put it but yeah
[1:33:07] <%Laecerelius> Also try to hit the worm people only twice since you don't have enough time to three hit and dodge and you have ot hit them again anyway
[1:33:09] <%jobbedbone> I hate bars
[1:33:13] <+PukingGoombas> I saw Pat finally beat Astral Chain. Was the ending dope?
[1:33:18] <JackKrauser> This is the adventures of Pyramid Head before James fucked it all up for him.
[1:33:20] <Prism_Wing> oh nvm i see it now
[1:33:22] <Acti0njacks0n99> how does he get the executions so consistently?
[1:33:32] <Louie_Salmon> @pukinggoombas It's Platinum, of course it was dope
[1:33:32] <%RubberFistFight> @Louie_Salmon the bit about the catacombs? or the bit about inexperience caused deaths?
[1:33:32] <+Walopoh> nice
[1:33:35] <moragtang> I'd say this is more like going to Depths and Blighttown before the Gargoyles.

[1:34:20] <Louie_Salmon> @rubberfistfight Inexperience caused deaths, like that's what takes up time in a lot of games but that's the bluntest way to say it
[1:34:24] <%moogleboy1984> @TheBitingIrish you can hold down while hitting an enemy while airborn to bounce up a little bit
[1:34:26] <dmtjinni> Pat is BIG mad
[1:34:26] <+csisson147> @coystick you’re demented
[1:34:28] <lethallylactic> First rank charge attack is pretty bad.
[1:34:31] <Coystick> true

[1:34:33] <LodiFrostbeard> doing this zone with only 2 flasks is fucked
[1:34:33] <not_twitter_rowan> Pat where you keep dying is a challenge room not progression, feel free to coward out
[1:34:34] <+arfsm95> @AngriestPat pat i have a legit question about your mind goblins, if you don't use consumables in a boss because if you die it's wasted, then isn't the item wasted anyway because it's never used?
[1:34:35] <%Zaphire_Saucypants> hm...it'd probably be better to focus on the guy that takes three hits to die first
[1:34:40] <%floralkami> oh shit, it DRINKS the oil
[1:34:43] <%Teyaric> There's a little flashing glyph on his eye when he uses the estus

[1:56:15] <%miguelrod777> space is convluted here
[1:56:18] <%FrostMass22> @zutrax There's no point in getting rid of them at the start of the game.

[1:57:10] <Coystick> No Attack the Stat
[1:57:11] <moragtang> Nah, it's fine. It's a Dark Souls pardoner.
[1:57:12] <lexiliat_33> no
[1:57:12] <%dukenux> @LodiFrostbeard do not tempt me LUL
[1:57:12] <Mendin> Just costs money

[1:57:15] <%shurtal> Risen in thy name
[1:57:20] <%moogleboy1984> @AngriestPat it only dies if you break it
[1:57:20] <TomDanksEGOT> it costs $$
[1:57:21] <%Dakuu75> what's the point of that MP bar?
[1:57:21] <%floralkami> No
[1:57:22] <%Zutrax> You can use it as much as you want, BUT you can destroy it for a questline
[1:57:23] <%hntronium> Only on the way up?
[1:57:25] <@commanderclaw> Costs 400 tears
[1:57:26] <%sirisvirus> you can destroy the statues
[1:57:28] <%floralkami> It costs tears
[1:57:34] <%FrostMass22> The statue is always there until you break
[1:57:35] <b_ikki> not a fixed price
[1:57:44] <lexiliat_33> don't break them though
[1:57:48] <%miguelrod777> dont
[1:57:49] <lexiliat_33> yet
[1:57:50] <+Roundelay11> DUNNO LOL
[1:57:50] <LodiFrostbeard> @commanderclaw cost depends on how guilty you are
[1:57:51] <Mister_McDerp> iconoclasm
[1:57:53] <%Calek> @Dakuu75 to cast spells
[1:57:54] <Aliensigma> It's not a pardoner, it retrieves your souls for a fee
[1:57:55] <moragtang> Why would you EVER break such a nice and useful statue, though?
[1:57:56] <%Big_King_Coconut> break everything
[1:57:57] <+TheImmortal70> It's a mystery

[2:01:18] <asurite_warrior> just take a little nap
[2:01:19] <LodiFrostbeard> the guy who designed the wind in this area can go FUCK HIMSELF
[2:01:23] <Ominnous> look at those anime tears
[2:01:27] <DJMesoPhunk> the hat is a Capriote, it was used in Spanish Catholicism originally for people being led to their execution and later adopted by those in penance
[2:01:31] <%RubberFistFight> Welcome to The. Most. Goddamn. INFURIATING. mechanic in the game up until this point.

[2:01:55] <%StaceMcGate> I feel a MORTIS coming
[2:01:56] <%RubberFistFight> @b_ikki no, it's not. It's worse.
[2:01:57] <%fatally_furious> this game is a god damn fresco
[2:02:00] <$Sphincter_Spelunker> everest? I meant rushmore
[2:02:04] <+Reizie_Etherealm> Holy crap, that wind is ridiculous
[2:02:04] <%moogleboy1984> I still think the auto ledge grab is worse
[2:02:10] <%Teyaric> so its like, he's a standard penitent one, save the steel of it, and the sword?
[2:02:12] <Coystick> I was on board with his hat from day one of the kickstarter pitch, capirotes are the shit
[2:02:15] <%Solidnick18> ok
[2:02:15] <%arcaderabbit48> @Dakuu75 No, but next stream will probably see him finish it
[2:02:19] <atravelbee> MOUTH NOISES
[2:02:20] <%RubberFistFight> [Audible panic intensifies]
[2:02:21] <+Binary_Fireball> i've seen people get stuck in this part for a while

[2:02:27] <+luftraumm1> *mouth noises*
[2:02:27] <%grayjammer> "Holy Shit" is an apt descriptor for this game
[2:02:28] <+RiceeFTW> D:
[2:02:29] <SlimeSlimeSlime> So this is like Dark Souls X Castlevania?
[2:02:29] <Crushter> the auto grab is more useful than harmful
[2:02:30] <rottingcrawler> Oh nice, i caught playing a metal album.

[2:03:57] <%RubberFistFight> @Binary_Fireball it's so bad. You have to be near-perfect with your jumps, and the platform collision/clipping on the disappearing platforms is not great.

[2:07:17] <%moogleboy1984> it, along with the rosary knot, needs something else
[2:07:18] <Crushter> you fill them at places
[2:07:19] <Mendin> It's an estus flask shard and you havent seen the proper blacksmith
[2:07:20] <%Calek> you gotta find a thing
[2:07:21] <b_ikki> definitely not
[2:07:22] <DJMesoPhunk> you need to find something else to get your new vial

[2:08:02] <%Soul_Intern> @StaceMcGate NO
[2:08:04] <%FrostMass22> @rubberfistfight So what? doesn't that mean he'll need to kill charred lady early no matter what?
[2:08:09] <%Jrocy247> YES, keep attacking it's back. Surely it will work one day
[2:08:24] <%moogleboy1984> trade HP for MP
[2:08:25] <moragtang> Yeah, that's a hidden move.
[2:08:25] <Mister_McDerp> ?
[2:08:26] <Crushter> @frostmass22 only if he wants to perfect geminos quest

[2:08:42] <%Zero_Awakening> sacrifice blood for magic
[2:08:42] <Mendin> @AngriestPat It's a blood bullet that also costs 10 tears
[2:08:45] <%fatally_furious> sacrifice time on the clock for more power
[2:08:46] <TomDanksEGOT> sacrifice health for magic son
[2:08:47] <mostundesired> Do it again Kappa
[2:08:49] <Mister_McDerp> this is a soulsborne
[2:08:49] <%dukenux> OH no
[2:08:50] <b_ikki> takes your money too
[2:08:51] <moragtang> It also costs 10 Tears of Atonement.
[2:08:55] <$Sphincter_Spelunker> pro starts
[2:09:01] <Coystick> Sneaky
[2:09:01] <moragtang> Money go DOWN.
[2:09:01] <%floralkami> @FrostMass22 no, if you do another boss after the first, then you miss it.
[2:09:01] <$Sphincter_Spelunker> strats too
[2:09:05] <%dukenux> OH NO
[2:09:09] <lexiliat_33> just a bit
[2:09:10] <%RubberFistFight> @FrostMass22 if he'd gone down instead of up, Treebro would have been just fine whilst he was busy defeating the cistern, piedad and mercy dreams. I know that because I literally did it in that order a day ago. That would furnish him with the upgrades he needs to get through this area properly, kill charred lady, and go back to treebro with the oil.
[2:09:11] <%dukenux> this is red orb spending
[2:09:15] <%Jay_Squirrel> i was gone for a bit, did he talk to the creepy tree?
[2:09:18] <%StaceMcGate> crazy talk in 3, 2, 1
[2:09:40] <moragtang> He did.
[2:09:40] <Mendin> @RubberFistFight I did Pie Dad and stumbod around a bit doing side quests, came here as the second thing, and treebeard was fully petrified
[2:09:45] <%moogleboy1984> @RubberFistFight and you'd be wrong, because I came her second on my playthrough and Gemino was already a tree since you need to killa boss to get the Olive Oil
[2:09:48] <+Walopoh> Celeste DLC looks weird
[2:10:00] <%RubberFistFight> @Mendin probably because you spoke to him at some point and then backtracked.
[2:10:03] <%moogleboy1984> @RubberFistFight the only way to do Gemino's quest is to clear the Convent first
[2:10:06] <Mendin> No I never got to speak to him
[2:10:07] <Mister_McDerp> catholic celeste
[2:10:10] <%dukenux> eh ab it
[2:10:13] <Thirtine> LUL
[2:10:14] <TheyCallMeVawn> Exactly like Celeste :)
[2:10:17] <shevan123> celeste and this are in very different direcitons
[2:10:17] <Ominnous> yeah it's the same game
[2:10:20] <moragtang> What If Celeste Was Jesus?
[2:10:20] <%dukenux> doesnt have a stamina
[2:10:20] <b_ikki> pretty much celeste 2
[2:10:22] <%spacehouse> less boomer dialogue
[2:10:23] <mostundesired> monkaS
[2:10:23] <sharpington_> @AngriestPat what do you think of the game so far?
[2:10:24] <%RubberFistFight> @moogleboy1984 I literally just did it in that order a day ago. Whatever. I'm done arguing this point.
[2:10:25] <%StaceMcGate> imprisoned babies = cherries
[2:10:25] <DSD24> Celeste has a cuter protagonist though
[2:10:26] <%Fear_Ranjer> Oh hey you got enemy HP bars now
[2:10:27] <%CSNG> Where are the strawberries?
[2:10:29] <+kknutson4> It reminds me of The Messenger
[2:10:29] <TheyCallMeVawn> Dont forget to find all the Strawberries
[2:10:30] <+Reizie_Etherealm> Can't wait until your evil twin shows up
[2:10:30] <%FrostMass22> Celeste is under that mask
[2:10:31] <krymzen5> just this part
[2:10:32] <%dukenux> Especially in vibe :)
[2:10:35] <+Walopoh> Celeste 2: Even More Depression
[2:10:36] <%floralkami> Hold on, did y'all speak to him after getting the oil, or just looked at him and left?
[2:10:37] <$rytyoung> the music reminds me of Celeste too actually
[2:10:39] <Mendin> The strawberry is rigt there in th at reliquary
[2:10:43] <yourliteraldog> We playing Catholicvannia
[2:10:44] <%FrostMass22> @reizie_etherealm You joke but...

[2:10:56] <krymzen5> omg they are strawberries...
[2:10:56] <%arcaderabbit48> Oh, so this is what the Celeste DLC looks like!
[2:11:01] <%grayjammer> Manifestation of personal demons? Check.
[2:11:05] <%floralkami> I saw Vinny play this without any of this knowledge and it was fine.
[2:11:09] <Ominnous> see if you did celeste challenge mode it just turns into this, Hell
[2:11:24] <krymzen5> timestop
[2:11:32] <$Sphincter_Spelunker> you have not learned the ability of time stopped crouch
[2:11:34] <moragtang> You'll get it eventually, Pat. It's a vania.
[2:11:35] <Mendin> I mean celeste is about dealing with insecurities and depression, it's not quite Guilt God Curse but
[2:11:36] <%TheBitingIrish> Longsword is, in fact, long!
[2:11:48] <+Anonymasque> Some kind of aerial dash maybe?
[2:11:52] <%dukenux> What's that smell? ...

[2:15:07] <Coystick> @honestab33 it's a capirote learn the lore
[2:15:12] <Crushter> @floralkami I do, but most people probably won't but in the experimentation to figure it out, it goes give you clues though so it's not so bad, plus you can always cheat
[2:15:19] <Ominnous> even in a hellish land abandoned by god, gravity remains the crulest of injuries
[2:15:26] <SlimeSlimeSlime> Woah! Look at it go! =D
[2:15:28] <cacophanes> Pat is getting GER'd without him knowing. Is Crazy Talk finally countered??
[2:15:28] <Mendin> That hat predates the Klan and America as a whole, but fair enough we've ruined a lot of stuff
[2:15:32] <moragtang> God can't save you from physics.
[2:15:37] <%dukenux> Gravity is a fast and insidious killer
[2:15:38] <Fetidmongrel> Rushing in is a sin, Pat

[2:16:06] <%blastazoid26> Needs more royalguard
[2:16:09] <moragtang> He's rubbing himself with bile fluid.
[2:16:11] <%Typhaeon> But it will NOT knock you off a ledge
[2:16:21] <krymzen5> you can parry everything
[2:16:26] <SpicyCheeseNips> That works too

[2:33:28] <KishinGrek> About as well as any other
[2:33:43] <Mendin> You get 5 moves, and then those moves just get more betterer
[2:33:47] <moragtang> Have to hit an enemy.
[2:33:49] <%ssjklyco> are they making out with a skeleton?
[2:33:51] <SpicyCheeseNips> Hey Pat, you know you can fill up your fervor whenever you're at a resting point right?

[2:34:02] <Crushter> it, like the other combo only triggers on enemy hits

[2:35:12] <%Dr_Mooose> new tech
[2:35:13] <%SubjectX07x> Sounds like the woman who burned her face to get people to stop worshipping her like a god from that one lore bit.
[2:35:15] <%firehawk_420> Stemming from that fair lady who burned her face I suppose
[2:35:15] <%moogleboy1984> cut that grtandma in half
[2:35:17] <Coystick> Pro gamer stinger
[2:35:18] <%king_wragles> ....she melted?
[2:35:19] <gonzy92> theres another boss near the beginning
[2:35:20] <yourliteraldog> That's Christianity
[2:35:23] <KishinGrek> The church of Trogdor the burninator
[2:35:29] <%floralkami> @moragtang .... I was going to say something, but it's slight spoilers
[2:35:37] <+RiceeFTW> oh it's an air rekka?
[2:35:39] <+RiceeFTW> that's dope
[2:35:40] <+RiceeFTW> LMAO
[2:35:41] <Hyphixsys> @yourliteraldog this is true to the Bible, dude, historically accurate
[2:35:50] <Coystick> I never got the hang of the Air Impulse or saw a use for it
[2:35:58] <Crushter> @subjectx07x it is in fact a sect created in reference to that act
[2:36:04] <+emperri> remember when jesus had a greatsword
[2:36:11] <moragtang> Air Impulse is good for Church Spears.
[2:36:12] <Shacklebox> kill that guy
[2:36:14] <Hyphixsys> @emperri I remember, I was there Kappa
[2:36:17] <moragtang> But it's very situational.
[2:36:22] <mostundesired> Damn torture nuns.
[2:36:27] <$arcielardor> just finished watching the vod for the podcast and now I'll have to watch the vod for this because I'm fucking lost.
[2:36:38] <SpicyCheeseNips> ouch
[2:36:39] <Crushter> @coystick it's incredibly useful for any boss you can't normally hit, in fact you can get a bead that lets you do it four times
[2:36:42] <%Monkeyweed21> yes pat stand in the lava
[2:36:45] <%firehawk_420> That nun was no coward
[2:36:51] <omicrondeftinwolf> @emperri pfft, greatsword pales in comparison to jesus whip
[2:36:54] <Hyphixsys> that nun be crazy
[2:36:57] <SpicyCheeseNips> parry then combo those bitches
[2:37:02] <mostundesired> Pat...

[2:37:06] <%StaceMcGate> oof
[2:37:07] <b_ikki> those bell nuns are like the only enemy in the game that does big damage
[2:37:09] <+emperri> kind of?
[2:37:10] <Doodle_Taco> Hoes mad x24
[2:37:12] <KishinGrek> The book of revelation is the most metal part of the Bible, even tho its technically a fan fic
[2:37:13] <+emperri> but not really a cross
[2:37:14] <OuijaTears> I thought he was just smearing it around...
[2:37:14] <Crushter> technically he's preforming the symbol of the infinite, @angriestpat
[2:37:24] <Hyphixsys> @OuijaTears Kappa

[2:38:36] <%DedlokPM> apatGib Being babies is only thing I can be
[2:38:37] <%arcaderabbit48> Does Pat need to drop those off when he returns to town, or is that automatic?

[2:38:48] <Topazking> OH my god thats the name of a backer

[2:39:05] <+shaderichter_belmont> you stopped the magma
[2:39:08] <%Engwithan_Elder_God> Just like you planned it.
[2:39:10] <$Sphincter_Spelunker> why not
[2:39:14] <3xgilly> wait does pat have a 4 hit combo now?
[2:39:17] <laguerrilha> @SpicyCheeseNips actually you need to dodge past them
[2:39:17] <Mendin> Yep
[2:39:19] <%Calek> it's a convent about burning yourself
[2:39:27] <+Sleepy_Puma> inhalation of butthash
[2:39:28] <yourliteraldog> chamber of farts
[2:39:31] <%Laecerelius> Yeah!
[2:39:34] <mostundesired> Nice.
[2:39:36] <ShinobiPhoenix> @angriestpat is the glitch still in the game where if you hold down while attacking in the air, you bounce up as you strike and can keep attacking in the air. you even get some distance to get on ledges.

[2:40:42] <ミュウレ4242> catholic shit is weird enough. it doesn't need to be imbelisshed.
[2:40:42] <%DedlokPM> the real question is why doesn't he use the big spiked head to stab people?
[2:40:44] <Mister_McDerp> was that the holy spirit?
[2:40:44] <vulkans2> remember the laser shooting ghosts from the bible?

[2:41:28] <heart_ablaze> Pat show us Elmos glorious balls
[2:41:35] <Mendin> @ShinobiPhoenix I think it's in the pause menu that show game hints? One of the rosary beads even gives you an extra attack-bounce
[2:41:35] <Thirtine> achoo
[2:41:36] <laguerrilha> g-g-ghost!
[2:41:36] <bear_breaker20> thats a small man
[2:41:41] <moragtang> @ShinobiPhoenix Yeh there's a tutorial message that tells you about it in the menu.
[2:41:41] <+RiceeFTW> does woolie like castlevania?
[2:41:43] <%luckysteak> @AngriestPat remember you have your ground wave magic!
[2:41:44] <+TheImmortal70> This is an anti woolie game I’d think
[2:41:52] <KishinGrek> Would woolie love this game?
[2:42:03] <%floralkami> Oh fuck, you're right....
[2:42:06] <+TheImmortal70> He’d like the aesthetic but it’d just be more souls stuff
[2:42:06] <Mendin> Woolie vs All The Sin Of The World would be a hell of a video no pun intended
[2:42:06] <ミュウレ4242> is this some sort of christian magic?
[2:42:07] <$Sphincter_Spelunker> Was Woolie catholic or just christian
[2:42:10] <chronoxgp> yea i don't think whoolie likes blasphemy but he hates christianity so?
[2:42:14] <%floralkami> Woolie ain't playing this...
[2:42:15] <moragtang> Just christian.
[2:42:19] <Mister_McDerp> beware the holy spirit
[2:42:21] <+RiceeFTW> fanatic christian
[2:42:21] <laguerrilha> @KishinGrek probably to close to his childhood for him to handle
[2:42:28] <Mendin> @ミュウレ4242 Yes. Old Spanish Catholic style
[2:42:31] <%CalderGaming> @Sphincter_Spelunker 7th day adventist, very not catholic
[2:42:32] <%dukenux> Woolie was raised in an adventist tradition iirc, so this wouldnt be really familiar
[2:42:34] <%king_wragles> @AngriestPat they probably make certain enemy combos a nightmare tho
[2:42:36] <bear_breaker20> christian aesthetic, metroidvania, def a woolie game
[2:42:37] <+TheImmortal70> Beware the holy gun spirit
[2:42:37] <%FancyHatMan> God that protag design is so fuckin RAD apatLiz
[2:42:42] <haisho> those are some beefy ass ghosts
[2:42:48] <%FrostMass22> @laguerrilha Also pointy hats make him nervois
[2:42:52] <%FrostMass22> nervous
[2:42:52] <ShinobiPhoenix> you sure? I discovered it in the literal first 15 minutes of playing, so I wouldn't have gotten a message about it. it says to HOLD down while attacking to bounce?
[2:42:55] <SpicyCheeseNips> little does he know
[2:43:03] <%floralkami> Wait, but Woolie likes Metroid!
[2:43:07] <yourliteraldog> @Sphincter_Spelunker Woolie is some protestant denomination, it sounds strict Jehova's Witness maybe?
[2:43:24] <Mendin> I thought that was his brother
[2:43:24] <%dukenux> 7th Day Adventists i think?
[2:43:25] <KishinGrek> I grew up Mexican Catholic and this was nowhere as cool
[2:43:27] <%dukenux> theres a lot
[2:43:35] <%arcaderabbit48> The Father, The Son, and The Laser Spirit
[2:43:47] <$Sphincter_Spelunker> Listen, there's a lot of protestants. And we all know how catholics love protestants
[2:43:48] <ShinobiPhoenix> I also haven't played since the first day, so heard about the save bug, so I thought to wait for something higher than version 1.00
[2:43:50] <+TheImmortal70> What?
[2:43:50] <Crushter> no it's one of the most useful items in the game
[2:43:51] <yourliteraldog> @KishinGrek we don't get the cool metal shit
[2:43:51] <laguerrilha> Or a giant Bad Dragon dildo
[2:43:51] <%dukenux> @KishinGrek neither was in my case
[2:43:54] <%FrostMass22> @kishingrek Yeah, Woolie's mom worships that girl from the Ring
[2:43:58] <%moogleboy1984> plaintext "Max MP up"
[2:44:10] <chronoxgp> i think 7th day adventist actuzlly have organ music during church but im not sure

[2:44:30] <moragtang> @ShinobiPhoenix This is version 1.0.6 I think. Not sure if there was a day 1 patch.
[2:44:33] <%arcaderabbit48> @Calek Thank you. I'm actually quite proud of that one
[2:44:34] <+Sleepy_Puma> anal beads
[2:44:41] <ShinobiPhoenix> why did chat bot register a version number as a link?
[2:44:42] <+Poseidon2462> inject dem balls
[2:44:52] <+TheImmortal70> Because
[2:44:57] <%Soul_Intern> God this game is beatiful

[2:45:30] <%Soul_Intern> Nice
[2:45:32] <Hyphixsys> DSP : Bugged mechanics

[2:45:37] <Crushter> @angriestpat just parry and do the four hit combo it instagibs them

[2:45:50] <$rytyoung> @paladindupre bring me doobs now plz
[2:45:52] <ShinobiPhoenix> in any case, I was VERY much looking forward to this game when it was announced on Kickstarter, never imagined it would be on Switch. so I bought it immediately
[2:45:54] <%StaceMcGate> Does DSP still make videos?
[2:45:58] <%Soul_Intern> CRAZY TALK STRIKES AGAIN
[2:45:58] <+Walopoh> Kissing booth

[2:46:04] <KishinGrek> Unfortunately
[2:46:04] <bear_breaker20> @Monkeyweed21 death by ball inflation is real and no laughing matter
[2:46:06] <laguerrilha> @StaceMcGate hope not
[2:46:17] <laguerrilha> god dammit
[2:46:17] <Hyphixsys> he makes a ton of youtube vids LUL
[2:46:21] <b_ikki> the combo extensions do fat damage but are pretty hard to land
[2:46:25] <+OkamiDude15> So how goes the game? k3llyPOP
[2:46:28] <%StaceMcGate> I just looked him up, DSP is streaming right now
[2:46:29] <%firehawk_420> Death by ball inflation sounds hellish

[2:47:12] <KishinGrek> Why is DSP streaming
[2:47:13] <Hyphixsys> someone should mod this game and replace him with Dante from DMC Kappa
[2:47:14] <%Soul_Intern> Yet
[2:47:15] <%dukenux> thats a lotta bones
[2:47:21] <Crushter> @angriestpat also the upper cut combo finisher let's you do the falling attack for big thicc damage, you can skip the sword charge upgrades until you get access to the last one
[2:47:23] <Run44forrest> thats how dsp makes money
[2:47:24] <%floralkami> @StaceMcGate what game?
[2:47:26] <%Soul_Intern> Aw
[2:47:29] <%Soul_Intern> Thats sweet
[2:47:31] <Buzzard42> what's even the lore here
[2:47:33] <bear_breaker20> @firehawk_420 it was silicone injections that killed the man
[2:47:33] <%StaceMcGate> @floralkami Gears 5
[2:47:43] <%floralkami> @StaceMcGate of course
[2:47:47] <%Soul_Intern> @Buzzard42 As long as people love you live on in their hearts
[2:47:47] <Buzzard42> did everyone do a big sacrilege
[2:47:54] <Crushter> @buzzard42 which part, you want the short hand or the long hand
[2:47:56] <%Soul_Intern> Thats the lore
[2:47:56] <Hyphixsys> @Buzzard42 me, being born
[2:47:57] <%firehawk_420> Silicone injections in his balls?? @bear_breaker20
[2:47:58] <%CalderGaming> this game sure does have some... Relic Entertainment
[2:48:00] <%Puhff> What's the point of the collectible bones?
[2:48:10] <Buzzard42> the short hand
[2:48:15] <Crushter> @puhff money and a skin if you collect them all
[2:48:16] <%StaceMcGate> the point of the collectible bones is that they are collectible
[2:48:20] <Hyphixsys> @Puhff true ending, maybe?
[2:48:20] <ShinobiPhoenix> the last time I played, I was going to some Snowy Mountain, not sure if I am going the right way during that, but I have some quests to get oil, did Pat already do that?
[2:48:20] <+OkamiDude15> Didn’t that one dude die because he injected silicone into his balls?
[2:48:21] <Mendin> Hey @AngriestPat In case you didn't notice/realize, enemies do contact damage, so be careful with the facefucking
[2:48:22] <KishinGrek> Mmm sacrile-licious

[2:48:33] <%Monkeyweed21> she's REALLY into Katawa Shoujo
[2:48:35] <%Soul_Intern> @Puhff Win the Steel Ball Run race
[2:48:36] <+FlorianoAguirre> she burned her face so that people could stop fucking with her
[2:48:37] <LodiFrostbeard> @Puhff if you get all of them you unlock an alternate skin
[2:48:37] <Mister_McDerp> she's a nun, of course she's a bitch
[2:48:40] <%firehawk_420> Yikes

[2:48:54] <+FlorianoAguirre> she didn't build this torture chamber
[2:48:59] <SpicyCheeseNips> I don't know what that red candle is for

[3:06:18] <%Sleepy_Puma> You sold this game to me
[3:06:21] <puse9> this one!
[3:06:22] <moragtang> You don't need a double jump in this game. You get other stuff.
[3:06:23] <%bevyrage> there is a rising slash, so maybe you can jump out of it?

[3:09:49] <%rumtumtugnutz> Are you making tapenade?
[3:09:50] <cacophanes> Is this game's plot actually to make a Greek salad?

[3:09:53] <+RiceeFTW> olive garden breadsticks hggGasm hggGasm
[3:09:53] <%dalmek> this is probably my favorite art in the game coming up
[3:09:54] <Run44forrest> olive garden sucks the breadstick and salad are bomb tho
[3:09:54] <mostundesired> Oh, well then.
[3:09:55] <moragtang> @luckysteak From what I've gathered the Miracle is basically God, except it fucks with people who think they're pleasing it by suffering. It goes "oh you like suffering yeah? Then perish." But it also rewards people who are humble and help others.
[3:09:59] <KishinGrek> Damn i want pizza
[3:10:01] <Tersalus> why his hat pointy?

[3:10:50] <majindusto> CONVICTION
[3:10:50] <Mendin> Notice your meter bars now Pat
[3:10:51] <Run44forrest> vampire attack pog
[3:10:51] <KishinGrek> No its a wine
[3:10:51] <%Dakuu75> oh cool, it changed the mp bar
[3:10:52] <puse9> read the lore
[3:10:53] <%Zaphire_Saucypants> look at how much it takes tho
[3:10:54] <pabloelenano2> the lore
[3:10:57] <RupanSen> dolorosa = painful
[3:10:58] <Coystick> Ohhh fuck that's useful I think I missed it
[3:10:58] <%Zaphire_Saucypants> its cost
[3:11:01] <%RubberFistFight> @AngriestPat I believe it means you heal a little less from your vials, and you might not get fervor from it either.
[3:11:01] <%moogleboy1984> @SpicyCheeseNips did you fail Gemino's quest?
[3:11:03] <RavenMoonX> lore as well
[3:11:04] <laguerrilha> dolorosa means pain. what seta means?
[3:11:04] <yourliteraldog> easy mode now select-able?
[3:11:04] <+Zereaux> dude the artwork in this games is fucking awesome
[3:11:05] <Tucker0603> that's somberly beautiful
[3:11:05] <Mister_McDerp> READ LORE
[3:11:06] <Ominnous> nothing quite christian like vampires
[3:11:07] <Run44forrest> whats saete mean
[3:11:13] <%Soul_Intern> yeah
[3:11:16] <$Sphincter_Spelunker> We're in Hollow Knight now
[3:11:17] <DotDusk> Save the BABY
[3:11:20] <Run44forrest> "saved"
[3:11:24] <%Hydrapissed> SMOrc
[3:11:25] <Crushter> if you fail the quest you can still get the prayer
[3:11:30] <asurite_warrior> @AngriestPat You know most people expected the spanish inquisition, mostly because they were suppose to give 2 month notice in advanced to their showing.
[3:11:30] <%moogleboy1984> yes
[3:11:31] <majindusto> THE BABY
[3:11:34] <SpicyCheeseNips> @moogleboy1984 The tree guy? I gave him the burning olive oil
[3:11:35] <lexiliat_33> mostundesired means painful
[3:11:36] <snoozeaholic> Im still bothered the ranged attack has a blood effect but doesnt deplete ur hp
[3:11:39] <%moogleboy1984> but you can't get the Olive
[3:11:40] <bear_breaker20> has paige played outer wilds yet/is going to?
[3:11:42] <%StaceMcGate> our old friends
[3:11:44] <Crushter> you just need the relic that lets you fall through abysses
[3:11:47] <moragtang> @luckysteak I might be wrong on this. But after beating the game it seems like a commentary on how religious groups always do bad shit "in the game of God" or whathaveyou. And in this case God is actually punishing them for it. Except the people think this punishment is also a form of blessing.
[3:11:50] <laguerrilha> saeta means arrow. So its "arrow of pain"
[3:11:50] <%grayjammer> Holy shit the new podcast title.
[3:11:52] <Doodle_Taco> That scream really reminds me of the Hollow Knight
[3:11:54] <%RubberFistFight> Shit you're getting that looping invincibility bug EVERY DAMN TIME. This might be a cursed playthrough.
[3:11:55] <RavenMoonX> lore on new ability
[3:11:57] <Coystick> Is that the reward for getting the olive oil good end?
[3:12:04] <%doc_ock_rokc> @bear_breaker20 Paige is supposedly terrified of space
[3:12:04] <%moogleboy1984> @spicy then just put the flowers on the grave in that room and you're gold
[3:12:04] <Mendin> Yep
[3:12:05] <%marsano168> you read the lore on that spell?
[3:12:06] <$drfaustisdead> @AngriestPat if you had failed the quest you would have to wait til endgame to get it.
[3:12:12] <Laironx3> Mudmaids
[3:12:12] <mostundesired> lexiliat_33 Oh, is it actually in Spanish? I thought it was fake latin. I need to actually read this shit, then.
[3:12:12] <Coystick> Ok cool
[3:12:16] <Crushter> @moragtang it's a little more nuanced than that
[3:12:19] <%floralkami> It's not vampires if the will of god saps their strength into you
[3:12:20] <laguerrilha> didnt know Tremors was a catholic thing
[3:12:21] <Mendin> You Cant Yet
[3:12:23] <lethallylactic> You can't yet.
[3:12:34] <%Soul_Intern> Let me moan
[3:12:35] <%dukenux> those are just bm song lyrics
[3:12:36] <%luckysteak> @moragtang thank you. I am religious myself and that last thing you said made this much more palateable
[3:12:41] <%Futurecity10> Sounds like a linkin park song

[3:17:31] <moragtang> There is an animation of you getting fucked.
[3:17:34] <ShinobiPhoenix> I like how the rest of your guilt is still out there in the world to be collected
[3:17:34] <Ominnous> no matter how many times I see pat die to spikes and then immediately jump off a ledge to a place he can't see it never gets old
[3:17:38] <$drfaustisdead> @AngriestPat is this the Dark Souls demake people have been brain workshopping for years?
[3:17:41] <Hyphixsys> GUILT

[3:17:46] <Crushter> @firesparks no, you get a relic and then a spell
[3:17:51] <%FirearmsInstructor> Is there any way to see a streamers subscriber count, like youtube? Or is that a private thing?
[3:17:56] <%Soul_Intern> COOL CHURCH
[3:17:56] <%luckysteak> @Crushter I have not noticed a silver mask. will look out for it in the future

[3:18:22] <%arcaderabbit48> Seriously, what is that accent?

[3:18:36] <%NeroInfinite> Ah it's a thing
[3:18:37] <re0killer> is the person behind the sword a male?
[3:18:37] <%dalmek> The real, cool Vergil, is near the end
[3:18:37] <alexandrecau> micolash?
[3:18:39] <Hyphixsys> I mean, streamers @FirearmsInstructor
[3:18:40] <puse9> thats a confessor
[3:18:43] <Ominnous> Guilty Vergil doesn't sound very cool
[3:18:44] <anon_1307> detstroy it
[3:18:47] <%ssjklyco> I feel like his sister's head is in his weapon
[3:18:48] <mostundesired> alexandrecau AWOOO
[3:18:51] <Coystick> The dude following you should've been the cute female penitent one instead.
[3:18:52] <%FirearmsInstructor> @Hyphixsys Np I understood. :)
[3:18:52] <laguerrilha> overwatch Mercy dreams? Kreygasm
[3:18:52] <RyuuAoi> SIK
[3:18:53] <Hyphixsys> @FirearmsInstructor imo, best keep it private
[3:18:53] <%RubberFistFight> @AngriestPat those statues are literally "throw money at us and we'll magick your guilt away"
[3:18:54] <%Dakuu75> dafuq does that do? getting rid of "guilt" here?
[3:18:58] <%StaceMcGate> Did we skip a boss? I remember something before The Lady of the Scarred Visage
[3:19:03] <%dukenux> Confession
[3:19:04] <Run44forrest> thats religion
[3:19:12] <+RiceeFTW> @Dakuu75 clears the penalties from death
[3:19:15] <mostundesired> Nice
[3:19:20] <Run44forrest> whens Boss Baby
[3:19:21] <Crushter> @luckysteak he uses an incense mace actually, the silver mask showed up earlier in stream and shows up a few more times
[3:19:21] <Thirtine> @StaceMcGate he didnt to the other boss at silent sorrow
[3:19:25] <Mendin> Stace: He did that area before this one
[3:19:25] <%RubberFistFight> @StaceMcGate nah chat got insistent and he did some stuff out of order
[3:19:25] <$drfaustisdead> @AngriestPat Trap spikes aren't instant death.
[3:19:26] <moragtang> At least now this area will be pretty smooth sailing.
[3:19:31] <Mendin> @Run44forrest Not awhile yet
[3:19:34] <%FirearmsInstructor> @Hyphixsys Yea probably... it just came across my mind because I saw "Followers" at the top. Thought "How many subs does someone have?" But since it's related to $ I get why it's hidden.
[3:19:34] <Coystick> Someone didn't play the demo
[3:19:36] <%DedlokPM> @FirearmsInstructor Technically it is supposed to be private, or at least it used to be, but some streamers will let it be publicly known. That said I am unaware of any sites that present the data/have api of it.
[3:19:39] <FrankysDream> @AngriestPat have you changed sword cores?
[3:19:41] <%KikiBunni> the bonfires are very good in this game
[3:19:43] <Crushter> @rubberfistfight there is no order
[3:19:47] <%luckysteak> @Crushter Awesome. I'll have to pay more attention
[3:19:50] <%Dakuu75> @RiceeFTW the only penalty from death is the lower-max-MP though, yeah?
[3:19:55] <%FirearmsInstructor> @DedlokPM Thanks. :)
[3:19:58] <Mendin> And reduced mp-gain and money-gain
[3:20:01] <mostundesired> PogChamp
[3:20:02] <%Ion_Laser> NICE
[3:20:04] <%CalderGaming> damn
[3:20:04] <laguerrilha> Yo!
[3:20:04] <Thirtine> PogChamp
[3:20:04] <%GabeSweetMan> ouch

[3:20:07] <%dukenux> apatSkelmoney
[3:20:07] <Coystick> Yeah that's weirdly inconsistent come to think of it
[3:20:07] <$Sphincter_Spelunker> jeez joel
[3:20:09] <%Dr_Mooose> ow
[3:20:09] <+RiceeFTW> @Dakuu75 also lowers the currency gain
[3:20:10] <%arcaderabbit48> I believe the incense mace he wields is the origin for why clerics and priests use maces and hammers in D&D and similiar type games
[3:20:10] <%Dakuu75> Fatality
[3:20:12] <Ominnous> The cover art!
[3:20:15] <Ominnous> I clapped when I saw it
[3:20:15] <Run44forrest> mimic?
[3:20:19] <Doodle_Taco> ITS PAT
[3:20:20] <%luckysteak> freaky flagellants
[3:20:22] <+wandorx_x> Are those parries or just blocking
[3:20:26] <%Dakuu75> @RiceeFTW @FrostMass22 I see, I see~
[3:20:26] <%StaceMcGate> @RubberFistFight Ah, so we went to the harder dungeon first?
[3:20:29] <ミュウレ4242> he didn't expect the spanish inquisition.
[3:20:30] <Thirtine> D:
[3:20:32] <%dukenux> monkaS
[3:20:33] <Crushter> parry
[3:20:34] <%Soul_Intern> Oh
[3:20:35] <%FirearmsInstructor> @AngriestPat What level are you? (If applicable.)
[3:20:35] <Mister_McDerp> monkaS
[3:20:36] <%dukenux> well then
[3:20:39] <moragtang> Those can be either a block or a parry depending on the enemy.
[3:20:40] <%Sol_Install> oh.
[3:20:45] <%FrostMass22> @wandorx_x There's only a parry
[3:20:45] <mostundesired> Do those levers do anything?
[3:20:46] <%Soul_Intern> That went real dark real quick
[3:20:46] <+Zereaux> the fuck is a sactrasy?
[3:20:49] <puse9> his sword is now level 2
[3:20:51] <%king_wragles> Oh, he collected bones and wanted to show them to people!
[3:20:52] <%KoyaMusa> just a hungry man
[3:20:52] <%floralkami> Y'all wanna talk about edge, kids?
[3:20:52] <%RubberFistFight> @Crushter I'd consider the path of least resistance to be ordered before the path of MOST resistance. Apparently that makes me wrong, bad, crazy and an asshole though, so whatever.
[3:20:53] <Mendin> Mea Culpa level 2, health and energy level 2
[3:20:53] <%moogleboy1984> @FirearmsInstructor there are no levels in the game
[3:20:56] <Run44forrest> are you carrying all those bones now
[3:21:00] <Doodle_Taco> White palace flashbacks NotLikeThis NotLikeThis NotLikeThis NotLikeThis NotLikeThis
[3:21:04] <%dukenux> sacristy is a small room in the back of a church

[3:21:17] <%moogleboy1984> yup
[3:21:22] <+FlorianoAguirre> it's much
[3:21:23] <+FlorianoAguirre> much
[3:21:26] <Mister_McDerp> sacristy is next to the altar I think
[3:21:26] <+FlorianoAguirre> easier
[3:21:26] <%Soul_Intern> @Doodle_Taco God it totally reminds me of it
[3:21:30] <Thirtine> LUL charred visage is hardest
[3:21:30] <%moogleboy1984> technically the sword gains power from shrines
[3:21:31] <+Jokylvl> Hidden wall
[3:21:32] <%FrostMass22> @angriestpat Does Paige know that you collect bones in this game?
[3:21:32] <+FlorianoAguirre> easiest
[3:21:32] <moragtang> You went to Blighttown first.
[3:21:33] <mostundesired> Can't get much harder.
[3:21:33] <%RubberFistFight> @StaceMcGate yeah, although there's people here insisting there's no such thing.
[3:21:35] <%moogleboy1984> this is Undead Burg
[3:21:37] <+RiceeFTW> def the easiest
[3:21:38] <puse9> its the first area
[3:21:39] <Mendin> Easiest
[3:21:41] <Coystick> You went to the Catacombs before Undead Burg
[3:21:43] <%DedlokPM> @FirearmsInstructor Or I could be full of it/things have changed. Just googled and there is a Twitch Tracker website that seems to have it laid out, all with piad, prime, and gifted counts
[3:21:47] <Mendin> This entire level was the demo
[3:21:50] <$drfaustisdead> God I love that is riposte hits everything.
[3:21:50] <%sirisvirus> by far the easiest
[3:21:52] <mostundesired> She sounded so intrigued LUL
[3:21:54] <%Ranryu692> so has she
[3:21:54] <Coystick> The lust in her voice
[3:21:56] <%dukenux> Its where the priest readies for the sermon
[3:21:56] <%mh9s> that IMMEDIATE interest
[3:21:56] <$Sphincter_Spelunker> not for fucking
[3:21:56] <%marsano168> I think you New Londo'd when you should have undead burg=ed
[3:21:56] <Run44forrest> really? LUL
[3:21:57] <%RubberFistFight> @AngriestPat this is the area you should do first. It's definitely the undead burg. The other area was more or less the catacombs.

[3:22:11] <moragtang> Remember your ranged move, Pat. It's big fucking good. Specially against flying guys.

[3:41:59] <mostundesired> Why?
[3:42:04] <%derekwst3> hi cheese head
[3:42:05] <RupanSen> it's a reference to the sculpture La Pietà, which is by Michelangelo IIRC
[3:42:06] <RyuuAoi> Pat kicked that things ass.
[3:42:06] <zamzoph> monkaS
[3:42:06] <$SvenHolgersson> Hello droopy waxman
[3:42:07] <Notterr> It's means "Next you're gonna say.."
[3:42:08] <CurrySauseBandit> Dats a lot of dead people
[3:42:10] <moragtang> I think it was more fun watching Pat struggle through the ice area before coming here. LUL
[3:42:11] <ElectricHoodie> oh what in the fresh fuck is this now
[3:42:12] <%Soul_Intern> @Tony0ni Yes
[3:42:12] <%Laecerelius> Gold Face McSkullguy
[3:42:13] <Crushter> that's gold
[3:42:14] <+Walopoh> My name... is OZYMANDIAS

[3:42:20] <%hntronium> Amen
[3:42:20] <DraxTD> *pops back in* THE HELL am I looking at?!?
[3:42:28] <%derekwst3> @ElectricHoodie I think that's suppose to be virgil
[3:42:30] <mostundesired> I can't tell if these game devs really speak spanish, or really don't speak spanish.
[3:42:33] <alexandrecau> it's just lion king with the spirit in the cloud
[3:42:35] <%dukenux> there are a bunch of Pieta sculptures, which are just Marys holding bodies of Jesuses
[3:42:35] <%Soul_Intern> @DraxTD God
[3:42:36] <Thirtine> 👏
[3:42:38] <$Sphincter_Spelunker> seems like that was supposed to be the first one
[3:42:41] <%RubberFistFight> @floralkami I didn't even really want to bring it up because I'm a nobody and don't want to be seen as "clout stealing" but like... it really stings that I helped out BTS and am still getting ripped on.
[3:42:42] <+arfsm95> !
[3:42:43] <ShinobiPhoenix> rh
[3:42:43] <Camail> wait are there 3 dreamers
[3:42:44] <juxtest> Maybe the giant head is holding out on you
[3:42:44] <LodiFrostbeard> @mostundesired they're spanish
[3:42:44] <puse9> because this is suppose to be the first area
[3:42:45] <%Jrocy247> @DraxTD Weird Catholic sht
[3:42:47] <%bevyrage> @mostundesired they don't speak spanish, they speak _latin_
[3:42:47] <%dukenux> but yeah, PIE DAD is a strong name for a demon
[3:42:50] <DraxTD> @Soul_Intern do not accept it
[3:42:53] <+RiceeFTW> yeah this was level 1 of 3, you did level 3 first
[3:42:56] <+arfsm95> @AngriestPat this is the place you get to in the secret room, nice
[3:42:57] <mostundesired> @LodiFrostbeard Spain Spanish?

[3:43:12] <Doodle_Taco> @mostundesired Yes I think
[3:43:12] <moragtang> The music for this area is fuckin rad.
[3:43:14] <+Walopoh> God the amount of time to make all this art
[3:43:15] <%RubberFistFight> WE DEAD CELLS NOW
[3:43:15] <mostundesired> No wonder it's gibberish Kappa
[3:43:15] <Mendin> Ooh there's some good spanish guitar riffs
[3:43:18] <Notterr> cream pie daddy?
[3:43:19] <%Dakuu75> is there more video-game after the third thing? or that's it?
[3:43:26] <ShinobiPhoenix> @mostundesired The devs are from and located in Spain and some of this stuff is based on a real city.
[3:43:28] <moragtang> There is more video-game.
[3:43:29] <anon_1307> coward
[3:43:29] <%RubberFistFight> @Dakuu75 more video game.
[3:43:32] <%moogleboy1984> @Notterr DESIST
[3:43:34] <+RiceeFTW> there's def more
[3:43:35] <%Piemen99> damn i missed the boss fight? damn didnt think he'll get it first try
[3:43:36] <Thirtine> theres more yep
[3:43:41] <$Sphincter_Spelunker> anor londo
[3:43:44] <%nmaten> like a zelda
[3:43:44] <%Dakuu75> OOOoooh, ok. wicked
[3:43:45] <+RiceeFTW> @Dakuu75 I meant more like 3 paths
[3:43:46] <puse9> yup
[3:43:47] <mostundesired> So it's just like Dark Souls
[3:43:47] <%king_wragles> OH, so this is a Darksouls then?
[3:43:47] <StarsCrusader> Correct
[3:43:47] <%derekwst3> i cant wait for nine cake mom
[3:43:48] <%Tredecian> @Notterr don't creampie your dad
[3:43:48] <%Tenkay> Its Anor Londo
[3:43:49] <RavenMoonX> correct
[3:43:49] <moragtang> It's literally just the Bells of Awakening.
[3:43:52] <%RubberFistFight> @Piemen99 he's killed 2 bosses. He did Our Charred Lady early.
[3:43:52] <Mendin> Yeah these are the bells of awakening
[3:43:55] <%sirisvirus> yep open the door to anor londo
[3:43:57] <%king_wragles> What genre even is dark souls?
[3:43:59] <+FlorianoAguirre> The game is based on catholic mythology, and their own regional legends, like the Sevilla Legends
[3:44:00] <%Laecerelius> Didn't even get a sword upgrade. Tsk.
[3:44:00] <$Sphincter_Spelunker> LOOK
[3:44:00] <+Walopoh> This game is like if OwlBoy live up to the hype
[3:44:03] <+RiceeFTW> si RING THE BELLS
[3:44:03] <%marsano168> become giant
[3:44:03] <%Bt_Robot> BONES
[3:44:04] <$Sphincter_Spelunker> there it was!
[3:44:05] <%floralkami> @RubberFistFight naw, fuckem. Literally use Pat's example of borderline sociopathic nihilism (jks)
[3:44:07] <%Calek> @king_wragles action rpg
[3:44:11] <LodiFrostbeard> @king_wragles JRPG
[3:44:15] <%Nina96> !uptime
[3:44:16] <@Moobot> I've been playing this game for how long? Oh only 3h 44m.
[3:44:18] <RavenMoonX> bones?
[3:44:21] <%king_wragles> @Calek ya that feels right
[3:44:21] <bear_breaker20> adventure too*
[3:44:22] <%AncelDeLambert> so we're quite actually finding Lord Souls?
[3:44:24] <%Soul_Intern> METROIDVANIA
[3:44:25] <puse9> time to bones
[3:44:25] <%doc_ock_rokc> @moragtang if you are gonna say what I say all the time i'm gonna ask you where my carkeys are
[3:44:26] <+arfsm95> @AngriestPat bones in secret room
[3:44:26] <%Calek> jrpg isn't a genre
[3:44:28] <%PrincessLuna85> PrincessLuna85 subscribed with Twitch Prime. They've subscribed for 14 months! neat
[3:44:30] <%logoth_> Key of Dycedarg's Elder Brother
[3:44:30] <%Bt_Robot> Put the bones to rest
[3:44:35] <Hyphixsys> @Calek LUL LUL
[3:44:36] <%luckysteak> do you have to go to the blood fountain for the bile jar?
[3:44:38] <Run44forrest> how much is this? $20? $30?
[3:44:41] <Coystick> They're more the Bells of Awakening+Sen's Fort
[3:44:41] <%Laecerelius> Also you can do that downstab secret
[3:44:42] <ShinobiPhoenix> @mostundesired I read almost everything on the Kickstarter page. this aesthetic is all of my jam
[3:44:42] <mostundesired> @AncelDeLambert They're called Penitence, but yes.
[3:44:43] <+Walopoh> CATHOLIC SOULS
[3:44:43] <%Zaphire_Saucypants> what about that dude inside the fountain?
[3:44:44] <Crushter> @luckysteak yes
[3:44:44] <%dukenux> yeah, Sevilla has a holiday with bunch of penance pilgrims that wear spiky hats
[3:44:47] <%GabeSweetMan> The torture devices created during the inquisition were FUCKED.
[3:44:48] <RyuuAoi> !schedule
[3:44:50] <moragtang> @doc_ock_rokc Have you looked under your sofa? OneHand
[3:44:53] <%Piemen99> At least they got something right in christannity
[3:44:58] <%KoyaMusa> don't you have another bile jar?
[3:44:59] <%AncelDeLambert> This, indeed, is Metroidvania. You know why? Because Dark Souls is a Metroidvania!
[3:44:59] <mostundesired> YOOOOO
[3:45:01] <%derekwst3> @AngriestPat but pie dad
[3:45:04] <Thirtine> like you doing charred lady early
[3:45:08] <%Calek> dark souls isn't a metroid vania
[3:45:15] <+Order_of_Mystery> hey chat; is diablo 2 still good? did it age well?
[3:45:15] <%GabeSweetMan> These death animaytions are amazing.
[3:45:17] <+FlorianoAguirre> lol
[3:45:17] <%GabeSweetMan> WHAT
[3:45:19] <%moogleboy1984> the traversal abilities lead to other upgrades and lore
[3:45:20] <Hyphixsys> WOOOW
[3:45:22] <Notterr> good luck beating final boss without invincibility
[3:45:25] <%Nina96> its not?
[3:45:26] <%AncelDeLambert> Dark Souls is just 3D Castlevania, yes it is
[3:45:30] <vulkans2> good job guy
[3:45:31] <%logoth_> Is that a glory floor?
[3:45:32] <%StaceMcGate> So that would be a 1 then yes?
[3:45:35] <%king_wragles> @Calek I mean, this seems like a very enjoyable blend of the 2
[3:45:38] <%MrBorisMakarov> oh
[3:45:39] <%Dakuu75> Child bones
[3:45:43] <mostundesired> So this is Dark Souls, but if Gwyn was the Catholic Monarchs instead.
[3:45:48] <Run44forrest> no one wants to be ONE GUY but everyone wants to be Chat
[3:45:49] <Doodle_Taco> FLYING GOATS????????
[3:45:51] <%GabeSweetMan> Time Stop
[3:45:55] <%RubberFistFight> @AngriestPat there's some variation in terms of challenge, like amount of damage mobs deal out vs how much they take to kill, which is why that bug we talked about is so gamebreaking, but otherwise yeah - if you're good enough you could make it to the end with the starting stuff and no more. Basically a Soul Level 1 run.
[3:45:55] <+luftraumm1> @angriestpat go down from town and all the way to the left
[3:45:58] <ShinobiPhoenix> I found this SUPER early by accident because I use my Down strike a lot
[3:46:00] <absolute_cagemony> guys I got buffalo sauce in my eye, plz help
[3:46:02] <%doc_ock_rokc> @mostundesired ...kinda
[3:46:04] <Crushter> okay so you need a later game item to go over there, not just the platform maker
[3:46:15] <Notterr> @mostundesired yes, and your character is LITTERALY Jesus.
[3:46:17] <%moogleboy1984> 15-20 hours
[3:46:17] <%Calek> took me 13 hours to beat
[3:46:18] <%king_wragles> 10 minutes
[3:46:18] <%Dakuu75> oh-man. I ove how the wheel-guy looks up at you, before you crush his skull with the wheel
[3:46:19] <%RubberFistFight> 12 - 15 hoursish
[3:46:21] <%Meekest> Ten minutes
[3:46:23] <%Yadogari> 200 hours
[3:46:23] <moragtang> Depends. Can be 7 hours or 20 hours.
[3:46:25] <+RiceeFTW> depends
[3:46:25] <Coystick> 24 hours for me and I'm near the end
[3:46:27] <candidateplays> I did it in 14
[3:46:29] <%floralkami> 8-10 hrs
[3:46:30] <%Piemen99> 300 hours long/s
[3:46:31] <%derekwst3> @AngriestPat for you about 50 hours
[3:46:36] <+RiceeFTW> you're making good pace, so prob like 15-20
[3:46:36] <+Zereaux> 3-4 streams
[3:46:37] <StarsCrusader> 10-15
[3:46:38] <Mendin> @AngriestPat There's an achievement for getting to Anor Londo in 3 hours. I took 5-6
[3:46:42] <hellfirejefe> about 10 hours for me
[3:46:42] <Crushter> @notterr your character is not literally Jesus, he's a Knight who decides to fix the broken world
[3:46:44] <StonerStan101> Well better put this game on my steam wishlist, because it is one of the most Metal games I've seen.
[3:46:44] <Whiskey_T_Foxtrot> Do you think it's a better 2D souls than Salt&Sanctuary?
[3:46:46] <%AncelDeLambert> How many much good you are
[3:46:48] <%floralkami> Like 2-3 streams
[3:46:51] <%Calek> 13 hours 93% take that what you will
[3:46:51] <%moogleboy1984> it took me about 25 to 100% the game
[3:46:58] <%GabeSweetMan> Certainly better looking that S&S.
[3:46:59] <%RubberFistFight> @Whiskey_T_Foxtrot since he hates S&S I'd say yeah
[3:46:59] <Coystick> At your pace I'd say 15-17 hours
[3:47:01] <+Arsimckhoi> so all of them... which means 90+ hours
[3:47:01] <%moogleboy1984> there's an achievement for beating the bosses without healing
[3:47:04] <lexiliat_33> It took me 33 hours but to be fair 10 where probably backtracking
[3:47:04] <Notterr> @Crushter by dying for others sins...
[3:47:07] <mrjellyfish877> PatPatPatPatPattyteePAT
[3:47:11] <%GabeSweetMan> S&S's art was what turned me off on it.
[3:47:12] <%derekwst3> @AngriestPat when is banjo kazooie
[3:47:13] <%trueGarnish> yoink
[3:47:13] <majindusto> Depends on how "Bad-Ass" you are
[3:47:14] <%dukenux> Steel reliquaries
[3:47:16] <Hyphixsys> PILLAGE THY CHURCH
[3:47:16] <%Dakuu75> SNATCH AND RUN~!
[3:47:18] <moragtang> Salt and Sanctuary is cool, but jank. This one is more put-together.
[3:47:19] <%StaceMcGate> OOOOOH
[3:47:20] <Run44forrest> BLOOD POCKET SAND
[3:47:20] <%Meekest> Sand Undertale
[3:47:20] <%Nina96> @AngriestPat this harder than hollow knight so far?
[3:47:22] <cassiecagedd> jump jump jump
[3:47:23] <Thirtine> ayy
[3:47:24] <mostundesired> S&S was really clunky. It's not even that bad, I just hate the controls.
[3:47:29] <pabloelenano2> lore
[3:47:29] <lexiliat_33> time stop!!!
[3:47:30] <Crushter> @notterr martyrdom is not something unique to Jesus
[3:47:30] <RavenMoonX> lore
[3:47:34] <%dukenux> damn
[3:47:35] <RyuuAoi> Shoulda been a mimic
[3:47:47] <Coystick> I just started S&S and aside from the jank character models I like what I'm seeing
[3:47:47] <Mendin> You have achieved one of the Three Great Accessibility Timestops
[3:47:48] <%GabeSweetMan> Pocket Bluuud
[3:47:51] <%moogleboy1984> Hollow Knight is a more satisfying play, but this game is no slouch
[3:47:51] <%RubberFistFight> @mostundesired I didn't like how a lot of the boss mechanics were just cornertrap stunlocks. Mad Alchemist was particularly bad for that.
[3:47:51] <Run44forrest> mustve been a sick orgy
[3:47:51] <mostundesired> Now that's a boss hallway.
[3:47:56] <Notterr> @Crushter it's pretty obvious they were going for that though
[3:47:57] <karl_rex> Wow thats a lot of cone heads
[3:47:57] <Whiskey_T_Foxtrot> Hollow Knight's hardest parts are effectively optional.
[3:47:59] <%StaceMcGate> gay orgy GONE WRONG
[3:48:01] <Doodle_Taco> Right now it seems easier imo
[3:48:02] <StarsCrusader> The rewards for getting all the collectables are super not worth it, imo
[3:48:05] <Crushter> you need a second item for that pat
[3:48:06] <LodiFrostbeard> bosses in this game are way easier than hollow knight, everything else is harder imo
[3:48:07] <%luckysteak> Hollow knight was such a good game, the atmosphere and storytelling were the best of all metroidvanias I have played
[3:48:07] <waifoong98> is this Vlad wet dream?
[3:48:08] <mrjellyfish877> Why didn't you like Salt and Sanctuary?
[3:48:09] <majindusto> What was Salt and Sanctuary again? I forget
[3:48:12] <ElectricHoodie> did we ever learn what was up with all the naked dead dudes here?
[3:48:18] <Run44forrest> orgy pat
[3:48:21] <$Sphincter_Spelunker> why aren't you
[3:48:21] <%Calek> Salt and Sanctuary really needed a map
[3:48:22] <%Dakuu75> orgy
[3:48:22] <%dukenux> @Notterr not necesirally. there are shitload of martyr saints in the catholic church
[3:48:23] <%king_wragles> @AngriestPat because they don't have clothes on
[3:48:23] <Mendin> S&S was the first 2d soulslike platformer
[3:48:24] <%DedlokPM> Orgy
[3:48:25] <%Ion_Laser> Cause of THE SEX
[3:48:25] <%mh9s> why aren't YOU naked
[3:48:27] <mostundesired> @RubberFistFight The biggest disappointment to me was that I couldn't really use guns to parry, especially not bosses.
[3:48:27] <Crushter> @electrichoodie it's converted in the comic
[3:48:28] <moragtang> Salt and Sanctuary is the literal 2D Dark Souls.
[3:48:33] <+valkuma> There are secret you have to crouch slash to open
[3:48:34] <%RubberFistFight> Hollow Knight has fucking TRUCKLOADS of content too, and the difficulty ramps up. My save has nearly 50 hours on it and I still haven't beaten The Radiance.
[3:48:34] <Coystick> Why aren't you, you're the exception
[3:48:37] <%moogleboy1984> commit it to memory
[3:48:40] <Mendin> Pay look carefully at the underside of that platform
[3:48:42] <%derekwst3> haha
[3:48:43] <RavenMoonX> blood lore
[3:48:46] <puse9> you need something else, pat
[3:48:50] <moragtang> Yeah Hollow Knight is MUCH longer than this one.
[3:48:54] <Notterr> @dukenux did they also weild a sword with a THORN?
[3:48:56] <+creamandsugar> cause everytime you die~ They leave your corpse there~
[3:48:57] <majindusto> Yeah i cant remember it at all
[3:49:05] <Run44forrest> doesnt salt and sanctuary have like little big planet characters
[3:49:07] <Mendin> That's the timestop you need
[3:49:09] <%RubberFistFight> @mostundesired yeah. Also there's the fact that it claims not to be trying to be like Souls - whilst actually trying REALLY HARD to ape it.
[3:49:18] <%Dakuu75> in the background is crucifide jesus
[3:49:18] <%Laecerelius> grapple?
[3:49:21] <%moogleboy1984> Vinesauce?
[3:49:21] <Buzzard42> timestop
[3:49:24] <%GabeSweetMan> Hollow Knight is effectively infinite because I can't beat the Pantheon.
[3:49:26] <%hntronium> dead cells vine thing?
[3:49:26] <%Bt_Robot> It's blud!
[3:49:27] <%moogleboy1984> Shuut
[3:49:28] <%trueGarnish> vineMortis
[3:49:33] <%GabeSweetMan> Godseeker is nuuuuts
[3:49:35] <Hyphixsys> @moogleboy1984 Michael here
[3:49:36] <+nekodelic> BLOOD
[3:49:39] <%RubberFistFight> @AngriestPat you need a timestop. A different timestop to the one you just got though.
[3:49:42] <%dalmek> not crucified. twisted
[3:49:43] <%derekwst3> he had no powers
[3:49:43] <%moogleboy1984> I'm more of a Vinny guy
[3:49:46] <%Dr_Mooose> yeah, unlike his dad
[3:49:47] <%dukenux> @Notterr thorns from christ's crown were one of those relics that were really popular(and falsified to boot), so yeah, i can imagine a saint with them as an atribute
[3:49:50] <%Dakuu75> everyone knows Jesus. he's a bro
[3:49:51] <%Divryne> Nice prank Jesus we thought you died on the cross.
[3:49:52] <bear_breaker20> HATES merchants
[3:49:56] <+nekodelic> remember blood?
[3:49:56] <Crushter> @notterr you're aware that tree imagery is common in Catholicism, the growth of plants
[3:49:57] <%Jrocy247> I REALLY hope you get to fight Jesus in this game....
[3:50:00] <moragtang> It's not a boss, just a vitally important upgrade. LUL
[3:50:05] <RyuuAoi> Jesus loves you
[3:50:08] <+creamandsugar> @angriestpat blood?
[3:50:08] <%doc_ock_rokc> @RubberFistFight They might be trying to copy beserk
[3:50:10] <mostundesired> @RubberFistFight Yeah. As opposed to this, which is CLEARLY trying to emulate the Souls atmosphere but with a twist. Somehow, you're way more creative when you embrace that you're copying other shit.
[3:50:17] <%Dakuu75> "Jesus wants a hug"
[3:50:19] <Notterr> @Crushter not really, i'm from israel :P heh, i know nothing about christianity ^_^
[3:50:19] <Run44forrest> what if jesus FACE/OFF ed with another guy
[3:50:22] <%ssjklyco> Apparently Jesus is an Engineer in Alien lore.
[3:50:29] <moragtang> Ite's real fuckin' fast.
[3:50:34] <%moogleboy1984> approximately 33% faster
[3:50:37] <%Jrocy247> WHEEL SKELETON
[3:50:37] <%derekwst3> Jesus was a stand user
[3:50:41] <%RubberFistFight> @mostundesired that's the difference between "strongly inspired by" and "shitty low budget clone"
[3:50:45] <mostundesired> Fast, and doesn't last long Kappa
[3:50:51] <%arcaderabbit48> Ticket to Ride
[3:50:53] <Hyphixsys> @mostundesired Kappa
[3:51:02] <+nekodelic> pat didn't remember blood
[3:51:05] <%RubberFistFight> ahh, the powers of TIMESTOP
[3:51:06] <Crushter> @notterr then you should know that the character is a nobody, he's no son of God, he just wants to help
[3:51:07] <bear_breaker20> they hated jesus, fore he talked shit on main
[3:51:14] <%moogleboy1984> it's obviously blue
[3:51:15] <%dukenux> thanks 50 cent: Blood on Sand Kappa
[3:51:15] <%Laecerelius> Nice
[3:51:17] <bluecrayon203> what the hell is this? A side scrolling dark souls?
[3:51:19] <Mendin> That one's decent
[3:51:27] <Run44forrest> if jesus was so strong why is he dead
[3:51:29] <majindusto> He finally got Time Stop
[3:51:34] <mostundesired> @bluecrayon203 Catholic Souls
[3:51:40] <al0nem0nster> was there a platform and n that hole he found with the dead kid bone?
[3:51:40] <%RubberFistFight> @mostundesired I've mentioned it a few times but this game also draws strongly from the OG Prince of Persia. The spike pits you fall into with the insta-death immediately made me think of that game.
[3:51:40] <+luftraumm1> you missed a secret room in mercy dreams
[3:51:43] <%Jrocy247> LUL
[3:51:44] <$Sphincter_Spelunker> @bluecrayon203 It's the catholic church's way to get us to go to church again
[3:51:45] <%dukenux> Martyr Souls
[3:51:51] <%Dakuu75> when do we unlock more rosary slots? got like, 2 slots and 50 beads now
[3:51:52] <Run44forrest> couldve been cooler
[3:51:52] <Crushter> @angriestpat there's a comic that explains how your character got to where they are at the beginning
[3:51:53] <%dukenux> or what was that other name
[3:51:56] <%dukenux> Bileborne
[3:51:57] <al0nem0nster> or were those just atmosphere sparkles?
[3:52:01] <Crushter> figured you might want to know
[3:52:03] <%Jrocy247> MUD BABIES
[3:52:04] <Coystick> DENIED
[3:52:06] <moragtang> Yeah this game is Gumbo. It's just a ton of stuffed mashed together. And it does mashed good.
[3:52:08] <Hyphixsys> LUL
[3:52:09] <+HitoBeat> Pogo jump on the enemies
[3:52:11] <%RubberFistFight> @AngriestPat there's another ANOTHER timestop you need there. So you need 2 more timestops. LUL
[3:52:12] <Notterr> @Crushter you're taking me too seriously :P but in my eyes he's acting out a story similar to jesus
[3:52:15] <Run44forrest> down attack on them?
[3:52:22] <%Dakuu75> for real? I wanna see that comic
[3:52:26] <%Zaphire_Saucypants> is there an ability that has you use the enemies to bounce across to the platform?
[3:52:27] <pabloelenano2> me too
[3:52:30] <lexiliat_33> there is a comic
[3:52:31] <pabloelenano2> link it here
[3:52:31] <+nekodelic> down attack pogo
[3:52:33] <%pilgrimsayswhat> So when do you get a Y Prompt on Jesus
[3:52:33] <Mendin> There's another timestop
[3:52:34] <+wandorx_x> This area looks not great
[3:52:37] <candidateplays> Isn't the opening of the game a woman praying you into existence?
[3:52:39] <Buzzard42> link it here
[3:52:40] <$Sphincter_Spelunker> no links in chat. he means on twitter
[3:52:41] <%Jrocy247> That's so fucking METAL
[3:52:43] <+arfsm95> @AngriestPat bones in secret room
[3:52:45] <%RubberFistFight> I love the stomp at the end
[3:52:51] <%RubberFistFight> like GRUH and it pops
[3:52:52] <%GabeSweetMan> Satisfying crunch.
[3:52:57] <%pilgrimsayswhat> LUL LUL LUL
[3:52:59] <mostundesired> You're LITERALLY collecting Penitence.
[3:52:59] <%derekwst3> you are dante not jesus
[3:53:01] <bear_breaker20> @Notterr but you just said you didnt know shit about christianity
[3:53:01] <%arcaderabbit48> @AngriestPat Deposit your bones in the Bone Zone
[3:53:02] <%Divryne> No do it on Facebook.
[3:53:03] <ElectricHoodie> it looks like you can buy it on steam?
[3:53:04] <+shaderichter_belmont> When do we get to the Mozgus bossfight?
[3:53:08] <+creamandsugar> no new blood?
[3:53:09] <lexiliat_33> after he got the sword a cool lady kick his as and throw him in there
[3:53:13] <%RubberFistFight> @mostundesired well i mean, only the penitent man shall pass.
[3:53:15] <RyuuAoi> Pat Jesus. LETS GO
[3:53:15] <%Dakuu75> Dante IS my Jesus
[3:53:19] <Buzzard42> B O N E S
[3:53:21] <%GabeSweetMan> BONE ZONE
[3:53:22] <%Bt_Robot> YAY!!!
[3:53:24] <moragtang> Just type "Blasphemous comic" on google, chat. It's on sale on Steam and GOG.

[3:53:32] <RyuuAoi> Pat is my Hitler
[3:53:36] <%logoth_> My only regret is that I have bone itis
[3:53:38] <%king_wragles> roll them bones
[3:53:38] <%AncelDeLambert> Pat being Jesus would be the WORST thing for humanity!
[3:53:40] <Notterr> @bear_breaker20 and i don't!
[3:53:41] <laguerrilha> good at collecting booners
[3:53:43] <%KoyaMusa> @AngriestPat don't you still have another bile jar?
[3:53:45] <%doc_ock_rokc> Paige will remember that
[3:53:50] <%RubberFistFight> @AncelDeLambert that's a weird way to say BEST THING EVER.
[3:53:53] <mostundesired> Paige go UP
[3:53:54] <%AncelDeLambert> "Fuck all y'all, you put me on a cross!" Patrick Christ
[3:53:54] <$Sphincter_Spelunker> @Dakuu75 2010's Dante from Dante's Inferno? I'm sorry
[3:53:55] <%DedlokPM> Would Paige agree with that statement? rooThink
[3:53:56] <%Zaphire_Saucypants> what of the fountain guy?
[3:53:56] <Notterr> @bear_breaker20 so you should probably stop listening to me! :D
[3:53:57] <luckyifpurple> Man I thought most bone deposits would involve page
[3:53:58] <%Bt_Robot> Are you actually reassembling Dracula?
[3:53:59] <RyuuAoi> @anceldelambert Reach out and touch faith
[3:53:59] <+wandorx_x> Wheres griffith
[3:54:04] <mostundesired> WAIT.
[3:54:05] <mostundesired> IT'S JOJO
[3:54:09] <mostundesired> WE'RE COLLECTING JESUS BONES
[3:54:09] <%dukenux> Pat the Christ: Nah fuck this, im outta here *goes down from the cross*
[3:54:10] <+FlorianoAguirre> there is one in every single path
[3:54:14] <+FlorianoAguirre> you missed one
[3:54:15] <Run44forrest> if your headstone doesnt say rest in peace you automatically get drafted into the skeleton war
[3:54:19] <%pilgrimsayswhat> When you put all the bones together do you get a stand
[3:54:20] <%Bt_Robot> Collecting bones reminds me of Castlevania 2
[3:54:22] <%derekwst3> do the work get the gains
[3:54:23] <%RubberFistFight> @AncelDeLambert "just throw it on the ground, it's fine, the whole planet is a trash pile." Patrick "Jesus" FuckBoivin Kappa
[3:54:23] <%ssjklyco> how is that weird?
[3:54:25] <%Soul_Intern> @mostundesired Duh LUL
[3:54:26] <%arcaderabbit48> I'm telling you, those bones are going to link together to form Skeleton Catholic Voltron
[3:54:27] <%king_wragles> @AngriestPat why did you just kill Jesus carrying a statue?
[3:54:29] <%logoth_> You now prosess draculas rib
[3:54:38] <+Estuko> how's the game ?
[3:54:48] <Crushter> does Pat prefer dms or regular tweets
[3:54:49] <%RubberFistFight> @king_wragles they're actually naked ladies carrying statues.
[3:54:50] <%king_wragles> @RubberFistFight that one is cooler than the wheel guys
[3:54:57] <%king_wragles> ah
[3:55:00] <Run44forrest> BBQ draculas ribs
[3:55:00] <+FlorianoAguirre> I think it was after the boss, but can't remember quite where
[3:55:17] <Crushter> @angriestpat yeah it was a little past the boss in a room
[3:55:20] <%RubberFistFight> @Crushter I think Pat has his DM's closed so he needs to initiate the convo.
[3:55:22] <Mendin> Oh, yeah, that one. It's near the shop
[3:55:28] <RyuuAoi> Crazy talk
[3:55:32] <Crushter> @rubberfistfight thanks
[3:55:42] <Skeledan> Is this Ghouls n Goblins
[3:55:56] <Crushter> @angriestpat yeah you missed the red wax bead as well, which is a rosary item
[3:56:01] <%RubberFistFight> @Crushter no worries :) Apparently he was getting a fuckton of shit he didn't want, so he did that. Which is fair.
[3:56:02] <%dukenux> this is Nuns and Goblets
[3:56:15] <+nekodelic> down
[3:56:20] <%Zaphire_Saucypants> hey, wasn't there a spike pit below those guys?
[3:56:21] <%RubberFistFight> @AngriestPat yeah, behind a candelabrum.
[3:56:33] <%Zaphire_Saucypants> outside, I mean
[3:56:37] <mostundesired> @Zaphire_Saucypants Don't tell him Kappa
[3:56:40] <lexiliat_33> is not in that area, s in the sewers
[3:57:03] <nycugz> not for xbox one, right?
[3:57:05] <Notterr> Deflecting is so satisfying in this game
[3:57:29] <%RubberFistFight> @nycugz this game? It's on everything, man
[3:57:31] <Crushter> @angriestpat tweeted you the comic and the red bead is behind va secretb wall
[3:57:36] <Crushter> in that area
[3:57:39] <bluecrayon203> well there is a lesser know story about Jesus fighting and slaying a dragon. The story of this epic battle was left out of the Bible due to it being too unbelievable.
[3:57:44] <+nekodelic> you got there after you bear the boss
[3:57:46] <McAngrimStein> chat is always right, even when they give different directions
[3:57:47] <nycugz> really? ok
[3:57:52] <Flyrant> is this a new game? Never heard of it
[3:57:52] <%RubberFistFight> @nycugz I got it on Switch, pat has it on PC, but it's also on PS4, Xbone, Linux and Mac.
[3:57:57] <mostundesired> @bluecrayon203 that's the one with the lance, right?
[3:58:05] <%RubberFistFight> @Flyrant yep, came out a week ago
[3:58:08] <Mendin> It's in the central shaft near the bottom pat, not these side areas
[3:58:15] <RyuuAoi> Crazy talk. I told you, Pat.
[3:58:19] <Crushter> it's in the main shaft
[3:58:21] <bear_breaker20> rember that time saint martha suplexed a dragon
[3:58:22] <bluecrayon203> I'm not sure I haven't looked into only heard about it.
[3:58:24] <%GabeSweetMan> It's so appreciated you can interrupt the mages.
[3:58:30] <%Dakuu75> is there a way to see stuff tweeted AT ppl, on THEIR twitter page?
[3:58:34] <Coystick> Heh, shaft
[3:58:37] <Hyphixsys> LUL
[3:58:49] <%RubberFistFight> I also appreciate how the enemies don't respawn when you room transition - ONLY when you bonfire
[3:58:51] <mostundesired> Nice
[3:58:56] <%RubberFistFight> @AngriestPat holy shit you missed it again LUL
[3:58:59] <%moogleboy1984> how the hell do you find these hard to find secrets, but miss the obvious ones
[3:59:00] <tuifuiegoeris> patphemous
[3:59:02] <Crushter> @dakuu75 if Pat retweets it it'll be easier to find than me linking my Twitter
[3:59:03] <Mendin> Remember you have that bead on that heals you a tiny amount when you break objets
[3:59:14] <nycugz> this looks pretty good
[3:59:14] <mostundesired> LUL
[3:59:16] <Hyphixsys> LUL
[3:59:18] <%Dakuu75> @Crushter right-right, I'll just wait for him to do that
[3:59:22] <+SamleyTimes> got it!
[3:59:40] <Mendin> You didnt yet
[3:59:41] <+RiceeFTW> i don't think you missed one

[3:59:49] <Notterr> vial are fountains, you will find in the future
[3:59:49] <Mendin> It's early in the sewer
[3:59:51] <+FlorianoAguirre> my bad, close to the sewers
[3:59:54] <Crushter> it's a health upgrade, not a bile room
[3:59:55] <%RubberFistFight> there's none in this zone
[3:59:58] <lexiliat_33> tou didn't
[3:59:59] <StarsCrusader> You didn't. It's in the sewer.

[4:00:28] <Crushter> sewers leads to the third path naturally
[4:00:29] <%Bt_Robot> Try that moss in a jar
[4:00:30] <+RiceeFTW> this way first

[4:00:34] <RyuuAoi> Third path. Save sewers!
[4:00:34] <+FlorianoAguirre> boss way is correct
[4:00:35] <%derekwst3> LEFT way
[4:00:37] <RavenMoonX> boss way
[4:00:38] <Flyrant> the way with the mist poop
[4:00:38] <Mendin> From piedad is proper
[4:00:39] <%RubberFistFight> Doesn't make a lot of difference utlimately
[4:00:42] <Thirtine> Boss Way
[4:00:43] <%RubberFistFight> but the boss way is "proper"
[4:00:43] <Notterr> boss way all da whey
[4:00:44] <+Order_of_Mystery> go back to visage, i think you missed stuff

[4:00:55] <$realm_forge> BOSS THAT SHIT UP
[4:00:56] <+SamleyTimes> doesnt make much difference
[4:00:57] <Crushter> @rubberfistfight well you can't explore the sewers from the secret way
[4:00:58] <%moogleboy1984> I know it's a game about Sins, but sometimes patience is a virtue

[4:07:45] <%tuifuiegoeris> drop your shield
[4:07:47] <Run44forrest> very grateful those poop drops only hurt you and dont knock you down

[4:16:38] <%dukenux> subtle
[4:16:38] <%trueGarnish> neat indeed
[4:16:39] <TwinBat> you think the devs might be DS fans?
