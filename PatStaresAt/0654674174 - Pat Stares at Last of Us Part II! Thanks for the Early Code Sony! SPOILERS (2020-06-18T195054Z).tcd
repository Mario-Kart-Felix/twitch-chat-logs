[0:02:38] <+ImpHelpSingIt> can you imagine if this is actually good LUL
[0:02:40] <%ChestMimik> Wouldn't it be funny if the game turned out to be great
[0:02:40] <Pizza_Mezza> Lol I got a last of us 2 ad as I clicked on this stream
[0:02:40] <SGrim> Well well well, looks like it's time for some "fun."

[0:02:59] <%Doruben> Î≤ÑÎπåÎ¶¨Ïó¥ÌïúÎ≤àÏß∏Î∞úÍ∞ÄÎùΩ subscribed at Tier 1. They've subscribed for 30 months! 
[0:03:01] <mach01_> plot twist: the leaks were all false to get publicity
[0:03:02] <+NitronStreams> What if its mostly fine tho?
[0:03:03] <%ragingbrachy> hot shots golf ft. joel and ellie
[0:03:03] <+michingmallecho> from all accounts the game is overall good. The story is dumb but video games
[0:03:04] <axelkaspar> Thing is, playing a challenging game with great controls, spectacle and tension is automatically fun
[0:03:05] <Vileosis> boom
[0:03:08] <evilaltruistic> is this the first Last Of Us stream he'll make?
[0:03:09] <%Typhaeon> Zombie apocalypse show but it's actually a generic soap opera
[0:03:15] <+sekirei04> My score for the game is 8/10 fingers
[0:03:16] <%Typhaeon> wait that's all of them
[0:03:17] <%Bailey__gaming> NO FUN ZONE
[0:03:19] <FullMetalEmblem> pog cant wait for true salt
[0:03:20] <%segonian> the gameplay will probably be good, and the story will be garbo
[0:03:23] <%ChestMimik> "F is for fire that BURNS DOWN THE WHOLE TOWN" - The Last of Us 2
[0:03:26] <axelkaspar> Saying "We want to make a great game but no fun allowed" sort of aggravates people apparently

[0:03:32] <%WornTrigger> WornTrigger subscribed at Tier 1. They've subscribed for 18 months! Don't usually catch live streams, but there's no way I'd miss this shitshow.

[0:03:49] <Hanyusha> If you guys are having fun I will report you to Sony
[0:03:51] <RoboFussin> For real though, I thought this wasn't out for another 5 hours. Nice surprise :)
[0:03:51] <%OldManDeckardCain> gameplay wise this game is practically identical to the first LUL
[0:03:52] <Thetruestblacksun> Plankton!
[0:03:53] <%Bailey__gaming> im ready for some spoiling of long walks
[0:03:53] <uncledoodsauce> @axelkaspar I'm probably going to hate the game even more if it's false.
[0:03:54] <%derap41> Holy shit Pat got it?
[0:03:58] <+sekirei04> N is for no fun
[0:04:00] <%ekodrop> psaBlep
[0:04:00] <+nathandiel> Fun is for nintendo
[0:04:02] <joshua_42> Can‚Äôt wait to see Neil Fuckman‚Äôs self insert spit on Joel‚Äôs grave
[0:04:04] <$milhousego> did pat get an early copy, or is the game just out?
[0:04:05] <mach01_> it turns out the game is just guitar hero with ellie as the avatar
[0:04:05] <axelkaspar> I have read books that were depressing but very very good.
[0:04:06] <+Agentoracle> 8 - I forget what 8 was for
[0:04:07] <%Ganerumo> This game is fucking trash and wants you to believe you are trash, so for the sake of all of you, remember that you are loved and appreciated
[0:04:09] <%Doruben> You can (Not) play golf
[0:04:12] <digimonda> oh man a tlou2 ad on this stream

[0:04:28] <%DesertPenguin> Press X to Feel Emotions
[0:04:29] <axelkaspar> I have seen movies with horrible, sad endings that were really good. Games don't have to be "fun" if they bring quality
[0:04:29] <%Typhaeon> Dude gots the code
[0:04:31] <Hanyusha> @Ganerumo hey thanks man, I love you too
[0:04:32] <%Hopit> Thanks for the PrideFloat @worntrigger
[0:04:34] <%ringabal> I can't believe Pat got Sponsored by Sony for this
[0:04:35] <mamabedlam> Time to stare at Niel Snuffman's spank bank
[0:04:39] <@SoFarFetched> If anyone has fun in here,there's gonna be paddling's handed out psaSmug

[0:04:47] <%Nickmobox> Time to smell some farts
[0:04:48] <+michingmallecho> I think calling a game trash is weird. Unless it fails on gameplay, visuals, and story‚Äôs then a game is trash...IMO.
[0:04:52] <diego_andres> I sure gonna enjoy this while eating my BIGOT SANDWICH
[0:04:52] <uncledoodsauce> @yummy_nukes you know pat gets review copies for free right?
[0:04:52] <%ChestMimik> How did Pat get permission to stream this early anyways?
[0:04:54] <%Niney_Who> I like how pat talked shit about the game on twitter and still got an early code LUL
[0:04:56] <%optimasmaximas> see chat, i wasnt lying about farfetched üò°
[0:04:59] <%DesertPenguin> I gotta go out for a bit so hopefully we get donations and bits for 30 minutes
[0:05:03] <%DesertPenguin> Don't wanna miss anything
[0:05:04] <+nathandiel> Time to make pot pie
[0:05:04] <@SoFarFetched> Sony let pat play earlier
[0:05:05] <%derap41> Who did Pat murder to get a code?
[0:05:06] <+NinjaWitaSniper> YALL READY FOR THIS FUCKING TRAINWRECK?
[0:05:07] <Hanyusha> Going to make some bigot coffee
[0:05:09] <%segonian> give me druckman balls
[0:05:10] <Angry_Ev1L> @ChestMimik sony wants him to review this game Kappa
[0:05:11] <sunflowyr> i dont normally watch streams live but i need to see pats reaction to this game
[0:05:13] <RoboFussin> I'm a house Neil Duckman fan, so everyone please be nice
[0:05:17] <%liflamor> psaDab
[0:05:20] <$Dakuu75> @ChestMimik He jsut got an e-mail from sony saying he could, is all I know.
[0:05:22] <+zanzibar_junker> Japanese vtubers can't stream this because of the sex scenes
[0:05:27] <%Bailey__gaming> Im Playing Fight's In Tight Spaces and that game is RAD AS FUCK and super fun i cant wait for the full version beat the demo 5 times
[0:05:29] <%Typhaeon> I would take Jason Alexander over Neil Druckmann
[0:05:30] <roninko_real> lit
[0:05:31] <%DesertPenguin> Blurry nipples
[0:05:31] <diego_andres> Hey don't forget Bigot Sugar in the Coffee
[0:05:34] <mach01_> i think sony has carefully calculated that by giving pat a key like 9 hours before the unlock time he won't get to the shitty part in time and his dumb fans will buy it. 8d chess
[0:05:34] <@SoFarFetched> Sony was like "Please insult Hell Fuckman more,we'll give you this code to play on sat-wait shit no that's too late,PLAY TUESDAY"
[0:05:38] <Venchair> the sex scene are awful
[0:05:38] <%BoneofMalkav> LUL
[0:05:39] <%Typhaeon> As Neil Duckman
[0:05:44] <KongrawDarts> First time really catching a stream, looking forward to this.
[0:05:45] <knyttstories> calebKek I spoiled the ending for myself yesterday, this is going to be a trip
[0:05:47] <@SoFarFetched> WEdnesday* LUL
[0:05:48] <Yummy_Nukes> @uncledoodsauce latter day saints always give me free pamphlets, don't mean i gotta read it
[0:05:49] <%FluffiTamamo> A round of applause for Pat for taking the bullet for the rest of us. psaUp
[0:05:49] <roninko_real> Time for me to super not play the game and just enjoy Pat play it
[0:05:50] <Venchair> they legit don't know how to end a scene and just have sex
[0:05:55] <Venchair> it's wild
[0:05:55] <%ragingbrachy> we all know the ending PepeLaugh
[0:05:55] <%Nope80808> I hope Pat didnt jump the gun with this stream. Sony gonna come in with the hammer and kneecap his ass.
[0:05:58] <roninko_real> Not gonna lie, I am super excited
[0:06:03] <$Sphincter_Spelunker> Sony Twitter DMCA'd by Sony
[0:06:04] <Hanyusha> I want Pat to voice over the sex scenes
[0:06:04] <%de1ete_forever> i dont know the ending
[0:06:05] <$Dakuu75> We gonna get dumped into Sub mode if ya'll are dropping spoilers all ready
[0:06:06] <@SoFarFetched> @Nope80808 he got allowed to by Sony

[0:06:32] <@SoFarFetched> @Agami23 oh no it's worse
[0:06:38] <mach01_> just asking because people will absolutely drop spoilers and he will see them.
[0:06:40] <%devanmuse> Question about these early codes for streamers: is there some clause in the agreement forbidding you from SHITTING ON the game if it's hot garbage? No real reason why I'm asking today of all days...
[0:06:40] <Katalist_> Anyone up for a round of golf?
[0:06:41] <uncledoodsauce> @yummy_nukes a world where pat doesn't shit on terrible games is a boring one.
[0:06:41] <Hanyusha> No spoilers, I want every pain to be genuine
[0:06:44] <Angry_Ev1L> @marvel877 implying he didn't read all the spoilers already
[0:06:44] <%deadredeyez> to ph and back

[0:07:29] <warmnoid> tlou2 felt like it was written by what a 13 year old thinks a mature story is like
[0:07:30] <mach01_> @devanmuse i don't think there is for streamers, pat wouldn't agree to that because he'd just wait a day lul. but games media sites are fully in devs/publishers pockets and even their 'bad' reviews are tame

Numerous hip hop artists have used it in their songs, in Kid Ink's "Bad Ass" song, he raps "Now then let me see that cake, cake, cake, like Entenmann's - Ass up, gon' take it down like a sedative."

[0:37:09] <oniwahoo> It's the human response, but it's not the right answer
[0:37:09] <DCDrewZee> Joel Did Nothing Wrong.

[0:37:14] <%otakon17> I AGREE WITH IT TOO
[0:37:14] <+A123yourdead> But Joel's is a bad guy!
[0:37:14] <Darksolerino> JOEL DID NOTHING WRONG
[0:37:15] <BourneWarrior> MIGHT HAVE MADE
[0:37:15] <ManfredA> THEY TRIED IT BEFORE
[0:37:15] <jijipose> Joel's only mistake was not killing more
[0:37:15] <JerZeyCJ> what kind of asshole DOESN'T agree with joel's decision?
[0:37:15] <burstaxe> there was a possibility not a definite
[0:37:15] <%derap41> Joel did the wrong thing but you beleive he thinks its right

[0:38:08] <%DGenerator> possible
[0:38:10] <mach01_> HE DEAD
[0:38:10] <%derap41> If Ellie had Known Joel would have been the bad guy
[0:38:11] <DE777ON> joel wick
[0:38:13] <%Reveresao> SHE DID NOT CONSENT
[0:38:13] <agustorm123> WutFace WutFace
[0:38:14] <%Conyst> why does he look older in that cutscene than in the original game
[0:38:14] <Dao_Puppy> She knew though, the whole point of the ending scene is that she KNEW.
[0:38:14] <pennykettle_> I can!
[0:38:14] <+BIumen> wow i hate this already
[0:38:15] <%Movemeister> Was it a maybe?
[0:38:15] <generalve> @PatStaresAt an audio diary in the hosiptial said they killed multiple kids and IT DIDNT WORK
[0:38:16] <%joshua_42> I started blasting
[0:38:16] <%LiquidDinosaur> @SolidusRex wait sorry that was his friend
[0:38:16] <+Swish20XX> This looks good
[0:38:16] <%ChestMimik> Didn't she know it was going to kill her?
[0:38:18] <+OwlLightningMage> They also found other infected people and didn't make a cure
[0:38:18] <illtima> Nah, Ellie realised what she signed up for
[0:38:18] <Dumple_Roe> The butt part is the better deal for a potential cure
[0:38:18] <pompous_ostrich> NO CONSENT FORM WAS FILLED
[0:38:19] <WaifusSansFrontieres> this whole story relies on you thinking this is wrong
[0:38:20] <mach01_> WHAT IF THE CHILD CONSENTS?
[0:38:21] <%barrakuta371> Pat "You can't be scooping kids' brains out!"
[0:38:22] <Halospaz117> What a sentence
[0:38:22] <jijipose> Not with that attitude
[0:38:22] <+Deekman> Why would you tell ANYONE that she's immune
[0:38:24] <jbrowning134> if it saves all of humanity then why not?
[0:38:24] <%chiazamformerlymankeyfigh> !uptime
[0:38:25] <%cowardman93> the cure wasn't even a maybe, it was a "we've tried so many times and got NOWHERE"
[0:38:25] <@Moobot> I've been playing this game for how long? Oh only 38m 33s.
[0:38:25] <Ipsenscastle> for real
[0:38:27] <nobody12349> Joel did nothing wrong
[0:38:27] <+necrocannibal2> @patstaresat AND SHE WASNT EVEN THE ONLY IMMUNE PERSON
[0:38:27] <BisoromiBear> BUT THE GOOD OLD DAYS AFTER 9/11
[0:38:28] <%gespenst25> PAT WE ARE MAD SCIENTISTS AND WE ARE GOING TO DO MAD SCIENCE.
[0:38:29] <%otakon17> They never told her the procedure would kill her
[0:38:29] <%FluffiTamamo> Lookit that dead doctor that not everyone killed in the first game
[0:38:29] <biggdaddymike> biggdaddymike subscribed at Tier 1. 
[0:38:31] <+evbites> children can't consent
[0:38:31] <Yummy_Nukes> I WOULDN'T TRUST A RAG TAG BUNCH OF MISFITS TO MAKE A PAINKILLER LET ALONE A ZOMBIE CURE
[0:38:31] <%Pookiedaexzile> BRUH
[0:38:32] <%Valdorick> Hot Take - these guys all suck if ONE GUY killed them all. I wouldn't trust them with a cure. They'd shit their pants and somehow manage to ruin the cure anyway.
[0:38:33] <OneThousandTomatoes> OR THEIR PARENTS MAKE CONSENT
[0:38:34] <Profmcstevie> They LIED to a child and were going to kill her for a "maybe"
[0:38:34] <%kiiiirsten> more like the last of us part POO!!!!! This game sucked I'm so ready for Part DEUX
[0:38:34] <%Taisuru> You can't just cut kids butts off without their consent dude
[0:38:35] <Infantry762> Joel was ight
[0:38:38] <yeetdabsenpai69> Fuck 'em
[0:38:38] <%DGenerator> Then he lied.
[0:38:38] <JiggyWithIt74> Wait, were't they supposed to be singing in this ending?
[0:38:39] <%Kataguro> Yeah he does
[0:38:39] <HellboundHeartless> I didn't actually finish the first game, I thought the cure was a sure thing
[0:38:39] <EndlessScrapper> And further more I do not care about that doctor. THe game gives you know choice to kill him. Simply walking forward kills him
[0:38:40] <%derap41> ok that settles is Joel did nothing wrong
[0:38:40] <agustorm123> Pretty much it won‚Äôt work
[0:38:40] <bigdrewYT> What is this pointless recap?
[0:38:40] <+full_cowl> @PatStaresAt is Ellie's nickname still garbage?
[0:38:40] <JiggyWithIt74> hahahha
[0:38:40] <%crimsonharvest> so he was tricked into delivering her to be murdered?
[0:38:41] <CherrieVelvet> but humanity tho
[0:38:41] <socratetris> Ellie knew she was goinf to die. It is subtle, but it is demonstrated in the game.
[0:38:41] <%stagemage> you cant KEEP cutting kids brains out
[0:38:41] <+OwlLightningMage> Joel totally made the right choice
[0:38:43] <+moonseas4> he forgot about the audio file LUL
[0:38:43] <+Deekman> #JoelWasRight
[0:38:43] <DeeVee_TV> Fireflies are fuck ups, there is no way they would have made one succesfully and actually distributed it
[0:38:43] <%Pookiedaexzile> Because the Game SAYS SO SHUT
[0:38:44] <JustAnotherMuffin> @patstaresat But Joel also doesn't give Ellie a choice. He makes that decision for her.
[0:38:45] <%Pookiedaexzile> UP
[0:38:45] <+metal_gearxxx> is that the cum chalice?
[0:38:45] <%CookieCutter007> he's old and tired
[0:38:46] <BaslerJones> YOU CAN
[0:38:46] <collind99> @fluffitamamo you have to kill that 1 doctor
[0:38:46] <burstaxe> with all available evidence we know it's the more correct decision
[0:38:48] <brachydios777> Joel was right
[0:38:48] <%flechet> also she wasnt immune just infected with another strain they new nothing about
[0:38:49] <%thelonechris> LUL
[0:38:49] <jbrowning134> All of humanity > one child
[0:38:50] <%ragingbrachy> not the butts, no
[0:38:50] <OneThousandTomatoes> clip it
[0:38:50] <Baelthar> cut the butt
[0:38:51] <collind99> wait no
[0:38:51] <$Dakuu75> STOP
[0:38:52] <mach01_> @FluffiTamamo nah, you had to kill that guy, he tries to stab you, but the others in the room could live.
[0:38:52] <SchroedingersFerret> Nobody ever thought to try antifungals
[0:38:54] <OneAboveAll> Thanks for the PrideWorld @biggdaddymike
[0:38:54] <Psyramics> I thought he died at the end? I never finished the game but that was the vibe I got from the Internet
[0:38:54] <+rosabellamelantha> ELLIE KNEW
[0:38:55] <DE777ON> no touch kids
[0:38:55] <%derap41> Phrasing

[0:39:10] <+SuicidalLemmming> Already with the retcons for the first game
[0:39:10] <%FluffiTamamo> I mean can't you just whack him with a blunt melee or something?
[0:39:10] <yeetdabsenpai69> good
[0:39:11] <+The_Butterfly_Man> well I mean there is still the hope that it could have worked I guess'
[0:39:11] <%CrazyRainbows> Especially not when every other attempt failed terribly. Why keep doing the same shit over and over again expecting the outcome to be different
[0:39:12] <shatteredglass4> what if they have buttitis
[0:39:12] <madejustforchat> its like MGS rising LUL

[0:42:28] <%Corporate_Redeemer> I still 100% believe that if they wanted a sequel that they shouldn't have kept joel or ellie as the mc
[0:42:29] <%de1ete_forever> psaBig STOP
[0:42:30] <+Dova573> one guy
[0:42:30] <%ragingbrachy> hi im joel :)

[0:42:31] <%Midashu> STOP HAVING FUN
[0:42:31] <%Giggalith> No fun, only suffering

[0:42:31] <Halospaz117> STOP
[0:42:32] <BalloniWright> don't use the f-word pat cmonBruh
[0:42:32] <%ringabal> STOP HAVING FUN says the sign
[0:42:32] <%Razputin217> No Fun Allowed
[0:42:33] <+TombstoneTTromboners> The audio log actually says Ellie was the first immune person they found. They just experimented on other infected subjects.
[0:42:33] <pennykettle_> thats the sign telling you to TOP having fun
[0:42:33] <agustorm123> Where is the fun tho
[0:42:34] <KongrawDarts> Getting Metal Gear vibes
[0:42:35] <+kenji_not_genji> Stop having fun chainbKEK
[0:42:36] <+biodomewithpaulyshor> I was gonna say that's impossible
[0:42:36] <ape_hawk> "I'm Joel, the big murder-man!"
[0:42:37] <WhatzePh> When does the dog killing and feeling bad about it start?
[0:42:38] <jorniev> PAT MORE FUN
[0:42:38] <%spiritofmojave> NO FUN!
[0:42:39] <+krymzen5> at least its gorgeous
[0:42:39] <collind99> removing a small audio log because it accidentally fucks up your plot is absolutely justified
[0:42:40] <%1matheuw> one guyS strick again
[0:42:40] <artoflec> are there any Collectibles elaWOW
[0:42:40] <MrDante7> @otakon17 they weren't immune, ellie was the only one immune, they just tried to reverse engineer from people who became infected
[0:42:41] <EndlessScrapper> THERE IS NO NARRATIVE! Killing a innocent for a chance a super low chance at that to possibly treat a diease is not a morally grey thing. Its still evil!
[0:42:41] <cipher758> go chat. rip and tear until it's done
[0:42:41] <%DGenerator> "I wanted it to be true, so I said an unverified feeling as fact lol"
[0:42:42] <%PlumpPotatoRump> Jesse with Three E's? Jessee, I won'der if that name was a typo O_O
[0:42:45] <Halospaz117> THAT WAS LESS SUBTLE THAN FUCKING SPEC OPS NEIL
[0:42:45] <%mullsey> Even if they haden't had otehr test subjects, the first thing you do to study an immunity and develop a cure is NOT to kill the only person you know is immune. There are months and months of tests to do before critical tissue removal
[0:42:46] <ennnnnnd> a sign that says STOP HAVING FUN
[0:42:48] <%otakon17> ah
[0:42:49] <sweglord5000> Joel of Tsushima
[0:42:49] <$Dakuu75> WOW a sign that says "identify yourself" instead of "PREPAIR TO GET SHOT"
[0:42:51] <%SirGO0SE> we're gonna send pat to fun jail BOP
[0:42:51] <+StrawberryPantsu> At least the game is pretty
[0:42:52] <%JJCheeker> It's too bad Neil had the f*** this game
[0:42:52] <%weissguard> They expanded that territory in the time jump, huh?
[0:42:53] <ammobasket> BARDS COMIN THRU
[0:42:53] <%LiquidDinosaur> @otakon17 and they removed it it because they didnt want to make Joel's choice seem objectively right?
[0:42:53] <CesarPlaysLive> Thanks for the PrideHeartR @superc37 pumped up, cant wait to see Pat play this!!!!!!!!
[0:42:54] <kindashagg> Every place like this is doomed immediately
[0:42:54] <+OwlLightningMage> When do we get to dog murder LUL
[0:42:55] <RinWR> You have twenty seconds to comply
[0:42:55] <+Walopoh> it makes a cool cinematic intro with no dialogue
[0:43:00] <$heyitskevin> In the PS4 version of the game Neville Longbottom got retconned into an anti-vaxxer
[0:43:00] <%kiiiirsten> @patstaresat fuck you for having fun. poignant moments only.
[0:43:00] <benjiFG> gustavo wooo
[0:43:00] <+JustToWatch> Only Joel could have such a murderous aura
[0:43:02] <%Valdorick> That horse will die off screen
[0:43:02] <Infantry762> ok
[0:43:03] <dukenux> I thought everyone knows The Joel by now
[0:43:04] <waddle_dee1992> FEELINGS
[0:43:04] <%Purple_badger3000> Joel doesn't need to identify himself, he just needs to stab women
[0:43:05] <JonnyJug> RDR2?
[0:43:05] <%JJCheeker> Looks like a lot of work was put into it
[0:43:06] <%crimsonharvest> thank your horse
[0:43:06] <%otakon17> @LiquidDinosaur yeah
[0:43:07] <HarmlessCrow> @PatStaresAt Pat you realise that by buying into the negativity of this game, you have deprived yourself of having fun playing it, and are ONLY MAKING DRUKMAN STRONGER

[1:17:06] <%otakon17> @PatStaresAt it doesn't, the Runners freeze to death but the cordyceps just goes dormant and then reactivates in the warmer weather, thus spreading itself.
[1:17:07] <%xcompleasedad> THAT WAS THE SECOND BEST PART
[1:17:07] <+asaoirc> punch that zombie in the face, get that spore juice all over your knuckles
[1:17:08] <+JenovasPuppet> No time for multiplayer, there's FEELINGS to be had!

[1:22:15] <+Radalorian> Listen Pat, they had to watch a ton of LiveLeak vids to get that sound effect just right
[1:22:15] <$D4C_Trice> Man Joel used to choke people out but the neck snapping really just nasty
[1:22:15] <%DappercatEsquire> most people suck shit
[1:22:15] <%Purple_badger3000> Maybe she's just a great chiropractor
[1:22:16] <%Dragovus> But Naughty Dog doesn't have crunch

[1:22:23] <+Kataiser> Paid to watch Liveleak so that your neck snap cronches just right
[1:22:23] <%otakon17> I think Abby is different, she's paramilitary trained basically

[1:44:29] <Russiandeathstroke> Why would the Cordyceps virus care about a moose? They can‚Äôt become infected, and isn‚Äôt this virus motivated just by spreading itself rather than eating?

[1:45:08] <Sklauda1> I would not be surprised if they both got into the shower and just ritualistically peed on each other when they both have to go. They see it as a sign.

[1:46:11] <collind99> @plainsimpletailor because people complaining about a trans character (who isn‚Äôt even trans) especially when they use transphobic words, are bigots
[1:46:19] <%LiquidDinosaur> @atomicdrokan oh of course. Remember when they talked about the Kinect patent where the Xbox would spray Mtn Dew in your eyes until you got up and shouted MCDONALDS
[1:46:24] <%ragingbrachy> we dont need emote only

[1:47:14] <%PlainSimpleTailor> @collind99 That comes at the expense of the characters that they already know and are attached to. Also, how do they have the resources in the post apocalypse 20 yrs on

[1:47:24] <calamarvelous> ITS THE PEEPEE MAN
[1:47:26] <C4m3r0n0409> Strawman argument about the trans people. People don't like the fact the main character of the first game is killed unceremoniously
[1:47:28] <%MSN04_Sazabi> Abby could be a Japanese schoolgirl or a 6 foot tall black man, I don't think it would change the opinion on her very much
[1:47:28] <Poncho_Freestyle> yay time for more painful flirting
[1:47:29] <Noeralf31> Heal Fuckman, the lost Death Stranding character

[1:48:28] <%ChestMimik> Yes, climb in through the bloody window
[1:48:30] <%Prism_Wing> It's just ugly sex going on in there. Not infected!
[1:48:31] <%joshua_42> IS BLUDD
[1:48:31] <%PlainSimpleTailor> @collind99 Okay, so my point still stands. They are deprived of the characters they like, and are forced to 'like' someone completely new
[1:48:32] <pennykettle_> do not split up
[1:48:33] <Russiandeathstroke> Does Neil Druckmann have a buff woman fetish? Because there was a really buff lady in uncharted 4 too
[1:48:34] <xxyoloswagins420xx> @patstaresat Are you streaming the EA Play later?
[1:48:35] <%ogtrashwizard> Why do we not just leave
[1:48:35] <%Campfire_Chronicles> aren't they just scouts? why not go back and report this then come back with reinforcements?
[1:48:37] <%OhioNitsud> dina gonna die
[1:48:37] <Dr_Mooose> yeah split up
[1:48:40] <%czeekyplays> "Hey kids, do you see where the runners went?" - Dina the Explorer

[1:49:06] <%tigerfang86> BIG KNIFINGS
[1:49:06] <%dekkitout> @czeekyplays I read that as Dora the Explorer
[1:49:09] <%gespenst25> The worst part of TLOU1 was if you didn't shoot all the time you got no ammo drops so you could never build much up
[1:49:10] <roman6621> killing zombies is wrong
[1:49:12] <%aBlueWizard> Wanting to be dommed by strong VVomen.
[1:49:13] <%dan_g_v> Is Pat being a big influencer and that's how he got the game?
[1:49:14] <%gstut1> oh no i feel so bad, they use to be a person

[1:50:23] <gabagoosh> they seem more like regular zombies. where are the shrooms?
[1:50:23] <%ChestMimik> He probably wasn't a runner before it was barricaded. it's not rocket science

[2:00:25] <canadadan55> dust particles look nice
[2:00:25] <OneThousandTomatoes> Wait, does nobody grow beards because of the masks?
[2:00:26] <ManfredA> so like wouldn't gas masks be completely useless since spores are a particulate and not a gas
[2:00:26] <+Deekman> if they've been going on patrol for 4 years how are they just finding it now
[2:00:26] <+incarnation_of_filth> nurgles blessing :)

[2:01:04] <jorniev> SPORE WAS SUCH A BAD GAME LOL
[2:01:05] <Ids560> I feel like letting everyone know that she's immune would be useful info so she doesn't waste masks and filters
[2:01:05] <SolGainer> prolly still doesn't smell good
[2:01:06] <%valriot> SHE DOESNT KNOW THAT
[2:01:06] <+Nahkc> further demonstrating mushrooms are gross

[2:04:54] <%Chimeraelite> Well yea they've had time to forge or find actual quality blades
[2:04:55] <+NitronStreams> is that the "echolocation" monster?
[2:04:55] <teflonbilly777> Single use shivs was the worst
[2:04:56] <+necrocannibal2> JESUS, DINA'S NOSE ALMOST CAN'T FIT IN THE MASK
[2:04:57] <%Nope80808> Oh it aint one use?
[2:04:58] <Wan6Saber> @galaxyswirl she wants to hide her advantage

[2:05:01] <Profmcstevie> Ellie had a permanent knife, she fucked up clickers
[2:05:01] <%dinnydanny777> It's so dumb that they didn't hear that
[2:05:02] <%derap41> That was so dumb you needed scissors to kill them when you had a knife
[2:05:02] <+Nahkc> not these fuckers jnbWut
[2:05:03] <%linSP> woah does Ellie have a C pass
[2:05:08] <%galaxyswirl> @Wan6Saber aaaaahhhh
[2:05:11] <%ChestMimik> It's not echolocation but it's consistent with the last ge
[2:05:12] <%jiin6> though now if they grab you...instant desu
[2:05:12] <Ace_Flibble> Ellie already got all the Mr Raccoons
[2:05:12] <katocrimson> cos joel never had knife. knife was ellie's deal
[2:05:12] <%galaxyswirl> thats dumb
[2:05:13] <Lutre> THEY HEAR, AND THEN THEY SEE
[2:05:14] <Gruhunchously> Clickers? In this game? I thought that HUMANS were the real monsters...I'll shut up now.
[2:05:14] <pennykettle_> I think the consumable shiv idea is good, keeps you afraid
[2:05:15] <Hanyusha> But they have super good hearing
[2:05:15] <%chiazamformerlymankeyfigh> @PatStaresAt You can KILL CLICKERS FROM THE FRONT, BECAUSE THEY CAN'T SEE

[2:05:35] <$Sphincter_Spelunker> they click then they see
[2:05:36] <@SoFarFetched> Ellie's like hiding the zombie bite,except add on the fact that she's immune to the zombie bite.

[2:05:49] <%CookieCutter007> pretty hot
[2:05:50] <%ragingbrachy> that one had a fat ass though
[2:05:50] <%de1ete_forever> so stealth
[2:05:50] <%valriot> F U N
[2:05:51] <%DesertPenguin> Don't put your hands there!
[2:05:51] <%hzealot> clickers are like the wendigos in until dawn
[2:05:51] <eyezehuhh> Shiv hunting was stressfull
[2:05:52] <OpenMikeLive> LIGHTING
[2:05:52] <muniea3> go to the eye doctor Paige
[2:05:53] <%derap41> Yeah someone is going to make porn out of these dudes
[2:05:53] <%ceriani1234> HER FUCKING HAND
[2:05:54] <%rosemon5001> PAT GET A KNIFE she will attack at night @PatStaresAt
[2:05:55] <%Kataguro> Why would it care about its throat?
[2:05:55] <%Valdorick> THAT SEEMS LIKE A REALLY BAD IDEA
[2:05:57] <Phoenon> Yeah just put your hand on a clicker's face
[2:05:57] <bluebiscuit94> SAME ANIMATION
[2:05:57] <+Magister135> It's the same animation!
[2:05:59] <%spiritofmojave> That sounded very not silent LUL
[2:06:00] <+Matto424> Shove a hand in the mushroom hole
[2:06:01] <Poncho_Freestyle> stealth kills from the front huh?
[2:06:03] <HannibalBeerus> THE FLASHLIGHT WENT THROUGH HER
[2:06:03] <+Merhabi> what
[2:06:03] <+Tempacco> same ANIMATION for EVERY KILL
[2:06:04] <BoborRUU> the knife makes these enemies trivial
[2:06:04] <agrippaarpeggio> this is just how I sound in the morning
[2:06:05] <Ace_Flibble> Why would you put your hand right in the gross face part, even to get a stealth kill?
[2:06:05] <Ipsenscastle> The fact that they get echolocation so wrong is bizarre to me, because actual echolocation would make a fine game mechanic too
[2:06:06] <%LiquidDinosaur> do norrmal infected and clickers bother each other
[2:06:07] <+Ocaz> your days gone
[2:06:07] <teflonbilly777> How does a slit throat kil teh Clickers?
[2:06:07] <$Sphincter_Spelunker> @derap41 7 years too late, my man
[2:06:07] <%DesertPenguin> You got a one bullet
[2:06:07] <+DZiffer> you clicked your last
[2:06:07] <omen_setter> put your hand right over their face hole
[2:06:08] <%ChestMimik> Guys don't bang the clickers please you will die
[2:06:08] <+BigWhoopMagazine> did she shove her hand in it's mouth thing?
[2:06:09] <+Shady_Zaku> let me just SHOVE MY HAND IN YOUR FUNGUS FACE
[2:06:09] <lessthanhuman_tv> only dreams now
[2:06:09] <%Nope80808> She put her hand in the hole mouth
[2:06:10] <%dinnydanny777> Why does stabbing even kill them like that
[2:06:12] <%floralkami> @kataguro the spine is there
[2:06:13] <+Solutha> so do they just burn their clothes after this
[2:06:14] <am_omega> Ew
[2:06:18] <Gruhunchously> Nice to see a teaser of all that realistic gore we're going to be seeing.
[2:06:18] <Kiraklene> LUL
[2:06:19] <Moonlight_Grimoire> good thing she wear's gloves.
[2:06:19] <%galaxyswirl> did...did she just stick her whole fist down that clickers throat?
[2:06:19] <R3c0n31> Imagine touching them. Kicking giving me EWs
[2:06:20] <%dinnydanny777> Why is stabbing more fatal than shooting them
[2:06:21] <katocrimson> u can throw bottle to misdirect them
[2:06:21] <%derap41> @Sphincter_Spelunker I wouldn't know
[2:06:22] <+redhandedbee> You gotta kill a clicker via butt
[2:06:23] <%spiritofmojave> they do seem sorta trivial now
[2:06:23] <+mattiabh> this looks easy
[2:06:24] <seamoosethemoose> Ooo! Items!
[2:06:25] <ashenjuan25> Shoot Paige in the face she‚Äôs turned
[2:06:28] <%floralkami> @dinnydanny777 again, the spine is there
[2:06:31] <%spiritofmojave> true
[2:06:32] <biomegabear> jesus joel
[2:06:32] <+Radalorian> Now man is the most dangerous enemy
[2:06:33] <%Mitchellsocks> 10 years of dealing with them i guess
[2:06:33] <%LiquidDinosaur> @dinnydanny777 something something thick chitin armor
[2:06:36] <SGrim> And now they're just time consuming. :clock:
[2:06:36] <%DesertPenguin> WHy do you even have to deal with them? Just get to the fucking exit
[2:06:37] <Sklauda1> dad rage
[2:06:39] <Noeralf31> zambambos aren't the focus anymore, so why make any of 'em dangerous
[2:06:39] <%de1ete_forever> clothes are fine, don't worry about it
[2:06:41] <teflonbilly777> Joel was too big sad
[2:06:43] <OneThousandTomatoes> clickity clackity this shit is whackity
[2:06:43] <+krymzen5> i imagine with a few normal zombies they still are
[2:06:43] <%Kataguro> @floralkami But the fungus can still use everything above that part of the spinal cord, unless she's just stabbing the brain stem
[2:06:44] <+Shady_Zaku> vargLUL vargLUL vargLUL
[2:06:45] <%gespenst25> You didn't HAVE to shiv them you could also beat them to death with a brick.
[2:06:45] <%Valdorick> Knives are lost tech.
[2:06:46] <%dinnydanny777> Yeah but it takes two shots to the skull to kill them
[2:06:46] <%DappercatEsquire> NEVER?
[2:06:46] <%derap41> Joel really likes using Half scissors
[2:06:47] <%Purple_badger3000> Joel likes the more visceral feel of a shiv because he's a murderer
[2:06:48] <dukenux> Kappa
[2:06:49] <%DGenerator> EVEN IF SHE TURNED?
[2:06:49] <%jiin6> Pat loves his Shroom paige
[2:06:52] <urbana_venandi> I guess good knives were in short supply
[2:06:52] <jorniev> INTO THE GAR BAGEEE WITH YOU
[2:06:53] <gyro_gogo_zeppeli> i meaaaan
[2:06:54] <%tolloponik> Hershey bar on the ground
[2:06:55] <lessthanhuman_tv> honestly why did they even go in when they saw spores instead of just lighting the building up
[2:06:56] <$Jetfandam> Joel relieved his days in prison. Use the shiv!
[2:06:57] <%ragingbrachy> DansGame
[2:06:57] <%DesertPenguin> EXACTLY
[2:06:59] <KeiPrime> Grabbing zombies by the face like that you'd be surprised she hasnt lost a finger or two by now HahaBaby
[2:07:00] <+NinjaWitaSniper> @PatStaresAt I think it was because he lived in a military zone and having weapons was bad
[2:07:00] <%dinnydanny777> Sure the spine is there but it takes two bullets to the head for them to die
[2:07:00] <%possumwalsh1221> Yea cover it‚Äôs clicky mouth
[2:07:01] <%DesertPenguin> SO DUMB
[2:07:02] <+garbotrasho> so realistic wow
[2:07:02] <%chiazamformerlymankeyfigh> Now that you have INFINITE SHIV, and you can stealth kill FROM THE FRONT, who even cares?
[2:07:03] <%PlainSimpleTailor> Paige, you're mistaking yourself with Jason Schreier
[2:07:04] <%CookieCutter007> LUL Ellie's eye
[2:07:05] <Dingo_Eejit> ll the good knives got panic bought
[2:07:06] <%Nope80808> EXACTLy
[2:07:07] <Solidnick18> D:
[2:07:08] <%Dfreddy8> She's got that Triple H nose.
[2:07:08] <%Chimeraelite> Knives were probably hoarded to all hell where Joel was if they can take multiple clickers
[2:07:08] <%blackbaron98> Violence is up
[2:07:08] <%DesertPenguin> But why put your hand in that puss hole?
[2:07:08] <MonstarGrrrl> no you don't paige
[2:07:09] <%bluefooddye1> No time to make unique animations
[2:07:09] <%DGenerator> The infinite number of shiv makes clearing clickers WAY easier.
[2:07:11] <%ragingbrachy> 4Head
[2:07:12] <redlanternreviews> Putting you hand anywhere near the face seems like the worst thing you could possibly do
[2:07:13] <+Merhabi> Joel is not a smart man.
[2:07:15] <%snow_bush> Pat would never shoot a blind woman
[2:07:16] <+artyom47> the fffuck outta here
[2:07:16] <am_omega> WHY YOU STICKING HAND IN ICKY MUSHROOM VAGOO?
[2:07:17] <+DZiffer> why do Ellie's eyes roll back when she kills?
[2:07:18] <+Shubreaker> just grab their shoulders
[2:07:20] <%derap41> Its like with Bears you shove your arm down their throats to stop them from biting you
[2:07:20] <%MisterTylerrr> cause it's a recycled animatiom
[2:07:21] <BurdRightsActivist> this wasn't a FUN gameplay segment
[2:07:22] <Them00n> Wouldn't killing one of these things completely cover you in spores?
[2:07:22] <Phoenon> Jpeg Doctor PogChamp
[2:07:23] <%angel949> Cause its the same animation used to kill humans
[2:07:24] <murdocismyhero> Why don't they just set it on fire
[2:07:25] <RinWR> Ableism?
[2:07:25] <+Matto424> it's like a handle for murder but mushroomy
[2:07:25] <bimjojo> "these blind motherfuckers make my skin crawl"- me watching a Pat/Paige stream
[2:07:25] <%floralkami> @kataguro yes. notice it's a stab through the neck, not a slice
[2:07:27] <warmnoid> "those blind motherfuckers make my skin crawl" geeze ellie
[2:07:27] <$Sphincter_Spelunker> oh right, ellie did have the infin-shiv in the last game, right?
[2:07:28] <+Romeboyy> why does ellie have a mask if shes immune?
[2:07:29] <%jiin6> Dina smiled and gave Ellie a marmite sandwhich
[2:07:31] <%UvBenServed> Clearly they should have crunched harder
[2:07:31] <+Cavumentum> Ellie looks like she's got a murderboner during those stealth kills ngl
[2:07:31] <%ragingbrachy> a delicious one
[2:07:33] <AxelCezar> moist mushroom hole
[2:07:34] <ashenjuan25> It is somewhat boring to see that in the 30+ years since the infection we still have these standing structures
[2:07:37] <%Faustgesicht> dont get bit, but do shove your fingers right in their mouth
[2:07:38] <%SirGO0SE> GTAB
[2:07:38] <PlasticJake> they're just leaving all the spores there to infect others later üòÇ
[2:07:39] <%Pookiedaexzile> HE tied Scissors to a bat....Joel might be a engineering Genius
[2:07:39] <calamarvelous> Jesus Ellie
[2:07:39] <%notgarza> 95/100
[2:07:42] <%gespenst25> you are full of 1 bottle
[2:07:42] <%de1ete_forever> piss bottles
[2:07:42] <+Nahkc> I see bottles but no bricks xqcStare
[2:07:43] <+RainingTapes> w cant have multiple unique animations guys
[2:07:44] <OneThousandTomatoes> Clickity clack, this shit is whack
[2:07:45] <+krymzen5> no
[2:07:46] <%Nope80808> Cucumber Succulence
[2:07:47] <%chiazamformerlymankeyfigh> @Romeboyy No one can know she's immune
[2:07:50] <+NitronStreams> They sick they click but can they do trick?
[2:07:53] <%doc_ock_rokc> @Cavumentum they just copy pasted the joel animation right over
[2:07:54] <%Valdorick> Lift ENTERILY with your back
[2:07:55] <+Merhabi> Does Ellie hate the blind?
[2:07:57] <%gespenst25> FLU
[2:07:58] <BurdRightsActivist> @RainingTapes Need more CRONCH
[2:07:59] <%PR0swagonist> thats so LOUD
[2:08:00] <EndlessScrapper> Man I cant remember the gameplay being like this. I remembering punching and hitting my way to victory. BUt maybe cause I just really enjoyed the melee. Naughty Dog as good fight controls
[2:08:01] <Dr_Mooose> from the back
[2:08:01] <+Romeboyy> ah that makes more sense
[2:08:02] <dasfauka> jumpscare

[2:08:14] <OneThousandTomatoes> spore covered
[2:08:14] <%derap41> Its the same doctor
[2:08:16] <axelkaspar> That's why they had to kill the clickers first
[2:08:17] <%possumwalsh1221> No presents here presents are fun
[2:08:17] <%Valdorick> Molly
[2:08:20] <mach01_> TIME TO RIOT
[2:08:20] <%de1ete_forever> this is straight up action movie dialouge
[2:08:21] <+PortableBoredom> How far into the game is this?

[2:08:26] <$Sphincter_Spelunker> mold hates fire

[2:08:31] <guppy_> why is it BLOOD red
[2:08:31] <%OldManDeckardCain> time to peacefully protest

[2:08:31] <%ChestMimik> The OTHER Molly you blaze with
[2:08:31] <Nelsukako> delicious molotov
[2:08:31] <+Shady_Zaku> garbage gift for garbage girl

[2:08:35] <Solidnick18> So pro
[2:08:36] <%Valdorick> uh... wait... uh... FUCKING HOW!?
[2:08:37] <%gespenst25> it's upsidedown
[2:08:37] <Noeralf31> Until Dawn-style 'turn item around in your hand' stuff
[2:08:38] <BurdRightsActivist> ABSORB IT INTO THE BACKPACK
[2:08:38] <Meekest> It kinda looks like shit
[2:08:38] <%possumwalsh1221> I can‚Äôt tell if the liquid looks good or bad
[2:08:39] <%Pookiedaexzile> That's a waste
[2:08:39] <AxelCezar> LIQUID PHYSICS
[2:08:39] <Jrockoni> my guiding light
[2:08:39] <%AdjectiveNown> You were here all along - my guiding molotov
[2:08:40] <@SoFarFetched> Bringing new meaning to Pop a Molly
[2:08:40] <%Pappajimbo> that would have evoparated years ago
[2:08:41] <%Pyroclase> Pyroclase subscribed at Tier 1. They've subscribed for 5 months! Hope you three all have a great month.
[2:08:41] <%Coystick> R u pro yet?
[2:08:43] <%Faustgesicht> oh i rhought it was a tactical shotgun
[2:08:45] <+DZiffer> that rag is cleaner than the one she used to patch herself up
[2:08:46] <Poncho_Freestyle> so many developers died so you could appreciate that molotov
[2:08:46] <Moonlight_Grimoire> that's not how you make a molotov gosh darn it.
[2:08:47] <%Manwad> My guiding moonshine, you were at my side all along!
[2:08:48] <%Purple_badger3000> "I'm a pro" *puts it upside down into her backpack*
[2:08:48] <%Valdorick> GAS FUCKING GOES BAD
[2:08:50] <%asaoirc> Mazel to, molotov
[2:08:51] <+rottingpastry> "I'm a pro" throw it at your feet
[2:08:51] <+Solutha> in her bag upside down
[2:08:52] <deeewooh> IT DISSPEARED
[2:08:52] <ape_hawk> yeah, dont light it and then put it back in your pocket, JOEL
[2:08:53] <%valriot> PILLS. HERE.
[2:08:54] <%gespenst25> oo piece of candy
[2:08:56] <%bluefooddye1> Delicious, spore covered supplements
[2:08:56] <runelordhades> "I'm a pro" She says as you put in in UPSIDE DOWN
[2:08:57] <+RICE02> Monster Energy Red
[2:08:57] <%derap41> Ellies is going to have all the vitamins
[2:08:58] <%Pookiedaexzile> Too much extra work in that Molotov
[2:08:58] <KingVantq> Mmmm old pills
[2:08:59] <%Piemen99> you wanna protect yourself or do some damage?
[2:09:00] <Phoenon> Probably enough to upgrade now
[2:09:01] <%Dfreddy8> Ooooh Piece of Candy
[2:09:02] <%StarkMaximum> ellie touches it to her backpack and absorbs it into her inventory
[2:09:03] <+MediocreHermits> oooo i piece of candy
[2:09:03] <+krymzen5> ye
[2:09:03] <%Faustgesicht> totes
[2:09:04] <+artyom47> less effective
[2:09:04] <%Valdorick> It becomes a Jelly
[2:09:05] <%Ganerumo> basically
[2:09:06] <%gaomachine> Destabilizes given time
[2:09:06] <%SirGO0SE> B R A P
[2:09:06] <+Merhabi> that doesnt look great
[2:09:07] <%optimasmaximas> .....
[2:09:07] <%asaoirc> Mazel tov, Molotov
[2:09:07] <%spiritofmojave> Yep and it can evaporate
[2:09:07] <%nikoloas_> yeah
[2:09:08] <benjiFG> can you still hold triangle to pick up everything in a small area
[2:09:09] <%SoySocks> it breaks down
[2:09:09] <Klarrann3> exactly, Pat
[2:09:09] <%Mister_McDerp> ye, it goes bad
[2:09:10] <pennykettle_> thats why you cant just buy gas en mass when its cheap
[2:09:11] <%gstut1> too late
[2:09:11] <%possumwalsh1221> If it‚Äôs open yea
[2:09:11] <+Toblo1> It decays and becomes less efficent
[2:09:12] <Animorphimagi> -_-
[2:09:12] <%ragingbrachy> i will. stop me i dare you
[2:09:14] <%MisterTylerrr> yes
[2:09:14] <%Idziman> ooh piece of candy
[2:09:15] <Lutre> just huff it instead kids
[2:09:16] <%treemanfour> It evaporates, needs to be fixed
[2:09:16] <%derap41> Also Don't eat 30 year old pills
[2:09:17] <Poncho_Freestyle> it gets more fizzy
[2:09:17] <+SolidusRex> Braaaaap
[2:09:18] <a_mad_dragon> it turns to varnish
[2:09:19] <%D00msDayDan> but it smells so nice
[2:09:20] <OpenMikeLive> unless you're that kid that wanted to be a transformer
[2:09:20] <urbana_venandi> Gas lasts like 4 months right?
[2:09:21] <%PlainSimpleTailor> Gaming Industry, can we have a freaking moratorium on having rotatable in game items? ffs I don't care how detailed this model I'll only see up close once is
[2:09:21] <SGrim> When the future comes and we must fight the police, remember to not stick the rag into the bottle. Close the bottle and tie the rag to the outside. This prevents back-burning.
[2:09:21] <%doc_ock_rokc> Gas goes bad in like a month
[2:09:21] <%Nope80808> You cant tell me what not to do
[2:09:22] <%jiin6> pat and paige know from experience?
[2:09:23] <%ceriani1234> and none of these heard the loud banging i guess
[2:09:23] <mastermidget23> Wait, I just got here, why is Ellie wearing a gas mask for the spores? She's immune.
[2:09:23] <+PleasantLee> petrol goes bad after a few months. the chemicals and components seperate after a while
[2:09:24] <%spiritofmojave> My car has been sitting for months and it's basically an empty tank noe
[2:09:27] <%gaomachine> But molotov's can also be made with high proof alcohol
[2:09:28] <%chiazamformerlymankeyfigh> Did you know you can pick up items by holding triangle, who knew
[2:09:28] <canadadan55> gasoline expires after 6 months or so
[2:09:30] <yourliteraldog> Real men huff plastic glue
[2:09:31] <%Faustgesicht> but Daddy needs his JUICE
[2:09:33] <Jolly_Adventurer> @PatStaresAt Can you still hold triangle to collect all nearby items like in 1?
[2:09:33] <ashenjuan25> You seeing how little has changed in this game really is making me think I‚Äôm kind of bored with the scavenger apocalypse fantasy tbh
[2:09:35] <$Sphincter_Spelunker> @mastermidget23 secrets
[2:09:36] <Phoenon> Can't see that flashlight though
[2:09:38] <+Soliloquy123> Clickers are still creepy af
[2:09:40] <Solidnick18> smart
[2:09:40] <rabidmonkey32> turns into varnish
[2:09:42] <pennykettle_> Pat don't you remember the episode of always sunny where they buy gasoline during a recession so they can resell it later
[2:09:43] <%flechet> time to drink gas pat told me too
[2:09:43] <%FluffiTamamo> Pat totally wont use the molotov he just got because 'consumables tho'.
[2:09:47] <%Sapphire_Breeze> why don't they attack each other if they are triggered by movement and sound
[2:09:48] <SchroedingersFerret> They sound like Meat
[2:09:49] <+Delenay> why do zomebies never go after each other?
[2:09:51] <Nelsukako> look at all those npcs to stab
[2:09:52] <%worldbrand> also what if it just smells gross
[2:09:54] <%gespenst25> Also the fungus is still gross...
[2:09:56] <TheWe4pon> how come they arnt all clickers yet?
[2:09:57] <+GingerStrawhat> Yeah that makes sense since she did that last game
[2:09:57] <%D00msDayDan> i bet neil just forgot
[2:09:58] <%possumwalsh1221> It couldn‚Äôt possibly be an oversight no way never
[2:10:00] <%jiin6> spores suck taste like feet
[2:10:00] <Kravus> @patstaresat I don't get it. If Joel was telling the truth and her being immune meant nothing, than why would it matter if others found out?
[2:10:01] <%derap41> Dina made it clear they don't know
[2:10:01] <%gstut1> 1000 hours of crunch for just that 1 death animation
[2:10:02] <%BinaryFireball> do zombos eat eachother?
[2:10:03] <+Shady_Zaku> Pat "I'LL NEED IT LATER" Boivin
[2:10:05] <shades_are_gucci> why do you have batman vision for zamnos
[2:10:06] <%ChestMimik> Make a noise then blaze it
[2:10:06] <%Pappajimbo> gaosoline has additves at specific amounts as gas ages those additives become too concentrated and messes up engines
[2:10:07] <%Starotter70> Kill them all Ellie
[2:10:07] <+Deekman> only 2 people know she's immune
[2:10:08] <%Pyroclase> Looks like this game gives you more ammo than the last game?
[2:10:08] <%dinnydanny777> Knives go bad too
[2:10:11] <%de1ete_forever> the supermarket is symbolic of naughty dogs work conditions
[2:10:13] <+DZiffer> if you think about it, why don't the clickers get triggered by the survivor-like moans of the runners?
[2:10:13] <trianglehat> social distance those zombos
[2:10:14] <%dinnydanny777> Knives rust
[2:10:15] <+Verd_254> spores still suck to breath even if you are immune
[2:10:16] <%Valdorick> Man, she's really freaking out
[2:10:17] <%chiazamformerlymankeyfigh> This might get LOUD
[2:10:17] <%Nope80808> Convient use for that molotov
[2:10:19] <Sklauda1> they can probablly smell live meat
[2:10:26] <BoborRUU> listen mode is just a substitute for surround sound speakers
[2:10:27] <%LiquidDinosaur> @Delenay yeah i get it normally but i feel like clickers would attack runners. Like, Runners are basically jut angry psycho people. They'd sound just like people, clickers wouldnt hear them as being one of their own
[2:10:28] <%superc37> @sapphire_breeze there are a lot of parasites that instinctively know not to attack each other
[2:10:28] <+Merhabi> Why does she throw her head back in bliss on every kill
[2:10:30] <ashenjuan25> This looks like the left behind dlc too much
[2:10:30] <@SoFarFetched> @Kravus cause some people act crazy banana pants in the apocalypse and do rash things
[2:10:31] <JPstudmuffin> Just needs to be better than Uncharted 4 honestly. Fuck that bullshit game lol
[2:10:33] <%ragingbrachy> ?
[2:10:33] <Solidnick18> spotted
[2:10:33] <lessthanhuman_tv> @kravus The last people tried to harvest her fucking spinal column LUL
[2:10:34] <Gruhunchously> So runners are people who've been recently infected, Clickers are people who've been infected for longer. Bloaters are the ones who've been infected the longest.
[2:10:38] <DE777ON> the light
[2:10:38] <%dinnydanny777> If you breathe in spores you can get chest problems still

[2:12:22] <%velemi> psaCrazy
[2:12:22] <%Pyroclase> I guess it just goes to show that humans are the REAL difficult to kill monsters
[2:12:23] <Phoenon> You couldn't really melee clickers for the most part if I remember right
[2:12:23] <+Metrick_92> Enemy powercreep
[2:12:23] <%gespenst25> You had a board.
[2:12:26] <TheMorilo> Remember that one clicker on that room
[2:12:26] <silverira> yes they basically could track across the zone
[2:12:28] <%Daxalog> Probably toned them down due to feedback.

[2:12:34] <DynzelWashington> Thanks for the PrideFlower @bestteamaker
[2:12:34] <%doc_ock_rokc> Yeah its almost as if the devs don't know how to balance so they made the fucking weak

[2:12:52] <+megaotter> @floralkami yes but as son as you take the mask off if you breathe one in athat's stuck in your clothes you're done, that's how contamination works
[2:12:52] <agrippaarpeggio> "I don' need shivs no more" PogChamp "but clickers weak now tho" BibleThump
[2:12:52] <%Dfreddy8> Pretty sure there's more items, but you know Pat's blind.
[2:12:53] <%BinaryFireball> because
[2:12:54] <yourliteraldog> I bet your gonna lose your knife
[2:12:54] <Nelsukako> well, we didnt have molotov and a riffle in the beginning of the first one
[2:12:55] <%Pookiedaexzile> Ellies Gonna Hurle something thru that hole alright

[2:12:59] <OneThousandTomatoes> mode detail please
[2:12:59] <Noeralf31> expecting this game to be logical?
[2:13:00] <%ChestMimik> Hey maybe "couple hours before a snowstorm" was a bad time to do this
[2:13:00] <+threamstream> You need 3 play coins to open the door
[2:13:01] <%chiazamformerlymankeyfigh> CLIM
[2:13:01] <EndlessScrapper> Well if you want to get technical the infected are more dangerous to Joel because one bite hes done. Garbage doesnt have to fear that
[2:13:07] <%Plus_On_Black> We're not new to this Pat.
[2:13:08] <%chiazamformerlymankeyfigh> not that way
[2:13:10] <+michingmallecho> After a couple of years, zombo go level 2
[2:13:11] <%gstut1> lookm how sad the food store is
[2:13:12] <ashenjuan25> Zombies are kind of boring once you get to post 20 years era after infection
[2:13:13] <%dinnydanny777> Yeah mushroom spores definitely stick to clothing
[2:13:13] <%jiin6> you have jump but no clime
[2:13:15] <f4ntom98> Because Video games
[2:13:18] <%Idziman> PARKOUR
[2:13:18] <%galaxyswirl> there is, but pat is blind
[2:13:21] <%possumwalsh1221> No climbing cause climbing is fun
[2:13:22] <%Valdorick> That seems convoluted for a rusted metal barricade that likely has busted as screws on its railing... I mean, I bet you could just give it a solid team kick and knock it down.
[2:13:23] <%crimsonharvest> freezer door behind you?
[2:13:23] <%mysterypork> FASTBALL SPECIAL BABY
[2:13:24] <%chiazamformerlymankeyfigh> JUMP
[2:13:28] <+rottingpastry> we're all out of bread, I'm so lost without it
[2:13:32] <+megaotter> they would basically need hazmat suites,not just masks
[2:13:33] <%floralkami> @doc_ock_rokc they are just as dangerous as the first game, but this time you don't have a shitty shiv, ang 6 shooter
[2:13:35] <%Manwad> this is the same dilemma that Dead Space 2 got into, yeah? Combat's smoother and easier because MC is more experienced, but then the main enemy's less threatening
[2:13:35] <%jiin6> OPEN AIR

[2:20:01] <+redhandedbee> I do love a library though
[2:20:01] <%Pyroclase> why is there a minimum required number of spores to be infected? Is just a couple spores not good enough?
[2:20:01] <%Pookiedaexzile> Like Coaine
[2:20:02] <%ChestMimik> How long has that town been there anyways? It kinda feels like they don't know the area.

[2:26:25] <%StarkMaximum> Here's the question, chat: Would you rather have a 1/4 chance of a one hit kill, or require 4 100% accurate shots to kill the enemy?
[2:26:25] <cam3lface> TONS OF DAMAGE
[2:26:26] <%GohanHitsugaya> Damage is useless if you can't hit anything

[2:26:55] <mamabedlam> Can we talk about how the round is only ejected from the chamber once when you take out the pistol on the upgrade bench? Because I think that's cool.

[2:56:31] <AxelCezar> "you will live to hunt us down and kill us" 10/10 druckman
[2:56:32] <MondoCL> maybe she imagined him

[2:59:26] <snipsnoopyouvebeendooped> Ellie, the first president is named Washington. That could legit mean ANYTHING
[2:59:27] <%aBlueWizard> Must kill fast and bullets too slow.
[2:59:28] <„Éè„ÇØ„Ç¢> JUST KILL THEM ALL SO THERE'S NO ONE TO TAKE REVENGE ON YOU

[2:59:30] <%taku_toots> Ellie will become Kratos
[2:59:30] <TheMadBadger> The fact the druckmann self insert spits on Joel is so messed up
[2:59:30] <Vashido22> @PatStaresAt Sony DMA-ed all of /v/ for shitting on this
[2:59:30] <%JenovasPuppet> When is the last time you touched the controller?
[2:59:30] <%ragingbrachy> ok :)
[2:59:31] <OneThousandTomatoes> The first game must be really good if it makes people like this game by proxy
[2:59:31] <R3c0n31> WHY IS TOMMY THE SMART ONE HERE
[2:59:31] <ofloofy> Whats a story with out stupid mistakes anyway Kappa

[2:59:32] <gabagoosh> don't be a pussy, tommy.
[2:59:32] <$lotharrio> No, every decision Abbey makes, from here on out, is her being stupid. Her group should have killed Ellie and Tommy when they had the chance.
[2:59:33] <SomeAsianDood> Ellie is garbage noe. the cycle is complete Kappa
[2:59:34] <CrowbarFacelift> Older Tommy kinda looks like Sean Bean
[2:59:34] <dante07061947> Revenge iz bad guyzz

[2:59:36] <%BoneofMalkav> Ellie's stupid, Jesse's stupid, Fuck it! The whole cast is stupid!
[2:59:37] <%baronblank> so are they trying to make ellie stupid to make abby more likeable
[2:59:38] <%1buckboom> I for real don't get why they thought this was ok to write. Every decision that everyone has made so far makes literally zero sense.
[2:59:38] <King_Kth> Ellie's a fucking anime protag holy shit
[2:59:38] <%dinnydanny777> I LOVE HOW JOEL WAS AN ASSHOLE BUT WE NEVER ACTUALLY SEE HIM BE AN ASSHOLE
[2:59:38] <%tigerfang86> Joel was a MASSIVE SCUMBAG
[2:59:39] <WholesomeCumiesPeddler> HOW IS THIS 10/10
[2:59:39] <Ipsenscastle> They killed off Joel so fast that if you hadn't played the first game you wouldn't even care
[2:59:40] <+redhandedbee> Murder is fine. It‚Äôs fine
[2:59:40] <pennykettle_> oh they were brothers? I remember nothing about the game
[2:59:41] <%thetrashman_sc> mgs2 lied in its trailer
[2:59:41] <%de1ete_forever> i would kill Joel
[2:59:41] <+A123yourdead> JUST LIKE JOELS
[2:59:42] <%doc_ock_rokc> Murder is bad thus elie wants to kill thus Abby the murderer is the hero we all need
[2:59:42] <%ChestMimik> Why did they let Ellie live? Did they NOT see this as a possible outcome?
[2:59:42] <+OmegaOcelotOk> They hated each other tho
[2:59:42] <Nelsukako> lets murder or get the fuck out
[2:59:43] <%BigCoffee> That's not fair, Tommy has to run a town
[2:59:43] <Solidnick18> yep
[2:59:44] <%shadowace2400> he has a wife
[2:59:46] <%weissguard> TBF to Tommy: Some people get angry at the death of kin, others shut down.
[2:59:46] <Them00n> Ellie has the Uchiha Curse of Hatred.
[2:59:46] <urbana_venandi> God tier writing
[2:59:47] <%myriad_truth> I hate this game now...
[2:59:47] <+Blokehat> the CYCLE of REVENGE
[2:59:48] <%Schrodingers_Box> You try having a roided up mad man kill your father figure
[2:59:48] <runelordhades> Naw man, Tommy's tryin' to do damage control.
[2:59:49] <jijipose> And Tommy knows they saved Abby's life literally minutes earlier
[2:59:49] <%tolloponik> it's amazing how little I care about this game after this scene
[2:59:51] <42nfl19> I thought Tommy was the leader?
[2:59:51] <+Radalorian> Now Ellie is the villain, Druckman over here playing 4-D chess HahaThink HahaThink HahaThink
[2:59:52] <+NitronStreams> SUCH A LUST FOR REVENGE, WHO?!
[2:59:52] <tactician0> Violnce is always the answer :-)
[2:59:52] <%dinnydanny777> ALWAYA REMEMBER THAT WE NEVER ACTUALLY SAW JOEL EVER BE A SCUMBAG
[2:59:53] <AxelCezar> "lets just save this rando and go right to their house!" - the suspicious guy
[2:59:53] <dukenux> Tommy doesn't deserve this
[2:59:54] <therakishsage> Or maybe he's just kind of tired of going out there and killing shit.
[2:59:54] <DE777ON> fuck no leave now
[2:59:57] <$Sphincter_Spelunker> Ellie UCHIHA
[2:59:57] <%spiritofmojave> because he WAS a scumbag, but dear god fuck all of this
[2:59:57] <$D4C_Trice> Tommy ran away from Joel because Joel was too hardcore
[2:59:58] <%sniffy77> How far did Abby track joel down?
[3:00:00] <%LegendGHT> lie
[3:00:00] <%Engwithan_Elder_God> Brothers know how much of a shit you are.
[3:00:01] <mar_krow> Rip and tear doom girl
[3:00:03] <+Klonoa__> just leave who cares
[3:00:03] <+galaxyradioarcadeedition> @PatStaresAt Having lived as long as they have in a nightmare future, Why would they give their real names to total f-ing strangers?
[3:00:04] <teflonbilly777> @myriad_truth This game was unnecessary since the announce trailer
[3:00:04] <+LeviStreamsStuff> Imagine killing the main character 2 hours in
[3:00:04] <cipher758> I hope the mushroom people wins this. I'm rooting for the zombies now.
[3:00:04] <Rigid_Iguana> Pat, revenge is actually the only answer to this situation.
[3:00:04] <yourliteraldog> Ellie becomes the dumb punisher
[3:00:05] <+michingmallecho> Tommy was like ‚Äúhe had it coming‚Äù
[3:00:05] <Poncho_Freestyle> rip and tear ellie... until it is done
[3:00:06] <%restingbones> Tommy's got people to live for.
[3:00:06] <erohoney> "Joel look my last Pepsi Crystal so I'm glad he's dead"
[3:00:06] <waifoong98> so saddddddd
[3:00:06] <%Joustar_> Tommy should be super NOT on board with this knowing what Joel did, making this extra dumb
[3:00:07] <thetruthofyourbeing> ELLIE HAS METER USE IT
[3:00:08] <EndlessScrapper> You know what I can't stand? Revenge plots where the protag kills literally every goon but refuses to kill the big bad. I swear if Garbage kills all of Abby's friends but doesnt kill Abby Im going to be pissed
[3:00:09] <%PlainSimpleTailor> Joel only killed people who TRIED TO KILL HIM. Why the FUCK are we ignoring this
[3:00:10] <%YakumoYomi> @Them00n Is she gonna kill Dina and take her eyes?!
[3:00:10] <farrellcityking> You‚Äôd be the same way about your brother pat
[3:00:11] <f4ntom98> They got over the grief fast

[3:00:15] <+IamScorpius> LUL
[3:00:16] <%blackbaron98> Joel wasnt really a good person at all
[3:00:16] <RubberFistFight> So I guess Tommy's just ok with the fact that Joel's skull just got taken to the fairway.
[3:00:17] <%spiritofmojave> No way LUL
[3:00:18] <%HaikUnagi> RIP AND TEAR, UNTIL IT IS DONE ELLIE

[3:00:19] <%SnackinOnChimps> Washington needs to be Liberated, FROM JOEL
[3:00:20] <%ChestMimik> In a real setting they'd probably have died in the zombie blizzard
[3:00:20] <+OwlLightningMage> This is still stupid
[3:00:20] <SGrim> @dinnydanny777 he was kind of an asshole until Tess died, I guess.

[3:00:29] <%doc_ock_rokc> @PatStaresAt You can tell when amy henning left that they cobbled together a script for last of us and were fucked for this game
[3:00:29] <+Neoepochx> @PlainSimpleTailor Because people want to fit a narrative that doesn't exist.
[3:00:29] <disflipmat> I never saw or read anything so I'm just fucking confused

[3:00:31] <Jetsfantasy> Very forced
[3:00:32] <%Purple_badger3000> They barely explain the motives
[3:00:32] <TrashLeviathan> i wasnt spoiled
[3:00:32] <%DesertPenguin> THEY WANT YOU TO GO "WTF"

[3:00:34] <olaksi> I mean media res is a thing
[3:00:34] <blackkanye> I knew and I still got whiplash
[3:00:34] <%Ganerumo> People kept saying "you need context" but the context MAKES IT WORSE
[3:00:35] <%ElenaManetta> we dont even know her motivation yet
[3:00:36] <akosinoogie> i suppose so, pat
[3:00:36] <%aBlueWizard> @ 100sniffy77 she just got stupid luck and ran into him
[3:00:37] <AvoidingTheCoronaVirus> i didn't kill any of the surgeons in the first game tho

[3:00:37] <%Pyroclase> Bioshock 1 has a far superior golf club murder, really
[3:00:37] <+Insuffrivity> Disagree tbh.
[3:00:38] <+treborant> she did it cuz the lulz
[3:00:39] <OmegaFatalis> how far into the game is this?
[3:00:39] <%Das_Bass> KILL 'EM ALL

[3:00:41] <@Moobot> I've been playing this game for how long? Oh only 3h 50s.
[3:00:41] <$Dakuu75> @PatStaresAt why is it bad?
[3:00:42] <%amiavamp> theres no context
[3:00:42] <+Donutjulio> MGS2 would've still worked if it was spoiled
[3:00:42] <letters_numbers> the spoilers kind of softened it
[3:00:42] <%Reilata> I didn't know anything about this. I don't watch trailers.
[3:00:42] <%Sokumotanaka> I CANNOT BELIEVE THEY TREAT TOMMY LIKE THIS! HE SHOULD BE ON THE MURDER TRIP TOO!
[3:00:42] <%GohanHitsugaya> It is very bad.
[3:00:42] <%de1ete_forever> i dont even remember why they wanted him dead?
[3:00:42] <DE777ON> super shitty writting they should be ashamed
[3:00:42] <cayenne> Did I miss something?
[3:00:43] <%Reveresao> leaked
[3:00:43] <%thegreenbenis> It's still garbage
[3:00:43] <$Sphincter_Spelunker> it subverted my expectations

[3:00:43] <%Joustar_> I wasn't spoiled on that, and I'm here like oh.
[3:00:43] <agustorm123> ZE BAD
[3:00:43] <Tonicky > Seemed like random death in a HBO show
[3:00:44] <%thetrashman_sc> sometimes people just die Kappa
[3:00:44] <R3c0n31> SUPRISE, Main Chracter dead. Feel BAD
[3:00:44] <+hawk_rush> like, 2-3 hours in

[3:00:45] <%sabertoothzombie> god you whine so much
[3:00:45] <%weissguard> I didn't spoil myself. This is actually bad writing that I can't believe they did.
[3:00:45] <+BeezusHrist> FATE @PatStaresAt
[3:00:45] <%1buckboom> Like even Joel's own brother is saying it's stupid idea to go out there. His OWN FUCKING BROTHER
[3:00:45] <shubachi> hard disagree on that
[3:00:45] <Kraigerex1> Is old protag dead?
[3:00:45] <Lutre> EXPECTATIONS - SUBVERTED
[3:00:46] <berserker_103> just got here... it already happened?
[3:00:46] <xbb1024> nah, it's cool. I didn't like Joel
[3:00:46] <Tucker0603> what happened, just got here
[3:00:46] <stranger59> I liked it
[3:00:46] <kindashagg> real forced
[3:00:46] <hoopray> how is it worse than the leaks?
[3:00:47] <%chiazamformerlymankeyfigh> This plan is about as crazy as Abby's
[3:00:47] <DeltascapeV4> 10/10 Perfect Game BTW
[3:00:47] <+Taglog7> Lube it up 1st
[3:00:47] <neekocheeko> it's bad story telling
[3:00:48] <%wrightlight94> The first one is so much better than this
[3:00:48] <+Thanatoast250> I never saw the spoilers. I actively avoided them, and I'm seeing that as pretty bullshit. It's really bad.
[3:00:48] <sperith0703> Thanks for the early code, Sony.
[3:00:48] <%hzealot> @PatStaresAt goblin slayer had it right you have to kill the kids to stop them from coming back for you
[3:00:48] <%toastybites> it should have been the middle of the game
[3:00:49] <%Pookiedaexzile> LIKE A REVEAL
[3:00:49] <+TLee456> How far into the game was that?
[3:00:49] <+MediocreHermits> shock at how poor the story is
[3:00:49] <%PlainSimpleTailor> NINE OUT OF TEN GUYS, REMEMBER
[3:00:49] <KeystoneA2> Reminder that every leak you've heard was 100% accurate.
[3:00:50] <%optimasmaximas> rip
[3:00:50] <%derap41> I'm not upset about Joel dying but they could have done it better
[3:00:50] <timblenaut> 0 respect for their old storyline, KILL THEM AND MOVE ON
[3:00:50] <Ipsenscastle> Everything Joel did was super relateable after the intro with his daughter. They got us too on board with him
[3:00:50] <+Shubreaker> THEY SUBVERTED MY EXPECTATIONS
[3:00:50] <WillyFresh992> NO PAT ITS REAL
[3:00:50] <SolGainer> WRITER KILLED JOEL

[3:00:53] <BrachyZoid> Now they are going to make us try to feel for the killer because that's how this game is
[3:00:53] <mak0t0yukii> 10/10 GAME MASTERPIECE REVIEWS
[3:00:53] <+krymzen5> its like saying "fuck you" to fans of 1
[3:00:53] <%lucaflowe> It's real bad
[3:00:53] <+doug_famous> YOU'LL NEVER USERSTAND MY ART
[3:00:53] <+Blokehat> did it subvert your expectations?
[3:00:53] <Phoenon> Expectations SUBVERTED: Bravo Druckjima
[3:00:54] <+vaultzombie> I feel like this should have been the climax, NOT the inciting incident
[3:00:54] <%MisterTylerrr> That should have been a middle of the game swerve.
[3:00:54] <%taku_toots> but you were shocked
[3:00:54] <+StrawberryPantsu> Miller?
[3:00:55] <%boomstickery> the game could ahve started ehre

[3:01:03] <Katalist_> "Good fit"
[3:01:04] <%dinnydanny777> @sgrim Because the game tells us that, we never see him do anything "assholeish" the game just tells us he's not a good person
[3:01:04] <%de1ete_forever> fake flowers
[3:01:04] <CrowbarFacelift> the soft, delicate winter dirt

[3:01:07] <%dave323dave> SHUSH

[3:01:07] <%floralkami> those look artificial
[3:01:07] <+TylerMystix> So you're telling me Tommy and Joel just accepted the fact that another settlement was nearby their own and didn't suspect a thing?
[3:01:07] <+zooeymainbtw> BUT NO GUYS, ABBY'S MURDER GOOD BECAUSE JUSTICE
[3:01:08] <Gruhunchously> Aww, that's their theme from the first game.
[3:01:08] <3Xgilly> Eat his hair to gain powers

[3:01:10] <%SoySocks> WHO MADE THAT GRAVESTONE
[3:01:10] <TheMorilo> It's good
[3:01:10] <$lotharrio> They didn't even know, 100%, who he was before they were shooting him.
[3:01:10] <anthozoareef> GOLFED
[3:01:11] <%Kataguro> I feel nothing
[3:01:11] <%Promessa_EX> Yeah, she doesn't hesitate at all, shows a complete lack of character, abby is a trash
[3:01:11] <generalve> they could be fake flowers
[3:01:11] <Profmcstevie> 3 and a half hours to get to the murder of the first games protag, let that sit with you for a bit
[3:01:11] <BrickleBork> they actually made him a tombstone
[3:01:11] <+BanishedLink> HOW THE FUCK IS THIS A 10/10?
[3:01:11] <%ChestMimik> THEY LEAVE TOMORROW BUT HE HAS A MARKED GRAVE

[3:01:16] <+TheWarpJump> they should have pulled an MGS2 and had us play as abby for like 10 hours not knowing where she was going and than having this happen.
[3:01:16] <+OmegaOcelotOk> But we all kind knew he was gonna die. hes old and a sequel
[3:01:16] <Solidnick18> LUL

[3:01:18] <%bigbrothergannon> did I already miss the motivation???
[3:01:18] <jorniev> he needed to die near the end or in the middle
[3:01:18] <roninko_real> This was definitely not the best way to start the game. Like, WE HAVE NO IDEA who Abby is. Like literally nothing.
[3:01:19] <%DracaenaLeaf> How did they get the words in the stone

[3:01:35] <%valriot> Yeah but all those smart people left or got fired
[3:01:35] <Spyder1246> Anyone who doesn't like this game is a homophobic bigot

[3:01:50] <%lockhead45> Guitar magic
[3:01:51] <%Scottigecko> They went into zombietown, carrying a dead body, to make a tombstone to bury a dude
[3:01:52] <ireliaismaiwaifu> the ones that said that got fired prob
[3:01:52] <+beansoup> ooh gameplay i forgot this was a game
[3:01:53] <tactician0> @PatStaresAt angriestpat woud kill all of them
[3:01:53] <R3c0n31> But Stupid + stupid = GENious
[3:01:53] <%derap41> The Writers the kept the Ship afloat left and only the hacks remained
[3:01:54] <%dmian07> Is the song
[3:01:55] <+krymzen5> they fired the lead writer
[3:01:55] <%walternatorz> 1st game, yes, but what about 2nd game?
[3:01:55] <+rottingpastry> Garbage and Garbage 2.0
[3:01:55] <roninko_real> How are we supposed to feel anything for this. If we didn't know who Abby was in the first place
[3:01:56] <dwarf_viewer> Im so sorry hennig
[3:01:56] <%notgarza> 95/100
[3:01:57] <+TylerMystix> Wait they said that??
[3:01:57] <%chiazamformerlymankeyfigh> WHY WOULD SHE AGREE TO THIS
[3:01:58] <%BusterRepukken> you know most old ND employees arent there anymore right
[3:01:58] <%Dementedpenguin> wtf, can't even give them horses
[3:01:59] <%de1ete_forever> just have a 3 way with the horse, go 4 broke
[3:01:59] <asbestos_man45> Paige is a hot VVamen
[3:01:59] <SuperStubbo> How much Gameplay has there been?
[3:02:00] <%Kataguro> Look at this hallway
[3:02:00] <%MSN04_Sazabi> Why does she care? If Tommy doesn't
[3:02:00] <twoto858> TOMMY WENT ALONE
[3:02:00] <+solomonpun> @PatStaresAt didn't one of the writers for the first game quit/was fired?
[3:02:01] <+artyom47> i mean one positive is the game looks pretty at least
[3:02:01] <%spiritofmojave> Amy Henig would've done this game 10x better
[3:02:02] <BrachyZoid> Are they like, middle schoolers? they look so tiny
[3:02:03] <+DZiffer> "It's too stupid!" - Neil Hackman: "That never stopped me before!"
[3:02:03] <$adimcorner> cus i got guns. youve got guns, we got guns
[3:02:04] <+Yopie> A car?
[3:02:05] <%SnackinOnChimps> it's the guitbox
[3:02:05] <am_omega> Wow, Tommy riding solo.
[3:02:05] <%Jordanak13> That tombstone was made with a high grade machine, the lettering is perfectly sized and spaced.
[3:02:07] <%LiquidDinosaur> they found a tombstone for another guy named joel and stole it
[3:02:07] <Justin_wongs_wang2> Dina is pretty hot despite the nose
[3:02:07] <willtheprofessional> TOMMY WENT ALONE
[3:02:09] <Moonlight_Grimoire> did the original writers even work on this? This is fucking pants on head stupid. Like painful stupid.
[3:02:09] <%Broand> a corse
[3:02:09] <%optimasmaximas> TOMMY WENT BY HIMSELF?1
[3:02:10] <%ChestMimik> This plot is idiotic but is the gameplay fun?
[3:02:10] <+zooeymainbtw> Can't wait for last of us 2 brotherhood that follows the manga storyline
[3:02:11] <%restingbones> when youre the only gays around, you have to stick together.
[3:02:11] <SGrim> @dinnydanny777 I'd class his dialogue as abrasive, but nothing else. He definitely wasn't some amoral piece of shit like Cuckman thinks.
[3:02:11] <%floralkami> what if they fired those writers?
[3:02:11] <Solidnick18> i wasn't
[3:02:12] <%HaikUnagi> Amy Hennig left Naughty Dog, FOR THIS!
[3:02:13] <%tigerfang86> MY EXPECTATIONS
[3:02:13] <%cvp5127> why
[3:02:14] <jorniev> LOOK AROUND
[3:02:14] <Bladeexe> is it still the same team as the last game?
[3:02:15] <Snark_Streams> that was so fucking dumb
[3:02:15] <%Theycallmenerf> Is THLOU2 the Last Jedi of TLOU chat?
[3:02:15] <%derap41> I feel nothing I feel less than nothing I have negative emotions
[3:02:16] <lessthanhuman_tv> I was :)
[3:02:16] <%ceriani1234> so who's worse now, cage or druckman?
[3:02:16] <+NotSoAccurateNo1> hopefully this is just to get the ball rolling and then the plot hard-pivots to something better
[3:02:17] <%danielm427> boss says is a gud idea so we doit
[3:02:17] <KongrawDarts> THE LAST OF US 2 : ELECTRIC FUCK YOU
[3:02:19] <%chiazamformerlymankeyfigh> THIS IS BAD IDEA
[3:02:20] <%azure22900> Mutiny, Joel helped this town get bloody power so they can live.
[3:02:20] <+fetrigon> Now go and get pregnant Dina
[3:02:20] <SummonerMagno> i mean im all up for revenge, but why would somebody else join??
[3:02:21] <%Chimeraelite> I'm shocked as to how FAST it happened
[3:02:21] <%Reveresao> Does she know why they killed joel?
[3:02:22] <%bread_assassin> I dove right into spoilers.
[3:02:22] <ireliaismaiwaifu> no one stops the cuckman
[3:02:23] <snipsnoopyouvebeendooped> the name Washington could mean anything from Washington DC to the first president. Is Ellie just going on a whim that they're in Seattle?
[3:02:23] <diego_andres> Funny that the Hirde1 just gave up and disappears
[3:02:23] <%Kataguro> Dina, this is literally your fault
[3:02:24] <agustorm123> WORST IDEA
[3:02:24] <jase__x> SHE BARELY KNOES ELLIE
[3:02:24] <+Skwizgarr> i's more of a WHY THE FUCK would killing Joel like that be good
[3:02:25] <KokujinDo> I'm shocked at how soulless it was.
[3:02:25] <+YabbaTroll> I was not surprised but didnt expect it
[3:02:25] <+krymzen5> i saw it but still shocked tbh
[3:02:26] <Rigid_Iguana> i stay yo;;u go
[3:02:26] <%linSP> Gonna go buy this game and return it
[3:02:26] <VoidBeam> Schindler‚Äôs lost of videogames
[3:02:26] <AbysmalWulf> IT BROKE NEW GROUND.
[3:02:27] <%1buckboom> @PatStaresAt I'm just surprised like you that it happens so early on.
[3:02:27] <natebud> Spoilers tuin things, we know
[3:02:27] <Run44forrest> WHO MADE THE TOMBSTONE LUL
[3:02:28] <%tigerfang86> ITS LUV

[3:02:29] <RinWR> YOU FUCKED ONCE
[3:02:30] <%TheFabledAble> @patstaresat this is what happens when you horribly crunch your team and they are left with NO TIME to think their own storyline through.
[3:02:30] <BrickleBork> i was a little shocked how early it is
[3:02:31] <@ShockzNDrawe> I'm litterally going into this blind
[3:02:32] <JerZeyCJ> subvert your expectations by lying to you in every trailer about joel being alive
[3:02:32] <The_Forgotten_Alligator> Tommy dead too probably
[3:02:33] <RajelSkoven> I'm shocked how Joel and Tommy were so gddamn stupid.
[3:02:33] <knyttstories> @Theycallmenerf yeah, pretty much
[3:02:33] <%StarkMaximum> Hey you know what I just realized? Joel asks "who are you", she says "guess", and Joel is like "whatever bitch say your line" and Abby never actrually tells him who she is, so from Joel's perspective, she just attacked and killed him for no reason
[3:02:33] <+NinjaWitaSniper> How did this game get 10/10
[3:02:33] <disflipmat> They banged once and now they're in love
[3:02:33] <%valriot> YOU JUST FUCKED, WTF DO YOU MEAN

[3:02:33] <RubberFistFight> jesus christ even if it was possible to pirate this game I wouldn't. This is a goddamn dumpster fire.
[3:02:33] <Gruhunchously> It's clear that they were relying heavily on shock value for that scene.
[3:02:34] <%aBlueWizard> The real subversion would be for her to leave it alone.
[3:02:34] <Top_Lane_Duelist> oh she gonna die aint she
[3:02:34] <%Pookiedaexzile> WE FUCKED ONCE LIFE BOND
[3:02:34] <%Plasmasnake3> this sucks
[3:02:35] <rasseabreeze> DINA IS A RIDE AND DIE BITH
[3:02:35] <%Capn_Trips> So why did Abby kill Joel though? Was that explained?
[3:02:35] <+Loyks> TRUE LOVE 2 SECONDS AGO
[3:02:36] <%weissguard> Since when do they have THIS KIND OF RAPPORT?
[3:02:36] <Wannabe_Reviewer> Man, did Joel even know who Abby was or why she wanted revenge???
[3:02:37] <Tucker0603> boooo
[3:02:37] <%optimasmaximas> LESS THAN

[3:02:47] <afroking1124> murder trip
[3:02:48] <%spiritofmojave> YEAH?
[3:02:48] <%MisterTylerrr> So we have to spend the whole game with this dumb bitch?

[3:04:34] <%Pyroclase> imagine if the entire intro was Abby's story?
[3:04:34] <ape_hawk> no, because then you wouldnt play the game to find out
[3:04:34] <lessthanhuman_tv> some of these sequences are so well done but what the fuck is happening with this sequencing LUL
[3:04:34] <+booty_menace> No thats good storytelling

[3:04:42] <waifoong98> LUL

[3:04:46] <Psyramics> You're going to find out right before you get the chance to kill her, and then its a ~moral choice~ and its going to suck
[3:04:46] <dante07061947> REVENGE BAAAAAD
[3:04:46] <%czeekyplays> I feel like it only works if she is beyond any doubt justified (aka not just revenge)

[3:04:59] <scisssssssors> Narutoshit
[3:04:59] <natebud> That's a pretty weak criticism
[3:05:00] <%dinnydanny777> Good storytelling is how many twists it has
[3:05:00] <%Mr_Pylon> There's a distinct problem here. We have to care that Joel dies, but Joel was a fucking monster.

[3:05:04] <masterfire23> murder makes her pp big
[3:05:04] <%Dragovus> Wouldn't it have been nice if Abby had even a second of hesitation considering JOEL SAVED HER LIFE!
[3:05:04] <+TheWarpJump> Yeah if we play as her for like 10 hours and got to know her and she was looking for someone and the twist was that we were hunting joel the entire time

[3:16:18] <VoidBeam> If you hate this game you‚Äôre sexist
[3:16:18] <%blackbaron98> She is forgettable AF
[3:16:18] <%amiavamp> She's just Human Being
[3:16:18] <TheMadBadger> I don't think i've seen anyone say they like her, in the few people i've watched play this opening section.
[3:16:19] <%GohanHitsugaya> Yeah, I miss old Ellie..
[3:16:19] <%consistentlylistless> stan horse
[3:16:19] <%Mister_McDerp> love interest is a personality type now
[3:16:19] <+KingOfTheGeats> murder is her personality now
[3:16:20] <%Pookiedaexzile> We know she is gay, and that she likes weed
[3:16:20] <%optimasmaximas> HORSE BEST CHARACTER
[3:16:21] <+BeezusHrist> Dina's personality is SEXBOT
[3:16:21] <dante07061947> should have been straight
[3:16:22] <tubit> YEAH HORSIE
[3:16:22] <biomegabear> is "lesbian" her only personality?
[3:16:22] <mach01_> @MayShip it's a protest camp around a police precinct in seattle that semi-jokingly calls itself an 'autonomous zone,' and a whole lot of people are acting like it's chaos and not basically a block party
[3:16:22] <+SaltyGhostRock> She is a Netflix original level love interest
[3:16:22] <+Radalorian> Shimmer the Real MVP
[3:16:23] <%SaiyanShoto> Ellie lost all her charm from the first game
[3:16:23] <$Sphincter_Spelunker> the personality is lover
[3:16:23] <+QuesoFM> shimmergang
[3:16:23] <SomeAsianDood> Horse is a good character
[3:16:24] <+necrocannibal2> cool it with the anti-Semitic remarks
[3:16:24] <%derap41> Ellie has lost her personality she is just Joel 2
[3:16:24] <gabagoosh> she's no tess or young ellie
[3:16:24] <ahaegotrigger> and Garbage had a sidekick
[3:16:24] <%Kaji04> The last of HORSE
[3:16:24] <%xxshadowxx416> horse best
[3:16:25] <%spiritofmojave> She's sorta safe and boring lesbian
[3:16:25] <Wannabe_Reviewer> But Pat, EUGENE!
[3:16:25] <jobbedbone> I like how horses bob their heads
[3:16:25] <Zekuu69> There hasnt been any gameplay for ages
[3:16:25] <%Nope80808> The horse is now dead
[3:16:25] <%czeekyplays> Her personality is "bisexual" because that's all you need for a character in the Druckmann world
[3:16:26] <„Éè„ÇØ„Ç¢> her personality is lesbian
[3:16:26] <%Promessa_EX> What do you mean, the personality is she's gay?
[3:16:26] <%MidnightBurst12> horse is best girl
[3:16:26] <PlasticJake> this game sucks ass üòÇ
[3:16:27] <Yummy_Nukes> their personality is LESBIANS
[3:16:28] <%EuropanLamprey> Sorry, Ellie's Girlfriend
[3:16:28] <$vincerocmm> guy guys shes lesbo we dont need a personality send the game out
[3:16:28] <mar_krow> The feel of mysterious evil
[3:16:29] <%shadylawyerman> this game has already lost my interest, this stinks
[3:16:30] <DKDiamantes> Would you say that your horse is amazing?
[3:16:30] <%Corporate_Redeemer> LOOK AT MY HORSE
[3:16:30] <%warlockwithapixie> !uptime
[3:16:30] <Jackabyte> THERE GOING TO KILL THE HORSE
[3:16:30] <R3c0n31> Horse has yet to upset or fail. JUST SUCCESS
[3:16:30] <$Quiet__Viking> there's no chemistry
[3:16:31] <@Moobot> I've been playing this game for how long? Oh only 3h 16m.
[3:16:31] <+masked_hero_lucky> The horse will probably the best character for the whole game
[3:16:32] <Poncho_Freestyle> THE WHOLE GAME SHOULD'VE BEEN ABOUT ABBY
[3:16:32] <+Freeborg23> That horse powers through everything... no matter how tough... :(
[3:16:33] <asbestos_man45> Her model actress is on youtube. Shes actually likable
[3:16:33] <%Dragovus> Revenge is all the personality you need Paige
[3:16:34] <RubberFistFight> They're not characters anymore, Paige. They're vehicles for Druckmann to make you feel bad with. Because bad feels = good writing, remember.
[3:16:35] <BinaryShuffle> paige hating women BIG THINK
[3:16:35] <%Conyst> Too quiet
[3:16:35] <Nelsukako> talking seriously here; u guys are not the first ones to not like Diana
[3:16:35] <%questionablemat> pat confirmed horse girl
[3:16:36] <%SirGO0SE> needs more huge swinging nuts
[3:16:36] <BluBox> 420 weed personality
[3:16:37] <+Klonoa__> That horse is so dead dude you have no idea
[3:16:38] <%myriad_truth> Dina isn't that great
[3:16:38] <TheFramedWarlock> Paige still hates women
[3:16:39] <starkandstag> her personality is love interest
[3:16:39] <%Starotter70> Is she JUST there to show that Ellie's gay?
[3:16:39] <%optimasmaximas> yup
[3:16:39] <+Taglog7> But Jesse Tho
[3:16:39] <+DZiffer> probably because they do just random talk with no real impact
[3:16:40] <%ragingbrachy> FeelsBadMan
[3:16:40] <+krymzen5> also yea Ellie lost all of her charm froom 1
[3:16:40] <DCDrewZee> That Horse is going to be glue by the end of this
[3:16:41] <ammobasket> CHAZ now covers the entire US
[3:16:41] <brachydios777> We just met her and they are expecting us to like her
[3:16:42] <cipher758> and that DOG at the beginning
[3:16:42] <+Thanatoast250> Nominate Shimmer for an award for best Supporting Character
[3:16:42] <%Plasmasnake3> WISH THEY HAD A BETTER CHARACTER MAYBE FROM THE PREVIOUS GAME TO PLAY AS
[3:16:42] <+zooeymainbtw> they replaced personality for lesbian
[3:16:43] <Shade075> Chazz it up
[3:16:43] <WholesomeCumiesPeddler> This character dialogue is so bad
[3:16:43] <%chiazamformerlymankeyfigh> PAAAAT, now the horse has to gooo, why you say that
[3:16:43] <%Mister_McDerp> FeelsBadMan
[3:16:44] <%ChestMimik> I struggle to remember Dina's name
[3:16:45] <Solidnick18> Where's the health bar
[3:16:45] <laguerrilha> They are all okish. it feels like the good writer of the first game isnt there anymore
[3:16:46] <Psyramics> so does the Girlfriend
[3:16:47] <Gruhunchously> I'm just saying, at this point in the first game, I was really warming up to Joel and Tess' banter.
[3:16:47] <%Promessa_EX> That's how you write modern media right? No personality just lesbians?
[3:16:48] <BoborRUU> hol horse?
[3:16:49] <+nathandiel> Where are all the monstars
[3:16:49] <+lethallylactic> FeelsBadMan üê¥
[3:16:50] <guyman125> Remember when Ellie was bursting with personality
[3:16:51] <Deimos002> AGRO D:
[3:16:52] <%afronooch> We havent been given a reason to like dina beyond ellie liking dina
[3:16:52] <%ragingbrachy> if you name an animal it dies pat. thems the rules
[3:16:53] <+CSNG> Shimmer is secretly also on a cross country revenge trip

[3:16:54] <pennykettle_> also youve been riding it for months
[3:16:54] <%mysterypork> SHIMMER IS BEST CHARACTER
[3:16:54] <Rigid_Iguana> thats probably like shimmer 3 thh
[3:16:54] <%derap41> Knights tip don't name your horse
[3:16:54] <DE777ON> soon it will be free
[3:16:55] <+TylerMystix> Writers: "Gay is a personality...right?"
[3:16:57] <%ceriani1234> they are gonna make it rape horse before it dies so its fine.
[3:16:57] <%ChestMimik> Wait why did Tommy not want to come again?
[3:16:58] <+TDotGoat> RIP Horse
[3:16:58] <%reinbachthe3rd> Best characterl horse.

Hey Pat, hope the game is at least fun to play cause right now the only thing that's kept me watching is you and Paige. The fact that this will be rated better than Doom Eternal makes me seethe.

[3:19:20] <%czeekyplays> @RyanTheRecluse that's a big oof
[3:19:22] <natebud> I'm noticing that Ellie and Dina are kind of the same character. She's just there so Ellie has someone to talk to.

[3:20:10] <gabagoosh> is tlous remastered good? i tried replaying the original years back, and it wasn't very good.
[3:20:11] <%ZizerX> god it's true
[3:20:11] <%Starotter70> YEAH
[3:20:12] <+Donutjulio> The last game was a bittersweet swash buckling adventure that made an interesting entry in the genre, this is just typical zombie fiction
[3:20:12] <%linSP> Every game David Cage made is more entertaining than this (except omicron)
[3:20:12] <IntrepidEye> So I'm guessing that so far the game is mediocre and the girls personality is basically just "I'm a lesbian"
[3:20:12] <%spiritofmojave> Also accurate!
[3:20:13] <%ChestMimik> Dina doesn't know the murderhobo lifestyle
[3:20:13] <mach01_> I mean, dina saying 'FUCK THEM KIDS' was an amazing moment
[3:20:14] <+rottingpastry> is this an ICE checkpoint?
[3:20:15] <warmnoid> eugene has more personality than them and he's fucking dead
[3:20:16] <%Garthunox> yes
[3:20:17] <+OmegaOcelotOk> No
[3:20:17] <ManfredA> @RubberFistFight nah, he just had competent writers and people to tell him no
[3:20:17] <$adimcorner> he reverse Lucas'ed it. it's like if Spielberg took over the prequels but was just as bad
[3:20:17] <%sjcodan> NOT MY ELLIE
[3:20:18] <waifoong98> yes
[3:20:18] <DavidDredd84> !uptime
[3:20:18] <Samhotdamn> yes
[3:20:18] <@Moobot> I've been playing this game for how long? Oh only 3h 20m.
[3:20:18] <%chiazamformerlymankeyfigh> She's aint no trekker
[3:20:18] <%julrave> probably not
[3:20:18] <+biodomewithpaulyshor> Not at all
[3:20:18] <pennykettle_> youre not very fair
[3:20:19] <knyttstories> yes
[3:20:19] <Vashido22> Yes
[3:20:19] <%tolloponik> Couldn't you steam roll last of us 1 in 4 hours
[3:20:19] <%Starotter70> Yes and No
[3:20:19] <+Insuffrivity> Nope.

[3:20:22] <BeatBo_2> yes
[3:20:22] <%derap41> Eh not really
[3:20:22] <reonome> are you trying pat
[3:20:22] <%dekkitout> Fair enough
[3:20:22] <$shadow1man9> Yes
[3:20:22] <%Piemen99> yes
[3:20:22] <%medusasghost> lol no but its ok
[3:20:22] <%spiritofmojave> You're attempting
[3:20:22] <SolGainer> yes
[3:20:22] <+Klonoa__> you're fine
[3:20:22] <+pkmamsters> not really no
[3:20:23] <+zooeymainbtw> yes
[3:20:23] <GunEden> nope
[3:20:23] <Run44forrest> yes
[3:20:23] <BalloniWright> No
[3:20:23] <%optimasmaximas> @FatherGreyBeard it was part of the leaks, so i knew anyway lol
[3:20:24] <%worldbrand> No, but you're also not wrong
[3:20:24] <RubberFistFight> You're being super fair, this game is fucking trash.
[3:20:24] <%superc37> no, but its finw
[3:20:24] <garbageheaphound> ITS TOUGH
[3:20:24] <Angry_Ev1L> @PatStaresAt BE FAIRER
[3:20:24] <+Psitterrific> I havent seen or heard ellie or dina say something or have any personal reactions to anything yet. Just react to plot points. They have no character
[3:20:24] <fuji_92> no
[3:20:24] <MrDonTacos_> very fair
[3:20:25] <Solidnick18> Yes
[3:20:25] <Phoenon> You could be way worse, yeah
[3:20:25] <red_blaster> NO
[3:20:25] <AnacondaVirtue> You're trying, the game is just hot garbage.
[3:20:26] <Wan6Saber> damn
[3:20:26] <chromonaut747> not really pat
[3:20:26] <%Conyst> Blind sipsipHonk
[3:20:27] <laguerrilha> no, but the game isnt helping
[3:20:27] <natebud> Not really. Lots of pointless nitpicks
[3:20:27] <PlasticJake> no, very fair
[3:20:28] <fierysnowflakes> TRY HARDER
[3:20:28] <benjiFG> gustavo woo
[3:20:28] <%PNPLost_1> It sounds like you ARE trying, but it ain't giving you much.
[3:20:28] <%DappercatEsquire> Eh, not completely, but who cares
[3:20:28] <Frostydough1> no
[3:20:29] <%weissguard> It's not great so far. Unless it's graphicall.
[3:20:29] <%derap41> Gameplay looks good
[3:20:29] <%magnafine> no you aren't fair
[3:20:29] <%consistentlylistless> I don't know
[3:20:29] <%ChestMimik> A little mean to it but I'd say mostly fair
[3:20:30] <studleydoorite> no but it's not great anyway
[3:20:30] <Xeno351> yes but it is bad so far
[3:20:30] <eyezehuhh> no
[3:20:30] <+krymzen5> yes, its been weak on everything but looks
[3:20:31] <%segonian> she's doesn't act like Ellie
[3:20:31] <+Taglog7> The Horses are cool
[3:20:31] <SomeAsianDood> Nope. but it's fine
[3:20:32] <deliverypigcomics> Are you fair to this game Pat? No, no you are not.
[3:20:32] <+artyom47> its it a PRETTY GAME
[3:20:32] <stranger59> Are you ever fair?
[3:20:32] <BoborRUU> music is still good
[3:20:33] <%SirGO0SE> that 100 zombie scene was fucking rad mna
[3:20:33] <nightslink> Yes your fair
[3:20:33] <%KnivesEve> be tougher
[3:20:34] <%aBlueWizard> The sex music was so out of place
[3:20:34] <%Konquerer> more than it deserves
[3:20:34] <%king_wragles> @PatStaresAt If it wasn't for Druckman, you'd probably have less issues
[3:20:34] <%NarshaForever> you really arent trying and it shows
[3:20:34] <RayCSmooth> You don't need to be
[3:20:34] <+masked_hero_lucky> Pat, after hearing new spoilers, you have no reason to be fair to this game
[3:20:35] <%spiritofmojave> I LIKE ABBY'S JUMP
[3:20:36] <Badgerconda_> GRAFFIX DOOD
[3:20:36] <redlanternreviews> I could not tell you a single thing about Dina besides "She's dating Ellie"
[3:20:36] <%DeadlyPeaks> I felt more emotion during Uncharted 4, this game just feels off
[3:20:36] <%Pookiedaexzile> Member when Eliie was a little shit who make fun of everything
[3:20:37] <%ABigPinkLion> the art team have A LOT to be proud of
[3:20:37] <SGrim> Abby is the hero we've always needed.
[3:20:37] <lessthanhuman_tv> The tension building is pretty good
[3:20:37] <+TruSanKyuu> I like the horse
[3:20:38] <$autcetera> Shoutout to 1) Druckman, who is the living embodiment of farts, and 2) the manlets who freaked out when the leaks were made
[3:20:39] <Them00n> Environment design is good
[3:20:39] <+OwlLightningMage> You aren't being fair but it still sucks LUL
[3:20:39] <%dinnydanny777> We've traveled hundreds of miles but Ellie is somehow still mad
[3:20:41] <snipsnoopyouvebeendooped> I like Jesse
[3:20:41] <KokujinDo> those have nothing to do with the plot.
[3:20:42] <+DiabloDeAzul> HE HATES IT LUL
[3:20:42] <%possumwalsh1221> you‚Äôre being VERY fair I promise
[3:20:42] <%UvBenServed> Better be after all that crunchin
[3:20:43] <+Donutjulio> The graphics BETTER look good with how much crunch the team went through
[3:20:43] <%JenovasPuppet> I like how it subverted my expectations
[3:20:43] <%SaiyanShoto> You‚Äôre being fair
[3:20:44] <LtSolo> but the game wants you to care about the story, which is hard to do
[3:20:44] <%flechet> you fair pat but this writing aint great
[3:20:44] <scrashman> How's the frame rate?
[3:20:44] <%EuropanLamprey> So the gameplay and graphics are good, the writing sucks?
[3:20:45] <+nekodelic> absolutely not fair tbh
[3:20:45] <%chiazamformerlymankeyfigh> If Ellie MAKES ONE PUN, I'LL BE SURPRISED
[3:20:46] <jorniev> not really
[3:20:46] <silverira> Combat is to forgiving
[3:20:46] <Tonicky > I like that UP truck
[3:20:47] <ManfredA> this game doesn't deserve it
[3:20:48] <%1buckboom> Yeah can't fault the graphics. Looks real good
[3:20:48] <Poncho_Freestyle> apart from the horror music that played during the sex scene monkaS
[3:20:48] <HODGETASTROPHE> Stranger Things With Zombos
[3:20:48] <%ChestMimik> It's got genuine laughs out of us
[3:20:49] <DatAsuna> I like muscles, I just prefer them n fun characters
[3:20:49] <+I_of_the_Storm> The RE4 finisher earlier was cool.
[3:20:51] <%SnackinOnChimps> how does it feel?
[3:20:52] <%hzealot> @PatStaresAt but a turd story covered in sparkles is still just a shiny turd
[3:20:52] <%SirGO0SE> the bane of modern games
[3:20:53] <+meattube1> most people arent fair to it
[3:20:53] <Jolly_Adventurer> All the acting is great
[3:20:54] <%Faustgesicht> but is it fun?
[3:20:55] <%Starotter70> Cause Gamplay is fun = Bad
[3:20:55] <%blackbaron98> It seems just like the first
[3:20:56] <+NotSoAccurateNo1> they have about as much personality as any main cast member of a B horror film
[3:20:56] <%czeekyplays> So, basically all the devs/progs who were crunched did great, directing and writing was shit? Sounds about right
[3:20:56] <+FatherGreyBeard> whats the WLF
[3:20:56] <+alucard929> Alright boys, how far in are we?
[3:20:56] <%ceriani1234> looks mean nothing without substance
[3:20:57] <PlasticJake> this game feels like it was made by a hack-fraud who didn't get the point of the first game
[3:20:58] <Nelsukako> no, you are not being fair, but fuck it, we dont wanna be either. Lets have fun with this garbage
[3:20:58] <+guyremex> i can see the work abuse in the graphics
[3:20:58] <%Nupinoop296> i have more appreciation for the modelers and texture artists than anyone else on this dev team
[3:20:59] <%ChestMimik> Like the bongmask
[3:20:59] <AnacondaVirtue> Left them there? They're fucking skeletons
[3:20:59] <%MSN04_Sazabi> I like golf
[3:21:00] <%sniffy77> i mean where else would they put them?
[3:21:00] <+Chewygamer> So the question is: can you forgive a AAA game with shitty writing?
[3:21:00] <Tiddlebonk> Check out these dope-ass crunch graphics! Some poor bastard worked sixteen hours a day on these!
[3:21:00] <%Dementedpenguin> The last action scene was an hour ago
[3:21:00] <%Purple_badger3000> It's pretty but it's the same as the last game
[3:21:00] <natebud> The constant nitpicks are kind of distracting from actual problems.
[3:21:00] <+KilogramHours> @PatStaresAt Are there even Zombies in this game?
[3:21:00] <RubberFistFight> @ManfredA I wasn't making that up, dude. He's on record as saying how much of a positive influence she's had on his life and how he didn't even know he was a misogynist before he met ehr.
[3:21:01] <+rabidclone> silky smooth locked 30
[3:21:01] <%mield916> It would take 10 days or so to travel from jackson to Seattle
[3:21:03] <+imtth> How long does it take to skeletonize?
[3:21:04] <%Promessa_EX> There's barely any and they already killed your favorite charcter
[3:21:04] <Klarrann3> how's the jump?
[3:21:04] <%JenovasPuppet> Oh and I liked the UPS truck. That was the best part.
[3:21:04] <+rottingpastry> Washington Liberation Front
[3:21:04] <%Pyroclase> why are they setting up the WLF as super-evil??
[3:21:05] <+krymzen5> it runs crazy well

[3:21:50] <Ace_Flibble> They modelled the guitars well, and that kiss was better animated than most in games. The voice acting has been mostly alright.
[3:21:50] <+artyom47> the character design is pretty good. i havent seen a lot of diffent enemy designs but they look good so far

[3:22:17] <$vincerocmm> me
[3:22:17] <%ChestMimik> It wasn't THAT hard
[3:22:18] <%sjcodan> It says SPOILERS in the title
[3:22:18] <%DesertPenguin> They chose not to
[3:22:19] <%Pookiedaexzile> So they Came HERE
[3:22:19] <%arcanemacrocosm> meeeeeee
[3:22:19] <+NinjaWitaSniper> Paige who cares about spoilers, this game is a travesty lmao, it doesnt deserve respect
[3:22:19] <%segonian> it's ok to hate sometimes Paige
[3:22:20] <%Roasted_Pheasant> I haven't been spoiled on most of it
[3:22:20] <BioApple> this incident is ellie's albatross
[3:22:20] <%NarshaForever> by the time you are in this game atm, the only personality ellie had was being a whiny baby
[3:22:20] <gabagoosh> no one seems to know more spoilers after this, no?
[3:22:20] <%derap41> Goodded baby
[3:22:20] <dukenux> Driver Abby
[3:22:21] <%ABigPinkLion> I didn't get spoiled and I thank you for shutting them up
[3:22:21] <@PeachSaliva> @zooeymainbtw no I wont
[3:22:21] <OneThousandTomatoes> LIKE ME
[3:22:21] <%walternatorz> i HAVE AN INNOCENT HEART.
[3:22:22] <%myriad_truth> I wasn't spoiled and it sucks hard!!!
[3:22:22] <%IminyourBase> FEDRA IS NOT FEMA
[3:22:22] <SilverJakler> The gameplay looks fine, graphics are fantastic but the story is very bad so far
[3:22:23] <bigcitrus7> Haha, Ellie your girlfriend is awesome
[3:22:23] <%CookieCutter007> my heart is broken FeelsBadMan
[3:22:23] <%ragingbrachy> yeah that is cool
[3:22:23] <BluBox> Oh fuck, you're making me wanna golf
[3:22:23] <%chambatron> I did because I don't care about this game
[3:22:23] <%SinisterBroccoli> Well I just didn't really care
[3:22:23] <+Taglog7> I should play Hot Shot golf again
[3:22:24] <%Starotter70> Just saw that Joel in One vid, that's fucking great
[3:22:25] <%superc37> their stupid, innocent hears
[3:22:26] <+Freeborg23> Yeah, wasn't spoiled at all
[3:22:26] <%ospreyworks> Holy shit, they killed him off fast, huh?
[3:22:27] <+smellmycowbro> @PatStaresAt How would you compare this to Last of Us original?
[3:22:27] <RinWR> I mean it was mostly out of uncare
[3:22:27] <%questionablemat> na i am the big lazy
[3:22:27] <rissaleigh14> Like me
[3:22:28] <%NarshaForever> took time for to evolve
[3:22:28] <@ShockzNDrawe> I wasn't spoiled cuz I don't go looking for that and scream if someone throws it to me
[3:22:29] <BrachyZoid> oh yeah I forgot there are Zombies
[3:22:29] <+Parrish_broadnax> hi yes me
[3:22:30] <%ragingbrachy> there is?
[3:22:30] <%dinnydanny777> @liquiddinosaur Yeah like I get it but staying angry while travelling hundreds of miles over weeks is probably pretty difficult, also I just realised Abby traveled halfway across the country too? People just take cross country trips in the apocalypse?
[3:22:31] <%Purple_badger3000> My friend gaveu up and asked me about the spoilers then decided to not buy the game
[3:22:32] <%spiritofmojave> Props to you guys for dodging hard on the spoils
[3:22:32] <%Reilata> I haven't looked at a thing. So all new to me.
[3:22:32] <%CalderGaming> zombie FUNGUE
[3:22:32] <$Sphincter_Spelunker> @Tucker0603 Abby killed Joel with a club
[3:22:32] <olaksi> The secret to not being spoiled is not to give a fuck about TLOU2
[3:22:32] <+NightSkye09> I wasn't spoiled, and I'm still not surprised
[3:22:33] <%amiavamp> This story doesn't even need zombies
[3:22:33] <+nathandiel> Paige would be at home in 1984
[3:22:34] <%chiazamformerlymankeyfigh> STAGES OF INFECTION
[3:22:34] <%ChestMimik> You just don't go to pages with big spoils on it
[3:22:35] <Shwepie> Parasite?
[3:22:37] <+Thanatoast250> I am #Blessed
[3:22:37] <%Coffee_JD> Why would it need to explain that? ITS A SEQUEL
[3:22:38] <%derap41> Its a sequel they kinda assum it
[3:22:38] <%cvp5127> member zombies
[3:22:38] <%consistentlylistless> Monstars??
[3:22:38] <%Prism_Wing> Other people's needs? Ridiculous.
[3:22:38] <laguerrilha> Its a sequel so its fine
[3:22:39] <Salty_Panda> wait, Joel dies? Kappa
[3:22:39] <%restingbones> It shouldn't have to explain, its a sequal.
[3:22:40] <+Shady_Zaku> ITS A SEQUEL
[3:22:40] <%afronooch> I didnt but idrc care about tlou2
[3:22:40] <%marvel877> Wait, zombies are still a thing in this game?
[3:22:41] <xenprecs> Yeah I somehow made it up till now spoiler free
[3:22:41] <+condemned_15> this was in the first game but the bloater section was ripped
[3:22:41] <thewhiterice92> ME bless meeeee
[3:22:42] <%urdumb4twitching> its a sequel
[3:22:42] <%honeyman18> Respect the ignorant for they know not the pain to come.
[3:22:42] <A_Red_Robot> gigaboOtsBani
[3:22:43] <%BinaryFireball> YOU TOTALLY PLAYED THE FIRST GAME RIGHT?
[3:22:44] <%ElenaManetta> They assume everyone is a fan
[3:22:44] <%iosephe> It is a sequel
[3:22:44] <SummonerMagno> i wasnt spoiled, but honestly it was cause i just didnt care
[3:22:44] <%Dragovus> BARRY IT'S A MONSTER!
[3:22:45] <CaptRose> How is it Joel in One? She hit him like 5 times it's at least a bogey
[3:22:45] <%lemon_rinds> I did my best to be unspoilerfied
[3:22:46] <+biodomewithpaulyshor> It's called The Last of Us Part 2 though. They don't need it
[3:22:46] <%julrave> ehhh playing two without one seems like fair that they're not holding your hand
[3:22:47] <fuji_92> this is the second game tho
[3:22:47] <+visidan> its a sequel bro
[3:22:47] <%dekkitout> @olaksi Bingo
[3:22:48] <benjiFG> hope you played the first game lol
[3:22:48] <%ragingbrachy> well you played the first one 4Head
[3:22:48] <%JusTTheGuyYouNeed> its a sequel
[3:22:48] <%Pookiedaexzile> No it's not Fine
[3:22:48] <cipher758> the mushroom people!
[3:22:49] <mach01_> i mean it is a sequel to a game of the year, cmon
[3:22:49] <R3c0n31> It is a SEQUEL in any defense
[3:22:49] <%Garthunox> they really assumed you played the last one 5 minutes before
[3:22:50] <+krymzen5> this game seems to expect you to be very familar with the 1sts lure
[3:22:50] <%FluffiTamamo> Cuz the real monsters are the HUMAAANS
[3:22:52] <%Starotter70> "You played the first game, we don't need to take the time to explain"
[3:22:52] <stranger59> You played part 1
[3:22:52] <%xxshadowxx416> ea do the bad thing
[3:22:52] <%restingbones> Irrelevant Pat, its a sequal
[3:22:52] <%CommanderSqueaks> sequel
[3:22:53] <%bevyrage> the most that the game gives you is 'oh man so many infected sightings recently' and THAT IS IT
[3:22:53] <%possumwalsh1221> Oh yeah by the way zambos
[3:22:54] <Tucker0603> @sphincter_spelunker oh, that sucks....
[3:22:55] <+Donutjulio> There's been only recap for the ending of the first game, cause from this games point of view its the only thing that mattered
[3:22:56] <+OmegaOcelotOk> Its a Sequel tho
[3:22:56] <%dinnydanny777> Apparently cordyceps is so small an issue now that people take trips cross country
[3:22:56] <+nekodelic> It's the second game tho
[3:22:56] <collind99> It‚Äôs a sequel
[3:22:57] <+Insuffrivity> "PART II" God, why don't they explain the infection.
[3:22:57] <+rottingpastry> Eh, you come into a game called "GAME TITLE 2" you takes what you gets.
[3:22:57] <rissaleigh14> Play the first game yo
[3:22:57] <%Onmi_Khaos> Seriously how are there still Stage 1's left?
[3:23:01] <+TheBigTaco> Its a sequel
[3:23:01] <%worldbrand> they shouldn't need to provide answers to people choosing to hop in at 2 lol
[3:23:01] <+sixcubit> what idiots are still getting infected?
[3:23:02] <redlanternreviews> I feel bad because my firend is legitimately excited for this game and I just don't have the heart to tell him how dull the first like 2 hours have been and how bad it is
[3:23:04] <%debugdrawray_> you can still contextualize things in a sequel its good writing to do so\
[3:23:04] <%derap41> That is a baby
[3:23:04] <%amiavamp> Truly, We Are The Walking Last of Dead
[3:23:04] <supersparta12345> I mean, you ripped on that one guy for not understanding DMC 5
[3:23:05] <asbestos_man45> ResidentSleeper ResidentSleeper
[3:23:05] <SomeAsianDood> ACIDIC PROJECTILES?!?!
[3:23:06] <+masked_hero_lucky> To be fair, there's no reason to play this game if you haven't played the first, that big 2 in the title should make that obvious. At that point it's the player's fault
[3:23:07] <+Psitterrific> I wasnt spoiled. Because I actively avoid press from games I want to buy. This has made me not want to. uy
[3:23:07] <ExpressNode> !uptime
[3:23:08] <OneThousandTomatoes> @peachsaliva Thanks for preventing spoilers
[3:23:08] <Poncho_Freestyle> ECHO LOCATION atpCap
[3:23:08] <@Moobot> I've been playing this game for how long? Oh only 3h 23m.
[3:23:08] <+zepelinnn1> you still should set the tone in a sequel
[3:23:09] <auraofdawn> people are dumb enough to pick this up without playing the first one tho
[3:23:09] <%Pappajimbo> boomer
[3:23:09] <%Pookiedaexzile> SEQUELS SHOULD STAND ALONE. THIS WHY WE NEED ANN
[3:23:10] <%ChestMimik> Is it just me or did the first game have more action going on by now
[3:23:10] <%possumwalsh1221> You‚Äôre just supposed to KNOW pat psaSmug
[3:23:11] <@PeachSaliva> @nathandiel I‚Äôm just trying to make sure everyone enjoys this or at least attempts to. Chill
[3:23:12] <%dinnydanny777> Everyone should be boomers
[3:23:12] <KokujinDo> the human are the real monsters...despite the monsters being super monstrous
[3:23:14] <MrDonTacos_> "we are the real monsters" 10/10
[3:23:16] <ingvarbergman> wait it's actually just the real mushroom cordyceps?
[3:23:19] <RunningNGunning> shhhhh
[3:23:20] <+krymzen5> like dolphins
[3:23:21] <neekocheeko> like batman
[3:23:21] <laguerrilha> yeah
[3:23:22] <%aBlueWizard> yup
[3:23:24] <Lutre> they hear and then they see
[3:23:24] <%SinisterBroccoli> are they bats?
[3:23:24] <+thackattack00> that isnt how that works
[3:23:25] <%Das_Bass> yup
[3:23:26] <$lotharrio> No that's not... shut up though.
[3:23:27] <%Warbot40> that's real
[3:23:27] <SolGainer> shhhhhhhhh
[3:23:28] <%AEUG_Ace_Kamille> I feel really bad. My roommate loved the first game because it's good BUT ALSO his name is Joel so it got him a bit deeper. He's gonna fucking flip.
[3:23:28] <bakkatohri> They're based on real life parasites that infect bugs. Like there's no explanation for why these exist, they just are. Just call it evolution or whatever.
[3:23:29] <%iosephe> STAB THAT CAGE
[3:23:29] <+Skwizgarr> @PatStaresAt maybe it's really shitty echolocation
[3:23:29] <%ZizerX> uh ignore that
[3:23:29] <%IminyourBase> NO STFU PAT YOU'RE MAKING SENSE
[3:23:29] <%myriad_truth> Thats how echolocation works
[3:23:30] <$Sphincter_Spelunker> @Tucker0603 Someone hit the nail on the head earlier, this feels like a 3rd act and we're 2-ish hours in
[3:23:30] <Nelsukako> lets talk about something more interesting; have you see Kaguya love is war pat ? is cute as fuck
[3:23:31] <%ElenaManetta> Woolie is playing Paper Mario!
[3:23:33] <%worldbrand> they're also bad at haering Kappa
[3:23:33] <natebud> whatever
[3:23:33] <DatAsuna> I guess cover bounces the sound?
[3:23:34] <%toastybites> shhh ignore science just feel bad
[3:23:34] <%possumwalsh1221> True LUL
[3:23:35] <%spiritofmojave> Echolocation like bats, yes
[3:23:35] <+mcjimbo12> thackattack00 it is though
[3:23:36] <+alucard929> That would be unfun to play to SHHHH
[3:23:36] <BoborRUU> they should just say they have super hearing, not echolocation
[3:23:37] <gabagoosh> this game desperately needed straley as the director.
[3:23:37] <%consistentlylistless> First they hear it then they see it
[3:23:38] <%derap41> Clickers should notice you immediately maybe they just shit at echo locating
[3:23:38] <%spiritofmojave> or dolphins
[3:23:38] <%hzealot> @PatStaresAt do you have any idea where one could find a source for the writers saying cross country revenge would be dumb for TLOU?
[3:23:39] <%CalderGaming> @ingvarbergman it's a fictional form of cordyceps yes
[3:23:39] <%stagemage> eh its called a part 2, on the other hand yakuza put in big reviews so fuck it
[3:23:39] <rubbishbinge> shhh mushrooms can only detect movement
[3:23:40] <OneThousandTomatoes> ?
[3:23:41] <+nekodelic> @Pookiedaexzile stand alone in quality, not didacticism
[3:23:41] <%bluefooddye1> Echolocation is not the same as good hearing
[3:23:42] <+rottingpastry> Dina is smarter than you, Pat
[3:23:42] <olaksi> "But who are the real mushrooms really?"
[3:23:42] <%myriad_truth> Stop making sense Pat!
[3:23:44] <+ratreborn> Unchated ladder prompt
[3:23:44] <jorniev> what was the name of the big dick hero in the previous game, ishmail ?
[3:23:44] <+Neoepochx> @PatStaresAt I mean, why would they need to explain the Universe? How could you NOT have played the oscar worthy TLoU1? What are you a game hater?
[3:23:44] <+rabidclone> ok.
[3:23:45] <Vashido22> @PatStaresAt Did you see they're selling the game's guitar at 2300 dollars?
[3:23:45] <BinaryShuffle> Just because they click doesn't mean they have echolocation
[3:23:45] <%LiquidDinosaur> @AEUG_Ace_Kamille dont tell Abby his name is Joel
[3:23:47] <+meatmaaan> stop making sense when videogames
[3:23:47] <%Campfire_Chronicles> the game seems like it assumes that anyone playing it loved the 1st one and remembers it clearly
[3:23:47] <%bigboy3d> Hey it's Uncharted now!
[3:23:48] <+MrWrann> If you just had a white noise recording or something would that fuck up a clikers sense of location?
[3:23:49] <CyborgAV> Why the fuck does Ellie just parkour with a knife out?
[3:23:49] <%floralkami> that isn't hit that works, they don't get THAT super hearing
[3:23:50] <+TheBigTaco> Standing alone doesn‚Äôt mean having to explain the world that it has already explained in the previous game
[3:23:52] <%chiazamformerlymankeyfigh> That's not how echolocation works - SOME GUY AT ND
[3:23:53] <%ceriani1234> DAME DA NE
[3:23:54] <$RealThiele> o k
[3:23:54] <+SolidusRex> I want to know Echo the Dolphin's location
[3:23:54] <%derap41> Maybe clickers just aren't that good at echo location
[3:23:54] <@SoFarFetched> Remember there are those who have avoided spoilers/leaks of this game,so please don't ruin it for others in this chat.
[3:23:54] <twoto858> Classic
[3:23:58] <+Radalorian> @PatStaresAt Have you noticed that Abby has some Schwarzenegger sized hands? You could say she's got some real "Arnold Palmers"!
[3:23:58] <asbestos_man45> Thanx Dean
[3:23:59] <Ipsenscastle> It would be better if it was 'don't move while they're clicking'
[3:24:01] <%Ganerumo> who sprinkled nuclear fertilizer on those trees for getting this huge in 25 years
[3:24:03] <Tucker0603> @sphincter_spelunker yeah, I knew it would be bad, but not this bad
[3:24:03] <Run44forrest> i mean wouldnt that suck to play
[3:24:05] <cipher758> Dino!
[3:24:06] <%czeekyplays> thanks @SoFarFetched
[3:24:07] <+OwlLightningMage> it's really bad
[3:24:07] <%JenovasPuppet> Ellie needed Dina with her because everything in the post-apocalypse requires two people.
[3:24:08] <%optimasmaximas> hmmm
[3:24:09] <Jackabyte> @Nelsukako The episode with the moon is amazing
[3:24:09] <%Starotter70> HMMMMMMMM
[3:24:11] <%ElenaManetta> Tests torturing Joel?
[3:24:12] <reonome> HMMMMMM
[3:24:14] <%dinnydanny777> Oh I wonder who wrote that
[3:24:16] <mar_krow> Hey guys we made some changes to some enemies that‚Äôs all
[3:24:17] <%optimasmaximas> LUL
[3:24:19] <ExpressNode> Shit I missed some of the stream from having to stay after work for dumb customers
[3:24:20] <+lethallylactic> LUL
[3:24:21] <%GarbageQueenEllie> Oh shit. Oh SHIT. We doing this?!!?
[3:24:21] <+Malacious> LUL
[3:24:21] <$Dakuu75> test-torture?
[3:24:23] <%Valdorick> That is what hacks do.
[3:24:23] <%floralkami> @patstaresat just because they click doesn't mean they have echo location
[3:24:23] <%dinnydanny777> I wonder whose idea that was hmmm
[3:24:24] <%ragingbrachy> wait what
[3:24:25] <%boomstickery> its a shit cliched hack polt
[3:24:25] <+krymzen5> like druckman took his chance to make HIS vission
[3:24:25] <%consistentlylistless> Put him in the David Cage
[3:24:26] <emeraldskrull> all i want is for pat to get dunked on so hard that he feels slightly embarrassed. Is that too much to ask? woolieTRASH
[3:24:26] <%derap41> Hey after the success he got whatever he wanted
[3:24:26] <SolGainer> MY GAME NOW CHUMPS
[3:24:28] <%Conyst> Excellent knife safety jumping with it open
[3:24:29] <%eanscrale> fun
[3:24:29] <$RealThiele> Leftovers of us
[3:24:29] <%Pookiedaexzile> YO.... TYPE IN LAST OF US 1 WRITER, THEY ERASED HER FROM THE WIKI
[3:24:30] <%IminyourBase> don't fuck with the druck
[3:24:30] <Nelsukako> it is so fuckin adorable. I love that episode
[3:24:30] <Phoenon> He got cuckman'd out of his first gore porn aspirations
[3:24:30] <%Nupinoop296> NotLikeThis
[3:24:30] <%Nope80808> REDUCE REUSE RECYCLE
[3:24:31] <Andrizzleton> the LEAST necessary story
[3:24:31] <%dinnydanny777> Egotism
[3:24:32] <OneThousandTomatoes> Her hands aren't wrapping around the rungs
[3:24:32] <%Pappajimbo> though what causes all infected gaining ecolocation
[3:24:32] <%possumwalsh1221> LUL LUL LUL LUL LUL
[3:24:33] <+BeezusHrist> Just so you guys know, Amy Hennig is just as committed to diversity as Neil Druckman is so I would not point to that committment as a reason for bad story telling in this game @PatStaresAt
[3:24:34] <%bevyrage> yeah it certainly looks and feels that way for sure
[3:24:34] <%EtheralFlameX> It like kojima but he's not a good writter
[3:24:35] <mach01_> HOLY SHIT ELLIE WHAT ARE YOU DOING MAKING THAT JUMP
[3:24:36] <+OntarioJake> why the fuck is she wearing converse
[3:24:37] <+alucard929> Oh goody.
[3:24:37] <+Insuffrivity> Precarious af
[3:24:37] <Angry_Ev1L> REVENGE IS BAD U HEAR ME
[3:24:37] <$shadow1man9> Neil has a torture fetish confirmed
[3:24:38] <%czeekyplays> @GarbageQueenEllie indeed, your pungeantcy
[3:24:40] <%ElenaManetta> YOU SHOULDVE FALLEN
[3:24:40] <catwithsunglasses> It should be noted that I don't dislike this game so far for the events that have happened, it's because I can feel them asking me to feel emotions they haven't earned yet
[3:24:40] <%derap41> Star Writer Gets what Star Writer wants
[3:24:40] <%myriad_truth> They said they see by echolocation
[3:24:41] <%hzealot> @PatStaresAt thank you pat because of what you said I really wanted to look into it and maybe do a snarky write-up
[3:24:44] <thegusbus90210> Neil is getting his NUT and you can‚Äôt stop him
[3:24:44] <asbestos_man45> Nice landing animation
[3:24:45] <%hahaha1171> that's petty
[3:24:45] <neekocheeko> epic platforming
[3:24:47] <+DZiffer> They just gonna leave their horse behind?
[3:24:48] <%chiazamformerlymankeyfigh> YEAH THIS IS SAFE
[3:24:48] <%Pappajimbo> and not just being blind?
[3:24:49] <khalcatto> The Last of Us 2 is a story driven game where everything but the story is good
[3:24:50] <%ElenaManetta> You did NOT make that jump
[3:24:50] <dante07061947> 70% of ND employees left after U4
[3:24:51] <%ElenaManetta> FUUUCKK
[3:24:52] <JPstudmuffin> They also made him VP of ND.
[3:24:52] <%ragingbrachy> oof
[3:24:52] <%YakumoYomi> A classic case of "no one to rein in the Director's bullshit"?
[3:24:53] <laguerrilha> He probably fired everyone that could say it was bad
[3:24:54] <lessthanhuman_tv> i kind of understand them approaching this from a 'yeah it's part 2, we don't need to reexplain things" but the pacing here is baffling
[3:24:54] <%Onmi_Khaos> It is 2020
[3:24:54] <reonome> @Pookiedaexzile amy wasn't involved in tlou
[3:24:57] <%GarbageQueenEllie> @czeekyplays Glad I tuned in! Let's get miserable!
[3:24:57] <%Onmi_Khaos> 20 fuckin' 20
[3:24:57] <am_omega> The thing that gets me the most about that scene is the Neil Druckman character SPITTING ON JOEL.
[3:24:58] <%spiritofmojave> WHAT WAS YOUR PLAN
[3:24:58] <%questionablemat> so he Lucased it
[3:24:58] <+ragingbrachy> ???
[3:24:58] <Psyramics> dats a big bruise
[3:24:59] <+garbotrasho> this bitch super mario
[3:24:59] <%Das_Bass> Why would Tess want to kill Joel @PatStaresAt
[3:25:00] <Amardeux> DA EMOTIONS
[3:25:00] <%derap41> Man where's a good plank when you need one
[3:25:00] <%possumwalsh1221> I bet Neil loves the movie The Room
[3:25:00] <redlanternreviews> Neil is literally just reusing his old idea from the first game that everyone told him were bad
[3:25:01] <+lethallylactic> ???
[3:25:02] <%Stevennapalm> jeez joel
[3:25:03] <+krymzen5> uncharted platforms
[3:25:03] <%LegendGHT> Ellie had a stinkface there
[3:25:03] <%JenovasPuppet> Not like she could get up.
[3:25:03] <pennykettle_> this game feels like it is way too late. this is a 2014 game
[3:25:03] <%fromnibelheim> ouch
[3:25:04] <%aBlueWizard> time to watch duringa work meeting! I wish you luck pat.
[3:25:05] <%lemon_rinds> Neil loves to torture people both in and out of fiction

[3:25:05] <mach01_> DINA IS A COWARD
[3:25:05] <%beansoup> what was the point in that balancing mechanic?
[3:25:06] <OneThousandTomatoes> uncharted
[3:25:06] <%reinbachthe3rd> She said she's keeping lookout.

[3:25:07] <%Onmi_Khaos> And we're STILL DOING BALANCE BEAMS
[3:25:08] <Andrizzleton> >balance beams in current year
[3:25:08] <Kraigerex1> wow that was such a spooky cutscene
[3:25:09] <KokujinDo> ...why do I feel establishing a government as fast as possible would solve this series?

[3:25:12] <$vincerocmm> why
[3:25:13] <ClumzyDragon> to show you how high you are
[3:25:13] <+Insuffrivity> Because there was no way up?

[3:25:15] <yourliteraldog> The SCHINDLERS LIst of Video Games.

[3:25:20] <%reinbachthe3rd> She's waiting for you to open gate.
[3:25:20] <%ZizerX> she never went up

[3:25:20] <+pkmamsters> she never went up
[3:25:21] <%crimsonphoenix69> to be there for emotional support Pat
[3:25:21] <+Skwizgarr> youre opening the door for you
[3:25:21] <%trustycoyote> Ellie got boosted up @PatStaresAt
[3:25:21] <SomeAsianDood> That's where the script was pat
[3:25:21] <coracor> Pat...
[3:25:22] <%CappuccinoGuil> No way for her to go up
[3:25:22] <+joshujoestar> @patstaresat aren't there movies that have gone to shit cause they let directors do the same
[3:25:22] <%IminyourBase> whimsical
[3:25:23] <%crimsonphoenix69> come on
[3:25:24] <TrashLeviathan> she didnt go up pat
[3:25:24] <laguerrilha> Stair is to short
[3:25:24] <%SvenHolgersson> HOW CAN SHE SLAP{
[3:25:24] <%urdumb4twitching> how much longer is this game?
[3:25:24] <%spiritofmojave> she was always there watching the horse
[3:25:24] <%dinnydanny777> This really is just Uncharted
[3:25:25] <OpenMikeLive> Dina isn't blessed with the Uncharted powers
[3:25:26] <%myriad_truth> I miss Tess
[3:25:26] <%shieldecho> she's waiting for Ellie to get to the other side and open the gate
[3:25:26] <timblenaut> Araki forgot
[3:25:26] <%CommanderSqueaks> pat
[3:25:27] <%spiritofmojave> I think
[3:25:27] <+MrWrann> Why did you not just make a grappling hook by this point
[3:25:27] <+artyom47> LUL weird animation
[3:25:28] <+MediocreHermits> she was never up
[3:25:28] <%dashmatt> fuck Seattle
[3:25:28] <%PanicSwytch> WHO'S GONNA BOOST HER PAT
[3:25:28] <%possumwalsh1221> Cause she‚Äôs baby
[3:25:29] <auraofdawn> It‚Äôs ok the turnover at ND is so bad that nobody who remembers the first plot is still there
[3:25:29] <%Engwithan_Elder_God> She's waiting for you to open the gate.
[3:25:30] <%Campfire_Chronicles> @das_bass original script probably had Joel betray her in some way.
[3:25:30] <thegusbus90210> psaBlep
[3:25:30] <blackkanye> Jesus pat is stressing me the fuck out man
[3:25:30] <%LegendGHT> birds for scale
[3:25:31] <%chiazamformerlymankeyfigh> WELCOME TO SEATTLE
[3:25:32] <sabbo23> your opening the gate for her
[3:25:32] <%floralkami> @patstaresat she never went up
[3:25:32] <Frostydough1> "fair shot" btw
[3:25:33] <+Shubreaker> watch this game win 0 awards
[3:25:33] <%driemen> did we kill any dogs yet
[3:25:33] <%czeekyplays> @GarbageQueenEllie you missed some... uh ... "cutscenes"
[3:25:33] <ExpressNode> @patstaresat So how are you enjoying the game so far?
[3:25:35] <$lotharrio> Their society already fell apart?
[3:25:36] <theMeNiNBlack6> they be got got
[3:25:37] <BreakersAweigh> so how we feeling about the game so far chat?
[3:25:38] <%einheri> wtf that animation
[3:25:39] <%NarshaForever> pat alot of your criticism is you not paying attention at all XD
[3:25:39] <Mexrage> kinda remind me that on the first drafts of FF12, Penelo was suppose to betray you, and you end up killing her @PatStaresAt
[3:25:39] <%M4T1A5> The gate
[3:25:40] <+FatherGreyBeard> probably becaues they were zombified i guess
[3:25:40] <%derap41> pat I think the military fucked up after you left
[3:25:40] <%ragingbrachy> no one would dare approach The Gate
[3:25:42] <akosinoogie> ayo, shoutout to my fellow kaguya-sama: love is wsr fans here in tbe chat
[3:25:43] <collind99> she‚Äôs waiting for you to open gate
[3:25:44] <%Onmi_Khaos> Ellie just fell there, she didn't jump down
[3:25:44] <%myriad_truth> IT SUCKS!!!
[3:25:44] <%Coffee_JD> how long before we can kill dogs?
[3:25:44] <+Trent1318> because they figured they would see the sign then turn around cirSmug
[3:25:47] <+TheMatrix1012> snake eater
[3:25:47] <dukenux> How does she know they went back to Seattle?
[3:25:47] <%GarbageQueenEllie> @czeekyplays Dammit! I missed the scissoring.
[3:25:48] <+nekodelic> I still don't get what is so bad about this first two hours of game
[3:25:50] <Run44forrest> STILL IN A DREAM
[3:25:51] <+Kataiser> God this game's awful.
[3:25:52] <neekocheeko> @Shubreaker nah itll win a bunch. naughty dog can put whatever out and win
[3:25:52] <%CommanderSqueaks> @breakersaweigh 6/10
[3:25:55] <%Bailey__gaming> what a thrill
[3:25:56] <+Radalorian> How wild would it be if you just got sniped standing at the top of the wall and had to finish the game as Dina
[3:25:56] <Probroscis> I'm still waiting for the dog flashback
[3:25:56] <%aBlueWizard> Gameplay is a failure of the game design
[3:25:57] <%JenovasPuppet> BRICK
[3:25:58] <+krymzen5> its been very gp light tbh
[3:25:58] <%MidnightBurst12> pup snuffing is at a minimum
[3:25:59] <Jackabyte> @BreakersAweigh Where are the zombies
[3:25:59] <%Onmi_Khaos> her body weight moved to fall, she had her legs out to the side, and then she course corrected in mid air
[3:26:00] <OneThousandTomatoes> I hate her thumbs on the ladder
[3:26:01] <mamabedlam> I'm enjoying it a little but if I paid $60? I'd be pissed.
[3:26:01] <$RealThiele> walking simulator atm
[3:26:01] <%flechet> its filled with zombies due to the evil of REVENGE
[3:26:02] <%JenovasPuppet> The game is saved by BRICK
[3:26:02] <Kraigerex1> I bet they don't close the gate once they get in.
[3:26:02] <%doc_ock_rokc> Druckman used mankinds script for last of us now he is all on his own and it sucks
[3:26:07] <%SvenHolgersson> ARE YOU FEELING THINGS YET PAT
[3:26:07] <%julrave> at least Ellie's GF is pretty ride or die I appreciate that about her
[3:26:08] <+lethallylactic> You mean it's not the Schindler's List of video games? @PatStaresAt
[3:26:08] <+OwlLightningMage> The narrative is terrible so fae
[3:26:09] <%myriad_truth> I miss Tess so much now.
[3:26:09] <%czeekyplays> @GarbageQueenEllie that's definitely what I'm referencing ;)
[3:26:09] <lessthanhuman_tv> @breakersaweigh interesting ideas executed awfully. cool sequences but not enough gameplay. weird pacing.
[3:26:10] <MayShip> probably should've killed Joel in the middle of the game tbh
[3:26:11] <%possumwalsh1221> ‚ÄúWhen I get to play it‚Äù
[3:26:11] <dante07061947> 70% of ND employees left after U4
[3:26:13] <%amiavamp> when do we get to Fallout 4 weapon crafting?
[3:26:14] <+SolidusRex> I hope Pat streams a whole playthrough so people don't have to buy this
[3:26:15] <Vashido22> the REVENGE gun
[3:26:15] <Phoenon> The Goeln
[3:26:15] <BoborRUU> it looks easier
[3:26:17] <%sjcodan> NOT JOEL GUN
[3:26:17] <RamenRiderZ> This game would be cooler if it took place in Chernobyl
[3:26:21] <Tucker0603> you were on the Joel gun
[3:26:22] <+Shubreaker> what did uncharted 4 win
[3:26:23] <%joshua_42> How much we betting Dina is gonna die?
[3:26:23] <AxelCezar> hryB hryB
[3:26:25] <%boomstickery> even them kidnapping joel would ahve been better
[3:26:27] <%dinnydanny777> I still find the idea that this is what America would be like after just twenty years ridiculous
[3:26:27] <%worldbrand> is it the dark souls of schindler's list?
[3:26:28] <+dmtjinni> LUL LUL LUL
[3:26:30] <olaksi> That quote is some David Cage shit
[3:26:31] <+I_of_the_Storm> Feels like they‚Äôre just trying too hard to get you to like the characters instead of you actually getting to like them
[3:26:31] <ChoculaUltra> but Neil said we weren't allowed to joke about something so "serious" :(
[3:26:32] <%Plasmasnake3> so just replay the first game
[3:26:32] <%doc_ock_rokc> Its literally john wick
[3:26:33] <BreakersAweigh> what the heck its like 3 hours into the stream and there's been no zombies yet????
[3:26:34] <VERDAXY> wait a minute is she going to kill the pregnant lady??
[3:26:34] <collind99> break the window pat
[3:26:34] <%toastybites> it's unintentionally the tropic thunder of narratives
[3:26:35] <+SnapIntoaTimJim> Its trash that assassinates its characters
[3:26:36] <%dinnydanny777> This is just twenty years in the future?
[3:26:37] <%bread_assassin> Huh, I'm the complete opposite. To me, the gameplay is just an obstacle between story beats which is the real meat and potatoes.
[3:26:38] <akosinoogie> more like shitlord's list
[3:26:38] <VoidBeam> NOW WAIT A MINUTE PAT NOOOO PAT NOOOOOO
[3:26:39] <%derap41> Isn't that just the worst feeling when everything but the writing and narrative improves like ME3
[3:26:39] <%emperordread> Berserk has a more compelling tale of revenge than this
[3:26:42] <%Onmi_Khaos> No it's not John Wick was compelling
[3:26:42] <Rabbi_Hyman_Krustofsky> How did this game become this bad thing?
[3:26:45] <VritraReiRei> @patstaresat is this a quick look or a full playthrough?
[3:26:47] <+Psitterrific> Its not even the kill bill of narratives
[3:26:48] <%dashmatt> puzzel
[3:26:49] <%HaikUnagi> 0451
[3:26:49] <+ratreborn> Uncharted 4 at least had gameplay
[3:26:49] <Nelsukako> but Nails say it was. Are you telling that he lied ? :o
[3:26:51] <%czeekyplays> I appreciate characters finally saying "fuck it" and just breaking glass windows to get into a room
[3:26:52] <Meekest> She just did that with her hand
[3:26:52] <%MSN04_Sazabi> People who think our little golfing session was the worst part of the game's story need to strap the fuck in LUL
[3:26:54] <+joshuasxm> this is peak gaming
[3:26:55] <%myriad_truth> Well Berserk is a masterpiece
[3:26:58] <+biodomewithpaulyshor> Why would a military base use glass that can be broken by a 19 year old girl with a knife?
[3:26:59] <%JenovasPuppet> THUNDERDOME
[3:26:59] <%LiquidDinosaur> this is the shindlers list of narratives in that this game is an atrocity
[3:27:00] <cDoom64hunter> It's the schindler's list of narratives because Dina's jewish, and the synagoge scene is coming up
[3:27:00] <@SoFarFetched> @VritraReiRei It depends how he feels at the end of the stream if he plans to stream it more or not.
[3:27:02] <Vashido22> @PatStaresAt how long has it been since the apocalipse now?
[3:27:02] <Blackscience91> I feel like people have been inoculated against whatever this game tries to make you feel.
[3:27:02] <SomeAsianDood> @Rabbi_Hyman_Krustofsky neil Druckmann and his incredible writing skills LUL
[3:27:05] <%dinnydanny777> Like why does everyone in this game choose to be a dickhead
[3:27:07] <yourliteraldog> Schindlers List of Games should be the back of box qoute
[3:27:11] <+artyom47> wait i thought we were trying to stay quiet
[3:27:12] <+OwlLightningMage> I think we're all forgetting about the dog murder LUL
[3:27:15] <$Sphincter_Spelunker> 25
[3:27:15] <natebud> She just said that
[3:27:17] <+Freeborg23> Schindler's List is a pretty depressing film. Can't believe I managed to get through it.
[3:27:17] <%Promessa_EX> yeah you aren't meant to sympathize with the russian mob in john wick
[3:27:18] <aurochdragon> Why lock the door if you can just smash the window?
[3:27:19] <+Insuffrivity> 24-25
[3:27:19] <%derap41> @JenovasPuppet Oh can't you just get Beyond ThunderDome
[3:27:19] <Torgue_1> 50
[3:27:20] <BoborRUU> the gameplay is pretty fun on the hardest difficulty i the previous game, it can get pretty intense
[3:27:22] <%dinnydanny777> Like I guarantee everyone we meet will want to either eat or kill us
[3:27:23] <PrettyThickandStrongDyck> 24 years pat
[3:27:23] <%segonian> I'll just play The Last of Us on if I want to play this game play Loop
[3:27:23] <%OmniSTylez> ??
[3:27:24] <coracor> rature
[3:27:25] <%GarbageQueenEllie> The adventures of Trash continues
[3:27:26] <%consistentlylistless> since the adpocalypse
[3:27:26] <+SpookyCookieMonster> ???
[3:27:26] <%SvenHolgersson> Enough for what
[3:27:27] <Phoenon> Yeah everything looks WAY more nature taking over than the first
[3:27:27] <+SinOmenRoll> deep
[3:27:28] <+SaltyGhostRock> NATURE IUS HEALING
[3:27:28] <%Valdorick> NOT THAT'S THE ZOMBIES
[3:27:28] <%possumwalsh1221> It sure is something
[3:27:30] <+pkmamsters> enough for what??>?
[3:27:30] <mach01_> zombies are killing moose, nature is healing
[3:27:30] <%hzealot> i missed the very start does the game begin with a dog dying?

[3:34:06] <+Thanatoast250> I wouldn't put it past this game to just chop the horse in half
[3:34:07] <jowi_time> how did people not hear that from miles awaay?
[3:34:07] <%Piemen99> They wouldnt do that
[3:34:08] <mach01_> SHIMMER IS BACK LETS GO

[3:34:08] <+FNTR> how we doin in here
[3:34:08] <SolGainer> HORSE MURDER
[3:34:08] <figleafplays> legit thought that was gonna kill the horse
[3:34:09] <theMeNiNBlack6> that would have beent not FUN
[3:34:10] <Nondorian> @PatStaresAt Imagine if that was how Joel died
[3:34:10] <%dinnydanny777> Horse Final Destination
[3:34:11] <bearking05> it nearly killed the best thing in the game
[3:34:11] <%possumwalsh1221> I did too lmao
[3:34:12] <%spiritofmojave> If they did that I'd never forgive this game
[3:34:12] <gabagoosh> titanfall 2 is so good, girl
[3:34:13] <%PanicSwytch> Foreshadowing horses death
[3:34:13] <%MidnightBurst12> god save that horse
[3:34:13] <Gruhunchously> I thought the horse was going to get chopped in fuggin' half.
[3:34:13] <%Livelinne> Oh BibleThump
[3:34:14] <%ragingbrachy> that horse is a ticking time bomb
[3:34:14] <Ids560> and none of the other gate opening was?
[3:34:15] <am_omega> I fucking thought the same thing.
[3:34:16] <%chiazamformerlymankeyfigh> SO MUCH NOISE
[3:34:17] <%NeoCre> @natebud no
[3:34:17] <%Onmi_Khaos> Oh man I thought that too it would have been so in tone for this game
[3:34:18] <%JenovasPuppet> Abby will kill Ellie's horse before the game is over.
[3:34:21] <%Stevennapalm> a wilf
[3:34:21] <%Aeoneth> it lookeed like it

[3:34:27] <Kraigerex1> WLF?
[3:34:28] <%dashmatt> the would have been convenient because the horse if gonna be useless eventually
[3:34:28] <%Onmi_Khaos> And then you'd have to use a bullet to put it out of its misery
[3:34:29] <rissaleigh14> If that horse died I would riot
[3:34:30] <bigcitrus7> amazing gameplay
[3:34:30] <%CursedNobleman> good sound design
[3:34:30] <coracor> TORTURE GOOD
[3:34:31] <%dinnydanny777> This is actually Horse Final Destination
[3:34:33] <@SoFarFetched> That would have been hilarious if it was possible for ellie and dina to get clotheslined by that cable while on the horse LUL
[3:34:33] <Meekest> That note could literally be 10 years old
[3:34:34] <dragonheart45> ya the horse isn't dead

[3:34:37] <$lotharrio> Why is this game about Ellie at all?
[3:34:38] <%ZizerX> Ellie's horse will kill Abby
[3:34:38] <%vicar_anat> IT RHYMES
[3:34:39] <%EuropanLamprey> It worked didn't it?
[3:34:39] <+unintendo> I think the horse is gonna be OKAY from here on.

[3:35:08] <%Dragovus> @PatStaresAt Does Ellie even know Abby's name, cause if not she has less to go on than Abby did when hunting Joel
[3:35:08] <%hax_metatron> This is the hallway-iest gameplay I've ever seen. You spend all your dev time on this, and put gameplay on rails? WTF LUL
[3:35:09] <catwithsunglasses> nostalgia, aren't you feeling it?
[3:35:09] <laguerrilha> She is going to kill dozens of innocent people to get a dozen guys?
[3:35:13] <%LiquidDinosaur> @SargentToughie well she already got the right joel so her terminator mission is over
[3:35:13] <+FortunesBlack> to be fair it worked
[3:35:14] <%apolitenoob> THE CYCLE
[3:35:15] <RamenRiderZ> DONT SAY S-SWEARS
[3:35:15] <+TawnyMonarch> Wonder if you replay and dont pick up the note cause you just remember the code if she still mentions the base from the note
[3:35:16] <%hzealot> @PatStaresAt dont know if you saw one of the check codes is the deus ex code 0451
[3:35:17] <akosinoogie> IM BIG BOSS, AND SO ARE YOU

[3:35:31] <%Shady_Squid> Why do they sound so bored? I never thought i'd miss "GEESUUUS JOEL!"
[3:35:33] <%ProvingVirus> god this is so fuckin boring
[3:35:36] <am_omega> So wiat
[3:35:39] <$Sphincter_Spelunker> @3Xgilly Joel died 2 hours in, and now we're here
[3:35:39] <%Pyroclase> how dystopian
[3:35:42] <+ratreborn> wasnt this plot point about the Cycle of Revenge already done multiple times and better?
[3:35:43] <+DZiffer> more like the cycle of the same dumb plot lines
[3:35:45] <%toastybites> so they're doing an even worst job than joels town
[3:35:46] <FunkyTK> WLF is a pain to say, just go with WoLF
[3:35:49] <OneThousandTomatoes> @lotharrio good point

[3:36:18] <%Valdorick> EMOTIONS
[3:36:19] <%ragingbrachy> innovation
[3:36:19] <+EmptyMug> Oh no Horsey 3000 is no longer mountable
[3:36:19] <Blighthelm> HORSE IS DEAD NEW FRIEND IS HORRIBLE JUMP
[3:36:19] <zenith0111> HOLD FORWARD. NO EXPLORING
[3:36:19] <+Klonoa__> baffling
[3:36:20] <xbb1024> She is white, Pat
[3:36:21] <+krymzen5> its sooo lame
[3:36:23] <%possumwalsh1221> Omg the jump
[3:36:24] <SomeAsianDood> wow.... that looks..... not good
[3:36:24] <RunningNGunning> Because the animation team was bored
[3:36:25] <+gutsmcbutts> ask the old GTAs
[3:36:25] <Excelumin> No longer allowed to play horsie. Ellie has GROWN UP, this game is MATURE and GOOD.
[3:36:26] <%GohanHitsugaya> Yep
[3:36:27] <mach01_> look at that white woman jump
[3:36:28] <%sniffy77> for immersion paaaaat
[3:36:28] <Nuclearcherries> That's barely a jump
[3:36:28] <natebud> who cares?
[3:36:29] <%doc_ock_rokc> because they can
[3:36:29] <%JenovasPuppet> Jumping is realistic!
[3:36:29] <starkandstag> f no fun
[3:36:29] <%myriad_truth> Uncharted BS
[3:36:29] <$daveronald> so people can photoshop a scateboard in
[3:36:29] <%reinbachthe3rd> So bad.
[3:36:30] <Rabbi_Hyman_Krustofsky> HAS ANY GAME PROGRAMMER EVER SEEN A PERSON BACK UP BEFORE? FUCK, IT ALWAYS LOOKS SO UNNATURAL
[3:36:30] <%Rafferty3231> 30 minutes of gameplay has put this one firmly in the NO column because it's boring as FUCK. But Pat & Paige are cool, so I'll keep watching anyway
[3:36:30] <+Blokehat> I like games having a jump regardless tbh
[3:36:30] <%HaikUnagi> She can't jump for shit
[3:36:30] <+spottedwolf10> The walk backwards looks so bad NotLikeThis
[3:36:30] <raven_frame> Poor Pat, putting himself through this for us.
[3:36:30] <T_Sasquatch> ITS INNOVATE PAT
[3:36:31] <gabagoosh> bear grylls needs to teach her how to jump
[3:36:32] <%GarbageQueenEllie> This makes me look lamer than usual
[3:36:32] <%ceriani1234> IT BROKE NEW GROUNDS
[3:36:32] <Phoenon> So you can look dumb on purpose
[3:36:32] <BluBox> A whopping 1 inch of the ground
[3:36:32] <dante07061947> because revenge bad guyz
[3:36:32] <brachydios777> Why though?
[3:36:33] <Sunstalker> Because it's ripped from Uncharted 4
[3:36:34] <%D00msDayDan> so much crunch went into that jump
[3:36:34] <KokujinDo> to make you feel like it was an addition
[3:36:34] <am_omega> Wait so the WLF did the whole "Fuck FEDRA" and actively ruined other people's lives.
[3:36:34] <lagandcrash> cause its funny
[3:36:34] <RubberFistFight> @PatStaresAt SkillUp said the exact same thing.
[3:36:34] <Gruhunchously> Look at her legs go.
[3:36:35] <%Ranryu692> because if it made sense, it would be fun
[3:36:35] <%spiritofmojave> why even have that small leap that takes more time then just running
[3:36:35] <%Arek_1> LUL
[3:36:36] <%possumwalsh1221> INNOVATION
[3:36:37] <to_tyne> Hello .O.
[3:36:38] <artoflec> this game seems so dated
[3:36:38] <%squintypete226> QWOP
[3:36:39] <studleydoorite> why doesn't she do flips when she jumps like in Majora's Mask
[3:36:40] <+Kataiser> Jumping is an advertisable ability, clearly.
[3:36:40] <%YakumoYomi> SHUT UP THERE'S NO TIME
[3:36:40] <+Insuffrivity> Love that the horse follows you around
[3:36:40] <The_Dark_Gods> obligatory feature from prior games having it and them just going along with tradition
[3:36:43] <AxelCezar> that is a horrible jump animation
[3:36:43] <theMeNiNBlack6> LUL
[3:36:44] <OneThousandTomatoes> At least it makes sense for GTA
[3:36:44] <+Chewygamer> You don't like that animation? Looks great AAA 10/10 -IGN
[3:36:45] <%sjcodan> 6969
[3:36:45] <+DiabloDeAzul> Because dummying out Uncharted features from the engine is HARD, pat
[3:36:46] <SolGainer> Because they figured incorrectly that people wouldn't mash it
[3:36:46] <jobbedbone> PLAYERS LIKE JUMP BUTTON, EVEN IF ITS USELESS
[3:36:46] <+Donutjulio> That jump had to be last minute
[3:36:46] <PineappleBison> Prance button
[3:36:47] <+OmegaOcelotOk> pat you should jump and show us how its done
[3:36:47] <+SnapIntoaTimJim> @natebud Its wasted animation which means wasted money.
[3:36:48] <BobCarlosJunior> You can definitely jump higher in real life what the fuck
[3:36:49] <%LiquidDinosaur> @sjcodan yeah like, we talk a lot about the government and oppression and tyranny and >politics, but like this is literally the fucking apocalypse, I think that lots of heavy handed policies are somewhat justified if humanity is at existential threat of extinction?
[3:36:51] <%derap41> Because pat people complained about not being able to jump in the first game
[3:36:51] <BurdRightsActivist> LAST OF US 2 INVENTED SCHINDLER'S LIST AND JUMPING, MARIO IS A RIPOFF
[3:36:51] <Ki_Memento> seems like a step backwards from 1
[3:36:51] <+krymzen5> this is why womens nba will never be big Kappa
[3:36:52] <3Xgilly> the pain in neil's ass sprung him forward
[3:36:52] <%angel949> jump punch?
[3:36:52] <$ShadowZiggy> i think tbf, joel had the same kind of jump I believe
[3:36:53] <+Solutha> Im sorry where are those vines rooted on that truck
[3:36:53] <Cluntch_Diddler> Because they took all the fun out of the game. But they did put in a Jump Button as exchange!
[3:36:53] <benjiFG> we
[3:36:53] <RamenRiderZ> You need to level up your Acrobatics
[3:36:54] <%Onmi_Khaos> So pat, I'd say around this time, Death Stranding had you hooked in, would that be fair?
[3:36:55] <bimjojo> maybe its some half-baked satire? it IS a REALLY over-the-top Mario jump
[3:36:55] <%chambatron> 5345
[3:36:56] <%julrave> 5345
[3:36:56] <+FNTR> the kids LOVE jump buttons.
[3:36:57] <laguerrilha> 5345
[3:36:57] <%reinbachthe3rd> 5345
[3:36:59] <Lutre> it's the music industry code
[3:36:59] <%CommanderSqueaks> Ugh READING says Pat
[3:36:59] <%PNPLost_1> 5345
[3:37:01] <dukenux> heyyy, there's 0451
[3:37:02] <+beardy_foxbear> 5345
[3:37:02] <dasfauka> white people cant jump, that is the most accurate part of this game
[3:37:03] <The_Forgotten_Alligator> is that even a jump
[3:37:03] <zenith0111> @insuffrivity AIs have done that since atari dude
[3:37:05] <%dinnydanny777> It's just an Uncharted jump too
[3:37:06] <natebud> @SnapIntoaTimJim It's just the standard jump animation.
[3:37:06] <%Xevtes> 5345
[3:37:06] <ReiDuran> 0451
[3:37:07] <+Neoepochx> @PatStaresAt Don't you know? This is the first of its kind for jumping in a video game. Massive innovation. They aren't going to get it right the first time!
[3:37:08] <%bigboy3d> It's weird, jumping in Uncharted 4 felt great
[3:37:09] <figleafplays> hey look its the EXACT CODES WE NEED
[3:37:11] <+nathandiel> So boring. Let‚Äôs play anything else
[3:37:11] <coracor> look at the gate
[3:37:12] <%julrave> EAST 2 is on the gate
[3:37:12] <%chambatron> EAST 2
[3:37:12] <%hzealot> @PatStaresAt look above the gate

[3:40:00] <RubberFistFight> This is padding, btw. Multiple non-shill reviews have pointed out that the game could shave 10hrs off its playtime if it got rid of pointless roaming sections that aren't actually open world and don't actually contribute to the story at all.

[3:41:29] <RubberFistFight> @TheVeebieJeebies in short, the leaks were 100% accurate, Druckmann is a hack, and Troy Baker is a goddamn liar.
[3:41:30] <+DZiffer> mogu mogu
[3:41:30] <$lotharrio> Stealth.
[3:41:30] <SolGainer> nice

[3:41:32] <%BinaryFireball> big eats
[3:41:32] <Huntercd> Did they fuck or just make out ?
[3:41:32] <+NotSoAccurateNo1> this game would legitimately be way better if they deleted all the banter dialogue
[3:41:33] <%wrightlight94> Death 2
[3:41:33] <catwithsunglasses> Pat not good at stealth
[3:41:33] <%GarbageQueenEllie> I thought these games were about sneaking around and being quiet?
[3:41:34] <+Psitterrific> This game has all the energy of my clinical depression at the moment
[3:41:34] <Cluntch_Diddler> Well at least the gameplay looks "fun" LUL
[3:41:35] <%Pyroclase> this doesn't look very fun, honestly
[3:41:35] <yourliteraldog> there like 4
[3:41:36] <natebud> Game overs are a failure of the game designer
[3:41:36] <%possumwalsh1221> Jesus Joel again
[3:41:36] <KokujinDo> why is it a one and done?
[3:41:36] <katocrimson> time for bottle and brick
[3:41:36] <%Rafferty3231> YAY SHE'S DEAD AGAIN
[3:41:37] <%beansoup> the sound design is good i'll give them that.

[3:41:37] <Copious_Koopies> shoot gun. gun good
[3:41:37] <%squintypete226> Are those Assassins Creed easy kills?!?
[3:41:37] <SGrim> What if Tommy?
[3:41:38] <%DesertPenguin> EA PLAY is showing off Star Wars: Squadrons
[3:41:39] <%questionablemat> at this point wouldnt you as a group of humans systematically kill off all the zombies in a area?
[3:41:39] <jorniev> REMEMBER THE BOTTLE AND BRIVK PAT
[3:41:39] <figleafplays> god fuck the clickers they are such bullshit
[3:41:40] <%chiazamformerlymankeyfigh> This area is TOO HIGH LEVEL HUH
[3:41:40] <mar_krow> Loud gun shots
[3:41:41] <%Onmi_Khaos> Seriously how are there still Stage 1's
[3:41:42] <+SaltyGhostRock> @Pappajimbo crossbows are actually pretty loud
[3:41:42] <DE777ON> flashlight FFS
[3:41:42] <laguerrilha> Sneak 100
[3:41:44] <RamenRiderZ> EAR MY SOURCE OF POWER
[3:41:44] <davey0000> are mind goblins stopping all ammo usage
[3:41:44] <%LegendGHT> i mean to be fair nothing's happened for ages
[3:41:45] <+Orkytechpriest> sounds like the lady falling out of the grape squisher
[3:41:46] <Rigid_Iguana> are you scared by this survival horror game
[3:41:47] <%Onmi_Khaos> NEXT TO STAGE 3's!
[3:41:47] <+Armeggadon> remember how you were complaining earlier about how the individual clickers weren't a threat lol
[3:41:48] <Amardeux> lights off for runners
[3:41:49] <gabagoosh> this game would be better with more gameplay
[3:41:49] <$RealThiele> revenge!
[3:41:51] <+unintendo> Less painful than the dialogue
[3:41:52] <%ragingbrachy> monkaS
[3:41:52] <%dashmatt> flashlights on
[3:41:52] <%LegendGHT> !uptime
[3:41:52] <omen_setter> one of my favorite touches from TLOU1 was that dialogue never repeated if you had to restart a section
[3:41:53] <@Moobot> I've been playing this game for how long? Oh only 3h 42m.
[3:41:54] <Gruhunchously> THEY SAW THE FLASHLIGHT
[3:41:56] <sagebumblebee665> How far is pat so far
[3:41:56] <+fetrigon> WHO WOULD'VE THOUGHT THERE'D BE MORE THAN ONE LUL
[3:41:56] <Daebunz> this gameplay caused me to fall off the first game HARD
[3:41:58] <sooptime420> this is evoking "dark souls" as sessler would say
[3:42:01] <%bevyrage> that was the twelfth frozen corpse woman model you've killed in the game btw
[3:42:02] <zenith0111> @valdorick Fungi highjacks the body but the bodies dead well... it's dead lol
[3:42:03] <+SolidusRex> You can't expect Pat to be on point after being numbed by the "gameplay" for the last hour
[3:42:04] <anymouse233> Freaking Ganados, man
[3:42:05] <%Livelinne> cocktailÔºü
[3:42:06] <%dashmatt> bs
[3:42:06] <+Thanatoast250> Don't forget about your distraction items, Patt
[3:42:07] <%CommanderSqueaks> flashlight
[3:42:09] <%spiritofmojave> you sure?
[3:42:10] <%ragingbrachy> they might though
[3:42:11] <Wolveus> The Runners do.
[3:42:12] <+OmegaOcelotOk> the runners do
[3:42:12] <$Sphincter_Spelunker> I'm no good with stealth games
[3:42:12] <RubberFistFight> @Cluntch_Diddler it is literally 1:1 the same combat/gameplay loop from the first game. No refinement, no innovation, no nothing. Just slightly better animations.
[3:42:13] <mar_krow> Use a brick
[3:42:13] <OpenMikeLive> but why not
[3:42:14] <%czeekyplays> Whoever said Tommy would make a much more enjoyable companion is super right. Imagine him telling compelling stories of Joel to Ellie
[3:42:15] <DE777ON> there are non clickers there
[3:42:15] <%xxshadowxx416> new star wars game look good
[3:42:15] <%asaoirc> THE RUNNERS DO, PAT
[3:42:16] <%GarbageQueenEllie> So is Dina the new hot garbage?
[3:42:17] <%restingbones> They did in the first game
[3:42:17] <Shwepie> They hear the light.
[3:42:18] <Animorphimagi> ?
[3:42:18] <%myriad_truth> That was established in the first game
[3:42:18] <lagandcrash> perhaps
[3:42:18] <$vincerocmm> they see nothing
[3:42:19] <korth367> I MISS JOEL AND KID GARBAGE
[3:42:19] <Amardeux> the runners see them
[3:42:20] <%HibikiYamada> The runners don't see the flashlight lol
[3:42:22] <Andrizzleton> They don't see PERIOD
[3:42:23] <%derap41> Combat in this game was a lot more like a puzzle at higher difficulties
[3:42:24] <%CommanderSqueaks> RUNNERS SEE IT
[3:42:25] <Ki_Memento> only humans see flashlights
[3:42:25] <Frostydough1> clicekrs dont runners do it's literalllyin the first game wwtf pat
[3:42:26] <Alexisonfires> PAT TELL PAGIE TO STOP MAKING THOSE NOISES
[3:42:26] <%myriad_truth> Runners don't see it either
[3:42:26] <+KilogramHours> RUNNERS DO
[3:42:29] <%dashmatt> but they see it
[3:42:29] <%king_wragles> The blind enemies can't see light? Oh man, who'da thunk it?
[3:42:29] <+BeezusHrist> STAR WARS SQUADRON LAUNCHING 10.2 @PatStaresAt

[3:42:36] <+DZiffer> Pat the others still have eyes
[3:42:37] <Kraigerex1> Now that is a "Stealth Kill"
[3:42:37] <FunkyTK> here comes the clicker
[3:42:40] <inshanemane> OH MY GOOOOOOOOD
[3:42:40] <+SolidusRex> Clickers are blind, like Toph
[3:42:41] <$adimcorner> you should feel guilty for having a Flash Light
[3:42:43] <+rottingpastry> What happened to Runners first?
[3:42:44] <%sniffy77> can Dina die?
[3:42:44] <%JenovasPuppet> Dina you got this, 2 v 1
[3:42:44] <%heartlesshealer> F

[3:42:54] <%heartlesshealer> M I S E R Y

[3:43:42] <%FluffiTamamo> @sniffy77 Immortal, but still vulnerable to grabs. So yes, a bit of babysitting.
[3:43:43] <BioApple> why do they call it a stealth kill if it alerts nearby enemies
[3:43:44] <%flechet> 100/10
[3:43:44] <%amiavamp> Truly this is the Dark Souls of video games
[3:43:46] <%JenovasPuppet> "Fuck me" "Not now Ellie, we're under attack!"

[3:44:01] <snipsnoopyouvebeendooped> if the game alerts the enemies with a stealth kill, why even have it
[3:44:02] <%CursedNobleman> naaaaailed it
[3:44:03] <FunkyTK> That zombie sounded strangely normal
[3:44:04] <natebud> Who knew guns were so effective?
[3:44:05] <%CommanderSqueaks> HE FINALLY USED GUN
[3:44:05] <%Kaji04> Practical problem
[3:44:06] <%Dfreddy8> FIRST TRY
[3:44:07] <guppy_> do you need to destroy their face armor first??

[3:44:14] <%wrightlight94> Nice first try
[3:44:14] <%Ranryu692> so getting the top of its head blown off wasn't fatal, but a stab to the neck was?
[3:44:15] <%dinnydanny777> What
[3:44:15] <%derap41> So now zombies are scary again
[3:44:16] <%Pyroclase> Maybe they're WLF???
[3:44:16] <+OmegaOcelotOk> That took you to long for an easy fight
[3:44:17] <%asaoirc> I think the strike only one hit kills from stealth I think
[3:44:18] <%possumwalsh1221> The clicker flails like Lisa going ‚ÄúI‚Äôm just gonna swing my arms and if you get hit it‚Äôs your fault‚Äù
[3:44:18] <%questionablemat> man stealth don't mean shit here

[3:44:39] <%Das_Bass> no fun
[3:44:39] <Cluntch_Diddler> @RubberFistFight yeah. the first one wasnt much fun either. But story and characters were great! But here it seems to be boring parts broken by bad gameplay.

[3:44:50] <%Pyroclase> There's no urgency whatsoever to this story, it's bizzare
[3:44:50] <ChaddeusMaximus> @PatStaresAt dude EA just revealed FIFA 2021 GET HYPE
[3:44:51] <+Saltima> this dialogue makes me want to do ANYTHING else
[3:44:51] <%spiritofmojave> Guess the 'no fun' was a delayed effrct
[3:44:52] <%possumwalsh1221> The last of fun
[3:44:52] <%wrightlight94> I rather see u play the first one
[3:44:52] <%M3djedx> LUL LUL LUL

[3:44:56] <mar_krow> Not fun
[3:44:56] <LtSolo> JUST WATCH THE MOVIE ON YOUTUBE
[3:44:57] <%Daxalog> Lets youtube the cutscenes and call it a day!
[3:44:58] <Gruhunchously> A game like this lives and dies by it's story and interactions. This game has been lacking in both department so far.
[3:44:58] <Run44forrest> @snipsnoopyouvebeendooped i think one of the normal zombies saw it is all
[3:44:59] <+Neoepochx> @patstaresat WE DON'T USE THE WORD FUN PAT
[3:44:59] <BurdRightsActivist> FUN isn't a game you should use to describe this. There wasn't any FUN in Schindler's List
[3:45:01] <Nelsukako> well, at least bang bang and stabby stabby it is still kinda fun it seems
[3:45:02] <%invisi_bliss> invisi_bliss subscribed at Tier 1. They've subscribed for 8 months! 
[3:45:02] <%Purple_badger3000> The God of War remake was more interesting than this and that was slow as shit
[3:45:03] <+SolidusRex> The Last of Fun
[3:45:03] <%medusasghost> its cause the end goal doesn't matter to any of us
[3:45:03] <+SaltySombrero> play Ultrakill to KILL BOREDOM
[3:45:03] <T_Sasquatch> ive constantly said that last of us has shit gameplay and its only the story people care about
[3:45:04] <shotgang86> maaaaaybe gets good later
[3:45:04] <+xmetalicdemonx> I am going to assume we are all fine with this being a one off.
[3:45:04] <%sjcodan> PACE ANNIHILATION
[3:45:05] <bearking05> i would rather play as the horse
[3:45:05] <+vampireinarm> play Dead by Daylight instead
[3:45:05] <+Taglog7> They blew the Joal load to soon
[3:45:05] <%ragingbrachy> now ill never know what happens FeelsBadMan
[3:45:05] <%KnivesEve> switch to destiny
[3:45:05] <JoviLovesYou> Yeah Pat thats the point. You're not supposed to enjoy the game you're playing. Thats silly.
[3:45:05] <+krymzen5> its so milktoast
[3:45:06] <Tonicky > Remember fun?
[3:45:06] <+AXL808> very anti-room
[3:45:06] <+Auriel_Astrum> I
[3:45:06] <%ElkRiverDog> Why would they know what a bank looks like?
[3:45:07] <%flechet> its not bad design its a feature
[3:45:08] <+Mouse_Fitzgerald> an empty explorable area
[3:45:08] <NoirePanzer> Are you having FUN‚Ñ¢ ?
[3:45:08] <pennykettle_> I feel like this setting is just way too late. I dont want to explore zombie city
[3:45:09] <%derap41> Welcome to AAA mediocrity its not bad just bland and boring
[3:45:10] <The_Forgotten_Alligator> dud wtf man, david cage shits is more entertaining
[3:45:11] <WaifusSansFrontieres> stream P5Dancing
[3:45:11] <%Onmi_Khaos> I miss Death Stranding
[3:45:12] <Cluntch_Diddler> @RunningNGunning Its CHOP now LUL
[3:45:12] <+Sochin_Iitsu> why wasn't the first one boring? was it because Joel and Ellie hated each other?
[3:45:12] <VERDAXY> POWER THROUGH
[3:45:13] <KokujinDo> seems kinda dull for an area
[3:45:14] <+MrWrann> But you can't explore it
[3:45:14] <%ABigPinkLion> WAKE ME UP
[3:45:16] <%UvBenServed> Explorable areas don't matter if there's NOTHING there
[3:45:18] <%honeyman18> Is there currency at their home base?
[3:45:18] <ExpressNode> This is just like the first in this regard
[3:45:18] <ireliaismaiwaifu> "We don't use the word FUN"
[3:45:19] <%sjcodan> WAKE ME UP INSIDE
[3:45:19] <zenith0111> POINTLESS ROOM WOOOOOOOT
[3:45:19] <%heartlesshealer> One of the bodies dropped a craft material
[3:45:20] <laguerrilha> The first game had little dialogue too, but it was so good it was enough. this...
[3:45:21] <%de1ete_forever> can we actually just play Dusk tho
[3:45:22] <Meekest> Sony said you'd be a great fit for this game
[3:45:24] <%Mr_Pylon> Stop this stream and start Obra Dinn early
[3:45:24] <omen_setter> the voice direction is lowkey pissing me off. everyone talks in a bored whisper
[3:45:24] <+Hawk_Z7_69> how are things going? i fell asleep a little bit
[3:45:25] <@ShockzNDrawe> SO real question: What's the actual GOAL rn? I don't mean the revenge quest, I mean what if their actual objective currently
[3:45:26] <RubberFistFight> @PatStaresAt it's "explorable" but it's not open and it contributes nothing to the story. No sidequests, no anything. The gameplay is still rigidly linear.
[3:45:26] <%LegendGHT> Can't Wake Up
[3:45:27] <TheMadBadger> It's far too big and takes too long to get through, as far this shows us
[3:45:29] <%cvp5127> WHY
[3:45:30] <%Starotter70> Did I miss anything Chat?
[3:45:32] <snipsnoopyouvebeendooped> @Run44forrest ohhh that makes more sense. Thanks!

[3:46:34] <%czeekyplays> This isn't a game, it's a "narrative experience"

[3:48:07] <%GohanHitsugaya> Should be nothing but spores right now
[3:48:07] <+masked_hero_lucky> Yeah, don't the really old ones turn into crazy monsters?
[3:48:07] <+michingmallecho> No wonder they‚Äôre weak

[3:48:21] <$iaraCatunda> can't wait for a rant about this game in a podcast
[3:48:21] <$Sphincter_Spelunker> hey, that was fun. shooting that brains out
[3:48:22] <%asaoirc> okay that's a good shotgun though
[3:48:22] <%Onmi_Khaos> STILL STAGE 1 too!
[3:48:22] <+AXL808> couldn't they be more recently infected?
[3:48:23] <KeystoneA2> the robber dudes in armor should be bloaters
[3:48:24] <%bevyrage> psaBlind
[3:48:25] <karl_rex> THIS BANTER IS SO DRY
[3:48:25] <SomeAsianDood> oh that's juicy
[3:48:25] <Gruhunchously> If they were infected for that long they would have become Bloaters, right?
[3:48:25] <%myriad_truth> I mean, technically they would be bloaters if they were
[3:48:26] <zenith0111> @de777on Zombies have never seen the flashlight sine LOU1
[3:48:27] <+thepotatosorceress> that shotgun would be rusted to shit and would NOT cycle at all
[3:48:27] <%chiazamformerlymankeyfigh> IN ONE HUH?
[3:48:29] <%Dementedpenguin> Riveting.
[3:48:30] <+Chewygamer> at least the combat is pretty satisfying. shooting that guy in the face felt pretty good
[3:48:31] <Run44forrest> @patstaresat hey pat remember when you praised tlou 1 for having that one room with nothing in it
[3:48:31] <$vincerocmm> was there even gas
[3:48:31] <Andrizzleton> >2020 not even 60 fps
[3:48:32] <Meekest> You came in here for one note
[3:48:33] <%Mekhet09> Why couldn't ellie's VA sound older?
[3:48:36] <%danielm427> no shut up pat, play videogame dont ask questions
[3:48:36] <+Neoepochx> Wait...is this a side quest?
[3:48:36] <jorniev> TERRIBLE BANTER
[3:48:37] <PrettyThickandStrongDyck> They should be either bloaters or fungus spores
[3:48:37] <%ceriani1234> don't eject the shell or anything ellie
[3:48:37] <%Ganerumo> @PatStaresAt I think the game lets you increase ammo drops and all in difficulty honestly just go for it who cares
[3:48:38] <%Onmi_Khaos> "Hey remember that bit in Resident Evil 4 where you get a shotgun and then immediately get attacked?"
[3:48:38] <%Promessa_EX> that's enough ganmeplayh
[3:48:38] <%chambatron> Wasn't elli like 8 on the first one and now she's 20?
[3:48:39] <T_Sasquatch> how are they sustaining themselves
[3:48:40] <Vohs_Bru> This game looks kind of ugly for a PS4 game
[3:48:40] <%M3djedx> Fuck this game is dumb
[3:48:40] <%apolitenoob> That was a good shotgun actually
[3:48:41] <+GADtheBAD> should be more heavily mushroomed ones
[3:48:41] <%linSP> why arent all zombies turned to mush by now omg
[3:48:41] <UnlimitedBick> @GADtheBAD ashley johnson just sounds like that bro don't be a weirdo about it
[3:48:43] <lagandcrash> the zombies are having as much fun as we are
[3:48:44] <omen_setter> is this the first mumblecore game?
[3:48:44] <%ragingbrachy> no
[3:48:44] <Cluntch_Diddler> I thought that old Zombies turn into clickers. And Old clickers turn into those Spore thingys?
[3:48:44] <HanDaimond> Are the infected elves or some shit?
[3:48:45] <+vampireinarm> they also survived all the bombings apperantly
[3:48:46] <BaslerJones> @PatStaresAt can you play League instead ?
[3:48:47] <%myriad_truth> She was 13
[3:48:48] <%JenovasPuppet> Okay, THAT'S the part that makes no sense, why are they not all goo now?
[3:48:49] <+TawnyMonarch> @chambatron she was 14
[3:48:49] <collind99> Half of the things you opened in the OG didn‚Äôt have items in them iirc
[3:48:49] <%StooEsq> riveting dialogue
[3:48:50] <BioApple> the ANTI ROOM
[3:48:51] <%honeyman18> You unlocked one Bulet
[3:48:51] <ThatOneGuyYouSaw> @chambatron she was like 14
[3:48:52] <TheAimless> @AXL808 they wore body armor, the same kind a shotgun skeleton, so.... probably not
[3:48:54] <%shieldecho> actually yes
[3:48:55] <%Roasted_Pheasant> I miss collectibles...
[3:48:56] <%consistentlylistless> I don't know man, I feel like if Neil wanted to make more of an impact on me, a gamer, he should've filled this game with quickscoping montages
[3:48:57] <$iaraCatunda> God... at least death stranding was boring on purpose
[3:48:57] <%amiavamp> It's fallout 4 with too many "realism" mods installed
[3:48:57] <%bluetocho13> couldnt they just set fire to the whole place on fire and call it a day
[3:48:58] <%myriad_truth> Or 14
[3:48:58] <$lotharrio> They keep murdering Ellie... how are they infecting people if they murder them all, every time?
[3:48:58] <%ragingbrachy> WHO CARES
[3:48:59] <%callum3434> was LOU this slow?
[3:48:59] <OpenMikeLive> so literally where did the other zombies come from

[3:50:51] <Gruhunchously> These two have nothing going on other then the fact that they fucked that one time.
[3:50:51] <faldin> Yeah rdr2 was kinda bad
[3:50:51] <+beardy_foxbear> I also hated it
[3:50:52] <Them00n> Can we go back to Dusk?
[3:50:53] <%GarbageQueenEllie> Well no wonder I never finished RD2 then
[3:50:54] <+xendless_xurbia> death stranding got so fucking underrated
[3:50:54] <zenith0111> DID YOU PLAY RDR2????
[3:50:54] <@SoFarFetched> @sjcodan They've been told about it before the stream started. They should it should be fine since Twitch is allowing this game to be streamed. I mean even the witcher games got streamed on twitch.
[3:50:54] <gabagoosh> i like red dead 2 a lot and i really shouldn't. it does so many things I don't typically like, but it just worked for that game.
[3:50:54] <%Pyroclase> how did he die in a tank??
[3:50:55] <TonyPullMyDTRedgrave> i can understand not liking it but how is it at all a QTE?
[3:50:55] <%SirGO0SE> psaWrong psaWrong psaWrong psaWrong
[3:50:55] <rubbishbinge> red dead revolver?
[3:50:56] <+DiabloDeAzul> Is it fair to say that graphics CAN'T sell a game anymore?
[3:50:56] <%Coffee_JD> both red dead games are boring
[3:50:56] <auraofdawn> It was at least entertainingly silly with its logic at times
[3:50:56] <DynzelWashington> Tbf Kojima is legend of nonsense writing
[3:50:56] <%BinaryFireball> Red Dead Revolver is the actual best game
[3:50:57] <%ragingbrachy> you missed a skeleman
[3:50:57] <jorniev> OUTER WILDS IS NOT FAIR TO THIS GAME

[3:50:59] <The_Forgotten_Alligator> still better than this zhit lol

[3:51:00] <%Corporate_Redeemer> BULLY 2 NEVER
[3:51:00] <VJdarkworld> Oof.
[3:51:01] <%blackbaron98> I liked it
[3:51:01] <%Roasted_Pheasant> The first 20 hours of Red Dead are farming
[3:51:01] <%honeyman18> I just liked wandering and picking berries
[3:51:01] <+garbotrasho> oof
[3:51:02] <+SpookyCookieMonster> So no one opened the TANK in 30 years
[3:51:02] <%cervidaequus> OOF
[3:51:02] <Vashido22> oof
[3:51:02] <%de1ete_forever> paige feel bad?
[3:51:03] <+I_of_the_Storm> QTEs feel good to play tho
[3:51:03] <@mothmandraws> thankfully skeleton had bullets on lap
[3:51:04] <%myriad_truth> Eh, I liked Red Dead 2
[3:51:04] <%Nope80808> @PatStaresAt You ever see that video Nakeyjakey did on Red Ded 2?
[3:51:05] <Nelsukako> really ? i am kinda surprise. Why ? i mean, except the part of being a QTE game as you said
[3:51:05] <ThDark> Are there many QTE's in RDR2? That's a weird criticism of it
[3:51:06] <+Toblo1> I like Red Dead 2‚Äôs story at least
[3:51:07] <+Cavumentum> THAT MAN IS A SKELETON
[3:51:07] <+Neoepochx> Bad movement in a game can really make a game feel less fun.
[3:51:07] <%JusTTheGuyYouNeed> RDR 2 should've been a linear game, the story is awesome but the rest is kinda poop
[3:51:08] <Scrub_of_scrubs> Ha, she said oof
[3:51:08] <+MrWrann> How did the tank catch on fire?
[3:51:08] <BrachyZoid> t101Oof
[3:51:08] <xbb1024> This game would be more fun with sky whales
[3:51:08] <%urdumb4twitching> @PatStaresAt that Joel trailer scene was bait and switch, in the game its Jesse
[3:51:08] <%Sendrak70> Hey Pat, can we get more dusk or dbd instead of this.
[3:51:08] <its_menathan> Yeah I enjoyed playing 1 a lot
[3:51:08] <Moonlight_Grimoire> molotoves are nasty
[3:51:08] <%BusterRepukken> @PatStaresAt i dont think RDR2 was bad but the movement was awful.
[3:51:10] <artoflec> yikes, oof
[3:51:11] <%arkv01> what the fuck is with this dialogue
[3:51:12] <%dinnydanny777> No note
[3:51:12] <%ragingbrachy> you dont have to be if theres nothing, you know
[3:51:13] <+YabbaTroll> how tf did the zombies beat a tank?
[3:51:13] <+mrwake96> The game looks really pretty, but none of the map or level design seems all that interesting. A gold hallway is still a hallway.
[3:51:13] <%walternatorz> paige is awfully quiet
[3:51:14] <+Solutha> 2 shells, in a box
[3:51:14] <KokujinDo> ...how did the dude in the tank get messed up?
[3:51:14] <%julrave> it's kinda hard to hear Paige
[3:51:15] <%JenovasPuppet> Cannot hear the Paige
[3:51:15] <RubberFistFight> @PatStaresAt I enjoyed it immensely, but holy SHIT is it fucking slow and Arthur never moves with any sense of urgency, even when he's being fired at. You always need to see every step of the slow "removing the gun from the horse" animation. It's fucking awful.
[3:51:16] <%abakkus> who's talking
[3:51:16] <+SolidusRex> Stop trying Paige
[3:51:16] <%dinnydanny777> No note?
[3:51:16] <+Psitterrific> I had to get a package... anything happen in the last 20 minutes?
[3:51:17] <%heartlesshealer> Paige's mic is off
[3:51:17] <%amiavamp> RDR2 takes too many bad cues from GTA V
[3:51:18] <%SirGO0SE> im 30 hours in and havent seen a SINGLE QTE idk what hes talking about
[3:51:18] <%derap41> I mean its not bad its juts not very good
[3:51:18] <%RyanTheRecluse> I enjoyed red dead 2 for the story and writing, had no attachment to the game play
[3:51:19] <%Onmi_Khaos> as a burnt skeleton? Dina what the fuck was that line
[3:51:19] <lagandcrash> not checking if the dude had a gun in the tank?
[3:51:19] <%sjcodan> @SoFarFetched Ah, cool. Didn't want them to get in any trouble for this flacid game
[3:51:20] <olaksi> How did that guy have a tank and still lose to zombies=
[3:51:20] <gomennasorry> OOF
[3:51:20] <$lotharrio> Hey you know what would be neat? If 25 years after society collapsed, things had actually started being put back together.
[3:51:20] <%czeekyplays> Oh shit Apollo 1
[3:51:21] <%spiritofmojave> Paige you're distant!
[3:51:22] <%floralkami> is Paige talking?
[3:51:23] <%cervidaequus> Paige muted
[3:51:23] <%de1ete_forever> paige fell down a well?
[3:51:24] <ThatOneGuyYouSaw> so how's the game so far?
[3:51:24] <%ragingbrachy> but theres nothing
[3:51:25] <+Insuffrivity> Lol, Pat is not trying
[3:51:25] <SolGainer> It's hard to be positive about AAA Crunch games
[3:51:26] <HanDaimond> Because RDR1 felt less like a simulator
[3:51:27] <%dinnydanny777> He just turned into a skeleton inside the tank without a note
[3:51:27] <%Chaoko99> THAT'S WRONG
[3:51:27] <+Likkada> RD and RD2 are both awful, its just reskined GTA
[3:51:28] <mach01_> The same way any tank catches on fire, someone hit it in the engine or the fuel tank or the ammo with something that went big boom
[3:51:29] <%Onmi_Khaos> It's boring as shit
[3:51:29] <%wrightlight94> I like that paige is trying
[3:51:30] <FunkyTK> I don't get how those guys in the tank died
[3:51:31] <HODGETASTROPHE> I'm pretty sure Abrahms crews cant burn out like that
[3:51:31] <%julrave> Paige can u speak into the microphone please
[3:51:32] <%AncelDeLambert> PAIGE EAT THE MIC
[3:51:32] <laguerrilha> Red Dead 2 had boring gameplay, but the writing was AMAZING
[3:51:32] <gabagoosh> you have a harder time being positive when it's boring as shit.
[3:51:32] <Profmcstevie> But we LOVE shitting on it, we've shat on the game BEFORE it came out
[3:51:32] <prime_name> I feel like this game took all the wrong lessons from God of War 4
[3:51:33] <%ragingbrachy> the game is pretty but thats it
[3:51:33] <TrashLeviathan> is paige in a well ???
[3:51:34] <%Chaoko99> IT WAS A MECHANICAL FAILURE
[3:51:34] <%chiazamformerlymankeyfigh> What did she pick up?
[3:51:34] <%worldbrand> I mean pat isnt giving it the fairest shake, but it's also quite bad lol
[3:51:35] <%Ranryu692> can't hear Paige over the dialogue lol
[3:51:36] <%DesertPenguin> Tell her to speak louder
[3:51:37] <benjiFG> can pat just pull another re6 and turn down the game while paige tells stories
[3:51:38] <jorniev> I'm DEFLATING DUDE
[3:51:39] <%juxtest> I cant tell these characters apart when they talk
[3:51:39] <dante07061947> react to the ending
[3:51:41] <dukenux> I don't HATE it, but i'm not gripped either
[3:51:41] <%Pappajimbo> wait abrams are ABC protected arent they??
[3:51:41] <+SinOmenRoll> we want to give it a shot buuuuuut so far not soo good
[3:51:42] <Samhotdamn> what could save this game at this point?
[3:51:42] <TheAimless> Is it just me or does this tank NOT look like an Abrams?
[3:51:43] <+thedededeman> Still no Undead Nightmare 2
[3:51:43] <+Saltima> what the fuck is this dialogue
[3:51:44] <Sunstalker> Total Overdose > RDR2
[3:51:45] <+Micalica> I'm just furious at how they never stop talking. They never shut the hell up. They are ALWAYS annoying
[3:51:45] <%derap41> Can you feel the love between these two?
[3:51:47] <%GarbageQueenEllie> How are these two women attracted to each other? Even they seem bored.
[3:51:47] <+OwlLightningMage> This voice directing is terrible
[3:51:47] <+BanishedLink> If the skeletons are burnt why are the plastic shotgun shells still usable?
[3:51:51] <RunningNGunning> @mothmandraws the BURNT skeleton that had still functional and not destroyed ammo next to him
[3:51:52] <+Chewygamer> level?
[3:51:53] <starkandstag> It doesn‚Äôt help that most of their dialogue is stating the obvious
[3:51:53] <$vincerocmm> just a couple of guys talking
[3:51:56] <Mantreads> whole lot of notes
[3:51:56] <%cvp5127> why is this more boring than the god of war lake?
[3:51:57] <+Solutha> Asshole killed by other asshoels, LIKE YOU ELLIE
[3:51:57] <auraofdawn> It‚Äôs just a slow deflation of any hype you could have
[3:51:57] <%ragingbrachy> cus ya havent
[3:51:57] <+DZiffer> "What it's in there?" <sees burnt skeleton> "The dialogue."
[3:51:58] <%LegendGHT> amazing chemistry
[3:51:58] <%Pookiedaexzile> It aint coming
[3:51:58] <cipher758> c'mon dina, just shut up and keep walking
[3:51:59] <%einheri> I liked Red Dead Redemption 2.
[3:51:59] <%dinnydanny777> Remember the underground school and the dead skeletons that was super interesting?
[3:51:59] <%ElenaManetta> This feels like the tutorial
[3:51:59] <%Ganerumo> @PatStaresAt you'll get there in another 3 hours.
[3:51:59] <%PNPLost_1> Oof.
[3:52:00] <Gribbin2> This isn't a game it's a statement
[3:52:00] <natebud> Pittsburg was the best part of last of us
[3:52:00] <%czeekyplays> @juxtest don't you know, all lesbians/bisexuals talk in droning, bored voices
[3:52:01] <%amiavamp> But Pat, this IS the game
[3:52:01] <+I_of_the_Storm> The ratio of actual gameplay to story is skewed heavily
[3:52:01] <snaxbuns> Oof sounds very weird in this apocalypse
[3:52:01] <Gruhunchously> The pacing of this game is really slow
[3:52:02] <%ABigPinkLion> I think this is it Pat :/

[3:52:25] <$vincerocmm> lllloooonnnnnggggg
[3:52:26] <IntrepidEye> do you really want to compare this to FF XIII? Because that damning in its own right
[3:52:26] <+CrimsonAscend> Fair is fair
[3:52:26] <FunkyTK> Are tanks shitty enough to be able to be cooked like that?
[3:52:27] <%ElenaManetta> It's slow 3D platforming
[3:52:27] <SubjectX07x> Alright, time for tank nerd shit, how did they get burnt, if it was an ammo explosion, abrams have blow out panels, they specifically vent the explosion outward to avoid exploding the crew. If it was a molotov, the tank was shut.. Did the people kill em then just.. close the hatch, and not even loot them?
[3:52:28] <alrobot2014> oh god i almost said world's longest tutorial until i remembered ff13
[3:52:28] <BurdRightsActivist> GASLIGHTING
[3:52:29] <$iaraCatunda> persona
[3:52:31] <SableDragoon> this is longer than kh2s intro
[3:52:31] <yourliteraldog> GTA 4 had 10 hr one
[3:52:31] <rolpunkexe> they have the most boring ass banter holy shit. "do you remember the thing with the thing?" "yeah. that was a cool thing."
[3:52:32] <%LiquidDinosaur> @Psitterrific we found a plothole where there's "bank robber zombies" at a bank which implies they've been zombies for 20 years because money hasnt meant anything since then
[3:52:32] <AvoidingTheCoronaVirus> you're not supposed to like it, it's not supposed to be fun - ND
[3:52:33] <T_Sasquatch> I don't want the game to shit, but it is
[3:52:33] <dante07061947> you are fair
[3:52:34] <%spiritofmojave> FF13 had amazing music atleast
[3:52:36] <%BubbaRands> Attempt at fairness
[3:52:36] <danie1f> REMEMBER PAT 10/10 GAME
[3:52:37] <%ragingbrachy> yeah we get ya paige
[3:52:38] <%GarbageQueenEllie> It's a bad game, Paige. It's okay, I know- I was in it
[3:52:38] <%EuropanLamprey> The fact that I can think of another Dina that's into girls that's a much better character than this Dina makes me hate this Dina even more
[3:52:38] <%bevyrage> holy shit paige you can't use FF13 as a bar for par that's like saying a corpse jumps real high because the bar is six feet underground
[3:52:38] <%walternatorz> it's hard to be fair when you're spoiled
[3:52:39] <%Arek_1> Don't feel bad.
[3:52:40] <its_menathan> barrSqueent barrHyuck barrScrem
[3:52:40] <+OwlLightningMage> I don't like it. I had more fun with the first one
[3:52:40] <%heartlesshealer> Four hours so far and it's just this?????
[3:52:42] <eyezehuhh> The first game's pacing and hope in the darkness and smaller moments are more impactful than this so far. The motif of finding the daekness in the light was a great message. This game is seemingly undoing that.
[3:52:42] <%wrightlight94> I rather play FF13 again than this
[3:52:42] <KokujinDo> ...everyone wants this to turn it around because a lot liked this series
[3:52:42] <%spiritofmojave> this is so forgettable
[3:52:42] <SomeAsianDood> You're not getting another sony game pat LUL

[3:52:45] <PrettyThickandStrongDyck> won't lie so far this game is boring
[3:52:45] <RubberFistFight> You're both being incredibly fair because you're commenting on what's going on in the game RIGHT NOW and comparing it to the previous game and other "similar" games.
[3:52:46] <RunningNGunning> I want to like this game and give it a fair shot but it isn't giving me much to work with
[3:52:47] <%Xevtes> @PatStaresAt Did we get a cut to title yet?
[3:52:47] <WaifusSansFrontieres> fuck those people

[3:52:53] <lessclams> TRUE
[3:52:53] <+garbotrasho> nah this game fucking sucks

[3:55:49] <RubberFistFight> @PatStaresAt Dude, I literally tweeted at you yesterday "get ready to be wrong no matter what you say." Like Paige just described it's literally happening. The only reason they think you're being "unfair" is because you're not agreeing with them.
[3:55:51] <%boomstickery> and i think its clear to everyone that dina is going to be killed
[3:55:51] <+einheri> lmao
[3:55:51] <%restingbones> OOF

[3:55:55] <%MidnightBurst12> Oh no
[3:55:56] <%de1ete_forever> defund the WLF
[3:55:56] <NaturalGear> it's worse because of the virtue signaling
[3:55:56] <%Xevtes> did we "cut/fade to title yet"?

[3:56:00] <%Corporate_Redeemer> It's 3 self-inserts
[3:56:00] <+Psitterrific> David cage at least tried to make his characters interact and have emotions. Poorly. But he tried.
[3:56:00] <+Taglog7> 100Uckman
[3:56:00] <%doc_ock_rokc> @PatStaresAt Fun fact: heel fuckman actually mocapped the spitting on joel scene

[3:56:02] <%Coffee_JD> the 60 brawn is the funniest part tbh
[3:56:03] <+vampireinarm> sounds like youve been trying to defend his game the whole time
[3:56:03] <ireliaismaiwaifu> how much brawn was he?
[3:56:03] <%mysterypork> HA! LUL
[3:56:04] <dante07061947> Does Pat know the ending?
[3:56:04] <+Shubreaker> if you put yourself in your game and you're anything more than a bit character or some jackoff who dies horribly you are AN ASSHOLE
[3:56:05] <%FluffiTamamo> Only 60 brawn. kick his ass.

[3:56:12] <+Sochin_Iitsu> is it Mind Goblins that's keeping Pat from just beelining the plot?
[3:56:12] <Ids560> really endearing me to the characters by throwing in a "Just doing their jobs"
[3:56:13] <PrettyThickandStrongDyck> Remember keep an open mind about this game ppl!
[3:56:14] <%heartlesshealer> this Young Adult x Young Adult dialogue writing is just greeeeeeat

[3:56:23] <%crimsonphoenix69> It's almost like the interesting part that would make this game interesting are the major events cutscenes.
[3:56:23] <HoIlywood_SN> @patstaresat remember when Kojima self inserted in phantom pain in order to shill a brand of sunglasses he likes

[3:57:11] <catwithsunglasses> Do horses understand stairs? Genuine question
[3:57:13] <LtSolo> IS THIS THE SYNAGOGUE?
[3:57:13] <+spottedwolf10> If Paige accidently cuts Pat can he say he got a paper cut? LUL

[4:02:43] <%Engwithan_Elder_God> Apathy is an emotion, right?
[4:02:44] <%amiavamp> Remember kids, amused is not an emoshun
[4:02:44] <+Radalorian> @PatStaresAt We didn't get the 800 mile journey where Ellie could think about this and talk about it so we have to shoehorn it in at the end
[4:02:46] <@mothmandraws> I had more emtions in my e7s reclear
[4:02:46] <%Chaoko99> look at this loading screen
[4:02:46] <+Solutha> And nothing from Bioware
[4:02:47] <%czeekyplays> Gonna make sweet lesbian love to this skateboard
[4:02:48] <%GarbageQueenEllie> INCEST
[4:02:49] <@ShockzNDrawe> I like how the hypest moment of this stream has been an announcement for a different game
[4:02:49] <Shinny1338> Ska in the soundtrack or riot
[4:02:49] <+CptnCampy61> Skate announced as green lit. There was nothing to show
[4:02:49] <%SirGO0SE> skate 2 + 2
[4:02:49] <+gkingsausagelink> they literally greenlit the devs before stream tho so there was nothing
[4:02:50] <Profmcstevie> Oh boy a skating game, it's entire soundtrack will be unfriendly for streaming
[4:02:50] <%JenovasPuppet> Wow, sexist
[4:02:50] <%derap41> They're very monotone
[4:02:50] <+krymzen5> bullshit u could open tht
[4:02:51] <Vohs_Bru> elderly Tony announced his last game
[4:02:52] <%weissguard> @sofarfetched You can tell that Ellie is really cut up about Joel's death. quiettHA
[4:02:52] <%Dementedpenguin> I genuinely LOVED how glitchy Skate 3 was.
[4:02:52] <$vincerocmm> do a kick flip yeah
[4:02:53] <MayShip> i have that problem too
[4:02:53] <%consistentlylistless> I was just thinking that
[4:02:54] <%UvBenServed> Yup
[4:02:54] <%Nupinoop296> they really sound just alike
[4:02:54] <%ElenaManetta> Same with Abby
[4:02:55] <%spiritofmojave> @mothmandraws LUL
[4:02:58] <%shieldecho> Oh good I
[4:02:58] <+SaltySombrero> Where the hell is Skate 4
[4:02:58] <Ipsenscastle> Throwing yourself off tall things in Skate 3 was the most fucking fun
[4:02:58] <InvisibleMan101> if it isn't called SK4TE I'm not buying
[4:02:58] <ashenjuan25> THEN what?
[4:02:59] <+chattychocobo> LUL
[4:03:00] <%ElenaManetta> Abby, Dina, Ellie all sound the same
[4:03:00] <knyttstories> Thanks Paige, I thought it was just me
[4:03:00] <+JetQuills> Joel died and I don't really care
[4:03:00] <laguerrilha> monotone yeah
[4:03:01] <+OwlLightningMage> The voice directing is bad
[4:03:02] <%GohanHitsugaya> Nope
[4:03:02] <EnoughMold> Skate 4 Hell Yeah!
[4:03:02] <dukenux> WOW PAIGE, SO ALL WOMEN SOUND THE SAME?

[4:03:03] <+StrawberryPantsu> SKATE4
[4:03:03] <%garbocardboardington> Damn right!
[4:03:04] <+nathandiel> Schindlers List
[4:03:04] <%DappercatEsquire> Elle has a little more raspiness
[4:03:04] <redlanternreviews> The fucking mention of Skate 4 got more emotion out of anyone in this stream than anything in the game itself
[4:03:05] <OneThousandTomatoes> TAKE SKATE WITH A PILE OF SALT
[4:03:05] <%BoneofMalkav> Maybe Skate 4 will be our Tony Hawk's Existential Nightmare
[4:03:05] <%DracaenaLeaf> I've been thinking the same yeah
[4:03:06] <toyforus235> YES ELLIE
[4:03:06] <jorniev> WHAT ABOUT THE BAND OF THE HAWK
[4:03:07] <@SoFarFetched> @weissguard cut my life into pieces,this is my last resort
[4:03:07] <theMeNiNBlack6> The have the same tone
[4:03:09] <studleydoorite> I can tell but they're very similar
[4:03:10] <mark_collins45> All lesbians sound alike.
[4:03:11] <+Pilau32> they sound the same
[4:03:11] <%squintypete226> Close enough
[4:03:13] <Amardeux> maybe thats why you get a partner that sounds completely different LUl
[4:03:13] <calamarvelous> They have "teenage girl" voice
[4:03:13] <natebud> Dima is the same character as Ellie. Might as well be talking to herself
[4:03:14] <%GohanHitsugaya> They sound similar
[4:03:14] <%PanicSwytch> Im getting both Tony's existential crisis 1+2 and Skate 4
[4:03:16] <Vashido22> LUL
[4:03:16] <+firstpartypanda> yo! skate forever!
[4:03:16] <%OldManDeckardCain> the sound of a lesbian - neil druckamn

[4:03:18] <gigastanko> pat will you stream the EA direct?
[4:03:19] <bomi1995> no exploring allowed
[4:03:20] <+Psitterrific> Same emoting
[4:03:20] <%ABigPinkLion> literally sounds like the same actress playing two roles
[4:03:21] <%dinnydanny777> They sound like they can't be bothered with the script
[4:03:21] <Vohs_Bru> it is the same voice actress????
[4:03:22] <%hzealot> HAHA can't you zee the evolution of ze tragic girl hero zhe goes crazy after losing the man in her life like this is david cage stupid lvls
[4:03:22] <%derap41> They're not the same actor but they take in the same droning way
[4:03:23] <anymouse233> It‚Äôll be 80 bux at launch with a bunch of DLC and microtransactions with a subscription service 3 months in
[4:03:24] <+SolidusRex> Thank god it's not just me
[4:03:24] <deeewooh> tony hawk is better than skate
[4:03:25] <+attackofthesage> no adventuring
[4:03:26] <TheFramedWarlock> OPEN WORLD
[4:03:26] <+ArtemisCroc> super linear so far
[4:03:28] <TrashLeviathan> they got the lesbian voice
[4:03:28] <%dinnydanny777> They sound like they hate their lines
[4:03:29] <ThDark> Did they tell the VA's to sound as monotone, and bored as possible. Because that's... mature?
[4:03:29] <+michingmallecho> I thought it was just me too
[4:03:29] <%Nope80808> Exploring is Fun and FUN IS BANNED
[4:03:30] <SomeAsianDood> I don't get it. Ashley Johnson is a good voice actor
[4:03:30] <%possumwalsh1221> It sounds like someone talking to themself in their head
[4:03:31] <%Pookiedaexzile> Well you see you can't have a character with an accent be the love intrest in this woke game about lesbians
[4:03:33] <@SoFarFetched> I mean I don't think he's gonna stream the EA direct if it's happening RIGHT now and he's streaming this LUL
[4:03:34] <+gkingsausagelink> no don't reward exploration
[4:03:35] <BioApple> I don't understand how they killed off the main character from the last game like an hour ago and I'm already forgetting about it
[4:03:35] <Eightesu> They have zero emotion just a whispering monotone stoic voice
[4:03:36] <%HaikUnagi> BOMB
[4:03:37] <gyro_gogo_zeppeli> still care more about Tony Hawk tbh
[4:03:37] <%BusterRepukken> @PatStaresAt THPS1+2 and Skate 4 huh, skaters rise up
[4:03:38] <Gorgs7> Big twist, she f'ed herself
[4:03:38] <+Saltima> some of this dialogue is life is strange terrible
[4:03:39] <%Piemen99> bomb
[4:03:39] <@commanderclaw> Why won't they let you play the game for more than 5 minutes at a time?
[4:03:40] <Nelsukako> remember when schinder list was this boring ?
[4:03:40] <%tigerfang86> ????
[4:03:40] <+TylerMystix> "Lesbians sound the same right guys?" Neil Drunkmann
[4:03:42] <studleydoorite> it's not just tone, it's their cadence and everything
[4:03:42] <%Piemen99> BIG BOMB
[4:03:44] <mach01_> DEPLOYING FLASHBANG
[4:03:44] <%blackbaron98> Flash bang?
[4:03:44] <benjiFG> that's not beans
[4:03:45] <%tigerfang86> STUN ZOMBIES????
[4:03:46] <%Chaoko99> Would you not grow up to be a psychopath if you were raised by Joel
[4:03:48] <%dinnydanny777> They sound like they hate everything they've been asked to say
[4:03:50] <%doc_ock_rokc> Stun bomb?
[4:03:52] <%DGenerator> You've DISCOVERED A NEW RECIPUH
[4:03:53] <%SvenHolgersson> Naughty Dog is going to sell Ellie's guitar for $2300 @PatStaresAt
[4:03:53] <+Solutha> THATS A OIL FILTER
[4:03:53] <%Ranryu692> ***
[4:03:54] <+DZiffer> STUN Bomb?!
[4:03:57] <%ceriani1234> AH YES, THROW THE FLASH BANGS AT THE ZAMBAMBOS
[4:03:57] <Radski5> Skate 4 Ft. Tony Hawk from Tony Hawk's Existential Nightmare
[4:03:58] <%Corporate_Redeemer> That looks like it'll do more than stun
[4:03:58] <jorniev> ITS LIKE A DESSERT WITH HOW DRY THIS DIALOGUE IS
[4:03:59] <%Pappajimbo> I know when i kill infected pepole i sound board as fuck
[4:03:59] <joeystalley> should I be drunk for this stream
[4:04:01] <%GarbageQueenEllie> I'm all for that hot gay storyline, but the love interest honestly isn't adding anything here- Ellie should just fly solo
[4:04:03] <+SaltyGhostRock> This game is Schindler's Lisp vineStank
[4:04:03] <%spiritofmojave> This game is just chocked full of absolutely nothing happening
[4:04:05] <%possumwalsh1221> A bomb made of STUN
[4:04:05] <%Aeoneth> First you make bomb... then st it to stun
[4:04:05] <Vohs_Bru> HOW TO MAKE FARTBAGS
[4:04:06] <%FluffiTamamo> @PatStaresAt These conversations could easily be clipped and pasted over a gif of Ellie and Dina just looking through a scrapbook.
[4:04:06] <featherlan> New DIY card
[4:04:07] <joniroquai> Are people being legit about Skate 4? google comes up with nothing recent
[4:04:07] <mark_collins45> How do stun bomb
[4:04:07] <%Faustgesicht> they're low pitched and sarcastic. ellie's just has a bit of rasp to it
[4:04:08] <%Onmi_Khaos> You mean a Desert Jor
[4:04:09] <laguerrilha> @commanderclaw because the player would be having fun, that aint allowed
[4:04:10] <cipher758> we've BANNED FUN over these lands
[4:04:12] <%derap41> How the fuck do you make a bomb out of an oil fileter
[4:04:14] <%sjcodan> WOOO SKATE 4
[4:04:14] <@SoFarFetched> drinking for this stream willl help no one,not even to make the game better
[4:04:16] <+chunkymonkey737> the graphics! because that's what this is really all about and uh...
[4:04:16] <%czeekyplays> @SvenHolgersson of fuck off that's a ripoff
[4:04:17] <MayShip> more games need less "open world"
[4:04:18] <%heartlesshealer> Oh boy. A container of [nothing]
[4:04:18] <%weissguard> @sofarfetched You know, Ellie should just cut to the chase.
[4:04:19] <yourliteraldog> That sounds like a normal bomb
[4:04:20] <Gruhunchously> Look, when you're a hack writer, all you have to do is make your protagonists lesbians and stop writing there.
[4:04:20] <dukenux> Garaj
[4:04:21] <%possumwalsh1221> I can‚Äôt wait for that to not do anything
[4:04:21] <zenith0111> You know what.... this really shits on LOU1 story.
[4:04:22] <+your_big_dad> What up Paul?
[4:04:24] <+mrwake96> It's almost like when no-one has any character or personality they all sound the same
[4:04:27] <+Pilau32> tHE SAME
[4:04:27] <Draco_Renegade> Skate 4 got announced
[4:04:27] <%Purple_badger3000> 25 year old gas!
[4:04:28] <%ElkRiverDog> That map should be dust by now
[4:04:29] <Phoenon> Gee Dina you were good about helping with stealth earlier but now you do nooooothing
[4:04:30] <natebud> Looks like half an M80
[4:04:30] <%Pookiedaexzile> "Well Lets get down there"
[4:04:30] <+NotSoAccurateNo1> this is like when you watch daddy day care and Mrs. Harridan says "They're selling FUN, I can't compete with FUN" but in this case it's TLOU2 versus skate 4
[4:04:33] <%crimsonharvest> video game
[4:04:34] <%dinnydanny777> You'd think that fun would be important in the apocalypse
[4:04:35] <+Sochin_Iitsu> every bomb's a stun bomb
[4:04:36] <%derap41> For Immersion
[4:04:37] <joeystalley> what drinking game should we play
[4:04:37] <Rigid_Iguana> WAGGLE
[4:04:38] <%DesertPenguin> This wouldn't be so bad if there was more background music y'know?
[4:04:39] <Godofmadness5050> how does this have a 96 on Metacritic
[4:04:39] <%Shady_Squid> They sound do bored.
[4:04:39] <%GohanHitsugaya> Booo
[4:04:40] <FunkyTK> This room seems great to have a new enemy variety
[4:04:40] <%garbocardboardington> @derap41 same way you make a silencer out of one, I guess?
[4:04:40] <Goldenwolf98> E M O T I O N
[4:04:44] <%Pookiedaexzile> No comments about the surroundings
[4:04:44] <%dinnydanny777> Gotta stave off that crippling dread
[4:04:45] <%Promessa_EX> hey you are nearing the e3 demo
[4:04:46] <+Psitterrific> Dina is a little higher pitched, but they both barely emote in the same way

[4:08:54] <%Rafferty3231> IT'S BEEN DECADES, YES IT'S EMPTY
[4:08:55] <%Joustar_> NotLikeThis
[4:08:56] <%de1ete_forever> infalmmable means flammable, WHAT A COUNTRY
[4:08:56] <%Chaoko99> GASOLINE GOES BAD
[4:08:56] <+treborant> So what did I miss since she arrive in seattle?
[4:08:56] <+Mouse_Fitzgerald> 30 year old gas
[4:08:57] <juicysal> That giant tank from 30 years ago
[4:08:57] <+Yopie> Did she just put that gas tank in her backpack
[4:08:58] <%Onmi_Khaos> IT'S BEEN 30+ YEARS
[4:08:58] <ennnnnnd> has anything happened yet
[4:08:58] <iwishthiswasicq> Everytime I stop watching for like 20 minutes and come back he's still doing some mundane shit.
[4:08:58] <+Solutha> 30 year old anyway
[4:08:58] <+chunkymonkey737> lol funny run
[4:08:59] <Goldenwolf98> NO GAS NO EMOTIONS
[4:08:59] <BearSawed> Gas does not last that long
[4:09:00] <%ragingbrachy> good
[4:09:00] <+JetQuills> O right they were looking for gas I forgot
[4:09:00] <+xmetalicdemonx> why
[4:09:01] <%Starotter70> LUL AMAZING
[4:09:01] <%Ganerumo> @PatStaresAt it changes the location of the gas to force you to go everywhere
[4:09:01] <SGrim> Giant Tank, 100 gallons, KKona
[4:09:01] <C24U> Those old Ellie is garbage jokes sure came back around
[4:09:01] <%Monkeyweed21> you did it for a jug
[4:09:02] <+Shubreaker> WOW WHAT A GREAT EXPERIENCE
[4:09:02] <%dinnydanny777> Why would there be anything in it
[4:09:02] <It_sjustjoey> WHY are we doing this
[4:09:02] <brachydios777> @cheese_cloud This is gonna be one of those few times where review bombing is justified
[4:09:03] <%spiritofmojave> Story of this game
[4:09:03] <%PNPLost_1> So this building was padding.
[4:09:03] <+Psitterrific> I hate them both so much
[4:09:03] <Vohs_Bru> LESS for nothing
[4:09:04] <%Joustar_> as expected
[4:09:05] <+mrwake96> It really takes the tension out when you don't care about the characters or anything they're doing
[4:09:05] <%gespenst25> YOU DID IT FOR FUN ...NO WAAAAAIT
[4:09:07] <%Starotter70> GENIUS
[4:09:08] <Animorphimagi> FUN
[4:09:08] <Klarrann3> the princess is in another castle
[4:09:08] <Meekest> That gas tank has been here for LIKE 30 YEARS
[4:09:08] <cayenne> at least you got a bullet out of it
[4:09:09] <gomennasorry> YEAH WHO WOULD EVER NEED GAS
[4:09:11] <zenith0111> WOW FUCK THIS OPEN EXPLORATION
[4:09:12] <%ragingbrachy> i forgot why even we needed the gas
[4:09:12] <mach01_> We don't know how long ago the seattle quarantine zone fell but it definitely wasn't a whole 30 years ago, cmon chat
[4:09:12] <%heartlesshealer> mmmmm texture pop in
[4:09:12] <@mothmandraws> no rewards and meh gameplay just add to the gritty realism pat
[4:09:13] <cDoom64hunter> SYNAGOGUE TIME BABY
[4:09:13] <+Cavumentum> You got an empty jug
[4:09:13] <%BinaryFireball> So what's this game about?
[4:09:14] <%de1ete_forever> yawn
[4:09:14] <%honeyman18> But what did you FFEEEEEEELL?
[4:09:14] <%possumwalsh1221> 10/10 I love when quests have no reason
[4:09:14] <BeatBo_2> when's gameplay?
[4:09:14] <Drivershaft> "I did that for nothing" That's the theme of the entire game Pat.
[4:09:14] <+GenesisKnight> Absolutely pointless
[4:09:15] <+Sochin_Iitsu> Aren't you MISERABLE. Are you FEELING
[4:09:16] <Buka_Zero> you did it for druckman
[4:09:16] <%beansoup> remember when games were good
[4:09:16] <+Auriel_Astrum> This just seems like busywork, there hasn't been any plot progression in like an hour
[4:09:18] <Yummy_Nukes> WHY DO PEOPLE NOT KNOW HOW GAS WORK
[4:09:19] <OneThousandTomatoes> new game by the guy who made Brothers
[4:09:19] <emoonimoo> No fun allowed
[4:09:19] <Radski5> Gasoline expires after 10(?) ish years of resting.
[4:09:20] <%ZizerX> IT CAN'T BE FOR NOTHING
[4:09:20] <%spiritofmojave> I DID THAT FOR NOTHING -TLOU legacy
[4:09:20] <%GarbageQueenEllie> This game could only get worse if they added Horse Armor DLC. Or would it make it BETTER?
[4:09:20] <%ragingbrachy> but its for the generator
[4:09:21] <+CapitalForrest> 30 year gas. Hope the have a little seafoam
[4:09:21] <%chiazamformerlymankeyfigh> I bet if you got to the dome first IT'S THE SAME SHIT
[4:09:21] <+chester804> I miss the monkeys from the last game
[4:09:22] <BinaryShuffle> the real gas was the friends you made along the way
[4:09:22] <silverira> Are you trying to have FUN @PatStaresAt ?
[4:09:24] <%Spydurman> it can't have all been for nothing
[4:09:24] <natebud> I bet it's so you have a gas tank
[4:09:25] <its_menathan> psaFist
[4:09:26] <%derap41> Pat the gas is probably going to be at the last place get to look anyway
[4:09:28] <%IroncladAtlas> New Skate confimed 20 min ago on the EA play stream
[4:09:28] <%linSP> GAS GAS GAS
[4:09:28] <+OwlLightningMage> @mrwake96 This. You nailed it exactly
[4:09:28] <+Mouse_Fitzgerald> All gas no gameplay
[4:09:29] <BearSawed> Dont you understand pat, games make you feel things by being oppressive
[4:09:30] <Cestroke> beautiful graphics
[4:09:30] <TheMadBadger> No, you did it for an empty gas container
[4:09:31] <ashenjuan25> Fiiiiiiiiiilllllller
[4:09:31] <therakishsage> Here's the thing. Gas doesn't SELECTIVELY evaporate. Why is that giant tank all gone and not Eugene's generator?
[4:09:32] <%mysterypork> You did it for THE GAMEPLAY
[4:09:33] <%Pookiedaexzile> WHAT HAVE WE BEEN FIGHTING FOOOOR
[4:09:33] <+NotSoAccurateNo1> yo is this just reverse ff13 where you get some free roam but then get stuck on rails for 13 hours?
[4:09:34] <Gruhunchously> I feel like this section would be so much better if Ellie and Dina had ANYTHING INTERESTING TO SAY.
[4:09:34] <+TawnyMonarch> Holy shit I forgot this gas is for one tiny fuckin gate
[4:09:35] <TikanZK> i wish I was playing RE2 right now
[4:09:35] <+Hellhander> gas woulda turned into varnish by then anyway
[4:09:36] <%ragingbrachy> i remembered the generator holy shit pat please stop playing this
[4:09:36] <DSD24> Hey guys how far is Pat into this game right now?
[4:09:38] <Sunstalker> WHy is there a military jeep in there?
[4:09:39] <redlanternreviews> You mean that giant old tank that's been sitting here for like 30 years into a massive zombie outbreak
[4:09:40] <$iaraCatunda> damn if I wanted a boring apocalypse id watch the news
[4:09:41] <collind99> It‚Äôs so You have a gas tank
[4:09:42] <harryjpeter> How's the game?
[4:09:46] <%devanmuse> Any reason why they aren't just siphoning from car tanks?
[4:09:47] <+Pilau32> thaT shit wouldnt move
[4:09:48] <zmuno> THE REAL SHENMUE
[4:09:48] <Godofmadness5050> God this looks so boring
[4:09:48] <%Monkeyweed21> Do apocalypse writers know that Gas expires and is only good for a certain amount of time?
[4:09:49] <%HaikUnagi> Hope they both got tetanus shots
[4:09:49] <%Nupinoop296> they sound just alike and it's driving me nuts
[4:09:49] <Gribbin2> I doubt it
[4:09:49] <Nelsukako> 96 on metacritics....never foget it
[4:09:51] <Poncho_Freestyle> maybe there'll be something fun outside atpFeelsBeardMan
[4:09:55] <jorniev> @patstaresat isn't weird how bored she sounds when she is going on a revenge trip?
[4:09:57] <+mrwake96> has the game even started yet?
[4:09:58] <LtSolo> BABE
[4:09:58] <omen_setter> [exaggerated yawn]

[4:10:15] <Moonlight_Grimoire> how many cars are there to try to even check for gas? Gas that is 25+ years old and wouldn't work anyways? Because you'd want diesel. Seriously they should just go loot the tank's fuel it's a better choice.

[4:13:33] <VJdarkworld> fascist skeletons dont do it
[4:13:34] <%Niney_Who> @PatStaresAt Why won't they take that 100% usable body Armor though
[4:13:35] <jorniev> so everyone killed all the cops

[4:14:41] <SomeAsianDood> CLIP IT
[4:14:42] <brachydios777> Is this one of the worst sequels ever made?
[4:14:42] <%Mekhet09> LUL
[4:14:42] <jowi_time> shines like a diamond
[4:14:43] <Shinny1338> Do you prefer them unbleached?
[4:14:44] <hamsterdavidson> Directed by Hideo Druckman
[4:14:46] <+zooeymainbtw> did the game improve yet?
[4:14:46] <%Dfreddy8> WE KNOW Skare 4 was announced
[4:14:47] <AFlyingTaco1> !uptime
[4:14:47] <%dinnydanny777> I fee like this game is really uninspired
[4:14:47] <@Moobot> I've been playing this game for how long? Oh only 4h 14m.
[4:14:47] <@SoFarFetched> Or when Paige told Pat she will come to him at night and shit in his mouth with her bleached asshole LUL
[4:14:48] <%Dementedpenguin> I would not goddamn pay $60 for this
[4:14:49] <mannyluvsyou> !uptime
[4:14:50] <Daebunz> it seems really aimless and meandering
[4:14:51] <%ItsYaGirlMaria> wait is this game open world? why?
[4:14:52] <$lotharrio> Drinking martinis and talking about bleached assholes. "I'm an alcoholic, Dee." "Well that's no fun."
[4:14:52] <%Pyroclase> this should've been three hours further in the game
[4:14:52] <BrachyZoid> How long have we been riding this fucken horse?
[4:14:53] <%DesertPenguin> Exactly
[4:14:54] <Godofmadness5050> 4 hours out of 35
[4:14:54] <%Onmi_Khaos> has this game made you think yet?
[4:14:54] <%aBlueWizard> They don't want spoilers past hour 12 because that'show long it takes for something to happen.
[4:14:55] <%BinaryFireball> I forgot why were here
[4:14:57] <%dinnydanny777> Like nothing interesting is happening
[4:14:58] <%NeoCre> Cheer500 I hope you are looking forward to a 22-24 hour campaign of this shit
[4:14:58] <+LunarLancaster> Yeah, this should have been before the Joel thing

[4:15:00] <%Pookiedaexzile> And make jokes
[4:15:00] <%sjcodan> GO TO THE SYNAGOGUE PAT
[4:15:00] <%NeoCre> NeoCre's Cheer shared rewards to 10 others in Chat! 
[4:15:00] <%amiavamp> It's the Oblivion Main Quest
[4:15:01] <+KennyK> Have lesbian adventures
[4:15:01] <%Coffee_JD> whats the urgency?
[4:15:01] <C24U> This is kind of like Chapter 3 of The Evil Within 2. But more boring
[4:15:01] <stellaspeed10> Wasn't this game going to be played on Saturday???
[4:15:02] <DE777ON> looks empty af. u sure this isnt early access?
[4:15:02] <%tolloponik> oh 2 weeks
[4:15:03] <%Samus37> why are we here
[4:15:03] <%dinnydanny777> There's no inspiration
[4:15:04] <MayShip> Ellie doesn't even sound like she cares anymore
[4:15:04] <+KingOfTheGeats> they jumped the gun with joel's death
[4:15:04] <%Faustgesicht> joel just died
[4:15:04] <Mantreads> the unblockable setup by Paige
[4:15:05] <%derap41> You don't like fucking around fot Gasoline so you can open a fucking Door
[4:15:06] <%BusterRepukken> I was more intrigued by death stranding
[4:15:07] <dukenux> SHHHHHH Paige
[4:15:08] <%GarbageQueenEllie> Just KILL EACH OTHER already, we know it's coming!
[4:15:08] <fuji_92> why urgency you have literally infinity time for revenge
[4:15:09] <Solidnick18> what about elden ring?
[4:15:10] <+MediocreHermits> while shes telling you the best character in the game is sick
[4:15:13] <%czeekyplays> If this was just a big action muder spree after hour 1, I'
[4:15:13] <%possumwalsh1221> Wait so what‚Äôs the story rn where are you even going and why
[4:15:14] <+rottingpastry> Joel died months ago
[4:15:15] <jorniev> SHE IS NOT TALKING ABOUT KOEL ABOUT HOW SHE FEELS OR ABOUT THE GUYS SHE WANT S TO PURSUE AND KILL WTF
[4:15:15] <%ragingbrachy> JOEL DID JUST DIED
[4:15:15] <silverira> Why all the infected inside the buildings? and when there is literally a blizzard theres like 5000
[4:15:16] <+krymzen5> it really ruins it. like we are chasing down Abby for heartless revenge, but we are having shitty banter?
[4:15:16] <%Idziman> but my murder tho
[4:15:16] <%czeekyplays> I'd be okay with it
[4:15:17] <burstaxe> the environments are really nice, i'll give it that
[4:15:17] <PainfulBuggery> AMY WAS PUSHED OUT OF THE INDUSTRY FOR THIS
[4:15:18] <PraiseHemra> so you only like white skeletons, Paige?
[4:15:18] <%CursedNobleman> LUL
[4:15:18] <%PirateMike_> Well that EA conference was a waste of time
[4:15:19] <Nelsukako> chill time in a revenge plot. Makes sense
[4:15:19] <mak0t0yukii> psaDown_UN
[4:15:19] <%Campfire_Chronicles> that's because neither of them has a personality
[4:15:19] <%myriad_truth> Yeah, their relationship isn't that great.
[4:15:20] <ashenjuan25> Are you Artemis?
[4:15:20] <%dinnydanny777> The Last of Us?
[4:15:20] <%spiritofmojave> YEP
[4:15:21] <%heartlesshealer> YEAH
[4:15:21] <%NovaKnightmare> PFFFFT
[4:15:21] <%derap41> But you're so cute
[4:15:22] <%optimasmaximas> LUL
[4:15:24] <%ElenaManetta> Frisk and Papyrus have more romantic chemistry than these two.
[4:15:24] <%ragingbrachy> YES
[4:15:24] <%squintypete226> They're both deadpan,
[4:15:25] <BeatBo_2> Sam and BB had better chemistry
[4:15:25] <%blastazoid26> ff15 too
[4:15:25] <knyttstories> yes
[4:15:25] <OpenMikeLive> everyone FUCKED
[4:15:26] <%CursedNobleman> jessie humping clouds back
[4:15:26] <%SirGO0SE> ya i dont even want them to fuck tbh
[4:15:26] <+mrwake96> Why didn't scene just happen on the way here? This should have been here in place of the timeskip at least
[4:15:26] <Poncho_Freestyle> ***
[4:15:27] <%Kataguro> FF7R is super horny
[4:15:27] <zenith0111> BUT PUNS PAIGE
[4:15:27] <%Dragovus> Some times you gotta just take it slow in your quest for REVENGE!
[4:15:27] <%GarbageQueenEllie> It made me hot
[4:15:27] <TheMadBadger> YES
[4:15:28] <%dinnydanny777> You mean like The Last of UsM
[4:15:28] <%Joustar_> LUL
[4:15:28] <pikapie> LUL
[4:15:29] <mar_krow> They have body chemistry
[4:15:29] <OneThousandTomatoes> I also want this game to be good Paige
[4:15:29] <AvoidingTheCoronaVirus> ff7 reboot was trash
[4:15:30] <+Ancopro> jessie Kreygasm
[4:15:30] <+Zaramoth> yeah, its trying to put off the passive positive interaction that Joel and her had in part 3/4 but without part 1 and 2's build up
[4:15:31] <+Psitterrific> .... I miss Bill
[4:15:31] <+XxBTExX> chemistry 101
[4:15:31] <$daveronald> dick a lus
[4:15:32] <DSD24> "I ain't your bro"
[4:15:32] <%BubbaRands> YES AND IT WAS FUN
[4:15:33] <sighphers> but that game liked to have fun, patrick
[4:15:33] <%DeadlyJoker29> THIS IS 4 HOURS IN?!? SHOULDN'T SOMETHING BE HAPPENING
[4:15:33] <TrashLeviathan> look at this knock off nier:automata @PatStaresAt
[4:15:33] <+lagmar99> That intro bit with Jessie had more chemistry than like every line I've heard between these two
[4:15:33] <%WhereIsWill> you can ship everyone in ff7r
[4:15:33] <%sniffy77> god I am gonna love the podcast next monday
[4:15:34] <trianglehat> instead you are HORSING AROUND
[4:15:34] <%Ranryu692> that game was soaked
[4:15:34] <bestwaifuritsu> LUL its starting to look like its shallow pandering at this point
[4:15:35] <SaltyAzteca> I just got back are you having the good funz yet?
[4:15:35] <@mothmandraws> but thats not gritty and realistic
[4:15:35] <$RealThiele> RE2 new
[4:15:36] <%korean_random> a lot of sexual tension
[4:15:36] <%dinnydanny777> Did you mean like the Last of Us?
[4:15:37] <%SirGO0SE> in ff7 i wanted EVERYONE to fuck
[4:15:37] <Radski5> Such a list for revenge? WHOOOOOOO?!
[4:15:37] <%spiritofmojave> Aerith + Cloud + Tifa AND Barret would be a poly harem
[4:15:37] <%derap41> No wait she said Pretty
[4:15:37] <omen_setter> that's been in the back of my mind the whole time
[4:15:38] <+masked_hero_lucky> Well Square Enix was probably actually trying to make FF7R a fun game
[4:15:38] <%sjcodan> EVERYONE IN THAT GAME COULD START FUCKING ANYONE ELSE, AND IT WOULD BE LIKE "YEAH THATS FAIR"
[4:15:39] <shotgang86> it was thirsty town
[4:15:40] <%BioHunter> tifa and aerith were gayer than this
[4:15:41] <%SuttonsGaming> trianglehat BOOOOOOOOOOOOOO
[4:15:42] <%ceriani1234> REMEMBER FUCKING GOW? THIS IS SUPPOSED TO BE GOW 2020 FOR SONY!
[4:15:42] <BurdRightsActivist> Maybe if they didn't FIRE the Female Writer of the first game we wouldn't have this problem 4Head
[4:15:43] <dukenux> Kreygasm everyone in FF7
[4:15:44] <%Pappajimbo> that game was so horny
[4:15:45] <%Schrodingers_Box> So replace her with Jessie?
[4:15:45] <%LiquidDinosaur> these two girls are like argon and neon
[4:15:45] <%possumwalsh1221> every single character was horny for each other
[4:15:46] <AxelCezar> it is a really forced gf since the start was already a "well we kissed" without you even seeing her
[4:15:47] <cipher758> punisher and his guns have more chemistry than this
[4:15:47] <+Solutha> ff7r is dripping
[4:15:47] <+chester804> how the fuck did Tommy get through here?
[4:15:49] <mach01_> EVEN THE SIDE CHARACTERS WANTED TO FUCK
[4:15:49] <%xxshadowxx416> re3 remare
[4:15:51] <@mothmandraws> if you want gritty realism everyones gotta be in boring relationships
[4:15:51] <brachydios777> The girl in the dlc last game had soo much more chemistry with Ellie
[4:15:52] <42nfl19> @PatStaresAt They were friends probably in the previous years but it was OFFSCREEN chemistry.
[4:15:53] <PainfulBuggery> Amy Henig's career was destroyed to make this shit game
[4:15:53] <%Onmi_Khaos> This is a game bereft of charm
[4:15:54] <%aBlueWizard> they hired another female writer
[4:15:54] <jorniev> LIKE UNCHARTED
[4:15:55] <%MSN04_Sazabi> They basically have the same personality, Dina is just Ellie from the country instead of a city
[4:15:55] <Shinny1338> But they need to be with someone who is ahead in the poles. and is named Abe. Wait. Ellie is named Abe.
[4:15:55] <+Sochin_Iitsu> fuck remember the chemistry between Joel and Ellie
[4:15:56] <+krymzen5> not after this
[4:15:56] <%Joustar_> All the devs from FF7R need to go to horny jail.
[4:15:57] <Snark_Streams> good to see those incredible animations from E3 were kept in...
[4:15:57] <%GarbageQueenEllie> FF7R was a shipping wetdream
[4:15:57] <%amiavamp> I, too, feel.
[4:15:57] <Gruhunchously> @Plus_On_Black Cascina Caradonna
[4:15:58] <TheMadBadger> Aerith and Tifa becoming immediate friends during their first fight together was so pure and amazing.
[4:15:58] <Solidnick18> what you feel
[4:15:58] <hamsterdavidson> We don't use the word "FUN" up 'ere
[4:15:59] <Psyramics> I feel and I wish I didn't
[4:15:59] <%Stevennapalm> women don't feel
[4:16:00] <%Piemen99> SHE FEEL
[4:16:00] <Moonlight_Grimoire> Again, these writers have _no_ idea how to write dialog and human interactions. It's uncomfortable as a novice writer to see this in a AAA game.
[4:16:00] <ashenjuan25> Chill babe
[4:16:01] <+Das_Prints> So it this part like the Hod of War boat section? Just wander around points of interest to facilitate character moments.
[4:16:01] <+chunkymonkey737> looks like hermione from that friggin' harry potter kinect game
[4:16:01] <OmegaRodo> I know this feel
[4:16:02] <+garbotrasho> I FEEL
[4:16:02] <+michingmallecho> Aaa man FF7make was great
[4:16:03] <Ids560> the biggest instance of characterization for dina was when she threw that jar on the ground out of frustration and that characterized her as a dumbass
[4:16:03] <Vashido22> YES
[4:16:04] <%de1ete_forever> i dont feel FeelsBadMan
[4:16:04] <%Livelinne> ITS JUST A CHEMICAL REACTION woolieMIRIN
[4:16:05] <%Promessa_EX> The game is just being realistic, being girlfriends isn't fun
[4:16:05] <+Kataiser> I've been replaying Persona 4 recently thanks to the Steam release and the character interaction difference between there and here is giving my whiplash.
[4:16:06] <Goldenwolf98> F E E L I N G S?
[4:16:07] <%spiritofmojave> Everyone in FF7R disc 2 will be FUCKIN
[4:16:07] <%Mister_McDerp> but that would be good
[4:16:08] <%AdjectiveNown> ...that's it? She marks down the location and then marks it off immediately!?
[4:16:10] <ThDark> The same exact bag and animation from the bank
[4:16:10] <%BinaryFireball> Imagine all the flirting were missing because it's all done now
[4:16:11] <%AncelDeLambert> Give coin
[4:16:11] <WillyFresh992> boy that EA thing sucked
[4:16:12] <%possumwalsh1221> What are feel
[4:16:12] <Amardeux> Paige these are just token lesbians at this point LUL
[4:16:12] <%Pookiedaexzile> Ashley Johnson can have big lesbian Chemistry, She does it every week with another voice actor in this different thing
[4:16:13] <%Campfire_Chronicles> because then it would have meaning
[4:16:14] <+WizoSavage> You ever had a dream where'd you you where you would
[4:16:14] <KingVantq> was that fake?
[4:16:14] <%Schrodingers_Box> Jessie x Ellie, We needed to see some THIRST!
[4:16:16] <+ratreborn> Druckman bullied Amy Hennig and Nolan North out of Naughty Dog
[4:16:18] <dukenux> ...we won't will we?
[4:16:18] <hoopray> nor will you
[4:16:18] <%segonian> probably
[4:16:19] <+TawnyMonarch> The beginning was rushed as shit
[4:16:19] <sighphers> the marketing HINGED on their chemistry
[4:16:19] <mach01_> MAKING THEM FUCK INSTANTLY MEANS THERE IS NOWHERE FOR THE RELATIONSHIP TO GO, GREAT JOB
[4:16:20] <Leo_Haramen> I feel
[4:16:20] <+MoonObscure> porbably
[4:16:21] <%garbocardboardington> This is a fun-free zone
[4:16:21] <%Starotter70> Guess so
[4:16:21] <%walternatorz> would dina even go with ellie if the weren't together?
[4:16:21] <Flamecap1> Probably
[4:16:22] <reonome> dina wouldn't have joined ellie
[4:16:22] <+rabidclone> maybe
[4:16:22] <%JenovasPuppet> You need to get the lesbians in right away so the reviewers know what to write about.
[4:16:23] <Torgue_1> Could be
[4:16:23] <%trustycoyote> ***
[4:16:24] <doctorbear> It seems weird that they went from a linear game with explorable areas for apparently an open world game with very linear areas
[4:16:24] <%tolloponik> was all that fake
[4:16:25] <%wrightlight94> maybe
[4:16:25] <$lotharrio> I would have thought that's how this started.
[4:16:26] <collind99> I feel that they have chemistry it‚Äôs just understated and kinda naturalistic I guess
[4:16:26] <waifoong98> it's in Ellies's Mind Kappa
[4:16:27] <%Sokumotanaka> Bullshit cloud had chemistry? Is that why in AC he ran off and never committed to being with tifa?
[4:16:27] <+KennyK> It was fake trailers ??????
[4:16:28] <%ZizerX> what a twist
[4:16:28] <+guyremex> i hope so
[4:16:29] <KeystoneA2> They blew 1 million dollars over that shit don't forget LUL
[4:16:29] <Solidnick18> Probably
[4:16:29] <%possumwalsh1221> YEAH PAIGE YOURE RIGHT
[4:16:29] <%Pookiedaexzile> Oh its in the game alright
[4:16:30] <%BubbaRands> IT'S LIKELY
[4:16:30] <%DeadlyJoker29> @burdrightsactivist But how could Fuckman jerk himself off with her there
[4:16:30] <%Midashu> The trailer itself was bullshot, so probably
[4:16:31] <Cestroke> it's not
[4:16:31] <%RyanTheRecluse> probably

[4:16:32] <%Konquerer> you're gonna see it too late for it to matter
[4:16:32] <bluebiscuit94> OMG if this is supposed to be this year's GOW thant it's a fucking failure as far as gameplay already
[4:16:32] <OpenMikeLive> there will probably be multiple flashbacks
[4:16:32] <+OwlLightningMage> That was better than anything we've seen so far
[4:16:33] <%chiazamformerlymankeyfigh> IT MIGHT NOT EVEN BE IN THE GAME
[4:16:34] <%heartlesshealer> Probably tonesetting garbage. Naughty Dog ain't what they used to be
[4:16:34] <%floralkami> seems like it
[4:16:34] <%ABigPinkLion> that was probably the seventh rewrite that got cut
[4:16:34] <%BinaryFireball> WHERE PONY GO?
[4:16:34] <+mrwake96> They got more relationship development in the trailer than we've had in 4 hours
[4:16:35] <$TheCrispyBoi> this game is ResidentSleeper tbh
[4:16:35] <%spiritofmojave> Flashbacks later to stall for 'play hour' time
[4:16:36] <OneThousandTomatoes> I think you are supposed to have watched the trailer
[4:16:36] <+Yakobro> BLIND
[4:16:36] <ashenjuan25> Ellie is just girl tony from Seinfeld

[4:16:37] <42nfl19> PAPER

[4:16:39] <%Mister_McDerp> BLIND

[4:16:41] <%wjones0415> it better be
[4:16:42] <%BusterRepukken> Its a fake trailer

[4:16:42] <%sjcodan> STALE BREAD X STALE TOAST

[4:16:53] <%myriad_truth> SUPER BLIND
[4:16:54] <Savior127> @PatStaresAt This style of adventuring is extremely similar to the Silent Hill games. Even down to how they use map markers.
[4:16:54] <murdocismyhero> Or the fact that all the important points of their relationship happened when they were wasted
[4:16:54] <VERDAXY> thing

[4:27:39] <totally_reasonable_kirb> even ellie's va sounds bored as hell
[4:27:39] <KeystoneA2> In TLoU 1 you'd probably in the suburbs and fucking around with ladders by now
[4:27:40] <%BusterRepukken> this game is anti hype
[4:27:41] <+attackofthesage> yeah fuck your interests

[4:27:57] <Vohs_Bru> Saint ANGER+++
[4:27:57] <%doc_ock_rokc> @KeystoneA2 at least that was intresting and thought provoking
[4:27:57] <+McGwinnicus> This relationship is sooooooooo forced

[4:28:00] <+geckosheer> furry
[4:28:01] <redlanternreviews> Can anyone name me a single personality trait from Dina besides "Ellie's girlfriend". Because I am *really* struggling to get a grasp on what kind of person any of these people are
[4:28:02] <$TheCrispyBoi> this game feels like filler
[4:28:02] <+rottingpastry> It's been months
[4:28:02] <%restingbones> you can't boil with rage at nothing for months
[4:28:02] <jorniev> UEEEAH
[4:28:02] <HumanAdventure> If you're trying to impress your lady friend with an a-ha song, there are way better ones than "Take on Me."
[4:28:02] <AnthonyJMax> anger is energy consuming
[4:28:03] <%dinnydanny777> WHEN YOUR ANGRY YOU SING SAD SONGS OKAY
[4:28:03] <+garbotrasho> EAT HOT CHIP AND LIE
[4:28:03] <knyttstories> zfgMad I think chat's boiling with rage right now

[4:28:03] <%Purple_badger3000> JOEL VENGEANCE can wait after guitar
[4:28:04] <danie1f> ANGER, REVENGE, WHA...
[4:28:04] <Gruhunchously> Ellie boiling with rage would actually make this more engaging, now that I think of it.
[4:28:05] <ThDark> I feel like this aimless wandering part of the game could have been fine if the characters were interesting
[4:28:05] <%possumwalsh1221> Whoever said this is 3rd wheel sim I love you LUL
[4:28:05] <+Spag313> so did the joel thing happen yet?

[4:28:06] <Sajallday> NO EMOTION
[4:28:06] <+DZiffer> The game just dragged you to the dumb fucking music store to "scrounge supplies" to listen to that boring ass sad song, no other reason
[4:28:06] <%muetank> They are trying SO HARD to get us to like this couple and its just so FLAT
[4:28:06] <+Klonoa__> eh its been a couple months now its just a fun road trip with muh girl friend

[4:28:08] <+NitronStreams> This game would be so much better if it was just called "Lesbian Hiking Adventure"
[4:28:08] <Angry_Ev1L> SHE GOT OVER IT

[4:28:22] <Poncho_Freestyle> THAT WAS A NICE SONG... TIME TO UPGRADE MY GUNS
[4:28:22] <AxelCezar> the death of her father should make her personality change, like some john wick level of violence
[4:28:23] <%SinisterBroccoli> Why is she so fast?
[4:28:24] <Samhotdamn> she's an idiot. this who revenge plot is trash
[4:28:25] <Godofmadness5050> oh cool the upgrade system is back
[4:28:25] <+soespookyboi> ha ha he he fun road trip tomatoSmile
[4:28:26] <Crusader1024> Also, how THE FUCK does ELLIE know that song!?!?!?!
[4:28:26] <%stagemage> WHY IS THERE POWER?!
[4:28:27] <+Solutha> It has power? HERE?
[4:28:27] <Radski5> Where's Skullface when you need him.

[4:28:28] <+feMC_is_best_girl> pretty game AYAYA
[4:28:29] <Gribbin2> "REPLACE THE BARREL TO FIRE MORE POWERFUL SHOTS"
[4:28:29] <rubbishbinge> hey this menu looks alright
[4:28:29] <%Reilata> She needs more beard to get to Joel's level of murder rage.
[4:28:30] <korth367> this part is dragging on

[4:28:30] <AFlyingTaco1> Is Joel dead? Like what's happened so far?

[4:28:31] <+OwlLightningMage> ERUPTING BURNING FINGER
[4:28:31] <TikanZK> These animations are really cool though
[4:28:31] <RoboFussin> This game makes me feel like I read a book
[4:28:31] <ToneBacas> MGSV is similar in that regard. Venom is so mad with revenge he can't stop having fun ballooning tanks back to Mother Base
[4:28:32] <+MrWrann> Did she just eject the shell into her face
[4:28:32] <laguerrilha> Damage
[4:28:32] <+rottingpastry> SO I TOOK OUT MY GUN
[4:28:33] <%Pookiedaexzile> THat would be a much better Story, Dina Trying to humanize a cold Ellie with different events along the way....but Ellie has to deny them every time..
[4:28:33] <%SinisterBroccoli> should be slower
[4:28:34] <+rascalrebel> i went running 30 minutes ago and we still didn't find gas

[4:28:46] <UlriktheSlayer1> what about the other ammo shes fucking letting out

[4:30:30] <%consistentlylistless> Beer?
[4:30:32] <HoIlywood_SN> @patstaresat 90 hour crunch week man hours forcing people to neglect their children all to make the video game equivalent of waiting in line to use a coin operated pony outside of a gas station
[4:30:33] <%GarbageQueenEllie> I could get drunk off my ass and still write more charming characters than this
[4:30:33] <jijipose> Bad spiders

[4:30:35] <+artyom47> COFFEE BEEAR
[4:30:36] <Arrowheart17> Any time there‚Äôs stealth or combat the game is pretty good but anytime it‚Äôs just plot or scavenging this game turns into the room on steroids

[4:30:36] <Solidnick18> They have good metal too

[4:30:44] <VoidBeam> Game is a bruh moment
[4:30:44] <katocrimson> because aussie milk is super creamy
[4:30:44] <+JetQuills> no
[4:30:45] <BioApple> is the voice direction for this entire game just "sound dehydrated and shell-shocked the entire time"
[4:30:45] <TheFramedWarlock> Urgh
[4:30:45] <%sjcodan> I'm gonna go take out the trash, it'll be more fun

[4:32:24] <SGrim> @PatStaresAt I think there's a more profound way to tell this stories message even with how it starts. What if Ellie, on this long ass trip, discovers that she has a lot to live for. She then goes home with Dina and lives happily. What Joel would have wanted. You could even throw in Zombies throughout to make them the main antagonists again.

[4:38:32] <+kukadin> what would a dogs overalls look like
[4:38:32] <CrezaK> Hey, just tuning in - who's the new girl and where is Joel?

[4:38:34] <Poncho_Freestyle> hind legs only
[4:38:34] <%Faustgesicht> ask goofy
[4:38:34] <%honeyman18> on his head, cause he's a party dog
[4:38:34] <Alexisonfires> Only in the back
[4:38:34] <jobbedbone> PANTS ARE FOR BALLS
[4:38:36] <%Dfreddy8> Whatever covers its butt.
[4:38:36] <+Snektor> no
[4:38:36] <%ProvingVirus> it'd wear it on its head as an act of defiance

[4:38:42] <+PleasantLee> SHUT UP THO!
[4:38:42] <%derap41> Paige the Fore limbs on animals are generally called arms
[4:38:43] <mach01_> LITERALLY NOTHING HAS HAPPENED BUT JOELS DEATH
[4:38:43] <pikapie> @CrezaK joels dead
[4:38:43] <+Klonoa__> gotta get them for both characters
[4:38:43] <%TurtleButter> @derap41 I'd say, if you want to see that, you're in for a long haul.
[4:38:44] <+DZiffer> This game sure is exciting...
[4:38:44] <%Samus37> damn youll be fully leveled by the halfway point
[4:38:45] <cellularmishap> depends on how the dog would wear the shirt
[4:38:46] <ThDark> Maybe they didn't think you'd explore every building
[4:38:46] <AFlyingTaco1> @crezak You might want to sit down.

[4:38:47] <Srthunda> They sound so soulless
[4:38:48] <%myriad_truth> Watch Zootopia
[4:38:48] <amethyssst> if you did all 4 legs that's just a suit
[4:38:49] <OneThousandTomatoes> worst question
[4:38:49] <+OwlLightningMage> KEEP TAKING PAIGE. YOU'RE MORE INTERESTING THAN THIS SHIT LUL
[4:38:49] <RamenRiderZ> The pants are made to cover ass and genitals
[4:38:50] <boardscanada> is this now open world or is it still mostly linear corridors ?
[4:38:50] <%Starotter70> @CrezaK Bland love interest, and dead
[4:38:50] <%ladomania> A dog would wear two pairs of pants. One for each pair
[4:38:50] <imadeadweight> DINA AND ELLIES VOICE ACTING IS LIKE WATCHING TWILIGHT
[4:38:50] <DeathByPoke7> can the horse poop on you like in mgs5
[4:38:51] <+moink1234> Pat doesn't wear pants
[4:38:51] <+NinjaWitaSniper> I would tell Paige to shut the fuck up, but she is infinitely more entertaining than Neil Cuckmans game
[4:38:51] <%Nomad_Scholar> I missed the itro

[4:40:34] <%boomstickery> ellie would ahve conflict between her buddign relationship with dina and her urgency to rescue joel before he's killed
[4:40:35] <+Takuatt> SkillUp and Polygon are the ones trashing it
[4:40:36] <%Dfreddy8> It's $80-$90 in Canada right?
[4:40:36] <%azure22900> This is not even an 8/10
[4:40:37] <dukenux> IGN hated it too?
[4:40:37] <olaksi> Why? Is he dumbass?
[4:40:37] <%Gallhint> AWFUL GAME, 8/10
[4:40:38] <graybeardhalt> he didn't even score it
[4:40:40] <+NinjaWitaSniper> YOURE NOT WOKE ENOUGH TO PLAY THIS GAME
[4:40:40] <%ragingbrachy> he said it was boring and the story was bvad
[4:40:41] <%AgniBrandt> He doesn't do number scores
[4:40:41] <brachydios777> He trashed it
[4:40:42] <%segonian> money is the main review factor
[4:40:43] <%BestTeaMaker> @PatStaresAt he equated the story to game of thrones season 8
[4:40:43] <%Zombrocom> He doesn't rate
[4:40:43] <%dinnydanny777> Reviewers seem to just outright ignore stories when talking about games
[4:40:43] <MForan98> He's thumbnail literally said "I didn't like any of this at all"
[4:40:44] <Zebroneath> Skillup disliked the story, thought the gameplay was boring
[4:40:44] <+attoram135> No actual score, but he hated it
[4:40:46] <zenith0111> PAT DIDN'T WATCH SKILLUO
[4:40:46] <+FennecZephyr> @PatStaresAt He doesnt do scores
[4:40:46] <shatteredglass4> The horse is giving the best performance
[4:40:47] <StarsCrusader> 10/10 worst game ever
[4:40:47] <%amiavamp> I can't wait for this to be the best PS5 game
[4:40:48] <%wrightlight94> No score
[4:40:49] <%GohanHitsugaya> He was bored to tears
[4:40:49] <snakemuho> There's a really good flashback chapter like 4 hour later
[4:40:49] <Thetruestblacksun> This IS how death stranding felt to those that didn‚Äôt like it
[4:40:51] <+Irridium> "awful game, garbage. 8/10"
[4:40:51] <SleepySamsquanch> One quick change of capturing Joel instead of death. Torture Joel, have them come to rescue him. Have some stakes.
[4:40:51] <Vohs_Bru> Paid reviews?? LIES???
[4:40:51] <%SirGO0SE> expensive 6/10
[4:40:52] <%luftraumm1> specifically bad

[4:40:53] <%riderstrike152> He compared it to GOT Season 8
[4:40:53] <Solidnick18> He said it was game of thrones season 8
[4:40:54] <Poncho_Freestyle> he said he didn't like the first one and he doesn't like the sequel

[4:41:07] <%DGenerator> wtf
[4:41:07] <%Monkeyweed21> People are using him as an example of a REAL review
[4:41:08] <+gkingsausagelink> and the new star wars movies
[4:41:08] <dukenux> O O F
[4:41:08] <%Zombrocom> He liked the first one, he disliked the second one
[4:41:11] <madejustforchat> at the end he was laughing his ass off
[4:41:14] <BeatBo_2> he didn't like the gaemplay
[4:41:15] <Gruhunchously> He liked the story of the first one, but not the gameplay
[4:41:16] <boardscanada> the first one was an overrated cover shooter
[4:41:17] <%AgniBrandt> He didn't love the first one, but he liked the story
[4:41:18] <%BoneofMalkav> Abledgedly
[4:41:18] <%JJCheeker> In 6 is still above average
[4:41:18] <%TurtleButter> @derap41 Yeah, the only thing worth staying up for here is the memefest, but boy is this one gonna be delicious. Either way, your dreams will surely have a better story, man.
[4:41:19] <cipher758> man, this map is really empty. there's nothing here. no enemies to survive, nothing
[4:41:19] <+FennecZephyr> @PatStaresAt He dodn
[4:41:20] <MForan98> HE CALLED THE FIRST ONE A MASTERPIECE ?????
[4:41:20] <reddpop_> dbd afterwards to wash your mouth out?
[4:41:20] <%NeoCre> He despised it
[4:41:21] <BalloniWright> he loved Death Stranding btw
[4:41:21] <FunkyTK> He didn't like the gameplay of the first one, he loved the story
[4:41:21] <Hydrapissed> the horse can BREAK THAT
[4:41:21] <%spiritofmojave> SO SECURE
[4:41:21] <%ThirdWelles> HOLY SHIT
[4:41:23] <%PNPLost_1> GAMEPLAY
[4:41:23] <%myriad_truth> Allegedly?
[4:41:23] <%dinnydanny777> The first was good but it was nowhere near as good as it was made out to be
[4:41:23] <artoflec> the first game isn't very good either ü§∑
[4:41:24] <Radski5> This game reminds me Halo 5 Guardians. The boring gameplay, poor directing of accredited VA's, and overproduction in unimportant aspects. Fuck everything in this stupid industry.
[4:41:24] <%Promessa_EX> Are sony kids still out there getting pissed when games get less then a 9?
[4:41:24] <%Nope80808> @PatStaresAt He said he liked the story didnt like the game play
[4:41:24] <+Thanatoast250> Ablegedly
[4:41:25] <Phoenon> He liked the story in Last of Us 1 but felt gameplay was subpar
[4:41:25] <%ElenaManetta> they didn't anticipate skinny girls
[4:41:25] <%AlphaTauri> that wouldnt work
[4:41:27] <%baronblank> DOG TIME?
[4:41:27] <+Walopoh> This game's story is NOTHING like the first one so far
[4:41:27] <Animal_Farm4> Fat shaming
[4:41:29] <nipplestheenchilada96> TORCH IS ON
[4:41:29] <Blackscience91> The thumbnail says I did not enjoy this at all.
[4:41:29] <R3c0n31> He didnt like the gamplay
[4:41:30] <laguerrilha> fair
[4:41:30] <%biggdaddymike> MORE INFECTED STEALTH YAYYYYYY
[4:41:31] <%ThirdWelles> Oh my fucking god how can they be so fucking dumb oh my god
[4:41:32] <+DZiffer> I want you too look at this and compare it to the time you enter any new area in Nier: Automata in terms of atmosphere.
[4:41:32] <$lotharrio> ...I mean they could just go right back out?
[4:41:33] <%ragingbrachy> thats fair
[4:41:33] <Vohs_Bru> FANTASTIC. AMAZING!!

[4:41:38] <+Shubreaker> Dunkey loved LoU 1 and GoW 4 so it's a tossup
[4:41:38] <$TheCrispyBoi> thats fair
[4:41:39] <%ElenaManetta> THERE ARE ZOMBIES INSIDE WHAT'S THE point of the gate i dont care
[4:41:39] <Calek> too bad there's nothing they have that could break that lock
[4:41:41] <$Sphincter_Spelunker> master this piece my dude
[4:41:41] <+kukadin> so this one has nothing for him then
[4:41:41] <%redrins> kill it
[4:41:42] <Profmcstevie> Hey tall grass, watch out for pikachus
[4:41:42] <%ragingbrachy> he framed the first game on his wall
[4:41:43] <Daebunz> i actually recently tried the first one and had the same opinion. liked story, gameplay pissed me off
[4:41:43] <+seeb_c> BibleThump
[4:41:44] <zenith0111> @draco_renegade Bruh I love how people are like "Oh Dunkey he's gonna rip this game" when he's just some WHO

[4:41:46] <%dmian07> He liked the first one, he just didnt liked the combat
[4:41:46] <%tank7013> Do infected still have bullshit spider sense in this one?
[4:41:47] <AxelCezar> ladders, pliers and tables!
[4:41:47] <%ragingbrachy> :(
[4:41:47] <+PleasantLee> gawd, every time you go into an area where it would be difficult to backtrack from, fucking infected show up, its so simple
[4:41:47] <+smellmycowbro> ResidentSleeper
[4:41:48] <waifoong98> GAHHHHHH
[4:41:48] <henshinforpie> Poor zombie
[4:41:49] <Run44forrest> ??? gameplay was fine
[4:41:49] <@mothmandraws> I still find it dumb there are infected still at all
[4:41:49] <Firststrike_OW> BibleThump
[4:41:50] <gabagoosh> the first game is far from a masterpiece, but it's good.

[4:41:51] <+FennecZephyr> @PatStaresAt He didn;t care for the gameplay, but he loved the story of the first one
[4:41:51] <korth367> he's been sad for 30 years
[4:41:52] <boardscanada> "the Citizen Kane of videogames" - that was the most insane hyperbole ever
[4:41:53] <bleugh> they didn't think two 5'2 lesbians would come through
[4:41:53] <%Chester_goes_Berserk> Different writers for sure
[4:41:54] <Dr_Mooose> :(
[4:41:54] <BeatBo_2> is that us?
[4:41:54] <+dmtjinni> ZOMBOY
[4:41:54] <SleepySamsquanch> That's actually legit. The firsts ones writing was great, game play was clunky even for the time.
[4:41:54] <davey0000> MURDER IT
[4:41:55] <%JJCheeker> Fair
[4:41:56] <+idyota> that zombie was someone's pet
[4:41:57] <ryham_007> BibleThump

[4:41:57] <Poncho_Freestyle> he doesn't know what a last of us even is LUL
[4:41:58] <%Dfreddy8> Everyone has their preferences.
[4:41:59] <bosssbatttle> !runtime
[4:42:00] <%Dementedpenguin> All this grass just makes me want to replay Metal Gear Solid 3
[4:42:00] <%BusterRepukken> How many times is Dina gonna help you through a loading screen into a combat encounter.
[4:42:01] <Radski5> FeelsTLOU2Man
[4:42:01] <ReiDuran> You should just play more DUSK instead of this.
[4:42:01] <laguerrilha> He bought TLoU2
[4:42:02] <%Livelinne> NotLikeThis
[4:42:03] <+Blokehat> zombo got more personality than these two

[4:42:06] <Omega1180> watch out for raptors
[4:42:07] <Gruhunchously> Is the game trying to tug at the heartsrings?
[4:42:07] <VERDAXY> why am I in this game
[4:42:08] <@mothmandraws> by 30 years id expect most of humanity to have started bouncing back
[4:42:08] <%questionablemat> simpbie
[4:42:09] <%segonian> the first one was amazing, that's why this hurts so much.
[4:42:10] <%myriad_truth> Are bottles and Bricks still a thing?
[4:42:10] <%Pookiedaexzile> Who cares what Dunkey thinks he plays League
[4:42:10] <+rottingpastry> knife butt knife butt
[4:42:11] <brachydios777> He like the story of the first one, gameplay was meh
[4:42:12] <@SoFarFetched> The fact that it's telling you about hiding in the grass here,makes me think this will be like Monster hunter that it's all tutorial until you hit the credits LUL
[4:42:13] <collind99> damn almost like people can have different perspectives on video games and that‚Äôs fine
[4:42:13] <OmegaFatalis> some infected just look like crazy homeless people
[4:42:14] <%Rafferty3231> HE'S SAD BECAUSE HE'S IN THIS GAME

[4:42:20] <Mantreads> don't think bout it
[4:42:21] <waifoong98> Shhhh don't think about it

[4:42:49] <$Sphincter_Spelunker> @PatStaresAt no they need to find a nice corner to spore it up in, shuddip
[4:42:49] <%dinnydanny777> This reminds me of Metal Gear Survive
[4:42:50] <$DarkKnightGrave> THEY FORGOT
[4:42:50] <%derap41> Bloaters eventually explode into spore plants
[4:42:50] <snakemuho> YOU THINK THIS IS A ZOMBIE GAME??
[4:42:50] <Moonlight_Grimoire> Legitimately the writers fucking forgot their own lore for the sake of plot.
[4:42:50] <%Rafferty3231> SHHHH SHHHHHHHH SHHH
[4:42:50] <%Promessa_EX> It's just a game
[4:42:51] <calamarvelous> STOP MAKING SENSE PATRICK
[4:42:51] <HODGETASTROPHE> What about the Zombo who took a 30 year shit
[4:42:51] <Kain5707> @PatStaresAt what about the 100s of zombies that were in Colorado that just vanished because of story?
[4:42:51] <%redrins> is this what you get when you fire a competent writer?
[4:42:51] <%Faustgesicht> Shhhhhhhh
[4:42:52] <collind99> some do and some don‚Äôt
[4:42:52] <bleugh> your shotgun would probably be all rusted and shit
[4:42:52] <%Pookiedaexzile> BE SAD TINY MAN
[4:42:52] <%ThirdWelles> WRITING INCONSISTENCIES?
[4:42:53] <bearking05> hackman forgot
[4:42:53] <CrowbarFacelift> fungo pop
[4:42:54] <InXplotch> the fungus is supposed to grow so big that their body becoems immobile
[4:42:55] <silverira> BRAIN 100
[4:42:55] <%devanmuse> they couldn't even photosynthesize in that vault
[4:42:56] <+DZiffer> game forgot, like that gigantic zombie horde before Joel was caught
[4:42:56] <%Pyroclase> maybe they lived int hat bank vault for 29 years
[4:42:57] <%ThirdWelles> CRAAAAAAAZY?
[4:42:57] <%JenovasPuppet> An entire new generation got turned into zombos
[4:42:57] <AFlyingTaco1> The funny thing is, the first game has the most stereotypical-ass zombie plot of all time. But the characterization and world-building made up for it.
[4:42:58] <jorniev> NEW PEOPLE GOT INFECTED
[4:42:58] <gabagoosh> the gameplay in the first game was kind of clunky, but it was really weighty. the hand to hand combat was pretty brutal.
[4:42:58] <Who_lio42> theres a LOT of people
[4:42:59] <%mysterypork> DON'T QUESTION, JUST CONSUME PRODUCT
[4:42:59] <Nostalgiatron_> consistent writing? nah
[4:43:00] <boardscanada> if the user reviews are going to be wildly out of sync with critic reviews, won't the game journos take a big credibility hit then?
[4:43:00] <+krymzen5> they also die pretty ez
[4:43:00] <%amiavamp> Snaaaake Eaterrrrr
[4:43:01] <%honeyman18> Well how are the writers supposed to know that?
[4:43:01] <%ElenaManetta> look at dat ass
[4:43:01] <olaksi> Meh
[4:43:01] <%spiritofmojave> Brain, 100

[4:43:06] <$iaraCatunda> they kinda forgot to die
[4:43:06] <PacOpia> WHY ARE YOU EVEN THINKING ABOUT SPORES??? HUMANS ARE THE EVUUULS
[4:43:06] <+Sochin_Iitsu> BRAIN 100
[4:43:06] <rehkuri> Yeah but if they can't hide in toilets for 30 years to get epic jumpscares then the game will be worse
[4:43:07] <%PNPLost_1> CRAWLING IN MY SKIN
[4:43:08] <Amardeux> not in HEEL FUCKKMAN land
[4:43:08] <lessclams> writing go down
[4:43:08] <Poncho_Freestyle> if you get infected shortly after eating Mexican food you become a bloater atpQuan
[4:43:09] <+abrupt_abe> @PatStaresAt The game doesn't follow it's own rules
[4:43:09] <+AXL808> by this point you would think every building is filled with spores
[4:43:09] <%Promessa_EX> It's just a game, not a serious property like schindler's liost
[4:43:10] <Deepified> BRAIN 100
[4:43:12] <Ipsenscastle> SNAAAAAKE EATERRRRR
[4:43:13] <Radski5> Who cares about continuity we have EMOSHUNS to write.

[4:43:14] <BearSawed> Listen, sometimes writers just forget how stuf is supose to work
[4:43:14] <+NinjaWitaSniper> @PatStaresAt the first one had this problem considering it takes place 20 years after
[4:43:15] <%squintypete226> That grass is not long enough to hide in

[4:43:17] <+popeplays402> This game is just fucking awful. Thank you pat for this lmao
[4:43:17] <mechengineers> sneeeecck
[4:43:17] <%wrightlight94> Big brain 100
[4:43:17] <%RyanTheRecluse> SkillUp pretty much stated that Last of Us 2 is a failure after Last of Us 1 in how the story and characters are treated and that 2 didn't do enough to fix to enhance and improve the gameplay from 1.
[4:43:18] <BourneWarrior> MGS 6 looks tight
[4:43:18] <OmegaRodo> Genius Fuckkman
[4:43:19] <%doc_ock_rokc> @PatStaresAt Remember pat Dr. Uckkman has 100 brains
[4:43:19] <mozgusreigns> imagine narrative consistency
[4:43:19] <PrettyThickandStrongDyck> perfectly still!
[4:43:19] <%BusterRepukken> we MGS3 now
[4:43:20] <%juxtest> That one has a backpack
[4:43:21] <%derap41> What a thrill
[4:43:22] <omen_setter> the first game was very tightly written, even if it was a bit predictable. this feels very loose
[4:43:23] <Yummy_Nukes> you're asking too much for niel druckmann
[4:43:23] <Vohs_Bru> its RE story telling
[4:43:23] <%Idziman> Consistency is a failure of the game designer
[4:43:25] <+hod_fareview> Finally, some zambos

[4:44:26] <Solidnick18> no
[4:44:27] <RubberFistFight> @PatStaresAt it's explicitly shown in the first game that without a source of food, the runners/clickers eventually die, and it's implied that even the bloaters will die off after a while. So a vault full after 30 years makes even less than 0 sense.

[4:45:06] <+AnthraxJohnson> Pat cut your hair jesus christ
[4:45:06] <+mrwake96> This game clearly has no story to tell, and is desperately trying to stretch it out to 25 hours
[4:45:07] <dukenux> yea

[4:45:09] <Poncho_Freestyle> we still enjoyed the stream pat

[4:45:23] <%haitchkay> haitchkay subscribed with Twitch Prime. They've subscribed for 5 months, currently on a 1 month streak! @PatStaresAt the game is around 25 hours long, according to SkillUp.

[4:45:24] <%crimsonphoenix69> Ain't that the point though?
[4:45:24] <sunflowyr> at last i can sleep after an all nighter

[4:45:26] <WillyFresh992> 10/10 IGN
[4:45:26] <%jorg9326> Just here for Pat
[4:45:26] <+battle300> is the game a 10/10 Pat
[4:45:27] <cipher758> Can we enable FUN again?
[4:45:27] <laguerrilha> Not having fun accomplished
[4:45:28] <%Joustar_> "Pacing"
[4:45:28] <%Starotter70> The characters are Cardboard
[4:45:29] <SolGainer> It's not even entertainingly bad
[4:45:29] <totally_reasonable_kirb> it looks like lukewarm water tastes
[4:45:30] <Lucasleonava> People like dull games
[4:45:31] <+LegendaryButcher> sucks to suck
[4:45:31] <WaifusSansFrontieres> you dont appreciate art
[4:45:31] <bestwaifuritsu> @PatStaresAt IGN Japan gave it a fucking 70 LUL one of the only non western entities that didnt give it a shining 100
[4:45:32] <%angel949> as slow as a one piece fight scene
[4:45:32] <%medusasghost> the pacing is SO weird
[4:45:32] <Wannabe_Reviewer> After the first 2 hours you can skip like 80% of the game and not miss anything!
[4:45:32] <%MidnightBurst12> the cardinal sin of media
[4:45:33] <Jmann9218> No Fun Allowed Pat
[4:45:33] <gabagoosh> nothing happens
[4:45:33] <$iaraCatunda> it's just miserable
[4:45:33] <%derap41> first game was slow too but it wasn't dull
[4:45:34] <%ragingbrachy> 'it sucks' - paige
[4:45:34] <%Ranger747> Thanks for the PrideUwu @haitchkay
[4:45:35] <%albret__einstrong> 10/10 ign
[4:45:35] <+LordDukeFishington> Was the first one this boring and slow?
[4:45:36] <kn1gh75> its so you don't have FUN
[4:45:36] <chicken_danger> 10/10
[4:45:39] <Radski5> Joel in One.
[4:45:40] <waifoong98> beloved LUL
[4:45:40] <RamenRiderZ> If it's not fun, why bother?
[4:45:40] <Moonlight_Grimoire> Yeah game is slow and dull. Back to New Vegas.
[4:45:40] <OswaldTheDog> man I was really hopeful
[4:45:40] <%Pookiedaexzile> We been Had lesbian main girls
[4:45:40] <%albret__einstrong> 10/10 ign/
[4:45:42] <+I_of_the_Storm> Cardboard characters. Slow ass pacing that slams the gas pedal for one thing.
[4:45:43] <mach01_> In the time we were looking for gas, the original last of us would've taken us through an entire state doing interesting things
[4:45:43] <gyro_gogo_zeppeli> HEEL FUCKMAN
[4:45:44] <+professormorrigan> misery porn Kreygasm
[4:45:44] <bleugh> slow except for those 5,000 zombies at the beginning
[4:45:44] <%redrins> what is chemistry
[4:45:45] <AxelCezar> BUT 96 METACRITIC THO
[4:45:45] <juicysal> Lesbians were the Selling Point
[4:45:47] <sighphers> there's also no hook to motivate keeping on going, unlike death stranding which had a very slow start
[4:45:47] <%ABigPinkLion> Straight men shouldn't write queer characters 101
[4:45:48] <+Toblo1> Neil Fuckmann happened
[4:45:49] <%de1ete_forever> deleted
[4:45:49] <+Shubreaker> the hotdog water of video games
[4:45:50] <%albret__einstrong> 10/10 IGN baby
[4:45:50] <%Valdorick> Oh right, because Neil doesn't know how to write lesbian characters!
[4:45:50] <%Starotter70> She's lewbian and that's it
[4:45:50] <%SirGO0SE> FORE
[4:45:52] <%questionablemat> BibleThump BibleThump
[4:45:52] <%Monkeyweed21> The slow pacing would be fine if it didn't START with Joel's murder
[4:45:52] <%GarbageQueenEllie> Did they manage to make the fuck scene boring?
[4:45:54] <%derap41> Joel was weak with Female Moves
[4:45:54] <Amardeux> just because a lesbian is the main character doesn't mean its insta-amazing LUL
[4:45:54] <+feMC_is_best_girl> killing joel SUPER EARLY TF
[4:45:55] <%BinaryFireball> I dont understand the plot
[4:45:55] <%dinnydanny777> Joel doesn't even look like Joel
[4:45:56] <korth367> HORSE WAS BEST
[4:45:58] <%BusterRepukken> @PatStaresAt I take back what I said about TLOU 1 being a walking sim,
[4:45:59] <Vohs_Bru> Mr. DrunkFuckMann
[4:45:59] <%possumwalsh1221> I‚Äôm playing Xenoblade rn and talk about a difference in pacing
[4:46:00] <+Solutha> and she is dumb
[4:46:01] <%Gallhint> It's almost as if sexuality alone can't build a provocative and interesting story
[4:46:01] <lessthanhuman_tv> The pacing is both extremely slow and not building anything up before it happens LUL
[4:46:02] <+Thanatoast250> I thought that one zombie was Jesse
[4:46:02] <Gruhunchously> @GarbageQueenEllie Yes.
[4:46:02] <+seeb_c> sadly, political agenda / 10 moon2PH
[4:46:03] <%EuropanLamprey> Being a Lesbian shouldn't be a characters only notable trait
[4:46:03] <$Sphincter_Spelunker> revenge bad
[4:46:03] <+necrocannibal2> JOEL WAS LITERALLY A CAMEO
[4:46:03] <+Fortrify_Streager> She's a lesbian for woke points, and not for any actual reason.
[4:46:03] <%doc_ock_rokc> @PatStaresAt Paige, Ellie is dead. That is Generic lesbian number 10005899328
[4:46:04] <SaltyAzteca> 10/10 across the BOAAARD
[4:46:04] <%spiritofmojave> Why is a straight white ass man writing her and Dina LUL
[4:46:05] <olaksi> Meh, teen lesbians are a copout. Hairy gays in video games 2020
[4:46:05] <%dinnydanny777> Joel doesn't look like Joel
[4:46:05] <+wolfeditor> did i miss butt seckz'
[4:46:05] <Vashido22> BUT 96 THO
[4:46:06] <+NoahilDuce> i joined late, did we see joel die?
[4:46:07] <RubberFistFight> @PatStaresAt But Pat, Troy Baker said on twitter that Naughty Dog has so many awards that the game is automatically awesome. Are you saying Troy Baker was LYING? Kappa
[4:46:07] <OneThousandTomatoes> Joel did basically nothing
[4:46:07] <$iaraCatunda> did Joel die???
[4:46:07] <+chunkymonkey737> this game will put ND outta business
[4:46:08] <+SolidusRex> Hot Dog Water was a saint
[4:46:08] <+DruSM157> It's almost like Neil Druckman never actually directed game, only came in after most of the work was already done...
[4:46:08] <+OwlLightningMage> The whole thing is boring and bad
[4:46:08] <%czeekyplays> @GarbageQueenEllie it was less boring an more nonexistant
[4:46:08] <+TestAnon> turns out lesbian isn't a character trait
[4:46:10] <startstoprepeat> remember all those times in last of us 1 where joel was incredibly suspicious of outsiders
[4:46:10] <+TawnyMonarch> @ABigPinkLion Shitty writers shouldnt write characters
[4:46:10] <JoveGar> is it?
[4:46:11] <%emperordread> I have never been so bored by 2 lesbians in my life. Normally it's a cause for arousal
[4:46:12] <%dinnydanny777> Joel looks wrong too
[4:46:12] <+gkingsausagelink> he'll be back to fuck and then die
[4:46:12] <laguerrilha> Red Dead 2 story is amazing
[4:46:14] <%gespenst25> I can't believe they just went and killed Joel Last of Us like that.
[4:46:14] <@ShockzNDrawe> It legitimately feels like they turned her into a lesbian for wokeness and because she's already a pre established character
[4:46:14] <%BubbaRands> Can this game be just about the horse?
[4:46:14] <snakemuho> THE ULTIMATE AAA MASTERPIECE EXPERIENCE
[4:46:15] <AFlyingTaco1> Yup
[4:46:17] <Zebroneath> Red Dead has a much better story
[4:46:17] <T_Sasquatch> yea he'll be back ...
[4:46:19] <brachydios777> @iaracatunda Yep
[4:46:20] <+NotSoAccurateNo1> this is like when somebody says "watch until season 3 when it gets really good" but the first 2 seasons are bullshit and you don't want to even make the effort
[4:46:20] <+VexicBayn> what a fucking 5 of a game
[4:46:21] <Poncho_Freestyle> the story of red dead is good though
[4:46:21] <LtSolo> the only video game characters should be doomguy or mario
[4:46:21] <gyro_gogo_zeppeli> Its casual bait
[4:46:22] <%Valdorick> Crunch seems to kill fun. Like if the devs aren't having fun, why would the player?
[4:46:24] <bakkatohri> I guess they shouldn't have let Amy Hennig go
[4:46:24] <%tank7013> Is the detail about Ellie super cucking that one guy still in?
[4:46:26] <%tolloponik> as soon as a character gets made into a gay they become devoid of all personality in western story telling
[4:46:27] <$lotharrio> Joel lost all his savvy (remember when he called out an ambush like... miles away?) and just sort of... didn't pick up on the fact that they were surrounding him and being threatening to him?
[4:46:31] <Firststrike_OW> Yeah I can understand that
[4:46:32] <Amardeux> yeah Ellie and Dina is just a token Lesbian couple
[4:46:34] <%DEETRz> red dead had a good story at least tho
[4:46:34] <%GarbageQueenEllie> @czeekyplays lol that's like the opposite of what erotic scenes arte
[4:46:34] <+PleasantLee> You have Troy goddamn Baker, and you have his character die, and he barely doesnt any acting. what a waste
[4:46:34] <%possumwalsh1221> Red Dead was slow and STILL had better pacing
[4:46:34] <%Deano8817> yup
[4:46:35] <jorniev> THE STORY IS GOOD BUT ITS SO BLOATED
[4:46:36] <Vohs_Bru> Like Dark souls??
[4:46:36] <%LegendGHT> any comments to Sony?
[4:46:37] <+mrwake96> When are writers gonna learn that just "being gay" isn't a personality on it's own. You have to actually write a character too.
[4:46:39] <Ragnakawaii> The whole point of the game is to get money, but you end up with millions
[4:46:40] <+kukadin> red dead played itself 80% of the time
[4:46:41] <gabagoosh> red dead started off slowly, but when it opens up, it becomes pretty great.
[4:46:42] <%derap41> Now you get neither
[4:46:42] <+KingOfTheGeats> don't step out of mission bounds
[4:46:47] <%segonian> the Nakey Jakey review is great for that game.
[4:46:48] <%AlteisenReiseZ> IF THE MAIN PULL OF YOUR CHARACTER IS THEIR SEXUALITY, THEN CONGRATULATIONS, YOU'VE WRITTEN A 1 DIMENSIONAL CHARACTER
[4:46:49] <%squintypete226> Gaming has grown up
[4:46:50] <OneThousandTomatoes> that's what I am worried about for cyberpunk 2077
[4:46:51] <%derap41> I just want a TLOU movie
[4:46:51] <gyro_gogo_zeppeli> YES PRETEND MOVIES FOR CASUAL GAMERS
[4:46:52] <BloomingVillain> there seems to be a belief that having a gay character makes them interesting, when gay characters can have more layers than just "likes the same sex."
[4:46:52] <theragergamer1177> Such a disservice to the first Last of Us
[4:46:52] <waifoong98> nailed it, Pretent Movies
[4:46:55] <%de1ete_forever> the schinlders list of lesbian zombo dramas
[4:46:56] <%optimasmaximas> LUL
[4:46:56] <+necrocannibal2> any camp conversation was more interesting than this
[4:46:57] <TheDirtyGentlemen> you can really tell they werent planning to make a sequel cause this story is hot garbage
[4:46:58] <%cvp5127> yep
[4:46:58] <Poncho_Freestyle> very suspicious
[4:46:59] <%blackbaron98> Paid off
[4:46:59] <$pyrotherian> Don‚Äôt forget how they put out a DMCA on the entirety of /v/ for shit talking TLOU2
[4:46:59] <katocrimson> Neil Druckmann is 170% made of movies
[4:46:59] <%BusterRepukken> How is this a 10/10
[4:47:01] <%tolloponik> yup
[4:47:01] <%marvel877> plus, in Red Dead, you got to do HORSE DRIFTING
[4:47:02] <%dinnydanny777> This is a game that would never be considered a good movie
[4:47:02] <+garbotrasho> Yeah I get that now, pretend movies
[4:47:02] <%optimasmaximas> games media LUL
[4:47:02] <ReiDuran> "Pretend Movie" is a great term for it.
[4:47:03] <+DZiffer> But they had sex that one time, though, and were immediately eternal lovers... you know, that forced trope that is shit on in every other movie.
[4:47:03] <bestwaifuritsu> PAID. REVIEWS. LUL
[4:47:03] <+DynDimAcsiwn> @Valdorick you realise most studios have been crunching for decades right? A game you love was definitely achieved under crunch
[4:47:03] <%DakotaMacDoodle> Rockstar needs to stop with the early 2000's rigid gameplay
[4:47:03] <%EuropanLamprey> Because Misery = Drama
[4:47:03] <%D00msDayDan> reviewers fall for it every single time
[4:47:03] <%ZizerX> Yup
[4:47:04] <%segonian> MONEY
[4:47:04] <%godzookylives> The Heavy Rain Effect
[4:47:04] <Calek> God of War ps4 is hella cinematic but it's such a video game too I love it
[4:47:04] <+Blokehat> Bioshock infinite didn't do that to you?
[4:47:04] <%Promessa_EX> These peoploe forget that MOVIES ARE 3 HOURS TOPS
[4:47:06] <$iaraCatunda> bad pretend movie
[4:47:06] <%Quigsies> Games media is a joke for the most part
[4:47:06] <Solidnick18> feels like they paid them off or something
[4:47:07] <cipher758> Interactive Movie
[4:47:08] <Vohs_Bru> Good
[4:47:08] <+informedotaku> it is the media who are wrong
[4:47:08] <Andrizzleton> It's bad game
[4:47:08] <dero45> hate proten Movies
[4:47:08] <+dmtjinni> VIDYA CRITICS ARE EMBARRASSMENT
[4:47:09] <Firststrike_OW> Really makes you think huh CarlSmile
[4:47:09] <lunarcivilwar> THIS IS A WHOLE GAME PLAYING AS JACK MARSDON
[4:47:09] <+I_of_the_Storm> It wants so badly not to be a game. I would prefer not making the character walk if NOTHING IS HAPPENING ANYWAY
[4:47:09] <+chunkymonkey737> 10/5, i wasn't paid to say that :)
[4:47:09] <+abrupt_abe> I appreciate Red Dead but didn't like playing it
[4:47:10] <+Walopoh> This game's story is NOTHING like the first one so far. Reviewers called this a perfect sequel
[4:47:10] <chicken_danger> it's all politics
[4:47:10] <%dinnydanny777> This is a game that would never be a 10/10 movie
[4:47:10] <BalloniWright> this WILL win goty
[4:47:11] <+LastHazzerd> @PatStaresAt Games media is disconnected from playerbases
[4:47:11] <+gkingsausagelink> DmC again?
[4:47:12] <+zanzibar_junker> Its a boring movie too
[4:47:12] <ahaegotrigger> yeah true
[4:47:12] <%amiavamp> Beyond Two Souls all over again
[4:47:14] <%questionablemat> this is a Straight to sifi movie

[4:47:43] <neVan0> YAY
[4:47:43] <ahaegotrigger> HYPE
[4:47:44] <RubberFistFight> @PatStaresAt the explanation for the bad reviews is simple. Money changed hands. It couldn't be more obvious in cases like this. I don't care what anyone says, there is no way those 10/10 reviews are legit.
[4:47:45] <AFlyingTaco1> This is why game journalists aren't taken seriously
[4:47:45] <+Walopoh> How does this compare to the first one's beginning? @PatStaresAt
[4:47:45] <+dmtjinni> IT IS!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
[4:47:47] <%segonian> there is.

[4:48:05] <%Monkeyweed21> no Pat you need to go through all 25 hours to say that its boring
[4:48:07] <%riderstrike152> Pat, it feels like people have issues with the game, but the scores don't reflect that due to worry of getting blackballed for down talking a "prestige game"
[4:48:07] <+Klonoa__> I'm convinced that game reviewers are just failed movie reviewers at this point.
[4:48:13] <%Campfire_Chronicles> what happened with the game? I stepped away for like 10 min
[4:48:15] <%JJCheeker> Every review had the same last paragraph... " it was good but too depressing and I don't want to play it again"
[4:48:17] <%crow114> crow114 subscribed at Tier 2. They've subscribed for 20 months! are we having no fun yet?

[4:48:24] <%linSP> nice ball scratch
[4:48:25] <catwithsunglasses> why would anyone care about the opinion of a games media journalist when it comes to story or narrative? story is literally not the field they chose to cover

[4:50:51] <+seeb_c> they killed off the only character with some balls with a new character with balls LUL
[4:50:53] <%consistentlylistless> That's not a knife that's a spoon
[4:50:55] <+mrwake96> There was like 5 proper encounters this whole time
[4:50:56] <josemoya95> The gameplay seems improved but the level design and encounter design ruins it so far
[4:50:57] <+DZiffer> But you got to throw a cable over a fence, eh? EH? Isn't that something?

[4:51:04] <RubberFistFight> the gameplay loop is 1:1 identical to the first game as far as i can see.
[4:51:05] <Animorphimagi> Like the dlc in 1
[4:51:05] <waifoong98> 15%?
[4:51:06] <%Nope80808> I dunno what I did but youre welcome?
[4:51:07] <%optimasmaximas> GET ON IT SUBREDDIT
[4:51:09] <TheSphereHunter> Did you finish the game???
[4:51:12] <+I_of_the_Storm> The ladder is more exciting.
[4:51:12] <@ShockzNDrawe> 20 minutes of "combat"
[4:51:14] <+gutsmcbutts> @PatStaresAt no setpieces so far right?
[4:51:14] <+dmtjinni> 10%?
[4:51:14] <SchroedingersFerret> How did this game need crunch?
[4:51:15] <@SoFarFetched> He stopped Suzi lol
[4:51:16] <%OmniSTylez> thats a project
[4:51:18] <%GohanHitsugaya> It's bored savaging the game.
[4:51:20] <%sashagreenspiderqueen> @seeb_c trans people have already been done dirty enough by this shit, please dont make them a punchline
[4:51:21] <Poncho_Freestyle> 8 combats
[4:51:21] <%BubbaRands> It's the exact same gameplay and there's too much of it!
[4:51:23] <zenith0111> 5%
[4:51:23] <%Jordanak13> Maybe 30
[4:51:23] <OneThousandTomatoes> how much smoking weed
[4:51:25] <%SvenHolgersson> 70/30
[4:51:26] <%spiritofmojave> Hi Suzi!
[4:51:26] <%azure22900> 5% game 95% ???
[4:51:26] <+JetQuills> hey its suzi
[4:51:26] <bestwaifuritsu> They got rid of FUN. Theres no room for FUN in this MOVIE theyre making. The threat of the first game takes an incredible backseat to the HUMAN DRAMA to the point where almost all of the infected kills are freebie stealth kills.
[4:51:26] <%myriad_truth> SPHERE HUNTER!!
[4:51:27] <cipher758> FUN counter
[4:51:27] <Spyder1246> You just don't like it because a homophobic bigot
[4:51:28] <%OmniSTylez> thats like a 20 min smash cut
[4:51:29] <%derap41> Remember when other people where the danger and not the Zombies`?
[4:51:29] <BaslerJones> will woolie play the game too ?
[4:51:30] <%D00msDayDan> it's the lowest it's been since woolie playing that latest nuns
[4:51:30] <%Pookiedaexzile> 25 to 75
[4:51:31] <%ElenaManetta> The way this game handles mystery is a mess. "Withholding names and motivations" is not a good mystery.
[4:51:32] <KeystoneA2> 25 at most
[4:51:35] <collind99> @rubberfistfight one just differing opinions but also people can flood user sections Because you can post multiple reviews and/or there is no verification that people actually have to play the game to review it.
[4:51:35] <%shieldecho> riding a pretty horsie
[4:51:36] <+Walopoh> How did they improve the gameplay over 1 in any way so far? And the story is definitely so much less interesting than 1.
[4:51:36] <RubberFistFight> @SchroedingersFerret it didn't. They just didn't want to pay their workers.
[4:51:37] <f4ntom98> Like 15 mins of actual combat
[4:51:38] <bleugh> but you played emotional acoustic guitar twice...
[4:51:42] <+I_of_the_Storm> You start fighting humans right at the start with Tess
[4:51:44] <+treborant> maybe 50 minutes
[4:51:45] <+seeb_c> @sashagreenspiderqueen true thats a big FeelsBadMan
[4:51:45] <Hydrapissed> mgs4 ;p;
[4:51:47] <%questionablemat> high end of that
[4:51:49] <%Nupinoop296> why didn't they just make a movie
[4:51:49] <Radski5> Solid 60% of this game is just walking from point to point.
[4:51:50] <%joylent_blue> @BaslerJones he made it sound like he'd do it on his own time but idk
[4:51:50] <%D00msDayDan> no wonder journos fucking love it
[4:51:50] <+dmtjinni> TRASH
[4:51:51] <+NarcissistCactus> this movie is pretty bad
[4:51:52] <%Starotter70> Hollywood
[4:51:54] <+Thanatoast250> There's nothing wrong with combat sprinkled with the rest of the game, but the big issue is that the rest of the game is just fucking boring, from what I've seen
[4:51:54] <gyro_gogo_zeppeli> its just a movie game where critics and casuals can be impressed at shallow wannabe movie
[4:51:54] <VJdarkworld> why they talk so much
[4:51:54] <Triplicat> so is death stranding a better game
[4:51:55] <%ProvingVirus> I feel like the gameplay has devolved into "how do I stealth kill every enemy" and got rid of most of the resource management of the first game

[4:53:10] <VJdarkworld> LISA PogChamp
[4:53:12] <CloudCircus> LISA! Is good

[4:53:46] <%gespenst25> don't they attack you?
[4:53:47] <Radski5> No it was not.
[4:53:47] <zenith0111> WTF
[4:53:47] <Andrizzleton> it was

[4:53:53] <mark_collins45> Not that one doctor
[4:53:54] <%Roasted_Pheasant> It wasn't optional I think that was a joke
[4:53:54] <%GarbageQueenEllie> Pat killed all the docs to save precious trash child

[4:55:40] <%derap41> Joel did everything right from his point of view
[4:55:40] <%oddslogic> why not just give ellie to the military in the first game.they would have more resources right?
[4:55:41] <+mrwake96> Of course we agree with Joel, we were playing as him

[4:55:47] <nerdett> Joel was wrong
[4:55:47] <%linSP> I bet they're gonna lay it on her that Joel was a piece of shit
[4:55:48] <%KingKZ> Joel was a psychopath.
[4:55:48] <Profmcstevie> No that would have made it BETTER because the right decision can still be a rough one to do, that's a whole plot in plenty of stories
[4:55:49] <catwithsunglasses> I feel like if Ellie had somehow died, it would've been a better push for the guilt themes
[4:55:49] <+Psitterrific> joel needed to die... but not like that

[5:05:57] <TriadOrion> Wait, why do the Clickers one-hit kill Ellie if she's immune?
[5:05:57] <@Moobot> I've been playing this game for how long? Oh only 5h 6m.
[5:06:00] <f4ntom98> Oh come on that cant be the whole place
[5:06:00] <%Pookiedaexzile> NEver tell game devs they made something good
[5:06:00] <%shieldecho> You do that in Uncharted Lost Legacy as well but I liked the characters in that one so it was fine
[5:06:01] <%ragingbrachy> only :)
[5:06:02] <+OwlLightningMage> It felt like tutorial the whole time
[5:06:02] <%Monkeyweed21> @SpaceHobo55 oh yeah the Fireflies are too hasty and they're getting their asses kicked hard, but they're also the only people with access to medical equipment that won't just shoot Ellie on sight. Not a great option, but no alternatives really
[5:06:04] <$iaraCatunda> death standin was more action packed
[5:06:04] <dukenux> Yep

[5:06:22] <%SvenHolgersson> If this was a movie it would be even MORE boring

[5:06:27] <%Joustar_> the vines and grass: believable. Trees? Noppe
[5:06:29] <%czeekyplays> It's pretty hard if you're not focusing on it
[5:06:30] <Radski5> Some trees grow pretty fast tbh, but yeah it's a bit too much.
[5:06:30] <%Jrocy247> DR. STONE DID IT RIGHT
[5:06:31] <rubbishbinge> timefall tho
[5:06:33] <$Sphincter_Spelunker> trees exist in cities, bruh
[5:06:35] <%dinnydanny777> SEATTLE'S ROADS HAD GRASS GROWING OVER CONCRETE

[5:06:36] <%Schrodingers_Box> Spores make Trees grow faster
[5:06:40] <Gruhunchously> It's kind of the opposite problem of Bethesda Fallout, where everything looks bombed out 200 years after the war.
[5:06:41] <%Pyroclase> I remember reading Earth Abides adn the author thought metal roadside barrier would last for thousands of years lmao
[5:06:41] <%ShichiNoBushi> Open world games, especially.
[5:06:41] <MForan98> yeah, that's more of a General media problem
[5:06:41] <+OwlLightningMage> That is how long it would take

[5:06:42] <seaechiowai> don't mind me guys just unlocking emotes before he closes stream
[5:06:45] <+treborant> fine
[5:06:46] <%dinnydanny777> THE GRASS GREW THROUGH THE CONCRETE
[5:06:46] <%GarbageQueenEllie> Fine
[5:06:47] <%ceriani1234> so did you find any of the corpse parts in any of that exploration?
[5:06:48] <%derap41> I am Legend did a good job with that
[5:06:50] <%SvenHolgersson> It's almost like Genius Kojumbo has ideas
[5:06:51] <+AXL808> that's some Nier Automata foliage

[5:06:56] <%Jrocy247> Death Stranding has an excuse basically
[5:06:57] <@Moobot> I've been playing this game for how long? Oh only 5h 7m.
[5:07:01] <Vashido22> Yeyeyeye
[5:07:03] <%optimasmaximas> LUL
[5:07:04] <Vohs_Bru> its almost like screenwriters and directors are delusional
[5:07:05] <%joylent_blue> pvpSass
[5:07:06] <%LegendGHT> death stranding is better confirmed
[5:07:09] <+ratreborn> lol
[5:07:12] <AFlyingTaco1> Okay this is nitpicking. You can shit on the bad stuff, but nitpicking every little detail is obviously gonna lead to everything being bad. The first game had issues like that too, guys.
[5:07:12] <patpoops> Watch how this game is actually fine.
[5:07:15] <Releasedahoundz> the dr. stone manga is so much better than this. characters are entertaining, the plot moves forward constantly, and it¬¥s well paced.
[5:07:15] <%Nupinoop296> thanks for answering my question Pat!
[5:07:16] <$iaraCatunda> newwooo
[5:07:20] <%urdumb4twitching> @PatStaresAt thoughts on the Cyberpunk news from earlier?
[5:07:21] <%derap41> not AAA blandness
[5:07:21] <%ragingbrachy> there was some cringers in there
[5:07:22] <f4ntom98> HEYO!
[5:07:24] <+NightSkye09> I wish I was outraged, but I'm just dead inside
[5:07:33] <%ShichiNoBushi> What about dramatic cringe?
[5:07:35] <Radski5> Death Stranding thought of more than not at all.
[5:07:37] <BlueSpartan119> Big Yawn
[5:07:40] <%optimasmaximas> LUL damn
[5:07:41] <%dinnydanny777> The Last of Us 1 is good, this is awful
[5:07:41] <Solidnick18> i had fun
[5:07:43] <+LastHazzerd> fair point
[5:07:44] <madskull456> and you got neither lol
[5:07:44] <+TSmasher1000> LUL
[5:07:45] <+michingmallecho> I expected to murder some dogs
[5:07:46] <%derap41> except for the shooting parts
[5:07:47] <Poncho_Freestyle> the whole time...
[5:07:51] <%driemen> It's because they didn't do anything to the gameplay and ruined the pacing
[5:07:52] <%Typhaeon> It was also fascinating to watch
[5:07:54] <%dinnydanny777> The best comparison is to the previous game, which is better
[5:07:54] <+feMC_is_best_girl> kojimbo is a genius
[5:07:55] <+mrwake96> Death stranding had a point it wanted to make though
[5:07:56] <%czeekyplays> Death stranding had a director who fucking knows what they're doing
[5:07:58] <MrDonTacos_> even detroit was better
[5:07:59] <%Blackmore2323> It makes you wonder how much better this would've been if AMY was back at the wheel. I will never understand why they made her leave.
[5:08:01] <%Scottigecko> the worst thing you can be is not bad, but boring. I can care about a bad game but a boring game isn't worth looking at
[5:08:01] <+SpaceHobo55> The gameplay was trash but the story in DS was good
[5:08:02] <%myriad_truth> True
[5:08:02] <+REDtheBEAST> LUL bukFeels
[5:08:03] <boardscanada> @PatStaresAt and honestly, Death Stranding had better graphics than this
[5:08:05] <catwithsunglasses> @aflyingtaco1 I feel like that's even worse, cuz the problems existed in the first game and they still exist
[5:08:06] <%spiritofmojave> conceptually Kojumbo has a lot of interesting ideas, also solid cast and direction
[5:08:06] <%driemen> Like bioshock 2 does more with the gamplay than last of us dos
[5:08:08] <%Monkeyweed21> would you rather play Last of Us 2 or do a random delivery in Death Stranding
[5:08:08] <+NitronStreams> THE GREAT DELIVERER
[5:08:10] <+OwlLightningMage> This is just boring. Joel dying and Neil spitting on him was the most interesting part
[5:08:10] <MForan98> @PatStaresAt you should really watch Skill Up's TLoU2's review, he talks about just being bored out of his mind
[5:08:10] <%Jrocy247> @AFlyingTaco1 I'm sure no one's complaining about the gameplay, but the fact that this game's story is being played up SO MUCH by the publishers, people are completely doubting it
[5:08:10] <%optimasmaximas> yes
[5:08:10] <+garbotrasho> NO
[5:08:11] <%xcompleasedad> WHOA
[5:08:11] <Nameless0100> OOF
[5:08:11] <Vashido22> OOF
[5:08:12] <dukenux> Yep
[5:08:12] <OmegaFatalis> In Death Stranding you can see Pittsburgh from Washingto DC apparently
[5:08:12] <%dinnydanny777> Detroit was beautiful
[5:08:12] <%Mekhet09> God that's the worst.
[5:08:12] <waifoong98> damnnnn
[5:08:13] <%miguelrod777> damn
[5:08:13] <%DEETRz> WOW

[5:08:17] <%dan_g_v> wow
[5:08:18] <%dinnydanny777> Detroit was a beautiful game
[5:08:19] <%optimasmaximas> huh
[5:08:20] <%Panquake25> BIGGEST OOF
[5:08:20] <%czeekyplays> Detroit is actually like a fun, decent game
[5:08:21] <AFlyingTaco1> @catwithsunglasses That's actually a totally fair point
[5:08:21] <%sunriser101> so dont know if pat saw, but david cage triology of horror just got put on steam
[5:08:21] <%shieldecho> WOW
[5:08:21] <%godzookylives> GOOD GOD
[5:08:21] <%Starotter70> Oh MAN
[5:08:22] <%GarbageQueenEllie> Detroit was a masterpiece compared to lou2
[5:08:23] <%Kataguro> Detroit had Conner
[5:08:23] <%de1ete_forever> cause at least stuff actually happened
[5:08:23] <+Chewygamer> Did they introduce any new mechanics or new enemies or ANYTHING new from a gameplay standpoint?
[5:08:25] <patpoops> So, are we waiting for the game to launch or did Mr. Pat already play some of it?
[5:08:25] <C4m3r0n0409> BIG OOF
[5:08:25] <%Jrocy247> uuuuuuuh
[5:08:25] <%Nupinoop296> DANG

[5:08:27] <Radski5> HOLY SHIT THIS IS REAL
[5:08:27] <%ElenaManetta> Detroit got to the fucking point
[5:08:27] <OneThousandTomatoes> wow
[5:08:29] <%Mekhet09> Even with it being bad it was still a better trainwreck.
[5:08:29] <%Townspoon> D E E P C U T S
[5:08:30] <%Joustar_> SHOTS FIRED
[5:08:30] <Poncho_Freestyle> ANYONE EXCITED FOR GHOST OF TSUSHIMA?
[5:08:30] <%medusasghost> OOf
[5:08:31] <C24U> David Cage beat Naughty Dog
[5:08:32] <%blastazoid26> wow
[5:08:33] <gabagoosh> david cage games are entertaining.
[5:08:34] <%Gallhint> WOW
[5:08:34] <%marvel877> Its because you can see the potential in Detroit.
[5:08:34] <+mrwake96> Bad games are more fun than meh games
[5:08:34] <%czeekyplays> Detroit has its Cage moments but it's actually a good game
[5:08:35] <%SvenHolgersson> PUT THAT ON THE BOX
[5:08:35] <+Nenuvar> Detroit had Connor
[5:08:35] <%shieldecho> fuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuck
[5:08:36] <nox_nyctores> DAVID CAGE WON
[5:08:37] <%DesertPenguin> Detroit was great at being entertainment
[5:08:37] <%dinnydanny777> Detroit has better graphics
[5:08:37] <jorniev> OUCH
[5:08:37] <%BinaryFireball> OMNIKRON OR THIS?
[5:08:38] <+treborant> wow point for quantic dream
[5:08:38] <brachydios777> This is the bottom of the barrel now
[5:08:38] <strategist9> gasp
[5:08:39] <$Tuskor13> Imagine Shadow of the Colossus without all the giant boss fights
[5:08:39] <$iaraCatunda> OOOOFF
[5:08:39] <%Arek_1> LUL
[5:08:39] <%Jrocy247> DAVID CAGE WON
[5:08:39] <%SvenHolgersson> FUCKING NEIL
[5:08:41] <%LiquidDinosaur> @driemen Bioshock 2 has no reason to exist story-wise but gameplay wise its actually a fun expansion of the 1st game's gameplay
[5:08:42] <%derap41> At least they're not Boring
[5:08:42] <%SvenHolgersson> YOU COWARD YOU WONT
[5:08:43] <%floralkami> whole shit, that is a hot take
[5:08:43] <dukenux> Connor > Ellie
[5:08:44] <BalloniWright> CAGE WINS NotLikeThis NotLikeThis NotLikeThis
[5:08:45] <+garbotrasho> REALLY PAT? DAVE CAGE LAUGHING IN HELL
[5:08:46] <cipher758> Detroit had Megaman Conner
[5:08:47] <WaifusSansFrontieres> clip
[5:08:48] <%wrightlight94> DAVID CAGE WINS
[5:08:48] <%LegendGHT> what a world
[5:08:48] <%isolex_> PAT, OMIKRON OR THIS?
[5:08:49] <seaechiowai> Look there must be a price paid for girls making out with each other ok?
[5:08:49] <+attoram135> DEEP JUDGEMENT CUT
[5:08:50] <+BeezusHrist> @PatStaresAt Singing Jesse Williams Kappa
[5:08:51] <+Caidezes> Detroit is out on Steam.
[5:08:51] <boardscanada> I'd rather have Kojima-style movie games than Naughty Dog movie games yeah
[5:08:51] <AFlyingTaco1> Detroit isn't even a bad game, you guys
[5:08:52] <%DeadlyJoker29> OH MY GOD
[5:08:52] <+NightSkye09> lets do another Detroit play-through in place of this
[5:08:52] <%Guardiansaiyan> O M I K R O N
[5:08:53] <f4ntom98> Neil beat David Cage...
[5:08:56] <%Blackmore2323> Even until dawn is better than this.
[5:08:56] <%GarbageQueenEllie> I love Connor. He good boy
[5:08:57] <+wydamn> Detroit was pretty stupid, but it was stupid fun too.
[5:08:57] <%dinnydanny777> Detroit has better graphics, two of the main characters had better stories
[5:08:57] <SirDogBear> David Cage and Pat now have a deadly alliance?
[5:08:58] <%LegendGHT> 2020 is truly the worst year
[5:08:59] <%apolitenoob> WOW THAT‚ÄôS A HOT TAKE
[5:09:00] <+bushlobster69> Detroit is actually halfway decent, change my mind
[5:09:00] <+TomasoChocotaco> wow just tuned in. is it really worse than detroit
[5:09:01] <berserker_103> At least Neil was accurate with "We don't use the word 'fun'"
[5:09:01] <catwithsunglasses> I would recommend any David Cage game over a Druckman game cuz at least he has interesting ideas
[5:09:04] <%Sendrak70> The problem is the game isnt even bad enough to be entertaining. Its just a bunch of white noise.
[5:09:05] <+Chewygamer> "oops I made the bad game" - Neil Fuckman
[5:09:06] <%RyanTheRecluse> rip my message
[5:09:09] <Releasedahoundz> Videogames are meant to be entertaining, detroit is great
[5:09:09] <+Nenuvar> Kojima did nothing wrong
[5:09:09] <brachydios777> Detroit at least had Connor
[5:09:10] <+DrFacilier> Goddammit Neil Druckmann! You made DAVID CAGE LOOK GOOD
[5:09:11] <%antthefool> We‚Äôre in David‚Äôs Cage now
[5:09:11] <+OwlLightningMage> Detroit is even worse written, but it's so stupid that it's fun to go through
[5:09:11] <%optimasmaximas> NO MORE
[5:09:14] <%DeadlyJoker29> Conor and Hank are worth the price of admission
[5:09:15] <%optimasmaximas> MORE SHITSHOW
[5:09:15] <%joylent_blue> YES MORE
[5:09:16] <Shade075> Conner and Hank carry that game

[5:09:18] <%derap41> @NightSkye09 Jessecox is doing one fyi
[5:09:21] <%SirGO0SE> bizzywizzy
[5:09:22] <%Jrocy247> Now all David Cage has to do is to beat Yoko Taro and he can in fact, become a god.
[5:09:23] <%Promessa_EX> Did you put up a vote yet?
[5:09:24] <%callum3434> no more
[5:09:26] <%czeekyplays> @LiquidDinosaur just replayed Bioshock 1 & 2 and the best thing about the improved gameplay I noticed is having plasmids and guns out at the same time. Not impressed really
[5:09:28] <seaechiowai> wizzy bizard
[5:09:31] <+debilitante> never be game over pat
[5:09:32] <cipher758> David Cage must win

[5:09:46] <%Pookiedaexzile> Eat it all
[5:09:49] <%spiritofmojave> It does not deliver at all I'm sorry
[5:09:52] <%amiavamp> Remember, Detroit has cool shit like Violent Markus vs Connor
[5:09:52] <The_Forgotten_Alligator> keep playin so we don't

[5:10:11] <+mrwake96> This should have just been a movie or something
[5:10:11] <Radski5> No way fam.
[5:10:14] <%GarbageQueenEllie> they were too busy jerking off to their own identity politics
[5:10:15] <%Metballs> Wait, you're 1/6 through?
[5:10:16] <%dinnydanny777> But Pat they added a jump button
[5:10:18] <%Metballs> Fuck me
[5:10:19] <horse_disguised_as_horse> Nahhh really?
[5:10:20] <$lotharrio> It's not about having fun, Pat. At all. Fun is the opposite of their objective.
[5:10:20] <%C0baltCrusade> C0baltCrusade subscribed at Tier 1. They've subscribed for 11 months! hey pat! thanks for big strem. ghost of tsushima comes out soon, any plans to stream it? only asking cus it looks cool and i dont have a ps4, i promise im not normally "that guy" in my donos
[5:10:21] <+OwlLightningMage> it delivered boredom
[5:10:27] <%TurtleButter> @amiavamp A legit cool fight.
[5:10:27] <%dinnydanny777> But the Jump button
[5:10:27] <%Nupinoop296> plus all of the characters in TLOU1 were like, interesting
[5:10:27] <AFlyingTaco1> But a large part of the DLC was Ellie fucking around with her friend
[5:10:33] <%Pookiedaexzile> We aint even gonna get a new zombie type
[5:10:33] <Andrizzleton> HOW DID THIS TAKE SO LONG?
[5:10:34] <%dinnydanny777> But the jump though
[5:10:34] <moganline> wow, Pat got filtered
[5:10:35] <Gruhunchously> You really did, it's kind of incredible
[5:10:35] <+jjjkopf> but now the enemies scream luder and have names!
[5:10:40] <%dinnydanny777> You can jump now
[5:10:44] <%derap41> @AFlyingTaco1 "friend"
[5:10:45] <generalve> @patstaresat I really hate that this game is not liner anymore
[5:10:45] <+michingmallecho> Druckmann wanted to make a movie and said ‚Äúslap a walking segment there‚Äù
[5:10:47] <%Pookiedaexzile> WE AINT EVEN GONNA GET A NEW ZOMBIE TYPE (I'm guessing)
[5:10:48] <Solidnick18> but jump tho pat
[5:10:49] <+JetQuills> The Halloween store Was cool
[5:10:49] <+attackofthesage> If you're having fun you can't feel bad, and everybody knows art make you feel bad
[5:10:51] <%MSN04_Sazabi> BUT WHAT ABOUT THE JUMP BUTTON?
[5:10:51] <TheFramedWarlock> BUT THE EMOTIONS PAT
[5:10:52] <+SpaceHobo55> worlds are always better when they are fresh just see dark souls
[5:10:54] <Profmcstevie> Where are the guys with names and dogs, we haven't fought PEOPLE yet
[5:10:54] <playdohface> Uh oh big yikes incoming with this playthrough
[5:10:56] <Ultimatefool> But now you can hear that <randomly generated name> died Pat!
[5:10:56] <$D4C_Trice> Was the crunch worth is Fuckman?
[5:10:56] <+OwlLightningMage> They didn't focus on anything in this
[5:10:57] <$Tuskor13> Sony thought it would be more immersive for their employess to be overworked to the point of becoming zombies so they would know how to program the zombie AI better
[5:10:59] <+feMC_is_best_girl> yeah tlou1 started stronger, albeit linear
[5:11:01] <patpoops> Did you already play some of this or are you waiting for the game to launch
[5:11:04] <%czeekyplays> Pat you really should complete it to give yourself more "credibility" to people who are deepthroating this game
[5:11:07] <Vohs_Bru> Pat there is F-ing in this game, how coool is that?
[5:11:08] <%optimasmaximas> LUL wow
[5:11:08] <seaechiowai> but expensive weapon building animations tho
[5:11:09] <Gruhunchously> I keep saying it, be the section we ended on should have been in the middle of the game, not the start.
[5:11:13] <OneThousandTomatoes> they announced that a new game was being development, that's it
[5:11:16] <AFlyingTaco1> @patpoops He played four hours and was not impressed
[5:11:16] <brachydios777> Squadrons looks good
[5:11:20] <+mrwake96> I can't believe it timeskipped like 6 months and there was still nothing happening. What was even the point?
[5:11:22] <SenranKaguraWeeb> Sad reality game will probably sell amazing and nothing is learned
[5:11:22] <Flame_Water> pat you lok like a model for cheap cologne
[5:11:23] <%Starotter70> I love how this stream about last of us turned into "Fuck yeah, Skate 4"

[5:11:24] <DublinRage> Is it weird that I want to see Pat&Paige co-op Double Dragon NEON?

[5:13:16] <%DakotaMacDoodle> TLOU2 It should have been about completely different characters.

[5:13:18] <%dinnydanny777> If people can write they should.
[5:13:19] <%Ranryu692> @ragingbrachy he was wrong, that doesn't come out until July 17

[5:13:22] <Radski5> I love Spec Ops: The Line but I fucking hate that it stsrted this trend of games needing to be "Serious" and "Real". What others didn't learn from The Line was the subversion of expectations it expertly crafted.
[5:13:23] <%PadreHail> Obra Dinn is chonky if you put the time to complete it

[5:14:08] <%Rancaliber_> @dylanhack No problem man. Stay strong. psaUp
[5:14:09] <%Starotter70> I miss Omikron
[5:14:10] <Bajimxenn> do they
[5:14:10] <rubbishbinge> idk beyond 2 souls was rough
[5:14:11] <BigSaint01> PAT, PLAY OMICRON AGAIN
[5:14:11] <T_Sasquatch> David cage is eager
[5:14:11] <arvym2> not like this Pat
[5:14:11] <%D00msDayDan> except the scenes that don't
[5:14:12] <%Guardiansaiyan> O M I K R O N Remake????
[5:14:12] <%SvenHolgersson> its just dumb!
[5:14:14] <lexitheshark> David Cage takes minutes, not hours, to have things happen

[5:14:15] <MrDonTacos_> even shower scenes?
[5:14:17] <%Typhaeon> That car scene in Heavy Rain was really tensely pacewd
[5:14:17] <Releasedahoundz> Omikron is not a game, its an experience
[5:14:17] <+abrupt_abe> Beyond Two Souls is fucked up
[5:14:18] <%AncelDeLambert> only at times, Pat
[5:14:19] <%medusasghost> maybe it's time to replay some Cage games Pat
[5:14:19] <AFlyingTaco1> My fucking ass they do LUL Did you forget Beyond Two Souls already???????
[5:14:20] <%heartlesshealer> That Feeling When David Cage makes better games than you do
[5:14:21] <%DesertPenguin> BEyond Two Souls is so out of order tho
[5:14:22] <Spyder1246> I can sorta understand what they're going for though, when people die it's often sudden & unexpected. Not always heroic. Still though, I'm pissed they went this direction.
[5:14:23] <%myriad_truth> Beyond was iffy
[5:14:23] <+TSmasher1000> Pat has a point LUL
[5:14:24] <jorniev> BEYOND 2 SOULS IS BAD STORYTELLING
[5:14:25] <+Solutha> Beyond Two Shits desert section was like what
[5:14:26] <+ShovelFace117> TOLUI2 is so bad that Pat looks back on Cage games glowingly
[5:14:26] <%amiavamp> Indigo Prophecy, Heavy Rain, Detroit are paced ok
[5:14:26] <+OwlLightningMage> Quantic dream games have better pacing than this.
[5:14:26] <%optimasmaximas> BEYOND 2 LULS
[5:14:26] <%Pyroclase> TLOU2 from this stream has so much bad pacing I'm tempted to ask if you missed something
[5:14:26] <+condemned_15> keep backpedaling
[5:14:31] <GuardMeShielder> yeah I guess so
[5:14:35] <%Dragovus> @PatStaresAt It's really nice of Neil to take all this heat to make his good friend David Cage look good
[5:14:36] <%apolitenoob> Beyond Two Souls would like to have a word with you
[5:14:36] <chicken_danger> I can't believe this game is so bad it made Pat praise David Cage
[5:14:36] <Ultimatefool> Except for Detroit and Beyond and Heavy Rain and Indigo Prophecy and...
[5:14:37] <%optimasmaximas> THEYRE JUST DUMB
[5:14:38] <%twoto858> Playing Devil's advocate here, but how much of the pacing problems would be due to how much time you spent exploring?
[5:14:39] <BurdRightsActivist> Journalists are just fucking idiots
[5:14:42] <%biggdaddymike> atpRtsd atpRtsd atpRtsd atpRtsd
[5:14:42] <Emaruse> Indigo Prophesy 96% is a time I remember well
[5:14:44] <DeltascapeV4> They're probably paid off, let's be honest
[5:14:46] <CrowbarFacelift> fArts
[5:14:46] <%ragingbrachy> artists need to be stopped
[5:14:46] <BinaryShuffle> Arts full of farts

[5:14:51] <brachydios777> Detroit has a better story and characters and alot of it was stupid
[5:14:53] <UncannyMatt> It's PRFOUND
[5:14:54] <%ShichiNoBushi> F-arts
[5:14:54] <%ThirdWelles> FaARTs read like Cakefarts
[5:14:55] <AFlyingTaco1> Nah they're paid off
[5:14:55] <%spiritofmojave> High f[a]rt
[5:14:55] <%dinnydanny777> I think they judge the game based on the conceit that it's "good for a game"
[5:14:55] <%Newbert> Druckman does look like he huffs his own farts.
[5:14:56] <deeewooh> WHO DOESN'T LIKE THE SMELL OF THEIR OWN FARTS
[5:14:56] <%Starotter70> oh god
[5:14:58] <+NotSoAccurateNo1> IGN gave this game a 10/10
[5:14:58] <$Sphincter_Spelunker> only 5 more streams
[5:15:00] <%czeekyplays> @twoto858 time spent exploring the things the game told you to explore?
[5:15:00] <JPstudmuffin> I think companies twist their employees arms, but devs don't pay off people
[5:15:00] <%Garthunox> God hand got a 3/10
[5:15:01] <OmegaFatalis> They're literally writing reviews for the devs not for us
[5:15:01] <DoobieDancer> Pat really do be looking like that Steve Buscemi picture doe üòî
[5:15:01] <seaechiowai> hard lard art fart
[5:15:01] <%deadsevenvy> I don't think they are paid off, too. Some are all friends with eachother, conflict of interst there.

[5:15:07] <chicken_danger> IT BROKE NEW GROUND

[5:15:15] <%Guardiansaiyan> @twoto858 the acton should feel like the time it took to explore...if it took you 10 minutes to explore then the fights should be about that time....
[5:15:15] <%twoto858> Yeah that makes sense

[5:15:19] <%joylent_blue> oh fuck
[5:15:21] <%dinnydanny777> I think they have a conceit for The last of us and think "well it's a decent story for a game 10/10"
[5:15:22] <+OwlLightningMage> IT BROKE BORING NEW GROUND
[5:15:23] <RayCSmooth> Or both

[5:17:09] <%dinnydanny777> Dina and Ellie's sex scene had no reason to actually happen and no build up

[5:17:21] <emptyantics> How long has he been streaming?

[5:17:26] <%ragingbrachy> theyre fresh dont worry about it
[5:17:26] <BigHugs> Also they just stumble on each other by sheer luck when Abby and her people had no plan, it's so convenient

[5:19:59] <+PleasantLee> Paige, pay attention to the knife and not Pat's ramblings. Pat check her blood to see if shes a changling
[5:19:59] <%DesertPenguin> Fallout 3 was so much better. Things like The Dunwich Building for example. Or the entire Swamp Land DLC
[5:20:00] <f4ntom98> Oof
[5:20:00] <%LegendGHT> Not Fun

[5:20:29] <%dinnydanny777> The Last of Us 2 is no Bugsnax
[5:20:29] <%de1ete_forever> at least Cyberpunk got delayed again
[5:20:32] <OneThousandTomatoes> Were you desensitized to the violence like all the animators and artists who have to look at gruesome shit just make the game more realistic
[5:20:32] <%myriad_truth> Yes, tell us about Dina, Pat?
[5:20:35] <+OwlLightningMage> I felt bored and laughed at Joel's death
[5:20:36] <%heartlesshealer> skate 4 was the highlight of the stream
[5:20:40] <Radski5> So why would Ghouls need a water chip in the first place if they don't need to drink anyway.
[5:20:42] <+bushlobster69> There is no soul to it. The characters just feel empty
[5:20:43] <%MegboyManuel> fair
[5:20:44] <AFlyingTaco1> Issa gud godamn game
[5:20:48] <%dinnydanny777> Skate 4 will be better than this
[5:20:49] <$Tuskor13> The zombie genre is a dead horse being fisted for new ideas
[5:20:49] <$lotharrio> Bugsnax slowly developing into a sleeper hit.
[5:20:50] <%Allenora> It tried to capitalize on feelings the old game inspired. So it‚Äôs unearned

[5:21:56] <%Ranryu692> no sattelites
[5:21:56] <%Pyroclase> iOS updates broke all their phones
[5:21:57] <ELuscious> @PatStaresAt did you see the actress has big ass titties IRL? for some reason they reduced her breasts in-game
[5:21:59] <%Guardiansaiyan> @PatStaresAt Satalites
[5:21:59] <$Tuskor13> She's a romantic interest in a zombie game so she'll probably be killed off for shock value and nothing else
[5:21:59] <UndeadManatee> cell towers
[5:22:00] <+PodreySanchezz> One mother fucker is playing a Vita at some point

[5:22:10] <juicysal> Dina = Scott Pilgrim vs. the World Ruined a Whole Generation of Women
[5:22:12] <%Alopekis> Lots of characteristics but no personality
[5:22:16] <%czeekyplays> She's a bisexual, Pat. That's all the personality you need for modern writers
[5:22:16] <Radski5> If a charecter needs to constantly assert their sexuality in order to have a presence that is not a charecter that is a talking soapbox.
[5:22:17] <jorniev> no batteries my guess
[5:22:19] <%dinnydanny777> WHERE DID THE INTERNET EVEN GO
[5:22:20] <%mysterypork> Ellie was SPUNKY

[5:22:23] <%Monkeyweed21> ellie read pornos and was like Eww lol

[5:22:40] <%Nupinoop296> yeah but those are interesting characters
[5:22:41] <$lotharrio> But she was on a march to a place she knew was going to kill her. So in retrospect her making jokes is super sad.
[5:22:41] <%hzealot> her character is gay girl thats it thats why naughty put her in. thats not shitting on her character thats sitting on ND
[5:22:41] <%sjcodan> @PodreySanchezz You're fucking with me

[5:22:41] <C24U> Kojima?
[5:22:44] <%PadreHail> Dina loves the smell of garbage
[5:22:44] <%GarbageQueenEllie> It's okay if it's an actual CHARACTER
[5:22:44] <OneThousandTomatoes> YES
[5:22:45] <%DappercatEsquire> They're usually creepy or pretentious
[5:22:45] <%SirGO0SE> be bi do crimes
[5:22:46] <%deadsevenvy> They need to be flawed heavy
[5:22:46] <%gear1033> Pat have you seen the Star wars Squadron gameplay trailer?
[5:22:47] <%myriad_truth> True
[5:22:47] <%heartlesshealer> There's a distinction
[5:22:48] <%Pyroclase> A character like Dipper is fine because it makes the protag easier to write
[5:22:48] <MForan98> yeaaaaaaaaah

[5:23:08] <%Starotter70> I have a character and HE HAS THE BIGGEST PENIS
[5:23:10] <BioApple> "man, I was a huge nerd as a child" is not a self-insert

[5:23:18] <%SirGO0SE> HxH self insert RULES
[5:23:19] <%czeekyplays> That's JUST FANFIC
[5:23:19] <%ShichiNoBushi> Those two examples aren't really power fantasies, to they are okay.

[5:23:32] <%crimsonharvest> NO DRIZZT
[5:23:34] <%Nope80808> lol
[5:23:34] <Radski5> Almost. A self-insert needs to be subdued enough to support other charecters, not overpower them.
[5:23:34] <CyborgAV> Remember that guy who self inserted himself into the new Powerpuff Girls cartoon and he made himself Blossom's boyfriend? Shit was fucked
[5:23:34] <%Pookiedaexzile> Shut up

[5:23:39] <%MSN04_Sazabi> HIS FAVOURITE IS JOSUKE PAT
[5:23:39] <Vashido22> @patstaresat wasn't Sol Badguy Daisuke's alter ego/self-insert?
[5:23:40] <MForan98> There's a difference between having one that's Masturbatory and one that's just casually part of the story @PatStaresAt
[5:23:41] <%Nope80808> I REFUSE
[5:23:42] <+gustavozxd> he said rohan is not his fav tho right?
[5:23:42] <+mrwake96> Ellie existed in the first game to counteract Joel's personality and is the reason for the plot, Dina exists to be the player's follower
[5:23:43] <%Promessa_EX> No, his favorite is Jotaro, he says so
[5:23:43] <%saadi90> Kojima in Ground Zeroes was cool
[5:23:44] <%Monkeyweed21> the director of Hardcore Henry inserted himself as a random mook that gets killed right away
[5:23:44] <%SirGO0SE> he claims his favorite is josuke but i dont believe him
[5:23:44] <+Solutha> Rohan is an asshole tho
