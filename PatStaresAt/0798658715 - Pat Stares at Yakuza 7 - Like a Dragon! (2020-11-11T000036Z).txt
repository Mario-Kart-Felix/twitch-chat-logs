[0:01:35] <Broken_Sonex> So, the thing that strikes me as odd, is that the people I know who have played Judgment always listen to the original Japanese voices. However, when they play Persona games, they always listen to the English dub. Both Yakuza and Persona are Japanese games that are both set in Japan, and yet, the languages that people prefer hearing are different
[0:01:37] <+Draco_Renegade> I can't wait to watch this DUBBED playthrough.
[0:01:40] <%twiiula> Dub
