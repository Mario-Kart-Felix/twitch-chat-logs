[0:17:32] <@SoFarFetched> for Hinako
[0:17:37] <+Dova573> Angel is cool but shes so hard to play
[0:17:46] <%echobee_tv> Absolutely
[0:17:52] <%Aeoneth> THis is truth
[0:17:53] <@SSaryn> MUCH.
[0:17:56] <%RedMageRebel> is KOF good for someone who isn't good at fighters
[0:17:59] <$Futurecity10> Yeah but if you dont have internet you cant experience the ending for Rise
[0:17:59] <%Aeoneth> Outriders went sour fast
[0:18:02] <%JoshManVGH> And it works. Reliably.
[0:18:24] <+BusterRepukken> @RedMageRebel I mean... maybe? Hard question. The newer ones have definitely gotten easier to get into.
[0:18:26] <herotony04> Wiat i just got here. Is strem over?
[0:18:26] <Tracazoid> It's nice when games with online features work offline. It's almost as if that should be a standard.
[0:18:27] <scrumbotime> Would you rather play a 10 out of 10 or like, a 7 or 8 that you can't play anyway
[0:18:28] <@SoFarFetched> Outriders shat itself too fast
[0:18:40] <tolloponik> @RedMageRebel no but they are trying to help out the ownes that need it
[0:18:42] <Profmcstevie> Monster Hunters been surviving on that 10/10 gameplay for a long time, cos it sure as hell wasn't the PS2 graphics for all those years

[0:22:55] <%rottingpastry> so is this some sort of tower that one might murder?
[0:23:23] <@SSaryn> New, no new mechanics here.
[0:23:31] <@SSaryn> Old I mean, fuck
[0:23:35] <$lumporr> hey, this isn't a dead cell
[0:23:35] <Xenioplate> Did I miss the pre-stream?
[0:23:37] <$Ziegsy> this is on ps5 now. Im a tempted
[0:23:48] <%RedMageRebel> is this a cthulu thing, with corruption/sanity effects?
[0:23:48] <+BusterRepukken> hey how goes the Fortnites off stream
[0:23:50] <%Skelefellah> Are Greed Kills attacking when you're about to get hit?
[0:23:55] <%Skelefellah> That's a neat mechanic if so
[0:24:05] <%bassoontyphoon> @Xenioplate yes but stream started at 11 so you didnt miss much
[0:24:07] <scrumbotime> No it's just a kill combo meter
[0:24:08] <Xenioplate> This isn't Fortnite
[0:24:08] <%zeroarturia> Hey Pat have you seen the House of the dead remake trailer?
[0:24:18] <%Skelefellah> Ah gotcha.
[0:24:18] <+rbakervv> @Skelefellah greed kills are killing fast without getting hit
[0:24:26] <@SSaryn> Oh actually there is a new mechanic, kind of. New weapon, Bombs. Works a bit differently than the others.
[0:24:45] <Saltmeisterr> bombs you say...
[0:24:45] <%Skelefellah> Huh, so like a style function where it's just going for that no-hit-clear.
[0:24:46] <$Ziegsy> did anyone else see that new game konamis putting out. Looks like blasphemous in japan
[0:24:53] <Xenioplate> @Xenioplate Oh sweet

[0:39:51] <%Skelefellah> Oh huh. Scorpion pull with the whip. That's cool.
[0:40:15] <Psyramics> they've tried to stop me and they have failed every time
[0:40:24] <lloyddboy> why rotate a cow when you can make it dance in polish
[0:40:27] <+Euphbugg> They might not be able to stop mind cow rotation, but they always try D:

[0:43:43] <+MrBaldachin> the third hit on the throwing knives being slower/higher damage seems extremely useless
[0:43:44] <bettysharkface> Is the curse juice similar to the bone hurting juice?
[0:43:51] <amonimis> shoulda imbibed in that curse juice

[0:46:43] <+athuramn> there's a downside to expanding your weapon pool with weapons you won't actually enjoy using
[0:46:45] <+athuramn> btw
[0:46:59] <@SSaryn> Honestly, banishing weapons is for losers Kappa
[0:47:14] <@SSaryn> But to be fair, I also don't like doing it anyway.
[0:47:17] <%Skelefellah> Banishing is the coward's way out
[0:47:42] <%Skelefellah> Cheeky

[0:48:03] <@SSaryn> Mhmm.
[0:48:04] <ArcaneMusic> It's okay pat, joke later
[0:48:04] <+athuramn> is he having a stroke
[0:48:07] <Psyramics> you can do it Pat
[0:48:08] <IminyourBase> stop having strokes
[0:48:09] <+TheBitingIrish> NotLikeThis

[0:49:11] <%rottingpastry> an effigy of a taint
[0:49:13] <%GalacticaPhanto> @patstaresat just got here, hopefully your headache isn't bothering you
[0:49:23] <@SSaryn> Torch helps you know what traps even are.
[0:49:26] <+athuramn> you use it in conjunction with bonuses that give dmg + in light
[0:49:29] <ArcaneMusic> So, this is like ancient mayan hades with a slay the spire minimap?
[0:49:33] <Manwad> enemies do more damage in the dark
[0:49:33] <RWLJr98> you're wrong, idk why tho :)
[0:49:35] <+athuramn> and it can light enemies on fire, which combos with poison
[0:49:35] <@SSaryn> They glow in darkness.
[0:49:48] <ArcaneMusic> Does this have multiplayer?
[0:49:50] <IminyourBase> do you hate vision?
[0:49:51] <%Skelefellah> Style points for gold
[0:49:54] <+Euphbugg> LUL
[0:49:58] <adeliciousbowlofsoup> younalso take less damage in  light
[0:49:59] <%Skelefellah> Style's always worth trying.
[0:50:04] <+athuramn> @Manwad that's probably the most important reason lol
[0:50:05] <@SSaryn> You had the right idea cause you at least can parry them.
[0:50:25] <%rottingpastry> you can't take two at once
[0:50:27] <@SSaryn> No definitely not.
[0:50:57] <%RigmaroleHM> psaDogchamp psaDogchamp

[0:51:05] <%Ranryu692> you can only take two at once if your elasticity is high
[0:51:11] <PinoProxie> how long until zangief develops his own stink lines
[0:51:14] <%valriot> Wait, i thought Pat had a Brain Fire
[0:51:18] <+TheBitingIrish> I like giving my dog baby carrots every so often :)
[0:51:20] <amonimis> but they're dead
[0:51:21] <%JoshManVGH> Did Zangiefs father ever eat biscuits?
[0:51:39] <%valriot> LUL oh ok
[0:51:41] <@SSaryn> Instead of an 8, he's now at like a 3.
[0:51:43] <$Dakuu75> So, does this game have a story or conclusion or something? Why is this poor schmuck cursing himself super hard jsut to explore this tomb or w/e?
[0:51:45] <%Skelefellah> The brain's leaking into the word salad.
[0:51:54] <vilecrois> When will you teach zangief to play meelee? He already has the smell down.
[0:51:56] <Admiral_PopnFresh> this looks like slow Hades
[0:52:01] <+Dova573> Guys one step from eden or moonlighter?
[0:52:03] <%rottingpastry> looks like a curse and buff cannon

Eden's nuts, with a new update allowing for way more builds.   different games totally, but Eden has a way higher ceiling for the crazy shit you can get rolling in it.
[0:55:11] <vilecrois> what's that smell

[0:58:10] <$Dakuu75> I think he lost more HP to traps than enemies there
[0:58:15] <+athuramn> @Dova573 agreed on eden. It's definitely hard if you've never played a game like it before but it's incredibly engaging
[0:58:19] <+TheBitingIrish> o neat
[0:58:25] <%JoshManVGH> So is a full run the completion of that map?
[0:58:25] <tanarath> Does fighting in darkness giver pat more rewards?

[0:58:48] <@SSaryn> It's a super legit Charging Star too.
[0:58:52] <+rbakervv> @tanarath nope, just makes him take more damage
[0:59:03] <+MugenSandan> Remember to always never sometimes probably but certainly definitely not drop your shield

[1:05:46] <%AncelDeLambert> @PatStaresAt rats can swim
[1:05:46] <Psyramics> Hancock is famous for having a big obvious signature

[1:05:51] <amonimis> cuz Hancock had a huge signature
[1:05:51] <ammobasket> Jouhn hancock signed his name super huge

[1:12:31] <%Alazull> Both
[1:12:34] <amonimis> yes
[1:12:57] <+TheBitingIrish> Mostly a Hades
[1:13:15] <@SSaryn> Yes to both.
[1:13:16] <@Moobot> Hey check out Curse of the Dead Gods here! It got a big update and it's on sale! https://bit.ly/329oaPc
[1:13:27] <%aWanderingKaivo> I touched this a bit a while back, anything big interesting with this update
[1:13:30] <@SSaryn> Little bit of Darkest Dungeon as well.
[1:13:35] <+ShutUpAceyP> does anyone else have the effect of pats stream replaying parts then fastforwarding to current?
[1:13:36] <%dekkitout> Now that's a lotta damage
[1:13:52] <%Breaknoon> @ShutUpAceyP yes
[1:13:52] <%Alazull> This Hand Cock weapon
[1:13:58] <amonimis> @shutupaceyp ye
[1:14:02] <@SSaryn> @ShutUpAceyP That sometimes just happens, I'd reload if you're still having that issue.
[1:14:03] <%superdeliverer> This update added 3 weapons and a Dead Cells curse
[1:14:17] <masterfire23> @shutupaceyp it happens when the quality is set to auto
[1:14:23] <+ShutUpAceyP> @SSaryn it still does it after relaoding
[1:14:27] <%aWanderingKaivo> wow ok that's fairly substantial
[1:14:34] <%dekkitout> sbfpYeyeye
[1:14:38] <+xBolts4Lifex> was that the cleric beast noise?
[1:14:39] <@SSaryn> @ShutUpAceyP Ah ok, try changing resolutions too, that might help.
[1:14:45] <+ShutUpAceyP> @masterfire23 oh wow that fixed it
[1:14:45] <@SSaryn> Quality I mean
[1:14:45] <+swesterly> how does this fare against Hades
[1:14:49] <masterfire23> @shutupaceyp change quality settings from auto
[1:15:07] <+ShutUpAceyP> all better now. fixed Pat stream
[1:15:13] <%Breaknoon> Thanks for the fix
[1:15:22] <%Fooguwu> Migraines are crazy. I've had two that mimicked a stroke, I forgot language and time and lost right side vision, couldnt control my right side

[1:17:49] <aguynamedd> RPGYonger
[1:18:03] <lloyddboy> poison dynamite
[1:18:04] <+athuramn> except that it did more damage against poisoned enemies
[1:18:06] <%californaya> Friendship with dynamite is over
[1:18:09] <+athuramn> but, y'know
[1:18:15] <@SSaryn> You're just salty cause bombs don't do contact damage except for that one that totally does.
[1:18:19] <Saltmeisterr> BUT it had damage to poison
[1:18:35] <+SteinsApprentice> "
[1:18:42] <%aWanderingKaivo> so much damage the poison is just fashion
[1:18:44] <%Fooguwu> Very Gauntlet to me
[1:18:46] <+MrBaldachin> nah it's more Qarn
[1:18:51] <@SSaryn> It's the grass and shit, has similar patterns.
[1:19:02] <+MrBaldachin> specifically Qarn (Hard)
[1:19:36] <%Skelefellah> Getting some Qitana Ravel vibes, too

[1:22:52] <%californaya> oh hey, this is a Focus game, they seem to have good taste in games to publish
[1:23:03] <@SSaryn> BTW, can confirm, the PC version of Dead Gods is legit fantastic now and has everything I've been wanting with this patch.
[1:23:28] <%aWanderingKaivo> oh was that the cthulhu game
[1:23:35] <%dekkitout> Aeon Must Die, man that game looked dope
[1:23:36] <Gutsandlove> ion must die?
[1:23:38] <%ironohki> Hades 2 is out already?
[1:23:43] <Saltmeisterr> i know the game but not the name
[1:23:51] <Saltmeisterr> @Gutsandlove thats it
[1:24:04] <@SSaryn> @dekkitout That was due to higher ups in Dev doing bullshit to be fair.
[1:24:10] <%aWanderingKaivo> oh I am thinking of the OTHER dev-publisher kerfuffle
[1:24:12] <Gutsandlove> no no,AEON must die

[1:26:03] <richy99969> is the new update live ?
[1:26:22] <@SSaryn> They're meant to, don't worry.
[1:26:25] <@SSaryn> @richy99969 Ye.
[1:26:30] <+Dotta5> went back to his home on Jabroney Street
[1:26:38] <richy99969> cool
[1:26:47] <richy99969> i suck big hairy nuts at this game , any tips ?
[1:26:59] <%ironohki> Manscaped?
[1:26:59] <%dekkitout> Power of gun?
[1:27:12] <serkiimouse> Gun restores health
[1:27:25] <@SSaryn> @richy99969 Learn patterns, scaling is always nice to get.
[1:27:25] <%dekkitout> Gun god demands blood
[1:27:37] <richy99969> i hate the stamina mechanic in this game cause it makes you too slow
[1:28:07] <serkiimouse> He was on fire
[1:28:08] <LoneFonte> fire damage?
[1:28:09] <@Moobot> Hey check out Curse of the Dead Gods here! It got a big update and it's on sale! https://bit.ly/329oaPc
[1:28:10] <@SSaryn> @richy99969 Recommendation would be to get the perk where your Perfect Parries give you full stamina then
[1:28:11] <richy99969> im used to the hades stamina mechanic
[1:28:12] <serkiimouse> If I had to guess
[1:28:21] <@SSaryn> Or even Greed Kills giving you one more stamina on kill.
[1:28:28] <richy99969> thanks @SSaryn
[1:29:45] <%aWanderingKaivo> its canadian 2% so its in a bag
[1:29:49] <@SSaryn> Little bit.
[1:30:05] <vilecrois> that's just Bleep doing its job
[1:30:06] <%ironohki> Pat is very smart.
[1:30:06] <%Fooguwu> brain room
[1:30:10] <LoneFonte> no prob
[1:30:11] <iosephe> It's late, I get it
[1:30:11] <%samazonsky> Don't worry, Pat. Why we love ya.
[1:30:12] <%YakumoYomi> No worries, Patty Cakes
[1:30:12] <richy99969> its ok if you have speech problems my little brother does too
[1:30:14] <%Ranryu692> I haven't noticed a difference
[1:30:16] <%LeiaSkynoober> You're fine, it's funny!
[1:30:16] <richy99969> theres help for that
[1:30:23] <@SSaryn> All that Rick and Morty you're watching I see
[1:30:27] <serkiimouse> Is your head going to explode scanners style?
[1:30:28] <%SirGO0SE> LUL
[1:30:33] <%samazonsky> Pull up a chable, don't worry about it
[1:30:34] <tanarath> Pat has a universe brain right now.
[1:30:39] <%ironohki> Rick and Morty makes you smarter.
[1:30:44] <+SteinsApprentice> Pshhhh Lp tax never left
[1:30:48] <%Fooguwu> i say embrace it fully
[1:30:52] <%weissguard> I mean, at least the stream is pretty chill?
[1:31:13] <richy99969> im kinda dumb cause some rick and morty episodes i have to watch twice to understand
[1:31:25] <@SSaryn> Idk what it is about Dead Gods but yeah, this feels like semi-ASMR to me.
[1:31:39] <@SSaryn> Remember you can reroll.
[1:31:44] <%californaya> does this have co-op?
[1:31:45] <%samazonsky> Dead God ASMR....
[1:32:01] <@SSaryn> I know right, the amount of rerolls you have is near your Gold.
[1:32:02] <%californaya> this extremely feels like something I would play with friends while Outriders is on fire
[1:32:20] <%californaya> yes
[1:32:20] <@SSaryn> You mean every day?
[1:32:24] <@SSaryn> Literally every day?
[1:32:26] <serkiimouse> lmao
[1:32:36] <HeroToxiko> good
[1:32:36] <%dekkitout> All day, err day
[1:32:42] <richy99969> outriders is dying down isnt it
[1:32:44] <%californaya> I have been waiting for it to get to a mild smoulder before jumping in
[1:32:44] <RWLJr98> Outriders < Division tbh
[1:32:47] <RWLJr98> imo
[1:32:52] <DianaTheAscian> idk why people still care about outriders at this point
[1:33:01] <iosephe> they should've made it entirely clientside
[1:33:07] <%samazonsky> Several Craps and a Poo for good measure.
[1:33:07] <richy99969> maybe it will be good in about a year
[1:33:11] <%californaya> because it's on Game Pass, lol
[1:33:17] <%californaya> that's the only reason I touched it
[1:33:18] <@SSaryn> Outriders is slowly killing itself due to how technically fucked it is. If no one can play it, then no one's gonna want to after either.
[1:33:22] <%YakumoYomi> Not nearly as many people playing
[1:33:28] <+ReallyBigRocks> Yeah that's rough
[1:33:33] <doc_ock_rokc> I felt like Outriders was gonna be fucked and I was right
[1:33:50] <richy99969> at least its not as bad as anthem
[1:33:50] <%ironohki> I'm waiting for Outriders to stabilize before I get in. Hopefully it does stabilize eventually.
[1:34:11] <%aWanderingKaivo> oh is that god offer on drops a new mechanic? I don't remember that
[1:34:12] <JonnyJug> At least Dead Gods doesn't have always online
[1:34:15] <%YakumoYomi> No idea why the forced the always-online for singleplayer, but it's certainly biting them in the ass
[1:34:17] <amonimis> I got my fill with remnant from the ashes tbh
[1:34:19] <%ironohki> Pat, please say Outriders will never stabilize, so crazy talk makes it good.
[1:34:25] <@SSaryn> @ironohki At this point I have no hope. It'll be a year at most before servers are even close to stable only because of how little people are gonna be playing it.
[1:34:51] <%MelBrooksKA> Well I'm off, have a good night Pat, hope your migraine gets better
[1:34:53] <%lordvulkan1> lordvulkan1 subscribed at Tier 1.

[1:49:57] <@Moobot> Hey check out Curse of the Dead Gods here! It got a big update and it's on sale! https://bit.ly/329oaPc
[1:50:22] <+The_Devil_Breaker> How related to Darkest Dungeon is this game?
[1:50:27] <richy99969> i wish i was the cat so i could get some hugs from him
[1:50:32] <moopycat> it takes two to make a thing go right, it takes two to make it outta sight?
[1:50:34] <%ironohki> "I egg"
[1:50:38] <@SSaryn> @The_Devil_Breaker Not much but it's got some DNA for sure.
[1:50:48] <%shurtal> Your microfibre towel appears to have grown legs and a tail
[1:52:04] <%shurtal> BORK
[1:52:07] <%aWanderingKaivo> I know that feel
[1:52:07] <+Euphbugg> LUL
[1:52:21] <Talen99> Oh gosh this is one of those roguelikes where your health just never naturally regens, like Noita
[1:52:35] <%ironohki> psaBlep psaBlep psaBlep psaBlep psaBlep
[1:52:49] <%aWanderingKaivo> you can get some items to regen on kill and stuff like that. but not innately afaik, no
[1:53:02] <%aWanderingKaivo> plus there are healing rooms some times
[1:53:06] <@SSaryn> @Talen99 So much so, you have to dedicate a perk slot to actually get a good amount of health back from bosses.
[1:53:11] <tanarath> it does regen via special abilities and health shrines @talen99
[1:53:32] <Talen99> he needs a cautious slug haha got em
[1:53:39] <lloyddboy> LUL
[1:53:40] <@SSaryn> There's definitely some cool bloodlust builds though.
[1:53:44] <Louie_Salmon> God you're a mess
[1:53:54] <%heyitsbrian> Pat, I just jumped into the chat and I'm so confused.  How is this a Dead Cells thing?  This looks like a diablo.
[1:54:11] <Talen99> yeah how is this dead cells
[1:54:15] <@SSaryn> @heyitsbrian Collab thing with them, along with new stuff.
[1:54:17] <Talen99> is he meming?
[1:54:22] <+TheBitingIrish> It got a crossover
[1:54:29] <@SSaryn> !curse
[1:54:29] <@Moobot> Hey check out Curse of the Dead Gods here! It got a big update and it's on sale! https://bit.ly/329oaPc
[1:54:32] <%Ranryu692> @heyitsbrian they're doing a cross-promotion with Dead Cells. the sword is in the game and stuff
[1:54:33] <@SSaryn> New stuff there.
[1:54:34] <Talen99> cool
[1:55:13] <+TheBitingIrish> Does Gief still try to shag Elmo? LUL
[1:55:19] <%heyitsbrian> @SSaryn @Ranryu692  is this just a Dead Cells diablo then?
[1:55:45] <%heyitsbrian> onboard either way
[1:55:52] <%heyitsbrian> Dead Cells is rad
[1:55:57] <@SSaryn> @heyitsbrian Kind of..? It's definitely got its' own identity to it.
[1:56:02] <%aWanderingKaivo> well in the sense of isometric and roguelike I suppose
[1:56:04] <Talen99> This is Dead Diablo Cells
[1:56:04] <DSD24> Level 1, 2, 3, and DIE
[1:56:11] <Talen99> This is Darkest Hades
[1:56:12] <tanarath> Reroll?
[1:56:31] <%dekkitout> psaSkelmo
[1:56:32] <@SSaryn> No it doesn't, you get brand new stuff, just got unlucky.
[1:56:33] <%AzureGale> LUL
[1:56:40] <%ironohki> This is definitely Darkest Hades.
[1:56:52] <%aWanderingKaivo> wait I didn't pay attention what is this weapon
[1:57:05] <%Fooguwu> you said that like squeezy jibs
[1:57:31] <%Ranryu692> @heyitsbrian it's a rogue-lite
[1:57:33] <%shurtal> "Not my purple jerkin' hand!"
[1:57:34] <Talen99> It's a sick throwing knife
[1:57:40] <%aWanderingKaivo> we got throwing mesoamerican shurikens now?
[1:57:53] <%aWanderingKaivo> yeah rogue lite I should say
[1:58:04] <chhdez> Shurikentzintles
[1:58:04] <@SSaryn> Try doing one-two with your throwing stars too, as long as you're not doing your finisher, it won't cost stamina.
[1:58:05] <@Moobot> Hey check out Curse of the Dead Gods here! It got a big update and it's on sale! https://bit.ly/329oaPc
[1:58:21] <Talen99> oh man if there's one thing I learned about the mesoamericans in school it's their fondness for fucking shurikens
[1:58:30] <%ironohki> I know the difference between a roguelike and a roguelite, but saying "roguelite" makes me feel like the biggest most pretentious hipster asshole.
[1:58:34] <RyuuAoi> Bless you, Pat.
[1:58:44] <chhdez> Obsidian shurikens, even
[1:59:25] <@SSaryn> Also thank god they improved Throwing stars base stats, they were kinda poopoo before.
[1:59:25] <%heyitsbrian> @Ranryu692 Thanks for clearing that up lol
[1:59:29] <lloyddboy> does this game have any timer-exclusive bonuses like ded cells with the timed doors?
[1:59:36] <@SSaryn> CHAD MACE
[1:59:40] <%aWanderingKaivo> they are looking pretty good right now
[1:59:45] <%Ranryu692> @heyitsbrian no problem, happy to help
[1:59:56] <%aWanderingKaivo> BERZERKER MACE
[2:00:19] <%dekkitout> That mace is perfect for fuckups like me
[2:00:29] <%aWanderingKaivo> red tearstone mace
[2:00:39] <@SSaryn> Just equals more damage, ez.
[2:00:51] <+HuntingFreeman> Thats just more damage for the mace CoolCat
[2:01:14] <%aWanderingKaivo> it turns your fuckups into fuckdowns
[2:01:58] <%thedankestmeeme> so you get stronger when you get more cursed?
[2:02:06] <Talen99> UUUUUUWWAAAAAAAAAH
[2:02:19] <fkellington> Blursed
[2:02:25] <@SSaryn> @thedankestmeeme Depends, depends on the curse itself and the weapons you're using.
[2:02:36] <@SSaryn> No matter what though, usually don't want the Final Curse.
[2:02:46] <@SSaryn> USUALLY.
[2:03:15] <+TheBitingIrish> ooo
[2:03:23] <+HuntingFreeman> so you're getting that right?
[2:03:33] <+TheBitingIrish> Sacrifice dagger
[2:03:53] <tanarath> Universe brain
[2:03:56] <%aWanderingKaivo> the ultimate lazy play build, easier perfect shots and more damage on low life
[2:05:11] <%AzureGale> dog snor
[2:05:42] <Devbob98> I had no clue Pat was streaming
[2:05:52] <Talen99> It's Capra demon!
[2:06:00] <RyuuAoi> @devbob98 #BLESSED
[2:06:19] <%aWanderingKaivo> he was one of the original ones iirc yeah

[2:07:15] <%californaya> thank you for the stream, Mister Pat, I bought the game thanks to your hashtag influence
[2:07:22] <@SSaryn> Blood Sacrifices?
[2:07:23] <+TheBitingIrish> Why not replace the +3 CON thing???
[2:07:24] <vilecrois> sacrifices! :D
[2:07:25] <Mr_Rakjo> G U N S
[2:07:28] <%dekkitout> They didn't have guns?
[2:07:29] <%californaya> I go sleep now
[2:07:36] <iosephe> They didn't have guns
[2:07:41] <+Gespens> Cortez?
[2:07:42] <Oxybe> they failed to develop a flu vaccine??
[2:07:46] <DSD24> Disease?
[2:07:46] <%dekkitout> Horses?
[2:07:47] <Talen99> not one gun
[2:07:47] <Mr_Rakjo> Should have gotten guns
[2:07:48] <StrawberryLion> I thought you were going to say immunity.
[2:07:50] <fkellington> they didn't make chocolate edible?
[2:07:50] <@Moobot> Hey check out Curse of the Dead Gods here! It got a big update and it's on sale! https://bit.ly/329oaPc
[2:07:52] <%aWanderingKaivo> named henry fuckdown
[2:07:52] <ArcaneMusic> You mean the blood sacrifice?
[2:07:54] <%weissguard> Blood?
[2:07:54] <+SteinsApprentice> Apocalypto
[2:07:57] <Zourath> A desire for blankets?
[2:08:02] <Grennold> Human sacrifice?
[2:08:03] <Mr_Rakjo> nah thats cool pat
[2:08:05] <fojidoj> Spaniards?
[2:08:06] <tanarath> Poor people might experience blood sacrifice.
[2:08:07] <ArcaneMusic> Wow ALL of you went to the spanish hunh
[2:08:10] <Devbob98> The Spanish
[2:08:12] <%Ynkubus_> Pyramids neded stairlifts
[2:08:13] <Mr_Rakjo> how else are you gonna feed the sun god if not with blood
[2:08:19] <T_Sasquatch> One weird trick ! Doctors Hate IT
[2:08:22] <%solracc25> the plague
[2:08:30] <%dekkitout> What? Who's gonna make sure the sun'll come up? Gotta sacrifice man...
[2:08:32] <Grennold> But how else will you get good weather for the crops? Kappa
[2:08:33] <vile_brand> a desire to impress that one girl who friend-zoned them?
[2:08:33] <StrawberryLion> Shows how important it is to wash your sheets.
[2:08:33] <Oxybe> you can't have a decent society without breaking a few eggs
[2:08:39] <T_Sasquatch> That's why they were so advanced !
[2:08:41] <@SSaryn> But think about it, we wouldn't have all those cool contraptions without blood but oh wait they could have used any substance that was as thick as blood. Several of them.
[2:08:46] <Talen99> One weird trick to keep drought away!
[2:08:54] <RyuuAoi> @strawberrylion Oof
[2:09:07] <Oxybe> Shamans HATE it!
[2:09:10] <+coolthulhuu> blood in body good -> sun good -> sun got no blood -> give blood
[2:09:13] <+coolthulhuu> duh
[2:09:16] <%dekkitout> @Talen99 Conquistadors hate it!
[2:09:24] <Devbob98> Pat would‚Äôve been a Sacrifice guaranteed
[2:09:27] <Zourath> On the other hand, they made basketball but with blood sacrifices, so it's a mixed bad.
[2:09:34] <Talen99> hehehe
[2:09:34] <fkellington> What if blood sacrifice is secretly the one thing missing to advance our society?
[2:09:36] <+RatloreTheIdiot> people do be making light of smallpox blankets in here huh
[2:09:47] <StrawberryLion> He would of been a top tier sacrifice though.
[2:09:53] <+SteinsApprentice> Good parry damn
[2:09:59] <+RatloreTheIdiot> not even the aztecs that had that done to them
[2:10:09] <Talen99> Do we really not already work on blood sacrifices? let's be real
[2:10:21] <@SSaryn> BTW, depending on Rarity, upgrades can give you more perks for you weapons.
[2:10:31] <Talen99> HOW MUCH YOU PAY FOR THAT PHONE IN YO POCKET?!
[2:10:56] <RyuuAoi> @talen99 $349
[2:11:10] <@SSaryn> Booooo
[2:11:13] <Talen99> How much impoverished third world blood squeezed out in a sweatshop did it cost!
[2:11:17] <Zourath> But if we don't commit blood sacrifices, the rats might learn how to swim.
[2:11:42] <%ironohki> Strength Go Up
[2:11:45] <%ironohki> Unlock Time Stop
[2:11:53] <fkellington> imagine if all we had to do to unlock the secrets of cold fusion and plentiful room temperature superconductors is just a few people cut open on top of a big stepped pyramid
[2:12:04] <+TheBitingIrish> @PatStaresAt Can you offer dropped weapons to the gods?
[2:12:12] <@SSaryn> That might be too much juice.
[2:12:26] <%aWanderingKaivo> shadow word: pain
[2:12:34] <Talen99> I begrudgingly bought a Boost drink for lunch today and was like why does Nestle have to push orphans into the crusher
[2:12:34] <%rottingpastry> anything you've equipped can't be offered
[2:12:37] <tanarath> uh oh
[2:12:40] <fkellington> what platforms is this game on?
[2:12:47] <Devbob98> Pat kills god for big numbers
[2:13:03] <+HuntingFreeman> Juice for the Juice God
[2:13:04] <fkellington> never too much juice
[2:13:07] <%Ranryu692> you can never have too much juice
[2:13:13] <%Ascethetic> hows the head, Pat?
[2:13:21] <RyuuAoi> @fkellington Amen
[2:13:26] <%dekkitout> You got the juice now
[2:13:35] <RyuuAoi> @ascethetic No complaints yet.
[2:13:37] <Devbob98> @ascethetic It looks like he still has one

[2:25:06] <%Monkeyweed21> Pat you are engaged to a lizard snake person
[2:25:14] <Devbob98> Lamias are as fair as I can go
[2:25:19] <%AnIcedCoffee> LUL
[2:25:22] <@SSaryn> I mean, no damage taken above 10% of your max health is good.
[2:25:29] <$Dakuu75> are you 100% sure about that though?
[2:25:31] <doc_ock_rokc> Paige is more a bird person
[2:25:33] <%AnIcedCoffee> Paige is a gorgon
[2:25:44] <Devbob98> Have you checked?
[2:25:44] <%rottingpastry> from a single hit?
[2:25:48] <%ironohki> Snakes don't have red hair
[2:25:52] <%Monkeyweed21> birds are just unshaven lizards
[2:26:11] <@SSaryn> At most, he could have only taken 100 damage from any hit.
[2:26:14] <ArcaneMusic> Just because snakes are NATURALLY attracted to the aroma of mustard seeds does NOT mean that- Hol up
[2:26:15] <%rottingpastry> does pat fear fire?
[2:26:21] <Devbob98> Paige is most likely a muppet
[2:26:21] <%dekkitout> Just be careful if she unhinges her jaw, okay?
[2:26:29] <%aWanderingKaivo> or are lizards just naked birds
[2:26:35] <%weissguard> fire indeed hot
[2:26:42] <@SSaryn> Let's be real, if you're set on fire, shit sucks
[2:26:49] <%Mr_Pylon> fire bad
[2:26:49] <%Monkeyweed21> oh no Pat is a witch
[2:26:55] <pilllowofbees> did you know fire is hot?
[2:26:59] <+Euphbugg> can confirm, fire can be scary
[2:27:01] <%dekkitout> Having an acute incendiary allergy does blow
[2:27:02] <%Ranryu692> I just touched fire. It was fine
[2:27:12] <Devbob98> Pat do you fear thing that can kill you?
[2:27:16] <%rottingpastry> well, the game thinks pat fears fire
[2:27:22] <%AzureGale> Darkness!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!

[2:29:03] <@Moobot> Hey check out Curse of the Dead Gods here! It got a big update and it's on sale! https://bit.ly/329oaPc
[2:29:19] <Devbob98> @monkeyweed21 And people like me
[2:29:26] <@SSaryn> That and scaling damage is just incredible.
[2:29:54] <+TheMorilo> this game is so cool
[2:30:06] <%Ranryu692> is it called scaling damage because you're damaging the scaly snakes?
[2:30:13] <Oxybe> scales with the magic find stat too
[2:30:34] <RyuuAoi> You be safe out there, Pat! Take your box cutter.
[2:30:38] <@SSaryn> 39% damage at base with a Dagger will definitely do that.
[2:30:40] <%aWanderingKaivo> the core hit and kill effects in this game really are satisfying though
[2:30:42] <molens90> did you ever get him fixed? or is he still too young?
[2:30:50] <%rottingpastry> more shitzillions
[2:30:50] <WarchiefGoldva> This game has a tendency of kicking my ass.
[2:30:54] <pilllowofbees> the more snakes you have the more damage it do
[2:31:04] <tanarath> @molens90 too young
[2:31:05] <%AzureGale> no
[2:31:05] <@SSaryn> Please don't
[2:31:12] <%Piemen99> NO
[2:31:12] <%Ranryu692> don't taxidermy your dog's balls
[2:31:14] <+Euphbugg> yus
[2:31:14] <%Mr_Pylon> what, gonna taunt him with it?
[2:31:15] <%dekkitout> Why not bronze them?
[2:31:17] <%SirGO0SE> save them and hang them on the xmas tree :)
[2:31:25] <%shurtal> 30 more ball filled days
[2:31:25] <%weissguard> what if he gets into the jar somehow?
[2:31:28] <Devbob98> Poor bastard, he‚Äôs not ready
[2:31:29] <%Piemen99> HE'LL TRY TO TP GET TO IT AND EAT IT
[2:31:32] <PinoProxie> put them in a jar and make it the brb screen
[2:31:33] <lloyddboy> one month until DOG NUT DEFEATED
[2:31:38] <%Monkeyweed21> Will Gief be freezing some of his sperm in case he wants kids?
[2:31:51] <RyuuAoi> Let him fuck
[2:32:05] <%rottingpastry> more shitzillions
[2:32:12] <molens90> that dog nut could be worth a lot.

[2:33:21] <%aWanderingKaivo> that seems strong
[2:33:21] <@SSaryn> But Dagger.
[2:33:24] <@SSaryn> Nah dude
[2:33:25] <@SSaryn> Dagger.
[2:33:28] <pilllowofbees> its a gun
[2:33:29] <@SSaryn> Trust me.
[2:33:32] <WarchiefGoldva> That seems good, but dagger.
[2:33:36] <%rottingpastry> you invested a lot in that dagger
[2:33:37] <+Euphbugg> Dagger is cool guy
[2:33:46] <doc_ock_rokc> Dagger is the right choise
[2:33:47] <%AzureGale> Good dagger
[2:33:58] <@SSaryn> Reaper is pretty pog but Ceremonial upgraded that huge is huge big huge
[2:34:00] <Devbob98> But gun is gun
[2:34:18] <%AzureGale> It means do good greed streak or die
[2:34:25] <Oxybe> dagger is good guy. he tips the waiter big numbers.
[2:34:33] <%dekkitout> The toll is your weight in gold- or blood
[2:34:43] <@SSaryn> @Oxybe Mhmm mhmm, tips 20% minimum.
[2:34:55] <%SaiyanShoto> do combo
[2:34:55] <WarchiefGoldva> This combo actually saved my ass on a few runs.
[2:35:24] <pilllowofbees> who  needs to avoid traps when face tanking is optimal
[2:35:30] <%aWanderingKaivo> don't let those rude walls stab you like that
