[0:32:29] <$realm_forge> Snaoe kills dumbledore
[0:32:31] <Spudnacious_Dynasty> Attack on Titan should have been on the moon of Saturn, Titan.
[0:32:31] <Tennochief> This is why you should always read the manga
[0:32:32] <munitalprats> AoT poopy, good music.
[0:32:32] <+skm742> uhhh, there big guys? (I've never watched AoT)

[0:32:38] <+BusterRepukken> you'd use pocket sand
[0:32:41] <%KeiganOfAstora> just fucking stop even joking about AOT

[0:34:21] <+glgzephyr> YEAH YEAH YEAH
[0:34:22] <Octocon> so now WE are paying for your skins 4Head
[0:34:24] <%SirGO0SE> based
[0:34:25] <%demiiluna> good answer
[0:34:26] <%Dementedpenguin> Fair.
[0:34:28] <%ExpressNode> Oh Shining Force :(
[0:34:28] <+glgzephyr> THAT'S THE REAL SHIT
[0:34:28] <%rumtumtugnutz> That's a terrible idea.
[0:34:31] <%asgard147> limesThink That could work
[0:34:32] <%MisterRockett> Those Shining GBA games were legit and made by GRASSHOPPER
[0:34:44] <s1rcuit> the problem with monkey's paw is that it'll change into something you don't want
[0:34:46] <%rumtumtugnutz> Shining Force as a strategy RPG would be cool
[0:34:47] <+AmanisHouseOfNonsense> That's the right answer
[0:34:53] <+glgzephyr> I only ever played Shining Force 1 LUL
[0:34:57] <%Monkeyweed21> I would sacrifice Legacy of Kain so that Nosgoth could be a success
[0:34:59] <crowspeak> I'd sacrifice Bioshock Infinite for Bioshock Turn Based RPG
[0:35:01] <%rumtumtugnutz> But a Pokemon MMo would be terrible.
[0:35:02] <%ExpressNode> Now its a Tales anime ripoff
[0:35:02] <CanadianAnimatorGuy> Sacrifice Halo for Balo or whatever
[0:35:04] <%UltraViolet371> I'd cancel Silent Hill to get Silent Hill Pachinko
[0:35:04] <+lucaflowe> Wait the GBA Shining games were good tho
[0:35:04] <%asgard147> Have they ever re-released them?
[0:35:13] <%NovaKnightmare> Sacrifice Fifa to get a narrative Soccer  RPG
[0:35:15] <+ArtsyFoxo> Shining Force is lit but mann.... I wanted Shining Soul
[0:35:17] <%YakumoYomi> I'm glad you specified "After the Saturn", because Shining the Holy Ark is pretty rad (even if it isn't as good as Shining Force)
[0:35:18] <+wizard_of_diamonds> How so?
[0:35:18] <%Persona_EX> For as much as you talk about it I’m surprised you haven’t played 1 and 2 on stream?
[0:35:19] <+LowBatteryLife> Headbanging to the circus tent theme to this day
[0:35:19] <%valriot> 3Hs??
[0:35:19] <+xerioes> id kill all of xenogears after 1 , to get a character action xenogears
[0:35:20] <%Mr_Pylon> Kill the NHL EA series and give me Hockey Team Manager
[0:35:21] <+glgzephyr> dude SF was light years ahead of FE as a contemporary
[0:35:21] <DiagunAquila> what about waifus, is it better at that?
[0:35:34] <+BusterRepukken> what do you think of all the Sony news today? They're acting like a bunch of asses IMO.
[0:35:36] <%demiiluna> @crowspeak You mean like Fallout 1 & 2 style or what
[0:35:38] <munitalprats> those all sound like negatives
[0:35:39] <+glgzephyr> imagine a Shining Force game with Three Houses QoL
[0:35:42] <VentWilsn> future stream?

[0:35:45] <%ace_cfa44> I want to sacrifice something for a front mission 3 remaster
[0:35:49] <munitalprats> Open worls suck bro
[0:35:53] <CanadianAnimatorGuy> and you can win things by watching!
[0:35:56] <%iErik4> Hey Pat, how about that High Res UI elements coming to FF14 on Tuesday
[0:35:56] <Profmcstevie> Stream it and SHOW US
[0:35:58] <%HiroTSK5> Echoes doesn't go that far but it has towns and dungeons
[0:36:00] <+thickshield> can i just sacrifice kojima for a new ZoE? that sounds fair
[0:36:06] <%JoshManVGH> That sounds way better than daily life management.
[0:36:08] <Enemy_In_Disguise> Kill FGO to get a Fate Arcsys Fighting Game
[0:36:08] <%BoxNavy> yeah shadows of valentia is kiiiiinda that
[0:36:10] <%MisterRockett> I think I always got Shining and Phantasy star mixed up as the big Genises JRPGs.

[0:36:14] <+Delenay> maybe well get another one from the octo/triangle team
[0:36:20] <%rumtumtugnutz> I would personally sacrifice Destiny so nobody had to play Destiny.
[0:36:21] <+Delenay> square force
[0:36:22] <%BigCoffee> grinding in shining force was bad, but it rocked
[0:36:22] <+Vampireinarm> Shining Force ran so Fire Emblem could walk

[0:46:03] <%KeiganOfAstora> 76 of 100?
[0:46:06] <%linSP> the only thing that eases the FOMO is them bringing back old skins you mightve missed out on

[0:46:14] <+Aldurin_> that sick reaction speed from that rando, though
[0:46:17] <%KeiganOfAstora> It's easy to max the BP in Apex too if you play a lot
[0:46:19] <%AlteisenReiseZ> Cheer500 Pat, the whole phenomenon of being mean in your head, but still being a good person is called "void thoughts" they occur regularly, I.E. throwing your phone out of the window, dropkicking a newborn, pushing over an elderly lady and so on
[0:46:20] <rufus2k2> oh no I am being shot, better just stand there and not take cover!
[0:46:24] <dragonlemon234> any victories yet?

[0:47:17] <%linSP> its kill or be killed, child
[0:47:19] <+BigHooppaw> But what if they are strong children?
[0:47:19] <%MelBrooksKA> You could say that about any game tho
[0:47:20] <%SirGO0SE> yeah hammer that meat
[0:47:20] <+BusterRepukken> the previous season, the Map changed with the seasons
[0:47:21] <+tigerfang86> and so they also will never be cool
[0:47:22] <%Higure_yoru> no winning only shame in fortnite
[0:47:24] <CanadianAnimatorGuy> "I was getting head from my girlfriend, whatever"
[0:47:24] <%Skelefellah> Imagine dying to children. Imagine winning against children. THE CHILDREN, PAT.

[0:47:46] <%asgard147> Cool stinky or just regular stinky? limesThink
[0:47:47] <DickieWoodsmall_279> the only winning move is to hide your fortnite habit from everyone
[0:47:48] <Azathotic> Imagine dying to a child and the child is Zangeif
[0:47:49] <%valriot> Makes you play MH World and be bored
[0:47:49] <%ExpressNode> I'm gonna go to the store and get me some dark chocolate

[0:48:15] <Octocon> LUL'
[0:48:15] <%MisterRockett> It makes it so the animals don't attack you/run away so they're easier to tame. I THINK it also makes you more silent as well.
[0:48:17] <Octocon> LUL
[0:48:21] <dapperskeleton69> CHILD DOMINATED

[0:48:43] <%MisterRockett> Hunter's Cloak and then you walk up to them and hold square.
[0:48:48] <+bustawof> nope just hold square next to them
[0:48:57] <HollowBeansVG> you just press the tame button
[0:49:04] <munitalprats> well, why get cloak when you can craft into guns?
[0:49:05] <DickieWoodsmall_279> this game is perfect for you pat, all you do in it is kill children and robots
[0:49:06] <%Skelefellah> Man got them pheromone stank on em.
[0:49:08] <ogmabb> why tame animals when you can crank 90's on kids
[0:49:10] <+VexicBayn> I didn't know the stink cloak even dropped
[0:49:12] <%Tuna_Can_0> play soccer :)
[0:49:15] <%MisterRockett> I saw ONE person with a tamed animal and it was in the match where I finally managed to do it.

[0:51:19] <%NovaKnightmare> uh oh stinky
[0:51:20] <%MisterRockett> @DickieWoodsmall_279 I recently remembered that the entire reason I was excited for the original Fortnite as advertised was because of that thicc girl who's not in the mode everyone plays because the bigger model would give her a bigger hitbox and thus easier to shoot.
[0:51:22] <%Skelefellah> Yeah. Flatulent speed.
[0:51:26] <@SpaceCapnCrone> I love Jordan Mimeograph

[1:19:37] <Devbob98> It’s all we got, what else you want

[1:22:59] <DamonDropkick> florida is the silent hill of america
[1:23:00] <%patriotrenegade> @PatStaresAt Its a poorly constructed data matrix, police cars constantly clip into the surface
[1:23:02] <+tweedler92> Florida only exsists in JoJo
[1:23:02] <%KeiganOfAstora> We ignore it
[1:23:03] <%AzureGale> Unfortunately yes
[1:23:07] <+bustawof> florida has been rejected by all other states
[1:23:08] <EynosStyles> it's the place we convince the old people to go
[1:23:10] <+LowBatteryLife> Florida is a lie we told to god to act as a lightning rod for hurricanes
[1:23:13] <Hericknhx> I think Florida is real because gattors have to come from some place

[1:23:16] <$realm_forge> Florida is madd max with more old people and leftover neon signs
[1:23:21] <%KeiganOfAstora> Godzilla destroyed Pensacola so that's cool
[1:23:21] <%Skelefellah> Florida is a very large dumpster ever-on-fire on the southern coast of Georgia - some folks believe it to be a state, but it's just a landmark if anything.
[1:23:22] <+EdenOfLove> Florida Man Catches Shark That Bit Him, Pledges to Eat It.

[1:23:57] <%AzureGale> Rifles are rad
[1:24:09] <%linSP> florida is the pvp enabled zone
[1:24:11] <%NoHoldsBarredProductions> Florida is the state where the governor is on such a level of corruption that he declared pro wrestling "essential to Florida's economy" just so Linda McMahon's SuperPAC would cut him a cheque for $18 million for "advertising".

[1:24:41] <starpIatinumb> gianni tapping into crazy talk?
[1:24:47] <%patriotrenegade> @PatStaresAt You hear about the radioactive lake thats leaking into the groundwater and threatening to break its levee and destroy 300 homes in Florida
[1:24:48] <Phrickshun> I prefer to pretend Florida and most of the middle of america doesn't exist
[1:24:54] <$RealThiele> sure are
[1:25:04] <%shurtal> say this about Florida, they have VERY permisivie records laws, which is why everyone hears about weird shit going donw there, cause you can just ASK the Florida Gov. : Yo, what fucked up thing happened today, and the news outlets fucking RAN with it
[1:25:16] <televisedrevolting> Is Georgia a buffer state to the illusion that is Florida?

[1:34:37] <nevan_44> LUL
[1:34:38] <+BusterRepukken> Things become popular for a reason sometimes.
[1:34:38] <%MechArch> its asmr
[1:34:39] <%king_wragles> Niche streamers doing mainstream stuff is arguably niche itself
[1:34:43] <$RealThiele> continuous bit
[1:34:43] <%ioriac> I actively dislike half of pop culture
[1:34:43] <%barrakuta371> Can't wait for Pat to spite play Halo only to then actually enjoy it
[1:34:44] <+shad8snake> very committed to the bit
[1:34:44] <tsund3> THE BIT NEVER ENDS

[1:34:44] <+traximus_s> fortnite came out at the right time

[1:34:48] <+BigBruthaThunda> get a concussion you coward
[1:34:48] <+Massimoman64> its probably because the typical personalities that play these games are a lot different from yours
[1:34:48] <+ChaosedStar> and damn you pat for making me want to spend money for raven...
[1:34:49] <Shastafield> popular things are usually popular for reasons
[1:34:49] <+archangel9889> you gota commit to the bit
[1:34:49] <KosOrSomeSayKosm_> can't tell if pat is a good fortnite influencer of if I'm easily influenced
[1:34:50] <%NoHoldsBarredProductions> Does that make Paige Carrie Underwood?
[1:34:50] <crowspeak> The game looks really fun honestly
[1:34:55] <%ssjklyco> You joined Fortnite in a way that is still ON BRAND for you.
[1:34:57] <%BigDumBeak> pats very chatty during fortnite so its become fun
[1:34:59] <$floralkami> !uptime
[1:34:59] <@Moobot> I've been playing this game for how long? Oh only 1h 35m.
[1:35:02] <B1g_train> worked yourself into a shoot
[1:35:04] <%xcompleasedad> I mean, I stopped thinking it was a "bit" when you played it the third time.
[1:35:05] <DickieWoodsmall_279> i love fortnite and overwatch and halo fight me
[1:35:05] <isnotavampire> I spent several streams taunting Gianni about it, installed it, realised the contagion had spread
[1:35:08] <+traximus_s> when there was nothing to play
[1:35:09] <%Nuclearcherries> I've been listening to your opinions since I was a young teen, so yeah.
[1:35:09] <@SoFarFetched> well now you cursed it

[1:35:14] <DianaTheAscian> Thats gonna happen
[1:35:18] <bob900000> like destiny
[1:35:18] <+silentblast93> although pat cold war now has a bug that perma bans players if it occurs and activision it saying it dosent exist
[1:35:31] <%SirGO0SE> SnapShotKing PogChamp
[1:35:32] <%ioriac> pat becomes a season elitist
[1:35:34] <@SoFarFetched> last thing you played a bit of on stream was Warzone
[1:35:36] <+RenoDeGeneric> There's a lot of downtime for discussion but very exciting moments to stay interested
[1:35:36] <karovus> i hate how much i enjoy the fortnite fridays but these have been fun
[1:35:45] <%radregice> i bet woolie is excited for competitive fortnite talk on the podcast
[1:35:53] <@SoFarFetched> Fortnite seems to be that guilty pleasure for people.
[1:36:07] <+b1eed_> my fortnite streamer <3
[1:36:09] <DickieWoodsmall_279> @radregice we all know how much woolie loves the popular thing
[1:36:20] <bob900000> I wonder what would convince woolie to play fortnite?
[1:36:32] <+swid_harry> I used to play alot of Team Fortress 2 and Fortnite is the only shooter since that I have gotten really into
[1:36:34] <+vitoxxi> vergil skin
[1:36:36] <Devbob98> Gianni just rushing in
[1:36:37] <Hericknhx> seeing a red ball playing the zoomer game makes me happy 4Head

[1:36:39] <%AzureGale> ded
[1:36:45] <%linSP> that was a very sweaty player
[1:36:49] <intestinal_bleeding> they're doing the fornite thing!
[1:36:50] <entity42o> honestly i think I'm one of the last people to be kinda good at fortnite and not be a complete toxic dickhead on twitter lol
[1:36:51] <dapperskeleton69> @swid_harry aw man, when did you hop off the tf2 train?
[1:36:52] <%Boxortoo> You tried nagClap
[1:36:58] <RorenXBOX> ive asked you to play fortnite with me patrick and youve denied me once again, is this because you're jealous of my status as the #1 fortnite player in the world
[1:37:00] <%Skelefellah> @SoFarFetched Fortnite strikes me as that game a group of people play, but no one wants to talk about it to each other, despite having that common ground. Because of that, no one plays together or anything
[1:37:00] <munitalprats> LOOK AT THESE LOSERS
[1:37:00] <+Stormzcales_Lair> virgil and rock howard
[1:37:01] <T_Sasquatch> did you see how fast that build was
[1:37:05] <%Skelefellah> For fear of playing the 'babby game'
[1:37:09] <+BusterRepukken> I love it when your kills decide to build the Spencer Mansion from RE1 around them
[1:37:13] <tsund3> i think that was what turned me off of fortnite, people getting shot once and building the entire eiffel tower
[1:37:13] <%ioriac> Good lord he's still wearing his pjs pat
[1:37:14] <%blistexthief> Look at this tetris mans
[1:37:21] <+Raspada_Ryner> I honestly can't grasp how to build well
[1:37:22] <Devbob98> Jesus this build
[1:37:22] <+chiazam> Fortnite Friday’s with guests seems like the best place this big could go
[1:37:24] <DickieWoodsmall_279> @SoFarFetched what's so guilty about liking a thing that is good? jerking it to inceset porn is a guilty pleasure.
[1:37:27] <%barrakuta371> These last few minuted of a match why I stopped playing
[1:37:35] <%linSP> imagine some kids still playing with bots
[1:37:37] <%extradopeness> I have that Hall and Oates song in my head now
[1:37:48] <+swid_harry> @dapperskeleton69 like around 2016 before Overwatch came out. Played it alot for about 4 years
[1:37:51] <%SirGO0SE> an actual child now*
[1:38:21] <@SoFarFetched> @DickieWoodsmall_279 tends to be people who don't wanna be judged for liking certain things that are normal geefShrug they get worried about what people will think about them. Even though its usually overthinking.
[1:38:25] <+kewlmyc> If you have multiple devices, you can go back to fighting bots via a work around. Makes getting some of the challenges easier.
[1:38:35] <@SoFarFetched> But you know its ,hey if its something simple like this,just enjoy it and dont worry what o thers thing.
[1:38:36] <%patriotrenegade> THE ONE SHOT KILL
[1:38:41] <@SoFarFetched> think*
[1:38:42] <LucentWulf> yeah my first 6 matches of fortnite were all victory royales, and over the like 30 or so matches after that, have only won once
[1:38:43] <%Skelefellah> Yeah, that seems about right.
[1:38:44] <+Ches_Neckbeard> holy shit was DoD Source so bad
[1:39:00] <%Skelefellah> POPPED EM
[1:39:02] <+BusterRepukken> that raven glider is so cool

[1:41:23] <NOBLExGAMER> It's cool to see Pat playing with Tomar
[1:41:23] <DickieWoodsmall_279> @generalve input-based matchmaking might be putting you with more mkb players where the skill ceiling is higher
[1:41:25] <+BusterRepukken> the fortnite version of Raven is actually nice, they have the classic version of her too though
[1:41:28] <generalve> VENOM

[1:47:04] <%GarbageQueenEllie> Garbage Branding
[1:47:06] <NOBLExGAMER> Is the $40 for Master Chief Canadian Funny Money translation issues because in the US he's $20
[1:47:10] <dirtyh4rr1> I think it's a lot more than 5% that gets off to pat
[1:47:11] <%BigDumBeak> trashsona<3

[1:54:07] <Devbob98> It would’ve solved the slade situation real quick
[1:54:07] <%GarbageQueenEllie> Kratos would be the BIGGEST gun enthusiast ever

[1:54:23] <%AncelDeLambert> Pat: "You know what, I will take the magnum"
[1:54:25] <scrumbotime> kratos would hold three guns, one in each hand and one on his rager at the fightpower of a gun
[1:54:28] <%the22cstomp> BOI get me a fucking chaingun
[1:54:28] <%AlteisenReiseZ> Pat, pick up a minigun, then you'll be..... VULCAN RAVEN.

[1:54:50] <glue_huffington> "I must return home." (SPAS-12 cocking sound)
[1:54:51] <%Agami23> i was gonna make a joke about kratos with a gun but actually its too topical

[1:55:22] <Shardlab> Kratos fully acknowledging how shit he was and owning it
[1:55:24] <Devbob98> The new kratos is so much better
[1:55:30] <Meltgar> Did kratos had a friend that didn't betray him?
[1:55:36] <%GarbageQueenEllie> I mean it's not like he was sorry, he's just too tired to continue to be in denial
[1:55:41] <T_Sasquatch> I think nu-GOW is great but the combat doesnt feel good enough
[1:55:41] <%solracc25> tired dad Kratos

[1:55:49] <%cvp5127> not aphrodite tho LUL
[1:55:51] <%StaceMcGate> So here's my realization: Fortnite is the chillest content Pat has produced in awhile and Fortnite Friday has turned into his mini-podcast where he isn't a contrarian
[1:56:05] <Devbob98> It’s a good reflection of Greek tales
[1:56:06] <T_Sasquatch> also GOW3 on normal is so fucking hard , what the hell

[1:56:27] <Shardlab> @Meltgar His most ardent worshiper from Sparta. If they weren't fighting each other in the dark, Kratos wouldn't have hurt him and vice versa

[1:56:33] <Devbob98> He knew he did it, just didn’t care
[1:56:34] <%hrbeck_> "Who did this?"

[1:59:05] <+walt_chocolate> it was an adult
[1:59:21] <+walt_chocolate> could be a bot as well
[1:59:28] <CanadianAnimatorGuy> Reuben was 100% the opposite
[1:59:30] <%AzureGale> Or Keifer Sutherland
[1:59:32] <fairore> lol
[1:59:39] <%AncelDeLambert> it'd be nice to have a competent audio studio for VA to work in for a game, instead of... not
[1:59:40] <+BusterRepukken> Reuben tried to get Dan to stop
[1:59:43] <NOBLExGAMER> @walt_chocolate 100% it was a robit
[1:59:44] <PinoProxie> Rueben was ready to murder Dan
[1:59:46] <+walt_chocolate> lol
[1:59:48] <Zeif00> Reuben is wild
[1:59:49] <%the22cstomp> you really cant replace the voice of cergil
[1:59:55] <%StaceMcGate> Reuben silenced Dan before he went too far
[2:00:00] <isnotavampire> the "ND" in Non Disclosure Agreement is silent
[2:00:07] <Devbob98> Disney will fuck you up

[2:00:35] <%TallPixels> if kevin conroy leaks your batman game what are you gonna do? fire batman?
[2:00:44] <marvel877> They lean into his spoilers with Tom Holland.
[2:00:44] <Devbob98> Or mark ruffalo spoiler infinity war
[2:00:45] <DickieWoodsmall_279> fans love the VAs so firing them is just bad PR
[2:00:48] <%AzureGale> Weren't there some Fire Emblem: Three Houses VAs that got replaced because they revealed their roles too early
[2:00:58] <nevan_44> LUL
[2:01:05] <marvel877> @AzureGale yeah.
[2:01:06] <+walt_chocolate> @noblexgamer yeah, they put them in the game to make you feel like a big boi Kappa Kappa
[2:01:14] <NOBLExGAMER> @AzureGale Yeah Edlegard
[2:01:16] <Truxton_II> I still remember when Jon St. John tweeted that recorded lines for Valve for DOTA and people were like "WHAT!?"
[2:01:16] <%Nuclearcherries> @AzureGale It was Chris Niosi! It also didn't help that he was a creep
[2:01:17] <+megaman_sentinel> someone save the children
[2:01:18] <lloyddboy> HimVO
[2:01:18] <violet_paladin> pat: proceeds to do it perfectly the first time
[2:01:19] <%StaceMcGate> you thinking of the original male voice of Byleth, who broke his NDA and had a sketch history
[2:01:32] <NOBLExGAMER> @walt_chocolate Oh I know, they work real goood
[2:01:33] <%juxtest> Daedalus over here building a labyrinth
[2:01:34] <%AncelDeLambert> ... Pat
[2:01:36] <bob900000> @noblexgamer nope it was byleth
[2:01:44] <OldManDeckardCain> NDAs? that thing genshin impact players hate? Kappa
[2:01:44] <Devbob98> They got the high ground
[2:01:53] <Discount_CJ> Didn't that happen also to Edelgard?
[2:01:57] <%Nuclearcherries> Local gamers will know Chris Niosi from Brawl Taunts
[2:01:59] <NOBLExGAMER> @bob900000 No it was Edlegard, Byleth got metooed
[2:02:00] <%AncelDeLambert> time to bounce
[2:02:02] <%Skelefellah> Yo the Cluck colors are great.
[2:02:32] <+walt_chocolate> i have the deadfire skin as well
[2:02:32] <Srthunda> I hate cluck only because I first misread his name as chuck and thought that was appropriate
[2:02:41] <lloyddboy> Do you like dabbing on other people?
[2:02:43] <+BeeComfy> Hey pat, im I out of touch or is me telling my friend Diablo 2 remake and Diable 4 will be bad, normal? cuz I was pissed about warcraft III
[2:02:50] <bob900000> @noblexgamer the reason edelgard voice was changed was because they thought her voice didn't fit
[2:02:51] <@SoFarFetched> Pat at least it's not the "HLM 3" game that almost turned into Persona 5.
[2:02:55] <+twin_Egoist> Edelgard has different VA when the game was announced, I dont know if she was replaced due to NDA. Chris Niosi was patched out, whether it was NDA or being sexpest depends on who you ask
[2:03:01] <%TheLemuroid> I preferred Katana Zero
[2:03:01] <%dork_doggler> 3
[2:03:09] <Toni_Master43> @SoFarFetched Oh god don't remind me
[2:03:09] <+Deko_> LUL
[2:03:12] <%Daxalog> Do you like hurting people in Glass Houses edition
[2:03:18] <DickieWoodsmall_279> @BeeComfy no it just means you're a jaded old bastard like most of us
[2:03:27] <@SoFarFetched> look Im still slightly mad about that whole thing geefPoint
[2:03:31] <%LeiaSkynoober> I vaugely think that Edelgard was a union situation
[2:03:31] <%AzureGale> Hotline Miami 2 was pretty good at making fun of people who wanted Hotline Miami 2
[2:03:32] <NOBLExGAMER> @bob900000 No the Voice Actress got dumped because she started talking the second the first trailer dropped
[2:03:46] <dee388> i def prefer hm2

[2:04:05] <Devbob98> Are there people behind them
[2:04:12] <+BeeComfy> @DickieWoodsmall_279 like the meme said, No it is the kids who are out of touch. EH, im probably just over bilizzard.
[2:04:23] <%za7az> I thought Hotline Miami 2 was great
[2:04:23] <PinoProxie> IT WAS ME BARRY
[2:04:23] <+BIumen> IT WAS ME BARRY
[2:04:28] <@SoFarFetched> "IT WAS ME BARRY"

[2:04:53] <T_Sasquatch> monkaS
[2:04:59] <%bustawof> that flash meme will be timeless
[2:05:04] <DickieWoodsmall_279> @BeeComfy personally I tihnk both those games look baller as hell and are made by not the warcraft shits so they have at least a snowball's chance in hell at being good
[2:05:05] <PersonifiedTFT> yes, pat, destroy the children
[2:05:13] <NOBLExGAMER> @bob900000 Yeah it was a big deal because it was Christina Vee that was supposed to be Edlegard

[2:08:16] <CappuccinoGuil> Distract Paige with Gold and Skeletons, pro-gamer move right there
[2:08:16] <DickieWoodsmall_279> @BeeComfy one way I keep from being disappointed is by telling myself that every game is fake and will never come out
[2:08:31] <$zyberion626> SBMM is a thing, you can tell cause the comp players whine about it as much as they do about the primal shotgun
[2:08:33] <%LonePlus_> "I DONT WANNA ACTUALLY TRY EVERY GAME"
[2:08:34] <GeltonZ> Doesn't this game have split-screen? So that's something.

[2:09:16] <%LonePlus_> i used to be 400 pounds deadass its coo
[2:09:21] <%Skelefellah> That's the thing, man. If you make a quality product with quality designs, you'll rake in an audience for showing gameplay with it.
[2:09:24] <RamenRiderZ> Pat's deep into the Nite
[2:09:25] <eustine> Are the skins tax deductible?

[2:09:56] <Meltgar> I miss HotS being "Alive" tho BibleThump
[2:09:58] <Devbob98> It’s like the RE 5 play through all over
[2:10:01] <DickieWoodsmall_279> isn't real*

[2:10:29] <%Nuclearcherries> Oh thats good
[2:10:30] <%Skelefellah> That's... impressive.
[2:10:30] <Devbob98> Pat isn’t about that medic life
[2:10:31] <T_Sasquatch> wowwww
[2:10:31] <%sporeian94> I'm unironically glad I grew up with Minecraft instead of fortnite
[2:10:32] <%AzureGale> Time 2 support Child's Play
[2:10:33] <Meltgar> Oh that's nice
[2:10:34] <%StaceMcGate> Imagine a world in which Blizzard gave HOTS the support it needed
[2:10:36] <mortificent> OH GOD
[2:10:37] <+RenoDeGeneric> It's SO SLEAZY
[2:10:38] <%cvp5127> gross
[2:10:39] <bob900000> fuck that's smart
[2:10:39] <T_Sasquatch> that just scams
[2:10:40] <ToneBacas> yay tax evasion
[2:10:43] <%Nuclearcherries> Now I gotta decide between Pat or Mermaids
[2:10:43] <scrumbotime> You buy the skin, epic gets the tax write off
[2:10:43] <dragoon001914> Epic needs those tax deductions for the lawsuit against Apple
[2:10:44] <mortificent> Tax evasion genius
[2:10:45] <twiiula> can the charity be the Gief fund?
[2:10:46] <intestinal_bleeding> gross tax havens holy shit
[2:10:48] <munitalprats> yup, the charity shit that corporations do when you realize whats its for its kinda disgusting
[2:10:50] <Hericknhx> THINK OF THE CHILDREN
[2:10:52] <+Oncila> eggy5head god dam
[2:10:56] <%NovaKnightmare> Flew too close to the Money Sun
[2:10:56] <%Boxortoo> Dude, imagine all the vbuck money going to cancer foundations LOL
[2:10:59] <Devbob98> Wesley sniper has entered chat
[2:11:00] <DickieWoodsmall_279> epic doesn't pay taxes pat, they just get refunds don't you watch jim sterling
[2:11:01] <ToneBacas> help these children overcome their lootbox addiction
[2:11:02] <%Skelefellah> Didn't Epic also make an angry Apply Businessman Fortnite skin, too?
[2:11:07] <isnotavampire> HoTS is one of my most played games and it hurts my soul how it got drop kicked lol
[2:11:09] <T_Sasquatch> to be fair they did make some headway in that
[2:11:13] <%NovaKnightmare> LUL
[2:11:14] <ogmabb> PogChamp MORENITE
[2:11:16] <NOBLExGAMER> On one hand Charity on the other St. Judes Children's Hospital fund
[2:11:18] <+polothegreatest> isnt there a cap for donations in taxes?
[2:11:18] <+ThomasOfTroy> The difference between accountant wizards and idiot lawyers Pat
[2:11:20] <$zyberion626> I have to admit I'm amazed at the small army of accountants and lawyers that can suddenly magic taxes away
[2:11:20] <%solracc25> "Charity" run
[2:11:24] <+shad8snake> its how theyll learn
[2:11:29] <Mattais88> I have to kill the childen to save the children
[2:11:31] <scrumbotime> That's just how the You Get One school teacher rule is, body children for the children
[2:11:37] <$RealThiele> apple is stopping us from making 5 billion a second tho
[2:11:39] <%josstil> EAT THE CHILDREN FOR THE CHILDREN MR. HEART
[2:11:41] <%Nuclearcherries> I mean, Tim Sweeney gave me Tyranny for free so he's cool. Still gotta eat him though
[2:11:41] <Devbob98> Think of all the drugs epic CEO’s do
[2:11:42] <CappuccinoGuil> Master Chief, you mind telling me why you're a camera? "Sir, curity"
[2:11:44] <ThatDangSkeleton> there's dinosaurs now?
[2:11:48] <Meltgar> OH IT'S A SCAM?! Thought it was a "nice" thing to do
[2:11:53] <intestinal_bleeding> "Yeah."
[2:11:58] <RamenRiderZ> Justin "YOURE GONNA LEARN TODAY" Wong
[2:11:59] <Elsewize> There's *equipment* in Fortnite now?
[2:12:01] <%hrbeck_> Matt Gaetz enters the chat
[2:12:02] <munitalprats> NEVER DO THAT
[2:12:07] <munitalprats> ITS JUST FOR TAXES
[2:12:09] <+pupil31> LUL
[2:12:12] <munitalprats> IF YOUR GONNA DO IT, DO IT YOURSELF
[2:12:14] <T_Sasquatch> nope :)
[2:12:14] <+Stormzcales_Lair> yeah i was like nahhh
[2:12:16] <%Skelefellah> Don't do it. DO NOT. Do it.
[2:12:16] <%cvp5127> never do
[2:12:16] <$RealThiele> its for a tax write off
[2:12:17] <Meltgar> @ThatDangSkeleton enemy creeps that bother you or kill you
[2:12:19] <%Boxortoo> yeah don't ever do that LOL
[2:12:25] <%NovaKnightmare> the more local the charity, the better
[2:12:30] <%Skelefellah> Yeah, make sure it's straight from your pocket to the charity's, no middle man.
[2:12:30] <DickieWoodsmall_279> it's not a scam, the money goes to charity. it's just the motivations that are sketchy
[2:12:30] <Devbob98> I’d never do that, it’s a scam
[2:12:35] <BentArcher> My mother always asks if they match any donations
[2:12:35] <+Stormzcales_Lair> Also yaaay i got demon slayer tickets
[2:12:39] <CappuccinoGuil> Just say no
[2:12:42] <%cvp5127> they dont care
[2:12:44] <$RealThiele> "not today, thank you"
[2:12:46] <$zyberion626> cashiers don't care. no one cares.
[2:12:47] <%AncelDeLambert> just say "not today" they don't care if you do or not
[2:12:48] <$floralkami> and people say watching streamers can't ever be educational
[2:12:48] <@SoFarFetched> the people behind you will just look at you like geefBruh
[2:12:49] <%AzureGale> He's got a good point
[2:12:54] <%hrbeck_> they do not care
[2:12:57] <dragoon001914> But it's easier to give the store my money for charity since I'm already there and they asked me.
[2:13:04] <%AncelDeLambert> this isn't that South Park bit, they don't care
[2:13:08] <Devbob98> They’re dead inside
[2:13:15] <%ssjklyco> "your feed back has been noted and passed along  *throws in trash"
[2:13:18] <scrumbotime> I know why, but I am too weak to not hit the button. But I'll never hit a button for signing up for a store card or anything like that.
[2:13:19] <%Maids4lyfe> I only give if it's a charity that I know is real
[2:13:22] <yuribo26> What about assistant to the regional manager?
[2:13:22] <%Boxortoo> I literally tell Goodwill to fuck off when they ask if I want to round up my price lol
[2:13:32] <%Maids4lyfe> like child cancer charity
[2:13:34] <Meltgar> Quick mention of HotS, i felt bad looking at the APRIL FOOLS character... Although we knew it was a joke BibleThump
[2:13:37] <Soulsbjorne> Donate a $1 to send a hamster to College
[2:13:42] <RamenRiderZ> And then we have the FACE TO FACE goblins
[2:13:42] <%Maids4lyfe> st. judes or whatever
[2:13:47] <DickieWoodsmall_279> and they do it to gamers, the most awkward unsocial humans that exist
[2:13:49] <%MisterRockett> I couldn't get full time hours at Macy's because I didn't sign up enough people for Macy's credit cards.
[2:13:54] <$RealThiele> So having worked at chilis during their St. Jude drive. the company donates X money to the charity, then the fundraiser is to refill the companies pockets
[2:13:58] <isnotavampire> (ex-complaints manager flashbacks)
[2:14:05] <%Monkeyweed21> I remember my work doing stupid fucking "competitions" to make more money
[2:14:07] <Devbob98> Donate money to me, I am now a charity
[2:14:07] <Elsewize> Pets too??
[2:14:10] <$zyberion626> Pat's *****musk*****
[2:14:19] <%Nuclearcherries> Tame them with the smell
[2:14:19] <scrumbotime> tame the raptors with the stink of raven
[2:14:27] <$zyberion626> you don't need meat with the cloak
[2:14:37] <Mattais88> Ride him
[2:14:39] <KosOrSomeSayKosm_> dum lizer brain
[2:14:42] <intestinal_bleeding> <3
[2:14:44] <scrumbotime> Raven Musk
[2:14:47] <%Skelefellah> Nice bird lizard friend
[2:14:47] <Meltgar> RAPTOR MINION
[2:14:48] <Mattais88> Go MonHun Rise on him
[2:14:49] <%voicesbyzane> THERE ARE DINOSAURS IN THIS GAME?
[2:14:50] <$zyberion626> raptors are busted
[2:14:52] <Devbob98> Christ Pat
[2:14:59] <%josstil> SEND THE RAPTOR
[2:15:01] <%SirGO0SE> PogChamp damn hiss good
[2:15:01] <$Dreadlord134> I just logged in and.. gotdamn that skeleton skin is sick
[2:15:06] <+BusterRepukken> raptors are also very loud though
[2:15:10] <$zyberion626> @voicesbyzane it's this seasons gimmick my dude
[2:15:11] <corepercentlives> how much they added to this game holy shit
[2:15:22] <%Boxortoo> No
[2:15:22] <%Cozy90> OH MAN FORTNITE FRIDAYS
[2:15:23] <Zeif00> I don't think so
[2:15:24] <%Boxortoo> It's an old skin
[2:15:24] <+DynDimAcsiwn> there is a lot going in this game that I had no fucking clue about
[2:15:26] <DickieWoodsmall_279> it's from ch2 season 2
[2:15:26] <%Cozy90> SICK
[2:15:27] <Meltgar> No idea
[2:15:27] <NOBLExGAMER> Oh Pat, wait till you hear about the 20+ deep goons squads you could get in the Marvel Season
[2:15:28] <GeltonZ> Half a year old I think on the gold skeleton
[2:15:33] <%voicesbyzane> Forgive me I know nothing about this game
[2:15:36] <entity42o> nah the gold skeleton is like ch2 s1 i think
[2:15:40] <hairtoday> that's so raven
[2:15:41] <KosOrSomeSayKosm_> how's the free to play v-bucks gain?
[2:15:45] <yuribo26> The last time I played was the first 5th season and this looks like a different game
[2:15:51] <+DynDimAcsiwn> still have no desire to play it because the format just doesn't appeal to me but it is fun to watch
[2:15:58] <Devbob98> The raptor calls still give me ptsd, Jurassic park fucked me up
[2:16:05] <$zyberion626> @voicesbyzane oh I wasn't trying to dunk on you, shit changes a lot in FN
[2:16:07] <spicystarbursts> are there skins that are.... cash exclusive? Like is there an in-game currency you can earn?
[2:16:08] <%TallPixels> im stuck on that
[2:16:24] <+the_zyder_co> Can you tell Gianni I simply said: Gianni
[2:16:29] <$Dreadlord134> Chapter 2 season 2 was the cool spy season right?
[2:16:37] <NOBLExGAMER> You can earn a minimal amount of V-Bucks every season
[2:16:41] <$zyberion626> @spicystarbursts you can earn v-bucks in game (albeit slowly) and there are skin bundles that are direct purchases
[2:16:44] <Meltgar> @DynDimAcsiwn Fair enough, also the "fun" modes tend to be seasonal or timer. Like the 50 vs 50 one
[2:16:45] <NOBLExGAMER> Like 200
[2:16:46] <%Skelefellah> Beast Tamer team class
[2:16:51] <%hrbeck_> this one is broken
[2:17:14] <Meltgar> How many minions can you have in fortnite?
[2:17:22] <+tigerfang86> all skill
[2:17:29] <Devbob98> Is this the new Jurassic world?
[2:17:45] <%shurtal> elocution?
[2:17:45] <%Daxalog> Do you need lessons to Voice Act?
[2:18:09] <RamenRiderZ> Battle Royales are just multiplayer roguelikes dfpHEHE
[2:18:09] <T_Sasquatch> duh
[2:18:11] <%Agami23> man yuri lowenthall has one voice
[2:18:21] <Meltgar> Voice acting you NEED to practice a lot + learn to rest your voice
[2:18:38] <DickieWoodsmall_279> @Agami23 he did a thick middle eastern accent in diablo 3
[2:18:50] <%king_wragles> ProZD is basically the same case, but he shotgunned YouTube with skits before getting small gigs
[2:18:59] <T_Sasquatch> or dont rest your voice and be badger
[2:19:15] <Devbob98> I wish my voice didn’t suck
[2:19:26] <dragoon001914> Just keep talking, never stop talking.  Talk in your sleep, talk in the shower, talk to yourself in public.

[2:24:50] <$zyberion626> Paige specifically requested the jiggle to be at max
[2:24:55] <%ospreyworks> is it just me, or does Pat's stream tend to jump and stutter for anyone else?

[3:06:28] <rookielime> fortnite is a fun little game, problem is everything surrounding it

[3:07:46] <+bunchaghosts> WHOA dragon
[3:07:47] <%AzureGale> Popular things are popular for a reason - because they're good. Or because Will Smith is in it.
[3:07:49] <+AmanisHouseOfNonsense> @AmanisHouseOfNonsense It was originally used at term for being hooked on crack, but the modern meaning is to be yourself, or authentic.
[3:07:56] <%Skelefellah> Suffer like G did.
[3:07:56] <GeltonZ> @floralkami Money, and doing a couple other cel-shaded characters first and getting better at it

[3:08:00] <%thotbane> This art style makes me uncomfortable
[3:08:11] <+Javaa01> @voicesbyzane You just do it to get better at hitting the skill check spots
[3:08:21] <dragoon001914> Twilight and Harry Potter were popular but they weren't good at all.

[3:42:03] <televisedrevolting> Meth is good question mark?

[3:49:34] <$zyberion626> @BusterRepukken they weren't battlepass skins so there is a possibility, but no one can say when
[3:49:36] <BaronVonProlix> "YES"

[3:54:31] <%Nuclearcherries> Personally I've been listening to the podcast since I was 15. and I'm 24
[3:54:38] <%Nuclearcherries> Pat you shaped me as a person
[3:54:48] <Devbob98> Its weird I’m almost the same age as Pat when he first started YouTube
[3:54:50] <%Nuclearcherries> You're responsible for this mess
[3:54:50] <%ssjklyco> I started at the Machinima EDF video in 2012
[3:54:52] <+BusterRepukken> thats a scary thought Nuclear
[3:54:58] <Srthunda> If it becomes a tale between two towers, being able to appear on the other guy's tower suprises most
[3:55:01] <%NovaKnightmare> @Nuclearcherries dude same
[3:55:06] <Jathspuh> @Nuclearcherries  i'm sorry

[3:55:32] <vilecrois> the sphere hunter collabing with an orb is fairly expected really
[3:55:43] <thelonechris> I started way back at the Machinima Donkey Kong Country Returns vid
[3:55:51] <s1rcuit> she looks like the inspiration for some of the super cool skins in this
[3:56:02] <%TheLakinessMonster> But you have to carry the tradition of bullying children on shooters.
[3:56:11] <%thotbane> I started watching sometime aroooound, Chrono Trigger
[3:56:16] <%ssjklyco> Now it's Clemp's turn
[3:56:17] <BaronVonProlix> for real though i would play this if RE4 leon was added
[3:56:27] <%hrbeck_> @thotbane during, Pat said "I love getting commendations for yelling at women" and then my dad shot his shot
[3:56:38] <vile_brand> i've been in since downpour.
[3:56:39] <%NovaKnightmare> Are you guys even real RE fans? you guys dont even mutate into horrible monsters

[3:57:07] <+Rekinsinn> Makoto or Motoko?
[3:57:10] <sonofthedeepsouth> Pat I want at some point of your life you to be approached by a couple with a ten year old and the kid says that their parents are your fans
[3:57:19] <+SinisterBroccoli> matoko

[3:57:35] <%hrbeck_> matookoo
[3:57:38] <@SoFarFetched> @sonofthedeepsouth that has actually happened to him in the past LUL and Pat was like "your child shouldn't actually be watching my content"
[3:57:39] <mortificent> Motoko

[3:57:41] <+Epicdude456> The Persona 4 video was my personal favorite

[4:03:22] <%thotbane> and I can pick up the phone and tell people they got the wrong extension—which is like 80% of my job— and play Doom at the same time
[4:03:24] <sonofthedeepsouth> No kid was born after the 90s reproduction is a myth
[4:03:48] <Brandon__Brando> @thotbane give
[4:03:49] <cheezdoodle96> Pat's been a part of my life for nearly half of it, and I wouldn't wanna have it any other way.  From making the hypest shit on YouTube to streaming the hypest shit on Twitch, which I'll probably never be able to catch live again 'cause it's 5 in the morning over here… This shit's making me seriously wanna try to get into Fortnite again, was way more fun watching than I thought it'd be, even with Pat's hype, in part thanks to Pat and Gianni being Pat and Gianni. Love both you guys!
[4:03:49] <+Pyr0_Fr0st> There are adults that weren't alive before 9/11 and that gets to me
[4:03:57] <+BusterRepukken> hey Pat check out New Blood Dave's twitter to find out who wiped out Tomato Town
[4:03:58] <BaronVonProlix> were reaching a point where ive talked to young people who said Black Ops was their favourite childhood game and it makes me turn into sand
[4:04:07] <isnotavampire> it's kind of useful for dismantling sweaty builder towers but it's not great lol
[4:04:26] <+GarouFGC> I still have RE1:Remake sitting on a dusty old shelf next to a  maybe? Still works Gamecube.
[4:04:31] <+millionstabz> You should build in that situation
[4:04:37] <$zyberion626> shoot the oil cans
[4:04:39] <%AzureGale> One more game, dad!
[4:04:42] <sonofthedeepsouth> @baronvonprolix Should have been World at War TBH
[4:04:43] <%Nuclearcherries> Hey Pat, I was 1 years old when Resi 2 came out
[4:04:44] <Devbob98> He really tried though
[4:04:53] <%Nuclearcherries> Enjoy that info!
[4:05:00] <$zyberion626> *turns to dust*
[4:05:13] <DianaTheAscian> I didn't exist when re2 came out
[4:05:16] <$Quiet__Viking> I was less than 1
[4:05:24] <@SoFarFetched> chat has suddenly aged tremendously from reading these
[4:05:33] <sonofthedeepsouth> LUL
[4:05:38] <%ssjklyco> There have been only 5 mainline Final Fantasy games in 20 years since FF X than the 9 Final Fantasy games in 15 years from FF to FF X
[4:05:39] <+BusterRepukken> i was 4 when RE2 came out
[4:05:39] <%YakumoYomi> @BaronVonProlix That "What you think Final Fantasy looked like 20 years ago" meme is what really let things set in for me. The FIRST FF was released three years after I was born.
[4:05:41] <BaronVonProlix> i was exactly one
[4:05:43] <s1rcuit> when did RE 2 come out?
[4:05:44] <sonofthedeepsouth> Let it in Pat
[4:05:55] <+BusterRepukken> RE2 came out in 98
[4:05:56] <sonofthedeepsouth> 98 I think
[4:06:01] <placeholder03> Hey Pat, I'm making my way through FF9 rn, and that game is as old as I am.
[4:06:04] <%saadi90> I was 8
[4:06:05] <Valentinius_Anodyne> I remember when I was a wee bab on the internet, feeling self-conscious because I was into stuff like pokemon. Time marches on, inexorably
[4:06:05] <%MisterRockett> *Be me trying to play all the important JRPGs after missing ALL OF THE FINAL FANTASY AND DQ GAMES*
[4:06:06] <%Nuclearcherries> Don't worry! I love the original Resi games
[4:06:09] <Devbob98> I was born when it came out
[4:06:12] <%AzureGale> It's a good thing there are only 10 games that are good /s
[4:06:17] <Srthunda> I started final fantasy in 14
[4:06:20] <%xmetalicdemonx> I have no idea how to play re2 original even if I wanted to
[4:06:31] <+BusterRepukken> emulator probably
[4:06:33] <@SoFarFetched> don't people usually say 7? geefThink
[4:06:34] <Explodincatz> pick a FF game and pray
[4:06:36] <%ssjklyco> Get in to Final Fantasy at IX
[4:06:39] <TurtlesAndTentacles> But what is THE FINAL fantasy
[4:06:40] <s1rcuit> I was 8 when RE 2 came out
[4:06:41] <%dork_doggler> @xmetalicdemonx bro just pirate
[4:06:43] <sonofthedeepsouth> Start at final fantasy tactics Kappa
[4:06:48] <%DakotaMacDoodle> I was 3 Years old when Re2 came out.
[4:06:50] <%dork_doggler> none, fuck jrpgs
[4:06:52] <%xmetalicdemonx> wait what?
[4:06:53] <CappuccinoGuil> Literally the same situation with Tales of, minus the MMO
[4:06:53] <Virokwet> dq11
[4:06:55] <%MisterRockett> @SoFarFetched People usually say 10.
[4:06:56] <BaronVonProlix> @YakumoYomi i really hate this feeling, like ive talked to people who called the PS1 "that ancient console" and i slowly mummify inside
[4:06:59] <%Nuclearcherries> @xmetalicdemonx try ePSXe or PS3, PSP or PSVita ... but be quick for those three!
[4:07:00] <vilecrois> Be like woolie who only knows P5

[4:07:03] <Doublemint_Dave_> Hey pat are you winning son?
[4:07:04] <bob900000> hey pat I was born the year 3rd strike came out
[4:07:05] <%NovaKnightmare> fuck video games
[4:07:05] <%Puhff> LUL
[4:07:09] <perennialastronaut> SAYS THE GUY WHO PLAYED SAKURA BEACH
[4:07:09] <%Puhff> damn goteem
[4:07:11] <zedravan> correct answer
[4:07:12] <sonofthedeepsouth> Give me TACTICS 2 GODDAMN IT
[4:07:16] <bonebagMEL> The spirit of phil fish coming through
[4:07:18] <%saadi90> Chrono Trigger, FF6 and FF9. That’s it
[4:07:21] <GeltonZ> @CappuccinoGuil Tales is EXTRA hard since all the good ones are Japan Only...for me anyway...
[4:07:22] <%DashXero> Start with FF6 go until FF10, play FFT, if you really liked what you played, play FF12. That's all you need to know about Final Fantasy.
[4:07:25] <+Javaa01> You start at the beginning: The First NepNep
[4:07:31] <sonofthedeepsouth> I recommend Senran Kagura
[4:07:34] <%Nuclearcherries> I was born the same year FFVII came out, yet still played it 14 years later and loved it
[4:07:38] <Brandon__Brando> I was born in the god game year 1998
[4:07:45] <sonofthedeepsouth> I reccommend Rance games Kappa
[4:07:58] <%NovaKnightmare> Recommend Freddy got Fingered for Nier fans
[4:08:03] <vilecrois> ALL endings fucker
[4:08:03] <%ssjklyco> Just watch Clemps for that.
[4:08:06] <dragoon001914> FF6 is just a worse 7
[4:08:09] <+RealPT1> Wizardry, Dragon Quest and Final Fantasy is the big historical through line of JRPGs
[4:08:10] <Devbob98> They could just use clips from internet Pat
[4:08:19] <CappuccinoGuil> @GeltonZ not Japan only, some of the great ones are here, but they are on older consoles. Abyss, Symphonia, Eternia. However, the new ones on PC are fantastic, Berseria is incredible.
[4:08:21] <BaronVonProlix> Freddy got Fingered is an experience i never wish to revisit
[4:08:23] <%Agami23> man ff16 will weird for so many people
[4:08:23] <GeltonZ> @Nuclearcherries Thankyou for being cool...although honestly I'm pretty impressed at how you young'uns aren't huge bitches like we were when we were kids.
[4:08:24] <bob900000> @dragoon001914 you take that back
[4:08:26] <%MisterRockett> @sonofthedeepsouth Rance is a scoundrel and a menance and isn't invited to my parties
[4:08:30] <lotusdagoat> damn this conversation is making me feel weird. i dont like it
[4:08:32] <+GarouFGC> I usually tell people to start with FF10 because its one of the easier ones to digest.
[4:08:36] <Zourath> @dragoon001914 I fight you
[4:08:36] <$RealThiele> FF6 leap of faith coxWha
[4:08:39] <Manwad> fucking looters got reborn as LOOTER SHOOTERS I hate it here
[4:08:40] <+Dova573> its Called KI PULSE
[4:08:47] <vilecrois> watching a game is not quite the same as playing it chat, specially when you're in the business of making them
[4:08:50] <%thotbane> @BaronVonProlix DADDY WOULD YOU LIKE SOME SAUSAGE
[4:08:55] <rReizs> imagine accidentally copying cliffyB
[4:09:00] <%Agami23> they can just say "i dont play retro games"
[4:09:02] <Doublemint_Dave_> Ki pulse is based
[4:09:07] <Brandon__Brando> I think a dev would know
[4:09:14] <dragoon001914> No.  6 isn't better than 5.
[4:09:14] <BaronVonProlix> @thotbane IM A FARMER DAD LOOK IM A FARMER
[4:09:16] <@SoFarFetched> CliffyB is trying to copy what CliffyB used to "B" Kappa
[4:09:16] <GeltonZ> @CappuccinoGuil I uhh...I strongly disagree on Symphonia and Berseria is not a Tales game I'm...MAN it's complicated. My beef is the series is better in 2D but only ONE good 2D Tales game has a US release (Eternia).
[4:09:19] <bmoral64> If I want to somehow play through all the final fantasy games how can I play the older ones?
[4:09:23] <+BusterRepukken> DANCED ON
[4:09:26] <Devbob98> Soon those videos will be ancient
[4:09:32] <Smokin_Fish> rude
[4:09:34] <%Nuclearcherries> @GeltonZ It helps that the PC games I would play were pretty retro! ....for me. I played Duke Nukem 3D when I was pretty young
[4:09:34] <%Boxortoo> damn
[4:09:35] <%Puhff> "what's mario?" is a phrase that has probably already been uttered

[4:09:41] <lotusdagoat> fuck
[4:09:46] <+BusterRepukken> damn theyre real proud of that
[4:09:47] <bonebagMEL> stream sniper?
[4:09:48] <@SoFarFetched> ma'am stop shaking that booty at us geefPoint
[4:09:48] <%AzureGale> Yeah, this is done
[4:09:55] <Hoodywolf> that guy was like 10
[4:09:55] <%Nuclearcherries> And such is how I became a lesbian
[4:09:56] <%DashXero> What's the over-under on that person being stream sniper?
[4:09:57] <+millionstabz> I find Drakengard 1's gameplay actually quite soothing
[4:09:59] <Devbob98> Jesus that’s a lot of bragging
[4:10:03] <sonofthedeepsouth> Dance on Em
[4:10:04] <BaronVonProlix> oh my god Gears of War came out in 2006 im actually fucking dying
[4:10:06] <Zollington> NieR isnt THAT bad
[4:10:16] <+BusterRepukken> Probably not a sniper,. theyre just rude
[4:10:17] <+GarouFGC> Drakengard is actually hot garbage though.
[4:10:21] <%dork_doggler> @PatStaresAt How tf did those games keep getting sequels if they;'re so bad?
[4:10:22] <+Javaa01> @doublemint_dave_ Yeah that was the premier skin of a Battlepass, so they know how to get people to buy in
[4:10:22] <%Nuclearcherries> Nier is a 8/10 come on
[4:10:23] <%thotbane> i always hated gears of war
[4:10:23] <sonofthedeepsouth> Good Answer
[4:10:25] <Manwad> what if you're bad at games
[4:10:27] <Clundy> Legally Blonde came out in 2001
[4:10:29] <Zap_Rowsdower32> Nier 1 is fine to play
[4:10:32] <NitronStreams> id give neir a 7
[4:10:38] <CappuccinoGuil> @GeltonZ hard disagree. When it went to 3D and with Free Run, the game evolved, but you be you. Saying Berseria is not a Tales game has no bearing on its quality. I also forgot Xillia AKA Tales Turns Into A Fighting Game With Assists LUL
[4:10:38] <Valentinius_Anodyne> NieR is a masterpiece compared to Drakengard, at least
[4:10:47] <Zap_Rowsdower32> It's not great but its serviceable, and the writing really elevates it
[4:10:52] <vilecrois> Thats gonna be real for a lot of kids since this is a "live service" game
[4:10:53] <cochrun> when I bought my copy of nier the delivery driver put it in the middle of my drive way and I ran over it with my car
[4:10:58] <Zollington> NieR is easily a 4/5 taking the gameplay into account, 5/5 otherwise
[4:10:59] <cochrun> I think that was fate telling me someting
[4:11:02] <Zap_Rowsdower32> *The combat's not great
[4:11:05] <bmoral64> Fortnite is the Marvel movies of video games
[4:11:05] <%Puhff> nah, everyone knows shit like pong and pacman from cultural osmosis
[4:11:05] <sonofthedeepsouth> Well Pat go watch the stage plays and the listen to the vynil discs to understand nier lore
[4:11:06] <TurtlesAndTentacles> This being all people know is SAD
[4:11:07] <Devbob98> Give it ten years and people will be nostalgic about fortnite
[4:11:10] <%Nuclearcherries> Wait, who hates Berseria!? Its such a great game
[4:11:10] <Explodincatz> for so many children it is
[4:11:11] <Brandon__Brando> I know too much about video games

[4:13:35] <+Deko_> choese
[4:13:37] <CappuccinoGuil> @GeltonZ Fair enough. My main gripe is that what made Tales different from FF at the time was the action, not the 2D plane. It was only natural they'd adapt to 3D. I also started with Symphonia and Abyss, so my intro to the series was in 3D arenas.

[4:14:19] <Devbob98> Ryu needs to use your bathroom
[4:14:29] <GeltonZ> @CappuccinoGuil Yeah the 2D plane DEFINES Tales to me. It's the "Linear Motion Battle System" afterall. Without it, it's just yet another action RPG. But 2D planes don't work well in 3D.
