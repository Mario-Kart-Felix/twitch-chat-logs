[0:11:28] <tanarath> galaxy brain right there

[0:11:46] <+tizziks> What is that sword
[0:11:50] <tigerfang86> nice skeleton to make paige happy bepWow
[0:11:55] <MaritimeSpanker> obtained from Skinboy
[0:12:00] <%GreenHerbWhiteSmoke> oh yeah how many gods has it slain?
[0:12:02] <vVAstrAVv> did you look at radahns armor
[0:12:12] <ape_hawk> pat, take a leak off the edge
[0:12:18] <vVAstrAVv> its basically the new nameless king helm
[0:12:20] <signofzeta> i got a very cool sword today, actually
[0:12:21] <Happydisaster> Is that a strike weapon?
[0:12:34] <$EsotericOdyssey> oh did pat go through the belfry?
[0:12:34] <%GreenHerbWhiteSmoke> take a leak of the side mokyNODDERS
[0:12:36] <%cade_calrayn> yeah, if anywhere you could see it at the Sanctum but the clouds block it
[0:12:39] <$EsotericOdyssey> to farum azula?
[0:12:48] <MaritimeSpanker> more fucked up fingies
[0:12:48] <+alphonseisbest> OOOOH
[0:12:50] <%GreenHerbWhiteSmoke> ITS THE FIRST FLAME
[0:13:06] <MaritimeSpanker> not bad
[0:13:08] <%crimsonharvest> i like how in this game you see an elevator in the wild and its like 'of course it can go up ten thousand feet, there's more layers up there dingus'
[0:13:12] <+alphonseisbest> THIS is where all those weapon vids are filmed
[0:13:14] <%cade_calrayn> oh it's never a good sign to show up at a grace and find a dozen bloodstains around it
[0:13:29] <%tusk102> godricks is probably the best rune in the game
[0:13:30] <MaritimeSpanker> A Grace Hole
[0:13:34] <sirrice77> Doesnt that make him rannis brother?
[0:13:38] <+alphonseisbest> whats the plan for today pay?
[0:13:41] <ape_hawk> pat, is there any secrets in radahns field?
[0:13:41] <+alphonseisbest> *pat?
[0:13:43] <%crimsonharvest> they really compensated for that earthen peak->iron keep feedback huh
[0:13:45] <%greasypete00> people jumping off probably
[0:13:48] <Happydisaster> He’s rannis brother
[0:13:49] <$EsotericOdyssey> god that view of farum azula through the belfry was just DS2 dragon aerie plus the weird alpha skybox for ds3 with the flying serpents
[0:13:50] <%barrakuta371> Jeez the map is huge
[0:13:55] <MaritimeSpanker> Man, his rune looks sick as fuck
[0:13:56] <Matrixvingian> Has Pat summoned PEach into his magical realm yet in Elden Ring?
[0:14:02] <tigerfang86> One Guy
[0:14:02] <Happydisaster> Also rannis a demigod stepchild it seems
[0:14:09] <%Bluwizard21> @PatStaresAt There is a minidungeon from radahns grace point if you head to where the beach meets the cliff face on the north end
[0:14:10] <%TheGuesty> What's funny is you may be missing stuff by not walking out and instead teleporting.  Like that absolver guy at the Belfry in Darksouls1
[0:14:16] <MaritimeSpanker> What did the queens rune do?
[0:14:18] <%sporeian94> run arcs are so rare in this game I never wanna use them
[0:14:22] <+ATorL> the runes have been really disappointing imo
[0:14:24] <Matrixvingian> Holy crap that armor looks amazing!
[0:14:25] <%VictorVonLouche> Must be % based cause got a bit more than that.
[0:14:26] <Gray_LoFi> Doesn't the OG great rune just give +vigor and focus anyways
[0:14:29] <%cade_calrayn> oh I meant a different Grace, lol I just got my ass blasted by a Crucible Knight
[0:14:33] <%greasypete00> you also get it after it would be useful
[0:14:37] <%tusk102> @sporeian94 you get them for beating bosses in multiplayer dude
[0:14:39] <ape_hawk> pat, minidungeon, radahns field
[0:14:48] <Omenaire_> LUL
[0:14:48] <tigerfang86> so micro
[0:14:49] <+TomServal> Pat only uses npcs @matrixvingian
[0:14:49] <DracaenaLeaf> ri[
[0:14:51] <scorpio990> lol
[0:14:51] <+dumbledwee> is it a percent or a flat increase??
[0:14:53] <+LandOfTheWay> nailed it
[0:14:53] <%AyotoCorp> @MaritimeSpanker Just makes it so you can respec
[0:14:57] <ape_hawk> ty pat
[0:14:57] <+IxDomxI> pretty sure it's % based
[0:14:59] <%doc_ock_rokc> good job pat
[0:14:59] <%stickygumbolee> poggers
[0:15:01] <%tusk102> godricks is honestly the best rune bc its 5 to EVERY stat
[0:15:02] <MaritimeSpanker> aaah
[0:15:04] <+lOccamsTaserl> Watch that last step there. It's a doooozy.
[0:15:12] <doster504> wait there is one in Radahn's arena I was looking for like 10 minutes
[0:15:13] <%GreenHerbWhiteSmoke> L + MAIDENLESS + TOUCH GRACE + YOUR FLOCK FOLLOWS MOGH NOW
[0:15:18] <Matrixvingian> @TomServal Thanks for the head's up. Appreciated. DxCat
[0:15:22] <MaritimeSpanker> I do hope Pat finds the "poison shit dungeon" my friend told me about
[0:15:25] <$EsotericOdyssey> what did you think of the radahn fight??
[0:15:28] <Yakobro> maybe when you hit DR for godricks
[0:15:31] <MaritimeSpanker> he never said WHERE it was, but it had a cool armor which he showed
[0:15:33] <$EsotericOdyssey> I wasn't around for it
[0:15:42] <ziggy_1031> i had to step out, what did pat think of radahn's rune?
[0:15:43] <%TheGuesty> That loathesome dung eater
[0:15:44] <%Brassnarwhal> the ability to reapec is pretty cool too
[0:15:46] <%GreenHerbWhiteSmoke> did pat fight the singing poo monster yet?
[0:15:47] <MaritimeSpanker> Yeah, you sure did! there's been a couple
[0:15:55] <%doc_ock_rokc> @MaritimeSpanker there are several
[0:15:56] <Yakobro> LUL

[0:16:25] <%GreenHerbWhiteSmoke> poison shit cave indeed
[0:16:28] <MaritimeSpanker> I do hope so
[0:16:32] <MidnightPacif1c> did he fight blue eyes wight dragon
[0:16:38] <Matrixvingian> @alphonseisbest Wish Crystalis had that hype.
[0:16:40] <+lOccamsTaserl> I've hit a wall at Adan, Thief of Fire.
[0:16:46] <$EsotericOdyssey> god i hate those things
[0:16:46] <MaritimeSpanker> All I know is the armor he showed me, and it's strange as hell
[0:16:54] <ape_hawk> is THIS Anal Londo?
[0:16:56] <MaritimeSpanker> whoah

[0:17:06] <%barrakuta371> Wow this place is literally shit
[0:17:08] <%Niney_Who> With some of the Dungeons in this game, Elden ring to me really feels like "Dark souls 2-2"
[0:17:09] <+ATorL> geysers hurt
[0:17:10] <MaritimeSpanker> can't use the horse
[0:17:11] <%Sirtimbob> Did you find the color-adjective-noun monster?

[0:18:17] <%bundle_of_herbs> maybe the immunity rings?
[0:18:18] <+ConnieETC> Back dodge
[0:18:22] <+tizziks> Roll?  I know it increases rot gain, but may get you past the explosion
[0:18:23] <Matrixvingian> Does poison interrupt your charging animations with spears and axes?
[0:18:31] <$EsotericOdyssey> @greasypete00 do i gotta do the thing he asks me to do?

[0:21:35] <Lelric> Those crystal robots have their armor chip off as you do damage/multiple hits to them and start taking more damage

[0:31:41] <nukle0nik> lady?

[0:35:45] <%doc_ock_rokc> @PatStaresAt its a NEBULUS you

[0:43:21] <oda_flobunaga> There is a Faith knife that does the thing that those Jailers did in DS3
[0:43:21] <+alphonseisbest> oh shit HI DK O/
[0:43:27] <%crimsonharvest> unless I can get Big Mace, where's Big Mace from?
[0:43:35] <mrcelab> Thats not nice to say Pat
[0:43:36] <%doc_ock_rokc> @PatStaresAt Stop weaponizing anthrax
[0:43:37] <%Brassnarwhal> still gotta get one of those waifu posters though
[0:43:54] <Matrixvingian> That tiny sliver of health was still around 4k holy cripes.
[0:43:56] <%JoshManVGH> @doc_ock_rokc But it's so effective!
[0:44:04] <kinkade_77> range on the dragon spells is crazy
[0:44:30] <Matrixvingian> RIP Starting Dark Souls guy.
[0:45:15] <DKDiamantes> Torrent wants none of that
[0:45:18] <psimon_> @Matrixvingian you just started?
[0:45:23] <Saltedoasis> oh man pat has Ds armor, something tells me I missed a quest
[0:45:36] <%doc_ock_rokc> Torrent got  stopped by copywrite
[0:45:48] <DualwieldFugitive> since when does Pat have the lance of longinus
[0:45:51] <%GreenHerbWhiteSmoke> the secret ending is nuts like wtf
[0:45:51] <Matrixvingian> @psimon_ Don't own the game yet. A friend has it so I'll likely leach through them until a few years from now after DLC.
[0:46:09] <%Brassnarwhal> @saltedoasis actually he got D's Nuts
[0:46:12] <Happydisaster> These are the crows of this game, they are so annoying
[0:46:22] <+natjen8> oh man i really wonder how big the DLC for this game will be
[0:46:35] <%GreenHerbWhiteSmoke> @PatStaresAt you should def do the secret ending it is fucking nuts
[0:46:43] <oda_flobunaga> Well, Sekiro got Zilch
[0:46:44] <$realm_forge> Asshole bats would be a terrible medical condition
[0:46:50] <oda_flobunaga> @PatStaresAt yes
[0:46:53] <psimon_> @Matrixvingian I just started today, first DS game ever.But work tomorrow so ill go deep in after that
[0:46:53] <%TurtlesAndTentacles> Items
[0:46:58] <%bundle_of_herbs> item missed
[0:47:06] <17sevens> @GreenHerbWhiteSmoke which one? there is a bunch
[0:47:07] <%GreenHerbWhiteSmoke> @PatStaresAt she has an ending too but there is also a fire ending
[0:47:07] <+natjen8> are there multiple secret endings?
[0:47:10] <%Brassnarwhal> sipsipSipsipblind
[0:47:10] <%MaybeFalco> defeated by stairs
[0:47:11] <Midnight188> it does indeed have to do with Ranni's questline...and thats all anyone can say
[0:47:13] <%shootbang_exe> did you talk to ranni and iji after beating radahn?
[0:47:18] <+LandOfTheWay> pretty much all but one of the endings could be considered secret
[0:47:18] <%GreenHerbWhiteSmoke> @17sevens the fire one
[0:47:18] <sirrice77> @natjen8 yes
[0:47:19] <17sevens> @natjen8 yes
[0:47:19] <+natjen8> theres so many questlines that i feel can lead to an ending
[0:47:20] <bassoontyphoon> did you know that weather affects that damage output of your magic spells?
[0:47:44] <Matrixvingian> @realm_forge The Asshole Bats would compete with the AnalFlyingMonkeys.
[0:47:45] <%doc_ock_rokc> @bassoontyphoon Explain
[0:47:45] <+natjen8> crazy stuff
[0:47:46] <@Spydurman> don't spoil too much about the endings folks
[0:47:47] <sirrice77> @natjen8 there are 4 as far as i know that do
[0:47:49] <%TurtlesAndTentacles> Give me those 4 hands gurl
[0:48:00] <+natjen8> that makes sense
[0:48:11] <%GreenHerbWhiteSmoke> @doc_ock_rokc lightning dmg does more in rain :)
[0:48:18] <%Brassnarwhal> @greenherbwhitesmoke is that the ending that becomes darksouls, is elden ring the souls drakenguard and the endings are the different souls game, ending e would be armored core for sure
[0:48:19] <TheSaggitari> PAT GO SEE THE POPE
[0:48:23] <%TurtlesAndTentacles> Halo theme
[0:48:30] <%doc_ock_rokc> @GreenHerbWhiteSmoke oh...i thought it was talking magic magic
[0:48:31] <Giztech> @PatStaresAt are you carrying the marker from dead space lol
[0:48:33] <+natjen8> seems like elden ring is gonna be super replayable for years to come
[0:48:36] <$realm_forge> Is there a water balloon throwable that you could hit enemies with first?
[0:48:46] <literallylegit> How many areas does he have left to explore?
[0:48:53] <VioletRosefall> Stormveil?
[0:48:54] <doster504> stormveil
[0:48:55] <ape_hawk> dude, that was a SICK somersault
[0:48:58] <Matrixvingian> @Brassnarwhal Imagine fighting AC Eightball in one of these idyllic fields.
[0:48:58] <sirrice77> @literallylegit a lot
[0:49:00] <+cursedwithadhd> discount Halo theme
[0:49:05] <%doc_ock_rokc> @literallylegit yes
[0:49:07] <%greasypete00> Raya lucaria?
[0:49:08] <literallylegit> tyty
[0:49:19] <17sevens> @literallylegit spoilers, but a lot
[0:49:19] <@PrefectusCorgi> Reboot Brain
[0:49:20] <oda_flobunaga> There is some lore that seems to imply that this is the Future of Dark souls
[0:49:21] <TheSaggitari> PAT GO VISIT THE POPE FOR US
[0:49:21] <@Spydurman> just repeat Elden Ring good, over and over
[0:49:23] <%willyfreshness> whats with the Halo music
[0:49:24] <Matrixvingian> Is that considered a form of "Petting the dog"?
[0:49:25] <%shootbang_exe> fuck that sword looks cool
[0:49:27] <%Brassnarwhal> elden good brain bad
[0:49:29] <Happydisaster> Stormveil castle?
[0:49:36] <%GreenHerbWhiteSmoke> @Brassnarwhal the Ranni ending is the dark souls one or the flame one?
[0:49:52] <+alphonseisbest> DO we have any sales Figures for ER yet?
[0:49:59] <bassoontyphoon> man what a deep sleeper
[0:50:04] <Ghufufin> its always a special feeling when you encounter an enemy  and go wow they can do some cool stuff, and then murder them with something equally as cool
[0:50:06] <literallylegit> I beat this game in 36 hours but I swear I just powered through the last 50% because I just needed to see all the big baddies
[0:50:12] <@Spydurman> @alphonseisbest very loose estimates of 5 mill on Steam
[0:50:14] <literallylegit> Time to roll a mage and explore a ton
[0:50:17] <%Brassnarwhal> @greenherbwhitesmoke i was joking don't spoil it I'll get there
[0:50:31] <Matrixvingian> @alphonseisbest The concurrent user stats on Steam are around 700k so that's confirmed for PC at least.
[0:50:32] <thesaverofhumens> pat have you done any crafting? one of the biggest gripes people seem to have is there's really no reason to ever use it.
[0:50:33] <TheSaggitari> They’re singing a bad cover of the halo theme
[0:50:41] <%doc_ock_rokc> So I waited to see pat take off into the depths of this game so that I can still be surprised by the early game
[0:50:57] <%cade_calrayn> All Hail the Turtle Pope, Long May He Reign
[0:51:02] <%Niney_Who> I think Red ones refill your Crimson flask
[0:51:10] <bassoontyphoon> dog!
[0:51:12] <jubejube56> I feel bad for choirs now that half their music is just a "halo theme"
[0:51:16] <Minorou> if the orb is made of ore, it gives something good. The orb made of wood gives flask refills
[0:51:31] <%RealThiele> how does one get to the stuff reallt high up in ant cave. likes theres stuff above where the rock spitting shithead was
[0:51:31] <nukle0nik> oh hey it's Amelia
[0:51:32] <%Brassnarwhal> @greenherbwhitesmoke but i meant the fire one being dark souls, I've been joking about how the game is gonna end with a cutscene where they point at your homies and go "lead on gwyn, artorias, gough etc. begin the age of fire" or some shit
[0:51:32] <%GreenHerbWhiteSmoke> @Brassnarwhal you fight Miyazaki in one of the endings :)
[0:51:34] <@Spydurman> I feel like Elden Ring has sold at least a few million copies
[0:51:35] <SHAKETHEW> Oh damn, it's Chipp Zanuff
[0:51:49] <bassoontyphoon> why does this beast thing look like khimara from ffx
[0:51:50] <modsformeandyou> Has Pat seen any ants in the game?
[0:51:51] <%TheGuesty> front door lever usually on top of wall
[0:51:59] <%doc_ock_rokc> WHOOAH FIGHT LIKE A TIGER
[0:52:04] <%GreenHerbWhiteSmoke> @Brassnarwhal gotcha LUL
[0:52:12] <%doc_ock_rokc> WALK THOUGH THE PARK
[0:52:15] <%MaybeFalco> i didnt actually find a lever to open the door, but i may have been blind
[0:52:16] <SHAKETHEW> WALK IN THE PARK
[0:52:19] <PenguinPall> Hey Pat, I just got Oleg and I am much further than you. Good job killing that boss at that low level!!
[0:52:21] <@Spydurman> oh god the chains shaking on this enemy are like tines on a plate to my ears
[0:52:36] <literallylegit> @PatStaresAt what's been the hardest non-optional boss for you?
[0:53:00] <Ner234> Man, Chipps not looking too great these days. Did he get hooked on drugs again?
[0:53:34] <@Spydurman> @PenguinPall it was an insane fight, Pat was insanely good
[0:53:39] <+rbakervv> man, what is this sword? It reminds me of the lance from Evangalion
[0:53:40] <MaritimeSpanker> stream chugging for anyone else, or just me?
[0:53:42] <SHAKETHEW> He just met SonicFox and he a furry too now
[0:53:43] <%GreenHerbWhiteSmoke> its the lion chimera  PogBones
[0:54:05] <%greasypete00> stream is chugging for me too @maritimespanker
[0:54:05] <%bundle_of_herbs> the first one!
[0:54:11] <%TheGuesty> blue doll robots suck ass
[0:54:12] <%doc_ock_rokc> The hardest non optional boss is clearly the camera
[0:54:12] <+rbakervv> @MaritimeSpanker i had to buffer for a little bit just now
[0:54:22] <GhostPyre> Radhan was optional
[0:54:30] <%epide> keep in mind he only needs 2 boss souls to beat the game so even non optional bosses are optional
[0:54:30] <TheHotStuven> The great rune ones I think?
[0:54:30] <%sniffy77> Is Caelid optional
[0:54:31] <literallylegit> That makes sense, what's been the hardest boss then?
[0:54:33] <17sevens> i don't think pat has fought a mandatory boss yet
[0:54:44] <Maids4lyfe> Bosses with cutscenes are not optional
[0:54:45] <jubejube56> Clearly it's the final boss :p
[0:54:49] <%bundle_of_herbs> grafted scion isn't optional (to fight)
[0:54:49] <17sevens> @TheHotStuven you need any two, so you can skip any of them
[0:54:50] <%TaurusOxford> @GhostPyre he's OPTIONAL???
[0:54:55] <%epide> sry grate runes
[0:55:04] <PenguinPall> The tree guardians gave me truoble
[0:55:05] <Happydisaster> All of them are optional, you only need to kill 2 demigods
[0:55:05] <Midnight188> was Pat the one who found that Blood Temple with the Satan boss? the one that puts the Pillar Men wedding rings on you?
[0:55:05] <%greasypete00> if we're talking mini bosses those 3 crystal guys are probably the top
[0:55:06] <%epide> yeah
[0:55:09] <tri3dgE027> The stupid spear guy is the one making that one hard
[0:55:17] <%Brassnarwhal> fuck those crystalians
[0:55:21] <thesaverofhumens> @GhostPyre you only need 2 great runes so at least 1 is optional
[0:55:23] <%epide> why do you think it told pat to go to the tree already
[0:55:23] <literallylegit> I don't even know what that is LOL
[0:55:36] <Maids4lyfe> did you beat the crystalians? @PatStaresAt
[0:55:36] <%epide> @GhostPyre true
[0:55:37] <+ConnieETC> Gargoyles hardest boss Imo
[0:55:38] <+AcidRelic> I left that one after helping people for over 3 hours and no one beat them
[0:55:53] <%doc_ock_rokc> @PatStaresAt Elation transfer in a nut shell
[0:55:54] <jubejube56> On top of having to fight 3 of those bloody things they just haaaad to give scarlet rot
[0:55:55] <+alphonseisbest> ye
[0:55:59] <+alphonseisbest> big chhill
[0:55:59] <Matrixvingian> Elden Vibes
[0:56:01] <%cade_calrayn> Yeah it's a very chill game overall
[0:56:01] <Ghufufin> well in essence it is a grinding game
[0:56:02] <%epide> its hot and cold
[0:56:03] <+alphonseisbest> *chill
[0:56:03] <DestroPrime83> Whats with the Halo Music?
[0:56:10] <%crimsonharvest> it gives my brain so much to work with that i cant get antsy from ADHD
[0:56:11] <%Brassnarwhal> same
[0:56:19] <mrcelab> tmi
[0:56:20] <$realm_forge> Skyrim has the same effect for me
[0:56:25] <Maids4lyfe> yeah
[0:56:26] <doster504> @DestroPrime83 these guys had a war festival for their demigod general
[0:56:33] <+The_EL_Destino> no more wolf helmet
[0:56:34] <terrible35> this man has a metal pumpkin for a head LUL
[0:56:34] <+mup420> I'd agree if i wasnt terrible at the game.
[0:56:40] <%JoshManVGH> The most stressful is when shit is unexpected. Like talking to a merchant and battle music starts and a boss bar appears....
[0:56:40] <@PrefectusCorgi> I see more as a Meatpie Head
[0:56:53] <tri3dgE027> so this is where Max found the Flamberge rooIsee
[0:57:03] <%crimsonharvest> ez mode = summon your ashes
[0:57:11] <IminyourBase> did you manage to beat up those australians or whatever they are called?
[0:57:22] <DestroPrime83> wavy blades are so weird, do they serve a function?
[0:57:24] <CriscoKnight> My favorite thing about this that doesn't exist in other souls games is that you can literally just fuck off and experience 30 hours of other content if you can't get through a certain area
[0:57:27] <vVAstrAVv> even if the games hard consistency can be comfy
[0:57:29] <Midnight188> ez mode, two bleed weapons or magic.
[0:57:29] <%Brassnarwhal> @crimsonharvest bad take a win is a win is a win
[0:57:32] <tanarath> Without decent reflexes, and without good dodging, parrying, and blocking, this game is probably nightmarish.
[0:57:38] <bassoontyphoon> how long has it been since you saw a grace?
[0:57:42] <kinkade_77> what sacred seal are you using?
[0:57:43] <%cade_calrayn> it's the Castle Morne of this zone
[0:57:48] <%ForlornCarton> Stormveil
[0:57:49] <%crimsonharvest> @Brassnarwhal no i absolutely endorse using all your buttons
[0:57:52] <%mythcreant> @tanarath can confirm
[0:57:52] <%JustTheGuyYouNeed> raya lucaria
[0:57:53] <KasiCrafter> Meanwhile, Sekito:
[0:57:54] <oda_flobunaga> The Capital Gives me a headache.
[0:57:59] <Maids4lyfe> @DestroPrime83 yes they do actually, the wavy-ness of them acts like saw teeth and shred through your opponent's flesh
[0:58:00] <MrDuckie> can someone tell me pats current level?
[0:58:01] <@Fuggins4U> i like this halo music
[0:58:05] <%cade_calrayn> I'd say they make up for it in the Capital
[0:58:12] <PenguinPall> It is almost as if no one here wants to fight the tarnished
[0:58:12] <kinkade_77> stormviel was rough
[0:58:12] <%greasypete00> stormveil? Raya lucaria?
[0:58:13] <tanarath> Also, stuff just being everywhere without guides probably sucks for most people. You can't grind, really.
[0:58:15] <%cade_calrayn> the Capital is like 2.5 Stormveils
[0:58:21] <jubejube56> Too much scarlet rot to the brain
[0:58:22] <%crimsonharvest> also hitting armor on the tangent of a curve will cave it in a lot harder
[0:58:26] <@Fuggins4U> Grace Under Bonfire
[0:58:26] <ape_hawk> the grace hole, you mean?
[0:58:30] <%MrMegaJackpots> what sword is that
[0:58:35] <%tetraes> @PatStaresAt  which did you prefer acadamy or stormveil?
[0:58:35] <%MaybeFalco> grace hole
[0:58:37] <+Javaa01> @cade_calrayn Well, the surface is
[0:58:42] <%bundle_of_herbs> why is the boss door active
[0:58:43] <r0flwaffles> pat looking like a lothric knight
[0:58:45] <+gutlesscoward> gracefire
[0:58:48] <@Fuggins4U> what is the anti-spiral energy coming off that sword?
[0:58:48] <$drabberfaun535> Has pat gotten to anor londo yet?
[0:58:50] <+EySoyCoco> yo is that a sword or longinus spear
[0:59:06] <IminyourBase> is that the sword of Longinus?
[0:59:12] <%cade_calrayn> He's reached the Plateau and then left
[0:59:21] <@Fuggins4U> tits, balls, balls, ass
[0:59:22] <%BallerSwagBro9k> LUL
[0:59:23] <MaritimeSpanker> noted something funny about the intro, too
[0:59:25] <TheHotStuven> Were you about to say sweaty pussy again
[0:59:29] <+alphonseisbest> why does Paige sound like Morty?
[0:59:32] <GigaBombPlays> Paige just backpedaled off a cliff
[0:59:35] <+The_EL_Destino> the hymns kinda remind me of Halo
[0:59:37] <MaritimeSpanker> it doesn't mention "these are the bosses" but it goes "these are the other tarnished"
[0:59:38] <%BallerSwagBro9k> Just another days in the Life of Paige
[0:59:42] <@Fuggins4U> red hot wet blade was my nickname in college
[0:59:43] <+Javaa01> The Spicy Whetblade
[0:59:48] <$drabberfaun535> @cade_calrayn which path did he take?
[0:59:55] <%PrimalDweeb> She's talking about that guy who yelled at you guys because she spoke English.
[1:00:09] <%doc_ock_rokc> @drabberfaun535 straight through the birdge
[1:00:25] <%crimsonharvest> i like that fire is heresy, being a recovering cult kid it speaks to my iconoclast desires
[1:00:25] <Maids4lyfe> religious fervor burns
[1:00:49] <oda_flobunaga> Remember the DS3 Jailers? There's a weapon in here that has that effect.
[1:00:49] <%Brassnarwhal> but now you can make a non unique weapon have the blood slash and have fire damage
[1:00:49] <%Bluwizard21> @PatStaresAt Did you give the Storm HawkKing ashes to NEphili down the stairs past the smith?
[1:01:05] <Shiibbae> I like that “there you go buddy” is becoming this ages’ “perfect”
[1:01:13] <Happydisaster> Them making fire be faith makes such great sense
[1:01:15] <%zentheman01> I load into the stream and Pat looks like a JRPG villain with that ragged cloak and weird sword
[1:01:16] <doster504> Wait that's what those are for??
[1:01:17] <%zentheman01> rad
[1:01:22] <%sniffy77> Pat I wanna watch you play elden ring, but i also wanna play elden ring
[1:01:30] <%doc_ock_rokc> pat has resting sarcasm voice
[1:01:35] <+alphonseisbest> oh is Pat wearing the Pat clock?
[1:01:44] <MaritimeSpanker> when game big, detail hard
[1:01:44] <+LandOfTheWay> understandable, there's a lot to keep track of
[1:01:45] <%MrMegaJackpots> gotta remember to give the blorpis to glumpo
[1:01:48] <+alphonseisbest> @sniffy77 ..dd both?
[1:02:06] <%Monkeyweed21> Did Pat ever follow up on Patches tip?
[1:02:06] <Midnight188> i could play elden ring....or i could watch pat crush it and not have to skip food for a week or so.
[1:02:12] <%MaybeFalco> @PatStaresAt oh apparently the occult affinity just prevents undead enemies from reviving
[1:02:20] <Ner234> BUT only after killing Stumbo
[1:02:22] <Sir_JackalI> I've seen a couple people stating that they dislike the repeat bosses in dungeons, how do you guys feel about it?
[1:02:29] <%Brassnarwhal> think about how we feel without 600 voices in our heads telling us where to go
[1:02:35] <MaritimeSpanker> it do
[1:02:36] <+leviting> that stab seems real good
[1:02:38] <IminyourBase> Funnel has been chunneled
[1:02:39] <MaritimeSpanker> that's what Arcane is for
[1:02:41] <%discoinfierno> *glimbo
[1:02:48] <%doc_ock_rokc> I like that you have to double tap the undead
[1:02:54] <%cade_calrayn> @PatStaresAt apparently you can give Seluvis's potion to the Dung-Eater instead? No idea what it does
[1:02:54] <Ghufufin> bussy part 2
[1:02:58] <+Javaa01> @Brassnarwhal God what a lonely and miserable experience that would be
[1:03:06] <@Fuggins4U> Leomon!
[1:03:10] <Hoaxfish> it's a thundercat
[1:03:12] <MaritimeSpanker> oh
[1:03:14] <%MaybeFalco> :)
[1:03:17] <%JoshManVGH> Catman Rahdahn
[1:03:17] <%greasypete00> I've heard of this fight
[1:03:17] <bassoontyphoon> PAT V PAT LETS GOOOO
[1:03:18] <jubejube56> Nice tail bro
[1:03:19] <MaritimeSpanker> I seen this on Max's strem
[1:03:20] <%ShawnTK_> oh hey, you fought this before
[1:03:22] <+tizziks> Looks like the guy who dropped the sword made of many swords in Morne
[1:03:24] <plaguedoctor_vi> it this guy again
[1:03:26] <Happydisaster> Now boss
[1:03:28] <%sporeian94> HERE WE GO GANK TIME
[1:03:31] <+LandOfTheWay> and there's the punchline
[1:03:32] <+Resderp> Yeah a lot of bosses get... re-used
[1:03:32] <+Javaa01> Oh, it's ya boi
[1:03:35] <doster504> @Sir_JackalI I don't like when it's just two bosses that I've already foughten at once but if it's a boss with a slgith difference I think it's kinda neat
[1:03:35] <%JoshManVGH> Thunder! Thunder! ThunderCats hooooooooo
[1:03:38] <%sniffy77> oh thats bulllllllshit
[1:03:40] <IminyourBase> it's the gargoyles but with a chimera and a knight
[1:03:42] <%barrakuta371> Isn't this the same boss as the one in Morne Rampart?
[1:03:43] <%greasypete00> wow you're fucking crushing it
[1:03:47] <MaritimeSpanker> that was the easy one down
[1:03:54] <%barrakuta371> nevermind lol
[1:04:00] <LuminusVows> boss rush?
[1:04:07] <+tizziks> that roll into a poke is great
[1:04:25] <%bundle_of_herbs> also pat remember to check the altus plateu for the one armed lady you healed
[1:04:28] <tanarath> mortis

[1:12:35] <+alphonseisbest> GHOST FACE
[1:12:35] <TheBlankAce> You should also be able to initiate the rountable miracle tutor's quest by getting two big runes
[1:12:36] <%Kevlar_Caviar> the ghost face is also blue
[1:12:44] <%JustTheGuyYouNeed> Both obviously

[1:13:29] <+tizziks> Hole?  Man, I missed a lot last night
[1:13:35] <jubejube56> Y'know typically maps you pick up off the ground typically don't magically update to account for meteors
[1:13:36] <vVAstrAVv> holes not that bad really
[1:13:37] <lyzejag> The hole is too tight
[1:13:38] <%luftraumm1> i see theres new Drip
[1:13:44] <PenguinPall> As someone who plays offline, it is a great help to see your stream!
[1:13:55] <%luftraumm1> actually old drip
[1:13:56] <DestroPrime83> fuck i missed the rhadon fight?
[1:14:18] <+leviting> that guy is cool, but what is he?
[1:14:51] <%Brassnarwhal> troll
[1:14:56] <+LandOfTheWay> @leviting i think they're called trolls
[1:14:57] <%Kevlar_Caviar> @leviting he's a troll
[1:15:05] <%luftraumm1> @DestroPrime83 at the end of yesterday's VOD, pat didn't take long in that fight if you wanna watch it
[1:15:06] <%cade_calrayn> INTO THE NOKRUSSY
[1:15:14] <%Deft_Thought> Aww man, I missed the fight with Radahn
[1:15:20] <oda_flobunaga> @PatStaresAt You may end up needing directions in here.  There is some obtuse stuff.
[1:15:23] <%bundle_of_herbs> do you know how to progress blaidd's questline, because from what i read people keep not finding him again after the fight with radahn
[1:15:23] <%abakkus> wait has that always been there? or did an event make it show up?
[1:15:25] <dark_kebabs> @patstaresat I can't believe the steps you have to undertake to get the Moonlight Greatsword but I somehow got it without looking up a guide, holy shit
[1:15:27] <%Deft_Thought> Neat sword though
[1:15:28] <+Jeshk0> try finger, but hole?
[1:15:29] <%greasypete00> but it was punched in such a way that you can perfectly descend without having to risk too much
[1:15:30] <Ash_Frey> ahh this place...good luck :)
[1:15:32] <%Kevlar_Caviar> pat did radahn way faster than i expected and i am so mad
[1:15:35] <DestroPrime83> Stop adding USSY to everything you freaks

[1:18:12] <%cade_calrayn> I cleaved through them fairly easily
[1:18:17] <plaguedoctor_vi> they died as easy to my magic strait sword
[1:18:18] <vVAstrAVv> theyre just weak lol
[1:18:18] <%cade_calrayn> as a mage
[1:18:22] <oda_flobunaga> They didn't choose to live here.  They got put here

[1:26:21] <+demegodz> You hear the star wars newas?
[1:26:23] <MaritimeSpanker> imagine pat fighting a boss, and as he's about to beat it, the power goes out
[1:26:46] <DestroPrime83> Has pat ever tried the Headless Knight summon? or will he stick with Oleg forever?
[1:26:48] <oda_flobunaga> Yes it is
[1:26:51] <%Kevlar_Caviar> yes
[1:26:51] <%VictorVonLouche> ye
[1:26:54] <%vivaldiva> Ah the robust Montreal power grid I've heard so much about
[1:27:11] <%Brassnarwhal> @maritimespanker he has battery backups
[1:27:14] <oda_flobunaga> @PatStaresAt There are parts of Caelid that are really easy.  North Caelid is fucked though
[1:27:14] <MaritimeSpanker> don't worry, I'm sure Nokron will reveal it's bullshit soon enough
[1:27:19] <%boggsz12> caelid is like, weirdly disjointed in it's difficulty. some parts aren't that bad and some are fucking nightmarish

[1:27:48] <%luftraumm1> i BET there are mimics here
[1:27:49] <HyperionXV> Has Pat defeated any bosses already this stream?
[1:27:52] <tanarath> magic weapons vs. non-100% magic block, maybe?
[1:27:56] <%tetraes> god i love the underground ruiins aesthetic
[1:27:58] <Matrixvingian> End zones are just Suburbs for the Elden Ring.
[1:28:10] <%Rbeatononefour> at least three
[1:28:17] <%VictorVonLouche> staircase down
[1:28:26] <vVAstrAVv> 5
[1:28:29] <%cade_calrayn> @PatStaresAt north/eastern Caelid, the Dragonbarrow, is a higher level area than the normal Caelid swamp zone, that maybe why you felt the difficulty spike
[1:28:31] <%Brassnarwhal> 3 greatshield guys sounds very good
[1:28:50] <sun312772> @PatStaresAt have you gotten the dragon communion catalyst yet ?

[1:35:31] <+Fenrisulfr_V> @PatStaresAt Man, I've been dual-wielding Moonveil and the Meteoric Ore katana, and I basically delete any boss that isn't immune to bleeding.
[1:35:40] <%RonaldMcDownload> what's that Spear of Longinus he got do?
[1:35:44] <%cade_calrayn> yeah this place seems like Babylon and Sodom/Gomorra combined
[1:35:52] <plaguedoctor_vi> i think we already saw enough to loss that worry
[1:35:53] <%jamsbybetty> ranni has never showed up for me, do I need her to get here?
[1:35:56] <oda_flobunaga> @PatStaresAt not that way yet

[1:36:04] <%Brassnarwhal> @ronaldmcdownload it's a colossal sword with black fire damage
[1:36:07] <CriscoKnight> they'll tell you if you will die from the drop

[1:36:42] <+phtevenfry> "curse you stars!"
[1:36:46] <+Walopoh> I talked to someone who was still in early game complaining that there was less "eldritch horror" and instead body horror, I just told them they'll get what they want and then some LUL
[1:36:55] <%Brassnarwhal> these guys are much tougher than the ghosts in my experience
[1:36:56] <dark_kebabs> @jamsbybetty did she not show up to give you spirit summoning?
[1:36:57] <%Kevlar_Caviar> MOHGWYN!!!
[1:37:02] <+Fenrisulfr_V> The songs that these NPCs and the singing bats both sing is absolutely incredible, as is the rest of the music in this game.
[1:37:03] <sun312772> pain
[1:37:15] <%cade_calrayn> Wait WHAT?!? I was just here and didn't see this!
[1:37:16] <@MistyMntns> Eeeeeeee said the music
[1:37:19] <bassoontyphoon> for anyoen whos played mtg this area reminds me of Nyx
[1:37:20] <%jamsbybetty> @dark_kebabs yes but never at the later place
[1:37:23] <+ConnieETC> Make sure to explore everything here
[1:37:24] <%cade_calrayn> Goddammit Pat keeps finding shit I missed
[1:37:33] <+Walopoh> NOPE LUL
[1:37:33] <oda_flobunaga> LUL
[1:37:37] <%luftraumm1> i really need a good source for the OST of this game
[1:37:42] <%Eldalu> that sword is giving me big eva vibes
[1:37:54] <%Niney_Who> You actually have to hope it's more like DS2 tomatoLurk
[1:37:56] <dark_kebabs> @jamsbybetty I met her next at her tower
[1:37:57] <%Kevlar_Caviar> @luftraumm1 it's all on youtube
[1:38:02] <%GreenHerbWhiteSmoke> have you even found the elden ring yet?
[1:38:04] <MaritimeSpanker> was that your Mike voice, Pat?
[1:38:21] <%jamsbybetty> @dark_kebabs yeah I keep checking back after rogier told me but nada
[1:38:23] <oda_flobunaga> @PatStaresAt after this bit you are going to need to go back up
[1:38:29] <+phtevenfry> fromsoft learned from haunted house design
[1:38:31] <%luftraumm1> @luftraumm1 but is the ambient music there too?
[1:38:38] <+Fenrisulfr_V> For anyone that's familiar with what (I think) is the final area in the game, could they DM me so I can ask them a question about it?
[1:38:42] <+phtevenfry> just cram everything into a maze
[1:38:44] <%abakkus> its so unnerving how empty this place is
[1:38:52] <dark_kebabs> damn, so much missable stuff in this game
[1:38:56] <%GreenHerbWhiteSmoke> if you think about it this game is actually a rip off of Luigi's Mansion 3
[1:39:02] <+brandonsbetow> just throw colored crystals
[1:39:07] <+brandonsbetow> if it shatters, you die
[1:39:10] <%Kevlar_Caviar> @luftraumm1 yep! all of the area background songs are on the ost
[1:39:11] <%greasypete00> I like that the upgraded talismans look different to eachother
[1:39:16] <%bundle_of_herbs> inflict madness duh
[1:39:22] <%cade_calrayn> Well, considering Satan's house is right next door, I think we can guess that they fucked up
[1:39:24] <MaritimeSpanker> What kind of treasure would be worth going into a place this cursed?
[1:39:29] <MaritimeSpanker> an elden condom?
[1:39:39] <+brandonsbetow> my bad, they are called rainbow stones
[1:39:41] <Ash_Frey> they are at sarcon
[1:39:43] <%luftraumm1> @Kevlar_Caviar god thanks this is going to be the OST for my latest dnd campaign for sure
[1:39:44] <%twistedj3ster> this area is just a superior version of Skyrim's underground, which amazed me at the time
[1:39:55] <+Walopoh> I love that Elden Ring goes from Medieval into ANCIENT RUINS so much
[1:40:00] <%cade_calrayn> OH MAN IT IS
[1:40:05] <%cade_calrayn> It's fucking Blackreach but BETTER
[1:40:05] <oda_flobunaga> @twistedj3ster yep. Exactly
[1:40:09] <%TurtlesAndTentacles> I dozed off, how did we get back here lol
[1:40:20] <%luftraumm1> @twistedj3ster this one actally delivers on the idea of skyrim underground wich is a bit half baked
[1:40:23] <%Kevlar_Caviar> @luftraumm1 there's a LOT of good music in this ost, both ambient and bombastic fight music
[1:40:28] <%Kevlar_Caviar> altus plateau
[1:40:29] <ape_hawk> ALTus
[1:40:29] <Wakerz140> Altus
[1:40:31] <oda_flobunaga> Altus
[1:40:31] <+ZaheerMyHomeBoy> did you light the torches already?
[1:40:32] <+Fenrisulfr_V> Also, anyone know if there's a way to get the Bell Bearing Hunter's drops if you killed the real one before encountering the phantoms?
[1:40:32] <%luftraumm1> ALTUS
[1:40:32] <Minorou> Altus
[1:40:33] <%greasypete00> Altus
[1:40:33] <%bundle_of_herbs> altus
[1:40:34] <%JustTheGuyYouNeed> Altus plateau
[1:40:34] <%tetraes> Altus Plateau
[1:40:35] <+Resderp> it is the Atlas Plateau
[1:40:35] <+natjen8> man this reminds me so much of Ultima Thule I keep expecting "Closer in the Distance" to start playing
[1:40:35] <%JoshManVGH> Al tus
[1:40:36] <%jamsbybetty> ALtus
[1:40:36] <knotsundownsyndrome> altus
[1:40:36] <%Kevlar_Caviar> just switch 2 letters around
[1:40:44] <Ghufufin> the Persona 5 Plateau
[1:40:45] <lyzejag> ITS NOT ATLUS ????????
[1:40:47] <%bundle_of_herbs> altussy
[1:40:47] <+Resderp> Shhh... It's the Atlas Plateau now
[1:40:48] <%justcallmebobplease> the ALT-tab-us plateau
[1:40:48] <%GreenHerbWhiteSmoke> @PatStaresAt i have to interview a professional for my communication studies course, can I PM you some questions?
[1:40:50] <radiorosewater> altus, as in altitude
[1:40:50] <oda_flobunaga> Altussy Plateau
[1:40:51] <asleepykitten1> The Persona Plateau
[1:40:51] <Minorou> ALT F4 Plateau
[1:40:52] <lyzejag> IVE BEEN SAYING THAT FOR 60 HOURS
[1:40:53] <%maskofmichael> maskofmichael subscribed at Tier 1. They've subscribed for 29 months! I'm on the fence of getting Elden Ring, seeing as I've never played a soulsborne game before. Everyone say it good, but I have a basic bitch laptop and PS5's don't exist. Should I bite the bullet or just wait for it?
[1:40:57] <MaritimeSpanker> atlus makes just as much sense
[1:41:00] <TioXyco> it's not the persona plateau, dear god no
[1:41:02] <%MaybeFalco> its atlus in my heart
[1:41:02] <%Monkeyweed21> Dinosaur Plateau
[1:41:05] <%justcallmebobplease> Has Pat fought Malenia yet?
[1:41:05] <+phtevenfry> a skybox
[1:41:06] <jbrachob> SATAN thats what causes it
[1:41:08] <radiorosewater> Like an altocumulus cloud
[1:41:09] <yyyyfdugyu> the persona games creators plateau
[1:41:10] <%cade_calrayn> @Turtles_and_Tentacles we entered the Nokrussy
[1:41:13] <%ElkRiverDog> Literally "High Table/Shelf"
[1:41:16] <plaguedoctor_vi> remember to light those fires
[1:41:19] <+Walopoh> GG EZ
[1:41:26] <%cade_calrayn> @justcallmebobplease nowhere near anything like that
[1:41:26] <%twistedj3ster> @luftraumm1 In hindsight it's super half-baked, but at the time I was impressed
[1:41:27] <oda_flobunaga> @justcallmebobplease he can't get to her yet
[1:41:37] <KasiCrafter> "I don't even know who you are"
[1:41:39] <%Monkeyweed21> the casual homophobia plateau
[1:41:47] <asleepykitten1> What does lighting those fires do?
[1:41:53] <%luftraumm1> @twistedj3ster i still love the idea, and it feels like a straight up predecessor to this
[1:41:58] <%abakkus> bruh
[1:41:59] <+phtevenfry> oh deer
[1:42:00] <TioXyco> a lttle plateau. a littleau
[1:42:02] <%shootbang_exe> yeah man there's a lot here it's wild
[1:42:04] <yyyyfdugyu> my powers have doubled since the last time we met
[1:42:11] <%justcallmebobplease> Okay cool, I just wanted to be sure I didn't miss his reaction to that Phase 2.  Paige and the mold want a rematch!
[1:42:12] <+Walopoh> it is called the Eternal CITY LUL
[1:42:15] <MaritimeSpanker> wasnt it down by the big statue that pat fought the other dragonkin?
[1:42:22] <%VictorVonLouche> Massive dlc
[1:42:31] <GamerWorlock> dlc
[1:42:37] <+ConnieETC> BB2
[1:42:37] <%MaybeFalco> i dont even know how the fuck a sequel would follow up to this
[1:42:39] <Manwad> caelid kart
[1:42:41] <Ghufufin> @PatStaresAt similar game in a different universe you mean?
[1:42:42] <snakesolidmyore> prequel
[1:42:45] <%Bluwizard21> yeah this kinda feels like the end all beat all for fromsofts soulsbornring
[1:42:45] <%luftraumm1> bloodborne two
[1:42:45] <ape_hawk> STEPHEN KING PRESENTS, ELDEN RINGER
[1:42:46] <morkelebmink> they did blood borne as a one shot
[1:42:48] <morkelebmink> so why not this
[1:42:50] <+5Two> prequel?
[1:42:51] <%TurtlesAndTentacles> Same world different name Pat?
[1:42:52] <%Brassnarwhal> maybe they will let sanderson do one
[1:42:54] <+Walopoh> that is VERY SATISFYING
[1:42:55] <+FlappySeal_> Super Elden Ring Ultimate
[1:42:56] <+cursedwithadhd> just skip to  Dark Souls 5
[1:42:58] <+leviting> old bracelet
[1:42:59] <%justcallmebobplease> What if they just keep contracting different writers for DLC expansions, and forever update and re-release it like Skyrim?  I'd be down!
[1:43:00] <yyyyfdugyu> elden ring battleroyale pog
[1:43:00] <%Pookiedaexzile> Play this  before Pat Starts Elden ring 2
[1:43:01] <%JustTheGuyYouNeed> Honestly there is stuff for a sequel on the same universe
[1:43:04] <plaguedoctor_vi> i think since Miazaki has become important in his company i think for him he will not do sequals anymore
[1:43:04] <$realm_forge> Elden ring 2: Elden rung
[1:43:06] <%Deft_Thought> All this space shit and the bells make me think that Elden Ring is some weird origin story for Bloodborne
[1:43:06] <oda_flobunaga> @MaritimeSpanker different one, different zone
[1:43:09] <%Brassnarwhal> i would kill my whole family for elden ring with brandon sanderson writing
[1:43:16] <+leviting> eldest band
[1:43:17] <%greasypete00> I could see from getting contract offers for doing games for some other existing IP
[1:43:19] <+mup420> What about dlc?
[1:43:20] <Happydisaster> More oneshot settings please
[1:43:20] <Midnight188> have Brandon Sanderson do the DLC
[1:43:26] <%Deft_Thought> @realm_forge PogChamp
[1:43:27] <MaritimeSpanker> I'd honestly rather they didn't go back to Dark souls in name at all, to be honest
[1:43:33] <bassoontyphoon> DaVinci Code Souls with Dan Brown is my nightmare scenario
[1:43:36] <oda_flobunaga> @PatStaresAt want to know where the grace is?
[1:43:37] <+heyitsbrian> RTS Prequel to show the big fight cinematic at the start!
[1:43:41] <+FlappySeal_> I feel kinda bad for them, because if they go back to more closed off and somewhat linear Souls-style, it's just gonna feel so small
[1:43:42] <plaguedoctor_vi> if he was important in the times of Dark souls probally dark souls 2 and 3 would have not happend
[1:43:42] <%Kevlar_Caviar> so they're totally gonna do dlc right? there's so much lore shit that's only barely touched on that i'd love to learn more about
[1:43:42] <%Deft_Thought> Damn Pat, they were just groovin
[1:43:42] <%Bluwizard21> @PatStaresAt Light the torches like in the first part of this area
[1:43:44] <ape_hawk> Imagine an elden ring game written by Acclaimed Author Chuck Tingle
[1:43:47] <%Rbeatononefour> nooo the deer
[1:43:49] <%Monkeyweed21> also I'm pretty sure Miyazaki doesn't like making sequels
[1:43:50] <MidnightPacif1c> time travel dlc again maybe?
[1:43:51] <MaritimeSpanker> just making new and cool things are dine imo
[1:43:55] <MaritimeSpanker> oh, he glowie
[1:43:57] <%Brassnarwhal> @midnight188 i want him to do the worldbuilding cause he's way better at it than grrm
[1:44:01] <Ghufufin> @PatStaresAt i agree. people love but it is the gameplay loop that really makes it great. Also there are some really other concepts that could be amazing in this style
[1:44:08] <oda_flobunaga> Elden Ring 2, by Stephanie Meyer
[1:44:11] <Ghufufin> the lore*
[1:44:13] <+FlappySeal_> She's just singing, not a single fuck given
[1:44:18] <%maskofmichael> Elden Ring, but David Cage
[1:44:23] <+ConnieETC> HP lovecraft and Fromsoftware Kappa
[1:44:27] <%GreenHerbWhiteSmoke> gross why do they glow like that
[1:44:32] <MaritimeSpanker> ah, another waifu
[1:44:35] <rosabellamelantha> Oh sweet I was able to catch this part of the stream
[1:44:36] <MaritimeSpanker> big unga bunga woman
[1:44:37] <%Bluwizard21> viking woman just happily singing, not hurting noone then pat throws lightning in her face
[1:44:42] <%Bluwizard21> @PatStaresAt Light the torch pat
[1:44:44] <%TurtlesAndTentacles> thats a she I think
[1:44:51] <%Brassnarwhal> @maskofmichael think of how many non consensual nudity scenes he could hide in this elden ring world
[1:44:52] <%matf8> how upgraded is your twisty sword now?
[1:44:53] <oda_flobunaga> Elden Ring 2, by David Lynch
[1:45:01] <plaguedoctor_vi> @ConnieETC the final boss is going to have his cat name
[1:45:05] <%Monkeyweed21> BECOME MOOSE
[1:45:07] <DestroPrime83> The Stag bosses theme is sooooo fucking cool
[1:45:12] <oda_flobunaga> Actually 7
[1:45:21] <Zourath> Ellden Ring
[1:45:25] <%TurtlesAndTentacles> They have nice voices
[1:45:37] <+ConnieETC> Grace near cliffs

[1:46:41] <MaritimeSpanker> give her 9 months, she'l lbe holding a baby alright
[1:46:42] <femto216> Big genocide
[1:46:45] <calmsoul689> does anyone know if pat got the hidden bow that is under the bridge where the boss is?
[1:46:52] <bassoontyphoon> Maybe it’s a baby skull though
[1:46:56] <Happydisaster> I would not mind seeing them make a feudalistic sci fi setting like dune
[1:47:00] <Manwad> @calmsoul689 he did
[1:47:07] <%TurtlesAndTentacles> @MaritimeSpanker Damn dude lol
[1:47:17] <calmsoul689> @calmsoul689 sweet thanks
[1:47:22] <+marlborored5> it's probably the singing and collor and skulls, but heavy shrine of amana vibes

[1:52:25] <Happydisaster> No
[1:52:26] <+SpiritRoads> it drops mats
[1:52:27] <Midnight188> makes it go away
[1:52:28] <%BallerSwagBro9k> It drops your balls
[1:52:28] <HyperionXV> @xxHungryxx Godslayer greatsword, from a chest in the divine tower with a bunch of platforming and the godskin boss
[1:52:29] <bassoontyphoon> Yee
[1:52:35] <+phtevenfry> it drops sick beats
[1:52:38] <%TurtlesAndTentacles> Be like the wind
[1:52:41] <+Walopoh> your honor
[1:52:43] <bigstupidjellyfish1337> pat is it accurate to describe this game as the biggest hall wug ever?
[1:52:45] <morkelebmink> but what about your pride as a warrior Pat?
[1:52:46] <%Monkeyweed21> do it no balls
[1:52:48] <%ElkRiverDog> Drops smackdowns
[1:52:54] <Ghufufin> @PatStaresAt the Dog drops bodies apparently
[1:52:56] <calmsoul689> i think you got most of the items already except the boss
[1:53:13] <%TalisKanju> Pat and Paige streaming at the same time?
[1:53:30] <oda_flobunaga> @PatStaresAt by the way, Progress is following the Big stupid Jellyfish, when you are ready.
[1:53:31] <+tizziks> gotta jump in from top
[1:53:31] <+Walopoh> texts to show to a Victorian Child
[1:53:37] <sun312772> @TalisKanju yea
[1:53:40] <17sevens> jump from the cliff
[1:53:45] <%AsherCaelum> watch both gingers
[1:53:47] <+LandOfTheWay> i'm working on putting together this game's lore, and i think the fact that we can see the night sky underground is actually literal
[1:53:49] <%AsherCaelum> at the Same Time
[1:53:51] <xxHungryxx> @hyperionxv So it's a faith weapon I take it?
[1:54:05] <%SWFanatic> Are ya winning son?
[1:54:11] <+ConnieETC> Climb
[1:54:17] <Gray_LoFi> There's a wort as well
[1:54:20] <%twistedj3ster> ooh
[1:54:24] <jubejube56> I think it was actually a dex weapon technically
[1:54:28] <%AsherCaelum> everything in this game is a faith weapon.  Elden Ring is Miyazaki's 80 hour apology for faith in DaS3
[1:54:29] <jubejube56> had a faith requirement
[1:54:46] <%Monkeyweed21> remember, double jumping increases fall damage
[1:54:56] <MaritimeSpanker> it another hot lady
[1:55:05] <%Niney_Who> Is that one holding ab aby
[1:55:07] <+phtevenfry> I like big shaman lady
[1:55:10] <HyperionXV> @xxHungryxx yeah
[1:55:13] <%Mister_McDerp> bye sexy lady
[1:55:14] <%Bluwizard21> god all these people are horny
[1:55:14] <+FlappySeal_> this item is... something
[1:55:14] <oda_flobunaga> Its useable
[1:55:18] <ergulor> death to baby
[1:55:19] <%Niney_Who> That is a WEAPON pat
[1:55:19] <+Shimano232> usable item like the mimic veil
[1:55:21] <%Bluwizard21> @PatStaresAt it's an item
[1:55:25] <%luftraumm1> catalyst i bet
[1:55:28] <%matf8> now to find the rest of the baby
[1:55:29] <%Niney_Who> Er, sorry no
[1:55:35] <%Niney_Who> Useable Flamethrower
[1:55:38] <+hakumaribo> @PatStaresAt you hitting treasure chests is making me nervous, are there mimics? fuck off if there are, i hate those creepy things...
[1:55:47] <%tetraes> Baby Skull flamethrower
[1:56:05] <calmsoul689> any bets on how fast pat can beat the boss
[1:56:11] <%BallerSwagBro9k> dont forget that
[1:56:15] <%Monkeyweed21> baby skull seeking lightning spears

[2:02:09] <%Mister_McDerp> he already heard the song from the first version of the boss
[2:02:09] <knotsundownsyndrome> it's the most unique in the game
[2:02:10] <Maids4lyfe> it was good

[2:02:25] <%Nekros4442> he heard it from the firsr deer
[2:02:26] <%luftraumm1> that track is no shit incredible
[2:02:32] <EynoStiles> What sword is that?
[2:02:33] <Varanoo> lore please
[2:02:35] <%cade_calrayn> Yeah it starts to heal itself
[2:02:36] <MaritimeSpanker> The music in this game has been top-fucking-notch
[2:02:36] <+alphonseisbest> BIG DRAGON ROT DAMAGE
[2:02:38] <+5Two> Have you seen the video of a quest giver getting killed by a dog infected by the rot?
[2:02:39] <%abakkus> now who's the one who is big and also strong
[2:02:40] <Gorgs7> it was pretty nice
[2:02:44] <+ConnieETC> And the third heal phase…
[2:02:51] <oda_flobunaga> Now, down.
[2:02:53] <%Mister_McDerp> too good to see more content
[2:03:00] <xxHungryxx> The Canadian God
[2:03:04] <Ghufufin> heresy
[2:03:05] <+alphonseisbest> ye
[2:03:17] <+tizziks> Seems to be a god not the god
[2:03:21] <jubejube56> No but worship golden tree tho
[2:03:25] <MaritimeSpanker> Erdtree feels like the Fire from dark souls
[2:03:26] <megaman_sentinel> that will always be gross to look at
[2:03:27] <rosabellamelantha> the talisman is actually great
[2:03:28] <+alphonseisbest> BIG STR DAMAGE
[2:03:28] <MaritimeSpanker> WHOAH
[2:03:32] <rosabellamelantha> cus it works in invasions too
[2:03:42] <%BallerSwagBro9k> ITS SUPER GOOD
[2:03:46] <oda_flobunaga> YEYEYEYE
[2:03:48] <rosabellamelantha> it's not MUCH per enemy
[2:03:51] <MaritimeSpanker> that one is fucking good
[2:03:51] <rosabellamelantha> but it adds up
[2:03:54] <%Mister_McDerp> ooh
[2:03:55] <%Nekros4442> yep
[2:04:00] <+alphonseisbest> FUCKING SITH MAGIC
[2:04:02] <%BallerSwagBro9k> @patstaresat its very small FP recovery
[2:04:07] <%BallerSwagBro9k> sadly
[2:04:08] <tri3dgE027> The horns sounds like a scam, isn't it the Blue Assassin Blade better?
[2:04:08] <%TheAdMerlin> That spirits horn seems great
[2:04:15] <%luftraumm1> is it a talisman?
[2:04:17] <%BallerSwagBro9k> Pat
[2:04:18] <MaritimeSpanker> it's super worth it
[2:04:18] <oda_flobunaga> @PatStaresAt enough to matter
[2:04:19] <rosabellamelantha> it's small but it adds up over time
[2:04:22] <+tizziks> How many of these can you duplicate?
[2:04:26] <%BallerSwagBro9k> Like micro
[2:04:26] <+FlappySeal_> 3FP per kill
[2:04:26] <Ekaelis> did i miss the festival?
[2:04:28] <+FlappySeal_> iirc
[2:04:33] <%Kiiper> 15ish a kill
[2:04:35] <Midnight188> prolly 5-8% id wager
[2:04:36] <MaritimeSpanker> I mean, if you kill 5 small enemies that'd be dope
[2:04:43] <%luftraumm1> your talisman slots are filled right?
[2:04:47] <MaritimeSpanker> @Ekaelis yes, last stream was festival
[2:04:48] <$EsotericOdyssey> that's a detail I like about Elden Ring's lore so far: it starts out feeling like the Erdtree/Golden Order IS the be-all-end-all of this universe's cosmology, but then you learn about stuff that wants to usurp it AND stuff that came before the Erdtree became dominant
[2:04:55] <+alphonseisbest> hold on to it for now?
[2:05:01] <%luftraumm1> back to cairan knight armour?
[2:05:06] <%G_476> Did you get a talisman slot from the boss?
[2:05:09] <+alphonseisbest> welp
[2:05:11] <Ekaelis> @MaritimeSpanker Damnit, can't wait to see Pat's opinion Radahn fight
[2:05:11] <%epide> dont forget the blue dagger talisman it regens fp on critical hits
[2:05:16] <%strakillias> need 28 faith I think
[2:05:29] <%luftraumm1> you've been forgetting greyells roar tbf
[2:05:30] <Saltmeisterr> do you even need the roar?
[2:05:38] <oda_flobunaga> @Ekaelis he beat him
[2:05:41] <rosabellamelantha> @PatStaresAt there are lots of area that have tons of enemies and killing 10 is 30fp back which is a fairly ok part of your bar
[2:05:42] <%VictorVonLouche> City
[2:05:43] <TioXyco> yes
[2:05:44] <$drabberfaun535> yes
[2:05:45] <%JustTheGuyYouNeed> jellyfish
[2:05:46] <vVAstrAVv> city
[2:05:49] <oda_flobunaga> @PatStaresAt city first
[2:05:50] <+tizziks> city!
[2:05:52] <EynoStiles> jellyfish
[2:05:53] <+ConnieETC> Jellyfish
[2:05:53] <@PrefectusCorgi> Yes
[2:05:55] <plaguedoctor_vi> the city is the last part
[2:05:55] <%luftraumm1> i bet jellies aren't progress
[2:05:55] <+Shimano232> jelly
[2:05:55] <Saltmeisterr> jelly
[2:05:55] <%shootbang_exe> city then jelly is what I did
[2:05:56] <xxHungryxx> Follow the Jelly
[2:05:56] <%cade_calrayn> jellyfish? what jellyfish?
[2:06:01] <lyzejag> JELLY
[2:06:01] <$vehementvadr> go to the city of blue jellyfish?
[2:06:02] <+Fenrisulfr_V> Jellyfish. Miht as well get the bad one out of the way first.
[2:06:03] <jubejube56> but jelly tho :(
[2:06:04] <%sonuke_draws> Jelly
[2:06:04] <rosabellamelantha> Blue jellyfish leads to a different area that's WAY tougher
[2:06:06] <tanarath> go wherever
[2:06:11] <%Bluwizard21> @PatStaresAt The blue jellyfish lead to a grace then to a hard series of fights then to a boss then to an entirely new area that I'm currently in
[2:06:14] <plaguedoctor_vi> is where you will find what Ranni wants
[2:06:23] <%Niney_Who> Welcome to Anor Londo 2
[2:06:25] <asleepykitten1> "Follow the blue jellyfish" sounds like a euphimism for a drug trip
[2:06:27] <rosabellamelantha> Yahargul?
[2:06:30] <%Niney_Who> sorry
[2:06:33] <%Niney_Who> Anor Yharnam
[2:06:33] <plaguedoctor_vi> bad news or good news?
[2:06:35] <+Walopoh> Bloodborneville
[2:06:45] <radiorosewater> Cathedral Ward
[2:06:52] <MaritimeSpanker> stoned hypemen
[2:06:52] <Maids4lyfe> yeah this is bloodborne af
[2:06:56] <adithehella> Bad 2
[2:06:57] <ape_hawk> something bad ALWAYS happened to people in soulsborne games
[2:06:59] <+Fenrisulfr_V> Your character already looks like a Bloodborne, so it works out.
[2:07:00] <%twistedj3ster> It's like you farted down here
[2:07:01] <xxHungryxx> He says it like it's an enemy type "That's a Bloodborne"
[2:07:07] <+5Two> Amigdala?
[2:07:07] <$realm_forge> That’s a big bloodborne
[2:07:09] <%shootbang_exe> no it's fine they all just went to a farm upstate
[2:07:11] <%NopeBadguy> Oop, popped in but I haven't seen this area, so I should probably pop out
[2:07:13] <$drabberfaun535> this is like shulva and Oolacile mixed together
[2:07:13] <%shootbang_exe> all at once
[2:07:13] <%NopeBadguy> Enjoy the game
[2:07:16] <%Niney_Who> I mean if your city is underground it's usually a sign that something HORRIBLE happened
[2:07:24] <%bundle_of_herbs> did you visit the pope after radahn?
[2:07:27] <%MaybeFalco> its true, some enemies are a bloodborne
[2:07:30] <rosabellamelantha> finding out what happened to these dudes is my favourite bit f small lore in the game
[2:07:31] <%luftraumm1> horse still usable?
[2:07:53] <skagtheprinceofhell> You mean Tortoise Pope?
[2:08:08] <%luftraumm1> more mimics
[2:08:09] <%strakillias> like a bitch
[2:08:12] <Ekaelis> I recognize this sword.. well, somewhat
[2:08:15] <+tizziks> The space pope
[2:08:15] <+rbakervv> man, they really took advantage of being able to jump in the level design, didn't they?
[2:08:15] <+alphonseisbest> god they ARE MAGIC T-1000S
[2:08:18] <%luftraumm1> popoise
[2:08:19] <%Niney_Who> These things are full on Adapting to be humans
[2:08:22] <Ekaelis> It was that Friede knight guy sword
[2:08:24] <%ElkRiverDog> Getting meteor punched into the substrate is rarely a good start to anything
[2:08:28] <%BallerSwagBro9k> I got that sword early too. Carried thru most of the game
[2:08:32] <$drabberfaun535> wrecked the wretch
[2:08:50] <Maids4lyfe> Izalith didn't have T-1000s
[2:08:51] <+SpiritRoads> yeah thats pretty early
[2:08:53] <%Kevlar_Caviar> godskin apostle is a pretty late game boss tbh
[2:08:53] <%Niney_Who> Yes
[2:08:54] <skagtheprinceofhell> I mean, this game big
[2:08:54] <sun312772> yep
[2:08:57] <%luftraumm1> gotta be halfway at LEAST
[2:08:57] <%boggsz12> you got it early as fuck lmao
[2:09:00] <%Kevlar_Caviar> in terms of difficulty
[2:09:00] <xxHungryxx> What is like fe
[2:09:03] <%strakillias> Well that boss fight was kinda fucked up
[2:09:04] <$Smokay17> Pat doesn't realize he's still in the prologue.
[2:09:06] <xxHungryxx> life*
[2:09:07] <+Shimano232> Im currently at 82 hours and not done yet
[2:09:07] <KasiCrafter> Could be worse. Could be infected by the X virus
[2:09:08] <+Fenrisulfr_V> I got my back blown out instantly by the Godskin boss for that sword until I was level 100+.
[2:09:09] <%maskofmichael> Million hour game?
[2:09:09] <%MaybeFalco> because dragon barrow is "further" than the capital i guess
[2:09:09] <lyzejag> Yeah dude, i got that one at 30
[2:09:12] <%Niney_Who> Here's the MOST TERRIFYING ENEMY THOUGH
[2:09:13] <%greasypete00> basing it on how many souls the boss dropped you were probably supposed to come back closer to end of game
[2:09:14] <+IxDomxI> @PatStaresAt the enemies in that area are scaled way up, so this is having it early
[2:09:19] <%BallerSwagBro9k> Lol I beat everything in 55 hours
[2:09:19] <oda_flobunaga> This game's Izalith equivalent is Soooooooooooo fucked

[2:09:29] <SilverBrass> I think you're expected to be lvl 200 or something. People are used to bosses dying in five hits or something?
[2:09:29] <rosabellamelantha> THE STRONGEST ENEMY
[2:09:31] <xxHungryxx> Pat, this is all still the tutorial

[2:11:10] <penitentpendant> The one summon, TO RULE THEM ALL
[2:11:12] <+SilverDevilfish> Quicksilver
[2:11:15] <%dekkitout> Yo- that summon bangs
[2:11:15] <rosabellamelantha> @PatStaresAt fully upgraded that mimic is broken beyond all belief
[2:11:17] <%shootbang_exe> read description
[2:11:18] <+tizziks> HP cost?
[2:11:19] <TheHotStuven> MEMEK!!
[2:11:20] <%MaybeFalco> YEAH, HP
[2:11:20] <%VictorVonLouche> HP cost making yourself
[2:11:20] <chowndawg> sick
[2:11:21] <+Walopoh> Let's test it out?
[2:11:22] <%BallerSwagBro9k> Yep
[2:11:23] <lyzejag> BUSTED
[2:11:24] <+SpiritRoads> most busted summon in the game
[2:11:24] <%luftraumm1> 660 is a LOT
[2:11:24] <%MaybeFalco> CAUSE ITS YOU
[2:11:25] <+hakumaribo> the best summon in the game
[2:11:25] <+FZeroDMX> This summon is so fun
[2:11:26] <Scorilla> OH NO
[2:11:27] <+alphonseisbest> LORE pls
[2:11:27] <morkelebmink> try it out
[2:11:28] <$sarah_galb> read what it does
[2:11:30] <casualbaloth> iwell
[2:11:30] <AtisutoCurry> MEMEIC
[2:11:30] <rosabellamelantha> not max
[2:11:31] <%shootbang_exe> it makes another you
[2:11:31] <%BallerSwagBro9k> About 3/4 of your HP
[2:11:32] <rosabellamelantha> set
[2:11:34] <penitentpendant> No, you can heal it
[2:11:34] <+SpiritRoads> no 660 of your health
[2:11:34] <+ZaheerMyHomeBoy> it's so strong
[2:11:35] <+Fenrisulfr_V> That summon is the only reason I've been able to kill certain bosses at all.
[2:11:37] <$sarah_galb> its a static 660 @PatStaresAt
[2:11:38] <%BallerSwagBro9k> No
[2:11:38] <Wakerz140> It's a fixed amount
[2:11:40] <%Nekros4442> yep, easilu the best summon
[2:11:40] <sirrice77> nah you just take damage
[2:11:40] <%Bluwizard21> @PatStaresAt Once upgraded to +10 it is stronger and better than you yourself
[2:11:41] <%AyotoCorp> @PatStaresAt I think it scales based off your estus sip
[2:11:41] <tanarath> Yes sir, HP can be used like mana.
[2:11:42] <+Fenrisulfr_V> Current, as if you took damage.
[2:11:50] <%Niney_Who> OH
[2:11:53] <+Shimano232> just temporary
[2:11:54] <%dekkitout> Slap a heal spell on that sucker and it tanks
[2:11:55] <%shootbang_exe> yeah that went well
[2:11:56] <%Niney_Who> These are SCIENCE EXPERIMENTS
[2:11:59] <+Walopoh> it's like Mana
[2:12:01] <+tizziks> Ahhh they tried to force an Elden Lord and fucked it all up
[2:12:02] <%Niney_Who> ARTIFICIAL LORDS
[2:12:03] <%strakillias> Can you kill yourself with it by accident?
[2:12:03] <%Niney_Who> that is RAD
[2:12:04] <Manwad> so everyone wanted a lord and there were attempts to do it
[2:12:06] <Ash_Frey> its like 80 percent
[2:12:07] <TheHotStuven> Goodbye Oleg, hello Memek
[2:12:10] <+lucky_icarus> USE THAT! OLEG IS A BITCH COMPARED TO MIMIC
[2:12:10] <+Walopoh> o7 Oleg
[2:12:11] <penitentpendant> Oleg betrayal
[2:12:11] <jubejube56> So how much vit is 660 hp?
[2:12:15] <%discoinfierno> Too broken imo
[2:12:15] <xxHungryxx> Is Oleg being replaced 🥺
[2:12:16] <%TurtlesAndTentacles> HOW DARE YOU
[2:12:17] <SilverBrass> Not gonna lie, the mimic's a BEAST
[2:12:19] <Happydisaster> Artificial lords lol
[2:12:21] <sirrice77> No longer friends with oleg MIMIC is my friend now
[2:12:25] <skagtheprinceofhell> Is that a roc?
[2:12:29] <+Edrem> jump out the window near the imp statue
[2:12:31] <rosabellamelantha> @PatStaresAt it mimics your loadout at the moment you summon it, which means if you put a staff or talisman on and then summon you get a friend with infinite FP slinging spells
[2:12:31] <+Fenrisulfr_V> I don't know if The Lands Between can tolerate two Pat Orbs.
[2:12:39] <MaritimeSpanker> I know of one more summon that costs HP, but I am NOT gonna spoil it, because it was very funny
[2:12:41] <gentlemanboxer> Marble Madness
[2:12:42] <julrave> orb
[2:12:47] <jbrachob> So you get summon swords, judgement cut, AND doppleganger ...VIrgil IS the MC of elden ring
[2:12:47] <+Walopoh> LUL
[2:12:48] <%Niney_Who> No get that item first
[2:12:50] <%shootbang_exe> LOL
[2:12:50] <+Jeshk0> LUL
[2:12:53] <tanarath> creepy49Porpkek
[2:12:53] <%SlimmieP> Just got here, Pat's throwing lightning spears at a bowling ball. Oooooh Elden Ring
[2:12:55] <oda_flobunaga> LUL
[2:12:57] <%greasypete00> he turned into a dog
[2:12:59] <lyzejag> JUMP
[2:12:59] <MaritimeSpanker> OOH NICE SAVE
[2:13:00] <%KineticZen> Pat becomes doggy
[2:13:03] <penitentpendant> Yeah, this area is... vexing to navigate
[2:13:04] <x2Twistedx> sounded like a small dog welping hahaha
[2:13:06] <%BallerSwagBro9k> That sounded like a puppy LUL
[2:13:07] <%barrakuta371> Pat makes the most intriguing sounds sometimes
[2:13:11] <+Walopoh> I actually yell-laughed, you sounded like an injured dog
[2:13:15] <%vivaldiva> psaJpeg psaJpeg
[2:13:16] <lyzejag> Dogboy Pat
[2:13:24] <radiorosewater> woolieS woolieT
[2:13:25] <radiorosewater> woolieF woolieU
[2:13:27] <%luftraumm1> I LOVE those yelps
[2:13:28] <radiorosewater> YES
[2:13:28] <%ElkRiverDog> psaDogchamp psaBork
[2:13:30] <sun312772> LUL
[2:13:34] <penitentpendant> He's becoming more like Zangief every day~
[2:13:34] <anAngryHamster> Is this Anor Londo?
[2:13:36] <%strakillias> You sounded like one of the good aliens from Galaxy Quest
[2:13:39] <MaritimeSpanker> OH
[2:13:43] <MaritimeSpanker> that's the boss's hammer
[2:13:45] <%dekkitout> I bet they used the wrong flower
[2:13:48] <%dekkitout> *flour
[2:13:48] <rosabellamelantha> that's not what killed them btw
[2:13:50] <MaritimeSpanker> the one that spun out in the bossfight
[2:13:51] <DestroPrime83> floppy hammer
[2:13:53] <%greasypete00> so its literally izalith huh
[2:13:53] <MaritimeSpanker> cool
[2:13:56] <oda_flobunaga> @Not quite
[2:13:56] <+0ni0n_L0rd> It happens
[2:13:58] <Ekaelis> Simple and effective
[2:13:58] <%TurtlesAndTentacles> So maybe the Erd Tree is the end all these are just Heretics
[2:13:59] <penitentpendant> "Make an artificial god, what could go wrong?"
[2:14:01] <Hoaxfish> what's an elden lord supposed to do
[2:14:12] <radiorosewater> they used a little too much flour in the mix, no baking powder
[2:14:12] <xxHungryxx> It's like magic can be dangerous or something? 🤔
[2:14:19] <%angryoptimist> A little bit of New Londo, a little bit of Izalith?
[2:14:21] <+alphonseisbest> BUT T-1000S ARE COOL THO
[2:14:24] <rosabellamelantha> What actually killed them is
[2:14:27] <jubejube56> One of them was walking around teamed up with a slime earlier
[2:14:29] <rosabellamelantha> really interesting
[2:14:30] <+Missinglink91> is pat going strength+faith?
[2:14:31] <%luftraumm1> why is that an ORB curch?
[2:14:33] <%AyotoCorp> MIMIC TIME BABY WOO
[2:14:37] <jbrachob> Graace hole!
[2:14:41] <%Kevlar_Caviar> @rosabellamelantha me :)
[2:14:42] <Maids4lyfe> it means don't try to build your own god
[2:14:54] <gentlemanboxer> bawkOmega
[2:14:54] <%MaybeFalco> when i came down here i was so hoping that the grace hole itself was actually a mimic
[2:14:56] <mak0t0yukii> What the fuuuu
[2:14:58] <ergulor> pat jr
[2:14:59] <%dekkitout> This is getting outta hand, there's two of him
[2:15:01] <xxHungryxx> Pat's son
[2:15:03] <FeralFozzie> double pat build
[2:15:04] <Scorilla> now this, but with bleed and bloodflame blade
[2:15:08] <Tempmael> prepare for trouble
[2:15:09] <mak0t0yukii> It's just a ditto summon
[2:15:10] <+phtevenfry> what if it wasn't a grace but a giant lantern fish
[2:15:13] <TheHotStuven> YEYEYEYE
[2:15:17] <penitentpendant> And spells!
[2:15:18] <%dekkitout> I'm told it uses items too
[2:15:18] <%BallerSwagBro9k> Hes powerful but kinda squishy
[2:15:20] <mak0t0yukii> It's just a pokemon
[2:15:22] <%Niney_Who> HE USED POWER WITHIN
[2:15:22] <gentlemanboxer> bawkKek bawkKek
[2:15:23] <+Shimano232> he even casts spells
[2:15:25] <%AyotoCorp> AND your spells
[2:15:25] <%BallerSwagBro9k> AND SPELLS
[2:15:25] <skagtheprinceofhell> And it doewsn't cost YOU mana. Aweseom
[2:15:27] <morkelebmink> this is super broken
[2:15:27] <%Niney_Who> he has ALL your spells
[2:15:27] <+Shimano232> like heals
[2:15:27] <+tizziks> that was unupgraded...
[2:15:27] <+Nomenanza> Mimic's biggest downside is it having same HP as you iirc
[2:15:28] <%MaybeFalco> he'll use items too
[2:15:28] <psychoskull> my mimic keep doing move i dint know i could do
[2:15:30] <%JustTheGuyYouNeed> he uses everything you have
[2:15:31] <jbrachob> UPGRADE TIME
[2:15:31] <rosabellamelantha> @PatStaresAt he has one flask too
[2:15:33] <+Fenrisulfr_V> It's you, but with INFINITE FP.
[2:15:33] <sirrice77> it uses whatever you have skills, spells, all of it
[2:15:34] <%tetraes> if u upgrade him it gets cray
[2:15:36] <dante_must_die_exe> he uses whatever you had equipped when you summon them LU
[2:15:36] <MaritimeSpanker> dude
[2:15:36] <GhostPyre> whatever loadout you have it has
[2:15:37] <%justcallmebobplease> So it's just 'what if you had yourself as a co-op buddy', without any of the network hassling?
[2:15:37] <dante_must_die_exe> LUL
[2:15:39] <%Deft_Thought> Friendship ended with Oleg, now MIMIC is my new best friend
[2:15:39] <+austinj24> He just power within
[2:15:39] <chowndawg> summon him with your talisman out
[2:15:40] <%justcallmebobplease> THAT IS FUCKING LIT
[2:15:41] <%VictorVonLouche> You can get the mimic to only cast spells by making sure it only has a staff equipped before summoning etc
[2:15:41] <MaritimeSpanker> you could summon mimic
[2:15:41] <XxMoliciousxX> it has UNLIMITED FP btw
[2:15:41] <%greasypete00> he can heal himself too
[2:15:43] <MaritimeSpanker> THEN OLEG
[2:15:43] <HyperionXV> It uses your equipped items, copies of your flasks, copies of your spells, copis of equipped consumables
[2:15:44] <penitentpendant> Bye Oleg, g'luck in Woolie's streams
[2:15:44] <+SpiritRoads> finally, Pat 2
[2:15:45] <GhostPyre> talismans, art of war, everything
[2:15:45] <+extantCadence> Do you think they came up with the mimic tear summon first, or the boss?
[2:15:52] <+chaggles> he can use your spells to heal himself
[2:15:55] <FeralFozzie> and my axe
[2:15:55] <+5Two> Soul of the Blood of the Pat
[2:15:55] <%Bluwizard21> @PatStaresAt At +10 he's better than you
[2:15:56] <tanarath> He has your spells, ye
[2:15:56] <+Fenrisulfr_V> At +10, it has around 4.5k HP and INFINITE FP.
[2:15:57] <femto216> Pontiff had one
[2:15:59] <%mofuceo> Plz stop praying for my mimic he is becoming too powerful.
[2:15:59] <+Fetrigon> have you already defeated radhann?
[2:16:00] <+lucky_icarus> I'm pretty sure he can HEAL too but I'm not sure
[2:16:04] <+SpiritRoads> can summon goopat now
[2:16:04] <sirrice77> So you can actually equip only a talisman and one spell and i think they'll spam it
[2:16:08] <SubjectX07x> Mimic tear is DUMBY busted.
[2:16:14] <%BallerSwagBro9k> @penitentpendant Well...not until he gets him in 2026
[2:16:15] <Shiibbae> Pat finally has a clone of himself
[2:16:15] <+phtevenfry> I wonder what'll happen if you summon him with OP equipment you don't have the stats for
[2:16:17] <Shiibbae> God have mercy
[2:16:23] <%AyotoCorp> Did Pat find the ghostwort bells
[2:16:27] <+Jeshk0> more like NOleg
[2:16:27] <+Walopoh> o7
[2:16:27] <+LandOfTheWay> @PatStaresAt what was that dialogue option with rodericka?
[2:16:29] <%TurtlesAndTentacles> These Hoes aint loyal
[2:16:29] <SubjectX07x> He's the only reason I was able to beat a certain boss.
[2:16:30] <+ZaheerMyHomeBoy> upgrade him more lol
[2:16:32] <%abakkus> broleg retirement at last
[2:16:32] <+5Two> o7

[2:17:05] <SubjectX07x> @MaritimeSpanker You get one summon per fight.
[2:17:07] <Shiibbae> Woolie shall take custody of Broleg
[2:17:08] <jubejube56> Can't believe Pat replaced Broleg with a version of himself
[2:17:09] <+Walopoh> When your boss fires you for a clone of himself :(
[2:17:09] <%BallerSwagBro9k> @penitentpendant IMPOSIBRUUUU KomodoHype
[2:17:11] <Guardiansaiyan> F
[2:17:13] <MaritimeSpanker> aw

[2:17:29] <penitentpendant> @BallerSwagBro9k Ah nope, he backed out to level
[2:17:36] <%Niney_Who> Did you see him try to do the riposte too
[2:17:38] <+zaddyforever> we all knew pat’s narcissism would go too far one day
[2:17:41] <SubjectX07x> The strongest part of mimic tear is it has like, quadruple your HP.
[2:17:48] <+lucky_icarus> @patstaresat since you're benching Oleg. you can probably carry another health estus now instead of an FP one
[2:17:52] <%BallerSwagBro9k> Sadly later bosses become so OP that most summons don't last long......except Kristoff the god
[2:17:53] <+Nomenanza> oh lawd he powering up with power within
[2:17:53] <senfood> WOMBO COMBO
[2:17:54] <%shootbang_exe> wow
[2:17:54] <%MaybeFalco> @PatStaresAt imagine if he had two curved greatswords, you could stagger a boss so fast
[2:17:55] <%Niney_Who> YEAH

[2:18:22] <tri3dgE027> this area seems like a nice Farming spot for Runes, eh?
[2:18:23] <penitentpendant> Finally, the ability to summon yourself in coop
[2:18:26] <ape_hawk> pat, stop playing with yourself
[2:18:27] <%BallerSwagBro9k> a
[2:18:27] <EynoStiles> @patstaresat Can you equip items you cant use, then do the mimic spell, and then switch back to your normal gear?
[2:18:28] <+alphonseisbest> TWO BROS DOING WORK
[2:18:30] <+Based_Moose> Yeah fuck co-op at this point
[2:18:31] <DestroPrime83> my pants ahve flown off my body right now
[2:18:34] <%TheGuesty> your mimic has infinite magic ?!?
[2:18:34] <tri3dgE027> 2000 per transformed mimic kill?
[2:18:34] <+Walopoh> I mean, yeah
[2:18:38] <Scorilla> he also copies your talismans and has an estus
[2:18:44] <+Nomenanza> yeah probably tear is good if you got a weapon with a good costly weapon art since they can spam it infinitely
[2:18:44] <%JustTheGuyYouNeed> There is one summon that can deal more damage than you
[2:18:48] <gentlemanboxer> Go mimic
[2:18:53] <%BallerSwagBro9k> You can make some broken ass Mimic Tear builds I'll tell ya what
[2:18:54] <jubejube56> Well they were trying to make something as strong as an elden lord
[2:18:54] <%greasypete00> now if you fuck him is it masturbation
[2:18:54] <+ZaheerMyHomeBoy> how much more do you need to upgrade him?
[2:18:54] <SubjectX07x> @PatStaresAt At max level he does about the same damage as you and has like 4 times the HP, it's insane.
[2:18:57] <+Fenrisulfr_V> 1/3 damage, full status effect.
[2:18:57] <penitentpendant> I'm told giving it an AoE heal gets silly
[2:18:57] <%tetraes> with dual bleed katanas u chunk obsssses with mimic
[2:18:58] <%strakillias> But how much health does he have to tank bosses for you?
[2:19:00] <jubejube56> which presumably you will be at some point
[2:19:00] <NewWillinium> Out of curiosity Pat, have you touched the Crafting Mechanics of the game at all? Like the Cook book items and the like?

[2:29:05] <+ATorL> the last time it happened I was watching another streamer and it kicked up both at the same time
[2:29:10] <+tizziks> wait, was that a centipede on the ground?

[2:30:24] <MaritimeSpanker> they come from the lands of Ashina
[2:30:26] <sirrice77> Is that why when you found a centipede in your house you threw away all your cans? because of the madness?
[2:30:28] <jubejube56> When has a centipede ever been good?
[2:30:31] <+zaddyforever> i think goldmask leads down the int/faith path?

[2:31:44] <%MaybeFalco> he ded
[2:31:46] <+aaymon86> Imagine if there was mimic Grace

[2:32:08] <+aaymon86> That's thr beauty of Elden Ring. You can always come back later!
[2:32:09] <%shootbang_exe> I don't remember the next boss being too hard?
[2:32:18] <SubjectX07x> @PatStaresAt Honestly, possibly even a bit more than that still.
[2:32:19] <%Bluwizard21> @PatStaresAt This boss leads to a whole new area that is one of the best grinding spots in the game
[2:32:19] <%BallerSwagBro9k> Try 60%
[2:32:29] <jubejube56> Yeah the blood lord is still looming
[2:32:33] <+ATorL> Yeah but why leave when you can be miserable on what's in front of you right now
[2:32:34] <%BallerSwagBro9k> Hell maybe 70
[2:32:39] <@Spydurman> considering who Pat has beaten already I'm hard pressed to think any boss will give him real difficulty
[2:32:45] <+stellarseeker> That's the first behind the waterfall trick in the entire game so far
[2:32:48] <penitentpendant> Fingers: "Oh? You want to dethrone us?"

[2:33:21] <Wakerz140> Incorrect
[2:33:25] <ChuckDMarmot> Pat seems to be between 1 and 99% done with the game.
[2:33:26] <+Edrem> you get it back way way later
[2:33:27] <Wakerz140> You *can* get it back
[2:33:28] <+Based_Moose> HAND IT OVER

[2:33:45] <$zyberion626> hug lady?
[2:33:46] <%justcallmebobplease> Fia the Deathbed Companion, the hug lady.
[2:33:46] <+Kyma1020> deathbed companion
[2:33:48] <pi_in_the_sci> fia is hug lady
[2:33:48] <rosabellamelantha> SHE IS

[2:33:51] <%Kevlar_Caviar> no her quest is super rad

[2:33:54] <senfood> No, she's nice.
[2:33:54] <@Fuggins4U> psaCrazyhead_SG
[2:33:55] <%Nekros4442> yes she is
[2:33:57] <%TurtlesAndTentacles> NO SHE GREAT lol
[2:33:57] <+phtevenfry> look at her, she doesn't have any armor, give it
[2:34:08] <+Kyma1020> he kills her
[2:34:10] <SubjectX07x> Don't give armor.
[2:34:12] <%AsherCaelum> He kills Fia at the end of her quest if you give him the armor.
[2:34:12] <+ConnieETC> It’s for fia ending
[2:34:13] <$vehementvadr> feeda on these nuts, gottem
[2:34:15] <%tetraes> She does have a Rad  bossfight ifd u do her quest
[2:34:16] <%discoinfierno> that's why she's cool
[2:34:16] <%BallerSwagBro9k> He kills Fia fir killing her brother
[2:34:19] <+Nomenanza> No
[2:34:19] <%Nekros4442> d2 kills fia you get to loot fia and get her and d's armor back iirc
[2:34:20] <SubjectX07x> It will lock you out of Fia's shit, and fia's shit is dope.
[2:34:20] <%luftraumm1> mybe clear her quest first?
[2:34:21] <%Kevlar_Caviar> NOPE
[2:34:21] <Wakerz140> If you give him the armor he kills fia at the end of her questline, you don't get the armor back unless you kill him later too
[2:34:21] <jman13131313> yes
[2:34:23] <%bundle_of_herbs> take the centipede
[2:34:24] <+Kyma1020> yes
[2:34:26] <%BallerSwagBro9k> An ending
[2:34:27] <+Nomenanza> He kills her after the end of the quest
[2:34:27] <+LandOfTheWay> @PatStaresAt give the armor to that dude, D's brother, and he kills her at the end of Fia's questline
[2:34:29] <%Kevlar_Caviar> her quest is FAR from done
[2:34:29] <%JustTheGuyYouNeed> he kills her after the ending of her quest
[2:34:30] <+Kyma1020> a sick boss fight
[2:34:31] <rosabellamelantha> @PatStaresAt if you give him the armour he will kill fia after you find her and then give you his sword and the armour, this locks you out of her ending but you're doing ranni rn anyway
[2:34:33] <+Shimano232> This is D's brother who gets upset when you give it to him. I have never gotten it back yet without killing him.
[2:34:33] <+ConnieETC> You can give it and still do her quest
[2:34:38] <SubjectX07x> An ending option and Fia's got cool bosses.
[2:34:44] <+alphonseisbest> mark on map
[2:34:44] <%TurtlesAndTentacles> Mark him?
[2:34:51] <EynoStiles> Pat, can your mimic spell copy whatever weapon you have equip even if you cant use it
[2:34:52] <oda_flobunaga> Time for reference
[2:34:52] <+alphonseisbest> YO
[2:34:54] <%luftraumm1> thats aboss arena
[2:34:55] <sirrice77> Just give him the armor after fias quest
[2:34:56] <%justcallmebobplease> There is a Fia ending, basically, so you can miss out on that... but that ending obviously doesn't mesh with OTHER endings.
[2:34:57] <%MaybeFalco> oh wow i super fucked up then, i gave him he armor
[2:35:01] <+LandOfTheWay> @PatStaresAt fia's quest will already be done when he kills her, and i think you get some stuff for it
[2:35:06] <radiorosewater> map mep mape meppe
[2:35:08] <SubjectX07x> @EynoStiles Yes, it can.
[2:35:09] <lyzejag> I can confirm Pat, i did the Fia quest first THEN Ranni
[2:35:12] <radiorosewater> C H O E S E
[2:35:13] <+ConnieETC> She dies after her quest finished but you won’t get armour back for awhile
[2:35:25] <+SilverDevilfish> Fia's ending is lame anyway
[2:35:28] <%JustTheGuyYouNeed> You can give it later no problem
[2:35:31] <EynoStiles> @subjectx07x You tested it!
[2:35:32] <penitentpendant> Yup
[2:35:33] <%MaybeFalco> IT SURE IS
[2:35:34] <SubjectX07x> It do be.
[2:35:34] <+ATorL> YES
[2:35:34] <SilverBrass> LUL
[2:35:35] <rosabellamelantha> Fia's ending SUCKS
[2:35:36] <oda_flobunaga> Time FOR REFERENCE
[2:35:37] <%JustTheGuyYouNeed> you did not miss the quest
[2:35:38] <%TurtlesAndTentacles> It's Lexington lol
[2:35:38] <rosabellamelantha> like for real
[2:35:40] <%BallerSwagBro9k> @landoftheway If she doesn't die she unlocks an ending
[2:35:41] <%luftraumm1> oooo i heard some shit abt this bitch
[2:35:43] <+ATorL> HAVE FUN
[2:35:44] <%dekkitout> Is... is it not a gargoyle?
[2:35:45] <darce_avidson> :)
[2:35:46] <penitentpendant> Where's the second one, THERE'S NEVER ONE
[2:35:51] <oda_flobunaga> @PatStaresAt 1 question, how many?
[2:35:52] <%MaybeFalco> ARE YOU READY FOR ANOR LONDO PAT?
[2:35:54] <%AsherCaelum> Oh good, it's just the one.
[2:36:00] <+LandOfTheWay> @BallerSwagBro9k the ending is unlocked prior to her dying, i thought
[2:36:01] <darce_avidson> @rosabellamelantha Not as bad as a certain dung ending
[2:36:01] <%BallerSwagBro9k> Kappa Kappa Kappa Kappa
[2:36:02] <SubjectX07x> @EynoStiles I have indeed, it will use whatever weapon you have equipped at the time and nothing else, same with spells.
[2:36:08] <%BallerSwagBro9k> psaCrazyhand psaCrazyhead psaCrazy
[2:36:10] <+ATorL> yeah it sure can be worse
[2:36:10] <ebrion> Blunt damage?
[2:36:13] <+ConnieETC> @ballerswagbro9k you just need the item from her, she can still die
[2:36:19] <lyzejag> Yeah it sure does
[2:36:24] <+ATorL> not even the half of it yet
[2:36:26] <Maids4lyfe> LUL
[2:36:31] <EynoStiles> @subjectx07x Thats really strong.
[2:36:32] <rosabellamelantha> @rosabellamelantha Literally every ending but frenzy flame and age of stars is lame as fuck
[2:36:40] <darce_avidson> funny how there supposedly is an ending people haven't figured out how to get yet
[2:36:43] <%tetraes> u pretty much get nothing for giving the armor
[2:36:51] <%Kevlar_Caviar> @PatStaresAt iirc fia's quest and ranni's quest can both be done in one run but only if you do the steps in a specific order
[2:36:55] <hermitdab> shit confirmed as worse
[2:36:56] <%BallerSwagBro9k> @landoftheway IDK when he killed her, her ending didnt unlock for me.....maybe a bug
[2:36:59] <Maids4lyfe> no spoilers please
[2:37:01] <rosabellamelantha> You get his sword and the armour back
[2:37:02] <sirrice77> @tetraes you get the armor back and a sword
[2:37:02] <%luftraumm1> all gargoyles are pat
[2:37:02] <%Deft_Thought> I mean
[2:37:06] <%BallerSwagBro9k> I mean......theyre gargoyles
[2:37:07] <%Deft_Thought> They're Gargoyles
[2:37:08] <SubjectX07x> @EynoStiles That's not even mentioning that it has like quadruple your HP and at max level does comparable damage to you too.
[2:37:11] <%dekkitout> As opposed to free range, organic gargoyles
[2:37:13] <EynoStiles> @subjectx07x You can make some cool stuff
[2:37:13] <%TurtlesAndTentacles> Imagine if he had Oleg lol
[2:37:20] <penitentpendant> The gargoyles look part stone, part bone
[2:37:28] <%BallerSwagBro9k> @dekkitout LUL
[2:37:35] <+LandOfTheWay> @BallerSwagBro9k just confirmed it; you get the item from fia that unlocks her ending, then D's brother shows up to kill her. you can then get fia's armor and D's armor back back by killing the brother
[2:37:36] <EynoStiles> @subjectx07x I wish we could get pat to see. lol
[2:37:37] <digaogrunge> You mean a sculpture is manufactured?
[2:37:41] <%BallerSwagBro9k> Bonk
[2:37:45] <sirrice77> @penitentpendant the orange parts are corpse wax
[2:37:52] <hermitdab> have poison heals on deck
[2:37:55] <Ekaelis> I miss DS1 Gargoyles LUL
[2:37:58] <rosabellamelantha> yes
[2:38:00] <+LandOfTheWay> yes
[2:38:03] <+aaymon86> The Gargoyles series made us believe they're real
[2:38:05] <+ConnieETC> Yes
[2:38:06] <%BallerSwagBro9k> Apparently yes
[2:38:12] <SubjectX07x> @PatStaresAt He wants you to use the Mimic tear and try to use weapons you don't have the ability to use when you summon it.
[2:38:12] <+ConnieETC> Just you won’t get d armour back for awhile
[2:38:12] <EynoStiles> the mimic can copy even weapons you cant equip
[2:38:16] <penitentpendant> Off your back
[2:38:17] <+Nomenanza> btw dont even have to kill the bro, he kills himself and drops both the armour and his sword if you rest at grace
[2:38:29] <+ConnieETC> ^
[2:38:41] <DestroPrime83> hairy back
[2:38:44] <SubjectX07x> @EynoStiles I'm not sure about weapons you CAN'T equip, just that it will copy whatever you have.
[2:38:49] <darce_avidson> huh didn't know that
[2:38:57] <darce_avidson> assumed he'd disappear, so i killed him
[2:38:58] <SubjectX07x> Though I can easily test that right now lol.
[2:39:05] <%luftraumm1> cleanrot helm?
[2:39:05] <%matf8> more hair on you back than on your head
[2:39:14] <%TurtlesAndTentacles> But...No Cape
[2:39:18] <+Nomenanza> oh you dont get the cape?
[2:39:20] <+LandOfTheWay> @PatStaresAt like someone else just said, you don't actually even need to kill D's brother; just talk to him and reload the area to get his armor back
[2:39:35] <%BallerSwagBro9k> Doesnt matter in the end Ranni ending best ending
[2:39:41] <Sgt_Wigglytuff> it's the best part you mad man
[2:39:41] <calmsoul689> pat would look so cool with wolf armor set
[2:39:51] <%MaybeFalco> this is a really rough fight
[2:39:51] <EynoStiles> You need a hammer. im guessing
[2:39:51] <SubjectX07x> YES
[2:39:55] <rosabellamelantha> @PatStaresAt you get the choice like DS3
[2:39:59] <calmsoul689> yes
[2:40:00] <%BallerSwagBro9k> Kinda
[2:40:00] <+LandOfTheWay> sort of, yes
[2:40:01] <%TurtlesAndTentacles> The Cape looks that ugly?
[2:40:04] <penitentpendant> It's like DS3's ending
[2:40:05] <%tetraes> @BallerSwagBro9k  You mean Lord of Frenzy Flame
[2:40:05] <+ConnieETC> Yea
[2:40:06] <TheBlankAce> You get obvious choices
[2:40:07] <darce_avidson> Choice of ending occurs after bosses
[2:40:08] <SubjectX07x> I can confirm yes you will at the very end have the choice to select who to end with.
[2:40:10] <+LandOfTheWay> you can fight all the bosses, then choose
[2:40:13] <penitentpendant> A final choice after a boss
[2:40:18] <sirrice77> @PatStaresAt you beat final boss and have a choice EXCEPT the frenzy flame ending LOCKS you in when you unlock it
[2:40:21] <%BallerSwagBro9k> Only one ending locks u out of the others
[2:40:25] <+Edrem> @PatStaresAt apart from the frenzy flames ending, which locks you off from everything else and has VERY clear points of no return
[2:40:29] <rosabellamelantha> @PatStaresAt One of the endings HARD LOCKS YOU however
[2:40:33] <$EsotericOdyssey> it's a choice like after the final boss
[2:40:38] <darce_avidson> Frenzy flame you can actually get out of
[2:40:45] <$EsotericOdyssey> yeah be warned though one ending hard locks you
[2:40:46] <%JustTheGuyYouNeed> Only one end locks you out, but you can reverse it anyway
[2:40:51] <darce_avidson> however it requires killing 2 optional superbosses
[2:40:52] <$EsotericOdyssey> unless you take steps before it
[2:40:54] <$EsotericOdyssey> to undo it
[2:40:57] <+LandOfTheWay> @PatStaresAt that said, one ending WILL lock you in unless you get a specific item to undo it
[2:40:57] <%justcallmebobplease> YOUR MIMIC JUST DRANK
[2:40:58] <sirrice77> Oh you can?
[2:40:59] <%justcallmebobplease> SO BUSTED
[2:41:04] <$EsotericOdyssey> but if you go into final boss without fixing it you're hard locked
[2:41:09] <%Kevlar_Caviar> @PatStaresAt one ending path that you're really far from starting locks you in, but it's possible to go back from it
[2:41:10] <DracaenaLeaf> who sais that
[2:41:11] <oda_flobunaga> And then there were 2
[2:41:13] <darce_avidson> Yeah mimic is the best in the game
[2:41:14] <%TurtlesAndTentacles> Chat does the mimic have Estus?!
[2:41:17] <darce_avidson> especially when upgraded
[2:41:21] <TheBlankAce> You probably got locked out of the one ending you get hard locked on by that one invader not spawning though.
[2:41:22] <%BallerSwagBro9k> Yeah you're not gonna lock yourself out of endings. The one ending that locks u out takes forever to reach
[2:41:23] <%Deft_Thought> Does the Mimic health scale with your health or with levels?
[2:41:24] <%VictorVonLouche> yes
[2:41:31] <calmsoul689> darksouls reference at it
[2:41:31] <SubjectX07x> @PatStaresAt The only exception to this rule is that the frenzied flame ending is a HARD lock and will deny you from choosing your ending. However if you do proc the frenzied flame ending by accident there is a way to cure it, and it involves multiple optional VERY difficult bosses.
[2:41:31] <+flexin_apex> Anyone know how many hrs pat got in this game ?
[2:41:33] <lyzejag> Gargoyles (Again)
[2:41:34] <+ATorL> the poison breath is what makes this fight so awful
[2:41:37] <%luftraumm1> combo
[2:41:37] <rosabellamelantha> levels
[2:41:42] <darce_avidson> @Deft_Thought both
[2:41:59] <%TurtlesAndTentacles> Chat is there a Dragon summon?
[2:42:02] <+LandOfTheWay> then no worries, you can do all the bosses
[2:42:03] <penitentpendant> As much content as possible~
[2:42:07] <%BallerSwagBro9k> All endings have the same Boss I think
[2:42:08] <darce_avidson> since it definitely increased health when i respecced for more health
[2:42:09] <rosabellamelantha> @PatStaresAt Melina also literally warns you multiple times before you do Frenzied Flame so you know
[2:42:13] <SubjectX07x> When I say very difficult I mean VERY, VERY, difficult for one of them.
[2:42:18] <darce_avidson> and definitely at least gets tankier
[2:42:45] <penitentpendant> Praise the Vit!
[2:42:50] <+extantCadence> Once the second gargoyle shows up, they can be really brutal if they decide to swing their weapons at the same time
[2:43:15] <%TurtlesAndTentacles> Im surpised Pat hasnt call Jelly Jam
[2:43:17] <%BallerSwagBro9k> @rosabellamelantha Friendfied Flame ending is Dead Cells prequel Kappa
[2:43:26] <%MaybeFalco> @SubjectX07x more difficult than a certain evergaol?
[2:43:30] <oda_flobunaga> I ended up cheesing this with Blood slash
[2:43:47] <EynoStiles> @subjectx07x Did you try the thing with mimic?
[2:43:50] <tinytinykittycat> Just keep punching him in the dick
[2:43:52] <SubjectX07x> @MaybeFalco Possibly the most difficult fucking boss ever put into a soulsborne game.

[2:46:22] <darce_avidson> @oda_flobunaga ms. blood sucker
[2:46:39] <zhenthrim213> dude the clawmark seal is SO GOOD
[2:46:43] <oda_flobunaga> Ah
[2:46:46] <Midnight188> ironmouse had 11mins left earlier now its an hour 45. how do ppl have the money to spend on this???
[2:47:44] <tanarath> Investment, real estate speculation, soulless tech jobs, etc.
[2:47:47] <Midnight188> how do ppl just donate like 5000 gift subs....wild
[2:48:04] <$Cthulos> Big audience?
[2:48:10] <+LandOfTheWay> @zhenthrim213 as i understand it, the clawmark is best for if you've invest hard in strength and have only a little faith, right?
[2:48:48] <tanarath> Also having a massive audience.
[2:49:00] <%TheAdMerlin> I didn't know Pat watched Ironmouse, and yet it makes sense
[2:49:06] <tanarath> She has 16k viewing currently
[2:49:17] <Midnight188> sorry two hours 36 mins another 750 gift subs....vtuber fans are another beast
[2:49:42] <zhenthrim213> @LandOfTheWay yea its great for my dark knight build
[2:49:43] <+GreyJumbo> mimic goin hard lol
[2:50:05] <penitentpendant> Yeah, the animation lock is real risky here
[2:50:06] <%SlimmieP> Mimic goin in got him to half health damn
[2:50:17] <SubjectX07x> You always summon mimic at fight start, pop the heal then begin
[2:50:29] <+LandOfTheWay> @zhenthrim213 sweet, i'll probably wind up using it for my build since i wanna go Big Strength for one
[2:50:33] <Midnight188> yo storm ruler?!?!?!
[2:50:36] <+LandOfTheWay> *once
[2:50:37] <DestroPrime83> @Midnight188 i mean some guy named Zynnith spent 2000 on one of chillchaos' streams
[2:50:50] <SubjectX07x> Now if I could just find a spot to summon mine to test this thing damn it, lol.
[2:51:00] <Matrixvingian> DubaGoyle
[2:51:07] <EynoStiles> Pat can the mimic copy a hammer even if you cant equip it?
[2:51:11] <%Kevlar_Caviar> monkaS
[2:51:11] <Midnight188> @DestroPrime83 thats whack. i cant imagine spending that much on sometihng like that.
[2:51:12] <zhenthrim213> @LandOfTheWay  yea it also boost beast incantions
[2:51:14] <Matrixvingian> Like Bayonetta Angles?
[2:51:16] <%dekkitout> They're homunculi?
[2:51:20] <%MaybeFalco> its like they were grafted together
[2:51:21] <darce_avidson> mimic + dual uchi with a frost weapon on one of them absolutely ruin bosses
[2:51:30] <darce_avidson> frost art of war
[2:51:34] <+ATorL> no they're like corpses with stuff graphed to them
[2:51:38] <jubejube56> Why do gargoyle's get to do transformation attacks but not us?
[2:51:45] <+alphonseisbest> yo Woolie JUST unlock the spell lady
[2:51:51] <+ATorL> yeah the poison is bullshit
[2:52:00] <+alphonseisbest> that gurl is kinda hiden huh
[2:52:07] <%MaybeFalco> yeah that poison is fucking lethal here
[2:52:14] <DestroPrime83> @Midnight188 yeah Zynnith and Notacop spend hundreds to almost a thousand dollars on Chilleds stream almost every day
[2:52:15] <+GreyJumbo> alienl4Stare
[2:52:17] <%BallerSwagBro9k> Dont u mean Runes? Kappa Kappa Kappa Kappa Kappa
[2:52:24] <+ATorL> the poison is what shreds summons and makes the entire fight so hard
[2:52:27] <@Fuggins4U> the rhyme with big was right there
[2:52:28] <sirrice77> yeah, i think its unfair to spellcasters that their trainer is hidden when the faith one isnt
[2:52:36] <+ATorL> without the poison I think it would be tolerable
[2:53:02] <Midnight188> man gief looks like he's dense...like a big ol barrel of bulk
[2:53:04] <%MaybeFalco> i came back later for this fight, its just really tough, especially with the other gargoyle coming in
[2:53:07] <EynoStiles> @atorl What if you have the mimic copy poison resist gear?
[2:53:13] <samsaric_prisoner> Wait for it...
[2:53:25] <penitentpendant> That's some BAD breath
[2:53:28] <rommlll> o hey just in time
[2:53:34] <%BallerSwagBro9k> @sirrice77 Lore wise it makes sense tho since the Academy rebelled against the empire and waged war against them
[2:53:35] <@Fuggins4U> bulk babe
[2:53:41] <sun312772> LUL LUL LUL LUL
[2:53:46] <mazzaroo> mazzar2Uwu
[2:54:03] <hermitdab> i'm 10 hours in and still haven't found spell casting ability/npc
[2:54:08] <Midnight188> all love is drawn into him like a neutron star but dog shaped
[2:54:14] <+ATorL> @EynoStiles it's not the poison status that's the problem, it's the pool of poison juice doing direct damge
[2:54:15] <+flexin_apex> These boss designs are amazing
[2:54:24] <Midnight188> gief isnt fat, he's just bulking yknow?
[2:54:41] <EynoStiles> @atorl got it
[2:55:34] <sun312772> summon jelly
[2:55:50] <+ATorL> if it was one boss with the poison that might also be fine, but when you get both of them able to do it you inevitably get times when they both poison pool at the same time
[2:55:55] <%BallerSwagBro9k> @patstaresat If I recall correctly the Magic Dragon Breath hurt them a lot
[2:56:01] <hermitdab> yes for distraction and doesnt drain the magic meter
[2:56:03] <+ATorL> like one of my attempts I had them sandwich me between poison pools
[2:56:03] <jubejube56> They are spewing poison aren't they?
[2:56:21] <+ATorL> the jelly will still get shreded
[2:56:59] <+KratzTv89> would hammer waepon work better like the crystal people on the stone guys
[2:57:05] <%Mantorok06> Bonk
[2:57:07] <oda_flobunaga> This one took a while
[2:57:14] <ebrion> Its a rock, blunt and magic?
[2:57:14] <+alphonseisbest> heh
[2:57:15] <+Javaa01> Yeah he's rock hard, there ain't no fleshy bits to rot there
[2:57:16] <%jamsbybetty> summon Lhutel, she's a teleporting tank that's good at getting aggro from range
[2:57:16] <jubejube56> does a lot but the queen's black flame did way more
[2:57:17] <EynoStiles> he doesnt like that
[2:57:20] <%greasypete00> oleg also doesnt rip your hp down
[2:57:23] <Druss_M> The army of Greatshield skeletons though
[2:57:27] <noot_art> How
[2:57:31] <%Mantorok06> Mimic is good only at max level i think
[2:57:33] <+Fetrigon> creepy49Bigblush oh yea...
[2:57:35] <SubjectX07x> Definitely recommend buffing the mimic more when you get the chance though, it is definitely top tier.
[2:57:38] <jubejube56> The mimic can heal itself, it just needs to not stand in poison
[2:57:39] <+fangking1414> mimic seems like dps vs olegs tank
[2:57:39] <%KratzTv89> KratzTv89 subscribed with Prime. 
[2:57:40] <calmsoul689> do you need help pat? should we don our armor and help you?
[2:57:45] <+alphonseisbest> Oleg can keep going longer than pat, someone let paige know Kappa
[2:57:45] <Happydisaster> Oleg better
[2:57:48] <digaogrunge> A well timed Black Flame attack did the most dmg so far
[2:57:56] <%MaybeFalco> LUL
[2:57:59] <+Beetlewins> do you have an upgraded strike weapon?
[2:58:02] <hermitdab> bird up

[2:58:02] <%greasypete00> hell get in dont worry
[2:58:02] <%dekkitout> tajWHY
[2:58:03] <SubjectX07x> The mimic does get one or two flasks to heal to.
[2:58:03] <%BallerSwagBro9k> Hawk is squishy

[2:59:48] <+GreyJumbo> I like the ancestral follower, just snipes from afar
[2:59:57] <Druss_M> dedleg
[2:59:59] <%luftraumm1> yeah i think mimic is still goat
[3:00:02] <+Fenrisulfr_V> @PatStaresAt The mimic has a single Estus, Oleg doesn't.
[3:00:06] <+ATorL> the poison is going to destroy basically any summon you use
[3:00:07] <Guardiansaiyan> OLEG, work for that job security!!!!
[3:00:10] <slimslimjim88> Go leg go!
[3:00:13] <+ATorL> mimic can at least heal itself
[3:00:14] <plaguedoctor_vi> i am trying my best boss
[3:00:18] <Hunk_Of_Dunk> Hey, just watched the last vod to the end, what cool shit have I missed THIS stream?
[3:00:21] <oda_flobunaga> NOleg
[3:00:29] <%BallerSwagBro9k> U need Kristoff
[3:00:34] <hermitdab> broleg
[3:00:35] <Guardiansaiyan> @Hunk_Of_Dunk Oleg retired
[3:00:39] <%Mantorok06> Time to take Oleg out behind the shed
[3:01:07] <%MaybeFalco> oleg can go look at the rabbits
[3:01:08] <%luftraumm1> @Hunk_Of_Dunk Nokron, mimics that copy pat, and crucible knights flying to their deaths
[3:01:17] <@Fuggins4U> i dont think the summons are the problem here psaCrazyhead_SG psaCrazyhead_SG
[3:01:19] <EynoStiles> You did defeat the first one, so boss is do able
[3:01:27] <+leviting> you know who's better than Oleg? you, but again
[3:01:27] <slimslimjim88> Ole G eezer
[3:01:31] <+extantCadence> I always did my summon at around 55-60% and try to get as much damage as possible before the second joined the fray
[3:01:39] <HyperionXV> Have you tried out that greatshield soldier squad summon yet?
[3:01:42] <Zourath> Friendship ended with Oleg, now Mimic is best friend
[3:01:52] <%luftraumm1> @Fuggins4U we in the "git gud" land now
[3:02:10] <$Surion84> dude how do you beat radhan
[3:02:17] <$Surion84> I'm getting clapped
[3:02:22] <%Mantorok06> Mimic-kun, you're my only friend
[3:02:29] <+ATorL> @HyperionXV I tried that and the first pool of poison killed three of them right away
[3:02:34] <roguemephilesclone> These bosses are rad.
[3:02:40] <%greasypete00> and people will still probably say O&S is harder
[3:02:49] <SubjectX07x> @Surion84 Never stop not summoning otherwise, could password up and I could try n help a homie out.
[3:02:59] <femto216> Is this a mandatory boss?
[3:03:02] <Ekaelis> @greasypete00 They were better designed
[3:03:06] <SubjectX07x> I am on PC however.
[3:03:16] <$Surion84> same
[3:03:28] <oda_flobunaga> @PatStaresAt if you stay nearer to the fog door, it takes longer for the second Gargoyle to get to you.  You'll have more time to kill the first one unmolested.
[3:03:28] <%Mantorok06> We do bosses for the clout baybee
[3:03:31] <$Captainahab_37> oh more of these guys are in this game then, uh oh
[3:03:36] <$Captainahab_37> gank gargoyles D:
[3:03:45] <%tetraes> Skeletons are pretty Boss
[3:04:00] <jubejube56> I feel like you'll only really have a shot if you can spam the queen flame once it hits 50%
[3:04:08] <+alphonseisbest> awww Pat with the self love
[3:04:13] <+alphonseisbest> ya <£ to see it
[3:04:15] <+alphonseisbest> <3
[3:04:17] <%TurtlesAndTentacles> Poor Oleg
[3:04:31] <Hunk_Of_Dunk> Oh yeah, this is the step of ranni's quest after radahn too, innit?
[3:04:34] <+alphonseisbest> Oleg scmoleg
[3:04:41] <%Pyon84> Is it just me or do pure melee builds seem kinda not good in this game?
[3:04:52] <sirrice77> actually you don't need to do this boss to continue ranni
[3:04:55] <eos_sg> has he upgraded the mimic?
[3:05:08] <$Solid_Stro> Mimic chan
[3:05:16] <%greasypete00> may need to come back with an upgraded mimic if you decide to leave these guys for later
[3:05:16] <zhenthrim213> so
[3:05:19] <Hunk_Of_Dunk> Really? that's surprising, I figured this was the main boss of this area
[3:05:25] <+extantCadence> The poison aoe ticks for so much damage that it really tears through any summon
[3:05:25] <Midnight188> mimic is +4
[3:05:27] <SubjectX07x> Btw, now realizing that Pat has to have fought Radahn, how many attempts did it take him?
[3:05:33] <%Pyon84> @eos_sg Yes he has. +4 last I saw
[3:05:33] <zhenthrim213> ive made it to the ultimate Miyazaki swamp
[3:05:34] <$vehementvadr> time for thun and run
[3:05:36] <+fangking1414> @PatStaresAt do you think if you put a healing incantation on he would use it?
[3:05:42] <%Mantorok06> 4 I think?
[3:05:48] <%Kevlar_Caviar> @SubjectX07x less than 10
[3:05:49] <sirrice77> It is the main boss of this area its just ranni only needs the fingerslaying knife which you find before this boss
[3:05:50] <SubjectX07x> Yes, he would.
[3:05:51] <+ATorL> he can
[3:05:55] <+chaggles> he does
[3:05:55] <$Captainahab_37> i hated that first academy boss
[3:05:57] <+ATorL> he uses items and spells
[3:06:01] <%BallerSwagBro9k> He would
[3:06:07] <+ATorL> so put healing items on your item bar
[3:06:28] <jubejube56> is it possible at all to deal with half the first gargoyle then do a summon and blitz it? It seems like it can't survive if the gargoyle does 2 poison
[3:06:29] <+ATorL> he'll drop those AoE healing stones, for what it's worth
[3:06:55] <$Captainahab_37> i think it'd probably be hard to find a summon window mid-fight
[3:07:25] <%Brassnarwhal> has anyone else been having repeated cloud save errors?
[3:07:28] <%Kevlar_Caviar> YEYEYE
[3:07:34] <%BallerSwagBro9k> YOOOOO
[3:07:38] <%Mantorok06> Mimic chan ran interference
[3:07:40] <EynoStiles> What if you have the mimic equip a shield that way you can buy you moee time to use the dragon breathe
[3:07:41] <%BlondieFDM> This fight is so damn annoying haha
[3:07:43] <%AsherCaelum> @Brassnarwhal Yeah, I've been seeing a lot of posts about them recently.
[3:07:57] <%gitgouda> oh nice your on the gargoyales.
[3:08:00] <+ATorL> this is the hard part because if you choke now you know how hard it is to get back to it
[3:08:02] <%IvanMistwalker> RIP
[3:08:04] <%BlondieFDM> RIP
[3:08:10] <+ATorL> same thing happened to me
[3:08:11] <askinWW> those delays though
[3:08:12] <@Fuggins4U> this fight seems difficult
[3:08:14] <Varanoo> RIP
[3:08:15] <+alphonseisbest> rip
[3:08:16] <%luftraumm1> @PatStaresAt barricade shield perhaps?
[3:08:16] <sun312772> time to learn
[3:08:17] <+Javaa01> @BlondieFDM Yeah honestly most people just get here too early
[3:08:18] <%gitgouda> i did not enjoy this at first.
[3:08:20] <%Brassnarwhal> @ashercaelum last time i only lost like 20 minutes of play but holy shit its scary when i close the game now
[3:08:20] <+ATorL> finally got one down and then fucked up on the second one
[3:08:21] <roguemephilesclone> The "delay those rolls" part of the fight.
[3:08:21] <$Solid_Stro> coxBronze
[3:08:21] <EynoStiles> Pat do you have hammer
[3:08:21] <+gruff_gridof> doodDed
[3:08:24] <%ScreamLord> Can't you resummon the Mimic?
[3:08:26] <oda_flobunaga> I had a really hard time with this but Pat's put that into perspective.  I have an Arcane Blood Build and was spamming Blood Slash for days
[3:08:27] <Grave_Titan_D> rip in peace
[3:08:30] <AgnusLaplace> look on the bright side, at least there aren't 3
[3:08:37] <mike2hands> NotLikeThis lytWAH
[3:08:49] <theloverobot> Just do it good
[3:08:52] <+Javaa01> @BlondieFDM Cause if you are having trouble here, the upcoming zone they are gatekeeping will be unmanageable
[3:08:57] <roguemephilesclone> I would save the summon, these guys seem just slow enough for it.
[3:09:02] <EynoStiles> @agnuslaplace thats a curse if i ever saw one
[3:09:18] <%Brassnarwhal> it's cool that the bell gargoyles got a glow up
[3:09:19] <$Captainahab_37> barricade shield is kick ass
[3:09:20] <%soloshotfirst82> soloshotfirst82 subscribed with Prime. 
[3:09:26] <%shootbang_exe> this fight was stupid easy as a mage using oleg as a distraction
[3:09:31] <travisty_in_motion> stop rolling back, gargoyles punish for not being in crotch.
[3:09:32] <%dekkitout> The huh?
[3:09:35] <$realm_forge> Can we name the mimic Greg?
[3:09:38] <darce_avidson> honestly i love elden ring
[3:09:39] <EynoStiles> But you did it
[3:09:40] <SubjectX07x> I have not seen a single boss fight go above 2 enemies.
[3:09:43] <%Bailey__Gaming> that was a big lad
[3:09:46] <%Brassnarwhal> glad i never finished ds2 lmao
[3:09:48] <darce_avidson> but damn does this game have an issue with duo bosses
[3:09:48] <+ATorL> at least they had the decency to have very low health in DS2
[3:10:03] <%Brassnarwhal> @realm_forge Gregg has 2 g's
[3:10:07] <Midnight188> the mimic's name is Nortap
[3:10:14] <SubjectX07x> @darce_avidson I have only seen like 3 duos?
[3:10:20] <%soloshotfirst82> I'm using my Prime sub because my 3-legged cat has been fascinated by the playthru for the past few days.  He's sitting here watching right now.  Squirtle believes in you, Pat.
[3:10:29] <%Brassnarwhal> it's cool that pat can co-op summon gregg to help with bosses
[3:10:40] <%dekkitout> Gregg could use a heal spell or 2
[3:10:42] <%TurtlesAndTentacles> @Midnight188 I like it!
[3:10:45] <stardustcrusad3r> fuckkkkkkkkk
[3:10:49] <%luftraumm1> pat and greg toghether again
[3:11:01] <SubjectX07x> There are not that many duo fights in this game for the number of bosses there are, though I have missed quite a few mini bosses.
[3:11:03] <+alphonseisbest> @Midnight188 oh THATS good
[3:11:06] <%twistedj3ster> that was bs
[3:11:11] <Midnight188> oh god the mimic's been Norted
[3:11:20] <Ekaelis> You remember Demons in Ringed City? One would be in your face, the other behind and it would have a more ranged moveset and they cycled
[3:11:20] <+alphonseisbest> @soloshotfirst82 pls gib Squirtle lots of pets <3
[3:11:22] <%Brassnarwhal> gregg has 2 g's people
[3:11:23] <%Pyon84> Dodging left on the earth laser seems to work.
[3:11:29] <%ScreamLord> You can't resummon the Mimic?
[3:11:29] <+alphonseisbest> have they?
[3:11:37] <SubjectX07x> @PatStaresAt Frenzied Flame stuff...
[3:11:39] <%Brassnarwhal> @midnight188 no you can't just keep norting people
[3:11:42] <+alphonseisbest> hmmmmm
[3:11:42] <jbrachob> Oh
[3:11:43] <%Brassnarwhal> stop
[3:11:48] <EynoStiles> Your character turn yellow at some point
[3:11:49] <+alphonseisbest> BLUUD
[3:11:50] <$realm_forge> Irl or in game?
[3:11:51] <oda_flobunaga> @PatStaresAt Try to keep the first Gargoyle near the fog gate.  I.E. if it runs away from you don't follow it, let it come back.
[3:11:52] <+ATorL> my character always had yellow eyes, but now she has cat eyes which is really weird
[3:11:57] <%dekkitout> The darkside of the force is a pathway to blah blah
[3:11:57] <Sgt_Wigglytuff> mine are yellow no idea why
[3:12:00] <%Brassnarwhal> that's sick
[3:12:04] <RubberFistFight> @PatStaresAt i get the feeling the fact that you're doing frenzied flame stuff is why vyke won't spawn
[3:12:07] <%soloshotfirst82> @soloshotfirst82 I don't have a choice, he's sitting on my mouse mat.
[3:12:07] <+ATorL> because I'm pretty sure that wasn't an option in creation
[3:12:08] <jubejube56> Is there a summon that could resist the poison breath somehow?
[3:12:18] <%twistedj3ster> I thought they meant irl and I thought mine were the only ones that did that
[3:12:19] <jubejube56> Can you put anti poison gear on for the mimic?
[3:12:26] <SubjectX07x> The frenzied flame stuff is the cause for the flaming blood eyes.
[3:12:28] <%Brassnarwhal> @sgt_wigglytuff have you been using the flame of madness incantations at all?
[3:12:40] <@Fuggins4U> i'm wondering if he should only summon the mimic once the 2nd one shows up
[3:12:47] <roguemephilesclone> As soon as that poison comes out, the summons just can't deal with it.
[3:12:53] <EynoStiles> @atorl maybe its from have different tailsmans, or equipment on
[3:12:56] <olgafl0w> oleg mite be better cus he:s tanky
[3:13:06] <SilverBrass> Is the mimic bugged or something? It's not using its flasks
[3:13:08] <oda_flobunaga> too early
[3:13:11] <%luftraumm1> @Fuggins4U too risky?
[3:13:15] <SubjectX07x> Mimic's main weakness is it's a bit too eager to go in and gets itself killed on AOE poisons and the like.
[3:13:16] <%Brassnarwhal> @twistedj3ster yellow eyes irl is a sign of kidney failure
[3:13:16] <%Pyon84> @olgafl0w They both lasted about the same time
[3:13:17] <+Javaa01> @Fuggins4U The problem with that is that the animation lasts long enough that they'll both just rush him down and pancake him
[3:13:28] <@Fuggins4U> wait, the mimic CAN use flasks?
[3:13:30] <EynoStiles> @silverbrass it is just not seeingvit
[3:13:31] <%Brassnarwhal> i mean lover
[3:13:32] <roguemephilesclone> WAS THAT A PARRY FROM THE BOSS?
[3:13:33] <%BlondieFDM> Did Pat upgrade his mimic summon?
[3:13:33] <%twohitgood> should give the mimic a spell to cure it's poison.
[3:13:35] <%Brassnarwhal> liver shit
[3:13:35] <+ATorL> @EynoStiles I'll have to play around with it some time I guess
[3:13:40] <jubejube56> It uses flasks sometimes it's just that the mimic is dumbly standing in an DoT
[3:13:44] <%jamsbybetty> summon mimic without a sword and he'lll just use spells
[3:13:46] <+Javaa01> @Fuggins4U Same rules as NPC invaders, they get one
[3:13:46] <$drabberfaun535> what upgrade level is pat's weapon at?
[3:13:50] <%cascadepersona> This is one of the worst Gargoyle fights in the series, for me
[3:13:50] <SubjectX07x> @Fuggins4U It gets one or two flasks yes.
[3:13:59] <SilverBrass> Aaah, alrighty, gotcha
[3:14:14] <+Fetrigon> dps race??? PogBones PogBones PogBones
[3:14:15] <roguemephilesclone> It looked like that Art didn't deal damage on its first big swing!
[3:14:21] <%Brassnarwhal> you do good damage
[3:14:28] <%Saadi90> This feels like a coop fight but I know Pat doesn’t do coop.
[3:14:38] <%luftraumm1> i think that if he hasa the opportinity to heavy atk he should black flame instead
[3:14:55] <%Brassnarwhal> @saadi90 he just summons Gregg to help
[3:15:01] <SubjectX07x> Black flame is definitely more useful than the heavy if he can get it out..
[3:15:02] <Parapattern> It feels like you should just power through the poison
[3:15:11] <SubjectX07x> Especially since he's not using FP for the summon.
[3:15:18] <+alphonseisbest> keep at it
[3:15:18] <+gruff_gridof> doodBarf
[3:15:22] <Ekaelis> That poison sucks LUL
[3:15:22] <+ScrapKingKeita> @Parapattern the poison will kill him
[3:15:24] <+alphonseisbest> u got this pat
[3:15:26] <%MaybeFalco> @Parapattern poison does a shit ton of damage
[3:15:26] <sun312772> time to end stream pat
[3:15:27] <%Saadi90> @brassnarwhal lol. Yup
[3:15:28] <$realm_forge> @patstaresat can we name the mimic Greg?
[3:15:43] <+ScrapKingKeita> GregStaresAt
[3:15:44] <%Brassnarwhal> @subjectx07x yeah but it locks him in for ages
[3:15:47] <%luftraumm1> you're gtting progress, just have to keep at it tho
[3:15:47] <%SaiyanShoto> Isn’t this the boss that Suzi said sucks?
[3:15:50] <EynoStiles> @patstaresat Maybe time for a breathe
[3:15:50] <%TheAdMerlin> I thought the Mimic would be Rick so we have Pat and Rick
[3:15:50] <%AyotoCorp> Yeah this fight sucks
[3:15:56] <%luftraumm1> Gregg is great
[3:15:57] <Ekaelis> It builds up a dot which will deal damage while it deals damage during the build up
[3:16:00] <%TurtlesAndTentacles> I like Nortap for the Mimic better
[3:16:12] <jbrachob> Do you have any poison resist armor?
[3:16:15] <Midnight188> im partial to Nortap myself
[3:16:15] <%BallerSwagBro9k> Im down
[3:16:18] <+alphonseisbest> i'd be down for that
[3:16:19] <%Brassnarwhal> @theadmerlin summoning alter ego pat is really funny though
[3:16:23] <oda_flobunaga> How many DS3 runs did he do?
[3:16:24] <SubjectX07x> I don't use the weapon he's usin too much so I'm not familiar with its art.
[3:16:25] <Midnight188> Reverse Patron
[3:16:40] <digaogrunge> Elden Ring Remastered is getting released in 2-3 years, Pat will play again
[3:16:40] <marvel877> Pat, don't you already do that with 14?
[3:16:41] <+Beetlewins> Strike weapon would probably have a bonus to damage
[3:16:43] <EynoStiles> @patstaresat God, i wish Ff tactics was remade for the switch
[3:16:53] <NewWillinium> I'll say that it seems to run GREAT on the Ps4 shockingly enough
[3:16:56] <+Fetrigon> I'm excited to see item craft based builds
[3:16:58] <%cascadepersona> Oh yeah, wait for it if you only have PC. Massive issues on PC
[3:16:58] <+Javaa01> Yeah not on a basic bitch laptop
[3:17:01] <+alphonseisbest> its not the same
[3:17:02] <%Kevlar_Caviar> OH SHIT YOU'RE RIGHT
[3:17:05] <+gruff_gridof> i liked the demo
[3:17:08] <%BallerSwagBro9k> WAIT IT DID?
[3:17:08] <jbrachob> what?
[3:17:09] <%JoshManVGH> Do you think you'll get all the respec materials on NG+ as well? If so, the builds are going to be wild.
[3:17:10] <+alphonseisbest> idk
[3:17:12] <Saltmeisterr> soom
[3:17:13] <+LandOfTheWay> i heard triangle strategy's plot is a little weak
[3:17:15] <marvel877> Tomorrow
[3:17:16] <%Kevlar_Caviar> time to go see if the final boss theme lives up to Daughter of the Dark God
[3:17:17] <Saltmeisterr> this friday
[3:17:21] <%cascadepersona> Comes out tomorrow, yeah
[3:17:23] <+alphonseisbest> Does is have a Dragoon
[3:17:24] <TheBlankAce> Triangle strategy has been getting surprising good reviews
[3:17:26] <SubjectX07x> Hmmm, someone earlier mentioned a particularly difficult evergaol and I'm wondering which it is.
[3:17:27] <EynoStiles> but i want to throw glass bottle at character heads.
[3:17:29] <TheNix> I might have to pick that up, forgot about it
[3:17:30] <+alphonseisbest> OR THUNDER CHAD CID?
[3:17:33] <%Brassnarwhal> @subjectx07x it's really good but he's trapped for 2 swings with super armor so he cant even get knocked clear, the poison cloud makes it basically suicide unfortunately. it seems really good in other situations though
[3:17:38] <marvel877> comes out tomorrow. reviews are positive
[3:17:41] <+gruff_gridof> i would like a console or PC release of War of the Lions since its only mobile and psp i think
[3:17:42] <Saltmeisterr> @alphonseisbest nope
[3:17:42] <+Fetrigon> the demos were lit
[3:17:42] <$realm_forge> SIC EM GREG
[3:17:47] <SubjectX07x> I'm not sure if I got all of em and I am just doing clean up stuff at this point.
[3:17:49] <+FluffNir> you got this!
[3:18:00] <Saltmeisterr> man tristrat music is so fuckin good
[3:18:02] <+alphonseisbest> no dragoon no buy
[3:18:05] <%Kevlar_Caviar> ...dammit, the ost hasn't been posted to youtube yet
[3:18:18] <%cascadepersona> The only major complaints I've heard about Triangle Strategy is its plot is kinda meh and the moral choices take away from it
[3:18:21] <Saltmeisterr> even if you guys don't care about the game i recommend check it out
[3:18:21] <%Kevlar_Caviar> octopath's final boss theme was SO FUCKING GOOD, hopefully this one lives up to it
[3:18:26] <oda_flobunaga> GG
[3:18:36] <%luftraumm1> dam mimic going HARD
[3:18:40] <SubjectX07x> Lol, mimic hit him with the rot and he responded with poison.
[3:18:44] <AgnusLaplace> damn, greg went down like a bro
[3:18:45] <%MaybeFalco> you got this pat
[3:18:45] <Saltmeisterr> @Kevlar_Caviar yo i got a playist for ya
[3:18:47] <roguemephilesclone> For a summon that has a roll, Mimic is not great at using it.
[3:18:47] <SubjectX07x> Boss just straight up said "No you."
[3:18:48] <+Jeshk0> rip greg
[3:18:53] <%Brassnarwhal> TWINBLADE GARGOYLE IS SICK AS FUCK THO
[3:19:01] <Saltmeisterr> its old demo music tho
[3:19:04] <jbrachob> that looked sick with mimickun trying to out bad breath the gargoyle
[3:19:17] <AgnusLaplace> meaty axe on wakeup, damn
[3:19:20] <Augus7717> i just finished the fucking game guys HURRAY NOW I CAN LOOK AT ALL THE VIDEOS
[3:19:26] <%MaybeFalco> when in doubt lame it out
[3:19:29] <%Brassnarwhal> lingering hitbox lmao
[3:19:43] <%gitgouda> @Augus7717 grats hope you enjoyed it
[3:19:44] <%justcallmebobplease> The axe slam's AoE explosion is a later hitbox than the axe itself slamming down.
[3:19:52] <%cascadepersona> @augus7717 Congrats!
[3:19:59] <%Brassnarwhal> that was awesome
[3:20:03] <Augus7717> @gitgouda i enjoyed it greatly
[3:20:05] <SubjectX07x> Elden ring LOVES staggered hits.
[3:20:07] <eleskei> this gargoyle doin martial arts n shit
[3:20:11] <+Javaa01> @Brassnarwhal Yeah when it has the axe out the hitboxes linger cause they want you to roll to the side, and not forward/backwards
[3:20:23] <%gitgouda> @Augus7717 im 100 hours in and loving it so much.
[3:20:26] <%ScreamLord> Rockman angy
[3:20:29] <%luftraumm1> at least theres no OTGs in  this game
[3:20:30] <Midnight188> almost got OTG'd :o
[3:20:34] <Dustin_Gunn> Dustin_Gunn subscribed with Prime. They've subscribed for 2 months! If I don't give you this money, jeff bezos gets to keep it
[3:20:36] <AgnusLaplace> lul
[3:20:37] <%cascadepersona> Yeah...
[3:20:37] <SubjectX07x> Unfortunate.
[3:20:37] <oda_flobunaga> Ohhhhhhhhhhhh
[3:20:38] <jbrachob> BOOO
[3:20:38] <+alphonseisbest> dat hurt box
[3:20:41] <TheNix> That was certainly a hitbox
[3:20:41] <+FluffNir> pieBlown
[3:20:42] <$SGrim> Choke
[3:20:42] <%luftraumm1> Great ATTEMPT
[3:20:44] <oda_flobunaga> Doable
[3:20:45] <%BallerSwagBro9k> Oopsy Doo
[3:20:46] <jubejube56> over compensated
[3:20:46] <%Brassnarwhal> patron must die phase
[3:20:47] <roguemephilesclone> What is the frame data on this boss, holy cow.
[3:20:49] <eleskei> you're almost there tho
[3:20:49] <mike2hands> lytSHOOK  OH boi
[3:20:50] <+gruff_gridof> oof
[3:20:50] <femto216> :(
[3:20:51] <digaogrunge> The backswing
[3:20:51] <jbrachob> nah
[3:20:53] <Midnight188> axe startup is also a hurtbox ouch
[3:20:54] <%Brassnarwhal> very doable
[3:20:58] <RubberFistFight> wow this fight seems great Kappa
[3:21:00] <SubjectX07x> Not a choke, proof that it's doable.
[3:21:07] <+aaymon86> Who expects the boss to do that??
[3:21:12] <Augus7717> i am 90% sure that there is some super secret ending that requires you do do like everything
[3:21:16] <digaogrunge> Nah, it was the best one so far
[3:21:25] <Augus7717> i fucking hated this fight so much
[3:21:29] <+aaymon86> Yea, it's a little cheap
[3:21:36] <eleskei> capoeira skeleton monster
[3:21:39] <+ATorL> if the poison was gone I could deal with it
[3:21:45] <%Brassnarwhal> bruh
[3:21:45] <SubjectX07x> The poison honestly almost seems out of character for the boss too, like, why the hell is this gargoyle spewing poison at you?
[3:21:48] <jubejube56> the poison seems to exist exclusively to make summons have issues
[3:21:52] <+chaggles> why not summon the mimic halfway through the fight?
[3:21:56] <djblue_shift> is this them gargoyle boiz suzi's been talking about on her twitter
[3:21:57] <%BallerSwagBro9k> LUL
[3:21:59] <%dekkitout> Let's assume we know what show
[3:21:59] <Augus7717> it would be a lot better without the poison
[3:22:02] <stardustcrusad3r> Michael you stooge
[3:22:02] <CptHarlok> At least it ain't O and S 2.0 *cough cough*
[3:22:03] <%Bluwizard21> gotta be star trek right?
[3:22:09] <pi_in_the_sci> Has to be TNG, right?
[3:22:10] <ergulor> star trek most liekly
[3:22:11] <%BallerSwagBro9k> NOT STARGATE ATLANTIS
[3:22:14] <%ScreamLord> So did From Soft finally make another good Ornstien/Smough fight AND Gargoyle fight combined?
[3:22:15] <@Spydurman> LUL
[3:22:20] <$Solid_Stro> I’m guessing Star Trek
[3:22:21] <eleskei> pat u look great u look fly you got it
[3:22:21] <%maskofmichael> The time travel episode
[3:22:21] <%dekkitout> Unless he means firefly or whatev
[3:22:22] <%Saadi90> Golden Girls obviously
[3:22:27] <digaogrunge> That othe Space Opera show on TV that is not Star Trek?
[3:22:28] <oda_flobunaga> The 1970 BSG
[3:22:28] <%Deft_Thought> These attack patterns are something else, man
[3:22:28] <+Javaa01> Inb4 it was actually Golden Girls
[3:22:32] <$Cthulos> Legend of the Galactic Heroes?
[3:22:34] <oda_flobunaga> 1970s
[3:22:36] <+Javaa01> @Saadi90 Fuck
[3:22:37] <%Dustin_Gunn> @ScreamLord I just did this boss and it has some problematic RNG
[3:22:42] <mike2hands> @BallerSwagBro9k  Hey dude ,i finally find you, thanks for the compilations, they're great
[3:22:44] <+Beetlewins> Gene Roddenberry's Andromeda
[3:22:45] <%JoshManVGH> Stargate Universe.
[3:22:47] <SubjectX07x> Headshots on this thing do big damage if your swing can hit its head.
[3:22:51] <%Brassnarwhal> @screamlord gargoyles were already a duo fight what makes this o&s?
[3:22:54] <+alphonseisbest> @digaogrunge star gate, star wars, Gundam? could be anything
[3:22:58] <%Saadi90> @javaa01 aww
[3:23:07] <+Jeshk0> oof
[3:23:15] <%luftraumm1> @PatStaresAt cut some of his spells
[3:23:17] <+Beetlewins> shield?
[3:23:19] <%MaybeFalco> make the mimic powerstance for big stagger damage?
[3:23:21] <%Brassnarwhal> owie
[3:23:22] <RubberFistFight> wait did it just use a frenzied flame ability
[3:23:23] <AgnusLaplace> I somehow doubt that
[3:23:23] <%dekkitout> Run away?
[3:23:26] <%JoshManVGH> Summon and runaway?
[3:23:28] <%ScreamLord> @Brassnarwhal They use different weapons and abilities
[3:23:29] <%cascadepersona> Cheese the boss to back up into the wall?
[3:23:31] <Augus7717> upgrade it ?
[3:23:31] <djblue_shift> wait we have a double of ourselves now?
[3:23:32] <Grave_Titan_D> give up?
[3:23:34] <$Solid_Stro> Live
[3:23:34] <Midnight188> docsquiddy discovers the cringe part of the souls fanbase
[3:23:39] <digaogrunge> You should drink Physic and buff also
[3:23:39] <+Beetlewins> suplex the gargoyle
[3:23:42] <%Brassnarwhal> ranged summon could be helpful if you can keep agro
[3:23:43] <%JoshManVGH> Oh!
[3:23:44] <Augus7717> yes
[3:23:44] <%cascadepersona> Lolllll
[3:23:44] <CptHarlok> Oleg? lol
[3:23:46] <+alphonseisbest> YES
[3:23:50] <SubjectX07x> Ahhhh, I see what you're doing.
[3:23:51] <%dekkitout> Unga bunga x2
[3:23:52] <%luftraumm1> oooo ye
[3:23:55] <%JoshManVGH> Yeah alright
[3:23:57] <%BallerSwagBro9k> I dunno bout this
[3:24:01] <+Javaa01> It's your entire gear set at the moment of summoning, yes
[3:24:02] <SubjectX07x> Big brain
[3:24:05] <Midnight188> take away his options. only lightning.
[3:24:07] <%JohnAtDawn> What weapon is that? What happened to magma sword?
[3:24:07] <pi_in_the_sci> You need that poison heal though
[3:24:12] <+ATorL> he copies your item bar too
[3:24:12] <%Brassnarwhal> LIGHTNING BOLT LIGHTNING BOLT LIGHTNING BOLT
[3:24:15] <AgnusLaplace> probably should've kept cleanse there
[3:24:17] <+ATorL> so take that into account
[3:24:33] <+Beetlewins> maybe do that but with the healing spell instead?
[3:24:38] <+ReallyBigRocks> chat, you can't enchant a weapon in your left hand can you?
[3:24:38] <sirrice77> @JohnAtDawn godslayer blade, pat wanted a faith greatsword which is what that is
[3:24:40] <jbrachob> you could put your sword away and just make him throw spears all day long
[3:24:47] <%Brassnarwhal> @agnuslaplace he's better off poisoned than spamming cleanse for no reason tho
[3:24:47] <Augus7717> i like how the mimic is the most busted summon in the game because its a copy of you LUL
[3:25:14] <eleskei> why is he crouch walking tho does he have back problems
[3:25:22] <%MaybeFalco> YEYE
[3:25:27] <%BallerSwagBro9k> YOOOOOOO

[3:29:31] <Giztech> would the lighting spell from above stun them more?

[3:31:21] <+Jeshk0> have you ever put a bowtie on gief? hed be so handsome :)
[3:31:21] <+Beetlewins> you have any poison resistant talismans?
[3:31:22] <%RonaldMcDownload> GivePLZ lrrCIRCLE
[3:31:30] <%jamsbybetty> throw on one of those immunity talismans to take the edge off that poison
[3:31:33] <%Brassnarwhal> yes
[3:31:44] <Midnight188> ironmouseMeltdown ironmouseMeltdown ironmouseMeltdown ironmouseMeltdown ironmouseMeltdown ironmouseMeltdown does Pat have the power?
[3:32:04] <eleskei> physics having a hard time with that staglamite
[3:32:07] <+PkSilent01> Wait does that Great Sword Scales with DEX?
[3:32:11] <%Brassnarwhal> if you put the heal over time in your physik it will last most of the fight and mostly counter the poison effects
[3:32:19] <manateeworkshop> maybe come back to it?
[3:32:29] <%MaybeFalco> maybe weapon art instead of riposte on the stagger? it seemed to do a shit ton of damage when both swings hit
[3:32:32] <niffinbox> that rock was freaking out
[3:32:35] <+Beetlewins> can you wield one of the big hammers?
[3:32:41] <RubberFistFight> how long til the pinball machine experiences full tilt Kappa
[3:32:42] <stardustcrusad3r> sugoiDansuhyper sugoiDansuhyper sugoiDansuhyper
[3:33:00] <%Brassnarwhal> yeah those clouds are brutal
[3:33:33] <FrozenStack> The trick is to read him your poetry to stun lock him.
[3:33:41] <+red_cuppa> spicy meat pizza ball
[3:33:45] <%luftraumm1> is it CLOAK time?
[3:33:51] <roguemephilesclone> KAPOW
[3:33:51] <%Brassnarwhal> i wish my poison cloud incantation did the cool murder cloud like theirs
[3:33:51] <+Javaa01> Oh no, not the spicy pizza ball
[3:33:52] <imthewisejanitor> Babadi boopy!
[3:33:57] <%BallerSwagBro9k> Meat Pizza Ball?
[3:34:05] <+Beetlewins> Honestly feels like one of those fights where after you takedown the second one something massive bursts through the waterfall
[3:34:08] <%luftraumm1> aw damn i wish you used that dumb cloak more
[3:34:13] <$realm_forge> Pat just went on a world tour with that one
[3:34:19] <imthewisejanitor> That's a wonderful Chris Pratt impression, Pat.
[3:34:26] <sm3llly> Mother Mia
[3:34:38] <%Brassnarwhal> that was straight up the stomp weapon art
[3:34:45] <radiorosewater> woolieDATTEBAYO
[3:34:53] <%emperordread> Holy moly
[3:34:54] <%Brassnarwhal> these guys are using real weapon arts
[3:35:15] <Namillus> I love when ridiculous monsters use real movesets
[3:35:19] <Grave_Titan_D> isn't lightning holy?
[3:35:26] <radiorosewater> woolieGLORY
[3:35:30] <%jamsbybetty> one thing I wish this game had was a training dummy to beat on to see how different attacks stack up vs one another
[3:35:36] <+Beetlewins> god but shrines of marika are one of the best additions to the souls formula
[3:35:36] <Namillus> Lightning and Holy are their own damage types now
[3:35:38] <%Brassnarwhal> @namillus so do i it's very cool
[3:35:46] <jubejube56> that was almost a 50% increase I think
[3:36:07] <%Brassnarwhal> @jamsbybetty you could always go beat up on the gargoyle at the beast church
[3:36:14] <eleskei> Squid1 Squid3 Squid2 Squid4
[3:36:25] <mike2hands> DOUBLE KILL
[3:36:27] <roguemephilesclone> That was unfortunate.
[3:36:34] <Giztech> @PatStaresAt if you want minic to have strong lighting equip the fath and holy dmg increase
[3:36:39] <%Brassnarwhal> collat
[3:36:42] <$Solid_Stro> sabert14Tsk
[3:36:51] <%jamsbybetty> @Brassnarwhal does he not attack? I never got close enough to find out lmao
[3:37:12] <%Brassnarwhal> @jamsbybetty oh he does once you swing on him
[3:37:40] <%jamsbybetty> @Brassnarwhal ahhhh
[3:37:45] <%Brassnarwhal> @jamsbybetty as long as your dodges are on point it's a great way to check damage numbers cause he's right by a grace and you'll never 1shot him
[3:38:17] <$EsotericOdyssey> are there any enemies so far that you just avoid or run past on sight? I have 3: Giant Bears, Giant Land Octopuses, and Giant Hand-Spiders
[3:38:18] <%jamsbybetty> @Brassnarwhal thanks for the tip!
[3:38:25] <%Brassnarwhal> risky though, like practicing juggling with real knoves
[3:38:26] <%luftraumm1> now rins and repeat
[3:38:28] <djblue_shift> wow that weapon art fucks
[3:38:31] <%MaybeFalco> yeah fuckin 2400 vs the like 1200 you were getting on the riposte
[3:38:49] <oda_flobunaga> @EsotericOdyssey Peoplepedes
[3:38:51] <niffinbox> weapon art was a great shout
[3:38:53] <jubejube56> yeah keeping that guy right next to the door seems like an excellent way to not aggro the twinblade as fast
[3:38:56] <+Beetlewins> We made our gargoyles acrobatic as fuck
[3:39:02] <roguemephilesclone> It's go time.
[3:39:09] <%Brassnarwhal> @jamsbybetty honestly one of the trolls in limgrave is a way better test they have big health and won't stomp on your nuts
[3:39:16] <+0ni0n_L0rd> UNF
[3:39:20] <$stub_master> you mad, huh?
[3:39:20] <$lotharrio> Seems like he was mad, yeah
[3:39:21] <$SGrim> Talked shit, got hit
[3:39:21] <+aaymon86> That was new
[3:39:21] <dOjOTron> big mad
[3:39:22] <TheMadDemoknight> Oh no, got 'em

[3:39:29] <%mythcreant> big MAD
[3:39:33] <$Solid_Stro> Yeah he mad
[3:39:35] <%Brassnarwhal> it wasn't new
[3:39:40] <digaogrunge> Use your buffing spell
[3:39:45] <+BrakmangHi5> have you tried compassion? a hug perhaps
[3:39:51] <+pectusumbra> oooo, what's this new thing now?
[3:40:09] <%WutangchickeN> Here to see who gets Pat with a deez nuts joke today
[3:40:29] <+aaymon86> I swear when it did the 2nd slam before, there wasn't a shockwave
[3:40:41] <%Brassnarwhal> @wutangchicken speaking if deez did you see what D drops?
[3:40:41] <%mythcreant> NICE
[3:40:42] <%WutangchickeN> That was SICK
[3:40:42] <%MaybeFalco> YEYEYE DO IT PAT
[3:40:43] <roguemephilesclone> AI freeze?
[3:40:49] <%gitgouda> BEST ANIME SOULS BATTLE NUMBER 1
[3:40:51] <+pectusumbra> okay, some really cool stick!
[3:40:54] <imthewisejanitor> BIG BIG MAN
[3:40:54] <+Beetlewins> just stand there i guess
[3:40:58] <digaogrunge> JUST USE BLACK FLAME
[3:41:01] <%WutangchickeN> @Brassnarwhal no what does d drop wutang6FLAVOR wutang6FLAVOR wutang6FLAVOR
[3:41:08] <djblue_shift> @aaymon86 probably happens when it's all buffed up

[3:41:18] <%Brassnarwhal> @wutangchicken D's Nuts

[3:41:56] <%gitgouda> LUL
[3:42:00] <%Brassnarwhal> he's seeing the code
[3:42:04] <mike2hands> lytDUNKED
[3:42:05] <%BallerSwagBro9k> LETSGOOOOOO
[3:42:08] <roguemephilesclone> Oops, got read.
[3:42:08] <%MaybeFalco> you got this shit
[3:42:10] <%BallerSwagBro9k> oh
[3:42:10] <$Solid_Stro> sabert14Smug
[3:42:12] <ReenBenkyou> you got this Pat!
[3:42:14] <$lotharrio> He's starting to believe...
[3:42:17] <%BallerSwagBro9k> I thought he won
[3:42:17] <%luftraumm1> YOU GOT THIS
[3:42:17] <imthewisejanitor> "He's beginning to believe."
[3:42:21] <MusouMiko> yes
[3:42:22] <%mythcreant> yes
[3:42:23] <MusouMiko> 100%
[3:42:24] <%Brassnarwhal> oh no he has to recompile the code was wrong
[3:42:25] <%MaybeFalco> sometimes yeah
[3:42:27] <%mythcreant> it's personal
[3:42:29] <%AyotoCorp> Absolutely
[3:42:29] <%MaybeFalco> especially with dragons
[3:42:29] <%BallerSwagBro9k> They are
[3:42:30] <%TurtlesAndTentacles> yes
[3:42:30] <%JustTheGuyYouNeed> they super read your attacks
[3:42:32] <MavMedic81> Ya boi LETS GO!!!
[3:42:32] <%gitgouda> yeah sometimes it feels like i hit them and they go OH REALLY?
[3:42:36] <%Brassnarwhal> yes
[3:42:36] <%MaybeFalco> and the godskin
[3:42:36] <MusouMiko> they absolutely are reading inputs
[3:42:36] <oz19999> oh yeah, they take that shit personal
[3:42:38] <+SaintSalted> yes frame 1
[3:42:39] <+shirou_kokkan> dude i got teleported to caelid
[3:42:40] <SubjectX07x> Oh they definitely do
[3:42:41] <RubberFistFight> @PatStaresAt yes, the AI has been tuned to run off your actions. it essentially input-reads you.
[3:42:45] <%Brassnarwhal> it feels like they read inputs
[3:42:46] <%dekkitout> Are you asking if they have behaivour models? Cause they always did
[3:42:48] <+aaymon86> Yes.  These are the smartest bosses I've ever seen
[3:42:49] <+ATorL> haven't they always punished estus drinking?
[3:42:51] <AgnusLaplace> you think miyazaki wouldn't make it like that?
[3:42:55] <%Dustin_Gunn> @PatStaresAt they 100% read your estus inputs
[3:42:56] <%colezone_> Margit specifically responds to your dodge timing on certain attacks
[3:42:57] <RubberFistFight> It's obvious with any boss that holds its attack until you roll or dodge, like Margit or Godrick
[3:43:03] <%Brassnarwhal> like straight up same frame as drink fireball, fuck off
[3:43:03] <%gitgouda> @shirou_kokkan lot of that going around.
[3:43:04] <Giztech> wouldn't put it past FromSoft to make some crazy shit that harder enemies @PatStaresAt
[3:43:05] <$Solid_Stro> They absolutely respond to you drinking flasks
[3:43:08] <CptHarlok> It does feel like aggro is a whimsical concept in this game
[3:43:10] <RubberFistFight> @Dustin_Gunn they read ALL your inputs
[3:43:16] <+anonderkerr> Pat I sent you a pic of my pp on twitter pls respond
[3:43:18] <+shirou_kokkan> i believe it
[3:43:27] <oda_flobunaga> nope
[3:43:28] <%mythcreant> nein
[3:43:28] <%BallerSwagBro9k> I know its a game mechanic but O really
[3:43:29] <%luftraumm1> gotta run away
[3:43:31] <digaogrunge> Try to hit the black flame while clone distracts him
[3:43:37] <%Brassnarwhal> @anonderkerr pls show bobs and vagene
[3:43:39] <SubjectX07x> No, if you're in the area it seeeeems like the ending has an AOE after the fact.
[3:43:44] <%ScreamLord> SPEEN
[3:43:45] <$lotharrio> anonder asking the real questions.
[3:43:57] <%MaybeFalco> also the huge wind-up time
[3:43:59] <%BallerSwagBro9k> I know its a game mechanic but I wish you could drink cancel
[3:43:59] <%Brassnarwhal> storm caller weapon art
[3:44:01] <KasiCrafter> Does Barricade Shield withstand that tornado attack?
[3:44:02] <jubejube56> well before the speen it looks like he takes to the air
[3:44:14] <%Brassnarwhal> that's what he's doing i mean
[3:44:23] <digaogrunge> Yeah, but other then stagger is your only chance
[3:44:31] <Shiibbae> Definately harder than Radan
[3:44:33] <%Brassnarwhal> NOT THE BURGERS
[3:45:01] <+BrakmangHi5> he's eyeing the location of the treats XD
[3:45:04] <%Dustin_Gunn> @Shiibbae hard to say, since radahn is more of a series of coinflips than a fight
[3:45:08] <AgnusLaplace> has he equiped the cleanse spell yet or is that too big brain for pat?
[3:45:14] <RubberFistFight> yeah adding direct damage to DOT clouds was a poor choice, i think
[3:45:37] <$Smokay17> If you Dragon scarlet rot does the mimic too?
[3:45:40] <mrtanaka111> emotional support dog
[3:45:43] <+SaintSalted> the clouds pissed me off so much
[3:45:48] <+SaintSalted> its dumb
[3:45:51] <%Pyon84> Are there any powerful ranged summons in the game?
[3:45:53] <%Brassnarwhal> @agnuslaplace if the clone spams cleanse he will just die, if pat tries to cleanse he will get blown up, he already said the dot is not the issue
[3:45:57] <+ATorL> @AgnusLaplace cleanse doesn't contribute anything. It's not the poison affliction doing damage, the puddles do direct damage
[3:46:01] <$Solid_Stro> Dog healing emotional damage
[3:46:08] <%twistedj3ster> peer pressure them
[3:46:12] <penitentpendant> Yeah, these two are sort of the 'wall against people who abuse status effects'
[3:46:25] <Shiibbae> Blunt weapon time perhaps? Bc they’re like stone n stuff
[3:46:25] <%Brassnarwhal> @pyon84 highly recommend the marionet soldiers with the bows they are nutty
[3:46:32] <vile_brand> how much does a fully charged R2 do?
[3:46:47] <+Beetlewins> do oyu have time to get behind and black flame while they'e poison puking?
[3:46:48] <%Pyon84> @Brassnarwhal Cool thanks!
[3:46:49] <AgnusLaplace> oh, I'm big dumb then
[3:47:13] <SaltyAzteca> Ey yo trapped chest are awesome! That is all
[3:47:15] <oda_flobunaga> Pat Pat, He's our Man, If he can't Do it Peaches can.
[3:47:15] <$Solid_Stro> Full Unga
[3:47:20] <%AyotoCorp> Have you tried doing the crouching attack?
[3:47:25] <%luftraumm1> that cloud is DUMB
[3:47:27] <%gitgouda> ok i got it pat, this time dont die.
[3:47:27] <%AyotoCorp> Just in general
[3:47:30] <%MaybeFalco> ye charged attacks take too much time
[3:47:36] <vile_brand> he will starve
[3:47:36] <%twistedj3ster> Gief gon starve
[3:47:41] <%Brassnarwhal> @pyon84 they don't nuke but they rapid spam arrows and it pisses off everything they are great at pulling agro especially on hard to track enemies cause they can track even invisible dudes its nuts
[3:47:42] <%Bluwizard21> geif gonna starve
[3:47:43] <butterick> FOOD NOW
[3:47:43] <%JustTheGuyYouNeed> stop trying to starve gief
[3:47:44] <%ScreamLord> Yeah the damage boost isn't worth the vulnerability
[3:47:44] <tolloponik> Geif
[3:47:46] <penitentpendant> Zangief: "Oh no! I'll starve!"
[3:47:46] <NBUsagi> poor Gief
[3:47:48] <%ShawnTK_> he will never eat now
[3:47:49] <Explodincatz> rip dog
[3:47:49] <Midnight188> gief never gettin that dinner :O [kidding]
[3:47:50] <+Beetlewins> yeah these things would be a problem even without the poison puddle bollocks
[3:47:50] <%Piemen99> BUT HE'LL STARVE PAT
[3:47:53] <%twistedj3ster> teehee
[3:47:53] <%Pyon84> He's gonna starve! Kappa
[3:47:55] <%gitgouda> lul gonna starve.
[3:47:55] <Giztech> cheeky parry?
[3:47:57] <vile_brand> totally gonna starve
[3:47:57] <+BetrayingBenny> Zangief is going to be put on a giga diet
[3:47:59] <tri3dgE027> poor pupper
[3:47:59] <MidnightPacif1c> FeelsBadMan starved
[3:48:00] <$Solid_Stro> Helm Splitters all day
[3:48:02] <tolloponik> Geif: but father, I have no faith in you...
[3:48:09] <butterick> he's wasting away!!!!
[3:48:11] <+Beetlewins> I heard Zangief has never had any food in his entire life
[3:48:11] <%Piemen99> Someone call PETA
[3:48:14] <%ScreamLord> Zangief hasn't eaten anything for 10 minutes. You monster
[3:48:16] <MavMedic81> Bill Burr is looking stressed
[3:48:17] <jacksawjack> I can see the poor baby wasting away from here!
[3:48:24] <%Brassnarwhal> @ayotocorp @beetlewins tragic
[3:48:42] <%luftraumm1> this boss feels like a big anti cheat check
[3:48:46] <SaltyAzteca> Visions of Dark Souls 1
[3:48:46] <%ShawnTK_> What if there's a third one
[3:48:48] <lyzejag> PSYCHO streamer doesn't let his dog eat fiid
[3:48:49] <stardustcrusad3r> he looks so cute just sittin (zangief)
[3:48:54] <NBUsagi> Gief "im hungry..."
[3:48:56] <mrtanaka111> take a breather dude
[3:48:57] <%Brassnarwhal> sorry ayotocorp idk how you got mixed up in there
[3:49:06] <butterick> soon he will be a spooky skellingtob
[3:49:14] <%strakillias> Mimic would be a lot better if he could learn to roll
[3:49:14] <penitentpendant> Zangief: "That's my secret chat, I'M ALWAYS HUNGRY!"
[3:49:20] <%Dustin_Gunn> zangief looks like a stuffed animal
[3:49:22] <Glockroach2774> Playing the new Kirby demo. pretty fun so far
[3:49:24] <SubjectX07x> To whoever was asking if the mimic can use weapons that you yourself aren't statted for, yes but they will have the same inability to deal damage with them that you do.
[3:49:29] <+BetrayingBenny> Have you considered not getting hit?
[3:49:47] <SubjectX07x> So you can't just give a mimic a greatsword if you don't have the strength for it.
[3:49:49] <SaltyAzteca> He's learning
[3:49:57] <%Brassnarwhal> be nice to Gregg he doesn't play much dark soul
[3:50:00] <+678saintglock> my mimic is a huge badass he’s better than me
[3:50:18] <digaogrunge> Is there an Iron/Stoneskin equivalent in this game?
[3:50:22] <%Brassnarwhal> well done pat
[3:50:32] <mrtanaka111> about time
[3:50:36] <jubejube56> oh shit
[3:50:37] <penitentpendant> Flee
[3:51:10] <%Deft_Thought> @digaogrunge There's a lil one use shield that gives you damage reduction
[3:51:13] <Kaito_Cam> does pat have mimic tear?
[3:51:21] <%twistedj3ster> yeah but you're doing amazing
[3:51:22] <SaltyAzteca> No cures? D:
[3:51:25] <+pectusumbra> what about your clense spell?
[3:51:33] <penitentpendant> Yeah, might have to revisit the grace and reset your spells for this boss
[3:51:35] <SaltyAzteca> LOOKIT THIS GUY GO
[3:51:38] <+pectusumbra> anhhhhhh
[3:51:46] <penitentpendant> So close!
[3:51:48] <+pectusumbra> almost there!
[3:51:52] <+Beetlewins> far too many spinny attack enemies in this game tbh
[3:51:56] <%greasypete00> nooo
[3:51:57] <%twistedj3ster> PHUCK
[3:51:58] <%Deft_Thought> WHAT
[3:51:59] <mrtanaka111> paaaaaaaaaaaaaaaat
[3:51:59] <penitentpendant> The backhand
[3:51:59] <Shiibbae> YOU GOT THIS
[3:52:00] <+sssoapy> daamn
[3:52:00] <%JohnAtDawn> WHAT
[3:52:01] <+wizard_of_diamonds> BRUTAL
[3:52:02] <%luftraumm1> i cant believe you take your eyes off the screen to read chat its crazy
[3:52:05] <+KazairLux> so close
[3:52:06] <+wizard_of_diamonds> That was so much dmg with one hit
[3:52:07] <%JohnAtDawn> FACTS
[3:52:13] <%MaybeFalco> if you manage to make it that far might as well lame it out with the lightning bolts
[3:52:14] <%Pyon84> Change flask distribution and lighting his butt?
[3:52:15] <%luftraumm1> but you are fucking awesomoe
[3:52:16] <trasherxl> if im not mistaken, there is some magic to buff and heal summons, maybe trying to keep mimic alive longer would be of use here?
[3:52:17] <tri3dgE027> time to craft a couple of green stuff
[3:52:17] <+Beetlewins> that seemed cheap as fuck
[3:52:20] <+pectusumbra> can you craft immune meat or whatever it's called?
[3:52:22] <SaltyAzteca> aite
[3:52:24] <KasiCrafter> The stomp apperantly did damage....?
[3:52:28] <%luftraumm1> luftraumm1 is gifting 1 Tier 1 Subs to PatStaresAt's community! They've gifted a total of 2 in the channel! 
[3:52:29] <%luftraumm1> luftraumm1 gifted a Tier 1 sub to DIOSZAWARUDO! 
[3:52:40] <Tenebrae94> can you craft poison cures?
[3:52:50] <%Brassnarwhal> @digaogrunge the heal over time physik would help increase your time limit, i know in that case it wouldnt have mattered but it could
[3:52:55] <+alphonseisbest> YES
[3:53:08] <%Brassnarwhal> how do people keep getting @ed in my messages I'm going insane
[3:53:13] <SubjectX07x> @PatStaresAt You should probably give the mimic a different greatsword, he is killing himself trying to use the black flame ability.
[3:53:17] <+orochiblood> as much as i enjoy this game, the hitboxes are so wonky
[3:53:20] <$zyberion626> Paige just one shot Godrick
[3:53:24] <digaogrunge> Sound is cracking for anyone else?
[3:53:39] <SubjectX07x> Paige the chadette as usual.
[3:53:47] <penitentpendant> @zyberion626 Just Paige things
[3:53:49] <SaltyAzteca> "Godslayer's Greatsword"? That sounds beast
[3:53:51] <+RedMaskBandit> ayoo Paige beat godrickussy
[3:53:59] <+RedMaskBandit> PokBlaziken
[3:54:00] <%SaiyanShoto> Wonky hit boxes are the norm with FromSoft games
[3:54:05] <penitentpendant> TBF, that's true in lore anyway
[3:54:14] <+eanscrale> well Kenneth Haight did say "that guy is a bitch ass chump"
[3:54:14] <SubjectX07x> His boss fight isn't really THAT hard.
[3:54:15] <sirrice77> Paige is big and strong and also godrick is cannonically considered a lil bitch
[3:54:20] <jubejube56> ik you went through the list of summons already but didn't the lucaria knights survive into phase 2 the one time you tried them?
[3:54:21] <NBUsagi> Gief hungy
[3:54:22] <%luftraumm1> fucking oleg is the chaddest chad in this game]
[3:54:25] <%Dustin_Gunn> OLEG TV
[3:54:26] <+Beetlewins> ranged attack hitboxes are wonky as hell in this. Seen my arrows go through enemies so many times
[3:54:28] <niffinbox> woolie Is basically making vergil in his run
[3:54:28] <Varanoo> Godrick is a bitchass punk in the lore as well so it works out
[3:54:31] <%Brassnarwhal> he was really tough for me I didn't have an oleg just a jellyfish
[3:54:32] <RubberFistFight> Pat: "Look at what I did!" Oleg: "You didn't do that, I did." Pat: "Look at what I took credit for doing!"
[3:54:49] <+pectusumbra> Also woolie found the sorcery trainer at the end of his stream and has become super cool
[3:54:51] <%Brassnarwhal> he does this wind tunnel shit that killed me every time i only won when he didnt use it
[3:54:55] <+RedMaskBandit> Paige had a jellyfish
[3:55:11] <NBUsagi> Woolie downloaded whole new tech at the end of the stream
[3:55:20] <%Brassnarwhal> @redmaskbandit she had also been to caelid lol
[3:55:22] <RubberFistFight> don't you blame that sweet boy, he's doing his best
[3:55:43] <%Brassnarwhal> GREGG NOOO
[3:55:49] <+RedMaskBandit> @brassnarwhal that npc doesn't count and you know it.
[3:56:08] <%theDesender> damn
[3:56:08] <SubjectX07x> Jesus, the amount of times I have seen that mimic waste time with that black flame attack..
[3:56:08] <NBUsagi> Ooft so close
[3:56:10] <xerotwo> O O P A H H LUL
[3:56:14] <%MaybeFalco> wow i think the mimic woke it up early from stagger
[3:56:15] <digaogrunge> That rock formation near the entrance seems to be the best place to fight them , some of his attacks go over you
[3:56:17] <$Smokay17> Do you have the Jellyfish summon?
[3:56:18] <%jamsbybetty> double kill
[3:56:19] <SubjectX07x> Yes.
[3:56:23] <SaltyAzteca> Pat and Gregg got got NotLikeThis
[3:56:28] <SubjectX07x> It copies everything down to your stats.
[3:56:29] <penitentpendant> Your stats affect the mimic's
[3:56:30] <$Solid_Stro> Do Do Double Kill
[3:56:38] <%Brassnarwhal> @redmaskbandit if she beat godric today that means she beat radhan before godric
[3:56:47] <SubjectX07x> But it will have higher HP, by a lot.
[3:56:47] <+Javaa01> Yeah your entire loadout affects the mimic
[3:56:56] <ohno58> even what items you have equipped
[3:57:00] <SubjectX07x> I am curious what EXACTLY the stat modifiers it gets are tbh.
[3:57:03] <RubberFistFight> oh also jsyk, unless it's since been patched, apparently there's a bug that if your weapon has any scaling in arcane, it causes all the scaling to actually be 0. ALL of it, not just the arcane stuff.
[3:57:07] <ohno58> It's not shy about using them either
[3:57:07] <SubjectX07x> Sounds like a zullie video in the making.
[3:57:11] <RubberFistFight> may be PC only, i shall check
[3:57:16] <%zentheman01> Getting that weird audio stuff now too
[3:57:18] <Giztech> @PatStaresAt did you reequip the jump ring?
[3:57:20] <SaltyAzteca> The fact that it two hits just baffles me
[3:57:25] <%zentheman01> refresh didn't fix, weirdly enough
[3:57:33] <limewolf4> zullie the witch has some great vids
[3:57:35] <%AyotoCorp> @PatStaresAt I was slightly off on the second point
[3:57:38] <Shiibbae> @rubberfistfight I believe we debunked that a few streams ago
[3:57:53] <jubejube56> can it cast anything that buffs you?
[3:58:05] <$Solid_Stro> It’s entertaining to watch the mimic run in just to get struck like a golf ball
[3:58:29] <RubberFistFight> @Shiibbae there's a reddit thread from 1 day ago talking about it. It'
[3:58:32] <SubjectX07x> Yeeeah, the mimic is HYPER aggressive and its often to its detriment.
[3:58:34] <+Javaa01> @jubejube56 Yeah, but since he does what he wants, it's better to just cast AOE buffs on *it*
[3:58:36] <jbrachob> he just loves poison
[3:58:39] <%Brassnarwhal> earlier today i was doing jolly co-op and as the boss died i got kicked from the game and it doubled my souls, the boss should have given me 6k but i went from 20k to 40k instead, anyone else experience this?
[3:58:40] <RubberFistFight> It's any weapon with MIXED Arcane scaling, not pure arcane weapons.
[3:58:45] <%Saadi90> Sheva!
[3:58:55] <limewolf4> is there anyway to get twitch on a roku tv??
[3:58:57] <+ArtemisCroc> I use my mimic as a glass cannon caster
[3:59:07] <$Solid_Stro> Chris!
[3:59:19] <%luftraumm1> maybe you could give the mimic the UGS
[3:59:24] <%strakillias> It looks like Gief just noticed Skelmo
[3:59:25] <%TurtlesAndTentacles> Get more Spell
[3:59:29] <%TurtlesAndTentacles> All Spell.
[3:59:46] <%MaybeFalco> powerstance mimic
[3:59:46] <terrible35> eat his ribs Gief
[3:59:52] <SubjectX07x> Lol let's see.
[3:59:54] <Varanoo> LUL
[3:59:57] <%luftraumm1> he gon spam the fire
[4:00:00] <+BrakmangHi5> Gief is planning something
[4:00:05] <penitentpendant> Mimic Tech!
[4:00:06] <digaogrunge> PUNNNNCHHHH
[4:00:17] <%TurtlesAndTentacles> Myself and @EynoStiles  We saying that the moment you go the mimic
[4:00:24] <SaltyAzteca> Greg is doin it!!
[4:00:25] <%Pyon84> All lighting?
[4:00:31] <SubjectX07x> Good weapons for the mimic are things with very quick FP moves.
[4:00:35] <SubjectX07x> Because it loves using FP moves.
[4:00:35] <%Brassnarwhal> bruh
[4:00:36] <jubejube56> so then if you gave it no weapon it would always cast
[4:00:37] <jmft2000> He was doing more damage
[4:00:37] <%luftraumm1> there's actualy no cutting corners here
[4:00:45] <SubjectX07x> IE, Moonveil
[4:00:49] <jbrachob> fire was doing well
[4:00:50] <%Brassnarwhal> give the mimic the blood slash
[4:00:58] <penitentpendant> Yup, but the gap between killing first and second is small and crucial
[4:01:03] <%Brassnarwhal> if mimic blood slashes it will fick shit up
[4:01:07] <%Dustin_Gunn> there's a taunting talisman
[4:01:17] <SaltyAzteca> Suddenly, axe
[4:01:23] <ape_hawk> did pat fight lykdiiz yet?
[4:01:27] <%TurtlesAndTentacles> Did Pat feed Gief yet?
[4:01:28] <SubjectX07x> Definitely recommend blood slash for the mimic.
[4:01:29] <ebrion> It changes weapons like a trick weapon
[4:01:42] <Midnight188> lyk diiz nuts?
[4:01:44] <%BlondieFDM> Pat just hit the thing super hard and it should die
[4:01:48] <oda_flobunaga> @ape_hawk no nots for you
[4:01:51] <oda_flobunaga> nuts
[4:01:52] <SaltyAzteca> @ape_hawk Who's Steve Jobs
[4:01:52] <SubjectX07x> Honestly I used blood slash for the LONGEST time.
[4:01:55] <%Brassnarwhal> he used a switch move
[4:01:59] <limewolf4> so lykdeeeeez nuts
[4:02:01] <%BlondieFDM> Welcome psaWhat
[4:02:10] <%Brassnarwhal> blood slashing mimic could be really huge
[4:02:32] <%BlondieFDM> Having a max upgraded mimic for this fight is a godsend
[4:02:37] <%TurtlesAndTentacles> I know i must be frustrating because he almost had it like 5 tries ago
[4:02:41] <%TurtlesAndTentacles> it*
[4:02:46] <fishmonger555> wish armor did stuff, I'd very much like to not get consistently 2 shot
[4:02:53] <Parapattern> Does hitting him on his busted leg do more stagger damage?
[4:03:07] <%MaybeFalco> there's also a tear that does straight damage negation, rather than a bubbleshield, but its in altus
[4:03:09] <%Pyon84> This fight seems very unforgiving for melee
[4:03:13] <+MoeScams> is there an option to not see the players and the hints in game?
[4:03:19] <%MartinOfLoxley> I feel like the second half of that Gargoyle's lifebar is part luck
[4:03:20] <%TurtlesAndTentacles> Gief is Lion
[4:03:21] <SubjectX07x> Max upgraded mimic is dummy strong
[4:03:23] <%TheAdMerlin> You could give the mimic a shield while you keep two handed
[4:03:23] <%Brassnarwhal> @fishmonger555 Try Vigor
[4:03:27] <SaltyAzteca> offline mode?
[4:03:27] <%BlondieFDM> @MoeScams Play in offline mode
[4:03:36] <vile_brand> does 2 normal R1 take the same amount of time as a jump attack?
[4:03:37] <ohno58> HEAL
[4:03:38] <%luftraumm1> heal
[4:03:40] <%MaybeFalco> LMAO
[4:03:40] <%Brassnarwhal> you got body blocked rip

[4:03:51] <meloshav> rip lol
[4:03:52] <$SGrim> YEAH! , dies
[4:03:54] <%twohitgood> what if you gave the mimic your best heal as a second spell?
[4:03:55] <%Brassnarwhal> what is max?
[4:03:56] <jubejube56> it's a thought
[4:04:03] <radiorosewater> big think
[4:04:06] <%MaybeFalco> you gotta be quick to run out of those pools then, can't take more than a single tick
[4:04:07] <%Saadi90> Are you streaming the live letter Tomorrow?
[4:04:13] <%luftraumm1> big think mode

[4:04:44] <vance168> Yeah Spite!
[4:04:44] <digaogrunge> DRINK YOU BUFF JUICE
[4:04:45] <yyyyfdugyu> do you think they put this boss after the mimic for the players that got it thought they had easy mode unlocked
[4:04:48] <djblue_shift> he's using rtsr why y'all tellin him to heal
[4:04:57] <%Pyon84> YO SICK

[4:05:33] <%Brassnarwhal> HOLY AHIT DANGER PAT
[4:05:44] <+austinj24> WE TWINKIN BAYBEEE
[4:05:47] <%Kevlar_Caviar> How long has he been doing this fight? An hour at least, right?
[4:05:57] <%Pyon84> DAS A GOOD ONE THO
[4:05:58] <%greasypete00> YEAH BUT THAT WAS REALLY GOOD THO
[4:05:59] <%delilah4you> wow holy shit that was WILD
[4:06:00] <%Brassnarwhal> danger pat with barrier is a powerful pat
[4:06:01] <%twistedj3ster> that was GOOD though

[4:06:01] <%TurtlesAndTentacles> UNGA BUNGA
[4:06:01] <NBUsagi> I was clenched up that whole fight
[4:06:02] <+alphonseisbest> GOOD FUCKING RUN THO
[4:06:04] <oda_flobunaga> New Greg, same as the Oleg
[4:06:04] <senfood> HE'S SO GOT IT
[4:06:04] <SaltyAzteca> Was a good strat
[4:06:06] <%MaybeFalco> thats legitimately a good idea
[4:06:07] <$lotharrio> Interesting strategy, though.
[4:06:08] <%luftraumm1> you did great
[4:06:09] <%twohitgood> great run. hypermode paying off.
[4:06:17] <digaogrunge> GOOD PLAN
[4:06:18] <%MartinOfLoxley> LUL Unga Bunga to the max
[4:06:21] <niffinbox> pat seems to do better under threat of instant death
[4:06:25] <NBUsagi> Pat's ultimate power, not fearing death
[4:06:26] <jubejube56> That would work on the first gargoyle but idk if you know the second one well enough to stay low health
[4:06:38] <digaogrunge> Stack power within also
[4:06:40] <%luftraumm1> his face seems to take more damage
[4:06:43] <vile_brand> since you took your shields off, do you have slightly better armor?
[4:06:43] <femto216> Then spam lighting
[4:06:52] <%TurtlesAndTentacles> ME PATRON. HIM GREG. YOU DIE NOW

[4:07:27] <adithehella> has anyone seen the thai ad for elden ring
[4:07:30] <jmft2000> Then go complete naked and do more damage with that token
[4:07:37] <penitentpendant> Oof
[4:07:38] <vile_brand> then why wear armor?
[4:07:44] <jacksawjack> Fylnn talisman and get naked
[4:08:00] <digaogrunge> GO NAKED THEN
[4:08:07] <oda_flobunaga> @PatStaresAt I had 15 Vit when I did this.  Getting 2 shot is a privilege
[4:08:30] <%Pyon84> well screw that move
[4:08:32] <$Solid_Stro> Get in that booty son
[4:08:35] <%luftraumm1> that attack is absolute garbage
[4:08:35] <penitentpendant> Ah yes, the 'no dodge spam' attack
[4:08:41] <FeralFozzie> made a pat smoothie
[4:08:47] <senfood> Oh yeah, that would super work.
[4:08:47] <Gamer76255> The steel protection  ring equivalent  is below the beast sanctum.May help

[4:09:03] <%MaybeFalco> but mimic will also be naked too, dont know how much that effects it
[4:09:05] <$Smokay17> Just use Jellyfish as a decoy?

[4:32:38] <%SveriSageAdvice> but its cool to do
[4:32:39] <Sunstalker> It's for the divine tower, at the least
[4:32:42] <%shootbang_exe> yes it does?
[4:32:43] <%Bluwizard21> this is really important i have no idea what they are talking about

[4:34:04] <%Pyon84> Is there really a sequence tho?
[4:34:05] <+extantCadence> You people told him what to do, you should have gone back to Ranni and found a new grace that leads you to Renna's
[4:34:07] <%SveriSageAdvice> everything about the game feels like it was meant to be broken to hell and back lol
[4:34:18] <%TurtlesAndTentacles> Did Pat ever get another Death Root
[4:34:19] <Augus7717> you wont know LUL
[4:34:19] <+678saintglock> man, does this game even have a sequence
[4:34:19] <SubjectX07x> @PatStaresAt I fought Radahn before speaking to Blaidd or doing the entire first half of Ranni's quest and it still went through just fine.
[4:34:28] <+678saintglock> hadd to tell sometimes
[4:34:32] <+678saintglock> hard*
[4:34:32] <%Monkeyweed21> Did you ever think you would spend over 4 solid hours on stream doing nothing but a SINGLE side quest in a souls game?
[4:34:33] <%shootbang_exe> no the inverted tower is super important

[4:37:01] <rosabellamelantha> @PatStaresAt talk to her at most graces in this area she has some good dialogue explaining things
[4:37:01] <+eanscrale> Who's the real witch now?
[4:37:12] <SubjectX07x> @Dakuu75 Kinda spoilery but I believe she is the "This is my own shit to deal with" kind of gal.
[4:37:14] <%Bluwizard21> @PatStaresAt Talk to her at each grace from here on out for her story, but you need the item in the tower at the end of the study hall to finish her quest
[4:37:19] <bassoontyphoon> which witch is which???
[4:37:21] <ape_hawk> did we piss her off?
[4:37:25] <%TurtlesAndTentacles> @Kevlar_Caviar Thats here real body?! The doll?!
[4:37:26] <rosabellamelantha> She has a LOT of story
[4:37:27] <RubberFistFight> @PatStaresAt re: the evergaol thing, it does depend on which point in the quest you're at. I may become "that guy" again, but nothing bad will happen if you go look.
[4:37:35] <%AsherCaelum> Talk to the doll several times
[4:37:42] <+Edrem> @TurtlesAndTentacles her real body is dead at the top of divine tower

[4:38:36] <SubjectX07x> The quests in this game are FAR less bullshit convoluted than DS3's secret ending.
[4:38:40] <oda_flobunaga> I did this entire area but missed the doll.
[4:38:56] <+Edrem> @TurtlesAndTentacles demigod death is complicated, I think she did it to break free from two fingers
[4:38:56] <%Monkeyweed21> why did Pat unequip his spells?
[4:38:59] <+alphonseisbest> How is this game SO FULL of GOOD content?
[4:39:02] <oda_flobunaga> @PatStaresAt Progressing the new parts of this zone will progress ranni's quest.
[4:39:09] <Varanoo> could the invisibility spell help here?
[4:39:13] <@Spydurman> @PatStaresAt what's your hour count on the game atm?
[4:39:18] <%TurtlesAndTentacles> @Edrem That would make sense
[4:39:19] <+pectusumbra> Is that howl actually good? I know you were saying madness is only good vs characters and all
[4:39:27] <SubjectX07x> @Monkeyweed21 Was fighting a boss, unequipped em so the mimic tear would stop using em.
[4:39:33] <+xerj> Colossus 16
[4:39:34] <rosabellamelantha> Real Talk Ranni has so much unique content she's the only one that feels like a "true" ending

[4:40:02] <oda_flobunaga> Madness rocks against NPC's too.  It locks them down for a second and opens them up for other combos
[4:40:15] <SubjectX07x> I felt so fucking bad when I literally accidentally stumbled into the frenzied flame stuff because I realized "Oh fuck... oh shit I gotta fix this."
[4:40:26] <SubjectX07x> And fix it I did... but that fix was not easy.
[4:40:47] <%TurtlesAndTentacles> the Antlion
[4:40:49] <Augus7717> the fix for that is nuts to figure out

[4:41:09] <SubjectX07x> @Augus7717 Nuts to figure out, even harder to actually DO.

[4:42:38] <+pectusumbra> did your mimic just inflict madness on you?
[4:42:39] <+marlborored5> @PatStaresAt what does madness do?
[4:42:40] <jubejube56> why is every flower the worse thing ever?
[4:42:42] <+Edrem> @RubberFistFight is there any guide on reversing decision or does the game actually tell you how? thinking of doing it now
[4:42:42] <rosabellamelantha> those flowers are NEVER worth attacking
[4:42:43] <%greasypete00> i thought the liurnia flowers were annoying
[4:42:45] <Ravingpyro> SPARTA!
[4:42:45] <MidnightPacif1c> gj greg
[4:42:46] <AgnusLaplace> "lol" said the mimic, "lmao"
[4:42:47] <SubjectX07x> @luftraumm1 There is but very VERY late.
[4:42:49] <XxMoliciousxX> sparta flower
[4:42:50] <fortheboyzs> killed by flowers LUL
[4:42:52] <rosabellamelantha> some ennemies in this game are like not worth it
[4:42:53] <yyyyfdugyu> :tf:
[4:42:56] <tanarath> did greg do a thing?
[4:43:00] <%AyotoCorp> It's Frenzy+
[4:43:02] <vVAstrAVv> a lot in this game isnt worth attacking
[4:43:04] <haisho> Greg went a little too wild
[4:43:04] <imthewisejanitor> Thou art Greg, and Greg thou art.
[4:43:04] <%dekkitout> Worse frenzy, got it
[4:43:16] <RubberFistFight> @RubberFistFight there is a guide, yes. just google "frenzied flame questline" if you don't mind spoilers.
[4:43:22] <%doc_ock_rokc> @PatStaresAt did you Hear woolie ran into an illusionary wall? and lost his mind
[4:43:24] <niffinbox> hot dawg thats fast
[4:43:29] <%ScreamLord> It's Bloodborne Frenzy + Paralysis
[4:43:31] <binku_muja_> It seems like the flowers are more of a way to trick the player into wasting resources and health.
[4:43:32] <vVAstrAVv> "oh you beat a war god who froze thr cosmos, run from this old ass bear"
[4:43:35] <+LandOfTheWay> no
[4:43:36] <rosabellamelantha> No
[4:43:38] <%Kevlar_Caviar> nope
[4:43:38] <SubjectX07x> I believe so
[4:43:41] <+Shimano232> no, i don't think so
[4:43:43] <SubjectX07x> No?
[4:43:43] <Augus7717> no
[4:43:55] <+Shimano232> I killed her and still have the option for it
[4:43:57] <SubjectX07x> Hmm, she shows up down there but maybe it's not.
[4:43:58] <%Kevlar_Caviar> iirc you can do the frenzied flame ending without doing ANY sidequests
[4:43:58] <rosabellamelantha> it's definitely not
[4:44:02] <%MaybeFalco> for this area? no
[4:44:03] <SubjectX07x> Twould seem I have become, the one guy.
[4:44:05] <+Edrem> I think hyetta is just the in game hint to get naked for quest
[4:44:07] <VallerinTerra> As someone who did Frenzied flame, who?
[4:44:07] <%Bluwizard21> you would think
[4:44:10] <+LandOfTheWay> @patstaresat hyetta's quest provides context to that ending and gives a special seal, but it isn't required for the ending
[4:44:11] <sirrice77> I don't think theres anything that actually prevents you from doing it, you just have to find it
[4:44:16] <Midnight188> seems doing the Frenzy Flame quest may break that summon but idfk
[4:44:17] <+chaggles> I finished the game at 150
[4:44:18] <%greasypete00> i got invaded by vyke before i had given her all the things and she accepted both so you may be bugged @PatStaresAt
[4:44:19] <WillSin4Cash> what's broken with it? maybe but maybe not lol
[4:44:21] <binku_muja_> You say that now, but you've been proven wrong with an enemies bs attacks.
[4:44:21] <%luftraumm1> did you read the harpoon you got from these fuckers?

[4:44:32] <bassoontyphoon> The legend87???
[4:44:33] <SaltyAzteca> Giant ant wtf....
[4:44:34] <Wakerz140> There's lots of really cool shit you get for doing this quest
[4:44:39] <%Monkeyweed21> madness boosting seal
[4:44:39] <+Hyphixsys> Ants Canada
[4:44:40] <%ScreamLord> THEM
[4:44:42] <Hunk_Of_Dunk> is that the talisman seal that scales miracles with literally everything?
[4:44:45] <ChunLoArt> tho I didn't lvl up much
[4:44:48] <+LandOfTheWay> @patstaresat Seal of Frenzied Flame, scales with every stat and boosts madness incantations
[4:44:48] <%AyotoCorp> @vVAstrAVv You beat multiple literal demigods with magic powers over life and the cosmos, and this half-dead dog killed you
[4:44:50] <SubjectX07x> @ChunLoArt Lol I was level 145 when I ended.
[4:44:56] <%dekkitout> A giant ant is possibly the most normal thing in this game
[4:44:57] <%Kevlar_Caviar> dynastic not dynamic
[4:44:58] <rosabellamelantha> @PatStaresAt you're actually the perfect level for this and the next part of Ranni's quest believe it or not, it's just most people overlevel this
[4:45:05] <Augus7717> @PatStaresAt the frenzied flame ending can be done no matter what you do to NPCs.
[4:45:05] <%luftraumm1> maybe they are earlier trials at mimics?
[4:45:16] <KasiCrafter> Was that weapon a JoJo reference
[4:45:18] <+Mrbaconator> wow these enemies are FUCKING GROSS
[4:45:25] <SaltyAzteca> Yo pour one out for the insect phobes LUL

[4:45:46] <%SveriSageAdvice> you'll know what the queen looks like
[4:45:47] <RubberFistFight> @WillSin4Cash Festering Fingerprint Vyke isn't spawning, but it's unclear if it's because it's a bug, or if it's because Pat's doing the frenzied flame stuff himself. There's frustratingly little info on it.
[4:45:47] <+Edrem> the bloodstains LUL
[4:45:51] <XxMoliciousxX> lol "over leveled"

[4:48:10] <%BlueLunecy> I like your funny words magic sword
[4:48:11] <ALazo> alien bugs
[4:48:12] <SaltyAzteca> I dont wanna say aliens...
[4:48:14] <rosabellamelantha> @PatStaresAt so the reason they died was cus of THOSE THINGS you've been killing not divine punishment
[4:48:21] <jubejube56> so nokron died to the "naturalborn of the void"
[4:48:25] <jubejube56> shoulda had tree religion
[4:48:31] <vVAstrAVv> aaaaalienssss
[4:48:36] <%luftraumm1> look naturalborn of the void is a fancy way of saying aliens
[4:48:37] <%Kevlar_Caviar> it'll get explained in a bit
[4:48:37] <mike2hands> HUZZA
[4:48:38] <+wizard_of_diamonds> It wasn't always underground, right?

[4:48:41] <binku_muja_> @SveriSageAdvice fromsoft has really upped the ante with player paranoia this time around. It's impressive.
[4:48:42] <+BeatBoxersDevMike> the aliens hate the ants
[4:48:42] <XxMoliciousxX> bloodborne the old republic?
[4:48:44] <%TheGuesty> Maybe the Meteorite was a spaceship
[4:48:45] <+pectusumbra> I'm guessing
[4:48:48] <SubjectX07x> Oh BOY is there elements of the cosmic.
[4:48:48] <MidnightPacif1c> Naturalborn of the Void. not aliens.
[4:48:49] <%dekkitout> Some say Kosm ic
[4:48:51] <%Kevlar_Caviar> and by "a bit" i mean REAL SOON
[4:48:55] <+xerj> gravity magic, conqueror of the stars, good shit
[4:48:57] <Parapattern> Cosmic horror is a deep well
[4:49:01] <%Bluwizard21> elements he says

[4:50:58] <DracaenaLeaf> Hot dogs are my favorite form of death

[4:51:03] <+Hyphixsys> Visions of Hotdog
[4:51:06] <SubjectX07x> There are two fingers, there are three fingers, this lore is fuckin wild.
[4:51:08] <Parapattern> Hot Dog Incursion
[4:51:09] <%JoshManVGH> And the two fingers orchestrated the assassination of the demigods?
[4:51:12] <+BeatBoxersDevMike> visions of dog
[4:51:14] <%whyskeywolfe> He shipped those dogs in overnight from Vermont.
[4:51:16] <+tizziks> Ranni is a ghost in a doll.  That's how she can interact
[4:51:20] <sirrice77> @Sigma_190_Beta yes? like did you not goto the top of a divine tower and see a dead one?
[4:51:21] <imthewisejanitor> Two Hot Dogs.
[4:51:26] <SubjectX07x> Honestly, beating this game has only left me wanting so much more.
[4:51:27] <rosabellamelantha> @binku_muja_ she killed her flesh, to prevent full death she killed Godfrey's soul at the same time
[4:51:31] <SubjectX07x> I want to see more of this new world.
[4:51:32] <rudiciuscaesar> Aren't there 5, like, legit, they were part of a schism, and prior to that they were the hand or something, that is NOT lore, to my knowledge, someone said it and it's all I remember, is it real lore? lol
[4:51:37] <%jamsbybetty> this is good lore I'm getting 'cuz I am going down a very different path lmao
[4:51:37] <Sunstalker> are the two fingers and the three fingers from the same hand? 🤔
[4:51:40] <rosabellamelantha> So that's why Godfrey is the prince of death
[4:52:02] <rudiciuscaesar> @Sunstalker yeah, that's what I'm asking too lol. Sounds like they were all one group then split
[4:52:33] <%TurtlesAndTentacles> 2 fingers that look like aliens and star items. Hmmmmmmm
[4:52:37] <+Hyphixsys> catJAM
[4:52:43] <SubjectX07x> @Sunstalker Honestly, I think so, the two fingers is shown as an index and middle finger, if I recall the three fingers was shown as the pinky ring and thumb.
[4:52:59] <+Hyphixsys> coxJam coxJam coxJam
[4:53:19] <+BeatBoxersDevMike> boy do i not have a clue what the lore of this game is
[4:53:20] <rudiciuscaesar> yeah, see, thought that was the deal
[4:53:22] <imthewisejanitor> Guys, what if FING3RS is one of the Two Fingers???
[4:53:28] <rudiciuscaesar> but what I don't know is what the fingers actually do lol.
[4:53:51] <SubjectX07x> Tbh, I beat the game and I'm still unsure what the fingers deal is.
[4:53:52] <+Hyphixsys> @imthewisejanitor the what Jebaited
[4:53:56] <%Ynkubus_> @rudiciuscaesar  finger but hole, duh
[4:53:57] <rosabellamelantha> the game is actually pretty clear cut on its lore
[4:53:59] <rosabellamelantha> surprisingly
[4:54:05] <rosabellamelantha> you just have to search for most of it
[4:54:08] <binku_muja_> weird question but what were the fingers originally a part of?
[4:54:15] <~PatStaresAt> hey guys so how's woolies run going
[4:54:19] <~PatStaresAt> what's he been doin
[4:54:25] <+tizziks> @rudiciuscaesar Probably going to be the hand of some elder god celestial nightmare or something.
[4:54:30] <+AyupaPupa> becoming vergil
[4:54:33] <radiorosewater> @PatStaresAt he's vergil now i think
[4:54:39] <$0ddeye> Why are their dead fingers at the top of the great rune towers?
[4:54:39] <rosabellamelantha> uh last I checked he was becoming vergil
[4:54:51] <binku_muja_> According to another commenter he found an illusory wall and went nuts.
[4:54:52] <imthewisejanitor> @Hyphixsys You know, Fing3rs, the guy who did the song. He's a finger.
[4:55:08] <radiorosewater> @PatStaresAt he does magic shit? i dunno it's wierd chocco
[4:55:09] <%dekkitout> Is the sword spell going him any good?
[4:55:15] <Happydisaster> I think the fingers aren’t actually fingers, that’s gonna be the twist.
[4:55:25] <%luftraumm1> @PatStaresAt he's gonna take so long o go through this game
[4:55:39] <radiorosewater> sword spell works good with greatsword
[4:55:41] <+DrFacilier> @PatStaresAt he found the roundtable and fought scythe guy
[4:55:48] <radiorosewater> @PatStaresAt birds should follow
[4:56:05] <+BeatBoxersDevMike> the hard part about magic is that you have no idea where any spells are and most you get are worse than your starter pebble
[4:56:37] <zhenthrim213> so just finished Rannis quest
[4:56:41] <zhenthrim213> oh boi
[4:57:19] <RyuuAoi> Pat been at it for a while?
[4:57:32] <+DrFacilier> I only made one character so far Dex/Vit how are the other builds?
[4:57:39] <imthewisejanitor> Pat is taking a break from playing a story about Two Fingers, while eating finger-like food, with his fingers, and playing a song by Fing3rs. csbeastSetIn csbeastSetIn csbeastSetIn
[4:58:01] <binku_muja_> LUL
[4:58:24] <+DrFacilier> Like is it better to go two different offensive stats like Int/Str or all in on one stat?
[4:58:24] <NewWillinium> Magic has been real rough for me in my playthrough. For almost entirely the reasons that BoxersDevMike said.  Also I'm at that point of the build where my stats are so spread out to be viable that I'm not hitting hard enough *or* as tanky or have enough FP as I would wish.
[4:58:26] <pi_in_the_sci> @DrFacilier This game seems to want you to go either INT or FTH, it's really easy to tie your damage to any stat you want
[4:58:29] <+BeatBoxersDevMike> i beat the game with just str, the crazy humansized bosses are real tough but everything else melts
[4:59:35] <zhenthrim213> @DrFacilier  im Str/fth like pat and seems really strong beacause im tanking most shit
[4:59:38] <NewWillinium> There are spells that require Faith and Int by the way. I've found one so far
[4:59:39] <+BeatBoxersDevMike> late game magic/faith probably succeeds in pve better than others
[4:59:54] <$0ddeye> @BeatBoxersDevMike I beat it with strength as well, found dual wielding greatswords just deleted even the secret end bosses.
[5:00:16] <zhenthrim213> also ROT breath is a boss killer
[5:00:45] <+DrFacilier> @zhenthrim213 all the faith shit ive found make me wanna do that build
[5:01:15] <XxMoliciousxX> anyone else watching lobos trying to figure out a boss for his SL1 run?
[5:01:19] <@Ranryu692> this game seems to favor Strength and Faith, at least early-ish on
[5:01:23] <zhenthrim213> @DrFacilier im using the golden halbred and Rahdans armor
[5:01:34] <+BeatBoxersDevMike> imma prob respec to make a proper vergil, dex gets all the fun toys
[5:01:39] <zhenthrim213> with a greatsheild
[5:01:47] <pi_in_the_sci> INT is cool, but it feels like %80 of their spells are the same thing
[5:01:53] <NewWillinium> Faith does seem a LOT more interesting then INT at the moment in my playthrough. But INT is still fun
[5:02:02] <doster504> @BeatBoxersDevMike how did you guys do more than 1 damage to anything at the end I'm level 150 and I barely scratch shit
[5:02:18] <%SaiyanShoto> To me visually int stuff looks cooler than a lot of faith stuff
[5:02:26] <+BeatBoxersDevMike> i use a bleed str weap
[5:02:29] <TrashManRising> VoteYea VoteYea VoteYea
[5:02:32] <%captain_thickthighs> @patstaresat so no witch queen?
[5:02:35] <+TDotGoat> how was hotdogs?
[5:02:43] <%SaiyanShoto> I also feel like the game favors dex since I’ve gotten like 90% dex weapons

[5:04:25] <SubjectX07x> ??? I didn't join the bloody fingers to fight that guy.
[5:04:28] <+Kyma1020> it isn't
[5:04:29] <NewWillinium> Oh speaking of which, Did you ever go back to kill Satan?
[5:04:30] <sirrice77> @tentavision you dont?
[5:04:31] <pi_in_the_sci> Maybe they'll go back after you kill him
[5:04:31] <+hakumaribo> is this still the place the meteor fell?
[5:04:35] <+Fenrisulfr_V> @PatStaresAt There's a teleporter that also gets you there.
[5:04:37] <rudiciuscaesar> More important, Pat, how was the hotdogs?
[5:04:44] <%Kevlar_Caviar> @SubjectX07x you can go to him early if you do varre's quest
[5:04:48] <Midnight188> @PatStaresAt you can get to the blood boss the normal way through a portal in a future area
[5:04:49] <sirrice77> @tentavision oh i read that wrong, book for it is in liurnia near artists shack
[5:04:59] <+BeatBoxersDevMike> i guess it was cause i was trying futilely to make a str build using a shield and fatrolling with the heaviest armor
[5:05:00] <+xerj> those are some cool ladies
[5:05:08] <+BeatBoxersDevMike> better to get inquick and get out
[5:05:18] <Midnight188> its hiding in an area reached by completing the broken talisman
[5:05:20] <SubjectX07x> @Kevlar_Caviar Oh, yeah I just fought him by using the waystone in the consecrated snowlands, which. Maybe that's why he's not that tough.
[5:05:21] <%Brassnarwhal> @sirrice77 how near are we talking
[5:05:25] <rosabellamelantha> aren't these dudes the sellia bosses?
[5:05:25] <%tentavision> @sirrice77 thanks

[5:05:48] <%Kevlar_Caviar> i love it
[5:05:58] <SomeAsianDood> what madman designed those things
[5:06:00] <sirrice77> @Brassnarwhal So the gold knight walking on the road in front of the artists shack on the eastern path of liurnia drops the book
[5:06:01] <%discoinfierno> I would buy a snake snail plushie
[5:06:15] <SubjectX07x> Pat's doing a faith build not an int build right?
[5:06:21] <%kknutson4> so dual wield both
[5:06:24] <$0ddeye> Even right now if pat put a second great sword on and just started hitting L1 instead of R1 its a double damage increase
[5:06:24] <rudiciuscaesar> were those electric chus back there?
[5:06:27] <%Brassnarwhal> @sirrice77 thanky
[5:06:27] <+BeatBoxersDevMike> pump luck

[5:06:33] <SubjectX07x> Hmmm, so no Moonlight Greatsword then, shame.
[5:06:43] <%dekkitout> I thought Jesus knew kung fu?
[5:06:44] <zhenthrim213> if jesus was down with the devil
[5:06:58] <sirrice77> @Brassnarwhal np lightning spear requires 17 faith
[5:07:04] <+hakumaribo> the moonlight greatsword is a bitch to get
[5:07:28] <+BeatBoxersDevMike> snaikels or snailks?
[5:07:31] <zhenthrim213> @hakumaribo yea just got it your right
[5:07:44] <%Brassnarwhal> @sirrice77 oh i have like 34 faith I'm currently in the god fire mountain area i just couldn't find the dude with the book

[5:16:19] <niffinbox> definitly kept me entertained when I was in hospital for days
[5:16:20] <Hunk_Of_Dunk> I like the streams because I can't really justify getting the game right now, so being able to experience it is good and fun
[5:16:20] <imthewisejanitor> Sweeeeeaty bussy.
[5:16:21] <RubberFistFight> man, pat, if your ocd didn't kick into overdrive every so often, they wouldn't really be "Pat streams" anymore.
[5:16:32] <RubberFistFight> I'm not sure if anyone who's been around for a while really has a problem with it.
[5:16:39] <@Spydurman> D's quest for Saw con
[5:16:42] <sleepystardewfarmer> That's..... that's fine. ............... That's fine.
[5:16:48] <bassoontyphoon> Who needs to douche when your bussy is sopping from all that sweat
[5:16:54] <binku_muja_> Not for long.
[5:16:56] <bassoontyphoon> Who I hate myself for writing that
[5:17:01] <$0ddeye> It's nice to see a streamer who isn't using a super busted build like the sword of flame and night and then bragging about beating bosses without summons
[5:17:05] <NBUsagi> Yoo ribbon sword

[5:18:01] <SubjectX07x> Which sword?
[5:18:02] <rudiciuscaesar> but never using the cool summons, so you willfully don't use part of hte game you payed for?
[5:18:05] <penitentpendant> The two handed shield slam
[5:18:07] <%epide> think about the changes to scaling and its a qual build wepon
[5:18:08] <yyyyfdugyu> average bonk enjoyer
[5:18:09] <%Monkeyweed21> Its the greatest quality weapon in the series maybe
[5:18:12] <rudiciuscaesar> paid*
[5:18:17] <rudiciuscaesar> lmao Jesus, I'm tired.
[5:18:18] <$0ddeye> It's weapon art is Azur Comet and it just melts bosses
[5:18:18] <sirrice77> @SubjectX07x sword of night and flame
[5:18:19] <+alphonseisbest> @SaintSalted NAH THE fire attack also SLAPS
[5:18:23] <akitanito> welp
[5:18:24] <%SveriSageAdvice> i thought Woolie wanted Moonveil
[5:18:32] <+pectusumbra> oooo, the curved sword hits are damaging you through block
[5:18:38] <%TurtlesAndTentacles> she too fast Mayne
[5:18:45] <rosabellamelantha> I swapped to the MGS specifically because I was tired of melting everything
[5:18:49] <%BinaryFireball> oh nice you made it down here
[5:18:49] <NewWillinium> It is a Shotel
[5:18:50] <RubberFistFight> @alphonseisbest the only time it bugs me is when it's a direct result of him listening to bad advice over good, like what happened with nioh. And then it's more about the bad advice itself than anything else.
[5:18:53] <djblue_shift> yeah seems like it's a shotel type
[5:18:57] <+pectusumbra> the whip doesn't but it's a classic hook sword it seems
[5:18:58] <%BinaryFireball> this imo is the prettiest area in the game
[5:18:59] <%Monkeyweed21> it turns into a shotel
[5:19:00] <Hunk_Of_Dunk> Can someone explain the phrase "Quality Build/Quality Weapon" to me? Is it just something that's really good but takes a shitton of stat investment?
[5:19:04] <jubejube56> If I understand the hype correctly that sword basically has a better version of your "the queen's black flame"
[5:19:09] <SubjectX07x> Moonveil is very strong and amazing for spellswords so Woolie would benefit greatly from it.
[5:19:11] <NBUsagi> lol raw aggressoin
[5:19:12] <+Mrbaconator> oh so that sword is called that, ye that weapon is fucked up for real
[5:19:16] <%luftraumm1> pat do you care about your channel having more GROWTH?
[5:19:22] <%Puhff> shotel deez nuts
[5:19:26] <%Monkeyweed21> ANTS
[5:19:26] <%Brassnarwhal> it's because whips always negate shield
[5:19:26] <%Kevlar_Caviar> OOOOO
[5:19:29] <+alphonseisbest> @RubberFistFight  yes very much tghe same
[5:19:29] <%thelaxinator> Apparently Netflix is dropping Star Trek TNG next month, good thing I have a dvd set…
[5:19:30] <GenericTwitchAcc1> SHIELD BASH
[5:19:31] <doster504> @Hunk_Of_Dunk Quality usually means dex and str but it could probably just mean multi stat now
[5:19:38] <+alphonseisbest> ANTS IN YOUR PANTS
[5:19:39] <%Puhff> DA LORE
[5:19:48] <Augus7717> bash em with the and head

[5:20:30] <Strigiform> the cascading slimes explosions might be my newer favorite farm spot
[5:20:30] <+BeatBoxersDevMike> boom shaka laka
[5:20:36] <RubberFistFight> I don't think he's struggling for growth at all.
[5:20:39] <%discoinfierno> "night maiden" pah I know medieval cat girl ears when I see them
[5:20:48] <RubberFistFight> he's got a consistent fanbase which is far better than "number go up"
[5:20:50] <niffinbox> pat is a growin boy
[5:21:08] <$0ddeye> @luftraumm1 90% of twitch is Elden Ring and lots of kids are busy watching their fortnite streamers instead of Souls vets like Pat
[5:21:11] <%luftraumm1> @RubberFistFight but how could he(we?) break that "wall"?
[5:21:16] <%Monkeyweed21> they have shields
[5:21:20] <+pectusumbra> liquid metal phalanx
[5:21:21] <%Kevlar_Caviar> this game is a love letter to everything fromsoft's ever made
[5:21:21] <%Piemen99> aw that one has a shield
[5:21:28] <%Brassnarwhal> @strigiform near the ladder into the plateau you can cascade those giant poison crabs, their poison clouds blow eachother up
[5:21:32] <+NeonFishFace> theyre kinda cute
[5:21:35] <$dellakitty> melee jellies? What
[5:21:35] <RubberFistFight> @luftraumm1 what wall? wtf are you talking about?
[5:21:41] <%luftraumm1> @RubberFistFight for sure, thats why i asked if he wanted "growth"
[5:21:44] <vile_brand> man Elden ring is like literally everything that people liked about every fromsoft game
[5:21:49] <%AyotoCorp> YEYEYE

[5:22:20] <+Mrbaconator> BABY GRAMPA
[5:22:22] <%BinaryFireball> every souls game is a love letter to their previous games. I would call it masturbatory but I love their games too so...lol
[5:22:26] <%luftraumm1> @RubberFistFight the wall of 2-3k viewers, but i imagine theres too much i dont understand about the medium
[5:22:29] <Augus7717> Who knows LUL
[5:22:36] <+extantCadence> You missed the first one
[5:22:43] <%AyotoCorp> @PatStaresAt It's back in Nokron
[5:22:44] <+False_Being> this is a pretty video game
[5:22:47] <%Kevlar_Caviar> @PatStaresAt apparently it's on a corpse back in nokron
[5:22:54] <%Puhff> emlo
[5:23:02] <RubberFistFight> @luftraumm1 yeah, there really is. there's no "wall" to "break".
[5:23:03] <@Spydurman> Nokron deez nuts
[5:23:07] <penitentpendant> Yeah, you can miss a lot in that place
[5:23:11] <%Monkeyweed21> You have to beat the Longma
[5:23:19] <Augus7717> you can tell they put in the work after bluepoint put out the DS remake LUL
[5:23:24] <ape_hawk> nokron deez nuts
[5:23:26] <ape_hawk> wait
[5:23:39] <UmoLoco> Rate the messages bro
[5:23:40] <RubberFistFight> when you're consistently pulling in hundreds if not thousands of viewers for EVERY STREAM, you're already over any kind of "wall" and into the area where consistency wins. And he's got that. @luftraumm1
[5:23:44] <%Kevlar_Caviar> man i really like the texturing on those dudes
[5:24:01] <%Puhff> this place is weird af
[5:24:09] <%BinaryFireball> true
[5:24:15] <%JustTheGuyYouNeed> yes
[5:24:16] <%BinaryFireball> i have +9 uniques
[5:24:21] <rosabellamelantha> yeah thats an issue
[5:24:22] <%BinaryFireball> but no 20 lvl regular
[5:24:23] <+SaintSalted> yea i can level 3 uniques for every nromal
[5:24:23] <+lord_sykos> Yeah because you only need 1 of each
[5:24:26] <Sunstalker> omfg I just learned you can backstab the dudes in the flame chariots
[5:24:28] <$0ddeye> The lack of mimics?
[5:24:41] <+Mrbaconator> I upgraded 2 weapons with standard stones to plus 18 each it cost me over 540K and I even already had some stones
[5:24:47] <UmoLoco> Thank you for rating the message. We live in a society lol
[5:24:47] <OldOnyx> to same extent as DS1 with slabs/chunks vs twinkling?
[5:24:53] <%BinaryFireball> go back side of it
[5:24:57] <%Monkeyweed21> yea but normal weapons have the entire ashes system
[5:25:12] <+Edrem> normals with art of wars are so much more versatile now though
[5:25:12] <$0ddeye> Standard weapons are better because of ash customization
[5:25:24] <+SaintSalted> but i noticed that the claymore seems to scale insanely with anything, with blood it does 115 bleed
[5:25:25] <vVAstrAVv> time for rolling
[5:25:28] <SomeAsianDood> they aren't hostile?
[5:25:29] <%luftraumm1> @RubberFistFight yeah, most of the streamers i watch either have around 2-3k viewers or 10s of thousands, i don't know what each does different, but as a viewer i much prefer this situation right here where there is some interaction going on
[5:25:30] <%Pyon84> They don't mind
[5:25:30] <jubejube56> Imagine going somewhere without a stone sword key
[5:25:31] <%ahdurian> the sneakiest
[5:25:34] <+SaintSalted> at +25
[5:25:37] <%BinaryFireball> i think normals have a bit of advantage because you can enchant with bleed etc... too
[5:25:40] <ape_hawk> pretty sneaky, sis
[5:25:42] <Wakerz140> It's odd but those two don't attack if you don't start a fight
[5:25:56] <%luftraumm1> @RubberFistFight the consistency of pat's streams is really something
[5:26:03] <%Monkeyweed21> @jubejube56 imagine not buying every stonesword key you find so you have 7 at all times
[5:26:05] <$0ddeye> Pat why don't you two hand while you're not throwing magic

[5:42:10] <%Bluwizard21> @PatStaresAt There was a side path to a golden see up ther
[5:42:12] <yyyyfdugyu> dont talk to me or my son ever again
[5:42:14] <Sigma_190_Beta> @epide He is.
[5:42:18] <$dellakitty> @Brassnarwhal do scarabs roll poop
[5:42:20] <%Bluwizard21> seed
[5:42:24] <niffinbox> MORE SLOTS BBY
[5:42:28] <%Brassnarwhal> @epide it costs a consumable on every death and you have to play multiplayer to get more
[5:42:31] <%Bluwizard21> i tried
[5:42:34] <%Brassnarwhal> @dellakitty some do yes
[5:42:42] <%TurtlesAndTentacles> Does Ranni Talk in here?
[5:42:43] <%BinaryFireball> womp womp
[5:42:45] <%Pyon84> wow
[5:42:51] <rosabellamelantha> @PatStaresAt no worries pat you get OVER the amount of seeds you need by endgame to make sure that you have max if you explored
[5:43:05] <%BinaryFireball> yea mimics are special boys
[5:43:10] <bassoontyphoon> I can’t believe bluwizard would do this to the stream
[5:43:13] <vVAstrAVv> oh my fucking GOD... i didnt know you could use the table as a grace
[5:43:24] <Sigma_190_Beta> There's something you should know is an option for the girl.
[5:43:24] <$0ddeye> You should really grab another sword and do some power stancing, its incredibly powerful
[5:43:25] <%BinaryFireball> wait you can????
[5:43:28] <SubjectX07x> WAIT YOU CAN!?
[5:43:29] <%BinaryFireball> god damn it
[5:43:38] <SubjectX07x> I beat the god damn game and didn't know this..
[5:43:38] <$dellakitty> @Brassnarwhal so they are dung beetles, "technically" lol
[5:43:40] <LuckyTerry> Which realm is Greg from? Kappa LUL
[5:43:54] <%Brassnarwhal> @dellakitty yes
[5:44:02] <+extantCadence> It seems weird to me that the ghost glovewort seems easier to get than the regular one
[5:44:03] <SubjectX07x> NotLikeThis
[5:44:10] <%Brassnarwhal> @luckyterry the one where they don't have beards
[5:44:18] <%Valdorick> By the way Pat, every 3 upgrades, Shields gain +1 stability... just incase you're even overflowing with smithing stones
[5:44:18] <Sigma_190_Beta> What is there's something you should know?
[5:44:19] <%Kevlar_Caviar> you can upgrade oleg AND mimic
[5:44:23] <%JoshManVGH> I really like that the somber weapons are one shard per level
[5:44:25] <%Kevlar_Caviar> nvm
[5:44:28] <SubjectX07x> Mimic literally beats every other ash hands down tbh.
[5:44:29] <+Mrbaconator> where is the mimic one
[5:44:30] <%TurtlesAndTentacles> The Night Maiden. Not like the Day Madien
[5:44:30] <%dekkitout> Gregg shall be the most of huge
[5:44:39] <chowndawg> runes
[5:44:43] <SubjectX07x> It's just hilariously strong by comparison.
[5:44:50] <LuckyTerry> lol
[5:44:52] <%Valdorick> Rot Hounds?
[5:44:52] <$realm_forge> Pat loves playing with himself on stream
[5:44:52] <%Brassnarwhal> i have more ghost than grave glovewort
[5:44:57] <+cigsmcgrigs> Shield guys are pretty good
[5:45:02] <%luftraumm1> crtial fucker would be good for tanking]
[5:45:04] <Paperware> I hear shield boys are pretty good
[5:45:07] <Happydisaster> Mimics lame
[5:45:08] <jubejube56> You did like jelly fish
[5:45:17] <$0ddeye> Have you found the Guts summon yet?
[5:45:28] <haisho> Friendship has ended with Oleg
[5:45:34] <SubjectX07x> @0ddeye Guts summon?
[5:45:34] <%Valdorick> Friendship with Oleg over, Mimic Tear is Pat's new best friend
[5:45:36] <+ZaheerMyHomeBoy> Can you buy stuff for the sword?
[5:45:38] <Ravingpyro> Guts summon?!
[5:45:40] <RubberFistFight> @PatStaresAt fitting that your new friend is basically a copy of you Kappa
[5:45:45] <%Brassnarwhal> gregg is my new best friend
[5:45:50] <penitentpendant> On no, the Dr. Robotnik meme with the Mimic
[5:45:52] <%Valdorick> Did he just take tear to +10?
[5:45:55] <fierysnowflakes> Speedrun strats, LEST FUCKING GOOOOOOO
[5:45:58] <+LandOfTheWay> @PatStaresAt can weapon buff sorceries/incantations like electrify weapon work on unique/boss weapons?
[5:46:03] <%Brassnarwhal> @valdorick 7
[5:46:15] <%greasypete00> mimic tear
[5:46:16] <$0ddeye> @SubjectX07x The art is clearly berserker armor guts, glowing red eye
[5:46:16] <%Brassnarwhal> @landoftheway no
[5:46:17] <LuckyTerry> Does this game have STANDS?
[5:46:28] <RubberFistFight> i wonder. does the mimic know it's a mimic? or is it thrust into some existential hell where it's not sure if it's the clone or the real one?
[5:46:35] <SubjectX07x> Oh, I think I know who you're talking about now.
[5:46:51] <SubjectX07x> The bloodhound knight one?
[5:47:03] <iswearimjustdandy> @rubberfistfight thats a w.i.t.c.h. storyline
[5:47:17] <DanThePumpkinman> you still faithing pat? or just strength now?
[5:47:20] <$0ddeye> @SubjectX07x Yeah just not trying to be too spoilery, but found that summon pretty good
[5:47:23] <+LandOfTheWay> so basically, if it already does some bonus damage it can be buffed with any more
[5:47:31] <+LandOfTheWay> *can't
[5:47:47] <DracaenaLeaf> walks away LUL
[5:47:52] <tolloponik> ditto I choose You!
[5:47:52] <LuckyTerry> I will make a Lucky Ted build, MLK = Magic,Luck,Knife.
[5:48:10] <rudiciuscaesar> so could the mimic throw lightning like Pat can?
[5:48:20] <rudiciuscaesar> cuz it can clearly do the sword magic lol
[5:48:24] <SubjectX07x> Yes
[5:48:25] <RubberFistFight> there needs to be an anti-lucky ted
[5:48:31] <RubberFistFight> like unlucky tom or something
[5:48:41] <SubjectX07x> It will use any bit of kit you have have on when you summon it. @rudiciuscaesar
[5:48:48] <%Valdorick> If you have a casting item on when you summon mimic tear, then it can throw lightning
[5:48:49] <$0ddeye> If you have buffing items and perfumes in your inventory it will use those too
[5:48:51] <Happydisaster> Not as much as oleg
[5:48:54] <%Valdorick> or any of pat's spells...
[5:48:56] <SubjectX07x> Spells, weapons, whatever, even gets a flask use.
[5:49:01] <Midnight188> unlucky theodore
[5:49:03] <rudiciuscaesar> @SubjectX07x that's super cool
[5:49:08] <+Catpurnicus> Jank Jimmy
[5:49:10] <%Kevlar_Caviar> @PatStaresAt i've been reading lore for this game all day and i can't get enough, it's so good
[5:49:11] <%Valdorick> its... sadly dumb as shit if you have buff spells on though... and will spam cast them while getting its face beaten in
[5:49:12] <$0ddeye> there is a perfume that gives a shield that blocks a hit and just having it in inventory will make the mimic constantly use it
[5:49:18] <rudiciuscaesar> wonder how that would do against one of those dragons
[5:49:29] <GenericTwitchAcc1> Golden Sneed
[5:49:30] <rudiciuscaesar> the AI would probably make it face fuck a dragon though
[5:49:37] <SubjectX07x> Pat is still on the detour lol.
[5:49:44] <%Valdorick> No one tell Pat he was 50 feet away from a grace, shhhhh
[5:49:58] <SubjectX07x> Oh no I don't even mean the plains.
[5:50:00] <%Valdorick> Oh good
[5:50:01] <haisho> Elden Ring has the GREATEST detours
[5:50:06] <rudiciuscaesar> Wow, got Achille's there
[5:50:07] <SubjectX07x> I mean detouring from Ranni's questline lol.
[5:50:07] <@QueequegTheater> @PatStaresAt How did you get to Moghwyn? There was a Somber ston +10 there I need
[5:50:11] <Happydisaster> IMO Oleg is still better because of the stagger he dishes out
[5:50:11] <rudiciuscaesar> Achilles'd*
[5:50:20] <jubejube56> Turtle Pope waiting room
[5:50:22] <+lemon_lore> wow that sword pretty long
[5:50:24] <KasiCrafter> How many more seeds do you need to up your flasks?
[5:50:28] <@QueequegTheater> Chat, who was the NPC?
[5:50:36] <%Bluwizard21> You don't want to get to the altus plane, It makes you realize that everything before the altus plain was maybe half the game
[5:50:44] <%Pyon84> Do it
[5:50:45] <+alphonseisbest> @QueequegTheater  varree#
[5:50:45] <LuckyTerry> Did Pat save the fair maiden that eats mustard? LUL <3
[5:50:45] <%Dakuu75> question: does the moon-lady boss give you another big rune like Goldwyn?
[5:50:49] <GhostPyre> +10 mimic tear here we come
[5:50:51] <SubjectX07x> Max tear
[5:50:52] <@QueequegTheater> @QueequegTheater appreciated
[5:50:52] <SubjectX07x> MAX tear
[5:50:53] <Strigiform> its time for the clone to become greater than the original
[5:50:54] <%Valdorick> The no Maidens guy, Queequeg
[5:50:55] <+Edrem> the guy who called you maidenless at the start, part of the whole blood fingers storyline
[5:50:57] <%BinaryFireball> you CAN
[5:50:57] <SubjectX07x> MAXIMUM TEEEEAR
[5:50:59] <+alphonseisbest> @QueequegTheater the guy from the start of the game
[5:50:59] <%dekkitout> psaBig
[5:51:00] <%BinaryFireball> and its so worth
[5:51:00] <rosabellamelantha> YEAH STRONGEST MIMIC
[5:51:01] <%JoshManVGH> Maximum Gregg!
[5:51:03] <+BeatBoxersDevMike> max power stando
[5:51:07] <@QueequegTheater> MIMIC IS SO GOOD, ISN'T HE
[5:51:16] <%Bluwizard21> Imagine you with 1/3rd your damage but 3 times your health. thats maximum gregg
[5:51:19] <%dekkitout> The boy is now strong man
[5:51:20] <chowndawg> at that point aren't you the mimic?
[5:51:21] <%luftraumm1> GReggus MNaximnus
[5:51:21] <+chaggles> A God is about to decend
[5:51:21] <%Brassnarwhal> @bluwizard21 i went to altus plain 3rd it's easier than caelid by a lot
[5:51:24] <$EsotericOdyssey> you can get to mohgwyn without doing blood "No Maidens?" man's invasion quest, it just doesn't show up until way way way later in the game
[5:51:25] <$0ddeye> @Dakuu75 Yeah you get one but it doesnt do anything technically, it just lets you respec
[5:51:28] <$EsotericOdyssey> like, after altus
[5:51:30] <imthewisejanitor> GREG 2.0??
[5:51:30] <%JoshManVGH> YEYEYE
[5:51:32] <LuckyTerry> TOO the MAX!!! <3 <3 <3
[5:51:32] <@QueequegTheater> @PatStaresAt Mimic is immune to Scarlet Rot, btw
[5:51:33] <%discoinfierno> gigagregg
[5:51:33] <tri3dgE027> STANDO POWAHHHH
[5:51:35] <+LandOfTheWay> @PatStaresAt was there a dialogue option with roderika there?
[5:51:37] <GenericTwitchAcc1> Great Greg
[5:51:38] <+BeatBoxersDevMike> [Greg Requiem]
[5:51:38] <XxMoliciousxX> kage bunshin no jutsu?
[5:51:40] <$SGrim> He is GRUG
[5:51:42] <+twdlrr> Big Greggory
[5:51:49] <+LandOfTheWay> ah, makes sense
[5:51:49] <OldOnyx> can't wait for from to nerf all this cool shit
[5:51:52] <%Dakuu75> @0ddeye ah ok, gotchya
[5:51:52] <+ZaheerMyHomeBoy> can you upgrade your sword again?
[5:51:54] <%JustTheGuyYouNeed> The mimic has surpassed the original
[5:51:54] <Paperware> Greg is so strong that Pat is probably the mimic now
[5:51:57] <+tizziks> have you talked to poo head lately?
[5:51:59] <%greasypete00> whoda thunk shit eater is a shit head
[5:51:59] <rosabellamelantha> @PatStaresAt dung eater has an ending btw which is hilarious
[5:52:00] <%Bluwizard21> @Brassnarwhal I was just sayin it is huge and so much beyond it is huge I still cant figure out how to get into volcano mano
[5:52:03] <+eanscrale> how surprising...
[5:52:04] <SubjectX07x> Dung eater is bad news, but he doesn't come up until later in the main story.
[5:52:05] <+BeatBoxersDevMike> [Greg Over Heaven]
[5:52:05] <%Valdorick> Mimic is not immune to grab attacks though, something to keep in mind
[5:52:06] <bassoontyphoon> [GREG IN HEAVEN]
[5:52:06] <%Brassnarwhal> GREGGSIMUM ORBERDRIVE
[5:52:07] <%AsherCaelum> @QueequegTheater Mimic is definitely not immune to Scarlet Rot.  Found that out the hard way during a late game superboss.
[5:52:15] <%AyotoCorp> The loathsome dungeater
[5:52:18] <%JoshManVGH> Does dung eater ever stop being a sullen fuck?
[5:52:21] <SubjectX07x> Dung Eater is like... actually the hugest fucking piece of shit ever.
[5:52:27] <%Bluwizard21> talk to dung eater and see if he has anything new
[5:52:28] <LuckyTerry> GIGA GREGG the Glorious!!! LUL LUL LUL SeemsGood
[5:52:31] <%strakillias> His name is Dung Eater, was there ever any chance of him being a good person?
[5:52:41] <GenericTwitchAcc1> yum
[5:52:42] <SubjectX07x> Like, what his role is in the story is FUCKING heinous.
[5:52:53] <%Brassnarwhal> @bluwizard21 is that different from the fire mountain? i found my way to the fire mountain
[5:52:56] <tri3dgE027> I doubt Summon Spirits will get nerfed considering you can't use them during Multiplayer
[5:53:01] <%luftraumm1> are you gonna up your dex eventually for your greatsword?
[5:53:02] <+Edrem> he won't have a new line until you find a curse seed
[5:53:02] <yyyyfdugyu> what too much ass eating does to a mfer
[5:53:06] <tolloponik> those two runes was worth the amount of one Gwen soul and he's not even done with the game
[5:53:08] <+BeatBoxersDevMike> i think mimic is immune to some stuff
[5:53:10] <luciluxlu0> the dung questline doesn't really start until the capital
[5:53:10] <%Brassnarwhal> @bluwizard21 and yeah it's fucking huge
[5:53:15] <+LandOfTheWay> @SubjectX07x i'll give him this: he's honest
[5:53:21] <@QueequegTheater> @QueequegTheater I literally saw it walk through Rot Lake for several minutes without rot proccing
[5:53:36] <%luftraumm1> oh it takes your best attribute into consideration?
[5:53:39] <+BeatBoxersDevMike> awoooo

[5:57:37] <rosabellamelantha> @PatStaresAt Blaidd's state doesnt't change till you fully beat ranni's quest
[5:57:39] <%greasypete00> by the way this seems to be the only end to blaidd's questline
[5:57:40] <RubberFistFight> Pat broke nothing. Whether or not he spoke to Blaidd makes no difference as he gets out regardless.
[5:57:44] <+pectusumbra> Is guts about to beat your ass to death?
[5:57:52] <%Mantorok06> Upstairs maybe?
[5:57:56] <LuckyTerry> blood of the wolf of the full moon clan!!! LUL LUL LUL
[5:57:56] <%JoshManVGH> So he's like... incapable of killing Ranni right?
[5:57:58] <%TurtlesAndTentacles> Youre gonna have to put him down
[5:58:00] <%Valdorick> Oh, how did Pat resolve Wizard asshole's potion quest?
[5:58:01] <+hakumaribo> i hope so

[5:58:30] <%MaybeFalco> about 10 feet
[5:58:30] <%dekkitout> My guess is a little far
[5:58:34] <%JoshManVGH> @kinkade_77 How many larva are you willing to farm?
[5:58:34] <SubjectX07x> Very, but ya gotta go deeper still.
[5:58:38] <luciluxlu0> keep digging
[5:58:38] <+CapnBeefs> This game is fucking huge

[5:59:28] <ape_hawk> so apparently, QD didnt even make the trailer for Eclipse. they hired another company to make it in hopes of getting applicants for their vacancies, but no one applied
[5:59:29] <GenericTwitchAcc1> wow racist
[5:59:32] <djblue_shift> is this gonna take you to that awful place underground
[5:59:38] <RubberFistFight> man the deathblight animation is some proper horror shit
[5:59:47] <SomeAsianDood> Fuck basilisks. All my homies hate basilisks

[6:05:37] <%SveriSageAdvice> Lost Izalith was unfinished, so that
[6:05:37] <$0ddeye> Im excited for the eventual lore discussions, the source of the rot is pretty interesting
[6:05:38] <+DrFacilier> cant you see this swamp from the first Ainsel area?
[6:05:38] <NBUsagi> Its just a poison lake
[6:05:40] <vVAstrAVv> THIS is why you cant ride horse

[6:06:14] <%TurtlesAndTentacles> MAybe she was Patience zero
[6:06:14] <%JustTheGuyYouNeed> She was born with rot

[6:06:23] <+Fenrisulfr_V> @PatStaresAt Remember, don't roll in the swamp.
[6:06:27] <$realm_forge> Wait…is the rot a living sentient  being?
[6:06:31] <Meekest> Maybe she's born with it
[6:06:37] <rosabellamelantha> WEDDING RING
[6:06:37] <SubjectX07x> You have to go to the right to that platform, step on a pressure plate and it will raise walkways to take.
[6:06:37] <%Valdorick> You're a faith build, so you can at least just set yourself on fire to get rid of the rot.
[6:06:40] <%SveriSageAdvice> it is a key item
[6:06:43] <%greasypete00> huh?
[6:06:44] <luciluxlu0> it's kinda mandatory a little

[6:06:52] <%discoinfierno> Is the rot something specific or just literally what happens when people spill enough blood on the ground
[6:06:52] <$Stari> You have to go through that area to continue Ranni’s quest
[6:06:53] <oda_flobunaga> @PatStaresAt That ring opens a door past the Lake of Rot

[6:08:20] <oda_flobunaga> @PatStaresAt the Ring opens a door past the lake of rot
[6:08:21] <binku_muja_> the person being drooled over by satan will be terribly put out by this.
[6:08:23] <vVAstrAVv> now put a ring on it
[6:08:31] <Wakerz140> Er, not the academy the thing you got the upside down statue for
[6:08:33] <$Stari> You have to get through the lake for Ranni

[6:08:38] <Sigma_190_Beta> @PatStaresAt Congrats on becoming the King Consort.
[6:08:43] <+Nomenanza> divine tower of liurnia -> lake of rot
[6:08:45] <+Funky_Honkey> Downstairs
[6:08:56] <nip_nips> lake of rot wasnt as bad as i expected
[6:08:58] <%Kevlar_Caviar> do you guys think he's strong enough to give mohg another try?
[6:09:00] <Meekest> Its pretty bad but it never gets easier
[6:09:00] <Wakerz140> You need to be real prepared for the lake
[6:09:01] <+Nomenanza> you can heal through the lake easily
[6:09:02] <+SpiritRoads> quickstep is a friend in the lake of rot
[6:09:02] <%dekkitout> It's doable
[6:09:03] <sirrice77> Its not too much you can do the lake i believe
[6:09:04] <rosabellamelantha> @PatStaresAt nah the lake of rot is like a level 80ish area? which you are
[6:09:04] <Wakerz140> but it's doable
[6:09:04] <%BlueLunecy> Just make some boules and pray
[6:09:05] <+livi242> I just did death runs through it
[6:09:07] <%AyotoCorp> You've got potions for that
[6:09:08] <@QueequegTheater> You can just run through it
[6:09:10] <%JoshManVGH> Where you ever able to go into the third tower?
[6:09:13] <%SveriSageAdvice> Lake of Rot is definitely doable right now
[6:09:14] <%Valdorick> Flame; Cleanse Me makes the rot lake not that hard
[6:09:14] <%TurtlesAndTentacles> nah you're big strong
[6:09:15] <digaogrunge> is this... too much?
[6:09:15] <luciluxlu0> nah, lake is lake
[6:09:16] <%Nobrev> is it a lake lake or can you torrent across it
[6:09:19] <%JustTheGuyYouNeed> its pretty bad but also doable
[6:09:25] <$0ddeye> lake of rot is easy
[6:09:29] <+extantCadence> Having high immunity helps a lot
[6:09:30] <Augus7717> the lake of rot counts as a mid level area @PatStaresAt LUL
[6:09:30] <sirrice77> @Nobrev nah you gotta walk
[6:09:31] <jubejube56> You’ve got a max level mimic and a godslaying blade
[6:09:35] <%AyotoCorp> You have to walk, but it doesn't slow your movement
[6:09:35] <luciluxlu0> it doesn't happen yet
[6:09:36] <jubejube56> How buff can you get?
[6:09:36] <+LandOfTheWay> @PatStaresAt i know there's another line of dialogue with ranni at the grace in her rise, but i don't know what triggers it
[6:09:38] <+Fenrisulfr_V> Ranni's quest isn't over yet.
[6:09:38] <SubjectX07x> Won't change until after Ranni's quest completes.
[6:09:39] <%MaybeFalco> you have to beat the zone boss down there first,
[6:09:40] <$0ddeye> more interesting for story reasons then it is difficult
[6:09:40] <+678saintglock> lake of rot is fucked but you can get through it
[6:09:42] <vVAstrAVv> its only bad if you fight a thing
[6:09:47] <$sarah_galb> just have plenty of immunity
[6:09:53] <%Valdorick> Either do Lake of Rot, or the Study hall, yeye
[6:09:53] <ExpressNode> Oh wow your still going? I just watched Odd Taxi in one go.  Suprised at how great it was.
[6:09:53] <+Edrem> @LandOfTheWay that's after her whole story is completed
[6:09:55] <%Kevlar_Caviar> not a bad idea
[6:09:56] <@QueequegTheater> @PatStaresAt Have you unlocked the chest yet
[6:09:57] <TheBlankAce> Check on Selivus when you get a chance
[6:09:58] <oda_flobunaga> @PatStaresAt the Lake is not too bad if you consign yourself to loosing your runes in it
[6:10:00] <%Brassnarwhal> do the holy mountain instead, if you get much stronger nothing in that area is gonna be any sort of issue
[6:10:00] <penitentpendant> One of my favorite bits, so much nostalgia
[6:10:06] <%SveriSageAdvice> i can check
[6:10:07] <rosabellamelantha> @PatStaresAt the lake of rot is fucked regardless of level but mostly because it's a poison swamp
[6:10:07] <%Valdorick> I think it does
[6:10:11] <+Funky_Honkey> ok, don't know why he didn't show up
[6:10:12] <+LandOfTheWay> @Edrem ah, so that'll be after dealing with blaidd
[6:10:14] <Midnight188> @QueequegTheater yes he did he has the ring
[6:10:16] <penitentpendant> Use the statue on the plinth before the globew
[6:10:17] <%JustTheGuyYouNeed> I think Radham armor has super high resistence
[6:10:22] <penitentpendant> Oh, you did already
[6:10:23] <%MaybeFalco> you have an immunity ring, and there's a +1 in the rot area
[6:10:24] <penitentpendant> Huzzah
[6:10:25] <+AyupaPupa> ceiling souls
[6:10:27] <+Kyma1020> If you have enough runes you can buy Radahn's armor at the finger lady at roundtable
[6:10:29] <rosabellamelantha> HE'S BACK
[6:10:29] <SubjectX07x> @PatStaresAt The lake of rot is more a puzzle than just slog through that whole lake, that thing to the right has a pressure plate which raises up a section of pathway for you to follow.
[6:10:31] <%SveriSageAdvice> @PatStaresAt it does indeed have high immunity
[6:10:31] <+sssoapy> catch these hands
[6:10:33] <+BeatBoxersDevMike> he's back!
[6:10:33] <+Fenrisulfr_V> Holy fuck, Blaidd's armor has a Frozen reference.
[6:10:36] <%JustTheGuyYouNeed> SHE IS BACK

[6:13:07] <%cascadepersona> I really should buy Death Stranding sometime, thanks for reminding me
[6:13:09] <sirrice77> Yeah you're way too strong for the plateau and volcano manor area now lol
[6:13:12] <SubjectX07x> Pat DID HIS TIME, and HE WANTS OUT
[6:13:14] <tanarath> He did just fall up
[6:13:16] <rosabellamelantha> @PatStaresAt that dude is lying late game areas are like level 150, you're mostly just overlevelling mid game
[6:13:19] <%greasypete00> after you beat her this time look behind you in the doorway @PatStaresAt
[6:13:19] <%JustTheGuyYouNeed> Whoever said that is super wrong, the second half is no fucking joke
[6:13:20] <+BeatBoxersDevMike> the radahn fight is such a mess
[6:13:20] <%SpontaneousC> has it been confirmed yet that the bosses dont have stamina or is that just people being crazy?
[6:13:26] <%Puhff> imagine playing s these games for the challenge
[6:13:28] <%strakillias> Being OP in souls rules tho. Beating the piss out of bosses is way more fun than hard fights
[6:13:34] <DestroPrime83> oh cool this whole tower is upside down
[6:13:37] <%Brassnarwhal> i said that, it's up to you i meant it as a suggestion I'm just here for the ride
[6:13:38] <vVAstrAVv> when there is a challenge hell just spam lightening let him pork up at this point

[6:13:44] <SubjectX07x> The bosses don't really have stamina but they absolutely have poise.
[6:13:46] <rommlll> why is it every time i come back to the stream i see pat cheesing
[6:13:47] <TheBlankAce> Its probably better to do this anyway just so you're not exploring a new zone and going back and forth between these areas and that
[6:13:48] <%Valdorick> I can't believe Pat isn't doing a soul level 1 naked punch run
[6:13:54] <%TurtlesAndTentacles> The game didnt allow shit. You worked hard for it
[6:14:03] <DanThePumpkinman> wow i fuckin hate thise hand things
[6:14:04] <ohno58> They really wanted those to be spiders
[6:14:07] <%Brassnarwhal> i love just watching you play pat but i want to see some sick ass incants from the mountain

[6:21:08] <%soloshotfirst82> For a fat guy, Tons o' Fun has some quickness to him.
[6:21:10] <rommlll> he puts some stank in that stab

[6:26:44] <%Dakuu75> *confusion intensifies*
[6:26:44] <+redjack108> You know, the only way I can describe this game is that it plays the way you imagine The Silmarillion in your head when you read it.

[6:29:25] <%greasypete00> they somehow made them look worse
[6:29:26] <+Fenrisulfr_V> @PatStaresAt Remember, the shrimp men worship Scarlet Rot.

[6:31:02] <+BeatBoxersDevMike> the armor related to those guys has a bit of solid immunity stat
[6:31:04] <SubjectX07x> Ohhh, yeah no, I didn't even get to fight Fia's boss because I kiiinda killed her before doing it because I was scared I'd lock into her ending lmao.
[6:31:05] <%dekkitout> Why's a druid here?
[6:31:08] <%greasypete00> hes a bit lost i think
[6:31:25] <+LandOfTheWay> @PatStaresAt just as a heads up, fia is in the Deeproot Depths, the location you got to via the coffin after the gargoyles
[6:31:25] <+tizziks> ah hah!  that's why he was just wlaking.
[6:31:29] <+tizziks> That's clever
[6:31:33] <%Puhff> wait wtf
[6:31:34] <Sigma_190_Beta> @PatStaresAt There's another pillar.
[6:31:36] <+Kyma1020> I can't look at strawberry smoothies the same anymore
[6:31:37] <%Puhff> why he down there
[6:31:40] <sirrice77> @SubjectX07x its cool you get two neat faith spells that have 47 for the req i think
[6:31:42] <%Puhff> HOW he down there?!?!?!
[6:31:44] <rommlll> man
[6:31:47] <%sniffy77> immunizing horn charm wat that
[6:31:47] <%TurtlesAndTentacles> the item gives immunity?
[6:31:52] <+Fenrisulfr_V> What a nightmare realm.
[6:31:57] <SubjectX07x> Hmm, guess I'll do her ending in NG+ then.
[6:32:07] <haisho> that's a big bar
[6:32:19] <%MaybeFalco> you could also wear gear that increases immunity as well, it helps out a lot in this section
[6:32:26] <+Nomenanza> do you need info on where the next grace is or you fine exploring?
[6:32:27] <%Valdorick> Yeah, it looks worse than it is
[6:32:28] <%greasypete00> do you know if the radahn rune would help here at all
[6:32:28] <%TurtlesAndTentacles> we told you
[6:32:34] <rudiciuscaesar> awww sick timing
[6:32:35] <rommlll> bahaha
[6:32:36] <SubjectX07x> Tbh you having that spell to purge the rot makes it far less awful.
[6:32:48] <rommlll> it could be ds1 toxic
[6:32:50] <%MaybeFalco> it could be blight town
[6:32:50] <%Valdorick> There could be an ambush with 3 bas- oh yeah, that
[6:32:55] <+Fenrisulfr_V> OH, the horn people lived here BEFORE the Scarlet Rot moved in.
[6:32:56] <ohno58> Just then
[6:33:00] <%Nobrev> goddamn basilisks
[6:33:00] <rudiciuscaesar> this is just Status Effect Zone
[6:33:01] <%Puhff> it gets worse
[6:33:05] <iteruq> worsenning
[6:33:13] <SubjectX07x> @Fenrisulfr_V Oof, that's rough.
[6:33:19] <+Nomenanza> basiliscs are harmless really. Unlike ones in DS2 they dont have bullshit melee attacks
[6:33:21] <%Monkeyweed21> at least there's no frenzy tower right
[6:33:41] <%Valdorick> Yeah, this could be a madness swamp
[6:33:48] <tolloponik> @Monkeyweed21 that was 3 streams ago
[6:33:48] <AthenaAegis> The googly eyes are back Kappa
[6:33:50] <rosabellamelantha> the charm helps a LOT
[6:33:51] <oda_flobunaga> @Monkeyweed21 that's another location
[6:33:54] <$sarah_galb> boss
[6:33:55] <%TurtlesAndTentacles> Rot ussy
[6:33:55] <luciluxlu0> yes
[6:33:55] <VidulaSaix> Yep
[6:33:55] <rudiciuscaesar> this area would be a nightmare for red-green color blind people...
[6:33:55] <%shootbang_exe> yeah
[6:33:56] <rosabellamelantha> its a boss
[6:33:57] <ohno58> boss
[6:33:57] <Wakerz140> It's a big fight
[6:33:58] <SubjectX07x> Dead thing I believe.
[6:34:00] <rommlll> find out
[6:34:00] <oda_flobunaga> ignore it
[6:34:00] <%shootbang_exe> no it's a fight
[6:34:01] <Sigma_190_Beta> I think that's a boos fight.
[6:34:03] <grimwire1> im guessing boss
[6:34:03] <+Kyma1020> boss
[6:34:05] <%BlueLunecy> Go throw a rock and see
[6:34:06] <tanarath> Is it a boss fight?
[6:34:06] <ohno58> He drops a nice katana
[6:34:07] <%Monkeyweed21> @oda_flobunaga I know i've been there
[6:34:09] <%TheGuesty> You will fight a lady starting with the letter M
[6:34:09] <luciluxlu0> optional though
[6:34:11] <VidulaSaix> I SUPER ignored it LUL
[6:34:11] <rosabellamelantha> Mimic can be summoned
[6:34:13] <sirrice77> boss yeah, but he's no lightning powers
[6:34:15] <+BeatBoxersDevMike> time for greg
[6:34:16] <jaygee303> Yes
[6:34:16] <jell_ree> its a tree trunk
[6:34:17] <+tavian99> Do it
[6:34:20] <luciluxlu0> lol
[6:34:28] <rommlll> you choose to play elden ring
[6:34:28] <tolloponik> is that a dragon ass
[6:34:29] <digaogrunge> GET GREG
[6:34:30] <%Valdorick> Dragonforeskin Soldier
[6:34:31] <SubjectX07x> Are you fucking kidding me!?
[6:34:36] <SubjectX07x> They actually put a dragon kin in here!?
[6:34:37] <+Fenrisulfr_V> Pretty sure Greg's immune to Scarlet Rot, so this is a great place for him.
[6:34:37] <%cascadepersona> Friend
[6:34:41] <$thomassolorio> unit 01
[6:34:42] <Grave_Titan_D> is this the "poison swamp" miyazaki had a new love of making?
[6:34:42] <rommlll> nice fupa
[6:34:46] <%notsoy> wASTED
[6:34:46] <%Pyon84> Oh he's not bad
[6:34:54] <%TurtlesAndTentacles> wait
[6:34:54] <RyuuAoi> ,well
[6:34:55] <tri3dgE027> terrible place to have this fight rooD
[6:34:55] <+Nomenanza> something tells me he finna be a rot boy
[6:34:58] <%dekkitout> psaWhat
[6:34:59] <tanarath> big rotty eva, nice
[6:35:00] <%californaya> I'm not sure what I expected dot jpg
[6:35:03] <SubjectX07x> Welp.. guess I get to go back there now..
[6:35:07] <rosabellamelantha> He's really not bad he's just in a shit location
[6:35:08] <+Fenrisulfr_V> @Grave_Titan_D It's one of the, I think, FIVE in the game.
[6:35:10] <+redjack108> @Grave_Titan_D One of the many poison swamps.
[6:35:15] <%Valdorick> Yep, I didn't find that fucko
[6:35:16] <%TurtlesAndTentacles> every being that is that tall are missing organs? I'd love to know the lore behind that
[6:35:18] <sirrice77> miyazaki's last request would probably to be buried in a swamp
[6:35:20] <luciluxlu0> @grave_titan_d honestly I have no clue. there is so many blight towns
[6:35:32] <rosabellamelantha> @PatStaresAt I reccomend getting the next grace first as it's less rot to traverse on your way back to the boss
[6:35:42] <%Valdorick> CLOSE
[6:35:45] <rommlll> CLUTCH
[6:35:46] <+Nomenanza> oof close
[6:35:49] <+BeatBoxersDevMike> "wont you take me far away from the muckymuck now?"
[6:35:53] <+redjack108> HP edging.
[6:35:54] <+tavian99> Close
[6:35:58] <bassoontyphoon> Guys this isn’t a poison swamp. This is a rotting lake, there is a clear distinction
[6:36:07] <%Dakuu75> I think I watched Veldryn do this area
[6:36:27] <rommlll> I just love swamps
[6:36:28] <%dekkitout> This is the dark souls of poison swamps
[6:36:31] <+Nomenanza> most of the poison swamps are ignored via Torrent
[6:36:32] <Sigma_190_Beta> Honestly, yeah.
[6:36:35] <oda_flobunaga> Plus, there are some really excellent Poison zones later
[6:36:35] <%Valdorick> The fact that there's no Torrent eating swamp yet is good.
[6:36:37] <+Nomenanza> this is one of the few that you have to go on foot
[6:36:40] <%BonewheelVanguard> just imagen if this place had a movement penalty
[6:36:41] <NBUsagi> just an environment that actively hates you
[6:36:44] <%greasypete00> theyre much less obnoxious and i actually found aeonia kinda fun to traverse with torrecnt
[6:36:48] <+Fenrisulfr_V> For sure.
[6:36:51] <%Monkeyweed21> Is this Miyazaki's George Lucas moment of "I may have gone too far in a number of places
[6:36:54] <%luftraumm1> it looks soooo wrong
[6:36:55] <%cascadepersona> Seems better than Demon Souls' awful, awful poison swamp
[6:37:01] <%Valdorick> "and for my final trick, the Swamp of Sorrow from Never Ending Story, here to kill Torrent forever"
[6:37:04] <DefaultSettiings> whats with the lake of strawberry jelly danidaBoba
[6:37:04] <jaygee303> Wait till the ass eating swamp
[6:37:09] <vVAstrAVv> i mean riding torrent makes ypu immune to most of them anyways
[6:37:11] <RubberFistFight> scarlet rot is just "all new all different Toxic"
[6:37:12] <+Fenrisulfr_V> They're also all beautiful, in a way.
[6:37:14] <rommlll> i like the red color
[6:37:15] <%Dakuu75> ye
[6:37:22] <vVAstrAVv> this ones the only REAL one
[6:37:22] <haisho> looks like an EVA ending
[6:37:26] <oda_flobunaga> @PatStaresAt this almost feels like an apology for Izalith
[6:37:27] <%luftraumm1> not fighting the foreskin dragon?
[6:37:27] <LuckyTerry> The music tops it off!
[6:37:30] <rommlll> true
[6:37:31] <tanarath> This LITERALLY IS the end of the world
[6:37:32] <+SinisterBroccoli> at least you can fucking run in this
[6:37:36] <%cascadepersona> I do like EVA
[6:37:36] <Parapattern> It's worse from a story perspective but not from a gameplay perspective
[6:37:37] <%MaybeFalco> oh
[6:37:38] <+Nomenanza> the undeground shit in this game reminds me of Subnautica weirdly enough
[6:37:38] <fishmonger555> if i accept rot into my life, will i become a bug man?
[6:37:41] <rommlll> welp
[6:37:42] <$realm_forge> this looks like the end of evangelion
[6:37:42] <DestroPrime83> Why does robot arm lady love this shit so much?
[6:37:44] <+Nomenanza> same horrid vibe
[6:37:58] <%strakillias> Kinda reminds me of the fetus zone in DeS but done on a grander scale
[6:37:59] <%Valdorick> its a fuck'n elf
[6:37:59] <%Brassnarwhal> @destroprime83 nurgle
[6:38:00] <%greasypete00> something about the rot being a brighter pink/red makes it wrose than browny-green
[6:38:01] <Grave_Titan_D> the music does a really good job of setting the tone
[6:38:03] <+LandOfTheWay> @destroprime83 she hates it, actually
[6:38:05] <%discoinfierno> @Nomenanza the music is extremely similar
[6:38:07] <rommlll> this music
[6:38:09] <NBUsagi> giant elf?
[6:38:11] <$SGrim> @fishmonger555 No, but your penis will fall off.
[6:38:11] <+BeatBoxersDevMike> smack em up
[6:38:11] <%dekkitout> Who's this Nosferatu?
[6:38:15] <+SinisterBroccoli> seems like lightning spear has fallen off a bit in potency
[6:38:20] <DestroPrime83> I dont know the lore
[6:38:22] <timbob> who is this dark elf lookin motherfucker
[6:38:23] <rommlll> get overr heree
[6:38:24] <+GingerStrawhat> That is just straight up a Dark Elf, George
[6:38:26] <+Nomenanza> @discoinfierno yeah
[6:38:28] <+Fenrisulfr_V> I'm still waiting for the day when one of those Alabaster Lords steps out in a full outfit.

[6:40:19] <%Valdorick> L-lewd
[6:40:26] <%JoshManVGH> Centipedes

[6:40:29] <%greasypete00> old ones time
[6:40:29] <Guardiansaiyan> DON'T KINK SHAME
[6:40:30] <+tizziks> Looks like a germating seed
[6:40:36] <%dekkitout> Alright, I'll bite. Is this the real Bloodborne 2?
[6:40:37] <EynoStiles> probably a ur tree seed
[6:40:38] <%cascadepersona> Bloodborne-esque
[6:40:39] <%Brassnarwhal> @joshmanvgh i think they are all seperate but connected
[6:40:42] <+Fenrisulfr_V> @Parapattern Roots are tree tentacles.
[6:40:44] <tanarath> MIDNIGHT RITUAL
[6:40:45] <penitentpendant> @JoshManVGH How deep do the Erdtree's roots go?
[6:40:47] <+BeatBoxersDevMike> rot beetle
[6:40:48] <rommlll> is stream ending?

[6:41:19] <animeshaquilleoneil> forbidden kool aid
[6:41:32] <%dekkitout> You can tell me Yharnam is on the other side of the planet and I'd believe you
[6:41:32] <RubberFistFight> Don't you got any of them stabilising boluses?
[6:41:35] <penitentpendant> Is the HP regen spell worth anything here?
[6:41:41] <%Dakuu75> I'm gonna have to remember to stack a bunch of regen for this place
[6:41:44] <RubberFistFight> sorry, Preserving Boluses
[6:41:48] <%Valdorick> It is, infact
[6:41:54] <LuckyTerry> what level is Pat?

[6:44:14] <djblue_shift> that was my first thought yah
[6:44:15] <SubjectX07x> @dekkitout I play with my early level friends using end game weapons, because I'm an ass lmao.
[6:44:20] <rudiciuscaesar> would the wearer receive any buff if they were poisoned or rotted?
[6:44:26] <digaogrunge> Looks like a piece of shit
[6:44:27] <rudiciuscaesar> it specifically said something else, right?
[6:44:29] <Hunk_Of_Dunk> Oh jesus what the fuck is this zone

[6:44:53] <+Tredecian> @can you stack it
[6:45:01] <RubberFistFight> @Hunk_Of_Dunk Lake of Rot. It's basically an entire zone's worth of the Scarlet Rot debuff which is this game's Toxic
[6:45:02] <+Edrem> throwing dung bombs in pvp gonna be good fun with that
[6:45:09] <kinkade_77> do we know the damage buff

[6:46:17] <rommlll> all this scarlet rot makes me want to pee
[6:46:18] <Happydisaster> Twice
[6:46:18] <+BeatBoxersDevMike> funfact, scarlet rot tastes like strawberry jam
[6:46:21] <+Nomenanza> right in front
[6:46:25] <%X2Eliah> wait... is this area actually empty or did pat just kill everythiong already? (I just woke up)
[6:46:36] <Samuraiflame> is THIS izalith
[6:46:39] <%TurtlesAndTentacles> There are like 4 Hells in this game
[6:46:39] <%Valdorick> Going down NEVER STOPS
[6:46:40] <%notsoy> it's empty
[6:46:41] <+BeatBoxersDevMike> DEEPER
[6:46:41] <%luftraumm1> what the HELL??
[6:46:44] <RubberFistFight> It's rot all the way down
[6:46:45] <NBUsagi> praise the rot
[6:46:46] <rudiciuscaesar> Journey to the Center of the Earth
[6:46:46] <%dekkitout> Meaning it predates the rot?
[6:46:48] <%Brassnarwhal> @beatboxersdevmike with just a hint of anthrax
[6:46:50] <RyuuAoi> Go pee, Pat
[6:46:50] <%discoinfierno> neoliberal temple lmao
[6:46:53] <%notsoy> swamp izalith jesus fuck
[6:46:56] <+Fenrisulfr_V> @X2Eliah He just got to the part where most of the enemies are.
[6:46:59] <%cascadepersona> Welcome to hell
[6:47:06] <Hunk_Of_Dunk> do we even know where the rot COMES FROM yet?
[6:47:06] <jorniev> SO THE BLOOD SWAM IS JUST CALLED THE ROT !?
[6:47:18] <%Brassnarwhal> it's double hell
[6:47:18] <tanarath> psaElmo psaElmo NomNom
[6:47:21] <dashmatt> temple of doom type shit
[6:47:23] <%X2Eliah> Ah. So that part he was running around actually was empty? jeez. That somehow seems so wrong
[6:47:25] <%dekkitout> So there's some really fucked shit round the corner from this place
[6:47:31] <%Brassnarwhal> @jorniev it causes rot not bleed so yes
[6:47:32] <dan_g_v> feed the pee?  I think Pat is a bit tired
[6:47:39] <bassoontyphoon> So we’re exploring the site of Margaret thatchers grave? Is that why everything is horrifically rotting?
[6:47:40] <+Fenrisulfr_V> @Hunk_Of_Dunk There's a potential that the Erdtree itself created it, but I haven't read enough up on the lore yet.
[6:47:52] <%Brassnarwhal> @jorniev lore wise the red is almost certainly a red fungal bloom
[6:48:06] <+BeatBoxersDevMike> i have a question for anyone who's played far enough, do you know how to get to the VERY bottom of crumbling farum azula?
[6:48:15] <jorniev> im just gonna leave i dont want to spoil this game for me
[6:48:20] <jorniev> anymore
[6:48:31] <%Brassnarwhal> @jorniev good luck enjoy er
[6:48:45] <%cade_calrayn> Howdy, y'all, just back from the Batman. Whereabouts is Pat now
[6:49:00] <%cade_calrayn> In the game I mean lol
[6:49:00] <%X2Eliah> @cade_calrayn toilet
[6:49:09] <%Brassnarwhal> geif is squeezing pat while he lets the cat out
[6:49:15] <%X2Eliah> ... proverbial toilet?
[6:49:17] <%soloshotfirst82> @cade_calrayn Lake of Rot
[6:49:19] <%MaybeFalco> @cade_calrayn he just made it to the grace in the rot temple
[6:49:31] <+redjack108> I mean, symbolically speaking, IRL fungi do parasitize trees, particularly ones that have already been damaged or have dead parts. So maybe SR is something like that, but since the Erdtree is so essential to the world, it's a spiritual rot in addition to a physical one. We even see it infecting one of the minor Erdtrees.
[6:49:32] <djblue_shift> how was patty batty
[6:49:32] <LuckyTerry> Rot level
[6:49:33] <FoolproofDread> @x2eliah let's hope he can climb back out 🙏 🙏 🙏
[6:49:34] <%cade_calrayn> Uhh.... I don't know where that is
[6:49:40] <%cade_calrayn> How'd he get there?
[6:49:59] <Hunk_Of_Dunk> He went down, then he went down again?
[6:50:13] <%Brassnarwhal> @cade_calrayn underground i think it connected from nokron or some shit
[6:50:15] <%MaybeFalco> ainsel river main, through the ranni questline
[6:50:25] <%Brassnarwhal> i wasnt paying attention at the time
[6:51:01] <+Fenrisulfr_V> @cade_calrayn Teleporter in Renna's tower, which opened after Pat progressed Ranni's quest.
[6:51:07] <%Brassnarwhal> @maybefalco oh he got teleported huh
[6:51:10] <%cade_calrayn> Ahhhh
[6:51:12] <%cade_calrayn> Gracias
[6:51:22] <rommlll> whos renna, is she ranni?
[6:51:25] <SuperInhuman> I like the eva spear greatsword. I wish pat could YEET it
[6:51:49] <%cade_calrayn> Renna = Rennala
[6:51:51] <%greasypete00> did he get the frozen lightning spear yet
[6:51:52] <%cade_calrayn> i assume
[6:51:57] <%Brassnarwhal> @superinhuman theres a javelin throw wa but you cant swap the unique art out
[6:52:01] <+Fenrisulfr_V> @rommlll Sort of? The chick that gives you the Spirit Bell calls herself Renna, but is actually Ranni. I don't think we actually know who the real Renna is.
[6:52:12] <SuperInhuman> sad
[6:52:17] <%cade_calrayn> @Fenrisulfr_V it's Rennala, Ranni's mother
[6:52:42] <SuperInhuman> ngl some of elden ring reminds me of brutal legends
[6:52:44] <%X2Eliah> But rennala is sitting at the academy with her egg
[6:52:50] <+Fenrisulfr_V> Weird. I wonder where the -la came from. Maybe it's a royalty suffix?
[6:53:11] <%Brassnarwhal> @x2eliah yeah but you also killed her sorta so it's complicated
[6:53:12] <%cade_calrayn> More likely that Renna is a nickname
[6:53:19] <+Fenrisulfr_V> That also means that Ranni is half-siblings with most of Marika's children.
[6:53:22] <sirrice77> she is in the academy but three sisters is next the carian manor which is for carian royalty which she is
[6:53:31] <rommlll> so many babes
[6:53:42] <+Fenrisulfr_V> Ah, I must've missed that lore blurb.
[6:53:43] <%cade_calrayn> and considering that Rennala is the Queen of Caria, it makes sense for her to have a tower named after her
[6:54:01] <+Fenrisulfr_V> It may have been her tower when she was still a princess.
[6:54:15] <%Brassnarwhal> @x2eliah and dont even start on why there are 2 of the sorceror trainer ladies, they both exist concurrently one chained and one selling sorceries and chatting
[6:54:17] <%X2Eliah> that makes sense
[6:54:23] <+Tyk1337> How is the lore shaping up compared to Dark Souls and Bloodborne generally? Is it as cool?
[6:54:33] <%cade_calrayn> Yeah that's why the mages locked her in the library, when she went crazy they realized they could seize power
[6:54:38] <+Fenrisulfr_V> It's much clearer. I really like it, personally.
[6:54:45] <%cade_calrayn> @Brassnarwhal I believe the one in Waypoint is her astral projection, a phantom
[6:54:50] <%X2Eliah> Well, it has less guns and less blood orgasming, so maybe not as "cool"
[6:54:54] <SuperInhuman> So the elden ring is actually a reference to hands across America and that's why you fight a clone of you
[6:55:01] <+Fenrisulfr_V> It's also interesting because, unlike the other Souls games, you're currently playing DURING the apocalypse, not afterwards.
[6:55:10] <%Brassnarwhal> @cade_calrayn weird
[6:55:11] <SuperInhuman> didn't la
[6:55:21] <SuperInhuman> didn't kayne have a quote about power
[6:55:38] <djblue_shift> @SuperInhuman oh no, is the backstory just copy pasted from Us
[6:55:43] <+Fenrisulfr_V> Kanye talks a lot, so maybe.
[6:55:44] <%X2Eliah> Kanye also had a quote for his shoes
[6:55:51] <%cade_calrayn> She's imprisoned but still has enough power to manifest herself elsewhere
[6:55:54] <%MartinOfLoxley> Kanye has multiple quotes about power
[6:56:03] <%Kevlar_Caviar> @Tyk1337 it's VERY cool, i've literally been reading/writing about it all day
[6:56:03] <SuperInhuman> kanye bad mean shoes
[6:56:06] <%Brassnarwhal> @fenrisulfr_v it's the age of gods and dragons game that some people wanted but with a different name on the box
[6:56:08] <+alphonseisbest> DOES anyone KNOW yet why the're two magic ladies?
[6:56:10] <+polothegreatest> plagueTaps plagueTaps plagueTaps plagueTaps
[6:56:14] <%notsoy> GIEF STARES AT
[6:56:14] <SuperInhuman> kanye has mean shoes
[6:56:14] <%strakillias> Finally the real streamer is here
[6:56:15] <%MaybeFalco> gief about to beat elden ring
[6:56:16] <Ner234> Gief stream now
[6:56:16] <bassoontyphoon> !uptime
[6:56:16] <%dekkitout> Gief's got this half of the game for sure
[6:56:16] <@Moobot> @bassoontyphoon I've been playing this game for how long? Oh only 6h 56m.
[6:56:18] <%Brassnarwhal> psaGiefrail psaMenace psaMenace psaMenace
[6:56:20] <%MartinOfLoxley> That's Gief's butt pillow now
[6:56:20] <+tavian99> He wants to play the game
[6:56:21] <+Fenrisulfr_V> @Brassnarwhal Yeah, for sure.
[6:56:31] <sirrice77> @alphonseisbest yes
[6:56:41] <%YakumoYomi> Why does it say "fap" in the bottom left?
[6:56:42] <+Fenrisulfr_V> @PatStaresAt Are you losing weight?
[6:56:55] <sirrice77> @alphonseisbest to find out you have to do her questline, i would tell you but thats spoilers
[6:56:59] <+ScrapKingKeita> So, one of my mutuals just got the platinum trophy for this game...
[6:57:04] <%whyskeywolfe> Just give all your food to Zangief
[6:57:07] <%Brassnarwhal> @fenrisulfr_v they even combined ptromancy into faith which isnt exactly the same but in ds puromancy split off from sorcery
[6:57:12] <+alphonseisbest> @alphonseisbest ty its been driving me mad
[6:57:13] <RyuuAoi> No, Pat! What about the orb?!
[6:57:13] <%Kevlar_Caviar> @ScrapKingKeita goddamn
[6:57:26] <+Tyk1337> How is the lore better than other Souls games generally? Like just because there's more of it in-game and less to be obtained from subtext and item descriptions?
[6:57:27] <%dekkitout> Feels less
[6:57:33] <penitentpendant> It's a shame this area isn't big enough for Torrent
[6:57:41] <RyuuAoi> Who ever said that, ya momma a ho
[6:57:45] <+Fenrisulfr_V> @Brassnarwhal imo, that's still one of my favorite changes. I'm so happy that Faith got more offensive spells.
[6:57:48] <+hakumaribo> cant you ride torrent?
[6:57:59] <%Valdorick> I'm... going to assume he's immune to Rot
[6:58:02] <%Brassnarwhal> @tyk1337 theres more un game not less in subtext tho
[6:58:04] <%notsoy> nope
[6:58:13] <%Kevlar_Caviar> @Tyk1337 there's more of the primary story that's explained naturally, but to balance things there's a LOT more background lore to look into
[6:58:19] <%luftraumm1> how in the seven hells are you gonna clear this bastard
[6:58:21] <%dekkitout> Alright, noted
[6:58:22] <+Fenrisulfr_V> @Valdorick Greg's a ghost, therefore immune to rot and poison.
[6:58:22] <rudiciuscaesar> oh shit, the dragon magic breath
[6:58:30] <RubberFistFight> holy shit this asshole AGAIN?
[6:58:35] <%Valdorick> @Valdorick I meant the boss
[6:58:38] <RubberFistFight> this is like the third fucking time you have to fight this fucker
[6:58:50] <%TurtlesAndTentacles> firgues
[6:58:57] <RubberFistFight> elden ring doesn't have "lots of bosses", it has a few bosses copy-pasted all over the map.
[6:59:01] <rudiciuscaesar> yeah, that did good damage
[6:59:03] <$Smokay17> Worth a shot tho
[6:59:03] <RubberFistFight> that's just disappointing.
[6:59:06] <RyuuAoi> Maybe weak to fire?
[6:59:07] <%Brassnarwhal> rotted away
[6:59:07] <tolloponik> but can he be poisened?
[6:59:09] <rudiciuscaesar> Godzilla mouth blast
[6:59:20] <%greasypete00> this guy was sleeping in the rot, drinking it, moisturizing with it, and pat still goes "i can rot him tho"
[6:59:21] <RubberFistFight> @PatStaresAt dude that's no joke the third encounter with that boss.,
[6:59:25] <sirrice77> @alphonseisbest if you want a hint on how to start her questline theres a npc to "talk" to near hermits village in the volcano area, you get a spell. talk to spell lady then
[6:59:28] <%Kevlar_Caviar> nah, even with the copy-pasted bosses there's still a lot of unique bosses
[6:59:34] <RubberFistFight> there's also like 3 or 4 of the crystal bull bosses
[6:59:34] <%SaiyanShoto> Nah there’s a lot of bosses in this game
[6:59:35] <%Monkeyweed21> theres like 80 unique bosses
[6:59:36] <%Valdorick> Even with copied bosses, it has more bosses than the entire Dark Souls trilogy
[6:59:36] <RubberFistFight> 4 or 5 dragons
[6:59:38] <Sigma_190_Beta> @RubberFistFight There's 73 Unique bosses.
[6:59:38] <tolloponik> some bosses just become normal enemies later
[6:59:38] <+ArtemisCroc> for scale, this game has as many repeat bosses as any other dark souls game
[6:59:41] <+ScrapKingKeita> Even just in Limgrave, there are about as many bosses as there are in DS1
[6:59:47] <%Kevlar_Caviar> and even a lot of the copy-pasted ones have unique shit
[6:59:49] <SubjectX07x> Yes, there are a good few duplicate bosses in the game, but as pat said there are like 80 UNIQUE bosses.
[6:59:54] <Hunk_Of_Dunk> Even with the copy and pasted bosses there's still a fucking bajillion
[6:59:58] <%SaiyanShoto> I just fought some weird ass decaying bird, definitely haven’t run into that before in this game
[7:00:00] <SubjectX07x> Which is a fucking shit load of bosses.
[7:00:00] <+Prinny_Raider> Is that the lance of loginus?
[7:00:02] <+redjack108> I found a compilation of every boss fight in the game including the semi-copies and it was three hours long.
[7:00:06] <@Spydurman> there's like 80 bosses and 70 of them are totally unique probably. That's still pretty good
[7:00:12] <Zourath> Even with the "copy paste", the copies have enough variation to effectively be their own boss.
[7:00:12] <digaogrunge> 10 repeats in a game with 83 is ok
[7:00:12] <+livi242> I'd say the erdtree avatars are the worst offenders
[7:00:12] <sirrice77> well even the dupe bosses sometimes has added moves
[7:00:17] <rudiciuscaesar> @tolloponik I love when a boss becomes a normal enemy, I wish cleric beast would have done that, I was like "man, it totally will be a random enemy..." but never did.
[7:00:23] <DestroPrime83> Rubber is just buttmad he cant play this game Kappa
[7:00:24] <%Kevlar_Caviar> @Spydurman 80? nah there's over 100 lmao
[7:00:32] <%Monkeyweed21> a handful of repeated bosses doesnt really feel that bad in a game with like 100 boss fights
[7:00:39] <%dekkitout> A wins a win
[7:00:41] <RubberFistFight> what's funny is DS1 gets flack for having the asylum demon 3 times wearing different hats, but everyone's sucking this game off for basically the same thing.
[7:00:42] <%luftraumm1> mimic is rot free
[7:00:45] <rudiciuscaesar> dust this bitch
[7:00:55] <zenith0111> we take those!
[7:00:59] <@Spydurman> @Kevlar_Caviar probably hahaha but that kinda ratio, like 90% unique with some repeats
[7:01:00] <+tavian99> Cheese it
[7:01:02] <%notsoy> goddamn
[7:01:02] <+kekkerscrew> Get Smoked
[7:01:08] <+Fenrisulfr_V> The only repeat boss I have a problem with is the infested worm dragon that's always TOO FUCKING BIG for the arena it's in.
[7:01:12] <+ShazBo2000> Farewell Drovakin
[7:01:20] <rudiciuscaesar> that's ultra fair cuz you gotta get super rotted to fight his dumb ass
[7:01:22] <%Kevlar_Caviar> remember when before release we were all like "wow, this game might have like, 50 bosses!"
[7:01:24] <%Kevlar_Caviar> lmao
[7:01:24] <+Nomenanza> nah looks different
[7:01:28] <+Fenrisulfr_V> IT'S THE NETWORK TEST KATANA
[7:01:30] <+Nomenanza> from network it was ice lightning
[7:01:36] <+Nomenanza> oh nvm it is from network test
[7:01:44] <rudiciuscaesar> ice lightning....
[7:01:45] <kinkade_77> WHY ARE THERE NO FAITH KATANAS
[7:01:46] <DestroPrime83> @RubberFistFight wow dude just get off the stream if your gonna keep this hit up. nobody cares
[7:01:52] <Hunk_Of_Dunk> does ice lightning deal ice damage or lightning damage
[7:01:54] <%beavnation> whats it say?
[7:01:56] <NewWillinium> . . Did we ever find the Network test Red Wolfish armor?
[7:02:05] <stickandstonefruit> samurai are godless
[7:02:07] <+redjack108> Out here we make our own faith katanas.
[7:02:07] <ape_hawk> because theres no god in japan
[7:02:09] <%Monkeyweed21> hope for one in the DLC i guess
[7:02:10] <+ScrapKingKeita> Because Folded Steel > faith in god, or something
[7:02:11] <ohno58> There's one thats pretty good
[7:02:13] <%Kevlar_Caviar> @NewWillinium it's a late-game sidequest armor
[7:02:17] <%dekkitout> Faithless weebs
[7:02:17] <%TurtlesAndTentacles> because Samurai are int
[7:02:18] <+Rellim80> Does it bleed?
[7:02:19] <RubberFistFight> @DestroPrime83 how bout you suck my dick? I think the game's great but I'm not gonna pretend like rubber-stamp bosses don't get tiresome.
[7:02:20] <+Fenrisulfr_V> @NewWillinium I have personally, but it's not there for while yet on Pat's end.
[7:02:33] <$Stari> Follow the red river for Ranni
[7:02:34] <+Fenrisulfr_V> yikes
[7:02:37] <Happydisaster> Cause god abandoned all weebs
[7:02:41] <%Aeoneth> Pat this game is scaring me with the amount of content in it
[7:02:43] <digaogrunge> SPEND RUNES
[7:02:46] <jaygee303> @patstaresat you have 80k runes
[7:02:50] <+Fenrisulfr_V> There's copy-paste bosses in every Souls game, bruh.
[7:02:54] <jmft2000> Level up
[7:02:55] <%Valdorick> I mean, how many of the Copy Pasted bosses are the mandatory ones?
[7:02:56] <rudiciuscaesar> it's flowing too something, not from it?
[7:03:02] <%MartinOfLoxley> Spend Runes
[7:03:09] <%Monkeyweed21> Miyazaki predicted all the power of god and anime memes and protected us
[7:03:09] <Hunk_Of_Dunk> Oh wow, I just looked it up, there legitimately isn't any katana with natural faith scaling. Fucked up
[7:03:10] <%burgerbro34> I got a splinter
[7:03:13] <RubberFistFight> @Fenrisulfr_V yeah there are, and they all get called out for it too,.
[7:03:14] <NewWillinium> @NewWillinium Bloody hell really? After how long Pat
[7:03:14] <fishmonger555> Cloister is not a fun word :(
[7:03:16] <%Kevlar_Caviar> @Valdorick not many
[7:03:22] <%dekkitout> @Stari I hope that was intended, cause that is a euphemism
[7:03:24] <NewWillinium> @NewWillinium 's been plauing
[7:03:33] <sothatsprettybrutal> i feel like having those items 1-9 is... not better than having like 3-4 types you need various amounts of
[7:03:37] <$0ddeye> @RubberFistFight I hope you didn't enjoy Skyrim
[7:03:45] <%burgerbro34> love pats fungi hat
[7:03:46] <kinkade_77> whats cap
[7:03:48] <%X2Eliah> How few of the bosses do you actually need to beat in, let's  say the "typical not exploring just doing what youre told" playstyle?
[7:03:48] <+Fenrisulfr_V> @RubberFistFight I mean, I personally don't care as long as the repeats are fun to fight.
[7:03:50] <RubberFistFight> I haven't even played skyrim
[7:03:57] <%cade_calrayn> Wow so this place looks like it SUCKS
[7:03:59] <@Spydurman> alright guys, cool off on the boss fight arguing
[7:04:09] <RubberFistFight> @Fenrisulfr_V problem is they're not.
[7:04:15] <+BeatBoxersDevMike> these shrimp fresh?
[7:04:21] <KasiCrafter> So at what level you get to ditch the Faith medallion to slot in something else?
[7:04:27] <+Fenrisulfr_V> I agree. The Rot Worm Dragon is asscheeks.
[7:04:32] <%cade_calrayn> PRAWNS
[7:04:33] <%X2Eliah> they still walking, cant gewt any more fresh
[7:04:37] <+Fenrisulfr_V> Most of them, I don't mind.
[7:04:37] <Zourath> There's more variation in movesets between "copy-paste" bosses than there is with Echo Fighters in Smash.
[7:04:44] <%Valdorick> Speaking of Rot Worm Dragon
[7:04:46] <%BlueLunecy> Speak of the devil
[7:04:46] <sothatsprettybrutal> feels very unlikely anything down here is "dewkissed"
[7:04:54] <+BeatBoxersDevMike> RUN!!!
[7:04:57] <%luftraumm1> you gott be kidding me
[7:04:59] <%dekkitout> tajWHY
[7:05:00] <%X2Eliah> Man f* those tree spirits
[7:05:01] <+Fenrisulfr_V> YEAH
[7:05:01] <+Nomenanza> omg shut the fuck up that fucker is in there
[7:05:01] <%cade_calrayn> Is... is that the fucking ulcerated tree spirit?!
[7:05:02] <djblue_shift> i guess we know why they look like that now lol
[7:05:03] <+Fenrisulfr_V> WORST ENEMY
[7:05:04] <@Spydurman> uhhhhhh
[7:05:06] <RubberFistFight> Holy shit is that the fucking FOURTH ulcerated tree spirit?
[7:05:07] <rudiciuscaesar> what
[7:05:08] <%cade_calrayn> These fucking things
[7:05:10] <%Valdorick> Good news! That one is ALSO immune to rot!
[7:05:10] <+Nomenanza> that's just awful
[7:05:12] <%X2Eliah> I tried getting Oleg for like 2 hours and gave up
[7:05:13] <Hunk_Of_Dunk> oh fuck off that's a regular enemy now
[7:05:16] <NBUsagi> get boned i guess
[7:05:17] <+Fenrisulfr_V> @cade_calrayn There's, like, 10 of them in the game.
[7:05:17] <+TheBitingIrish> There's like 10
[7:05:18] <%strakillias> Fucking trap items
[7:05:18] <+redjack108> Guess who's back!
[7:05:21] <+Nomenanza> this is like SIXTH time
[7:05:22] <tolloponik> speaking of bosses becoming normal
[7:05:26] <%Brassnarwhal> pat did you find the holy scorpion talisman? it was basically a holy clutch ring
[7:05:29] <$Stari> Oh I missed that
[7:05:37] <nip_nips> that thing appears too often
[7:05:45] <+livi242> I skipped him
[7:05:46] <%Valdorick> I've not killed it, so I don't know what it drops
[7:05:47] <%cade_calrayn> Yeah I've seen 4 of them so far - Stormveil, under the tutorial, here, and in Mt. Gelmir
[7:05:47] <+TheBitingIrish> Chat, is the Ainsel well ultimately a dead end?
[7:05:48] <tanarath> You might want to clear before fighting it
[7:05:51] <%sniffy77> there is a lot of stuff going on in the altus plateau
[7:05:58] <%pabloelenano2> i think he drops seeds but i can be one guy
[7:05:58] <%Monkeyweed21> dont ulcerated tree spirits drop golden seeds?
[7:06:06] <jaygee303> @patstaresat nah you’re good
[7:06:07] <YouDoneBidoof> @Valdorick i think it drops golden seeds
[7:06:07] <%JustTheGuyYouNeed> I think he drops a seed
[7:06:09] <+Fenrisulfr_V> I think it drops a single dragon heart OR Golden Seed, can't remember which.
[7:06:14] <rudiciuscaesar> did you see that lmao
[7:06:21] <+Devilturnip> Oh, you're fighting the shrimp people
[7:06:24] <rudiciuscaesar> that enemy freaked out at the end of his animation
[7:06:24] <%cade_calrayn> @TheBitingIrish you can reach the bottom of Nokstellan, the giant skeleton lady in the throne from the loading screen, but that's it
[7:06:35] <%X2Eliah> Tbh the one thing that is upsetting in this game, theres not that many different armors. At around the mid-levels (where pat is), almost everyone is sporting the same carian knight armor set with some hat swaps
[7:06:36] <ape_hawk> pat, you need some Raid for these bugs, man
[7:06:39] <%cade_calrayn> Nokstellan proper requires a quest
[7:06:51] <%strakillias> get your souls tho
[7:06:57] <@Spydurman> did you get your souls back?
[7:07:01] <%Valdorick> Oh god, looking at the walls and floor makes me retch
[7:07:02] <sirrice77> @TheBitingIrish ainsel is a dead end if you got in through the elevator. The rest of it is unlocked through optional stuff elsewhere
[7:07:05] <ape_hawk> @strakillias its only 3k
[7:07:05] <%Kevlar_Caviar> nahhhh Kappa
[7:07:06] <Sigma_190_Beta> @PatStaresAt Maybe swap to the fire breath over the rot breath here?
[7:07:09] <luciluxlu0> yes you will
[7:07:10] <+Fenrisulfr_V> @PatStaresAt Don't miss the coffin.
[7:07:12] <SomeAsianDood> wtf are they praying to
[7:07:13] <rosabellamelantha> @PatStaresAt my favourite boss in the game is down here
[7:07:14] <NBUsagi> the bugs worship the rot??
[7:07:15] <+Devilturnip> Look at all them shrimp people
[7:07:16] <+Fenrisulfr_V> It's up ahead.
[7:07:18] <+TheBitingIrish> D:
[7:07:21] <luciluxlu0> one byone
[7:07:25] <+kettleroot> leg it
[7:07:26] <%X2Eliah> There sure is a lot of worshipping going on in this game
[7:07:27] <%Valdorick> He can literally not miss the coffin, let him find it
[7:07:27] <rudiciuscaesar> are these the male version of those horrible centipede ladies form DS3 lol
[7:07:29] <digaogrunge> BREATH THIS
[7:07:31] <%notsoy> CRAB PEOPLE CRAB PEOPLE
[7:07:31] <%beavnation> they just vibing down here
[7:07:37] <%pabloelenano2> i mean if the shrimps are worshiping something here, probably
[7:07:37] <rudiciuscaesar> kinda hard to assign a gender to whatever this is
[7:07:44] <Hunk_Of_Dunk> oh I hate these centipede people
[7:07:49] <@Spydurman> my big question, how does this all tie into satan???
[7:07:49] <Hunk_Of_Dunk> Just on principle
[7:07:52] <%BonewheelVanguard> Shrimps praying to the Shrimp God
[7:07:54] <+tizziks> they drop a fair ammount of runes
[7:07:54] <+BeatBoxersDevMike> shrimp bois just wanna worship the rot
[7:07:54] <+redjack108> I love to rot for really upping the "this is the worst it's ever been factor" in the soulsborne franchise so far.
[7:08:01] <%X2Eliah> this isnt the satan stuff
[7:08:04] <%Kevlar_Caviar> @Spydurman that dude's a whole different thing my man
[7:08:04] <%X2Eliah> satan was blood
[7:08:07] <%X2Eliah> this is rot
[7:08:08] <%connorfromearth> pat did you kill the npc in Godrick's boss room?
[7:08:08] <+Nomenanza> @Spydurman I think this one doesn't
[7:08:08] <+Fenrisulfr_V> God, that UGS' moveset is so sick.
[7:08:12] <tolloponik> their names are pest?
[7:08:12] <%Kevlar_Caviar> his backstory's really cool though
[7:08:18] <%BlueLunecy> Where could it have come from
[7:08:22] <@Spydurman> @Kevlar_Caviar which is CRAZY
[7:08:26] <+Nomenanza> S T E A L T H
[7:08:28] <%Valdorick> They're worshipping the temple
[7:08:29] <%X2Eliah> yeah this is weird
[7:08:31] <+Devilturnip> Too shrimp. Don't care.
[7:08:32] <%dekkitout> Not the most observant of lads, these centipeople
[7:08:36] <+BeatBoxersDevMike> praise the rot
[7:08:36] <youngin_______420> man this game just keeps getting better and better
[7:08:36] <chowndawg> what does the queens black flame do? just more damage?
[7:08:41] <%Valdorick> Inside is not progress, so check it
[7:08:42] <%Puhff> thyre just dumb
[7:08:43] <tanarath> Blind?
[7:08:44] <%X2Eliah> are we seeing another lost izalith rush-job?
[7:08:47] <%Puhff> i think
[7:08:47] <skagtheprinceofhell> Maybe because you used a Dragon spell?
[7:08:48] <%Kevlar_Caviar> @Spydurman really hope pat reads all of his lore, it's really good
[7:08:53] <%TurtlesAndTentacles> read the glaive please
[7:08:56] <Estwilde> they're all trippin on that scarlet rot
[7:08:57] <tolloponik> probably thought it was the tree serpent again
[7:08:59] <sirrice77> @chowndawg more damage and range
[7:09:01] <%BonewheelVanguard> @PatStaresAt Shrimps' Faith is more important than Shrimp death
[7:09:01] <$realm_forge> If I lived here I wouldn’t care either
[7:09:04] <+Nomenanza> @chowndawg 2 big aoe attacks and black flame does small dot afterwards
[7:09:08] <%dekkitout> Synergy!
[7:09:09] <+Nomenanza> baby's nail is back baby
[7:09:10] <%Valdorick> Rot Dagger
[7:09:11] <HeroToxiko> YES
[7:09:11] <+redjack108> OH THAT'S EVIL.
[7:09:18] <%X2Eliah> ok if theres a dagger, there will be other weapons too
[7:09:18] <KasiCrafter> Rot DOT Pog
[7:09:19] <%Valdorick> with a rapid stab attack for fast build up
[7:09:24] <%dekkitout> A hwat....
[7:09:26] <skagtheprinceofhell> BLOODBORNE!
[7:09:26] <+TheBitingIrish> monkaS
[7:09:26] <%whyskeywolfe> a what now
[7:09:27] <%X2Eliah> wait
[7:09:28] <tanarath> OH BOY
[7:09:28] <%TurtlesAndTentacles> Pat Pest G;aive
[7:09:29] <haisho> oh no Scarlet Rot is Bloodborne
[7:09:29] <chowndawg> @Nomenanza thanks
[7:09:29] <Sigma_190_Beta> IS THIS JUST CTHULHU?
[7:09:29] <%notsoy> IS THAT A BLOODBORNE
[7:09:29] <+BeatBoxersDevMike> god tail knife
[7:09:30] <%X2Eliah> wait wait
[7:09:30] <Midnight188> is that like the blood dagger but rot?!
[7:09:31] <+tizziks> Elder gods!  I knew it
[7:09:33] <Hunk_Of_Dunk> a WHATNOW
[7:09:36] <%strakillias> Duel wielding this and the bleed one would wreck
[7:09:37] <%Aeoneth> Okay that's it I'm calling it.  THIS is Bloodborne 2
[7:09:43] <%luftraumm1> you gotta do some pvp with that
[7:09:43] <MidnightPacif1c> :)
[7:09:45] <rosabellamelantha> COFFIN 2
[7:09:47] <+TheBitingIrish> There's a blood dagger way early
[7:09:48] <+Nomenanza> coffin time
[7:09:49] <+Fenrisulfr_V> Seems like Queen Marika came in and locked the door behind her.
[7:09:50] <skagtheprinceofhell> Explains the sea life
[7:09:50] <%X2Eliah> are "Outer Gods" just actual aliens? And rot is an alien lifeform?
[7:09:50] <Gray_LoFi> You got the whetstone that adds poison IIRC
[7:09:50] <%FunkyStreams> Arachnid gods are cool.
[7:09:52] <%dekkitout> Off to see Nito?
[7:09:53] <%Kevlar_Caviar> yep!
[7:09:53] <+BeatBoxersDevMike> try jumping
[7:09:53] <%notsoy> it's blood souls
[7:09:56] <Paperware> Pretty good if you don't have the dragon breath
[7:09:57] <+LandOfTheWay> not the first item we've seen that mentions Outer Gods
[7:09:59] <luciluxlu0> free ride
[7:10:00] <$realm_forge> Wait is scarlet rot like old god shit
[7:10:00] <rudiciuscaesar> .........
[7:10:01] <tanarath> What if Elden Ring was just Bloodbourne 2-4?
[7:10:06] <DracaenaLeaf> water slide!?
[7:10:06] <rudiciuscaesar> to the literal center
[7:10:09] <tolloponik> @PatStaresAt I notice there are some times were the AI bloodborne day one break don't know what causes it though because I don't do long sessions
[7:10:13] <%BlueLunecy> This one is far less safe than the first one
[7:10:13] <bassoontyphoon> Niagara Falls time
[7:10:14] <%BonewheelVanguard> Coffin dance but with Shrimps'
[7:10:15] <Midnight188> that is levels of ouch that fill me with evil glee...."oh just you wait, baddies. this one'll be extra fun"
[7:10:15] <%Kevlar_Caviar> @X2Eliah it's explained WAY later in item descs
[7:10:16] <vance168> This is some straight REDNECK SHIT XD
[7:10:17] <chowndawg> sickest slide
[7:10:18] <+redjack108> This way better than Niagra in a barrel.
[7:10:18] <%Puhff> lesgo bois
[7:10:20] <oda_flobunaga> the good bit.....
[7:10:20] <ape_hawk> is scarlet rot just God Blood?
[7:10:21] <+ShazBo2000> back where you belong
[7:10:21] <Hunk_Of_Dunk> Always with the coffins
[7:10:22] <brungoboy> alright lets get into it
[7:10:22] <Zourath> Elden Ring seems to be something like 3-4 apocalypses all about to happen at once, but they are all somehow precariously balancing each-other out.
[7:10:24] <+Devilturnip> This is my coffin. I just hang out here.
[7:10:24] <sothatsprettybrutal> whee!

[7:12:38] <+Nomenanza> doable

[7:12:43] <+kettleroot> Earth Shakers
[7:12:43] <brungoboy> HES SO FUCKING SICK
[7:12:44] <rudiciuscaesar> that is the great onest thing
[7:12:45] <%X2Eliah> dud its made out of stars and planets
[7:12:45] <+PARARScs> astel is worse than bed of chaos
[7:12:45] <%whyskeywolfe> This is gonna be a rough one
[7:12:49] <+Devilturnip> I simply would not fight that thing
[7:12:50] <+Fenrisulfr_V> I CAN'T WAIT FOR MAX TO GET HERE
[7:12:50] <Gray_LoFi> It's one of those rock-shooty-centipedes, but glowy
[7:12:50] <Ardailec> Man Namiel sure looks different
[7:12:53] <Maids4lyfe> jesus christ what the fuck is that thing?
[7:12:53] <rudiciuscaesar> did it have a human face?
[7:12:54] <%Kevlar_Caviar> ...i mean, it DID kill you tho
[7:12:55] <trasherxl> imagine being buried and then your coffin slips throught some cracks and ends in the hell-lake of space plague in untold depths
[7:12:56] <%MaybeFalco> this fight is tough
[7:12:56] <DanThePumpkinman> that thing has a pseudo human skull?
[7:12:59] <%notsoy> nothing is worse than bed of chaos foh
[7:13:00] <+BeatBoxersDevMike> you got this!
[7:13:01] <%dekkitout> From Daughter of the Cosmos to Naturalborn of the Void
[7:13:02] <+thesw1tch> are those glowing weak points like RE
[7:13:04] <@Spydurman> everybody settle in for the next hour of boss fight, lets goooooo
[7:13:08] <chowndawg> it looks like its body is made up of a small solar system
[7:13:09] <%cascadepersona> This confirms Gravity spells come from aliens
[7:13:09] <%X2Eliah> Man I do NOT look forward to having to fight that
[7:13:15] <SubjectX07x> It has a skull head, but there's something twitching inside of the crack in its skull.
[7:13:16] <DracaenaLeaf> looked like a skull
[7:13:17] <+PARARScs> guy floats around for 7 minutes
[7:13:18] <digaogrunge> ROT HIM
[7:13:18] <Maids4lyfe> I was making spaghetti and came back to this nightmarish sin against god
[7:13:19] <%Aeoneth> This game is ACTUALLY giving me anxiety because of all this fucking rad shit
[7:13:24] <XxMoliciousxX> wait, that's the COLOR OUT OF SPACE
[7:13:24] <+PARARScs> at least bed of chaos u can get through fast
[7:13:26] <Hunk_Of_Dunk> Wait, is the meteor totally unrelated to the rot, then?
[7:13:27] <+tizziks> This really is one damn good looking game
[7:13:28] <Ardailec> Man it's not every day you see a dragonfly made of DNA
[7:13:28] <+Nomenanza> it's the same thing that was hanging out from the ceilings underground earlier. Just bigger and meaner
[7:13:29] <RyuuAoi> You fell into a black hole, Pat
[7:13:31] <%pabloelenano2> @X2Eliah  i do want to fight that thing so bad
[7:13:32] <%Aeoneth> I'm worriesd I'm going to be ruined for all games to come
[7:13:32] <youngin_______420> cool
[7:13:38] <rudiciuscaesar> oh yeah, kinda does have a human face
[7:13:38] <NewWillinium> It has the Antlion Pincers.
[7:13:38] <+678saintglock> its moves are surprisingly easy to dodge
[7:13:39] <dashmatt> Great design
[7:13:42] <$bravebravesrobin> what in Bloodborne is this?
[7:13:43] <Maids4lyfe> that laser is cool as fuck okay
[7:13:43] <Hunk_Of_Dunk> I just figured that the rot was related to the meteor because it seemed like the crater was FULL OF the juice
[7:13:43] <+ShazBo2000> mmmmm cosmic horror
[7:13:49] <NewWillinium> Has everything that has had those Void born?

[7:14:13] <%Brassnarwhal> no rot
[7:14:14] <youngin_______420> awesome
[7:14:15] <%Valdorick> It can be rotted, it teleported away before you could app- there you go
[7:14:16] <%Kevlar_Caviar> for those curious: in this universe, stars are living beings, and sometimes they turn into THIS
[7:14:22] <%pabloelenano2> run down the clock now
[7:14:26] <%vance168> You CAN ROT hell yeah!
[7:14:27] <+LandOfTheWay> lore-wise, rot SHOULD work on this
[7:14:27] <Estwilde> rot applied? PogChamp
[7:14:28] <+thesw1tch> even a void creature rots... that's fucked
[7:14:28] <@Spydurman> if it can rot it can die
[7:14:31] <+BeatBoxersDevMike> work your magic, rot
[7:14:33] <%Brassnarwhal> ROT!
[7:14:46] <NBUsagi> So gravity magic is just straight up alien magic
[7:14:50] <youngin_______420> mimic
[7:14:50] <%Eldalu> too close, TOO CLOSE
[7:14:52] <%Brassnarwhal> save mana to reaapply rot later
[7:14:55] <rudiciuscaesar> it's like an Ebrietas void in its skulllll
[7:14:57] <%luftraumm1> rom shit
[7:14:57] <Hunk_Of_Dunk> oh jesus christ there IS something in there
[7:14:57] <+Fenrisulfr_V> I've killed this thing, and I never saw it do that pincer stab.
[7:15:01] <%dekkitout> Hey wait a sec- that's Rom's gimmick
[7:15:06] <Midnight188> Ebrietas? Is that you?!
[7:15:07] <%Valdorick> Equip nothing but Dragon Spells and summon Greg with a casting weapon on
[7:15:08] <%Aeoneth> I WANT WHATEVER DRUGS FROM AND/OR GRRM WERE ON WHEN THEY MADE THIS
[7:15:13] <NewWillinium> Rom finally hatched from his Larval stage

[7:15:25] <Estwilde> This game is incredible
[7:15:28] <GhostPyre> Greg putting in work
[7:15:31] <SubjectX07x> Dead

[7:15:51] <%MartinOfLoxley> Good show
[7:15:51] <Midnight188> aaaaaaaand Vore'd
[7:15:51] <+kekkerscrew> That cheap Mother effer
[7:15:52] <@Spydurman> 30% health tho
[7:15:53] <%Brassnarwhal> unlucky
[7:15:55] <$realm_forge> OM NOM NOM
[7:15:56] <SubjectX07x> If that thing teleports you DO NOT want to be locked in an animation.
[7:15:57] <%MaybeFalco> i don't know if you can live through that grab even at full hp, but im pretty sure its always done on a teleport
[7:16:01] <%rumtumtugnutz> get fucked lol
[7:16:03] <+Fenrisulfr_V> What a boss, dude. Shit's incredible.
[7:16:05] <%cade_calrayn> it's like that thing you fought in the Uhl Palace Ruins
[7:16:06] <SubjectX07x> Because that teleport grab will kill you for sure.
[7:16:08] <bassoontyphoon> GET STICKBUGGED
[7:16:11] <jaygee303> 7k damage
[7:16:12] <+SpiritRoads> all grabs kill
[7:16:14] <Paperware> Got eaten by a Space Anal Bead
[7:16:16] <$0ddeye> Same eyeball and pincers
[7:16:17] <%Monkeyweed21> We saw the larval and adolescent forms earlier
[7:16:21] <digaogrunge> drink buff
[7:16:21] <+redjack108> They're in space.
[7:16:24] <%Valdorick> You were at the back of the room
[7:16:26] <%pabloelenano2> all the way to the left
[7:16:26] <Hunk_Of_Dunk> Well, the other one said it was a "Fully-Grown Starspawn" didn't it?
[7:16:27] <+redjack108> Don't worry about it.
[7:16:28] <TheBlankAce> So this thing is dragonfly like and one of the basic overworld enemies are dragonflies, is that related?
[7:16:34] <jaygee303> The rail gun ranged attack is the best
[7:16:37] <Sigma_190_Beta> They're all the way to the right I thought.
[7:16:39] <+meinsodapop> Chomp chomp
[7:16:41] <+Fenrisulfr_V> @PatStaresAt I'm convinced bosses do %HP damage instead of flat amounts. I had 40 Vigor when I came here, and I was getting insta-gibbed
[7:16:47] <dereksbales> whats the lore on this beast
[7:16:47] <vVAstrAVv> i think its the father of the smaller ones like midgardzomer
[7:16:52] <%Brassnarwhal> i have to sleep for work again good luck pat sending my spirit bomb energy up
[7:16:58] <%BinaryFireball> this guy is a trip
[7:17:11] <Sheepeze> I genuinely love how every Fromsoft game starts normal with dudes in armor and then swaps hard to lovecraft
[7:17:27] <SubjectX07x> Surprised that thing can take scarlet rot damage.
[7:17:30] <%Puhff> @TheBlankAce it's alos got elements of scorpion and there's all kinds of scorpion items in the game
[7:17:33] <%Valdorick> Gravity damage is magic based, so if you're getting trucked, just equip the magic resist talisman.
[7:17:40] <HeroToxiko> i watched enemies fight eachother and they all did percentage before going back to 100 per hit on me
[7:17:42] <+SpiritRoads> he grabbed greg
[7:17:43] <%pabloelenano2> your coppy is taking it like a champ
[7:17:51] <MidnightPacif1c> go greg go
[7:17:52] <Vermillion129> he might resist magic
[7:17:54] <+Fenrisulfr_V> Imagine showing a DS1 player this boss in 2012.
[7:17:55] <+Tyk1337> This boss is morbid and beautiful!
[7:17:55] <SubjectX07x> It's glintstone pat, Glintstone sorceries come from the stars.
[7:17:59] <SubjectX07x> This thing is made of stars.
[7:18:00] <+TheBitingIrish> So I tried fighting Smarag and they fucked off at about half health and now I can't find them?
[7:18:10] <%dekkitout> The orange parts?
[7:18:12] <SubjectX07x> Crazy talk
[7:18:12] <Wakerz140> Correct
[7:18:13] <+LandOfTheWay> @dereksbales it was the big meteor that was part of the starshower radahn was holding back. turns out quite a few fuckers like this live up in the heavens, but thanks to the erdtree they're usually not a problem
[7:18:13] <%BinaryFireball> must smash face
[7:18:18] <ape_hawk> POKE HIS BUTT
[7:18:19] <Vermillion129> F
[7:18:21] <+678saintglock> @pabloelenano2 upgraded mimic is BIG strong
[7:18:24] <Estwilde> The rot is doing good damage
[7:18:25] <rudiciuscaesar> awww it has facial expressions tooo fucking weird
[7:18:29] <%BinaryFireball> if you fight this melee its a nightmare
[7:18:33] <%Valdorick> You were hitting his butt was the problem
[7:18:34] <jaygee303> No it’s the face
[7:18:35] <Sgt_Wigglytuff> He was grabning the mimic and had i frames
[7:18:35] <+handfulofslugs> Maybe you were jsut hetting it from the wrong end.
[7:18:35] <%MaybeFalco> nice
[7:18:39] <%SveriSageAdvice> nice
[7:18:40] <luciluxlu0> dragon is so good
[7:18:40] <%BinaryFireball> nice
[7:18:41] <%Valdorick> not even 15 minutes on this boss
[7:18:41] <+LandOfTheWay> NICE
[7:18:43] <@QueequegTheater> @BinaryFireball I had it easy tbg
[7:18:43] <sirrice77> @TheBitingIrish if thats the magic dragon at three sisters thats supposed to happen, he'll show up later if you do rannis quest
[7:18:45] <HeroToxiko> literally
[7:18:45] <@QueequegTheater> *tbh
[7:18:45] <+TheBitingIrish> Oh shit, the orange bits are like the amber Rennala has
[7:18:47] <%X2Eliah> note to self - get dragon breaths

[7:18:50] <+BeatBoxersDevMike> nice
[7:18:52] <%notsoy> LEGEND FELLED damn
[7:18:52] <Hunk_Of_Dunk> I feel like this game is a NIGHTMARE on melee-only
[7:18:54] <+CatRidder> pat wins
[7:18:54] <chowndawg> grab runes
[7:18:54] <tolloponik> the coolest things about the phantom summons is you can actually see the bosses move set without dying
[7:18:55] <brungoboy> sick fucking boss bro
[7:18:55] <dereksbales> @LandOfTheWay damn
[7:18:58] <Estwilde> That boss looks wild. Like some interstellar protein chain
[7:18:58] <Gray_LoFi> LEGEND FELLED, strong
[7:19:03] <digaogrunge> Greg too strong
[7:19:07] <SubjectX07x> Alright, now to see Ranni's quest through to the end.
[7:19:08] <%Kevlar_Caviar> @PatStaresAt in this universe, stars are living beings, and sometimes they turn into THIS for some reason
[7:19:11] <%pabloelenano2> @678saintglock i need to get one
[7:19:15] <%BinaryFireball> I kept getting one shot by his shenanigans until I learned to run far away after an attack
[7:19:16] <%whyskeywolfe> Astel? I'm more of an Aruran guy
[7:19:17] <rosabellamelantha> @PatStaresAt that thing basically just dropped in on a meteor from bloodborne
[7:19:19] <%cade_calrayn> that's what took out what?
[7:19:22] <%Valdorick> That's the beast the Greater Will sent out to fuck over Nokron
[7:19:23] <tolloponik> 80K
[7:19:24] <Hunk_Of_Dunk> It's fucking lavos?
[7:19:25] <+Nomenanza> Nokron literally bloodborne'd itself
[7:19:28] <tolloponik> damn
[7:19:34] <Samuraiflame> time to spend souls
[7:19:35] <+Nomenanza> you have to go north to progress
[7:19:35] <+tizziks> go north
[7:19:36] <SubjectX07x> You wanna go to the smaller area.
[7:19:37] <rudiciuscaesar> so does that make Pat a starscourge now or whatever, isn't that what Radahn was fighting against?
[7:19:37] <+meinsodapop> Naisu
[7:19:38] <mountain_megatherium> Lost Ark Ad...ew.
[7:19:40] <+Nomenanza> thankfully you got a ring
[7:19:41] <%Puhff> but how it get here????
[7:19:41] <djblue_shift> so radahn was holding these fucks back?
[7:19:42] <Maids4lyfe> it was a lavos, now it's a deadvos
[7:19:44] <+Tyk1337> What are the most aesthetically pleasing Souls bosses?
[7:19:46] <jubejube56> Poetic in a sense that you beat it with a creation of nokron
[7:19:50] <bassoontyphoon> Free level
[7:19:55] <%notsoy> TALK TO HER
[7:20:06] <%Valdorick> He can't talk to the doll anymore
[7:20:09] <+LandOfTheWay> @kevlar_caviar i've been lore-diving and i'm not sure that isn't just poetic metaphor, considering all these things fall from space like falling stars
[7:20:09] <%Valdorick> its cold and lifeless now
[7:20:10] <rosabellamelantha> Can't
[7:20:11] <Zourath> So Lavos, Satan, and Crazy Hand walk into a planet...
[7:20:11] <+Nomenanza> @notsoy cant talk to Ranni at this point.
[7:20:12] <Sigma_190_Beta> @notsoy You can't.
[7:20:12] <rosabellamelantha> she's not there
[7:20:16] <Strigiform> north passage would be sealed by magic if you didn't have the darkmoon ring
[7:20:17] <NaberiustheNefarious> that was the coolest boss I've ever saw
[7:20:19] <%notsoy> well she is dead
[7:20:22] <%MartinOfLoxley> Your souls should still be around
[7:20:25] <%notsoy> makes sense
[7:20:25] <%SaiyanShoto> I can’t wait to watch a Vatti video that puts the story together
[7:20:33] <SubjectX07x> Level 90-100 is apparently the recommended area for the endgame.
[7:20:38] <%luftraumm1> where the fuck
[7:20:39] <twoto858> Going up this time
[7:20:41] <SubjectX07x> level area*
[7:20:44] <%MartinOfLoxley> Oh, I'm blind
[7:20:47] <oda_flobunaga> @PatStaresAt are you ready for the real Boss?
[7:20:47] <rudiciuscaesar> wait, so this is beyond that boss?
[7:20:50] <+Nomenanza> it's THAT zone
[7:20:51] <+Fenrisulfr_V> Mind fuck time
[7:20:52] <%X2Eliah> THATS HOW
[7:20:53] <rudiciuscaesar> this isn't how Pat got here right?
[7:20:54] <%notsoy> he might have to play it like 4 times lmao
[7:20:56] <+Nomenanza> I was so happy when I reached it
[7:20:57] <djblue_shift> OH IT TOTALLY WAS UNDER THE PLATEAU
[7:20:59] <%Valdorick> Yeyeyeye
[7:21:00] <+redjack108> Vaati is in employment for the next twenty years at least.
[7:21:03] <djblue_shift> i knew it
[7:21:04] <$0ddeye> @SubjectX07x I ended up at level 137 when I finished just due to all the exploring and gear hunting
[7:21:04] <rudiciuscaesar> ohhhhh
[7:21:06] <%shootbang_exe> get ready for screenshots
[7:21:10] <%dekkitout> This altar better have a greatsword
[7:21:14] <%TurtlesAndTentacles> You know some people dont know where Vaati name comes from. Lot of people need to play more Zelda
[7:21:14] <+BeatBoxersDevMike> you... did it
[7:21:18] <SubjectX07x> I was 145 when I finished myself lol.
[7:21:19] <Ner234> Vaatia eating good for the next ten years.
[7:21:20] <+charp35> Oh thats how you get here
[7:21:25] <Sgt_Wigglytuff> Bosses grabing have i frames for future reference, why your breath did no damage that one time
[7:21:25] <%shootbang_exe> look up
[7:21:25] <Sigma_190_Beta> WHAT IS UP WITHT HE SKY?

[7:21:45] <digaogrunge> THATS HOW YOU GET HERE?
[7:21:52] <+redjack108> Man. This game is so fucking good looking.
[7:21:55] <%jkips56> I’m so glad that I now know I won’t be getting up there for a while
[7:21:56] <SubjectX07x> Hey guess what
[7:21:57] <skagtheprinceofhell> Walk into the moon light
[7:22:02] <+handfulofslugs> This game looks so good, I hope a mod comes out where oyu can just explore it to sight see.
[7:22:05] <%Aeoneth> THAT'S HOW YOU GET THERE?
[7:22:06] <SubjectX07x> HEEEEE'S BAAAACK

[7:22:40] <%dekkitout> Where can you get THAT spell
[7:22:41] <rudiciuscaesar> that was not what I expected that attack to do....
[7:22:43] <Parapattern> He been trainin
[7:22:45] <+eanscrale> yes
[7:22:46] <Ner234> he mad
[7:22:48] <rosabellamelantha> @PatStaresAt this is the worst dragon in the game I hate him
[7:22:51] <SubjectX07x> I cheesed this guy super hard.
[7:22:53] <AtisutoCurry> YEAHHHHHHHHHHHH YEAH YEAHHHH
[7:22:54] <vVAstrAVv> he clled you a biiiitch
[7:23:01] <%Monkeyweed21> @ajeanstarks78 30ish, then 50ish for the big dungeon after that and so on
[7:23:01] <$Stari> There’s a grace in the building behind him
[7:23:02] <sparked963> 25 to 30 is good
[7:23:07] <oda_flobunaga> define worst.
[7:23:08] <%whyskeywolfe> Lansseax says hi
[7:23:10] <%pabloelenano2> ok this ads 5 dragons to my list
[7:23:15] <@Spydurman> he got his ass beat and went training like Goku for round 2
[7:23:15] <rosabellamelantha> Mimic did NOT help me here
[7:23:20] <+Fenrisulfr_V> I just kept ducking in and out of the church and conking her on the head.
[7:23:22] <$0ddeye> 20 to 30 for stormveil
[7:23:24] <%SaiyanShoto> Ohhh Pat beats a cosmic horror and now he’s getting cocky
[7:23:24] <%Valdorick> She's the Moon Dragon, she has no alter spell tied to her.
[7:23:25] <+hoenhime344> ahhh i see he got the ditto
[7:23:26] <oda_flobunaga> He's got lots of cover you can exploit to chumpify him
[7:23:30] <tanarath> Do a bunch of shit south of stormveil & have a +5 weapon or higher that Fuchs stuff up
[7:23:35] <%X2Eliah> meed hors?
[7:23:38] <rosabellamelantha> Lansseax is cool
[7:23:42] <rudiciuscaesar> aw man, he got his blue stuff everywhere
[7:23:44] <rosabellamelantha> this guy is a pain
[7:23:48] <%greasypete00> Time for horseback battle
[7:23:54] <AtisutoCurry> oh man
[7:23:56] <SubjectX07x> His fire breath attacks are extremely lethal.
[7:23:56] <+SpiritRoads> there's a grace immediately behind him if you want to start closer to it
[7:23:56] <vVAstrAVv> i you can use horse btw
[7:24:02] <SubjectX07x> One shots pretty much all the time.
[7:24:06] <%whyskeywolfe> oh, that kind of worst
[7:24:06] <NaberiustheNefarious> I rushed the capital with no runes then went back and fought everyone with a +12 weapon
[7:24:08] <rudiciuscaesar> horseback battle, don't forget the rot dagger
[7:24:09] <%X2Eliah> stormveil is good at around 20+
[7:24:17] <+redjack108> Honestly, I'm not sure if there's a recommended level for much of anything in this game really. There's just figuring out when you're ready for it.
[7:24:21] <$0ddeye> Just walk past it, Mario Bros strat, always wins
[7:24:40] <+BeatBoxersDevMike> im not a fan of the boss fights that are designed around horseback riding
[7:24:49] <%SilvaChariot0133> Dragon ironmouseSHRUG
[7:24:51] <%Valdorick> Yeah, she's a dragon
[7:24:51] <SubjectX07x> Well of course pat, He's a dragon
[7:24:51] <badguy8312> canon!
[7:24:52] <%dekkitout> I coulda guess that

[7:25:45] <rudiciuscaesar> don't forget that barrier spell
[7:25:45] <%notsoy> but dragon-types resist electric moves though, except in dark souls
[7:25:46] <%Valdorick> I cheesed her to death
[7:25:51] <SubjectX07x> @bassoontyphoon Yes
[7:25:57] <Sigma_190_Beta> @luftraumm1 He doesn't have that on.

[7:26:49] <%JustTheGuyYouNeed> The best way to fight dragons its on the horse
[7:26:50] <%luftraumm1> @luftraumm1 oh right probably took it off comoing off the rot hell
[7:26:51] <+Edrem> I hug the shit out of their wing hands, tends to screw up all their attacks
[7:26:53] <%Puhff> @genepark what build you runnin?
[7:27:01] <+BeatBoxersDevMike> see, the solution is to make rubber armor for the dragons
[7:27:11] <vVAstrAVv> hes gotta get off horse to give the dragon the crotch rot
[7:27:16] <%genepark> Int build
[7:27:25] <vVAstrAVv> and summon
[7:27:26] <NaberiustheNefarious> thank god for spirits

[7:28:19] <bassoontyphoon> Super fun boss
[7:28:26] <Sigma_190_Beta> Also remember to use your Flask.
[7:28:27] <digaogrunge> The flask free hit tho
[7:28:32] <+hoenhime344> see you Kappa after dont get hit... but if dragons were real... dont get hit
[7:28:39] <+Fenrisulfr_V> You might want to aim for the head with your lightning. Does WAY more damage
[7:28:41] <%Valdorick> @crimsonomen0 Funny enough, I like the 1 cost one better, because it can be applied from horseback
[7:29:04] <GhostPyre> Nice dodge

[7:32:16] <%Kevlar_Caviar> @DestroPrime83 nope
[7:32:16] <+hoenhime344> it so much fun coming from woolie to pat... its like, seeing a fawn wabble then looking at a mountain goat climb vertical cliffs
[7:32:18] <Hunk_Of_Dunk> It is not THE sword
[7:32:24] <+eanscrale> It will be a great gift, just in time for christmas
[7:32:30] <Sigma_190_Beta> @PatStaresAt Why is your channel name Pat instead of your real name, Greg?
[7:32:31] <badguy8312> doubt that's THE one
[7:32:32] <rosabellamelantha> Oh this cutscene is gonna be SO WEIRD with the mushroom head
[7:32:32] <fierysnowflakes> @DestroPrime83 Yesn't

[7:32:49] <Midnight188> Manus?
[7:32:49] <NaberiustheNefarious> absolute cookie trail
[7:32:52] <%Valdorick> @JDlightside Its a combination of factors, including players not leveling up health, being in places early because its an open world game, and this being an end game location.
[7:32:54] <badguy8312> @dekkitout no, it's Manuel
[7:32:55] <+flexin_apex> Invite Greg to the podcast
[7:32:56] <coreyyotto> ... Manus
[7:32:59] <%MaybeFalco> you should check that hole out
[7:33:02] <rosabellamelantha> Hole time
[7:33:02] <+AyupaPupa> ooh a piece of candy

[7:33:25] <badguy8312> Lucas final smash lookin ass sky
[7:33:26] <+Fenrisulfr_V> I'd advise ditching the hat as well for this next bit.
[7:33:27] <%Kevlar_Caviar> @PatStaresAt might wanna take off the mushroom head to avoid ruining the upcoming cutscene LUL
[7:33:27] <%SveriSageAdvice> does his hat upset you? lol
[7:33:29] <oda_flobunaga> @PatStaresAt Try hole
[7:33:32] <Hunk_Of_Dunk> It's why manus has a big prominent hand. because he's named after a hand.
[7:33:34] <rosabellamelantha> I agree with the other guy
[7:33:44] <%MaybeFalco> into the woolie hole
[7:33:46] <+Fenrisulfr_V> @SveriSageAdvice Can't say why because of spoilers.

[7:36:27] <SomeAsianDood> Moonlight greatsword PogBones
[7:36:28] <SubjectX07x> @PatStaresAt If this is the ending you want, all you have to do now is get to the games end and she'll have a summon sign there.
[7:36:28] <skagtheprinceofhell> POWER AQUIRED
[7:36:29] <+eanscrale> Ah you were at my side... all along!
[7:36:30] <%dekkitout> Hold on, how many moon swords are in this damn game?
[7:36:30] <badguy8312> OH
[7:36:32] <%MartinOfLoxley> LUL Every game!
[7:36:32] <+imthinkingdarbys> yeah that's why i'm not concerned with spoilers from watching, not like i'll understand it anyway
[7:36:33] <+redjack108> Think about wife.
[7:36:33] <Wakerz140> Now her questline is finished
[7:36:36] <Strigiform> the pure int greatsword and it hits so hard
[7:36:36] <%greasypete00> IT LOOKS GREAT
[7:36:37] <+Nomenanza> Officially wife'd
[7:36:37] <%Valdorick> "You want to bang? Beat the game"
[7:36:37] <insomniac_doze_> swords>maidens
[7:36:38] <skagtheprinceofhell> WAIFU AQUIRED
[7:36:38] <%SveriSageAdvice> a version of Moonlight Greatsword that you dont have to worry about the durability
[7:36:39] <%notsoy> MOONLIGHT GREATSWORD?!?!?!
[7:36:40] <badguy8312> my guiding moonlight
[7:36:43] <%tetraes> its a frost sword
[7:36:43] <%Ynkubus_> nice
[7:36:47] <%luftraumm1> is it int?
[7:36:50] <+Nomenanza> Now you can go back to Ranni's rise
[7:36:51] <%notsoy> an int GS? damn
[7:36:52] <badguy8312> oh hey guts
[7:36:52] <skagtheprinceofhell> We are a Lord truly now
[7:36:54] <Zalapski> by the POWER OF GRAYSKULL
[7:36:54] <MidnightPacif1c> my guiding moonlight
[7:36:56] <brungoboy> Wife is a star but cool sword so we good
[7:36:57] <Saltmeisterr> MY GUIDING MOONLIGHT
[7:36:57] <%notsoy> where's the guts sword tho
[7:36:58] <%Valdorick> The Cathedral of Hands
[7:37:00] <+Fenrisulfr_V> @luftraumm1 Yeah.
[7:37:02] <tanarath> @luftraumm1 it is!
[7:37:05] <SubjectX07x> There's still quite a bit of stuff here.
[7:37:05] <MidnightPacif1c> blaidd?
[7:37:06] <Hunk_Of_Dunk> Is there any version of the moonlight greatsword that isn't int?
[7:37:08] <+Edrem> She has a special grace in her old room with more dialogue
[7:37:10] <ralfbat> my guiding moonlight
[7:37:10] <%SveriSageAdvice> you can fire as many slices from the sword as you want with no worry of FP cost either
[7:37:15] <WillSin4Cash> idk if i like the icy blue look to it in this one but cool enough still I guess
[7:37:17] <SubjectX07x> I think there's 2 ruins, an evergaol and a rise here.
[7:37:21] <+Fenrisulfr_V> Pro tip for anyone that wants to use it. Get minimum physical requirements then pump Int for maximized damage.
[7:37:24] <Sunstalker> Hunk_Of_Dunk Demons's souls was faith
[7:37:27] <DestroPrime83> End of Rannis quest?
[7:37:28] <%X2Eliah> So if she killed the two fingers, whats up with the two fingers at the round table
[7:37:28] <%Puhff> Iji also has new dialogue
[7:37:29] <tanarath> I think it either summons swords or does a sword-wave.
[7:37:30] <%xcompleasedad> I think that will change the ending, if by only a Smidge
[7:37:32] <vVAstrAVv> @hunk_of_dunk its fth in des
[7:37:33] <+Nomenanza> oh of course didnt want to be pushy
[7:37:43] <Hunk_Of_Dunk> Oh, well, shows what I know
[7:37:45] <%BinaryFireball> moonlight is very good if you can kite an enemy
[7:37:48] <%Valdorick> You really lucked out
[7:37:52] <Hunk_Of_Dunk> It's been int since, though, right?
[7:37:54] <luciluxlu0> @x2eliah different fingers
[7:37:58] <Frostydough1> Hey guys did I miss Pat fighting that sick ass optional boss? Ya know the one…
[7:37:59] <+BeatBoxersDevMike> "magic missile!"
[7:38:01] <%Valdorick> with the dragon dragging you over here and those fuckers not aggroing
[7:38:06] <Hunk_Of_Dunk> though I think bloodborne called int something else
[7:38:08] <%SveriSageAdvice> towards the north
[7:38:21] <Vermillion129> will it be invisible like last time
[7:38:24] <%TurtlesAndTentacles> Another illusion one I bet
[7:38:29] <+Fenrisulfr_V> I think I did 2k damage off of one structure break on a late-game boss with it.
[7:38:37] <%notsoy> lmao there really is another illusory floor? fuck
[7:38:39] <%notsoy> LMFAOOOOO
[7:38:39] <Vermillion129> oh god it is
[7:38:43] <%greasypete00> there was arcane and bloodtinge for int and faith @Hunk_Of_Dunk
[7:38:45] <@Spydurman> jesus
[7:38:50] <Estwilde> PogChamp
[7:38:51] <Shardlab> Oh no....
[7:38:57] <%Valdorick> I forget, what was it
[7:38:58] <$0ddeye> Built my whole character around that sword, and ended up respeccing pretty quick. Not as cool as BB MGS and feels weak.
[7:39:20] <rosabellamelantha> @0ddeye it's actually the strongest it's ever been
[7:39:23] <%Valdorick> Oh that place fucks
[7:39:32] <%pabloelenano2> really him again
[7:39:33] <Vermillion129> kek
[7:39:35] <rosabellamelantha> it builds up frost super fast and staggers well
[7:39:38] <%cade_calrayn> Dragons EVERYWHERE
[7:39:38] <%dekkitout> Maybe rubberfist had a point
[7:39:39] <rudiciuscaesar> .......
[7:39:40] <%X2Eliah> not even a boss lifebar
[7:39:43] <%Valdorick> Oh by the way Pat, Adula gave you 3 hearts
[7:39:45] <skagtheprinceofhell> That's a normal enemy
[7:39:48] <+CatRidder> its sleeping why fight  them
[7:39:49] <Sgt_Wigglytuff> Yeah the BB MLGS Is soooo good
[7:39:54] <penitentpendant> No boss subtitle
[7:39:57] <SubjectX07x> Getting a weapon that requires somber stones to +10 is rough since there are VERY few of the ancient somber stones in the game.
[7:39:58] <+redjack108> GUESS GUESS WHO'S BACK
[7:40:11] <SubjectX07x> Different one.
[7:40:12] <Vermillion129> smaller
[7:40:17] <ChunLoArt> different
[7:40:18] <%JustTheGuyYouNeed> It's just a normal dragon
[7:40:19] <SubjectX07x> There's like 4 up here lol.
[7:40:19] <+emoprawn> just a generic drago, no reward
[7:40:20] <%Valdorick> Nah, its just another Magic dragon
[7:40:20] <Shardlab> BACK AGAIN
[7:40:21] <Strigiform> generic dragoo
[7:40:21] <%X2Eliah> this one is ice?
[7:40:21] <%TurtlesAndTentacles> I love that dragons arent extinct in this world
[7:40:23] <tolloponik> legally distinct
[7:40:24] <%Monkeyweed21> same strength as the lake dragon
[7:40:27] <rudiciuscaesar> just lame him out
[7:40:30] <SubjectX07x> He will
[7:40:30] <+emoprawn> no
[7:40:33] <%Valdorick> They will all give you a heart
[7:40:34] <%watts121> Aw shit I missed Pat doing Naturalborn.
[7:40:37] <digaogrunge> Wahy less health
[7:40:54] <zenith0111> Why are you not charging the casts?
[7:40:57] <+hoenhime344> 14k
[7:41:01] <%X2Eliah> You know this game really is the modern day skyrim
[7:41:01] <Vermillion129> still hit as hard LUL
[7:41:06] <Estwilde> ow
[7:41:11] <%Valdorick> There's 3 of them, do it off camera
[7:41:22] <tanarath> @watts121 he did it in 2 or 3 attempts, I think
[7:41:25] <zenith0111> Oh. Fair enough he is scary
[7:41:28] <%luftraumm1> godamn 3?
[7:41:37] <+Pendragwn> @X2Eliah what do you mean skyrim was just released this year Kappa
[7:41:39] <%Monkeyweed21> this is the dragon heart farm if you need more
[7:41:45] <+Fenrisulfr_V> They're Adula's babies.
[7:41:47] <%X2Eliah> Are you not 100%ing it?
[7:41:57] <Hunk_Of_Dunk> Instead of unlocking one, it just gave you the spell directly
[7:42:00] <%Valdorick> Yeah, Adula just gives the sorc. There are extra dragons past the Lift though
[7:42:03] <+BeatBoxersDevMike> there's large parts of this particular landmass without stuff in it
[7:42:07] <CingKanada> Are you going to be streaming the FF14 news letter in 6 hours?
[7:42:09] <%Valdorick> so if you run low on hearts up there, just remember this place
[7:42:16] <%cade_calrayn> what about a lightning dragon?
[7:42:19] <+hoenhime344> @PatStaresAt  it gave you spell directly
[7:42:22] <+AyupaPupa> funsies
[7:42:24] <SubjectX07x> It's for the rise
[7:42:27] <zenith0111> But why indeed
[7:42:33] <%Valdorick> This guy FUCKS
[7:42:33] <Wakerz140> Why will be apparent later
[7:42:33] <Vermillion129> cos it's cool to jump high
[7:42:35] <sirrice77> this one gave me a little trouble
[7:42:35] <%cade_calrayn> well that sounds important
[7:42:41] <Strigiform> Im pretty sure this area is scaled for near endgame difficulty
[7:42:42] <+AyupaPupa> this guy must be behind it all!
[7:42:43] <%SveriSageAdvice> lmao, nah Pat is probably going to just go to bed and catch the news later tomorrow @CingKanada
[7:42:44] <%MaybeFalco> ringleader fucks
[7:42:45] <badguy8312> why do people call these jails when it's spelled gaol
[7:42:46] <oda_flobunaga> @PatStaresAt I'm also going Poison and Rot but I have them both on 1 weapon
[7:42:57] <+Nomenanza> this one was still easier than Crucible knight
[7:42:57] <%cade_calrayn> oh nooooo
[7:42:58] <vVAstrAVv> i cheesed this guy with mlgs lol
[7:42:59] <%SveriSageAdvice> dude has been streaming since 5 EST today
[7:42:59] <Sgt_Wigglytuff> This guy is kinda hard
[7:43:00] <+Nomenanza> super staggarable
[7:43:03] <zenith0111> Yeyeye
[7:43:05] <tanarath> Oh yeah!
[7:43:10] <badguy8312> so many edgelords sealed away
[7:43:10] <$Stari> @badguy8312 It’s old English for jail
[7:43:13] <+TheBitingIrish> Don't get grabbed
[7:43:13] <%dekkitout> Alright, you dexy motherfucker
[7:43:15] <%X2Eliah> oh jeez
[7:43:15] <%cade_calrayn> OH NO
[7:43:16] <jtsoppy137> monkaS
[7:43:17] <Estwilde> speedy boiz
[7:43:17] <%Ynkubus_> @badguy8312 its an archaic way to spell it
[7:43:21] <%Valdorick> This guy is immune to bleed, poison, and rot
[7:43:21] <Hunk_Of_Dunk> Oh that looks like more than just a black flame
[7:43:22] <+Fenrisulfr_V> This boss is a pain.
[7:43:22] <%MaybeFalco> yeah hes fuckin chunky too
[7:43:22] <+TheBitingIrish> Oh damn LUL
[7:43:23] <%MisterRockett> Wow that backstab did nothing.
[7:43:26] <@Spydurman> oh
[7:43:28] <%vance168> oh he is for real
[7:43:30] <+BeatBoxersDevMike> when does that wind become a thing?
[7:43:33] <penitentpendant> WAY too quick
[7:43:33] <NaderShahDidNothingWrong> Black knife, so the imprisoned were who assassinated the demigod?
[7:43:34] <+CatRidder> no casting
[7:43:34] <ohno58> is the music supposed to sound like that?
[7:43:37] <rudiciuscaesar> try the rot dagger, see how long it takes to build
[7:43:38] <+hoenhime344> no stikiny breath i guess
[7:43:38] <+chaggles> shes super tough
[7:43:38] <%strakillias> That's your backstab damage. This dude is HUGE
[7:43:39] <Guardiansaiyan> @PatStaresAt FFXIV letter 6 hours
[7:43:39] <Vermillion129> big hp on this man
[7:43:41] <%X2Eliah> OK that is BS, a knife user should not have that much health
[7:43:41] <stickandstonefruit> rot dagger?
[7:43:41] <luciluxlu0> the crucible tackle can cheese this fight
[7:43:42] <%Valdorick> This fucko wants +25 weapons
[7:43:42] <rudiciuscaesar> you're totally fast enough
[7:43:43] <badguy8312> this man is hitting you with demon slayer bullshit
[7:43:46] <tolloponik> Beyblade through your breath
[7:43:47] <%notsoy> time for greg
[7:43:53] <%SveriSageAdvice> i still havent beat this dude because he has an instant kill grab, it's so damn hard lol
[7:43:54] <%whyskeywolfe> Why not
[7:43:55] <+Pendragwn> you will be and we all know it
[7:43:55] <tanarath> Yes, because this boss is hard fucked
[7:43:58] <%X2Eliah> not even for ff14?
[7:43:59] <$realm_forge> GREEEEG UH
[7:44:04] <%Valdorick> @rudiciuscaesar It takes for ever, he's literally immune to rot
[7:44:06] <%strakillias> Just keep playing elden ring till the live letter /s
[7:44:11] <%cade_calrayn> oh we've named the Mimic Tear Greg?
[7:44:18] <%JustTheGuyYouNeed> This guy drops the best ghost
[7:44:23] <@QueequegTheater> Greg is wanted in all 6 states
[7:44:27] <%Valdorick> His does way worse than bleed
[7:44:30] <rudiciuscaesar> @Valdorick awww for real? That SUCKS
[7:44:30] <+hoenhime344> he dont like blackfdire
[7:44:30] <Hunk_Of_Dunk> It's not like you really miss anything by just sleeping until it goes
[7:44:40] <+Fenrisulfr_V> His reduces MAX health and burns.
[7:44:45] <SubjectX07x> Honestly mimic tear is always best ghost imo
[7:44:47] <+AyupaPupa> mimic kun
[7:44:47] <%pabloelenano2> thats a coll atack
[7:44:52] <%pabloelenano2> cool*
[7:44:54] <Wakerz140> There's a bunch of really strong ghosts
[7:44:58] <Kaito_Cam> oh this dude
[7:45:04] <%X2Eliah> BTW Pat why did you stop dual-weilding?
[7:45:04] <+hoenhime344> mimic HAS to the best
[7:45:06] <Kaito_Cam> I said fuck this dude when I first fough him
[7:45:10] <Guardiansaiyan> @PatStaresAt keep playing elden ring till the live letter
[7:45:12] <%MaybeFalco> this is 100% a come back later thing
[7:45:13] <tanarath> This is to go even further beyond, Pat. Even GrEgg can be surprassed.
[7:45:14] <p_e_a_x> the bird is really good too
[7:45:16] <%Valdorick> Put a marker on this fucker and come back later
[7:45:18] <Vermillion129> mimic and this guy ash spirit ash is really storng
[7:45:19] <+hoenhime344> also blackfire always staggters
[7:45:21] <+hoenhime344> him
[7:45:21] <zenith0111> What about the Eagle that gives buffs
[7:45:22] <+Nomenanza> you can defintely beat his ass. He staggers all the time from UGS
[7:45:23] <+hoenhime344> yes you can
[7:45:24] <khaenriahns> him floaty boi.
[7:45:25] <Happydisaster> It’s all good
[7:45:28] <+Fenrisulfr_V> Man, as someone that either dual-wielded or powerstanced a twinblade for 90% of my playthrough, this boss blew my back out.
[7:45:28] <%MaybeFalco> i haven't even beat him yet, its stupid hard
[7:45:30] <MusouMiko> I don't even know how Pat got _up_ there
[7:45:31] <luciluxlu0> cheese him with the crucible tackle
[7:45:33] <Kaito_Cam> I was like level 100 when I fought him and he kicked my shit in.
[7:45:33] <$realm_forge> Alakastab
[7:45:35] <KasiCrafter> Do you think it's time to revisit the Crystalians?
[7:45:37] <tolloponik> I would like that weapon but with how much damage everything dose
[7:45:39] <+swesterly> is the music warped for anyone else?
[7:45:40] <djblue_shift> i'm surprised he doesn't inflict deathrot, the weapon effects look like it should
[7:45:41] <%vance168> thankfully with evergaols you can recover runes in safety lol
[7:45:44] <%genepark> I have also not beaten him lol
[7:45:45] <Guerrillasaurus> big stagger to make up for it tho
[7:45:47] <Estwilde> Now-Pat tags in Future-Pat for this
[7:45:49] <%X2Eliah> no, music is fine
[7:45:49] <%SveriSageAdvice> @MusouMiko just do Ranni's questline, it will bring you here
[7:45:50] <JRenz888> mimic is probably better due to copying broken builds but this drops my favorite
[7:45:51] <%genepark> I still need to clear this area
[7:45:53] <%Puhff> good luck. watched Vel fight this dude for like 2 hours
[7:45:54] <%X2Eliah> reload twitch if audio warped
[7:46:00] <%X2Eliah> its a desync thing
[7:46:01] <badguy8312> Bethesda???
[7:46:04] <MusouMiko> ah figures
[7:46:05] <Kaito_Cam> He's a meanie bo beanie
[7:46:05] <+AyupaPupa> whee
[7:46:07] <tanarath> Vel slammed his head against this boss's wall for literal hours, it was nuts
[7:46:15] <MusouMiko> I've started it on my caster so matter of time
[7:46:15] <%SveriSageAdvice> that is for a puzzle later @PatStaresAt its bullshit
[7:46:20] <Hunk_Of_Dunk> So that's not the black flame, because it's red. It's not regular fire, because it seems to last unike normally. It's not scarlet rot or bleed, since it doesn't cause a status effect. What the fuck is that guy doing?
[7:46:37] <%X2Eliah> Is it for a final fantasy flying ship thing? (dont asnwer)
[7:46:40] <%Valdorick> @JRenz888 The problem is if you don't have a build based around using mimic tear, mimic tear is just bad.
[7:46:41] <SubjectX07x> @Hunk_Of_Dunk What he's doing.. is kinda spoilers.
[7:46:41] <%RealThiele> i just spent like 8 hours playing elden ring and went from 16% progress to a whopping 16% progress wtf
[7:46:41] <%Kevlar_Caviar> @Hunk_Of_Dunk it's bullshit that's what it is
[7:46:44] <Kaito_Cam> a dragon that's not worth fighting
[7:46:54] <Hunk_Of_Dunk> Fair enough. It's cool, though.
[7:47:03] <MusouMiko> @Hunk_Of_Dunk just [redacted] things (but without the dot and hp cut)
[7:47:03] <%JustTheGuyYouNeed> @Hunk_Of_Dunk He is throwing death
[7:47:14] <+Fenrisulfr_V> I think it's interesting, as it reduces Pat's max HP instead of anything else.
[7:47:15] <rudiciuscaesar> fought a Great Old One or whatever
[7:47:15] <pi_in_the_sci> passed a grace
[7:47:15] <badguy8312> cry me a river Kratos
[7:47:17] <%BinaryFireball> yea but hot witch waifu
[7:47:20] <%Kevlar_Caviar> you had to kill a space dragonfly
[7:47:20] <%Valdorick> Strictly speaking, you went through 3.
[7:47:23] <%pabloelenano2> and probably to space at this rate
[7:47:24] <+swesterly> @RealThiele where are you getting this percentage form?
[7:47:24] <Kaito_Cam> Had to wade through a river of pink pepto
[7:47:26] <%dekkitout> Went through Ptumeru AND Izalith
[7:47:26] <+CatRidder> and kill the naturalborne
[7:47:29] <%Monkeyweed21> this is the equivalent of seeing the abyss or the ash lake on the map but it just looks like a normal area
[7:47:33] <Vermillion129> you even have to kill the thing that destroyed those city
[7:47:34] <Guardiansaiyan> next: Amarout Elden Ring Edition
[7:47:37] <%MartinOfLoxley> And your wife killed a 3 fingers
[7:47:40] <%cade_calrayn> these things SUCK
[7:47:48] <Kaito_Cam> oh fuck that thing
[7:47:50] <+BeatBoxersDevMike> [FRENZY!]
[7:47:51] <%genepark> You walked into a hole made from the comet that dropped after you killed a guy lol
[7:47:52] <%RealThiele> @RealThiele PS acheievement progress so im not super surprised it didnt move but damn
[7:47:52] <+AyupaPupa> why do godrick's people care about the moon
[7:48:02] <rudiciuscaesar> was that Legarius's skull wailing sound?
[7:48:06] <CingKanada> When you were in the church earlier and it said "Touch Grace" I thought it said "Touch Grass" lol
[7:48:15] <tanarath> creepy49Porpkek creepy49Porpkek creepy49Porpkek creepy49Porpkek creepy49Porpkek
[7:48:17] <Kaito_Cam> that's some BULLSHIT!
[7:48:23] <%tetraes> @PatStaresAt  yeah but who cares got maidens
[7:48:23] <%Valdorick> Max FP up?
[7:48:27] <tanarath> Such fucking bs
[7:48:49] <%Puhff> wtf are they doing here????
[7:48:50] <%SveriSageAdvice> oh that grafted drops a skill, but i dont remember which one
[7:48:52] <+Pendragwn> @AyupaPupa they just think it's neat
[7:48:54] <%X2Eliah> yeah this is oddly empty
[7:49:01] <%MaybeFalco> its the exit from the ranni hhole
[7:49:03] <+Fenrisulfr_V> Those Revenants are just the worst.
[7:49:07] <Kaito_Cam> They need to go touch grace
[7:49:08] <%X2Eliah> that looks like a way out from somewhere
[7:49:09] <rudiciuscaesar> an exit to something?
[7:49:10] <+CatRidder> the exit
[7:49:15] <ape_hawk> its a hole

[8:00:26] <+TheBitingIrish> Does the rebirth let you change looks or just redivvy stats?
[8:00:29] <%dekkitout> Little red took no shit from the wolf I see
[8:00:30] <@QueequegTheater> @Valdorick *Guts
[8:00:38] <SubjectX07x> His armor is easily the coolest there is.
[8:00:39] <+Fenrisulfr_V> @crimsonomen0 The mask is just sitting on the wall at Seluvis' Rise.
[8:00:39] <%SveriSageAdvice> @tanarath theyre actually red from a different quest that overrode it
[8:00:43] <%watts121> god I love that cloak
[8:00:45] <Sigma_190_Beta> @TheBitingIrish You can change looks as you want.
[8:00:46] <sirrice77> @TheBitingIrish theres a cosmetic change yeah
[8:00:46] <rudiciuscaesar> the cape really obscures your feet though
[8:00:50] <%tetraes> Crackling with sexual energy
[8:00:53] <%Valdorick> @Valdorick six in one hand, half a dozen in the other
[8:00:55] <+tizziks> think there is more at the top of her  tower
[8:00:55] <penitentpendant> @TheBitingIrish Rebirth changes stats, you can change looks for free from a mirror in the hub
[8:00:57] <SubjectX07x> You don't have to let him out for this.
[8:00:58] <$realm_forge> Pat has unlocked furry mode
[8:01:01] <rosabellamelantha> @PatStaresAt new grace upstairs with new dialogue
[8:01:03] <+LandOfTheWay> check the grace upstairs
[8:01:04] <+ScrapKingKeita> sup Guts
[8:01:05] <%TurtlesAndTentacles> Nah man look bad without coat
[8:01:06] <%greasypete00> looks cooler with it
[8:01:06] <+Edrem> go all the way up to top of tower for more ranni
[8:01:07] <Sigma_190_Beta> I like the coat though.
[8:01:08] <%whyskeywolfe> Eh.
[8:01:09] <%luftraumm1> i like coa
[8:01:10] <tanarath> @sverisageadvice oh! my bad.
[8:01:11] <%watts121> can't believe you cucked the werewolf...this is the best game
[8:01:15] <haisho> looks kinda naked...which I realize doesn't make sense
[8:01:17] <Maids4lyfe> the coat is better
[8:01:18] <+SuperNoriri> it's a little bare at the back without the coat
[8:01:20] <Sgt_Wigglytuff> Cape is way better
[8:01:21] <+Fenrisulfr_V> Head to the top of the tower if you want a bit of lore, iirc.
[8:01:23] <+BeatBoxersDevMike> isnt there a dog knight helm that'd fully complete the guts set?
[8:01:23] <Sol_Install> it looks weird
[8:01:23] <+crimsonomen0> @fenrisulfr_v oh yeah? Damn I know what I’m grabbing when I play tomorrow haha.
[8:01:24] <%SveriSageAdvice> np @tanarath
[8:01:28] <rudiciuscaesar> now summon the mimic to make yet another replacement Blaidd lol
[8:01:34] <Sol_Install> much better
[8:01:34] <Guardiansaiyan> @PatStaresAt put a raccoon tail on your belt in the back
[8:01:38] <Guardiansaiyan> lol
[8:01:56] <Guardiansaiyan> HahaBall
[8:02:06] <%luftraumm1> godslayer is cooler
[8:02:08] <%BonewheelVanguard> @PatStaresAt Its like you murdered your friend after steeling his waifu, stole his cloths and are now wearing his skinned head as your own.
[8:02:10] <%dekkitout> Is this that powerstancing thing the kids are on about
[8:02:11] <rudiciuscaesar> those are just greatswords right, not ultra greatswords?
[8:02:13] <+crimsonomen0> Why Blaidd gotta die? He was a cool guy 😢
[8:02:36] <%RealThiele> Blaidd died cause his waifu went to space
[8:02:41] <%X2Eliah> @crimsonomen0 that feels like a grrm thing.
[8:02:43] <rudiciuscaesar> yeah, with that speed and range, thought so.
[8:02:49] <tolloponik> 3 end?
[8:02:55] <%watts121> we switching to a quality build?
[8:02:55] <rudiciuscaesar> idk, is that really better than the faith spiral sword thing?
[8:03:07] <CingKanada> Finally using that arithmetic, huh Pat?
[8:03:09] <%sporeian94> about 2 more
[8:03:10] <%Valdorick> I mean, Blaidd was part of Ranni anyway, so its more like you just killed any chance at an 8 armed furry threesome
[8:03:10] <%RealThiele> Fierce deity sword is pretty cool
[8:03:19] <%Kevlar_Caviar> just a few more points into end, right?
[8:03:20] <%X2Eliah> MATH SOULS
[8:03:26] <+crimsonomen0> Are there a limited amount of larval tears?
[8:03:35] <+hoenhime344> lol remember when they said you wont have a calculator with you all the time?
[8:03:37] <rudiciuscaesar> aw man, that blade's got gunk on it lol
[8:03:52] <%X2Eliah> Wait but seriously, is it ultimately a better choice to sword-and-board or dual-wield?
[8:03:52] <%Valdorick> I think Larval Tears are a rare farmable mat in the ancient city? Don't quote me on that though.
[8:04:05] <+Fenrisulfr_V> @crimsonomen0 You can farm them in Nokron.
[8:04:09] <+BeatBoxersDevMike> wow, i didnt know they made a new berserk game in 2022
[8:04:09] <NewWillinium> You look so cool
[8:04:09] <+crimsonomen0> Or can you just respec forever?
[8:04:11] <%sniffy77> Pat I swear the more you put into vigor the larger the hp increase
[8:04:14] <luciluxlu0> talk to iji as well since you killed blaidd
[8:04:28] <+LandOfTheWay> big lore time
[8:04:28] <%RealThiele> i mean parts of this game are just a love letter to berserk
[8:04:31] <TheBlankAce> Pocket wife
[8:04:41] <+crimsonomen0> @fenrisulfr_v aight cool. Not there yet. Thanks.
[8:04:41] <%Monkeyweed21> @hoenhime344 you need to learn cursive for the purposes of college papers
[8:05:00] <+Fenrisulfr_V> @X2Eliah Probably sword-and-board. As someone that exclusively dual-wielded swords or two-handed a twinblade, there were several times where I would get fucked for not having a shield equipped.
[8:05:09] <%DashXero> She sounds nuts.
[8:05:10] <+ScrapKingKeita> Reverse instrumentality
[8:05:13] <%watts121> Means she wants to remove magic from the world.
[8:05:15] <%whyskeywolfe> Wait, is Ranni crazy?
[8:05:15] <%Valdorick> She wants to introduce mortality to the world and let man take hold of their own lives.
[8:05:16] <Ghufufin> shes gonna fuk off into space
[8:05:17] <NBUsagi> It sounds like she just wants to fuck off into the stars
[8:05:17] <%X2Eliah> @X2Eliah gotcha... thanks!
[8:05:19] <penitentpendant> Waifu: "Let's go to SPAAAAACE!"
[8:05:19] <%justcallmebobplease> DO YOU WANT TO GO TO SPACE AND TRANSCEND YOUR LIMITS
[8:05:22] <%sporeian94> VAATI PLEASE EXPLAIN
[8:05:24] <CaptainBright> It's Char's principle of Newtypes
[8:05:24] <Zourath> Abandon earth, go to spess
[8:05:24] <%pabloelenano2> snhe is going to start her own world
[8:05:28] <%vance168> Sounds like acending into pure energy
[8:05:29] <+tizziks> Cognitive Realm
[8:05:31] <pi_in_the_sci> She wants the divine to stop fucking with common folk
[8:05:32] <%X2Eliah> She wants to star tre
[8:05:35] <+croutonian> FUCK EARTH, GO TO SPACE
[8:05:37] <%pabloelenano2> and erase this one...?
[8:05:37] <%TurtlesAndTentacles> Prequel to Dark Soul? lol
[8:05:40] <luciluxlu0> don't care. she's hot
[8:05:40] <%Monkeyweed21> FUCK THE EARTH AND THE TREE LETS FLY IN THE STARS
[8:05:42] <nyarlateel> PAT RICK AR U GOOD WIHT SENILE CIRCLE
[8:05:42] <%RealThiele> she found armored core in space
[8:05:44] <XxMoliciousxX> we're going to mars?
[8:05:46] <+eanscrale> Your souls will not be held down by gravity.
[8:05:51] <Sigma_190_Beta> @PatStaresAt She's going to introduce mortality to everyone.
[8:05:53] <Hunk_Of_Dunk> sounds like age of man, basically? plus fucking off
[8:05:53] <Ghufufin> free your soul from gravity
[8:05:53] <SubjectX07x> Sounds like she basically wants the divines to stop fucking with peoples lives and for mankind to live as we do in the real world...
[8:05:57] <CaptainBright> Gravity is what tethers people's souls to Earth
[8:05:59] <%Valdorick> The Fingers are basically fucking everyone over, and she hates it, so wants to do the opposite of that.
[8:06:02] <%watts121> now if only it did Rot.
[8:06:03] <$realm_forge> She wants to found Zeon
[8:06:03] <%BonewheelVanguard> go to space and stop being a person, no emotion, no feeling.
[8:06:05] <ape_hawk> your sword farted
[8:06:09] <%dekkitout> Might as well put the shroom hat on and become shroom wolf
[8:06:10] <rosabellamelantha> @SubjectX07x that is explicitely what she wants
[8:06:11] <$0ddeye> Fuck the land between and all the bullshit in it, people gonna be mortal and lonely and cold but its better that way
[8:06:15] <+Rellim80> The one place untouched by Capitalism...SPACE
[8:06:15] <+BeatBoxersDevMike> "I wish to create a world with Metal Wolves and Chaos"
[8:06:15] <%DashXero> Ranni sounds like she's asking you to drink Kool-Aid.
[8:06:16] <%X2Eliah> so basically, this game again is KILL GODS
[8:06:22] <Gray_LoFi> Is there any way to set up so you have bleed, poison, and rot
[8:06:27] <rosabellamelantha> @BonewheelVanguard Nah it's more "FUCK GODS"
[8:06:34] <XxMoliciousxX> we're going to be a spacefaring astartes chapter?
[8:06:36] <penitentpendant> Get bigger so you can wield them all?
[8:06:44] <rosabellamelantha> yes
[8:06:52] <rosabellamelantha> and patron will be the god emperor
[8:06:55] <rosabellamelantha> with his star wife
[8:06:56] <TheBlankAce> Its probably better to just keep to big faith just to finish testing out the stat
[8:07:06] <%Valdorick> Remember too, all this trouble started when a Demigod ate shit super hard when they weren't suppose to.
[8:07:11] <+LandOfTheWay> @patstaresat the Golden Order connects everyone to the Erdtree, down to their souls. ranni wants to keep everyone's souls separate, both from her new Order and from each other
[8:07:12] <%X2Eliah> oh wow people really are using that jellyfish shield, huh
[8:07:16] <+crimsonomen0> So pats played this game for 90 hours and is like what, halfway done?
[8:07:24] <+Kavtech> Has Pat beaten the Shardbearer of Caelid yet?
[8:07:27] <Sigma_190_Beta> @PatStaresAt Basically Ranni wants to tell the fingers to eff off, and also make it so that everyone is mortal again.
[8:07:27] <%Valdorick> Even under the BEST planned version of gods walking the earth, one person like you can fuck it up for everyone.
[8:07:33] <$SGrim> @PatStaresAt how much longer do you think you'll go tonight? I'm getting sleepy and want to know if I should make some coffee.
[8:07:44] <%X2Eliah> it feels like pat is more than halfway done
[8:08:08] <tanarath> Btw, does any of this solve the scarlet rot?
[8:08:11] <%RealThiele> DOOT
[8:08:34] <+eanscrale> damn that greatshield guy still doesn't quit
[8:08:34] <%RealThiele> Ranni will just freeze the rot idk
[8:08:37] <rosabellamelantha> @tanarath the scarlet rot is excplicitely caused by a god so yes the age of stars would solve it
[8:08:39] <%watts121> I love how we all use this camp to test stuff out. These guys get fucked in everyones playthroughs.
[8:08:44] <+LandOfTheWay> as far as big quests to do, i think this just leaves fia, millicent, and alexander, since hyetta is bugged
[8:08:45] <AnnoyedApricot> cool
[8:08:47] <+Fenrisulfr_V> That seems pretty decent for being unupgraded.
[8:08:48] <%X2Eliah> the shield looks weird
[8:08:48] <%DashXero> Eh.....
[8:08:49] <Ghufufin> its a cool skill
[8:08:52] <%X2Eliah> like aesthetically
[8:08:52] <ape_hawk> nah
[8:08:53] <%Valdorick> If the Scarlet Rot is a symptom of the Erd Tree rotting, then Ranni making the Order leave the planet would include the Erd Tree
[8:08:53] <%pabloelenano2> i liked more the godslayer
[8:08:54] <%X2Eliah> it doesnt fit
[8:08:56] <%dekkitout> Preferred mushroomancer
[8:08:57] <%JustTheGuyYouNeed> I think the special move also lower the maximum health of enemies
[8:09:03] <+eanscrale> they're low lever and easy to test stuff on
[8:09:06] <%RealThiele> it did like 9 points of ticking dmg meh
[8:09:08] <+BeatBoxersDevMike> idk, it seems like the things from space are fine with the rot
[8:09:15] <tanarath> Oh shit, fuck gods then
[8:09:22] <Happydisaster> Now dual wield greatswords
[8:09:24] <$thomassolorio> guts would 2 hand
[8:09:25] <APsaull> apparently weather effects certain spell potency
[8:09:25] <%Valdorick> Now, how does Greg handle dual wielding?
[8:09:30] <Ghufufin> lol
[8:09:34] <%dekkitout> Easy there, Pong Krell
[8:09:36] <Ghufufin> dual dualblades
[8:09:44] <Sol_Install> OH
[8:09:47] <dereksbales> looks sick mate
[8:09:48] <CingKanada> Darth Maul would like to know your location
[8:09:49] <+AyupaPupa> so many blades
[8:09:52] <Sol_Install> this what max wants to run with
[8:09:57] <rosabellamelantha> Ranni's plan is like objectively super good for humanity and the planet but it involved fucking a LOT of shit up to get there
[8:09:58] <$SGrim> Call this shit the rotor build
[8:10:00] <MidnightPacif1c> blender
[8:10:01] <%strakillias> great pun
[8:10:06] <%Valdorick> Is there a way to have armor with swords on it
[8:10:09] <+BeatBoxersDevMike> if you enflame a the dual blades, they turn into lightsabers
[8:10:12] <DestroPrime83> fuck it im going to bed im so tired
[8:10:13] <%dekkitout> @SGrim The osprey
[8:10:13] <%pabloelenano2> man just looking at you cuted my finger tip
[8:10:14] <%Valdorick> Or Bismuth Armor?
[8:10:14] <%BonewheelVanguard> @PatStaresAt You look like a Final Fantasy Boss
[8:10:15] <%luftraumm1> twinblades are so stupid LUL
[8:10:20] <%watts121> There is a twinblade in the game that looks like maul's lightsaber, forgot where it was tho
[8:10:28] <%watts121> it was a bleed one so it's prob really good
[8:10:28] <+crimsonomen0> Pong Krell can suck a dick. All my homies hate Pong Krell.
[8:10:28] <%X2Eliah> Its gonna work as long as it keeps staggering
[8:10:33] <+Fenrisulfr_V> My Bloodflame Twinblade shit all over Radahn.
[8:10:37] <+LandOfTheWay> @valdorick considering malenia is the source of the rot, and the needle designed to remove it expressly says it keeps the influence of outer gods at bay, i think the rot is itself a deific force like the Greater Will and the Formless Mother
[8:10:41] <%dekkitout> @crimsonomen0 💯
[8:10:43] <%X2Eliah> I mean I think
[8:10:46] <%X2Eliah> I dont know for sure
[8:10:56] <%notsoy> this looks like a lamer version of warcraft demon hunters
[8:11:03] <Sol_Install> the jump attack cool with dual twini blades
[8:11:13] <dereksbales> looks like your form Inuyasha
[8:11:18] <dereksbales> from
[8:11:22] <%watts121> I went full Dex build after getting that Spear that shoots red lightning in the Capital City.
[8:11:23] <%dekkitout> Wus dat smel?
[8:11:27] <%JustTheGuyYouNeed> You can duplicate ashes
[8:11:29] <@QueequegTheater> @notsoy Not everything can be as cool as warglaives
[8:11:32] <%pabloelenano2> you need to duplicate the ash of war
[8:11:34] <CingKanada> @crimsonomen0 r/pongkrellhate
[8:11:39] <%RealThiele> copy ashes?
[8:11:39] <%watts121> The animation makes me feel like literal zeus
[8:11:40] <%Dakuu75> have an ashe duplication? you can make 2 blood
[8:11:45] <%X2Eliah> Surely there has to be a rot ashes of war somewhere
[8:11:46] <Happydisaster> Greatsword and those dualbladss
[8:11:53] <+BeatBoxersDevMike> the needle is to remove the effects of the frenzy tho
[8:12:18] <+crimsonomen0> @cingkanada you live like a bitch you die like a bitch.
[8:12:21] <%pabloelenano2> fuck you... thats so strong
[8:12:22] <+eanscrale> ! STATUS!
[8:12:27] <+Fenrisulfr_V> @BeatBoxersDevMike The Frenzy is from an outer god.
[8:12:31] <SubjectX07x> Bleed is VERY strong in this game.
[8:12:42] <$thomassolorio> ug grade dat shit
[8:12:44] <%X2Eliah> Yeah it seems stacking effects is the way to go, huh
[8:12:46] <+eanscrale> all the status effects, ALL OF THEM
[8:12:51] <Ghufufin> twinblades normally have a big spin attack if u hold r2
[8:12:53] <%RealThiele> just add rot and melt things into goo
[8:12:56] <+LandOfTheWay> @beatboxersdevmike it works on the frenzied flame, but the item description for both versions of the needle say it was made to target the rot
[8:12:59] <%X2Eliah> bigger bleed stack
[8:13:01] <%X2Eliah> thats all
[8:13:02] <%JustTheGuyYouNeed> it goes higher
[8:13:04] <%DashXero> Should double the bleed....?
[8:13:06] <voodoolawyer> Pat, Using His Own Fears, Combines the Powers of Pestilence and the Body's Juices to Create the Weapon
[8:13:07] <SubjectX07x> Blood slash only goes on swords.
[8:13:11] <+BeatBoxersDevMike> ah
[8:13:17] <voodoolawyer> This is like using a dirty syringe as a weapon
[8:13:17] <$thomassolorio> put bleeed on other
[8:13:21] <nesbitt22> You Bleed it out
[8:13:22] <FeralFozzie> I heard you like bleed. so we put bleed on the bleed so it can bleed while it bleeds
[8:13:23] <rudiciuscaesar> yeah, it's getting late. Thanks for streaming late Pat, gave me something to do as I lay up sick in bed. Night everyone.
[8:13:24] <+hoenhime344> i think all the status are very strong. but bleed is immediate
[8:13:30] <Happydisaster> @patstaresat use the dual blade with the gargoyle blacksword
[8:13:34] <+wizard_of_diamonds> Adding Bleed to a Natural Bleed does extra Bleed
[8:13:35] <NaberiustheNefarious> poison boosting strength and dex is busted
[8:13:47] <voodoolawyer> Attack of titan
[8:13:48] <@QueequegTheater> @PatStaresAt There is a whetstone that unlocks bleed on all weapons
[8:13:49] <+Fenrisulfr_V> @PatStaresAt You could always buff it with Bloodflame, right?
[8:13:54] <%watts121> @LandOfTheWay maybe because the needle is purified by Melenia's flower it's able to do other stuff?
[8:13:56] <%dekkitout> Sir, that is a very rude composition
[8:13:57] <%RealThiele> poison cast feels a bit slow
[8:14:07] <%Valdorick> I believe, and don't quote me on this, that putting bleed on an already bleed weapon just increases the status built up
[8:14:10] <%justcallmebobplease> HAH, slapped his friend in the face with a backhand!
[8:14:12] <%Valdorick> build*
[8:14:20] <@QueequegTheater> @Valdorick correct
[8:14:21] <$thomassolorio> meh
[8:14:25] <%X2Eliah> @Valdorick correct
[8:14:33] <%dekkitout> How's that rot knife
[8:14:39] <%watts121> If you can find a weapon art that does rot, then you'll hav ea stew going
[8:14:43] <%RealThiele> the poison buildup happens fast tho
[8:14:45] <$thomassolorio> ugh toll butt hole
[8:14:48] <%luftraumm1> @PatStaresAt try the rot knife +_ bleed knife
[8:14:50] <tri3dgE027> anyone else hearign weird hit-sfx?  Kinda sounds 16-bit at times rooThink
[8:14:59] <+hoenhime344> loot at the smile on this mans face
[8:15:00] <%dekkitout> Add some battery acid to the wound or whatev the saying is
[8:15:03] <%X2Eliah> Knifes have short range tho
[8:15:03] <+hoenhime344> look
[8:15:04] <Sgt_Wigglytuff> Poison, rot and bleed
[8:15:09] <%BonewheelVanguard> oh god
[8:15:11] <Ghufufin> is it  a rot knife or just a used toe knife?
[8:15:14] <%BonewheelVanguard> oh fuck
[8:15:29] <+LandOfTheWay> @watts121 it's possible, but considering both versions of the needle say they remove the influence of outer gods, i think the frenzied flame and rot have to qualify as such
[8:15:30] <%Valdorick> @tri3dgE027 Pause and unpause the stream, sounds like twitch hicupped and is trying to catch you up in their strange, awful way
[8:15:46] <%Monkeyweed21> This is just a DB build now
[8:15:50] <+Fenrisulfr_V> Look at all of those multi-hits.
[8:15:54] <+Fenrisulfr_V> *chef's kiss*
[8:15:54] <p_e_a_x> @PatStaresAt have you gotten and tried the sleep sword?
[8:16:01] <+LandOfTheWay> we know that outer gods other than the Greater Will exist, cause Mohg and his associated items talk about the Formless Mother as one
[8:16:14] <dereksbales> twin blade better
[8:16:15] <Gamer76255> There's  a scarlet rot dog ash if you wanna add more status chance
[8:16:21] <%luftraumm1> whats rotknife weapon art
[8:16:22] <%RealThiele> rot buildup is a bit slow
[8:16:29] <%Ixiah> so is bleed the meta damage type ?
[8:16:36] <%dekkitout> It's for the best that it's short range
[8:16:37] <%Valdorick> You should already have it, I think?
[8:16:38] <%pabloelenano2> @Gamer76255  where?
[8:16:40] <%watts121> I need to find the Bloodhound weapon art so I can put it on all the daggers. They need it so much.
[8:16:41] <tri3dgE027> @Valdorick yeah it disappeared just now, thought it was only in my end
[8:16:46] <+Fenrisulfr_V> @Ixiah That and Frost, yeah.
[8:16:51] <Hunk_Of_Dunk> I think he means a summon ash?
[8:16:52] <+HaloIsA> um a little off topic but my ER updated and rolled back like 10 hours of progress for me, does anyone have a fix?
[8:16:58] <%greasypete00> Patron the Poisoner Cleric
[8:17:02] <Gamer76255> The rot lake in caelid
[8:17:06] <%Valdorick> Or you might have the Rot Zombies, come to think of it
[8:17:08] <Minorou> yeah, the plague dog
[8:17:10] <+crimsonomen0> People in here debating elder gods and scarlet rot needle lore and I’m like “lol I punched a dragon”
[8:17:23] <%X2Eliah> @HaloIsA not really, if the save files got rolled back, they got rolled back
[8:17:32] <%Monkeyweed21> @HaloIsA did you click for the local save or cloud save
[8:17:36] <%DashXero> @crimsonomen0 You punch dragons too?! Sweet!
[8:17:41] <Hunk_Of_Dunk> I don't know if there's a rot weapon ash, just ones on unique weapons?
[8:17:41] <bassoontyphoon> Oh shit can you summon [Flaccid Pancake] yet?
[8:17:41] <+Ravenian96> @HaloIsA yeah I had to beat the game again after the update
[8:17:43] <+eanscrale> they said faith, they didn't say anything about being holy persay
[8:18:03] <NaberiustheNefarious> what would you guys say is the best ash of war for the scythe?
[8:18:09] <+grapplingwithdepression> Holy moses i just popped in here and the map size is so much more than i thought it was
[8:18:11] <+LandOfTheWay> @crimsonomen0 consider: if we can figure out the cosmos and their lore, we can punch them too
[8:18:13] <TheBlankAce> Did you ever check out what Astel's soul gives?
[8:18:22] <%RealThiele> rotten crystal sword is also a rot weapon
[8:18:25] <+Fenrisulfr_V> Wielding an off-hand Reduvia with a Bloody Slash primary Dagger is very spicy.
[8:18:33] <%Valdorick> It gives an Ash of Waaaaaaaar!
[8:18:45] <%tetraes> read lore?
[8:18:46] <timbob> what is that emblem on the top left by his health bar?
[8:18:56] <djblue_shift> the flail's weapon art is cool
[8:19:00] <sirrice77> it's his equipped great rune
[8:19:11] <+grapplingwithdepression> I made a faith flail and i feel real dumb for it but man
[8:19:12] <timbob> ohh gotcha
[8:19:16] <+Fenrisulfr_V> @RealThiele I'm actually dual-wielding that with the regular Crystal Sword on my Spellblade, currently.
[8:19:29] <+grapplingwithdepression> i love the cliche saltzpyre type witch hunter
[8:19:33] <%luftraumm1> why?
[8:19:35] <$realm_forge> I saw someone doing bloodbourne style teleport doges earlier
[8:19:36] <%pabloelenano2> @PatStaresAt  how about creating the mimic with the 2 dagers and then swap to your main weapons?
[8:19:43] <%X2Eliah> They do match
[8:19:50] <%luftraumm1> oh cool
[8:19:52] <%dekkitout> One blade of molasses and one blade of honey
[8:19:59] <TheBlankAce> You got a shitton of respec items go ahead
[8:20:12] <tri3dgE027> fashion souls is a go
[8:20:21] <+hoenhime344> try dule wheilding sheilds
[8:20:25] <Happydisaster> @patstaresat what if gargoyle dual blades and gargoyle greatsword.
[8:20:32] <+SpiritRoads> you could get the upgraded arsenal talisman
[8:20:38] <krmudle> How many hours are we at pat?
[8:20:38] <+Fenrisulfr_V> Just ditch the shield.
[8:20:38] <+hoenhime344> 3hit guard break
[8:20:51] <+Fenrisulfr_V> Be aggressive.
[8:21:06] <%luftraumm1> what do yo have to do to get the arsenal +1?
[8:21:07] <%tetraes> did Pat ever beat those rot crytsals?
[8:21:46] <%X2Eliah> It sucks that its not a one hit kill
[8:21:47] <+Fenrisulfr_V> @PatStaresAt Dual wields have unique stealth L1s.
[8:21:49] <Happydisaster> Is power stance really that limited? Shame
[8:21:56] <%Valdorick> Seems kinda jank you're not one shotting them with the double swing. What's a single swing do for damage?
[8:21:59] <+hoenhime344> not cool enough
[8:22:17] <%X2Eliah> oh they are at +0
[8:22:19] <%X2Eliah> ok
[8:22:22] <%X2Eliah> then its good
[8:22:41] <NaberiustheNefarious> can you add greases to weapons after applying elemental affinities?
[8:22:51] <+Fenrisulfr_V> No.
[8:22:52] <%Valdorick> Huh, but you still only did 200 to that guy
[8:23:01] <%X2Eliah> not really
[8:23:02] <+Fenrisulfr_V> Stealth bonus
[8:23:05] <+TheBitingIrish> There's dualwield backstabs? @Fenrisulfr_V
[8:23:11] <%X2Eliah> Are these like shortswords?
[8:23:16] <%X2Eliah> their range still seems low
[8:23:24] <+Fenrisulfr_V> @TheBitingIrish No, unfortunately. They just have unique attack animations from stealth.
[8:23:26] <%Valdorick> They're Greatswords
[8:23:29] <+TheBitingIrish> o
[8:23:56] <+TheBitingIrish> I got excited for a second, thinking of double Misericorde backstabs
[8:23:59] <Ghufufin> spin to win
[8:24:00] <deviljhojho_> thats how i like it
[8:24:11] <+hoenhime344> dule bleed ro twinblade
[8:24:18] <+Fenrisulfr_V> Bleed is basically broken in this one.
[8:24:21] <%X2Eliah> hmmm
[8:24:23] <Devbob98> Pat’s still playing christ
[8:24:25] <+hoenhime344> my vite
[8:24:26] <+Edrem> if the weapon has arcane scaling, arcane boosts the bleed buildup
[8:24:30] <+hoenhime344> vote*
[8:24:31] <%pabloelenano2> yes
[8:24:33] <$thomassolorio> YES
[8:24:33] <Vermillion129> gotta love bleed in elden ring
[8:24:37] <+Stormzcales_Lair> i use dual bleed falcions atm
[8:24:45] <tri3dgE027> With the amount of organic enemies in Elden Ring, Bleeding really seem busted
[8:24:47] <+TheBitingIrish> Weight?
[8:24:49] <+TheBitingIrish> Oh
[8:24:51] <+hoenhime344> too  op
[8:24:56] <+hoenhime344> ah
[8:25:01] <%TalisKanju> Is Pat trying to finish Elden Ring tonight?
[8:25:08] <%RealThiele> buy some from giant lad?
[8:25:15] <penitentpendant> All the status effects!
[8:25:15] <%pabloelenano2> i like that idea
[8:25:33] <+crimsonomen0> Pat about to teach a class on farming upgrade materials? I’m here for it.
[8:25:38] <%dekkitout> Poison, rot, bleed. With these powers combined form Captain Septic Shock
[8:25:39] <+hoenhime344> has pat faugh rahdan?
[8:25:40] <Happydisaster> I feel like that can be a huge issue against certain enemies
[8:25:41] <%X2Eliah> Well you arent doing super hiogh STR or DEX, so you arent stacking huge physical damage. So bleed/Dot makes sense
[8:25:44] <%JustTheGuyYouNeed> @TalisKanju Only if he is going for a 40 hour stream
[8:25:52] <Ghufufin> pat if u love too many things  you can explode
[8:25:55] <Ghufufin> its science
[8:26:05] <%RealThiele> i found a physick mod that keeps souls on death im so excited
[8:26:08] <penitentpendant> I almost feel bad for the next MSQ boss Pat is going to step over.
[8:26:20] <%X2Eliah> @RealThiele yoooo
[8:26:29] <Ner234> @Ghufufin Explosions are cool tho
[8:26:32] <+eanscrale> Man this game is going to be played for like a decade huh?
[8:26:49] <%rosysyntax> @RealThiele WAT
[8:26:58] <+hoenhime344> omg that looks so cool
[8:26:58] <Ghufufin> @Ner234 i love explosions so its kind of a vicious cycle
[8:27:04] <+tizziks> Whatever happened to that dude looking for his servant?  Did Pat ever find her?
[8:27:07] <HyperionXV> Anyone know what level pat is at now?
[8:27:10] <%pabloelenano2> im going to try to convice pat to play coop again by sujesting testing on bosses
[8:27:17] <%X2Eliah> Oddly Elden Ring might be too big to have massive replayability. Like... can you imagine doing multiple full playthroughs of this?
[8:27:17] <Ner234> @eanscrale And then another decade after that when someone mods previous games into it.
[8:27:22] <+BeatBoxersDevMike> speaking of explosives, anyone in chat know how to throw the physick flask?
[8:27:24] <%X2Eliah> Just one is an ordeal
[8:27:45] <%X2Eliah> I dont think you can throw it
[8:28:04] <doughboidankweed> pat pat pat
[8:28:06] <%X2Eliah> maybe if you combine the explode with the shield, you can mitigate it on yourself
[8:28:08] <Happydisaster> You can kill these guys with two hits from the other greatsword though
[8:28:14] <+hoenhime344> probs when upgraded
[8:28:14] <Sigma_190_Beta> @BeatBoxersDevMike You don't throw it, you explode yourself over while drinking it.
[8:28:15] <+eanscrale> @Ner234 People are already replacing bosses with Thomas the Tank Engine.
[8:28:28] <+BeatBoxersDevMike> ah, tactical
[8:28:37] <+grapplingwithdepression> hey wait i never tune in to these is pat playing on pc or ps5 and also did he mention what his settings are at?
[8:28:38] <DracaenaLeaf> Nice
[8:28:41] <+wizard_of_diamonds> As is right and proper
[8:28:45] <%X2Eliah> that took awhile
[8:28:46] <+grapplingwithdepression> if pc i mean
[8:28:48] <doughboidankweed> how is the game. havent watched anything on it
[8:28:49] <Ner234> @eanscrale Ah, it's already begun I see. glorious.
[8:28:51] <+polothegreatest> LUL LUL
[8:28:52] <+wizard_of_diamonds> Thomas the Tank Engine, ultimate enemy of FromSoft
[8:28:54] <%dekkitout> All is well when Thomas is modded in already
[8:28:56] <+tizziks> Ps5 performance
[8:28:57] <jtsoppy137> Macho man mods plz Kappa
[8:28:59] <ammobasket> @grapplingwithdepression ps5

[8:29:38] <Guardiansaiyan> VirtualHug <3 HahaBall
[8:29:42] <+eanscrale> @Ner234 Somehow, it never gets old.
[8:29:49] <%pabloelenano2> Sadge i had hope
[8:29:54] <%Valdorick> @doughboidankweed Not even up the lift yet!
[8:29:59] <tri3dgE027> Doesn't the Twin Bell Maiden sell those normal shards?
[8:30:04] <%RealThiele> @RealThiele name is twiggy cracked tear
[8:30:04] <Happydisaster> @patstaresat the greatsword you originally use can kill these guys with two hits without relying on an effect, this seems like a downgrade to me
[8:30:05] <KasiCrafter> What's bad about them both being normal?
[8:30:14] <+hoenhime344> what about whips?
[8:30:24] <+BeatBoxersDevMike> bell maiden needs a bell you find
[8:30:24] <%X2Eliah> Whips dont do critical
[8:30:40] <%X2Eliah> and they dont have a native effect
[8:30:44] <Happydisaster> Oh yeah
[8:30:44] <%tetraes> @PatStaresAt if u want a bleed twinblade do the Yura quest

[8:38:04] <%X2Eliah> I was worried the game might be close to ending
[8:38:14] <r0flwaffles> wow pats gonna destroy the next 2 zones
[8:38:18] <sirrice77> theres also the capital and blood satans area
[8:38:21] <+BeatBoxersDevMike> the game keeps growing every time you look at it
[8:38:32] <%Valdorick> That's a big difference but it still doesn't seem like much.
[8:38:58] <Ner234> They really just put a Sekiro enemy with Sekiro speed in the game LUL
[8:39:00] <digaogrunge> TWO HAND IT
[8:39:12] <Ner234> Well not quite Sekiro speed
[8:39:18] <+grapplingwithdepression> yo is the elden ring soundtrack on spotify or anything yet?
[8:39:25] <crackhead000111> @ner234 one of those crow assholes LUL
[8:39:58] <+BeatBoxersDevMike> some boss attack patterns certainly feel like they expect sekiro parrying
[8:40:02] <RubberFistFight> @BeatBoxersDevMike The more you play with it, the bigger and harder it gets? Kappa
[8:40:03] <%X2Eliah> what

[8:40:16] <@QueequegTheater> LUL
[8:40:17] <Ghufufin> time to call Greg?
[8:40:19] <%luftraumm1> gonna be trivial

[8:43:13] <morkelebmink> the CHEESE IS REAL
[8:43:22] <morkelebmink> taste that CHEEEEESE MMMM
[8:43:23] <digaogrunge> black flame on stagger
[8:43:23] <%Valdorick> Your Weapon art seems stronger than going for the critical
[8:43:24] <@QueequegTheater> @PatStaresAt Instead of riposting, use the weapon art
[8:43:25] <KasiCrafter> Are you gonna flex on him by weapon arting him on riposte?
[8:43:27] <+eanscrale> oh the crouching attack
[8:43:30] <zamdemega> stun lock is real
[8:43:31] <%luftraumm1> oooo
[8:43:31] <MaesePC> @PatStaresAt nice choese!
[8:43:32] <+imthinkingdarbys> lmao
[8:43:32] <%pabloelenano2> surprise
[8:43:34] <crackhead000111> oof
[8:43:34] <$SGrim> RIP
[8:43:34] <%thebeargoesHONK> tempt fate...
[8:43:35] <Vermillion129> that is fucked up too LUL
[8:43:35] <morkelebmink> he WAITED
[8:43:36] <%Valdorick> Input = Read
[8:43:39] <tanarath> mortis
[8:43:39] <+StallionPupper> so is hat
[8:43:44] <%justcallmebobplease> He expressed his dislike of your cheese.
[8:43:45] <Ner234> He has cheese too LUL
[8:43:48] <%connorfromearth> absolutely downloaded
[8:43:51] <+BeatBoxersDevMike> at one point, jail/gaol may have even literally been spelled "gayhole"
[8:44:01] <+BeatBoxersDevMike> in etymology
[8:44:02] <zamdemega> can you really do this for the entire boss fight?
[8:44:03] <Strigiform> dodgey enemies are so bad at dodging rocks
[8:44:08] <LuminusVows> What isn't an one hit kill at this point in the game LUL
[8:44:19] <%X2Eliah> @zamdemega not infinitely, due to stamina
[8:44:22] <Strigiform> they dodge when you press the button, then eat 3 rocks to the face
[8:44:30] <zamdemega> i see
[8:44:47] <%soloshotfirst82> @BeatBoxersDevMike if tv and movies are to be believed, then it's lived up to its name.
[8:44:53] <%X2Eliah> mmmyeah he can dodge it tho
[8:45:13] <crackhead000111> lol
[8:45:36] <jtsoppy137> Judgment cut
[8:45:36] <crackhead000111> how tf do you duck that
[8:45:38] <+TheBitingIrish> This crypt I found is full out lightning and it's rocking my shit
[8:45:46] <+TheBitingIrish> full of*
[8:45:52] <tanarath> Can't block it
[8:46:08] <%Valdorick> Even if you block it, its a blackflame attack, so puts a dot on you, AND reduces your max hp for a minute!
[8:46:26] <%rosysyntax> jump attacks are your friend
[8:46:36] <%X2Eliah> yes
[8:46:40] <%X2Eliah> as long as they connect
[8:46:44] <%Valdorick> But the crouch is faster
[8:46:53] <+Edrem> The spirit from this boss requires 132 FP, but it's worth it
[8:46:55] <%AyotoCorp> The crouch R1 basically gets all the stamina it used back within the recovery animation though
[8:47:00] <%Valdorick> So yeah, open with poke, then go into r1
[8:47:31] <%pabloelenano2> stuck in the rock...sadge
[8:47:32] <djblue_shift> that was unfortunate
[8:47:41] <%shootbang_exe> but greg tho
[8:47:43] <timbob> Jackpot
[8:47:44] <%X2Eliah> thats a lot of fp
[8:47:45] <@QueequegTheater> rock kun why
[8:48:01] <%Valdorick> You had 3 +10 items though, its fiiiiiine
[8:48:02] <MaesePC> can u summon greg?
[8:48:03] <$MinoMiushi> Mimic is the best summon no joke
[8:48:05] <%dekkitout> And technically greg cost 0 fp Kappa
[8:48:06] <@QueequegTheater> Mimic chan will carry you
[8:48:13] <KasiCrafter> The funny part is that Pat isn't even using 100% of his power. He's not using his Physic and Power Within yet, lol
[8:48:45] <+imthinkingdarbys> yeah i was gonna ask if he'd done that opener with power within yet
[8:49:04] <morkelebmink> power withini s great
[8:49:18] <%Mantorok06> I spent forever fighting this enemy, I hated every second
[8:49:19] <morkelebmink> well it LOOKS like power within
[8:49:25] <morkelebmink> so that's what we're calling it
[8:49:27] <%Eldalu> Eldalu subscribed at Tier 1. They've subscribed for 24 months! heya pat! elden ring likes super dope! say hi to babies and paige for us
[8:49:30] <+HaloIsA> knowing how many bosses I have to refight after losing my save is a Fuck
[8:49:31] <+crimsonomen0> Hasn’t even used Kiaoken yet.
[8:49:50] <%Mantorok06> Killed it eventually but god, this fight is terrible and unfair
[8:49:59] <djblue_shift> would raising faith increase the damage from your weapon art?
[8:50:31] <youngin_______420> do it tho
[8:50:49] <+BeatBoxersDevMike> he's beginning to believe!
[8:51:12] <%Mantorok06> Did do it as a caster though, boi I die
[8:51:27] <ghoulspan> now this is an addict stream
[8:51:33] <%rosysyntax> red means dead ;)
[8:51:42] <morkelebmink> depends on scaling
[8:51:46] <Sigma_190_Beta> @PatStaresAt Maybe mess around with your flask? Since you aren't doing any spellcasting.
[8:51:48] <morkelebmink> what is the weapon scaling
[8:52:06] <Sigma_190_Beta> The Physick I mean.
[8:52:18] <immortanjoestar> how hard is this one in relation to the other FROMgames?
[8:52:25] <Sigma_190_Beta> Because you have Lightning Miracles buff with the shield.
[8:52:25] <digaogrunge> The physick flask
[8:52:27] <morkelebmink> oh you can back stab
[8:52:28] <%luftraumm1> scaling seems to matter
[8:52:30] <morkelebmink> INTERESTING
[8:52:32] <AtisutoCurry> DAMN
[8:52:39] <%X2Eliah> @immortanjoestar this boss, or this whole game?
[8:52:46] <Happydisaster> I think he meant Physick
[8:52:52] <LuminusVows> What
[8:52:55] <SomeAsianDood> what a command grab
[8:52:57] <FeralFozzie> he stab
[8:52:59] <Holofono> yooo, grabbed
[8:53:00] <tanarath> M O R T I S
[8:53:00] <+grapplingwithdepression> YO
[8:53:00] <AtisutoCurry> what
[8:53:02] <KasiCrafter> HE'S MGOT THEM TOO O NO
[8:53:05] <%rosysyntax> the boss is learning
[8:53:07] <immortanjoestar> the game @x2eliah
[8:53:07] <%dekkitout> Man he was really going for the command grab
[8:53:12] <+grapplingwithdepression> he hit that smooth 360
[8:53:14] <Sigma_190_Beta> I meant mess around with the Physick Flask.
[8:53:16] <zamdemega> oh my
[8:53:17] <%Monkeyweed21> Parrying is also really good against these guys
[8:53:20] <+crimsonomen0> Damn we got command grab and shit.
[8:53:22] <%AyotoCorp> I wonder if this guy can be parried
[8:53:30] <Happydisaster> When he’s staggered it better to use the ash over taking the critical
[8:53:34] <%X2Eliah> well hard to say, there's a lot of openworld zones that area easy, and a bunch of bosses that range from easy to idiotic hard.
[8:53:35] <Sigma_190_Beta> Okayl
[8:53:41] <%X2Eliah> but afaik its not as bad as sekiro
[8:53:51] <+678saintglock> @ayotocorp he can
[8:53:53] <%Monkeyweed21> @AyotoCorp the other black knifes can so probably
[8:54:12] <%RealThiele> talisman for heal on crit is so good on these guys
[8:54:13] <azure_dunes> I'm fighting the version of this guy in sage's cave and it is so fucking awful
[8:54:18] <+678saintglock> i just did like a few minutes ago
[8:54:26] <%KratzTv89> did you fight the one that looks and fights like the sword dancer from dark souls 3
[8:54:33] <+crimsonomen0> What kind of assassin gets back stabbed so much? Quit your job bro.
[8:54:56] <%Monkeyweed21> @azure_dunes either use a mob summon to keep him from dissappearing or get the lantern that reveals the invisible
[8:55:08] <%X2Eliah> wait I just realized Pat is basically furry-cosplaying as Sif now
[8:56:08] <sun312772> @PatStaresAt is he immune to dragon breath rot ?
[8:56:10] <Holofono> nice

[8:57:43] <tanarath> Master assassin & badass.
[8:57:43] <%rosysyntax> Did Pat kill that big white dragon yet?
[8:57:44] <%TurtlesAndTentacles> how do you know kw he's
[8:57:46] <%X2Eliah> So people keep asking what in this game is GRRM-like - this night of black knives, killing godwyn, is 100% grrm
[8:57:49] <Sol_Install> she sounds like a badass
[8:57:59] <Vermillion129> @rosysyntax iirc he did

[8:58:56] <tanarath> Rip big dragon
[8:59:03] <tanarath> That fight was sad
[8:59:06] <%luftraumm1> is fp talisman enough?

[8:59:17] <%luftraumm1> rip big puss

[9:08:58] <%luftraumm1> are ya gonna try to kill the  cristalians again?
[9:09:12] <%ScreamLord> I hope we get a Dragon Transformation at some point
[9:09:15] <%Valdorick> Rotten Breath is castable on horseback, if you ever want to cheese something hard.
[9:09:24] <KasiCrafter> Ooh! The Crystalians would be a good choice
[9:09:29] <%X2Eliah> @Valdorick oh?
[9:09:35] <sun312772> the powe withing
[9:09:36] <digaogrunge> Think of Greg spells
[9:09:51] <%Valdorick> Yeah, the empowered dragon breath spells can't be cast on horseback
[9:09:51] <+TheBitingIrish> Windows Update? modCheck

[9:11:23] <+AyupaPupa> this is the first souls game where my fp is longer than my stamina
[9:11:33] <%Valdorick> You'll need the extra mana too, for when you get the upgraded lightning spear
[9:11:45] <%luftraumm1> let's go boys

[9:12:42] <NaberiustheNefarious> he wont stop
[9:12:43] <%Valdorick> To be fair, a +10 summon just to tank here is pretty nice on its own
[9:12:56] <%RealThiele> assassin staying alive a lot better than oleg too
[9:12:57] <+OdysseyKnight> Very slowly tho
[9:13:05] <%dekkitout> Damn gurl

[9:13:44] <%ScreamLord> She'd of been nice to have for the Gargoyles
[9:13:49] <+OdysseyKnight> Need to give her something to fight that isn't near invulnerable to her weapon
[9:13:54] <Holofono> the dodges
[9:13:55] <%JustTheGuyYouNeed> she's just bullying him
[9:14:19] <+heyitsbrian> ... can you lose the fight to see how Greg would do solo?
[9:14:20] <%Mantorok06> She's playing with her food

[9:15:24] <bassoontyphoon> @sigma_190_beta who?
[9:15:27] <%RealThiele> shes low upgrade too LUL
[9:15:28] <tanarath> @zaheermyhomeboy +10

[9:15:31] <KasiCrafter> Just 1v1'd a boss
[9:15:34] <%dekkitout> This is the real reward for Ranni's sidequest
[9:15:38] <MidnightPacif1c> oleg &greg replaced in one stream
[9:15:38] <%pabloelenano2> im pretty sure she can
[9:15:39] <%ScreamLord> She's like if Tarkus was a lady ninja
[9:15:41] <Ghufufin> stick on an Elden Ring on that finger quick
[9:15:43] <Sigma_190_Beta> @bassoontyphoon Mispelled Rannie.

[9:15:56] <%luftraumm1> what can she do against a dragon
[9:15:57] <dashmatt> TICHE NEEDS HER OWN GAME
[9:15:59] <%tetraes> Lhutel +10 also slaps
[9:16:02] <%RealThiele> greg in lne at unemployement
[9:16:15] <%X2Eliah> Lhutel is good, but not this good
[9:16:21] <%strakillias> Have you murdered the bell bearing hunter yet?
[9:16:22] <+tizziks> Greg joins Oleg in retirement
[9:16:22] <%Valdorick> Lhutel never does anything for me. She just spams teleport and throws a spear that misses : /
[9:16:23] <%matf8> greg chilling with oleg at the bench
[9:16:34] <+OdysseyKnight> Now this will be a test
[9:16:41] <%X2Eliah> Also whenever Lhutel phases out, she tends to drop aggro so enemies refocus on you
[9:16:58] <RubberFistFight> god i just tried to fight this fuck
[9:17:00] <%Valdorick> HOLY DAMAGE
[9:17:00] <%RealThiele> bloodhound summon is pretty good too
[9:17:02] <%X2Eliah> Yeah Lhutel is kinda a distraction side tank, not so much dmg
[9:17:06] <dinonick79> Has pat beaten the red guy yet?
[9:17:08] <%Valdorick> She just did 1.5K damage ON HER OWN
[9:17:15] <fortheboyzs> thats a lot of damage
[9:17:15] <Vermillion129> just deal 1.2k by herself dont think about it
[9:17:18] <%RealThiele> popcorn time
[9:17:20] <digaogrunge> SHE CAN DO IT ALONE
[9:17:21] <+tizziks> oh yeah, her attack is fire
[9:17:53] <turdsman> I think she got this one too
[9:18:00] <fortheboyzs> that thing a she?
[9:18:05] <+wizard_of_diamonds> If you go too far away she might deaggro
[9:18:11] <%Valdorick> Yeah nevermind, the Crystal guys were a bad test, this guy is a good showcase.
[9:18:28] <morkelebmink> oh her blade beam sets things on fire
[9:18:31] <%justcallmebobplease> FUCK

[9:18:44] <Vermillion129> that fire blade rocks
[9:18:44] <AtisutoCurry> WTF
[9:18:46] <%whyskeywolfe> Fucking hell.
[9:18:48] <%Valdorick> That dot is % based, I'm pretty sure
[9:18:50] <%justcallmebobplease> Why did someone lie and say there was a boss here?
[9:18:55] <+beardy_foxbear> What a carry
[9:18:56] <KingKZ> Just give her the controller.
[9:19:00] <%RealThiele> new main character achieved
[9:19:02] <Saltmeisterr> WTF IS THAT DOT
[9:19:07] <%luftraumm1> almost
[9:19:10] <%ScreamLord> You maybe did 1/4 damage
[9:19:14] <%dekkitout> zimeNote Safe to say Tiche is pretty good
[9:19:16] <AtisutoCurry> this is peach playing bloodborne the NPC
[9:19:24] <FeralFozzie> Pat has found the ultimate power. getting someone else to do it
[9:19:25] <TheBlankAce> There's also the three great pot dudes you can fight to test her out
[9:19:25] <+crimsonomen0> So find out what her build is, and make that your build.
[9:19:30] <%rosysyntax> Did you get the crucible set yet that you had in the network test?
[9:19:33] <alextrebeken> is this live or the recording
[9:19:40] <%X2Eliah> @crimsonomen0 you cannot dodge like she does
[9:19:48] <%Valdorick> You can cheese those guys, by the way.
[9:19:49] <%X2Eliah> @alextrebeken its a live reconding
[9:19:50] <Happydisaster> Makes sense
[9:19:55] <%Valdorick> If you ever get sick of their shit.
[9:20:00] <%pabloelenano2> summon?
[9:20:02] <+tizziks> summons
[9:20:03] <%ScreamLord> Summon?
[9:20:06] <KasiCrafter> Summons
[9:20:21] <+crimsonomen0> @x2eliah you don’t need to dodge if you can throw a projectile that just melts a bosses life bar haha.
[9:20:24] <AtisutoCurry> oh summons?
[9:20:43] <%luftraumm1> set tiche on them
[9:20:45] <Happydisaster> They are essentially invaders then
[9:20:48] <digaogrunge> Just black flame them once
[9:20:56] <%X2Eliah> Pat can you flame from horseback
[9:21:03] <%RealThiele> and your FP doesnt run out completely from it now
[9:21:05] <%X2Eliah> ok
[9:21:08] <MaritimeSpanker> not much damage on him
[9:21:21] <MaritimeSpanker> but I assume it inflicts heavier load of frenzy
[9:21:33] <+Nomenanza> oh did you do a respec?
[9:21:39] <%ScreamLord> @PatStaresAt He meant Dragon Breath and yes you can if you put the Seal in your Right Hand
[9:21:52] <MaritimeSpanker> I went to bed with pat as a skeleton
[9:21:53] <+Nomenanza> nice, seeing some good numbers
[9:21:58] <MaritimeSpanker> I return to pat as a wolfman
[9:22:02] <%Valdorick> You can basic dragon breath on horse, but not empowered dragon breath.
[9:22:04] <anAngryHamster> Alright, I'm tapping out. Good night everybody
[9:22:06] <%ScreamLord> But...I did it
[9:22:09] <digaogrunge> The regular breath
[9:22:10] <%ScreamLord> Oh ok
[9:22:11] <%Valdorick> You CAN *jump* and dragon breath
[9:22:26] <NaberiustheNefarious> does anyone know if bloody slash works on reaper weapons?
[9:22:28] <timbob> At this point where do you do for the main game?
[9:22:30] <MaritimeSpanker> your penis?
[9:22:39] <Sigma_190_Beta> The guy in front of the sanctum?
[9:22:42] <djblue_shift> that bell bearing hunter or whatever?
[9:22:47] <+tizziks> @timbob Altus
[9:22:48] <+Nomenanza> god Blaidd armour is so cool
[9:22:48] <%RealThiele> Altus plateau and like 40% of the game remains
[9:22:49] <KasiCrafter> Wasn't it that guy in the Evergaol? The Ringleader?
[9:22:50] <sirrice77> @timbob atlus plateau then to the capital
[9:23:01] <%X2Eliah> @KasiCrafter yes
[9:23:13] <timbob> Ahh
[9:23:17] <%Valdorick> Did you kill Bellbearer at Caelid?
[9:23:21] <%ScreamLord> Now she's a pokemon
[9:23:27] <+tizziks> guessing the eyeball quest is still borked?
[9:23:28] <%luftraumm1> flintstone dragon
[9:23:32] <TheBlankAce> There's the cave where Radahn's arena is
[9:23:35] <Ghufufin> nightboss in shack?
[9:23:44] <%luftraumm1> dragon on moon island
[9:23:45] <%ScreamLord> Glintstone
[9:23:54] <tanarath> he snore
[9:23:55] <BurdRightsActivist> @TheBlankAce THERE'S A CAVE?
[9:23:57] <Ghufufin> did Pat kill nightboss with rotating sword?
[9:24:02] <+ajeanstarks78 > @patstaresat did you ever meet Alexander again
[9:24:12] <+The_EL_Destino> where r u Canada lol
[9:24:16] <pi_in_the_sci> maybe if you come at it from a different grace?
[9:24:18] <%X2Eliah> Did Pat kill the sleep monster?
[9:24:19] <%RealThiele> he try warping to a different nearby grace and walking here?
[9:24:28] <%rosysyntax> There's a secret boss wearing Crucible set by Strorm castle
[9:24:32] <%ScreamLord> Wait, you fucked the Moonlight Sword quest?
[9:24:33] <RedBlossomail> did pat do the dragonbarrow cave by the erdtree he just did?
[9:24:33] <+Nomenanza> I have no fucking clue how some quest triggers work. It is borderline impossible to meet some NPCs without a guide
[9:24:33] <BurdRightsActivist> @The_EL_Destino North of the US
[9:24:43] <%luftraumm1> imagine the amount of programming, I'm surprised only this quest broke
[9:24:49] <bassoontyphoon> @screamlord he got it
[9:24:58] <KasiCrafter> Oh hey, what about the gargoyle in front of the Bestial Sanctum?
[9:24:58] <%ScreamLord> oh
[9:25:00] <RubberFistFight> there's no guarantee it even broke
[9:25:05] <RubberFistFight> it could be a competing quest flag
[9:25:08] <%RealThiele> avoid bat country and take the lift
[9:25:14] <pi_in_the_sci> DId you ever find whatever was in "the heart of the rot" in caelid?
[9:25:19] <karl_rex> what quest broke?
[9:25:24] <%luftraumm1> oh there's the caelid tower left too
[9:25:24] <%ScreamLord> @KasiCrafter He has the Black Blade so yeah, he got that one
[9:25:27] <%X2Eliah> Imagine they just swing down and kill you
[9:25:31] <RubberFistFight> there is literally not enough information and for whatever reason the usual wikis and whatnot are incomplete as shit and not getting updated
[9:25:34] <+beardy_foxbear> Time for volcano manor
[9:25:35] <RubberFistFight> it's frustrating as hell
[9:25:41] <%Valdorick> I've found 4 ways into this loction that aren't the lift LUL
[9:25:46] <%RealThiele> volcano manor is great
[9:25:50] <%greasypete00> just got my first hard crash in the game on pc, really hoping we get a fix soon and my save isnt gone
[9:25:52] <penitentpendant> Like RE4, you're given two paths to go forward. You do one then double back and do the other.
[9:25:54] <%luftraumm1> oh you went up there?
[9:25:58] <bassoontyphoon> What kind of never ending story shit is this
[9:25:58] <%X2Eliah> The wikis are incomplete ash sh** for the reason that everyone is just discovering things now
[9:26:01] <RubberFistFight> @karl_rex festering fingerprint vyke isn't spawning. It's affecting a few people, but it's not clear whether it's a bug or a quest flag.
[9:26:03] <%strakillias> Pat got $200 for Caelid tower too
[9:26:19] <Vermillion129> welcome to Altus pat
[9:26:20] <+CatRidder> lot of cutscene in elden
[9:26:22] <%RealThiele> BFGs
[9:26:25] <RubberFistFight> @X2Eliah game's been out a week and simple basic information is still missing.
[9:26:28] <%SerpentScintilla> holy shit it must be late for you now, its my 9.30
[9:26:31] <KasiCrafter> Then the only place of note is The Ctumbling Lands, but that doesn't go anywhere, right?
[9:26:31] <RubberFistFight> like SIMPLE, BASIC shit.
[9:26:35] <RubberFistFight> not super deep lore shit.
[9:26:37] <WeebFever> I called this place the Atlus plateau for way too long

[9:27:00] <+beardy_foxbear> Npc at front of lift
[9:27:03] <%Valdorick> There's an NPC up here
[9:27:05] <RubberFistFight> and there are still [item goes here] and [location goes here] form-fill things all over the entries as well as a whole load of them being broken links or straight-up missing.

[9:33:04] <+WildSevens> Chainsaw
[9:33:05] <+LandOfTheWay> pizza time
[9:33:06] <Sigma_190_Beta> GHIZZA?
[9:33:06] <MaritimeSpanker> why is it bad?
[9:33:07] <sirrice77> @Nomenanza really? because i tried it and its way too slow for the damage it does
[9:33:10] <Sigma_190_Beta> YOU MEAN PIZZA?
[9:33:12] <+Nomenanza> It's R2s build bleed like a motherfucker
[9:33:16] <$MinoMiushi> It's so incredibly strong
[9:33:18] <%RealThiele> PIZZA TIME
[9:33:19] <tri3dgE027> Pizza Time~
[9:33:22] <+beardy_foxbear> L2 hold
[9:33:23] <SomeAsianDood> Time to cut some pizza LUL
[9:33:23] <sirrice77> I thought it was too slow for damage but i could've used it wrong
[9:33:24] <+WildSevens> The pizza cutter from bloodborne
[9:33:30] <Sol_Install> as a spiderman once said
[9:33:33] <Sol_Install> PIZZA TIME
[9:33:34] <$MinoMiushi> I've seen a single R2 do 3680 on a knocked down boss
[9:33:38] <%JonathLP> check fireplace
[9:33:39] <%ScreamLord> Basically the Pizza Cutter from the Bloodborne DLC
[9:33:41] <%null_the_exhero> Did you open all the rooms downstairs
[9:33:44] <SomeAsianDood> What's the description?
[9:33:47] <penitentpendant> Sleep well Pat~
[9:33:48] <+Nomenanza> One R2 non charged will bleed out in most cases
[9:33:49] <sirrice77> hmm i'll try it again
[9:33:53] <+Nomenanza> each spin does damage
[9:33:53] <NewWillinium> There's a merchant by the front door.
[9:33:54] <HyperionXV> You can hold the special attack and do a lot of bleed
[9:33:56] <MaritimeSpanker> good, cause I wanna watch the VOD and see what the heck happun
[9:34:00] <%Valdorick> Leaving in the Spencer Manor seems like a good starting point for next time, yeah
[9:34:01] <%justcallmebobplease> PICTURE
[9:34:01] <%JonathLP> portrait
[9:34:05] <%RealThiele> 3am streams forever
[9:34:06] <%justcallmebobplease> PAIGE ABOVE THE FIREPLACE

[9:34:32] <bassoontyphoon> !uptime
[9:34:33] <%RealThiele> LUL
[9:34:33] <@Moobot> @bassoontyphoon I've been playing this game for how long? Oh only 9h 34m.
[9:34:41] <+Nomenanza> @sirrice77 I'd say it is good. Against some invaders you can stunlock people with held L2 if they get between the saw and handle
[9:34:41] <penitentpendant> I think chat might be more tired than Pat
[9:34:45] <NewWillinium> Huh. He must not spawn in yet
[9:34:46] <Vermillion129> merchant not here
[9:34:47] <%whyskeywolfe> What merchant?
[9:34:49] <%justcallmebobplease> Oh, that's not Malenia's portrait?  My bad, it looked like it through the compression.
[9:34:50] <%shootbang_exe> no
[9:34:51] <%whyskeywolfe> There is no merchant.
[9:34:51] <%null_the_exhero> Just enemies out there
[9:34:57] <%X2Eliah> But pat its been 9 and a half hours you are so close to a 24 hour stream
[9:34:59] <%RealThiele> theres no merchant yet
[9:35:00] <MusouMiko> merchant only shows up if you actually join them
[9:35:01] <%JustTheGuyYouNeed> he is not here yet
[9:35:01] <NewWillinium> Think you need to tele back in for him.
[9:35:04] <%RealThiele> gotta kill istvan
[9:35:05] <%null_the_exhero> Merchant shows up later
[9:35:05] <MusouMiko> and rest at the bonfire
[9:35:06] <%shootbang_exe> just rest you'll see him after zone reset
[9:35:09] <+Nomenanza> Nah merchant will be there just not now
[9:35:10] <sirrice77> no theres a merchant but he wasnt there at first
[9:35:11] <NewWillinium> Ahhh
[9:35:14] <Vermillion129> did pat find merchant beforehand?
[9:35:16] <richmon_> another 9 hour stream and still tons of game left
[9:35:22] <NewWillinium> Apparenyly have to kill Istvan first
[9:35:28] <Vermillion129> there we go
[9:35:28] <%Valdorick> Oh... okay then
[9:35:32] <+LandOfTheWay> ha
[9:35:32] <HeroToxiko> i was so mad when patches dipped and i realized he just went here
[9:35:33] <%ScreamLord> We're just trying too keep you awake
[9:35:37] <%dekkitout> No shit this guy's here
[9:35:37] <%pabloelenano2> ofcourse he is here
[9:35:41] <%RealThiele> have to show your committed to the cause for merchant to show up
[9:35:44] <%Valdorick> OH, *this* is why he knew Rya
[9:35:49] <%X2Eliah> oh this seems like a MISTAKE
[9:35:49] <digaogrunge> OF COURSE
[9:35:50] <morkelebmink> patches!!
[9:36:04] <bassoontyphoon> What a cutie!
[9:36:05] <morkelebmink> you are on patches side now Pat
[9:36:07] <%X2Eliah> Its weird that he doesnt reset his stock
[9:36:14] <%RealThiele> he makes you do his assassination
[9:36:15] <+Nomenanza> I assume he is here if he disappears from the cave
[9:36:15] <Therusher> Volcano Manor gang let's go
[9:36:18] <%Valdorick> Oh right, he also sells the invasion items...
[9:36:21] <HeroToxiko> @RealThiele idk, he already left the old place for me and i haven't done any "evil" yet
[9:36:31] <%pabloelenano2> sing me up for volcano
[9:36:35] <Ghufufin> wild guess but i bet her master is mog
