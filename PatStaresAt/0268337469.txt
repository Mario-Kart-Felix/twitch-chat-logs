[0:39:14] <$Smolkupo> circle jump is better imo
[0:39:14] <@thenefftw> You could just not mash circle when you roll
[0:39:19] <%ziriken> not even 1.5
[0:39:20] <+Antoids> >less than a year and half>almost two years
[0:39:21] <mercado94> the remasted is fine i guess

[0:39:23] <%AbnormalVoid> @AngriestPat does the online code begin with "e" or "E"
[0:39:29] <JustLikeTheGypsyWomanSaid> I hope Capcom remember that Alex transferred herself into Natalia
[0:39:29] <Repwn27> @aog_jarlraven if you own dark souls prepare to die edition on steam it’s $20 instead of $40
[0:39:34] <AC9_Nineball> If you don't have L3 jump, you can hold block and it won't jump when you repress roll. You're welcome.
[0:39:34] <+KDZen_> If you want to be REALLY crazy you can bind running to one of the shoulder buttons so you never claw grip again

[1:04:13] <ThissisAwesome> Queso is a word invented BY WHITE PEOPLE WHAT THE FUCK ARE YOU TALKING ABOUT
[1:04:16] <ToneBacas> Paige's ex boyfriend because he didn't shower
[1:04:16] <ZephynM> Mexican Spanish is probably to Spain like how American English is to England.
[1:04:16] <InsomniacPersona> it is that different
[1:04:16] <Retrocop87> WE'RE AN HOUR INTO THE STREAM, LADIES AND GENTS
[1:04:17] <+TheFluff12> that is true
[1:04:18] <FairOnFire> Yeah they're different
[1:04:18] <%rdark_ksu> a dude in the desert along time ago who had milk in a pouch
[1:04:18] <%OdysseyKnight> Blanka players invented cheese
[1:04:19] <eduwardovich> You're not wrong, I guess...
[1:04:19] <Xelhesia> yea it is
[1:04:22] <mercado94> @AngriestPat yes thats true
[1:04:22] <TheImmortal70> Because it's two different provinces that are now two different countries
[1:04:23] <+KingZaffy> Cheese in spanish is pronounced "Gascoinge"
[1:04:24] <Hyperionyht> God invented cheese on the third day
[1:04:24] <RCtiger0> There are a lot of differences
[1:04:29] <%ziriken> THEY COULD NOT
[1:04:30] <+TheFluff12> there will be miscommunication
[1:04:30] <%KingQueso> every time before he said kwhy-so
[1:04:32] <SwindlerOfProgress> Not exactly, but close enough.
[1:04:32] <$Piemono> In that American English is way better
[1:04:33] <TalisKanju> That analogy doesnt work
[1:04:34] <MrLittleSam> I feel like white people invented cheese.
[1:04:35] <mercado94> Im mexican and its basically true
[1:04:35] <Innocuous_Goat> There's a story that a dude's milk turned to cheese while he was crossing the desert on camelback.
[1:04:37] <%WorthlessSamurai> something something Goat milk in a bladder in the desert
[1:04:37] <DraxTD> @AngriestPat "It originated through the transportation of milk in bladders made of ruminants' stomachs due to their inherent supply of rennet. There is no conclusive evidence indicating where cheese-making originated. However, it may have originated either in Europe, Central Asia, the Middle East, or the Sahara."
[1:04:38] <%TheMattman1313> @AngriestPat The topping is TexMex cuz we're weird assholes.
[1:04:39] <+cereal_box_conspiracy> warm milk in a middle-eastern goat-skin canteen = cheese
[1:04:39] <+patriotrenegade> @AngriestPat Cheese predates history
[1:04:40] <deviljhojho94> Spaniard mexican is shit for dubbing LUL
[1:04:40] <+Silversunburst> Spain Spanish is called Castallano.
[1:04:41] <ZephynM> Piemono nateUSA nate7
[1:04:44] <puddingpants88> Mesopotamians invented cheese. but it was a curdled soup more than the bricks we know
[1:04:47] <eduwardovich> Spaniards speak with a lisp, in my experience.
[1:04:54] <+SenorCounter> It's like american and British english
[1:04:58] <+SenorCounter> broadly speaking
[1:04:59] <TalisKanju> Mexican Spanish is WAY BETTER than European Spanish
[1:05:03] <+GeneSlamm> The big difference I know is that zs are pronounced "th" in castillian
[1:05:06] <$GohanEgret> B R I C C
[1:05:08] <+ScrubingtonTheThird> Quebec French isn't even french tho, it's its own language bastardization
[1:05:09] <TheImmortal70> YOU EAT YOUR FUCKING CURDLED SOUP
[1:05:11] <@thenefftw> Waow

[1:05:14] <Bouldus> bricc o cheez
[1:05:16] <zmuno> @Silversunburst No, castellano is from castilla..and it's not the same as spanish
[1:05:16] <SubliminaIMessages> Like in Narcos when Pablo's Portuguese accent was apparently WAY off
[1:05:17] <$Mendin> He shits bricks and then has to go to hospital
[1:05:17] <+GeneSlamm> Like "Corathon"
[1:05:17] <%half_awake1> they have that, it's called velvetta
[1:05:19] <Erisin1> @AngriestPat Tony Cheese invented cheese you idiots
[1:05:19] <ThissisAwesome> Then it wasn't cheese. It was curdled milk.
[1:05:19] <%Imperial_Madman> i have lego bricks
[1:05:21] <SwindlerOfProgress> Castellano just sounds fancier, but it can be easily understood.
[1:05:23] <%Isthajore> Velveeta bricks for life.
[1:05:25] <@PlagueOfGripes> Who invented milk
[1:05:26] <%rdark_ksu> @AngriestPat Mexican spanish also has a class divide in the language in how the rich/poor sound. Shits crazxy

[1:05:47] <Swagsouls> I like to prefer to believe the word "quesadilla" literally translates to "cheese day". I know this is not the case, but the spanish word for day is "dia" which sounds close enough.

[2:01:41] <The_Devils_Muse> people
[2:01:45] <Press_X_ToJASON> break before 1 sec of gameplay, this is why we watch
[2:01:49] <+DrBunn> Emptying the balls of pee
[2:01:51] <bloodypurpledog> Woolie has a good character design and that tattoo will only make it better
[2:01:55] <%Isthajore> @SaltyDongs Pat had to splash. On the floor.
[2:01:58] <+0samura1> Talking nonsense has always been the most important part of the stream
[2:01:58] <%BlackMage66652> So the longer this goes on, are we gonna see Paige's heroin kick in more?
[2:01:59] <Bouldus> who TF came here for gameplay?
[2:02:03] <TalisKanju> This time, Pat will be the one to fall asleep
[2:02:04] <Intolerable> "I've been playing this game"

[2:02:11] <Conop_> cant wait for 10 minutes of gameplay and another 2 hours of talking

[2:02:26] <%GarbageNirvana> Right so what did I miss
[2:02:32] <FackincrazySheik> Pat had to go inject his marajuanas
[2:02:36] <%Plutt_bug> You missed donations
[2:02:37] <+redstonej> he's pissing all over the place
[2:02:40] <$GohanEgret> @SoarFlyer the back tattoo puts him super close
[2:02:40] <%WorthlessSamurai> @GarbageNirvana Absolutely nothing Jebaited
[2:02:41] <darkfire344> I would legit watch a stream of just banter
[2:02:42] <+SoarFlyer> @Plutt_bug Don't talk about your mother that way

[2:03:11] <%GarbageNirvana> Has to hold the toilet paper just right
[2:03:12] <TalisKanju> Those David Cage tattoos are going to be the deepest shame for the Best Frienda
[2:03:13] <%superc37> did they seriously do an hour long stream of jist reading donations
[2:03:16] <clonexsniperx> so pat is misfiring and dropped the toilet roll into the bowl?
[2:03:16] <%AnOverdoseOfDeath> Maybe this pee turned into a poop
[2:03:17] <%Plutt_bug> Did Pat get it on the roof? what a champ!
[2:03:18] <+SoarFlyer> Pat misfiring would be him getting it IN the chemical toilet
[2:03:22] <shadic7701> Pee flooded apartment

[2:04:33] <+DrBunn> @SuperCasualBoom HAH
[2:04:33] <shadic7701> Seamen is stored in the bladder!
[2:04:38] <ThePuddingDead> How's everyone tonight?
[2:04:42] <%SGrim> He peed on the damn ceiling at this point.
[2:04:45] <FackincrazySheik> BUTTS
[2:04:45] <+Antoids> honey is stored in the bees
[2:04:48] <SuperCreeperBlocks> Pat is pissing EVERYWHERE
[2:04:49] <%ziriken> @Keeble24 it was some donation during the undertale stream i think. i still dont know if i want them to come out liking it or for the game to be a trashfire
[2:04:55] <bloodypurpledog> Thats a ginormous whiz he's taking
[2:04:57] <+SoarFlyer> @shadic7701 that's a huge semen
[2:04:58] <Conop_> the bathroom has flooded with pee
[2:05:01] <TalisKanju> Did Pat drop the toilet roll again?
[2:05:02] <%Plutt_bug> Piss is stored as a gas in the testicles then released as a liquid
[2:05:03] <$MightyMaxT> Doing good. Watching the stream & grinding in Tekken
[2:05:06] <MonstersDogma> The house is now flooded with piss
[2:05:07] <CatmanIX> shit, what i miss, left for a minute and came back to BRB screen
[2:05:07] <%Isthajore> Pat pees in the tub confirmed.
[2:05:09] <rosemon5001> random info a type of duelists were removed from the story of yugioh 5ds because the voice actor was part of a dangerous sex cult
[2:05:11] <+urbnbuddha> Maybe he's Shap Shifting
[2:05:13] <PopdropGardner> It's odd how she pronounces Shapeshifter
[2:05:14] <+grandmonkbun> Pissed on the floor again
[2:05:15] <+SoarFlyer> pee is stored on the bathroom floor
[2:05:15] <Grayhammatter> the bathroom is absolutely flooded at this point
[2:05:20] <@thenefftw> The thing about Detroit is that it isn't really a Cage game
[2:05:32] <@thenefftw> Cage wasn't head writer
[2:05:32] <%Plutt_bug> If Pat could reach he would pee in the sink
[2:05:34] <Everpresent_Overseer> Pat sure is taking long again time to assume floor piss
[2:05:39] <shadic7701> @soarflyer imagine the pressure you could shoot with bladder support!
[2:05:43] <%ziriken> oh really? damn. that sucks
[2:05:44] <%SuperCasualBoom> Breaking News: Pat fell in the toilet and transfer into the Super Mario Super Show cartoon.

[2:05:45] <Ell1ot> Railith's comic has become a reality
[2:05:56] <rosemon5001> @grandmonkbun nono its stored on the walls and drips down like nectar
[2:05:57] <%Isthajore> @thenefftw I heard you don't get to fugg androids, so the game is worthless in my opinion.
[2:05:59] <Intolerable> Anybody else been playing souls since the stream started?
[2:06:02] <Psykoknight65> @thenefftw its was written and directed by him dude
[2:06:02] <SwindlerOfProgress> How much urine can a pair of testicles POSSIBLY have?
[2:06:02] <Ell1ot> Fireman Pat will save the day
[2:06:02] <+ymorn> peeing on the sun would only make it hotter
[2:06:05] <Wyrmsblood> Out with the old piss, in with the new piss
[2:06:06] <+KoyaMusa> big ol pee

[2:28:44] <IntrepidEye> Adventure Time is really hit or miss
[2:28:45] <%GarbageNirvana> Is Paige one of those people who hates the new Thundercats
[2:28:46] <AncelDeLambert> Adventure Time is boring as hell
[2:28:46] <count_bob> Thank you Peach.

[2:28:58] <+patriotrenegade> Steven Universe, Adventure Time, Regular show all have bad art
[2:28:58] <BeefyQueefer> Adventure Time is only good up to season 4. After that it's all about fulfilling tumblrs shipping fantasies.
[2:28:59] <AncelDeLambert> It is pure pot humor

[2:41:24] <CatmanIX> @AngriestPat Bee and Puppycat is by Natasha Allegri, not Rebecca Sugar
[2:41:24] <Namboto> @patriotrenegade mostly I feel it was mostly the network screwing the show over and dragging it out. A lot of the recent episodes have been real good.
[2:41:27] <hntronium> Shin Neo Plague

[3:08:12] <DeathByPoke7> i call target toilet because i work there
[3:08:12] <%kewlmyc> Yep
[3:08:13] <%flamingcuscus> Target came to Canada and didn't offer better prices or better products so people stuck with what they knew and target failed miserably
[3:08:13] <Wistelligence> Yep, I remember Ward.
[3:08:14] <%Keeble24> you think TARGET is trashy???/
[3:08:14] <+SenorCounter> 20yrs ago
[3:08:14] <@JustinianKnight> they went outta business
[3:08:15] <Shemegory> I thought target has been in the red for years? Target AU is profitable though
[3:08:16] <+SoarFlyer> when do these streams end usually?

[3:08:22] <DantesAnimus> Better than having to go to Walmart
[3:08:22] <fussyphuk> What's the name of that dep with the winking owl?
[3:08:23] <%ssjklyco> Monkeywards is gone
[3:08:24] <%SuperCasualBoom> I tried to walk into Target but I miss - Mitch Hedberg
[3:08:26] <%Keyd00d> despair stream FeelsBadMan
[3:08:28] <%RubberFistFight> @AngriestPat - if it's cheaper, get sulphamic acid. You can get it as descaler in a powder form and mix it with water, and it's basically the same stuff as CLR.
[3:08:32] <TurtlesAndTentacles> YES
[3:08:35] <+Comrade_Vladof> target a shit, walmart also a shit
[3:08:36] <+Reaper102388> Are Millenials killing your business?
[3:08:37] <%ssjklyco> ours became an Ikea
[3:08:38] <+SenorCounter> Target is where you go to when you don't want to go to Walmart

[3:09:00] <AtlasMcCoy> Doesnt that mean the only way pat can live forever is to be as uncool as possible
[3:09:00] <%Keyd00d> ooohhhh Kreygasm
[3:09:03] <BeefyQueefer> Target in Australia is identical to the American one in branding but it's completely owned by different people due to someone stealing the trademark/copyright when it lapse for a day or two in Australia.
[3:09:07] <bloodypurpledog> Pats being immersive
[3:09:09] <+maxamillion629> Look up Wegmans. It’s better than whatever grocery store you have
[3:09:10] <fireking900> Man that made me think about TB FeelsBadMan
[3:09:10] <+Epic_Skeptic> What you know about Montgomery Ward

[3:09:18] <turf_wind_and_fire> Goin down to Blightown, gonna have myself some fuuuun
[3:09:20] <%Remery_> We're all just shitty waffles, wishing to be pancakes
[3:09:21] <Shaggnar> Target is just a less convenient wallmart that has less horrifying people in it
[3:09:24] <Press_X_ToJASON> that was a sexy corpse
[3:09:24] <Grayhammatter> pats bringing the immersion hard today
[3:09:26] <admiralsatan> peenerbutter is best butter
[3:09:26] <TaifuDragon> @AngriestPat I'm almost certain in Australia they ran an ad for "Target aka Target (silent T)"
[3:09:27] <ape_hawk> hey guys, if you want a really competent LP of MGSV, chip cheezum just started his and its fucking great
[3:09:28] <%RubberFistFight> @BeefyQueefer - that's why you gotta keep on top of your trademarks.

[3:12:54] <admiralsatan> kill them all pat
[3:12:55] <%Grey_Frog> I mean, realistically, the person who's cutting Pat's hair will want to talk to him. And will probably accidentally spit in his hair during conversation.

[3:14:03] <%SSaryn> Pat. I for one, know a person, who would spit in your hair.
[3:14:04] <%Laecerelius> Is Pat a llama?
[3:14:04] <grayjammer> Pat. Nobody has LESS self control than you do
[3:14:05] <@CreepyPorpoise> Pats getting toxic at the barbershop
[3:14:06] <+patriotrenegade> @AngriestPat Rest assured given the legal opportunity, I would spit on you
[3:14:07] <alwayspronking> #2 LUL
[3:14:09] <Shastafield> OpieOP i would spit in your hair
[3:14:09] <%ssjklyco> The fallacy is youre a crazy person
[3:14:10] <Gameslayer2> What self-control?
[3:14:12] <%Grey_Frog> Pat, they would get fired
[3:14:13] <ZE_Count> ohh pat your brain is a special place.
[3:14:14] <SophisticatedDinosaur> One time these 2 russian kids got in my face on my walk home from school, so i spit apple chunks at them
[3:14:17] <+maxamillion629> They just spit in the spray bottles
[3:14:18] <megamanx74> no point on losing a job over such nonsense @AngriestPat
[3:14:18] <+JenovasPuppet> Haircuts work like Uber. Just get a chair in the back if you don't want them talking to you.
[3:14:19] <AncelDeLambert> Pat, you're a freak
[3:14:21] <IntrepidEye> Hey Pat you should be more worried about hobos with syringes running up to you while you're in the chair
[3:14:22] <$Dutchpotato> I do
[3:14:23] <%Plutt_bug> Pat has hair?
[3:14:26] <+SoarFlyer> @CreepyPorpoise that's why they instinctively spit at him
[3:14:27] <wookie5358> Barber shops are a professional environment; if they lack self control, their ass would be fired and they know it
[3:14:27] <Mesonoxian_Methuselah> Maneater Mildred time?
[3:14:27] <+Blargimazombie> Paige is so flabbergasted by this train of thought
[3:14:27] <BeefyQueefer> Pat you don't have self control, you've spent thousands on costumes for video games.
[3:14:28] <+Llyrumi> Is there hair to spit on?
[3:14:30] <DXLelouch24> Pat were gonna find you next con and spit in your hair
[3:14:30] <+D3rrtyD4n> pat truly has a beautiful mind OpieOP
[3:14:42] <%Plutt_bug> I HAVE MET THAT PERSON
[3:14:44] <%Keyd00d> ???
[3:14:45] <%RubberFistFight> @AngriestPat - it's not them spitting in your hair you need to worry about. What if they pick their nose and rub it in your silky locks?
[3:14:45] <Psykoknight65> you can be mean to someone with having to know them/be important
[3:14:46] <bloodypurpledog> Does that mean Paige is pregnant
[3:14:46] <%Zombiemowlcher> Was there ever supposed to be a fight in that pit?
[3:14:46] <Rellim80> Those people don't have jobs
[3:14:52] <+Bloodxb> so,u.pat
[3:14:52] <wookie5358> It would be like you spitting on someone while working retail @AngriestPat
[3:14:53] <%CaptainPileDriver> what hair
[3:14:56] <Kemmybelle> I don't maintain conversation with a stylist when I get my hair done and they've never spit in my hair. You'll be fine.
[3:14:58] <$GohanEgret> what if you take an uber somewhere but they're a serial killer
[3:14:59] <%SSaryn> Paige, cut his hair.
[3:14:59] <%SaltyDongs> Wait does everyone have a nega clone?
[3:14:59] <Everpresent_Overseer> They might know Pat from this stream and they might think now it's my chance to make his nightmares come true!
[3:15:02] <%Zombiemowlcher> Cause that super looks like a fight pit
[3:15:07] <Shaggnar> Let Pat grow a skullet
[3:15:07] <@Mechz71> Maybe the barber is just trying to give you a good spit shine on your head
[3:15:11] <+patriotrenegade> @AngriestPat PAIGE SHAVE HIM IN HIS LSEEP
[3:15:13] <admiralsatan> the skullet is cool
[3:15:14] <%TheMattman1313> @AngriestPat Just shave it yourself?
[3:15:14] <TsarinaAlexandra> @angriestpat Just cut your own damn hair, you have so little to begin with danW
[3:15:14] <pineapple_pizza0> just cut your own damn hair
[3:15:16] <admiralsatan> fuck off
[3:15:17] <@CreepyPorpoise> just shave it all off with an electric razor
[3:15:18] <%MisterCrimson> @AngriestPat you don't get it Paige, people are terrible people and will always do the worst possible thing you can think of them doing to you specifically.
[3:15:19] <+D3rrtyD4n> those people get ostracized, pat
[3:15:19] <+SenorCounter> Get a guy barber man!
[3:15:19] <+phantom_creep> that would not happen because we do not want to lose our license, and there are mirrors everywhere for you to see, i should know i have been a barber for 6 years
[3:15:21] <lilybergo> if youre just gonna be full egg, why dont YOU just cut it?
[3:15:23] <@CreepyPorpoise> why waste money on a haircut
[3:15:26] <Gameslayer2> Just shave it yourself
[3:15:30] <%SaltyDongs> Get your nails did and get your hair done
[3:15:31] <admiralsatan> the skullet is fine
[3:15:33] <IntrepidEye> buy some clippers and learn to cut your own hair
[3:15:33] <Shastafield> NotLikeThis this circular reasoning
[3:15:35] <%Remery_> They either spit into you hair or whisper in your ear, you have to choose one

[3:15:45] <+JenovasPuppet> Pat tell us your barbershop so we can pay them to spit on you.
[3:15:47] <@SpaceCaptainCrone> Spit in your own hair before you go, that's the only way to be SAFE
[3:15:48] <Press_X_ToJASON> barber shart
[3:15:51] <Grayhammatter> the barber shart
[3:15:51] <+SenorCounter> Are you sure it's a barbershop and not a Salon?
[3:15:52] <ThissisAwesome> She's asking you to do this, because she is disgusted by your unkempt hair.
[3:15:52] <DantesAnimus> Jesus
[3:15:52] <+maxamillion629> Go to a salon

[3:16:04] <ZE_Count> Pat did you get a Gary Busey head injury when you were younger?
[3:16:05] <+SoarFlyer> I will infiltrate the barber shop to spit in Pat's hair
[3:16:06] <lilybergo> l e w d
[3:16:07] <leinadtonu> Is this a sex thing?
[3:16:08] <fireking900> WHY DID YOU TRUST THEM IN THE FIRST PLACE

[3:16:39] <Clammy_chan> Barber is far more serious than wife hooker
[3:16:40] <+Reaper102388> PAT WILL NOT CHEAT ON HIS BARBER... it's sacred
[3:16:41] <%flamingcuscus> To be fair to Pat, if somebody IS gonna spit in your hair it'd be Montreal or Edmonton

[3:16:42] <Caidezes> WHAT THE FUCK PAT
[3:16:44] <+universefish> how is that wierd
[3:16:44] <ThissisAwesome> It's unmanly. Pat is the man of the relationship. He makes the rules, and he isn't a snowflake.
[3:16:44] <BeefyQueefer> Does Pat visit one of those topless barbers and he's hiding it?
[3:16:44] <Twoiis> Too intimate.

[3:49:12] <NineFourEightSeven> I don't understand a single word of this song. What's a Shershootair?
[3:49:23] <Grayhammatter> a sure shooter
[3:49:25] <%boondoggle42> Shapeshifter
[3:49:26] <%RubberFistFight> I heard the words "post masquerade"
[3:49:28] <%RubberFistFight> but yeah
[3:49:28] <ObsidianDragon86> I honestly thought for the longest time she says Cheshire King
[3:49:32] <%TheBlackMandalorian> @trnzero Whats wrong with the third act Im on act 2
[3:49:32] <+camodikk> its the vanishing platforms, they disappear after a set amount of time, and you have like limited platforms to kill 16 enemies
[3:49:34] <%RubberFistFight> the rest of the lyrics are a mystery.
[3:49:35] <+maxamillion629> @ninefoureightseven it’s shaft shifter
[3:49:42] <CharileMurphyPendelton> still waiting for Hyper Light Drifter and Dead Cells to come to da Switch

[3:49:55] <+SoarFlyer> @maxamillion629 peener shifter
[3:49:57] <PopdropGardner> Chat quick question, Is it worth hauling around a RPG in Stalker, how rare is it's ammo?
[3:50:02] <@ThePlotHole> What
[3:50:06] <+trnzero> @TheBlackMandalorian i'd have no idea as i haven't played the game, this is just what i found from the news source
[3:50:07] <ObsidianDragon86> Not worth it
[3:50:09] <+m00nd0g1994> I'm a shapeshifter at Poe's masquerade
[3:50:11] <%RubberFistFight> "Chained down to my... something..."
[3:50:12] <@ThePlotHole> What is this about fine meme-ing
[3:50:13] <ObsidianDragon86> Take a Grenade Launcher instead
[3:50:14] <DantesAnimus> how are there people more deaf than I am....???
[3:50:18] <Grayhammatter> to my core
[3:50:19] <ObsidianDragon86> Underslung

[3:50:40] <MonsieurHedge> surely ONE DAY i will get this darkmoon invasion
[3:50:40] <+maxamillion629> I wish this was just an instrumental song with jazzy improv solos over it
[3:50:41] <%boondoggle42> Paige banned someone earlier for telling the bad meme
[3:50:43] <MonsieurHedge> i need ears
[3:50:45] <ObsidianDragon86> @PopdropGardner Just take a grenade launcher. RPG is SO not worth it

[3:53:33] <CharileMurphyPendelton> we go to Ashen Lake yes?
[3:53:34] <+JenovasPuppet> Probably gonna get big spoilers if you stream the MSQ.
[3:53:39] <+m00nd0g1994> pat calm down dude stop freaking out about your "not puking" after drinking the coconut water
[3:53:40] <NineFourEightSeven> we all know telling pat not to do something time consuming and redundant is pointless
[3:53:42] <@CreepyPorpoise> We're so polite and kind, not spoiling the game for him
[3:53:42] <+SenorCounter> like a shit wine
[3:53:43] <alwayspronking> It's like riding your bike?
[3:53:46] <+LogothX> streaming is like an orange
[3:53:47] <PopdropGardner> Are you gonna be streaming the story? Be nice to see that
[3:53:47] <shweedles> making love?
[3:53:50] <%GarbageNirvana> It only seems logical to be mad at Pat
[3:53:50] <alliedmastercompy> Streaming is the failure of the game designer?
[3:53:57] <Grayhammatter> yes
[3:53:58] <Everpresent_Overseer> it's like a box of chocolate~
[3:54:07] <+maxamillion629> @grayhammatter yes

[3:54:14] <%RubberFistFight> Unless, like me, you're ok with spoilers.
[3:54:16] <%TheSniperJoe> or stream with someone to watch chat
[3:54:16] <ObsidianDragon86> So what your saying is Chat should ALWAYS be at a constant state of Dissaproval?
[3:54:17] <BeefyQueefer> steaming is like a peenor. some times you get it smooth, some times you get it crunchy
[3:54:20] <leinadtonu> Streaming is like getting a haircut
[3:54:23] <+kirk0625> when's quelaag?
[3:54:25] <%SSaryn> Too bad Memeurai isn't as good as MNK...
[3:54:31] <%RubberFistFight> Spoilers don't bother me because they usually lack important context
[3:54:31] <@SpaceCaptainCrone> Pat was the main tank, I was the good tank.
[3:54:32] <@CreepyPorpoise> "Main tank"

[3:54:39] <%boondoggle42> Samurai?... but teh meta...
[3:54:41] <NineFourEightSeven> why do people go to Ash Lake before being able to warp?
[3:54:48] <%RubberFistFight> @Pandora_Prime - Freeza is that you?
[3:54:48] <@JustinianKnight> This doesn't have to do with not doing the story
[3:54:48] <%Kingkaiju0618> oof all i want from shadows die twice, is that he walks on stage, says, we brought it back, and then you just hear a ds1 hit moan really loud
[3:54:50] <%ssjklyco> Streaming is like getting people together in a big room to watch you play videogames and viv
[3:54:55] <@ThePlotHole> Do the story tho
[3:54:57] <+Robotface174> pat hows life
[3:54:58] <%SSaryn> I just wanna play my SAM man..

[3:55:24] <@JustinianKnight> big MEME
[3:55:24] <@ThePlotHole> A big meme
[3:55:25] <%bumbletroni> Samurai and Ninja both seem like fun dps classes
[3:55:26] <%RubberFistFight> @ssjklyco - unless you're me and streaming is basically sucking at video games whilst 4 people stay in your stream out of pity.
[3:55:29] <@CreepyPorpoise> Pats a big meme, but not a good meme >:C
[3:55:36] <RowenCleric> Dragoon for life

[3:55:53] <grayjammer> A scythe is basically just a big dab
[3:55:54] <shweedles> she'll eat your mans
[3:55:56] <+m00nd0g1994> @creepyporpoise hes not a tall meme thats for sure
[3:55:56] <%SSaryn> Been looking to get into DRG, definitely not as complicated as MNK or Ninja.
[3:56:06] <viewtifulr> big boy pat fights alone
[3:56:10] <%boondoggle42> are porpoises rough?
[3:56:11] <%BlackMage66652> @AngriestPat Would you have sex with her?
[3:56:11] <+SoarFlyer> @grayjammer why would you say this
[3:56:12] <+Robotface174> thats a big creepy crawler
[3:56:13] <%TheSniperJoe> i miss when dark knights used scythe weapons in xi.
[3:56:14] <CharileMurphyPendelton> WHEN'S LEGEND OF DRAGOON REMAKE @SonyPlaystation
[3:56:18] <+LogothX> that sword sound is goofy as hell
[3:56:20] <%DedlokPM> That's what I call big damage

[3:57:15] <LORDSPOOKLEKINS> Oh man look at that pizza sauce on the ground
[3:57:16] <NineFourEightSeven> that was fast
[3:57:17] <bloodypurpledog> It's nice knowing a giant spider lady has the time to style her hair before a big fight

[3:57:23] <%RubberFistFight> @Meme_Platinum - if you connect your twitch account to discord and restart the app, it should autoinvite you
[3:57:23] <+Mekhet09> So why do you hate mage classes? It's pretty challenging in some areas. Especially in 3. Though it makes a joke out of hard enemies otherwise.
[3:57:24] <%Keyd00d> Ruffles cheese and sour cream
[3:57:26] <@Pandora_Prime> YOU LOOK LIKE SHIT
[3:57:26] <DSD24> Girls with that hairstyle always look good

[3:58:42] <LORDSPOOKLEKINS> PIZZA LAKES

[4:01:45] <AncelDeLambert> COWARD OUT CEASELESS
[4:01:48] <ObsidianDragon86> Does Ceaseless still have that Cheeseball way of beating him?
[4:01:48] <%RubberFistFight> @Smolkupo - there are a small but extremely loud group of people that are shitting all over the remaster for fucking every imagined slight, it's absurd
[4:01:49] <@JustinianKnight> ehhh
[4:01:49] <@thenefftw> Pat can do it
[4:01:52] <+AncientToco> lost lasagna
[4:01:55] <CharileMurphyPendelton> CEASELESS PENOR
[4:01:57] <+SoarFlyer> @TalisKanju only crunches on the east coast you mean
[4:02:01] <Psykoknight65> cheese him, like everyone else
[4:02:01] <@JustinianKnight> It looks...somewhat better, but not great
[4:02:01] <Intolerable> "it ain't no bad"
[4:02:03] <+Mekhet09> It doesn't matter how it looks because it is still the shittiest area of the game.
[4:02:06] <%Plutt_bug> Pat, what do you think of Omensight?
[4:02:12] <deliciouspies> yeah he jumps to get you
[4:02:13] <+ChronoBirb> ya
[4:02:14] <%bumbletroni> I've never done this fight legit
[4:02:16] <%boondoggle42> @b0neh34d not only did you miss Paige, you missed her bare feet on stream
[4:02:17] <deliciouspies> but he jumps over a pit
[4:02:18] <%RubberFistFight> @Mekhet09 - yeah it's kinda the equivalent of polishing a turd
[4:02:19] <+ChronoBirb> all the way to the entrance
[4:02:22] <@SpaceCaptainCrone> They start discharging and don't cease discharging
[4:02:22] <%SSaryn> Hey man, he trips. Like a Smash player.
[4:02:22] <Psykoknight65> cause he impales himself on the pillar
[4:02:23] <$Smolkupo> @RubberFistFight Right? I'm sure they attack it simply because of a herd mentality
[4:02:24] <yosukecchi> he become earth
[4:02:25] <deliciouspies> like a big dumb ifdiot
[4:02:27] <+ChronoBirb> He falls apprently
[4:02:29] <AncelDeLambert> he bursts into gooey bits
[4:02:30] <Sotetsu> You hit his hand and he falls into the ravine.
[4:02:35] <%mister___doctor> I'll never stop making fun of that dumb video that called this remaster "insulting" before it came out
[4:02:36] <@Mechz71> @SpaceCaptainCrone good meme
[4:02:36] <TalisKanju> You can only crunch on the East Coast
[4:02:36] <@Pandora_Prime> Cheese him
[4:02:37] <shweedles> sorry friends gotta dip, work in the A.M.
[4:02:38] <%IKilledADeadGuy> He falls into a pit
[4:02:39] <@PlagueOfGripes> he didn't want to jump and glitch out for me this time
[4:02:41] <+SoarFlyer> what a meme
[4:02:41] <%Plutt_bug> He big boy
[4:02:41] <Intolerable> Just run back to the gate. He falls to his death.
[4:02:42] <NineFourEightSeven> he runs out of ground and falls when you hit his dumb clumsy fingers
[4:02:44] <bloodypurpledog> He dies when he is killed
[4:02:45] <@Pandora_Prime> See if they fixed it
[4:02:46] <+Cobaltor_252> hey look its a chaos spawn
[4:02:46] <%OdysseyKnight> Paige when she reaches the final stage of lupus
[4:02:49] <%RubberFistFight> @Smolkupo - what a lot of them are doing are buying the game just so they can leave a shit review and then putting in a refund basically immediately.
[4:02:52] <+Mekhet09> It wasn't a bug.
[4:02:55] <deliciouspies> idk a lava pit
[4:02:59] <@SpaceCaptainCrone> @Mechz71 Thank you, I studied classical memery at Juliard.
[4:03:01] <CharileMurphyPendelton> Dark Souls has the best and most imtimidating bosses in the series
[4:03:07] <%Keyd00d> It wasn't glitched
[4:03:09] <Grayhammatter> people die when they are killed
[4:03:09] <deliciouspies> maybe it's like the deep end of the pool, but you know, lava
[4:03:10] <Press_X_ToJASON> ceaseless peener discharge
[4:03:10] <%SSaryn> Hey, it's like the thing your dick does Kappa
[4:03:10] <+SoarFlyer> Pat you looked at the pit
[4:03:19] <%RubberFistFight> Steam needs to tie the minimum time til review in to the maximum time til no refund.
[4:03:28] <AncelDeLambert> yeyeyeye fatalityyyyyy!
[4:03:28] <%RubberFistFight> that way people can't fuck with the system the way they are
[4:03:29] <deliciouspies> also watch out for the mexi beam
[4:03:33] <Futurecity10> @AngriestPat When he does the final smash attack, he has a unqie animation where he's holding onto the ledge, you attacking him flinches him making him fall to his death
[4:03:33] <flavonoskovitch> I have never seen this work
[4:03:35] <TalisKanju> @spacecaptaincrone Are you Keith David?
[4:03:37] <+Mekhet09> Basically the area near the gate is too far and he uses his hand to maintain his grip.
[4:03:37] <Intolerable> WHY ARE YOU GOING THE LONG WAY
[4:03:38] <%SSaryn> Waow
[4:03:44] <ObsidianDragon86> O_O

[4:03:59] <CharileMurphyPendelton> DS3 is awesome in next Gen graphics but over game design inferior to DS1
[4:04:00] <Grayhammatter> what a loser
[4:04:01] <Intolerable> run
[4:04:02] <Icebandit> man, this boss is so shit when you fight it normally though.

[4:04:03] <Intolerable> RUN
[4:04:09] <deliciouspies> this is the pit
[4:04:10] <Minorou> ...is his stamina bar longer than his health bar
[4:04:10] <Sotetsu> Hit his hand!
[4:04:12] <AncelDeLambert> HITIIIIIM!
[4:04:15] <@thenefftw> Hit him
[4:04:16] <+ChronoBirb> awwww
[4:04:19] <CharileMurphyPendelton> DS2 would be better if it wasn't called a Dark Souls game lol
[4:04:19] <+ChronoBirb> He looks soo sad
[4:04:20] <Psykoknight65> smack his hand
[4:04:20] <+Bouerd> he's standing on nothing

[4:04:47] <Icebandit> I always do a quick 5 jabs with my off hand fist to kill him
[4:04:48] <+ChronoBirb> Congrats
[4:04:50] <%Keyd00d> "bug"
[4:04:51] <bloodypurpledog> Good job
[4:04:52] <%bumbletroni> That isn't a bug
[4:04:53] <ThePuddingDead> that was....kinda flaccid
[4:04:55] <%ssjklyco> i did not know you could do that
[4:04:56] <+Mekhet09> He's using the ledge to grab on.
[4:04:56] <Intolerable> NOT A GLITCH
[4:04:57] <b0neh34d> Is it a bug? it looked like he latched to the wall?
[4:04:57] <deliciouspies> he basically takes fall damage and dies
[4:04:57] <Press_X_ToJASON> AMAZING
[4:04:57] <+KamenOtaku> FALL DAMAGE
[4:04:58] <%RubberFistFight> @AngriestPat - the lava lake is lower there. He jumps to try and get you and winds up clinging to the ledge over a huge pit.
[4:04:58] <Animal_Farm4> He has to jump to the ledge you're on, the idea is that you make him lose his grip so he falls down into the pit
[4:04:58] <PopdropGardner> @angriestpat Guys I shit you not as soon as Pat was hit by that first lava beam my computer just died and restarted
[4:05:00] <+LogothX> You defeated Ann Coulter.
[4:05:01] <umbypokochan> that's a funny meme
[4:05:02] <%Keyd00d> It clearly has an animation for falling
[4:05:02] <Psykoknight65> maybe the pillars wrong, but what did happen was you made him lose his grip so he fell
[4:05:03] <ObsidianDragon86> I guess they realized he was seriously a bullshitty boss
[4:05:04] <+JenovasPuppet> You... did it.
[4:05:08] <%HiroTSK5> What the shit was that?
[4:05:09] <+DarkOnyx7> he hangs onto the ledge and then falls like an idiot elaKek
[4:05:09] <+ChronoBirb> Ya no it's not a bug, he actually falls down and dies
[4:05:13] <@PlagueOfGripes> it may or may not be bug related, but it certainly looks like shit
[4:05:14] <+Bouerd> It happens every time
[4:05:20] <%IKilledADeadGuy> That pit
[4:05:22] <+dougrayman> CRAZY TALK!!!
[4:05:30] <%Arxel1> CRAZY TALK
[4:05:31] <+jezred14> C R A Z Y T A L K
[4:05:33] <%OdysseyKnight> Looks like they either fixed the bug or made it an official way to beat him
[4:05:35] <+Gulping> the skelmoening
[4:05:36] <@SpaceCaptainCrone> He just lets it set in
[4:05:38] <%Keyd00d> If that actuyally happened then that one is a bug
[4:05:41] <@PlagueOfGripes> he always did that
[4:05:42] <ThePowerOfRa420> Crazy Talk Activate
[4:05:43] <Intolerable> NO IT DIDN'T
[4:05:44] <%SaltyDongs> apatCrazy T A L K
[4:05:45] <%Keyd00d> but normally not
[4:05:53] <deliciouspies> maybe his stamina drains from holding himself up
[4:05:54] <+SoarFlyer> he just wanted your meme butter Pat
[4:05:56] <@PlagueOfGripes> you're creating false memories
[4:05:58] <deliciouspies> cause he's a big boi
[4:06:01] <+Gulping> So pat how's the framerate treating you
[4:06:02] <PopdropGardner> All I heard was him talking ahit and the lava comes flying towards him and then my whole screen goes black lmao
[4:06:06] <+KoyaMusa> he does that all the time eli
[4:06:10] <Psykoknight65> @odysseyknight he was never a bug in the original you do the same thing you made him lose his grip and fall
[4:06:11] <%boondoggle42> not false memories. fake news.
[4:06:25] <Gruntini> "meme butter"
[4:06:27] <@SpaceCaptainCrone> The truest lore is the kind you make up as you play.

[4:09:21] <%RubberFistFight> @AngriestPat - man it's so great that you and paige actually acknowledge your audience. So many streamers and youtube celebrities don't even recognise their numbers as actual people.
[4:09:24] <AncelDeLambert> Bad Taste Pat strikes again
[4:09:25] <Fujiwara_92> damn
[4:09:31] <henryvolt> you know what would be a good idea. Marathoning through both the classic MegaMan classic series
[4:09:34] <%SSaryn> You're still in Worst Coast Kappa
[4:09:35] <%s_xylocalsingles> dont get my hopes up Pat
[4:09:41] <%s_xylocalsingles> get back under the bus ssaryn
[4:09:46] <%SSaryn> No

[4:09:52] <CharileMurphyPendelton> DAT FLASH
[4:09:53] <+KoyaMusa> man not much gameplay this time to cut up into ad revenue :^)
[4:09:57] <TalisKanju> West coast is worst coast and best coast
[4:10:09] <%SSaryn> Or at least Alpha 3.
[4:10:09] <+JenovasPuppet> East Coasters will die 3 hours earlier.
[4:10:28] <%TheSniperJoe> cheer200 . . . how much do we need to donate to get "Pat Stares at Disneyland"?
[4:10:30] <TaifuDragon> I'm glad it happened, The Expanse is fucking awesome
[4:10:31] <%RubberFistFight> Yeah SyFy cancelled the expanse because they're a bunch of cunts who can't commit to anything.
[4:10:34] <+maxamillion629> The way the camera is framed it looks like someone is gonna sneak up behind pat and spit in his hair
[4:10:38] <%Meme_Platinum> ey
[4:10:39] <+SoarFlyer> They got a plane to drag a sign saying "#SAVETHEEXPANSE"
[4:10:45] <+Gulping> pat died to rats
[4:10:53] <bloodypurpledog> Buffalo Wild Wings was on their bullshit today
[4:10:53] <%RubberFistFight> Man, FUCK SYFY.
[4:11:00] <%RubberFistFight> like, for real.
[4:11:06] <TalisKanju> Being on the west coast means avoiding the internet if you want to watch TV
[4:11:09] <CharileMurphyPendelton> SyFy is a shit channel ya guys
[4:11:16] <TalisKanju> for 3 hours
[4:11:17] <CharileMurphyPendelton> Krypton is a Joke
[4:11:21] <%TheSniperJoe> that buffalo wild wings shit was hilarious.
[4:11:24] <%SSaryn> DATABASE DATABASE
[4:11:29] <TaifuDragon> Krypton is pretty good as far as superman goes but holy SHIT is is boring
[4:11:38] <CharileMurphyPendelton> Krypton with them posh English Kryptonians
[4:11:44] <TaifuDragon> Getting less boring
[4:11:47] <TaifuDragon> Still pretty boring
[4:11:51] <%RubberFistFight> @CharileMurphyPendelton I'm old enough to fondly remember the Sci-Fi channel and I remember feeling horrified in the depths of my soul when they announced their name/image/brand change.
[4:11:53] <xbb1024> hello!

[4:14:29] <NopeBadguy> @AngriestPat Any plans to play either of the Torment games on stream?
[4:14:36] <%GarbageNirvana> Real talk, MHW's got good quality of life stuff and awesome new monsters, but it's sorely lacking in content compared to the others
[4:14:39] <%SSaryn> Daora's worst honestly..
[4:14:42] <%OdysseyKnight> I have an easy time with teostra
[4:14:45] <+zetaplus> mhw endgames pretty bad
[4:14:46] <%NMEDom> FUCK
[4:14:46] <%GarbageNirvana> And the fact that we're getting Generations Ultimate means I might actually backslide a bit
[4:14:48] <Sielas> Pat playing PS:T would be PogChamp
[4:14:59] <Innocuous_Goat> Tempered Kushala is the worst post patch
[4:15:06] <bloodypurpledog> I just realized Pat isn't looking at the camera and I don't know if thats weird or if it'd be weirder if he was
[4:15:06] <%SSaryn> apatWink apatWink apatWink Big memes.

[4:16:46] <ObsidianDragon86> Nah, just take an electric razor to it
[4:16:48] <risenlp2> end of stream? or just a break?
[4:16:49] <SuichiTanaka> I hope it wouldn't be that way, but I feel like the really strong personalities of Peach and Crymetina would not get along well
[4:16:49] <%RubberFistFight> @AncelDeLambert - good on him though that was great news
[4:16:52] <CharileMurphyPendelton> Woolie Vs Japan features Feilcia
