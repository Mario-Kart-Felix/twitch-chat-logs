[0:13:14] <omen_setter> Rapture all the way
[0:13:16] <shogunomega> Wrong stream
[0:13:18] <%Maids4lyfe> Columbia is full of racism
[0:13:19] <CookieDoughFK> Until Rapture gets hit with covid
[0:13:19] <%nofestu2> Columbia was always racist
[0:13:19] <LoneO7> no
[0:13:20] <%moogleboy1984> you can be up in the air easy as fuck
[0:13:20] <Daxalog> Everyone in rapture has a syringe is going to get you
[0:13:21] <%xUmbraNinja> To corona
[0:13:21] <Coystick> Wrong
[0:13:21] <%DesuDesuDokiDoki> WHAT

[0:13:22] <%GalacticaPhanto> As a Latino I'd be FUCKED in either one
[0:13:23] <Mister_McDerp> correct
[0:13:25] <+Jontman42> that's incorrect
[0:13:26] <%fairore> @screamlord cmonBruh
[0:13:26] <%koffeemancer> Colombia has secret racism so no
[0:13:26] <%Awkward_Internet_User> Stop touching your face
[0:13:28] <Coystick> FLying>wet
[0:13:29] <%Mr_Pylon> Water has horror, sky has... falling
[0:13:29] <%d3na3> Pat check out the silent hill reboot rumors
[0:13:30] <s1rcuit> Colubia doesn't like blacks
[0:13:30] <%R3Roundabout> Columbia would not be fun for Woolie
[0:13:30] <%xUmbraNinja> WHAT
[0:13:31] <%Rumbutt> Unless you're scared af of drowning
[0:13:33] <DXLelouch24> no Corona in THE FUCKING OCEAN
[0:13:34] <%PerrinIsDead> Colombia fuck the ocean dude
[0:13:35] <%superc37> rapture is fucked but at least you won't get lynched
[0:13:35] <+Arkfyre> art deco is premium aesthetic
[0:13:36] <%Frost_Quill> @PatStaresAt But underwater is also SCARIER than flying.
[0:13:36] <ShichiNoBushi> Everything's better down where it's wetter.
[0:13:37] <+Jontman42> that's correct
[0:13:38] <Galacta_Pieta> The first hour or so of infinite is by far the best part of the game
[0:13:39] <%asgard147> Yeah it is
[0:13:40] <j0ustar> very true
[0:13:41] <chidere> monkaW Water
[0:13:42] <dreu81> neo classical
[0:13:43] <%segonian> always true.
[0:13:44] <+EyeFarted> Wasn't Columbia SUPER RACIST?
[0:13:44] <%filialpails> neoclassicism?
[0:13:44] <%PerrinIsDead> Would you rather drown or die from falling
[0:13:45] <%SoFarFetched> Art DECO
[0:13:45] <%nofestu2> Americana
[0:13:45] <+thelonechris> I like Columbia's aesthetic more
[0:13:47] <j0ustar> colonial?
[0:13:49] <%DesuDesuDokiDoki> wrong on all counts
[0:13:50] <DatAsuna> Americana
[0:13:50] <Mister_McDerp> neoclassical
[0:13:50] <BoneofMalkav> Neo Classical
[0:13:52] <TheTunnelSn8ke> Americana/Federalist
[0:13:54] <%depressed_skeleton> Hi pat, i'm pat. psaSmug_RB
[0:13:55] <%Maids4lyfe> Neo Classical
[0:13:55] <%Frost_Quill> The ocean is scarier though.
[0:13:55] <%MosesUnspoken> Not sure I have the complexion for Columbia
[0:13:56] <Baeltyr> @EyeFarted yea, but tbf so was rapture
[0:13:58] <%moogleboy1984> Victorian
[0:13:58] <%superc37> murica
[0:13:59] <nexus92x> Also Cthulhu lives in the water!
[0:14:01] <+thelonechris> Steampunk
[0:14:02] <%xUmbraNinja> WHAT!
[0:14:02] <+Who_lio42> Rather deal with the crazies than the rascists
[0:14:03] <+Blargimazombie> Dada
[0:14:05] <%GarbageQueenEllie> I don't like the idea of underwater pressure and drowning, so Skyline for me plz
[0:14:06] <AmericanaRed> AMERICANA
[0:14:07] <DatAsuna> I prefer sky city
[0:14:09] <%spiritofmojave> Americana/steampunk makes sense
[0:14:09] <CookieDoughFK> Ventilation in rapture will carry COVID to everyone in the city
[0:14:10] <%Dementedpenguin> I would be scared shitless that the floating city might fall at any time.
[0:14:11] <LoneO7> why would you ever want to go near the ocean?
[0:14:12] <dreu81> i've been to miami so i'd choose columbia
[0:14:12] <nexus92x> And GODZILLA lives their too!
[0:14:13] <+HappiestFace> art nouveau

[0:14:22] <%Agami23> i dont wanna set the world on fire
[0:14:24] <Glitterplague> Art Nouveau
[0:14:24] <TwinBat> RACISTS lol
[0:14:26] <marvel877> post-civl war reconstruction?
[0:14:30] <Mister_McDerp> RACISM
[0:14:32] <LoneO7> but wage slavery is the only acceptable form of slavery
[0:14:34] <dreu81> manifest destiny

[0:14:43] <AmericanaRed> AND COKE
[0:14:44] <@commanderclaw> Good ol Jim Crow

[0:14:48] <%MosesUnspoken> Alt Slavery
[0:14:49] <%Rumbutt> So Columbia basically just the US oroLUL
[0:14:49] <omen_setter> Columbia is full of squares. People in rapture actually fucked and made their dicks huge
[0:14:50] <lidlandy> murdaWtf
[0:14:51] <%xUmbraNinja> WHAT
[0:14:51] <%Jolnir> Kappa
[0:14:54] <Baeltyr> ahaaaaaa, of course
[0:14:54] <%chaumiester> Class Slavery?

[0:15:08] <fruit_pie_the_magician> Institutionalized Racism
[0:15:09] <%Awkward_Internet_User> isnt that just being employed?
[0:15:09] <Huntercd> Colombia super racist
[0:15:11] <TheTunnelSn8ke> I'd go for Rapture over Columbia too.
[0:15:12] <%Frost_Quill> Slavery with Extra Steps is from Rick and Morty.
[0:15:17] <%DesuDesuDokiDoki> Slavery 2.0
[0:15:18] <Baeltyr> :O

[0:16:05] <chidere> Ninjutsu and Omnyo were OPin Nioh 1
[0:16:07] <$Chatterbox1991> As we are speaking, litterally the crowd of Smackdown consists of Triple H and Michael Cole as light shows and music continues to play at full volume and people look out to the seats and cut heel promos as if the people were still there, ring announcers say the words "Ladies and Gentlemen" despite neither being present, this literally feels like a bizarre Lynchian dream sequence, please send help o.o
[0:16:08] <%Target616> ODACHI SPEAR

[0:24:42] <%xUmbraNinja> YEAH
[0:24:42] <coldfire0007> Story is very different

[0:24:45] <+Zutrax> I'd say it's about as good, slightly improved.
[0:24:45] <%superc37> Nope. it is both a sequel AND a prequel, if that makes sense
[0:24:47] <jeosadn> AAH my pc.
[0:24:47] <%CommanderSqueaks> BIDOBOOP!
[0:24:48] <tusk102> @PatStaresAt no but it is better
[0:24:48] <+Ell1ot> did a bunch of devices just connect to your pc Pat?
[0:24:48] <%PinkSuprende> Absolutely invalidates it except for the nonexistent story.
[0:24:52] <%haystacks89> nice
[0:24:52] <Animorphimagi> no
[0:24:55] <TheTunnelSn8ke> Windows 10 would like to know your location
[0:24:57] <ovan20> NO
[0:25:01] <+Who_lio42> No really, first one has real good fights
[0:25:02] <nexus92x> Well, Nioh 2 IS a Prequel so kinda?
[0:25:02] <Coystick> Is it the sign of a good sequel or a bad sequel if it invalidates the first one?
[0:25:06] <%2DSuperiority> zoneDosh zoneDosh
[0:25:07] <%medusasghost> woooo
[0:25:07] <joey_jo_jo_juniorshabadoo> Ironic that Nioh is considered a 'Souls like' game when it was created by the makers of Ninja Gaiden, the game Dark Souls ripped off
[0:25:08] <$joylent_blue> Paige connected to his pc, that's what the noise was
[0:25:10] <@StridentSong> Max said it felt like an expansion for the original game more then it's own game
[0:25:11] <Captain_Joe1911> nooo
[0:25:11] <%spiritofmojave> never
[0:25:12] <%Dementedpenguin> psaSmug

[0:25:23] <%Ranryu692> I spent my raise on Paige and Woolie
[0:25:25] <worldbrand> pat can have little a bit of your raise money, as a treat
[0:25:29] <Psykoknight65> it may be the meme weapon and people will hate on it because how over used it is, but I love the switch glaive
[0:25:30] <EclecticDemon> youuuuu
[0:25:31] <%it_was_too_long> psaHoldon
[0:25:32] <%Garthunox> @baeltyr ok well you can freely switch around with weapons, proficiency with a weapon gives a skill point for that weapon specifically, so go nuts
[0:25:33] <%alcors_wisdom> pat can have a little raise as a treat
[0:25:34] <+netrac> I personally have 0 issue for a derivative sequel

[0:39:13] <LORDSPOOKLEKINS> Nobunaga is the BEST
[0:39:14] <+hunterm93> Yeah, that was kind of loud
[0:39:14] <%xUmbraNinja> It’s fine

[0:39:20] <%Engwithan_Elder_God> We'll see
[0:39:20] <%J_Papa> That was loud but let's see
[0:39:20] <TheTunnelSn8ke> If it were an early era, we'd have Hojo Tokimune.
[0:39:21] <%TIME_PUNCHER> turn down for what
[0:39:21] <qu3kl41n_the_impure_king> just the cutscene
[0:39:21] <Dr_Mooose> seems fine
[0:39:21] <$Dakuu75> it's fine
[0:39:21] <KitsuneSidhe> He is and it's kind of hilarious.
[0:39:21] <Dragon_Batman> Might have been the cutscene
[0:39:22] <%GarbageQueenEllie> white samurai time
[0:39:22] <Animorphimagi> Benedict Arnold WAS A TRUE HERO
[0:39:23] <%RedKnightVI> it's fine

[0:39:23] <+Jontman42> was good
[0:39:24] <ToneBacas> it good
[0:39:24] <%derekwst3> play samurai warriors
[0:39:25] <%thecasket> The Nobunaga everywhere system

[0:39:27] <vVAstrAVv> SO IS OROCHI
[0:39:28] <majindusto> NOBUNAGA IS ALWAYS THERE...WAITING
[0:39:29] <DatAsuna> Nobunaga literally pulls a Hnery from no more heroes
[0:39:29] <%Valentinius_Anodyne> Nobunaga is actually pretty great in Nioh 1
[0:39:30] <numbus_26> cutscene was loud
[0:39:30] <%KishinGrek> Its good
[0:39:35] <%patriotrenegade> OROCHIIIIIIII'
[0:39:35] <%valriot> @PatStaresAt Pat this game is secretly Nobunagas ambition
[0:39:36] <%alcors_wisdom> cutscene was loud but tis fine now
[0:39:36] <Storm_Samurai> English voice actor for hilarity
[0:39:38] <fattyboy067> is it dub or sub
[0:39:38] <Glitterplague> it's fine, if it gets too loud i'll just lower my volume
[0:39:42] <Ipsenscastle> Benedict Arnold was a brave fickin' dude

[0:40:00] <$floralkami> @glitterplague he means compared to his voice
[0:40:02] <%patriotrenegade> he seems cool
[0:40:02] <$lotharrio> Hideyoshi is looked at the same way that any famous general from a civil war is looked at. Some people like him, some are pissed that he killed their distant family members, and almost certainly someone has a boner for them.
[0:40:02] <%AncelDeLambert> Ara ara

[0:40:20] <%Typhaeon> ONI
[0:40:23] <Hellarussian> Zodd
[0:40:25] <ScreamLord> @PatStaresAt Nobunaga and Hideyoshi are known as 2 of the great unifiers of Japan. And as such are both loved and hated by the general populous because Unification was good, but war is bad
[0:40:26] <%GeneralSCPatton> Cheer500 Iirc, the bad guy summons Nobunaga's ghost, expecting him to just conquer Japan, but after the boss fight, he peaces out back to the afterlife. Being dead significantly increased his chill.
[0:40:29] <robbierottensrottenrectum> STANDO
[0:40:30] <%GarbageQueenEllie> @nexus92x Aw gross, I don't need that Tale of Genji shit

[0:41:02] <heartlesshealer> because humans are shit, even when heroes
[0:41:02] <%Frost_Quill> @EclecticDemon I think this is a prequel?
[0:41:03] <Dragon_Batman> From their point of view they did nothing wrong
[0:41:03] <%juxtest> That'll teach you to be a monster!

[0:48:03] <%xUmbraNinja> Calm down joey
[0:48:04] <%Parapattern> We taught him wrong. As a joke!
[0:48:04] <zafooru> axe wizard
[0:48:05] <%Axellogic> Hatchets have a weid movset but have ranged attacks
[0:48:06] <%KishinGrek> Nice
[0:48:06] <%Binary_Fireball> is there a blunt weapon?
[0:48:07] <%GarbageQueenEllie> try all of them and see what you like best
[0:48:08] <%averyoddjew> shut up, video game
[0:48:10] <junks2300> Pat, could you show off the spear? I cant find like, any gameplay of it.
[0:48:11] <ScreamLord> Shut up it's Oni Magic
[0:48:11] <%Typhaeon> Tomahawks
[0:48:13] <Skeletonmanners> this is some castlevania shit
[0:48:13] <Blank9> Hatchets let you throw them infinitely
[0:48:15] <%CommanderSqueaks> It's a God of War
[0:48:17] <%derap41> Pulling them straight out of your ass
[0:48:18] <%moogleboy1984> @joey_jo_jo_juniorshabadoo By "Souls games are a rip off of Ninja Gaiden", you mean, Souls games are a rip off of King's Field, right?
[0:48:20] <+sizableidiot> @Binary_Fireball there are tonfas
[0:48:22] <%patriotrenegade> magic is for nerds
[0:48:22] <%rumtumtugnutz> Kuratosu?
[0:48:22] <FrankysDream> do hatchets!
[0:48:25] <trulythedude> DUAL SWORDS
[0:48:28] <%CommanderSqueaks> Of course YOU don't like magic
[0:48:28] <Jynnanmalect> ninjas get magic too
[0:48:28] <heartlesshealer> that switchglaive seems to scale off magic???
[0:48:29] <Monkeyweed21> switchglaive scales with magic
[0:48:30] <+Pookiedaexzile> What about Justus
[0:48:31] <crimsonsaens> It scales with two other stats
[0:48:32] <%Axellogic> Switchglaive also scales off constitution
[0:48:32] <Animorphimagi> you NEED magic tho
[0:48:34] <%segonian> he looked like a cave troll wearing a wig. it is was awful. I tried to an hour to make it work.
[0:48:35] <%patriotrenegade> @PatStaresAt are there tonfas?
[0:48:35] <%YakumoYomi> Skip Switchglaive then
[0:48:35] <fattyboy067> change your other weapon
[0:48:35] <DatAsuna> Magic is OP in this game if you learn about the debuffs they apply7
[0:48:36] <zafooru> throw away your bloodborne
[0:48:37] <heartlesshealer> Do you have access to inventory?
[0:48:37] <%Piemen99> YEYEEYEYE
[0:48:39] <chidere> Magic OP
[0:48:39] <+nekodelic> that's why you go with the chains
[0:48:41] <duende667> Spear is so OP in this game, the early demon type you get is awesome
[0:48:42] <+Pookiedaexzile> Do byou like chi
[0:48:47] <%derap41> So change out the Glaive
[0:48:47] <heartlesshealer> Can you check the stats here?
[0:48:48] <%Axellogic> Each weapons scales with 3 stats
[0:48:48] <Animorphimagi> magic is just buffs dood
[0:48:48] <%SvenHolgersson> Hello Patrick I am here and eating nuggies and fries how are you today
[0:48:48] <LoneO7> dual axes are the way to go
[0:48:50] <austinj24> Katsurigama?
[0:48:51] <EuropanLamprey> YEAH SELLSWORDS!
[0:48:52] <ScreamLord> @PatStaresAt Switchglaive is a Magic Weapon
[0:48:52] <%Axellogic> so they are flexible
[0:48:54] <%Calek> @PatStaresAt you just get a + 1 to your magic stat, doesn't mean anything in the long run
[0:48:55] <+AllenDeadman> can I become yojimbo in this game_
[0:48:57] <%GarbageQueenEllie> Love me some two swords one style
[0:48:57] <zafooru> Throw away the glaive for a better normal glaive
[0:48:58] <zayasu> just get the biggest weapon :)
[0:49:00] <heartlesshealer> kusarigama is here on the floor
[0:49:01] <%Target616> these are just starting weapons, the main thing is stats. youll get the weapon later on with loot
[0:49:01] <%patriotrenegade> Id go for range personally
[0:49:03] <%thecasket> Switch the switchglive for like a odachi or something if you don't like the magic
[0:49:11] <TheTunnelSn8ke> Dual kats seem good.
[0:49:16] <%Typhaeon> It looks like you're choosing 2
[0:49:17] <plzza_kun> switch out the switchglaive then
[0:49:18] <heartlesshealer> oh hell yeah <3
[0:49:19] <%trekkie11041> sword + odachi is a pretty good set
[0:49:21] <nuane> KUNAI WITH CHAIN
[0:49:21] <%Axellogic> I would say choose weapons based on stat first
[0:49:21] <Dr_Mooose> love this weapon
[0:49:23] <coldfire0007> You choose 2
[0:49:23] <Mister_McDerp> dex jermaDisgust
[0:49:24] <Endlesslyforgetful> just get rid o switchglav
[0:49:24] <EuropanLamprey> PICK THAT FOR FEED
[0:49:24] <+PE4X> i mean you can choose 2 anyways
[0:49:25] <Oxybe> CHAIN GANG
[0:49:26] <+Pookiedaexzile> Why choose anything else
[0:49:28] <$rottingcrawler> This isn't gonna be on steam is it :'c?
[0:49:28] <DamnGoodCake> dont get too attached, youll get better weapons quickly
[0:49:29] <%Axellogic> you will get all the weapons as drops
[0:49:29] <MayShip> swinging a chain
[0:49:31] <%psydaku> check out the tonfa
[0:49:32] <tolloponik> berry the slinger
[0:49:32] <%Typhaeon> Kusarigama x Switchglaive is what I'd do, that or Odachi/Glaive
[0:49:32] <%thecasket> Kusarigama was my jam in Nioh 1
[0:49:33] <junks2300> Remember, you get two weapons
[0:49:34] <Tucker0603> WAIT NO ONI CLUB?!?!
[0:49:34] <ne0bunny> if you dont like magic then change the switchglaive to something else
[0:49:34] <trulythedude> black star!
[0:49:34] <+Jontman42> Kusa and dual swords for ninja shit
[0:49:34] <%michingmallecho> I know but...you know psaSmug_RB
[0:49:35] <%GarbageQueenEllie> Kusarigamas are so freaking stylish
[0:49:35] <RushUnplugged> aren't starting weapons just a +1 stat anyway, just pick cool shit and change later
[0:49:35] <critfumble_> TONFA OR COWARD
[0:49:36] <Perky_EDF> Glad to see the Kusarigama still has it's "I can hit you from beyond vision range" attack
[0:49:37] <TheTunnelSn8ke> Kusarigamas are so underappreciated in games.
[0:49:38] <ScreamLord> @PatStaresAt If you want to replace the Switchglaive, equip it and pick up another weapon
[0:49:38] <ECRead> Anyone know if bare fists are as good as they were in 1?
[0:49:40] <$Dakuu75> chain eats stamina SO HARD
[0:49:40] <$galaxyswirl> im pretty sure this is just for starting bonus stats
[0:49:43] <%patriotrenegade> @PatStaresAt is there a club or mace?
[0:49:43] <%LadyTheWanderer> chain scythe super cool
[0:49:43] <joey_jo_jo_juniorshabadoo> Kings Field has a different game mechanic all together and is more in line with traditional dungeon roaming games such as Wizardry
[0:49:46] <Dragon_Batman> If it's like the last game, you'll just get others anyway
[0:49:47] <%YakumoYomi> TAKE OFF SWITCHGLAIVE IF YOU DON'T LIKE MAGIC
[0:49:48] <+dante_must_die_exe> You go that way, I'll go home!
[0:49:48] <MassConnect> do it coward

[0:51:42] <coldfire0007> Its a good balance

[0:56:10] <Dragon_Batman> It's nice that you get to play around with them
[0:56:10] <$Dakuu75> Shark, imo
[0:56:11] <TheTunnelSn8ke> ...okay, bird seems the most kickass so far.
[0:56:13] <+Fyre_link> Bird is best
[0:56:13] <tusk102> VERGIL

[0:56:16] <%LadyTheWanderer> SHARK
[0:56:16] <%MoulesFritz> @TheActuallyGuy well, pat just activated his DT so it's looking like yes
[0:56:18] <+hawk_rush> shark is the best
[0:56:18] <JerZeyCJ> The bird's attacks let you dodge out of them so you're not locked in
[0:56:18] <+SweepTheLegoMyEggo> if only you took the time to customize their looks
[0:56:19] <Sol_Install> shark
[0:56:19] <Ipsenscastle> Beowulf kick

[0:57:28] <Jakeofalco> important
[0:57:28] <%thecasket> This phantom counter was always finicky as shit for me
[0:57:29] <%KishinGrek> Shark Enema

[0:57:45] <Commander_Spyke> The timing is tight
[0:57:45] <+sadhistorymajor> is this the witcher 3?
[0:57:46] <%GarbageQueenEllie> Next Persona game is gonna be purple, calling it now
[0:57:46] <$lotharrio> Sectoids in ancient Japan...
[0:57:51] <+hawk_rush> dark souls counter leggo
[0:57:52] <%Axellogic> Each form's counter has different timing and utility
[0:57:52] <Skeletonmanners> its a Preta, a buddhist thing
[0:57:55] <majindusto> THATS...AN...ALIEN
[0:57:55] <fattyboy067> you can use other demon forms if you don't like the parry
[0:57:55] <Jakeofalco> blue is best
[0:57:57] <Archmortal> tight window for the counter, but you still at least get the block for almost getting it
[0:57:59] <heartlesshealer> I hear shark has the tightest window of the counters, but not sure how the bird's is
[0:57:59] <+Pookiedaexzile> Somebody say tight window
[0:58:00] <%BoomerUnchained> Kill the turok shadow baby

[0:58:17] <CookieDoughFK> Nioh 2 is just bloodborne but in Japan
[0:58:20] <%derap41> Living weapons kinda sucked
[0:58:20] <Blank9> Shark is the hardest timing and worst one

[1:07:27] <crimsonsaens> Weapons scale with 3 stats
[1:07:27] <$RealThiele> magic bad sucka
[1:07:27] <%MrBorisMakarov> weapon scaling probably
[1:07:28] <sonofthedeepsouth> CAUSE
[1:07:30] <%valriot> You have 7 magi already
[1:07:30] <nerdblase> Dump it all into Heart!
[1:07:30] <ECRead> Magic is spells
[1:07:31] <duende667> you should use the first samurai armor set
[1:07:32] <fattyboy067> because magic is already at 7
[1:07:32] <tusk102> @PatStaresAt magic is for magic, not physical damage
[1:07:36] <%Axellogic> look at the weapon for the stats it scales offf of
[1:07:37] <DamnGoodCake> depends on the weapon
[1:07:38] <%griffball13> goblin time
[1:07:42] <%GeneralSCPatton> FINICKY SCALING MATHS
[1:07:42] <RushUnplugged> big dick glaive is con scaling
[1:07:44] <heartlesshealer> CLUTTER
[1:07:44] <%trekkie11041> psaGoblin it begins
[1:07:46] <%Parapattern> ALREADY
[1:07:47] <%griffball13> GOBLINS
[1:07:49] <%MrBorisMakarov> oh no
[1:07:52] <Blank9> Scaling
[1:07:56] <+Jontman42> Because the damage increments aren't always the same
[1:07:56] <+xBolts4Lifex> I'm so happy we got another nioh
[1:07:56] <TonberryLives> MANY STAT
[1:07:56] <crimsonsaens> Look at all that weapon
[1:07:58] <sonofthedeepsouth> GOBLIN PAT
[1:07:59] <heartlesshealer> Yeah pat, it said in the choice area?
[1:07:59] <%dalmek> there's THREE scaling stats
[1:08:00] <%Typhaeon> Looks like three stats
[1:08:00] <%Axellogic> No magic is B
[1:08:01] <Finakala> DEX BUILD
[1:08:02] <%xUmbraNinja> psaGoblin
[1:08:04] <DamnGoodCake> yea, its menu hell
[1:08:05] <%derap41> Told you Magic is for magic
[1:08:06] <+EmotionalFatGuy> you have to learn spells to cast magic. better to put points into ki or weapon dmg
[1:08:09] <%CommanderSqueaks> psaGoblin psaGoblin psaGoblin psaGoblin psaGoblin psaGoblin IT BEGINS
[1:08:12] <Djinnazz> Yor AXES are skill
[1:08:13] <%GeneralSCPatton> My first point of strength was worse for odachi than stamina. Math is finicky.
[1:08:14] <%BoomerUnchained> psaWhat psaWhat
[1:08:15] <snake_zen> there are three stats pat
[1:08:15] <+Pookiedaexzile> Gorbrorins
[1:08:19] <%J_Papa> I see they made the game more accessible than before
[1:08:20] <JerZeyCJ> You have straight up better versions of your weapons in the inventory
[1:08:24] <%GabeSweetMan> It begins.
[1:08:25] <%TheGreatSkenardo> Oh I've seen this one. You have to do the jutsus
[1:08:26] <tusk102> @PatStaresAt glaive is magic
[1:08:27] <heartlesshealer> just learn icons
[1:08:30] <%CommanderSqueaks> "Wa-what- B+"
[1:08:34] <+secretspud> magics real good this time around
[1:08:34] <+hawk_rush> you should juice magic and skill
[1:08:34] <$RealThiele> number. . . go. . . error
[1:08:36] <%Reaped_Psyche> That's why the hatchets return to your hands. MAAAAAAGIC!
[1:08:38] <%Axellogic> Constitution also gives you health though
[1:08:39] <heartlesshealer> trick weapons are magic
[1:08:40] <%AncelDeLambert> LUL and we have already reached the point at which I would give up
[1:08:40] <%trekkie11041> onmyo skills are super dope
[1:08:43] <%valriot> @PatStaresAt Magic, Skill and Constitution are your go to for this
[1:08:43] <$rooooooooooot> gj pat
[1:08:44] <%GabeSweetMan> I've always felt the same as Pat on this. There's SO MANY mechanics to juggle.
[1:08:45] <qu3kl41n_the_impure_king> magic become critical for high end stuff, SLOTH TALISMAN IS GOD
[1:08:45] <+Pookiedaexzile> You level cucked
[1:08:45] <bluefooddye1> Scaling doesn't matter for shit at level 2
[1:08:49] <$rooooooooooot> playthru ruined
[1:08:49] <+secretspud> you just gotta use rice to level it at this level
[1:08:51] <GUNxSPECTRE> And the best part: Nioh said FUCK OFF TO DURABILITY

[1:12:48] <%patriotrenegade> no u couldnt
[1:12:49] <ShopperKung> now i wonder Pat gonna play this game like DSP that only use Mid stand or not haha
[1:12:50] <+nekodelic> COWARD
[1:12:55] <Thalchampz> uh god i thought it was here
[1:12:55] <%Typhaeon> Sick dodges
[1:12:57] <EuropanLamprey> This truly is Dark Souls
[1:12:59] <DatAsuna> this music is real solid
[1:13:00] <Strider222> you do so much damage
[1:13:01] <+hawk_rush> WHIFFED
[1:13:01] <%GabeSweetMan> THAT TRACKING IS BULLSHIT
[1:13:03] <%superc37> No, I could do it, you cannot
[1:13:03] <%darcfowler1995> Quickly page show him your boobs to distract him
[1:13:06] <%patriotrenegade> ill donate $20 if you beat him
[1:13:07] <%GabeSweetMan> DID YOU SEE HOW LATE THAT TRACKED?
[1:13:08] <%Typhaeon> Almost got him winded
[1:13:14] <%logoth_> The hill seems to fuck with his attack hitbox
[1:13:14] <$floralkami> Paige what did you just unplug?
[1:13:15] <+Pookiedaexzile> WHy do you dodge towards the club of death
[1:13:15] <%KishinGrek> Its that weird bull demon with the cursed backstory
[1:13:19] <+Pookiedaexzile> also moooooooo
[1:13:20] <sonofthedeepsouth> Bull Satsui No hadi
[1:13:27] <$rooooooooooot> ?
[1:13:29] <Dragon_Batman> It also depends on the stance
[1:13:34] <Jetsfantasy> DS2 levels of tracking, huh?
[1:13:40] <haisho> oh I thought something randomly unplugged on my end so it was Pat's stream huh
[1:13:46] <$rooooooooooot> same
[1:13:49] <qu3kl41n_the_impure_king> dodging was always way more reliable, also your block vs physical is always 100% regardless of weapon, unless that was changed
[1:13:55] <%patriotrenegade> he sure i
[1:13:56] <DamnGoodCake> Can you magic form yet?
[1:13:57] <+hawk_rush> yeeeee
[1:13:58] <%derekwst3> did you know these were in ancient japan many years ago but went extinct after the samurai arrived
[1:14:00] <Jetsfantasy> Though I will say SourPls
[1:14:00] <$rooooooooooot> ah yes jermaIQ
[1:14:02] <%mrjplays2k9> aris legit fought this guy for like an hour atpGasm
[1:14:04] <EuropanLamprey> Ninja Art: Circle Strafing no Jutsu!
[1:14:04] <chambatron> You're doing better than max keep at it
[1:14:06] <%foreverN2dust> go big and stay home
[1:14:08] <%derap41> @Jetsfantasy Twitch dodging is a much bigger part of this so the tracking isn't so bad
[1:14:11] <Blank9> You can sprint all directions while locked on, tracking can't keep up with sprint
[1:14:15] <%KishinGrek> Henshin!
[1:14:18] <fattyboy067> @Jetsfantasy but he's not spinning in place?
[1:14:22] <%thecasket> God that tracking
[1:14:25] <Dragon_Batman> Nice to see their Ki is still their poise
[1:14:27] <%AncelDeLambert> eat a dick, Gyuumao
[1:14:28] <%superc37> wait rly? only took me like 30 min
[1:14:31] <TheTunnelSn8ke> This guy is leading his swings real good
[1:14:35] <$lotharrio> Bullhead? Isn't he supposed to be in hell?
[1:14:38] <%Axellogic> When the enemy glows red and you hear the explosion noise you can use R1+O to burst counter his attack
[1:14:40] <chaos2frozen> he's not taking advantage of the no ki state
[1:14:42] <Skeletonmanners> you can double tap dodge to roll
[1:14:50] <%GabeSweetMan> Yeah I noticed that. He tracks right up until it's 1 mm from your head.
[1:14:50] <%Parapattern> How much health does this guy have?
[1:14:55] <%AncelDeLambert> overtracking is a massive problem in games, and should ALWAYS be watched out for during development
[1:14:58] <+KawaiiJetty> not much
[1:14:58] <%derekwst3> drop your shields
[1:14:59] <$rooooooooooot> monkaS
[1:14:59] <%PinkSuprende> He's got Phantom on it's not immediate like brute
[1:15:04] <%Typhaeon> He's not so tough
[1:15:07] <%superc37> @parapattern as much as the boss version
[1:15:07] <%thecasket> @Parapattern I think he's meant to be a mini-boss you run from
[1:15:09] <stormhawk9891> @Axellogic He knows he justs sucks at parries in general
[1:15:09] <%xeros720> boss health
[1:15:09] <+Pookiedaexzile> you also have axes
[1:15:11] <%xUmbraNinja> psaDab psaDab psaDab
[1:15:13] <%PinkSuprende> Brute you interrupt, Phantom and Feral you need to eat the hit
[1:15:19] <%Axellogic> The windows are super lenient
[1:15:21] <%KishinGrek> psaMenace psaMenace psaMenace psaMenace psaMenace psaMenace psaMenace psaMenace
[1:15:23] <%AncelDeLambert> oh he tired
[1:15:24] <karl_rex> Those bloodstains are really distracting
[1:15:25] <%trekkie11041> @Parapattern hes a boss level enemy
[1:15:27] <Ipsenscastle> he's no Glaivemaster Hodir
[1:15:28] <+Pookiedaexzile> you have axes
[1:15:29] <%derekwst3> what would obama say
[1:15:33] <%J_Papa> Does he have 2 ki bars? What's that about?
[1:15:37] <heartlesshealer> ALMOST

[1:15:40] <%Reaped_Psyche> Super close
[1:15:40] <stormhawk9891> Doable
[1:15:40] <%Axellogic> Some bosses will be nigh impossible if you dont counter

[1:15:41] <%neVan0> OOF
[1:15:41] <Ipsenscastle> F
[1:15:42] <+EmotionalFatGuy> good try
[1:15:42] <LoneO7> dont forget to parry you fucking casual
[1:15:42] <snake_zen> pat that is literally a boss later in the game
[1:15:43] <qu3kl41n_the_impure_king> GREED
[1:15:43] <sonofthedeepsouth> LUL
[1:15:43] <%CommanderSqueaks> @patriotrenegade I was about to call you out.
[1:15:43] <%faronmcsalty> Damn, very good attempt tho!
[1:15:43] <$rooooooooooot> you can do it though
[1:15:43] <coldfire0007> counter
[1:15:46] <+Zutrax> He's very doable.
[1:15:46] <TonberryLives> BETTER THAN MY FIRST TRY
[1:15:46] <+secretspud> R2+O on Red Flash
[1:15:46] <haisho> burst counter
[1:15:46] <TheTunnelSn8ke> Almost had 'em
[1:15:49] <vvitchguy> WOO!
[1:15:49] <%derekwst3> 1
[1:15:49] <Monkeyweed21> you need to counter
[1:15:50] <heartlesshealer> something about red flash
[1:15:51] <Tucker0603> counters
[1:15:51] <%xUmbraNinja> R1 0
[1:15:52] <+HouseofNonsense> Some of these hitboxes are real fucky, tho it seems like they're helping more often than not
[1:15:52] <%derap41> Nioh was always about timing Dodges rather than positioning
[1:15:52] <+stellarseeker> that was close
[1:15:53] <%PinkSuprende> Third bar is your Yokai moves/burst counter
[1:15:53] <%WhereIsWill> kill him for goodies
[1:15:54] <%KishinGrek> Good try
[1:15:54] <SLVRBAKSLPZ> Got greedy
[1:15:54] <%superc37> @j_papa purple is the Mana bar for yokai abilities
[1:15:54] <DXLelouch24> got greedy
[1:15:55] <chaos2frozen> @PatStaresAt When the enemy has no ki
[1:15:55] <orangerainbow> so no one gonna tell him that's the boss of the level
[1:15:56] <%trekkie11041> @PatStaresAt dont forget the burst counter
[1:15:57] <toyforus235> devil trigger counter
[1:16:00] <+Pookiedaexzile> Yeah Texas
[1:16:00] <%darcfowler1995> Damn it got too greedy man
[1:16:01] <+CelticFrost70> burst counter during red flash
[1:16:03] <heartlesshealer> Remember using it eats one purple
[1:16:04] <%KishinGrek> The grab state
[1:16:04] <+hawk_rush> and devil trigger in general
[1:16:04] <%HunguyTV> parry makes him trivial
[1:16:04] <%Valentinius_Anodyne> Try using your head, like the boss psaSmug
[1:16:06] <vVAstrAVv> pat when demons are out of ki GO IN
[1:16:08] <%patriotrenegade> wait until his second form
[1:16:12] <+Pookiedaexzile> Anyone can take adantage of texas
[1:16:13] <DamnGoodCake> yeah yeah yeah
[1:16:14] <%xeros720> 2nd bar is yokai bar or something, you need it for yokai moves
[1:16:14] <LoneO7> he has already forgotten, this is going to be the worst stream
[1:16:17] <%valriot> Also whn theyre out of KI, you can just go ham and stagger them
[1:16:17] <Dragon_Batman> As well as when they lose all Ki
[1:16:18] <%KishinGrek> Minsd goblin
[1:16:19] <TheTunnelSn8ke> Get Sharknado on his Kobe beef ass
[1:16:20] <crimsonsaens> You can stunlock yokai when they have no ki
[1:16:22] <%GeneralSCPatton> FUCK THEM WHEN KI EMPTY
[1:16:23] <trianglehat> Hi Paige

[1:17:36] <coldfire0007> And learning is half the battle!
[1:17:36] <Ipsenscastle> more like DED talk
[1:17:37] <%valriot> Your meter fills up when hitting an enemy and purifying yokai spots
[1:17:47] <%GabeSweetMan> Wasn't there a mechanic to have the spirit abandon your souls to get it back?
[1:17:47] <snake_zen> pat why not sneak around the big man
[1:17:48] <7th_JusticeFlame> Hows the game
[1:17:49] <%KishinGrek> Just 1 clap
[1:17:49] <%MelBrooksKA> I've seen worse ted talks
[1:17:52] <Monkeyweed21> AngriestPat would have won by now
[1:17:53] <%Typhaeon> Pretty much Asylum Demon
[1:17:54] <%rytyoung> Ohh noo I've missed many yokai beating Pat up!
[1:17:55] <chambatron> It's optional btw
[1:17:56] <heartlesshealer> dodged too soon
[1:17:56] <%patriotrenegade> squish
[1:17:57] <vVAstrAVv> the loading music is so witchery
[1:17:58] <bluefooddye1> That music is way worse than the first's somber flute
[1:17:59] <%darcfowler1995> This game looks so fucking good
[1:18:06] <+Jontman42> Every soulslike should start with a Gundyr
[1:18:06] <heartlesshealer> rocks?
[1:18:07] <%derap41> Its like that Demon souls first boss or Dark souls first boss
[1:18:10] <%mrjplays2k9> FOR SOME GOOD NEWS, DISNEY JUST HALTED PRODUCTION ON ALL OF ITS LIVE ACTION MOVIES
[1:18:11] <%PinkSuprende> The timing for Phantom counters is very slim
[1:18:14] <%thecasket> @rytyoung This is the second enemy so don't worry
[1:18:20] <duende667> you can just sneak around it lol
[1:18:21] <+thelonechris> Heh
[1:18:21] <%Typhaeon> Gottem
[1:18:25] <stabbityrabbit> This might be a low stance situation. Since blocking is getting Pat nowhere.
[1:18:27] <Dragon_Batman> Nice
[1:18:29] <%dalmek> You can transform btw
[1:18:29] <%KishinGrek> Angery moo
[1:18:30] <%derap41> @mrjplays2k9 Thank god
[1:18:30] <Monkeyweed21> USE DT
[1:18:36] <+hawk_rush> attack the horns, it'll stagger him more
[1:18:37] <%Axellogic> If theres one video game ive come to understand its this thing
[1:18:37] <%darcfowler1995> The dark souls three immediate boss is a great barrier to entry and I hope that they keep on doing it
[1:18:39] <+EmotionalFatGuy> One could say "this is BULLshit"
[1:18:42] <Monkeyweed21> DT PAT
[1:18:44] <+Crimznking> Ushi Oni?

[1:18:47] <qu3kl41n_the_impure_king> go in
[1:18:49] <%GabeSweetMan> For how big that weapon it, I'm not feeling the weight or HEFT of it in how fast he's swinging it around.
[1:18:51] <%Axellogic> See the counter super helps

[1:19:00] <%xeros720> he was in a stun state
[1:19:02] <$Dioliciouss> @PatStaresAt you can do this, defeat Laurance-chan
[1:19:02] <Archmortal> it gives you a bunch of time to attack
[1:19:02] <%xUmbraNinja> 5
[1:19:02] <Monkeyweed21> USE DT
[1:19:02] <%Axellogic> Counter damages and stuns
[1:19:04] <%dmtjinni> F
[1:19:08] <fattyboy067> it's his stamina
[1:19:08] <+Pookiedaexzile> You hve
[1:19:09] <stormhawk9891> @PatStaresAt Yokai ki is poise
[1:19:09] <%GabeSweetMan> That club should be heavier than Gozuki himself.
[1:19:09] <%KishinGrek> F
[1:19:11] <%CommanderSqueaks> Bang bang bang, pull my devil trigger
[1:19:14] <%darcfowler1995> Well to be fair he is a gigantic motherfucker
[1:19:15] <+Pookiedaexzile> AXES
[1:19:18] <lightninglord> When he's out of ki, he loses super armor. That move refreshes his ki.
[1:19:18] <Damie904> Why is Pat not healing?
[1:19:19] <+hawk_rush> easy mode is now selectable
[1:19:20] <LoneO7> top left marble will glow when DT is ready
[1:19:20] <Monkeyweed21> counter gives lots of DT meter
[1:19:21] <%linkster291> Creates tainted land where your stamina drops quickly. Do the Ki refill to get rid of it.
[1:19:21] <%KishinGrek> Henshin
[1:19:24] <vVAstrAVv> nice not healing
[1:19:25] <stabbityrabbit> Low stance and dodge.
[1:19:27] <%DensityD> happy friday the 13th
[1:19:28] <Josef_Stryker> RIP
[1:19:29] <JerZeyCJ> When his bar is blinking red and he's crouched, you can grapple him. Get in close and don't mash triangle
[1:19:31] <artoflec> the fast load times and everything imo, make this big guy fun to just practice how to play
[1:19:32] <Dragon_Batman> Can you break his horns? In the first one you could break their horns, usually with High stance cuz of height difference.
[1:19:33] <%Faustgesicht> Music's pretty solid. Not as good as nioh ones
[1:19:33] <coldfire0007> You have a skill point
[1:19:33] <+Jontman42> low stance for better dodges
[1:19:36] <%Axellogic> Gozuki has a shitton of defense for your starter gear though
[1:19:39] <snake_zen> pat you do not need to fight him but you can
[1:19:42] <heartlesshealer> I think Pat's not healing because he's trying to learn timings?
[1:19:44] <%fetrigon> @monkeyweed21 You know he's not doing it just to spite you right?
[1:19:47] <LazyLudens> @Dragon_Batman you can
[1:19:48] <heartlesshealer> YUP
[1:19:49] <qu3kl41n_the_impure_king> when they are out of stamina, they can be easily stunlocked, transform for big damage
[1:19:51] <RubberFistFight> @PatStaresAt fuck I missed the start. How's it going so far? I burned out on Nioh 1 for partially the same reasons you did, so I'm kinda interested to see what's different this time round.
[1:19:58] <%GabeSweetMan> This shit is back??
[1:19:58] <lightninglord> Press the attack when he's out of ki, your attacks will stagger him then.

[1:22:15] <%CommanderSqueaks> ROOOOLL TO THE RIGHT
[1:22:17] <LoneO7> use the fucking devil trigger
[1:22:17] <BoneBagMel> block is super good in nioh
[1:22:18] <+Pookiedaexzile> You aren't that invincible
[1:22:18] <%Maids4lyfe> just get good and stop dying
[1:22:18] <Monkeyweed21> THE GOBLINS HAVE AWOKEN
[1:22:18] <+Kurvera> F
[1:22:20] <%darcfowler1995> Never mind Elmo came to shit on you
[1:22:20] <+EySoyCoco> seems rough for the 2nd enemy in the game
[1:22:21] <%Valentinius_Anodyne> Why aren't you blocking
[1:22:23] <orangerainbow> running is a legit strategy
[1:22:24] <%SaphronBlackbourne> BANG BANG BANG PULL MY DEVIL TRIGGER
[1:22:24] <+scrumbotime> how is pat going to feel when he finds out you can just run past the guy
[1:22:25] <zmuno> Game of the Year!!!
[1:22:25] <sonofthedeepsouth> F
[1:22:25] <heartlesshealer> run from tackle
[1:22:25] <%valriot> Remember you have better dodges in lower stances
[1:22:25] <+stellarseeker> This isn't even a boss
[1:22:26] <Djinnazz> it actually is
[1:22:27] <BoneBagMel> try it my dude, try blocking
[1:22:28] <%derap41> Blocking is only for light enemies
[1:22:28] <%Typhaeon> That seems like Dark Souls talking
[1:22:29] <+Jontman42> He doesn't have a boss health bar so you can probably just run
[1:22:31] <%dmtjinni> DT
[1:22:31] <%J_Papa> It took me forever to rewire my habit of dodging out of combos to blocking in Nioh
[1:22:31] <snake_zen> pat just skip the fight
[1:22:32] <+textandnumbers> has pat unlocked easy mode yet?
[1:22:32] <Tucker0603> THEN WHY YOU DIE
[1:22:33] <sonofthedeepsouth> BUT IT IS PAT
[1:22:35] <tusk102> @PatStaresAt blocking works....
[1:22:35] <%darcfowler1995> Put up your fucking shield
[1:22:36] <Ipsenscastle> are there parries?
[1:22:38] <sonofthedeepsouth> BLOCK U FCK
[1:22:40] <+EySoyCoco> oh look, solaire soup
[1:22:40] <Reanimator83> Hand the controller over to Paige
[1:22:41] <orangerainbow> youd be suprised at how good the block is
[1:22:42] <%xUmbraNinja> No snake
[1:22:42] <StarlitStunner> stripSad Pat dead
[1:22:42] <LazyLudens> imagine if in Bloodborne, when you respawned, you'd be given 10 blood vials if you had none
[1:22:43] <TonberryLives> It'll blast through your KI but it WILL take a hit
[1:22:43] <%Axellogic> You dont have to fight Gozuki he's just there to be a big dick contest
[1:22:44] <stabbityrabbit> Low stance and dodging is the solution.
[1:22:45] <%mrjplays2k9> elmos gonna do a big pee on the floor
[1:22:46] <JerZeyCJ> Maybe try equipping that fancy preorder armor and weapon's you got?
[1:22:47] <%GarbageNirvana> ***
[1:22:47] <fattyboy067> you can get hit by the first hit of the charge which doesn't do a lot of damage, and block the second big hit
[1:22:50] <%darcfowler1995> Oh this is going to be the opposite of woolly bullshit
[1:22:51] <stormhawk9891> @PatStaresAt Totally can block it as long as you have stamina
[1:22:54] <BoneBagMel> blocking negates damage, it doesn't lower it. it flat out 0-es damage
[1:22:55] <+Pookiedaexzile> axeshave more dps
[1:23:01] <%Agami23> break his horns like the punk he is
[1:23:02] <RubberFistFight> @PatStaresAt man that was almost word-for-word a tip from the original Mortal Kombat, Reptile would drop in from the top of the screen and say "Blocking will get you nowhere."

[1:23:23] <%GarbageQueenEllie> Stando Powah
[1:23:27] <artoflec> did a ton of ki damage
[1:23:28] <%logoth_> Doesnt Nioh have visceral attacks for when their stamina bar fills
[1:23:30] <+hawk_rush> to me, high stance looks like the best to get the horns damaged
[1:23:31] <heartlesshealer> you still get to have purple bar
[1:23:32] <%Ascethetic> yo chat, what game officially started the 'sphere grid' skill tree? or was FFX the first?

[1:24:43] <TheTunnelSn8ke> Blocking that horn charge = bad idea
[1:24:43] <%patriotrenegade> shouldnt your hitbox be smaller
[1:24:44] <StarlitStunner> stripD1 stripD2
[1:24:44] <Dr_Mooose> that's how it always is
[1:24:45] <BoneBagMel> you can do it, it is allowed

[1:26:49] <%MrBorisMakarov> ki and hp
[1:26:52] <+secretspud> purple bar is stamina
[1:26:52] <%mrjplays2k9> stamina and stagger
[1:26:54] <%dmtjinni> Pat..........
[1:26:56] <%GabeSweetMan> I'm also unclear on those...
[1:26:56] <BoneBagMel> seccond bar is poise / stamina
[1:26:56] <%trekkie11041> ONES STAMINA PAT
[1:26:57] <+EmotionalFatGuy> HP and STAM
[1:26:57] <tusk102> @PatStaresAt one is stagger and one is stamina.
[1:26:59] <+hawk_rush> one is his poise
[1:27:03] <BoneBagMel> oh
[1:27:08] <BoneBagMel> that's new
[1:27:10] <%mrjplays2k9> F
[1:27:10] <%Axellogic> His max ki is lowered
[1:27:13] <%thecasket> The second red bar is him losing his max KI
[1:27:13] <+nekodelic> max ki
[1:27:13] <%PinkSuprende> Think Sekiro, you damage his max ki
[1:27:16] <%trekkie11041> YOUR LOWERING HIS MAX
[1:27:16] <DatAsuna> @PatStaresAt You can stunlock him when it's empty
[1:27:17] <%MrBorisMakarov> stam degrades as he gets damaged @PatStaresAt
[1:27:17] <chaos2frozen> maximum ki
[1:27:18] <%KishinGrek> Ow
[1:27:19] <fattyboy067> maximum stamina he can regenerate, makes it easier and easier to break it, you can get an execute at 0 maximum ki
[1:27:19] <artoflec> @PatStaresAt You are capping off his maximum KI, the little white tick can be lowered all the way too.
[1:27:20] <+lethallylactic> monkaS
[1:27:20] <%TheMattman1313> HP Damage = Lowered Max Ki
[1:27:21] <%GabeSweetMan> It's so TINY it's readability is fucking impossible.
[1:27:23] <Dragon_Batman> Oh they seperated ki and poise?
[1:27:24] <coracor> how are you alive
[1:27:27] <%GeneralSCPatton> DAMAGE DEBUFFS MAX KI
[1:27:28] <$lotharrio> Pffft.
[1:27:31] <%Parapattern> Ker-Splat
[1:27:36] <%PinkSuprende> Poise has always been a seperate stat called Toughness
[1:27:37] <+hawk_rush> maybe try DT'ing when its out of ki
[1:27:42] <+hawk_rush> to do the max damage
[1:27:42] <%mrjplays2k9> greedy
[1:27:46] <%xeros720> that's cool, in nioh 1 enemies would regen ki quick
[1:27:47] <%TheWinged7> mortis

[1:27:48] <%GarbageQueenEllie> Imagine trying to do this boss with fucking TONFA
[1:27:49] <+Jontman42> DT parries seem to reduce his max ki

[1:27:51] <$rooooooooooot> that was lame
[1:27:51] <%jackythefrost> @PatStaresAt If the red part of his ki fills all the way he getts staggered for a few seconds
[1:27:51] <BoneBagMel> that was bs
[1:27:51] <LoneO7> kill this bastard
[1:27:51] <tusk102> @hawk_rush his dt bar isn't full

[1:27:57] <%TheNewJapanGuy> Boomer Removed
[1:27:58] <TheTunnelSn8ke> Aww, that was a bullshit track
[1:27:59] <snake_zen> the red decreases his max ki and when fully drained you can do a grapple move
[1:28:00] <heartlesshealer> one is probably a stagger bar or something
[1:28:01] <nuane> on a dime
[1:28:02] <Tucker0603> man i love the hatchets weapon
[1:28:02] <%WhereIsWill> yea he can bust a 180 on that

[1:28:29] <+jbfelder> F
[1:28:29] <%HunguyTV> low stance has better dodge
[1:28:30] <%GeneralSCPatton> The two bars are damage debuffing his max ki
[1:28:31] <awalr> they way he just hard rotates on the spot with zero momentum on the club scraping the ground cracks me up
[1:28:33] <+scrumbotime> pat please, please run so you can actually play and come back for that guy when you aren't using Tutorial Weapons
[1:28:41] <%derap41> @heartlesshealer Damage bonus for unsing the same weapons for a long time

[1:29:04] <BoneBagMel> you heal when u parry?
[1:29:14] <$floralkami> is there no way to juke the tracking?
[1:29:14] <%Garthunox> Pat this is Asylum Demon, you're meant to run!
[1:29:15] <Animorphimagi> this is why NIOH 2 is worse than Nioh 1
[1:29:15] <taquito_blade> Pat run you cant kill the starter bull thing without help
[1:29:20] <%thecasket> Aren't the elixirs in Nioh 2 finite?
[1:29:23] <%R3Roundabout> Just walk past and return with real gear for revenge
[1:29:24] <%patriotrenegade> you could just not fight him and run away like a big coward
[1:29:24] <%J_Papa> Remember how important blocking was in Nioh 1? It was imperative for you to forget your Dark Souls habit of dodging everything
[1:29:24] <%GabeSweetMan> Yo skill point
[1:29:25] <sexdrugsvideogames> its not your fault, chat says your weapon is shit
[1:29:26] <heartlesshealer> Earned a skillpoint

[1:31:11] <Animorphimagi> @fattyboy067 because the game doesn't tell you that it's too hard to do right now and later bosses are pretty much impossible without grinding. I know Nioh had some of that too, but not to this amount
[1:31:11] <Dragon_Batman> The Yokai get black and white glowy bits for unblockables
[1:31:12] <ECRead> Grab beats block

[1:31:24] <+hawk_rush> there's timig
[1:31:25] <%Garthunox> you mash
[1:31:26] <snake_zen> it is when the lock on is red
[1:31:28] <%thecasket> You need to wait until his lock on symbol is red
[1:31:28] <%MalekDracarus> @GUNxSPECTRE yes
[1:31:30] <%derap41> @nuane some don't think he finished all of it
[1:31:35] <%HunguyTV> he starts recovering
[1:31:37] <crimsonsaens> Need red lock-on for grapple
[1:31:41] <fattyboy067> @Animorphimagi lmao what
[1:31:46] <%GeneralSCPatton> Lock-on needs to be red
[1:31:50] <%patriotrenegade> nope
[1:31:53] <tusk102> @PatStaresAt his lock on SYMBOL has to turn red to do the grab

[1:32:38] <DXLelouch24> MAX USED IT PAT, you just suck
[1:32:40] <+nekodelic> YOU USED IT
[1:32:41] <$lotharrio> Pat is Pat. That's Pat.
[1:32:41] <+kralec> @PatStaresAt you get two counters, a human one and a yokai one. Yokai one works on yokais, human one works on humans.
[1:32:43] <%jackythefrost> No the parry works fine for me on yokai
[1:32:47] <%GeneralSCPatton> Not doing it right

[1:33:14] <%juxtest> Theres the damage
[1:33:14] <%Muzzle131> that tracking is kind of bs
[1:33:16] <%RedKnightVI> I suppose this is one way to "ease" your players into your game
[1:33:17] <DamnGoodCake> BIG BOY = DODGE, SMALL BOY = BLOCK
[1:33:17] <+CelticFrost70> i didnt take damage! pat 2020

[1:33:23] <LoneO7> take a sip or monster and rethink your actions
[1:33:24] <+nogoodusernamesleft156> tracks too well. must dodge through
[1:33:24] <+Pookiedaexzile> Axes Chan was better to you
[1:33:24] <%wampa661> it's ok Pat, you'll get it
[1:33:27] <crimsonsaens> you'll be even with Max

[1:33:28] <%Garthunox> @xiangchang nope
[1:33:30] <%PaladinDupre> @PatStaresAt use the demon mode
[1:33:30] <YujinYo> ....
[1:33:31] <taquito_blade> Pat just run past it you cant kill it at your current level
[1:33:31] <nuane> it reduces a chunk of the boss's ki
[1:33:34] <tusk102> @PatStaresAt you have better weapons. switch off
[1:33:36] <+hawk_rush> the tracking takes some time to get used to
[1:33:37] <%patriotrenegade> Block his club with your face.
[1:33:38] <%superc37> @patstaresat pat you might wanna either ignore him or use the preorder gear since it's significantly better
[1:33:38] <bluefooddye1> That tracking is disgusting, this boss is literally made to be as unfair as possible
[1:33:38] <$rooooooooooot> no
[1:33:38] <heartlesshealer> stone x 1
[1:33:41] <tusk102> @PaladinDupre his dts not full

[1:33:51] <%optimasmaximas> so what's happened so far i just got back
[1:33:51] <%derap41> It would suck if you just started Playing Nioh 2 and just beat the shit out of it
[1:33:52] <%MayorRev> Just got here, how far is pat into the game
[1:33:58] <%NeroInfinite> Pop your devil trigger Lappa

[1:34:09] <+Jontman42> got the horns
[1:34:10] <RubberFistFight> @bluefooddye1 yeah welcome to Nioh bosses, the first game had this shit in spades too. A bit sad they leaned into it rather than make the bosses legitimately difficult.
[1:34:11] <xiccy> You don't have to fight him. run away!!! away!!!
[1:34:11] <tusk102> guys hes not gonna run past him he wants to beat the boss

[1:34:53] <stabbityrabbit> Cool, now see if Pat can do it in low stance.
[1:34:54] <taquito_blade> i fucking hate those angry red aura attacks!

[1:35:59] <%GabeSweetMan> Good parry!
[1:36:00] <%valriot> Its tracking, but you have to understand that your dodge is huge iframes, its basically a Platinum dodge
[1:36:02] <%BoomerUnchained> Pat, get gear and levels, please
[1:36:04] <%patriotrenegade> this is worse than when a NPC invader in Dark Souls II threw a Lightning Spear at me that turned 90 degrees when I sidestepped it
[1:36:08] <$floralkami> it literally STOPS ON A DIME after that first charge, is FUCKED
[1:36:08] <GUNxSPECTRE> Just learn the patterns, there's worse shit in DS3
[1:36:10] <ghostspartan80> this bull is pretty cool tho
[1:36:11] <%ZephynM> Your videos were really helpful to me some years ago and you got me into Sekiro. So I'm giving you my Prime as a thanks.
[1:36:12] <%dmtjinni> @weissguard LUL LUL
[1:36:12] <%thecasket> Maybe this should become a parry only run
[1:36:21] <tusk102> @BoomerUnchained he has better gear he just won't equip it

[1:36:37] <%BoomerUnchained> @tusk102 NotLikeThis
[1:36:39] <%Jaxnos> you're doing great
[1:36:41] <+Inferno_Icon> Moo motherfucker MOO bitterDab LUL
[1:36:41] <%코코꾸라> Ignore it and run away
[1:36:41] <heartlesshealer> no, it was a drop
[1:36:45] <$rooooooooooot> cheat xqcM
[1:36:45] <Sol_Install> they're shit
[1:36:45] <%GabeSweetMan> You've got the parry down though when you pull it off.
[1:36:47] <vVAstrAVv> remember pat. sword trick gun
[1:36:48] <$galaxyswirl> @GabeSweetMan not all stances are the same
[1:36:49] <Ipsenscastle> do it honest
[1:36:50] <DamnGoodCake> TIME TO CHEAT THEN?
[1:36:51] <+Pookiedaexzile> good
[1:36:52] <+hawk_rush> keep at it pat, you got this
[1:36:53] <heartlesshealer> This small dude dropped a headband
[1:36:53] <+SanityDrop> @PatStaresAt why is nioh 2 only ps4?
[1:36:54] <$floralkami> @gunxspectre at least in DS3, the mechanics are explained better
[1:36:54] <%MayorRev> maybe you should cheat 4Head
[1:36:54] <%afronooch> maybe summon the blue sword helper?
[1:36:55] <%HunguyTV> low stance
[1:36:56] <BoneBagMel> I respect the hustle
[1:36:59] <%Axellogic> They are not cheaty at all
[1:36:59] <%TIME_PUNCHER> Pat since when were you opposed to cheating
[1:37:00] <%Valentinius_Anodyne> They won't be cheaty for long, just use them
[1:37:03] <%GabeSweetMan> @galaxyswirl Is it only in low stance?
[1:37:05] <%valriot> Japan
[1:37:05] <+scrumbotime> Refuse to use better weapons, refuse to run past the Running Tutorial
[1:37:06] <%derap41> What are we without Bushido
[1:37:06] <%SaiyanShoto> He can beat it without leveling up or getting better gear, he’s got it
[1:37:07] <+Jontman42> Your shark
[1:37:09] <Monkeyweed21> PAT GRAVE
[1:37:09] <%코코꾸라> oh no
[1:37:11] <GUNxSPECTRE> What are the level on those Phantoms?
[1:37:11] <LoneO7> missed your spirit
[1:37:12] <%cvp5127> timed exclusive
[1:37:13] <DamnGoodCake> It's coming to PC in Nov
[1:37:13] <+hawk_rush> uh oh
[1:37:13] <Djinnazz> Ask Sony
[1:37:14] <%BoomerUnchained> Never not cheat
[1:37:14] <$rooooooooooot> they want people to double dip
[1:37:14] <%thecasket> Pat you gotta start lying, cheating and stealing
[1:37:14] <%derap41> PC in a couple months I think
[1:37:15] <+Dudealy> It's coming to PC in november
[1:37:16] <%haystacks89> because fuck yea exclusive
[1:37:16] <Grennold> Development support iirc
[1:37:16] <GUNxSPECTRE> They probably have better gear
[1:37:17] <heartlesshealer> bye fish
[1:37:17] <Sol_Install> the dlc weapons are for early levels
[1:37:18] <Dragon_Batman> Probably a sony deal
[1:37:18] <$lotharrio> Pat's anti-cheating stance is weirdly strong lately.
[1:37:19] <%Typhaeon> This cow demon doesn't know Bushido, only Bullshido
[1:37:20] <%Muzzle131> wasn't team ninja bought by Microsoft tho?
[1:37:23] <RubberFistFight> Wait it's PS4 only? I thought they were gonna do multiplatform?
[1:37:24] <YujinYo> 0/10 - pat cant beat this boss
[1:37:30] <vVAstrAVv> did that oni go "uwahahahah"
[1:37:33] <BoneBagMel> Y EY E YE YE
[1:37:33] <toyforus235> because PS player wants to flex at the xbox plaYER
[1:37:35] <Commander_Spyke> very nice pat
[1:37:36] <$galaxyswirl> @GabeSweetMan low has the best dodge, mid has the best block, high has the hardest hits
[1:37:39] <Grennold> The first Nioh was in development for like 14 years lmao
[1:37:40] <%MrBorisMakarov> i will admit pat IS getting better
[1:37:43] <Tucker0603> @PatStaresAt so i looked up the hatchets, they got some crazy combos
[1:37:43] <BoneBagMel> oh god it's so little damage
[1:37:44] <%valriot> @PatStaresAt Remember you do more damage from behind btw
[1:37:44] <%Typhaeon> Going IN seems to work
[1:37:44] <%ZephynM> Sony has the money to take exclusivity
[1:37:46] <%GarbageNirvana> Didn't Sony have a hand in publishing this one?
[1:37:46] <ghostspartan80> moo this you filthy casual
[1:37:47] <%TIME_PUNCHER> Pat is more anti cheat to maintain his processional demeanor
[1:37:48] <%derekwst3> @PatStaresAt do you need to give the controller to paige?
[1:37:50] <DamnGoodCake> @RubberFistFight it's coming to PC in Nov
[1:37:52] <+b1gboss007> @muzzle131 that was ninja theory, the ones that make Bad games
[1:37:53] <coracor> would high stance hit the horns? 🤔
[1:37:54] <Emaruse> The game is flat-out saying "Use The Counter" at this point
[1:37:55] <sexdrugsvideogames> what, he lost almost nothing!
[1:37:59] <%GabeSweetMan> @galaxyswirl Gotcha. So what factor do they play in parrying?
[1:38:02] <vVAstrAVv> at least uae high stance
[1:38:08] <+TheSaintJohn> yeyeyeye
[1:38:11] <brutalgenie> let paige beat him
[1:38:14] <Ipsenscastle> seems like the trick is to stay in
[1:38:16] <%BoomerUnchained> 'Angriest Pat' would've done it in maybe 5 tries
[1:38:17] <+nekodelic> Team Ninja may just ne not good at developing for PC, so they're probably outsourcing the port
[1:38:19] <%derap41> Getting better
[1:38:20] <%MrBorisMakarov> yeyeye
[1:38:24] <Grennold> ngl, i love the burst counter mechanic
[1:38:27] <nuane> all that for a drop of blood
[1:38:28] <%Typhaeon> Fuck him up!

[1:38:32] <%valriot> Yeah hes feelin it now, git that rhythm

[1:39:02] <Oxybe> Ah yes the Great Plateau Lynel fight. Max had a bit of a trouble with him too.
[1:39:03] <$galaxyswirl> @GabeSweetMan i think the parry has to do with what armor/ spirit you have
[1:39:04] <%thecasket> DEVIL TRIGGER
[1:39:05] <+Inferno_Icon> The preorder/dlc stuff gets outclassed numberswise by the end of this mission LUL

[1:40:07] <%derap41> @GabeSweetMan Its not about avoiding the attack its about timing I frames

[1:41:00] <tusk102> @PatStaresAt you do more damage from behind than you do in the front. Also horns are his weakpoint so use high stance
[1:41:00] <%TIME_PUNCHER> player deaths are the fault of the casket developer
[1:41:00] <Jarvanii> I just skipped this guy cause the tutorial for sprinting popped up so I figured it's best to not bother

[1:41:28] <%thecasket> I activated Crazy Talk as a second party
[1:41:30] <%xeros720> pat plays himself and blames One Guy
[1:41:30] <%preeeow> Cheer1000 just arrived. feeling like you'd recommend nioh 2?
[1:41:32] <%misha_kastrilevich> Minotaurs? In my Japanese games?
[1:41:34] <+Pookiedaexzile> mooooo
[1:41:35] <RubberFistFight> I dunno if I'm just stupid or blind but I'm having a REALLY hard time figuring out this boss's tells and stuff from watching this. It just seems random. Stuff is vacillating between working and not working all over the place and I just don't get it.
[1:41:39] <%strugglepunk2> Pat, maybe grab your souls and run back to the shrine for a level or three?
[1:41:56] <%shadylawyerman> I say you quit and play 14.
[1:42:02] <%derap41> @RubberFistFight since Pat doesn't seem to have an issue I'd say its you
[1:42:03] <DoughdBoy> Pat you dont need to fight him right now, you can litterally run past.
[1:42:10] <%MalekDracarus> Are heals still consumables in this game or are they like estus now?
[1:42:13] <%valriot> Your dodge is ass in High Stance
[1:42:13] <heartlesshealer> @preeeow I don't think he can say yet, he's fighting optional boss as seconf fight in the game
[1:42:14] <$rooooooooooot> the charging attack is the only shitty one
[1:42:18] <%damienlunas> I say you play World of Horror
[1:42:18] <fattyboy067> @RubberFistFight it's always the same thing, what do you mean
[1:42:18] <tusk102> @DoughdBoy no he needs to fight him bc goblin
[1:42:19] <%R3Roundabout> This boss has a lot of bad tells
[1:42:21] <%GeneralSCPatton> @shadylawyerman FUCK YOU AND EVERYONE YOU KNOW
[1:42:25] <%dmtjinni> HEAL
[1:42:29] <%Typhaeon> High seems very effective in terms of not only poise damage but raw output to stamina regen
[1:42:32] <YujinYo> Change characters to honoka or marie rose
[1:42:35] <sexdrugsvideogames> heal
[1:42:36] <$rooooooooooot> the charge needs a better tell lol
[1:42:37] <heartlesshealer> He has no more healing juice!
[1:42:41] <%dmtjinni> F
[1:42:41] <%WhereIsWill> that charge is busted
[1:42:43] <%MrBorisMakarov> no heals
[1:42:43] <Ipsenscastle> @RubberFistFight there's a pattern, the muddy lighting does make things a bit unclear though
[1:42:44] <%derap41> 17
[1:42:44] <BoneBagMel> no more heals
[1:42:44] <nuane> JUST
[1:42:45] <Firemahci> Pat, hit the back, 150% damage
[1:42:46] <krabthecrab> Maybe Tetris is more your speed, Patrick?
[1:42:46] <%ZephynM> This looks tough
[1:42:47] <%MrBorisMakarov> he only has 3 guys
[1:42:48] <%strugglepunk2> Pat, grab your souls and run back for a level
[1:42:49] <$invisi_bliss> how's the game so far?
[1:42:49] <Khorneflakes_> Kappa
[1:42:50] <Monkeyweed21> AngriestPat would have won by now
[1:42:50] <%MrBorisMakarov> CRAZY TALK
[1:42:50] <%valriot> @PatStaresAt Try not to dodge in High Stance
[1:42:51] <Dragon_Batman> You might just need to run past
[1:42:51] <+secretspud> Roll through the charge
[1:42:51] <$floralkami> bruh, there is NO cooldown between those charges
[1:42:51] <%WhereIsWill> we believe!
[1:42:52] <%GarbageQueenEllie> aaaaaAHHHHheeyheeeyahaaa

[1:43:01] <%Valentinius_Anodyne> psaCrazyhand psaCrazyhead
[1:43:02] <%HunguyTV> Try low stance till you get parry
[1:43:05] <xIgnitionCrowx> can you feel it mr. krabs?
[1:43:06] <MrGremy> its easier after you beat this zones boss
[1:43:07] <%xeros720> he pads the ground witn his foot before a charge
[1:43:08] <Grennold> TEH URN BOYZ
[1:43:09] <%shadylawyerman> @GeneralSCPatton psaMenace psaSmug psaSmug
[1:43:10] <%GabeSweetMan> Oh hitting them in the back does higher damage? I guess that makes sense. Where does the game tell you that?
[1:43:12] <Jarvanii> how to burn out: a guide by pat
[1:43:15] <heartlesshealer> a NON PREORDER headgear has been obtained
[1:43:16] <%Spaghetto_Godfather> I'm enjoying this game a lot
[1:43:18] <stabbityrabbit> That has to be Crazy Talk, because he still isn't using low stance.
[1:43:19] <RubberFistFight> I would rather fight the Demon of Hatred than this fucking shit.
[1:43:20] <+alseif5633> Maybe try to summon someone?
[1:43:20] <%Jaxnos> Jaxnos subscribed at Tier 1. They've subscribed for 14 months! you're doing great Pat you've only died a lot to this big oxen man. Which is less than often! skeyCOOL
[1:43:20] <$rooooooooooot> yikes
[1:43:20] <%R3Roundabout> I enjoy Pat suffering for our amusement, but I want to see more diverse forms of suffering. Fucked by a minotaur is played out
[1:43:24] <%darcfowler1995> Pat smack that ass
[1:43:25] <frostech8> Its the next one
[1:43:26] <stormhawk9891> @invisi_bliss He's still on the 2nd enemy in the game

[1:43:36] <fattyboy067> I think they mean the speed demon parry
[1:43:39] <Oxybe> This is the Great Plateau Lynel figth. Sure you can run... but what kind of chicken does that?
[1:43:40] <%superc37> Pat just run away and use those souls for levels ffs
[1:43:43] <+PE4X> it does big Ki damage
[1:43:43] <YujinYo> Pat you can do it buddy
[1:43:44] <$invisi_bliss> looks pretty dope, never really got into nioh PogChamp
[1:43:45] <%GarbageQueenEllie> You'll NEVER defeat the Dingo!
[1:43:47] <%michingmallecho> Do combo
[1:43:49] <%thecasket> Brute has the best parry because you can use it the second you see the red aura instead of waiting to parry
[1:43:51] <bluefooddye1> Low is for dodging, mid is for guarding

[1:44:01] <%BoomerUnchained> 'tis the one
[1:44:01] <heartlesshealer> dodged into an accidental wall

[1:44:01] <superraccoon9> atpRtsd
[1:44:02] <%RedKnightVI> Man this isn't even a boss
[1:44:03] <heartlesshealer> it's fine
[1:44:03] <%YakumoYomi> Guard in mid, dodge in low
[1:44:04] <%Beough> that charge is absurd
[1:44:04] <%strugglepunk2> Pat, go grab your souls and then run back and level
[1:44:08] <%Spaghetto_Godfather> you have to dash the charge
[1:44:08] <%darcfowler1995> Holy fucking fuck nugget Pat
[1:44:08] <+GenesisKnight> Hot damn
[1:44:10] <%GabeSweetMan> Does rolling into the charge give you enough I-frames?
[1:44:10] <%vectorless_peon> new best run
[1:44:11] <+Jontman42> @PatStaresAt you could cash in your amrita
[1:44:12] <nuane> oh you know he mad
[1:44:12] <LoneO7> you got another skill point
[1:44:13] <$invisi_bliss> @stormhawk9891 I see... LUL
[1:44:15] <%derap41> Dodge forward past it
[1:44:16] <TheTakkster> So is this the first boss
[1:44:16] <DJiNN_tw> Scuffed AF enigmaLUL enigmaLUL enigmaLUL enigmaLUL enigmaLUL enigmaLUL enigmaLUL
[1:44:20] <heartlesshealer> Any new skill points?
[1:44:20] <%PaladinDupre> @PatStaresAt do you have to beat him to progress?
[1:44:22] <DamnGoodCake> Pat have Paige do a single go, it'll make you BIG STRONG
[1:44:24] <LoneO7> you have one more point in glaives
[1:44:24] <%misha_kastrilevich> Someone get Paige in there
[1:44:25] <tusk102> @PatStaresAt get your souls and level up then fight him again
[1:44:27] <stabbityrabbit> @PatStaresAt Low stance has the best dodges. That's why you should use it since his attacks eat your stamina anyway.
[1:44:29] <snake_zen> @RedKnightVI it is a copy of a boss doh
[1:44:30] <Jarvanii> it's an optional tutorial boss basically
[1:44:31] <Reanimator83> The tracking is really bad
[1:44:32] <tusk102> @PaladinDupre no its goblin time
[1:44:33] <+scrumbotime> How many hours has he spent fighting the completely optional miniboss that he could come back to later with 0 levels?
[1:44:37] <%derap41> This is all about Bushido
[1:44:39] <Ipsenscastle> is there anything specific he's not doing/utilising?
[1:44:42] <%darcfowler1995> That doesn’t matter at this point it’s a matter of pride
[1:44:47] <%Typhaeon> This is a matter of gamer MANLINESS and PRIDE
[1:44:49] <%TheWinged7> psaBig psaGoblin
[1:44:50] <Oxybe> Great Plateu Lynel
[1:44:50] <+Jontman42> It's firmly in the realm of "doable" it has to be done
[1:44:50] <$Dakuu75> you need to beat him... for big-dick-energy and bragging rights

[1:44:54] <keiji_maede> BS

[1:44:55] <pixelkenj> skipping is no longer an option
[1:44:56] <%derap41> @Ipsenscastle not really its all timing
[1:44:56] <$floralkami> @scrumbotime it's only been 30 mins
[1:44:57] <heartlesshealer> dodged into a tree again
[1:44:58] <%xUmbraNinja> It’s about pride gayz
[1:44:59] <%foreverN2dust> To progress? No. To move on? Yes.
[1:45:00] <%ahdurian> wow this RE game looks great
[1:45:00] <%Conyst> Also second actual enemy
[1:45:02] <$lotharrio> He needs to beat him to get signed up for MLG.
[1:45:03] <+netrac> But my cost is so sunk right now
[1:45:03] <%RedKnightVI> That charge is fucked
[1:45:05] <%YakumoYomi> DT is ready. USE IT.
[1:45:06] <krabthecrab> It's just a boss meant to measure the size of the players pp
[1:45:10] <%thecasket> god that charge
[1:45:11] <heartlesshealer> dodged into graves...
[1:45:13] <$floralkami> BRUH
[1:45:13] <%darcfowler1995> Acquire the big dick energy Pat
[1:45:16] <%ZephynM> Sometimes you just really want to kill the thing. Got to prove something to yourself and all.
[1:45:25] <+Inferno_Icon> He still has another rare red attack thats bs
[1:45:25] <heartlesshealer> YES
[1:45:27] <%GabeSweetMan> Are you able to knock him OUT of the charge?
[1:45:27] <%valriot> @Ipsenscastle Mostly adjusting stances, mid is good for blocking, low is for dodging you get more iframes
[1:45:28] <heartlesshealer> YES PAT YOU RUN
[1:45:29] <%umbypokochan> Rooster Teeth said Pat has to beat this boss or they will fire him
[1:45:30] <$rooooooooooot> jermaIQ
[1:45:30] <+bluedude153> weapons look a lot more visually interesting this time around
[1:45:31] <Ipsenscastle> try to stay in close to minimise the amount of charging he does
[1:45:32] <Rellim80> Try to lead the Charging Bull into a tree for a stun.
[1:45:33] <+secretspud> Roll into
[1:45:34] <%derap41> The power of running away
[1:45:34] <+hawk_rush> running seems best
[1:45:36] <+Jontman42> Running away worked the best previously
[1:45:38] <+GenesisKnight> He's learning
[1:45:38] <%YakumoYomi> He's learning
[1:45:40] <Jarvanii> running has always been super strong in nioh
[1:45:43] <fattyboy067> you need to do the big backdowm
[1:45:47] <+hawk_rush> NICE
[1:45:48] <coracor> yeyeyeye
[1:45:48] <%Typhaeon> Immediately restunned, yeyeyye
[1:45:49] <%GarbageQueenEllie> Use your SECRET STREAMER TECHNIQUE

[1:45:50] <%GabeSweetMan> YEYEYEYE
[1:45:50] <$rooooooooooot> hell yeah

[1:45:53] <Ipsenscastle> @valriot interesting

[1:46:06] <%GabeSweetMan> USE THE JOESTAR FAMILY TECHNIQUE
[1:46:10] <Akett> PULL MY BUMBO TRIGGER!
[1:46:11] <%darcfowler1995> Yeah I get elbow deep in their pet
[1:46:12] <joey_jo_jo_juniorshabadoo> lmao half an hour on the first enemy
[1:46:16] <%GabeSweetMan> Too early
[1:46:23] <LoneO7> you can throw your weapon in DT
[1:46:25] <$rooooooooooot> second enemy technically
[1:46:26] <%Conyst> Use the ultimate JoJo technique Pat
[1:46:26] <%MrBorisMakarov> oh man
[1:46:26] <%derap41> 19
[1:46:27] <heartlesshealer> 👏👏 Good fish, but run from charge
[1:46:28] <%thecasket> Yo Pat you have a samurai skill point
[1:46:29] <BoneBagMel> time to run
[1:46:29] <%TheWinged7> m o r t i s
[1:46:30] <+Jontman42> @PatStaresAt Low is doding stance, Middle is blocking stance
[1:46:31] <%darcfowler1995> Well fuck damn spelling correction bullshit
[1:46:33] <BoneBagMel> or summon friend
[1:46:34] <tusk102> @PatStaresAt get your souls, and then sprint back and level up then fight him after you levelled up
[1:46:37] <%MrBorisMakarov> nah half an hour
[1:46:37] <+zetastriker> Try the roll, it has more i-frames than the dodge.
[1:46:37] <%xUmbraNinja> How fast did you do it Joey?
[1:46:38] <joey_jo_jo_juniorshabadoo> Yes
[1:46:38] <heartlesshealer> any new points?
[1:46:40] <%GabeSweetMan> !uptime
[1:46:40] <@Moobot> I've been playing this game for how long? Oh only 1h 46m.
[1:46:40] <%TheMattman1313> 2ND ENEMY THANK YOU
[1:46:41] <GUNxSPECTRE> Level up????????
[1:46:41] <+nekodelic> you were doing so good
[1:46:41] <%umbypokochan> that youtube thumbnail reaction is killing me lol
[1:46:42] <%ElkRiverDog> Are the yokai’s horns getting bigger every time he kills you?
[1:46:43] <%darcfowler1995> Getting fucked
[1:46:43] <%PaladinDupre> @Akett BUMBO CUMBO
[1:46:43] <RubberFistFight> 37 minutes since you went live
[1:46:43] <SubjectTea> still on this boss?
[1:46:45] <%thecasket> oh wait no
[1:46:46] <heartlesshealer> yeah more glaive
[1:46:48] <captainnathaniel> @patstaresat i know this is a bad time to say this, but cohhcarnage one shoted this guy
[1:46:49] <%Spydurman> Bring back RE6 Kappa
[1:46:51] <+McSoliace> max took a while too
[1:46:51] <RubberFistFight> oh wait
[1:46:52] <ECRead> 2nd enemy to be fair
[1:46:53] <sexdrugsvideogames> upgrade weapon?
[1:46:54] <ShopperKung> you can just run away but ok
[1:46:54] <%Spaghetto_Godfather> I had more trouble with the overheads when I fought him than the charge tbh
[1:46:54] <YujinYo> Is this better than sekiro
[1:46:55] <GuardMeShielder> Took me a while too.
[1:46:55] <LoneO7> throw the DT weapon at him to se how much it does
[1:46:56] <%thecasket> different skill point, I guess there's a generic icon
[1:46:58] <%derap41> !uptime
[1:46:58] <Grennold> I just ran past him LuL
[1:47:03] <heartlesshealer> glad you get these points so quickly, damn
[1:47:06] <%xUmbraNinja> Coward
[1:47:07] <Oxybe> First enemy is litterally a goblin
[1:47:08] <chaos2frozen> try dodging right to his overhead swing, i have more success there. also stay close to his ass @PatStaresAt
[1:47:10] <$rooooooooooot> it turns out that this hard boss is hard in this hard game
[1:47:16] <MrGremy> i beat the zone and came back to fight him
[1:47:18] <+Inferno_Icon> 2nd enemy technically bitterNah
[1:47:25] <%darcfowler1995> You have to get even harder Pat
[1:47:25] <%xeros720> hmm, wonder if that does ki dmg
[1:47:25] <crimsonsaens> Farming skill points I see
[1:47:26] <%Lion_kun> Pat you know you can run past him right?
[1:47:26] <+zetastriker> I think the devs intend new players to run past him, given a side mission later.
[1:47:32] <joey_jo_jo_juniorshabadoo> RPGs are flawed in that they only give you Experience for successes, when in reality you get just as much experience in life from failures.
[1:47:35] <GUNxSPECTRE> Pat has like 2.5 souls doesn't he
[1:47:38] <+MrFalco> i can't believe people are tuning into a souls like and complaining about time spent on an enemy AND suggesting he run.
[1:47:53] <GuardMeShielder> Got use that low stance to evade more.
[1:47:54] <%derap41> @joey_jo_jo_juniorshabadoo They fuck you think Pats being doing the last 20 minutes
[1:47:56] <%xUmbraNinja> Okay Joey. ]
[1:47:57] <Ipsenscastle> I'd have thought all these burst counters would have crushed its ki or something
[1:47:57] <heartlesshealer> no, it's that you run from the charge attack to lead him into stuff
[1:48:04] <vVAstrAVv> pat he probably wont charge if you stay on his ass
[1:48:11] <BoneBagMel> yooo on the 2nd?=
[1:48:11] <%thecasket> second hit this time
[1:48:18] <BoneBagMel> #MIXUPS
[1:48:23] <%Lion_kun> The game ecplicitly tells you to run
[1:48:28] <Fien111> This doesn't feel right for Souls, though. you don't have to spend 20 minutes nickle and diming the first boss in a souls game unless you're doing something wrong, usually
[1:48:29] <GUNxSPECTRE> Why dodge backwards on the downswings?
[1:48:29] <MrGremy> @MrFalco the game tells you to run when you get here LUL
[1:48:30] <+Mumbles519> pat why aren't you using your ki pulses?
[1:48:33] <$Xevtes> what does the bosses horns changing length signify?
[1:48:37] <+omglmao> bosses stress me out so much god
[1:48:38] <%thecasket> It's weird that he's getting new moves each attempt
[1:48:42] <%GarbageNirvana> idk I'm sure he's doing better than I would, I have zero patience for these games
[1:48:43] <DamnGoodCake> @Lion_kun The spit is strong in this Pat
[1:48:47] <%darcfowler1995> Pat you need to take a break for five minutes fuck
[1:48:48] <%Spaghetto_Godfather> @PatStaresAt when you deplete his purple guage all your attacks will stagger him. don't back off if you have stamina when its depleted
[1:48:49] <LoneO7> @Xevtes i think its his horns being destroyed
[1:48:50] <tusk102> @PatStaresAt ki pulses??? also level up plea s e
[1:48:52] <+stellarseeker> this is the boss you're supposed to run from
[1:48:52] <joey_jo_jo_juniorshabadoo> I mean, any clearer and I would just have to say you should get XP even when you die because that's how life actually works. Guy.
[1:48:54] <+hawk_rush> ninja actively patching as we speak
[1:48:56] <%derap41> @Fien111 Cause this is NIoh Not Dark Souls
[1:48:56] <+netrac> He's leveling up
[1:48:59] <sexdrugsvideogames> standing behind him makes it difficult to predict
[1:48:59] <$lotharrio> It's learning, self evolving. Every time Pat loses, it gets stronger.
[1:48:59] <captainnathaniel> @patstaresat cohhcarnage killed him in one shot btw
[1:49:02] <%derap41> 20
[1:49:04] <+cgmerryo> this seems like fighting a black knight with a broken straight sword
[1:49:08] <%GabeSweetMan> Boss leveling up on Pat's souls.
[1:49:09] <$rooooooooooot> chat he wants to fight and beat the boss. let him
[1:49:10] <%Agami23> @Xevtes basically when you break his horns you get more souls and it causes a big burst of stamina loss in the boss
[1:49:10] <%NeroInfinite> what are thoose blue swords?
[1:49:18] <+l33t_j4gu4r> does patt not have any yokai abilities just tuned in?
[1:49:22] <heartlesshealer> dodged into the swing's hitbox
[1:49:25] <%xUmbraNinja> Didn’t realize this was life. Oh boy Joey.
[1:49:26] <+Mumbles519> @NeroInfinite allies you can summon
[1:49:28] <%GarbageNirvana> I bet AngriestPat would have killed him in one shot too
[1:49:28] <%derap41> @NeroInfinite Dead players or NPCs
[1:49:33] <%NeroInfinite> Ah okay
[1:49:35] <heartlesshealer> Pat only has Fish
[1:49:37] <ZE_Count> Just got here how Pat been dong?
[1:49:40] <Fien111> @derap41 same style, though. If the game tells you to run when you first see him though then Pat's just underleveled. I know Nioh scales way more like that
[1:49:44] <%GabeSweetMan> HUH you can go UNDER?!
[1:49:50] <joey_jo_jo_juniorshabadoo> PatStares sucks, AngriestPat would've finished this by now.
[1:49:57] <%PhantomMiG> @patstaresat Cohn has been playing since Alpha for this game
[1:49:59] <+EySoyCoco> keep parrying him the fuck out
[1:50:00] <%WhereIsWill> now thats a lotta damage!
[1:50:01] <%Kay_Tana> Kay_Tana subscribed with Twitch Prime. They've subscribed for 19 months! 19. The death counter for this vid?
[1:50:02] <$Xevtes> @Agami23 so its a cool guy feature
[1:50:04] <%madogod> wtf pat i was gone for 10 mins and ur still fighthing him
[1:50:05] <%derap41> 21
[1:50:07] <+EySoyCoco> KEEP PARRYING NO STOP
[1:50:12] <%trueherobappo> Im confused...why does he have so much health for a basic enemy..
[1:50:12] <%Mr_Pylon> This is the whole stream huh
[1:50:12] <%xUmbraNinja> Nah just you Joey.
[1:50:13] <%AngriestAngryArtist> you got this
[1:50:14] <sexdrugsvideogames> good idea with the tree
[1:50:16] <$floralkami> okay, you rolled into that one twice
[1:50:19] <ZE_Count> YOU CAN DO IT!
[1:50:19] <+Pookiedaexzile> aaxes
[1:50:20] <heartlesshealer> parry like sekiro?
[1:50:20] <Monkeyweed21> You need to press the offensive when they run out of purple
[1:50:22] <VirtuaRailith> This wouldn't be a problem if you could just do the ol' poke poke poke with a spear
[1:50:22] <$lotharrio> When are we gonna get an AngriestPat and PatStaresAt crossover?
[1:50:23] <+zetastriker> I forget how much ki it takes to block this guy.
[1:50:26] <%Mr_Pylon> Ganbare!
[1:50:26] <coldfire0007> If you grap your souls, you can level up
[1:50:27] <%HunguyTV> dodging in high stance Kreygasm
[1:50:30] <+zetastriker> But blocking is generally good.
[1:50:30] <%trueherobappo> i just got here so idk whats going on...
[1:50:30] <+Jontman42> @PatStaresAt If you get your shark you can run back to level up like 5 times
[1:50:31] <Neo_Kaiser> So how are the journalists doing in this game?
[1:50:31] <%darcfowler1995> It is a little bit funny
[1:50:32] <vVAstrAVv> he can only parry red moves iirc
[1:50:33] <Cerabret100> @trueherobappo he's not a basic enemy, you're supposed to avoid him
[1:50:36] <%valriot> Odachi is great
[1:50:37] <+Lost_Zombie> Can't wait for peach to do it in one
[1:50:40] <%derap41> @Fien111 Only slightly more to be honest Dark Souls Is pretty stat driven too
[1:50:43] <%xeros720> pat stares at some bull oni
[1:50:46] <Oxybe> JUST DO THE THING AND BEAT HIM PAT, GOD!
[1:50:49] <%GabeSweetMan> I mean you could just start over. It'd take less than 5 minutes to get back here.
[1:50:50] <$floralkami> WHAT WAS THAAAAAT?
[1:50:55] <%LustrousEudemon> pat stop playing like a tank and start playing like a dps
[1:50:56] <$Xevtes> @Lost_Zombie dont jinx her
[1:50:56] <JerZeyCJ> You have an ocachi in your inventory, you know
[1:51:02] <$rooooooooooot> just beat him 4Head
[1:51:02] <%derekwst3> @PatStaresAt you can always restart, you are not that far
[1:51:03] <%trueherobappo> @cerabret100 Ah, so pats goblins again huh?
[1:51:05] <Oxybe> ITS OBVIOUS THING WORKS AND WILL KILLZ HIMS
[1:51:05] <heartlesshealer> dodging towards the hitbox
[1:51:10] <%xeros720> elmo saving the stream
[1:51:16] <%NeroInfinite> shoulda learned to dodge and parry better. Kappa
[1:51:23] <Dragon_Batman> I mean some of it is figuring out the timings, the damage doesn't seem to be the big worry
[1:51:24] <+cgmerryo> it's not the weapon, you're mistiming dodges
[1:51:29] <heartlesshealer> Elmo has blessed
[1:51:32] <Cerabret100> @trueherobappo Kinda, you actually come back to this spot to beat him in a side mission
[1:51:38] <Aydarkzero> excuse me?
[1:51:40] <+nogoodusernamesleft156> stances make it a trick weapon?
[1:51:44] <$rooooooooooot> what could you have done for that second charge
[1:51:45] <+hawk_rush> really?
[1:51:45] <LazyLudens> no shit
[1:51:47] <%misha_kastrilevich> ELMO KILL HIM
[1:51:57] <tusk102> pat you do that in dark souls too?
[1:51:58] <%patriotrenegade> cant u just, idk, come back later
[1:52:00] <%optimasmaximas> same in dark souls
[1:52:00] <%SoFarFetched> yeah dont poop
[1:52:02] <%Valentinius_Anodyne> @nogoodusernamesleft156 Yeah, it's one of the new weapon types
[1:52:07] <%trueherobappo> oh cool. @cerabret100
[1:52:09] <+Jontman42> @PatStaresAt If you get your shark you can run back to level up like 6 times
[1:52:09] <taquito_blade> Pat kill it later
[1:52:09] <+zetastriker> Double tap for dodge into roll
[1:52:10] <Ipsenscastle> DODGE RIGHT when he charges, he always lifts his horns to the left
[1:52:10] <%derap41> 22
[1:52:10] <GUNxSPECTRE> Isn't that just Souls
[1:52:10] <Glass_Muffin> It did that in the last game too didnt it
[1:52:12] <%fleshgoat> fleshgoat subscribed with Twitch Prime. They've subscribed for 7 months! heck yeah new month new sub, more kissies for elmo
[1:52:12] <ZE_Count> I think this is a avoid the strong enemy til you level up thing pat.
[1:52:12] <heartlesshealer> learning
[1:52:13] <tusk102> @PatStaresAt you put your weapon away with an estus too?
[1:52:15] <BoneBagMel> squash
[1:52:15] <%patriotrenegade> That happens in Dark Souls too
[1:52:17] <%Verd_254> should dodge in low stance regardless
[1:52:18] <%Rngiddion> motherfucks you dont put your weapon away in dark souls
[1:52:20] <Dragon_Batman> Test it out of the fight
[1:52:20] <chaos2frozen> @PatStaresAt I don't get it, what's the confusion?
[1:52:22] <%thecasket> If you go get your grave you can leave and level up at the shrine
[1:52:22] <$floralkami> shake the bag for energy
[1:52:22] <pixelkenj> yeah zero ki means hits always stagger
[1:52:22] <Firemahci> hit him in the back for 150% damage
[1:52:25] <tusk102> ??
[1:52:27] <%PaladinDupre> @PatStaresAt you might be able to acquire an Odachi off some of the dead guys you can summon and fight. Look for one with an odachi in its weapon slot.
[1:52:27] <stevo_scar> We doin it?
[1:52:28] <sexdrugsvideogames> its extra hard mode
[1:52:30] <+zetastriker> Block to take it back out instantly
[1:52:31] <%NeroInfinite> Yes it does?
[1:52:31] <%AngriestAngryArtist> Nah you right
[1:52:32] <FrankysDream> @PatStaresAt hey pat will you play more black mesa at some point?
[1:52:32] <%dmtjinni> GET GUD LUL
[1:52:32] <Cerabret100> uh...what?
[1:52:33] <+Link232> Drinking estus disarms you for a moment, it doesn't switch you to unarmed stance
[1:52:37] <%optimasmaximas> wtf are you taklking about?
[1:52:38] <Glass_Muffin> He is right it doesnt put it away
[1:52:38] <+shinlake> if aris can beat em pat can beat em lol
[1:52:40] <Sol_Install> Pat...
[1:52:40] <Jarvanii> you cant even put your weapon away in souls lol
[1:52:40] <heartlesshealer> actually in this game you're popping pellets
[1:52:40] <Bust_ER> It’s not dark souls
[1:52:41] <worldbrand> there is no putting your weapon away in DS
[1:52:43] <%valriot> You want the baby dodge, the High Stance dodge has less iframes
[1:52:45] <taquito_blade> Pat just kill it later, come back after youve beaten the levle
[1:52:46] <%thecasket> It puts your weapon away in an animation but it doesn't really mean anything gameplay wise, in souls that is
[1:52:47] <%darcfowler1995> Yeah while you’re drinking you can’t have your sword and the cup in your hand at the same time motherfucker
[1:52:47] <Monkeyweed21> Pat be aggresive when he's out of ki
[1:52:50] <%AngriestAngryArtist> nah eh's right it just chugs and then you auto ready
[1:52:53] <%GabeSweetMan> You don't PUT IT AWAY chat, it just swaps into your hand for the animation.
[1:52:53] <$rooooooooooot> Pepega chat
[1:52:54] <%derap41> You can't even Put your weapon away in dark souls
[1:52:55] <JerZeyCJ> Please Pat, I'm begging you, just use the "cheat" stuff
[1:52:55] <LazyLudens> oh, by putting away do you mean sheath?
[1:52:57] <+kralec> @PatStaresAt to be fair, it's impossible to put your weapon away at all in dark souls.
[1:52:57] <%dmtjinni> LUL NICE TRY
[1:52:59] <Dragon_Batman> Pat means de-equip weapon when he is saying put it away
[1:52:59] <stevo_scar> What two weapons are we working with?
[1:53:00] <valriot> You can just double tap dodge for long rolls
[1:53:00] <%superc37> DEAR GOD HE HAS SO MANY SOULS
[1:53:09] <tusk102> @PatStaresAt OH YOU MEANT UNARMED STANCE i thought you meant "why is my weapon not in my hand"
[1:53:13] <%LustrousEudemon> I think your character might have a concussion by now
[1:53:16] <%ahdurian> bs that shouldve hit
[1:53:19] <heartlesshealer> use your fish
[1:53:19] <JackalKing> Its got Monster Hunter healing instead of Dark Souls healing. Gotta put that weapon away
[1:53:20] <%optimasmaximas> @GabeSweetMan yeah thats we were reffering to in the first place
[1:53:26] <GUNxSPECTRE> At least this is good practice, if he levels up
[1:53:26] <%spiritofmojave> you can't drink sunny d and swing your weapon at once LUL
[1:53:31] <+Inferno_Icon> You can double dodge to get a roll in mid/low stance more i frames
[1:53:41] <%GabeSweetMan> Wow yeah at IS a lot of experience points.
[1:53:44] <tusk102> @spiritofmojave he meant that his stance gets changed to unarmed when he heals
[1:53:45] <heartlesshealer> yeah that's new
[1:53:45] <BoneBagMel> yoooooooooooo
[1:53:45] <$rooooooooooot> that was new
[1:53:45] <+hawk_rush> NEW MOVE
[1:53:46] <%Typhaeon> Whoa what the hell
[1:53:47] <%ahdurian> NEW MOVE
[1:53:48] <+kuervojones> Man, everyone is using the glaive. Is it that good?
[1:53:48] <%thecasket> another new move
[1:53:50] <BoneBagMel> H OW MANY MOVES?!
[1:53:52] <%patriotrenegade> u ever fight an nigh-impossible to beat enemy just to flex
[1:53:52] <+kralec> I mean, that attack comes out the same. I guess there is a difference in roll though.
[1:53:53] <nuane> NEW MOVE AN HOUR IN
[1:53:55] <$floralkami> WHAT ARE THESE TELLS?
[1:53:57] <%GabeSweetMan> New moves being patched in as we speak.
[1:53:57] <%Typhaeon> It really is a reverse training dummy
[1:53:58] <Neo_Kaiser> Pat, do combo
[1:53:58] <%Roasted_Pheasant> Is Nioh the true samurai souls?
[1:54:00] <%darcfowler1995> No only the Sunny D kid from the commercials can do that because he is a legend only he is allowed to use his weapon and drink at the same time￼
[1:54:00] <xIgnitionCrowx> there goes the machete slam
[1:54:02] <GUNxSPECTRE> Why is Pat doing this at like LVL 2?
[1:54:03] <%afronooch> glaive is new so it makes sense
[1:54:07] <$rooooooooooot> the first boss should have like 4-5 attacks max dude
[1:54:08] <%xeros720> its learning
[1:54:08] <%spiritofmojave> @tusk102 ah, yeah that makes more sense
[1:54:10] <%thecasket> Gozuki is in the fight lab atm with Pat
[1:54:16] <%NeroInfinite> So many new moves except they aren't new.
[1:54:16] <nuane> they updated the boss while pat's plying
[1:54:16] <$rooooooooooot> hes a fucking swiss army knife of moves
[1:54:17] <%patriotrenegade> mushed
[1:54:18] <stevo_scar> Is @PatStaresAt aware of the counter mechanic?
[1:54:18] <%derap41> 22
[1:54:19] <%Zerodyne90> LUL
[1:54:20] <Ipsenscastle> good effort
[1:54:21] <heartlesshealer> long hitbox pat
[1:54:23] <LazyLudens> oh, by putting away do you mean sheath??
[1:54:24] <Reise04> How long we been at this?
[1:54:25] <Djinnazz> yeah
[1:54:25] <captainnathaniel> @patstaresat you still have not seen this guy full moveset btw
[1:54:26] <+zetastriker> He should just continue on. He doesn't know the mechanics well enough to succeed yet.
[1:54:27] <coldfire0007> Level up?
[1:54:27] <%valriot> @roasted_pheasant It already was before Sekiro came out LUL
[1:54:28] <DamnGoodCake> Pat, take a 2 minute break
[1:54:28] <joey_jo_jo_juniorshabadoo> You are so unver-leveled for this fight lmao
[1:54:30] <LORDSPOOKLEKINS> @rooooooooooot he's not technically a boss
[1:54:31] <Firemahci> try guarding, you take no damage
[1:54:32] <%misha_kastrilevich> Elmo is a good luck charm
[1:54:32] <+cgmerryo> level up please

[1:54:39] <%darcfowler1995> Men just bite in the pillow on this one aren’t you
[1:54:40] <+bluedude153> Wait they updated this boss?

[1:54:54] <YujinYo> Give the controller to elmo
[1:54:54] <%GabeSweetMan> Grab those souls and level up
[1:54:57] <%xeros720> gozuki is gaing skillpoints just like pat is
[1:54:58] <Zebroneath> Did healing sheath in the first game?
[1:54:58] <ZE_Count> level up more pat
[1:55:01] <nuane> what was that
[1:55:04] <+netrac> He'll be max level by the end of this
[1:55:05] <%thecasket> This is gonna be like what Minh does in the end, every skill unlocked in the starting area
[1:55:06] <%madogod> he die 22 times?
[1:55:07] <fattyboy067> looks like a guard break to me
[1:55:09] <sexdrugsvideogames> guys, thats how you git gud

[1:55:20] <ZE_Count> should of been doing that instead
[1:55:22] <coldfire0007> Minh strats
[1:55:22] <Ipsenscastle> try guarding instead of dodging seeing as the tracking is so unpredictable
[1:55:25] <stevo_scar> It's a tough dude but the demon parry makes this fight very possible. Just like fighting Havel
[1:55:26] <%xUmbraNinja> @derap41 indeed man. I got tired of it fast lol.

[1:58:40] <Ipsenscastle> You need to stay in more to stop that bullshit charge coming out
[1:58:40] <moguuera> pat please for the love of god you can skip this boss
[1:58:40] <Zebroneath> This enemy is optional, right?
[1:58:40] <$rooooooooooot> the charge does that much?
[1:58:41] <stevo_scar> You got his number now
[1:58:41] <heartlesshealer> Hug elmo for luck
[1:58:43] <%GabeSweetMan> Well he tried a different way to avoid it. Can't dodge into the charge: Lesson learned.
[1:58:45] <DamnGoodCake> Pat, Take Break, Read Dono's, Get Big and Strong
[1:58:45] <%thecasket> @Zebroneath yes
[1:58:45] <Oxybe> THERE IS NO COW LEVEL
[1:58:47] <%derap41> Imagine how boring it would be if this was easy
[1:58:47] <+shaidot> maybe take the next one really slow and safe
[1:58:48] <%JD_Lars> Ouch. Bad place and timing
[1:58:49] <%AngriestAngryArtist> yeah the charge move is the one that gets most people LOL!
[1:58:50] <$floralkami> FUCK ALL THE BITCHES SAYING "DODGE THROUGH IT
[1:58:51] <vVAstrAVv> he stamps da feet before charging btw
[1:58:51] <sexdrugsvideogames> this fight is so tense

[1:58:59] <LoneO7> just play better
[1:59:00] <+CelticFrost70> when you get him into a depleted bar, remember to use triangle to do a backstab
[1:59:02] <%derap41> Check if you have any good magic to learn
[1:59:02] <heartlesshealer> oh, for each stance
[1:59:07] <SubjectTea> wait, did he beat ther boss?
[1:59:12] <%misha_kastrilevich> @PatStaresAt What kind of soup is Paige making?
[1:59:12] <%tacotaculartaco> tacotaculartaco subscribed with Twitch Prime. 
[1:59:12] <%NeroInfinite> Magic is for neerds
[1:59:13] <%afronooch> Seconded, Pat Take Break, stretch legs, read donos
[1:59:16] <%spiritofmojave> Bet this is also like Path where it's super easy to recognize late into a leveling path you fucked up
[1:59:19] <vVAstrAVv> no and not a boss
[1:59:23] <%NeroInfinite> Getting punked by TRASH
[1:59:24] <%neVan0> oh no
[1:59:26] <tusk102> please take a break
[1:59:27] <%superc37> @jorniev it's very good, he's just not playing smart
[1:59:29] <%derap41> @NeroInfinite so why did Pat spec in it
[1:59:31] <wolfman_jack21> Ki Pulseman sounds like a goddamn Hideo Kojima character
[1:59:34] <GUNxSPECTRE> Pat doing a challenge run with Early game armor
[1:59:34] <nuane> grapple only works if the targeting thing is red
[1:59:34] <Djinnazz> yeah
[1:59:34] <%Laecerelius> yeah
[1:59:35] <DatAsuna> Yes
[1:59:35] <fattyboy067> ye
[1:59:36] <Skeletonmanners> yea theres a respec
[1:59:36] <heartlesshealer> maybe
[1:59:37] <%MrBorisMakarov> ye
[1:59:37] <%thecasket> It's an item
[1:59:37] <tusk102> yes

[1:59:39] <+nekodelic> there is
[1:59:40] <+Dudealy> You're gonna bust so hard when you finally do beat him
[1:59:42] <Skeletonmanners> there was in 1 its still in this
[1:59:43] <taquito_blade> not that i know atm
[1:59:44] <%GabeSweetMan> First game had it so yeah I'd hope so.
[1:59:45] <%spiritofmojave> That's good
[1:59:45] <%Valentinius_Anodyne> I would imagine, the first game has plentiful respecs
[1:59:47] <Djinnazz> it's the book
[1:59:47] <joey_jo_jo_juniorshabadoo> Spec isn't the issue. Your tunnel vision is
[1:59:49] <%GarbageQueenEllie> Respecc should be MANDATORY
[1:59:49] <DamnGoodCake> yuuup
[1:59:49] <%NeroInfinite> Because pat is an erd
[1:59:50] <+PlainClothesHero> ooh theres like transforming weapons now?
[1:59:51] <LazyLudens> ye lol
[1:59:52] <%superc37> @patstaresat there is, but you unlock it later
[1:59:53] <tusk102> yes sadly
[1:59:53] <Fujiwara_92> yup
[1:59:55] <pixelkenj> its pretty easy to get though
[1:59:55] <%xUmbraNinja> Yes
[1:59:58] <+zetastriker> 3 points REALLY doesn't matter though
[1:59:59] <heartlesshealer> but tunnel vision
[2:00:00] <vVAstrAVv> again ARE YOU SURE YOU PLAYED NIOH 1
[2:00:00] <DatAsuna> However it is infinite
[2:00:01] <Monkeyweed21> Starting stats dont really matter
[2:00:02] <+PE4X> thoes stats don´t matter though
[2:00:04] <LazyLudens> i haet it too
[2:00:05] <%superc37> No, you can change all your stats
[2:00:06] <stormhawk9891> It's only like 3 points tho
[2:00:06] <EuropanLamprey> Just like Dark Souls
[2:00:06] <+kralec> @PatStaresAt probably can't changes the 3 points from start, but all the rest yeah
[2:00:13] <heartlesshealer> bye fish
[2:00:15] <%Axellogic> Yeah but those starting starts are 1 point out of 200
[2:00:19] <%derap41> @NeroInfinite Don't know what an Erd is. Some kind of fish?
[2:00:24] <Jarvanii> getting all stats to 10 or something is fine though
[2:00:25] <%NeroInfinite> Yes
[2:00:25] <%patriotrenegade> gg
[2:00:28] <LoneO7> nice job
[2:00:29] <%thecasket> Oh no your hubris
[2:00:30] <Tucker0603> WHY?
[2:00:31] <KazMkII> Wut
[2:00:31] <Fujiwara_92> monkaS
[2:00:31] <GUNxSPECTRE> This game is like all about gear tho
[2:00:31] <%MalekDracarus> GEED
[2:00:35] <Ipsenscastle> what was your plan, sir?
[2:00:38] <heartlesshealer> yeah
[2:00:39] <%GeneralSCPatton> JUST MAX EVERYTHING, LIKE A GOD WOULD
[2:00:39] <$floralkami> @wolfman_jack21 dude, all you have to do is add -man to any word and you can do that...
[2:00:42] <EuropanLamprey> @Axellogic What is Min-Maxxing for 400?
[2:00:42] <ECRead> Yokai enemies stagger on almost every hit if they are out of Ki
[2:00:44] <%thecasket> That one didn't count
[2:00:45] <+ValHollaYoloson> WHY WOULD YOU DO THAT
[2:00:47] <Ambiguous_Anti> Is that thing a boss or miniboss?
[2:00:48] <Dragon_Batman> I don't think changing up stats and the like will help, it seems like he is too early to fight
[2:00:49] <%NeroInfinite> It's the same as the urethra fish
[2:00:52] <LazyLudens> @Jarvanii is it recommended? or is it just something that is okay to do but not ideal?
[2:00:52] <%GabeSweetMan> Take a break for a few minutes and talk to chat
[2:00:54] <+hawk_rush> apatGib
[2:00:55] <GUNxSPECTRE> Fight the phantoms and get gear
[2:00:56] <LoneO7> castle super greed
[2:00:59] <%thecasket> When he does the charge he stomps his right foot
[2:00:59] <Fujiwara_92> makes sense Kappa
[2:01:04] <vVAstrAVv> pat this is torture
[2:01:15] <LoneO7> this is a delight
[2:01:21] <$lotharrio> Alright having never played this game, I can say that your spirit animal appears to be the dreaded candiru. So get up in that urethra and expand, Pat.
[2:01:23] <+Dudealy> Just reach max level by killing that first demon over and over @PatStaresAt
[2:01:29] <moguuera> OPTIONAL BOSS THO
[2:01:30] <%GabeSweetMan> I'm learning shit, I haven't touched this yet.
[2:01:35] <Jarvanii> @LazyLudens depends if you want to be able to use everything you find. you hit softcaps really fast so it's not a bad idea.
[2:01:45] <%thecasket> He did it as his first attack this time, what
[2:01:46] <heartlesshealer> but optional boss means optional rewards!
[2:01:47] <stormhawk9891> @lotharrio ummmmm....
[2:01:47] <crimsonsaens> At this point, Pat should change the stream title to Pat Stares at Gozuki
[2:01:56] <%GarbageQueenEllie> What's Elmo's spirit animal?
[2:01:56] <%derap41> @lotharrio Is that the Asian Pee fish?
[2:01:56] <Dragon_Batman> LUL
[2:02:00] <yficaptions> I thought Pat was good at Souls games
[2:02:02] <%thecasket> Gozuki the king
[2:02:02] <%patriotrenegade> Pat Stares At A Wall
[2:02:04] <+Pookiedaexzile> yezzer.....Optional....You can Optionally be a bitch
[2:02:05] <moguuera> the attack tracking seems sorta wild in this
[2:02:08] <EatTheB0otyLikeGroceries> I'm watching the re6 vod, much more exciting than this crap
[2:02:10] <+zetastriker> He really needs to learn he can combo yokai with broken ki.,
[2:02:15] <%madogod> @PatStaresAt when his bars are red it means you can continue to attack him and he will stagger
[2:02:23] <$floralkami> @lotharrio do all fish make you think of penis fish now?
[2:02:26] <%GabeSweetMan> That overhead is doing a LOT of work whacking him in his weakspot.
[2:02:26] <YujinYo> I thought he was good at souls too
[2:02:29] <moguuera> you can optionally retain your sanity and move on
[2:02:29] <vVAstrAVv> pat is playing gozuki lol
[2:02:33] <%Valentinius_Anodyne> Pat Stares At the Gates of Hell
[2:02:34] <%superc37> @lazyludens there is also the fact that most armor require at least 5-10 of any 2 given stats so ye
[2:02:41] <%GabeSweetMan> NICE dodge
[2:02:42] <Josef_Stryker> Is Pat STILL fighting this guy?
