[0:09:43] <sirtommygunn> god hes cute
[0:09:48] <%MidnightPacif1c> psaDogchamp
[0:09:49] <%BinaryFireball> did you defeat all your mindgoblins with it?
[0:09:52] <%JoshManVGH> Hows the controller support?
[0:09:53] <Calek> how are you handling the kingdom management?
[0:09:59] <%RealThiele> goblin damaged?
[0:10:06] <+victhebeard> what kind of game even is it.
[0:10:14] <%BinaryFireball> crpg
[0:10:16] <+TardyClock> It's a CRPG
[0:10:17] <%cartakus> Difficult therefore  bad?
[0:10:19] <gslayer14> monolith? rad, it needs more attention
[0:10:19] <%boxboten> crpg
[0:10:26] <+TardyClock> Think Baldur's Gate or Neverwinter Nights.
[0:10:33] <SomeStrangeBroad> i got smart and took my shit before the stream
[0:10:34] <+Buttlo> Kingmaker had issues
[0:10:59] <%G_Thunders> D:
[0:10:59] <Treasure_Vault> quickly... very quickly.
[0:11:00] <%DovaDude29> DovaDude29 subscribed with Prime. They've subscribed for 5 months, currently on a 1 month streak! Didn’t notified that my twitch sub expired, oops.

[0:11:10] <tpc28> tpc28 subscribed at Tier 1. 
[0:11:16] <%DianaTheAscian> is this real?
[0:11:16] <+Buttlo> It wasn't a bad game but it certainly had issues. I would imagine playing it turn based would be a significantly better experience seeing as how much more I enjoyed the sequel in turn based.
[0:11:20] <+Mrbaconator> one dee one two
[0:11:20] <%AyotoCorp> @PatStaresAt Kingmaker on launch had literal doubled stats for enemies as a bug
[0:11:22] <%RealThiele> my Roes
[0:11:25] <$SGrim> hurk
[0:11:25] <%JoshManVGH> What?
[0:11:26] <%MidnightBurst12> no fun allowed
[0:11:30] <+Mrbaconator> that reads like a scrub quote
[0:11:38] <%KeiganOfAstora> CRPG means Card RPG?
[0:11:40] <+ps4nubian> bro are you still doing Earthbound soon?
[0:11:57] <matsu_me> hello gief
[0:12:00] <draca23> Only really became a problem for me at the end. I wouldn't call the game 'unfair' just challenging. divinity 2 had more bullshit, imo.
[0:12:02] <Calek> @KeiganOfAstora classic
[0:12:04] <%AgniBrandt> @KeiganOfAstora Classic or Computer RPG, I believe
[0:12:06] <%RealThiele> pathfinder can go hard with math
[0:12:07] <%maskofmichael> Pause for dog
[0:12:09] <%BinaryFireball> nah think its like classic
[0:12:17] <%BinaryFireball> western rpg essentially like dnd
[0:12:18] <%JoshManVGH> @keiganofastora Computer RPG. Like a Baulders Gate or a Pillars of Eternity
[0:12:18] <%SpontaneousC> Kingmaker was also super aggressive with Swarm Enemies in early game
[0:12:23] <%cartakus> fun game
[0:12:27] <+Mrbaconator> @RealThiele and i fucking LOVE IT
[0:12:36] <azure_dunes> what game we talkin about??
[0:12:37] <%Blank9> "oh I have 40% more hp from one level up"
[0:12:40] <%G_Thunders> 4 > 3 I don’t see the problem
[0:12:40] <+Buttlo> Oh God the swarm enemies
[0:12:48] <+victhebeard> is it like Divinity but pathfinder?
[0:12:49] <%AgniBrandt> There IS a late game area in Kingmaker that is just bullshit
[0:12:53] <@Ranryu692> that seems like something that should have been obvious
[0:12:54] <%XelanArdel> are you playing it real time or turn based? i dont remember if the turn based was a later patch or a mod
[0:12:55] <sirtommygunn> D&D having a 20 level range doesn't translate well to 50 hour rpg computer games
[0:12:55] <%boxboten> i got filtered by the swarm and quit
[0:12:56] <%Pappajimbo> change of plan run away
[0:12:56] <%RealThiele> 5 is real shit. FIREBALL BAYBEE
[0:12:57] <%Mr_Pylon> People forget that BG1 had the valley of Fuck You it's Basilisks
[0:12:58] <%notsoy> yep, once you get certain important abilities and get past the threshold of getting one-shot by things, it's ezpz
[0:13:00] <%AgniBrandt> The mansion can go to hell. If you know, you know
[0:13:04] <%maskofmichael> Beating Mind Goblins off screen?
[0:13:08] <%W1nterTitan> Good name
[0:13:18] <draca23> THe swarm enemies in the beginning are a non-issue. The game SHOWERS YOU with explosions.
[0:13:21] <%Wrashis> Wrashis subscribed with Prime. They've subscribed for 51 months! Hello Pat, I havent been watching many of your vods cuz I'm low key waiting for you to start a full playthrough of something. Excited for Elden RIng though. Legit question though, do you think you will go back to NMH3 ever or has the time passed?
[0:13:22] <%W1nterTitan> That's actually a sick name.
[0:13:26] <+starlorb3> hey pat, not sure if it was already asked, but how are the savage raids going for you?
[0:13:38] <Manwad> but my gamer cred
[0:13:42] <+Mrbaconator> yes you can
[0:13:42] <+zaitje> My pride tho
[0:13:46] <Tracazoid> But my pride, Pat!
[0:13:46] <%doc_ock_rokc> ITS NOT ABOUT LOGIC PAT
[0:13:47] <%RealThiele> my father will disown me if i set it to easy
[0:13:48] <%notsoy> to those people, turning the difficulty down is like admitting defeat
[0:13:49] <%Futurecity10> No because I'm not a pussy
[0:13:50] <sirtommygunn> what if they're already on the easiest one
[0:13:51] <%Agami23> no but then your a pussy if you do that
[0:13:54] <%AyotoCorp> Not everyone read that article from bean dad 2.0
[0:13:55] <+Buttlo> I didn't like the time management aspect of it.
[0:13:56] <scempriss> But thats like saying im bad at videogames, AND IM NOT
[0:14:00] <%MelBrooksKA> but my penis tho
[0:14:00] <%Futurecity10> Thats a joke I should mention
[0:14:03] <+Catpurnicus> there's a subset of D&D players that think like Miyazaki, and make games for masochists
[0:14:04] <+victhebeard> bit what if its already on the lowest setting Pat
[0:14:05] <moonmintparadise> Well there is a difference between being fair and just being bullshit
[0:14:11] <%W1nterTitan> So a forgiving DM
[0:14:15] <%Agami23> hearing that the game has more difficulty modes than i thought makes me more interested
[0:14:17] <%DianaTheAscian> b-but m-m-my p-pride...
[0:14:27] <bob900000> real gamers don't play on easy /s
[0:14:33] <%StephanieSadGirl> maxmor2Teefs Hello Orb! maxmor2Teefs
[0:14:34] <%Mr_Pylon> More difficulty options is a selling point
[0:14:41] <%Futurecity10> @PatStaresAt You havent gotten to the part where enemies break the leveling cap. There are enemies with a combinded level of 130
[0:14:42] <%notsoy> they also give you tons of knobs to turn, like enemy HP/damage/healing options, etc
[0:14:47] <HotMafia81> (The whole ruleset was designed for freak-ass min-maxers)
[0:14:47] <azure_dunes> Potion of GET BIG
[0:14:51] <Manwad> but then my fellows in the king's court will believe i am effeminate and soft of skin if i play on anything but Omega Hellmode
[0:14:55] <definitelynotjayy> potion of ponder orb
[0:14:57] <%Mr_Pylon> Listen, someday I might need that Lvl 1 Grease scroll
[0:14:58] <+tempestzephyr> enlarge that dick
[0:14:59] <%G_Thunders> Does it count as delusions for review guy to decide the devs are being malicious on purpose?
[0:15:00] <%DianaTheAscian> @patstaresat hey Pat do you have any plans to stream that Bloodborne PS1 thing when it comes out?
[0:15:02] <+starlorb3> gotta save those incase there is a super secret super final boss
[0:15:02] <%RealThiele> potion of enlarge person Kreygasm
[0:15:04] <%shruke> Those games give you SO MANY potions and scrolls
[0:15:05] <%notsoy> pathfinder in general is for freak min-maxers
[0:15:05] <%Amadeusguy> see pat, the game forced them to play on the hardest difficulty because they can't just play on easy, and the hardest was too hard
[0:15:13] <sirtommygunn> my strength wizard build isn't working this is BULLSHIT

[0:15:29] <%Bluwizard21> zero ranger is goddamn impossible at the end of the game
[0:15:32] <%JoshManVGH> And if it's shit
[0:15:38] <definitelynotjayy> hi chat hi pat im snowed in af :)
[0:15:49] <Manwad> zero ranger fuckin' goes hard
[0:15:52] <+Mrbaconator> i shit on stag lord when i got to him KEKW
[0:15:55] <%Pappajimbo> fort
[0:16:11] <%RealThiele> owlbear adventures!
[0:16:13] <%AyotoCorp> Stag Lord's a punk-ass bitch

[0:16:16] <scempriss> Staglords whole backstory is that he's a bitch
[0:16:16] <+Mrbaconator> ye you kind of just no sell him
[0:16:16] <%Buzzard42> good old stag lord
[0:16:18] <moonmintparadise> Owlbears are the best in any game
[0:16:22] <draca23> Yeah lol, that happens.
[0:16:24] <+upandadam> the optional shit is the high challenge stuff
[0:16:27] <%RealThiele> yeah PF is rocket tag agreed
[0:16:30] <+TardyClock> Also crits are ABSURDLY lethal
[0:16:33] <+Mrbaconator> @TardyClock correct. it fucking RULES
[0:16:34] <draca23> Stag Lord is a joke, and you can make him even weaker with side quests.
[0:16:36] <%BinaryFireball> spoilers: it was just actually a random deer
[0:16:38] <%notsoy> everybody kills hard and dies fast in this and in wrath
[0:16:40] <draca23> Did you poison his drink, too?
[0:16:44] <%epide> now when can we fight a bear owl
[0:16:44] <%Pappajimbo> shit he party wiped me twice
[0:16:44] <%Buzzard42> Staglord always goes down like a bitch, even in P&P
[0:16:57] <%StephanieSadGirl> My problem with all of the games like PAthfinder kingmaker and baldurs gate is that when playing actual TTRPGs there are FARFARFAR from as many combat encounters as there are in the video games
[0:16:58] <scempriss> you have to get a good role in the woods outpost
[0:17:00] <+TardyClock> If you go to the Thorn River Camp first you can recruit Kressle.
[0:17:04] <definitelynotjayy> sword saint is a sick ass class name
[0:17:06] <scempriss> with the crazy lady with the axes
[0:17:09] <draca23> You find his alcohol near some bandits and you spike it lol
[0:17:12] <+Mrbaconator> two handed fighter amiri with her starting barb levels as a dip FUCKS
[0:17:16] <%shruke> i love when you crit with like, an arrow, and the deer explodes
[0:17:19] <%Pappajimbo> you find his stash there its hidden
[0:17:28] <scempriss> you can fail the roll to find it
[0:17:37] <%Pappajimbo> fuck him
[0:17:40] <%RealThiele> poison all the bandits and you get a bonus
[0:17:40] <draca23> You're supposed too
[0:17:44] <%BinaryFireball> that gnome is all I remember from that game and I hated him so
[0:17:48] <%SpontaneousC> Path of the Righteous I feel is a lot more solid, it drops the timer at least, but it does have a weird not super great Heroes of might and magic style sub-game
[0:17:53] <+Havictos> ok just got here what is this?
[0:17:56] <%dalmek> path of finder
[0:18:00] <+TardyClock> They just EXPLODE.

[0:21:59] <%kyh9> Will we ever see a Psychonauts stream?
[0:21:59] <%Blank9> does lost judgement do that with bullying is bad
[0:22:05] <%starlorb3> It's his style pat
[0:22:08] <%blastyoboots> "subtlety is for cowards" isn't always the way to go
[0:22:09] <+wmeldrum> how is that different from aunty Donna beating a dead horse with a joke

[0:22:19] <%maskofmichael> Like a running joke that's not funny
[0:22:19] <%AgniBrandt> @PatStaresAt It's his BRAND

[0:23:22] <+HolePunchLeaf> I think Kojima has never legitimately missed ever
[0:23:24] <+sewermonk> is death stranding anti mind goblins
[0:23:26] <artoflec> i think death stranding is one of the worst games ive played in like a decade, but its fun to look at
[0:23:26] <%Agami23> i hope you at least look into the ending of no more heroes 3. its ending has something that i feel like would make you lose your mind
[0:23:27] <%kyh9> Death Stranding did feel very similar to MGSV to me, but that may just be me
[0:23:33] <marvel877> Death Stranding's nuts and I love it. I am not in a rush to replay it, but I do want to replay it again one day.

[0:32:16] <@Moobot> Hey folks, just a reminder! If you have Twitch connected to Discord, you can access the PSA Sub-Discord. Go to your User Settings, go to Connections, and click 'Join' on the PSA server under the Twitch connection.
[0:32:38] <%StephanieSadGirl> Oh side note, for anyone that isn't subscribed, getting access to the discord is one thing, but the discord letting you use the elmo and gief emotes EVERYWHERE on discord is like, worth the price of the sub 10fold

[0:57:15] <GreenHerbWhiteSmoke> is this a roguelike?
[0:57:15] <%sonuke_draws> you went back
[0:57:18] <Saltmeisterr> no
[0:57:20] <%dalmek> I think you went out instead of in
[0:57:22] <%greasypete00> SourPls
[0:57:23] <+Mendin> Down = Tutorial, Up = Level
[0:57:26] <gslayer14> no you went the wrong way
[0:57:29] <Manwad> @GreenHerbWhiteSmoke yes
[0:57:31] <tanarath> Going down is the tutorial, up is new.
[0:57:42] <GreenHerbWhiteSmoke> @Manwad thx
[0:57:42] <%blastyoboots> I misread the instructions:  When you're on the MAP SCREEN, pressing the BOMB button salvages your current weapon and returns you to basic weapon.  BOMBING WEAPONS DOES NOT SALVAGE THEM I WAS VERY WRONG
[0:57:53] <+Lord0Mugen> lemme guess, shooter roguelike?
[0:58:05] <heartlesshealer> that makes more sense, blastyoboots
[0:58:10] <heartlesshealer> thanks for explaining

[0:59:51] <%blastyoboots> I misread the instructions:  When you're on the MAP SCREEN, pressing the BOMB button salvages your current weapon and returns you to basic weapon.  BOMBING WEAPONS DOES NOT SALVAGE THEM I WAS VERY WRONG sry- last time i'll paste
[0:59:51] <Saltmeisterr> @PatStaresAt btw, overhealing contributes to max hp

[1:14:40] <+Lord0Mugen> KEYS~
[1:14:54] <Silent_Fyraena> Does the steam hurt you?
[1:15:03] <DensityD> just dodge the raindrops
[1:15:25] <%SpontaneousC> This kind of feels like if Descent was a roguelike and not a motion sickness simulator
[1:15:26] <%blastyoboots> ammo gives you salvage when you're on basic weapon
[1:15:37] <+Catpurnicus> thats just the hyper light drifter logo
[1:15:38] <GreenHerbWhiteSmoke> this is like gungeon and binding of issac had a baby
[1:15:39] <rufus2k2> FREE WARFRAME MONEY?!
[1:15:42] <gslayer14> shiny bock
[1:15:43] <Jerp> I really gotta dip back into this. they like tripled the size of the game with the last big update

[1:16:19] <Saltmeisterr> thats a fuckin curse
[1:16:21] <+Lord0Mugen> @GreenHerbWhiteSmoke Gunegon sucked. I agree that the RNG and the amount of useless "trap" weapons was bullshit.
[1:16:34] <+CapnClassix> SourPls
[1:16:51] <+Lord0Mugen> *Gungeon
[1:16:54] <Coreagrus> Gotta say, I love how this game handles items. They salvage into other things so as to not be useless, and they disappear if you leave the room, to eliminate tedious minmaxing.
[1:17:00] <gslayer14> pat pick up those weapons next time
[1:17:00] <Coreagrus> At least, that's how I see it.
[1:17:10] <gslayer14> they provide healing and money
[1:17:17] <+Lord0Mugen> The game looks quality
[1:17:26] <gslayer14> middle
[1:17:28] <+Lord0Mugen> the middle one!
[1:17:29] <%Bailey__Gaming> seems good
[1:17:29] <+Mendin> He didnt want to overwrite his cursed weapon
[1:17:30] <gslayer14> it's good
[1:17:31] <+Lord0Mugen> hell yeah!
[1:17:34] <Waypastfuture> yooo

[1:23:10] <%Calek> at least they're not Isaac tears
[1:23:10] <gslayer14> train for the no weapon achievement
[1:23:25] <Coreagrus> I think it's worth noting that the whole game is balanced around and tested with base damage and the starting weapon.
[1:23:28] <AtelierZeno> cumsprite
[1:23:31] <Coreagrus> Which I think is really sick.
[1:23:32] <%blastyoboots> holy crap he took a health

[1:24:15] <+Fetrigon> almost got squashed LUL
[1:24:16] <Jerp> I tended to use reserves so often in regular runs
[1:24:24] <Jerp> it's an extra 10% w/the base weapon

[1:28:06] <Coreagrus> This game is just such a good shmup. I wouldn't say that for nearly any other roguelike.

[1:31:24] <%blastyoboots> you're immune to status effect and non-boss icicles probably
[1:31:24] <GreenHerbWhiteSmoke> @PatStaresAt it was lightning i thought
[1:31:26] <%MidnightBurst12> environmental ice
[1:31:27] <tanarath> IMMUNITY TO ELEMENTAL STAUS
[1:31:30] <Hydrapissed> dang that boss slammed yo ass
[1:31:33] <AtelierZeno> you're immune to chill status not ice damage
[1:31:36] <gslayer14> rember dash
[1:31:36] <%Jerp> I remember it used to be possible to kill this boss so quickly you'd break the boss and have to start a new run
[1:31:41] <%blastyoboots> Lightning Frost and-- hazards, that was it
[1:31:47] <+pectusumbra> I figured it'd be like stage harzard stuff like water
[1:31:48] <%Buzzard42> is this monolith
[1:31:51] <gslayer14> lot of patterns assume you will dash to avoid them

[1:33:58] <gslayer14> multiplier loss is big
[1:33:58] <Hydrapissed> could even be a box
[1:33:59] <%Buzzard42> it could even be 40 ammo
[1:34:01] <+Mendin> Map is showing the location of a Secret Room it looks like?
[1:34:02] <@Ranryu692> it could even be a boat

[1:34:51] <%MrBorisMakarov> man this game looks RAD
[1:34:54] <AtelierZeno> oh was this your first run?
[1:34:55] <Coreagrus> This game's pretty good about contact damage. They knew which things shouldn't have it.
[1:35:00] <Coreagrus> Like enemies that teleport.
[1:35:00] <+Havictos> what is a construct?
[1:35:01] <akitanito> Melee?!
[1:35:02] <%doc_ock_rokc> YES these are KEYWORDS
[1:35:02] <%Calek> they're unlocks for future runs
[1:35:06] <OtterSlinger> It was like, his 3rd run
[1:35:07] <Saltmeisterr> unlocks
[1:35:07] <Toottootpants> It puts them into the item pool
[1:35:11] <%doc_ock_rokc> They add these Keywords to your weaponpool
[1:35:12] <reonome> they unlock stuff
[1:35:13] <gslayer14> they show up in runs
[1:35:13] <AtelierZeno> they add stuff to the random pool
[1:35:14] <OtterSlinger> Maybe 2nd
[1:35:14] <+pectusumbra> I'd guess unlockable mods/keywords
[1:35:22] <%Jerp> unlocks for future runs plus you can toggle 'em on and off if you don't like 'em
[1:35:25] <gslayer14> ice bombs
[1:35:30] <Hydrapissed> reflects the past and the future

[1:35:55] <%ChrisPlaysThing> Man, the word "Keywords" is such poison to me now, i've escaped, but the damage remains
[1:36:16] <TurtlesAndTentacles> @pectusumbra oh myyyy
[1:36:26] <gslayer14> hope you get to see floor 5
[1:36:32] <rudiciuscaesar> Woah, digging this Mega Man-ish soundtrack.
[1:36:51] <gslayer14> bomb here maybe?
[1:36:57] <%MrBorisMakarov> I do appreciate that there's basically default weapon builds
[1:36:58] <GreenHerbWhiteSmoke> so the devs of this game did all the testing and balancing centered around playing with no upgrades?
[1:37:03] <%blastyoboots> missed chest room

[1:37:46] <%Blank9> reminds me of enter the gungeon
[1:37:48] <Coreagrus> Based on all of my time with it, you don't need damage ups at all.

[1:38:16] <%Jerp> AtelierZeno I played the hell out of this a while back, even accidentally got a couple of WRs, and then later on kinda got overwhelmed with the amount of new content they added
[1:38:17] <%act8lyrist> wait until you guys see zero ranger. they are BOTH gems

[1:57:02] <+inkandamber> This isn't the regular game mode dude.
[1:57:04] <Coreagrus> White Vanilla is fundamentally different.
[1:57:04] <%luftraumm1> the sort of game I wish was another genre
[1:57:11] <TurtlesAndTentacles> why not black vanilla
[1:57:14] <+inkandamber> This is the time attack mode.
[1:57:15] <Coreagrus> Which is sick. It's no easy mode.
[1:57:21] <TurtlesAndTentacles> you got green orange
[1:57:25] <heartlesshealer> express?
[1:57:27] <tattleworm> i like b more
[1:57:30] <KingSpunf> White Vanilla is pretty cool though
[1:57:32] <quietshun> White vanilla has new stuff, do it after you beat the game
[1:57:32] <+inkandamber> NOOOOOOOOOOOOOO
[1:57:33] <%GIGA255> white vanilla, montreal augmentation INSTALL. Activate: French Vanilla!
[1:57:35] <+CapnClassix> I didn't know Pat was into SHMUPs
[1:57:36] <+inkandamber> NO NONO
[1:57:37] <akitanito> beeg beams
[1:57:39] <+inkandamber> TYPE A
[1:57:51] <%Blank9> type a isn't unlocked
[1:57:51] <+inkandamber> Trust me you want Type A dude!
[1:57:53] <lol_red_ranger> Shmup Fraud Pat
[1:57:57] <+inkandamber> SOMEONE TELL HIM WITHOUT SPOILING SHIT.
[1:57:57] <mikkos522> Ya can't use A
[1:57:59] <KingSpunf> This track is very Apparitions Stalk the night
[1:58:02] <heartlesshealer> just let him play
[1:58:06] <+Lord0Mugen> Not enough contrast for my liking.
[1:58:07] <%crimsonharvest> is _any_ of that shit revenge bullets or am i just paranoid
[1:58:10] <%RetroCop87> @inkandamber on suicide watch
[1:58:12] <%Jerp> heartlesshealer it does some interesting stuff like killing waves causes the game to fast forward through some stuff, and overall it blasts through the game quicker, but also has its own extra stuff
[1:58:13] <RyeBreadBakery> this type looks like my speed
[1:58:22] <TurtlesAndTentacles> I just thought about it...vanilla isn't white...it's black...smfh
[1:58:25] <+Catpurnicus> damn look at the backgrounds
[1:58:25] <+inkandamber> @RetroCop87 HALP ME!
[1:58:25] <Manwad> @crimsonharvest revenge bullets sometimes
[1:58:30] <+Catpurnicus> all the buildings retracting lol
[1:58:31] <TurtlesAndTentacles> the name makes sense
[1:58:35] <%crimsonharvest> oh FUCK ITS VIC VIPER
[1:58:40] <+inkandamber> I honestly forget the unlocking of stuff in this game.
[1:58:43] <%GIGA255> the bean is black. vanilla flower is white
[1:58:44] <GreenHerbWhiteSmoke> did he beat green orange yet?
[1:58:45] <+inkandamber> It's been a while since I've been here.
[1:58:46] <%linSP> is the music midi or is it just me
[1:58:48] <heartlesshealer> @Jerp Glad to hear it has extra stuff, only ever played the normal game
[1:58:49] <%dalmek> @Lord0Mugen there is an option to switch to Blue Orange mode, if that's more your speed (and the only concern)
[1:58:50] <+Catpurnicus> lol Arc Adder
[1:58:54] <KingSpunf> Bic Biper
[1:58:58] <%Valdorick> Its likes some kind of... A- DAMN IT
[1:59:06] <%crimsonharvest> whats happening why did we murder gradius
[1:59:08] <+inkandamber> Pat. Don't do a Woolie and miss all of the cool ass references dude.
[1:59:13] <GreenHerbWhiteSmoke> its some kind of giant goose
[1:59:14] <%The_Protagonist> Dic Diper
[1:59:21] <akitanito> good
[1:59:25] <%dalmek> you must achieve zen
[1:59:25] <Manwad> bullet hell eyes
[1:59:27] <%Jerp> heartlesshealer hopefully you got _that_ far, cause even the main mode has a lot of stuff
[1:59:30] <+Catpurnicus> I just stare at my ship
[1:59:34] <Treasure_Vault> you can't look at one thing, you must see all things
[1:59:38] <KingSpunf> R
[1:59:40] <+Lord0Mugen> @inkStrikers 1945?
[1:59:42] <%king_wragles> Wanted Y, chose R
[1:59:46] <@Ranryu692> that's kind of how I walk around tbh
[1:59:47] <+inkandamber> Anyone here played and of the Crimson Clover releases?
[1:59:49] <TurtlesAndTentacles> Mic Madder
[1:59:58] <heartlesshealer> @Jerp I got _that_ far, I just never tried the vanilla fragrance mode
[1:59:59] <Kokobang> hey Pat, how come you never had to use glasses?
[1:59:59] <%GIGA255> oh neat. that beam is in soldier blade
[2:00:04] <KingSpunf> Crimson Clover rules
[2:00:05] <+inkandamber> Peter Parker
[2:00:13] <jumpyhugs> not focusing helps me catch fish in hades too
[2:00:17] <%strakillias> Is the boss of this level gonna be donkey kong?
[2:00:20] <+inkandamber> @KingSpunf Have you tried the newest release?
[2:00:29] <+Catpurnicus> crawl on the ground, like the snake you are, Arc Adderrrrrr
[2:00:29] <%GIGA255> who needs glasses when you have cups?
[2:00:33] <@Ranryu692> @jumpyhugs I close my eyes and go off the sound lol
[2:00:36] <+inkandamber> MEMBER Ikaruga stage 2?
[2:00:41] <%Bailey__Gaming> this stage is very xenon 2
[2:00:41] <%crimsonharvest> this artist played a lot of metal storm huh
[2:00:47] <GreenHerbWhiteSmoke> black clover is a bad story
[2:00:57] <KingSpunf> @inkandamber nope, not yet.
[2:01:00] <+Lord0Mugen> yeah im not feeling this as much as Monolith
[2:01:31] <akitanito> welp
[2:01:34] <%Blank9> does sin and punishment count as a shmup still
[2:01:35] <%Bailey__Gaming> soundtrack 10/10
[2:01:41] <%BallerSwagBro9k> git gud
[2:01:53] <+Catpurnicus> lo-fi-ruga
[2:01:56] <KingSpunf> This stage is like stage 2 of Ikaruga
[2:01:59] <akitanito> Do you get infinite credits for continues?
[2:02:05] <Waypastfuture> I am so happy this and monolith are getting attention
[2:02:06] <%GIGA255> i miss star successor
[2:02:11] <+inkandamber> @KingSpunf Aww, yeah it's good dude. The new game mode is basically "what if we out do cave black label levels of bullet spam" in what is essentially an OP score rush mode that eclipses all of the other ones.
[2:02:15] <+Lord0Mugen> ill see yall when he does huntdown
[2:02:16] <akitanito> r-type!
[2:02:17] <mikkos522> You build up your credits
[2:02:17] <+rbakervv> it's r-type
[2:02:17] <GreenHerbWhiteSmoke> lol he had to use a continue plupPound
[2:02:17] <%Jerp> akitanito there's a level select you can use
[2:02:17] <Coreagrus> @Blank9 That's that sick rail shooter, right? I'd say so.
[2:02:18] <+inkandamber> MEMBER R=TYPE?
[2:02:22] <theredfox930000> big P playing the good shit
[2:02:26] <+Lord0Mugen> RETYPE!
[2:02:26] <+SergeEXE> R TYPE
[2:02:29] <+Catpurnicus> did he just steal his option
[2:02:29] <@Moobot> Hey folks, just a reminder! If you have Twitch connected to Discord, you can access the PSA Sub-Discord. Go to your User Settings, go to Connections, and click 'Join' on the PSA server under the Twitch connection.
[2:02:31] <%cartakus> EVIL
[2:02:32] <%Buzzard42> get fucked
[2:02:33] <+Lord0Mugen> *RTYPE
[2:02:34] <GreenHerbWhiteSmoke> Nt
[2:02:44] <heartlesshealer> Options are dirty, says Pat
[2:02:47] <%JonathLP> 9... 7?
[2:02:48] <%The_Protagonist> Gama Ovar
[2:02:52] <%JonathLP> Isn't there an 8 in there?
[2:02:55] <Treasure_Vault> This game is pretty tough.
[2:02:56] <TurtlesAndTentacles> this is hard
[2:03:00] <GreenHerbWhiteSmoke> pat just cursed an entire timeline to death and suffering Sadge
[2:03:06] <SaltyAzteca> I wonder if they have a Tyrian boss LUL
[2:03:08] <+inkandamber> @rbakervv I KNOW, I've drank wine OK. Fingers are all over the keyboard right now.
[2:03:09] <mikkos522> Try unlocking the back shot
[2:03:17] <retconrecon> start from 2
[2:03:20] <%delilah4you> Oh nice you can start on the second stage at least
[2:03:22] <Waypastfuture> yep
[2:03:24] <TurtlesAndTentacles> so you get more continues the more you play
[2:03:27] <Vyneci> I thought Pat was a shmup god from what I've heard Kappa
[2:03:34] <+justianxix> you can start later stages as uou go
[2:03:37] <+inkandamber> If people haven't played this to the end, I promise you, it's totally worth the grind.
[2:03:38] <TurtlesAndTentacles> THATS AWESOME
[2:03:49] <Treasure_Vault> Shmup God Pat and Pat are not the same person. I was confused too.
[2:03:50] <mikkos522> Getting through this game isn't hard it's super fair and rewarding
[2:03:50] <+SergeEXE> I love this game so much
[2:03:55] <+inkandamber> @Vyneci Pat's alt is Shmup God Pat
[2:03:56] <+Mendin> Who here's played Crimzon Clover?
[2:04:01] <mikkos522> You get no penalties for starting at a later stage
[2:04:06] <Treasure_Vault> Unless it's a Dr. Jekyll Mr. Hyde scenario.
[2:04:08] <+SergeEXE> @Mendin YOOOOOOOOOOO
[2:04:17] <%Axellogic> this touhou ass music
[2:04:20] <%GIGA255> there should be a hard mode where debris from killed enemies causes damage
[2:04:21] <+inkandamber> @Mendin Me! It's awesome!
[2:04:25] <KingSpunf> @Mendin here
[2:04:29] <+Mendin> That is some aesthetic-ass shmuppage
[2:04:49] <+DynamicDonut> ...that's JUST VIC VIPER
[2:04:54] <quietshun> @axellogic oh there's a song that's way more Touhou than this
[2:04:54] <+inkandamber> @Axellogic It's those pianos. I think this was made in norhtern europe.
[2:04:59] <+Mendin> Arc Adder, you mean
[2:05:01] <topiodonk> my only experience with shmups is one of the touhous, this looks cool
[2:05:15] <+inkandamber> BE ENERGY FOR GAINS
[2:05:25] <Manwad> disc room!
[2:05:27] <Coreagrus> Crimzon Clover isn't one of my favorites, but I love it for essentially getting me really into shmups.
[2:05:36] <%dalmek> you're handing control over to your monkey brain
[2:05:37] <KingSpunf> I got my highest score on Mushihimesama while stoned lol
[2:05:49] <Coreagrus> Taking in the whole screen is generally useful.
[2:05:51] <%Jerp> Pat: there's sort of a way you use your peripheral vision to kind of check movement against a general idea of where you were
[2:05:51] <mikkos522> It's a Finnish game by shmup enthusiasts
[2:05:56] <tanarath> Focusing on an object limits your awareness, unfocusing evens it
[2:05:58] <+inkandamber> @Coreagrus It's super accessible
[2:06:02] <LorcaNomad> I totally understand but can't explain why it works with the looking thing
[2:06:02] <Coreagrus> Tunnel vision is a killer in shmups.
[2:06:07] <+inkandamber> Also, didn't chat say this ship was unlocked
[2:06:13] <+inkandamber> It has a charged shot pat.
[2:06:21] <GreenHerbWhiteSmoke> is this x-type?
[2:06:21] <+inkandamber> Someone tell him when he gets to it.
[2:06:23] <%GIGA255> tap into your hunter instincts by utilizing your peripheral vision
[2:06:28] <+inkandamber> That's why this ship is so OP.
[2:06:30] <%Jerp> it's sort of like, you de-focus and then see the big picture and it's easier to see paths through bullet waves
[2:06:32] <+Mendin> the only touhou I know is, I think, Subterranean Animism? The one whose final boss is a nuclear crow whose big attacks are basically rolling giant suns at you
[2:06:48] <+justianxix> game starts with both ships, its the power ups that unlock
[2:06:52] <EdgarLOLZ> Ay this games the shit
[2:07:00] <Coreagrus> @Mendin Man, I need to play that one at some point.
[2:07:03] <+inkandamber> The Imperishable Night series is the one that seemed to penetrate the West.
[2:07:14] <%dalmek> @Mendin that's the nameyeah. My gut says that's uh 11?
[2:07:24] <+inkandamber> @justianxix I thought so. I remember about the power ups. I'm just forgetting. I apologise.
[2:07:29] <mikkos522> SA is 11 yeah
[2:07:34] <%linSP> Fart gas shot
[2:07:59] <akitanito> ass bullets
[2:08:01] <gslayer14> skull a bad pat
[2:08:02] <+NecDW4> @PatStaresAt Are you sure YOU arent the oft mentioned "SHMUP God Pat" from teh podcast?
[2:08:06] <%waltzqueen> the only touhou i played was scarlet weather rhapsody
[2:08:08] <+inkandamber> I absolutely adore this OST
[2:08:13] <akitanito> you can't shoot the option
[2:08:14] <+wizard_of_diamonds> Loving the music
[2:08:18] <+Mendin> OR-Type lmao
[2:08:18] <+inkandamber> Did anyone ever play Axelay for the SNES?
[2:08:29] <+inkandamber> Konami's forgotten Shmup.
[2:08:35] <mikkos522> You can do it Pat!
[2:08:36] <+Catpurnicus> thats a fucking R-Type
[2:08:37] <KingSpunf> Or-Type is a fucking roadblock
[2:08:38] <+justianxix> yeah this guy is alot more tricky
[2:08:49] <Elsewize> DO IIIIT!
[2:08:55] <tattleworm> r-type tactics, surprisingly good and lost to time
[2:08:55] <+inkandamber> I was on about AXLAY dude.
[2:08:57] <%Buzzard42> ARTYPO
[2:08:58] <topiodonk> imperishable night ost fucking slaps
[2:08:59] <%pokefan9956> what company made twinbee again?
[2:09:00] <+NecDW4> @PatStaresAt You check out the R-Type Final 2 yet?
[2:09:00] <GreenHerbWhiteSmoke> ROFL
[2:09:02] <LorcaNomad> PogChamp he did it
[2:09:04] <%pokefan9956> I always liked twinbee
[2:09:06] <%Jerp> R-Type Final 2 has been pretty solid
[2:09:06] <Explodincatz> bringing the Hell into bullet hell
[2:09:08] <GarbageNirvana> So idk if you know about R-Type's orb but typically you don't want to shoot the orb
[2:09:09] <wqorst> ??
[2:09:10] <%greasypete00> lol
[2:09:11] <+bluedude153> lmao
[2:09:12] <+justianxix> LUL
[2:09:12] <heartlesshealer> artypo
[2:09:15] <jumpyhugs> oh boy
[2:09:15] <+inkandamber> Axelay is the fucking shit.
[2:09:20] <+Catpurnicus> where's the Darius fish level
[2:09:20] <%Jerp> plus they keep adding content to it. lots of stuff now
[2:09:20] <LorcaNomad> angy pat
[2:09:23] <%waltzqueen> hey, did pat already discuss his Crazy Talk creating Castlevania NFTs after his Bloodstained Stream?
[2:09:24] <gslayer14> ded
[2:09:28] <tattleworm> least we can start from 2 now
[2:09:32] <%linSP> Which one was the snes shmup with the old banjo guy
[2:09:32] <tattleworm> with both weapons
[2:09:33] <matsu_me> ya winna son?
[2:09:41] <+inkandamber> A
[2:09:46] <heartlesshealer> I don't wanna hear about Konami digging into the give up box
[2:09:49] <%GIGA255> press on, weary nova wanderer
[2:10:00] <+justianxix> he talked about the Castlvania NFTs? oh boy LUL
[2:10:01] <+NecDW4> Im so bad at Final 2... fkin age and shit. I loved the hell out of Final 1 in the day
[2:10:05] <+inkandamber> It's so good that they give you continues after every run rather than every hour like the OG version of Ikaruga did
[2:10:14] <%waltzqueen> @heartlesshealer us @ Nfts: die monster! you dont belong in this world
[2:10:15] <%Agami23> the music in this is baller af
[2:10:18] <+Catpurnicus> Introducing NFT, or Not For Trend, for True Doom Murderheads only
[2:10:25] <+inkandamber> @heartlesshealer LOL
[2:10:29] <+Orcapugs> Shmup GOD Pat
[2:10:31] <+Trademarkidiot> Whats the next mind goblin gmae?
[2:10:43] <mikkos522> This game is so dope man
[2:11:08] <%Supermonaman> Supermonaman subscribed at Tier 1. They've subscribed for 29 months, currently on a 29 month streak! Arrived late to the stream. Woolie introduced this to me during his birthday stream and I loved it. Cool to see you playing it.
[2:11:18] <+inkandamber> Konami sealed themselves into the give up box the minute they stopped caring about games.
[2:11:37] <+wizard_of_diamonds> I can barely watch these games without my eyes going nuts lmao
[2:11:40] <topiodonk> im looking at bullet hell games on steam and i get why nier replicant is there, but its still funny
[2:11:41] <%GIGA255> wanna buy dome
[2:11:51] <%GIGA255> buy some castlevania nfts?*
[2:11:57] <heartlesshealer> @inkandamber fair enough
[2:11:59] <mikkos522> I mean most of this game isn't really bullet hell
[2:12:08] <akitanito> use your fart shots
[2:12:20] <mikkos522> The devs excplicitly didn't want to make a 2hulike game since there's so many of those nowadays
[2:12:25] <heartlesshealer> backburner was chosen with the other ship
[2:12:25] <+SergeEXE> LUL
[2:12:44] <+inkandamber> @mikkos522 That's why it's so cool. It's the weirdest middle ground. Bullet placement is really smart, but also really fast.
[2:12:45] <%hairtoday> whenever you mention konami, you take a hit
[2:12:47] <GarbageNirvana> R-Type is Irem
[2:12:51] <akitanito> can you go behind him and shoot?
[2:12:51] <%Jerp> double kill there
[2:12:54] <+SergeEXE> YOU GOT DIS
[2:12:55] <+justianxix> basically a dark souls boss
[2:12:58] <%Mr_Pylon> thanks please continue Tali
[2:12:59] <Manwad> R Typo is mean
[2:12:59] <Coreagrus> It's neat that this boss gives you a reason to stop shooting.
[2:13:00] <+Catpurnicus> I look forward to the sequel, Zone of the Rangers
[2:13:01] <heartlesshealer> double ko
[2:13:08] <GreenHerbWhiteSmoke> you got added to his ship mokyNOPERS
[2:13:14] <+SergeEXE> To be fair, this is a rough sub boss
[2:13:19] <%Jerp> R-Type is now Granzella (former Irem and named after a faction in R-Type Tactics 2)
[2:13:22] <+inkandamber> @GarbageNirvana I was talking more about the sound font originally. Sounds like an SNES game. Konami's Axelay especially.
[2:13:24] <gespenstkick> Prease
[2:13:26] <heartlesshealer> orb crackles with your power, I love it
[2:13:35] <GarbageNirvana> ah, well
[2:13:36] <GreenHerbWhiteSmoke> @SergeEXE it shouldnt be for the shmup god
[2:13:42] <Treasure_Vault> This is a tough game. I think I gave up and watched someone good play it way further than I could.
[2:13:47] <%pokefan9956> how long are we from pat playing touhou?
[2:13:55] <LorcaNomad> he do it
[2:14:00] <+inkandamber> bunnnClap bunnnClap bunnnClap
[2:14:04] <akitanito> SIDEWAYS
[2:14:15] <akitanito> literally not r-type
[2:14:29] <holyrory> music in this game is incredible
[2:14:40] <+inkandamber> Anyone here ever play Thunderforce 4?
[2:14:44] <+SergeEXE> @holyrory Yes, especially later on
[2:14:46] <SuperMintSoda> the ultimate in cutting edge scientific technology. Flying sideways
[2:14:49] <%pokefan9956> why don't they just turn their ship lol
[2:15:01] <wqorst> 1st try
[2:15:03] <%Jerp> SuperMintSoda and in G-Darius you even turn around!
[2:15:14] <+inkandamber> LES GOOOOOOOOOOO
[2:15:16] <GreenHerbWhiteSmoke> do the time freeze glitcg
[2:15:23] <+NecDW4> That boss intro WARNING keeps making me think of Warning Forever
[2:15:30] <tattleworm> super close
[2:15:33] <%doomunderthestairs> rageja2RIP rageja2RIP
[2:15:40] <@Lion_kun> PAT IS COWARD
[2:15:45] <+wizard_of_diamonds> That voice ALMOST sounds like Tali
[2:15:45] <rasamune> Dang
[2:15:45] <tanarath> Rough but fair
[2:15:46] <+SergeEXE> This is very much a You Must Practice game
[2:15:46] <mikkos522> The homing shots in that phase are rough
[2:15:47] <+justianxix> almost got him
[2:15:56] <+inkandamber> I loved the way old games did that. They forced you to mash through the "no continue" countdown.
[2:16:01] <LorcaNomad> try A-type?
[2:16:02] <+inkandamber> It's super fair dude. It's just GOOD.
[2:16:08] <+wizard_of_diamonds> Does that voice sound straight up like Tali to anyone else?
[2:16:09] <quietshun> Stage 2 is the one I still have trouble with
[2:16:14] <Hydrapissed> LOL
[2:16:15] <+Orcapugs> Gg

[2:16:32] <tanarath> God, that intro

[2:30:54] <nappingonstream> they called out anna conda earlier
[2:30:55] <MaybeFalco> oh sick thats a neat detail
[2:30:58] <%VentWilsn> ITS MO MAN
[2:31:00] <+joesum_> that's pretty awesome
[2:31:02] <GreenHerbWhiteSmoke> nasty
[2:31:02] <jumpyhugs> Mow Man! This'll be a treat!
[2:31:04] <nappingonstream> funnily enough they sounded a LOT more afraid of anna conda
[2:31:09] <artoflec> the sound design is fucking stellar in this game
[2:31:09] <nappingonstream> they said "Oh fuck she's a killer"
[2:31:11] <%cartakus> Mah man
[2:31:11] <+inkandamber> The sound is really good for a 2D game even now. Listening to this with a surround system, and despite a down mix, it sounds great.
[2:31:14] <jumpyhugs> Here I am! While ya eat!
[2:31:14] <%Bailey__Gaming> STASH
[2:31:15] <TurtlesAndTentacles> they called out Anna too.
[2:31:16] <+InvisiblessedReptile> @TurtlesAndTentacles woolieYE
[2:31:17] <%Blank9> bounty hunter robocop is a terrifying concept
[2:31:21] <GreenHerbWhiteSmoke> MOW EM DOWN Kreygasm
[2:31:23] <bullprophet> still pretty cool they added the extra voiceline for playing a differenthunter
[2:31:24] <LorcaNomad> god the amount of animation work is fucking NUTS
[2:31:26] <nappingonstream> I think the first stash was near the beginning where you jumped down becasue the floor just
[2:31:30] <nappingonstream> gave me a breakable vibe
[2:31:52] <+Mrbaconator> RATS
[2:31:55] <%cartakus> Mow man needs a chainsaw arm
[2:31:59] <+inkandamber> The music totally has that FM quality to it, but without sounding farty like the genesis did.
[2:32:03] <sennoh> I have 40 hours in this game so far, it is crazy addictive for a pick up and play style of gaming
[2:32:05] <+joesum_> this is the best sounding 2d scroller I ever heard
[2:32:06] <nappingonstream> was theere ground shake when playing as anna conda??
[2:32:09] <nappingonstream> is that new
[2:32:39] <+inkandamber> Is this game going to end up with you murdering a shit load of cops?
[2:32:39] <@Moobot> Hey folks, just a reminder! If you have Twitch connected to Discord, you can access the PSA Sub-Discord. Go to your User Settings, go to Connections, and click 'Join' on the PSA server under the Twitch connection.
[2:32:55] <getter_robo_nova> yoooooo it's Birdy from SF
[2:33:03] <%Bailey__Gaming> Shoot him Pat, he's British
[2:33:13] <+InvisiblessedReptile> I bet there's an achievement or something for killing a boss melee
[2:33:15] <%cartakus> psaCrazyhead
[2:33:36] <nappingonstream> this is really cool its just a little bit of a shame that its just another cyberpunk game where you shoot the punks
[2:33:43] <+Fooguwu> right in the dick
[2:33:47] <nappingonstream> though its not this game's fault and its still cool
[2:33:48] <LorcaNomad> MOW MAN
[2:33:54] <+Fooguwu> making robocop proud
[2:33:55] <artoflec> 4 seconds faster than last time rbeePOG
[2:34:00] <nappingonstream> mow man is the coolest one
[2:34:00] <%VentWilsn> oh thats good, enemies dont do damage if they just run into you
[2:34:06] <+xeromage> 2/3 stashes? Activate Goblins!
[2:34:07] <nappingonstream> robocop gone freelancer
[2:34:25] <%cartakus> These people are assholes
[2:34:28] <%Bailey__Gaming> I love this game already
[2:34:37] <+InvisiblessedReptile> Damn, the suspension on the car, they didn't need to kill it this hard, there's so much detail
[2:34:41] <+upandadam> BOP
[2:34:48] <%dalmek> what a weird detail to put in
[2:34:49] <Reanimator83> Give Sawyer a shot
[2:34:58] <gespenstkick> ooo music
[2:34:59] <%VentWilsn> wonder how many more enemies they throw at you in co-op
[2:35:05] <akitanito> lol
[2:35:14] <GreenHerbWhiteSmoke> jumped into it ROFL
[2:35:16] <Silent_Fyraena> Jump up to catch the bullet
[2:35:17] <%cartakus> Is this the closest thing to hotline miami now?
[2:35:21] <%StephanieSadGirl> Wasted
[2:35:26] <+InvisiblessedReptile> game got hands
[2:35:37] <%VentWilsn> LUL he kicks u out
[2:35:45] <KingSpunf> No wonder this game is British, it has that "Uglyon Purpose" thing all UK comics go for
[2:35:46] <+Fooguwu> this game is neat
[2:35:50] <nappingonstream> this is nothing like hotline miami
[2:36:20] <shadoke> the side cover thing reminds me of Blackthorne.
[2:36:25] <%Bailey__Gaming> @kingspunf it's very 2000AD comics isn't it
[2:36:40] <+joesum_> but similar aesthetic
[2:36:41] <Reanimator83> They getaway if you don't kill them quickly
[2:36:44] <%Blank9> there's a lot of blackthorne and elevator action returns
[2:36:44] <%StephanieSadGirl> This is VERY Shadowrun
[2:37:23] <%cartakus> nice mow man
[2:37:24] <nappingonstream> shoot the door?
[2:37:25] <%VentWilsn> DROIDS ARE A WASTE OF AMMO

[3:07:38] <akitanito> you missed that stash
[3:07:48] <%0dokuro> secrets
[3:07:55] <+Errickfoxy> The bagman ran away
[3:07:57] <+Catpurnicus> did that airbike have a stash
[3:07:59] <%cooldude69xx> @Charuzu "We're ready to kick some ice"
[3:08:00] <akitanito> yeah
[3:08:00] <tanarath> The guy who flew away
[3:08:01] <GreenHerbWhiteSmoke> that was stach 2 Sadge
[3:08:13] <%RonaldMcDownload> announcer sounds familiar
[3:08:14] <Treasure_Vault> That was his getaway car, not the stash man
[3:08:14] <%ForlornCarton> Noe, the guy with the stash ran to the hover car and escaped on it
[3:08:15] <%cooldude69xx> @Charuzu "It's PUCK to meet you"
[3:08:20] <%cooldude69xx> These are hard
[3:08:40] <+Errickfoxy> Mullets are mandatory

[3:09:34] <+joesum_> "Ice him boys"
[3:09:44] <%0dokuro> I dont play hockey but I'm pretty sure thats not in the rules.
[3:09:47] <%Blank9> calmly take the escalator into death battle
[3:10:02] <$Robnoceros> something about this boss fight reminds me of Sunset Riders
[3:10:06] <+blastazoid00> Is this huntdown?
[3:10:10] <%TimetodiveLTX> this guy owns
[3:10:16] <marvel877> I feel like Zubaz would fit in bery well in this game.
[3:10:21] <KingSpunf> I don't know much about Hockey, is this accurate?
[3:10:24] <krin_x> this game is fuckin rad
[3:10:29] <marvel877> *very
[3:10:37] <+joesum_> Just a normal game in Canada yes
[3:10:45] <+javolta> what is this?
[3:10:47] <+Catpurnicus> they should have just called them the Goons
[3:10:48] <SuperMintSoda> I've been to canada, can confirm
[3:10:52] <%RyTYoung> don't know how I never saw this game at all last year
[3:10:56] <+Lord0Mugen> @Joesum_ not enough "Sorrys"
[3:10:58] <GreenHerbWhiteSmoke> you can shoot the rpg Pog
[3:10:59] <%maskofmichael> @marvel877 He fits well in every game, but I see your point
[3:11:00] <darkelfdebauchery> @KingSpunf pat should get a 5 min penalty for running the goalie
[3:11:01] <%cartakus> What about the bare knucle fist fights?
[3:11:15] <%Blank9> does the dive kick do  good damage?
[3:11:15] <+Errickfoxy> You know, this kind of makes me want to fire up Mercenary Kings again
[3:11:17] <+RevolverBussalot> sick bos
[3:11:19] <+RevolverBussalot> boss
[3:11:20] <+Catpurnicus> stop goaltending pat
[3:11:24] <marvel877> This is like the Super Shredder equivalent of Casey Jones.
[3:11:26] <Phrickshun> I remember seeing a hockey fight similar to this on TV
[3:11:31] <jorniev> whats this game?
[3:11:34] <GreenHerbWhiteSmoke> what sport is she?
[3:11:38] <%RonaldMcDownload> Imago Drago
[3:11:45] <GreenHerbWhiteSmoke> more hockey? Sadge
[3:11:47] <Uselesswhitenoise> I wish real life gangs did wacky themed costumes
[3:11:48] <marvel877> Two minutes for highsticking
[3:11:49] <artoflec> this game is Huntdown
[3:12:08] <%OrangeMDT> @phrickshun there’s a gun tho…
[3:12:45] <Phrickshun> @OrangeMDT shit, you got me, I'm american
[3:12:56] <$Robnoceros> so this is actually just a legit 16-bit era style shooter? No stupid card gimmicks or anything to ruin it?
[3:13:04] <+Lord0Mugen> This makes me want to put on the chiptune version of Depech Mode's "Enjoy the Silence".
[3:13:16] <%OrangeMDT> LUL
[3:13:18] <%StephanieSadGirl> @Lord0Mugen heck yeah
[3:13:20] <%Maids4lyfe> @Robnoceros looks like it
[3:13:23] <+Catpurnicus> this a saturn game at least
[3:13:27] <Treasure_Vault> @Robnoceros You're right, this game does need card gimmicks.
[3:13:28] <+Catpurnicus> no 16 bit console could run this
[3:13:42] <marvel877> We getting a train level?
[3:13:51] <marvel877> When's the elevator level?
[3:13:57] <%TimetodiveLTX> i wish the trains were this frequent
[3:14:04] <SuperMintSoda> rule of 3 Pat
[3:14:06] <$Robnoceros> 16-bit era style. Obviously this couldn't actually run on any of those consoles
[3:14:17] <+Catpurnicus> is this what happens when leafs fans head to montreal?
[3:14:30] <ergulor> rule of 5 then
[3:14:32] <Uselesswhitenoise> rule of six
[3:14:33] <%0dokuro> Rule of 4
[3:14:33] <%Maids4lyfe> MORE TRAINS
[3:14:34] <ergulor> nevermind
[3:14:34] <Manwad> four is death?
[3:14:35] <artoflec> in Britain its rule of 4 Kappa
[3:14:35] <SuperMintSoda> correction, rule of 3+1
[3:14:39] <+Mrbaconator> 4 is just another version of 3 :)
[3:14:56] <krin_x> is it the movie phone guy
[3:14:57] <GreenHerbWhiteSmoke> shoot the wall 21 more times
[3:14:59] <%Blank9> this is at lowest sega saturn port of an arcade game
[3:15:12] <%StephanieSadGirl> So whats going on here, is Pat just killing average New Jersey Devils fans?
[3:15:19] <+joesum_> So more like 32-bit
[3:15:19] <GreenHerbWhiteSmoke> carbine Pog
[3:15:24] <+Errickfoxy> oh it's an AUG

[3:16:04] <%StephanieSadGirl> YO Wheres the Ref?!  This is high sticking!
[3:16:19] <+Catpurnicus> I wonder what happens if she knocks you in the goal
