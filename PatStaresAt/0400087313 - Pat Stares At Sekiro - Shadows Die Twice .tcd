[0:05:16] <Futurecity10> I find the game too boring. I fell actually fell asleep
[0:05:16] <boswell_doddler> I actually got a refund. I wasn't having any fun with it.
[0:05:16] <+KrippSubBot> The revive mechanic is super generous
[0:05:19] <+Bigshimz> It's Tenchu but complicated?
[0:05:20] <DatAsuna> Also i wish the axe was less lame
[0:05:21] <$HentaiSenpai9K> Pat become the GingerKage you were always meant to become
[0:05:21] <%brickwall35> I mean yeah it looks hard but I didn't know if Pat was Game Grumin' it. thanks chat!
[0:05:25] <%Varnarok> I have hit 1 major block so far and I'm like, 2/3 through the game I would wager
[0:05:29] <%Rakenshin> Aw yeah, made it on time
[0:05:30] <+PenmanLupine> maybe drink more water instead of soda
[0:05:32] <%ScottishMadJacko> so that was a lie with the 10 hour stream

[0:05:32] <roflwaffleauthoritah> lmao just loaded up and the first thing I hear is a dejected 'games really hard'
[0:05:33] <+highfivepotater> @djjazzyj555888 you have to when you play
[0:05:34] <+earthboy2k> >not sure why
[0:05:34] <DatAsuna> It's a lot less tenchu than I'd hoped
[0:05:39] <djjazzyj555888> Aw feel better pat
[0:05:41] <CatmanIX> >10 hour VOD
[0:05:41] <%Nobrev> let the pain drive you and do a 12 hour stream

[0:05:57] <+Zereaux> no he means curse rot
[0:05:58] <TheHaHaNinja> Sekiro really makes you feel like you’re playing dark souls
[0:05:58] <kiryuva> boop! hi, chat!
[0:06:04] <%galaxyswirl> yea, cause you have to use other peoples pips for it @AngriestPat
[0:06:10] <%Varnarok> Curserotted Greatwood infects Japan
[0:06:10] <stabbityrabbit> Ohh, so revive every time you can.
[0:06:13] <%rumtumtugnutz> HONK
[0:06:16] <Solidus_113> resurrecting builds the invisible meter, dying proper cashes it out and makes everyone have aids
[0:06:17] <nukle0nik> @fairore only because this game looks kinda cool but also unggh parrying

[0:06:27] <%orangerainbow> @angriestpat get ready for lighting man to jam it in your pee hole
[0:06:34] <fairore> lol
[0:06:37] <Futurecity10> I just cant like this game
[0:06:38] <%mastertwin2> Does unseen aid not count the death towards dragonrot?
[0:06:38] <+KrippSubBot> @angriestpat which means u can usually coward out with ur last life and lose nothing.
[0:06:47] <%MelancholicMasochist> I do feel that sekiro has more unfair occurrences than the other souls games
[0:06:51] <nukle0nik> bologna
[0:06:52] <%Kurt_0> where did you get the third pip from
[0:07:00] <kiryuva> @AngriestPat this is super random, but Genichiro is voiced by Kenjiro Tsuda, who voices Seto Kaiba in Yu-Gi-Oh and Tiziano from Golden Wind! effBanger
[0:07:01] <$HentaiSenpai9K> Where is the Mustard Empress?
[0:07:04] <%galaxyswirl> @MelancholicMasochist it does
[0:07:10] <TheOneUpWarrior> did he find the bell demon?
[0:07:16] <kiryuva> he does a lot of characters!
[0:07:21] <%MelancholicMasochist> near the ends some things are extremely unfair
[0:07:23] <etalmeta> @mastertwin2 it only helps keep your exp and maybe money

[0:08:01] <%blankwaffle> my boi pat!
[0:08:02] <%brickwall35> Unrelated, what are the chances we get to see you with a handlebar mustache, @angriestpat
[0:08:03] <%MelancholicMasochist> mainly in relation to the bosses which will take 70% of you health in 1 shot every time

[0:08:34] <stabbityrabbit> I know I asked a few times yesterday, did Pat ever see the new VTM:Bloodlines trailer? Don't wanna @ him if he already mentioned it.

[0:09:09] <%Typhaeon> Hey Pat, did you find out how to break your vow yet?
[0:09:13] <%connos_livereview> Hope VTMB2 runs better than the first one
[0:09:18] <Flurbleman44> But you have a sweet sword
[0:09:26] <%Jetsfantasy> Thanks pat, didn't mean to interrupt. Just wanted to get back in
[0:09:26] <%Bigshimz> Does this game have a lot of numbers?
[0:09:26] <%rumtumtugnutz> sounds like someone didn't like the game because everyone else did.
[0:09:34] <DatAsuna> @AngriestPat I missed he last stream, how far in are ya?
[0:09:34] <%Typhaeon> I don't have it, I was just curious based on what that NPC said
[0:09:36] <+PenmanLupine> I kind of wish there were more Kill animations than just a handful. I know they're different for different creatures but it looks monotonous when your fighting a group
[0:10:04] <%Typhaeon> Ooh, aah
[0:10:13] <+WorldsBestPanda> BIG grind!
[0:10:13] <Marpolo13> :)
[0:10:17] <$Tarcanist_> masks are good really good
[0:10:20] <fairore> dont force yourself to play a game that's popular
[0:10:30] <DatAsuna> Seeing the travel screen gave me a rough idea

[0:13:03] <%Bigshimz> This game looks a lot more satisfying than From Software's other titles.
[0:13:09] <+Tokanova> this is kinda like a souls game... i wonder if there was a quest to save them?

[0:13:50] <stabbityrabbit> @sshen I really don't think it should be put in the same category as character-action. I remember the term precision-action which I think fits better.
[0:13:51] <%Varnarok> The Bell Demon is on the monk place. Before the Armored Guy, go left and jump down
[0:13:55] <+Zereaux> its just the gargoyale

[0:39:22] <Dragon_Batman> Black hat said it would help with bullets nad maybe cannons
[0:39:32] <Dragon_Batman> and*
[0:39:45] <%Fenrirlives> @AngriestPat Umbrella let's you wait out multiple attacks and leaves the enemy open for you to go on the offensive
[0:39:46] <%frankthetank285> frankthetank285 subscribed at Tier 1. They've subscribed for 6 months! Pat do u think p5 royal might be a fighting game
[0:40:03] <%Stratiotai2> these mans are murdering you florida man style
[0:40:12] <Tucker0603> @angriestpat I think it's meant to counter projectiles, and can't you hold it out without an additional cost?
[0:40:18] <Thalchampz> LUL
[0:40:25] <%alexandrecau> you tried
[0:40:31] <arfsm95> @AngriestPat you can stealth the shotgun guy, there's a way to get around, it has to do with the buddah statue

[0:41:29] <$cdrom321> This is an excellent Souls game.
[0:41:31] <+walnutcast> @AngriestPat the drop assassination is more noticeable than dropping down THEN assassinating i've learned

[0:42:02] <VRNK> if there's a snake eyes is there also a dog eyes?
[0:42:17] <slyarvicle08> Do you think sekiro will win as best game in some game awards? @AngriestPat
[0:42:18] <arfsm95> @AngriestPat the charged shot does no damage to the umbrella, even if it's not a parry i think
[0:42:20] <$cureneckbeard> just cut up his gun with your sword
[0:42:28] <$cureneckbeard> katanas can cut through even machine gun barrels
[0:42:29] <+highfivepotater> Dog eye's

[0:43:52] <AmericanaRed> BibleThump
[0:43:53] <+matrixManipulator> is that really long slow attack with the end of the gun a sweep? should pat be jumping?
[0:43:55] <%alexandrecau> throw ashes in his snake eyes
[0:44:07] <Marpolo13> @brickwall35 what if it's a gunblade? Keepo
[0:44:09] <Thalchampz> @mayorrev don't lose your shit when you die
[0:44:10] <+mysterypork> Seems like you can avoid the grab by dodging right
[0:44:10] <arfsm95> @AngriestPat not this, statue, the one on the other end

[1:11:49] <Darmarock> Shoul've gone for a plunging attack
[1:11:49] <Dragon_Batman> The game seems to enforce a bit of cowardice
[1:11:51] <+eanscrale> That's literally what ninjas do
[1:11:51] <%d00med_magus> DATTEBAYO
[1:11:52] <baronvonbirman> That is every ninjas's way
[1:11:52] <%MagickBurritoh> got to go further away

[1:12:13] <+8framelag> backstab, run away and repeat
[1:12:13] <thecasket> Remember that fucked up Russian translation of MGSV that described a sneaking mission as a "coward mission"?
[1:12:13] <+PenmanLupine> ape shit shinobis are kinda not a thing

[1:26:56] <%Generic_NPC_Name> Generic_NPC_Name subscribed with Twitch Prime. 
[1:26:58] <arfsm95> @AngriestPat i mean, it has to be like that because you basically move 3D now, not only a path
[1:26:59] <adamparker_cig> i wish i could relive finding ash lake for the first time
[1:27:04] <%Sir_Gawain_Lotsson> @thecasket PS4 or PS4 Pro?

[1:27:36] <PowerfulBlackGangs> Shadowrush sounds ooler
[1:27:38] <%Sir_Gawain_Lotsson> @thecasket Probably not much better than a minimum-spec PC then

[1:27:42] <+bobtailedmango> ichi 2 is pretty good
[1:27:43] <%lewdskeletor13> Follow your heart Pat

[1:27:49] <+Kangumosa> the chug buff is worth it
[1:27:51] <Aruvella> The rush is a Stinger.

[1:27:57] <%MagickBurritoh> Chuff
[1:27:58] <arfsm95> @AngriestPat the ichimonji tree is good for posture right?
[1:27:59] <thecasket> @Sir_Gawain_Lotsson Jeez, that bad then? Maybe I'll just have to sit on it for a while.
[1:28:01] <%MagickBurritoh> the CHUFF
[1:28:03] <$valriot> c h u g
[1:28:05] <danknugglit> Double ichi does crazy posture damage
[1:28:07] <+TheSaintJohn> you'll get them all eventually
[1:28:08] <Shishi1205> Kill a cock or 2 to get 4
[1:28:09] <Ravenian96> I think chug is smart
[1:28:12] <adamparker_cig> buff chug your chug buff
[1:28:16] <$valriot> Think you chug enough Kappa

[1:28:33] <$valriot> Chug those cocks
[1:28:34] <PowerfulBlackGangs> Almost
[1:28:34] <adamparker_cig> cock joke
[1:28:35] <$Tarcanist_> it seem like the castle is the center and it just shoots out paths in varying directions @angriestpat
[1:28:37] <%Ion_Laser> LUL

[1:28:50] <%owl_jack> thanks for the sound bites
[1:28:51] <%Ion_Laser> apatSmug
[1:28:53] <%d00med_magus> have you seen so many clocks in one place pat
[1:28:53] <Dragon_Batman> DeathBlowing cocks is a good way to gain experience
[1:28:53] <%lewdskeletor13> HE SAID THE THING
[1:28:56] <Jalexster> I wonder if this game has multiple endings? It took a little while for Bloodborne's third ending to be found, didn't it?
[1:28:56] <mayorrev> Weird flex but ok
[1:28:59] <gustavozxd> so these cocks show up in every single level of the game?
[1:29:00] <danknugglit> Hes real
[1:29:00] <MrGarettLefebvre> Pat gets the most experience with big black cocks
[1:29:02] <jerobees> Grab the cock and make is spray
[1:29:03] <%lewdskeletor13> I CLAPPED
[1:29:07] <%Sir_Gawain_Lotsson> @thecasket It's conjecture on my part, but bloodborne runs bad on PS4 and only okay on PS4 Pro. Sekiro ran okay for Pat's first stream and he's on a PS4 Pro. You won't get 60 fps even on a pro though.
[1:29:08] <MadOx__> How do people deal with the headless enemy types? i just strait up never killed them
[1:29:09] <Dia_Dar> @AngriestPat is it better to get the game for ps4 or PC ?
[1:29:14] <FiftyFiveP> isn;t this headless dude the guy the sign thing was warning of early in the game
[1:29:16] <gustavozxd> is the CockLord the final boss
[1:29:17] <$valriot> need to get those black cocks for more chug
[1:29:19] <arfsm95> @AngriestPat fun fact, the ichimonji way is like the one with the main antagonist that cuts your arm, "fuck honor JUST WIN"
[1:29:21] <Shishi1205> Can you jump execute him? @AngriestPat That would be a nice way to get rid of a pip
[1:29:25] <adamparker_cig> forest = night time
[1:29:29] <VRNK> ｔｉｍｅ ｆｌｏｗｓ ｓｔｒａｎｇｅｌｙ ｉｎ ｔｈｅ ｌａｎｄ ｏｆ ａｓｈｉｎａ
[1:29:43] <blackjackskellington> must get something real good from those headless
[1:29:45] <danknugglit> Time is convoluted in japan Kappa
[1:29:46] <mr_hunter> relations shift and obscure
[1:29:56] <aimlesshealer> chuggbutt
[1:30:05] <%MagickBurritoh> chuff
[1:30:10] <adamparker_cig> skill trees?!
[1:30:11] <HorribleHog> god i want this to have some tie-ins to souls, and i hate it
[1:30:19] <mr_hunter> CHUGG PogChamp
[1:30:30] <gustavozxd> how many different arms did Pat get so far?
[1:30:32] <adamparker_cig> this is just that eastern land that DS1 talks about
[1:30:37] <$HentaiSenpai9K> @horriblehog Im sure it does
[1:30:38] <mr_ESB> Meow?
[1:30:38] <hypoid77> these poor chickens
[1:30:39] <leole11> did you just parry that cock ?
[1:30:42] <%MagickBurritoh> it's frobably just in the future or past
[1:30:47] <$valriot> Ashina Lake
[1:30:48] <%MagickBurritoh> washing pole?
[1:30:48] <lizard0tm> It seems more like it'd tie into Bloodborne
[1:30:51] <Darren716> Imagine if this was the Eastern Land
[1:30:52] <+matrixManipulator> MOONLIGHT DAIKATANA
[1:30:53] <mr_ESB> Oh roosters
[1:30:56] <Gabbtrap> Artorias' Sword
[1:30:57] <+TheSaintJohn> Shiva of the east reference
[1:30:57] <jerobees> "This strange sword is from a western land"
[1:30:58] <+8framelag> souls community would rage
[1:31:04] <Jrockoni> we already got that one guy whose legit undead
[1:31:07] <mayorrev> poor chickens ;-;
[1:31:08] <%Sir_Gawain_Lotsson> Have Flame be a cure for Dragonrot @AngriestPat
[1:31:09] <Dragon_Batman> Some strange coin or something
[1:31:10] <%lewdskeletor13> Isn’t this based on real world stuff though?
[1:31:10] <blackjackskellington> secret boss is a bloodborne hunter?
[1:31:11] <MrGarettLefebvre> A piece of armor from a far away land
[1:31:12] <Apocalypse89> Isn't the issue that this is straight up Japan while Souls was a 100% fantasy world
[1:31:12] <gustavozxd> one item be a PEBBLE
[1:31:15] <Mnightshyamallama> I think it would be better for Fromsoft if they didn't tie every game to Dark Souls
[1:31:15] <Shishi1205> More like shiva of the deceased
[1:31:16] <primarch_lupercal> it probs bloodborne with all the talk of blood
[1:31:18] <adamparker_cig> why is the elbow an axe
[1:31:19] <$valriot> Vaati would cum in his convict pants
[1:31:22] <%drdemenz> drdemenz subscribed with Twitch Prime. 
[1:31:22] <arfsm95> @AngriestPat like the ceramic things you're throwing are ACTUALLY lord vessel parts
[1:31:25] <HorribleHog> We await the return of Lord Kuro's father, ALONNE
[1:31:26] <danknugglit> Sekiros outfit looks like that guy from the bb dlc in the cell @angriestpat
[1:31:26] <%GarbageNirvana> I mean I'm not saying Souls writers are lazy, but
[1:31:28] <VRNK> and its the bonfire sword
[1:31:29] <%MagickBurritoh> or a red orb that does nothing

[1:31:51] <mayorrev> SEKIRO ROYALE
[1:31:54] <%ace_cfa44> there was a bloodborne reference that max showed off last night on stream
[1:31:56] <lizard0tm> @AngriestPat The game probably ties into Bloodborne better
[1:31:57] <adamparker_cig> Sekiro man finds a lord vessel and is like "what is this pot"
[1:31:59] <jacksawjack> I just wonder if they shoehorned in the Moonlight Greatsword as usual.
[1:32:01] <mayorrev> imagine Sekiro BR
[1:32:06] <ShichiNoBushi> Space is convoluted in Nippon?
[1:32:08] <Shishi1205> Did the mic do a strange sound about a minute ago?
[1:32:09] <arfsm95> @AngriestPat you think moonlight greatsword and "patches" will show up?
[1:32:10] <Shishi1205> Like a pop
[1:32:13] <+Flambage> I want something super stupid and overt like Onion Knight being lost and asking you for directions to Anor Londo @AngriestPat
[1:32:14] <lizard0tm> There's already references to bloodstones n shit
[1:32:15] <HorribleHog> Sekiro eats ramen out of the lordvessel
[1:32:18] <jerobees> MLGS is eternal
[1:32:21] <Apocalypse89> Unless they retcon it so Souls takes place in magic Germany or something
[1:32:22] <Basch71> or Alonne just fucking around in japan before becoming a weeb knight
[1:32:29] <%lewdskeletor13> Since this is based off Japan would that imply Dark Souls happened in the past?
[1:32:29] <adamparker_cig> i fucking hope Patches shoves you off a cliff and laughs about it
[1:32:31] <Jrockoni> how long before Moonlit Nodachi
[1:32:32] <rabbi2himself> Loving the Tenchu elements to this games. Makes me want FromSoftware and Acquire to make a new one.

[1:32:36] <+Kangumosa> imb4 the final boss is a dragon
[1:32:36] <PowerfulBlackGangs> We've all been there
[1:32:47] <jerobees> Time to break some borks
[1:32:48] <gustavozxd> dark souls battle royale would be just a bunch of dudes rolling around each other until someone gets ass stabbed
[1:32:48] <adamparker_cig> many dogs
[1:33:00] <Shishi1205> You need to be snuffed
[1:33:02] <$valriot> SNUFFED

[1:33:08] <Shortnamer> @AngriestPat or just slap a cult that praises the sun in and you're good Kappa
[1:33:09] <MrGarettLefebvre> Pat would you like to see a remake of Demon's Souls with inspirations from this game?
[1:33:09] <cbdg> vissRage

[1:33:50] <%ScreamingMeat> "This strange sword from a foreign seems to have no special properties, but is impeccably maintained with a Sun etched into the hilt of the blade. Sunlight seems to reflect brightly from it's surface."

[1:34:21] <GreyFoxHoundDD> Nope, he's just some dude
[1:34:21] <ShichiNoBushi> He's just a tough guy.
[1:34:21] <Dr_Mooose> badass approaches
[1:34:21] <mrgrimsmiles> he has one arm
[1:34:23] <kiryuva> water shinobi!

[1:34:38] <gustavozxd> the sword fights in this game look godlike damn
[1:34:39] <Dragon_Batman> nope
[1:34:41] <Shishi1205> Seems like it
[1:34:43] <Ravenian96> Who is cutting off everyone's left arm?!?!
[1:34:43] <complicatedclarity> Oh fuck that guy isn't fucking around
[1:34:49] <HorribleHog> lewdskeletor13 Jpdodds Ok, cool, then we should be fine on the tie-in front
[1:34:51] <@Moobot> Whoa I don't even shout that much! (@LeeOhX) (warning)
[1:34:54] <Eresus> he has a smelly hand
[1:34:55] <+Evitron1> was that guy about to take a sippy?
[1:34:57] <jerobees> Valriot, like the kind for stabbing sharks?
[1:34:59] <LeeOhX> This is the shopkeeper!
[1:35:00] <kiryuva> i think he has two arms, the other one is just hidden by how dark it is.
[1:35:01] <%Rakenshin> BAKANA
[1:35:03] <GreyFoxHoundDD> Yeah, this guy comes back when you rest, so if you want to train on him, you can
[1:35:04] <adamparker_cig> MORTIS
[1:35:04] <Apocalypse89> @HorribleHog The intro mentions that the game takes place in the Sengoku period, and Buddhism is a thing
[1:35:05] <%MagickBurritoh> he has a face
[1:35:08] <LeeOhX> FROM DS1
[1:35:08] <Dragon_Batman> I wonder if it's another prosthetic
[1:35:09] <%zafooru> just tuning in, is this game a dark souls?
[1:35:09] <cbdg> what a cool guy
[1:35:10] <Shishi1205> You can execute him now

[1:35:39] <graemecrackers1> use the aping system
[1:35:47] <aimlesshealer> It'd be funny if some enemies started looting your corpse
[1:35:48] <%Sir_Gawain_Lotsson> @AngriestPat are you going through the game resurrecting the first time and planning on doing a no-resurrection playthrough to avoid Dragonrot? or is that not how Dragonrot works?
[1:35:48] <graemecrackers1> zapping#
[1:35:49] <adamparker_cig> that is totally the BB axe heavy attack

[1:36:23] <%kenpachi9211> so just caught up death count 133
[1:36:24] <%ScreamingMeat> I don't like how the trailers implied that you can use Resurrection to sneak up on enemies and finish them off. Because I've tried that and it never works, they are alerted by it every time
[1:36:26] <medril07> the hell is that thing?

[1:49:26] <Dragon_Batman> That place is a fuck
[1:49:28] <Shishi1205> This place is a hellhole
[1:49:36] <%Reizie_Etherealm> @arfsm95 Yes, it does
[1:49:39] <deviljhojho94> on the inside
[1:49:41] <Mnightshyamallama> I like the idea of this place being strength in absolute numbers, you didn't see that often in souls
[1:49:46] <arfsm95> @Reizie_Etherealm i see, thanks
[1:49:48] <gustavozxd> from the first NIOH 2 trailer it looks like you'll actually transform into an oni which sounds awesome
[1:49:52] <stabbityrabbit> Wait, so hollows are Sekiro's skeletons. Huh.
[1:49:56] <VRNK> eyes from the lake, because that's gone REALLY WELL BEFORE
[1:49:56] <Shishi1205> I bet that carp is big
[1:49:59] <cbdg> SabaPing
[1:50:04] <Dragon_Batman> How does one aquire that tho
[1:50:06] <arfsm95> @AngriestPat again with eyes and bodies of whater, i think sekiro ties in more with bloodborne than souls
[1:50:08] <+mysterypork> Go fish
[1:50:09] <ChoculaUltra> those treasure carp or fighty carp?
[1:50:13] <complicatedclarity> weeaboo lake?

[1:50:45] <reonome> man fucking everything kills you
[1:50:46] <ChoculaUltra> Nemo can catch these hands too, idgaf
[1:50:48] <Staplecrab> this game feels like it has a bunch of horror elements similar to bloodborne
[1:50:49] <Shishi1205> Pat doing a favour to society by getting rid of the elderly thanks pat @AngriestPat
[1:50:49] <MrMysteryMask> kill them get their scales
[1:50:52] <GreyFoxHoundDD> @Nighthawkmun It's all offline

[1:50:56] <stabbityrabbit> WAIT. What is Jean Sekiro's arm made out of?
[1:50:58] <Dragon_Batman> I wouldn't be surprised if there is one in there to fool you

[1:51:26] <Tucker0603> @angriestpat maybe the dragon is an old one considering Japanese Dragons are tied to water
[1:51:27] <arfsm95> @AngriestPat do you think the moonlight or patches will show up?
[1:51:29] <$SGrim> @stabbityrabbit looks like stone, rope, and wood
[1:51:30] <mrgrimsmiles> funnel time?
[1:51:32] <Staplecrab> is it made of bones or did the sculptor just sculpt wood to look like bone?
[1:51:36] <limeyprick> remember when vaati thought it was some instrument or something?
[1:51:37] <ChoculaUltra> that'd be some p strong porcelain
[1:51:39] <%MagickBurritoh> Glowgrass

[1:52:42] <Nina96> is that a Kappa?
[1:52:43] <medril07> I don't think Vaati is going to be able to analyse much from this game
[1:52:47] <Shishi1205> Dip right now
[1:52:48] <deviljhojho94> just dont
[1:52:54] <+WorldsBestPanda> What if they ahve a thing?
[1:52:54] <complicatedclarity> nah
[1:52:57] <Saltmeisterr> TERROR
[1:52:57] <+hoenhime344> coward and a pussy
[1:52:58] <+Vgmaestr01> Blood of the Dragon is a way better name than blood vials
[1:53:03] <$HentaiSenpai9K> You'll have to go there eventually
[1:53:17] <limeyprick> Vaati's livelihood is secure for another 2-3 years now
[1:53:18] <%lewdskeletor13> Cowardice is the best tactic in this game it seems
[1:53:20] <$HentaiSenpai9K> You can't escape
[1:53:20] <arfsm95> @AngriestPat imagine the plot twist where, all the people with the dragon blood that died are in a crypt, because they are the same family, and that's where later, people find the beast blood from yarnam
[1:53:23] <$valriot> Now i know why Pat doesnt play Mario games
[1:53:31] <Ravenian96> Sekiro: You think you want to live forever, but damn that's a fucked up way to it.
[1:53:40] <+hoenhime344> lol no it isnt, parrying and being good is the best tactic

[1:58:58] <+SpectrumSpy> A real bitch, heyoooo
[1:58:58] <$SGrim> @AngriestPat divine confetti's gonna be the on you'll wanna use.
[1:59:00] <+Zereaux> doesnt he kill a village every time he ressurects
[1:59:03] <ChoculaUltra> if she were a ghost ghost, the insanity/terror meter would be on screen
[1:59:03] <VRNK> i love how she moves tho
[1:59:04] <+twohitgood> can you talk to her and tell her what she wants to hear or does everything trigger this fight?
[1:59:12] <Shishi1205> If she's of the river maybe fire might help?
[1:59:13] <ChoculaUltra> she's just ghostly.
[1:59:19] <nerdblase> A sprinkle of Divine Confetti might help.
[1:59:26] <%MelBrooksKA> @SGrim He's a bit busy at the moment
[1:59:28] <baesoora> looks like a ghastly dancer of the Boreal
[1:59:30] <baesoora> lmao
[1:59:32] <Dragon_Batman> That might be why they give you one in the village then
[1:59:34] <jerobees> Water puts out fire tho
[1:59:42] <$HentaiSenpai9K> Do a barrel rool
[1:59:43] <complicatedclarity> maybe she'll leave you alone if you give her some Lord ectoplasm
[1:59:44] <Shishi1205> I expect great things from the execute
[1:59:47] <%Varnarok> @baesoora Wait until you see the boss he's working his way up to then

[1:59:49] <Dehlome> getting there
[1:59:50] <Stay_Hydrated_Bot> @angriestpat stayhyBottle You've been live for just over 2 hours. By this point in your broadcast you should have consumed at least 8oz (240mL) of water to maintain optimum hydration.
[1:59:51] <PowerfulBlackGangs> Almost
[1:59:57] <%Rakenshin> @nerdblase Those are limited, can't buy them
[2:00:01] <$SGrim> @MelBrooksKA which is a shame because you only do like 20% damage on her without it./

[2:00:42] <complicatedclarity> pat got gud
[2:00:44] <leole11> by dark souls, since she has invincibility frames
[2:00:47] <Shishi1205> Does she only sweep?
[2:00:49] <Parapattern> Okay Sekiro, to get your lord back, you're gonna have to go over and suck Genichiro's dick.
[2:00:52] <%MagickBurritoh> She's transparent
[2:01:03] <spankadelic_> jumping on her head like a goomba
[2:01:06] <CybertronPrime> So from what I understand by watching this, this is less about whittling away at their health and more about playijg defensive until you knock them off balance, then go for big damage?
[2:01:24] <%Reizie_Etherealm> I can confirm that this is a "Yuki-onna" type ghost from the Japanese folklore
[2:01:24] <Valentinius_Anodyne> Depends on the enemy, as far as I can tell
[2:01:25] <Ner234> @CybertronPrime Yes
[2:01:26] <Shishi1205> I mean If they have big boi posture go for health
[2:01:30] <+Sorathecrow> why does she have a trash can on her head
[2:01:33] <+twohitgood> she's not transparent, she has a fog about her.
[2:01:36] <Dragon_Batman> Don't go talking shit, you eat it everytime you do
[2:01:37] <Saltmeisterr> does she count as a apparition?
[2:01:38] <%Fadedblank247> yo got this

[2:09:00] <+Kangumosa> Smough with the big kat
[2:09:10] <+matrixManipulator> some enemies seem to spot you fast, but can you leave and come back and try to sneak?
[2:09:13] <+Dragon4234> @AngriestPat You can get into the temple under the floorboards on the right side
[2:09:18] <cbdg> does pat not have a soul at all then
[2:09:20] <pigeontactician> like the folks bred for sumo, but with fantasy exaggeration
[2:09:20] <Ravenian96> All human bosses in souls are at least five feet taller than you LOL
[2:09:21] <$HentaiSenpai9K> Oh man I dont know if Paige could play this LUL
[2:09:30] <thecasket> what's the explanation for the really small people?

[2:09:38] <+Zereaux> i thinkk this is too much for paige
[2:09:38] <$megamonmon123> maybe it has something to do with dragons?
[2:09:41] <PerrinIsDead> Whos gourding??
[2:09:47] <GreyFoxHoundDD> Because Japanese artists decided to make people that were strong ENORMOUS in their portraits.
[2:09:49] <complicatedclarity> they're filled to bursting with the juice of their enemies
[2:09:50] <Tucker0603> @angriestpat hey Pat, what if the dragon is related to an old one since Japanese Dragons deal a lot with water.
[2:09:54] <%ThDark> There's some decent items in the temple with the glug glug guy, gotta sneak under the floor @AngriestPat
[2:09:55] <TioXyco> Harada estate?
[2:09:55] <Dragon_Batman> Maybe not, It was burning down no?
[2:09:57] <$SGrim> @thecasket they have no soul. Like Ginger Patty, here. LuL
[2:10:01] <+Michael_Erazo> Are you still playing Division 2 Pat?

[2:10:23] <thecasket> @SGrim @HentaiSenpai9K Pats and Rats
[2:10:33] <%Mateus84723> What if the dragon is a 10 year old girl?
[2:10:33] <%El_Desperad0> it's meh
[2:10:33] <%Reizie_Etherealm> Because of this
[2:10:38] <+BritishMango> game looks incredible
[2:10:41] <boostergoldz> I highly doubt there's any connection to bloodborne.
[2:10:44] <ShichiNoBushi> Chinese Dragons have 4 talons except the imperial ones which have 5. Japanese Dragons have 3 talons.
[2:10:51] <+8framelag> no, only 1000 year old girls
[2:10:57] <endlessdream9> do chinese dragons have large talons?
[2:10:58] <%Reizie_Etherealm> "What was that?"
[2:11:02] <%Nobrev> pat will never answer that guys question

[2:11:26] <DraxTD> "DISAPOINTMENT!"
[2:11:26] <stabbityrabbit> There was also references to a many headed snake in Bloodborne. I wouldn't be surprised if it turned out to be a super fucked orochi in Sekiro.
[2:11:26] <thecasket> "What was that noise?"
[2:11:27] <+Das_Prints> There was an interact point.
[2:11:28] <+AXL808> congratulations you've discovered a not-secret

[2:14:33] <$HentaiSenpai9K> Yup
[2:14:38] <deviljhojho94> This truly was the bloodborne 2
[2:14:39] <+Ell1ot> you said Dark souls yesterday
[2:14:41] <%MagickBurritoh> What's the insight in this game?
[2:14:41] <HorribleHog> I notice the english voice acting isn't delivered with as much gusto
[2:14:41] <Shortnamer> MORE EYES
[2:14:42] <complicatedclarity> find him love nectar from the gods
[2:14:43] <nukle0nik> everyone's spealing in total batshit nutty
[2:14:44] <arfsm95> @AngriestPat imagine the plot twist where, all the people with the dragon blood that died are in a crypt, because they are the same family, and that's where later, people find the beast blood from yarnam
[2:14:44] <%connos_livereview> ENOUGH TO MAKE A MAN SICk
[2:14:48] <%Fenrirlives> @PrincessRubyyy the rope and paper around his neck are distinctly Shinto artifacts
[2:14:49] <nukle0nik> so yeah it's a fromsoft game
[2:14:52] <mrgrimsmiles> another bell?
[2:14:53] <+Kangumosa> GULPborne
[2:14:55] <dukenux> Sekiro is truly the Bloodborne of Dark Souls
[2:14:55] <stabbityrabbit> At this point I wouldn't be surprised if this WAS Bloodborne 2.
[2:14:55] <PrincessRubyyy> @Fenrirlives Oh cool thanks!
[2:14:56] <+iamsalinas> *Bloodborne intensifies*
[2:15:01] <Shishi1205> Ooo
[2:15:06] <TwinBat> @HorribleHog that's usually the deal with most dubs
[2:15:08] <$NocturneNovember> One more to go!
[2:15:08] <PrincessRubyyy> @Fenrirlives is Shinto bad?
[2:15:09] <Staplecrab> beads Kreygasm
[2:15:12] <deviljhojho94> My bead now :)
[2:15:15] <devanmuse> This game is about Blood that makes you IMMORTAL! I'm waiting to see that the "Dragon" this blood came from is some Ebrietas looking mother fucker
[2:15:18] <@Moobot> Whoa I don't even shout that much! (@medril07)
[2:15:20] <%sabertoothzombie> did he beat the monk?
[2:15:27] <$HentaiSenpai9K> Yup what @TwinBat said
[2:15:30] <adamparker_cig> good job you lost that arm or youd never do this
[2:15:36] <nukle0nik> that's now how you fish
[2:15:39] <+Kangumosa> ah the elusive water mob
[2:15:44] <Ravenian96> LUL
[2:15:44] <Shishi1205> Being able to swim is wild in a from soft game
[2:15:45] <SnaKemuho> @devanmuse they show it later, but it's not really blood
[2:15:46] <dukenux> Hope Plague will make some Sekiro animations, btw
[2:15:47] <+AXL808> fishy business
[2:15:49] <deviljhojho94> it really does
[2:15:49] <Saltmeisterr> ah yes water combat
[2:15:54] <linkwolf4> I just wonder how they're gonna shove the moonlight greatsword into this game.
[2:15:55] <graemecrackers1> mmmm sushi
[2:15:58] <arfsm95> @AngriestPat imagine the plot twist where, all the people with the dragon blood that died are in a crypt, because they are the same family, and that's where later, people find the beast blood from yarnam
[2:16:04] <%Fenrirlives> @PrincessRubyyy no it's an animist religion in Japan, but it had a big conflict with Buddhism back in ancient times like this time period
[2:16:07] <%Gogogolem> @AngriestPat But pat don't you want the the ultimate weapon?
[2:16:07] <PrincessRubyyy> @linkwolf4 They don't
[2:16:14] <PrincessRubyyy> @Fenrirlives Cool thanks
[2:16:15] <AlasterAngelo> god i hope this doesn't tie into bloodborne
[2:16:17] <%MagickBurritoh> Check that flor chalk
[2:16:18] <%Remery_> Remery_ subscribed at Tier 1. They've subscribed for 27 months! Do you think this game would be better if you could switch your primary weapon? Playing with just a normal Katana gets boring after a while.
[2:16:20] <Death_by_moogle> Yo
[2:16:21] <Dragon_Batman> Interesting
[2:16:25] <GreyFoxHoundDD> Yo, go back up into the attic?
[2:16:25] <nukle0nik> force field
[2:16:26] <Shishi1205> Ghost power
[2:16:26] <$HentaiSenpai9K> hmmmm
[2:16:27] <AlasterAngelo> trying to connect to previous games is what made DS2 and 3 so bad
[2:16:28] <$NocturneNovember> Illusion?
[2:16:29] <og_stel> love train monkaS
[2:16:29] <Tucker0603> Use a snap see
[2:16:29] <jerobees> Ghost
[2:16:32] <GreyFoxHoundDD> What's up there?
[2:16:33] <+AXL808> The power of divine confetti
[2:16:33] <OrochiSheewa> plot armor
[2:16:34] <Tucker0603> Snap seed
[2:16:34] <%StEmlosWater> @linkwolf4 Miyazaki didn't write this game. No MGS or Patches
[2:16:35] <+8framelag> hmmm
[2:16:36] <+matrixManipulator> Illusion?
[2:16:36] <SnaKemuho> @AlasterAngelo it doesn't
[2:16:40] <+Ell1ot> you can't get past his ghost juice
[2:16:45] <GoldeNOVA> Go back!
[2:16:48] <HorribleHog> TwinBat I know, it's just that with the history of fromsoft using english (british) voices, it's a curious choice to have different dubs when previous games were (unless i'm mistaken) dubbed in only a single language
[2:16:49] <AlasterAngelo> STOP KILLING HIS JUICE
[2:16:49] <GoldeNOVA> There's a white pool of something
[2:16:57] <%El_Desperad0> @AlasterAngelo apatBig Agree
[2:16:59] <+InfiniteHav0k> @InfiniteHav0k is new here. Say hello! VoHiYo

[2:17:26] <+Kangumosa> BACK INSIDE
[2:17:26] <dukenux> Well, previous From games were set in mainly "western" fantasy world, while this is very much fantastic version of feudal Japan
[2:17:27] <Gabbtrap> Something on the top roof
[2:17:28] <%Reizie_Etherealm> Maybe the restorative water corrupted all these people? And they're super addicted to it? That's why they're outside wanting to get into building?
[2:17:35] <nukle0nik> GIANT HOLE
[2:17:37] <+Ell1ot> this suit... it burns better... look!
[2:17:39] <GoldeNOVA> Near the guy there's a white pool of something

[2:18:13] <%ThDark> You bleed the temple dry
[2:18:13] <ChoculaUltra> the revolving ninja walls are the best spin on the illusory walls

[2:18:57] <Shortnamer> @ThDark yes
[2:18:58] <complicatedclarity> @thdark yeah
[2:19:06] <nukle0nik> it says corrupted monk but he's wearing the garb of a nun
[2:19:06] <GoldeNOVA> Ohhh
[2:19:08] <FiftyFiveP> maybe divine confetti against this guy once you're used to him
[2:19:12] <Shishi1205> At least he doesn't apply terror
[2:19:17] <%ThDark> Ah, got here a bit late, thanks!
[2:19:19] <AlasterAngelo> this isn't a monkey thats the other boss
[2:19:19] <dukenux> Is this monk a miniboss?
[2:19:24] <nukle0nik> the sweeps, the creeps, the beeps
[2:19:25] <+Kangumosa> No
[2:19:30] <+Kangumosa> He is a boss
[2:19:30] <Shishi1205> Is it me or does he have a tengu mask?
[2:19:37] <dukenux> alrigh t
[2:19:39] <reonome> @nukle0nik dude he's a japanese monk
[2:19:39] <Shishi1205> Or some kinda lookalike
[2:19:44] <Saltmeisterr> is this a refight?
[2:19:45] <Dragon_Batman> He just stiff armed that swipe, neat
[2:19:46] <complicatedclarity> who the he'll is lord sakuza that he's got badass ghost fanboys
[2:19:46] <GoldeNOVA> Can you poison him?
[2:19:52] <%Reizie_Etherealm> It has reach but you have flexibility
[2:20:03] <arfsm95> @Shishi1205 it looks more like a hannya to m
[2:20:04] <+burgersama_dlx> Is this guy a One Piece character?
[2:20:05] <nukle0nik> @reonome there's buddhist nuns too
[2:20:08] <+Zereaux> wait isnt sekiro man a nin j why is not abble to didge?
[2:20:08] <%MagickBurritoh> only 1 pip
[2:20:09] <AlasterAngelo> japanese monks slightly less cool than chinese monks
[2:20:10] <+Kangumosa> that fake out
[2:20:20] <+bullcowski> So is it just me or is this game just "do it perfect or fuck you"?
[2:20:20] <GoldeNOVA> Japanese Guan Yu
[2:20:21] <+Kangumosa> 1 pip but a metric butt tonne of health
[2:20:25] <Shishi1205> yeah, He has no nose for sure
[2:20:27] <+Ondartyr> Also, what the hell is this guy's weapon even?
[2:20:27] <nukle0nik> he's got a tiny head
[2:20:28] <mrgrimsmiles> i think you need to confitee him
[2:20:36] <+Zereaux> naginataq
[2:20:36] <reonome> @nukle0nik yes but they dress similarly
[2:20:39] <Shishi1205> Kinda of a naginata
[2:20:41] <%MagickBurritoh> Why aren't you using your shield Pat
[2:20:45] <+Kangumosa> you can sleeze all bosses by sprinting and baiting their lunges for a cheesy hit
[2:20:48] <nukle0nik> naginata but with a ridiculously long blade
[2:20:50] <Dragon_Batman> He takes very little posture damage
[2:20:58] <%Rakenshin> Spinning always works
[2:20:58] <dukenux> He looks like a Dynasty Warriors
[2:21:02] <+Ondartyr> If that's a naginata it's compensating for something.
[2:21:04] <Shishi1205> You better whitle down his health
[2:21:05] <Ner234> I Think that's nagamaki or ss\omething
[2:21:07] <+Kangumosa> all bosses take limited posture damage until you drain their health
[2:21:10] <deviljhojho94> thats a woman
[2:21:12] <deviljhojho94> no?
[2:21:12] <Shishi1205> his posture is going nowhere
[2:21:17] <%Reizie_Etherealm> Naginata?
[2:21:19] <Shishi1205> The voice is strange
[2:21:21] <Glitterplague> am I hearing a woman's laugh?
[2:21:21] <AlasterAngelo> pretty sure thats a dude
[2:21:22] <deviljhojho94> naginata
[2:21:24] <Shishi1205> but it does say monk
[2:21:27] <dukenux> and it says monk
[2:21:28] <deviljhojho94> sounds like a woman
[2:21:30] <+frosty_yaya> would they take more damage with the confetti equipped?
[2:21:36] <Parapattern> I wonder if fire would do something
[2:21:40] <+PrimordialDonut> Thats a woman
[2:21:41] <nukle0nik> the headdress is more like that of a buddhist nun than a monk
[2:21:44] <+D2_Synua> confetti melts this boss
[2:21:48] <Dragon_Batman> Or at least it's recovering quickly, now he is getting somewhere
[2:21:49] <AlasterAngelo> guy's got a girly laugh don't make fun of him
[2:21:51] <deviljhojho94> yeah im pretty sure that's a hefty gal
[2:21:51] <fairore> those are monk clothes
[2:21:57] <OrochiSheewa> naginata were usually wielded by women
[2:22:03] <+Kangumosa> Can wamen even be monks?
[2:22:06] <%StEmlosWater> @nukle0nik I think that its hair?
[2:22:06] <deviljhojho94> That's a BATTLE NUN
[2:22:07] <arfsm95> @AngriestPat can you poison him with that prosthetic?
[2:22:08] <nukle0nik> they can be nuns
[2:22:09] <Shishi1205> I mean the laugh is for sure feminine
[2:22:09] <%C0baltCrusade> you have 5 confetti pat
[2:22:10] <graemecrackers1> this next attack is about shooting blood out of your cock
[2:22:13] <%kenpachi9211> DEATH COUNT 139
[2:22:15] <%ThDark> Almost exclusively by women
[2:22:17] <complicatedclarity> cut that ghost open to get to it's cream ectoplasm center zoneRage
[2:22:18] <mrgrimsmiles> ya there called nuns
[2:22:19] <%Nobrev> najinata
[2:22:20] <primarch_lupercal> corruptex by a female oni.
[2:22:22] <deviljhojho94> yeah feminine boys use them all the itime
[2:22:24] <+AXL808> poison a ghost?
[2:22:25] <%C0baltCrusade> use your confetti
[2:22:28] <+Kangumosa> Wouldn't it be corrupted nun then? shieeet
[2:22:29] <+PrimordialDonut> The best strategy for me was to just get her health down instead of doing the posture meter
[2:22:29] <adamparker_cig> how do you poison a ghost
[2:22:34] <nukle0nik> they used to be used by men, but then swords got more popular so the naginatas got relegated to being in the home
[2:22:37] <PowerfulBlackGangs> Ghost spiders
[2:22:38] <Dragon_Batman> Yea after a while it seemed to recover slower
[2:22:39] <Ravenian96> He doesn't seem to do anything too crazy....yet.
[2:22:40] <jerobees> tfw Pat can't pronounce Japanese for shit
[2:22:40] <Tucker0603> @angriestpat why do you think Nobushi is the way she is in For Honor?
[2:22:41] <nukle0nik> so women would use them to defend the house when the man was out
[2:22:49] <Morsuzado> ^
[2:22:49] <AlasterAngelo> Is there a Sweet Surrender arm in this game
[2:22:49] <%StEmlosWater> CUZ HES A GHOST H
[2:22:56] <theoneaoshima> :D
[2:22:56] <arfsm95> @AngriestPat naginatas were usually weilded by onna bugeisha, chicks who stayed home and defended it
[2:22:58] <+D2_Synua> wrong
[2:22:58] <deviljhojho94> ghosts arent real
[2:22:58] <Videogamer4> confetti doesn't matter I can confirm
[2:23:00] <deviljhojho94> just ignore her
[2:23:01] <%C0baltCrusade> its a ghost, ghosts take 80% reduced damage without it not 0
[2:23:05] <$Ralfclogs> It's a wymin
[2:23:09] <+Kangumosa> Need Luigi's vacuum
[2:23:12] <Videogamer4> this boss doesn't inflict terror
[2:23:17] <%ThDark> Maybe use the red candy to do extra posture damage?
[2:23:19] <$SGrim> @C0baltCrusade true
[2:23:21] <Shishi1205> He? HotPokket
[2:23:23] <Dragon_Batman> So it's the curse thing in DS1, kool
[2:23:25] <%StEmlosWater> apatCrazyhand apatCrazyhead apatCrazy
[2:23:26] <%Remery_> Thicc Nobushi :)
[2:23:32] <deviljhojho94> christ alive
[2:23:33] <$valriot> Naginata got kind of outclassed, so they were just left at people homes, so women would use them to defend themselves during THE TROUBLES
[2:23:37] <+ahegotrigger> looks like youre fighting the ghost of guan yu
[2:23:39] <mrgrimsmiles> maybe fire works on him
[2:23:39] <+netrac> Seems more like illusion than ghost
[2:23:50] <Tucker0603> lady raider best girl
[2:23:52] <deviljhojho94> Interesing that womenfolk can also grow massive in the sekiro universe, so far we have only seen guys
[2:23:53] <+D2_Synua> confetti is definitely the way to go
[2:23:57] <Shishi1205> Compared to glaives what is the difference?
[2:24:03] <+Ondartyr> Might really be an extra huge Nagamaki, the handle is too short and the blade too long for a naginata.
[2:24:03] <Hellarussian> this boss is an absolute unit
[2:24:05] <%Reizie_Etherealm> Looks like she's got horns? Hanya maybe?
[2:24:08] <dukenux> you know
[2:24:09] <Shishi1205> Because the chinese really loved those glaives
[2:24:10] <%kenpachi9211> DEATH COUNT 140
[2:24:11] <nukle0nik> i guess pat knows better than everyone telling him to use confetti
[2:24:12] <deviljhojho94> that's a mask i think
[2:24:14] <AlasterAngelo> hey guys is Nobunaga a good guy or a bad guy
[2:24:19] <nukle0nik> both
[2:24:19] <+netrac> ghost have the black stuff
[2:24:20] <Ravenian96> Can't poison ghosts LUL
[2:24:21] <deviljhojho94> nobunaga is like satan
[2:24:23] <dukenux> i can see why peopel are complaining that this is harder than DS Kappa
[2:24:25] <+burgersama_dlx> ghost types aren't weak to poison
[2:24:26] <Morsuzado> this one almost seems like a nagamaki
[2:24:26] <%shawntk_> @AlasterAngelo Yes
[2:24:30] <arfsm95> @AngriestPat also try to use the umbrella more, it seens more reliable and you don't as much posture
[2:24:31] <nukle0nik> nobunaga is like winston churchill
[2:24:33] <%kenpachi9211> DEATH COUNT 141
[2:24:35] <Valentinius_Anodyne> @AlasterAngelo Depends on your point of view
[2:24:37] <deviljhojho94> yeah actually
[2:24:37] <$HentaiSenpai9K> Mortis
[2:24:37] <%Salvation122> Poison attack is doing literally zero damage
[2:24:40] <Shishi1205> He was called the demon of whatever realm so yeah
[2:24:41] <MarylandJutsu> @dukenux its more just PUNISHING
[2:24:41] <Shishi1205> bad dude
[2:24:42] <%connos_livereview> 死
[2:24:42] <OrochiSheewa> oh yeah, they tiny horns there
[2:24:47] <srkAres> poison doesnt work but firecrackers are effective
[2:24:47] <%ScreamingMeat> Guandao is what a Chinese Glaive is called
[2:24:49] <jerobees> You need to inject special ghost venom into the ghost's ghost blood
[2:24:50] <+Kangumosa> DON'T CROSS THE BEAMS
[2:24:53] <AlasterAngelo> okay well none of that helped
[2:24:54] <$valriot> Thats why Hisako uses one in KI, cos her story is she died defending her home using her dads old naginata
[2:24:55] <graemecrackers1> crack open a Red Bull already
[2:24:56] <mrgrimsmiles> fire his ass
[2:24:56] <+PrimordialDonut> Wait for an opening, do 2 hits, back away, treat it like a souls boss and focus on health
[2:24:57] <Parapattern> Fire?
[2:25:01] <jacksawjack> It's the Dancer of the Boreal Valley's Teacher.
[2:25:04] <$SGrim> @valriot also poorer land holder with need of female retainers due to lack of trained warriors gave then Naginata both because they were fairly common and cheap, but they also helped negate the reach disadvantage most women had by being the small of the two sexes in most cases.
[2:25:04] <nukle0nik> nobunaga was called a demon because he used christianity and firearms which his enemies thought was foul
[2:25:06] <%ThDark> @srkAres I'm surprised that the firecrackers pretty much work on everything
[2:25:16] <%StEmlosWater> Pat, you can damage ghosts w/out confetti, confetti do MORE damage. it is not a transiet curse
[2:25:17] <%kenpachi9211> POSION GHOST pat iq 200
[2:25:30] <Shishi1205> I mean, its a fair attempt
[2:25:34] <ukokira> What the fuck why does ghost dude never pop on the bridge
[2:25:35] <GoldeNOVA> That fire thing works on him?
[2:25:43] <$HentaiSenpai9K> Oh its a lady monk
[2:25:45] <$cureneckbeard> zombie goast!
[2:25:46] <%ScreamingMeat> I thought you fought this guy on a bridge?
[2:25:46] <OrochiSheewa> @AngriestPat use your fance new infinite candy
[2:25:52] <jacksawjack> The Codex Astartes says to kill that with fire.
[2:25:53] <srkAres> @ThDark not as effectively on everything though or sometimes enemies just decide they are immune to it
[2:25:55] <deviljhojho94> this is merely a ghost
[2:25:57] <+netrac> the snappy stuff works
[2:26:05] <deviljhojho94> or an ilussion or something
[2:26:13] <GoldeNOVA> You can kick the ghost, you should be able to poison it
[2:26:21] <+Zereaux> it is in fact an nanbokucho era naginata
[2:26:23] <$valriot> Man their posture damage just drops immediately
[2:26:25] <Ravenian96> He can still beat him without confetti so I wouldn't worry about it, Pat getting gud.
[2:26:26] <jerobees> Guys, what if it's the ghost of an illusion?
[2:26:26] <deviljhojho94> No posture damage at all damn
[2:26:28] <%ThDark> @srkAres True, but I assumed it would be ONLY for beasts/animals, but it works on mid-bosses and most enemies
[2:26:40] <deviljhojho94> an apparition
[2:26:42] <reonome> fuck it, they're non binary
[2:26:53] <+Kangumosa> 30% is best to go for posture deatblow
[2:26:54] <$HentaiSenpai9K> LUL
[2:26:58] <deviljhojho94> Look at that posture go
[2:27:00] <deviljhojho94> no way
[2:27:09] <graemecrackers1> so skill
[2:27:14] <$megamonmon123> can you burn ghosts?
[2:27:16] <GoldeNOVA> This is not a posture fight, this is a health damage fight
[2:27:17] <LeeOhX> What is this is a illusion of a ghost
[2:27:21] <Saltmeisterr> is pat in a boss rush atm?
[2:27:24] <graemecrackers1> yo the sword ply is krazy
[2:27:26] <theshillman> getting some serious nioh vibes
[2:27:28] <Shishi1205> She's fucking strong that's for sure
[2:27:30] <Parapattern> Man, that posture is going nowhere
[2:27:34] <%Reizie_Etherealm> Anyone here play Total War Shogun? What's the Naginata good against?
[2:27:35] <complicatedclarity> you've got this pat, punch her ghost nuts
[2:27:40] <+Kangumosa> Pat's actually good at this gaem
[2:27:47] <jerobees> The ghost of an illusion of a ghost
[2:27:51] <srkAres> @ThDark yeah, they seem to be more of an allrounder ability but not particularly amazing against most things
[2:27:54] <deviljhojho94> closer pogChamp
[2:27:57] <freddystonejr> Pat's finally getting gud
[2:27:57] <$valriot> It is a posture fight but Pats keeps backing down so its going dow
[2:28:01] <Staplecrab> sekiro is the dark souls of dark souls games

[2:29:49] <etalmeta> confetti
[2:29:50] <%ScreamingMeat> I dunno about using the super shield that makes me invulnerable
[2:29:51] <LeeOhX> and that was our best run bois
[2:29:52] <arfsm95> @AngriestPat maybe in like, when she spins the naginata like that just leave it open, you don't take damage at all
[2:29:54] <Valentinius_Anodyne> Seems like there has to be a better way, but I don't know
[2:29:54] <complicatedclarity> It's alright pat you can do it zoneLove
[2:29:58] <+Kangumosa> gtfo with the confetti shit, this aint a wedding

[2:30:18] <GoldeNOVA> Mist Raven could be good too?
[2:30:20] <dukenux> You brought her down to 50% health, that means you only need to be twice as good now

[2:30:47] <%Reizie_Etherealm> I REALIZE
[2:30:48] <@Moobot> I've been playing this game for how long? Oh only 2h 30m.
[2:30:48] <Dragon_Batman> You better off with the shield
[2:30:49] <+hoenhime344> sorry
[2:30:52] <LeeOhX> That did fckin nothing
[2:30:52] <%ScreamingMeat> It's a Naginata
[2:30:52] <%StEmlosWater> JUST TRY THE CONFETTI
[2:30:54] <+Smug_Skylar> confetti
[2:30:55] <+Kangumosa> god damn it 3 blasts of fire burns bosses
[2:30:55] <deviljhojho94> YOU WERE JUST LIKE ME
[2:30:56] <nukle0nik> pat refusing to even try the confetti lol
[2:30:58] <+chronopaladin> just do the thing
[2:31:00] <+AXL808> The trick is to get good
[2:31:07] <$HentaiSenpai9K> Its a stick with a blade at the end
[2:31:08] <Shishi1205> oil + fire if you have spare oil? @AngriestPat
[2:31:12] <Staplecrab> don't waste confetti on this fight lol
[2:31:12] <crossbowranger> Sacrifice your pots for extra spirits Kappa
[2:31:15] <Staplecrab> it's a limited resource
[2:31:18] <$HentaiSenpai9K> Do it Pat
[2:31:22] <$HentaiSenpai9K> Just do it
[2:31:25] <%tweedler92> it's a consumable of course Pat is refusing to use it
[2:31:28] <%Rakenshin> Confetti is limited...not worth using it unless he has this fight down
[2:31:28] <$HentaiSenpai9K> But do it tho
[2:31:30] <AlasterAngelo> spears > swords
[2:31:34] <$valriot> Man i hope Nioh adds Naginata, lemme do a Hisako build
[2:31:34] <AlasterAngelo> historically i am right
[2:31:35] <yourboiatreus> ￼
[2:31:37] <%Reizie_Etherealm> Don't let your dreams be dreams!
[2:31:38] <%ThDark> @Staplecrab You can buy confetti though, if I recall
[2:31:39] <+Kangumosa> Pat the hoarder refusing to use consumables as usual
[2:31:41] <MarylandJutsu> Sacrifice Umbrella for more time on the clcock
[2:31:42] <OrochiSheewa> but what if he needs it later NotLikeThis
[2:31:52] <$valriot> Nioh 2 specifically i mean
[2:31:56] <GoldeNOVA> If a boss fight requires a limited resource to beat, then it's not a very good boss fight
[2:31:57] <%StEmlosWater> @Rakenshin He got it down to fift percent, he might have won if confetti popped
[2:32:00] <@Moobot> Whoa I don't even shout that much! (@Kangumosa) (warning)
[2:32:01] <+hoenhime344> but if he needs it now
[2:32:02] <+chronopaladin> shialabeouf dotjpeg
[2:32:05] <jerobees> But I only have 87 of them!
[2:32:06] <Shishi1205> Don't you have essentially free candy? @AngriestPat
[2:32:07] <%HRDSalami654> But what if he needs them later!
[2:32:12] <DrSpatula> You were doing it but then you started letting yourself get hit again. Stop getting hit
[2:32:16] <+matrixManipulator> how would confetti help? thought it was a Seciro brand Transient Curse from DS1
[2:32:22] <AlasterAngelo> This ninja went to Japan to sing Abba in a cold river
[2:32:23] <%Rakenshin> @Jpdodds True, but I think he needs more practice
[2:32:24] <+seriousink> oh hey, pat made it to the dark souls boss
[2:32:25] <+matrixManipulator> *Sekiro
[2:32:26] <%connos_livereview> this corrupted mongk motherfucker thinks they are pretty slick but i bet theyve never had the succ
[2:32:36] <arfsm95> @AngriestPat the naginata spins destroy your posture, maybe as a test, try to leave the umbrella open, just to see
[2:32:39] <%ScreamingMeat> @AlasterAngelo Well is is a historical fact that Samurai used spears as their primary weapon and the Katana was mostly used as a back up weapon. Japan just loves to glorify it for some reason
[2:32:41] <$SGrim> @AlasterAngelo except in cases on needing to defend the interior of castle passage ways. Specifically stair wells.
[2:32:42] <%kenpachi9211> DEATH COUNT 144
[2:32:49] <LeeOhX> Got too greedy boi
[2:32:54] <Dragon_Batman> If the confetti allows you to hit a foe, than it's useless, he is already hitting the boss
[2:32:56] <%StEmlosWater> @matrixManipulator You can damage ghosts without confetti, confetti is just a buff vs ghosts. It isnt a transient curse
[2:33:04] <$SGrim> @ScreamingMeat SPEAR NOT FOLDED OVER 10000 TIMES SwiftRage
[2:33:05] <OrochiSheewa> but what if he needs the infinite candy later NotLikeThis
[2:33:13] <%Salvation122> This feels like "you must be this tall to ride" and you're not there yet. Attacks are barely tickling, and the posture meter isn't filling
[2:33:13] <Valentinius_Anodyne> Spears are more stylish than swords anyways
[2:33:16] <+hoenhime344> greed is the name of this game. if you dont attemp to parry every attack you are not learning
[2:33:17] <+Ondartyr> The blade is at least as long as the hilt, this does not look like a naginata.
[2:33:18] <dukenux> Because swords are also symbols of regal power
[2:33:19] <$NocturneNovember> @kenpachi9211 That's gonna be DSP's death count by the time he leaves the first area. Dude's stuck on it LUL
[2:33:21] <+Zereaux> can he upgrade his weapons?
[2:33:24] <%connos_livereview> katana is the japanese word for nothing personnel kid
[2:33:29] <arfsm95> @ScreamingMeat i think japan glorifies katanas because they are a japanese creation, unlike spears and such
[2:33:31] <+Kangumosa> the arm you can upgrade
[2:33:46] <$valriot> @salvation122 I dont think Pats tall enough for any ridw
[2:33:54] <%Salvation122> @valriot Fair
[2:33:58] <FiftyFiveP> samurai were the only ones allowed to carry swords so they get associated with samurai
[2:34:01] <+hoenhime344> lmao
[2:34:03] <arfsm95> @AngriestPat the naginata spins destroy your posture, maybe as a test, try to leave the umbrella open, just to see
[2:34:05] <Aussie_Manny> BigPhish
[2:34:07] <%kenpachi9211> DEATH COUNT 145
[2:34:08] <Shishi1205> Oh so she was actually in the demo @AngriestPat And she is weak to divine confeti (Wikia coming tru) Also definitelly a priestess
[2:34:09] <$valriot> Only the Teacups for Patrick
[2:34:09] <%connos_livereview> 死
[2:34:16] <Shishi1205> Read @AngriestPat
[2:34:18] <+D2_Synua> firecracker and confetti pls
[2:34:19] <+Zereaux> break pat take a break
[2:34:19] <%StEmlosWater> You can damage ghosts without confetti, confetti is just a buff vs ghosts. It isnt a transient curse
[2:34:19] <$cureneckbeard> 死
[2:34:20] <+hoenhime344> the spins are parryable
[2:34:20] <$megamonmon123> i call that progress
[2:34:21] <+matrixManipulator> @Jpdodds So the confetti being saved for ghost minibosses is because it's rare and those are just hard enemies
[2:34:28] <%sabertoothzombie> just use the shuriken
[2:34:29] <dukenux> and yeah, katanas were a weapon of aristocracy, so they have that elitist bend to them
[2:34:30] <arfsm95> @AngriestPat you are doing weel on the offensive end, but the defensive is the problem, you need to be able to take more hits
[2:34:31] <Ravenian96> Zoinks scoob there's a 10 foot tall chick with a naginata laughing in the courtyard
[2:34:33] <+timbob> The pitter patter running is so strange to me
[2:34:34] <sam_drucker> Hi everyone
[2:34:41] <$shadow1man9> @AngriestPat Apparently Firecrackers work here
[2:34:42] <%ScreamingMeat> @SGrim They HAD to fold the steel like that because the iron in their country is shitty
[2:34:42] <deviljhojho94> Hello
[2:34:42] <%kenpachi9211> Up UP the count goes where it will stop fuck it
[2:34:42] <Shishi1205> Oh so she was actually in the demo @AngriestPat And she is weak to divine confeti (Wikia coming tru) Also definitelly a priestess
[2:34:43] <dukenux> spears were he weapons of commoners
[2:34:45] <+seriousink> @AngriestPat this is just a souls boss, fight it like one and you should be fine
[2:34:46] <%StEmlosWater> @matrixManipulator yeah
[2:34:52] <+netrac> you can use the anti illusion to stun her
[2:34:56] <+TheIntellectional> just dont get hit Kappa
[2:34:57] <%StEmlosWater> @matrixManipulator pat THINKS its a transiet curse
[2:34:57] <Aussie_Manny> ???
[2:34:59] <%connos_livereview> read the angriest pat manga before the anime please
[2:35:00] <%Spydurman> @AngriestPat have you tried getting good?
[2:35:02] <KenzBurp> just git gud pat Kappa
[2:35:08] <$valriot> Just dont get hit, dig up stupid
[2:35:08] <Aussie_Manny> HE HATES IT
[2:35:10] <Dehlome> he big hates it
[2:35:11] <%C0baltCrusade> sekiro streams are
[2:35:11] <+hoenhime344> fire crackers only work once on a boos per hp bar i believe
[2:35:12] <$HentaiSenpai9K> Ghost hate light
[2:35:12] <@Moobot> Whoa I don't even shout that much! (@Jpdodds) (warning)
[2:35:16] <%C0baltCrusade> apatBig 1
[2:35:19] <+matrixManipulator> @Jpdodds thanks for the info, this makes more sense now
[2:35:22] <OrochiSheewa> pro tip don't die Kappa
[2:35:22] <silverira> @AngriestPat have you tried poison?
[2:35:27] <SummonerMagno> are firecrackers a temporary buff???
[2:35:29] <Ravenian96> Me HATE fireworks raaghg
[2:35:29] <stabbityrabbit> ALRIGHT PAT. All you gotta do in not get hit, and win. Pretty easy really...
[2:35:30] <%connos_livereview> reed the mango
[2:35:35] <+SomeOtherNeb> women are famously weak to fireworks!
[2:35:39] <+Ondartyr> Well, it makes sense that firecrackers are strong against ghosts
[2:35:39] <+SpectrumSpy> Poison didn't work
[2:35:40] <+8framelag> super effect
[2:35:40] <%galaxyswirl> dont you know, ghost ladies hate loud noises
[2:35:40] <$HentaiSenpai9K> Now just do it
[2:35:42] <jerobees> No, they're a temporary debuff
[2:35:49] <+AXL808> Discover the secret to winning, Ghosts HATE it
[2:35:50] <GoldeNOVA> Can you interrupt her attacks with it?
[2:35:53] <+Zereaux> did that fucker really point at sekiro man
[2:36:00] <nukle0nik> so with the amount of fireworks he has he can maybe get 40% of the boss's health
[2:36:02] <%ThDark> You can probably get one weapon art/charged attack in on the stun, like the Ashina overheard strike
[2:36:05] <dukenux> remember Pat, if you're loosing, CHEAT
[2:36:07] <nukle0nik> but the remaining 60 is still a problem
[2:36:12] <crossbowranger> Can't pat just sacrifice 3 health jugs for a +15 on spirits or does it only go up to +5 for the first time?
[2:36:12] <pigeontactician> i mean, if somebody threw firecrackers at me i'd probably flinch too
[2:36:13] <dukenux> you thaught me that Kappa
[2:36:16] <+chronopaladin> well butter my biscuit
[2:36:18] <Ravenian96> Damn kids with their bottle rockets!!! You're gonna blast my fingers off!!!
[2:36:26] <$valriot> Im so confused by Pats mentality here. "ill do posture damage, then immediately walk away and let them regain posture"
[2:36:27] <dukenux> Well butter me and call me Sandy
[2:36:31] <%connos_livereview> you truly are the greatest shinobi of us all sekiro shadows die twice
[2:36:31] <%Rakenshin> It would be like Pat to just start throwing shit at people in the middle of a swordfight LuL
[2:36:40] <%Ion_Laser> get off my lawn with those firecrackers you damn kids!
[2:36:49] <+AXL808> get good time
[2:36:53] <Aussie_Manny> NOT YET, WOLF!
[2:36:55] <MarylandJutsu> KICK HER ASS PAT
[2:36:55] <dukenux> POCKET SAND
[2:36:56] <TakesGuts> how can a ghost be afraid of fireworks?
[2:36:56] <etalmeta> @valriot he's doing health damage so that the boss doesn't regen posture as fast
[2:36:58] <Aussie_Manny> IT'S NOT OVER YET!
[2:36:58] <+burgersama_dlx> Someone mod the firecrackers to be a fake mouse
[2:36:59] <jerobees> @Rakenshin end them rightly
[2:37:01] <dukenux> chichah
[2:37:03] <Parapattern> Would the handful of ashes help here, maybe?
[2:37:07] <BestBrosPlay123> Still need to beat Bloodborne!
[2:37:08] <T_sarr> whats the death count?
[2:37:17] <%sabertoothzombie> Pat's doing a shit ton better than other streamers I've seen in this fight
[2:37:19] <dukenux> 140something
[2:37:23] <%Reizie_Etherealm> Those dodges tho
[2:37:31] <complicatedclarity> show her the power of pocket sand
[2:37:34] <$HentaiSenpai9K> @sabertoothzombie Thats because hes huge
[2:37:35] <%Fadedblank247> you got this Pat
[2:37:37] <MarylandJutsu> @sabertoothzombie cause the power of Elmo prottects him
[2:37:38] <T_sarr> damn
[2:37:48] <dukenux> i need to see how's Charlie doing, he's been blasting through earlier levels
[2:37:51] <%Reizie_Etherealm> Throw sand into her face
[2:37:57] <%connos_livereview> sekiro : parry or die alot more than twice
[2:38:03] <Arth__> run away from him and when he does the leap jump dodge and hit him a few times > repeat? or is that tp cheesy and ruining the fight
[2:38:07] <blackbookalpha> Pat find the true ninja way: sword stab footises
[2:38:08] <Aussie_Manny> DORYAA!
[2:38:11] <%kenpachi9211> DEATH COUNT 146
[2:38:15] <mrgrimsmiles> crazy talk been acitved!
[2:38:16] <dukenux> its okay
[2:38:18] <LeeOhX> oof Pat boi
[2:38:21] <%King_Krimzon> Why did you?
[2:38:23] <nukle0nik> 45% health left of the boss and no gourd, pat's fucked
[2:38:25] <+matrixManipulator> @valriot Also it looks to me like the boss wins posture fight by virtue of bigger bar and more posture damage with those big chain moves, making this a health whittleing battle
[2:38:29] <Shishi1205> She was actually in the demo @AngriestPat And she is weak to divine confeti (Wikia coming tru) Also definitelly a priestess
[2:38:29] <arfsm95> @AngriestPat firecrackers as offensive, and umbrella as defensive seens to be the way
[2:38:31] <blackbookalpha> seeing Shirrako beat the final boss with just footsies was MWAH
[2:38:32] <+AXL808> what's the explanation for people being so big like this?
[2:38:34] <Aussie_Manny> BigPhish
[2:38:36] <%kenpachi9211> DEATH COUNT 147
[2:38:36] <$HentaiSenpai9K> Ok THAT was cheap
[2:38:42] <crossbowranger> BigPhish
[2:38:45] <+burgersama_dlx> @AXL808 working out super hard
[2:38:45] <%connos_livereview> oh my gourd
[2:38:47] <T_sarr> whats the drawback of self-res?
[2:38:48] <$megamonmon123> 3 more til 16
[2:38:50] <FiftyFiveP> they got a lot of money in life
[2:38:52] <DrSpatula> Stop doing the bad things
[2:38:53] <$megamonmon123> 3 more till 50
[2:38:55] <%C0baltCrusade> confetti is NOT A TRANSIENT CURSE
[2:39:00] <KenzBurp> the spite

[2:39:00] <%C0baltCrusade> apatBig 1
[2:39:02] <OrochiSheewa> LUL
[2:39:02] <Staplecrab> Pat don't waste divine confetti on her, use it on the headless
[2:39:02] <+vinivss> @axl808 they have more spiritual energy
[2:39:03] <%ScreamingMeat> Ghost hate confetti
[2:39:05] <+matrixManipulator> lets see how this works
[2:39:05] <%El_Desperad0> It's a lie Pat
[2:39:06] <boostergoldz> So far for me it's been purple = confetti buff is effective.
[2:39:07] <Aussie_Manny> @kenpachi9211 Does the false death count too? 🤔
[2:39:08] <adamparker_cig> crazy talk ready to activate
[2:39:09] <deviljhojho94> My ninja way is watching other people play hard games
[2:39:10] <TakesGuts> don't waste confetti in this boss

[2:42:58] <+netrac> more like up to half
[2:42:59] <Aussie_Manny> Don't miss, boiiii.
[2:42:59] <$SGrim> Solid 10%
[2:43:01] <Shishi1205> Using 3 different items lmao
[2:43:02] <complicatedclarity> now you just need a million more
[2:43:03] <%Rakenshin> Huh
[2:43:05] <Aussie_Manny> IT WORKS!
[2:43:05] <+Rewrench> seemed to stun so could use for that
[2:43:05] <%Gogogolem> does that work on the river woman too?
[2:43:06] <%ThDark> That's a good chunk, damn
[2:43:06] <%Reizie_Etherealm> CHEESE TECH
[2:43:07] <+8framelag> super effective
[2:43:10] <+hoenhime344> welp...paint that hoe with our seed!
[2:43:10] <BokuNoTyler> go for the posture kill no hp kill
[2:43:10] <%ScreamingMeat> She hates load noises
[2:43:10] <+Kangumosa> that snap tho
[2:43:11] <reonome> @anime_boyz do you know what half is
[2:43:12] <MagknO> probably can only pop 5 of them before he's immune
[2:43:12] <deviljhojho94> LET'S StinkyCheese IT
[2:43:14] <Aussie_Manny> IT AIN'T EAST
[2:43:16] <%VanaSkiller> thanos snap her out of existence
[2:43:18] <Aussie_Manny> EASY*
[2:43:19] <blackbookalpha> CHEESE TECH encouraged in this game
[2:43:20] <FiftyFiveP> TRIVIALIZED
[2:43:20] <stabbityrabbit> So this is just: Quit That Hoarding Bitch, The Fight.
[2:43:21] <Shishi1205> Easy mode activated
[2:43:21] <Aussie_Manny> BEIN' CHEESEY!
[2:43:22] <Valentinius_Anodyne> If it works, it works
[2:43:24] <%Ion_Laser> StinkyCheese StinkyCheese StinkyCheese
[2:43:30] <+xelshion> pro tip: deflect everything that isnt red
[2:43:31] <Tucker0603> over use
[2:43:32] <GoldeNOVA> NO HONOR
[2:43:33] <%ThDark> Oh, does it only work DOWN to half?
[2:43:33] <deviljhojho94> StinkyCheese StinkyCheese StinkyCheese
[2:43:33] <jerobees> Oh that kind of half
[2:43:34] <Aussie_Manny> Right, it has a threshold.
[2:43:34] <%patman22897> CHEESE TACTICS
[2:43:35] <TwinBat> can only cheese so much
[2:43:37] <T_sarr> thats what he meant
[2:43:38] <nukle0nik> you get 3 i guess
[2:43:39] <%ScreamingMeat> Now use confetti and firecrackers
[2:43:39] <+matrixManipulator> stops working at half?
[2:43:40] <Dragon_Batman> Oooh so you can only use it till half health
[2:43:43] <Shishi1205> Maybe he was saying it only was until half
[2:43:43] <+netrac> deploy all bs strategies
[2:43:44] <MForan98> ooooh "works till half"
[2:43:44] <+AXL808> He did say they would damage to half
[2:43:45] <%connos_livereview> ninjas were known to use a fuckton of items i suppose
[2:43:45] <%Nobrev> that's what they meant by "to half health"
[2:43:51] <blackbookalpha> you're not samurai, you're shinobi. Code of Shinobi is CHEESE!
[2:43:55] <MForan98> not "drops to half" I see
[2:43:55] <%Reizie_Etherealm> Looks like they build up resistance with each use like flash to Elder Dragons in MonHun
[2:43:58] <$valriot> Watch as Pat realises glowing purple lady might not be a real person
[2:44:01] <arfsm95> @AngriestPat it damages till half, no TO half
[2:44:02] <crossbowranger> CHEESE
[2:44:04] <complicatedclarity> s zoneMash that ghost
[2:44:04] <+8framelag> instantly lowered difficulty
[2:44:05] <graemecrackers1> woooo
[2:44:09] <T_sarr> define real
[2:44:11] <Shishi1205> Man the Cheese life is the best life
[2:44:11] <+eminencerain> looks like its all got diminishing returns
[2:44:15] <Valentinius_Anodyne> Shinobi love the stinky cheese
[2:44:16] <%ScreamingMeat> Maybe use the firecracker a little more sparingly
[2:44:18] <kiryuva> oof, that range!
[2:44:19] <crossbowranger> He only gets one chance tho
[2:44:20] <OrochiSheewa> ghost are apparently weak to a lot of thing huh LUL
[2:44:24] <deviljhojho94> Fuck you miyazaki! StinkyCheese
[2:44:28] <%HRDSalami654> I think it just won't interupt an attack animation.
[2:44:33] <blackbookalpha> true victory achieved through the greatest of cheese
[2:44:33] <%Reizie_Etherealm> You can do it Pat!!
[2:44:43] <Dragon_Batman> Maybe that's why she only has one health pip
[2:44:52] <%connos_livereview> that hitbox tho
[2:44:55] <+Kangumosa> the confetti does nothing
[2:44:55] <Ravenian96> Miyazaki making you get items to fight bosses effectively. Absolutely wicked madman LUL
[2:44:58] <GoldeNOVA> Bustin' bustin' bustin'

[2:45:35] <+Kangumosa> Pat Parry game is strong
[2:45:35] <T_sarr> man this healthbar seems so puny compared to Midir and the like
[2:45:38] <+8framelag> posture kill now unlocked
[2:45:39] <Dragon_Batman> By this time you can get the posture done ine
[2:45:42] <Shishi1205> It seems like it goes down very slowly now
[2:45:46] <%Rakenshin> You got this, Pat
[2:45:50] <Valentinius_Anodyne> Huh, did the snap seeds make them stop reducing poise?
[2:45:51] <Aussie_Manny> @graemecrackers1 Possibly. He's getting better with each fight.
[2:45:57] <blackbookalpha> Shirrako couldn't beat the final boss with parries, just did tiny back stabs and running in circles

[3:09:10] <gustavozxd> is Pat ok with dragon rotting everyone by reviving all the time?
[3:09:11] <arfsm95> @AngriestPat but his posture was red wasnt it?
[3:09:11] <OrochiSheewa> @PRchris13 skill from defeating a certain boss
[3:09:16] <+Das_Prints> The fire works for the stub mainly. The damage over time is just a bonus.
[3:09:17] <%eyelessstrider> what happened to using the oil?
[3:09:18] <FeedbacK7777> Fire is only for stun @AngriestPat

[3:14:49] <mayorrev> P O C K E T S A N D
[3:14:51] <complicatedclarity> pocket sand is the way of the ancient coward lords
[3:14:51] <Ravenian96> shh shhhh SHAH

[3:14:54] <%connos_livereview> ACHAA
[3:14:54] <%Reizie_Etherealm> That's not very good
[3:14:55] <arfsm95> now pat can use fire
[3:14:58] <nukle0nik> it's ash, it's really hard to throw
[3:15:12] <battlefield900> his sharingan is fully awaken
[3:15:16] <blackbookalpha> Naruto has ruined the 'true' shinobi way: cheese and deception
[3:15:18] <+hoenhime344> have you ever thown a fist full of ash?? your not gonna get more than 2 feet
[3:15:20] <Shishi1205> That's a bitch bar scaled if I've ever seen one
[3:15:22] <blackbookalpha> and cowardice
[3:15:22] <nukle0nik> this guy has a million p
[3:15:24] <+Kangumosa> Man that eye blur effect is glorious
[3:15:25] <zombric> Have you tried throwing ash? It's not very aerodynamic.
[3:15:45] <%Reizie_Etherealm> "I won't scatter your consumables to the heartless demon"
[3:15:45] <%ScreamingMeat> I used to think Dark Souls and Bloodborne could get your blood pumping...then I played Sekiro
[3:15:48] <Ravenian96> He's beginning TO BELIEVE!
[3:15:55] <MoulesFritz> have you tried NOT just standing there and letting him wail on you?
[3:15:58] <+Kangumosa> I like how enemies can zerg you to infinity, but as soon as you get parried, nah son GG
[3:16:01] <battlefield900> DONT LOOK AT HIS EYES
[3:16:03] <MoulesFritz> you can't tank him
[3:16:04] <QuaiRolDor> with that kind of throw, its showing that its not just ash that he is throwing
[3:16:10] <+Chopper3k> I freaking love this combat
[3:16:12] <Shishi1205> WOW
[3:16:21] <$HentaiSenpai9K> Do it Pat
[3:16:21] <arfsm95> @AngriestPat maybe poison?
[3:16:22] <Wonky_Woop> he's like a boss, huh. Until you know his gimmek that is
[3:16:27] <%Remery_> But isn't it adoarable?
[3:16:35] <%Reizie_Etherealm> You have to fight this guy blindfolded so he can't use his sharingan
[3:16:35] <%ScreamingMeat> Jump off dude when you jump over their sweeps
[3:16:52] <nukle0nik> use your ninja tools dog

[3:17:12] <@Moobot> I've been playing this game for how long? Oh only 3h 17m.
[3:17:13] <arfsm95> @ScreamingMeat i think he prefers the damage for now because of posture recover
[3:17:15] <Shishi1205> I have no info on this dude, extralife doesn't know what part of the quest this is. It didn't even say dojun could be an enemy

[3:17:18] <SiegeJay> Pat can beat this boss
[3:17:20] <graemecrackers1> NANI?!
[3:17:24] <MoulesFritz> why use ninja tools or parry when you can just stand there and let him wail on you like a training dummy?
[3:17:25] <%StEmlosWater> ! ALERT ! new DMC5 ep is out!
[3:17:25] <SiegeJay> OH Shit That is new
[3:17:32] <%Rakenshin> Pat is a ninja but he fights guys head on like a samurai
[3:17:35] <Shishi1205> Don't you have to dodge into him?
[3:17:37] <nukle0nik> use your firecrackers
[3:17:39] <%Hilleltaco> I thought I already resubbed but I guess it was just a weird streak thing I don't know how Twitch works
[3:17:42] <+Chopper3k> Does he have Mikiri counter?
[3:18:00] <VRNK> is deflect in this game like parry?
[3:18:02] <$Cobra743> kick him off the cliff
[3:18:03] <%JusTTheGuyYouNeed> JusTTheGuyYouNeed subscribed with Twitch Prime. 
[3:18:04] <%ScreamingMeat> @arfsm95 Posture damage is arguably more important than health damage tho
[3:18:07] <MarylandJutsu> @Jpdodds ????
[3:18:08] <+Kangumosa> pat dodging those hits rather than parrying them
[3:18:09] <IminyourBase> YEAH BIG COWARD
[3:18:09] <%Gogogolem> Is he weak to lud noises too?
[3:18:11] <OrochiSheewa> trust counter? yes
[3:18:13] <SiegeJay> @Shishi1205 He can block everything but the sweep and Kick. When the Red Symbol pops up, its unblockable
[3:18:14] <battlefield900> your panicking chill
[3:18:16] <+askalta> pat remember to breath irl
[3:18:17] <%Hilleltaco> Also in my confusion I think I lost my gross eye oh no

[3:18:40] <Fordlotus> This is the true SHINOBI WAY
[3:18:41] <%Rakenshin> Using some kind of water JUTSU
[3:18:42] <+matrixManipulator> This is why I have trouble believing pat is a real coward
[3:18:43] <%Toynota10> The Shinobi's greatest weakness. WATER
[3:18:44] <MoulesFritz> Dodge, dammit
[3:18:46] <OrochiSheewa> guess we live in the water now :)
[3:18:51] <Crimsonaether96> jesus that nervous laughter kills me xD
[3:18:53] <arfsm95> @ScreamingMeat it is, you're right, but if the enemy has high health he recovers posture really quick, so is worth to do damage before posture damage
[3:18:55] <$castcode> woolieMIRIN
[3:18:57] <Shishi1205> that's a thrust right?
[3:19:03] <VRNK> that was a sweep
[3:19:09] <Shishi1205> The migiri counter is failing?
[3:19:16] <+Kangumosa> I swear if pat dodges forward into another unblockable again, im gonna unsub
[3:19:18] <+hoenhime344> why dossent he hit him when he is regaining his posture? does he counterattack?

[3:19:49] <+hoenhime344> he also keeps dashing foward into the kanji
[3:19:54] <battlefield900> atleast we got a strat
[3:19:56] <MoulesFritz> @AngriestPat stop dodging forward into those unblockable sweeps
[3:19:56] <Shishi1205> Yeah, I know, but he uses thrusts too right?
[3:19:57] <%kenpachi9211> OK TIME FOR BREAK
[3:19:58] <%Minovski> mabe ledge hang after aggro?
[3:20:00] <%Seraphile> @AngriestPat shuriken to stop him regaining poise
[3:20:03] <+Kangumosa> It's been a good sub, guys hahaha
[3:20:03] <%Toynota10> How much Dragonrot has Pat spread?
[3:20:06] <%Gogogolem> @AngriestPat Pat where did you get that Ninjutsu thing?
[3:20:07] <cgmerryo> because dodge forward counters the thrust
[3:20:10] <TakesGuts> being a coward isn't rewarded in this game
[3:20:10] <metroidstar> you can counter for both
[3:20:12] <%Fenrirlives> Pat why do let him just get his posture back?
[3:20:15] <OrochiSheewa> that's what you get for betraying his trust and luring into dr. frankensteins lair LUL
[3:20:15] <VRNK> pat big forgetting movesets
[3:20:19] <+ashlee1018> It's okay, Pat, you got this!
[3:20:22] <rjj25> parry thrusts
[3:20:22] <Ravenian96> Pat really wants to Mikiri and the game knows it so it Jebaits him LUL
[3:20:26] <+hoenhime344> but its not? lol hes getting destroyed every time
[3:20:28] <Saltmeisterr> wat about the sword step"
[3:20:39] <+SNDGametimeOnYoutube> Oh god live twitch chat is more cancerous then the Reddit/YouTube backseat comments
[3:20:45] <Shishi1205> Is there counter attack dmg?
[3:20:50] <+Kangumosa> no
[3:20:52] <leole11> look at him melt lmao
[3:20:54] <SiegeJay> Enemy just got Trivialized
[3:21:00] <$SGrim> @SNDGametimeOnYoutube welcome to the internet in real time LUL
[3:21:02] <%JusTTheGuyYouNeed> is this royalguard the game ?
[3:21:06] <Shishi1205> I mean not like Bloodborne I imagine, that was disgusting
[3:21:14] <arfsm95> @Shishi1205 kinda? some enemies deflect counters
[3:21:17] <$HentaiSenpai9K> @sndgametimeonyoutube The difference is we're memeing cuz we know Pat's humor
[3:21:17] <+timbob> Maybe the seed will fuck him up like it did the monk lol
[3:21:19] <nukle0nik> need to do more poise damage
[3:21:22] <%onlypuppet> OWL2019200iq
[3:21:23] <%ScreamingMeat> Ok, so this confuses me. You apparently get 2 Revive tokens. 1 is restored when you rest at an idol and the other is charged from killing enemies. So why can I only revive once when my 2nd token is full? I know you can revive twice because I've done it once before.
[3:21:25] <$SGrim> @JusTTheGuyYouNeed mixed with Trickster for unguardables? Kind of.
[3:21:27] <graemecrackers1> Good ol red eyes is back
[3:21:36] <Shishi1205> I meant like when you get hit after failing an attack
[3:21:41] <%Reizie_Etherealm> I have a feeling this guy would've helped you against the O'Rin lady, with him going on about the shamisen and all, she seems to fit the bill
[3:21:47] <nukle0nik> this might be it
[3:21:48] <+Kangumosa> SuB SaVeD, hE dOdGeD
[3:21:48] <+SNDGametimeOnYoutube> Lol I’m sure you think it’s memes
[3:21:49] <Psyramics> @ScreamingMeat there's a cooldown on revives
[3:21:54] <@JustinianKnight> There is a cooldown after a death
[3:21:54] <+hoenhime344> omg he lumped
[3:21:55] <%JusTTheGuyYouNeed> @SGrim i guess i need this game now
[3:21:56] <graemecrackers1> I like the sound of he swords
[3:21:58] <+hoenhime344> jjumped*
[3:21:59] <metroidstar> do the head stomp
[3:21:59] <Shortnamer> almost there baby
[3:21:59] <Ravenian96> It's so easy dude LUL
[3:22:03] <Shishi1205> If you beat O'rin he drops a jizou
[3:22:08] <arfsm95> @ScreamingMeat because once you revive, the bar is blacked out, you need to execute someone before
[3:22:11] <Shishi1205> That's what the wikia says
[3:22:17] <+hoenhime344> nvm
[3:22:18] <%ScreamingMeat> Oh
[3:22:20] <+hoenhime344> it was a fluke
[3:22:24] <nukle0nik> clang clang clang
[3:22:25] <DrSpatula> He's learning!!!
[3:22:26] <%ScreamingMeat> Thnx chat
[3:22:46] <arfsm95> @ScreamingMeat if pat dies you will see that the "revive tokens" have a black bar in it, that's because it's blocked
[3:22:58] <+Kangumosa> It's blocked until you deathblow
[3:23:02] <VRNK> if the sword glints on the left its a sweep, on the right its a thrust
[3:23:05] <$Gr4ndm4rsh4ll> would fire work against him since he had red eyes?
[3:23:12] <+Kangumosa> yes
[3:23:15] <Shishi1205> At this point you're actually going to kill him
[3:23:15] <+Kangumosa> you missed the fire spam
[3:23:25] <$Gr4ndm4rsh4ll> figured he tried haha
[3:23:26] <graemecrackers1> harder then bloodborne ?
[3:23:28] <Saltmeisterr> that posture regen stuff suchs
[3:23:31] <nukle0nik> pat tried fier and it didn't do jack shit
[3:23:40] <%Reizie_Etherealm> This guy must've been a great swordsman in life, even in death that hasn't changed much
[3:23:42] <arfsm95> @Gr4ndm4rsh4ll it works, but bat prefers the poison from the other prosthetic to do more damage
[3:23:43] <VRNK> okay fuck me i guess
[3:23:44] <+hoenhime344> there we go
[3:23:46] <Shishi1205> Firecrakers did nothing much
[3:23:51] <mudamudajo> do the kick when you jump dodge his sweep
[3:23:54] <$Gr4ndm4rsh4ll> @arfsm95 makes sense
[3:23:57] <+hoenhime344> parry 3 times and jump the sweep. perfect
[3:23:57] <blackjackskellington> I think this is the black samurai pat sacrificed
[3:23:58] <nukle0nik> so close
[3:23:58] <pshuuu> what? i never got a red eye fight. is this at doujins house?
[3:24:00] <%ScreamingMeat> Enemy step for sweeps man, Enemy step
[3:24:04] <+SomeOtherNeb> why won't the black man die

[3:25:18] <Shishi1205> He would haved dropped if you had beat The shamisen lady
[3:25:19] <complicatedclarity> why are you like this autocorrect
[3:25:21] <nukle0nik> dosaku and dojun were the same guy
[3:25:22] <%connos_livereview> RANDY NO

[3:25:27] <Dragon_Batman> Gooood job
[3:25:29] <PRchris13> @AngriestPat i think you should had killed him in the first time ... if you had you would the second guy would had not turned evil
[3:25:30] <arfsm95> @AngriestPat FUCK, LOOK WITHIN, that's bloodborne
[3:25:31] <+Ondartyr> It's eyes on the inside... Of course it is...
[3:25:35] <arfsm95> @AngriestPat the eyes are on the inside
[3:25:36] <london_flexing> He was at the beginning of the game. Bad end for that NPC
[3:25:38] <Doodle_Taco> @connos_livereview Allegedly
[3:25:38] <SiegeJay> JIZZ DEMON!
[3:25:43] <mrgrimsmiles> eyes on the insides refenece there
[3:25:50] <stabbityrabbit> @AngriestPat Remember the umbilical cords from Bloodborne? I wonder if those lumps affect the ending.
[3:25:52] <$Tarcanist_> you run into the big snek again? @angriestpat
[3:26:02] <+Kangumosa> Bad ENding achieved
[3:26:10] <%ArchimerDreatect> i think people are doing big speculate
[3:26:12] <adamparker_cig> lumpy ending
[3:26:14] <VRNK> if you dont send the black guy to the abandoned prison or whatever, i guess
[3:26:16] <%wsintai> Its a FromSoft game; of COURSE theres a convoluted alternate ending
[3:26:17] <+Das_Prints> The samurai you can send here was following the sound of the instrument the ghost woman was using.
[3:26:18] <Shishi1205> No clue, extra live has noclue about what you did
[3:26:19] <srkAres> killing everyone sounds like a good ending to me
[3:26:19] <Dragon_Batman> true
[3:26:20] <complicatedclarity> do you get to fight big snek?
[3:26:21] <+Kangumosa> lumpy ending, kek
[3:26:22] <%Zaramoth> what part of your screen are you watching when fighting? your guy their guy or more specifically their sword because you should be watching their sword the whole time
[3:26:24] <arfsm95> @AngriestPat remember the eyes on the inside? the look within are JUST THAT
[3:26:26] <pshuuu> the guy you send to the doctor guy moves along the path and then later dies when you kill a thing
[3:26:27] <talfurt> thats when its the best
[3:26:30] <+8framelag> best time
[3:26:31] <%El_Desperad0> How would anyone know this game is brand new

[3:27:49] <%Nobrev> have you not picked up any jizo statues...?
[3:27:51] <%Reizie_Etherealm> More importantly than what it is, what does it do in game tho?

[3:55:06] <+GrimSquirrel> its a giraffe centipede,
[3:55:07] <CrimsonFox777> Maybe that's what they thought a Giraffe was back then in whenever this game takes place in.
[3:55:13] <%connos_livereview> that FUCKN better be CANNON ARM
[3:55:14] <complicatedclarity> @nina96 long arm the centipede giraffe

[3:55:28] <pectusumbra> MARIO CAPE
[3:55:28] <+xelshion> @AngriestPat Centipede is the enemy type. Long-arm means its a strong one of the species. Giraffe is its name.

[3:56:18] <OrochiSheewa> if you finished reading, it said it opens them up for a abackstab

[3:59:08] <FeedbacK7777> @AngriestPat you can do it without diving but its hard
[3:59:08] <%doc_ock_rokc> This is a 3d metaroid game

[3:59:31] <%Reizie_Etherealm> There's vore potential tho
[3:59:38] <battlefield900> @Rakenshin that's salt water he wouldn't survive
[3:59:39] <pectusumbra> this looks lucrative
[3:59:40] <stabbityrabbit> By the way, I wanna call it now that that snake ends up being super important.
[3:59:46] <blackbookalpha> find a hiding spot and stab it in the eye
[3:59:46] <abakkus> whats up Jörmungandr
[3:59:48] <CrimsonFox777> So does this guy have gills or something? Seem's like he can stay under water for quite some time.
[3:59:49] <Splatterfest> can you kill it here?
[3:59:50] <Stay_Hydrated_Bot> @angriestpat stayhyBottle You've been live for just over 4 hours. By this point in your broadcast you should have consumed at least 16oz (480mL) of water to maintain optimum hydration.

[4:03:37] <%MelBrooksKA> Even after bloodborne?
[4:03:38] <+0oki> Does pay has 3 lives now?
[4:03:38] <+Zeklin_Marr> If you're going off on the monkeys just wait until you get to the random pair of legs sticking out of the ground
[4:03:40] <blackbookalpha> Monkey Mob down there
[4:03:42] <Darren716> Remember, go watch the Mass Effect stream for reference

[4:03:44] <%C0baltCrusade> ok so basically,
[4:03:45] <fmc009> ... but she beat bloodborne
[4:03:46] <complicatedclarity> she did the bloodborne real good

[4:04:06] <MarylandJutsu> @devanmuse I watched someone play it. ITS GREAT
[4:04:11] <%Fenrirlives> It'd be cool just to see her give it a shot, at least until the hand ruptures set in
[4:04:11] <Doodle_Taco> THAT MONKEY WAS INNOCENT
[4:04:17] <%joylent_blue> the other ones also allowed for brute force more i feel, this game you have to actually git gud

[4:21:50] <%Svanyr> I aint even mad
[4:21:52] <%galaxyswirl> i thought dancer would be a ranged dps, i was right @AngriestPat
[4:21:53] <+xelomaimhov> Dancer was FUN in11
[4:21:54] <Ahk_90> but I love to hear MMO rants
[4:21:54] <$keye90> @angriestpat do you think the 13 FFXIV shard worlds we travel to will be reimaginations of the main series title worlds?
[4:21:54] <+eeyoreoftwitch> Hey I haz a question hope anyone can answer. Are Headless just minibosses ?
[4:21:55] <Ozgho> Rubbing your greasy hand on THE BABY
[4:21:55] <%joylent_blue> don't care, but talk about it anyway nerd
[4:21:55] <%Ion_Laser> @ToastedAeolo yeah they look good lol
[4:21:57] <%connos_livereview> i dont play MMOS cos i dont want a job
[4:21:57] <+Wintermute_VRC> "healers"
[4:21:58] <ShichiNoBushi> From what I heard, there are too many DPS classes and not enough healers.
[4:21:59] <zerocruz> Nah
[4:22:00] <$valriot> I didnt expect it to be one, but yeah
[4:22:05] <albinobigfoot1> I am unfamiliar with the situation
[4:22:07] <%shawntk_> YEP
[4:22:09] <%Kangumosa> Dancer is gonna be a support 100%
[4:22:14] <Shishi1205> Also Tierzoo was involved in a Photo about a joke about one of the accused players (like a twitter group or sth), Parappa posted it @AngriestPat
[4:22:16] <%Noponiz> then dont put in dancer
[4:22:18] <+fatal_penguin_> @AngriestPat Are you a fry, seasoned fry, or onion ring man?
[4:22:19] <%depressed_skeleton> @AngriestPat Pat, Did you see the guy on twitter who flipped out that Sekiro didn't have a difficulty settings? So he Rage quit & traded the game in.
[4:22:20] <%Reizie_Etherealm> true
[4:22:20] <MarylandJutsu> FAir
[4:22:22] <conflict1914> I wonder if they'll pull the other tactics class, The Mime
[4:22:23] <+Wintermute_VRC> "Hello everyone, I'm just an extra health bar who contributes nothing to the party"
[4:22:23] <%klutch02> neat i guess?
[4:22:27] <%QueequegTheater> @AngriestPat Is the Steam version of FF7 seriously locked behind a confirmation email?
[4:22:31] <+xelomaimhov> The FFXI players are not allowed to be happy
[4:22:32] <%crimsonharvest> FF11 dancer was rad as heck and I'm sad we aren't getting a hybrid like i wanted
[4:22:35] <ShichiNoBushi> Dancer in Tactics was the offensive analog of the Bard.
[4:22:35] <LVDoomien> @AngriestPat what's full context of what the hell you just said?
[4:22:36] <Shishi1205> Something like You won't do it no balls
[4:22:42] <%Kangumosa> @Skeletorexplains LUL
[4:22:46] <Nina96> who?
[4:22:48] <%doc_ock_rokc> Fucking Game Journalists
[4:22:48] <$megamonmon123> @shishi1205 we doing guilt by association?
[4:22:49] <IminyourBase> why do you shake your sandwich?
[4:22:49] <%masneo2> sounds like DSP
[4:22:50] <%ScreamingMeat> Why?
[4:22:51] <%Noponiz> that is an excuse for dancer not being a healer but there is no excuse for not putting in a healer at all
[4:22:51] <+xelomaimhov> I guess?
[4:22:53] <MarylandJutsu> GIVE US THE WIERD
[4:22:55] <MagknO> does he want the game to be harder? monkaS
[4:22:55] <Shishi1205> ?
[4:23:01] <$valriot> The issue isnt Dancer not being a healer, its having no new Healer AT ALL
[4:23:04] <GhastlyZune> always
[4:23:05] <%nmaten> he jacks it off
[4:23:06] <deviljhojho94> im seeing it
[4:23:09] <%Fruitywhompus> it gives me anxiety
[4:23:09] <%depressed_skeleton> Shake the crumbs, i do that.

[4:23:19] <Ahk_90> how does dancing deal damage? It sounds weird
[4:23:19] <%connos_livereview> im surprised more people havent been bitching about sekiro tbh do you think they aree afraid ?
[4:23:20] <%Razputin217> Theres only one difficulty setting in a From Soft game, GIT GUD
[4:23:21] <$BuoyantSoul> Jerk that sandwich off

[4:23:22] <+Flambage> @AngriestPat Stop jerking off the sandwich
[4:23:22] <Kirby_Sauce> Why though?
[4:23:22] <MagknO> seems like a natural motion you've developed

[4:23:37] <42nfl19> Gotta shake the crumbs off,
[4:23:38] <+eeyoreoftwitch> Seems OCD
[4:23:39] <+xelomaimhov> You're getting rid of excess grease, or drippy sauces
[4:23:40] <$speedwagon1945> pat eating asmr streams only
[4:23:40] <WeebFever> sandwich genes
[4:23:40] <%IMDRanged> That is still a problem tho
[4:23:41] <$keye90> @angriestpat do you think the 13 FFXIV shard worlds we travel to will be reimaginations of the main series title worlds?
[4:23:41] <mr_ESB> Pops
[4:23:41] <stabbityrabbit> @AngriestPat Yeah, that's normal. You gotta get that sandwich flavor on that delicious styrofoam.
[4:23:42] <jerobees> Pat's dad confirmed OCD crazy person
[4:23:42] <Shishi1205> Adquired habits
[4:23:42] <+fatal_penguin_> @AngriestPat its to keep the crumbs contained on the plate
[4:23:43] <%Kangumosa> @AngriestPat I don't shake the sandwich if i don't like it
[4:23:43] <%depressed_skeleton> It makes sense though, You shake the crumbs off!

[4:23:45] <$megamonmon123> man pat has so much debuffs
[4:23:46] <%doc_ock_rokc> Yeah you probably observed the behavior when you where a child and picked it up
[4:23:49] <MarylandJutsu> Sounda bout right
[4:23:49] <%mastertwin2> It's like motivation, and SCUM
[4:23:53] <%MagickBurritoh> Jerked meat
[4:23:54] <IminyourBase> you can't escape your fate, you must shake your sandwich because it's hard wired into your tiny dna
[4:23:54] <alcors_wisdom> most people do stuff with their hands while they chew/eat
[4:23:56] <LVDoomien> Patrick Bovine????
[4:23:56] <OrochiSheewa> MEMES JACK
[4:23:57] <mcgaggles> Pat you're living a sitcom

[4:24:06] <$megamonmon123> where did pat put all his points into? being lucky probably
[4:24:07] <%crimsonharvest> there's a neurological thing some people get where oscillating or bouncing like that is soothing because they can't help doing it
[4:24:11] <%doc_ock_rokc> Its like me saying "Noon Thirty" instead of twelve thrity

[4:25:30] <IminyourBase> shut up
[4:25:30] <$keye90> cheer100 @angriestpat do you think the 13 FFXIV shard worlds we travel to will be reimaginations of the main series title worlds?
[4:25:31] <Kirby_Sauce> Spicy isn't really hot enough unless you tear up a little
[4:25:33] <dukenux> yeah?
[4:25:33] <%nmaten> by get rid of do you mean shit it out
[4:25:33] <%Kangumosa> Pat just did the EXACT Gnome "ooooooo"
[4:25:36] <+8framelag> best kind of spicy food
[4:25:40] <mcgaggles> Pat is Seinfeld monologuing
[4:25:40] <VRNK> spice is a damage type, not a static effect
[4:25:41] <T_sarr> where is this going? tf
[4:25:41] <dukenux> ...
[4:25:42] <cbdg> yep.
[4:25:44] <+Wintermute_VRC> Red eyes pat is weak to spicy fire
[4:25:45] <VRNK> *status
[4:25:45] <%IMDRanged> You are Hot Pepper Challenge Ready, Pat
[4:25:47] <%doc_ock_rokc> Then it hits atomic
[4:25:48] <%crimsonharvest> temporarily aware of your own body
[4:25:50] <$megamonmon123> the spicy debuff
[4:25:50] <%MelBrooksKA> Happens to me with tea
[4:25:54] <IminyourBase> that's called chemicals pat, love isn't real.
[4:25:55] <dukenux> iunno, i just like spicy
[4:25:56] <+Sochin_Iitsu> It's like when you eat spicy food in BotW
[4:25:56] <+xelomaimhov> The best spicy food makes your nose run
[4:25:57] <Amskip> Urine stops spicy piss on self
[4:25:57] <mcgaggles> A stream about nothing
[4:25:57] <%Prince_Kaboom> Prince_Kaboom subscribed with Twitch Prime. They've subscribed for 3 months! Sup from Edmonton!
[4:25:57] <zerocruz> Is puking littering
[4:26:00] <bleugh> not really
[4:26:03] <%connos_livereview> i prefer to be cold at all times
[4:26:03] <ShichiNoBushi> Spice is an ongoing damage status effect like Poison.
[4:26:06] <Miss_Ebola> I'm glad I joined to hear about "Inside heaters".
[4:26:11] <+fatal_penguin_> Green chili is the perfect type of spicy
[4:26:15] <%depressed_skeleton> Spiciest Pat
[4:26:16] <+xelomaimhov> Then it was just right
[4:26:18] <T_sarr> dont wipe it on the pajama!
[4:26:19] <dukenux> Now, is it a damage, or is it a BUFF
[4:26:20] <omen_setter> big damage
[4:26:22] <+Sochin_Iitsu> Spicy food is good for swollen sinuses
[4:26:23] <jerobees> @VRNK it's both. Like how you can have poison damage and a poison status
[4:26:23] <albinobigfoot1> i get that feeling with booze
[4:26:27] <+Segartner> hey everyone is this his first "episode"
[4:26:28] <dukenux> makes you feel pain less
[4:26:29] <%doc_ock_rokc> @AngriestPat Yeah I eat hotsauce when I'm sick to clear my sinuses
[4:26:32] <mcgaggles> Is pat Jerry or George
[4:26:36] <+Segartner> or how many sessions have passed
[4:26:36] <OrochiSheewa> the capsaicin turns up the sensitivity of your pain receptors
[4:26:37] <Kirby_Sauce> That's normal
[4:26:37] <%IMDRanged> The Spice must flow
[4:26:37] <%lewdskeletor13> @segartner Nope
[4:26:38] <%depressed_skeleton> Just shake the spice off
[4:26:40] <conflict1914> give em the old spicy piss
[4:26:40] <+Wintermute_VRC> The spice is the worm. The worm is the spice. The spice must flow.

[4:26:41] <complicatedclarity> @miss_ebola welcome to the piss stream where spicy food heats your insides zoneLove
[4:26:44] <+Sochin_Iitsu> Pat stop dying
[4:26:45] <%Kangumosa> god damn i thought something disconnected from my laptop
[4:26:51] <mr_ESB> Fuuuuuhuuuuuuu deep breaths
[4:26:52] <IminyourBase> i'd watch you do that
[4:26:53] <%doc_ock_rokc> Yeah I'm like that too
[4:26:54] <OrochiSheewa> or was it heat receptors
[4:26:56] <Plague_bagel> paige confirm this
[4:26:56] <Shishi1205> The spice just tricks your brain, it doesn't actually dmg you (unless its black pepepr) @AngriestPat
[4:26:57] <%crimsonharvest> keistering those chiles
[4:26:58] <Darren716> Ghost pupper?
[4:26:59] <+earthboy2k> When will pat have a heartattack on stream
[4:27:00] <dukenux> Do it live on stream
[4:27:01] <$megamonmon123> every day you are being replaced with a different pat
[4:27:01] <Shishi1205> That irritates
[4:27:02] <%AllyBeeBoo> if i donate £100 will you eat a ghost pepper on stream?
[4:27:05] <$BuoyantSoul> Ghost Wowee
[4:27:07] <%lewdskeletor13> Has Paige done that?
[4:27:12] <mr_ESB> What kind of sandwich?
[4:27:14] <%Kangumosa> @AllyBeeBoo
[4:27:15] <libraDoom> id sub for that
[4:27:16] <%doc_ock_rokc> @Darren716 Ghost Pepper is the best
[4:27:19] <$megamonmon123> yesterday's pat has a higher resistance than today's pat
[4:27:20] <%connos_livereview> if you dance without rythm you wont atract the worm
[4:27:20] <omen_setter> stay safe spice ghost
[4:27:24] <%Kangumosa> @AllyBeeBoo I will too
[4:27:26] <OrochiSheewa> ghoeeeeeees
[4:27:27] <dukenux> capsaicine works on your pain receptors
[4:27:29] <conflict1914> i think your asshole has taste buds which is why it burns when it comes out
[4:27:29] <+8framelag> when it's coming out it's no fun
[4:27:32] <+Segartner> @AngriestPat at what spot are you at in the game?
[4:27:33] <Shishi1205> Cold Spicy
[4:27:34] <%IMDRanged> Spice extends life. Spice expands concsiousness. the Spice is vital to space travel.
[4:27:35] <cbdg> tell that to my stomach, I love spicy food but it fucks me up
[4:27:40] <VRNK> dont forget about piperine
[4:27:41] <Amskip> As opposed to the freashmaker
[4:27:41] <%ArcanumMBD> !uptime
[4:27:42] <@Moobot> I've been playing this game for how long? Oh only 4h 27m.
[4:27:47] <$megamonmon123> cant you die from too spicy?
[4:27:50] <Ahk_90> well, it does cause vasidilatation, so technically they could do damage
[4:27:51] <dukenux> menthol is the thing in mint
[4:27:53] <jerobees> Mint is spICY
[4:27:57] <dukenux> that makes you feel cool
[4:27:59] <MementoExtasis> the spice must flow
[4:28:01] <IminyourBase> yes you can
[4:28:01] <%Kangumosa> Sort of
[4:28:02] <Nina96> DO IT @AngriestPat
[4:28:04] <+Sochin_Iitsu> Well, capsaicin is still toxic to humans. That's why it's burning
[4:28:06] <%PlainSimpleTailor> Yes you can
[4:28:07] <Just_a_Draco> now there's a combo I'd rather not try
[4:28:08] <%Kangumosa> the spice can explode your stomach
[4:28:08] <dukenux> It's... plausible
[4:28:11] <%lewdskeletor13> Mint is just cold spicy right? @angriestpat
[4:28:12] <%PlainSimpleTailor> Then that counts
[4:28:12] <IminyourBase> so you can die from too spicy
[4:28:13] <%crimsonharvest> You can't die from the spice but you can experience shock from the spice
[4:28:14] <%doc_ock_rokc> @dukenux Mint?
[4:28:17] <Shishi1205> Im pretty sure you can die bc of a hearth attack if you freak out
[4:28:17] <SunsetJack> You can suffocate I guess?
[4:28:20] <+fatal_penguin_> Is Lava spicy?
[4:28:22] <Shishi1205> But not really
[4:28:23] <+Wintermute_VRC> You can die from too much anything
[4:28:23] <IminyourBase> you don't die from venom, you die from the reaction of the venom. GOT IT
[4:28:24] <OrochiSheewa> you can die from the shock
[4:28:27] <mcgaggles> Carolina reaper videos
[4:28:32] <Doodle_Taco> @angriestpat Pat I'm surprised you like spicy food considering your fear of shitting yourself
[4:28:34] <dukenux> @doc_ock_rokc menthol is the substance in mint that makes you feel cold impression
[4:28:34] <Plague_bagel> ie: brain dumb
[4:28:35] <omen_setter> you become todoroki if you eat spice and mint together
[4:28:35] <%depressed_skeleton> Spiciest Pat is strong.
[4:28:35] <VRNK> the body is the ultimate quisling
[4:28:39] <%PlainSimpleTailor> So, it can kill you
[4:28:39] <MrGarettLefebvre> The Carolina Reaper has put people in the hospital
[4:28:40] <alphapneumatic> you can die to the reaction you have to bullets too
[4:28:41] <%dave323dave> peppers evolved spicy seeds to disincentivize mammals from crushing the seeds with their grinding teeth. Birds on the other hands swallow the seeds and can distribute them through their waste
[4:28:51] <Tampaoster> So, YES you can die from spicy LUL
[4:28:51] <%IMDRanged> Scoville Tolerance
[4:28:53] <Nina96> NOTHING
[4:28:55] <$megamonmon123> so condiment king is the deadliest batman villian if he uses hot sause?
[4:28:55] <mcgaggles> Pat: Carolina
[4:28:56] <cbdg> "yeah I'm getting my stomach pumped"
[4:28:57] <complicatedclarity> spicy food is a debuff
[4:28:59] <%Kangumosa> Hottest shit i had was a trinidad scorpion
[4:28:59] <deviljhojho94> i dont wanna imagine that
[4:29:01] <%connos_livereview> rest in paige
[4:29:01] <%doc_ock_rokc> FUCK THE REAPERS
[4:29:04] <IminyourBase> there is a human limit tho
[4:29:05] <%ScreamingMeat> Instant heart attack
[4:29:06] <mcgaggles> only rednecks could make it
[4:29:07] <+Wintermute_VRC> You can die from being killed too much
[4:29:08] <conflict1914> The lupus fights the spice
[4:29:10] <+daddy2411> Hey Pat just finished DMC V it was the hypest shit. How have you been?
[4:29:14] <deviljhojho94> YEYEYEYEYEYE

[4:29:21] <mr_ESB> Paige not fan of hot foods :(
[4:29:21] <+Sochin_Iitsu> More like Suckiro. High five
[4:29:23] <Shishi1205> Have you tried Capsaicin Cream @AngriestPat (like medicine)
[4:29:25] <%ScreamingMeat> You never switched it
[4:29:25] <%depressed_skeleton> Stream 24/7
[4:29:28] <mcgaggles> can you die from Sekiro?
[4:29:29] <deviljhojho94> D:
[4:29:29] <$megamonmon123> condiment king is op with ghost pepper sause. batman has no chance
[4:29:31] <complicatedclarity> spicy food awakens the goblins
[4:29:31] <formlessTwitch> Parrots love spicey as shit peppers, mainly because they lack as many taste receptors as we do and can't feel the burn
[4:29:32] <OrochiSheewa> NotLikeThis
[4:29:33] <%connos_livereview> peech would rhyme better fuck
[4:29:34] <Shishi1205> That thing lasts for a hot minute
[4:29:36] <%C0baltCrusade> what if you made a delicious carolina reaper mustard? @angriestpat
[4:29:37] <%depressed_skeleton> sticky butt
[4:29:39] <dukenux> wtf
[4:29:40] <+Wintermute_VRC> 死
[4:29:42] <%nmaten> pat spilled pee on the couch
[4:29:44] <FiftyFiveP> coolest boss/ sequene so far pat?
[4:29:45] <%Kangumosa> Trinidad Scorpion was pretty nice, really smoky flavour
[4:29:45] <Ahk_90> In any case, eating spicy is better for your health than eating salty
[4:29:45] <stabbityrabbit> @AngriestPat So what's the over/under on the dragon turning out to be a horrifying monster in your opinion?
[4:29:45] <%lewdskeletor13> Ugh you’re gonna play the game? I’m outta here apatDab
[4:29:48] <+fatal_penguin_> Remember, Pat: This is a sneaking mission. Try to remember some of the basics of Ninjitsu
[4:29:50] <%crimsonharvest> yeah spicy peppers are nature's liars
[4:29:50] <conflict1914> i'm gonna tell Paige
[4:29:51] <%Mateus84723> i can see the stain
[4:29:52] <jerobees> Carbonated pee
[4:29:54] <Khorneflakes_> So that's what that dark stain on your pants was Kappa
[4:29:55] <srkAres> the porn couch had much worse
[4:29:58] <omen_setter> that vanilla orange coke tho

[4:30:01] <$shurtal> *schlorp*
[4:30:01] <$keye90> @angriestpat do you think the 13 FFXIV shard worlds we travel to will be reimaginations of the main series title worlds?
[4:30:04] <lols_royce> absorbed via buttmosis
[4:30:08] <dukenux> All that spicy butt gas dried the coke
[4:30:10] <OrochiSheewa> @AngriestPat favorite boss so far?
[4:30:12] <MrGarettLefebvre> probably causes a swelling in the throat for some people which can constrict their ability to breathe
[4:30:19] <Kirby_Sauce> Aren't dragons monsters by default?
[4:30:21] <%nmaten> what if this game is a prequel to dark souls?
[4:30:23] <%C0baltCrusade> im honestly starting to think the dragon is a great one from bloodborne
[4:30:24] <alphapneumatic> the dragon will be a DS dragon
[4:30:28] <mcgaggles> @AngriestPat can you die from your shadow dying twice?
[4:30:30] <MarylandJutsu> BIG PLAGUE
[4:30:32] <Plague_bagel> yeah no shit thats a curse
[4:30:32] <%lewdskeletor13> This is Fromsoft, it’s ALWAYS A CURSE
[4:30:32] <Khorneflakes_> It defies the natural cycle probably
[4:30:33] <$shurtal> Bearer, Seek, Seek, Lest
[4:30:34] <VRNK> everyone starts drawing horny art?
[4:30:34] <%galaxyswirl> only if you suck tho @AngriestPat

[4:30:51] <MarylandJutsu> Miyazaki be like that
[4:30:51] <%Kangumosa> 6/10
[4:30:55] <+azure22900> Basically its DArk Souls, but when the actual shit is going down.
[4:30:55] <T_sarr> what does self-ressing do?
[4:30:59] <%galaxyswirl> dont die and no dragon rot, ez

[4:31:24] <$shurtal> say*
[4:31:25] <%connos_livereview> no Berserk sword 3/10
[4:31:26] <Kirby_Sauce> The emotion of "Restraint"
[4:31:28] <Shishi1205> How much dialogue might he have
[4:31:30] <%Gogogolem> @AngriestPat Pat wolf has like mega ptsd.
[4:31:31] <jubejube56> That's a iron code thing
[4:31:34] <+netrac> in DS is people trying to fix inmortaility here is people is seeking inmortaility
[4:31:35] <%Kangumosa> Wolf is literally Lucatiel
[4:31:35] <%Gogogolem> @AngriestPat He died.
[4:31:39] <+Wintermute_VRC> He's Japanese
[4:31:39] <+PenmanLupine> I just can't wait for the end where its revealed Wolf has to go to Yharnam
[4:31:40] <MrGarettLefebvre> Pat would you be interested if From Software did a remake of Demon's Souls and made it play like Sekiro?
[4:31:41] <%Kangumosa> His face is turning all Lucatiel @AngriestPat
[4:31:43] <+daddy2411> You turn into a buttmad loser when you hollow out though

[4:32:11] <deviljhojho94> Sounds indian
[4:32:15] <T_sarr> charles
[4:32:21] <Ahk_90> I mean, coming back from the dead is one of the most universally unnnatural and harrowing experience in all litterature (and real life, if we can say so)
[4:32:30] <+8framelag> inb4 the heir is actually 1000 year old dragon
[4:32:31] <deviljhojho94> ye
[4:32:31] <%connos_livereview> plague.jpeg
[4:32:31] <$Tarcanist_> he's the voice actor of charles smith in rdr2 @angriestpat

[4:47:42] <34thLab> Have you ever been so angry you used your own severed head a a weapon?
[4:47:42] <+daddy2411> Hit the stump where the head was at for big dick damage
[4:47:43] <CrimsonFox777> @MarylandJutsu If only that logic worked in Skullgirls.
[4:47:43] <All_towers> Huh, he brings his head up to his neck to scream. Don't that beat all

[5:09:40] <+PunishedMimikyu> i had planned on it @HentaiSenpai9K
[5:09:40] <%doc_ock_rokc> @Scourgie86 It fucked up the game because he didn't get far enough on the quest to do it
[5:09:41] <%El_Desperad0> @Scourgie86 some fuck face lied to Pat and got an NPC killed.
[5:09:45] <MoulesFritz> @AngriestPat he MIGHT be at Illusion Hall

[5:09:55] <Dementedpenguin> @Retrocop87 Someone in chat told Pat to do something. It didn't end well.
[5:09:56] <%galaxyswirl> how do people know so much about a game that came out 2 days ago??????
[5:10:01] <%Kangumosa> apatPat
[5:10:04] <%Scourgie86> OOOOOOOOH! ok fuck that guy
[5:10:06] <%ArcanumMBD> @AngriestPat there's like 3 things you can do with that big guy
[5:10:12] <%ArcanumMBD> @AngriestPat all mutually exclusive
[5:10:13] <leole11> mistakes were made
[5:10:15] <deviljhojho94> I didnt even get to see it
[5:10:15] <MagknO> People have beaten this game twice now on some streams
[5:10:15] <+Dragon4234> @AngriestPat Oh yeah, you miss out on those items
[5:10:16] <+netrac> guides on just released games are often super wrong
[5:10:16] <%TrulyIncandescent> TrulyIncandescent subscribed with Twitch Prime. They've subscribed for 2 months, currently on a 1 month streak! Sick, was hoping to catch you playing this. Love your taste in games.
[5:10:18] <+Shadicara> There's gotta be a way to get him back
[5:10:18] <%barkon345> @galaxyswirl other streamers
[5:10:19] <%El_Desperad0> @galaxyswirl that's what I'm saying
[5:10:20] <dukenux> @galaxyswirl they don't, as was demonstrated LUL
[5:10:26] <deviljhojho94> give him the finger
[5:10:29] <%doc_ock_rokc> @galaxyswirl Stupid shit
[5:10:30] <%connos_livereview> yeah finger him
[5:10:31] <%Valentinius_Anodyne> @galaxyswirl Hint: They probably don't
[5:10:32] <+creamandsugar> try finger, but monkey
[5:10:34] <+extra_thick_rick> LUL LUL
[5:10:35] <%crimsonharvest> You weren't going to use them anyway
[5:10:35] <$Retrocop87> can't he reload a prior save?
[5:10:37] <%TheGreatBamBe> Tilted
[5:10:38] <%lewdskeletor13> Take out your anger on these goons
[5:10:39] <+roach__> pats ready to go full kamiya on us.
[5:10:40] <albinobigfoot1> angryest pat reaching peak angry
[5:10:40] <deviljhojho94> didnt do nuttin
[5:10:40] <Shortnamer> @AngriestPat KappaPride
[5:10:40] <%TheGreatBamBe> Beyond belief
[5:10:41] <+SomeOtherNeb> lionSalt
[5:10:43] <TranquilTurnip> oh no the brain goblins
[5:10:50] <TakesGuts> it worked
[5:10:52] <MarylandJutsu> FRUSTRATIon....GETTING BIGGER
[5:10:54] <dukenux> Use that Anger, bOI
[5:10:54] <%El_Desperad0> Dis you ban the guy?
[5:10:55] <%joylent_blue> let this be a lesson to everyone here, don't backseat because you're not as smart as you think :)
[5:11:03] <%Deft_Thought> @galaxyswirl Folks got early copies of this game and since it got a PC release, people datamine as well as blast through the game
[5:11:03] <%shotgang86> Is this a goddamn monkey using two sword and Pat cat called it?
[5:11:03] <KazMkII> Pat's playing tilted
[5:11:03] <TranquilTurnip> 20 bucks says Pat restarts off stream
[5:11:04] <%sabertoothzombie> wtf did the finger do?
[5:11:07] <deviljhojho94> what does it do?
[5:11:08] <Shishi1205> So he can attack allies
[5:11:08] <%ArcanumMBD> @AngriestPat you can farm crafting materials from enemies. You don't miss anything exclusive from not sending him to the merchant
[5:11:09] <%Deft_Thought> It ain't impossible
[5:11:10] <dukenux> Pull my Devil Finger
[5:11:10] <%crimsonharvest> A P E O U T
[5:11:11] <pigeontactician> use it in a group of them
[5:11:11] <+0oki> Here we can see that the dragon rot has started to affect pat
[5:11:12] <%Reizie_Etherealm> I'm praying that the quest can still be saved in that illusion hall or whatever but I don't think I have enough prayer beads for this to work
[5:11:13] <+netrac> enrage works when theres more than one
[5:11:14] <LegendaryDorkKnight> at the end of the day it's just a video games not that big a deal
[5:11:15] <cbdg> he'll attack other enemies, not very useful when it's just you
[5:11:16] <+HibbityDoo> If there more than one they attack each other
[5:11:16] <%connos_livereview> moar parry opportunity ?
[5:11:19] <+Tevvy> enrage makes them attack allies, this guy doesnt have any allies so.
[5:11:19] <Videogamer4> the finger makes animals attack other enemies @angriestpat
[5:11:20] <%Fenrirlives> @AngriestPat perhaps he attacks his allies in this state?
[5:11:20] <$HentaiSenpai9K> @joylent_blue Hes wasn't even backseating he was trolling
[5:11:21] <%mastertwin2> Probably attacks his allies type effect
[5:11:21] <reinbachthe3rd> I think the whistle works better when there are other targets around since, "it makes them lose sight of who is friend or foe."
[5:11:22] <%kenpachi9211> DEATH COUNT 163
[5:11:23] <battlefield900> he attack allies
[5:11:25] <MoulesFritz> @AngriestPat enrage can mkae groups fight each other
[5:11:28] <abakkus> i would assume using it on groups would make them all go ham on each other? @AngriestPat
[5:11:31] <%Kangumosa> The whistle cancelled the monkey's child benefits
[5:11:31] <eastmonroe> he would attack other enemies
[5:11:31] <MarylandJutsu> Enrage works when there are other monkeys nearby and you HAVENT been noticed
[5:11:38] <albinobigfoot1> pat, enraging him makes him pissed off
[5:11:40] <+Tevvy> you can be noticed.
[5:11:42] <%kenpachi9211> DEATH COUNT 164
[5:11:43] <%Demon_Shadow4> f
[5:11:43] <SeventyForce> So rage is just friendly fire mode?
[5:11:45] <albinobigfoot1> thats the point
[5:11:48] <MonocleCoyote> @AngriestPat i had the quest to bring a big guy and i give the pinwheel to the guy and there was not an option to send him to the merchant, he just ask to be spirited away, which you do with the fan
[5:11:50] <JT137> 死
[5:11:53] <+Dragon4234> @AngriestPat I ended the quest the exact same way. That samurai you sent down to the dungeon is the other person you coulda sent to the merchant but ya sent him to his doom.
[5:11:59] <%joylent_blue> HentaiSenpai9K nah he seemed like he really thought he was right, which honestly is more frustrating
[5:12:11] <kiryuva> !uptime
[5:12:11] <@Moobot> I've been playing this game for how long? Oh only 5h 12m.
[5:12:22] <deviljhojho94> What a fuck up this has been
[5:12:22] <Bouldus> @Latch77 wait is pat still trying to send a samurai to a guy in a cave?
[5:12:23] <%Flannel_Pajams> where did the monkey even get swords?
[5:12:24] <%crimsonharvest> so with the bright red ass are these primates Baboons?
[5:12:26] <%lewdskeletor13> Chat I have a cat in my lap sipsipElmo sipsipElmo sipsipElmo sipsipElmo sipsipElmo
[5:12:30] <%shockzndrawe> on a scale from 1 to 10 how upset are you
[5:12:30] <$Retrocop87> Pat rolled his saves though, right?
[5:12:41] <Doodle_Taco> @lewdskeletor13 Pet him
[5:12:41] <%StEmlosWater> Speaking of being wrong, theres nothing special about speaking to Hanbei until you get another item. It isn't bad to do, but pointless
[5:12:46] <libraDoom> @Flannel_Pajams thats japan
[5:12:48] <%shockzndrawe> this game has saves?
[5:12:50] <MrGarettLefebvre> I stepped out for a moment to avoid the snap, how many people survived?
[5:12:53] <Teh_Un> So did no one clip that moment?
[5:12:53] <%Deft_Thought> The Monkey trained with Musashi, clearly
[5:12:55] <$Retrocop87> it doesn't?
[5:12:58] <%shotgang86> @lewdskeletor13 I have a pug apatJpeg apatJpeg apatJpeg
[5:13:03] <dukenux> I got my whole feed filled with people playing Sekiro, except Limmy who's just chatting LUL
[5:13:06] <albinobigfoot1> The whole point of the finger is to piss off monkeys, it has no effect other than enraging babboons
[5:13:07] <deviljhojho94> How come we can't play as a monkey?
[5:13:08] <%lewdskeletor13> Pet the pug
[5:13:08] <%Deft_Thought> I have nothing in my lap :(
[5:13:10] <+Dragon4234> @AngriestPat Mistakes have been made. Gotta love that new game feel.
[5:13:14] <sharpington_> the monkeys are macaques
[5:13:14] <+Shadicara> Chat was the real final boss to Sekiro all along LUL
[5:13:19] <dukenux> (might play Sekiro anyway)

[5:31:20] <+netrac> not inmunity against blunt maybe=

[5:31:36] <PlatinumWyvern> is it just me or does that kid sound like ash from pokemon

[5:41:15] <Bouldus> @AlexDemille Pat doesnt have knees
[5:41:16] <MagknO> it kind of*
[5:41:21] <%ScreamingMeat> "Terror" being an instant death status is fucking stupid. Sekiro is a battle hardened bad ass and now he can die because he got scared and had a heart attack

[6:14:44] <Zaka51> This looks like a Fromsoft game but with the speed turned up 300%
[6:14:44] <TranquilTurnip> so the trick is interupting his air game
[6:14:49] <Shishi1205> Not rn but he did used them
[6:14:49] <Dementedpenguin> PogChamp
[6:14:51] <%SpamKingRathalos> they can be felled.

[6:24:45] <SnaKemuho> @kr_black he's like the only proper armored enemy in the game
[6:24:45] <+netrac> FUNFACT: he can only be killed via falling

[6:24:47] <+Shadicara> That was amazing and he's totally not dead LUL
[6:24:47] <+VoytekBus> and that's the last time we'll ever see him ever again
[6:24:48] <%MagickBurritoh> So in NG+ do you keep upgrades?

[6:24:58] <%Sulliman34> i think you can strip armor off using the spear
[6:24:59] <MarylandJutsu> @lovebass4stuff his son we assume
[6:24:59] <%doc_ock_rokc> You can only kill him via throwing him off the bridge
[6:25:00] <Caidezes> He's Robert's dad, Pat.
[6:25:02] <lizard0tm> Who the fuck is Robert?

[6:30:49] <%DirtyGaijin> bork
[6:30:49] <%doc_ock_rokc> whats Unseen aid?
[6:30:50] <%connos_livereview> unseen aids
[6:30:51] <Ravenian96> @AngriestPat they are probably here because you went to ghost village first
[6:30:59] <%ArcanumMBD> @StewTheGreat did you do the mist village after this zone? because i believe thats the trigger
[6:31:00] <+xSHARKPUNCHx> i also didnt have ghosts here but im still fairly early in game
[6:31:01] <%lewdskeletor13> The music seems great
[6:31:03] <Shortnamer> @doc_ock_rokc it's aid that you don't see
[6:31:04] <blackbookalpha> Chris Evans: Unseen Aiddssssssss
[6:31:07] <Bouldus> isnt there an item that makes the game harder? like a bell or something?
[6:31:07] <pectusumbra> okay it sounds like I missed some SHIT
[6:31:08] <Doodle_Taco> Good job puppet LUL
[6:31:08] <CSeriesJTYPE> the music is great
[6:31:11] <%StewTheGreat> yeah I just got to the mist village
[6:31:11] <+Shadicara> I think it's all the guys you murdered
[6:31:20] <Ner234> @doc_ock_rokc Death penalty reduced
[6:31:21] <%DirtyGaijin> its a horrible fruit
[6:31:22] <Dakuu75> Oh look. Sekiro works for peta... he likes to kill all the dogos he "saves" too
[6:31:24] <SnaKemuho> @doc_ock_rokc Buddha makes you not lose money / xp on death
[6:31:25] <aimlesshealer> You don't know what a persimmon is?
[6:31:25] <albinobigfoot1> wtf is unseen aid?

[6:32:27] <%Fenrirlives> can't come back twice!
[6:32:27] <SnaKemuho> I wish you could make it higher than 30%, an not only lower it
[6:32:31] <Saltmeisterr> WTF
[6:32:31] <OrochiSheewa> as the manperor of mankind would say: DELET
[6:32:36] <%Reizie_Etherealm> Dying with no one to bury them
[6:32:39] <Nina96> ctrl + delete
[6:32:41] <%DirtyGaijin> @blackbookalpha or just murder everything
[6:32:44] <Dragon_Batman> good to know
[6:32:46] <theamazingroberto> god this game really is just weeb souls
[6:32:50] <+thebadpope> That dude was just minding his own business until Pat started killing his pet monkeys.
[6:32:51] <+matrixManipulator> Sent to Punish for Deleting Fatty?
[6:32:54] <%laserbeaming> you must be Gravelorded or something
[6:32:56] <Zaka51> it's just Weeb Souls
[6:32:56] <blackbookalpha> @DirtyGaijin lol
[6:33:02] <Bouldus> im really starting to feel like these are part of the death mechanic
[6:33:08] <+Okicop> interesting so only on illusions not phantoms hmm
[6:33:09] <+Shadicara> Nah weeb souls is code vein LUL
[6:33:10] <Doodle_Taco> FAN'EM
[6:33:11] <Saltmeisterr> apparitions?
[6:33:14] <BunnyEmperor> ghost bleed
[6:33:22] <zebult> monkaS
[6:33:27] <%JJCheeker> If you have ghosts you have everything 👻
[6:33:27] <%Reizie_Etherealm> Fan doesn't do anything to these guys during the last encounter tho
[6:33:28] <Dakuu75> I love the filter these guys have. Reminds me of Raven using her powers in the classic Teen Titans
[6:33:29] <blackbookalpha> Fan didn't work
[6:33:30] <theamazingroberto> it's like somebody looked at dark souls and said "nah not japanesey enough"
[6:33:37] <$hooppawesomeness> @bouldus Its either death mechanic or progress in the game imo
[6:33:48] <Shishi1205> They don't even drop money
[6:33:50] <+netrac> loading tip says something about vengeful spirits and twillight
[6:33:51] <%laserbeaming> Those are obviously gravelord phantoms sent by Nito
[6:33:55] <%SpamKingRathalos> Clearly
[6:34:00] <Bouldus> @hooppawesomeness yea those seems the most likely answers, unless pats used the bell item
[6:34:03] <%SpamKingRathalos> Can't escape Nito
[6:34:06] <Bouldus> @hooppawesomeness then maybe its that
[6:34:07] <Aydarkzero> thats not very nito Kappa
[6:34:07] <%Deft_Thought> How many of these fucks are there?
[6:34:10] <%StEmlosWater> @theamazingroberto Apparently, the creators of dark souls said so!
[6:34:10] <%Reizie_Etherealm> Good stuff!
[6:34:23] <%SpamKingRathalos> nice scarf
[6:34:26] <Dakuu75> Question: What're those red circles above the health bar?
[6:34:27] <+Okicop> sorry I thought it worked on ghosts
[6:34:32] <%doc_ock_rokc> kinda yea
[6:34:34] <+netrac> so probably is tied with progression
[6:34:38] <Shishi1205> pips
[6:34:40] <+thebadpope> But for real, Pat's really good at this game.
[6:34:41] <%doc_ock_rokc> its like bloodborne time zones
[6:34:47] <Saltmeisterr> hey so like whats the deal with the armoured dude?
[6:34:48] <SnaKemuho> I've met these chucklefucks too, and went here last, so probably yeah
[6:34:50] <Shishi1205> yikes
[6:34:52] <Zaka51> so are you a samurai or a ninja
[6:34:53] <%lewdskeletor13> @dakuu75 The amount of health bars they have. Each circle represents on bar
[6:34:54] <%Reizie_Etherealm> GRENADES?
[6:34:54] <Aydarkzero> bombs!?
[6:34:54] <Bouldus> @AngriestPat trying to decide if the ghosts are due to progression or part of the death mechanic
[6:34:56] <%DirtyGaijin> @Dakuu75 its a meter for if you can resurrect or not
[6:34:56] <+Shadicara> Monk grenades
[6:34:57] <%SpamKingRathalos> BOMBS
[6:34:57] <$hooppawesomeness> i just did this area without progressing a lot and theres so few enemies here compared to you
[6:34:57] <%Meidolaon> Meidolaon subscribed at Tier 1. They've subscribed for 22 months, currently on a 22 month streak! Two months from two years! Have fun with Sekiro, yo!

[6:35:08] <$HentaiSenpai9K> Grenaderangs
[6:35:11] <%Kangumosa> Michael bay has taken over
[6:35:21] <Shishi1205> That move is cool
[6:35:22] <Dragon_Batman> Sounds similar to the Hemwick village is after the moon is up
[6:35:22] <%Reizie_Etherealm> The village hidden in the gunpowder??
[6:35:25] <+netrac> Buddhist Mortar
[6:35:26] <FiftyFiveP> wtf they track???
[6:35:29] <%doc_ock_rokc> no
[6:35:34] <Ravenian96> somebody learned the flying paper bomb jutsu
[6:35:39] <OrochiSheewa> dynamic difficulty system? 🤔
[6:35:40] <Saltmeisterr> nope
[6:35:43] <%SpamKingRathalos> Always visit Hemwick before the moon rises
[6:35:48] <%Reizie_Etherealm> Look at this place! Reminds me of Kyoto
[6:35:50] <SnaKemuho> how does From manage to make every new game sound juicier than the last one
[6:35:51] <+KR_Black> So we just killing holly man now ?
[6:35:51] <aimlesshealer> This is how Pat the psychologist would have spoken to his patients
[6:35:51] <Bouldus> @OrochiSheewa it seems like it
[6:35:52] <%JJCheeker> i like ghost... especially the Band
[6:35:55] <%InkblotBlues> So is this supposed to take place in Japan or is it fantasy-totally-not-Japan?
[6:35:58] <Restainly> Do u guys like puzzle bosses?

[6:39:21] <Dakuu75> berserker-barrage ALL day
[6:39:24] <SnaKemuho> it was a human giraffe
[6:39:36] <albinobigfoot1> he was probably named giraffe because he really likes going to the zoo
[6:39:37] <%Deft_Thought> When you die do you just have a % chance of infecting people or is it a certain number of deaths thing?
[6:39:42] <%Kangumosa> rekt
[6:39:55] <LegendaryDorkKnight> literally did the same thong twice
[6:39:55] <%Typhaeon> Straight out of SamSho
[6:39:56] <BunnyEmperor> "Centipede"

[6:40:08] <%rumtumtugnutz> I think its just RNG
[6:40:08] <%Typhaeon> Only less green and with two claws
[6:40:09] <%Reizie_Etherealm> So Giraffe was the other guy's name, weird

[6:44:26] <WeebFever> Pup snuff MASTER
[6:44:27] <SummonerMagno> Pat is becoming PETA with the amount of animals he is killing

[6:44:39] <LegendaryDorkKnight> driving is so much fun
[6:44:40] <%Edgy_Macaroon> house insurance then
[6:44:41] <theonlyxception> this game is like dark souls ninja gaiden sigma
[6:44:41] <%JJCheeker> He tried driving once but his feet couldn't reach the pedals
[6:44:43] <+Shadicara> You're not missing much really
[6:44:43] <blackbookalpha> same Pat
[6:44:43] <aimlesshealer> @InkblotBlues It all makes sense now
[6:44:44] <omen_setter> Cars ruined america
[6:44:44] <Dehlome> honorable shinobi, fucking slaying entire packs of wolves
[6:44:48] <+twohitgood> the world is better off without pat driving, if really think about it.
[6:44:49] <%SpamKingRathalos> driving is like the funnest thing ever
[6:44:50] <%Rakenshin> Pat would have a smart car
[6:44:50] <Saltmeisterr> too short to drive
[6:44:51] <LullabyBird> Geico: Lizards DIe Twice

[6:44:54] <$HentaiSenpai9K> Driving is super manly tho
[6:44:55] <%cylish> I wish I could go without a car
[6:44:56] <BunnyEmperor> but you are a nerd
[6:44:57] <OrochiSheewa> me too, waiting for the selfdriving ones
[6:44:58] <ShichiNoBushi> I guess I'm a nerd, then.
[6:44:59] <%laserbeaming> Self Driving Cars will save Pat
[6:44:59] <PrettyThickandStrongDyck> Pats never drove a car? I can't really believe that.
[6:45:02] <Shishi1205> Soe of us need cars to move
[6:45:02] <blackbookalpha> im glad the AI in this game is BORKED
[6:45:02] <%lewdskeletor13> Is it cause your feet can’t touch the pedal? @angriestpat
[6:45:03] <OkamiDude15> why would pay need to drive when he can ground trick all around montreal?
[6:45:03] <%Gogogolem> is jimmy dead?
[6:45:03] <%InkblotBlues> Don't listen to them Pat. Driving is horrifying.
[6:45:07] <Dakuu75> TAKE-THAT monk-minding-your-own-business~ lol
[6:45:07] <%JJCheeker> You should tie wooden blocks to your feet so you could drive
[6:45:08] <+King_floppy> *clap*
[6:45:08] <Mariakko> His feet can't reach he pedals .
[6:45:09] <%Gogogolem> no he is napping
[6:45:10] <%SpamKingRathalos> Driving is fun
[6:45:14] <+thebadpope> Is not driving a Canadian thing or a Pat thing?
[6:45:20] <%mastertwin2> I don't know about Canada, but most drivers in the American NE are garbage at it
[6:45:21] <%doc_ock_rokc> if only you had a whisle
[6:45:22] <Zaka51> not driving is a city thing.
[6:45:24] <%SpamKingRathalos> Stick your head out the window while driving
[6:45:26] <+mobius_won> driving is boring as fuck and i can't wait for autopilot to become the standard
[6:45:31] <captainthunderwolf> Sekiro, Japanese for, "Depopulate the forest"
[6:45:35] <Saltmeisterr> @AngriestPat why don't u ever use bloodsmoke?
[6:45:39] <Bouldus> @mobius_won same
[6:45:39] <aimlesshealer> All drivers everywhere are terrible, it seems
[6:45:39] <%doc_ock_rokc> Super large city thing
[6:45:40] <+Spenny_YO> Thanks for saving the environment by not driving cars, Pat :)
[6:45:41] <Restainly> Scariest boss in the game coming up
[6:45:41] <%daveronald> pat thing, I drive
[6:45:42] <buffmurffy> not driving is a city slicker thing
[6:45:43] <blue2red> i only drive down MT. Fuji while blasting eurobeat
[6:45:44] <BunnyEmperor> Pat as dwarf youre supposed to drive vehicles Kappa
[6:45:46] <%Gogogolem> yeah he live in a big ass city full of assholes
[6:45:48] <%JJCheeker> How is your public transportation @AngriestPat
[6:45:50] <omen_setter> it's inconceivably to have never driven a car if you live in an american suburb
[6:45:51] <MrGarettLefebvre> A certain city thing
[6:45:55] <%DirtyGaijin> City living, don't really need to with public transport id imagine
[6:45:59] <%ScreamingMeat> Rush Hour Every Hour
[6:45:59] <Zaka51> I live in a part of he country where having a car is a requirement to live and it's not great.
[6:46:00] <Darren716> What if you ever need to go out of the city though?
[6:46:00] <%InkblotBlues> @thebadpope Also when you have viable public transit it is a better option.
[6:46:02] <blackbookalpha> big boss, tiny man
[6:46:02] <$HentaiSenpai9K> Can't be as bad as Chicago
[6:46:03] <%doc_ock_rokc> He is mini though
[6:46:03] <aimlesshealer> @Spenny_YO This is the man who actively, proudly litters
[6:46:04] <SnaKemuho> issa baby boss
[6:46:05] <Khorneflakes_> I wish I didn't need to drive to work Feelsbadman
[6:46:06] <%MelBrooksKA> @JJCheeker Montreals is one of the best
[6:46:06] <%Reizie_Etherealm> Just put some shinto paper charms on Sekiro man and say that we're exorcising the land of all evil and I would buy it
[6:46:07] <ShichiNoBushi> If you were forced to live somewhere else, would you get a license and car?
[6:46:08] <+mobius_won> living in the south if you don't have a car you're very fucked
[6:46:09] <kiryuva> pro tip of not driving: never having to pay car insurance or fixing your car
[6:46:13] <reinbachthe3rd> I'd imagine public transportation is probably pretty solid in Montreal, too.
[6:46:15] <%Kangumosa> is that a mini boss: no pat, it's just you
[6:46:15] <%rdark_ksu> Fry- "Oh nobody ever drove. The traffic was always terrible"
[6:46:23] <Dakuu75> better than the US I'm sure. our ppublic transport sucks a fat dick
[6:46:24] <%ScreamingMeat> Montreal where Rush Hour is EVERY Hour
[6:46:28] <Shishi1205> Banish
[6:46:29] <%DirtyGaijin> Id like to not need a car
[6:46:30] <%Typhaeon> That guy has a door
[6:46:32] <%JJCheeker> I was in London and their's is pretty decent
[6:46:32] <OkamiDude15> soon there will be no cars in montreal only pedestrians walking and public transport

[6:46:43] <SnaKemuho> literally just a door
[6:46:45] <dukenux> all those extra costs that come with a car actually scare me off owning one

[6:47:13] <boostergoldz> lmao
[6:47:14] <%Reizie_Etherealm> Nudging you with that wooden board did a ton of damage, what's up with that
[6:47:15] <%XzileGaming> When the Halls WUG back
[6:47:15] <Zaka51> did he beat you to death with a giant board with nailes hammered in it
[6:47:16] <blackbookalpha> divine fan blocked by wood
[6:47:17] <Bouldus> the greatest weapon of all, a table
[6:47:17] <albinobigfoot1> looks like the door man deleted you
[6:47:17] <dukenux> i get by without driving anywhere so it feels like it's not worth it
[6:47:19] <Ghostars> Dark Souls: Shields are good, Bloodborne: shields are bad, Seriko: Shields are OP
[6:47:20] <%Typhaeon> He went around the door!
[6:47:21] <Darren716> Public transit is for nerds
[6:47:23] <OkamiDude15> nothing on earth can make it fall
[6:47:24] <%MagickBurritoh> I lived bitch
[6:47:26] <%doc_ock_rokc> Ninjas do it from behind
[6:47:28] <Pajex_> cute face on that one
[6:47:36] <OrochiSheewa> the gods didn't want that one LUL
[6:47:38] <LegendaryDorkKnight> when you have a license shit just gets easier
[6:47:43] <%Gogogolem> well you see pat when a man loves a potatoe.
[6:47:44] <T_sarr> @MagickBurritoh that cracks me up everytime
[6:47:53] <%Niney_Who> Pat Vs Giant Money: Haha first try
[6:47:53] <honmaheadbutt> These monks found Jesus but betrayed Buddha
[6:47:56] <%Niney_Who> Pat Vs Door: OH NO
[6:47:59] <Dehlome> @AngriestPat what do you use for ID if you dont drive?
[6:48:11] <%DirtyGaijin> Passport or something maybe
[6:48:13] <%Valentinius_Anodyne> That's what you get for turning your backs on Buddha
[6:48:13] <Zaka51> you can just get a government ID card
[6:48:16] <Ravenian96> Buddha go down
[6:48:16] <%Svanyr> If like ontario, Health card
[6:48:20] <LegendaryDorkKnight> health card probs
[6:48:20] <nzolozabal> So I had a crazy idea. Work with me on this; The Pillar Men for MK11. How does that sound?
[6:48:22] <Shortnamer> @Dehlome ID cards lol
[6:48:23] <dukenux> Buddha wept
[6:48:24] <%Gogogolem> Nah buddahs pretty chill he'd be like whatever
[6:48:24] <+mobius_won> ID cards exist
[6:48:25] <Zaka51> Generic ID cards exist
[6:48:25] <Doodle_Taco> He hates it
[6:48:31] <dmac63> ID cards duh lol
[6:48:33] <%Svanyr> Atleast for LCBO esque ID requirements
[6:48:34] <dukenux> ID cards are obligatory here
[6:48:36] <+smevvster> Oh Pat's gonna love the next pair of enemies up there
[6:48:38] <+AlwaysHuffer> He loves it
[6:48:38] <Coffee_JD> Buddha is not into all this centipede bullshit
[6:48:39] <BunnyEmperor> Its buddha's evil twin brother buttha
[6:48:40] <+Qsmash_> that was the slowest bomb ever
[6:48:41] <+matrixManipulator> Enemy Of Buddha
[6:48:42] <%ScreamingMeat> Buddah is sad. He's not made. Just very disappointed
[6:48:45] <SnaKemuho> Buddha's probably disappointed but he won't show it
[6:48:45] <Dehlome> Id card sounds much lamer than a drivers license
[6:48:48] <OrochiSheewa> @nzolozabal fuck yeah
[6:48:49] <%Typhaeon> Gnarly, yet not radical, nor bodacious
[6:48:51] <%ScreamingMeat> *mad

[7:30:21] <MonocleCoyote> @AngriestPat it was not a loop there was a grapple point there you missed
[7:30:23] <Tophat12> So yeah, from the item descriptions, basically the monks became obsessed with immortality and made drugs to fund research on it
[7:30:28] <%DirtyGaijin> poor guy only wanted to help
[7:30:28] <+smevvster> @AngriestPat I don't know if you're aware, but when you "confront" a memory to increase your Attack Power, you get unique lore
[7:30:32] <Hydrapissed> Kill that fooker
[7:30:35] <Shishi1205> Are you getting powered up by remebering the bullshit they made you gothrough

[8:06:58] <%trnzero> @aishman someone told him that a choice would completely change the outcome of the game, he just guessed this was it

[8:09:36] <%Fruitywhompus> thats rough brother
[8:09:37] <kiryuva> @AngriestPat how did you conclude Owl stabbed Sekiro? am i just a big dumb?
[8:09:38] <%PlainSimpleTailor> FromSoft is really stretching their credibility of world building with all of this, giant npcs, glasses monkeys, ogres and fantasy regen diseases. Is this Feudal Japan in the same way that Hero was Warring States China?
[8:09:41] <@Moobot> Whoa I don't even shout that much! (@Nyckelus) (warning)
[8:09:41] <sonofthedeepsouth> LUL

[8:09:48] <+matrixManipulator> @arfsm95 No, he says 1 as in Rule 1 of the Code
[8:09:48] <%laserbeaming> That's fucking rough
[8:09:52] <+WaywardSera> biggest of oof
[8:09:55] <necrocannibal2> fuck I hate backtracking
[8:09:57] <%StewTheGreat> does the secret passage going to kuro's room work?
[8:09:58] <necrocannibal2> From should stop doing that
[8:09:58] <MonocleCoyote> @AngriestPat you can enter the castle before the fight from the other entrances
[8:10:01] <Saltmeisterr> just rush it
[8:10:03] <kiryuva> oh! okie dokie.
[8:10:07] <Ner234> There must be a new Idol
[8:10:09] <%mastertwin2> It was also a MASSIVE sword
[8:10:12] <waifoong98> sounds reasonable
[8:10:15] <Restainly> There is also 5 mini boss in that building alone
[8:10:27] <+PrimordialDonut> All the idols are in the same spot you just need to reactivate them
[8:10:36] <stabbityrabbit> @AngriestPat Huh, I would've figured it was the GIANT FUCKING SWORD that only Owl wields.
[8:10:40] <blackbookalpha> sword footsies your dad's back problems away
[8:10:42] <+mrshazboto> Can't just run past these losers?
[8:10:44] <Nina96> I love this enemy
[8:10:51] <T_sarr> it couldve been the ape!
[8:10:53] <%lovebass4stuff> @AngriestPat my advise would to be run and ignore everyone
[8:11:00] <%Reizie_Etherealm> I think Pat will try the 5 mini bosses just for a closer checkpoint
[8:11:11] <%PlainSimpleTailor> I'm sure hitting a sword against another sword like that does WONDERS for maintaining its sharpness
[8:11:12] <NumberTooBig> this reminds me, how's woolie been faring since he's Royal Guard all day err'day
[8:11:15] <Hellarussian> so that was a setback and a half
[8:11:17] <arfsm95> @AngriestPat it could've been a gigantic monkey that stabed you
[8:11:24] <+emperri> lul pass
[8:11:24] <majindusto> Backtrack, Backtrack, Fucking Backtrack...Gotta do this Shit Again!

[8:40:34] <%trnzero> LET THEM FIGHT
[8:40:35] <%Zaramoth> is this game actually hard? cant ever tell with pat because theres some easy games he sucks at and hard ones he trivializes
[8:40:42] <+gwyndolinisbestwaifu> LET THEM FIGHT
[8:40:42] <%yoshkosh20> let'em fight. kill the survivor
[8:40:48] <%trnzero> STOP
[8:40:54] <waifoong98> Armored Core shenanigans here LUL
[8:40:56] <LegendaryDorkKnight> problem will literally solve itself
[8:40:57] <+taerisx> FUCK EM UP PAT
[8:40:57] <Animedingo> This is anime AF
[8:41:00] <blackbookalpha> @valriot just don't buy groceries
[8:41:01] <iggycokedust> While you were looking for your wife James I studied the blade
[8:41:02] <+cahv123> Should have just let them fight then taken down the weakened one.
[8:41:02] <KitsuneManami> This game looks Needlessly hard
[8:41:08] <Xelhesia> this is fucking hilarious
[8:41:20] <LegendaryDorkKnight> @kitsunemanami something wrong with a hard game?
[8:41:30] <CoryFTWs> these combos flow so nicely
[8:41:32] <+Thunder_Poo> This looks like reverse dark souls
[8:41:37] <blackbookalpha> should've placed bets
[8:41:38] <+emperri> rip
[8:41:39] <necrocannibal2> test your new move
[8:41:40] <+DeaconBluesClues> @KitsuneManami you were in woolies stream
[8:41:40] <waifoong98> LUL Grab
[8:41:43] <+HeadsHeldHigh> DUNK
[8:41:44] <Hellarussian> you goofed it
[8:41:45] <%kenpachi9211> DEATH COUNT 188
[8:41:48] <LegendaryDorkKnight> slam jam
[8:41:50] <KitsuneManami> @LegendaryDorkKnight Nope, but this one is rediculous compared
[8:42:00] <Nyckelus> @kitsunemanami Nah, it’s all about timing now. Deflections rule almost everything and jumping/Mikiri counters the rest.
[8:42:03] <Nina96> why?
[8:42:05] <LegendaryDorkKnight> @kitsunemanami how so?
[8:42:10] <thetyrantcbass> Oops! All Uchigatanas
[8:42:15] <%aishman> @AngriestPat I'm so happy that after 10 years, we finally got a game of this type with a fucking story.
[8:42:20] <+dougrayman> this game feels so much not like dark souls that i thinks is scrwing with us
[8:42:21] <+gwyndolinisbestwaifu> it's really more like reverse blooborne, imo; block, don't dodge instead of dodge, don't block
[8:42:23] <+taerisx> Can't wait to get that Red Blade
[8:42:23] <CoryFTWs> a lot of reviews said this game was easier than most souls games tho.
[8:42:26] <+matrixManipulator> Kill Owl?
[8:42:27] <$SleepyMaribo> the whole having to break every enemy's pose thing seems needlessly tedious.
[8:42:31] <KitsuneManami> first 5% in the game and you fight things that 2 shot you and 5 adds
[8:42:32] <KishinGrek> Any tenchu references found yet?
[8:42:41] <+dougrayman> tengu? demon crow?
[8:42:42] <%laserbeaming> Sekiro is actually a Rhythm game
[8:42:46] <Vermillion129> Monkeys ded
[8:42:50] <Kirby_Sauce> cheer500 I've been sitting here, and I've realized something. Pat plays rather defensively (until he gets too greedy). Woolie plays aggressively, but gets scared and backs off when he should press forward. The other thing is that they really named this game the wrong thing. They should have names it chumbawumba: tub Thumping. Why? Cause I GET KNOCKED DOWN. But I get up again. And they're never gonna keep me down.
[8:43:00] <Seanster5130> hows the PC port so far any noticeable problems?
[8:43:01] <+emperri> rip
[8:43:01] <LegendaryDorkKnight> @kitsunemanami played dark souls before?
[8:43:01] <+cobrafan79> How far is pat?

[8:43:33] <%DirtyGaijin> apatCrazyhand apatCrazyhead

[8:44:22] <%Reizie_Etherealm> Jon I require my lasaga
[8:44:27] <Aussie_Manny> Is he one-armed???

[8:44:29] <zebult> @chaumiester they've all had one arm
[8:44:30] <Vermillion129> Also spear bearer but use katana
[8:44:35] <Aussie_Manny> BAIKEN'S COUSIN?!
[8:44:35] <stabbityrabbit> Watch this guy not even have a spear.
[8:44:35] <KishinGrek> Was it a drop or found item?
[8:44:36] <@Moobot> Whoa I don't even shout that much! (@Jpdodds)
[8:44:39] <necrocannibal2> why is everyone 8 foot tall
[8:44:43] <%Ion_Laser> @Aussie_Manny he has the other arm in a sling
[8:44:44] <%yoshkosh20> he hides the spear in his pants.
[8:44:44] <necrocannibal2> I hate that about Souls games
[8:44:45] <Ah_Ping> they use their second arms to do their ninja art things
[8:44:45] <KitsuneManami> @LegendaryDorkKnight I work a full time job, Im not a streamer hwo can play all the time
[8:44:51] <zebult> every single one of the new enemies except the red hat has had one arm
[8:44:53] <+sumire_gelato> is he exploring the castle?
[8:44:54] <+WorldsBestPanda> Why doesn't pat use the gourd before he gets poisoned...?
[8:44:54] <Nina96> @Aussie_Manny no
[8:44:58] <%MelBrooksKA> @Vermillion129 probably hard to bear a spear with one arm
[8:44:59] <Paperware> thought his name was lone shadow lasagna for a sec
[8:45:03] <LegendaryDorkKnight> @kitsunemanami on your days off?
[8:45:04] <Caidezes> They have two arms.
[8:45:04] <%torontototoro> @necrocannibal2 so MC can cut them down to size
[8:45:07] <KitsuneManami> i dont get paid to play a game
[8:45:08] <CoryFTWs> why is everyone 8 foot tall? because that's how japanese would like to see themselves. lmao
[8:45:09] <%SirTripsalot> But he has two arms, that's what he poisons you with
[8:45:13] <$valriot> everyones dummy thicc, how can they even BE ninjas
[8:45:15] <+Magnetoplasmadynamic> That guy's arm in the cloak is so sick looking.
[8:45:16] <$hatesdps> that kick is super cool
[8:45:16] <KitsuneManami> I have better things to do than struggle all day on 1 boss
[8:45:20] <LegendaryDorkKnight> @kitsunemanami u mad bro?
[8:45:21] <Pykeball> Important enemies are taller than your character so you can see them and react better.
[8:45:23] <Aussie_Manny> It wasn't ME! It was the one-armed man!
[8:45:23] <Maleicus> i cant stop seeing lasagna
[8:45:24] <Animedingo> who is this bruce lee mofo
[8:45:25] <%lovebass4stuff> i have been here sense 4:00 wtf
[8:45:28] <TigerClaws12> are we in hard mode?
[8:45:32] <KitsuneManami> @LegendaryDorkKnight LOL here we go with the toxic talk
[8:45:38] <Nyckelus> The loop!
[8:45:43] <Aussie_Manny> NAISUUUUUU
[8:45:44] <+chaumiester> Is the main character the most malnourished dude in Japan? Why is everyone else like 8-9 feet tall
[8:45:45] <%MelBrooksKA> @TigerClaws12 I think there are no modes
[8:45:49] <%ScreamingMeat> All these people are WAY to tall to ever be trained as Shinobi. They actually had a strict weight and height limit
[8:45:49] <LegendaryDorkKnight> @kitsunemanami I'll stop if you do
[8:45:51] <%kenpachi9211> DEATH COUNT 190
[8:45:57] <KishinGrek> Fuck naruto, this is some real ninja shit
[8:45:57] <+Das_Prints> @necrocannibal2 I’d imagine for gameplay purposes it makes the big threats stick out more and easier to read what they are doing. Aesthetics wise it just makes them look more intimidating. Lore wise, I have no clue. Wolf is just Little Mac in this land of giants.
[8:45:59] <Aussie_Manny> BigPhish
[8:46:01] <%yoshkosh20> the sword clashing is so satisfying.
[8:46:05] <LegendaryDorkKnight> @kitsunemanami clergy you have the time to watch this?
[8:46:05] <%Reizie_Etherealm> Japan is retroactively making themselves look a 100 times cooler than they actually were in real life history by making sick video game character designs
[8:46:08] <+DeaconBluesClues> @ScreamingMeat something something ginger ninja
[8:46:18] <Hellarussian> LOS LUL
[8:46:19] <theonlyxception> clergy LUL
[8:46:19] <+HeadsHeldHigh> The block and deflect volley is really satisfying
[8:46:19] <KitsuneManami> @LegendaryDorkKnight all you had to say was "Its hard shit, dont let it get to you, "
[8:46:24] <Xelhesia> lol
[8:46:27] <%Ion_Laser> @yoshkosh20 I'm getting this game for the sword clashing alone
[8:46:35] <etalmeta> @chaumiester if you want an actual answer, bigger enemies vs a smaller player make it easier to see what the enemy is doing
[8:46:36] <KitsuneManami> I have the time because im in bed now
[8:46:37] <Monkeyweed21> Throw ash in his face
[8:46:39] <zebult> where are you going
[8:46:44] <+djbsully> He killed him, thats longsword you can fight him under the resviour, PAT DODGE TO HIS ARMLESS SIDE EVERYTIME!!!!
[8:46:45] <+HeadsHeldHigh> ded
[8:46:45] <TheMeromex> @AngriestPat you can stealth him to get a bar out if you go from the side

[9:01:11] <%ArcanumMBD> He does a Mikiri Counter on the thrust, which maxed out Pat's Posture, which let him do a Mortal Blow
[9:01:13] <%Ion_Laser> Why, BOI
[9:01:15] <%yoshkosh20> quite
[9:01:22] <%ArcanumMBD> Dude is operating under the same rules as you
[9:01:45] <%DirtyGaijin> LUL love the little throw he has
[9:01:46] <+Jonny_Lam> Can’t even get mad at that
[9:01:48] <%Reizie_Etherealm> What's that debuff?
[9:01:49] <DrSpatula> Poison him?
[9:01:49] <%StEmlosWater> lloyds talisman?
[9:01:56] <LegendaryDorkKnight> I just realized he has the murakumo
[9:01:58] <Ner234> Can't usee items
[9:01:59] <TigerClaws12> @Reizie_Etherealm prevents item use
[9:01:59] <+hoenhime344> the debuff dosent let him heal
[9:02:00] <%trnzero> lloyds
[9:02:01] <%yoshkosh20> yeah. if you were ten feet tall and stronger than an elephant with a grudge.
[9:02:01] <+HeadsHeldHigh> Lol why does he toss the talismans like a skee ball

[9:02:33] <%ArcanumMBD> @AngriestPat Your posture/stamina recovers faster if you hold guard (also if you have higher hp)
[9:02:34] <+HeadsHeldHigh> But uh he's your daddy...? I guess?
[9:02:36] <DrSpatula> Poison? anyone?
[9:02:53] <%yoshkosh20> @HeadsHeldHigh STAHP
[9:02:59] <%ArcanumMBD> @AngriestPat Your posture/stamina recovers faster if you hold guard (also affected by your current hp)

[9:03:13] <Flare3500> Jesus that firecrackers is awesome
[9:03:21] <%laserbeaming> It's just before the end game zone I think
[9:03:24] <LegendaryDorkKnight> yeah I thought it was the murakumo
[9:03:24] <+Das_Prints> This is all part of Wolf’s late stage rebellious teen phase, except he’s in his 30’s or something.
[9:03:28] <CopperTucker> Pat streams are so nice. I had a long-ass day and it's nice to chill and unwind.
[9:03:30] <+hoenhime344> @ScreamingMeat it prevents him from useing his healing
[9:03:31] <%StEmlosWater> @ScreamingMeat Smoke bomb disables your items
[9:03:32] <%torontototoro> how many times must purple sentry man suffer?
[9:03:33] <%ArcanumMBD> @ScreamingMeat stops Pat from healing
[9:03:42] <Nina96> @AngriestPat what ever happend to lightning guy?
[9:03:44] <%yoshkosh20> Wolf's a late bloomer
[9:03:45] <%MattDemers> Hm, maybe this is the Ornstein/Smough of the game

[9:04:28] <%laserbeaming> From Software bosses tend to have rare moves that they don't use a lot. Maybe you just got lucky

[9:08:12] <$SGrim> If you kill him, are you Great Shinobi - Wolf? SeemsGood
[9:08:14] <VERDAXY> cheese it
[9:08:15] <LegendaryDorkKnight> way to go moomoo
[9:08:19] <%ScreamingMeat> @Jpdodds I have yet to see Gaijin scream about anything other than maybe for comedic purposes. And he did use to live in Japan teaching english and studied a bunch about Japanese mythology and history. Just because he's not Japanese doesn't mean he can't critique on historical inaccuracies. And he's graded more Ninjas as good ones than bad, especially ones from Japanese games. What's your issue with GaijinGoomba?
[9:08:19] <+hoenhime344> omg...when ever pat does those thrusts i shit myself a little
[9:08:21] <waifoong98> so the fight is indeed health chipping eh
[9:08:22] <%Reizie_Etherealm> The music in this game leaves a lot to be desired tbh, but I think that's for the better. I feel it'd be bad if the music is too good
[9:08:24] <dickbuttwoman> Fight'him lame like a dark souls boss
[9:08:26] <%DirtyGaijin> is that the guy who keeps spamming racial slurs?
[9:08:26] <%MattDemers> I believe in you, Patrick
[9:08:27] <%trnzero> You know, with enough time to prepare, Owl can beat anyone

[9:08:42] <arfsm95> @angriestpat you can kill the purple guy and go buffed with the blood sword to the fight
[9:08:43] <reonome> you were close
[9:08:43] <FiftyFiveP> CLOSE
[9:08:44] <Monkeyweed21> almost beat phase 1
[9:08:44] <LegendaryDorkKnight> so close
[9:08:44] <Nina96> 1 more?
[9:08:44] <DrSpatula> Poison?
[9:08:46] <%lovebass4stuff> take a break then fight it
[9:08:46] <%flagi64> you got this man

[9:08:53] <%Fenrirlives> @AngriestPat use the blood blade buff off purple guy?
[9:08:57] <LegendaryDorkKnight> you'll get him now
[9:08:58] <%JD_Lars> I can hear Pat’s heart from here
[9:08:58] <Darthwaffler> You got this Paddy.
[9:08:59] <+mercilust> he doesnt do sweeps or big pokes does he?
[9:09:04] <+hoenhime344> no need to use confettie.
[9:09:05] <zebult> nairo1more nairo1more nairo1more
[9:09:05] <+Das_Prints> The attempt to correct after dodging into the goo got him. Good run though that loop might be pretty good.
[9:09:09] <TigerClaws12> also confettis are rare, why waste it on owl
[9:09:09] <%aishman> But it will make a difference
[9:09:10] <+Punchasaur> gaijin goomba is fucking annoying
[9:09:10] <FiftyFiveP> maybe use some more tools
[9:09:11] <Restainly> U know he has to beat this boss now
[9:09:19] <cacophanes> just parry him Kappa Kappa
[9:09:22] <%ArcanumMBD> Not confetti, the blood blade buff ninjutsu. Different buff
[9:09:24] <%JJCheeker> Is this the last fight?

[9:09:26] <LegendaryDorkKnight> we going all the way bois
[9:09:33] <Nina96> y dont u hit him before talking?
[9:09:33] <Dragon_Batman> Does he have unblockables?

[9:09:40] <%Fenrirlives> HoO BOy PAT YOU SAVAGE
[9:09:43] <+stagemage> he trained you he knows not to throw out counterables
[9:09:45] <+hoenhime344> do NOT thrust on him
[9:09:52] <dan_g_v> But Dad! You died in a fire in my memory of a bell in a temple in the past! D=

[9:10:27] <%InkblotBlues> @MizBazz It is the same VA as Reinhardt.
[9:10:29] <cacophanes> @MizBazz it's reinhardt and ardyn aka Darin Fuckin Paul
[9:10:32] <+jkfd> why the switch up. i thought he head learned how to beat owl guy during last attempt.
[9:10:35] <kiryuva> or does it stagger them?

[9:11:39] <%kenpachi9211> DEATH COUNT 202
[9:11:40] <%trnzero> OOOOOOF
[9:11:40] <smallboops> welp thats 1
[9:11:41] <cacophanes> you can defeat Japanese Gwyn, Pat
[9:11:41] <LegendaryDorkKnight> sugoi desu
[9:11:44] <%Ion_Laser> GODDAMN
[9:11:44] <+Zenthreg> this is like 75%
[9:11:44] <reonome> get owned punk
[9:11:45] <%laserbeaming> He can use deathblows too!
[9:11:45] <+Lavanio> Pog
[9:11:46] <%yoshkosh20> his foot is almost larger than your torso
[9:11:47] <%ScreamingMeat> @Jpdodds No seriously what is your problem with gaijinGoomba. Everytime I've mentioned him you make a snide comment about him
[9:11:48] <+hoenhime344> @smallboops dont count on it...he never dashes forward. cant abuse the bomb if hes not near it
[9:11:48] <dan_g_v> well, this looks pretty end of game, @roflwaffleauthoritah
[9:11:51] <Darthwaffler> sick
[9:11:58] <+ZobRombi> ding dong
[9:12:08] <Vermillion129> Owl can also use Mikiri counter if you try stabbing him like a moron
[9:12:10] <+Zenthreg> 75-80% i wanna say
[9:12:12] <%ArcanumMBD> @roflwaffleauthoritah I'd say he's about 75-80%
[9:12:17] <+SomeOtherNeb> lmao
[9:12:18] <+tygermom> man at the final boss and i have to say the last few hours of the game are a little bland
[9:12:18] <%zZGrimreaperZz> zZGrimreaperZz subscribed with Twitch Prime. They've subscribed for 3 months! 
[9:12:18] <Ignorableartist> @dodge into when he throws the little bomb to get some free hits
[9:12:19] <dan_g_v> so, everybody already dead of dragonrot, right?
[9:12:19] <Vermillion129> See
[9:12:19] <smallboops> hahaha
[9:12:19] <LegendaryDorkKnight> yeyeyeyey
[9:12:21] <Vermillion129> Mikiri
[9:12:22] <%trnzero> why pat
[9:12:22] <%StEmlosWater> @ScreamingMeat I find him to be incredibly condescending, and for the life of me I can;t understand why he woujld choose that voice filter. I also speak Japanese, very soon will have my history degree, if all continues to go well, and I have never felt the need to try and dissuade people from having their fun, deespite having the tools to be just as pedantic. I find the willingness to intentionally try and detract from people's enjoyment distasteful. Am I being a hypocrite for complaining about
[9:12:23] <%ArcanumMBD> Pat stop thrusting your Dad
[9:12:23] <kiryuva> i knew his voice is familiar! Owl is voiced by Darin de Paul!
[9:12:24] <$SleepyMaribo> now that seems straight up cheap
[9:12:25] <Xelhesia> lol
[9:12:26] <%finnlad00> WOWIE
[9:12:27] <Caidezes> why
[9:12:29] <+luketrapwalker> yikes
[9:12:30] <+WorldsBestPanda> NEVER, Pat said. NEVER.
[9:12:32] <%Tearonex> NEVER do thurst
[9:12:32] <Aussie_Manny> COUNTERRRRRRRRRR
[9:12:39] <+hoenhime344> stop thrusting
[9:12:40] <Vermillion129> just right when I said he can Mikiri Pat just demonstate it
[9:12:42] <+hoenhime344> your papa
[9:12:48] <dan_g_v> no thrust, just grind and hump
[9:12:50] <smallboops> drop your shield @AngriestPat
[9:13:00] <+hoenhime344> @smallboops BWAHAHAHHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHA
[9:13:08] <LegendaryDorkKnight> this is uncomfortable
[9:13:10] <+fatal_penguin_> Patrick, try to remember some of the basics of Ninjitsu
[9:13:14] <+luketrapwalker> that smoke was awesome
[9:13:18] <%trnzero> he always does that after smoke bomb it seems
[9:13:20] <Darthwaffler> sbfpDattebayo
[9:13:24] <%torontototoro> have you tried embering up to reduce your insight?
[9:13:26] <%ArcanumMBD> @smallboops actually dropping your shield is not great advice. Holding your guard up speeds up posture recovery in this game
[9:13:27] <%Tunnelcakesrule> Become the Big Shinobi
[9:13:29] <dan_g_v> So, Woolie already beat Pat, right? :3
[9:13:32] <LegendaryDorkKnight> u got this
[9:13:38] <waifoong98> scumbag LUL
[9:13:51] <%Fenrirlives> get those shuriken out my mans
[9:13:51] <%MattDemers> Does he still have his ressurection?
[9:13:51] <+hoenhime344> All pat needs to do is go super saiyain...o wait....no hair
[9:13:52] <%thefakeh> did he just fully reset is posture
[9:14:03] <%RubberFistFight> @Jpdodds what was that wall of text all about o_O
[9:14:10] <Darthwaffler> @dan_g_v Woolies on Lady Butterfly.
[9:14:11] <%Tearonex> Look at this anime fight
[9:14:12] <smallboops> it was literally a joke...
[9:14:23] <%finnlad00> not a good angle
[9:14:24] <%kenpachi9211> DEATH COUNT 203
[9:14:24] <Restainly> Papa no
[9:14:25] <LegendaryDorkKnight> damn it
[9:14:27] <+tygermom> don't be afraid to go agro on this guy
[9:14:28] <dan_g_v> you are in the dead land
[9:14:34] <%MattDemers> Great work, fromsoft camera
[9:14:34] <$SGrim> Where am I? Dead!
[9:14:35] <Aussie_Manny> Ewwwww! D:
[9:14:37] <+TheArkayngel> Wait how does Pat have so much health... I'm literally banging my head against this same boat but I have like half that lifebar
[9:14:40] <%laserbeaming> This game needs the For Honor look through walls tech
[9:14:41] <dan_g_v> you're in Zombieland saga
[9:14:41] <%trnzero> but that was new dialogue...
[9:14:50] <Vermillion129> oof
[9:14:51] <%Tunnelcakesrule> that is an awesome smoke bomb
[9:14:52] <%kenpachi9211> DEATH COUNT 204
[9:14:53] <Aussie_Manny> ur ded
[9:14:53] <%lovebass4stuff> fuck me
[9:14:58] <LegendaryDorkKnight> choke
[9:14:59] <mayorrev> BibleThump
[9:15:00] <%StEmlosWater> @RubberFistFight Someone asked me why I don't like GaijinGoomba, so I told him
[9:15:01] <FiftyFiveP> patience
[9:15:06] <LixFury> kill all minibosses
[9:15:15] <%Ion_Laser> *COUGH*
[9:15:16] <dan_g_v> yeah, dragonrot!
[9:15:17] <blackjackskellington> he has no counterable moves
[9:15:17] <%TheShal> Easy Mode Unlocked
[9:15:22] <$SleepyMaribo> is it true dragon rot kills npc's eventually?
[9:15:24] <MrGarettLefebvre> Is he using any of his arms abilities
[9:15:25] <theonlyxception> he has 7 necklaces thats how
[9:15:28] <%Fenrirlives> @AngriestPat what arm do you think is best for Owl?
[9:15:28] <$SGrim> @AngriestPat just ignore the effects of your exhaustion and DO BETTER SwiftRage
[9:15:35] <%ArcanumMBD> @TheArkayngel named minibosses give a prayer bead. Also explore, some prayer beads are hidden in the world. There are incomplete prayer bead guides out there
[9:15:40] <%laserbeaming> He's not using arms at all!
[9:15:41] <LegendaryDorkKnight> shit gaijingoomba is still around
[9:15:42] <TigerClaws12> @AngriestPat did you ring the hard mode bell?
[9:15:44] <dan_g_v> time to refill the redbull?
[9:15:45] <%torontototoro> OWL I've come to bargain
[9:15:47] <Dragon_Batman> No kidding
[9:15:50] <+hoenhime344> @ArcanumMBD a common missconception. if you hold your gaurd and get his all the posture you recover will be for not. the best thing to do is stand firm and parry. if not, the speed you get with gaurd down will help you get out of range
[9:15:58] <%MelBrooksKA> Time to axe dad a question
[9:16:00] <%ScreamingMeat> @Jpdodds I don't know why you feel that way but I haven't found any of your complaints about him to be true. Never has anything Gaijin said about something have I found dissuasive towards certain properties. And in fact I have learned more about Japanese culture through him than I have anywhere else.
[9:16:01] <Aydarkzero> so whats the point of dragonrot it's just for a negative effect?
[9:16:24] <+Kurogane_Dread> how many attempts
[9:16:27] <+hoenhime344> @Aydarkzero its a death penalty
[9:16:31] <theonlyxception> does the firecracker have any effect?
[9:16:34] <dan_g_v> world tendency v2, @Aydarkzero
[9:16:38] <Nina96> cant imagine it if u LPd this game
[9:16:44] <%torontototoro> Owl daddy's hair looks grossly impractical for a ninja man
[9:16:55] <DrSpatula> Still no attempt to poison?
[9:16:56] <Ner234> @Aydarkzero I think some questlines ccan't be completed if the NPC has dragonrot
[9:17:02] <%yoshkosh20> he's so good that he sometimes uses his hair as a weapon.
[9:17:02] <LegendaryDorkKnight> aren't Ninjas supposed to be sneaky?
[9:17:06] <dan_g_v> that's where he hides all his ninja stuff, @torontototoro
[9:17:07] <Hydrapissed> yes
[9:17:10] <%kenpachi9211> @Kurogane_Dread AT LEAST 7
[9:17:15] <%ArcanumMBD> @hoenhime344 obviously you shouldn't just stand there with your guard up vs a boss, but for someone to meme out "drop your shield" is bad advice for this game since it ignores a key mechanic (which funnily enough is only told in a loading screen)
[9:17:16] <$cureneckbeard> !uptime
[9:17:16] <@Moobot> I've been playing this game for how long? Oh only 9h 17m.
[9:17:19] <+Shastafield> anyone in this thread smoke crack?
[9:17:32] <dan_g_v> only crack pairings
[9:17:33] <%Harawanagangsta> hell yea
[9:17:37] <TigerClaws12> @torontototoro his existence alone is impractical, look at the size of him LUL
[9:17:40] <%StEmlosWater> @ScreamingMeat I dunno, man. Maybe his videos have gotten better. I only know what I think, and maybe I'm wrong, but thats the way it is, eh?
[9:17:45] <DrSpatula> This ia a thread?
[9:17:48] <%kenpachi9211> DEATH COUNT 205
[9:17:50] <+hoenhime344> @LegendaryDorkKnight no ninjas are crafty, not exactly sneaky.
[9:17:54] <+fatal_penguin_> @Shastafield I live in NM, most of the ppl here smoke Crack or Meth
[9:17:55] <%Tunnelcakesrule> you'll cowards dont even smoke crack
[9:17:58] <+Thunder_Poo> man this is one tough Owl
[9:17:59] <blackbookalpha> I'd lol if the fan does something to him
[9:18:02] <LegendaryDorkKnight> I only thing I do is crack open a book ;)
[9:18:11] <Darthwaffler> His hair would actually break the human shape of his silhouette, making him harder to see.
[9:18:12] <+hoenhime344> i wonder if ash helps
[9:18:16] <$SGrim> Then stop trying to go in? 4Head
[9:18:21] <+Shastafield> @DrSpatula look at those paragraphs, this is a thread now
[9:18:26] <+gwyndolinisbestwaifu> i am surprised and proud to say i beat this guy on my second try, mostly due to my intense love for the loaded umbrella
[9:18:27] <%Reizie_Etherealm> There's not a lot of openings and where there is then it's only for like a second
[9:18:28] <%torontototoro> @TigerClaws12 Long hair that hits the ground is where I draw the line on hulking, giant sword using shinobi daddy
[9:18:31] <%StEmlosWater> @blackbookalpha Send Owl to illusory hall and let HIM do the monkey puzzle
[9:18:35] <%yoshkosh20> also use it as a cloak in snowy settings. hill blend right into the snow
[9:18:40] <%yoshkosh20> he'll
[9:18:48] <cacophanes> can you imagine if Owl threw himself off the balcony with that backflip and that fight just ended there?
[9:18:52] <blackbookalpha> @Jpdodds hahahaha damn
[9:18:54] <Midnight188> this is the learn to parry boss innit
[9:18:57] <%Zaramoth> Woolie cosplay of Owl when tho

[9:19:00] <%kenpachi9211> DEATH COUNT 206
[9:19:00] <dan_g_v> really, he does ninja job as a gigolo, seducing women with his DILF bod
[9:19:03] <+WorldsBestPanda> You're learning Pat. You're learning.
[9:19:03] <@Moobot> Whoa I don't even shout that much! (@kuzokai) (warning)
[9:19:04] <%torontototoro> Maybe he uses that hair like a rope, weebo rapunzel style
[9:19:06] <LegendaryDorkKnight> calm it down
[9:19:08] <FiftyFiveP> take a break pat
[9:19:11] <Clyderso> dont sleep monkaS You can do it!
[9:19:13] <+hoenhime344> all bosses are learn to parry
[9:19:14] <%doc_ock_rokc> maybe fire?
[9:19:15] <%Fenrirlives> Woolie Cosplaying Owl would be hype as fuck
[9:19:18] <Monkeyweed21> what do the snake hearts do?
[9:19:21] <%trnzero> LUL
[9:19:23] <blackbookalpha> send your old man to do Monkey Puzzles
[9:19:24] <DrSpatula> @AngriestPat Poison?
[9:19:25] <blackjackskellington> do big overheads
[9:19:27] <$Tarcanist_> redbull for focus
[9:19:27] <%ScreamingMeat> @Jpdodds I guess. I dunno how long ago you stopped watching his stuff but he stopped using the Goomba Ninja as his avatar a long time ago and is now just his mascot that kinda co-hosts his videos with him.
[9:19:28] <MonocleCoyote> @AngriestPat how many necklaces do you have?
[9:19:29] <dan_g_v> so, Pat as Wolf?
[9:19:30] <%Ion_Laser> apatHoldon

[9:21:20] <+matrixManipulator> @dan_g_v his original language is motivation, but he rarely uses it
[9:21:21] <blackbookalpha> cheese and do backstab footsies
[9:21:24] <$SGrim> @AngriestPat have you tried sneak attacking him before talking? SeemsGood
[9:21:25] <%ScreamingMeat> You can't take a swing at him before you talk to Owl?
[9:21:28] <+hoenhime344> he should probs use some sugar on him
[9:21:31] <LixFury> Fire cracker is super good @AngriestPat
[9:21:33] <LegendaryDorkKnight> block hit block hit
[9:21:37] <dan_g_v> huh, that makes sense @matrixManipulator

[9:21:40] <@Moobot> I've been playing this game for how long? Oh only 9h 21m.
[9:21:51] <dan_g_v> so, Owl and Wolf as DLC character in SamShow?
[9:21:57] <%MagickBurritoh> 9 hour stream
[9:22:07] <+hoenhime344> was paige for any of this stream?
[9:22:08] <%grimpo96> First time taking a look at Sekiro, why does he have an axe on his elbow?
[9:22:14] <SundarkSoldier> jetstream sam dlc for sekiro
[9:22:15] <+Punchasaur> @screamingmeat that was condescending as fuck. no wonder you like gaijin goomba
[9:22:20] <Lord_of_all_Edges> @AngriestPat Do exactly what you've been doing, but slightly better by doing it more.
[9:22:23] <%Reizie_Etherealm> That side step dodge will always be my favorite, looks so cool
[9:22:26] <%torontototoro> His hair is still super distracting me. Feels like he should swing it around to hit you
[9:22:28] <%MagickBurritoh> didn't kill you though
[9:22:28] <dan_g_v> where else is he going to put his mechanical axe, @grimpo96 ?
[9:22:37] <Darthwaffler> Prosthetic arm
[9:22:43] <LegendaryDorkKnight> you're doing much better this time Pat
[9:22:46] <%Zaramoth> is there a reason pat doesnt go in on him when he gingerly tosses the green gasball
[9:22:46] <dan_g_v> how else is he going to crush shields?
[9:22:47] <Seanster5130> his death style
[9:22:48] <Ner234> Is he the first to actually do a deathbblow
[9:22:49] <%kenpachi9211> DEATH COUNT 207
[9:22:50] <etalmeta> @torontototoro a hit in one of his combos does that
[9:22:52] <LegendaryDorkKnight> jinks
[9:22:53] <%DirtyGaijin> so i guess the fact he has streamed this for 9 hours answers peoples question if he is enjoying the game
[9:22:56] <%grimpo96> @dan_g_v I dunno, his pelvic region?
[9:23:06] <%senfood> Real talk, Pat is very good at these games. I saw those Guardian Ape fights. Those were damn good.
[9:23:08] <DrSpatula> Try ANY items maybe?
[9:23:08] <%MagickBurritoh> whoah
[9:23:09] <dan_g_v> 9 hours TODAY
[9:23:11] <Dragon_Batman> @grimpo96 You can find different items or tools to attach to your prostetic arm

[9:23:32] <+WorldsBestPanda> BIG mistake
[9:23:32] <nobknee> It's weird, all the footage I saw of Sekiro before released had Japanese spoken. Now with English, it hits the brain weird.
[9:23:34] <LegendaryDorkKnight> what cheeky blighter
[9:23:35] <cacophanes> that's the run I can feel it in me loins
[9:23:37] <coldnoid> phase twooooo

[9:24:56] <Xelhesia> Mist raven should do well here right?
[9:24:56] <%Fenrirlives> @AngriestPat if you're not gonna use extra tools, just punish the Loyd bomb
[9:24:58] <%Ion_Laser> *COUGH*
[9:25:04] <DrSpatula> Firecrackers, poison, something...
[9:25:06] <%StEmlosWater> @nobknee Has a great cast

[9:25:10] <%Zaramoth> Pat why dont you punish him when he tosses the green bomb thing
[9:25:11] <$SGrim> @AngriestPat you learned some good shit there. SeemsGood Try backstabs though. SeemsGood
[9:25:12] <%ArcanumMBD> @Hydrapissed the Mortal Blade kills the one who draws it. Getting cut by it won't insta kill you
[9:25:12] <+hoenhime344> DONT listen to JPdodds you are a machinen NOTHING WILL STOP YOUR VICTORY
[9:25:21] <Hydrapissed> @ArcanumMBD ah okay
[9:25:23] <+gwyndolinisbestwaifu> i would recommend loaded umbrella then followup when he does the 1-2 shuriken overhead attack instead of just dodging out of the way
[9:25:24] <arfsm95> @angriestpat use more of your prosthetic
[9:25:24] <%DirtyGaijin> I think the english vo is pretty good
[9:25:32] <%Reizie_Etherealm> That sucks
[9:25:32] <%ScreamingMeat> That's dumb
[9:25:35] <%StEmlosWater> @nobknee Including Charles Smith, Reinhardt, and 2B

[9:25:51] <$hatesdps> dont sweat it man, you seem to be really good at this game in particular
[9:25:54] <Hydrapissed> hey just like when ya died in the cut scene
[9:25:59] <+Zenthreg> honestly, thrust in pretty much useless in this game
[9:26:03] <nobknee> Is that Reinhardt right now? Sounds like it.
[9:26:03] <%TheHandsomeKat> Someone asked and I am curious too. What makes the pc version better?
[9:26:12] <%ScreamingMeat> Use Sugars
[9:26:14] <LegendaryDorkKnight> yeye use your arm
[9:26:16] <+JCHeavy > @nobknee yes it's rein's VA
[9:26:20] <Hydrapissed> better loads better frame rate @The_Handsome_Kat
[9:26:28] <%El_Desperad0> @The_Handsome_Kat muh framerates
[9:26:29] <PlatinumWyvern> @the_handsome_kat stable frames
[9:26:31] <%kenpachi9211> DEATH COUNT 211
[9:26:35] <nobknee> Well, that's a reason to go English.
[9:26:38] <LegendaryDorkKnight> what about PS4 pro any difference?
[9:26:39] <+hoenhime344> framerate, res, fps, controls are what ever you want tthem to be
[9:26:41] <Malkraz> @The_Handsome_Kat everything it always does better
[9:26:41] <%doc_ock_rokc> pat shirikin during bomb
[9:26:45] <+gwyndolinisbestwaifu> @The_Handsome_Kat also, likely mods at some point
[9:26:47] <%ScreamingMeat> Use the Sugar buffs
[9:26:50] <%doc_ock_rokc> feather dodge other things
[9:26:54] <curse85> when he throws the shurukins and then jumps at you and you get your free hit i would try that new move you bought
[9:26:55] <%doc_ock_rokc> Use sugar
[9:27:01] <%Fenrirlives> Fan
[9:27:02] <$SGrim> @AngriestPat but you just saw the axe do work. Why not use more axe?
[9:27:03] <nobknee> Sekiro mods let you play as Niro man. Kappa
[9:27:04] <%El_Desperad0> @LegendaryDorkKnight no
[9:27:07] <%lovebass4stuff> I have been suffering
[9:27:08] <%ScreamingMeat> Firecrackers?

[9:27:11] <%torontototoro> Why Boiven
[9:27:11] <+hoenhime344> @AngriestPat sugar my dude.....use sugar

[9:27:28] <Hydrapissed> Fire crackers why is he some kinda secret animal?
[9:27:32] <Xelhesia> @AngriestPat mist raven for easy counters
[9:27:36] <arfsm95> is anyone having a Blue flicker on the screen or Just me?
[9:27:37] <dan_g_v> it will give you wolf eyes and make you invinsiblessed
[9:27:37] <blackjackskellington> use mortal bladde until out of dolls, then x2 overhead
[9:27:40] <PlatinumWyvern> guys, pat absolutely can't use his consumables. he's gonna need them later Jebaited
[9:27:40] <+cflibbs> yo waddup pat

[9:27:49] <Ner234> Remember your buff ability Pat.
[9:27:54] <+hoenhime344> sugar, firecrackers, mortal blade...all are good options
[9:27:56] <Dragon_Batman> I don't have a blue flicker
[9:27:58] <%Tearonex> "Been a while since we did this" he says killing you not 30seconds ago
[9:28:08] <%StEmlosWater> Emma is Steph Sheh! Well I'll be...

[9:28:31] <dan_g_v> Remember that time Pat used all his ammo in the laboratory and couldn't beat Super Mr X? Tragic times

[9:28:32] <+jkfd> does pat have flowing water?
[9:28:40] <%ScreamingMeat> Firecracker and Mortal Blade combo will probably do a lot
[9:28:47] <LegendaryDorkKnight> he is subhuman
[9:28:54] <+emperri> you cannot kill him

[9:36:04] <AzureSkyKnight> I wasnt here
[9:36:05] <Hydrapissed> and sekiro ends up being captured
[9:36:11] <kiryuva> i just realized the word "owl" is in "wolf".

[9:37:50] <%MagickBurritoh> Kid should be able to wield it
[9:37:52] <%torontototoro> feels weird catching Sekiro stream for the first time so close to endgame

[9:53:55] <$SleepyMaribo> @AngriestPat you should see some of the pc forums, people are just saying get a trainer for this game.

[9:54:03] <Nina96> sounds like a melee player @AngriestPat
[9:54:04] <kiryuva> the thing with these types of games are... you have to be willing to take the challenge. don't just get a game because others play it. make sure it's something you'd enjoy.
[9:54:05] <%Valentinius_Anodyne> They return the game because they are cowards
[9:54:12] <%jiin6> Pat you're throwing a tanturum
[9:54:13] <+Ell1ot> you said i was a nerd and now you're also saying i'm a baby.
[9:54:17] <%sabertoothzombie> did Pat end up beating Owl?

[9:55:08] <+Das_Prints> @angriestpat Granted they are different types of action game but how does this stack up to DMCV if we were talking about best games of the year so far?

[9:55:25] <waifoong98> cliffy b LUL
[9:55:26] <+Das_Prints> He’s been doing that most of the back half of the stream every once in a while.
[9:55:28] <mayorrev> CLIFFY DID IT
[9:55:29] <%VanaSkiller> LUL
[9:55:34] <NumberTooBig> also he's still in chat @ohgodnoitsneuro
[9:55:37] <blackbookalpha> CliffyB still salt
[9:55:39] <%Spydurman> The difficulty of this game has actually legit turned me off from it just cause I think I have zero chance of beating it
[9:55:41] <%ThePuddingDead> cliffy b wouldnt know how to raid if he looked at his career
[9:55:42] <$SleepyMaribo> Cliffy the eternal Rival...
[9:55:43] <+Ell1ot> Pat did big stream because he wore big underwear today
[9:55:47] <kiryuva> @AngriestPat i started playing the series years ago when you would mention it in YT videos and i'm glad i took the chance. wraxuLove
[9:55:51] <zebult> @AngriestPat the thing about difficulty modes is there's really no reason not to. I used to be in the same camp of "don't touch my game", but like, just make a 'definitive' diffivulty
[9:55:54] <kiryuva> Soulsborne, that is.

[10:01:26] <SunsetJack> This is why we have new game plus.
[10:01:27] <laggy24111> pat do you feel that Sekiro feels like a souls game or more of its own thing?
[10:01:34] <%RubberFistFight> @Spydurman you're joking, right? Twitch do nothing about bot.
[10:01:36] <+tygermom> i fucked up the snake hearts quest
[10:01:38] <+tygermom> im mad
[10:01:43] <+tygermom> i worked hard to get those
[10:01:46] <%Valentinius_Anodyne> That's to be expected, doing a Fromsoft game blind
[10:01:49] <%Sir_Gawain_Lotsson> there should be an option to exclude raiders from follower only mode for a certain amount of time
[10:01:50] <321Continue> Pat is up late, bad boy
[10:02:01] <Nina96> yeah there is
[10:02:03] <%MagickBurritoh> ye
[10:02:04] <+tygermom> you have to talk to rice lady
[10:02:07] <dan_g_v> Black samurai killed, right?
[10:02:11] <+tygermom> and give kuro the rice
[10:02:12] <jman13131313> ye
[10:02:17] <%AllyBeeBoo> what time is it where Pat is?
[10:02:17] <+fatal_penguin_> Does anyone else miss the bra's on Skellmo?
[10:02:17] <jman13131313> no
[10:02:17] <+kyuubisonic> i wish
[10:02:17] <Darthwaffler> ye
[10:02:19] <%MagickBurritoh> Woolie ninja was sent to the surgeon
[10:02:19] <LegendaryDorkKnight> man so many people ask that, like just watch some gameplay you can tell immediately its it's own thing
[10:02:19] <+tygermom> i think you might still be able to do it
[10:02:20] <Nina96> probably
[10:02:21] <%Spydurman> @RubberFistFight I guess I mean more gives channels the about to handle them. Overall though bots add to view counts so not surprising
[10:02:21] <%connos_livereview> undoubtedly
[10:02:26] <$KnivesEve> pat with my limited budget should i get sekiro or dmc5?
[10:02:27] <%ThePuddingDead> if not it's being written like, RIGHT NOW
[10:02:32] <NumberTooBig> at this point not yet, people dont even know what the snek heart do
[10:02:34] <321Continue> Pat is the coolest bad boy
[10:02:35] <+Das_Prints> @angriestpat They are different types of action game but how’s this stacking up with DMCV if you had to rank the two as your favorite over the other?
[10:02:37] <+ChiefWilly> i have those same pajama pants
[10:02:41] <Nina96> Fromsoft fans be like that
[10:02:41] <%connos_livereview> dmc5
[10:02:44] <%connos_livereview> yeah
[10:02:46] <+tygermom> dmc5 for sure
[10:02:51] <%El_Desperad0> yeyeye
[10:02:53] <SidBoyTM> Well, I have some birthday sleep to catch up on so I'll see you next time pat. Sleep well chat!
[10:02:55] <NumberTooBig> DMC5, no question
[10:03:00] <+Rodzzila> Wouldn't be a From game without super combolutly side quest
[10:03:00] <+tygermom> sekiro is cool but i don't see myself playing this game a lot after I beat it
[10:03:05] <%Spydurman> darn real job
[10:03:07] <Kirby_Sauce> Busy what? Making babies?
[10:03:07] <$KnivesEve> dmc5 then, so it is written
[10:03:09] <+vinivss> @sidboytm sleep well
[10:03:10] <+fatal_penguin_> Ya'll are Crazy. Get ANTHEM
[10:03:12] <%Reizie_Etherealm> I think after all those fights you did the magical rice might be ready for harvest again, I'm not sure tho
[10:03:17] <%ThePuddingDead> @AngriestPat Also, is Paige feeling better since her last stream? I've been worried
[10:03:24] <%RubberFistFight> @Spydurman actually as a streamer myself, bots don't add to view counts as they don't render the video, and banning them from your chat has absolutely no effect. I'm constantly having to manually reset my stream currency to 0 on all the bot names since Twitch give me no other option besides banning them, and that doesn't prevent them actually being there.
[10:03:47] <laggy24111> Any more planned streams after Sekiro personally would love to see you play bioshock 1 and maybe Minerva's Den
[10:03:50] <LegendaryDorkKnight> pat u da man
[10:03:57] <+HeadsHeldHigh> Play Ape Escape coward
[10:04:21] <SunsetJack> Honestly, when you went outside of Ashina Castle, it got more interesting...
[10:04:21] <Nina96> DAT COMBAT THOUGH Kreygasm Kreygasm Kreygasm
[10:04:25] <LixFury> the exploration is great tho
[10:04:30] <+kyuubisonic> I mean NIoh was all about its combat
[10:04:38] <Darthwaffler> sbfpDattebayo
[10:04:41] <%El_Desperad0> Also, Sekiro is less fun and more frustration
[10:04:47] <Caidezes> It's Ninja Gaiden Lite.
[10:04:47] <LegendaryDorkKnight> close to Nioh as well I think
[10:04:48] <%Spydurman> @RubberFistFight huh didn't know, you think they'd have better tech to handle that shit
[10:04:50] <@Moobot> Whoa I don't even shout that much! (@Fenrirlives)
[10:04:58] <%connos_livereview> niohs loot system looked horrendous
[10:05:03] <%Reizie_Etherealm> Nioh still has character builds and different playstyles tho
[10:05:08] <%RubberFistFight> @AngriestPat it's about vertical exploration a bit though, with the grappling mechanic and whatnot. The game world is made massive simply by adding a Z-axis.
[10:05:10] <%TheGreatBamBe> what
[10:05:11] <%Ion_Laser> Fuck you Moobot. I was reading that!
[10:05:13] <SunsetJack> What?
