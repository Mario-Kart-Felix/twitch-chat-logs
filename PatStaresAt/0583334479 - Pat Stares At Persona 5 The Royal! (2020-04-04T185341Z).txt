[1:16:56] <dan_g_v> he said back then he could play it offscreen
[1:16:58] <%Rumbutt> If you don't get enough personas the first day you can you HAVE to fuse Arsene anyway
[1:16:59] <timetraveller2000> Can’t wait until Persona adds stupid shit like Bigfoot and Jersey Devil as Personas, that’d be hype
[1:16:59] <%optimasmaximas> @EdenOfLove tbf, he transferred that ability to it when he fused it from arsene

[1:17:14] <%jackythefrost> Persona 2 has the best narrative in Persona still to this day, but the gameplay is dated as hell
[1:17:17] <%SoFarFetched> @LeaIsChill Yeah chat was trying to help him on how to do it, and he was like "nvm another time"
[1:17:18] <fehraf> I wanna fight Hitler with Longinus again

[2:06:08] <missingangle> No play the rest of the game in it
[2:06:08] <saiyan24675> How can you touch his paw if he has Hoofs
[2:06:09] <%BallerSwagBro9k> NO
[2:06:09] <Warbot40> Need more turn based games
[2:06:10] <%Dragon_Batman> Makes sense
[2:06:10] <%shiplord13> Thats fine
[2:06:11] <%starotter70> Understandable
[2:06:12] <heartlesshealer> no check skill?

[2:06:20] <gooeycentre> don't like
[2:06:21] <+tigerfang86> HORSE
[2:06:23] <%GabeSweetMan> Oh this buddy again
[2:06:24] <%starotter70> I use the extra costumes in mementos
[2:06:27] <Zombrocom> Default still the best
[2:06:30] <saiyan24675> No Super Sentai
[2:06:30] <aeonicvector> Give Mona bighead mode @PatStaresAt
[2:06:31] <clintonificent> yeah this game has a ton of fanservice for P1/P2 fans and brings back the best mechanics from those games (negotiation, melee and ranged weapons, non-randomized dungeons, demons being the enemies instead of dumb P3/P4 shadows)
[2:06:39] <%MaddyCaddy> I like the Persona 2 one
[2:06:43] <gooeycentre> strange journey costume is cool
[2:06:44] <%bread_assassin> The Phantom's Thieves default outfits are so strong. I don't feel the need to use costumes.
[2:06:45] <+RadDude6969> SourPls
[2:06:57] <LeaIsChill> Can we at least see the party member's costumes?
[2:07:00] <$WackyXmand> I forgot how much Ann's ass sticks out
[2:07:03] <+pectusumbra> It could be fun to do full cast costume gags
[2:07:04] <+tigerfang86> 🍑
[2:07:10] <JumbleJams> p2 outfit has my favorite track
[2:07:11] <%argavus> featherman
[2:07:11] <+EdenOfLove> wait did he actually have that persona?
[2:07:11] <heartlesshealer> Strange Journey and Raidou costumes were dope
[2:07:22] <%s1rcuit> TO THE LAUNDROMAT
[2:07:27] <+bluedude153> CHIBI! MORGANA!
[2:07:33] <superchronicc> Imagine the main silent protag sounding just like Pat if he ever had a voice
[2:07:43] <thebiganxiety> Any SMT 4 armour stuff?
[2:07:54] <clintonificent> remember in p4g when you could do Yu-Chie-Yukiko-Naoto and put all the ladies in maid outfits and you can talk to them and they say the most amazingly fanservicey waifu shit ever
[2:07:54] <%MaddyCaddy> Yes
[2:07:56] <+pectusumbra> Yes
[2:07:58] <Zombrocom> Joker has a voice though
[2:08:02] <%UvBenServed> Twist their dicks
[2:08:02] <+scrumbotime> Burn Their Dicks
[2:08:04] <$spardanwarrior> Samurai outfit
[2:08:08] <+emperri> lookin kinda cool naruto
[2:08:14] <+bluedude153> That maid shit is sad

[2:08:31] <%thegreenbenis> LOOKING COOL JOKER
[2:08:34] <+emperri> daoud
[2:08:37] <%spiritofmojave> duoooode
[2:08:37] <+dirtyh4rr1> dawd
[2:08:39] <+linSP> daouede sandstorm
[2:08:40] <KaslinMagite> Oh God. She has a bit of a :3 face on her win splash screen
[2:08:41] <%herecomesmong0> Man that was easy
[2:08:43] <clintonificent> tbh i know self-insert silent protag is an SMT tradition, but I really wish they just gave Joker a canon name and voiced dialogue
[2:08:45] <+tigerfang86> BEEF
[2:08:45] <TwistedVerse> noice
[2:08:46] <ScreamLord> @PatStaresAt Do you know about the Kelpie in Celtic myth? They're evil horses trick people into mounting them and then they dive into the nearest water source to drown and eat them
[2:08:47] <+tigerfang86> usedBeef
[2:08:48] <%majindusto> DAOOOD!!!!
[2:08:57] <gps309> get huge

[2:09:03] <+BubbaRands> When did Kanji write a book Kappa
[2:09:04] <Charronia> Finally we know how to get huge
[2:09:05] <%starotter70> Gotta get some work done, see you guys later!
[2:09:06] <+Jp3g95> This is misable
[2:09:07] <theloganbrand> just auto recover
[2:09:07] <clintonificent> i know but in the game itself
[2:09:10] <Meekest> Bobby Ren Hill
[2:09:13] <%majindusto> Akira
[2:09:14] <%Dr00_PhD> fast travel
[2:09:16] <+bluedude153> Ill have to watch a vid for everyone else in New cinema outfits I guess
[2:09:20] <timetraveller2000> @screamlord that’s Hype AF
[2:09:21] <%DrFacilier> dont they respawn if u enter safe room?
[2:09:22] <%collind99> Ren in most things, Akira in the manga
[2:09:24] <gooeycentre> Kelpie are real. I saw one at the pub once
[2:09:29] <Eger007> safe room
[2:09:30] <Sol_Install> safe room yea
[2:09:32] <%Dr00_PhD> not in p5r
[2:09:33] <+RadDude6969> leave to a loading zone room and come back or reload
[2:09:44] <%arancet> reload the area, through ft, safe room, or new section
[2:09:46] <glasgow_mick89> Safe room/zones
[2:09:57] <%GabeSweetMan> I LOVE Morgana's win screen.
[2:10:02] <+Woronov> maan take over is a better theme then last surprise ... keeps growing on me
[2:10:04] <+dmtjinni> CHAT IS THERE ANY P5R GIVEAWAYS ON TWITTER Or YT :''''(
[2:10:07] <%herecomesmong0> Learning is for nerds
[2:10:09] <%foreverN2dust> yaes quen
[2:10:10] <timetraveller2000> @gabesweetman it’s one of the best IMO
[2:10:17] <ScreamLord> Morgana has a STRONG win screen
[2:10:19] <+RadDude6969> I didn't think of fast travel fml
[2:10:19] <clintonificent> they could either just call him Ren and not do the name-yourself thing, or they can be like FF10 which you can name your protagonist whatever but they're still fully voiced and everyone just refers to Tidus as THAT GUY or THE BLITZBALL FUCKO
[2:10:20] <%majindusto> Minato is P3 Protagonists name...And I will not hear otherwise
[2:10:24] <+xBolts4Lifex> Queen? If she breaths, shes a THOOOOOOOOOOOOT
[2:10:25] <%GabeSweetMan> @timetraveller2000 Pulls out a FUCKING CIGAR
[2:10:29] <%GabeSweetMan> It's so good.
[2:10:30] <Saltmeisterr> do not beg. buy with money
[2:10:32] <aeonicvector> dont forget you can give party members outfits, incase you want big head mona or Ryuji dressed as a Butler
[2:10:32] <%weissguard> Fun Fact: There's a Nendoroid of Morgana's win screen.
[2:10:43] <KaslinMagite> Wait, do your companions also have DLC outfits?
[2:10:45] <%Typhaeon> I would buy that nendoroid
[2:10:45] <timetraveller2000> @gabesweetman James Bond looking Mofo LUL
[2:10:51] <BlackOrchidKI> I don't like Take Over. There's something about the track that seems like it's trying too hard to get you excited, imo
[2:10:52] <+bluedude153> I just want big head ryugi ;-;
[2:11:00] <%GabeSweetMan> UH OH
[2:11:03] <+dmtjinni> @Saltmeisterr look at me a millionaire, i did lose my job no joke
[2:11:03] <+bluedude153> Yeah all the compnaions have variations on the same outfits
[2:11:04] <Charronia> naroBlush
[2:11:05] <%Dragon_Batman> Perfect
[2:11:06] <BlackOrchidKI> Last Surprise is too much of an instant classic
[2:11:07] <%jackythefrost> @PatStaresAt Might be a good idea to max out Mishima's SLink as fast as possible cause the rank 10 award is all back up members get full xp from battles
[2:11:19] <clintonificent> MUSCLE GUY
[2:11:24] <%Dragon_Batman> Look att he res

[2:11:40] <clintonificent> dungeon at risk
[2:11:43] <%mighty_max_t> I wish bgm wasn't tied to Jpker's costume and you could just CHOOSE
[2:11:44] <timetraveller2000> @blackorchidki the problem with P5 battle themes is that they get old FAST. They’re great songs, just not on hour long repeats
[2:11:44] <WanderingSwordsman> only after putting in the other books
[2:11:48] <%majindusto> Everyone has costumes...pat just refuses to put them on!!!!
[2:11:49] <+RogueMinja> You have to get the rest first, yeah/
[2:11:57] <%jackythefrost> wat
[2:12:08] <clintonificent> what is this kata you're doing
[2:12:14] <clintonificent> the kata of fast travel to trigger story
[2:12:20] <%jackythefrost> is this boy trying to grind in the first dungeon
[2:12:21] <timetraveller2000> @mighty_max_t same
[2:12:21] <cowcow6> they fukin DEAD
[2:12:24] <%Dragon_Batman> Maybe they changed it?

[2:12:35] <HungryHungryEmu> so how is pat able to stream p5r?
[2:12:37] <+rei0> nah it still works, just not yet
[2:12:38] <+RogueMinja> Gotta change floors.
[2:12:39] <JumbleJams> @timetraveller2000 i actually didn't mind p5's after dealing with the earworm that is p4
[2:12:41] <%suikudo> I think you have to actually leave and the dungeon totally and then come back
[2:12:41] <VJdarkworld> books POG
[2:12:52] <+RogueMinja> I think.
[2:12:55] <%FacetiousAF> Poggers and such
[2:13:03] <TonyPullMyDTRedgrave> @HungryHungryEmu why wouldn't he be able to?
[2:13:06] <+Daniel_Is_I> I like how it switched to investigation music
[2:13:07] <%jackythefrost> very easy puzzle inbound
[2:13:16] <%FacetiousAF> "pizzle"
[2:13:17] <cowcow6> he IS an ape but thats still rude to say
[2:13:17] <%Calek> @HungryHungryEmu by relying on Atlus' very strict rules and very lack enforcement
[2:13:21] <%FacetiousAF> "puzzle"
[2:13:27] <timetraveller2000> @jumblejams yeah, P4’s can get annoying too. Strangely, I never tired of Mass Destruction, don’t know why
[2:13:30] <TonyPullMyDTRedgrave> @Calek lmao

[2:13:46] <%mighty_max_t> No,Queen is in 2 dungeons
[2:13:56] <%jackythefrost> P4's OST is pop which I find gets old much faster than other genre's
[2:14:05] <+Daniel_Is_I> Nah that's old

[2:16:30] <%JohnAtDawn> It fucking baffles me that Atlus made it so hard to do palaces in one day yet enphesized the daily life stuff. Like, the more times you have to go to palaces, the less time you have for EVERYTHING ELSE.

[2:17:05] <%GabeSweetMan> That Bicorn had BPD.
[2:17:06] <clintonificent> reminds me of FF5 gimmick enemies
[2:17:07] <Goodvibes99508> "why did I explode?"
[2:17:14] <%hawk_rush> this makes me wanna buy P5R soon
[2:17:18] <saiyan24675> It touched by Killer Queen
[2:17:20] <%Dragon_Batman> I wouldn't be surprised if they hit super hard
[2:17:20] <Alzero83> Test it out now
[2:17:22] <%foreverN2dust> psaCrazyhand psaCrazyhead
[2:17:24] <reinbachthe3rd> RE3 Nightmare broke Max.

[2:17:42] <zenith0111> "HIT THIS ENEMY IDIOT"
[2:17:43] <clintonificent> or these remind me of those combat trials from P3 Portable! The speed door, magic door, kinda stuff
[2:17:47] <cowcow6> for you
[2:17:51] <reinbachthe3rd> The final two bosses aren't optimized for non-coin users.
[2:17:51] <%Dragon_Batman> Ryuji it is
[2:17:55] <OldManDeckardCain> TELL ME HOW TO DO MY TAXES TOO MONA
[2:17:59] <+xBolts4Lifex> LUL
[2:18:01] <Aydarkzero> d e t h
[2:18:03] <+evbites> gunnnnn
[2:18:04] <+dirtyh4rr1> that works
[2:18:05] <%reonome> that works
[2:18:06] <Sol_Install> Ryuji does tho
[2:18:09] <Charronia> The power of vineSchut
[2:18:09] <%dekkitout> G U N
[2:18:09] <+linSP> gun
[2:18:10] <shiny_prinny> wow gun is strong
[2:18:11] <timetraveller2000> @oldmandeckardcain you don’t CoolCat
[2:18:13] <%Typhaeon> Wimpy explosion from gun
[2:18:14] <%hawk_rush> gun is strong
[2:18:16] <SaltyDongs> gun is power
[2:18:17] <%suikudo> the thing goes SKrrrat
[2:18:17] <clintonificent> RE3 gets really stupid Dark Souls hard on Nightmare and Inferno
[2:18:19] <+RenoDeGeneric> Better fetch the Pat-Gat
[2:18:19] <quietshun> They do more damage depending on how much damage the hit that killed them did
[2:18:20] <+rooked4> My magic power is GUN
[2:18:21] <TDAWS_MP132> low damage means weak explosion. It does work tho
[2:18:21] <%suikudo> pop pop pop pop
[2:18:24] <+RadDude6969> for his neutral special he wields a GUN
[2:18:26] <quietshun> In the explosion'
[2:18:30] <NobuuNobuu> Some times it's better to weaken the rest so the explosion kills them all
[2:18:31] <+mem3_jesus> The explosion damage caused by the disaster shadow is relative to the damage you deal to it
[2:18:33] <cowcow6> if the enemys arnt spesefically resistant to gun u should use it literally every battle imo
[2:18:35] <CurrySauseBandit> Gun has weak overkill damage though :\
[2:18:38] <%hawk_rush> does carmen look different or is that me
[2:18:39] <zenith0111> Did anything change about all-out attack?
[2:18:44] <%hawk_rush> like, she looks colored differentely
[2:18:46] <+mem3_jesus> Or at least the last individual hit is
[2:18:50] <clintonificent> cool video game
[2:18:54] <clintonificent> we love a good video game
[2:19:01] <timetraveller2000> @hawk_rush I think it’s the lighting

[2:19:28] <%Dragon_Batman> Hah
[2:19:31] <%foreverN2dust> gainz
[2:19:31] <cowcow6> i didnt even fucking know about this what the fuck
[2:19:38] <%mighty_max_t> akihiko screams in the distance
[2:19:42] <pixelkenj> bonus goodies for exploring?
[2:19:43] <zenith0111> @currysausebandit I remember avoiding the attack because I was just so sick of seeing it
[2:19:44] <%Dr00_PhD> You use it at the gym later
[2:19:46] <%kyh9> Save it for when you're working out
[2:19:46] <Treuan> Nothing, what's a protein with you?
[2:19:47] <aeonicvector> @PatStaresAt bitch heal, but boosts workouts
[2:19:48] <timetraveller2000> @hawk_rush most of the models for Personas are the same, from what I’ve seen
[2:19:51] <KaitlynnHere> protein irl is also a tiny bitch heal
[2:19:52] <%GabeSweetMan> I DON'T LIKE THAT. I don't just random containers of PROTEIN hanging out.
[2:19:53] <+Jp3g95> 30% is tiny heal?
[2:19:56] <RetributionP> kamoshida protein
[2:19:57] <clintonificent> imagine if this game was like P1 where there's not only 2 endings, but 2 entire paths through the game
[2:19:58] <%GabeSweetMan> That is unsanitary!
[2:19:59] <KaitlynnHere> eat your protein kids
[2:19:59] <+mem3_jesus> Protein gives better stat increases at the gym later
[2:20:00] <%cylish> Dont use the protin till the game brings it up again
[2:20:02] <%kyh9> Why is joker hunched over like that?
[2:20:04] <%hawk_rush> @timetraveller2000 good to know!
[2:20:06] <clintonificent> Persona 1 is basically the dual scenario zapping system
[2:20:10] <$Corporate_Redeemer> You use it at the gym to up stats
[2:20:11] <timetraveller2000> @clintonificent that’d be hype
[2:20:14] <%j0ustar> P5 being like "I shall heal myself with this Clif bar"
[2:20:22] <+RadDude6969> I wouldn't eat anything from that palace
[2:20:23] <Goodvibes99508> it's a scaling heal?
[2:20:34] <clintonificent> imagine P5 being a two scenario game and each scenario is 100 hours just like the base game
[2:20:37] <zenith0111> Oh right the freaking social stats. Because this game is half life sim
[2:20:38] <clintonificent> gotta get the true ending
[2:20:42] <clintonificent> better play it through all again
[2:20:44] <Alzero83> Im so glad they changed the way you capture the same persona if you already have it in your party, its such a nice QoL upgrade
[2:20:49] <$Corporate_Redeemer> Or when working out in your room you can use protein
[2:20:57] <%reonome> uh oh, time to grind
[2:20:59] <clintonificent> actually that's BASICALLY Persona 2 but 40 hours instead of 100
[2:21:05] <%Valdorick> Grind baby grind
[2:21:05] <clintonificent> with innocent sin and eternal punishment
[2:21:08] <xeros720> goblins rejoice!
[2:21:11] <RetributionP> ResidentSleeper
[2:21:21] <%hawk_rush> @Corporate_Redeemer is that in the base game too?
[2:21:23] <WanderingSwordsman> @corporate_redeemer which stats lvl up?
[2:21:23] <+CuddlyKaiju> psaGoblin psaGoblin psaGoblin psaGoblin
[2:21:29] <Alzero83> Grind Time!
[2:21:38] <%Typhaeon> My true form is Savage Deviljho
[2:21:41] <%trustycoyote> You're right Pat. This game is SO comfy.
[2:21:43] <%j0ustar> the grind begins
[2:21:50] <xeros720> goblin festival in here
[2:21:54] <%Dragon_Batman> psaBig levels next stream ahoy
[2:22:00] <tacoisgoods> Is this gonna turn into the DS3 LP again?
[2:22:11] <%Typhaeon> Break this game over your knee
[2:22:17] <Alzero83> You sure about that, Pat Kappa
[2:22:21] <%suikudo> @tacoisgoods worse
[2:22:23] <+linSP> whats he talking about
[2:22:25] <$Corporate_Redeemer> @wanderingswordsman Just your health and SP. SP doesn't get upped by much but one of the new confidants ups your SP by 5 every time you hang with them
[2:22:28] <%jackythefrost> Yea, you can get a 200% xp boost in mementos now
[2:22:28] <%GabeSweetMan> "So I've been grinding offscreen...."
[2:22:31] <%shaidot> Mementos is even more broken in royal
[2:22:31] <+rei0> man i dont mind grinding in mementos but that mementos music is not good
[2:22:34] <+LandOfTheWay> ah, the good ol flu season trick
[2:22:34] <+RadDude6969> I hear Mementosnis way better now haven't got there yet tho
[2:22:38] <%republicofu> the true grind begins after unlocking treasure demons
[2:22:41] <%herecomesmong0> HUGE GRIND NUMBER
[2:22:42] <%Dragon_Batman> So I can now use the final persona
[2:22:43] <%Dr00_PhD> We'll see the results
[2:22:50] <+ChrisAlgoo> i love the mementos music, it's so droning
[2:22:52] <WanderingSwordsman> ah then the same as the og
[2:22:56] <%Keyd00d> lookin cool joker
[2:22:57] <+yolothewizard> But I wanna see the shit!
[2:22:59] <CurrySauseBandit> @zenith0111 Sorry for the late reply, was in a call. But yeah I understand the feel. Got tedious after awhile but there may be some new victory cuts for some characters. We'll see.
[2:22:59] <cdev57> flu season trick doesnt work anymore
[2:23:00] <%jackythefrost> No the flu season reaper trick is gone in royal
[2:23:01] <timetraveller2000> @gabesweetman 3 weeks later “ Alright, time to beat Kamoshida” Kappa
[2:23:03] <+dylin456> is there a lot of new content with royal
[2:23:03] <Alzero83> Stop killing Pixie, shes already dead!
[2:23:05] <$Corporate_Redeemer> @landoftheway The Flu trick no longer works
[2:23:08] <fruit_pie_the_magician> I didn't even break this game as hard as I probably could have and hard mode was still easy. I think I literally died one time because of confuse complications
[2:23:11] <%Keyd00d> Joker you look cool
[2:23:13] <+mem3_jesus> Did they really fix the reaper instakill? man that sucks
[2:23:14] <TobikoOfWind> yep. rip us
[2:23:18] <%spiritofmojave> Shit they took away flu season?
[2:23:19] <%shaidot> The first two times you go to mementos do it on camera!
[2:23:21] <+LandOfTheWay> Shit, that's gonna make grinding a pain now
[2:23:26] <CurrySauseBandit> @zenith0111 Won't really change me from using it as a buff phase though LUL
[2:23:33] <+linSP> what if they added a mash to speed up the all out attack animation
[2:23:37] <Ubu2933> man guns are so broken now that you restore ammo
[2:23:39] <+RadDude6969> weird, never fought reaper in og tho
[2:23:52] <%jackythefrost> yea but now you can just get a 200% xp boost and Ryuji's skill
[2:23:59] <+LandOfTheWay> OOH, that's super good
[2:24:01] <+tigerfang86> so really
[2:24:06] <%jackythefrost> its almost as fast as reaper
[2:24:07] <+tigerfang86> it's like it's way easier than even before
[2:24:12] <+mem3_jesus> Really, I knew it instakilled enemies and sometimes gave you the Persona but thats a great change
[2:24:14] <%Klefth> Oh, great, so now Ryuji doesn't further ruin Mementos
[2:24:15] <%spiritofmojave> Oh so he actually is useful, good!
[2:24:18] <$Corporate_Redeemer> Just fight the Reaper like normal Kappa
[2:24:24] <zenith0111> @currysausebandit Baton Pass is so good. Got all party members to learn it and it carried me through maniac
[2:24:27] <+mem3_jesus> omegaLUL
[2:24:37] <%herecomesmong0> I love that slav pose
[2:24:39] <+Chewygamer> If you have persona 5 can you get this as DLC or do you need to buy the whole thing over again
[2:24:45] <timetraveller2000> Ryuji’s insta kill ability in OG P5 was actually infuriating late game, never been more desperate to grind in my life NotLikeThis
[2:24:46] <+PrincessLuna85> @mem3_jesus it always give you the persona now if you have room so its very good for farming levels on your persona too
[2:24:52] <%Ascethetic> @PatStaresAt auto heal does the same thing as doing it manually
[2:24:55] <COMB711> Who's getting the boot when best boy Yusuke rolls up?
[2:25:02] <RecklessPrinny> What is up with the sound
[2:25:02] <%ZephynM> I like how chill the music is in this game.
[2:25:05] <RecklessPrinny> did he pitch it up?
[2:25:05] <%jackythefrost> @Chewygamer just like P3FES and P4G you have to buy the whole game over again
[2:25:07] <+pectusumbra> no, it casts from MP first
[2:25:07] <%Ascethetic> @PatStaresAt it uses dia
[2:25:07] <Alzero83> takes MP\
[2:25:08] <+RadDude6969> @chewygamer gotta buy this one since it's a new version
[2:25:08] <%arancet> @PatStaresAt sp is more valuable here then items, use items!
[2:25:09] <fruit_pie_the_magician> @Chewygamer HAHAHAHA
[2:25:09] <tacoisgoods> no SP only
[2:25:10] <timetraveller2000> @chewygamer you have to buy this as a separate game, full price
[2:25:11] <cdev57> uses SP
[2:25:12] <%angel949> Sp first
[2:25:14] <Alzero83> Takes MP form the Party
[2:25:14] <TDAWS_MP132> SP only
[2:25:16] <%Klefth> Autoheal is usually not super efficient, though
[2:25:17] <Dangan12> @patstaresat and a persona
[2:25:23] <RecklessPrinny> Did he pitch up the sound?
[2:25:26] <+Daniel_Is_I> Does it matter if it uses items if you're never gonna use items?
[2:25:28] <+mem3_jesus> @PrincessLuna85 PogChamp PogChamp PogChamp
[2:25:29] <%Typhaeon> This guy kicked my ass the first time'
[2:25:34] <SwindlerOfProgress> @RecklessPrinny I think that's a Twitch thing. I've been having that happen on a bunch of streams this week.
[2:25:34] <%Rumbutt> This room has been vastly improved
[2:25:38] <%Dragon_Batman> @RecklessPrinny Twitch is trying to catch you up and it sounds off, try refreshing
[2:25:41] <RecklessPrinny> ah
[2:25:49] <BoneofMalkav> This place is huge, that means it has huge guts LUL
[2:25:52] <$Corporate_Redeemer> It uses a small amount of SP I think. It never feels like it ever uses any real amount of SP per auto-heal
[2:25:52] <+ChrisAlgoo> very kind of the game to warn you about this stuff
[2:25:57] <$WackyXmand> those leaves are new
[2:25:58] <%hawk_rush> this area looks re-done
[2:25:59] <%kyh9> Man, you sure are smart Ann
[2:26:01] <%CappuccinoGuil> Makes sense
[2:26:06] <%kyh9> Really, you can't believe it?
[2:26:09] <zenith0111> Does this make OG P5 obsolete?
[2:26:11] <%Keyd00d> FREAKING
[2:26:14] <%Ascethetic> @Corporate_Redeemer it uses the sp needed to fuly heal everyone
[2:26:14] <%kyh9> Just shoot him irl
[2:26:16] <%spiritofmojave> @zenith0111 absolutely
[2:26:20] <fateirony> man I always forget how ON THE Nose the dialog is
[2:26:23] <timetraveller2000> @zenith0111 I’d say yeah

[2:26:38] <+ChrisAlgoo> @fateirony genius kojumbo strikes again

[2:28:44] <%reonome> i don't think he even has a weakness
[2:28:49] <%jackythefrost> Thats the issue with most atlus games now, they release a better version of the game down the line that makes the older version obsilete, like theres no reason to ever play OG P3 or OG Strange Journey ever again
[2:28:52] <+fgcmorad> Guns seem kinda OP in royal
[2:28:54] <filialpails> I'm somewhat weak to gun myself
[2:28:58] <%arancet> @Ascethetic no, each char gets 1 clip's worth per battle now
[2:28:59] <Aydarkzero> so anyway i started blastin
[2:28:59] <Hoot_Patoots> by the power of friendship and this GUN i found
[2:28:59] <%CappuccinoGuil> USE GUN
[2:29:00] <%angel949> Sleep him then get a technical
[2:29:01] <%GabeSweetMan> YEYEYE
[2:29:05] <+Daniel_Is_I> Yeah he has no weakness
[2:29:07] <zenith0111> @spiritofmojave Yeah P5 was already really long with arguably too much to do.
[2:29:12] <+ChrisAlgoo> GUN GUN GUN GUN
[2:29:16] <%herecomesmong0> No one can withstand the power of GUN
[2:29:18] <%Ascethetic> @arancet thanks, good to know
[2:29:19] <quietshun> Gun is only op in the 1st palace, it evens out later
[2:29:21] <%CappuccinoGuil> Ancient Archangel Knight Magic <<<<<< GUNS GUNS GUNS
[2:29:25] <%j0ustar> GUN, the best Persona
[2:29:28] <timetraveller2000> @zenith0111 better to much than too little imo
[2:29:29] <ScreamLord> The Power of God is no match for my power of Gun!
[2:29:29] <mackonslaught> oooo
[2:29:31] <%majindusto> "SO I STARTED BLASTING"
[2:29:33] <mackonslaught> you're looking cool, Joker!

[2:29:35] <+LandOfTheWay> CHEESE IT
[2:29:36] <%Dragon_Batman> Neat

[2:29:56] <timetraveller2000> Grapple away Jebaited
[2:29:57] <%Rumbutt> Because EVERYONE hated that moment in the original and got FUCKED oroLUL
[2:30:06] <Anger_Panda> It is the fuzz, Joker
[2:30:09] <zenith0111> @timetraveller2000 This is the only game where it gives me anxiety for that. Which is not what I want
[2:30:19] <TheZearGuy> I forget, does he ever use that again?
[2:30:20] <%WhereIsWill> @PatStaresAt i know you can release the persona collection on switch do it!
[2:30:27] <%Keyd00d> stranger danger
[2:30:31] <KericInfinitum> STRANGER DANGER
[2:30:35] <%shurtal> Stranger danger?
[2:30:41] <nesbitt22> Does Johnny Young voice the MC?
[2:30:46] <timetraveller2000> @zenith0111 fair enough, I was just saying it could be way worse. I agree that it gets overwhelming tho
[2:30:47] <%Klefth> Being able to baton pass from the start is kinda busted
[2:30:48] <%Keyd00d> Nope
[2:30:51] <zenith0111> @timetraveller2000 Sakurai almost didn't put Joker in smash because of that feeling.
[2:30:53] <+LandOfTheWay> @nesbitt22 xander mobus
[2:30:54] <theloganbrand> Doesn't r1 automatically bring up a skill that the enemy is weak to?
[2:30:54] <+mem3_jesus> Nah its Xander Mobus
[2:30:55] <+love_otter> @nesbitt22 Xander Mobus
[2:30:56] <%Keyd00d> Xavier something, the Smash announcer
[2:31:00] <%Keyd00d> yeah Xander
[2:31:02] <%spiritofmojave> @nesbitt22 it'a the Smash announcer, Xander Mobus
[2:31:03] <%hawk_rush> I thought it was Johnny but nah
[2:31:03] <%Dr00_PhD> @nesbitt22 he did in p4
[2:31:08] <%CappuccinoGuil> Can a Persona level up past your current level?
[2:31:11] <%optimasmaximas> nice ryuji
[2:31:15] <nesbitt22> Thx chat
[2:31:16] <timetraveller2000> @cappuccinoguil yup
[2:31:24] <%Calek> @CappuccinoGuil they usually do
[2:31:28] <aeonicvector> @CappuccinoGuil yes, but its hard to do
[2:31:29] <Meekest> I think its just a Quality of Life change considering you can Baton Pass early though
[2:31:35] <aeonicvector> fusion exp and sacc exp
[2:31:40] <%arancet> it just makes the castle much more fun
[2:31:43] <theloganbrand> Morganna was weak for so long
[2:31:47] <%Keyd00d> Oh wow I forgot baton wasn't in the first dungeon
[2:31:50] <aeonicvector> are the onyl way, and personas level slower then players later game
[2:31:51] <+ChrisAlgoo> it makes sense too, it's a core part of the battle system
[2:31:52] <%Klefth> Yeah, that's how every Persona goes pretty much. First dungeon is the hardest LUL
[2:31:53] <+yunngin> i never got far in this game but in the beginning you're really weak it felt like
[2:31:54] <zenith0111> Baton Pass is THE BEST
[2:31:55] <ne_zha> it lets you use new team mates immediately
[2:31:56] <%TheSniperJoe> The game is a fair bit more challenging and they've changed up some boss fights, so having baton pass early kinda evens out.
[2:31:56] <+mem3_jesus> Was Baton Pass really not in the first dungeon
[2:31:56] <%Rumbutt> And then having to bench every new member until you unlocked baton pass sucked too
[2:31:57] <+LandOfTheWay> ngl, first dungeon actually gave me trouble in vanilla, mostly cause i took it all on in one day
[2:31:58] <%Dr00_PhD> Also not having it on the new party member sucked
[2:32:00] <+pectusumbra> I'm hopeful for whatever they give Haru
[2:32:01] <+love_otter> This version of the game does seem a looooot easier, in general
[2:32:02] <xeros720> yeah, baton pass gives a lot more options
[2:32:03] <%CappuccinoGuil> Got it. I thought there was a hard lock, like with the fusions
[2:32:04] <%optimasmaximas> you could get it for the first dungeon before
[2:32:11] <%spiritofmojave> I didn't remember getting batom pass for a long while so that's pretty nice as an innate thing
[2:32:12] <$WackyXmand> without it the beginning is slow and also having to wait to get a social links to get baton pass
[2:32:15] <%optimasmaximas> just have to put off doing the palace for a bit
[2:32:18] <+pectusumbra> I mean the fact that she gets to shoot grenades all the time is nice
[2:32:19] <fruit_pie_the_magician> I want Pat to play Nocturne just because the music is fucking boss
[2:32:25] <+jjjkopf> baton pass was only thr first time you went to momentros
[2:32:36] <shevan123> good old cold coffee
[2:32:41] <Huntercd> !uptime
[2:32:42] <@Moobot> I've been playing this game for how long? Oh only 2h 32m.
[2:32:42] <+RenoDeGeneric> Was there a demi-fiend costume?
[2:32:44] <ScreamLord> DansGame
[2:32:46] <zenith0111> Pat playing Nocturne would be SSS Tier
[2:32:46] <%iwa5h4ck3d> the music and battle dialogue overlap too much NotLikeThis
[2:32:51] <+BubbaRands> EWW lukewarm DansGame
[2:32:55] <Valentinius_Anodyne> Alas, no Demifiend
[2:32:55] <%Klefth> Cold coffee is alright, but it fucking messes up your stomach
[2:33:03] <%optimasmaximas> @jjjkopf coulda swire you could get it by leveling up your confidants?
[2:33:03] <+RenoDeGeneric> wack
[2:33:04] <%Jickiechan> @PatStaresAt hey pat what's your favourite Persona game

[2:33:56] <ScreamLord> I love that Skull eats shit for his win screen
[2:33:58] <+Brickston> Is it time to PAY AGAIN TO PLAY THE SAME GAME
[2:34:00] <%GabeSweetMan> It's fine. We just wanna see the new content asap.
[2:34:06] <%herecomesmong0> Cheat for number
[2:34:07] <zenith0111> @fruit_pie_the_magician Hell yeah. I love Nocturnes atmosphere
[2:34:10] <%jackythefrost> Best SMT game is either DDS2 or STrange Journey Redux
[2:34:14] <+Brickston> ehhh, I probably will too
[2:34:14] <%Klefth> Purchasable cheats
[2:34:14] <%Typhaeon> P5 save data cheats too
[2:34:14] <grimshuck> oh
[2:34:14] <%optimasmaximas> @filialpails ooh that's good
[2:34:19] <+fgcmorad> That explains it, at this point in the palace I exhausted half my SP already
[2:34:24] <Valentinius_Anodyne> Strange Journey is my favorite SMT
[2:34:27] <%Meltdown547> Cheats are fine when royale doesn't accept original game save files for NG+. Not going to do the whole thing from scratch again.
[2:34:31] <%Typhaeon> Yep
[2:34:31] <%shaidot> new content is coming up after this section
[2:34:31] <gps309> DLCheats
[2:34:37] <$lotharrio> Ladies and Gentlemen? We got 'em!
[2:34:37] <fruit_pie_the_magician> It's like "Welp, Everythings fucked. Better make the most of it.
[2:34:38] <%GabeSweetMan> Honestly it would STILL have been preferable to start the game in NG+ state using your existing Clear Game save.
[2:34:39] <%MaddyCaddy> But that's intended game design
[2:34:39] <%Ascethetic> CHEAT FOR EVERGREEN CONTENT
[2:34:50] <cdev57> will seeds give you more sp now
[2:34:51] <COMB711> Did they remove looking cool joker
[2:34:57] <shevan123> what the fuck did you just say
[2:35:00] <+FrenchTact1cs> Was the SP changed or something?
[2:35:01] <%optimasmaximas> no @COMB711
[2:35:01] <+LandOfTheWay> considering my username comes from a strange journey song, i think it's pretty clear that's my favorite
[2:35:02] <%shaidot> yeah will seeds
[2:35:02] <%FacetiousAF> cheat because fuck it
[2:35:09] <%Rumbutt> Useful, if you weren't a big cheater

[2:35:22] <COMB711> @optimasmaximas very happy to hear this
[2:35:23] <+fgcmorad> C'est pas tres gentil ca
[2:35:23] <+RenoDeGeneric> Smacked us with that leaf language
[2:35:30] <+love_otter> I also heard him speaking in tongues for a moment
[2:35:31] <%mankeyfigh> !uptime
[2:35:31] <%FacetiousAF> hi new guys, welcome to pat stares at where we lie, cheat, snitch, and say wrong things
[2:35:31] <@Moobot> I've been playing this game for how long? Oh only 2h 35m.
[2:35:32] <xeros720> grass
[2:35:33] <KasiCrafter> Doesn't the CHEATING negate some of the dating sim balance/pacing, though?
[2:35:40] <+pectusumbra> That clown talk
[2:35:42] <Retinolgaming> moon2JIMBO
[2:35:44] <Japanfreak2595> I cried when I found that I can turn the camera while hiding
[2:35:46] <%spiritofmojave> Ryuji has not said one full fuck, and that's horrible
[2:35:47] <%bigboy3d> T'es mieux d'y crisser une volée à cte Kamoshida.
[2:35:50] <theloganbrand> Did you get all the chests in that room?
[2:35:50] <fruit_pie_the_magician> I mean fuck I'd settle for having Pat listen to Nocturne music for half an hour.
[2:35:51] <+Brickston> Ryuji is just Kanji mixed with Yosuke/Junpei because he's your first friend. Which really just makes him a bitch Kanji
[2:35:52] <quietshun> new stuff
[2:35:56] <%GabeSweetMan> But most of us has already seen like 90% of it..
[2:35:59] <Lionkevinson> French that I cannot understand

[2:36:02] <%GabeSweetMan> So we wanna see the new stuff.

[2:36:08] <timetraveller2000> @spiritofmojave he does drop an actual F bomb at some point
[2:36:08] <xeros720> pat is crazy enough to max all confidents on first play anyways
[2:36:09] <%bigboy3d> WOW t'es ben cool Joker!
[2:36:26] <+Brickston> ugh, using the english dub?
[2:36:34] <aeonicvector> @zenith0111 more time to social since dungeon part of dungeon takes 1 day
[2:36:34] <%Dragon_Batman> I was 1 off from my og playthrough so I'm shure you still can
[2:36:35] <Kraegeth> the dlc persona definitely break the balance but the items arent a huge deal
[2:36:37] <jj61794> Why is hardly anyone streaming this game/
[2:36:41] <jj61794> It is so good
[2:36:41] <%thegreatbambe> fuck those people tbh

[2:36:52] <%BallerSwagBro9k> FUCK THOSE PEOPLE
[2:36:54] <striberx> @PatStaresAt Plus this is a great dub.
[2:36:54] <+BubbaRands> Yeeerrrrp
[2:36:55] <%suikudo> @jj61794 Because atlus is threatening people
[2:36:56] <%herecomesmong0> On old time radio
[2:36:56] <%Dr00_PhD> I'm listening to him play p5r while playing p5r
[2:36:59] <+LandOfTheWay> dub isn't even bad
[2:37:00] <eco419> That’s me :)
[2:37:01] <$Trenr> the english really isn't too bad
[2:37:01] <+BubbaRands> Dub is better tho
[2:37:02] <JumbleJams> im animating while i watch, dual-screen baby
[2:37:02] <Dragovus> @PatStaresAt You are the king of old timey radio
[2:37:02] <%Laecerelius> I'm listening while playing the videogames
[2:37:02] <%Typhaeon> People don't want the Atlus banhammer descending from on high
[2:37:02] <+Brickston> I can't stand persona if Morgana isn't screeching in my ear at a pitch audible only to dogs
[2:37:03] <Charronia> The P5 radio show rooW
[2:37:03] <%j0ustar> If it turns an 80 hour grind into a 30 hour grind, I'm all up for cheats anyday.
[2:37:03] <%jackythefrost> Honestly the sub and dub for this game sound identical
[2:37:04] <LeetRunt> I'm one of those people
[2:37:04] <%spiritofmojave> y-yeah who would do that :)
[2:37:04] <%miguelrod777> fucking casual can instatranslate in their head
[2:37:05] <bleugh> why can't they just learn japanese
[2:37:06] <Retinolgaming> yep, pat is my second monitor while I play a game
[2:37:07] <%blackbaron98> ME
[2:37:07] <Anger_Panda> I genuinely like this dub
[2:37:08] <viewtifulr> one guy wants jpn
[2:37:09] <%Typhaeon> I disagree that it's better but it's not bad
[2:37:10] <%joylent_blue> its me i'm bitches
[2:37:11] <%Meltdown547> Let's also b honest with ourselves: Sp Adhesive was the biggest cheat item in original.
[2:37:15] <fruit_pie_the_magician> Yeah if I had to listen to the english version I would NOT have played this. I got an hour into P3 and couldn't handle it anymore
[2:37:15] <%Storm_Samurai> If you're just listening how can you be typing huh
[2:37:15] <%Klefth> Gotta wash em
[2:37:15] <jj61794> @suikudo Again...? I thought we were past this after Vanilla Persona 5...
[2:37:17] <%Typhaeon> Except for the dumb pronunciation choices
[2:37:17] <%Dragon_Batman> I think the dub is fantastic
[2:37:19] <+fgcmorad> Gotta wash them
[2:37:20] <%herecomesmong0> I listen while I'm trying to s rank re3make
[2:37:23] <TG_Cid11> you have to clean them I think
[2:37:23] <%suikudo> @jj61794 lol nope
[2:37:25] <%Ultimatefool> Those are laundry
[2:37:27] <+tigerfang86> HMMMMM
[2:37:29] <zeif00> I find both the eng and jpn dub to be eh
[2:37:30] <Ayy_Nick17> oh shit

[2:38:37] <JehutyVer2> The Super Baby Method?
[2:38:39] <clintonificent> i remember before they announced the Japanese voice DLC (which was then incorporated into the main game as an apology for delaying the game I believe?), I saw weebs on GameFAQs and Reddit boards saying that everyone must boycott the game so we get the TRUE Japanese version and that not having an English dub and no Japanese dub is censorship
[2:38:39] <%startstoprepeat> joker will seed his female party members
[2:38:39] <%GabeSweetMan> Qlipoth Belehit?!
[2:38:40] <Tiewolf> But what does it do tho?

[2:39:29] <+fgcmorad> Put that in your butt
[2:39:29] <jj61794> @PatStaresAt If you find all three of them in a palace they turn into a strong accessory.
[2:39:29] <ne_zha> imagine dante and vergil as demons here
[2:39:30] <+GundamF91> POWER
[2:39:31] <TheFranss> While this stream is going, I'm trying to get my damn GTA IV refunded because R* chose to update the game and shut down/ remove content from the game, including the MP
[2:39:31] <%GabeSweetMan> HOW?
[2:39:31] <$lotharrio> Feed it to your demon to make him wahoo-pizza-time.
[2:39:34] <%narusao> nothing happened? ... or did it?
[2:39:36] <+Brickston> Find all the Fairies to get the Great Fairy Sword
[2:39:42] <%GabeSweetMan> uh huh
[2:39:42] <+tigerfang86> He can tell because SHUT UP
[2:39:44] <+tigerfang86> SHUT UP THO
[2:39:46] <%narusao> FailFish
[2:39:48] <%spiritofmojave> SHHHH
[2:39:52] <xeros720> i imagine we need all those for poochy's dungeon
[2:39:55] <+linSP> NO SHUT UP
[2:39:56] <+NitronStreams> "Theres a Quiphoth in the fridge" "Eat it?"
[2:39:57] <+2DSuperiority> embrace catness
[2:39:57] <%LaughingCatt> caaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaat
[2:40:00] <%suikudo> i gotta shut the hell up
[2:40:00] <+agumon9000> They completely ignored the question of how he could tell
[2:40:01] <missingangle> just hush, kitty
[2:40:01] <timetraveller2000> Not a Cat CoolCat CoolCat
[2:40:01] <Blank9> he is NOT a baby
[2:40:03] <filialpails> catboys are valid
[2:40:05] <+Brickston> Is he though? Or is he a Teddie shadow thing?
[2:40:07] <%optimasmaximas> PogChamp
[2:40:08] <+love_otter> Thats what you need
[2:40:09] <%Zebroneath> That's nice
[2:40:09] <%trustycoyote> Oh neat
[2:40:11] <%thegreatbambe> ah useless
[2:40:13] <zenith0111> My cat also likes to walk on 2 legs :)
[2:40:15] <%LaughingCatt> so good if you aren the big cheats
[2:40:16] <%spiritofmojave> and look like a cat, and have cat dialogue, and-
[2:40:19] <TDAWS_MP132> they do more then that
[2:40:19] <bxdragon> Do you though?
[2:40:23] <%CappuccinoGuil> Wait, it just recovers SP?
[2:40:25] <+dirtyh4rr1> YOU...SEED?
[2:40:25] <%Dragon_Batman> Closed one
[2:40:27] <%Calek> not useless for non-big fat cheaters!
[2:40:29] <%Dragon_Batman> close*
[2:40:29] <%reonome> lucky bastard
[2:40:31] <%optimasmaximas> LUL
[2:40:32] <xeros720> well, that's some incentive
[2:40:34] <%Meltdown547> A one time recovery, or...?
[2:40:35] <%shaidot> It does way more than that
[2:40:42] <fruit_pie_the_magician> Boivin, his eyes uncovered
[2:40:44] <$WackyXmand> to keep you going it seems, nice
[2:40:45] <clintonificent> @zenith0111 oh yeah I'm not defending that part of it, DLC voice is awful but they weren't even boycotting the game based on that, it was purely the fact that it wouldn't have a Japanese dub at launch LUL i think they literally said "No Dub No Buy"
[2:40:46] <timetraveller2000> I recommend going for all 3 seeds. For reasons
[2:40:48] <Valentinius_Anodyne> It undoubtably unlocks something
[2:40:49] <jj61794> @CappuccinoGuil You also get a good bonus if you collect all three in a palace, but not sure if I can say without it being a spoiler.
[2:40:52] <%Calek> individual will seeds give a one time SP recovery when you find them, find them all for a good thing
[2:40:55] <%Klefth> High mitama
[2:41:02] <clintonificent> No Subs No Buy*
[2:41:11] <+Jp3g95> There's 3 Will Seeds in a Palace. Each heals you a little. You get all 3 and you get an Equipment item
[2:41:15] <%CappuccinoGuil> @jj61794 yeah, probably best to drop it for now
[2:41:18] <+fgcmorad> Take over is so good
[2:41:23] <clintonificent> long story short weebs are big dum and Personer is good
[2:41:25] <Anger_Panda> This enemy yells like an Eric Andre audience member
[2:41:32] <$Corporate_Redeemer> Not using DLC persona?
[2:41:38] <Tiewolf> so what's the difference between the 2 games?
[2:41:42] <%SoFarFetched> too broken to use DLC persona LUL
[2:41:47] <clintonificent> OH REALLY
[2:41:48] <jj61794> @Corporate_Redeemer Probably best to not, the DLC Personas are Game Breaking.
[2:41:50] <%FacetiousAF> i
[2:41:51] <clintonificent> NOW YOU HAVE LIMITS
[2:41:52] <+Brickston> @clintonificent you can't be a purse owner fan if you haven't played personally-burned undubs of P3 and P4
[2:41:52] <%shaidot> you can fuse them naturally anyway
[2:41:55] <timetraveller2000> @mtiewolf Royal has extra content
[2:41:57] <%Typhaeon> What a good party member
[2:41:57] <Kraegeth> even at level the dlc persona are crazy
[2:41:59] <+fgcmorad> Orpheus and shit are busted
[2:42:01] <Copperama> CHEAT MAXIMUM YOU COWARD
[2:42:02] <%Calek> using DLC items is tiny cheating, DLC Persona's is BIG CHEATING
[2:42:02] <%FacetiousAF> "i'll cheat, but i won't break the game right away" - pat
[2:42:04] <Anger_Panda> I prefer a Silky Whip
[2:42:05] <aeonicvector> I think dlc-sonas are fine when you FUSE into them
[2:42:08] <fateirony> he says WHILE CHEATING
[2:42:14] <megaman_sentinel> they r just broken
[2:42:14] <LeaIsChill> They're crazy until Kaneshiro
[2:42:16] <%suikudo> dlc persona is huge cheating
[2:42:18] <COMB711> use the vincent costume to big cheat on everyone
[2:42:19] <+AvjRazz> Persona 5 Pat's Royal Dancing
[2:42:20] <+love_otter> How can you make this even easier? You're at max easy already!
[2:42:20] <%plus_on_black> Yo Pat, is the ultimate edition worth copping?
[2:42:23] <+LandOfTheWay> yeah, use those things early and you might as well just be playing NG+
[2:42:23] <%Owkono> soft cheats
[2:42:25] <zenith0111> DLC Persona? You mean p2w? Kappa
[2:42:26] <clintonificent> @Brickston i personally moved to Japan to experience Japanese high school life so I could experience the TRUE Persona 4 Golden
[2:42:27] <worldbrand> how dare you cheat on normal mode
[2:42:30] <%spiritofmojave> there's not a single non-cheating DLC persona
[2:42:31] <%shaidot> you can get the other two will seeds right away here
[2:42:33] <timetraveller2000> DLC Persona’s are actually game breaking LUL
[2:42:37] <%CappuccinoGuil> THAT'S A DICK
[2:42:38] <%hawk_rush> hey guys, missed out on the new content. what was the tree sapling that pat found?
[2:42:39] <zenith0111> Yeah but you don't get sp regen until like mid- end game
[2:42:44] <%GarbageNirvana> Ult edition is probably worth it if you don't wanna spend an extra $60 on costumes
[2:42:44] <tacoisgoods> Just casually strolling into kamoshida's boss fight with Messiah is totally not cheating though
[2:42:45] <aeonicvector> @spiritofmojave Ariadne in PQ2
[2:42:48] <%Typhaeon> Not big surprise that it's a giant phallus
[2:42:50] <$WackyXmand> oh this room looks way better
[2:42:53] <$Corporate_Redeemer> I remember using one of them back in P5 and it took me longer to get through the first palace since their SP costs are nuts
[2:43:01] <+Brickston> @clintonificent I could never go to the moon, I just watch it's cartoons
[2:43:08] <timetraveller2000> @hawk_rush Will Seed. There are 3 in each Palace, and getting all means a good thing
[2:43:19] <cdev57> theres a grapple point in here pat!
[2:43:23] <%hawk_rush> @timetraveller2000 thank you!
[2:43:35] <timetraveller2000> @hawk_rush no problem :)
[2:43:41] <+AvjRazz> The flying gumdrop persona
[2:43:46] <zeif00> I kinda wish you could set it so the music doesnt change during hold up
[2:44:01] <timetraveller2000> The dreaded miss NotLikeThis NotLikeThis
[2:44:01] <$WackyXmand> pretty sure this was the room full of boxes
[2:44:07] <clintonificent> @Brickston I am an expert in Japanese culture. I know shame and honor has a lot to do with it. Playing Persona has given me an advanced understanding of Japanese society. Now excuse me while I take my weekly shower
[2:44:08] <jj61794> I forget since I only guard during Desperation attacks, does guarding keep enemies from knocking you down?
[2:44:19] <Anger_Panda> XPPs
[2:44:23] <%optimasmaximas> treasure personas?
[2:44:28] <COMB711> arkahm sona 5
[2:44:31] <%bigunclebungus> i wish you could change it so mona would stop sucking joker off after every move
[2:44:33] <clintonificent> I realize that I'm basically just becoming the save point dialogue from Barkley Shut Up and Jam Gaiden
[2:44:35] <xeros720> yeah, guard blocks your weakness
[2:44:42] <Tiewolf> So what would win, Persona's or Stands in a battle?
[2:44:52] <clintonificent> stands
[2:44:58] <xeros720> it only lasts for one attack though
[2:44:59] <bxdragon> Same
[2:45:01] <%Dragon_Batman> Yep
[2:45:03] <Ashecroft> Stands
[2:45:04] <%trustycoyote> Same
[2:45:04] <+BubbaRands> YUP YUP YUP
[2:45:06] <%optimasmaximas> @Tiewolf stands for wacky zaney bs LUL
[2:45:06] <%Dr00_PhD> Thats the method
[2:45:07] <clintonificent> Satanael can't reset actions to zero
[2:45:07] <+LandOfTheWay> exactly
[2:45:07] <+thelonechris> Is that persona a piss droplet?
[2:45:07] <%republicofu> same
[2:45:08] <MonstarGrrrl> would you fuck a persona ?
[2:45:08] <Kraegeth> exactly that
[2:45:09] <COMB711> that's the way
[2:45:10] <stealinmckillen> ye
[2:45:11] <+chaggles> yup
[2:45:13] <%Dragon_Batman> Either do both at the same time or just do that
[2:45:16] <%optimasmaximas> ye
[2:45:18] <$lotharrio> That's a pretty good way to do it.
[2:45:18] <%spiritofmojave> That's the idea
[2:45:24] <zenith0111> @tiewolf Well they work on entirely different ways. ut stands can be used anywhere when personas cannot. So stands win by default
[2:45:24] <+Brickston> I always try to have a couple of strong personas of a type I'm focusing on increasing
[2:45:27] <+mem3_jesus> I totally forgot about matching Personas and S-Links. FUCK
[2:45:28] <megaman_sentinel> yea same
[2:45:34] <+fgcmorad> But you don't get the S link bonus XP
[2:45:39] <%Flambage> @PatStaresAt What is the best way to gain guts?
[2:45:39] <+pectusumbra> You can get that knight now
[2:45:41] <%Dr00_PhD> Make attack magic and suppport then slink personas
[2:45:43] <+fgcmorad> better wa
[2:45:44] <timetraveller2000> @patstaresat I just fuse any combo I can find in the palace then regret my life choices when the boss comes Kappa Kappa
[2:45:44] <clintonificent> some personas would beat some low level Stands but like big strong Stands like villain/protagonist stands stomp Personas everyday
[2:45:45] <globalGinnicide> How much has Royal been different from the original so far? I havent seen anything P5 since i beat it when it first came out
[2:45:45] <+Brickston> I basically use the archive just to fill in the gaps when fusing persona
[2:46:09] <%hawk_rush> I forgot that the first palace is super long
[2:46:15] <clintonificent> the battle game
[2:46:16] <zenith0111> @clintonificent Your comment is basically "they stronger one would win"
[2:46:20] <%optimasmaximas> friendship is STRONGER
[2:46:20] <+teg88> Is Ohya's SL any better?
[2:46:22] <zeif00> Yeah you get way better returns from the confidants
[2:46:24] <megaman_sentinel> yea
[2:46:27] <timetraveller2000> @hawk_rush Pats about halfway from what I remember
[2:46:36] <%trustycoyote> Social is time limited while battle progress is not. I agree
[2:46:36] <%arancet> @teg88 a little, but still meh
[2:46:38] <clintonificent> does your social style match your battle style
[2:46:42] <Meekest> Hopefully they improved THAT ONE PALACE
[2:46:46] <+PrincessLuna85> hey chat anyone playing p5r at the casino willing to send me a pm? i cant find the red skull and would like help
[2:46:47] <+Daniel_Is_I> 120 hours in P5 and I didn't know persona arcana gave confidant points to that arcana...
[2:46:47] <Valentinius_Anodyne> Friendship is the means through which all is revealed
[2:46:49] <COMB711> It's way more important for your party to have harisen recovery than it is to have like 2 levels
[2:46:49] <clintonificent> and do they match your death style
[2:46:52] <+Brickston> it may have just been a while since I played it but it seems like they tweaked the combat animations
[2:46:54] <OldManDeckardCain> yep
[2:47:02] <%hawk_rush> @timetraveller2000 damn, only about halfway
[2:47:05] <%optimasmaximas> @Meekest psst.....you talkin bout okumara?
[2:47:14] <clintonificent> does this game have the best UI ever?
[2:47:16] <%Flambage> @PatStaresAt What is the best way to gain guts in this one?
[2:47:17] <+pectusumbra> It's not, promise
[2:47:18] <%miguelrod777> Sp
[2:47:20] <%optimasmaximas> uses SP
[2:47:23] <+pectusumbra> It uses SP first
[2:47:24] <%BallerSwagBro9k> psaGoblin
[2:47:25] <timetraveller2000> @hawk_rush yep, this Palace is a hell of an opener NotLikeThis
[2:47:28] <%Ascethetic> @PatStaresAt it uses the SP needed to fully heal
[2:47:29] <Meekest> @optimasmaximas "We're halfway through the dungeon!" *two hours later* "We're halfway through the dungeon!" NotLikeThis
[2:47:33] <%Aleate> Borger?

[2:48:05] <theloganbrand> Go do the grappels
[2:48:06] <%GarbageNirvana> There's basically no reason to play the original now
[2:48:06] <clintonificent> yeyeyeyeye new content
[2:48:09] <+SlumberMan> Did I just see the Hogyoku?
[2:48:15] <%Slayer875> You can use the school library during this palace for a bit of guts
[2:48:16] <+mem3_jesus> The burg challenge, if you've got to Shinjuku already you can watch the "Like a Dragon" movie at the theater there
[2:48:17] <%Dragon_Batman> Twitch shure is great for that
[2:48:18] <%angel949> can confirm its wild
[2:48:19] <zenith0111> I hate the social stats. I would honestly love this game if they took out that arbitrary mechanic
[2:48:19] <+PrincessLuna85> @Flambage big bang burger reading and studying in library when its noisy as well as certain confidants will all increase it
[2:48:21] <%optimasmaximas> @GarbageNirvana well royal isn't canon so
[2:48:24] <%moogleboy1984> Persona; the Patient Gamers champion series
[2:48:24] <%hawk_rush> stands are such bs lol
[2:48:24] <cdev57> missed the grapple for a cool 5 sec scene
[2:48:30] <clintonificent> OH SHTI YOUR RIGHT
[2:48:30] <%MaddyCaddy> That's not true

[2:48:34] <TomFrank> @PatStaresAt did you like the re3 remake? :)
[2:48:34] <%shaidot> Will Seed here!!
[2:48:36] <+Brickston> if so Stands are way way way better
[2:48:38] <%JohnAtDawn> Nah headcanon says fuck that
[2:48:42] <%FacetiousAF> treeeezhur
[2:48:43] <clintonificent> wait some Personas can step outside
[2:48:43] <%optimasmaximas> psaBig secret
[2:48:43] <%MaddyCaddy> In Persona 1 and 2 they could summon them at any time
[2:48:44] <Jeemukun> counter point, Demons vs. Stands
[2:48:44] <Aydarkzero> the Stand is your soul and you take that everywhere
[2:48:45] <%Dragon_Batman> I do like how they evolve as you mature
[2:48:45] <+jjjkopf> laughs in persona 1 & 2
[2:48:46] <%Aleate> Amazing
[2:48:47] <%AncelDeLambert> that's okay, Stands aren't available outside of fiction either
[2:48:48] <+Brickston> only a Stand can damage another Stand
[2:48:48] <clintonificent> yeah P1 and P2
[2:48:49] <aeonicvector> Persona 1/2 disagrees, as does p4 fishing that said stands STILL win out overall
[2:48:50] <grimmthereeper> If I already have persona 5 but have not beat it should I buy this game or should continue with the original?
[2:48:52] <%FacetiousAF> short cut???
[2:48:52] <tacoisgoods> alternate route
[2:48:53] <shiny_prinny> only in p1 and 2 are they everywhere
[2:48:54] <%Dr00_PhD> Thats where you would have grappled to
[2:48:54] <theloganbrand> Do the grapple points
[2:48:55] <+LandOfTheWay> @PatStaresAt persona users can use their personas in the real world if they're strong enough
[2:48:56] <%Klefth> Another seed?
[2:48:56] <%bread_assassin> You could've zipped up here as a short cut.
[2:48:57] <%spiritofmojave> P1 and 2 do in fact exist
[2:48:58] <$lotharrio> I guess that's maybe true? You don't have access to your Persona's powers in P3 and later games, unless you're in dungeons.
[2:48:59] <clintonificent> Also in P1 and P2 EVERYONE is wild cards
[2:49:00] <%nilla_24> you can use the hook from downstairs
[2:49:02] <shevan123> i just want a persona game where the demi fiend shows up
[2:49:02] <chocolate_matter> Big burger, doctor tests, studying in the library early on, getting coffee in shibuya cafe, and books to get guts.
[2:49:04] <twoto858> Cool grapple scene that you missed
[2:49:04] <%Rumbutt> If you grapple up out of the fuck zone that's where you land
[2:49:05] <+fgcmorad> Persona 1 and 2 don't exist guys
[2:49:06] <+Daniel_Is_I> I kinda want P6 to have a lot of personas mucking about in reality
[2:49:06] <%shaidot> If you use grappling hook you end up there
[2:49:08] <+Brickston> Only a Stand can defeat another Stand
[2:49:11] <Japanfreak2595> Imagine if Persona’s had stand abilities
[2:49:12] <Valentinius_Anodyne> As always, Persona 1&2 are victorious B)
[2:49:16] <%rumtumtugnutz> there was a jojo reference in a bon appetit video yesterday.
[2:49:16] <%nilla_24> it's cool
[2:49:17] <CurrySauseBandit> So we're saying that Persona like Alice and Thor wouldn't dumpster most stands?
[2:49:19] <%JohnAtDawn> You can totally use Personas in the real world because otherwise the universe is infinitely more boring.
[2:49:19] <timetraveller2000> Re3 remake was good but felt really short
[2:49:22] <%optimasmaximas> @PatStaresAt last night max said he'd rather play RE5
[2:49:23] <+pectusumbra> I think there's a grapple point you walked past down there as well
[2:49:25] <Darakoi> grappling hook shortcut
[2:49:29] <%BallerSwagBro9k> @patstaresat Did u see the final FF7 trailer?
[2:49:35] <$Corporate_Redeemer> Stands win cuz of shit like GER, D4C, time stop, KC, and World Over Heaven
[2:49:35] <%hawk_rush> i'll be finishing up the RE3 remake tonight
[2:49:35] <zenith0111> But wasn't P1 and P2 in like some fucked version of the real world where their reality was being warped?
[2:49:39] <%hawk_rush> it's pretty fun so far
[2:49:48] <%hawk_rush> But I'm leaning towards RE2 more
[2:49:48] <clintonificent> RE3 is the Ground Zeroes of RE, its really good but maybe not worth the $60
[2:49:58] <clintonificent> its not nearly as short as Ground Zeroes obviously lmao
[2:50:00] <KingRipoff1> as long as you have an evoker from p3 you can summon your persona whenever
[2:50:01] <%rumtumtugnutz> @BallerSwagBro9k You mean the BIG SPOILER TRAILER?
[2:50:05] <+Brickston> @Corporate_Redeemer I don't think a single stand user would lose to all of the Persona crews at once
[2:50:13] <Eger007> speedrun
[2:50:20] <timetraveller2000> @hawk_rush I just did my first S run and got the no health items used achievement, was way easier than you’d think
[2:50:20] <%optimasmaximas> @zenith0111 not sure, but i do know that in one of them you kill god with a big g and in the other you fight hitler
[2:50:21] <+LandOfTheWay> @zenith0111 yes, but p4a established that you CAN use a persona in the real world, it's just really tough, and p1 and p2 imply as much
[2:50:22] <arcanemacrocosm> to teach people to keep an eye on the environment?
[2:50:23] <aubrea> wtf is this new?
[2:50:27] <+0c310t> Does any of your P5 progress carry over?
[2:50:29] <+Brickston> even just tower would rip them to shreds
[2:50:31] <zenith0111> Also most Persona users are not pro fighters so... it's one sided af
[2:50:33] <clintonificent> i think it should have been a $30-40 expansion pack for RE2 remake, or given more time to really flesh out the game
[2:50:34] <%AncelDeLambert> apparently Joker can turn into a Samus ball
[2:50:34] <Lucasleonava> go up
[2:50:35] <Leaferson> How're you liking Royal so far?
[2:50:35] <%spiritofmojave> Kinda glad I didn't pick RE3 up, much as I love Jill/story shit they imrpoved on. 60$ is a bit much
[2:50:37] <+RogueMinja> Gotta explore all the things.
[2:50:38] <%shaidot> go back!
[2:50:39] <%nilla_24> come back
[2:50:43] <+Arkfyre> there's a grapple
[2:50:43] <%strugglepunk2> go back
[2:50:44] <Lucasleonava> back
[2:50:45] <+Arkfyre> go back
[2:50:45] <theloganbrand> Grappel by chest
[2:50:46] <%strugglepunk2> grapple
[2:50:46] <Berendenn> lots of stand users would lose to persona users, like avdol instantly losing to anyone with fire absorb
[2:50:46] <+fgcmorad> There's more
[2:50:46] <%nilla_24> BACK
[2:50:47] <aeonicvector> @Brickston Literally any null phys persona VS Silver Chariot
[2:50:47] <TDAWS_MP132> there was another grapple point!
[2:50:48] <usurper_sos> Grapple
[2:50:48] <tacoisgoods> grappling point back
[2:50:48] <+Katohearts> grapple point by the chest
[2:50:50] <%OblivionSword1> there's a grapple point near the chestä
[2:50:51] <+mem3_jesus> Grapple at the curse magatama chest
[2:50:51] <+enigmaticgear> keep going
[2:50:55] <COMB711> wow they really switched this dungeon up in this half, thank god it was poopy garbage in the original
[2:50:55] <timetraveller2000> @landoftheway what is the logic behind using Personas in reality? I forget
[2:50:55] <SnakeVash> Yeah, i don't want to play FFVIIR anymore.
[2:50:56] <%optimasmaximas> @0c310t you get free dlc items if you have a save from P5 vanilla
[2:51:01] <+enigmaticgear> will seed
[2:51:07] <%ShichiNoBushi> Seeing eye chat.
[2:51:07] <+Taglog7> sipsipSipsipblind
[2:51:09] <CurrySauseBandit> @zenith0111 IIRC, technically we're in the "fucked" version. As the first was like, destroyed or whatever. Been ages since i've been in that loop.
[2:51:13] <zenith0111> @berendenn But that's usually because they are also fire
[2:51:14] <reddpop_> runs in the family
[2:51:19] <%GabeSweetMan> BEHELIT
[2:51:20] <crowfox> Never played P5 but at this point I think I'll wait to pick this up until after FF7
[2:51:21] <%Meltdown547> Resorted to helping Pat with his blindness, as Paige is a ost cause.
[2:51:25] <+mem3_jesus> If anything the grappling hook is just a better less interactive grim grip mechanic
[2:51:25] <Onamar> Seeds Kreygasm
[2:51:26] <+NitronStreams> Eat it
[2:51:27] <+Brickston> @aeonicvector and then Joker was burned alive when the rapier was put in fire
[2:51:27] <Berendenn> or silver chariot losing to anyone with physical absorb
[2:51:27] <ScreamLord> @PatStaresAt If Persona's had infinite availability like Stands which would be stronger?
[2:51:31] <bleugh> this game has bamham mechanics huh
[2:51:34] <clintonificent> i'm worried FF7R is going to be like Phantom Pain where you see everything cool in the trailers
[2:51:35] <+LandOfTheWay> @timetraveller2000 not super clear, but basically they're just harder to manifest in normal reality as opposed to magic ones cause of ambient magic
[2:51:35] <+RogueMinja> A grorb.
[2:51:36] <Charronia> More Kamoshida seed
[2:51:36] <Jakeofalco> Did they remix the dungeons ?
[2:51:37] <+Arkfyre> it's a spooky potato
[2:51:37] <%Typhaeon> Very uterine pedestal it's on
[2:51:38] <+love_otter> Looks more like a mandrake than anything else
[2:51:39] <%shurtal> So what you're saying is, Kamoshida did nothing wrong?
[2:51:42] <%KaiserMario> RGB seeds
[2:51:42] <Tiewolf> it looks like that Screaming Plaint
[2:51:43] <$Corporate_Redeemer> GORB
[2:51:44] <%hawk_rush> @Jakeofalco kind of yeah
[2:51:47] <timetraveller2000> I don’t like that voice the seed is using DansGame
[2:51:47] <%hawk_rush> new areas
[2:51:50] <%nilla_24> final fantasy jump
[2:51:51] <%GabeSweetMan> ANKLES SHATTERED
[2:51:51] <%LaughingCatt> dont worry about it
[2:51:56] <%spiritofmojave> Sacrifice your social links for more time on the clock!
[2:51:56] <clintonificent> thats a JUMP
[2:51:59] <%ShichiNoBushi> AH! My legs!
[2:52:00] <%startstoprepeat> ryuji went from "i'm not sure about this" to "hell yeah second one down" quickly
[2:52:02] <+Brickston> @shurtal he was just trying to teach his students about the real world
[2:52:02] <clintonificent> Do Air Raid

[2:52:36] <+vampireinarm> make the funny noises stream man
[2:52:39] <%rumtumtugnutz> Your mom is a saxophone.
[2:52:39] <Charronia> The stank is getting stronger
[2:52:41] <%strugglepunk2> new collectable @purplethirst
[2:52:41] <+Brickston> because stands are broken and if you don't have one you can't see or youch them
[2:52:44] <%optimasmaximas> Kreygasm
[2:52:45] <%arancet> @purplethirst new item, collect 3 in a palace to get a special item

[2:52:53] <%TheOneCalledRock> hi everyone. how are you doing today?
[2:52:54] <%Rumbutt> IT'S THE WOOLIE ZONE
[2:52:54] <TioXyco> tiddy room, huh?
[2:52:54] <%strugglepunk2> Three per dungeon does something pat hasn't figured out yet
[2:52:54] <%DakotaMacDoodle> you jnoq the one
[2:53:00] <+fgcmorad> A trep
[2:53:02] <+LandOfTheWay> @PatStaresAt you got a favorite demon/persona?
[2:53:05] <@commanderclaw> The booty parlor is the most important room
[2:53:06] <clintonificent> so early on in P5's announcement cycle, I remember theories that you would turn into your Personas because of that one scene where Joker's eyes go all yellow and Persona-y, and I kinda wish that was in the game as like a form of Limit Break or something
[2:53:09] <+linSP> ass vator
[2:53:10] <+Brickston> @Rumbutt how can it be the Woolie zone, there's no trash here
[2:53:10] <+HauteTactique> SourPls

[2:53:14] <%Dragon_Batman> Doing good, you? @TheOneCalledRock
[2:53:17] <timetraveller2000> @patstaresat 1,492 to be precise :) you’re so popular
[2:53:24] <%optimasmaximas> it's the portait passage right?
[2:53:26] <zenith0111> Did you guys know that Stands were referred to as "Ghost Hamon"m
[2:53:30] <+knowyourenemy_97> The lair of the piller man, Kamosida
[2:53:31] <Tiewolf> like those clothes were added on
[2:53:32] <%FacetiousAF> entryway??
[2:53:33] <+Brickston> Bowser noises intensify
[2:53:34] <clintonificent> like Ryuji once his Limit Break meter goes full he can transform into Captain Kidd or something

[2:53:52] <%FacetiousAF> foy-yerrrr
[2:53:52] <%strugglepunk2> @MaddyCaddy LMAO
[2:54:03] <aeonicvector> Not really, Personas presumably opperate on stand logic, otherwise silver chariot couldnt see god himself crushing him while his sword bounces off @Brickston
[2:54:04] <+ChrisAlgoo> it's like a dark souls
[2:54:11] <TioXyco> tis a trap
[2:54:14] <godlesscruelty> Corona virus must be hittin life hard to be streaming this early
[2:54:35] <+Brickston> @aeonicvector well thats the question, can personas be seen by normal people and be effected by normal physical objects
[2:54:35] <SnakeVash> Shortcut porn is some of the Best
[2:54:36] <timetraveller2000> @godlesscruelty implying Pat has a social life Kappa
[2:54:40] <+Brickston> and the answer seems to be they can
[2:54:42] <godlesscruelty> ooOOoo
[2:54:46] <zenith0111> Persona Users fight god... but Stand Userd can BECOME GODS.
[2:54:48] <aeonicvector> @Brickston can influence, cant be seen, see p3

[2:55:13] <%optimasmaximas> @zenith0111 by that logic persona users ould then still beat stand users
[2:55:13] <clintonificent> SBR is the best because it more or less equally focuses on Spin (the Hamon equivalent) and Stands
[2:55:14] <%Dragon_Batman> This one is guarded eh

[2:59:47] <+JonThePrettyOKGuy> Diarama. niiice
[2:59:50] <mechengineers> super nope
[2:59:50] <+Brickston> So yeah they just assume if you're playing this you beat P5 and want to rush this shit
[2:59:51] <Ubu2933> that's "nut"
[2:59:51] <zenith0111> It's weird because the "gods" in persona aren't the real things but they are at the same time...
[2:59:55] <$lotharrio> That's the sort of balancing I love.
[2:59:56] <%optimasmaximas> @zenith0111 yeah? but you're still trying to put them in a matchup... so the fact remains that that logic allows persona users to still kill gods/beat stand users that become god; im of the mindset that stand users would win anyway, but from what you've said it seems you disagree?
[2:59:56] <%suikudo> Diarama in dungeon 1 is pretty fucking good
[2:59:59] <+tigerfang86> yeah Ryuji isn't gonna be casting or anything
[3:00:02] <+Brickston> because Diarama on all persona in dungeon 1...

[3:12:01] <zenith0111> Seeing what the best possible personas have to do is so not what i expecting.
[3:12:01] <timetraveller2000> @jackythefrost I wouldn’t mind a remake of 2 tbh
[3:12:05] <%jackythefrost> even though P2 is the best persona game narratively
[3:12:08] <JumbleJams> @jackythefrost they remember enough to give us a costume and that's it
[3:12:09] <%weissguard> Riiiiiiiiight.
[3:12:10] <zenith0111> Just make them really good at one move

[3:12:26] <%Maids4lyfe> P2 is great because you can kill Hitler

[3:13:17] <%Reveresao> psaFist_SG
[3:13:18] <YakumoYomi> @timetraveller2000 They're probably not interested in remaking P2 (since they technically already did that on PSP), and I heard it wasn't received well.
[3:13:19] <Bailey__gaming> I have regular. p5 on ps4 I kinda bounced off it as I didn't understand the systems I probably should try again
[3:13:24] <%BonewheelVanguard> Came in late, what I miss?

[3:37:22] <YakumoYomi> Kamoshida's gotta go.
[3:37:22] <+Arbal3st> Yes all the palaces are based on the 7 Deadly Sins
[3:37:25] <Eger007> kinda
[3:37:26] <+JonThePrettyOKGuy> It's very explicit
[3:37:26] <+UltraViolet371> Swindler of Progress
[3:37:26] <tacoisgoods> gluttony
[3:37:26] <%dukenux> If there's 7 of them
[3:37:27] <%kyh9> Sloth is Yaldaboth
[3:37:27] <%stagemage> they are, then it kinda looses the lead
[3:37:28] <%Aleate> The trophies LITERALLY say their sins...
[3:37:28] <$lotharrio> Pride is in there.
[3:37:29] <%FacetiousAF> what's haru's dad??
[3:37:29] <aeonicvector> Artist is envy
[3:37:30] <+evbites> wrath?
[3:37:31] <smilemychild> RE3 is awesome, but I wish it was longer. its like, it has the potential to be as good as RE4, cuz they both follow the same style of gameplay, but RE4 is wayyyy longer
[3:37:31] <$iaraCatunda> gluttony
[3:37:31] <timetraveller2000> Imagine Kamoshida as a Party member. Yikes DansGame
[3:37:32] <DRAGKUDO> gnostic 9 deadly sins
[3:37:33] <+kralec> Seven deadly sins
[3:37:33] <Ubu2933> yeah they do match up don't they

[3:37:42] <%valriot> You need 7 Sins to do THE THING
[3:37:44] <+Jp3g95> Asmodeus
[3:37:45] <%joe_bagadou_nautz> Half the sins are just different versions of greed
[3:37:46] <%shaidot> I don't know why the game tries to pass it off as sexual harassment when its clearly rape
[3:37:47] <%genowyn> Lust-Vanity-Gluttony-Wrath-Greed-Envy-Pride in dungeon order
[3:37:47] <%StaceMcGate> SECONDARY
[3:37:51] <%FacetiousAF> @SlumberMan wait then what's makoto's boss???

[3:38:01] <Valentinius_Anodyne> Yes
[3:38:03] <%Keyd00d> Atlus is a bunch of fucks
[3:38:05] <%supergoblinpunch> Madarama is Envy
[3:38:05] <%kyh9> It also has the best new party member
[3:38:06] <Aydarkzero> a sequel?
[3:38:07] <zenith0111> Saying they're "Based off sins" is so generic and easy to put into anything even if it wasn't it's focus
[3:38:09] <+pectusumbra> Lust, vanity, greed, sloth/despair,
[3:38:09] <+SlumberMan> @FacetiousAF Gluttony. He's a fly.
[3:38:09] <clintonificent> @timetraveller2000 Gammas are great, and Drain Deimos, which were originally just licker-chimera hybrid clones in the original, are EXTREMELY creepy. They have fucking human faces - look at em in Model Viewer
[3:38:10] <%ape_hawk> persona 5-2
[3:38:11] <ItIsSky> You could technically play this on a vita

[3:38:17] <+TheBigO75> Stfu!
[3:38:17] <%Hellarussian> hi Atlas
[3:38:17] <+Brickston> @shaidot it's only clear if you're familiar with that kind of plot in japanese media, and I don't think that really plays well to a western audience. It's a good change
[3:38:19] <%Wallabri> they're Kingdom Heartsing
[3:38:19] <%dukenux> Stop making sense Paige
[3:38:19] <bigstupidjellyfish1337> Atlus is evil

[3:38:36] <Valentinius_Anodyne> Also Scramble's apparently not getting a Western release?
[3:38:37] <%spiritofmojave> John Marketing is watching
[3:38:37] <%cherrycottontail> The people in Atlus who are annoying are not the ones who know english
[3:38:37] <%ape_hawk> THIS IS ATLUS: Come out with your waifus up!

[3:38:46] <Dr_Mooose> LUL
[3:38:46] <%kyh9> Atlus doesn't actually have that many Switch devs
[3:38:46] <+ZoltanBMagnus> Bidet NOISE
[3:38:46] <$lotharrio> Atlus is trying to watch this on their fax machines and beepers AS WE SPEAK.
[3:38:46] <Retinolgaming> HOW CAN THEY BE WATCHING FROM THE YEAR 1994?!

[3:39:00] <nolzee> almost like Persona games play really well on handlheld
[3:39:01] <%dukenux> Vita means 25 to LIFE
[3:39:03] <%SoFarFetched> Country Bumpkin's are great though
[3:39:03] <+Brickston> "Stuck in the Vita jail" just means "For Free on PC BehBEE"
[3:39:04] <timbroome> P3P best boi
[3:39:05] <%foreverN2dust> Inaba makes me miss Japan
[3:39:06] <zeif00> Inaba was fun
[3:39:06] <ItIsSky> Persona 4 Dancing got out of Vita hell before Golden
[3:39:06] <%GabeSweetMan> Inaba is still my favorite persona location.
[3:39:08] <clintonificent> P4G is better than P5 Vanilla imo, but P5R looks like its better with the new content I've watched
[3:39:08] <$iaraCatunda> that was a lowkey anime girl moan
[3:39:09] <tacostarvedbeast> Does Paige know how to ride a horse?

[3:39:16] <+Daniel_Is_I> Classic giant pendulum axes
[3:39:18] <%dukenux> clasiic Alan Poe
[3:39:18] <YakumoYomi> P5R apparently had disappointing sales in Japan...which is a no-brainer to everyone, because the PS4 sold like shit in Japan
[3:39:19] <%King_Wolf_Rigger> HAve you ever had a tomahawk steak?
[3:39:20] <%WhereIsWill> my bad sens fortress?!
[3:39:23] <%Dementedpenguin> It turned into a Deception game
[3:39:23] <%Jickiechan> the vita is just the metal gear and persona machine
[3:39:23] <DexteraXIII> P2: Best Plot P3: Best Theming P4: Best Characters P5: Best Gameplay
[3:39:23] <mistersups> welcome to the HOUSE OF FUN!
[3:39:25] <%optimasmaximas> @ItIsSky dont remind me FeelsBadMan
[3:39:25] <JehutyVer2> Watch out for the Man-Serpents
[3:39:30] <GarbageQueenEllie> Glad I got to June in the game so I can watch spoiler free
[3:39:35] <%KaiserMario> What is this place? Sen's Fortress? har har har
[3:39:37] <%ShichiNoBushi> That jaw...
[3:39:43] <%Keyd00d> 3 characters are better
[3:39:45] <timetraveller2000> P4G is so upbeat compared to 3 and 5
[3:39:46] <SnakeVash> ATLUS NEEDS TO BRING THAT EVA-NIER MECHA GAME OVER
[3:39:52] <Charronia> "We don't have the key" naroDerp
[3:39:55] <clintonificent> P2 has incredible plot and characters, especially because its only 5 party members so they really just focus super hard on those 5
[3:39:58] <rickaay15> that what now
[3:40:03] <+pectusumbra> This is actually where I got my first game over in the original
[3:40:03] <+JonThePrettyOKGuy> Beat up Horsedudes until you get it
[3:40:04] <saiyan24675> Wait is P5S going to be Switch Exclusive
[3:40:04] <+neonNeptunian> eva-nier mecha game WHAT
[3:40:08] <%KaiserMario> Is Persona 5 the Dark Souls of JRPGs?
[3:40:09] <%optimasmaximas> @timetraveller2000 even for itself considering it's all about murder lol
[3:40:09] <GarbageQueenEllie> Yeah but I LOVE it tho
[3:40:11] <nolzee> For how dark it is
[3:40:11] <%Keyd00d> wait what
[3:40:12] <%Dragon_Batman> Yea it is specially coming off of 3
[3:40:15] <%Manjove> how
[3:40:20] <MikeNized> The fsteaks are not that high.
[3:40:21] <+SlumberMan> P4 is literally just a bunch of friends solving a small town mystery.
[3:40:24] <shiny_prinny> the fsteaks
[3:40:24] <+fgcmorad> To its benefits, so many gloomy RPGs already
[3:40:26] <%Rumbutt> P4 is upbeat cause they had to compensate for P3
[3:40:27] <+Brickston> The stakes don't feel as high but if you think about them it's higher in 4
[3:40:27] <%spiritofmojave> True P4 is pretty grounded next to 3 and 5
[3:40:27] <%kyh9> Yeah
[3:40:27] <+justianxix> Its just scoopy doo in the hicks
[3:40:28] <cdev57> ooohhh thieves den points
[3:40:28] <%DesuDesuDokiDoki> yes
[3:40:28] <Manmadeawesome> p4 has BIG tonal dissonance
[3:40:28] <%foreverN2dust> @SnakeVash what game are you referring to? the vanillaware game?
[3:40:28] <%King_Wolf_Rigger> I do
[3:40:28] <Dr_Mooose> ye
[3:40:30] <%Keyd00d> Except for y'know all the people dying
[3:40:30] <clintonificent> its a game of extremes, its simultaneously the most upbeat and the most grim one
[3:40:31] <gekizenbu> scooby doo but with murder
[3:40:31] <Treuan> rooby rooby roo
[3:40:32] <%zamzoph> wren't people being murdered in P4?
[3:40:32] <+UltraViolet371> that sounds fun
[3:40:33] <GarbageQueenEllie> I also love Scooby Doo
[3:40:33] <+Gutsandlove> ye
[3:40:34] <%miguelrod777> yeah shames it's dead
[3:40:34] <%biomegabear> 4 is scooby doo and 5 is KND
[3:40:34] <+neonNeptunian> fsteak
[3:40:34] <%ShichiNoBushi> Serial murderer is a bit less serious than end of the world.
[3:40:35] <+Qsmash_> P3 is more of my vibe
[3:40:35] <Kraegeth> everone lieks scooby
[3:40:35] <UnderpaidBob> P3 is so gloomy my god
[3:40:36] <+Jp3g95> :meat:
[3:40:36] <GuardMeShielder> Scooby Doo is great
[3:40:37] <%stagemage> the stakes are secretly amazingly high
[3:40:37] <%shiplord13> Yep
[3:40:39] <+megaotter> hello my dear my name is Kenpachi Ramasoma
[3:40:39] <%NovaKnightmare> 4>3>5
[3:40:40] <nolzee> A small town mystery serial killer
[3:40:41] <+Brickston> If you fail in 4 someone dies and then the whole town/world gets consumed by the fog
[3:40:41] <%kyh9> 3 is about the inevitability of death
[3:40:41] <UnderpaidBob> I love P3 tho
[3:40:43] <+Taglog7> Steaks heh heh
[3:40:43] <SnakeVash> YEAH EVA-NIER MECHA GAME
[3:40:44] <Sol_Install> that depends, which scooby doo?
[3:40:44] <crovvv> I really wish 4 was on the ps4
[3:40:44] <smilemychild> p3 is depressing as fuck
[3:40:44] <+Jp3g95> 🥩
[3:40:47] <fateirony> P3 BEST
[3:40:47] <tmix1600> 3 IS DARK
[3:40:47] <%around_40_jobbers> 3 has a dude shot by jesus
[3:40:48] <NickelCanvas> P3 is Buffy, P4 is Scooby, P5 ADULT TIMES
[3:40:48] <%GarbageNirvana> And P5 is Joker's trick
[3:40:48] <%Dragon_Batman> I really liked how 3 was so heavy
[3:40:48] <%lightsout177> @chat does the new girl get her own dungeon run
[3:40:48] <%king_wragles> @PatStaresAt in P4 you can stop the bad stuff from happening, in P5 you're reacting to the nefarious shit that's already happened
[3:40:48] <+neonNeptunian> the hiimdaisy dub is a classic
[3:40:49] <%majindusto> Well you know, besides the "murders"
[3:40:52] <clintonificent> its a game that deals with pure evil, killing people just for the fun of it which is super dark
[3:40:53] <%optimasmaximas> nope
[3:40:54] <Sol_Install> also P5 > P3 >P4
[3:40:54] <heartlesshealer> no
[3:40:55] <%republicofu> 3 is also less personal
[3:40:56] <%Keyd00d> what
[3:40:57] <nolzee> I never remember a serial killer being kinda now big deal
[3:40:58] <+JonThePrettyOKGuy> p5 is a nice middleground of depression I think
[3:40:58] <%kyh9> Persona Q2 on 3DS
[3:40:58] <UnderpaidBob> old battle theme?
[3:40:59] <DexteraXIII> Literally every single aspect of P3 is screaming at you that you will die some day.
[3:40:59] <MKUltima> Memento Mori - Remember this game will fucking kill you emotionally
[3:40:59] <Blank9> nope
[3:41:00] <%WhereIsWill> PS2PRO

[3:41:02] <tmix1600> No
[3:41:04] <$lotharrio> Vita means life. Don't give up on life.
[3:41:05] <+Daniel_Is_I> They need to remaster P3Fes and P4G for the PS5
[3:41:06] <ScreamLord> Sun God Sown
[3:41:07] <ItIsSky> PSTV

[3:41:10] <MSN04_Sazabi> Week 2 of Paige without drugs
[3:41:10] <@commanderclaw> You can't play Persona on modern devices
[3:41:11] <shiny_prinny> Persona 1-4 on ps3 that's about it
[3:41:11] <%Calek> Emulation!

[3:41:14] <zeif00> I played p3p on my phone *shhh*
[3:41:15] <$lotharrio> Sun is UP, Paige. You'll be fine.
[3:41:15] <TioXyco> PSP emulation
[3:41:15] <UnderpaidBob> ps2
[3:41:16] <Sol_Install> nope
[3:41:16] <%kyh9> Hack your Switch, cowards
[3:41:17] <YakumoYomi> P3= Inevitability of death, P4= Accept yourself, P5= Rebel against corrupt society (but not too hard)
[3:41:17] <tacoisgoods> I feel that P5 has the best balance between upbeat and serious
[3:41:18] <timbroome> Emulate the shit out of it
[3:41:18] <Kraegeth> psx
[3:41:18] <%Dragon_Batman> Ppsspp
[3:41:19] <+JonThePrettyOKGuy> psp emulator
[3:41:20] <GarbageQueenEllie> So who is Bobby gonna try to smash in this runthrough?
[3:41:20] <%foreverN2dust> @SnakeVash I don't see what it has in common with either of those series outside of having a mech
[3:41:22] <smilemychild> PCSX2
[3:41:22] <TioXyco> PPSSPP
[3:41:23] <MSN04_Sazabi> PSP emulates even on Android
[3:41:24] <+Brickston> PCSX2 behbee
[3:41:25] <usurper_sos> ????
[3:41:25] <%Zebroneath> You can play P3 FES on PS3
[3:41:25] <%WhereIsWill> PCSX2
[3:41:26] <Jeemukun> they're all on the ps3 i think
[3:41:26] <%Keyd00d> Why aren't P1 and P2 remade yet
[3:41:27] <KingRipoff1> you can do both psp and ps2 emulation
[3:41:27] <%spiritofmojave> PCSX2
[3:41:29] <ovan20> @PatStaresAt you can emulate P4 too
[3:41:29] <+Taglog7> There's Q
[3:41:30] <heartlesshealer> ps3 is still ps2 emulation
[3:41:31] <%ConLin_Arts_> Pee Pee Sss Sss Pee Pee
[3:41:32] <Valentinius_Anodyne> They emulate pretty good
[3:41:32] <+Jp3g95> P3P Vita
[3:41:32] <%DesuDesuDokiDoki> sorry
[3:41:33] <+pectusumbra> be nice
[3:41:33] <rentumspoons> you can play p3 on your phone
[3:41:34] <Arccun> PPSSPP or PCSX2
[3:41:35] <%Nobrev> you can get them all on a Vita @patstaresat
[3:41:38] <smilemychild> thats a hot succubus
[3:41:39] <+Fireside_Stories> playstation TV if you want on TV
[3:41:40] <shiny_prinny> Persona 1-4 are on the PS3
[3:41:42] <+knowyourenemy_97> P5 is if p3 and p4 did a fusion dance
[3:41:46] <clintonificent> also yellow isn't just the theme because happiness, its also a color associated with fear and anxiety. I think its the dichotomy between the upbeat and dark that characterizes P4G, not necessarily the upbeatness by itself if that makes sense
[3:41:47] <%Keyd00d> I dunno lol
[3:41:48] <Meekest> Yes
[3:41:48] <+bharcoot> 3
[3:41:49] <+love_otter> yh
[3:41:50] <%Engwithan_Elder_God> ?
[3:41:51] <%Agami23> p3fes can be gotten on ps3.
[3:41:51] <%SoFarFetched> I mean it is vague
[3:41:51] <usurper_sos> Yes
[3:41:51] <%Dementedpenguin> God, I remember back when someone tried to stream Persona 3 PSP back when it came out
[3:41:54] <%person181> sdk psihr
[3:41:58] <%Dragon_Batman> Pcsx2 was how I was able to play P4
[3:41:59] <%Hellarussian> so Pats Persona would be the toilet goblin yeah?
[3:42:02] <%Keyd00d> Lilim is later
[3:42:04] <Manmadeawesome> you can play 1-4 on vita
[3:42:09] <+NitronStreams> Succ acquired
[3:42:09] <heartlesshealer> lilim has different hair
[3:42:10] <+Brickston> @Hellarussian baby mara
[3:42:11] <%ConLin_Arts_> Succ a Buss
[3:42:11] <smilemychild> i have P3FES and P4 on the PS2 but I havent beaten either of em
[3:42:12] <%spiritofmojave> or Mada
[3:42:15] <timetraveller2000> So out of P3, P4 and P5, which is the best? I’m inclined to say 3 myself
[3:42:15] <clintonificent> you are toilet
[3:42:15] <%Keyd00d> and he wears heels
[3:42:15] <%BoomerUnchained> Big simp energy
[3:42:15] <%spiritofmojave> *Mara
[3:42:15] <filialpails> lilim has the devil tail
[3:42:16] <%DesuDesuDokiDoki> LUL
[3:42:16] <SnakeVash> 13 SENTINELS
[3:42:20] <+pectusumbra> lilim has the white hot pants and half-gloves. *That* outfit is HOT
[3:42:22] <Huntercd> lilim and lilith
[3:42:22] <smilemychild> Paige would totally be Nekomata
[3:42:23] <%KaiserMario> Is Paige's persona Mara?
[3:42:23] <Charronia> More waifu personas rooHappy
[3:42:25] <%Dragon_Batman> It really would be
[3:42:26] <GarbageQueenEllie> Alice is cool. She make the people die
[3:42:28] <Valentinius_Anodyne> Pat's Persona would be Diogenes B)
[3:42:30] <Sol_Install> Lives on a cube toilet
[3:42:32] <%ShichiNoBushi> Your Persona is Belphagore's toilet.
[3:42:33] <Ks201> There is a p3 emulator
[3:42:34] <zeif00> Shadow Pat tho
[3:42:36] <heartlesshealer> Yeah, Lilim has different hair and wears white
[3:42:36] <TioXyco> Rare arcanas to this point
[3:42:38] <LeaIsChill> Pat D:
[3:42:38] <ScreamLord> Justice Bondage
[3:42:41] <%Puhff> German Spy streamed P3 recently
[3:42:43] <%Ultimatefool> Don't think you need a Moon persona for the S Link in this one
[3:42:45] <UnderpaidBob> I love Messiah in P3 b/c it's just so on the nose
[3:42:45] <%Dragon_Batman> NAh PAige is Hell Rider, it literally is just kool Papyrus
[3:42:50] <+SlumberMan> Why not Abadon, the Persona that appears when you fuck up manifesting a Persona?
[3:42:58] <clintonificent> but p3 is near-evangelion levels of just hopeless fuck the world, especially in the November-December region
[3:43:00] <tmix1600> P5 is P3 +P4 but worst in all their strongest points
[3:43:00] <rcand9> arrest this man for stream crimes
[3:43:01] <Ubu2933> blue is gloomy, yellow silly/happy, red is angry, so for p6 green, purple or orange what will the prevailing emotion of the game be?
[3:43:06] <shevan123> god this theme is good
[3:43:13] <%FacetiousAF> what
[3:43:14] <nolzee> what
[3:43:15] <%GabeSweetMan> CHEEVO
[3:43:15] <%Typhaeon> Damn son

[3:43:19] <usurper_sos> CHEEVOS
[3:43:20] <%FacetiousAF> what the fuck is that what the fuck explosion??
[3:43:21] <%King_Wolf_Rigger> That was some damage
[3:43:21] <%Maids4lyfe> destroyed
[3:43:21] <+Jp3g95> rooDuck
[3:43:23] <TioXyco> ... what was that? that was COOL
[3:43:23] <+NitronStreams> explosion
[3:43:23] <timetraveller2000> @ubu2933 watch P6’s colour be Velvet PogChamp PogChamp
[3:43:25] <Meekest> New mechanic
[3:43:25] <SnakeVash> THE NAME OF THE EVA-NIER MECHA GAME IS 13 SENTINELS
[3:43:26] <ScreamLord> Slooty
[3:43:28] <%GabeSweetMan> Dangerously cheevy
[3:43:28] <%Dragon_Batman> For those that missed it those doods are new
[3:43:29] <quietshun> that was a disaster shadow
[3:43:29] <heartlesshealer> But Paige is also stylin', so gotta be Matador for fabulous skull man who is big and strong
[3:43:29] <spinbel> What the fuck was that
[3:43:33] <smilemychild> P5 lies right in between P4 and 3 in terms of story vs gameplay
[3:43:35] <%ShichiNoBushi> New mechanic.
[3:43:36] <zenith0111> Idk how I feel about those explody enemies
[3:43:36] <spinbel> Royal's crazy
[3:43:38] <%genowyn> Why does pat not know how to pronounce soot
[3:43:39] <%Nobrev> @timetraveller2000 I'm gonna say 5 because vanilla 3 had too many QoL issues and p3p fixed some of them but also turned into a point and click game
[3:43:39] <+evbites> rad
[3:43:40] <%Keyd00d> New Royal mechanic
[3:43:41] <%FacetiousAF> 16 :/
[3:43:42] <LeaIsChill> BlessRNG
[3:43:42] <+SlumberMan> @Ubu2933 Green's associated with spring and plants, so maybe something to do with rebirth or redemption?
[3:43:42] <clintonificent> yeyeyeyeye
[3:43:45] <%WhereIsWill> yeyeye
[3:43:45] <%DesuDesuDokiDoki> ya boi
[3:43:45] <+knowyourenemy_97> What was that? That was a big explosion
[3:43:50] <%indig0bird> lvl 16 T.T
[3:43:53] <zeif00> Paige who is your favorite P4 character?
[3:43:57] <+SlumberMan> New beginnings and all that.
[3:44:03] <TioXyco> ANGLE
[3:44:08] <%Dragon_Batman> You attack them first and they can explode depending on how much damage they took, tho they always counter never attack
[3:44:30] <timetraveller2000> @nobrev in terms of gameplay 5 is the best, easily but story wise I think 3 is best, just the way everything comes together is so good in that game
[3:44:31] <+SlumberMan> Though given the series's history with "redemption", maybe not.
[3:44:31] <+Daniel_Is_I> Randyyyy
[3:44:31] <DarknessD42> Randy no
[3:44:33] <%luckysteak> Captain Kidd is so much cooler than Sun Wukong. It is not even a competition
[3:44:34] <devil_may_cum_> Favorite song in the ost
[3:44:38] <+Brickston> So what's this SP regen accessory, did he skin the fox from P4? It's nuts.
[3:44:42] <%hmgirlpopuri> Is that a right eye that doesn't pay the bonuses it promised?
[3:44:48] <%Manjove> FRREAL
[3:44:50] <%KaiserMario> Is Jesus a Persona in any of the games?
[3:44:50] <%hawk_rush> FOR REAL
[3:44:51] <%spiritofmojave> 4real
[3:44:51] <%FacetiousAF> GRIND
[3:44:54] <ScreamLord> Randy's Right Eye Ring
[3:44:56] <Aydarkzero> swole enemies monkaS
[3:44:57] <%FacetiousAF> kill them all peter
[3:44:59] <tmix1600> How long until this game drops to 40 bucks?
[3:45:00] <+Jp3g95> @luckysteak new content ;)
[3:45:01] <%Jickiechan> Which is better Persona 3 FES or Portable
[3:45:02] <Dr_Mooose> LUL
[3:45:04] <%luckysteak> @KaiserMario there is a Messiah persona
[3:45:06] <Berendenn> Theres Messiah
[3:45:06] <rcand9> what qol stuff is in this game
[3:45:12] <Cybersoul666> @kaisermario in p3 there is Messiah
[3:45:16] <%dukenux> Thats they eye he used to looking away from employee complaints
[3:45:16] <timetraveller2000> @luckysteak have you seen Ryuji’s third awakening Persona? That’s dope
[3:45:18] <DRAGKUDO> @kaisermario Messiah in P3
[3:45:18] <+pectusumbra> I just like the Persona 5 persona designs better
[3:45:19] <+dheng1> Drinking game for everytime ryuji says for real
[3:45:20] <%KaiserMario> Ah sure
[3:45:22] <%GabeSweetMan> Murder is the only option
[3:45:22] <%Dragon_Batman> I think Portable personally
[3:45:23] <%dukenux> *for
[3:45:24] <%spiritofmojave> @jickiechan FES for having models, P3P for actual gameplay control
[3:45:26] <+yunngin> jeez youve been in this dungeon for a long time and barely lose any sp
[3:45:26] <Ubu2933> That would be fun, shame they already used the royal as a subtitle before they got to purple, still can't beleive they didn't use rebellion or rogue
[3:45:27] <%DesuDesuDokiDoki> murderer
[3:45:31] <heartlesshealer> Messiah is just an Orpheus skin
[3:45:32] <%luckysteak> @timetraveller2000 No, I haven't! thank you for giving me hope!
[3:45:40] <+SlumberMan> @Jickiechan P3P has way better gameplay and all the content of FES+more, but it's a huge presentation downgrade.
[3:45:45] <+neonNeptunian> that weren't just insta-kills
[3:45:48] <+dudeenoch> insstas?
[3:45:48] <%Dragon_Batman> Instead of just kill
[3:45:51] <%MaddyCaddy> Oooooo Hamaon
[3:45:51] <+pectusumbra> P4 ones are a bit avant-garde. Though P4 has better boss designs I think
[3:45:51] <%dukenux> Man... Randy could totally be a Persona villain
[3:45:54] <UnderpaidBob> never understood that
[3:45:57] <+mashinchaserr> curse and bless are great
[3:46:01] <%bevyrage> yeah the insta-kills with single digit proc rates in P4 sucked shit
[3:46:01] <KaslinMagite> You are so right
[3:46:04] <%LaughingCatt> begone horribly inaccurate instant-kill bullshit spells
[3:46:06] <heartlesshealer> yeah, getting Eiha instead of the instant kill dark skill is great
[3:46:06] <KaslinMagite> GREED
[3:46:08] <%Keyd00d> Allegedly
[3:46:08] <%indig0bird> Randy Greed Arcana
[3:46:09] <usurper_sos> He would be Greed
[3:46:10] <%optimasmaximas> omg he could LUL
[3:46:11] <%kyh9> His sin is USB filled with kiddie porn
[3:46:12] <nolzee> the new sin of lies
[3:46:13] <heartlesshealer> and they brought back the nuclear spells
[3:46:14] <%GabeSweetMan> Yeah I hated insta-kill stuff. It's just not even fun to use cuz there's little in the way of strategy.
[3:46:14] <UnderpaidBob> lol his palace would be sick
[3:46:15] <%biomegabear> RANDY PITCHFORD 1000%
[3:46:15] <%Dragon_Batman> I could see him be Makotos dungeon
[3:46:16] <Blank9> smt4 apocalypse does it really well, they made light/dark damage spells that have a high chance of instakill if you smirk
[3:46:17] <+pectusumbra> You mean Okumura?
[3:46:17] <Meekest> He'd dress up as a magician
[3:46:21] <YakumoYomi> It's nice to have stuff other than Hama and Mudo for Expel and Death
[3:46:22] <+Brickston> @bevyrage they weren't bad chances on certain enemies, and those enemies were usually tanks otherwise
[3:46:22] <%Dragon_Batman> The bug dood
[3:46:22] <%spiritofmojave> Randy basically is Kamoshida and the third palace ruler
[3:46:23] <%Hellarussian> saved
[3:46:24] <+TheBigO75> Lets just skip trying to change his heart
[3:46:25] <%DesuDesuDokiDoki> YEAH

[3:46:26] <%Aleate> ruuS
[3:46:26] <%majindusto> You mean He Isn't?
[3:46:27] <%Valdorick> Randy's Persona would just be Handsome Jack, but with no charisma.
[3:46:29] <%zamzoph> TRUE
[3:46:29] <%kyh9> Paige, ATTACK
[3:46:29] <+tigerfang86> NICE SAVE

[3:46:33] <JoshTheFace> LUL
[3:46:34] <+HeathCottengim> wtf
[3:46:34] <smilemychild> lol, persona but for game devs! Randy would be Greed, Todd would be Pride
[3:46:35] <theredhairedtrainer> LUL
[3:46:36] <+tigerfang86> REAL GOOD SAVE, FOR SURE
[3:46:36] <%Nobrev> I like that royal gives us baton pass right off the bat instead of making us unlock it on every party member individually
[3:46:36] <KilljoyHexx> S A V E D
[3:46:37] <%optimasmaximas> LUL
[3:46:37] <JonWhoLovesFlatWomen> monkaS

[3:46:38] <usurper_sos> hmmm
[3:46:39] <%superc37> nice save
[3:46:40] <+egalitarian696969> Joe Exotic's palace is literally just his zoo
[3:46:40] <%ShichiNoBushi> All the Digimon are crying now.
[3:46:40] <%Jickiechan> hmmm i might emulate FES, ill see how the gameplay is since i heard you can't control the whole party
[3:46:43] <+Jp3g95> @Aleate ruuHug
[3:46:44] <Sol_Install> That was SUPER CLOSE to being VERY BAD
[3:46:45] <%Binary_Fireball> Would pat be mean to an android???
[3:46:45] <$lotharrio> Based Pat.
[3:46:46] <%hmgirlpopuri> Man Randy's press conference confessing his sins would be wild
[3:46:51] <%Aleate> @Jp3g95 ruuLove
[3:46:52] <%dukenux> respect digiwomon
[3:46:58] <UnderpaidBob> It's hard to go back to FES after 4 and 5 tbh
[3:46:58] <nolzee> His treasure would be the USB stick filled with porn
[3:46:59] <%BonewheelVanguard> clip that for the robot uprising

[3:47:26] <%spiritofmojave> ....no
[3:47:26] <%Dragon_Batman> LUL I missed that
[3:47:29] <%cvp5127> that was kevin
[3:47:30] <Kuj999> Ben 10
[3:47:31] <%Manjove> nailed it
[3:47:32] <+TheBigO75> I love that line
[3:47:33] <%CappuccinoGuil> "No.... I feel like I've made a mistake"
[3:47:33] <+NitronStreams> "No. I sense ive made some mistake"
[3:47:35] <$Trenr> No, I sense I've made a mistake
[3:47:36] <+TheBigO75> Fucking Kevin
[3:47:36] <oniwahoo> Yeah, that absolutely sounds like something Kevin would say
[3:47:36] <%dukenux> i need to look up this
[3:47:37] <%dekkitout> Kevin 'The Man' Levin
[3:47:37] <+JonThePrettyOKGuy> Did I miss a Ben 10 reference?
[3:47:38] <TDAWS_MP132> "I sense I have made a mistake"
[3:47:40] <%weissguard> Ben 10 Alien Force, IIRC
[3:47:40] <%superc37> Tbf Kevin treats his car VERY well
[3:47:41] <+justianxix> Oh I remember that LUL
[3:47:42] <$lotharrio> That sounds like a Kevin and Gwen line
[3:47:44] <%King_Wolf_Rigger> He falls apart lol.
[3:47:44] <ovan20> so he have sex with his car? Kappa
[3:47:45] <%cherrycottontail> Ben 10 is underrated
[3:47:45] <ScreamLord> "I sense I've made a mistake of some kind."
[3:47:47] <%goose_attack_almanac> Kevin Levin backin that one up
[3:47:47] <%Dragon_Batman> Was that Kevin 11? that makes sense
[3:47:49] <+HauteTactique> @JonThePrettyOKGuy the treat a woman like a car bit
[3:47:50] <GarbageQueenEllie> But I wanted to hear the end of that analogy!

[3:47:59] <wendigo172> Kevin is the best
[3:47:59] <%spiritofmojave> BACKDOWN
[3:48:04] <+Jimboq> the pat strategy
[3:48:04] <%CappuccinoGuil> It's called "Backing Down" something Pat is very familiar with
[3:48:05] <%weissguard> Ironic, given that Kevin 11 adores his car and respects it. LUL
[3:48:06] <+pectusumbra> Kevin "I'm in danger!" Levin
[3:48:07] <heartlesshealer> Kevin's great
[3:48:07] <%Mr_Strut> Pat loves cowardice
[3:48:16] <+JonThePrettyOKGuy> I feel like I made a mistake. Hehe
[3:48:17] <BlackOrchidKI> Get the toe crack in there

[3:51:24] <zenith0111> Did you guys hear about how ST:Picard's writer admits to trying to make people angry at he show?
[3:51:24] <%hawk_rush> or shorter
[3:51:27] <%jackythefrost> Futaba's palace is like 3 times as long as this
[3:51:29] <%luckysteak> Thanks for the answers

[3:53:41] <+bluedude153> Do they at least let you use your starter persona for longer this time around
[3:53:41] <%reonome> you can do it with dlc personas
[3:53:42] <%Dragon_Batman> I mean, did he use the big personers?
[3:53:43] <timetraveller2000> What a hero PogChamp
[3:53:44] <%hmgirlpopuri> I mean if you fastforward all of the dialogue I could see that
[3:53:46] <%miguelrod777> also why
[3:53:46] <tacoisgoods> Why tho
[3:53:47] <+linSP> how many recorded live speedruns of this game are there
[3:53:48] <%Calek> world record of the original is 16 hours
[3:53:48] <+justianxix> did he skip all the cutscenes?
[3:53:48] <+Jimboq> more like an endurance run
[3:53:49] <%King_Wolf_Rigger> Who ever made that bet lost so fuckin hard lol
[3:53:49] <%Hellarussian> dangit bobby
[3:53:50] <%Nobrev> strident is a fucking demon
[3:53:52] <%ssjklyco> that's a lot of content to skip
[3:53:52] <%shaidot> did he cheat tho?
[3:53:52] <%optimasmaximas> @GabeSweetMan jesus
[3:53:53] <+JonThePrettyOKGuy> Bruh, now you can do every dungeon 1st day with that. Busted af
[3:53:54] <%GabeSweetMan> BECAUSE chat, BECAUSE
[3:53:55] <rcand9> 30 on a speedrun
[3:53:56] <%dukenux> BUT DAYD
[3:53:59] <wrightlight94> lteddyGLASSES
[3:53:59] <%rdark_ksu> that boah aint right
[3:54:05] <zenith0111> So that means all he did was skip the cutscenes? @patstaresat
[3:54:06] <Darakoi> did he use dlc personas to kill enemies quickly in early game?
[3:54:06] <%FacetiousAF> he did it for the reward of malic acid
[3:54:11] <%ssjklyco> I'm at the second dungeon right now and with the changes, it's easier to grind with just the base changes.
[3:54:18] <tacoisgoods> Why did he roleplay a loser with no friends
[3:54:21] <%Keyd00d> when you got big dlccheat
[3:54:23] <+Venaire> I regret downloading the free DLC so much, giving me the ability to use a 90+ Persona at Kamoshida is dumb
[3:54:27] <timetraveller2000> If Morgana is the highest level character in your party, something’s gone horribly wrong LUL
[3:54:32] <+Daniel_Is_I> Like 80% of the game is dialogue and socializing
[3:54:34] <%Jickiechan> yh like MGS4 with skipping cutscenes
[3:54:34] <%Dragon_Batman> I imagine he may only have stopped for a bit for new stuff but who knows
[3:54:38] <+Venaire> The fact its there just kinda is like poison to me
[3:54:43] <%cylish> Wait had a thought, is this game saying that the town in P4 and the school in P3 were just massive palaces?
[3:54:43] <tmix1600> P4 you can speed run HARD
[3:54:44] <%hmgirlpopuri> Are the camera straps from one of the DLC packs?
[3:54:44] <+bluedude153> I used izanagi for all of p5
[3:54:54] <+bluedude153> kept buffing it in weird ways
[3:54:55] <%Dragon_Batman> Yea @hmgirlpopuri
[3:54:56] <$lotharrio> Wait so that means the cafe owner is Hank's older brother, Junichiro? He got out of the robot game?
[3:55:03] <fragdar> what the glasses do?
[3:55:05] <+TrevSmith222> I hear they killed the flu trick with Death.

[3:55:10] <DRAGKUDO> @cylish no
[3:55:11] <+daddychokemeharder> Also how does the new female character work? is she just a female joker or a brand new character entirley?
[3:55:13] <%hmgirlpopuri> @Dragon_Batman Do you know which one? Pondering picking this up still and that'd make it a lot less stressful
[3:55:20] <zenith0111> @venaire I know what you mean. Moments like are like "Okay devs do you want me to break the game?"

[3:58:20] <fakkuza> ah shoot when did he start?!??!
[3:58:20] <fragdar> just a shame that it takes soo long to get the whole gang
[3:58:23] <%moogleboy1984> Imagine if Atlus wasn't such shitheads and made a Steam release of Nocturne and DDS with the updated models from P5
[3:58:25] <%KaiserMario> I'm kinda sad Pat never finished FFXII, that was going well
[3:58:26] <+pectusumbra> check back there, there was a grapple point wasn't there?

[3:58:29] <%mak0t0yukii> fuck
[3:58:30] <+Daniel_Is_I> But won't they become unbalanced once you get Yusuke?

[3:58:37] <%Dragon_Batman> they*
[3:58:40] <@commanderclaw> Why don't games just put party members at the same level as the protag?
[3:58:40] <sad_toast_> because fuck
[3:58:41] <neVan0> cuz FUCK
[3:58:43] <%Razputin217> psaGoblin psaGoblin psaGoblin
[3:58:44] <GarbageQueenEllie> Oh, Yusukeeee
[3:58:52] <%Keyd00d> best boy
[3:59:00] <heartlesshealer> They will because Yusuke has Ice attacks and speed buffs
[3:59:01] <megaman_sentinel> don't let them win Pat
[3:59:01] <%Diana869> i never had issue with keeping them balanced is that common?
[3:59:04] <%nilla_24> go back to that wall, there's a chest
[3:59:08] <shiny_prinny> yeah new party members are usually different levels
[3:59:08] <%Keyd00d> D:
[3:59:10] <+PleasantLee> where do teenagers get firearms in japan? asking for a friend
[3:59:10] <+UltraViolet371> @commanderclaw I think the latest Pokemon did something like that, and people hate it
[3:59:11] <%hawk_rush> D:
[3:59:12] <KaslinMagite> @SweetCheeksPlays Holy crap, I just peeked over at your VOD. That's some big femboi energy!
[3:59:14] <%MaddyCaddy> But he's cool
[3:59:16] <%Valdorick> BLASPHEMER
[3:59:17] <timetraveller2000> @daniel_is_i if I remember right, Yusuke will be level 15 when we get him
[3:59:18] <+Daniel_Is_I> I gotta keep my entire party at the same level even if I don't use them
[3:59:18] <%Diana869> D:
[3:59:19] <%ape_hawk> yusukes good
[3:59:19] <%MaddyCaddy> You can hang with the boyz
[3:59:21] <fragdar> yusuke does so much fucking damage
[3:59:21] <%cherrycottontail> yusuke is just a better ryuji
[3:59:22] <heartlesshealer> Sukukaja tho
[3:59:25] <BallHaul> One day Pat will beat the mind goblins.
[3:59:25] <+Venaire> Yusuke is garbo compared to Ryugi
[3:59:26] <+jjjdanny> anti yusuke crimes
[3:59:27] <Crimpson> I used them all because all of them are good
[3:59:28] <%Dragon_Batman> I used him a bunch too
[3:59:29] <%GabeSweetMan> Everyone is useful.
[3:59:31] <%Dr00_PhD> He becomes a god of destruction
[3:59:33] <%Agami23> i suggest a team of new girl, haru, and ann
[3:59:36] <timetraveller2000> Not using Yusuke DansGame
[3:59:37] <GarbageQueenEllie> Yusuke's persona is the craziest shit I ever seen, love that kabuki shit
[3:59:38] <%valriot> Yusuke is so good with the Baton buffs though
[3:59:39] <%KaiserMario> That's fair, if he used him last time, might as well change
[3:59:39] <%person181> just finished the second boss and it's SO MUCH better then in normal P5
[3:59:41] <%Rumbutt> Haru for the win, just OSK everything with psaBig GUN
[3:59:41] <+dudeenoch> i think when you're able to swap party members on the fly, you possibly could be using everyone
[3:59:43] <+Daniel_Is_I> Haru is AMAZING.
[3:59:45] <Huntercd> Haru
[3:59:46] <%GabeSweetMan> It's the most balanced party in any RPG ever.
[3:59:46] <%plus_on_black> I have no idea what ya'll speaking of but I respect it.
[3:59:47] <$spardanwarrior> What was your team back in Vanilla P5?
[3:59:47] <%Klefth> The original game kinda screws up by making the initial party the overall best choice in terms of utility and damage. Hope they changed that
[3:59:47] <psychotripstreams> @kaslinmagite Lol he IS a femboi after all
[3:59:48] <%Keyd00d> Haru is great
[3:59:49] <%Dragon_Batman> Yea no one was benched
[3:59:51] <+Goliz> Alright
[3:59:53] <fragdar> never got a decent build for haru
[3:59:54] <+Venaire> Haru might be super good with the ammo changes
[3:59:55] <%nilla_24> @PatStaresAt there's a hiden chest behind the walls in the other room
[3:59:57] <+Goliz> I'm buying this ultimate version
[3:59:57] <%ssjklyco> I hope they fix the instant kill Ryuji has later
[3:59:59] <heartlesshealer> yeah, everyone feels viable, unlike in P3 and P4
[3:59:59] <KaslinMagite> It's great.
[4:00:00] <%kyh9> Makoto, Futaba and Haru are pretty boring, as is the Get Smoked kid and Mishima
[4:00:01] <+daddychokemeharder> i always have to have makoto on my team
[4:00:02] <+Goliz> Fuck it
[4:00:05] <+Daniel_Is_I> Haru is gun gun gun
[4:00:10] <%baronblank> I'm planning on rocking a Yusuke, Morgana, Haru team til I get the new girl and see what she can do
[4:00:13] <%GabeSweetMan> So often rpgs with extended party members results in your rolling with just The Crew, and everybody else gets benched.
[4:00:18] <+JonThePrettyOKGuy> I swap my party comp so much. shit never mattered to me. Except for Haru. She wasn't that good
[4:00:18] <%kyh9> Makoto literally just forces herself into the plot with no rhyme or reason
[4:00:19] <%baronblank> though I guess Haru's only gonna be there a little
[4:00:23] <+Dorf1> i never got much use out of ann or morgana in my vanilla hard playthrough
[4:00:24] <grimshuck> i wonder what element kasumi will have?
[4:00:34] <+NitronStreams> yoosookay
[4:00:39] <neVan0> yusakay
[4:00:39] <+FortNothing> Go full Haru
[4:00:41] <bendatron> Haru had heat riser making her super important
[4:00:46] <%Dragon_Batman> Honestly thinkin about it I had the same thing, if not Yusuke than Morgana
[4:00:47] <%KaiserMario> Makoto is pretty cool tho, shame her sister is much better
[4:00:47] <timetraveller2000> My party tends to be Ryuji, Yusuke and Morgana whenever I can, #Boysquad
[4:00:48] <+pectusumbra> kasumi has light
[4:00:48] <powerprotoman> yeah now youll run ryuji yusuke and morgana
[4:00:50] <heartlesshealer> Kasumi might be gun/pierce
[4:00:51] <%hmgirlpopuri> @PatStaresAt Are you gonna go for Sojiro's chocolate?
[4:00:52] <%kyh9> Who's Haru?
[4:00:52] <%starkandstag> Ryuji/Makoto/Haru gang
[4:00:52] <%LaughingCatt> Ann, Haru, new girl?
[4:00:54] <Crimpson> I abused those when fighting the one of the final bosses
[4:00:54] <%MaddyCaddy> Forehead
[4:00:55] <+Daniel_Is_I> Ann, Haru, and Kasumi?
[4:00:57] <Blank9> def use haru and kasumi
[4:00:57] <%FacetiousAF> people really like using haru
[4:00:58] <%moogleboy1984> Haru...spex?
[4:00:59] <chocolate_matter> Embrace the floof.
[4:00:59] <%FacetiousAF> for battle
[4:01:01] <quietshun> Haru is sick
[4:01:01] <%ssjklyco> She was no Haru-ble
[4:01:02] <%GabeSweetMan> Haru's prurdy good tho
[4:01:02] <%Rumbutt> Haru is so good if you get all her gun skills
[4:01:02] <GarbageQueenEllie> Haru looks like the Humansona of Lady from Lady and the Tramp, and that just weirds me out
[4:01:03] <%ConLin_Arts_> Haru was too lategame for me
[4:01:05] <%FacetiousAF> haru has the floof hair
[4:01:05] <megaman_sentinel> just look at map
[4:01:05] <+Jp3g95> Atlus LET US HUG SHIHO you cowards rooGun
[4:01:06] <MSN04_Sazabi> The game barely used Haru
[4:01:06] <%foreverN2dust> har-who?
[4:01:07] <%Diana869> a lot of people barely used Haru
[4:01:07] <%spiritofmojave> which is a shame cause Haru, Makoto, and Tusuke are some good shit
[4:01:09] <%cherrycottontail> to be fair, haru exists for 2 dungeons
[4:01:11] <tacoisgoods> why did you take away Haru's screentime
[4:01:11] <+Mitchellsocks> I barely used Haru because I couldn't unlock her Baton Pass
[4:01:11] <%HRDSalami654> Ask Clemps.
[4:01:12] <+Goliz> @PatStaresAt Would you say the graphical upgrades are significant?
[4:01:12] <+JonThePrettyOKGuy> I think she'll be useful for the new semester?
[4:01:16] <%Shady_Squid> DO NOT BE MEAN TO HARU
[4:01:16] <%KaiserMario> There new chick to consider on this one
[4:01:16] <%Katashi25> Corgo100 Corgo100 Corgo100 Corgo100 Corgo100 Hey Pat, what are your thoughts on Grandia? it was one of my first games on the playstation that I rented at my local video rental store. also would you ever stream it?
[4:01:16] <%spiritofmojave> *Yusuke, even
[4:01:16] <%baronblank> haru's actually a good party member, she's just weird mechanically and comes in so late
[4:01:17] <+daddychokemeharder> never been a fan of haru, ann just seems better to me
[4:01:18] <powerprotoman> my team was ann makoto and haru
[4:01:18] <+pectusumbra> Let's be real, Milady is the coolest fucking persona
[4:01:19] <+dudeenoch> but forehead
[4:01:20] <heartlesshealer> Haru was alright in my run
[4:01:25] <quietshun> big gun damage
[4:01:26] <%jackythefrost> The main issue with Haru was fixed in this version of the game
[4:01:28] <+Jp3g95> Haru = 4Head
[4:01:28] <%Ascethetic> Haru was in my main party in P5
[4:01:30] <+Dorf1> i used haru for mobs and switched her out with ryuji for bosses
[4:01:30] <%Diana869> not that much
[4:01:31] <$TheWizardGwonam> I change my team frequently in this game
[4:01:37] <%FacetiousAF> haru was the one with the little hat
[4:01:37] <%Keyd00d> Looks about the same to me
[4:01:38] <striberx> @Jp3g95 Just Shiho? I wana hug all of the confidants. So many need a hug.
[4:01:40] <%GabeSweetMan> Do they introduce Haru sooner in Royal? She SERIOUSLY needs the earlier exposure.
[4:01:43] <%kyh9> Every party member is good mechanically, it's just a shame not enough of the arcs they're introduced in are written as well as Kamoshida's or Madarame's
[4:01:46] <%arancet> graphic updates arent super noticable, but the load times are WAY better
[4:01:49] <+Goliz> I opened up the old version and it did look kinda rough
[4:01:50] <%shaidot> it just loads faster
[4:01:51] <%jackythefrost> Haru actually has screen time in P5R
[4:01:52] <MoonlightP> haru is great. she gets fucked over in her dungeon is the problem. her arc gets intruded on by that dumb morgana vs ryuji schism
[4:01:54] <%biomegabear> Persona 5: seprete ways
[4:01:55] <timetraveller2000> Graphics look pretty similar to P5 to me
[4:01:58] <%foreverN2dust> BlessRNG
[4:01:59] <+Venaire> Ann makes a godtier nuker with Concentrate/Boost/Amp combo
[4:02:01] <shiny_prinny> just get them all to 99 then they'll all be even leveled
[4:02:02] <+Jp3g95> @striberx can I get a hug? rooHug
[4:02:02] <MoonlightP> but she has one of the best party member slinks
[4:02:03] <YakumoYomi> Haru has an unfortunate hairstyle. Her portrait often makes it look like she's balding
[4:02:03] <+Mitchellsocks> I basically used everyone, because of Mishima's confidant
[4:02:04] <+temporal_zenith> Pat: *Grapple away*
[4:02:07] <%ConLin_Arts_> Haru gets her Screen Time by Jamezietocool is really good
[4:02:08] <zenith0111> The changes in Graphics are pretty minor. Like a little more animation flair or a new ui element but nothing huge
[4:02:09] <usurper_sos> fuckin . . .
[4:02:09] <%Jickiechan> I wish P3 and 4 got HD Remakes
[4:02:10] <+pectusumbra> yay
[4:02:15] <%biomegabear> Joke is Ada
[4:02:15] <MoonlightP> and she's a strong gameplay-wise
[4:02:16] <striberx> @Jp3g95 Of course!!! *Hugz!!* ^w^
[4:02:20] <timetraveller2000> @moonlightp honestly Haru deserved better
[4:02:20] <MoonlightP> character
[4:02:20] <%PunishedMercer_> did somebody say !grapple?
[4:02:24] <%PunishedMercer_> psaRaffle
[4:02:25] <MoonlightP> she 100% did
[4:02:26] <+Jp3g95> rooAww
[4:02:27] <%Calek> they'll all be balanced at 99
[4:02:27] <%Dr00_PhD> and then you can swap them on the fly with Hifumi
[4:02:34] <%joylent_blue> psaRaffle
[4:02:34] <%DesuDesuDokiDoki> G U N
[4:02:34] <striberx> @Jp3g95 :D
[4:02:40] <%hmgirlpopuri> What's the gun change?
[4:02:41] <$TheWizardGwonam> yep, Mishima is pretty important for that
[4:02:41] <+love_otter> Can anyone explain to me how anyone likes Yusuke? His treatment of Ann when you first meet him unforgivable.
[4:02:43] <WillofGame> It's so fucking good.
[4:02:43] <%WhereIsWill> what happens if that alert gauge gets to 100?
[4:02:43] <%foreverN2dust> what changed with the gun? ammo?
[4:02:44] <$WackyXmand> Persona 5 vanilla was just a up scaled PS3 game anyway
[4:02:44] <+Daniel_Is_I> Get ryuji maxed and just grind to 99 BloodTrail
[4:02:45] <+JonThePrettyOKGuy> Being able to use gun. By god...
[4:02:47] <%GeneralSCPatton> Seems like a great RPG, but Atlus' bullshit soured me on it, and the calendar would give me mind goblins.
[4:02:49] <%foreverN2dust> Pog
[4:02:50] <+daddychokemeharder> Ryuuji is just such a powerhouse
[4:02:50] <%hmgirlpopuri> ...that's amazing
[4:02:52] <%KaiserMario> You can go for Morgana, Haru and New Chick... there might someone else later tho...
[4:02:53] <%cylish> All your bullets
[4:02:54] <COMB711> WOW
[4:02:56] <thatWaulfyguy> YOOOOOOO
[4:02:57] <%Calek> you don't regenerate a small amount, it's all of them
[4:02:58] <+chaumiester> Isn't a full Regen?
[4:02:58] <%Dr00_PhD> You get a full clip every fight
[4:02:58] <nitsujikun> all bullets, not a small amount
[4:03:00] <heartlesshealer> Guns have no hard limit on a dungeon exploration
[4:03:03] <%Klefth> So you can actually use guns? Nice
[4:03:05] <+egalitarian696969> man I'll have to play this on extreme then
[4:03:07] <%ssjklyco> it's all bullets
[4:03:07] <%GabeSweetMan> Now the new strategy is GUN GUN GUN GUN GUN
[4:03:08] <%DesuDesuDokiDoki> complete regeneration of bullets
[4:03:09] <WillofGame> I dropped my jaw when I was told that.
[4:03:09] <+SpicyCheeseNips> all bullets pat not some
[4:03:10] <thatWaulfyguy> that's rad
[4:03:12] <zenith0111> I forgot guns were limited in p5...
[4:03:13] <%MaddyCaddy> Why does it matter so much?
[4:03:14] <GarbageQueenEllie> @love_otter He just wanted a nude model... and asked an underage girl to do it... yikes
[4:03:16] <aeonicvector> 1 clip a fight instead of 32 ammo for a WHOLE dungeon
[4:03:16] <heartlesshealer> Guns reload between battles
[4:03:17] <%Keyd00d> get on the butt
[4:03:19] <+Jp3g95> rcomIsa
[4:03:25] <+enigmaticgear> grappling
[4:03:25] <+pectusumbra> Did I miss the third will seed? This is close to the end right?
[4:03:26] <%person181> touch the butt
[4:03:28] <%hmgirlpopuri> I would pick this up if FF7R wasn't so close, I think
[4:03:31] <%DesuDesuDokiDoki> climb butt
[4:03:34] <%Manjove> big butt
[4:03:34] <usurper_sos> Climb the butt
[4:03:37] <zenith0111> @maddycaddy Could only reload once you leave the dungeon in OG
[4:03:38] <+Goliz> Butt climbing
[4:03:39] <+JonThePrettyOKGuy> Climb a booty
[4:03:40] <+kuervojones> Is this coming out for the Switch?
[4:03:41] <timetraveller2000> @love_otter I imagine it’s because his social link is one of the best in the game, also he’s so stupid in the rest of the game that it’s easy to laugh at him. I do agree he starts as a dick tho
[4:03:44] <heartlesshealer> a butt was turned
[4:03:45] <+SpicyCheeseNips> but a butt
[4:03:49] <KaslinMagite> BOOTY BOOTY BOOTY
[4:03:50] <+FakeWaifu> Man I kind of am interested in rebuying and replaying becuase of GUN changes.
[4:03:50] <%cvp5127> mount booty
[4:03:51] <+love_otter> @GarbageQueenEllie An underaged girl who was a victim of sexual abuse as well
[4:03:51] <%DesuDesuDokiDoki> yes good
[4:03:53] <YakumoYomi> Mount booty
[4:03:54] <%bread_assassin> Climb dat booty.
[4:04:00] <%spiritofmojave> Mount ze butt
[4:04:04] <WillofGame> Climb da booty
[4:04:08] <%KaiserMario> Is that how you and Paige do eet?
[4:04:11] <+enigmaticgear> missed treasure
[4:04:15] <zenith0111> Guns were already super strong in p5 so it's a little overkill now
[4:04:24] <%NovaKnightmare> dont call it that
[4:04:26] <%King_Wolf_Rigger> Climb the butt to look at package
[4:04:28] <NiN10doh_ULTRA_64> cirNom
[4:04:29] <Wan6Saber> lel
[4:04:29] <zenith0111> Guns are really easy to grind for crits
[4:04:30] <GarbageQueenEllie> @love_otter I'm not sure he knew that. But still, I'm only just now thinking it over as yikes
[4:04:35] <%rdark_ksu> steal everything
[4:04:35] <+Jp3g95> rooNom
[4:04:37] <timetraveller2000> Kill him now and solve the problem DansGame
[4:04:42] <+evbites> imagine if joker just walked up and shot him
[4:04:43] <Razgrizenl> how far are you allowed to stream the game now or is the restriction gone
[4:04:48] <%DesuDesuDokiDoki> OwO
[4:04:48] <+daddychokemeharder> oh gash dang adults sure ar ethe worst, golle gee
[4:04:53] <timetraveller2000> @evbites best timeline
[4:04:57] <+Jp3g95> 12/24 is the alleged embargo
[4:04:58] <+UltraViolet371> That's an effing lot of treasure!
[4:05:00] <+pectusumbra> Didn't they add a creepy shiho scene to all this?
[4:05:03] <+jjjdanny> Time for horny morgana

[4:05:18] <YakumoYomi> @Razgrizenl Atlus apparently doesn't actually go after people for streaming the game
[4:05:19] <timetraveller2000> @ape_hawk at this time of the day?
[4:05:20] <%FacetiousAF> treezhor
[4:05:21] <+FakeWaifu> So as someone who didn't S Link Get Smoked or Iwai, do the gun changes just make them completely worth it?

[4:06:01] <%GeneralSCPatton> Sounds like bullshit, and I don't believe it.
[4:06:02] <%ShichiNoBushi> Make him gay for you.
[4:06:04] <%kyh9> Go ahead and say it in the back for everyone, Ryuji
[4:06:07] <timetraveller2000> @king_wolf_rigger yes Kappa
[4:06:09] <%ape_hawk> no
[4:06:12] <+neonNeptunian> MISSION SUCCESS
[4:06:19] <%BoomerUnchained> Well, that's dumb, but whatever
[4:06:24] <+Jp3g95> GO WIN GO
[4:06:25] <omen_setter> and that's when the gang realized that they were following the judgment of a cat
[4:06:25] <%bread_assassin> I'm wondering. What happens if you make the decision to send the calling card on Saturday?
[4:06:30] <kalimaruquin5> 'We needed an excuse to bring calling cards in, so here's a blockade.'
[4:06:42] <%ape_hawk> REMEMBER PAT: ONE YEAR, NO CRIMES
[4:06:42] <+daddychokemeharder> HeY GuyS Did YoU kNoW i aM a pHantOm ThiEF???
[4:06:44] <YakumoYomi> @Razgrizenl They apparently never went after anyone for the base game either
[4:06:46] <timetraveller2000> @bread_assassin I think it waits until Monday
[4:06:50] <%ShichiNoBushi> XPs to grind.
[4:06:53] <GarbageQueenEllie> @bread_assassin I did that. It still happens at school
[4:06:54] <%Diana869> ah yes the worst part of every palace now
[4:06:58] <%spiritofmojave> @bread_assassin it doesn't matter what day, it'll happen
[4:07:02] <heartlesshealer> one year [some] crimes
[4:07:04] <Ubu2933> "we knew youd rest a day to refill your shit anyways so here it's a mechanic in the game now fuckos"
[4:07:05] <+pectusumbra> Did you get the third will seed?
[4:07:07] <+Jp3g95> Level Ann?
[4:07:09] <%GabeSweetMan> psaGoblin
[4:07:10] <%superstarsage> I heard someone say there are three seeds and i think i blanked, did he get the third seed?
[4:07:11] <+Jp3g95> He got da seed
[4:07:14] <zenith0111> @fakewaifu Guns were already really strong in p5 so being able to use them every battle without thought makes them very worth it now
[4:07:15] <+FakeWaifu> He did get the seed
[4:07:15] <+NitronStreams> IYNC
[4:07:19] <Cobaltor_252> one year don't get caught
[4:07:19] <%SGrim> 1 crime, no years? woopsThink
[4:07:20] <+NitronStreams> Iync

[4:07:34] <+Daniel_Is_I> One year no convictions
[4:07:36] <+BubbaRands> NO YEAR ONE CRIME?
[4:07:39] <+Jp3g95> OH BOY, CRIMES rooH LETS DO CRIMES CHAT
[4:07:40] <%CappuccinoGuil> CRIME YEAR NO ONE
[4:07:41] <+enigmaticgear> treasure otherside of room
[4:07:42] <+neonNeptunian> one year dungeon, no trials
[4:07:43] <Meekest> @Manjove Its a victimless crime, like stealing when nobody's looking
[4:07:48] <timetraveller2000> NO ONE YEAR CRIME
[4:07:48] <Kraegeth> big crimes time
[4:07:50] <trippnout> No spoilers. Madarame's fight is so much better in Royal.
[4:07:50] <%Klefth> psaGoblin
[4:07:51] <%ShichiNoBushi> Crimes on one year.
[4:07:52] <%King_Wolf_Rigger> I like how he face plants super hard at the end of that.
[4:07:55] <GarbageQueenEllie> You think Naoto would do well in this gameplay setting? Her fighting style is very similar
[4:08:03] <%Diana869> thank god
[4:08:04] <usurper_sos> BIG mindgoblins
[4:08:04] <DexteraXIII> One year of crimes, got it.
[4:08:05] <+pectusumbra> Oh thank god
[4:08:13] <Meekest> I forgot how shit Madarame's fight was
[4:08:14] <%Dragon_Batman> Which was Madarame? the artist?
[4:08:15] <MrKerb> Has the grind improved with this version
[4:08:16] <%ape_hawk> does Kamoshida just shit and cum in his boss fight?
[4:08:17] <+pectusumbra> Interesting design but what a fucking annoying fight
[4:08:17] <%cvp5127> one crime no year
[4:08:17] <+neonNeptunian> GUN
[4:08:23] <timetraveller2000> @dragon_batman yep
[4:08:23] <+Jp3g95> One Year ALL CRIME rooH
[4:08:30] <%WhereIsWill> psaBig GUN
[4:08:31] <ScreamLord> @PatStaresAt Technically going into someone's mindscape and taking their fucked up desires away isn't a crime. Not officially
[4:08:33] <%Dragon_Batman> @timetraveller2000 aah good stuff
[4:08:36] <megaman_sentinel> so what the ability going to b if not baton pass
[4:08:39] <+evbites> 50 years of nonstop crime
[4:08:39] <%ShichiNoBushi> Year crimes on one.
[4:08:42] <%ssjklyco> Guns regen makes it easier
[4:08:43] <zenith0111> But isn't that dlc stuff?
[4:08:45] <+neonNeptunian> madarame was the artist, yeah
[4:08:46] <%bread_assassin> I don't think you really need to grind here. You're a higher level than me when I beat Kamoshida on Hard.
[4:08:47] <+Mitchellsocks> SP Patch 3 still probably best item in the game
[4:08:50] <%spiritofmojave> Year of one crimes
[4:08:51] <+daddychokemeharder> @PatStaresAt what difficulty are you playing on? this seems super easy. I just assume youve been grinding like a good little goblin
[4:08:52] <Bladeexe> Are confidants easier to work with now?
[4:08:53] <$WackyXmand> I wonder if the Devil Social link is kinda pointless to level aside from her story
[4:08:54] <timetraveller2000> @dragon_batman they changed his boss up a good bit from P5
[4:08:54] <%Diana869> HA
[4:08:54] <+Daniel_Is_I> GET HIT
[4:08:56] <+Jp3g95> KEKW

[4:09:21] <%Diana869> THAT 3 DAMAGE PogChamp
[4:09:23] <+redribbonvinny> Pat thank you for introducing me to the Yakuza series. started with 0 and am now playing Kiwami
[4:09:29] <%Alig200> @FakeWaifu its been improved in some aspects, but still drags on imo.
[4:09:32] <timetraveller2000> Surrounded by Succubuses, oh no Kreygasm
[4:09:36] <ScreamLord> @GeneralSCPatton So it is quite literally not a real crime
[4:09:37] <+Jp3g95> rcomChamp LOOKIN COOL JOKER
[4:09:38] <+FakeWaifu> that's a shame
[4:09:39] <%SilverJakler> Angel and Succubus are the same lady
[4:09:49] <+NitronStreams> 🎵🎵🎵🎵🎵🎵
[4:09:51] <+Mitchellsocks> really?
[4:09:51] <zenith0111> @rcand9 The game is easy enough to not even grind at all
[4:09:51] <%MaddyCaddy> Would be great if you did that for Arsene
[4:09:55] <%Deft_Thought> I'm glad that the original battle theme is still in
[4:09:58] <+knowyourenemy_97> Joker flex
[4:10:02] <+FakeWaifu> space station slogging...
[4:10:06] <+daddychokemeharder> God the soundtrack makes my pp the big pp
[4:10:12] <%Diana869> i didnt grind at all back in vanilla

[4:13:22] <fruit_pie_the_magician> I suggest literally everyone watch that Pruld video
[4:13:23] <%GeneralSCPatton> I might buy this, but only if you can convince me the calendar won't cause mind goblins.
[4:13:24] <+JonThePrettyOKGuy> time for us all to leave to make a statement.

[4:13:40] <%GarbageNirvana> @GeneralSCPatton I can't not guarantee it will
[4:13:41] <GarbageQueenEllie> So I can't quite tell, is Ryuji voiced by Yuri?
[4:13:41] <+NitronStreams> chat:why tho pat:*has actual panic attack on stream*
[4:13:49] <heartlesshealer> Oh shit close friendos are streaming, gonna head out
[4:13:51] <+pectusumbra> He's beating i today, he's already got the route
[4:13:57] <+bluedude153> oh my god the pruld vid is a beastars resident evil crossover
[4:13:57] <%Agami23> plague should just go "were doing star trek?" in the chat
[4:14:00] <Lobster_Lord> whats that purple explosion?
[4:14:02] <%Dragon_Batman> Have a good one Heart
[4:14:04] <%dekkitout> @GarbageQueenEllie He kinda sounds like Bocsh
[4:14:05] <timetraveller2000> @garbagequeenellie no, Yuri Lowenthal is just a couple NPCs in this
[4:14:06] <heartlesshealer> You all have a great time with dinner and Eli, Pat and Paige!
[4:14:07] <wes_ranked> OH MY BAD HAD TO WALK AWAY
[4:14:08] <%spiritofmojave> @garbagequeenellie nop different dude
[4:14:09] <+PleasantLee> I may be stuck inside with no work to go to, but I would still appreciate the Trek streams to start BEFORE midnight GMT
[4:14:15] <%reneries> I never thought of doing that. its a good idea!
[4:14:16] <Berendenn> but theyre 3 off though
[4:14:21] <%TenderBabyBacon> omg, I just saw the pruld video. It is not Beastars, it is RE-STARS 3. Which is something I didn't think I needed
[4:14:27] <%j0ustar> but why
[4:14:34] <%King_Wolf_Rigger> Why do you say Ann like that?
[4:14:36] <+Daniel_Is_I> You're gonna level up and one is gonna be 3 xp short
[4:14:38] <GarbageQueenEllie> Ryuji sounds kinda like Yuri, but with a different timbre to it. I like it a lot
[4:14:39] <zenith0111> @lobster_lord Some enemies just explode and hurt their friends now. Pretty weird if you ask me.
[4:14:42] <shiny_prinny> we thought he got a cheat dlc, but really it was goblin dlc NotLikeThis
[4:14:52] <kilbert66> Because that's how they say it in the game
[4:14:53] <rcand9> @zenith0111 when i started prestiging all the minor stats of Kassandra i was like alright im done
[4:14:54] <%majindusto> Ryuji is Max Mittelman
[4:14:55] <%Dragon_Batman> Cuz for some reason the VA's were told to pronounce shit weird
[4:15:06] <timetraveller2000> @garbagequeenellie Ryuji’s VA is one of the best in the game, the guy can really emote
[4:15:10] <$lotharrio> Mind Goblin Expansion.
[4:15:13] <zenith0111> @rcand9 LMAO damn
[4:15:18] <%reneries> Thats how they say Ann in the game, but they miss pronounce a lot of names in this game
[4:15:19] <+UltraViolet371> But it's fine because it feels good to make the goblins happy
[4:15:22] <+Jp3g95> Did the audio just change?
[4:15:27] <%Diana869> maybe the strong enemy is strong
[4:15:34] <timetraveller2000> Critical PogChamp
[4:15:35] <%GabeSweetMan> @Jp3g95 Twitch has been weird lately.
[4:15:37] <GarbageQueenEllie> @timetraveller2000 It's one of the reasons that he's a fav of mine so far, he's all around great
[4:15:40] <+GimmMeUhSammich> Need 21 more bonus xp
[4:15:41] <%cvp5127> just grind to 99
[4:15:43] <+blkalucard1> thought you couldn't stream this game?
[4:15:46] <timetraveller2000> @garbagequeenellie agreed
[4:15:48] <%shaidot> if audio changes switch off latency mode
[4:15:51] <kukstorm> PAt drop code for valorant plsz
[4:15:54] <%GabeSweetMan> uh oh
[4:15:56] <Monkeyweed21> Pat why are you like this
[4:15:56] <%Dragon_Batman> No one
[4:15:57] <Meekest> Next stream every character is max
[4:15:57] <powerprotoman> so your really excited tog et party members level elvels under you huh?
[4:15:57] <+PR0swagonist> minh max it
[4:16:01] <rcand9> @zenith0111 its a shame because it felt like a pretty good game otherwise
[4:16:03] <%Agami23> "so i did a little grinding off stream"
[4:16:03] <%spiritofmojave> "So I grinded a year off screen"
[4:16:05] <%GeneralSCPatton> @shiny_prinny How exactly does it mitigate the goblins? My purchase is riding on this.
[4:16:05] <+vampireinarm> maybe someday video game guards will get eyecare insurance, theyre all blind as all fuck
[4:16:05] <%walternatorz> have to get 99 on all characters at the same time
[4:16:07] <%Diana869> @PatStaresAt are u Minh maxing?
[4:16:08] <%GabeSweetMan> psaGoblin psaGoblin psaGoblin psaGoblin
[4:16:10] <%Hellarussian> why are you the way that you are
[4:16:11] <%walternatorz> psaGoblin psaGoblin psaGoblin
[4:16:11] <%za7az> "So I did some grinding off screen"
[4:16:14] <OldManDeckardCain> ....yeah
[4:16:14] <+Carpe_Deez_Nuts> ad someone who's seen TNG season 1 but nothing else, would I be missing major context if I tune into the Star Trek stream, or are most eps. still fairly standalone
[4:16:14] <%person181> psaGoblin psaGoblin psaGoblin psaGoblin psaGoblin
[4:16:18] <%weissguard> psaGoblin psaGoblin psaGoblin psaGoblin psaGoblin
[4:16:18] <%FacetiousAF> pat stares at: rise of the gobolins
[4:16:19] <%abusywizard> psaGoblin psaGoblin psaGoblin psaGoblin
[4:16:20] <zenith0111> @rcand9 Pacing is vital for any sort of media
[4:16:20] <+Crimsonstripe> Let the man grind!
[4:16:22] <%Manjove> why does it matter if they are even?
[4:16:22] <+Jp3g95> @shaidot thank you that works
[4:16:22] <%spiritofmojave> psaGoblin psaGoblin psaGoblin psaGoblin psaGoblin
[4:16:23] <%reneries> Baton Pass early unlock is busted in itself
[4:16:23] <+Daniel_Is_I> Thankfully I'm not as bad as pat. Just being even level is enough for me.
[4:16:28] <%bread_assassin> psaGoblin psaGoblin psaGoblin psaGoblin
[4:16:28] <%majindusto> Ryuji has the same English voice as Saitama LUL
[4:16:32] <%FacetiousAF> its a fuckin jrpg, you grind in jrpgs
[4:16:32] <+Jp3g95> rooDuck
[4:16:33] <GarbageQueenEllie> Hey man, Pesona grinding is best grinding
[4:16:36] <%Dragon_Batman> If any one wanted a case study on Neurotic tendencies then these streams are the one for you
[4:16:36] <TheGreatSunbro> What causes that explosion mechanic?
[4:16:38] <fateirony> you might as well grind to 99 now, it's probably faster than evening out everyone
[4:16:45] <zenith0111> @thegreatsunbro RNG
[4:16:51] <shiny_prinny> @GeneralSCPatton if you're having the same issue? get rid of the exp changing items if possible
[4:16:51] <TheGreatSunbro> Oh
[4:16:51] <@commanderclaw> Grind on these High School students
[4:16:52] <+the_drummaestro> It's because of the songs
[4:16:55] <+love_otter> But this isn't grinding, this is a weird obsession
[4:16:56] <+NitronStreams> Grindsona
[4:16:57] <%joylent_blue> anyone having the weird pitch bug with twitch should get FFZ, it has an option that fixes that
[4:16:57] <%spiritofmojave> except in Tartarus cause exhaustion
[4:17:01] <%FacetiousAF> the demons get a glowy bit
[4:17:02] <+Crimsonstripe> Can't waste the time given.
[4:17:02] <timetraveller2000> @garbagequeenellie I grind so I have an excuse to listen to the music Kreygasm
[4:17:02] <%dukenux> because NUMBER, right?
[4:17:03] <+UltraViolet371> @Carpe_Deez_Nuts they're fairly standalone in the first season, but it's still DS9 so you won't know the characters, setting, etc
[4:17:06] <TheGreatSunbro> Oh that's fucking sweet
[4:17:07] <xeroslash1> Pat is just John Goblikon from Nekrogoblikon
[4:17:09] <+dmtjinni> I was enjoying the podcast this morning, Thanks @PatStaresAt
[4:17:11] <+earthboy2k> Pat her help
[4:17:18] <Monkeyweed21> What about when you get Mishima's mechanic that makes your party level unevenly
[4:17:22] <+knowyourenemy_97> So basically, enemy splash damage!
[4:17:28] <%Dragon_Batman> God I'm still behind on those
[4:17:38] <fruit_pie_the_magician> @PatStaresAt It's not BEASTARS its RE-STARS 3
[4:17:38] <GarbageQueenEllie> @timetraveller2000 Even though I'm more in it for the overworld parts, I'll almost always go for a grind session
[4:17:41] <SnakeVash> There's Mind Goblins, then there's SPECTACULAR INANITY
[4:17:42] <rcand9> @zenith0111 yeps definitely hope ff7 follows its predecessors passing if not in game length, with pacing and action
[4:17:45] <kscars> I heard the streamers name is pat. hi pat
[4:17:56] <%GeneralSCPatton> @shiny_prinny Don't know what that means. I have no context. What is the goblin dlc?
[4:18:00] <timetraveller2000> @garbagequeenellie yeah, the social stuff is oddly addictive LUL

[4:18:29] <zenith0111> @rcand9 For FF7 I'm only worried about exploration since I've only seen hallway like level designs so far. But I doubt that's the case.

[4:18:42] <GarbageQueenEllie> You ever think that the reason Morgana shits on Ryuji so much is that he secretly knows that he has more of a chance with Ann than he ever will?

[4:21:54] <+twohitgood> the time differs per pot, per water situation. not to mention if you've salted the water (which lowers the boiling point). to get a timing of when water will boil, you'd need to do your own research for your pots and how much volume in each pot.

[4:30:43] <GarbageQueenEllie> That said, it's great that he's the first boss- it's so unforgivable, that you get PUMPED to kick his ass
[4:30:46] <clintonificent> the tone of the game is very P1/P2, a lot darker/more adult than P3/P4 it seems
[4:30:48] <clintonificent> SPACE

[4:32:57] <fmc009> Yeah btw, wtf does this version add?
[4:32:58] <YakumoYomi> I kinda forgot about the implied Shido rape shenanigans, probably because the game mostly zeroes in on the "his your arch nemesis" angle
[4:33:02] <%genowyn> Well I lost my vanilla disk so
[4:33:06] <%DrFacilier> oh god i hope they tweaked that bit when Morgana leaves the group cause of Ryuji
