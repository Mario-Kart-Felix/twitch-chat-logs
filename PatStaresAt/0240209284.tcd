[0:04:29] <fattness132> Warframe is a great game to play in bursts and then come back to over months
[0:04:29] <+other_badger> space robots need no food
[0:04:30] <PessimisticOptimism> Warframe is not to be witnessed. It’s mediocre

[0:04:31] <Lysdexic9541> I was playing Warframe when I got the notification LUL

[0:04:43] <%Arnschen> That's actually a big thing I like about this. I can play a bunch then set up all my stuff to be crafted while I go back to FF14 and wait.

[0:04:49] <CertainlySyrix> plague already told him about the space kids lol
[0:04:50] <jkemosabe> Honestly what my biggest enjoyment was in the little i played of the game was sheer mobility
[0:04:52] <reaperx186> rip clem link
[0:05:01] <TheImmortal70> Mobility is never old
[0:05:02] <+other_badger> plague spiled it in such a way that if you don't already know it it's not TOO much of a spoiler because it makes NO SENSE
[0:05:02] <Ethatre> plague, that spoilery fuck
[0:05:03] <@thenefftw> The thing about Warframe is that you don't have to spent a cent to play it. But the wait times make Platinum look awfully tempting

[0:21:51] <BaronVonWolfe> "You're not an Ember, you're just an asshole"

[0:22:09] <%breakfastmegapowers> Stop playing a PC game with a Controller
[0:22:10] <itsya_boi_gappy> being an asshole is fun
[0:22:13] <AMajorTom> 4 quadrants: x-axis how hard you try, y-axis how hard you demand other people try.
[0:22:19] <%a_turnt_egg> MULTIPLAYER GAMES ARE BAD
[0:22:20] <LORDSPOOKLEKINS> But pat it's not you like you ALSO pay for a sub
[0:22:22] <fruit_pie_the_magician> you can get so good at this game that carrying noobs is actually fun in and of itself
[0:22:23] <gut_punch> That's why I play solo
[0:22:23] <+JoeStillLife> I don't really agree but I get the frustration
[0:22:25] <+Verd_254> It's just like Megumin tho just different magic. They have to have their ice magic.
[0:22:25] <GN93> yeah mmo r the worst i cant play that shit
[0:22:26] <DXLelouch24> Pat how did you get PS4 controller working on PC need to know
[0:22:26] <BaronVonWolfe> @lordspooklekins Yeah, right?
[0:22:26] <Xanderkitteh> By the Way Pat your Pinned tweet says your streaming Vermintide
[0:22:27] <%Kashi_Nin> its bizarre what MMOs do to basic terms like "fun" and... "please"
[0:22:27] <Rhonne> what's wrong with WoW ice mages?
[0:22:29] <+Jigokuro> "If your method of having fun requires denying fun to everyone around you, You're an asshole no different than a deliberate troll." @AngriestPat
[0:22:29] <+skibbz_> MMO discourse NotLikeThis
[0:22:30] <Banjoboozle> And then you /kick them and then they go to the forums and cry about getting kicked from groups
[0:22:30] <+GeneSlamm> Focus on the positives, Pat
[0:22:32] <Twoiis> I'm playing for fun THOUGH
[0:22:33] <%TenderBabyBacon> @breakfastmegapowers I refuse

[0:22:34] <Pyr0_Fr0st> Played FF14 for a year never used the proper rotations
[0:22:37] <+Reaverund> Why haven't they just made a Borderlands in the style of MonHun/Destiny. Do they just hate money?
[0:22:37] <%Arnschen> I only use Flare
[0:22:37] <AzureDusk> @AngriestPat Woosaaaa Pat

[0:22:58] <CertainlySyrix> @Rhonne people trying to be ice mages in ff14, coming over from wow. apparently ice mages don't work so well in ff14 like they do in wow
[0:22:58] <%AbnormalVoid> gotta love Twinking in Dark Souls
[0:23:04] <%a_turnt_egg> PLEASE I BEG YOU
[0:23:10] <Austin0097> @AngriestPat All your asking for is a base level of competency at learning to not be a shit.
[0:23:12] <SweetCheeksTrap> I LOVE twinking!
[0:23:13] <+NiktenKing> You at least acknowledge that it's not usual behavior... but if you are a legit asshole because that's how you just play... then you are fucked
[0:23:14] <+JoeStillLife> This is why I don 't play cooperative games with strangers. Only with friends.
[0:23:14] <%breakfastmegapowers> If I could I'd play every PC game with the steel Battalion controller

[0:23:35] <+McSoliace> chaotic evil and lawful evil are way better than neutral evil

[0:23:50] <Tarkara> bitterMad bitterMad bitterMad bitterMad
[0:23:51] <Arrior_Septem> it always stops the stream on me in mobile
[0:23:51] <$OmegaWeltall> Yea it’s bad...
[0:23:51] <CrackerJack450> its fine
[0:23:52] <Kaurisen> Almost all mobile apps are completely worthless
[0:23:54] <Megiddodoge> it didn't stop. Just that everyone is bored and not talking
[0:23:56] <+JoeStillLife> Pat SHOOTS HARD on Twitch
[0:24:00] <BourneWarrior> MR. PP
[0:24:00] <%floppyfish345> Pat I'm stuck at work, you're the only thing making this worth it. Don't mess this up. jk love ya
[0:24:00] <%breakfastmegapowers> I'm not watching on PC because I like it... ba.. baka....
[0:24:01] <KTDelgado> time to help pat
[0:24:02] <+NiktenKing> it takes like 20 minutes for me to get a live notification
[0:24:02] <LokimenD> @AngriestPat so my melee only Excalibur is a no-go?
[0:24:03] <%Azarian1> It doesn't matter my card pull is on a 30 sec CD. we need it for later.
[0:24:03] <CertainlySyrix> @lumporr well he's mr2 and excalibur's on the screen, so I'm guessing just excal right now
[0:24:06] <AMajorTom> mobile app gets the job done but just barely
[0:24:06] <%Kashi_Nin> But how does that relate to stuff like the day 1 Division "bug" trolls and that one door where people would just stand in the geometry and block tutorial progression?
[0:24:07] <jastrouble97> @lumporr lokks like excal or ash
[0:24:08] <babblingcabbage> @angriestpat its your fault you can't keep up with the ice mages
[0:24:08] <%captainthunderwolf> @McSoliace Nah man, True Evil is literally evil for evil's own sake. If you're gonna be an asshole, that's the true power.
[0:24:09] <%a_turnt_egg> Nice Dadaist shirt, Pat

[0:24:18] <denam_of_windscale> Why the fuck would you use the mobile app
[0:24:19] <%badmr7> Oh my password is incorrect, really? Cause I JUST FUCKING ENTERED IT 2 SECONDS AGO AND YOU SAID OKAY
[0:24:20] <StarSkullyman> I'm watching you on mobile right now and I got no issues

[0:24:47] <AngryPhant0m> why is he playing warframe
[0:24:49] <%President_Miyazaki> @AngriestPat Its funny how all of this stemmed from you being wrong about Woolie's Lance against Pink Rathian.
[0:24:52] <+Ches_Neckbeard> didn't Paige start to play kingdom hearts?
[0:24:54] <sunriser696> liam streamed the whole thing

[0:25:48] <%Slayer875> @AngriestPat You excited for the changes coming in the Mon Hun update?
[0:25:49] <+Saltima> 20 minutes trying to get an item he could of got later is infuriating
[0:25:49] <%Mornaka> cheer200 somehow i knew i could be a half hour late and miss nothing

[0:25:59] <Tarkara> @AngriestPat The people below me say that my typing sound like rumbling and my computer sounds like an engine. What do?
[0:26:00] <%ThatGuyfromMars> probably because there are more fun kh games like BBS and KH2
[0:26:00] <reaperx186> 4 more days until pickles
[0:26:01] <%Valask> god dammit
[0:26:02] <@thenefftw> Let it set in super hard

[0:26:08] <outis94> @AngriestPat witch form or dragon?
[0:26:09] <chaosbuckle> You're not my real dad, Pat! You can't tell me what to do!
[0:26:11] <gut_punch> That's fair
[0:26:16] <+TeethMuncher> A billion contents
[0:26:20] <Worldbrand> It is 100% natural to take breaks from Warframe
[0:26:21] <%captainthunderwolf> Hey Pat, how does it feel to know you'll never be able to beat Bayonetta 3 when it comes out because you'll be crippled by age?
[0:26:25] <tremerss> itll only be 2000 hours of game time
[0:26:26] <%Kashi_Nin> How Popcorn is warframe? relative to other games in its category
[0:26:26] <keiji_maede> what the fuck is this?! Is pat really playing warframe?
[0:26:26] <fruit_pie_the_magician> HA GOOD LUCK
[0:26:30] <+ruddyredbone> at least its not wow
[0:26:31] <+preppyposs> 20 HOURS
[0:26:32] <sunriser696> warframe content has a longer shelf life
[0:26:32] <+shinpete> 20 minutes without a button? Must be the DSP technique LUL

[0:26:34] <blacksoap65> Is Pat playing Warframe with controller or K/M?
[0:26:36] <%Larshas> This is all Plague's fault

[0:26:44] <KingOfTheGeats> just noticed Pat's frame has the space pimple
[0:26:45] <tangoragahn> Warframe has content updates every 2 weeks more or less
[0:26:46] <Louie_Salmon> Uh oh

[0:26:53] <Worldbrand> Even my 4000 hours started out as an accidental 20
[0:26:53] <lupianwolf> When's Dauntless Pat?
[0:26:53] <StarSkullyman> 20 ain't bad
[0:26:55] <TheSpartanThief> Pat, you don't accidentally spend 20 hours in Warframe....it DEMANDS it.

[0:27:59] <LORDSPOOKLEKINS> 1200 hours boi.I took a long break too.
[0:27:59] <aversalammar> 12 hours
[0:27:59] <Volkrotia> Warframe is as obscurely popular and insanely good as MonHun
[0:28:04] <+Verd_254> I burned myself at work last week with a soldering iron. It hurt.
[0:28:04] <keiji_maede> pat is the only nub here! He just started

[0:28:08] <CertainlySyrix> Don't think that's still a thing anymore @CommandThrowChavo

[0:28:09] <fruit_pie_the_magician> 2400 hours
[0:28:11] <%SolitaryDrake> @AngriestPat How are you going to balance Warframe and MonHun since they're both loot-based action games?
[0:28:12] <chaosbuckle> Have you been hit with Clem memes yet?
[0:28:14] <%commanderclaw> and now you cut yourself for fun
[0:28:16] <%a_turnt_egg> Pat tried to fuck a box cutter
[0:28:17] <%Remery_> :)
[0:28:18] <%Svanyr> Always cut away
[0:28:19] <Katalist_> put it all in 1 bag but dont make it heavy
[0:28:21] <%LGWPhanto> I take like, 6 month breaks and I keep comin' back to it eventually.

[0:28:23] <%Mornaka> working at a food lion in the meat dep. i cut my hand on the band saw
[0:28:23] <+Jigokuro> I worked with a box cutter for years and never cut myself. You might just be shit.
[0:28:23] <gut_punch> That's very debatable
[0:28:24] <luckysoulrumble> I thought my 100 hours in Witcher 3 was a lot...
[0:28:25] <chaosbuckle> Clem? Clem!

[0:28:37] <keiji_maede> he's playing on pc, right?
[0:28:39] <TruTrashMan> Man, someone at my work recently used a boxcutter to open a box full of BAGS OF LIQUID CARAMEL. Boxcutters ruin lives.

[0:41:28] <legendarysabertooth> Pat where did you hide fuggins? In the couch like Scott Steiner?
[0:41:29] <+McSoliace> i didn't even know you could paint the interior

[0:41:57] <zakti_prime> idle stance is warframe appearance
[0:41:57] <YautjaBorne> black with red or purple you monster
[0:41:58] <@thenefftw> @AngriestPat Doing the pet quest isn't something that you should bother with for now. Looking it up online says it's basically a trap for new players
[0:41:59] <Biscuitsfordays> CLEM!!
[0:42:00] <hecadisth> you can do the exterior too
[0:42:00] <+OranHexthief> do outside of ship @AngriestPat
[0:42:01] <%Bloko07> IT BEGINS
[0:42:02] <AzureSkyKnight> Paint the outside too
[0:42:06] <Wobble9000> Do outside
[0:42:07] <Worldbrand> Kubrows are a credit trap, get the incubator upgrade segment first

[0:42:08] <Asama_2> @angriestpat what is the gold color?
[0:42:09] <TyrantBelial> @AngriestPat Now go back to Landing cratf, and color the outside of your ship!
[0:42:09] <+augurgewalt> CLEM!!
[0:42:10] <cizal11> don't try to grow your dog it's expensive and kind of bad
[0:42:11] <chaosbuckle> Will your dog son be square too?
[0:42:13] <zakti_prime> argon
[0:42:13] <Ixiah> NOOO KAVAT FOR LIFE
[0:42:13] <+superkeaton> Kubrow are useless in my opinion
[0:42:14] <+Hinasil> Can't wait until he gets to his operator
[0:42:14] <%TaifuDragon> @AngriestPat Argon crystal, yeah?
[0:42:14] <+preppyposs> argon crytals are in the void
[0:42:14] <+AcidicHorizon> Argonj crystal?
[0:42:16] <reaperx186> @AngriestPat 100k credits
[0:42:16] <+MarshallLee67> you need to get argon crystal from a place called the void
[0:42:17] <Volkrotia> its like 100k credits to make dont worry about it
[0:42:19] <Banjoboozle> Fast and easy, just like Pat
[0:42:19] <+deadpalvgz> @AngriestPat to get the incubation core you need argon which is in the void, I can taxi you
[0:42:19] <jinkipng> i feed my dog he is growing powerful
[0:42:20] <fattness132> argon crystals are in the void - later area than where you're at
[0:42:20] <ckbooks> I incubate my son he is becoming powerful.
[0:42:22] <+augurgewalt> argon crystals
[0:42:22] <LORDSPOOKLEKINS> @AngriestPat argon crystals are something you can't get until you get to the void
[0:42:23] <%LGWPhanto> Hell yeah, look at all those Oberon parts
[0:42:23] <+preppyposs> ITS IN THE VOID
[0:42:26] <+deadpalvgz> Oh I can taxi you for that
[0:42:27] <+preppyposs> oooooh
[0:42:27] <@WoolyFish> Show me your incubation core, girl.
[0:42:27] <+AcidicHorizon> oh
[0:42:27] <+Golinvoxx> check the galaxy map
[0:42:27] <around_40_jobbers> his foundry is so.... empty....
[0:42:28] <%Bloko07> dang
[0:42:28] <arcadeHemorrhage > CLEM!
[0:42:28] <Cobaltor_252> pat do yourself a favour and turn off motion blur
[0:42:28] <+MarshallLee67> oh rip
[0:42:30] <zakti_prime> nooo
[0:42:30] <corn_on_fire> oh god the camera is so close, is that normal?
[0:42:31] <cizal11> those are way later
[0:42:32] <LORDSPOOKLEKINS> oh nbm
[0:42:32] <NemokillerV> welp
[0:42:32] <BaronVonWolfe> Half of my many hours in warframe have been spent making my stuff look extra shiny.
[0:42:32] <+alphonseisbest> how many hours pat into warframe now?
[0:42:33] <%Fenrirlives> @AngriestPat did you go into the STD room yet?
[0:42:33] <%TaifuDragon> ohhh
[0:42:33] <$Jayschroo> is this one of those games where you should always have the wiki open
[0:42:35] <ovan20> @AngriestPat
[0:42:35] <KTDelgado> goto saturn
[0:42:36] <+Ultimatefool> Earliest is like...Jupiter I think?
[0:42:36] <jastrouble97> bet its argon
[0:42:36] <Crippl3> Nano Spores come from some later planets like the Void
[0:42:37] <Everpresent_Overseer> Derelict to get a million
[0:42:37] <CertainlySyrix> Keep getting through planets and you'll get shit tons of nano spores without even trying @AngriestPat
[0:42:37] <Rogue657> @AngriestPat Nano spores come from later planets, look at what each planet drops in the star map
[0:42:38] <+superkeaton> Get nano spores on infested missions
[0:42:38] <+AcidicHorizon> One of the planets
[0:42:39] <+Golinvoxx> each planet shows you what resources you can get on it
[0:42:40] <%Bloko07> I have a over a 1,000,000
[0:42:40] <tangoragahn> Saturn
[0:42:40] <+Javaa01> Infested planets
[0:42:41] <vaan_ratsbane> the early nanospore grind ugh
[0:42:41] <cizal11> it'll be a little while before you can get those
[0:42:41] <+AJ_Cherenkov> just keep working the starmap, you'll get them eventually
[0:42:41] <chaosbuckle> Nano spores become pretty common after awhile.
[0:42:42] <%LGWPhanto> Saturn
[0:42:44] <JohnnyMedia> @angriestpat how much more powerful has doggo grown?
[0:42:45] <WaiL_FiN> I color code everything default magenta and that light purple-grey
[0:42:46] <Volkrotia> Maroo's bazaar can sometimes give u a mission that has Nano spores
[0:42:46] <+boredpantz> Has Pat done the second dream yet?
[0:42:46] <AzureSkyKnight> On an infestation planet
[0:42:47] <TyrantBelial> You get it from later missions
[0:42:47] <Twoiis> Redbull #2.
[0:42:48] <+ccwettr123> nano spores are EXTREMELY common a bit later
[0:42:49] <LORDSPOOKLEKINS> How do you have argon and not nano spores?
[0:42:49] <fruit_pie_the_magician> somebody drag pat to eris
[0:42:49] <+deadpalvgz> Please turn off motion blur the game look so much better than that
[0:42:50] <ovan20> @AngriestPat nano spore are common materials, you get on every mission
[0:42:50] <EpicQuest> @AngriestPat If you go to your star chart map it shows you what items drop on what planets
[0:42:52] <@PlagueOfGripes> ah, early game farming problems
[0:42:53] <+Phobaws06> Derelict or saturn
[0:42:53] <love_plays> nano spores, son
[0:42:53] <aeonicvector> @AngriestPat Saturn is the earliest iirc
[0:42:53] <Dairaipie> the fucked thing im now playing Warframe due to plague...
[0:42:55] <+leontalon> Blur is the worst
[0:42:55] <+dolvusman76> And 100k credits
[0:42:56] <NemokillerV> @AngriestPat you get them from the techno zombies
[0:42:56] <reaperx186> pat look at those credits needed
[0:42:57] <+celestian22> I am already so lost
[0:42:57] <OceanGovernor> You can paint the outside of your ship pat @AngriestPat
[0:42:58] <tangoragahn> Saturn and the derelict
[0:42:58] <MonsieurHedge> !INFESTED!
[0:43:01] <%Ablestron> @AngriestPat DO YOU sir, want an infested alien doggo instead of a normal doggo? If you hang out with a person using the Nidus frame, you get a boil on your frames neck that can be drained onto your incubating kubro egg
[0:43:03] <%serpenttucker> @AngriestPat Pat the biggest recommendation I can ever give you is to unlock EVERY node ASAP
[0:43:03] <ZepToYourStep> look at the planets botom righht shows what can drop
[0:43:04] <zakti_prime> mercury
[0:43:08] <+unfoldingchoas> on the map it shows you what the planet has
[0:43:08] <WaiL_FiN> wtf where'd you get all that plat?
[0:43:09] <KTDelgado> go to satur pat
[0:43:12] <Grayhammatter> @AngriestPat paint the outside of your shi[
[0:43:16] <+augurgewalt> nano spores are dumb because you need to go through half of the starchart before you can get them, after that they are common as hell
[0:43:16] <AzureSkyKnight> @AngriestPat Paint the outside too
[0:43:17] <@thenefftw> Gold is a great color
[0:43:21] <billyaniki69> oh god why would you ever have motion blur on? it makes everything look like shit.
[0:43:24] <TyrantBelial> @AngriestPat Now color the outside of your ship!
[0:43:24] <Grayhammatter> ship*
[0:43:24] <%IllusionKiller522> @AngriestPat you can find what the planets resource drop is in the bottom right corner when you select a planet
[0:43:25] <+preppyposs> clan key???
[0:43:25] <Solidus_113> @AngriestPat take your clan key out of the foundry and come on down
[0:43:25] <arcadeHemorrhage > does he have the space ads yet?
[0:43:25] <TheSpartanThief> @AngriestPat Earliest planet is Saturn, but you get LOTS!
[0:43:26] <Asama_2> @angriestpat what is the gold color?
[0:43:27] <s_snowball> does he know he has space aids
[0:43:27] <EpicQuest> @AngriestPat Go to start chart look in the bottom right corner it shows you the stuff that drops on that planet
[0:43:28] <+MarshallLee67> pat jjust be aware- argon crystals decay over a 24 hour period so you might need to re-farm them once you get the nano spores @AngriestPat
[0:43:29] <Wobble9000> Paint outside the ship
[0:43:30] <+alphonseisbest> what frame he using?
[0:43:30] <faegbeard> CLAN KEY
[0:43:33] <Volkrotia> BOLTOR
[0:43:36] <MonsieurHedge> is oberon still trash, or can he finally heal gud?
[0:43:36] <alebeard> is there a TBF clan?
[0:43:37] <+fireking900> blue white and gold is great
[0:43:37] <tangoragahn> A clan? oWo
[0:43:38] <+Shmango65> @alphonseisbest excal
[0:43:39] <+AcidicHorizon> The systems
[0:43:39] <+ruddyredbone> lets see the clan
[0:43:39] <@WoolyFish> This is already confusing.
[0:43:39] <pswayde> @AngriestPat check your in-game inbox as well as your friends list, plz.
[0:43:40] <zakti_prime> Oberon is a great frame for new players!
[0:43:40] <+Golinvoxx> @AngriestPat why grow dog when you could grow cat?
[0:43:41] <+JackDemon316> bolter is really freaking good low level
[0:43:43] <fruit_pie_the_magician> neckball dislodges the mutant door
[0:43:48] <Biscuitsfordays> Oberon the rarest warframe
[0:43:50] <%TaifuDragon> Plastids are an infested drop as well
[0:43:50] <Volkrotia> Dey on Phobos
[0:43:50] <Crippl3> You can get Plastids on Mars, I think?
[0:43:51] <Ixiah> ask the ingame chat for rhino, the bot will tell you
[0:43:51] <+preppyposs> he already has oberon stuff?
[0:43:51] <Worldbrand> Just keep progressing along the starchart

[0:45:04] <%TaifuDragon> @AngriestPat Those are general rewards from harvesting. Nano spores drop from missions with infested in them

[0:45:25] <sunriser696> GET PLAGUE ON THE CALL
[0:45:25] <morcego_cinzento> To this day, my mind is still blown out of my asshole, that the creators of Warframe started with Dark Sektor as the Warframe prototype

[0:45:26] <%CrimsonCore90> Join a player and they can planet body you
[0:45:29] <%TaifuDragon> They are just a drop from infested

[0:49:25] <%serpenttucker> @AngriestPat You can buy all that shit now. You don't need clan affinity.
[0:49:25] <+AcidicHorizon> Low Key I am
[0:49:25] <Rogue657> @AngriestPat "Clan affinity" is just how much completing research upped the clan's rating, you don't spend anything yourself on that
[0:49:27] <percibot> @AngriestPat You don't need affinity to buy those! just credits :D
[0:49:28] <%President_Miyazaki> He-Ma
[0:49:29] <thelonechris> I don't know what's going on either

[0:50:00] <AnimeJedi25> You and me are on the same wavelength Pat.
[0:50:01] <KingSpunf> I can sell you a Helios Prime set if you're on PC...
[0:50:01] <Primary_> the labs allow clan members to contribute resources to research blueprints that are exclusive to clans, you can just steal them now that they did the hard work @angriestpat
[0:50:03] <+Jigokuro> maroStaryn
[0:50:05] <reonome> whats this weeb shit
[0:50:05] <+Qwertoqwerto> Carrier is better boy

[0:50:07] <JWright2396> so pretty
[0:50:07] <TheSpartanThief> And very later on, OPTICOR! KING OF RIFLES!
[0:50:07] <Worldbrand> This dojo is surprisingly barren for a clan of that size
[0:50:09] <+Jigokuro> naroStaryn
[0:50:09] <LocoCrazy_> Hey @angriestpat did you see the fighting mini game DE is working on?
[0:50:11] <Grayhammatter> that's pretty
[0:50:11] <+FragmentNation> this weeb shit
[0:50:11] <@PlagueOfGripes> I'm leveling Lanka right now actually
[0:50:12] <+D_west> metal gear rising Weeb room?
[0:50:14] <%captainthunderwolf> @thenefftw Maybe this is more "organized cult", then, but that was more "these people are going to kill me now".
[0:50:14] <TyrantBelial> @AngriestPat Any weapon in the Dojo with research complete you can just purchase the BP from them immediately. So get BP's for the weapons you want.
[0:50:15] <Crippl3> @AngriestPat The Dojo labs have blueprints for a lot of the most popular weapons and frames, so save up some credits and buy the blueprints from the lab
[0:50:21] <BaronVonWolfe> @angriestpat , have you seen that simulacrum yet?
[0:50:24] <Agami23> this looks like the begening of monsoons zone
[0:50:26] <MattPlainview> Warframe seems like a well developed game with player-friendly business practices. I just really don't like the armor & weapon designs. Anyone else?
[0:50:29] <aslfrasle> Instead of "Pat Stares at Warframe" it should be "Pat's Confused by Warframe."
[0:50:31] <Rhonne> pat joined the klan?
[0:50:31] <OceanGovernor> Im a little surprised the whole clan is not following him doing silly emotes
[0:50:32] <$SGrim> PAT JOINS THE KLAN???
[0:50:33] <Rogue657> Vaccuum is on all pets, carrier isn't the tops anymore
[0:50:35] <zakti_prime> there's a lot of rooms just for being pretty, not any real purpose
[0:50:37] <@WoolyFish> Exposed them for space weebs
[0:50:37] <+TeethMuncher> "Pat Joins the Clan"
[0:50:37] <reonome> @MattPlainview yeah same
[0:50:37] <@PlagueOfGripes> they JUST added tons of dojo stuff
[0:50:39] <+ruddyredbone> it just got a new update
[0:50:40] <TheImmortal70> Void traces and ayatan stars, what do you do with them?
[0:50:44] <%captainthunderwolf> @MattPlainview I like it, but I feel like a lot of the armors are overdesigned.
[0:50:45] <+celestian22> this is exactly what I would expect pats den to look like
[0:50:49] <@thenefftw> Waow

[0:51:26] <MrDrayko> @TamsynRRD yes
[0:51:28] <percibot> @TamsynRRD the warframes are basically power armor. you learn more about them as you do story quests, however
[0:51:31] <Ace_Kuper> @AngriestPat So how is controller gameplay treating you? It seems good.
[0:51:33] <+SpookySpaghooti> @TamsynRRD from a lore perspective they're like remote controlled puppets

[0:54:48] <zakti_prime> dojo can be huuuuge
[0:54:48] <@thenefftw> NANI
[0:54:49] <thelonechris> This place is fucking massive
[0:54:53] <+tigerfang86> BIG ZONES
[0:54:54] <Grayhammatter> must be the woolie hole
[0:54:54] <Rentixx> Power supply basement probably
[0:54:55] <percibot> holy shit this dojo is gigantic
[0:54:57] <edited156> Pat is going to be lost forever
[0:55:00] <Rentixx> yeah
[0:55:01] <$drbuttss> It's so cute to see pat being confused
[0:55:01] <chaosbuckle> Welcome to Clan Dojo Island. *insert music and wonder*
[0:55:01] <@PlagueOfGripes> Pat you can have tons of rooms. It may go on forever
[0:55:02] <CertainlySyrix> travel on down the woolie hole
[0:55:03] <reiju_22> what is this place? never saw it when I played
[0:55:03] <%a_turnt_egg> STAR wars shit
[0:55:03] <KTDelgado> NEED REACTORS
[0:55:05] <legendarysabertooth> A door to nowhere
[0:55:05] <+celestian22> wtf it can have 9 floors @Worldbrand ?!
[0:55:06] <%Remery_> The Sexnasium
[0:55:08] <%a_turnt_egg> duel of the fates shit
[0:55:08] <+OranHexthief> they just added a bunch of dojo stuff too
[0:55:11] <jastrouble97> and its all customizable
[0:55:12] <+ruddyredbone> I've never explored my whole dojo
[0:55:12] <Jaxterpeace> pat was never heard from again
[0:55:13] <%Hilleltaco> Is there actually any practical use for this much space or is it for fun?
[0:55:13] <legendarysabertooth> Elevator the game
[0:55:24] <+CapnCarnivore> @AngriestPat I see you have the Taxon sentinel - not a bad choice. However, the Carrier sentinel should be your next choice because it will auto-collect pickups for you at a much longer range
[0:55:24] <aeonicvector> Sppoky basment filled with generators
[0:55:25] <Worldbrand> @celestian22 I was exaggerating, but it definitely has at least 6
[0:55:25] <CertainlySyrix> @Hilleltaco research rooms are important
[0:55:26] <KingSpunf> Tenno Fuckatorium
[0:55:26] <arfsm95> @AngriestPat the labs have blueprints that the dojo researched, and you can buy them and make them in your ship
[0:55:36] <Valkyrjsen> This basically seems like the basement where the generators are. LUL
[0:55:41] <+MarshallLee67> for the most part you just need the labs to get weapons n shit @AngriestPat
[0:55:42] <chaosbuckle> Ehhh...I mainly just go there for the blueprints.
[0:55:42] <Louie_Salmon> Because it's SO BIG
[0:55:42] <+deadpalvgz> I just built every single room in my dojo because I could.
[0:55:43] <+gozzojt27> because the F A R M
[0:55:44] <tangoragahn> Has he found a dueling room yet?
[0:55:44] <gut_punch> WOof again
[0:55:45] <CertainlySyrix> @Hilleltaco you can also access a lot of your ship functions from here, loadouts and navigation n shit
[0:55:47] <$GohanEgret> s p o o k
[0:55:48] <thelonechris> Probably because you would get lost forever
[0:55:48] <+ruddyredbone> infinite rooms
[0:55:48] <$drbuttss> Go to the sex dungeon pat
[0:55:48] <+tigerfang86> BIG SPOOK ZONE
[0:55:49] <Megiddodoge> Well of course you can make cool stuff. Gotta make up for all the content DE didn't make.
[0:55:49] <Quietshun13> I only need the labs
[0:55:50] <aeonicvector> @CapnCarnivore not true anymore, all sentinels can use vaccum now
[0:55:50] <Imperium78> Bug spooks
[0:55:51] <Dairaipie> i can see why
[0:55:54] <%Ele_On_A_Uni> @CapnCarnivore all sentinels can do that now actually
[0:55:57] <outis94> look a bit like artorias
[0:55:58] <%LostDais> Everyone get comfy were´re going to be here for a while.
[0:56:04] <+CapnCarnivore> @aeonicvector oh, shit, really? that's dope @Ele_On_A_Uni
[0:56:06] <+preppyposs> I really want an invite to this clan now
[0:56:08] <Jaxterpeace> having a 1 person dojo seems alot more manageable
[0:56:12] <arfsm95> @AngriestPat the labs have blueprints that the dojo researched, and you can buy them and make them in your ship
[0:56:13] <jastrouble97> cause i dont care if it dosent get me new frames or weapons
[0:56:14] <Worldbrand> ... you mean anubis?
[0:56:22] <fruit_pie_the_magician> nice
[0:56:25] <sassyquatch963> do we know what his in-game-name is so we can add him and give him dumb gifts?
[0:56:28] <+Pendlez> what frame pat?
[0:56:33] <OfficialTimothy> @Megiddodoge Bad day? lol
[0:56:35] <thelonechris> It's still growing
[0:56:38] <Rogue657> IGN is AngriestPat afaik
[0:56:38] <HexMasterMike> I've played this game off and on for almost four years now and I don't think I've ever done anything with clans
[0:56:39] <jastrouble97> @pendlez excal
[0:56:39] <CertainlySyrix> He's on Excalibur right now @Pendlez
[0:56:40] <@thenefftw> This is one spooky basement
[0:56:42] <zakti_prime> door symbols indicate the room inside
[0:56:44] <love_plays> if it's not AngriestPat we're all screwed
[0:56:47] <+celestian22> alright im in time to get addicted
[0:56:47] <%Arnschen> "little"
[0:56:48] <OceanGovernor> I feed my dojo and it grows larger
[0:56:49] <AzureDusk> Is this original Warframe?
[0:56:49] <%TaifuDragon> @AngriestPat there's another floor
[0:56:50] <sassyquatch963> @Pendlez looks like excalibur, with the dex skin
[0:56:51] <Grayhammatter> too spooky
[0:56:54] <chaosbuckle> Yeah, Pat. tell us your name so we can spam you with fake argon crystals.

[0:57:09] <+ruddyredbone> pvp
[0:57:10] <Crippl3> @AngriestPat Once you get some credits together, hit up the Bio, Tenno, and Energy labs and buy some weapon and warframe blueprints, there's some very powerful ones
[0:57:10] <zakti_prime> obstacle room there

[0:57:14] <chaosbuckle> THERE IS NO MERCY IN THIS DOJO
[0:57:15] <+CapnCarnivore> @AngriestPat so, you picked Excal? Niiiice. He's one of the better DPS frames ATM
[0:57:16] <+Pendlez> press x to yugioh

[0:57:24] <EpicQuest> Better then Playstation Home?
[0:57:27] <%Remery_> MMO's are jealous
[0:57:27] <+unfoldingchoas> fight clan members
[0:57:27] <arcadeHemorrhage > warframe is an MMO

[0:57:43] <reaperx186> @AngriestPat so the thing about dojo rooms,you unlock rooms,by having a lower tier room in the dojo somewhere,and every room cost energy so you people make nowhere rooms to unlock pretty rooms and a giant corridors filled with energy generator rooms
[0:57:44] <@thenefftw> Maximum Space
[0:57:46] <$drbuttss> I thought it was an mmo

[0:58:35] <Rogue657> @AngriestPat there was a glitch with obstacle courses where you could just jump backwards and finish it in less than a second
[0:58:36] <Mittensbro> They broke this a long time ago with bullet jumping, it's broken now
[0:58:37] <+migofrompluto> They used Speednova or Titania probably :P

[1:01:03] <TyrantBelial> Automod instalsl worthless mods as it has bad priority system
[1:01:04] <CertainlySyrix> He just started the game so auto install will probably be fine until he figures out what he's doing
[1:01:06] <C_game_me_811> auto install doodSteve
[1:01:06] <Worldbrand> Auto Install just picks your most expensive mods regardless of actual worth
[1:01:06] <+mechokk> so whats pats progress, what character is he playing and how much money has he spent?
[1:01:07] <KTDelgado> ALWAYS MANUEL INSTALL
[1:01:11] <Rogue657> @AngriestPat Auto install is totally fine for now because he doesn't have any good mods yet

[1:05:49] <%Gogogolem> @AngriestPat Tiatanias quest takes like 100 hours
[1:05:49] <El_Samio> but her quest is a pain in the butt
[1:05:49] <+Ultimatefool> @AngriestPat Her quest is kind of annoying to complete
[1:05:50] <Nilysila> Titania is a quest frame
[1:05:50] <pswayde> you get Titania through a quest
[1:05:51] <cizal11> she's part of an optional questline you probably won't get to for awhile.
[1:05:51] <LORDSPOOKLEKINS> She's a quest fra,e
[1:05:51] <AzureSkyKnight> Story based frame
[1:05:51] <love_plays> @AngriestPat disregard these suckers, Titania is insanely powerful and her quest sucks
[1:05:51] <Rentixx> is pat experiencing the downside of this game which is the overly friendly and gifting community? Kappa
[1:05:52] <TanktopNerd> Keep her
[1:05:52] <@PlagueOfGripes> she's not particularly good, so it saves you some trouble at least
[1:05:53] <corn_on_fire> wait why does it come in a normal ass regular Christmas gift box
[1:05:53] <BooitsDock> people that says titania is garbage are dumb
[1:05:53] <+MarshallLee67> titania is a quest frame and you need to do a ton of scanning for shit- YOU MUST EXPERIENCE THAT PAIN, DELETE TITANIA
[1:05:54] <aeonicvector> a decent bit, she's the furthest out framwise atm
[1:05:54] <$SGrim> @AngriestPat Tit-ah-nea SwiftRage
[1:05:54] <jastrouble97> just take it it dosent really matter
[1:05:55] <LORDSPOOKLEKINS> frame*
[1:05:55] <%Gogogolem> @AngriestPat Its not fun
[1:05:56] <gut_punch> she is easy to get but shit without great mods
[1:05:56] <+Brownsugar579> Sell her getting frames is most of the game
[1:05:57] <korean_random> leave it
[1:05:57] <tangoragahn> Keep her, she's not good
[1:05:58] <Supabait> titania is obtained through a questline that is time-gated and unfun
[1:05:58] <+Phobaws06> keep her
[1:05:59] <%serpenttucker> @AngriestPat People want you to sell frames and weapons because the Grind for them IS THE GAMEPLAY
[1:05:59] <+SpookySpaghooti> @AngriestPat Titania is kinda a bitch too get
[1:05:59] <Grayhammatter> keep her
[1:05:59] <Worldbrand> You can't know what you're being gifted unless they tell you in their message.
[1:06:00] <hecadisth> delete you get her from a quest later
[1:06:00] <%IllusionKiller522> @AngriestPat is fucking annoying to get
[1:06:01] <reaperx186> @AngriestPat titania uses 1 annoying drop rate material for all her parts
[1:06:01] <OceanGovernor> her quest is ez pz so just dump her
[1:06:04] <KTDelgado> IF YOJ DONT WANT HE GIFT DONT ACCEPT IT
[1:06:04] <MrDrayko> The latest 6-7 frames are locked behind storyprogression, and then rare drops after @AngriestPat
[1:06:05] <TanktopNerd> Her 4 is her best ability, you build around it
[1:06:05] <chaosbuckle> Delete her so you'll have to suffer through her quest for parts like we did. >:(
[1:06:07] <%President_Miyazaki> Just get rid of it and say the words "Don't send me weapons and frames"
[1:06:07] <TanktopNerd> tiny archwing frame
[1:06:08] <El_Samio> She FLIES, that's all her bullshit
[1:06:08] <ThissisAwesome> Pat, you are using the same skin and color scheme I am...
[1:06:08] <%GarbageNirvana> She's a fairy
[1:06:08] <+mechokk> oh thats a weird looking one
[1:06:08] <GiantRobort> titania is super grindy to get but not hard
[1:06:08] <BaronVonWolfe> Just keep her but don't use her until you do her quest, The Silver Grove.
[1:06:09] <OfficialTimothy> She possibly has the worst quest to get a warframe
[1:06:10] <+unfoldingchoas> titain is a quest line to get
[1:06:10] <suikudo> Titania is fantastic are you nuts!?
[1:06:11] <%a_turnt_egg> i didnt know pat's mom was in this game
[1:06:12] <Imperium78> Unlocked the worst ending
[1:06:12] <Ixiah> the irish frame
[1:06:12] <tangoragahn> She's a fairy
[1:06:12] <%Shmango65> @AngriestPat She flies around like a little pixie
[1:06:12] <KingSpunf> Just ignore for now. It'll be hours until you can get her anyways
[1:06:13] <+Ondartyr> Pat can't possibly hold all this content
[1:06:13] <@PlagueOfGripes> she is a magic pixie.
[1:06:13] <Everpresent_Overseer> She becomes smol
[1:06:14] <fruit_pie_the_magician> FAIRIES
[1:06:14] <+ruddyredbone> dies
[1:06:16] <+Phobaws06> level her up, if you dont like her, sell it
[1:06:16] <Highwang> titania's an alien pixie that flies
[1:06:17] <%Njs10> @AngriestPat you can turn off gifting in settings, you were on it. it's under gameplay, you can set it to either get gifts from anyone, friends only, or none at all
[1:06:17] <+augurgewalt> flying, killing everything in front of her
[1:06:17] <+babyacid> sell the frame
[1:06:18] <$redqueenrunning> titania is the bug sexbot
[1:06:18] <PhantaniumOG> I would just turn off accepting gifts part of the fun is earning the stuff yourself
[1:06:18] <zakti_prime> She has big lore in her quest, but is somewhat annoying to get
[1:06:21] <Volkrotia> A mediocre DPS/Support
[1:06:22] <+Jigokuro> Look fuckin weird is a thing that she do.
[1:06:23] <Aleate> Literally the Pixie Frame
[1:06:23] <+migofrompluto> Titania is a story frame and can be a pain in the ass to do. Though isn't a BAD frame
[1:06:24] <ThissisAwesome> Tih-tonya
[1:06:25] <arcadeHemorrhage > SHE FLYS
[1:06:26] <+superkeaton> Titania is excellent
[1:06:26] <El_Samio> Titania's whole shtick is her 4, Razorwing
[1:06:27] <%nman9> keep it, dont let that persons sacrifice go to waste
[1:06:27] <Rogue657> @AngriestPat If you sell her you keep the warframe slot from her
[1:06:28] <%Fenrirlives> Titania's a cute!
[1:06:28] <+NiktenKing> FLY
[1:06:29] <knomad2b> she looks cool tho
[1:06:29] <%Gogogolem> @AngriestPat Magic pixie pat
[1:06:30] <%commanderclaw> Don't you believe in fairies?
[1:06:31] <cizal11> that's accurate
[1:06:31] <tangoragahn> She's a fairy queen from Shakespeare
[1:06:33] <MonsieurHedge> Tribute works like Kinsects, @AngriestPat
[1:06:34] <legendarysabertooth> Another strimmer I like is playing the David Cage the search for child
[1:06:35] <TanktopNerd> shes a fantastic plains of eiolodon frame
[1:06:37] <love_plays> @AngriestPat Titania's 4 can rip Eidolon Teralysts to shreds man
[1:06:38] <Jaxterpeace> shes a fairy... she goes tiny and flys
[1:06:39] <chaosbuckle> You can go tiny and fuck things up
[1:06:41] <outis94> she is a fairy
[1:06:42] <Worldbrand> Titania's CC/DPS. Her buffs aren't great.
[1:06:43] <%LGWPhanto> Titania almost requires her Razorwing augment to be super good.
[1:06:44] <%Remery_> Support?
[1:06:45] <+Comradeiota> I fucking love Titania
[1:06:46] <gut_punch> She isn't great and you need great mods @AngriestPat
[1:06:52] <GyroBrando> wtf pats already cheating
[1:06:52] <BooitsDock> @angriestpat she really broken if you know how to use her

[1:11:55] <chaosbuckle> Feel so bad for Pat right now.

[1:12:27] <%Njs10> @AngriestPat you can turn off gifting in the options, you can turn it to anyone, friends only, or no gifts at all
[1:12:27] <TanktopNerd> @GN93 because the movement in the game requires alternating between keys very fast and using mouse aiming to optimize movement

[1:19:19] <Twoiis> Room to learn and grow.
[1:19:19] <OfficialTimothy> You are a MUTANT
[1:19:20] <+SuichiTanaka> Pat likes learning about systems.
[1:19:20] <+deadpalvgz> Ah so warframe is perfect for you
[1:19:20] <+SpookySpaghooti> for a new player thats very good
[1:19:20] <TyrantBelial> @AngriestPat you have 700 plats wjhich is barely anything for trading

[1:19:40] <+Brownsugar579> worthless passive

[1:19:40] <+xXichibanballer> Don't fucking spend your plat until you know what mods you wanna buy
[1:19:41] <%CJett92> TRAMBAMPOLINE

[1:19:48] <%CJett92> BAMBOOMPALINE
[1:19:54] <Ace_Kuper> @Gogogolem You just need to combine with it in a big pile of goo over time. When you will learn.

[1:27:36] <%LGWPhanto> @AngriestPat Her 1 ability makes enemies float and become helpless
[1:27:37] <corn_on_fire> it seems like a stun
[1:27:38] <sunriser696> hypest warframe gameplay on twitch

[1:29:48] <Volkrotia> They are a Bio Weapon that wiped out the Orokin, the people responsible for the Warframes
[1:29:49] <%Ablestron> @AngriestPat it was an orokin bioweapon that was TOO GOOD
[1:29:51] <Nilysila> pat getting big and strong

[1:33:37] <love_plays> @AngriestPat Tbh, you should focus more on maxing out your mods than trying to get as many new ones on at once as you can.
[1:33:38] <TheImmortal70> They're literally buffs
[1:33:40] <zakti_prime> auto install isn't great but It'll get you through shit until you understand

[1:33:56] <%Mr_y1096> LUL

[1:34:05] <%TamsynRRD> Someone = Plague
[1:34:06] <reaperx186> you see that happen because you had energy channel on that stick pat
[1:34:07] <+NiktenKing> @PlagueOfGripes Definitely not Eli
[1:34:09] <+augurgewalt> Mods define most of your stast really
[1:34:10] <+nerdygamer1401> *facepalm*
[1:34:10] <Rogue657> @TheImmortal70 "best ones you got" isn't a defined quantity
[1:34:11] <+Punchasaur> i cant believe youve done this
[1:34:11] <+Ciphris> he can upgrade the mods and then not use them BECAUSE HE CAN'T INSTALL IT
[1:34:11] <+Mr_FruitzNutz> i've seen SFM porn of this
[1:34:15] <aliggg321> I'M ANGRY PAT ISN'T PLAYING HOW I WANT HIM TO PLAY
[1:34:15] <El_Samio> it's a buff piñata Pat
[1:34:15] <MonsieurHedge> Tribute works like Kinsects
[1:34:18] <+OblivionSword1> Haven't seen this Tileset in a long while
[1:34:20] <+deadpalvgz> @PlagueOfGripes please tell him about the wiki
[1:34:23] <+ccwettr123> holy shit just got dead, been farming for it on and off for years now :) :)
[1:34:25] <weinercleaver> Papa Eli
[1:34:27] <El_Samio> kill enemies with 2, grab their "shadow", get a buff depending on enemy type
[1:34:27] <+ccwettr123> *dread
[1:34:28] <%Gogogolem> @AngriestPat I think her second ablity is a decoy
[1:34:29] <+trnzero> His mate is like Capt. America mixed w/ Zed from OG Power Rangers
[1:34:29] <fruit_pie_the_magician> mods modify your stats in the ways written on them
[1:34:29] <tangoragahn> You level mods to increase hp/energy/damage
[1:34:35] <+quarkee> hold shift and hit space alot to look impressive
[1:34:39] <Worldbrand> that gun sounds better than I remember
[1:34:39] <stealthfart> I’m thinking about playing FFXIV. What role was Pat because I want some insight and I might try a more support based character?
[1:34:45] <+ruddyredbone> Its super weird
[1:34:45] <Ace_Kuper> @PlagueOfGripes You now have another "child" to teach in Warframe. Listening to you talk about helping some new guy was super nice.
[1:34:47] <CertainlySyrix> @ccwettr123 man you got screwed out, that's like his most common drop
[1:34:51] <oppai_knight> there's not nearly as much warframe porn as you might expect. kinda disappointing tbh
[1:34:52] <+quarkee> play paladin its the beat
[1:34:53] <reaperx186> how 2 spot low mastery players: Dread
[1:34:55] <El_Samio> Titania's 2 is a buff piñata
[1:34:56] <Crippl3> @Worldbrand they redid most of the gun sounds in a major update last month
[1:34:57] <+Pendlez> @stealthfart white mage is a great beginner healer
[1:35:11] <LORDSPOOKLEKINS> @reaperx186 dread is super good man.
[1:35:13] <gut_punch> BONK
[1:35:14] <+averyoddjew> oh god i haven't played this game in years
[1:35:18] <+deadpalvgz> fas'dfl;afds
[1:35:18] <Tomschiii> @oppai_knight its a shame, Yea
[1:35:20] <Ace_Kuper> @oppai_knight Your name checks out.
[1:35:20] <%sleepy_coffee> wait what
[1:35:22] <+mechokk> @averyoddjew same
[1:35:23] <@PlagueOfGripes> you and everyone pat
[1:35:23] <SunsetJack> @reaperx186 They increase Dread's MR now soo...
[1:35:23] <+gessho> every frame can do finishers
[1:35:23] <TyrantBelial> It's an assassination
[1:35:23] <%a_turnt_egg> Pat needs to finish
[1:35:25] <reaperx186> it is,but like its also go to when tigris prime aint there
[1:35:28] <Worldbrand> @Crippl3 I had no idea it was so many
[1:35:28] <+deadpalvgz> finishers are done against enemies in certain states
[1:35:29] <tangoragahn> Thats a lie
[1:35:29] <reaperx186> oh rip
[1:35:31] <fruit_pie_the_magician> warframe porn is like car porn
[1:35:31] <reaperx186> they did?
[1:35:32] <LORDSPOOKLEKINS> @AngriestPat Finishers are basically stealth attacks
[1:35:32] <+Lucarioismadpt2> Anyone can do finishers. titania cannot proc finishers
[1:35:33] <+deadpalvgz> it has nothing to do with your frame
[1:35:33] <Rogue657> @AngriestPat finishers are a melee attack you can do to stunned/blinded enemies
[1:35:33] <+MarshallLee67> every frame can do finishers it's just hard to do on infested
[1:35:33] <El_Samio> it's not that your frame "can't" do finishers, it's that she has no innate way to trigger them
[1:35:34] <+TootPirate> starBri starBri starBri
[1:35:35] <BigBroski410> I’d try to get Rhino ASAP if you don’t already have him. He’s a fantastic tank frame.
[1:35:35] <+ccwettr123> @CertainlySyrix tell me about it, hell I got war before I got dread
[1:35:36] <+xXichibanballer> I have 6 formas on my Mutualist Cernos
[1:35:36] <reaperx186> whats the MR now?
[1:35:36] <Rentixx> finisher is a sneak or ground attack
[1:35:36] <TyrantBelial> it's a COup De Grace
[1:35:37] <aeonicvector> finishers are an attack on a blind, asleep, unaware enemy, etc.
[1:35:37] <+migofrompluto> Should he buy the regular bo staff for credits?
[1:35:39] <+mechokk> wait whats a finisher?
[1:35:41] <hecadisth> Excal has an ability that opens enemies to finishers, you can also do them when doing stealth
[1:35:42] <%MGKBurrito> @AngriestPat finishers are just specially animated attacks, any frame can do them
[1:35:43] <stealthfart> @pendlez I’ll look into it. Thanks.
[1:35:43] <+deadpalvgz> excal can make enemies vulnerable to them
[1:35:44] <+spookysenpai20xx> @reaperx186 How low we talking here bc Dread is pretty good
[1:35:47] <+mechokk> i thought there were just styles
[1:35:48] <TwentyCXII> Also, what happens if I do a Gift of the Lotus quest while I have no available weapon slots?
[1:35:49] <%spacekataz18> Finishers you knock a dude down and then stab them on the ground
[1:35:50] <Hispanacomida25> people getting mad at Pat over a free 2 play game. yikes
[1:35:51] <%a_turnt_egg> you
[1:35:52] <tangoragahn> Your frame CAN do finishers
[1:35:53] <+mechokk> ahhh
[1:35:55] <Slam_Punk> You slow down
[1:35:56] <%a_turnt_egg> did it
[1:35:58] <+TheShal> Geeze the Dead to Rights LP is going somewhere.
[1:35:58] <reaperx186> single digits
[1:36:00] <oppai_knight> virgin paris prime vs chad dread
[1:36:00] <TheSpartanThief> @AngriestPat basically, when behind an enemy in stealth, of when an enemy is stunned due to an ability, you can reform a pre-set finisher on them for HUGE damage.
[1:36:03] <+OblivionSword1> Finisher = Execution
[1:36:04] <%Gogogolem> You mean murder flies
[1:36:06] <%Lordgale119> @AngriestPat build your oberon already, he's amazing
[1:36:06] <gut_punch> @TwentyCXII It gives you a slot
[1:36:09] <Volkrotia> @AngriestPat Her 1 makes enemies float and also makes u immune to status effects if cast on the ground or at an ally
[1:36:13] <El_Samio> Gift of the Lotus quests rewards come with free slots and potato
[1:36:16] <%TheSniperJoe> Wow...Pat looks...like premium currancy right now. How did we start this at the same time and you look like THAT?
[1:36:16] <CertainlySyrix> chad daikyu vs virgin dread @oppai_knight
[1:36:23] <oppai_knight> shit u right
[1:36:26] <+quarkee> can i replace the normal narrator with that one faction leader computer lady she seems to be a billion times better and also not bipolar
[1:36:28] <Forshino> Any frame can do a knockdown finisher by doing an aerial groundslam then meleeing
[1:36:30] <+mechokk> @TheSniperJoe gifts, lots and lots of gifts
[1:36:32] <Crippl3> imagine using a bow other than the lenz, smdh tbh
[1:36:35] <Tomschiii> I Miss my saryn
[1:36:35] <tangoragahn> Some frames have abilities that set finishers up, but every frame can do them
[1:36:36] <TwentyCXII> @gut_punch Oh reeeeeeeally? That is hype
[1:36:42] <%TheSniperJoe> @mechokk Aaaaah, yeah that makes sense.
[1:36:42] <+AcidicHorizon> Get Brozime to tell pat how to mod
[1:36:49] <gut_punch> Jogo misterioso
[1:36:51] <%Gogogolem> @AngriestPat Pat its a buff
[1:36:53] <BigBroski410> Are we forgetting the Lenz just exists?
[1:36:54] <+ruddyredbone> most complicated frame
[1:36:54] <%Remery_> Very pretty game
[1:36:55] <thelonechris> What a mysterious jogo
[1:36:57] <aeonicvector> Time is convoluted in the orogin system
[1:36:57] <%wsintai> A truly mysterious jogo
[1:37:01] <BourneWarrior> Literal Mysterious Jogo
[1:37:03] <Bailey__gaming> MYSTERIOUS JOGO
[1:37:03] <%sleepy_coffee> it ain't mysterious if you read your abilities D:
[1:37:04] <%Orphen_Griever> a mysterious jogo!!??
[1:37:05] <zakti_prime> buffs are the blue symbols nest to your health and shields
[1:37:05] <Slam_Punk> SNOB
[1:37:06] <Ghostars> Pat, Titania is a complex frame that requires a lot of mod. Go Rhino, big buff bois that make noise
[1:37:06] <+migofrompluto> @quarkee you cannot get rid of Spacemom!
[1:37:09] <Sunstalker> I thought Pat would have made a mace or hammer or staff weapon that at least looked heavier. danWut
[1:37:11] <Rogue657> @AngriestPat the top right shows buffs applied to you
[1:37:11] <+Pendlez> same
[1:37:11] <LORDSPOOKLEKINS> Both
[1:37:11] <%Gogogolem> @AngriestPat Everyone
[1:37:13] <Crippl3> Both
[1:37:13] <aeonicvector> yes
[1:37:13] <+enterprise900> BOTH
[1:37:13] <FrostedZaibatsu> Video game biggot
[1:37:14] <+TootPirate> both
[1:37:15] <reaperx186> both
[1:37:17] <OceanGovernor> everyone gets the big buff
[1:37:17] <Everpresent_Overseer> Both
[1:37:17] <MonocledGhost> bolth
[1:37:20] <Worldbrand> Neither, because it's an enemy debuff
[1:37:20] <+FuhrerVonZephyr> @AngriestPat Isn't a buff to your team also a buff to you?
[1:37:26] <+OblivionSword1> Someone get Brozime in here
[1:37:26] <Worldbrand> Oh wait you're not talking about her 2
[1:37:27] <%CJett92> Its a temporary buff, dont worry about it tho
[1:37:28] <+augurgewalt> since pat is a beginner levelling vitality and the direct damage mods is really the only thing he actually needs to do
[1:37:32] <+xXichibanballer> This is probably one of the best times for anyone to just jump in anyways
[1:37:35] <Bailey__gaming> we need a mysterious jogo emote
[1:37:36] <Peashooter117> A mysterious Duwang.
[1:37:36] <Ace_Kuper> @Fuhrervonzephyr Not necessary

[1:38:14] <Riki_Mau> poor mag
[1:38:15] <$OmegaWeltall> everyone says Mag sucks but i LOVE her design BibleThump
[1:38:15] <+skibbz_> Volt is pretty good tieSonci
[1:38:15] <tangoragahn> Volt's in the dojo
[1:38:15] <SunsetJack> @AngriestPat Your clan has Volt unlocked. You can buy it with credits.
[1:38:16] <+AcidicHorizon> Tho they easy to farm
[1:38:16] <Everpresent_Overseer> Loki used to be starter frame
[1:38:17] <Sillare_X_fail> Mag is super easy to farm later on
[1:38:17] <+Nautilus_Bot> titania so good
[1:38:18] <OceanGovernor> waste of plat save it for slots pat
[1:38:18] <+augurgewalt> but they are easy to farm
[1:38:19] <+mechokk> at that point just play a prime
[1:38:21] <Aleate> I remember when Loki was the starter frame other than Volt FeelsBadMan
[1:38:21] <IncredibleMeh> You can get those from farming just fine, you don't need to buy them
[1:38:22] <sassyquatch963> @AngriestPat don't fucking buy frames
[1:38:22] <%TheSniperJoe> I like Excal big slashy slashy.
[1:38:22] <FrostedZaibatsu> Remember when Mag was great BibleThump
[1:38:22] <+OblivionSword1> Mag is ok
[1:38:23] <%Lordgale119> NEVER BUY FRAMES
[1:38:23] <Shinmaddrox> @AngriestPat You can just got most of the base Warframes int eh dojo
[1:38:24] <+unfoldingchoas> farm them, it easy
[1:38:24] <Solidus_113> @AngriestPat volt is in the Dojo, you can get him easy
[1:38:25] <Crippl3> @AngriestPat don't buy Mag and Volt, they're very easy to get in-game without spending money. Mag is farmable and Bolt you get in the Dojo
[1:38:25] <+mechokk> thats a waste
[1:38:26] <%Lordgale119> NEVER EVER
[1:38:26] <zakti_prime> volt is from your dojo
[1:38:26] <+Pendlez> get atlas, you can make 2 rock friends
[1:38:27] <gunsrlove> @AngriestPat You can get Volt parts researched for free in the Dojo
[1:38:29] <+AcidicHorizon> Buy like Mesa
[1:38:30] <gut_punch> @AngriestPat You can buy cuz they are dumb cheap and have potatoes
[1:38:31] <%President_Miyazaki> Well you can get Volt in the Dojo and Mag is easy to farm.
[1:38:31] <Bailey__gaming> Volt is the one I had big electric attack
[1:38:36] <tangoragahn> You buy Volt in the dojo for credits
[1:38:37] <Jam29josh> Yo Pat why aren't you playing solitaire??
[1:38:39] <Banjoboozle> @AngriestPat Yo Pat, Liam just dunked someone super hard on Twitter
[1:38:42] <Ace_Kuper> @Aleate Wan't he also pretty bad at the time?
[1:38:42] <CertainlySyrix> @TheNeedlesD harrow is an absolute chad. my favorite frame in the entire game
[1:38:43] <%Ele_On_A_Uni> only buy frames that are really hard to get - ivara, nidus, atlas, etc
[1:38:48] <+unfoldingchoas> yeah the dojo has voolt
[1:38:50] <Jaxterpeace> vauban
[1:38:52] <+xXichibanballer> He should just buy Volt Prime if he's gonna use his plat on frames
[1:38:52] <+SlappyMeats> oh yeah, this game exists
[1:38:53] <+augurgewalt> was the sergeant ever a dangerous boss?
[1:38:53] <+mechokk> @Banjoboozle context?
[1:38:54] <+Nautilus_Bot> its both
[1:38:55] <%a_turnt_egg> Potato Potatord
[1:38:55] <+AcidicHorizon> Potato
[1:38:56] <hecadisth> both
[1:38:59] <%Gogogolem> Potatoes
[1:39:00] <Aleate> @Ace_Kuper Pretty bad, yeah. Its why they switched off him
[1:39:00] <mr_slaide> Pat, what do you think of El Grande Padre?
[1:39:01] <+dyedeme> swoogPotato ?
[1:39:03] <%Remery_> Not rea;l Potato :(
[1:39:04] <FrostedZaibatsu> Yeah 100% buy Mesa because her quest suck
[1:39:06] <+NiktenKing> POTATO POTATORD
[1:39:07] <LORDSPOOKLEKINS> @AngriestPat Reactors are for warframes, cata's are for weapons.
[1:39:07] <suikudo> Equonox
[1:39:08] <The_Maddness> @AngriestPat dont buy the starters, theyre very easy to get, as opposed to others that are a pain to get without plat
[1:39:11] <TheNeedlesD> Cool guess I'll try to farm the prints later
[1:39:13] <Rogue657> @xXichibanballer you mean from trading? cause you can only buy primes from prime access, not market
[1:39:13] <gut_punch> There are three kinds of potatoes
[1:39:15] <oppai_knight> be sure to adorn your Rhino with Tarkus colours for maximum poise
[1:39:16] <suikudo> You for sure want to buy equonox
[1:39:16] <MonocledGhost> They each come with a free lalafell
[1:39:20] <%captainthunderwolf> @CertainlySyrix Harrow is a good-ass name. That sounds like a really neat tiefling from someone's D&D campaign.
[1:39:21] <Ace_Kuper> @Aleate I used him as my starter at the time, boy was it bad.
[1:39:22] <cizal11> yeah no woolie is fuckin screwed
[1:39:23] <+NiktenKing> Yeah... but you look cool here though
[1:39:27] <+augurgewalt> equinox farming wasn't that bad
[1:39:28] <thelonechris> Pat's starting to forget about MH
[1:39:28] <TyrantBelial> Oh yeah you have to minmax in warframe
[1:39:28] <%Larshas> What the heck was that music
[1:39:28] <cizal11> because he probably adores the look of it
[1:39:29] <+starlessgobo> @TheNeedlesD Really good frame especially if you know how to do headshots and synergize weapon loadouts with him. Hes basically Offensive support
[1:39:30] <reaperx186> @AngriestPat you can get a better version of volt and mag called prime by grinding,they arent purchasable (outside of the trade market) and have a design upgrade
[1:39:30] <jastrouble97> this is way easier
[1:39:32] <El_Samio> the thing is that here fashion and min/maxing are completely separated
[1:39:33] <@thenefftw> Woolie would be lost at the first menu
[1:39:34] <+OranHexthief> yeah but its more straight forward in this game
[1:39:34] <Ace_Kuper> @AngriestPat Well, min-maxing doesn't affect fashion here.
[1:39:35] <Bncbck> difference is that appearance is separated from min-maxing
[1:39:35] <patismyhero> Feed the drugs more mindless potatoes .
[1:39:37] <Volkrotia> Only Frames i'd buy with Plat are the super cheap ones (since you have plat) and Mesa cause her grind is too insane for any human
[1:39:38] <mr_slaide> Woolie hates fun.
[1:39:38] <MrDrayko> minmaxing is noncosmetic so he'd be fine
[1:39:39] <Crippl3> and we haven't even gotten into syndicates, focus, or the plains yet OpieOP
[1:39:39] <+ccwettr123> thing about this game is that the best stuff looks the coolest, so Woolie would love it
[1:39:39] <prime_name> More Numbers is less time for fashion.
[1:39:40] <TyrantBelial> damage mods REQUIRED?
[1:39:40] <LORDSPOOKLEKINS> Yeah but you always get to look cool in this game
[1:39:40] <Aleate> @AngriestPat But MinMaxing doesn't have to do with cosmetics in this game OpieOP
[1:39:41] <Twoiis> It sounds like he mostly doesn't like it because it affects his appearance.
[1:39:41] <TyrantBelial> he'd quit
[1:39:41] <%Ablestron> @AngriestPat the minmaxing in Warframe is different though its not tied to how you LOOK
[1:39:42] <zakti_prime> endgame is viable with min max
[1:39:43] <tangoragahn> WF lacks fashion affecting stats tho
[1:39:43] <Riki_Mau> the difference between someone minmaxing and not minmaxing in this game is absurd
[1:39:43] <CertainlySyrix> @captainthunderwolf He's the Priest Frame, who can do some support things for teammates and specialized in marksmanship.
[1:39:45] <+Nautilus_Bot> different enemies will give you differemt buffs
[1:39:47] <+NiktenKing> Yeah,but this has cosmetics though Pat... when cosmetics are tied to stats... it sucks
[1:39:47] <%serpenttucker> @AngriestPat He doesn't like the minmaxing because the stats are tied to cosmetics. Not so much in this game.
[1:39:47] <+augurgewalt> Ivara was torture
[1:39:50] <Alfax> By the way Pat, you can turn off constant weapon trails for your melee if you don't like the visual spam. It's somewhere in the graphics menu.
[1:39:52] <sponsoredviewer910> it buffs you
[1:39:52] <%Gogogolem> @AngriestPat Actualy i don't know what the buff does either
[1:39:53] <BigBroski410> Fashionframe is the only TRUE endgame
[1:39:54] <%Shmango65> the min/maxing in this game is required but easy to understand WHEN YOU LEARN HOW TO MOD
[1:39:54] <%CJett92> * Temporary buffs *
[1:39:55] <El_Samio> Titania's 2 gives different buffs depending on enemy type
[1:39:56] <Worldbrand> Consult the wiki, because the game doesnt really tell you what the buff does.
[1:39:57] <+mechokk> wow liam, welcome to petty city thats strong
[1:39:58] <reaperx186> gotta love perfect spy mission ivara
[1:39:59] <Slam_Punk> This is actually pso2 Kappa you just cant see it yet
[1:39:59] <Banjoboozle> @mechokk Some guy was arguing with him about video game trends and basically said that Liam can't think, to which he replied that he can't even back up his statements
[1:40:01] <MonsieurHedge> @AngriestPat Buff is Kinsects
[1:40:03] <Rentixx> By the way you can hold F to go into mele stance mode
[1:40:03] <+AcidicHorizon> @AngriestPat Hey have you farmed relics to get prime part to sell for ducats to buy stuff at Baro?
[1:40:04] <+xXichibanballer> @Rogue657 literally the only place that makes sense to spend your plat is during trades
[1:40:05] <+enterprise900> I mean at least in this game you can fashion while you minmax
[1:40:06] <MonocledGhost> Woolie'd be down with the endgame, since endgame is fashionframe, but getting there is the issue
[1:40:06] <patismyhero> It’s something
[1:40:08] <%a_turnt_egg> Woolzie would like it
[1:40:09] <+gozzojt27> cept thats kinda wrong
[1:40:09] <+Punchasaur> worframe
[1:40:11] <$SGrim> @AngriestPat imagine that your frame is a vampire. Drink to get bigger! SwiftRage
[1:40:12] <ZepToYourStep> unless you play chroma
[1:40:12] <Worldbrand> The buff depends on the enemy it's cast on, and is usually an AoE enemy debuff
[1:40:13] <%captainthunderwolf> @CertainlySyrix So he's a Weapon Damage/Support specialist? That's a neat pairing.
[1:40:14] <Volkrotia> It used to WAAYYY back
[1:40:15] <TheSpartanThief> @AngriestPat He'd HATE Speedva/EV Trin. Using negative stats to give YOU power? The madness of it!
[1:40:15] <+mechokk> @Banjoboozle yeah i just looked that guy didnt bother to even prove his point
[1:40:15] <+Castlefronk> @angriestpat Did you get the saint pattys day color pack yet?
[1:40:16] <+augurgewalt> actually wrong
[1:40:18] <vaan_ratsbane> 2fast2quick
[1:40:18] <Volkrotia> With Arcane helmets
[1:40:19] <TheNeedlesD> You can never be too fast
[1:40:19] <Everpresent_Overseer> except for the Scindo
[1:40:19] <Jodoxk1> What but Fashion is best stat in game Kappa
[1:40:20] <Rogue657> @xXichibanballer ofc, but he's nowhere near the point where he should worry about that
[1:40:21] <The_Maddness> I feel like woolie would like warframe
[1:40:22] <cizal11> that's what the glide is for
[1:40:23] <Banjoboozle> @AngriestPat Tell Woolie to make the Uragaan set, Pat. He'll enjoy it.
[1:40:23] <cizal11> kinda
[1:40:24] <+ccwettr123> lol 'too fast' and no movement mods yet
[1:40:24] <Worldbrand> Turn off melee auto-targetting
[1:40:26] <tierney12> Cough cough legacy arcane helmets
[1:40:31] <Everpresent_Overseer> The scindo skins affect it's stats
[1:40:32] <Twoiis> anniversary
[1:40:32] <Ace_Kuper> @thenefftw I think his sense of direction would get him super lost, i sometimes loose there to go and i played this maps a lot.
[1:40:32] <mostundesired> Just got here, can someone explain Skelmo's bra?
[1:40:32] <+SlappyMeats> Woolie will learn; we'll see how pretty his character looks when she's getting constantly bulldozed
[1:40:34] <El_Samio> anniversary gifts
[1:40:34] <+migofrompluto> Woolie's issue was mostly fashion wasn't it? It wasn't about minmaxing per say?
[1:40:35] <+TeethMuncher> @AngriestPat you'll get used to the speed when you develop ultra instinct
[1:40:37] <SunsetJack> Anniversary?
[1:40:37] <lord_souls> to fast some on get a volt and blow his mind
[1:40:40] <+mechokk> @Banjoboozle if only glacial agnaktor was in worlds hed probably love it
[1:40:41] <%TamsynRRD> I so want to see Woolie bounce off HR kirin with that lance he's married.
[1:40:41] <+nerdygamer1401> they are goof
[1:40:45] <+nerdygamer1401> *goof
[1:40:46] <@thenefftw> I love the anniversary weapons
[1:40:46] <El_Samio> Dex Sybaris is upper tier
[1:40:47] <+nerdygamer1401> *good
[1:40:47] <+ruddyredbone> @mostundesired paige died
[1:40:48] <Crippl3> Yeah, this was a good time to start, all the Dex weapons are great
[1:40:48] <+unfoldingchoas> event weapons
[1:40:50] <OceanGovernor> Warframe is 5 years old
[1:40:51] <%President_Miyazaki> There is a skin for the Fragor that increases Attack Speed I think.
[1:40:51] <+NiktenKing> Oh boy, don't go anywhere near Volt, Pat.
[1:40:52] <+OblivionSword1> Dex stuff are good
[1:40:59] <mostundesired> @ruddyredbone Thank you kindly SeemsGood
[1:40:59] <+TootPirate> The dex sybartis is tyop tier btw @AngriestPat
[1:41:00] <pswayde> @AngriestPat hit up a Warframe content creator by the name of Brozime. He has a deep understanding of the intricacies of the systems and subsystems.
[1:41:03] <+Nautilus_Bot> volt is one of my favorites
[1:41:06] <+nerdygamer1401> use the dex melee
[1:41:08] <+JustbeJake> I just started and the enemies feel like they don’t stand a chance. Does it get harder?
[1:41:09] <cizal11> welp
[1:41:09] <Slam_Punk> If melee auto targeting is off you can do some neo stuff with wall jumps
[1:41:10] <%wsintai> QUICK, TALK ABOUT GROSS PORN
[1:41:11] <+augurgewalt> the actual starting weapons are atrocious, thankfully you can upgrade them quickly
[1:41:13] <Twoiis> Time to bad mouth pat.
[1:41:14] <zakti_prime> dex sybaris is sex sybaris
[1:41:15] <SunsetJack> @NiktenKing Volt got better.

[1:41:32] <+Nautilus_Bot> TITANIA ASS
[1:41:34] <TheNeedlesD> He never turned off gifts did he?
[1:41:35] <El_Samio> NEVER GO FULL MELEE WITHOUT STANCES
[1:41:36] <%commanderclaw> Muatrd
[1:41:36] <Everpresent_Overseer> Have we become ghosts?!
[1:41:37] <%TaterBurglar> Speaking of potatoes, Pat is aiming like one
[1:41:39] <@PlagueOfGripes> channeling LUL
[1:41:40] <%CJett92> Pat is blind, eat mustard til he gets back!
[1:41:41] <CertainlySyrix> FUCK THOSE SHITTY LITTLE SPACE KIDS
[1:41:42] <percibot> @JaketheProtagonist yes! it does get harder, although the way it gets harder is by enemies becoming fucking giant walls of stats. it's a bit of an issue with the game and it'll hopefully be resolved eventually
[1:41:42] <$SGrim> @wsintai how gross? like all the way to missionary for the sole purpose of procreation? Wutface
[1:41:43] <+augurgewalt> Titania has no ass to speak of

[1:42:05] <GyroBrando> yea he didnt turn off gifts because he likes to cheat
[1:42:06] <Rogue657> PogChamp
[1:42:07] <+xXichibanballer> @Rogue657 Tbh, if he is going to spend plat on warframes, the starter ones are pretty reasonable because of how cheap they are.
[1:42:10] <bit_guardian> Using energy to empower melee strikes
[1:42:11] <El_Samio> you also get some new complete bullshit enemy types, such as NULLIFIERS which are the bane of anything good and holy
[1:42:12] <patismyhero> Chat on fire
[1:42:12] <%wsintai> @SGrim I mean full handholding
[1:42:13] <Ace_Kuper> Is channeling even useful, i never bother with it?

[1:42:23] <cizal11> valkyr?
[1:42:25] <%IllusionKiller522> Saryn
[1:42:26] <bit_guardian> Life Strike is wonderful. So channeling is necessary.
[1:42:27] <TheSpartanThief> He did the thing
[1:42:27] <megamonmon123> so plague succeeded in getting pat into new crack

[1:42:36] <cizal11> LMFAO
[1:42:37] <Slam_Punk> N-nice
[1:42:37] <+starlessgobo> MinMaxing is tied to MODs
[1:42:37] <%TaterBurglar> Plague would know the fat asses stats of Warframe for sure
[1:42:38] <TheNeedlesD> yup he forgot
[1:42:39] <tierney12> Saryn @poodo89

[1:55:10] <+augurgewalt> the grind of grindolon
[1:55:11] <oppai_knight> AVOID AVOID AVOID
[1:55:13] <El_Samio> good, DO NOT ENTER CETUS YET
[1:55:13] <%Ele_On_A_Uni> YEAH YOU DID
[1:55:13] <LORDSPOOKLEKINS> @AngriestPat Stay out of there for now.
[1:55:14] <fattness132> dont worry about it, pat - later game stuff
[1:55:15] <+gozzojt27> aww, rip
[1:55:16] <cizal11> that is a good decision
[1:55:18] <@thenefftw> BIG SCARE
[1:55:19] <+Ondartyr> Early game at risk!
[1:55:19] <%Remery_> Big Scare
[1:55:20] <+MarshallLee67> @AngriestPat it is confusing and you don't need it at all right now, just avoid it
[1:55:20] <cizal11> it's technically late game stuff
[1:55:21] <Jodoxk1> To Spooky For Me
[1:55:21] <%Ablestron> @AngriestPat you can do plains early stuff
[1:55:22] <TezarroEX> get messy, get wild, do it Kappa
[1:55:22] <El_Samio> Finish Mercury
[1:55:24] <+TeethMuncher> BRIGHT
[1:55:25] <tangoragahn> Big frighten
[1:55:27] <+unfoldingchoas> no not yet finish all planets first
[1:55:30] <+migofrompluto> Saya's Vigil is for the Gara bp?
[1:55:32] <+augurgewalt> also lags like hell fairly often
[1:55:35] <EDFscout> But it's in the MIDLE OF PROGRESS
[1:55:37] <Rogue657> @AngriestPat Finishing junctions and quests should be your goal for the time being
[1:55:37] <The_Maddness> @AngriestPat dont do Cetus he just wants you to get roped into a the open world shit thats not relevant yet
[1:55:39] <Everpresent_Overseer> Good Pat, your survival instincts have been shown
[1:55:40] <%a_turnt_egg> aww, we love you pat
[1:55:40] <%Remery_> Pat Shook
[1:55:42] <%Ablestron> @AngriestPat dont worry, youre doing fine <3
[1:55:42] <+deadpalvgz> do every single mission on the planet
[1:55:44] <zakti_prime> wait until you finish up to uranus
[1:55:44] <+MetroidHunter26> @AngriestPat I would try to focus on completing the star chart and getting some good mods and warframes before heading down to Cetus.
[1:55:44] <%Gogogolem> @AngriestPat yes
[1:55:46] <Worldbrand> The second one
[1:55:46] <thelonechris> Continue you coward
[1:55:46] <fattness132> do all of them
[1:55:46] <+KSabot> get to the junctions
[1:55:47] <+deadpalvgz> at least once
[1:55:47] <@PlagueOfGripes> did he play more than one mission?
[1:55:48] <%MGKBurrito> all missions
[1:55:49] <SunsetJack> Do enough to move on.
[1:55:49] <+xXichibanballer> Do enough to move on
[1:55:50] <+QuadraticGravity> Just do enough.
[1:55:51] <%Remery_> The Sailor Scount yes
[1:55:51] <+Brownsugar579> all of them
[1:55:51] <cizal11> just enough to move on
[1:55:51] <TheNeedlesD> Latter
[1:55:51] <grayjammer> I went there at like, MR 1 and it was the most terrifying thing ever
[1:55:52] <+deadpalvgz> yes @PlagueOfGripes
[1:55:52] <Twoiis> enough
[1:55:52] <+unfoldingchoas> yup
[1:55:53] <+boredpantz> @AngriestPat All missions
[1:55:53] <LORDSPOOKLEKINS> Do all the nodes
[1:55:53] <bear_breaker20> to move on
[1:55:54] <+augurgewalt> uograde your mods you pat
[1:55:54] <aeonicvector> enough to move on
[1:55:54] <+babyacid> unlock the junction
[1:55:54] <%TaifuDragon> Hit all your requirements for junctions
[1:55:55] <+preppyposs> @AngriestPat unlock all the nodes for it
[1:55:55] <TheSpartanThief> No, just complete the mission reqiored
[1:55:55] <@thenefftw> @PlagueOfGripes No
[1:55:57] <KingSpunf> get through the planets
[1:55:57] <mcevers> Step one should be opening the entire map
[1:55:57] <CertainlySyrix> Do enough to move on @AngriestPat don't need to do all of them
[1:55:57] <+Ultimatefool> @AngriestPat More importantly are junctions
[1:55:57] <tangoragahn> Either
[1:55:57] <+gilgawain> Hey Pat, looking good from the gym! Are you bigger and tougher than Peach now?
[1:55:57] <Rogue657> @AngriestPat Yes, at least enough to get to other planets
[1:55:58] <+OblivionSword1> Just get to the Junctions
[1:55:58] <+AcidicHorizon> A few Plauge
[1:55:58] <Shinmaddrox> Once you get the hang of it quickly stops being intimidating.
[1:55:59] <%TaifuDragon> So basically just do suisoi
[1:55:59] <faegbeard> Do enough to move on, finish them all later.
[1:55:59] <TheSpartanThief> usually a boss
[1:56:00] <tierney12> Warframe is the big scare WutFace
[1:56:01] <+Daigrey> enough to continue
[1:56:01] <+babyacid> mercury junction
[1:56:01] <CertainlySyrix> You don't need to do all of them
[1:56:01] <cizal11> progressing through the star chart is the main goal
[1:56:02] <Worldbrand> He doesn't need the MR from all the nodes
[1:56:02] <+captain_elsewhere> oh wow your face is defo looking a fair bit thinner, havent seen you for a little while
[1:56:03] <+OranHexthief> enough to move on for now
[1:56:03] <+ruddyredbone> This is revenge for woolie's twitter
[1:56:05] <+djinnJuice> oh no, is pat all the way in now
[1:56:06] <Cobaltor_252> they mean work your way to the assassination mission
[1:56:06] <freedyz> HEY PAT
[1:56:07] <aeonicvector> just try to follow the chain the planets around
[1:56:07] <+babyacid> JUNCTIONS
[1:56:08] <%Larshas> @PlagueOfGripes He played exactly two
[1:56:08] <+fireking900> LUL
[1:56:08] <Rentixx> both would be great, more chances to get an alert mission
[1:56:08] <zakti_prime> enough to fulfill the junctions
[1:56:09] <SunsetJack> Well, do enough to have all nodes unlocked.
[1:56:10] <Twoiis> You want to be able to bounce from planet to planet.
[1:56:11] <hecadisth> Do enough for the junctions
[1:56:13] <+MarshallLee67> @AngriestPat competing mission nodes once grants you mastery rank points so you want to do every mission eventually
[1:56:14] <+xXichibanballer> The only reason to do every single mission of the planet is to use your titan extractors
[1:56:15] <+KSabot> JUNCTIONS MOST IMPORTANT
[1:56:16] <+migofrompluto> You want to unlock all the areas on every planet at some point
[1:56:17] <+Castlefronk> @angriestpat If you don't have it yet, get the st.patricks day color pack in the market.
[1:56:18] <MrDrayko> @AngriestPat Finish the objectives of the junctions to get more planets
[1:56:21] <El_Samio> clearinig missions gives you MR points
[1:56:21] <TezarroEX> this is revenge for the mon hun videos
[1:56:21] <TyrantBelial> Yes
[1:56:22] <+NiktenKing> Enough to progress so you aren't limited to resources
[1:56:24] <cizal11> you can always go back to those missions after you've opened up every planet
[1:56:24] <Crippl3> @AngriestPat Your main progression is just doing enough to cokmplete the junctions, doing every mission on a planet unlocks special Nightmare missions on that planet that you shouldn't worry about until later
[1:56:28] <TyrantBelial> do every single mission
[1:56:28] <HypeArbalest> @AngriestPat If you all of them you can get free stuff from daily farms
[1:56:28] <+mechokk> does anyone know how to fix failed to install segment?
[1:56:28] <%Remery_> Deep Breathes
[1:56:30] <GodlyLuigi> @AngriestPat ya might awnna discord talk with plague for all this shit
[1:56:31] <+augurgewalt> finishing only matters for collectors
[1:56:32] <+Dasbubba> Completet eh junctions mainly so you get more areas yu can farm materials from.
[1:56:33] <TyrantBelial> it gives mastery rank
[1:56:35] <+unfoldingchoas> pat just beat all planet levels to unlock planets
[1:56:45] <+gilgawain> Hey Pat, looking good from the gym! Are you bigger and tougher than Peach now?
[1:56:46] <+fireking900> Junctions cause some planets have some late game
[1:56:46] <%Remery_> The left buttcheek
[1:56:47] <The_Maddness> @AngriestPat I think people mean do enough to the junctions, but you should do all of the nodes on a planet, EVENTUALLY
[1:56:49] <+leontalon> Tattoo your face with david cages face
[1:56:50] <TheHolyCarrot> Hey pat
[1:56:56] <%Ablestron> @AngriestPat you want to finish each system eventually. But for now you need to progress to new systems. So look at what the requirements are for the junktion and do those requirements
[1:56:56] <+tianathol> I like Detroit
[1:56:57] <+neojadan> Next to the butthole?
[1:56:59] <+trnzero> or his balls based on how much they get exposed
[1:57:00] <+captain_elsewhere> chin tat elaKek
[1:57:01] <+Squibo> Pat just needs to focus on filling out the map, doing each mission once
[1:57:01] <+neojadan> Butthole adjacent?
[1:57:03] <fruit_pie_the_magician> you want junctions
[1:57:05] <zakti_prime> pat don't be stressed, warframe is fun
[1:57:08] <+Punchasaur> do you tho
[1:57:15] <TheHolyCarrot> Are you exited for St patricks day? :D @AngriestPat
[1:57:21] <LORDSPOOKLEKINS> LUL
[1:57:22] <MajesticSundew> You don't need to unlock every single node, you can come back as you need them, but you should try to unlock every planet
[1:57:22] <morcego_cinzento> Do a big tribal tattoo 'ZE EMOTION'
[1:57:24] <+ruddyredbone> ??
[1:57:25] <@thenefftw> WAOW
[1:57:25] <cizal11> what
[1:57:27] <TyrantBelial> Pat don't have fun Warframe is stressful
[1:57:29] <+TeethMuncher> @AngriestPat no Monster Hunter the fighting character
[1:57:31] <+leontalon> Thanks Monster Hunter
[1:57:32] <Endlesslyforgetful> NICE
[1:57:32] <%Remery_> Naisu
[1:57:33] <+migofrompluto> You unlock all parts of the star map so you can do all the alerts without having to have someone taxi you there.
[1:57:33] <%peregrin_iii> apatWhat
[1:57:34] <TezarroEX> ok sure
[1:57:34] <thelonechris> The game series itself
[1:57:36] <+mechokk> hold on what
[1:57:37] <CertainlySyrix> the official monster hunter stream subbed to pat
[1:57:39] <%sleepy_coffee> apatCaw
[1:57:42] <%Jp3g95> apatBig apatBig apatBig
[1:57:43] <Rhonne> Pat Palico skin when?
[1:57:44] <+augurgewalt> gifting subs to corporations KappaHD
[1:57:46] <%TaifuDragon> @AngriestPat There's three requirements with planets: Unlocking nodes that junctions require, reaching the assassination mission that is usually at the end of the row, and using your Extractors to get resources from planets (The symbol in the bottom right corner that shows you materials) which requires you to have every node complete
[1:57:52] <%Remery_> MHW Sellout stream when?
[1:57:54] <%Ablestron> @AngriestPat doing every mission on a system unlocks nightmare missions on that system that give special rewards (special mods, etc)
[1:57:57] <+SlappyMeats> oh shit, Kushala's back?
[1:57:59] <+gilgawain> Hey Pat, looking good from the gym! Are you bigger and tougher than Peach now?
[1:58:00] <oppai_knight> pat probably knows more about monhun than the official monhun account
[1:58:13] <$SGrim> @SlappyMeats yes, and he looks glorious Kreygasm
[1:58:14] <@thenefftw> But sellout more tho
[1:58:23] <TezarroEX> He sells out every podcast

[1:58:28] <Hotmemes420> @AngriestPat Are you going to stream Kiwami 2 when it's out?
[1:58:30] <Varanoo> But sellout more though
[1:58:32] <+SlappyMeats> aw yeah
[1:58:32] <+augurgewalt> Senran Kagura beat monster hunter for viewers yesterday
[1:58:34] <@thenefftw> I can't wait for Plague to yell at Pat

[1:58:43] <hecadisth> Play with subs in squad + plague next time

[2:08:55] <Everpresent_Overseer> Welcome to Warframe
[2:08:57] <Varanoo> LOL
[2:09:00] <Noponiz> this is absolutely precious
[2:09:01] <CertainlySyrix> @RonDewing It's possible to raise the FoV
[2:09:03] <Rogue657> @RonDewing You can up the FOV much higher than this
[2:09:04] <+Phobaws06> YOu. DID IT
[2:09:12] <%IllusionKiller522> this is hilarious
[2:09:13] <+Ranayar> how much money has he spent on this game already?
[2:09:14] <samoorai> The true Warframe experiance
[2:09:15] <tierney12> First try PogChamp
[2:09:18] <Rhonne> find that guy with the music again, i wanna hear his sick jams
[2:09:22] <SunsetJack> Only you tho..
[2:09:23] <+QuadraticGravity> Watching Pat is like watching a moth stuck inside a lamp
[2:09:29] <+augurgewalt> Miku Octavia is very pretty, isn't she?
[2:09:30] <BeatH7> shitty has timed buffs!
[2:09:34] <+Phobaws06> Dig up
[2:09:39] <+RonDewing> oh really, that would be helpful
[2:09:48] <Rogue657> @RonDewing Yeah it's a big help
[2:09:50] <SunsetJack> There is a vent you were suppose to go to.
[2:09:50] <+xXichibanballer> `That miku-tavia is lovely
[2:09:52] <El_Samio> pat starts warframe, doesn't even know how to bullet jump good, "hey let's gift him titania"
[2:09:54] <CertainlySyrix> @QuadraticGravity even more accurate because he's playing as titania
[2:09:55] <zakti_prime> pat turn off bloom and motion blur to decrease visual ....mess
[2:09:59] <+QuadraticGravity> Tru
[2:09:59] <twto585> has he turned small yet
[2:10:00] <Belutima> Yes jump more
[2:10:00] <Zanpa> how the hell do you do all this movement
[2:10:18] <zakti_prime> also turn off "weapon energy stream"
[2:10:18] <+SpookySpaghooti> @Zanpa he's bullet jumping, which is crouch+jump
[2:10:19] <+Cobra743> I wanna back seat so bad...my favorite group of youtubers touching my favorite game gets my dick SO HARD.
[2:10:20] <%Jp3g95> You know... they're gonna have a video of this game... and its gonna be the same thing as the monster hunter videos, i reckon
[2:10:20] <+other_badger> most of this movement is just crouchjumping repeatedly, essentially
[2:10:23] <PulverKong> god the character is so close
[2:10:23] <GodlyLuigi> jump wouch sliding
[2:10:26] <tierney12> Has anyone explained MR to Pat yet? LUL
[2:10:29] <+Ultimatefool> @AngriestPat You mayyyy want to turn on UI scaling since you're on 4k
[2:10:31] <Zanpa> SpookySpaghooti and you can do that in any direction?
[2:10:32] <Ace_Kuper> @AngriestPat Woolie would have more problems with his sense of direction on this maps than he would with min-maxing.
[2:10:39] <Rogue657> @Zanpa the twisty shit is crouch+jump, he's using a second jump after that. yes in any direction
[2:10:39] <Rhonne> yeah
[2:10:44] <WaitHowDidIGetHere> S-M-R-T!
[2:10:47] <cizal11> 11 PERCENT
[2:10:49] <Storm_Samurai> @Ace_Kuper Woolie would vomit violently from the camera
[2:10:50] <cizal11> BIG CARRIED
[2:10:52] <%MisterCrimson> you...did it
[2:10:52] <PulverKong> i have no idea what he even did
[2:10:52] <Zanpa> SpookySpaghooti and how does he float? it's just aiming while airborne?
[2:10:53] <MidKnight_24> Pat is in a clan right? Does his clan have the obstacle course?
[2:10:56] <Rogue657> @AngriestPat Look at the tutorials in the codex when you can
[2:10:57] <Rhonne> so what's octavia?
[2:10:59] <+augurgewalt> I'm often unsure how Woolie manages to not get lost in real life
[2:11:00] <+QuadraticGravity> @Zanpa Yes
[2:11:00] <%CJett92> Pat is the big man
[2:11:01] <El_Samio> it was all Pat, he's a big boi
[2:11:01] <Solidus_113> Did you max out your FOV? the character seems a little close
[2:11:04] <oppai_knight> Snailframe with Darlington
[2:11:07] <+unfoldingchoas> vitality mod nice
[2:11:07] <%commanderclaw> @AngriestPat Damn you Pat, you're making me jones for this again

[2:11:16] <Zanpa> Rogue657 SpookySpaghooti QuadraticGravity thanks guys
[2:11:16] <+Ciphris> octavia plays sick jams and buffs the party
[2:11:16] <+other_badger> octavia is a frame that has music based abilities and a small music mixer thing
[2:11:19] <CertainlySyrix> @AngriestPat raise the fov, stream's making some people motion sick
[2:11:22] <Rhonne> if you say so
[2:11:23] <+captain_elsewhere> octavia is a music warframe Rhonne
[2:11:25] <+trnzero> @MidKnight_24 yes, he ran it earlier in the stream
[2:11:27] <+xXichibanballer> Octavia is a music lady who everyone abuses for min-maxing
[2:11:31] <chocolatez3r0> @AngriestPat look at excals codex entry
[2:11:33] <+other_badger> man I fucking WISH ictavia could use arbitrary midis
[2:11:38] <PulverKong> why you boosting all the time i can hardly see what is going on
[2:11:40] <+detbasil> @AngriestPat would it be alright to ask you to zoom out? It's pretty rough.
[2:11:42] <+deadpalvgz> it caps at 78
[2:11:43] <+MarshallLee67> i put actual music on my octavia
[2:11:44] <oppai_knight> octavia has that sick as frick revolver secondary
[2:11:45] <+ruddyredbone> turn off bloom
[2:11:46] <+QuadraticGravity> @AngriestPat Motion Blur off helps a lot to see what's going on.
[2:11:46] <MidKnight_24> Oh okay, I missed it, thanks for answering
[2:11:48] <%Remery_> So it's me or you?
[2:11:50] <TheNeedlesD> That's a risk we're willing to take
[2:11:52] <+deadpalvgz> Muuuuch better
[2:11:54] <+Castlefronk> @angriestpat Check the market for the st.patricks day color pack
[2:11:58] <zakti_prime> @angriestpat turn down bloom, motion blur, and weapon energy stream
[2:12:00] <keiji_maede> how is shitbag pat enjoying warframe? Are you enjoying to becoming "one of us"
[2:12:04] <CertainlySyrix> He's already got it @Castlefronk
[2:12:05] <+augurgewalt> 78 is not that high
[2:12:11] <PulverKong> i really don't get the movement here.
[2:12:15] <Cobaltor_252> yo Pat motion blur actually makes it harder to see when moving fast
[2:12:16] <Rhonne> octavia sounds awesome
[2:12:23] <TezarroEX> live barfs on stream are fun
[2:12:27] <Ghostars> @AngriestPat You should color your DEX Dakra Red in all slots. Don't lose your way. :>
[2:12:28] <+Castlefronk> @certainlysyrix Thanks. just didnt want him to miss it
[2:12:32] <Mr_Deering> surprised your not running a rhino warframe
[2:12:36] <hecadisth> It'll be noticeable in missions
[2:12:38] <CertainlySyrix> Turning off motion blur helps as well
[2:12:42] <%DraxTD> Hay @AngriestPat how's warframe going?
[2:12:47] <+augurgewalt> Octavia's quest is mid-late game and her parts are kinda annoying to farm sadly
[2:12:47] <+Punchasaur> somebody should put the king of the hill theme on their octavia
[2:12:47] <+deadpalvgz> oh
[2:12:48] <MrNoobMcSalt> oh yeah bloom needs to go
[2:12:51] <+deadpalvgz> that looks so much better
[2:12:54] <+other_badger> STFU ORDIS
[2:12:56] <OfficialTimothy> Also kill ordis
[2:12:59] <Rogue657> @AngriestPat Check the tutorials in the codex when you get a chance
[2:13:01] <El_Samio> Ordis loves you
[2:13:02] <+QuadraticGravity> micWh
[2:13:04] <Alfax> Oh disable constant weapon trails. It can get annoying really. They'll still pop up when you go Melee Mode and channel energy
[2:13:04] <PulverKong> GOD the char is so close
[2:13:05] <Isord> HOW DansGame
[2:13:06] <PulverKong> can't see shit
[2:13:06] <El_Samio> leave Ordis alone
[2:13:08] <PatchySouls> motion blur in this game is good
[2:13:08] <GN93> yeah i feel naseous from the spiinning
[2:13:11] <+quarkee> god ordis stop talking
[2:13:12] <TezarroEX> weirdo
[2:13:14] <%wsintai> Wait, someone LIKES motion blur? NANI
[2:13:15] <zakti_prime> @angriestpat angrturn of weapon energy trail
[2:13:16] <+QuadraticGravity> micWh "I like motion blur"
[2:13:16] <TheImmortal70> he fuck is wrong with you
[2:13:19] <+LotS__> Gonna need you to turn up the lens flare
[2:13:20] <SinisterDragon91> Perma-ban the people getting motion sick. They're not hardcore enough for this pro stream.
[2:13:22] <+detbasil> Nani the fuck?
[2:13:22] <Everpresent_Overseer> Ortis will eventually become your handler from monster hunter~
[2:13:24] <Solidus_113> @AngriestPat turning off motion blur also disables some effects on frame abilities
[2:13:28] <LoganPerseveres> Way to be motion blur is cool.
[2:13:28] <%Remery_> I never heard someone say that before
[2:13:28] <%CJett92> YE Suck it nerds!
[2:13:31] <WeirdGuyJ> learn to sprint
[2:13:31] <TranquilTurnip> @AngriestPat its uncanny, every single time I tune in to watch you, you're doing menus. I've never actually seen you play
[2:13:32] <%Larshas> Why don't you leave blur off for a mission and see how it feels?
[2:13:33] <cizal11> so you'd rather it look cool than making it easier on you to play
[2:13:35] <%wsintai> I have never seen Motion Blur look good in anything
[2:13:36] <+xXichibanballer> Sumima sorry
[2:13:37] <hecadisth> Motion blur is cool in this game
[2:13:41] <%captainthunderwolf> @AngriestPat Dude, I'm with you as the 5% of the population who likes motion blur.
[2:13:41] <+ruddyredbone> how about turning off glare
[2:13:44] <oppai_knight> M Y S E N S O R S A R E B L L L E E E E E D I N G
[2:13:45] <GoldeNOVA> It's ok to be wrong, Pat
[2:13:45] <grayjammer> Ordis: "Gellarde!"
[2:13:46] <+JavaManJoJo> You could get 30% more effective DPS by turning off motioin blur
[2:13:48] <BearSawed> Turn off color correction so that lokis invis doesn't kill your eyes
[2:13:49] <Storm_Samurai> Why does this robot have robot butterflies
[2:13:52] <The_Maddness> @AngriestPat Hey pat, Im pretty sure one of the AI npcs in this game is voice by AM
[2:13:54] <Ace_Kuper> @TranquilTurnip It's fine he only did 2 missions.
[2:13:57] <+fireking900> Ur like woolie bit with setting
[2:13:59] <El_Samio> those are robot butterflies

[2:14:23] <+OblivionSword1> My sensors are B L E E D I N G pleased
[2:14:24] <+Ciphris> color correction makes everything look worse
[2:14:28] <+NiktenKing> I think the only game that I liked with motion blur was FF-T0... and that game was a shitshow
[2:14:32] <%CJett92> turn off v-sync
[2:14:33] <%djinnJuice> so many busted ass mods

[2:14:56] <percibot> pat doesn't really have good mods worth upgrading rn, so he's better off not
[2:14:56] <LORDSPOOKLEKINS> THAT IS THE BIGGEST LIE
[2:14:57] <+QuadraticGravity> @AngriestPat Don't upgrade damaged mods, those are baby low-rank tutorial mods. Shitty versions of actual ones.
[2:15:00] <El_Samio> Ayatans are rare statues that give you mod-upgrade juice. Or decoration.
[2:15:01] <+JavaManJoJo> @AngriestPat Auto equip is hot trash
[2:15:01] <KTDelgado> yea he has space aids
[2:15:01] <%djinnJuice> autoequip is real trash
[2:15:02] <%Jp3g95> BIG LIES
[2:15:05] <%Jp3g95> apatWrong
[2:15:07] <+captain_elsewhere> its a small statue you can sell for mod upgrade currency Storm_Samurai
[2:15:08] <TezarroEX> DON'T TRUST WHAT THE GAME TELLS YOU
[2:15:10] <+Misterwolfjtv> Huge Lies
[2:15:12] <Varanoo> LIES
[2:15:15] <%captainthunderwolf> It's very cool that these tutorials use your Warframe as the example.
[2:15:16] <+Brownsugar579> wow that guide sucks
[2:15:19] <oppai_knight> wait does pat have space aids already
[2:15:19] <tangoragahn> It's a stupid term, but Fusing upgrades mods
[2:15:20] <%Jp3g95> big lies for big boys
[2:15:22] <+xXichibanballer> @Storm_Samurai They're treasures you trade for endo. Or you decorate your ship

[2:15:44] <faegbeard> [DAMAGED]
[2:15:44] <+augurgewalt> vitality and the damage ones for the weapon types first
[2:15:44] <+SpookySpaghooti> @AngriestPat Streamline, Intensify, Flow and COntinuity are some of the better mods you can put on a Warframe

[2:16:04] <Shinmaddrox> Never upgrade Damaged
[2:16:04] <Rogue657> @AngriestPat the tutorial doesn't tell you about "Damaged" mods, don't bother upgrading those. your Streamline mod isn't damaged and is very good
[2:16:04] <oppai_knight> @AngriestPat BUY THE OBERON PRINT
[2:16:05] <TezarroEX> DOES HE NOT SEE ITS CRACKED
[2:16:05] <+ruddyredbone> its fine guys
[2:16:06] <@PlagueOfGripes> damaged mods are worse versions of mods
[2:16:07] <+captain_elsewhere> to be fair endo is not a limited resource
[2:16:09] <Cactuskris> Pat please tell me does Dead to Rights continue on the same entertainment level, it could be int he top 10 you guys ever did
[2:16:10] <+Confused_4K> DONT ITS DAMAGED
[2:16:11] <MrNoobMcSalt> That mods is damaged, it won't be nearly as effective as the others
[2:16:11] <MajesticSundew> @AngriestPat Damaged mods are the starter version of real mods, they're way shittier and you can get the real version later on
[2:16:15] <+unfoldingchoas> upgrade vitality not damaged mod
[2:16:15] <+SpookySpaghooti> @AngriestPat Upgrade the Cracked ones you have now!
[2:16:16] <LORDSPOOKLEKINS> @AngriestPat Do not up upgrade broken mods.They are a waste.
[2:16:16] <+quarkee> @everyone he cant see chat
[2:16:17] <BeatH7> lol
[2:16:19] <Mittensbro> @AngriestPat MODS THAT HAVE CRACKS ON THEM ARE DAMAGED
[2:16:19] <+QuadraticGravity> @AngriestPat Damaged mods are shitty versions of actual mods they give you for tutorial
[2:16:20] <+Confused_4K> YOU WANT THE FULL ONE
[2:16:21] <+OranHexthief> if you go to your items upgrades and then hit mods in the bottom right @AngriestPat
[2:16:28] <BearSawed> @MajesticSundew Actually they are higher rank for less mod points, so in some situations they are more efficient
[2:16:31] <Aleate> Streamline would be better tbh
[2:16:31] <percibot> LUL
[2:16:32] <@PlagueOfGripes> you got them from the tutorial missions
[2:16:32] <+Ciphris> DAMAGED MODS ARE FINE UNTIL HE GETS THE REAL ONES
[2:16:35] <+Confused_4K> YOU GET IT IN THE VOID
[2:16:37] <GodlyLuigi> upgrade STREAMLINE
[2:16:38] <arfsm95> @AngriestPat do you know that the corruption on warframe is LITTERALLY a bio curse?
[2:16:41] <%Ablestron> @AngriestPat since you are early in the game a lot of the mods you get as drops are "damaged" variants
[2:16:41] <tangoragahn> Damaged are gimped newbie versions
[2:16:42] <TezarroEX> holy shit NotLikeThis
[2:16:42] <+Phobaws06> see the damaged steamline and normal streamline?
[2:16:46] <Ghostars> Upgrade Streamline, best newbie mod in game
[2:16:47] <+TheShal> SwiftRage
[2:16:47] <+unfoldingchoas> streamlines good to upgrade
[2:16:49] <magoaxki> you have a non damaged streamline
[2:16:51] <+Confused_4K> Damaged mode
[2:16:53] <keiji_maede> lol
[2:16:54] <+Brownsugar579> ypgrade fury
[2:16:55] <%djinnJuice> it costs almost nothing to upgrade damaged mods so eh
[2:16:57] <+xXichibanballer> DAMAGED
[2:17:00] <%captainthunderwolf> Why even include busted mods as a system? To give a baby version until you get the real thing?
[2:17:01] <+ruddyredbone> Its super easy to get the upgrade materials dont go crazy about it
[2:17:01] <%Ablestron> @AngriestPat you should DEFINITELY upgrade your health mod for your frame
[2:17:02] <CertainlySyrix> do that pat
[2:17:02] <Solidus_113> you should have enough to buy oberon now
[2:17:03] <%MisterCrimson> Buy Oberon
[2:17:03] <MidKnight_24> It's for when you need the stat buffs but don't have the capacity to fit in the better version
[2:17:04] <@thenefftw> Good idea
[2:17:05] <Ace_Kuper> @AngriestPat Smart
[2:17:08] <hecadisth> You have enough credits for oberon blueprint dude
[2:17:08] <+QuadraticGravity> @captainthunderwolf Exactly.
[2:17:09] <+Phobaws06> ok
[2:17:09] <%Arnschen> Yes
[2:17:12] <MajesticSundew> WELCOME TO WARFRAME
[2:17:13] <Aleate> Run Pat run! Run away from the mods!
[2:17:13] <Varanoo> YES
[2:17:14] <+augurgewalt> ok
[2:17:17] <grayjammer> Good idea mang
[2:17:18] <+other_badger> ok
[2:17:18] <Zombrocom> That's a good idea
[2:17:19] <%Shmango65> @AngriestPat GO TO THE WIKI
[2:17:20] <CertainlySyrix> That is a good idea.
[2:17:21] <BearSawed> HAHAHAHA That spreadsheet doesn
[2:17:23] <+unfoldingchoas> good idea just keep planet grinding
[2:17:24] <El_Samio> buy Obern and buy Furax / Ankyros
[2:17:24] <arfsm95> @AngriestPat pat i can give you some mods, do you want it?
[2:17:25] <%Remery_> It's ok to feel confused, confused is good. :)
[2:17:27] <+Confused_4K> Wait did he buy Titania?
[2:17:28] <percibot> pat still can't BUILD oberon, so buying the oberon BP seems like a bad idea - he could spend those credits on other decent things in the meantime
[2:17:33] <CertainlySyrix> gift @ConfusedFall
[2:17:34] <El_Samio> DO NOT GIVE HIM MODS
[2:17:34] <%captainthunderwolf> @QuadraticGravity In that case, that's actually a really good system.
[2:17:36] <percibot> and get more money for oberon BP later
[2:17:36] <zakti_prime> @angriestpat turn of constant weapon trail?
[2:17:37] <Cobra743> y u no acknowledge my cheer?
[2:17:40] <+Confused_4K> Ahh

[2:17:59] <BigBroski410> Has Pat ran into the Stalker yet?
[2:18:02] <Storm_Samurai> @Cobra743 patience his mind can only handle so much right now
[2:18:03] <Ace_Kuper> @Cobra743 He reads donation's during breaks
[2:18:06] <%captainthunderwolf> @MidKnight_24 By the way, props for accidentally answering my question literally a second after I asked it.
[2:18:06] <+augurgewalt> Then you try to grind prime parts and get forma instead
[2:18:08] <%Jp3g95> Did she just say you found CRACK?
[2:18:10] <+unfoldingchoas> @hexmastermike yes the bitches
[2:18:12] <Dairaipie> gg

[2:18:41] <Zombrocom> I see pat has learning bullet jumping
[2:18:43] <@thenefftw> I need to get Octavia as soon as possible
[2:18:44] <+xXichibanballer> What song is this?
[2:18:45] <Rhonne> octavia is my favorite now
[2:18:48] <+detbasil> Space Ninjas that are kind of related to the game Dark Sector. What could go wrong?
[2:18:55] <PulverKong> I AM SO CONFUSED
[2:18:55] <%Filthy_Acts> To be fair, sandstorm is an easy song to get buffs from.
[2:18:57] <oppai_knight> a lot of this game's aesthetic reminds me of Blame!
[2:19:05] <TezarroEX> Blame?
[2:19:07] <+JavaManJoJo> lol using an elevator
[2:19:08] <Zanpa> that guy with the music can just play whatever he wants?
[2:19:09] <sunriser696> octavia is like a made for woolie frame
[2:19:11] <oppai_knight> the manga
[2:19:11] <PulverKong> and pat keeps running into walls
[2:19:12] <Aleate> LUL
[2:19:15] <GodlyLuigi> @detbasil what do you mean kind of, it was literally early warframe
[2:19:18] <Zombrocom> You make your own song
[2:19:22] <Cobra743> no pat your not cool
[2:19:29] <+QuadraticGravity> @Zanpa The Octavia Warframe gets a little midi board you can customize.
[2:19:30] <+quarkee> im still using the free amazon stuff bur i can FEEL it getting old fast
[2:19:33] <%Remery_> Cute girls are watching
[2:19:33] <Everpresent_Overseer> @AngriestPat Have you done the "advanced Movement" in training?
[2:19:38] <+Hamblasto> I don't even know what's happening. I just see flippy shit
[2:19:39] <Zanpa> QuadraticGravity that's so fucking cool
[2:19:39] <+Confused_4K> Octavia is dope, love that new deluxe skin
[2:19:40] <BeatH7> nothing cooler than saying "I was being cool"
[2:19:43] <+xXichibanballer> Pat needs volt for #SPEEDFRAME
[2:19:44] <+unfoldingchoas> lol that slow speed to
[2:19:47] <oppai_knight> octavia's a walking hunting horn
[2:19:48] <PulverKong> but what's the point of moving fast when you can't kill anything
[2:19:50] <+gozzojt27> honk
[2:19:51] <xanerts> is this destiny in cool?
[2:19:51] <BigManLugan> How into the game has pat gotten
[2:19:57] <%djinnJuice> pat got loooost
[2:20:02] <arfsm95> @AngriestPat pat i can give you some mods, do you want it?
[2:20:03] <TezarroEX> there we go
[2:20:07] <Solidus_113> you should have enough to buy oberon now @AngriestPat
[2:20:07] <+Confused_4K> It’s destiny in confusing cool
[2:20:09] <TezarroEX> a nice health mod
[2:20:11] <+detbasil> @GodlyLuigi I thought Dark Sector was the inspiration. I didn't realize Tenno in the game was the original Tenno
[2:20:14] <+SpookySpaghooti> @xanerts this is Destiny if Destiny's raids were shit and the regular game was great
[2:20:14] <PulverKong> @BigManLugan pretty much zero
[2:20:15] <Mr_Deering> will you do a one off for this with woolie in an attempt to get him into it?
[2:20:21] <+augurgewalt> You could go faster if you didnt get stuck so much, but i still get stuck after 500 hours so its whatever
[2:20:22] <%CJett92> you.......... did it
[2:20:28] <MajesticSundew> @AngriestPat The waypoints got super fucked up by a recent patch so you might see some bugs sometimes
[2:20:33] <Twoiis> running with people higher level might affect your experience but that would happen naturally on occasion anyway.
[2:20:38] <OceanGovernor> This game is woolie kryptonite
[2:20:38] <+gozzojt27> you...arent wrong...
[2:20:38] <+ruddyredbone> it is
[2:20:40] <+SpookySpaghooti> @AngriestPat are you gonna play Warframe for the channel? Or just for streams
[2:20:41] <TezarroEX> you should get that vitality mod and do stuff with it
[2:20:42] <oppai_knight> a nice wholesome health mod
[2:20:43] <Cobaltor_252> @AngriestPat for the sake of learning I suggest playing missions solo or with predetermined groups
[2:20:45] <cizal11> melee damage is good you should upgrade yours
[2:20:46] <+unfoldingchoas> @pulverkong at the end when you have everything, you tend to wont to speed run through stufc
[2:20:46] <GodlyLuigi> @detbasil the name "Tenno" has a subtle explanation during a later story mission
[2:20:47] <Zombrocom> Those ARE Good
[2:20:52] <El_Samio> vitality and pressure point are SOLID
[2:20:53] <+Confused_4K> What was pats starter? Excel?
[2:21:00] <oppai_knight> ye

[2:21:52] <The_Maddness> Its great you bought that but you dont have the neuroptics blueprint anyway
[2:21:53] <hecadisth> Cells drop in saturn, gallium drops in mars
[2:21:56] <+Doctor_Scoots> Bosses drop cells. Gallium is on mars
[2:21:58] <+QuadraticGravity> @AngriestPat You also need another 60k credits

[2:22:15] <%CJett92> This thing needs a wishlist like MH
[2:22:16] <Cobra743> @PlagueOfGripes are you gouging your eyes out like i am that i cant scream at him what he's doing wrong at every second?

[2:22:56] <LORDSPOOKLEKINS> @AngriestPat You don't get to the story for a fucking WHILE
[2:22:56] <+augurgewalt> After grinding Ivara you literally cannot fail Spy anymore
[2:22:57] <El_Samio> LUL

[2:23:01] <Ace_Kuper> @PlagueOfGripes Wait, you don't appreciate Warframes great story. How could you? Kappa
[2:23:01] <+other_badger> @PlagueOfGripes don't you dare spoil anything youm fuck-o
[2:23:02] <Mr_Deering> it super doesn't
[2:23:02] <Alfax> Yeah that and War Within. Fucking FLEE from spoilers.
[2:23:02] <OfficialTimothy> You are right. Thank you Pat.
[2:23:04] <Monstrosity09> has very little to do with the map
[2:23:06] <+QuadraticGravity> @AngriestPat You're making the right choice.

[2:23:20] <%Ablestron> enjoy not tripping them lazers ;D
[2:23:21] <@PlagueOfGripes> you can't really spoil the quests in this game since they aren't tied to missions on the star chart
[2:23:22] <%Shmango65> ANYONE WHO SPOILS SECOND DREAM NEEDS TO BE AIRLOCKED
[2:23:24] <tangoragahn> The Dickbutt Within
[2:23:24] <oppai_knight> SARYN FOR THE BIG BOOTY
[2:23:25] <TezarroEX> the missions you can get taxied to will not say anything about the story
[2:23:25] <%djinnJuice> the plot is in the back quarter of this game
[2:23:26] <faegbeard> small sneaks for small boy
[2:23:27] <Zombrocom> Ok, warframe is wierd. Only 2% of the game has story, but that story is nuts
[2:23:27] <Lysdexic9541> Pat Bondvin
[2:23:29] <The_Maddness> @AngriestPat you wont see any youre doing quests
[2:23:30] <BaronVonWolfe> This is gonna be great

[2:23:44] <El_Samio> Pat, you are now playing metal gear solid as a spaceninja
[2:23:44] <Xanax44> Plague already spoiled stuff on the podcast but you just don't know it yet
[2:23:47] <@PlagueOfGripes> sybaris is so fucking good
[2:23:49] <Rogue657> @AngriestPat spy stealth only matters when you actually enter the "A," "B," or "C" areas
[2:23:50] <+Daigrey> Name is Boivin...Fucc
[2:23:56] <Ace_Kuper> @AngriestPat Spoilers, your mum in fact runs on batteries or does she?
[2:24:01] <El_Samio> :O
[2:24:03] <%djinnJuice> I remain sad that the dex sybaris is pretty much strictly worse
[2:24:03] <Varanoo> >>>>>>>>STEALTH<<<<<<<<<<
[2:24:04] <+xXichibanballer> @PlagueOfGripes Why not call pat up and get on stream?
[2:24:11] <LORDSPOOKLEKINS> GOOD STEALTH

[2:24:12] <@PlagueOfGripes> need to get Pat a Loki, or Hush or something
[2:24:15] <Rogue657> @djinnJuice it isn't, what build are you running?
[2:24:15] <+augurgewalt> ruined
[2:24:17] <+OblivionSword1> @PlagueOfGripes did you get the prime sybaris ?
[2:24:21] <%Jp3g95> So if i want to get BACK into this game after say 2 years... is there a way to redo tutorial levels?
[2:24:21] <TheImmortal70> Sybaris is fine, but I don't like that it's a TWOSHOT burst. I want my large clip, fast firing guns
[2:24:22] <tangoragahn> Nonvault Alarms don't matter in Spy
[2:24:22] <Caidezes> lol
[2:24:22] <MajesticSundew> You can get detected as much as you want so long as you don't get detected in the vaults
[2:24:22] <+Phobaws06> you are ok
[2:24:25] <Zombrocom> So he bought titania with plat?
[2:24:26] <Rogue657> @djinnJuice it has outright better crit than prime even
[2:24:26] <@thenefftw> Negative Stealth
[2:24:33] <@PlagueOfGripes> GET CLEM
[2:24:34] <+Punchasaur> @el_samio also known as raiden

[2:24:37] <Shadowspartan110> MGS V Tier Stealth
[2:24:37] <Lysdexic9541> HE'S SO STEALTHY PogChamp
[2:24:38] <sassyquatch963> @OblivionSword1 that's the dex sybaris, it's an anniversary thing
[2:24:39] <+augurgewalt> GET GRAKATA
[2:24:40] <TezarroEX> good job, you failed the mission Kappa
[2:24:42] <Zombrocom> Ah. odd choice
[2:24:44] <+NiktenKing> Banshee is a walking hush zone
[2:24:45] <oppai_knight> CHAD CLEM
[2:24:46] <wookie5358> If you kill everything that moves, how can anything see you?
[2:24:47] <LoganPerseveres> "stealth is optional in this mission" kappa
[2:24:47] <KTDelgado> he just needs to run by everyone
[2:24:48] <Mittensbro> @Jp3g95 Ever since they remade the tutorial, I think they make you redo it...?
[2:24:49] <Varanoo> >>>>>>>>STEALTH<<<<<<<<<<
[2:24:51] <+SpookySpaghooti> @Jp3g95 no fucking idea, but it shouldnt be hard to get back in
[2:24:51] <+OblivionSword1> @sassyquatch963 I know
[2:24:51] <%djinnJuice> it has lower pretty much everything else though
[2:24:53] <Ace_Kuper> @PlagueOfGripes They made Loki better or you just want him to suffer?
[2:24:57] <Everpresent_Overseer> Pat guns make sounds when they shoot letting people know you are there xD
[2:25:00] <Cobra743> we should all just flood the stream with terms and machanics he in no way understands
[2:25:01] <+Ondartyr> He stealths just like Liam
[2:25:05] <Zombrocom> Hey, Loki is amazing
[2:25:06] <Rogue657> @djinnJuice Dex or normal? cause dex is still better than prime
[2:25:07] <oppai_knight> yeah i thought loki was a bit crummy these days
[2:25:09] <El_Samio> Pat, your guns actually make sounds
[2:25:12] <The_Maddness> @AngriestPat enemies are infinite, youre not going to kill them all
[2:25:14] <arfsm95> @AngriestPat so i can give you some mods, and some upgraded ones, do you want it?
[2:25:15] <Varanoo> GUNS MAKE NOISE
[2:25:17] <El_Samio> use melees to not alert enemies
[2:25:19] <Xiangchang> You should get the Ember Warframe at some point, and become a death god just by breathing and existing. It's pretty funny.
[2:25:20] <CertainlySyrix> nah, he's still broken as shit @oppai_knight
[2:25:25] <Zombrocom> Radioactive disarm and stealth are still a thing
[2:25:28] <+Confused_4K> Too bad Titania is my least favorite
[2:25:31] <+OblivionSword1> Dex sybaris is imo a bit better than prime
[2:25:34] <LORDSPOOKLEKINS> @oppai_knight Loki is still super good, you just have more options
[2:25:37] <Rogue657> @Xiangchang not anymore! lol, she got nerfed into the dirt.
[2:25:40] <%djinnJuice> what build makes dex better than prime...?
[2:25:43] <+xXichibanballer> @Xiangchang Bummer that Ember's range got nerfed though :(
[2:25:44] <Xiangchang> Oh, that stinks.
[2:25:47] <bleugh> warf rame
[2:25:47] <LORDSPOOKLEKINS> in terms of stealth frames that is
[2:25:47] <Rogue657> @djinnJuice Crit
[2:25:48] <+Punchasaur> speaking of Loki, he's totally dead in Infinity War
[2:25:53] <oppai_knight> damn, nice to hear loki's still goin strong
[2:25:58] <%djinnJuice> the crit build is still stronger on prime though
[2:25:58] <+augurgewalt> right
[2:26:02] <%Lordgale119> The ember nerf is a buff
[2:26:02] <+bloomingzonda> It's nice that he made his character look like his sister
[2:26:03] <@thenefftw> Remember, Pat: This is a sneaking mission
[2:26:06] <BearSawed> 3-2-1 aaaaaaand
[2:26:06] <+SpookySpaghooti> @djinnJuice Dex is special for Warframe's anniversary events, Prime is completely different
[2:26:07] <Twoiis> These low level ones are super easy though.
[2:26:07] <%Lordgale119> don't listen to their lies
[2:26:07] <MajesticSundew> @AngriestPat Spy missions usually have secret backdoor paths if you look around the environment
[2:26:08] <tierney12> Sybaris Prime is strictly better than Dex
[2:26:13] <El_Samio> "I'm very excited now... the anticipation..."
[2:26:15] <Varanoo> >>>>>>>>STEALTH<<<<<<<<<<

[2:27:35] <+OblivionSword1> Soo SSneaky

[2:27:58] <Cobra743> titania ios low tier as far as frames go
[2:27:58] <@PlagueOfGripes> Titania is cool looking guys
[2:27:59] <+Phobaws06> wait till you unlock the 4th ability
[2:28:12] <+Confused_4K> I wish Titania was good
[2:28:14] <+Ciphris> titania is good don't listen to chat
[2:28:15] <+JavaManJoJo> Oh he'll learn them if he decides to try and farm Ivara
[2:28:18] <@PlagueOfGripes> I want to see Pat's reaction to her 4
[2:28:18] <KTDelgado> @plagueofgripes but wheres the booty
[2:28:23] <zakti_prime> to be fair, spy vaults require trial and error if you don't look up tutorials
[2:28:23] <%djinnJuice> oh yeah he doesn't even have the 4
[2:28:29] <TezarroEX> theres a clear line in the development timeline when frames started to look cool
[2:28:30] <HypeArbalest> god dammit plague.
[2:28:30] <MajesticSundew> Titania is the true fashion frame
[2:28:32] <+xXichibanballer> I'm actually legit excited for pat to see her 4
[2:28:33] <+QuadraticGravity> All of the frames are good, lmao. This game is just a power trip.
[2:28:34] <PerfectlyGenericUsername> Does pat know about the gunblades?

[2:28:49] <cizal11> will he fuck it up
[2:28:51] <+xXichibanballer> @QuadraticGravity Mag isn't good
[2:28:53] <BaronVonWolfe> Titania is fine. She needs a reworked first ability, and vacuum in Razorwing.
[2:28:54] <%djinnJuice> I'm glad he got the sensor
[2:28:56] <bit_guardian> He's gonna crash into walls and doors

[2:32:29] <+quarkee> @angeiestpat theres also a website you can go to that loads up a round 100 streams at once so you can get MAD LOOT
[2:32:30] <+JustbeJake> Can you prove it's nice, empirically?
[2:32:30] <%Larshas> Look at these giant sneaky firefights
[2:32:31] <+preppyposs> they fun
[2:32:31] <Noponiz> they are SO fun
[2:32:31] <grayjammer> Canada is for Big Dummo's

[2:32:37] <+MarshallLee67> spy missions are super fun
[2:32:38] <+McSnazzyPants> you say that until you run it with randos
[2:32:38] <LORDSPOOKLEKINS> Time to get pat ivara
[2:32:38] <sunriser696> big canada for big boys
[2:32:40] <Xanax44> It kinda blows my mind that Pat is already entrenched into the WF community, already having a referral link and everything
[2:32:43] <%Fenrirlives> Space Mom: no fucking swearing on my motherfucking profile bitch
[2:32:43] <%djinnJuice> I come back and forth on liking spy
[2:32:43] <Zombrocom> Yeah well
[2:32:43] <%Aldurin_> @AngriestPat don't fool me, Canada is full of high-level encounters like the Moose that does Maple Syrup damage with its melee attacks
[2:32:43] <%captainthunderwolf> "Canada is not a fuck." apatCrazyhead apatCrazyhead
[2:32:44] <+augurgewalt> Farm Ivara and say that again
[2:32:44] <Volkrotia> They get cool and crazy later
[2:32:44] <+MarshallLee67> holy shit lmao
[2:32:45] <Kaffeebohnson> Spy missions = favorite? Head explodes.
[2:32:45] <StooEsq> You say that now...
[2:32:46] <bit_guardian> Slick dodge
[2:32:46] <zakti_prime> until....THOSE spy missions
[2:32:47] <+other_badger> VAC
[2:32:47] <%acktuallyron> Wait til you get to play Ivara on them
[2:32:48] <Zanpa> they're even better when you use silent weapons
[2:32:49] <GiantRobort> glad you like spy missions have fun doing them over and over for Ivara!
[2:32:49] <Zombrocom> Wait til ya have to grind Ivara
[2:32:49] <hecadisth> they get ever better later / in later planets
[2:32:50] <malletman241> BET YOU VOTE PQ
[2:32:52] <%Ablestron> @AngriestPat if you like stealth and movement challenge missions, youre gonna LOVE Ivara
[2:32:52] <+gozzojt27> cept lua spy, ya
[2:32:52] <+unfoldingchoas> If done right spy mission can level you up quick
[2:32:52] <@PlagueOfGripes> I love Spy missions. But wait till you want Ivara or a specific mod. Then you will not love them
[2:32:53] <El_Samio> :O
[2:32:54] <SunsetJack> This one sucks...
[2:32:54] <MajesticSundew> You're gonna enjoy some of the later ones then for sure
[2:32:57] <GoldeNOVA> DE giving that big Canadian "soo-ry"
[2:32:57] <Lysdexic9541> "AssociOSHIT"
[2:32:58] <KingOfTheGeats> wait till you get to the moon missions
[2:32:58] <The_Maddness> oh god
[2:32:58] <+PatCat1> Pat how do you have Titania?
[2:32:59] <MidKnight_24> I can only imagine pat's reaction to spy missions on Lua
[2:33:04] <zakti_prime> time travel
[2:33:07] <The_Maddness> SPY MISSIONS are the favorite?
[2:33:07] <+other_badger> someone gifted him titania
[2:33:09] <El_Samio> PatCat1, gift from a fan
[2:33:09] <TezarroEX> weirdo, you'll be beaten into submission to love defense missions instead
[2:33:11] <%Ablestron> @AngriestPat Ivara is the endgame frame for spy missions
[2:33:12] <+SpookySpaghooti> @PatCat1 someone gifted it to him
[2:33:14] <Noponiz> I hope they add more spy missions soon. the more vault variation the better
[2:33:16] <+OranHexthief> just do loki and ignore lasers though LUL
[2:33:16] <MajesticSundew> Can't go that way gotta go this way
[2:33:16] <fattness132> @PlagueOfGripes Gotta farm spy to get ivara to farm more spy missions
[2:33:17] <%commanderclaw> Stealth missions are fun until you have to grind them out
[2:33:20] <TheFranss> If yu really love spy missions cant wait you to get to the hardest one
[2:33:23] <KTDelgado> ivara trivializes spys
[2:33:26] <GoldeNOVA> You say that
[2:33:29] <+Stackmaster20> Anyone watch that dbfz final
[2:33:29] <tangoragahn> You're gonna love lategame spy missions
[2:33:31] <kamenxriderxAO> what is war frame
[2:33:31] <LORDSPOOKLEKINS> @PlagueOfGripes I fucking gave up trying to farm her and just bought her.100 spy missions and only get like one of her parts.
[2:33:34] <bit_guardian> Plague is biased by the booty.
[2:33:37] <%djinnJuice> to be fair I literally never want to get titania legit ever
[2:33:38] <fruit_pie_the_magician> i never did lua spy missions until they were on a sortie, than I had to
[2:33:40] <El_Samio> Holy shit, Pat's gonna stealth 2 rooms
[2:33:40] <GoldeNOVA> Spy missions are great if you're Loki
[2:33:41] <Noponiz> this room is a bit confusing
[2:33:43] <GoldeNOVA> At least late game ones
[2:33:44] <%djinnJuice> I don't have time in my life to scan plants
[2:33:45] <+OranHexthief> underwater spy missions though NotLikeThis
[2:33:46] <SunsetJack> It turns off one of the lasers Pat.
[2:33:47] <mcevers> oof this is the worst vault
[2:33:50] <+MarshallLee67> spy missions in later tilesets get super complicated and great
[2:33:51] <%commanderclaw> I love the hip to waist ratios of the female frames
[2:33:57] <+augurgewalt> Ivara frog booty is top tier
[2:33:57] <%Fenrirlives> @AngriestPat have you suffered through interception missions yet
[2:34:00] <tierney12> sharkwing Kreygasm
[2:34:01] <%InsomniacPersona> Level Design!
[2:34:08] <sassyquatch963> there's something beautiful about him playing the bug frame, and repeatedly flying into actual glass
[2:34:09] <SunsetJack> There is glass lol.
[2:34:11] <@PlagueOfGripes> Spy missions can be completed in seconds if you know the right hidden route
[2:34:12] <+Punchasaur> this stealthy, glowing robot with fucking racing stripes
[2:34:15] <Varanoo> glass
[2:34:15] <korean_random> glass
[2:34:20] <grayjammer> I straight-up still don't understand the layout of this spy tile
[2:34:22] <%commanderclaw> SHOOT THE GLASS
[2:34:34] <+MarshallLee67> holy shit pat is doing it the good way
[2:34:36] <morcego_cinzento> You know i really like this appeal of a fairy/witch type characters that floats around and uses a rifle. Think like what Bullet Witch tried to do(never played it, so i don't know if it was good or bad)
[2:34:37] <SunsetJack> He turns off the second one, nice.
[2:34:39] <Noponiz> you are turning off lasers
[2:34:40] <Rogue657> @grayjammer there's a tunnel directly above you when you start the mission that drops you straight into the end room
[2:34:42] <bit_guardian> Turned off the lazer
[2:34:44] <cizal11> i can't believe he bullshit his way into turning off both barriers without having any idea
[2:34:49] <TheFranss> Dank title design. Exploring each title in mission is nice because there are hidden rooms around
[2:34:49] <%InsomniacPersona> shoot the glass
[2:34:50] <LORDSPOOKLEKINS> LUL
[2:34:50] <%Aldurin_> you accidentally did this correctly and I'm amazed
[2:34:51] <cizal11> LMAO
[2:34:51] <+MarshallLee67> aw
[2:34:52] <sassyquatch963> GOT SEEN
[2:34:52] <Zanpa> LUL
[2:34:54] <@PlagueOfGripes> he's gonna fail this one

[2:34:55] <+augurgewalt> ruined
[2:34:56] <TheFranss> PAT NO
[2:34:57] <%MGKBurrito> @AngriestPat you turned off annoying lazer sensors

[2:35:11] <@thenefftw> How do all the doors open?
[2:35:14] <+augurgewalt> this one is pretty unintuitive though
[2:35:15] <+gozzojt27> F
[2:35:15] <fruit_pie_the_magician> second floor to the right
[2:35:15] <+babyacid> up
[2:35:16] <+CaptainVore> look at minimap to find the other switches
[2:35:17] <GoldeNOVA> @AngriestPat You can wall latch if you aim near a wall
[2:35:18] <Varanoo> F
[2:35:20] <KTDelgado> but he still passes the mission sadly
[2:35:21] <zakti_prime> f to pay respects

[2:35:27] <shevan123> you FAILED
[2:35:27] <+babyacid> UP ovcerlooking the door
[2:35:29] <%djinnJuice> I think this one's fucked if he pops the alarm
[2:35:30] <%AnOverdoseOfDeath> It's fine, it's fine.
[2:35:30] <Tearonex> Panic
[2:35:31] <suikudo> its not a sortie so its ok
[2:35:32] <tangoragahn> Theres a console on a balcony
[2:35:33] <+ruddyredbone> I alway hated this one
[2:35:33] <Bncbck> WELCOME TO THE WARFARM PAT
[2:35:33] <+fireking900> DIG UP STUPID
[2:35:34] <+AcidicHorizon> F
[2:35:34] <Twoiis> 2/3 is a pass
[2:35:34] <+Phobaws06> its ok tho
[2:35:35] <TheSpartanThief> I could tell him about the roof vent, but it'd take too long to be seen...and he won't look at me.
[2:35:36] <TheFranss> There's a console on the catwalk on
[2:35:37] <bit_guardian> Only need two
[2:35:38] <SunsetJack> Oh well, 2 out of 3 is good.
[2:35:39] <+Confused_4K> CLEAN EXTRACTION
[2:35:42] <+xXichibanballer> I legit hate this room too
[2:35:44] <Rogue657> @grayjammer yeah took me a bit to find too. still, you can get the console despite the scanners if you're quick
[2:35:44] <El_Samio> you dissapointes spacemom
[2:35:46] <TheFranss> that opens the door
[2:35:46] <MajesticSundew> @Angriest pat you don't need to get all of them, you just get better rewards for getting all 3
[2:35:48] <+augurgewalt> you only need one most missions, sometimes two
[2:35:49] <Everpresent_Overseer> Panic kill everything
[2:35:55] <tangoragahn> ANOTHER HAPPY LANDING
[2:35:56] <@PlagueOfGripes> you have to use the console you used before, then a console located UNDER your objective and it lets you hack the console inside without exploding
[2:36:00] <fruit_pie_the_magician> this spy mission actually only has one terminal that opens that door, and its basically above you
[2:36:01] <Twoiis> failing 2 is a failed mission.
[2:36:01] <SunsetJack> There was a console above and behind you Pat.
[2:36:01] <oppai_knight> HARRASSED BY BALLS LIVE ON STREAM
[2:36:07] <+Punchasaur> pat if you like stealth and movement challenges, play Dishonered
[2:36:07] <+LegendCobra> did he get Titania the legit way or did someone give it to him?
[2:36:08] <boom1430> woo warframe stream flashgitzRavicorn
[2:36:17] <%InsomniacPersona> You can shoot the glass wall
[2:36:22] <TheSpartanThief> Look up
[2:36:24] <+preppyposs> someone gave it to him
[2:36:29] <FrostFang127> So Pat, how is Warframe treating you? :D
[2:36:30] <TyrantBelial> There was a commandf console on a catwalk that opoened the doorm, and two more consoles that turn off lasers in the room
[2:36:30] <KTDelgado> theres a whole in the roof for it
[2:36:31] <LORDSPOOKLEKINS> YES
[2:36:31] <pswayde> yep
[2:36:31] <%Ablestron> YES
[2:36:32] <Bncbck> YES
[2:36:32] <NoirePanzer> DIG UP
[2:36:33] <SunsetJack> Yes
[2:36:33] <+Castlefronk> That's the one
[2:36:34] <+augurgewalt> yes
[2:36:35] <+babyacid> you turned off the internal security
[2:36:35] <+ItsAGundamu> Jesus WTF am I looking at
[2:36:35] <Varanoo> yes
[2:36:35] <Aleate> Thats the one for the door, yes
[2:36:36] <TheFranss> @AngriestPat that one, yes
[2:36:36] <%Ablestron> it was that one yes
[2:36:37] <TyrantBelial> Yes
[2:36:39] <+babyacid> YES
[2:36:43] <oppai_knight> pat replicating the true bug experience of flying around erratically
[2:36:44] <+spookysenpai20xx> I hope pat plays enough to make his ship HAINTED
[2:36:50] <+babyacid> the other two turned off the lazers
[2:36:52] <+LegendCobra> oh god I hate the BO
[2:36:52] <+MarshallLee67> there is also a secret vent above where you first walk in
[2:36:57] <+Doctor_Scoots> The other two consoles removed lasers in that room
[2:36:58] <KTDelgado> theres a hole in the room
[2:37:01] <MajesticSundew> Spy missions usually have multiple paths
[2:37:02] <+Phobaws06> 1 level more a habemus 4th ability
[2:37:07] <Noponiz> that floating guy attracts the others
[2:37:13] <+ruddyredbone> they stop attacking
[2:37:16] <+Castlefronk> @AngriestPat That ability distracts enemies and makes them shoot at that instead of you
[2:37:16] <Rogue657> @AngriestPat it turns one enemy into a thing that attracts others, you can press it again to turn it off
[2:37:16] <Noponiz> it turns the target into a decoy basically
[2:37:17] <aeonicvector> your 3 is one target who draws aggro
[2:37:17] <pswayde> I attracts enemies, which then take damage
[2:37:18] <BearSawed> Read the abilities tab in options
[2:37:23] <+LegendCobra> it creates a bomb that attracts enemies
[2:37:26] <fruit_pie_the_magician> After you shoot them you get a buff with that ability
[2:37:26] <+TheSwinns> so how is pat enjoying warframe?
[2:37:28] <zakti_prime> lantern mesmerizes enemies
[2:37:31] <SunsetJack> That room had 2 lasers surveying the console you need to hack. You deactivated both of them which was good.
[2:37:33] <oppai_knight> there may be a bo, but is there a BIG BO
[2:37:35] <+McSnazzyPants> @AngriestPat you can pause and go to abilities to view each one
[2:37:41] <%bv728> It's the Grineer. It's ALWAYS the grineer
[2:37:41] <tierney12> it's the grineer LUL
[2:37:55] <+augurgewalt> A large security force... it's the grineer
[2:37:57] <SainVt> this game is fucking sick im glad you're playing it
[2:37:59] <+LegendCobra> what's his mastery rank at
[2:38:02] <bit_guardian> Their brains are cloned blob fish
[2:38:04] <+captain_elsewhere> 3

[2:38:13] <+Ciphris> grineer ship i wonder if there's going to be grineer in it
[2:38:19] <%Bloko07> GG
[2:38:19] <zaptar13> @angriestpat Hey Pat, I'm planning to get my first gaming desktop for my birthday. Any recommendations?
[2:38:19] <+LegendCobra> how did he get his hands on titania
[2:38:22] <TheFranss> All clap in joy
[2:38:23] <Bncbck> BUTTERFLY TIME
[2:38:23] <LORDSPOOKLEKINS> BUFFERFLY TIME
[2:38:23] <+TheSwinns> has he spent money?
[2:38:24] <bit_guardian> Gift
[2:38:25] <%TaifuDragon> Doors are locked. Time to break in
[2:38:27] <+SpookySpaghooti> BUTTERFLY
[2:38:27] <+LegendCobra> I assume he hasn't done second dream yet
[2:38:28] <+other_badger> titania gifted
[2:38:32] <+Phobaws06> 4th ability GO
[2:38:33] <+augurgewalt> 4th ability unlocked

[2:38:35] <AgentOfParanoia> So this is what Warframe is
[2:38:36] <@PlagueOfGripes> good ol Dex Sybian.
[2:38:36] <El_Samio> nah, he hasn't gotten into mars even
[2:38:36] <+unfoldingchoas> @theswinns no
[2:38:38] <+Confused_4K> BUTTERFLY IN THE SKY
[2:38:39] <bit_guardian> He is so gonna crash
[2:38:41] <%Ablestron> @AngriestPat the thing lorewise about the grineer is that they are clones soldiers that have been cloned so muc hthat theyre sterile and melting because of the shitty gene code getting fucked up
[2:38:41] <zakti_prime> titania 10!
[2:38:43] <+SpookySpaghooti> @LegendCobra hell no, he has a long wa y to go
[2:38:44] <alebeard> has pat been running solo the entire time?
[2:38:45] <NemokillerV> butterfly form go
[2:38:46] <+other_badger> he's looking forward to second dream though, he's unspiled as of yet
[2:38:51] <+LegendCobra> Titania's ult is so fun
[2:38:55] <tierney12> heated charge Kreygasm
[2:38:56] <Bncbck> too bad he doesnt have the syndi mod :D
[2:38:57] <Rellim80> @AngriestPat is it safe to say this looks like you're playing Mass Effect as an Anime Geth?
[2:39:00] <SunsetJack> You should mod your weapons again. They should have more space since they are potatoed.
[2:39:01] <cizal11> it's based on your mastery rank
[2:39:01] <+Ultimatefool> Depends on your Mastery Rank
[2:39:03] <KTDelgado> ITS READING RAINDOW
[2:39:04] <aeonicvector> but that goes up as your MR does
[2:39:04] <bit_guardian> Cap increases with master rank
[2:39:04] <+augurgewalt> its basis + 1000 per MR
[2:39:07] <+TheMattman1313> @AngriestPat So are there like a bajillion abilities like FFXIV or like 4 (and tied to the warframe)?
[2:39:07] <%MGKBurrito> does he even have a regalia on?
[2:39:07] <+OranHexthief> thats something else entirely @PlagueOfGripes woops2B
[2:39:08] <+Castlefronk> @AngriestPat You can gain more max daily standing the higher your mastery rank is
[2:39:08] <%Ablestron> your standing increases with ranks
[2:39:09] <%Fenrirlives> alright pat gotta go to work! see ya later. will be sure to draw you with a pretty butterfly!
[2:39:13] <+Punchasaur> is Nier Automata good on PC? It was on sale so I impulse bought it
[2:39:20] <MajesticSundew> COOKED DOGGO
[2:39:20] <tangoragahn> 1000 standing plus 1000 per MR
[2:39:21] <TheSpartanThief> Standing depends on you MR
[2:39:22] <AgentOfParanoia> S
[2:39:22] <@thenefftw> Cook your dog to make them grow
[2:39:22] <+babyacid> MORE MASTERY = MORE DAILY STANDING
[2:39:23] <BearSawed> CHECK YOUR MAIL
[2:39:24] <TyrantBelial> Time to fight a boss pat!
[2:39:25] <PulverKong> So I'm downloading the game now. What do I have to spend real money on?
[2:39:26] <+other_badger> nier has some issues on pc but it's not terrible
[2:39:27] <CertainlySyrix> @Punchasaur broken port, some fan patches for it that fix it up
[2:39:28] <cizal11> yes, but you need to get the FAR mod
[2:39:28] <PulverKong> since it's free
[2:39:29] <PerfectlyGenericUsername> Can you build the heat sword?
[2:39:30] <LORDSPOOKLEKINS> Oh cool thing most people probably don't know.If you channel your melee weapon the moment a enemy tries to melee you you ACTUALLY get a fucking parry.
[2:39:32] <hecadisth> scales up with your mastery rank

[2:42:48] <tangoragahn> READ EXCALIBUR's CODEX
[2:42:50] <@PlagueOfGripes> a good plan

[2:58:47] <$ThePaleSage> Oh boy

[2:58:49] <Varanoo> KEK
[2:58:50] <mrdazg> LUL LUL LUL
[2:58:51] <Slim_Lipid> A mission? In MY Asia?
[2:58:51] <%Arnschen> Yay
[2:58:51] <%MGKBurrito> at least he realzied quick
[2:58:54] <El_Samio> "SHIT!"
[2:58:54] <HexMasterMike> Four years and I still leave the datamass behind almost every single time.
[2:58:58] <faegbeard> Number of open squads in Eurasia just shot up to 10 from 2, good attempts to get on stream boys
[2:58:59] <Feathy> Adaptive AI is getting better
[2:59:11] <El_Samio> he's on Solo tho, so good luck
[2:59:13] <bit_guardian> TO sane people yes. Pat loves MH tho and this type of dumb complexity sold him on it.
[2:59:16] <Everpresent_Overseer> Says he is the best as he forgets the Data Mass love it
[2:59:25] <+augurgewalt> Should have brought frost
[2:59:25] <pswayde> thats completely fine
[2:59:26] <MajesticSundew> That's fine
[2:59:30] <$BenLubar> pat wants dumb complexity? has he tried Dwarf Fortress?
[2:59:31] <TezarroEX> mobile defense is not that hard solo
[2:59:31] <+AXL808> Make sure to get a kubrow
[2:59:32] <+fireking900> same
[2:59:37] <BearSawed> Sure, warframe hitler
[2:59:38] <+babyacid> you're doing fine
[2:59:42] <El_Samio> he's already cooking a doggo
[2:59:44] <MajesticSundew> You don't have to justify what feels comfortable for you
[2:59:47] <Worldbrand> the kubrow is honestly a resource sink for new players
[2:59:57] <Gorgen> you can use sidearm an melee when holding it
[3:00:01] <$BenLubar> Hey @AngriestPat have you ever tried to exit ViM?
[3:00:02] <@thenefftw> Smol Pat
[3:00:04] <Cobra743> NAVI PATIS REAL!!!!!
[3:00:09] <@thenefftw> Take that sound bite
[3:00:10] <+augurgewalt> Oom incoming
[3:00:12] <%Remery_> Petite Pat
[3:00:13] <bit_guardian> So long as he is having fun doing what he's doing that's all he needs.
[3:00:18] <%InsomniacPersona> BUTTERFLY TWICE AS HIGH
[3:00:19] <Feathy> PIXIE MAN!!!!!
[3:00:20] <AoG_JarlRaven> See what I mean? See what I mean?
[3:00:20] <$ThePaleSage> Bites za Dusto
[3:00:21] <bit_guardian> Pat use melee in this form. It has homing.
[3:00:23] <+Phobaws06> the mods on your primary affect titania's 4 weapon
[3:00:24] <Surfinbear> melee in pixie
[3:00:29] <%Ablestron> IM IN A BOOK
[3:00:29] <+Ciphris> warframes have busted powers
[3:00:29] <Cobra743> NAVI PAT
[3:00:31] <ECRead> @AngriestPat thanks for the 2 tempered Bagel Goose advice. beat it first try
[3:00:33] <%Ablestron> READING RAINBOW?
[3:00:33] <KTDelgado> I WANT HIM TO SEE NIDUS
[3:00:35] <%Gogogolem> So why did somone give him the weirdest warframe in the game?
[3:00:41] <%Remery_> Wish Pat was my Tinkerbell
[3:00:42] <bit_guardian> Most of the are "MOBA level" ults
[3:00:48] <love_plays> @Gogogolem Titania's awesome, gitgud
[3:00:53] <tangoragahn> Phoba he's using auto install
[3:00:54] <+other_badger> weirdest frame is probably limbo
[3:00:54] <+augurgewalt> This is Titania not Limbo, she is not that weird
[3:00:59] <+unfoldingchoas> block
[3:01:02] <El_Samio> Pat just discovered this game has character-action style melee
[3:01:04] <Finaldragoon> "easier to move with controller"
[3:01:04] <denaz5000> he coud have gotten limbo
[3:01:06] <bit_guardian> @Gogogolem cause they know how to entertain us
[3:01:07] <%Arnschen> Limbo is fun as hell
[3:01:10] <%Gogogolem> @love_plays She still weird
[3:01:11] <puddingpants88> those look like 40k space Marines
[3:01:12] <Gorgen> does she still lose her sentinel when in fairymode?
[3:01:12] <+AXL808> agreed, Limbo probably weirdest frame
[3:01:16] <+gozzojt27> he needs to see tentacle frame
[3:01:20] <mcevers> Nidus is weird as shit
[3:01:20] <bit_guardian> I love me some Limbo.
[3:01:22] <puddingpants88> IT SAYS YOU'RE A HERETIC
[3:01:23] <TheSpartanThief> Limbo is Dio
[3:01:30] <Peashooter117> Limbo is basically DIO though so... ye
[3:01:31] <bit_guardian> za warudo
[3:01:32] <+other_badger> mummy man is also weird
[3:01:34] <%MGKBurrito> hydroid is pretty weird
[3:01:35] <love_plays> @Gogogolem how can you even say Titania is weird when Nidus exists lmao
[3:01:36] <tierney12> Limbo is actually an asshole
[3:01:38] <mrdazg> i looked exactly this dumb when i played for the first time, this is too real man
[3:01:38] <tangoragahn> Nidus is the most complex by far
[3:01:39] <%MGKBurrito> can turn into a wave
[3:01:39] <+augurgewalt> hydroid looks weird, but all the elementframes are pretty straightforward
[3:01:42] <Twoiis> Limbo has a nice hat.
[3:01:45] <FATMANNUKE> is pat channeling by accident or am I just hearing shit?
[3:01:50] <fruit_pie_the_magician> Nidus is amazing but farming him sucks ass
[3:01:51] <JusTTheGuyYouNeed> Limbo is fun
[3:01:55] <%Arnschen> Time stop shenanigans are the best
[3:01:56] <@thenefftw> I can't wait to get Limbo
[3:01:57] <TezarroEX> we need frog waifu up in here tho
[3:01:58] <+gozzojt27> if you main bimbo i dislike you and what you stand for
[3:01:58] <tangoragahn> Stack UI would frighten newbies away
[3:01:59] <chthonaut> Band LEader Octavia is best girl.
[3:02:00] <bit_guardian> He consistently channels I believe.
[3:02:04] <Dairaipie> Did anyone make a sbf clan for warframe
[3:02:06] <+captain_elsewhere> inaros is undead god emperor of I DONT GIVE A FUCK
[3:02:22] <%Gogogolem> @love_plays Because Nidus doens't have a bizzare unique mechanic exclusive to him
[3:02:23] <Gorgen> ^
[3:02:26] <+Ciphris> inaros god of pocket sand
[3:02:27] <+augurgewalt> Valkyr is Berserker Kitty
[3:02:29] <%Arnschen> Probably going to switch to Octavia once I get there though
[3:02:31] <love_plays> @Gogogolem you fucking what lol
[3:02:34] <Rogue657> @bit_guardian he just has weapon trails always on, he doesn't always channel
[3:02:36] <+OblivionSword1> Inaros gives no shit
[3:02:37] <Deadbulky> Thats some cute babby damage
[3:02:40] <+Feltal> @captain_elsewhere and nidus is undying god emperor of idgaf
[3:02:44] <FATMANNUKE> i think it would be a bit hasty to make an sbf clan lol
[3:02:44] <10deez> He's using a controller, ew
[3:02:46] <Everpresent_Overseer> Melee as Pixie
[3:02:49] <love_plays> @Gogogolem what are mutation stacks lmfao
[3:02:53] <TyrantBelial> @AngriestPat your ult has a melee attack too
[3:02:57] <+gozzojt27> hes only seen 2 ults though, lol
[3:02:59] <+AXL808> I feel like such a fucker whenever I play Inaros and just throw sand in people's eyes
[3:03:07] <love_plays> pocket sand best 1
[3:03:10] <bit_guardian> @Rogue657 I see, I have a potato. So I don't get to see the pretty.
[3:03:11] <+M4T1A5> excalibur is like the first frame too
[3:03:14] <%Gogogolem> @love_plays Okay i forgot about the mustation stack
[3:03:18] <+augurgewalt> excalibur is really straightforward, that is why he is a beginner frame
[3:03:19] <love_plays> @Gogogolem git. gud.
[3:03:24] <MidKnight_24> I also prefer the controller and I find movement easier with it, nothing wrong with that
[3:03:26] <tangoragahn> Gara has pocket glass as 1
[3:03:29] <DeadRuins> Pat, let us play with you
[3:03:30] <outis94> damn the new dead to rights episode is ridiculous
[3:03:44] <sassyquatch963> @AngriestPat let us play with you damnit
[3:03:45] <+dolvusman76> Pat running solo?
[3:03:47] <+augurgewalt> frost has snow globes, so you dont need to defend the objective
[3:03:47] <love_plays> thank god Gara's good again
[3:03:47] <FATMANNUKE> @deadruins bad idea
[3:03:57] <+TeethMuncher> @outis94 the graphics really hold up
[3:03:58] <+Punchasaur> is the FAR mod necessary for Nier if I have a GTX 1070?
[3:04:02] <+Feltal> @Gogogolem nidus is bizarre all around, he throw umbilical cords and maggots at people
[3:04:06] <Twoiis> Such a pretty fairy.
[3:04:21] <bit_guardian> If we play we'll run him over. Best to let him learn by doing.
[3:04:22] <chiglit> @Punchasaur id say yes as it fixes the incorrect resolution
[3:04:25] <+SpookySpaghooti> Ok chat, favorite Warframe GO
[3:04:26] <%Gogogolem> @AngriestPat Oh yeah in that form your butterflies do Damage over time as well
[3:04:29] <El_Samio> Atlas
[3:04:29] <+augurgewalt> Titania needs more skins asap
[3:04:30] <+SpookySpaghooti> Harrow
[3:04:31] <bit_guardian> Inaros
[3:04:31] <+Feltal> Nova
[3:04:32] <Gorgen> Inaros
[3:04:34] <BaronVonWolfe> Mesa
[3:04:37] <GoldeNOVA> Excalibur does a Bankai
[3:04:37] <mrdazg> Valkyr
[3:04:39] <sassyquatch963> @SpookySpaghooti mesa
[3:04:40] <+skibbz_> Harrow
[3:04:41] <MidKnight_24> Trinity
[3:04:43] <Twoiis> Saryn
[3:04:43] <+captain_elsewhere> rhino
[3:04:44] <Peashooter117> Chroma
[3:04:44] <Zombrocom> I adore atlas
[3:04:46] <%TaifuDragon> Equinox
[3:04:47] <Solidus_113> Oberon
[3:04:48] <Storm_Samurai> What is red aura that appears places he is
[3:04:48] <alpharius88> Mesa
[3:04:48] <UvBenServed> Oberon
[3:04:49] <cizal11> SPRINT
[3:04:51] <faegbeard> Volt
[3:04:51] <tangoragahn> Nidus using Stacks as casts built by his 1 is unintuitive af
[3:04:51] <+dolvusman76> Trinity
[3:04:52] <MajesticSundew> Excal all day every day
[3:04:53] <+AXL808> If Pat played with other people I imagine he would spend the time just trying to keep up as some Ember blazes through the map with her ult
[3:04:55] <AoG_JarlRaven> This game seems so weird to me i cant categorize it NotLikeThis
[3:05:00] <+TootPirate> You can sprint/boost while flying aswell
[3:05:01] <+dolvusman76> That slam has less range than you think
[3:05:02] <ragasquid> fuck you guys make me want to get back into warframe
[3:05:05] <FATMANNUKE> although idk how much pat likes forced time gates in games
[3:05:07] <+Feltal> @tangoragahn how?
[3:05:10] <+Phobaws06> keep sprint and jump pressed while in pixie mod
[3:05:11] <+augurgewalt> Ember is not as bad now though
[3:05:13] <+SpookySpaghooti> @AoG_JarlRaven it's a Parkour / Cooking simulator
[3:05:14] <+Phobaws06> you go much faster
[3:05:16] <bit_guardian> @Storm_Samurai It's Titania's passive. It's a pad that increases allied jump effectiveness.
[3:05:19] <Shadow__atronach> had no idea pat plays warframe
[3:05:19] <austinj24> This game looks so much different from when i last played
[3:05:25] <%MisterCrimson> Space Ninja Wizard Character Action
[3:05:25] <%Ablestron> Currently I am really digging Nidus, he's a infested boi and I gave him a bunch of infested weapons
[3:05:34] <+Javaa01> Pat, when you're in your compact form as Titania, when you're sprinting, also hold the jump button to go extra fast
[3:05:35] <+HawluchaLibre> Did pat ever get the Dex Dakra?
[3:05:37] <NoirePanzer> Speed run the levels
[3:05:38] <tierney12> @AoG_JarlRaven it's an instance based co-op looter 3rd person shooter
[3:05:39] <69nairra> farming sword gun space alien shoot em up parkour
[3:05:39] <+captain_elsewhere> he started today Shadow__atronach plague tempted him
[3:05:43] <+fireking900> man i cant wait for pat to try to explain warframe to everyone on the podcast
[3:05:44] <tangoragahn> Because to a newbie abilities use energy and nothing else
[3:05:44] <love_plays> @tangoragahn eh, Nidus only consumes stacks for his 3, 4, and self-resurrection. the rest of the time they just boost the power of his 1 and 2.
[3:05:47] <$OmegaWeltall> get your ass to Mars
[3:05:48] <Solidus_113> @AngriestPat remember you're still on solo mode
[3:05:49] <Peashooter117> Pat just wanted to let you know that Limbo is basically DIO
[3:05:49] <bit_guardian> It's Barbie dress up game
[3:05:49] <Everpresent_Overseer> Valkyr will always be my favorite
[3:05:50] <@PlagueOfGripes> now get your ass beat
[3:05:52] <Storm_Samurai> it's a sci-fi free-to-play cooperative third-person shooter what's hard to understand
[3:05:54] <+KhazperGaming> I'm a Rhyno scrub
[3:05:57] <@PlagueOfGripes> you haven't gotten anything yet
[3:05:58] <hecadisth> 25 scanners*
[3:05:59] <bit_guardian> @PlagueOfGripes God I hope so
[3:06:00] <+M4T1A5> it's a really good game too. personally have like 1300 hours logged
[3:06:00] <+augurgewalt> Fragor is big hammer for big bois
[3:06:03] <N1netbattler> You know they are working on a fighting game mode?
[3:06:06] <+Punchasaur> @chiglit i'm trying to install the special k installer but the windows 7 version link doesn't seem to exist anymore
[3:06:08] <69nairra> mini boss PogChamp
[3:06:10] <+gozzojt27> yay, archwing soon...
[3:06:10] <%Gogogolem> who thinks Pats gonna fail this one?
[3:06:11] <TezarroEX> fight your reflection, pat
[3:06:11] <%InkblotBlues> You'll beast this.
[3:06:12] <El_Samio> Jat Kitty is the big hammer for big bois
[3:06:13] <Storm_Samurai> @M4T1A5 only 1300? lol
[3:06:13] <TezarroEX> do it
[3:06:14] <cizal11> it's hard to lose to these guys tbh
[3:06:14] <%Ablestron> MINI BOSS TIME
[3:06:16] <Shadow__atronach> wait im farther then patt?!
[3:06:16] <cizal11> but pat could do it
[3:06:16] <%InkblotBlues> Don't worry about it.
[3:06:18] <+augurgewalt> they get much tougher
[3:06:19] <+TeethMuncher> @AngriestPat are ya winnin' son
[3:06:21] <@thenefftw> Time to use your abilities and destroy this fuck
[3:06:22] <+AXL808> Pat needs the wiki page on a quick tab to know what these things are
[3:06:26] <MajesticSundew> I wish the archwing wasn't the worst thing ever created
[3:06:32] <bit_guardian> @N1netbattler I saw that in the Devstream but I thought t was a small like April Fool's day thing.
[3:06:32] <Gorgen> i forgot junctions were in the game
[3:06:37] <tangoragahn> Excal gonna give it to ya
[3:06:39] <TruTrashMan> Is this just what a PvE based Hero shooter looks like?
[3:06:41] <love_plays> The Archwing SHOULD be the best thing ever :/
[3:06:42] <FATMANNUKE> if it controlled better archwing might be fun
[3:06:46] <+McSnazzyPants> i had to do all the relays after coming back from like a year break, it was really weird doing them after the fact
[3:06:49] <+xXichibanballer> They should just turn archwings into starfox
[3:06:51] <+other_badger> excalibutr trivialises these for like 5 more planets
[3:06:57] <+preppyposs> frost
[3:06:58] <+M4T1A5> @Storm_Samurai well i have a feeling i need another 1300 hours to get everything done at the plains
[3:07:01] <Zombrocom> OHNO

[3:07:23] <+gozzojt27> tiem to shoot your space dick
[3:07:23] <%SirRosstopher> took him down like a russian spy on a park bench

[3:07:28] <oppai_knight> whoa he turned into actual size pat for a while there
[3:07:29] <Shadowspartan110> @AngriestPat When you get to Maroo's do her weekly quest more than once cause it takes you to this thing called a challenge room. If you meet the target time you can get into this room that has a chance to drop the uncracked versions of some of your warframe based mods
[3:07:29] <+MarshallLee67> YEYEYE
[3:07:30] <tierney12> @PlagueOfGripes i thought sneks were your weakness Kappa
[3:07:32] <%InkblotBlues> The junctions aren't that hard until maybe pluto.
[3:07:36] <%Ablestron> LETS GET SOME GET SMOKEDs HERE IN CHAT
[3:07:46] <GoldeNOVA> Junctions are EZPZ
[3:07:49] <pswayde> god the junction sequence is so cool
[3:07:54] <+ccwettr123> @AngriestPat wait till you get the frame that fights with music
[3:07:55] <MidKnight_24> I think there is one junction where it's surprisingly harder than the rest right? Was it Saryn?
[3:07:55] <hecadisth> Wait until Equinox
[3:07:56] <Solidus_113> sbfpWipeouts
[3:07:57] <LORDSPOOKLEKINS> You may as well be picking a different fucking class.
[3:08:00] <TezarroEX> if only you would look into the mods
[3:08:01] <+AXL808> Someone make a picture of fairy Pat harassing people and being to small for them to catch
[3:08:01] <+augurgewalt> The stat differences on some are extreme too
[3:08:02] <BaronVonWolfe> Wait until you get to Limbo
[3:08:03] <+preppyposs> GO DOWNSTAIRS
[3:08:06] <+SpookySpaghooti> NOW INSTALL IT

[3:09:09] <OfficialTimothy> Wow Ordis, so cool.
[3:09:11] <%MGKBurrito> lootboxes
[3:09:13] <+OblivionSword1> Ordis you're not helping
[3:09:14] <69nairra> @wookie5358 no they're like fossils with treasure inside
[3:09:16] <%MisterCrimson> lootboxes
[3:09:20] <%Jpdodds> lootbox
[3:09:25] <%Arnschen> @AngriestPat You do a quest and you a random item in that relic's list.
[3:09:25] <+VariantX7> schrodinger's lootboxes
[3:09:26] <Tuskor13> lol
[3:09:27] <sassyquatch963> it's a lootbox
[3:09:28] <cizal11> it's way simpler than it sounds
[3:09:29] <Zombrocom> Don't worry, that was mostly fluff
[3:09:30] <+augurgewalt> lootboxes
[3:09:32] <@thenefftw> It's a lootbox
[3:09:32] <%Jpdodds> Are donations off?
[3:09:34] <TheSpartanThief> Yeah, but that's Ordis
[3:09:36] <cizal11> LMFAO
[3:09:40] <bit_guardian> Ordis don't know how nothing works
[3:09:41] <El_Samio> Ordis doesn't know a lot of things
[3:09:41] <+Feltal> Free lootboxes
[3:09:44] <TezarroEX> yea nice, controller support
[3:09:44] <love_plays> It's a lootbox where you can actually see what the possible contents are and influence the chance of getting the good stuff.
[3:09:47] <OfficialTimothy> Just remember a Blue Stop Sign
[3:09:48] <xeros720> click the stupid things
[3:09:49] <puddingpants88> pat hasn't read any of them
[3:09:51] <Pistachiosss> That's what you get for playing with baby contoller
[3:09:54] <Slim_Lipid> Why is your spaceship so tsuntsun
[3:09:56] <cizal11> they aren't lootboxes so much as mission types with better rewards
[3:09:57] <tangoragahn> It's ingame lootboxes given out like candy
[3:10:02] <lord_souls> your still on solo
[3:10:03] <+augurgewalt> you crack the relic and get a forma or trash instead of what you want
[3:10:03] <+preppyposs> MARIANA IS ERF
[3:10:04] <El_Samio> get your ass to mars
[3:10:05] <TheSpartanThief> And it's NOT a lootbox. You DON'T pay for them...well, you can, but it's SUPER buried.
[3:10:07] <mrdazg> how much plat Pat already spent?
[3:10:07] <Tuskor13> This looks nothing like the warframe I played like 5 years ago

[3:16:35] <Varanoo> #RELIEF
[3:16:39] <+CaptainVore> food for your doggo
[3:16:40] <%TaifuDragon> endo
[3:16:40] <PerfectlyGenericUsername> WHEN' STALKER?!?!
[3:16:40] <+other_badger> @AngriestPat they're RE4 treaures
[3:16:43] <+SwdVengeance> Ya sell them for Endo, which is used to upgrade mods.
[3:16:43] <+preppyposs> THATS MAGNETS BABE
[3:16:43] <+augurgewalt> orokin garbage
[3:16:44] <Gorgen> you put them in statues to power them
[3:16:46] <Worldbrand> Very roundabout: they're used to upgrade mods
[3:16:46] <hecadisth> It's a thing you need for later to upgrade mods
[3:16:47] <@PlagueOfGripes> you put them in statues and trade them for a lot of endo
[3:16:47] <faegbeard> Used for another resource
[3:16:49] <+preppyposs> DONT SELL THEM
[3:16:49] <%commanderclaw> That was like having an itch in my brain scratched
[3:16:50] <%MGKBurrito> @AngriestPat it's a sourceendo
[3:16:51] <MrDrayko> Its honestly to hard to explain at this point
[3:16:52] <+Castlefronk> @AngriestPat They are your RE4 treasure system
[3:16:52] <BaronVonWolfe> They get you more endo
[3:16:52] <+Confused_4K> You put em in statues and sell em for endo
[3:16:52] <gunsrlove> @AngriestPat Ayatan stuff helps you level up mods
[3:16:53] <+preppyposs> DO NOT SELL THEM
[3:16:54] <TezarroEX> you'll know once you talk to maroo (best girl btw)
[3:16:54] <Solidus_113> sell them at Maroo's Bazaar for endo
[3:16:55] <bit_guardian> Endo for mod leveling
[3:16:56] <Cucamabungabu> Did Pat already buy all the frames with platinum?
[3:16:56] <cizal11> you them into ayatan sculptures and sell them to maroo for endo so you can upgrade your mods
[3:16:57] <+preppyposs> THEY ARE SO IMPORTANT
[3:16:58] <TheSpartanThief> They give you endo. Maroo will tell you more...once you meet her.
[3:17:05] <bit_guardian> Magnetic proc. Removes shields. Drains energy
[3:17:06] <Rogue657> You put them into Ayatan Statues that you can cash in for mod-upgrade moneys
[3:17:06] <tierney12> Achievements PogChamp
[3:17:07] <El_Samio> Ayatans are rare statues that give you a lot of mod-juice, or serve as decoration
[3:17:09] <Everpresent_Overseer> They are ship decorations or trade them in for juice to fuel your Mods
[3:17:13] <+preppyposs> DON'T SELL THEM
[3:17:13] <grayjammer> You'll understand after hte Maroo quest
[3:17:14] <bit_guardian> It's a trap on the Grineer doors
[3:17:15] <DeamonBound> @AngriestPat You put it in statues you find hidden in the map or you sell them for Endo better to save them for statues
[3:17:15] <EDFscout> Ayatan's are mods upgrade material
[3:17:15] <+preppyposs> DO NOT
[3:17:15] <+Phobaws06> no, dont sell them!
[3:17:16] <suspence15> security beams take your mana
[3:17:17] <+preppyposs> SELL THEM
[3:17:21] <lord_souls> you use them yo upgrade a statue that sells for a lot of mode upgrade points
[3:17:21] <TheImmortal70> When's the maroo quest?
[3:17:22] <N1netbattler> magnetic dmg steals energy
[3:17:24] <@thenefftw> @AngriestPat You can sell those for Endo which can upgrade your mods or put them in statues that give you a lot of Endo when completed
[3:17:24] <Varanoo> DO NOT SELL
[3:17:25] <+gozzojt27> you put them in the sortie reward you get EVER DAY
[3:17:26] <FATMANNUKE> @angriestpat you use the stars to increase the value of an item called an ayatan sculpture which essentially gives you xp to rank up mods called endo
[3:17:27] <MidKnight_24> More terms to learn, hooray!
[3:17:28] <faegbeard> HOW DOES HE READ ONLY THE UNHELPFUL LINES
[3:17:32] <+augurgewalt> security beams are the bane of my existence
[3:17:35] <Worldbrand> that's a good policy
[3:17:36] <69nairra> true
[3:17:37] <+Confused_4K> Honestly this game gets really boring if you pay to win
[3:17:38] <AzureSkyKnight> Is Pat still shitting his pant on Warframe?
[3:17:38] <+Phobaws06> cosmetic is good
[3:17:40] <faegbeard> This MUST be the work of an enemy stand.
[3:17:40] <Gorgen> yes
[3:17:40] <sassyquatch963> yes it is
[3:17:40] <LORDSPOOKLEKINS> That's correct
[3:17:40] <+HelloImTom08> more skins D:
[3:17:42] <+WeeabooHotdog> SAVE FOR SLOTS!!
[3:17:42] <OfficialTimothy> You would be right
[3:17:43] <fattness132> dont forget slots
[3:17:43] <TwentyCXII> SLOTS tho
[3:17:44] <Cucamabungabu> Slots are a good idea aswell
[3:17:44] <BaronVonWolfe> Pretty much
[3:17:44] <+augurgewalt> and slots
[3:17:45] <sunriser696> slots
[3:17:46] <OfficialTimothy> ALSO RIGHT
[3:17:46] <Noponiz> AND SLOTS
[3:17:47] <%InkblotBlues> Use Platinum on slots first, then cosmetics.
[3:17:48] <sassyquatch963> DAMN RIGHT
[3:17:49] <+itsOnyxLeo> Yup, slots
[3:17:49] <sunriser696> slots are the best
[3:17:49] <Everpresent_Overseer> Pat knows how to use Plat wisely
[3:17:50] <chiglit> ENDGAME ACHIEVED
[3:17:51] <+Confused_4K> HOT SLOTS
[3:17:52] <cizal11> yes that is by far the best use
[3:17:52] <+itsOnyxLeo> He's learning!
[3:17:53] <+other_badger> CORRECT
[3:17:54] <Volkrotia> Now we got him bois
[3:17:54] <+OblivionSword1> That's the idea
[3:17:55] <Cucamabungabu> someone did his homework
[3:17:56] <sassyquatch963> CORRECT
[3:17:56] <+captain_elsewhere> and orokin catalysts
[3:17:57] <TezarroEX> collect all the warframes
[3:18:00] <sassyquatch963> YOU ARE RIGHT
[3:18:00] <+M4T1A5> i have spent so much on cosmetics
[3:18:00] <Volkrotia> Pat gets Warfame
[3:18:01] <NoirePanzer> FASHION FRAME IS THE END GAME
[3:18:03] <Ethatre> smart boy
[3:18:03] <BaronVonWolfe> Fashionframe is endgame
[3:18:04] <+OranHexthief> by the way guys if you are on PC and see those little icons under the stream that let you buy plat and stuff you can buy those and give pat get some of the money just so you know @AngriestPat
[3:18:05] <Bncbck> ONLY COSMETICS
[3:18:05] <+HelloImTom08> also blue potatoes
[3:18:05] <Caidezes> Buying anything that isn't cosmetic or inventory slots with platinum is a waste.
[3:18:06] <+gozzojt27> RIven slots amiright guys?
[3:18:08] <69nairra> once you buy all the skins you get the secret endgame
[3:18:09] <Peashooter117> Yeah like it’s hilarious that he only ends up reading the unhelpful ones
[3:18:09] <bit_guardian> Slots too. Though you do get three free slots a year on the anniversary.
[3:18:11] <Cobra743> Perfact
[3:18:11] <sunriser696> buying frames and weapows just defeat the whole point
[3:18:11] <hecadisth> He's learning
[3:18:14] <Cucamabungabu> @AngriestPat You better fashion frame my man
[3:18:15] <%Ablestron> @AngriestPat theyre a piece of a sculpture you put together over the course of the game from drops. save them for when you complete a full set and you can trade it in for Endo; the resource for upgrading your mods
[3:18:17] <TezarroEX> oof
[3:18:19] <+AXL808> The vast majority of warframes are actually simple to obtain, some of them are tedious but many are straightforward
[3:18:20] <Volkrotia> Second Dream here we come
[3:18:20] <+augurgewalt> not like the mk1s are worth keeping though
[3:18:23] <+Confused_4K> Exidus adapters are also needed later
[3:18:24] <bit_guardian> "SUP SHITBIRDS"
[3:18:26] <suspence15> I am so happy that he is already getting into the color and fashion side of this game
[3:18:27] <+Ciphris> i think there's enough cosmetics in the game to do away with slots imho
[3:18:31] <BaronVonWolfe> It would help if you had the right mods, huh, PAT!
[3:18:35] <Giothegame> Oh cool Warframe stream
[3:18:39] <mrdazg> is Woolie playing Wraframe too?
[3:18:44] <tierney12> has Pat tried conclave yet? Kappa
[3:18:46] <+Ciphris> no slots kills new player experienec pretty hard
[3:18:48] <+Commander_Cruz> that feeling when u learn u cant transfer your psn progress to pc TableHere FlipThis
[3:18:48] <DeamonBound> @AngriestPat some color pallets become free at certain dates, like Halloween and valentines day and so on
[3:18:51] <+Phobaws06> does pat know captura yet?
[3:18:55] <%Ablestron> @AngriestPat theyre a piece of a sculpture you put together over the course of the game from drops. save them for when you complete a full set and you can trade it in for Endo; the resource for upgrading your mods
[3:18:55] <+HelloImTom08> destiny LUL
[3:18:56] <hecadisth> oh boy
[3:18:58] <TezarroEX> woolie is never gonna play warframe

[3:19:05] <Caidezes> This is gonna be juicy.
[3:19:10] <TheImmortal70> @angriestpat Boy you were WRONG
[3:19:11] <+augurgewalt> and they were right

[3:19:49] <%Ablestron> THE TRUTH
[3:19:49] <+SpookySpaghooti> I fucking bought Destiny 2 and the season pass, im so angry
[3:19:50] <Worldbrand> He knows
[3:19:51] <cizal11> some planets share tilesets
[3:19:54] <+Punchasaur> AND IT DOESNT SUCK
[3:19:55] <TwentyCXII> Destiny 1 was good ;___;
[3:19:55] <+Phobaws06> SO. MUCH. SHIT.
[3:19:55] <Caidezes> And it's free.
[3:19:55] <+xXichibanballer> I',m sure most of us felt the same before we actually played warframe
[3:19:56] <cizal11> but there's still more variety
[3:19:57] <Giothegame> Did Pat see the Yakuza Kiwami 2 news?
[3:19:57] <bleugh> welcome to the ricefields mofuka
[3:20:00] <Glassbrain> Mighty Jumpy Play-doh Ninjas
[3:20:01] <+unfoldingchoas> yeah spend that destiny money on warframe really
[3:20:01] <TezarroEX> you haven't even seen the void shit
[3:20:02] <%MisterCrimson> Man, D2 was such a disappointment
[3:20:02] <+augurgewalt> Destiny 1 was a trend setter for a trend that didnt take off
[3:20:02] <Giothegame> Coming out August 28th
[3:20:02] <hecadisth> Mission succ
[3:20:05] <%Ablestron> THAT A FREE TO PLAY GAME DOES MORE THAN FUCKING AAA

[3:20:11] <+bkb12j> ITS FREE

[3:20:13] <sangi53> doesn't matter, you bought both games lol
[3:20:17] <+M4T1A5> and this is only the beginning of warframe
[3:20:18] <TheSpartanThief> And pat has capped meridian
[3:20:19] <TheImmortal70> @ablestron A free to play that has done this for yeas
[3:20:19] <%MGKBurrito> @AngriestPat and the devs are planning on expanding past the solar system
[3:20:20] <Tactical_Hotdog> @AngriestPat I like shooters, but not into third person really, is Warframe worth a shot, seeing as it's free after all?
[3:20:20] <sassyquatch963> now say good things about t on the podcast
[3:20:21] <viewtifulr> oh theres news?

[3:20:42] <El_Samio> broltor
[3:20:42] <wookie5358> It's easy to form immediate judgement on free games nowadays, with how many are terrible. I went the longest time avoiding Warframe as well because of other free games jading me
[3:20:43] <cizal11> boltor is pretty ok
[3:20:44] <PhantaniumOG> boltor is super cool
[3:20:45] <+other_badger> B O L T O R B O Y S
[3:20:45] <TheImmortal70> Boltor is apparently great too
[3:20:45] <+Kaneis> I still am infatuated with Destiny 2's gunplay and worldbuilding; the devs really squandered its potential
[3:20:46] <Gorgen> boltor is great for killing grineer
[3:20:46] <hecadisth> Boltor¡s gud

[3:21:02] <Riki_Mau> boltor style weapons are nice and chunky
[3:21:02] <Worldbrand> Eventually finish ranking the mk-1 braton/paris so that you can sell them

[3:21:10] <+Ciphris> friendship ended with boltor, now telos boltor is my best friend
[3:21:12] <+CapnCarnivore> @AngriestPat Boltor is fucken stronk and Boltor Prime is something you should go for first for primes
[3:21:12] <fruit_pie_the_magician> pin bitches to walls
[3:21:12] <+AXL808> Have you picked a Syndicate yet?
[3:21:13] <Gorgen> Orokin tileset inc
[3:21:13] <+NiktenKing> BOLTOR IS SICK
[3:21:14] <+CaptainVore> no its not LUL
[3:21:14] <MajesticSundew> Telos Boltor is top tier
[3:21:15] <@PlagueOfGripes> Hek and Lex. get them
[3:21:15] <+other_badger> PUNCHTHROUGH Kappa
[3:21:15] <El_Samio> Boltor's not as good anymore
[3:21:15] <OfficialTimothy> Best guns? Maybe 4 years ago
[3:21:16] <LORDSPOOKLEKINS> *** were close now.
[3:21:16] <%InkblotBlues> Boltor Prime is also damn good.
[3:21:19] <Tactical_Hotdog> @bit_guardian the Hell is amera?
[3:21:19] <+AcidicHorizon> KING OF STRONG STYLE
[3:21:20] <CertainlySyrix> It's not one of the best anymore. @AngriestPat but it used to be top dog
[3:21:21] <Rogue657> @MajesticSundew by no means lol
[3:21:21] <MidKnight_24> Be careful leveling low level weapons in higher level areas, you should be fine now though
[3:21:22] <+Phobaws06> not the best, but is a good starter gun
[3:21:23] <lord_souls> its starting min game gun
[3:21:23] <+xXichibanballer> Octavia's Boltor skin is dope af, because it has a custom reload animation where she strums it like a guitar
[3:21:24] <sunriser696> boltor is pretty good but noltor was better
[3:21:25] <+unfoldingchoas> @plagueofgripes Hek with its mod is great
[3:21:25] <Cucamabungabu> @AngriestPat Will you do a Warframe stream or video with Plague?
[3:21:25] <+SpookySpaghooti> @AXL808 he cant do syndicates until MR5 I believe
[3:21:25] <+augurgewalt> And then EA decided to have Bioware make a destiny clone...
[3:21:25] <69nairra> people who say boltor isnt good = dumb dumbs
[3:21:25] <mrdazg> doing the archwing with Titania Kappa
[3:21:26] <bit_guardian> PRAISE THE STUGG
[3:21:28] <+gozzojt27> LEX BEST GUN

[3:21:36] <%Ablestron> @TheImmortal70 I mean yea, but they are a dev team of like 190 ppl, with no producers giving them moneys. Destiny 2 has a dev team of like 500 people, with hundreds of millions in production costs
[3:21:38] <+augurgewalt> Boltor is good and fun, but not the best
[3:21:40] <MajesticSundew> @Rogue657 Telos Boltor is honestly a great crit gun
[3:21:44] <grayjammer> Boltor is good if ya wanna NAIL SHIT TA WALLZ FUCK YEAHH
[3:21:45] <+augurgewalt> Nailing people to the wall though
[3:21:45] <@PlagueOfGripes> oh god he ended up in the orokin area
[3:21:46] <+SpookySpaghooti> wait when did he get Boltor? did I space out for a second?
[3:21:47] <Twoiis> Nail gun
[3:21:51] <TezarroEX> its shooting needles
[3:21:52] <+gozzojt27> oh no...
[3:21:54] <TheImmortal70> @plagueofgripes so plague, I'm using the Sybaris for now, but what would you say is a great automatic gun with high rate of fire?
[3:21:54] <Rivalshotzgp> Remember the Corinth shotgun gif on the sub? That’s a good gun
[3:21:55] <Valtyrae> It basically shoots nails that impales people to walls.
[3:21:56] <+NiktenKing> You can impale enemies

[3:22:21] <+Confused_4K> NO MODS NO DAMAGE
[3:22:22] <+Castlefronk> @AngriestPat The caches are optional things you can look around the tiles for, in general not worth it.
[3:22:22] <+OranHexthief> no mods
[3:22:23] <Feathy> MODS
[3:22:23] <+OblivionSword1> It's just side objective
[3:22:24] <hecadisth> Boltor proyectiles have travel time btw
[3:22:24] <+CapnCarnivore> you AINT GOT NO MODS SON
[3:22:24] <thelonechris> Why no damage as the enemy dies
[3:22:25] <OceanGovernor> no mods = no damage
[3:22:25] <faegbeard> No mods = no damage
[3:22:26] <+ccwettr123> @AngriestPat no damage bc no mods
[3:22:26] <+other_badger> mods = damage
[3:22:26] <GoldeNOVA> @AngriestPat You didn't equip mods
[3:22:26] <prismaticsnake> extra loots lockers that show up white instead of green
[3:22:27] <@PlagueOfGripes> @TheImmortal70 Soma Prime?
[3:22:27] <TheImmortal70> @angriestpat you forgot the fuckin mods
[3:22:27] <BaronVonWolfe> Extra stuff youcan find.Look for caches with white lights
[3:22:28] <Rogue657> @MajesticSundew 30% crit lets it be okay, but it's by no means top tier
[3:22:28] <%Ele_On_A_Uni> they're hidden goodies, listen for a musical chime
[3:22:29] <Valtyrae> Caches are a side-thing but you get more rewards if you find them.
[3:22:29] <+unfoldingchoas> did you mod the weapon
[3:22:29] <Cucamabungabu> @AngriestPat Will you do a Warframe stream or video with Plague?
[3:22:30] <bit_guardian> No mods. Not even an auto mod
[3:22:31] <@thenefftw> @AngriestPat Optional, but you can get cool shit for opening them
[3:22:31] <grayjammer> Bad damage type vs robots
[3:22:31] <%InkblotBlues> @AngriestPat Orokin Caches are an optional objective that grants rewards. Look for large out of place white boxes.
[3:22:32] <TezarroEX> no mods, no dmg
[3:22:34] <%MGKBurrito> you fucking fool
[3:22:34] <+VariantX7> Becauz U NO MOD Pat
[3:22:35] <%Ablestron> @AngriestPat caches are seperate but give good rewards, open containers to find them
[3:22:35] <+TheSaintJohn> You need to mod your weapons for maximum potential pat
[3:22:36] <+AcidicHorizon> mods = dmg
[3:22:36] <TyrantBelial> Cus you forgot to mod it.
[3:22:37] <+Phobaws06> special containers, they make a sound when u get near
[3:22:37] <TheImmortal70> @PlagueOfGripes Alright!
[3:22:38] <+Doctor_Scoots> Pat comes to void, but he is merely a tresspasser
[3:22:40] <fruit_pie_the_magician> NO MODS
[3:22:43] <+unfoldingchoas> no mods on weapon
[3:22:43] <Valtyrae> No damage because it's a level 0 weapon and this is a level 10 mission.
[3:22:45] <MidKnight_24> Your Boltor is level is 0 and enemy level is 10
[3:22:45] <+NiktenKing> No damage cause you don't have ranks in Boltor... and Orokin Void stuff is like... tougher
[3:22:46] <+AXL808> Rank 1, that's why no damage
[3:22:49] <El_Samio> he has no Loot Detector / Animal Instinct, so good luck finding the caches
[3:22:49] <Varanoo> mods = dmg
[3:22:49] <@thenefftw> No mods
[3:22:50] <lord_souls> yes
[3:22:50] <+CapnCarnivore> @AngriestPat they can have good shit in them tho
[3:22:52] <+fireking900> I got like 1 and i couldnt fine the other two
[3:22:53] <sunriser696> you not gonna find them pat, dont try
[3:22:55] <aeonicvector> its cover that forms when you get lose
[3:22:58] <+NiktenKing> Yes
[3:22:58] <alpharius88> you forgoth to put mod in you boltor....
[3:22:59] <bit_guardian> Yes
[3:23:00] <+hypethefool> help this man
[3:23:00] <TyrantBelial> Mods are required for damage
[3:23:01] <+augurgewalt> find the obstacle course in the orokin levels for rare mods though
[3:23:01] <%Ablestron> @AngriestPat you need to level up your damage mods pat
[3:23:02] <faegbeard> "robots"
[3:23:02] <Varanoo> yes
[3:23:03] <Forshino> Dex Sybaris is one of the best guns in the game, so it's going to be a little disappointing going back to the starting weapons
[3:23:03] <sassyquatch963> THOSE AINT ROBOTS
[3:23:03] <Gorgen> it's a grineer
[3:23:04] <+gozzojt27> das notta robo tho
[3:23:05] <+KhazperGaming> you HAVE to get them Pat. you have to or you are a failure.
[3:23:05] <+CapnCarnivore> Same damage type, tho LOL
[3:23:07] <El_Samio> Boltor does Puncture, which does more damage to Armor
[3:23:07] <NoirePanzer> This man needs a guide
[3:23:09] <+Confused_4K> It's a block your bullet jump spot
[3:23:10] <TyrantBelial> Unlike monster hunter where you don't need any attack gems
[3:23:11] <hecadisth> Well your Boltor has no mods on
[3:23:13] <%Ele_On_A_Uni> robots :V
[3:23:14] <69nairra> D:
[3:23:15] <Everpresent_Overseer> those are people possesed by robots
[3:23:16] <Worldbrand> oh BOY when plague gets to explain damage types and armor
[3:23:16] <cizal11> pat it has no mods
[3:23:18] <+unfoldingchoas> i dont ghink he mod the weapon
[3:23:19] <Varanoo> AcidicHorizon: mods = dmg
[3:23:19] <cizal11> why would it have damage
[3:23:20] <GiantRobort> your boltor is fine you just need to level it and mod it
[3:23:20] <bit_guardian> But it's fun to watch him learn
[3:23:20] <+TheSwinns> Each weapon rank + 1 more mod point for a gun, lower rank = lower mods = less damage
[3:23:20] <TezarroEX> those are basically the taken, pat
[3:23:21] <suspence15> It is just there to pop out of the ground and ruin you bullet jumps
[3:23:21] <aeonicvector> So slight lore, these arent robots, these are mind controlled, Borg'd people
[3:23:22] <%Ablestron> @AngriestPat you didnt put any mods in it.
[3:23:24] <%Ablestron> rip
[3:23:24] <TheSpartanThief> Well, Pat, maybe if you isntalled SOME MODS......
[3:23:25] <%InkblotBlues> @AngriestPat Not the gun's fault, you just need some damage mods on it.
[3:23:26] <Cucamabungabu> @AngriestPat Will you do a Warframe stream or video with Plague?
[3:23:26] <+TeethMuncher> @AngriestPat you need to mod it
[3:23:27] <Varanoo> mods = dmg
[3:23:28] <Gorgen> Grineer are clones
[3:23:30] <BaronVonWolfe> Well maybe if you PUT SOME FUCKING MODS ON IT!
[3:23:30] <+CaptainVore> hes like mr 3, its not like he could put many mods on it anyways
[3:23:34] <SmithersDotTV> how is he doing that glide
[3:23:34] <+ryujinran> i think boltor is actually supposed to be good against yellow health
[3:23:35] <+AXL808> well there are corpus drones here too
[3:23:35] <PhantaniumOG> Mods are all your damage
[3:23:35] <KatabolicRage> guns without mods in them are always garbage
[3:23:37] <thelonechris> Big white ting
[3:23:38] <Rogue657> he literally can't put mods on it that matter yet
[3:23:40] <Xanax44> @AngriestPat protip, headshots are very important versus those heavy gunners
[3:23:40] <T_Sasquatch> there are damage types ? LUL i just kill
[3:23:41] <Peashooter117> Pat: doesn’t mod his weapon and then asks why he do no damage. Love ya you little shit gremlin Kappa
[3:23:41] <GoldeNOVA> mods = progression
[3:23:44] <fruit_pie_the_magician> Pat not using mods is like not using charms in monster hunter
[3:23:46] <+ccwettr123> @PlagueOfGripes please make pat not bad at this game
[3:23:46] <+Ciphris> fancy void tree
[3:23:50] <arfsm95> @AngriestPat hey i have a trinity prime for you, if you want it
[3:23:51] <@thenefftw> @AngriestPat You haven't put any mods into Boltor, so it won't be as good
[3:23:52] <+SpookySpaghooti> @ryujinran Boltor does puncture mainly so it lowers enemy damage
[3:23:53] <%Ablestron> @AngriestPat so this is an orokin map. as you can see, they were quite decadent
[3:23:53] <+CapnCarnivore> @AngriestPat your furis and boltor do the same damage type, it's just that you forgot to mod your boltor ya dingus
[3:23:54] <+captain_elsewhere> btw yes all that gold shit is gold, orokins were pimp assholes
[3:23:54] <CertainlySyrix> He could probably start upgrading some important ones now, would help a little
[3:23:56] <%Mrdoctorprofessorhipster> Goodbye everyone
[3:23:57] <+Confused_4K> You cant get void mods on this mission right?
[3:23:57] <+M4T1A5> the killshot needs to be a headshot
[3:23:58] <MajesticSundew> @Rogue657 It has almost Soma Prime tier crit stats and it has more than double the base damage
[3:23:59] <+augurgewalt> tigris prime does not care for damage types, it just kills
[3:23:59] <AzureSkyKnight> @AngriestPat It has no mods and is lvl nothing vs corrupted enemies, dont talk shit on the Boltor
[3:24:03] <TezarroEX> there are very much dmg types like the pokemons
[3:24:04] <KatabolicRage> it's more like not using mods is like never upgrading your weapon in MH
[3:24:06] <%MisterCrimson> Nanomachines, Son
[3:24:07] <El_Samio> Corrupted = Orokin Borg
[3:24:08] <cizal11> because this is the void
[3:24:08] <+gozzojt27> LORE
[3:24:08] <bit_guardian> @Mrdoctorprofessorhipster Goodbye
[3:24:10] <NekoFAIA> they're morally bankrupt
[3:24:10] <+Phobaws06> by the void
[3:24:16] <mrdazg> because of the Neural sentry
[3:24:16] <+xXichibanballer> ITS A KURUPTION TING
[3:24:17] <El_Samio> THE BASS CANNONS
[3:24:20] <+unfoldingchoas> he could updrade vitalit mod
[3:24:21] <+augurgewalt> void magic lasers
[3:24:22] <booterdagg> they watched serbian film and got all corrupt
[3:24:23] <Bncbck> the orokin ahegao invaders into being their sex slaves
[3:24:25] <aeonicvector> @AngriestPat the void corrupts things, like the Borg but also a building
[3:24:25] <+DarkShadow124> MMo lite?
[3:24:28] <TheImmortal70> MMO gungame with loot hording
[3:24:31] <69nairra> destiny but better LUL
[3:24:32] <TyrantBelial> @AngriestPat Pat the difference between an unmodded weapon and a fully modded weapon is not 1 and 10, it's 1 and 1 billion. Just so you know.
[3:24:33] <TheImmortal70> And a global economy
[3:24:33] <hecadisth> Your voltorb has no mods patrick
[3:24:33] <+CapnCarnivore> @AngriestPat furis and boltor do the same damage type, it's just that you forgot to mod your boltor ya dingus
[3:24:38] <bit_guardian> Now you know how @PlagueOfGripes felt on the podcast
[3:24:39] <arfsm95> @AngriestPat hey i have a trinity prime for you, if you want it
[3:24:40] <Gorgen> Orokin stuff converts trespassers
[3:24:41] <GoldeNOVA> Online TPS
[3:24:41] <TezarroEX> its a nice milkshake
[3:24:42] <+JoeStillLife> Dark Soulsy Kappa
[3:24:45] <%Remery_> what destiny should have been
[3:24:47] <ThissisAwesome> Is it actually generated?
[3:24:51] <+augurgewalt> The orokin had an infinite energy source and used it for decoration instead of something useful
[3:24:53] <%MGKBurrito> yes
[3:24:54] <FATMANNUKE> its not procedurally generated its randomized tilesets... who lied?
[3:24:55] <El_Samio> Yes, ThisisAwesome
[3:24:55] <C_game_me_811> destiny but better doodGood doodGood
[3:24:56] <+NiktenKing> And the devs aren't shit
[3:24:56] <+D4C_Trice> Reminds me of ME3 multiplayer
[3:24:57] <+Confused_4K> It's super unique
[3:25:00] <Everpresent_Overseer> Being on an Orokin tower the defense system of the tower literally possess you
[3:25:03] <suikudo> Its like darksouls with ninja's
[3:25:04] <TheImmortal70> @arfsm95 He appreciates the sentiment, but he generally wants to get stuff for himself
[3:25:07] <KatabolicRage> doing good damage in warframe is all about learning enemy weaknesses and modding your weapons to take advantage of it, and any innate status or crit the weapon has
[3:25:08] <SweetCheeksTrap> Hello there @Milk_Mind
[3:25:09] <MidKnight_24> And that's why I have to separate planetary progression and personal progression, to balance using new stuff and using good stuff
[3:25:10] <Cucamabungabu> @AngriestPat Will you do a Warframe stream or video with Plague?
[3:25:12] <T_Sasquatch> the lack of races more than 4 races bothers me
[3:25:13] <+SpookySpaghooti> thats not a robot lol
[3:25:15] <%Ablestron> @AngriestPat every enemy in the void has been "corrupted" by an evil robot called the orokin sensor that corrupts different units to help it defend the orokin ruins from trespassers
[3:25:15] <C_game_me_811> @milk_mind Hello

[3:25:49] <KaiserMario> Is it werid that the Frame is the robot killing people?
[3:25:49] <arfsm95> @AngriestPat the corruption is LITERALLY a bio curse
[3:25:53] <Giothegame> It's been a looooong time since I've played Warframe. That's a pretty interesting ability this warframe has.
[3:25:57] <+gozzojt27> 4 yrs, that ragdoll never gets old
[3:25:57] <+captain_elsewhere> oh crap
[3:25:58] <+AXL808> Does Pat know he can go straight up and down in Titania's ult?
[3:26:00] <cizal11> missed both good boxes in that room oh well
[3:26:04] <+other_badger> everything about the boltor just feels nice
[3:26:06] <+augurgewalt> like every creature in the game is some orokin experiment freak accident
[3:26:06] <LORDSPOOKLEKINS> @arfsm95 Oh god you aren't even fucking wrong
[3:26:10] <+Confused_4K> This is my favorite tile set i think

[3:26:29] <Varanoo> everything
[3:26:29] <MrDrayko> prioritizes the thing the quest is set to but its spreads
[3:26:30] <Xanax44> @AngriestPat Dunno if anyone has told you, but there IS an endgame raid in this game
[3:26:30] <El_Samio> Woolie gets Valkyr
[3:26:31] <TezarroEX> with what you have equipped
[3:26:32] <+Punchasaur> hmmmmmmm
[3:26:33] <mcevers> man needs a serration mod

[3:26:33] <Megabulldog> Is this on pc?
[3:26:34] <DaVillain47> It's split among what y9uo brought.
[3:26:34] <+Confused_4K> Perfect run RUINED

[3:37:15] <Goldteddy> unfortunately the early game of Warframe is alot of grinding for stuff to craft the cool stuff
[3:37:19] <HorribleHog> You can do the ting!
[3:37:28] <TheSpartanThief> Pat, if you need spare useful mods, be sure to message me ingame. SpartanXIII, you don't have to pay plat.

[3:38:25] <+AXL808> awesome!
[3:38:26] <+TheSaintJohn> Eh the wiki is generally kept up to date
[3:38:27] <Twoiis> Hey guise where are my void keys?
[3:38:31] <+AcidicHorizon> WEEKLY UPDATES
[3:38:32] <Worldbrand> If anyone wants to make a reddit thread asking warframe specific questions, i'll sit down and answer whatever. I've got a few thousand hours in.
[3:38:33] <+augurgewalt> the wiki is always up to date
[3:38:33] <+NiktenKing> The wiki is too up to date
[3:38:34] <Jahona_Mona> @AngriestPat Just tuned in. You liking it so far?
[3:38:37] <suspence15> They have to stop making new stuff and improve old stuff. only real problem
[3:38:42] <tangoragahn> 1 million mechanics is underselling it
[3:38:42] <Goldteddy> i suggest you just spent some time on the Warframe wiki, ALOT less intense than trying to find useful stuff in the chat

[3:40:11] <El_Samio> but sometimes you get 75% discount
[3:40:11] <+MultipleJiggs> of COURSE Pat likes Warframe.
[3:40:12] <+KhazperGaming> just wait for -75% off plat
[3:40:13] <Goldteddy> considering how much trading there is in the game, its no wonder you're confused
[3:40:14] <+mechokk> the daily login is always like a coupon for plat
[3:40:15] <DaVillain47> 370 is 10 US dollars
[3:40:16] <%TaifuDragon> !rafe
[3:40:17] <tangoragahn> 10 is a dollar iirc
[3:40:21] <+Phobaws06> wait for discounts
[3:40:23] <KatabolicRage> people tend to just wait for a discount daily login reward
[3:40:24] <+AXL808> A discount will probably come soon enough
[3:40:24] <hohokuma> !raffle
[3:40:25] <+ThermalShrub> Did Pat check out any of the mini games?
[3:40:28] <%acktuallyron> Hey dats me
[3:40:31] <Worldbrand> Plat on PC should only be calculated with the 75% discount plus bonuses
[3:40:31] <Twoiis> Waiting on that 75% fer years
[3:40:38] <booterdagg> OhMyDog
[3:40:39] <bleugh> how many bitcoin is that
[3:40:41] <UmphressR> THE HYPEST PAT
[3:40:43] <CertainlySyrix> @AngriestPat platinum amounts don't really translate to exact currency I'd say. since you can get a lot by trading very fast. I wouldn't say a mod that costs like, 170 plat is worth ten bucks
[3:40:45] <%Remery_> .....
[3:40:47] <+gozzojt27> hehe
[3:40:47] <wookie5358> You can trade plat with other players in game, can't you?
