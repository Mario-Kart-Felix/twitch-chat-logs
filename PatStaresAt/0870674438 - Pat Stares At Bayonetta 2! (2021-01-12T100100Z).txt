[0:14:47] <+Mexiflan> i would know
[0:14:49] <jessicaaquin0> its not the same without chat ;__;
[0:14:52] <%cervidaequus> But FOMO
[0:14:52] <DianaTheAscian> @PatStaresAt NO OLD MAN
[0:14:52] <%Dakuu75> I like the vods but, I rather be here live.
[0:14:54] <Djinnazz> yyou coulda stopped there.
[0:14:55] <%chiazam> IF ITS NOT LIVE WITH CHAT DOES IT EVEN COUNT
[0:14:57] <sharksdanger> Pat at 10am my local time. loving life
[0:14:58] <%jnoble919> The VODs save come in clutch when we're in the middle of the ocean
[0:15:01] <roof_pizza84> No pretend. Only live meme
[0:15:02] <dariusclover> can't do that
[0:15:05] <ricky12k1> Pat you don’t do these everyday most of the time you do them when you feel like it which is fine
[0:15:05] <@SoFarFetched> people wanna see you shit your pants live
[0:15:08] <@SoFarFetched> so they can say they wre there for it
[0:15:10] <SonicD4> i didn't realize the vods were public

[0:15:28] <%dasmause> @PatStaresAt if you had to apply for a streaming job, youd fail that interview
[0:15:28] <%SaiyanShoto> When you stream there’s hardly any boring part
[0:15:31] <%LiveStreamOnyx> If we just watch VODs then why even stream live? lorSIP

[0:15:53] <For_Temeria> If I'm watching a VOD I feel like I need to focus on it, a stream can be background noise I can half listen to
[0:15:56] <ricky12k1> Memes is life
[0:16:03] <youngking_kush> Depends on the game
[0:16:03] <DianaTheAscian> @PatStaresAt your whole stream is the meme

[0:45:45] <%theaggressivetoast> SNEK
[0:46:00] <%Dakuu75> @PatStaresAt do you use metric or imperial system in Canada?
[0:46:00] <huskarl_zap> Cearnobog doesnt do feet tho
[0:46:03] <Geno4344> I want Raiden to fight Bayonetta just so he can rag on her use of weaponry like he did Sundowner's scissors

[0:46:53] <+TheNoidBag> @Dakuu75 Canada uses Metric except for like, height, or the odd person using Fahrenheit.
[0:46:57] <%CherteuseKapibara> ..... why is pat streaming at 5:47 am ....
[0:46:58] <huskarl_zap> Alf was better

[0:47:34] <SaltyAzteca> GOLD?? DansGame
[0:47:48] <beatie_g> woah it's pretty late/early
[0:47:57] <+OwlLightningMage> This game has a fucked up ranking system
[0:47:57] <+Over_ninek> lol
[0:48:00] <Vermilingus> Gotta love forced walk sections
[0:48:12] <huskarl_zap> Stone > Gold Kappa
[0:48:13] <Wan6Saber> sexy walk jennGasm
[0:48:14] <Grandma_Amari> Bayo's strut is so great.
[0:48:20] <%Daniel_Is_I> The way she walks with those giant fucking gun-boots LUL
[0:48:27] <DianaTheAscian> no
[0:48:27] <+OwlLightningMage> Bayo is super lying
[0:48:37] <king__theseus> What’s up gang
[0:48:42] <%Dakuu75> ok... she was refering to her amnesia but, it sounded like she called herself stupid
[0:48:47] <beefomkers> cool voice acting
[0:48:50] <beatie_g> 4Head
[0:48:50] <huskarl_zap> Exposition walk GoW
[0:48:55] <+amiroodude> what is the plot of this game?
[0:49:00] <+Over_ninek> just believe and KILL GOD
[0:49:03] <+OwlLightningMage> yes
[0:49:08] <beefomkers> you have to stop and listen
[0:49:11] <beefomkers> it's
[0:49:14] <beefomkers> so important
[0:49:19] <Hanyusha> that strut kills the scene tbh
[0:49:25] <+OwlLightningMage> The plot is an attempt to explain the plot of the first game
[0:49:28] <0rond> i think it makes enemies rop more halos?
[0:49:29] <%Dakuu75> plot of this game is the same as the first "Attack and dethrone god" but, witht he added twist of "save your friend"
[0:49:31] <+Over_ninek> Bayo found this this amnesia kid and he reminds her of herself so she's being big softy
[0:49:33] <+thecosmicfly> Less lore, more attacking and dethroning God
[0:49:53] <%GarbageNirvana> You know items don't detract from your score in this one right Pat
[0:50:01] <PanicSwytch> The Plot is How to fix Bay 1 by making it more confusing.
[0:50:08] <+amiroodude> ah I see Japanese rpg plot
[0:50:09] <beefomkers> Why do all japanese games end with you killing god
[0:50:13] <Geno4344> I don't even remember the deal of the bad guy of bayo 2
[0:50:17] <0rond> does the bell actually kill things or is it a buffs for how much halos you get?
[0:50:18] <+OwlLightningMage> The plot of Bayo 3 also seems to be time travel or some shit LUL
[0:50:20] <+cravsa> has Pat been awake all night or just woke up early
[0:50:21] <+Gespens> Wow, 5 hours
[0:50:23] <huskarl_zap> Alfheim > Muspheim
[0:50:30] <%Mendin> So I haven't been paying attention, where are we on the plot arc of "save friend from double hell" to "attack and dethrone god"
[0:50:33] <Grandma_Amari> Wow so hard Kappa
[0:50:34] <+azure_dekuman> that was fast.
[0:50:42] <beefomkers> Time travel so she can go back in time and kill god again
[0:50:52] <Ner234> @OwlLightningMage Wait hold on we know things about Bayo 3's plot?
[0:50:55] <ashworfi> hey pat thanks for the late night kiwiland content
[0:51:01] <PanicSwytch> I hope Bay 3 plot make absolutely no sense
[0:51:05] <0rond> only that one teaser from the reveal
[0:51:12] <beefomkers> I think killing god is probably as high as you can get in the power rankings
[0:51:21] <+OwlLightningMage> The one trailer MAYBE? Had time travel again
[0:51:22] <%Dakuu75> WHAT HAPPNED TO HIS FACE?!
[0:51:26] <beefomkers> Nowhere really to go

[0:52:59] <+OwlLightningMage> My MIND
[0:53:03] <%GarbageNirvana> Ain't that a Norse mythology thing
[0:53:05] <%Mendin> Oh no he's having an Echo attack
[0:53:14] <beefomkers> It's just his voice over and over in sometimes slightly different accents
[0:53:16] <huskarl_zap> OH NO TOO HUMAN
[0:53:23] <%Chichen> oh no they're trying to summon Zodiark
[0:53:29] <+Over_ninek> OBVIOUSLY

[0:54:53] <Grandma_Amari> So they woke up to justice?

[0:57:13] <%Declan_8000> Pat should of trolled and called it Bayo 3 for the stream
[0:57:16] <beefomkers> and also a reason not to shove screwdrivers in my ears

[0:58:39] <huskarl_zap> But you cant play the lumen sage wow
[0:58:46] <SoftLusca> Kinetic card
[0:58:52] <Spudnacious_Dynasty> I almost hope Bayo 3 doesn't have a story.
[0:58:54] <+xtian9811> Yes early morning pat stream
[0:58:57] <KinduVborrd> Yes, minigames in Bayonetta are verses
[0:58:58] <swift_malachi> Pat, it's 5 in the morning. Why on earth are you making chocolate pudding
[0:58:59] <+Over_ninek> ACTION
[0:59:04] <+OwlLightningMage> Playing as Rodin is super disappointing
[0:59:10] <%Engwithan_Elder_God> Engwithan_Elder_God subscribed at Tier 1. They've subscribed for 25 months, currently on a 25 month streak! 
[0:59:11] <Mangahero18> But I thought Jubilaeus was the creator of reality? Wasnt she explicitly called a Creator Deity multiple times in the first game? This many drastic lore changes is the kind of thing id expect from a decades long series going through a reboot. Not a sequel to a single game.
[0:59:15] <+xtian9811> This is the best thing to happen to my sleepless night
[0:59:17] <0rond> the lumen sage is playable in the co-op mode (as is rodin) buy yeah him not being normally playable is bull
[0:59:28] <Grandma_Amari> Bayo is so fucking cool
[0:59:34] <+Pilau32> isn't it like 6 am? lol
[0:59:50] <%Mendin> She summons the lady satan with her hair and doesnt afraid of anything
[0:59:53] <%Mendin> climaxing nonstop
[0:59:53] <%Romuken> yo just got in. Did he start an hour ago, or like 30min ago after doing talk stuff?
[0:59:54] <beefomkers> Pat has been spending his time wisely
[0:59:56] <%Dakuu75> yep
[1:00:01] <0rond> @Mangahero18 I mean jubileios had a demon equivalent so from the get go it wasn't really that straightforward
[1:00:02] <beefomkers> Playing this
[1:00:05] <@SoFarFetched> geefChair
[1:00:08] <beefomkers> and thinking
[1:00:18] <beefomkers> canadian thoughts
[1:00:27] <%TrafficCohen> WHO wants a burger at 3 am?
[1:00:27] <beefomkers> very frightening
[1:00:28] <@SoFarFetched> birdy mirdy hmmmmm
[1:00:35] <huskarl_zap> about the point
[1:00:36] <PanicSwytch> I guess the mind goblins are keeping Pat from sleeping
[1:00:37] <%Chichen> pat commentary in bayo combat: "bird... bird... Birdy..."
[1:00:42] <Mangahero18> Who? I dont remember any mention in the first game of her having a 'demon' counterpart.
[1:00:49] <Ell1ot> tiger, tiger, tiger
[1:00:53] <%XeroSigmaPrime> XeroSigmaPrime subscribed at Tier 1. They've subscribed for 19 months! WHAT THE FUCK, I woke up from a fever nightmare and now Pat is here to sooth me? Am I still sleeping?! Plz comfort me with the sounds of sexy hair witch lady.
[1:00:54] <@SoFarFetched> Im just seeing this as Pat's reason to quote kung pow at 6am
[1:01:03] <beefomkers> as I said, canadian thoughts. horrifying.
[1:01:05] <+OwlLightningMage> The thing she uses to punch her into the sun
[1:01:12] <Wan6Saber> tenchiGG
[1:01:12] <KinduVborrd> Why is the story in TW101 so enjoyable with so many likeable characters, while Bayonetta's is boring, confusing and with, like, three likeable characters?
[1:01:13] <huskarl_zap> not gonna lie i found a borger in the fridge at 3 am and had it
[1:01:18] <+gespenst25> hmm
[1:01:21] <%CherteuseKapibara> why is the kid wearing the Millennium Puzzle
[1:01:21] <Mangahero18> Also, if Rodin is a fallen angel turned demon why the FUCK does he look so much different from regular Angels?
[1:01:29] <%Dakuu75> charles, GET OUT OF MY MIND
[1:01:33] <%Daniel_Is_I> Convincing scream
[1:01:35] <Wan6Saber> ha
[1:01:37] <Hanyusha> talk about a blast from the past
[1:01:43] <+fockniapo> fan the flames, we are raising a cheeseborgar
[1:01:48] <+BIumen> just not gonna discuss that huh
[1:01:52] <beefomkers> I dunno. Why does sparda just look like a dude
[1:02:02] <%Monkeyweed21> pat why are streaming now?
[1:02:02] <Mangahero18> Also, how did Jubilaeus die in the first place? Was that ever explained?
[1:02:05] <Geno4344> @Mangahero18 that's racist
[1:02:06] <+fockniapo> the man was brutish, he wanted gold, for a CHEESEBORGAR, madness!
[1:02:07] <%XeroSigmaPrime> Cuz Rodin is hawt
[1:02:16] <+fockniapo> this is good stream time
[1:02:17] <moonmintparadise> The presence of Loki makes Bayonetta 2 worse
[1:02:23] <+fockniapo> 12:00 in spain
[1:02:25] <+OwlLightningMage> How did Sparda die?
[1:02:26] <%Dakuu75> oh shit, backtracking? now it's a REAL stream mf-ers
[1:02:37] <%Romuken> SNEK
[1:02:37] <beefomkers> Mundus
[1:02:38] <TheAntiNihilist> !uptime
[1:02:38] <@Moobot> I've been playing this game for how long? Oh only 1h 2m.
[1:02:39] <+fockniapo> whooa
[1:02:43] <moonmintparadise> Snek tiem
[1:02:44] <+fockniapo> turns into a snake
[1:02:52] <%Monkeyweed21> why did Pat start streaming at 6 a.m.?
[1:02:55] <+fockniapo> reptile
[1:02:57] <Geno4344> he woke up to justice but he needed to go back to sleep
[1:03:02] <beefomkers> Turns into a snake (epic style)
[1:03:05] <+fockniapo> its a good time to stream
[1:03:05] <KinduVborrd> Kulshedra's not in 2, is it?
[1:03:06] <huskarl_zap> Mundas is Sparda's brother Kappa
[1:03:06] <+azure_dekuman> slippery snek
[1:03:13] <+OwlLightningMage> Sparda was the biggest and the toughest, so how did he die?
[1:03:13] <%Mendin> Ok, so: at the beginning of time, Heaven/Hell/Chaos was one realm. Something Happened that sundered creation into three pieces, and Jubileus got KOd in the process
[1:03:18] <+fockniapo> reptile
[1:03:24] <beefomkers> Mundus
[1:03:28] <Vermilingus> And it's broken as shit
[1:03:30] <Mangahero18> @beefomkers He DOESNT. He's a gross bugman! When Arkham Transforms using the Force Edge in DM3 into his BugKnight form THATS what Sparda looks like for reals.
[1:03:31] <beefomkers> Mundus did it
[1:03:31] <%Mendin> The Chaos part of reality gave birth to Aesir who quantum observed reality into the Mortal Realm
[1:03:33] <KinduVborrd> But the foot whip can't snatch, though, right?
[1:03:35] <+OwlLightningMage> He just made his swords and then ditched his family?
[1:03:37] <NitronStreams> alright it 6 am im sleb. good luck with the bayo 2 pat
[1:03:40] <+fockniapo> skip cinematic? y
[1:03:41] <0rond> the bayo 2 whips are crazy strong
[1:03:45] <Hanyusha> @OwlLightningMage that's the thing, we don't even know if he's dead
[1:03:49] <+thecosmicfly> Lord help me, first thing coming to mind watching this segment was Sonic 2006
[1:03:50] <%Dakuu75> if you go too far down in the water, will you jsut die?
[1:03:51] <beefomkers> No but he becomes just a dude
[1:03:55] <+OwlLightningMage> Sparda sounds like a stupid idiot
[1:03:55] <+Over_ninek> @fockniapo backtracking
[1:03:57] <Mangahero18> You can tell because Dante/Virgil ALSO become weird bugmen when they use Devil Trigger.
[1:03:59] <TheAntiNihilist> this art style is FF13 AS FUCK
[1:03:59] <Hanyusha> Sparda is just missing
[1:04:01] <%jnoble919> Shoutout from Yokosuka Naval Base, thank god for Pat's insomnia
[1:04:09] <+fockniapo> true
[1:04:17] <+fockniapo> backtracing
[1:04:26] <%Mendin> Do we have further questions about the Lore Timeline of Reality?
[1:04:27] <+DraggoonLord> I played through all of Bayo 2 with Love is Blue bc I have mind goblins that only allow me to play with the "canon" loadout
[1:04:28] <beefomkers> Spardas devil trigger is turning into a 53 year old human man
[1:04:36] <+DraggoonLord> how much did I fuck myself out of having fun
[1:04:41] <+fockniapo> wtf sun face
[1:04:42] <+OwlLightningMage> Sparda got kidnapped and has been suffering CBT all this time
[1:04:50] <+Over_ninek> He's so cool!
[1:04:56] <%Mendin> wow sword embiggen
[1:04:57] <+Yopomo> patracing
[1:04:59] <0rond> this part is sick
[1:04:59] <+thecutethulhu> I love the fact the shield smirks before it swings the sword.
[1:05:00] <+BIumen> oh well shit then
[1:05:11] <Shardlab> Are we compensating for something, angel?
[1:05:14] <Hanyusha> @OwlLightningMage the swords are even more weird than Sparda, he sealed his power in Force Edge, but where did he get Yamato and Rebellion? And why does one separates and other unites?
[1:05:15] <beefomkers> @owllightningmage Is that canon I thought he was dear
[1:05:18] <beefomkers> dead
[1:05:18] <0rond> ah yes, I will put my face, the weak spot, on my shield that I protect myself with
[1:05:20] <Mangahero18> That sword is almost as big as Masamune.
[1:05:21] <+McFluffums> putting your weak point on the front of your shield is...a brave choice
[1:05:21] <KingKrampus> pat why are you streaming it is 6 in the fucking morning
[1:05:23] <+fockniapo> a good sword embiggens a good spirit
[1:05:25] <beefomkers> no wait that's DMC
[1:05:35] <+fockniapo> URBAN CLIMAX
[1:05:35] <%Dakuu75> putting your fucking-FACE... ON the shield seems like an intentional design flaw.
[1:05:50] <%tux_3do> daily PSA to mention this game fecking rocks
[1:05:52] <Hanyusha> talk about face tanking
[1:05:54] <beefomkers> Why have one sword when you can have three swords
[1:05:54] <+OwlLightningMage> I was joking. I don't know what ACTUALLY happened to Sparda
[1:05:58] <%sausagesausage> nice shield idiot
[1:05:58] <huskarl_zap> The Aesir over burden the human with a heavy handed punishment then Tyr spends half the game in a ship fighting one mirrion goblins and Thor....Oh wait this is Too Human again srry
[1:06:02] <KingKrampus> this just makes me want to see Bayonetta vs Jesus
[1:06:16] <Forkeye> @owllightningmage the description for the sparda sword in dmc5 that he split his power into 3 swords rebellion, yamato, and sparda
[1:06:16] <+fockniapo> jesus is king
[1:06:21] <beefomkers> Sparda was a baller who had more swords than any pussy ass demon
[1:06:25] <%Mendin> God is a woman
[1:06:26] <scizor285> good morning pat. I can't sleep.
[1:06:32] <beefomkers> name another with three
[1:06:44] <+OwlLightningMage> Sparda split his power between three swords and two amulets. We all forget about the amulets that were only important in one game LUL
[1:06:47] <Ner234> That was cool
[1:06:50] <huskarl_zap> looks like we gotta wake woolie to make the woolaid
[1:06:50] <KingKrampus> would Jesus vs Bayonetta Jesus be a badass shepherd or what
[1:06:51] <Hanyusha> Were Rebellion and Yamato demons Sparda defeated at some point?
[1:07:08] <Mangahero18> Nah.
[1:07:19] <%Chichen> Leviathan Leviathan
[1:07:21] <beefomkers> Jesus wouldn't fight he's a pacifist
[1:07:22] <jimmytwofeet> Hold up? Pat streaming at this time? :o
[1:07:22] <0rond> rain drops stopping in the frozen time? I sleep. SLASHING CLEAVING THE WATER? REAL SHIT.
[1:07:24] <+fockniapo> wtf gigaton
[1:07:25] <Mangahero18> He just WOKE UP TO JUSTICE one day and had two swords in his hands.
[1:07:26] <Hanyusha> @OwlLightningMage does it say that Sparda made Yamato and Rebellion?
[1:07:34] <beefomkers> Or maybe he'd use a whip
[1:07:36] <KinduVborrd> They say Sparda died at the very beginning of DMC1, why do so many people forget this
[1:07:44] <$feiashtear> good morning
[1:07:44] <+OwlLightningMage> I don't know
[1:07:45] <+fockniapo> nice
[1:07:49] <+fockniapo> go to hell
[1:07:51] <beefomkers> says in le biblé he whipped some guys
[1:07:53] <+OwlLightningMage> HOW DID HE DIE IF HE WAS SO TOUGH
[1:07:55] <%Dakuu75> reminds me of the ending to the movie "drag me to hell"
[1:08:00] <beefomkers> for fucking around in a church
[1:08:01] <+fockniapo> biblé
[1:08:03] <+OwlLightningMage> SPARDA MAKES NO SENSE LUL
[1:08:04] <+Gespens> It's a cool setpiece
[1:08:07] <Vermilingus> Cool though
[1:08:07] <%Monkeyweed21> he sent you to horny kail
[1:08:10] <KingKrampus> Jesus has a Castlevania whip
[1:08:12] <%Mendin> I miss the angels dying with "MAY JUBILEUS THE CREATOR BLESS YOU" as they get dragged off to hell
[1:08:16] <%Mendin> The most ominous benedictioon
[1:08:16] <0rond> oh yeah if sparda was so cool and strong how come he died
[1:08:19] <Chorkly> Turns out having your face on your shield isn't the best idea.
[1:08:26] <Forkeye> @hanyusha yes sparda made rebellion and yamato
[1:08:33] <+thecosmicfly> I looked away and the fight is over?
[1:08:37] <+fockniapo> oh shit seymour guado
[1:08:39] <huskarl_zap> but who holds the keyes?
[1:08:40] <+fockniapo> from guadosalam
[1:08:45] <+OwlLightningMage> Sparda sounds like a dumbass LUL
[1:08:48] <%Monkeyweed21> god thats such a bad robe
[1:08:49] <KinduVborrd> I hate his outfit
[1:08:51] <%Chichen> yep
[1:08:52] <KingKrampus> wait would Jesus just be a Simon Belmont mirror
[1:08:52] <%Mendin> Triangle Man, Triangle Man. Triangle Man hates Particle Man
[1:09:03] <%Chichen> bayo 2 final boss fuckin SUUUUCKS design wise
[1:09:08] <+thecutethulhu> This outfit's garbage, yeah, but it gets better.
[1:09:09] <+fockniapo> holy shit a well dressed male
[1:09:13] <+Over_ninek> we dont know either Luka
[1:09:14] <beefomkers> Sparda rocks he woke up to justice fucked a bitch and died
[1:09:17] <KingKrampus> they have a fight, triangle wins triangle man
[1:09:20] <KinduVborrd> It's a weird poncho with some gold shit
[1:09:21] <Mangahero18> So if Demons get stronger if they 'wake up to justice' and embrace positive emotions as its explicitly stated Sparda did does that mean Angels get stronger if they embrace Evil and Negative emotions?
[1:09:25] <TheAntiNihilist> triangle man was born that way. you can't blame him
[1:09:29] <beefomkers> After turning himself into swords
[1:09:32] <Chorkly> What is that child's accent meant to be.
[1:09:50] <beefomkers> There aren't angels in devil may cry
[1:09:54] <huskarl_zap> Sparada and Tyr hold the keyes to Solomin's wisdom but only master queef can be the reclaimer of the seventh keyes
[1:10:03] <+fockniapo> litol wan aa uu ooait
[1:10:04] <beefomkers> the ones that look like angels are demons too
[1:10:05] <%Mendin> I am the shadow, the true self. Let expanse contract, eon become instant. THROW WIDE THE GATES SO THAT WE MAY PASS
[1:10:08] <Manipulator98> is that arsenal gear
[1:10:09] <saiyanblitz> @mangahero18 I guess kaggyTHINK
[1:10:26] <KinduVborrd> WHIP BOOTS
[1:10:27] <%tux_3do> i rly hope these yakuza ass clock cutscenes arent in bayo 3
[1:10:29] <Forkeye> @beefomkers when you die dont you wanna become a cool pair of nunchucks?
[1:10:30] <%tux_3do> if bayo 3 comes out
[1:10:30] <%Monkeyweed21> a kid with a dumb tattoo
[1:10:41] <Mangahero18> I mean RODIN became super fucking strong when HE fell from heaven right?
[1:10:46] <+justianxix> Aahh yeah, Demon Time!
[1:10:56] <Mangahero18> He's the strongest boss in the first game as a Secret Boss
[1:10:58] <+OwlLightningMage> That's super true
[1:11:02] <beefomkers> She's going to turn water into whine then she's going to drink it while eating icecream and watching sitcoms
[1:11:04] <YujinYo> Yo that guy looks like ardyn
[1:11:07] <%Mendin> Rodin was like the Chief Blacksmith Of Heaven before he fell from heaven so he was already Swole As Fuck
[1:11:10] <huskarl_zap> THE CONSOOMER
[1:11:11] <0rond> rodin was super strong before he fell too
[1:11:13] <moonmintparadise> The Demon designs are so much cooler than the Angels holy fuck
[1:11:13] <TheAntiNihilist> I just realized. is the Bayonetta series just a big Shota Hentai?
[1:11:15] <%Mendin> He gave form to Divine Will or some shit
[1:11:15] <+Over_ninek> i always took took Rodin's "fall" to mean he just left rather than was ejected
[1:11:18] <+OwlLightningMage> Rodin is fallen angel and is the strongest one
[1:11:21] <%GarbageNirvana> This a goddamn SMT boss
[1:11:28] <0rond> rodin was like the strongest in heaven and than fell and became the strongest devil
[1:11:28] <+thecosmicfly> Sup Kyogre
[1:11:29] <%Valdorick> You play'n those devil games, Patty!?
[1:11:30] <+thecutethulhu> This one's a really weird fight.
[1:11:33] <beefomkers> The demons love you too pat
[1:11:47] <beefomkers> Become a satanist today!
[1:11:49] <+justianxix> I love how most are just GEOMETRY
[1:11:52] <%Monkeyweed21> they're organic designs covering weird robots
[1:11:53] <Ell1ot> giant eyeball and tentacles. is this a resident evil?
[1:11:54] <saiyanblitz> @theantinihilist how?
[1:11:54] <%Alazull> @patstaresat you and the sneaky late night strem
[1:12:04] <+Over_ninek> oof
[1:12:09] <+Over_ninek> that looked painful
[1:12:17] <%Dakuu75> "for dry, red eye... use clear eye... wow."
[1:12:20] <beefomkers> Cubes are cool
[1:12:27] <+OwlLightningMage> Rodin should make himself into three swords and 2 amulets and die like Sparda
[1:12:31] <+justianxix> The demons are big math nerds
[1:12:40] <huskarl_zap> @dakuu75 nice LUL
[1:12:48] <%tux_3do> hit the birken eye
[1:13:11] <+OwlLightningMage> I hate how many boss fights in this game are in the air
[1:13:13] <jessicaaquin0> so the angels are towards being organic and the demons are just machines?
[1:13:13] <+TehBrickz> Wtf it’s 6am when did this happen
[1:13:14] <DianaTheAscian> theres a yugioh archetype about cubes I think
[1:13:22] <beefomkers> @patstaresat This is an important question. If you were a demon and Dante killed you what kind of weapon would you turn into?
[1:13:41] <+Over_ninek> @TehBrickz at about 5am LUL
[1:13:42] <+OwlLightningMage> Pat would become a toilet LUL
[1:13:43] <+thecosmicfly> @beefomkers a poop knife
[1:13:43] <Geno4344> a potato bomb
[1:13:49] <%tux_3do> @beefomkers a dessert spoon
[1:13:54] <0rond> angels are all weird disgusting flesh beasts but demons are all mechanical
[1:13:57] <+TehBrickz> @over_ninek niceee
[1:13:57] <Mangahero18> Lazer Fork. A Giant Battle Fork that shoots lazers.
[1:13:58] <beefomkers> I'm thinking codpiece that shoots lasers
[1:14:00] <+OwlLightningMage> A toilet shoots redbull
[1:14:07] <%Alazull> Madama Butterfly says no to vore
[1:14:14] <Commander_Deko> shibuy4Kirby2 now its a kirby boss
[1:14:15] <+Gespens> Angels are architecture, Demons are engineering
[1:14:22] <%Monkeyweed21> CAN YOU DEFEAT YOUR BRAND PAT?
[1:14:28] <%Dakuu75> so, dose Madam Butterfly just unironically like bayo or does bayo just do a good job of keeping her bound?
[1:14:29] <TheAntiNihilist> @saiyanblitz tentacle monsters, big lady with little child, basically sex scenes if the bullets were dicks
[1:14:30] <%Mendin> Madama Butterfly says YES to stepping on you though uwu
[1:14:30] <zipperdude33> Pat go to bed
[1:14:40] <HelluvaNohbody> It's a pokeball eye
[1:14:44] <%Mendin> She's Bayo's Infernal Pact Patron
[1:14:47] <0rond> this is a terraria boss
[1:14:48] <filialpails> decarabia's gonna be waiting to meet up with this guy next to the hachiko statue but he's never going to show up :c
[1:14:52] <beefomkers> You people are too horny
[1:15:01] <beefomkers> Bayonetta is a classy lady
[1:15:08] <0rond> ugh
[1:15:14] <%tux_3do> @beefomkers why not both
[1:15:17] <Mangahero18> WE DONT NEED YOUR HELP YUGI
[1:15:17] <%Mendin> Umbra Witches make a deal with one of the Big Femdom Satans of Hell in order to gain their power and M. Butterfly is a good boss
[1:15:18] <beefomkers> And also an action game protagonist from Japan
[1:15:23] <Ner234> SIlver?! Reset
[1:15:24] <beefomkers> So she's never fucked
[1:15:30] <beefomkers> You know this.
[1:15:39] <Geno4344> NOOOO I DON'T WANT TO GO TO JABU JABU'S BELLY
[1:15:42] <huskarl_zap> Always a bigger fish
[1:15:42] <%Alazull> Must be nice in your unhorny ivory tower
[1:15:50] <%psydaku> @filialpails nice forneus reference
[1:15:51] <%LonePlus_> its the whale part from dmc 3
[1:15:52] <Commander_Deko> shibuy4Jotaro no
[1:15:59] <+Gespens> Oh no, it's DMC3 Leviathan!
[1:16:00] <%TheWinged7> booo
[1:16:01] <beefomkers> ...
[1:16:07] <+Ghufufin> rorb
[1:16:07] <%Monkeyweed21> and you get red orbs
[1:16:08] <%GarbageNirvana> Oh they're...actually just orbs
[1:16:09] <+BIumen> ooey gooey
[1:16:14] <huskarl_zap> Is this The Point?
[1:16:14] <%Dakuu75> yeah... kingdom hearts did it too.
[1:16:18] <%Kitafin> the savior
[1:16:19] <0rond> this game just throws you from location to location, no real progression
[1:16:20] <+Gespens> In DMC5, half the game was a gooey level!
[1:16:20] <saiyanblitz> Wait a minute Rorbs
[1:16:21] <Mangahero18> Just straight up Orbs from DMC. Like, not even trying to hid its the same universe.
[1:16:29] <KinduVborrd> The whale part is just supposed to be like hell from the end of DMC1
[1:16:35] <%Dakuu75> he'll NEVER lose agro~!
[1:16:44] <%Dakuu75> -he holds ALL the enmity
[1:17:06] <huskarl_zap> PLAY SUBHUMAN
[1:17:07] <jorniev> wat
[1:17:33] <KinduVborrd> How Pat mash so fast
[1:17:44] <KinduVborrd> Teach me the ways
[1:17:45] <Mangahero18> HOW THE FUCK DID SHE GET HEART BULLETS FROM ONE SHOT
[1:17:48] <huskarl_zap> When Hatereds are on screen Subhuman should play
[1:17:52] <Tomschiii> wish my emu Back then could run bayo 2. Looks so fun
[1:17:54] <+OwlLightningMage> The Demon weapons suck
[1:17:55] <blackbaron98> That makes no sense lol
[1:17:58] <beefomkers> Why play the virgin "subhuman" (fitting name) when you play the Chad Burry The Light?
[1:18:00] <0rond> oh yeah the way she breaks demon barriers is different and makes no sense
[1:18:09] <%Monkeyweed21> thats just round trip
[1:18:22] <jessicaaquin0> @Mangahero18 witch magiccc
[1:18:22] <0rond> it's the pandora boomerang
[1:18:24] <%ElCarneAsada> Patathan why are you streaming at 5 in the morning
[1:18:26] <+OwlLightningMage> Subhuman is so bad it boggles the mind
[1:18:39] <Ner234> I just assumed she shoots really fast in a pattern
[1:18:47] <Ner234> It just looks like one shot
[1:18:49] <0rond> i'm glad they made breakdance less useless i nthis one
[1:18:50] <%Dakuu75> gief has resting-bitch-face
[1:18:51] <%tux_3do> personally im just glad hes streaming early, as an australian everybody always streams when im asleep
[1:18:51] <beefomkers> He's the main character why is his theme so shit I don't get it
[1:18:53] <+Gespens> Subhuman grew on it
[1:18:56] <+Gespens> on me*
[1:18:57] <+enward_hardar> PAT GO TO BED
[1:19:02] <+OwlLightningMage> Bury the Devil's Tears under Crimson Clouds
[1:19:05] <%Monkeyweed21> Pat really needs to fix his sleep schedule
[1:19:08] <Mangahero18> For that matter, why is your Halo Count going up from collecting Rorbs? An item that is explicitly stated in DMC to be crystalized Demon Blood.
[1:19:17] <Commander_Deko> @Gespens Like a parasitic growth I'm sure
[1:19:18] <beefomkers> Tumors can grow on you too, you know
[1:19:19] <Mangahero18> SO MANY QUESTIONS.
[1:19:20] <Sp1teface> People are still hating on Subhuman in 2021? DansGame
[1:19:20] <jorniev> what are the new weapons?
[1:19:28] <%tux_3do> @beefomkers tbh nero feels more like the main protagonist so theme checks out
[1:19:36] <+OwlLightningMage> Subhuman is bad
[1:19:39] <zipperdude33> Nothing says “sleep deprivation” like doing some sick bayo combos
[1:19:48] <DianaTheAscian> whats under the gem stuff?
[1:19:54] <%Mendin> Your merchant deals in both heaven and hell juice, and apparently the currency exchhange rate is good
[1:19:57] <+Gespens> I like the genre. It's easily the worst DMC theme, but it was okay
[1:20:00] <beefomkers> Virgil is the main character of Devil May Cry
[1:20:03] <huskarl_zap> Subhumanists rise BlackLivesMatter BlackLivesMatter BlackLivesMatter BlackLivesMatter BlackLivesMatter
[1:20:07] <%Valdorick> Just do
[1:20:13] <%Dakuu75> Pat doesn't need to fix his sleep schedule, we just need to wreck ours, more. doodBro
[1:20:14] <+OwlLightningMage> Subhuman sounds like it was a rejected song from DMC Devil May Cry
[1:20:23] <$thomassolorio> can't sleep either huh
[1:20:31] <jorniev> subhuman is for subhumans
[1:20:32] <That_Mojo> i hope dmc6 gives ddante a cool theme
[1:20:37] <+vinnysuperg123> Wait Pat wtf it’s 6am
[1:20:44] <%Monkeyweed21> petition to rename cummies to drippies
[1:20:49] <jorniev> i slept like 6 hours
[1:20:52] <beefomkers> @huskarl_zap You sure you wanna associate that emote with the term subhuman
[1:20:52] <Mangahero18> aww...I was hoping he'd choke. Btw these are SOOOO much easier than the ones in Bayo1
[1:20:53] <%Valdorick> ... Are you a cat in vagina?
[1:20:56] <0rond> who the heck wants to paly bayonetta 2 at 5 AM?
[1:20:56] <+marquezpsp> ayy Bayo 2. the sequel that looks better but plays worse.
[1:20:56] <Geno4344> I hope DMC6 gives Dante a lawnmower weapon
[1:20:59] <jorniev> how long has he been streaming?
[1:21:02] <0rond> OH BOY 5 AM
[1:21:03] <zipperdude33> DMC 6 is just going to give everyone bury the light as their theme and I’d be ok with that
[1:21:04] <$thomassolorio> aren't we just
[1:21:11] <+OwlLightningMage> I hope we get to play as Dante's child in DMC6
[1:21:15] <KinduVborrd> My cat woke me up four hours ago
[1:21:19] <Commander_Deko> @Geno4344 and your taunt is pulling out a can of monster while riding it
[1:21:22] <beefomkers> DANTE
[1:21:23] <+marquezpsp> look at this DMC3 boss
[1:21:25] <beefomkers> DOES NOT

[1:21:51] <+thecutethulhu> @thecutethulhu is new here. Say hello! HeyGuys
[1:21:56] <KinduVborrd> Are y'all ready for one of the sickest boss arenas ever?
[1:21:57] <+Over_ninek> he's so cool
[1:22:02] <jimmytwofeet> WHERE WERE THOSE EYES LOOKING PAT
[1:22:04] <+OwlLightningMage> All the Lumen Sage fights are bad except the final one
[1:22:05] <huskarl_zap> @beefomkers i just need fists and saw it first
[1:22:06] <%tux_3do> dante fucks but unlike his brother he knows how to pull out
[1:22:12] <Geno4344> no bayonetta he's...
[1:22:15] <%Valdorick> Crispin Freeman?
[1:22:19] <%Dakuu75> fight your Vergil
[1:22:22] <MsVcol> dante doesn't know what sex is, shut up
[1:22:28] <beefomkers> Besides Dante is gen x so if he has a kid at his age they'll come out fucked up
[1:22:30] <saiyanblitz> Alucard
[1:22:31] <huskarl_zap> Also cummies are now Drippies LUL
[1:22:31] <KinduVborrd> That Vergil-ass walk
[1:22:34] <+marquezpsp> I like the lumen sage transformation. bout a contrast to Bayo and okami reference
[1:22:42] <+OwlLightningMage> Dante's kid will be a science experiment
[1:22:44] <%Valdorick> Dante things sex is a drink.
[1:22:46] <beefomkers> That's genes for you
[1:22:47] <%Valdorick> You have on the rocks.
[1:22:47] <jorniev> lumen sage 2?
[1:22:49] <Commander_Deko> uh oh
[1:22:54] <0rond> this fight is sick
[1:22:54] <%Monkeyweed21> if Bayonetta uses her hair to summon demons, does the Sage use his Pubes?
[1:22:54] <+thecutethulhu> This is "Can you dodge multiple times" the fight.
[1:22:55] <0rond> a shame it sucks
[1:23:03] <DianaTheAscian> god thats so cool
[1:23:12] <donaghy> I for one welcome Pat's new Australian prime time streaming hours
[1:23:14] <beefomkers> @huskarl_zap I was fucking with you, compadre
[1:23:15] <PanicSwytch> This fight is great
[1:23:25] <%Dakuu75> wasn't the kid up there?
[1:23:25] <%tux_3do> i wish we got to play him in the story, not just the co-op challenges
[1:23:28] <Ell1ot> eeeeeeeeeeew
[1:23:28] <huskarl_zap> This stage is Pat's butthole before ejecting chilli
[1:23:28] <%Mendin> Ah yes extra juicy
[1:23:34] <Geno4344> the sage uses his nose hairs
[1:23:41] <+OwlLightningMage> Nico is gonna find a lab from her dad and inside will be notes detailing a failed Sparda recreation made from Dante LUL
[1:23:41] <beefomkers> There are Australians in this chat right now
[1:23:42] <Commander_Deko> shibuy4Dio easy mode is now unlocked
[1:23:45] <+thecutethulhu> Ded.
[1:23:47] <%GarbageNirvana> What's that smell
[1:23:53] <%tux_3do> easy mode is now selectable
[1:23:58] <0rond> this fight really shows the the problem with bayonetta 2's higher level combat
[1:23:59] <%Mendin> THE SHADOW REMAINS CAST
[1:23:59] <@SoFarFetched> early warm up
[1:24:00] <beefomkers> Sad. Many such cases!
[1:24:02] <Dave_VD> How do you unlock him? Just keep laying tag climax?
[1:24:04] <huskarl_zap> PATS ASS JUST KEEPS FILLING WITH BLOOD
[1:24:11] <jorniev> what
[1:24:14] <Ner234> Lumen Sage fights are about the closest you can get to playing an anime fight.
[1:24:20] <%Chichen> what
[1:24:30] <%vociferousrex> vociferousrex subscribed at Tier 1. They've subscribed for 7 months, currently on a 7 month streak! 
[1:24:37] <OneThousandTomatoes> !uptime
[1:24:38] <@Moobot> I've been playing this game for how long? Oh only 1h 24m.
[1:24:40] <%tux_3do> bork boi
[1:24:43] <+OwlLightningMage> These fights are bad except the final one
[1:24:49] <%Valdorick> So does this guy also need to strip to use his Summons?
[1:25:03] <0rond> remember "you can only attack enemies in witch time" muspelheim? it was a tutorial for this fight
[1:25:04] <%tux_3do> @Valdorick sadly no
[1:25:05] <beefomkers> I believe the word you're looking for is "wolf."
[1:25:13] <huskarl_zap> no he puts on more hijabs
[1:25:13] <%thatfeel> Big goo time
[1:25:18] <saiyanblitz> Is it weird that both Crispin Freeman and Yuri Lowethal are in this game
[1:25:19] <%vaporousTippler> He strips on the inside.
[1:25:20] <Mangahero18> Your battle in this verse is LITERALLY tearing up the insides of the demon and filling it with blood. Brutal...this dumb demon is getting the worst case of indegestion ever.
[1:25:20] <Geno4344> panther/lynx/wolf within always was an okami reference *points gun at the back of pat's head*
[1:25:21] <KinduVborrd> Dogs are wolves
[1:25:24] <+OwlLightningMage> Wolf is dog but in outside
[1:25:31] <%Dakuu75> @Valdorick no, it's the opposite for him. he needs to put on MORE clothes
[1:25:42] <+OwlLightningMage> Wolf is big doggo on outside
[1:25:44] <beefomkers> Dogs are not wolves
[1:25:46] <%Mendin> okami means wolf but it also means god, ayyyy
[1:25:55] <KinduVborrd> Dogs are wolves
[1:25:57] <%Valdorick> Damn Puritans, stopping us from seeing hot bods
[1:25:58] <Teh10sorrow> Okey i love how they made Lumen Sage cool in a way that does not class with Bayonetta, he is not a Dante character or a Vergil type character. He is not a religous crazy character. Instead he is all elagance and grace that weirdly matches how Jeane and Bayonatta moves.
[1:26:03] <+thecutethulhu> It's also funny that he summons versions of various boss angels.
[1:26:10] <%LadyRarityV> LadyRarityV subscribed at Tier 1. They've subscribed for 3 months! Was just starting my morning before taking my own fur baby to the vet and saw that you were on. A nice surprise to start the morning. Thanks Pat!
[1:26:15] <beefomkers> No they aren't. Chihuahuas aren't wolves
[1:26:33] <KinduVborrd> They are small wolves
[1:26:34] <%tux_3do> say what you want about the combat balancing, the music still s l a p s
[1:26:35] <beefomkers> They're canines
[1:26:41] <beefomkers> but they aren't wolves
[1:26:42] <%Mendin> Just both summoning your pet Kaiju in the background of the brawl
[1:26:46] <beefomkers> We aren't monkeys
[1:26:50] <+OwlLightningMage> Shut up. Doggo is all
[1:26:51] <atema128> Whoah, early stream.
[1:26:51] <0rond> THE WATER CREATURES
[1:26:54] <beefomkers> We're primates
[1:26:58] <DianaTheAscian> what happens when they summon something to big?
[1:26:58] <Mangahero18> chihauhau's are ugly rats
[1:26:59] <+OwlLightningMage> Human and inside monkey
[1:27:02] <+Fep3> chihuahuas are basically wolves
[1:27:05] <beefomkers> but not monkeys
[1:27:08] <KinduVborrd> Dogs can produce fertile offspring with wolves, they're the same species
[1:27:09] <%thatfeel> Dogs are related to wolves
[1:27:13] <jorniev> WHAT IS THAT
[1:27:18] <+OwlLightningMage> Humans are monkeys inside house
[1:27:19] <huskarl_zap> Japanese Priestess wear Wolf graphic t shirts to hinor Okami
[1:27:25] <Geno4344> I liked the temperantia vs madama butterfly kaiju fight better because you could actally see it happening
[1:27:42] <+Over_ninek> that red hot kick
[1:27:47] <%TheWinged7> stando battle
[1:27:53] <DianaTheAscian> YO
[1:28:03] <Ell1ot> nom
[1:28:10] <Mangahero18> Get it? He turns into a dogger because Bayonetta turns into a Cato.
[1:28:11] <+thecosmicfly> Monkeys are just outside humans
[1:28:12] <+thecutethulhu> HEADBUTT INTO THE DEMON HELL YEAH!
[1:28:12] <beefomkers> horses can breed with donkeys
[1:28:25] <beefomkers> but horses aren't donkeys
[1:28:28] <Commander_Deko> thats how zebras are made
[1:28:37] <+OwlLightningMage> White doggo go bark
[1:28:43] <0rond> I love how the hydra goes "oh no ya don't"
[1:28:43] <Geno4344> can we get a russian umbra witch that turns into a bear
[1:28:45] <KinduVborrd> They can't consistently create fertile offspring though
[1:28:46] <%Mendin> I want this guy for Smash
[1:28:52] <Mangahero18> Light and Dark, White and Black, Cats and Dogs, Hair and No Hair. These things are all opposites.
[1:28:57] <huskarl_zap> On screen now is the process of donkey impregnation
[1:29:06] <+thecosmicfly> Are zebras white with black stripes or black with white stripes? We'll never know
[1:29:10] <ThatGuyThere03> Pat what the fuck

[1:34:50] <@SoFarFetched> oh shit is that No Man's Sky
[1:34:54] <KinduVborrd> Evangelion time

[1:35:00] <%Kirby_Sauce> cheer500 yes scublordes, I too am awake at this ungodly hour, because i went to sleep at 7pm *after not sleeping for 28 hours* is the audio weird to anyone else?
[1:35:02] <%tux_3do> thats literally just ramiel
[1:35:04] <Mangahero18> And that's how we got baby pat...the definitely NOT re-incarnation of Rasputin.
[1:35:09] <+Over_ninek> sup Ramiel
[1:35:13] <%Valdorick> hawt
[1:35:17] <DianaTheAscian> yeah
[1:35:18] <%tux_3do> geometric screaming
[1:35:21] <jorniev> YUUUP
[1:35:22] <%LadyRarityV> yeyeyeyeye
[1:35:25] <beefomkers> Something something the anime about christianity
[1:35:27] <@SoFarFetched> That's probably you kirby and need a refresh.
[1:35:28] <%Alazull> @patstaresat Gal Pals!
[1:35:29] <moonmintparadise> Bayonetta goes to hell to save her super best gal pal
[1:35:32] <beefomkers> fanta
[1:35:49] <+fockniapo> orange fanta is cool
[1:35:52] <roadhog29389> God, They're so british
[1:35:57] <+fockniapo> it was used as tang in evangelion
[1:35:58] <KinduVborrd> Very shiny bricks
[1:36:00] <Spudnacious_Dynasty> Hell is bigit'sprobably got ecosystems
[1:36:01] <%Kirby_Sauce> nah, it's still weird
[1:36:03] <%GarbageNirvana> Satan's constantly remodeling
[1:36:06] <KinduVborrd> So glossy
[1:36:06] <+thecutethulhu> Do you think that all of the time that Bayonetta 3's not out is time they're doing to make fully animated cutscenes?
[1:36:07] <huskarl_zap> Jean will Cig filter Bayonetta's farts
[1:36:10] <beefomkers> Hell is just floating shit
[1:36:15] <@SoFarFetched> try a restart or closing the browser,since audio seems fine for everyone else.
[1:36:18] <%Mendin> I mean thi sis like the antechamber of Hell
[1:36:22] <%Kirby_Sauce> pat's audio is fine, it's the game audio
[1:36:25] <%ansterdamn> dmc hell is just like daedric lords, they all have different regions
[1:36:26] <ChloeFleurage> Every copy of hell is personalized
[1:36:39] <beefomkers> @thecutethulhu Don't kid yourself :(
[1:36:40] <Spudnacious_Dynasty> This is north hell.
[1:36:44] <%tux_3do> i always imagined hell would be as varied as it is in devil may cry, because hell is meant to be as large as normal existence anyway so why would it be so monotone, you know
[1:36:44] <TheAntiNihilist> hey Pat do you like Baldur being in this game or would you prefer a new Sage?
[1:36:48] <moonmintparadise> COOL DEMON !
[1:36:49] <+Over_ninek> the DMC system is way better
[1:36:50] <+thecosmicfly> Why does hell have Destiny 2 doritos
[1:36:50] <%Mendin> forward and back, and then forward and back
[1:36:55] <jorniev> CAT DIG!?
[1:36:57] <%tux_3do> oh look the second most bullshit demon in the game
[1:37:02] <$Mr_Bop> Hidden missions are my least favorite part or character action games.
[1:37:05] <jorniev> I MEAN CAT DOG!?
[1:37:05] <+snorlaxbud> zoneRage zoneRage
[1:37:08] <KinduVborrd> The backtracking for secret mission stuff is annoying
[1:37:11] <KingKrampus> the heck is there a two head cerberus
[1:37:13] <%Mendin> Grace and Glory?
[1:37:14] <Mangahero18> ITS BLADE WOLF FROM METAL GEAR.
[1:37:15] <+Over_ninek> Stand here and look that way feels way better
[1:37:33] <%Mendin> @KingKrampus Orthrus
[1:37:39] <ullyzeez> the dog ones
[1:37:40] <KingKrampus> why does it look like a Beast Machines transformer
[1:37:42] <%tux_3do> allegiance?
[1:37:51] <huskarl_zap> Vergil the angel came to Dante to show him through hell and all he would say is "YIPPIE WA HOO PIZZA"
[1:37:52] <KingKrampus> yeah that thing @mendin
[1:37:56] <KinduVborrd> Especially when they get counted for permanently damaging you, or they're counted for overall mission score so you're punished for not doing them
[1:38:04] <koffeemancer> It reminds me of that one boss you fight in Onimusha 3
[1:38:18] <ullyzeez> grace and glory are the only ones that need to be remembered
[1:38:28] <%Mendin> His big brother Cerberus gets all the screentime, nobody remembers poor Orthrus
[1:38:36] <beefomkers> Dante's inferno but Dante has anime powers
[1:38:41] <+Gespens> Hey, Joy was pretty memorable in Bayo 1
[1:38:47] <huskarl_zap> Bayonetta hell = ITS JUST VENICE AGAIN
[1:38:49] <Mangahero18> Werent they called Alfheim in the first game?
[1:38:50] <%ansterdamn> why is bayo so fucking cool man like seriously
[1:38:56] <%tux_3do> joy was the best angel of bayo 1
[1:38:58] <KinduVborrd> When is Capcom going to be porting the other Onimusha games and God Hand and Viewtiful Joe, YOU FUCKS?
[1:39:13] <%tux_3do> for obviously gameplay related reasons
[1:39:19] <%TaurusOxford> evoRekt
[1:39:28] <beefomkers> Dante eats pizza because his namesake is italian
[1:39:39] <ChloeFleurage> how many more until easy mode is selectable
[1:39:44] <%Mendin> Shinji Makami does not believe we are worthy of a God Hand port
[1:39:47] <KinduVborrd> I don't like Joy's lasers, but they're otherwise really fun
[1:39:48] <%Mendin> After that 3.0 review
[1:39:49] <Oxybe> Ancient biblical Glock
[1:40:00] <%Mendin> He is probably STILL mad
[1:40:01] <KinduVborrd> Easy mode is selectable from the beginning in Bayp
[1:40:04] <KinduVborrd> Bayo
[1:40:14] <ChloeFleurage> woosh
[1:40:18] <KingKrampus> I still say you can make a Bayo/DMC style game with like, Shepherd Belmont!Jesus
[1:40:25] <huskarl_zap> Yes the divine comedy was about pizza receipts
[1:40:25] <KinduVborrd> I'm still mad too
[1:40:26] <beefomkers> cool cool cool
[1:40:43] <beefomkers> @kingkrampus I would buy that
[1:40:52] <KingKrampus> let Jesus whip the sin out of demons
[1:41:10] <%Mendin> Gentlemen have you ever heard of El Shaddai
[1:41:15] <beefomkers> There is nothing more divinely comedic than wacky woo hoo pizza
[1:41:17] <KingKrampus> and like, actual canon Jesus, not American Fanon Jesus
[1:41:25] <%Mendin> where fabled biblical saintprophet guy Enoch goes and beats up a bunch of fallen angels
[1:41:28] <Ner234> Good
[1:41:28] <%tux_3do> wholesome
[1:41:32] <beefomkers> Yeah I know
[1:41:36] <+thecutethulhu> No apologies, it's god.
[1:41:36] <+OwlLightningMage> How dare you love that sweet doggo
[1:41:38] <B1ak3N1k05999> Great job
[1:41:38] <KinduVborrd> And thus the lord crafted the double-barreled shotgun, and gave it to his angels to protect his realm
[1:41:39] <+fockniapo> mmm
[1:41:42] <+fockniapo> she gets naked
[1:41:42] <+OwlLightningMage> You monster
[1:41:43] <huskarl_zap> Enoch "WAHOO CHILLI DOGS"
[1:41:46] <beefomkers> The final boss is Satan in the desert
[1:41:49] <KingKrampus> @mendin i am buying El Shaddai the moment it comes on steam
[1:41:51] <KinduVborrd> Please keep petting his dog
[1:41:55] <+thecosmicfly> Off cam degeneracy
[1:41:55] <%BallerSwagBro9k> WOOLIE
[1:42:00] <beefomkers> Because they have children to take care of instead
[1:42:08] <%Mendin> @KingKrampus Same
[1:42:09] <+fockniapo> I cannot own dogs or cats (super allergic) I had a sschanuzer mix
[1:42:14] <MsVcol> I'm allergic to my cat, I still love the terrible gremlin
[1:42:21] <+OwlLightningMage> LUL
[1:42:21] <Ner234> Pat wtf D:
[1:42:22] <SCIENCE_25> Their's a difference between adoring and OBSESSING over your pets.
[1:42:23] <Ner234> LUL
[1:42:27] <%Kirby_Sauce> sometimes you inherit a pet pat
[1:42:27] <KinduVborrd> What if my cat keeps destroying my shit? I love him, but he keeps destroying my electronics
[1:42:29] <KingKrampus> @mendin like I have it on Xbox 360, but I never finished it
[1:42:30] <%Valdorick> Dogs are the worst #CatLyfe
[1:42:31] <$Mr_Bop> its just a dog pat
[1:42:36] <%Kirby_Sauce> previous owner dies
[1:42:37] <+OwlLightningMage> Didn't YOU hate cats until Emlo?
[1:42:39] <jessicaaquin0> @SCIENCE_25 yup
[1:42:40] <+RandyFistburgers> Or allergic, I can understand that too. Kind of
[1:42:43] <%BallerSwagBro9k> Every time I see a dog or cat it takes every fiber of my being to not hug them non stop
[1:42:44] <huskarl_zap> Woolie needs to tell us about chili dogs in babylon in the book of enoch
[1:42:48] <+fockniapo> electronics are like an amusement park for pets
[1:42:49] <beefomkers> Dog gang rise up
[1:42:54] <SasquatchFinding> your animal companion is like another best friend
[1:42:54] <+OwlLightningMage> Fair
[1:42:57] <DianaTheAscian> no
[1:42:58] <%Alazull> yes
[1:43:00] <%SaiyanShoto> If you don’t like animals in general you’re a bad person
[1:43:02] <%Mendin> I think Woolie audibled on a podcast 2-3 weeks ago that when El Shaddai's port comes out, he's going in
[1:43:04] <tubit> no
[1:43:05] <%SaiyanShoto> You can love both
[1:43:11] <%Mendin> for the ultimate bibble beat em up
[1:43:19] <KingKrampus> chili dogs in Babylon @huskarl_zap ?? is that some sonic x Bible apocrypha
[1:43:19] <+OwlLightningMage> My first cat was terrible. My second cat was a love bug
[1:43:20] <+RandyFistburgers> Exactly
[1:43:24] <beefomkers> For company
[1:43:25] <SasquatchFinding> it's not something you can understand until you have a bond of your own with an animal
[1:43:28] <huskarl_zap> Poisonous deadly spider gang rise ShowOfHands
[1:43:31] <%danarchist_rex> hell yeah early AF lit
[1:43:31] <%tux_3do> i hate when people say they dont like cats because of bitchy cats they met on the street, like what'd you expect do you think random human strangers to be super friendly on sight to you?

[1:44:11] <%mikessdd> Yeah I’ve known a lot of people with psycho cats where even their owners didn’t pet them.
[1:44:11] <huskarl_zap> lol
[1:44:17] <%Mendin> Ugh and now I'm thinkibng about that fucking Angra Mainyu fight
[1:44:25] <%WholesomeSandwhichPeddler> Where’s the giant eyeball?
[1:44:29] <SasquatchFinding> GAWRSH SORA ITS THE DARKNESS
[1:44:30] <%Mendin> Where everyone dies because you have to juggle like three different instakill mechanics
[1:44:32] <huskarl_zap> I thought you meant Vampire the Masquerade
[1:44:34] <KingKrampus> that what fight @mendin
[1:44:35] <KinduVborrd> My first dog bit my dad so he had to go
[1:44:36] <$Mr_Bop> angra is a dickbag.
[1:44:41] <%tux_3do> i also cant get over pat not like ff3, like how??
[1:44:45] <+snorlaxbud> piss walls
[1:44:46] <%danarchist_rex> This game is gorgeous
[1:44:47] <+RandyFistburgers> Some cats are just spiteful pricks though
[1:44:50] <%Mendin> In FFXIV @KingKrampus
[1:44:54] <%tux_3do> *not liking
[1:44:58] <%Alazull> @patstaresat speaking of which how did you like new eden fights?
[1:44:59] <%mikessdd> Never had that issue with any of my cats though. Hell. One of my current cats. Was born being super antisocial. And he came around eventually.
[1:45:00] <Slicerv> zaqHi morning people
[1:45:04] <KingKrampus> isnt angrah mainyu another name for ahriman
[1:45:06] <+OwlLightningMage> FF3 is decent. Pat is wrong
[1:45:15] <beefomkers> "Did I hear you fella's talking about the door to Darkness?" -Keyblade Master Mickey Mouse
[1:45:23] <$Mr_Bop> @kingkrampus basically a big one yeah
[1:45:30] <%Mendin> Ahura Mazda and Angra Mainyu are the God/Devil analogues in Zoroastrianism
[1:45:32] <mortificent> Kreygasm Kreygasm Kreygasm
[1:45:36] <bettysharkface> So we still in hell or something what's happening, does it even matter if I know?
[1:45:36] <huskarl_zap> Kreygasm platinum community jar Kreygasm
[1:45:42] <%tizz86> tizz86 gifted a Tier 1 sub to beefomkers! They have given 410 Gift Subs in the channel! 
[1:45:42] <MsVcol> are you saying this game is FUN!? UNACCEPTABLE
[1:45:45] <KingKrampus> yeah yeah @mendin
[1:45:49] <BluBox> D:
[1:45:50] <TheAntiNihilist> no for the poses
[1:45:51] <%Kirby_Sauce> WHIFF
[1:45:54] <Mangahero18> Lesse...do you think;
[1:45:54] <%tux_3do> yeah the biggest problem with bayo 2's combat is that umbran climax is objectively the best option, while magic and torture attacks just are forgotten
[1:45:59] <KingKrampus> that's why I liked the 2016 Prince of Persia
[1:46:04] <KinduVborrd> I like fun video games
[1:46:07] <Mangahero18> We'll get a bayo costume in MHR?
[1:46:12] <DianaTheAscian> @PatStaresAt Pat is ff1 worth playing?
[1:46:17] <huskarl_zap> pat "Snuff for the funsies"
[1:46:17] <$Mr_Bop> but umbran climax cool
[1:46:18] <%tux_3do> less variety in combat
[1:46:20] <%Dakuu75> you can ABSOLUTELY tell when someone is a gamer because they look UNDER the edge of the floating platforms for secrets
[1:46:21] <SaltyAzteca> CHARLES GET OUT
[1:46:23] <%beefomkers> I hate fun video games
[1:46:23] <+RyTYoung> LUL LUL LUL
[1:46:25] <KinduVborrd> I would like magic to have more viable options in Bayo in general
[1:46:27] <+thecutethulhu> "AAAAAAAAARGH! Oh, right."
[1:46:27] <%tux_3do> ff1 is solid
[1:46:29] <%Mekhet09> Sure.
[1:46:31] <Mangahero18> no
[1:46:31] <%CapnClassix> Play it on PSP
[1:46:32] <%Mekhet09> It's simple.
[1:46:35] <Mega_Driver> play the PS1 version of FF1 and 2
[1:46:36] <BluBox> Sure, more worth it than 2
[1:46:37] <Mangahero18> skip straight to ff3
[1:46:38] <%tux_3do> its mostly just a dnd fanfic but yeah play it
[1:46:40] <bettysharkface> [screams geometrically]
[1:46:47] <%ansterdamn> its a pointy orb
[1:46:47] <TheAntiNihilist> NO
[1:46:50] <KingKrampus> Golems? there's Judaism in Bayonetta verseM
[1:46:51] <%Mekhet09> Skip to 4 you mean.
[1:46:52] <%Kirby_Sauce> beyblade
[1:46:54] <%Mekhet09> Three sucks.
[1:47:01] <%Mendin> Skip straight to 5
[1:47:06] <+fizuth> I just woke up and pat is streaming???
[1:47:10] <DianaTheAscian> oh god beyblade
[1:47:11] <+thecosmicfly> Now this is just a Destiny ghost
[1:47:14] <%Mendin> 4's ok but 5 is when it gets good
[1:47:18] <$Mr_Bop> Pat, how do I learn to dodge offset?
[1:47:19] <TheAntiNihilist> start with 4
[1:47:20] <%tux_3do> 1 and 3 are solid, but 4 is the first final fantasy CLASSIC
[1:47:21] <KinduVborrd> Play what interests you and if you don't like it, move on
[1:47:24] <+thecosmicfly> OK nvm
[1:47:25] <KingKrampus> final fantasy 9 best ff
[1:47:30] <%beefomkers> You get to fight and entire army of rabbis in Bayonetta 3 I hear
[1:47:31] <%mikessdd> FF1 is great. I would only really suggest the psp or gba versions though.
[1:47:32] <SCIENCE_25> It's a transforming draedyl.
[1:47:35] <Mangahero18> skip straight to 9
[1:47:37] <TheAntiNihilist> 5 is great but 4 is a great tutorial
[1:47:37] <SaltyAzteca> FF2 is great tho...
[1:47:41] <Mangahero18> 7 and 8 suck balls
[1:47:47] <+OwlLightningMage> Play 13. it's the best one Kappa
[1:47:49] <dinnydanny777> Is FF4 good?
[1:47:50] <%tux_3do> imo VI is the magnum opus
[1:47:53] <KingKrampus> 9 best ff, followed by 8 then 10
[1:47:57] <%Kirby_Sauce> i remember the sword being good against golem
[1:47:59] <dinnydanny777> Cecil was pretty cool in Dissidia
[1:48:01] <mortificent> 9 is boring
[1:48:06] <%beefomkers> No
[1:48:06] <%luckypineapple> I'm playing FFX for the first time, and I am having a blast
[1:48:09] <afroking1124> 9's my fav
[1:48:11] <Mangahero18> None of them are good. Play Dragon Quest.
[1:48:12] <Vcom7418> GBA version is apparently legit good
[1:48:16] <DianaTheAscian> k
[1:48:18] <KingKrampus> @mortificent how dare you
[1:48:31] <%Alazull> If you have the free time FF1 is interesting
[1:48:32] <+baldur09> the psp version is good
[1:48:34] <dinnydanny777> 12 is alright
[1:48:34] <+OwlLightningMage> Just play Bravely Default.
[1:48:34] <%beefomkers> I do (not)
[1:48:38] <KinduVborrd> Wait wait, how did we get here?
[1:48:40] <%Dakuu75> I thought we were in hell, wtf is this???
[1:48:52] <B1ak3N1k05999> Is this the place
[1:48:56] <mortificent> @kingkrampus 9 never clicked with me like 7 and 6 did
[1:48:58] <KingKrampus> why is that child english
[1:48:58] <%Mekhet09> Ew I wouldn't wish bravely default on my worst enemy.
[1:48:59] <dinnydanny777> Is this Heaven and Hell?
[1:49:02] <Mangahero18> This is the Hell for Rich White People.
[1:49:03] <%wibbwobbler> ff starts at 4 imo
[1:49:06] <+thecutethulhu> Oh yeah, this is the first couple of stages in Bayo 1.
[1:49:10] <+OwlLightningMage> Half of Bravely Default is better than almost every early FF game
[1:49:11] <Mangahero18> Rich Hell if you will.
[1:49:13] <%Kirby_Sauce> waste
[1:49:13] <huskarl_zap> Hero of light is a giga chad that fucks all the femboys like women
[1:49:19] <KingKrampus> @mortificent okay fair, 7 never clicked with me
[1:49:21] <%tux_3do> FFIX is what you play if you want to experience what people back in the 80s felt FFI was like
[1:49:26] <saiyanblitz> How is Luka able to leave these journals
[1:49:26] <%Mendin> Rising from the ground with his arms crossed
[1:49:27] <bettysharkface> Shiny boy
[1:49:28] <SaltyAzteca> STOMACHFACE
[1:49:29] <%Mendin> Like a baller
[1:49:30] <jorniev> FAST
[1:49:32] <$Mr_Bop> bravely default is ugly though
[1:49:33] <KinduVborrd> These guys look cool,
[1:49:47] <+thecutethulhu> RIPperoni?
[1:49:47] <%BallerSwagBro9k> @mendin Kappa
[1:49:48] <%Dakuu75> now THAT'S A LOT OF DAMAGE
[1:49:54] <KinduVborrd> Super Galaxy Gurren Lagann!!
[1:49:58] <Ner234> @Mr_Bop D:
[1:49:59] <Manipulator98> he got funnels
[1:50:00] <%luckypineapple> FF16 looks so fucking generic
[1:50:01] <mortificent> man, I wish Final Fantasy did a proper space opera instead of going back to medieval
[1:50:03] <%Dakuu75> Flex-tape can't fix that.
[1:50:06] <dinnydanny777> Chat is Final Fantasy 3 good? I never hear anyone talk about it like eve
[1:50:09] <SaltyAzteca> BibleThump
[1:50:10] <ClutchSuts> If they could bottle Bayonetta's voice I'd buy it
[1:50:10] <+OwlLightningMage> This enemy sucks
[1:50:11] <dinnydanny777> ever*
[1:50:16] <%mikessdd> FF9 was like going back to basic in terms of story. A lot more similarities to the 2D ffs and it’s on purpose.
[1:50:19] <+OwlLightningMage> FF3 is decent
[1:50:21] <KingKrampus> anyone else think it weird that there's a Greek mythology centaur as a Beast Machine's angel
[1:50:23] <%Kirby_Sauce> git good
[1:50:23] <+BIumen> but the DS remake :(
[1:50:24] <+OwlLightningMage> Pat is wrong
[1:50:27] <%fizuth> I like final fantasy 3
[1:50:27] <%tux_3do> 3 is NOWHERE NEAR as bad as 2, jesus
[1:50:28] <BluBox> 3 is good, Pat is wrong
[1:50:31] <%Mekhet09> I tried playing it on the DS but I just couldn't.
[1:50:34] <ChloeFleurage> 6 is good tho
[1:50:34] <KinduVborrd> FF3 is fine, But FF5 refines the combat system way more
[1:50:36] <citerel> 3 is like proto 5
[1:50:36] <SaltyAzteca> Why is 2 bad, the story was pretty good BibleThump
[1:50:39] <%beefomkers> Start at 4 and skip 8 and the one with lightning
[1:50:40] <+fockniapo> the music is the best aspect from any given final fantasy
[1:50:41] <MsVcol> I like 2, but it's bad
[1:50:44] <dinnydanny777> I remember Dissidia had the FF3 character and called her Onion Knight
[1:50:46] <+fockniapo> fight me
[1:50:47] <+OwlLightningMage> Comparing it to 2 is not fair
[1:50:53] <huskarl_zap> STONE
[1:50:53] <%beefomkers> Which one has Lighting again fuck
[1:50:54] <KingKrampus> I will be honest, ff7 always seemed overhyped to me
[1:50:57] <TheAntiNihilist> @patstaresat do you like that Baldur is in this game or would you have preferred a new Sage? I know he's story important but he doesn't make the story good. a slightly different story would've been better
[1:50:58] <jorniev> WHAT ABOUT 6
[1:50:58] <%Mekhet09> Onion knight was a guy.
[1:51:02] <%fizuth> 2 is a nightmare, 3 is just made kinda obsolete by 5 but is fine
[1:51:03] <ChloeFleurage> onion knight is OP in dissidia
[1:51:04] <$8BitDsx> FF3 is the first Final Fantasy game i completed, the translated NES version. fun times tbh but could be nostalgia.
[1:51:05] <%Srthunda> man, you final fantasy peoples are all crazy
[1:51:07] <dinnydanny777> @fockniapo I can't fight you if I agree with you LUL
[1:51:07] <%Mendin> 13, and 13-2, and 13-3
[1:51:07] <Shardlab> Do not be overcome by nostalgia
[1:51:09] <+OwlLightningMage> 13 has lightning and it's terrible
[1:51:11] <KingKrampus> @beefomkers ff13 had lightning
[1:51:11] <afroking1124> @beefomkers 13
[1:51:17] <KinduVborrd> Pat loves FF6, doesn't he?
[1:51:20] <%tux_3do> @beefomkers i would argue ff8 is a hit-or-miss game rather than just bad, like anyone should try the first few minutes to see if the experimental stuff clicks with them
[1:51:20] <%Mendin> 13-2 and 13-3 would be solid games if they were not FF13 games
[1:51:24] <%beefomkers> 13 is a fitting number
[1:51:24] <%Mendin> Especially 13-3
[1:51:25] <%Dakuu75> FF4 and FF6 are my favorite of the old-classics
[1:51:25] <+OwlLightningMage> Final Fantasy 6 is one of best games ever made
[1:51:29] <mortificent> 75% of FF6 is excellent
[1:51:35] <%mikessdd> 7 IS overhyped but it’s also insanely important to the progress of video games as a medium.
[1:51:47] <%beefomkers> I just don't like the combat system in 8
[1:51:48] <KingKrampus> @tux_3do ff8 is my favorite ff after 9
[1:51:55] <Mangahero18> SPOILERS! We havent actually 100% confirmed its Baldur. Its probablly totally someone else.
[1:51:55] <%luckypineapple> FF7 still holds up so well. People who are say its overrated are just insecure in liking things
[1:51:59] <%beefomkers> and the story is lame
[1:51:59] <huskarl_zap> Avalanche never killed anyone
[1:51:59] <+OwlLightningMage> I really wish we got a remake of 6 before 7
[1:52:01] <$NoctisxMog> @kingkrampus that's why I didn't get into it until the remake came out
[1:52:07] <%Kirby_Sauce> cheer500 gee pat, i don't get why you won't support FF1. outdated and old has to be enjoyable to someone right? I mean, we come to your streams after all.
[1:52:11] <mortificent> I love 6 and 7 and I'd say they are super overhyped
[1:52:13] <%tux_3do> @KingKrampus i dont agree with you but i respect that
[1:52:17] <%Mekhet09> No. It's a decent game but it's not at the level people treat it.
[1:52:22] <KinduVborrd> A remake of 6 would be cool
[1:52:23] <$Mr_Bop> @kirby_sauce nice one
[1:52:26] <%beefomkers> Avalanche regularly killed shinra soldiers
[1:52:35] <dinnydanny777> I played FF7 for the first time in around 2017 and I still enjoyed it a great deal
[1:52:36] <SCIENCE_25> No, I was lookin away. Do it again Pat.
[1:52:37] <%beefomkers> That's the first thing Avalanche does actually
[1:52:38] <KingKrampus> @mikessdd i won't dispute 7's importance historically, but it never gelled with me like 9 and 8 and 10 did
[1:52:43] <KinduVborrd> It's time for opinions and discourse
[1:52:46] <%tux_3do> hot take: 6 deserved the remake more than 7 because 6 aged more poorly than 7
[1:52:50] <%Valdorick> "Do plot!"
[1:52:53] <%thatfeel> A friend of mine tried to get me to play ff13 and he said "don't worry, it gets good 20 hours in"
[1:53:00] <+OwlLightningMage> No one like that
[1:53:06] <B1ak3N1k05999> The nagging
[1:53:09] <%tux_3do> not to mention 6 feels more underrated in the casual rpg discourse
[1:53:10] <TheAntiNihilist> true
[1:53:11] <afroking1124> hurry up, CHRIS!
[1:53:13] <KinduVborrd> Loki, the living arrow from old school Beat 'em Ups
[1:53:13] <SaltyAzteca> Link be like hyaaah!
[1:53:14] <%mikessdd> The problem with 7 is it’s good but there are people that treat it like the undisputed best game in the entire series no matter what came before or after.
[1:53:14] <Mangahero18> @luckypineapple This a wrong opinion. FF7 is VERY MUCH overrated.
[1:53:15] <%Valdorick> "Fucking ignore the level designer's work and just ignore everything! Do it! Do plot and progress bitch!"
[1:53:18] <+Over_ninek> hopefully the platinum crew played God of War at some point
[1:53:22] <KingKrampus> I won ff7 remake in a raffle, I need to play it
[1:53:23] <$8BitDsx> Final Fantasy 13 is one of 2 games i've fallen asleep while playing. I forget the 2nd one tho..
[1:53:24] <+thecosmicfly> [Everybody disliked that]
[1:53:34] <%Dakuu75> yep
[1:53:38] <Akett> God, playing Mahjong in Yakuza is the worst because the NPCs will yell at you to play faster.
[1:53:39] <dinnydanny777> Just like FFXIII and XV then :)
[1:53:44] <%beefomkers> I didn't like the remake that much
[1:53:47] <+OwlLightningMage> 13 has so many problems
[1:53:51] <%tux_3do> like kefka deserves as much love as sephiroth if not more imo
[1:53:54] <%fizuth> I kinda like that about 7 remake, it tells me immediately where not to go if I wanna find secrets
[1:53:57] <%beefomkers> Tifa felt so bland
[1:53:58] <Mangahero18> @8BitDsx Probably a David Cage Game
[1:54:01] <Mangahero18> heyoooo
[1:54:07] <KingKrampus> ff9's Kuja is a better villain than Sephiroth
[1:54:08] <KinduVborrd> Is that in a specific Yakuza or multiple?
[1:54:10] <%beefomkers> Maybe I just remembered her character differently
[1:54:17] <NeroInfinite> I fell asleep toFF14 once but I was REALLY sleepy playing it.
[1:54:23] <Kronark> Most modern video games treat you like an idiot. It's why I appreciate the souls franchise so much.
[1:54:29] <%beefomkers> And Barret was just annoying mostly
[1:54:34] <mortificent> Kefka deserves a lot of love, but I'd say he falls about flat in the second half
[1:54:35] <huskarl_zap> New tifa is tofu old tifa is watermelons
[1:54:44] <%Dakuu75> how many times has Pat gone back to the start of this level? lol
[1:54:46] <Akett> I've seen it done in Yak 7.
[1:54:49] <KinduVborrd> Weapons will run out and never come back though
[1:54:50] <%Chichen> its Calming.
[1:54:52] <afroking1124> its an mmo
[1:54:53] <+blewbeary> they said 13
[1:54:55] <+blewbeary> not 14
[1:54:59] <%ConLin_Arts_> Pat being up as early as a toddler
[1:55:01] <%BallerSwagBro9k> Wow what a good game Kappa Kappa Kappa
[1:55:05] <%Mekhet09> I liked most of 7R but nomuras bullshit. If the whispers are in Part 2 I'm done. I don't want more KH shit.
[1:55:10] <%beefomkers> And they introduced that materia twink who's a completely different artstyle than everyone and everything else around him
[1:55:14] <%tux_3do> another hot take: i dont think a game putting you to sleep is a bad thing if it has a relaxing vibe, untitled goose game puts me to sleep and i love it
[1:55:15] <dinnydanny777> XIII isn't even really bad it's just so boring
[1:55:16] <KingKrampus> @huskarl_zap how is original Tifa watermelons
[1:55:17] <KinduVborrd> Okay
[1:55:20] <+thecutethulhu> You find a spot somewhere in 14 to sit and relax and listen to music and it's just ResidentSleeper
[1:55:20] <%Dakuu75> MHW is very relaxing for me, personally.
[1:55:24] <%beefomkers> Fuck that guy
[1:55:25] <AnneSQF> someone said 13, another person said 14
[1:55:26] <$Mr_Bop> 13 is the most 5/10 game I have ever played
[1:55:30] <%ConLin_Arts_> does anyone like Bayo 2's golems more than Bayo 1's?
[1:55:32] <That_Mojo> me too dakuu
[1:55:33] <%mikessdd> They did say 14 though?
[1:55:34] <@SoFarFetched> original guy said 14 not 13 LUL
[1:55:35] <+OwlLightningMage> I don't trust Nomura to follow up Remake in a satisfactory way
[1:55:38] <@SoFarFetched> one guy is a liar
[1:55:39] <Akett> Dunno about other Yakuza games, I've only gotten into Mahjong since Yak 7 came out. Maybe Kiwami the NPCs rush you?
[1:55:39] <Mangahero18> Ive played 14. It was okay. I just cant get invested in any MMO's for any real periods of time.
[1:55:42] <%Mendin> Just rider kick open the gate to hell
[1:55:48] <+RealPT1> lightning returns is a weird experiment
[1:55:48] <$NoctisxMog> honestly square portraying Cloud after AC did not make me interested in him until remake
[1:55:52] <%ansterdamn> what if bayo and dmc had a crossover?
[1:55:53] <%Valdorick> I remember falling asleep playing Arc The Lad 2, and waking up to being 5 levels higher and 2 chapters ahead of where I was...
[1:55:53] <%beefomkers> I don't trust Nomura
[1:55:55] <huskarl_zap> @kingkrampus because her Tiffos are watermelons
[1:56:02] <SaltyAzteca> Stripper dance for power!!
[1:56:02] <%beefomkers> That's it
[1:56:03] <dinnydanny777> I honestly didn't like 7R and thought the new stuff really clashed with the themes of the story
[1:56:04] <KingKrampus> remake has very "The Infinite Loops" fanfic epic vibes imho
[1:56:07] <huskarl_zap> or just Lara croft triangles
[1:56:07] <%beefomkers> I don't trust him
[1:56:09] <%Valdorick> Don't sleep progress your plot, y'all.
[1:56:15] <jimmytwofeet> BOY HAS POWERS?
[1:56:16] <%Mekhet09> That's my problem Nomura doesn't seem to really know what the fuck made FF7 so popular in the first place.
[1:56:28] <%ConLin_Arts_> I like Nomura, he is neat
[1:56:29] <KinduVborrd> I think I hate people
[1:56:29] <+OwlLightningMage> Bayo and DMC crossing over would be bad. They play so differently that it wouldn't work
[1:56:34] <KingKrampus> anybody know about "The Infinite Loops" fanfic series
[1:56:38] <$NoctisxMog> I'm having a blast with 7R
[1:56:39] <%Kirby_Sauce> i would stay up late playing my ds so often, that now pulling it out makes me lethargic
[1:56:41] <Dave_VD> the remake was so disappointing to me. I'd prefer a bluepoint style remake where almost everything is the same aside from quality of life improvements and modern visuals
[1:56:42] <%Dakuu75> boy has prince-of-persia powers, yes.
[1:56:51] <%Mekhet09> I liked him a lot before KH2.
[1:56:52] <%fizuth> I see that take about the remake alot and I genuinely don't get where it comes from
[1:56:55] <TheAntiNihilist> Bayo 3 needs like 4 new characters to have it maybe be as good as DMCV
[1:56:55] <$Mr_Bop> @mekhet09 well tbf no one really seems to know. Not even the fans
[1:56:55] <%mikessdd> Falling asleep during msq roulette is super normal apparently. I did it once and felt embarrassed but I guess it happens to people a lot.
[1:56:59] <%beefomkers> Nomura has had his brain scrambled from working on Kingdom Hearts so he forgot how to make a normal story that isn't borderline schizophrenic psychobabble
[1:56:59] <AnneSQF> monsters? in my battle arena?!
[1:57:02] <dinnydanny777> I'd been trying to replay 7R and everytime I just get annoyed with it and quit ngl, I don't want to replay it at all
[1:57:17] <%tux_3do> @beefomkers I remember a quote Nomura once said 'the most important quality I want in my stories is to be surprising', which means that ff7 remake part 2 could easily go the mass effect 3 or game of thrones season 8 route where coherence is sacrificed for shock value. thats my hunch anyway
[1:57:19] <huskarl_zap> What if Gene is down here in a jar infinitely filling with yellow platinum water?
[1:57:20] <%luckypineapple> I find that people are criticizing Remake for flaws it hasn't done yet, but just assume will happen cause Nomura
[1:57:20] <%fizuth> FF7 is popular because of its characters. Like, anyone with eyes can see that, and the remake executes them beautifully so far
[1:57:26] <%Kirby_Sauce> found the ff7 purists
[1:57:46] <%beefomkers> @tux_3do Fuck you're right
[1:57:50] <SaltyAzteca> getting plats is hard
[1:57:50] <%beefomkers> I'm angry
[1:57:52] <%Dakuu75> what does the moon-of-w/e do?
[1:57:52] <+OwlLightningMage> it's almost like people actually wanted a remake to game and not more Nomura bullshit
[1:57:58] <KinduVborrd> Never mind, I know I hate people
[1:57:59] <%tux_3do> @beefomkers ;_;
[1:57:59] <%beefomkers> angry about VIDEOGAMES
[1:58:01] <+Aluxary> aluxarAluxarykittycat aluxarAluxarykittycat aluxarAluxarykittycat
[1:58:04] <afroking1124> tifa was super anime in the remake
[1:58:05] <$8BitDsx> I started FF7R, then remembered that it's technically only part of it, and then shelved it until the later releases. It bothers me so much.
[1:58:07] <KinduVborrd> Moon increases max magic
[1:58:09] <%ConLin_Arts_> FF7 original is a product of its time, it does need much more than just better grampfix
[1:58:13] <%luckypineapple> @tux_3do I think you are reading too much into things
[1:58:16] <Mangahero18> Nomura is kinda like Kojima. He doesnt know how to make anything but pretentious nonsense anymore. FF7R2 is where the same rot that ruined KH is gonna start creeping in you mark my words.
[1:58:18] <%Mekhet09> Yeah. I'd have been fine with altering the story if it wasn't part of the nomura bullshit.
[1:58:31] <%ConLin_Arts_> like the story is so stout and compact that things only get fleshed out through text
[1:58:32] <mortificent> god, I just remembered how much I absolutely forget about a quarter of FF6's cast
[1:58:34] <%beefomkers> Tifa is nothing fucking japanese zoomers have such shit taste
[1:58:36] <%Kirby_Sauce> yes pat
[1:58:37] <dinnydanny777> @luckypineapple I think the first part has many flaws, I think the battle system has some flaws and I think the story already has many flaws from a writing point of view
[1:58:41] <%tux_3do> @luckypineapple i hope so
[1:58:44] <%Kirby_Sauce> you can ride the pony
[1:58:44] <+RyTYoung> YEYEYEYE
[1:58:45] <AnneSQF> we monster hunter rise now, boys
[1:58:49] <%Mekhet09> Kojima doesn't remake games though.
[1:58:51] <$8BitDsx> WYVERN RIDING
[1:58:56] <%DooWopShaBop> Why did Pat start streaming at 5 AM?
[1:58:57] <ThatGuyThere03> sick
[1:59:02] <%ConLin_Arts_> Twin Snakes
[1:59:03] <%beefomkers> Why do you want your fake videogame girlfriend to all have the same personality fuck
[1:59:05] <MsVcol> would bayonetta say poggers
[1:59:09] <%ConLin_Arts_> was a remake
[1:59:11] <+OwlLightningMage> let's shove Sephy into every fucking scene because it's a Nomura game
[1:59:21] <%beefomkers> Aerith is 100x better
[1:59:36] <%beefomkers> Sephiroth is important you see
[1:59:45] <%Mekhet09> That annoyed the fuck out of me so did the president shinra scene.
[1:59:45] <%ConLin_Arts_> Budgetnetta
[1:59:45] <+ekodrop> shenanigans like streaming at 7am
[1:59:50] <KinduVborrd> Money is very expensive
[1:59:50] <Kronark> I would agree with that. The FF7 remake actually made me like Aerith.
[1:59:52] <%luckypineapple> Whenever people talk about creators like they know them, its a good idication that person does not know what they are talking about
[1:59:56] <%beefomkers> He's an edgier character than we've ever had - Nomura
[1:59:59] <%Mekhet09> That added nothing to the game and retroactively tried to ruin the original.
[2:00:04] <SaltyAzteca> Reduce, reuse, recycle
[2:00:09] <huskarl_zap> Aerith is stank ass horse girl that most def has an sdi
[2:00:11] <+OwlLightningMage> The villian needs to always be around every corner to remind they exist. Don't write for the villain, just have them stand around a exist
[2:00:21] <afroking1124> zack > cloud dont @ me
[2:00:22] <%tux_3do> @luckypineapple that being said, we cant deny that the level design of midgar is disappointingly linear, the aerial combat is one dimensional, and sephiroth appears too much to be as silently intimidating as in the original. there are flaws right in front of us without worrying over a sequel that doesnt exist yet. im still hopeful tho
[2:00:27] <+Over_ninek> Over under on whether or not Bayonetta 3 will reuse assets from 1
[2:00:32] <%thatfeel> People are pretty passionate about FF7, huh
[2:00:33] <%ConLin_Arts_> what are you on about? the original is still out there and gets put on every single console

[2:01:36] <%ConLin_Arts_> I liked 7R's Midgar way more than FF7 OG's Midgar, Midgar was nothing in the original

[2:01:42] <+ekodrop> fuck, pat has gonorrhea?
[2:01:43] <Mangahero18> @luckypineapple So you are insinuating that you have to know someone personally to form salient opinions of them eh? Please tell us your opinions of your close personal friend Mr Kojima then.
[2:01:49] <mortificent> Celes is worst girl
[2:01:49] <KinduVborrd> My mother is bad
[2:01:50] <Kronark> This is why Barret is my waifu. He wouldn't do me dirty.
[2:01:50] <SaltyAzteca> Lightning, more like,Shitening DansGame
[2:01:52] <huskarl_zap> Curses once = diseased
[2:01:53] <+thecutethulhu> I'll say it: Lulu from FF10 can step on me.
[2:01:56] <sendart> wait pat fucked your waifu?
[2:01:57] <Dave_VD> I'm like half-way through P5r and its my first persona. Makoto is #1 easy right now
[2:01:59] <+OwlLightningMage> Never
[2:01:59] <afroking1124> you smash then pass
[2:02:00] <%beefomkers> Then they aren't a horse girl
[2:02:01] <ThatGuyThere03> no
[2:02:03] <dinnydanny777> Even worse, don't trust a hot horse girl
[2:02:04] <%Dakuu75> PAT STOP! DON'T BAIT THEM
[2:02:04] <%ConLin_Arts_> Is Paige a skeleton horse girl?
[2:02:05] <%Kirby_Sauce> i thought paige was a horse girl?
[2:02:09] <+Gespens> Uma Musume is a fun show tho
[2:02:10] <LastnameSilverLastname> NEVER trust a horse girl.
[2:02:10] <+OwlLightningMage> NEVER trust a horse girl
[2:02:11] <%Monkeyweed21> Makoto sucks
[2:02:12] <%beefomkers> Hot girls do not become horse hirlsy
[2:02:12] <%luckypineapple> @tux_3do Thank you for that incredible insight that the most linear of the OG FF7 is also linear in the Remake. Aerial combat sucks ass tho
[2:02:12] <JesterEgbert> the waifu wars start nooooowwwwwwwww
[2:02:14] <%beefomkers> girls
[2:02:17] <afroking1124> same
[2:02:19] <pebblypirate> did anyone actually believe that aerith was selling literal flowers when playing through FFVII
[2:02:21] <@SoFarFetched> she got decapitated
[2:02:21] <TheAntiNihilist> what if they're PART horse?
[2:02:24] <@SoFarFetched> don't drink and drive
[2:02:28] <Ner234> LUL
[2:02:30] <scorpio990> atpRtsd
[2:02:35] <Mangahero18> Horse Girls fuck da horses
[2:02:35] <%deathofghosts> he said "trust" not "fuck" a horse girl
[2:02:36] <%beefomkers> You're Canadian so she probably looked like a beaver or a moose or some syrup or something
[2:02:37] <Commander_Deko> in what way do you mean "compete"
[2:02:37] <Akett> What if they let you ride them?
[2:02:38] <%Movemeister> LUL
[2:02:39] <%Mekhet09> Makoto was last for me tbh. She really took over that plot at the detriment of everyone else.
[2:02:43] <%blankwaffle> the horse girl at my school got kicked in the face by her horse
[2:02:43] <%Alazull> Wouldnt she be a chocobo girl
[2:02:43] <HelluvaNohbody> Didn't she die?
[2:02:44] <DianaTheAscian> @PatStaresAt is that the one that lost her head?
[2:02:50] <%Kirby_Sauce> you guys remember the horse girl musical movies?
[2:02:52] <LastnameSilverLastname> I mean yeah you can fuck them, but never trust them.
[2:02:53] <@SoFarFetched> Lessons about being a horse girl: Don't drink and drive, PERIOD
[2:02:56] <afroking1124> this man read too many doujins
[2:02:58] <BlackMage66652> You can hit the back though, so you might've been able to compete with the horses @PatStaresAt
[2:03:00] <ThatGuyThere03> get 8 hours of drugs
[2:03:02] <huskarl_zap> How does a bar wench like Tifa not have a choker?
[2:03:03] <SaltyAzteca> "Deadbeat dads are not cool"
[2:03:03] <cloakofashes> In this message, I will elaborately detail why my ship - I mean waifu - is the best and why your favorite waifu is the worst.
[2:03:06] <+OwlLightningMage> Don't drink and drive
[2:03:08] <%Alazull> Jesus
[2:03:08] <%thatfeel> Jesus
[2:03:09] <AnneSQF> rough
[2:03:09] <KinduVborrd> Jesus Christ dude
[2:03:09] <saiyanblitz> I’m confused what are we talking about?
[2:03:11] <KinduVborrd> DUDE
[2:03:12] <+Gespens> WutFace
[2:03:13] <+animaturgy> oof
[2:03:14] <%ConLin_Arts_> let's say this, people are allowed to love the FF7 Remake and people are allowed to love FF7 OG, and that is ok!
[2:03:15] <HarmlessCrow> monkaS
[2:03:16] <powerprotoman> yeah your shorter now
[2:03:16] <KinduVborrd> Pat
[2:03:16] <theanora1> oh man, something that isn't doom scrolling twitter, Sup, Pat
[2:03:17] <%Valdorick> How are we defining horse girls? Girls who own horses? Girls who look like horses? Girls who ARE horses?
[2:03:18] <dinnydanny777> That's awful
[2:03:19] <Mangahero18> STRAPPY YOUNG LAD PAT
[2:03:25] <KingKrampus> I had to take my dog out what i miss
[2:03:25] <Mangahero18> FULL OF PISS AND VINEGAR
[2:03:28] <ThatGuyThere03> Didn't you used to play basketball Pat?
[2:03:29] <%Mekhet09> Did you ever look fit pat?
[2:03:29] <Commander_Deko> but you will be
[2:03:30] <%tux_3do> @luckypineapple i know the level design in midgar was also linear, but there was an opportunity to expand it here which is what im disappointed by. this is also what i expected from the game since they did it with wall market
[2:03:30] <%ConLin_Arts_> Stout
[2:03:32] <%Valdorick> YOU WILL BE ONE DAY PAT
[2:03:32] <%beefomkers> Tifa is a classy lady/ ecoterrorist
[2:03:33] <%Monkeyweed21> yes you are
[2:03:33] <+Yautjabutts> Yautjabutts subscribed with Prime. They've subscribed for 14 months! you get shorter as you age.
[2:03:33] <afroking1124> i mean you might be pat
[2:03:33] <%Srthunda> you cant prove that
[2:03:34] <KinduVborrd> That is a person you knew that died
[2:03:37] <KingKrampus> I was a horse lad
[2:03:38] <+OwlLightningMage> I just hate Nomura
[2:03:39] <%Valdorick> Old age shrinks ALL
[2:03:42] <huskarl_zap> Did she drive by the point?
[2:03:44] <%ConLin_Arts_> first try
[2:03:48] <%augusta_wind> i used to be a horse girl
[2:03:49] <KingKrampus> still am actually
[2:03:53] <$NoctisxMog> @conlin_arts_ thank you
[2:03:56] <@SoFarFetched> It's not a 7am conversation if chat's already bickering and horse girls are in the equation
[2:03:59] <SaltyAzteca> THATS A PP
[2:04:09] <%mikessdd> People are allowed to like what they like and shouldn’t worry about it too much? Yeah I can drink to that.
[2:04:12] <KingKrampus> still love MLP despite never identifying as a brony
[2:04:13] <%tux_3do> @luckypineapple or by how much the npc chatter was fleshed out
[2:04:15] <+OwlLightningMage> I'm not even that invested in FF7. I just think everything Nomura touches turns to shit
[2:04:22] <%Valdorick> Yeah, why can't we argue about something important, like how likely pat is to shit himself this stream?
[2:04:25] <%beefomkers> @tux_3do But you don't understand sephiroth is so scary and he fucks with cloud and there are ghost figures it's awesome come on man
[2:04:28] <%DooWopShaBop> I remember people calling some orange skin tan girl in my high school horse girl
[2:04:30] <Dave_VD> The real problem with 7R is that regardless of whether you enjoy it or not it's clear that they are never gong to adapt the whole story. After maybe one or two more entries it will get canned
[2:04:32] <mortificent> I hope the FF dev teams rotate between Nomura, 14 team and hopefully Yoko Taro someday
[2:04:40] <ThatGuyThere03> what framerate is this running at?
[2:04:41] <koffeemancer> Did Pat get the second part of the Angel Lp?
[2:04:43] <%ConLin_Arts_> Pat will shit his pants one day
[2:04:48] <powerprotoman> jolly roger bay
[2:04:54] <%luckypineapple> @Dave_VD I found it. This is the dumbest take
[2:04:56] <Commander_Deko> did you hate swimming monster hunter as well
[2:05:04] <KinduVborrd> It depends on how late into his life Pat continues streaming
[2:05:08] <%DooWopShaBop> When is Kingdom Hearts 3?
[2:05:09] <+OwlLightningMage> Swimming levels suck
[2:05:10] <HarmlessCrow> It's only a matter of time before Pat shits his pants
[2:05:14] <afroking1124> i cant wait till im 35 to finish ff7R. im 26 btw
[2:05:15] <+OwlLightningMage> Pat is correct
[2:05:16] <HarmlessCrow> And then he will lose all his power
[2:05:19] <Mangahero18> @Dave_VD True. By the time FF7R3 would have come out we'll all be living in underground bunkers.
[2:05:19] <KingKrampus> I just want a classy BBW heroine in a game is that so much to ask as a chubby chaser
[2:05:19] <$Mr_Bop> Ys had a pretty good water level once.
[2:05:22] <mortificent> god, I seriously hope Yoko Taro makes an FF gane
[2:05:22] <%beefomkers> He cannot
[2:05:23] <HelluvaNohbody> What about singing levels
[2:05:23] <$NoctisxMog> chat needs to go to bed
[2:05:26] <%tux_3do> @beefomkers SEPHIROTH 3.0 YOU CAN (NOT) REMAKE
[2:05:27] <redial_nick> water is for fishing ninigames only
[2:05:27] <%Valdorick> almost called out
[2:05:27] <defusedbox> how are you feeling about Bayo2 so far pat?
[2:05:28] <Akett> Majora's Mask swimming was great.
[2:05:28] <Shardlab> Everyone Hated underwater combat in monster hunter.
[2:05:31] <%ConLin_Arts_> psaLiz People knew that the first remake was only Midgar
[2:05:32] <$Mr_Bop> it just worked like a normal level with good music
[2:05:32] <%mikessdd> But but. First person harpoon gameplay was where dmc peaked.
[2:05:33] <Djinnazz> @Dave_VD ??
[2:05:33] <@SoFarFetched> someone was saying FF7R will never get finished and just get canned
[2:05:37] <KinduVborrd> They said 7R will never get finished, Pat
[2:05:43] <ThatGuyThere03> they said it's "obvious" they're not gonna adapt all the parts of FF7's story
[2:05:49] <Tomschiii> it was pretty good
[2:05:51] <%Monkeyweed21> I liked it
[2:05:51] <huskarl_zap> Bayo 3 will control completely under water because it takes place in atlantis
[2:05:54] <+OwlLightningMage> Underwater is the worse thing to happen to video game design LUL
[2:05:55] <Shardlab> And if you say you liked underwater combat in monster hunter, you've been stockholmed bad
[2:05:55] <KinduVborrd> Even though it'll make a gajillion dollars
[2:05:56] <%deathofghosts> yeah but the Ceadues was cool
[2:05:58] <%beefomkers> @conlin_arts_ But midgar wasn't even good
[2:05:58] <%ConLin_Arts_> the beard dragon in 3 had a good theme
[2:06:00] <+Over_ninek> i almost didnt get into monster hunter because of the underwater combat
[2:06:00] <dinnydanny777> My opinion on FF7R is that while I was playing it I kept feeling like it was like a shiny Hollywood adaptation of a book, there's so much dialogue and atmosphere from the original that isn't there and that bums me out, the combat and characters were good though it just didn't hit what I liked from the original and I'm more hyped for XVI now honestly
[2:06:04] <%beefomkers> It was lame
[2:06:05] <Ner234> The backlash would be INSANE
[2:06:06] <+Gespens> They'd have to release FF14 1.0.0 again!
[2:06:07] <+Over_ninek> glad i gave 4 a shot
[2:06:08] <%ConLin_Arts_> It was better than the OG
[2:06:09] <%luckypineapple> It might TAKE FOREVER but it will get finished
[2:06:14] <mortificent> THEIR MOST PROLIFIC GAME WILL NEVER GET FINISHED
[2:06:15] <$NoctisxMog> square will never let t b at happen
[2:06:19] <+OwlLightningMage> Unless your game is built underwater, it always sucks
[2:06:22] <TheAntiNihilist> @thatguythere03 well of course not. it's a completely new story now. that's what the ending told us
[2:06:26] <KingKrampus> wake me up when there's ff8 r
[2:06:27] <afroking1124> i cant wait for square to kill off aerith then cancel the final part
[2:06:31] <+Kyoshikei> Thanks for straming while firmament is up
[2:06:31] <@SoFarFetched> remember chat: never be main character
[2:06:32] <%SaiyanShoto> Whoever said that is a dumb
[2:06:35] <Mangahero18> IT WILL BURN DOWN...WHEN THE SUN CONSUMES US.
[2:06:36] <KinduVborrd> Like, FFVII content is a button Square can push to make money
[2:06:37] <+ekodrop> dante became a woman
[2:06:38] <KingKrampus> I want a remake of 8 and 9
[2:06:38] <Commander_Deko> @KingKrampus Then sleep eternally
[2:06:39] <@SoFarFetched> always be side character
[2:06:40] <%tux_3do> @dinnydanny777 omg ff7r is the disney live action remake of ff7
[2:06:45] <%Dakuu75> Spyro and Crash games did Underwater levels pretty-ok, imo.
[2:06:46] <%Valdorick> @KingKrampus Ded 4ever
[2:06:50] <%SaiyanShoto> FF8R LUL LUL no one wants that
[2:06:50] <%Kirby_Sauce> problombo
[2:06:51] <Shardlab> You know how you do underwater combat? A regular Starfox 64 level
[2:06:57] <+RealPT1> I did not hate MH3 underwater fighting
[2:07:02] <ThatGuyThere03> @TheAntiNihilist I think they're gonna be adapting a lot of plot elements from the original and doing new stuff with them at the very least
[2:07:03] <KingKrampus> squall and Zidane > Cloud
[2:07:03] <+OwlLightningMage> They do technically have an out now. They could technically not finish doing everything people want
[2:07:06] <%beefomkers> They already remastered 8
[2:07:08] <Shardlab> Increase the speed and agility rather than slow it down
[2:07:11] <%beefomkers> Looks alright
[2:07:11] <Tomschiii> still want my Monster Hunter underwater Combat back
[2:07:13] <mortificent> what kills my 16 hype is the setting, I kinda hate medieval settings
[2:07:17] <dinnydanny777> Anyway, enough about FF7R Bayonetta's cool
[2:07:19] <%Valdorick> FF8R already exists, its called Triple Triad in FF14
[2:07:19] <%beefomkers> Still not fun to play
[2:07:21] <afroking1124> @KingKrampus actually true
[2:07:22] <%tux_3do> ill deadass start a petition for ff6 remake
[2:07:22] <Dave_VD> No way could they make a game that satisfyingly incorporate the weapons and travelling across the world in an airship. They've lost their touch
[2:07:24] <cloakofashes> I want a FF8R because it'll annoy one of my friends and thus lead to hilarity from me.
[2:07:25] <KingKrampus> @beefomkers no it was a remaster not a remake
[2:07:33] <Shardlab> You are liquid and cut through the water like a shark, not a lunkhead diver
[2:07:37] <cloakofashes> For me, even.
[2:07:39] <%beefomkers> Yeah I said that
[2:07:41] <Flame_Water> do a barrel roll
[2:07:46] <+thecosmicfly> I remember liking the underwater combat for Syphon Filter Logans Shadow on PSP. Dunno if thats crazy or not
[2:07:53] <%DashXero> What is Pat doing up this early/late?
[2:07:55] <MsVcol> damn son, poggers
[2:07:56] <Shardlab> There: Underwater combat as a fish, not a diver
[2:07:56] <Commander_Deko> There's a chance we see Botw 2 before Bayo 3 and thats crazy
[2:07:56] <%depressed_skeleton> bopbopbopbop
[2:07:57] <%wibbwobbler> really like ff7r interpretation of turn based combat. pretty brilliant without going full dmc, which i feel would have been a mistake
[2:07:59] <%mikessdd> MH tri was one of those things where. When it was the most current MH I could play. I let it slide. But once like MH4 came out I was practically nutting to underwater being gone.
[2:08:01] <%ConLin_Arts_> Also as I have said, OG FF7 is still out there, on every single platform, you don't have to play one over the other
[2:08:02] <jimmytwofeet> You alright there Pat
[2:08:04] <KinduVborrd> No probimbo
[2:08:04] <KingKrampus> I had a crush on Rinoa and Garnet as a kid, I want to see them remaded
[2:08:08] <KinduVborrd> Prohimbo
[2:08:11] <TheAntiNihilist> @thatguythere03 like, obviously they will still have the same important locations, but what happens in them is anyone's guess. that Snake impalement scene sure won't be impactful at all anymore
[2:08:13] <MsVcol> I don't know how to play action games like this without just button mashing
[2:08:15] <+OwlLightningMage> I would be so pissed if they Remake 6 like seven LUL
[2:08:18] <%Ipsenscastle> just got here, I assume Pat's sleep is fucked up?
[2:08:18] <KinduVborrd> Prohimbition
[2:08:20] <%tux_3do> @wibbwobbler i will give props to ff7r for the combat
[2:08:23] <%cowardman93> ... that sentence is about what I expected with a stream at this time
[2:08:23] <%depressed_skeleton> i think pats having a stroke
[2:08:24] <+ekodrop> where is paige
[2:08:26] <%beefomkers> Garnet is a qt
[2:08:28] <%ConLin_Arts_> Is Gief sleeping?
[2:08:33] <%luckypineapple> I miss the old combat system but I like this new combat system too. I just prefer the OG style cause i prefer turn base
[2:08:35] <KinduVborrd> Yeah Pat, how did you sleep?
[2:08:41] <powerprotoman> pats gone full snes starfox babble
[2:08:45] <+thecosmicfly> This isn't lucid dreaming, this is lucid streaming
[2:08:47] <Mangahero18> @mortificent The las few FF games have all been scifi with magic settings so Im hyped for something different. Gimme Game of Thrones with Chocobos!
[2:08:49] <%Mekhet09> Rinoa was probably the worst FF waifu next to Sarah from 13-2. She was so fucking out of place with the story.
[2:08:50] <%Srthunda> I think the underwater levels in subnautica were fine
[2:08:56] <DianaTheAscian> oh its bigger and more cube now
[2:08:58] <Kronark> Did anyone have a problem with square marketing FF7R as a remake when it's really FF7-2?
[2:09:02] <KingKrampus> @beefomkers Garnet/Dagger is my Supreme Ff waifu
[2:09:03] <%tux_3do> @OwlLightningMage :( i think it would be cool! the reason why i think people dont play ff6 as much is because the 16 bit visuals and audio leave a worse taste in modern gamers' mouths
[2:09:04] <%ConLin_Arts_> I like more active RPGs like Like a Dragon and the first two Paper Mario
[2:09:08] <+OwlLightningMage> Keifka is in his final boss form all the time hiding around corners and wanting to fuck Terra to make a summon baby LUL
[2:09:09] <$Mr_Bop> @msvcol button mashing is a fine place to start tbh. We all had to start there
[2:09:10] <KinduVborrd> You ran away so well
[2:09:15] <+thecosmicfly> @Srthunda Which ones?
[2:09:18] <KinduVborrd> The biggest, best coward
[2:09:21] <koffeemancer> It was before you jumoed into the second portal @PatStaresAt
[2:09:23] <$NoctisxMog> ff7r combat is so addictive @tux_3do
[2:09:24] <%ConLin_Arts_> it is a RE-MAKE
[2:09:30] <%ConLin_Arts_> they are remaking it all
[2:09:36] <+ekodrop> is that weapon between the legs?
[2:09:41] <%mikessdd> You can (not) remake
[2:09:42] <%luckypineapple> FF16 has not made much of an impression on me so far, I hope it gets a more dystinct look soon
[2:09:43] <%ConLin_Arts_> it is also pretty much the story
[2:09:44] <%beefomkers> Rinoa is a bitch to you at first and suddenly wants to bounce on squall's dick for no reason
[2:09:47] <%ConLin_Arts_> remaking what happened
[2:09:48] <+joec182> oh no i got more content of the thing i love this is awful
[2:09:50] <KingKrampus> oh hey shenpai is streaming ff14
[2:09:50] <KinduVborrd> This enemy is cool
[2:09:56] <krin_x> are bayo's weapons on loan from rodan or does she sell them like dante inbetween games
[2:09:58] <SaltkeyAndAckfish> @PatStaresAt i'm sure you've had this question before, but are you ever going to use the betting system on twitch?
[2:10:04] <%beefomkers> Her character is so boring
[2:10:05] <mortificent> @mangahero18 I guess that's the thing, the oversaturation of the medieval setting I media after the success of GoT made me really burnt out
[2:10:16] <%tux_3do> i hope ffxvi has a tweaked version of ff7 remake combat, from what I've seen its just devil may cry combat with a fantasy skin and thats concerning
[2:10:17] <Commander_Deko> by the skin of your ass
[2:10:20] <KingKrampus> @beefomkers which character is boring
[2:10:20] <SaltyAzteca> STONE.
[2:10:22] <Kronark> All the ghost shit makes no sense if you haven't player the original. It's basically a sequel.
[2:10:24] <%ConLin_Arts_> Do you people want Advent Children???
[2:10:28] <Kronark> played*
[2:10:30] <Mangahero18> Since it changes Plot elements FF7 Remake is actually a reboot.
[2:10:32] <+ekodrop> rrestart
[2:10:33] <+OwlLightningMage> @tux_3do I'm saying that I would want a remake and not a sequel that told you it was a remake
[2:10:34] <KinduVborrd> That ice kick thing Bayonetta does looks extremely painful
[2:10:42] <Mangahero18> DeS is a Remake.
[2:10:42] <SaltyAzteca> yeyeyeyeye
[2:10:42] <%ConLin_Arts_> Shilly Shally Dilly Dally
[2:10:44] <%DashXero> Well, at least you're having fun.
[2:10:46] <KingKrampus> @conlin_arts_ advent children was 👍
[2:10:48] <%Bonkasaurusrex> Bonkasaurusrex subscribed with Prime. They've subscribed for 13 months! 
[2:10:49] <+OwlLightningMage> It's totally actually a reboot
[2:10:58] <+OwlLightningMage> It's a sequel reboot
[2:11:01] <%SaiyanShoto> FF7R is more a sequel than reboot
[2:11:06] <%tux_3do> @OwlLightningMage ok fair
[2:11:08] <mortificent> FF7 Remake is a sequel
[2:11:08] <KingKrampus> I remember when advent children first came out
[2:11:08] <%beefomkers> I don't want Advent Children
[2:11:11] <+joec182> its a seaboot
[2:11:11] <Mangahero18> basically yea.

[2:11:16] <KingKrampus> the hype was real
[2:11:20] <KinduVborrd> Big kick

[2:11:51] <%cowardman93> gib now
[2:11:55] <TheAntiNihilist> @luckypineapple well everyone said they hated FF13. I feel like 16 went for an anti-FF13 style
[2:11:57] <KingKrampus> actually i also want a spirits within watch party
[2:11:57] <%tux_3do> i would genuinely like to ask advent children fans in the chat, why do you like advent children, i dont wanna be mean but i want to see your point of view
[2:11:58] <+OwlLightningMage> Nomura is bad of making bad
[2:11:59] <KinduVborrd> God loves vinyl
[2:11:59] <%Monkeyweed21> are you crab?
[2:12:03] <jimmytwofeet> FF7R is going to need at least four, probably five games
[2:12:07] <dinnydanny777> Kefka was great in Dissidia
[2:12:07] <+OwlLightningMage> Nomura is bad
[2:12:11] <SaltyAzteca> Rich Evans truly is a paragon of future sight
[2:12:13] <%beefomkers> My mom got Advent Children because she knew I liked to play 7 and we had to watch it while we ate dinner one time when I was a kid
[2:12:13] <%DashXero> Take your time.
[2:12:14] <DianaTheAscian> k
[2:12:19] <Spudnacious_Dynasty> Don't apologize.

[2:12:24] <@SoFarFetched> It's okay,I'm still working on a shitpost for you and Paige right now.
[2:12:27] <+sugoisniper> @OwlLightningMage Hopefully you're kidding
[2:12:27] <%Kirby_Sauce> just do it on normal and speed through it
[2:12:30] <KingKrampus> @tux_3do it was a landmark in cgi animated movies of its time
[2:12:33] <%Dakuu75> mission again? meh, i'm fine with it.
[2:12:35] <dinnydanny777> @beefomkers That must have been embarrassing, I'm sorry NotLikeThis
[2:12:35] <+joec182> endless FF7 trash
[2:12:37] <TheAntiNihilist> yaaay
[2:12:38] <%beefomkers> I think it actually gave me ptsd
[2:12:39] <+OwlLightningMage> NOMURA IS BAD
[2:12:39] <mortificent> ok chat, Tifa, Ultimecia and Terra are best FF waifus
[2:12:42] <SaltkeyAndAckfish> @tux_3do it was the continuation of FF7 we so desperately needed Kappa
[2:12:43] <jimmytwofeet> @cowardman93 Really? 3 games?
[2:12:46] <+BrendenLive> brende1Tea1 brende1Tea2 steescBurg
[2:12:48] <+OwlLightningMage> BIG TRUTH
[2:12:56] <SaltkeyAndAckfish> KappaHD
[2:12:58] <%beefomkers> @dinnydanny777 It keeps me up at night sometimes
[2:13:01] <%Dakuu75> speedrun
[2:13:02] <+ekodrop> speed run?
[2:13:02] <MsVcol> ZOOMIES
[2:13:03] <Kronark> I'm glad FF7 AC exists. It's easy test to see if I want to engage with someone. I can just ask them if they like it.
[2:13:06] <SaltyAzteca> SPEED RUN TACTICS
[2:13:06] <%augusta_wind> oh boy
[2:13:07] <%Valdorick> PatSpeedsAt

[2:13:12] <@SoFarFetched> and putting mustard stains
[2:13:15] <KinduVborrd> R2+Select pat
[2:13:17] <KinduVborrd> Pat
[2:13:21] <+sugoisniper> @OwlLightningMage I hope your toast isn't as stale as that take
[2:13:25] <%beefomkers> Who actually likes Advent Children
[2:13:29] <KinduVborrd> Paige has the squirm worm?
[2:13:29] <%cowardman93> @jimmytwofeet yeah I'm intrigued how they're gonna squeeze the rest in. I assume a lot of the fluff of some biits is gonna get skipped
[2:13:32] <%Ipsenscastle> Solid Pat vs Liquid Paige
[2:13:33] <KingKrampus> @mortificent Tifa, Rinoa, Garnet and Yuna/Lulu you mean
[2:13:37] <+OwlLightningMage> Pat stop lying. You have the giant tasty cakes
[2:13:48] <%beefomkers> I estimate there are exactly three humans alive who like Advent Children
[2:13:48] <DianaTheAscian> oh god 5.41 is done
[2:13:48] <+OwlLightningMage> It is your ass ruining things
[2:13:49] <%tux_3do> @SaltkeyAndAckfish @KingKrampus ok so followup question, now that there are more advanced cgi movies today and proper followups to ff7 like what the remake is doing, do you still like advent children as much as on your first watch?
[2:13:51] <SaltyAzteca> pat noooo BibleThump
[2:14:02] <MsVcol> like that
[2:14:02] <%wibbwobbler> i can actually see ff7r being wrapped up with one more game. probably not tho with ever crisis and shiz
[2:14:02] <Commander_Deko> I think its a bat
[2:14:03] <mortificent> @kingkrampus Rinoa ain't hotter than Ultimecia
[2:14:06] <Akett> I liked Advent Children when it came out when I was a teenager. The spectacle on the fights was amazing.
[2:14:08] <+HyTricksy> suck a nut NA eu time stream baby
[2:14:08] <%Kitafin> drill
[2:14:19] <@SoFarFetched> jokes on you Im in NA Kappa
[2:14:22] <%beefomkers> The fights kicked ass
[2:14:27] <Kronark> No tons of people love Advent Children.
[2:14:27] <KingKrampus> @tux_3do i haven't watched it in years, but I think I can appreciate it for what it was at the time?
[2:14:29] <KinduVborrd> I am also NA'
[2:14:38] <%cowardman93> @SoFarFetched go to sleep
[2:14:39] <%beefomkers> everything else was japanese writing cringe
[2:14:47] <+OwlLightningMage> I'm excited for Remake 2 to just a playable version of Advent Children LUL
[2:14:49] <@SoFarFetched> It's too early for me to sleep geefChair
[2:14:50] <%mikessdd> NA here
[2:14:53] <%tux_3do> @KingKrampus ok i cant agree with you but i respect that
[2:14:57] <@SoFarFetched> I got like 3 more hours til sleep
[2:14:59] <dinnydanny777> I still want a new 1v1 Dissidia game NotLikeThis
[2:15:00] <KingKrampus> @mortificent i will admit, Ultimecia is prime monster wife
[2:15:02] <KinduVborrd> Loki wants you to slow down and go faster, that selfish fucking shitlord
[2:15:04] <+joec182> @beefomkers but thats what you want
[2:15:07] <%cowardman93> it's like 7 AM fetched
[2:15:11] <@SoFarFetched> at a reasonable 6am geefVen
[2:15:13] <%ItsCaptainDisco> What time is it for Pat even?
[2:15:23] <KinduVborrd> 7 AM for Pat
[2:15:27] <@SoFarFetched> yeah 7am for pat
[2:15:27] <Kronark> 7:16 am for Pat.
[2:15:30] <%mikessdd> It would be 7 for pat
[2:15:41] <@SoFarFetched> its 4am for me psaDab
[2:15:41] <DianaTheAscian> oh god its 4
[2:15:43] <%DashXero> Was that an attack from off-screen?!
[2:15:44] <KingKrampus> @tux_3do hey man, I get it's not for everyone, I mean, I love Spirits Within, and lots of ff fans hate it
[2:15:48] <KinduVborrd> I hate you Loki
[2:15:48] <%ItsCaptainDisco> His Bayo thirst today is strong huh
[2:15:51] <$NoctisxMog> me too BibleThump @dinnydanny777
[2:15:52] <+sugoisniper> O R B
[2:15:53] <mortificent> I want Square to make Spirits Within but an actual good game
[2:15:56] <%BallerSwagBro9k> LUL LUL LUL LUL
[2:16:05] <dinnydanny777> All of Loki's linereads are bad what are you talking about LUL
[2:16:10] <Arek_1> I recently read the English dubbed script for Advent Children. And fuck... no person talks like that... Hope the original subs were better.
[2:16:21] <%thatfeel> Wtf was Spirits Within even about?
[2:16:22] <%beefomkers> No I want good writing not Kojima Nomura bullshit
[2:16:23] <+thecosmicfly> Oh damn its 12 midday. Time to go to bed
[2:16:24] <%mikessdd> Uh oh. Kitty knows I’m awake and wants the food.
[2:16:27] <%cowardman93> @mortificent you mean NOT spirits within? But still get Buschemi
[2:16:29] <KinduVborrd> I never really used the scythe
[2:16:32] <%beefomkers> Here's the real hard truth
[2:16:35] <+thespacecop1> yeah I'm glad I watched AC subbed
[2:16:38] <KingKrampus> first time I ever watched Spirits Within was with my mom, and it helped cement my desire to make animated movies one day
[2:16:42] <%wibbwobbler> spirits within at least had an interesting setting lol
[2:16:44] <KinduVborrd> I liked Love Is Blue a lot
[2:16:45] <%beefomkers> most japanese writing is really bad
[2:16:45] <Kronark> Hot take. I like Spirits Within. I don't think it's amazing or perfect. But I certainly don't hate it.
[2:17:05] <+HyTricksy> hair stand truly is the most powerful
[2:17:07] <@SoFarFetched> remember when people got hyped when a final fantasy movie was first announced
[2:17:07] <%beefomkers> Spirits within confused me
[2:17:08] <dinnydanny777> It still irks me how in Advent Children they solve the Mako problem, with coal! Which is so much better for the planet Kappa
[2:17:10] <%ConLin_Arts_> My favorite weapon in this game was the hammer, it just melted enemies
[2:17:11] <%beefomkers> I thought
[2:17:11] <huskarl_zap> morning chat = Joaquin Phenox dancing down the stairs
[2:17:13] <KingKrampus> @kronark i like you, thats a good take
[2:17:14] <mortificent> @cowardman93 DUDE Imagine if Buschemi was your red mage in the party, super cool
[2:17:15] <%Kirby_Sauce> really pat?
[2:17:16] <@SoFarFetched> No you're Canadian Pat,not Russian
[2:17:20] <%beefomkers> What fucking game is this based on?
[2:17:22] <%Kirby_Sauce> i thought you were canadian
[2:17:23] <+OwlLightningMage> Gotta rush fast
[2:17:27] <%augusta_wind> i thought you were canadian not russian
[2:17:28] <%Valdorick> @SoFarFetched Most people don't remember, because they're not old.
[2:17:31] <%beefomkers> Is this like a psp game?
[2:17:32] <%SegaDSi> rushing right to death
[2:17:35] <%augusta_wind> dang it chat
[2:17:35] <%beefomkers> Turns out no
[2:17:42] <@SoFarFetched> @beefomkers WiiU,Switch Game
[2:17:43] <%beefomkers> They just called it Final Fantasy
[2:17:44] <$NoctisxMog> all I remember of ac is sephiroth clones and tifa fight scene
[2:17:45] <%cowardman93> @SoFarFetched I was one of them. Then I was hyped for the second FF movie
[2:17:46] <%ConLin_Arts_> I like the Cube one from 1 more
[2:17:50] <KingKrampus> @beefomkers spirits within was an original story
[2:17:53] <%Tenebrae94> since you're rushing you might as well use items @patstaresat
[2:17:58] <%DashXero> Pat Rushin'? Is he sending Forget-Me-Nots?
[2:18:02] <Arek_1> @dinnydanny777 Not coal. Barret calls Cloud to saw the he discovered oil.
[2:18:18] <%beefomkers> @kingkrampus Yeah, I know that now. Back then I was scratching my head over it.
[2:18:19] <KinduVborrd> I didn't watch Spirits Within because I was five
[2:18:22] <+OwlLightningMage> I don't like this enemy
[2:18:23] <Arek_1> Say*.
[2:18:27] <KingKrampus> @arek_1 that implies dinosaurs in Midgar's past
[2:18:27] <dinnydanny777> @arek_1 Ah I forgot which it was then, basically the same problem though LUL
[2:18:29] <%DakotaMacDoodle> What the hell you live right now for
[2:18:32] <%beefomkers> I thought I missed a spin-off or something
[2:18:36] <%Ipsenscastle> @dinnydanny777 to be fair theyre not really solving the problem, just scraping to survive until their inevitable extinction
[2:18:37] <%ConLin_Arts_> we all know 9 is the best FF, it has Vivi!
[2:18:41] <DianaTheAscian> @PatStaresAt hey Pat did u ever finish gundam Zeta?
[2:18:45] <+ekodrop> how are you enjoying bayonetta 3?
[2:18:45] <huskarl_zap> Spirits within > Dirge of Cereberus > Seven > =========== remake
[2:18:46] <@SoFarFetched> no this is the official sequel to the first bayonetta
[2:18:51] <%Valdorick> Vivi = Best = FF9
[2:18:51] <%cowardman93> Do you not remember Disc Room?
[2:18:52] <%ConLin_Arts_> Quality commentary
[2:18:52] <%SaiyanShoto> Did you forget Disc Room?
[2:18:55] <%augusta_wind> glad i'm here to see it live
[2:18:59] <jorniev> ITS NOT THE WORST
[2:19:00] <cloakofashes> Aren't there dinosaurs in Midgar's present?
[2:19:04] <KinduVborrd> I dunno Pat, that would be a lot to dig through to make sure
[2:19:04] <theanora1> the problombo was good, A+
[2:19:08] <@SoFarFetched> Disc Room remains in our hearts
[2:19:09] <KingKrampus> @beefomkers i just accepted it because, after how different 8 9 and 10 were, I just accepted anything could be ff
[2:19:15] <%tux_3do> yeah ffix is not my favorite final fantasy, but i love it for its back-to-basics vibe
[2:19:16] <HibikiYamada> it's only natural to get carried by Bayo, it's okay
[2:19:19] <%cowardman93> it was hilarious
[2:19:21] <+OwlLightningMage> I notice that no one is talking about that FFXV movie LUL
[2:19:25] <%augusta_wind> "oh no, DISC ROOM"
[2:19:27] <dinnydanny777> @ipsenscastle True, but you'd think they'd be trying to find something better than oil or coal
[2:19:28] <bleugh> DIsc room
[2:19:30] <%SaiyanShoto> Then there’s also that dragons crown stream LUL LUL
[2:19:31] <KinduVborrd> My favourite was the Muffins Are Cakes War
[2:19:32] <%DakotaMacDoodle> D I S C R O O M
[2:19:32] <DianaTheAscian> Disc room
[2:19:34] <%ConLin_Arts_> Big Brain Pat
[2:19:36] <KingKrampus> @conlin_arts_ vivi is my son
[2:19:36] <@SoFarFetched> "haha this streamer's brain is fried and can only say "disc room" over and over" - Social Media people
[2:19:37] <%beefomkers> Oh yeah that
[2:19:41] <%beefomkers> didn't see it
[2:19:45] <$NoctisxMog> vivi best
[2:19:46] <huskarl_zap> The rumble fish?
[2:19:48] <%mikessdd> Kingsglaive? Yeah what’s there to talk about?
[2:19:51] <+OwlLightningMage> No one did
[2:20:02] <+OwlLightningMage> LUL
[2:20:06] <KingKrampus> Kuja > Sephiroth
[2:20:09] <KinduVborrd> Face-Off?
[2:20:10] <%ConLin_Arts_> Pat could have stroke on stream and people would just laugh
[2:20:17] <bleugh> I mean Pat did make it pretty memorable. Disc Room.
[2:20:20] <huskarl_zap> lul
[2:20:20] <Rawbone_saw> early am bayo stream??? HELL TO THE YES
[2:20:24] <mortificent> People hate Nomura, but they still forget about Toriyama
[2:20:30] <agrocraig01> are you up early, or been up? lol
[2:20:34] <%augusta_wind> does he want you to hurry up or slow down
[2:20:34] <dinnydanny777> Kuja's cool, he walks around in a thong
[2:20:35] <KingKrampus> are we sure PAT Hasn't had a stroke on stream yet 🤔
[2:20:38] <@SoFarFetched> he woke up early
[2:20:43] <Rawbone_saw> been up
[2:20:47] <+OwlLightningMage> Toriyama is actually the worst ever
[2:20:50] <KinduVborrd> If this were on PC, they could mod Loki out
[2:20:56] <+nazzynoeyes> Its 12;21 here in UK and the ginger boi is streaming? :D
[2:21:00] <SaltyAzteca> HHYYY- skip
[2:21:04] <%ConLin_Arts_> LUL
[2:21:08] <+OwlLightningMage> The ending of 13 3 is the worse thing in Final Fantasy
[2:21:09] <%beefomkers> gross
[2:21:09] <+ekodrop> as he jumps off the stage
[2:21:17] <Arek_1> NOMURA was the NORMAL ONE! He actually stopped some of the more outlandish ideas that Kitase and Nojima had.
[2:21:18] <Kronark> @mortificent I am capable of a great deal of hate. There's enough to go around.
[2:21:20] <%ItsCaptainDisco> Is Pat skipping cutscenes for any particular reason, or just because?
[2:21:21] <KingKrampus> @dinnydanny777 my brother voice acted 9 for me and my sisters, and gave Kuja a Keith David voice
[2:21:21] <SCIENCE_25> I'm too intelligent for this shit.
[2:21:23] <%Ipsenscastle> if Toriyama was responsible for the end of XIII-3 then yes he's the worst thing ever
[2:21:25] <moonmintparadise> psaJpeg do you keep repeating the same level or have you been trying to reach that gate of hell for an hour now ?
[2:21:25] <%tux_3do> ayy come on guyss, toriyama just wanted to write his lightning ff fanfiction
[2:21:26] <+OwlLightningMage> It will never be topped
[2:21:26] <agrocraig01> was he supposed to fall off the edge there?
[2:21:29] <swirlyeye> holy shiii early stream?
[2:21:35] <%ConLin_Arts_> he missed some parts of the LP
[2:21:40] <%ConLin_Arts_> so he is getting them
[2:21:41] <jorniev> DESTINY IS DESTINY
[2:21:42] <mortificent> I will never forgive Toriyama for the 13th Birthday
[2:21:50] <+sugoisniper> Bayonetta can reverse time with her THIGHS, mad respect
[2:21:50] <%Monkeyweed21> remember Toriyama having a boquet of roses when he talked on stage about Lightning
[2:21:53] <KinduVborrd> @ItsCaptainDisco Pat is replaying the mission to get some weapon parts he missed
[2:21:56] <cloakofashes> I know Super wasn't the greatest, but to call it Lightning fanfiction...
[2:21:59] <+Swiglou> lol I forgot about Destiny is Destiny
[2:22:02] <richard_madden95> @owllightningmage Was that the Lightning Return one?
[2:22:04] <dinnydanny777> @kingkrampus LUL
[2:22:05] <+michingmallecho> I guess in the end, the real lightning returns were the friends we killed along the way
[2:22:09] <+OwlLightningMage> The ending literally lightning comes to th real world to fuck him
[2:22:09] <DianaTheAscian> god I'm glad pat is streaming or I would have had to keep watching Gundam zz
[2:22:10] <+BIumen> when i think back to the original XIII trailers....12 may have wanted to be star wars but 13 wanted to be the prequels specifically
[2:22:14] <%Kirby_Sauce> hah, he thinks he's helping\
[2:22:15] <+OwlLightningMage> 3
[2:22:17] <Mangahero18> Toriyama? Dragon Ball Toriyama?
[2:22:17] <huskarl_zap> god wants it to end
[2:22:18] <+OwlLightningMage> yes
[2:22:22] <%ConLin_Arts_> I still have only played 13 and 13-2 of the 13 games, I liked both of them
[2:22:23] <%ItsCaptainDisco> @kinduvborrd Ahh, cool, gotcha
[2:22:28] <%DashXero> Verse 7
[2:22:28] <KingKrampus> like I know it's my own childhood experience, but Kuja with a Keith David's Goliath from Gargoyles voice is epic no matter what
[2:22:29] <jorniev> TURNS OUT THAT DESTINY IS IN FACT DESTINY
[2:22:30] <+OwlLightningMage> The FF Toriyama
[2:22:30] <dinnydanny777> Wasn't Toriyama responsible for Third Birthday?
[2:22:32] <+Ml33tninja> !help
[2:22:34] <%ConLin_Arts_> post a picture on Twitter Pat
[2:22:39] <%wibbwobbler> lightning returns man oof
[2:22:40] <huskarl_zap> Never forget Lightning made earth
[2:22:41] <%ConLin_Arts_> I want to see the baby
[2:22:46] <redial_nick> is 13 still super big for no reason?
[2:22:47] <%Ipsenscastle> the two FF things that make me angriest are the end of XIII-3 and Chadley
[2:22:51] <KinduVborrd> God forgot his records
[2:22:52] <+OwlLightningMage> HE is also Third Birthday man
[2:22:52] <+Ml33tninja> !time
[2:22:55] <redial_nick> on PC
[2:22:56] <+Swiglou> Oh god Third Birthday hurt my soul
[2:23:02] <mortificent> yeah Toriyama made the 13 games and Third Birthday
[2:23:07] <+michingmallecho> Protec the Chadley daphStab
[2:23:09] <%ConLin_Arts_> Minh's Big Con
[2:23:10] <%tux_3do> @dinnydanny777 OH GOD HE WAS
[2:23:15] <Mangahero18> Toriyama should stick to designing boss art for Dragonquest.
[2:23:18] <KingKrampus> I think Woolie's meltdown over 3rd birthday was epic
[2:23:19] <Arek_1> @Mangahero18 Motomu Toriyama, not Akira Toriyama.
[2:23:22] <dinnydanny777> XIII-2 and Lightning Returns were actually pretty alright games to play but the stories suck
[2:23:24] <%IRashonal> IRashonal subscribed at Tier 1. They've subscribed for 31 months, currently on a 26 month streak! I've been subbed to your for 2 1/2 years, shit's wild dude
[2:23:27] <KinduVborrd> Rest In Peace Parasite Eve
[2:23:29] <Mangahero18> ohhh
[2:23:31] <richard_madden95> @ipsenscastle Lol Chadley LUL

[2:23:39] <+Over_ninek> no can hear
[2:23:40] <%beefomkers> Toriyama doesn't do anything really
[2:23:45] <+amiroodude> which FF game is best?
[2:23:47] <%beefomkers> It's mostly what's his fuxk

[2:24:14] <nzrai> that's cheating
[2:24:14] <%Bonkasaurusrex> 9
[2:24:15] <Arek_1> 7.
[2:24:15] <+OwlLightningMage> 6, 9, 4, tactics
[2:24:15] <dariusclover> V
[2:24:15] <jorniev> TACTICS
[2:24:16] <Kronark> 7 for me.
[2:24:17] <KinduVborrd> Kingdom Hearts II
[2:24:17] <KingKrampus> fuck off with tactics 9 is better
[2:24:18] <%Ipsenscastle> but 9 obviously
[2:24:18] <%mikessdd> 9
[2:24:20] <Mangahero18> ITS 9 YOU FUCK
[2:24:20] <+nazzynoeyes> CRISIS CORE :3
[2:24:20] <mortificent> @amiroodude to me it's 6 or 7, depends on the day
[2:24:22] <huskarl_zap> third birthday
[2:24:24] <Akett> 9
[2:24:25] <%Valdorick> I liked Tactics better when it was Tactics Ogre though.
[2:24:25] <+OwlLightningMage> 5 maybe
[2:24:26] <citerel> tactics is great
[2:24:26] <%Daniel_Is_I> FF3 isn't the best but it's not awful, PAT
[2:24:27] <%Mekhet09> Yeah, tactics.
[2:24:27] <+ekodrop> dragon quest 3
[2:24:32] <BluBox> Tactics is strong as hell
[2:24:32] <+michingmallecho> It still makes me laugh that Square put so much money and research into the luminous engine and what, one game used it? LUL LUL
[2:24:35] <%augusta_wind> i've never played a FF game and at this point i'm too afraid
[2:24:38] <+sugoisniper> @PatStaresAt I think bayo exists in some weird relation to the world in DmC, also these games are both Kamiya's love children
[2:24:38] <%DashXero> Pat's super right.
[2:24:38] <dinnydanny777> I probably like 7 the most
[2:24:40] <%beefomkers> Tactics (Advance)
[2:24:44] <+Ml33tninja> Tactics this isn’t even question
[2:24:45] <DianaTheAscian> @PatStaresAt which numbered ff game?
[2:24:47] <%cowardman93> I'm really surprised the Nobody from DMC never came over to BAyo
[2:24:48] <+OwlLightningMage> Pat is not wrong
[2:24:48] <richard_madden95> @tux_3do Do you mind telling me what make him among the worst?
[2:24:48] <$NoctisxMog> pat is right
[2:24:48] <KingKrampus> pat you're wrong 9 is the best
[2:24:50] <+amiroodude> damn need to play tactics now
[2:24:50] <Kronark> I'd take Into the Breach or Advance Wars over FFT
[2:24:54] <%Monkeyweed21> just gonna diss FE like that
[2:25:00] <KinduVborrd> Pat, will you ever stream Shining Force?
[2:25:02] <%StormBuster24> I mean IX is my favorite
[2:25:03] <%Retinolgaming> Final Fantasy: Three Houses
[2:25:07] <%beefomkers> Fuck I wish I still had my Tactics Advance cartridge
[2:25:14] <+OwlLightningMage> Advance Wars, more like Bored Whores
[2:25:14] <%ConLin_Arts_> I don't remember many of the demons in this game
[2:25:15] <+Over_ninek> man that demon sure looks like they ripped it right out of SMT
[2:25:18] <%ConLin_Arts_> maybe only SLoth
[2:25:20] <%wibbwobbler> tactics
[2:25:24] <mortificent> naahh Front Mission 3 is better than Tactics
[2:25:28] <%Valdorick> Best numbered FF? FF9, fite me
[2:25:29] <%Ipsenscastle> if only someone would release a good version of Tactics
[2:25:32] <%luckypineapple> it still astonishes me how terrible 15 is
[2:25:38] <SaltyAzteca> how do one shot shoot 8 boolet
[2:25:39] <+michingmallecho> I still play Tactics...on my PSvita daphPray
[2:25:42] <%YakumoYomi> I'll take Dragon Force over any other strategy/tactics game
[2:25:42] <KingKrampus> Bayonetta as a guest character in smt nocturne
[2:25:49] <+OwlLightningMage> 15 is still better than 13
[2:25:51] <%ConLin_Arts_> as I said, 9 has Vivi, the best boy
[2:25:55] <%Mekhet09> @PatStaresAt Is front mission 3 not better then tactics?
[2:25:57] <+Swiglou> FF8 is unintentionally the funniest game ever tho
[2:25:59] <KinduVborrd> Dragon Force, the band?
[2:26:02] <%Bigbossman91> 15 is way better then the trash that is 13
[2:26:02] <%mikessdd> If anyone wants to play tactics use a psp emulation
[2:26:02] <Ner234> @SaltyAzteca It's mulitple shots
[2:26:05] <%beefomkers> The best Final Fantasy game is Shin Megami Tensei Nocturne
[2:26:08] <KingKrampus> 12 is better than 15 but 15 is better than 13
[2:26:12] <%luckypineapple> 13 is better on account that it is a game that is finished
[2:26:14] <+OwlLightningMage> Pat right
[2:26:16] <dinnydanny777> XV is so middling
[2:26:22] <afroking1124> i kinda liked 15 when iris was in the party cause i didnt have to be the healer
[2:26:23] <Kronark> @luckypineapple 15 amuses me. The core story is decent but it's told in the worst way possible. Paced horribly, stop the game and go watch this movie here, etc.
[2:26:24] <%luckypineapple> that is the only thing that puts it over the edge
[2:26:26] <%ConLin_Arts_> BUT I have to say, 14 is my favorite FF
[2:26:28] <afroking1124> lasted like an hour tho
[2:26:33] <+OwlLightningMage> 13 is still really bad though
[2:26:35] <LopperUK> ff15 is one of my fav games tbh
[2:26:35] <Mangahero18> ITS FINE PAT. WE ALL KNOW DRAGON QUEST 8 IS BETTER THAN ANY FF GAME.
[2:26:37] <$Mothman742> Pat is my favorite vtuber :)
[2:26:39] <+OwlLightningMage> like
[2:26:42] <$NoctisxMog> 8 i messy but I don't think it's bad
[2:26:43] <%DashXero> Front Mission 3 ... Kreygasm
[2:26:50] <%tux_3do> @richard_madden95 he was the director of the 3rd birthday which means he basically killed parasite eve, and was a major force behind the ff7 compilation which did major character assassination to the characters of ff7 (aka emo cloud), and was the man to take the wheel of ffxv and derail nomura's vision of versus xiii. he also was behind the ffxv shared universe that led to such abominations as kingsglaive
[2:26:51] <+michingmallecho> Nocturne featuring Dante from the Devil May cry series was great
[2:26:55] <SaltyAzteca> @patstaresat When is the FM3 stream tho
[2:26:56] <%cowardman93> Front mission 3 isn't as good as the best Front mission game, Left Alive
[2:26:56] <%Valdorick> 15 is a good game with good systems, but a shit story.
[2:27:00] <%luckypineapple> The worst part about 15 is just how amazing Versus 13 looked
[2:27:00] <+Ml33tninja> #facts
[2:27:04] <+OwlLightningMage> 15 is undercooked, 13 is a bad whole meal
[2:27:05] <%ConLin_Arts_> this is a baby game for babies
[2:27:07] <KingKrampus> @mothman742 pat as a vtuber would be a Banjo Kazooie toilet
[2:27:12] <huskarl_zap> @mothman742 Make him into a Tau toilet avatar
[2:27:17] <+sugoisniper> @PatStaresAt Not all of them are hidden, they're all a pain to complete tho
[2:27:24] <+sid_jcol> pat, any tips for a first time dark souls player?
[2:27:26] <%beefomkers> So, how about Chrono Trigger?
[2:27:31] <%Valdorick> 15 COULD have been better, 13 shoulda been scrapped and never spoken of again.
[2:27:35] <$Mothman742> @huskarl_zap @KingKrampus yall twins?
[2:27:39] <KinduVborrd> I bought Front Mission 3 for PS3 like five years ago but then I tried Devil May Cry and have been playing that for the last five years instead
[2:27:46] <+OwlLightningMage> Chrono Trigger is better than most FF games
[2:27:52] <%beefomkers> @sid_jcol If you cut the bridge dragon's tail a sword comes out
[2:27:58] <DianaTheAscian> @PatStaresAt which of the 4 monhun generations flagships was your favorite?
[2:28:06] <huskarl_zap> or a necron toilet so then he would be the most useless toilet in the universe
[2:28:12] <dinnydanny777> XV's story isn't even that bad it's just that it never tells you what it's story even is about
[2:28:13] <KingKrampus> @mothman742 nah, it's just easy to describe Pat as a Vtuber Toilet transformer
[2:28:14] <%Valdorick> Wait, if sequels taint past games for Pat, does that mean Chrono Trigger sucks because Chrono Cross exists?
[2:28:15] <%DashXero> Gammoth
[2:28:20] <+Over_ninek> YEAH Glavenus
[2:28:22] <Commander_Deko> Mizutsune
[2:28:23] <dinnydanny777> XV's storytelling is awful
[2:28:30] <+sid_jcol> @beefomkers bet, thank you
[2:28:31] <+sugoisniper> Valstrax is fucking dope too, as well as Gore and Shagaru Magala
[2:28:34] <%tux_3do> ffxiii is probably the worse game but i cant deny ffxv pisses me off more
[2:28:37] <ChloeFleurage> Mizutsune for asthetics, Astalos for the fight
[2:28:37] <$Mothman742> @KingKrampus tbf its the ONLY way to describe him
[2:28:38] <%DashXero> Why would you hate Malfestio?!
[2:28:39] <moosemonkey397> i like lagiacrus, but thats cuz i actually played tri
[2:28:42] <DianaTheAscian> stupid owl
[2:28:44] <afroking1124> zack > cloud dont @ me
[2:28:44] <+Gespens> Nargacuga is my favorite, followed by Lagi and Glaive Anus
[2:28:44] <Mangahero18> @Valdorick Yes
[2:28:46] <SCIENCE_25> 4U's flagships were all good imo.
[2:28:47] <KingKrampus> I liked Chrono Cross personally
[2:28:50] <%DashXero> Malfestio is the most interesting fight in the game...
[2:28:51] <+alphonseisbest> man Pat's up quite late WTF
[2:28:53] <%IRashonal> Hafta give it to Glav, sword blade sharpened with your own teeth is pretty raw
[2:28:57] <cloakofashes> "Try to keep up! ...hey, wait!"
[2:28:58] <%beefomkers> Chrono Cross sucks because it isn't in Toriyamas artstyle
[2:29:05] <Arek_1> Why don't people understand why Cloud in Advent Children is the way he is? PTSD, survivor's guilt, dying from essentially cancer, seeing his (pretty much) adopted son dying from the same cancer. C'mon.
[2:29:09] <+alphonseisbest> @afroking1124 TRUTH
[2:29:10] <%mikessdd> Wait lagiacrus is in generations? Crap I need to play more of that.
[2:29:11] <%Mekhet09> Freedom Unit with tigrex was my favorite but I keep losing interest in Monhun as it changes. I think I'm hitting a point where I'm like fuck constant sequels I just want the old thing.
[2:29:12] <%beefomkers> Fuck I like the way that guy draws
[2:29:13] <%DashXero> Well, most interesting non-world threatening fight in the game.
[2:29:15] <+OwlLightningMage> Chrono Trigger is a classic
[2:29:16] <Commander_Deko> Bayo 3's comin out this year, right guys shibuy4Kazuma
[2:29:17] <KinduVborrd> For a first Dark Souls playthrough, I would recommend that you stay calm, be as cautious as you can, and pay close attention and don't be afraid to get help
[2:29:20] <%ConLin_Arts_> man, there is so much I remember from Bayo 1, but not from this
[2:29:23] <+Swiglou> Cross sucks cuz it has a bunch of interchangeable outside of their stupid accents characters lol
[2:29:25] <KingKrampus> @beefomkers fair but also, it's art style isn't BAD necessarily
[2:29:25] <Tomschiii> lagi without underwater is so lame
[2:29:49] <+sterlingnano> Pat, you can't complain about your sleep schedule being fucked next week when you're streaming so early.
[2:29:55] <DianaTheAscian> Ivory Lagi though
[2:29:58] <Commander_Deko> dammit pat that's a bat
[2:29:58] <%Mekhet09> Cross is great if you look at it as it's own game.
[2:29:59] <SaltyAzteca> CAUGHT HIM FLINCHING
[2:30:06] <Tomschiii> @mekhet09 dont get that logic
[2:30:08] <%beefomkers> Oh I know it's not bad. It's just generic 3D jrpg shit. It's not ugly, just not interesting.
[2:30:12] <+sugoisniper> I hope we get a bunch of Insect Monsters in Rise, I need to serenade a spider to death with the new Hunting Horn
[2:30:12] <Mangahero18> For Bloodborne its the exact opposite. Being Overly catious just gets you killed. That game requires you to be super agressive.
[2:30:18] <%averyoddjew> i just noticed this guy has a tiny face
[2:30:20] <KingKrampus> @mekhet09 exactly, especially if you never played Trigger
[2:30:25] <%beefomkers> Looks plain
[2:30:41] <kulmoth> what does perform do with the new hunting horn?
[2:30:45] <manlydawgs> patrick its so early
[2:30:48] <%Mekhet09> Eh. I played it before I played trigger. Trigger is a great game but like Cross works on it's own.
[2:30:55] <Ner234> I played Cross before even knowing Trigger existed. Playing Trigger after didn't make me hate Cross.
[2:30:58] <%cowardman93> bayo one looks so bland
[2:31:06] <KinduVborrd> Bayo 2 big pretty
[2:31:10] <mortificent> ok, SMT Nocturne is the best in the series
[2:31:20] <+sugoisniper> bayo 1 piss: Ew
[2:31:21] <+Over_ninek> oh man is this a boss arena
[2:31:22] <%beefomkers> Yeah
[2:31:24] <KingKrampus> I never could get into Bayonetta for the longest time
[2:31:24] <%mikessdd> I put most of my time into chrono trigger on the bad psone port before grabbing the ds version. Always thought it was a good game.
[2:31:28] <%beefomkers> You're right it is
[2:31:28] <huskarl_zap> Youre surrounded by piss right now
[2:31:28] <DianaTheAscian> thats brown trend was the worst
[2:31:30] <+sugoisniper> Bayo 2 piss: WOw this is some really good piss
[2:31:33] <%beefomkers> However
[2:31:34] <+fockniapo> cturne shit
[2:31:37] <TakesGuts> what time is it in pat land?
[2:31:39] <afroking1124> staring dante from the Dmc series
[2:31:39] <%beefomkers> Fuck those skeletons
[2:31:40] <Mangahero18> Stop fooling around says useless shit kid
[2:31:40] <+fockniapo> wait till SMT V
[2:31:46] <@SoFarFetched> 7:30am in Pat land
[2:31:49] <saltduhwound> saltduhwound subscribed at Tier 1. 
[2:31:52] <KingKrampus> because long hair Bayonetta looked too much like one of my sisters at one point and it felt weird
[2:31:55] <%Mekhet09> I liked nocturne but I don't know if it's better than what came before it. I do know I hated 4 and 4A fuck those games. I hope SMT V isn't that shitty.
[2:31:57] <+fockniapo> nocturne is very good but it is not the old testament or anything
[2:32:00] <%cowardman93> FROGGO!
[2:32:10] <Kronark> Will Bayo 2 ever make it's way to a non-nintendo platform or did nintendo fund it to the point that it's locked to them?
[2:32:17] <%beefomkers> and that stupid fucking maze puzzle with the star guy
[2:32:20] <%beefomkers> God
[2:32:21] <%tux_3do> i think when you play bayonetta, you kind of have to turn your brain off, its a more casual game compared to devil may cry. like a greasy fast food while dmc is the prestige gourmet
[2:32:27] <+BIumen> dog if true
[2:32:30] <%mikessdd> Bayo 1and2 are on pc I think.
[2:32:31] <%beefomkers> Actually Nevermind Nocturne pisses me off
[2:32:34] <%SaiyanShoto> We pay for this commentary
[2:32:35] <+fockniapo> dog
[2:32:35] <%cowardman93> this is the commentary the europeans deserve
[2:32:35] <%saltduhwound> My god it’s early where I’m at hahaha
[2:32:37] <@SoFarFetched> this is pretty much my bedtime stream geefPlz
[2:32:44] <%SaiyanShoto> And for this gameplay
[2:32:45] <Kronark> Bayo 1 is on PC. I don't think 2 is.
[2:32:45] <afroking1124> dont worry pat chats just arguing about video games, you good
[2:32:46] <KingKrampus> which is weird, because the only time said sister looked like Bayonetta was when she dyed her hair black for a theater role
[2:32:46] <huskarl_zap> haha doggo froggo haha thank you money
[2:32:49] <%beefomkers> No nevermind it's good
[2:32:53] <mortificent> I feel Nocturne nails the feel, aesthetics and gameplay the best out of the mainline series
[2:32:54] <@SoFarFetched> yeah 2 is locked to consoles right now
[2:32:55] <Vermilingus> @Kronark if I recall Nintendo published it so pretty low chance
[2:32:59] <WonderSign> Bayo 1 is on pc not 2
[2:32:59] <%mikessdd> Ah okay my mistake
[2:33:01] <DianaTheAscian> @PatStaresAt u mentioned Lagi was your fav but which one?
[2:33:03] <%ConLin_Arts_> SourPls
[2:33:04] <+fockniapo> no no Nocturne is a masterpiece, the puzzle is super comfy, just like that fucking sector in strange journey
[2:33:12] <%tux_3do> yeah tbh pat doesnt need to give good commentary because we're busy bickering in the chat
[2:33:13] <cloakofashes> Heck a ton of cherries.
[2:33:17] <zephlink> 2 is nintendo exclusive

[2:33:24] <Arek_1> Hecatoncheres?
[2:33:25] <%beefomkers> That puzzle is tedious and boring
[2:33:25] <+fockniapo> basketball
[2:33:26] <%Mekhet09> @fockniapo It's not but SMT 4 made a number of changes which were pretty bad. Forcing party members that trigger the fucking smirk system was the worst.
[2:33:28] <+RyTYoung> woooo
[2:33:30] <+Gespens> so proud of them

[2:33:50] <%beefomkers> k bye
[2:33:50] <%tux_3do> i just need smt5 to be a cross between the design and aesthetic of smt3 with the polish of persona 5
[2:33:51] <Kronark> That voice is awful.... I hate it.
[2:33:56] <dinnydanny777> Oh good he's gone PogChamp

[2:34:19] <huskarl_zap> Pats not okay he remembered the point and hasnt been the same
[2:34:19] <+fockniapo> @Mekhet09 I think that the smirk needed much more work in SMT IV, but I enjoy the story very very much, unlike 4 apocalypse
[2:34:22] <%tux_3do> STAY WITH DEMON SLAYER KAREN
[2:34:22] <Commander_Deko> shibuy4Kakyoin

About the ffxv development thing, wasn't like Tabata basically trying to save ffxv because the moment he was position to handle ffxv, he already have to work with an exhausted team. Because Nomura taking so much time to finish ffxv being changed from versus xiii, square just changed director during the mess & left Tabata with what left of ffxv. tNot sure if it was Tabata fault tho. More like Square management hell problem.

[2:50:03] <afroking1124> this dude: i started a war for no reason. kid kills his waifu, you are evil that must be vanquished
[2:50:04] <richard_madden95> @tux_3do The versus xiii cinematic idea was all Nomura idea. Not tabata. Tabata was only being position to help ffxv development from being abandon. You know how ambitious Nomura can be & when he was given a position to be a director for versus xiii, he went all out. But the problem was that he only had a team of 17 when working for versus xiii. Since square want a new ip for final fantasy, thats when the development hell started. Tabata at least save what Nomura want the character to be as.
[2:50:07] <%BallerSwagBro9k> His VA is so bad LUL

[3:04:51] <richard_madden95> @tux_3do Yup. People shit on Tabata when all he was doing was trying to salvage what Nomura has left for him to work with. If anyone to be bkame for ffxv, its Square management team. The fact that he keep updating ffxv & fixing bugs in straight 3 years after its being released, he does care about ffxv a lot. Even though ffxv story has been derailed from what it's originally, the character still truth to Nomura vision. Ffxv actually only start development 5 years before the release.
[3:04:52] <+RJay80> LUL

[3:07:27] <%tux_3do> @majindusto i have a theory that the reason why the ending of the kingdom hearts 3 dlc is identical to the versus xiii trailer is because hes going to try and adapt the versus xiii into the next kh trilogy

[3:17:10] <%Valdorick> Crazy Talk
[3:17:29] <Brickston> and it's the blood elevator from DMC5
[3:17:32] <HeavyC4> damn this is the tree done dmc5
[3:17:39] <dukenux> wait no, not Uriziel. a different one that you have to craft for an orc vision quest or sth
[3:17:45] <majindusto> Wait, How did she shoot a Heart Bullet pattern?
[3:17:56] <zephlink> magic
[3:17:57] <richard_madden95> Was there ever a game that have a really fuck up version if Hell? The one that really fuck you up. Haven't experience one yet. Any suggestions?
[3:17:57] <Brickston> witch magic
[3:17:58] <%Valdorick> Magic

[3:18:02] <+corrosivePaladin> magic
[3:18:03] <%Valdorick> Big Sex Energy Magic
[3:18:04] <ItsJustShawn> witch
[3:18:10] <gustavozxd> does this game have any nonsense secret mission location like in 1? LUL
[3:18:13] <%GummiBunnies> hint: don't get hit
[3:18:19] <KingKrampus> @richard_madden95 there's dante's inferno
[3:18:19] <HeavyC4> I expect a dante and vergil boss fight in bayo 3
[3:18:21] <majindusto> lol
[3:18:21] <ItsJustShawn> if you say no to god, you too can shoot in a heart pattern
[3:18:21] <Taku_> one of my greatest accomplishments was getting every achievement in bayo 1
[3:18:46] <gustavozxd> that's insane
[3:18:49] <Taku_> I did cheese the latter half of non-stop infinite climax mode
[3:18:56] <SaltyAzteca> that's insane. those achievements are insane
[3:19:04] <Taku_> you can do infiinite flutes
[3:19:10] <KingKrampus> @richard_madden95 then one of the last Shitstorm games was this one with a hell with vagina head monsters
[3:19:10] <%Monkeyweed21> Rodin is locked to nonstop climax too
[3:19:18] <Taku_> the roomwide aoe thing
[3:19:22] <Picia000123> non stop infinite climax seems like hell to be honest
[3:19:29] <+Over_ninek> the way the environment moves is fuckign rad
[3:19:32] <%Valdorick> Majora's Mask?
[3:19:36] <+angel_crossrosds> okay, what is actually the deal with Gracious and Glorious? why does everyone talk about that?

[3:19:41] <Shardlab> Oh no
[3:19:45] <cinless> oh it's yoshimitsu
[3:19:46] <%Valdorick> He's moving kinda fast for being 'sloth'
[3:19:51] <zephlink> he moves pretty fast to be the personification of Sloth
[3:19:53] <%averyoddjew> i love sloth's design
[3:19:54] <huskarl_zap> Sloth is awfully fast
[3:19:54] <dukenux> he seems fast for Sloth
[3:19:55] <KingKrampus> @valdorick Majora's wrath
[3:20:01] <%tux_3do> @richard_madden95 depends on what kinda fucked up you going for. agony is weird vagina symbolism hell, scorn is hr giger hell, silent hill is psychological barbed wire hell

[3:21:10] <KingKrampus> @richard_madden95 agony I think?
[3:21:15] <Brickston> weeooo
[3:21:18] <%tux_3do> agony sucks as a game but its creepy looking

[3:23:32] <That_Mojo> face to foot style, how'dy like it
[3:23:40] <%BillyMaze> its always suprising how much optional shit there is in bayo
[3:23:43] <%Kirby_Sauce> it also might bring up the omikron lp
[3:23:57] <richard_madden95> @tux_3do Maybe like something so humiliating that you feel as you were them? Something so fuck up that you didn't want to admit you've felt before & the game maybe sort of present that as hell to make you feel shameful. That idea sounds interesting for me.
[3:24:27] <Taku_> I believe in you
[3:24:28] <%Valdorick> Daymn gottus

[3:25:10] <DianaTheAscian> oh ted talks
[3:25:11] <%averyoddjew> i still have no idea why they are called Ted Talks

[3:32:33] <%KineticZen> He's Thanatos but better
[3:32:36] <%Valdorick> Fun fact - Female Hyenas have penises. Make with that info and his analogy as you will.
[3:32:41] <amonimis> what if you just stand there
[3:32:44] <AnneSQF> is Rodin the Blade of demons? Like a demon-hunting demon?
[3:32:46] <%BillyMaze> I want a playable rodin
[3:32:54] <KingKrampus> why does he have the name of that pterodactyl kaiju from godzilla
[3:32:56] <+TheotherKristian> The fight against him is equally fucked

[3:33:10] <dinnydanny777> Did Rodin just say get the fuck out of here LUL
[3:33:11] <ShineTheDiamond> @Valdorick They give birth through those penises
[3:33:18] <%Movemeister> I see @valdorick knows their inter species reviewers lore
[3:33:21] <+thecmash> is tag climax not in the switch version? rodin is totally playable
[3:33:32] <%Ipsenscastle> @KingKrampus Rodin was a famous sculptor
[3:33:32] <KingKrampus> @valdorick not so much penises as really elongated clitorises re hyenas
[3:33:35] <%averyoddjew> also possibly because they are resistant to demon weapons? just a thought i hve
[3:33:51] <%Valdorick> I knew that lore before Interspecies reviewers was a twinkle in its horny creator's eye.
[3:33:54] <KingKrampus> @ipsenscastle was he? had no idea
[3:34:03] <huskarl_zap> I never saw the last two episodes of Interspecies review
[3:34:06] <SaltyAzteca> WAN PANCH
[3:34:08] <%Valdorick> @KingKrampus Also yes, correct.
[3:34:15] <%tux_3do> hyenas are so fucking weird, and so fucking cool
[3:34:33] <dukenux> " Mm ;) "
[3:34:48] <KingKrampus> @tux_3do people have been trying to domesticate hyenas
[3:34:50] <ShineTheDiamond> Pupper!
[3:34:51] <richard_madden95> I wonder if they gonna make Rodin as the main villain in Bayo 3 or maybe a conflicted character. Also I wonder if they ever gonna touch the Queen Sheeba & others godlike being. The way Rodin presented made him seems godlike.
