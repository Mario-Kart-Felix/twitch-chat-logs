[0:16:06] <CasualSleepyGamer> Silent Hill Snow
[0:16:08] <+ThomasOfTroy> In my city, the plow just goes around the car and buries it in snow because fuck you
[0:16:19] <+Gorotheninja> Montreal sounds like the Detroit of Canada.
[0:16:30] <%Alazull> @PatStaresAt At least they warn you, in my little town they just tow your car with no warning of any kind. Especially since they don't always plow, and sometimes will tow from streets they don't plow.
[0:16:30] <%tizz86> Paige should know better
[0:16:30] <%XeroSigmaPrime> @tizz86 XD some areas do
[0:16:31] <penitentpendant> "They have to..." "No they don't."
[0:16:31] <%Bailey__gaming> Mr Plough, that's my name, that Name again is MR.plow

[0:16:44] <alyss988> noooo
[0:16:44] <+TinyLittleDancer> In the US my city will just declare a "snow day" and those days you can't park on the curb
[0:16:46] <ninnokabin> My city just has salt trucks,

[0:16:54] <%FlamingoJazz> thas weird.
[0:16:56] <$Dew217> Jesus. Boston is like that
[0:17:00] <1matheuw> but then again butt parasites are awfully common here in banana land
[0:17:04] <%KineKithZen> Why no driveway if house
[0:17:06] <+GuilKato> @Gorotheninja Monteal become Human (if you want to)
[0:17:08] <%Bt_Robot> As a resident of the Torrid Zone, this is very confusing for me.
[0:17:08] <%Bailey__gaming> @peachsaliva is car become Cube?
[0:17:11] <%XeroSigmaPrime> Some areas in the US have those signs... But tons of em dont... fucking Wisconsin
[0:17:12] <leinadtonu> Paige running from a good plow?
[0:17:13] <+Over_ninek> classic Paige
[0:17:14] <@PeachSaliva> I don’t know what those sirens mean! Could be anything!
[0:17:14] <%arancet> do you not have a driveway? or garage? or car hold?
[0:17:14] <Blank9> that is nondescript warning
[0:17:16] <%jnoble919> Frantic mustard pajama lady looking for parking
[0:17:17] <%FlamingoJazz> Yeah no driveway?
[0:17:17] <%VoidBaronJules> is car okay?
[0:17:20] <penitentpendant> It was either moving the car or Silent Hill invading. A real tossup.
[0:17:20] <%cervidaequus> Set gief on the plowman
[0:17:24] <%CapnClassix> Wait what happened?
[0:17:26] <@PeachSaliva> The car is totally fibe
[0:17:27] <%CapnClassix> Blizzard warning?
[0:17:28] <%BoxNavy> :)
[0:17:29] <+Over_ninek> Paige: Canada weird and foreign!!!
[0:17:32] <%iamnolionheart> I'm not shocked, from my experience down here they definitely do that a ploy for m o n e y
[0:17:33] <BTR_NOODLE> usually the siren means Silent Hill
[0:17:34] <$Dew217> Now We Know!
[0:17:34] <%weissguard> Is it safe to assume that you don't have a driveway to use in this time?
[0:17:34] <1matheuw> lesson for life
[0:17:35] <+Gorotheninja> Thats what you get for worshipping a maple leaf!
[0:17:35] <%king_wragles> Is it some kind of tornado or disaster or are they plowing the streets? WHO KNOWS! Welcome to Montreal!
[0:17:35] <%FlamingoJazz> Car death.
[0:17:37] <+ThomasOfTroy> Is it a dedicated sound for those sirens?
[0:17:39] <%BoxNavy> i hate montreal
[0:17:43] <penitentpendant> Pyramid Head driving the truck
[0:17:44] <+TinyLittleDancer> Yeah, missed the notice one day and had my car buried in snow the next morning

[0:17:47] <dan_g_v> a fibe car
[0:17:47] <@PeachSaliva> I hate Montreal so much
[0:17:51] <ExpressNode> Too bad your car won't come back to the nexus
[0:17:51] <%Fooguwu> Maybe every else knew because it had snowed and therefore they must plow
[0:17:51] <bakkatohri> Don't buy new cars, adopt
[0:17:54] <1matheuw> so i guess montreal hates car
[0:17:55] <bakkatohri> Also don't trust car PETA

[0:18:23] <%Alazull> What a charmer
[0:18:24] <+DrFacilier> So is Montreal the LA of Canada?
[0:18:30] <%BoxNavy> and live in
[0:18:31] <%tizz86> that's new york
[0:18:31] <+GuilKato> but the most important question is how did this car tale effect Zangief!? did the sirens disturb the Baby?
[0:18:36] <1matheuw> now thats makes sense
[0:18:39] <+skeletonmilk> I went to Montreal once and I fucking LOVED it. I live in Minneapolis so it's like a cooler version of it.
[0:18:44] <+mkenney24> most cities are a nightmare to own a car
[0:18:49] <%FlamingoJazz> That's most big cities.
[0:18:54] <%PigGuy800> fair enough
[0:18:55] <Blank9> just choose not to be discriminated against
[0:18:56] <%KineKithZen> I drove up to Montreal in the Before Times. I should have just flown

[0:19:33] <+reallybigrocks> Probably the only city that's not a nightmare to own a car in is Detroit because it was Car-opolis but even then idk

[0:45:38] <%bardocckk> the compulsion relieves the obsession

[0:45:40] <+AngriestAngryArtist> LOL that's what I do as well :P
[0:45:41] <%BoxNavy> he HAS to do it
[0:45:44] <TurtlesAndTentacles> Huh..........I do that.....
[0:45:44] <+Pyroclase> Sometimes I get out of bed in the middle of the night to adjust things on my desk on the next floor up.
[0:45:45] <%Buzzard42> the ritual isn't the disorder, it's the meltdown for failing to follow the ritual
[0:45:45] <Blank9> One day at work, I took an early lunch break and drove half an hour home to double check I had locked my door.
[0:45:49] <+Over_ninek> love the anxiety bomb
[0:45:51] <+Dova573> thats me whenever I clock in/out of work
[0:45:57] <%tizz86> I'll just stick with my clinical major depression,
[0:46:03] <%goatbait> What if you're just forgetful about if you locked the door or not?
[0:46:13] <+BoltWarden> being able to describe a type of behavior with the disorder that represents the extreme 'disorder' version of that behavior is incredibly helpful for humans being able to understand each other
[0:46:13] <%BoxNavy> monkaS
[0:46:16] <+Dova573> I be like did I clock in or not and gotta check again
[0:46:18] <%Lilgamba> That sounds rough
[0:46:21] <@commanderclaw> Oof
[0:46:21] <DaBigVitus> it's an airbnb who cares?
[0:46:23] <CloniiCory> This only happened to me once...but it turned out I actually didn't lock the door. So.
[0:46:25] <%augusta_wind> my dad has the OCD and he and i have had some Moments like that
[0:46:28] <Dave_VD> @Badgerconda_ Only if the 'freak out' is genuinely so bad that you can no longer function normally
[0:46:30] <1matheuw> that seems fun
[0:46:31] <+Katamori777> Yo Pat, trim your hair! You look like a sex weirdo
[0:46:33] <%skyentombment> @PatStaresAt I'm currently dating a girl with ocd, one of her big issues is with her hair. She has to set apart like 3 hrs of the day just in case the ocd spikes and she ends up doing her hair for that long
[0:46:33] <%TinyLittleDancer> That example is more OCD.
[0:46:33] <%AncelDeLambert> aint autodrive brain fun?
[0:46:36] <leinadtonu> It's kinda curious to hear peeps experiences when at worst I've just felt sad.
[0:46:36] <%ClericOfSparda> That's rough
[0:46:38] <+AmanDotZip> @DaBigVitus kinda the point
[0:46:51] <fuji_92> @dabigvitus that's not how OCD works, his OCD cares

[0:52:48] <%Lilgamba> My nan had that. She used to hear voices and it resulted in her basically lashing out at my mom and uncle. She did eventually get treatment for it
[0:52:48] <heart_ablaze> makes me wanna sock them in the face
[0:52:49] <%saadi90> It’s the worst
[0:52:50] <@commanderclaw> "Gee son, why do you play so many videogames if this is what social interaction means?"
[0:52:54] <%DiscoMatador> Thats a Soul Killer
[0:52:54] <%skyentombment> "Having that beer will be like masturbating for an hour straight and not even get close to cumming"
[0:52:55] <BerryliciousDefinition> RIGHT??????
[0:52:56] <xeros720> all i can think is, "i wonder why that person hates his family, there's probably a lot of good reasons"
[0:52:56] <Sotetsu> You know what bothers me? Airline food! What's the deal with airline food?
[0:52:56] <%BoxNavy> jermaPluto

[0:52:58] <%augusta_wind> @toolofparanoia YEAH
[0:52:58] <@SSaryn> Is that the worst in terms of a Holiday ever? It probably is.

[0:53:07] <%BoxNavy> im not dumb not even a one dumb
[0:53:08] <%weissguard> psaWrong
[0:53:10] <RandyFistburgers> Extreme lack of motivation and cyclical self deprecation are no bueno
[0:53:13] <%vexion_smh> pat galaxy brain
[0:53:15] <DaBigVitus> in grade school a bunch of kids started clapping when i told them i showered the night before. that stung
[0:53:16] <thesugardaddy111> "oh look who decided to show up" ok fine ill go back then
[0:53:16] <1matheuw> not by that much of a large margin pat
[0:53:17] <marvel877> Say pterodactyl, Pat.
[0:53:20] <ToneBacas> yeah that shit sucks. why don't people just act like it's business as usual and don't point it out

[0:53:24] <KeiPrime> no youre pat
[0:53:26] <%Movemeister> He’s Pat

[0:53:35] <xeros720> ptsd is pretty rough, and i only know due to family members
[0:53:35] <@commanderclaw> It's hyper nuanced, it's hard to understand
[0:53:40] <%McSoliace> that shit also sucks
[0:53:43] <BerryliciousDefinition> PTSD fucking sucks
[0:53:45] <KeiPrime> what about dsp
[0:53:45] <Badgerconda_> complex PTSD is fucking hell, and nobody takes it seriously.

[0:53:57] <+TheotherKristian> @marvel877 puh-terrordactyil
[0:54:00] <battlexqueen> It’s hard because people think if you’re not a veteran you don’t have it
[0:54:00] <%MrGuy516> General Familiar of the Canadian Army.
[0:54:05] <%Monkeyweed21> highlights include rape and abuse victims being told they dont have PTSD cuz they weren't in the war @PatStaresAt
[0:54:07] <%Dakuu75> getting complicated
[0:54:08] <%tizz86> raises hand
[0:54:11] <thesugardaddy111> I am clinically depressed and it sucks
[0:54:11] <%TinyLittleDancer> If you have your PTSD, please ask your doctor about a care plan and if you are a candidate for group therapy which can work wonders
[0:54:17] <SulfurousAcid> I got diagnosed with dysthymia
[0:54:20] <@commanderclaw> It's the difference between your brain breaking on it's own, and something *else* breaking your brain
[0:54:20] <1matheuw> my brain dont work good
[0:54:22] <%AncelDeLambert> difference between depressive state and clinical depression
[0:54:23] <%baka_sugoi> Brain no work please come later
[0:54:23] <%BoxNavy> Bee
[0:54:28] <karovus> brain juice machine broke

[0:54:50] <thesugardaddy111> see thats kinda what I have
[0:54:52] <%Lilgamba> How do you discern depression from just melancholy?
[0:54:54] <%RetroCop87> The prospect of losing your job is infinitely worse feeling than having to deal with having lost your job
[0:54:56] <1matheuw> understandable off to die then
[0:54:56] <%BigCoffee> What about that moment when the sadness finally goes away, and you feel ok for the first time in years, and then it goes back to being bad. So you feel extra worst.
[0:54:56] <%tizz86> because it sells for more
[0:54:58] <RandyFistburgers> its like tha dmv for the brain, fill out juice b in order to get juice f
[0:54:59] <%WhereIsWill> hook em up with LIKECIN
[0:54:59] <%Archer2150> We can make it so your body doesnt STOP producing brain juice B
[0:55:00] <%toolofparanoia> The environmental shit is just the fuel on the neurological fire.

[0:55:14] <penitentpendant> "Oh no! Brain Juice F turned you American!?"
[0:55:19] <%goatbait> Isn't depression more consistent than melancholy?
[0:55:20] <%Agami23> man. i had a person who took me out to do stuff because of my disabilities. but the dude actively mocked me when i tried to do anything fitness related and catcalled girls while on the job. i think i got him fired when reporting it.
[0:55:20] <+reallybigrocks> We can give you this thing that makes your brain not suck up all the brain juice so you don't feel like TOTAL shit but you won't feel good
[0:55:20] <heart_ablaze> too real goddammit
[0:55:26] <%BinaryFireball> Oh did brain juice X make you run down the street crying? try brain juice Y
[0:55:27] <%captainpodock> Why did Sarah Tonin leave me?

[0:55:32] <thesugardaddy111> wrong war
[0:55:32] <%skyentombment> I imagine it's "I lost my job and the guy who fired me did it in a humiliating way, and now I'm terrified of even interviewing"
[0:55:32] <leinadtonu> MAN UP!
[0:55:33] <%BallerSwagBro9k> HOT AND COLD WATER THERAPY
[0:55:34] <%MidnightBurst12> a bullet to the head on occasion
[0:55:37] <ExpressNode> Wasn't it world war 1?
[0:55:37] <a_mad_dragon_> no it started out as "cowardice" before they acknowledged it as a disease
[0:55:39] <%Archer2150> that way of dealing with shell shock STILL EXISTS
[0:55:40] <@commanderclaw> My ancestor got PTSD from Gettysburg and his wife divorced him over it
[0:55:40] <%MrGuy516> here's some whiskey you pansy.
[0:55:41] <%Maids4lyfe> There's a type of PTSD that instead of being based on fear response it makes you feel intense shame and sense of failure instead which I heard about recently and is more related to childhood trauma
[0:55:42] <%baka_sugoi> Shell Shock
[0:55:43] <%augusta_wind> The War Brain Sickness
[0:55:46] <RandyFistburgers> Full metal jacket good movie on that
[0:55:51] <%Razputin217> Yup that’s a Carlin bit
[0:55:52] <%Archer2150> saying oh suck it up and shoot some taliban its the worst
[0:55:53] <%BoxNavy> never go to war
[0:55:57] <+Pyroclase> Remember when Patton got suspended in the middle of WW2 because he attacked some traumatized soldier at a field hospital for "trying to get out of fighting?"
[0:55:59] <%TinyLittleDancer> "War Fatigue" was the funny cute name it was given in Vietnam
[0:55:59] <KeiPrime> Battle Fatigue
[0:56:00] <BerryliciousDefinition> Wasn't it combat fatigue at some point or is that something else?
[0:56:01] <%BallerSwagBro9k> War is unnat
[0:56:01] <%toolofparanoia> I'd to kill me some Nazis... THANKFULLY I LIVE IN THE US :D
[0:56:02] <@SSaryn> If you see someone shot right in front of you, YOU PROBABLY MIGHT NOT LIKE THAT.
[0:56:02] <Fien111> I drove a psychiatrist nuts by being clearly mentally ill and then going through like 2 dozen medications and NOTHING worked. I think my weird brain started breaking their faith in their chosen field
[0:56:05] <DaBigVitus> manowar - shellshocked
[0:56:11] <%skyentombment> In the wise words of Tokyo Godfathers "You don't need to be an orphan to feel abandoned"
[0:56:12] <%baka_sugoi> war never changes
[0:56:15] <%BallerSwagBro9k> War is unnatural

[0:58:02] <+BisoromiBear> boobs are fake asses
[0:58:02] <%Archer2150> attraction to breasts isnt paraphelia thats absurd
[0:58:04] <Badgerconda_> Nah, boobs are fake butts is all.
[0:58:06] <%RetroCop87> PRISON SCHOOL, all chests are imitation asses
[0:58:06] <+Pyroclase> Isn't it only a paraphilia if it's like, an obsession with them?>
[0:58:06] <xxshadowxx416> it milk why we like breast
[0:58:07] <%Kduff89> booba
[0:58:07] <penitentpendant> TBF, we find comfort in them for the first couple years of our lives

[0:58:13] <ExpressNode> But breast are on people though and people aren't things
[0:58:16] <%caramelatte1> So you like females
[0:58:16] <thesugardaddy111> its just kind of a human thing we do
[0:58:20] <+Over_ninek> no breasts only A S S
[0:58:22] <%MoguManda> errybody got tits pat
[0:58:22] <+zeraux_> but titty just aesthically pretty sometime
[0:58:22] <leinadtonu> gigantic breasts, hell yeah!
[0:58:23] <BleedinActionMan> So is 'paraphilia' just the medical term for 'fetish?'
[0:58:24] <Fien111> If everyone is attracted to them.....it's not unusual?
[0:58:26] <qu3kl41n_the_impure_king> large breasts are considered more fertile, its lizard brain cave man stuff
[0:58:26] <Badgerconda_> that sounds a lot to me like super woke types wanting us all to feel bad for liking the tiddy, tbh
[0:58:30] <%baka_sugoi> Smol BOBS
[0:58:31] <rindoesstuffnthings> humans are just nasty
[0:58:32] <+ThomasOfTroy> Isn't it also associated with hunger?

[0:58:34] <spawnzie> A boob's a boob
[0:58:34] <ammobasket> Might be normal?
[0:58:35] <1matheuw> ass men unite!
[0:58:35] <Profmcstevie> Good boobs mean good health, good health means strong mom for bear child. Health is the basis for a lot of attractiveness
[0:58:35] <%goatbait> I thought it was because that's where the milk comes from and as kids we heavily rely on the tidd?
[0:58:35] <fuji_92> if it's common is it a paraphilia
[0:58:36] <%McSoliace> nice to know that chat is cultured
[0:58:37] <%snow_bush> Define big
[0:58:37] <%SirGO0SE> milkers are for everyone :)

[0:58:51] <%Archer2150> I have a paraphilia for using the technical terminology for everything
[0:58:53] <%BoxNavy> i like the booba
[0:58:58] <+BoltWarden> I think that comes from people trying to say breasts aren't inherently sexual 'because breastfeeding'
[0:58:59] <%lucasnazatoart> lucasnazatoart subscribed with Prime. 
[0:59:02] <leinadtonu> bubba
[0:59:02] <%Agami23> listen. people can like some fat mommy milkers. its not weird.
[0:59:02] <+reallybigrocks> The question is, does it exist in cultures where breasts aren't considered "private"
[0:59:03] <%augusta_wind> boob................
[0:59:05] <%snow_bush> At least it ain't feet.

[0:59:48] <Badgerconda_> don't describe them like that
[0:59:50] <%Futurecity10> BREASTS ARE FAKE ASSES
[0:59:50] <leinadtonu> boobs>butts
[0:59:51] <%Alazull> IIRC Paraphilia is like you're really attracted to something, fetish is when it's like you can't achieve arousal without it
[0:59:52] <hamishmacrae> Hey Pat, you’re swell, appreciate yah
[0:59:52] <thesugardaddy111> that means 2 things
[0:59:53] <extradopeness> Priorities

[1:00:01] <%goatbait> but poop tho
[1:00:03] <Zeif00> What about a dude with frontbutt?
[1:00:03] <%Lilgamba> Attraction is jut chemicals
[1:00:09] <%WhereIsWill> @BTR_NOODLE a person of culture I see lul
[1:00:09] <%Ipsenscastle> it's inherently ridiculous, birds have fancy feathers and dances because they're sexually selected for, same with humans and boobs
[1:00:11] <%BallerSwagBro9k> OOF
[1:00:14] <thesugardaddy111> diabetes?

[1:00:28] <%baka_sugoi> daiabetus

[1:01:03] <fuji_92> neutral and depressed
[1:01:03] <ergulor> Standar?
[1:01:04] <Badgerconda_> 2 is usually more depression with more low level mania (hypomania) i think?

[1:02:12] <%BoxNavy> IM FUCKIN INVINCIBLE moon2DEV
[1:02:12] <Dave_VD> Mania gives depressed people the energy to act on their depressive ideations
[1:02:12] <%Maids4lyfe> mania can also make you feel more motivated to kill yourself
[1:02:12] <LorcaNomad> that's fucking scary
[1:02:14] <1matheuw> LIKE THE GOOD OLD DAYS
[1:02:14] <leinadtonu> fuck, that sounds bad too.
[1:02:20] <%toolofparanoia> Become the juggernaut, bitch
[1:02:22] <%Ranryu692> there was a good arc in The Unstoppable Wasp comic that dealt with the dangers of mania
[1:02:23] <Sapphire_Breeze> reminder: you are not Sundowner

[1:02:37] <thesugardaddy111> take wm anyway
[1:02:39] <%Archer2150> My friend's girlfriend is bipolar and her medicine apparently forced her into a month long period
[1:02:42] <ExpressNode> I've seen that happen with my Brother's GF
[1:02:47] <%baka_sugoi> I don't need pills I'M GOD
[1:02:51] <%Kduff89> @PatStaresAt i was diagnosed at 9 so the routine of meds was hammered into me
[1:02:51] <%GalacticaPhanto> Kanye. ooof
[1:02:51] <leinadtonu> How do you know you're manic?
[1:02:53] <1matheuw> people need to stop rationalizing meds as the thing you take when you feel bad
[1:02:58] <penitentpendant> Speaking of Invinicble, had someone stand behind me in Wendy's w/o a mask on, smiling like a maniac. Cashier had to tell them to leave.
[1:03:00] <xxshadowxx416> but the Mario star
[1:03:00] <thesugardaddy111> like super boners?
[1:03:02] <$RealThiele> Cold turkey on meds can kill you with anti-depressants
[1:03:05] <%Kduff89> HELL YEAH THEY DO
[1:03:09] <%TalisKanju> I don't need 3D Sonic, I'm good with Mania
[1:03:11] <wembleyttv> And always take them at a certain time which SUCKS when you travel and your times change
[1:03:11] <leinadtonu> shit.
[1:03:12] <%BoxNavy> monkaS
[1:03:13] <%king_wragles> This is honestly way better than the shitty psychology classes I had access to
[1:03:14] <fuji_92> you'll know when u get out of manic
[1:03:15] <%Lilgamba> Is there an element of truth to Jung's theories of synchronicity?
[1:03:22] <mike2hands> sometime i forgot htat pat reads this kind of things
[1:03:22] <%wibbwobbler> alzheimer runs in my family, was dealing with stuff like that for a while
[1:03:23] <blastazoid00> Tricyclics are a bitch
[1:03:24] <%McSoliace> That's rough
[1:03:28] <mike2hands> is cool
[1:03:30] <Badgerconda_> @PatStaresAt what's hypomania (from bipolar 2) like? The descriptions I've seen seem really wishy washy and not very clear
[1:03:32] <%MidnightBurst12> life is rough
[1:03:34] <Fien111> disassociation's a lot of fun, too
[1:03:35] <%TinyLittleDancer> Schizophrenics suffer from the same issue where the severe paranoia they suffer from can make them not trust the very pils they need
[1:03:36] <%tizz86> i stopped seroquil for insomnia when I leard it was a schizophrenia drug
[1:03:39] <+TungstenViper> Mania = Macho Man Randy Savage
[1:03:44] <%toolofparanoia> @psydaku Normally I wouldn't but I hear he getting a divorce and his mental state probably ain't gonna be that great soon

[1:04:30] <leinadtonu> bad choice of words
[1:04:31] <Matt_Cowdery> "vitamins"

[1:04:35] <%BoxNavy> oh
[1:04:39] <SaltyAzteca> I'll have to check that ep again
[1:04:39] <%maskofmichael> This isn't even my full power

[1:04:44] <+TungstenViper> manic state: "the cream... the cream yeah!"
[1:04:44] <KeiPrime> super pooper
[1:04:46] <xeros720> one of the goblins may be bipolar
[1:04:48] <$RealThiele> omicron mass-induced mania
[1:04:53] <1matheuw> you meant acid ?
[1:04:53] <+ThomasOfTroy> I feel like bipolar is much more stigmatized than OCD
[1:04:54] <Badgerconda_> Bitches be complicated, pat
[1:04:56] <%Archer2150> The pat works in mysterious ways
[1:04:57] <%king_wragles> Cause you're saving the bipolar for marriage
[1:04:57] <Hydrapissed> more like tri polar
[1:04:58] <devanmuse> so mania was a side effect of the vitamin?
[1:05:00] <%BoxNavy> monkaS
[1:05:02] <+TungstenViper> YES
[1:05:04] <%AzureGale> Look up the BFP Deus Ex: Human Revolution LP
[1:05:04] <+WizoSavage> wasnt it narcissism?
[1:05:05] <%A_CD_By_Thomas> Yes

[1:05:40] <leinadtonu> Today's TED talk Pat's butthole.
[1:05:44] <%BoxNavy> i too love to get caught on one thought that popped into my head and then forget everything i did the pas3 days
[1:05:48] <RyanGelatin> RIGHT ANGLE
[1:05:48] <dan_g_v> oh Paige
[1:05:52] <%BallerSwagBro9k> Pat and Paige are opposites and opposites attract
[1:06:00] <%BTR_NOODLE> BTR_NOODLE subscribed with Prime. They've subscribed for 11 months! 
[1:06:02] <%jorniev> thats me too sometimes
[1:06:05] <%Monkeyweed21> Pat refuses to admit he has colorblindness
[1:06:08] <%tizz86> typical Tuesday
[1:06:13] <%goatbait> Was this a topic on a podcast episode once?
[1:06:14] <xeros720> whatcha doing? ~brain stuff~
[1:06:15] <wembleyttv> It's good to talk about stuff like this
[1:06:17] <%toolofparanoia> Mental Health chat YEAH!
[1:06:19] <+zeraux_> I FORGOT I HAD ICE CREAM NEXT TO ME AND IS TOO MELTY
[1:06:24] <wembleyttv> Hey I am going through that shit right now
[1:06:31] <Midnight188> i have crohns and ibd is like half a cro
[1:06:33] <+BoltWarden> I think I'm going to agree
[1:06:34] <+BoltWarden> yeah
[1:06:35] <ToneBacas> soft as in PC?
[1:06:36] <EldritchNeko> I agree
[1:06:36] <Badgerconda_> whatchu mean?
[1:06:36] <%Ne1son> Same fuck that shit
[1:06:36] <%Archer2150> Honestly, tell it like it is
[1:06:37] <%MidnightBurst12> yep
[1:06:38] <Profmcstevie> examples
[1:06:39] <Midnight188> do geel for you
[1:06:40] <SomersaultJustice> George Patlin over here
[1:06:40] <%Kduff89> Its cringe
[1:06:40] <SaltyAzteca> @zeraux_ Drink it. Do it.
[1:06:41] <thesugardaddy111> yeah cause its patronizing
[1:06:41] <austinj24> SAAAAAME
[1:06:44] <%Ipsenscastle> same
[1:06:46] <%eyezehuhh> same
[1:06:47] <wembleyttv> YEP
[1:06:48] <karovus> it can be big suffering
[1:06:49] <Hydrapissed> soft?
[1:06:51] <+eanscrale> Nah I get that
[1:06:51] <%caramelatte1> agree
[1:06:51] <+zeraux_> NOOOOO
[1:06:51] <%augusta_wind> felt that
[1:06:52] <xanerts> what you mean
[1:06:53] <+WizoSavage> It's touchy
[1:06:53] <%goatbait> Like sugar coating it?
[1:06:55] <LorcaNomad> George Carlin agrees on soft language
[1:06:56] <Badgerconda_> ohhh, yeah, the whole ... "don't be ablest" type shit surrounding it is dumb.
[1:06:57] <Midnight188> twitch plz let me see what im typing
[1:06:57] <%tizz86> PC? yeah, shit's getting outta control
[1:06:58] <devanmuse> @patstaresat yet you still refer to medication as "vitamins"
[1:07:04] <%MidnightBurst12> it's feels like it's dancing around the issue
[1:07:06] <+hottbutts> agreed. say wtf is up with you. no need to sugar coat it. youre the one living with it
[1:07:06] <marvel877> Its hell.
[1:07:09] <ManfredA> George Carlin had a fantastic bit about that regarding shell shock > PTSD
[1:07:09] <SaltyAzteca> @zeraux_ Do it. Drink the ice cream.
[1:07:13] <%arancet> lots of people seem to think your depression isnt serious if you dont have a gun to your head RIGHT NOW
[1:07:14] <%BoxNavy> yeah no one really does that for physical illnesses so wtf
[1:07:20] <+TheotherKristian> Shellshock had some flaws as a term but it conveyed the fact that it's bad very well
[1:07:22] <%ArchimerCXV> soft language comes off strictly clinical in the sense that you have been told outside from someone else you have it as if you were somehow unaware
[1:07:22] <leinadtonu> sensibilities change with the times I guess.
[1:07:22] <xeros720> yeah, it's why they switched from shell shock to ptsd, because one implies a god damn near death experience
[1:07:22] <%Ragnarok_Flames> YEYEYE im back
[1:07:23] <%Archer2150> wait you do hwat
[1:07:23] <1matheuw> so much sugar coating people be getting diabetes out here
[1:07:26] <thesugardaddy111> nah gotta take my vitamins which is just liquor
[1:07:26] <%snow_bush> But pat, you obviously must be treated like a baby and not like a grown man
[1:07:27] <%goatbait> Pill poppin' Pat
[1:07:30] <Badgerconda_> and the people that want you to talk like that are almost never people that actually HAVE something they struggle with, they're just woke types
[1:07:30] <heart_ablaze> I call my meds "happy pills"
[1:07:32] <%Lilgamba> It's like a debuff in an RPG, but the debuff is permanent
[1:07:33] <%G_Thunders> It probably stems from doctors and professors needing to sound, you know, professional
[1:07:34] <%Razputin217> Man I really miss George Carlin
[1:07:35] <+zeraux_> its going back in the freezer
[1:07:41] <%Agami23> fucking, i should really get stuff handled. i should probably be really medicated
[1:07:45] <Profmcstevie> You don't say "atypical" for dude with no feeling in their legs, it's weird
[1:07:45] <%torusendor> Neoliberalism can't let you think things are bad
[1:07:47] <%BoxNavy> so does adhd
[1:07:47] <1matheuw> it has?
[1:07:48] <%BoxNavy> yup
[1:07:51] <SomersaultJustice> you can solve crimes like Monk
[1:07:53] <+BoltWarden> it's unfortunately indirectly made it harder to talk about mental illnesses in a number of ways
[1:07:58] <%cvp5127> you never forget anything
[1:07:59] <ergulor> benefits to others?
[1:08:03] <%goatbait> Like what?
[1:08:07] <%tizz86> aight guys I'm outta here for a bit
[1:08:09] <%toolofparanoia> ADHD sucks. I get so far behind on projects because of wandering mind... But I do love to talk about bullshit.
[1:08:09] <Badgerconda_> most of these things have -some- benefits, it's just that the shitty part MASSIVELY outweighs them lol
[1:08:12] <+Pyroclase> I hate having Autism but there are times where I hyperfocus and get shit done like you wouldn't believe
[1:08:13] <SaltyAzteca> You and her can just go at it, Ive seen the chemistry
[1:08:14] <%Ranryu692> no
[1:08:15] <xeros720> ocd really helps with programming
[1:08:16] <%BoxNavy> adhd owns when you need to hyperfocus on a task
[1:08:17] <Pookiedaexzile> This guy
[1:08:19] <%Ipsenscastle> no
[1:08:20] <leinadtonu> weaponized OCD?
[1:08:20] <1matheuw> kinda bragging
[1:08:20] <xxshadowxx416> no
[1:08:22] <austinj24> TRU
[1:08:22] <%Maids4lyfe> yes
[1:08:22] <thesugardaddy111> no
[1:08:22] <%baka_sugoi> OCD
[1:08:23] <%goatbait> Take care @tizz86
[1:08:25] <%cervidaequus> Paige knows 1000 things at once
[1:08:26] <%BallerSwagBro9k> no?
[1:08:27] <%ShawnTK_> not real;y
[1:08:28] <+Dayube> no
[1:08:28] <%anticrust> no
[1:08:28] <%Monkeyweed21> anti depressants let you last REALLY long in bed
[1:08:28] <+TungstenViper> <3
[1:08:30] <%arcielardor> HYPER FOCUS, BABY!!
[1:08:31] <+WizoSavage> cause of the goblins
[1:08:32] <%cvp5127> it has to be perfect
[1:08:33] <%McSoliace> schizo can give you super brain occasionally
[1:08:33] <%goatbait> OCD brag
[1:08:34] <%vaporousTippler> Could have been better.
[1:08:34] <fuji_92> LUL chats a asshole
[1:08:34] <1matheuw> no one notices paaaaatuh
[1:08:35] <%WhereIsWill> LUL
[1:08:35] <bettysharkface> I feel that "had to" though
[1:08:36] <%TalisKanju> Stop referring to the old era
[1:08:37] <TurtlesAndTentacles> Yes
[1:08:37] <SomersaultJustice> you were in videos?
[1:08:39] <%Ranryu692> my speakers sucked when I watched most of them lol
[1:08:39] <SomersaultJustice> Kappa
[1:08:39] <%SirGO0SE> Woolie heard that and has already taken offense
[1:08:41] <%jorniev> is tim rogers adhd?
[1:08:41] <thesugardaddy111> were messing with u pat
[1:08:41] <wembleyttv> Thing is like I kind of feel like I don't want to be the person who brags about it but if someone asks me I would just say what I have
[1:08:41] <Hydrapissed> LOL
[1:08:41] <DianaTheAscian> @PatStaresAt my tv is perfectly calibrated
[1:08:42] <+MayorRev> F L E X
[1:08:42] <%Maids4lyfe> some of us have shitty audio at home
[1:08:44] <%Agami23> ADHD is probably why i love fate and other lore heavy series. my brain stores TONS of info to ramble on about
[1:08:44] <%BallerSwagBro9k> Was it tho?
[1:08:45] <ToneBacas> mind goblins compelled you to finetune it
[1:08:47] <+zeraux_> SSRI's are fucked
[1:08:47] <marvel877> Repeatedly reading the same thing all the damn time ends up committing a lot of useless trivia to memory.
[1:08:48] <+BoltWarden> @Monkeyweed21 looool
[1:08:51] <Badgerconda_> i have complex PTSD and the hypervigilance makes me WAY more observant than everyone around me. I also have way better reflexes than most people.
[1:08:57] <austinj24> YEAH THEY DOOOO
[1:09:01] <thesugardaddy111> monkey weed is actually correct
[1:09:03] <%mister___doctor> I suffer from stupidity
[1:09:05] <%goatbait> WHAT
[1:09:05] <%Ranryu692> yes
[1:09:05] <@SSaryn> What
[1:09:07] <%baka_sugoi> ???
[1:09:08] <%augusta_wind> my friend and i were JUST talking about this
[1:09:08] <%Movemeister> give me some of them then
[1:09:11] <1matheuw> that sounds awful
[1:09:12] <%RetroCop87> MONKEYWEED REDEMPTION ARC
[1:09:12] <thesubgenius912> yes it fucking sucks
[1:09:13] <Dave_VD> It fucking sucks
[1:09:13] <DianaTheAscian> oh yeah
[1:09:16] <+reallybigrocks> SSRIs also make you get drunk as fuck off like 2-3 beers
[1:09:16] <%toolofparanoia> ..... THIS EXPLAINS SO MUCH
[1:09:17] <%DappercatEsquire> ssris can also make you not want to be in that bed at all
[1:09:18] <mybassgotblasted9000> Yo sony still has not refuned cyberpunk and its refuned website is broken XD they dont even send confirmation emails
[1:09:18] <RyanGelatin> just coom more bro
[1:09:19] <+TungstenViper> because orgasm is a form of mania?
[1:09:20] <%supergoblinpunch> Yes I fucking do
[1:09:21] <$RealThiele> ddepression dick
[1:09:22] <SaltyAzteca> Is that....safe?
[1:09:22] <+BoltWarden> @Monkeyweed21 mhmm
[1:09:25] <austinj24> AND THEY FUCKIN SUCK
[1:09:27] <Dave_VD> Makes you hella self conscious
[1:09:27] <%AzureGale> Fascinating
[1:09:28] <wembleyttv> Having sex is good for antidepressants
[1:09:28] <karovus> my antidepressants had the opposite effect lol
[1:09:29] <thesugardaddy111> see for me it just takes longer but for some people just can't nut
[1:09:31] <%Maids4lyfe> @Agami23 is that why I can't forget random trivia and but never remember a person's name I just me ten minutes ago?
[1:09:33] <TheTakkster> They can make orgasm borderline impossible
[1:09:33] <%Monkeyweed21> its actually a bit of a problem it takes like 60 to 90 minutes
[1:09:40] <marvel877> @TungstenViper hah, hysteria joke.
[1:09:40] <+gimmickypizza> Can't not tho
[1:09:40] <Hydrapissed> sooo thats why Im 5 seconds fast and then cry
[1:09:41] <%TheCallousKing> Serotonin
[1:09:41] <%baka_sugoi> Sad PP Powers
[1:09:41] <%eyezehuhh> depression super power
[1:09:42] <%anticrust> Pat, I'm on SSRIs, why am I still a horney fucking idiot?
[1:09:43] <%DappercatEsquire> CHEMICAL LIMITERS ENGAGED
[1:09:49] <%vaporousTippler> So it's like a compressor filter for a microphone.
[1:09:49] <+WizoSavage> theres a prescribed medicine for schizophrenia that can make you lactate
[1:09:51] <cimturry> bruh i dont even get good emotions NOW!? wtf
[1:09:52] <EldritchNeko> I have a dissociative disorder and it can be really helpful in crisis situations
[1:09:53] <%goatbait> Dumb down, ah so I'll understand thanks pat
[1:09:54] <%BoxNavy> EDGE cases ;)
[1:09:54] <Sapphire_Breeze> Doktor, release my inhibitors
[1:09:57] <SulfurousAcid> You just get flatter
[1:09:58] <%PigGuy800> my adhd helps with extra energy when i need it
[1:09:59] <Profmcstevie> You still bounce about, you just don't bounce that far
[1:10:01] <%AncelDeLambert> meaning that if you're already a functional depressive, they don't do SHIT
[1:10:03] <%BallerSwagBro9k> Thats sounds......scary
[1:10:08] <%McSoliace> but sad PP
[1:10:10] <@SSaryn> Oooooh
[1:10:11] <thesugardaddy111> so everything just kinda melds to5
[1:10:12] <+TungstenViper> @marvel877 was not a joke, i was genuinly curious
[1:10:13] <+BoltWarden> makes sense
[1:10:15] <rindoesstuffnthings> life compressors
[1:10:15] <%Maids4lyfe> anti depressants made me have numb boners
[1:10:16] <mybassgotblasted9000> @PatStaresAt Yo sony still has not refuned cyberpunk and its refuned website is broken XD they dont even send confirmation emails
[1:10:18] <%BoxNavy> fuck that forever
[1:10:18] <%AncelDeLambert> YEP
[1:10:20] <+WizoSavage> let's go
[1:10:20] <+Dova573> HUH?
[1:10:22] <%torusendor> Just do LSD
[1:10:23] <@SSaryn> Ok that makes sense
[1:10:23] <%vaporousTippler> Doktor. Turn off my emotion inhibitors.
[1:10:23] <fuji_92> @anticrust you can get horney, it's just gotta take longer to bust
[1:10:25] <Hydrapissed> get wet
[1:10:26] <+shry7> yeah....
[1:10:26] <OldManDeckardCain> PRESCRIBED BLUE BALLS
[1:10:27] <thesugardaddy111> but I still can and I take them
[1:10:27] <%AncelDeLambert> it becomes HUGELY difficult to reach climax
[1:10:29] <Pookiedaexzile> Now that's a trade
[1:10:29] <%RetroCop87> edge for hours
[1:10:33] <thelonechris> Is that why my nuts have remained unbroken?
[1:10:34] <sammie779> So what happened to the sound on the first 2 episodes of DP 1?
[1:10:36] <%torusendor> Helped me lol
[1:10:37] <+BoltWarden> 'busting'
[1:10:38] <%wibbwobbler> prescribe ssri and forget about it
[1:10:39] <%Divryne> EDGE.
[1:10:39] <%arcielardor> yup
[1:10:39] <austinj24> 3 HOURS FAM
[1:10:39] <Pookiedaexzile> What type of Monkey's Paw bullshit
[1:10:40] <+Dova573> ohhhh
[1:10:41] <%toolofparanoia> ... fuck...
[1:10:42] <@SSaryn> waow
[1:10:43] <thesugardaddy111> but I can do it tho
[1:10:44] <%Maids4lyfe> SO THAT'S WHAT IT WAS
[1:10:45] <Laecerelius> Bust a nut through your chemical limiters
[1:10:45] <ToneBacas> mind-fuck tag
[1:10:45] <fuji_92> edging drugs
[1:10:45] <%McSoliace> don't say get wet ever again
[1:10:49] <%Ranryu692> I tried ecstasy for the first time while on anti-depressants, and the e didn't work lol
[1:10:56] <%RetroCop87> erectile overdrive
[1:10:58] <%anticrust> Its only like a little harder (pun intended) for me
[1:11:00] <%GarbageNirvana> On escitalopram, can confirm
[1:11:01] <+hottbutts> nah, ill take being sad and orgasming to completion for $400, Alex
[1:11:02] <%eyezehuhh> that explains a lot for me...
[1:11:02] <TurtlesAndTentacles> Weed Does that to me
[1:11:05] <%Emperor_Machinus> @PatStaresAt I like this talk, it's very interesting
[1:11:07] <%toolofparanoia> Welp my mind has been blown.
[1:11:08] <leinadtonu> Damn cat...
[1:11:08] <CloniiCory> That actually explains waaaaay too much regarding my sessions when I was like 13 lol.
[1:11:11] <thesugardaddy111> it just makes it take longer for me
[1:11:12] <%Monkeyweed21> the downside is that if you run out of Anti-depressants you get REALLY horny
[1:11:13] <%supergoblinpunch> Never heard anyone talk about this before
[1:11:13] <%jorniev> BUSSTING
[1:11:15] <BerryliciousDefinition> That hat makes sense...
[1:11:17] <marvel877> Remember the Mercenary Kings video?
[1:11:18] <+shry7> @GarbageNirvana same bro
[1:11:20] <%Agami23> microsoft has updated. now you need to reset the setting again that ruins the podcast
[1:11:23] <%baka_sugoi> so if a person is on antidepressants and then takes the drugs is that a bad
[1:11:24] <+Dova573> Erectile OVER DRIVUUUUUUU
[1:11:24] <1matheuw> @RetroCop87 its the opposit to e disfunction
[1:11:26] <+reallybigrocks> One thing I noticed coming off SSRIs was that I felt fucking amazing for like 3 days as my brain gobbled up all that excess serotonin
[1:11:28] <Midnight188> id rather not bust a nut but have my brain work than be able to bust one but maybe also just die?
[1:11:31] <%goatbait> Yeah, never heard this stuff before and it's super interesting
[1:11:41] <%BinaryFireball> most of the time its fine
[1:11:46] <%BinaryFireball> most of the time
[1:11:47] <%jorniev> BUSTING IS HARD!
[1:11:51] <%BinaryFireball> some of the time

[1:12:13] <+Katamori777> BibleThump
[1:12:14] <@commanderclaw> And then you end up chafing
[1:12:15] <%AncelDeLambert> "they list off the side effects" lol haha no
[1:12:17] <%eyezehuhh> but the bustin is supposed to make the feel good
[1:12:19] <+Over_ninek> oh that sounds like an awful idea even from a layman's POV
[1:12:23] <blastazoid00> RIP
[1:12:27] <thesugardaddy111> so then the kid can't nut so he just spanks it like ALL THE TIME
[1:12:28] <+BoltWarden> it doesn't cause me much trouble 'solo' but it makes 'fun times with a partner' while wearing protection, very nearly impossible
[1:12:28] <Sapphire_Breeze> ! DICK AT RISK !
[1:12:28] <%TundraOW> Pulling rope Sadge
[1:12:29] <+TungstenViper> FeelsBadMan

[1:12:33] <%goatbait> That sounds super scary for a kid
[1:12:35] <%BigCoffee> ED
[1:12:38] <%wibbwobbler> the ONE thing
[1:12:41] <CloniiCory> I was on Concerta too at the time Pat, which you should not mix with Anti-Deppresants, I have a permanent Nervous Tick due to it.
[1:12:42] <ape_hawk> when will fat pat play hair witch game?
[1:12:43] <%BoxNavy> muh ropes jermaPluto
[1:12:44] <%Monkeyweed21> you can still masturbate but it takes like 2 hours
[1:12:46] <%baka_sugoi> Hmmm
[1:12:47] <Pookiedaexzile> This week on Dick or Depression
[1:12:47] <+Dova573> thats so fucked
[1:12:48] <Badgerconda_> This sounds like Pat has personal experience
[1:12:49] <%supergoblinpunch> But you're pulse races
[1:12:50] <wembleyttv> Ted talk
[1:12:50] <ToneBacas> it sounds very much so
[1:12:50] <BerryliciousDefinition> oof
[1:12:53] <%McSoliace> fuck that to hell
[1:12:54] <marvel877> and thus, BINKY DICK PAT WAS BORN.
[1:12:55] <thesugardaddy111> this stream is super weird and I love it
[1:12:58] <Profmcstevie> when my equipment malfunctions and you're 13?! yeah fuck that you'd think you were broken
[1:12:59] <Fien111> Yeah, your panic attack starter being broke is NO FUN
[1:13:00] <%anticrust> ADD meds
[1:13:01] <ManfredA> almost as irresponsible as giving children basically meth
[1:13:01] <%Bailey__gaming> owch
[1:13:05] <%Ranryu692> long-release adderall
[1:13:05] <bettysharkface> ADHD meds
[1:13:05] <chicken_apostle> ADHD medication
[1:13:07] <+zeraux_> i really should get mental gears checked out sometime
[1:13:08] <+reallybigrocks> I'm glad I knew about a lot of the side effects before hand due to having friends that used SSRIs
[1:13:08] <%BigCoffee> concerta is adhd meds
[1:13:08] <thelonechris> Can Dr. Pat be a weekly thing?
[1:13:11] <TurtlesAndTentacles> I had a antibiotic that did something similar to me
[1:13:11] <%skyentombment> Hey Pat, what happened in that mysterious cut in Bully? You said that wouldn't be revealed until you got drunk at a panel, but it hasn't happened so far
[1:13:12] <%AncelDeLambert> long story short: we need to focus on therapy as a public, already, goddammit, and stop not covering it with insurance
[1:13:12] <+Pyroclase> Concerta is an alternative to adderal
[1:13:12] <Hydrapissed> Busting makes me feel good
[1:13:14] <Hydrapissed> do od do dododo
[1:13:15] <%eyezehuhh> glad i tuned in early
[1:13:16] <+TungstenViper> Bustin makes me feel good
[1:13:17] <1matheuw> finna busta a nut
[1:13:19] <%WhereIsWill> ghostbusters with the FACTS
[1:13:20] <%toolofparanoia> Fuck me, I'm getting off my sertraline. Fuck that shit
[1:13:21] <cimturry> battling your chemical barrier sounds radical
[1:13:21] <%LonePlus_> uh oh
[1:13:22] <+reallybigrocks> Busting DOES make me feel good
[1:13:22] <ManfredA> Concerta is basically meth
[1:13:22] <thesugardaddy111> bustin makes me feel good
[1:13:23] <+LionKagura> BUSTIN
[1:13:23] <%LonePlus_> no bust
[1:13:26] <@commanderclaw> Psychopharmacology is a grey zone at the best of times, it's more of a dart board than anything
[1:13:28] <EldritchNeko> I got misprescribed lithium once shit was weird
[1:13:31] <%McSoliace> that's horrid
[1:13:32] <1matheuw> oh no nut machine bust
[1:13:33] <+TungstenViper> bustin bustin bustin
[1:13:35] <+Gespens> It wasn't brain stuff, but I remember taking a pill to help supress my violent acne as a 14 year old, but the pills caused all the muscles in my back to violently tense up for three hours and I couldn't move and my life was pain
[1:13:37] <+Pyroclase> I was on concerta for years before learning I don't actually have ADHD
[1:13:43] <%baka_sugoi> bust NUT
[1:13:44] <1matheuw> or rather didnt bust
[1:13:44] <%Kduff89> speaking of mania. being manic you want to bust. LIKE ALL THE TIME.
[1:13:47] <%goatbait> What's that?
[1:13:49] <CloniiCory> Concerta is a demon in a little white pill lol.
[1:13:50] <%vivaldiva> One of the worst things about ad's is having massive emotional moments and feeling the chemical block. Happened with some family health things recently where I didn't feel as shitty as i thought i should, which made me feel even worse
[1:13:59] <marvel877> Chemicals are not as interesting as Woolie would like to think.
[1:14:02] <Badgerconda_> shit's really hit or miss because there's so many variables and we don't have a good understanding of most of them still.
[1:14:10] <%toolofparanoia> You want super cocaine ADD drugs?... Vyvanse
[1:14:11] <ManfredA> ADHD meds made me into a zombie kid who couldn't eat
[1:14:11] <%Emperor_Machinus> Oh I had that happen! Not the dick thing, but the quiet panic attack. Got into a full breakdown that broke through out of sheer frustration
[1:14:17] <@commanderclaw> I'm speaking from the side of being treated rather than being the caregiver to be fair
[1:14:19] <Badgerconda_> We don't even know that though because you can't measure brain levels of serotonin in a living person
[1:14:20] <creepywoody> It's not like fighting the barrier, you just dont get off at the end and it sucks.
[1:14:21] <1matheuw> why not tho?
[1:14:35] <%SirGO0SE> @toolofparanoia thats what ive been prescribed for years. shit works
[1:14:37] <leinadtonu> I've read the side effects of some of migraine pills, they sound gnarly.
[1:14:37] <austinj24> Uppers woooo
[1:14:38] <dinnydanny777> There are things you can do to boost serotonin though
[1:14:49] <%Rumbutt> If you can't make your own seratonin, store bought is... fine...?
[1:14:49] <%KineKithZen> It is now dependent on serotonin.
[1:14:53] <%KineKithZen> At abnormally high levels
[1:14:55] <+TungstenViper> NO SHIT
[1:14:56] <%AncelDeLambert> whaaaaaaa?
[1:14:56] <+eanscrale> Usually serotonin blockers are more common now, because of that.
[1:14:58] <+reallybigrocks> Also you gotta be careful doing stuff like LSD or MDMA on SSRIs because you can overload yourself on serotonin and maybe die
[1:15:00] <+cgreene64> @patstaresat speaking of wild ass meds they give to teens ACCUTANE has insane side effects
[1:15:00] <Badgerconda_> it's waaaaay more complex than that.
[1:15:00] <%toolofparanoia> @SirGO0SE Gets shit done
[1:15:01] <fuji_92> psychopharmacology really is, and it's hard to study that shit cause how you're gonna test shit in ppl without fucking em forever
[1:15:01] <%BoxNavy> monkaS
[1:15:02] <%Fooguwu> Be careful of amphetemines if you have any issues with muscle tension, like "armoring" from PTSD. I've been physically disabled for a year after 3 months of taking Vyvanse prescribed
[1:15:06] <1matheuw> who woulda thought that teh brain is complicated
[1:15:11] <sammie779> sammie779 subscribed at Tier 1. 
[1:15:18] <Badgerconda_> Serotonin is also involved in TONS of different things in your body, and pills that mess with it can fuck up lots of other things.
[1:15:18] <%AncelDeLambert> naaaaaaaah I don't believe that, unintended consequences? Getoutaheah
[1:15:21] <+eanscrale> so that the juice that you can make stays in longer as oppsoed to giveing you more
[1:15:26] <OldManDeckardCain> FUCK IT, we get paid by each drug sold anyway
[1:15:27] <dinnydanny777> Isn't there a serious problem with ADHD kids being misdiagnosed
[1:15:29] <+WizoSavage> reminds me how Gabe Newell said that the brain isn't as complicated as it seems in regards to chipping ourselves in the future
[1:15:30] <%baka_sugoi> Trwo ater on it
[1:15:33] <%BoxNavy> HOW DO YOU PUT OUT A GREASE FIRE monkaS
[1:15:33] <%goatbait> Russian roulette?
[1:15:34] <thesugardaddy111> what kind of water can we put on this
[1:15:35] <SulfurousAcid> TRUEEEEEE
[1:15:35] <%Kduff89> LUL
[1:15:36] <blastazoid00> Yeah, basically
[1:15:37] <Brother_Coduss> @PatStaresAt so, should i be worried that i have recurring days where all i want to do is lay in bed and wonder "what the fuck's the point of anything because it doesnt matter?"? it tends to happen in the summer months, and I'm usually fine in the winter
[1:15:38] <@commanderclaw> My brain is like a grease fire sometimes, it's true
[1:15:44] <Profmcstevie> Smother with Mayo? nope. ketchup? Nope. rollin pin? Nope. This sucks
[1:15:45] <%BoxNavy> oh
[1:15:47] <1matheuw> yea thats how you get a fireball
[1:15:48] <%wibbwobbler> suicidal thoughts as a side effect for anti depressants is unreal
[1:15:48] <%AncelDeLambert> you cover it with a lid
[1:15:48] <cimturry> throw a bunch of flour on it
[1:15:50] <%MidnightBurst12> can't make water
[1:15:50] <wembleyttv> Don't you have a wet a cloth?
[1:15:51] <ToneBacas> don't cut off your oxygen
[1:15:51] <%baka_sugoi> put a lid on it
[1:15:51] <%BoxNavy> so you eat the grease
[1:15:51] <TG_Cid11> somter it with backing soda
[1:15:53] <%TinyLittleDancer> Yeah, we've been working on new therapies for recalcitrant MDD including Dopamine channel agents and even utilizing more specific receptor uptake agents
[1:15:54] <DianaTheAscian> oh
[1:15:54] <thelonechris> You start another fire
[1:15:54] <thesugardaddy111> fire extinguisher
[1:15:55] <wembleyttv> Or is that another one
[1:15:55] <%arcielardor> baking soda or sand
[1:15:57] <MetalDeerS0LID> salt puts out a grease fire
[1:15:57] <leinadtonu> throw sand on it.
[1:15:59] <%goatbait> When the brain goes a little too much burrr
[1:16:00] <%GalacticaPhanto> weed has been the cheapest anxiety and depression medicine than the one I'm normally prescribed
[1:16:01] <%Agami23> i noticed recently im an unconscious drinker. which is weird.
[1:16:01] <+TheotherKristian> Stomp on the fire
[1:16:04] <ergulor> a wet blamket
[1:16:04] <%DappercatEsquire> @patstaresat isn't is still kinda not known why SSRIs work, we just know that they do?
[1:16:05] <%shurtal> baking soda
[1:16:06] <bakkatohri> But what if the grease fire is actually a baby? Does it still work?
[1:16:06] <%Kduff89> my god. I am dying rn with how much this truth is hitting me
[1:16:07] <DionDrawsx5> I have been prescribed a load of things, but I've I'm on a medium dose of Venlafaxine.
[1:16:07] <+MooseIsGoose> so thats how you fix depression. cut off the oxygen
[1:16:09] <%AncelDeLambert> or, use ANOTHER pan
[1:16:09] <+BoltWarden> or sand
[1:16:10] <%Monkeyweed21> the worst part about being suicidally depressed is growing up and being told that you cant tell anyone or else you'll be committed to a mental ward
[1:16:10] <%baka_sugoi> idk about blanket
[1:16:10] <+TungstenViper> WET blanket
[1:16:11] <%goatbait> Towel?
[1:16:12] <heart_ablaze> pat honestly should just do psychology educational streams and get big profit
[1:16:12] <T_Sasquatch> yea just put a lid on fire
[1:16:13] <thesugardaddy111> FIRE EXTINGUISHER!!!!
[1:16:13] <creepywoody> Throw a fire extinguisher on it, got it
[1:16:13] <%Fooguwu> throw a fire extinguisher on it ya
[1:16:14] <+Katamori777> Piss on it
[1:16:15] <%Paperware> Throw the whole extinguisher? Got it!
[1:16:15] <@commanderclaw> @Brother_Coduss Look up Seasonal Affective disorder
[1:16:17] <%McSoliace> a heavy blanket might
[1:16:17] <+Carquar> You can just throw water on a grease fire
[1:16:17] <%spitelite> damp towel
[1:16:18] <+cgreene64> there are fire blankets
[1:16:19] <+Gespens> It needs to be a fire blanket
[1:16:19] <%captainpodock> sawdust
[1:16:20] <%maskofmichael> Run away and forget about it
[1:16:21] <BleedinActionMan> Reminds me of that one comic where a girl goes to the future and everyone is small rooms hooked up to IVs
[1:16:22] <1matheuw> throw gasoline on it to burn the oxigen faster
[1:16:23] <%super_ej8> the correctly rated fire extinguisher!!!
[1:16:23] <%sammie779> You noticed me, Senpai!! psaUp
[1:16:23] <+Pyroclase> remember, water only puts out fires because it cools it down, water isn't magic anti-fire juice
[1:16:24] <%OfficioPrefectusCorgi> Powder one
[1:16:25] <%MidnightBurst12> fire blankets exist
[1:16:26] <%TundraOW> Cut off oxygen to fix the depression
[1:16:27] <%Emperor_Machinus> Replace the air with more gas ^ JOKE
[1:16:27] <jellssssss20> @PatStaresAt Have you heard anything negative OR positive about Doom Eternal on switch?
[1:16:27] <orangezeus759> come for the bayo stay for psych talk
[1:16:28] <DionDrawsx5> SNRIs worked for me as I'm extra bonkers.
[1:16:29] <%BoxNavy> drink up the grease to stop the fire
[1:16:30] <%Monkeyweed21> WAP can do it
[1:16:31] <mrastro979> Cover it with my hands?
[1:16:37] <%baka_sugoi> can i throw myself on oil fire?
[1:16:43] <%mister___doctor> Wha- I heard my name
[1:16:44] <%goatbait> Eat the fire
[1:16:45] <thesugardaddy111> when is bayo?
[1:16:47] <+GuilKato> @PatStaresAt Get Blanket - Warm Nachoes!
[1:16:48] <karovus> watching pat makes my serotonin machine go brrr
[1:16:48] <marvel877> Wet blanket would have the same effect as putting just water in the grease fire, Pat.

[1:18:34] <+TungstenViper> "no, i'm dying"
[1:18:35] <%radda343> I thought "impending sense of doom" was just normal
[1:18:36] <+twohitgood> panic attack?
[1:18:39] <@commanderclaw> Psychosomatic? Jesus
[1:18:42] <%BoxNavy> wow the human brain is a fucking villain
[1:18:44] <%Monkeyweed21> oh yea I had that too
[1:18:44] <Fien111> I was super skinny kid and given Adderall and the like, despite that suppressing the FUCK out of my apatite. I was actually becoming anorexic and they refused to take me off it till I just refused to take it anymore. Made me hate psychiatrists from an early age
[1:18:44] <%anticrust> Sense of Impending Doom SNOMED Code 712759008 @PatStaresAt

[1:19:05] <%Thelivingredead> Thelivingredead subscribed with Prime. 
[1:19:15] <spawnzie> so your brain just went "wouldn't it be fucked if you died right no?"
[1:19:16] <The_Nerfed_Warrior> Yea, my heart-panic attacks almost always triggered when I was trying to fall asleep
[1:19:27] <hairtoday> ritalin jacked me up as a kid, made me super irritable
[1:19:28] <+BoltWarden> my ADHD medication used to give me occasional like really intense/sometimes painful heartbeats
[1:19:30] <%templar010> haha yeep
[1:19:30] <dinnydanny777> I took ADHD meds as a kid and I really do not think it helped me at all.
[1:19:32] <ManfredA> and yes if you're not aware people
[1:19:36] <thelonechris> Yes
[1:19:37] <blastazoid00> I had the same damn thing happen like two times. I now find out it could have been a panic attack
[1:19:37] <DianaTheAscian> my folks took me off it after a year
[1:19:38] <%templar010> YEAH
[1:19:41] <%blankwaffle> let's not talk about how adhd needs are so close to meth

[1:19:43] <tiaramaki> Oh yea, I heard of that term
[1:19:44] <+zeraux_> OOOOKAY
[1:19:45] <dots4eyes> That sounds nefarious
[1:19:45] <chicken_apostle> Sounds like a dope band name
[1:19:45] <ManfredA> panic attacks are nearly 1:1 symptom-wise with heart attacks
[1:19:46] <fuji_92> be morbid together
[1:19:46] <%MidnightBurst12> comorbitity
[1:19:47] <%baka_sugoi> comorbita wa

[1:19:51] <%Dakuu75> ok
[1:19:52] <+michelangelo_c> One of the biggest benefits of free health care is going "I think I am dying time to go check for free"
[1:19:52] <leinadtonu> I can nce had a cool episode of sleep paralysis and a massively scary nighmare/night terror...

[1:20:06] <jellssssss20> Sadly, I've tried dozens of medications, luckily I'm in Ontario so most meds are free, but so far none have worked at all
[1:20:07] <marvel877> OCD and anxiety with a touch of depression. YAY ME.
[1:20:07] <Dave_VD> Depression is co-morbid with anxiety
[1:20:11] <ergulor> yeah morbodity sounds like a realy bad thing

[1:20:14] <+hottbutts> dope ass band name: CO-MORBIDITY!
[1:20:15] <@commanderclaw> Welp
[1:20:16] <+ThomasOfTroy> Fuck yeah comorbidity, I have combined presentation of both ADD and ADHD
[1:20:19] <+WizoSavage> so it's like saying you're likely to get bronchitis cause you have a cough?
[1:20:20] <%MidnightBurst12> 3 for 1 deal on brain problems
[1:20:21] <%SirGO0SE> itd sound nicer if you said "comobigtiddi"
[1:20:21] <+reallybigrocks> Yeah depression, anxiety disorders and ADHD are all very closely linked
[1:20:24] <%TinyLittleDancer> No likelihood just having two or more conditions
[1:20:26] <%zoso_xvii> Watching from Newfoundland since the beginning. You da man Pat
[1:20:27] <%LonePlus_> I was given ADD meds in 4th grade because i just talked to my friends too much, it was bullshit and had me absolutely fucking WIRED from like 10 to 16

[1:21:43] <%SirGO0SE> 24 years ago a group of girls laughed at me D:
[1:21:43] <+Pyroclase> THOSE NEVER STOP
[1:21:43] <penitentpendant> "Oh no. I didn't study!"
[1:21:43] <%vaporousTippler> 38. Still get that one.

[1:21:46] <DianaTheAscian> OH GOD
[1:21:47] <RyanGelatin> do u still have grocery store nightmares
[1:21:48] <%cylish> The trick is to not care about being on time
[1:21:48] <+twohitgood> @dinnydanny777 most of them are controlled substances. which is why i'm not allowed to receive any of them to treat my adhd.
[1:21:49] <bettysharkface> ADHD has massive comorbidities with anxiety, depression, OCD, and drug abuse. Mostly due to late diagnosis resulting in poor coping mechanisms wooooooooo.
[1:21:50] <%G_Thunders> Only once a year???
[1:21:50] <%baka_sugoi> IM LATE FOR CLASS wait im 30
[1:21:51] <%BinaryFireball> I love the one where you think you've been skipping a class for half the semester
[1:21:51] <leinadtonu> haven't had one of those in ages.
[1:21:51] <%Ancopro> is that the true ptsd
[1:21:52] <BleedinActionMan> I had a dream last night where I was still in school
[1:21:53] <%wibbwobbler> *random yelp in the darkness to make it go away
[1:21:53] <@SoFarFetched> He fucked up his bits
[1:21:54] <tanarath> Pat, that's just your brain HELPING, so you'll watch for the things that cause it and NEVER DO IT AGAIN EVER.
[1:21:54] <@SoFarFetched> LUL
[1:21:54] <%AKAMarkTwain> Anxiety is a beeeeetch.
[1:21:55] <%Kduff89> it doesnt matter if you take sedatives to sleep cause of your horrible horrible insomnia
[1:21:58] <%LonePlus_> all of my school dreams always end with me going "WAIT I DONT NEED TO BE HERE" and i just wake up
[1:21:58] <%AncelDeLambert> late for class, it's finals, OH MY GOD I FORGOT I EVEN HAD THIS CLASS I HAVENT BEEN ATTENDING ALL SEMESTER!
[1:21:59] <%RetroCop87> or the dream where you are going the whole year missing a class

[1:22:00] <eyedntcry> oh my god i had that last night
[1:22:00] <+Pyroclase> I will be 90 years old dying in bed and still be dreaming about forgetting about a class I signed up for
[1:22:00] <+Gespens> I WENT FOR B
[1:22:01] <Ssach> Because school is nightmare?
[1:22:02] <+reallybigrocks> It's the part of your brain that evolved to run away from sabertooth tigers wanting something to do
[1:22:03] <+Katamori777> When it happens I audibly grunt due to cringe.
[1:22:03] <%vaporousTippler> It also holds true for old jobs you've quit.
[1:22:03] <+GuilKato> I finished uni back 10 years ago - I still wake up thinking OH GOD I have an Assignment due!!!!!! at least once a year

[1:22:49] <+twohitgood> @bettysharkface and if you end up with any substance abuse then you can't get most of the medication for adhd.

[1:24:25] <%Dingalow> Dingalow subscribed at Tier 1. They've subscribed for 11 months, currently on a 1 month streak! Fun story, this is one of two games that I've ever loved so much they made me cry while playing, the other was Pokemon Platinum, and I am not proud of that at all
[1:24:33] <ManfredA> Pat's thinking about that thing he did 20 years ago while peeing
[1:24:34] <@SoFarFetched> cheer500 Im gonna say right now,the worst dreams lately is when you're dreaming & people are near you. But they aren't wearing masks so you're like "OH GOD WHERE IS MY MASK,WHY IS NO ONE WEARING MASKS!? geefNLT " It fucks me up everytime but I'll have those few pleasant ones where I forget masks are currently a thing.

[1:25:23] <Weeabooninja> @Grimlockfly I can afford to watch him stream
[1:25:25] <%Alazull> @sofarfetched I feel you on that one
[1:25:28] <%cylish> @SoFarFetched welcome to my waking nightmare, I do inspections on construction sites and guess what kinda guys think masks are "attacking their rights"

[1:25:51] <ManfredA> @SoFarFetched I have to say one of the few upsides of recovering from COVID is no longer being absolutely mortified of getting COVID or terrified of giving someone COVID

[1:26:15] <%sammie779> I dream every night, it sucks

[1:28:27] <%doomunderthestairs> but pat is colorblind
[1:28:28] <dinnydanny777> Purple would look so good
[1:28:29] <@SoFarFetched> cause combine red and blue and you get purple Kappa
[1:28:30] <%BoxNavy> thats ALL we know
[1:28:32] <%doomunderthestairs> can we be sure
[1:28:34] <%Dingalow> I dunno it's been like 7 years since Bayo 3's trailer!

[1:28:55] <DionDrawsx5> PLAY THE LEG WITCH GAME
[1:28:58] <+TungstenViper> Like Sparda being Purple and Vergil and Dante being Blue and Red?
[1:29:03] <+TheotherKristian> Weird take but I hope Bayonetta Three is the last one
[1:29:04] <%toolofparanoia> @wydamn When isn't things becoming blue a papyrus joke?
[1:29:05] <%McSoliace> agreed
[1:29:06] <TheTakkster> It's blue because it's the cool one
[1:29:07] <%A_CD_By_Thomas> I'm betting 3 is gonna be about fighting Inferno, which I'm excited for because honestly we didn't get enough demon in 2, even if what we got was still fantastic
[1:29:07] <%BoxNavy> boy is it
[1:29:09] <@SoFarFetched> "wow look at this budget "
[1:29:12] <%Payterodactyl> @jellssssss20 what when?

[1:29:29] <%BigCoffee> ?
[1:29:29] <ape_hawk> luckily for pat, easy mode is selectable at the start of the game
[1:29:30] <%Plesin> Hard mode isn't even THAT hard
[1:29:31] <%TundraOW> Then what is Bayo 2's easy mode?
[1:29:32] <%vexion_smh> HUH
[1:29:32] <%Plesin> imo
[1:29:33] <Profmcstevie> Technically weaker, more fun of an adventure
[1:29:37] <%dapperdoop> the ol switcheroo
[1:29:37] <+Pyroclase> I played all the doom games on "hurt me plenty" because I didn't know any better
[1:29:39] <@SoFarFetched> this explains why I felt 2 was easier than one
[1:29:41] <%toolofparanoia> MOON
[1:29:41] <BleedinActionMan> @PatStaresAt Did they change the difficulty names? Because I explicitly remember the names being '1st, 2nd and 3rd Climax'
[1:29:44] <TurtlesAndTentacles> THAT GAME IS AUTO HARD MODE?!
[1:29:44] <+Kaiser_Loar> Cheer500 I went into the emergency room because my blood pressure was 180/90. I HAD my blood drawn and a ekg. I had no pain in my chest and now fading of vision.

[1:32:25] <%wibbwobbler> turns out people actually liked that game
[1:32:27] <Brother_Coduss> but did they awake to JUSTICE
[1:32:29] <%maskofmichael> What? No, shut up. Bayo 1 made total sense

[1:33:14] <DionDrawsx5> I agree with pat though, this game is only a little bit worse than bayo 1, but the spectacle is incredible.
[1:33:15] <+TheotherKristian> I so wish that Bayonetta was not a franchise that was constantly mired in development struggles

[1:44:17] <CloniiCory> I still love that Nintendo looked at this and went "Yes". Then Sakurai looked at this and said "Oh hell yes" Before immediately regretting it because Bayo broke the meta.
[1:44:21] <quipquest1> Did Bayo just swear?
[1:44:22] <%AncelDeLambert> @BoxNavy Dunkey, get the hell outa here!

[1:47:41] <jellssssss20> Because he stands underneath stuff on purpose shut up
[1:47:42] <%AncelDeLambert> if you looked closely, you would see that Pat had a leftover combo from the last segment. Therein is the source of farming this part of the game
[1:47:43] <dukenux> who is flying the plane
[1:47:50] <%jorniev> THIS SONG IS EARGASM
[1:47:52] <%vexion_smh> But isn't scarborough fair kinda op in two since it shoots more bullet tho
[1:47:54] <%maskofmichael> Is this game secretly about edging?
[1:47:55] <T_Sasquatch> man i feel like I should just restart bayo 1 again because i clearly do not know how to play it
[1:47:55] <%A_CD_By_Thomas> Fuck yeah
[1:47:58] <%Bt_Robot> Oooh, she said a swear!
[1:47:58] <dukenux> and why they haven't catapulted yet?
[1:48:05] <Daxalog> Rules of nature?
[1:48:07] <%goatbait> Did they ever explain why bayo's guns are gone?
[1:48:08] <SaltyAzteca> faster!
[1:48:11] <dukenux> @maskofmichael >secretly
[1:48:13] <%BoxNavy> jermaVenus
[1:48:16] <%A_CD_By_Thomas> Goddamn those QTEs are so much faster oh my god I forgot about that
[1:48:18] <BleedinActionMan> They also made the mashing way easier @PatStaresAt
[1:48:19] <+superchronicc> here comes better jeanne
[1:48:21] <%AncelDeLambert> @Futurecity10 he's a Fallen Angel, formerly a general of Heaven or something
[1:48:22] <%vexion_smh> Bayo's dt
[1:48:24] <dukenux> Jeanne Pog
[1:48:24] <%baka_sugoi> dante n vergil
[1:48:24] <giogio346> i heard it makes torture attacks useless
[1:48:25] <MackFighters> WHO'S FLYING THE PLANES
[1:48:26] <jellssssss20> Why can they control it by standing on it?
[1:48:26] <+BoltWarden> top gun reference?
[1:48:26] <dinnydanny777> PogChamp
[1:48:28] <%weissguard> Rodin may or may not be a "Satan". Cause he's a fallen angel in the first game, and more demonic here, iirc.
[1:48:29] <+alphonseisbest> LESBIANS

[1:48:40] <Daxalog> Platinum sure does love having something that flies as a first boss
[1:48:40] <TurtlesAndTentacles> So I should buy this game, again for switch , Got it
[1:48:41] <%BoxNavy> oh nooo
[1:48:42] <%Bt_Robot> Do they ever explain how they are piloting these jets?
[1:48:42] <%Dakuu75> is she saying "fuck off" or "flock off" during the weave attack?
[1:48:43] <Flame_Water> Pat not worried about music?
[1:48:49] <Fien111> The planes fly because they know better than to anger Bayo
[1:48:50] <DionDrawsx5> This is like, the green hill of character action game first levels...
[1:48:51] <jellssssss20> I feel like "Because magic hair" is the answer to everything in this game
[1:48:53] <dan_g_v> this is the final level of most character action games
[1:48:53] <dukenux> You know... Bayo is blue now... and she still collects golden rings...
[1:48:54] <%Agami23> man you were right pat, this game IS alot more colorful. i love it.
[1:48:55] <%toolofparanoia> Magic Lesbians
[1:48:55] <%A_CD_By_Thomas> Yep
[1:48:59] <%Bailey__gaming> BUZZ OFF
[1:49:02] <%AncelDeLambert> remember, kids, Satan and Lucifer are NOT the same person (depending on denomination)
[1:49:04] <jellssssss20> NEVER LOOK AT THAT AGAIN
[1:49:05] <%BallerSwagBro9k> IM LOVING THIS COLOR PALLET
[1:49:06] <SaltyAzteca> but does it still affect grade?
[1:49:07] <%BoxNavy> did you not get them in 1?
[1:49:08] <+chiazam> Thank god
[1:49:14] <DrkJP520> Fucking headbutt!!
[1:49:14] <SaltyAzteca> Oh instant use!
[1:49:15] <+Goblinz_3> God it's so busted
[1:49:16] <+pectusumbra> Wait were they not sisters or whatever?
[1:49:18] <%Savarro> This is easily one of my favorite opening levels ever
[1:49:19] <+chiazam> The game needed heal drops
[1:49:20] <BleedinActionMan> And also, they no longer penalize you for using items
[1:49:20] <Udongein_1> yea the way they gave out laurels in bayo 1 felt counterintuitive
[1:49:25] <DianaTheAscian> I noticed damage taken seems higher
[1:49:27] <dinnydanny777> Hey there was a bit there that sounded like the 1dt games music
[1:49:35] <spawnzie> i do love how much of Madama Butterfly we get to see
[1:49:39] <%Monkeyweed21> @pectusumbra they're """sisters""""
[1:49:40] <%Deft_Thought> I never got to play Bayo 2 because I didn't own a Wii U
[1:49:41] <%FrozenSpaceFrog> I'll never forget how Nintendo advertised this game in a issue of Playboy
[1:49:42] <%arancet> man i need to play this again, its so fucking good
[1:49:43] <KnightAsteran> MADAMA BUTTERFLY IS THE FUCKIN COOLEST
[1:49:45] <+Goblinz_3> This game really does a great job at making you feel completely overpowered from the first game]
[1:49:46] <dan_g_v> diana he's playing in hard
[1:49:46] <+TungstenViper> Tomorrow is mine is so good
[1:49:48] <%N0bdyNoOne> He's missing the PAT within
[1:49:52] <jellssssss20> You didnt dodge that giant air snake perfectly come on Pat Kappa bitterSweet
[1:49:53] <%RetroCop87> Pat's playing on hard
[1:50:08] <Udongein_1> it uses magic now tho so it's kinda wasteful
[1:50:16] <%A_CD_By_Thomas> Nice
[1:50:16] <%Dakuu75> RiP that pilot
[1:50:17] <tengel66> I'm glad they minimized the torture prompt on screen
[1:50:20] <spawnzie> HEY YOU SEE HOW THERE WAS NO INSTA DEATH QTE?
[1:50:21] <%AzureGale> *presses F for pilot*
[1:50:22] <+superchronicc> high frequency claws
[1:50:24] <wragglee> goodbye, that one pilot
[1:50:24] <Profmcstevie> ....so that was verse 1 of the whole game
[1:50:27] <%Dingalow> Here's a cool easter egg I remember. If you hit the dodge during a cutscene dodge, the fight will start in Witch mode
[1:50:28] <%A_CD_By_Thomas> I GOTTA BELIEVE
[1:50:30] <jellssssss20> Bayonetta: THE WORLD
[1:50:31] <dukenux> You gotta BELIEF
[1:50:31] <mike2hands> you just gotta belief
[1:50:32] <%goatbait> A train is more economical than a plane anyways
[1:50:32] <SulfurousAcid> gold Sadge RESTART
[1:50:33] <%coffeebearCafe> wow this is way cooler than the 1st game lol
[1:50:33] <DianaTheAscian> cool

[1:50:39] <SaltyAzteca> Re6*
[1:50:45] <%BoxNavy> ;)
[1:50:47] <BleedinActionMan> There is precisely ONE instant death in this game
[1:50:49] <spawnzie> THAT is the kind of QTE i want
[1:50:52] <jellssssss20> All of those dodge qte's were hidden
[1:50:53] <marvel877> Don't worry, I saw the pilot get out with the parachute. Totally happened.
[1:50:54] <+Over_ninek> already 4 new enemies
[1:50:57] <%TinyLittleDancer> What does this look like for everybody else in the city? Did bayo do 9/11?
[1:50:59] <thelonechris> Hoobastank?
[1:51:03] <Brother_Coduss> so why are the angels super gross clockwork monsters
[1:51:04] <%BoxNavy> secret qtes are great
[1:51:04] <jellssssss20> that was like 3 or 4 in a row lol
[1:51:05] <quipquest1> Oh god, this will take YEARS to fix
[1:51:06] <dukenux> Mashing too hard
[1:51:06] <wragglee> hes too good he says LOL
[1:51:06] <%AncelDeLambert> ur a peach, Jeanne
[1:51:07] <SuperRafiMan> I did not know that lol
[1:51:19] <+chiazam> I really bayo 3 doesn't have a mission select in between Verses
[1:51:22] <%BoxNavy> bitrate WutFace
[1:51:23] <%Bt_Robot> HOW ARE THEY CONROLLING THOSE PLANES?!!
[1:51:25] <MackFighters> that's a long bridge
[1:51:26] <+superchronicc> WutFace
[1:51:32] <Idon__> Did they change Bayonetta's moveset going from 1 to 2?
[1:51:32] <dinnydanny777> My twitch is not coping with this speed LUL
[1:51:33] <Gutsandlove> ah yes the Valiantium Blade angel
[1:51:34] <+vampireinarm> M A G I C
[1:51:41] <%AncelDeLambert> @PatStaresAt how do you rate the swords in this game?

[1:51:47] <Fien111> @Bt_Robot sheer lesbian charisma
[1:51:47] <DrkJP520> High octane insanity
[1:51:54] <%goatbait> I'm surprised that angels just do not care for collateral damage
[1:51:55] <jellssssss20> The bridge is collapsing behind them lol
[1:51:59] <%AncelDeLambert> tru'nuff
[1:51:59] <+chiazam> They're so fast
[1:52:01] <%Nekros4442> God both of their hairstyles are so much better in 2

[1:52:12] <wragglee> dang, caviar? they really are rich
[1:52:13] <+pectusumbra> Is Bayo the 1%
[1:52:14] <+superchronicc> caviar for christmas
[1:52:17] <+vampireinarm> the fastest battle in mid air
[1:52:22] <%Dingalow> That hidden QTE also works for lollipops, if I recall
[1:52:22] <%mister___doctor> Bayo and her big booty goth gf fight God
[1:52:25] <dukenux> man the Nintendo money this game got really shows
[1:52:26] <+Pyroclase> This brige is doing a Quantum Break.
[1:52:27] <%baka_sugoi> Caviar with black truffle
[1:52:28] <%AncelDeLambert> Alright, chat, choose your fighter: Hammer or Sickle as best heavy weapon of the game?
[1:52:29] <thelonechris> So this is like dozens of 9/11's happening
[1:52:30] <+Pyroclase> Remember Quantum Break?
[1:52:33] <dinnydanny777> I've never had caviar but it doesn't sound nice
[1:52:34] <%Plesin> sbfpYeyeye

[1:52:53] <%Ne1son> Is the mashing easier in this game? @PatStaresAt
[1:52:56] <dinnydanny777> This is really cool PogChamp
[1:52:58] <jellssssss20> @PatStaresAt If 1 was Angels and 2 is Angels and Demons, what will 3 be? Primordials?
[1:53:00] <DrkJP520> The angel sounds like a creepy baby
[1:53:01] <+WizoSavage> I like this Goku and Vegeta Jotaro bullshit
[1:53:03] <%goatbait> This is still only on switch, right?
[1:53:08] <%arancet> mashing is MUCH easier in 2
[1:53:08] <%M4T1A5> Why would people live in cities in the Bayo universe as it seems any one bayonetta goes into will get completely fucked
[1:53:20] <%Dakuu75> wtf is she saying there?

[1:54:39] <quipquest1> Did she get her soul punched out of her?
[1:54:41] <Idon__> WINGS PogChamp
[1:54:43] <braincraft> You know what they did in Sodom? You don't even want to know what they did in Gomorrah.
[1:54:45] <%MechArch> is this just a mario game?
[1:54:48] <susukouhai> this is y u never play devil games
[1:54:51] <%AncelDeLambert> keep in mind, regular people can't SEE the dragon. They just see the skyscraper melting
[1:54:55] <jellssssss20> Why can she just fly, with or without the wings
[1:54:58] <%jorniev> HER BODY IS STILL SIDEWAYS BTW
[1:54:59] <%Dakuu75> why did her hair-dragon suddenly deside to betray her?
[1:55:00] <KeiPrime> cant believe jeanne's fucking dead, again
[1:55:00] <%A_CD_By_Thomas> @quipquest1 Basically, yeah
[1:55:00] <huskarl_zap> jump into the mouth
[1:55:11] <+Over_ninek> Bayonetta only got serious in her second game
[1:55:16] <%TimetodiveLTX> looks like this game runs pretty well on cemu
[1:55:19] <+Goblinz_3> She can use the eye from the first game now so she's pretty overpowered
[1:55:21] <dukenux> So now both demons and angels are enemies?
[1:55:24] <%TimetodiveLTX> i'll check it out
[1:55:27] <KnightAsteran> @dakuu75 bound and broke free
[1:55:29] <jellssssss20> Also the skyscraper is melting in like under a second
[1:55:30] <+superchronicc> how many casualties?!
[1:55:32] <%goatbait> Do you think normal people hear the elephant noises?
[1:55:32] <+Kitafin> thsts a good amount of health
[1:55:35] <+Mecha_G> @Dakuu75 because plot
[1:55:41] <%Kduff89> question. Does this mean vore is one of Kamyia's fetishes?
[1:55:43] <Idon__> Would be real bad if Madame Butterfly decided to betray yer.
[1:55:46] <KnightAsteran> @superchronicc enough
[1:55:47] <%Dingalow> Man, Platinum Games do be good at sticking final boss shit at the start of the game
[1:55:52] <%A_CD_By_Thomas> Can you punch his fireballs back like Fortitudo?
[1:55:52] <%TheBensonator_> become as vore
[1:55:53] <jellssssss20> Since we're beating the stuff's terminal velocity
[1:55:54] <SulfurousAcid> imagine getting hit qkuroSmug
[1:55:57] <%baka_sugoi> sbfpSetIn
[1:55:59] <T_Sasquatch> i just noticed this game doent have a style meter
[1:56:02] <dinnydanny777> Is Bayonetta doing cartwheels in midair LUL
[1:56:02] <%AncelDeLambert> @Idon__ impossible, Madama is solid AF
[1:56:02] <DianaTheAscian> I just realized he has 2 heads
[1:56:06] <%MechArch> gotta save peach, i mean jeanne
[1:56:06] <%TimetodiveLTX> couldnt be me
[1:56:12] <GrimHeaper323> damn this man can mash
[1:56:13] <+PkSilent01> So all the demon Bayo uses are borrowed demons from hell?
[1:56:15] <jchmxlupus> @dakuu75 They will talk about that in a little bit. But its basically the balance of heaven, hell and human world is getting messed up currently.
[1:56:17] <jellssssss20> Did she already have a contract with both?
[1:56:20] <%TheBensonator_> FKN OUCH
[1:56:24] <GrimHeaper323> Yea PK
[1:56:26] <%baka_sugoi> ORE ORE ORE
[1:56:27] <Idon__> Yeah I don't think Platinum games do style meter, just the points
[1:56:27] <dukenux> ORA ORA ORA
[1:56:35] <%Grimlockfly> But for real, Holy Shit this is the first level.
[1:56:39] <%McSoliace> first level by the way
[1:56:43] <+Mecha_G> did she headbutt it?
[1:56:44] <T_Sasquatch> this is the FIRST LEVEL
[1:56:52] <%Dakuu75> @jchmxlupus mm, thanks.
[1:56:53] <garryjohanson> how cool will it be if nmh 3 and bayo3 came out in the same year.
[1:56:54] <giogio346> the flying combat is kinda meh
[1:56:54] <%AncelDeLambert> @PkSilent01 Bayo is kinda special in that she can summon SO MANY. Umbra witches have to make contracts with each demon they want to summon, and the stakes get higher every time
[1:56:56] <+Goblinz_3> Money shot
[1:56:58] <%A_CD_By_Thomas> Out with the old, in with the new
[1:56:59] <+chiazam> gotcha
[1:57:06] <%goatbait> They're still falling...
[1:57:07] <T_Sasquatch> Any other game this would be a final boss LUL
[1:57:08] <%BoxNavy> that shot is awesome
[1:57:09] <jellssssss20> FAIL
[1:57:10] <%BallerSwagBro9k> YEHYEYEYEY
[1:57:12] <%AncelDeLambert> both joysticks, Pat, remember to use both

[1:57:19] <CanadianAnimatorGuy> timmy
[1:57:19] <wragglee> ill fix it by summoning another one!
[1:57:20] <%weissguard> She looked right at the player there.
[1:57:22] <Idon__> and now THIS one betrays you
[1:57:22] <Udongein_1> Labolas
[1:57:22] <thelonechris> Bob
[1:57:23] <jellssssss20> Isn't it Cerburus
[1:57:24] <hamborgini> let's just call him teostra
[1:57:24] <+Goblinz_3> Better doggo
[1:57:25] <Vyneci> Labolas?
[1:57:25] <AdmiralButtloaf> Argento?
[1:57:26] <%weissguard> Never noticed that.
[1:57:29] <IminyourBase> so they kill the old summon to indicate that this is INDEED bayonetta 2
[1:57:31] <%torusendor> That's just a behemoth
[1:57:32] <Ssach> Nice BGM
[1:57:33] <%RetroCop87> Wait, does this mean we get to fight Phantom AGAIN?
[1:57:34] <Essixian> tomatoPain
[1:57:34] <spawnzie> Labolas
[1:57:34] <%baka_sugoi> its zangief
[1:57:34] <garryjohanson> chat if nmh3, bayo 3, smt5, and mhw rise all come out in the sme year is nintendo oficially edgy?
[1:57:35] <%McSoliace> ARBAGARBO
[1:57:36] <%arcielardor> The demon DICKSLAYER
[1:57:37] <DrkJP520> Zangief

[1:57:40] <%A_CD_By_Thomas> Oh fuck
[1:57:41] <%BinaryFireball> was that a GOLD medal?!?!
[1:57:41] <%A_CD_By_Thomas> It he
[1:57:43] <%Kduff89> after gamorah getting free isnt it a bit risky to summon an even bigger drago?
[1:57:45] <+PkSilent01> @grimheaper323 so Gorrmorah is a demon controlled by her not a summon made by madama butterfly
[1:57:46] <%Dingalow> I love how the prompts still look like Wii U button prompts
[1:57:47] <+chiazam> Why would Gamora go beserk like that
[1:57:49] <+BlackJack607> Scooby

[1:57:55] <%AncelDeLambert> aaaaah, my Lumen Pawn, how nice to see you
[1:57:57] <CloniiCory> Platinum stuff ranks you after the fights generally I think? At least I remember Bayo, MGR, and Transformers doing that.
[1:57:59] <jchmxlupus> @pksilent01 Yup, she borrows or summons them. And it seems listen more than others
[1:58:02] <wragglee> big losers

[2:08:35] <dinnydanny777> @dukenux Pat/chat said it was Norway though...?

[2:08:43] <+BoltWarden> POP
[2:08:44] <thelonechris> Pat no
[2:08:48] <%goatbait> Ugh..I want this game, but that nintendo price
[2:08:48] <%Nekros4442> Chat no
[2:08:51] <%BallerSwagBro9k> A,loli?
[2:08:52] <CureMode_> is this on switch
[2:08:53] <BleedinActionMan> @PatStaresAt Unlike 1, you are not penalized for using items in 2
[2:08:56] <%BoxNavy> why does this game fuck the bitrate so hard
[2:08:57] <KnightAsteran> lollypop you shitters
[2:08:57] <DionDrawsx5> It runs badly when emulated too.
[2:08:57] <%TheBensonator_> Alla dat aliasing
[2:09:00] <Saltmeisterr> yeah this looks pretty crust
[2:09:00] <+Pyroclase> because it's a huge open cityscape probably
[2:09:01] <%JusTTheGuyYouNeed> this looks like a sonic 06 area
[2:09:01] <%Dingalow> Pat likes lolis
[2:09:03] <LorcaNomad> it's cuz wii U right
[2:09:06] <%Piemono> Go splash in the wada
[2:09:08] <%pineapplepervert> chat yes Kappa
[2:09:08] <%eyezehuhh> portilloBeCool
[2:09:11] <%bhp_99> yeah nintendo switch
[2:09:11] <dukenux> @dinnydanny777 they were on their way to norway, but crashed. ...well, Enzo did
[2:09:14] <%goatbait> @CureMode_ yep, switch and wiiU appparently
[2:09:15] <%BallerSwagBro9k> @goatbait get Fitgirl repack on PC
[2:09:16] <%A_CD_By_Thomas> Although the Sage'll call ya out on it in your fights LUL
[2:09:17] <%Dakuu75> Sonic 06 ruined, these kinds of scenic areas for me
[2:09:21] <+teh_rawk> is madame a stand?
[2:09:23] <%cylish> I enjoy the lack of shit filter
[2:09:23] <fuji_92> her shadow is soo cool
[2:09:28] <%wibbwobbler> bayo 3 on switch would be interesting
[2:09:30] <%TalisKanju> If you get it Physical you get a code for Bayo 1
[2:09:31] <BleedinActionMan> @PatStaresAt 2 being easier might be a side effect of Kamiya not being in charge
[2:09:32] <%Srthunda> is your shadow madamme butterfly?
[2:09:34] <%TimetodiveLTX> sonic 06 was good
[2:09:36] <Profmcstevie> You still have to be good at the game to get your no damage, fast kills so who cares
[2:09:37] <ManfredA> Madama is a summon
[2:09:40] <dinnydanny777> @dukenux I guess that makes more sense
[2:09:42] <%TimetodiveLTX> kidding
[2:09:46] <+chiazam> Blind
[2:09:46] <NeroIscariot12> I think the Bayo 1 port is based off the PC version which was just better optimized than Bayo 2 that was developed solely for WiiU
[2:09:48] <+TheBitingIrish> Maybe that was one of the things they changed because it was a Nintendo exclusive, but Nintendo didn't catch?
[2:09:52] <+TopTieramisu> this area does gives me sonic 06 vibes
[2:09:58] <Mucmaster> You're not penilized for using items?! I guess I was a dumb ass for not using them when I played
[2:10:01] <+vanareus> @srthunda ye
[2:10:05] <+teh_rawk> is bayo the coolest summoner?
[2:10:09] <%rumtumtugnutz> @teh_rawk I think Bayo is a stand.
[2:10:15] <dukenux> @dinnydanny777 as much as Venice in the middle of central asia
[2:10:26] <$RealThiele> they rrejected god but tiddies
[2:10:43] <DrkJP520> If you take damage, you're getting a lower score anyway so... But then again, aren't there like invulnerability lollipops?
[2:10:51] <%A_CD_By_Thomas> Get ready for lots of platforming challenges
[2:10:58] <Clundy> I wonder if Bayo 2 chugged on WiiU
[2:11:02] <Parapattern> This place is JUST Spagonia

[2:14:15] <BleedinActionMan> @Idon__ They're a lot more sensible. Way less backtracking, most of them are just really well hidden
[2:14:16] <SomersaultJustice> if you use the link costumes, are the witch hearts heart pieces?
[2:14:20] <dinnydanny777> Bayonetta's underwater run animation looks funny
[2:14:28] <Idon__> That's good
[2:14:28] <%Futurecity10> its been cringe for the last 3 years
[2:14:29] <%maskofmichael> witch hearts to power the lady parts
[2:14:29] <+TheBitingIrish> Some of them

[2:16:31] <BleedinActionMan> @dinnydanny777 Absolutely, Bayo did it
[2:16:32] <%MechArch> journals read quick
[2:16:32] <%Monkeyweed21> Bayo is insulated by her unshaved puss
[2:16:36] <$RealThiele> glass cutters on
[2:16:37] <%Paperware> And then you start to hear the sonic drowning theme
[2:16:52] <dinnydanny777> @bleedinactionman Yeah but she's got super powers
[2:16:55] <%RetroCop87> Is Luka always gonna drop these "I know a witch who..." bits in his reports?
[2:16:59] <thelonechris> Baked gex
[2:17:01] <DrkJP520> During the witch hunts it was believed that witches would float on water, so it's interesting how Bayo sinks like a rock.
[2:17:02] <huskarl_zap> grass flavoured gecko

[2:18:15] <%SirGO0SE> he LOVES the diaper froth
[2:18:16] <KnightAsteran> Bayo in Kiryus suit is too powerful an image
[2:18:17] <Blank9> she's going to umbran climax to work that froth up with a big multiplier
[2:18:19] <@SoFarFetched> Is it because Pat's diaper is frothy
[2:18:19] <CloudCircus> @patstaresat has Paige done Bayonetta cosplay?
[2:18:20] <+Mecha_G> Bayo should have had a Zero Suit cosplay in the Nintendo port
[2:18:22] <ManfredA> @Plesin she is Joker's mom after all
[2:18:24] <rosemon5001> @RealThiele but whatt if tho he evolved into a high hecko LUL HahaThink

[2:19:30] <+BaekTheHeck> is that just a porb
[2:19:34] <%A_CD_By_Thomas> @Ranryu692 I'd imagine at the very least it's taking long because it might(?) be the end of the saga and they want to make it as awesome as possible

[2:23:47] <+TopTieramisu> @TopTieramisu :)
[2:23:53] <%Dingalow> @TheBitingIrish Yeah exactly, it's like Bayo 2 was a monkey's paw wish for those people
[2:24:03] <DionDrawsx5> He's just petting the dog...
[2:24:04] <+BoltWarden> @RealThiele why... god... why...
[2:24:14] <@SoFarFetched> Excuse you Bayonetta lost her "cousin" geefPlz
[2:24:18] <%Nekros4442> So apparently Woolie got a colour called referring to him in Thems Fighting Herds called "Shout of Sea"
[2:24:19] <%Monkeyweed21> whats worse, diaper fetish or colostomy bag fetish @RealThiele
[2:24:20] <+GuilKato> Zangief needs to be on stream more
[2:24:24] <%BinaryFireball> its called art Bolt
[2:24:28] <%A_CD_By_Thomas> @Mecha_G To be fair, she said the same thing to Rodin in 1. I think she prefers that Rodin just sit back and sell her guns instead of coming in to help her personally
[2:24:40] <$RealThiele> bag festish seems messier
[2:24:46] <%Kduff89> @Monkeyweed21 both? both is good
[2:24:58] <+Mecha_G> what does he even do with those halos?
[2:25:00] <+GuilKato> possibly a second camera stream of zangief also on the stream
[2:25:17] <%Monkeyweed21> @Mecha_G he needs them to defeat eggman
[2:25:18] <$RealThiele> on the flipside you could get diaper rash on your dick LUL

[2:25:28] <+GuilKato> @Mecha_G I assume he's using them as sextoys or making curtain rings?
[2:25:28] <+TheBitingIrish> TAKE A PICTURE, YOU FOOL!
[2:25:29] <jeffishype> please i beg you sir
[2:25:31] <%Futurecity10> Pat fuck you for retweeting that Majima WAP

[2:25:56] <+Mecha_G> amiibo?
[2:26:07] <dukenux> I'm Bat...
[2:26:09] <%A_CD_By_Thomas> @Mecha_G I think he uses them to recover his angel powers, at least in 1. Could be wrong. Also I think they go for a fortune down in Inferno
[2:26:13] <dinnydanny777> Not so secret techniques
[2:26:14] <+Mecha_G> what do amiibos unlock?
[2:26:15] <%logoth_> Tetsuzanko
[2:26:20] <+BubbaRands> Stiletto?
[2:26:21] <%Paralurx> Paralurx subscribed at Tier 1. They've subscribed for 33 months! When's the mission where Bayonetta protects Dante from knowing what sex is?
[2:26:25] <+superchronicc> not taking damage seems fair
[2:26:27] <%Dingalow> Costumes probably
[2:26:30] <DrkJP520> I think it's haloes
[2:26:38] <$RealThiele> pat sympathizes with bats as he also uses echo location
[2:26:39] <%A_CD_By_Thomas> MORE CITY BREAKING
[2:26:43] <%Metaknightmarex> Costumes and halos both
[2:26:43] <BleedinActionMan> @PatStaresAt They either give you halos or unlock costumes, depending on which one you use
[2:26:44] <Saltmeisterr> pat when are u gonna add urself to botw?
[2:26:45] <NitronStreams> amiibos probably just give random consumables
[2:26:48] <%Monkeyweed21> they let you see Bayonetta's amiibos
[2:26:55] <%Dingalow> There are Metroid, Zelda, and Mario costumes in this, after all
[2:27:05] <%A_CD_By_Thomas> Platinum's sure on a city damage binge recently
[2:27:05] <%Dingalow> Bayo 3 should have a Kirby costume
[2:27:07] <%Monkeyweed21> its like the streets of Montreal
[2:27:09] <%VoidBaronJules> Shakin, Bain, booty Quakin, roll it around
[2:27:13] <stirlingw17> oh no it's DMC reboot levels
[2:27:16] <+Mecha_G> @Dingalow Metroid, but no Zero Suit
[2:27:18] <+TheBitingIrish> Pat, u seriously don't have your Twitter linked in the info?
[2:27:22] <dukenux> Amiibo? more like: ah might buy em... yeah
[2:27:24] <i_am_therydon> i remember on the old channel you made a joke about slippy toad. something about him not being born made you lose it
[2:27:27] <+GuilKato> those are godly barrels
[2:27:30] <%RetroCop87> This place is a bit scala ad caelum
[2:27:31] <%honeyman18> What's the collateral damage in a Bayonetta fight? Seems like a lot.
[2:27:34] <+GuilKato> since they have angel halos in them?
[2:27:35] <%Kduff89> @Dingalow better yet just be able to play as kirby
[2:27:39] <+TheBitingIrish> @Dingalow Nah, a Kirby WEAPON
[2:27:42] <dinnydanny777> SourPls
[2:27:47] <%Dingalow> @Dingalow I know, it's upsetting :(
[2:27:54] <+BoltWarden> panther-form a BT from Death Stranding??
[2:27:58] <%Monkeyweed21> noatun is wat better than Vigrid
[2:28:04] <%TimetodiveLTX> kirby summoning ritual
[2:28:04] <+BaekTheHeck> do haloes factor into rank calculations in this game like dmc 3 and 4
[2:28:06] <DianaTheAscian> i'm glad this game has color
[2:28:10] <+Over_ninek> head canon is that they use time powers to revert all the damage from these battles
[2:28:11] <+GuilKato> not a witchheart
[2:28:12] <stirlingw17> Wait is the fact bayonetta doesn't float a monti python reference?
[2:28:16] <%Dingalow> @TheBitingIrish King Dedede's Hammer and the Galaxia
[2:28:33] <+Mecha_G> there should be a Sectonia weapon
[2:28:38] <%AzureGale> Sacrifice enemies to put more time on the clock
[2:28:45] <NitronStreams> does japan even know Monty Python?
[2:28:45] <%A_CD_By_Thomas> @stirlingw17 LUL Maybe. Could just be a perk of her Umbran Witch powers
[2:28:51] <+TheBitingIrish> @Dingalow No no, just literally Kirby as a weapon
[2:28:55] <%honeyman18> @Over_ninek I mean, they trashed the Empire State Building so I hope it goes back or something
[2:29:21] <%logoth_> Saving it for the second swallow
[2:29:24] <Saltmeisterr> wats umbran climax? i just got here
[2:29:26] <%Metaknightmarex> @stirlingw17 Witches sink according to most lore, Salem witch trials etc
[2:29:26] <+TheBitingIrish> @stirlingw17 Holy shit, I hope so
[2:29:27] <%SomeSageAdvice> wowie zowie a witch heart
[2:29:29] <%Dingalow> @TheBitingIrish That would be quite adorable lol
[2:29:30] <MetalDeerS0LID> i like how at the end of this game you get the Scarborough fair, which while uglier combo better than love is blue
[2:29:38] <+GuilKato> witches believe in organ donation?
[2:29:40] <%rekinom> Did we reach the part where Bayonetta calls us her little pogchamp yet?
[2:29:43] <Cai_Behr> I can't remember because it's been a long time since I played, but are the secret missions here as insane as Bayo 1?
[2:29:50] <danteftw20> they really messed up by balancing the game around witchtime
[2:29:53] <%A_CD_By_Thomas> @Saltmeisterr New power up in 2 where all of Bayo's attacks have Wicked Weaves to them
[2:29:55] <+Mecha_G> I love the shotguns
[2:29:59] <%Plesin> @Saltmeisterr Basically all of your attacks become suped up weaves.
[2:30:02] <+GuilKato> we cannot see it
[2:30:03] <+TheBitingIrish> TWEET IT

[2:32:14] <+GuilKato> he believes in the heart of the caards
[2:32:14] <stirlingw17> wait does that mean the big bad of the first game was just Pegusis
[2:32:15] <fuji_92> you chain of memories
[2:32:16] <+GuilKato> or is gambit
[2:32:16] <+Goblinz_3> They can't beat the duel monster champion

[2:32:17] <+Mecha_G> I missed Bayo's three-point landing
[2:32:17] <redhotlinknlog> Come now Yuguboy
[2:32:17] <Cai_Behr> There's also a fun fact in that, since the DMC3 manga is canon, until they retcon it, Bayo and DMC can't be the same world, because DMC doesn't have a heaven
[2:32:17] <+Cobaltor_252> where's his Duel Deck

[2:41:06] <huskarl_zap> OH NO ITS THE STARKILLER STANCE
[2:41:07] <+Over_ninek> "How dare you!"
[2:41:08] <%Deft_Thought> I don't get how Paradiso can be confident after you literally punched God's soul INTO THE SUN
[2:41:08] <+Mecha_G> dude has to hold hos face up to see
[2:41:16] <ThatGuyThunder> When I eventually die, I want my face put on a sword.
[2:41:17] <%torusendor> Look at that STANCE
[2:41:17] <dinnydanny777> Reverse grip LUL

[2:41:27] <%radda343> I love how he tries to dump expositiona nd she just shoots him
[2:41:28] <+MayorRev> reverse grip is epic
[2:41:29] <%Mahbonk> grabby grabby
[2:41:33] <%A_CD_By_Thomas> So I guess the forces of Paradiso are still aiming to resurrect Jubileus, is the implication there
[2:41:34] <$Afterman_> that got bird the drip
[2:41:34] <%dapperdoop> ow my sword face
[2:41:37] <%BoxNavy> birdie

[2:42:08] <+MayorRev> @PatStaresAt this game makes my fingers hurt after playing it for an hour, do you ever have the same deal?
[2:42:26] <%A_CD_By_Thomas> Fuck yeah
[2:42:26] <+DeRedBaron> tbh this guy gives me super big Angi/Rudra vibes with the design
[2:42:27] <ManfredA> you can also keep your sword charge via dodge offset

[2:42:39] <%MidnightBurst12> she big
[2:42:40] <%Deft_Thought> Did she just sword-fuck him
[2:42:42] <%Plesin> @PatStaresAt if you could make one change to the umbran climax, what would you do
[2:42:43] <DianaTheAscian> cool
[2:42:45] <penitentpendant> "Stop stabbing yourself, Stop stabbing yourself."
[2:42:46] <+BoltWarden> lmaao... it got styled on HARD

[2:43:10] <%A_CD_By_Thomas> I can't get free!
[2:43:13] <BleedinActionMan> @PatStaresAt Valiance's journal entry has a nice little reference in it
[2:43:13] <+GuilKato> @PatStaresAt you need a second camera that just stares at zangief sleeping spot
[2:43:14] <%Broand> you get to start at hard difficulty?
[2:43:16] <+Goblinz_3> Nothing
[2:43:17] <Noogiez> thats a good dream right there
[2:43:19] <+MayorRev> "i can't get free" ResidentSleeper
[2:43:19] <%baka_sugoi> bird
[2:43:21] <%BoxNavy> kill loki
[2:43:26] <%A_CD_By_Thomas> That sounds good
[2:43:33] <fuji_92> welp by bird
[2:43:34] <+Dayube> thats how paige feels seeing you
[2:43:35] <+TheBitingIrish> Sucks to suck, Loki
[2:43:37] <%SaiyanShoto> Bayos design in 2 is so much better, I love it
[2:43:41] <%rekinom> He's thinking about Elmo's mcnuggies
[2:43:45] <+Goblinz_3> I mean yeah since they're absolutely not worth using over umbran climax LUL
[2:43:46] <raveous> I mean aren't the torture attacks good for building combo points at least
[2:43:46] <dinnydanny777> See ya Loki LUL
[2:43:47] <+Mecha_G> He can't get free!
[2:43:56] <%A_CD_By_Thomas> Damn
[2:43:58] <%AzureGale> F
[2:43:58] <$Afterman_> i usually like long hair but she does look better with short hair
[2:44:02] <+MayorRev> just dont get hit
[2:44:03] <%MidnightBurst12> ded
[2:44:05] <+TungstenViper> did GOW really steal Loki from Bayo2?
[2:44:06] <DianaTheAscian> F
[2:44:11] <%Plesin> Ngl that would actually be a good change because torture attacks are totally useless in 2 unless you are facing like one enemy
[2:44:18] <$Afterman_> @TungstenViper yes. they suck
[2:44:33] <0mnis_edge> read the sword guys enemy info.
[2:44:38] <+Goblinz_3> But you already have busted weapons that you can make even MORE busted
[2:44:48] <dinnydanny777> I like how Bayonetta teases the enemies for missing in Witch Time
[2:44:51] <+Mecha_G> was that a "don't get hit" challenge?
[2:44:53] <%A_CD_By_Thomas> Oh my god I forgot about some of the Notenheim missions oh god some of these are gonna be an ass pain
[2:44:55] <Udongein_1> they're no longer rewarding to do when you can just unga bunga with UC
[2:44:58] <%Mahbonk> more like Bustonetta
[2:45:02] <%SirGO0SE> me naughty :)
[2:45:05] <%SaiyanShoto> For a second I thought Pat blew a kiss to the camera and was immediately frightened
[2:45:06] <+MayorRev> lewdd
[2:45:06] <EynosStyles> Is the game shorter then the first bayou?
[2:45:11] <%A_CD_By_Thomas> I can't get free!
[2:45:12] <BleedinActionMan> Pat, chat has made their opinion quite clear, but what do YOU think of Loki?

[2:48:54] <dukenux> George was jut a kid, tho
[2:48:57] <+MayorRev> Is this on PC?
[2:48:58] <+BoltWarden> weird
[2:49:01] <%MechArch> george was weirdly offensive
[2:49:04] <susukouhai> YE U DONT GET TO CALL HER LOVE
[2:49:04] <+Goblinz_3> Savaged
[2:49:05] <%baka_sugoi> BURN
[2:49:07] <+battlebeast67> George doesn't hang around Raiden as long though
[2:49:08] <DionDrawsx5> Random brown kid to fill Platinum Games diversity quota?
[2:49:08] <%Mahbonk> at least he aint Luka from Wonderful101
[2:49:09] <DianaTheAscian> damn
[2:49:09] <%MidnightBurst12> cold
[2:49:10] <%Plesin> Loki does enough in this game, he doesn't exactly have a place to expand from here.
[2:49:11] <Run44forrest> Revengeance 2 ?
[2:49:14] <%BoxNavy> i will always remember george and the kid with the guyanese accent that isnt even remotely guyanese
[2:49:15] <$RealThiele> smol pp has no name
[2:49:16] <devanmuse> the guy whose subtitles they needed to subtitle
[2:49:17] <LorcaNomad> Sadge
[2:49:19] <%baka_sugoi> @MayorRev switch
[2:49:20] <@commanderclaw> That face?
[2:49:20] <+Mecha_G> get that boy some aloe vera
[2:49:21] <+Xombor> Wouldn't it be cool if they made a Bayonetta 3?
[2:49:26] <%crimsonharvest> every time someone says 'cereza' and i parse it as 'cherry' it doesn't land that hard
[2:49:34] <+Mecha_G> @devanmuse too British
[2:49:36] <%SomeSageAdvice> Revengeance too* @Run44forrest
[2:49:38] <%SirGO0SE> FeelsBadMan
[2:49:38] <+Goblinz_3> Bayo 3 Forever
[2:49:40] <%Paralurx> dominant 1000 year old witch gfs are high tier shit
[2:49:44] <%RetroCop87> that FEEL, Pat
[2:49:49] <MarvelousMrD> important question, if bayonetta is a old boomer does she know how to use a computer or a cellphone
[2:49:50] <%shurtal> Sure thing, Prince
[2:49:53] <Run44forrest> hggPain
[2:49:53] <+MayorRev> ohhhh i thought there was a PC port
[2:49:56] <EynosStyles> I wonder if we can go to hell in bayo 3
[2:49:58] <%Meidolaon> Ah yes the better Bayo
[2:50:03] <devanmuse> @mecha_g is that what his dialect was supposed to be?
[2:50:03] <$RealThiele> Blouses value went big up
[2:50:04] <%Deft_Thought> Why live if no 1,000 year old Witch GF woolieKICKDAD
[2:50:13] <%BoxNavy> not me :)
[2:50:13] <rosemon5001> holy chemicals HahaThink LUL
[2:50:14] <+MayorRev> I hope pat gets the chain chomp, her taunt with it is so good
[2:50:16] <NitronStreams> DO YOU LIKE CRAFIFTING
[2:50:17] <Parapattern> Why don't you purify yourself in the waters of Lake Minnetonka?
[2:50:35] <%FacetiousAF> you. did it.
[2:50:39] <%A_CD_By_Thomas> @EynosStyles I'm certainly hoping the plot of 3 is about fighting Inferno. I need more of this series's demon designs in my life
[2:50:48] <%Monkeyweed21> purify these nuts
[2:50:50] <%barkon345> barkon345 subscribed at Tier 1. They've subscribed for 18 months, currently on a 17 month streak! considering how good you are at Devil May Cry I was really looking forward to the day you would play Bayonetta. and so far these playthroughs have not disappointed.
[2:51:00] <Saltmeisterr> TRY TO KEEP UP
[2:51:04] <%SirGO0SE> i hope the plot of 3 is about bayos huge ass
[2:51:06] <Udongein_1> TWY to keep up
[2:51:14] <Gutsandlove> why does everyone hate the kid characters in videogames, unless the kid does exactly what they are told?
[2:51:21] <NitronStreams> YOURE TOO SLOW
[2:51:22] <$RealThiele> i too want to see more ass
[2:51:26] <fuji_92> you missed a bird, but I dont those are important Kappa
[2:51:31] <NitronStreams> COME ON STEP IT UP
[2:51:35] <dinnydanny777> This is Bayonetta's game you're just playing it
[2:51:39] <+MayorRev> birds are for lore yea?
[2:51:40] <Profmcstevie> Cos kid characters are usually helpless or egotistical cunts, both unfavourable
[2:51:53] <stirlingw17> Boy use your arrows
[2:51:57] <Run44forrest> You can’t tell me this kid isn’t a shit
[2:51:58] <redhotlinknlog> children should be seen not heard
[2:52:07] <+MayorRev> this is myt favorite verse arena
[2:52:17] <%SirGO0SE> @stirlingw17 +2
[2:52:23] <%Plesin> Also I'm all for making this game easier with climaxes and all that but items having *no* effect on rating makes it a little too easy sometimes
[2:52:28] <Gutsandlove> but adult characters are that too sometimes and people still like those
[2:52:28] <0mnis_edge> 25 birds unlock an accessory.
[2:52:29] <%Plesin> Easy to get a good score
[2:52:30] <%A_CD_By_Thomas> Goddamn that wreath
[2:52:42] <EynosStyles> @gutsandlove I think it's cause they either play up the acting, or they act to mature for they're age. they can't get it right.
[2:52:51] <$RealThiele> planet unicorn heyyyy
[2:52:55] <Mangahero18> Whats the point of consumables in this game anyway? They are only really helpful on higher difficulties but using them massively brings down your ranks so people are interested in playing on higher difficulties WOULDNT USE THEM ANYWAY.
[2:53:01] <%FacetiousAF> tomorrow is mine Kreygasm
[2:53:04] <%Mahbonk> vig boy
[2:53:04] <+Goblinz_3> Oh yeah the sword is the unicorn LUL
[2:53:06] <%A_CD_By_Thomas> Fuck yeah this guy
[2:53:07] <%Mahbonk> *big
[2:53:09] <+Goblinz_3> I thought it was the bird
[2:53:11] <rampagedxrecon3> yay patt stream
[2:53:16] <+MayorRev> yeyeyeyeye
[2:53:16] <Meltgar> PUNCHY MC PUNCHISON
[2:53:17] <Gutsandlove> @eynosstyles I can agree to that
[2:53:20] <Profmcstevie> How is it easy to get a good score when you still have to take low/no damage and be fast with good combo score to get your medals
[2:53:22] <%Dakuu75> it's Urban-Youth~
[2:53:25] <$RealThiele> oh no urban violence
[2:53:33] <%nosubstancex> nosubstancex subscribed at Tier 1. They've subscribed for 38 months, currently on a 38 month streak! Much love from Brandon P and Maribel O
[2:53:57] <%tank7013> @Gutsandlove Adults face consequences. It's very rare that a child character is punished for being a shitlord beyond being forced to give a half assed apology
[2:54:07] <%Dakuu75> "sawnic BEWM"
[2:54:10] <%dapperdoop> lot of hooved angels here now that I think about it
[2:54:11] <%Plesin> @Mangahero18 I have never once been penalized for using items in 2. Only in 1.
[2:54:21] <%honeyman18> they're so gross when the armor breaks
[2:54:25] <%FacetiousAF> only golds for pat
[2:54:28] <Mangahero18> Seriously?
[2:54:32] <+Goblinz_3> Perfect run ruined
[2:54:38] <Mangahero18> They dont bring down your score like in 1?
[2:54:45] <%Kduff89> glod only run
[2:54:45] <+BoltWarden> I think pat is justified in back-sassing Bayo's sass, seems like he's been a damn effective conductor thus far
[2:54:48] <BleedinActionMan> @Mangahero18 They do not
[2:54:50] <redhotlinknlog> arms
[2:54:56] <$RealThiele> we kratos
[2:55:01] <EynosStyles> @tank7013 I think it has more to do with plot. if the kid has something to do with the plot, they make them to mature
[2:55:05] <DrkJP520> I think there's a hidden verse back where you found Loki under the rubble.
[2:55:12] <Mangahero18> Well I take it back then. Consumables in Bayo 2 are OP.
[2:55:12] <%Plesin> @Mangahero18 Nope.
[2:55:18] <heatrashes> uhnHug uhnHug hello everyone
[2:55:36] <+BoltWarden> her kitty is soaked now...
[2:55:37] <%BoxNavy> i mean, you dont have to use the comsumables.
[2:55:41] <+AngriestAngryArtist> PURE PLAT!
[2:55:42] <%Dakuu75> does the under-water-fighting feel different than on land?
[2:55:45] <%BoxNavy> though i agree they should dock score
[2:55:46] <%Mahbonk> Clap
[2:55:49] <EynosStyles> @tank7013 if they don't belong to the plot they really shouldn't be in the game
[2:55:52] <%tank7013> @EynosStyles Not only that, but being important means you have to deal with them the whole time
[2:55:54] <%Kduff89> you.......... did it
[2:55:54] <%Tyrimat> good jorb pat
[2:55:58] <%BoxNavy> you...... did it/
[2:56:05] <+MayorRev> :O
[2:56:11] <+Goblinz_3> KEEP GOING
[2:56:14] <%BoxNavy> yeah but go
[2:56:20] <Profmcstevie> Explore for our secrets! LETS GET GOING!
[2:56:21] <dinnydanny777> Only Bayonetta should tell you to keep going
[2:56:22] <heatrashes> uhnH
[2:56:23] <Mangahero18> If you need to use a health items and have it why WOULDNT you use it if theres no penalty.
[2:56:27] <%BoxNavy> a dragon...
[2:56:30] <EynosStyles> @tank7013 then the whole game becomes escot mission which sucks
[2:56:37] <%AzureGale> HAY GUYS WHATS GOIN ON IN THIS TOWN
[2:56:45] <+BoltWarden> recurring dergon
[2:56:47] <0mnis_edge> You know you can hold a charge while using panther.
[2:56:54] <dinnydanny777> Yeah I get it this kid sucks
[2:57:07] <stirlingw17> I'm just vibing bro
[2:57:07] <%Paralurx> Did this kid gank the millennium puzzle from Yugi Moto?
[2:57:10] <bleugh> the angel designs in this are way better than bayo 1
[2:57:14] <Valentinius_Anodyne> @Mangahero18 I mean, you still get a No Item bonus
[2:57:18] <%baka_sugoi> im just trying to get my roomates soul back
[2:57:18] <%Plesin> One thing i also don't like about this game is two of the unlockable characters can only be used in the coop mode
[2:57:20] <DionDrawsx5> Best boss in the game?
[2:57:27] <%TubeMan642> I'm just c I'm just chillin dude
[2:57:28] <Gutsandlove> yeah but, kids are like that, we were like that when we were younger, and kid can learn throughout the story and growh
[2:57:29] <devanmuse> so when these angels fuck up town in purgatorio, does it affect the real world too?
[2:57:30] <Psyramics> I wish we could get Bayo 1 with this color palette
[2:57:37] <%Plesin> One of which I understand but the other I am baffled by being unavailable
[2:57:41] <Daxalog> How!?
[2:57:42] <+TungstenViper> ???
[2:57:43] <dinnydanny777> LUL
[2:57:46] <%A_CD_By_Thomas> Yeah, kinda has that vibe
[2:57:48] <fuji_92> jow
[2:57:49] <Daxalog> Oh wait I see it
[2:57:50] <ExpressNode> Does it?
[2:57:51] <DianaTheAscian> ????????
[2:57:52] <Saltmeisterr> Really?
[2:57:57] <Shardlab> You're right
[2:57:58] <super_robo_mg> "this is just liek muh sonic game" ok furry
[2:58:00] <Profmcstevie> ....yeah, sure. Chilli dogs and all that
[2:58:00] <dinnydanny777> Preempted the people who were gonna say Kingdom Hearts good job LUL
[2:58:01] <%Ascethetic> i see it
[2:58:11] <DionDrawsx5> I kinda see it. Why not.
[2:58:12] <%Dakuu75> oh, ok
[2:58:13] <Profmcstevie> You mean a giant enemy fight?
[2:58:14] <fuji_92> oh ok, I see it
[2:58:16] <%Emperor_Machinus> Remember when Sonic and Knuckles fought an Angelic Snake dragon?
[2:58:16] <ExpressNode> I need to play it again to see what crazy man talk about
[2:58:20] <%AzureGale> Bayonetta sure loves fights on falling things, huh
[2:58:21] <rosemon5001> kinda reminds of that one god of war boss who was the building
[2:58:21] <Shardlab> The two hands trying to crush you until you bust em
[2:58:24] <braincraft> It reminds me of the first boss in Revengeance.
[2:58:25] <+Mecha_G> reminds me of Egg Viper
[2:58:26] <Mangahero18> Dont you get a bonus for not dying too? The Bonus for not dying has to be higher than no item right? If thats the case its a pretty obvious choice.
[2:58:32] <+Goblinz_3> LUL
[2:58:35] <Daxalog> Ya blew it
[2:58:36] <%Ascethetic> Sega likes giant fingers, i guess
[2:58:36] <DionDrawsx5> I was gonna say, Doomsday Zone the final phase of the fight haha.
[2:58:37] <%FacetiousAF> only golds for pat Kappa
[2:58:39] <+Mecha_G> "Get a load of this!"
[2:58:40] <godzookylives> reminds me of Metal Gear Ray in Revengeance
[2:58:42] <+Goblinz_3> Get juked
[2:58:43] <fuji_92> denied a perfect LUL
[2:58:44] <%Mahbonk> stompy
[2:58:44] <%Ranryu692> there are some people in here who seem real buttmad that Pat compared a Sega game to another Sega game
[2:58:45] <%Kduff89> ONLY..... GLODS
[2:58:45] <%WhereIsWill> damn so close to no dmg
[2:58:46] <marvel877> Tried to be the cool guy.

[3:01:03] <%ElkRiverDog> To be fair it’s an important decision

[3:01:05] <a_mad_dragon_> lara croft braid
[3:01:05] <%Meidolaon> Side ponytail
[3:01:06] <Spudnacious_Dynasty> Villainess Curls

[3:14:01] <%Tyrimat> CRAZY
[3:14:02] <%Mahbonk> @honeyman18 honestly i never thought i wanted this until now. Sounds awesome
[3:14:04] <%BoxNavy> thats crazy whatever that was
[3:14:04] <%baka_sugoi> is bayo a B cup or a C cup? serious Question???
[3:14:06] <%Bt_Robot> Librarby's
[3:14:08] <%Meidolaon> @xxshadowxx416 Ya sure Pat ain't Enzo?
[3:14:12] <Saltmeisterr> @PatStaresAt hey if witches get their power from demons, do sages get powers from angels in a similar fashion?
[3:14:12] <T_Sasquatch> @honeyman18 it wouldn't be good
[3:14:21] <%MidnightBurst12> eh
[3:14:23] <super_robo_mg> "mental brain" is right
[3:14:26] <KeiPrime> im thinkin libarbys
[3:14:29] <+BlackJack607> Look it's chunk horse angel
[3:14:45] <Clundy> Pat and Paige would be the best Bayo and Enzo costume duo
[3:14:47] <%BoxNavy> get fucked
[3:14:53] <Clundy> Pat as Bayo of course
[3:14:53] <%Tyrimat> fucking murdered that man
[3:14:53] <xxshadowxx416> @meidolaon maybe
[3:15:00] <i_love_thicc_chicks> horse angel is THICC
[3:15:12] <Idon__> oh no it's DARK Loki
[3:15:12] <%honeyman18> @T_Sasquatch okay but, post sekf destruct
[3:15:13] <Daxalog> Do sages have it better? Or is it a raw deal no matter what?
[3:15:16] <%baka_sugoi> SORA???
[3:15:16] <%A_CD_By_Thomas> Yep
[3:15:17] <$RealThiele> kid has imax
[3:15:18] <%AncelDeLambert> in fact, there's ZERO reason to believe that the deal they get isn't as raw
[3:15:19] <stirlingw17> you know Loki reminds me of the Rock Paper Scissors kid from Jojo Part 4
[3:15:23] <dinnydanny777> He looks like he should be in Kingdom Hearts 1
[3:15:36] <%AncelDeLambert> We have NOTHING to prove that Sages aren't just as fucked as Witches when they die
[3:15:38] <Saltmeisterr> TRY TO KEEP UP
[3:15:42] <%cherubs_anonymous> Is that a SHIT weapon?
[3:15:43] <Idon__> Real sick of the "TROIY TO KEEP UP" voiceline
[3:15:48] <Saltmeisterr> WILLIAM TELL
[3:15:50] <dukenux> Loki looks like such a gremlin
[3:15:50] <%barkon345> @baka_sugoi im going to say she is a B cup.
[3:15:51] <%Bt_Robot> CHEST!!
[3:15:53] <+featherlan> It's not
[3:15:54] <MetalDeerS0LID> no, it's the bos
[3:15:54] <%charp35> nah it's the bow
[3:15:57] <%jorniev> i think this is the last stage i remember of this game
[3:16:01] <BleedinActionMan> @Daxalog Witches go to hell, but they get demon powers. Sages get angel powers, but they have to work for the angels
[3:16:06] <%Bt_Robot> ANOTHER CHEST!!
[3:16:09] <marvel877> Nope. That's that dumb bow that doesn't feel too good using.
[3:16:10] <Blank9> the bow is good too
[3:16:11] <%AncelDeLambert> "No, dude, it's TOTALLY better to have your soul dissolve into the weave of Paradiso than it is to dissolve in Inferno, we promise! We're ANGELS, would we lie?"
[3:16:12] <%cherubs_anonymous> The whip is like the last weapon you get
[3:16:13] <%BoxNavy> the bow is kinda wack iirc
[3:16:15] <%Nekros4442> It's called William Tell ;p
[3:16:19] <%Futurecity10> Is Rodan Satan?
[3:16:19] <+MayorRev> secret fight!
[3:16:21] <%weissguard> When Umbran Witches die, Inferno claims their soul. Being in Inferno sucks, as we'll see. Presumably, it's the same for the sages, just with a different coat of paint.
[3:16:22] <%baka_sugoi> psaUp nice
[3:16:22] <Daxalog> Is working for angels hard? Whats the worst they could make you do?
[3:16:23] <%AncelDeLambert> THE BOW SUCKS ASS
[3:16:23] <%jorniev> OH YEAAH BUG BOW
[3:16:23] <moonmintparadise> Pat is right. That boy is so fucking forgettable..
[3:16:24] <+BlackJack607> Bayonette you have to open the kingdom hearts to save your wife from the heartless
[3:16:28] <dinnydanny777> LUL
[3:16:29] <%Bt_Robot> There was a chest by the LP
[3:16:29] <%AncelDeLambert> worst fucking weapon!
[3:16:29] <%Mahbonk> yee-haw
[3:16:29] <%Deft_Thought> Jollier... because Rodin is SANTA!?
[3:16:31] <%BoxNavy> SourPls
[3:16:32] <%twistedj3ster> he reminds me of Cortez from Timesplitters
[3:16:33] <%FacetiousAF> SourPls
[3:16:34] <%miguelrod777> LUL
[3:16:35] <%Dakuu75> are you seriouse... lol
[3:16:35] <Laecerelius> So if Rodin is a demon does that mean he's a bunch of gems under his hot human exterior?
[3:16:37] <%A_CD_By_Thomas> limesMusic
[3:16:39] <+MayorRev> ho ho ho
[3:16:39] <%Emperor_Machinus> Horsie song
[3:16:40] <%DakotaMacDoodle> he's totally Santa
[3:16:48] <dukenux> Rodin is canon Santa
[3:16:50] <%DakotaMacDoodle> Satan/Santa
[3:16:52] <KeiPrime> oh i get it william tell overture
[3:16:55] <Saltmeisterr> hey whats the correlation with demons and lps?
[3:17:02] <%BoxNavy> how kafkaesque
[3:17:02] <+MayorRev> "I FUCKING BELIEEEEEEVE"
[3:17:02] <+LionKagura> i liked his old outfit better
[3:17:03] <Blank9> that is so kafkaesque
[3:17:04] <%dapperdoop> how kafkaesque
[3:17:04] <Saltmeisterr> does rodin just want new music?
[3:17:05] <%Alazull> Franz Kafka?
[3:17:05] <%AncelDeLambert> it's Kefka, listen to him laugh!
[3:17:06] <Explodincatz> he is Franz
[3:17:06] <%FacetiousAF> kafka now with little hat
[3:17:07] <%Emperor_Machinus> Oh no it's FF6
[3:17:09] <dukenux> wow bro, that's so Kafkesque
[3:17:10] <%dapperdoop> jinx
[3:17:11] <Daxalog> Look at those Jak 2/3 guns on the wall
[3:17:11] <%jorniev> KAFKAAAA
[3:17:13] <%Dakuu75> OH-NO, it's so... BUG-SHAPPED... I don't like it.
[3:17:13] <BleedinActionMan> I want a spinoff game where we play a Rodin and fight these demons
[3:17:14] <%AncelDeLambert> WOOP WOOP WOOP WOOP!
[3:17:17] <KeiPrime> no meat touching, maam
[3:17:20] <Laecerelius> NO FOOT BOWS?!
[3:17:20] <%jorniev> ITS BUGMNA
[3:17:25] <DrkJP520> not with that attitude
[3:17:25] <+Over_ninek> Rodin is actually just a Land of the Lustrous character
[3:17:26] <%Tyrimat> I wish you could put on feet tho.
[3:17:29] <+MayorRev> amiibo
[3:17:29] <%Mahbonk> its a hat but not the one we wanted
[3:17:31] <%baka_sugoi> hawkeye
[3:17:32] <%jorniev> THATS RIGHT BUGMA
[3:17:33] <%BoxNavy> use that piece of shit bow
[3:17:33] <+MayorRev> pat use your amiibos
[3:17:36] <%M4T1A5> so feet bow is where they draw the line then?
[3:17:36] <+MayorRev> Kappa
[3:17:45] <super_robo_mg> that's a bug
[3:17:45] <%maskofmichael> @BleedinActionMan It's called Devil May Cry
[3:17:47] <%AncelDeLambert> this weapon has ASS combos
[3:17:47] <+MayorRev> Amiibos are free rings
[3:17:48] <+BlackJack607> Can you pet kefka on your feet?
[3:17:49] <%A_CD_By_Thomas> @Saltmeisterr The holiness of the songs attracts demons thirsty for angel blood, and then Rodin goes down to Inferno, beats the shit outta one of the good ones, and turns 'em into a weapon
[3:17:49] <%BoxNavy> DansGame
[3:17:50] <%Kduff89> ew its a boog
[3:17:54] <Blank9> it's poison DoT
[3:17:54] <MackFighters> a monster hunter Bow
[3:17:54] <Mangahero18> I wish I could play this on PC. I thought after Bayo 1 came to steam it would be a sure thing at some point but NOPE. Nintendo are being stupid pieces of shit as usual.
[3:17:58] <Idon__> ew bug bow
[3:17:58] <$RealThiele> some ravana-ass bow
[3:17:59] <%cherubs_anonymous> It's not great
[3:18:01] <SleepyMaribo> its super op though
[3:18:03] <dukenux> ohh i get it
[3:18:03] <NitronStreams> PEW PEW
[3:18:04] <jorniev> ITS A GUN
[3:18:06] <%AncelDeLambert> that charge shot is basically ALL this weapon has going for it
[3:18:08] <stirlingw17> DMC 2 the weapon?
[3:18:08] <dukenux> "Metamorphosis"
[3:18:10] <%Nekros4442> So why wouldnt you just use guns instead of this
[3:18:13] <+Over_ninek> we Monster Hunter
[3:18:15] <Blank9> the damage ticking keeps the combo running
[3:18:15] <%Kduff89> it looks like it sucks
[3:18:16] <%Broand> it's a reference to metamorphosis
[3:18:17] <marvel877> that one weapon that you'll never use.
[3:18:18] <%baka_sugoi> She Hawkin
[3:18:18] <+TheotherKristian> Poison arrows make them weaker to attacks, fun weapon
[3:18:20] <T_Sasquatch> Im still impressed she has foot guns and they aren't dumb as fucl
[3:18:21] <ExpressNode> Why now if gun tho
[3:18:23] <Saltmeisterr> @A_CD_By_Thomas damn thats raw as fuck
[3:18:25] <xxshadowxx416> @over_ninek we need 3 first
[3:18:29] <%AncelDeLambert> who the FUCK wants to wait for a DoT in a game like this??!
[3:18:30] <%BoxNavy> i cant handle that bug buzzing
[3:18:32] <%Grimlockfly> @Mangahero18 lol, when has nintendo put any games on PC?
[3:18:33] <%Standard_Enemy> Its a strange one lol
[3:18:35] <%SirKamBam> SirKamBam subscribed with Prime. They've subscribed for 6 months! Pat, looking sharp today king
[3:18:42] <rosemon5001> would have been cool seeing him fight the demons to make the weapons.....
[3:18:43] <%twistedj3ster> most bows don't
[3:18:44] <%Standard_Enemy> I really liked using it though
[3:18:49] <%BoxNavy> jermaVenus
[3:18:54] <0mnis_edge> It poisons though.
[3:18:54] <%Dakuu75> NICE timming
[3:18:57] <%A_CD_By_Thomas> @Saltmeisterr Ikr? Rodin's dope
[3:18:57] <%Kduff89> clutch
[3:19:04] <+Joe2187> @PatStaresAt The bow is used in weapon switch combos, for extenders ex damage etc like guns in DMC
[3:19:07] <%Kduff89> OOO
[3:19:08] <%Kduff89> F
[3:19:12] <%AncelDeLambert> I guess this weapon is a good mix for those SHIT chainsaws, put those on your feet and then just kite the enemy
[3:19:17] <%AncelDeLambert> but otherwise, fuck this bow
[3:19:35] <%eyezehuhh> boo this weapon
[3:19:36] <%AncelDeLambert> chainsaws are weak as fuck in comparison to the Bayo 1 iceskates
[3:19:38] <marvel877> Pat, the other guys witht the staff's powering up the hammer guy.
[3:19:44] <Valentinius_Anodyne> The chainsaws are great though
[3:19:46] <%baka_sugoi> trash bow

[3:27:54] <+MayorRev> schut the gun
[3:27:57] <%Agami23> @T_Sasquatch glamor is the thing in ff14 that lets you chose your outfits appearance. so fashion
[3:28:02] <%Kduff89> actually yeah kafka would be good here
[3:28:09] <%GarbageNirvana> These angels always tearing up houses and shit
[3:28:13] <Mangahero18> Why did that boat explode? Was it just filled with TNT?
[3:28:17] <%AncelDeLambert> Imagine living in this world, and in the last two years seeing these stories of MASSIVE cataclysmic events at holy locations across the globe
[3:28:31] <%A_CD_By_Thomas> It's why Jesus hung out with all the hobos
[3:28:35] <+featherlan> The people living in this town must be wondering what the fuck is happingg, what with all the cyclones, whirlpool and earthquakes that keep annihalating every building
[3:28:45] <Valentinius_Anodyne> Yeah, I'm not the biggest fan of Kafka, but it's pretty useful in this particular fight
[3:29:04] <%baka_sugoi> EYE OF THE STORM
[3:29:13] <%Tyrimat> Pretty cool setpiece here
[3:29:32] <huskarl_zap> FOK OFF
[3:29:33] <%Plesin> But for the rest of the game, kafka is inferior to like every other weapon
[3:29:39] <Mangahero18> This is why if I liked in this world Id be all about the Demons. Cause unlike angels that can just come down and fuck up whatever they want demons have to be summoned or let out of hell somehow.
[3:29:39] <T_Sasquatch> @agami23 ohhh i misunderstood what you meant. One of the only reasons i bothered with grand companies

[3:30:48] <DrkJP520> This is the holies looking shit ever
[3:30:51] <+justianxix> this is basically uprising
[3:30:55] <dinnydanny777> Oh that face is horrible
[3:30:59] <%dapperdoop> eyes on the inside
[3:31:00] <jellssssss20> WEll, you're kinda like, 'fuck, this'll be annoying
[3:31:01] <jellssssss20> "
[3:31:03] <+featherlan> Like, just imagine chilling in your living room, when suddenly your apartment splits in half, the severed half exploding seemingly for no reason at all
[3:31:27] <moonmintparadise> Its so cool to see that underneath those perfect faces the angels are just super gross fleshy things
[3:31:28] <K_ross> This game just feels so much better than the original to me
[3:31:30] <Saltmeisterr> god its sad they will never make a sequel to Uprising
[3:31:38] <%Plesin> ACTUALLY THIS IS TOTALLY WHY THEY GIVE YOU KAFKA
[3:31:45] <%Plesin> THEY KNEW IT WAS USELESS FOR EVERYTHING ELSE
[3:31:54] <+MayorRev> I was wondering if bayo ever says "SMASHING" in smash and then i remembered she totally did, in her reveal trailer
[3:32:05] <%ssjklyco> I bet bayo3 is gonna have a shit ton of time travel
[3:32:09] <%Plesin> SO THEY SHOEHORNED IT IN ON THE OFFCHANCE YOU'D USE IT FOR THIS ONE BOSS
[3:32:21] <+justianxix> Samurai NEEDS to make more games that arn't Smash
[3:32:25] <%jorniev> ooooh this is why you have kafka
[3:32:32] <%baka_sugoi> clutch
[3:32:35] <+justianxix> *Sakurai
[3:32:48] <DionDrawsx5> How people say they don't like this franchise is beyond me...When the 3rd boss is like...the final boss of any other half decent game.
[3:32:49] <%BoxNavy> no. samurai
[3:32:54] <%Plesin> @Saltmeisterr every time i remember that fact i get sad inside
[3:32:54] <Saltmeisterr> @justianxix bruh how do you make that mistake lol
[3:32:55] <%BoxNavy> massivehero samurai
[3:32:57] <K_ross> So it wasn’t just me that thought Kafka was ass
[3:33:00] <ballpoint_ren> psaCanada
[3:33:01] <%Plesin> and it only gets worse each time
[3:33:16] <artoflec> the FIRST boss was better than final bosses in 80% of games
[3:33:25] <penitentpendant> The most magical of pixels
[3:33:25] <dinnydanny777> I like how Bayonetta says boom
[3:33:32] <Saltmeisterr> @Plesin i honestly don't blame sakurai but yeah it sucks
[3:33:34] <T_Sasquatch> @diondrawsx5 it's hard to get into

[3:34:26] <+Goblinz_3> Yeah that's right you equip that bow LUL
[3:34:36] <%AncelDeLambert> even if it's "optimal" for this fight, GOD it feels like you're plunking away with BBs to use Kafka
[3:34:36] <%BoxNavy> yes
[3:34:37] <%baka_sugoi> trash bow save day
[3:34:37] <%Mahbonk> yup
[3:34:41] <fuji_92> yes
[3:34:44] <%AncelDeLambert> @PatStaresAt yep, Poison. Pointless, huh?
[3:34:51] <%FacetiousAF> all i can think of is "poisonpoisonpoisonpoisin" from kotor 2
[3:35:21] <dinnydanny777> Huh this kind of is even more like Kid Icarus now I guess
[3:35:21] <Valentinius_Anodyne> Kafka would probably feel a lot better to use if there was another long-range weapon to pair with it
[3:35:28] <%AncelDeLambert> holy crap, the poison is doing NOTHING
[3:35:34] <%TimetodiveLTX> was that from kotor 2 or was it a reference to something else?
[3:35:44] <%AncelDeLambert> Kafka would feel better if it actually had COMBOS
[3:35:55] <%Tyrimat> wow the bow does wonders here
[3:35:56] <%TimetodiveLTX> "from"*

[3:37:43] <%MidnightBurst12> that's hilarious
[3:37:46] <penitentpendant> A way I think they can 'solve' the 'what hair does she have?' issue is make each style of weapon have a different hair style tied to it. Or just give her several and let you choose a la costume switch.
[3:37:50] <dan_g_v> rules of nature!!

[3:38:52] <%AncelDeLambert> D'ya think we haven't heard anything about Bayo 3 because the devs just have NO clue what the plot should be?
[3:38:55] <ExpressNode> Why are the demons so much more powerful than angels?
[3:38:59] <penitentpendant> Not Stone!
[3:39:00] <pancake_madness> @K_ross which Dragon Age?!
[3:39:00] <+MayorRev> are you asking for horse realism in a game with a horny witch with clothes made of her hair

[3:46:02] <+MayorRev> Shield bastards are bstards
[3:46:03] <Mangahero18> Reminder that Bayonetta can only manipulate gravity when the moon is out...for...some reason.
[3:46:06] <%Plesin> Takemikazuchi is so powerful but yeah ross is right
[3:46:11] <%Plesin> It's the slowest fucking shit
[3:46:13] <%AncelDeLambert> @K_ross that's why you use jumping charge attacks. The losers can't touch you half the time and then you END them

[3:54:40] <Blank9> you do in multiplayer
[3:54:41] <%A_CD_By_Thomas> You do in the side stuff
[3:54:44] <BleedinActionMan> He's in Tag Climax
[3:54:46] <%Plesin> @PatStaresAt you CAN actually... only in tag climax though
[3:54:46] <+SinisterBroccoli> agree
[3:54:50] <marvel877> Only in multiplayer
[3:54:50] <Valentinius_Anodyne> You can, but only in Tag Climax mode
[3:54:50] <CanadianAnimatorGuy> You do play as Loki. Kappa
[3:54:51] <%Plesin> Same with rodin
[3:54:51] <%Fooguwu> this kid sucks
[3:54:52] <$spardanwarrior> That's why co-op mode exists
[3:54:59] <Hanyusha> I get such HOT FOR DAYS vibes
[3:55:05] <marvel877> ARA ARA

[3:55:23] <moonmintparadise> Yami Yugi is loosing
[3:55:24] <%ssjklyco> Featherweight
[3:55:27] <%Aydarkzero> i can't get over how this kid just has the millennium puzzle
[3:55:29] <%Piemono> He has to wear the mask because he is too hot
[3:55:30] <+justianxix> yugioh cards
[3:55:32] <Daxalog> Would you want cards or feathers? I think feathers would be harder to explain.
[3:55:32] <%baka_sugoi> my yugi ons
[3:55:34] <Laecerelius> Feathers beat Yu-Gi-Oh cards
[3:55:36] <%SaiyanShoto> And then Loki died the end
[3:55:48] <leinadtonu> but are they heavier than lead
[3:55:50] <NitronStreams> So a kilogram of feathers is heavier than a kilogram of cards?
[3:55:58] <DrkJP520> What weighs the most, a ton of feathers or a ton of cards?
[3:56:02] <%Aydarkzero> why doesn't he just summon the God Cards Kappa
[3:56:04] <dinnydanny777> Why does Loki have Chain of Memories cards
[3:56:09] <%A_CD_By_Thomas> Ye
[3:56:10] <Laecerelius> Yeah!

[3:57:10] <%A_CD_By_Thomas> I love how the implication of that verse is that they attacked you for ruining the couple's date LUL
[3:57:16] <NitronStreams> althoug to be fair who goes on a date when half the fucking city is on fire
[3:57:30] <Blank9> the angels are friends with cupid

[3:59:01] <%AncelDeLambert> chukka chukka chukka
[3:59:03] <%A_CD_By_Thomas> Honestly, not as cool as Durga in design
[3:59:07] <Daxalog> Wait. Why is he tired and covered in blood if the demon surrendered.
[3:59:10] <%Agami23> thats very similar to a thing in naruto
[3:59:15] <%AncelDeLambert> TEQUILA!
[3:59:23] <huskarl_zap> Solid froth
[3:59:24] <%arcielardor> the wind is howling
[3:59:32] <Valentinius_Anodyne> Undine is fun, though I preferred Durga
[3:59:37] <%AncelDeLambert> the serpents are so cool
[3:59:41] <%A_CD_By_Thomas> @Daxalog Probably still put up a helluva fight to get to that point
[3:59:45] <%BoxNavy> i forgot all about these

[4:01:22] <%weissguard> Bayo "The Hypocrite" Netta
[4:01:23] <marvel877> I can not stab the chi-uld.
[4:01:26] <%Xevtes> i hate him
[4:01:31] <CanadianAnimatorGuy> god I hate Loki so much
[4:01:35] <%augusta_wind> such a shitkid
[4:01:36] <+featherlan> This is how you 1-up Jeanne from Bayo 1
[4:01:37] <%SaiyanShoto> stop calling her love you child
[4:01:39] <Mangahero18> Look at this Gangsta Yugi
[4:01:48] <@commanderclaw> Does Bayo *have* a type?
[4:01:52] <%AncelDeLambert> the Sages just go at the speed of light
[4:01:55] <dinnydanny777> It's just like Dr Who :O
[4:01:56] <Daxalog> Wait. Space and Time. Is this just Blinx the Time sweeper.
[4:01:57] <+featherlan> I think they're both time
[4:01:58] <@SoFarFetched> TOKI WO TOMARE
[4:02:01] <%Plesin> @commanderclaw jeanne
[4:02:01] <+twohitgood> but...space is time.
[4:02:02] <%FacetiousAF> @commanderclaw jeanne
[4:02:03] <%augusta_wind> 'get this weak shit out of here'
[4:02:03] <dan_g_v> Bayo's type is white haired women
[4:02:03] <%LaughingCatt> Bayo's type is Jeanne
[4:02:05] <%AncelDeLambert> Sages don't slow down time, they speed themselves up
[4:02:05] <+featherlan> Just one slow time, and the other fast time
[4:02:05] <%baka_sugoi> ZA WORLDO
[4:02:06] <NitronStreams> He did the bullet thing!
[4:02:07] <Valentinius_Anodyne> I like Loki, but to be fair I'm a big fan of the awful gremlin types
[4:02:08] <Idon__> YEYEYE RIVAL BATTLE
[4:02:08] <%tank7013> I dunno that sure looked like time
[4:02:08] <+itsgundamu> YEYEYEYE
[4:02:09] <Zombrocom> Bayo is Bayo's type
[4:02:10] <%weissguard> @commanderclaw Probably Jeanne, LUL
[4:02:13] <%ssjklyco> Masked Lumen: Masked Lumen
[4:02:15] <%torusendor> @commanderclaw Style Beast
[4:02:15] <%AncelDeLambert> it's the same thing in effect, but it's A difference
[4:02:16] <Hanyusha> would be cooler if instead of time stop he would just pull a Tobi on you
[4:02:18] <%averyoddjew> been a while since she's seen one
[4:02:22] <%GarbageNirvana> Pokemon Lumen and Pokemon Umbral
[4:02:23] <stirlingw17> Za Warudo vs king Crimson
[4:02:24] <%SaiyanShoto> Her type is Luka Kappa
[4:02:26] <@commanderclaw> She has good taste then
[4:02:29] <BleedinActionMan> @PatStaresAt Maybe as in 'actually a sage and not someone dressed as one'
[4:02:30] <DianaTheAscian> cool health bar
[4:02:45] <+medrzec71> you can play as Lumen in the 2 player mode. have to unlock him first
[4:02:47] <%baka_sugoi> Lumen Space Umbral Time
[4:02:48] <Idon__> oh hey peacock feathers... that's... familiar.
[4:02:52] <+abrupt_abe> Cool shit starting
[4:02:59] <fuji_92> pokemon battle time
[4:03:00] <%BoxNavy> YEYEYEYE
[4:03:00] <%FacetiousAF> doggie
[4:03:01] <Clundy> The ui in this game is fabulous tbh
[4:03:02] <NitronStreams> KAIJU BATTLE GO!
[4:03:03] <Psyramics> you wanna summon adds? lets summon adds
[4:03:03] <dinnydanny777> Okay this is cool
[4:03:03] <+featherlan> I wish the music from the first phase of the boos stayed for the whole fight
[4:03:04] <Saltmeisterr> YEYEYE
[4:03:06] <%GarbageNirvana> YEYEYE
[4:03:07] <%Kduff89> POKEMON BATTLES
[4:03:07] <%Deano8817> KAIJU FIIIGHT
[4:03:08] <DianaTheAscian> cool
[4:03:08] <verscoll> Y O
[4:03:08] <%AncelDeLambert> I do like how Sages use Angelic feathers instead of hair
[4:03:11] <Clundy> Design wise anyways
[4:03:12] <+PkSilent01> YEYEYEYEYE
[4:03:12] <Valentinius_Anodyne> Yeyeye Kaiju fight
[4:03:13] <%Sol_Install> Lumen sages are pretty much have Satoru Gojo space ability but not insane
[4:03:14] <Mangahero18> So Lumen Sages draw on the power of Angels right? So they must have all been complete jobbers cause all the Angels we fight are total fucking pushovers.
[4:03:15] <%A_CD_By_Thomas> FUCK YEAH BAYBEEEEEE
[4:03:16] <+mgskomododragon> And then the entire area becomes a Lavascape
[4:03:16] <+justianxix> damn Summoners
[4:03:17] <+featherlan> The Lumen Sage theme is so boss
[4:03:18] <%Kduff89> this is cool ass shit omg
[4:03:18] <arkv01> GWAFFIX D:
[4:03:19] <BerryliciousDefinition> Thats rad
[4:03:20] <%wibbwobbler> DBstyle
[4:03:24] <%GarbageNirvana> FUCK EM UP
[4:03:31] <%dapperdoop> it even syncs up to how you're doing
[4:03:45] <%ssjklyco> I forgot that the fight in the back corresponds to how well you do
[4:03:46] <%A_CD_By_Thomas> Damn
[4:03:48] <Saltmeisterr> THE SHADOW
[4:03:48] <%Kduff89> just like kamyia to give you what looks like the final boss fight in the game literally like 2 hours in
[4:03:49] <%SaiyanShoto> I fucked this fight up the first time because I was staring at the damn kaiju battle happening in the back
[4:03:52] <%baka_sugoi> ded
[4:03:53] <%averyoddjew> F
[4:03:54] <%AncelDeLambert> Pat feelin the burn
[4:03:56] <CanadianAnimatorGuy> How do you avoid that giant lava blast?
[4:03:56] <fuji_92> THE SHADOW REMAINS CAST
[4:03:57] <Valentinius_Anodyne> The shadow remains cast
[4:03:58] <%A_CD_By_Thomas> Is Gief Jojo-posin'?
[4:04:01] <xanerts> man one thing bayo has over dmc is that it has way more spectacle
[4:04:10] <Cai_Behr> Apparently there's no penalties for using items in this game, so go ham
[4:04:17] <%AncelDeLambert> this fight makes it clear that the power of angels and demons corresponds to the power of whoever summons them
[4:04:23] <BleedinActionMan> @CanadianAnimatorGuy You have to attack him before he finishes channeling
[4:04:32] <CanadianAnimatorGuy> Gotcha
[4:04:34] <BleedinActionMan> Like that
[4:04:36] <%A_CD_By_Thomas> Fuckin' YES
[4:04:49] <%Kduff89> his stinger is so fuckin fast too
[4:04:50] <%BoxNavy> doggie
[4:04:53] <%BoxNavy> i saw that
[4:04:54] <Valentinius_Anodyne> @Cai_Behr There may not be penalties, yet nonetheless only cowards use items
[4:04:54] <%baka_sugoi> WOLF
[4:04:58] <i_am_therydon> a doge?
[4:05:15] <%FacetiousAF> psaDogchamp
[4:05:24] <%FacetiousAF> beeeeeg MAAAAMAAAAA
[4:05:25] <%A_CD_By_Thomas> HERE WE FUCKIN' GOOO
[4:05:27] <huskarl_zap> he shrieks like a fox too
[4:05:29] <Cai_Behr> MADAMA BUTTERFLY IS SO RAW
[4:05:29] <%SirGO0SE> beeg wooman
[4:05:34] <%baka_sugoi> STAND BATTLES
[4:05:34] <BerryliciousDefinition> COOL
[4:05:38] <%AncelDeLambert> their summons are assembly line shit
[4:05:39] <Idon__> They don't have to do a sexy dance is the major bonus
[4:05:40] <%Broand> Is this some sort pokemon battle
[4:05:41] <%ssjklyco> this is just a pokemon battle, but the trainers also fight
[4:05:45] <%Aydarkzero> weird
[4:05:47] <T_Sasquatch> Wtf is happening on screen
[4:05:49] <%Kduff89> no dance just feathers
[4:05:51] <+Greywyn00> Lumens are pretty fucking cool in comparison to Bayo 1
[4:05:52] <%averyoddjew> and they don't have to make pacts as strict
[4:05:53] <%A_CD_By_Thomas> SourPls
[4:06:00] <+featherlan> @T_Sasquatch Greatness
[4:06:01] <%AncelDeLambert> of course, [REDACTED] could just not have the best stuff to work with, here
[4:06:03] <pilllowofbees> they also probably wont turn against you
[4:06:10] <Zebroneath> I find it luaghable that this isn't the final boss fight.
[4:06:15] <%Aydarkzero> looks like a Regi
[4:06:17] <%komradedog> komradedog subscribed at Tier 1. They've subscribed for 32 months! i've been here for a very long time, huh? hoping Bayo gets her long hair back
[4:06:17] <DrkJP520> We sure this isn't the final boss fight? I'm mean, just look
[4:06:32] <Profmcstevie> We did make a living deleting angels, so he probably has fuck all to summon to his side LUL
[4:06:33] <%Kduff89> whats the up and down with madam doing an ora ora here
[4:06:41] <%BoxNavy> and iirc the final boss isnt anywhere near this cool
[4:06:46] <DianaTheAscian> man bayos dad sucked compared to this guy
[4:06:47] <+Greywyn00> Demons are naturally more individual so it makes sense they'd be in general tougher but more difficult
[4:06:48] <+rbakervv> @DrkJP520 this is just the 1st rival fight, the FIRST
[4:06:50] <Mangahero18> Damn this fight looks tough.
[4:06:56] <+BlackJack607> How is this not the final battle but it's already so epic?
[4:07:03] <%AncelDeLambert> the only thing this game is missing is music on the level of Revengeance
[4:07:06] <%Kduff89> dont choke now pat
[4:07:06] <+battlebeast67> Holy shit I hated this fight on Infinite Climax
[4:07:15] <%AncelDeLambert> there's no INCREDIBLE vocals that kick in
[4:07:17] <%Kduff89> oh fuck hes choking
[4:07:17] <Valentinius_Anodyne> @BlackJack607 That's how this series rolls
[4:07:18] <@SoFarFetched> saved by cutscene
[4:07:19] <Cai_Behr> I always found not having a visible floor in this fight to be really off putting to play through
[4:07:20] <%A_CD_By_Thomas> HERE WE GO
[4:07:20] <%baka_sugoi> CLUTCH
[4:07:23] <%Aydarkzero> saved by scripted LUL
[4:07:24] <%AncelDeLambert> oh look, Woolie bait
[4:07:26] <%BoxNavy> play punch out motherfucker
[4:07:26] <%Kduff89> nvm psaDogchamp
