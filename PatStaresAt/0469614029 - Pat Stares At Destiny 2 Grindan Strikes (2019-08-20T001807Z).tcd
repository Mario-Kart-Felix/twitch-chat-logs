[0:00:00] <FennecZephyr> I mean, we could get the entire clan banned
[0:00:02] <Treuan> Report the clan, don't dox the clan
[0:00:03] <dredshift> Why can't you report a clan itself?
[0:00:06] <+alphonseisbest> LUL
[0:00:06] <millamoks> but can't you llok up players in a clan by the clan noame on the bungie website?
[0:00:06] <DeniedPants> I missed it, what happened
[0:00:07] <%Iccirrus> @MasterDecoder he deleted the clan
[0:00:07] <+Crimsonpajamas > You can use the bungie website instead of the app
[0:00:09] <%Kirby_Sauce> Induce lag into the stream. Fake him out into resending it
[0:00:10] <%cureneckbeard> ban clan
[0:00:11] <TheIndigoLlama> Mods on that Golden Gun aim today PogChamp
[0:00:11] <%spookycool> this one is good
[0:00:12] <%DedlokPM> PEOPLE! SPELL DOT AS DAWT ie bungie dawt net
[0:00:18] <+bonzosan> battlenet shows the players you recently played with.
[0:00:19] <%QueequegTheater> @AngriestPat If it makes you feel better it's my birthday. This year, I got a totaled car :)
[0:00:22] <krymzen5> not really doxing tho
[0:00:27] <+metalsiren31> Glad I tuned in at an opportune time
[0:00:28] <shinigami40297> @AngriestPat its a setting under account privacy on the bungie website
[0:00:28] <HibikiYamada> or, you know, just say Bungie's website lmfao
[0:00:31] <Asuxley> dawt
[0:00:37] <%Kirby_Sauce> This is a great strike
[0:00:38] <%ThatOneGameTester> bungie daught net?
[0:00:40] <shadowsofpain> that works
[0:00:48] <+Ryan1016> No clue
[0:00:54] <%StripesUltimateEdition> galaxy brain bungie
[0:00:54] <+Pyroclase> At least the LORE isn't in the game anymore
[0:00:55] <shadowsofpain> Blame Activision
[0:00:55] <SomersaultJustice> bunjo
[0:00:55] <%ArcanumMBD> WELCOME TO DESTINY
[0:00:55] <%Ranryu692> because Bungie is fucking stupid
[0:00:55] <OnyxMemory> Clans are managed and joined on the website idk
[0:00:58] <Veteranhelldiver17> i don't know
[0:00:59] <+Pyroclase> EOr, on the website even
[0:01:00] <%DedlokPM> @AngriestPat Same reason that the Codex is on the website
[0:01:03] <King_Wolf_Rigger> @QueequegTheater How did you get a totaled car? Someone give it to you, or did they hit your car?
[0:01:05] <kindashagg> That's a hop skip and a shit from their GAME
[0:01:06] <Veteranhelldiver17> i blame activision
[0:01:06] <%ssjklyco> I imagine that is an Activision decision and will go away after october
[0:01:07] <%Nobrev> activision probably
[0:01:07] <RamenRiderZ> We should tell Bungie
[0:01:07] <%Kirby_Sauce> The app os good though
[0:01:11] <wookie5358> Because user interaction
[0:01:11] <+Brewstamasta> Just remember D1 lore tabs...
[0:01:12] <derekwst3> they want you to visit all of them
[0:01:13] <MartiusGW> its so bungie
[0:01:15] <%Engwithan_Elder_God> Good Lord. What the Hell are they doing at Bungie?
[0:01:16] <shinigami40297> because the clan system is based of the bungie profile and everything else is just tied back into that
[0:01:16] <MasterDecoder> @DedlokPM Not anymore
[0:01:20] <%spookycool> trust owns
[0:01:20] <+Grayhammatter> das a good cannon
[0:01:20] <Zombrocom> So what happened though
[0:01:23] <%TheBlankAce> Remnants of activision probably
[0:01:25] <%ThatOneGameTester> because cross promotion means more areas they can sell ad space Pat you know this in your heart
[0:01:26] <coldsama> wait I missed something?
[0:01:27] <mr_red117> NotLikeThis just like the grimoire NotLikeThis
[0:01:29] <%Kirby_Sauce> @Brewstamasta hey, those were hood
[0:01:29] <$Kenzo2000> E N G A G E M E N T
[0:01:30] <%Iccirrus> On one hand,it allows for cross platform clans
[0:01:30] <Zebroneath> Talk about inconvinient
[0:01:32] <%Iccirrus> on the other, fuckery
[0:01:40] <%spookycool> spookycool subscribed with Twitch Prime.
[0:01:44] <Zombrocom> thats fucked
[0:01:47] <Veteranhelldiver17> @Brewstamasta oh yeah the grimorie, i had that memory blocked from my mind
[0:01:52] <%QueequegTheater> @King_Wolf_Rigger Car died in an intersection, nobody got out to help me and instead they all just drove around me
[0:01:53] <Zombrocom> thats super fucked
[0:01:54] <%Puhff> :O
[0:01:58] <%Puhff> FUCKING WOW
[0:02:00] <shadowsofpain> again Pat you have the same roll as me but with a better masterwork aka I got Makoto, you got Sae Nijima
[0:02:08] <Joey_JoestarXD> i really like the environments in this game
[0:02:18] <Joey_JoestarXD> maybe its just the lighting but its neat
[0:02:18] <shinigami40297> its a remnant of Destiny 1 when clans where not in game because ps4 and xbox1 did not support that feature at the time so the system was based on the website
[0:02:28] <SerenityVerse> wait until you actually have ace of spades. thing is insane even after the nerfs
[0:02:37] <kindashagg> Still are. Just a bump.
[0:02:39] <LorcaNomad> how did pat get the gun he's using?
[0:02:43] <%Gray_skies1993> @Joey_JoestarXD agreed! the environments are very interesting
[0:02:49] <%Iccirrus> bounty drop @LorcaNomad
[0:02:50] <RamenRiderZ> Only companion app for Destiny 2 I would recommend is Ishtar Commander
[0:02:50] <King_Wolf_Rigger> @QueequegTheater fucking bummer. My truck got totaled when someone blew through a red light doing 40 mph and t-boned me.
[0:02:50] <%Kirby_Sauce> @shadowsofpain haha. That's great.
[0:02:53] <%Iccirrus> or rank up
[0:02:53] <%QueequegTheater> Why did they bring back AoS but not Tlaloc
[0:02:56] <KnightAsteran> @lorcanomad gambit bounty reward
[0:02:57] <Tucker0603> @lorcanomad Gambit
[0:02:57] <%Iccirrus> they happened at the same time
[0:02:58] <Veteranhelldiver17> @Puhff said clan name also contained the N-word so take that as an indicator of what kind of person he was dealing with
[0:03:02] <%dekkitout> Ace got nerfed? Man that gun's a trooper...
[0:03:03] <%spookycool> @LorcaNomad gambit
[0:03:04] <shadowsofpain> @lorcanomad he got them from a gambit bounty
[0:03:07] <+Pyroclase> that's an autoshotgun, pat!
[0:03:10] <%Sovspot> pat got stream sniped by a griefer?
[0:03:14] <ScreamLord> @LorcaNomad Gambit Big Banker Bounty and a Rank Up package
[0:03:18] <+Grayhammatter> jesus, he got fucked
[0:03:20] <%Kirby_Sauce> Remember phogoth?
[0:03:20] <Veteranhelldiver17> @Sovspot seems like it
[0:03:20] <Wan6Saber> @Sovspot no, a ghoster
[0:03:26] <Arweynn> Gambit reward, you also get it from 1 reset of gambit rank
[0:03:27] <%QueequegTheater> @Sovspot basically
[0:03:29] <%goose_attack_almanac> Oh I remember this one!
[0:03:32] <MasterDecoder> @Zombrocom You know, the usual shitty, childish, racist stuff trash spew on the Internet.
[0:03:45] <SomersaultJustice> buh nuh na nuh NUH!
[0:03:45] <%Boscuito> PRIME ENGRAM
[0:03:51] <shadowsofpain> @kirby_sauce He showed up in the new trailer
[0:03:53] <%Aeoneth> does anyone have a clip or pic of that clan name? If so please PM it to me so I can search and report it
[0:03:55] <RamenRiderZ> Ace got a slight nerf, you dont keep the Memento bullets when you switch
[0:03:57] <%StripesUltimateEdition> ENGWAM OWO
[0:04:01] <kylejefferies> Does anyone know if my donation popped up? PayPal was fine but then streamlabs crashed after.

[0:04:26] <%Boscuito> am the idiot
[0:04:29] <%Piemen99> ??????
[0:04:30] <TangoNango> Any loot you didn't pick up will just go to postmaster

[0:04:38] <kylejefferies> one guy
[0:04:39] <%dekkitout> Yall sure it wasn't a legendary drop?
[0:04:39] <Veteranhelldiver17> lol
[0:04:40] <IndoorSitup> It's over there.
[0:04:40] <ScreamLord> What happens to these Guardians is actually legitimately terrifying tho. They're light is sucked out and they're turned into crystals
[0:04:40] <shadowsofpain> no worries it'll be at the postmaster if it exist
[0:04:41] <%king_wragles> ONE GUY OP, pls nerf
[0:04:43] <OnyxMemory> Has pat tried to get outbreak yet, i dont remember what light thats at
[0:04:43] <%Boscuito> why was it the only time i was wrong
[0:04:43] <%QueequegTheater> @King_Wolf_Rigger yikes
[0:04:46] <%SergeEXE> SergeEXE subscribed at Tier 1. They've subscribed for 20 months! have you heard Data and Picard by Pogo? Great song, you'd love it
[0:04:49] <+Grayhammatter> it'll be in the postmaster if it was even there
[0:04:51] <kylejefferies> One Guy needs to be an emote
[0:05:00] <%ThatOneGameTester> uhn uhn uhn where is it? - duke nukem & also Pat now
[0:05:25] <%QueequegTheater> They've been breeding Eris Morn havent they
[0:05:37] <%dekkitout> This- is this the Krusty Krab?
[0:05:43] <OnyxMemory> god this strike has the worst voice acting
[0:05:45] <%demegodz> Found the mother fucker and reported him
[0:05:47] <%spookycool> god tier dialogue
[0:05:48] <Veteranhelldiver17> remember when the ghost had dumb dialouge after completing a patrol mission
[0:05:50] <Tucker0603> poor taeko-3
[0:05:58] <%Gray_skies1993> good on ya mate @demegodz
[0:05:59] <%arcaderabbit48> Wait, so it is just explicitly magic?
[0:06:04] <Tucker0603> @demegodz nice
[0:06:08] <%pilgrimsayswhat> Space magic
[0:06:09] <shadowsofpain> @queequegtheater More like Eris Moans... I'm sorry
[0:06:17] <+Pyroclase> @Veteranhelldiver17 Oh wow, I didn't even realize they removed it until you reminded me just now
[0:06:19] <%Aeoneth> @demegodz Well done
[0:06:24] <%QueequegTheater> @shadowsofpain I'm not. Corruption is sexy
[0:06:25] <SirTeabottom> God bless you demegodz
[0:06:27] <Veteranhelldiver17> @shadowsofpain ........... go sit in a corner
[0:06:30] <King_Wolf_Rigger> @QueequegTheater yeah lol. The guy's mini cooper was trashed. his engine tucked under his car. He was fine though, thankfully.
[0:06:32] <KnightAsteran> @arcaderabbit48 Hive use magic fueled by a system known as Sword Logic, it's pretty cool
[0:06:33] <+earthboy2k> Warlock? Ewwww
[0:06:43] <%Zamorouskiwhich> I think there are like 3 more?
[0:06:44] <%Maids4lyfe> what quest?
[0:06:45] <%dekkitout> Crucible step
[0:06:45] <shinigami40297> theres 3 more
[0:06:46] <%StripesUltimateEdition> WARLOCK GANG
[0:06:47] <Tucker0603> there's more
[0:06:50] <%king_wragles> @AngriestPat I remember more
[0:06:59] <%Segartner> @earthboy2k shut up, warlock is the master class
[0:06:59] <%Aeoneth> there's a couple more
[0:07:00] <shadowsofpain> @veteranhelldiver17 I'll put that under consideration
[0:07:01] <%Aeoneth> yes
[0:07:03] <KnightAsteran> Ace is pretty long
[0:07:07] <%Aeoneth> 25 precision kills in crucible
[0:07:09] <RamenRiderZ> There's an easy mission
[0:07:09] <+alpacasintophats> 3 more if memory serves
[0:07:11] <Veteranhelldiver17> @Pyroclase i remember the most useless garba, but not the stuff i need, go my brain
[0:07:16] <%spookycool> did he finish solstice
[0:07:20] <%Aeoneth> Open caches on Tangled Shore, EDZ, IO and NEssus
[0:07:21] <+bonzosan> no
[0:07:24] <%QueequegTheater> Are any of these exotic quests as crazy as the Sleeper Simulant back in D1?
[0:07:27] <%gespenst25> that WIZARD came FROM THE MooN
[0:07:27] <%Aeoneth> then complete the Ace in the Hole mission
[0:07:28] <+Pyroclase> You need to do a mission too
[0:07:28] <King_Wolf_Rigger> Is it people, tho?
[0:07:30] <shadowsofpain> the precision kills step will be easier with the Trust
[0:07:39] <shinigami40297> crucible kills, cayde caches, and a mission thats pretty neat
[0:07:42] <KnightAsteran> @queequegtheater acrius is pretty up there iirc
[0:07:49] <kylejefferies> damn it streamlabs
[0:07:50] <%king_wragles> Wait, is he talking about the current mission or the gun objectives?
[0:07:54] <Veteranhelldiver17> @QueequegTheater Outbreak prime had solve a ACSII puzzle
[0:07:54] <startstoprepeat> it's gonna be great when you unlock ace, fire it and go "actually, i like my trust more"
[0:07:57] <OnyxMemory> sleeper wasnt as crazy as the outbreak prime quest in d1
[0:08:05] <OnyxMemory> that required the entire community and yes an ascii puzle
[0:08:09] <%bevyrage> dunk the ball
[0:08:09] <%totesmcgoat_> Ace in the Hole is such a good mission. A perfect send off.
[0:08:10] <+Grayhammatter> pass pat the rock
[0:08:11] <%dekkitout> I wanna say Polaris Lance with Catalyst is on par with Sleeper when Lance first came out in terms of annoying quest
[0:08:13] <shadowsofpain> @startstoprepeat that's what happened with me
[0:08:23] <startstoprepeat> ha
[0:08:25] <%Aeoneth> @OnyxMemory Good times thems was
[0:08:26] <King_Wolf_Rigger> Time to play some good ol' 'Murican football
[0:08:27] <kylejefferies> I'm trying to donate and after PayPal screens Streamlabs is just a blank white page of nothing.
[0:08:27] <%QueequegTheater> @AngriestPat The quest for Sleeper Simulant in D1 involved brute force hacking a puzzle with three other people
[0:08:33] <Veteranhelldiver17> Taken king was my jam
[0:08:35] <KnightAsteran> also one of the forges had a puzzle to unlock it that the devs eventually just turned off cuase nobody could solve it @queequegtheater
[0:08:36] <%QueequegTheater> *two
[0:08:39] <RamenRiderZ> music glitched? No Hive rave
[0:08:43] <%logoth_> hit them with your balls
[0:08:44] <%spookycool> chaos dunk
[0:08:44] <%QueequegTheater> @KnightAsteran wow
[0:08:48] <+Grayhammatter> monkaS
[0:08:49] <ScreamLord> @AngriestPat There is a similar Gambit HG called Spre Rations that is also really good. It's kinetic
[0:08:52] <%StripesUltimateEdition> sacrifice
[0:08:57] <%bevyrage> GAAAOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOL
[0:09:05] <%QueequegTheater> @KnightAsteran Did they ever say the solution?
[0:09:06] <ScreamLord> *Spare Rations
[0:09:09] <King_Wolf_Rigger> That's a touchdown folks! 6 points for Pat
[0:09:14] <OnyxMemory> majors
[0:09:15] <startstoprepeat> yellow bars
[0:09:15] <+Pyroclase> Use it for elite enemies
[0:09:16] <%StripesUltimateEdition> is that a fuckin TAZ reference
[0:09:17] <%Iccirrus> use them on yellow bars
[0:09:17] <OnyxMemory> yellow bars
[0:09:18] <+SubSamwich> yellow yealth enemies
[0:09:18] <%Iccirrus> big bois
[0:09:19] <shadowsofpain> @screamlord But that one is only in Prime and in Reckoning
[0:09:20] <Veteranhelldiver17> @bevyrage more like touchdown!
[0:09:20] <%QueequegTheater> Yellow
[0:09:22] <%totesmcgoat_> Ultras and Bosses
[0:09:23] <%TubeMan642> always
[0:09:24] <+Theworld732> shielded enemies
[0:09:26] <Tucker0603> yellow bars
[0:09:28] <%king_wragles> @AngriestPat on big stuff or when you wanna look really cool
[0:09:29] <%Aeoneth> General rule of thumb is: Red bars, Primary, Yellows, Special, Bosses Heavy
[0:09:30] <KnightAsteran> @queequegtheater i think datto figured it out like 4 days later, this was like two weeks of puzzle solving
[0:09:30] <%Boscuito> yellow bars and shields is my go to
[0:09:33] <%bevyrage> it's a sportball, doesn't matter what you call it
[0:09:34] <%dekkitout> When would you use a sniper? For example
[0:09:38] <%Zamorouskiwhich> Shielded enemies, or when you need a burst of damage, like shotgun or fusion
[0:09:39] <%totesmcgoat_> Things that need to die quicker
[0:09:39] <%Kirby_Sauce> Special is for dealing with chonks
[0:09:42] <Veteranhelldiver17> OH crooked fang
[0:09:44] <@thenefftw> I use special whenever I feel like it because fuck it
[0:09:44] <%demegodz> Lol the idiot put his Twitch channel on the clan page, so reported that too
[0:09:45] <%QueequegTheater> @KnightAsteran OFC it was Datto LUL
[0:09:49] <startstoprepeat> opening shot's pretty nice on crooked fang
[0:09:53] <%Segartner> i hate the dialoge in this fucking strike
[0:09:54] <%Segartner> fuck
[0:09:57] <startstoprepeat> good for invasions
[0:09:57] <KaliasTV> Dragonfly not so great
[0:10:00] <%Kirby_Sauce> Power is for when you need to clear a room
[0:10:02] <Veteranhelldiver17> @demegodz the Spammer?
[0:10:04] <+Pyroclase> dragonfly isn't great on linear fusions
[0:10:07] <%GarbageNirvana> It's not that well-acted
[0:10:07] <%demegodz> @Veteranhelldiver17 Yeah
[0:10:10] <%dekkitout> Could be better
[0:10:10] <+jwimz> It’s okay
[0:10:15] <%bevyrage> yeah these dialogue exchanges are too similar to D1's
[0:10:15] <shadowsofpain> I'd rate it a 6.5/10
[0:10:21] <%spookycool> really bothers me when people in this game say "nope"
[0:10:23] <+bonzosan> how is dragonfly on bows?
[0:10:24] <SerenityVerse> depending on your amm drop perks you could run a special weapon as your main weapon and never be short on ammo
[0:10:24] <RamenRiderZ> Linears are good for Gambit invaders
[0:10:25] <%Aeoneth> @bevyrage they are D1s
[0:10:25] <shadowsofpain> better than average
[0:10:25] <%JoeJotaro> her voice acting is trash lol
[0:10:26] <+informedotaku> waste specials first so you can pick up ammo for it along the way as you use primary. primary ammo recover fast as special do not.
[0:10:29] <Veteranhelldiver17> @demegodz OH, MY, God the stupidity it burns
[0:10:30] <%Shadowthedigger> Shadowthedigger subscribed with Twitch Prime. They've subscribed for 13 months!
[0:10:35] <+Pyroclase> no
[0:10:37] <King_Wolf_Rigger> Yeah, dialogue feels a bit stilted and weird. Why did you change your mind so quickly?
[0:10:40] <%bevyrage> @Aeoneth before or after they wrote out dinklage though
[0:10:44] <Tucker0603> @demegodz lol
[0:10:44] <%Iccirrus> that's just unlocking the forges on 3 characters
[0:10:44] <+Pyroclase> you just need to unlock it seperately on each alt
[0:10:45] <+jamiam1027> @AngriestPat what raids have you done so far?
[0:10:46] <%spookycool> that's just the forge unlocks
[0:10:46] <%Piemen99> no no no no no
[0:10:46] <shadowsofpain> kind of yeah
[0:10:47] <+SubSamwich> yep, black armory implementation is pretty bad
[0:10:49] <%dekkitout> Yep- it's dumb, we know
[0:10:50] <%Iccirrus> you can do it all on just one
[0:10:51] <startstoprepeat> i think unlocking the forges is character based, yeah. sucks.
[0:10:52] <%Segartner> that's what i'm saying
[0:10:53] <%Aeoneth> YOu have to unlock the forges on all 3 characters if you want to do them with any character
[0:10:54] <%Segartner> it sucks
[0:10:54] <%Bailey__gaming> yay he forged the heavy machine gun
[0:10:58] <%Aeoneth> YEah it's a bit fucked
[0:10:58] <@thenefftw> BA's forges are a slog to go through
[0:11:00] <%dekkitout> Unlocking the forges isn't global
[0:11:00] <%Iccirrus> doing it on 3 just gives you more curated chances in a week
[0:11:01] <badhaye> just the one
[0:11:07] <+jwimz> Yeah it’s dumb. I only did it with one character
[0:11:08] <+Pyroclase> I swear to you the new raids are MUCH better
[0:11:08] <shadowsofpain> Black armory was a learning experience for Bungie
[0:11:09] <RamenRiderZ> The forge unlocks arent account wide
[0:11:10] <ScreamLord> @AngriestPat For the Thorn quest you have to do an extra special fucked up version of this Strike all the Thrall's can one shot you
[0:11:11] <%Piemen99> Just do it on one and transfer them to whatever charater
[0:11:12] <+Pyroclase> a lot fewer wipe mechanics
[0:11:12] <%StripesUltimateEdition> you really need a guide and dedicated voice chat for it
[0:11:13] <OnyxMemory> Last wish is worth doing
[0:11:15] <%StripesUltimateEdition> its a pain in the ass
[0:11:21] <+informedotaku> any raid or that raid in particular?
[0:11:25] <+jamiam1027> @AngriestPat aw dude you should totally try last wish
[0:11:26] <Veteranhelldiver17> @AngriestPat i think we found the spammer and we reported him FYI
[0:11:28] <+SubSamwich> you should try raiding with Teawrex some time
[0:11:30] <%Aeoneth> What made you hate Leviathan @AngriestPat
[0:11:32] <Tucker0603> last Wish is good one
[0:11:33] <@thenefftw> Scourge is still a great raid
[0:11:35] <%Segartner> please for the love of everything holy you need to do riven of a thousand voices, any time, just do it whenever you want.
[0:11:38] <$valriot> You need to unlock the forges with each character, but that's it otherwise. Its annoying but it's fine, plus Black Armoury has an Exotic bow that POG
[0:11:38] <thetruenicster> man, that Gamescom thing was baaaaaaad
[0:11:40] <%Ninestempest> Last Wish is fuckin' good
[0:11:40] <@thenefftw> I really like it
[0:11:42] <%Ninestempest> I promise
[0:11:43] <OnyxMemory> Leviathan was horrible
[0:11:46] <alexmemes> You can just do forges on the one character if you want
[0:11:50] <%dekkitout> I miss the last man standing clutch moments that D1 had
[0:11:52] <+aogman> @angriestpat let's get last wish my dude
[0:11:52] <shadowsofpain> @angriestpat are you giving up on Raids in general or just Leviathan
[0:11:52] <OnyxMemory> I raid savage in ff14 and I love last wish
[0:12:02] <OnyxMemory> its the best raid in destiny period
[0:12:03] <+Ryan1016> Leviathan is basically Mario party yeah
[0:12:03] <Veteranhelldiver17> @thenefftw the final boss is a pain to get in the right position
[0:12:05] <%StripesUltimateEdition> yeah destiny 2's raids are meant for a niche
[0:12:06] <%Ranryu692> sounds like the Destiny 1 raids
[0:12:06] <%Ninestempest> idk how you take 6 hours to do leviathan lmao
[0:12:08] <karamsky1> I personally think destiny raids are one of the best out there
[0:12:09] <%spookycool> baths were cool
[0:12:09] <shadowsofpain> because Leviathan is more or less hot garbage
[0:12:11] <%Iccirrus> levi is kinda bad
[0:12:13] <@thenefftw> Yeah, it can be a shit sometimes
[0:12:15] <startstoprepeat> you're gonna hate last wish in that case, but you'll probably like the other two new ones
[0:12:17] <+DrN0rd> i agree its not for everyone
[0:12:20] <%Kirby_Sauce> Relay was great
[0:12:20] <+sorcha> raids should only take you like 2 hours at most
[0:12:20] <%ArcanumMBD> were you going in blind every week?
[0:12:24] <+Pyroclase> Leviathan is bad but Last Wish and the other raids are wonderful
[0:12:25] <%arcaderabbit48> Why did you do it so much then?
[0:12:25] <alexmemes> Last Wish is great, I think Crown is a lot of fun. They’re a lot less arduous
[0:12:25] <%Iccirrus> Last wish,scourge,and crown are great though
[0:12:32] <%QueequegTheater> Destiny raids are basically high-gravity training compared to normal MMO raids
[0:12:35] <%GarbageNirvana> I've resolved I'm never gonna be raiding in Destiny 2 at all
[0:12:37] <%dekkitout> D1 raids was stand here and shoot, D2 wants you to decipher a codex
[0:12:40] <shinigami40297> Leviathan is not so great in retrospect, Last Wish and Scourge are much better as is the newest one
[0:12:40] <shadowsofpain> Last wish and Scorge are very fun though
[0:12:43] <@thenefftw> All the Year 2 raids are great
[0:12:48] <%Ninestempest> @dekkitout did you never play fucking king's fall lmao
[0:12:48] <ScreamLord> Last Wish, Scourge of the Past, and Crown of Sorrow are all pretty good tho. They don't have nearly as much fuckery to them
[0:12:49] <%ArcanumMBD> how does that take you 6 hours then O_O
[0:12:49] <$valriot> Leviathan was like Gordias. the other raids are pretty good, Last Wish is great
[0:12:56] <%dekkitout> I loved KF, actually
[0:12:56] <+jamiam1027> Leviathan is definitely pretty divisive but Last Wish is a lot more universally loved
[0:12:58] <RamenRiderZ> Last Wish has some communication
[0:13:08] <%GarbageNirvana> Can't ever get a group together and they still haven't figured out how to implement proper matchmaking for em so
[0:13:11] <%Aeoneth> D2Y2 raids ARE fun, but from what Pat is saying I don't think they'd be up his alley
[0:13:12] <%Bailey__gaming> bungie like to hide stuff behind bs suite like memorization and jumping puzzles
[0:13:12] <%dekkitout> And KF was stand here and shoot- while 1 person runs around
[0:13:14] <Veteranhelldiver17> @demegodz so how did you find the litltle racist that could?
[0:13:15] <kylejefferies> I remember doing raids in D1 with a full squad of nearly maxed gear and Ads would wipe us in like 2-3 hits.
[0:13:23] <%spookycool> a matchmade raid sounds awful lol
[0:13:25] <SGrim> @AngriestPat have you considered streaming your half of the podcast recording. I, personally, would love you answer questions I can hear for three hours. It's be very on-brand for the channel.
[0:13:27] <%QueequegTheater> @AngriestPat I played the D1 raids before ever touching an MMO raid so when I started FFXIV I was shocked by how forgiving they were LUL
[0:13:32] <shadowsofpain> ignore the D2Y1 Raids they more or less arent worth your time, the D2Y2 ones I think you would enjoy
[0:13:41] <ScreamLord> @AngriestPat Last Wish is good and the gear looks cool
[0:13:42] <King_Wolf_Rigger> That wasn't even static. You can clearly hear what he says lol
[0:13:52] <%Bailey__gaming> @angriestpat jumping puzzles are my Shadow puzzles, I can't do them
[0:13:54] <$valriot> Man, I fucking love Lance Hendrick
[0:13:56] <+aogman> @angriestpat warlock BESTlock
[0:14:00] <%QueequegTheater> Destiny raids are weighted training gear
[0:14:01] <%spookycool> reddick
[0:14:01] <SerenityVerse> 6 hours is ridiculous, with a good team you can beat OG Leviathan in 45 mins
[0:14:30] <+SubSamwich> arent you friends with teawrex? try raiding with him
[0:14:38] <%bevyrage> @SerenityVerse 45 minutes if nobody gets a bug or glitches out, and everyone is mildly competent
[0:14:41] <%Kirby_Sauce> It's not that long
[0:14:46] <+Pyroclase> Lsat Wish has a lot fewer "everyone dies" mechanicsw
[0:14:46] <+mrcooperblack> once you get up to 700 power, last wish is way easier to manage
[0:14:47] <%Iccirrus> raids don't take 6 hours anymore, they're MUCH shorter than that when people know what's up
[0:14:47] <fox_olive> why in gods name are raids taking your team so long
[0:14:50] <%Ranryu692> Destiny raids are bad
[0:14:50] <+Ryan1016> LW is not like that
[0:14:52] <+SubSamwich> any competent raider shouldn't take more than an hour and a half tops
[0:14:52] <Veteranhelldiver17> too punishing
[0:14:54] <%QueequegTheater> Leviathan is pretty bad
[0:14:55] <%bevyrage> it'll take more than twice as long if someone gets spawn locked
[0:15:00] <%Maids4lyfe> Last Wish isn't like that at all
[0:15:00] <$valriot> Sounds like you need better teammates
[0:15:01] <%Iccirrus> Last Wish is the longest and it takes less than an hour
[0:15:03] <startstoprepeat> now that a lot of bosses can be killed in a single rotation, it's way more forgiving
[0:15:04] <%Ninestempest> yeah that shit doesnt 'happen at ALL
[0:15:08] <OnyxMemory> do you still do savage in 14?
[0:15:16] <KnightAsteran> he doesnt
[0:15:18] <%dekkitout> Post Forsaken raids have moved away from that
[0:15:18] <%Iccirrus> Scourge and crown are both sub 45 runs easy
[0:15:20] <%ArcanumMBD> What I'm hearing is Pat saying "Mechanics are for cars"
[0:15:21] <+Pyroclase> Alsi they added banners to raids to restore all your ammo and super
[0:15:23] <+mrcooperblack> last wish raid is the most stable raid in teh game right now
[0:15:30] <%ssjklyco> Dabage
[0:15:33] <ScreamLord> @AngriestPat Last WIsh isn't nearly as fucky. It's a lot more shooty and a lot less puzzley
[0:15:34] <+ultimafullmetal> Destiny Raids are harder than FF14 ones for sure, though I've never done savage ones.
[0:15:36] <+Grayhammatter> do davage
[0:15:38] <%Bailey__gaming> Menagerie is fun
[0:15:42] <shadowsofpain> Did they fix the respawn bug I dont remember that happening last few times I raided
[0:15:51] <%Ninestempest> desitny raids take like an hour, you had a shit team probably man
[0:15:52] <RamenRiderZ> Destiny raids are communication heavy
[0:15:53] <EpslionBear> the respawn bug was fixed in warmind
[0:15:53] <%Segartner> you could do the raid with people that know what they are doing
[0:15:53] <%Aeoneth> I think Pat would have to watch a proper raid to see if the Y2 ones are even something he'd want to attempt
[0:15:54] <%QueequegTheater> @AngriestPat Would you say Destiny raids are like the Hyperbolic Time Chamber
[0:15:57] <alexmemes> You could join a Last Wish and stand there shooting ads and beat it in less than 2 hours. There are lots of people who would gladly take you through it!
[0:15:58] <%Ninestempest> i have literally done levi in liek 45 minutes
[0:16:01] <Veteranhelldiver17> im so happy that destiny made a comeback
[0:16:03] <%Iccirrus> That respawn bug has been fixed for over a year @shadowsofpain
[0:16:04] <shadowsofpain> @mrcooperblack Mr. guitar would like a word with you lol
[0:16:04] <+mrcooperblack> that's why in the raids you get gear after every encounter so you have a chance to get *something*
[0:16:06] <KnightAsteran> Savage is very harder, but comparatively waaaay shorter
[0:16:11] <+SubSamwich> your team was shit, raids don't take that long
[0:16:12] <ozuma35> well the raids can be done in 30-45 mins now
[0:16:15] <fox_olive> menagerie is really nice, mini matchmade raids
[0:16:17] <OnyxMemory> Savage is much harder than anything in destiny imo
[0:16:19] <%Kirby_Sauce> It's super fast now pat
[0:16:20] <%spookycool> sounds like your team sucks
[0:16:23] <+Pyroclase> Raids are 30-45 minutes yeah
[0:16:29] <+Grayhammatter> who's talking?
[0:16:29] <%QueequegTheater> PAIG LIVES
[0:16:32] <%Zamorouskiwhich> Who said that??
[0:16:32] <%ThatOneGameTester> The wildstar datascape took quite a bit of time
[0:16:34] <+mrcooperblack> i don't answer outside lines

[0:16:55] <%QueequegTheater> WHO'S VERTIGOING
[0:16:55] <SerenityVerse> thats how is was back when you had 2 primary weapons pat. with the new system that was introduced in forsaken DPS is alot easier
[0:16:58] <%spookycool> there was no prime
[0:16:59] <%korth367> !uptime
[0:17:00] <@Moobot> I've been playing this game for how long? Oh only 3h 35m.
[0:17:07] <%JoeJotaro> y'know what, Pat is completely right. a video game should be fun. not taxing with stupid bs
[0:17:11] <KaliasTV> Guardian damage is so high people don't even see boss mechanics any more
[0:17:12] <%Bailey__gaming> Spooky Ghost Paige hey how's ya feeling?
[0:17:21] <%totesmcgoat_> You can dismantle blues from the postmaster screen
[0:17:28] <%spookycool> figuring stuff out with your friends is fun
[0:17:29] <+SubSamwich> SPIKE NADES
[0:17:30] <%QueequegTheater> Does D2 have matchmaking for raids?

[0:17:36] <shadowsofpain> you motherfucker
[0:17:36] <+Ryan1016> SPIKE NADES
[0:17:37] <0mnius> None of the raids (other than Spire) are even that hard as long as your fireteam has an IQ above room temperature
[0:17:37] <+Pyroclase> good roll!
[0:17:38] <%ThatOneGameTester> i'm one of the only people who cleared every raid wildstar launched with, as it was at launch
[0:17:40] <%arcaderabbit48> Oh hey, Woolie is here for the podcast and he brought the Paige puppet!
[0:17:42] <shinigami40297> spike nades and auto loader is pretty decent
[0:17:42] <startstoprepeat> spike nade 150 is best dps
[0:17:45] <+jwimz> Spike grenade
[0:17:49] <EpslionBear> it has spikes and autoloading its automaticlly 8/10
[0:17:49] <seycheles> big paters
[0:17:50] <RamenRiderZ> big damage
[0:17:54] <Chainsaw105> the raid respawn timer also isn't 30 seconds anymore
[0:17:55] <+jwimz> That’s a good roll
[0:17:56] <+SubSamwich> spike = instant god roll on aggressive GLs
[0:17:59] <alexmemes> Keep it!

[0:18:23] <%President_Miyazaki> Are you at the point of needing the handcannon kills in strikes now?
[0:18:28] <%arcaderabbit48> What's your team size for raids in this game?
[0:18:29] <megaminimechamocha> More like Pat Stares CAT (cuz Elmo)
[0:18:30] <poooflingerz> Yes
[0:18:32] <%dekkitout> See if Banshee has any bounties
[0:18:33] <ScreamLord> @AngriestPat The Windigo Heavy Grenade Launcher is godlike. I highly recommend grinding for it
[0:18:38] <%ThatOneGameTester> So this game looks neat, probably gonna pick it up once it comes to steam
[0:18:40] <0mnius> @arcaderabbit48 raids are 6man teams

[0:22:39] <Tucker0603> no
[0:22:39] <SomersaultJustice> time to wipe on TG Destinyman and be late to the podcast
[0:22:40] <%Iccirrus> Yeah, it just works
[0:22:40] <+SubSamwich> yeah, it just happens
[0:22:40] <%Aeoneth> yes it's innate
[0:22:40] <%totesmcgoat_> no random
[0:22:41] <shadowsofpain> nope you got lucky
[0:22:44] <Tucker0603> it's a perk
[0:22:45] <%king_wragles> that's a pretty gun @AngriestPat
[0:22:47] <King_Wolf_Rigger> dang, oh well.
[0:22:47] <OnyxMemory> explosive isnt that good anymore
[0:22:48] <+informedotaku> podcast not live right? being done over Discord.
[0:22:49] <+jwimz> Random
[0:22:49] <%spookycool> this one rules
[0:22:50] <+mrcooperblack> Nope. It's liklier to get on certain weapons
[0:22:51] <+Fynale> @AngriestPat each slot per gun has a pool to pull from
[0:22:51] <+aogman> it's a roll
[0:22:51] <%ColonelRozum> no @EpitaphOfOndri
[0:22:52] <KaliasTV> An old friend is here
[0:22:57] <%totesmcgoat_> fun strike
[0:22:59] <%Aeoneth> Judgement is at hand
[0:23:00] <%demegodz> wait for the others to spawn
[0:23:02] <shadowsofpain> oh I like this one a lot
[0:23:02] <%Iccirrus> explosive is fine
[0:23:03] <$valriot> IMPRESS YOUR WARDEN, YES
[0:23:05] <alexmemes> Explosive is meh
[0:23:07] <RamenRiderZ> One guy
[0:23:09] <%Iccirrus> it's essentially a free range boost
[0:23:10] <%demegodz> explosive is good still
[0:23:12] <+Pyroclase> CABAL ON THE MARCH
[0:23:13] <%Bailey__gaming> my fave strike
[0:23:13] <%arcaderabbit48> Woolie is currently in Japan, so the podcast will be done over Discord. I do not think they will be doing it live.
[0:23:13] <+SubSamwich> it's fine, but not a godlike perk anymore
[0:23:15] <%Iccirrus> because the explosive part doesn't have falloff
[0:23:15] <FennecZephyr> It got nerfed hard
[0:23:16] <+mrcooperblack> ya'll chill, the gun is good
[0:23:17] <+rendingmelody> man this makes me wana play warframe, heh
[0:23:18] <OnyxMemory> rampage kill clip or dragonfly is what the good pve perks are for primaries
[0:23:19] <shadowsofpain> give it a frw
[0:23:20] <%totesmcgoat_> Nothing has loaded yet
[0:23:20] <+Pigg1yJuffs> I would've lost shit if he got that Trust masterworked as well with the Range boost.
[0:23:23] <%totesmcgoat_> there we go
[0:23:23] <Tucker0603> explosive is ok, timed is better
[0:23:27] <%BlackJack607> Is it weird I prefer anthem over destiny simply because I enjoy power armor...
[0:23:28] <+mrcooperblack> lies
[0:23:28] <+jwimz> Okay but there are better perks
[0:23:28] <%Segartner> Damn, i wanna donate but i wanna be able to eat too
[0:23:34] <FennecZephyr> It's still nice, but it's not amazing like it was before
[0:23:34] <+Fynale> ppl with inferior set ups were in your strike team
[0:23:34] <%spookycool> did he buy the nightfall card from xur
[0:23:35] <alexmemes> Still a good gun
[0:23:39] <%psychodave1234> you loaded in quicker than the mobs, goddamn
[0:23:39] <mojomoud> I eould still keep that Trust because Outlaw is great on handcannons
[0:23:42] <King_Wolf_Rigger> WACKADOO
[0:23:42] <+Pyroclase> @BlackJack607 Uhnm I have bad news for you
[0:23:46] <+mrcooperblack> @Tucker0603 i get your preference but they're both about the same
[0:23:49] <alexmemes> But better rolls exist
[0:23:49] <%Kirby_Sauce> VARIKS
[0:23:56] <Tucker0603> still good roll
[0:23:58] <%BlackJack607> I hear anthem has gotten better.
[0:24:04] <%Aeoneth> Have you done the Blind Well in the Dreaming City yet Pat?
[0:24:04] <+Fynale> The Ballsiest boss in destiny 2
[0:24:06] <shadowsofpain> it's the beat perk for PvP though. gives a little bit of screen shake so it can save you a few times
[0:24:07] <%GarbageNirvana> Wonder if we're gonna get to properly see Variks again
[0:24:07] <%arcaderabbit48> I'll try this game out when it goes free in October, but I dont see myself sticking with it. A lot of this stuff looks like the kind of thing Id bounce off of.
[0:24:08] <%ArcanumMBD> Thats a lot of subtitle
[0:24:09] <%GarbageNirvana> And if he'll be a bad guy
[0:24:14] <+Pyroclase> Pat if you scope in with that RL it seeks out targets
[0:24:14] <FennecZephyr> Isn't that a tracking rocket?
[0:24:22] <%Boscuito> i coulda swore i saw one drop
[0:24:28] <Tucker0603> @mrcooperblack it just feels great on my crimils dagger
[0:24:30] <King_Wolf_Rigger> Anthem is better than Division 2
[0:24:34] <King_Wolf_Rigger> fight me
[0:24:34] <%Bailey__gaming> choo choo
[0:24:35] <%arcaderabbit48> I cant imagine spending hours grinding a specific gun, have the gun drop, only for it to have shitty mods on it
[0:24:43] <%GarbageNirvana> Eating paste is better than Division 2
[0:24:43] <%Boscuito> my messages will only ever be seen when im wrong
[0:24:44] <%Kirby_Sauce> Clip him when he gets hit by train
[0:24:54] <KaliasTV> Zenobia-D is tracking, yeah
[0:24:56] <alexmemes> Yep, zenobia tracks
[0:25:01] <+SubSamwich> teammate is too far ahead, so trains stopped spawning up there
[0:25:28] <%Gray_skies1993> I think the Pikes are pretty cool vehicles honestly
[0:25:43] <alexmemes> I wish interceptors got more play
[0:25:49] <Tomschiii> yo, thats a cool looking lvl
[0:26:09] <SaltyBrim> I think you can mount up at this part
[0:26:18] <+sorcha> you can take out your sparrow
[0:26:18] <+Theworld732> you can summon your sparrow here
[0:26:20] <+aogman> @angriestpat can sparrow in here
[0:26:24] <KaliasTV> Not on top though
[0:26:25] <%Kirby_Sauce> Use your sparrow
[0:26:25] <%Aeoneth> Someone needs their strike completeions for the Solstice Armor set
[0:26:31] <+Pyroclase> PAT SPARROW
[0:26:58] <shadowsofpain> the heavy pike is my favorite, sadly its used less than all other vehicles
[0:27:09] <+Pyroclase> I think tanks are even rarer
[0:27:11] <%spookycool> is there a stand called judy blue eyes
[0:27:21] <Tomschiii> goodness, slowly i want to play/start destiny myself
[0:27:26] <%BlackJack607> @Pyroclase Has anthem really not gotten any better?
[0:27:29] <shadowsofpain> Tanks have a whole raid to shine though
[0:27:31] <%Bailey__gaming> thanks train
[0:27:38] <alexmemes> And zero hour
[0:27:39] <+Pyroclase> I hear there's the cataclysm even but I also hear it's barely any good
[0:27:42] <+aogman> @tomschiii it's the best time to start now
[0:27:43] <%Maids4lyfe> a robot
[0:27:43] <KaliasTV> He's a gameshow host
[0:27:44] <%Kirby_Sauce> VARIKS
[0:27:48] <+sorcha> from destiny one
[0:27:48] <+aogman> real fun
[0:27:49] <King_Wolf_Rigger> He ain't no HEK, that's for sure.
[0:27:49] <%demegodz> dude from first game
[0:27:49] <ozuma35> d1
[0:27:49] <%Iccirrus> D1 DLC guy
[0:27:50] <+Pyroclase> Variks is the warden
[0:27:51] <%Aeoneth> character from D1
[0:27:51] <OnyxMemory> NPC from d1
[0:27:51] <Tucker0603> from D1
[0:27:52] <%Maids4lyfe> Variks was a npc from destiny 1
[0:27:52] <@thenefftw> D1 character
[0:27:52] <%Kirby_Sauce> Variks is variks
[0:27:53] <%TubeMan642> Destiny 1 npc
[0:27:53] <+DrN0rd> yeeeessss
[0:27:53] <+neojadan> He's a guy who was much cooler in Destiny 1
[0:27:55] <IminyourBase> i didn't know they made a worse version of Warframe
[0:27:55] <startstoprepeat> the fallen warden who ran this prison had a robot, the robot is now crazy
[0:27:56] <shadowsofpain> D1 dude
[0:27:57] <$valriot> Variks is a Destiny 1 character a he's a VERY GOOD BOY
[0:27:58] <Tucker0603> good guy Fallen
[0:27:58] <%psychodave1234> he ran the prison of elders mode
[0:27:59] <%ssjklyco> I think he was the baddie in D1
[0:27:59] <%Iccirrus> he was a cool fallen,until he decided to cause the prison break
[0:28:00] <%totesmcgoat_> Variks the Loyal
[0:28:01] <+mrcooperblack> you're playing a sequel
[0:28:02] <alexmemes> Variks was my least favourite part of HoW
[0:28:03] <derekwst3> ITS ME.....DIO
[0:28:03] <%Kirby_Sauce> Friendly fallen
[0:28:03] <Arweynn> Variks from the reef in d1
[0:28:04] <%psychodave1234> best boi
[0:28:07] <TurtlesAndTentacles> @AngriestPat Should have played season 1 of Destiny 1 to know
[0:28:07] <alexmemes> Can’t stand that VO
[0:28:09] <%GarbageNirvana> He was the guy who gave you Prison of Elders bounties and narrated that mode
[0:28:10] <Tomschiii> @aogman is it? not when it goes "f2p" in october?
[0:28:12] <MrIntake> yes :)
[0:28:15] <%GarbageNirvana> In the Reef in D1
[0:28:18] <%Ranryu692> this game seems bad
[0:28:19] <TurtlesAndTentacles> Variks was cool
[0:28:21] <Ion_Laser> welp...
[0:28:25] <+sorcha> crazy how the sequel almost expected you to play the first one
[0:28:25] <TurtlesAndTentacles> You are the fool
[0:28:29] <%President_Miyazaki> But Pat, all the lore for Destiny 1 was on the PC anyways.
[0:28:31] <%psychodave1234> stop bein salt pat just enjoy
[0:28:37] <dredshift> Is the lore still shunted off to the website?
[0:28:40] <%Kirby_Sauce> Wasn't variks in one of the foresaken cutscenes?
[0:28:44] <%Maids4lyfe> no your character doesn't react it's YOUR GHOST that knows Variks
[0:28:45] <shinigami40297> Well he betrayed the awoken before forsaken so he is the reason the barons and Uldren escaped and killed Cayde
[0:28:47] <%Iccirrus> I mean, in base D2 they DID make it so they explained everything to you if you didn't have a linked D1 account, but it was shitty
[0:28:48] <+alpacasintophats> cannoicly speaking D1 chara and D2 chara are the same
[0:28:49] <+aogman> @tomschiii that's kind of the time I meant
[0:28:52] <alexmemes> Lore is in game now
[0:28:52] <%Nobrev> pat's mad there's a hole in his knowledge
[0:28:56] <shadowsofpain> @dredshift Nope in game now
[0:28:58] <%Iccirrus> And everybody hated it
[0:28:59] <MrIntake> @President_Miyazaki and you didnt need to buy d1 to know the lore squadLaugh
[0:29:00] <%psychodave1234> @dredshift most of it is in lore tabs now
[0:29:07] <+informedotaku> you miss the boat on one, just a nod for people who have been playing longer
[0:29:14] <King_Wolf_Rigger> If he starts screaming about people breathing air, he might get better.
[0:29:40] <alexmemes> chicken noises ensue
[0:29:45] <+Pyroclase> DISMANTLE MINES, YESSSSS?
[0:29:46] <%totesmcgoat_> It's a sequel, Pat. What do you want? Do you want D1 vets to be forgotten about and treated like a child when they already know these things?
[0:29:48] <+Pyroclase> OR YOU DIE
[0:29:49] <%Kirby_Sauce> Watch him him use cannon wrong now
[0:29:49] <%Gray_skies1993> @AngriestPat your Ghost is the one who knows Variks
[0:29:49] <TurtlesAndTentacles> I remember this place on the Prisoner of Elders
[0:29:50] <+Nekolaius> ooh this is a good one
[0:29:50] <+TheBitingIrish> YoU dIe!
[0:29:51] <%king_wragles> Did he just caw at us?
[0:29:53] <%Segartner> DISMANTLE MINES, YESSSSS?
[0:29:57] <TurtlesAndTentacles> SIT ON THE MINE
[0:30:02] <+Nekolaius> yo warlock master race
[0:30:05] <alexmemes> Bacawk!
[0:30:06] <RamenRiderZ> Mechanics are for cars
[0:30:13] <Tomschiii> @aogman well, its late august so i have to wait a little bit for october :P
[0:30:18] <shinigami40297> Rampage lasts 2.5-3 seconds without the rampage spec mod
[0:30:23] <+informedotaku> this part of the mission was a cool mode in D1. pretty tough back then, felt cool to wreck it in here
[0:30:49] <alexmemes> Skolas though
[0:30:49] <shadowsofpain> @michael_erazo Memories of Skolas
[0:30:50] <madskull456> POE had some cool looking weapons
[0:30:51] <+Pyroclase> yeah those teleport
[0:30:55] <kindashagg> razzle dazzle
[0:31:00] <%psychodave1234> dregen tho
[0:31:06] <+Evitron1> god i miss perfect paradox
[0:31:10] <%Starlight_Gamer> is this prision of elders?
[0:31:13] <Tomschiii> are the classes of any importance because there are only 3 or 4?
[0:31:20] <%Bailey__gaming> it's set in it
[0:31:23] <+aogman> yeah they play very different
[0:31:24] <shadowsofpain> Pass the space aids to keep Skolas from wiping us
[0:31:25] <TurtlesAndTentacles> Wow the computer messes up everything huh?
[0:31:31] <+aogman> the 3 of them
[0:31:36] <+Pyroclase> @Tomschiii What do you mean?
[0:31:41] <%Kirby_Sauce> Return to airlock. GUARDIAN
[0:31:49] <%Gray_skies1993> @TurtlesAndTentacles after Variks left, yeah
[0:31:53] <MrIntake> squadLaugh squadLaugh squadLaugh
[0:32:01] <%spookycool> STAND PROUD
[0:32:03] <%Nobrev> @shadowsofpain remember when you could just block skolas's corruption shit with a sword
[0:32:13] <TurtlesAndTentacles> @Gray_skies1993 well at least Variks lies
[0:32:13] <%Bailey__gaming> Stannnnnddddd prrrrrroud
[0:32:15] <TurtlesAndTentacles> Lives
[0:32:17] <Thepothero> Man I miss d1 content
[0:32:17] <+Evitron1> Mines. Defuse them, yes? Orrrrrrr you D I E.
[0:32:18] <CopperTucker> I'm back, what did I miss
[0:32:19] <+TheBitingIrish> You know there's an achievement for avoiding the bubble?
[0:32:23] <Tomschiii> @Pyroclase i know that destiny is only about the guns. qustion is if the class make the gameplay so much more different?
[0:32:24] <King_Wolf_Rigger> I can see what they were going for, but the VO doesn't really do it here.
[0:32:27] <alexmemes> Raze lighter and solar burn
[0:32:27] <%king_wragles> This guy is annoying
[0:32:29] <+Pigg1yJuffs> I can't wait to see Variks again when that Fallen civil war happens. I like Variks a lot, but I gotta rep my boi Miithrax.
[0:32:30] <shadowsofpain> @nobrev fun times, you could Block the oversoul in Crota too
[0:32:33] <alexmemes> Oof
[0:32:50] <ChloroShepard> judgment at haaand
[0:32:54] <+Pyroclase> @Tomschiii Each class has multiple subclasses that all play very differently. It's larely a matter of personal preference which you play. they do, at least, feel different
[0:33:01] <kindashagg> Oh hey a beholder
[0:33:03] <alexmemes> Boss dead in 3 2 1
[0:33:04] <%psychodave1234> he literally said the servitor was down here tho
[0:33:05] <+Evitron1> end that man's career
[0:33:06] <%Kirby_Sauce> It's not JUST a servitor though
[0:33:10] <%demegodz> oof
[0:33:14] <+TheBitingIrish> RIP in piss
[0:33:14] <%TubeMan642> Pat background for that strike the Prison of Elders was controlled by a character named Variks the Loyal a good Fallen npc who had a hoard game mode in D1 he went missing in Forsaken
[0:33:15] <KaliasTV> That guy needs 10x health
[0:33:15] <+aslfrasle> It's a servitor but it thinks it's a Variks.
[0:33:20] <%Zamorouskiwhich> Boss has no immune phase, so its gg LUL
[0:33:25] <Tucker0603> the servitor thinks he's variks
[0:33:27] <Thepothero> Gambit theme cirSlain xxxJA
[0:33:35] <%goose_attack_almanac> oh boy
[0:33:37] <%goose_attack_almanac> Fodder
[0:33:41] <TurtlesAndTentacles> Wow
[0:33:41] <alexmemes> You never see his mechanics anymore
[0:33:46] <startstoprepeat> drifter's the best
[0:33:50] <Tomschiii> @Pyroclase oh, thats exactly what i wanted to know. if those 3 classes will stay like that from beginning to end but if there are subclasses then its ok
[0:33:53] <%korth367> the fuck is this dialogue tho
[0:33:53] <%dekkitout> Drifter's got... issues
[0:33:57] <%shotgunspaghetti> apatBig apatBig apatBig apatBig apatBig
[0:33:58] <TurtlesAndTentacles> Drifter can eat a fat one
[0:34:04] <%Iccirrus> Watch Byf's videos
[0:34:04] <%Kirby_Sauce> Not just any servitor, that's the big flamey one from proson of elders
[0:34:05] <%GarbageNirvana> Drifter doesn't like ghosts
[0:34:06] <%Piemen99> Ehhh one more game
[0:34:06] <+Evitron1> drifter is...a special boy
[0:34:08] <%Iccirrus> Byf does the big info
[0:34:12] <+Crimsonpajamas > yep
[0:34:13] <%Zamorouskiwhich> That is very accurate
[0:34:14] <%Iccirrus> he'll teach you the things
[0:34:15] <%Bailey__gaming> drifter is a prissy baby
[0:34:16] <0mnius> Nah that would be Warframe
[0:34:18] <Ion_Laser> yup that's true
[0:34:21] <%ThatOneGameTester> that's funny
[0:34:21] <+informedotaku> it's doing the dark souls route
[0:34:22] <startstoprepeat> yeah no kidding
[0:34:24] <%Kirby_Sauce> So does Vaati
[0:34:26] <%psychodave1234> bye-f
[0:34:27] <%Gray_skies1993> @AngriestPat as said by @TubeMan642 Pat background for that strike the Prison of Elders was controlled by a character named Variks the Loyal a good Fallen npc who had a hoard game mode in D1 he went missing in Forsaken
[0:34:27] <IndoorSitup> Lore isn't even that good.
[0:34:28] <%pilgrimsayswhat> He's a big DORK
[0:34:28] <%ArcanumMBD> Dark Souls trickles the lore to you. Destiny jam packs as much lore as it can into everything that isn't the game
[0:34:28] <shadowsofpain> Drifter is complicated
[0:34:29] <%GarbageNirvana> Pretty much
[0:34:29] <+Theworld732> The lore is super cool but yeah it should be more upfront
[0:34:29] <@thenefftw> There's a lot of lore
[0:34:29] <%Kirby_Sauce> Same job
[0:34:31] <alexmemes> Drifter would eat a ghost given the chance
[0:34:33] <shinigami40297> I mean if you earn the Variks Lore Book its right there for you to read in game
[0:34:35] <%ssjklyco> Destiny 1s lore was just "here is a card with a code to go online to read
[0:34:35] <OnyxMemory> to be fair vaati has a lot as well
[0:34:36] <%psychodave1234> byf is pronounced bye-f
[0:34:36] <RamenRiderZ> Drifter was around when Guardians were assholes
[0:34:38] <+Pyroclase> @Tomschiii For instance, warlock has the giant death beam PAt's been using, but there's also one where you float around and spray chain lightning, and one where you place a giant field that buffs and heals you and your allies
[0:34:48] <+AHolyCorndog> biff lmao
[0:34:49] <+aslfrasle> And you should watch all of them or get used to not knowing things.
[0:34:51] <IndoorSitup> Also Byf's videos are garbage, just do some reading.
[0:34:54] <%psychodave1234> nononononono
[0:34:55] <shadowsofpain> @alexmemes According to the chromicon that's how he'll go
[0:35:01] <%psychodave1234> no space like that
[0:35:03] <startstoprepeat> rhymes with life
[0:35:06] <%psychodave1234> byef
[0:35:06] <+SubSamwich> baif, like wife
[0:35:06] <%Maids4lyfe> he's british
[0:35:08] <+Pyroclase> Because it's a space name Pat
[0:35:08] <%ThatOneGameTester> he's not the bully from back to the future?
[0:35:09] <%Segartner> it's pronounced Baif
[0:35:12] <FennecZephyr> @AngriestPat It's Bife, like Cloude Strife
[0:35:13] <shinigami40297> Because its not
[0:35:14] <%Maids4lyfe> he's british that's why
[0:35:15] <%Kirby_Sauce> Because his name is byf
[0:35:16] <ChloroShepard> he's british lol
[0:35:16] <%ssjklyco> It's a Bith confusing
[0:35:17] <Tucker0603> Byeff
[0:35:17] <+Evitron1> his last name is Byford or something
[0:35:19] <%totesmcgoat_> That's his name man
[0:35:20] <+aslfrasle> Bife
[0:35:20] <%Piemen99> it's not pronouced biff?
[0:35:24] <%dekkitout> He's Engliish
[0:35:25] <%vectorless_peon> URSH
[0:35:25] <%psychodave1234> just watch 10 seconds of any video
[0:35:25] <ozuma35> because the letter Y
[0:35:27] <corepercentlives> why are babies in death stranding bibis
[0:35:28] <%cureneckbeard> biff
[0:35:30] <alexmemes> @shadowsofpain Yeah that was a fun read!
[0:35:31] <ozuma35> byf
[0:35:35] <shinigami40297> its pronoucned like eye B eye F
[0:35:36] <%psychodave1234> GREETINGS GUARDIANS, MYNAMEISBYF HERE
[0:35:36] <%dekkitout> All lore dudes are English, like Vaati
[0:35:36] <dredshift> Is that Squidward?
[0:35:38] <%pilgrimsayswhat> He's good but that latin outro thing he does makes me cringe
[0:35:39] <%Iccirrus> I mean, eye isn't pronounced ih
[0:35:39] <%lichkind101> lichkind101 subscribed at Tier 1. They've subscribed for 17 months, currently on a 10 month streak! Holy shit, almost 18 months subbed to you, been watching since the beginning of the YouTube channel. Keep on keepin on and keep the goblins away
[0:35:40] <KaliasTV> It's pronounced brexyf
[0:35:44] <%hatesdps> CUM GUARDIAN
[0:35:44] <FrankysDream> cumguardian
[0:35:47] <FennecZephyr> That's decent
[0:35:48] <Tucker0603> yes
[0:35:48] <startstoprepeat> vault it
[0:35:50] <%totesmcgoat_> infuse
[0:35:52] <%Maids4lyfe> you can infuse it into a better gun
[0:35:53] <sirrice77> infuse
[0:35:55] <%psychodave1234> big number do big damanges
[0:35:55] <ChloroShepard> no word from fenchurch today
[0:35:59] <Tucker0603> infuse it into something
[0:35:59] <+aslfrasle> infuse
[0:35:59] <shadowsofpain> very big trash
[0:36:01] <%GarbageNirvana> Use it to buff something better
[0:36:10] <OnyxMemory> no point infusing and wasting materials when its gonna be up to 750 in a month
[0:36:11] <+Evitron1> badlander is actually pretty good if you get solid perks on it but yknow
[0:36:15] <%totesmcgoat_> random rolls giveth, random rolls taketh away
[0:36:17] <OnyxMemory> should save for shadowkeep
[0:36:19] <%Aeoneth> Alright quick lore rundown on Varriks: Varriks is a Fallen that swore fealty to the Queen of the Reef. He was originally a keeper to the House of Wolves but when the Queen beat the Wolves he turned with the bulk of their forces. In D1, Varriks was the Warden of the Prison of Elders, a massive space jail that holds the worse criminals in the star system
[0:36:20] <%totesmcgoat_> then vault it
[0:36:20] <KaliasTV> Infusing worthless now with everything set to 750 soon
[0:36:21] <%Segartner> DON'T INFUSE ANYTHING+}
[0:36:26] <+Theworld732> you can buy resources from spider
[0:36:27] <FennecZephyr> Just keep it. Autolloading is decent for specials anyway
[0:36:29] <shinigami40297> Dont infuse everything you have will be auto made 750 on Oct 1
[0:36:32] <shadowsofpain> vault it until resources became not scarce
[0:36:34] <Strayed1> don't infuse until you get 750 gear
[0:36:35] <+Evitron1> oh yeah dont infuse anything. shadowkeep give the big upgrade
[0:36:36] <%cureneckbeard> What if you need the resources later
[0:36:37] <shinigami40297> literally a waste unless you wanna raid
[0:36:44] <%Aeoneth> Varriks hosted a game for the Guardians in the Prison of Elders that was basically a horde mode event
[0:36:45] <%psychodave1234> give item do big damage big number
[0:36:46] <FennecZephyr> DAS SOME GOOD GLOVES
[0:36:47] <%Segartner> eeveryone will be 750 in shadowkeep
[0:36:48] <alexmemes> Feel free to infuse cos you can get so many cores before Oct 1
[0:37:02] <Tomschiii> @Pyroclase so its only about the skills one can use. nothing like less defense to to being a mage class for example?
[0:37:04] <%arcaderabbit48> @cureneckbeard In a game like Destiny or Warframe, I feel like that is an actually legitimate concern though
[0:37:08] <FennecZephyr> Special scavenger is what I look for first
[0:37:09] <shadowsofpain> not bad, it's got both sniper and shotgun scavenger perka
[0:37:12] <%psychodave1234> i tell by big number
[0:37:14] <Strayed1> the perks
[0:37:17] <+AHolyCorndog> Why dont you do the solstice armor?
[0:37:17] <Chainsaw105> fastball
[0:37:18] <+spiceyweasle> you can infuse the exact same weapon if you have an older masterwork for just glimmer
[0:37:18] <OnyxMemory> scavenger and reloader perks
[0:37:19] <shinigami40297> they are alright
[0:37:20] <%Ninestempest> you have to know what perks you want
[0:37:23] <KaliasTV> Sniper and shotgun scav are pvp god perks
[0:37:24] <%Ninestempest> scavengers are good
[0:37:25] <+aslfrasle> perks
[0:37:26] <alexmemes> Like shotguns or snipers? Good gloves.
[0:37:29] <%Aeoneth> certain scav perks are ideal
[0:37:34] <shadowsofpain> perk symbols just kind of stick
[0:37:35] <+Pyroclase> @Tomschiii All classes have the same movement speed and health. It is only useable abilities that differ, as well as armor items with unique properties that are class-specific
[0:37:39] <alexmemes> Scavenger perk is good almost every time
[0:37:51] <+Takuatt> Does he not need to collect his arc and RL bounties or did he just do that?
[0:37:59] <extradopeness> !uptime
[0:38:00] <@Moobot> I've been playing this game for how long? Oh only 3h 56m.
[0:38:20] <Strayed1> no
[0:38:23] <%dekkitout> Nope
[0:38:25] <%totesmcgoat_> Perks on armor is subjective. What kind of loadout do you enjoy? Handcannons? Get perks that make using handcannons better. Like having Heavy ammo? Use heavy ammo finder perk
[0:38:25] <MasterDecoder> Yes and No, it's weird
[0:38:25] <%Ninestempest> just get power to 700 at some point
[0:38:28] <KaliasTV> Power only matter if you are doing the high level raids
[0:38:28] <OnyxMemory> power matters for endgame activities
[0:38:28] <+Pyroclase> You joined right before a huge expansion laucnh, so not really
[0:38:32] <%cureneckbeard> hey your man is floaty.
[0:38:32] <%totesmcgoat_> It's subjective
[0:38:40] <+johnny_gogo> @AngriestPat when are you going to play a real shlooter like Anthem
[0:38:40] <%Tearonex> !uptime
[0:38:41] <@Moobot> I've been playing this game for how long? Oh only 3h 57m.
[0:38:43] <MasterDecoder> Awesome, I just cut my thumb open
[0:38:45] <%dekkitout> Just farm upgrade mats and well rolled gear
[0:38:46] <%pilgrimsayswhat> Hey a robot ghost
[0:38:54] <cosmicdischarge> is pat,Cumbo?
[0:38:54] <shadowsofpain> power only matters when invading in gambit, Iron Banner, or raids
[0:38:56] <%GarbageNirvana> Totally not dead
[0:38:59] <KaliasTV> It's how this strike is
[0:39:01] <+d00msdaydan> this strike starts in a darkness zone
[0:39:02] <OnyxMemory> heroic menagerie
[0:39:11] <shadowsofpain> oh yeah and that
[0:39:11] <shinigami40297> It matters to be above 735 if you wanna raid, otherwise above 690 to do matchmade content
[0:39:19] <TurtlesAndTentacles> Cayde? Arent you dead?
[0:39:27] <RamenRiderZ> Old strike
[0:39:31] <Tomschiii> @Pyroclase oh, alrighty then. good to know, thank you my friend
[0:39:45] <+Pyroclase> Glad to help! <3
[0:39:46] <%Estuko> It's neat, but it just makes me miss Halo. Plus I'm here more for Pat every time lol
[0:39:51] <+bonzosan> just crush it harder, gamer
[0:39:59] <%Tearonex> not surprised, since this is one of the very first strikes
[0:40:42] <%totesmcgoat_> spike grenades baybeeee
[0:40:48] <alexmemes> There’s 2 activities you need higher power for right now. Crown of Sorrow raid and heroic menagerie, so you’re basically good unless you just want to make number go big
[0:40:52] <%Gray_skies1993> man I love the Ghost-Cayde banter (RIP Cayde)
[0:41:02] <%Stay_Hydrated_Bot> @angriestpat stayhyBottle You've been live for just over 4 hours. By this point in your broadcast you should have consumed at least 16oz (480mL) of water to maintain optimum hydration.
[0:41:02] <%totesmcgoat_> good use of super
[0:41:08] <%psychodave1234> much fast
[0:41:36] <%psychodave1234> aww cayde...
[0:41:46] <King_Wolf_Rigger> If this were the Star Wars universe, Cayde wouldn't be dead cuz no one's ever REALLY gone
[0:41:57] <%StripesUltimateEdition> go away cayde
[0:41:59] <+asgard147> Thanks Hydro Bot limesSip
[0:42:02] <%StripesUltimateEdition> 😡 stay dead 😡
[0:42:10] <RamenRiderZ> bruh
[0:42:11] <$valriot> Man I'm glad Cayde is dead
[0:42:23] <Chainsaw105> fun fact: A drake tank has a chance of spawning here
[0:42:26] <%psychodave1234> hey stripes? valriot? apatWrong apatWrong
[0:42:35] <%StripesUltimateEdition> you know what I said
[0:42:39] <Obiwannabe92> Nathan Filions characters have as much success as surviving as his shows
[0:42:39] <+Pyroclase> WHAT
[0:42:40] <%Estuko> monkaS
[0:42:40] <derekwst3> im finally reading past the anime from hunter x hunter, the chrollo v hisoka fight was awesome
[0:42:41] <+Dudealy> YOU DIED
[0:42:41] <ItIsSky> what?
[0:42:43] <%Neryl_> LUL
[0:42:43] <%demegodz> Oh
[0:42:47] <+HypotheticalWalrus> Oh god I think this map is burnt into my brain after running it so much
[0:42:49] <%psychodave1234> RESET THE CLOCK
[0:42:49] <+AHolyCorndog> Your team mate ran ahead and died
[0:42:49] <@thenefftw> Someone went ahead
[0:42:49] <OnyxMemory> the other guy was in the darkness zone and died
[0:42:51] <$OmegaWeltall> Nani desu ka?
[0:42:52] <%Starlight_Gamer> what?
[0:42:52] <+d00msdaydan> someone ran ahead into the darkness zone and died
[0:42:53] <$valriot> Drake Tank? like Hotline Bling?
[0:42:53] <+asgard147> wut?
[0:42:53] <@thenefftw> Yeah, that's what I thought
[0:42:54] <%Aeoneth> ... the fuck?
[0:42:54] <+Pyroclase> PAT STOP BREAKNG DESTINY
[0:42:55] <%ssjklyco> Did you win?
[0:42:56] <%Maids4lyfe> no
[0:42:57] <Strayed1> dude went ahead and died
[0:42:59] <GovernorNacho> chibiDis
[0:43:01] <%Maids4lyfe> your teammate died
[0:43:01] <%StripesUltimateEdition> ???
[0:43:01] <KaliasTV> Picked up by a pubbie in the shared zone?
[0:43:02] <+bonzosan> someone died ahead of you
[0:43:04] <%cureneckbeard> HE DlED SOMEHOW
[0:43:05] <+d00msdaydan> if they're the only one in a darkness zone it wipes the whole team
[0:43:05] <OnyxMemory> someone was ahead of you in the darkness zone and died
[0:43:05] <%GarbageNirvana> You know they got Nolan North to do his best Nathan Fillion impression for the Forsaken intro
[0:43:06] <%Aeoneth> oh no someone else raced ahead and died i the next zone
[0:43:06] <%Nobrev> the last guy on your team went too far ahead and died @AngriestPat
[0:43:07] <+spiceyweasle> you got pulled ahead
[0:43:13] <RamenRiderZ> Someone rushed into Darkness Zone and died
[0:43:16] <%Ranryu692> cheer500 Hey Pat, have you heard of Fire Force? It's an anime from the creator of Soul Eater, made by David Productions, about fire fighters with fire-based superpowers fighting against fire demons? The first six episodes have been pretty good. Also, could you tell me to get over my mind goblins and actually chat in your discord? It's too intimidating lol
[0:43:25] <%dekkitout> That happens when there's only 1 person in the no fuckups zone
[0:43:27] <shadowsofpain> when Cayde was the only funny one it was great, but then every decided they wanted to be a comedian. but when he died he took all the comedy with him
[0:43:31] <%GarbageNirvana> @Ranryu692 Just do it nerd
[0:43:38] <King_Wolf_Rigger> Fire Force is super good
[0:43:44] <derekwst3> fire force, all characters have fire powers?
[0:43:46] <DesuDesuDokiDoki> patty cake
[0:43:58] <alexmemes> Wish they could have at least had Fillion for Cayde’s end... North is great but it’s very different in hindsight
[0:44:03] <+Takuatt> Has Bungie thought about adding a pursuit tracker on your HUD so you don't have to keep going to the screen?
[0:44:14] <%dekkitout> Fire Force's manga is great, but now I gotta wait so long for the Vergil to show up
[0:44:17] <+Ryan1016> @Takuatt Already in the game
[0:44:22] <RamenRiderZ> Why do firefighters use fire?
[0:44:28] <%dekkitout> That's the joke
[0:44:33] <+Takuatt> @Ryan1016 Ah okay, I guess Pat just isn't using it?
[0:44:34] <+SubSamwich> it exists, you just press select and ghost pulls up your tracked pursuits
[0:44:34] <King_Wolf_Rigger> @derekwst3 Mostly, there's a few who are pretty much normal and still kick ass cuz cool gadgets and they're stronk.
[0:44:37] <+Dudealy> If you shoot the under side of the tank treads (the jet looking things) it does super ultra bonus damage
[0:44:38] <dredshift> They fight with fire
[0:44:43] <dredshift> Hence, firefighters
[0:44:43] <shadowsofpain> the ability to turn off that super is great
[0:44:49] <+Ryan1016> Nope, you just have to pull out your ghost to see anything you're tracking
[0:44:57] <shadowsofpain> I wish every super was like it
[0:44:58] <%Ranryu692> @dekkitout I read the first chapter or two when they first came out, but then the site I was using went down, and I never picked it back up, so I'm very excited it got adapted
[0:45:15] <+Takuatt> Ah right I see now
[0:45:22] <OnyxMemory> you'll be happy when you get geomags
[0:45:27] <%Segartner> has pat unlocked all the other walock supers?
[0:45:31] <shadowsofpain> you never feel like your wasting it
[0:45:43] <shadowsofpain> helps with the goblins
[0:45:54] <OnyxMemory> free super at 70% and you can pretty much double the duration
[0:45:55] <King_Wolf_Rigger> Man, it's been what? Two years since Pat and Eli did this?
[0:46:15] <shadowsofpain> that's if you have the boots, the Geomags
[0:46:25] <startstoprepeat> that plus bad juju is a killer build
[0:46:37] <King_Wolf_Rigger> Should have him and Fuggins back on to do stuff.
[0:46:43] <shadowsofpain> oh the bad juju combo is great
[0:46:43] <$Sir_stride> so how goes the game?
[0:46:47] <%spookycool> pat if you do last wish you get a seed of light to unlock another super
[0:47:08] <dero45> Shooooot him
[0:47:09] <+SubSamwich> @spookycool that's just if you do one encounter of any Y2 raid
[0:47:11] <%Aeoneth> @spookycool he can also do Blind Well in the Dreaming City to unlock another
[0:47:16] <alexmemes> Blind Well T3 is easier for a Seed
[0:47:27] <weeamood> Bracus Zahn sounds like a Star Wars fan fiction name
[0:47:28] <%spookycool> isnt it random in blind well
[0:47:28] <shadowsofpain> you only need to do the first part, but they put a non raid way of getting it
[0:47:35] <alexmemes> TT3 is guaranteed
[0:47:36] <%totesmcgoat_> Pat make use shotgun good
[0:47:37] <+HypotheticalWalrus> Well thats substantially faster than the normal run
[0:47:39] <%king_wragles> Man that was hilarious, thank you Cayde for adding that without anyone asking
[0:47:44] <%spookycool> ah ok
[0:47:44] <%GarbageNirvana> So I'm two strikes away from clearing the conditions for the basic solstice armor but I wonder if it's even worth trying for it at this point
[0:47:44] <dero45> Didn’t beat this guy in under 3 secs noob
[0:47:51] <Ion_Laser> :D
[0:47:53] <King_Wolf_Rigger> I love garbage! I mean Elli.
[0:47:54] <%Laecerelius> Endless traaaaash!
[0:47:54] <dero45> lol
[0:47:58] <henshin2289> Any reason why you're not using devour?
[0:47:59] <%Aeoneth> @spookycool nope, just for your 1st T2+ run (i think) and another if you visit Mara's throne on Curse Week
[0:48:00] <Ion_Laser> ENDLESS TRASH
[0:48:04] <shadowsofpain> free core
[0:48:04] <wookie5358> Ellie's in the game?
[0:48:07] <OnyxMemory> pat you should spend your glimmer on mats at the spider
[0:48:09] <$valriot> Run content that doesn't give trash then
[0:48:12] <OnyxMemory> since you're capped
[0:48:18] <shadowsofpain> their was a gold nugget in that trash
[0:48:20] <Strayed1> its why no one runs strikes
[0:48:25] <%Aeoneth> 1 more week Pat
[0:48:30] <King_Wolf_Rigger> Ellie's in my heart, along with all the other garbage.
[0:48:31] <Madbearv> why are we here
[0:48:39] <+river_city98> fire
[0:48:43] <+d00msdaydan> don't forget the tactical nuns and combat exorcisms

[0:50:04] <%demegodz> @AngriestPat Didn't even answer the question of that dude about Fire Force
[0:50:05] <%arcaderabbit48> @cinder_chan Implied to be some elder god from beyond the stars, but we do not actually know
[0:50:07] <startstoprepeat> probably hold onto your tokens for shadowkeep
