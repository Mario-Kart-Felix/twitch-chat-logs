[0:35:00] <%Aracon_> BAGGED MILK IS REALLY WEIRD
[0:35:01] <$daveronald> an attack on our culture
[0:35:02] <Dragon_Batman> We're all just weird as fuck
[0:35:03] <%Piemen99> like life insurance
[0:35:03] <%Nexoosen> to be fair, i can see paige advocating "no one does X" when in fact, everyone does X
[0:35:03] <%Zaphire_Saucypants> lets just agree that everyone in North America is an asshole.
[0:35:03] <%Aracon_> AND REALLY DUMB
[0:35:06] <eltigre1296> Why is it in bags?

[0:46:17] <Croetec> the size of that switch
[0:46:18] <yourliteraldog> I rember the years in which capcom was huffing spray paint.
[0:46:18] <Ultimatefool> This game IS a marathon with how exhausting it is
[0:46:19] <%draugrix> that's because re6 is marathon
[0:46:20] <rhus> this is an RE6 marathon, the other games just happen to be in it

[0:46:22] <%Nope80808> Pot pies are just odd shaped hotpockets.

[0:46:42] <%WhereIsWill> why is this music so awful and generic
[0:46:43] <+EkinRaider> why is this twink following chris around
[0:46:44] <+SlumberMan> Capcom is doing a new RE continuity, so let's hope they make RE6 non-canon.

[0:47:34] <%rumtumtugnutz> This game looks good. Can you imagine if the game wasn't shitty?
[0:47:35] <yourliteraldog> That was striaght up from Prototype
[0:47:35] <AutechreTwinAphex> these are the most cancerous unfun to fight trash mobs ever

[0:48:03] <+OhioNitsud> i would love to see grubman kick his feet and dance
[0:48:04] <%Tieliva> so now that we're fighting revelations 1 esque monsters on a boat, is this supposed to be reminiscent of rev? or is it a fucking coincidence? do these assholes have the t-abyss? or j'avo? or the c virus? who knows
[0:48:07] <%Typhaeon> What tactical use is an air bag grub man
[0:48:08] <AutechreTwinAphex> like is this game Streets of Rage or is it Resident Evil?

[0:48:27] <%BabyandShar> BabyandShar subscribed with Twitch Prime. They've subscribed for 4 months! Jesus, another month gone by already? At least when you play garbage like RE6, you still make it entertaining to watch. Also, never beat Chris's or Ada's campaign fully, so I'll finally see how they end! Thanks Pat!
[0:48:27] <atgithursdays> This game may suck, but the movement mechanics do give you that feeling of Resident Evil: Vendetta
[0:48:28] <%Conyst> Pat you said months ago that you would play RE6 had you not put RE6 in the lineup of games you were playing there's a good chance that some of us would have commented how it was weird that they skipped six in the naming convention.
[0:48:30] <ShichiNoBushi> He reminds me of the Noise from Symphogear.
[0:48:30] <+mankeyfigh> Wow, this game REALLY DOESNT look like Resident Evil
[0:48:32] <%Frost_Quill> Explode and infect people maybe?
[0:48:33] <%tank7013> There's no way that thing wasn't an instant kill
[0:48:33] <%TheMattman1313> Your casualties turn into bombs
[0:48:34] <Mister_McDerp> how are any of these mutations supposed to be helpful?
[0:48:38] <+SlumberMan> @Tieliva I think it's just the C Virus. Meaining they're all JUST zombies.
[0:48:38] <%Laecerelius> HEY, DON'T MAKE FUN OF GRUB MAN! HE'S TRYING HIS BEST!
[0:48:40] <+FrontLineFluffyBunny> hes there to confuse you so that the grabby arm man can sneak attack you
[0:48:41] <chicken_brotherr> iirc the stag beetle is like an instant kill if it grabs you, right?
[0:48:42] <DesuDesuDokiDoki> what
[0:48:46] <AutechreTwinAphex> the movement mechanics might have been fun in a game that is actually fun - too bad this game ain't it
[0:48:47] <%Muzzle131> nice shooting there

[0:48:49] <%Frost_Quill> @Mister_McDerp The soldier guys seem to have SUPER useful shit.
[0:48:51] <%Parapattern> This feels like the videogame equivalent of a movie they'd make fun of in MST3K
[0:48:56] <%Roundelay11> God, this game is just making me want RE3 more
[0:49:01] <%Ner234> How much more of a pain in the ass would this game be if AI companions could die?
[0:49:02] <yourliteraldog> Plausible deniability you know how often terriost are able to find bioweapons in this universe
[0:49:02] <biomegabear> they remind me of FF13 enemies
[0:49:06] <%Tieliva> how are these supposed to be c virus though? they turn into weird t-abyss things and bugs. what the fuck is wrong with this game
[0:49:08] <%krawtch> BEETLEPEDE
[0:49:10] <thelonechris> Is it possible to get an enemy to mutate all of their limbs?
[0:49:11] <%Shadicara> HOOMAN

[0:50:00] <+SlumberMan> @Tieliva The C Virus zombies from Leon's campaigns huffed C Virus fumes, while these zombies got it directly injected. Somehow this makes them turn into bug people.
[0:50:00] <%Tieliva> TEN DUDES JANKING OUT IN A CORNER IS GOOD GAME DESIGN
[0:50:01] <AutechreTwinAphex> it transforms you into Birkin one second and then an insect the next
[0:50:01] <%Th3SmartAlec> Why

[0:50:16] <rangriz> So who supply Neo-umbrella with this huge ass military base and weaponry?...
[0:50:17] <+FrontLineFluffyBunny> RE6 should remain unchanged through the ages as a reminder to never EVER do this stupid shit again
[0:50:18] <%trekkie11041> @olaksi he didnt . his body heat got high enough to burn his cloths offf
[0:50:20] <AnacondaVirtue> God in Heaven, this music SUCKS

[1:08:34] <+creamandsugar> they only say shotguns got gimped because they changed how damage types worked and made status functional instead of only crit damage. Overall, shotguns got -more- damage. Especially since you no longer need 2 mods, one for your gun and one for your sentinel

[1:10:03] <%studleydoorite> if you had a grappling hook you'd use it to go to the bathroom, and everything else
[1:10:03] <%Mr_Strut> To be fair. If I had a grappling hook, I would find any excuse to use it.

[1:10:16] <TafferAA> piers pls
[1:10:18] <%ogtrashwizard> grappling hooks are fucking cool pat. wouldn't you use one every chance you get pat?
[1:10:19] <%rytyoung> Pan goes clink
[1:10:21] <%Dementedpenguin> Piers what the fuck are you doing
[1:10:22] <+griffball13> @PatStaresAt is there a reason that there armor is very bug like?
[1:10:22] <%SirGO0SE> need a brap wedding with Ada :(
[1:10:22] <%Drusain> if you had a grappling hook you'd use it too
[1:10:26] <%Frost_Quill> I'd do it if I had her stuff.
[1:10:27] <$vectorcannonready> I miss Dead Space.
[1:10:29] <$SmolBluGhost> they've yet to realize the costume change let alone the grapple hook hek
[1:10:30] <%srkAres> also... isnt that sniper scope the wrong way around?
[1:10:30] <%rytyoung> chop chop chop
[1:10:32] <%Deft_Thought> Deft_Thought subscribed with Twitch Prime. They've subscribed for 22 months, currently on a 18 month streak! Hey Pat. I'm sorry that people want to see you suffer through this game. I played through it with a friend a couple years back and just found it really uninteresting. Hope you've been havin a good week and thanks for the stream.
[1:10:39] <%rumtumtugnutz> I bet if you had a grapnel gun you'd zipline to the bathroom
[1:10:39] <%Frost_Quill> chop chop chop is getting louder.
[1:10:42] <%Mr_Strut> But are they residents?
[1:10:42] <TafferAA> who made the bug armor
[1:10:42] <takokasa> BUG evil
[1:10:43] <%heartlesshealer> They think Sparda was dope
[1:10:43] <%Shadicara> That's like asking why are they bugs
[1:10:44] <%the_vedo_show> makes sense atpCap
[1:10:45] <Solidnick18> choppa choppa

[1:10:49] <alwayspronking> 6!
[1:10:50] <Dragon_Batman> It's kinda been the theme of Chris campaign for some reason
[1:10:50] <%peachy996> I really appreciate Paige trying to overpower the loud RE6
[1:10:53] <Hellarussian> x8
[1:10:53] <ShichiNoBushi> Bugs = Evil (except for Kamen Rider)
[1:10:54] <ape_hawk> bugs are evil, thats why they are super-effective against dark types
[1:10:55] <+Karebuncle> piers is supposed to be the logical, catch every detail sniper guy and HE NEVER MENTIONS THE CLOTHES AHHHHH
[1:10:56] <%peachy996> It's a valiant effort
[1:10:57] <%xUmbraNinja> Boatman
[1:11:01] <EuropanLamprey> The virus morphed their armor to intimidate and find mates
[1:11:01] <+OhioNitsud> choppy chop intensifies
[1:11:02] <%Typhaeon> Another clown car of enemies appears
[1:11:02] <%Th3SmartAlec> So what's Neo-Umbrella's plan again?
[1:11:03] <CurrySauseBandit> That is some of the loudest chopping i've heard.
[1:11:04] <evbites> i hate boats in re so much
[1:11:04] <%krawtch> that guy fucking CHUNKED
[1:11:07] <AntChodeny> turns out the residents were evil this entire time
[1:11:07] <%Mr_Pylon> Wait, I've got it now. Ada isn't just Ada, she's been Alice'd and has dozens of clones that are woken up and given a death virus and do 1 job. New crazy prediction.
[1:11:09] <%logoth_> Bio Warriors

[1:11:38] <%the_vedo_show> LUL
[1:11:38] <%Th3SmartAlec> thanks boa
[1:11:39] <natebud> The RE7 boat is perfect on Madhouse weirdly enough. Everything else on that difficulty is fucked.

[1:11:39] <biomegabear> wha?
[1:11:40] <%krawtch> nice of him to slow down on top of the grenade

[1:32:41] <ScreamLord> @PatStaresAt RE6 released 5 months after Dragon's Dogma so that Not-El Gigante probably did use DD Cycoples animations

[1:32:56] <Shardlab> Apparently it's a product of the virus' engineering. The infected somehow don't kill each other, but go to feed on healthy victims
[1:32:57] <%ssjklyco> I just played Sherrys campaign. Jakes reaction to chris later still makes no sense.

[1:39:53] <%heartlesshealer> I'm on it!
[1:39:53] <maxamillion629> So is this a BP oil rig or what
[1:39:54] <%ironhoundgaming> evil
[1:39:56] <TonberryLives> Resident Evil 6: Evil Again
[1:39:59] <%krawtch> does every installation NEED to be staffed entirely with monsters
[1:40:02] <TafferAA> just pull open this hydraulic door 4Head
[1:40:05] <+StoicMoogle> High security blast door - Just pull that shit open
[1:40:08] <%Laecerelius> He got tiny arms!
[1:40:10] <%TheBitingIrish> @InugamiTheHound I still think ORC is worse than this
[1:40:16] <%heartlesshealer> yeah, it looked beetle-based, which is neat
[1:40:19] <%Th3SmartAlec> @krawtch Yeah, did these guys just transform or what?
[1:40:20] <+Brickhaus_> Boys I got no idea what's happening, are the soldier men fighting Gun Zombies?
[1:40:20] <%ssjklyco> Like where are the actual employees who have to do work to keep Umbrella facilities running?
[1:40:20] <rumad64> goddammit zombies with guns?
[1:40:25] <yourliteraldog> Fucking Beatle Borgs
[1:40:25] <%Conyst> @maxamillion629 nah BP is much more evil

[1:40:36] <%Laecerelius> Grub man gives no fucks about your flashbang!
[1:40:37] <+FrontLineFluffyBunny> there are still 2 more campaigns....
[1:40:37] <%Frost_Quill> So is Wesker the evil resident?
[1:40:40] <Jetsfantasy> Owch, nice shot
[1:40:41] <Hellarussian> that was almost cool
[1:40:42] <%TheBitingIrish> @InugamiTheHound Because half of the game is DLC, and the forced PvP parts
[1:40:46] <%bensonplayspokemon> psaBig splats
[1:40:48] <%Shadicara> and then you get giant grub men
[1:40:49] <biomegabear> FUCk why is in here
[1:40:55] <TafferAA> stag beetles now
[1:40:59] <natebud> This game has stuff, hidden deep within
[1:40:59] <Dragon_Batman> That's why Mercenaries is ok
[1:41:00] <suikudo> I still think this game is better than revelations 1
[1:41:02] <+linSP> yay but fuck
[1:41:04] <%heartlesshealer> yeah
[1:41:05] <%InugamiTheHound> @TheBitingIrish I've played re orc and I remember having a lot fun playing the game solo
[1:41:06] <%SWFanatic> must have been an accident
[1:41:09] <%Th3SmartAlec> ...
[1:41:09] <keatiestofthegribbles> man this yaoi doujin sucks
[1:41:11] <Hellarussian> oh
[1:41:12] <%krawtch> i will never get over how bad all of this music is
[1:41:12] <Slimeking_Mike> grub ball
[1:41:13] <%heartlesshealer> WHY
[1:41:13] <%ssjklyco> Quick shot is a good idea.
[1:41:18] <%ssjklyco> But the game is a bad idea
[1:41:18] <%xUmbraNinja> BLURGH
[1:41:19] <chicken_brotherr> you remember that time in Silent Hill 2 when James Sunderland went into an underwater Chinese bio weapon base, and punched a bunch of bugs? true survival horror right there
[1:41:21] <%Spiderfacev> yo gang
[1:41:23] <%Brickhaus_> @krawtch too true
[1:41:23] <%Verd_254> put that on the box "The game has moments of brilliance"
[1:41:25] <%Th3SmartAlec> @keatiestofthegribbles Yet the internet can't get enough of them
[1:41:26] <natebud> This game is far more entertaining than Rev1 @suikudo
[1:41:31] <Jetsfantasy> @keatiestofthegribbles Yeah, I should've noticed the insect tag... now I regret it
[1:41:31] <Wolfstriker121> my god this game
[1:41:34] <+linSP> the game has moment of brilliance
[1:41:36] <maxamillion629> these guys look like curse mark sasuke
[1:41:38] <%spiritofmojave> look at those grapplers
[1:41:40] <%blaccbird914> why is everything exploding
[1:41:40] <+tangoragahn> I wanna point out the entire car chase, boat and plane sequence was within the span of the Simmons train fight
[1:41:45] <%JJCheeker> Honestly those guys might as well be aliens
[1:41:51] <suikudo> I fell asleep twice watching you go thru rev1
[1:41:51] <%peachy996> Eh
[1:41:51] <+xenoriddley36> @PatStaresAt nemesis now chases you into save rooms in RE3 Remake! NOWHERE IS SAFE!!
[1:41:54] <+PanicSwytch> REV 1 IS BETTER
[1:41:54] <%Laecerelius> I think that Grub Men have done more work for you than fucking Piersbot over here
[1:41:58] <+lmybestfriendl> are these guys from soldier?
[1:41:58] <%Aracon_> at least the jill sections of rev 1 are decent
[1:41:59] <+dante_must_die_exe> big splosion
[1:42:01] <TafferAA> werent we already here
[1:42:01] <%peachy996> Consistent not in quality
[1:42:04] <%Aracon_> this game is just all bad
[1:42:05] <%xUmbraNinja> Both suck ass
[1:42:06] <%SilverSFS> Yeah, but this one is entertainging in an entirely different way.
[1:42:07] <%Th3SmartAlec> In Rev 1, at least you knew Jill sections were good
[1:42:08] <Slimeking_Mike> whee
[1:42:09] <RushUnplugged> rev1 is a bad RE game, this iss a BAD GAME
[1:42:09] <YaiGameworks> RE6 is literally one of the most uneven games I've ever played, it's all over the place in quality.
[1:42:11] <+sir_austinism> @xenoriddley36 That got missreported.
[1:42:11] <%InugamiTheHound> @PatStaresAt do you want RE8 to be FPS or TPS?
[1:42:11] <%Zaphire_Saucypants> Rev 1 is actually good in places
[1:42:12] <%Sir_stride> eh. I personally think this is better than rev 1
[1:42:14] <FstSergeant8595> Rev 1 is better, but they both suck ass
[1:42:15] <bsmusic> @xenoriddley36 That was disapproved by Capcom
[1:42:16] <natebud> That's why I didn't say better, but it is entertaining
[1:42:19] <Hellarussian> this makes CVX look like RE2
[1:42:19] <%spiritofmojave> Rev 1 somehow is despite everything, and that's... disappointing almost
[1:42:19] <TonberryLives> Yeah, but this game is at trying to make you feel something even if it fails LUL
[1:42:21] <+Irridium> Rev 1 at least doesn't last 40 god damn hours
[1:42:21] <Animorphimagi> Why bomb enemies tho?
[1:42:22] <+xenoriddley36> are you serious?!
[1:42:22] <FlyguyJP> BOOP
[1:42:23] <%Brickhaus_> Are these Grub Men hiding Leon's semen from Chris?

[1:42:41] <rumad64> weird bug things with guns and shields? this turnin into Dead Space?
[1:42:43] <%heartlesshealer> whichever as long as it's handled well
[1:42:43] <+xenoriddley36> dammit!!
[1:42:44] <%Aracon_> man the molded were real boring
[1:42:44] <TonberryLives> There's room for both
[1:42:45] <%trekkie11041> oh god this part
[1:42:46] <%realm_forge> So is Ada actually dead or are we dealing with more freaky clone bullshit?

[1:42:49] <tetraes> so whens RE4Remake? eh
[1:42:50] <+CptBritches> As long as they don't do a boat segment again
[1:42:50] <Zantetzuken> 3rd person when playing as jill
[1:42:51] <%Zaphire_Saucypants> If we go with Ethan, probably stick to 1st tho
[1:42:52] <biomegabear> RE8 is great
[1:42:54] <+xenoriddley36> molded were a horrible enemy
[1:42:56] <rytisone> it's gonna be RTS
[1:42:56] <%peachy996> The molded are very black evil
[1:42:58] <Jetsfantasy> They were lame , too generic looking
[1:42:58] <+linSP> yooo 2nd person would be dope for horror
[1:42:59] <%ssjklyco> You know Ada will be in 8 as per the rules of Resident Evil
[1:43:00] <%Th3SmartAlec> And a protagonist who has a vocabulary other than 'fuck'
[1:43:01] <+EkinRaider> yeah but the Baker family atpGasm
[1:43:01] <mankeytennis> 2nd person, we're the zambie
[1:43:02] <Animorphimagi> 3
[1:43:03] <%InugamiTheHound> Rev1 played a re game and it tried to be fun and campy
[1:43:04] <+tangoragahn> 3rd Person with crouch and 1st person toggle
[1:43:07] <ape_hawk> RE8 is gonna be a card game
[1:43:07] <natebud> That box has an airtube in it! WTF
[1:43:07] <maxamillion629> theyre defined by the plot wth
[1:43:09] <+FilthyHereticHorus> 7 was terrible
[1:43:10] <DracaenaLeaf> C+
[1:43:12] <%alexandrecau> plane, re is designed by planed
[1:43:12] <%trekkie11041> jack baker is the best
[1:43:13] <Hellarussian> 1st act was great
[1:43:14] <Neo_Kaiser> I hate this room
[1:43:14] <Dragon_Batman> There was only like 4 variants
[1:43:14] <%Shadicara> It can be first person if you play as Joe Baker
[1:43:16] <IminyourBase> the setting is your ass and the enemies are your asshole
[1:43:17] <%Aracon_> out in the bayou
[1:43:18] <%heartlesshealer> yeah
[1:43:19] <%xUmbraNinja> C
[1:43:19] <%Sir_stride> enemies was a solid C
[1:43:21] <%TheBitingIrish> BEE HIVE VAGINA WutFace
[1:43:21] <FlyguyJP> Molded are soggy bois
[1:43:22] <%BTRNDL> the game dragged on
[1:43:23] <xGeneralDOOM> jack was the best
[1:43:23] <%SWFanatic> welcome to the family son
[1:43:23] <chicken_brotherr> RE8 should be in 4D like Spy Kids 4 imo
[1:43:24] <Neo_Kaiser> I HATE THIS ROOM!
[1:43:25] <+SlumberMan> I'd say pacing before enemy design. Enemy design is #3.
[1:43:25] <%krawtch> you mean, is Ada dead or did she help Leon fight Simmons in a helicopter in about 20 minutes
[1:43:26] <+RenoDeGeneric> 7 had the worst final boss. 2 whole fat molded
[1:43:26] <rangriz> Bakers was great, Molded was D for me
[1:43:27] <%Aracon_> fighting with florida man
[1:43:28] <%peachy996> Setting and enemies in 6 suck ass
[1:43:29] <Captain_Krunk> RE 7 enemies being Baker family was great. Hated the stupid oily mold things
[1:43:29] <%G_Thunders> RE games should always just be in an isolated location for sure
[1:43:31] <Hellarussian> G A U N T L E T
[1:43:32] <%Th3SmartAlec> @ssjklyco And she'll sneak away again to sell a super virus and no one will care
[1:43:32] <Neo_Kaiser> This room always pisses me off
[1:43:32] <yourliteraldog> okay
[1:43:38] <Warbot40> Jack Baker for MVC
[1:43:39] <%Zaphire_Saucypants> oh yeah, this stupid part
[1:43:39] <nuane> are these ailiens
[1:43:40] <%Th3SmartAlec> STRANGER
[1:43:40] <%Jekado> so many timed segments
[1:43:40] <%JJCheeker> The enemy variety was pretty mediocre in seven
[1:43:41] <biomegabear> WHAT?
[1:43:41] <+callowbrodie> I'm on it
[1:43:41] <tiaramaki> STRANGA?
[1:43:41] <TonberryLives> Huh

[1:43:44] <+tangoragahn> The Bakers weee part of Simmons The Family
[1:43:44] <YaiGameworks> This rooms always a barrel of fun.
[1:43:44] <%Th3SmartAlec> WHAT ARE YA BUYING
[1:43:46] <rumad64> WHATAHWATHWAT!?
[1:43:47] <majindusto> The Molded were just Knockoff Regenerator from RE4
[1:43:48] <%peachy996> Oh they have different eyelight how nice
[1:43:48] <%Aracon_> ???????
[1:43:49] <+CptBritches> One of the main problems with RE7 is that the two main characters, Ethan and Mia, are basically just nothing
[1:43:49] <TheArrow_> I'm so happy that we've moved to a timeline where I'm not worried about every single thing Capcom does
[1:43:50] <+SpoonlessAlakazam> Do these dumbasses have PM-63s? LUL
[1:43:50] <yourliteraldog> Yeah that makes sense
[1:43:52] <%ssjklyco> This section sucks too

[1:45:25] <+jiggy_snipe> why did she record it like this? with a pause
[1:45:26] <%SWFanatic> how does the recording know you say Ada?

[1:45:39] <%Shady_Squid> Wait, so Ada is straight up evil now?
[1:45:39] <+SwarfegaHead> so could they just not decide if they wanted Ada to be a good or bad guy, so they made one of each in this?
[1:45:39] <tiaramaki> Just git gud 4Head
[1:45:40] <FlyguyJP> Stop being a poo-poo video game critic

[1:51:23] <%spiritofmojave> RAH
[1:51:23] <%YakumoYomi> It's probably a "I wanted to kill my dad" situation. He's lashing out because he can't lash out at Wesker himself. Probably.

[1:51:43] <%Frost_Quill> Does he not know who his dad is? Why won't they tell him?
[1:51:43] <%Zaphire_Saucypants> "What? I can't hear you!"

[1:51:50] <$KnivesEve> thanks cutscene i hate it
[1:51:50] <%Aracon_> there's no way Jake could've met wesker
[1:51:50] <maxamillion629> "What jake?"
[1:51:50] <%Dr_DangerPhD> Chris's face punched the bullet out of the way
[1:51:52] <%ironhoundgaming> storm trooper accuracy
[1:51:53] <%SWFanatic> There was NO Point to this scene
[1:51:54] <%ElkRiverDog> RE6: Drama!!!! Paige: hssssss chip chopchop
[1:51:54] <%Shadicara> Don't worry about it
[1:51:54] <FlyguyJP> ALL THESE EMOTIONS
[1:51:55] <JackalKing> This is the WORST dialogue Ive ever seen
[1:51:56] <%alexandrecau> maybe wesker he was a good dad
[1:51:57] <+Eddy21forsaken> no that's not important
[1:51:57] <+CapFlat> Also SHEVA! TALK ABOUT SHEVA YOU FUCKS
[1:51:58] <closetgremlin12> the man tried to destroy humanity
[1:51:58] <Hellarussian> shut up about the logistics
[1:51:59] <Mister_McDerp> EMOSHUNS
[1:52:00] <evbites> your dads a literal nazi
[1:52:01] <+MoonObscure> ResidentSleeper
[1:52:01] <+bob_zilla> i mean you can fuck your face up from just the air pressure..
[1:52:03] <%olwe123> its still his dad
[1:52:03] <Dragon_Batman> Not important enough for some reason
[1:52:03] <%tactician0> Its a Japanese thing pat you wouldn't understand
[1:52:06] <+PBandJensen> Part of Chris' ear would have probably blown off too
[1:52:06] <olaksi> they even make big deal about how his dad meant nothing to him
[1:52:06] <%heartlesshealer> BUT NAH
[1:52:07] <thelonechris> Your dad was into hentai
[1:52:07] <Solidnick18> hmmm
[1:52:08] <%espanishcanamurciana> mmm feed me mommy
[1:52:08] <snekUrgentPls> i mean who doesnt want a tentacle monster for a dad
[1:52:08] <natebud> I've seen IN BRUGES, I know what happens
[1:52:08] <%YourFavoriteShiba> HOW DARE YOU KILL ME GENOCIDAL FATHER?!?!?!
[1:52:09] <youlookokgetin> WHOS COOKING
[1:52:10] <Solidnick18> oh chli
[1:52:10] <TurtlesAndTentacles> Why wouldnt he? He wanted to know his father. If he's dead then he cant. doesnt matter he was a monster.
[1:52:10] <%xUmbraNinja> Because it‚Äôs his dad. Doesn‚Äôt matter if he met him or not. It‚Äôs his dad. Period.
[1:52:12] <%SoFarFetched> Im gonna assume everything Wesker did was kept secret from whoever Wesker was with.
[1:52:12] <Captain_Joe1911> TakeNRG i want some
[1:52:12] <%Niney_Who> Chili Good PogChamp
[1:52:12] <%peachy996> He could have ruined his hearing
[1:52:12] <lionandfox21> This is dumb as hell, Jake's motivation for this makes no sense since Wesker is a know bioterrorist
[1:52:13] <%Th3SmartAlec> 8.8/10
[1:52:13] <+Eddy21forsaken> its poison
[1:52:13] <kingbaconcrispy> I'm surprised Pierce didn't shoot him dead. Or kill Chris accidentally. Jake never met Wesker and hated him for being abandonned.
[1:52:14] <%Brickhaus_> Goddammit now I want Chili
[1:52:14] <%Razputin217> Is this a Japanese thing?
[1:52:14] <DesuDesuDokiDoki> salt

[1:52:17] <%TheMattman1313> "Yeah I killed your dad but I also punched a boulder so it was cool"
[1:52:17] <+Zerodyne90> it's alright :/
[1:52:17] <try_it_sis_> taste the chili
[1:52:18] <yourliteraldog> White people love chilli
[1:52:18] <%peachy996> HE SHOULD HAVE MADE HIM DEAF

[1:53:17] <%the_vedo_show> LMAOOOO
[1:53:17] <DesuDesuDokiDoki> yeah
[1:53:17] <%valriot> The tension cut him
[1:53:18] <Dragon_Batman> Yep
[1:53:18] <VizualBlitz> Yes but that Wesker bloodline should always hate the Redfield line, like the Hatfield and McCoy feud
[1:53:19] <nostalgiatron_> Yup LUL
[1:53:19] <olaksi> chris tightened his face muscles
[1:53:20] <%Aracon_> YUP

[1:53:24] <%misha_kastrilevich> fuck you piers

[1:53:25] <TwinBat> Chris ordered him tho
[1:53:25] <%the_vedo_show> Piers you bitch LMAO
[1:53:26] <%Drusain> thanks piers
[1:53:26] <%spiritofmojave> Piers doesn't care LUL
[1:53:26] <%foreverN2dust> god this game
[1:53:26] <+jiggy_snipe> well they need Jake alive
[1:53:26] <%ironhoundgaming> skull is a boulder
[1:53:26] <Solidnick18> LMAO
[1:53:27] <ScreamLord> @PatStaresAt At the very least Chris should be deaf in that ear
[1:53:27] <TonberryLives> IT WAS PERSONAL PAT COME ON
[1:53:28] <Dutchpotato> Yes piers would have killed him 100%
[1:53:29] <%vaporousTippler> Wow. Piers is a real monster.
[1:53:29] <natebud> Piers wanted to see where this was going
[1:53:29] <%SirGO0SE> well y eah piers is objectively dog shit
[1:53:30] <%Aracon_> Piers is such a dumbass
[1:53:30] <evbites> weskers escalation as a character is insane from corrupt cop to uber meinch
[1:53:31] <%krawtch> its a David Cage cutscene
[1:53:33] <%Dr_DangerPhD> Chris was protected by the forcefield of sexual tension
[1:53:33] <smig> Chris punched the bullet
[1:53:33] <+Pendragwn> @PatStaresAt but that would have been extra hype like the time they murdered wesker with rockets
[1:53:34] <%peachy996> All of this is stupid and I hate it
[1:53:35] <FlyguyJP> CURVED THE BULLET
[1:53:35] <tiaramaki> Thanks, Piers 4Head
[1:53:36] <%trekkie11041> re6 is the worst
[1:53:36] <suikudo> It was the tension that cut his face not the bullet
[1:53:37] <+SpoonlessAlakazam> Its more like the devs forgot LUL
[1:53:37] <rafaelba93> it was so close it would burn his self
[1:53:37] <Jolly_Adventurer> I honestly think Piers has been out of ammo this whole time and just pretending LUL
[1:53:38] <ovan20> NO TIME TO MAKE SENSE PAT rooD
[1:53:38] <TurtlesAndTentacles> -_-
[1:53:38] <%TheBitingIrish> It's those Redfield cheekbones, tough as steel
[1:53:38] <%peachy996> Fuck Capcom
[1:53:39] <Solidnick18> Piers did it for drama
[1:53:39] <+dante_must_die_exe> his CAPTAIN
[1:53:39] <+callowbrodie> Its fine
[1:53:40] <%tactician0> @PatStaresAt nah it wouldn't
[1:53:41] <zeroraider> Chris' cheek punched the bullet
[1:53:41] <%Jack_of_No_Trades> Piers has let you die every time youve beeen knocked down, he doesnt like you
[1:53:42] <thetruenicster> There's also the fact that Jake KNOWS Wesker tried to destroy the world and it pissed about it, so why?
[1:53:43] <biogenesisss> Yeah but the world tho
[1:53:44] <+Pendragwn> @PatStaresAt chris told him to do it
[1:53:44] <YaiGameworks> To be fair, Piers also just let you get pummeled at a door by monsters seconds before.
[1:53:45] <%peachy996> Who wrote this story?
[1:53:46] <+FrenchTact1cs> Irl the moment he drew, hed be done
[1:53:48] <Xodious987> well piers might have also remembered the whole antibodies thing. benefit of the doubt
[1:53:48] <%Zaphire_Saucypants> oh....
[1:53:49] <$SmolBluGhost> Chris's hearing is just as shot after that tf
[1:53:49] <natebud> he headbutted the bullet like Mask De Smith
[1:53:49] <DesuDesuDokiDoki> chris could hardbut the bullet
[1:53:49] <%Shadicara> Look at this fucking boss arena
[1:53:50] <%InugamiTheHound> got any tic tacs pills?
[1:53:50] <+Remery_> Piers is the worse sidekick in RE
[1:53:50] <%vectorless_peon> pat muzzel debris and the flash at that range would also probably blind Chris remember MGS3?
[1:53:50] <%spiritofmojave> Capcom forgot character motivations
[1:53:51] <%Zaphire_Saucypants> this place
[1:53:51] <%SirGO0SE> is the model scared now?
[1:53:51] <%doc_ock_rokc> @PatStaresAt Look pat, Chris has some kinks surounding his Ex...boss that he needs to work out
[1:53:51] <rytisone> Piers was following orders
[1:53:53] <%peachy996> Who wrote the script to this?
[1:53:54] <+SlumberMan> Piers REALLY wants that promotion.
[1:53:55] <%rumtumtugnutz> But Skyline chili isn't real chili
[1:53:55] <Pwgregory> Chris told him not to interfere. Its loyalty to allow your partner to get shot in the face.
[1:53:55] <+canabananilism> Don't forget that the muzzle flash would have burnt and deafened the fuck out of him too @PatStaresAt
[1:53:56] <%tank7013> Oh this is a fun room in raid mode
[1:53:56] <yourliteraldog> @rumtumtugnutz I see no difference in our two statements
[1:53:57] <+ItsYaGirlMaria> you gotta go press a button first
[1:53:58] <Hellarussian> Sharis Berries
[1:53:58] <FlyguyJP> Yeah Peirs didn't even flinch and shoot him
[1:54:01] <$WackyXmand> DMC5 is this game done right.
[1:54:03] <+StoicMoogle> It's like they didn't even write a script
[1:54:03] <+PBandJensen> I'm still wondering why Jake would give a shit at all
[1:54:03] <%heartlesshealer> sherry's too cool
[1:54:04] <%Frost_Quill> So does Jake not know what his dad did?
[1:54:06] <%Aracon_> if piers acted the way he was supposed to he would've murdered jake like the first second jake fired

[2:00:35] <maxamillion629> I thought the other missles were a distraction for the missles
[2:00:36] <+FrontLineFluffyBunny> thats right, we spent billions on a couple aircraft carriers as a distraction
[2:00:36] <%maskofmichael> This seems more of a Plan-B

[2:01:28] <+FrontLineFluffyBunny> cause nukes stoped existing
[2:01:29] <+lethallylactic> Doesn't it release the C-Virus?
[2:01:29] <Mister_McDerp> whats the point?
[2:01:31] <natebud> He just do
[2:01:31] <Hellarussian> oh hi
[2:01:33] <%maskofmichael> Godzilla
[2:01:33] <+bestcup> one monster is going to end the world but can also be taken down by 2 guys
[2:01:34] <%Dementedpenguin> Have you watched a Godzilla movie?
[2:01:35] <%doc_ock_rokc> @Shadowpint Infects the sea?
[2:01:35] <EuropanLamprey> It's a really, really big monster
[2:01:35] <Graxe_> The plan was to release the C-Virus with this thing throughout the oceans
[2:01:37] <YaiGameworks> This is the baby form of the monster, basically once it hits the ocean it multiplies and drains the whole ocean from Earth.
[2:01:38] <%Aracon_> they could drop a nuke on this thing and itt'd be done in seconds
[2:01:39] <%heartlesshealer> maybe when it matures it shoots out infection clouds????
[2:01:40] <%Th3SmartAlec> DID IT JUST GET STUCK
[2:01:41] <%xUmbraNinja> BLURGH
[2:01:41] <%honeyman18> I should infect a radius around it for miles
[2:01:43] <%tank7013> I think the lore is that HAOS hatched early
[2:01:43] <TungstenViper> EXACTLY
[2:01:48] <+dante_must_die_exe> seems pretty susceptible to GUN
[2:01:48] <%TheBitingIrish> @Shadowpint IKR? It looks like it would be liquefied after a tank shell or two
[2:01:50] <%trekkie11041> @Shadowpint it can release the same blue gas but it woke up early
[2:01:50] <Captain_Krunk> Nah, that transformed William Birkin could have been far more devastating
[2:01:50] <ha2ken> Defeat this Kaiju....EDF EDF EDF!
[2:01:51] <+Skelegroove> What is this arena even supposed to be?
[2:01:52] <Graxe_> Yeah, they hatched it early

[2:01:55] <%peachy996> Even Mass Effect 2 said their big monster was unfinished
[2:01:56] <CraZ80> this reminds me of that Spider-Man game where you run away from Carnage at the end. what was the name of that game again?

[2:16:41] <%espanishcanamurciana> look at piers arm
[2:16:41] <%Muzzle131> @PatStaresAt Pat Chris just stopped a pressure head door capable of stopping the weight of ocean and you think that Chris's melee attacks won't be stronger than a gun?
[2:16:44] <KingSpunf> Guess I'll die
[2:16:44] <%ironhoundgaming> knife*
[2:16:45] <+Shindeil> As scripted as this boss fight is when you figure it out, there's still little hit registration, so you're not sure you're doing the right thing until you see the stab prompt.
[2:16:46] <natebud> The answer is wait for Piers to do something right for once
[2:16:47] <RushUnplugged> why would you think you can use guns in an RE game Pat, silly you
[2:16:48] <olaksi> you have to figure it out immediately somehow
[2:16:48] <FlyguyJP> Guess you should just die
[2:16:51] <+MrAtheGreat> I guess you‚Äôll just die.
[2:16:52] <dukenux> punch it like its a fleshy boulder

[2:17:11] <NeoRageX456> I'm sure it drops ammo when it shoots stuff on the water or the ceiling
[2:17:12] <ExpressNode> I would just die so I could get all my wasted ammo back
[2:17:12] <Hellarussian> just a piece
[2:17:12] <%Shadicara> LMAO
[2:17:14] <%Zaphire_Saucypants> wow
[2:17:15] <%krawtch> Chris can have a little ammo
[2:17:15] <%ssjklyco> His vomit is supposed to drop ammo The problem though is it barely drops ammo so it's borderline impossible.

[2:22:52] <%CygnusRoboticus> CygnusRoboticus subscribed at Tier 1. They've subscribed for 4 months! Piers juicing up for justice is the only thing I liked in Chris' entire campaign, it makes me want to see one of the ouroboros-compatible genetic freaks show up as a BSAA member styling on BOWs.

[2:22:52] <%zenraider> he better die

[2:29:59] <FlyguyJP> I can already feel myself getting cut by Jake's edge
[2:30:00] <%spiritofmojave> Jake straight up is a good successor to Wesker and Sherry to William, it's pretty good but doesn't salavage the other plot bs
[2:30:01] <%krawtch> that chapter where Jake blows that dude is super unsettling
[2:30:01] <+Shindeil> Anyone else in here entertained enough by this game to have done multiple playthroughs of it on 360, PS3, and PC? Or just me?

[2:30:14] <%GalacticaPhanto> There is. it's the Ada chapter
[2:30:14] <YaiGameworks> On one hand, Jake has the best boss fight in RE6 and my personal favorite chapter in the game (Chapter 3). On the other hand, Jake has his Chapter 2....
[2:30:16] <%zenraider> pat should use cheats for these next parts if there are any

[2:36:37] <ShichiNoBushi> Replace the giant spiders with horrific spider-like human abominations.
[2:36:38] <%OrganoidZero> cheer500 In your opinion is this or DMC 2 worse. To me DMC 2 is and I assume you feel the same way since you won't play that but are suffering through this lol.
[2:36:40] <FlyguyJP> Cats better than dogs
[2:36:43] <$SpeakingToYourSkeletons> PogChamp100
[2:36:49] <cham52> DMC2 is waaaaay worse
[2:36:56] <%Meekest> no
[2:36:59] <%xxshadowxx416> yes
[2:37:00] <DesuDesuDokiDoki> BIO SECURITY BOIS
[2:37:00] <%D3rrtyD4n> yes
[2:37:02] <RushUnplugged> we don't actually see Piers die so he's 100% ok and will be back for re8
[2:37:03] <thelonechris> Yes
[2:37:11] <%SirGO0SE> krauser campaign when
[2:37:13] <lionandfox21> I mean you have 1k people so i think its worth it pat
[2:37:17] <DSD24> Mercs is really fun though!
[2:37:23] <%Roundelay11> now?
[2:37:26] <%nosubstancex> :D lol
[2:37:27] <%krawtch> RE6 constantly demands you participate in its horrible action
[2:37:28] <SainEdge> @OrganoidZero DMC2 is worse, but also much shorter LUL
[2:37:31] <%Erimos> Mercs is widely considered to be fun, so there must not be THAT much mechanical roughness.
[2:37:33] <tiaramaki> DEE EM CEE TOO
[2:37:34] <stormhawk9891> @OrganoidZero RE6 at least has fun gunplay
[2:37:36] <%nosubstancex> raikamPika

[2:37:43] <cham52> PLAY DEE EM CEE TUUU
[2:37:44] <%Verd_254> Verd_254 subscribed with Twitch Prime. They've subscribed for 18 months! I nearly tripled my money in FF14 thanks in part to your gathering/crafting stream. Thanks, buddy.
[2:37:45] <%xxshadowxx416> Lucia
[2:37:45] <ha2ken> Speaking of,DMC
[2:37:46] <+griffball13> DMC 2 is just shoot till dead
[2:37:47] <%shadow1man9> BOOTI PLZ
[2:37:47] <%krawtch> DMC2 at least introduced concepts and ideas that would be better used later in 3
[2:37:47] <KingSpunf> DONTI IS GUUD
[2:37:48] <DSD24> Dante's design is cool
[2:37:49] <Captain_Krunk> DMC 2 Guns = auto win
[2:37:49] <%Fatmanjoggin> there are TWO good bosses in dmc2
[2:37:50] <@ShockzNDrawe> it's quick and easy
[2:37:50] <%Valentinius_Anodyne> At least this has Piers with his rad lightning arm
[2:37:51] <+FrenchTact1cs> also Lucia

[2:37:59] <%Zaphire_Saucypants> as did I
[2:38:00] <rytisone> don't forget Lucia disk
[2:38:02] <%SoFarFetched> Too bad they only had 2 games LUL
[2:38:02] <biomegabear> dead space was RE4 space
[2:38:03] <maxamillion629> Dead space is great
[2:38:04] <j0ustar> I miss dead space so much
[2:38:05] <FlyguyJP> Visceral Why
[2:38:05] <%peachy996> Dead Space franchise ended at 2
[2:38:07] <SMuffinMan> DMC2 barely exists
[2:38:07] <codycurry52> Dante movement is really good
[2:38:08] <ha2ken> I heard some DMC sound effects in this game
[2:38:10] <omegadarknes> rip, i missed the stream when i stepped out of the house for a bit
[2:38:12] <%Zaphire_Saucypants> Dead space was pretty fuckin great
[2:38:13] <DracaenaLeaf> dead space 3 tho
[2:38:15] <%Ner234> FeelsBadMan
[2:38:15] <%D3rrtyD4n> LOL
[2:38:17] <%Drusain> devil may cry, too
[2:38:18] <TafferAA> D:
[2:38:19] <Neo_Kaiser> Dead Space was what Resident Evil 5 should have been.
[2:38:19] <%Jekado> like why
[2:38:20] <%peachy996> Much like Mass Effect franchise
[2:38:21] <+jiggy_snipe> LUL
[2:38:21] <%Aleate> Aww ruuCry
[2:38:23] <cham52> pls come to my house
[2:38:25] <%Jekado> he wouldn't want to come over anymore
[2:38:26] <%Dementedpenguin> That's sweet, Pat
[2:38:28] <%SoFarFetched> Only close friends make their f riends suffer
[2:38:29] <%Aracon_> that would be fun
[2:38:32] <Uselesswhitenoise> play re 6 with me
[2:38:33] <%axellogic> I like cooking too

[2:38:35] <+Vantesla> cohhL
[2:38:36] <%poohtrailsnailcooch> I'm I guess I'm in the minority think that dead space 3 was alright
[2:38:37] <%Shadowpint> ME3 and Dead SPace 3 were good
[2:38:38] <j0ustar> Dead space is great but DS3 is a boring slog
[2:38:40] <ShichiNoBushi> I'm imagining him.
[2:38:41] <ckbooks> I just realised I had this stream muted for all of RE6 and only now that it's over am I intently watching again.
[2:38:41] <%corepercentlives> dead space 3 is much better ds game than re6 is re game
[2:38:41] <%trustycoyote> LUL
[2:38:41] <+BubbaRands> Come be my maid! 4Head

[2:44:07] <%chiluzza> hahahaha what
[2:44:07] <FlyguyJP> Why even shoot? Just go
[2:44:10] <%sjay449> Thematically the idea of the kids of Wesker and Birkin fighting Bio-terror is cool... then you realize this is RE6
[2:44:12] <%GabeSweetMan> WHAT COULD IT BE REFERENCING?
[2:44:12] <Jetsfantasy> Doesn't Sherry have some sort of healing factor now? That idea is super cool

[2:45:05] <%D3rrtyD4n> ok, but whats actually useful
[2:45:05] <DatAsuna> sherry has stun rod combos tho
[2:45:06] <chicken_brotherr> Ada may be a genocidal maniac in this game, but she is also extremely attractive, so it is impossible to tell if she is truly good or bad
[2:45:06] <zeroraider> Where did he get a life meter app?
[2:45:06] <%GabeSweetMan> EQUIP HANDS
[2:45:07] <%Jekado> that uses a lot of stamina
[2:45:07] <%krawtch> what if you shot the gun tho
[2:45:07] <+deadassnoble> Virtua Fighter much?
[2:45:07] <olaksi> ok, not as good as sherry though
[2:45:08] <%poohtrailsnailcooch> people love bausch shit

[2:45:43] <%ssjklyco> You have stamina ammo though
[2:45:43] <%Shadicara> Do a karate run
[2:45:44] <DatAsuna> sherry's stun rod is stronger tho
[2:45:45] <Mister_McDerp> FIGHTING GAME
[2:45:45] <%SirGO0SE> no gun run
[2:45:45] <+AcrutaLao> But what if enemy was an attack chopper?
[2:45:50] <cham52> did Wesker fuck Juri
[2:45:50] <%Erimos> Jake is most fun, mechanically.
[2:45:53] <%Run44forrest> using that hand to hand shit gave me a headache
[2:45:53] <+FrenchTact1cs> Who didnt he fuck?

[3:03:23] <%Shadicara> boss barrels
[3:03:23] <%wingblade7> just get chased by helicopter and zombie hulk, better call the BUILDING inspector!
[3:03:26] <+Skelegroove> Are all of Jake's Missions just walking through empty rooms?
[3:03:29] <codycurry52> What an amazing environment!
[3:03:30] <%G_Thunders> At least Jake seems to be aware of how stupid this all is
[3:03:30] <biomegabear> I WONDER IF WE'RE GONNA COME BACK HERE

[3:03:54] <%GabeSweetMan> Elephant Gun >>>> Elephant "Killer"
[3:03:55] <%king_wragles> Why is Jake stuck in this awful game?
[3:03:56] <%Shadowpint> Why are the melee finishers so finicky this session
[3:03:57] <SparkAfterDark> Hmm you can kill everyone so far with your bare hands I wonder why they gave you a magnum?
[3:04:01] <rytisone> now you can defeat zoo level in RE Outbreak 2
[3:04:02] <+Pyroclase> Unfortunately it only kills elephants, not zombies
[3:04:03] <startstoprepeat> i can't believe they spoiled the elephant boss fight with the name of that gun
[3:04:03] <%FlyguyJP> The Scent of Boss Fight
[3:04:04] <%peachy996> Did he say Lesbian?
[3:04:08] <AntChodeny> Jake just fucks off. I only know this because I walked in on a friend unlocking the end cut scene

[3:04:17] <Mister_McDerp> why is Jake so cool?

[3:08:43] <CrimsonFox777> What even was this building and why did it have so many explosive barrels?
[3:08:46] <%GabeSweetMan> Wesker would never sully himself with carnal pleasures of the flesh. Obviously he used the far superior method of syringe injection on unsuspecting womanfolk.
[3:08:52] <%spiritofmojave> Barret is still the best boi

[3:09:07] <KeiPrime> err sherry not melee

[3:09:33] <KeiPrime> nice dodge
[3:09:36] <+griffball13> that was cool

[3:10:18] <%peachy996> Oh god it's Wesker's dumb Re5 kick

[3:10:31] <+DoctorDerp388> the ol runaround
[3:10:31] <%Bane_Kaikyo> RIPCheer507 Ok so, at the beginning I was sure RE6 was at least mechanically fun to play.... The more I watch, the more I see it's problems and realize I REALLY WAS seeing it through rose tinted eyeballs because I played it with my cousin and we goofed around and shit. Anyways, enjoy Jake and his Geneticly inherited kung-fu..... PS: When we played through this campaign, We called the Nemmy Rip-off "Sven". We needed to call him SOMETHING and he just kinda looked like a "Sven" :)

[3:14:25] <Shardlab> If THIS was Resident Evil, I'd play this
[3:14:27] <%Literal___Nobody> Why doesn't Sherry have cool powers like Jake?
[3:14:27] <%FlyguyJP> @Th3SmartAlec All the mercs injected themselves with the virus at the same time. Jake was unaffected
[3:14:30] <codycurry52> It's Jakes BLOOD
[3:14:30] <natebud> which nation?
[3:14:31] <%honeyman18> So the C-virus won't be cured till somone pays Jake?

[3:15:15] <%miguelrod777> high stakes sexual tension
[3:15:16] <SlappyMeats> Shake and Jerry are both bonafide superheroes, naturally they're more fun to play

[3:17:11] <%peachy996> What a loser
[3:17:11] <SwindlerOfProgress> Uh
[3:17:13] <SlappyMeats> Remember how Rev1 sucked because of having to do the same shitty Hunter section over and over and over again? How about that, but MORE of it for RE6?
[3:17:16] <%Aleate> So when I was doing this sequence with my friend, I ended up killing both of the Giants because I wanted the points. Oops.
[3:17:17] <natebud> he forgot again
[3:17:19] <%GabeSweetMan> phew
[3:17:19] <%FlyguyJP> Stupid video game things

[3:17:41] <+FrenchTact1cs> BibleThump

[3:17:47] <%xUmbraNinja> Mmmm me
[3:17:48] <%SWFanatic> @s1rcuit fair
[3:17:54] <%peachy996> @CloniiCory The only success were the Hunters
[3:17:54] <TheSkeep> yep
[3:17:56] <%heartlesshealer> Yup
[3:18:00] <%GabeSweetMan> Thanks Game. We hate it.
[3:18:03] <%spiritofmojave> it's the exact same really
[3:18:03] <%Erimos> The BOWs don't know how to deal with such overwhelming confidence.
[3:18:04] <RushUnplugged> Jake has superpowers but does the exact same things Chris did
[3:18:07] <%honeyman18> He looks like a fleshy Mineta with the daiper outfit.
[3:18:07] <biomegabear> But easier
[3:18:10] <+DoctorDerp388> HOBO
[3:18:12] <%peachy996> Oh this dumbass didn't learn from the first time
[3:18:12] <rytisone> is this the zapping system?
[3:18:14] <%SWFanatic> "He's for lunch!"
[3:18:18] <%Aracon_> that was goofy
[3:18:19] <SwindlerOfProgress> Hell yeah we did
[3:18:20] <natebud> i see
[3:18:21] <+Pyroclase> these are SUPPOSED to cross over with other people playing the other campaigns, but obviously it only worked on like launch day.
[3:18:24] <%TheBitingIrish> DansGame
[3:18:27] <%MrBorisMakarov> don't worry about it
[3:18:32] <rxspicychicken> He was a skater boy, said see you later boy
[3:18:33] <+DoctorDerp388> It's the lunchay
[3:18:34] <%maskofmichael> A little bit
[3:18:35] <+Blargimazombie> JAke Wesker Pro Skater
[3:18:36] <%Jekado> yeah i think he was skating in the begining too
[3:18:36] <%spiritofmojave> look we did Chris' chapter but slightly faster with neat powers
[3:18:40] <maxamillion629> Im glad spider-man is here to help
[3:18:45] <%tank7013> So canonically shouldn't Wesker have been completely clean when Jake would have been conceived? Why is he superhuman?
[3:18:46] <SlappyMeats> what, you mean you didn't get enough of Chris' campaign in Chris' campaign?
[3:18:46] <%doc_ock_rokc> @Pyroclase the Cameo system?
[3:18:50] <+skeletiddy> why does he have a big, juicy weakpoint? what is that even for?
[3:18:50] <Shardlab> So, the DMCV thing
[3:18:51] <+Pyroclase> ye
[3:18:55] <KeiPrime> SMELL THAT AIR
[3:18:59] <%heartlesshealer> yeah
[3:18:59] <%peachy996> At least the music is less obnoxious
[3:19:00] <%Aracon_> I hope jake gets to fight a dinosaur just like leon
[3:19:00] <%Nope80808> Is Jake Just Eric Sparrow?
[3:19:04] <%poohtrailsnailcooch> I need one more line to finish this
[3:19:05] <RushUnplugged> CHRIS MUST SHOOT GUN
[3:19:05] <Mister_McDerp> are those soviet flags?
[3:19:06] <+Andrizzleton> The snipers tho
[3:19:08] <%GabeSweetMan> Chris has an enemy generation field.
[3:19:09] <%FlyguyJP> Chris is the army dude. He's the shotanger
[3:19:09] <CloniiCory> @peachy996 I'd argue the concept wasn't even genuinely combat ready until Degenerations psychic Licker control tbh. But even then the wielder has a limited time before the zombie virus takes over.
[3:19:14] <ThatOneGuyYouSaw> @Pyroclase I crossed over once on ps3 like 2 years ago; Ada and Jake
[3:19:14] <+Skelegroove> Jake is the walking section
[3:19:21] <Dragon_Batman> I think it's a bit too early for the enemies to be here
[3:19:23] <TheSkeep> DMC5 had the smarter idea of just recording players rather then try to matchmake you
[3:19:25] <%SWFanatic> clomp clomp
[3:19:27] <Neo_Kaiser> Eric Sparrow is Pats favourite character.
[3:19:28] <%TheBitingIrish> @tank7013 He was always super human
[3:19:30] <ajgilmore1> Jake Stranding
[3:19:32] <ThatOneGuyYouSaw> once
[3:19:36] <+FrenchTact1cs> nice
[3:19:38] <+Pyroclase> @ThatOneGuyYouSaw I don't even remember Jake and Ada sharing a level
[3:19:39] <%Aracon_> uuhhhhh
[3:19:39] <%Erimos> Well done
[3:19:40] <natebud> shoulda thought it through
[3:19:40] <%peachy996> Three times? What a smart BOW
[3:19:41] <+soullesskin> The running camera bothers me....
[3:19:42] <%FlyguyJP> Pat only NOW thinks of that
[3:19:43] <KeiPrime> well done
[3:19:45] <+Andrizzleton> it isn't time

[3:20:13] <+StoicMoogle> I just looked away for a sec, why are you fighting a kaiju?
[3:20:13] <%wingblade7> this game is very not on the good side of things
[3:20:14] <sexy_tora> melee him Kappa
[3:20:15] <ThatOneGuyYouSaw> @Pyroclase Ada snipes enemies while Jake and Sherry are completely unaware of her presence. it was quite fitting actually
[3:20:15] <%nmaten> good job

[3:22:49] <%Jekado> GAMEPLAY COMENCE!
[3:22:50] <%xUmbraNinja> What a revelation
[3:22:51] <CloniiCory> Jake wins by doing nothing.
[3:22:52] <%Zaphire_Saucypants> it's different music, but equally terrible.
[3:22:54] <%DedlokPM> is this a case of "winning without doing anything"
[3:22:54] <%CrowbarFacelift> hey we got a video game here
[3:22:55] <%tank7013> @TheBitingIrish ...Oh shit that's right the whole Wesker children project. I completely forgot about that

[3:23:44] <Mister_McDerp> god thing sherry is immortal
[3:23:44] <+SH1NK1R0> Is that fart gas? Or is the road extra dusty?

[3:23:49] <Wolfstriker121> RESIDENT EVIL RUNNING
[3:23:49] <+NitronStreams> Sherry will fight it HEAD ON!
[3:23:51] <+Keiyum> I feel like this game is just accurate to what it would be like fighting a giant nasty person. Just kind of slow and he's not really doing much?
[3:23:51] <Shardlab> wow
[3:23:51] <%SinisterWang> Sherry's a tough old broad
[3:23:57] <%spiritofmojave> The same thing

[3:24:44] <%spiritofmojave> Forgot how goofy that lunge was
[3:24:46] <%Erimos> This feels like a multiplayer map.

[3:26:58] <%tank7013> @sappinmahbinyot And all he had to do was get super butthurt about Wesker and hit the gym really hard
[3:26:59] <+luketrapwalker> It feels like something completely different.
[3:26:59] <%MrBorisMakarov> atpBigot

[3:27:37] <%goose_attack_almanac> Meuler
[3:27:37] <+Pyroclase> this is easily the stupidest part of the game coming up
[3:27:39] <Mister_McDerp> meuller
[3:27:41] <%tank7013> @sappinmahbinyot Maybe one day you too can punch a boulder in a volcano
[3:27:41] <%Admiral_PopnFresh> Is it bad that I like the Melee in this game?
[3:27:41] <Dutchpotato> @ it‚Äôs a real mystery Kappa
[3:27:41] <%GabeSweetMan> Muller??
[3:27:42] <+vicar_anat> RE6 is fun if you turn your brainnnnnnnnnnnnnn off
[3:27:42] <%spiritofmojave> Muller
[3:27:44] <%spiritofmojave> LUL
[3:27:45] <%Jack_of_No_Trades> thats all? sure

[3:27:50] <%tsatoma> Muller sounds very Edonian
[3:27:51] <dalishprince> "tell him he can stick it"
[3:27:52] <Dr_Mooose> only 50 million
[3:27:53] <sappinmahbinyot> @tank7013 now thats some motivation
[3:27:54] <sexy_tora> atpGasm re6
[3:27:54] <Dutchpotato> @savagedeviljayho it‚Äôs a real mystery Kappa
[3:27:56] <Shardlab> I can hear him laughing through the line
[3:27:57] <%peachy996> Tell him to suck an egg
[3:28:00] <%xUmbraNinja> @Th3SmartAlec why would he?
[3:28:00] <+DoctorDerp388> atpGasm
[3:28:01] <rytisone> LIES
[3:28:01] <%bubblebasspickles> like 3 days in Iraq
[3:28:01] <Dr_Mooose> chump change
[3:28:02] <gamezerox> It's pretty cheap
[3:28:02] <natebud> @vicar_anat It's way more fun if you think hard about every little thing
[3:28:03] <%SWFanatic> they said they'll get you a mcgriddle
[3:28:04] <%Aracon_> seriously sherry
[3:28:05] <%Keyd00d> ez
[3:28:08] <+tangoragahn> Doesn't Sherry work for Simmons
[3:28:08] <%Scottigecko> this game is doing sanity damage to pat over time and you can see it
[3:28:09] <CloniiCory> RE6 is good if you just look at the Sherry and Helena hentai.
[3:28:09] <+UnpronounceableName> PogChamp ez 50 mil
[3:28:11] <%Alpha8087> Oh I see I showed up in time for another part of RE6
[3:28:12] <%SirGO0SE> haha money alright
[3:28:12] <%JJCheeker> You should've asked for 500miill
[3:28:13] <+Troispoint> RE 6 looks like the fake video game in a movie
[3:28:14] <%SoFarFetched> bet they were like "Fifty mill is chump change"
[3:28:14] <ajgilmore1> Is Sherry's employer Vince McMahon?
[3:28:16] <cheesedburgers> Jake seems like legally distinct Nero
[3:28:17] <%FlyguyJP> And then they black bag Jake and suck out his blood
[3:28:17] <%Keyd00d> do dodooo
[3:28:18] <%peachy996> Stick him Sherry
[3:28:18] <Monkeyweed21> thats not how patches work
[3:28:20] <%tank7013> 50 mil is honestly probably jack shit to them
[3:28:22] <%Alpha8087> Also I am apparently a choo choo train
[3:28:23] <%goose_attack_almanac> I feel like Resident Evil doesn't understand money
[3:28:24] <%peachy996> Stick im right now
[3:28:24] <+mmack093> So who did Whesker fuck?
[3:28:27] <%GabeSweetMan> The one you never met?
[3:28:27] <%Th3SmartAlec> @natebud @xUmbraNinja Albert Wesker almost ended the world, and was killed by Chris Redfield. I would think his son would know that....unless. He doesn;t know he's Wesker's son
[3:28:29] <%Literal___Nobody> 50 Mil is nothing to the US government
[3:28:30] <+tangoragahn> Couldn't he just pay Jake to fuck off
[3:28:31] <%Aracon_> shoot him and then put him on ice, make this mission 10x easier
[3:28:32] <%sleepy_coffee> What would happen if jake said that he was whiskers son
[3:28:33] <%the_vedo_show> he's hot
[3:28:34] <cheezbass> god i am getting cut by jakes edge so hard
[3:28:35] <usurper_sos> ????

[3:28:38] <+FrenchTact1cs> Anime
[3:28:39] <%DesuDesuDokiDoki> saving the world is worth 50 mil
[3:28:40] <%peachy996> I want to kill him for some reason
[3:28:40] <+skeletiddy> he wants his number
[3:28:41] <goddamndavid> how old is Chris in this game?

[3:28:52] <+BionoidLCR> @goddamndavid yes
[3:28:52] <%xxshadowxx416> in the blood
[3:28:53] <YaiGameworks> Time for the stupidest boss fight of the game
[3:28:55] <%krawtch> how do we keep a plot point in suspense you guyyyys
[3:28:56] <%GabeSweetMan> @mmack093 We've discussed this. He used a syringe. Wesker would NEVER lower himself to the carnal pleasures of flesh.
[3:28:56] <natebud> @Th3SmartAlec Maybe it wasn't well publicized
[3:28:57] <%bevyrage> in all honesty, RE6 pretty much just is a whole lot of buildup from nothing to nothing
[3:28:57] <%FlyguyJP> So... the pilots not gonna talk?
[3:28:59] <gade177> I hate it when people do that.
[3:29:00] <Captain_Krunk> He remembered, there was no time to explain again LUL
[3:29:02] <sappinmahbinyot> why does Jake look so fucking boring ugh why did they make him bald?

[3:31:03] <YaiGameworks> Imagine if a Chopper pilot just yelled at you to jump to the next chopper and full speed multiple meters away
[3:31:03] <Heyestus> This feels like it was initially written to be on a train.
[3:31:03] <%SirGO0SE> BREAKING NEW GROUND
[3:31:04] <+UnpronounceableName> are you ready for more exciting gameplay?
[3:31:10] <s1rcuit> IT COULD JUST LAND
[3:31:11] <Neo_Kaiser> Why doesn't the pilot chopper just pull away?
[3:31:13] <+skeletiddy> is he CONTROLLING THE COPTER?
[3:31:16] <%FlyguyJP> If they want Jake alive to get his blood they are doing a TERRIBLE job
[3:31:16] <%Aracon_> I'm losing my mind at this
[3:31:17] <Captain_Krunk> Real fucking help guys, thanks
[3:31:19] <%Zaphire_Saucypants> But discount Nemesis identifies as an Apache Helicopter, Pat. Let the boi dream.

[3:31:39] <ThatOneGuyYouSaw> I remember reading a theory that this guy was Leon.
[3:31:39] <YaiGameworks> I can't believe all the Choppers in RE6 teamed up with Ustanak.
[3:31:41] <%GabeSweetMan> MURDER PILOT
[3:31:43] <ajgilmore1> This game is a gift
