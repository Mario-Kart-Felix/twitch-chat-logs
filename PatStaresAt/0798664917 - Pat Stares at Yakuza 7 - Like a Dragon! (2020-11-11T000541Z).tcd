I think it shows off a key part of Asuka's personality. She spends the whole episode bitching about every little thing, but when she's about to die, she's just like "Oh well." She'd rather die than look uncool.

[2:00:09] <reonome> its drug magic shut up
[2:00:10] <+MacBeyer> how the hell is he walking though, dude's been a wheelchair forever
[2:00:10] <KaironFortressKnight> "Doc, it's been over four hours..." "Nice."
[2:00:10] <Louie_Salmon> He might be doing therapy as well
[2:00:10] <Solidnick18> can you walk tho?
[2:00:12] <ManfredA> NOT ADRENALINE
[2:00:13] <RetributionP> they gotta bleed your dick
[2:00:14] <Blank9> wouldn't everyone think he faked the wheelchair thing, after this?
[2:00:14] <%Darren716> He may still be able to walk just not much
[2:00:15] <%GiantRatThatMakesTheRulz> he just learned to walk no problem huh?
[2:00:18] <$Nobody404> He shouldn't still have good enough motor control to immediately start walking regardless
[2:00:19] <skyentombment> COME TO ME WOMEN
[2:00:19] <NaderShahDidNothingWrong> How does he have the reflextes to walk. You have to learn that
[2:00:19] <ManfredA> E-PHED-RINE
[2:00:20] <%GeneralSCPatton> I think if a boner lasts that long, the blood starts to congeal and the problem can no longer solve itself
[2:00:20] <%YakumoYomi> EPHEDRINE, PAT
[2:00:21] <+FleshFriend> He's got a WIDE stance to show off that boner
[2:00:21] <Not_Dutch_> the hardest of criminals
[2:00:21] <+MordoPrime> did he injected some bane´s venom on his penis?
[2:00:24] <%KineKithZen> So dumb that it has to be "epinephrine" in the US because of stupid copyright shit
[2:00:25] <DashXero> Oh he's screwed.
[2:00:25] <FoolproofDread> shouldn't he be all wobbly from lack of practice?
[2:00:26] <+HefestoForges> where's AIKA tho
[2:00:26] <%furiousfurioso> we don't know if he's paralyzed or if he just doesnt usually have the strength to walk
[2:00:28] <Hellarussian> hes not having it
[2:00:28] <%Starotter70> Just like that
[2:00:28] <%PaladinDupre> SHES GONE!
[2:00:29] <%linSP> DRUGS
[2:00:29] <%Zeikier> unless he had physical therapy? not sure
[2:00:30] <CurrySauseBandit> Which he isn't worried about if he'll never walk afterwards
[2:00:31] <AmericanaRed> BITCHES LOVE ME
[2:00:32] <%ssjklyco> It will make no sense later
[2:00:33] <Louie_Salmon> Considering he's rich, he probably has a personal trainer helping moving his body
[2:00:33] <Mr_Strut> This guy took danger drugs to simp on a hostess better
[2:00:34] <EddieDalmunda> That's the plan
[2:00:34] <%bread_assassin> I'm guessing he can walk short distances.
[2:00:36] <%Pookiedaexzile> Uh oh
[2:00:36] <%Piemono> Is he gonna kill someone with his boner?
[2:00:38] <%ShinobiPhoenix> litearlly can't feel a thing...
[2:00:38] <+TheBitingIrish> Why does it sound like they're in a cavern
[2:00:39] <fuji_92> yall dont know if hes paralyzed, he could just have weak legs
[2:00:39] <BooitsDock> oh
[2:00:40] <+trashcansan> depending on his legs, he could probably just do water therapy to stop the atrophy
[2:00:40] <+Ancopro> oh god
[2:00:41] <Solidnick18> yep
[2:00:42] <%Undenizen> see if he has skeleton legs when his pants come off

[2:05:02] <+xddddsorandom> I feel bad for people who go do host clubs stuff
[2:05:15] <SilverWolfX9> simps
[2:05:16] <+Jaysky> But why go to a hostess club when I can give money to a virtual dog girl
[2:05:27] <The_Maddness> Its like being an actoor, only on a personal basis
[2:05:32] <AFlyingTaco1> So did Pat say what the number needed for subs was? I missed the start of the stream.

[3:34:34] <%xMaSterKeef420bluntNinjAx> God damnit Daigo
[3:34:36] <%KineKithZen> Daigo lost to Justin Wong
[3:34:36] <%doc_ock_rokc> Daigo fucked up and kiryu is "Dead"
[3:34:38] <+DeltascapeV4> Tojo was already fucked before Daigo took over
[3:34:40] <akitanito> Tojo is just a failed clan
[3:34:41] <%sporeian94> WHAT HAPPENED TO MAJIMA?
[3:34:42] <morningmoondude> Daigoddamn
[3:34:43] <Divum_muviD> but it was because of the cops, not daigo really
[3:34:44] <Admiral_PopnFresh> Daigo "Kiryu's Son" Dojima
[3:34:45] <+lucaflowe> Holy shit Daigo
[3:34:45] <+pureotome> damnit daigo
[3:34:46] <mrapplebucks> its complicated
[3:34:47] <jimjamstrawberryslamalam> Daigoooooooo
[3:34:47] <%Xelhesia> DAIGO CAN NEVER DO SHIT RIGHT
[3:34:47] <%TheMattman1313> What a waste of a final letter, eh Kiryu?
[3:34:47] <Komayeda> I mean, where was Watase during all this
[3:34:49] <hassanico2> @PatStaresAt You mean Kiryu's son? Kappa
[3:34:50] <AFlyingTaco1> How is it Daigo's fault that they were betrayed?
[3:34:50] <+Dragon4234> @PatStaresAt Reminder that Pat cried for Daigo
[3:34:51] <%T_Sasquatch> Kiryu fucked over Diago tho
[3:34:53] <%chiazam> DAIGO COME ONNNNN
[3:34:53] <penitentpendant> Kiryu disappears for one game and the whole Tojo Family goes up in smoke
[3:34:54] <$lotharrio> REBUILD THE TOJO.
[3:34:54] <+chibicheezit> why did kiryu say daigo was his son again?
[3:34:56] <+skyheys> WHY IS DAIGO SO SHIT
[3:34:57] <tavirtapir> daigo :(
[3:34:57] <jellssssss20> Daigo needs to run every idea past Kazuma
[3:34:59] <%xMaSterKeef420bluntNinjAx> It should have been Kiryu in charge
[3:34:59] <%FalseEyeD> Where the HELL is Majima?
[3:34:59] <h0wiewong> It was a sinking ship since 1, let's be honest
[3:35:00] <%shunakiyama> It was due to the cops. nothing to do with daigo
[3:35:01] <%T_Sasquatch> Diago never wanted this shit
[3:35:02] <tranman090> How did Majima and Saeijima fucking go down?
[3:35:04] <KCFusecoast> Daigo is awful
[3:35:04] <%Piemono> Kiryu basically carried the Tojo on his back for 20 years
[3:35:11] <%eyezehuhh> @hassanico2 I was so mad at that line
[3:35:12] <+michingmallecho> Daigo,kiryu literally wrote you a letter and you still fucked it up

[3:35:15] <+SaltMaestroSupreme> HYPER FREAKS EVEN

[3:35:19] <+Dragon4234> Reminder that Pat cried for Daigo
[3:35:20] <melonsouda> @PatStaresAt Saejima was probably in prison again to be fair.
[3:35:22] <%Treuan> This guy's voice acting is rad
[3:35:24] <%Sotetsu> Doody
[3:35:24] <jellssssss20> He's still with Tojo
[3:35:26] <shieldecho> heh heh, duty
[3:35:27] <huskarl_zap> majima probably just left to simp for his waifu
[3:35:29] <%HefestoForges> it's all a ruse
[3:35:30] <+Blunder_Blue> Daigo got a shit deal because a simp murdered 90% of the high ranking Tojo officers and all that were left were power hungry crazy assholes trying to climb the latter and kill him.
[3:35:30] <%sporeian94> Where the fuck did Majima go?
[3:35:33] <+tigerfang86> Saejima is literally like Kiryu but bald
[3:35:34] <AFlyingTaco1> @PatStaresAt So Ichiban's VA is also Takatoshi Hijiyama's VA from 13 Sentinels.

[3:36:02] <%TheMattman1313> To be fair Majima only cares about Kiyu. He would let the Tojo die.
[3:36:03] <%YakumoYomi> Kasuga...doesn't understand the concept of time. And he's a dumbass.

[3:59:43] <+FleshFriend> well, he's gonna need a party with him later on
[3:59:44] <Sulfur_Boride> Him being the opposite of Kiryu also extends to his powerlevel, I guess
[3:59:44] <sightlesspoem> fuckin punklings

[4:07:35] <penitentpendant> I'm gonna guess he has a 'country' accent in the Japanese VA
[4:07:36] <%YakumoYomi> @PlagueOfGripes Both, most likely, since they likely "localized" the dialogue somewhat
[4:07:38] <televisedrevolting> A child would rather have anything else than come to the conclusion that their parent's might hate them.

[4:26:22] <%BoxNavy> UNBOCER
[4:26:25] <+twohitgood> maybe they open boxes?
[4:26:25] <%Taisuru> They do unboxing videos!

[4:26:31] <Louie_Salmon> Anti-boxer
[4:26:31] <RetributionP> Let it Die??!
[4:26:32] <Oxybe> Wouldn't an UnBoxer use kicks?
[4:26:36] <Jflaskd13> some Kingdom hearts names here
[4:26:37] <Maleicus> shouldnt they be kicking
[4:26:37] <+teh_rawk> more RP Gs need parries
[4:26:39] <oOZtkOo> the nega boxers
[4:26:42] <%Cykron> Cops will be cool again in a year or so
[4:26:44] <The_Maddness> they take things out of boxes
[4:26:44] <%blaggablag> Just a buncha menacing men in a sewer dungeon, you know, as you do
[4:26:45] <rosemon5001> i cant hear this voice and not think of yakisoba BUUUUUUUN
[4:26:46] <%TheBensonator_> STOMPED
[4:26:49] <%maybefalco> LUL
[4:26:50] <dots4eyes> I'm waiting for dual and triple techs
[4:26:51] <huskarl_zap> steve fox from virtua fighter?

[4:27:00] <wrydiculous> LUL
[4:27:01] <theanora1> Now that Lootcrate is dead all the unboxers are homeless!
[4:27:04] <%Kiyosuki> He's a washed up old detective type though
[4:27:06] <Louie_Salmon> I hate it when they slip around like a jackass
[4:27:13] <%ShinobiPhoenix> I have never heard the term unboxer
[4:27:13] <+MacBeyer> Yakuza: Like a Jackass
[4:27:13] <+tigerfang86> DEAD
[4:27:13] <%BubbaRands> Bobbin n weavin
[4:27:15] <penitentpendant> Gettin' better at Guardin'!
[4:27:15] <%Kiyosuki> they're a different breed
[4:27:19] <%Jack8274> BATON PASS!
[4:27:22] <%Kiyosuki> so its ok to like him now
[4:27:24] <akitanito> Did he stab him with the stick
[4:27:26] <huskarl_zap> he exploded him PogChamp
[4:27:27] <$lotharrio> Might be time to heal after this fight.
[4:27:27] <%Jack8274> It's a knockdown baton bass
[4:27:28] <%blaggablag> OW
[4:27:28] <MyNameIsRasus> This is no joke one of the best takes in classic turn based systems i've seen recently
[4:27:32] <king__theseus> I was doing the sidequests and just got slapped with a 20 gig update but at least I can watch pat play!
[4:27:35] <+teh_rawk> lotta yakuza just hang out in the sewers
[4:27:37] <h0wiewong> What are these yakuza doing in the sewer?
[4:27:39] <Louie_Salmon> Yeah detectives are always rad
[4:27:44] <The_Maddness> whats that on the ground?
[4:27:47] <mar_krow> Ssstyle
[4:27:53] <Fear_Ranjer> It's so good
[4:27:54] <Siconia> Half expected Coerthas Catacombs to come up on the screen at the start
[4:27:55] <+tigerfang86> it feels cool
[4:27:56] <Jflaskd13> so do i
[4:27:58] <%blaggablag> I unironically always dreamed of a franchise like Pokemon switching to a system like this for a change
[4:27:59] <Louie_Salmon> I think these are literally just sewer dudes, unrelated to anything
[4:28:00] <$lotharrio> I'm super into it.
[4:28:02] <%Jack8274> It flows better than the old one thats for sure
[4:28:03] <dabeaminator> It seems a little simplistic
[4:28:04] <penitentpendant> Rushin' for those ground attacks
[4:28:05] <%Kiyosuki> It does seem like a really solid battle system
[4:28:06] <GandhiTheTerrible> it feels great
[4:28:07] <%BoxNavy> does adachi have a high crit rate or something
[4:28:10] <Chaoswaahh> I see job exp
[4:28:12] <Jflaskd13> fresh take very much appreciated
[4:28:13] <%TheBensonator_> It's pretty nice
[4:28:15] <convo445> it is fast, and the heat move things will get pretty cool
[4:28:15] <mrapplebucks> why are these men beating up the homeless?
[4:28:18] <Chaoswaahh> do they become a wizard?
[4:28:20] <+Tragosavich> The combat for an RPG looks cool
[4:28:20] <+Goblinz_3> Always go the opposite way for loot pat Kappa
[4:28:21] <Louie_Salmon> I really expected this to be a jank mess, but it's fun
[4:28:21] <%cobalt_phoenix_> so is this fully turn based but you move freely, or is it kinda like ff7 remake
[4:28:22] <+gutlesscoward> it flows better than some of the older yakuzas, at least
[4:28:23] <Maleicus> i wonder if you could get advantage
[4:28:25] <h0wiewong> And it hasn't even really opened up yet
[4:28:25] <+BKNPham> why are there so many thugs hanging out in a sewer
[4:28:26] <+tigerfang86> AAAAA
[4:28:28] <+Silenteagle3> @BoxNavy Attacking someone on the ground is an auto crit
[4:28:31] <dots4eyes> He ran so far
[4:28:32] <%chiazam> guard
[4:28:33] <%Cykron> Detectives are just the Cop prestige class
[4:28:33] <+teh_rawk> positioning is important
[4:28:35] <+Deko_> damn
[4:28:37] <huskarl_zap> SEWER BOMBER PogChamp
[4:28:37] <%goatbait> Sewer thugs
[4:28:38] <%chiazam> or not lmao
[4:28:42] <GeltonZ> @cobalt_phoenix_ Fully turn based.
[4:28:43] <NeroInfinite> So the ol FFXII trick
[4:28:45] <+Mendin> DEAD
[4:28:49] <wrydiculous> jeez those crits
[4:28:49] <Digsby> Does seem to be an active bit to hitting grounded guys before they get up though
[4:28:49] <%BoxNavy> @Silenteagle3 yeah i noticed literally right after i said that lol
[4:28:55] <penitentpendant> Clean that dungeon of encounters
[4:28:58] <%blaggablag> The thugs procreate in the sewers, it becomes a problem
[4:29:01] <%cobalt_phoenix_> @GeltonZ yo that's cool thanks
[4:29:03] <%Niney_Who> nice
[4:29:03] <Zebroneath> it's also good how fast they are if the enemies are weak
[4:29:05] <%Kiyosuki> when Yakuza does a modern Active Time Battle system possibly better than FF LUL
[4:29:06] <%ShinobiPhoenix> 17 on a PERFECT?!
[4:29:07] <%Pookiedaexzile> Does japan really rock sewers this big
[4:29:08] <%StevorenoElcamino> I actually was thrown off at first being so used to seeing you play the older ones but I’m legitimately intrigued by the combat so far.
[4:29:08] <%Jack8274> No
[4:29:08] <josemoya95> attacking in ther ground probabaly has higher or auto crit
[4:29:09] <GandhiTheTerrible> no
[4:29:10] <CurrySauseBandit> Wasn't good
[4:29:11] <%ClericOfSparda> No
[4:29:11] <%코코꾸라> No, you missed it
[4:29:11] <convo445> low health

[4:29:13] <akitanito> Adachi's taking a lot of damage
[4:29:13] <mortificent> nope
[4:29:14] <tanarath> It was bad
[4:29:16] <%chiazam> It's a qte pat
[4:29:16] <+PenGia> the y timing is obnoxiously jank
[4:29:18] <Louie_Salmon> @cobalt_phoenix_ Yeah any time his character moves that's just automatic
[4:29:18] <penitentpendant> Need to heal your tank
[4:29:19] <+tigerfang86> no
[4:29:19] <%Jack8274> To soon
[4:29:19] <Jolly_Adventurer> nope
[4:29:20] <Blank9> press Y when it's overlapping the Y and stops moving, it's a real late press
[4:29:21] <%MonsterEnvy> @PatStaresAt Apparently the battles are all Kasuga imagination. They are just fighting normally
[4:29:23] <%bevyrage> i am legit appreciating that the game is handling these random battles with more tact than most jrpg's. into fights fast, out of fights fast, and you can't even notice the grind happening
[4:29:24] <+PenGia> you gotta hit the center ring
[4:29:25] <akitanito> Perfect Miss
[4:29:27] <penitentpendant> Whiff

[4:29:30] <%HefestoForges> whoa

[4:29:35] <+twohitgood> your tank is nearly dead
[4:29:36] <GandhiTheTerrible> inside
[4:29:36] <%chiazam> Pat it's just a circle

[4:29:49] <+Silenteagle3> At the very center
[4:29:50] <tanarath> when it's right at the centergslightly late
[4:29:50] <%goatbait> With an rpg style combat the devs have more control over the flow of combat
[4:29:51] <+TheBitingIrish> WTF
[4:29:52] <MyNameIsRasus> Adachi's dead
[4:29:52] <+teh_rawk> adachi needs energy drink

[4:30:13] <%ClericOfSparda> Do you have a revive?
[4:30:14] <%chiazam> Can you raise a downed ally?
[4:30:15] <+Jaysky> Went down like a sack of potatos
[4:30:15] <%Pookiedaexzile> HE need some Milk
[4:30:22] <+Solutha> Yeah the other games its usually fast as possible on those
[4:30:23] <%coreyyotto> Don't forget, you get a full heal every level. Don't be afraid to use items
[4:30:24] <+scottmou> scottmou subscribed with Prime.

[4:30:29] <%AoiRob> BibleThump
[4:30:32] <GandhiTheTerrible> 0.3x exp
[4:30:33] <+teh_rawk> oh no its one of those gmaes where if you die you dont get exp
[4:30:33] <dabeaminator> That result screen is Persona 5 as hell
[4:30:35] <%Jack8274> You only get 0.3x xp if your dead
[4:30:35] <$lotharrio> Dragon Quest and Earthbound have it so early enemies sometimes waste turns.
[4:30:39] <GeltonZ> YAY! I love 1HP post battle revives!
[4:30:39] <Jnkolm> oh interesting he only gains 30% of exp cuz he big dead
[4:30:43] <%goatbait> THought he was gonna be a coffin that follows you
[4:30:46] <%TheBensonator_> neat
[4:30:47] <%blaggablag> phoenix down his ass
[4:30:49] <Blank9> I love that you get full HP/MP on level up
[4:30:50] <%Jack8274> @teh_rawk You get 30% at least
[4:30:51] <%Taisuru> When is a cat going to tell Ichiban to go to bed
[4:30:54] <h0wiewong> Better than not getting anything
[4:30:54] <+Jaysky> MENACING
[4:31:04] <%blaggablag> Just, drag a corpse around the sewer floor
[4:31:04] <+artschooltrash> Are all the games stories this serious? I've only seen the goofy shit from the other ones and it never interested me but I am surprisingly in love with this one so far.
[4:31:12] <Noogiez> slippery jackass
[4:31:13] <%BoxNavy> get unboxed
[4:31:17] <%QueequegTheater> Does Adachi have easier perfect guards because he's the tank
[4:31:17] <%cobalt_phoenix_> WOW
[4:31:18] <Louie_Salmon> @GeltonZ Do any modern games do that? Pretty sure that's strictly an old thing now
[4:31:18] <%ShinobiPhoenix> those hits are WAY too strong if Perfect Guard isn't eating the hit
[4:31:21] <h0wiewong> It blends goofy and serious
[4:31:21] <Jnkolm> Ichiban's perfect guard animation is wonderful
[4:31:24] <+Silenteagle3> @artschooltrash Yep, the actual main stories of these games lean on serious.
[4:31:24] <%코코꾸라> @artschooltrash It's a mix of goofy and serious
[4:31:26] <h0wiewong> For the most part the story is serious
[4:31:32] <+tigerfang86> @artschooltrash every yakuza story is serious as fuck, and every yakuza side story is goofy as fuck
[4:31:34] <%Cykron> Clearing out the Sewer Antifa
[4:31:36] <%Kiyosuki> The Yakuza games are goofy generally but the story points get pretty serious
[4:31:39] <%MonsterEnvy> Yeah the games have serious stories. But goofy other stuff.
[4:31:39] <+tigerfang86> thats how it be
[4:31:40] <CurrySauseBandit> @ShinobiPhoenix He has no equipment on.
[4:31:40] <%toastybites> @artschooltrash the main story is usually pretty serious, with the side quests being wacky
[4:31:41] <penitentpendant> @artschooltrash The whole series is bipolar. It switches between serious crime drama and super goofy side stuff.
[4:31:46] <%Kiyosuki> Although this game seems like its actively going more towards comedy on purpose
[4:31:47] <h0wiewong> Though the new protagonist is way more laid back than the other one
[4:31:50] <%iswearimjustdandy> @artschooltrash they are all as serious as they are goofy, the tone fluctuates wildly but somehow works anyway
[4:31:50] <dabeaminator> Does skipping around increase their evasion?
[4:31:57] <+tigerfang86> BETTER AT COP
[4:31:57] <%JeanGardner99> Dang Pat might catch up to me, spent like an hour on a mini game lol
[4:32:03] <%QueequegTheater> no, it's a taunt
[4:32:04] <$lotharrio> @dabeaminator It's an attempted taunt
[4:32:05] <hassanico2> When do we fight OROCHI
[4:32:08] <GeltonZ> @Louie_Salmon Do what? Party members staying dead after combat? It has been a while but I'm pretty sure a few do.
[4:32:09] <Saltmeisterr> @dabeaminator enrages the enemy
[4:32:10] <%SmoochSpider> good ol sewer mushrooms
[4:32:10] <%bevyrage> skipping around is an attempt to taunt
[4:32:13] <+olive_js> just got here. how is the game so far? @patstaresat
[4:32:13] <MyNameIsRasus> This is layed out like an SMT dungeon
[4:32:19] <+artschooltrash> Nice, thanks for the responses. Might dip my toes in with this one
[4:32:21] <+Silenteagle3> "My wife was hunted down by yakuza and my child suffered multiple organ failure"
[4:32:22] <indig0bird> This is seriously a lot better than I thought when I first thought turn based
[4:32:31] <+Silenteagle3> "I'm letting these guys smack me because I like Dragon Quest"
[4:32:32] <+paladinstarbuster> nice
[4:32:36] <+aznjackh> it's crazy how dungeonish this looks lol
[4:32:38] <amonimis> not the sewer yakuzer
[4:32:39] <h0wiewong> Should also be noted the system is "If Ichiban dies, game over"
[4:32:41] <+Silenteagle3> That dissonance is literally this game so far
[4:32:44] <%ShinobiPhoenix> @GeltonZ Dragon Quest stays the tradition, so they stay dead
[4:32:44] <+tigerfang86> THROW A BASEBALL
[4:32:45] <CurrySauseBandit> Try it
[4:32:46] <penitentpendant> So to anyone whose played this, do you get bonus damage if you match inputs with your normal attacks?
[4:32:46] <Blank9> throw a baseball
[4:32:47] <%cobalt_phoenix_> mmm baseball
[4:32:49] <%chiazam> EQUIP
[4:32:52] <Jnkolm> It is a ball
[4:32:52] <+twohitgood> yakuza is the jrpg it was always destined to be.
[4:32:52] <%BoxNavy> throw that ball
[4:32:53] <Profmcstevie> The Yakuza team would never go for a STANDARD turn based system
[4:32:56] <%Jack8274> @h0wiewong Like Persona
[4:32:56] <%ClericOfSparda> Why not?
[4:32:58] <%goatbait> Oh shit this is totally a dungeon
[4:32:59] <$lotharrio> Use item for damage. Probably okay or something. Whatever.
[4:32:59] <Zehdre> I think when we hear turn-based we instantly sigh at the thought of long battle intros and outros.
[4:33:00] <Fear_Ranjer> OH FANTASTIC
[4:33:02] <MyNameIsRasus> OH THAT'S A BASEBALL
[4:33:04] <%chiazam> GEAR
[4:33:05] <%AzureGale> mmm, hard balls
[4:33:07] <%SmoochSpider> YAY
[4:33:08] <+Silenteagle3> Standard attacks do not have timed hits
[4:33:08] <Joestar1890> COOLERS
[4:33:10] <h0wiewong> Rip
[4:33:11] <%MonsterEnvy> Boss battle coming.
[4:33:12] <%Taisuru> I wish Zangief was Baseball
[4:33:12] <+teh_rawk> story is generally pretty serious, side stuff borders on slapstick
[4:33:13] <%sporeian94> BOSS TIME
[4:33:13] <penitentpendant> Persona!
[4:33:15] <DeltaPangaea> Is it just me or are some of those newbie yakuza with knives trying to ape majima? I think those are tiger jackets anyway
[4:33:16] <%linSP> RESTART
[4:33:17] <%iswearimjustdandy> Tonal dissonance is a featured draw of yakuza as a series if anything
[4:33:18] <huskarl_zap> SEWER PANTY DISPENSER? PogChamp
[4:33:18] <%JeanGardner99> @penitentpendant seems its just for Skill attacks so far
[4:33:18] <akitanito> It's basically a def down
[4:33:20] <%MonsterEnvy> This super means a boss is coming
[4:33:20] <h0wiewong> RIP the min-maxing
[4:33:20] <%AzureGale> Well, now you know
[4:33:22] <%QueequegTheater> Bonfire baybee
[4:33:22] <%Kiyosuki> fully stocked mini fridge in the sewers LUL
[4:33:22] <%Jack8274> OH BABY That's what I love near a save point
[4:33:23] <%BoxNavy> boss monkaS
[4:33:24] <PE4X> I think i actually prefer it now that i played a few hours with it
[4:33:25] <%SmoochSpider> like ff7 remake
[4:33:25] <$Skelemungus> who put a vending machine in the sewers
[4:33:27] <+kurono_alt> As bad as Dead Souls is, with that and this battle system, I'm glad RGG Studio isn't afraid to experiment with new ways to keep the games interesting
[4:33:28] <dabeaminator> I can't believe there are dungeons
[4:33:28] <%chiazam> You can EQUIP the ball
[4:33:31] <Allrthur> ff7 bench
[4:33:31] <%Jack8274> EWWWWWWWWWWWWWW
[4:33:32] <peanutdot007> Time to fight guys and then run back to the recovery spot every time
[4:33:32] <%rumtumtugnutz> ff7? Is that you?
[4:33:35] <+teh_rawk> ew
[4:33:39] <%SmoochSpider> poison damage
[4:33:40] <huskarl_zap> DIRTY TENGU PogChamp
[4:33:42] <%BoxNavy> ew
[4:33:44] <Explodincatz> magic?!
[4:33:45] <%linSP> dirty towel +2 magic
[4:33:45] <+AtlasMcCoy> ew
[4:33:45] <%toastybites> oh god
[4:33:46] <%asgard147> This is just straight up an RPG now
[4:33:48] <h0wiewong> Literal garbage armor
[4:33:50] <%Jack8274> Oh I that that was a dirty Tengu
[4:33:50] <srcalavera94> MAGIC STAT
[4:33:50] <%Taisuru> Pat's Towel!
[4:33:50] <DingusMcBaseball> gross
[4:33:51] <%chiazam> WEAPON
[4:33:52] <huskarl_zap> tenga i mean
[4:33:53] <%cobalt_phoenix_> whywhywhy
[4:33:55] <Gallhint> Dirty Tenga
[4:33:56] <theanora1> wouldn't be an RPG if you didn't burn healing items right before a healing spot
[4:34:00] <mrapplebucks> kinky
[4:34:00] <Guardiansaiyan> HHHHMMMMMMMMMMM
[4:34:01] <scrumbotime> aww it doesn't have Visible Equipment
[4:34:01] <dots4eyes> Dirty ten guy
[4:34:02] <h0wiewong> RPG elements
[4:34:04] <%dellakitty> thought pat said "dirty tampon"
[4:34:05] <%Pookiedaexzile> That Towel got some magic innit aight
[4:34:05] <penitentpendant> @JeanGardner99 K. A couple of pats normals have turned yellow and I was wondering if those were crits or timed hits.
[4:34:05] <waffleandman> can you imagine if they put the materia system in?
[4:34:06] <Guardiansaiyan> yikes
[4:34:08] <%kyh9> But Ichiban plays Dragon Quest, not DMC
[4:34:14] <huskarl_zap> Slightly used Tenga
[4:34:17] <%Jack8274> I'm really into it
[4:34:17] <%TheActuallyGuyR7> Max is playing DMC5 SE on Series X and the framerate tanks to 30 at 1080p with RTX ON.
[4:34:18] <Top_Lane_Duelist> RPG? always has been
[4:34:18] <%goatbait> Like going from Kingdom Hearts to Dragon Quest
[4:34:22] <+jiggy_snipe> it had rpg elements before
[4:34:25] <COMB711> Ichi being a huge dork who picks up clothes in the sewer and imagines their stats is killing me
[4:34:25] <h0wiewong> Well there's Judgement
[4:34:25] <+gutlesscoward> I wonder what the first boss will be
[4:34:30] <P3_FeMC_best_girl> i think they retired kiryu after 6 tho
[4:34:31] <+teh_rawk> they said they would revert if this game wasnt popular
[4:34:34] <+Ancopro> i like both this is hard
[4:34:34] <%Mr_Pylon> Also more like Judgement too
[4:34:35] <%sporeian94> Next game is a FPS
[4:34:36] <%BoxNavy> this concept is too good to just throw out
[4:34:37] <mortificent> I feel it's gonna be mainline and Judgment
[4:34:38] <%JeanGardner99> @penitentpendant Crits are the yellows
[4:34:39] <%QueequegTheater> So the baseball is just a blunt nagatama
[4:34:40] <randomahole> ten guys, burgers and burgers and fries and fries
[4:34:41] <%Pookiedaexzile> It's an Rpg and you now work with the police
[4:34:47] <Jnkolm> I hear it's selling/sold well in Japan so they very well might do more
[4:34:49] <haitakaa> kiryu is long gone
[4:34:50] <%sporeian94> What gameplay styles has Yakuza yet to try
[4:34:52] <%T_Sasquatch> I don't want Kiryu anymore. Retire him
[4:34:57] <Blank9> or... at least you work with the DMV
[4:34:58] <mortificent> Judgment has the best action combat, imo
[4:35:03] <%BoxNavy> monkaS
[4:35:05] <%Kiyosuki> Yeah Kiryu's story is over
[4:35:05] <Fear_Ranjer> That is WAY too much blood
[4:35:08] <+Silenteagle3> @sporeian94 4X.
[4:35:08] <%Kiyosuki> I don't mind cameos though
[4:35:09] <%sporeian94> They did RTS with the majima construction, beat-em up with mainline, RPG with this...
[4:35:10] <%AzureGale> Wow he's bleeding buckets
[4:35:12] <Noogiez> thas a lot of blood
[4:35:12] <dabeaminator> I don't see much point in buying DMC 5 SE when Vergil is going to be DLC for the current gen version anyway. Especially if SE runs poorly.
[4:35:15] <h0wiewong> Though Judgment combat was so good
[4:35:28] <%HefestoForges> jesus
[4:35:32] <%dellakitty> oozing koolaid
[4:35:33] <%Kiyosuki> Especially if they contrast how much of a lovable loser Ichiban is to Kiryu who seems to be what Ichiban WANTS to be. LUL
[4:35:41] <+teh_rawk> @PatStaresAt did you ever finish judgement?
[4:35:42] <%AzureGale> Giant bleeds DO suck
[4:35:50] <%Taisuru> BEEF DOG
[4:35:52] <penitentpendant> I like the 'next' that appears next to enemy lifebars when their turns follow a characters. Useful.
[4:35:53] <%maybefalco> man the ragdolling is so good
[4:35:55] <%chiazam> Mmmm that combat is tasty
[4:35:57] <haitakaa> his colostomy bag got punctured
[4:35:59] <MyNameIsRasus> I love these barks LUL
[4:36:00] <Blank9> this whole game is OLD MAN
[4:36:01] <%Jack8274> The characters are way more loveable
[4:36:03] <%코코꾸라> FRAUD
[4:36:06] <Saltmeisterr> this music is pretty bumping too
[4:36:09] <%Ner234> Currently judging
[4:36:09] <%chiazam> What does that do??????
[4:36:10] <%Taisuru> BOOOOOO
[4:36:10] <Joestar1890> SHAME!
[4:36:10] <melonsouda> SEWER WEED
[4:36:11] <%QueequegTheater> Chat was the Judgement all along
[4:36:12] <%AzureGale> I c wut u did there
[4:36:12] <tanarath> @patstaresat JUDGE
[4:36:13] <penitentpendant> Judged for JUDGMENT
[4:36:15] <randomahole> it's drugs!!
[4:36:16] <%asgard147> "Dad, Mom won't give me food" psaDogchamp
[4:36:17] <+teh_rawk> judgement final battle is dope
[4:36:17] <+Blunder_Blue> Judgement is the fucking best you're missing out
[4:36:18] <%Xelhesia> YUP
[4:36:18] <%Pookiedaexzile> Yes
[4:36:18] <star_feline> JUDGING
[4:36:19] <Noogiez> find the hobo king
[4:36:20] <%linSP> and talk to everyone?
[4:36:20] <MyNameIsRasus> I wonder how the Amon fight's gonna go
[4:36:22] <+Silenteagle3> A mysterious leaf restores mental points
[4:36:23] <%doomunderthestairs> I'm playing Judgement right now!
[4:36:28] <%Kharinite> Heh
[4:36:29] <$Skelemungus> hopefully
[4:36:29] <TheNewJapanGuy> BOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOO
[4:36:29] <%Pookiedaexzile> Scrap for conflict
[4:36:29] <%Starotter70> Nah, IGN it and skip everything LUL
[4:36:30] <CurrySauseBandit> Don't hoard, you get plenty of items
[4:36:33] <MarvelousMrD> if its like dragon quest then youd need to grind more than that
[4:36:33] <Maleicus> i can wait to grind
[4:36:38] <+Mendin> Amon just rides out on top of Culex
[4:36:38] <%BoxNavy> are those stanimans in that cooler
[4:36:40] <Maleicus> cant
[4:36:40] <+Blunder_Blue> Judgement is better than 0 IMO
[4:36:40] <%Kiyosuki> Judgement is Yakuza mixed with Ace Attorney, this is Yakuza mixed with JRPGs. Seems like they're just combining Yakuza with some other genre and seeing what sticks
[4:36:42] <jorniev> NEVER USE ITEMS EVER EVER
[4:36:44] <%cobalt_phoenix_> LUL
[4:36:45] <%TheWinged7> so, when does King Dragon send his regards?
[4:36:47] <qu3kl41n_the_impure_king> im smelling some grinding offscreen
[4:36:47] <%Taisuru> Skip everything and complain
[4:36:49] <Blank9> judgment will be good to go back to afterwards, it has a strong finish
[4:36:55] <waffleandman> aka shits getting real
[4:36:55] <star_feline> Hoard ALL the phoneix downs
[4:36:55] <%ClericOfSparda> You did save scum
[4:36:56] <+paladinstarbuster> If ichiban loves dragon quest does that mean he's religious
[4:36:59] <mortificent> play Judgment on PS5, apparently it runs at an uncapped 60fps
[4:37:01] <%Jack8274> LOL
[4:37:04] <%T_Sasquatch> psaGib
[4:37:04] <+teh_rawk> i wonder what the metal slime of thjis game is

[4:38:27] <RevolverBobkat> did they turn Yakuza into Paper Mario?
[4:38:29] <%Kiyosuki> Its why its ok to like them over regular cops lol
[4:38:30] <DeltaPangaea> So it looks like from my gathering that people get up from the ground on their turn, unless they're attacked with something that wants them standing, like Ichiban's big punch.

[4:49:34] <%SilvaChariot0133> Where's you motivation?
[4:49:37] <+teh_rawk> grabs finally work on bosses
[4:49:45] <+Mendin> That seemed like an ACtual Guard time
[4:49:45] <+tigerfang86> HIS HEAT IS RISING
[4:49:45] <%cobalt_phoenix_> PogChamp
[4:49:48] <%wibbwobbler> he went to prison 4 u? ichi is something else lol
[4:49:50] <%QueequegTheater> But do it though
[4:49:51] <+Seitine> I’m going to laugh my ass off if the Boss had dome all this shit so you could be in the family again. Or that it was a part of his reasons. You were banished from their family, not all of them (unless that was implied).
[4:49:51] <eimple> monkaS shard of glass
[4:49:53] <haitakaa> you can just hold block
[4:49:53] <+paladinstarbuster> take the turn
[4:49:54] <%SmoochSpider> ah fair
[4:49:55] <%Jack8274> BUT ITS A SUPER MOVE
[4:49:55] <hassanico2> HEAT AURAS EXIST INUNIVERSE LUL
[4:49:56] <+PenGia> well here they want you to guard
[4:49:57] <%HefestoForges> guard
[4:49:57] <%linSP> maybe guard because he's powered up
[4:49:58] <nuane> I understand pat, have a good fight
[4:49:59] <+starzo0> throw the baseball
[4:49:59] <%Fooguwu> Guard big attacks tho
[4:50:00] <%chiazam> oH but the DAMAGE
[4:50:00] <dots4eyes> So much sexual energy
[4:50:00] <+PenGia> but you are right
[4:50:06] <penitentpendant> Hmm, is that a Counter Stance or Heat Move?
[4:50:06] <KaitlynnHere> Parry!
[4:50:06] <melonsouda> You've just been told to guard
[4:50:11] <+senpapisweets> throw baseball!
[4:50:12] <%AtomicHeartSon> Where's your motivation?
[4:50:13] <%Jack8274> Nice
[4:50:13] <%linSP> IT WORKED
[4:50:14] <fattyboy067> YEA

[4:50:21] <+It_sjustjoey> Play the game good tho
[4:50:23] <$lotharrio> BASEBALL TIME!
[4:50:23] <+Jaromero435> Use Grenade LUL
[4:50:24] <+PenGia> Pat is correct to not guard vs mooks though
[4:50:25] <akitanito> Just burn your MP
[4:50:25] <%HefestoForges> so... wait out when it's special time
[4:50:25] <Blank9> baseball
[4:50:26] <+paladinstarbuster> hey IT WORKED
[4:50:29] <+alcoholoch> enemy heat move mitigated
[4:50:30] <tanarath> @wibbwobbler he went to prison willingly & volunteered. He WANTED to help.
[4:50:32] <%JeanGardner99> Man I just Perfect Guarded that one and went full attack omegalul
[4:50:32] <+Silenteagle3> Funniest part is that move missed me when I did it
[4:50:38] <Jolly_Adventurer> He's learning PogChamp
[4:50:40] <%AzureGale> Hey, Pat just unlocked his limiters
[4:50:42] <king__theseus> use grenade in items
[4:50:43] <%cobalt_phoenix_> jesus that much on perfects huh?
[4:50:45] <COMB711> That still does good damage on whiff
[4:50:45] <josemoya95> Ok I kinda miss the old combat, but this does look hype af
[4:50:45] <dante_9x> pat killin it with parry
[4:50:47] <+teh_rawk> @PatStaresAt how liberal are you with mp abilities in other RPGs?
[4:50:49] <%ShinobiPhoenix> if Ichiban was going to kill him, I would say he won't have to deal with Jo again, but since he won't, I expect to fight Jo again
[4:50:54] <Onamar> It does prevent bleeds though
[4:50:55] <%TheWinged7> probably increases with a stat
[4:50:55] <%Jack8274> There are prob skills to buff it
[4:50:56] <+TheBitingIrish> It really doesn't
[4:50:56] <Gallhint> probably cus he has wepon
[4:50:58] <h0wiewong> Every little bit helps
[4:51:00] <penitentpendant> Snack Break ftw!
[4:51:00] <eimple> Isnt there supposed to be a meeting going on in the room next door LUL
[4:51:02] <%chiazam> Why aren't you using up all your MP?
[4:51:03] <+illusiveSaint> too bad the blocks sucks
[4:51:03] <%linSP> wait items are free actions?
[4:51:05] <+Mendin> @cobalt_phoenix_ Jo powered up at like 65% hp
[4:51:07] <+griffball13> it save from status aliments tho
[4:51:07] <Profmcstevie> It does stop you from knockdown it seems
[4:51:10] <Fear_Ranjer> YOOO
[4:51:10] <%arcielardor> is that you moving him, Pat?
[4:51:11] <+tigerfang86> GOT EM\

[4:51:18] <CurrySauseBandit> It helps much more as stats increase

[4:51:21] <+Deko_> PogChamp
[4:51:21] <Maleicus> it seems to shave like a point of damage

[4:51:23] <Joestar1890> GOTTEM
[4:51:25] <+jiggy_snipe> it moves automatically
[4:51:25] <+Silenteagle3> It's probably also percent based

[5:06:42] <$lotharrio> My friend spent more time trying to win at shogi than playing these games.
[5:06:47] <+Lord0Mugen> @penitentpendant rather it get the REmake 1 treatment. Parasite Eve doesnt really need to change since it was already so different from regular RPG conventions.
[5:06:48] <%coreyyotto> You had to press RT
[5:06:49] <ThisIsLloyd> you didn't check the box just your inventory
[5:06:50] <+tigerfang86> you were looking at your own inventory
[5:06:52] <%SilvaChariot0133> Take a bath stinky
[5:06:53] <dots4eyes> Pat big gambler
