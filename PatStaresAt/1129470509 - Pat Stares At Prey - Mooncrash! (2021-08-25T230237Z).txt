[0:02:10] <+ThomasOfTroy> Get it together
[0:02:12] <@ssjklyco> "We taught her the wrong language as a joke"
[0:02:17] <FutaSnek> Is this spoilers?
[0:02:26] <FutaSnek> I'm still going thru main story

[0:02:28] <+Dova573> nah
[0:02:36] <%pokefan9956> makes watching the PPP vods such a pain
[0:02:43] <%Buzzard42> poggies
[0:02:43] <%YakumoYomi> I think Mooncrash is a "roguelite" mode?
[0:02:44] <whittacre> @FutaSnek nah, it's totally side content
[0:02:45] <FutaSnek> Good shit like a separate campaign?
[0:02:48] <+Dova573> mooncrash is standalone
[0:02:55] <FutaSnek> Aweeesome
[0:02:58] <@GeneralSCPatton> @FutaSnek There might be spoilers. Depends on Pat and Chat.
[0:03:00] <whittacre> it's barely even a campaign
[0:03:00] <+Dova573> yeh

[0:03:30] <%pokefan9956> I looked on the app store for picarto and noped out when I saw 1.5 stars
[0:03:45] <+Essixian> @FutaSnek It's more like a sort-of-roguelite mode. Several characters with different abilities, same map with some variations, different objectives depending on the character.
[0:03:53] <FutaSnek> So far this game has blown my mind and terrified me lmao
[0:03:54] <+fetrigon> @generalscpatton pat n chat

[0:11:30] <%Dopamien> @Saltmeisterr they showed maybe 10 seconds of something newish
[0:11:30] <ChaosedStar> Pats beard is growing mighty
[0:11:30] <%Broand> the award for nintendos were both ubisoft games that aren't out yet, Ubisoft won
[0:11:34] <@Lion_kun> It was rigged because they couldn't have the fromsoft dev speak three times lol
[0:11:39] <Coystick> Hey it let's Dorito Pope have a day, let him have a day.
[0:11:40] <%YakumoYomi> Tell me, Kermit
[0:11:46] <Sterski> Awards shows always go to whatever was recently popular.
[0:11:47] <%Dopamien> @Saltmeisterr release date 2-22 next year
[0:11:47] <%gustavozxd> @Saltmeisterr just some gameplay I think, nothing crazy
[0:11:50] <%Pappajimbo> the switch with two ubisoft games
[0:11:53] <xeros720> @Dopamien a little, just a release date trailer, feb. 22nd i believe
[0:11:54] <@QueequegTheater> @rambling_madman Concern
[0:11:56] <Bayliff> is this part of the kojima silent hills ARG?
[0:12:04] <+vascillia> Saints Row was the biggest dud. Long ass CG trailer with nothing at all resembling Saints Row- it should have been a long gameplay demo. Who gives a fuck about CG trailers in the last 10 years
[0:12:05] <%Bailey__gaming> Jeff is going to be in muppets
[0:12:09] <%PocketBearIllustrator> that was song fast typing
[0:12:13] <OldManDeckardCain> there should be an award for "most harassed employees" seems like it would be a fierce competition
[0:12:17] <%PocketBearIllustrator> some *
[0:12:20] <%jtdobyns> Can Neil Breen get an award?
[0:12:20] <%Ipsenscastle> To be fair, the creator of Syberia recently died, so it might have been some form of memorial type deal
[0:12:22] <%Lizard0TM> there was a Saints Row thing?

[0:13:18] <pavramz> NO PLS NO
[0:13:19] <@Lion_kun> I just wanna play the game already.
[0:13:19] <+Mrbaconator> DISC ROOM
[0:13:20] <ChaosedStar> loop deez nutz
[0:13:20] <%Woodywoo0100> Yes
[0:13:21] <%gustavozxd> yeah it's weird
[0:13:23] <+Thyzoon> because it looks rad
[0:13:25] <OldManDeckardCain> becaus they can
[0:13:26] <+Delenay> cause theres nothing else?
[0:13:26] <Coystick> I don't know it looks so Souless
[0:13:27] <%YakumoYomi> That's a good fucking question
[0:13:27] <Visorak6> The real loop of deathloop is the endless advertising loop I'm subjected to so help me god
[0:13:27] <bob900000> delay?
[0:13:27] <%hewlettfan96> Naaaah
[0:13:28] <+Chewygamer> ROUGELITE TAKEOVER LETS GOOOOOO
[0:13:29] <%gustavozxd> I'm hyped for it though
[0:13:29] <%RealThiele> LOOP, BROTHER
[0:13:30] <%pokefan9956> it looks pretty dang good
[0:13:31] <GiraffeInMyMouth> It's the new Dishonored
[0:13:31] <+SeanPrime22> Deathloop looks fuckin awesome
[0:13:32] <Tisaric> because it's been delayed so many times LUL
[0:13:32] <Madovir> overexposure has made me hate deathloop
[0:13:32] <+Kaiserzelcor> It's because the relationship between Sony and Beth dies right after its release
[0:13:33] <tanarath> It's a trashfire, pat
[0:13:34] <%Dakuu75> is death loop the one with that black guy and girl trying to kill each other?
[0:13:35] <infiltratian> because its all they have
[0:13:35] <%watts121> I actually don't know why Deathloop is at every fucking conference.
[0:13:36] <%twistedj3ster> it looks servicable, I'll enjoy it for 8 hours
[0:13:37] <Bayliff> is deathloop part of the silent hills ARG produced by hideo kojima?
[0:13:37] <%AncelDeLambert> I was done with Deathloop day one trailer one, and I am more and more done with it every press junket
[0:13:38] <Sterski> Lots of timeloop games these days. I like time loop plots, but still
[0:13:38] <Profmcstevie> Spent a LOT of money I reckon
[0:13:39] <xeros720> i actually want to see how the game actually plays, Prey being as good as it is hasn't soured me on it yet
[0:13:43] <%JoshManVGH> It's also been on sale since announcement
[0:13:44] <+vascillia> "saints woke" is a really really REALLY cringe stupid name, please don't ever say that
[0:13:44] <%AkronymCLT> deathloopy
[0:13:44] <MiamiMemory> DEATHLOOP? More like POOPLOOP! I'm dead inside.
[0:13:45] <+ThomasOfTroy> You're overpushed, that's how birth works
[0:13:45] <%gustavozxd> @Visorak6 that sounds like something kojima would do
[0:13:46] <%PocketBearIllustrator> I already forgot about Death Loop.
[0:13:47] <%RetroCop87> sunk costs?
[0:13:48] <KaiserMario> I think it's because it's a new IP and they aren't confident
[0:13:49] <Coystick> I like Arkane but no interest in the Sony Exclusive Deathloop
[0:13:50] <GiraffeInMyMouth> @SeanPrime22 yes
[0:13:53] <%watts121> it looks cool, but not cool enough to get a presentation every State of Play
[0:13:53] <+Catpurnicus> deathloop more like pushrope
[0:13:55] <%RealThiele> means it cost +
[0:13:56] <+Chewygamer> what happened to the cube

[0:14:18] <Bayliff> @Catpurnicus there's pills for that
[0:14:19] <%Dopamien> Can't wait for Deathloop 2: deathlooper
[0:14:21] <+rasend0ri> TriHard TriHard TriHard TriHard TriHard TriHard
[0:14:28] <Coystick> It's Dishonored without the beautiful setting
[0:14:30] <%watts121> @Bailey__gaming and yeah it feels like the game's hype train started years ago. Like I'm still surprised it isn't already out.
[0:14:33] <+Chewygamer> yea flap those cheeks
[0:14:34] <@GeneralSCPatton> I feel like optimal Deathloop gameplay is gonna look a lot like Hitman speedruns.
[0:14:34] <+vascillia> it's not a butt pillow, it's a cock and balls pillow when your cock and balls are too big
[0:14:35] <%gustavozxd> flappable ass cheeks
[0:14:35] <+Thyzoon> @PatStaresAt Pat how could you forget, we got a date da halo finally.

[0:15:47] <stantheman_97> eh?
[0:15:47] <%ChrisPlaysThing> Thanks crazy talk, removing the campaign liek that Kappa
[0:15:48] <brexdq> are woolie people here
[0:15:49] <%Dementedpenguin> But...... Halo is ALL ABOUT COOP AND MULTIPLAYER LUL
[0:15:50] <%peyodogo> when it does launch, it'd be really fun to see
[0:15:50] <SaltyAzteca> NICE, MADE IT IN TI-why is Pat doing the face
[0:15:51] <Coystick> Get farked mate you flew too close to the sun
[0:15:52] <%hewlettfan96> What
[0:15:52] <%pokefan9956> just play something else
[0:15:52] <DracaenaLeaf> I thought Multiplayer was launching at the same time
[0:15:52] <%SaiyanShoto> You did that on purpose
[0:15:53] <Madovir> when are they going to admit halo is early access
[0:15:53] <%Dakuu75> that new TMNT though~
[0:15:53] <%JoshManVGH> 343 is doing good choices
[0:15:53] <%Nahual_Amini> Damn
[0:15:54] <+rasend0ri> 😩
[0:15:54] <majindusto> YOU FOOL
[0:15:56] <%MidnightBurst12> dropping the ball real hard there
[0:15:57] <+Delenay> they want that xmas money
[0:15:59] <%barrakuta371> I know. it sucks
[0:16:01] <+Catpurnicus> woolie is not allowed to play games when they are popular, you know this
[0:16:04] <Profmcstevie> A HALO WITHOUT CO-OP SINGLEPLAYER NEED NOT EXIST
[0:16:04] <%JoshManVGH> An Open World Halo game
[0:16:04] <tanarath> Correct, it's a halo game, why tf not?
[0:16:05] <+Thyzoon> They honestly, honestly should have delayed it, but everyone would have been burned regardless. :(
[0:16:08] <Coystick> NO COOP, MUST RELEASE
[0:16:08] <Nealuigi> Scrap the whole game. Push it until Campaign is in the launch
[0:16:08] <+Delenay> its a live service now
[0:16:09] <+trashmanasam> @MistyMntns not the coop campign thats reg multiplayer
[0:16:09] <%BallerSwagBro9k> I mean only Halo 3 onward had coop Pat
[0:16:09] <%hewlettfan96> Ahhh why that sucksss
[0:16:12] <hraezlyrnoyaiba> Bibble game playthrough
[0:16:12] <majindusto> Hah
[0:16:13] <%crimsonharvest> the least exciting to watch kind of game
[0:16:15] <ChaosedStar> Halo without co-op lmao rip guess there be no reason for me to get it
[0:16:15] <@Lion_kun> Woolie would want to play it with LittleV anyway
[0:16:15] <bob900000> this is so stupid NotLikeThis
[0:16:16] <blackened61986> Yeah TMNT basically stole the show.
[0:16:21] <%Rutta8> thats like betrayal of its roots
[0:16:27] <+fetrigon> @brexdq yes, unfortunately, I am here. PunOko
[0:16:27] <%za7az> I fell for it, good job Pat lol
[0:16:28] <%hewlettfan96> WTF why NotLikeThis NotLikeThis NotLikeThis NotLikeThis
[0:16:29] <MiamiMemory> Just play Halo Reach campaign
[0:16:29] <susukouhai> steel's heavier than feathers...
[0:16:30] <@QueequegTheater> @PatStaresAt Now Woolie has time to play through 4 and 5 Kappa
[0:16:31] <Jetsfantasy> LUL
[0:16:31] <+rasend0ri> No co op for u🖕
[0:16:31] <+Freakin_Wolfy> Yeah, it's a Halo game. Halo isn't known for its coop, it's only had it for 20 years
[0:16:31] <+ThomasOfTroy> like this?
[0:16:33] <%Ipsenscastle> knew it
[0:16:34] <%Retinolgaming> That news aside, that would be sick, you guys could squad stream it.
[0:16:37] <%BallerSwagBro9k> LUL
[0:16:37] <%JoshManVGH> The Selling point of "Infinitie" is the open worldness... so of course that's not there at launch.
[0:16:39] <%Rutta8> Ive been had!
[0:16:40] <%Pappajimbo> games as a service is great aint it
[0:16:41] <majindusto> TMNT HAS PLAYABLE  APRIL
[0:16:42] <Dunmarkh> fuck reality
[0:16:43] <kingmemelord97> damn it pat
[0:16:45] <tanarath> @ballerswagbro9k halo 1 had coop
[0:16:45] <Coystick> Oh you shit
[0:16:46] <%hewlettfan96> LUL
[0:16:47] <+fetrigon> garbage 🗑️
[0:16:47] <hraezlyrnoyaiba> Oh you
[0:16:49] <%Dopamien> it sounded a little genuine at first
[0:16:50] <%hewlettfan96> Ahhhhhh
[0:16:53] <marvel877> All that I cared about the show was TMNT and Cult of the Lamb.
[0:16:54] <%RealThiele> psaSmug
[0:16:55] <%Dakuu75> @ThomasOfTroy yep
[0:16:58] <%gustavozxd> you can't say pathetic without....
[0:16:59] <+Catpurnicus> remember when multiple people could play halo at once on the same console and copy of the game
[0:17:00] <%hewlettfan96> Douche
[0:17:02] <KaiserMario> Pat, don't be so negative, games can still be fun sometimes
[0:17:02] <cochramd1992> oh how the mighty have fallen
[0:17:02] <@commanderclaw> Anyone who has faith in 343 is a fool at this point
[0:17:03] <%TheotherKristian> SPLITSCREEN IS AVAILABLE..... I gueesss
[0:17:05] <%JoshManVGH> This has that Deatiny stank on it
[0:17:06] <%lloyddboy> halo more cursed than cursed halo
[0:17:07] <blackened61986> Yeah 343 is a curse.
[0:17:11] <+ThomasOfTroy> @ThomasOfTroy Nice, thank you
[0:17:14] <Profmcstevie> IT'S SHIT EVERYWHERE
[0:17:15] <+Thyzoon> I feel like I can give it a slide because it's open worldish this time around and tethering could be a bitch
[0:17:20] <%jtdobyns> they are both cursed
[0:17:20] <Sterski> I hate games that have NPCs with you constantly, reminding you that you should be playing co-op, but this is NOT what I wanted instead
[0:17:21] <$DocMadfox> It's sad the thing I'm most excited about in gaming this week is a new Tropico 6 DLC tomorrow.
[0:17:22] <%RealThiele> everyone gets shitup
[0:17:25] <%Retinolgaming> Time to bring in the new devs 434
[0:17:27] <%peyodogo> idc about halo honestly i just miss the playin games with woolie thing
[0:17:29] <%TheotherKristian> Splitscreen on Xbox will be available at launch and THAT'S IT
[0:17:29] <%JoshManVGH> And crash it
[0:17:30] <@MistyMntns> Space GHOSTS
[0:17:32] <%twistedj3ster> MOONGANG MOONGANG MOONGANG
[0:17:37] <bob900000> glad reach was the only halo game I played
[0:17:39] <%Treasure_Vault> Is the Berlin Interpretation of Rogelikes full of shit?
[0:17:39] <HyperionXV> We're whalers on the moon
[0:17:39] <%JoshManVGH> Moons haunted!
[0:17:40] <%Lizard0TM> I wish they would just delay Infinite further and FINISH THE FUCKING GAME FIRST
[0:17:40] <+Freakin_Wolfy> Pat, if you weren't a streamer, what job would you be doing?
[0:17:40] <%MidnightBurst12> is it haunted?
[0:17:40] <%RealThiele> MOON KNIGHT?
[0:17:41] <%megadblitz> how long til halo goes to the old pepol home
[0:17:42] <%gustavozxd> moon? That's in november pat
[0:17:43] <%Dakuu75> I would rather have someone beat me to death with my gen 1 PS3, than play split screen

[0:18:04] <doctor_be> oh yeah, canadians didnt get williams street stuff did they
[0:18:09] <DavidSanChan> don't touch me
[0:18:12] <+PatchTheSquid> @anAngryHamster Splitgate came out like last week and it's mid.
[0:18:20] <%Broand> It's time to show how new I am here and say I don't know what a zapping system is, I looked for an explanation from pat in the past but all I heard was him getting super mad at a game about Romans
[0:18:20] <%Dopamien> haha Pat can't time me out calebKek
[0:18:28] <%PocketBearIllustrator> totes cool
[0:18:29] <brexdq> @fetrigon sorry you have to deal with him till woolie comes back :
[0:18:30] <%RealThiele> FF14 Patch 5.65 Mooncrash
[0:18:30] <@QueequegTheater> @Broand Based
[0:18:33] <%Order_of_Mystery> "And you should be dumpster diving for scraps, you six-piece chicken McNobody!" ~ My favorite space ghost quote
[0:18:35] <%Meekest> Just like Heavy Rain
[0:18:40] <%MidnightBurst12> it's that easy
[0:18:47] <%snow_bush> snow_bush subscribed at Tier 1. They've subscribed for 33 months! Something something 33 monthsPat, speaking of goblinsI recently am working through my 40k backlog and I misjudged how many parts I had left to build a squad.I now either buy jacked up ebay kits to get 10 total or buy a cheaper kit that leaves extras
[0:18:56] <+fetrigon> @brexdq thanks majinoTears
[0:19:04] <Coystick> WAIT 2 YEARS
[0:19:07] <doctor_be> Pathfinder is crunchy as hell, and would be horrible to stream
[0:19:09] <%RealThiele> psaBig face scrape game
[0:19:11] <doctor_be> and I love pathfinder
[0:19:24] <@Spydurman> Baldur's Gate 3
[0:19:30] <@GeneralSCPatton> But wait for the patches
[0:19:30] <+Freakin_Wolfy> It's sad that you're right
[0:19:34] <@Lion_kun> Based Pat
[0:19:41] <%MidnightBurst12> facts
[0:19:42] <%Order_of_Mystery> Divinity Original Sin 1 and 2
[0:19:44] <%Treasure_Vault> Playing Divinity 2 at launch was a mistake
[0:19:45] <doctor_be> Ive played pathfinder tabletop and as a CRPG, Its MATH
[0:19:48] <%AncelDeLambert> I will touch Baldur's Gate 3 when, and only when, it has Dragonborn
[0:19:53] <kingmemelord97> outterworlds was pretty good on launch
[0:19:59] <%Lone_Xeno> how long has the stream been up?
[0:20:02] <Sterski> Just like I bet most people did with Disco
[0:20:02] <cochramd1992> I don't understand
[0:20:07] <%hewlettfan96> Divinity 2 was absolutely wank
[0:20:12] <%Order_of_Mystery> @AncelDeLambert Same. Fingers crossed for kobolds too!
[0:20:19] <@Lion_kun> Don't play it.
[0:20:19] <%big_boss_baby> @Lone_Xeno look under the sub button
[0:20:21] <%crimsonharvest> still dont play it, wait for the 'definitive edition'
[0:20:24] <%PocketBearIllustrator> so waiting until the base game AND the expansion(s) make too much sense?
[0:20:25] <%Mr_Pylon> Then you wait for the Definitive Edition
[0:20:25] <%Treasure_Vault> Once there is an official mod list to maximize your run, play it
[0:20:25] <%Rancaliber_> Rancaliber_ subscribed with Prime. They've subscribed for 25 months! Hey Pat, was glad to hear you enjoyed Prey, and hope you enjoy Mooncrash! I enjoyed it up to the point where my game crashed in the middle of a run, which hard reset all my progress. Keep on keeping on!
[0:20:28] <%RealThiele> the woolie method
[0:20:29] <wolfen091> so wait 5 years
[0:20:29] <xeros720> wait for the GOTY version, got it
[0:20:30] <+ThomasOfTroy> Honestly, I almost always wait to buy games until they get cheaper, which usually means that they get massively improved by the time I actually buy ut
[0:20:31] <SkinnyRite> So I should buy Midnight Fight Express... and not play it
[0:20:32] <%za7az> Just never plan it LUL
[0:20:33] <@GeneralSCPatton> But what if replay value?
[0:20:33] <Profmcstevie> Play it when it's DONE done
[0:20:35] <%za7az> *play
[0:20:36] <%Order_of_Mystery> Divinity 2 at launch and now are entirely different games
[0:20:38] <doctor_be> The difference with the pathfinder games is most of the content they have or can add is stuff that was already made for tabletop pathfinder
[0:20:39] <ELkasle> ahaha im still waiting for FF 15 dlc
[0:20:40] <%MidnightBurst12> or you can just play day one :)
[0:20:44] <%Treasure_Vault> Definitive Edition
[0:20:47] <%solracc25> NO MANS SKY!
[0:20:51] <%Lefanque> or play it twice
[0:20:52] <%AncelDeLambert> a CRPG
[0:20:52] <%xMaSterKeef420bluntNinjAx> Yeah like waiting until Pillars of Eternity 2 had the turn based mode
[0:20:53] <%Dakuu75> @PatStaresAt how about I don't play any of those and just watch you play it?
[0:20:54] <+FennecZephyr> I'll uninstall Wasteland then
[0:20:56] <%PlainSimpleTailor> 4x Strategy games?
[0:20:56] <Sterski> What about grand strategy
[0:20:57] <%Ipsenscastle> real talk
[0:20:59] <@Lion_kun> Witcher 3
[0:21:02] <ape_hawk> you mean PoE 2?
[0:21:02] <%RealThiele> PUT IT BACK IN!
[0:21:02] <+Catpurnicus> I thought this was going to be a FO4: New Vegas bit
[0:21:03] <+Thyzoon> Divinity 2 I waited and it was fantastic
[0:21:04] <@Lion_kun> Cyberpunk
[0:21:07] <%BallerSwagBro9k> Final DlC drops soon for WL3 @patstaresat
[0:21:09] <+ThomasOfTroy> Also, going back like 6 months, a year to play dlc and expansions SUCKS
[0:21:15] <@MistyMntns> I need to get back into No Man's Sky
[0:21:16] <Coystick> Plus you get the whole package for cheap if you wait
[0:21:23] <Captbutt> deadfire adding turn based combat
[0:21:24] <%Order_of_Mystery> that's good advice
[0:21:25] <%AncelDeLambert> isometric tabletop RPG adaptation is THE series to just leave on the stove
[0:21:25] <Coystick> Fuck I got Wasteland 2 for free
[0:21:27] <%g0atmeal> I'm still waiting for Blasphemous to stop getting updates before playing
[0:21:28] <%solracc25> Skyrim
[0:21:38] <%shurtal> I've never seen this game played outside of a Game Done Quick event, so it'll be interesting how it looks went perfect videogam player PatStaresAt plays it!
[0:21:40] <@commanderclaw> Only play on release if you're crazy and do multiple playthroughs
[0:21:41] <+ThomasOfTroy> For real
[0:21:44] <kingmemelord97> fo4 was good on launch to
[0:21:45] <%jtdobyns> hope they have fishing haha
[0:21:46] <%HotSauceFiend> Speaking of PoE2 how does it compare with PoE 1?
[0:21:52] <rambling_madman> you are not allowed to play with ATLUS characters in monkey ball, you must pay
[0:21:55] <doctor_be> except honest hearts raised the level cap
[0:21:55] <%Bluwizard21> i did and ur right
[0:21:58] <%RealThiele> thanks dark souls DLC
[0:21:59] <%twistedj3ster> it was the worst one tho
[0:21:59] <Captbutt> @HotSauceFiend way better than poe 1
[0:22:01] <Coystick> Hahahahaha
[0:22:01] <+Thyzoon> no it was NOT
[0:22:04] <+bluescreen1988> lol
[0:22:04] <+ThomasOfTroy> That's a damned lie
[0:22:04] <%twistedj3ster> NO IT WAS NOT
[0:22:04] <%Meekest> lol what
[0:22:05] <%crimsonharvest> Underrail's DLC is sort of cool in that you can go straight to it without slogging through the base endgame
[0:22:05] <%AncelDeLambert> no it was not, it is still not
[0:22:06] <$DocMadfox> I like Fallout 4 and no
[0:22:06] <%Meekest> No it wasnt
[0:22:06] <Madovir> no
[0:22:07] <KosOrSomeSayKosm_> it was not
[0:22:08] <%Broand> No.
[0:22:08] <@QueequegTheater> Better on launch than New Vegas
[0:22:08] <doctor_be> oh god it was buggy as hell at launch
[0:22:08] <%MidnightBurst12> not at all
[0:22:08] <%Mr_Pylon> lol it was NOT
[0:22:09] <%JamesCorck> Fallout 4 was never good.
[0:22:09] <%Pappajimbo> no
[0:22:09] <+NeonNobleKalzeria> FO4 was very much terrible
[0:22:09] <%peyodogo> oh dude fo4 was EXTREMELY NOT
[0:22:09] <+ThomasOfTroy> It's not good NOW
[0:22:09] <%HotSauceFiend> f04 was not good on launch
[0:22:10] <Jetsfantasy> That's fuckin' bait
[0:22:10] <%TIME_PUNCHER> the fuck it was
[0:22:10] <draca23> Fallout 4 is the worst case of that with its 3 dlcs/expansions of crafting that is completely pointless for your post game character.
[0:22:10] <%optimasmaximas> witcher 3 was good to play on launch....not counting the bugs LUL
[0:22:11] <%VictorVonLouche> it was awful
[0:22:11] <+SeanPrime22> big no to that one
[0:22:11] <ape_hawk> fallout 4 isnt even good NOW
[0:22:12] <%xMaSterKeef420bluntNinjAx> It took me a few hours to run through Honest Hearts LUL
[0:22:13] <OldManDeckardCain> fallout 4 is still not good LUL
[0:22:13] <Davimotion96> It's still not good
[0:22:13] <%HotSauceFiend> what are you tal;king about
[0:22:14] <%JamesCorck> Fallout 4 was a letdown.
[0:22:14] <kingmemelord97> WAIT NO DONT BLAST ME FOR THAT
[0:22:16] <@Lion_kun> Fallout 4 was never good
[0:22:17] <cs0402196> no
[0:22:17] <%Order_of_Mystery> something something, Bed Hive™
[0:22:19] <ergulor> oN
[0:22:20] <%Axellogic> I have no context I just got here why is no
[0:22:20] <%hewlettfan96> No it isn’t a LIE
[0:22:23] <TioXyco> fallout 4 was bad at launch, and it still is bad
[0:22:28] <%JusTTheGuyYouNeed> Fallout 4 is okay
[0:22:28] <%Monkeyweed21> FALLOUT 4 WASNT GOOD UNTIL FAR HARBOR
[0:22:35] <%MidnightBurst12> @kingmemelord97 LUL
[0:22:35] <%za7az> @kingmemelord97 Get wrecked LUL
[0:22:36] <Sterski> Fallout 4 had decent shooting and bad everything else
[0:22:36] <%solracc25> InFamous 2 DLC does that Pat.
[0:22:36] <%JamesCorck> New Vegas has some of the best DLC and some of the worst DLC.
[0:22:44] <%JamesCorck> Blood Money was garbage.
[0:22:45] <stantheman_97> it was and he's right
[0:22:52] <doctor_be> Bear, Bull, Bear, Bull
[0:22:55] <@QueequegTheater> Then you get to Lonesome Road and the author actively ruins all your choices in New Vegas
[0:22:56] <%JamesCorck> The Spanish version of Blood Money was fucked up.
[0:22:57] <MiamiMemory> At least you can make actual choices in New Vegas.
[0:23:02] <%PocketBearIllustrator> let's face it, the only good thing Bethesda has is iD and the recent DOOM games.
[0:23:02] <%YakumoYomi> That sounds like Skyrim on PS3
[0:23:10] <%hewlettfan96> @jamescorck Fallout 4 was always great what u on about
[0:23:11] <doctor_be> Blood money was great as a story and horrible as a bethesda fallout game
[0:23:12] <%shurtal> bleurgh
[0:23:13] <artoflec> Gerstmann is that guy that loves Yoshi's Island right
[0:23:17] <Sterski> Sounds like playing anything on my PC
[0:23:18] <%HotSauceFiend> ITS STILL JANK AS HELL
[0:23:19] <ergulor> i liked witcher 1
[0:23:20] <%Mr_Pylon> Mass Effect 3
[0:23:21] <%crimsonharvest> i beat both witcher 1 versions it was HELL
[0:23:21] <%PocketBearIllustrator> and Elder Scrolls online
[0:23:22] <%JamesCorck> The Spanish version of Blood Money left you at 1 HP when the fireworks went off at the casino, and you couldn't recover health.
[0:23:23] <%JoshManVGH> So what you're saying is NOW is the time to play The Outer Worlds?
[0:23:24] <OldManDeckardCain> witcher 1 almost fried my pc at launch
[0:23:24] <joebelieves> Now that’s crazy talk
[0:23:25] <dandy_thimble> Every Fallout game is bad on launch and post-launch forever
[0:23:25] <+ThomasOfTroy> Speaking of going back to play games after they've been patched and expanded, just look at pat's experience with mass effect
[0:23:27] <Flame_Water> We need a new Deus Ex game
[0:23:27] <cochramd1992> fug you Pat, Witcher 1 is still great
[0:23:28] <ELkasle> what about Fallout 76, when will it be good?
[0:23:29] <%RealThiele> oh god witcher 1 is still awful nowadays
[0:23:29] <%Monkeyweed21> I got Skyrim on ps3 at first
[0:23:30] <Visorak6> But its a PLAYABLE fucked up game for crazy people
[0:23:31] <@QueequegTheater> YUP
[0:23:35] <draca23> Witcher 3 was a fucked up mess at launch and became something far better later.
[0:23:35] <%HotSauceFiend> Oh thats a good one
[0:23:35] <@QueequegTheater> THERE IT IS
[0:23:38] <SaltyAzteca> Perfect
[0:23:38] <Jetsfantasy> FeelsBadMan
[0:23:41] <%peyodogo> and you STILL get special eyes
[0:23:42] <kingmemelord97> @Monkeyweed21 yeah nuka world was the only good fallout dlc ive played
[0:23:42] <%Rutta8> completely
[0:23:43] <+NeonNobleKalzeria> launch ME3 makes me sad
[0:23:44] <Coystick> They give it to you for FREE. They give you a COMPLIMENTRY Wicther with Gog
[0:23:45] <doctor_be> Fallout 76 is worth the time if you get it on sale
[0:23:51] <+PatchTheSquid> Speaking of, That witcher cartoon on Netflix is pretty alright.
[0:23:53] <%jtdobyns> yah feel sorry for those who played ME3 on release
[0:23:53] <%AncelDeLambert> it is not, and has never been "great"
[0:23:57] <OldManDeckardCain> witcher 1 is the best witcher game and one of the best rpgs
[0:23:57] <%optimasmaximas> LUL
[0:24:00] <xeros720> witcher 1 is weird as hell
[0:24:02] <%RealThiele> LUL delusional
[0:24:03] <Tracazoid> Witcher 1 defines Eurojank
[0:24:03] <%crimsonharvest> it controls the same as nwn tho
[0:24:05] <@MistyMntns> omg my stream keep skipping
[0:24:06] <AthenaAegis> Witcher 1 is SUPER Eurojank
[0:24:08] <wolfen091> so by pats standards, he should just be getting to morrowind about now
[0:24:08] <Flame_Water> ill play witcher 1 any day over 2 3
[0:24:09] <topiodonk> i liked it more than witcher 2 tbh
[0:24:09] <%HotSauceFiend> That combat system was rough in Witcher 1, 3 sword styles threw me off big time
[0:24:10] <+ThomasOfTroy> Witcher 1 is a GREAT game that is the literally EPITOME of eurojank
[0:24:12] <Bulagne> Witcher 1 is beautiful, beautiful slavjank
[0:24:12] <ergulor> true
[0:24:13] <%Ipsenscastle> it's a bizarre alien game
[0:24:14] <kingmemelord97> @doctor_be free on game pass
[0:24:15] <doctor_be> fallout 76's world is too well, someone clearly cared, but got shafted
[0:24:16] <%AyotoCorp> ME3 isn't that different from release, it still has a colorblind-unfriendly ending
[0:24:17] <@Lion_kun> I beat Witcher 1, the game barely functions
[0:24:17] <+unhuggable1> its gruesome to see
[0:24:21] <AMDBR9S> witcher 1 is better than 3
[0:24:21] <%JamesCorck> @hewlettfan96 I played it, couldn't get into it, then tried it again and fell through the floor on the starting area, all the time. I gave up after that.
[0:24:21] <TenraiDaze> W1 > W3
[0:24:23] <%Mr_Pylon> that's what you get when you mod Neverwinter Nights 2 to make your game
[0:24:23] <%Bluwizard21> will you play it on stream?
[0:24:24] <%Dopamien> NotLikeThis im so confused
[0:24:24] <%machshop> chapter 2 tho
[0:24:26] <Sterski> Of course you do
[0:24:27] <draca23> Gothic is amazing, but that game is made for crazy people.
[0:24:30] <%AncelDeLambert> I played ten minutes of Witcher 1, if that
[0:24:31] <MiamiMemory> @PatStaresAt  Have you watched Joseph Anderson's analysis of The Witcher series on Youtube?
[0:24:31] <+ThomasOfTroy> @AyotoCorp LUL
[0:24:32] <cochramd1992> I mean yeah, controls could be better but the combat is fun and that storyline though
[0:24:32] <%g0atmeal> Witcher 1 is the only game I've ever dropped in under 30min
[0:24:32] <%Ipsenscastle> it's fascinating and strange
[0:24:34] <@ssjklyco> Playing Persona 3 on release and P3P now
[0:24:35] <+unhuggable1> the walking animation alone is just....
[0:24:36] <@Lion_kun> You fought with left clicks and right clicks lol
[0:24:36] <doctor_be> boobie cards as well
[0:24:37] <%PocketBearIllustrator> so the ME3 is a better or worse experience nowadays.
[0:24:40] <+MisterAvry> which game?
[0:24:41] <%TIME_PUNCHER> haha pat called himself crazy
[0:24:42] <+Catpurnicus> so are you playing Prey with KB+M on PC or console version with a controller
[0:24:42] <@QueequegTheater> @PatStaresAt I've been playing Nioh 2 is there literally any situation where High stance is not the best
[0:24:42] <artoflec> act 2 is a slog yeah but every chapter before and after is great
[0:24:44] <%jtdobyns> I just watched a story summary on YouTube before Playing witcher 2
[0:24:45] <mattymcfilth> i am no where near ready to try baldurs gate when it comes out of early access IF IT EVER DOES
[0:24:45] <Sterski> what's good about it
[0:24:46] <Profmcstevie> I love you my weird screaming child with 3 hands
[0:24:46] <doctor_be> weird sex cards
[0:24:47] <%JamesCorck> Witcher 1's menu was a nightmare.
[0:24:48] <%Ches_Neckbeard> this crazy person is correct in his assessment of Witcher 1
[0:24:52] <ELkasle> @doctor_be I recently played a bit of Fallout 76. Its not bad as long as you dont expect it to be awesome
[0:24:53] <@GeneralSCPatton> Having my first real playthrough of Skyrim be excessively modded is pure dread. The saves will corrupt long before I make any significant progress.
[0:24:54] <%Monkeyweed21> the combat is a rhythm game with no rhythm
[0:24:54] <%MrMegaJackpots> MrMegaJackpots subscribed with Prime. They've subscribed for 10 months! So excited to see you play mooncrash. it's my favorite arcane game and I love the zapping system they use
[0:24:54] <$Mekhet09> I hate this post patch release culture.
[0:24:55] <joebelieves> Without Witcher 1, there wouldn’t be the franchise it is today woolieMIRIN
[0:25:00] <%optimasmaximas> @ssjklyco fes stroy....
[0:25:01] <doctor_be> did you play DnD 3.5 at all pat?
[0:25:03] <+Mrbaconator> im excited for when wrath of the righteous is done
[0:25:10] <draca23> SAME HERE
[0:25:18] <%PocketBearIllustrator> also, playing Skyward Sword back on Wii is VERY different from playing it on Switch.
[0:25:21] <%Mr_Pylon> Even Disco Elysium has this problem in a specific way, but on more of a content side
[0:25:26] <+Thyzoon> Kenshi?
[0:25:31] <+ThomasOfTroy> I just wait to buy games until they're cheaper anyway, so I'm always like 2-3 years behind on the latest games
[0:25:31] <topiodonk> did you play the first pathfinder? it good?
[0:25:32] <draca23> Most anticipated CRPG of the year, but I won't touch it until at least the first post game expansion comes out.
[0:25:34] <%JamesCorck> Pat after you finish Mass Effect 3, check out how was the original ending before the DLC and the extended ending were added. It's nuts.
[0:25:35] <chicken_apostle> Old games are fucked up
[0:25:39] <rambling_madman> please no one spoiler the Mooncrash characters to pat
[0:25:40] <%RealThiele> Disco did need a huge update yeah
[0:25:46] <%solracc25> No Mans Sky
[0:25:50] <doctor_be> I dont blame pat for bouncing off kenshi hard
[0:25:51] <%ChrisPlaysThing> The fan mod that fixes the garbage
[0:25:53] <wolfen091> the fuck is elder scrolls, its just skyrim now
[0:25:58] <%spitelite> just wait 10 years to play skyrim
[0:25:59] <+tigerfang86> lol
[0:26:00] <KosOrSomeSayKosm_> yeeeeeeeeeeeah
[0:26:01] <@QueequegTheater> Or even Legendary
[0:26:02] <%machshop> @Thyzoon kenshi is like the definition of crazy person game
[0:26:09] <+tigerfang86> but also I've never played a skyrim so
[0:26:09] <%RealThiele> Kenshi cursed his computer that shit was great
[0:26:10] <artoflec> @QueequegTheater in my experience, it burns so much stamina that if you get tapped by a Gaki then you're opened to getting OHKO'd from no stamina state artofl1St
[0:26:13] <Coystick> They patched in extra main story elements to Deadfire later for free because the original plot was so incoherent
[0:26:14] <+unhuggable1> OOF
[0:26:15] <%g0atmeal> Still haven't played it, idk if I ever will
[0:26:15] <Profmcstevie> Being late to the party can do WONDERS
[0:26:16] <+ThomasOfTroy> I have 120 hours in Skyrim and I've never gotten more than like 15% done with it
[0:26:17] <%Broand> Skyrim kills all my excitement for future elderscrolls games
[0:26:17] <%Ipsenscastle> same
[0:26:19] <joebelieves> Are you ready for SKYBLIVION?????
[0:26:22] <@QueequegTheater> @artoflec But big damage tho
[0:26:23] <TioXyco> I never played skyrim, should I play skyrim? HELL NO! have some decency.
[0:26:25] <%hewlettfan96> But that’s old news though
[0:26:25] <%Mr_Pylon> I played a version where every Dragon would die in mid flight due to nothing
[0:26:26] <%retrohazard> How to pick from the 200 versions of Skyrim available
[0:26:27] <+unhuggable1> damn.. played on PC
[0:26:28] <%Monkeyweed21> I had ps3 lol
[0:26:29] <topiodonk> i played the ps3 one, i think thats the worst one right?
[0:26:30] <%SuckerPunchSyd> Saaaaame
[0:26:30] <%Broand> because it's a constant feeling of "it's gonna get fun" but it never does
[0:26:31] <$Mekhet09> Skyrim is also like a one time game. I don't think anyone can play it multiple times.
[0:26:34] <%TIME_PUNCHER> fucken 3 generations old
[0:26:35] <draca23> Yeah....Vanilla 360 Skyrim was fucking trash compared to Oblivion even to some extent.
[0:26:37] <%Pappajimbo> giant moon launch was funny
[0:26:39] <+ThomasOfTroy> The 500 mods, ye
[0:26:41] <%MidnightBurst12> ps3 version was fucked
[0:26:42] <%hewlettfan96> They’re all the same
[0:26:42] <Dunmarkh> LIARS
[0:26:43] <+rafaelba93> fallout 3 on ps3 was worse
[0:26:44] <%spitelite> i remember playing on the ps3 version and waiting forever to play the dlc's
[0:26:44] <@commanderclaw> 500 bits of Creation Club shit
[0:26:44] <doctor_be> Skyrim still had some of the old morrowind story style, it was just hidden under alot of crap
[0:26:46] <%JusTTheGuyYouNeed> I played the Ps3 that was like super horrible
[0:26:47] <artoflec> @QueequegTheater it IS big fat damage for sure, also some of the coolest looking moves are off high stance lol
[0:26:47] <%Ipsenscastle> the PS3 version just stopped working after a certain amount of time played
[0:26:47] <%Order_of_Mystery> I can't wait for a future where we can selectively remove all knowledge and memory of specific games. I'd so love to re-play Skyrim for the first time again
[0:26:48] <%gustavozxd> I played skyrim and was strongly bored by literally everything
[0:26:49] <Coystick> Why would you pay for Skyrim with preinstalled mods?
[0:26:52] <Dunmarkh> They're not mods
[0:26:55] <@MistyMntns> Fishing
[0:26:57] <%Pukenasty> backwards flying dragons that shit was rough
[0:26:58] <+ArbitraryHubris> lol, I've definitely played skyrim more than one time
[0:26:59] <xeros720> a shit ton of creation club shit, whatever that amounts to
[0:27:02] <DavidSanChan> when's skyrim coming to GTA 5
[0:27:02] <anAngryHamster> If you bought Skyrim on launch you had it coming
[0:27:08] <Dunmarkh> motherfuckers playing telephone
[0:27:09] <ELkasle> @gustavozxd IKR tes Oblivion is way better
[0:27:09] <%hewlettfan96> PS4 or above is the only way
[0:27:14] <theloganbrand> A ton of extra quests
[0:27:15] <BinaryBetrayer> Isn't that fishing mod a mod they stole from a guy and implement as a feature?
[0:27:15] <ianabstract> If the anniversary edition doesn't include the community bugfix patch what are they even doing
[0:27:15] <%Axellogic> 500 creation club additions
[0:27:20] <%solracc25> Release Skyrim was effed up to hell on PS3. I have a dragon corpse stuck in Whiterun
[0:27:23] <%PocketBearIllustrator> I'm surprised there are still people who play Skyrim on anything other than PC. The mods are basically the main attraction.
[0:27:24] <doctor_be> creation club stuff is curated by bethesda so it isnt too fucked up
[0:27:26] <%MidnightBurst12> saves had a memory corruption issue after a while
[0:27:27] <+ThomasOfTroy> New weapons and quests too
[0:27:30] <+ArbitraryHubris> skyrim is by far the best game on my toaster
[0:27:32] <Coystick> You can just mod in what's already preinstalled though, you're paying for less control
[0:27:32] <@Spydurman> Pat when's the Skyrim Smartfridge stream?
[0:27:35] <+Thyzoon> oh it's just cc stuff
[0:27:37] <KosOrSomeSayKosm_> I think it is
[0:27:41] <%RealThiele> "club"
[0:27:41] <%deviljhojho_> ah man prey is solid. Kinda boring monster design tho
[0:27:43] <+ThomasOfTroy> It's a free update for current owners I think, isn't it?
[0:27:44] <%TIME_PUNCHER> Creation Club is the EGS of Nexus Mods
[0:27:45] <Dunmarkh> There are only 48 pieces of creation club content, that 500 number is meaningless
[0:27:53] <BoxFaceStar> Hi Pato!
[0:27:55] <%gustavozxd> that makes sense
[0:27:57] <doctor_be> Have you played Kingmaker?
[0:28:04] <%Monkeyweed21> @TIME_PUNCHER thats really good
[0:28:08] <%Dopamien> damn FeelsBadMan
[0:28:08] <sealbop> What’s up y’all
[0:28:10] <joebelieves> 10 years from now, it’ll be re-released as Skyrim: Directors Cut
[0:28:11] <%BinaryFireball> dude its already "out"
[0:28:12] <OldManDeckardCain> skyrim super special edition was fun for like 5 minutes
[0:28:12] <%deviljhojho_> when is baldur's supposed to come out anyways
[0:28:15] <+ThomasOfTroy> 3-year-old game gang preach
[0:28:15] <ape_hawk> yeah, im not even playing bg3 NOW
[0:28:19] <+PatchTheSquid> Didn't it technically come out and get put back?
[0:28:19] <DavidSanChan> spend the 3 years rolling perfect stats
[0:28:22] <%machshop> then you can benefit from chat backseating LUL
[0:28:25] <doctor_be> Soon (tm)
[0:28:27] <+rafaelba93> nice call, I will adopt that aproach
[0:28:32] <TioXyco> @joebeilieves god no...
[0:28:36] <wolfen091> yeah right, you'll get bored then ask if its okay on twitter then do it, you did it with wasteland 3
[0:28:36] <bob900000> what if it's good on launch
[0:28:39] <draca23> Baldurs Gate 3 seems so boring to me, for some reason.
[0:28:39] <%HotSauceFiend> are you gonna touch Elden Ring day 1?
[0:28:43] <%deviljhojho_> content, or enjoyment?
[0:28:44] <%crimsonharvest> wont be hard to keep it stream exclusive at least
[0:28:45] <%deviljhojho_> the eternal dilema
[0:28:45] <%Retinolgaming> Buy it to support devs, then backburner it till its done.
[0:28:46] <@QueequegTheater> LUL
[0:28:48] <TioXyco> we know it's probably gonna suck LUL
[0:28:49] <%RealThiele> "it just works!"
[0:28:49] <%moonmintparadise> yeah make that money
[0:28:50] <stantheman_97> one-off stream?
[0:28:52] <artificiallynatural> wait for the lover's labs mod to come out
[0:28:52] <+ThomasOfTroy> Don't stream, I won't get to watch it
[0:28:53] <%JoshManVGH> Didn't Destiny 1 get really good about the time they stopped producing DLC for it?
[0:28:53] <draca23> And I loved D:OS2.
[0:28:56] <Profmcstevie> Stream Morrorwind on it's release
[0:28:57] <BinaryBetrayer> The curse of content
[0:29:00] <%BallerSwagBro9k> But Baldurs Gate 3 is in early access so the release will much more final than a usual 1.0

[0:29:22] <Coystick> That's life flim fam
[0:29:26] <BoxFaceStar> I mean, you can play the new elder scrolls whenever it launches and when it inevitably is FUCKED you can just drop it for a couple years
[0:29:28] <draca23> That and Tales of Arise seems like an unbridled mess, tbh
[0:29:28] <joebelieves> So when’s the Cyberpunk playthrough????
[0:29:31] <Flame_Water> great question
[0:29:32] <doctor_be> have you ever seen how expensive yarn is?
[0:29:32] <Zero_Jacks> she was doing nice with the violin
[0:29:34] <+ThomasOfTroy> Mommy Milker Legos
[0:29:34] <+kewlmyc> I though it was violin bit was neat enough. Also that's every hobby

[0:29:35] <DavidSanChan> top tier looms
[0:29:37] <+PatchTheSquid> Bruh. Lindsey Sterling is tight, why is that what they are complaining about? of all the stupid crap they showed. thats what you picked?!

[0:29:49] <+ArbitraryHubris> corsair knitting needles are crap

[0:31:22] <%TheLakinessMonster> TheLakinessMonster subscribed at Tier 3. They've subscribed for 12 months! Fun fact, Hades has an Italian dub but not a Greek dub. It's the one thing keeping me from calling it a perfect game.
[0:31:25] <+ArbitraryHubris> it's expensive to buy babies
[0:31:32] <%ChrisPlaysThing> "it's only 1% lead"
[0:31:37] <cochramd1992> why use formula, you literally grow milk in your tits
[0:31:38] <Arisato_II> Baby review when?
[0:31:39] <%JamesCorck> Here's my honest review of the Nintendo Switch, but first let me tell you about the Sponsor of this video, Nintendo.
[0:31:45] <%Treuan> You want to see your baby live past 5? Better buy gerber!
[0:31:45] <%gustavozxd> everyone's mom's fault
[0:31:52] <%ChrisPlaysThing> you could if you wanted to
[0:31:54] <Madovir> well why not?
[0:31:55] <+ThomasOfTroy> That's for a lack of trying Pat
[0:31:56] <smallheals> you grow redbull in your tits

[0:33:50] <%kingmemelord97> cant wait for the remake
[0:33:50] <chhdez> Man I tried to replay Prey and it glitched on me right on the "Go to the main lobby" objective
[0:33:54] <%Mr_Pylon> Oh yeah Outer Wilds feels goodbad
[0:33:56] <%ChrisPlaysThing> Subnautica is so anxiety inducing
[0:33:59] <joebelieves> You gonna play star Citizen?
[0:34:00] <%Dopamien> cries in kerbal space program
[0:34:02] <@QueequegTheater> @PatStaresAt How did Subnautica's underwater movement feel when you played it
[0:34:04] <SaltyAzteca> Entering Zero Gravity is just GOOD
[0:34:12] <draca23> Its eerie when you kill what was normally loud monsters be super silent in space.
[0:34:12] <%BinaryFireball> there was a multiplayer astronaut FPS where you shot motherfuckers in astroid fields and there was no "up"
[0:34:15] <%crimsonharvest> outer wilds is alright too, but if you dont know what a velocity vector is you'll suffer
[0:34:17] <%BallerSwagBro9k> The quiet is super unsettling
[0:34:18] <%blaggablag> There was this multiplayer shooter that came out like ten years ago, Shattered Horizon, that did that super well
[0:34:23] <Profmcstevie> How much wood could a woodchuck
[0:34:27] <Tisaric> Subnautica's movement is pretty great as well
[0:34:27] <doctor_be> Thalassaphobia: The Game
[0:34:28] <%gustavozxd> subnautica is fucking scary
[0:34:33] <%Buzzard42> That is the intended feeling of Subnautica
[0:34:35] <%MidnightBurst12> as it should
[0:34:40] <@QueequegTheater> That's too bad, it's a great game, but anxiety gonna anxiety
[0:34:41] <%crimsonharvest> well you can see the reapers coming in space
[0:34:43] <%JamesCorck> It's because Space can be brighter than the ocean.
[0:34:44] <Tracazoid> Just imagine space sharks
[0:34:44] <%MidnightBurst12> it's scary
[0:34:47] <%RonaldMcDownload> Ocean is more plausible to actually happen
[0:34:47] <+rafaelba93> water is scary
[0:34:47] <Tisaric> I fucking love the anxiety you get from Subnautica's world
[0:34:47] <Latija> space? you mean night
[0:34:47] <%BinaryFireball> @blaggablag  think thats what im thinking of
[0:34:49] <+Thyzoon> Do you have Thalassaphobia?
[0:34:50] <artificiallynatural> cuz stuff live in ocean
[0:34:50] <Madovir> there's no mystery to space
[0:34:51] <+Freakin_Wolfy> I assume because the Ocean has a "floor" but you can't touch it. The same reason the shallow end of pools scares you
[0:34:51] <%DianaTheAscian> @PatStaresAt y ocean?
[0:34:51] <@Spydurman> it's not an ocean, it's just a big pool
[0:34:51] <+Redeyes_NI> Outer Wilds dark bramble is ocean fear in space
[0:34:52] <+MisterAvry> but space is truly bottomless
[0:34:52] <doctor_be> Space is huge, there are literally millions of miles between things
[0:34:53] <bob900000> that thing paige dosent believe in
[0:34:53] <BepBepAmShep> I know a number of people that feel the same way
[0:34:54] <%Dopamien> well yea space isn't real Kappa
[0:34:54] <SaltyAzteca> You cant drown in space 4Head
[0:34:55] <%ChrisPlaysThing> It's hearing the giant mother fuckers that gets me
[0:34:55] <%JamesCorck> The ocean is bright, when you're close to the surface.
[0:34:55] <+Delenay> weight of the water
[0:34:55] <%PlainSimpleTailor> More things can maunch on you in the sea
[0:34:56] <%Axellogic> is it cause ocean is water but space is empty?
[0:34:57] <+PatchTheSquid> We need more Nautical themed horror games
[0:34:57] <doctor_be> the ocean is FULL Of stuff
[0:34:57] <OldManDeckardCain> mako tsunami cring in the distance
[0:34:57] <%gustavozxd> I literally couldn't play subnautica because of fear, never happened with any other game
[0:34:57] <Profmcstevie> haha murky water deep ocean
[0:34:59] <%SaiyanShoto> The ocean is way scarier than space
[0:34:59] <joebelieves> Should be called subnauticphobia
[0:34:59] <%Buzzard42> Subnautica is very specifically preying on the innate fear of the deep
[0:35:00] <sirrice77> well space is mostly empty, the deep ocean is not
[0:35:02] <%Ipsenscastle> ocean has lower visibility

[0:35:04] <@QueequegTheater> I say again, young man
[0:35:05] <ItIsSky> Going anywhere too far in subnautica gives me a lot of anxiety
[0:35:05] <chhdez> Pat hates the ocean an d Paige refuses to believe in space
[0:35:06] <%RealThiele> ocean has real monsters
[0:35:06] <%blaggablag> Also Kerbal Space Program for entirely different reasons
[0:35:07] <%SuckerPunchSyd> You can be eaten in the ocean not so much in space
[0:35:07] <%JamesCorck> No thanks.
[0:35:10] <cs0402196> space has always been there, but things Evolved to eat you in the ocean
[0:35:11] <tengel66> the Orphan of Kos is in there
[0:35:13] <%tempestzephyr> you must welcome the dark wet embrace of the sea mother
[0:35:14] <+unhuggable1> scary giant spider-octopus lives in the deep ocean

[0:35:17] <+polothegreatest> asmr: deep ocean
[0:35:18] <stantheman_97> i didn't understand people's fear of the open ocean until i played subnautica
[0:35:19] <+PatchTheSquid> Correction; we need more good Nautical themed horror games.
[0:35:20] <%BallerSwagBro9k> @patstaresat U might wanna check out Below Zero, its less scary
[0:35:21] <wolfen091> barbers
[0:35:23] <smallheals> Arent you afraid of the big nighttime though
[0:35:24] <joebelieves> The ocean is flat
[0:35:24] <%hewlettfan96> Cheer500 Pat i simply dont agree to waiting potentially months/years amount of time for eventual patches, yeah we all agree that Major RPGs such as Witcher and Skyrim were glitchy af but that’s part of the charm I feel, you always gotta grind in huge games like that, also Final fantasy 6 is best FF, also all that monster can’t be good for your bowels psaWrong
[0:35:24] <%solracc25> Space is empty, the ocean is not @patstaresat
[0:35:25] <Arisato_II> You're still a young man, Pat
[0:35:28] <xanerts> because space isnt real but the ocean is
[0:35:30] <cinless> space empty, ocean not
[0:35:36] <%JoshManVGH> Space has so many risks that are invisible or quick. Underwater seems like it's all slow and painful.
[0:35:38] <TioXyco> @solracc25 is it?
[0:35:41] <%ChrisPlaysThing> Scampy?
[0:35:42] <%DianaTheAscian> I love the deep ocean its all weird I love it
[0:35:43] <zhenthrim213> @tengel66 just screaming at everything
[0:35:45] <+ThomasOfTroy> Ocean is constant crushing pressure, space is the absence of such pressure. The ocean feels more active and therefore more threatening. It makes sense

[0:35:54] <%Order_of_Mystery> "Multiple reaper-class leviathans detected. Are you sure whatever you're doing is a good idea?" ~quote from Subnautica that gave me a panic attack. 10/10 game
[0:35:55] <%RealThiele> Key memory obtained
[0:35:56] <@QueequegTheater> @BallerSwagBro9k He was getting anxiety in the safe shallows zone, I don't think the new setting will help much
[0:35:57] <%JamesCorck> Subnautica plays to three fears: The fear of darkness, the fear of dark spaces, and the fear of not knowing you have a reaper leviathan ready to turn you into ribbons.

[0:39:49] <%mads_valentine> TIME STOP
[0:39:49] <@QueequegTheater> @PatStaresAt Jolyne is just better Part 2 Joseph
[0:39:50] <%solracc25> saw blades of old were, unsafe
[0:39:51] <%machshop> or maybe Diego
[0:39:51] <%kingmemelord97> @DocMadfox i guess i am
[0:39:52] <draca23> Dio Over Heaven
[0:39:52] <+geistuser> how scary is prey? i want to play it but i hate horror games
[0:39:54] <bob900000> part 4 Joseph
[0:39:55] <%Bluwizard21> if dio had a kart he could change into another player to avoid player speicfic attacks
[0:39:55] <+ThomasOfTroy> joseph is still my favorite
[0:39:57] <%Mr_Pylon> Speed Wagon
[0:39:58] <stantheman_97> part 3 joseph could too
[0:39:58] <SkinnyRite> A jojo kart racer would ults
[0:39:59] <%Monkeyweed21> Dio's Head in the DannyMoblie
[0:39:59] <topiodonk> he would just scream nigerundayo and get a boost
[0:40:00] <wolfen091> Speedwagon cause plane
[0:40:06] <@QueequegTheater> She's prison Spider-Man
[0:40:08] <%jinking79> Part 8 Joseph
[0:40:10] <%MidnightBurst12> and it would be bullshit
[0:40:11] <%megadblitz> he would ride that zombie cart
[0:40:14] <SaltyAzteca> Killer Queen has already touched this speed ramp
[0:40:15] <Profmcstevie> Heart Attack has already drifted that corner
[0:40:17] <%crimsonharvest> @geistuser its more tension than fear
[0:40:20] <SeanPrime22> on the topic of cool zero g shit, honestly I really dug the low gravity areas in Lawbreakers (cuz I was one of like 100 people that actually played and liked that game). basically you could move around a bit on your own, but the main thing you were supposed to do was press ctrl to shoot your gun behind you and use the force of it firing to propel yourself forward. it was actually fuckin sick
[0:40:21] <%Dopamien> Jolyne is the first strand type jojo char
[0:40:21] <%CoffeeKaiju> a fine answer thanku
[0:40:21] <doctor_be> Morrowind barely came together
[0:40:23] <DSD24> Morrowind is super cool
[0:40:24] <%Treasure_Vault> Morrowind is fucking weird masterpiece
[0:40:24] <joebelieves> Part 0 Joseph
[0:40:25] <%Ipsenscastle> same
[0:40:26] <%big_boss_baby> Same
[0:40:27] <%cooldude69xx> Thats literally a move Scorpion got in the Mortal Kombat kart racer
[0:40:29] <%Bluwizard21> is skywind still coming?
[0:40:29] <%crimsonharvest> then you get a minor jumpscare
[0:40:30] <xeros720> god yeah, morrowind was something else
[0:40:31] <%LordSDB> @PocketBearIllustrator  TY my dude
[0:40:32] <Djinnazz> I'm I the only one that couldn't stand Moorwwind?
[0:40:32] <BinaryBetrayer> It's too archaic now
[0:40:33] <@ssjklyco> It looks like shit now
[0:40:35] <%PocketBearIllustrator> is it just me or is Part 2 Joseph and Part 3 Joseph seem lily two completely different characters?
[0:40:38] <%blaggablag> It's a sort of cultural touchstone of the genre
[0:40:41] <%Meekest> Persona 2
[0:40:41] <Coystick> System Shock is another one
[0:40:48] <draca23> Morrowind is AMAZING but TERRIBLE
[0:40:48] <%Treasure_Vault> Miss when you attack?
[0:40:49] <supergoblinpunch> Yeah that's rough to play today.
[0:40:50] <DSD24> The combat is weird
[0:40:50] <%PocketBearIllustrator> @lordsdb no prob, Bob
[0:40:50] <%Treasure_Vault> Uhh oh
[0:40:51] <+Thyzoon> @PatStaresAt Just wait for Skywind Pat, that's what I'm doing.
[0:40:52] <@QueequegTheater> @PatStaresAt Shooters before CoD/Halo
[0:40:57] <%hewlettfan96> Mirrorwind is a bizarre masterpiece
[0:40:58] <Djinnazz> HATED THAT
[0:41:01] <DSD24> I hit the enemy "No you didn't"
[0:41:03] <%Archphronimos> there are mods to fix that...
[0:41:03] <@SoFarFetched> @pocketbearillustrator  wait until you see part 4 Joseph Kappa
[0:41:03] <%big_boss_baby> also the lack of fast travel
[0:41:05] <%Bluwizard21> @PatStaresAt you can patch that out. also skywind
[0:41:05] <%Mr_Pylon> I looking forward to 10 years from now when Skywind is done.
[0:41:05] <KosOrSomeSayKosm_> like going back to a monster hunter game before the jumping/climbing was good
[0:41:05] <joebelieves> Soooooo Kotor??
[0:41:07] <%Treasure_Vault> Skywind?
[0:41:09] <@GeneralSCPatton> Isn't there a mod for that?
[0:41:09] <%kingmemelord97> wait reallly ?
[0:41:10] <%cobalt_phoenix_> wait what
[0:41:11] <%VHGS> Just be a wizard lmao
[0:41:11] <%Order_of_Mystery> Morrowind is still relevant. thanks to Wabbajack, you can click one button and make the game playable and great, @PatStaresAt
[0:41:12] <Coystick> It's fine just level your weapon skill and drink fatigue potions, it's easy
[0:41:14] <+polothegreatest> todd actually convinced me to buy skyrim, it just took him this long
[0:41:15] <Profmcstevie> *miss* well fuck you
[0:41:15] <xeros720> i argue you can still play it, but you gotta be ready for it since it plays like baldur's gate 1 and deus ex
[0:41:18] <ELkasle> and thats why we wait for morrowind mod for skyrim for 10 years now
[0:41:18] <BinaryBetrayer> Commence the dump of all those morrowind combat dot gifs
[0:41:20] <doctor_be> Lack of fast travel actually can be a point in its favor
[0:41:24] <+vaderxyz1970> I played Morrowind when I was 4 so I didn't get into it but I was old enough to understand Oblivion when it came out
[0:41:24] <%peyodogo> can you like cheat to push the accuracy super high or something
[0:41:26] <%BallerSwagBro9k> do it tho
[0:41:31] <stantheman_97> so you hit them and the game just goes "lol no"
[0:41:31] <doctor_be> there was fast travel, but you had to actually navigate
[0:41:31] <%Treasure_Vault> Just break yourself infinitely powerful in one of like twelve ways
[0:41:31] <Dunmarkh> @GeneralSCPatton yeah but that breaks the game balance really hard
[0:41:31] <+AWanderingKenku> That's why I used mods to remove that
[0:41:32] <%PocketBearIllustrator> @sofarfetched aw, jeez
[0:41:32] <%cooldude69xx> Dice rolls+Grid=Good Dice rolls+3D space=Awful Garbage
[0:41:35] <magictomcat> you could mod that out
[0:41:43] <%Axellogic> Oblvion came out when the idea of controller on PC was "its just a joystick right?"
[0:41:45] <%crimsonharvest> if you play Morrowind you have to realize you can't impose your will on it
[0:41:51] <%solracc25> RNJesus is at it again
[0:41:53] <%blankwaffle> did you ever try the unity remake of daggerfall? it kinda fixes that
[0:41:56] <Djinnazz> @joebeilieves KoToR you actaully did dmg most of the time., in Morrow wind you just wiff till the game says you didn't.
[0:41:57] <Coystick> Yeah who wants to be THOUGHTFUL in an RPG, just hook more Skyrim up to my veins.
[0:42:00] <@QueequegTheater> Thank you sir
[0:42:01] <rambling_madman> should've remade Morrowind in Skyrim engine over the last 10 years instead of this rerelease bullshit

[0:42:27] <+vaderxyz1970> Hobo Sir

[0:42:32] <rambling_madman> Sir is for Mobility Mary
[0:42:33] <$ItsRatman> Excuse me, Sir?

[0:42:36] <%Meekest> Theres no physical difference between you and that guy
[0:42:37] <%hewlettfan96> Ahh yes sir
[0:42:38] <xeros720> i've had people call me sir and i'm roughly the same age, i assumed it was because i had a dirty look on my face
[0:42:38] <SeanPrime22> when I'm at work I just refer to all men as sir
[0:42:38] <TioXyco> sir you use for people you don't know or you respect somehow,,, or if you don't want to be rude
[0:42:39] <awfully_crispy> Maybe it's because I grew up in south US, but "sir" is used for anyone male imo
[0:42:48] <%Ipsenscastle> hmm
[0:42:48] <awfully_crispy> They're probably cops
[0:42:49] <zhenthrim213> they arent
[0:42:49] <%Pappajimbo> yeah its a shame morrowind has the best lore chim chim charoo muthafackers
[0:42:54] <%SirGO0SE> thats some good trash man
[0:42:57] <%Agami23> i've been raised to call anyone asking me to do stuff "sir" or "ma'am".
[0:42:57] <zhenthrim213> they sell that shit
[0:42:58] <%flying_hipp0> WOW
[0:42:59] <doctor_be> Nothing beats, the hobo life, stabbin folks with my hobo knife
[0:43:01] <%ChrisPlaysThing> we have lots of druggies who need a fix
[0:43:03] <+gatdragon> Which prey is this?
[0:43:04] <Bonebagmel> It's free money!
[0:43:08] <+wmeldrum> ..totally...
[0:43:09] <%hewlettfan96> Sell it shite
[0:43:10] <ELkasle> undercover cop
[0:43:11] <%BallerSwagBro9k> Pat.......
[0:43:11] <draca23> They're not. Old people just want what they think is 'valuable' and hoard it.
[0:43:13] <awfully_crispy> They are investigating a murder and need to pay off their bills
[0:43:13] <%JoshManVGH> Some people have no limits on a nickel.
[0:43:14] <%kingmemelord97> why would cops dig through trash ?
[0:43:19] <%big_boss_baby> Most panhandlers aren't homeless either, it's just an easy way to make money if you have no pride
[0:43:24] <@QueequegTheater> Yeah I lived in downtown Chicago for long enough to recognize grifters.  Yeah buddy, you're homeless, that's why you're wearing pristine Chuck Taylors
[0:43:26] <xanerts> wow ok
[0:43:26] <%crimsonharvest> cops are explicitly allowed to lie to you
[0:43:26] <+vaderxyz1970> But what if though...
[0:43:28] <%jtdobyns> Nothing I hate more is fake homeless people.
[0:43:28] <Djinnazz> @gatdragon newest one.
[0:43:30] <+rasend0ri> Let’s get this party STARTED!!!!
[0:43:33] <+wmeldrum> yeah just reach in your pocket, then they'll tell you
[0:43:33] <@SoFarFetched> just like that "cop" in 12 minutes geefPlz
[0:43:35] <rambling_madman> YES THEY DO!!
[0:43:36] <%blaggablag> They totally are a cop
[0:43:37] <%solracc25> Señor, is basically any male stranger over the age of 27 in spanish
[0:43:38] <%JamesCorck> I learned that from The Wire.
[0:43:38] <%Garthunox> pat are you a cop?
[0:43:41] <%BallerSwagBro9k> Maybe they're HOBOCOPS
[0:43:41] <Madovir> why would a cop ever tell the truth
[0:43:42] <%Ches_Neckbeard> @kingmemelord97 now ask that in Dale Gribble voice and you'll get ansers
[0:43:43] <%big_boss_baby> If you try to kiss them and they turn away, that means they're a cop
[0:43:44] <%Pappajimbo> yeah that would be stupid for undercover
[0:43:46] <%PlainSimpleTailor> Never talk to the police
[0:43:46] <%hewlettfan96> Yeah they’re a cop
[0:43:46] <IntrepidEye> You'd be surprised how many "homeless" people have money but are cheap as FUCK so prefer digging through trash and panhandling instead of spending their own money
[0:43:47] <%cooldude69xx> Are you telling me the police lie?
[0:43:49] <doctor_be> Yeah, IS pat a cop?
[0:43:51] <%kingmemelord97> can confirm i am a cop
[0:43:52] <PanicSwytch> I don't know why ppl believe that LUL
[0:43:52] <@Spydurman> what do you do when cops come around? Shut the fuck up
[0:43:54] <%RealThiele> it means they are a lying cop
[0:43:55] <%BallerSwagBro9k> I've seen Breaking Bad 8 know
[0:43:56] <%JoshManVGH> @kingmemelord97 For anything they could use to make a case for Probable Cause.
[0:43:56] <+wolf34736> but movies
[0:43:56] <@QueequegTheater> Pat the Cop
[0:43:57] <+wmeldrum> @PatStaresAt  are YOU a cop??
[0:44:00] <%MechArch> they have to show you their weiner
[0:44:00] <%ChrisPlaysThing> There's that one lady at the charlevoix metro that follows people around saying "anything for 5$" pretty sure she's homeless
[0:44:02] <JetpackMcQuack> annd also you're under arrest
[0:44:03] <$DocMadfox> Always assume everyone's a cop
[0:44:05] <%unhuggable1> i mean if you HAVE to ask them...
[0:44:07] <+wmeldrum> see... he's a cop
[0:44:07] <awfully_crispy> dude cops love drugs

[0:44:09] <stantheman_97> if the say they're not a cop you can sell them drugs safely
[0:44:09] <%Ches_Neckbeard> Pat cop confirmed
[0:44:09] <$ItsRatman> What if I say im a cop but im not?
[0:44:11] <%Meekest> Sounds like what a cop would say
[0:44:11] <%za7az> HE'S A COP
[0:44:13] <%Ipsenscastle> cops routinely break into people's houses by pretending to be postmen and people from the gas board or whatever
[0:44:13] <TioXyco> learned from experience?
[0:44:14] <%MechArch> that way you'll now
[0:44:14] <%optimasmaximas> LUL
[0:44:14] <%Meekest> Cops LOVE drugs
[0:44:15] <SaltyAzteca> Thats what a cop would say!
[0:44:16] <OldManDeckardCain> I'm totally not an FBI agent... now to our insurrection plans...
[0:44:17] <+vaderxyz1970> What about people impersonation a cop
[0:44:17] <+Catpurnicus> sounds like something a cop would say
[0:44:20] <SaltyAzteca> HES A HOBO COP
[0:44:20] <@QueequegTheater> Pat's baby hands could never hold a Glock-19 properly
[0:44:22] <%Order_of_Mystery> you'd never use a needle, you fibber
[0:44:22] <Arisato_II> Hell yeah crack
[0:44:23] <$Mekhet09> Cops can get away with that.
[0:44:23] <ianabstract> If you think a druggie is actually a cop, check their teeth. Cops take care of their teeth, druggies don't
[0:44:23] <+dkujawa24> A cop would never lie to me
[0:44:24] <+redthebaron> CLASSIC COP STUFF
[0:44:25] <VirtuaRailith> Do orbs have to declare they are orbs? I don't want to be talking with an orb only to find out it was a tetrahedron
[0:44:26] <rambling_madman> E-crimes division
[0:44:27] <%JoshManVGH> Pat is a mountie confirmed.

[0:44:30] <+Thyzoon> uh oh
[0:44:32] <%blaggablag> He then proceeds to roll and smoke pure bacon

[0:48:14] <+Dova573> bioshock
[0:48:15] <KosOrSomeSayKosm_> honestly to me saying immersive sim reminds me of bus simulator, all of those are more of a bioshock deal

[0:48:32] <%MidnightBurst12> really?
[0:48:33] <TioXyco> what about BUS SIMULATOR?
[0:48:33] <xeros720> oh, i guess the Stalker games huh?
[0:48:34] <DSD24> Bioshock 2 is super arcady
[0:48:36] <@GeneralSCPatton> Steam's Immersive Sim tag is bullshit. They just slap it on any simulator.
[0:48:36] <+GuilKato> sos 0451 games + anything Simulator
[0:48:38] <Djinnazz> where's the SIM part come it?
[0:48:39] <%valriot> Bioshock kinda sucks
[0:48:41] <BinaryBetrayer> Bioshock Infinite is JUST a shooter
[0:48:43] <Tisaric> it's a scale from bioshock 1/2 to original deus ex basically
[0:48:44] <anAngryHamster> Human Revolution is not an immersive sim
[0:48:44] <%twistedj3ster> Infinite can die in a fire
[0:48:44] <DSD24> Bioshock Infinite is also bad
[0:48:46] <%solracc25> Flight simulators
[0:48:46] <PanicSwytch> Yeah i agree
[0:48:47] <%Treasure_Vault> If arcadey is one side, what's the other side of immersive sims?
[0:48:47] <%Garthunox> crazy taxi?
[0:48:48] <@commanderclaw> Infinite is a shitty shooter that thinks it's smarter than it is
[0:48:48] <awfully_crispy> Breath of the Wild is an immersive sim?
[0:48:49] <PlaidisTheNewPlaid> Viscera Clean-up Detail?
[0:48:50] <SirFailsAlott> might and magic fark messiah
[0:48:52] <JetpackMcQuack> Bioshock isn't that free
[0:48:54] <+Catpurnicus> like the first 5 minutes of infinite is, then it goes to shit
[0:48:55] <Coystick> They're consolzied Immersive Sims, like how Kotor is a consolized CRPG
[0:48:56] <%Broand> You fool, you opened the floodgates with truck simulator!
[0:48:56] <Tisaric> Or I guess System Shock 1/2 at the other end
[0:48:57] <+polothegreatest> bioshock is cool
[0:48:58] <%Bonte__> Would you say Burial at Sea was more Immersive Sim?
[0:48:58] <%Order_of_Mystery> you know what else Bioshock Infinite isn't? Good psaDab
[0:48:59] <DSD24> in the year 2000s!
[0:48:59] <%kingmemelord97> because booker talks ?
[0:48:59] <wolfen091> so a sim isn't an immersive sim but an rpg arcadey game is?  thats stupid
[0:49:00] <%RetroCop87> can a visual novel become an immersive sim?
[0:49:02] <KosOrSomeSayKosm_> OH THAT'S WHY
[0:49:02] <%crow114> crow114 subscribed at Tier 2. They've subscribed for 34 months! Almost 3 years of this
[0:49:06] <%crimsonharvest> or that you could mix water with flour and then put it on a stove to cook
[0:49:08] <+ThomasOfTroy> Hitman games?
[0:49:08] <+FennecZephyr> @PatStaresAt Does Skyrim count?
[0:49:08] <%Mr_Pylon> Forgotten City kind of fits too.
[0:49:09] <@QueequegTheater> Okay boomer
[0:49:11] <%hewlettfan96> Bioshock infinite is wank
[0:49:11] <%Baby_Hotpockets_> Baby_Hotpockets_ subscribed at Tier 1. They've subscribed for 23 months! Hey Pat! Recently got a fun job as a horticulturist, and got my own fur baby! Thanks for all the laughs! Hope you, Peach, and the pets are doing well!
[0:49:12] <+BettyMwwaahh> hmmm
[0:49:12] <@ssjklyco> So half life 2?
[0:49:12] <GamerWorlock> Do you know there's an esport farming simulator scene?
[0:49:13] <+FennecZephyr> Maybe 50%
[0:49:13] <%JoshManVGH> So Half Life immersive sim?
[0:49:17] <RAH001> yep
[0:49:19] <%MrMegaJackpots> arx fatalis count?
[0:49:21] <xeros720> i'm still surprised when you have the option of blowing doors off
[0:49:22] <+ThomasOfTroy> Does Hitman?
[0:49:27] <+Thyzoon> that dog is THIRSTY
[0:49:31] <%PocketBearIllustrator> we're back to the genre debate again, aren't we?
[0:49:32] <%RetroCop87> BOTW is an immersive Sim
[0:49:32] <valerios_> @MrMegaJackpots totally
[0:49:33] <tanarath> HL2
[0:49:33] <@ssjklyco> Gravity Gun
[0:49:33] <wolfen091> so tetris is an immersive sim
[0:49:34] <%Treasure_Vault> Bouncing the darts in Prey gives same brain chemicals as Half Life 2 crossbow bounces
[0:49:36] <@commanderclaw> Or solve the puzzle
[0:49:36] <$DocMadfox> Also stack boxes
[0:49:36] <+BettyMwwaahh> so an Immersive Sim is a game that allows you to pick items up?
[0:49:37] <ChaosedStar> seems sus
[0:49:37] <Dunmarkh> you can't pick up boxes in skyrim, doesn't count
[0:49:38] <%Ipsenscastle> @Baby_Hotpockets_ that sounds like a neat job!
[0:49:38] <Tisaric> yeah Half Life is too linear
[0:49:40] <+Deekman> Shenmue?
[0:49:41] <%crimsonharvest> skyrim? no way. skyrim has the same depth of options as fallout 4.
[0:49:42] <ShiningAxis> who doesn't love seesaw puzzles
[0:49:43] <%BinaryFireball> half life 2 was a garbage game despite the great engine
[0:49:43] <niffinbox> the old splinter cell games?
[0:49:45] <fluffy_sauce> How did Pat get a copy of Prey? I remember playing this game back on the Xbox360
[0:49:45] <Coystick> ALMOST, the Elder Scrolls games could be immersive sims if their props and elements had systemic properties, it's frustrating
[0:49:48] <+FennecZephyr> @RetroCop87 Unironically probably
[0:49:48] <%Treasure_Vault> But how to kill motherfuckers dead? So many options.
[0:49:49] <%RealThiele> CROWBAR THAT SHIT
[0:49:49] <RAH001> wait i can open this door and flush da toilet???!?!?
[0:49:51] <doctor_be> If it has an excess of optional vent paths, its an immersive sim
[0:49:51] <$ItsRatman> But how can i kill the water barrel see-saw puzzle?
[0:49:52] <%Dopamien> I miss half life story FeelsBadMan
[0:49:53] <tanarath> You can run sometimes
[0:49:56] <VirtuaRailith> finally, the gief
[0:49:57] <+GuilKato> Using LAMs in Deus Ex 1 to climb a bulkding since they stick to the wall and then are a surface so you can jump on them
[0:49:57] <%RetroCop87> he looks like his dad
[0:49:58] <JetpackMcQuack> RPG through this level
[0:50:00] <%ironohki> I am old man who played Ultima 6 and 7. Now I totally get this.
[0:50:01] <%JoshManVGH> Even gravity gun becomes "Kill those fuckers dead" though
[0:50:06] <Chronomancer_Supreme> What a big boi!
[0:50:07] <@QueequegTheater> LOVE HIM
[0:50:07] <susukouhai> aww fatboi
[0:50:08] <DSD24> @fluffy_sauce This is Prey 2017 not the one with Tommy
[0:50:12] <%kingmemelord97> its the boy
[0:50:13] <stantheman_97> fallout?
[0:50:14] <rambling_madman> if you can drink the toilet water it's an immersive sim
[0:50:14] <ChaosedStar> Vampire masquerade? @PatStaresAt
[0:50:14] <%GalacticaPhanto> @fluffy_sauce not the same game. reboot sort of?
[0:50:15] <+redthebaron> what a good baby
[0:50:18] <Profmcstevie> The most immersive sim part of Skyrim is buckets on NPCs heads blocking their eyesight for stealing
[0:50:23] <@QueequegTheater> He is not fat >:(
[0:50:23] <%solracc25> Does Saboteur count as a sim?

[0:50:46] <+Freakin_Wolfy> Can you do that with YOUR skin????
[0:50:46] <+ThomasOfTroy> Okay, so the hitman games would count based on the "many solutions" criterion then?
[0:50:46] <Coystick> He loves grab

[0:51:02] <%RealThiele> jiggle those rolls
[0:51:03] <%Mr_Pylon> To be a modern immersive sim you need at least two of the following problem solvers: Weapon, Stealth, Traversal, Powers, and to pick up useless items
[0:51:04] <PanicSwytch> LUL LUL
[0:51:04] <+ThomasOfTroy> He rolls for days

[0:53:00] <DSD24> Wait are you talking the post ending bit?
[0:53:05] <@GeneralSCPatton> Did you use necromancy to turn dead people into more Neuromods?
[0:53:07] <xeros720> can't even remember what you're talking about
[0:53:07] <BinaryBetrayer> Like every Shock game it has a disappointing ending
[0:53:08] <%cobalt_phoenix_> wait the robot part?
[0:53:08] <ChaosedStar> is it indigenous in theme?
[0:53:09] <%hewlettfan96> System shock 2 is very average

[0:53:15] <+wmeldrum> in this works, things either shit or fuck
[0:53:17] <@QueequegTheater> What exactly defines something as an immersive sim
[0:53:17] <$ItsRatman> The shotgun in prey feels nice and meaty and thats all i care about
[0:53:19] <+wmeldrum> world*
[0:53:19] <%ironohki> I walk away for one second and Pat's talking about what shits.
[0:53:20] <+Deekman> That’s the - part of the A-
[0:53:20] <DSD24> OH YEAH
[0:53:22] <deathwatch308> I hated it on launch, went back last month and loved it
[0:53:23] <DSD24> That part
[0:53:25] <%blankwaffle> I randomly picked it up on psnow and couldn't put it down. I will say it's kinda hard on the hardest difficulty.
[0:53:25] <SaltyAzteca> OH YEAAAA
[0:53:27] <Tisaric> yeah that's really fucking annoying
[0:53:31] <DSD24> The Military Operators
[0:53:31] <rambling_madman> shotgun best gun
[0:53:32] <%cobalt_phoenix_> ohhh
[0:53:33] <%hewlettfan96> It sucks shit through a straw
[0:53:35] <%MidnightBurst12> yeah that wasn't great
[0:53:37] <zhenthrim213> sounds awful
[0:53:41] <Tisaric> it's not a great late game switch up
[0:53:42] <JetpackMcQuack> "finish up motherfucker"
[0:53:42] <xeros720> oh, i treated that like an escape sequence
[0:53:44] <%JoshManVGH> I need to break my Dishonored bias. I keep trying to push through Prey, and all I can think is how much happier I would be with a teleport option.
[0:53:48] <ChaosedStar> i muted him chat tell me when its safe to come back
[0:53:50] <%fearlesscoward9> Wait isn't taht only if you get a lot of mods?
[0:53:51] <AthenaAegis> So basically, the same mistake System Shock 2 made
[0:53:51] <Djinnazz> oh those things, They weren't that bad.
[0:53:52] <%cobalt_phoenix_> i don't really remember it being that bad
[0:53:55] <Tisaric> yeah I think I just fucking booked it
[0:54:00] <SaltyAzteca> I just gunned it
[0:54:03] <+gheremy84> Yeah that's  when I went from fighting to just running through
[0:54:08] <%cobalt_phoenix_> just zap em and gun em
[0:54:15] <%MrMegaJackpots> true
[0:54:15] <+gksnipa> i just had shit tons of shotgun ammo
[0:54:17] <rambling_madman> they arent
[0:54:18] <blackened61986> I played through Prey on the hardest difficulty and didn't find the ending too bad but I was pretty beast by that point.
[0:54:18] <doctor_be> combat in that game is kind of bad to be honest
[0:54:20] <SaltyAzteca> Most enemies are not fun to fight
[0:54:23] <%Rancaliber_> @chaosedstar He's done.
[0:54:24] <doctor_be> its a GREAT stealth game
[0:54:37] <Djinnazz> I loved the mind control phantoms. so fucked up and weaird.
[0:54:39] <%ironohki> There isn't a wrong weapon in Souls if it works for you.
[0:54:44] <deathwatch308> All the combat drones were awful
[0:54:45] <ChaosedStar> @Rancaliber_ thanks dood
[0:54:47] <%Treasure_Vault> There's a weird problem with combat and first person rpgs. Compare Prey and Outer Worlds.

[1:02:32] <%Ches_Neckbeard> Pat gout is a chronic illness. Are you afraid of space?

[1:08:03] <%GalacticaPhanto> I've never seen anything about Prey so I'm excited to see what this looks like
[1:08:09] <%KeiganOfAstora> @SaltyAzteca Sick!!!
[1:08:09] <%deathwatch308> procedurally generated if i remember
[1:08:10] <+rafaelba93> this game's mechanics worked so well as a roguelike
[1:08:11] <DSD24> This is super good
[1:08:13] <%KeiganOfAstora> Why didn't you stream you playing Prey?
[1:08:14] <%Sotetsu> Prey fmgGOOD
[1:08:16] <+BettyMwwaahh> its interesting that so many people are recommending this. ive only heard bad things of it
[1:08:19] <Tisaric> it's essentially it's own game honestly
[1:08:22] <%deviljhojho_> i aint complaining
[1:08:23] <%Ravioli_Ronin> Oh wow
[1:08:23] <%cooldude69xx> @KeiganOfAstora Does Mick ever stop winning?
[1:08:26] <%bassoontyphoon> @patstaresat for whatever reason the twitch link on the subreddit is saying you’re streaming mass effect btw
[1:08:26] <+HolePunchLeaf> Deathloop 0.5
[1:08:27] <%KeiganOfAstora> Interesting
[1:08:27] <Tisaric> you literally boot a different exe
[1:08:38] <+Undenizen> aww yeah just in time :D
[1:08:38] <%KeiganOfAstora> @cooldude69xx When he loses his job at Id, he stops winning :(
[1:08:42] <%deviljhojho_> so where are we crashing the moon
[1:08:53] <a_c_chirns> @BettyMwwaahh it's great and always has been; the OLD game also called prey was apparently bad though
[1:08:53] <%KeiganOfAstora> Rogue Like or Rogue Lite?
[1:08:54] <%Dakuu75> he was thinking about talking with his hands, now his hands are going nuts
[1:09:03] <%deviljhojho_> Rogue life
[1:09:04] <Tisaric> rogue lite
[1:09:04] <%Broand> Did you give this game a go beforehand?
[1:09:14] <%Treasure_Vault> @KeiganOfAstora Lites, 100%. I love unlocking shit.
[1:09:22] <+HolePunchLeaf> @a_c_chirns the old prey game was critically acclaimed but sold poorly
[1:09:24] <%KeiganOfAstora> Werd
[1:09:28] <%KeiganOfAstora> Wah. Wah.
[1:09:28] <+BettyMwwaahh> @BettyMwwaahh i specifically meant Moon Crash

[1:10:08] <%deviljhojho_> its an final fantasy like with wolfenstein elements and hades like aspects to its design
[1:10:09] <%Treasure_Vault> After watching his Resident Evil video, I binged Noah Cadwell-Gervais vids, including the one with both Preys. Pretty enlightening.
[1:10:15] <CoffeeShopA> Will this have spoilers to the base game?
[1:10:16] <%deathwatch308> gloo gun was such an amazing idea that immediately was turned into a semen joke
[1:10:20] <a_c_chirns> @HolePunchLeaf weird; I've only ever heard it was seriously flawed
[1:10:21] <ChaosedStar> wait Prey is a space game? I thought it was like nature n native themed
[1:10:32] <ChaosedStar> have i been bamboozled
[1:10:38] <Dova573> Man fuck this contract bullshit
[1:10:40] <%aWanderingKaivo> yes
[1:10:47] <%deviljhojho_> those were the first two games!

[1:10:53] <%shry7> you'll be with your family soon :)
[1:10:54] <+Undenizen> @ChaosedStar are you thinking of horizon zero dawn?
[1:10:54] <@QueequegTheater> *Evolve
[1:10:55] <+BettyMwwaahh> @ChaosedStar idk what the fuck you were looking at lmao
[1:10:57] <%deviljhojho_> with the rare native main character
[1:11:02] <+HolePunchLeaf> @ChaosedStar that was the old Prey, but that was bait the the old prey becomes a space game after the first level
[1:11:07] <%Ravioli_Ronin> Can’t wait for space indentured servitude to be real dnmSadge
[1:11:10] <%MrMegaJackpots> moon's haunted
[1:11:10] <%GalacticaPhanto> @chaosedstar that's the old game. this is kind of a reboot?

[1:11:34] <%VictorVonLouche> Duke Nuken Forever is an immersive sim omg
[1:11:34] <%deathwatch308> its not a reboot the only thing it shares is a name
[1:11:34] <+Undenizen> I have not seen Prey.
[1:11:35] <%aWanderingKaivo> and toilets you can flush
[1:11:35] <ChaosedStar> ooooh okay
[1:11:37] <PlaidisTheNewPlaid> I'm so immersed right now guys
[1:11:41] <+wolf34736> can you take a shit though?
[1:11:41] <KaiserMario> Do immersive sims also not have reflections?
[1:11:41] <+TallPixels> hey alright
[1:11:42] <%KeiganOfAstora> If it was just a random sink asset it wouldn't be simulating it properly
[1:11:42] <%ApollosAnimation> to much immersion
[1:11:43] <%deathwatch308> the old one was so good though

[1:12:16] <Gelphaze> Can't wait to have my coffee!
[1:12:17] <+HolePunchLeaf> @HolePunchLeaf civvie11 has a good video on it if you're interested, people wanted a sequel but there was never any real hope of it getting one, especially bc of the upper management back then

[1:12:53] <%Daxalog> @PatStaresAt The "robot part" in later Prey was one of the better momments for my character build since I went full hacker/engineer (no combat skills) so my ammo and health were usually low.  I was able to hack the bots and get lots of free strong robots to fight 4 me
[1:13:00] <%Daxalog> oh woops
[1:13:07] <+thelonechris> Prey 2006 had some good biotech guns

[1:13:24] <%aWanderingKaivo> does Prey 2017 actually have any connection to old Prey besides the name? I know nothing about the old games.
[1:13:24] <%Ravioli_Ronin> THAT’S A FUCKIN GOBLIN

[1:13:36] <%KeiganOfAstora> Dead Space girl
[1:13:39] <$ItsRatman> SHOTGUN
[1:13:45] <Tisaric> I really like that this DLC lets you experiment with some of the other paths you could've taken in the base game
[1:13:48] <%cade_calrayn> That’s a goblin
[1:13:51] <@QueequegTheater> The Lost
[1:13:54] <Mattais88> LAPPY
[1:13:56] <ChaosedStar> he looks like he could use some sleep n some selfcare
[1:13:56] <%KeiganOfAstora> Vidya Vaati?
[1:13:58] <niffinbox> please pick the janitor and clean up the space goo
[1:13:59] <%Monkeyweed21> MINDJACK
[1:14:02] <@GeneralSCPatton> Good luck playing as dead weight
[1:14:04] <+HolePunchLeaf> Janitor = Deprived class OMEGALUL
[1:14:06] <%KeiganOfAstora> DEPRAVED
[1:14:07] <+rasend0ri> Cousin she is the cousin
[1:14:07] <+Undenizen> Janitor is legitimately the coolest character.
[1:14:09] <@QueequegTheater> That is literally just Gordon Freeman lady
[1:14:14] <sun312772> Butholes time
[1:14:14] <DSD24> Claire is a nice name
[1:14:14] <%KeiganOfAstora> @HolePunchLeaf Totally LUL
[1:14:15] <%VictorVonLouche> Wow she'll be a pain to play
[1:14:17] <%Treasure_Vault> Riley Yu is a cousin?
[1:14:18] <SaltyAzteca> The strongest profession in the world. Da Janitor
[1:14:20] <ChaosedStar> Claire best girl
[1:14:20] <+ThomasOfTroy> Isn't Vijay Bhytia a character in Mass Effect 1?
[1:14:20] <%KeiganOfAstora> Totally just Depraved from Dark Souls

[1:14:44] <%aWanderingKaivo> this guy looks like he is not OK
[1:14:53] <%LeRouch_the_Rebel> Volunteer should be in quotes tbh
[1:15:02] <%WhereIsWill> ive actually never seen anything about prey so this is cool
[1:15:06] <SaltyAzteca> Oh man its weird to be back in Prey
[1:15:11] <KaiserMario> Andrius looks like a Nosferatu or somethn like that
[1:15:14] <+Undenizen> In a scifi game, being a janitor is not only the most hilarious, it also means people would ignore you in 90% of scenarios
[1:15:15] <SmigGames> can you play with bug eyes on this one too?
[1:15:18] <+ThomasOfTroy> VolunTOLD more like it
[1:15:41] <ChaosedStar> Prey im assuming is one of thse games that get thrown on steam sales a lot so better to just wait for those?
[1:15:47] <%Ipsenscastle> why does everyone always refer to the DS class as 'depraved' when it's clearly 'deprived'?
[1:15:47] <kazadaz> Oh I forgot this mode replayed all the tutorials, so annoying
[1:16:01] <Coystick> Wait a minute, that box...
[1:16:04] <@QueequegTheater> @PatStaresAt Mention that the Deluxe Edition is $12 USD on PSN right now

[1:17:03] <@QueequegTheater> Eat the wrench
[1:17:22] <%deathwatch308> The broken leg trauma almost made me vomit just from the sound. Like using a chicken as a hackey sack
[1:17:24] <+Undenizen> is there an advantage to having your wrench be a pretzel?
[1:17:27] <niffinbox> eat the moon its good cheese
[1:17:28] <@QueequegTheater> Wait, so "immersive sim" is just Bioshock-like?

[1:17:48] <%Bluwizard21> reminds me of borderlands
[1:17:51] <DSD24> Since it was the first one
[1:17:51] <%xcompleasedad> Man, wait until you get the GOOD unlocks on this. Better than base game shit
[1:17:51] <Tisaric> immersive sim is more "Deus Ex/System Shock Like" but yeah
[1:17:53] <%BinaryFireball> is this the e3 level?
[1:17:54] <@QueequegTheater> I don't know what that is
[1:17:57] <%BinaryFireball> it iiiisss
[1:17:59] <cs0402196> nice to look at what on breach could potentially destroy.
[1:17:59] <+wmeldrum> @queequegtheater moreso systemshock, but yes

[1:19:33] <Dunmarkh> splorch
[1:19:45] <+rafaelba93> mimic is the best enemy in the game i think
[1:19:51] <Fancypants25> @PatStaresAt Can you move the camera please? We can't see your character's health because of MASSIVE muscular body.
[1:19:59] <%Broand> So that stops typhon from passing through
[1:20:03] <+wmeldrum> so you're telling me prop hunt/tf2 is an immersive sim? :Y
[1:20:05] <%xcompleasedad> @PatStaresAt If you have too many spells, it will detect the magic and repell you
[1:20:09] <%Dakuu75> I wouldn't mind if the next Bio shock was in space

[1:23:43] <%DrTomT18> Are you only going to stream this once?
[1:23:46] <%blankwaffle> without spoilers did you like the ending?
[1:23:55] <kazadaz> Interesting technique

[1:24:10] <DSD24> and the music stingers for it
[1:24:11] <Tisaric> god I love the shotgun model in this game
[1:24:11] <%Broand> Durability
[1:24:14] <artificiallynatural> hey look! tools!
[1:24:17] <kazadaz> Weapons degrade (very slowly)
[1:24:18] <+rafaelba93> new ,echanics
[1:24:24] <DSD24> You can put all this stuff in the main game
[1:24:26] <%Daxalog> THIS has DURABILITY AND TRAUMAS
[1:24:28] <+Mr_Killed_Instantly> When did you last play Space Station Silacone Valley on the N64?
[1:24:31] <IvanMistwalker> crazy talk
[1:24:32] <Djinnazz> ask an d thall shalt receive
[1:24:32] <%deathwatch308> durability is a bitch but I love the tension that comes from it from time to time
[1:24:33] <%xcompleasedad> You have NO IDEA how different this game type is. YET.
[1:24:34] <kazadaz> There are also enemies who do big damage to your weapons
[1:24:35] <Tisaric> yeah they added all that with the mooncrash dlc that option wasn't in base game
[1:24:36] <%Cerabret100> Did it? i don't remember that being a thing but i haven't played since release
[1:24:36] <cs0402196> does it fall apart?
[1:24:38] <DSD24> Trauma's are brutal
[1:24:45] <Khester824> Turn off enemy health bar for big immersion
[1:24:47] <%aWanderingKaivo> I dig the ammo display on that
[1:24:54] <Kalakukkoo> you can get kill those little poppers by throwing random props at them
[1:24:55] <@QueequegTheater> Is that a Mossberg 590
[1:24:57] <@QueequegTheater> Nice
[1:24:58] <kazadaz> U gotta go up into the security tower
[1:25:01] <SaltyAzteca> Youre not lost, youre exploring
[1:25:06] <Tisaric> on release they didn't have the traumas/durability options but when the DLC came out they made them optional for the base game
[1:25:16] <%VictorVonLouche> Or live
[1:25:20] <+Mr_Killed_Instantly> WHO DOESN'T
[1:25:23] <%aWanderingKaivo> why would you want to?
[1:25:26] <xeros720> speaking of, that's one alive guy
[1:25:26] <kazadaz> Hey Pat, how long did you spend trying to get into that locked closet with the bodies in it
[1:25:32] <+rafaelba93> every body has a name right?
[1:25:45] <Dame_90> And they could be fucking Phantoms LUL
[1:25:46] <%VictorVonLouche> Playable characters?
[1:25:46] <%gustavozxd> I love that everyone that works on this space station is named and has a body somewhere
[1:25:46] <Djinnazz> yup
[1:25:49] <%bassoontyphoon> Like maybe unlock a new character????
[1:25:58] <+rasend0ri> The little balls react to any and all MOVEMENTS. So grab a chair or box, toss it at them and watch them self destruct
[1:26:34] <%VictorVonLouche> oo so if you damage the zone it carries through?
[1:26:37] <kazadaz> So the Crater is the hub you're in; there are also the 3 themed areas
[1:26:39] <%Cerabret100> I feel like all those are going to change as time goes on
[1:26:41] <Djinnazz> welp...
[1:26:43] <SaltyAzteca> ah
[1:26:46] <Gelphaze> GREAT!
[1:26:46] <Tisaric> you thought LUL

[1:32:14] <notsoy> you really stab yourself in the eye with that shit, ew

[1:32:36] <nipplestheenchilada96> the other one is you
[1:32:39] <ExpressNode> So is this DLC just another part of the game or a continuation?
[1:32:44] <kazadaz> Gotta shoot the console
[1:32:53] <kazadaz> WAITY I WAS WRONG
[1:32:55] <Djinnazz> neat.
[1:33:08] <%s_xylocalsingles> @ExpressNode its its own thing different location different people
[1:33:09] <DSD24> @ExpressNode New part of the game completely separate
[1:33:11] <Slimshazbot> @ExpressNode A separate run-based mode
[1:33:16] <Tisaric> @ExpressNode it's own story that has connections but is  completely seperate
[1:33:25] <SaltyAzteca> BLAT
[1:33:26] <ShinBojangles> @kazadaz I didn't know you could shoot the ring wither LUL
[1:33:34] <%s_xylocalsingles> the four of us said the same thing with different words.
[1:33:38] <%solracc25> metroid doors

[1:34:03] <$DocMadfox> The Paranoia sets in
[1:34:10] <Latija> does removing the o2 kill the ayliens?
[1:34:21] <Calamity2007> So if you die at any point in this DLC do you have to do it all over?

[1:35:12] <%deathwatch308> @shurtal I've got Jim Beam that count?
[1:35:12] <$DocMadfox> @Djinnazz Pretty sure that was the Tentacle Nest
[1:35:16] <Tisaric> @Calamity2007 there's progression outside the runs but you do need to win 5 runs b2b with each character

[1:35:34] <ShinBojangles> Exactly how I thought that would go LUL
[1:35:34] <@QueequegTheater> Reminder that this game is currently $12
[1:35:35] <Gelphaze> Food!
[1:35:36] <%bassoontyphoon> F
[1:35:36] <+PenmanLupine> did you ?
[1:35:37] <Dova573> could have killed it
[1:35:39] <%DrTomT18> you didn't even try and fight em!
[1:35:39] <extradopeness> i forgot how stressful these enemy encounters were
[1:35:40] <kazadaz> You had the psi blast too though
[1:35:40] <+Rofiarf> could you stun it?
[1:35:42] <+Kaiserzelcor> Haven't heard that death sound in awhile
[1:35:44] <Djinnazz> escape pods had a barrier up, lol.
[1:35:45] <%Dakuu75> ♪♪ but, in the end it didn't even matter~ ♪♪
[1:35:48] <Dova573> You did 75 dmg
[1:36:01] <Calamity2007> @Tisaric Okay I guess let me ask this if you fail with any of the characters do you have to do the whole set again or can you continue from your current character
[1:36:01] <danraven> damn now I want to replay both prey and mooncrash
[1:36:05] <Tisaric> basically each run is play through with each character you have unlocked
[1:36:06] <%Broand> That's right this is a roguelite!
[1:36:14] <%TheWinged7> 4k simPoints
[1:36:18] <+AmuserName> Sim Points? More like Simp Oints. Kappa
[1:36:28] <%DrTomT18> what can you do with Simpoints?
[1:36:29] <%Dakuu75> "Simp Points"
[1:36:33] <Calamity2007> Man Sims 5 seems crazy
[1:36:33] <%bassoontyphoon> Pat don’t forget to use the security station to find people of interest
[1:36:37] <%rumtumtugnutz> Boy, Meth Pat is a looker
[1:36:44] <extradopeness> la pistola
[1:36:45] <@GeneralSCPatton> I believe you can also just buy more Neuromods
[1:36:47] <Tisaric> @Calamity2007 if you die with one character you can continue with the others you have unlocked but won't be able to get a true win
[1:36:53] <%deathwatch308> @rumtumtugnutz JESUS
[1:37:00] <%dakotachipmath> What happened to "mass effect on wendsday"? :(
[1:37:01] <SaltyAzteca> GLOO Cannon can be used for a lot of things, its very versatile
[1:37:02] <%VictorVonLouche> Gloo's crazy useful for traversal tbh
[1:37:07] <ChungusQuest> gun it up baybee
[1:37:08] <%ComfortableStranger> who doesn't love covering things in their white goo?
[1:37:10] <+ThomasOfTroy> I really like how the gloo gun let you sequence break in the base game
[1:37:18] <%TIME_PUNCHER> I'll sim your lation
[1:37:20] <SaltyAzteca> @dakotachipmath This is mass effect Kappa
[1:37:23] <Calamity2007> @Tisaric Is the ending to the DLC different depending on if you get a true win or not?
[1:37:27] <TotallyNotPolo> You preppin for Deathloop, pat?
[1:37:28] <Djinnazz> Stair case in a can.
[1:37:34] <kazadaz> No gloo bullets though
[1:37:39] <nipplestheenchilada96> that flashlight is a perfect rectangle
[1:37:41] <+rasend0ri> Gloo gun has more utility lol
[1:37:45] <DSD24> I hear mimic noises
[1:37:50] <%deathwatch308> randomized equipment too?
[1:37:56] <%VictorVonLouche> Least those thermal mimics are gonna get blown away at a safe distance lol
[1:38:00] <%TIME_PUNCHER> when does Pat unlock the door with a NERF gun
[1:38:03] <kazadaz> i LOVE the rectangular flashlight
[1:38:13] <Tisaric> @Calamity2007 iirc you don't get an ending until you get all 5 out in one run
[1:38:20] <+BigCoffee> are mimics the only enemy?
[1:38:23] <%drabberfaun535> This was back when bethesda was letting devs do what they want and it wasn't working out for them
[1:38:28] <Djinnazz> problem solved
[1:38:38] <+fetrigon> GUN
[1:38:39] <Link232> Hey this time you don't have three greater Mimics up your ass at the start
[1:38:40] <+rbakervv> @BigCoffee oh my no, jus the most common
[1:39:00] <Calamity2007> @Tisaric If Pat is planning on getting that than goodluck to him. Imagine if he dies at the last character. Then again this seems to be most difficult early on
[1:39:32] <kazadaz> Just FYI, the mimic portal ending hasn't been unlocked yet.  You should try to get more characters or just escape any way you can.
[1:39:37] <Latija> eat it
[1:39:37] <%deathwatch308> trauma kit
[1:39:39] <+Undenizen> wow those textures look... greaaat...
[1:39:39] <%xcompleasedad> No, it's NOT
[1:39:42] <DSD24> That helps with Burns actually
[1:39:42] <%Broand> Don't forget to check bodies too
[1:39:47] <Tisaric> @Calamity2007 yeah they let you build up a ton of power over the runs, it's like Hades where it's kind of inevitable you'll win if you put the time in
[1:39:48] <@GeneralSCPatton> I thought skin grafts were for treating burns
[1:39:52] <ShinBojangles> wrong LUL
[1:39:53] <%xcompleasedad> You are gunna need burn shit VERY soon.
[1:40:03] <DSD24> Burn Trauma is real rough
[1:40:06] <+fetrigon> crazy talk
[1:40:08] <%deathwatch308> reading is difficult apparently
[1:40:13] <Calamity2007> @Tisaric Yeah there are macro upgrades it seems which is good.
[1:40:25] <%drabberfaun535> I gotta say I love mooncrash. I wish arkane made more of this instead of dishonored 2
[1:40:28] <voodoolawyer> are mimics what pat's mind goblins are irl
[1:40:38] <+fetrigon> it's fine
[1:40:39] <voodoolawyer> "why are you smacking coffee cups" "you gotta"
[1:40:46] <+Undenizen> is there anything that stops you from attacking literally everything?
[1:40:50] <kazadaz> Yeah same
[1:41:02] <%AFellowDegen> @Undenizen time
[1:41:04] <%Dakuu75> that perspective seems off
[1:41:09] <Latija> you have long arms
[1:41:09] <%Treasure_Vault> First person melee distance judging is never great
[1:41:11] <@OfficioPrefectusCorgi> Yea
[1:41:12] <%twistedj3ster> yeah, it felt off
[1:41:13] <$DocMadfox> Agreed
[1:41:16] <%deathwatch308> conical hitbox
[1:41:17] <+fetrigon> yeah depth perception shit
[1:41:17] <Dunmarkh> yeah that animation sucks
[1:41:25] <+Undenizen> that's the power of pretzel wrench
[1:41:26] <%dawarw0lf> It’s the fov right?
[1:41:32] <Coystick> The pipe in OG System Shock has the range of a shotgun it's jank
[1:41:40] <%AFellowDegen> dead body right there
[1:41:41] <voodoolawyer> KIM JUNG UN?
[1:41:44] <RealPT1> some times fov will make the feel worse or better
[1:41:47] <nipplestheenchilada96> you missed a corpse
[1:41:57] <%moonmintparadise> you missed some to your left
[1:42:04] <extradopeness> @deathwatch308 more like "comical"
[1:42:05] <%AFellowDegen> fair
[1:42:09] <RyuuAoi> Damn it! Did I miss a lot!?
[1:42:15] <%deathwatch308> JUMP
[1:42:15] <$ItsRatman> A nice QoL would be your reticle changes color if you can hit it or not
[1:42:18] <dukenux> waow this game is like a Bioshock in space
[1:42:20] <%dawarw0lf> The reason I can go back and play Fallout 4 and Skyrim on Xbox is because I can mod in better fov
[1:42:22] <dukenux> Kappa
[1:42:25] <kazadaz> It's semi-random.  Like you'll learn all the potential neuromod spawn points pretty quick.
[1:42:27] <SaltyAzteca> EZIO THAT PHANTOM
[1:42:27] <Tisaric> @drabberfaun535 it seems like deathloop is going to take a lot of ideas from this
[1:42:34] <%arkv01> is this dlc a teaser for the matrix 4 🤔
[1:42:34] <SaltyAzteca> YEYEYEYYE
[1:42:44] <%kingmemelord97> owww my eyes
[1:42:44] <%TheWinged7> spends hundreds of points on silenced pistol, doesnt use it
[1:42:44] <ChungusQuest> How in the hell does Death From Above do LESS damage??
[1:42:45] <%MooseIsGoose> assassin creed style
[1:42:47] <extradopeness> @dukenux almost jad me bro
[1:42:57] <extradopeness> had*
[1:42:58] <$ItsRatman> GEE I WONDER
[1:43:00] <%Ipsenscastle> LUL
[1:43:05] <%dawarw0lf> I tired playing dishonored and it was rough! I was having fun just doing lethal but rush view man
[1:43:06] <Tisaric> I love the dumb ragdoll mimics LUL
[1:43:12] <%drabberfaun535> @Tisaric Yeah but the theme and style will be different. I like this.
[1:43:12] <SaltyAzteca> He was late BibleThump
[1:43:16] <%Ipsenscastle> you saw it with your special eyes
[1:43:20] <RyuuAoi> That was tough
[1:43:27] <%Daxalog> Just throw a thing
[1:43:31] <%xcompleasedad> Yes?
[1:43:45] <%Teintstein> hi :)
[1:43:45] <%lloyddboy> Hello
[1:43:46] <dukenux> i just rewatched the "Toys in the Attic" ep of CB, and now im in a mood for some space horror
[1:43:47] <kazadaz> Remember you've got the kinetic blast power
[1:43:49] <dukenux> nice timing
[1:43:50] <Latija> don't they just give you armor?
[1:43:52] <%bassoontyphoon> They repair your suit
[1:43:54] <Link232> God I always love those microthrusters for the Operators
[1:44:01] <Tisaric> @Tisaric ah ok yeah I totally agree, I love this setting and hope they find a way to come back to it after
[1:44:13] <+Undenizen> I can't believe they remastered Gmod Prop Hunt.
[1:44:17] <extradopeness> if you see a stranger follow him
[1:44:29] <+rasend0ri> It only repairs your suit
[1:44:31] <dukenux> lesson 3
[1:44:44] <+vaderxyz1970> Yeah foam darts
[1:44:49] <SaltyAzteca> Ahh the dart gun, what a good gun <3
[1:44:50] <%dawarw0lf> Man I hope deathloop has a fov slider for console as I can’t anymore if it doesn’t. I even tried going back to Prey and couldn’t.
[1:44:54] <Tisaric> YEAH
[1:44:56] <kazadaz> And that's beyond the blockage
[1:44:57] <%Broand> Those rooms change
[1:45:02] <%drabberfaun535> Deathloop looks like its got a good idea and bad directing and execution.
[1:45:03] <Dame_90> YEP
[1:45:08] <+rasend0ri> Cyistoids can be trivialized by just throwing something at them
[1:45:08] <RyuuAoi> Is this space Skyrim?
[1:45:09] <%xcompleasedad> The room types change
[1:45:21] <IvanMistwalker> ROOM CHANGE
[1:45:22] <Tisaric> shit changes each run it's pretty crazy
[1:45:26] <%Monkeyweed21> its the type of supplies changes
[1:45:26] <Latija> turn into a cup and roll through the gap
[1:45:27] <@QueequegTheater> Budget cuts, man Kappa
[1:45:33] <%xcompleasedad> @RyuuAoi VERY modded Space Skyrim, sure.
[1:45:44] <KosOrSomeSayKosm_> but you are of value Pat
[1:45:52] <kazadaz> So in later runs they start fucking with the power; this is where you go to fix it
[1:46:01] <dukenux> WELCOME
[1:46:04] <%TheWinged7> welcome to the circus of vaallujeee
[1:46:04] <%Dakuu75> SAME XD
[1:46:09] <DSD24> Welcome to the Circus of Value!
[1:46:09] <dukenux> to the CIRCUS OF VALUEEES
[1:46:12] <DSD24> HAHAHAHAHA
[1:46:17] <Dova573> same
[1:46:19] <%deathwatch308> COME BACK WHEN YOU GET SOME MONEY BUDDY
[1:46:27] <DSD24> Tell your friends about the Circus of Value!
[1:46:27] <Dova573> I head that clown everytime
[1:46:28] <%dawarw0lf> I forget the name but actual space Skyrim I’m actually excited about it because Todd seems to really care about it too.
[1:46:31] <SaltyAzteca> No one remembers the Ammo Bandit BibleThump
[1:46:31] <Dame_90> Bioshock flashbacks NotLikeThis
[1:46:32] <%Dakuu75> "Come back when you got some money, buddy~!"
[1:46:32] <Dova573> hear
[1:46:36] <nipplestheenchilada96> that clowns laugh gave me conniptions
[1:46:45] <kazadaz> "One"
[1:46:50] <%deathwatch308> Ammo bandito?
[1:46:50] <DSD24> @dawarw0lf Was it Starbound or Starfield?
[1:46:58] <+vaderxyz1970> The recycler is the best part of Prey 2017
[1:47:00] <dukenux> Starfield
[1:47:06] <dukenux> Starbound is already a game
[1:47:12] <%drabberfaun535> I like the not so obvious vertical design in these levels
[1:47:12] <DSD24> The Power to the People upgrade stations were cool too
[1:47:17] <dukenux> or a game studio
[1:47:21] <dukenux> one of two
[1:47:21] <DSD24> @dukenux Thanks for the correction
[1:47:29] <%soulphantom44> soulphantom44 subscribed at Tier 1. They've subscribed for 9 months! finally made my sub baby
[1:47:31] <%Treasure_Vault> So is there a mod suite that turns Prey into a 10./10?
[1:47:36] <@QueequegTheater> Reminder that Bioshock 2 was better than 1
[1:47:39] <RyuuAoi> Fuck those things. Creep bullshit
[1:47:54] <dukenux> @QueequegTheater Correct opinion
[1:47:55] <DSD24> Drill Dash is the sickest shit in Bioshock 2
[1:47:56] <%deathwatch308> @QueequegTheater yes and no imo
[1:47:58] <kazadaz> Liza does!
[1:48:06] <%Treasure_Vault> And that the one Bioshock 2 dlc was better than any other bioshock anything
[1:48:20] <%Treasure_Vault> Minerva's den?
[1:48:21] <DSD24> @Treasure_Vault Minerva's Den
[1:48:22] <Dova573> Psi blast was my best friend in this
[1:48:26] <SaltyAzteca> Tecnho something
[1:48:29] <+polothegreatest> bio2 gave us big sister
[1:48:29] <Dame_90> Regenerate yo self
[1:48:29] <%Broand> I took zero typhon abilties on my first run
[1:48:31] <%dawarw0lf> @dsd24 It was Starfield that was it. I know concerns people have with it but it seems to be a genuine attempt at a game. After the cynsism weighed me down during outer worlds I’m excited for a “clean” approach if that makes since.
[1:48:34] <%deathwatch308> anyone else actually enjoy the multiplayer in 2?
[1:48:38] <dukenux> Bioshock 2 is like: Imagine actually having fun PLAYING Bioshock
[1:48:39] <kazadaz> CHECK THAT FLOOR HOLE
[1:48:40] <Escherite> I love this game's soundtrack
[1:48:44] <%Treasure_Vault> Big sisters are dumb tho
[1:48:47] <+AWanderingKenku> Give yourself a Pat on the back
[1:48:49] <Tisaric> the multiplayer in 2 was fun for what it was
[1:48:57] <DSD24> @deathwatch308 I did until people only rolled with the broken loadouts
[1:48:57] <%deathwatch308> floorgina
[1:49:00] <Tisaric> it didn't have much longevity but I had some fun times with it
[1:49:01] <Dunmarkh> how immersive
[1:49:09] <berserkexponent> is this a standalone part? or dlc? Should i go watch his playthrough first?
[1:49:09] <%Treasure_Vault> this feels just as good as wall ham
[1:49:15] <LorcaNomad> God I forgot how much I fucking love the technology aesthetic in this game
[1:49:18] <%deathwatch308> @DSD24 fair enough, crossbow or the elephant gun
[1:49:24] <%deviljhojho_> lov me some neuromods
[1:49:31] <%Puhff> the Flussy
[1:49:34] <SaltyAzteca> Dont underestimate the silenced pistol in fights. It can do lost of damage
[1:49:35] <dukenux> yea the art direction is pretty clean
[1:49:35] <+Pars_Librum> @berserkexponent Mooncrash is standalone

[1:52:11] <DSD24> @Gelphaze "Found you"
[1:52:19] <%Treasure_Vault> What's a better name than immersive sim?
[1:52:23] <dukenux> looks 2001
[1:52:27] <%trackles_64> Beat the game
[1:52:29] <+rasend0ri> It powers up stations of the map that might be out of power
[1:52:31] <%bassoontyphoon> psaCrazyhead psaCrazyhand
[1:52:32] <%Treasure_Vault> WAIT
[1:52:36] <SaltyAzteca> HE DID IT
[1:52:36] <DSD24> @Treasure_Vault First Person Explorers

[1:52:37] <%Daxalog> Best girl unlocked
[1:52:39] <%deathwatch308> immersim?
[1:52:39] <%xcompleasedad> YES. You REALLY do need to close them. I have lost runs for not.
[1:52:40] <ShinBojangles> Stream over :)
[1:52:41] <+Undenizen> you won!
[1:52:42] <%drabberfaun535> Now things get interesting
[1:52:42] <Latija> ez
[1:52:46] <digaogrunge> WHY NO EXPLORE
[1:52:47] <%Treasure_Vault> Can you toss all your shit on the ground before you leave?
[1:52:48] <%UvBenServed> psaDab
[1:52:48] <dukenux> Clap
[1:52:48] <KaiserMario> FIRST TRY
[1:53:05] <+ThomasOfTroy> Pat, did you see the escape pod ending in the base game?
[1:53:07] <%kingmemelord97> !iuptime
[1:53:08] <Tisaric> is the final one
[1:53:09] <DSD24> I see Texas from here
[1:53:11] <Tisaric> and yeah
[1:53:17] <%sjay662> BIG ZAPPS
[1:53:22] <%Treasure_Vault> Can you drop items?
[1:53:24] <Tisaric> the final character is the absolute hardest to get through
[1:53:24] <%xcompleasedad> Actual Zapping
[1:53:24] <%cobalt_phoenix_> oh wow
[1:53:25] <%kingmemelord97> !uptime
[1:53:25] <+AmuserName> ZZZZZZZZAPPP
[1:53:25] <@Moobot> @kingmemelord97 I've been playing this game for how long? Oh only 1h 53m.
[1:53:26] <+Rofiarf> Couldn't you drop everthing on the floor?
[1:53:27] <%VictorVonLouche> Cant you just drop it all beforehand?
[1:53:27] <%Broand> yeah you can just put it in a box before you leave
[1:53:28] <SaltyAzteca> Oh that aint the only difficulty, heh
[1:53:28] <DSD24> That's why you gotta plan ahead
[1:53:28] <Gelphaze> AHHHHH!
[1:53:31] <%trackles_64> Goblin habits lol
[1:53:33] <Tisaric> you get a mule to share items
[1:53:35] <kazadaz> You can dump it all in a box or a body before you leave if you like
[1:53:37] <%Monkeyweed21> ZAAPPPP
[1:53:37] <$lotharrio> So do not scrape. Neat.
[1:53:37] <DSD24> Yeah you can drop stuff
[1:53:38] <KaiserMario> @PatStaresAt Can't you drop the stuff for the next guy?
[1:53:42] <%xcompleasedad> @Treasure_Vault Last I remember? No.
[1:53:44] <ShinBojangles> shoulda dropped it
[1:53:48] <%kingmemelord97> you did it
[1:53:54] <%TIME_PUNCHER> took all that ammo you saved
[1:54:00] <%Broand> PLOT
[1:54:02] <LorcaNomad> does that mean throwing all your stuff on the ground before beating the run gives your next character a lifeline @PatStaresAt ?
[1:54:08] <Dame_90> Then they're fucked LUL
[1:54:10] <%Garthunox> cant you drop everything before getting in it?
[1:54:20] <Tisaric> you'll have to go pick up anything you drop but yeah you can
[1:54:23] <+ryukosbuns> @PatStaresAt  FF14 been great so far lvl50 BLM!
[1:54:32] <+GuilKato> imagine what would happen if Pat went to pee again - he'd come back too soooooooo many sim points
[1:54:40] <%Treasure_Vault> Brain topography scans, however? Huge damage.
[1:54:43] <+FattimusSlime> What is this, Road 96 in space?  Where’s the serial killer and punk rock girl?
[1:54:44] <%xcompleasedad> That vault is so fucking funny with hindsight.
[1:54:52] <Dunmarkh> @LorcaNomad that character still has to basically beat the run
[1:54:57] <%Lizard0TM> Pat refusing to acknowledge that he could drop things for the next run?
[1:55:07] <Visorak6> Watch it fuck your sound settings LUL
[1:55:08] <%kingmemelord97> wait so theres a chance of brain damage form thes sims ?!
[1:55:09] <SaltyAzteca> Its just like real life Kappa
[1:55:09] <kazadaz> "We've made the game harder, please acknowledge"
[1:55:11] <Latija> not immersive, didn't hang at 99%
[1:55:18] <%Treasure_Vault> The fun of being right.
[1:55:20] <+Rofiarf> I agree with pat actually
[1:55:25] <DSD24> Suffer like G did
[1:55:26] <BigFingerRo> ya gotta work for your meal}
[1:55:27] <akitanito> future pat will later blame past pat for that
[1:55:27] <%Broand> oh you will
[1:55:27] <%deviljhojho_> to live is to struggle
[1:55:29] <+ThomasOfTroy> Not doing it is /me non-optimal
[1:55:34] <%bassoontyphoon> Pats right
[1:55:37] <%Piemono> Also shit gets worse on the base
[1:55:39] <Tisaric> corruption is a bitch
[1:55:43] <DSD24> Aww yeah its Joan
[1:55:50] <+HolePunchLeaf> people already complaining about non optimal play sigh
[1:55:50] <%xcompleasedad> @PatStaresAt You can STORE items. Do NOT drop them.
[1:55:58] <kazadaz> Joan is the only character who can repair broken stuff
[1:56:04] <+ThomasOfTroy> God, this lady looks so tired of all this shit, I love it
[1:56:12] <dukenux> Engineer Gaming
[1:56:29] <%Treasure_Vault> There feels like a really cool co-op game in here.
[1:56:35] <DSD24> That's the kicker is that since Joan can fix shit you made need her for other objectives
[1:56:37] <Tisaric> the bounties are really fun
[1:56:46] <dukenux> The face of someone who just wants to leave the Moon
[1:56:52] <Tisaric> and yeah stuff is super cheap which really helps you speed up the start
[1:56:55] <dukenux> (btw MOON is a good movie)
[1:56:56] <+ThomasOfTroy> Bad ending points for using healing iteams
[1:56:57] <%Daxalog> @PatStaresAt Make sure to look at the turrets you make. She names em like in Catacomb Kids.
[1:57:11] <kazadaz> The Moon Is Harshing My Buzz
[1:57:13] <TioXyco> you can't hange bodies, so no can leave the moon]
[1:57:21] <%drabberfaun535> This moon is haunted and I would like to leave.
[1:57:21] <%DeadRuins> moons haunted
[1:57:44] <DSD24> Moon's actually haunted this time
[1:57:57] <%xcompleasedad> Turret is AWESOME
[1:57:58] <Tisaric> moon's corrupted
[1:58:01] <SaltyAzteca> Summon Turret is so fun
[1:58:04] <Saltmeisterr> SUMMON TURREY
[1:58:07] <%cobalt_phoenix_> WHAT
[1:58:07] <Tisaric> turret is best boi
[1:58:09] <%4DLuvOfLuthy> Oooo nice
[1:58:11] <nuane> building a sentry
[1:58:12] <%Daxalog> They always have unique names
[1:58:12] <kazadaz> Summon turret costs 0 PSI
[1:58:14] <%drabberfaun535> All the turrets are named after birds
[1:58:15] <$lotharrio> Turret friend is great!
[1:58:19] <%bassoontyphoon> Joan is waifu
[1:58:25] <%MidnightBurst12> oh damn

[1:58:30] <%Broand> Good luck finding a way off!
[1:58:32] <Tisaric> yeah everything you do is saved in the simulation
[1:58:33] <%xcompleasedad> Actual Zapping PogChamp
[1:58:42] <Dova573> You dont have to carry it
[1:58:45] <+garagon31> @Link232 They use aimbot
[1:58:48] <%bassoontyphoon> ZAPPING SYSTEM
[1:58:54] <akitanito> true, this is the real zapping system
[1:58:55] <Tisaric> yeah actually zapping LUL
[1:58:58] <%VictorVonLouche> corpse of enemies still there
[1:59:00] <DSD24> Yes
[1:59:01] <Visorak6> Its going up
[1:59:01] <%Lizard0TM> can you unsummon turret?
[1:59:03] <%Treasure_Vault> Don't dawdle
[1:59:05] <%xcompleasedad> Yes
[1:59:06] <%cobalt_phoenix_> ohhhhhhh

[1:59:38] <+ThomasOfTroy> Ye, right pat is better than left pat
[1:59:39] <%Monkeyweed21> its not as brutal as Risk of Rain
[1:59:41] <%bassoontyphoon> it’s risk of rain with a zapping system
[1:59:46] <ChungusQuest> so we get to fight giant space jellyfish? I guess we kinda are already

[2:06:31] <%twistedj3ster> yeah, I wish there was more media that used it
[2:06:35] <Escherite> If I had the money I would so commission a model of the TranStar station
[2:06:37] <+critikal_bit> Arkane has some pretty great art designers
[2:06:39] <cs0402196> very purdy, even if it freaks me out about it getting broken.

[2:08:21] <Tisaric> yeah they really put in a lot of work to make it a bit different than the base game
[2:08:21] <Kain5707> they put a lot of work into mooncrash
[2:08:24] <notsoy> OOHHH BANANA
[2:08:24] <%kingmemelord97> yeah its on gamepass just checked
[2:08:28] <BinaryBetrayer> That lunar crater was a completely new environment area too.
[2:08:30] <Dame_90> But a proper sequel would also be on Earth
[2:08:32] <+TheBitingIrish> They NERFED the crossbow?

[2:09:53] <SaltyAzteca> Oh yeaaaah I forgot that you need the mod to fly it
[2:09:56] <Tisaric> It's wild that Mick Gordon did this game's OST as well
[2:10:01] <+vaultzombie> Like his BIG PENIS

By the way, if y'all are still struggling with the name, think Megidolaon but with maids. Remembered Paige was still struggling with it recentlyish
[2:10:51] <nuane> she's fine! (dead)
[2:10:52] <%Broand> You can try the tram system
[2:10:54] <Tisaric> yeah it's crazy how Mick had Doom 2016 followed by this game
[2:10:56] <Saltmeisterr> @OneThousandTomatoes sol nerfs?
[2:10:57] <kazadaz> (You should go to the tram station)
[2:11:11] <OneThousandTomatoes> Haven't looked yet
[2:11:12] <%deathwatch308> bandage?
[2:11:16] <Tisaric> like completely different soundtrack styles but both are so perfect for the game

[2:11:58] <+TheBitingIrish> Bitterns are silly
[2:12:05] <SaltyAzteca> Its in the items box
[2:12:11] <%Daxalog> Booming bitterns. Bitterns are Britain's loudest bird. They went extinct in the 1870s
[2:12:15] <Visorak6> Its an item
[2:12:15] <%bassoontyphoon> ITEMS
[2:12:17] <SaltyAzteca> Your items I mean
[2:12:34] <BinaryBetrayer> What does Corruption do?
[2:12:49] <%deathwatch308> YEET
[2:13:01] <SaltyAzteca> :(
[2:13:06] <%drabberfaun535> fix the door behind you
[2:13:11] <+Pars_Librum> You can repair that door now
[2:13:14] <+rbakervv> @BinaryBetrayer raise the diffulculty
[2:13:17] <%trackles_64> this mode sohuld of been its own game
[2:13:19] <%xcompleasedad> @BinaryBetrayer It's a timer for the WHOLE run. All of the characters.
[2:13:20] <kazadaz> Angela's signal is currently on the tram station
[2:13:31] <%Broand> There's an alternate exit here
[2:13:42] <%Treasure_Vault> Are any of those fans  secret crawl vents?
[2:13:42] <%MrMegaJackpots> the tram
[2:14:00] <Kain5707> o
[2:14:06] <%Broand> That's a useful one
[2:14:13] <+rasend0ri> Hold on
[2:14:17] <+rasend0ri> Don’t
[2:14:23] <%Treasure_Vault> yay
[2:14:26] <%trackles_64> Officer PAt
[2:14:29] <+rasend0ri> You will need those mods later
[2:14:55] <%RealThiele> buy your fellow slave some liquid pain management slave
[2:15:01] <%deathwatch308> get im
[2:15:08] <SaltyAzteca> The fuckin chord twangs Kreygasm
[2:15:23] <kazadaz> CHECK THOSE CORNERS MARINE
[2:15:31] <Dragovus> @patstaresat there was something under the desk in the recycler room
[2:15:31] <+rafaelba93> you should
[2:15:40] <%xcompleasedad> Don't worry. It's only a real concern for when you need to do all five.
[2:15:46] <Zhylaw> eat it
[2:15:48] <%Bluwizard21> So when's Scorn coming out?
[2:15:49] <ToneBacas> i don't remember that thing
[2:15:50] <kazadaz> (Seriously, I think Vijay's body is in this room)
[2:15:56] <%kingmemelord97> eat it
[2:15:56] <%deathwatch308> @PatStaresAt its a timer when it fills all the way you get removed from the level
[2:16:06] <softbirby> I like this game but I kinda hate how its completely unrelated to the other prey game.
[2:16:15] <BinaryBetrayer> Wouldn't it be funny if the first tram to arrive is a Mimic?
[2:16:17] <ToneBacas> oh yeah this is mooncrash. i definitely would not remember any of this then
[2:16:17] <%Order_of_Mystery> wait, I wonder if Corruption has something to do with how the security sees you? I know in the main game if you get too Typhon'd up, turrets will see you as an alien and shoot at you
[2:16:20] <cs0402196> Wave 1
[2:16:27] <TioXyco> @softbirby Mooncrash? well... it kinda relates
[2:16:32] <%Broand> Vijays body is in the labs version of this room
[2:16:33] <%bassoontyphoon> Yup
[2:16:44] <kazadaz> Never mind - he's in one of the other tram stations
[2:16:57] <+rasend0ri> Those are SUPER affective against the Moon Shark. You can even kill it in one!!!!!
[2:17:11] <%Broand> I hope that wasn't backseat pilotty :V
[2:17:36] <wolfen091> refreshments pat
[2:17:43] <softbirby> @TioXyco Nah, I mean the 2006 Prey from Human Head.
[2:17:55] <%Broand> Oh isn't he? I coulda sworn
[2:17:56] <TioXyco> @softbirby Oh. I see
[2:17:59] <MyNameIsRasus> yo i could go for some refreshments
[2:18:02] <%deathwatch308> VENT! embrace your inner rat
[2:18:03] <%bassoontyphoon> Man I adore how this DLC gives you a chance to play different archetypes (magic, engineer, soldier, scientist, and average joe) with each of the different unlockable characters
[2:18:04] <softbirby> It was a really cool set up and idea and its a shame Prey 2 fell through.
[2:18:06] <+ThomasOfTroy> Might be in the service hatch back there
[2:18:35] <kazadaz> In ten hours you will be sprinting through these levels
[2:19:07] <Visorak6> you needed to recycle a science one
[2:19:10] <SaltyAzteca> Pistol is just an uzi
[2:19:10] <akitanito> it's doing good work
[2:19:10] <Kain5707> yea the pistol is great
[2:19:13] <KosOrSomeSayKosm_> great balls, Pat
[2:19:22] <%PhysicsLB> but are you jarl ballin?

[2:19:47] <masterfire23> nah he tweakin
[2:19:51] <%drabberfaun535> botia's body is placed randomly in the map. use a security station to track his body

[2:20:14] <Saltmeisterr> FAR SLASH NERF
[2:20:16] <BinaryBetrayer> I'd be running in constant panic with that corruption countdown going.

[2:21:10] <kazadaz> sall good
[2:21:18] <+ThomasOfTroy> But fair
[2:21:23] <%deathwatch308> 1 bit of hurry and you miss so much
[2:21:30] <+rasend0ri> Pat senpai noticed me
[2:21:32] <%bassoontyphoon> Keep playing at this pace I’m enjoying
[2:21:40] <kazadaz> Hey what was your fave area in the base game?
[2:21:53] <%deathwatch308> recycler charge?
[2:21:56] <MyNameIsRasus> i like the robot voice that says "no typhon detected"
[2:21:57] <i_chevalier> why does this feel like surge?
[2:21:59] <%Monkeyweed21> the challenge
[2:22:01] <SaltyAzteca> Cuz there's a lot more at stake, and no saves
[2:22:14] <kazadaz> They're securiity operators, they're made for fighting
[2:22:14] <SaltyAzteca> OH ITS THE LASER OPERATORS
[2:22:15] <+rafaelba93> it makes you use all the mechanics and be inventive
[2:22:22] <%deathwatch308> this is my BOOMSTICK
[2:22:27] <Kalakukkoo> remember to use your turret ability. it's free
[2:22:30] <akitanito> bonk
[2:22:40] <BinaryBetrayer> Free turret estate
[2:22:42] <%deathwatch308> SHOP SMART, shop S Mart
[2:23:00] <MyNameIsRasus> this is prey 1 tho
[2:23:04] <Kain5707> prey 1? you mean OG prey?
[2:23:11] <%xcompleasedad> Make them neuromods!
[2:23:11] <kazadaz> In the base game, you learn the map super well, but you only go most places twice.  Mooncrash lets you benefit from the knowledge more
[2:23:50] <%deathwatch308> repair the door?
[2:23:50] <+rafaelba93> this kinda went to deathloop? the repeating and the time
[2:23:53] <nipplestheenchilada96> and i'm assuming the corruption carries over between the characters?
[2:23:57] <akitanito> don't crazy talk yourself
[2:24:00] <+rasend0ri> Now get to the ship!!!!!
[2:24:00] <sweatch0> dont lick the goop
[2:24:04] <kazadaz> Vijay
[2:24:04] <+ThomasOfTroy> I feel like I went to most places WAY more than just twice
[2:24:09] <MyNameIsRasus> steve jobs
[2:24:10] <i_chevalier> plus it more likely for you to find something you miss the second time playing
[2:24:16] <SaltyAzteca> Dont forget the overconfidence is a slow an insidious killer
[2:24:32] <chrishansen69_> discovering the meaning of life is a true joy
[2:24:37] <%LeRouch_the_Rebel> It's probably Indian then
[2:24:39] <%deathwatch308> What other game had Vjay in it? i feel like far cry but not sure...
[2:24:43] <%Garthunox> vijay

[2:25:28] <SaltyAzteca> All enemies respawn STRONGER
[2:25:32] <nipplestheenchilada96> oh so its like am ACTUAL time limit
[2:25:33] <%drabberfaun535> The danger of corruption is overhyped imo

[2:38:12] <%Daxalog> Kasma is just bonus points
[2:38:12] <%Broand> ngl I think this run is gonna be more of an info gathering session than a successful escape
[2:38:20] <sweatch0> gloo gun parkour!
[2:38:26] <+ThomasOfTroy> @drabberfaun535 I see what you did there KappHD
[2:38:39] <+ThomasOfTroy> KappaHD

[2:45:28] <%Treuan> three*
[2:45:31] <chrishansen69_> Lets lose.."pat at his best effort.. untill next time!
[2:45:34] <PlaidisTheNewPlaid> Learning is for nerds!
[2:45:36] <%LeRouch_the_Rebel> LUL Pat spitting facts
[2:45:36] <ArchHippy> Quitter.
[2:45:40] <%drabberfaun535> So i guess there was a wrench in your plan?
[2:45:41] <IvanMistwalker> You family
[2:45:44] <%DrTomT18> at least you keep your powers
[2:45:44] <+reknownblackcat> I played Prey but I do not recognize this. was this DLC?
[2:45:50] <%AzureGale> Time 2 just pee
[2:45:59] <%AzureGale> @reknownblackcat Yes
[2:46:04] <%DrTomT18> @reknownblackcat DLC/Stand alone
[2:46:17] <%blankwaffle> I wish the psnow version had the dlc
[2:46:20] <kazadaz> So I asked that Q about Deathloop back at the start of the stream, but twitch took a shit and i didn't hear the answer, what did pat say?
[2:46:22] <SaltyAzteca> Did Pat lose the run?
[2:46:25] <digimonda> its not stand alone, you need the base game to play it
[2:46:25] <ExpressNode> Just started the Arise demo on my Series X and that game plays pretty good
[2:46:34] <Kain5707> he sure did
[2:46:54] <SkinnyRite> Uh, is it just me, or is that bass... a little fucky?
[2:47:10] <chrishansen69_> PlaidisTheNewPlaid, nerds are peeing too.. pats could be learning
[2:47:26] <Yakobro> @SkinnyRite change quality and back, it's twitch changing the playback speed to catch up
[2:47:26] <Kain5707> fart bass
[2:47:59] <%YakumoYomi> @ExpressNode Seems like it runs well on PS5 and Series S/X, but relatively poorly on PS4 and XB1
[2:48:02] <SkinnyRite> @Yakobro Oh my God thank you so much, I was so scared for a minute there
[2:48:55] <IvanMistwalker> the Child
[2:48:56] <sweatch0> the burgers
[2:49:03] <ExpressNode> @YakumoYomi Oh I didn't know that.  I set it to priortize graphics and it stays at 60fps I believe.  Sucks they didn't optimize it well for previous gen
[2:49:15] <IvanMistwalker> Burger Child cares nothing but sustenance
[2:49:33] <tlflordhand> lmao
[2:49:35] <Kain5707> mind goblins
[2:49:37] <%twistedj3ster> sorry to hear that Pat, didn't realize
[2:49:42] <akitanito> antimindgoblin game
[2:49:49] <tlflordhand> not even to corruption 3 yet and he already stressed
[2:49:55] <%Bluwizard21> @PatStaresAt It is super interesting for a roguelike that you can actually just have no wait to fight anymore and have to accept death
[2:50:02] <kazadaz> It can be worthwhile to do some runs where you just explore and harvest resources, you'll lose but get a lot of points
[2:50:04] <sweatch0> get wrench in case
[2:50:07] <chrishansen69_> Kain5707, you gotta be more poetic, Im singling you out!
[2:50:15] <@GeneralSCPatton> If you decide not to finish, look up the ending.
[2:50:25] <%DrTomT18> pistol, ammo.
[2:50:57] <chrishansen69_> GeneralSCPatton, your side ran and forgot to record. I read it from the other side
[2:51:19] <kazadaz> There's beaucoup food in the Crew Quarters btw
[2:51:51] <Kain5707> @chrishansen69_ what?
[2:52:36] <chrishansen69_> Im in line for the alcoholic stamps, Ignore my message. Still great name!
[2:52:38] <%Broand> it's green!
[2:52:41] <%AzureGale> Oh no, a hentai nest
[2:52:42] <tlflordhand> wrong, you can evade side to side in the base game too
[2:52:48] <Kalakukkoo> security dude has the artax propulsion system
[2:53:02] <tlflordhand> those nest are cancer
[2:53:04] <%Broand> The nests fuckin blow
[2:53:09] <ExpressNode> Tentacles for days
[2:53:27] <ShinBojangles> Just shoot them from a distance Jebaited
[2:53:28] <%AzureGale> Good thing none of the characters are students, huh
[2:53:41] <kazadaz> Moon shark is not random; he's always there in a new run
[2:53:58] <chrishansen69_> tentacles will carry a  flag shittely
[2:54:44] <tlflordhand> this game is fresh and full drip in comparison to every other game Arkane studios did
[2:54:49] <ShinBojangles> I remember getting absolutely ruined by monsters using the elevators when I'm not looking
[2:54:53] <ArchHippy> The jetpack has a new ability here. Double tap jump while holding a direction in the air.
[2:54:58] <%twistedj3ster> I wish Cosmodread had a mimic. VR would be crazy
[2:55:12] <%drabberfaun535> Check above the store!
[2:55:30] <kazadaz> That's a plot thing, you can't use them normally
[2:55:44] <kazadaz> (the kill towers i mean)
[2:55:59] <%Broand> oh I missed this entirely
[2:56:17] <Kain5707> complete global saturation
[2:56:18] <tlflordhand> too bad the typhon hunter 4 v 1 pvp version of prey sucked ass
[2:56:27] <@Ranryu692> Ranryu692 subscribed at Tier 1. They've subscribed for 39 months! I was in Madrid airport earlier today on my way home from visiting family and the weather was really shitty. It turns out the rain in Spain *does* fall mainly on the planes
[2:56:27] <%Broand> Might be escape pods
[2:56:35] <%drabberfaun535> I was hoping there would be a cool blueprint up here
[2:56:41] <+dreadsnappi> this game sucks you even eat it
[2:56:43] <chrishansen69_> Albert should be mourned
[2:56:49] <%Broand> Sometimes there is a cool blueprint

[2:58:12] <akitanito> KILL IT
[2:58:15] <%Shubreaker> kill
[2:58:16] <SaltyAzteca> Lure it away?
[2:58:16] <Kalakukkoo> moon shark is typhon
[2:58:18] <kazadaz> Don't touch the ground
[2:58:22] <%Broand> Distract it with a typhon lure thrown away from it?
[2:58:22] <%AzureGale> Roll over. Try not to cry. Cry a lot.
[2:58:23] <akitanito> or disruptor I think
[2:58:23] <BasicOutRage> kill the shark
[2:58:24] <%drabberfaun535> dont touch the sand and the shark cant see you

[3:00:02] <%AzureGale> Such is the nature of rogue lites
[3:00:07] <ArchHippy> Seriously though. Double tapping jump in the air is a game changer.
