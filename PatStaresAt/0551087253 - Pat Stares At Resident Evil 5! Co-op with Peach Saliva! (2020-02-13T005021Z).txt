[0:01:07] <%SoFarFetched> only throw
[0:01:09] <shandytowne> Yeah boiiiiii
[0:01:23] <%goatbait> is this part 2?

[0:01:29] <draugrix> DONT LET PAIGE GET THE LANDMINES
[0:01:29] <reonome> dammit still watching woolie
[0:01:30] <%DerKupo> sup chat c:
[0:01:33] <%StaceMcGate> Woolie's KOTOR 2 stream is awesome. Little V is the best cohost
[0:01:53] <Pwgregory> It’s happening. Soon.
[0:02:09] <%goatbait> I'm guessing I missed part 1 is Paige playing too?
[0:02:24] <%ha2ken> She should be still
[0:02:25] <CanadianAnimatorGuy> Yeah
[0:02:26] <%ElenaManetta> wee-woo-wee-woo it's the eyeball mobile
[0:02:26] <draugrix> @stacemcgate I'm gonna watch the vods later
[0:02:33] <%Sphincter_Spelunker> Paige is playing and did very well
[0:02:34] <%SirGO0SE> left tiddy right tiddy
[0:02:38] <%chill_o_wisp> lmao I LITERALLY just finished watching last night's stream on VOD
[0:02:38] <shandytowne> They did so well in part 1
[0:02:45] <%StaceMcGate> Reminder, Paige had died 0 times. All deaths been on Pat
[0:02:48] <%tizz86> tizz86 gifted a Tier 1 sub to draugrix! They have given 166 Gift Subs in the channel! 
[0:02:49] <%tizz86> tizz86's Gift shared rewards to 5 others in Chat! 
[0:02:53] <shandytowne> Exactly as much bickering as you’d expect but WAY more progress as well
[0:02:55] <%SoFarFetched> Well she technically died once because Pat missed the truck LUL
[0:02:55] <%ha2ken> Woolie's on that KOTOR2 but I like this tiddy more so...
[0:02:58] <%rytyoung> alright so how bad did they fuck up last night? I had to bail before they could clear the village
[0:03:05] <+Bigwillie773> Bigwillie773 subscribed with Twitch Prime. 
[0:03:17] <%SoFarFetched> They cleared just fine.
[0:03:25] <%SoFarFetched> Everything's been pretty good actually.
[0:03:31] <Pwgregory> They didn’t fuck up. Peaches was great.
[0:03:32] <foulfoamz> it went a lot better than expected
[0:03:36] <Zaphire_Saucypants> ayooooo
[0:03:36] <%tigerspath> hi chat! hope everybody's had a great day.
[0:03:37] <%kingmorsluciscaelum> psaFist
[0:03:38] <%SoFarFetched> Pat even admitted that this run is better than both RE runs he did with Matt and Fuggins.
[0:03:42] <%trekkie11041> paige despite some bumbling did pretty ok
[0:03:43] <tigerfang86> heyo
[0:03:52] <42nfl19> They they make it past the truck scene? what about the motorcycle scene?
[0:03:53] <Zaphire_Saucypants> I am ready fo mo PnP.
[0:03:54] <%rytyoung> I'm glad, co-op split screen is tough
[0:03:55] <tigerfang86> yeah paige is powerful
[0:04:02] <shandytowne> Paige still has not even CLOSE to internalized the quick turn though
[0:04:07] <%SoFarFetched> @42nfl19 They stopped after Bat Centipeded Boss.
[0:04:07] <%demegodz> paige too powerful
[0:04:09] <+aversal_ammar> Paige somehow better than Matt at RE5
[0:04:13] <%Sir_stride> psaDab
[0:04:27] <%ha2ken> Will Paige do a successful quick turn during combat today? Stay tuned...
[0:04:28] <%StaceMcGate> To be fair, Pat isn't hogging all the weapons this time. Teamwork makes the dreamwork
[0:04:33] <%honeyman18> psa1guy_HF why make this I ask myself
[0:04:40] <%ElenaManetta> psa1guy psa1guy psa1guy psa1guy psa1guy psa1guy
[0:04:44] <%ElenaManetta> why is the 1 man so funny
[0:04:49] <Pwgregory> Pat died like twice and Paige beat the boss...
[0:04:52] <fruit_pie_the_magician> Paige was doing only slightly less well than Pat and Pat has played every mainline RE like 4 times at least
[0:04:54] <%ElenaManetta> sipsipBaby sipsipBaby sipsipBaby
[0:04:54] <tigerfang86> one guy is eternally funny
[0:04:55] <%SoFarFetched> Also I think Matt wasn't really into playing RE5 at the time.
[0:05:03] <tigerfang86> because the one guy isn't you, but hes being made fun of
[0:05:09] <%ElenaManetta> psaSleep psaSleep
[0:05:17] <%StaceMcGate> Last night One guy was right tho
[0:05:20] <%ha2ken> psa1guy is going to strike again. He's a Jimmy.
[0:05:25] <%foreverN2dust> psa1guy_TK
[0:05:25] <%SuperFineButtHairs> Oh boy
[0:05:28] <+aversal_ammar> Man if Paige carries Pat again today, we’ll have to rename the stream to PaigeStaresAt
[0:05:30] <42nfl19> oh snap, so I missed the truck and motorcylcle QTEs? @SoFarFetched
[0:05:31] <heartlesshealer> LuvPeekR
[0:05:35] <tigerfang86> I don't trust psa1guy to keep being right
[0:05:41] <%patriotrenegade> Oh I can’t wait for this section
[0:05:44] <Zaphire_Saucypants> @42nfl19 ye
[0:05:49] <heartlesshealer> You missed huge truck failure
[0:05:55] <shandytowne> Paige only needs a couple things. 1) quick turn. 2) burst-firing the MP5, not holding it down.
[0:05:55] <42nfl19> who failed it?
[0:05:57] <heartlesshealer> Pat
[0:06:01] <42nfl19> PAT?
[0:06:05] <%SoFarFetched> @42nfl19 Yeah Pat fucked up the truck the first time cause he was like "I GOT IT" and missed it completely. Paige didn't shoot at all cause she was like "YOU SAID YOU GOT IT SO I DIDN"T SHOOT"
[0:06:07] <%rytyoung> see I knew I wasn't smooth sailing
[0:06:07] <%patriotrenegade> Choked.
[0:06:08] <%ha2ken> Check their twitters
[0:06:11] <Zaphire_Saucypants> If anything I think only Pat has died so far
[0:06:14] <heartlesshealer> "I got this" *chokes*
[0:06:15] <%rytyoung> it*
[0:06:17] <Zaphire_Saucypants> twice? I wanna say.
[0:06:19] <%Sausious> of the like 4 deaths yesterday 3 were pat
[0:06:19] <%honeyman18> This should be amazing tonight
[0:06:22] <%SoFarFetched> Pat's died 3 times about.
[0:06:29] <oniwahoo> PatChokesAt
[0:06:32] <%happyface699> Woop

[0:06:37] <heartlesshealer> Paige has done really well, actually
[0:06:40] <%Dementedpenguin> Can't wait to see Paige carry Pat all the way to the ending.
[0:06:40] <%happyface699> VoteYea VoteYea VoteYea VoteYea VoteYea
[0:06:40] <42nfl19> did anyone die at the motorcycle QTEs?
[0:06:40] <%OwlLightningMage> Paige actually did super good
[0:06:41] <Zaphire_Saucypants> ye
[0:06:43] <+Kegeto> how much i missed?
[0:06:44] <%SoFarFetched> Paige died once because Pat killed her with the truck.
[0:06:48] <%Nny7229> If I send a sub anniversary message now will Pat see it?
[0:06:51] <%SoFarFetched> @42nfl19 no they passed that just fine.
[0:06:52] <%OwlLightningMage> Paige defeated the sundowning
[0:06:53] <%Dementedpenguin> *but seriously, Paige did good yesterday
[0:06:55] <42nfl19> booo
[0:06:56] <+CelticFrost70> brownSPOOKY brownSPOOKY brownSPOOKY brownRIP brownRIP brownRIP
[0:06:57] <shandytowne> They died once in village, once at the truck, and...? Where other death?
[0:06:57] <%StaceMcGate> @foreverN2dust psa1guy is universal, 1/2/3 is only for this channel
[0:07:03] <heartlesshealer> she even climbed a ladder to unknowing safety while Pat led enemies around all over at one part
[0:07:16] <%patriotrenegade> Don’t tell her I said this, but I’m super proud of Paige.
[0:07:19] <%SoFarFetched> @shandytowne think it was in the underground area or something where he also died at. I could be wrong.
[0:07:20] <%StaceMcGate> village, truck, and mountain
[0:07:22] <heartlesshealer> just before bug fight
[0:07:35] <Vohs_Bru> no rest for the wicked
[0:07:36] <%SoFarFetched> oh right it was a mountain LUL
[0:07:39] <shandytowne> Ohhhhhh yes right before the bug fight. Cause of splosions
[0:07:43] <Pwgregory> Just wanted to say I’m watching this from England and though I’m a relatively new fan I think you two are pretty awesome. And also you Pat! ;)
[0:07:46] <fruit_pie_the_magician> This is going to be one of those games Paige is inexplicably good at
[0:08:00] <heartlesshealer> Yeah, that time Paige got stunlocked and couldn't help Pat

[0:08:17] <%OwlLightningMage> Seeing new fans make me feel good
[0:08:18] <shandytowne> Pat was NOT being very charitable about her stunlock either

[0:40:37] <+megabman> Thanks for the LuvPeekR @sleepy_coffee
[0:40:39] <mannywatcha> E3 is fucking dead.
[0:40:40] <fairore> indeed
[0:40:41] <%spiritofmojave> E3 is going full influencer mode now
[0:40:41] <Hydrapissed> yahhh
[0:40:41] <derap41> E3 is so fucking trash
[0:40:42] <%majima666> e3 is a corporate circle jerk now
[0:40:42] <Pwgregory> Dolphins are notorious sea rapists.
[0:40:47] <%roundii> What about Peggle 2
[0:40:47] <peachy996> Konami E3 though
[0:40:47] <Dame_90> E3 without Sony = ASS
[0:40:47] <%rytyoung> I used to get excited for E3, now it's just a waste of time
[0:40:48] <graemecrackers1> Paige Big Mac or Double quarter pounder?
[0:40:49] <%rytisone> I started watching E3 since 2012 LUL
[0:40:51] <%OwlLightningMage> I love that everyone is abandoning E3
[0:40:51] <%majima666> mgs marathon when?
[0:40:54] <%drdemenz> @sirvante115 They use jellyfish for that and eat puffer fish to get high.
[0:40:56] <%RubberFistFight> @Pwgregory yeah they got them rape caves
[0:40:56] <peachy996> I'd have lived to go to that Konami event
[0:40:56] <%ElenaManetta> you caused this pat
[0:40:57] <%KeystoneA1> E3 is only good for Crowbcat videos
[0:40:57] <Ion_Laser> E3 is dangerously incompetent with people's data
[0:40:57] <Shonen_hero> PAX is okay I guess
[0:40:58] <%ElenaManetta> you did this to yourself
[0:41:00] <%worldbrand> I'd have gone to 2006 or 2005 or whatever one had that zelda shit
[0:41:01] <%ShichiNoBushi> Ask Woolie if you can borrow his time hole.
[0:41:01] <Psych_man13_13> would you want to have gone to the konami conference?
[0:41:02] <derap41> Dolphins face fuck fish
[0:41:03] <%Hilleltaco> And just like that, you've cancelled it out psaCrazyhead

[0:41:28] <%Th3SmartAlec> Judgment Cut Off PogChamp
[0:41:29] <sakeydo> Holy crap crazy talk activated. this years E3 will be killer! Lol
[0:41:30] <%cvp5127> 1 ep
[0:41:33] <%rumtumtugnutz> Episode 3 is the cutoff.
[0:41:35] <fairore> @stacemcgate oh boy
[0:41:35] <%blackbaron98> 3
[0:41:35] <+razielhex> a movie's length
[0:41:35] <%king_wragles> 3 is a good number
[0:41:36] <%warmnoid> "It gets good 300 chapters in bro"
[0:41:36] <%OwlLightningMage> 4
[0:41:37] <%ShichiNoBushi> 3 is usually the standard.
[0:41:38] <derap41> 3 unless a ton of people say it gets better
[0:41:42] <%Sphincter_Spelunker> 1 and half before I tune out
[0:41:42] <%spiritofmojave> 2 seasons it gets good! I promise
[0:41:43] <%unclekulikov> 3 eps, or a curated viewing list.
[0:41:44] <%TRILLTURBAN> What about Jojo?
[0:41:45] <%SirGO0SE> shows like TNG wouldn't be watched if that was the case
[0:41:46] <%theAncopro> but what aboutr hunterxhunter
[0:41:46] <SkyPirateArcane> The only show I say that for is JoJo.
[0:41:46] <%rumtumtugnutz> If its still trash, its not gonna get better
[0:41:47] <Pwgregory> And people think Orcas are cute...and kinda forget that they earned their nickname of Killer Whales!
[0:41:47] <Shonen_hero> what about TNG tho
[0:41:47] <%Sphincter_Spelunker> RWBY sucks
[0:41:49] <Kirijuo> HunterXHunter takes 30 before it takes off
[0:41:50] <%goatbait> I thought it was 4?
[0:41:50] <%king_wragles> Those people watch One Piece and should not be trusted
[0:41:51] <cherrycottontail> when people say that I start on season 2, fuck you
[0:41:51] <SirVante115> @drdemenz Wait, Whaat?! that's wild
[0:41:52] <fruit_pie_the_magician> HXH only REALLY gets good 30 episodes in
[0:41:52] <%Dementedpenguin> I always go " DansGame " when people say I have to watch 10 episodes before a show gets good
[0:41:52] <+CatastropheCorvid> BUT THE EXPANSE THO]
[0:41:53] <shinichizio> Just finish the tutorial, they said of FF13.
[0:41:53] <CookieCutter007> but it gets good 45 hours in
[0:41:54] <%RubberFistFight> @PatStaresAt you yourself have said basically that about TNG though dude, and it's valid.
[0:41:54] <%WheatlyXT> I agree
[0:41:55] <Fujiwara_92> 3~4
[0:41:56] <%Dragon_Batman> It depends on how many seasons, cuz Parks and Rec I here is like that
[0:41:56] <$lotharrio> 3 is the same ask as a movie. You can spare that for something new.
[0:41:56] <%Jack_of_No_Trades> The first several arcs of One Piece are a bit slow
[0:41:57] <terribleusername> TNG season 1 though
[0:41:58] <tealwolf26> It gets good halfway into Season 4 Kappa
[0:41:58] <+Shadicara> To not waste time 3 is the magic number
[0:41:59] <oniwahoo> I gave the walking dead two seasons and GoTs 4 seasons and never got into them
[0:42:00] <%ssjklyco> Parks and Rec is a good " Get through the first season"
[0:42:01] <%Nina96> @PatStaresAt what about jojo part 1?
[0:42:03] <%oddslogic> wasn't the first season of next generation pretty bad?
[0:42:04] <+razielhex> @SirGO0SE Start with the final episode of Season 1 and go from there.
[0:42:04] <Djinnazz> LIES
[0:42:04] <%Th3SmartAlec> @TRILLTURBAN With JoJo it's like 'skip to the next part and try again'
[0:42:04] <%blackbaron98> Bojack's first season wasn't good
[0:42:06] <%Breakfast_Megapowers> I say, first Arc unless it is above 15
[0:42:06] <derap41> Well yeah that's anime
[0:42:07] <%snow_bush> Korra is mediocre
[0:42:09] <%Quigsies> The manga is better paced
[0:42:09] <%spiritofmojave> TNG season 1 was ROUGH for me to get in on
[0:42:09] <CookieCutter007> LUL one filler
[0:42:09] <%worldbrand> here comes the rioting
[0:42:10] <%StaceMcGate> I was burnt out on One Piece by Skypeia
[0:42:10] <deity_majora> Don't watch one piece
[0:42:13] <%Deadpal> pat, star trek the next generation seasons 1 and 2
[0:42:14] <%majima666> after 51 episodes....yeah no shit lmao
[0:42:14] <mannywatcha> I really like one piece.
[0:42:16] <Nomad_Scholar> I stopped at the Skypia arc
[0:42:16] <+MassChaos23> ONE PIECE IS SO WORTH IT
[0:42:17] <%WheatlyXT> Parks and Rec you can just skip the first season tbh
[0:42:17] <%MelBrooksKA> But One Piece is always good
[0:42:18] <%onlypuppet> Who has the attention span for any of that
[0:42:18] <rafaelba93> tried filter removal for re5?
[0:42:19] <leargo> I give you 2 episodes
[0:42:19] <%marvel877> WAS IT THOUGH?
[0:42:19] <cureneckbeard> TNG doesn't get good until season 3
[0:42:20] <%BalloniWright> Korra is good :)
[0:42:22] <fruit_pie_the_magician> And Measure of a Man is season 2
[0:42:24] <%Sphincter_Spelunker> just read One Piece
[0:42:24] <Hydrapissed> one piece is EW
[0:42:25] <%marvel877> It kinda was, yeah.
[0:42:27] <tubit> I almost gave up on TNG
[0:42:29] <Pwgregory> TNG’a first season was shite.
[0:42:29] <%Rngiddion> the one piece anime aint worth it, just read the manga
[0:42:30] <+DinnerCalzone> I feel like a weirdo in thinking that the first season of TNG is alright
[0:42:33] <Pechugaman> Korra is shit
[0:42:34] <$lotharrio> Should have jumped in on episode 50 of One Piece... also you should read One Piece instead of watching it. Watching it will take 5-7 times longer.
[0:42:34] <tealwolf26> I like Korra, but maybe I am just a pleb.
[0:42:34] <Psych_man13_13> What about DS9?
[0:42:36] <+necrocannibal2> it needs a hook
[0:42:37] <%DracaenaLeaf> One Piece's anime isn't worth it, just th emnga and latest films
[0:42:37] <%majima666> @rafaelba93 they are on ps4
[0:42:38] <PrettyThickandStrongDyck> what's TNG?
[0:42:39] <Warbot40> One piece is good. The anime is so poorly paced.
[0:42:39] <%rumtumtugnutz> The first episode of TNG is like top 5
[0:42:41] <Cynical2DD> Watching one piece at all is insane
[0:42:43] <%RubberFistFight> Yeah alright PAt I'll give you that, Encounter at Farpoint is pretty awesome, if only for marina sirtis in that super short skirt Kappa
[0:42:44] <%SirGO0SE> @razielhex first ep is too important imo. even though its not great i still rewatch them lol
[0:42:45] <CanadianAnimatorGuy> So unlike Hero Academia where everyone sucks
[0:42:45] <%ElenaManetta> those were your first words
[0:42:46] <%windsoc> part 1 of jojo does the same thing. it starts strong, than slows down a bit. still incredible tho
[0:42:47] <%OwlLightningMage> One Piece is better to read and watch the parts you like the most
[0:42:48] <+wydamn> I quit One Piece at like #120 when I realized this was a show that was not intended to ever end, despite the main characters having a clear and singular goal.
[0:42:48] <%StaceMcGate> S1 OF TNG WAS BAD
[0:42:48] <Fujiwara_92> TNG doesn't get good... that's all, there's no episode cut point...
[0:42:50] <+Jontman42> It depends entirely on the particular show and how it interests you anyway so why even abide to a "rule"
[0:42:51] <%Grayhammatter> pat went in
[0:42:52] <%snow_bush> Doctor Who is over hyped and not even the good british humor.
[0:42:53] <etnoika> Honestly I think the way E3 has come undone has been the best case scenario. We're losing the actual convention and cringy live action shit but we still get game announcements through the individual streams.
[0:42:54] <ne0bunny> I'm reminded of people that say FF13 gets good after 30 hours.
[0:42:57] <%Ipsenscastle> There wasn't a hell of a lot else on tv at the time
[0:42:57] <%realm_forge> Pat did a haircut RETURN OF THE BEARDED EGG
[0:42:58] <%ssjklyco> Star Trek sucks
[0:43:00] <%ShichiNoBushi> "Robot" implies slave.
[0:43:00] <$lotharrio> Androids are robots.
[0:43:02] <%Th3SmartAlec> LUL

[0:43:09] <%worldbrand> planet paige
[0:43:11] <%Dementedpenguin> One Piece anime stopped being good a LONG time ago. The pacing is ATROCIOUS.
[0:43:11] <Kirijuo> Honestly just read one piece anyone wants to get into it, 900 episodes is too much
[0:43:12] <%axellogic> A Fabricated INDIVIDUAL
[0:43:13] <%onlypuppet> Just be a robot OWL2019snowball

[0:43:14] <Hydrapissed> SKa and reefer madness
[0:43:15] <%RubberFistFight> @snow_bush Dr Who has gone to shit recently, unfortunately. Classic Who was much more competent.
[0:43:15] <%ElenaManetta> there's no oxygen on planet paige
[0:43:16] <etnoika> Dr Who went to shit after Smith left.
[0:43:16] <%OwlLightningMage> Doctor Who is okay with spots of great episodes
[0:43:17] <derap41> Ska never dies
[0:43:18] <+SlumberMan> Didn't Nier teach you anything? Androids are notoriously racist towards other robots.
[0:43:18] <+Jontman42> Ska is dead
[0:43:19] <%Sphincter_Spelunker> ska came before reggae
[0:43:19] <%rumtumtugnutz> @Warbot You should check out One Pace. It's the anime paces to be more like the manga.
[0:43:20] <%StaceMcGate> FF13 doesn't get good at 30 hours, you simply escape the hallway after 30 hours
[0:43:20] <%ssjklyco> More like Star Drek
[0:43:21] <Warbot40> One Piece anime would've been fine if they didn't stretch everything out
[0:43:22] <+necrocannibal2> SKA NEVER DIES
[0:43:22] <filialpails> SHE'S NOT ON ANOTHER PLANET, SHE'S JUST BEYOND THE CURTAIN OF NIGHT

[0:43:35] <fruit_pie_the_magician> ANd yeah the one piece anime has been in the toilet for like ten years
[0:43:35] <Valentinius_Anodyne> Ska is the Alpha and Omega of music
[0:43:36] <+wydamn> @SirGO0SE I DOO know that!
[0:43:37] <%spiritofmojave> Easy breezy shows ska isn't dead
[0:43:38] <Dhurkst> @wydamn It's getting closer, though, just incredibly slowly.

[0:44:01] <%StaceMcGate> Hi Paige's mom
[0:44:03] <+razielhex> Ska is ridiculously popular in Eastern Europe. The most popular band in Russia in the last decade, for example, is the Ska band LENINGRAD.
[0:44:07] <%OwlLightningMage> Hi Paige's mom
[0:44:08] <$lotharrio> Data is a robot. Because if he was recognized as a person, they wouldn't have had to have a court case to justify not tearing him apart to see how he works. They'd have settled that before he went to the academy.

[1:02:41] <xxshadowxx416> if your 911
[1:02:42] <%RubberFistFight> Depending on how bad the burn is, letting it dry out will cause the skin around it to shrink and put tension on the wound, which impedes the healing process and increases the risk of scarring. So keep it moist with antiseptic ointment specifically designed for burns.
[1:02:44] <GarbageQueenEllie> Go to the Magic Option in your menu and choose "heal"
[1:02:45] <%MachineHead9> no LUL

[1:26:17] <%marvel877> He had a dog
[1:26:18] <Wall1ce> why Ndesu feet so big
[1:26:18] <devanmuse> Remember when Leon killed half a dozen of these guys with a fucking knife? And now you need two miniguns just to ice one
[1:26:19] <%joylent_blue> he did it with a DOG
[1:26:21] <%StaceMcGate> EL GIGANTE BLANCO
[1:26:21] <%Di0nin> Leon bought a rocket launcher for lik $5

[1:26:33] <%rytisone> This is The Rock of El Gigantes
[1:26:33] <Finakala> Even Ada knifed him to death
[1:26:35] <Doomstar16> I was wondering why the Gigante was even in this game.
[1:26:36] <%sniffy77> there must be a literal ton of bullets in him right now
[1:26:36] <%linSP> hey its that dog
[1:26:36] <%jorniev> HE ALSO STABED IT
[1:26:37] <%Neo_Kaiser> Why doesn't the El Gigante just walk around the jeep where they can't aim?
[1:26:37] <x00Leon> he cut it with his knife
[1:26:38] <%Grayhammatter> she's doing it!
[1:26:38] <%Sir_stride> he killed 3 of them
[1:26:38] <%sleepy_coffee> @PatStaresAt then again Leon could dodge these things and he had Heugi
[1:26:38] <TrollKing96> Is El Gigante's form reproducible? If so, why does Ndesu get shit?
[1:26:39] <nox_nyctores> It's that dog
[1:26:39] <$lotharrio> Plus the two in the lava room.
[1:26:39] <TheMrFountain> Dog was a big help.

[2:15:50] <derap41> The RPG the sniper the magnum while paige gets trash SMG and ok shogun
[2:15:56] <%RubberFistFight> @doc_ock_rokc oh luckily my house is SIGNIFICANTLY higher than the levels it flooded to even in the major floods of 2011 - we just get cut off from places for a while since a lot of the roads in and out are low-lying over rivers.
[2:15:59] <%misterspotswood> @Dame_90 you cant just show off the best part!
[2:16:02] <%TheActuallyGuy> So she gets the next magnum right? the one you find during the wesker fight?

[2:17:06] <%RubberFistFight> @King_Wolf_Rigger honestly it's been 10 years or so since the last MAJOR flood. This area of Australia gets minor-moderate floods on a roughly 10 year cycle, and a big one every 35 years or so. 2011 was the "big one", last time it did that was the late 70s.

[2:18:18] <%RubberFistFight> @King_Wolf_Rigger the whole south-east corner of Queensland, which is the state I live in, is a giant floodplain. It's on the banks of a river that likes to expand at the drop of a hat. Sure, it's smart for settlers to build on rivers because of the presence of fresh, flowing water, but man, they coulda built a bit higher.

[2:20:12] <%RubberFistFight> @King_Wolf_Rigger what's especially stupid is there's a type of house called a "queenslander", it's a house on stilts, designed to weather floods. The dipshits built a bunch of them in outlying streets that are technically level-with or LOWER than the river level - meaning the stilts are fucking pointless.
