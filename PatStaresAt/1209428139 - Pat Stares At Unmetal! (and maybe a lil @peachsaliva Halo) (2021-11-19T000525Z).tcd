[0:18:01] <littlest_light> RISE AND GRIME
[0:18:03] <+ReallyBigRocks> Halo is fun and cool
[0:18:05] <@Jekado> Fromsoftware will never make another Another Century Episode game, after R..... geefBlinds
[0:18:06] <moonmintparadise> Surprisingly good

[0:18:07] <ExpressNode> I'm gonna wait on SMT V. Heard the game runs a bad in a few areas
[0:18:08] <Dr_Mooose> its pretty fun
[0:18:08] <%LymanAl> is the grime efluvial?

[0:18:25] <%octotasty> Skewer?
[0:18:25] <%RealThiele> having to hook up the PS2 for SMT5 is cumbersome
[0:18:26] <+ReallyBigRocks> Mauler was the shotgun
[0:18:32] <KaitlynnHere> When I read that podcast title I legit thought you were going to talk about Grimes too
[0:18:40] <%cooldude69xx> needler?
[0:18:42] <+Caboose2492> those brute pistols
[0:18:43] <+ReallyBigRocks> Spiker was the auto with knives
[0:18:45] <+Caboose2492> or smgs
[0:18:45] <%doomunderthestairs> the spiker was the brute auto weapon
[0:18:45] <%Treuan> Spiker was good
[0:18:45] <%cade_calrayn> @SoFarFetched Pat is like Crazy Talk, if you try to force him to do something he'll do the opposite
[0:18:48] <Daxalog> Lots of guns have been removes
[0:18:48] <oozebear> Spiker fuckin whips ass
[0:18:50] <+xXRealGamerThaigeXx> the spiker was cool as shit but sucked ass
[0:18:51] <marvel877> Spiker
[0:18:54] <+BigCoffee> Mauler was a 1 handed shotgun
[0:18:56] <Tracazoid> I like the spike grenades as well, not stickies but still fun
[0:19:04] <Daxalog> They wont.
[0:19:13] <Dio_TR> Yo @patstaresat are you gonna main Jake the dog to fight Larry David in the WB smash game
[0:19:14] <%kyh9> They probably will
[0:19:15] <%AHomeschoolDropout> The new brute pistol is pretty good though. It's a pocket sniper than can 3 shot consistently, don't even need a headshot to one shot
[0:19:16] <oozebear> BABY TIME
[0:19:18] <Treasure_Vault> I can't wait till they add darth vader
[0:19:18] <%RAGING_1NF3RNO> they might bring those weapons back.
[0:19:19] <+ReallyBigRocks> I doubt this is the full weapon list
[0:19:24] <Profmcstevie> Maybe Halo 1 pistol will return and ruin everyones fun
[0:19:24] <KaitlynnHere> No
[0:19:25] <%cade_calrayn> *is* it confirmed that Infinite's multiplayer is gonna be free after the game is released?

[0:19:39] <%doomunderthestairs> cum in hair can be tough
[0:19:41] <%JohnMcClanesBrother> Gross
[0:19:52] <%cade_calrayn> @ReallyBigRocks that's fucking awesome
[0:20:00] <KaitlynnHere> Maybe even a gentle… man
[0:20:04] <+ReallyBigRocks> @Dakuu75 they shoot out bouncy spikes perpendicular to whatever they're stuck to
[0:20:05] <%valriot> There are some weapons not in the MP right now, like THE BIG DICK, SAW
[0:20:06] <%DedlokPM> @cade_calrayn yes. they literally said when they announced infinite that the multiplayer will be free and campaign will be paid for
[0:20:06] <%BallerSwagBro9k> IS PAIGE A CANINE?

[0:23:17] <%tanarath> And Valve, gotta stop Steam.
[0:23:17] <penitentpendant> Let people keep their IPs. We don't need one person owning them all for a 'metaverse'
[0:23:18] <%DedlokPM> But Meta has nothing to do with Google or Apple.

[0:26:20] <bigshedman> What's bad about Vanguard? Out of the loop on CoD...
[0:26:23] <%scaryboisupreme> No it's just free ala Infinite
[0:26:23] <+LowBatteryLife> Activision absolutely killing it.
[0:26:23] <%KeiganOfAstora> Vanguard is dumb, everyone is tired of WW2
[0:26:23] <%CappuccinoGuil> FOR THE GAMERS, PAT
[0:26:23] <%AHomeschoolDropout> Kotaku made an article about how it basically erased all discrimination during that period
[0:26:24] <KaitlynnHere> Let’s play it, see how bads
[0:26:24] <%baka_sugoi> its basic BF stuff
[0:26:27] <%BallerSwagBro9k> VANGUARD IS A DUMPSTER FIRE
[0:26:28] <ape_hawk> well, its about minorities in ww2, so of course activision didnt advertise it
[0:26:29] <%JoshManVGH> Yeah! It's a trashfire!
[0:26:29] <%Dakuu75> free these nutz~
[0:26:30] <+RyTYoung> Giga boots played the campaign, 4 out of 5 of the missions are flashbacks
[0:26:32] <%kyh9> To be fair, Warzone takes a lot of the steam out of annual CoD releases
[0:26:34] <%RealThiele> CoD is finally dying huzzah
[0:26:38] <KaitlynnHere> Gotta shoot the global warming
[0:26:39] <%DianaTheAscian> OH BOY HAVE THEY
[0:26:40] <ExpressNode> Never played it but with Halo coming out it's got stiff competition
[0:26:43] <%GabeSweetMan> Eat shit Bobby boy
[0:26:43] <+ReallyBigRocks> I feel like I've teleported into 2008
[0:26:46] <%RayReborne> Dice has mixed games too
[0:26:46] <@Ranryu692> 4 was terrible, and I've hear nothing good about 5
[0:26:47] <%KeiganOfAstora> Free what?
[0:26:50] <+megaman_sentinel> halo is fucking them hard
[0:27:01] <+GeneralGray8> Yes
[0:27:01] <Yakobro> yes
[0:27:02] <+ReallyBigRocks> Free forever and ever
[0:27:02] <%Djinnazz> i think so
[0:27:02] <KnivesEve> yes
[0:27:02] <%AHomeschoolDropout> yes
[0:27:03] <%RayReborne> Fucking hardline was weird from hearing about it at the time
[0:27:03] <%OG_M_Bison> Yes it will be
[0:27:04] <%valriot> to be fair, 343 only bad 1 bad Halo game lmao
[0:27:05] <%tanarath> The multiplayer will be good & free
[0:27:05] <%baka_sugoi> it should?
[0:27:06] <%Dakuu75> I think so?
[0:27:06] <%KeiganOfAstora> Battlefield games never have great launches
[0:27:06] <%DianaTheAscian> Yes
[0:27:07] <%barrakuta371> yes
[0:27:07] <+xXRealGamerThaigeXx> yes
[0:27:08] <+Roflmag> pretty sure they said it would
[0:27:10] <%kyh9> Yes
[0:27:15] <Profmcstevie> yes, they said it's JUST free
[0:27:15] <%kyh9> It's free forever basically
[0:27:16] <%RealThiele> they wanna steal fortnites lunch
[0:27:16] <@Ranryu692> @valriot two
[0:27:17] <+Sadira_snack_attack> yarb
[0:27:23] <Noble8TE> yes
[0:27:23] <%valriot> Yeah it's free forever
[0:27:24] <+ReallyBigRocks> considering the beta was a complete surprise too
[0:27:24] <%maskofmichael> your face?
[0:27:25] <%BallerSwagBro9k> yes
[0:27:25] <KaitlynnHere> Are you kidding me?
[0:27:31] <ZaCrimsonDragon> tskr
[0:27:31] <%GabeSweetMan> Nice.
[0:27:32] <Gorgs7> yeah, they're relying on battlepass/microtransaction bullshit
[0:27:33] <KaitlynnHere> Who’d play for a beta?!
[0:27:35] <%DedlokPM> They said when they announced Halo Infinite that the Campaign will be paid for and multiplayer will be free
[0:27:36] <%valriot> Its only the campaign and some bonus stuff that's paid
[0:27:37] <Teras_ode> Just to put it out there, Tim didn't actually SAY that, but personally I sure felt like that's his attitude when you compare his arguments to the actions he has taken with the store
[0:27:38] <KaitlynnHere> Pay
[0:27:39] <%JoshManVGH> And I've never been more willing to throw money at a thing.
[0:27:43] <+ReallyBigRocks> it takes longer for everyone to load in than it does to find a lobby LUL
[0:27:45] <%dekkitout> Eta in the buffer overflow
[0:27:46] <Profmcstevie> "I've never been this popular"
[0:27:46] <scrumbotime> The other day I tried to play Apex and it took me like, 8 minutes to find a match, so I think they all left to play halo
[0:27:48] <%RayReborne> EVEN NOW
[0:27:54] <commanderapathy> y'all whippersnappers playin the haler?
[0:27:59] <%Ziegsy> like ff14 and the PVP timer
[0:28:01] <bakkatohri> Halo with a F2P model? How long before they add a hot girl or some kind of mascot and give them like a thousand skins?
[0:28:02] <%RealThiele> halo might be popular
[0:28:03] <@Moobot> Hey folks, just a reminder! If you have Twitch connected to Discord, you can access the PSA Sub-Discord. Go to your User Settings, go to Connections, and click 'Join' on the PSA server under the Twitch connection.
[0:28:03] <%CappuccinoGuil> At least Halo doesn't change real world war crimes committed by real armies in favor of blaming another country to sell propaganda. *cough* highway of death cough*
[0:28:05] <%Ziegsy> its been 5 mins for 2 hours
[0:28:06] <DXLelouch24> Ya know whats also gonna be free? Multiversus
[0:28:08] <%BallerSwagBro9k> Das Good
[0:28:10] <%tanarath> That's a REALLY good bug to have.
[0:28:13] <%kyh9> It should just ask "Would you like to play?"
[0:28:15] <SummonerMagno> just give permission to stream to hololive and you are set
[0:28:15] <KaitlynnHere> That’s actually nice
[0:28:16] <%baka_sugoi> SLAYER
[0:28:23] <RyuuAoi> Peach Halo hype!
[0:28:24] <%Bluwizard21> but i wanna play oddball

[0:29:29] <%CheesesSliced> Holy balls
[0:29:31] <%CappuccinoGuil> Pat, I've been trying to fight Ramuh EX for 3 days, waiting a total of FOUR HOURS. That's some mad wait lines LUL
[0:29:31] <%blistexthief> Deathloop has multiplayer?
[0:29:31] <+Sadira_snack_attack> but its the game of the year
[0:29:32] <%baka_sugoi> PAIMON
[0:29:39] <IvanMistwalker> what game?
[0:29:40] <%Supermonaman> Supermonaman subscribed at Tier 1. They've subscribed for 27 months, currently on a 27 month streak! Love your stuff. This game is actually the best thing ever. Keep up the great work. :-) <3
[0:29:43] <%RealThiele> Arkane continues making cool poor selling games

[0:29:57] <%DedlokPM> @baka_sugoi HungryPaimon
[0:29:57] <KaitlynnHere> Classical music
[0:29:57] <bakkatohri> Games with dead multiplayer components that have achievements tied to the dead multiplayer are the worst.  LIke I can't even 100% Dark Souls 2... I have to rely on 0.001% drops to raise covenant levels...
[0:29:57] <+Shady_Zaku> Gayme On
[0:30:00] <%real_life_ghost> real_life_ghost subscribed with Prime. They've subscribed for 9 months, currently on a 1 month streak! Nine months? Sub baby! Grinding fishing relic tonight, on the final step, wish me luck on getting the 400 things I need...
[0:30:12] <%GabeSweetMan> All I want is the ability to repair them.
[0:30:15] <%dekkitout> Fun tip, weapon spawns improve as more enemies are killed
[0:30:15] <+BigCoffee> I still dont get why people like BOTW
[0:30:16] <%baka_sugoi> @baka_sugoi psaDab
[0:30:17] <Dio_TR> !followage
[0:30:25] <KaitlynnHere> My goblins only apply to real life shit
[0:30:26] <%RayReborne> People find ways to goblin it up anyway, yeah
[0:30:27] <moonmintparadise> Elden Ring already did it better with giving you other things besides weapons as loot
[0:30:28] <Profmcstevie> It's a solution to a problem I don't CAAARE about
[0:30:29] <%RealThiele> triple that durability
[0:30:29] <%kyh9> It REALLY picks at the goblins
[0:30:30] <@Ranryu692> I have seen a LOT of ardent defenders of it
[0:30:31] <+ReallyBigRocks> yeah it's just an annoyance
[0:30:34] <Gorgs7> that and rain when you were climbing some shit
[0:30:38] <KaitlynnHere> Like making a dentist appointment an shit
[0:30:39] <bob900000> yeah
[0:30:40] <%king_wragles> Hey, I saw that Zullie video too!
[0:30:42] <%justcallmebobplease> It'd be fine if it wasn't so quick - like, triple-time decay or whatnot, and I'd be content.
[0:30:42] <%kyh9> JUST LET ME REPAIR
[0:30:45] <%notsoy> not quite universal, but it is the thing most often complained about
[0:30:47] <%Ziegsy> @BigCoffee field simulator with one goblin camp repeated every mile or so
[0:30:47] <%valriot> Its not even a problem, people are just a bit baby amount it
[0:30:47] <RyuuAoi> BOTW is fun. It's just BIG and the drafting was a little meh.
[0:30:47] <+NohbdyIsCrash> I thought the worse part was the terrible boss fights?
[0:30:48] <+GeneralGray8> I think there should be a vendor that you can buy weapons from for mats in BOTW
[0:30:49] <+Shady_Zaku> yeah it seemed dumb to me
[0:30:50] <%BinaryFireball> it was doing weird things
[0:30:50] <%kyh9> JUST LET ME GRIND SHIT WEAPONS INTO MY GOOD WEAPON
[0:30:51] <%JohnMcClanesBrother> Your offline
[0:30:51] <moonmintparadise> it makes me not want to use weapons at the fear of wasting them on garbage
[0:30:52] <+Rofiarf> i actually like it
[0:30:53] <%baka_sugoi> no
[0:30:54] <+GeneralGray8> No
[0:30:54] <%BinaryFireball> seems ok now

[0:31:01] <ExpressNode> No?
[0:31:01] <%GabeSweetMan> I sorta like being forced to switch weapons.... but I don't like LOSING THEM FOREVER.

[0:31:26] <RyuuAoi> I died
[0:31:28] <KaitlynnHere> Stream got gay
[0:31:29] <%dekkitout> Despite by time you hit hyrule castle, a third of the weapons are better than wht you found
[0:31:31] <%BinaryFireball> so what happened with streamalbs anyways?
[0:31:32] <%RealThiele> ded
[0:31:36] <%tanarath> If the weapons were split between permanent weapons & non-permanents with 50%+ more damage, it'd be interesting. it's not
[0:31:39] <XelanArdel> a large amount of people will defend it by saying that it is needed to get you to try different weapon types.
[0:31:40] <bakkatohri> Chilly stuff? Chili stuff???
[0:31:44] <%GabeSweetMan> Drained his life energy
[0:31:47] <penitentpendant> Dog turn to off mode

[0:43:51] <%barrakuta371> oh that kinda fake

[0:43:55] <%RealThiele> low cost contractors baybee
[0:43:56] <Treasure_Vault> Depends on the city, and the part of the city. Also, LA will look fake because that's where TV is shot.

[1:15:58] <%RayReborne> Hi one guy welcome to psaGoblin

[1:15:59] <jorniev> its just like snake and the tranq gun
[1:16:01] <@Ranryu692> then you'd deserve your game over screen
[1:16:01] <%doomunderthestairs> exactly

[1:16:09] <%HotSauceFiend> This reload goblin must have come from somewhere
[1:16:10] <eustine> Git gudder then.
[1:16:14] <%RealThiele> nut ten times in a row
[1:16:14] <Dunmarkh> if you miss the shot ten times in a row you need to hand in your gamer card
[1:16:22] <jorniev> what is this secret base?
[1:16:25] <akitanito> this game has reflections!
[1:16:37] <+OhioNitsud> when has cheating ever stopped you Pat?

[1:19:14] <%afronooch> LUL
[1:19:49] <%doomunderthestairs> that's right
[1:19:50] <%MidnightBurst12> brain is large but smooth
[1:20:37] <%DedlokPM> @PatStaresAt If you don't use the thermal suit at all during that fire sequence you get a cutscene where the interrogator asks why you didn't use the suit your character says that you forgot about it. Then the interrogator says "And yet you still remembered it enough to mention it earlier" and then you respond "The mind works in mysterious ways"
[1:20:48] <+ReallyBigRocks> Like an ostrich egg but bigger

[1:23:14] <%SirGO0SE> phantom scrote
[1:23:15] <%A_Zealous_Retort> that was what the phantom pain was actually about, he was in a coma so long he forgot about blue balls
[1:23:16] <%FunkyStreams> but I can say i already approve
[1:23:16] <+DuskSymphony01> "like the phantom pain but for your balls" might be one of the most 'pat' things ever said
[1:23:19] <%notsoy> what was that bullet slot thing, a mag extension?
[1:23:20] <%SinnerEbru> phantom ball pain was my favorite jojo arc
[1:23:20] <ToneBacas> the phantom balls
[1:23:26] <Teras_ode> Venom Zangief, a Pupper Denied his Nut

[1:23:34] <%NigelSchnauzerpug> What's the stupidest thing you said as a kid pat?
[1:23:38] <CanadianAnimatorGuy> "The baby looked at you?"
[1:23:39] <%SirGO0SE> they all laughed and think of that weird thing you said every day
[1:23:39] <%MidnightBurst12> every night...I can feel my balls...
[1:23:39] <%Dakuu75> if you don't regret ANYTHING in your life, it's because you're a psycopath
[1:23:42] <TioXyco> ironic talking about Phatom Pain while playing a MGS inspired game LUL
[1:23:45] <%RayReborne> But Pat, you said stupid shit TODAY Kappa

[1:24:08] <%NigelSchnauzerpug> And you STILL hate cats.
[1:24:09] <jorniev> in the shade fox kinda looks like snake from mgs1

[1:24:36] <+ReallyBigRocks> shoulder cats are cool
[1:24:36] <KaitlynnHere> Who doesn’t? I’d looked at my yearbook from high school and it was very very very cringy
[1:24:37] <%RayReborne> The Cat i grew up with was a grumpy jerk but he loved me the most
[1:24:38] <%tanarath> About half of cats are sociable.
[1:24:40] <%shurtal> a friendly cat is better than a friendly dog, cause a friendly dog can push you around, a friendly cat is still small enough that you can take it in a kindness fight if you need to
[1:24:42] <Zeif00> Elmo seems like he has a nice timer

[1:37:34] <%Dakuu75> , Paige doesn't let him look at guides anymore
[1:37:54] <MikeyxStyles> puzzle goblins
[1:38:01] <Gorgs7> Mine detectors should have a magnet in them, with which you can rub on the wire to magnetize it, then compass
[1:38:07] <%maskofmichael> @Dakuu75 I thought that was only stat building guides
[1:38:09] <triangularblasphemy> @NigelSchnauzerpug Its low tier! Go find yourself a new holiday tradition, culinary pathfinding!
[1:38:10] <+BedHome> obviously you gotta combine the wire with the health kit, then use the health wire, which lets you combine it with your body, thus placing the wire in your mouth
[1:38:12] <Gorgs7> just guessing
[1:38:33] <%A_Zealous_Retort> @Gorgs7 that makes too much sense for this game
[1:39:01] <triangularblasphemy> I wanted it to cut to his obliterated dental work after he mentioned biting the wire

[1:39:37] <triangularblasphemy> @NigelSchnauzerpug Oh there are some good people in this chat
[1:39:47] <%A_Zealous_Retort> @BedHome read the compass the instructions from the medkit to give it a medical education then stab yourself with the wire to invoke the hippocratic oath and make it help you
[1:40:16] <%RayReborne> @a_zealous_retort lol. lmao
[1:40:17] <%NigelSchnauzerpug> @NigelSchnauzerpug Some people say that culinary 3.5e is better than 5e.
[1:40:20] <+CapnClassix> Check the back of the game box for the right frequency to call Amazon and order a new compass
[1:43:10] <%Dakuu75> @CapnClassix THAT sounds like possible opotion for this game

[1:57:58] <%cade_calrayn> He has transcended the need for commerce
[1:58:02] <%Broand> Crypto is a reaction to the lack of control that people feel regarding where the worlds headed, It's why the scams are always about decentralization and forming a "community"

[2:38:53] <%barrakuta371> I wish Sony would just buy Metal Gear from Konami, but that's probably not going to happen
[2:38:55] <otakon17> don't forget to put on the vest!

[2:39:20] <+xerotwo> LUL
[2:39:20] <KaironFortressKnight> @PatStaresAt Out of curiosity, do you have a similar situation as Max, where playing off stream has become weird?
[2:39:20] <HaroldDonchee> fuck now I'm just mike...
[2:39:21] <ape_hawk> that was just vulcan raven
[2:39:27] <%HotSauceFiend> and the patrol didnt hear the grenades at all
[2:39:27] <bakkatohri> Konami will milk every property they have for pachinko if it has brand recognition
[2:39:28] <%NopeBadguy> @NopeBadguy metal gear solid died in that tanker 2 years ago...
[2:39:33] <%HotSauceFiend> or the machine gun
[2:39:36] <ape_hawk> now you have to beat him in an ear-puilling contest
[2:39:47] <%RayReborne> probably
[2:39:47] <ape_hawk> i can emulate your mom
[2:39:47] <Visorak6> Probably?
[2:39:48] <%tanarath> YES
[2:39:49] <$Futurecity10> @PatStaresAt MGS 1 and 2 are on GOG
[2:39:50] <otakon17> probably?
[2:39:51] <Daxalog> You mean "upscale"
[2:39:52] <%NigelSchnauzerpug> You could probably emulate anything.
[2:39:52] <+TungstenViper> yes
[2:39:52] <+xerotwo> maybe....?
[2:39:54] <%NopeBadguy> you can probably emulate all the ps3 games
[2:39:54] <SaltyAzteca> .........its possible
[2:39:55] <%baka_sugoi> yeah
[2:39:56] <Teras_ode> most probably
[2:39:57] <%RayReborne> YAR
[2:39:57] <+doe3879> there's no PC version?
[2:39:57] <%MidnightBurst12> of course not Kappa
[2:39:57] <%maskofmichael> Not legally
[2:39:58] <otakon17> the PS3? probably not
[2:39:59] <Dio_TR> Yea
[2:40:01] <jorniev> not yet
[2:40:02] <%afronooch> I'm not sure about 4, but the others yeah prob
[2:40:02] <XelanArdel> yes, it emulates well enough
[2:40:03] <MyNameIsRasus> Upscalable
[2:40:03] <+CapnClassix> PS2 emulation
[2:40:05] <%tanarath> Ps3 ones are hard to do.
[2:40:06] <GarbageNirvana> Don't see why they wouldn't be
[2:40:07] <%JoshManVGH> Creepy Porpoise played them recently
[2:40:10] <%RayReborne> Yar Matey, probably
[2:40:11] <%Sotetsu> Hey Pat, which which versions of silent hill 1, 2, and 3 should I play?
[2:40:14] <%chiazam> yeah but not well
[2:40:20] <%tanarath> MGS 1 & 2 are easily emulateable
[2:40:23] <%afronooch> The Ps2 and PSP ones should be absolutely doable
[2:40:24] <otakon17> just "acquire" the PS2 games and use the patented UPSCALER CONSOLE
[2:40:25] <%blankwaffle> it's on psnow
[2:40:29] <%Ne1son> PS3 is hard to emulate
[2:40:29] <DXLelouch24> RPCS3  probably
[2:40:30] <HaroldDonchee> awesome duck. now he's tank Mike
[2:40:32] <SomeAsianDood> The HD collection. Kappa @Sotetsu
[2:40:35] <otakon17> you need dat bazooka!
[2:40:35] <Dio_TR> Lmaoooo
[2:40:36] <Teras_ode> it really is Vulcan Raven
[2:40:37] <Kraidn> Mod them to not be terrible?
[2:40:38] <%NopeBadguy> @Sotetsu original hardware for 1 and 3, pc with fan remaster for 2
[2:40:41] <Dio_TR> It’s just Vulcan raven
[2:40:42] <+TungstenViper> compatabilty is still not up to par but it's playable

[2:43:38] <%FunkyStreams> the surface armor is pretty good pat.
[2:43:38] <%barrakuta371> I thought the barrels would explode tbh
[2:43:40] <+EyeFarted> THEY WERE WAIST HIGH BARRELS
[2:43:40] <$realm_forge> HEADSHOT
[2:43:43] <%A_Zealous_Retort> oil barrels do not contain spare rockets i guess
[2:43:43] <otakon17> the crates are STACKED HIGH
[2:43:47] <cnry_m> 50 50 shot
[2:43:47] <%FunkyStreams> Here's a tip, most tanks are rear engined

[2:45:06] <%HotSauceFiend> yeah can you imagine hiding behind barrels
[2:45:14] <+Shady_Zaku> But he's destroying all the trucks?
[2:45:22] <%FunkyStreams> armored cars
[2:45:24] <Daxalog> The occupants of tanks are its soul
[2:45:24] <otakon17> WOO!
[2:45:25] <%SinnerEbru> noice!!
[2:45:25] <%FunkyStreams> not tanks
[2:45:25] <+Fooguwu> well, and all their internal flammable parts
[2:45:26] <otakon17> Victory!
[2:45:28] <%A_Zealous_Retort> molotovs were invented because the people hated molotov
[2:45:29] <%asgard147> limesYay
[2:45:36] <cnry_m> 1940 engines could overheat though
[2:45:38] <+Fooguwu> and blow up the explosives inside
[2:45:38] <HaroldDonchee> how would that work unless you threw it inside?
[2:45:40] <+M0untain_wolf> Not snek
[2:45:49] <+ThomasOfTroy> They're kinda meant to fuck up the treads and immobilize tanks
[2:45:52] <%doc_ock_rokc> Fun fact molotovs were named during the holodomor
[2:45:59] <akitanito> you cover the tank in fire and burn away the oxygen
[2:46:01] <Zaphire_Saucypants> Don't ask questions.
[2:46:03] <%asgard147> limesDance limesDance limesDance
[2:46:04] <%Maids4lyfe> @HaroldDonchee the heat from the fire would cook the inside like an oven
[2:46:04] <otakon17> @HaroldDonchee fire has a way of heating up fuel and munitions

[2:58:09] <@Moobot> Hey folks, just a reminder! If you have Twitch connected to Discord, you can access the PSA Sub-Discord. Go to your User Settings, go to Connections, and click 'Join' on the PSA server under the Twitch connection.
[2:58:09] <Teras_ode> only if you wanna play those games I gues?
[2:58:11] <%RayReborne> YEAH METAL GEAR
[2:58:14] <jorniev> FABLE 2
[2:58:14] <@Ranryu692> Metal Gear 2 isn't on Xbox though?
[2:58:14] <KaiserMario> Can you play MGS4 on xbox?
[2:58:15] <supergoblinpunch> Otogi too
[2:58:19] <%barrakuta371> You could even play Otogi
[2:58:19] <$realm_forge> I’m playing modded Skyrimon mine right now
[2:58:21] <otakon17> you could play Lord of the Rings The Third Age and Demon Stone!
[2:58:21] <%JoshManVGH> i would say a OneS is good enough, but with the 4K tv....
[2:58:21] <%FunkyStreams> I sold railroad bonds to my ps3 at launch.
[2:58:22] <%doomunderthestairs> that HD collection
[2:58:27] <%tanarath> It can be useful, but look at emulation first
[2:58:28] <srv4254> SNAKE EATER PLS
[2:58:29] <Zaphire_Saucypants> Fuck, I miss old Splinter Cell games.
[2:58:30] <Kraidn> The only reason why I could think of to get an Xbox 360 is so one could play Fable 2, thx to it being broke everywhere else
[2:58:31] <%NigelSchnauzerpug> Like Metal Gear SOlid 5, the best one!
[2:58:32] <+JustToWatch> You can finally stream Asura's Wrath
[2:58:39] <KaiserMario> LUL
[2:58:39] <%RayReborne> RIGHT, FUCK
[2:58:40] <otakon17> someone clip that
[2:58:41] <%Bluwizard21> god i wish fable 2 wouldcome to steam
[2:58:41] <%doomunderthestairs> yeah 4 is still trapped
[2:58:44] <%SaiyanShoto> Fuck it, force it into the schedule then
[2:58:46] <Mattais88> Why can't they just port it!
[2:58:46] <%NopeBadguy> @PatStaresAt You can emulate HD collection and 4
[2:58:46] <@Ranryu692> I'm glad it hasn't fit into the schedule. gives me time to find my PS3 and play them myself
[2:58:47] <bakkatohri> @PatStaresAt PlayStation Now has every Metal Gear Solid available on there including the HD collection.
[2:58:57] <%JoshManVGH> That didn't come to the collection?
[2:59:04] <bakkatohri> And it's for PC
[2:59:05] <%machshop> LUL
[2:59:06] <marvel877> Metal Gear on Xbox doesn't have the analog pressure sensitive buttons, Pat.
[2:59:06] <%SinnerEbru> i also got the 360 for Fable 2! that game brought me back into gaming
[2:59:07] <%kyh9> And you have to stream over Playstation Now
[2:59:07] <otakon17> yeah but PSNow relies on CLOUD GAMING
[2:59:07] <bakkatohri> easier to stream, maybe?
[2:59:07] <%SaiyanShoto> Switch out NMH3 for Metal Gear LUL
[2:59:09] <Mattais88> But not Playstation store
[2:59:11] <%RetroCop87> no they don't, Konami took them down
[2:59:13] <%RayReborne> I wouldnt pay for Now either Pat, its ok
[2:59:13] <bakkatohri> Because it's not a PS3
[2:59:19] <otakon17> meaning your internet needs to be PREMIUM to play it properly
[2:59:21] <%FunkyStreams> yee
[2:59:21] <%SaiyanShoto> PSNow is awful
[2:59:24] <%JoshManVGH> Oh that would be a trip, streaming a streamed game
[2:59:25] <%Sotetsu> Yay, Halo!
[2:59:27] <%FunkyStreams> big shoot, big man
[2:59:29] <%machshop> people in halo gettin super sweaty alrready
[2:59:31] <%NopeBadguy> I'm glad this game is making you miss Metal Gear like I am @PatStaresAt
[2:59:32] <%AHomeschoolDropout> You can't get the HD collections 'cause they've been taken down by Konami
[2:59:33] <%DianaTheAscian> is there anyway easy way to play those games where I can actually own them?
[2:59:39] <bakkatohri> I've played through Bloodborne and God of War on PlayStation now.
[2:59:43] <%barrakuta371> Paige make big noise
[2:59:43] <bakkatohri> It's actually good.
[2:59:45] <%RayReborne> You can download games off of PSNow
[2:59:46] <KaiserMario> @PatStaresAt Have you played the OG Metal Gears? 2 Is really good
[2:59:49] <jorniev> CONCRETE
[2:59:49] <cnry_m> Giant concrete
[2:59:50] <akitanito> it all comes together!
[2:59:50] <+ThomasOfTroy> K-278 is an actual nuclear submarine that sank and with missiles onboard and during salvage operations, it was discovered that the silo doors had been pried open and the missiles were missing. I can't believe they're pulling that into this game
[2:59:50] <PanicSwytch> THICC
[2:59:55] <%SaiyanShoto> @dianatheascian PS3
[2:59:56] <otakon17> the story is coming together...
[2:59:56] <%chiazam> @PatStaresAt I'm confused, you don't want to use the PS3 to play MGS?
[3:00:00] <%afronooch> @RayReborne not every game
[3:00:00] <HaroldDonchee> oh noo
[3:00:04] <otakon17> Colonel, no!
[3:00:06] <%JoshManVGH> @dianatheascian How do you feel about seamanship?
[3:00:11] <Teras_ode> cavalier?
[3:00:13] <otakon17> >the cavalier
[3:00:13] <%RetroCop87> Whenever I hear Paige moving around, it sounds like she's stepping on legos
[3:00:16] <%machshop> cavalier?
[3:00:16] <RyuuAoi> @patstaresat Is the chili ready? I'm hangry!
[3:00:25] <%RayReborne> @afronooch didnt know it wasn't every game, thank you
[3:00:28] <%SveriSageAdvice> HDCP
[3:00:29] <jorniev> @ThomasOfTroy HOLY SHIT
[3:00:30] <+Shady_Zaku> COLONEL?? COLONEL?? COLONEEEELLLL
[3:00:32] <%tanarath> @thomasoftroy Just crazy enough for a Metal Gear game, though
[3:00:35] <ExpressNode> Yep
[3:00:41] <marvel877> GOOD LUCK STREAMING PS3
[3:00:46] <%captainpodock> what makes it so difficult?
[3:00:49] <KaiserMario> yeah, it's not like it's your job or anything...
[3:00:50] <%afronooch> @RayReborne I accidentally bought a year of PSNow and discovering that made it so much worse lol
[3:00:50] <%FunkyStreams> Sony worked really hard to make sure the ps3 didnt sell.
[3:00:53] <RyuuAoi> You should do MGS3 though...
[3:00:54] <%SaiyanShoto> So even after all the work you went through it still won’t work?
[3:00:55] <%SveriSageAdvice> the HDCP stops you
[3:00:56] <%FunkyStreams> I mean cell*
[3:00:57] <%KineticZen> HDCP for one
[3:00:58] <@Ranryu692> just break out the camcorder
[3:01:06] <%SinnerEbru> does that issue also exist on the ps2?
[3:01:06] <akitanito> LUL
[3:01:07] <%chiazam> I forgot Pat can't play games unless he streams them
[3:01:10] <%RetroCop87> @PatStaresAt how's PS3 emulation on your machine?
[3:01:11] <%chiazam> what a nightmare
[3:01:14] <jorniev> LUL
[3:01:19] <HaroldDonchee> a sarcophagus? like the one for mike?
[3:01:19] <%DianaTheAscian> @JoshManVGH seamanship?
[3:01:20] <otakon17> I love the writing this
[3:01:23] <%RayReborne> woo Camcorder Lets plays baybee Kappa
[3:01:31] <%KineticZen> There are somewhat illegal HDCP strippers out there but they often screw with the signal
[3:01:32] <SaltyAzteca> alliteration!
[3:01:34] <@SoFarFetched> stream on your phone again geefPlz
[3:01:45] <+king_of_beggars> A nuclear submarine? Did you smoke something?
[3:01:53] <Zaphire_Saucypants> *wink*
[3:01:58] <@SoFarFetched> Ive had to deal with HDCP during tech shows.
[3:02:01] <%tanarath> A SUNKEN SOVIET SUBMARINE?!?
[3:02:05] <%FunkyStreams> China
[3:02:07] <KaiserMario> You know what's really hard Pat? Roofing in July... You're complaining about playng good games cause it's mildly annoying to set it up
[3:02:10] <%FunkyStreams> untapped market
[3:02:16] <%SinnerEbru> OH VIDEO GAME DRM now i get it
[3:02:16] <Art__Thief> What's HDCP stripping?
[3:02:17] <%kyh9> Yes
[3:02:23] <%kyh9> Just watch MGS4 online
[3:02:24] <Dunmarkh> Just play revengeance
[3:02:25] <%DianaTheAscian> Wasn't there a whole podcast segment about those spliters?
[3:02:25] <%CalderGaming> mgs4 can be sloooooow
[3:02:26] <Daxalog> I like how this is making you want to play MGS
[3:02:26] <%doomunderthestairs> I mean its more of a movie than a game anyway
[3:02:27] <%baka_sugoi> MGS MOVIE STREAM
[3:02:30] <%rDAKODAc> You could use RPCS3
[3:02:31] <ape_hawk> you dont PLAY mgs4, pat
[3:02:37] <%linSP> wasnt mgs4 JUST the cutscenes on the old channel
[3:02:37] <ape_hawk> no one does
[3:02:37] <%RetroCop87> =O
[3:02:38] <%RayReborne> yeah 4 while having nice gameplay elements is super unnecessary to play
[3:02:39] <Visorak6> Isnt it like 12 hours of cutscenes?
[3:02:40] <jorniev> yeah i get it
[3:02:40] <DXLelouch24> RPCS3 runs the HD collection i checked
[3:02:40] <bakkatohri> I tried playing MGS3 again. I had a strong urge to skip all codec conversations.
[3:02:41] <+CrimsonDio11> @PatStaresAt if you did a MGS series would you play Phantom Pain?
[3:02:41] <%AHomeschoolDropout> Wasn't there a "lost LP" where you guys did a lets watch but never finished?
[3:02:42] <%NigelSchnauzerpug> THen play 3
[3:02:42] <akitanito> MGS4 is a movie
[3:02:44] <Mattais88> Then lose the last half of the footage right? keep the joke going?
[3:02:45] <%NopeBadguy> @PatStaresAt Are you sure it's not because you beelined it in a single night
[3:02:45] <+Shady_Zaku> How come?
[3:02:45] <%SaiyanShoto> It’ll be our own version of a watch party LUL
[3:02:46] <%SveriSageAdvice> @KaiserMario bruh, really?
[3:02:48] <KaironFortressKnight> play MGR instead
[3:02:49] <%DianaTheAscian> @PatStaresAt more than 5?
[3:02:53] <Jmann1892> oh come on. MGS4 is a pretty good movie
[3:02:53] <%valriot> MGS4 and MGSV are completely opposites of each other
[3:02:53] <PanicSwytch> MGS4 is 90% cutscene
[3:02:56] <%afronooch> I watched a playthrough and i feel like it was basically the same as playing it lol
[3:02:59] <+king_of_beggars> why not just stream someone else streaming it?
[3:03:00] <marvel877> Wait wait wait wait... You can PLAY MGS4? As a game?!
[3:03:04] <jorniev> I LIKE mgs4, BUT i get it man
[3:03:06] <KaiserMario> @SveriSageAdvice LUL yeah LUL LUL
[3:03:11] <%SaiyanShoto> Then no need to hook up a PS3 just play the old ones on an Xbox and ignore 4

[3:03:27] <bakkatohri> MGS4 has the weakest stealth elements in the genre and that Assassin's Creed style tailing mission was the worst.

[3:37:01] <@Ranryu692> who isn't a Halo veteran?
[3:37:03] <+セビー> bison!,
[3:37:03] <bakkatohri> Are you guys playing against other PC players? Because that might be the reason.
[3:37:05] <MyNameIsRasus> oh the gamer salt is coming out
[3:37:06] <otakon17> they may be vets but Paige you ARE new to this
[3:37:13] <+TopTieramisu> paige: pat's friend
[3:37:15] <holyxgrale> 1 minute into the match and already max anger FeelsBadMan
[3:37:16] <+pmtriox> also controller auto aim is super enhanced like MCC is
[3:37:16] <+ItalianWaifu> i mean possibly many people here have been playing halo for years
[3:37:16] <AsleepAura> Friendzoned
[3:37:17] <%barrakuta371> Might want to start Paige with the bots
[3:37:18] <RyuuAoi> GET SUCKED, PEACH
[3:37:21] <otakon17> yeah controller vs. kb+m is a bad matchup
[3:37:25] <fugly_nick> I've seen worse matches
[3:37:30] <holyxgrale> gappyvDespair
[3:37:34] <Profmcstevie> only a 2 decade old franchise, might be SOME skilled people at it

[3:37:45] <thebestesttrashpanda> ahhh the panic grenade spam
[3:37:49] <%cade_calrayn> well, if that's true, then Paige will drag down Pat's rankings and then she'll have a better time

[3:38:05] <MikeyxStyles> @otakon17 halo is made for the controller specifically
[3:38:09] <+TopTieramisu> can't escape the pat smells
[3:38:09] <+pmtriox> i can still wreck people with a mouse but its an uphill battle for sure
[3:38:13] <otakon17> don't you ahve a grappling hook?
[3:38:13] <holyxgrale> KNOCKED HIM OUT
[3:38:14] <bakkatohri> PatSmells? Is that guy streamsniping.

[3:38:49] <+pmtriox> grenade shouldn't be your first instinct
[3:38:51] <RyuuAoi> Pat, does Peach know how to camp?
[3:38:53] <%doomunderthestairs> yasssss
[3:38:53] <@SoFarFetched> Double KOs are always great

[3:38:56] <MyNameIsRasus> CROSS COUNTER
[3:39:02] <otakon17> yeah it's all about latency at that pont
[3:39:02] <RyuuAoi> Maybe she should camp
[3:39:04] <%valriot> Controller is actually really good in this tbh, its a pretty even balance
[3:39:07] <otakon17> the "AR death march"

[3:39:53] <luftraumm1> is the plasma blade what created the genji player?
[3:39:53] <+King9k> Am I the only one who can never find the grapple in these maps
[3:39:54] <%G_Thunders> Is there no radar, or is Pat on top of it?

[3:41:02] <Vermillion129> would be better cos there'll be more people carrying paige
[3:41:02] <RyuuAoi> They got multiplayer matches with ghost and shit in it?

[3:42:48] <+pmtriox> last sword ammo anyway
[3:42:48] <+cermo55> sword has battery
[3:42:50] <Zaphire_Saucypants> As Halo swords usually do.
[3:42:51] <otakon17> it's to make it balanced
[3:42:57] <+TopTieramisu> better reload the sword
[3:42:58] <otakon17> if it was infinite, it would be TOO powerful
[3:42:58] <%notsoy> so what does it amount to, 8 uses?
[3:43:00] <+DeaconBluesClues> these guys are being forced to do 3-on-1 defense to kill pat
[3:43:01] <TurtlesAndTentacles> Is this really free to play?
[3:43:02] <Profmcstevie> Runs on batteries, AAAs
[3:43:04] <otakon17> it's a one hit kill

[3:43:09] <wqorst> punch hurt his hand

[3:43:18] <Profmcstevie> Multiplayer is free to play forever
[3:43:18] <+pmtriox> the noob combo is still viable btw, plasma pistol and BR
[3:43:20] <%RayReborne> the charge pistol sucks in this it seems
[3:43:25] <MyNameIsRasus> It's a relatively close game
[3:43:26] <RyuuAoi> @turtlesandtentacles The multiplayer
[3:43:27] <CanadianAnimatorGuy> Sensitivity is WAY low wow

[3:43:35] <%SaiyanShoto> It’s not that bad, you guys are doing good
[3:43:43] <%HotSauceFiend> and can you only do the dash strike with the sword or is there another way to hit with the sword?
[3:43:43] <%scaryboisupreme> it's pretty good camo

[3:43:48] <akitanito> you have a big screen
[3:43:48] <+King9k> I dont know how people dont see them lol
[3:43:48] <+HaloIsA> Its very hard if youre tunnel visioned
[3:43:49] <fugly_nick> I think sprinting makes you visible
[3:43:49] <JetpackMcQuack> ye
[3:43:50] <+lunar_decay> better monitor i guess
[3:43:50] <%valriot> It depends on the lighting and location
[3:43:50] <%linSP> you have special eyes
[3:43:51] <zoanz> some ppl are blind
[3:43:53] <%Piemen99> They're blind
[3:43:53] <otakon17> you know what to look for
[3:43:53] <%Rumbutt> IT'S YOUR SPECIAL EYES
[3:43:55] <+ItalianWaifu> depends on how tunnel vision they get
[3:43:55] <%vaporousTippler> You don't know how many you haven't seen.
[3:43:55] <bakkatohri> You're not moving as much. People have movement based vision
[3:43:56] <nappingplant> it's very, very slight. You can sometimes see them but good luck shooting them
[3:43:57] <%JusTTheGuyYouNeed> If you are walking you become for real invisible
[3:43:57] <+wmeldrum> might be graphics settings lol
[3:43:58] <+TopTieramisu> awwww
[3:43:59] <%RayReborne> I haven't seen what it looks like on other players so idk
[3:44:02] <%doc_ock_rokc> You have a bigger screen
[3:44:02] <Profmcstevie> if it's on PC it can be one of 1000 PC settings Pat
[3:44:02] <@Ranryu692> are you running this at 4K?
[3:44:03] <%SaiyanShoto> Same for me, think it depends on the persons eyes
[3:44:03] <%Sotetsu> I have trouble seeing invisible people.
[3:44:05] <+pmtriox> all my graphics are on low so i simply can't
[3:44:05] <%twistedj3ster> I'm working with a 1050ti so idk
[3:44:05] <%notsoy> pat is a double KO specialist lmao
[3:44:05] <otakon17> you GOT'EM
[3:44:07] <%doomunderthestairs> some ppl blind plus different settings
[3:44:07] <@SoFarFetched> they hugging
[3:44:08] <+Sendrak70> @PatStaresAt Your playing against children.
[3:44:08] <%JoshManVGH> Some people lack special eyes
[3:44:10] <%studleydoorite> aren't you on like and 80" screen? that probably helps
[3:44:11] <+lunar_decay> sprinting also makes you visible
[3:44:11] <otakon17> yeah you're used to the "wave"
[3:44:12] <+King9k> Is it better if you stand still?
[3:44:12] <RyuuAoi> I mean he saw you
[3:44:13] <AsleepAura> My vision is based on big movements so i cant see it...
[3:44:13] <TurtlesAndTentacles> @RyuuAoi So I still need to buy the game then lol. Its on next gen Xbox right?
[3:44:14] <%barrakuta371> With speed lines, it makes people who are sprinting not see as well
[3:44:15] <+theomnisoup> Some people are just blind when it comes to camo in video games
[3:44:16] <BobPager> you're developing a sharingan
[3:44:17] <+polothegreatest> doodNuts I risk my chances to play ze. Halo
[3:44:21] <%Piemen99> Well you did play destiny with Invis Hunters
[3:44:28] <+ItalianWaifu> ive missed people standing still but i se everyone moving
[3:44:29] <Vermillion129> LUL
[3:44:31] <akitanito> are you sure about that?
[3:44:34] <MyNameIsRasus> No that's woman
[3:44:36] <$realm_forge> You have good vision plus the fast pace if the game can make you miss stuff
[3:44:37] <%WhereIsWill> 12 year olds don't get "predator vision"
[3:44:38] <otakon17> they would be yelling profanties if they were kids
[3:44:38] <+lunar_decay> nice nade
[3:44:38] <bakkatohri> BEAT THE CHILDREN
[3:44:38] <%king_wragles> that grenade kill was sick
[3:44:42] <@OfficioPrefectusCorgi> nice nade
[3:44:42] <%BlackMage66652> Is the kid pregnant?
[3:44:46] <+Kenzo2000> Shoved that grenade into his ear
[3:44:48] <@Ranryu692> Does the strength of Active Camo still vary depending on how quickly you're moving?
[3:44:49] <%valriot> Its a REALLY good invisibility, but you have to use it properly. I've had some people be really hard to see
[3:44:51] <luftraumm1> nice throw
[3:44:52] <+ItalianWaifu> why kids are wful
[3:44:52] <otakon17> oh no you found a guy with an obnoxious name
[3:44:53] <%Piemen99> Hell yeah that gernade was good
[3:44:53] <Profmcstevie> Children play the Fornite now, they're getting freakishly competent at the shootbangs
[3:44:54] <KeiPrime> do kids even play halo anymore or did they all grow up?
[3:44:55] <RyuuAoi> @turtlesandtentacles Yes! For the campaign! Next gen? I would think so.
[3:44:57] <otakon17> "MyGunsAreBetter"
[3:44:58] <+Sendrak70> @PatStaresAt You literally just killed a soft fluffy bunny.
[3:45:02] <+ItalianWaifu> except the one cool one evryone knows
[3:45:03] <+pmtriox> you're 100% against children, cross play cant be turned off
[3:45:05] <%FunkyStreams> Pat gets to beat up kids, thats fine
[3:45:06] <JetpackMcQuack> i'd rather beat up an adult but I take what I can get
[3:45:07] <+lunar_decay> the easiest its ever been since they just all cry more
[3:45:07] <%HotSauceFiend> Paige you clearly have not seen enough children, if you do not feel like punting one
[3:45:08] <%Sotetsu> It's Halo, they're playing against college frat guys.
[3:45:09] <%WhereIsWill> professor pat still has his ONE chat!
[3:45:10] <%FunkyStreams> but only evil ones
[3:45:12] <Quack_of_Dawn> energy sword thursday
[3:45:14] <%Piemen99> Kids are pieces of shit Peach
[3:45:15] <Vermillion129> you were like 20 points behind just now
[3:45:16] <+polothegreatest> LUL LUL
[3:45:16] <+HaloIsA> Pat im begging you to turn your FOV up
[3:45:22] <fugly_nick> Stompfests are really common
[3:45:23] <@Ranryu692> yeah, you caught up a little bit
[3:45:27] <otakon17> shame you don't get shield on kill
[3:45:30] <RyuuAoi> Fuck dem kids
[3:45:33] <+lunar_decay> this halo do be free for the first time
[3:45:34] <+King9k> Just simply lose no points ever
[3:45:36] <%RayReborne> go to C
[3:45:37] <otakon17> YOU CAN DO IT
[3:45:37] <@Ranryu692> it is *technically* possible to win this
[3:45:39] <%HotSauceFiend> @Piemen99 Kids are monsters, I would know I used to be a child
[3:45:45] <+ItalianWaifu> pull those hooker boots up by the many straps
[3:45:52] <Ghufufin> yay murder
[3:45:57] <%CatastropheCorvid> Boob-Straps
[3:45:58] <%linSP> killer paige
[3:46:00] <luftraumm1> not the hooker boots
[3:46:02] <%Piemen99> @HotSauceFiend I know right
[3:46:07] <%valriot> The Banished weapons have extra melee damage btw, so the Mangler can 1-shot 1-melee kill
[3:46:08] <akitanito> did paige get better after doing the tutorial?
[3:46:08] <$realm_forge> I don’t know what it is but I love this pvp and FUCKING HATE Destiny’s
[3:46:09] <%linSP> at least paige did better than snoop dog
[3:46:16] <+pmtriox> the mauler is fun to shoot but is vastly overshadowed by the sidekick
[3:46:19] <huskarl_zap> the ass tap
[3:46:34] <@Ranryu692> Paige just killed someone and captured a point :O
[3:46:36] <RyuuAoi> Burrito Boy is probably hung
[3:46:47] <nappingplant> thats slander, mauler demolishes people so fast
[3:46:47] <Profmcstevie> Halo is punctuated by Melee finishing
[3:46:47] <@Ranryu692> good job Paige
[3:46:49] <otakon17> abouit 4 seconds of sustained AR fire
[3:46:49] <+polothegreatest> Surprsingly, no Tbages doodBait
[3:46:56] <+lunar_decay> F
[3:46:57] <fugly_nick> That was a close match
[3:46:57] <otakon17> oh well
[3:46:58] <MyNameIsRasus> that's close
[3:46:59] <Xelhesia> NOT BAD AT ALL
[3:47:01] <+King9k> Dont think I have 1 mauler kill in 15 hrs
[3:47:03] <%RayReborne> that got really close for how most of the match was
[3:47:04] <@Ranryu692> you were down 75-150 at one point
[3:47:05] <otakon17> that wasn't that bad a loss
[3:47:09] <%WhereIsWill> not bad forreal
[3:47:10] <+pmtriox> or bot mode
[3:47:11] <RyuuAoi> Not bad at all!
[3:47:12] <Profmcstevie> Weren't sub 100
[3:47:12] <%twistedj3ster> I wish I could always have the Mangler, favorite gun
[3:47:14] <%FunkyStreams> the game could've even crashed!
[3:47:16] <+pmtriox> which still counts for xp
[3:47:21] <otakon17> yeah you wean yourself on the SP
[3:47:22] <+wmeldrum> big little victory
[3:47:22] <%Piemen99> Pat what's your sens?
[3:47:23] <%FunkyStreams> great outcome
[3:47:26] <fugly_nick> It's not uncommon to see it go 200-0
[3:47:28] <%RayReborne> btb time for CHAOS
[3:47:29] <otakon17> and THEN you play the horror of OTHER PEOPLE
[3:47:29] <MeatBomb> Halo has a single-player mode?
[3:47:29] <+pmtriox> bot mode isn't half bad
[3:47:31] <nappingplant> @King9k play around with it, it's incredibly strong on most maps
[3:47:32] <Wydamn> Cross your fingers for Quad Rockets Duos
[3:47:34] <%WhereIsWill> i love btb yeyeye
[3:47:39] <Profmcstevie> Shooting people shaped like spartans is not like shooting the FILTHY COVENANT
[3:47:46] <+セビー> bcv?
[3:47:49] <otakon17> Pat you should up your FOV so you can see more
[3:47:51] <%baka_sugoi> eww
[3:47:51] <Mattais88> I always started with the biggest deathmatches I could find, where my shitty skiulls don't really hurt the team
[3:47:53] <bakkatohri> So when do they start adding the Catgirls with huge boobas to sell cosmetics like in the league of legends?
[3:47:54] <%ItalianWaifu> ItalianWaifu subscribed with Prime. They've subscribed for 5 months! Halo
[3:48:11] <+pmtriox> you can turn bots up real high
[3:48:32] <akitanito> just one bullet?
[3:48:36] <%FunkyStreams> lol
[3:48:37] <Profmcstevie> The Halo arsenal of weapons is also kinda odd for new people
[3:48:44] <+King9k> @nappingplant Yeah its for sure me and not the gun
[3:48:47] <%ItalianWaifu> bullets go through kids easy
[3:48:48] <fugly_nick> Cory
[3:48:51] <%FunkyStreams> they sold out superhard tho
[3:48:57] <fugly_nick> Cory is the short one
[3:49:04] <Ricky_KIllman> cory for sure
[3:49:21] <RyuuAoi> GET READY FOR N BOMBS
[3:49:25] <nappingplant> the goose is loose
[3:49:42] <%SveriSageAdvice> when my team lost yesterday in ranked, some dude just started spouting slurs at us, never have i disabled a voice chat quicker

[3:50:33] <%HotSauceFiend> is cortana in this game?

[3:51:02] <fugly_nick> @HotSauceFiend I'm betting you'll be able to get Cortana as an AI for playing Campaign
[3:51:07] <+spacepiratezod> Why is that voice so HAPPY
[3:51:11] <+Kenzo2000> is Paige experiencing the classic Xbox Live Mysoginist?
[3:51:13] <%MelBrooksKA> @otakon17 It's free I believe

[3:54:54] <CurrySauseBandit> That guns actually pretty good.
[3:54:58] <RyuuAoi> Probably using a modded controller that guy.
[3:55:04] <%valriot> This weapon is actually super good, it has a DoT like Thorn when the EMP hits
[3:55:09] <otakon17> yeah that gun is for disabling vehicles
[3:55:11] <scrumbotime> Game of free dollars
[3:55:14] <+pmtriox> disruptor can wreck face if you aim well
[3:55:21] <%RayReborne> Dammit this REALLY makes me wanna play Halo now
[3:55:22] <@SoFarFetched> sometimes you just need a really good shooter to kill time.
[3:55:23] <otakon17> I just wish it had a 3rd person mode
[3:55:26] <%HotSauceFiend> but the campaign/ single player game will cost money?
[3:55:27] <%doc_ock_rokc> dead
[3:55:32] <+pmtriox> i have never killed with the stalker
[3:55:34] <@SoFarFetched> yeah campaign is seperate and will cost
[3:55:36] <%doc_ock_rokc> THOSE CHILDREN ARE KILLING YOU OLD MAN
[3:55:39] <%barrakuta371> Halo is full of killers
[3:55:42] <nappingplant> the single player will be full price yeah'
[3:55:44] <pokefan9956> @patstaresat , you plannin on playin Forza?
[3:55:52] <TurtlesAndTentacles> So the game is free? Just download on Xbox..one? Or SEXBOX
[3:55:53] <bakkatohri> There couldn't possibly be hackers in this game already, right? Like no way.
[3:55:56] <+Diamond_Dynamo> Campaign is $60, but it's on game pass, so not really
[3:55:56] <fugly_nick> TEABAG HIS ASS
[3:55:59] <Profmcstevie> Campaign will cost money but who knows, it might at least play well given the multiplayers performance
[3:56:09] <bakkatohri> @TurtlesAndTentacles or download the Steam
[3:56:21] <%valriot> You buy it and you have gamea
[3:56:22] <+TheBitingIrish> @otakon17 Only time Halo has used 3rd person is in vehicles and carrying BIG machine guns
[3:56:23] <otakon17> Game Pass is easy
[3:56:23] <nappingplant> money go in, game come out
[3:56:25] <Wydamn> Killing gives pleasure
[3:56:25] <otakon17> you pay 10 bucks
[3:56:27] <willyfreshness> it just works
[3:56:28] <holyxgrale> You get it on pc and regular xbox
[3:56:29] <Explodincatz> me neither
[3:56:29] <otakon17> you get a selection of games
[3:56:31] <%JoshManVGH> She came in with shittalking skill mastery, and she will only get stronger.
[3:56:32] <+pmtriox> you should tell paige that when vehicles glow red they explode
[3:56:32] <%AyotoCorp> You just get the xbox PC app
[3:56:32] <Daxalog> You get a bunch of games on the xbox app on pc
[3:56:34] <+Nahual_Amini> Use Xbox app
[3:56:34] <Profmcstevie> You pay money, you have access to the games
[3:56:35] <pokefan9956> you subscribe and then you can just download the games you want
[3:56:36] <+TheBitingIrish> @PatStaresAt XBOX app in Windows store
[3:56:36] <%vaporousTippler> You click a button, man.
[3:56:37] <holyxgrale> And it actually has like an xbox app on your pc
[3:56:38] <otakon17> you have to use the Windows Marketplace
[3:56:38] <%KineticZen> From the Windows Store
[3:56:38] <MemMoor> ?????
[3:56:38] <akitanito> you have windows 10 right?
[3:56:40] <+TheSaintJohn> you need the xbox app for pc
[3:56:40] <+King9k> Its in the xbox app right?
[3:56:40] <%CappuccinoGuil> you download the Game Pass app and sign up in the Game Pass website, easy
[3:56:41] <%baka_sugoi> same
[3:56:43] <otakon17> it's easy
[3:56:43] <+TheBitingIrish> o
[3:56:43] <+Diamond_Dynamo> You just use the Xbox app, which is basically just a wrapper for the Microsoft store
[3:56:44] <%RayReborne> maybe theres a launcher?
[3:56:44] <bakkatohri> Game Pass only works on Windows 10. I figured that out when I was using Windows 8.
[3:56:48] <@OfficioPrefectusCorgi> Yes
[3:56:52] <fugly_nick> Yeah there's multiple Xbox apps, it's dumb
[3:56:54] <%valriot> The Xbox app should be on your PC already
[3:56:56] <+TheBitingIrish> Companion app is the old one
[3:56:56] <%linSP> i used game pass once to get outer worlds, and now i cant delete it
[3:57:00] <CanadianAnimatorGuy> Confusing? A Microsoft account? NO
[3:57:00] <holyxgrale> Alternate reality where I downloaded the wrong one first FeelsBadMan
[3:57:02] <%barrakuta371> Oh yeah they did make that confusing
[3:57:02] <otakon17> yeah it's the Xbox App
[3:57:02] <akitanito> I thought it's just the one that came with windows
[3:57:03] <fIashman92> You just download it off the MS store?
[3:57:05] <xGeneralDOOM> u pay and u download it that's it
[3:57:06] <+pmtriox> pick up an explosive box and chuck it at a guy
[3:57:07] <%JoshManVGH> Oh there's not a launcher or something? Is it tied to Windows Store?
[3:57:08] <bakkatohri> I hate Windows store Apps
[3:57:14] <plainsongz> yeah the one called "Xbox" is the right one
[3:57:18] <+King9k> The companion app is pre-installed but the xbox app is on the MS store
[3:57:23] <TheChapyGuy> all games on Game Pass become free when you see them in the Microsoft Store
[3:57:28] <+TheBitingIrish> @linSP The game or the app?
[3:57:41] <%CappuccinoGuil> @JoshManVGH there's an Xbox app you can use on PC
[3:57:43] <fugly_nick> Infinite's campaign will be part of Game Pass
[3:57:45] <%vaporousTippler> You know Netflix? It's that.
[3:57:45] <+Diamond_Dynamo> Game pass is legit a really good deal
[3:57:49] <holyxgrale> Well they don't have it literally free, they're paying 15 a month
[3:57:50] <%linSP> @TheBitingIrish BOTH
[3:57:51] <Profmcstevie> Free if you pay for it
[3:57:55] <Zaphire_Saucypants> I love the gamepass
[3:58:03] <Explodincatz> is it a subscription?
[3:58:08] <bakkatohri> Game Pass is not Steam, it's using the Windows Store to download games.
[3:58:09] <+RiverKing13> One of the Xbox apps is a companion app for the console. There is a standalone Xbox app just called "Xbox".
[3:58:09] <+SaphronBlackbourne> Just popped in and man this cheery announced feels way out of place, never played a Halo though
[3:58:10] <SauceJockey> yeah
[3:58:13] <thelonechris> -2
[3:58:13] <@Moobot> Hey folks, just a reminder! If you have Twitch connected to Discord, you can access the PSA Sub-Discord. Go to your User Settings, go to Connections, and click 'Join' on the PSA server under the Twitch connection.
[3:58:13] <fIashman92> You go to the game's MS storepage and it'll just say download for free
[3:58:14] <%MelBrooksKA> git gud
[3:58:16] <@SoFarFetched> paige is starting to becom TOXIC
[3:58:16] <akitanito> you're creating a monster, pat
[3:58:16] <otakon17> oh no
[3:58:17] <Dr_Mooose> she's hooked now
[3:58:18] <%dreadedcthulhu> paige changing her name to kyle
[3:58:19] <otakon17> Monster is HORRIBLE
[3:58:21] <Latija> the taste of monster? like their cocks? their cum?
[3:58:22] <%Dementedpenguin> She's becoming Pat WutFace
[3:58:28] <+wmeldrum> normal monster is ASS
[3:58:32] <thicc_or_treat_> Gamepass got me Psychinauts 2 free. so that alone was a great deal
[3:58:33] <+FanServ> @SaphronBlackbourne you choose your announcer and this one is a bit of a meme
[3:58:35] <%baka_sugoi> GAMER FUAL
[3:58:36] <otakon17> it is
[3:58:37] <%HotSauceFiend> Could one describe the Taste of monster to me? I can't physically drink those
[3:58:39] <%RayReborne> Yeah i hated it too Paige but now its so good
[3:58:39] <Wydamn> Snapshot Queen
[3:58:39] <Ghufufin> just feed her Doritos and youll have a real gamer gurlfriend
[3:58:39] <otakon17> it's horroble
[3:58:41] <+AlucardX60> Why would you even drink monster if you didn't like it?
[3:58:41] <Profmcstevie> Find the flavour in something less destructive
[3:58:45] <wqorst> monster tastes horrible but drinking it feels good
[3:58:48] <otakon17> the only Monster drink I could stand is the sugar free Mosnter
[3:58:53] <TurtlesAndTentacles> Like porn
[3:58:54] <+King9k> Sort of like beer made out of sugar
[3:58:55] <+pmtriox> as opposed to 4 guys
[3:59:01] <+King9k> only
[3:59:05] <fugly_nick> I like BTB because my own performance won't hinder the team as much
[3:59:10] <@Ranryu692> Back in my day, BTB was just 8v8
[3:59:10] <%CatastropheCorvid> Piper Patty
[3:59:11] <%barrakuta371> ahoy hoy
[3:59:12] <akitanito> ahoy
[3:59:14] <kilochii> ahoy
[3:59:15] <Profmcstevie> I wonder if Paige would like CTF, just find flag man and shoot him is easy objective
[3:59:18] <RyuuAoi> Pat is Eminem. Peach is 50 Cent
[3:59:19] <%Logoth_> Look at how bad that shotgun is
[3:59:19] <%HotSauceFiend> @King9k you make Monster sound like a Cider
[3:59:20] <+athuramn> pats just wreaking havoc
[3:59:20] <Wydamn> The self-loathing helps you focus on those sweet sweet kills in game.
[3:59:20] <%KineticZen> Damn son
[3:59:20] <+wmeldrum> MURDER
[3:59:21] <Daxalog> I feel bad for anyone who would want to play a non slayer based game mode once the beta ends and you can pick whatever you want
[3:59:23] <%RayReborne> YAY POINTS
[3:59:23] <islandsunn> nice!!
[3:59:24] <%greasypete00> yeyeye
[3:59:24] <%cooldude69xx> hell yeah
[3:59:26] <otakon17> DAMN GOOD SHOTS
[3:59:26] <+DeaconBluesClues> did at just clear the entire point by himself
[3:59:27] <bakkatohri> Microsoft is kinda leading the way for affordable gaming with the Game Pass ngl.  Like they got Yakuza: Like a Dragon on there...
[3:59:32] <%FunkyStreams> well at least that was just 4 guys
[3:59:36] <+wmeldrum> BIG MAN
[3:59:43] <%Dementedpenguin> I enjoy BtB until it feels like I'm carrying the team. NotLikeThis
[3:59:45] <Xelhesia> BRINGING IT BACK
[3:59:45] <%valriot> Thats why this shotgun is good, you can just clear a whole squad with its stupid mag size
[3:59:57] <+King9k> @HotSauceFiend I guess its more like distilled gamer essence
[3:59:58] <otakon17> @bakkatohri and that game is GREAT
[4:00:01] <+RiverKing13> Game Pass is the reason the whole Yakuza series came to PC
[4:00:03] <fugly_nick> The Commando feels like it has way too much recoil
[4:00:03] <SauceJockey> is paige still bad at video game?
[4:00:05] <+Erictron4000> Is that voice Chris redfield
[4:00:10] <+wmeldrum> grapple hog
[4:00:11] <otakon17> Shotties in Halo have always been good at the proper range
[4:00:16] <+TheBitingIrish> @linSP Open App -> Click My Collection in the top left -> Click game, it'll go to the page -> Click the ... -> Click Uninstall
[4:00:23] <BenlanBen> I like big game mode, a lot less people notice how bad I play there
[4:00:33] <+wmeldrum> well done
[4:00:48] <BurdRightsActivist> @Dementedpenguin imagine thinking you'll have a good btb match in mcc until you see four people with the tag 177 on your team NotLikeThis
[4:00:49] <%SinnerEbru> awww good daddy
[4:01:05] <%Dementedpenguin> LUL

[4:01:22] <+genepark> So glad this game franchise didn’t die on the sega Dreamcast
[4:01:31] <Icekong_1001> i love turret mini gun

[4:02:03] <%valriot> Wait you can hold down the fire off that gun wtf
[4:02:05] <%RayReborne> Hey Gene!
[4:02:07] <fugly_nick> BTB in this game almost feels like Battlefield sometimes, with how large scale it is
[4:02:10] <%SuckerPunchSyd> Oh hey it’s gene
[4:02:10] <%Logoth_> Ayyyyy BOI
[4:02:14] <%SinnerEbru> hey gene!
[4:02:15] <%KineticZen> Boomer legacy media man
[4:02:15] <+genepark> Dreamcast had a lan port. Halo revolutionized online multiplayer. Duh.

[4:02:54] <%CappuccinoGuil> Gene, Pat needs help USING Game Pass, that's where we're at LUL
[4:02:54] <SauceJockey> gamepass is literally pay a sub and you can play game
[4:02:55] <+genepark> Exactly. Steve Jobs debuted halo on Dreamcast
[4:02:56] <Profmcstevie> Gene writes for video games
[4:02:58] <+kewlmyc> He specifically means Gamepass on PC
[4:02:58] <RyuuAoi> Gene Simmons?
[4:02:58] <%afronooch> @otakon17 friend of the show Gene Park from theWashington Post
[4:02:59] <bakkatohri> Game Pass should work like any other Launcher (Ubisoft, Origins, Epic).
[4:03:00] <SauceJockey> what else is there
[4:03:04] <cheap_turbo> USE THE GRAPPLE IDIOT
[4:03:04] <wqorst> forced the wasp to teabag him
[4:03:08] <%JoshManVGH> Teach how game pass in computer spot for fun games free.
[4:03:09] <%AHomeschoolDropout> if you had a grapple hook you can hijack air vehicles
[4:03:15] <+genepark> You just pay 15 bucks a month for online and game pass right? Or are you talking about halo
[4:03:15] <Profmcstevie> I did MY job
[4:03:18] <meowarco> I couldn't download Forza on GP for PC and just bought it on Steam LUL
[4:03:18] <fIashman92> You don't need an app. You literally login in to your MS account, and the GP games off the store are free
[4:03:20] <+RiverKing13> I can offer IT support for $50 an hour to help you install the Xbox app.
[4:03:25] <otakon17> you DOWNLOAD the Xbox Gaming Services App from Windows Store
[4:03:26] <%valriot> Who's Dreamcast? Ligma Jobs
[4:03:26] <%bluetocho13> Pat just download app and play games
[4:03:26] <+genepark> Or game pass on pc. I have no idea haha

[4:03:28] <BenlanBen> gamepass just works Kappa
[4:03:30] <%baka_sugoi> 1 hit
[4:03:33] <+genepark> Isn’t it its own launcher
[4:03:35] <%barrakuta371> @genepark Who the hell is Steve Jobs?!
[4:03:36] <+Diamond_Dynamo> Man, I can't wait until they let people who want to just play Slayer do that, so I can get teams who actually know how to play the objective lol
[4:03:41] <%baka_sugoi> 1 bounce actually
[4:03:42] <AsleepAura> after the first bounce yes
[4:03:49] <+genepark> You can just sign into your xbox account and it should be fine.
[4:03:52] <otakon17> it's 10 bucks a month for PC
[4:03:54] <KeiPrime> yeah thats how halo grenades have always been the timer starts after the first time it hits a surface
[4:03:57] <Daxalog> uh oh
[4:03:58] <+athuramn> ah yes, I remember when Mr jobs pulled out the halo out of his coat pocket and said you could fit in an envelope
[4:03:59] <%CalderGaming> NO PAT NO
[4:04:00] <nappingplant> it's a little awful to navigate but I just followed the link
[4:04:01] <%KineticZen> You need to install the Xbox app from the Windows Store
[4:04:02] <+FanServ> gamer pass is your pass to say a gamer word?
[4:04:02] <+wmeldrum> how do you do fellow boomer
[4:04:03] <@Ranryu692> that's Woolie's newest venture
[4:04:05] <+TheBitingIrish> ???
[4:04:05] <otakon17> it's 15 bucks a month on PC for GOLD
[4:04:07] <fIashman92> You sign in to MS account and the games off the MS store are free
[4:04:07] <GhostRavens> gamer pass? isn't that woolie's thing?
[4:04:08] <Zaphire_Saucypants> Xbox is the launcher tho...
[4:04:09] <holyxgrale> 15
[4:04:11] <CrowbarFacelift> can't say the gamer word without a pass
[4:04:13] <%SaiyanShoto> You can also shoot the grenades to make them blow up sooner, I did it on accident LUL
[4:04:14] <%baka_sugoi> EWWW
[4:04:15] <%cooldude69xx> Don't let Woolie sell you the gamerpass
[4:04:19] <+Diamond_Dynamo> I think it's $1 right now, that might've ended
[4:04:19] <+genepark> The gamer pass
[4:04:19] <%valriot> Pat, literally buy it for 1 month and never again
[4:04:21] <+King9k> Ive had teammates kill the carrier in oddball and just leave lol
[4:04:23] <%baka_sugoi> cuz BUISSNES
[4:04:24] <%CappuccinoGuil> You can get the Ultimate version for both, but yeah, doesn't seem good for you.
[4:04:27] <%HotSauceFiend> Wait why do i need a monthly pass for a steam game?
[4:04:27] <Xelhesia> is Lost Odyssey on there?
[4:04:29] <fugly_nick> Can you not get a few months of Gold and then convert it to Game Pass?
[4:04:32] <thelonechris> LUL
[4:04:33] <+FanServ> body sliding
[4:04:34] <otakon17> I mean you can get a Month plus 2 months free right now for a dollar
[4:04:35] <%AHomeschoolDropout> game pass is like
[4:04:37] <+genepark> Yeah honestly you probably own the games you want anyway
[4:04:37] <%RayReborne> tossed grenades at nobody LUL
[4:04:39] <%AHomeschoolDropout> ultra bad for backlog
[4:04:39] <%FunkyStreams> lol
[4:04:39] <+RiverKing13> $15 for Ultimate Game Pass
[4:04:41] <otakon17> and you're free to cancel anytime
[4:04:42] <%SaiyanShoto> Good point
[4:04:44] <%JoshManVGH> that face sliding
[4:04:45] <@Ranryu692> @Xelhesia Lost Odyssey is still trapped on the 360
[4:04:46] <+athuramn> you can get a pc only pass which is cheaper?
[4:04:47] <+TheBitingIrish> Did they buff the dropwall?
[4:04:54] <otakon17> you JUST NEED C
[4:04:54] <+genepark> It’s a great service. It’s also a great service I don’t use every month.
[4:04:57] <otakon17> YOU CAN DO IT
[4:05:03] <%FunkyStreams> T
[4:05:04] <+Diamond_Dynamo> Main reason to get Ultimate is to get at the cloud stuff. It's the only way to play Halo 5 on PC (but don't do that, it sucks lol)
[4:05:05] <RyuuAoi> Pat probably gets tax breaks on video games.
[4:05:06] <KeiPrime> get grenades when you respawn so why not throw em at nobody
[4:05:10] <+genepark> I usuallly just buy the games out right. Even crackdown 3, which ruled
[4:05:13] <KeiPrime> its like losing a match with meter
[4:05:13] <nappingplant> @athuramn yeah pc pass in only 10 i think
[4:05:21] <thicc_or_treat_> $15 for a month of day one exclusives is good for trying new franchises
[4:05:25] <JetpackMcQuack> that one might be theres
[4:05:25] <Xelhesia> @Ranryu692 aw that sucks. ty 4 info
[4:05:26] <+CrimsonDio11> @PatStaresAt what you do is Microsoft will put out deals every once and a while where you get game pass for $1 for a month
[4:05:29] <Profmcstevie> Don't be too excited at seeing so many men Pat
[4:05:33] <otakon17> nah
[4:05:34] <+genepark> And yeah down to play the halos
[4:05:35] <%CappuccinoGuil> Pat really jumped in like a cool action man LUL
[4:05:38] <%JoshManVGH> @ranryu692 You can play it on modern xboxs though
[4:05:39] <otakon17> I didn't notice a stutter
[4:05:40] <%SinnerEbru> gg

[4:06:18] <+genepark> Lots of assists yeah
[4:06:21] <@Ranryu692> @JoshManVGH yeah, I phrased that incorrectly lol
[4:06:22] <+athuramn> @nappingplant that's good to know! i only hear everyone usually talk about ultimate
[4:06:24] <+genepark> It happens to me a lot too LUL
[4:06:25] <%thedankestmeeme> I thikn if you 're a first timer game pass is $1 for the first 3 months
[4:06:31] <+Diamond_Dynamo> Looks like you can get 3 months for $1 if you haven't gotten it before
[4:06:35] <nappingplant> They have constant first time deals. That's the hook so you forget to ever unsub.
[4:06:39] <Profmcstevie> As long as there are people going down because of you you're helping
[4:06:48] <otakon17> like my Gamepass paid for itself with Wasteland 3, played and beat the game for like a buck
[4:06:48] <+genepark> I like that bots are so easily identifiable in this game
[4:06:51] <%RayReborne> Big smooches
[4:06:55] <fugly_nick> He's so grumpy

[4:07:57] <@Ranryu692> all you had to do was shock his empty nutsack
[4:08:04] <%FunkyStreams> just to exist
[4:08:09] <bakkatohri> I tried EA Play... The only game that is worth it is that Dark Souls Star Wars game.
[4:08:11] <Vakojin> Would he hide in a closet to eat ?
[4:08:13] <%CalderGaming> @PatStaresAt was chili something you encountered often in Quebec before Paige? genuine question
[4:08:18] <%FunkyStreams> and succumb to gravity
[4:08:18] <Xelhesia> CLAP
[4:08:18] <akitanito> but pat threatened to
[4:08:22] <otakon17> you guys have a good one I'm gonna hop out of here, it's been FUN. Sorry for insulting your headphones pat, I was wrong and am a goof. Take care folks, have a good one o/

[4:08:38] <@SoFarFetched> Skyline chili? geefThink
[4:08:40] <Vakojin> Mom's spaghetti
[4:08:41] <+Diamond_Dynamo> EA Play unironically includes a surprising amount of decent indie games
[4:08:41] <%RayReborne> with beans?
[4:08:42] <$realm_forge> Like Frankenstein
[4:08:43] <%doc_ock_rokc> Spegetthill
[4:08:44] <%JoshManVGH> Let the electricity reorb the sack!
[4:08:44] <islandsunn> in Texas it's called Frito pie

[4:09:14] <+genepark> It’s great

[4:09:23] <Mattais88> you c the f
[4:09:25] <Zaphire_Saucypants> I've sadly seen spaghetti that used chili sauce. Not a fan.
[4:09:26] <+Aheg0d> I see long time Halo fan is playing halo
[4:09:28] <+wmeldrum> puuke
[4:09:29] <mikesapartment> lmao
[4:09:31] <fugly_nick> These bots are no joke
[4:09:32] <+darudeampersandstorm> Pat’s mom making it Cincinnati style
[4:09:32] <%doc_ock_rokc> BODIES BY BOTS
[4:09:32] <huskarl_zap> bots are real ones
[4:09:32] <@Ranryu692> LUL squad deep
[4:09:33] <Dr_Mooose> damn
[4:09:33] <BitOSalt> Bots arent bad lol
[4:09:34] <akitanito> great start
[4:09:35] <Xelhesia> the whole team
[4:09:35] <%notsoy> steenkybutt lmfao
[4:09:35] <%JoshManVGH> Bot Swarm!
[4:09:36] <%CalderGaming> Paid Actors!
[4:09:39] <willyfreshness> THEY"RE A HIVEMIND
[4:09:41] <AsleepAura> Yeah they do that
[4:09:42] <bakkatohri> Speaking about subscription services like EA Play, I tried Ubisoft+ and tried Far Cry 6 and that new Vaas DLC... That game sucks - including the DLC.
[4:09:43] <Ghufufin> lol pat died in baby mode
[4:09:45] <Profmcstevie> Shoot people who have your flag, protect people who have enemy flag
[4:09:45] <+NeonLight> Bots are actually really well done
[4:09:46] <+Diamond_Dynamo> I'm actually really impressed with how good the bots are in this game, they feel like real people
[4:09:53] <MicrotonalMatt> BangBots
[4:09:54] <+genepark> The bots are pretty wild lmao
[4:09:54] <+RiverKing13> Bots mlg
[4:09:55] <%doc_ock_rokc> Pat has no awarness
[4:10:00] <+athuramn> the bot ai is also supposed to improve over time so maybe they thought it was the most viable strat
[4:10:01] <JetpackMcQuack> busy
[4:10:06] <nappingplant> Why are bots so bad solo but so good together?
[4:10:06] <+NeonLight> Looking forward to Players vs AI when more options come out
[4:10:10] <+Diamond_Dynamo> And this is like the second easiest bot difficulty lol
[4:10:16] <%DianaTheAscian> YEAH PAIGE
[4:10:18] <%JoshManVGH> YEAH!!
[4:10:19] <akitanito> paige MVP
[4:10:20] <AsleepAura> BIG GOOD JOB
[4:10:22] <Dr_Mooose> wooo go Paige!
[4:10:23] <+LazyAss24Seven> SHE DI THE THING
[4:10:25] <%JoshManVGH> sipsipDab sipsipDab sipsipDab
[4:10:26] <+LazyAss24Seven> DID
[4:10:27] <%Dementedpenguin> FBtouchdown
[4:10:28] <+wmeldrum> st ong
[4:10:28] <Ghufufin> wooo!
[4:10:31] <%maskofmichael> BIG AND STRONG
[4:10:33] <%doc_ock_rokc> Angriest pat could have killed all those bots
[4:10:34] <%FunkyStreams> there's something eal wholesome about this game
[4:10:34] <JetpackMcQuack> whap
[4:10:35] <leinadtonu> good jorb Peidge!
[4:10:39] <fugly_nick> The Mangler is so fun
[4:10:41] <%RayReborne> Steenky
[4:10:43] <RyuuAoi> Good job, Peach!
[4:10:45] <%AHomeschoolDropout> Pat understands the power of the robot armor
[4:10:45] <+genepark> Nice maybe she finished a challenge too
[4:10:49] <%JoshManVGH> sipsipDab psaDab
[4:10:50] <bakkatohri> Y'all... what if instead of bots, we used child labor and forced 5 year olds to be the bots????
[4:10:52] <AsleepAura> Paige better than Pat because she plays the obj
[4:11:11] <nappingplant> mangler straight up feels better than the ACTUAL shotgun
[4:11:12] <%doc_ock_rokc> You cant score without your flag
[4:11:14] <AsleepAura> @bakkatohri I think you're on to something
[4:11:19] <akitanito> 2 shots and bop?
[4:11:32] <%FunkyStreams> it mangles
[4:11:37] <fugly_nick> All Brute weapons have bayonets on them
[4:11:40] <+athuramn> @nappingplant it's so much more accurate than it should be LUL
[4:11:41] <%DianaTheAscian> Nice
[4:11:43] <%RayReborne> damn yeah thats aweaomw
[4:11:46] <+VestigeOuroboros> It's just a longer range Mauler from H3.
[4:11:47] <$KaosMachina> are you fighting bots
[4:11:49] <akitanito> stronk
[4:11:50] <%JoshManVGH> What a fucking gun
[4:11:55] <$KaosMachina> or 343 studios people
[4:12:05] <%FunkyStreams> its like themauler from H3, nothing really inventive about it.
[4:12:06] <RyuuAoi> Pat bout to get a care package!
[4:12:08] <+NeonLight> Bots
[4:12:09] <+genepark> All 343 players are bots
[4:12:19] <%FunkyStreams> theres tons of stuff cool about this game tho
[4:12:23] <+wmeldrum> Hansen: one-bop
[4:12:40] <+NeonLight> Shotguns feel so weird coming from D2 PvP. These ones have range, dont one shot, and dont make me feel like crap
[4:12:52] <Qsmash_> this whole time, I thought the in-game annoucner was Paige talking
[4:12:52] <AsleepAura> Woolie also likes the BR
[4:12:53] <fugly_nick> Pat you should have started a bot match and told Paige it was real
[4:12:53] <@SoFarFetched> If there's a Needler,does that mean there's a Wantler? geefThink
[4:12:54] <+Kenzo2000> Needler is eternal best girl
[4:12:57] <%CalderGaming> you did it you beat the Paid Actors
[4:12:58] <Mattais88> everyone loves the needler
[4:13:00] <%doc_ock_rokc> Look at that Blue spartan
[4:13:02] <+Diamond_Dynamo> Needler is awesome up until the second someone is shooting at me with it lol
[4:13:03] <%FunkyStreams> its like the needler from H1, nothing really inventive about it.
[4:13:04] <SpookyMooks> it's the coolest gun in halo
[4:13:04] <$realm_forge> It aims for him
[4:13:09] <%JoshManVGH> Why are all the 343 bots tagged as MARN?
[4:13:11] <bakkatohri> FORTNITE DOES THAT
[4:13:12] <willyfreshness> Dual wielding needlers was so rad
[4:13:12] <+UltraViolet371> The Needler was named after an enemy in Silent Hill Homecoming don'tchaknow
[4:13:12] <TallYoda08> atpCap atpCap atpCap
[4:13:12] <RyuuAoi> Dual needles
[4:13:17] <bakkatohri> FORTNITE DOES THE PAID ACTOR BOTS
[4:13:30] <%RayReborne> settings i guess
[4:13:34] <%Logoth_> Apex does it too
[4:13:36] <Icekong_1001> on menu said marine i believe
[4:13:38] <+Diamond_Dynamo> They're always on Marine in that mode. Only way I've seen to see the other difficulties is to boot into training mode
[4:13:38] <huskarl_zap> OUR TABLE IS BROKEN
[4:13:40] <+King9k> Ive had those things headshot me across the map before
[4:13:41] <Explodincatz> huh bots really are paid actors
[4:13:44] <@SoFarFetched> I thought that arena said CBT not CTF
[4:13:47] <+DevilFacer> dual needler was the best in the older games
[4:13:54] <Bathtub_Surfer> better than TF2 bot
[4:14:02] <%Logoth_> Whatever happened to dual wielding
[4:14:02] <@Ranryu692> you used to be able to
[4:14:06] <%Sotetsu> psaDogchamp bla bla bla bla a
[4:14:06] <Profmcstevie> Needler when used by the enemy on Legendary? Nightmare weapon
[4:14:10] <bakkatohri> The bots in every video game get paid in bytes of anime porn.
[4:14:10] <OvaltineDream> see any naked brutes
[4:14:14] <%JoshManVGH> Pile them on I hope
[4:14:15] <+TheAdMerlin> I don't know if they're ever going to add new guns
[4:14:18] <%doomunderthestairs> it would be cool if they added more guns
[4:14:20] <IntrepidEye> They'll likely add more guns like they did with 5
[4:14:22] <%FunkyStreams> its like dual needler from H2, nothing really inventive about it.
[4:14:27] <nappingplant> halo dress up is the real game
[4:14:29] <BlueSpartan119> Halo only removes weapons game to game
[4:14:33] <%doomunderthestairs> needler and those needler rifles pelase
[4:14:35] <Mattais88> buy pat a new shirt
[4:14:36] <@SoFarFetched> Paige is dying
[4:14:38] <%FunkyStreams> tons of cool stuff about this game tho
[4:14:38] <%Logoth_> eeeeehh
[4:14:40] <%RayReborne> Bowl o chili?
[4:14:40] <%AHomeschoolDropout> How the weapon pickups work is that it spawns a random weapon of that category per match, so for example a shotgun spawn might spawn a heatwave and etc
[4:14:40] <Icekong_1001> maybe rotate in playlist but forge or custom game have all weapons
[4:14:43] <BlueSpartan119> so the number should only go up from here on out
[4:14:47] <RyuuAoi> Peach be pink
[4:14:49] <%JoshManVGH> Monster go boom?
[4:14:49] <+genepark> Lol they don’t have to be man
[4:14:50] <+bigslinglelino> I doubt dual wielding will ever come back since it seemed like a balancing nightmare
[4:14:51] <islandsunn> there goes the chili
[4:14:52] <%sonuke_draws> damn it paige
[4:14:52] <%doomunderthestairs> ew
[4:14:56] <%JoshManVGH> Old coffee!?

[4:15:02] <Icekong_1001> oh no
[4:15:04] <+Fooguwu> now PAIGE SMELLS
[4:15:04] <@SoFarFetched> she didnt drop the liquid you THOUGHT it was,it was ANOTHER liquid
[4:15:05] <+Diamond_Dynamo> I assume they'll add the regular shotgun at some point
[4:15:05] <GraysonFoxworthy> LOOL
[4:15:06] <%CalderGaming> YEYEYEYEYEYE
[4:15:06] <BlueSpartan119> KEKW

[4:15:10] <%SveriSageAdvice> DISCONNECT lol
[4:15:11] <%Logoth_> That just just exploded into grenades
[4:15:11] <Profmcstevie> Oh no her disabililility
[4:15:11] <+athuramn> wtf
[4:15:12] <BlueSpartan119> he quit
[4:15:13] <fugly_nick> These Bots are hackers
[4:15:14] <Dr_Mooose> RIP LUL
[4:15:16] <churropoppa> watch the coffee leak through the floor LUL
[4:15:16] <TallYoda08> LUL LUL LUL
[4:15:17] <%SveriSageAdvice> its Splatoon all over again
[4:15:17] <akitanito> DC on stream
[4:15:18] <%Sotetsu> Whoops
[4:15:20] <RyuuAoi> That could be bad, Pat....
[4:15:20] <%barrakuta371> arcast1Shock arcast1Oof
[4:15:22] <Explodincatz> its in my racoon wounds Oh my god!
[4:15:22] <+King9k> RIP gamer heaven
[4:15:27] <MicrotonalMatt> tdogBruh
[4:15:28] <+genepark> Omg
[4:15:28] <+VestigeOuroboros> Pat smelled so bad he just couldn't take it anymore
[4:15:29] <KazairLux> lmao that looked hilarious
[4:15:30] <+DevilFacer> i really like how they made the reach characters armours the rewards for the battle pass
[4:15:34] <Ghufufin> realistic bot match where bot has a 15% chance to DC
[4:15:40] <GraysonFoxworthy> Man really got thanos snapped
[4:15:46] <%JoshManVGH> Call in MARN
[4:15:55] <bakkatohri> Bots are a great solution for enabling actual gameplay to happen... But I hate bots in Advance Wars 2 - they see THROUGH THE FOG OF WAR AND KNOW WHERE YOUR UNITS ARE ALL THE TIME.
[4:16:07] <KazairLux> I would love a Pat and Paige full Halo play through
[4:16:12] <Wydamn> Realistic bot match where the bot has a 30% chance to just grief your team
[4:16:18] <+TheAdMerlin> Weapon challenges are limited to PVP Pat, not bot matches
[4:16:19] <fugly_nick> Do challenges still track in bot matches?
[4:16:21] <BlueSpartan119> not if they're "in pvp" ones
[4:16:26] <+kewlmyc> That had to be a bot
[4:16:30] <+Diamond_Dynamo> Most of the challenges say "in PvP", so you can't get them with bots
[4:16:33] <+genepark> Yes they do
[4:16:33] <+genepark> Yep
[4:16:33] <%scaryboisupreme> hey pat on that staircase next to the train station there's an EVA 02 sticker
[4:16:35] <+Sirius_6> If the challenges say "in PVP" at the end, bot matches won't work
[4:16:41] <+bigslinglelino> god I hate the challenge system
[4:16:43] <+kewlmyc> Wait, these are all bots aren't they, just got here
[4:16:44] <+genepark> Oh yeah if they’re “in pvp”
[4:16:50] <Wydamn> Also bot has a 8% chance to be in communication with someone on the other team
[4:16:55] <%JusTTheGuyYouNeed> At least mine didn't
[4:16:55] <+IxDomxI> weapon challenges are specifically tied to pvp matches as well
[4:17:02] <+genepark> But the match challenge still counts at least
[4:17:15] <+Diamond_Dynamo> Ok, custom games also let you set bot difficulty
[4:17:18] <bakkatohri> Gamer words
[4:17:23] <Qsmash_> gamer words monkaS
[4:17:32] <%Sotetsu> Were they drinking mountain dew?
[4:17:33] <nappingplant> I have only had one Halo game so far with a guy saying LOTS of gamer words
[4:17:35] <+Kenzo2000> They were probably not talking to the woman then.
[4:17:41] <DSD24> Gamer TM words?
[4:17:42] <%RayReborne> Oh no the MOUNTIES
[4:17:47] <Profmcstevie> Oh no Paige wielding a weapon called SPANKR is very on brand
[4:17:51] <NeedlesD> Kinda want to see Pat and Paige go through Halo campaigns now.
[4:17:52] <%InternetShis> InternetShis subscribed with Prime. They've subscribed for 5 months, currently on a 4 month streak! Hey look it's an Infinite amount of Halos! What shall we play today? Oddball or Oddball?
[4:17:52] <%RayReborne> Space Mounties
[4:18:15] <DSD24> @InternetShis You will get 1 slayer each session
[4:18:16] <fugly_nick> The Sentinel Beam feels kinda weak in this game
[4:18:21] <+TopTieramisu> close match
[4:18:23] <akitanito> 200 vs 0
[4:18:27] <Visorak6> Take us out???
[4:18:27] <+Diamond_Dynamo> I am sad they didn't bring the Halo 4 lightrifle back. It's easily my favorite weapon 343 introduced

[4:20:20] <%FunkyStreams> Zangiefs balls
[4:20:25] <Dr_Mooose> ok ok
[4:20:26] <%KineticZen> I misinterpreted that as "chilly secrets", as in "how do you stay so COLD"
[4:20:26] <BlueSpartan119> ( Mark V [B] )

[4:29:22] <pokefan9956> Paige should play through all the halo games

[4:29:53] <BlueSpartan119> rest are in MCC
[4:29:54] <%A_Zealous_Retort> all but 5 I saw someone say
[4:29:54] <%doomunderthestairs> master chief collection has em
[4:29:55] <%CappuccinoGuil> With the MC collection
[4:29:55] <willyfreshness> Yup
[4:29:55] <+King9k> Everything up to 4 yep
[4:29:55] <Dr_Mooose> yeye
[4:29:56] <Major_Lee_> All but 5 but 5 sucks
[4:29:56] <Profmcstevie> MCC makes it all really smooth
[4:29:56] <+TheSaintJohn> yes they're on pc except 5
[4:29:58] <CanadianAnimatorGuy> 5 is the worst
[4:29:59] <%A_Zealous_Retort> OH ITS REALLY BAD
[4:29:59] <+Diamond_Dynamo> It sure is lol
[4:29:59] <Xelhesia> yup
[4:30:00] <+Forshino> MCC Playthrough? Nice
[4:30:00] <+deadeyemax> 5 sucks ass
[4:30:00] <%AncelDeLambert> 5 is not good
[4:30:02] <%Archphronimos> everything but 5
[4:30:02] <BlueSpartan119> the DMC 2 of halo
[4:30:03] <fugly_nick> It's pretty not great
[4:30:04] <Profmcstevie> everything but 5 is in masterchief collection
[4:30:04] <%Archphronimos> IT IS
[4:30:05] <@Ranryu692> it was the 2nd game they ever made LUL
[4:30:05] <%AncelDeLambert> 5 is pain on the eyes
[4:30:06] <%InternetShis> Yeah
[4:30:06] <%doomunderthestairs> and they plus odst and reach
[4:30:07] <+TheSaintJohn> 5 is okay, but the story is bad
[4:30:09] <+Diamond_Dynamo> I played it via Game Pass cloud
[4:30:10] <Neo_Kaiser> Ew 4 and 5 are terrible.
[4:30:11] <%A_Zealous_Retort> dont play 5, just forget it exists
[4:30:12] <$realm_forge> You can skip 5
[4:30:12] <Profmcstevie> and Masterchief collection is like 15 bucks on sale
[4:30:13] <+Forshino> It really is
[4:30:14] <marvel877> Yes, but not 5. No one wants 5
[4:30:14] <%CalderGaming> i never played 5 multiplayer why was THAT bad?
[4:30:15] <Daxalog> I want to play 5 so bad. Just to see
[4:30:18] <BitOSalt> id say 4 is worse but that feels like a personal thing
[4:30:19] <+Ynkubus_> 5 is poop but still should be part of the mcc on pc
[4:30:19] <+Nahual_Amini> Fuck Halo 5 campaign
[4:30:21] <phantalime> 5 plays good but story is a joke
[4:30:22] <%SinnerEbru> was 5 the cortana shit?
[4:30:23] <+barristerofthebar> This is a great way to pretend it didn't happen
[4:30:24] <%Dementedpenguin> Halo 5 convinced me not to get the Xbox One.
[4:30:25] <%scaryboisupreme> bad story, bad gameplay, bad multiplayer
[4:30:25] <%A_Zealous_Retort> they would decanonize it if they werent cowards
[4:30:26] <+deadeyemax> Bad story and totally different story
[4:30:26] <fugly_nick> Halo 5's multiplayer is pretty fun, but the campaign sucks
[4:30:26] <+Basker17> 5 was so bad they made Infinite an Isekai for Master Chief
[4:30:27] <+dog_the_guy> They actually admitted they didn't think anyone wanted it on PC
[4:30:28] <+Diamond_Dynamo> 5 plays ok, but the story sucksss
[4:30:29] <atgithursdays> local man asks questions he should know the answer ro
[4:30:31] <+Kenzo2000> 1234 reach
[4:30:31] <CanadianAnimatorGuy> The gameplay was focused on esports
[4:30:32] <+TopTieramisu> "evil"
[4:30:33] <%Aleate> That really says something, because I couldn't even make it through 4, so if 5 is worse... woof
[4:30:33] <+genepark> 5 was terrible
[4:30:33] <+TheSaintJohn> they actually didn't use that plot, which is the problem
[4:30:35] <+TheAdMerlin> They actively want to pretend 5 didn't exist. Pat, did you see the Pre 5 guide? You had to read and watch like, 8 things to get ready for it
[4:30:38] <+deadeyemax> Multiplayer was all esportsy in 5 too
[4:30:45] <fugly_nick> It also completely undoes Halo 4's ending
[4:30:45] <BitOSalt> That was the marketing, not the actual thing
[4:30:46] <%CappuccinoGuil> Master Chief goes ROGUE
[4:30:47] <$realm_forge> 5 is the watery bean soup chili of the halo franchise
[4:30:47] <%Valdorick> Master Chief wanted that Cortana AIussy
[4:30:48] <%AncelDeLambert> 5 was just orange on orange on neon
[4:30:49] <Neo_Kaiser> Plat 1, 2, 3, ODST and Reach.
[4:30:49] <Major_Lee_> Meownir lol
[4:30:51] <BlueSpartan119> what if DMC4 was DMC2/DmC quality?
[4:30:54] <BlueSpartan119> is Halo 5
[4:30:59] <$slawson619> Halo 5's multiplayer is good and was supported for several years
[4:31:00] <Profmcstevie> STOMPED
[4:31:02] <+VestigeOuroboros> 5 doesn't even play good, and it had framerate issues that led to shit textures.
[4:31:02] <+Diamond_Dynamo> Not even, it's like immediately "oh, actually Master Chief is right", even though he's kinda wrong lol
[4:31:09] <marvel877> 4 and 5 REALLY wanted you to have had read all the books beforehand.
[4:31:13] <%RAGING_1NF3RNO> They made Cortana the villain in 5
[4:31:13] <+King9k> Does Chief every actually wear the big stupid poncho in that game
[4:31:16] <%FunkyStreams> MASTER CHIEF WOOPS DANTES ASS BAN ME
[4:31:16] <%greasypete00> difficult 2 kil
[4:31:16] <scrumbotime> Paige's natural cowardice helped
[4:31:16] <%A_Zealous_Retort> 4 is pretty OK, acts as a good epilogue to 1-3
[4:31:18] <ramzyrizzles> da BADMON
[4:31:20] <%RayReborne> BIG BALLS
[4:31:21] <Profmcstevie> Paige you are revealed when you have the ball
[4:31:21] <%Valdorick> PAIGE WON THE ROUND!
[4:31:24] <fugly_nick> @King9k Never
[4:31:28] <Mattais88> Did paige just call the ball the sexy man?
[4:31:31] <nappingplant> I like the big stupid poncho
[4:31:32] <+genepark> 4’s story was good for sure.
[4:31:39] <+deadeyemax> OVER YONDER
[4:31:40] <+Basker17> @Mattais88 yea
[4:31:43] <+Diamond_Dynamo> The only thing I like about 5 is getting to go to the Elite homeworld and stuff
[4:31:44] <BettyMwwaahh> im sad the grapple isnt default
[4:31:44] <%notsoy> of course she did, it's a skull
[4:31:44] <+genepark> I didn’t like the Promethean weapons
[4:31:54] <%tanarath> 4 is solid, 5 is diarrhea
[4:31:58] <nappingplant> cloth on armor is the best design choice, sorry I dont make the rules
[4:32:03] <%Sotetsu> Good... or cheap?
[4:32:03] <willyfreshness> The delay mustve done wonders
[4:32:04] <holyxgrale> What's your gpu?
[4:32:05] <@DakotaMacDoodle> same
[4:32:06] <fugly_nick> It's a huge upgrade from the reveal showcase
[4:32:08] <RushUnplugged> wrong opinion alert: capes and shit over armor look DOPE and you're crazy if you don't agree
[4:32:10] <%RetroCop87> Did this game murder the new CoD release?
[4:32:17] <marvel877> those prometheans felt like not-Metroid Prime enemies
[4:32:18] <%JoshManVGH> It's a LOT of fun!
[4:32:19] <BlueSpartan119> 10 year game
[4:32:21] <%FunkyStreams> okay Pat is team AMD I guess?
[4:32:23] <BlueSpartan119> SmileW
[4:32:27] <Neo_Kaiser> Vanguard murdered the new CoD release.
[4:32:28] <digimonda> CoD mudered the new CoD release
[4:32:31] <+Diamond_Dynamo> The actual level wasn't good, but the idea of going to Sanghelios is cool
[4:32:34] <%A_Zealous_Retort> DONT YOU WANNA REP YOUR FAVORITE EEEEESPORTS TEAM
[4:32:36] <%Valdorick> "Master Chief is my lifestyle"
[4:32:39] <Melchior_the_Wise> and sell the campaign separate
[4:32:39] <BitOSalt> nothing wrong with cosmetics, only the price lol
[4:32:39] <%AHomeschoolDropout> Halo 1 & 2 have two player co-op, while everything after 3 is 4 player
[4:32:40] <+deadeyemax> GET DUNKED ON NERD
[4:32:41] <krin_x> yo how many moms has paige f*ked already
[4:32:41] <bakkatohri> Can you believe people pay like $50.00 for skins in League of Legends?
[4:32:45] <%barrakuta371> People have already spent up to $135 to Max out the battle pass early
[4:32:47] <Ghufufin> cant be noob without no skin
[4:32:50] <dizimous> Oh God ya
[4:32:52] <+genepark> I am one of those dipshits pat
[4:32:53] <%greasypete00> also no pats in battlefield
[4:32:54] <Profmcstevie> Halo is hitting it this year, everyone else isn;t
[4:32:56] <%InternetShis> 4 is a solid, okay game overall with a 7.5/10 story and a dead multiplayer, but 5 is just made by people who don't know what Halo is
[4:32:59] <dizimous> It's just Halo only now holy shit
[4:33:00] <%JoshManVGH> Nah great year... for Halo
[4:33:01] <%SaiyanShoto> I want a cosmetic skin, some of them look cool
[4:33:01] <pokefan9956> are these bots
[4:33:01] <+UltraViolet371> but destiny's doing great right Kappa
[4:33:02] <%HotSauceFiend> I mean I just play CSGo whenever i need an FPS
[4:33:02] <%Valdorick> Do you kids want a CLASSIC fps!?
[4:33:05] <+VestigeOuroboros> Vanguard is in contention to be the worst cod game since infinite warfare.
[4:33:05] <digimonda> the donnie darko crossover in cod warfare or whatever the last iteration was is better than all of vanguard
[4:33:07] <+TheAdMerlin> The new Battlefield is EXPLICITLY no-pat so
[4:33:08] <@Ranryu692> this is definitely Halo's chance to reclaim the throne
[4:33:08] <+genepark> Battlefield is also terrible lol
[4:33:10] <@DakotaMacDoodle> All coming up Halohouse!
[4:33:11] <%RayReborne> Free shooter thats Great and doesnt suck? who'd say no to that?
[4:33:12] <fugly_nick> Halo kinda picked the perfect year to not only come back, but actually be good again
[4:33:12] <Neo_Kaiser> I want Titanfall 3!
[4:33:13] <$slawson619> Why we playing against bots?
[4:33:14] <TurtlesAndTentacles> Pat has no right to call anyone a dip shit for buying cosmetic because of his Waframe and Genshin Fever of the past
[4:33:15] <Profmcstevie> HALO WON FPS KING OF THE HILL THIS YEAR
[4:33:15] <@SoFarFetched> ThrillHo
[4:33:16] <JeoDood> HALO COMING IN
[4:33:16] <+Basker17> I just wanna get my CQB Helmet
[4:33:18] <+genepark> Xbox was like RELEASE HALO NOW
[4:33:19] <$realm_forge> Also destiny has begun its descent like Pixar
[4:33:19] <%AHomeschoolDropout> Vanguard was so bad that FUCKING KOTAKU wrote an article criticizing how woke it is
[4:33:20] <marvel877> Play this or go back to playing Team Fortress 2.
[4:33:21] <%scaryboisupreme> I want the classic halo shotgun back
[4:33:22] <+Diamond_Dynamo> If only there was a new Titanfall to fill the void
[4:33:23] <BlueSpartan119> O SHIT YOURE FIGHTING THE CAT-EAR SPARTAN
[4:33:23] <chaos2frozen> F2P is the future :)
[4:33:23] <%slimmixrp> Same
[4:33:23] <Mattais88> Warzone's free if you have 500gb free on a harddrive
[4:33:23] <%velemi> the bulldog sucks
[4:33:29] <%slimmixrp> Halo 1 goated
[4:33:29] <%barrakuta371> I also don't like the bulldog
[4:33:33] <Daxalog> Halo 1 shotgun sounds hot
[4:33:34] <+TheAdMerlin> The bulldog is full Auto pat
[4:33:34] <+deadeyemax> Have you tried the mangler? It's a BEAST of a weapon
[4:33:35] <BlueSpartan119> 343 Meowlnir
[4:33:35] <%Valdorick> Halo 1 shotty was fucking amazing
[4:33:35] <%RayReborne> but Mangler is great
[4:33:36] <%bravebravesrobin> I'm actually enjoying Vanguard, but I'm a sucker for WW 2
[4:33:37] <bakkatohri> @HotSauceFiend I like CS:GO for selling crates and adding money to my Steam wallet.
[4:33:38] <%FunkyStreams> Halo seems pretty god tho
[4:33:39] <RyuuAoi> Pat, play some La Bouche while you play.
[4:33:40] <Neo_Kaiser> Vanguards campaign ends with sequel bait.
[4:33:41] <%InternetShis> The Bulldog needs better stopping power at 5 meters
[4:33:42] <%RayReborne> looks great anyway
[4:33:47] <marvel877> They don't have the old Shotgun in this?
[4:33:48] <Profmcstevie> Hilariously Halo infinites delay may have not only helped the games quality but timed it PERFECTLY
[4:33:51] <%xXRealGamerThaigeXx> the bulldog is good, not as good as the pump shotty but its not a power weapon
[4:33:52] <Melchior_the_Wise> bull dog is the mauler clone?
[4:33:57] <$realm_forge> The halo 1 shotgun was broken as fuck
[4:33:57] <%tanarath> Halo 1 shotgun & automatic pistol were great
[4:34:08] <%scaryboisupreme> I miss when the skull was an instant kill melee
[4:34:16] <%InternetShis> Halo 1 shotgun was ridonkulous
[4:34:17] <+VestigeOuroboros> Pats aim is better than it was a couple days ago.
[4:34:19] <Profmcstevie> Halo 1 guns are a wild west dude, that pistol is cheating LUL
[4:34:23] <%HotSauceFiend> @bakkatohri crates are like 5 cents a piece lol
[4:34:35] <%A_Zealous_Retort> could introduce old shotty in addition to bulldog as a power weapon version, maybe make bulldog weaker but much faster firing as an autoshotty
[4:34:37] <+genepark> Bulldog feels like a little baby shotgun
[4:34:38] <fugly_nick> Look at those cat ears
[4:34:42] <%Aleate> Do you think it hurts to have your thumb in the skulls fire eye-socket
[4:34:47] <%InternetShis> God I want those cat ears
[4:34:52] <bakkatohri> @HotSauceFiend Have you seen what some of the crates go for on the marketplace :U
[4:34:58] <marvel877> Say you could own if the pistol had a scope, that shit got balanced so you best learn to cope.
[4:35:00] <%FunkyStreams> lol
[4:35:00] <+Diamond_Dynamo> I think Halo 4 lightrifle was my favorite weapon in the series, conceptually. BR when you don't aim, DMR when you do? That shit's cool
[4:35:04] <Profmcstevie> Bots to warm up your FPS muscles
[4:35:05] <Xelhesia> meow just got eviscerated
[4:35:06] <+Sirius_6> @scaryboisupreme Devs said it has a faster melee animation than the normal punch as slight compensation
[4:35:15] <%Valdorick> Stuck
[4:35:16] <Profmcstevie> You are allowed to drop the ball Paige
[4:35:21] <+barristerofthebar> great plays
[4:35:24] <Profmcstevie> The skull can sit on the floor for 5 seconds
[4:35:35] <Xelhesia> LUL
[4:35:35] <%JoshManVGH> Victorious!
[4:35:40] <%InternetShis> Smart
[4:35:41] <%xXRealGamerThaigeXx> the ball whispers to her
[4:35:44] <+King9k> Ball is the only weapon you need
[4:35:48] <%KineticZen> Ball separation anxiety
[4:35:48] <%JoshManVGH> Skull am friend!
[4:35:51] <%Valdorick> ABC - Always Be sCoring
[4:35:52] <RyuuAoi> Good job, Peach! Good job, Pat!
[4:35:57] <%InternetShis> That makes her better than 70% of Oddball players
[4:36:02] <bakkatohri> @xXRealGamerThaigeXx Lowenstein... Lowenstein....
[4:36:08] <+deadeyemax> If you get the Mangler, it's a one-shot-melee kill
[4:36:10] <+MisterDiesel> You gotta hold onto your balls
[4:36:10] <+King9k> Sit in a corner and ponder your orb
[4:36:12] <%Puhff> BALL IS LIFE psaDab
[4:36:19] <RyuuAoi> She won't drop the hall but she will drop the coffee!
[4:36:23] <$realm_forge> Paige must always have the papyrus head
[4:36:25] <%FunkyStreams> aaaand he got wifu
[4:36:35] <+Diamond_Dynamo> There's a lot of medals that I get and I don't even know what causes them. I should probably check that sometime
[4:36:35] <CurrySauseBandit> It's got a nice shooting ttk as well.
[4:36:40] <Profmcstevie> We're making Paige Quickplay ready
[4:36:42] <+cubbywolf> HE'S ALWAYS LOVED PASTA RATING I mean HALO
[4:36:44] <RyuuAoi> @patstaresat help her change her colors
[4:36:53] <@Ranryu692> Halo should be fought in mid-air
[4:36:53] <pokefan9956> LUL
[4:37:05] <fugly_nick> It's kinda a confusing menu tbh
[4:37:08] <BlueSpartan119> also the fact mangler is a 3 shot anywhere threw me through a loop
[4:37:09] <+deadeyemax> Needler finally got the love it deserved
[4:37:13] <+cubbywolf> Paige going mlg

[4:37:39] <+cubbywolf> like a true hater
[4:37:43] <%maskofmichael> Just imagine the other team is all women Paige
[4:37:45] <%xXRealGamerThaigeXx> but then it will be even more true cus stinky corpse
[4:37:46] <ChinMusicTwo> the knuckle crack sound on the mechanical arm LUL
[4:37:49] <Profmcstevie> PatSmellz is eternal, even in death
[4:37:50] <%WackyGear> @PatStaresAt what do you think about the maps?
[4:37:52] <akitanito> perfect
[4:37:54] <+cubbywolf> hehe blew herself off
[4:37:56] <%Bluwizard21> a dead pat would smell
[4:37:59] <@SoFarFetched> "I blew myself off" -paige geefSmugAF
[4:37:59] <%FunkyStreams> wdym?
[4:38:06] <Profmcstevie> Join the club of killing yourself in Halo
[4:38:07] <%Dementedpenguin> I've played Halo games in forever and I still do it.
[4:38:11] <%Dementedpenguin> It's fine LUL
[4:38:11] <RyuuAoi> We can put the controller in the toilet sad you can still play, Pat.
[4:38:15] <+Diamond_Dynamo> I just wish there were more maps tbh
[4:38:19] <fugly_nick> The Skewer rules
[4:38:19] <%InternetShis> 343 343 Zero?
[4:38:24] <%barrakuta371> SKEWER arcast1Shock
[4:38:24] <Profmcstevie> If you've never fucked up a sticky throw and exploded yourself, you aren't playing Halo
[4:38:29] <%HotSauceFiend> a question, can you disable the commentators wierd interjections
[4:38:31] <RushUnplugged> can the game be modded so that all enemies have boobs, then Paige will go 10-0
[4:38:39] <CurrySauseBandit> So I didn't know the disrupter had AoE on it on the EMP. It's neat.
[4:38:42] <nappingplant> has anyone tried the repulsor equipment because it is just Dark Souls 1 Wrath of God
[4:38:46] <+athuramn> br is just such a good default gun
[4:38:48] <%xXRealGamerThaigeXx> is paige playing with controller or kb&m
[4:38:49] <@Ranryu692> brute rocket launcher?
[4:38:58] <OvaltineDream> Oh like the raytheon knife missle
[4:39:03] <%FunkyStreams> not a bad inclusion
[4:39:07] <%A_Zealous_Retort> it will kill pretty much any VEHICLE
[4:39:08] <@Ranryu692> just give them mouth to mouth to heal that
[4:39:09] <%InternetShis> It's the new Splazer
[4:39:14] <fugly_nick> It's a sniper rifle where you don't need to get a headshot
[4:39:15] <bakkatohri> Y'know how there are bands that do music for the video games sometimes? You can always tell if a Video game is bad if Korn is doing a track for a video game.
[4:39:18] <%FunkyStreams> kinda like cancer
[4:39:18] <bakkatohri> Haze, Silent Hill.
[4:39:22] <%Valdorick> Man, it would have been embarrassing if you died to a bot before firing your skewer.
[4:39:34] <%FunkyStreams> BUT IF YOU MISS
[4:39:35] <RyuuAoi> @xxrealgamerthaigexx She can't find the Xbox Elite controller pat gave her.
[4:39:39] <%InternetShis> It's the new Spartan Laser, playing the anti-vehicle gun
[4:39:39] <%FunkyStreams> you die
[4:39:42] <akitanito> no scope?
[4:39:43] <@Ranryu692> are they mad because you let them get dirty?
[4:39:44] <+cubbywolf> it penetraits like no other rocket could
[4:39:49] <Profmcstevie> OOF, that guy is very ded
[4:39:55] <+TheAdMerlin> The Skewer is such a perfect replacement for the Laser, it's so much better balanced and more fun
[4:39:56] <%Bluwizard21> is it the same guy doing the kill commentary?
[4:40:03] <%Bluwizard21> cause that guy is hilarious
[4:40:06] <%InternetShis> Yup

[4:41:37] <%xXRealGamerThaigeXx> there is friendly fire in ranked
[4:41:44] <%Bluwizard21> dont the actual team designate themselves with 343?
[4:41:45] <%SveriSageAdvice> i've betrayed one too many teammates who walked in front of me
[4:41:48] <+pmtriox> people are very much stupid and can't be trusted to do basic things
[4:41:48] <RyuuAoi> Damn that Austin Powers trilogy is actually super strong!
[4:41:51] <%Valdorick> A lot more assholes playing FPS's than when it was 2004
[4:41:54] <+deadeyemax> FEAR THE PINK MIST
[4:41:56] <%Bluwizard21> i mean i know these are bots
[4:42:03] <Profmcstevie> 343 names are bots, we're playing bots to let Paige warm up her FPSin
[4:42:15] <%Aleate> When the bots get the needler is really scary sometimes
[4:42:27] <%RayReborne> bruh its been nothing but bot battles for like 40 minutes LUL
[4:42:46] <%FallenAngelZelos> FallenAngelZelos subscribed at Tier 1. They've subscribed for 19 months! Hi Pat
[4:42:46] <%RayReborne> 343 is playing with Pat and Paige Kappa
[4:42:54] <%RayReborne> i know
[4:42:54] <%A_Zealous_Retort> electric weapons do less damage overall I heard but do weird stuff like have DoTs
[4:43:06] <%orochiblood> we wanna see you get the l33t kills on people tho
[4:43:06] <%Puhff> speaking of which, where are all the Covenant weapons????
[4:43:18] <%Puhff> All I've seen is Needler and Plasma Pistol
[4:43:19] <+deadeyemax> that shock rifle is pretty good though
[4:43:20] <%FunkyStreams> its a soundwave
[4:43:26] <bakkatohri> What's wrong with bots? Are you bigoted against bots? Bots can't play games now?
[4:43:27] <Profmcstevie> Radars a motion tracker
[4:43:28] <fugly_nick> It's a motion sensor. Crouching makes you not appear on it
[4:43:31] <digimonda> this game has no radar, it just has a man baked into that corner
[4:43:31] <%Bluwizard21> owned
[4:43:34] <%Valdorick> YEEEEEAH!
[4:43:37] <bakkatohri> Bots unironically are good.

[4:43:48] <%DianaTheAscian> Godfather is a cool bot name
[4:43:50] <%FunkyStreams> for reasons unknown
[4:43:54] <RyuuAoi> Bots on COD Ghost were my shit
[4:44:00] <%RayReborne> Bots are for Kids Kappa
[4:44:09] <%Valdorick> That bot was trying to skewer you.
[4:44:10] <Profmcstevie> Bots on Red Faction 2 gave me over 50 hours easy as a kid
[4:44:10] <+FrenchTact1cs> Clem?
[4:44:17] <fugly_nick> That was not the  biggest shoot
[4:44:18] <+deadeyemax> Why are you slaughtering these Digital-Americans like animals?
[4:44:20] <%RayReborne> like the Cereal that tastes like ass fruit
[4:44:25] <bakkatohri> @orochiblood Bots are the only way I ever experienced MP for some games >:U which is more than people have done
[4:44:25] <%xXRealGamerThaigeXx> question pat, Is there bot difficulty or is it just the same across the board
[4:44:41] <RyuuAoi> Bots helped me get good tbh
[4:44:42] <%afronooch> y bulli godfather :(
[4:44:47] <Profmcstevie> There's bot difficulty, might just be limited to the training mode though
[4:44:48] <Latija> no scope
[4:44:49] <RushUnplugged> Pat dies- VICTORY
[4:44:51] <%DedlokPM> @deadeyemax because they ARE animals. teenSTARE
[4:44:51] <+DazzlingFuhrer> It sounds delicious.
[4:44:52] <AMDBR9S> u steaked them
[4:44:52] <%Valdorick> it means you're on a kill streak
[4:44:53] <+deadeyemax> It eans you kicked their ass real good
[4:44:53] <BlueSpartan119> you kicked their ass super hard
[4:44:54] <fugly_nick> I was just about to ask that
[4:44:54] <+pmtriox> 5 in a row
[4:44:54] <%InternetShis> They should add momentum to the Skewer hitbox so you can pin bodies
[4:44:55] <%CalderGaming> stake-tacular?
[4:44:55] <MarsKarl> WICTORY
[4:44:56] <%PatNTheHat> You staked em good
[4:44:57] <%RayReborne> Using the stake grenades?
[4:44:57] <GemeSvev> You won by a large margin
[4:44:57] <%slimmixrp> Beat them super hard
[4:44:57] <Cyropike> It means you won by a big difference
[4:44:58] <BlueSpartan119> a blowout match
[4:44:59] <nappingplant> it means you blew the other teams ass out
[4:44:59] <%Broand> Stakes?
[4:45:00] <OlavOlavsson> Won by a big margin
