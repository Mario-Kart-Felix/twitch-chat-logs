[0:14:29] <Tracazoid> Yeah masks and beard make for a combo, particularly if your nose starts to run at all and you have snot shoved between your beard and mask
[0:14:35] <%Bloomingzonda> You could have made Star Burns
[0:14:35] <%NovaKnightmare> Should've just become a Bubble Person
[0:14:37] <%MidnightBurst12> fair
[0:14:37] <+Havictos> yeah but now we have to look at it
[0:14:40] <%shruke> best to be safe
[0:14:41] <+twohitgood> military level mask security
[0:14:42] <+TehWorstGamer> I use a gaiter with my beard
[0:14:43] <ToneBacas> N95 mask?
[0:14:47] <marvel877> My cousin's 2 year old has Covid. The entire household has been exposed. I had a wicked fever last night. How's everyone else doing?
[0:14:47] <%PocketBearIllustrator> a beard for a shot. a worthy sacrifice psaBig psaSun
[0:14:48] <%willyfreshness> put the mask on, shave around it
[0:14:49] <%JoshManVGH> Nope, I used to fit test N95s, any facial hair is an immediate fail.
[0:14:53] <+twohitgood> military allows moustaches, btw. moustaches work with masks.
[0:14:54] <Camo_boy67> You either call full trim and no trim.

[0:15:02] <%0dokuro> part of why the military cares about it, gas masks and all that dont have a good seal if you got scruff.

[0:22:38] <%StephanieSadGirl> The ONLY reason I'd say not to play Disco, is that it makes other Crpgs look worse in comparison
[0:22:41] <CanadianAnimatorGuy> Don't fuck a boot

[0:25:57] <%Agami23> it looks like a mobile game ad that isnt real and the real game is just a shitty gacha
[0:25:59] <Profmcstevie> I think you mean it looks like an evolution of Pc games from the late 90s
[0:26:03] <%hewlettfan96> There should be a list of fake games in other media
[0:26:08] <Profmcstevie> like if AoE 1 never changed artstyle just polish

[0:26:52] <%StephanieSadGirl> YAY FUCK BOBBY KOTIK
[0:26:53] <@ssjklyco> Does that mean they technically don't get their union?

[0:31:56] <MarcoMook> Been watching you for close to a decade and only recently started poking into Twitch.
[0:31:57] <@goose_attack_almanac> That Tifa story gets an extra layer to it in that a newspaper printed Tifa getting railed as their front page image.
[0:31:59] <%doomunderthestairs> soon the transformation to egg pat will be complete
[0:32:00] <ScreamLord> @Profmcstevie Basically you're a blue collar space worker in billions of dollars of debt to evil space corporation #394652 and you have to work it off by taking apart old, decommissioned space ships
[0:32:00] <%captain_thickthighs> @notsoy true, The remade took away all of Aeriths cake
[0:32:02] <%cartakus> Cloud is best girl though
[0:32:09] <%cade_calrayn> to be fair, it usually *is* Paige yelling
[0:32:11] <$chance_h> Omg nice
[0:32:11] <marvel877> fart cushion
[0:32:17] <CanadianAnimatorGuy> Dark Souls 1 the best
[0:32:20] <DancesWitBalrog> Bloodborne wdym
[0:32:25] <%cartakus> Part 2 sucks
[0:32:27] <%Mathochism> psaDabb
[0:32:32] <%TheREALGirthMan> Woolie's inability to tell left from right ruined Bloodborne for Pat
[0:32:33] <BliVru> PRE LORDVESSEL dark souls you mean
[0:32:37] <+twohitgood> really? bloodborne so low.
[0:32:38] <CanadianAnimatorGuy> Surprised BB that low
[0:32:39] <%hewlettfan96> Dark souls 3 is the best?
[0:32:39] <Treasure_Vault> Dark Souls 1 has the best overall world structure, so it's really, really hard to beat.
[0:32:42] <%NovaKnightmare> good list
[0:32:44] <DianaTheAscian> Idk why everyone counts Sekiro
[0:32:47] <HitchhikingThrough> thems some takes
[0:32:57] <%notsoy> is the only consensus on that list DS2 being the worst?
[0:32:58] <$chance_h> Dark souls 1 is the dark souls of dark soul games
[0:33:01] <%Agami23> grinding for vials
[0:33:02] <PizzicatoFive5> Snailsborne
[0:33:02] <%Dakuu75> agreed
[0:33:04] <%tusk102> BLOODGEMS
[0:33:07] <%hewlettfan96> Actually no Bloodborne is the best and one of the best game ever!!
[0:33:07] <%AgniBrandt> Chalice dungeons suck
[0:33:08] <Profmcstevie> Bloodborne with a good performance might be higher for me
[0:33:08] <%Tearonex> Blood Vile stuff not great
[0:33:09] <%shurtal> BLOOD VIALS
[0:33:11] <%JustToWatch> Pat you were always crazy
[0:33:11] <DancesWitBalrog> Lovecraft Souls #1
[0:33:14] <%AncelDeLambert> and the gems suck
[0:33:15] <%StephanieSadGirl> Bloodborne FUCKED UP by having vials need to be farmable
[0:33:17] <Treasure_Vault> Could use a PC release for cheat engine
[0:33:18] <%tusk102> arent skill weapons just worse than strength
[0:33:21] <CanadianAnimatorGuy> ! FRENZY !
[0:33:22] <%Agami23> items in the store increasing in price constantly
[0:33:23] <%Aeoneth> Estus was a perfect mechanic and anything not estus is a downgrade
[0:33:24] <sirtommygunn> the shock of seeing you without your beard hit me hard, like I physically reeled back like I'd been smacked
[0:33:25] <Brandon__Brando> the healing is the worst
[0:33:27] <+twohitgood> meh, i just use cummdungeon for echoes to buy vials.
[0:33:30] <%AncelDeLambert> it really needs a pc port so we can mod out all of that shit
[0:33:32] <%Dakuu75> I got into the habit of using my level-up left-overs on vials everytime so I never run out
[0:33:33] <+trackles_64> thats basicallly every fromsoft game
[0:33:40] <%cartakus> If you're good enough you don't need much vials but dungeon sucks ASS
[0:33:42] <%NovaKnightmare> kinda'
[0:33:42] <%hewlettfan96> Bloodborne is nearly perfect and Dark souls 2 needs more love
[0:33:45] <%crimsonharvest> a butcher, yes

[0:37:17] <KnivesEve> s
[0:37:25] <$abcismasta> Cheer500 Speaking of Sekiro, what did you think of Jedi: Fallen Order? I thought the difficulty settings were an excellent implementation.
[0:37:28] <DianaTheAscian> I wonder whats gonna happen with WoW now that Microsoft owns it
[0:37:32] <T_Sasquatch> Bepis
[0:37:32] <@Ranryu692> I had gamepass for 3 months, cancelled it, and recently had to buy Bloodstained so I could replay it because it isn't even on gamepass anymore. fuck gamepass
[0:37:35] <Profmcstevie> Congratulations, now your Xbox is your 2nd steam library....of unplayed games
[0:37:54] <%RealThiele> WoW will likely be like candy crush theyll just coast along on the exsisting returns
[0:38:19] <@Spydurman> give me Diablo 2 Resurrected on Steam and I'll be happy
[0:38:42] <%0dokuro> Give me more runewords in Diablo 2 Resurrected and I'll be happy
[0:38:45] <@Ranryu692> I wish xbox would just sell a video card I could put into my PC to let me play OG and 360 games
[0:38:45] <T_Sasquatch> Fallen order is a bizarre game. It feels like someone designed it in a different decade , its very .. Nostalgic i guess in its progression and level design
[0:38:53] <%RealThiele> wait for some mod group to take the D2R models and give me a free version
[0:38:55] <ExpressNode> My steam library isn't that huge but I still haven't finished many of the games on there for as long as I had it
[0:39:17] <%PocketBearIllustrator> I'll be honest, even after Microsoft buying them, I still don't feel comfortable buying from Activision Blizzard.
[0:39:27] <Profmcstevie> Post up your steam games count, I got 271 sugoiDansu
[0:39:46] <%cartakus> jesus
[0:39:51] <%ShinobiPhoenix> @Ranryu692 You're mad that a game you played for free wasn't still there waiting for you when you left and came back?
[0:39:53] <+Havictos> @abcismasta I myself liked it except for the usual problem of the lightsaber feeling like just a glowing baseball bat. I get for balance reasons you can't just one shot things like back in the old jedi academy days
[0:39:54] <ExpressNode> So does Bobby Kotic still have a job or is he replaced by Microsoft now?
[0:39:54] <%RealThiele> Blizzard is mostly a shell anyways. they relied on reputation and bombast and thats mostly gone now
[0:40:08] <DianaTheAscian> Bobby is gone
[0:40:13] <%RealThiele> Bobby will have a job until the transition is done, then parachute away
[0:40:16] <%chance_h> chance_h subscribed with Prime. They've subscribed for 10 months, currently on a 1 month streak! Just got a job offer for $13\hr for heavy machine operator. I told them to shove it because Walmart pays $14
[0:40:18] <SaltkeyAndAckfish> i just joined, has the stream been like this for 40 mins?
[0:40:22] <@Spydurman> Bobby will be gone post-transistion
[0:40:24] <DianaTheAscian> and he prob got a big bag of money to leave as well
[0:40:25] <%TheREALGirthMan> Any love I had for Blizzard died with the WC3 remaster debacle
[0:40:39] <+SodiumPatrol> based
[0:40:39] <@Spydurman> @SaltkeyAndAckfish naw he finished donations and is taking the dog out to pee
[0:40:40] <%0dokuro> ActiBlizz is a shell cause most of the good people left a long time ago.
[0:40:40] <$abcismasta> @t_sasquatch I was playing Sekiro, and I straight up just dropped it when I played fallen order, it feels like a good mix between from soft and the jedi knight games

[0:42:12] <+EmotionalFatGuy> I enjoyed this game but it does get somewhat repetitive
[0:42:12] <%moon_king> psaDab psaDab
[0:42:12] <+capybruhArt> this title screen looks machine generated
[0:42:12] <%ChrisPlaysThing> sounds like it's coming through the wrong source originally, i heard little whispers
[0:42:13] <@ssjklyco> Wow that's a mobile / 2000s PC box screenshot
[0:42:13] <@Ranryu692> correct

[0:42:16] <+AmanisHouseOfNonsense> That lady's face is very difficult.
[0:42:17] <%AncelDeLambert> RAID! SHADOWLEGENDS!

[0:42:21] <%tusk102> @PatStaresAt it looks like those ads that just lie
[0:42:22] <Tracazoid> A mobile game porn ad
[0:42:22] <%crimsonharvest> it loks like a 1999 box art
[0:42:22] <%0dokuro> It looks like its trying to sell me an NFT

[0:42:23] <+Mrbaconator> IT DOES
[0:42:23] <sampsonhero> froobPeek

[0:42:26] <HitchhikingThrough> This radiates fake energy
[0:42:27] <%CatastropheCorvid> XBOX Live indie game
[0:42:27] <+ReallyBigRocks> yeah a bit
[0:42:27] <MyNameIsRasus> CLICK NOW!!!
[0:42:28] <Treasure_Vault> this is an ad for a videogame
[0:42:28] <LunarRemix> Kind of like early Warframe ads.
[0:42:28] <+froduck42> thats how mafia works
[0:42:28] <maguado87> I want Pat to talk about Microsoft maybe someday making the other Super Smash brothers
[0:42:29] <%Idziman> like a sitcom game
[0:42:29] <NateyBeak> its an old graphics card box art
[0:42:30] <%TheREALGirthMan> This looks like a mobile game from like 2005 somehow
[0:42:30] <dashwallkick> placeholder
[0:42:31] <+Kyma1020> THAT'S A FACEBOOK AD GAME
[0:42:33] <%JustToWatch> it looks like a twitter ad game
[0:42:33] <%ChrisPlaysThing> Discount BumbleBee
[0:42:33] <%JoshManVGH> The presentation is... rough
[0:42:34] <@ssjklyco> The image is sooooo flat
[0:42:35] <r0termond> Titanfall at home
[0:42:39] <MyNameIsRasus> Rift Shadow Legends
[0:42:43] <AncyentMarinere> Just missing the titty jiggle physics CoolCat
[0:42:44] <T_Sasquatch> It looks like bad skidrowgames pc art
[0:42:44] <%strakillias> It looks like a real, bad video game except for the part where it actually rules
[0:42:47] <%blastyoboots> And the music sounds like it was made in Garageband
[0:42:47] <+AmanisHouseOfNonsense> God, I miss Xbox Live Arcade
[0:42:49] <marvel877> This looks like one of those ads on a website along the lines of "you'll cum in minutes" or something like that.
[0:42:51] <jayunderscorez> Am I the only one getting heavy Spy Kids vibes from that title screen?
[0:42:53] <%0dokuro> that bug is dead
[0:42:54] <%TheREALGirthMan> Oh man she broke that rift
[0:42:55] <chimeraxmachina> This looks like an arca album cover … giving Hyperpop
[0:42:58] <$Futurecity10> of this is just avatar
[0:42:58] <%ShinobiPhoenix> I usually don't get mad about reading something on Kotaku especially since I talk to a lot of the reporters personally now, but I am mad at the one who said this game was Diablo with Minecraft
[0:42:59] <%captain_thickthighs> that's some cell phone game add art
[0:43:01] <%Sotetsu> Where was this made?
[0:43:01] <+trackles_64> Cool mech
[0:43:03] <+Havictos> @patstaresat click now and see titties we swear
[0:43:03] <%ChrisPlaysThing> what the tribes?
[0:43:03] <+tempestzephyr> it looks like jank from another country
[0:43:05] <%RealThiele> beetlebreaker
[0:43:08] <ape_hawk> is this a card game?
[0:43:12] <%tusk102> @jayunderscorez spykids 3 with the big robot juni pilots
[0:43:14] <%CatastropheCorvid> It gets worse
[0:43:15] <HitchhikingThrough> Is this China?
[0:43:15] <Hyphen_Sum> Into The Breach 2 looking fire
[0:43:17] <%twistedj3ster> E3 is really early this year
[0:43:18] <%ShinobiPhoenix> I was not prepared for STARCRAFT when I loaded it up on my Xbox
[0:43:18] <Fenlig> She looks like Graphics card Box art! @PatStaresAt
[0:43:18] <%crimsonharvest> its just knack right
[0:43:19] <HitchhikingThrough> because this feels like china
[0:43:20] <dashwallkick> semi fake, but the art is too good for actual fake
[0:43:20] <maguado87> so is this a porn game?
[0:43:22] <%Mendin> oh no you're losing cubes
[0:43:23] <@Spydurman> prepare for the MATCH 3 GAME LUL
[0:43:24] <marvel877> Oh, wait, I remember seeing the ad for this. Yeah, that game's super fake.
[0:43:24] <%Sotetsu> Oh no
[0:43:25] <%brisk_dacat> Look it CT
[0:43:26] <r0termond> Looks cool so far
[0:43:27] <+capybruhArt> this is going to be an indie aesthetic when Unreal Engine 5 drops mark my words
[0:43:28] <%XelanArdel> its like they mastered the uncanny valley
[0:43:28] <MyNameIsRasus> That does not obey the laws of thermodynamics
[0:43:30] <%0dokuro> Is this where they try to sell me a crypto currency?
[0:43:32] <%chance_h> Great art style imo
[0:43:34] <%RealThiele> base cubes
[0:43:35] <$Futurecity10> even the voice acting sucks
[0:43:36] <%rumtumtugnutz> This looks like a porn game
[0:43:36] <+Kyma1020> THAT SOUNDED SO STIFF
[0:43:38] <+Fefe41> Pat is such a bigshot he runs mobile game ads on his stream now
[0:43:46] <%ShinobiPhoenix> it will END YOU if you don't follow the tutorial
[0:43:47] <r0termond> Oh wow
[0:43:50] <%JoshManVGH> And that's the story!
[0:43:52] <+Jaromero435> I'm ready to pave this alien planet
[0:43:53] <HitchhikingThrough> yeah no kidding
[0:43:55] <MyNameIsRasus> Minecraft digivolves into MineCrypto
[0:43:58] <@Ranryu692> I'm amazed this game doesn't have Denuvo
[0:43:59] <%ChrisPlaysThing> what even is this
[0:43:59] <%Treuan> Oh it's sup com
[0:43:59] <%CatastropheCorvid> AAAAnd this is what it looks like.

[0:44:02] <%TheREALGirthMan> How many doge did you get to play this game be honest
[0:44:06] <%tusk102> @PatStaresAt glad to see you are sponsored by raid shadow legends now
[0:44:08] <%ShinobiPhoenix> he's Diablo RTS in every sense
[0:44:08] <%StephanieSadGirl> I did NOT expect it to be topdown
[0:44:12] <LunarRemix> Can you make the UI a little bigger?
[0:44:13] <%RealThiele> build your base to mine ETH

[0:44:15] <%0dokuro> hi
[0:44:16] <%captain_thickthighs> This is not going to be another one of those indie games where it's secretly about depression right
[0:44:16] <+transporterthesequel> Ohh no this is the good game that is hilariously bad at everything but the actual game.
[0:44:17] <%ChrisPlaysThing> I fucking HATE, Denuvo

[0:45:33] <%TheREALGirthMan> Pat you should do the booby streamer thing and make your camera huge and gameplay tiny
[0:45:34] <%whatsittoya> psaDabb
[0:45:35] <ExpressNode> Oh nvm this works too
[0:45:37] <+ThomasOfTroy> I feel physical pain
[0:45:37] <@Ranryu692> you look like you're part of the UI now
[0:45:37] <dd44dostivei> pat it's 2014 and its cringe to video yourself playing video games
[0:45:38] <%0dokuro> I was waiting to you to go dead center.
[0:45:38] <%StephanieSadGirl> Pat, just make it a really small box, so its just the fleshegg part
[0:45:40] <+ReallyBigRocks> make your facecam drift around the screen like the DVD screensaver
[0:45:40] <r0termond> hello
[0:45:43] <@Ranryu692> it adds to the fakeness of the game
[0:45:51] <ToneBacas> wiggle the stick side to side real quick
[0:45:51] <DianaTheAscian> LUL LUL LUL
[0:45:52] <%CatastropheCorvid> Hey Man. Left Handed robot.

[0:46:02] <SaltkeyAndAckfish> jesus
[0:46:04] <r0termond> lol
[0:46:05] <%0dokuro> It looks cool
[0:46:09] <HitchhikingThrough> huh. Parts of this look really bad
[0:46:10] <%StephanieSadGirl> @ReallyBigRocks That'd legit be baller
[0:46:12] <+Havictos> @marvel877 speaking of antivirus one time when I was younger I had Norton find a virus with Norton in the name which made me laugh because I started to think norton itself a virus?
[0:46:13] <%tusk102> @PatStaresAt is this an rts
[0:46:15] <+coolthulhuu> game is fun despite the aesthetic
[0:46:17] <%captain_thickthighs> so it's fake on purpose or ad fake game
[0:46:18] <%blastyoboots> You can choose which hand I thought
[0:46:22] <+trackles_64> its also on gamepass
[0:46:23] <%ShinobiPhoenix> the game plays fine, but it's an RTS and if you aren't prepared for that, you will die
[0:46:23] <HitchhikingThrough> but that movement seems really responsive
[0:46:24] <General_Terro> i feel like ive played this on scarcraft 2
[0:46:28] <%0dokuro> Like if Diablo played Factorio
[0:46:30] <%TheREALGirthMan> Dungeon crawler?
[0:46:31] <%AncelDeLambert> no
[0:46:33] <ape_hawk> its a diablo
[0:46:34] <+Jaromero435> Tower defense / action rpg / automation
[0:46:35] <%CatastropheCorvid> It is many things
[0:46:35] <r0termond> @trackles_64 really?
[0:46:36] <%ShinobiPhoenix> it's Diablo RTS
[0:46:38] <BliVru> @patstaresat would you call it the best game of 2021?
[0:46:39] <%linSP> real? Real fake?
[0:46:39] <%RealThiele> eurojank at its finest
[0:46:41] <%AncelDeLambert> it's a Tower Defense
[0:46:42] <%Arkfyre> It's like factorio, with less supply line managment, and more combat
[0:46:46] <%StephanieSadGirl> Important question, can you befriend those dinosaurs?
[0:46:46] <%JustToWatch> huh
[0:46:47] <SaltkeyAndAckfish> is this a colonialism simulator?
[0:46:48] <+Jaromero435> and factorio
[0:46:48] <Profmcstevie> It's got the heart of a video game covered in clown makeup, I love this game
[0:46:48] <godila2> its star hawk from ps3, but diablo style
[0:46:50] <%tusk102> weird
[0:46:51] <MyNameIsRasus> So it's League of Legends?
[0:46:51] <+trackles_64> manua l mining ewwww
[0:46:52] <%JoshManVGH> It's like that other basebuilding game you played that one time
[0:47:02] <%Shubreaker> YOU MUST CONSTRUCT
[0:47:02] <%Bluwizard21> you must construct additional pylons
[0:47:04] <%tusk102> fucking carbonium
[0:47:07] <+trackles_64> Fuck u nature
[0:47:11] <%ShinobiPhoenix> it's on GamePass, so I played it on my Xbox and I was expecting Minecraft after a Kotaku article, but it's STARCRAFT
[0:47:18] <%RealThiele> bonium Kreygasm
[0:47:18] <%chance_h> Lol monkey balloons
[0:47:20] <%tusk102> JUST LIKE THE SIMULATIONS
[0:47:29] <%captain_thickthighs> @patstaresat if you like this I would suggest playing the Ascent It's an indie Diablo light game that is very good cyberpunk themes like it's gorgeous
[0:47:31] <ExpressNode> Blow up the base
[0:47:37] <SaltyAzteca> Hubbardium Kappa
[0:47:39] <%ShinobiPhoenix> at some point, it gives you 5 minutes or it sends a LITERAL ZERG RUSH at you
[0:47:39] <+ReallyBigRocks> it's garbage
[0:47:44] <%AncelDeLambert> the VA is very not good
[0:47:49] <%RealThiele> Gallon tea 37

[0:47:58] <dd44dostivei> the word carbonium makes my ears ring
[0:48:01] <+TopTieramisu> carbonara factory
[0:48:01] <%blastyoboots> Mindustry is one of the closest games to this I know, maybe
[0:48:02] <DianaTheAscian> so whens the mafia gonna show up in this?
[0:48:02] <Profmcstevie> Them Polish got some interesting English VAs
[0:48:07] <%strakillias> YOUR FACTORY IS UNDER ATTACK
[0:48:10] <%AncelDeLambert> LUL they're eating his drill
[0:48:13] <MyNameIsRasus> PAVE IT TO THE GROUND
[0:48:16] <%JustToWatch> this game is the wrong budget. It should be more, or less, not this weird middle
[0:48:18] <SaltyAzteca> somethin somethin ADDITIONAL PYLONS
[0:48:18] <ape_hawk> thats right, genocide the wildlife!
[0:48:19] <%ShinobiPhoenix> I woudln't use your good weapons on weak enemies until you can make new ammo
[0:48:22] <MyNameIsRasus> DESTROY ALL WILDLIFE
[0:48:24] <%AncelDeLambert> You Must Construct Additional Pylons
[0:48:25] <%SharkMissile> Oh no I'm late
[0:48:25] <HitchhikingThrough> oh that's some good blood
[0:48:29] <azure_dunes> PAVE THIS SHIT
[0:48:31] <+Havictos> God that looked clean
[0:48:33] <%SharkMissile> Is this a tower D style game?
[0:48:35] <r0termond> lol
[0:48:40] <%StephanieSadGirl> @SharkMissile Welcome to the fleshegg and jank stream
[0:48:42] <DianaTheAscian> Wind is free
[0:48:43] <MyNameIsRasus> Nuclear power tho
[0:48:44] <%tusk102> i agree
[0:48:45] <ape_hawk> because farts?
[0:48:45] <+trackles_64> Fart power?
[0:48:47] <HitchhikingThrough> so does the planet
[0:48:47] <%king_wragles> I'm a radioactive fan myself
[0:48:47] <+darethsbane> so is this just factorio?
[0:48:48] <p_e_a_x> nah wiind power isass
[0:48:49] <@Ranryu692> Paige has mentioned
[0:48:50] <%RealThiele> yea big factorio energy mixed with a diablo
[0:48:52] <ExpressNode> You're no too late
[0:48:53] <%0dokuro> "You must construct additional Pylons."
[0:48:53] <%NopeBadguy> what's your favorite type of power
[0:48:54] <%notsoy> coal- i mean, carbonium factory
[0:48:55] <%tusk102> wish we had wind power more irl
[0:48:57] <+ReallyBigRocks> why is it so squishy?
[0:48:58] <%Arkfyre> It's like factorio, with less supply line managment, and more combat
[0:49:06] <Profmcstevie> Factorio but you must KILL
[0:49:06] <%SharkMissile> @StephanieSadGirl Oh god it's so shiny it hurts to look at
[0:49:07] <Rionxgarland> this game does look fake
[0:49:08] <%AncelDeLambert> but with less of what makes Factorio good
[0:49:17] <r0termond> Has Pat played Subnautica?
[0:49:22] <%strakillias> Factorio + Starcraft 2 custom games = The Riftbreaker
[0:49:25] <%king_wragles> Nuclear, holy shit my brain forgot an entire word
[0:49:26] <+tempestzephyr> Cause pat supplies it since he's a windbag
[0:49:28] <Rionxgarland> so @PatStaresAt what kinda game is this ive never herd of it
[0:49:30] <MyNameIsRasus> So we back in the mine
[0:49:32] <+ReallyBigRocks> all the sound effects are wet
[0:49:33] <%ErikFeral> "Are ya breaking the rift, son?"
[0:49:37] <%0dokuro> More pylons
[0:49:39] <%JoshManVGH> Did they ever fix the electrical grid bug?
[0:49:45] <%linSP> this is dota 7
[0:49:45] <frankavich> I'm guessing it
[0:49:47] <%ShinobiPhoenix> 5 minutes
[0:49:55] <%greasypete00> why do they always use vertical turbines in these games
[0:49:56] <%blastyoboots> Definitely not Factorio, more like Atomicrops
[0:49:58] <+trackles_64> build a wall
[0:50:00] <%StephanieSadGirl> Pats minein' that Bonium alright!
[0:50:01] <%tusk102> @Rionxgarland diablo/tower defense/rts

[0:50:15] <%BlueLunecy> What's this guys damage
[0:50:18] <@Spydurman> did she screw up saying Sentinels?
[0:50:20] <frankavich> I'm guessing it's supposed to sound like Starcraft.
[0:50:23] <%SharkMissile> @ShinobiPhoenix kekekek :Y
[0:50:25] <%0dokuro> God that voice acting psaSkelmo
[0:50:26] <%JoshManVGH> NEED CARBS

[0:50:36] <%ShinobiPhoenix> I got zerg rushed and turned the game off because I was just like EXCUSE ME!
[0:50:37] <%notsoy> based on the icons, it sounds like you also need more power
[0:50:41] <%RealThiele> scv good to go sir
[0:50:44] <%StephanieSadGirl> This game would be better if you played as Crabs
[0:50:48] <ape_hawk> the mining sounds like my parents having sex

[1:04:42] <%RealThiele> those real technical energy connector
[1:04:46] <$caliginouscalico> @PatStaresAt power in this game uses a multiplier to slow things down if you go over, so having only a bit under is fine short term.
[1:04:46] <%JoshManVGH> Nice rock formations for defense
[1:05:08] <%Reaped_Psyche> Shaven Pat is always such a strange and other worldly experience.
[1:05:13] <%cartakus> Why need human pilot? Why can't be robot?
[1:05:13] <MyNameIsRasus> why so many meteors? is sephiroth on this planet?
[1:05:16] <+TheBitingIrish> Oh no, Pat shaved
[1:05:23] <%JustToWatch> oh I just realized that this game is on gamepass
[1:05:24] <%luftraumm1> iirc Z is he hotkey for power extenders
[1:05:26] <%TheREALGirthMan> Pat shaved HARD
[1:05:26] <%AncelDeLambert> and now put in electricity

[1:07:40] <%luftraumm1> @caliginouscalico it works for this  tutorial, but the rest of the game is gonna be a bit rough
[1:07:41] <%AncelDeLambert> WOW the VA is even worse than I remember
[1:07:44] <%JoshManVGH> do the sentry towers have 360 degree targeting?
[1:07:58] <%maenos2> zerg rush kekeke

[1:08:33] <%whyskeywolfe> More like carbonerium ore
[1:08:37] <%AncelDeLambert> this isn't factorio, there's no belts
[1:08:37] <%caliginouscalico> @JoshManVGH Yes, but there's also some kind of collision on projectiles I dont fully understand. it might be just the player or other towers too
[1:08:49] <+ChaosedStar> Turn them into soup
[1:08:59] <%0dokuro> pew pew pew
[1:09:02] <+Kikaliq> why pat head look so small
[1:09:07] <%whyskeywolfe> Oh so this is just factorio?
[1:09:07] <MyNameIsRasus> you automate the carnage
[1:09:19] <%cartakus> overkill
[1:09:21] <ExpressNode> Murder now commencing
[1:09:22] <%AncelDeLambert> can't you shoot through the walls? Thought you could
[1:09:24] <enreimirai> btw, repairing is extremely powerful. You can just sit there repairing your stuff and it is bordering invincible if you do
[1:09:37] <%caliginouscalico> @whyskeywolfe factorio, but more exploration, less staring at conveyers for 20 minutes
[1:09:37] <%AncelDeLambert> Pat, build a platform to stand on behind your wall
[1:09:44] <%luftraumm1> i wonder if pats gonna notice that gates let you get out and keeps enemies out
[1:09:45] <valstriam> It really does remind me of mobile game ads
[1:09:47] <%TheREALGirthMan> THIS rain is harmless
[1:09:51] <enreimirai> Certain weapons can, others cant. Platforms let all weapons shoot over walls
[1:09:58] <+olive_js> What genre of game is this?
[1:09:59] <MyNameIsRasus> harmless rain... the robots make you wonder why it came
[1:09:59] <%caliginouscalico> @AncelDeLambert you need to be standing on an elevated platform, it's a weird system
[1:09:59] <%0dokuro> psaBlind
[1:10:04] <cpt_langosta> does it let you have big spider?
[1:10:17] <%barrakuta371> psaBlind
[1:10:22] <%JoshManVGH> @patstaresat There are defensive structures you can build that are little steps for Mr. Rigs. Lets you shoot over your walls.
[1:10:23] <%AncelDeLambert> does this game Wild Wild West?
[1:10:34] <%caliginouscalico> @olive_js half factory sim, half twin stick
[1:11:04] <%StephanieSadGirl> Zergussy central!
[1:11:05] <%TheREALGirthMan> "Let's look inside to see if it's occupied" while mowing down a bunch of zergs
[1:11:17] <+olive_js> @caliginouscalico Thanks. Tower defence elements?
[1:11:33] <arkv01> build more pylons
[1:11:39] <%AncelDeLambert> this really is more just a Tower Defense mode of Starcraft
[1:11:42] <+TheBitingIrish> Is this Mech Factorio?
[1:11:44] <BliVru> @patstaresat Did you find the 2 secret bosses in the prologue?
[1:11:44] <%TheREALGirthMan> A D D I T I O N A L
[1:11:46] <enreimirai> I recommend grenades and hammers. Hammers break the big bois, and grenades let you hit groups without having to worry as much about aim cause it arcs over stuff
[1:11:47] <%TheREALGirthMan> P Y L O N S
[1:11:50] <cpt_langosta> ew floor anus
[1:11:51] <%caliginouscalico> @olive_js yeah, but most factory sims have those
[1:12:08] <+olive_js> @caliginouscalico Oh I see! I didn't know that.
[1:12:09] <+TheBitingIrish> @cpt_langosta At least it isn't a ceiling anus
[1:12:09] <%0dokuro> I like the part where the fleshy hive go boom
[1:13:03] <%AncelDeLambert> yeah, you can just build a wall across the chokepoint
[1:13:11] <cpt_langosta> LUL
[1:13:14] <%JoshManVGH> Wrekt
[1:13:16] <MyNameIsRasus> good job greg

[1:13:25] <%maenos2> good job pat
[1:13:28] <azure_dunes> nice one gregory
[1:13:32] <Treasure_Vault> Are there a million keybind shortcuts that the controller miss out on?
[1:13:39] <%JoshManVGH> Mmm delicious batteries
[1:13:39] <SuperChumps> @PatStaresAt My plan tonight was having a friend over who has never played Bloodborne to play it while I get high and try to explain the lore- but that got canceled so I'm here.
[1:13:42] <cpt_langosta> oh wow, twitch does an emote preview now how quaint
[1:13:43] <%luftraumm1> good jorb greg
[1:13:49] <senfood> Anyone else getting those really good dopamine hits from the construction sounds in this game?

[1:13:56] <MyNameIsRasus> how much apm does high level riftbreaker require
[1:14:07] <+AWKWARDL0SER> Did you know there’s a Popeye game that was released last month? It looks RUFf
[1:14:11] <%caliginouscalico> @Treasure_Vault less than youd think, but a decent amount
[1:14:17] <%JoshManVGH> @senfood it's SUPER addicting
[1:14:23] <rempai1> D:
[1:14:30] <%caliginouscalico> you can actualy custom keybind every structure in the game
[1:14:36] <enreimirai> Depends on if you prefer running out to fight stuff or sitting back and letting base defences handle problems.
[1:14:36] <+capybruhArt> giefin'

[1:16:01] <Laecerelius> you're gonna need more carbonium
[1:16:01] <TheStrongBanana> gonna need more carbonium I think
[1:16:02] <+Gamblitz> Silos Needed
[1:16:04] <%JoshManVGH> It's carbonara is cheese sauce, pasta, and prechuto, or bacon
[1:16:06] <Rionxgarland> not enough carbonium.
[1:16:11] <+coolthulhuu> but the carbonium...
[1:16:11] <%MidnightBurst12> until the sun burns out
[1:16:14] <Fenlig> Those power grids are not connected
[1:16:14] <senfood> I think you might be out of carbonium.
[1:16:16] <valstriam> additional carbonium
[1:16:17] <%whyskeywolfe> Zhuge Liang ... the wind!
[1:16:19] <$abcismasta> don't you need to connect them?
[1:16:20] <enreimirai> Autosave
[1:16:22] <MyNameIsRasus> monkaS
[1:16:24] <%Reaped_Psyche> Never enough Carbonara
[1:16:25] <robosqueeb> why not just stockpile carbonium
[1:16:27] <%luftraumm1> you got those biomatter generators that give a bit more oomph
[1:16:30] <%AncelDeLambert> well, you've been at this for a while, so
[1:16:32] <Lizardsphere> just wondering, do we have enough carbonium?
[1:16:33] <%caliginouscalico> @PatStaresAt relax, it's interval autosave

[1:17:09] <$abcismasta> @PatStaresAt don't you need to connect the two grids?
[1:17:09] <%JoshManVGH> Has he landed on the planet or is this still tutorial?
[1:17:13] <+Jakeofalco> is this still the tutorial ?
[1:17:14] <%whyskeywolfe> Only for generating biomass
[1:17:23] <senfood> Gotta love games where you spend the majority of your time telling nature to suck it.
[1:17:32] <%caliginouscalico> you get functionally infinite plants very quickly
[1:17:38] <%luftraumm1> naaaa it gets useful later too, just gotta get those farms
[1:17:47] <%caliginouscalico> @JoshManVGH tutorial
[1:18:18] <cpt_langosta> NotLikeThis gregg...
[1:18:19] <IIVELIISCHPFULII> it was fortunate those were spaced exactly perfectly
[1:18:22] <%JoshManVGH> Glad base building is fun in this hame then
[1:18:34] <+PrimalDweeb> Got to get them carbs man!
[1:18:38] <%whyskeywolfe> And you need more bonerium.
[1:18:39] <senfood> You? Low on carbonium? Noooooo.
[1:18:55] <+Gamblitz> Ur Tiberium fields are depleted bro.
[1:19:01] <%caliginouscalico> @senfood your chacracter sometimes goes, "no nature is cool though" while talking about a tyrranid ecosystem, while the mech tells you to burn anything in your way
[1:19:26] <$realm_forge> Carbonium was what that one guy who fell in love with his car did
[1:19:32] <%caliginouscalico> I razed the 50 meters in every direction around me just on principle
[1:19:45] <%TheREALGirthMan> @realm_forge ( ͡° ͜ʖ ͡°)

[1:20:07] <+Jaromero435> aliens LOVE carbonium
[1:20:08] <%Bluwizard21> you require more vespene gas
[1:20:18] <%AncelDeLambert> bet you could find some choke points and set up gunwalls on them
[1:20:18] <+mustachegolem> I need MORE power
[1:20:23] <%SharkMissile> @realm_forge Was that guy also a dragon?
[1:20:24] <$abcismasta> you have a ton of power between all your grids, but you gotta connect them @PatStaresAt
[1:20:28] <%Reaped_Psyche> Gotta bone those carbos
[1:20:29] <%TheREALGirthMan> Honk if you would rather be gathering carbonium
[1:20:34] <%luftraumm1> link your main base pat, enemies generally ignore the extenders
[1:20:44] <azure_dunes> "we should genocide those indigenous species SUPER HARD"
[1:20:55] <IminyourBase> don't connect your grids, just make the outpost self sufficient
[1:21:04] <Rionxgarland> not enough carbonium.
[1:21:08] <$abcismasta> oh thank god
[1:21:08] <%AncelDeLambert> ... still there
[1:21:13] <%AncelDeLambert> LUL
[1:21:19] <@Ranryu692> you didnt stop them
[1:21:27] <%AncelDeLambert> oh no he panic'n
[1:21:34] <MyNameIsRasus> did the energy just jump from 1.3k to 92k??
[1:21:39] <%SharkMissile> With sharp claws and lil' pointy teefs :B
[1:21:43] <%caliginouscalico> @PatStaresAt you get the breach message when a fence is destroyed, regardless of if it makes a hole
[1:21:45] <%AncelDeLambert> rhymes with Skywalker
[1:21:46] <Lizardsphere> ahem, your fence is um... smoking?
[1:21:55] <IminyourBase> now you gotta protect those nodes on the ground
[1:22:02] <%caliginouscalico> @MyNameIsRasus that's capacity, not generation
[1:22:06] <%AncelDeLambert> his fence is The Mask?
[1:22:06] <%whyskeywolfe> He's like the top half of a terminator but the bottom half and arms of a servitor
[1:22:09] <$abcismasta> @MyNameIsRasus yeah, the different grids became connected and added together
[1:22:15] <cpt_langosta> so THAT's how babby formed...
[1:22:20] <%caliginouscalico> @MyNameIsRasus he just wired in his battery grid
[1:22:23] <MyNameIsRasus> @caliginouscalico gotcha
[1:22:44] <akitanito> I can't get used to beardless pat, I thought I was in another channel
[1:22:56] <MyNameIsRasus> yeyeeyey guns
[1:22:58] <%SuckerPunchSyd> This game seems neat but that bird or animal sound is driving me nuts
[1:23:01] <%luftraumm1> beardless pat is just a thumb man
[1:23:05] <%AncelDeLambert> might want another door
[1:23:07] <IminyourBase> that one is 5 away!
[1:23:15] <%TheREALGirthMan> Spy Kids thumb person
[1:23:15] <IIVELIISCHPFULII> i read that as "Borderless Pat" like he enabled borderless fullscreen but irl
[1:23:23] <+ReallyBigRocks> who's Pat? this is Greg
[1:23:27] <%tusk102> the ambient insect noise/random bird call is sorta annoying
[1:23:30] <akitanito> these are not perfectly aligned
[1:23:34] <IminyourBase> spacing goes from 3 to 4 then 5... i hate this
[1:23:34] <%TheREALGirthMan> Beardless fullscreen
[1:23:54] <Laecerelius> Runnin outta carbonium!
[1:23:55] <%whyskeywolfe> Greg is like Wallace Shawn and John Candy had a The Thing flesh-meld.
[1:24:00] <%TheREALGirthMan> Your carbonium is cargoneium
[1:24:01] <+HefestoForges> we need more pylons

[1:24:56] <%whyskeywolfe> Can you run out of bullettos?
[1:25:00] <MyNameIsRasus> It's real cool how ths mech is killing all this wildlife to make energy for NFTs
[1:25:02] <cpt_langosta> playing Microsoft Bob would be a really smart idea

[1:25:28] <%caliginouscalico> @whyskeywolfe yes, but it varies based on tower type. the basic ones are energy powered
[1:25:31] <%AncelDeLambert> that's cuz it's just Starcraft
[1:25:35] <MyNameIsRasus> It's real dopamine inducing
[1:25:39] <Laecerelius> what was that red glowing thing?
[1:25:49] <+HefestoForges> there was*

[1:26:16] <Captain_matt> holy fuck, this is ACTUALLY just open world starcraft
[1:26:17] <%AncelDeLambert> I'm offering this deal, game. Orbital Bombardment.
[1:26:19] <senfood> God, these sound effects make me smile.

[1:27:09] <Laecerelius> it's so huge, gurl
[1:27:19] <arkv01> B I G G ?
[1:27:22] <%whyskeywolfe> Oh just noticing the new emotes now. Gettin a really Honeydew vibe from some of them.
[1:27:28] <%AncelDeLambert> well... tell your friend not to do THIS
[1:27:28] <What_Up_Duck> Yeeeah
[1:27:30] <IminyourBase> computer says no
[1:27:32] <kazadaz> Man I hope they don't attack from the south
[1:27:34] <+TIME_PUNCHER> @Lizardsphere is your name a reference to the Psychostick skit
[1:27:41] <%luftraumm1> you're going over your power budget
[1:27:41] <%caliginouscalico> @PatStaresAt watch your energy use
[1:27:45] <%AncelDeLambert> psaOrb psaBork psaElmostare
[1:27:52] <Laecerelius> it's huge!  and ead

[1:28:18] <IminyourBase> soon to be underpowered
[1:28:24] <%luftraumm1> the mods fr the weapons in this game are very cool
[1:28:32] <Lizardsphere> @time_puncher first person to bring it up in over a decade. you deserve a prize
[1:28:36] <%AncelDeLambert> LUL mistakes were made
[1:28:44] <Laecerelius> sell the north guns since there are no hives up there?
[1:28:46] <+TIME_PUNCHER> ye
[1:28:48] <%AncelDeLambert> psaGiefstare
[1:28:49] <ExpressNode> Fuck just found out a save in my game was erased and have to do a battle over again
[1:29:00] <%luftraumm1> power is at -100 and falling
[1:29:03] <%abcismasta> might want to put guns in the mining bit
[1:29:05] <%Bluwizard21> you got a problem? use gun. and if that don't work. Use more gun.
[1:29:16] <%tusk102> @PatStaresAt recycle north guns bc you destroyed the north hive?
[1:29:38] <%luftraumm1> attacks come even without hives
[1:29:43] <arkv01> the swarm approaches ScaredyCat
[1:29:50] <cpt_langosta> you can also use your drill to pierce the heavens. y'know, if you want to...
[1:29:52] <%greasypete00> holy shit the vo
[1:29:54] <lloyddboy> GET THOSE NUMBERS UP
[1:30:00] <kazadaz> I hope that the limited resources here destroy Pat's limited-resource mindgoblins and permit him to play Factorio
[1:30:21] <IminyourBase> a lucky wind
[1:30:37] <+HefestoForges> wind is being passed right now
[1:31:15] <DianaTheAscian> But what if you had MORE?
[1:31:17] <+HefestoForges> surely the tutorial swarm will be easy right
[1:31:18] <%AncelDeLambert> his batteries are gonna DIE ten seconds into the fight
[1:31:25] <@Ranryu692> what about your little outpost?
[1:31:27] <MyNameIsRasus> what if more tho
[1:31:30] <%caliginouscalico> psaSmug
[1:31:30] <%tusk102> @PatStaresAt you destroyed the north nest so maybe you could recycle some of those for more turrets south?
[1:31:34] <%tank7013> Wouldn't it be wild if you weren't though?
[1:31:36] <%abcismasta> need more power
[1:31:39] <cpt_langosta> but pat why three wall layer and not four four is even number pat
[1:31:51] <MyNameIsRasus> oh yeah the outpost
[1:31:54] <%luftraumm1> the little outpost is gonna get wrecked
[1:32:01] <+HefestoForges> energy at -4 pat
[1:32:04] <%caliginouscalico> @PatStaresAt no it doesn't, it autosave on on intervals
[1:32:06] <arkv01> the wind is pushing meeeee
[1:32:08] <kazadaz> Not enough guns, maybe add some landmines out there too
[1:32:18] <%caliginouscalico> the performance dip is real though
[1:32:23] <%D00msDayDan> when that happens just reload your save to reroll the weather effect
[1:32:30] <akitanito> that one's gone
[1:32:31] <DianaTheAscian> rip outpost
[1:32:32] <%abcismasta> oh yeah you can place unlimeted landmines
[1:32:47] <kazadaz> Damn those walls are taking it like a champ
[1:32:51] <akitanito> doing a good job as a distraction tho
[1:32:55] <cpt_langosta> shOOt the [crab]
[1:32:56] <%chance_h> Lol Mr. Riggs like he’s a pet
[1:33:08] <Laecerelius> THE CARBONIUUUUUUM!!!
[1:33:16] <Lizardsphere> ahh, they got the decoy base
[1:33:18] <%luftraumm1> purple mods over there
[1:33:26] <arkv01> MORE PYLONS
[1:33:28] <%Bluwizard21> there's quite a few of them pat, you should probably kill them
[1:33:29] <+HefestoForges> time to gtfo
[1:33:35] <%tank7013> It worked out GREAT as a decoy though
[1:33:37] <+shry7> the camera shake jesus
[1:33:43] <+kralec> the FOB is lost, fall back!
[1:33:44] <Mirrorcatch> it looks sick as hell blowing up though
[1:33:50] <%luftraumm1> red mod dropped monkaS
[1:33:55] <+HefestoForges> cue the "run" song
[1:33:57] <%tusk102> ITS FINE
[1:34:09] <kazadaz> Goddamn they never even touched the gunwall
[1:34:16] <$realm_forge> This went all Starship Troopers real quick
[1:34:19] <arkv01> this holodeck simulation a little too zealous
[1:34:32] <cpt_langosta> nice decoy base pat that was totally intentional right?
[1:34:32] <%tusk102> @PatStaresAt good decoy tho
[1:34:36] <%AncelDeLambert> huh, so they do aim at the power lines
[1:34:42] <Admiral_PopnFresh> Is this a Space Marine?
[1:34:46] <+HefestoForges> first LUL
[1:34:49] <%AncelDeLambert> now then, suck up the blood
[1:34:49] <%whyskeywolfe> ...Ashley?
[1:34:50] <%tusk102> FIRST
[1:34:51] <%tank7013> Oh no "first"? LUL
[1:35:01] <%AncelDeLambert> DRINK of the literal POOL of ichor you have made

[1:35:10] <%tusk102> hes right
[1:35:16] <wqorst> that guy sucks so bad
[1:35:21] <Treasure_Vault> Those lifeforms might be gamers, beware
[1:35:27] <DianaTheAscian> involve or die sora
[1:35:29] <+Caffienatedjedi> Time to complain about sentient vs sapient again.
[1:35:31] <+HefestoForges> thanks bear grylls-man
[1:35:36] <%tusk102> "animals dont act like that!"-woman talking about fucking aliens
[1:35:36] <Laecerelius> ADAPT OR DIE - Cloud Strife
[1:35:45] <%Reaped_Psyche> OH NO!  THEY'RE BLEEDING MT DEW EVERYWHERE!
[1:35:46] <MyNameIsRasus> yeah this side is safe probably
[1:35:48] <Explodincatz> Rules of Nature starts playing
[1:35:49] <%tank7013> You appear to be rapidly bleeding power
[1:35:53] <%AncelDeLambert> that's....one way to do it
[1:35:55] <%abcismasta> @PatStaresAt dumb animals attack closest structure, you can put decoy walls
[1:36:00] <cpt_langosta> what do you mean, man, they're animals!
[1:36:01] <Lizardsphere> thats a sturdy 3 ply fence
[1:36:07] <akitanito> lel
[1:36:10] <%AncelDeLambert> pfff
[1:36:11] <%tank7013> Aww lame
[1:36:15] <%AncelDeLambert> psaGotcha
[1:36:20] <kazadaz> I think you can shoot over the waall but not the gunwall
[1:36:22] <%luftraumm1> wall of towers
[1:36:23] <@Ranryu692> you have a minute left
[1:36:24] <+Fefe41> Nice platforms pat
[1:36:40] <Admiral_PopnFresh> you must construct addi- you know the joke
[1:36:48] <%tank7013> Just casual meteor?
[1:36:51] <DianaTheAscian> wtf was that?
[1:36:51] <%tusk102> @PatStaresAt you dont need the north guns since you destroyed that nest so maybe delete some for more south/west guns?
[1:37:13] <MrPandastic> This seems like a fun game to sink some time into.
[1:37:14] <IminyourBase> goblins are on vacation i see
[1:37:20] <cpt_langosta> what a lovely """"square"""" of generators
[1:37:27] <+Fefe41> This is what Vergil should've done, makemore wind turbines and solar panels
[1:37:30] <%AncelDeLambert> it means they just want to be friends
[1:37:34] <%AncelDeLambert> go out and give them a hug
[1:37:35] <arkv01> adapt OR DIE
[1:37:39] <%AncelDeLambert> be sure to cover yourself in honey first
[1:37:41] <%tusk102> do you?
[1:37:43] <Lizardsphere> yo threat level maximum is my favorite steven seagal movie
[1:37:45] <akitanito> half hp
[1:37:46] <kazadaz> IMO just chill in your base and see what happens

[1:38:22] <MrPandastic> OH LAWD, THEY COMIN'
[1:38:22] <%tusk102> shoulda upgraded those walls
[1:38:22] <kazadaz> Damn I didn't know Space Marine II was an RTS
[1:38:25] <@Ranryu692> theyre gonna break down that door
[1:38:29] <arkv01> THEY'RE IN

[1:39:19] <%tusk102> oh its supposed to be failed
[1:39:19] <%Dakuu75> WHAT A DICK~!!! this guy made this sim, JUST to make you lsoe on purpose
[1:39:21] <+HefestoForges> satisfactory is another game

[1:39:24] <SaltyAzteca> RICO! YOU KNOW WHAT TO DO!
[1:39:25] <%AncelDeLambert> yeah yeah yeah, thanks Captain Kirk, whatevern
[1:39:26] <cpt_langosta> good job pat, you are satisfactory
[1:39:27] <%RetroCop87> is that winnable?
[1:39:28] <Khester824> wait i never did this
[1:39:29] <%CatastropheCorvid> I wonder if you can win that.
[1:39:30] <ArcOfDeath> im pretty sure you can win
[1:39:31] <+Jack8274> Honestly still running pretty well for how much shit was on screen
[1:39:31] <%strakillias> BTW that fight is winnable
[1:39:32] <Rojahh> I just showed up what was that!?!!?
[1:39:33] <+Xelig> holy shit that was still the tutorial?
[1:39:34] <%tusk102> the fucking kobayashi maru again @PatStaresAt
[1:39:35] <Laecerelius> You shoulda hacked to win it
[1:39:37] <%AncelDeLambert> it's a Kobayashi
[1:39:39] <$realm_forge> REMEMBER YOUR TRAINING AND YOU WILL MAKE IT OUT ALIVE
[1:39:41] <+shry7> you are truly the riftbreaker
[1:39:43] <akitanito> just do better
[1:39:45] <Laecerelius> JUST CHEAT
[1:39:49] <cpt_langosta> your mom is winnable gottem
[1:39:49] <Finchit> its easily winnable
[1:39:49] <%Dakuu75> there has to be ONE insane-ass-hole out there that beat it
[1:39:49] <+ChaosedStar> Wall Wall Gun Wall Gun Wall Gun?
[1:39:50] <Laecerelius> CHEAT LIKE KIRK WOULDA DONE
[1:39:51] <%Bluwizard21> you should shoot more
[1:39:52] <Fenlig> My dog beat that tutorial
[1:39:52] <@PrefectusCorgi> Kurk it to win
[1:39:54] <MyNameIsRasus> More guns
[1:39:56] <SaltyAzteca> Is that really winnable?
[1:39:56] <%RetroCop87> crank that shit toe asy
[1:39:57] <@Ranryu692> it seems like you can plan for it better once youve seen it once
[1:39:57] <+GenesysCreed> I really don't think you could win that
[1:40:00] <%D00msDayDan> i won it in the demo, i don't know if you can still unlock research in the tutorial though
[1:40:00] <%tusk102> @PatStaresAt you had wasted money on the north and east turrets. you could have recycled them to make more west and south
[1:40:03] <%strakillias> I spent like 4 hours building a super base for it
[1:40:04] <ArcOfDeath> the survival mode is harder than that tutorial
[1:40:10] <%caliginouscalico> I fuckn lost to that one
[1:40:10] <+GenesysCreed> Jesus christ that was a lot of monsters
[1:40:14] <%tank7013> Need to raise that APM bro psaDab
[1:40:15] <Laecerelius> Yeah you now know where they all come from
[1:40:15] <Lizardsphere> make more decoy bases, that was a good trick
[1:40:15] <IminyourBase> totally winnable, i did it on my first try and a massive brain injury
[1:40:15] <%notsoy> do you even get anything for winning
[1:40:15] <$realm_forge> MOBILE INFANTRY HOO RAH
[1:40:18] <%chance_h> Sounds winnable if you knew which side they would come from
[1:40:18] <+HefestoForges> LUL
[1:40:21] <Fenlig> The purple enemies are the toughest enemies
[1:40:24] <+GenesysCreed> LOL
[1:40:25] <+Jack8274> I kinda love how bad it is
[1:40:26] <%tusk102> LMAO
[1:40:26] <kazadaz> Pat you ever play THEY ARE BILLIONS?
[1:40:28] <SaltyAzteca> NotLikeThis
[1:40:28] <@Ranryu692> psaLol
[1:40:32] <Treasure_Vault> lmao
[1:40:33] <%caliginouscalico> also no upgrade mechanics
[1:40:34] <ArcOfDeath> you dont get anything notsoy
[1:40:37] <Lizardsphere> also try spinning
[1:40:40] <+ChaosedStar> How new is this game?
[1:40:43] <$realm_forge> She has a very tall head
[1:40:44] <%Puhff> creepy49Porpkek creepy49Porpkek creepy49Porpkek
[1:40:47] <Treasure_Vault> needed at least 9 turrets
[1:40:49] <Laecerelius> gotta have multiple walls of turrets for them to have to chomp through
[1:40:54] <%Puhff> gigaboOtsMJOW1 gigaboOtsMJOW2 gigaboOtsMJOW3 gigaboOtsMJowMAX
[1:40:55] <%Cozy90> BRUTAL
[1:40:56] <arkv01> all you got are deez nuts and the swarm rushed them good
[1:40:57] <%pectusumbra> This music reminds me of Infinity Wars, very specifically, for some reason
[1:40:58] <+Jakeofalco> on the game pass!
[1:41:17] <arkv01> oh yo that looks SICK
[1:41:18] <%AncelDeLambert> that drill will break INSTANTLY
[1:41:21] <+GenesysCreed> that is confusing
[1:41:29] <fatsausagedoggo> We come in peace
[1:41:30] <%D00msDayDan> this cutscene should just play when you launch the game
[1:41:32] <%JumboCrunchies> JumboCrunchies subscribed at Tier 1. They've subscribed for 22 months! AAH SHAVEN PAT
[1:41:32] <Laecerelius> gotta poop out those cubes
[1:41:33] <SomeStrangeBroad> I'm back everyone rejoice
[1:41:35] <Lizardsphere> LOVE a tall head
[1:41:42] <+Jack8274> They spent so much money on this cut scene, have to get their worth
[1:41:47] <cpt_langosta> on no a monstar
[1:41:51] <IminyourBase> unreal engine dot asset
[1:41:53] <akitanito> we truly are the riftbreakers
[1:41:56] <arkv01> man this dev loves playing protoss
[1:42:05] <jbrachob> we truly are the RIft Breakers tm
[1:42:10] <Treasure_Vault> now we're all the riftbreaker
[1:42:10] <%RetroCop87> I guess in the end, the rift breaker was the friends we made along the way
[1:42:11] <%AncelDeLambert> Protoss is good, yes
[1:42:12] <%MrBorisMakarov> yeyeye
[1:42:12] <%strakillias> They spent like $500 on that cutscene and they will be damned if they don't get their moneys worth
[1:42:15] <%abcismasta> @IminyourBase they actually made their own engine for this
[1:42:15] <%AncelDeLambert> My life for Aiur
[1:42:17] <+Jack8274> Need additional pylons
[1:42:17] <+HefestoForges> pat just rush zealots it's ez
[1:42:17] <%barrakuta371> psaOno psaLol
[1:42:19] <%BinaryFireball> artosis just had a cramp and he doesnt know why
[1:42:20] <Lizardsphere> the real riftbreakers were the aliens we killed along the way
[1:42:24] <%BigCoffee> This feels more like playing a Terran defence map. I'd fucking play that
[1:42:27] <akitanito> you must construct additional pylons
[1:42:33] <cpt_langosta> this doesn't look anything like Microsoft Bob i feel robbed
[1:42:36] <%chance_h> Too bad your terrian
[1:42:39] <%Cozy90> RANDOM ONLY
[1:42:42] <Laecerelius> so much carbonium
[1:42:46] <azure_dunes> the real carbonium were the rifts we broke along the way
[1:42:52] <%tusk102> @PatStaresAt if you destroy a nest the enemies dont come from that direct during raids iirc
[1:42:54] <%Glass_Muffin> @PatStaresAt Whats this game about
[1:43:12] <%AncelDeLambert> remember your training, Luke
[1:43:13] <DianaTheAscian> natural walls and everything
[1:43:14] <%Dakuu75> "You have a few parts missing"?
[1:43:15] <+GenesysCreed> that's a good spot. natural barrier
[1:43:22] <%AncelDeLambert> @Glass_Muffin murderin' an' lootin'
[1:43:25] <%whyskeywolfe> God will those two just fuck already?
[1:43:32] <$realm_forge> We have arrived. Time to destroy the local environment and indigenous life.
[1:43:43] <%AncelDeLambert> lewd
[1:43:48] <%pectusumbra> oh what, a Titanfall TD/RTS
[1:43:48] <+ArtemisCroc> yeah fuck up that innocent wildlife defending its home
[1:43:55] <%StephanieSadGirl> NO, GET OUT OFF THE EGGUSSY!
[1:43:59] <MyNameIsRasus> i just saw the video of someone surviving the prologue, holy shit
[1:44:16] <%AncelDeLambert> @pectusumbra it's an old fashioned Starcraft mode but modern and not Blizzard
[1:44:17] <$realm_forge> Time to construct a new Amazon warehouse
[1:44:17] <cpt_langosta> WE MUST PROTECT THIS HOUSE
[1:44:31] <%caliginouscalico> @PatStaresAt pro tip: depletion in this game is weird, using your drill depletes deposits at a 1:1 ratio, using a mine gives you 2 resources for every one it takes from the deposit
[1:44:32] <%tank7013> I feel like a tropical rainforest on a planet like this would have a shitload of absolutely horror movie tier insects and parasites
[1:44:33] <Lizardsphere> no not there its got roaches
[1:44:42] <IIVELIISCHPFULII> if it's anything like Factorio, it provides natural choke points
[1:44:46] <jbrachob> a rock is the darksouls of fences
[1:44:50] <%MidnightBurst12> fact
[1:44:51] <%CatastropheCorvid> @tank7013 Our planet already has that.
[1:45:06] <+ArtemisCroc> like a real planet
[1:45:12] <cpt_langosta> that sound effect is too gooey for mining...
[1:45:13] <+Jack8274> It's a whole world, it's pretty cool
[1:45:26] <%D00msDayDan> this isn't like a star wars planet where there's only one biome
[1:45:38] <@Spydurman> hear that mine slush
[1:45:41] <%tank7013> @CatastropheCorvid No I mean like Birkin g-virus parasites just hanging out around here
[1:45:43] <%MelBrooksKA> Is the map random gen or is it static?
[1:45:45] <%ShinobiPhoenix> 7 minutes
[1:45:52] <%Bluwizard21> ya work 15 hours, whadda ya get? your parents go and sell you to Paris Hilton
[1:45:54] <Lizardsphere> a cliff is like a sideways ground
[1:45:57] <Rionxgarland> so earth is falaxy fracking
[1:46:02] <Rionxgarland> galaxy
[1:46:23] <cpt_langosta> wut
[1:46:45] <%Puhff> Wow ashley is just constantly wrong
[1:46:48] <%abcismasta> @MelBrooksKA random
[1:46:49] <DianaTheAscian> But the sun is free
[1:46:52] <wirbl3> god are they ever gonna shut up lmao
[1:46:53] <%CatastropheCorvid> I know what you mean Pat, but that's wrong
[1:47:02] <%abcismasta> @wirbl3 no
[1:47:10] <%CatastropheCorvid> @wirbl3 Nope
[1:47:22] <%AncelDeLambert> Ashley sucks and is stupid and is AWFUL to listen to
[1:47:31] <jbrachob> thats very wrong pat
[1:47:33] <+tempestzephyr> Big night time cometh
[1:47:34] <%Bluwizard21> but you'll drain the sun and it'll go out
[1:47:35] <%debugdrawray_> god this voice acting is fucking annoying
[1:47:37] <%CatastropheCorvid> The sun is always on!
[1:47:38] <+kralec> I mean, even cloudy, some sun still goes through, but it will not be peak energy so it's inefficient
[1:47:41] <%ShinobiPhoenix> now it feels like I skipped the tutorial or something
[1:47:42] <%Cozy90> Something about this game reminds me of the game Cyberia
[1:47:48] <tanarath> Is this Total Annihilation?
[1:47:50] <@Ranryu692> @AncelDeLambert is this Mass Effect?
[1:47:53] <%caliginouscalico> @PatStaresAt you can get free carbonium scraps by killing enemies and mowing the lawn
[1:47:53] <akitanito> just to prove you wrong
[1:47:54] <MyNameIsRasus> It's always nighttime in space tho
[1:47:54] <cpt_langosta> @AncelDeLambert true, she is the worst party member in ME1
[1:47:54] <Lizardsphere> everytime someone says carbonium, a space marine gets his armor
[1:47:58] <%ShinobiPhoenix> because now all the stuff I did is happening
[1:48:08] <%Puhff> As a joke
[1:48:10] <akitanito> Stop going green, you're here to destroy this planet
[1:48:21] <Laecerelius> Get dat carbonium, Pat!
[1:48:30] <Lizardsphere> imagine if the sun just turned off sometimes
[1:48:41] <+kralec> he needs those resources for other things
[1:48:54] <@Ranryu692> not everywhere
[1:48:54] <kbonez2> Carbonium is a hilarious name for a mineral
[1:48:56] <whittacre> Space is just night time
[1:49:03] <cpt_langosta> thats why cillian murphy needs to drop a bomb on it
[1:49:04] <%doc_ock_rokc> and pee is stored in the balls right pat
[1:49:13] <+kralec> I mean, if your solar collector can't get a direct shot to the sun, the sun is effectively off.
[1:49:14] <%luftraumm1> is this the new fact brought by rats can't swim?
[1:49:14] <MyNameIsRasus> I thought that was a massive wave of enemies for a sec
[1:49:20] <%ShinobiPhoenix> some times, these cloud people just show up and keep the sun away from you, like a jealous boyfriends
[1:49:30] <%emperordread> I hate that churn noise, sounds like someone chewing with their mouth open
[1:49:30] <+rafaelba93> when it goes bellow our flat earth
[1:49:42] <+toastybites> what is up with the goopy noise
[1:49:44] <%caliginouscalico> @PatStaresAt you know the drill depletes twice as fast as a mine, right?
[1:49:50] <+kralec> @PatStaresAt what would you do if the robot just said "you must construct additional pylons."
[1:49:54] <%StephanieSadGirl> I despise that condosending robot ai
[1:50:06] <Fenlig> When do the rifts get broken though?
[1:50:22] <%CatastropheCorvid> @StephanieSadGirl It's "Condescending" dear.
[1:50:33] <%ShinobiPhoenix> the sun won't arrive before the storm comes
[1:50:47] <%StephanieSadGirl> @StephanieSadGirl Im gonna stab you in your Corvussy
[1:50:59] <%CatastropheCorvid> @StephanieSadGirl I'm sorry, I had to.
[1:51:00] <Jakerham_Lincoln> @StephanieSadGirl Not if they're trying to transport a whole Condominium
[1:51:02] <akitanito> geothermal infinitely better
[1:51:24] <MyNameIsRasus> 1 minute and a half until the first attack monkaS
[1:51:24] <lloyddboy> one left!
[1:51:25] <+kralec> LUL the noises
[1:51:28] <%doc_ock_rokc> Of course its a Hot dig pat... Its Geo Thermal!
[1:51:32] <%StephanieSadGirl> You know tho, pat ins't wrong.  Its a Mandella effect for the song.  The real lyrics are "The sun will turn back on, tomorrow.  You can bet your bottom dollar that tomorrow, the sun will turn back on."
[1:51:44] <DianaTheAscian> sun is on
[1:51:51] <Lizardsphere> haha
[1:51:57] <cpt_langosta> good thing iron man loves hitting cap
[1:52:02] <Lizardsphere> god damnit pat
[1:52:29] <%Nobrev> I see pat went to the Ironmouse institute of astronomy
[1:52:50] <@Ranryu692> I looked away for a moment and forgot Pat shaved
[1:53:10] <%SharkMissile> This game really has 'who was in the office today' voice acting, huh?
[1:53:11] <MyNameIsRasus> god these 2 are very annoying to listen to
[1:53:16] <+kralec> was that dynamic dialogue based on your constructions? Pog
[1:53:17] <Noxarty> beardless pat looks weird
[1:53:26] <%CatastropheCorvid> This dialogue is so bad.  Like, fuck you I'M the pilot you dumbass robot.
[1:53:38] <%CatastropheCorvid> Yes
[1:53:42] <%SharkMissile> I mean, probably
[1:53:42] <%CatastropheCorvid> It does.
[1:53:46] <%caliginouscalico> it super doesnt
[1:53:48] <SaltyAzteca> Yes it makes sense. Thats a bitch thing to do DansGame
[1:53:49] <Ralfclogs> @noxarty beardless Pat looks like Greg
[1:53:53] <%SharkMissile> Speak of the devil
[1:53:57] <Lizardsphere> pat is smooth like babby
[1:53:58] <Explodincatz> smart AI
[1:54:05] <s1rcuit> @Noxarty it's mostly because we're used to him having a beard, same thing happened with me and my dad when he shaved his moustache
[1:54:15] <%SharkMissile> Yoooo dialogue doesn't match subs
[1:54:16] <%AncelDeLambert> BLAH BLAH BLAH
[1:54:16] <%CatastropheCorvid> 9 times out of 10 the ai went straight for my least defended walls.
[1:54:23] <%AncelDeLambert> BLAAAAAAAAAH
[1:54:28] <%caliginouscalico> once you know where they come from you can get away with guarding like, 1/3 of your perimeter
[1:54:31] <cpt_langosta> oh no not the jellystone interruption
[1:54:35] <%chance_h> LORE
[1:54:35] <%CatastropheCorvid> @SharkMissile I HATE that!
[1:54:44] <%AncelDeLambert> I can turn off the audio, right?
[1:54:45] <+kralec> @PatStaresAt I mean, if it's checking how much defenses you have for dialogue, it's probably checking the amount of defenses as well.
[1:54:56] <Lizardsphere> yikes this robot really does come off like a condescending asshole
[1:54:59] <dashwallkick> Storytelling everyone! Arguing colonialism with a capitalist AI!
[1:55:05] <DianaTheAscian> can u mute the dialogue in this?
[1:55:08] <+ArsCaelia> exposition yayayyayaya
[1:55:08] <@Moobot> Hey folks, just a reminder! If you have Twitch connected to Discord, you can access the PSA Sub-Discord. Go to your User Settings, go to Connections, and click 'Join' on the PSA server under the Twitch connection.
[1:55:08] <arkv01> adapt or DIE says the robot
[1:55:23] <EmptyPenguin> hippie robot
[1:55:28] <arkv01> WHAT IS SHE EVEN SAYING
[1:55:31] <stormhawk9891> TEAR IT ALL DOWN
[1:55:34] <%caliginouscalico> @DianaTheAscian not directly, but setting it 0 in options is really easy
[1:55:37] <arkv01> thats exactly what they're doing RIGHT NOW
[1:55:40] <cpt_langosta> robo-corpo-hippy-core is my jam
[1:55:45] <%MidnightBurst12> never enough factory worlds
[1:55:48] <%AncelDeLambert> lady, why did you even SIGN UP for this job?
[1:55:51] <+Jaromero435> Just wait until you can build floors
[1:56:02] <%D00msDayDan> just spam portals wherever you build anything
[1:56:02] <%Nobrev> something something emperor's glory something something for the imperium
[1:56:03] <%AncelDeLambert> really truly, why are you in this line of work? Shut up, girl
[1:56:19] <%caliginouscalico> @AncelDeLambert literally to hug alien trees
[1:56:20] <Khester824> is pat gonna wall the entire map?
[1:56:21] <%ErikFeral> A hippiecrite
[1:56:22] <sirrice77> @arkv01 don't murder the environment, try and harvest resources in a sustainable and less destructive way
[1:56:34] <dashwallkick> This is the storytelling equivalent of having the White Phosphorous scene in Spec Ops be entirely audio diaries lmao
[1:57:02] <%luftraumm1> spears  are the best weapons
[1:57:03] <%AncelDeLambert> I don't know why she's complaining about all that when she's the first boots on the ground. She literally CANNOT do enough damage on her own to have global consequences
[1:57:20] <Treasure_Vault> She's saying "mute me and listen to a podcast"
[1:57:26] <%caliginouscalico> @AncelDeLambert we unlock nukes around tier 2 or 3
[1:57:26] <%ErikFeral> @dashwallkick PBS BBC News on the history of White Phosphorus
[1:57:42] <%AncelDeLambert> @caliginouscalico still not capable of global damage
[1:57:48] <IIVELIISCHPFULII> "don't murder the environment" sounds the complete opposite of Factorio, where pretty much you want to destroy all living things due to them getting in the way of the factory
[1:57:50] <+ArsCaelia> writers clearly knew that having two characters with opposing viewpoints debate is interesting but didn't understand why
[1:58:06] <@Ranryu692> I like watching the shadows as they're being built
[1:58:29] <dashwallkick> @ErikFeral lol yes with a very concerned woman debating a robot
[1:58:36] <Lizardsphere> cant enjoy the shodo
[1:58:41] <%vehementvadr> zee, now I'm mot
[1:58:55] <Lizardsphere> cant enjoynthe shadow when the sun turns off though
[1:59:14] <%tusk102> this game looks like it constantly flips between high and low budget
[1:59:33] <whittacre> @PatStaresAt hey pat, this is probably a long shot but is there any chance of you checking out dwarf fortress once the GUI version is finished?
[1:59:52] <cpt_langosta> why always six, pat, it isnt even a multiple of five...
[2:00:10] <%abcismasta> @cpt_langosta 6 is a good number
[2:00:19] <IIVELIISCHPFULII> "once the GUI version is finished" so in like another 20 years
[2:00:34] <whittacre> lol, yeah something like that
[2:01:01] <cpt_langosta> Wall 2: Second Wall
[2:01:01] <%AncelDeLambert> you should put space between the wall layers so they focus on tearing down one barrier first
[2:01:05] <DianaTheAscian> quadruple wall
[2:01:18] <%twistedj3ster> why didn't you build 3,000 and 1 walls!
[2:01:22] <@Ranryu692> too many doors seem like a structural weakness
[2:01:46] <IIVELIISCHPFULII> dwarf fort taught me you can never have enough doors
[2:01:46] <%barrakuta371> The defense strategy reminds me of They Are Billions
[2:02:04] <%caliginouscalico> @Ranryu692 I've never seen them target doors, and they dont seem any weaker
[2:02:24] <Fenlig> @PatStaresAt have you played X-Morph: Defense, its the game the devs made before RiftBreakers, its pretty good!
[2:02:31] <%abcismasta> @caliginouscalico One door has the same health as two walls
[2:02:39] <Lizardsphere> unless he builds screen doors
[2:02:44] <%luckysteak> luckysteak subscribed at Tier 1. They've subscribed for 36 months! 
[2:02:48] <@Ranryu692> @caliginouscalico I thought I saw them targeting his door during the tutorial, but that might have just been because of crowding
[2:02:59] <%luckysteak> Gah! Smooth pat
[2:03:04] <akitanito> just make all of the walls doors
[2:03:07] <IIVELIISCHPFULII> so wait, what youre saying is you should build all your walls as doors so you basically get double walls
[2:03:09] <kazadaz> The jungle is displeasing to my eyes, please burn it down
[2:03:30] <cpt_langosta> any wall can be a door if you're angry enough
[2:03:33] <%abcismasta> no, because doors take up two spots, so they have the same health
[2:03:53] <%caliginouscalico> @IIVELIISCHPFULII one door is also 2 walls big, so they essentially have identical health values
[2:03:57] <Treasure_Vault> @cpt_langosta any door can be a wall if you give up
[2:04:07] <wqorst> what about floors
[2:04:14] <IIVELIISCHPFULII> my dream of a completely door base... shattered...
[2:04:23] <cpt_langosta> @cpt_langosta LUL
[2:04:25] <whittacre> this lush, jungle planet needs some pavement
[2:04:28] <akitanito> planet is just shitting on pat
[2:04:29] <lloyddboy> bald egg yells at cloud
[2:04:29] <%abcismasta> @cpt_langosta psaDogchamp psaDogchamp
[2:04:49] <kazadaz> There's still grass on the ground...
[2:04:56] <%caliginouscalico> pavement should be in the far right building tab
[2:04:59] <Lizardsphere> make this planet as smooth as your head
[2:05:07] <%SharkMissile> Can't we just burn this planet down and make a new one
[2:05:13] <MyNameIsRasus> planet greg
[2:05:15] <Treasure_Vault> don't it always seem to go that you don't know what you've got till it's gone
[2:05:18] <%abcismasta> @PatStaresAt do you know about the move speed boost for building floors?
[2:05:26] <+corehdavagabond> corehdavagabond subscribed with Prime. 
[2:05:27] <whittacre> that's bug
[2:05:42] <%TardyClock> Well good news, you now have two indestructible walls.
[2:05:48] <cpt_langosta> game says no door for you only wall
[2:05:50] <IIVELIISCHPFULII> on the plus side it's probably indestructible
[2:06:11] <Explodincatz> Bug is Unbreakable
[2:06:28] <kazadaz> Any bug can be a wall if you're QA enough
[2:06:51] <%Dakuu75> DE-"FENCES", HA-HA-HA... haaaa...
[2:07:09] <cpt_langosta> @kazadaz any wall can be a bug if you work at bethesda
[2:08:00] <%abcismasta> this game cured alot of my ocd for object placement
[2:08:12] <Laecerelius> good for now
[2:08:22] <kazadaz> Oh sick, like the power lines in factorio
[2:08:27] <%AncelDeLambert> ... I'm sorry, this game has HOW much dlc????
[2:08:33] <%AncelDeLambert> $90!!!
[2:08:55] <cpt_langosta> tony carbonium, poor guy, never had a chance...
[2:08:56] <jbrachob> a little more carbonara please
[2:08:59] <kazadaz> Carbonara-ium
[2:09:13] <kazadaz> Oh good, so it isn't just me
[2:09:21] <%AncelDeLambert> oh god, that's not dlc that's the devs game list, phew
[2:09:26] <Lizardsphere> more carbonaraonium for my wets
[2:09:29] <%CatastropheCorvid> @cpt_langosta "So anyway, the whole operation is run by Tony Carbonium -"
[2:09:32] <%AncelDeLambert> carbonara me
[2:09:34] <%notsoy> carbonussy
[2:09:38] <MyNameIsRasus> Would you prefer we say carbonnussy?
[2:09:40] <%Dakuu75> Carbonara was my fave food item back in FFXI
[2:09:42] <tanarath> Carbonaranium
[2:09:56] <akitanito> but you can't even tell your pastas
[2:09:56] <%SharkMissile> This robot is kind of...easily offended
[2:09:59] <%Agami23> why does the robot sound like its about to cry?
[2:09:59] <%chance_h> Feed the pat Carbon
[2:10:13] <kbonez2> we require more carbonarabussy
[2:10:18] <+ArsCaelia> some carbonara for my riggs
[2:10:18] <%chance_h> Bully the robot… sensually
[2:10:23] <%CatastropheCorvid> NO RESPONSE from the robot.
[2:10:24] <+AmanisHouseOfNonsense> I miss Ada and Jehuty
[2:10:28] <%TardyClock> Literally the closest they ever get to interesting banter is that line
[2:10:33] <Lizardsphere> wait a minute.. shes arguing with her own mech suit???
[2:10:35] <%SaiyanShoto> The carbonara effect
[2:10:36] <+ZoltanBMagnus> pat needs carbussy in order to thrive
[2:10:44] <IIVELIISCHPFULII> i prefer my robot characters having flat delivery
[2:10:50] <%abcismasta> @PatStaresAt floors are basically free, and it's super satisfying to wave them around and spawn a zillion construction things
[2:10:53] <kazadaz> That part of the wall is just cursed
[2:11:19] <cpt_langosta> lol at that last turbine
[2:11:26] <kazadaz> Oh no I'm getting that fucked up Twitch-music
[2:11:28] <Lizardsphere> better hurry, sun's about to turn off again
[2:11:48] <%abcismasta> @kazadaz nah thats just how the music sounds

I bought two of the PS1 Armored Core games on Ebay for the nostalgia,  I forgot about the mode where you customize your own in game A.I.
[2:12:19] <%SharkMissile> Since Starcraft
[2:12:26] <%SharkMissile> Oh yeah also that
[2:12:26] <cpt_langosta> one mirion troops. wow.
[2:12:35] <jbrachob> YUP

[2:12:51] <jbrachob> thats the only thing i ever did on starcraft
[2:12:54] <Explodincatz> for 1 mission only
[2:13:04] <IIVELIISCHPFULII> i can only think of those spyware game ads i see on youtube of like LAST ZOMBIE SURVIVOR or whatever
[2:13:06] <@Ranryu692> my dad's cousin burned me a copy of starcraft back in the day but I can't remember if I ever played it
[2:13:06] <DynDimAcsiwn> the world war z game satisfies that itch too
[2:13:19] <IIVELIISCHPFULII> where you have like millions of zombies running at walls of turrets
[2:13:24] <%cooldude69xx> This games got some good sound designs
[2:13:40] <cpt_langosta> @Ranryu692 read "my dad's cousin burned me" and got real concerned until the next word
[2:13:43] <%caliginouscalico> it's quite satisfying later when you have like 12 types of tower and there's a symphony of diffrent things going off at diffrent rates
[2:13:47] <jbrachob> The Carbonara is almost done
[2:13:47] <%luckysteak> Pat, can mining nodes run out of resources? if so, what do you do if everything nearby is stripped?
[2:13:47] <Treasure_Vault> Sometimes your laptop isn't plugged in. need power storage. simple.
[2:14:02] <@Ranryu692> @Ranryu692 lol
[2:14:20] <%chance_h> You move to the next one lucky
[2:14:24] <%caliginouscalico> @luckysteak yes, and expand to new ones, or use a late game item that spins rescources from absurd amounts of power
[2:14:35] <Lizardsphere> decoy base time
[2:14:36] <akitanito> peat burns goood tho
[2:14:59] <%luckysteak> @chance_h @caliginouscalico thank you guys for the  answer

[2:23:49] <IvanMistwalker> unga bunga
[2:24:04] <%Agami23> thats a fucking rad spear
[2:24:06] <%abcismasta> best melee weapon
[2:24:07] <%luftraumm1> you can put spears on both hands for maximum spearage
[2:24:07] <Laecerelius> It's basically a pilebunker
[2:24:53] <$12GaugeRager> The spear is like the edf spear and i love it
[2:24:55] <%Agami23> haha. the dialog doesent match the subtitles
[2:24:55] <cpt_langosta> did that motherfucker just mispronounce the word "Orion"?
[2:25:05] <Treasure_Vault> Replace all of this banter with titanfall 2 campaign dialogue, please.
[2:25:06] <+AmanisHouseOfNonsense> What are they fucking TALKING about?!
[2:25:09] <MyNameIsRasus> It sounds like a bad movie from the SyFy channel
[2:25:09] <%notsoy> spear seems bad for clearcutting though
[2:25:09] <@Moobot> Hey folks, just a reminder! If you have Twitch connected to Discord, you can access the PSA Sub-Discord. Go to your User Settings, go to Connections, and click 'Join' on the PSA server under the Twitch connection.
[2:25:10] <%0dokuro> the voice acting didn't match the dialogue for a second.
[2:25:11] <+rafaelba93> its the best part, it sucks so much ass
[2:25:13] <IvanMistwalker> play the sandbox mode?
[2:25:26] <LorcaNomad> @cpt_langosta oh my god he did
[2:25:26] <%Bluwizard21> i love seein spears in games. so under appreciated for being the apex weapon of 90% of human history
[2:25:28] <+cherrycottontail> Roger that. /gamestop
[2:25:30] <%luftraumm1> but you're in deficit production
[2:25:56] <%SharkMissile> Organic?
[2:25:59] <IvanMistwalker> spears satisfy my Monke Brain.
[2:26:11] <%abcismasta> this game is so good, it tickles all my bits
[2:26:15] <Laecerelius> well factorio requires things like logistics planning
[2:26:21] <%luftraumm1> better expand power and extraction
[2:26:33] <$12GaugeRager> The base building scratches the same itch that building in Supcom does.
[2:26:33] <ape_hawk> can you build lightning rods?
[2:26:37] <Fenlig> The devs also have plans for multiplayer, I cannot wait!
[2:26:48] <Laecerelius> GOING NUTSSSS
[2:26:50] <tanarath> Can you construct lightning tods for power?
[2:26:53] <%chance_h> Time to use the spear as a lightning rod
[2:27:08] <%abcismasta> no lighting rods, it just does the turbines x3
[2:27:17] <%SharkMissile> This game looks more fun than its steam page makes it look
[2:27:22] <IvanMistwalker> her character model reminds me of those adult source animations you see in adds.
[2:27:41] <%notsoy> you can move things up and down the queue
[2:27:45] <%luftraumm1> fast track more research stations for maximum researchening
[2:27:54] <akitanito> dat range
[2:27:56] <%D00msDayDan> @IvanMistwalker yeah, uh, in ads...
[2:28:09] <@Ranryu692> because it does spear things?
[2:28:24] <MyNameIsRasus> ads for the italian senate
[2:28:33] <IvanMistwalker> @d00msdaydan ( ͡° ͜ʖ ͡°)
[2:28:59] <MyNameIsRasus> wow spear is good
[2:29:01] <LorcaNomad> yo that spear fucks
[2:29:05] <Laecerelius> got so much carbonara, gurl
[2:29:14] <IvanMistwalker> spears fucks.
[2:29:15] <BigFingerRo> OH GOD I JUST GOT HERE WHY'S PAT EGG AGAIN?
[2:29:17] <MrPandastic> The quality of visuals is really amusing when you compare the humans to the level design and aliens.
[2:29:18] <%luftraumm1> i cant believe the italian senate news hit after the podcast, woolie HAS to put it in the docket
[2:29:21] <%abcismasta> and this is post-nerf spear
[2:29:28] <cpt_langosta> perfectly aligned
[2:29:47] <MrPandastic> @abcismasta Wait, how hard did the spear hit originally?
[2:29:59] <IvanMistwalker> I hate nerds spears are supposed to be OP.
[2:30:02] <%luftraumm1> use double spears!!
[2:30:07] <IvanMistwalker> *nerfs
[2:30:15] <LorcaNomad> baby
[2:30:20] <%notsoy> pig snorting lmao
[2:30:27] <IvanMistwalker> fat child.
[2:30:28] <tanarath> psaGiefrail psaGiefrail
[2:30:35] <+Mrbaconator> i wish i could hold zangief cap22Sadge
[2:30:38] <SaltyFront> snorf horf horf
[2:30:41] <%asgard147> Fatty fat boi limesAw psaDogchamp
[2:30:43] <IvanMistwalker> it's pretty loud
[2:30:43] <cpt_langosta> orc noises intensify
[2:30:44] <+Luke_Sky_Larker> gross
[2:30:50] <LorcaNomad> it's cute I love him
[2:30:53] <%notsoy> the funniest part was seeing the creator of the specific tifa porn in question acknowledging it
[2:30:56] <%maenos2> You love it
[2:30:59] <+AmanisHouseOfNonsense> It's like a Kirby inhale LUL
[2:31:00] <SaltyFront> 2 snorf 2 horf
[2:31:09] <tanarath> His shlorps are the ASMR that we crave
[2:31:16] <ll_J_A_C_K_ll> no bear pat
[2:31:19] <%D00msDayDan> you can double spear, double sword, i think even double hammer
[2:31:35] <ll_J_A_C_K_ll> beard
[2:31:35] <%abcismasta> @MrPandastic I don't think they posted the actual changes in the patch notes, but the whole upgrade tree for spears was toned down
[2:31:47] <cpt_langosta> when are you gonna mine for more beard hair?
[2:32:01] <MyNameIsRasus> damn
[2:32:09] <%luftraumm1> thats all you'1ll need for a while
[2:32:09] <%abcismasta> @MrPandastic Spear was also highest base damage in addition to everything else
[2:32:13] <IvanMistwalker> rekt.
[2:32:27] <Sternieliscious> This is just making me think of the idea of a twinstick EDF. I miss my Fencer.
[2:32:31] <%tusk102> holy shit
[2:32:33] <IvanMistwalker> it FUCKS
[2:32:41] <akitanito> double stab
[2:32:52] <SaltyFront> the enemies and gibbing remind me of the Alien Shooter series
[2:32:53] <ll_J_A_C_K_ll> poor animals
[2:32:53] <MyNameIsRasus> yo twin spear cums
[2:33:00] <+Fefe41> I come back and Pat is power stancing with two spears
[2:33:04] <%luftraumm1> it's actually a shame, i ended up using different weapons only for fun
[2:33:12] <akitanito> if the sword does sword wave, it'd be good
[2:33:17] <Lizardsphere> and it cuts the grass. bust out your mecha new balance sneakers and start mowing
[2:33:25] <MrPandastic> Jesus, I to see if there's footage of the vanilla spear cause that weapon is bonkers even in its weakened state.
[2:33:32] <%tusk102> it helps that the enemies also form lines for the spears to thrust into
[2:33:39] <%luftraumm1> you can actually buff range for melee weapons so sword can be a wave sword
[2:33:41] <cpt_langosta> first time i beat hades was with an exploding spear projectile. good times.
[2:34:04] <lloyddboy> the mecha pelvic thrust
[2:34:10] <+dieselssb> Pat has returned to egg
[2:34:10] <OkamiDude15> video game ass video games
[2:34:16] <%tusk102> @PatStaresAt spears are actually weaker than vanilla and they still slap shit
[2:34:16] <%luftraumm1> chef's kiss video gamey shit
[2:34:19] <%Bluwizard21> that looks stupid as shit thought
[2:34:34] <MrPandastic> Man this looks dumb. I love it.
[2:34:44] <+cherrycottontail> yo is that a fuckin video game?
[2:34:48] <jbrachob> Its silly how a lot of AAA games forget to just be videogames
[2:34:53] <$FriedMattato> I will never understand why people like Diablo
[2:34:53] <%Bluwizard21> thats as bad as dark souls spin halberds
[2:34:56] <+dieselssb> This reminds me of vampire survivors
[2:34:56] <%chance_h> They should have made the cover art the woman shouting .jpg
[2:35:11] <axebird> It's wild to me how many of these games are about going to another place, killing all the natives, and taking all the stuff
[2:35:15] <+cherrycottontail> also, leave it to a protos player to make a mecha spear zealot. op fuck
[2:35:20] <%D00msDayDan> god fuck hailstorms
[2:35:25] <IIVELIISCHPFULII> imagine if you started using spears for long enough, and enemies start trying to flank you instead of running straight at you
[2:35:27] <Laecerelius> ewww
[2:35:30] <LorcaNomad> @jbrachob "WE WANNA BE CINEMATIC MOVIES SO BAD THO"
[2:35:33] <%AncelDeLambert> ... were these hailstones the size of Buicks?
[2:35:34] <tanarath> oh no
[2:35:40] <+dieselssb> Yeah this is just 3d vampire survivors
[2:35:47] <MrPandastic> @jbrachob They have their hands full trying to cram as many microtransactions into their games as much as humanely possible.
[2:35:49] <%cooldude69xx> @jbrachob "WITH OUR B-PLOTS"
[2:35:58] <Laecerelius> KILL IT!
[2:36:04] <cpt_langosta> purple GLAAAAAAAAAAANS
[2:36:05] <jbrachob> Thats some elder alien shit
[2:36:08] <axebird> "discover" LUL
[2:36:10] <%strakillias> egg for egg Pat
[2:36:37] <EynoStiles> All this technology and no one thought to invent a weather sheild
[2:36:47] <Fenlig> You really need the repair towers
[2:36:48] <jbrachob> Backup Carbonara is the best carbonara
[2:36:55] <nintega010> pat shaved he's naked
[2:36:58] <lloyddboy> EGGS FOR THE EGG GOD
[2:36:58] <cpt_langosta> pat, do you think that is blue?
[2:37:06] <+dieselssb> Wait no. This is vampire survivors plus starcraft
[2:37:11] <MrPandastic> I wonder if the AI goes for openings in the walls first so you could make chokepoints and kill boxes.
[2:37:15] <Fenlig> Its a movement skill
[2:37:15] <%caliginouscalico> @PatStaresAt I once spent 15 minutes in this game fighting a single bird. It somehow could perfectly circle faster than my towers could rotate, dodging every bullet I fired and depleting all of my ammo. I couldn't fire on it cause it was above the elevation my guns could hit. I researched more towers, didn't work ,and after a frieza level fight I managed to slot 2 homing modules into the swarm missile launcher and that killed it
[2:37:16] <+Rofiarf> its a movement skill i think
[2:37:17] <SaltyFront> lol, we destroyed the artifact to discover it
[2:37:37] <%tusk102> OH NO THE CARBONIUSSY IS FULL
[2:37:42] <%asgard147> kitty limesAw psaWink
[2:37:43] <%Bluwizard21> alright, bed time. I'll catch the vod sometime. LAterz
[2:37:54] <Laecerelius> gotta research how to find cobalt
[2:38:03] <%caliginouscalico> also yeah storage units hold such a comically tiny amount of extra resources
[2:38:12] <%AncelDeLambert> WOAH that's a big tech tree!
[2:38:23] <%caliginouscalico> they really need a buff
[2:38:53] <Laecerelius> also has defense rocks around it
[2:39:02] <mortal_dragom> man watching this just makes me want elden ring more
[2:39:47] <%tusk102> @PatStaresAt is there multiple planets/zones or is the planet just absolutely stupid big
[2:39:53] <Treasure_Vault> @mortal_dragom watching silent hill makes me want elden ring more. there is noe scape
[2:40:01] <%caliginouscalico> @tusk102 multiple
[2:40:09] <%tusk102> got it
[2:40:29] <cpt_langosta> these aliens eat walls they love that shit whats up with that
[2:40:37] <+TIME_PUNCHER> I'm going to make a really lousy Factorio clone and call it Wacktorio
[2:40:38] <%caliginouscalico> @tusk102 you need the orbital scanner to go to other places, it's under construction
[2:40:43] <AKW4RD_BUFF4LO> Heyooo! Hope everyone’s having a great day!
[2:40:44] <defaultname3887> oo man you playing the genocide simulator
[2:40:47] <akitanito> so just put random chunks of walls around the perimeter?
[2:40:57] <%caliginouscalico> the walls are made of carbonaronium
[2:41:04] <cpt_langosta> kill all those blue crystals
[2:41:10] <akitanito> mowing has never been this fun
[2:41:16] <risoflavin> who is this guest host on Pat's stream?
[2:41:16] <+TIME_PUNCHER> remember it's only genocide if you manage to kill all of them
[2:41:38] <derekpwns> did Pat talk about the  Microsoft Activision acquisition already
[2:41:46] <%SharkMissile> @TIME_PUNCHER I'm writing that down
[2:41:47] <%cooldude69xx> Kotaku put out a report today where a former bioware producer, Mark Darrah, talks about how much the "bioware magic" sucked ass to be under
[2:41:53] <+Larry_Q> @risoflavin Gregg
[2:41:55] <Laecerelius> This is Gregg Spears At
[2:42:13] <cpt_langosta> sun is down
[2:42:13] <+kralec> God, the story would have been better if it was just 'you're a robot sent to prep the planet" and the robot just waxes philosophical.
[2:42:55] <+TIME_PUNCHER> EggliestGregg
[2:43:00] <akitanito> honestly it'd have been if there was no story at all
[2:43:06] <akitanito> *been fine
[2:43:07] <%tusk102> @cooldude69xx is it bc it set stupid high expectations or bc it was just getting crunched to hell for polish
[2:43:12] <%sonuke_draws> sonuke_draws subscribed with Prime. They've subscribed for 16 months, currently on a 2 month streak! Sup sup
[2:43:27] <Evil_Pineapple> I wish research wasn't just electricity. once you get geothermal and gas you instantly research everything
[2:43:39] <%cooldude69xx> @cooldude69xx Yes
[2:43:46] <$0ddeye> I was not ready for beardless Pat
[2:43:57] <Evil_Pineapple> peelt pat
[2:44:13] <%tusk102> @0ddeye who? that Gregg
[2:44:14] <akitanito> don't crazy talk yourself
[2:44:20] <%cooldude69xx> The guy has his own youtube video on it called "BioWare Magic" - Rants If you dont want to kotaku for it
[2:44:21] <MyNameIsRasus> That's our Greg
[2:44:26] <@Ranryu692> psaWrong
[2:44:32] <%JoshManVGH> How DOES he do it!
[2:44:33] <%tusk102> pats not here today so Gregg is ditting in
[2:44:33] <Dunkle321> We clapped when he said the nuts
[2:44:36] <%tusk102> sitting*
[2:44:37] <%luftraumm1> i gotta be honest this is the best RTSy stream of yours
[2:44:46] <Laecerelius> WE DO IT GOOD YEAH!
[2:44:49] <AngryAsian5> LUL
[2:44:54] <jbrachob> Greg is so much better than pat
[2:44:59] <cpt_langosta> AngriestGregg
[2:45:02] <scrumbotime> No, no, anything stupid is still Pat.
[2:45:03] <axebird> gregg
[2:45:07] <%JoshManVGH> Greg fucked it up again!
[2:45:09] <%luftraumm1> greg is the best/worst
[2:45:10] <%Agami23> it feels like a reboot of vdub
[2:45:10] <%tusk102> isnt greg the name gilgamesh goes by in ff14
[2:45:15] <$0ddeye> I miss Pat
[2:45:17] <MyNameIsRasus> Can't believe Greg is an ActiBlizz apologist
[2:45:22] <+ThomasOfTroy> Greg jokes are the replacement for angriestpat jokes
[2:45:24] <%cooldude69xx> I haven't seen a bit dry out faster than greg in some time
[2:45:24] <AngryAsian5> Greg is such an asshole
[2:45:28] <lloyddboy> Greg Greg The Gamer Egg
[2:45:37] <%JoshManVGH> Really gregging it up over here
[2:45:42] <%tusk102> @PatStaresAt greg still believes in the bioware magic
[2:45:46] <%RealThiele> Greg hates those Al bheds
[2:46:00] <+Rofiarf> no
[2:46:04] <MyNameIsRasus> Greg believes in the 3 Bs
[2:46:07] <%JoshManVGH> Monsters will eat those wires
[2:46:17] <%sonuke_draws> I don’t know bruddah
[2:46:19] <Laecerelius> WIIIIND!
[2:46:21] <ammobasket> i dunno, maybe it can be more like a mediocre thing, like, 'that's just Greg'
[2:46:27] <%luftraumm1> gotta research alternate energy sources
[2:46:37] <%tusk102> greg was that fucker at woolies QA job who didnt recognize the final fantasy victory jingle
[2:46:42] <%luftraumm1> Greg's a normie
[2:47:31] <akitanito> wind's slow on sunny days
[2:47:34] <Laecerelius> I imagine all of those AI cores didn't help
[2:47:35] <MyNameIsRasus> Shut up toaster
[2:47:41] <%luftraumm1> @PatStaresAt you'll only go so far with basic power sources
[2:48:22] <MyNameIsRasus> ON GOD?
[2:48:24] <akitanito> just fill that map
[2:48:26] <Laecerelius> Not if you spam them hard enough!
[2:48:27] <%luftraumm1> i bet on it
[2:48:31] <%RealThiele> co-ball handling
[2:48:44] <+Rofiarf> you do wanna get that sweet geothermal energy though
[2:48:46] <Fenlig> Fusion though
[2:48:58] <%luftraumm1> co-ball handling is a different form of bro-job
[2:49:41] <Fenlig> The probably with large solar and wind fields is that you have to spread out your defensive line
[2:49:57] <ape_hawk> hehe, boner
[2:49:59] <%shurtal> more like Carbonerum
[2:50:05] <Fenlig> problem *
[2:50:23] <%luftraumm1> its just a node
[2:50:42] <cpt_langosta> @luftraumm1 did you say nerd?
[2:50:44] <r0chelimit> Just got in is this a good one?
[2:50:44] <Fenlig> Its nice when you can put down flooring
[2:51:04] <r0chelimit> a good game i mean, I saw it on game pass
[2:51:23] <Laecerelius> nice
[2:51:24] <lloyddboy> hot yeah?
[2:52:07] <%caliginouscalico> @PatStaresAt @randy your queue
[2:53:01] <@Ranryu692> psaBlep psaBlep psaBlep psaBlep psaBlep psaBlep psaBlep
[2:53:08] <akitanito> can't see shit
[2:53:18] <%AncelDeLambert> dude, it sounds like Paige doing The Grudge
[2:53:26] <%AncelDeLambert> I thought that was my stomach
[2:53:29] <%luftraumm1> the gameplay loop of queueing research and going off to explore is super satisfying
[2:53:34] <cpt_langosta> carbobarbie
[2:54:13] <%luftraumm1> on KB+M you can zoom in/out on the minimap its pretty useful
[2:54:30] <Laecerelius> took some of that big damage
[2:55:02] <+cherrycottontail> that's a fuckin nydus worm
[2:55:10] <+cherrycottontail> that nest
[2:55:10] <@Moobot> Hey folks, just a reminder! If you have Twitch connected to Discord, you can access the PSA Sub-Discord. Go to your User Settings, go to Connections, and click 'Join' on the PSA server under the Twitch connection.
[2:55:12] <Laecerelius> nice, free cobalt
[2:55:12] <%SharkMissile> If she's in the mech imagine how big that thing is.... monkaS
[2:55:14] <notaplushtoy> this game gives me big starcraft vibes
[2:55:24] <cpt_langosta> the enemy floor anus has been defeated
[2:55:43] <%luftraumm1> dont forget you have a heal
[2:55:52] <%tank7013> Was that one cloaked?
[2:56:28] <%tusk102> or other power researched
[2:56:34] <Laecerelius> maybe research geothermal?
[2:56:42] <%caliginouscalico> @tank7013 yeah there's totally cloaked enemies. you can even get cloaking by scanning enough of them
[2:57:11] <%tank7013> @caliginouscalico Oh cool
[2:57:33] <%caliginouscalico> @PatStaresAt you can just mouse over the whole tree and see what it unlocks, even without unlocking the prerequisites
[2:57:41] <%RealThiele> ironic
[2:57:49] <EynoStiles> the irony of build wind generators between rock formations
[2:57:58] <+Romuken> Will Paige play necromancer in DS3 Convergence?  Also my friend streamed this game for me a while ago and it looks SICC, hope you're enjoying it bunches.
[2:58:44] <+Rofiarf> geothermal is great
[2:59:07] <MyNameIsRasus> Geothermal plants irl rule
[2:59:22] <b0n3_daddy> is this like space CIV?
[2:59:37] <%JoshManVGH> Did your new corner section of wind turbines get connected to your powergrid?
[2:59:39] <%caliginouscalico> geothermal can be kinda annoying until you get stuff that eats water cause it will stop producing if the pipe network fills up
[2:59:41] <%abcismasta> if you drop mines, they stop to attack them
[3:00:09] <+Romuken> Jaaames Jacob, Jingleheimerschmitt
[3:00:10] <lloyddboy> jean halo
[3:00:20] <MyNameIsRasus> @b0n3_daddy this is factorio + tower defense
[3:00:24] <%RealThiele> jilling halo
[3:00:35] <%SaiyanShoto> Jean Hola
[3:00:38] <%tank7013> Oh that's a good shotgun
[3:00:48] <%caliginouscalico> this game has a GREAT shotgun
[3:00:50] <%luftraumm1> every non automatic weapon can be charged, its so stupid cool
[3:00:54] <MyNameIsRasus> more than enough to kill anything that moves
[3:00:59] <+Romuken> Oh boy look it's John Madden Halo
[3:01:07] <Bottulism> Oh thank christ Im not the only one baby faced today
[3:01:13] <+younger54> I like the flamer
[3:01:19] <Bottulism> At least I still have a glorious mustache though
[3:01:27] <cpt_langosta> oh wow, look at that PURPLE pod thing over there!
[3:02:00] <+Romuken> big blurple
[3:02:08] <Bottulism> ZERG RUSH
[3:02:29] <+Rofiarf> i think it just spawns a new wave
[3:02:47] <+Romuken> look at all of those blue raspberries
[3:02:56] <+Complete_Phased> WTB pickup radius
[3:03:21] <Laecerelius> Gotta get that vacuum mod
[3:03:21] <Bottulism> This sounds like alternate universe Gregory and Freddy
[3:03:27] <%Bailey__Gaming> I like the demo of this I hope the full game is gooe
[3:03:44] <%blastyoboots> Additional Pylon plants
[3:03:47] <%Bailey__Gaming> CONSTRUCT ADDITIONAL PYLONS
[3:03:56] <Bottulism> The solution is always more turrets
[3:04:08] <Bottulism> The less game you have to play the better
[3:04:09] <%abcismasta> a single healy boi can completely sustain everything it covers until mid game
[3:04:13] <+Romuken> WE REQUIRE MORE VESPENE GAS
[3:04:21] <lloyddboy> whatever you say greg
[3:04:24] <TheeRabbi> it's like they put a  twin sticker shooter I would love to play and stuffed it inside a grid management base builder I have no interest in

[3:05:07] <Bottulism> Do you have enough redstone to hook those up?
[3:05:07] <%luftraumm1> GregGaspsAt
[3:05:12] <derekpwns> Greg the egg
[3:05:19] <+Romuken> Watch Gregs and Gregcessories
[3:05:26] <Treasure_Vault> Does this game do copy and paste blueprints?
[3:05:27] <cpt_langosta> BIG fuckin SPIDER

[3:05:38] <MyNameIsRasus> Certified Greg™ moment
[3:05:43] <+Romuken> zitoGun
[3:06:23] <%luftraumm1> @maenos2 i was gonna write that nut preferred not to imagine it
[3:06:23] <%abcismasta> the monsters will always attack the closest structures to their spawn, even if it's super far from the base
[3:06:33] <%abcismasta> @Treasure_Vault not yet
[3:06:35] <Bottulism> But can you give the walls guns
[3:06:56] <%maenos2> @luftraumm1 heh sorry.  i had to say it.  if i  had to suffer, so too do others
[3:07:06] <MyNameIsRasus> gunwalls. the natural evolution
[3:07:08] <%abcismasta> build a spire of wall out from the base and they'll attack it
[3:07:24] <%luftraumm1> @maenos2 yeah that caused some damage
[3:07:28] <@Ranryu692> GreggNegsEgg
[3:07:30] <%Bailey__Gaming> psaElmostare
[3:07:43] <%0dokuro> You know what Gregg, youre pretty smart
[3:07:46] <SpookedAves> interested to see how this is been watching it since early access
[3:08:12] <%luftraumm1> @PatStaresAt you're gonna have to expand sooner or later so might as well expand in that direction
[3:08:16] <EynoStiles> Is there a game like this but with insects?
[3:08:18] <%blistexthief> Rocks are free walls
[3:08:25] <%abcismasta> oh, the answer to that area is research the artillery pieces @PatStaresAt
[3:09:41] <%Agami23> hyperviolence hasent failed you yet
[3:09:47] <Laecerelius> free immortal walls
[3:09:55] <%tusk102> i feel like reinforcing walls is better than making multiple weak walls
[3:10:16] <%DashXero> What's the goblin rating of this game?
[3:10:22] <%abcismasta> I don't know if you noticed, but structures with aoes show up on the minimap while you place them
[3:11:58] <Laecerelius> not gonna put a repair tower in the battle nook?
[3:12:20] <MyNameIsRasus> battle nook is a strong name
[3:12:33] <fistynopunches> is this a starcraft type thing?
[3:12:53] <+Rofiarf> rocket imo
[3:12:58] <%CatastropheCorvid> Breakfast Nook. Coffee Nook. Battle Nook. Makes sense.
[3:12:58] <%abcismasta> they're all really strong
[3:13:03] <%abcismasta> the mines are persistent
[3:14:02] <MyNameIsRasus> How is Tom Nook related to the Battle Nook
[3:14:06] <%abcismasta> all explosive weapons share ammo
[3:14:17] <+Rofiarf> i like having different ammo types on each arm
[3:14:18] <%edibleskeleton> rift break my bussy Pat
[3:14:33] <MyNameIsRasus> wow
[3:14:48] <Laecerelius> most of it
[3:15:40] <LeotheHuntsman> sweet jesus what happened to the beard
[3:15:42] <%shurtal> a little fucky wucky
[3:15:54] <Laecerelius> Pat became Gregg
[3:15:55] <%Agami23> that is literally a magic tower with a orb shooting healing magic
[3:16:00] <MyNameIsRasus> some tomfoolery is afoot
[3:16:02] <+Piemen99> A factorio -like?
[3:16:20] <Explodincatz> u able to add a 3rd layer of wall?
[3:16:38] <%tusk102> @edibleskeleton your carbonussy
[3:17:08] <MyNameIsRasus> man this game makes me wanna play satisfactory again
[3:18:41] <%JoshManVGH> Does it?
[3:18:54] <+Romuken> Could make two sets of double-thick walls and fill it with turrets
[3:18:55] <TurtlesAndTentacles> I'm not a fan of these kinds of games but I miss hearing Pat speak lol. so here I lurk
[3:19:04] <Treasure_Vault> put a space, then a second layer of double gates?
[3:19:07] <+Romuken> but this works well and doesn't use up a lotta resources like that would
[3:19:12] <Explodincatz> add it not near the door
[3:19:14] <%JoshManVGH> If you reverse one of the doors it's super easy to walk through 3 layer doors
[3:19:17] <%Valask> Valask subscribed at Tier 1. They've subscribed for 7 months! FUCK YOU IT'S STILL JANUARY
[3:19:30] <Joem1k> wait, is Pat having a guest over, whose this playing right now? Kappa
[3:19:35] <%JoshManVGH> Three layer walls, yeah
[3:20:12] <Fenlig> You can eventually upgrade the walls
[3:20:15] <+Romuken> Walls, turrets, walls?  Like a dangerous oreo.
[3:20:21] <Laecerelius> oh man, energy go big down at night
[3:20:25] <Treasure_Vault> Too bad you can't build moats. Good ol' moats. Unbreachable.
[3:20:45] <+Romuken> LOOKIT GO
[3:20:52] <+Indigo_909> Indigo_909 subscribed with Prime. 
[3:21:06] <%abcismasta> good ol rock, nothin beats that!
[3:21:32] <+Romuken> gawd the spears are so meaty
[3:21:54] <Treasure_Vault> Are there good god games anymore?
[3:22:17] <%Valask> This is what will happen whenever we discover a plane with alien life, genocide
[3:22:18] <%JoshManVGH> Oh you know what, I never realized you could make doors kiss, so I've always done 3 layer walls, with like the outer door backwards, so it's like a little airlock.
[3:22:20] <+Romuken> rocket time
[3:22:27] <Laecerelius> Battle!  Mudman!
[3:22:31] <%DashXero> Man... That voice is really bossy.
[3:22:33] <%tank7013> That... is really not an enemy type I was expecting
[3:23:10] <%chance_h> Game lagged and saved, time for the swarm
[3:23:22] <%JoshManVGH> Sounds like it's doing fine
[3:23:32] <%JoshManVGH> Many enemy bloods for sure
[3:23:56] <%JoshManVGH> Do you have the auto repair towers yet?
[3:24:03] <%JoshManVGH> Oh you do!
[3:24:17] <Laecerelius> your night time power situation is not great
[3:24:27] <%notsoy> vergil was right
[3:24:42] <%SodiumPatrol> lytMOTIVATED lytMOTIVATED lytMOTIVATED
[3:24:51] <+Akabane101> What type of game is this?
[3:25:06] <Laecerelius> maybe more energy storage?
[3:25:23] <%JoshManVGH> @akabane101 Build base, fight zerg, don't die, optimize and automate
[3:25:30] <+Romuken> murder them for the biogenerator?
[3:25:31] <@Moobot> Hey folks, just a reminder! If you have Twitch connected to Discord, you can access the PSA Sub-Discord. Go to your User Settings, go to Connections, and click 'Join' on the PSA server under the Twitch connection.
[3:25:36] <%JoshManVGH> What's your battery situation?
[3:25:39] <+Akabane101> @JoshManVGH oooo sounds interesting! Thank you :)
[3:25:42] <%DashXero> Every time I hear "more power" I expect the Tim Allen grunts....
[3:25:45] <%abcismasta> didn't you research tier 2 power already? can you upgrade the buildings you have?
[3:25:50] <nepwar> oh man its been a minute since I gazed at pat's bare chin
[3:26:00] <%JoshManVGH> Night suplus can hurt!
[3:26:52] <%JoshManVGH> Those second level turbines and solar panals are going to be super nice
[3:26:58] <+Hacerous> I know you might be a ways off. But i encountered a bug with the rift gate. Dont try to turn it on till all the objectives are fulfilled.
[3:29:00] <%chance_h> Pincher attack, check the south
[3:29:10] <%JoshManVGH> Love those little fixit drones
[3:29:55] <%JoshManVGH> Boooo
[3:30:09] <MyNameIsRasus> any minute now
[3:30:17] <%AncelDeLambert> EVERY damn time he turns that thing on I think it's my stomach rumbling
[3:30:26] <Laecerelius> Much needed power increase
[3:30:34] <+Hacerous> eventually
[3:30:35] <%JoshManVGH> Yeah.
[3:30:43] <%AncelDeLambert> Cobalt is a mineral IRL, so probably
[3:30:49] <Laecerelius> oh man look at that power increase
[3:31:07] <+Hacerous> but it kinda breaks your progression if you got a lot early
[3:31:42] <akitanito> no more power lol
[3:31:44] <%JoshManVGH> Cobalt mining is one the right side of one of the tech trees, special material handling or something
[3:31:46] <lloyddboy> LUL
[3:31:50] <MyNameIsRasus> LUL
[3:31:57] <+Hacerous> Charge!
[3:32:04] <%AncelDeLambert> LUL
[3:32:07] <%D00msDayDan> we should go to its location and fuck its ass up
[3:32:09] <%AncelDeLambert> you're doomed
[3:32:14] <%D00msDayDan> the build limit is for research structures and armories only
[3:32:16] <Laecerelius> geothermal power
[3:32:17] <akitanito> oh, so you can't just spam wind and solar?
[3:32:43] <%JoshManVGH> Optimize!
[3:32:51] <TheSinner42> only for 2 or 3 buildings
[3:33:02] <%SharkMissile> More Kobolds?
[3:33:14] <+Hacerous> for some of them, important structures like hubs. i think ammo storage as a very low limit
[3:33:36] <%JoshManVGH> Don't forget, at night you can turn off the giant antenna, it draws a lot of power
[3:33:37] <+Hacerous> Pierce the Heavens!
[3:33:38] <+Romuken> @SharkMissile zitoGun
[3:34:15] <+Hacerous> geo is decent, but mud is the best imo
[3:34:20] <+Hacerous> such a good resource
[3:34:38] <%JoshManVGH> Geothermal starts at 200
[3:34:56] <%StephanieSadGirl> Mud Mussy?
[3:34:56] <MyNameIsRasus> Is the unusually large creature deez nuts
[3:35:07] <%DashXero> Maybe they're pulling a Zorah Magdaros, and we're ALREADY ON the large creature...
[3:35:16] <@Ranryu692> don't you mean Mega Man
[3:35:16] <+Hacerous> Alien war!
[3:35:24] <%StephanieSadGirl> YEAH PAT, THRUST THAT RUSSY!
[3:35:24] <akitanito> LUL
[3:35:29] <Treasure_Vault> Someone mentioned this game needs co-op. They were right. Do y'all prefer co-op where you're both armed equally or specialized? Two assault rifles vs a shotgun and a sniper rifle.
[3:35:34] <theloverobot> Thats Kaiju from PAcific Rim
[3:35:37] <%JoshManVGH> yeah over time. but you also get mud, wich you can filter to water
[3:35:53] <Laecerelius> man i'd love to play this game co-op
[3:35:59] <+Romuken> rockets?
[3:36:06] <%JoshManVGH> then use water to grow plants, the harvest plants for GAS
[3:36:31] <%DashXero> Super fighting robot...
[3:36:56] <akitanito> just a few more shots
[3:36:57] <+Hacerous> blow his back out!
[3:37:04] <akitanito> golem?!
[3:37:05] <+Romuken> rock lobster
[3:37:16] <%SharkMissile> Man this planet fucks
[3:37:16] <%StephanieSadGirl> Another dude wanting his russy thrusted
[3:37:20] <Laecerelius> The rocks are attacking!!
[3:37:22] <%JoshManVGH> Elemental, you know, like on normal planets
[3:37:25] <Explodincatz> @Treasure_Vault equal, otherwise u get scenarios where someone is forced to use the unfun weapon
[3:37:41] <%RealThiele> cobalt golems
[3:37:48] <%RoggleJr> RoggleJr subscribed with Prime. They've subscribed for 20 months! 
[3:38:11] <%JoshManVGH> It's good shit.
[3:38:18] <%abcismasta> make sure to grab the tower ammo tech so that when the ranged enemies show up you aren't screwed
[3:38:25] <Laecerelius> you got some cobalt from killing that mini boss
[3:38:28] <%RoggleJr> Love what you do and keep it up my dude.
[3:38:31] <+Hacerous> not till you invest in alternative drilling
[3:38:35] <%tank7013> Mixing in fantasy enemies with the sci fi alien monsters is weird but I like it
[3:38:40] <%luftraumm1> there are resources that come from other places in the planet @PatStaresAt
[3:38:43] <+Hacerous> very heavy sfx
[3:38:46] <Fenlig> A real moist game indeed
[3:38:49] <+Hacerous> i was addicted instantly
[3:38:58] <+Romuken> pizzazz?
[3:39:00] <Treasure_Vault> @Explodincatz You're not wrong, but I wish you were.
[3:39:04] <%RealThiele> number go up
[3:39:06] <%luftraumm1> i killed a lot of time with it
[3:39:15] <%JoshManVGH> Lost about 7 hours picking it up on a whim
[3:39:17] <+Plus_On_Black> Colonizers in Space
[3:39:20] <Laecerelius> i mean the rock monsters don't seem too odd.  They could not be made of rocks but just have a hard shell that looks like rocks.
[3:39:27] <SaltyFront> yeah, all the splatter FX reminds me of the gore from Alien Shooter 2
[3:39:42] <%abcismasta> I think it gave you a marker in the south west when the cobalt objective was active, it's a dark blue on the minimap @PatStaresAt
[3:39:43] <%JoshManVGH> Gentrify the planet, Greg!
[3:40:03] <SaltyFront> In that game you could cover the floor in alien guts until you would leave footprints in it
[3:40:13] <%abcismasta> oh no
[3:40:21] <%JoshManVGH> Meg
[3:40:25] <%luftraumm1> yeah...a bit
[3:40:25] <akitanito> just "kind of"
[3:40:28] <%JoshManVGH> Meh I mean
[3:40:31] <+Hacerous> i think its a lil smole.. thered18Creep
[3:40:47] <%RealThiele> this is making me wanna play terraria
[3:40:49] <+Hacerous> i want all the resources, koefCreep
[3:40:55] <%tusk102> @PatStaresAt remind yourself that overconfidence is a slow and insidious killer, greg
[3:41:01] <+OG_M_Bison> Oh Jesus Pat shaved
[3:41:09] <kbonez2> is this game really good? because it seems pretty cool
[3:41:09] <+OG_M_Bison> I'm not used to this
[3:41:10] <%JoshManVGH> If you can build a second research building, it gets faster
[3:41:27] <%DashXero> Where's the coal?
[3:41:35] <Dova573> Additional Pylons required
[3:41:42] <+OG_M_Bison> Pat's face looks so naked right now
[3:41:42] <%luftraumm1> thats the one
[3:41:46] <+Hacerous> animal mass kinda sucks imo
[3:41:46] <+OG_M_Bison> But it's still a good look
[3:42:25] <Treasure_Vault> Do bastions work against the AI in this game?
[3:42:34] <akitanito> isn't that precisely why it would be balanced to suck?
[3:42:37] <%JoshManVGH> Yeah but it burns quick
[3:42:39] <%tusk102> but its useless when there arent enemies around the base @PatStaresAt
[3:42:41] <Laecerelius> there's a vent right next to your bottom right base
[3:42:56] <%JoshManVGH> Mmmm power
[3:43:03] <%tusk102> and it burns very fast
[3:43:23] <+Hacerous> they enemies are finite until you are hit by the waves. Ratio isnt efficient imo
[3:43:28] <HarshNerf> is this game like factorio?
[3:43:48] <%JoshManVGH> Plant mass is way better
[3:43:49] <%luftraumm1> factorio light kinda
[3:43:54] <+Hacerous> and i dont think there is a way to breed wildlife
[3:43:55] <%AncelDeLambert> Factorio is heavily defined by it's assembly lines
[3:43:58] <Laecerelius> there isn't any logistics stuff but more mosnter killing
[3:43:58] <%AncelDeLambert> so, no
[3:44:02] <Fenlig> More Objective based and less factory based thatn Factorio
[3:44:19] <%AncelDeLambert> LOGISTICS, thank you, for fucks sake my brain has been trying to find that word for three hours!
[3:44:25] <%tusk102> its more just a top down rts game
[3:44:27] <%luftraumm1> this does'nt have assembly lines, escept some late game resources
[3:44:33] <+quackisalive> Who is this guy and where is Pat?
[3:44:35] <+Hacerous> thats mud
[3:44:36] <HarshNerf> oh nice I'm always down for more logistics based games
[3:44:36] <%tusk102> with direct control
[3:44:41] <%luftraumm1> it puts out mud, that you can filter
[3:44:45] <%JoshManVGH> You can build liquid storage to hold mud.
[3:44:49] <%AncelDeLambert> this is just a resource heavy turret defense game
[3:44:50] <+Hacerous> you have to store or process the mud
[3:45:02] <%JoshManVGH> Then mud can be filtered to clean water
[3:45:05] <%tusk102> @PatStaresAt the reason the animal mass one isnt great is cuz it burns fast and without waves there is a finite amount of enemies on the map
[3:45:15] <%luftraumm1> you don't HAVE to @PatStaresAt
[3:45:20] <Fenlig> Geo Thermal plants output Mud and Power
[3:45:24] <%JoshManVGH> Research liquid material handling
[3:45:26] <Treasure_Vault> Maximize your krimblo per hour
[3:45:53] <%JoshManVGH> Perfect
[3:45:54] <Laecerelius> barely any energy deficit at night now, nice
[3:46:03] <+Hacerous> I dont think it generates power unless you process the mud
[3:46:05] <%luftraumm1> skrimblos per hour are under the bimblo treshold
[3:46:25] <HarshNerf> @luftraumm1 worduple?
[3:46:33] <%tusk102> @luftraumm1 not if i use my glup shitto particles
[3:46:40] <MyNameIsRasus> Battle nook gonna put in some work this time
[3:46:51] <+Hacerous> filtering the mud to water is best
[3:47:13] <Laecerelius> oh yeah battle nook needs a healer if you got enough cobalt from killing that miniboss
[3:47:22] <Treasure_Vault> research biff blumbo for low-cost, high-yield bibble
[3:47:22] <%luftraumm1> @tusk102 are you maximizing your sleazebagano yield?
[3:47:25] <HarshNerf> lmao that tts voice freaked me out, thought it was someone talking into the mic
[3:47:49] <%tusk102> @luftraumm1 yeah but i have to be careful cuz otherwise the scrunklies get angry
[3:48:21] <%JoshManVGH> Once you have water you'll be one step closer to CONSUME BIOMASS!
[3:48:31] <+Hacerous> Ya i dont think the plants are generating power atm since you are running a power deficient
[3:48:33] <bippityjones> FUCK this game is so 2007
[3:48:36] <%luftraumm1> @tusk102 scWunkWies?
[3:48:59] <%tusk102> @luftraumm1 scwunkwy wunkwies
[3:49:10] <Treasure_Vault> You didn't know! Knowing is half the battle in these games. Efficiency has to be taught by failure.
[3:49:39] <%JoshManVGH> @hacerous They are producing power, but he added like 50 things to the grid after.
[3:49:41] <%luftraumm1> @tusk102 we have degenerated into internet UwUisms
[3:49:50] <Laecerelius> Pat, maybe you should expand this base a bit to the left and get that geothermal plant
[3:50:07] <%tusk102> @luftraumm1 its bound to happen after passing the himbo threshold
[3:50:07] <Mottyrob> Two spears? What is this, EDF?
[3:50:16] <+trackles_64> the dowload times are obnoxious
[3:50:27] <kingra> D-Dud Pat shave?
[3:50:36] <%JoshManVGH> Basically you plop them down and the can output both mud and power, but you aren't required to use both all the time.
[3:50:40] <kingra> He looks weird in the cam
[3:50:41] <+Hacerous> @JoshManVGH Oh ok. It was my understanding that unless the "waste" of the plant was processed it is on standbye
[3:50:45] <%tusk102> @kingra no thats greg
[3:50:58] <%tusk102> @kingra also on a serious note yes he did shave
[3:51:01] <bippityjones> Just a few lil guys
[3:51:07] <IminyourBase> you're still rocking the basic tower?
[3:51:22] <MyNameIsRasus> monkaS
[3:51:22] <%tusk102> switch to the rocket launcher maybe
[3:51:23] <Laecerelius> wow
[3:51:24] <%JoshManVGH> Elementals awoken
[3:51:29] <HarshNerf> those rockmen are fucking that wall up
[3:51:29] <+trackles_64> Rock men
[3:51:39] <bippityjones> getting WRECKED by rockmen
[3:51:47] <%caliginouscalico> @PatStaresAt rock men have physical and energy resistance,  but HATE explosions
[3:51:53] <%JoshManVGH> Wow fucker wants in
[3:51:57] <+Hellarussian> is this the new Bloons update?
[3:52:04] <+trackles_64> your wallls were weak
[3:52:11] <Laecerelius> rock men don't fuck around
[3:52:20] <%tusk102> @PatStaresAt they ARE level 1 walls. also the rock men are weak to explosions
[3:52:23] <Explodincatz> the first real threat
[3:52:27] <%notsoy> the "resist" alert came up a lot, your turrets were too shitty
[3:52:32] <%JoshManVGH> Yeah uh... how the hell did giant bolder sneak up on the base
[3:52:34] <%luftraumm1> they scale with your research or story rogression iirc @PatStaresAt
[3:52:51] <MyNameIsRasus> need some kind of explosive turrets against them, i'm guessing
[3:53:00] <%CalderGaming> i am absolutely livid that I don't have a megaman emote for this
[3:53:04] <Laecerelius> OOOOH!  explosive towers!
[3:53:14] <%JoshManVGH> Rocket towers are outstanding
[3:53:22] <%tusk102> @PatStaresAt xplosive towers for rockmen
[3:53:46] <HarshNerf> rock beats laser is a weird concept to put in a logistics game
[3:53:47] <%chance_h> Now we’re missile tower defense-ing
[3:53:54] <%caliginouscalico> you unlock download hub upgrades and more of them by base upgrading
[3:54:00] <%notsoy> o ya u never did get far enough in factorio to see the artillery turrets
[3:54:10] <+trackles_64> your stoarge isfull
[3:54:28] <%StephanieSadGirl> your Storussy is full
[3:54:28] <%chance_h> Splat
[3:54:29] <%tusk102> @HarshNerf a fine tuned laser putting a perfect tiny hole in a rock does less damage then an explosion hitting a rock to be fair
[3:54:44] <MyNameIsRasus> that bird sounds like a chocobo
[3:54:44] <%Dakuu75> this game is basically monster hunter when you think about it... gotta kill all the wildlife'n such~
[3:54:50] <%JoshManVGH> Pumps are for when you find pools
[3:54:58] <Treasure_Vault> I wish Satisfactory didn't have alternative recipes.
[3:55:21] <%JoshManVGH> Nows the time on sprocket when we dance!
[3:55:33] <%chance_h> And monster hunter is basically dark souls. So is this the dark souls of tower defense games?
[3:55:34] <@Moobot> Hey folks, just a reminder! If you have Twitch connected to Discord, you can access the PSA Sub-Discord. Go to your User Settings, go to Connections, and click 'Join' on the PSA server under the Twitch connection.
[3:55:36] <%caliginouscalico> artillery towers are the real value
[3:55:38] <%tusk102> this gonna be a one and done?
[3:55:43] <Treasure_Vault> That is a fun fact. I had fun.
[3:55:53] <%tusk102> rip
[3:55:55] <%caliginouscalico> cause they have the range to hit ranged enemies
[3:56:00] <%D00msDayDan> you wanna see how well this game really runs try unlocking the camera zoom
[3:56:12] <%caliginouscalico> also save that praise for trying to switch regions
[3:56:15] <+trackles_64> fre power
[3:56:22] <%caliginouscalico> load times are bloddborne tier
[3:56:28] <%tusk102> mudmen?!
[3:56:30] <%WaitHowDidIGetHere> WaitHowDidIGetHere subscribed at Tier 1. They've subscribed for 7 months, currently on a 5 month streak! Patrick want big boom.
[3:56:33] <%luftraumm1> rts adjacent content is not very successful in streaming
[3:56:44] <+trackles_64> its basicallly avatar
[3:56:57] <+LazyBumNetwork> Diablo lookin kinda different today
[3:57:24] <%WaitHowDidIGetHere> Surprise, bitch! It's Ego the Living Planet!
[3:57:33] <Treasure_Vault> @luftraumm1 I dunno, almost anything is a good one-off.
[3:57:38] <HarshNerf> if avatar 2 has rock men vs mechs then i declare it will be successful
[3:57:49] <%JoshManVGH> What sucks about the edges of the map, is that the boundary limit is for the player only. NPCs can totally walk around out there.
[3:57:52] <%Valdorick> Valdorick subscribed at Tier 1. They've subscribed for 29 months! 
[3:58:00] <%tusk102> @LazyBumNetwork dude no its not dont you have a phone Kappa
[3:58:20] <%luftraumm1> @Treasure_Vault yeah, one offs are great, but what was the last long series?
[3:58:29] <%JoshManVGH> And on my map, the only source of cobolt was butted RIGHT on the top edge of the map
[3:58:54] <+trackles_64> Hey guys
[3:58:55] <+Romuken> well then
[3:58:59] <%JoshManVGH> "Hello friens...."
[3:59:03] <%tusk102> @luftraumm1 ds3 convergence is gonna be to the end i thought
[3:59:09] <Pookiedaexzile> Oh Gregs still guest starring
[3:59:47] <+trackles_64> need mreo power
[3:59:48] <Treasure_Vault> @luftraumm1 Not until Pat plays a good game, like Red Dead Revolver
[3:59:50] <%luftraumm1> @PatStaresAt look at map
[4:00:01] <%Dakuu75> Boy, I sure do love it when chat runs a joke into the ground, then keeps digging~ Kappa
[4:00:08] <%luftraumm1> LuL
[4:00:10] <%abcismasta> artillery has minimum range I'm pretty sure
[4:00:36] <ElSuperNova> Y'all play Supreme Commander back in the day?
[4:00:51] <akitanito> does it not have ammo yet
[4:00:53] <%JoshManVGH> It takes time to produce
[4:01:01] <%abcismasta> also storage
[4:01:09] <%JoshManVGH> It's literally a factory
[4:01:11] <%tusk102> @PatStaresAt ammo is being produced
[4:01:18] <%abcismasta> it comes out in batches
[4:02:26] <azure_dunes> doing a wall to wall pull rn
[4:02:35] <%JoshManVGH> Like hurding catlizards
[4:02:37] <Explodincatz> they sound like Turkeys
[4:02:57] <%JoshManVGH> Rocket towers FUCK
[4:03:16] <%DashXero> But they destroyed that shit REALLY good.
[4:03:17] <Pookiedaexzile> Hope nothing happens to all these Red Bars
[4:03:21] <%Dakuu75> Blood for the blood gods. Skulls for the skull throne.
[4:03:29] <akitanito> the arty towers wasted ammo from shooting the same things
[4:03:35] <Treasure_Vault> that was neat
[4:03:46] <%JoshManVGH> Yep
[4:03:51] <lloyddboy> behind the gun towers?
[4:04:04] <Treasure_Vault> build bastions at your wall corners
[4:04:05] <+DragonArt07> I already miss the beard
[4:04:07] <%tusk102> less about volume of fire more about strategic positioning
[4:04:14] <%StephanieSadGirl> oh god full screen flesh egg daddy...
