[0:01:47] <%SuckerPunchSyd> Phrasing
[0:01:50] <%athuramn> you'd be bad for a hentai, or perfect?
[0:01:53] <%SaiyanShoto> Wow walking in on Pat saying his mouth and throat are tough is.... Yeah
[0:01:57] <ashenjuan25> I’m convinced meth dad Nier was made more anime cuz Taro was salty people called him Nier and didn’t like Bishe Nier
[0:02:01] <NatsuRedDGamer> throat and mouth you say.....
[0:02:09] <NeonBleu> Run in more ways then one

[0:04:17] <%SaiyanShoto> Still as spoilery as the original LUL
[0:04:18] <%grimm_hatter> but it's so big
[0:04:20] <Djinnazz> Yeah you might wanna skip that.
[0:04:22] <%hoodedlefty> oh look it's Wendy and Number 6
[0:04:25] <SlimeSlimeSlime> But Emile though!
[0:04:28] <DanThePumpkinman> oh no i looked at it!!!
[0:04:38] <%Alazull> Owne
[0:04:44] <shieldecho> I've spent the day farming for rare items for later; why are meteorites easier to collect than Eagle Eggs
[0:04:45] <%SaiyanShoto> I have the script of the game and looked it up so fast to see that LUL LUL
[0:04:48] <%ironohki> Near A Tomato.
[0:04:48] <%AzureGale> There's a character in Granblue Fantasy named Nier
[0:04:49] <soflicar> yep
[0:04:50] <SlimeSlimeSlime> Wait, so what's his name?
[0:04:51] <+Kindan55> I spite named him, even though I love Taro
[0:04:51] <%BoxNavy> oh dude his name is 100% nier
[0:04:51] <nevan_44> lmao
[0:04:52] <DanThePumpkinman> get owned yoko taro
[0:04:53] <%athuramn> poor taro

[0:04:54] <%valriot> Emils voice actress called him Nier in an official video LUL LUL
[0:05:02] <%luckyturtelle> It was the first thing I checked when I got mine lol
[0:05:03] <Nupinoop296> its all in the mind
[0:05:03] <kingmemelord97> ah yes nier featuring nier
[0:05:05] <soflicar> in a cutscene in this game he is refered to as nier as well
[0:05:06] <%SilvaChariot0133> @SlimeSlimeSlime Nier Kappa
[0:05:07] <%Jaxnos> i swear i've seen Yonah's journal entry say NieR in spots in my playthrough, even though i named him Jax
[0:05:08] <%IncredibleMeh> boy i sure hope someone got fired for that blunder
[0:05:10] <detectivsparkls> I have the script and screamed when I saw the  name
[0:05:11] <+D00msDayDan> everyone else working on the game was like "well what do you FUCKING want to call him then!?"
[0:05:17] <Ipsenscastle> NieR with a capital R, the R is important
[0:05:19] <thelonechris> What the fuck is even a Nier?
[0:05:19] <%logoth_> The guy from Killzone is just called Killzone
[0:05:22] <%hoodedlefty> wait, is it listed as Nier or NieR
[0:05:23] <AmericanaRed> MR NIER shibuy4Uzaki
[0:05:23] <%maskofmichael> Maybe Toro is using reverse psychology with the Nier name?
[0:05:26] <SlimeSlimeSlime> @SilvaChariot0133 You got me there.
[0:05:28] <%BoxNavy> monkaS N2
[0:05:33] <vapidq> N for Not Nier Pat
[0:05:35] <Calek> are N and N2 Bro and Papa Nier
[0:05:35] <%elhafnero> was that a dog
[0:05:39] <+BIumen> N2 is the red girls tho aint it
[0:05:44] <+NoWayRyanTatum> he introduces himself as Nier in the Forest of Myth too
[0:05:44] <%SilvaChariot0133> SourPls
[0:05:45] <%AzureGale> Crossover with N and Nier when
[0:05:57] <%BoxNavy> SourPls
[0:05:58] <+FingaLights> its all in the mind
[0:05:58] <$Sphincter_Spelunker> I swear they better make a pun called N E 1
[0:05:58] <%Monkeyweed21> his name is Napstablook
[0:05:59] <aeonicvector> So the characters name is ier, and they prefix them as N1 and N2 HahaThink
[0:05:59] <%chance_h> Sans Undertale & John Halo
[0:05:59] <%hoodedlefty> N2 is the Red Girls though, prolly for Network 2
[0:06:06] <LordOfThePoultry> SourPls
[0:06:09] <AtisutoCurry> SAM NEIL I FUCKEN HEAR YOU
[0:06:09] <AoiRob> oh nooooooo
[0:06:11] <%AzureGale> What if N let you unlock Nier in place of a niinja
[0:06:13] <zenith0111> Weissy~~~
[0:06:13] <%GalacticaPhanto> guaranteed drop in this sidequest
[0:06:13] <SlimeSlimeSlime> The last time a barmaid asked me for a "sidejob", it was a good time.
[0:06:13] <shieldecho> So I got it first try and I don't know if it goes easier on oyu for the sidequest or not
[0:06:14] <Nupinoop296> is she flirting with the book
[0:06:25] <%GalacticaPhanto> This is the one you never finish
[0:06:26] <%YakumoYomi> @Monkeyweed21 I like the cut of your jib.
[0:06:27] <%Alazull> No
[0:06:29] <Djinnazz> yeah
[0:06:30] <%Alazull> Well, yes
[0:06:31] <%SilvaChariot0133> Nyes?
[0:06:35] <%JoshManVGH> I g
[0:06:36] <pixelkenj> Yeah
[0:06:36] <%Treuan> I would flirt with the book if I could
[0:06:37] <%SaiyanShoto> Oh fuck is it? I turned in the egg
[0:06:37] <+Kharinite> Question: do you have to do side quests to unlock weapons or do you just fine them elsewhere in the game?
[0:06:37] <kingmemelord97> wait so their just fine with the talking book ?
[0:06:38] <%Alazull> But you should finish it
[0:06:39] <%BoxNavy> you get one for free so yeah
[0:06:39] <+D00msDayDan> i'd flirt with a book if it sounded that sexy too
[0:06:39] <@SSaryn> I mean, you can farm them rather easily it's just annoying.
[0:06:39] <%AzureGale> I always wanted to fuck a book
[0:06:41] <%superc37> @patstaresat i believe the reason why its still called nier is bc nier means curse; replicant being the curse of the replicants and automata being the curse of the robutts
[0:06:42] <%ssjklyco> Eagle egg respawns now
[0:06:44] <%Arkfyre> I dunno if i just got really lucky, but i went back to the aerie after and got another eagle egg
[0:06:44] <%athuramn> nice
[0:06:47] <shieldecho> @PatStaresAt YOU NEED A TOTAL OF THREE FOR THREE DIFFERENT WEAPONS
[0:06:48] <%Garthunox> its easy to get an eagle egg
[0:06:50] <%SuckerPunchSyd> Is that book voiced by Liam O’Brien?
[0:06:51] <pixelkenj> I farmed two spare eagle eggs and decide I was done for the rest of my playthrough
[0:06:55] <%Lion_kun> Just get 2 more eagle eggs
[0:06:56] <NeonBleu> Why would you keep the eagle egg?
[0:07:00] <AoiRob> i think the DLC dungeon drops the eggs
[0:07:01] <%Monkeyweed21> @PatStaresAt there is a quest in the librarby
[0:07:03] <PunishedMercer_> "easy"
[0:07:03] <thelonechris> It's really jarring seeing this when your only experience with this series was Automata
[0:07:04] <Nupinoop296> i love this song so much...
[0:07:05] <%AzureGale> @SuckerPunchSyd Yes
[0:07:11] <%Alazull> @Kharinite There's side quests, weapon shops and sometimes you find them lying around
[0:07:11] <Djinnazz> You don't have to, they respawn now.
[0:07:14] <%BoxNavy> P L E A S E DONT
[0:07:14] <%Dakuu75> LOL
[0:07:17] <%SuckerPunchSyd> @azuregale damn noice
[0:07:17] <zenith0111> DLC Dungeons still drop items ye
[0:07:22] <pixelkenj> He wont sell it :)
[0:07:25] <Laecerelius> DON'T SELL THAT SHIT, BRO
[0:07:41] <pixelkenj> Not selling, just gonna mash it into a weapon
[0:07:48] <%valriot> Quests give you so much gold LUL im at Ending D and i have 500k gold LUL
[0:07:49] <%rottingpastry> can't you just like...camp at the entrance to the aerie and keep reloading over and over to get the egg?
[0:07:53] <%SilvaChariot0133> This one plays REALLY good
[0:07:59] <%rottingpastry> much more viable when you have SSD load speeds
[0:08:02] <T_Sasquatch> Maybe i forgot but you don't have to do most sidequests right ?
[0:08:06] <zenith0111> Magic is op
[0:08:08] <pixelkenj> @rottingpastry You can, its just really tedious and grindy
[0:08:11] <%SaiyanShoto> Automata has platinum combat and booty
[0:08:11] <Djinnazz> Beepy?
[0:08:11] <AtisutoCurry> yeah  but 2booty tho
[0:08:11] <Tracazoid> They're both pretty equal in my eyes, might as well toss a coin for which one I like more
[0:08:11] <Manwad> but the sad robot tho
[0:08:19] <vapidq> I don't play Nier for the gameplay, so I have to say replicant is better for me
[0:08:20] <+JustToWatch> I just thought of a terrible PC mod where all of Emil's post skeleton voice lines are replaced with Sans noises
[0:08:20] <$Sphincter_Spelunker> it whistles too
[0:08:20] <%Alazull> She do got dat ass tho
[0:08:23] <%valriot> Noooo, Automata is way better, the NON story shit in this, is fetch quest hell still, and Endings are repetative
[0:08:23] <LordOfThePoultry> robot ass is very tempting
[0:08:24] <%Monkeyweed21> 2nd floor lady has a quest
[0:08:24] <rekinom> Android booty got me acting wild
[0:08:26] <%ssjklyco> There's no more fog that was in the PS3
[0:08:26] <AmericanaRed> THICBOT shibuy4Kirby2
[0:08:28] <%Lion_kun> I think Nier has better characters and story
[0:08:28] <SlimeSlimeSlime> The watchers were always watching... Dat Ass.
[0:08:29] <pixelkenj> 2nd floor
[0:08:31] <%Dakuu75> @PatStaresAt is there something you like more about this game than automata?
[0:08:33] <shieldecho> Second floor
[0:08:35] <+Kindan55> they're of the same tier now
[0:08:35] <T_Sasquatch> Tbh i find most of the early game not great.  I started to enjoy it when i got to the desert
[0:08:36] <%rottingpastry> I got 2 by accident because I kept breaking the fragile package lol
[0:08:38] <%Monkeyweed21> @PatStaresAt 2nd floor
[0:08:46] <+Leftovermemes> upstairs
[0:08:50] <ItsPastas> with replicant the choice is pretty much personal preference now, they're both really good games
[0:08:51] <%superc37> kaine
[0:08:56] <%SilvaChariot0133> Unironically rather enjoy the busted gamespeed at high framerate
[0:08:56] <+Kindan55> I do think Emil and Kaine are stronger characters than the androids though.
[0:08:57] <+D00msDayDan> i like being able to block
[0:08:59] <thelonechris> I just like all the clean sci-fi robot tech and shit
[0:08:59] <shieldecho> @rottingpastry Nice
[0:09:03] <Ipsenscastle> This game is much more human than Automata for obvious reasons
[0:09:06] <%Treuan> Kaine is rad
[0:09:06] <peyodogo> the cast rocks
[0:09:08] <%BoxNavy> nierly
[0:09:08] <%superc37> kaine outclasses everything in automata
[0:09:12] <%AzureGale> Why is that lady wearing a swimsuit
[0:09:14] <SlimeSlimeSlime> Nierly.
[0:09:17] <iosephe> And the pods
[0:09:17] <bahamut1010> Pascal?
[0:09:18] <TheNix> Pascal
[0:09:20] <zenith0111> 9S is main character tho
[0:09:22] <shieldecho> Technically you need four total eagle eggs if you WANT to do that sidequest as well
[0:09:23] <%Monkeyweed21> Pascal tho
[0:09:26] <Foven1> A2 is barely there too
[0:09:29] <%MelBrooksKA> Jackass
[0:09:30] <$Sphincter_Spelunker> you bitch, how dare
[0:09:30] <%BoxNavy> PASCAL IS SO GOOOOOD
[0:09:32] <+ArtsyFoxo> Pascal is soooo good
[0:09:32] <%Treuan> Pascal :(
[0:09:33] <+Kindan55> and the pods
[0:09:34] <%Monkeyweed21> Pascal and the twins
[0:09:35] <pixelkenj> I like how the characters bond with each other in Gestalt by yelling at each other
[0:09:36] <$Sphincter_Spelunker> fake fan
[0:09:39] <%Monkeyweed21> Jackass too
[0:09:40] <tanarath> BALLS EXPOSED
[0:09:40] <%Wallabri> PASCAL RULES
[0:09:40] <%Alazull> Yeah but it's like after Ending B it's just Pascal
[0:09:40] <shieldecho> I love Pascal
[0:09:42] <%logoth_> Devo and popo are there too
[0:09:42] <%Garthunox> PASCAL IS AMAZING
[0:09:44] <T_Sasquatch> A2 is kaine lite. Let's be real
[0:09:47] <AmericanaRed> MAKE THEM ONE GAME shibuy4Gendo
[0:09:50] <+Kindan55> Pods
[0:09:51] <bahamut1010> FATHER SERVO
[0:09:55] <%rottingpastry> let's get these shithogs!
[0:09:56] <zenith0111> A2 story was definitely skimmed on
[0:09:58] <pixelkenj> Weiss deepening friendships by  calling Kaine Hussy is great
[0:10:01] <Tracazoid> Yeah Devola and Popola are better in this one, Pascal is fantastic though. Popola's actress killed it in Gestalt.
[0:10:01] <TheNix> There's like the operators but they aren't that big a deal
[0:10:03] <olm46> A2 is inferior inferior Kaine. Sadly.
[0:10:04] <Djinnazz> Map
[0:10:08] <%BoxNavy> monkaS
[0:10:10] <%valriot> Theyre both incredible, but Automata is a WAY better videogame, the quests and backtracking in this, are agonising
[0:10:13] <%hoodedlefty> okay but the twins have a better design in Automata but they get more time to shine in Replicant
[0:10:16] <AoiRob> A2 is a Lacroix version of Kaine tbh
[0:10:22] <+ArtsyFoxo> A2 lmao. I only got her lore from the Book "Short Story Long". A2 is so rad and I WISH her story was in Automata
[0:10:23] <Baddict> that alphinaud?
[0:10:25] <%the38bandit> the robot with all the girls chasing him is pretty good too
[0:10:32] <%BoxNavy> i hope pat doesnt forget to get all the weapons in part 1
[0:10:35] <%dkzk21> This game has a better story and cast but mostly kinda generic sidequests.
[0:10:35] <%rottingpastry> lol just run around the perimeter until you see the arrow
[0:10:35] <%athuramn> hold up, did it just censor popo @logoth_
[0:10:37] <%superc37> hall wug
[0:10:42] <Djinnazz> by the stairs
[0:10:42] <Laecerelius> I found the Operator who was obsessed with the concept of family interesting.
[0:10:44] <pixelkenj> Just rub against all the bookcases
[0:10:48] <%SaiyanShoto> I just walk against the bookshelves and it tells me
[0:10:50] <danknugglit> Dig up stupid
[0:10:56] <%BoxNavy> nice
[0:10:59] <zenith0111> @valriot Ye Yoko Taro has said how he did a lot of things to mess with people. Like an asshole lol
[0:11:05] <%rottingpastry> what weapons can you miss in part 1?
[0:11:10] <+ShutUpAceyP> where's ugly Nioh?
[0:11:11] <%AzureGale> Make sure you avoid small holes when you fuck walls...
[0:11:12] <%rottingpastry> I mean, that you can't get later
[0:11:15] <%Garthunox> all the weapons in part 1 can be gotten in part 2
[0:11:28] <drawertogether> I think you can eventually buy all part 1 weapons
[0:11:28] <%dkzk21> Automata story and characters arent as good as this one but funny enough allvthe sidequests are great at world building and supporting the themes of the game.
[0:11:30] <T_Sasquatch> Realistically im sure you cant fuck anything up
[0:11:31] <thelonechris> I just realized the book is fucking talking
[0:11:32] <%IncredibleMeh> what if they had decided to make the western release of Automata with a big daddy-android 9S?
[0:11:33] <Tracazoid> "We don't got no dewey decimal system, just throw that on this bookshelf."
[0:11:41] <zenith0111> @valriot Even mentioned how he tried to fill it with pointless fetch quests
[0:11:42] <%Dakuu75> If someone gave me instructions like that Npc did. I'd be like, "oh-hell-no, write down for me please."
[0:11:44] <%valriot> THEY STILL DO
[0:11:46] <%rottingpastry> I really don't look forward to the flower fucking
[0:11:51] <shieldecho> Oh they will continue to suck tons of shit
[0:11:58] <tattleworm> pretty sure these were voice acted too apart from the npc
[0:11:59] <+Kindan55> Did you see they fixed a big in XIV where Paradigms Breach was crashing the game? LUL LUL
[0:12:00] <AtisutoCurry> FUCKEN LIAM OBRIAN I RECOGNIZE THAT VOICE
[0:12:01] <%valriot> Theyre really bad still LUL
[0:12:02] <%BoxNavy> they are still miserable moon2W
[0:12:02] <ItsPastas> but they're still real bad
[0:12:04] <T_Sasquatch> You're gonna get endings regardless . Can't just break the game
[0:12:07] <+ShutUpAceyP> i don't like this young nioh's voice...
[0:12:08] <+kullumanati> Is PSN up?
[0:12:09] <shieldecho> Spent literally the past two days doing sidequests and farming for itmes
[0:12:09] <rekinom> nooooooooooo
[0:12:14] <+Kindan55> bug*
[0:12:16] <thelonechris> "So I did some grinding off stream..."
[0:12:17] <%ssjklyco> Like , the NPC's weren'tt even voice acted in the original.
[0:12:18] <%solracc25> It means you can't book
[0:12:18] <%athuramn> RIGHT, voice acting makes so many things better (looking at you disco)
[0:12:19] <$Futurecity10> @PatStaresAt I literalyl completed every single quest but one yesterday and fuck me the grinding sucks
[0:12:27] <%AzureGale> can you let her keep the money so she can afford some pants
[0:12:30] <%bread_assassin> I don't know. Even voice acting can't help "go put books on shelves."
[0:12:31] <Djinnazz> Yeah, they're mostly just material fetch quests.
[0:12:32] <%Dakuu75> can't believe she paid you, to put away two books
[0:12:44] <+ShutUpAceyP> pants are not necessary for success
[0:12:45] <+Kindan55> Fishimg quests on stream COWARD
[0:12:46] <Djinnazz> @Futurecity10 The pink seeds thing?
[0:12:46] <%Dakuu75> LMAO
[0:12:56] <AmericanaRed> DUMBASS shibuy4Piccolo
[0:12:56] <%ssjklyco> Forgot papa Nier also called Devola an idiot .
[0:12:56] <Nupinoop296> good hourly pay
[0:12:57] <%BoxNavy> 500 gold = 500 USD
[0:12:57] <%rottingpastry> at least the side stuff in part 1 is mostly, "use your money to buy the things you need and get rewarded half of what you spent."
[0:12:58] <$Futurecity10> yes
[0:12:59] <%dkzk21> the sidequests here are worth it though for the banter.
[0:13:02] <zenith0111> Thats like 5 herbs pog
[0:13:05] <%Dakuu75> this economy bust be booming
[0:13:05] <Tracazoid> Librarians get paid well in this world it seems
[0:13:06] <Sturmley> Shit like that is why the economy is fucked in this game, Pat
[0:13:07] <T_Sasquatch> Inflation in the apocalypse
[0:13:08] <pixelkenj> its Not as bad as Cloud asking for 2000 gil to do terrorism
[0:13:08] <Djinnazz> yeah
[0:13:08] <HeroToxiko> ye
[0:13:08] <shieldecho> She probably knows you and your sister are hurting for cash and is being super nice, I love the people in this village
[0:13:11] <%Garthunox> a watermelon is 1200 gold tho
[0:13:11] <maskedmook> no
[0:13:13] <%rottingpastry> I don't think you could trigger the run with a roll?
[0:13:14] <zenith0111> Papa Nier just had weighty animations
[0:13:15] <%TheLemuroid> The running is new
[0:13:18] <$Futurecity10> currently breeding for orange seeds
[0:13:18] <%athuramn> yeah, it just looked worse
[0:13:23] <%Dakuu75> LOL
[0:13:23] <%bigboyeggo> PAT NO
[0:13:24] <%thelaxinator> it's yen, dude
[0:13:27] <%Alazull> cheer500 So Pat I was wondering, what do you think Taro will do next? Personally after seeing the Drakengard references in the FF14 raid, I have a feeling we might be getting another of those games.
[0:13:27] <ScreamLord> @PatStaresAt Nier Gestalt was a great but janky game with a super weird and interesting story. Nier Replicant Remake is that same game with a lot of the jank removed and polished out. Automata had very little jank and better combat than Nier but quite as interesting characters.
[0:13:28] <pixelkenj> blame the mutton market
[0:13:30] <%SilvaChariot0133> Debased currency? Kappa
[0:13:31] <%king_wragles> I mean, givin extra cash to the unfortunate kid of the village seems like a nice thing to do
[0:13:31] <%CalderGaming> watermelons are expensive in japan maybe
[0:13:31] <thelonechris> Deviantart
[0:13:32] <HeroToxiko> late late stage capitalism LUL
[0:13:32] <%rottingpastry> watermelon is uhhhh 800?
[0:13:32] <rekinom> prices are made up because none of this matter
[0:13:32] <AmericanaRed> MARKET CRASH
[0:13:33] <%valriot> You get SHIT TONS of money
[0:13:36] <%Garthunox> ITS THE APOCALYPSE PAT!
[0:13:36] <zenith0111> Youll be selling fish for 3.5k later
[0:13:37] <AoiRob> Papa NieR just runs like he's got a stick up his ass
[0:13:37] <%rottingpastry> I may have just done that quest
[0:13:42] <Daxalog> Gold aint worth shit in the apocalpyse
[0:13:42] <%SaiyanShoto> It goes away sometimes for me
[0:13:42] <%goose_attack_almanac> it's been 10 years Pat
[0:13:43] <%BoxNavy> monkaS
[0:13:47] <+Leftovermemes> time of day
[0:13:47] <%AzureGale> Capitalism, ho!
[0:13:48] <+Kindan55> Apocalypse stock market is wild
[0:13:49] <tattleworm> he doesn't always show up
[0:13:52] <%thelaxinator> Also I'm pretty sure these dudes and dudettes are paying you above average as charity because of Yonah
[0:13:53] <AmericanaRed> GME STILL STRONG THO shibuy4Piccolo
[0:13:54] <robert_orri> pat the human race is on the brink, hyperinflation is normal
[0:13:57] <%Cn_alpha_02> Bright sun
[0:13:58] <tattleworm> especially when this is happening
[0:13:59] <Fefe41> Appears on cloudy days
[0:14:01] <pixelkenj> Probably because of that story event
[0:14:02] <%Alazull> @PatStaresAt They mention food shortages, and besides it's all play money anyway
[0:14:04] <%BoxNavy> KILL
[0:14:05] <%SilvaChariot0133> SourPls
[0:14:07] <%Garthunox> Its sunny weather
[0:14:09] <Nupinoop296> BIG PUNCH
[0:14:13] <%athuramn> I like to look at og nier as a beautiful art piece made of garbage
[0:14:13] <%Dakuu75> I always think of that moment in history when Russia over printed their money. Then had ppl pulling wheel barrels full of paper money to buy a piece of bread.
[0:14:13] <%valriot> Im about to get Ending D and i have 500k gold and nothing to spend it lmfao money is trivial
[0:14:16] <zenith0111> FOR YONAH
[0:14:17] <LordOfThePoultry> hey its yuri
[0:14:26] <%The_Gaming_Karp> Kill them all in self-defense!
[0:14:26] <olm46> Would you truly leave him to die x6
[0:14:29] <Rixstarian> @patstaresat You can use B to insta-execute downed enemies

[0:14:48] <%sporeian94> Can you buy acheviements in this one too?
[0:14:50] <%SilvaChariot0133> and Summon Swords

[0:14:57] <%SilvaChariot0133> always Summon Swords
[0:14:57] <stormhawk9891> Looks cool tho
[0:15:00] <AoiRob> Dark Wall is *GREAT* for Fragile Delivery
[0:15:04] <LordOfThePoultry> looks cool though
[0:15:08] <%Ynkubus_> Sell it :)
[0:15:10] <boardscanada> beastbain is OP in kid nier run
[0:15:13] <Laecerelius> Yours is upgraded, though
[0:15:18] <zenith0111> The lighter weapons will have lower attack power but fast attack speed
[0:15:20] <$Futurecity10> faith is the best part 1 sword
[0:15:21] <cardamomo88> hellos gang
[0:15:27] <%ssjklyco> Use Best words
[0:15:29] <shieldecho> @sporeian94 Hope so, there's a few I just don't wanna do
[0:15:33] <%cvp5127> pat use equip best word
[0:15:33] <LordOfThePoultry> pahamah?
[0:15:33] <%BoxNavy> Paha
[0:15:34] <pixelkenj> The YorHa swords are grossly OP for Act 1 when upgraded
[0:15:35] <%The_Gaming_Karp> Pargon?
[0:15:36] <tattleworm> @PatStaresAt if you select the name of the weapon you can batch apply
[0:15:38] <%rottingpastry> pahamahbahdah
[0:15:38] <Laecerelius> Paha it up bro
[0:15:41] <Dwarven_Gaming> click the name to auto set the best, uaully thats drop rate
[0:15:41] <%BoxNavy> the Pa and the MA
[0:15:42] <+Kindan55> Beastbain is kinda broken, especially since the weights don't seem to mean much.
[0:15:42] <%athuramn> paha mah!
[0:15:43] <%SilvaChariot0133> Cruel Oath kinda busted
[0:15:45] <%StewTheGreat> you can batch assign the words
[0:15:45] <%Alazull> Yeah for some fights I would rather have Dark Wall than block
[0:15:51] <+Leftovermemes> i totally forgot faith on young nier, i gotta wait till ng+
[0:15:51] <Nupinoop296> Pah, Pahra, Pahraga
[0:15:52] <%Garthunox> @PatStaresAt click on the name of the weapon in the words menu
[0:15:54] <Djinnazz> @PatStaresAt You down load the Automata addon stuff?
[0:15:57] <%Monkeyweed21> no upgrades
[0:16:01] <%Tenkay> If you click the sword name it gives you an option to use  the best words btw
[0:16:01] <%rottingpastry> hoooow
[0:16:02] <%StewTheGreat> select the weapon name in the word menu
[0:16:03] <pixelkenj> Word Edit > Dont select All
[0:16:05] <zenith0111> Magic Power matter too woth the swords
[0:16:12] <tattleworm> @PatStaresAt select the name of the weapon instead of the first or second slot
[0:16:17] <pixelkenj> you cant do it in ALL
[0:16:24] <zenith0111> Pat Vs Words
[0:16:32] <%BoxNavy> yo what?
[0:16:32] <%bevyrage> weapons section of the word menu pat
[0:16:33] <%StewTheGreat> to do batch you have to be in the sub menu
[0:16:37] <%Jaxnos> he's gotten there
[0:16:39] <%StewTheGreat> for weapons or whatever
[0:16:39] <+Kindan55> Pat...
[0:16:41] <zenith0111> IT DOESNT
[0:16:42] <Laecerelius> HOW CAN THIS BEEEEEE?!
[0:16:42] <%SilvaChariot0133> Biggest number?
[0:16:42] <Daniel_Is_I> Oh that would have been helpful to know.
[0:16:42] <tattleworm> it doesn't really
[0:16:43] <%The_Gaming_Karp> It has the best words!
[0:16:43] <+JustToWatch> IT JUST DOES
[0:16:46] <+forgetme000> with math
[0:16:47] <Dwarven_Gaming> usually its drop rate is priority
[0:16:47] <Visorak6> It's clearly using some deepmind government AI
[0:16:50] <%Garthunox> the %
[0:16:51] <danknugglit> Videogames
[0:16:52] <%miguelrod777> magic
[0:16:52] <tattleworm> if you're gonna do status attacks, you gotta manually pick that stuff
[0:16:52] <pixelkenj> whatever is biggest numbers
[0:16:53] <%BoxNavy> how does it know....
[0:16:56] <+Kindan55> Was that always there?
[0:16:58] <%Dakuu75> Magic
[0:16:59] <iosephe> obviously, just the best
[0:17:00] <+D00msDayDan> batch assign only works for weapons not spells
[0:17:01] <AmericanaRed> shibuy4Ryuk best words
[0:17:01] <JetpackMcQuack> LUL
[0:17:02] <maskedmook> it picks it by %
[0:17:03] <%bevyrage> it doesn't know what's best, but it'll look at %'s and go from there
[0:17:03] <%athuramn> in a low hush of whisper "get out of town"
[0:17:09] <tattleworm> this was in the original too
[0:17:09] <Tracazoid> It knows power and grinding for items(because weapon upgrads) are what everyone wants
[0:17:12] <%Chester_goes_Berserk> advanced machine learning
[0:17:16] <danknugglit> HOW CAN THIS BE
[0:17:16] <tattleworm> batch assign is new though
[0:17:17] <pixelkenj> You have to open Magic or Weapons tab to get batch assign, not the All Category
[0:17:19] <+chiazam> What about weapon stories?
[0:17:19] <T_Sasquatch> Wait WTF.  I didn't know that was a THING
[0:17:24] <+Kindan55> @athuramn No wonder Paige left BibleThump BibleThump
[0:17:29] <T_Sasquatch> I've been doing it manually ahhhh

[0:17:58] <maskedmook> open a weapon
[0:17:58] <pixelkenj> then its under the Best Words
[0:18:00] <tattleworm> THEN select the weapon name
[0:18:00] <+D00msDayDan> how can this BE
[0:18:00] <LordOfThePoultry> choose all
[0:18:01] <%solracc25> psaBig word = psaBig number
[0:18:01] <karovus> isnt is weird how you have to be in the word tab to assign words?
[0:18:02] <%BoxNavy> moon2W whats happening

[0:18:56] <%bigboyeggo> WAIT YOU COULD DO THAT THE WHOLE TIME
[0:18:59] <%rottingpastry> that's the most useful thing in the world
[0:19:02] <tattleworm> because magic/weapons/martial have different words
[0:19:03] <T_Sasquatch> Why doesn't this tell youuuuu
[0:19:05] <Laecerelius> That's kind of an odd place for that to be
[0:19:05] <%athuramn> BECAUZE IT INTUITIVE
[0:19:07] <Dwarven_Gaming> there are soem that dont work on magic and guard
[0:19:13] <%Jaxnos> because there are words that don't apply to magic or martial arts, pat
[0:19:15] <Dwarven_Gaming> not allw ords work on all types
[0:19:15] <Djinnazz> no it's not.
[0:19:16] <%BoxNavy> DansGame !!!
[0:19:16] <%Garthunox> because some words are magic or weapon specific
[0:19:16] <+D00msDayDan> just intuit it pat
[0:19:23] <%Ozavic> Did I miss anything important in the last 20 minutes?
[0:19:27] <%bigboyeggo> I GOT THE TRUE ENDING AND NEVER KNEW YOU COULD DO THAT WTF
[0:19:30] <AoiRob> because some words have different effects between magic and weapons
[0:19:30] <stormhawk9891> SPOODER
[0:19:35] <%TheLemuroid> I have to try that now
[0:19:35] <+JustToWatch> remember you have a knock dwon kill
[0:19:35] <zenith0111> @t_sasquatch All tutorials are drops that you can potentially misss :P Yoko Taro is a dick
[0:19:44] <%Wallabri> wow... what a mansion

[0:19:55] <soflicar> lol in the RE house there are giant spiders
[0:19:59] <cardamomo88> aha
[0:20:01] <%rottingpastry> don't forget to kill the right scorpion to get fishing tip 2!
[0:20:07] <pixelkenj> Thats like... a single NPC

[0:20:40] <cardamomo88> Kappa
[0:20:40] <Laecerelius> Kill them all, Pat.  Kill them all and get the words
[0:20:41] <%AzureGale> Mortal Kombat Scorpion?
[0:20:56] <zenith0111> The main reason besides drops and exp to battle enemies is to get words
[0:20:56] <+D00msDayDan> you get fishing tip 2 from killing some scorpion in the desert, there's a lot of jank that didn't get ironed out
[0:21:00] <%Garthunox> I slept on it, and i regret it

[0:21:41] <%The_Gaming_Karp> Do we even have maritime shipping?
[0:21:42] <%Monkeyweed21> Dark Gluttony lets you absorb magic attacks to restore MP, against bullet spammers its infinite MP
[0:21:43] <Daniel_Is_I> Lighthouses work in fog too
[0:21:43] <%BoxNavy> shes old and senile pat jermaPluto

[0:21:49] <%maskofmichael> Paige is at the lighthouse again
[0:21:51] <zenith0111> They tried to protect the old lady is thats "bad"
[0:21:51] <%Garthunox> Is that Linda Lominsa?
[0:21:54] <+Meta1spy51> what is that stair gap
[0:21:57] <+Kindan55> I keep hearing that, but I thought this quest shows they're misguided but alright at heart.
[0:22:01] <%rottingpastry> so this world is like 120 degrees F at all times, right?
[0:22:04] <Blank9> you can also absorb magic attacks by just slashing magic orbs
[0:22:06] <lemon_lover28> yeah, weird to focus a big sidequest on a lighthouse in this setting
[0:22:08] <%ssjklyco> I've not seen Dusk in this version.

[0:22:42] <Nupinoop296> i know that voice
[0:22:43] <Blank9> this is where brother nier went to prostitute himself
[0:22:44] <pixelkenj> ???
[0:22:44] <+The_Gaming_Karp> that's an odd thing to say
[0:22:50] <%rottingpastry> "All the bitches in this town are ugly."
[0:22:50] <%solracc25> women can teleport
[0:22:51] <T_Sasquatch> Weird
[0:22:52] <zenith0111> Ladies are a flirt in this town
[0:22:54] <karl_rex> Is that Yukari?
[0:22:56] <%ssjklyco> That implies people fuck fish
[0:22:56] <%Wallabri> ma'am are you ok
[0:22:56] <skyentombment> BUT THEY SMELL THE SAME EUYYYYYYY
[0:23:01] <pixelkenj> Our ladies smell like fish
[0:23:01] <Blank9> they go for young boys in this town
[0:23:05] <boardscanada> so every NPC is voiced now fully? that's a huge QoL improvement
[0:23:08] <+Kindan55> Innsmouth?
[0:23:09] <+chiazam> whoo needs women when you can have FISH
[0:23:10] <%king_wragles> Are they mean? I'm concerned about these ladies, why are they undesirable?
[0:23:11] <%rumtumtugnutz> People would rather fuck fish than women I guess
[0:23:12] <+oda_flobunaga> Ocean Women, hiding in plain sight in your local fish market
[0:23:12] <AoiRob> they fuck the fish duh
[0:23:18] <karovus> do the men in this universe prefer fish over women?
[0:23:24] <%rottingpastry> will you take the coward route?
[0:23:30] <thelonechris> Fuck you, book

[0:23:46] <pixelkenj> big man
[0:23:46] <boardscanada> with papa Nier gone Weiss becomes automatically the best character
[0:23:47] <%solracc25> spoken to 3 people...
[0:23:48] <+tactician0> guys only want one thing and it's disgusting.
[0:23:52] <+oda_flobunaga> Ocean Women: confusing lesbians till the end of time
[0:23:55] <%SilvaChariot0133> "You don't pay my sub book!"
[0:24:02] <%rottingpastry> baby Nier is fine
[0:24:13] <%solracc25> "dammit super powerful book, heal my sister"
[0:24:15] <AoiRob> i wonder what goes down in the dark side of the planet...
[0:24:16] <pixelkenj> great hiding spot??
[0:24:18] <%bigboyeggo> why does she sound like that
[0:24:19] <%BoxNavy> i mean, they havent found him yet
[0:24:24] <karovus> kid i dont think anyone is looking for you
[0:24:26] <T_Sasquatch> I don't think anyone wants to find you bro
[0:24:27] <Visorak6> God I swear that's Okino
[0:24:28] <%LouieRouie> What about the kid who can't find him?
[0:24:28] <%The_Gaming_Karp> I want fruit
[0:24:29] <+tactician0> I'm looking for fish
[0:24:42] <%bigboyeggo> @AoiRob canonically it's a lot of child prostitution
[0:24:47] <%rottingpastry> lol
[0:24:50] <pixelkenj> amazing suggestion
[0:24:54] <lemon_lover28> I like Papa Nier for the daughter father relationship but also think that he looks god awful
[0:24:56] <%solracc25> no way, they sell fish at the fish shop?
[0:24:56] <cardamomo88> women fear me fish love me
[0:24:59] <%rottingpastry> "Maybe ask a fishmonger, dumbass, I sell potions."
[0:25:00] <%NitronStreams> Give mackerel
[0:25:02] <%bigboyeggo> oh wait you meant the LITERAL dark side
[0:25:02] <+Kindan55> So the stream is gonna stop at this quest right? that's what my favourite journos did?
[0:25:04] <boardscanada> I will say that I am very grateful Kid Nier doesn't sound like your typical anime kid, I was afraid for the worst but thankfully we were spared
[0:25:07] <zenith0111> You need to fish it yourself
[0:25:10] <LordOfThePoultry> more weapons PogChamp

[0:27:16] <shieldecho> I fucked up a lot my first few tries at fishing and two hours later I caught like seventeen sharks
[0:27:19] <%Wallabri> Poor Justin McElroy, your bad Nier review will live in infamy forever

[0:28:22] <%Uselesswhitenoise> Mr evrart is helping me find my cock carousal
[0:28:29] <%The_Gaming_Karp> I know how to fish Weiss, jeez
[0:28:31] <%rottingpastry> wait until your pole bends then you know it's time to pull
[0:28:34] <%Garthunox> @PatStaresAt The controls lie, think of where the fish is like a semi-circle, only move your controller on the bottom half of the controller area, once you know this fishing is kinda decent
[0:28:35] <Ipsenscastle> Joystiq used to be the best gaming blog on the whole, I miss it
[0:28:37] <zenith0111> Learning Bob Patterns NotLikeThis
[0:28:38] <pixelkenj> it took me some time to understand the controls

[0:28:45] <Parapattern> @king_wragles Justin
[0:28:47] <%AzureGale> Gotta THRUST
[0:28:47] <+oda_flobunaga> The thing about dumb reviewers is that they help stupid ppl stay away from things too hard for them, they provide a service
[0:28:49] <+D00msDayDan> there are a couple of fish you have to reel on the first nibble, game doesn't tell you though
[0:28:50] <T_Sasquatch> Sometimes the fish don't fucking bite. Sometimes the move so fast you can't even react to the direction
[0:28:53] <cardamomo88> YOU CAN SEE THE SEAL IN THE DISTANCE
[0:28:54] <Djinnazz> gotta find the sweet spot
[0:28:55] <olaksi> I've seen people criticize games for adding such unreasonable puzzles as Tower of Hanoi, nothing surprises
[0:28:58] <shieldecho> You need to pull back the entire time as well as picking a direction
[0:29:00] <%BoxNavy> you. did it.
[0:29:00] <+oda_flobunaga> Dean Takahashi for instance
[0:29:04] <%Cn_alpha_02> You can also just tilt instead of pressing O.
[0:29:12] <Visorak6> That is a tiny ass fish to go for that trouble
[0:29:12] <zenith0111> Now the town sells shaman fish since you caught it

[0:34:57] <%AzureGale> Reviewer SLAM
[0:34:59] <+D00msDayDan> did he get pissy about no checkpoints in the prologue?
[0:35:00] <%king_wragles> Justin McElroy just doesn't like RPGs
[0:35:04] <Visorak6> Yes
[0:35:04] <%BoxNavy> it does
[0:35:05] <Djinnazz> yes
[0:35:05] <%king_wragles> I think he only likes Fallout
[0:35:05] <%Axellogic> I wasnt wrecked tho
[0:35:06] <vapidq> yeah

[0:35:07] <TheHeroAppears> yeah
[0:35:07] <$Futurecity10> Yes?
[0:35:07] <HeroToxiko> yes

[0:35:09] <vapidq> barely
[0:35:09] <%psidefx> ye
[0:35:10] <+RenoDeGeneric> It did
[0:35:10] <%MisterRockett> Yes
[0:35:10] <%ssjklyco> Yeah, but not forced fishing
[0:35:11] <%rottingpastry> "I took out my OS chip and died what the fuck?"
[0:35:11] <cardamomo88> yes it have
[0:35:12] <karovus> mcelroy has a problem with a good game? no way
[0:35:12] <%Wallabri> pod fishing
[0:35:12] <%AzureGale> Yes, Autotomatoes had fishing
[0:35:13] <+Dorf1> automata was justin macelroys goty the year it came out
[0:35:16] <+D00msDayDan> i don't think there's even a voiced line that tells you to fish
[0:35:16] <%MelBrooksKA> yes
[0:35:18] <%justcallmebobplease> Did you forget dying from eating a fish, Pat?
[0:35:18] <Melchior_the_Wise> How else you get the mackral?
[0:35:19] <penitentpendant> Yeah Automata has fishing, it's how you got ending F
[0:35:20] <+ZephynM> Automata had plenty of fishing
[0:35:20] <$Afterman_> pat no monhun today?
[0:35:22] <%MisterRockett> Do you not remember eating the fish and dying?
[0:35:22] <zenith0111> IT HAD SO MANY FISH
[0:35:24] <%Jaxnos> you had to fish for a bunch of stuff in automata yeah. like the pipe weapon and the extra pod
[0:35:24] <%solracc25> I am not your father
[0:35:25] <$Futurecity10> @PatStaresAt You throw the pod into the water and fish with the pod
[0:35:26] <%AzureGale> You could get an iron pipe from fishing
[0:35:30] <Timbroome> Robo fish and all
[0:35:31] <%BoxNavy> cus you only have to do it to get the iron pipe and like maybe for a sidequest
[0:35:32] <%Dakuu75> I remember a quest where someone makes you eat a fish because fish-oil or something
[0:35:36] <%solracc25> Automata had fishing
[0:35:37] <+Kindan55> Wait, was that the same McElroy from the brothers podcasts? oh no, he kinda cool tho
[0:35:44] <%shurtal> you get the Nier Pipe from fishing in the sewers
[0:35:48] <AoiRob> well Automata's fishing isnt mandatory at any point so
[0:35:50] <peyodogo> tomato's spoof endings were fun
[0:35:52] <%za7az> @Axellogic We're just having fun mate, it's all good
[0:35:53] <zenith0111> Some fish had lore description on the world
[0:35:54] <%Uselesswhitenoise> he is the least cool of the three
[0:35:55] <Tracazoid> Ahh yes, the canon ending to Nier Automata, death by fish.
[0:35:55] <penitentpendant> Oh yeah, the weapon
[0:35:55] <%MisterRockett> WAIT THE SHITTY NIER REVIEW WAS BY JUSTIN MCELROY?!
[0:35:56] <boardscanada> nothing cool about that guy LULW
[0:35:57] <olaksi> The only time you are really encouraged to fish is getting the 3rd pod
[0:35:58] <%Dakuu75> I forgot her name was "Jackass" lol
[0:35:59] <%bigboyeggo> @Kindan55 just watched the video, the very same
[0:36:01] <%AzureGale> Game reviewers can't be cool /s
[0:36:05] <%Jeshk0> not sure if anyone else mentioned, but you can fish in nier
[0:36:09] <+chiazam> yeah this quest is a waste of time isn't it
[0:36:10] <%justcallmebobplease> @MisterRockett SURE FUCKING WAS
[0:36:12] <%Gloom_Tangerine> @patstaresat did you see the other McElroy brother mocking evo moment 37?
[0:36:13] <%BoxNavy> her name is jackass
[0:36:17] <%Dakuu75> FUCK~!!! lol
[0:36:20] <%solracc25> she dead
[0:36:22] <%MisterRockett> @MisterRockett AHHHHHHHHHHHHH
[0:36:23] <Melchior_the_Wise> is Jackass just Kaine's reincarnation?
[0:36:23] <+chaumiester> Wait... Jackass is in this game as well?
[0:36:23] <%SilvaChariot0133> Bruh
[0:36:23] <Blank9> I have no idea who it is when everyone keeps saying it's by omg this dude
[0:36:25] <%AzureGale> PUSH HER OFF THE LIGHTHOUSE
[0:36:27] <%Axellogic> I remember the little digital stol you get when you did fishing in Autotomato
[0:36:36] <%bigboyeggo> HOW CAN YOU MAKE FUN OF EVO MOMENT 37
[0:36:36] <%AzureGale> FUCK YOU LADY
[0:36:39] <%bigboyeggo> ITS SO GREAT
[0:36:40] <Visorak6> Savage
[0:36:49] <%AzureGale> WEISS WITH THE SICK BURN

[0:36:57] <iosephe> money
[0:37:01] <%Monkeyweed21> weren't you just saying the supporting cast in Automata sucked cuz you forgot Pascal and Jackass?
[0:37:04] <%MisterRockett> I never saw that I'd need to see in what context you can mock Evo moment 37.
[0:37:06] <%solracc25> this book spitting fire
[0:37:14] <+chiazam> DIALOGUE
[0:37:14] <Melchior_the_Wise> old woman pays little boy to talk shit to him
[0:37:16] <%Axellogic> "Talking book? Thats normal"
[0:37:16] <olm46> Jackass barely shows up.
[0:37:16] <zenith0111> Side Quests are very rewarding
[0:37:18] <+datmegamandeeeee> Granny low key best sidequest
[0:37:24] <%Gloom_Tangerine> @bigboyeggo Travis called it chaotic and unfun
[0:37:30] <%AzureGale> I hope Lighthouse Lady steps on the pointy end of LEGO bricks for the rest of her life
[0:37:32] <Blank9> the main cast of nier is better than automata's, but automata's isn't bad
[0:37:32] <lemon_lover28> they didn't exist until he said they sucked
[0:37:35] <boardscanada> Nier 1 definitely has the better characters - in Automata they were kinda there but not the main focus
[0:37:36] <+Dorf1> the monster hunter update is up i think, my switch is downloading something
[0:37:38] <+yukichocomilk> pascal is fucking great
[0:37:40] <penitentpendant> Birth of a Wish
[0:37:41] <%AzureGale> FATHER SERVO
[0:37:42] <Blank9> father servo
[0:37:42] <HeroToxiko> Katate man
[0:37:44] <cardamomo88> father servo??
[0:37:44] <%BoxNavy> it IS very funny that everyone is just chill with weiss
[0:37:46] <%Monkeyweed21> FATHER SERVO
[0:37:47] <Visorak6> Father Servo
[0:37:47] <peyodogo> they don't suck but they're nowhere near as integral to the plot as og nier's
[0:37:47] <HeroToxiko> i prefer theory bot
[0:37:48] <+eanscrale> The Ryu-bot was the best
[0:37:48] <tattleworm> heck yeah father servo
[0:37:49] <Melchior_the_Wise> FATHER SERVO
[0:37:49] <mike2hands> bless you
[0:37:50] <%Dementedpenguin> bless
[0:37:51] <UTaken34> bless you
[0:37:51] <%DrJamesWoods> Does the music sound kinda weird?
[0:37:51] <%AzureGale> Best boss battle ever
[0:37:52] <%rottingpastry> pew pew
[0:37:52] <+D00msDayDan> speaking of dumb game journalists did you see them get all pissy about polygon getting called out for not knowing who viper is? according to them fact checking means you hate women
[0:37:57] <UTaken34> DADDY SERVO
[0:37:59] <%justcallmebobplease> PRAISE FATHER SERVO
[0:38:00] <%bigboyeggo> @Gloom_Tangerine man that is such a boring opinion that i can't even mock him for it
[0:38:01] <%MelBrooksKA> I can't believe Pat called Automata the worst game ever spyCappa
[0:38:02] <olm46> Jackass, 6O and 21O had potential but didn't do much.
[0:38:11] <Laecerelius> That flying, talking book sure is rad
[0:38:13] <%solracc25> this cannot continue
[0:38:19] <%SilvaChariot0133> Well with Shades running around a floating book probably ain't too much of a stretch
[0:38:20] <+Kindan55> I honestly feel these actual story sidequests should have seperate icons, cos most people will probably miss them
[0:38:21] <zenith0111> They live in a apocalypse where ROBOTS SHOOT MAGIC
[0:38:25] <Djinnazz> @PatStaresAt Well, i mean when you're being attacked by shadow monsters on a daily basis.
[0:38:34] <%BoxNavy> 21o has some stuff
[0:38:40] <+datmegamandeeeee> Considering the existence of shades, they are probably just happy they aren’t being attacked
[0:38:40] <%solracc25> Nobody gives a shades ass about the talking book
[0:38:41] <boardscanada> yeah it sucks there was never meaningful story DLC for Automata
[0:38:41] <+Kindan55> They need a big plus on them like XIV LUL
[0:38:41] <%rottingpastry> @Kindan55 real heroes do all the quests
[0:38:42] <%AzureGale> Poor 6O, forgotten by the in-game cast :(
[0:38:43] <tattleworm> there was stuff but mostly in the sidequests
[0:38:43] <%Monkeyweed21> 21O turning into a Mommy was great
[0:38:43] <Melchior_the_Wise> Also Weiss is kind of a a Legend
[0:38:45] <+SeventhVice> @PatStaresAt are you not worried about time gated quests??
[0:38:45] <+chiazam> That letter makes it seem that it takes like a DAY to go to Oceanfront
[0:38:48] <Blank9> it's really hard to beat having your idiot crew in this
[0:38:48] <%Gloom_Tangerine> @bigboyeggo Travis had been on kind of a big pissy fit lately
[0:38:51] <%rottingpastry> glhf
[0:38:51] <%Axellogic> I think RPGs are better when you spend more time in hubs
[0:38:56] <%maskofmichael> What if other people had floating books before you?
[0:38:57] <%psidefx> time to get DESTROYED
[0:38:57] <Blank9> like weiss is just too damn good
[0:38:58] <Djinnazz> dmg spung, skip!\
[0:39:00] <%greasypete00> idk if someone has already said this but lighthouse lady is rita repulsa as well

[0:39:15] <penitentpendant> Chip damage boss fight
[0:39:15] <%ssjklyco> He's OP
[0:39:16] <%Axellogic> itll take awhile
[0:39:16] <+oda_flobunaga> easy fight, just takes 10 minutes
[0:39:22] <+datmegamandeeeee> Big xp
[0:39:22] <lemon_lover28> I like the operators but yeah, they only got like a one side quest each and their small amount of main quest dialogue
[0:39:23] <tattleworm> this guy drops two really good early game words
[0:39:24] <%rottingpastry> you might get a big loud word or you might get nothing
[0:39:26] <%bread_assassin> Memory cage prolly coulda been put into the game as like a DLC episode or something.
[0:39:27] <zenith0111> He drops rare items and word
[0:39:27] <%SaiyanShoto> You can beat him, it just takes a bit
[0:39:27] <tattleworm> you hardly need them though
[0:39:28] <boardscanada> if you think about it, Automata is more of a Platinum action game with very light RPG elements, while Nier 1 is straight up a deconstructionist take on Zelda OOT
[0:39:28] <T_Sasquatch> Sure
[0:39:30] <AoiRob> just parry it
[0:39:33] <%BoxNavy> just chillin :)
[0:39:34] <+chiazam> hit em
[0:39:37] <%solracc25> lame it put
[0:39:37] <T_Sasquatch> He one shot me

[0:40:08] <boardscanada> yeah in the beginning this guy oneshotted me a lot but he is perfectly doable
[0:40:08] <%NitronStreams> F
[0:40:08] <lemon_lover28> not verticals I guess
[0:40:08] <+Kindan55> Worst thing about hard mode is it makes these mini bosses into unbearable damage sponges.
[0:40:08] <%wibbwobbler> nooo
[0:40:09] <%Jaxnos> LMAO
[0:40:09] <%BoxNavy> EleGiggle
[0:40:10] <supersugoisenpai1> That went well
[0:40:11] <+ABigPinkLion> you can't parry the overhead
[0:40:12] <+datmegamandeeeee> Yep
[0:40:12] <+D00msDayDan> that wasn't a sideswipe
[0:40:12] <iosephe> lol
[0:40:12] <%za7az> LUL
[0:40:12] <%justcallmebobplease> EL KABONK'd
[0:40:13] <ItsPastas> he's a OHKO this early in the game
[0:40:13] <Halospaz117> that wasn't a side swipe
[0:40:14] <dan_g_v> who called it?
[0:40:15] <%weissguard> I beat Ending A of Automata like an hour ago. Man, that Eve fight is kinda awful LUL Adam's cool though
[0:40:16] <%rottingpastry> go directly to replicant jail
[0:40:17] <Visorak6> That wasnt a side swipe
[0:40:17] <tattleworm> it's definitely possible but yeah mashing ain't gonna do it
[0:40:18] <%AzureGale> LUL
[0:40:18] <%psidefx> fuggin wrekt
[0:40:19] <+SeventhVice> @PatStaresAt are you not worried about time gated quests
[0:40:20] <%Jaxnos> tbf, that wasn't a sideswipe
[0:40:20] <JoshManVGH> You can parry his fists, but you may get 0 mistakes to use
[0:40:22] <%Axellogic> I warned you I should have been the one guy
[0:40:22] <%SaiyanShoto> That wasn't a sideswipe LUL
[0:40:24] <zenith0111> OVERHEAD LUL
[0:40:25] <%Jaxnos> he came from above
[0:40:25] <%Garthunox> not his overheads
[0:40:26] <karovus> just parry the one-hit ko pat
[0:40:26] <%bevyrage> was that a side-swipe pat? no it was an overhead
[0:40:30] <+chiazam> was that a side swipe?
[0:40:30] <+oda_flobunaga> Stay away from it and shoot it till it dies
[0:40:35] <%JoshManVGH> Curse my slow typing
[0:40:39] <%MelBrooksKA> If only that wasn't a side swipe
[0:40:40] <%BoxNavy> monkaS
[0:40:40] <+chiazam> SHOULD'VE HIT THE DP
[0:40:45] <AoiRob> just parry the OHKOs
[0:40:46] <%SaiyanShoto> The sideswipes you can parry but that was a bonk LUL
[0:40:46] <boardscanada> his ground slam can't be parried but his jabs can
[0:40:47] <tattleworm> the only time gate is the act switch, don't worry about it
[0:40:51] <tanarath> Sideswipe = overhead, gotcha
[0:40:53] <%Cn_alpha_02> Called it.
[0:40:54] <%solracc25> lame it out like how it's intended
[0:40:56] <zenith0111> Does he mean farming?
[0:40:59] <%rottingpastry> not entirely true
[0:40:59] <Mattais88> @OfficioPrefectusCorgi I just booted it up and the update installed, so I think it's live
[0:41:04] <+Kindan55> Just leave him for a bit, not worth it
[0:41:04] <%rottingpastry> if yonah is in bed, she can't cook for you
[0:41:06] <Blank9> there's like no real missables pre-timeskip, besides getting a good sword in the forest early
[0:41:32] <%SilvaChariot0133> It's just XP
[0:41:34] <%Axellogic> Dying is bad
[0:41:35] <%Roasted_Pheasant> Roasted_Pheasant subscribed at Tier 1. They've subscribed for 32 months, currently on a 11 month streak! Hey there Pat-ches the Hyena. Comin up on 3 years soon, and I feel old. Speaking of old, how does it feel going from best Dad protag to not?
[0:41:37] <tattleworm> mash r1 like a champ
[0:41:38] <+ZipperHands> Nah, you can do all of part 1's quest so long as you don't do the timeskip
[0:41:39] <zenith0111> Youre meant to run
[0:41:44] <%bevyrage> to be fair you did twice as much damage using the dark lance
[0:41:44] <+D00msDayDan> he just drops a word and sometimes stuff you can sell
[0:41:44] <maskedmook> its not
[0:41:45] <%AzureGale> Your shorts can't protect you here, Nier
[0:41:45] <%Garthunox> The only time gate is the second half, and even then, no side quest in the first half has a weapon reward
[0:41:46] <lemon_lover28> Yonah dies if you don't eat the Mackerel
[0:41:48] <%Jaxnos> i gotta word off him, but eh
[0:41:49] <%maybefalco> its not worth it, i can confirm
[0:41:51] <+ABigPinkLion> you get some good words, that's kinda it
[0:41:53] <%SaiyanShoto> I didn't even get a level when I beat him LUL
[0:41:55] <%ssjklyco> come back with another party member
[0:41:57] <+oda_flobunaga> I got a rare word for killing it
[0:41:58] <tattleworm> he drops paralyse which is amazing on dark blast but yeah, you don't need it
[0:41:58] <%BoxNavy> get the beastbain and come back if you really care
[0:42:02] <%thbluewarden> Brave brave sir robbin
[0:42:02] <karovus> just stomp his ass in a few levels
[0:42:03] <zenith0111> @jaxnos You get multiple
[0:42:03] <boardscanada> it's like dark souls, put an overlevelled enemy early game
[0:42:09] <DanThePumpkinman> i love that you've literally changed his name to buttons
[0:42:12] <penitentpendant> Not all the remixes are better than the originals, but boy do I love the new soundtrack
[0:42:13] <%bigboyeggo> how do you forget that??
[0:42:16] <+Kindan55> is not
[0:42:19] <lemon_lover28> I also forgot that they did anything combat wise
[0:42:20] <%JoshManVGH> how does time pass in this game exactly? I came back home after a trip to Seafront and all my crops grew AND died immediatly.
[0:42:22] <%shurtal> and go CAMPING with KAINE
[0:42:26] <Melchior_the_Wise> Not this quest
[0:42:30] <boardscanada> manvsgame spent like 5 hours on that guy LULW
[0:42:31] <%BoxNavy> aww

[0:42:38] <%Jaxnos> ooooh really? i completely forgot. i just remember fighting him the second time and getting another word
[0:42:38] <%SaiyanShoto> oh
[0:42:40] <Random_ass_hero> This damn quest
[0:42:45] <%rottingpastry> @JoshManVGH it should just be the clock
[0:42:45] <Ninoace> oh boy
[0:42:49] <cardamomo88> pls let dog be fine
[0:42:49] <%NitronStreams> I think in Japanese the dogs name is John
[0:42:53] <%Garthunox> uh oh
[0:42:53] <%solracc25> psaDogchamp
[0:42:57] <zenith0111> @jaxnos Hes mainly a rare item farm
[0:42:57] <AoiRob> missing loved one in a NieR game? this will surely go swimmingly
[0:42:58] <+D00msDayDan> what could possibly go wrong if a dog is involved?
[0:42:59] <penitentpendant> The ground is eating his left foot
[0:43:03] <vicepresidentrichardhawk> well Fuck
[0:43:05] <%SaiyanShoto> He just busted in his pants
[0:43:05] <penitentpendant> No wonder he's in pain
[0:43:06] <%weissguard> psaDogchamp psaDogchamp psaDogchamp
[0:43:08] <tattleworm> @JoshManVGH it uses your pc/console clock so real days cause them to grow
[0:43:13] <tanarath> OhMyDog OhMyDog
[0:43:13] <%Jaxnos> nice
[0:43:27] <boardscanada> honestly doing all these side quests to me feels a bit like death stranding - it's kinda comfy
[0:43:32] <bubbli97> oh no
[0:43:33] <zenith0111> Item Drop Up > Exp Up
[0:43:41] <TheHeroAppears> oh that's a funny thing to add
[0:43:42] <+chiazam> YEAAAAAAAAAAAAA
[0:43:48] <%rottingpastry> I think it takes about a real day for a plant to go from planted to dead? Maybe a little more
[0:43:48] <twohitgood> liquor up popola and get them to sing.
[0:43:52] <%BoxNavy> oh man. i wish i knew about this quest jermaPluto
[0:43:55] <+chiazam> duet time
[0:44:02] <%Jeshk0> have you ever seen devola and popala in the same room together?? hmmmmm??
[0:44:08] <$Futurecity10> @PatStaresAt you need 5 mouse tails from the junk heap, and 5 lizard tails from the Eastern Plains
[0:44:14] <+l_nadex> the sidequests are fine, but the flower cultivation shit is straight up dogpoop
[0:44:19] <zenith0111> ^
[0:44:19] <%BoxNavy> @Jeshk0 yes, actually :)
[0:44:22] <%holydeviant1> I was looking for advice from friends in FF about Moogle King and one of them casually dropped Knights of the Round spoilers should I block them y/n
[0:44:25] <%MisterRockett> Baffling how Papa Nier would have never head them sing. Unless they change the line so he remembers it.
[0:44:29] <%bigboyeggo> this quest
[0:44:30] <%Jaxnos> the quest you just began
[0:44:31] <%Roasted_Pheasant> But how many bear asses do we need?

[0:44:33] <TheTakkster> Is that ginger important?
[0:44:34] <$Futurecity10> @PatStaresAt For the devola and popola quest
[0:44:35] <olm46> What does Nier do with the rest of the rat/lizard?
[0:44:38] <Blank9> for the sidequest
[0:44:38] <+D00msDayDan> for this quest to get popola to sing
[0:44:39] <lemon_lover28> you do need those
[0:44:40] <+tactician0> just do it
[0:44:43] <twohitgood> lol
[0:44:43] <boardscanada> do you need the flower cultivation for anything other than being able to resell them for money?
[0:44:45] <%DrJamesWoods> oh no
[0:44:47] <%shootbang_exe> womp womp
[0:44:48] <%Garthunox> for this quest

[0:45:11] <zenith0111> He did that on purpose LUL
[0:45:12] <Djinnazz> sheep lady
[0:45:12] <boardscanada> you can't do roll with the fragile quests
[0:45:14] <%bigboyeggo> ALL OF IT
[0:45:16] <+mashinchaserr> all of it
[0:45:18] <Laecerelius> HER CHILDREN HUNGER, PAT
[0:45:18] <%Axellogic> MUTTON GET YOUR MUTTON mutton get your mutton
[0:45:20] <%JoshManVGH> Just smash it in front of the old man
[0:45:21] <twohitgood> infinite mutton for infinite moneys.
[0:45:22] <%BoxNavy> you can use her to farm money
[0:45:27] <Rixstarian> Mutton quest is repeatable for 1500 per 10
[0:45:28] <%thbluewarden> i need MOAR MUTTON!
[0:45:31] <Laecerelius> They require their flesh to be sated!
[0:45:33] <%Garthunox> ALL OF IT!
[0:45:34] <+chiazam> MUTTON ALL DAY EVERYDAY
[0:45:36] <%Axellogic> Tales of has eternally scarred me about mutton
[0:45:36] <twohitgood> here's your mutton ma'am.
[0:45:41] <Melchior_the_Wise> Just kill every single Sheep
[0:45:41] <%LouieRouie> They eat mutton everyday
[0:45:48] <%holydeviant1> It's interesting that no one comments of the floating mystical tome that follows you
[0:45:50] <zenith0111> Mutton is a ok momey farm if you do the fishing side quest youll be getting fish that sell for 1.5k a pop
[0:45:54] <%EynosStyles> @patstaresat that's okay you get a immunity to pain medication as a super power
[0:46:00] <%rottingpastry> if you get a sunny northern plain, you can get like 4500 bucks on a run it's fine I guess
[0:46:00] <%AzureGale> Do Ropers drop mutton
[0:46:02] <pixelkenj> do you like your coffee hot or iced
[0:46:10] <%Axellogic> Scarred but in the bacground of all the cities is the same crier going "MUTTON GET YOUR MUTTON" constantly
[0:46:19] <boardscanada> the floating book always being onscreen is new BTW - on the PS3/360 Weiss would disappear in towns and only appear when you shoot briefly
[0:46:20] <%Treuan> She gotta get krunk
[0:46:24] <%Axellogic> in Tales of Games
[0:46:28] <iosephe> relatable
[0:46:28] <peyodogo> relatable content
[0:46:30] <%AzureGale> Get durnk
[0:46:30] <+oda_flobunaga> Krunkulla
[0:46:32] <+mashinchaserr> get drunk get dizzy
[0:46:41] <Laecerelius> Poppy need krunk now!
[0:46:44] <+Bluecille> relatable
[0:46:46] <%BoxNavy> 🥃 :)
[0:46:48] <pixelkenj> not the normal stuff, she needs some green absinthe
[0:46:52] <+chiazam> BACK TO SEAFRONT
[0:46:53] <boardscanada> come to think of it - Weiss is literally Navi from Zelda OOT
[0:46:56] <Rixstarian> Might as well do Fragile Delivery there. Same place anyway
[0:46:57] <xinexes> she needs to get skilp foinged
[0:46:58] <+Stormzcales_Lair> which tales is this so one can prepare
[0:46:58] <%SaiyanShoto> But do it though
[0:46:58] <tanarath> Get the seafront krunk, gotcha
[0:47:03] <%BoxNavy> pat no longer crunks up
[0:47:03] <%shurtal> the fear of shittin pants on stream?
[0:47:05] <zenith0111> I love the little hints they drop throughout this side quest about Popola and Devolas background if you pay attention
[0:47:06] <%Dakuu75> wasted on stream, really? never guessed it.
[0:47:06] <lemon_lover28> because you balls have already been exposed
[0:47:07] <%AzureGale> You just need the power of heart
[0:47:11] <$Futurecity10> @PatStaresAt So as I was saying you need those tails for the bar keep to make her booze
[0:47:12] <%Huntercd> Liquor
[0:47:12] <%psidefx> The mara-ja-wine
[0:47:16] <%za7az> Hell yeah Pat, crush that social anxiety
[0:47:20] <Blank9> all you need is brain go good
[0:47:20] <+mashinchaserr> she needs that sing good juice
[0:47:26] <%bevyrage> @boardscanada yeah 'cept weiss isn't annoying and actually does more than just assist your z-target
[0:47:31] <%NitronStreams> All he needs is that sweet sweet WEED JUICE
[0:47:34] <%rottingpastry> you went there for the lost shrine
[0:47:38] <TheTakkster> did pat get wine drunk?
[0:47:38] <zenith0111> Lizards are by the shore in the plains
[0:47:39] <+D00msDayDan> lizards are on the road before the desert
[0:47:40] <Melchior_the_Wise> you think the Lizard Tails are a reference to Shadow of the Colossus?
[0:47:41] <%Axellogic> So everytime I hear the word mutton I think of that stupid crier in the background noise of Tales of Games never shutting up about his mutton
[0:47:45] <%Garthunox> @PatStaresAt You need lizard and mouse tails for this quest, lizard tails can be gotten on the eastern highway, mouse tails at junk heap, outside, tho not in the dungeon
[0:47:48] <%rottingpastry> but I don't think they start spawning then?
[0:47:50] <%Dakuu75> I thought Pat got 5 or more rat tails last time, eh?
[0:47:50] <lemon_lover28> hang in there. Gotta catch some lizards so a girl will sing
[0:47:55] <zehdre> mamoru child...
[0:47:57] <%Treuan> Open mouth, insert fish
[0:47:58] <Djinnazz> @PatStaresAt You download the Automata addon stuff?
[0:47:59] <pixelkenj> just eat the fish spleen raw
[0:48:01] <%AzureGale> Is Yonah still voiced by Heather Hogan Watson?
[0:48:02] <%BoxNavy> child eat fish
[0:48:04] <tanarath> Time to squeeze the medicine fish
[0:48:07] <%rottingpastry> fix child
[0:48:08] <Visorak6> "I will now proceed to medicate myself with this fish"
[0:48:10] <boardscanada> @bevyrage yeah it's Navi except with a sarcastic deadpan personality and the ability to attack
[0:48:11] <stormhawk9891> @Axellogic MUTTON FRESH MUTTON
[0:48:12] <%Dakuu75> did you enjoy your NEURO-TOXINS?! lol
[0:48:13] <karovus> lizards can be found in the northern plains too but eastern road is easier in my experience
[0:48:16] <pixelkenj> thats why its called a shaman
[0:48:17] <JetpackMcQuack> Ending M
[0:48:17] <zehdre> Perhaps she's just extremely malnourished.
[0:48:18] <pixelkenj> its magic
[0:48:20] <%ssjklyco> It's the Mercury
[0:48:20] <%bassoontyphoon> psaBig
[0:48:20] <$Futurecity10> It stops the pain
[0:48:22] <maskedmook> its magic
[0:48:23] <+eanscrale> Good fish my man
[0:48:23] <zenith0111> Its numbs the pain
[0:48:23] <+Ataraxis9> fish oil
[0:48:24] <$Cobra743> neurotoxin
[0:48:24] <%Ozavic> It's magic, fuck you
[0:48:24] <tattleworm> it's just a painkiller
[0:48:24] <lemon_lover28> tasty fish
[0:48:25] <iosephe> it's a robot fish
[0:48:26] <%Huntercd> Get that girl some morphine @PatStaresAt
[0:48:26] <+mashinchaserr> chemicals in the fish that help the child
[0:48:27] <%shurtal> I dunno man, i've had some good sushi
[0:48:30] <+D00msDayDan> maybe it's got the same chemical in it that makes mackarel lethal to androids
[0:48:31] <cardamomo88> is a very good fish
[0:48:33] <ExpressNode> It's that omega 3 at work
[0:48:33] <Zebroneath> i dont think it stopped it, it just stopped the pain
[0:48:33] <thelonechris> Magic is the dumbest shit
[0:48:33] <AoiRob> just painkiller
[0:48:33] <%EynosStyles> there is a literal floating talking book
[0:48:34] <%thbluewarden> Thats some damn fine fish, damn fine
[0:48:34] <pixelkenj> give her some mackerel
[0:48:35] <%SilvaChariot0133> Wait
[0:48:37] <%BoxNavy> its just for the pain, yeah
[0:48:40] <Melchior_the_Wise> Weissey!
[0:48:43] <DeathByPoke7> the fish is a shaman
[0:48:43] <pixelkenj> :)
[0:48:43] <%Finalgear14> it's a pain suppressant, not  something stopping the scrawl
[0:48:44] <Laecerelius> Maybe it's mackrel?
[0:48:44] <penitentpendant> I guess if they're real they have some sort of immunity the Chlorination
[0:48:44] <%solracc25> books talk pat
[0:48:44] <%Gloom_Tangerine> Pat, opium comes from a flower
[0:48:46] <%SilvaChariot0133> how did the villager know him as Weissey when Yonah wasn't awake yet?
[0:48:49] <%bassoontyphoon> I mean there’s floating books so I feel anything’s on the table
[0:48:50] <+oda_flobunaga> don't you mean SHAAAAAAAAAAIIIIIDS
[0:48:50] <%BoxNavy> its fine :)
[0:48:51] <pixelkenj> who cares
[0:48:54] <+chiazam> haAHAHAHAHAAA
[0:48:56] <+eanscrale> Dude don't be rude.
[0:48:57] <%rottingpastry> @karovus yeah, in the north they sometimes spawn under the junk heap bridge. in the east, I don't think I've ever seen them not spawn.
[0:49:02] <alextrebeken> i mean like shades exist
[0:49:04] <+Caidezes> There's magic around, Pat.
[0:49:05] <pixelkenj> The Most they get is "Man this book is kinda rude"
[0:49:07] <zehdre> I mean, there are shadow monsters running amok
[0:49:09] <boardscanada> the realization that this game was like a Zelda OOT riff never really occurred to me as Papa Nier but now with kid Nier it's apparent as hell, even the timeskip is there
[0:49:10] <maskedmook> I mean they see shades every dag
[0:49:10] <cardamomo88> is day all the time who cares
[0:49:12] <%Axellogic> "My gradma knew a book once!"
[0:49:16] <%ssjklyco> Even Nier wan't that fazed by it
[0:49:18] <%holydeviant1> When he gets really angry does he like, flip his pages aggressively at people
[0:49:21] <%solracc25> High fives the book
[0:49:21] <+chiazam> SHADOW MONSTERS PAT
[0:49:23] <%Wallabri> world's full of shades and giant tarantulas, book's not that bad
[0:49:24] <Blank9> it's weird that they aren't scared of the book, but they get spooked by other shit
[0:49:26] <%AzureGale> LUL
[0:49:26] <Blank9> even wolves
[0:49:29] <HeroToxiko> theres a boar king, who cares about magic book?
[0:49:30] <%wibbwobbler> would not trust it
[0:49:31] <pixelkenj> ahhh, she's an anime cook
[0:49:33] <%Chester_goes_Berserk> these games are written by a drunk man so it's all cool
[0:49:35] <Rixstarian> @rottingpastry There's 2 between entrance & desert
[0:49:36] <%AzureGale> Time to find some PISS
[0:49:41] <zenith0111> Tbf whos scared of books?
[0:49:50] <%rottingpastry> yeah there's always 2 lol
[0:49:50] <+oda_flobunaga> When Weiss gets pissed, he throws the book at ppl...... wait
[0:49:51] <pixelkenj> 90% wheat, 10% stew
[0:49:54] <%holydeviant1> @pixelkenj have you had actual bad cooking
[0:49:55] <boardscanada> vennison - southern plains
[0:49:55] <Tracazoid> Venison is south of the town
[0:49:55] <%ssjklyco> Near the south
[0:49:57] <ItsPastas> One each
[0:49:57] <%SilvaChariot0133> South plains for venison
[0:49:58] <+chiazam> NO WHEAT
[0:49:58] <+Pilau32> @zenith0111 americans
[0:49:58] <Djinnazz> wheat you can buy in town.
[0:49:59] <thelonechris> They're just like "Dumbass book, I hope someone rips a page out."
[0:49:59] <%bigboyeggo> 10 of each iirc, venison is south and you need to grow wheat
[0:50:01] <$Futurecity10> @PatStaresAt Wheat at the market of this town, and venison from the deer on the south plain
[0:50:02] <%NitronStreams> My Sister's cooking cant possibly be this vomit inducing!
[0:50:02] <%SilvaChariot0133> wheat can be bought
[0:50:02] <shieldecho> Venison's in the place where you fought the giant shade
[0:50:04] <pixelkenj> Venison is near Seafront
[0:50:04] <%rottingpastry> you can buy wheat
[0:50:08] <%bevyrage> venison is deer meat, and wheat is... vendor in town
[0:50:08] <%ssjklyco> Where you fought the big monster
[0:50:09] <Melchior_the_Wise> wheat can be bought at seafront
[0:50:12] <%SaiyanShoto> Venison is on the way to seafront and the wheat I just grew
[0:50:15] <$Futurecity10> @PatStaresAt 1 of each
[0:50:17] <pixelkenj> and You can buy wheat
[0:50:18] <%BoxNavy> @boardscanada suddenly rolling around being faster than just running and a big grassy plain that leads to other areas and all the macguffin finding makes total sense
[0:50:19] <%rottingpastry> lol it's 1 of each for yonah I think?
[0:50:19] <%SaiyanShoto> you just need 1 wheat and 10 venison
[0:50:20] <%JoshManVGH> grow wheat or buy gor 500g
[0:50:22] <Nupinoop296> that's such a waste of food since her cooking is bad
[0:50:25] <+Birdigalore> The wheat grows on deer
[0:50:28] <Nupinoop296> how does he know what a four star chef is
[0:50:33] <%AzureGale> SUCK IT WEISS
[0:50:33] <%neroforte177> is it me or is game like 90% fetch quests
[0:50:34] <%EynosStyles> a dead brother
[0:50:34] <zenith0111> This game is more or less Harvest Moon once you REALLY start grinding
[0:50:35] <zehdre> Man, these lines are SO much better as an old man. It's so crazy.
[0:50:35] <%ssjklyco> This is a different line from the OG nier
[0:50:45] <Rixstarian> He needs a lot of wheat for another quest anyway
[0:50:45] <shieldecho> Ah yes, the gimmick of otherwise perfect female character can't cook
[0:50:47] <Blank9> I miss papa nier talking about that
[0:50:47] <%SaiyanShoto> Or just check the quest and it'll tell you
[0:50:48] <$Futurecity10> @PatStaresAt You can check the items you need under the quest tab. But I believe its 1 wheat and 1 venison
[0:50:49] <cardamomo88> CAN HE EVEN TASTE??
[0:50:53] <%BoxNavy> one wheats
[0:50:55] <+chiazam> @Nupinoop296 Grimoire Weiss knows all
[0:50:57] <%rottingpastry> quest complete
[0:51:00] <boardscanada> @BoxNavy yeah I guess for whatever reason it just never felt apparent with papa nier, now with kid nier it's obvious
[0:51:06] <%bigboyeggo> booo
[0:51:07] <%BoxNavy> got him
[0:51:09] <%AzureGale> NIER: WE HAVE THE WHEATS
[0:51:12] <Mr_JustinJones> good one.... not
[0:51:15] <Melchior_the_Wise> Grimoire Wheats Kappa
[0:51:15] <penitentpendant> Flarbys, We Have THE WHEATS
[0:51:19] <+Birdigalore> Yonah needs wheat, badly!@
[0:51:23] <%SilvaChariot0133> Brother Nier is alright
[0:51:25] <zenith0111> Papa Nier kinda sucked tbh
[0:51:25] <%Garthunox> now get some whets
[0:51:34] <+Kashishh> Grimoire Weiss more like Grimoire Nice
[0:51:35] <%MisterRockett> I get brother nier's point but causing people trouble by trying to be helpful is basically just an empathy jerk-off. You shouldn't feed into that.
[0:51:42] <%weissguard> Puns are ingrained here, it seems
[0:51:45] <Blank9> it makes papa nier into a himbo, it's great
[0:51:47] <DeathByPoke7> I miss pappa nier too
[0:51:48] <boardscanada> can't lie, some of the story moments hit much harder for me with papa nier, but I appreciate that both scripts are different now
[0:51:48] <%AzureGale> Why not both
[0:51:49] <%za7az> @zenith0111 He was great and you are a monster
[0:51:50] <+ssjklyco> They actually have some different lines in most situations.
[0:51:51] <pixelkenj> show us what youve learned about cooking Pat
[0:51:52] <Blank9> he's just kronk
[0:51:55] <%SilvaChariot0133> MORTIS
[0:51:55] <%greasypete00> is yona's voice different? it sounds different and slightly better imo
[0:51:55] <lemon_lover28> Papa Nier looked super ugly though
[0:51:58] <%Garthunox> WE'RE FRIENDS NOW!
[0:52:00] <%rottingpastry> I feel like all choices are wrongt
[0:52:02] <%EynosStyles> @Patstaresat what vital bodily function would trade for magical powers?
[0:52:03] <+D00msDayDan> post-timeskip brother nier turned me around on him
[0:52:04] <%ssjklyco> And their tones are different
[0:52:08] <cardamomo88> WutFace
[0:52:08] <zenith0111> @za7az It ruins other characters
[0:52:09] <$Cobra743> *dead*
[0:52:12] <%Wallabri> KAINE! WE'RE FRIENDS NOW!
[0:52:13] <+azure_rivers> NotLikeThis
[0:52:14] <%Chester_goes_Berserk> papa Nier is a rare case of publisher execs having a good design idea
[0:52:15] <Rixstarian> @greasypete00 Rerecording
[0:52:17] <%AzureGale> Do you prefer raw meat or big meat
[0:52:17] <Djinnazz> ewww
[0:52:18] <%BoxNavy> its great moon2B
[0:52:18] <thelonechris> It's diarrhea
[0:52:19] <%rottingpastry> well, at least you won't get worms
[0:52:19] <Daxalog> The smell is ugly
[0:52:19] <%RetroCop87> @PatStaresAt good thing the remaster is so authentic, modders can just plop papa nier into the story
[0:52:21] <%wibbwobbler> a boy named nier
[0:52:22] <%NitronStreams> EAT YOUR SLIME NIER
[0:52:22] <boardscanada> I hope that a few months from now they release like a $20 DLC - papa nier with all voice acting redone - that'd be worth $20
[0:52:23] <+chiazam> WELP
[0:52:23] <Nupinoop296> NieR nooooo
[0:52:23] <%SilvaChariot0133> GAME OVER
[0:52:27] <illtima> Pat should I try completing all of the game's sidequests and upgrading all the weapons?
[0:52:27] <+guyremex> ooooo nooooo
[0:52:28] <cardamomo88> ending P for poison
[0:52:28] <tanarath> M O R T I S
[0:52:31] <+Birdigalore> TOILET!  WE'RE FRIENDS NOW!
[0:52:32] <Nupinoop296> YOU DIED
[0:52:33] <%MisterRockett> "Character who constantly gets into trouble by trying to be helpful" is a narrative trope that's so annoying to me cause it's a direct contradiction that never gets called out.
[0:52:34] <$Cobra743> F
[0:52:36] <%solracc25> eat it
[0:52:36] <Mr_JustinJones> eat up judah ben hur
[0:52:39] <%Monkeyweed21> OH NO SHE COOKS BRITISH FOOD
[0:52:39] <%Axellogic> EAT YOUR  MAKERAL BROTHER
[0:52:39] <%MuffledEurobeat> Could use more salt Kappa
[0:52:40] <shieldecho> "And that's the end of my story."
[0:52:40] <%dkzk21> papa nier does come across grumpier.
[0:52:45] <%BoxNavy> NO
[0:52:46] <lemon_lover28> @Wallabri that was so weird with Papa Nier
[0:52:46] <LordOfThePoultry> DO IT
[0:52:47] <%dkzk21> but its great
[0:52:51] <Djinnazz> put do it though
[0:52:53] <penitentpendant> In Automata or Replicant?
[0:52:56] <%rottingpastry> do what you want
[0:52:56] <%RetroCop87> some weapons are sidequest locked, no?
[0:52:56] <Oxybe> DO IT! Consume all your time!
[0:52:56] <pixelkenj> but you need to do quests to afford weapons
[0:52:57] <%solracc25> Ending S for Stew
[0:52:59] <iosephe> weapon stories tho
[0:53:02] <%fishmonger555> but weapon stories....
[0:53:03] <boardscanada> a lot of dialogue was changed between papa nier and brother, people who say it's exactly the same lines are wrong
[0:53:04] <%JoshManVGH> Oh you don't have to max them out?
[0:53:05] <+chiazam> I'MMA DO IT ANYWAY
[0:53:07] <Tracazoid> *Is currently doing just that*
[0:53:07] <m_ccloud> a lot of the side quests aren't really worth it in replicant
[0:53:08] <+davidwave4_> This game is flipping gorgeous!
[0:53:10] <%Garthunox> If you want the plat then do it
[0:53:12] <zenith0111> Also PapaNiers excuse for not getting Greatsword early on is stupid LUL
[0:53:18] <pixelkenj> :)
[0:53:18] <+chiazam> weapon stories here I come
[0:53:24] <TheTakkster> Monster Hunter rise Patch 2.0 is live.  Update Manually.
[0:53:26] <Melchior_the_Wise> Apparently you had to upgrade all the weapons to get an ending in one of the Drakengard games
[0:53:28] <Melchior_the_Wise> fuck that
[0:53:29] <+traximus_s> @birdigalore alright that was good heres a cookie
[0:53:36] <%BoxNavy> or alternatively, take your time and enjoy the game however you want :)
[0:53:37] <penitentpendant> That was quick
[0:53:44] <%AzureGale> *blink*
[0:53:46] <pixelkenj> Yeah I dont get that either
[0:53:49] <zehdre> Don't worry about it
[0:53:50] <cardamomo88> WHO KNOWS PAT
[0:53:53] <%RetroCop87> pigeon carrier
[0:53:54] <+D00msDayDan> how does seafront find out before you do?
[0:53:54] <+chiazam> @Melchior_the_Wise yeah that game
[0:53:56] <Oxybe> MonHunt update is so slow... update faster Switch!
[0:53:59] <zenith0111> @melchior_the_wise Like Automata :)
[0:54:00] <penitentpendant> Is there like... a cell phone under that table?
[0:54:01] <%bread_assassin> @zenith0111 what was it again?
[0:54:03] <tattleworm> you can read the letter in documents if you want the context @PatStaresAt
[0:54:04] <%Axellogic> Checka look!
[0:54:07] <Tracazoid> All of those innocent assholes of the Aerie
[0:54:10] <%rottingpastry> seafront has a boat?
[0:54:14] <tanarath> #checkuhlook
[0:54:19] <%SilvaChariot0133> SSD REALLY fucks you on those
[0:54:19] <cardamomo88> brbbhesjhsj
[0:54:20] <Nupinoop296> what was that
[0:54:21] <+Birdigalore> OITTA GO FAST
[0:54:22] <penitentpendant> Almost
[0:54:24] <+Qexec> damn you PS5
[0:54:24] <thelonechris> What happened?
[0:54:24] <%SilvaChariot0133> there are new ones
[0:54:25] <boardscanada> it's literally Zelda OOT - you also have to backtrack and go back to the same locations in OOT post-timeskip
[0:54:26] <%cvp5127> keep walking out of the libraruy
[0:54:27] <+D00msDayDan> curse you modern load times
[0:54:28] <%solracc25> that old lady isn't innocent.
[0:54:28] <%rottingpastry> the loading screens are fast enough in this new ssd world that you can't read it all
[0:54:29] <%Huntercd> Did Pat meet big dicked Kaine?
[0:54:34] <%NitronStreams> They need a pause button for those screens
[0:54:35] <%EynosStyles> innocent is a matter of perspective really
[0:54:35] <pixelkenj> I NEVER got a Loading screen Report until Act 2
[0:54:37] <BoxNavy> theres not enough time to read and internalize those lol
[0:54:38] <DeathByPoke7> happens to me on pc too
[0:54:38] <%Tenkay> Theres new loading screens ye
[0:54:41] <+chiazam> you read slow
[0:54:43] <Daniel_Is_I> I just started taking screenshots of that
[0:54:44] <%Jaxnos> don't worry everyone, that was just a regular Yonah diary entry
[0:54:51] <+BIumen> i got a new one there when i got it
[0:54:51] <+D00msDayDan> is it just RNG getting those before part 2?
[0:54:53] <zenith0111> @bread_assassin Nothing LUL for the OG its simply because hes not a boy but a man now but Papa is like 40 starting so his time skip is unjustified
[0:54:54] <OldManDeckardCain> and everything would have been solved if you had to press a button to leave the loading screen LUL
[0:54:55] <Earthun> just tuned in did we get papa Nier?
[0:54:56] <boardscanada> and instead of riding on epona you ride on a boar
[0:54:57] <Tracazoid> Loading screens these days with loading screen text need a, "press button to continue"
[0:54:57] <pixelkenj> Maybe the Aerie doesn't bother telling anyone so Seafront has to report for them
[0:55:03] <%thbluewarden> Quick! the knowledge!
[0:55:04] <jibolbadoobies> is this an expansion or a bona fide sequel?
[0:55:05] <%rottingpastry> why does yonah keep talking about chlorination this is weird
[0:55:05] <%RetroCop87> can you shoot birds?
[0:55:12] <+D00msDayDan> doggo is near the entrance to junk heap
[0:55:15] <%BoxNavy> die sheeps

[0:55:19] <Oxybe> Ridin' on boars!
[0:55:19] <%Jaxnos> i'm still a stinky PS4 owner, so I can read all of the loading screens juuuuust fine LUL
[0:55:25] <$Futurecity10> @PatStaresAt Doggo is near the water, near the junk heap ladder
[0:55:27] <Nupinoop296> those almost looks like KH Neoshadows
[0:55:31] <Nupinoop296> like at a glance
[0:55:31] <%JoshManVGH> On no! you hit all the....small...ones
[0:55:37] <%Axellogic> Yes kill them children
[0:55:38] <+D00msDayDan> hell yeah massacre those children
[0:55:38] <cardamomo88> yes kill them all
[0:55:38] <%EynosStyles> @jaxnos me too. lol
[0:55:45] <Random_ass_hero> Lizard is in that area
[0:55:46] <%rottingpastry> I don't remember the blood absorption voices being so loud I like it
[0:55:48] <Daxalog> What are they saying!
[0:55:50] <pixelkenj> stealing coloring books from shades
[0:55:51] <Saltmeisterr> why do they sound like that
[0:55:56] <boardscanada> @zenith0111 well i was comparing scenes earlier between the two and I like that after the timeskip popola remarks he looks terrible and is going to get himself killed, pretty much discouraging him from going through with his quest - she never does that with brother
[0:55:57] <Earthun> @Earthun never ever?
[0:55:58] <zehdre> "For some reason"
[0:55:58] <+Birdigalore> When you suck in blood it sounds like that suffocating pufferfish
[0:56:01] <Melchior_the_Wise> How many Genre's does Nier go through?
[0:56:06] <tanarath> I can't believe that the boar is just zangief
[0:56:06] <%RetroCop87> I got virtuous contract to lvl 3 super early by accident, and now I have a god-slayer
[0:56:06] <pixelkenj> Dog is on the other side of the ravine
[0:56:07] <%BoxNavy> they ransacked a school, duh
[0:56:12] <Melchior_the_Wise> I count at least 4
[0:56:13] <zehdre> @Birdigalore oh god it super does
[0:56:13] <Mr_JustinJones> hey it's that dog
[0:56:14] <+guyremex> some reason Kappa

[0:56:51] <rekinom> Monster Hunter Rise update is up for anyone interested
[0:57:01] <%Garthunox> WORKED OUT
[0:57:01] <LordOfThePoultry> do it again!
[0:57:07] <%bigboyeggo> that's a really weird way to phrase it weiss
[0:57:10] <+D00msDayDan> you have lost health, gamer
[0:57:13] <%AzureGale> Human Resources 6
[0:57:15] <%RetroCop87> hasn't it been out for only a month?
[0:57:16] <shieldecho> "You have lost health"
[0:57:17] <+Stormzcales_Lair> Also HR6 update is tomorrow
[0:57:18] <+itsgundamu> theres nothing for the end game so i'm glad they are adding so many monsters
[0:57:20] <%Monkeyweed21> fake fan
[0:57:21] <pixelkenj> Theres no story content until next month at least
[0:57:23] <Blank9> you couldn't even get past hr7, so not far behind
[0:57:27] <boardscanada> monster hunter rise kinda launched in a skeleton state really
[0:57:30] <%NitronStreams> "youve lost health" is such a weird thing for the character to say out loud
[0:57:40] <zenith0111> @boardscanada Devola remarks on how terrible he looks and it happens to Bro Nier too
[0:57:41] <+itsgundamu> @RetroCop87 yea but there is very little content in this compared to other MH games
[0:57:43] <%thelaxinator> Sounds like Shivers talking when you absorb blood
[0:57:47] <rekinom> @pixelkenj There's story content in the update that just came out lol
[0:57:48] <+Pilau32> Jeez Capcom, calm down, the game just came out
[0:57:48] <%rottingpastry> @RetroCop87 when you play vidja for a living, you tend to get far in vidja
[0:57:51] <%Treuan> 'Nier, your hit points have gone down'
[0:58:02] <%RetroCop87> there's a murder of kindegardeners around here
[0:58:03] <xeros720> thinking of just farming out a chameleos weapon or something, hopefully faster than going ruby hunting off rath
[0:58:10] <%BoxNavy> punch their asses off
[0:58:14] <%thbluewarden> Its fine. they're not you. they have to go.
[0:58:15] <+CodeRegios> i can't believe those shades stole those school books
[0:58:27] <cardamomo88> hah fuck you kids
[0:58:31] <boardscanada> @zenith0111 well I compared both scenes of his first talk with Popola after the timeskip - with brother it's almost flirty and commenting that he looks handsome and grown up, with father Nier she just says he looks terrible and has a death wish
[0:58:35] <peyodogo> evil

[0:59:12] <zenith0111> @boardscanada Ah yeah
[0:59:14] <%AzureGale> DED
[0:59:15] <%Jaxnos> strong. powerful. big die.
[0:59:17] <%RetroCop87> doggone shame
[0:59:17] <%Roasted_Pheasant> sipsipHonk
[0:59:20] <pixelkenj> took a nap next to the dog
[0:59:21] <rottingpastry> Yay party!
[0:59:26] <Mr_JustinJones> So thats what the gameover looks like
[0:59:27] <Daxalog> The witch hunts are over
[0:59:33] <+RealPT1> does the anime dash not work on shield dudes?
[0:59:38] <%Puhff> Happy Birthday!
[0:59:44] <Soulbld> @PatStaresAt Did you play the dad nier version?
[0:59:49] <BlackStarAura> The shadow remains cast
[0:59:50] <%RetroCop87> he spins when he collides with npc's
[0:59:50] <%rottingpastry> Weiss is pretty smart for a bitch.
[0:59:57] <+D00msDayDan> weiss is too high-class to clip into geometry
[1:00:03] <%NitronStreams> You think Weiss knows hes in a video game?
[1:00:05] <boardscanada> it's just good that both scripts are significantly different enough, that's why it'd be nice if there's a $20 DLC later with Dad Nier as a selectable protagonist, two perspectives on the same story, I'd pay for it
[1:00:17] <Mr_JustinJones> @Soulbld theres an LP on  youtube
[1:00:19] <twohitgood> mussou-ish
[1:00:20] <peyodogo> he's a bratty bottom tho not a swi--
[1:00:20] <%Monkeyweed21> @PatStaresAt try doing the fancy dodge with Heavy attack
[1:00:30] <+D00msDayDan> @boardscanada squanix said before that if this sells 2.5mil copies they'll add papa nier
[1:00:31] <%RetroCop87> dark blast is low key the best AOE spell
[1:00:41] <pixelkenj> If you dunk in the water too many times Nier mentions he cant swim, which I then apply to Papa Nier
[1:00:41] <zenith0111> @boardscanada Why pay for something we have? ;)
[1:00:50] <Melchior_the_Wise> @peyodogo is that like a Power-bottom
[1:00:52] <Melchior_the_Wise> ?
[1:00:59] <Blank9> dark phantasm's the best AOE in the game when you finally get that
[1:01:03] <%The_Gaming_Karp> I left to buy fruit - did I miss any main plot?
[1:01:10] <Laecerelius> Slap its shit!

[1:01:11] <boardscanada> @zenith0111 well it's kinda hard going back to gestalt on PS3/360 after this, the combat system got significantly improved
[1:01:24] <pixelkenj> ez
[1:01:32] <peyodogo> @Melchior_the_Wise nah, power bottoms "top from the bottom" so to speak, these are just bratty
[1:01:37] <%watts121> watts121 subscribed at Tier 1. They've subscribed for 5 months! 
[1:01:38] <%RetroCop87> @Blank9 I'd give the edge to dark blast, since it's good for 1v1 damage over time
[1:01:41] <%The_Gaming_Karp> a letter for the poor old man!?
[1:01:44] <zenith0111> Rip :(

[1:03:15] <%The_Gaming_Karp> I did not.
[1:03:15] <Melchior_the_Wise> and everybody dances
[1:03:16] <%Arancet> quiet you awful, awful, father
[1:03:25] <shieldecho> I got it
[1:03:25] <boardscanada> is Grimoire Weiss' characteri n the Japanese version significantly different? I heard he is called Shiro there, he seems to be narrated by the Automata pod. Does he still do this sarcastic British deadpan thing?
[1:03:30] <zenith0111> @boardscanada Im refering to Replicant ;)
[1:03:35] <Mr_JustinJones> I got you
[1:03:35] <%BoxNavy> was that a simpsons
[1:03:40] <%BoxNavy> ok it was a simpsons
[1:03:45] <@commanderclaw> 20 years ago was 2001
[1:03:47] <cardamomo88> i was not born yet
[1:03:48] <Parapattern> Probably 30 by now
[1:03:50] <%ssjklyco> Thats a 30 year joke
[1:03:50] <Saltmeisterr> HAHA OLD
[1:03:50] <twohitgood> that was a simpsons joke?
[1:03:51] <%watts121> After playing the remake...I gotta say there is a distinct lack of NieR doujins out on the wild.
[1:03:51] <+guyremex> pregnant pause
[1:03:53] <%Roasted_Pheasant> Quick what's her name?
[1:03:53] <+YseCrack> so as a person who hasn't played Nier, why is a book following him around?
[1:03:55] <%BoxNavy> i havent seen the simpsons in years sorry pat
[1:03:55] <%Ynkubus_> DOnt let it set in
[1:03:56] <%Monkeyweed21> 30 years at this point
[1:03:58] <%The_Gaming_Karp> Pretty sure 20 years ago was 1980
[1:03:59] <Mr_JustinJones> we're old
[1:04:00] <Blank9> 20 years ago was a space odyssey
[1:04:02] <%Arancet> but the old channel was all those jokes over and over again, who can people here not get them?
[1:04:03] <zenith0111> WutFace
[1:04:04] <+Kduff89> dont let it set in
[1:04:12] <%AzureGale> We thought you could use some pants
[1:04:12] <peyodogo> kaine!
[1:04:14] <boardscanada> @zenith0111 I'm sorry but for me Papa Nier will always be the superior way to experience the story, certain story segments just hit way harder
[1:04:14] <T_Sasquatch> @ysecrack play the Game
[1:04:14] <xxMylord> Why is the NIer guy a anime dude now?
[1:04:14] <+Plus_On_Black> It's hard to type and laugh all at once
[1:04:18] <twohitgood> i love this arrangement of the aerie.
[1:04:22] <%bigboyeggo> @watts121 that will probably change in the nier future
[1:04:27] <$Futurecity10> Isnt there a trophy to try and see Kaine's buldge?
[1:04:31] <%RetroCop87> People won't stop making fun of my floating book. The first such incident was in 3,568, when...
[1:04:32] <%Garthunox> I love you Kainé

[1:04:54] <%LeiaSkynoober> @YseCrack Book friend, he's magic and made a deal with Nier or somethin
[1:04:56] <%arcielardor> No, Naruto was Kaine running!
[1:05:04] <%RetroCop87> I love the new OST
[1:05:05] <Parapattern> "Here are several fine young men who I'm sure are gonna go far. Ladies and gentlemen, the Ramones."
[1:05:08] <Daxalog> I like how people just call it Naruto Running
[1:05:09] <Halospaz117> You got a Boar Drifter, a Flying Book, and a Naruto Runner. This party's locomotion is fucked
[1:05:10] <%BoxNavy> monkaS
[1:05:12] <%thbluewarden> the music sounds nicer than before
[1:05:25] <%shurtal> Kaine doesn't have trick attack on her hotbar

[1:06:37] <pixelkenj> Duke Nukem's descendant
[1:06:39] <FlyguyJP> She has a sailor's mouth... that's hot
[1:06:41] <penitentpendant> Isn't this the first hint she can understand what it 'says' since it's non-sequitur otherwise?
[1:06:43] <+D00msDayDan> even weiss is shook by her profanity
[1:06:44] <peyodogo> yeah, sounds like my old static's nin alright
[1:06:45] <%watts121> surprised Pat isn't using OP Beastbain sword.
[1:06:46] <+chiazam> KAINE IN HD
[1:06:50] <+yukichocomilk> wish we'd just play the whole game as her instead
[1:06:50] <Laecerelius> You need to protect Weiss's delicate sensibilities!
[1:06:50] <%Ynkubus_> Say the bad words more Kaine
[1:06:52] <nevan_44> LUL

[1:07:41] <%The_Gaming_Karp> This place is one giant OSHA violation
[1:07:41] <%SilvaChariot0133> And nothing of value was lost Kappa
[1:07:42] <T_Sasquatch> So far , all the boss fights ive done felt quite anti climatic imo
[1:07:43] <%JoshManVGH> Probably just a method of focus
[1:07:46] <Djinnazz> @RetroCop87 he is in this.

[1:24:19] <Saltmeisterr> DOPPLEGANGER
[1:24:22] <zenith0111> @itsgundamu Eludes to grander things outside our understanding but gives a meaning besides leaving it open to interpret
[1:24:22] <theguitarlos> 40 year old men can desire friendship too! LOL
[1:24:23] <tattleworm> phantasm's cool as hell
[1:24:24] <%za7az> @cafefunk It's not all bad though, there's even some really great parts :)
[1:24:24] <%EynosStyles> why does face give me Michael Jackson vibes there?
[1:24:30] <+cafefunk> @za7az i guess theres no innate point but points are something we make
[1:24:31] <%AzureGale> @rekinom Also Akihiko Sanada
[1:24:33] <ihavesillyknees> Imagine an over 40+ year old ghoulish man just yelling LETS BE FRIENDS to you
[1:24:43] <%za7az> @cafefunk Bingo
[1:24:45] <Visorak6> yeyeyeyeye
[1:24:47] <$Futurecity10> FACADE RULES
[1:24:47] <Devbob98> The real fun kingdom
[1:24:55] <cardamomo88> papa nier is my best friend
[1:24:58] <Blank9> papa nier is the most valued member of a post apocalyptic society
[1:25:03] <zenith0111> Facade is a vibe
[1:25:07] <pixelkenj> under the house
[1:25:07] <Blank9> he's the only person who has any muscle mass in the entire world
[1:25:08] <%Ranryu692> right under it
[1:25:08] <Daniel_Is_I> Below it I think
[1:25:08] <illtima> How do they not know about the Facade? Their kingdom is like 10 mins on foot away from the village
[1:25:09] <%ssjklyco> Yeah
[1:25:09] <+JustToWatch> under
[1:25:09] <Tracazoid> Yeah
[1:25:16] <+D00msDayDan> the bottom floor
[1:25:17] <%SunnyVarietyPack> yes to my memory
[1:25:19] <$Futurecity10> yes, its right next to it
[1:25:21] <AoiRob> ye
[1:25:21] <%strugglepunk2> it's next to the two houses under the house
[1:25:21] <pixelkenj> The spawn point only shows up sometimes, and then its rarely an egg
[1:25:23] <+DoctorIdiot> is this a remake of nier 1?
[1:25:23] <TheApproachingSnom> yo fuck this village lol
[1:25:25] <%AzureGale> Shouldn't Nier's legs be raw from all that sliding
[1:25:26] <beanpolice> am i the only one who thinks Kaine's face on this one looks a little weird ?
[1:25:27] <%shootbang_exe> facade more like faCHAD
[1:25:27] <%rottingpastry> up
[1:25:27] <Daniel_Is_I> No climb up and over and then down
[1:25:29] <%Monkeyweed21> wrong way
[1:25:31] <$NoHopeForMyCuirass> Nier and Silent Hill 2 are the BEST games at letting the theme continue past the cutscene
[1:25:31] <%RetroCop87> no, dig up
[1:25:32] <%strugglepunk2> you can see if there's an item from that first big platform
[1:25:35] <%NitronStreams> Now we can get the fuck out of this shit hole
[1:25:37] <%strugglepunk2> it's not spawned in
[1:25:40] <zenith0111> @blank9 Great for chasing shadows I mean shades :)
[1:25:42] <Devbob98> Kaine is now trapped following this mad man
[1:25:46] <battlexqueen> Might not have spawned tho
[1:25:49] <%EynosStyles> very dark souls this part
[1:25:50] <godzookylives> Papa Nier is a good guy who doesn't afraid of anything
[1:25:53] <ihavesillyknees> fuck this place let's bail!
[1:25:59] <+LastnameSilverLastname> Man this kid is spry
[1:26:00] <TheApproachingSnom> oof that Kaine AI
[1:26:03] <%strugglepunk2> yeah not spawned
[1:26:06] <Blank9> @AzureGale He's built up a lot of callouses on his knees if nothing else.
[1:26:08] <%bevyrage> spawn point for the eagle egg under the chief's house is rare btw, so it's not guaranteed to be there
[1:26:10] <VidulaSaix> Same
[1:26:13] <%rottingpastry> all niers are good guys
[1:26:13] <%Valdorick> Don't we all
[1:26:15] <%RetroCop87> there's an exploit to speed up eagle egg farming
[1:26:15] <Tracazoid> I would too
[1:26:18] <%toastybites> @TheApproachingSnom do you not climb ladders by dashing into them irl
[1:26:18] <BreakerDS> I miss dog faced Papa Nier
[1:26:20] <Sol_Install> A dlc for Papa nier would be cool
[1:26:23] <+cafefunk> Its impressive how a game with so much grey can still be so beautiful
[1:26:23] <Ninoace> Same
[1:26:26] <%solracc25> it really does look like the robot village
[1:26:27] <SPidERMan8576> i hope they add papa nier dlc
[1:26:29] <+Linconlord> Kaine moves like a Kingdom Hearts party member
[1:26:30] <%strugglepunk2> Man i'd kill to be able do a good jamison price voice
[1:26:31] <%bevyrage> it is but it's a rare spawn
[1:26:32] <ihavesillyknees> Eh, maybe
[1:26:32] <%The_Gaming_Karp> Kaine was in the box!
[1:26:32] <%strugglepunk2> yeah it is
[1:26:32] <%BoxNavy> it is. just didnt spawn
[1:26:32] <%Ranryu692> yeah, no luck this time
[1:26:33] <Laecerelius> Dog Face DLC
[1:26:34] <Daniel_Is_I> It's normally there but maybe it despawned for the fight
[1:26:35] <zenith0111> Aw but it ruins Kaine and protags dynamic BibleThump
[1:26:35] <%NoHopeForMyCuirass> That would be SO much effort
[1:26:36] <%strugglepunk2> didn't spawn in
[1:26:37] <RetroCop87> didn't spawn
[1:26:37] <Sol_Install> it's a rare drop
[1:26:37] <VidulaSaix> If it spawns it's underneath chiefs house
[1:26:37] <cardamomo88> i wanna bishe papa nier
[1:26:38] <pixelkenj> right there yeah
[1:26:42] <+D00msDayDan> that's the spot, it just hasn't spawned because story
[1:26:43] <%Chester_goes_Berserk> not during the boss fight
[1:26:43] <%NitronStreams> They would make so much fucking money with a gestalt dlc
[1:26:46] <ihavesillyknees> they probably wouldn't make dog face Noier
[1:26:49] <%BoxNavy> you have to get a game over for it to respawn
[1:26:51] <+mashinchaserr> dad simulator 2010 dlc
[1:26:52] <pixelkenj> nah you have to game over to re roll your chance
[1:26:53] <%bevyrage> you have to reload the zone to get a chance for it to spawn
[1:26:54] <BreakerDS> His dog face and his dumb barbarian gear
[1:26:54] <twohitgood> when i got it, it was in the open. the map might not spawn it while in boss fight mode.
[1:26:56] <battlexqueen> It doesnt always spawn
[1:26:57] <%RetroCop87> it spawns on game over>continue
[1:26:58] <ihavesillyknees> they would make daddy Nier
[1:27:00] <+JustToWatch> maybe because of the boss fight
[1:27:00] <Halospaz117> gotta leave and come back
[1:27:01] <%rottingpastry> or save and load
[1:27:02] <%AzureGale> what
[1:27:02] <xeros720> game over or leave the zone completely
[1:27:04] <penitentpendant> Bonus points if the patch name is just the SQRT of 1.75
[1:27:04] <VidulaSaix> Or just save and reload the game
[1:27:06] <%RetroCop87> but you start your continue at the chief's house
[1:27:06] <%Ranryu692> @PatStaresAt supposedly reloading the save works too
[1:27:07] <$Futurecity10> @PatStaresAt Or just save, and reload
[1:27:10] <xeros720> actually, you can save and load right?
[1:27:10] <+Caidezes> You can reloead for it to respawn too.
[1:27:10] <AoiRob> leave and reenter
[1:27:11] <ihavesillyknees> Handsome Papa Nier
[1:27:15] <Sol_Install> its not that hard to get a game over
[1:27:16] <%AzureGale> Guess Pat will never get an eagle egg
[1:27:16] <%strugglepunk2> trick for grinding it is to save at the aerie mailbox and then check if it's spawned
[1:27:20] <%strugglepunk2> if not reload
[1:27:20] <Halospaz117> Who the fuck said game over, what's wrong with you?
[1:27:20] <%Alazull> I think you can jump off the side
[1:27:23] <%BoxNavy> yeah it took me like 3 hours to get 4 of them
[1:27:23] <%rumtumtugnutz> Wait, is this the girl who kills you if you perve on her ten times?
[1:27:24] <pixelkenj> yeah but then you have to climb all the way over
[1:27:25] <%strugglepunk2> if it's not an eagle egg, reload
[1:27:28] <%rottingpastry> reloading the save definitely changes the spawns, I have done it
[1:27:28] <Halospaz117> Just leave and come back
[1:27:28] <+JustToWatch> yes
[1:27:29] <$Futurecity10> @PatStaresAt Yes
[1:27:30] <TheApproachingSnom> Papa Nier looking like a Street Shark
[1:27:32] <pixelkenj> from the platform kinda
[1:27:32] <%bevyrage> it also can respawn on save loading and on reloading the zone. and you can see it from the central platform
[1:27:35] <%BoxNavy> yea
[1:27:35] <%strugglepunk2> you can see it from the first big platform
[1:27:36] <+D00msDayDan> yeah you can see the item glow from the entrance
[1:27:39] <zenith0111> Just about
[1:27:40] <%RetroCop87> @PatStaresAt it took me 2 1/2 hours of reloading for four eggs
[1:27:44] <%Monkeyweed21> from the patform
[1:27:44] <%AgniBrandt> It's faster to kill yourself than it is to reload
[1:27:44] <$Futurecity10> @PatStaresAt Took me an hour to get 1 eagle egg, usually the first egg is free.
[1:27:46] <%Alazull> @PatStaresAt Try jumping into the chasm
[1:27:47] <$Garthunox> yes
[1:27:49] <xeros720> maybe not on the ps3, but i hope in this version
[1:27:52] <%Lion_kun> Yes
[1:27:52] <%AzureGale> F
[1:27:55] <pixelkenj> shhhhh
[1:27:58] <%RetroCop87> so I heard
[1:28:00] <illtima> why do you even need the egg?
[1:28:02] <%BoxNavy> wish i knew that moon2W
[1:28:06] <%Ranryu692> I got super lucky and got an egg the first time after getting the quest
[1:28:12] <%strugglepunk2> nah
[1:28:12] <shieldecho> meteorites are easier to farm than fucking eggs
[1:28:14] <xeros720> buy the egg dlc, pat says as he pockets his money
[1:28:17] <pixelkenj> youd have to walk to the platform to see it
[1:28:17] <%RetroCop87> you see it from the circle platform
[1:28:19] <%strugglepunk2> gotta go a bit further
[1:28:24] <+tussletoes> 5% drop chance like before
[1:28:24] <Sol_Install> watch streamer luck
[1:28:26] <%BoxNavy> you can see it from the big circle platform
[1:28:26] <%Ranryu692> @illtima upgrade material for one of the best weapons
[1:28:29] <%rottingpastry> options -> other -> load
[1:28:35] <VidulaSaix> No no you need to reload the game itself
[1:28:35] <+JustToWatch> you need to go a little futher
[1:28:40] <ihavesillyknees> just leave and reload
[1:28:41] <xeros720> oh, that's good to know
[1:28:42] <TheApproachingSnom> DLC specifically for egg
[1:28:44] <+aWanderingKaivo> nice things yes
[1:28:45] <%RetroCop87> you can also farm meteorites from Kaine's place
[1:28:48] <zenith0111> Yoko Taro did say he wanted to make thr game as grindy and monotonous as possible
[1:28:48] <%BoxNavy> monkaS hope not
[1:28:48] <LoganPayne> Nice things like 'fuckface'
[1:28:49] <cardamomo88> oof kid
[1:28:52] <%EynosStyles> oh boy
[1:28:55] <%NitronStreams> Buy the Egg season pass
[1:28:58] <%Maids4lyfe> lmao
[1:28:59] <dinnydanny777> Nier ver.1.22474487139 minutes
[1:29:00] <pixelkenj> sure, Yonah
[1:29:01] <%strugglepunk2> just reload, it's faster
[1:29:02] <Devbob98> The nicest raddest  things
[1:29:04] <xeros720> well, honestly it was some challenge rooms or something right? they just dropped the real pain in the ass crafting mats
[1:29:04] <%Valdorick> Your mom was the most foul mouthed person this side of the Kingdom of Light.
[1:29:08] <ihavesillyknees> Yeah your mom was like Kaine lol
[1:29:11] <%Garthunox> These letters cant be from this time
[1:29:17] <cardamomo88> big bro what is a cum dump
[1:29:18] <VidulaSaix> It may
[1:29:19] <+aWanderingKaivo> "a tome such as myself" I don't know why but that line is great
[1:29:21] <%Cn_alpha_02> That page always cracks me up.
[1:29:21] <ScreamLord> @PatStaresAt Pro Tip: Weapon Switching is unlocked after the midway point of the game and is set at hold to switch. I recommend changing it to tap
[1:29:22] <Mr_JustinJones> I'm guessing there was a problem with the eggs not spawning? I didn't have that luckily
[1:29:28] <pixelkenj> just collection points in this area
[1:29:34] <+D00msDayDan> i picked up a meteorite off the ground in this cave once
[1:29:34] <%RetroCop87> next to her house, it's another spawn
[1:29:45] <ihavesillyknees> what is Pat doing again?
[1:29:51] <%rottingpastry> dark orgasm
[1:29:56] <%rottingpastry> eagle egg
[1:30:04] <%rumtumtugnutz> Kaine has a dope hooking tent.
[1:30:08] <zenith0111> The phantasms charge move isnt the best so do the tap version more often
[1:30:14] <Blank9> it hits everything in the sphere
[1:30:18] <+D00msDayDan> it targets every enemy in that radius
[1:30:28] <Sypheck> it's similar to Mirage in Automata but no invincibility frames here
[1:30:34] <%strugglepunk2> yo that tap move looks kinda good tho
[1:30:38] <theguitarlos> is the combat also remade or is it still the same from the original? Looks more like Automata now
[1:30:39] <%Monkeyweed21> Its the AOE annihilator
[1:30:40] <%solracc25> doppleganger
[1:30:44] <zenith0111> It also keeps your combo meter going
[1:30:46] <tattleworm> try it on the stupid huge crowd of mini shades by the junk heap for a laugh
[1:30:47] <Blank9> if you charge, you see the radius it targets in, and it'll hit everything in it
[1:30:47] <%Garthunox> hold it down
[1:30:49] <%strugglepunk2> if you're locked at least
[1:30:53] <zenith0111> Counts as melee
[1:31:04] <%rottingpastry> combat seems better tbh
[1:31:07] <$Futurecity10> first platform
[1:31:10] <pixelkenj> does the combo meter even do anything
[1:31:15] <$Futurecity10> Yes
[1:31:16] <%strugglepunk2> yep
[1:31:19] <pixelkenj> Yeah
[1:31:21] <twohitgood> yes
[1:31:23] <Sol_Install> yep
[1:31:24] <%rottingpastry> seems pretty glowy
[1:31:24] <amritadyne> if you see a yellow glow from the platform, it's there
[1:31:25] <%BoxNavy> that the area they spawn yeah
[1:31:26] <%RetroCop87> watch it be an ore
[1:31:32] <pixelkenj> now time how long it takes to walk there
[1:31:33] <VidulaSaix> Inb4 trash Jebaited
[1:31:37] <%Garthunox> MAYBE
[1:31:39] <%BoxNavy> i hope its clay :)
[1:31:43] <Devbob98> I hope it’s a bat fang now
[1:31:46] <%Garthunox> it spawned but it might not be the egg
[1:31:46] <%NitronStreams> inb4 crazy talk
[1:31:47] <theguitarlos> @rottingpastry yeah seriously, Nier Automata was my first game and I've been thinking about playing Replicant
[1:31:52] <%strugglepunk2> you actually gonna give the eagle egg to the lady?
[1:31:57] <%BoxNavy> it will be the egg but im just hoping :)
[1:31:58] <%patriotrenegade> Even a broken gamer is right twice a day.

[1:33:23] <%rottingpastry> That's stupid and I love it

[1:34:32] <%Garthunox> Hold down the button for phantasm
[1:34:33] <ihavesillyknees> If you don't use magic for killing sheep then what's the point?
[1:34:41] <zenith0111> Heavy Attacks are kinda purely meant for breaking Guards
[1:34:42] <Ethel9727> "What will you use the incomparable power of Grimoire Weiss for?" "Probably to kill some sheep."

[1:36:48] <+Gespens> I wonder if the game kept the VN section
[1:36:52] <%BoxNavy> dog
[1:36:54] <%solracc25> psaDogchamp
[1:36:56] <%rottingpastry> everything despawns if you stop looking at it for long enough I think
[1:36:56] <ihavesillyknees> no one calls me adorable when I'm fat with my tongue out :(
[1:36:57] <+oda_flobunaga> bullet absorb is epic too
[1:36:59] <Blank9> it kept everything
[1:37:02] <%BoxNavy> @Gespens you bet they did
[1:37:03] <%rottingpastry> @Gespens yes
[1:37:07] <%EynosStyles> does anyone remember what the shades are saying
[1:37:15] <%Alazull> Things despawn fast even if you look at them
[1:37:19] <pixelkenj> kidna
[1:37:20] <%BoxNavy> no reason to remove the VN sections theyre good
[1:37:26] <%BoxNavy> and oh god yeah pats right
[1:37:28] <VidulaSaix> @Gespens Its quite literally the same old game + more
[1:37:28] <Daniel_Is_I> Like a more washed out 3U
[1:37:29] <AtisutoCurry> I miss deserted island in tri
[1:37:35] <%Dakuu75> @EynosStyles "Harder daddy."
[1:37:39] <%rottingpastry> too many suns
[1:37:40] <%ssjklyco> You brought up Monster Hunter in the original LP as well. time repeats itself
[1:37:41] <@commanderclaw> Cause the sun is in a different location
[1:37:43] <AtisutoCurry> you mean the 3ds version

[1:37:50] <ihavesillyknees> Oh god the VN segments uuuuugh
[1:38:05] <%EynosStyles> @dakuu75 if only lol
[1:38:05] <+aWanderingKaivo> did they add a way to quickly switch magic abilities later or something?
[1:38:06] <+D00msDayDan> @LordOfThePoultry it does but pat doesn't have good words yet
[1:38:15] <%bevyrage> probably better when you're able to one-shot guys
[1:38:19] <%RetroCop87> no love for Beastkin?
[1:38:21] <Blank9> tiny charges combo crazy fast
[1:38:26] <VidulaSaix> I didn't mind the VN segments in this one. The stories were at least interesting and didn't feel like a bad anime like some of Automata's did
[1:38:29] <m_ccloud> it doesnt do much damage but i find it good for combos
[1:38:31] <Sain_127> hi mr pat

[1:44:57] <%AzureGale> I can find two melons easily
[1:44:58] <zenith0111> Facade has that
[1:45:01] <%SunnyVarietyPack> this is the only quest I didnt do :(
[1:45:03] <$Futurecity10> @PatStaresAt You need a melon, watermelon, and I think a pumpkin, you can buy the melons in facade
[1:45:15] <%rottingpastry> seafront has melon, facade has the other bullshit
[1:45:25] <+BIumen> buy 11 watermelons :)
[1:45:31] <zenith0111> If you do not care about your farm jus tdump wheat into it
[1:45:38] <%The_Gaming_Karp> I just bought some watermelon
[1:45:57] <Sypheck> yeah Seafront has a lot of bullshit at this point
[1:45:57] <%BoxNavy> man, i did not touch that farm at all
[1:45:58] <pixelkenj> The First couple fishing quests take a bit of time but they get shorter later on
[1:45:59] <%Garthunox> yeah buy 11 watermelons
[1:46:01] <ihavesillyknees> pe-TS Nier looks so dumb. I honestly really couldn't wait for the timeskip
[1:46:03] <%rottingpastry> but did you buy 11 watermelon?
[1:46:14] <T_Sasquatch> Yea... I totally don't care about doing sidequests now LUL i thought they'd be better
[1:46:18] <%Jaxnos> i'm excited for the accidental roll coming
[1:46:22] <%Monkeyweed21> @ihavesillyknees you can dress him like nines
[1:46:28] <%rottingpastry> what about jump? can jump?
[1:46:30] <xeros720> can't get hit either, so be careful of the everything
[1:46:33] <%RetroCop87> don't jump super high either
[1:46:36] <%EynosStyles> don't fight
[1:46:37] <penitentpendant> Hyaah! ~Link Probably
[1:46:37] <pixelkenj> Main Menu
[1:46:40] <%Jaxnos> you can change em from the main menu
[1:46:40] <Sypheck> you should be able to in the title screen iirc
[1:46:40] <%BoxNavy> you do it at the title screen
[1:46:40] <Djinnazz> main menu
[1:46:41] <m_ccloud> you already can
[1:46:41] <T_Sasquatch> Yes you can jump
[1:46:41] <%SunnyVarietyPack> you can from the main menu
[1:46:43] <%Jaxnos> title screen
[1:46:43] <%RetroCop87> you can select costumes from the main menu's options
[1:46:43] <B1G_DADDY_ADAM> you can from main menu
[1:46:44] <Mr_JustinJones> you can i think
[1:46:44] <soflicar> route B
[1:46:45] <+aWanderingKaivo> how's the farm work this time around? I remember on 360 you'd do the ole change the console's timezone trick
[1:46:46] <lemon_lover28> if you have the DLC at any time I believe
[1:46:47] <Laecerelius> You know what will make this go faster, Pat?  Rolling
[1:46:48] <ihavesillyknees> @monkeyweed21 I didnt find the costume change thing
[1:46:49] <Visorak6> Trying to catch you SLEEPIN
[1:46:49] <pixelkenj> I just found out today you have to back out
[1:46:50] <AoiRob> fuck it just unequip the roll
[1:46:53] <Nupinoop296> HUSSY??
[1:46:59] <%The_Gaming_Karp> Kaine that hussey!
[1:47:01] <zenith0111> Youll be able to fight that big dude soon
[1:47:01] <dinnydanny777> Hussi
[1:47:04] <%SunnyVarietyPack> baby nier looks good in 9s outfit
[1:47:05] <pixelkenj> you can ride the boar for fragile quests as long as you dont crash it
[1:47:05] <iosephe> I love Kaine
[1:47:07] <zenith0111> Like a level or two
[1:47:09] <ihavesillyknees> Weiss the puritan
[1:47:10] <%greasypete00> HE STILL CALLS HER A HUSSY
[1:47:12] <%rottingpastry> Kaine is the best hussy in hussydom
[1:47:15] <tattleworm> oh wow, i just realised tapping phantasm in the air sends out a ranged helmsplitter
[1:47:20] <%EynosStyles> where is the gang?
[1:47:21] <lemon_lover28> I hate nines outfit
[1:47:22] <ItsPastas> @aWanderingKaivo time travel still works, except in ps4 where you gotta change timezones
[1:47:24] <ihavesillyknees> Kaine gives no shits
[1:47:26] <Ethel9727> Yeah, the 9ss outfit looks better than young NieR's original outfit imo
[1:47:29] <%Jaxnos> true, you could unequip the roll for these quests and never make goof. but where's the fun in that?
[1:47:42] <AoiRob> @tattleworm and phantasm mid-combo does high time
[1:47:48] <ihavesillyknees> @ethel9727 That's true but tbh that's not a huge a achievement
[1:47:49] <Visorak6> This brings to mind shit like witcher 3 where running too fast/off course can end dialogue prematurely and boy I'm glad that's not a problem here
[1:47:49] <%rottingpastry> wepon
[1:47:52] <zenith0111> @tattleworm Tap versions can be the strongest. Like Dark Blast Mashing R1 is OP
[1:47:54] <anuchallengertwitch> I like the dialogue. It's endearing how casual it feels sometimes
[1:47:59] <%neroforte177> did they ever explain why Kaine is in her underwear or why she cusses like a sailor @chat ?
[1:48:00] <%rottingpastry> oh wepon is facade o no i dumb
[1:48:04] <%rottingpastry> next to pier
[1:48:11] <zenith0111> @neroforte177 Later
[1:48:12] <ihavesillyknees> sexism!!!
[1:48:13] <Sypheck> keep going straight down
[1:48:14] <tattleworm> @tattleworm that's amazing
[1:48:18] <%RetroCop87> Don't be hating Yukari
[1:48:27] <AoiRob> in front of the pier
[1:48:28] <%neroforte177> @ihavesillyknees thats fine
[1:48:29] <%rottingpastry> now roll as a troll
[1:48:31] <VidulaSaix> @neroforte177 Yes its expanded upon later

[1:49:27] <%BoxNavy> just pick up a mouse and yank its tail off
[1:49:28] <Nupinoop296> if you're brave enough to drink that you're brave enough to sing in public
[1:49:32] <tattleworm> she's built different
[1:49:33] <Daniel_Is_I> Look Popola needs it strong.

[1:49:45] <korlege> popola is the real freak
[1:49:46] <Ethel9727> The thing that is terrifying is that the drink isn't named after Popola ergo it probably existed before her
[1:49:53] <LordOfThePoultry> get to it pat LUL
[1:49:54] <%SunnyVarietyPack> I hated this
[1:49:54] <%rottingpastry> lol
[1:49:56] <Daniel_Is_I> RUN FROM THE FISHING PRISON
[1:49:57] <%BoxNavy> but the secret pat D:
[1:49:57] <Sain_127> whats wrong kid :)
[1:49:58] <ihavesillyknees> The rat tail has that extra kick!
[1:50:01] <$Futurecity10> fishing is how you make boku bucks in this game
[1:50:02] <pixelkenj> he asks for less fish later but these first ones take a while
[1:50:02] <Zebroneath> sounds like a job for off-screen Pat
[1:50:02] <%linSP> FISH
[1:50:03] <%bevyrage> just buy 10 of 'em
[1:50:05] <LoganPayne> And this is where I remembered that Automata's sidequests were infinitely better
[1:50:07] <cardamomo88> sardines are easy to cacth
[1:50:08] <Sain_127> you're gonna lose to a fish? :)
[1:50:08] <%neroforte177> @chat grandted this is written by a guy who when asked why he gave robots phat asses his reply was cuz i can so...
[1:50:09] <%rottingpastry> it's not the worst, but yes, the "catch x fish" quests are ass
[1:50:09] <%metalicblackcherry> chill fish stream incoming
[1:50:10] <+CursedNobleman> NTR
[1:50:13] <twohitgood> fishing is easy
[1:50:13] <ihavesillyknees> SO SAD
[1:50:13] <Nupinoop296> rip
[1:50:14] <%BoxNavy> owned
[1:50:16] <IamGrapes> catch the sardines you coward
[1:50:17] <%RetroCop87> that's rough buddy
[1:50:18] <iosephe> what a tier 3 sub
[1:50:19] <zenith0111> LUL
[1:50:19] <%rottingpastry> you can't buy sardines until you finish the quest looool
[1:50:20] <%Shady_Squid> woah thats rough
[1:50:20] <+SavageMonkeyDonger> fishing is fun :)
[1:50:20] <%cvp5127> thats rough buddy
[1:50:21] <%EynosStyles> You can't buy love dude
[1:50:22] <dinnydanny777> Oh no, not his pocket book NotLikeThis
[1:50:23] <%Monkeyweed21> Remember, Devola is a messy alcoholic, but Popola is a violent drunk which is why she doesnt drink
[1:50:23] <%SaiyanShoto> cucked
[1:50:26] <twohitgood> just go opposite where the fish is and follow the strength of the controller vibration.
[1:50:35] <+mashinchaserr> :/
[1:50:37] <VidulaSaix> S A R D I N E S
[1:50:43] <Sain_127> DUDE
[1:50:44] <Mr_JustinJones> Kinda getting sick of the fetch quests
[1:50:47] <Daniel_Is_I> Have fun catching 20 fucking sardines
[1:50:48] <Laecerelius> Time to fish!
[1:50:49] <%maskofmichael> 10 bags of weed?
[1:50:49] <ihavesillyknees> Uuuugg fetch quest
[1:50:51] <Sypheck> the sardine combos
[1:50:52] <Nupinoop296> now you have a reason to get sardines
[1:50:52] <%rottingpastry> warning: fisherman takes the sardines, so you actually need 20
[1:50:56] <ihavesillyknees> this is why I just went fuck it
[1:50:58] <+kawachipto> I heard 10 bags of weed
[1:50:58] <dinnydanny777> I'm surprised sardines still exist in the future
[1:50:59] <xeros720> and now the stream became sardine fishing
[1:51:03] <Parapattern> Medicine sardine bread. My favorite
[1:51:03] <AoiRob> time to catch a million sardines
[1:51:04] <Nupinoop296> uh. keep what hidden forever
[1:51:07] <%wibbwobbler> dude can't find 10 sardines
[1:51:08] <LoganPayne> I hef 12 matchstick
[1:51:08] <VidulaSaix> Just catch one and buy the rest from the shop Jebaited
[1:51:11] <tattleworm> if you catch 10 and give them to the fisherman, you can buy sardines after that @PatStaresAt
[1:51:12] <+JustToWatch> 20 SARDINES WOOOO
[1:51:13] <pixelkenj> postman
[1:51:23] <+BIumen> @PatStaresAt once you do it for the old man the sardines are in the stores
[1:51:26] <%maybefalco> if you do the first fishing quest you can buy them from the fish stall afterwards
[1:51:27] <%Monkeyweed21> postman
[1:51:40] <ihavesillyknees> Is there any interesting sidequests in this game?
[1:51:40] <Daniel_Is_I> I'm playing on PC so I was able to just cheat in the materials
[1:51:40] <godzookylives> i thought he said ten bags of weed
[1:51:41] <%ssjklyco> Sardines on crackers are great
[1:51:44] <%SaiyanShoto> After catching a sardine don't you unlock them to buy? Or do you have to beat the fisherman quest to buy them?
[1:51:48] <pixelkenj> Its shocking how fast you can go through the game if you ignore sidequests
[1:51:50] <%BoxNavy> chat can you get black pearls in part 1?
[1:51:50] <AoiRob> and a later quest needs fish that use sardine as bait so even more sardine catching to do
[1:51:51] <%bevyrage> how DARE you deny us the NieR experience pat
[1:51:51] <zenith0111> Fishing Quest is so you can get some good cash
[1:51:53] <Devbob98> Pad for time quests
[1:51:55] <VidulaSaix> Lighthouse lady is really the only on camera sidequest really. The rest are easy off screen stuff
[1:51:57] <%bevyrage> fish for sardines or NO BALLS
[1:52:03] <%Monkeyweed21> @PatStaresAt did anyone send you the Nier sidequest flowchart?
[1:52:09] <%rottingpastry> I'm am! I'm high af!
[1:52:12] <%SunnyVarietyPack> save the devola and yonah one for on screen
[1:52:26] <zenith0111> Nier is the grind. I compare it to Harvest Moon or AC at times LUL
[1:52:26] <Sypheck> I'm still kinda surprised that none of this fetch quest bullshit was streamlined at all LUL
[1:52:27] <pixelkenj> anything involving the aerie = uh oh
[1:52:28] <%Chester_goes_Berserk> Lighthouse lady sidequest is a huge high point
[1:52:28] <VidulaSaix> Why the fuck would anyone need a flow chart for sidequest. Just do them when you see them LUL
[1:52:30] <ihavesillyknees> I think Devola and Popola one is the only sidequests in curious about
[1:52:36] <LoganPayne> ...oh...from the Aerie huh
[1:52:36] <%RetroCop87> "the only problem is she's from the Aerie"
[1:52:40] <%rottingpastry> the only shit quest that hurts is the flower breeding quest
[1:52:46] <%EynosStyles> wow. love is blind lol
[1:52:47] <+BIumen> wow i bet she's alive
[1:52:56] <AoiRob> the first half of the game is like 5 hours without the sidequests
[1:52:58] <%rottingpastry> Yeah, my girlfriend who lives in Canada
[1:53:12] <Devbob98> This Pokémon now
[1:53:12] <%RetroCop87> why was that girl just styling on us!?
[1:53:13] <tattleworm> devopopo and lighthouse lady sidequests are premium content
[1:53:15] <Visorak6> Oh right cant you straight up grow them
[1:53:18] <zenith0111> @rottingpastry Thank god Ive been doing that ever since I got the farm. I just got the Pink Moonflowers today
[1:53:19] <shieldecho> BOY DO THEY
[1:53:23] <cardamomo88> i totally have one
[1:53:24] <%Garthunox> might get another egg
[1:53:37] <+skyheys> boy does it...
[1:53:41] <%Monkeyweed21> bounty
[1:53:44] <%Garthunox> YEAH
[1:53:46] <shieldecho> Also you'll need ten pink moonflower seeds for a sidequest
[1:53:48] <%Garthunox> IT FUCKING DOES!
[1:54:04] <%psidefx> melon]
[1:54:07] <%Monkeyweed21> MELON
[1:54:09] <%rottingpastry> I did not start the flower growing, it is going to suck I might cheat
[1:54:13] <Devbob98> Melon gone
[1:54:16] <shieldecho> It does not take as long to grow flowers anymore though, which is nice
[1:54:25] <zenith0111> Theres a farmijg exploit trick but you can just casually do it throughout the whole playthrough so youre not just grinding flowers
[1:54:30] <%BoxNavy> MELON!
[1:54:31] <%trekkie11041> Bye melon
[1:54:34] <+Birdigalore> MELON!  You son of a bitch!
[1:54:34] <%rottingpastry> melon running
[1:54:35] <VidulaSaix> Flowers grow quick now yeah but its still a pain
[1:54:36] <ihavesillyknees> just went through the option. Kaine looks great with the Yorha putfit
[1:54:38] <shieldecho> Like I think in the original game it took three days or something just to grow a flower, now it's overnight
[1:54:40] <tattleworm> she's in demon mode
[1:54:41] <%cvp5127> buy one of everything at each store
[1:54:41] <IamGrapes> MYELON
[1:54:42] <InugamiTheHound> Kaine does the naruto run LOL
[1:54:48] <%rottingpastry> carrot store
[1:54:48] <%RetroCop87> And Emil runs like Shadow the Hedgehog
[1:54:49] <Devbob98> But she makes it look cool
[1:54:50] <lemon_lover28> the naruto run is the real reason the villagers hate her
[1:54:54] <pixelkenj> did you do the postman quest?
[1:54:54] <%Garthunox> @zenith0111 you mean adjusting the system clock? cos that doesnt work anymore
[1:54:54] <dinnydanny777> Would you tell Kaine to stop Naruto running? I wouldn't.
[1:54:56] <%linSP> there at the fruit store
[1:54:59] <VidulaSaix> Grab a Pumpkin too for a quest later @PatStaresAt
[1:55:02] <%Monkeyweed21> @PatStaresAt Does Kaine use a macro with her limit break or her trick attack?
[1:55:02] <Ultimatefool> M' ELON
[1:55:05] <$Skittlesoul> !uptime
[1:55:05] <@Moobot> @Skittlesoul I've been playing this game for how long? Oh only 1h 55m.
[1:55:06] <%EynosStyles> wait isn't Kaine before Naruto.
[1:55:08] <Sypheck> the merchant with melons on display LUL
[1:55:10] <pixelkenj> icon with the carrot
[1:55:12] <zenith0111> @garthunox Timezone change is the new tech
[1:55:13] <ihavesillyknees> The Village is a HuntsrXHunter only fans
[1:55:26] <%rottingpastry> tiny carrot
[1:55:33] <%Garthunox> @zenith0111 ye, just didnt know if you knew, it still sucks tho
[1:55:35] <+D00msDayDan> buy 5 rice too
[1:55:36] <T_Sasquatch> @monkeyweed21 why macro a limit break ??
[1:55:39] <tattleworm> pumpkins are from facade
[1:55:39] <%The_Gaming_Karp> expensive melon
[1:55:40] <%linSP> they clearly have watermelons at the stand, but theyre not selling them
[1:55:43] <%rottingpastry> pumpkin and watermelon are in mask nerd land
[1:55:47] <%RetroCop87> Why are the melons more expensive than watermelons?
[1:55:48] <%The_Gaming_Karp> it's one of those Japanese watermelons
[1:55:50] <tattleworm> to encourage you to grow them
[1:55:55] <%Monkeyweed21> @T_Sasquatch weebs and edgelords
[1:55:57] <Parapattern> Expensive square Japanese melon
[1:56:01] <pixelkenj> melon is fragile dont roll
[1:56:04] <+oktavia_von> must be one of them fancy melons
[1:56:09] <%The_Gaming_Karp> Gift melons
[1:56:10] <ihavesillyknees> Japanese Watermelons are great
[1:56:16] <%BestTeaMaker> @RetroCop87 musk melons are a delicacy and are expensive
[1:56:18] <zenith0111> @garthunox I didnt do anything like that tho and just did it as soon as I got the farm and I already got the pink seeds so im pretty much just waiting for them to die now :P
[1:56:20] <Nupinoop296> just leave Kaine behind as you sprint on your boar
[1:56:23] <InugamiTheHound> man brother's outfit before the time skip is so bad and ugly
[1:56:26] <%The_Gaming_Karp> More foods should be cubic.
[1:56:27] <%Monkeyweed21> @PatStaresAt whats Kaine's Trick Attack macro sound like?
[1:56:28] <tattleworm> not enough drifting
[1:56:29] <%rottingpastry> the boar is approaching plaid
[1:56:34] <ihavesillyknees> Kaine is a huge weeb
[1:56:40] <+RealPT1> that run looks like a god hand run
[1:56:42] <%rottingpastry> I love how when you crash kaine instantly appears and stands over you like, "Hah, fuckin idiot!"
[1:56:46] <%linSP> permanent boarain damage
[1:56:49] <ihavesillyknees> The Boar sidequests is okay because you get a mount
[1:56:49] <VidulaSaix> Young Niers outfit keeps making me think hes Alphinaud from behind because of the colors and his white hair LUL
[1:56:51] <+RealPT1> I love it
[1:57:04] <zenith0111> Farm is best when you do it as soon as you unlock it otherwise its PAIN
[1:57:23] <%bevyrage> your field is where you can plant seeds next to the house
[1:57:25] <Devbob98> Become a farmer
[1:57:27] <tattleworm> 15 slots, grow some lunar tear
[1:57:27] <ihavesillyknees> YOU WANT FLOWERS

[1:57:38] <%Wallabri> plant some plants, pat
[1:57:39] <%SunnyVarietyPack> you have a farm next to your house
[1:57:39] <%EynosStyles> I wish they gave Kaine a Scottish accent to drive home her cussing.
[1:57:39] <twohitgood> you don't need to do the farming for the lunar tear anymore.
[1:57:40] <%RetroCop87> Nier is a farming sim
[1:57:40] <%rottingpastry> you make the flowers fuck to get a quest thing
[1:57:41] <%Maids4lyfe> there's a farm
[1:57:42] <+D00msDayDan> gotta grow that lunar tear
[1:57:42] <%linSP> i tried planting watermelons in my garden as soon as possible and they didnt pop until part 2
[1:57:42] <dan_g_v> grow plants
[1:57:45] <%Monkeyweed21> @PatStaresAt you can grow flowers and shit and maybe get a Lunar Tear
[1:57:45] <%ssjklyco> The april fools joke was real
[1:57:46] <%Chester_goes_Berserk> You need it to complete the worst sidequest in the game
[1:57:46] <tattleworm> there's an achievement, also money
[1:57:47] <Devbob98> It’s fun
[1:57:48] <InugamiTheHound> farming is for money and achievements back on the 360
[1:57:50] <ihavesillyknees> Cause flowers are pwetty
[1:57:52] <%rottingpastry> also cheevo for making a lunar tear
[1:57:54] <zenith0111> More healing items and the best healing items
[1:57:55] <%bread_assassin> Some sidequests make ya grow stuff.
[1:57:57] <$Futurecity10> @PatStaresAt To complete 1 quest and 1 cheevo, you have to cultivate a lunar tear and 10 pink seeds for a quest. it takes literally a week if you're lucky
[1:57:58] <cardamomo88> because fun
[1:58:01] <twohitgood> achievo for lunar tear.
[1:58:06] <shieldecho> Need pink seeds for sidequest
[1:58:08] <%rottingpastry> no one, but a quest does require pink seeds
[1:58:08] <+mashinchaserr> big flower go happy
[1:58:09] <twohitgood> oo sunny day
[1:58:10] <%Garthunox> there's a quest related to cross breeding flowers, and a trophy for growing a lunar tear
[1:58:10] <xeros720> they are also worth a shitload of money
[1:58:11] <Devbob98> Why would you fish?
[1:58:12] <+D00msDayDan> there's a sidequest that needs 10 pink moonflower seeds
[1:58:13] <twohitgood> fresh farming time.
[1:58:14] <tattleworm> get that gamerscore
[1:58:16] <B1G_DADDY_ADAM> can sell them for 5000
[1:58:17] <VidulaSaix> Yep its the only sidequest I havent done cause fuck gardening
[1:58:18] <zenith0111> Moonflowers = More Healing Supplies
[1:58:23] <%The_Gaming_Karp> Those riding animations are... hm
[1:58:24] <zenith0111> Food = Money
[1:58:25] <+tetraes> @PatStaresAt  you need it for a sidequest i believe
[1:58:26] <ihavesillyknees> I never touched the farming like... who cares?
[1:58:28] <shieldecho> Also can sell flowers for money, and money can be used to purchase goods and services
[1:58:28] <amritadyne> you need to do farming to complete a quest for 10 pink seeds too
[1:58:34] <twohitgood> i find it kinda funny that the world has a sunny/cloudy cycle instead of a day/night cycle.
[1:58:36] <VidulaSaix> Nope
[1:58:36] <Deimos002> Number go up tho?
[1:58:36] <+skyheys> says the guy who farms for content in FF14
[1:58:37] <%linSP> what youre not doing the speed run achievement? beat the game in 12 hours!
[1:58:44] <%Monkeyweed21> @PatStaresAt the Lunar Tear is the best sellable in the game
[1:58:53] <%rottingpastry> it is interesting that the mind goblins do not affect this game
[1:58:58] <ihavesillyknees> Not worth it
[1:58:59] <%R3Roundabout> 10k gold for quest
[1:58:59] <%cvp5127> do you need to level up weapon for ending or just have them
[1:59:01] <Daniel_Is_I> I don't think any sidequests give weapons in part 1.
[1:59:01] <InugamiTheHound> The Arie sucks ass. I hate this place
[1:59:02] <zenith0111> It does give you another ending doing all side quests I believe?
[1:59:02] <olaksi> it's single player RPG, why does money matter
[1:59:13] <%The_Gaming_Karp> Can we never come to this awful town again?
[1:59:13] <%bevyrage> i think the mind goblins don't affect this game because pat already played it
[1:59:15] <+CursedNobleman> i love this theme
[1:59:17] <Parapattern> Money can be exchanged for goods and services.
[1:59:19] <%Garthunox> @Monkeyweed21 nope, its so hard to get its not worth it to try and farm it for selling
[1:59:19] <ihavesillyknees> I'm with Pat on this one.
[1:59:20] <lemon_lover28> but harvest moon is great
[1:59:23] <+cafefunk> I miss the adventure of single player games, all ive been playing is sfv and genshin
[1:59:23] <xeros720> tbh, you only need that much money if you max upgrade all weapons, you just need the weapons to see all the endings
[1:59:23] <Devbob98> Hot take
[1:59:24] <%trekkie11041> It’s also more healing items
[1:59:25] <%rottingpastry> technically you can fuck off during the forest quest
[1:59:26] <+D00msDayDan> no argument there
[1:59:30] <+Ropcord> AngelThump
[1:59:31] <+skyheys> oh I see, its "garden bad"
[1:59:33] <%RetroCop87> There are people in this chat who are super rustled about your dismisal
[1:59:33] <%R3Roundabout> I just did it in 2o minutes by changing my clock on PC
[1:59:34] <ihavesillyknees> Hellyea
[1:59:35] <%RetroCop87> keep it up
[1:59:35] <%ssjklyco> The gardening goes off of real world time , so don't bother
[1:59:41] <pixelkenj> phew
[1:59:50] <%rottingpastry> no, I NEED it
[1:59:50] <Ethel9727> Automata was the one with the max upgrade all weapons stuff
[1:59:57] <Tracazoid> Yeah but completionist
[1:59:58] <VidulaSaix> @ssjklyco Nah they definitely sped it up. My stuff grows in a few hours
[2:00:04] <dinnydanny777> a whole village of people who suck limesHmm
[2:00:07] <Daniel_Is_I> Can't even set the system clock forward anymore
[2:00:09] <%rottingpastry> it does seem faster
[2:00:12] <pixelkenj> you can abuse the planting time by changing your timezones but that only saves 24 of the 48 hours needed
[2:00:13] <InugamiTheHound> man I'm not use to brother's Nier voice yet.
[2:00:19] <%RetroCop87> is it?
[2:00:23] <%NoHopeForMyCuirass> Oh it gets worse
[2:00:33] <%rottingpastry> hey remember that guy you didn't fight lol
[2:00:33] <ihavesillyknees> @inugamithehound It gets better later on
[2:00:34] <+D00msDayDan> @pixelkenj that's what i've been hearing about for consoles but can't you go all the way with it on pc?
[2:00:35] <Nupinoop296> i love this music so much
[2:00:40] <+Ropcord> that's the nier experience
[2:00:55] <pixelkenj> PC is fine as long as its not online or something
[2:00:56] <ihavesillyknees> Isn't this the one shot fucker?
[2:01:00] <zenith0111> I already got my Pink Moonflowers so now I can attempt Lunar Tears
[2:01:08] <%linSP> did anyone else have trouble on the titty boss here on hard
[2:01:13] <VidulaSaix> Nothing will one shot you unless you're on hard
[2:01:35] <T_Sasquatch> @linsp hard simply isn't worth it t all
[2:01:40] <zenith0111> Head or Hands
[2:01:47] <InugamiTheHound> so you can move the ingame clock by changing a time zone? That's new for this version
[2:01:50] <%rottingpastry> I think the game expects you to always use dark blast tbh
[2:01:53] <ihavesillyknees> One of these guys one shot me and I was on normal
[2:01:57] <penitentpendant> Fancy Finish
[2:02:03] <%linSP> ooh rare drop
[2:02:03] <ihavesillyknees> It was near the beach
[2:02:04] <+skyheys> lmao
[2:02:08] <shieldecho> ...
[2:02:11] <pixelkenj> y-yeah
[2:02:11] <%Jaxnos> maaaaaybe
[2:02:12] <LordOfThePoultry> oh FeelsBadMan
[2:02:12] <zenith0111> Rare Drop PogU
[2:02:12] <Sol_Install> YEP
[2:02:16] <+D00msDayDan> @InugamiTheHound yeah it's new for this version, in the original you could just set your system date
[2:02:18] <Daniel_Is_I> These shades are a menace to society!
[2:02:19] <xeros720> time to let her husband know!
[2:02:21] <%AzureGale> BUM BUM
[2:02:22] <Devbob98> Def that for sure
[2:02:28] <cardamomo88> well time to find a new one
[2:02:28] <VidulaSaix> @T_Sasquatch I disagree purely because at a certain point I think Normal becomes a bit too faceroll with how strong you get. Although the 15 DLC things get a bit stupid on Hard if you're not sufficiently leveled
[2:02:35] <Devbob98> Hey dude, killed your wife. Sorry
[2:02:37] <B1G_DADDY_ADAM> girlfriend was a shade the whole time, he's just into tall women
[2:02:39] <OswaldTheDog> pain
[2:02:47] <Mattais88> covered in mustard
[2:02:52] <xeros720> that shade must've attacked paige
[2:02:55] <Mr_JustinJones> "what a relief"
[2:02:55] <%RetroCop87> "Paige got to this skull"
[2:03:00] <cardamomo88> so dude i know this twins
[2:03:02] <ihavesillyknees> Wife killing is lmao
[2:03:06] <%Monkeyweed21> oozing with pickle juice
[2:03:08] <%ElkRiverDog> So in LoF, freesia means “trust”
[2:03:10] <+cafefunk> Yeah there has to be a mustard bottle involved
[2:03:11] <ammobasket> That shade was on its way to his girlfriend!
[2:03:18] <lemon_lover28> oh hey there pop in Kaine
[2:03:27] <%EynosStyles> if it drop a papyrus erotic fanfic
[2:03:28] <%RetroCop87> you'll gain a couple in Facade
[2:03:31] <%rottingpastry> it takes a while
[2:03:32] <zenith0111> They want you to use EXP boosts and GRIND
[2:03:40] <%rottingpastry> creepy kaine
[2:03:41] <zenith0111> Everything goes back to big grind in this game
[2:03:48] <+D00msDayDan> i saw a clip of kaine getting sent to orbit by a sheep it was hilarious
[2:03:48] <T_Sasquatch> @vidulasaix normal is absolutely a face roll but hard is also a faceroll that takes two times as long and tanky enemies
[2:03:50] <Devbob98> She’s fast
[2:03:54] <%Jaxnos> i got the exp rate word early on and kept it on
[2:03:54] <VidulaSaix> Nah you dont need to grind
[2:03:58] <%templar010> @PatStaresAt So how has this been so far compared to the original? Is kidNier an acceptable replacement for Lucky Ted?
[2:03:59] <pixelkenj> Plant your seeds at -11 UTC, save then change it to +11 UTC and reload for grown crops (flower seeds needs 48 hours though)
[2:04:07] <lemon_lover28> I didn't remember how much of this game was running back and forth doing fetch quests
[2:04:16] <%Monkeyweed21> Nier is really good about making sure its hard to get overleveled
[2:04:23] <ihavesillyknees> It's fine.
[2:04:23] <%bevyrage> a lot of it lemon, a lot of it
[2:04:24] <InugamiTheHound> what is everyone's favorite sealed verse spell? I like Dark Phantasm
[2:04:26] <%AzureGale> But those shorts tho
[2:04:28] <%rottingpastry> baby nier makes a billion times more sense for the act transition
[2:04:28] <$Futurecity10> adult kid nier is better thank twink nier
[2:04:31] <FennecZephyr> Honestly, kid nier fits way better than old man nier
[2:04:37] <penitentpendant> "Better but Faithful"
[2:04:41] <VidulaSaix> Everyone loves Papa. I'm keen to know how well this is selling cause Yoko did say if this sold well we might get him
[2:04:42] <zenith0111> @lemon_lover28 That's what Yoko Taro wanted
[2:04:43] <Ethel9727> Huge thank you to whoever pointed out the triple helmsplitter trick, it makes boss shades soooo much easier
[2:04:45] <ihavesillyknees> @futurecity10 Which one
[2:04:53] <peyodogo> it's been fun watching em
[2:04:56] <xeros720> only real way to get real powerful is weapon upgrading and that is its own kettle of fish
[2:04:59] <olaksi> kid nier is more tropey
[2:05:03] <%linSP> get him kaine!
[2:05:05] <%RetroCop87> this guy can drop nice words
[2:05:07] <Warbot40> did they add any major stuff?
[2:05:11] <Mr_JustinJones> he'll give you many levels
[2:05:12] <%JoshManVGH> Yeah. it helps to have a crowd to chat with while the sadness happens on screen.
[2:05:17] <AoiRob> parry his ass
[2:05:19] <Meltgar> GRINDING OFF SCREEN? Kappa
[2:05:20] <ihavesillyknees> I like ts bro Nier better than pre TS
[2:05:24] <%rottingpastry> he can 2 or 3 shot kaine it's hilarious
[2:05:28] <shieldecho> It's a fun distraction from the slowly encroaching pain from my first vaccine shot kicking in
[2:05:29] <penitentpendant> @Warbot40 Yes, a lot actually
[2:05:33] <+cafefunk> This game has nice music, cool characters, and its nice just hanging with you, Pat
[2:05:33] <%Chester_goes_Berserk> big recommend to still do lighthouse lady onscreen, it super good
[2:05:37] <AoiRob> YEYEYEE
[2:05:41] <%linSP> i tried killing this dude as soon as early as possible, took an hour and it wasnt worth it
[2:05:48] <%RetroCop87> second swallow shade
[2:05:51] <ihavesillyknees> I like TS Bro Nier better than Dad Nier, however, I like Dad Nier better than pre-TS Brother Nier
[2:05:53] <VidulaSaix> Same
[2:05:59] <AoiRob> use a defense item or smth
[2:06:04] <vampirate1> Last time I was here, you tried to fight this guy and he oneshot you. Let's see it happen again!
[2:06:05] <olaksi> the VA performance post timeskip seems way better the little I heard yeah
[2:06:15] <+TreeeFOX> can you play this with the dad skin?
[2:06:20] <penitentpendant> I mean, this is the time for it
[2:06:26] <lemon_lover28> @zenith0111 I don't necessarily hate the back and forth but I also don't think directorial intent automatically justifies bad design choices (not that I think it is)
[2:06:27] <%Jaxnos> mmmm
[2:06:27] <%rottingpastry> what if you need it for a boss?!
[2:06:28] <zenith0111> Dad Nier pre-TS was a whimp and can only use small swords with his big arms
[2:06:31] <%linSP> thats a good word though
[2:06:33] <shieldecho> *slow clap*
[2:06:34] <%Jaxnos> mp recovery go big up
[2:06:34] <VidulaSaix> @ihavesillyknees I'd invert that actually. I actually had young Nier grow on me. Adult Nier feels like a weirdo that didn't mentally age
[2:06:35] <penitentpendant> "Shoes" acquired
[2:06:35] <Laecerelius> Nice
[2:06:38] <tattleworm> yo put paralyse on dark blast
[2:06:47] <%AzureGale> WORD UP
[2:06:50] <%linSP> word up
[2:06:59] <AoiRob> why not use them? you can just stock up at shops
[2:07:01] <dinnydanny777> Bird is the word up
[2:07:01] <+axenred> @zenith0111 pre-TS papa nier needed the arm strength to hold his daughter
[2:07:05] <%Monkeyweed21> martail arts
[2:07:10] <ihavesillyknees> @vidulasaix Disagree to be honest, I think he changed significantly but I'm not going to spoiler
[2:07:11] <twohitgood> it was a martial art move, wasn't it?
[2:07:12] <iosephe> Maybe it isn't
[2:07:22] <Warbot40> @penitentpendant like dungeons? bosses? Already finished this and not sure if I'd be willing to double dip.
[2:07:32] <xeros720> it's a good word, but not "bird"
[2:07:32] <%rottingpastry> have you tried using the words bofa and deez?
[2:07:39] <zenith0111> @lemon_lover28 Yeah thats understandable
[2:07:46] <InugamiTheHound> @zenith0111 yeah he can only use one handed swords but after the time skip he can use one handed sword,spears(best weapon) and two handed swords
[2:07:47] <ihavesillyknees> Plus isn't the reason people love Papa Nier is because he came across as a manchild?
[2:07:53] <%cvp5127> why isnt pat using the 2b sword
[2:08:02] <twohitgood> did you get the 100 sheep achievement yet?
[2:08:04] <vampirate1> @rottingpastry those only have like a 2% drop chance if it's 4/20 though
[2:08:12] <yourwebgod> Your streams are so chill, glad I found you on twitter
[2:08:24] <tattleworm> yorha swords have ridiculous range for some reason, way longer than the sword's hitbox
[2:08:26] <pixelkenj> @PatStaresAt the yorha swords attack basically doubles if you upgrade it even once
[2:08:32] <+AngriestAngryArtist> ...chill...so far :P
[2:08:33] <penitentpendant> @Warbot40 Let me make sure I'm not getting context wrong: This compared to the original Gestalt/Replicant?
[2:08:35] <zenith0111> @inugamithehound But for me it made no sense what changed for him to do that. But bro nier it actually has a justification
[2:08:40] <VidulaSaix> @ihavesillyknees I don't think he didn't change, I just think that he changed in a backwards fashion as opposed to forward
[2:08:40] <ihavesillyknees> @yourwebgod The stories we can tell you
[2:08:44] <%Chester_goes_Berserk> big chill
[2:08:52] <yourwebgod> @ihavesillyknees, LUL
[2:08:54] <%AzureGale> F
[2:08:55] <Nupinoop296> oh no
[2:08:58] <olaksi> My favorite bad-take is hat Papa-nier character development during TS is dumb because adults don't change - apparently even if your kid's been missing 5 years
[2:09:05] <Parapattern> Wow, taking it like a trooper
[2:09:09] <Warbot40> @penitentpendant yes.
[2:09:09] <shieldecho> ...Yeah good luck with that
[2:09:10] <%The_Gaming_Karp> You need to stop bringing people bad news.
[2:09:16] <Nupinoop296> poor guy
[2:09:17] <+kimo313> Sadge
[2:09:17] <Devbob98> She’s fine thesph1JillSad
[2:09:20] <zenith0111> Papa Nier doesnt feel like he needs to "grow"
[2:09:21] <lemon_lover28> oh no. Hope he doesn't run off and get killed only for Juliet to still be alive
[2:09:27] <ihavesillyknees> @vidulasaix I think the reason is that you had a role of big brother pre TS wheras you dont post TS
[2:09:27] <%Monkeyweed21> f o r e s h a d o w i n g
[2:09:31] <InugamiTheHound> @zenith0111 yeah that is true but i guess Papa Nier became even stronger and wore a dumb eye patch.
[2:09:31] <%Axellogic> Your soul
[2:09:31] <+BIumen> consumables
[2:09:33] <%AzureGale> Weapons
[2:09:34] <Mr_JustinJones> thats true
[2:09:35] <VidulaSaix> Honestly been wondering that myself
[2:09:35] <penitentpendant> Consumables
[2:09:36] <pixelkenj> Books
[2:09:38] <%linSP> books
[2:09:39] <%maskofmichael> Weapons
[2:09:39] <zenith0111> Food
[2:09:40] <+JustToWatch> crops
[2:09:40] <%SunnyVarietyPack> I sell pelts and stuff
[2:09:40] <%kujofire990> cocaine
[2:09:42] <%rottingpastry> @olaksi he can develop, but the whole, "I can't use big sword, now I CAN use big sword" transition is weird for papa nier
[2:09:43] <amritadyne> lunar tears lmao
[2:09:44] <zenith0111> Fish
[2:09:44] <pixelkenj> Spider Silk
[2:09:44] <%AzureGale> The blood of your fallen enemies
[2:09:45] <lemon_lover28> I ehar drugs have  agood margin
[2:09:45] <Parapattern> "Hey your girlfriend is dead." "No she isn't."
[2:09:48] <twohitgood> mutton
[2:09:49] <%linSP> anything machine or metal keep for upgrades
[2:09:50] <%Jaxnos> mainly the books and crops, yeah
[2:09:51] <ItsPastas> shade drops mostly
[2:09:51] <twohitgood> fish
[2:09:53] <%Axellogic> grow trees
[2:09:54] <%SunnyVarietyPack> flowers
[2:09:54] <Mr_JustinJones> junkyard stuff
[2:09:55] <penitentpendant> Basically, if you go over 7 of a health item sell till you hit 7
[2:09:55] <%Monkeyweed21> Food and flowers @PatStaresAt
[2:09:56] <m_ccloud> lunar tears, scrap items, crops, meat
[2:09:57] <%bevyrage> medicinal herbs are good to sell because you can pick up so many of them
[2:09:58] <%AzureGale> Pokemon cards
[2:10:01] <mai_cu> Weapons
[2:10:02] <%Jaxnos> oh and FISH
[2:10:05] <shieldecho> If you keep slaughtering sheep you can bring it to that one woman for 1500 every time, fairly tedious but easy money
[2:10:07] <pixelkenj> maybe like half of your dented metal boardsd
[2:10:07] <%AzureGale> Amiibo
[2:10:08] <$Futurecity10> @PatStaresAt If you're grinding quests off stream, you'll get an abundance of bent shit
[2:10:08] <Devbob98> That’s why you farm to sell
[2:10:14] <zenith0111> Fish is big money later
[2:10:25] <%bevyrage> you need some of those scrap items for upgrades
[2:10:26] <m_ccloud> like books i and stuff that dont matter i meant
[2:10:33] <shieldecho> Ten mutton = 1500 gold
[2:10:36] <%linSP> even broken stuff is used for upgrades
[2:10:41] <StarMechV> Is the music worbly or is that just how it is in this town?
[2:10:42] <VidulaSaix> Fishing still sucks dick early on but once you get more ranks it gets significantly easier
[2:10:48] <penitentpendant> @Warbot40 A new big sidequest, post DLC content that, if i remember right, wasn't in the english release. And more story stuff.
[2:10:48] <zenith0111> Side Quests also dumo huge wads of cash at you
[2:10:49] <%Monkeyweed21> scrap is stuff like books and wooden masks @PatStaresAt
[2:10:52] <%Chester_goes_Berserk> keep any factory items especially
[2:10:53] <shieldecho> Oh yeah fish really good money
[2:10:55] <Devbob98> Give melon
[2:10:57] <twohitgood> ten mutton is easy to get on a sunny day.
[2:11:01] <olaksi> @rottingpastry he's been single mindedly focused on fighting to bring his kid back? Of course he changes to more aggressive
[2:11:04] <%linSP> silly fast pig
[2:11:12] <iosephe> ride the fatty pig pig
[2:11:14] <%bevyrage> SICK BOAR SKILLS
[2:11:15] <ihavesillyknees> Honestly I feel like Brother Nier change with the timeskip was higher than Papa Nier.
[2:11:15] <Parapattern> The boar should have even less frames

[2:12:28] <%rottingpastry> @olaksi I mean, yeah, but why wasn't he using spears and big swords the whole time? it's weird. baby nier has the excuse of noodle arms at least
[2:12:29] <%BoxNavy> no
[2:12:30] <+BigCoffee> Fine
[2:12:31] <%RetroCop87> beastbain + dark lance = OHK

[2:13:03] <%RetroCop87> you can check if you can upgrade from the weapon detail screen
[2:13:04] <%SunnyVarietyPack> for each?
[2:13:05] <tattleworm> you'll need some iron ore but you can buy it at the junk heap @PatStaresAt
[2:13:06] <+BigCoffee> phoenix spear
[2:13:06] <Djinnazz> Phoenmix
[2:13:10] <InugamiTheHound> Phoenix spear!
[2:13:14] <VidulaSaix> Spear until DLC and post game, then two hand and sword get ridiculous
[2:13:14] <zenith0111> Papa Niersc child like naivety also comes off as more troubled and deranged than endearing
[2:13:18] <%RetroCop87> you can buy iron ore
[2:13:18] <AoiRob> check in the weapon details for upgrade materials
[2:13:20] <+oktavia_von> everytime someone points it out my eyes go from normal pants to fishnets
[2:13:20] <%BoxNavy> phoenix is what ive been using
[2:13:22] <+BIumen> you can buy iron ores at 1k each
[2:13:22] <%Chester_goes_Berserk> beast Bain is best before time skip
[2:13:23] <+ABigPinkLion> you can buy iron ore from the brothers
[2:13:24] <%holydeviant1> welp
[2:13:24] <%Axellogic> I like the stabby
[2:13:25] <%cvp5127> buy some from smith
[2:13:26] <The_Legendairy> phoenix spear
[2:13:28] <%linSP> you could buy iron ore but its kinda expensive
[2:13:33] <$Futurecity10> @PatStaresAt Pheonix Spear, Pheonix Spear, and Pheonix Spear
[2:13:34] <penitentpendant> Oof that's some money
[2:13:38] <pixelkenj> check the yorha materials
[2:13:39] <%RetroCop87> TIME TO FARM MUTTON
[2:13:40] <tattleworm> oh shoot, didn't realise it was that expensive, my b
[2:13:42] <%arcielardor> The Good Are you can upgrade to full earliest and it do biggest number.
[2:13:43] <%linSP> a ore
[2:13:43] <Laecerelius> That's almost as much as he spent on the weapon!
[2:13:44] <penitentpendant> Grinding offscreen it is!
[2:13:54] <%ElkRiverDog> Phoenix
[2:13:55] <johnchikr> Thicc sword do big number
[2:13:57] <%arcielardor> Vile Axe
[2:13:58] <%Lion_kun> I'VE BEEN FARMING FOR AN EAGLE EGG FOR AN HOUR I  CANNOT GET ONE.
[2:13:58] <xeros720> time to grow some veg
[2:13:59] <%Jaxnos> it's easier to just walk to where iron ore spawns. which is on the way to your facade happy times
[2:14:01] <%BoxNavy> are the fool weapons not as good as phoenix?
[2:14:03] <AoiRob> welp! time to KILL
[2:14:06] <VidulaSaix> Phoenix Spear until Route B, then the DLC 2 hander becomes the best weapon because it gets a max attack stat
[2:14:10] <ihavesillyknees> People have so many interpretations as to why Papa Nier act as a kid. and I can only think is that "they couldn't change that bit of dialogue."
[2:14:14] <%Chester_goes_Berserk> upgrading doesn't really matter before the time skip
[2:14:20] <%linSP> i grinded an hour for some alloys to get the final faith upgrade before the skip
[2:14:24] <%RetroCop87> YOU FISH FOR THE RUSTED CLUMP USING A LURE IN FRESH WATER
[2:14:25] <pixelkenj> Rusted Clump is from fishing, Crystals are from Facade's store
[2:14:28] <%Dakuu75> Man, I fucking WISH more games were like that. Just fucking PRINT the shopping list ONTO the weapon
[2:14:29] <%RetroCop87> whoops, caps lock

[2:14:42] <%BoxNavy> 🦎
[2:14:43] <zenith0111> If you have been deligent in your grind and side quests phoenix spear wont be the best when you get it

[2:14:48] <korlege> @ihavesillyknees thats because you're correct
[2:14:53] <%linSP> this place has so many lizards

[2:15:27] <%Dakuu75> starring att his white desert \
[2:15:29] <%BoxNavy> chats saying phoenix but i unno. ive just been using the phoenix spear
[2:15:32] <johnchikr> Phoenix dagger is the best but you can't get it yet
[2:15:32] <%Monkeyweed21> @PatStaresAt dont forget about the super ugly DLC weapons
[2:15:34] <tattleworm> best sword and heavy come from 15 nightmares, but you gotta get ending A to unlock that @PatStaresAt
[2:15:34] <ihavesillyknees> Oh this is the rule place!
[2:15:35] <%linSP> what you dont like bloom?
[2:15:37] <zenith0111> Any Weapon max is good. The differences are not that big really
[2:15:38] <%Chester_goes_Berserk> it's the dlc sword if that's still in this game
[2:15:39] <%SunnyVarietyPack> nah 2 handed weapons are important
[2:15:41] <InugamiTheHound> best one handed is beastbain, Phoenix spear, vile axe
[2:15:44] <ihavesillyknees> Weiss you pride!
[2:15:49] <%Dakuu75> HE TWIRLED ON THAT ONE
[2:15:53] <%AzureGale> lol Weiss finally calls out
[2:15:54] <ihavesillyknees> Weiss the prude strikes again
[2:15:55] <LordOfThePoultry> SourPls
[2:15:55] <maskedmook> the Recycled Vessel weapons are the best except for spear
[2:15:56] <johnchikr> Except ugly DLC weapons, those are super strong but ugly as hell
[2:15:57] <cardamomo88> yesss LEST GOOOO
[2:15:59] <%Dakuu75> did you guys see Weiss spin, after he sdaid that?!
[2:16:02] <The_Legendairy> i played on normal in the original and the un-upgraded phoenix spear trivialized combat
[2:16:03] <pixelkenj> Is Facade just a Big Majora's Mask reference
[2:16:09] <OswaldTheDog> les GOOOOOO
[2:16:11] <%linSP> dlc is always best, but two of the base game best ones are phoenix ones
[2:16:12] <zenith0111> @johnchikr No magic power
[2:16:18] <JetpackMcQuack> Neat
[2:16:22] <+valiard> You cant say an upgrade is wasted if it improves a weapon
[2:16:25] <%AzureGale> GROUND WAVE
[2:16:25] <AoiRob> the whole game's a zelda reference
[2:16:27] <+D00msDayDan> those wells are fast travel, you unlock them by talking to the advisor after saving the king and then reloading the city
[2:16:28] <%rumtumtugnutz> Weigg came for Quarry Whore, dang
[2:16:30] <pixelkenj> Max noooooooo
[2:16:30] <%Jaxnos> you should use the one-handed claw thingy you can grab in Facade for the funsies
[2:16:33] <InugamiTheHound> this is area for the best fish in the game in weird sand lake LOL
[2:16:34] <Djinnazz> @P for most of the game i used Virtuous Dignity Treaty
[2:16:35] <cardamomo88> oh the woofies BibleThump BibleThump
[2:16:36] <Laecerelius> They hunt in packs, Arisen!
[2:16:36] <%linSP> awoooo

[2:16:54] <StarMechV> oh no wooolves
[2:16:54] <%rottingpastry> bork busters
[2:16:56] <%Jeshk0> how dare you kill puppy D: D:
[2:16:56] <%RetroCop87> Once you get access to the dust cloud zone, you can farm wolves non-stop
[2:17:02] <StarMechV> we should kill the wolves
[2:17:05] <%the38bandit> why would wolves be in the desert tho?
[2:17:12] <OswaldTheDog> someone still needs to explain to me how WOLVES with thick ass coats live in this desert
[2:17:21] <zenith0111> But it has 0 Magic Power
[2:17:28] <+fetrigon> SNUFF THOSE PUPPERS YE woolieYE
[2:17:30] <%SunnyVarietyPack> honestly the one handed yorha weapons are good but there are much better two handed and spears
[2:17:30] <cardamomo88> they are magic wolfies
[2:17:32] <pixelkenj> ominous
[2:17:33] <ihavesillyknees> @the38bandit Because they don't know how to swim, so the ocean is off the table
[2:17:47] <Devbob98> Maybe some keeps them clean
[2:17:49] <%Dakuu75> "fresh" graves I guess
[2:17:57] <pixelkenj> can they not see the shade coloring on the Pack Leader or what
[2:17:59] <+valiard> @AzureGale you still learn something from the exchange
[2:18:02] <soflicar> at max upgrade phoenix dagger is best 1-hand 346 80%, but that is only untainable at the end, virtus contract is best otherwise (570 0%)
[2:18:13] <Laecerelius> 9 more iron ore!

[2:18:48] <%BoxNavy> :)
[2:18:49] <%Jaxnos> "Hey guys, Kaine with the fatty is back!"
[2:18:51] <+CursedNobleman> speaking broken japanese? LUL

[2:18:58] <%RetroCop87> all of Facade is amazing
[2:19:03] <%cvp5127> this socciety doesnt make sense
[2:19:11] <InugamiTheHound> THICC ass is spilling out of that underwear
[2:19:12] <olaksi> I forget if they ever explain why they love Kaine so much
[2:19:12] <+davidwave4_> Of course NieR is a Gemini
[2:19:21] <%rottingpastry> Rule 124,328: no memes allowed
[2:19:21] <zenith0111> @cvp5127 Reminds me of somewhere Kappa
[2:19:23] <ihavesillyknees> They explain it
[2:19:26] <SunnySideX> Facade is such a cool town
[2:19:28] <AoiRob> @olaksi she saved some kids
[2:19:33] <OldManDeckardCain> a society of Pats
[2:19:35] <%Dakuu75> -because they can't understand her
[2:19:39] <Devbob98> Because she’s kaine
[2:19:42] <ihavesillyknees> So yeah she rules
[2:19:44] <OswaldTheDog> kaine must get sand *everywhere* when she comes here
[2:19:49] <Parapattern> Only good things can come from a town named Facade
[2:19:50] <%linSP> they also let her in because theyre horny mask men
[2:19:52] <%Axellogic> this music sounds different
[2:19:54] <cardamomo88> this place rulez fuck the other places
[2:19:57] <peyodogo> i read somewhere that you "need to have subtitles enabled" to get the facade people's conlang, not sure what that means in this game tho
[2:20:01] <%BoxNavy> this games audio mixing is really bad sometimes
[2:20:09] <%RetroCop87> I love how absolutely done with this place Weiss gets
[2:20:10] <peyodogo> oh nevermind
[2:20:11] <%Maids4lyfe> oh yes this place "rules" alright
[2:20:12] <peyodogo> lmao
[2:20:13] <ihavesillyknees> Kaine doesn't like sand, it's coarse rough and gets everywhere.
[2:20:21] <+davidwave4_> The developers realized that the game's OST is WAY better than the dialogue
[2:20:25] <AzureGale> I gotta get the sand out of my negligee
[2:20:25] <%linSP> this place rules Kappa
[2:20:28] <+LionKagura> @peyodogo watch the subs
[2:20:32] <+Birdigalore> Almost japanese
[2:20:32] <Mattais88> Just Japanese

[2:20:43] <%The_Gaming_Karp> she distinctly said keisatsu
[2:20:47] <pixelkenj> ish
[2:20:50] <+CursedNobleman> aye, very similar
[2:20:51] <%shurtal> like garbled japanese
[2:20:52] <+BigDumBeak> is it the same language as the songs are sung in?
[2:20:52] <%RetroCop87> those are still Japanese VA's
[2:20:53] <ihavesillyknees> Simlish
[2:20:55] <iosephe> Definitely sounds like it
[2:20:56] <johnchikr> It's Japanese but with few syllables switched out
[2:20:56] <cardamomo88> okrismas desu
[2:20:56] <%BoxNavy> japanese'nt
[2:20:57] <Daniel_Is_I> It's the same kind of fake Japanese they use for MH language
[2:20:59] <%The_Gaming_Karp> it's like 70% Japanese and 30% jibberish
[2:20:59] <xbb1024> It's a Japanese person inventing a fake language
[2:21:01] <ihavesillyknees> Its simlish
[2:21:04] <%Monkeyweed21> its Pig Japanese
[2:21:08] <pixelkenj> evolved japanese over 1400 years
[2:21:09] <+D00msDayDan> japan't
[2:21:09] <%Maids4lyfe> Japanish
[2:21:11] <+Punchasaur> This music is fucking loud yo
[2:21:15] <m_ccloud> from what i heard the devs created the language using ai might be wrong about that tho
[2:21:16] <peyodogo> @LionKagura yeah i saw, just derped for a sec

[2:21:21] <%linSP> japain't
[2:21:25] <%neroforte177> so she willingly goes back to a village that hates her guts instead of going to one that despite not speaking a single word she does welcomes her with open arms

[2:26:23] <ihavesillyknees> It's against the rules to not see.
[2:26:23] <%RetroCop87> Fyra needs her inhaler

[2:32:50] <zenith0111> Magic bullshit tho
[2:32:50] <olaksi> Theoretically the equator is livable
[2:32:53] <mimi777> Weiss: WE LIVE IN A SOCIETY
[2:32:54] <+Dumb_Parrot> Not all over the planet. There'd be a ribbon of survivable land, pretty much
[2:32:54] <Sain_127> what a nerd
[2:32:55] <mighty_fine_trousers> I thought they were thrown out of orbit?
[2:32:57] <%Arweynn> there's a tiny band of habitability, this desert is on the edge of it
[2:32:57] <%JoshManVGH> There may be a goldilocks zone of habitable area along like a longitude or something.
[2:32:58] <+D00msDayDan> Yeah don’t worry about it
[2:33:01] <IamGrapes> is that right?

[2:33:03] <+livi242> why is it always black man cmonBruh
[2:33:06] <vampirate1> @za7az I do too. I'd probably be a boring book though
[2:33:08] <%Arweynn> we never see the ice- side of the band
[2:33:10] <+Punchasaur> Weiss wears a mask that covers everything BUT his mouth
[2:33:13] <ihavesillyknees> I want to visit the reddit of this city.
[2:33:13] <aPictureInMotion> kermit pat
[2:33:21] <+Birdigalore> These people walking barefoot on stone in the sunlight is hurting my feet
[2:33:22] <muddiestpath> weiss probably enjoyed all the whiteness
[2:33:23] <pixelkenj> book magic
[2:33:24] <%bassoontyphoon> "How can you tell that Fyra doesn't have duct tape over her mouth and isn't being trafficked? You can't if she's wearing that mask" -Weiss
[2:33:29] <%maskofmichael> Don't think about it
[2:33:29] <%Valdorick> The poles get sun for 6 months and are..... ostensibly livable.
[2:33:32] <%JoshManVGH> But also, something something Demonic Element
[2:33:33] <+LionKagura> hes a magic book
[2:33:33] <%BoxNavy> hes a magic book :)
[2:33:40] <%rumtumtugnutz> If I could be a magic book, I'd prtobably be a phone book
[2:33:40] <%za7az> @vampirate1 A dictionary perhaps?
[2:33:50] <xbb1024> he used his learning algorithm
[2:33:54] <%solracc25> He's plot convenience magic
[2:34:00] <%RigmaroleHM> Need kermit emote for Pat yawns
[2:34:02] <Ethel9727> "Hey Weiss, this is just to protect people."  "Preposterous, I will not wear a mask for THEIR sake!"
[2:34:04] <%rumtumtugnutz> I'd always have a number ready for pizza
[2:34:05] <ihavesillyknees> How far are we in the tour?
[2:34:07] <%The_Gaming_Karp> if Earth ceased to spin, each "day and night would last six months.  . . .   This could result in extreme temperatures of 135 and -67 degrees Fahrenheit during the day and night respectively."
[2:34:14] <%rottingpastry> It's a Yoko Taro game. Everything is to troll you
[2:34:14] <Sain_127> if nothing else works just flip them off
[2:34:21] <%rottingpastry> Even when you're having fun, you're being trolled
[2:34:25] <%RetroCop87> Weiss doesn't even have lungs
[2:34:30] <Sain_127> i bet they can understand that
[2:34:32] <%RigmaroleHM> "Sounds like a conspiracy"
[2:34:36] <+BIumen> weiss is a zoomer technically
[2:34:40] <Khester824> ARE CEREAL SOUPS!?
[2:34:42] <ihavesillyknees> Weiss is te biggest boomer
[2:34:43] <%Axellogic> "I cant catch covid why would I wear a mask!"
[2:34:47] <+LittleBigQuebec> can books even get sick?
[2:34:53] <%RetroCop87> hah hah hah hah hah hah hah
[2:34:54] <Ethel9727> Oh god, Weiss even has memory loss so he'd think White Chlorination syndrome is made up
[2:34:55] <Sain_127> cereals are soups
[2:34:57] <yourwebgod> based
[2:35:02] <+LittleBigQuebec> I mean it's a funny joke
[2:35:07] <Sain_127> OH NO
[2:35:09] <IamGrapes> books get sick with bookworms
[2:35:14] <Sain_127> WHAT HAVE I DONE
[2:35:16] <ihavesillyknees> What?
[2:35:20] <%RigmaroleHM> Man I've enraged a couple people with that comment
[2:35:20] <%rottingpastry> they are cold soups, yes
[2:35:20] <+skyheys> IT IS SOUP
[2:35:21] <%Jaxnos> hold Sain down
[2:35:21] <+LittleBigQuebec> LAUGH AT THEM
[2:35:22] <olaksi> he's not wrong
[2:35:22] <Daniel_Is_I> They're not soups
[2:35:23] <ihavesillyknees> How could you?
[2:35:25] <penitentpendant> But are they quickbreads?
[2:35:29] <Ethel9727> No, the true violence is to ask if a pot pie is BOTH a soup and a sandwich
[2:35:29] <HeroToxiko> filler arc villain of the week LUL
[2:35:31] <yourwebgod> wait cereal isn't hot tho
[2:35:32] <rekinom> pop tars are ravioli
[2:35:34] <Grennold> Books get sick with mould FeelsBadMan
[2:35:34] <%AyotoCorp> Cereals are chowders
[2:35:34] <Zebroneath> One has chosen death, it seems
[2:35:36] <%Maids4lyfe> it's a chowder
[2:35:36] <%BoxNavy> cereal can be whatever you want it to be :)
[2:35:37] <Sol_Install> I can't believe were doing this
[2:35:38] <%RetroCop87> Is clam chowda cereal?
[2:35:39] <$Futurecity10> I will kill any motherfucker who says cereal aint a soup
[2:35:39] <ihavesillyknees> It's the muffin are cakes argument again!
[2:35:40] <majindusto> Cereal  Isn't  a Soup?
[2:35:41] <%solracc25> the ocean is soup
[2:35:42] <+Kyma1020> I mean yeah and rat can't swim
[2:35:42] <%neroforte177> boo this man
[2:35:43] <%hoodedlefty> What did I miss
[2:35:43] <%Valdorick> @yourwebgod Oatmeal is.
[2:35:44] <zenith0111> Hussy DansGame
[2:35:44] <%rottingpastry> pot pie is a soup sandwich
[2:35:46] <spuginky> HUSSY
[2:35:48] <%coward_man> cereal is a stew
[2:35:49] <%The_Gaming_Karp> A hot dog is a sandwich.
[2:35:50] <OswaldTheDog> they are tho?
[2:35:51] <ammobasket> Anti-scub arise
[2:35:53] <Glacierstorm> hot dogs are not sandwiches, hot dogs are tacos
[2:35:54] <+eanscrale> Isn't it a porridge?
[2:35:56] <%bassoontyphoon> Soup is "a liquid food made by boiling or simmering meat, fish, or vegetables with various added ingredients." So, to answer this burning question, based on ***, cereal does not count as a soup
[2:35:58] <%solracc25> lol
[2:35:59] <+Birdigalore> SPEAK THE TRUTH, HUSSY
[2:36:02] <%Monkeyweed21> IS GASPATCHO JUST TOMATO CEREAL
[2:36:03] <Oxybe> Ketchup is a smoothie
[2:36:03] <Ethel9727> Kaine's greatest disappointment in life is that there isn't a slur word for books
[2:36:04] <rekinom> There are cold soups chat
[2:36:04] <vampirate1> book ain't racist, but kaine sure as hell makes it sound like it is
[2:36:04] <AoiRob> @PatStaresAt centarus have 6 limbs. they're bugs
[2:36:05] <%rottingpastry> tacos are sandwiches
[2:36:07] <ihavesillyknees> THIS IS SO JAPANESE
[2:36:08] <+Ropcord> DansGame BOOK
[2:36:09] <%General_Terro> stew is just liquid casserole
[2:36:11] <Devbob98> He got lost on the tour
[2:36:14] <%BoxNavy> NotLikeThis
[2:36:14] <%Jaxnos> hold everyone calling cereal a soup for questioning
[2:36:15] <TioXyco> considering that Weiss hates being called book, it surely IS swear for him
[2:36:16] <Sain_127> LUL
[2:36:16] <cardamomo88> dejavu¡
[2:36:16] <zenith0111> Rule 2: Cereal is Soul
[2:36:16] <olaksi> Actually that's wrong, I looked up the definition, you need to boil the cereal to make it a soup
[2:36:17] <nevan_44> cereal is bath salts
[2:36:18] <ihavesillyknees> They're totally speaking japanese
[2:36:18] <muddiestpath> soup is a derwal
[2:36:18] <%linSP> guess hes fucked
[2:36:22] <%Maids4lyfe> pizza is a sandwich
[2:36:25] <%RetroCop87> *cough Japan cough*
[2:36:35] <%The_Gaming_Karp> It's a messed up civil code system.
[2:36:36] <Glacierstorm> sandwiches are open in the middle not closed on a side, a sub is technically not a sandwich unless the bread rips
[2:36:37] <majindusto> THIS IS THE WAY
[2:36:41] <Ethel9727> But milk is pasteurized so wouldn't that make cereal a soup?
[2:36:42] <%rottingpastry> calzone is a sandwich, pizza is an open faced sandwich if you eat it right
[2:36:42] <ihavesillyknees> "Why did they make a bunch of rules that contradict each other" - NIER found religion.
[2:36:43] <%rumtumtugnutz> ANYWAY HERE'S WONDERWALL
[2:36:43] <%barrakuta371> "Oh no, we're in violation of some bullshit!" - Pat, OG Nier playthrough 2016
[2:36:45] <Glacierstorm> therefore a hotdog is a taco
[2:36:45] <+CursedNobleman> screw the rules I have WEISS
[2:36:47] <%Axellogic> Hotdogs are tiny sub sandwhiches
[2:36:53] <%AzureGale> SCREW THE RULES I HAVE MONEY
[2:36:54] <IamGrapes> @Maids4lyfe no, pizza is a pie
[2:36:56] <%solracc25> Break all the rules!!!
[2:36:58] <Oxybe> KETCHUP IS A SMOOTHIE. CHANGE MY MIND.
[2:37:12] <%The_Gaming_Karp> A pizza is a giant open sandwich.
[2:37:13] <%solracc25> Not me, I'm a maverick
[2:37:15] <%emperordread> I unironically think it's cool to follow the rules (rather than going "I know better than EVERYONE")
[2:37:18] <ihavesillyknees> THATS CONVENIENT!!!!
[2:37:26] <%za7az> @The_Gaming_Karp Leave...
[2:37:26] <%bevyrage> weiss you're suppose to be the book that saves the world
[2:37:28] <%RetroCop87> Weiss is lonely
[2:37:29] <Sain_127> he's got no friends lol
[2:37:31] <Daniel_Is_I> Because he's tsun tsun
[2:37:32] <%LaughingCatt> because he isnt as much of a jackass as he puts on
[2:37:32] <%shootbang_exe> because he's a tsundere book
[2:37:32] <cardamomo88> HE HAS NOT FRIENDS
[2:37:32] <Visorak6> Because you freed him I guess
[2:37:33] <ihavesillyknees> That's the biggest convenient rule ecer
[2:37:33] <+BigDumBeak> I thought Weiss was bound to the kid or something
[2:37:34] <+davidwave4_> Weiss is a tsundere
[2:37:35] <pixelkenj> His ego, he wants to be the legendary book that saves the day
[2:37:38] <LordOfThePoultry> he lost his memories and heas no where else to go
[2:37:38] <Sain_127> ohh thats right
[2:37:38] <%JoshManVGH> Contractual obligations.
[2:37:39] <%hoodedlefty> I love and hate the Baran Temple
[2:37:40] <Ethel9727> Legit I think the reason Weiss went along with them initially was for the ego trip of saving the world
[2:37:40] <Devbob98> He bored
[2:37:43] <zenith0111> Ye dumb dumb
[2:37:43] <xbb1024> Weiss is bored
[2:37:45] <+Punchasaur> Whens weiss vs dr. Hakim
[2:37:47] <%rottingpastry> it's not like he likes you or anything, baka
[2:37:47] <vampirate1> He's got nothing better to do
[2:37:47] <Explodincatz> because Im a Baka
[2:37:48] <mrvamp77> is the music the same or is it different than the original?
[2:37:50] <%solracc25> Float away you book
[2:37:54] <softbirby> Weiss secretly good boy
[2:37:55] <%Axellogic> Weiss wants to watch your little boy live his tiny life
[2:37:57] <$Futurecity10> He's a Tsun
[2:38:01] <%The_Gaming_Karp> @The_Gaming_Karp You cannot fight the truth.
[2:38:01] <muddiestpath> weiss isn't peer reviewed bc that would require him to have friends
[2:38:02] <HollowMan190> who he really wants Kanie
[2:38:03] <%rumtumtugnutz> Is this the fire temple?
[2:38:03] <ihavesillyknees> Weiss is that guy who talks shit but has no other friends
[2:38:04] <%RetroCop87> "it's not like I want to unlock the sealed verses with your or anything, b-baka"
[2:38:08] <%JoshManVGH> It's not he likes them or anything!
[2:38:08] <Ethel9727> @mrvamp77 It's re-recorded and remastered

[2:38:24] <%BoxNavy> moon2W
[2:38:25] <penitentpendant> Ah yes, escort missiosn
[2:38:28] <%Axellogic> Does she need a respirator or something
[2:38:28] <%za7az> @The_Gaming_Karp HyperTiger
[2:38:31] <Devbob98> You could carry her faster tbh
[2:38:33] <pixelkenj> it get sstronk
[2:38:33] <%solracc25> reverse escort?
[2:38:33] <%RetroCop87> at least it is early game
[2:38:35] <ihavesillyknees> Escorting mission yay...
[2:38:38] <Daniel_Is_I> Faster than you walk, slower than you run. IT'S HELL.
[2:38:39] <%coward_man> a hotdog is a bread based taco
[2:38:42] <Glacierstorm> i like beastbain until you can upgrade virtuous
[2:38:43] <%Valdorick> Buy that power.
[2:38:43] <soflicar> at max not right now
[2:38:44] <DigitalMystik> it took me too long to realize that most weapons have a charge strong attack
[2:38:44] <%Monkeyweed21> need to upgrade it
[2:38:44] <%rumtumtugnutz> Watch out for tusken raiders
[2:38:49] <%rottingpastry> the only right way to do this part is to run in a circle around her
[2:38:51] <Ethel9727> @Axellogic Maybe covid really did hit facade
[2:38:51] <%RetroCop87> HERE WE GO
[2:38:51] <Blank9> Faith is one of the best 1handed swords in the game, but you get that from the forest.
[2:38:52] <+Punchasaur> Riveting
[2:38:54] <%Jaxnos> this is the best part of the game
[2:38:54] <majindusto> TIME PARADOX WEAPON
[2:38:57] <penitentpendant> Can we strap her to the Boar?
[2:38:58] <%AzureGale> Is a pizza an open-faced sandwich
[2:38:59] <%JoshManVGH> Not until upgrade now, that beast sword is great
[2:38:59] <HollowMan190> look at her go

[2:39:14] <LordOfThePoultry> PAT NO
[2:39:15] <+Birdigalore> TIME PARADOX
[2:39:15] <ihavesillyknees> Classic Early 2000s game design
[2:39:16] <+BigDumBeak> pat she's DOING her BEST
[2:39:17] <majindusto> SHUSH PAT
[2:39:18] <%Dakuu75> @PatStaresAt was gonna try out Automata for the first time. Any advice?
[2:39:21] <Laioken13> and you don't have a walk that keeps up
[2:39:22] <+ALazo> her legs are too short :(
[2:39:24] <AoiRob> YEET
[2:39:30] <Ethel9727> Are y'all forgetting that Phoenix Spear is still as broken as ever?
[2:39:31] <muddiestpath> you try running with a cone on your head
[2:39:34] <cardamomo88> SHE HAS BABY LEGS
[2:39:37] <xinexes> PAT killer of CHILDREN
[2:39:39] <OswaldTheDog> why did they design it like this???????
[2:39:44] <Glacierstorm> in the blazing heat no less
[2:39:47] <%RetroCop87> aim for 10 wolf hides for the divorce sidequest
[2:39:48] <majindusto> SHE'S  DOING  THE BEST SHE CAN BibleThump
[2:39:48] <%solracc25> child is immune to magic
[2:39:50] <%rumtumtugnutz> Quarry whore! Piggyback Pointy Girl!
[2:39:51] <ihavesillyknees> It's an old game
[2:39:51] <Visorak6> Man this really IS the same desert from automata huh
[2:39:53] <penitentpendant> But you played Pyramid Head in DBD?
[2:39:54] <+Birdigalore> She's just pacing hersel;f
[2:39:54] <+livi242> the Nier greatsword does 999 damage fully upgraded
[2:39:55] <%rottingpastry> @OswaldTheDog fuck you, that's why!
[2:39:55] <IamGrapes> he cant buy maps becuase of rule 6969
[2:39:55] <+emVulpine> Pyramid Head can do it, Fyra has no excuse.
[2:39:56] <%Monkeyweed21> She is BAREFOOT
[2:39:57] <%AzureGale> Is that a Helghast mask
[2:39:57] <%VoidBaronJules> gief will soon tho
[2:40:01] <Devbob98> Gief’s future
[2:40:04] <ihavesillyknees> 2000s game design bruh

[2:40:09] <%RetroCop87> 40% there
[2:40:14] <Blank9> this entire dungeon coming up is weird as hell
[2:40:16] <Glacierstorm> dont worry, now theres gonna be wolves
[2:40:17] <Sain_127> bruh she is going to die midway with all that huffing
[2:40:18] <Blank9> and cool
[2:40:20] <AoiRob> @OswaldTheDog it's Yoko Taro he 100% did it to fuck with everyone
[2:40:28] <LordOfThePoultry> gonna have to do this again eventually LUL
[2:40:32] <ihavesillyknees> Someone give her some water!!!
[2:40:35] <Laecerelius> I will move faster than your walk speed but slower than your run speed to make this as fucking awkward as possible
[2:40:36] <%BoxNavy> moon2W
[2:40:36] <Warbot40> did they age her up? She looks bigger.
[2:40:42] <%hoodedlefty> I wish they added a Fassad costume for NieR
[2:40:43] <%rottingpastry> "beware the wolves" always good advice
[2:40:45] <majindusto> Don't  be rude to the Pyramid  Head daughter
[2:40:46] <+eanscrale> As expected from the master Mr. Yoko.
[2:40:48] <%bevyrage> didn't loot the wolf
[2:40:52] <Ethel9727> @OswaldTheDog Didn't he say that he heard people complaining about the text adventure in NieR which convinced him to add one in Automata?
[2:40:54] <%rottingpastry> don't walk away if you don't want to be sad
[2:40:56] <ihavesillyknees> Jesus Christ shes going to die of dehydration
[2:40:58] <Parapattern> Would be nice to have a mask
[2:41:03] <pixelkenj> but imagine being Kaine right now
[2:41:04] <%AzureGale> This is why you don't WEAR SHORTS IN A DESERT
[2:41:06] <%BoxNavy> weiss... doesnt even open his mouth to talk...
[2:41:06] <+D00msDayDan> Look out they hunt in packs
[2:41:25] <Blank9> but how can you breathe with a mask on, that's impossible
[2:41:25] <ihavesillyknees> @pixelkenj Kaine must be in hell right now!
[2:41:25] <%RetroCop87> dark blast AOE charge is great for this
[2:41:34] <Devbob98> Sand wolves are the worst
[2:41:35] <%Dakuu75> is there a Lock-On for the magics?
[2:41:36] <+CursedNobleman> is the gameplay fun? or is it blahblah filler between story beats
[2:41:37] <+tetraes> why is kaine's magic blue when everyone else is red?
[2:41:40] <Laecerelius> Kaine snuffin those puppers with style
[2:41:41] <%rottingpastry> Kaine is always in hell
[2:41:48] <ihavesillyknees> Kaine ve like "SAND IS EVERYWHERE!!!"
[2:41:51] <%AzureGale> Just like my nephew
[2:41:51] <%JoshManVGH> Unlocking tutorials is the fucking strangest part of this game.
[2:41:53] <Sain_127> which she conserves in her short little legs
[2:41:53] <%Alazull> Black Dragon?
[2:41:58] <%bevyrage> emil's magic is purple isn't it?
[2:42:01] <%RetroCop87> @Dakuu75 dark blast charge attack has AOE lock on
[2:42:03] <zenith0111> Why is Emils purple?
[2:42:05] <%Maids4lyfe> yes
[2:42:06] <TioXyco> her magic si blue, emil's is purple
[2:42:08] <%bassoontyphoon> you need to watch the nier stageplay to find out
[2:42:08] <cardamomo88> is she??
[2:42:14] <ihavesillyknees> It's probably explained in the live stage show
[2:42:20] <+Kyma1020> Tyrran maybe?
[2:42:20] <%JoshManVGH> Cause science weapon.
[2:42:20] <+D00msDayDan> So you don’t mistake it for an enemy’s
[2:42:24] <%Maids4lyfe> because it was artificially made
[2:42:24] <%BoxNavy> monkaS
[2:42:25] <Devbob98> Because she’s the cool protagonist
[2:42:25] <+ABigPinkLion> Because he's a super weapon or some shit
[2:42:25] <%Axellogic> why is color
[2:42:25] <%SunnyVarietyPack> Why does emile got a long bone dick
[2:42:29] <Tracazoid> I assume Emil's is because of what was done to him
[2:42:31] <johnchikr> This is like a reverse escort mission
[2:42:36] <+Kindan55> Aether magic in XIV is blue
[2:42:38] <peyodogo> and also to differentiate from yours
[2:42:40] <Parapattern> Why Mace Windu's lightsaber purple
[2:42:41] <Ethel9727> It'll probably be explained in a porn spinoff written by Taro or something
[2:42:41] <%coward_man> man this remaster looks real pretty, how's it feel to play?
[2:42:41] <%Maids4lyfe> good point
[2:42:41] <%The_Gaming_Karp> Where wolves?
[2:42:47] <ihavesillyknees> Or maybe its like a jedi Lightsaber you know? Emil just wanted the purple one
[2:42:47] <+emVulpine> Emil's is purple because he demanded Yoko Taro make it purple.
[2:42:48] <%bevyrage> OH GOOD
[2:42:49] <Blank9> clearly because it's lightning elemental, like naruto
[2:42:50] <AoiRob> @PatStaresAt important. after saving the Prince, leave Facade and come back later then talk 1. the guard in front of the prince's house for the ability to traverse the sandstorm, and the advisor on the roof of the mansion to unlock the desert shortcuts
[2:42:51] <%bevyrage> THANKS TUTORIAL
[2:42:54] <%rottingpastry> you unlocked the fighting wolves tutorial congratulations
[2:42:54] <%Jaxnos> get in there, girl
[2:42:55] <Glacierstorm> REPPUKAN
[2:43:03] <%Dakuu75> LOL is she juggling it?
[2:43:05] <%Maids4lyfe> Kaine going ham
[2:43:10] <+Punchasaur> Is she a reference to Cain what with the one eye and all
[2:43:11] <%hoodedlefty> Why isn’t Emil’s magic purple in Automata
[2:43:13] <Laioken13> kaine dont fuck around
[2:43:14] <ihavesillyknees> Emil: There's some WIPEOUTS in his game!
[2:43:15] <Khester824> These wolfies are good boys!
[2:43:17] <+emVulpine> @coward_man The combat is much better (not Nier: Automata levels, but better), while it's otherwise as weird in its design as usual.
[2:43:21] <+D00msDayDan> Kaine is savage
[2:43:22] <Ethel9727> OH I've got it. Kaine's magic is blue because she specced into intelligence instead of faith
[2:43:24] <johnchikr> Waiiiiit there's mansion to desert shortcuts?!
[2:43:26] <AllenDeadman> Kaine chose violence... again
[2:43:41] <Glacierstorm> fighting wolves tutorial: kill them before they kill you
[2:43:45] <Blank9> there's a lot of pyramid shortcuts
[2:43:46] <%RetroCop87> there are also scorpions hidden in the sand near the facade entrance. You'll need their claws for a weapon upgrade
[2:43:47] <ihavesillyknees> Jesus Christ we there yet?
[2:43:50] <%BoxNavy> finally moon2W
[2:43:53] <%Dakuu75> @Ethel9727 stop making good points
[2:43:55] <OswaldTheDog> @allendeadman for Kaine, the only choice is violence
[2:43:58] <goatlord_> Is your refrigerator running
[2:44:00] <%bassoontyphoon> psaDab
[2:44:15] <Blank9> kaine definitely is not specced into int
[2:44:17] <Devbob98> Hope the wolves don’t get her
[2:44:20] <+CursedNobleman> cant get over the naruto runs
[2:44:22] <ihavesillyknees> Oh I like this dungeon
[2:44:25] <+BIumen> weiss: let's go lesbians let's go

[2:52:45] <+ABigPinkLion> you can press alt to walk
[2:52:45] <penitentpendant> You plug in a controller
[2:52:50] <B1G_DADDY_ADAM> use a controller
[2:52:50] <%AgniBrandt> The boxes despawn for a bit if you jump on them
[2:52:51] <Blank9> real yakuza use a gamepad
[2:52:51] <ihavesillyknees> @shieldecho Ah, Weiss is an old boomer
[2:52:51] <%SaiyanShoto> Easy, play with a controller
[2:52:53] <%Maids4lyfe> you install a controller that's now
[2:52:53] <%maybefalco> alt is the keybind to walk on pc
[2:52:55] <%Maids4lyfe> *how
[2:52:55] <%R3Roundabout> Guard walk
[2:52:56] <+ZephynM> Far as I know, this game doesn't want you using a keyboard. I had to go buy a controller.
[2:52:56] <cardamomo88> LUL
[2:53:07] <%linSP> i jumped over the shooty blocks
[2:53:08] <shieldecho> @ihavesillyknees Heh, fair
[2:53:09] <%Jaxnos> yeah, i didn't realize blocking was so busted, i jumped across the blocks
[2:53:17] <%BoxNavy> you. did it.
[2:53:17] <+ShutUpAceyP> use the wirebug to jump over all this
[2:53:25] <+JustToWatch> ***
[2:53:29] <%RetroCop87> don't stop room
[2:53:29] <%MelBrooksKA> I remember you had to install a mod for go keyboard in Automata
[2:53:33] <Sypheck> blocking is almost as good as it was in the original LUL
[2:53:40] <dmtjinni> rate this game / 10
[2:53:42] <m_ccloud> when i did that i was focused on trying to destroy the blocks

[2:54:01] <AllenDeadman> I remember doing this room legit
[2:54:04] <ihavesillyknees> Ridiculously easy
[2:54:07] <Glacierstorm> such a difficult and hard trial
[2:54:12] <+livi242> CAN'T BEAT THE ANCIENT TECH OF JUMPING
[2:54:25] <%RetroCop87> THIS is the don't stop room
[2:54:27] <penitentpendant> This is basically: "Pay attention to what's NOT prohibited"
[2:54:30] <Blank9> I want to see taro legitimately make a zelda spinoff

[2:55:04] <penitentpendant> Air dodge
[2:55:06] <iosephe> They added a jump to FFXIV specifically because of it
[2:55:10] <+emVulpine> To be fair to Pat, I did that and it worked.

[2:59:53] <%Jaxnos> that tutorial is actually handy in a way. goes over combo timing
[2:59:57] <+emVulpine> NieR's amazing tutorial system, remastered for a new generation!
[3:00:01] <%BoxNavy> gottem
[3:00:01] <Sypheck> this is the kind of shit I  thought would be reorganized in this remake
[3:00:06] <%JoshManVGH> I ONLY just got the one about holding down the Options button.
[3:00:08] <majindusto> enigmaNo
[3:00:13] <%SilvaChariot0133> SourPls

[3:00:24] <Sain_127> nvm he ded
[3:00:25] <AllenDeadman> oh
[3:00:37] <+Punchasaur> Conkeldurr
[3:00:38] <%linSP> yooo complex machine
[3:00:40] <Laecerelius> Well then
[3:00:40] <%rottingpastry> combat is gooder
[3:00:42] <%Maids4lyfe> lol
[3:00:48] <zenith0111> POG
[3:00:54] <%rumtumtugnutz> BREAST MODE
[3:00:56] <%BoxNavy> it sure is a later
[3:01:00] <%RigmaroleHM> So does Brother Nier have the same lines as Papa Nier or is he basically a whole new character?
[3:01:13] <+Syznzzz> Hes less angry
[3:01:17] <%Jaxnos> combat is gooder, music is pretty fire-er, more voice work, it pretty
[3:01:18] <%Maids4lyfe> same lines
[3:01:18] <%rottingpastry> some same some different
[3:01:24] <pixelkenj> Lines and tones are written differently sometimes
[3:01:26] <%RigmaroleHM> I miss tired dad
[3:01:27] <%BoxNavy> brother nier doesnt say "its crap!" so hes worse :)
[3:01:30] <%MelBrooksKA> @ShutUpAceyP To quote Pat, when you touch the controls it doesn't make you want to throw up
[3:01:42] <+tetraes> @RigmaroleHM  Its  mainly the same the scripts didnt change between versions
[3:01:44] <+megaman_sentinel> true
[3:01:47] <popcultureaficionado> That combat music was trash I thought Nier had good music.
[3:01:48] <%BoxNavy> cavia jermaPluto
[3:01:54] <%Monkeyweed21> They washed off the Cavia Stink
[3:01:55] <%RigmaroleHM> Ah ok cool
[3:01:55] <Sol_Install> minus boy nier
[3:01:57] <Ninoace> very true
[3:01:57] <+PqperBoy> Worth 60 tho?
[3:02:06] <majindusto> Yes it is the version  we should  have got
[3:02:09] <zenith0111> Nier:Replicant added things that were cut from OG Nier and thats about it
[3:02:09] <+ZipperHands> yes
[3:02:10] <%SilvaChariot0133> absolutely
[3:02:10] <%AzureGale> Time 4 boss
[3:02:15] <Sain_127> KYUBEE
[3:02:15] <tattleworm> this music though
[3:02:15] <+ShutUpAceyP> so then I should be fine playing the ps3 version?
[3:02:16] <%RetroCop87> best music
[3:02:17] <+BIumen> oh baby you hear that brass
[3:02:19] <%rottingpastry> Nier is worth 60 dollarydoos
[3:02:19] <Khester824> Did they bring back cut content?
[3:02:24] <%BoxNavy> @PqperBoy if you can get past the slow start and some tedium then yeah for sure
[3:02:24] <+l_nadex> worth 60 because it shows square we need and want more nier
[3:02:29] <+ZipperHands> it also has new and cut content in this version
[3:02:30] <Sypheck> I still think it could've remedied some of the dumber shit a bit like the weapon grind
[3:02:34] <penitentpendant> Now for Pat to assert his dominance over ROGUE CUBES!
[3:02:36] <%Dakuu75> he fucking fell asleep. that hover-shit must be siper comfy
[3:02:38] <Explodincatz> give me back my cow child!
[3:02:38] <%MelBrooksKA> CUBES!
[3:02:42] <arkv01> they brought back incest?
[3:02:42] <zenith0111> @shutupaceyp This is technically a fuller experience
[3:02:43] <Glacierstorm> prince focaccia?
[3:02:45] <%rumtumtugnutz> @RigmaroleHM It's a different character. This is a remake of the Japanese PS3 version of NieR rather than the Japanese Xbox 360 version they brought over.
[3:02:51] <%king_wragles> Pat, this is a Zelda boss
[3:02:59] <+PqperBoy> no daddy nier :(
[3:03:01] <AllenDeadman> CUBES
[3:03:04] <%AzureGale> LAZOR
[3:03:06] <TioXyco> Gluttony sucks balls yo recover MP?
[3:03:06] <tattleworm> just tap for gluttony, works way better
[3:03:14] <+RealPT1> hey, it's those drakenguard blocks
[3:03:16] <zenith0111> @pqperboy *cough*
[3:03:19] <AllenDeadman> huh...
[3:03:19] <%NitronStreams> KYOOBZ
[3:03:21] <+ShutUpAceyP> i'm guessing pat is playing ps5? i heard there were issues with PC
[3:03:23] <%BoxNavy> SourPls
[3:03:23] <+Macbutters86> I'm not ready for all the sad bits
[3:03:25] <pixelkenj> beeemu
[3:03:26] <+ZipperHands> From what I've heard and seen so far, they basically put some of the novella and other non game stuff into this remaster
[3:03:28] <+livi242> gluttony melts some bosses
[3:03:37] <Oxybe> holy shit... some of the new monhunt gear is wild
[3:03:40] <%rottingpastry> when you find out dark gluttony doesn't suck
[3:03:42] <+tussletoes> so is this thing a dormant drakengard 1 god or what's the deal
[3:03:46] <TioXyco> @ShutUpAceyP unless you cap it at 60, animations go too fast and get wonky
[3:03:54] <%MisterRockett> I don't remember this move?????
[3:03:55] <zenith0111> Dark Gluttony is the speedrun ability
[3:03:56] <%linSP> gluttony is very strong
[3:04:03] <tattleworm> it used to just send out a big orb, they gave it a huge upgrade
[3:04:07] <Sain_127> yeah im playing it rn
[3:04:08] <$Falilth> pfft monhun New mario party update with online is where it's at
[3:04:11] <zenith0111> You can tap Dark Gluttony and not charge it
[3:04:14] <Warbot40> Is Kushala less of a pain with Wirebugs?
[3:04:15] <+D00msDayDan> can you turn anything into layered armor as of the update or is it still asinine?
[3:04:15] <ihavesillyknees> The boss fights in this game are so weirdly charming
[3:04:22] <%Jaxnos> this version of the song is giving me power
[3:04:22] <TioXyco> bonk
[3:04:24] <CaptainCliffQuasar> This is making a super strong impression. Gonna pick this up next check
[3:04:29] <ihavesillyknees> It's not difficult at all, but is charming
[3:04:29] <+BIumen> i used gluttony to take a third of the health off the big lizard shade its crazy
[3:04:30] <%Jaxnos> like end of gurren lagann power
[3:04:31] <+ShutUpAceyP> @TioXyco I'm fine with that. don't need higher than 60. nothings broken is it?
[3:04:34] <%Dakuu75> does Glutony's damage vary on how many orbs you absorb?
[3:04:38] <+Macbutters86> wait. is this  a drakenguard boss, lore wise
[3:04:44] <zenith0111> Tap version works just as well as charge just less mp
[3:04:47] <majindusto> CUBE MAN!!!
[3:04:47] <pixelkenj> theres more than one weak point :)
[3:04:49] <+megaman_sentinel> can't u hit them
[3:04:52] <tattleworm> it's an ultimate muscle boss
[3:04:52] <zenith0111> @dakuu75 Damage of them too
[3:04:53] <+ZipperHands> it's a giant parody of Zelda bosses
[3:04:56] <TioXyco> @ShutUpAceyP as far as I heard, nope, just this. I play on ps4 so... yeah
[3:04:56] <+livi242> @dakuu75 totally
[3:04:57] <penitentpendant> Also, no 'gimmick weapon' you're forced to use. Just your regular mechanics.
[3:05:00] <LeLatte> Yeah this is one of the best game soundtracks I’ve ever heard
[3:05:00] <+tussletoes> the cube things are enemies from drakengard 1
[3:05:02] <ihavesillyknees> Yeah, it's not like a "Place bomb in mouth"
[3:05:08] <%JoshManVGH> So a GOOD Zelda boss
[3:05:09] <%AzureGale> We Yellow Devil now
[3:05:09] <%The_Gaming_Karp> You thought one Cube was tough but what about Giant Man Made of Cubes?
[3:05:12] <+Punchasaur> Pat look out
[3:05:13] <Sain_127> oh shit CatJam
[3:05:13] <+RealPT1> I think it's just assumed these were some remenants that came with the giant and red dragon
[3:05:15] <%rottingpastry> feel like I'm watching the omen
[3:05:20] <%WhereIsWill> SourPls
[3:05:32] <Nupinoop296> i love Kaine
[3:05:37] <%MisterRockett> Is this even a shade? What is this?
[3:05:39] <zenith0111> How do you fight Box God
[3:05:40] <%AzureGale> Kill the shit out of it, but leave the piss in
