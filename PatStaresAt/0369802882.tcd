[0:12:57] <EmpressMoth> easy aiming with the remote :P
[0:13:01] <$HentaiSenpai9K> 4 absolutely needs a remake. But let's wait till the next console generation
[0:13:01] <devanmuse> what they did with MrX in this game is more or less exactly what I pictured them doing with a theoretical Nemesis Remake
[0:13:01] <+future_famous_person> RE4 will probably be timeless
[0:13:02] <djbrooks603> Dude Dino crisis in this style would be rad as shit
[0:13:05] <$Ernor_Woof> cheer300 Dear Pat. I love RE2, but I had a lensectomy (they took the lens out of my right eye) 2 weeks ago, so I'm watching you enjoy it for me. Thanks for the entertainment. Also, Jill or Claire?

[0:13:14] <$SGrim> Fucking JohnTron just uploaded rooKek
[0:13:16] <%ElenaManetta> These gift subs should just be "PERSON GIFTED A SHIT TON OF SUBS"
[0:13:17] <ScreamingMeat> RE4 should get the Halo 1/2 treatment. Where everything is the same but it has a massive graphical boost

[0:20:53] <AMajorTom> Locker-chan is crying
[0:20:53] <$Ernor_Woof> The sparkshot looks like a nerf gun o.o
[0:20:54] <$SubjectTea> ah man, i missed so much after going to bed at 11:30 last night
[0:20:55] <haisho> speaking of which have you seen Max's progress with Hardcore? He's getting his ass kicked HARD

[0:20:59] <%ThatGuyfromMars> @ForgetfulUthanasiast huge stun gun
[0:21:01] <EmpressMoth> Check the tape @AngriestPat
[0:21:02] <$ooblagis> RE2 was hudless
[0:21:02] <%ElenaManetta> heyyyy YOU'RE RIGHT
[0:21:03] <waifoong98> Well like 7?
[0:21:06] <+future_famous_person> hudless
[0:21:06] <PrincessPeachTheLurk> sprry im late! how many hours is pat into clairs playthrough?
[0:21:08] <ForgetfulUthanasiast> Ooh, cool!
[0:21:09] <%lewdskeletor13> I like it
[0:21:09] <VanLynx> HUD-less
[0:21:09] <Kenny_Riot> The Dual Shock 4 is the health bar
[0:21:10] <%ArcanumMBD> @AngriestPat Is there a difference between the 2 pistols when using basic 9mm rounds?
[0:21:11] <%Aydarkzero> gives me a nice Dead Space feel
[0:21:11] <Grandbeekman1> But where's the healthbar?
[0:21:12] <%ElenaManetta> is there an option to keep it on?
[0:21:12] <%notjustagamer> Oh yeah never noticed that
[0:21:15] <+runegod20> there's no mini map and you only see health when you pause or take damage
[0:21:17] <+MagicianV3> @Scharfster hudless theres no hard locked ui just sitting on screen
[0:21:17] <hsp_hiram> it's the bug-a-salt from that one infomercial.
[0:21:18] <acrobaticballerina> Weapon number
[0:21:20] <%Laecerelius> You should remove your hud control chip. It'll free up some space for sweet combat upgrades
[0:21:21] <%cvp5127> clean
[0:21:22] <%ArtemisCroc> this games retained a lot of the best UI stuff from RE7 @AngriestPat
[0:21:24] <%MightyMaxT> Even the locker?
[0:21:24] <%Aleate> Weapon number? Does this gun shoot guns too? Kappa
[0:21:25] <americashypest> have you checked the just chatting section yet?
[0:21:26] <Kenny_Riot> The light on it goes from Green to Yellow to Red based on damage
[0:21:29] <+runegod20> no objective markers or compus
[0:21:29] <%queaks> No hud instantly makes your game look better
[0:21:30] <Yjayr> They should have remade RE3 first. The best of the RE games.
[0:21:30] <%valriot> HUD is garish as fuck, top corner minimaps are eye searing, people just dont realise
[0:21:31] <$Ernor_Woof> how do I donate to pat, chat?
[0:21:32] <%Niney_Who> @AngriestPat Apparently your Controller is a healthbar too
[0:21:36] <%lewdskeletor13> CHECK THE LOCKEE

[0:28:59] <%Rawklobstah88> Because eyeballs are creepy
[0:29:00] <%valriot> Cos its from Bloodborne
[0:29:00] <%FracturedImage> because metaphors
[0:29:01] <%bestwaifuritsu> Because eyeballs are the most exposed organ
[0:29:02] <Prevot> cause they made the virus watch Naruto
[0:29:02] <MyNameIsRasus> Because it yearns for the insight
[0:29:02] <+TheGodfrey> It wants that sweet insight
[0:29:03] <FearTheWorm> Oh my God. A fake OS that actually looks like an OS.

[0:29:05] <waifoong98> "bc SHARINGAN" Kappa
[0:29:05] <jobbedbone> that email client looks like material UI

[0:29:07] <%Laecerelius> @AngriestPat It's obviously an evolved version of pinkeye!
[0:29:07] <+Ilpala271> oops, all eyeballs
[0:29:08] <+Yokuho> @AngriestPat Eyes on the inside and all that
[0:29:08] <%SaltyDongs> the g-virus killed it's clan

[0:29:08] <Zaphire_Saucypants> eyeballs fo daaaaayz
[0:29:08] <%MightyMaxT> Okay, so question. When Claire is in a different costume, you think Sherry gets a different modeled jacket on her?
[0:29:09] <Plaidstone> Chocabloc eyeballs
[0:29:09] <reddeadwine1277> G virus=the old blood
[0:29:10] <+BorinCorran> Interesting to see these differences since I picked Leon first.
[0:29:11] <%notjustagamer> Eye on the inside or rather outside
[0:29:11] <dukenux> Because it's eww and ick, Pat
[0:29:11] <PSI_Guy95> It stands for "Gee I wish I could see better"
[0:29:11] <TangledVirus> Maybe something with the corneas?
[0:29:12] <%JJCheeker> It loves those eyeballs
[0:29:13] <%BourneWarrior> GRANT US EYES
[0:29:13] <%oAznoUta> G-Virus. G for Gamer Goo Kappa
[0:29:13] <+Varnarok> Because eyes are big spoops

[0:29:14] <+Genocalypse> The G virus gives you eyes on the inside, and out!
[0:29:14] <blackbookalpha> Pat blind

[0:29:21] <twentysix_37> pat, the heart on the outside is from surgery!
[0:29:22] <+TDotGoat> the G stands for Googly
[0:29:23] <JoeyDDT> G = Giant Eyeball
[0:29:23] <EmpressMoth> RE1 shows Lisa Trevor as a predecessor for G @AngriestPat
[0:29:24] <devanmuse> because it looks cool
[0:29:24] <Darmarock> Some real life viruses like to target specific organs too
[0:29:24] <%lewdskeletor13> STRESS GO UP

[0:29:33] <+MonsieurHedge> maybe it just propagates well in vitreous fluid?
[0:29:33] <%xsnowfox> 'Gee i wish i could see better' is the best thing i've read all day
[0:29:34] <yourbuddycarl> Ada's blood?

[0:39:03] <DarkKnightGrave> Yoshikage Pat just wants his grenade back.
[0:39:04] <waifoong98> Makes sense Kappa
[0:39:07] <haisho> that's because they are

[0:39:16] <Amasepyt> Normal mode zombies get stronger depending on how well you play
[0:39:17] <%Engwithan_Elder_God> Better placed maybe.
[0:39:17] <Scharfster> Sometimes they just have a buest of speed
[0:39:17] <qwaar37> wait, why cant the zombies open the doors? Where are their wristbands?
[0:39:17] <%Reizie_Etherealm> Or maybe you're slower
[0:39:17] <DonatelloJose> @GohanEgret whoa you're not even wrong.
[0:39:18] <SaltyAzteca> Dont they vary in speeds?
[0:39:18] <Prevot> maybe you're getting worse

[1:14:38] <reddeadwine1277> "Good Morning, Julia!"
[1:14:38] <Lieutenant_America> Area full of enemies only killable with fire means he now doesn't want to use them at all

[2:10:07] <%willjar313> @jiin6 He wanted to go home to his family (family... family...)
[2:10:07] <%konekoryugamine> RE2 he came back TWICE! And now he DRIVES the school bus!
[2:10:08] <+BorinCorran> I mean...I did.
[2:10:08] <jackktrue> @AngriestPat Has Paige even played RE2 yet?
[2:10:08] <scottishwolf> No boss dies until it's hit by an RPG - this is the RE rule.
[2:10:09] <%Laecerelius> So much handgun ammo
[2:10:10] <+KiingDominator> its not if your not pat
[2:10:10] <+blackkanye> I mean I finished off G1 with teh handgun
[2:10:10] <%SinisterWang> only big dick G's do that
[2:10:11] <%Sphincter_Spelunker> Boss attack animations sure look dumb. The most video gamey shit I've seen in this
[2:10:11] <PSI_Guy95> gotta save your ammo for later, use the handgun
[2:10:12] <+Ilpala271> do it tho
[2:10:12] <+TheImmortal70> @angriestpat It is SUPER necessary on hardcore
[2:10:15] <The_Blumper> IT WOULD BE COOL
[2:10:15] <Valdorick> Just upgrade the handgun, duh
[2:10:17] <%valriot> MUGNUM
[2:10:17] <+runegod20> what if you didn't get the SMG or grenade launcher
[2:10:19] <Hanbei1708> Bilkins takes off the costume and it was Mr X underneath all along
[2:10:22] <%President_Miyazaki> How's that wild? It has big glowing weakpoints to shoot.
[2:10:23] <%ToneBacas> here piss at the boss why don't you
[2:10:23] <%Kahnicus> That is generous helpings of handgun ammo
[2:10:25] <Flamekidx> mmm, delicious toxic fumes
[2:10:25] <Sedrelic> is not if you can aim
[2:10:26] <%konekoryugamine> Yo
[2:10:26] <@mothmandraws> knife only run
[2:10:27] <vingadivo> better than the fucking zapping gun
[2:10:31] <+Grayhammatter> yeah, OR THE eyes
[2:10:32] <zafooru> zapping system is too weak
[2:10:32] <dking0000> Big viral monsters live by Yakuza rules, only death in a big dumb cutscene can occur
[2:10:33] <KiroKadura> post boss loot
[2:10:34] <+This_is_marco> I mean bullets are pretty effective against eyes
[2:10:35] <Megapikman132> Yeah
[2:10:35] <$Ravemouse> I fought the boss with a handgun
[2:10:36] <dukenux> It's especially powerful against Birkin things
[2:10:37] <Megapikman132> For sure.
[2:10:40] <ForgetfulUthanasiast> It's to lull the idiots into a false sense of scrublessness
[2:10:42] <%TamsynRRD> He didn't blow up into chunky salsa. It ain't over.
[2:10:45] <%Shillk> tofu-chan has a hard life @mothmandraws
[2:10:49] <%konekoryugamine> Use the guns and smaller bullets for the eyes, then go big for those chest eyes
[2:10:51] <thatd00doverthere> theres no way THAT guy is coming back
[2:10:51] <DesuDesuDokiDoki> 25min ish
[2:10:52] <%xsnowfox> hope we never see THAT guy again.
[2:10:52] <%konekoryugamine> CHesites
[2:10:53] <+runegod20> the shock works much better in the early phase when he doesn't chain attacks
[2:10:54] <LandOfTheWay> more like half a minute, probably
[2:10:54] <%konekoryugamine> Chesties
[2:10:56] <SpydaMan_SLiM> Does every gun do the same damage or something? lmao (Obcious sarcasm)
[2:10:56] <+Nomicro4u> If only there was a sand gun
[2:10:57] <outis94> what if mr x was piloting birkin allong?

[2:11:17] <vingadivo> how many times do you fight berkin on the original?
[2:11:23] <jackktrue> @StatistX Mr. X is dead
[2:11:23] <Longfang91> It's a shame G monsters can't rip their shirt off and show their big ol' back tattoo before a fight.
[2:11:24] <%konekoryugamine> @vingadivo About three times
[2:11:25] <+Grayhammatter> SHERRY!
[2:11:26] <+mastertwin2> cryJundus
[2:11:27] <%lewdskeletor13> Mr X got fucked
[2:11:27] <%jiin6> Knives having life bars would make knife only runs really hard
[2:11:29] <Hanbei1708> yes guys we have seen mr x die

[2:11:45] <Hanbei1708> X is fucking dead kids go to the VOD
[2:11:47] <devanmuse> Mister X got disemboweled by Birkin. He's dead... or he's just spending his time messing with Leon on the other side of the lab
[2:11:48] <+MeatBomb> Is Mr. X a pun on misdirects?
[2:11:48] <$ooblagis> X got Birkined
[2:11:48] <+Crazybrooklyn> grouphug everyone
[2:11:50] <%konekoryugamine> @SirSmudgey Acid

[2:11:52] <Grandbeekman1> Bring back Xwa
[2:11:53] <%Meiou> @KangarooCyborg well ofcourse she is. pat didnt stand still for the shower
[2:11:55] <%bestwaifuritsu> @jiin6 destroying the racoon statues gives you an infinite knife
[2:11:56] <+trashamn> i feel like the laser pointer pistol would be better for bosses due to the maga capacty
[2:11:58] <%JJCheeker> Sherry probably end boss Kappa
[2:12:02] <%DZiffer> If only you could make mor SMG rounds, HMMMM
[2:12:03] <%StatistX> ok thanks. I think I remember this game wrong, cause it felt like he was always around back in the original
[2:12:03] <%Youwereeatenbyalid> @Hanbei1708 you don't know that he could always come back
[2:12:05] <PopulousNix> dump a stack o grenades?
[2:12:06] <Bakefowl> @sirsmudgey Cutscene acid
[2:12:08] <dragoon001914> There should be 5 more X's in Raccoon City
[2:12:08] <+moondog_> put away nades
[2:12:09] <em0t10nalr3ck> Claire must smell like Ellie aka garbage
[2:12:12] <Zambambino_> knife only run when
[2:12:12] <Ugato> the Infiknife
[2:12:13] <%konekoryugamine> Boo
[2:12:13] <GyroBigHugs> So no super tyrant boss? Or is that in Leon's campaign
[2:12:19] <%ThatGuyfromMars> @trashamn probably better for aiming too
[2:12:19] <DesuDesuDokiDoki> you dont need 6 grenades
[2:12:20] <Fujiwara_92> EVERY GUN
[2:12:21] <%konekoryugamine> INFINIDAGGER
[2:12:22] <Hellarussian> Leons sick hair will be the final boss
[2:12:22] <+moondog_> PUT AWAY NADES
[2:12:24] <%skizzuto> too much grenades and handgun ammo
[2:12:24] <%konekoryugamine> HADTODOIT
[2:12:25] <limeATthechannel> hard mode ??
[2:12:26] <%lewdskeletor13> @statistx It’s different in Leon’s campaign
[2:12:26] <Hanbei1708> @Youwereeatenbyalid god i hope it'd be so hype
[2:12:27] <$SleepyMaribo> grab the rest of the machine gun ammo
[2:12:28] <$ooblagis> You have 6 nades
[2:12:31] <%Laecerelius> Yeah put away one of your groups of grenades
[2:12:37] <+runegod20> you wouldn't really be able to aim your shots during bosses so the brownin would be better outside magnum shots
[2:12:39] <%MelBrooksKA> @Hanbei1708 I don't know what I saw, it could even have been Mr. X dying spyCappa apatJpeg
[2:12:39] <%ArcanumMBD> I feel like 6 nades is overkill
[2:12:40] <uma_sariwa> Whats Pats PC specs?
[2:12:42] <%Meiou> @konekoryugamine this isnt shovel knight XP
[2:12:43] <%D_day> Ryu's Samurai Ghost Army is the true final boss

[2:54:44] <PSI_Guy95> Pat missed something?
[2:54:44] <%jiin6> i think Leon A covers that

[3:01:27] <+zaworldo> HE MISSED IT TWICE
[3:01:29] <ventus_fury> NOOOOOO!
[3:01:30] <FlyguyJP> Marvin is probably super dead
[3:01:30] <+chaumiester> Now I'm curious. What Weapon does Claire get on Claire B?
[3:01:32] <+Answer_Moose> There was a thing on the wall back there pat
[3:01:33] <SpydaMan_SLiM> Can you make .45 now?
[3:01:36] <+TheImmortal70> Ye
[3:01:37] <Sinister_Aglet> pat the locker
[3:01:38] <DesuDesuDokiDoki> yes?
[3:01:38] <+zaworldo> Yes

[3:01:39] <+KiingDominator> pat the switch
[3:01:39] <$ooblagis> Probably
[3:01:40] <haisho> yeah it does and there's a good reason
[3:01:40] <%lewdskeletor13> THIS IS HYPE
[3:01:42] <FirewallStorm> yes
[3:01:42] <Thanatoast250> Check to see if Marvin's alive
[3:01:42] <%lebuusch> yes
[3:01:44] <hassanico> MOIRE CRITICALS
[3:01:44] <+nezunskyfire> You missed a panel
[3:01:45] <+TheImmortal70> It's pretty much like an upgraded pistol
[3:01:46] <+runegod20> well it's a bigger caliber so it should be
[3:01:47] <%gigglefists> yes but not full auto like Matilda
[3:01:48] <jackktrue> Yeah it hits much harder
[3:01:48] <kratosdestroys> Probably
[3:01:48] <CaptainFrankincense> it fucks
[3:01:49] <%AirlineFood74> 3
[3:01:50] <+TheImmortal70> But it's SUPER SUPER inaccurate

[3:02:04] <person181> yes
[3:02:05] <+RC_S3kshun8> well I mean it's a .45 vs a 9mm, larger sluck slower velocity imparts more kinetic energey. IRL anyway @AngriestPat

[3:03:31] <%Doster503> Pat that was sick apatSmug apatMenace apatMenace apatMenace
[3:03:35] <TyrantBelial> @AngriestPat Don't forget you took all the item pouches as Claire, so who knows if you'll get a aingle pouch as Leon.

[3:03:54] <bursky00> @The_Butterfly_Man it's better when one handing a gun, less recoil strain in ur wrist.
[3:03:56] <Darren716> Anyone know if the MUGNUM parts are still in?
[3:03:56] <tri3dgE027> Belt Pouches don't carry over?

[3:04:11] <Kingdom_65> @TyrantBelial He probably will, things like that will most likely show up in the same place or alternate areas.
[3:04:12] <bearalin> Blam! Blam! Leon ain’t messing around
[3:04:12] <%ThatGuyfromMars> @Darren716 it's fixed tho
[3:04:13] <VritraReiRei> @AngriestPat can you explain how to zapping system is supposed to work? because this looks a lot like a TOTALLY different playthrough and not something that should be happening the same time as Claire's
[3:04:13] <%slothslayer828> where da hood at?
[3:04:14] <Darren716> As the mugnum parts?

[3:04:58] <$ooblagis> What a trooper
[3:05:00] <Flamekidx> I like that the recoil goes to the left because of the way he's holding it
[3:05:01] <+Grayhammatter> no spade key boyo
[3:05:01] <+GenesisKnight> Shit's locked
[3:05:04] <%gigglefists> language!
[3:05:05] <%13ry4n93> Zombie's being able to survive fire doesn't make sense to me
[3:05:06] <alexandrecau> leon: what the hell is wrong with you
[3:05:08] <SpydaMan_SLiM> No wandedr leon isnt stars look how he holds the gun lol
[3:05:11] <hassanico> licker?
[3:05:13] <Guardiansaiyan> LICKER room
[3:05:17] <Longfang91> So is it just me or did anyone else the 1911 to sound a bit beefier
[3:05:17] <MegaFangKing23> That zombie needs to...chill out. :)
[3:05:18] <$ooblagis> There's the keycard
[3:05:18] <GohanEgret> l i c c
[3:05:19] <jobbedbone> dmx was released from jail as a tie in with this game?
[3:05:20] <+Answer_Moose> big traps
[3:05:22] <UPTONOGOOD18> why does a trained cop hold his gun sideways
[3:05:23] <DesuDesuDokiDoki> l i c c c
[3:05:25] <majindusto> Oh Boy
[3:05:28] <%DirtyGaijin> Lewd
[3:05:29] <%gigglefists> pat get the L I C C
[3:05:29] <%13ry4n93> but granted that's probably just because zombies in general don't really work
[3:05:32] <+glock36> Is this game better played on keyboard and mouse or game pad?
[3:05:32] <LordDominus> so does this one live up to the hype?
[3:05:38] <Valdorick> So... why did they never clean out the Art Room anyway? This shit belongs in a museum.
[3:05:39] <%lewdskeletor13> @uptonogood18 Cause it’s bad ass
[3:05:40] <alexandrecau> zombie should be able to survive anything, death doesn't kill them
[3:05:41] <Kingdom_65> @UPTONOGOOD18 It's a reference to his old costumes in the original game.
[3:05:43] <majindusto> Yes
[3:05:44] <%lebuusch> keycard
[3:05:47] <%xsnowfox> the hype is well founded yes
[3:05:47] <BlitzChocula> Capcom broke DMX outta jail and let him loose on the streets of America in a full Mr. X trenchcoat.
[3:05:48] <+AllenDeadman> PAT
[3:05:49] <%joylent_blue> LordDominus yes
[3:05:49] <+tigerfang86> JUST ON FIRE
[3:05:52] <+tigerfang86> HE'S SO ON FIRE
[3:05:53] <+ateliermorgan> because he's an american cop and american cops are very bad shots :P
[3:05:53] <%willjar313> Licker? I hardly KNOW her!

[3:06:01] <MegaFangKing23> This is fine. :)
[3:06:01] <Acidshocker> Wait, I missed something, is there or is there not a "B" story?
[3:06:03] <streamtouched> Did he notice watchmen gate open
[3:06:06] <%13ry4n93> I feel like if the zombies are that on fire they shouldn't be moving much or at all
[3:06:07] <%DirtyGaijin> @LordDominus yes, especially if you are a fan of the originals
[3:06:08] <+tiwddle> this is the B story
[3:06:08] <%Sphincter_Spelunker> @Valdorick The Police Department WAS a museum
[3:06:09] <Guardiansaiyan> z@ac
[3:06:10] <reddeadwine1277> "Errybody go night night!"

[3:06:13] <%lewdskeletor13> @acidshocker This is B story
[3:06:13] <hassanico> @Acidshocker this is B story
[3:06:13] <Kingdom_65> @Acidshocker He's currently playing Leon B
[3:06:14] <majindusto> MAN on FIRE
[3:06:14] <%AirlineFood74> @Acidshocker he's playing leon's B scenario right now
[3:06:14] <$ooblagis> Jesus
[3:06:16] <Guardiansaiyan> @Acidshocker this is the B story
[3:06:17] <%psychodave1234> did he unlock his desk?
[3:06:20] <Fwamingdwagon12> they love it
[3:06:20] <%DZiffer> Can't you use the thing on the security door thing in the back?
[3:06:21] <VritraReiRei> @lewdskeletor13 but each character has to get bolt cutters to open the same door, items are in the same location regardless if they were picked up or not. so far the two scenarios don't seem to affect each other
[3:06:22] <+TheImmortal70> Because FUCK YOU
[3:06:22] <tri3dgE027> unique variant
[3:06:24] <DesuDesuDokiDoki> its a life choice

[3:13:45] <lloyddboy> racoon
[3:13:46] <%xsnowfox> i've got tiny girly wrists but from my experience firing a pistol, holding a gun like that just seems like it'd hurt for anyone,
[3:13:49] <+TheApostles101> Do it
[3:13:50] <Kingdom_65> @joylent_blue I doubt DMC5 spoilers are gonna be a thing considering the game hasn't leaked 2 months early. Kappa
[3:13:50] <godzookylives> I am very glad you encounter Mr. X in both campaigns
[3:13:50] <+TheWallOfMeat> Is there a way of knowing how many people are actively using chat, as opposed to the total viewer count?
[3:13:50] <$ooblagis> Claire B gets a cowboy gun
[3:13:51] <%xsnowfox> ;;;;
[3:13:51] <tacostarvedbeast> That’s not Clair you silly goose
[3:13:53] <DesuDesuDokiDoki> hide in teh bushes hehe
[3:13:55] <%milhousego> GET THAT OTHER BOARD
[3:13:57] <%Youwereeatenbyalid> I mean 3 obviously
[3:13:59] <%gigglefists> guys that's just a trooper hat. it's not Mr x's
[3:14:01] <$ooblagis> She shoots it like Revolver Ocelot
[3:14:02] <%lewdskeletor13> Mr Raccoon hates when you shoot him!
[3:14:10] <%DirtyGaijin> Surely holding it like that just increases the chance of you breaking your face with the recoil
[3:14:24] <%xsnowfox> or dropping it or aiming poorly;;;;
[3:14:24] <haisho> can't you just hold the boards until a zombie is actually at a window?
[3:14:24] <%Big_Dream> just play
[3:14:25] <%hussdogrob> @ooblagis cowboy guns arent good enough we need hats for full on gay cowboy dante
[3:14:28] <EmpressMoth> Board one of them up @AngriestPat
[3:14:28] <+Grayhammatter> just board them all 4Head
[3:14:29] <%lewdskeletor13> @dirtygaijin Nah it’s just badass

[3:14:30] <GohanEgret> tap out Kappa
[3:14:31] <DesuDesuDokiDoki> board one to free inventory
[3:14:31] <%Engwithan_Elder_God> Board what you can
[3:14:32] <+runegod20> probably one window at either end of the hallow
[3:14:32] <+Answer_Moose> The one near the middle of the hallways imo
[3:14:33] <Kingdom_65> @DirtyGaijin Well, no. Most people don't have a limp grip when shooting a gun.
[3:14:33] <%xsnowfox> RAM RANCH
[3:14:33] <$Ernor_Woof> But the zombies need to know how GANSTA Leon is
[3:14:34] <+tiwddle> there's a box missing a fuse
[3:14:35] <majindusto> JUST PLAY
[3:14:37] <+chaumiester> @xsnowfox No, you would just be inaccurate, it wouldn't hurt. Unless you don't know how to hold a gun properly
[3:14:37] <energywarning> the one closest the save room
[3:14:37] <Fujiwara_92> JUST BOARD ONE
[3:14:38] <em0t10nalr3ck> Board them up ya goof

[3:14:49] <TyrantBelial> SHOOT. THE GLASS.
[3:14:49] <CorkscrewCross> Investigate the police station
[3:14:52] <%DirtyGaijin> @lewdskeletor13 if anyone could pull it off , its leon
[3:14:53] <%AncelDeLambert> board whatever gives you the largest amount of corridor space
[3:14:54] <AmericanaRed> wrong move
[3:14:56] <%valriot> Pat, youll barely use that room
[3:14:58] <+michingmallecho> When in doubt, board it out

[3:17:39] <donkymagooterson> holding a gun like that makes good sense at short range - no sense at long range
[3:17:39] <%fattness132> @AngriestPat by not wearing those headphones you're making yourself super spacially unaware pat
[3:17:40] <%13ry4n93> it seems like a decent enough gun
[3:17:41] <%Brandon__Brando> wow this game looks great
[3:17:43] <+OnyxTyrant> Man his police station is even more dangerous

[3:17:55] <+chaumiester> @ghostkingwho 1911.... or as the game calls it, the M19
[3:17:56] <Zansatsu0379> 1911 is always best gun-chan, just like MGS3.
[3:17:59] <%DZiffer> This game is amazing, isn't it?
[3:18:00] <hassanico> @ghostkingwho M19
[3:18:01] <majindusto> THEY DO IT

[3:18:37] <%xsnowfox> leon helps anyone with their ED, let's be real
[3:18:37] <+zetsubougg> i never played the original re2, did they make the second playthrough like a completly different campaign?
[3:18:40] <%Youwereeatenbyalid> @Northward12 THEY DO IT
[3:18:40] <+runegod20> so all the item spawns are about the same
[3:18:43] <Josef_Stryker> Wait so IS there a Zapping system in the Remake?
[3:18:47] <VritraReiRei> Where's Marvin D:
[3:18:47] <$ooblagis> ???
[3:18:49] <hassanico> yes
[3:18:49] <reddeadwine1277> Leon must pull *them* to the bullet, and push it through them.
[3:18:49] <+Grayhammatter> why not?
[3:18:49] <jackktrue> we gotta get em again wut?
[3:18:51] <$ooblagis> You kind of have to
[3:18:55] <Stillchr> B side is the other characters perspective
[3:18:55] <%Ahack13> @Youwereeatenbyalid Leon/claire a/b, Hunk and Tofu.
[3:18:55] <nobody12349> @Josef_Stryker Yes
[3:18:55] <dekkitout> when i first heard the word 'remaster' in context to videogames, this is the kind of thing i have in mind
[3:18:56] <em0t10nalr3ck> I'm more of a fan of Beretta Chan but 1911 Chan is cute too
[3:18:56] <Longfang91> @13ry4n93 It's a big, heavy round, right?
[3:18:56] <%DetroitSentai> Its not zapping
[3:18:56] <DesuDesuDokiDoki> aww

[3:19:08] <DesuDesuDokiDoki> is it the same?
[3:19:08] <sykehm> Question: I get what the zapping system is, one scenario affects the other but; why is it called the "zapping" system?
[3:19:08] <%PetsPlay> was re2 the one with claires butt shot?

[3:26:11] <+AllenDeadman> she used to be thicc
[3:26:13] <%Laecerelius> She wants that sweet boy booty!
[3:26:19] <SnaKemuho> she kinda looks like the girl from RE7
[3:26:19] <connorhawk> these guns are so weak
[3:26:19] <%oKentucky> banging her at any time is necrophilia
[3:26:22] <AmanDotZip> thicc op
[3:26:24] <DesuDesuDokiDoki> pop
[3:26:25] <reddeadwine1277> poor, poor, thicc mommas
[3:26:27] <$ooblagis> SHOTGUN
[3:26:27] <%Sphincter_Spelunker> begone thot
[3:26:28] <%AirlineFood74> @max_radical it's just by using the 1911
[3:26:30] <%DirtyGaijin> nothing can keep the women away from leon
[3:26:33] <%BourneWarrior> SHOTGUN
[3:26:34] <%nofestu2> sonofabitchuu
[3:26:34] <%13ry4n93> @Laecerelius every one wants leon's booty
[3:26:35] <+valkuma> if you think its bad in this , hardcore requires like 10 headshots per zombie to kill
[3:26:37] <BlitzChocula> if she groans, she's a thot.
[3:26:40] <+valkuma> AND ammo is limited at the same time
[3:26:41] <em0t10nalr3ck> I bet she was a real banger when she was alive
[3:26:41] <%Laecerelius> True enough
[3:26:42] <+WaywardSera> @DirtyGaijin not even death
[3:26:43] <MegaFangKing23> Language Leon! SwiftRage
[3:26:43] <%MightyMaxT> Item box?
[3:26:44] <%ThePuddingDead> I love how their heads split open like canteloupes
[3:26:44] <+predac0n> the bullet sponginess of the Zambos feels like it's TOO much
[3:26:44] <max_radical> @AirlineFood74 and do you just get that for doing claire a/leon b?
[3:26:48] <%ThatGuyfromMars> @valkuma fuck that
[3:26:49] <+blastazoid26> This game is giving me BIG anxiety
[3:26:49] <reddeadwine1277> she wants that supple Leon body
[3:26:50] <%xsnowfox> no! all zombies are queens!!!
[3:26:54] <connorhawk> 10!!! geezers
[3:26:57] <+fizzguy47> isn't this the gun that snake always has an orgasm over
[3:27:00] <+GenesisKnight> upgrade Matilda
[3:27:02] <tmix1600> How much of a pacist run can you do in this?
[3:27:03] <VritraReiRei> @AngriestPat so how do you like the NEW Zapping System?
[3:27:04] <+VanaSkiller> 1911 big work
[3:27:07] <+Ryuuken1789> doodLoen doodLoen doodLoen
[3:27:11] <GohanEgret> oh yeah that music
[3:27:14] <em0t10nalr3ck> @fizzguy47 Yes
[3:27:14] <SpydaMan_SLiM> @AngriestPat Does normal ammo work with that gun?
[3:27:17] <+valkuma> tmix1600 lickers make it hard but in general you can bait most zombies.
[3:27:21] <%AirlineFood74> @max_radical Claire A. It's in Brad's panic room at the beginning of Leon B
[3:27:23] <%MisterCrimson> key card for shotty?
[3:27:25] <%ThatGuyfromMars> @SpydaMan_SLiM nah it's got it's own ammo
[3:27:26] <%smoketrash> bolt cutters
[3:27:27] <forlorncarton> upgrade matilda
[3:27:28] <%13ry4n93> so does pat have any plans for doing KH3?
[3:27:32] <Megapikman132> Might as well updgrade it.
[3:27:33] <%lewdskeletor13> @predac0n It depends on your aim largely, I’ve downed a zombie in two with careful shots
[3:27:33] <EmpressMoth> Cutting tool
[3:27:35] <%ThePuddingDead> may as well attach that thing to Matilda. be done with it

[3:54:57] <Coystick> Oh lawd he cummin
[3:54:59] <DonatelloJose> @mendin no, we were upset
[3:55:00] <+tiwddle> The only things that are 100% the same are the locker and safe codes
[3:55:02] <%gigglefists> one time he busted through a wall. another time he didn't
[3:55:03] <%ThePuddingDead> in A yeah
[3:55:03] <+Grayhammatter> and a battery
[3:55:04] <+runegod20> they built it around sequence breaking which is kind of cool
[3:55:04] <AnApatheticAndroid> !streamtime
[3:55:06] <+ginger__gaming__> Thump Thump Thump
[3:55:06] <ssks123> you need the battery remember
[3:55:06] <applesonthemoon> one could say mr. x is an ..... x factor
[3:55:07] <Crimson_Scion> Rebecca photo is life.
[3:55:07] <jackktrue> Is Mr. X there yet?
[3:55:10] <%AirlineFood74> @DZiffer yup, yesterday
[3:55:11] <%oKentucky> @AngriestPat KILL EVERYTHING
[3:55:12] <Valdorick> !uptime
[3:55:12] <@Moobot> I've been playing this game for how long? Oh only 3h 55m.
[3:55:13] <%DirtyGaijin> @Mendin Thoery is he will be in this run
[3:55:14] <haisho> oh boy it's time isn't it
[3:55:14] <%roobanguy> oh shit leon gets a 1911?
[3:55:15] <PSI_Guy95> before Mr X just chased you endlessly didn't he? I remember he wasn't around only a few times
[3:55:16] <+tiwddle> The medallion puzzles are randomized
[3:55:16] <$Mendin> I mean he only lost 60% of his torso, I thought he was less of a bitch than that
[3:55:23] <converterv2> Just your average everyday masterpiece thats a remake.
[3:55:23] <%hussdogrob> @applesonthemoon apatSmug
[3:55:27] <%DZiffer> @AirlineFood74 Nice
[3:55:27] <lloyddboy> shh don't tell him
[3:55:27] <%ThatGuyfromMars> pat's gotta go to stars anyways cause the battery's there
[3:55:29] <%Shindeil> Is he playing on Xbone or PC?
[3:55:29] <majindusto> ROLL OUT!
[3:55:31] <+MyDarkStorm> oh wait you have to go forgot
[3:55:33] <GohanEgret> PC
[3:55:34] <forlorncarton> ammo by stairs
[3:55:36] <%AirlineFood74> PC
[3:55:39] <%lewdskeletor13> L I C C
[3:55:41] <%Shindeil> Good choice
[3:55:41] <arcaderabbit48> @Mendin We might seem more of him with Leon?
[3:55:43] <%ThatGuyfromMars> @Shindeil PC
[3:55:47] <PSI_Guy95> Imagine if it just showed a item in the room Mr X was to get you to go there as a ruse
[3:55:49] <DesuDesuDokiDoki> LUL
[3:55:49] <Zaphire_Saucypants> maaaaan
[3:55:51] <%ThePuddingDead> thats....unsettling
[3:55:51] <Valdorick> I mean, it makes sense, Birkin lost 1154% of his eyeballs and stayed alive @Mendin
[3:55:53] <$Mendin> Here's hoping
[3:55:56] <%Sphincter_Spelunker> Claire took em all
[3:55:56] <+MyDarkStorm> Clarie
[3:55:56] <$Ernor_Woof> C for what? ;D
[3:55:58] <%DirtyGaijin> Don't use it all at once
[3:56:00] <%jiin6> free bullets better than NONE
[3:56:01] <sileo_patronus> make them count asshole
[3:56:01] <C_S_N_G> Better than 2
[3:56:02] <%Zaxshimysham> that's the number 3 Pat
[3:56:03] <Longfang91> Mmore powerful gun, less bullets needed?
[3:56:03] <MutedMimic> monkaS
[3:56:04] <%ThatGuyfromMars> Yeah I've been getting three bullets in my leon run too
[3:56:04] <TeethandHunger> We’ll “see” Mr. X before we see him
[3:56:08] <+runegod20> 3 .45 bullets can do way more than like 5 9MM, especailly if you let it do the bonus damage
[3:56:10] <TeethandHunger> Welcome to the low ammo show with your host: Leon
[3:56:10] <a_mad_dragon> claire bogarted the bullets
[3:56:11] <%Laecerelius> They seem to go a lot farther than the 9mm ones
[3:56:13] <%slothslayer828> take a bath
[3:56:16] <converterv2> You have to learn the value of each one to appreciate them
[3:56:18] <%DZiffer> He's just hanging out
[3:56:19] <+gerenago> this is leon B right?
[3:56:21] <%st_judge> I'm glad Claire set him back up to spook Leon
[3:56:22] <%AirlineFood74> yes
[3:56:22] <IminyourBase> paul was nothing but consistent
[3:56:22] <Wibit> Claire was an ammo hog
[3:56:24] <+MyDarkStorm> Blame Clarie Pat
[3:56:24] <PSI_Guy95> It's LEon B
[3:56:24] <%Sphincter_Spelunker> Leon B, yes
[3:56:25] <%ThePuddingDead> this hallway in A was GREAT
[3:56:27] <%SoleilAstier> leon B
[3:56:28] <%Laecerelius> you put a whole fucking clip of 9mm into a zombie and it still wasnt' enough
[3:56:29] <$Ernor_Woof> yeah, Leon B
[3:56:29] <+runegod20> damn that booty
[3:56:30] <MasterTonberry23> Oh cool, came to watch the VOD of last stream, find ol Patty's already live

[4:25:33] <SubjectX07x> I honestly haven't been watching... why is Leon holding it sideways?
[4:25:35] <%walternatorz> it looked like pat wanted to run for the suplex there
[4:25:36] <%konekoryugamine> SHIT
[4:25:36] <californaya> AW BEANS
[4:25:37] <ShmowzowKapow> sshit
[4:25:37] <%nofestu2> LEON CHAN
[4:25:38] <ebonifragaria> SHIET
[4:25:38] <ScreamingMeat> SHEEEYUT
[4:25:40] <KangarooCyborg> Like an inflatable punching clown
[4:25:40] <%DirtyGaijin> Remember the Yakuza have been through a zombie outbreak
[4:25:42] <Valdorick> Damn it Leon, remember the basics of ZRK (Zombie Roundhouse Kick)
[4:25:42] <%mostundesired> SHEEET
[4:25:44] <+Maids4lyfe> why can't Leon kick?
[4:25:47] <%lewdskeletor13> @subjectx07x Cause he’s a bad ass
[4:25:48] <%DirtyGaijin> CROSSOVER
[4:25:48] <The_Blumper> I wish real life had crosshairs
[4:25:51] <SchroedingersFerret> SICK CRITS
[4:25:52] <MasterTonberry23> Do you really need to kill anything? Its not like RE4 and 5 where they drop items
[4:25:53] <%konekoryugamine> Lickers
[4:25:54] <taptapmuhgap> Leon has not unlocked the kick ability
[4:25:55] <Desjardins75> kneecap them
[4:25:55] <SubjectX07x> @lewdskeletor13 Fair enough.
[4:25:56] <LiquidMathew> Mr X?
[4:25:56] <HowlJames> is there a mode to turn off the random cursing or an option?
[4:25:58] <%mostundesired> Leon should just suplex all these zombies
[4:26:00] <%marvinbrewton25> i hope they patch in less rounds to be used for head shots cause otherwise whats the point
[4:26:01] <Guardiansaiyan> @Valdorick needs more Las Plagas
[4:26:02] <%WackyGear> dogkiller
[4:26:02] <%konekoryugamine> Nope, just a lamp and a fan!
[4:26:02] <%king_wragles> @jobbedbone huh, I remember the selector being somewhere else for some reason
[4:26:03] <%lewdskeletor13> @maids4lyfe He hasn’t learned that skill yet
[4:26:06] <tmix1600> Cant just shoot his leg and walk past?
[4:26:06] <taptapmuhgap> you must first be assigned to the President to learn the Kick.
[4:26:06] <+StromkoPenguin> He hasn't grown comfortable enough with zombies to go Wrestlemania on them yet
[4:26:08] <%joylent_blue> Resident Evil: Dead Souls
[4:26:14] <haterbuns> He hasn't got permission to RHK yet
[4:26:16] <GohanEgret> @SubjectX07x it's a reference to what he could do in the PS1 version
[4:26:16] <%Zaxshimysham> negative puppers
[4:26:16] <+Dre_> Leon doesnt know how to kick yet guys
[4:26:16] <+Maids4lyfe> @lewdskeletor13 SeemsGood
[4:26:17] <+MyDarkStorm> Leaver
[4:26:18] <%Sphincter_Spelunker> who said that
[4:26:21] <+MyDarkStorm> Leave
[4:26:21] <privatesargent> @Maids4lyfe cause he is till a the rookie cop level, he needs to level up to government agent before he unlocks the kick
[4:26:22] <haisho> Firing Range zombies, you can ignore em
[4:26:22] <godzookylives> Leon doesn't have Secret Service training yet
[4:26:23] <SnaKemuho> 3rd dimension is pretty useful sometimes
[4:26:24] <%DirtyGaijin> Thats a no on the puppers
[4:26:28] <%DirtyGaijin> you killed them all
[4:26:34] <%MightyMaxT> WHO'S GROWLING?
[4:26:35] <pidleman> do all of Pat's streams get uploaded to youtube?
[4:26:37] <+Answer_Moose> Suddenly, X!
[4:26:39] <+Maids4lyfe> @privatesargent at this point I believe it
[4:26:40] <LiquidMathew> canon run?
[4:26:41] <taptapmuhgap> 6 years of training by the Govt. to learn how to kick properly lol
[4:26:43] <%xsnowfox> lickers?
[4:26:43] <%mostundesired> I'm sorry, the SECRET SERVICE taught Leon to SUPLEX ZOMBIES?
[4:26:44] <TheBlankAce> You used it on Birkin
[4:26:46] <%Blankets_and_Tea> crazy talk activate
[4:26:47] <%nofestu2> Majima in RE fucking kills me

[4:26:49] <Crankthulhu> @marvinbrewton25 I just wanna know how damage works. It feels like sometimes it takes 3 shots and sometimes it takes, like 5
[4:26:50] <GohanEgret> @pidleman yes
[4:26:51] <%AirlineFood74> Lickers, Birkin
[4:26:52] <%Shindeil> @AngriestPat In general, thanks for playing this. Am big babby.

[4:26:54] <Zaphire_Saucypants> yeah but Berkin.

[4:27:06] <%konekoryugamine> BITCHES LOVE CANONS
[4:27:07] <+AllenDeadman> you shot birken
[4:27:11] <breakerdsx> Deaths are filler arcs confirmed
[4:27:11] <+MyDarkStorm> Weird
[4:27:12] <+Kuro_Koshka> You shot Birkin
[4:27:12] <ScreamingMeat> REEEEEEEEE
[4:27:12] <+brickwall35> Pat would you eat Leon's ass?
[4:27:13] <%lewdskeletor13> @angriestpat why is Claire A canon?
[4:27:13] <alrobot2014> suplexing zombies is a valuable skill to be taught
[4:27:15] <%Engwithan_Elder_God> You're not as pretty as Claire
[4:27:16] <Zaphire_Saucypants> But Birkin tho
[4:27:17] <%Prism_Wing> Proton Canon!
[4:27:17] <%13ry4n93> mister x has adhd
[4:27:20] <+MyDarkStorm> Bye
[4:27:21] <%Reizie_Etherealm> I have a feeling you'll reset again in the future
[4:27:23] <%AirlineFood74> @Crankthulhu zombie health is inconsistent, if that's what you mean. They have a varied health pool
[4:27:23] <EmpressMoth> mr. X
[4:27:25] <%DirtyGaijin> MR X footsteps honestly had me panic when i was playing
[4:27:26] <%13ry4n93> and he didn't take his meds
[4:27:29] <pavlovs_idiot> you shot him in the arm does that even count
[4:27:29] <+runegod20> we beat like 90% of the RPD stuff to that point before we found him
[4:27:30] <NotBryson> FLocker
[4:27:33] <%konekoryugamine> SHIT
[4:27:33] <+MyDarkStorm> Oh HI
[4:27:41] <LiquidMathew> Looks like Dee

[4:27:56] <Guardiansaiyan> @joylent_blue agreed
[4:27:57] <%13ry4n93> @LiquidMathew Dee would be a zombie
[4:27:57] <KangarooCyborg> Go away Barbara Streisand!
[4:27:58] <+chaumiester> I wonder why they don't give you more upgrades for your Mk19 pistol, but they keep giving stuff for the Matilda
[4:28:02] <+Alig200> @Crankthulhu zombie health has generally been like that in every RE.
[4:28:03] <ebonifragaria> Looked like Anna from Deadly Premonition. Or rather, Anna looks like a zombie
[4:28:06] <%Secutus> Jeez, you really don't want to use the shotgun
[4:28:09] <%ThatGuyfromMars> @pidleman M19
[4:28:10] <DonatelloJose> That looked very spooky
[4:28:11] <%Hazard_Kujacker> @pidleman the M19 aka The Gangstanator
[4:28:12] <EmpressMoth> Time for some more Mr.X
[4:28:17] <%mostundesired> Pat seal of approval
[4:28:20] <%konekoryugamine> Then where's the Magnum?
[4:28:21] <%xsnowfox> leon tested, pat approved!
[4:28:25] <LiquidMathew> "The Gang visits Raccoon City"
[4:28:26] <KangarooCyborg> RE4 knife crouch
[4:28:26] <hntronium> KNOIFE
[4:28:26] <reonome> poor knife chan
[4:28:27] <+bubblebasspickles> that's a knoife
[4:28:27] <+Kuro_Koshka> SAVE
[4:28:29] <%hussdogrob> nut
[4:28:29] <%skizzuto> Knifu is lifu
[4:28:30] <%konekoryugamine> WHERE. Is. the. MAGNUM?
[4:28:30] <T_Sasquatch> issa KNIFE
[4:28:32] <Guardiansaiyan> @ebonifragaria Anna needed a job after the AFTERLIFE that paid...cops pay more than dinner waiters?
[4:28:32] <+Grayhammatter> knoife
[4:28:34] <%ThePuddingDead> use it to poke in a room with another
[4:28:34] <haisho> just dont forget about that Mr Raccoon in the bushes later

[4:28:36] <%Caidezes> SNAP
[4:28:37] <NotBryson> And this is a spoon
[4:28:39] <%ThatGuyfromMars> don't be mean to knife chan, she's been thru a lot
[4:28:39] <%Engwithan_Elder_God> Knife Chan actually on last day before retirement.
[4:28:43] <reonome> he already got the mugnum
[4:28:43] <%DirtyGaijin> Dee why are you a zombie, you stupid bitch!
[4:28:43] <ScreamingMeat> No it's not is's a fucking metal twig
[4:28:44] <alrobot2014> @konekoryugamine he has the magnum
[4:28:46] <%Nobrev> what are these knives made of? aluminum?
[4:28:49] <%AirlineFood74> @Crankthulhu not that I know of. I just figured it was that because of process of elimination. There's no way they would fuck with the gun for different zombinos, that just sounds like way too much effort
[4:28:49] <taptapmuhgap> Why does Leons handgun use .45's???????
[4:28:50] <MasterTonberry23> It feels so weird knowing you can lose your knife in a mainline RE game
[4:28:50] <%doc_ock_rokc> Headshots have a chance to crit and kill an enemy in one shot
[4:28:50] <EmpressMoth> Mr. RAccon cannot be gotten from the police station
[4:28:53] <+Alig200> @Crankthulhu I believe so, i think they do more base damage, and crit chance that allows you to explode the head.
[4:28:55] <%konekoryugamine> @alrobot2014 Oh, okay
[4:28:57] <+Grayhammatter> LUL
[4:28:57] <+MyDarkStorm> Nope

[4:29:08] <%AirlineFood74> @taptapmuhgap because he's using a 1911, not the Matilda
[4:29:08] <%konekoryugamine> Ah shit they kept this in
[4:29:10] <EmpressMoth> Hope no Mr. X

[5:16:22] <%megamonmon123> "easy mode is now accessable"
[5:16:22] <Geno4344> So they send in Mr. X and then they nuke the place? Seems like overkill

[5:17:07] <Fien111> @megamonmon123 That's not really fear, that's danger and a tedious one since you just have to run away instead of progressing.
[5:17:09] <%SpamKingRathalos> go stab him
[5:17:11] <Tonyzx15> thankfully X doesn't sprint at you
[5:17:12] <$Ernor_Woof> Almost time to give it BACK to X?

[5:17:43] <+ShinBojangles> Did somebody say CHOCOLATE?
[5:17:43] <+runegod20> if mr X wasn't around this whole section wouldn't really have any tension or difficulty
[5:17:43] <%templar010> Terrible
[5:17:47] <ScrubTheNerd> No I fell down there to have a shortcut away from X
[5:17:49] <%ThePuddingDead> Yoooooou
[5:17:49] <%ThatRandomGuy661> You mean BEST?
[5:17:50] <sarg1010> I feel like Mr X makes this game very unfun

[5:18:04] <%lewdskeletor13> @fien111 It’s a survival game dude. It’s supposed to stress you.
[5:18:05] <%Remery_> slippery Leon
[5:18:07] <%SpamKingRathalos> Mr.X really does make this section great
[5:18:07] <Osiris_Kazuhira> @jinking79 Max is actually good at video games.
[5:18:08] <ThespianBarrage> rooDab

[5:18:11] <thebakaliyen> Soulja boy paid a lot for his brand deal in this game
[5:18:12] <%jiin6> Mr X: you thought you were only one with the zapping system Mr Kennedy?
[5:18:13] <+Answer_Moose> save some time
[5:18:15] <RazHarvey> ass HOES
[5:18:17] <+G_Thunders> You don’t have to run away though. If you lose him and start walking calmly he can’t really find you. Then you just do the puzzles in peace
[5:18:17] <The_Blumper> do police stations usually have a library?
[5:18:19] <%Prism_Wing> V gonna come to it to ya.
[5:18:22] <%Engwithan_Elder_God> He used it last night when you were Claire.

[5:18:30] <+MyDarkStorm> Max Is up
[5:18:30] <taptapmuhgap> B gon bring it with yuh!

[5:18:34] <%rumtumtugnutz> RPD station used to be a Museum
[5:18:38] <Valdorick> Some do, though they're more records rooms.

[5:18:50] <+ahdurian> can X even follow you in this part? i dont remember
[5:18:51] <+TheWallOfMeat> G gon gamble it on ya
[5:18:52] <Fien111> @lewdskeletor13 That's my issue. It doesn't seem like stress, it seems like annoyance. "Oh, X is here, guess I gotta do a loop to lose him before I can finish this puzzle"
[5:18:54] <+sickatriz> D gunna di... nvm
[5:18:55] <pidleman> yeah, a flashlight in a horror game for once not having a stupid battery limitation
[5:18:56] <DesuDesuDokiDoki> s m o l
[5:18:56] <zunath> I'm on the final boss on hardcore and I'm totally out of healing lmfao. I probably have to redo the run
[5:18:56] <majindusto> THE IDEA OF REmake NEMESIS TERRIFIES ME!
[5:18:57] <haterbuns> METAL GEAR?
[5:18:58] <%JJCheeker> I still have to watch the rest of his stream last night
[5:18:59] <taptapmuhgap> F gon freak it on yuh!!
[5:19:01] <Geno4344> Can Kazuma Kiryu beat Mr. X?
[5:19:01] <Marpolo13> @The_Blumper police stations normally aren't former museums
[5:19:02] <%snow_bush> Welp, I'm crashing, time for slep
[5:19:03] <+Grayhammatter> METAL GEAR
[5:19:04] <%rumtumtugnutz> That's why it has a weird clock tower and a giant murder basement
[5:19:06] <SchroedingersFerret> smol
[5:19:08] <majinpickles> Patirishamerican
[5:19:08] <%sirmackslot> I'm just terrified to think of Nemesis in a RE3 remake

[5:19:13] <em0t10nalr3ck> Smol Metal Gear
[5:19:13] <+paladinstarbuster> HE COMIN
[5:19:14] <RazHarvey> small gear, a weapon to suprass metal gear
[5:19:16] <%OwlLightningMage> Kiryu could defeat Shaggy himself
[5:19:21] <RazHarvey> surpass even
[5:19:23] <%SpamKingRathalos> LIES
[5:19:25] <%Sphincter_Spelunker> Someone made a good point earlier. Shouldn't it be RCPD not Raccoon Police Department?
[5:19:26] <%ThePuddingDead> i can hear its stomping in my DREAMS
[5:19:26] <+SpaghettiPuncher> I'm at this part and have like no ammo
[5:19:28] <jinking79> it just the item being at different locations in that mode got me
[5:19:29] <Guardiansaiyan> Nostalgia?
[5:19:29] <DarkKnightGrave> OH LAWD

[5:19:37] <+honorable_captain_garlock> you just said you liked it
[5:19:42] <+runegod20> just holster your gun and carry it manually
[5:19:43] <TeethandHunger> Why dose pat think he’s safe?
[5:19:44] <Silly_Duckling> It happens in most horror games; once you understand how the monster works, it's just annoying. That isn't special here.
[5:19:45] <%rumtumtugnutz> They already made a Zombie game with Kiryu. It was trash.
[5:19:46] <%lewdskeletor13> @fien111 You can lose him. It’s skill based. Sorry you want the game to be easier, maybe play something else
[5:19:47] <+Answer_Moose> Are you gonna play KH3 pat?
[5:19:48] <DotDusk> It is a big gear for big bois
[5:19:51] <+runegod20> not like you can hold it in your pouches
[5:19:51] <Funcokler_Xerow> it takes up one whole hip pouch
[5:19:51] <%Laecerelius> Why does a handgun with a stock or a magnum with a longer barrel take as much space as a minigun?
[5:19:51] <taptapmuhgap> R gon read it to yuh!
[5:19:52] <ebonifragaria> Enlarge your ass to increase your storage space
[5:19:52] <AcidHybrid> It be like that sometimes

Unfortunately, he taught his apprentice everything he knew, then his apprentice killed him in his sleep. Ironic. He could save others from death, but not himself.

[5:40:15] <ebonifragaria> @PeachSaliva Damn I didn't even think of that
[5:40:16] <+SoriduSnaku> maybe he lined up the shot to kill both of them
[5:40:16] <%king_wragles> Like, Leon knows the world is ending.... right?

[5:47:34] <kingdudeby> Alligators have no strength when they open their mouths. Leon could have just held the gators mouth closed. This was animal cruelty.
[5:47:34] <taptapmuhgap> I wonder what happens if you don't shoot it
[5:47:35] <Overhaul180> Reload like a cool guy

[5:48:44] <zombric> Good question
[5:48:44] <%Typhaeon> I can't tell if I love or hate Leon's goofy, overly sincere voice actor
[5:48:47] <%jiin6> Ada: sanitation
[5:48:51] <%13ry4n93> no actually I think the gator is more dangerous

[5:48:59] <AcidHybrid> Isn't William way more dangerous? lmao
[5:48:59] <%OwlLightningMage> She's a bad parent. The worst monster of all LUL
[5:49:01] <Funcokler_Xerow> I dunno, Annette's probably not gonna eat you
[5:49:02] <+Grayhammatter> LUL
[5:49:02] <Valdorick> I think on a scale of 2 to 4, Birkin is 3spoopy5me
[5:49:03] <%RageKingDomo> is that a fucking stock lmfao
[5:49:04] <wolf_hurricane> the true question: Have Ada step on you or fuck Ashley's armpit? B)
[5:49:04] <HowlJames> Annete doesn't fucking one shot you
[5:49:04] <%13ry4n93> like conceptually anette could be more dangerous but
[5:49:05] <%ThePuddingDead> you too?
[5:49:05] <waifoong98> They sells them to US Loen, for VIYDAGAMEz Kappa
[5:49:06] <%cureneckbeard> Why would you sell the virus when you could keep the virus and have a monopoly on the monsters
[5:49:07] <+Answer_Moose> Those are glue tubs!
[5:49:07] <+ArcLifth> me too
[5:49:07] <%RaikenTB> You're weird, Pat.
[5:49:07] <FatherGreyBeard> agreed
[5:49:07] <%MightyMaxT> How old is Leon here? 22? 23?
[5:49:09] <Kaitepaints> That was just an alligator??
[5:49:09] <kingdudeby> They sell the virus's, but Umbrella is the only one who ever releases them.
[5:49:10] <@Moobot> Whoa I don't even shout that much! (@Zaphire_Saucypants)
[5:49:12] <%RageKingDomo> on the pistol??

[5:49:23] <TwistedVerse> leon is actually 10 in this game
[5:49:27] <%Corporate_Redeemer> What if DIO had the T-Virus?
[5:49:29] <%SpamKingRathalos> SHOOT
[5:49:31] <Kaitepaints> Pat how old is Leon?

[5:49:52] <%rdark_ksu> she has death hair
[5:49:55] <em0t10nalr3ck> Leon is actually 2 years old in this game
[5:49:57] <%willjar313> Using viruses as weapons strikes me as a TERRIBLE fucking idea strategically, due to the facts that you can't control who it spreads to and that viruses are prone to mutation.
[5:49:57] <+Grayhammatter> ADA !

[6:10:48] <Longfang91> @cumurasame oof
[6:10:50] <jackktrue> Where did he come from?
[6:10:51] <%OwlLightningMage> Anthem has the benefit of not being Fallout 76 and that's pretty much it
[6:10:52] <generalhayes> HEY
[6:10:54] <%ThatGuyfromMars> I just want the Mass Effect trilogy on the switch, then Bioware can disappear into the pages of history
[6:10:55] <%Fenrirlives> @max_radical is the demo for PC or console?
[6:11:01] <UMPUM> Use your big gamer brain
[6:11:02] <generalhayes> KEY
[6:11:02] <TyrantBelial> At this point, Mr. X should be dead.
[6:11:04] <haterbuns> Yeah, Fett doesn't do shit. HUNK is a legit survivor
[6:11:06] <FatherGreyBeard> don't you have the valve?
[6:11:09] <%13ry4n93> @cumurasame I don't know what you're talking about Boba got his man and was responsible for pretty much the entire third act

[6:16:03] <Longfang91> Friends
[6:16:04] <+StromkoPenguin> Yeah I think the actual VP70 is supposed to burst fire so quickly you don't feel the recoil until it's done. But videogames usually have slower guns.
[6:16:04] <%JenovasPuppet> @AngriestPat Can we get the big gross eye as an emote as well as a badge?

[6:22:13] <+BorinCorran> That is a manly shotgun right there. You really need the stock.
[6:22:20] <%Reizie_Etherealm> Too bad it's not polymer, but I can't expect everything to be tactical in 1998
[6:22:21] <Longfang91> Yes. Saw off the barrel, Leon
[6:22:24] <reonome> how the fuck does claire know leon is down here
[6:22:24] <$Mighty_observer> so big and black

[6:22:28] <Firesparks> next we need a bayonet
[6:22:31] <Alexisonfires> @willjar313 actually the t-virus was completely destroyed when raccoon city was nuked, it's just that umbrella had other viruses already made in their other facilities across the world aka Code Veronica and the Las Plagas and so on forth
[6:22:33] <$Mighty_observer> the gun I mean
[6:22:33] <+runegod20> so claire just didn't pick up any of the items, do any of the puzzles, kill any zombies, and somehow made it through
[6:22:40] <+CrystalTree07> Red Herb
[6:22:40] <jackktrue> you can go in the train car i believe

[6:22:51] <Shwepie> Are we going to end with Claire crushing all over Leon only to get rejected just like Ashley did?
[6:22:51] <%yoshkosh20> so that's how they communicate. through sticky notes.
[6:22:51] <+Over_ninek> it's the way Marvin taught him
[6:22:51] <%MrBorisMakarov> qneGun

[6:23:29] <@Moobot> I've been playing this game for how long? Oh only 6h 23m.
[6:23:30] <%ThatGuyfromMars> @Shwepie Leon was twice ashley's age tho
[6:23:31] <waifoong98> @Mighty_observer LUL
[6:23:34] <%SuperiorDelta> @ThatGuyfromMars Was all fun and games until the final bit were you either save or kill Leon and the AI went from getting 3 tapped by other AI but against us they took all 3 of our ammo and one friend was keeping them knocked down in a corner with a shotgun
[6:23:39] <+Doctor_Stew> So this one plays like RE4 now?
[6:23:40] <%Rayorin> the thing about guns not being right in games, is that them being correct to reality wouldn't usually change anything in game. it would just be more accurate.
[6:23:41] <%Cogito1001> That gangsta aim
[6:23:44] <+goldenwerewolf> I love this blap blap gangsta aiming Leon's doing
[6:23:44] <%OwlLightningMage> @lewdskeletor13 Sans Undertale
[6:23:45] <OldOnyx> Isn't the sideways aim just with the gun he used to have with the gang costume in the original game?
[6:23:48] <PSI_Guy95> consensus seems to be an erb, thanks guys
[6:23:51] <taptapmuhgap> @AngriestPat The story the environment is telling rules. Them beer bottles on the stairs says someone aint doing they job l ol

[6:24:15] <kiryuuva> @AngriestPat boop.
[6:24:17] <%Reizie_Etherealm> There's one tiny detail I noticed just now, you notice how the M19's recoil goes sideways instead of upwards? That's because he's holding it slanted at an angle
[6:24:22] <%koreanbae> his shotgun is all wet

[6:26:37] <%SergeantSov> Did I miss X for this run? I was...distracted.
[6:26:37] <%Skeletorexplains> Never!
[6:26:41] <%ThatGuyfromMars> DO IT
[6:26:43] <%yoshkosh20> whoever shat that out should get their colon examined

[6:26:48] <+brickwall35> @MaeMae94 ty
[6:26:53] <%ThatGuyfromMars> NOTHING IS IMPOSSIBLE
[6:26:53] <%Reizie_Etherealm> I'm not sure if you people know but holding your gun at a 30-45 degree angle helps make the recoil more controllable
[6:26:58] <%OwlLightningMage> There can only be one skeletoro
[6:26:59] <loveplusearth> am i getting spoiled rn?
[6:27:01] <Shwepie> Need more hip pouches, so many more.
[6:27:06] <FatherGreyBeard> get rook right?
[6:27:11] <reonome> GET ROOK
[6:27:13] <+runegod20> the 1911 is the only gun that hasn't been upgraded yet so it's probably that?
[6:27:17] <%ThatGuyfromMars> @loveplusearth I mean, you're getting spoiled on a remake of a 20+ year old game
[6:27:34] <Zzross_the_savagezz> @ThatGuyfromMars Thank you Shia
[6:27:34] <%Laecerelius> Could be an extended mag for the magnum?
[6:27:36] <%FLAMINGBABYPUNCH> doodLoen Can't beat me
[6:27:41] <%Rafferty3231> so who's that huge lumbering dude in the jacket who shows up on occasion?
[6:27:41] <%ThatGuyfromMars> @Zzross_the_savagezz <3
[6:27:44] <+Ilpala271> no jam that handle into the keyhole
[6:27:44] <$Mighty_observer> holding your gun sideways decreases aim by 50% but increases damage by 1000%
[6:27:44] <FatherGreyBeard> will 1911 get upgrade?
[6:27:48] <%ThatGuyfromMars> @Rafferty3231 Mr. X
[6:27:50] <+Alig200> 1911 doesnt get any upgrades.
[6:27:51] <actualemu> wait why is leon shooting that gun sideways like a GANGSTERRRR
[6:27:51] <Longfang91> I think the Mag gets a long barrel
[6:27:56] <%Rafferty3231> gotcha
[6:27:56] <+runegod20> probably an extended 1911 mag
[6:27:57] <TwistedVerse> the gangsta way
[6:28:02] <loveplusearth> yeah, i suppose thanks, and by the time i play it meself i wont even remember where he is
[6:28:03] <bwZel> @AngriestPat Can you accidentally discard a key item?
[6:28:03] <+runegod20> the mag already has the barrel
[6:28:04] <TheOneUpWarrior> goood mr. x has been so stressful!
[6:28:09] <%Laecerelius> Already got the magnum long barrel
[6:28:11] <+Alig200> Magnum gets a red dot sight

[6:28:17] <%willjar313> I am legitimately AMAZED at how much effort Capcom put into this game.
[6:28:19] <%13ry4n93> @FatherGreyBeard the 1911 got it's first upgrade at around 1917
[6:28:19] <%ThatGuyfromMars> @actualemu It's an easter egg to the OG RE2
[6:28:20] <+Grayhammatter> cause leon is a gangstar
[6:28:29] <%Sphincter_Spelunker> These Evil Within headshots are nerve wracking

[6:28:46] <chaospudding> I managed to kill two zombies outside a safe room in two headshots and an exploded head, but then I had to reload and they never died as quickly again :(
[6:28:47] <Shwepie> @Mighty_observer Over a large sample size that effectively doubles your damage. Why would you never hold your gun sideways?
[6:28:49] <MaeMae94> WAT?!?!?! I didn't even find that on my playthrough PogChamp
[6:28:52] <zaptar13> @sergeantsov He shows up some more later on

[6:29:53] <CaptainMadSkull> @yoshkosh20 thats not it if your talking about the 1911 its an easter egg to a costume in the classic game

[6:31:55] <taptapmuhgap> @AngriestPat Here is a fun thing I noticed from watching the demo. Whenever you meet the cop at the shutter door whoever tries to save him uses the BAREST MINIMUM effort to do so and as a result the cop dies. So they basically just let him die yo.

[6:34:40] <+MrWrann> That's a lot of drugs
[6:34:41] <einSynd> But maybe Leon say funny thing
[6:34:42] <+ginger__gaming__> what if it's different?
[6:34:44] <SirSmudgey> what if its different this time
[6:34:44] <taptapmuhgap> @AngriestPat so after watching the demo when leon meets Shutter Cop he puts forth the barest minimum effort and in essence just lets the cop die. instead of grabbing him by the vest and dragging him to safety he grabs his hand and flips him overto let his pepis get et.
[6:34:44] <+ginger__gaming__> Side B Pat
[6:34:45] <%OwlLightningMage> Open the locker though Pat 4Head
[6:34:48] <$Mighty_observer> yall some future prison dwellers
[6:34:48] <Longfang91> snipeaFine snipeaFine snipeaFine snipeaFine snipeaFine snipeaFine
[6:34:48] <%Cogito1001> GIMME FUEL GIMMIE FIRE GIMME THAT WHICH I Desire UGH
[6:34:50] <+runegod20> you can down them with a shotgun and probably kill them with like a tiny bit of flame
[6:34:51] <%JonWhoLovesFlatWomen> apatJpeg
[6:34:54] <DesuDesuDokiDoki> INCOMPLETE RUN
[6:34:55] <%Fenrirlives> But What if Leon says a funny?
[6:34:55] <EmpressMoth> Can we revisit the parking lot? I wanna know if the swat car is destroyed. @AngriestPat
[6:34:56] <TeethandHunger> You guys know that Ada is just an Asian version of Paige. Both great at their spy jobs. Leon and Ada relationship would be just like Paige and Pat’s except with more dead bodies.
[6:34:58] <SaltyJedi> Did you open the locker Pat?
[6:35:06] <Silly_Duckling> glad the locker isn't locked with a wire puzzle Kappa
[6:35:06] <+ginger__gaming__> THE locker!
[6:35:06] <%forebringer> apatCanada
[6:35:08] <RazHarvey> yea, what if leon says something
[6:35:10] <%SiameseSneeze> Dude, that cop would have shot him or had his badge
[6:35:10] <TwistedVerse> looks like pat's been taking his GAMER FUEL tm
[6:35:11] <DarkKnightGrave> Need my Tomboy in Boy Shorts fix.
[6:35:12] <Zaphire_Saucypants> yeah Pat, did you get the locker?
[6:35:14] <mr_slaide> GUNS
[6:35:15] <%ThePuddingDead> too bad
[6:35:21] <Longfang91> Yeah, I get that
[6:35:23] <majindusto> He Didn't open the Locker
[6:35:23] <$ooblagis> I agree, that seems like a weird choice
[6:35:24] <%ThePuddingDead> you've been doin fine
[6:35:25] <em0t10nalr3ck> Sherry grows up to have thunderthighs and becomes a secret agent like her dad, Leon
[6:35:26] <%Laecerelius> combine more regular gunpowder then
[6:35:26] <Zaphire_Saucypants> the glooorious Locker that you always miss?
[6:35:30] <jman13131313> swat car ???
[6:35:35] <lizard0tm> How does it overly complicate?
[6:35:43] <generalhayes> flamethrower is not as use full as intended
[6:35:45] <+BorinCorran> It seems better than Claire B's fucking cowboy revolver. That thing is a nightmare.
[6:35:45] <%Rayorin> @teethandhunger less dead bodies you mean
[6:35:49] <$Mighty_observer> oh my God that new MTN dew energy drink... lord
[6:35:49] <%Laecerelius> you're gonna use all the good gunpowder for your badass LIGHTNINGHAWK!
[6:35:50] <HanPaul> is RE6 worth it to experience legal Sherry 🤔
[6:35:51] <+MrWrann> What's the population of Raccoon City pre zombies
[6:35:53] <%JJCheeker> What did he say
[6:35:58] <+Alig200> @AngriestPat it would've been okay if the matila/sl60 parts were replaced with m19/saa parts, but they're not, so its like eh.
[6:36:03] <Longfang91> Wonder if there's a chance of a mod that just takes out the 1911 or makes Leon hold ia properly if you prefer
[6:36:08] <%Sphincter_Spelunker> None of the cut monsters from original RE2 made it into the remake FeelsBadMan
[6:36:10] <Scharfster> Where Mr X at?
[6:36:11] <HanPaul> Did RedBull send you those cases @AngriestPat
[6:36:12] <TeethandHunger> Do I?
[6:36:15] <%OwlLightningMage> They should remake Re6 LUL
[6:36:17] <%Laecerelius> I wanna call it the Laserhawk now
[6:36:18] <+Rolandknight> @AngriestPat so was there more then one MR. X in this game. since we saw one get owen in Claire game.
[6:36:22] <em0t10nalr3ck> @HanPaul It's worth it for the Sherry mods
[6:36:23] <Guardiansaiyan> @Scharfster getting more jobs
[6:36:26] <%ThatGuyfromMars> It's so weird to think that Leon would be in his 40s now
[6:36:29] <%cervidaequus> @HanPaul still in the mail
[6:36:31] <TwistedVerse> LUL so does this mean youre now a full-time RE2make speedrunner, pat? LUL @AngriestPat
[6:36:32] <TeethandHunger> I probably do
[6:36:38] <generalhayes> kill the big gross
[6:36:39] <Scharfster> @Guardiansaiyan i wish him luck :0
[6:36:48] <+BorinCorran> @OwlLightningMage Yes, give me Zombie Dinosaur final boss.
[6:36:51] <%coffeeabomination> @angriestpat Will you be doing any of the MHW anniversary on stream?
[6:36:52] <loveplusearth> re6 is worth getting just to see for yourself, its cheap as hell right now anyway. its not the worst game in the universe
[6:36:55] <PSI_Guy95> wot if... TWO Mr. X chasing you down at once
[6:37:08] <+SagatAteMyCornFlakes> Yoouu bastard
[6:37:09] <allanmiri> [pop
[6:37:12] <generalhayes> ohhhhhhhhhh
[6:37:12] <taptapmuhgap> @AngriestPat So if you watch closely, Leon or Claire LETS shutter cop die by using the barest effort to try and pull him through. rather than grabbing his vest and pulling with all they strength they let his pepis get et off.
[6:37:13] <Longfang91> @psi_guy95 Doesn't that happen in one of the CGI movies?
[6:37:13] <%ThatGuyfromMars> RE6 is good for Leon's campaign but that's about it
[6:37:15] <+MaikuKnight> How can the zombies breath underwater?
[6:37:16] <+SenorCounter> I always wondered, did the people in Racoon city really come down to the sewers for shelter or something?
[6:37:17] <LegendaryDorkKnight> re6 is fun just dont think about it too hard
[6:37:19] <ScreamingMeat> squeaky
[6:37:22] <majindusto> They should have brought back the MAN-SPIDERS!!!
[6:37:24] <FatherGreyBeard> RE6 Mercenaries is decent imo
[6:37:25] <MissMalisin> monkaS
[6:37:29] <+Grayhammatter> monkaS
[6:37:32] <$Mighty_observer> @peachsaliva @angriestpat ok dweebs I'm still at work so... I gotta go. catch you on the flipside
[6:37:33] <TikanZK> monkaS
[6:37:33] <PSI_Guy95> Pat with the RE knowledge
[6:37:34] <%Cogito1001> @Rolandknight Leons segment of the game is happening around the time claires is, this is happening before X gets fucked
[6:37:34] <KangarooCyborg> They turn you into a Chinese finger trap
[6:37:37] <Enthaarungscreme> So it's canon
[6:37:38] <reonome> @taptapmuhgap okay we get it jeez
[6:37:39] <%nofestu2> sigh
[6:37:43] <%ThatGuyfromMars> Mercenaries is fun but once Raid Mode happened I can't go back
[6:37:44] <%Laecerelius> You can do it!
[6:37:45] <+BorinCorran> @ThatGuyfromMars I thought Ada's wasn't bad either. Chris is the only one that was bad imo.
[6:37:47] <%nekourabe> The canon game
[6:37:47] <Firestreakie> What time is it there?
[6:37:50] <HanPaul> Pat needs his fix monkaS
[6:37:51] <%Laecerelius> Some of us believe in you!
[6:37:52] <taptapmuhgap> all done :D
[6:37:57] <+oOZtkOo> @AngriestPat The Greatest Jagras spits out a few dozen decos

[6:38:17] <TwistedVerse> ew
[6:38:17] <%ThatGuyfromMars> @BorinCorran Chris' campaign was the worst. It was so out of character

[7:43:15] <+TheImmortal70> Zaap
[7:43:20] <%PaladinDupre> @Sphincter_Spelunker sounds delicious. I've had salami on pizza and thats good too, so is prosciutto
[7:43:20] <%willjar313> You got ZAPPED, Pat!
[7:43:21] <%around_40_jobbers> Its in T H E L O C K E R
[7:43:22] <%doc_ock_rokc> I thought Trunks was a princess
[7:43:25] <DesuDesuDokiDoki> YEYEYE
[7:43:30] <stevenschmee> I just beat my hardcore second run, and after doing 4th survivor, I've come to the conclusion that 4th survivor doesn't work with the new style of escaping. The Ivy instant kills ruin a whole run.
[7:43:33] <Manjove> OPEN THE LOCKER
[7:43:35] <AthenOwl> check the back of the CD case
[7:43:36] <GalaxyGirlChel> I'm gonna go out on a limb and say...I have no idea
[7:43:39] <Valdorick> The locker!?
[7:43:41] <Coystick> Avoid the locker
[7:43:43] <waifoong98> Don't worry, half of those will be gone in HARDCORE LUL
[7:43:46] <Coystick> AVOID THE LOCKER
[7:43:47] <+TheWallOfMeat> @PaladinDupre prosciutto on pizza sounds like the most decadent shit and I love it
[7:43:54] <+lessclams> gotta save grenades for the ivy guys
[7:43:54] <%Sphincter_Spelunker> Pastrami, Mozzarella, Pickles and Mustard drizzle. I'm a big coward because pastrami is very hit or miss locally.
[7:43:59] <%willjar313> @doc_ock_rokc In accordance to King Vegeta's first decree, you shall only refer to her as Princess Trunks.
[7:44:00] <+TheImmortal70> Honestly the only thing Hardcore seems to do is give you a reasonable amount of ammo
[7:44:04] <DesuDesuDokiDoki> L O C K E R
[7:44:04] <Zaphire_Saucypants> The locker, Pat, the locker!
[7:44:04] <DraxTD> get the knife get the knife get the knife
[7:44:06] <+ginger__gaming__> The Real Locker was inside us all along
[7:44:11] <+TheImmortal70> The REAL kicker to hardcore is that some of the inventory upgrades are just GONE
[7:44:15] <%AllyBeeBoo> what time is it where pat is?
[7:44:15] <Run44forrest> fancy smancy pizza
[7:44:21] <Sielas> @AngriestPat has any jumpscare spooked you hard so far?
[7:44:21] <$crown_clown22> 5831 pat
[7:44:22] <+TheImmortal70> You don't get free upgrades for just arriving
[7:44:22] <waifoong98> @TheImmortal70 and limited saves to fuck with Pat OCD LUL
[7:44:23] <grayjammer> @TheWallOfMeat It's more like indestructible straps of leather glued to your pizza making it more of a hassle.
[7:44:27] <Coystick> Locker? I barely know her! Hiyooooo
[7:44:28] <Plaidstone> If Hardcore has a reasonable amount of ammo, I'm not sure I can ever play Hardcore
[7:44:34] <Zaphire_Saucypants> We must respect the LOCKER!
[7:44:42] <$birdfella> GANGGANG
[7:44:46] <stevenschmee> Ivy are poorly designed. Inescapable command grabs that insta kill.
[7:44:46] <Valdorick> IMMO, just hit this shit with a flamethrow
[7:44:48] <+TheImmortal70> Why are you using the tiny pistol when you can FLAME
[7:44:51] <Plaidstone> I'm running out of ammo constantly in non-hardcore in the police station
[7:44:52] <+TheWallOfMeat> Guess Pat's afraid of a challenge, eh?
[7:44:54] <imMab> the perfect mode would be standard with limited saves
[7:44:54] <AlasterAngelo> is it spelled Licker or Liquor
[7:44:58] <dan_g_v> Why is Leon shooting Gangsta Style?
[7:45:00] <+TheImmortal70> Licker
[7:45:01] <+ginger__gaming__> The zombie was drunk!
[7:45:01] <%SergeantSov> He died drunk.
[7:45:03] <Coystick> Pat is afraid of the locker
[7:45:04] <waifoong98> Main, they sure are BRAINNNN DEADDd
[7:45:07] <%PaladinDupre> @TheWallOfMeat local make your own mini pizza place had it as a special for a while. Mixed Marinara and pesto sauce, fresh mozz, onions, sauteed mushrooms, and posciutto under the cheese.

[7:51:27] <AlasterAngelo> @Dath123 lame
[7:51:32] <stevenschmee> RE zombies aren't regular zombies though. The virus makes them super durable, hence why it's a great bio weapon. Drop it into a country and there's no stopping the zombies
[7:51:36] <Valdorick> Hoarding is just the item collection version of getting HUGE.
[7:51:42] <%willjar313> @grayjammer To be fair, there aren't very many games that can do flamethrowers right.
[7:51:42] <DesuDesuDokiDoki> u sure?
[7:51:44] <reonome> thats what they want you to think pat
[7:51:44] <CurrySauseBandit> @EmpressMoth He has a shiiiitton of flamethrower ammo in stroage
[7:51:45] <%Laecerelius> Wasting all of that precious magnum powder on crappy shotgun shells...
[7:51:48] <Zaphire_Saucypants> @AngriestPat which do you prefer in this game, the shotgun or the flamethrower?
[7:51:51] <+Nomicro4u> Hoarding more like Hugeing
[7:51:55] <LegendaryDorkKnight> attache caseHD?
[7:51:55] <EmpressMoth> THat is why he should carry more
[7:51:59] <%willjar313> HUUUUGE!
[7:52:01] <Run44forrest> yeah but whats the point in whiping oout an entire country
[7:52:04] <+TheWallOfMeat> @stevenschmee I wouldn't call it a "great" bioweapon, since it's equally hard to keep the zombies in the place you want to hit

[7:52:53] <+TheWallOfMeat> @runegod20 yes, that's why bioweapons aren't generally a good idea
[7:52:53] <dan_g_v> Plagas Super weak to light, so only at night
[7:52:53] <LiquidMathew> But wasn't the point to make Tyrants? zombies was a accident
[7:52:56] <AlasterAngelo> Las Plagas lets you keep the population somewhat the same besides the exploding heads
[7:52:57] <GalaxyGirlChel> he wants to become a heckin chonker
[7:52:58] <falseeyed> !uptime
[7:52:58] <Run44forrest> remember when the virus got in the ocean
[7:52:58] <+TotesSleepyBear> So good luck taking that city you wanted.
[7:52:59] <%around_40_jobbers> Wesker wanted oroboros to ruin the planet tho so...
[7:53:02] <+AtlasMcCoy> It's basically a nuke but worse because it's pretty easy to accidentally nuke yourself
[7:53:03] <DesuDesuDokiDoki> almost 8 hours
[7:53:06] <AthenOwl> @AngriestPat yo RE Survivor when?
[7:53:07] <%Fenrirlives> So how are Las Plagas and Uroboros supposed to be better?
[7:53:09] <+runegod20> the T virus infects everything, not just humans
[7:53:09] <T_Sasquatch> Where are we going ?? Kappa
[7:53:12] <+TotesSleepyBear> The G-virus would be a great way to take over a city.
[7:53:12] <EmpressMoth> I know he is but I want to see more flamethrower action without stopping @CurrySauseBandit
[7:53:16] <%Laecerelius> Yeah, bio warefare is pretty fuckign dumb unless you really want to annihilate an area and not take it over
[7:53:20] <Valdorick> Wesker just wanted complete global saturation.
[7:53:22] <%SergeantSov> Or like, nuking a place. You can't inhabit it again safely for a couple decades
[7:53:22] <+runegod20> sure they might die out over time but even than
[7:53:29] <%Sphincter_Spelunker> Urubores was supposed to be forced evolution
[7:53:29] <Run44forrest> what was resi revelations virus?
[7:53:30] <DrDomVonDoom> The original original point was to create a cure to death, this was all a byproductr
[7:53:32] <stevenschmee> So RE4make next? Kappa
[7:53:33] <%Sphincter_Spelunker> Uro*
[7:53:35] <+TotesSleepyBear> Just send in a G-virus monster and you'll take over a city easily.
[7:53:39] <MrDonTacos_> yay
[7:53:43] <%doc_ock_rokc> Uroboros was just las plagas with T virus and G virus mixed in
[7:53:46] <lloyddboy> THIS PUZZLE AGAIN
[7:53:46] <FatherGreyBeard> I don't see the light weakness as too much of a problem as most of the time to even expose the plaga you have to blow up the infected's head
[7:53:48] <+Nohamforsam> you... did it
[7:53:49] <%willjar313> Say ya wanna invade France, so ya drop the T-Virus on Paris and a bunch of other French cities. Congrats, the French are all dead. Now ya gotta send dudes in to kill the things that killed the French.
[7:53:49] <%Nobrev> maybe you can disperse something to neutralize it over the area? I dunno umbrella does idiot science
[7:53:50] <+runegod20> but i guess giving everyone in a country hyper aids would kind of have the same effect since they probably won't transmit it when dead
[7:53:56] <LegendaryDorkKnight> nemesis remake next
[7:53:57] <AlasterAngelo> Uroboros was a giant failure
[7:53:58] <FatherGreyBeard> so it's more like they're soldiers that are tougher in the dark
[7:54:01] <cumurasame> I'm more concerned about why Umbrella after succesfully being able to command hunters decided to experiment with more unstable animals which lack intellect and pack mentality
[7:54:02] <DesuDesuDokiDoki> pat really likes it
[7:54:03] <Manjove> Oroboros was just everything in one
[7:54:04] <waifoong98> Uroboros is DMC2 invading RE5 Kappa
[7:54:05] <dan_g_v> The Veronica Virus was "better" because it was resistant to fire, the weakness of the original virus
[7:54:07] <%around_40_jobbers> Ora-Oros

[7:54:29] <CurrySauseBandit> @EmpressMoth Fair enough. Should be plenty for what's left though. Guess we'll see.
[7:54:30] <+TheWallOfMeat> @runegod20 issue is keeping it inside the country at all. People are probably going to try and flee the hyperaids, and will take it with them
[7:54:31] <DracaenaLeaf> This again lmao

[7:55:26] <%willjar313> @Valdorick Thing is, you'd likely need a nuke to take care of the monsters made by the T-Virus. Could just use the nuke from that start and cut out the middle man. Either way, it's a war crime.

[7:56:35] <+runegod20> zombies would still be easier to kill than people by virtual of not being able to use weapons or move that well
[7:56:37] <+StromkoPenguin> You probably dump T-Virus way behind enemy lines or before a war starts to just sow massive chaos.
[7:56:39] <+TotesSleepyBear> Next time, freeze the key.
[7:56:39] <%All_Salt> Is this game called Biohazard 2 in the UK?
[7:56:40] <Archer336> Or Claire reset everything just to spite Leon
[7:56:40] <%Gorgen> pretty COOL
[7:56:40] <%around_40_jobbers> If you take Uroboros and Cabal Coffers you get a lot of mana
[7:56:41] <%willjar313> @TheWallOfMeat True, but that doesn't you're trying for War Crime Bingo either.
[7:56:44] <+TheImmortal70> @dracaenaleaf You think people aren't going to play these more than once? LUL
[7:56:47] <RazHarvey> this game is basically the movie clue, there ya go
[7:56:47] <ScreamingMeat> Organic Hex
[7:56:51] <thebakaliyen> I have a feeling... Pat was supposed to play Leon on New Game
[7:56:52] <%willjar313> *doesn't mean
[7:56:55] <cumurasame> I want Pat to play darkside chronociles
[7:56:55] <Run44forrest> wait so what was tricell
[7:56:57] <RazHarvey> "heres what really happened"
[7:56:59] <jcmonkey> the lab is way more better in my opionion
[7:57:00] <+TheImmortal70> Plant 43's entire existence is to get fucked by people multiple times
[7:57:03] <+TheWallOfMeat> @willjar313 now I want to see what war crime bingo cards look like
[7:57:07] <%doc_ock_rokc> @RazHarvey Stop making sense
[7:57:08] <+BorinCorran> @Sphincter_Spelunker I actually could see that happening. Who the hell wants to own stock in a company like Umbrella?
[7:57:10] <%nofestu2> THATS RAD
[7:57:12] <Valdorick> I mean, I guess if Umbrella didn't have insane people working on just straight up killing humanity, or clinging so hard to their research that they inject the virus right into their dicks, then they could in theory create an anti-virus that would kill all the zombies while not harming the humans.
[7:57:16] <dan_g_v> Darkside Chronicles still the more solid canon for RE2, yeap
[7:57:19] <stevenschmee> Darkside Chronicles remake when? Kappa
[7:57:29] <RazHarvey> LUL @doc_ock_rokc
[7:57:30] <Manjove> the whole room is the boss
[7:57:32] <thebakaliyen> This might actually be Leon A or something if he's doing the same things as Claire
[7:57:33] <%willjar313> @TheWallOfMeat From the makers of Cards Against Humanity...
[7:57:34] <+Nomicro4u> I would like to have seen how people got around when the place was active
[7:57:35] <%Laecerelius> Umbrella was secretly doing evil science while pretending to be a pharma company
[7:57:39] <Run44forrest> Stockholders get to name the virus
[7:57:40] <AlasterAngelo> Logically thinking about Umbrella quickly exposes them as an awful company
[7:57:41] <T_Sasquatch> if this game was good it would have pvp Kappa
[7:57:42] <+TheImmortal70> In theory, if Umbrella invested in proper security, the minute someone turned into a zombie they'd be burnt to ashes
[7:57:42] <cumurasame> @Valdorick don't they have the antivirus in RE£, carlos used it on Jill
[7:57:45] <%Laecerelius> Their stock died once the whole bioweapon thing came out
[7:57:45] <+nirvana227> roarEM
[7:57:46] <KangarooCyborg> Reminds me of the Dead Space plant room
[7:57:47] <+TotesSleepyBear> That dude's pretty fat.
[7:57:50] <EmpressMoth> Where is barry
[7:57:50] <%PaladinDupre> all for that
[7:57:55] <%Shindeil> I ACTUALLY liked the Chronicles games. Not more than classic RE, but I like then.

[8:03:53] <$Mendin> The G stands for Golgotha, actually
[8:03:56] <EmpressMoth> Mr.X
[8:03:58] <BeeNoons> epic PRANK

[8:04:59] <%willjar313> Honestly, if those T-Virus samples hadn't gotten broken and infected those rats, Raccoon City likely would've lasted an extra couple weeks or so before the outbreak got to THIS level. A month, tops.
[8:04:59] <EmpressMoth> Mr.X be back
[8:05:00] <+nharliecash> solid shift
[8:05:02] <synthdrive> whenever MR. X isnt on screen somebody should be asking where MR. X is
[8:05:06] <PSI_Guy95> @Nmiser whenever he cna't find you he just finds somewhere elabroate to hide and break out

[8:11:44] <RiverBirch> Man I need another t virus resource
[8:11:46] <em0t10nalr3ck> Feel like he killed it faster with Leon than Claire
[8:11:49] <RiverBirch> gotta carve him up
[8:11:50] <切捨御免> and now we will be safe forever :)
[8:11:51] <%Laecerelius> And that's that!
[8:11:53] <+TotesSleepyBear> I hope he doesn't come back.
[8:11:55] <PSI_Guy95> "Target neutralized!" Thanks computer, now we know he's dead
[8:11:57] <Tufty1989> And that's the end of that chapter
[8:11:57] <EmpressMoth> Lol
[8:11:59] <EmpressMoth> if only
[8:12:01] <+TheWallOfMeat> At this point I've learned that nothing dies in RE
[8:12:01] <LegendaryDorkKnight> leon the pyro
[8:12:02] <Valdorick> Is it safe to just set fire to him? I can imagine inhaling the G-virus, even as ash, is good for your lungs. So much cancer.
[8:12:02] <%doc_ock_rokc> After all you knifed him so he has to be dead right @AngriestPat
[8:12:03] <%mastertwin2> So where's Mr. X?
[8:12:05] <Run44forrest> just shoot the weakpoint
[8:12:05] <waifoong98> Carve him up for some Armor HUNTER Kappa
[8:12:06] <+TheImmortal70> @angriestpat In hardcore, handgun is pretty much necessary
[8:12:07] <%nofestu2> thats the end of that
[8:12:08] <Manjove> the computer says he is dedsec, it cant be wrong!
[8:12:10] <%Laecerelius> I guess it's just in case you didn't bring enough big boy ammo
[8:12:11] <stevenschmee> Yeah Leon's weapons are built for this boss.
[8:12:13] <%jiin6> apatSmug safe at last
[8:12:13] <+BorinCorran> I did it with handgun ammo. Because I'm a cool guy!
[8:12:18] <%willjar313> You didn't collect any blood echoes. It's not over yet.
[8:12:19] <+runegod20> at least the 1911 would be better than the 9mm
[8:12:21] <EmpressMoth> The handgun ammo is for an achievement @AngriestPat
[8:12:21] <reonome> LUL
[8:12:23] <luis_verde7> his eyes dont really have much HP, i did it with matilda and magnum for center hits
[8:12:24] <allanmiri> that's the end of him
[8:12:26] <Nmiser> Yea don't forget to carve! @AngriestPat
[8:12:26] <+TheImmortal70> Also, I totally finished the final boss of this Leon B with ONLY the handgun
[8:12:27] <+SiegeJay> Is this a rerun? Kappa
[8:12:31] <turth3> I hope he doesn't return as some sort of gaping prolapsed anus with teeth
[8:12:31] <+dawsfloss> AND that's the end of that
[8:12:33] <%marvinbrewton25> i hope the train birkin i just the goopiest shit ever
[8:12:39] <%Everpresent_Overseer> knife only
[8:12:39] <+TotesSleepyBear> Use the knife to carve him up. @AngriestPat
[8:12:43] <PSI_Guy95> GOTTA CONSERVE
[8:12:45] <FatherGreyBeard> "I know the facility is self-destructing but I need these .45 bullets first"
[8:12:47] <Run44forrest> shoot her
[8:12:49] <EmpressMoth> You never use the storage box for the achievement, hence the handgun ammo @AngriestPat
[8:12:51] <sarg1010> "I lived bitch"
[8:12:59] <%Laecerelius> Man a Birkin Greatsword would probably be pretty cool!
[8:13:00] <synthdrive> looks bad
[8:13:00] <%bigdumbidiotguy> I like her edgy ripped jeans
[8:13:01] <ShichiNoBushi> Stick a fork (or knife) in him. He's done.
[8:13:02] <Nmiser> "That looks bad" LMAOOOOO
[8:13:02] <+TheWallOfMeat> What did she even shoot at him? Science goo?
[8:13:03] <MissMalisin> Poke her wounds
[8:13:04] <+SiegeJay> Pat making the same jokes
[8:13:05] <copyritetm> ive been playing on hardcore and mr x is kicking my ass
[8:13:05] <reonome> oh leon
[8:13:05] <Run44forrest> hahahaha
[8:13:05] <+TotesSleepyBear> Birkin did nothing wrong.
[8:13:09] <nobody12349> So if Leon B started the self destruct in Claire A, does that mean that fight zone got repaired, Berkin devolved to reevolve, and Annette hobbled back over to shoot him? I should stop trying to make sense of this.
[8:13:11] <waifoong98> LOEN THE GENIUS

[8:13:42] <hntronium> My boner says I'm right
[8:13:43] <EmpressMoth> Leon you poor naive boy
[8:13:43] <reonome> but she makes my pee pee hard
[8:13:45] <+TheImmortal70> "K Bitch, you thirsty, peace"
[8:13:46] <Funcokler_Xerow> "but she's hot, and she kissed me! that means sex!"
[8:13:48] <+TotesSleepyBear> Why would she move if moving causes so much pain?
[8:13:48] <%willjar313> The wrong hands? Like YOUR hands?
[8:13:52] <Tufty1989> Leon has no sense of medical emergency, didn't he do first aid training or anything?

[8:14:07] <Fwamingdwagon12> blud
[8:14:09] <%king_of_beggars> The FBI probably shouldn't have it either.
[8:14:10] <+runegod20> i feel like even without the virus, you have enough evidence
[8:14:10] <reonome> but she kissed me!
[8:14:11] <SplodeyJesus> Leon fell for the who "you rikey dis slanted vaggy?" Meme :(
[8:14:12] <LORDSPOOKLEKINS> "no but i bet you she'll suck my dick if i give it to her."
[8:14:15] <stevenschmee> Yeah Leon's character development that happens off screen and makes no sense. Really great Kappa
[8:14:15] <Valdorick> I mean, Leon, if you had a sample of Ebola, would you just fuck'n hand it over to some random FBI agent!?
