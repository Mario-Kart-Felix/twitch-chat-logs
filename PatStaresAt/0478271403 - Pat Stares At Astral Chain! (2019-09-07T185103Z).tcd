[0:02:15] <Captain_Joe1911> notekHug Hello!
[0:02:35] <+StrawberryPantsu> what kinda bizarro world shit is this?
[0:02:48] <%TranquilTurnip> Shilling for wholesomeness
[0:02:51] <Tucker0603> missed the last steam, does Pat have Axe legion yet?
[0:03:13] <Sphincter_Spelunker> "Pat, I'ma need you to come into work on Sat." "You got it, Pat."
[0:03:42] <+hazzy_o7> no axe yet
[0:03:42] <%TranquilTurnip> Nah Pat would tell Pat to fuck off
[0:03:44] <Valsunga> yo, i actually caught this one, neat, watching pats vod of river city girls while this on brb, also pat shouldn't stare at river city girls, that's impolite
[0:03:49] <KatabolicRage> he just did file 6 I think
[0:03:50] <%TranquilTurnip> if his belief on clones is anything to go on
[0:03:56] <+zaworldo> Soooooooooo is it confirmed that pat has not lost the bet
[0:04:11] <%Shadowthedigger> Shadowthedigger subscribed with Twitch Prime. They've subscribed for 14 months, currently on a 12 month streak! 14 months of crazy ginger shenanigans, time to watch while I throw money on the ground and meld all my 80 crafters today.

[0:04:31] <%blinkinthedark> apatDab apatDab
[0:04:39] <gustavozxd> half lost
[0:04:42] <%Black_Machete> pat can still win
[0:04:43] <Sphincter_Spelunker> No one lost. Costumes apparently aren't hard confirms on playable characters not being in the game in the future
[0:04:45] <%gunplagoat> gunplagoat subscribed at Tier 1. They've subscribed for 9 months! Hey pat glad hope everything is going well, shame I still cant catch the streams since its mostly games I've not played, but I still try and get in each month. also sans being a costume doesn't count -bitch Ricky
[0:04:51] <CleverUsername7777> This is gonna be a weird change in mood, considering I just watched a 3 hour podcast of people kinda shitting on the game for a bit for various legit reasons.
[0:05:10] <%Divryne> Nerd.
[0:05:14] <+zaworldo> Paige super lost though, the costume confirms that sans will NEVER be in smash
[0:05:24] <%kiiiirsten> fuck you early steam I have 2 more hours of work!!!
[0:05:39] <%TranquilTurnip> What are the primary complaints for this game?
[0:05:43] <%TranquilTurnip> I haven't heard any so far
[0:05:47] <%Kiiper> listen at wprk, it's what I'm doing
[0:05:57] <%Divryne> It’s 30FPS.
[0:06:03] <+Grayhammatter> oh no?
[0:06:05] <%blinkinthedark> Sans for Smash 6
[0:06:06] <%Divryne> That’s my only complaint.
[0:06:11] <hassanico1> @zaworldo It's less of a loss and more of a condition she'll never win, since there's still the possibility of doomguy costume
[0:06:21] <%TranquilTurnip> I blame the switch more than the game for the 30 fps thing FeelsBadMan
[0:06:24] <Cory_the_Dinosaur> gaminfKirbHi
[0:06:33] <%starotter70> Somebody help me, the shopkeeper in River City Girls is too attractive NotLikeThis
[0:06:41] <hassanico1> Also are we sure Pat is ok, what's with the early stream on a saturday
[0:06:42] <+Grayhammatter> which one otter?
[0:06:46] <Sphincter_Spelunker> @zaworldo don't know Smash. But I did see someone name an FE character(?) of them being a costume, then being in the game.
[0:06:50] <hassanico1> @starotter70 She's fictional, you'll be fine
[0:06:51] <%BestTeaMaker> the goal today: finish file 9
[0:06:53] <+Moaradin> i would have been fine with the 30 fps thing if it was at least stable
[0:06:54] <%BestTeaMaker> do it
[0:06:55] <JaerHQ> JOJO COPS roflgatorPog roflgatorPog roflgatorPog
[0:06:55] <%Ion_Laser> @starotter70 Which one? There are so many!
[0:06:56] <+Moaradin> some areas are rough
[0:07:04] <%starotter70> The one with the grey hair and abs
[0:07:08] <CleverUsername7777> Platforming's really bad, too.
[0:07:14] <+hazzy_o7> the majority of the game is stable
[0:07:31] <+Grayhammatter> yeah, that's my complaint as well @CleverUsername7777
[0:07:50] <hassanico1> I like the part where Pat has a meltdown every time he looks at abilities
[0:07:52] <CleverUsername7777> Like the chain jumps get a lot more infuriating once you realize that the legion takes up space, so you don't land on the blue indicator, you land NEXT to it.
[0:08:08] <+Grayhammatter> at least put a damn circle below the legion so we can tell where the fuck it actually is
[0:08:15] <%crimsonharvest> why does paige get to be in river city girls but not elmo
[0:08:17] <KatabolicRage> it took them 3 hours to complain about the platforming?
[0:08:18] <CleverUsername7777> Also level geometry is weeeeeird
[0:08:29] <%Black_Machete> That was my worst enemy that blue circle
[0:08:33] <CleverUsername7777> Oh it wasn't just platforming, there were other complaints.
[0:08:47] <TheLaw3D4> ALREADY? I was just coming to rewatch the rive city ransom girls stram.
[0:09:10] <CleverUsername7777> They still thought the game was above average, they just said it was probably Platinum's worst (not including TMNT or Korra)
[0:09:26] <+Grayhammatter> ah
[0:09:30] <gustavozxd> damn
[0:09:32] <CleverUsername7777> It's hard to break down 3 hours of complaints into Twitch chat messages.
[0:09:43] <StromkoPenguin> I get the sense anything would be a letdown after Automata
[0:09:46] <+Promessa_EX> here to see if game is fun. interested in the length
[0:09:49] <KatabolicRage> you just make their complaints sound highly generic and nonspecific
[0:09:59] <figysmalls_> yay
[0:10:00] <%Doruben> apatLiz
[0:10:04] <Sphincter_Spelunker> If it's not including the worst ones? Sounds like moving goal posts
[0:10:06] <%blinkinthedark> ya
[0:10:06] <gustavozxd> automata's combat was pretty basic though
[0:10:09] <CleverUsername7777> Yeah, that's my fault.
[0:10:14] <+McSnazzyPants> @Promessa_EX it's about 20-30 hours depending on how much side stuff you do from start to finish
[0:10:26] <KatabolicRage> the game has problems but I can't see how you can fill 3 hours bellyaching about it
[0:10:30] <+McSnazzyPants> add another 10-15 for completion
[0:10:42] <%zamzoph> automata is super easy
[0:10:55] <+Hmkks> Automata’s combat was the most basic out of Platinum character actions easily
[0:10:57] <%JetpackMcQuack> I just like silver chariot
[0:10:59] <CleverUsername7777> The podcast is from Gigaboots if you'd wanna hear what they have to say in depth. I'm not gonna be able to do their complaints any justice
[0:11:03] <%zamzoph> just has a lot of flash
[0:11:07] <%cvp5127> Did automata have dogde offset?
[0:11:09] <CleverUsername7777> Besides, I liked the game myself.

[0:59:29] <+ProtagonistJake> See I got an S+ cause I was an idiot and kept taking of my legion. It took so long that big boys showed up and made it hell
[0:59:33] <transporterthesequel> or the inevitable PC port a year from now(SHUT UP I CAN DREAM)
[0:59:35] <%skizzuto> there's a file later that runs like total garbage
[0:59:36] <ShichiNoBushi> Also you are mostly limited to not use your Legion. You can use it, but it still needs to Blueshift the guy to finish the mission.
[0:59:37] <+NitronStreams> the other monsters become visible when everything goes to shit so i think they can see your ghost to maybe im wrong
[0:59:37] <%starotter70> Haven't gotten any farther than this, so I'll catch you guys later
[0:59:40] <%13ry4n93> maybe it's just because I can't see for shit, but it sees fine to me?
[0:59:43] <Dragovus> Just ask yourself What would Rick Flair do? and then you will be able to style

[1:04:16] <deviljhojho94> Platforming hell
[1:04:21] <+Woronov> @AngriestPat hey pat any chance for you to check out path of exile?
[1:04:22] <%GeneralSCPatton> Subway1000 bonus100 Just came back to say Hellpoint has some cool shit. I only just learned there are DS2 style secret doors and went to scrape zones. The first zone has a secret area leading to an airlock, which subjected me to low and then no oxygen, which I never saw in the other 8 zones I've explored. Found a busted EVA suit outside before dying, upgraded/repaired it, and now I have a set that just lets me spacewalk safely.
[1:04:30] <%Yautjabutts> yo this game any good?
[1:04:34] <+ProtagonistJake> ye
[1:04:35] <+Estuko> @Yautjabutts yeah.

[1:09:30] <SlimeSlimeSlime> I want more Platinum on Switch.
[1:09:34] <%Torruun> What'd I miss hassanico1 ?
[1:09:38] <%Maids4lyfe> Nintendo deserves a good game like this
[1:09:40] <%Black_Machete> astrial chain x monster Hunter is just Freedom wars
[1:09:45] <zenith0111> rmzEVIL2 rmzTHICC rmzEVIL

[1:10:01] <zenith0111> calebK calebK calebK calebK
[1:10:02] <%arancet> just basic concepts and prototypes though
[1:10:02] <Twoiis> I can see that.
[1:10:03] <%kyh9> Yes, Scalebound was in development before Nier
[1:10:05] <+ConLin_Arts_> was it on Wii U before?
[1:10:06] <%Louie_Salmon> Some Neir definitely bled into it though
[1:10:06] <+ProtagonistJake> @13ry4n93 like I said @BoborRUU thats the closest we got @TomServal Yeah fuck it
[1:10:09] <+CCCPKi> @AngriestPat Did you also hear the director has ideas in mind for a trilogy?
[1:10:11] <Sphincter_Spelunker> It's what Scalebound could have been then
[1:10:12] <+AngriestAngryArtist> HO SHIT!
[1:10:13] <WRFWD> that means this game started as a Wii U game
[1:10:14] <SlimeSlimeSlime> Getting those hot insider tips over here!
[1:10:17] <+JacktheMan18> I bet the money they got from Nier helped fund this tbh
[1:10:21] <Virokwet> wierd
[1:10:23] <deviljhojho94> well damn
[1:10:24] <+Jonesman64> or did some of this bleed into neir?
[1:10:26] <zenith0111> RIP Scalebound
[1:10:28] <%kyh9> Yes, I agree, Scalebound looks pretty good
[1:10:36] <SlimeSlimeSlime> You can tell this baby was crafted with love.
[1:10:42] <+Hotironclad> and originally it was gonna be a medieval fantasy setting
[1:10:43] <%ElenaManetta> Yeah but that could just mean they weren't able to get the game working until they got the engine working for Nier
[1:10:46] <%Yautjabutts> when are nintendo funding a Metal Gear Rising 2
[1:10:50] <%kyh9> This game is very clearly just what Scalebound became
[1:10:57] <%ElenaManetta> Wreck It Ralph was "technically" in development for like, 10 years
[1:10:59] <%decisivelynameless> Oh what the fuck. I didn't realize you could chain those closed.
[1:11:13] <zenith0111> RIP Metal Gear Rising 2
[1:11:15] <+FackuIkari> good dog
[1:11:22] <%13ry4n93> how did you lose it pat?
[1:11:22] <Idon__> how do you lose a giant ass monster
[1:11:25] <%13ry4n93> it was big
[1:11:31] <Derkinstacker> I hope this is on the back of scalebound, it sells super well and Microsoft knows they fucked up.
[1:11:32] <artificiallynatural> what are you gonna do about it olive
[1:11:33] <+Jonesman64> you were in that tunnel for a bit
[1:11:34] <%joylent_blue> "i went into a tunnel, bitch, of course i lost sight of it"
[1:11:35] <hassanico1> I bet the Homunculus' final form is gonna be human sized
[1:11:40] <%decisivelynameless> Hit them until they closed. Which they do eventually.
[1:11:43] <%decisivelynameless> They have health bars.
[1:11:45] <%TomServal> So will the sequel be "Unchained"? Or "Unleashed"?
[1:11:45] <ShichiNoBushi> It says you can in a tutorial in File 02
[1:11:46] <+McSnazzyPants> @decisivelynameless there's a chain bind icon right next to them
[1:11:57] <TheLaw3D4> What are you gonna do about it Olive? Step on me? I'd like to see you try!

[1:14:24] <ShichiNoBushi> Pacific Ocian Southern Hemisphere.
[1:14:25] <%king_wragles> All I know is that it's NOT space
[1:14:25] <SlimeSlimeSlime> Pretty much
[1:14:26] <hassanico1> These Cat enemies are so dumb
[1:14:26] <ChamoCamouflage> Somewhere near Chile, r something
[1:14:27] <%dekkitout> Somewhere off the coast of Chile, no?
[1:14:31] <+McSnazzyPants> you are explicitly told in the first 20 minutes
[1:14:33] <%Louie_Salmon> We might be in the frame rate dimension soon though
[1:14:33] <zenith0111> Is your character really in a VR Machine?
[1:14:45] <ShichiNoBushi> The Ark was off the coast of Chile for a bit but then moved out further into the ocean.
[1:14:45] <Idon__> what, no, lmao
[1:14:46] <%Nope80808> The arc started in cuba or cuba ajecent and is now in the middle of the ocean.

[1:15:07] <+Jonesman64> Humonculus isn't a chimera
[1:15:07] <%SilvaChariot0133> "Are you sure about that?"
[1:15:08] <This_is_Marco> theyre doing their best
[1:15:09] <ChamoCamouflage> Oh, huh, since the Homunculus aren't Chimera, those people can see it.

[1:23:01] <%Louie_Salmon> By perhaps ripping it off with your arm ghost?
[1:23:07] <%13ry4n93> it looked like lady cop fondled your chest a bit
[1:23:11] <+Estuko> @SiegeJay standard npc characters becoming wife/husbands is a great thing.
[1:23:12] <Strider222> just use your IRIS to find them
[1:23:16] <StonerStan101> @AngriestPat You have to use your stands, because you are the JOJO Cop.
[1:23:17] <hassanico1> @zaworldo there are a ton of consumable and throwable items, Pat just ignores them
[1:23:22] <%miguelrod777> perhaps letting it eat you and cutting your way out
[1:23:26] <+zaworldo> Sadness

[1:33:06] <%13ry4n93> you sounded like you were about to pass out there for second, pat.
[1:33:07] <%BestTeaMaker> the game doesn't force you to perfect it
[1:33:08] <agumon9000> The ranking system in Astral Chain is really messy
[1:33:08] <+PenmanLupine> Paige isn't here to make sure Pat took his medicine for his dementia
[1:33:11] <jaid251> you did the funny now do the runny
[1:33:12] <GlongusKahn> @angriestpat kind of a weird question but did you and Woolie ever consider doing a P5 lp after the spoiler ban was taken down? Is there a chance we’ll see a P5R play through?
[1:33:13] <hassanico1> Enemy styling takes way more precedence on ranks
[1:33:21] <%BestTeaMaker> it's not messy, it just doesn't penalize you for mistakes
[1:33:27] <AmericanaRed> LUL LUL LUL LUL
[1:33:27] <%mister___doctor> It's a fucking Homonculous how hard can it be to find
[1:33:28] <%skizzuto> ranking system is kinda borked. I managed to S+ the boss on my first attempt despite dying four times
[1:33:28] <%BestTeaMaker> do more cool things = more points

[1:33:34] <%joylent_blue> LUL

[1:33:34] <%skizzuto> *final boss
[1:33:35] <%Torruun> DID YOU Pat?
[1:33:38] <%BestTeaMaker> it doesn't penalize for taking hits or dying
[1:33:38] <%DeathsDoom> @agumon9000 all it cares about is how much you do
[1:33:40] <%doc_ock_rokc> plus paige doesn't take hers
[1:33:44] <%13ry4n93> Pat's tired of being okay against his will
[1:33:52] <+PenmanLupine> you didn't take your medicine Pat that was just a handful of froot loops!
[1:33:55] <OldManDeckardCain> I look forward to the far future streams when Pat is actually getting old LUL
[1:33:56] <%joylent_blue> i never thought of sliding under the doors, thats cool
[1:33:57] <%arancet> @GlongusKahn p5 ban was technically never taken down, they just never actually enforced it, it was just to scare people
[1:34:03] <+Fynale> apperently wow's getting a big ddos attack right now
[1:34:05] <ShawnEXE> everyone start speaking in dementia to accommodate pat
[1:34:10] <agumon9000> It promotes diverse fighting style rather than mastered fighting styles
[1:34:13] <SlimeSlimeSlime> The monstars store the toilet for the Space Jam.
[1:34:18] <%13ry4n93> that was a nice picture of a broken pillar pat
[1:34:22] <baronvonkame> dementia is basically just cave speak right?
[1:34:24] <+DZiffer> Why is there only one Legion police cop man?
[1:34:30] <%SirGO0SE> LUL
[1:34:32] <+Pyroclase> Does this game have the Bioshock photo mechanic?

[1:34:36] <%ThatOneGameTester> The back door's unlocked Pat Kappa
[1:34:37] <+Jonesman64> cause you need special brain powers
[1:34:38] <+Fynale> @DZiffer right now yes
[1:34:41] <+Estuko> my dog also goes that fast when I come home from work
[1:34:43] <%mister___doctor> Gotta take a picture to put on your gravestone so people remember what you looked like
[1:34:44] <%ElenaManetta> i heard that dementia joke from the kitchen and i laughed and laugh
[1:34:44] <artificiallynatural> @DZiffer because they fucked up
[1:34:47] <ShawnEXE> The dog do spin
[1:34:50] <%DeathsDoom> weird part is you acutally get points for using medicines
[1:34:52] <%kyh9> ITS A DEAD RISING LEVEL
[1:34:59] <OldManDeckardCain> sure
[1:35:00] <deviljhojho94> oh yeah totally
[1:35:02] <%filialpails> EROTIC

[1:35:07] <%King_Wolf_Rigger> But Pat, I AM a monster
[1:35:08] <%joylent_blue> DZiffer there were more but they got fucked
[1:35:13] <+MazDoThing> So is it fair to compare this game to V in dmc5?
[1:35:16] <%13ry4n93> please, do
[1:35:20] <+DZiffer> Oh no, not the Legion police cop mans :(
[1:35:21] <gekizenbu> the game's ranking system is INCREDIBLY lenient
[1:35:22] <deviljhojho94> it is rather weird
[1:35:25] <SlimeSlimeSlime> Please teach us, Pat-Sensei
[1:35:27] <Idon__> It's weird
[1:35:27] <Charlie_Decker> I think the fact you're rewarded for using healing items is all you need to know
[1:35:28] <+zaworldo> IT SAYS RANK
[1:35:30] <%kyh9> It's a merit system rather than a de-merit system
[1:35:30] <+zaworldo> PAT
[1:35:35] <ht109> oh yes, show it to us Kreygasm
[1:35:36] <Idon__> you can die 3 times in a row and still get S+
[1:35:37] <sonicluigi123> MY GOD
[1:35:37] <ShawnEXE> Pat it's the one that says rank
[1:35:37] <%dalmek> G

[1:36:41] <%Vikken141> wow
[1:36:42] <KTDelgado> so go balls to the wall
[1:36:43] <%BestTeaMaker> they're basically shit-tier points
[1:36:43] <+Jonesman64> some things give you more points
[1:36:44] <%Scruffy_Neckbeard> They're like little bonuses for being bad

[1:36:45] <%SirGO0SE> MASH BUTTON
[1:36:46] <%DeathsDoom> basically play bad to get good rating
[1:36:48] <%13ry4n93> that sounds like a bunch of things that would make your rank worse
[1:36:48] <Hollowknight45> What?lol
[1:36:50] <%arancet> those are the crap bonuses though
[1:36:51] <sonicluigi123> WHOA WHOA WHOA
[1:36:52] <%Engwithan_Elder_God> So, be sloppy and slow and get a better rank?
[1:36:52] <%ThatOneGameTester> So wait, the worse you do, the better a rank you get?
[1:36:53] <PrimeNeverproc> damn thats dumb!
[1:36:53] <OldManDeckardCain> PLATINUM, ARE YOU OKAY?!!
[1:36:54] <shiny_prinny> put the controller down to receive a bonus!
[1:36:56] <vexion_smh> baby gaem LUL
[1:36:57] <Blank9> those bonuses are like +100 points instead of +1000
[1:36:59] <groovykrovvy> play the game badly to get a bonus
[1:36:59] <WRFWD> Some things give you more points than others
[1:37:00] <%BestTeaMaker> no, it's not play bad to get points
[1:37:00] <%ElenaManetta> I think they're just telling you a bonus for EVERY possible thing you could do so no one can be left out
[1:37:00] <%dekkitout> Ah the 'first game ease in' treatment
[1:37:01] <sonicluigi123> NONONONONOO WHAT
[1:37:02] <42nfl19> Are the rewarding you for failures?
[1:37:04] <zenith0111> WHAT ARE THESE
[1:37:05] <valriot> Okay, but the bonus you get is trivial @angriestpat
[1:37:06] <gekizenbu> there's 100 pinters and 1000 pointer rewards
[1:37:06] <%BestTeaMaker> it's you get SOME points for playing bad
[1:37:06] <Blank9> so it's a oke consolation to let you know you messed up
[1:37:11] <+Felto3> the amount of time you'd lose from standing still would be a points loss
[1:37:12] <shiny_prinny> soft reset the game to receive a bonus!
[1:37:12] <%13ry4n93> what is this game made for video game journalists?
[1:37:13] <+Jonesman64> like you only get 100 points for sloppy strikes
[1:37:13] <sonicluigi123> WHAT DIFFICULTY ARE YOU ON
[1:37:14] <%d00msdaydan> LAME IT OUT
[1:37:16] <gustavozxd> what the fuck LUL
[1:37:18] <%VantomPayne> ah, the bane of mind goblin
[1:37:20] <%SirGO0SE> do a sync attack in the sink

[1:37:30] <%BestTeaMaker> the points for those stuff you get is piddly
[1:37:33] <+JacktheMan18> HE's on normal difficulty
[1:37:35] <%Typhaeon> Hoard your items, huh
[1:37:37] <%mister___doctor> So just play the game
[1:37:39] <%BestTeaMaker> it just gives you mercy points, but it's not enough
[1:37:40] <sonicluigi123> 0_0
[1:37:41] <+xenogre> "this is are most AAA game"
[1:37:41] <%filialpails> use lots of items but ALSO hoard them
[1:37:42] <Artista_AF> LUL i don't think Platinum cares if you get high rankings in this game
[1:37:45] <%13ry4n93> what?
[1:37:49] <%ElenaManetta> It's generous
[1:37:52] <Idon__> "mission failed successfully"
[1:37:52] <groovykrovvy> Lose to get a bonus
[1:37:55] <%BestTeaMaker> meanwhile, you get huge bonuses for things like not getting hit
[1:37:55] <Charlie_Decker> i mean spamming healing items is worth 500 points. that's not nothing.
[1:38:01] <+ProtagonistJake> play the game and do a bunch of different shit
[1:38:03] <ShichiNoBushi> A lot of those have different values. A lot of the lame ones are just 100 points.
[1:38:03] <%13ry4n93> that makes sense
[1:38:04] <+Pyroclase> Is that holographic graffitti?
[1:38:06] <TheLaw3D4> IGNORE RANK AIM FOR 20K SCORE PogChamp

[1:38:14] <+Jonesman64> KILL IT!
[1:38:17] <%mister___doctor> I actually kinda like it this way because I don't have to reset the fucking mission as much when I want an S rank
[1:38:18] <%Black_Machete> I lost very hard on a boss and still got s+
[1:38:18] <+futer> Huh the 30 fps doesnt seem so noticable
[1:38:19] <BoborRUU> NOTORIOUS BIG
[1:38:23] <+ProtagonistJake> I wonder if P ultimate is more strict in that sense tho
[1:38:24] <%ElenaManetta> It seems like it gives bonuses for every possible play style so as not to FORCE people to play in one "superior" way
[1:38:25] <WRFWD> I mean, attacking multiple times and hitting nothing while surrounded by enemies takes a lot of skill

[1:38:28] <+waterbuddy16> asbolute lad
[1:38:29] <sonicluigi123> -_-
[1:38:30] <Blank9> guns don't work on slimes
[1:38:31] <%Dr_DangerPhD> Honestly it seems like as long as you're beating fights super fast you'll get S+ every single time
[1:38:35] <%filialpails> it's a rare form!
[1:38:35] <Onmi_Khaos> Pupper has failed us
[1:38:37] <%joylent_blue> the Sword legion is best for slimes i've found
[1:38:38] <Mahuloq> So how is this game so far
[1:38:39] <Dragovus> BoOOOOOOOOOOOOOO!
[1:38:39] <%skizzuto> doggo legion is terrible for those imo. sword works better in my experience
[1:38:42] <SlimeSlimeSlime> You took too much slime.
[1:38:43] <%arancet> the one in the mall is the hardest
[1:38:44] <%TranquilTurnip> @AngriestPat Vinny Vinesauce's like, first openworld enemy ever, was a metal slime and he didn't realize how good it was
[1:38:46] <OldManDeckardCain> Astral Chain is just an offline MMO, the optimal way is just to rotate your skills and literally manage your cooldowns
[1:38:47] <Derkinstacker> use arm to drag it to you, hit it with cleaver.
[1:38:48] <WRFWD> Sword legion is the best for slimes
[1:38:50] <rosemon5001> fail go up
[1:38:56] <%13ry4n93> bad doggy, no biscuit
[1:39:01] <jubejube56> If only the dog legion had a way for you to close the distance faster...
[1:39:02] <hassanico1> he knows he doesn't do damage to them with the bton right?

[1:39:12] <Onmi_Khaos> So what have I missed story wise
[1:39:13] <Artista_AF> this ranking system s pretty much Participation Trophy LUL
[1:39:20] <artificiallynatural> big green
[1:39:21] <SulfurousAcid> Bigger Gorilla
[1:39:23] <%TranquilTurnip> thats a bug
[1:39:25] <Idon__> look at those hulk hands
[1:39:26] <%Laecerelius> hahaha
[1:39:28] <%joylent_blue> MINOTAURUS
[1:39:28] <%BestTeaMaker> @AngriestPat just a note about those points, the shit stuff like sloppy strikes give you really small amount of points, basically pity points
[1:39:30] <42nfl19> After Pat got released from prison, anything important happen or is this the mission where he works with his sister?
[1:39:35] <hassanico1> Why not "Asterious"? Minotaur seems to stick out among names
[1:39:40] <shiny_prinny> SMOrc
[1:39:43] <SulfurousAcid> How will Pat do against stronger Gorilla?
[1:39:50] <%BestTeaMaker> but the game does reward you heavily for doing actual things like not getting hit
[1:39:51] <Idon__> no PICTURES
[1:39:53] <Onmi_Khaos> Last I remember is our sister got stabbed and we went to what was absolutely not the final level
[1:39:54] <+NitronStreams> quick someone build a labrynth
[1:40:03] <Idon__> bruh this camera is insane
[1:40:07] <%13ry4n93> he gonna kidnap you to framerate land?
[1:40:14] <hassanico1> @Onmi_Khaos that was like 2 streams ago
[1:40:20] <zenith0111> I think those are hit stops
[1:40:25] <%joylent_blue> Onmi_Khaos you missed the really hype part at the end of last stream then
[1:40:36] <TheLaw3D4> @Idon__ It's trash, but changing the setting does help quite a bit.
[1:40:39] <hassanico1> The best part about this game is all the Dutch angles
[1:40:48] <sonicluigi123> Low rank please
[1:40:49] <SulfurousAcid> should've healed for a bonus
[1:40:55] <%joylent_blue> regular S
[1:40:57] <sonicluigi123> I'LL TAKE THAT
[1:40:58] <%joylent_blue> no + for u
[1:40:58] <%Kashi_Nin> @AngriestPat Beast Legion kinda has a REDBULL13 attack animation sometimes. His big ol' spin move.
[1:40:59] <+DZiffer> Pat, you missed a doggo pile
[1:41:00] <sonicluigi123> YESSS
[1:41:01] <%Laecerelius> Not healing gives you a bigger bonus
[1:41:03] <%13ry4n93> @hassanico1 so like battlefield earth
[1:41:09] <T_Sasquatch> THAT was an S ? lmao
[1:41:15] <hassanico1> @13ry4n93 but good
[1:41:23] <%BestTeaMaker> chat, rankings are not based on being perfect, it's based on doing cool things
[1:41:26] <hassanico1> no
[1:41:27] <%Torruun> I get that feeling
[1:41:27] <SulfurousAcid> nooooooooooo
[1:41:28] <cherrycottontail> lol nope

[1:41:50] <%joylent_blue> LUL
[1:41:51] <%arancet> @42nfl19 shut up tho
[1:41:54] <SulfurousAcid> axe legion post game content obviously
[1:41:55] <TheLaw3D4> @BestTeaMaker They are far too lenient with score, it should be "do cool things" and "play well"
[1:41:58] <deviljhojho94> big brain crikIQ
[1:41:59] <BoborRUU> @angriestpat what difficultly is this on
[1:42:00] <%Typhaeon> What a polite homu
[1:42:01] <+DZiffer> shopping cart too strong pls nerf
[1:42:02] <+NitronStreams> axe legion was actually removed from the game
[1:42:07] <transporterthesequel> got that Nezuko tech
[1:42:13] <%Mr_Strut> I got rum and a grilled cheese sandwich. I'm a happy man.
[1:42:15] <sonicluigi123> @boborruu apparently normal
[1:42:15] <%13ry4n93> look at how the sword clips through walls
[1:42:16] <groovykrovvy> he had to take the stairs
[1:42:18] <VJdarkworld> Switch axe legion
[1:42:23] <jubejube56> That crafty homunculus is evolving too quickly
[1:42:29] <%joylent_blue> its the highest difficulty on your first playthrough
[1:42:32] <%13ry4n93> working 9-5
[1:42:35] <%BestTeaMaker> @TheLaw3D4 i'm fine with the rankings being lenient cause you get huge points for actually doing cool things, and tries to get you to do things like use items because' they're actually worth using
[1:42:39] <cherrycottontail> Axe legion is ACTUALLY Haru
[1:42:49] <%BestTeaMaker> Bayo1 style rankings are bad and terrible to actually strive for because of its demand for being perfect
[1:42:51] <deviljhojho94> He is sleeping :)
[1:42:55] <%13ry4n93> it's getting bigger
[1:42:57] <Dragovus> Puts the Mass Effect Elevators to shame
[1:43:01] <Derkinstacker> He's doing your job for you.
[1:43:04] <SlimeSlimeSlime> Picture from the roof?
[1:43:04] <hassanico1> @BestTeaMaker yes, so much
[1:43:04] <%Typhaeon> also known as chimmeruss
[1:43:07] <SulfurousAcid> I like chi meras better now
[1:43:08] <%13ry4n93> you don't say olive
[1:43:11] <Idon__> even YOU
[1:43:12] <%Keyd00d> D:
[1:43:14] <$psydaku> when do you get the camera?
[1:43:24] <AmericanaRed> cmonBruh
[1:43:26] <SulfurousAcid> This is my story
[1:43:27] <%joylent_blue> Bayo's ranking system is so fucking stressful, i do prefer the more lenient ones, like this and DMC5
[1:43:27] <gustavozxd> @BestTeaMaker that sounds like a scrubquote to me ngl
[1:43:29] <jubejube56> Why exactly do we want to stop the homunculus again?
[1:43:31] <hassanico1> Pat when will you drunk status effect wear off?
[1:43:31] <+JacktheMan18> the herro
[1:43:31] <T_Sasquatch> herro
[1:43:32] <%kyh9> So we all agree that this is actually just Digimon with Kamen Rider and NGE, right?
[1:43:33] <+NitronStreams> even your huge dick might not be huge enough
[1:43:34] <%mister___doctor> Having this be the only inhabitable spot on Earth is a good excuse to not have people want to fucking move after this.
[1:43:35] <groovykrovvy> Even you, Mr Main Character Man
[1:43:36] <%joylent_blue> although DMC5 does have some weird outliers in that regard
[1:43:39] <%ThatOneGameTester> i wonder what the chances of pat passing out on stream is. i want to say 0 but he's pretty tired
[1:43:45] <TheLaw3D4> @BestTeaMaker Totally disagree, S+ is supposed to be for playing well, not just a participation trophy.
[1:43:52] <Sphincter_Spelunker> We're the antibiotics that shouldn't be used monkaS
[1:43:57] <%1matheuw> why is pat so tired?
[1:43:58] <Artista_AF> @psydaku when you meet Lappy all the way back
[1:43:59] <+Jonesman64> this area confuses me
[1:44:02] <sonicluigi123> Really
[1:44:02] <Idon__> Pat, there's another ladder in the alley between the buildings
[1:44:03] <%BestTeaMaker> @TheLaw3D4 it's still not a participation trophy. just because rankings are easier doesn't mean they're for free
[1:44:04] <%skizzuto> he would end the stream before it got to that point
[1:44:04] <deviljhojho94> tomatoReally
[1:44:05] <%13ry4n93> yeah, pat! slowborn it!
[1:44:08] <hassanico1> Passing gas on stream though...
[1:44:09] <%Laecerelius> Pat has consumed too much Red Bull for that to happen
[1:44:11] <+DZiffer> V would right fit into the setting of this game, he even has his own Legions!
[1:44:13] <%skizzuto> turn on your iris
[1:44:13] <%BestTeaMaker> and pt ultimate AND file 12 are a pain
[1:44:13] <Derkinstacker> use IRIS
[1:44:13] <%Louie_Salmon> What if there was a really cutscene where nothing happens
[1:44:14] <%doc_ock_rokc> ladder in other alleyway
[1:44:16] <%Dr_DangerPhD> @TheLaw3D4 if you want S+ ranks to be harder play on higher difficulties, it's not that complicated
[1:44:17] <%BestTeaMaker> they're really freaking hard
[1:44:17] <%Torruun> Oh no guys! Pat fell asleep! apatPorgmo
[1:44:19] <Idon__> Use the arrow legion to shoot down ladder
[1:44:19] <ht109> now that he mentioned it, the changes have increased

[1:48:47] <42nfl19> Akira's uniform reminds me of the Gantz costumes how it goes all the way up her neck.
[1:48:52] <MasterDecoder> @Spiralpower1620 Red Cop is Vergil

[1:49:04] <TheLaw3D4> @BestTeaMaker I don't have to think something is the end of the world to be able to explain why it's flawed.
[1:49:05] <%Louie_Salmon> So they all had legs, and legs were deem inefficient for ghosts? Seems like a very simple change to make them legions
[1:49:07] <Sphincter_Spelunker> @Spiralpower1620 Our sword stand is Vergil. It has summoned swords

[2:41:14] <+ProtagonistJake> doesnt matter what order you do them in just talk to Jin
[2:41:15] <%redrins> shoulda dropped them more
[2:41:15] <+CCCPKi> S+ing this file is a goddamn nightmare
[2:41:17] <+McSnazzyPants> @VektorTroika it's actually pretty easy, i dropped boxes like 3 times and redshifted two dudes and got it. unless it's harder in pt ultimate
[2:41:18] <%AgentOrangeShoes> 7.8/10, too many boxes
[2:41:19] <%Big_Dream> @AngriestPat its jsut the 2nd file but xpaned

[2:41:24] <+Jonesman64> and it HURTS
[2:41:27] <%floralkami> God, i FUCKING HATE when people call mini games and optional side quests "padding". It's literally OPTIONAL.
[2:41:30] <zenith0111> Fun Game :)
[2:41:30] <+kraajkase> Pat got "tilted"
[2:41:31] <+burritocheetos> D:

[2:41:46] <hassanico1> Pat your sense of direction is becoming worse than Paige's @AngriestPat
[2:41:49] <startstoprepeat> this game really got pat into the cop mindset
[2:41:52] <+Sutibun95> HOES MAD
[2:41:52] <%rumtumtugnutz> Uh oh. Cranky Pat incoming
[2:41:56] <zenith0111> HAHAHAHA
[2:41:58] <Strider222> yeah
[2:41:59] <%kyh9> Yes
[2:42:02] <%Keyd00d> yes
[2:42:02] <+ProtagonistJake> yes
[2:42:02] <UnfilteredComic> yea
[2:42:02] <+burritocheetos> ye
[2:42:02] <+temporal_zenith> it is
[2:42:02] <WRFWD> Yes
[2:42:03] <+Jonesman64> roughly
[2:42:03] <%kyh9> That's the starting area
[2:42:05] <Derkinstacker> Cant wait til the Jin minigame with the cars
[2:42:13] <Brainworm205> !uptime
[2:42:13] <MasterDecoder> Don't be upsetti, get some spaghetti
[2:42:13] <@Moobot> I've been playing this game for how long? Oh only 2h 42m.
[2:42:14] <%13ry4n93> I'm getting kinda hungry, what food should I get chat?
[2:42:16] <Laveyrin> this box minigame is why pat didnt play shenmue
[2:42:17] <%Keyd00d> apatGoblin
[2:42:18] <VJdarkworld> I had fun with all these side quests :)
[2:42:19] <spicyramengaming> But this game looks legit bad tho. Looking like a budget title.
[2:42:23] <+ProtagonistJake> that sounds like a disorder
[2:42:25] <hassanico1> @13ry4n93 pizzaburger
[2:42:29] <%rumtumtugnutz> Shenmue is overrated
[2:42:32] <gekizenbu> a grid is a 2d array of CUBES
[2:42:35] <%marsanta> Pat likes cubes in all forms
[2:42:35] <%arancet> @AngriestPat but map and iris point out the cases, so no big deal losing track here
[2:42:36] <%kyh9> Cartesian bitch
[2:42:36] <MasterDecoder> @ProtagonistJake It's well known
[2:42:38] <%BoboDaHobo> pat? anxious? whaaaaaat?
[2:42:41] <UnfilteredComic> use iris too
[2:42:46] <%13ry4n93> @hassanico1 not sure if that's murican enough
[2:42:48] <+VektorTroika> but what if the grid was made of hexagons...or circles?
[2:42:56] <+McSnazzyPants> ye ye ye heavy traffic
[2:42:59] <hassanico1> @13ry4n93 fried ice cream?
[2:42:59] <%Keyd00d> he says as he wanders around randomly
[2:43:02] <zenith0111> I'm gonna go play Iceborne :)
[2:43:07] <+ProtagonistJake> I refuse
[2:43:08] <MrCalieb> I need to explore every crevice in video games otherwise i feel wrong
[2:43:14] <%rumtumtugnutz> You can't make a grid out of circles
[2:43:16] <@commanderclaw> What about dungeons? You can't always go in a grid
[2:43:20] <UnfilteredComic> Roundhouse your sister
[2:43:24] <%13ry4n93> @hassanico1 ah yes, that staple from the american heartland: Mexico!
[2:43:26] <%supersugoisenpai1> Sprint into those dudes carrying boxes
[2:43:33] <%dekkitout> Block's Haunted!
[2:43:35] <+CaptainGrime> what the fuck
[2:43:37] <%Divryne> Woaw.
[2:43:37] <nostalgia_junkie_music> ???????//

[2:43:38] <MrCalieb> Force the grid
[2:43:38] <%skizzuto> what was that unholy noise you just made
[2:43:39] <%Keyd00d> nice noise
[2:43:40] <vexion_smh> WutFace
[2:43:41] <SlimeSlimeSlime> Did pat just become a raptor for a second there?
[2:43:42] <rosemon5001> piss ya pants?
[2:43:42] <%Segartner> nice noise
[2:43:43] <hassanico1> @13ry4n93 you could say it's at the center of America
[2:43:48] <%arancet> non-euclidian grid
[2:43:51] <+Jonesman64> missed an area by shizu
[2:43:53] <MrCalieb> bless
[2:43:54] <%demegodz> The fuck
[2:43:57] <VJdarkworld> saintrMonkaS
[2:43:59] <%odinthepirate> that's what she said
[2:43:59] <+FackuIkari> that was not a hiccup
[2:43:59] <nostalgia_junkie_music> bless
[2:43:59] <%supersugoisenpai1> Pat needs a Metroid map that fills in pink where he's been
[2:44:01] <%Torruun> Oh no. Pat's lizardman-ness is showing
[2:44:01] <%Divryne> Can you force a CIRCLE INTO A GRID PAT?!
[2:44:01] <%Dr_DangerPhD> the elmo-fication is progressing nicely
[2:44:04] <%13ry4n93> "wiaza"
[2:44:06] <Laveyrin> ghost trying to escape pat right now
[2:44:10] <zenith0111> All these Squares make a circle MrDestructoid
[2:44:12] <hassanico1> Pat making KomodoHype noises
[2:44:13] <%Keyd00d> nice akira slide
[2:44:13] <%13ry4n93> is that like a clothing brand?
[2:44:17] <jubejube56> Oh god this one
[2:44:25] <+McSnazzyPants> this is the one that sucks
[2:44:26] <gekizenbu> the mini game file
[2:44:29] <%Keyd00d> have fun with this terrible game
[2:44:38] <Charlie_Decker> i find this one to be super hard to S+
[2:44:45] <+Jonesman64> there are hidden spots too
[2:44:47] <%supersugoisenpai1> This one is fucked
[2:44:51] <+temporal_zenith> This mission feels like it should be called "let's let the new guy do our job for us"
[2:44:55] <WRFWD> Clean the red matter too Pat
[2:45:01] <jubejube56> No clear explanation of the rules and no way to restart it. Suck a dumb case
[2:45:07] <+McSnazzyPants> are the hidden spots at least static in this one?
[2:45:11] <Charlie_Decker> you can restart it
[2:45:16] <+McSnazzyPants> if they change then FUCK getting s+ on this
[2:45:24] <+VektorTroika> this tune is beginning to give off Spyro energy
[2:45:25] <spicyramengaming> Serious question here: What was the last good game Platinum released?
[2:45:27] <%ElenaManetta> opening a glass bottle is a lot easier with a tool than your hand
[2:45:33] <+ProtagonistJake> no
[2:45:34] <jubejube56> Wait how do you restart it? Leave the case from the pause menu?
[2:45:34] <%supersugoisenpai1> No
[2:45:36] <%BestTeaMaker> no
[2:45:38] <%arancet> no red matter isnt increasing score
[2:45:40] <Captain_Aham> rut roo scoob
[2:45:44] <%dekkitout> Well, at least the spots aren't procedural
[2:45:45] <+McSnazzyPants> @jubejube56 press - and it'll pause
[2:45:49] <Charlie_Decker> thought you could restart it if you just paused or some shit. you can restart the Box one and Alan's one
[2:45:54] <Charlie_Decker> so I don't see why you can't restart this one
[2:45:55] <+McSnazzyPants> you can restart just the red case
[2:46:05] <MrCalieb> more like red doesnt matter hurhurrahhelpme
[2:46:19] <+Jonesman64> I didn't find out about the hidden dig spots till this minigame...
[2:46:32] <+McSnazzyPants> what's the score threshold for this one, anyone know?
[2:46:44] <+ProtagonistJake> now theres some in the other parts of the map
[2:46:48] <TheLaw3D4> Usually S+ is 10k
[2:46:59] <Charlie_Decker> sure as fuck not 10k for this
[2:47:02] <Charlie_Decker> i think maybe 3k
[2:47:02] <StonerStan101> Just a stand user taking his stand out for a walk.
[2:47:05] <ThorgrimFunhammer> extra dimensional doggo
[2:47:22] <MrCalieb> seems like a good boy
[2:47:48] <+VektorTroika> TIME EXTENDED
[2:48:16] <%joylent_blue> i think i got a D on that one FeelsBadMan
[2:48:17] <Charlie_Decker> yeah so it's 3k
[2:48:17] <+McSnazzyPants> 3k then, that's pretty reasonable
[2:48:21] <%ElenaManetta> I'm starting to feel bad for these slaves. All powerful and you're using them for literal garbage.
[2:48:25] <+McSnazzyPants> i got a d cause i turned retarded
[2:48:27] <+VektorTroika> Smokin'+
[2:48:32] <MrCalieb> is that leash the astral chain in question?
[2:48:38] <Charlie_Decker> ya
[2:48:41] <%arancet> @ElenaManetta yeah, but, you know, the murder
[2:48:45] <MrCalieb> sick
[2:48:51] <%13ry4n93> be obstinate pat
[2:48:51] <nostalgia_junkie_music> why tho
[2:48:52] <+ProtagonistJake> thats correct
[2:48:54] <%BestTeaMaker> @AngriestPat the game will tell you if you want to move on
[2:48:54] <+Felto3> theres a check to see if you want progress
[2:48:55] <+Jonesman64> It warns you too if you get to close to the main goal
[2:48:56] <artificiallynatural> this is gonna take forever
[2:48:57] <WRFWD> The get ready because this is going to be veeery long
[2:49:00] <%Keyd00d> h-haha
[2:49:01] <%XzileGaming> Dont feed the corpses
[2:49:05] <%joylent_blue> ride your dog over the dead bodies
[2:49:05] <UnfilteredComic> Its really obvious, theres a dialogue where it tells you, "This is progression"
[2:49:06] <+burritocheetos> what if the place want you to go is the one you think the game doesnt want you to go
[2:49:06] <%dekkitout> Main objective? lol wusdat? :3
[2:49:07] <Tonicky > cop just sitting on a dead body
[2:49:18] <artificiallynatural> I gave up halfway through the picture mission
[2:49:19] <+Pyroclase> she's sitting on a corpse oh my god
[2:49:20] <+TooManyBadgerss> Was that dude just chillin, sitting on the corpses?
[2:49:25] <Sphincter_Spelunker> where's Kyle :(
[2:49:25] <%Keyd00d> monkaS
[2:49:27] <%rumtumtugnutz> Aparently if you find Marie here you can get a lappy piece
[2:49:28] <TheLaw3D4> You can find the side quest easy just by using IRIS and going to red markers
[2:49:48] <+Jonesman64> this one is fun
[2:49:48] <ShadeTheNovice> That file is like radioactive of something

[2:54:33] <+Jonesman64> Have your legion attack him
[2:54:34] <+Pyroclase> Imagine being a random dumb kid, and then a cop comes after you riding on a giant wolf with a laser sword.
[2:54:43] <guardianspirit5> Dog just tank it, you really need to buff your dog's crowd control resistance
[2:54:45] <MrCalieb> super mega doing pretty funny bits with dem japan videos

[2:55:01] <%Keyd00d> RIP
[2:55:01] <%BestTeaMaker> shoot your legion at him
[2:55:03] <Strider222> hahaha
[2:55:04] <VJdarkworld> Graffiti = ART, jet set radio taught me

[2:55:16] <%miguelrod777> its a real object
[2:55:22] <jubejube56> Art transcends stand power
[2:55:22] <%PaleBloodInk> You can go back to where he first was and start again.
[2:55:22] <Derkinstacker> Go back to where he was
[2:55:26] <%BestTeaMaker> start over
[2:55:28] <+Jonesman64> LEGION DISLIKE SMOKE
[2:55:28] <%arancet> hell respawn at start
[2:55:28] <%Keyd00d> restart where he was
[2:55:29] <MrCalieb> fart gas and bio slime are my favourite things
[2:55:30] <Charlie_Decker> i can't believe he straight up escaped
[2:55:35] <PrimeNeverproc> he supposed to get away
[2:55:39] <%vectorless_peon> dont have to reload just do something else and go back to his spot
[2:55:39] <+ProtagonistJake> you can dodge through the smoke
[2:55:39] <%joylent_blue> he always returns to the scene of the crime
[2:55:43] <%floralkami> YOU FEEL WHAT THE LEGION FEELS, PAT
[2:55:46] <%BestTeaMaker> @AngriestPat you can throw your legion out at him to stun him

[2:56:03] <MrCalieb> drop your legion
[2:56:10] <%redrins> or just arrow him
[2:56:13] <%Keyd00d> that's what it taught you to do yeah
[2:56:13] <Sphincter_Spelunker> If people can't see the legion, what does riding beast look like
[2:56:16] <Onmi_Khaos> this is a stand user being outsmarted by the bog standard human using pocket sand

[3:14:24] <skinmansgds> I wanted to get back to actual gameplay
[3:14:25] <+Felto3> how many parts will this take woolie?
[3:14:27] <jubejube56> Third one wasn’t too bad, just had to be patient with it
[3:14:30] <+exploitativity2> @Big_Dream go to hell
[3:14:32] <WRFWD> Remember Pat, the timer doesn't matter, only how many moves you use
[3:14:35] <VJdarkworld> Baba is legion , car is move
[3:14:38] <+exploitativity2> timer DOES matter
[3:14:40] <%Black_Machete> this is 2 of 3 the last one will kill him
[3:14:40] <%Big_Dream> what
[3:14:49] <+exploitativity2> you can get S+ with more than 35 moves if you're fast enough
[3:14:50] <%Big_Dream> i am good at puzzles
[3:14:54] <redial_nick> and i thought you played the professor layton games... DansGame
[3:14:54] <+exploitativity2> too good
[3:15:24] <%mister___doctor> Oh look the best part of the game
[3:15:27] <+rei0> trapped
[3:15:27] <Edible_Enthusiasm> I'm pretty sure two white cars need to be in the lower right
[3:15:28] <%joylent_blue> no fuck u
[3:15:33] <MrCalieb> is this better than boxes
[3:15:38] <WRFWD> I spent here like an eternity and got an S+, well in the third puzzle
[3:15:38] <+exploitativity2> btw you can actually gay baby jail in this
[3:15:41] <waifoong98> Jeez Pat

[3:17:14] <Derkinstacker> remamber pat, the bus HAS to be on the left side.
[3:17:22] <+exploitativity2> pat, ask yourself where things can fit
[3:17:22] <%skizzuto> @AngriestPat hint: the bus needs to go on the left
[3:17:28] <Tisaric> This puzzle has only 1 solution

[3:17:49] <+kraajkase> The real Astral Chain starts now!
[3:17:50] <Edible_Enthusiasm> the legion really hates this.
[3:17:50] <+exploitativity2> @Big_Dream nobody cares if you found it easy
[3:17:52] <+exploitativity2> nobody cares
[3:18:06] <%ToadKing> oh boy i came back just in time
[3:18:09] <TheLaw3D4> I care
[3:18:14] <TheLaw3D4> Good job
[3:18:15] <%vectorless_peon> the trick is to make enough space on the left side for the bus

[3:18:17] <+exploitativity2> Clap
[3:18:19] <+exploitativity2> oh fuck

[3:19:07] <%rdark_ksu> a block puzzle?
[3:19:19] <Edible_Enthusiasm> what do we do with the bus
[3:19:25] <jubejube56> Been a while since I did this puzzle but I feel like a reset might already be required
[3:19:26] <%Big_Dream> trapped yourself
[3:19:29] <Strider222> TRAPPED
[3:19:30] <sonicluigi123> HOW
[3:19:36] <Derkinstacker> Move the little car out of the right side.
[3:19:42] <@commanderclaw> Pat's doing way better with this than I would, I suck at these kinds of puzzles
[3:19:45] <Derkinstacker> and push the long car down.
[3:19:46] <%Ixiah> Paige should hide Pats sweets behind puzzles like that, he will never eat sweets again Kappa
[3:19:47] <+BoomerTiro> Pat play more chess.
[3:19:55] <daisyyyy> im pretty sure i gave up on this one after an hour
[3:19:55] <%MrCalieb> MrCalieb subscribed at Tier 1. 
[3:20:07] <%drabberfaun535> why is pat playing car tetris?

[3:20:31] <%joylent_blue> all for the S+
[3:20:33] <%arancet> what sucks ass about this isnt so much the moving cars part, but all the limitations and how you can move, with you blocking yourself so easily
[3:20:34] <%skizzuto> Because ANIME COPS
[3:20:34] <Graxe_> This is more like those box puzzles from Nier

[3:21:23] <%vectorless_peon> you almost had it
[3:21:25] <Derkinstacker> You were like 4 moves away.
[3:21:26] <+Memnarch7> Did Pat beat RCG?
[3:21:28] <VJdarkworld> Baba is STUCK
[3:21:28] <TheLaw3D4> Why are you like this
[3:21:33] <+Risingxiv> he was so close first try, dang
[3:21:33] <KingKZ> The game has defeated you.
[3:21:37] <BluBox> You were so close too :(
[3:21:40] <Zaphire_Saucypants> might as well do it over. Aboooort.
[3:21:46] <+VektorTroika> Pat can maintain mental continuity for approximately 2 minutes before lapsing

[3:22:20] <%Edgy_Macaroon> get the vans to the right side
[3:22:23] <MasterDecoder> @PeachSaliva still here?
[3:22:26] <+Muzzle131> What are we doing exactly?
[3:22:30] <tequilazaku> i cannot understand why you tried to mokove a car on the right, they were in the perfect position
[3:22:38] <Zaphire_Saucypants> this position's gonna fuck ya.
[3:22:41] <%Ixiah> where is paige, did she move out after pat refused to accept she won the Sans bet ? :P
[3:22:44] <+Jonesman64> dont be too quick to recall your legion
[3:22:51] <%Divryne> YOU HAVE it.

[3:23:03] <liflamor> watching pat suffer through puzzles is a joy

[3:23:32] <mostundesired> Oh boy, brute smarts NotLikeThis
[3:23:32] <+HyperCharge_Sam> Bus has to go on the left, horizontal cars have to go on the right
[3:23:35] <valriot> GET PAIGE TO HELP
[3:23:36] <%ToadKing> the only real solution is to skip this
[3:23:38] <waifoong98> Not Hints chat LUL
[3:23:42] <corepercentlives> oh a puzzle MingLee
[3:23:43] <Zaphire_Saucypants> and for this, the "journey" to that solution is the real ordeal.
[3:23:43] <%Edgy_Macaroon> move the vans down
[3:23:51] <%13ry4n93> things got quiet while i was away
[3:23:54] <sonicluigi123> -_-
[3:23:54] <nostalgia_junkie_music> YOU HAD IT
[3:23:54] <%dekkitout> So why exactly cant the Punch Boi lift these whips and yeet them out of the way
[3:23:55] <+Pyroclase> I need 20 minutes to pick up pizza, hopefully he'll be done by the time I'm back
[3:23:58] <%Edgy_Macaroon> move the cars out
[3:24:00] <+Caped_Eggy> I'm just gonna go watch cat videos
[3:24:05] <%Louie_Salmon> Having to worry about where your character is instead of just where the blocks are is rough
[3:24:06] <+Darren716> Don't restart, abort, that way you reset the time
[3:24:07] <koolaid_kevster> you need 1 of those cars on the left to be on the right with the 2 small cars like you had them @angriestpat
[3:24:11] <OldManDeckardCain> welcome to the rest of the stream vod users LUL
[3:24:13] <nostalgia_junkie_music> @Pyroclase can i have some, am hungry
[3:24:18] <+kraajkase> @Pyroclase dont bet on it
[3:24:18] <%Edgy_Macaroon> can to the bottom
[3:24:21] <+Darren716> Restarting carries over the timer
[3:24:24] <Zaphire_Saucypants> mostly requiring the itty bitty cars to be repositioned multiple times.
[3:24:24] <valriot> "Alexa, play Groose's theme"
[3:24:30] <MasterDecoder> !uptime
[3:24:31] <@Moobot> I've been playing this game for how long? Oh only 3h 24m.
[3:24:32] <%Keyd00d> monkaS
[3:24:34] <%mister___doctor> Pat please I've been dancing to this music since you started this puzzle my arms are tired
[3:24:35] <%Big_Dream> @AngriestPat one of the tiny cars needs to on the left if your goona push the bus to the right
[3:24:35] <sonicluigi123> Yeah, Ive been watching videos for a while now, Ima come back here in another bit LUL
[3:24:36] <+alpacasintophats> full restarting resets the timer
[3:24:43] <MasterDecoder> It's not
[3:24:47] <+alpacasintophats> as in quitting out of the minigame and restarting the quest
[3:24:53] <PrimeNeverproc> its not
[3:25:00] <+exploitativity2> @Big_Dream have you noticed that you can't actually push the bus to the right
[3:25:03] <+ProtagonistJake> thats the do it
[3:25:03] <%Edgy_Macaroon> move the vans down
[3:25:05] <+exploitativity2> are you sure you finished this puzzle
[3:25:06] <liflamor> Its actually very easy
[3:25:19] <%Nope80808> @alpacasintophats Thats why you do that after you figure it out
[3:25:23] <%Big_Dream> you can its harder
[3:25:25] <waifoong98> oh god
[3:25:30] <%Nope80808> us this time to figure it out
[3:25:39] <+exploitativity2> What I mean is the actual solution cannot have the bus on the right
[3:25:47] <+exploitativity2> because of the 3 horizontal 2-length cars.
[3:25:50] <%Edgy_Macaroon> move the cars out
[3:26:00] <+exploitativity2> That necessarily have to be on the right, because the left is 1-wide
[3:26:00] <VJdarkworld> Pats gonna need paige’s help
[3:26:02] <waifoong98> @exploitativity2 yeah just put a car on the right and the bus on the left
[3:26:04] <%dalmek> oH
[3:26:14] <mostundesired> Almost....
[3:26:19] <Zaphire_Saucypants> Pat may not read this, but what he needs to do is start out with those two cars in the bottom right of the yellow lane, vertically. That clears up space to move the vans.
[3:26:23] <xinexes> reset
[3:26:24] <+exploitativity2> Yeah, this guy's saying you can put the bus on the right? At least, the final solution cannot have the bus on the right
[3:26:24] <+alpacasintophats> @Nope80808 yeah but does Pat know that
[3:26:37] <MasterDecoder> So close
[3:26:40] <%Sovspot> I figured it out
[3:26:40] <+kraajkase> Pats first attempt was the closest
[3:26:41] <chaseyd> Oh he's on this puzzle...I was here for an hour...
[3:26:44] <Derkinstacker> Reset
[3:26:54] <+parrotman01> Relax
[3:26:58] <%Nope80808> 3 horizonal vans in the bottom right quadrant 2 small cars vertically in the top right quadrant there will be space for the bus after that.
[3:27:01] <+parrotman01> You almost had it the firsttime, you can do it
[3:27:01] <%spacehouse> PHUC
[3:27:05] <Derkinstacker> Dont push the tiny cars in
[3:27:05] <+ProtagonistJake> if you quit the mission you can reset the time too
[3:27:05] <%VanaSkiller> how can this beeeee
[3:27:08] <%dekkitout> I like to think Jin and Akira are laughing their smug asses seeing your character's brain fry
[3:27:08] <%Divryne> FUCK.
[3:27:08] <%thewisewolf> I've only watched for 30 seconds and I've already figured it out LUL
[3:27:10] <chaseyd> I won't give the solution but if you're anal about S+'ing this mission, just abandon the mission and do a full restart once you figure it out. Good luck Pat!
[3:27:10] <Derkinstacker> get all the long cars into the right side.
[3:27:11] <+NeonBleu> welcome to the rest of the stream
[3:27:14] <+Darren716> Yeah pause and abort the missions, you reset your timer
[3:27:16] <Captain_Aham> dig up stupid
[3:27:23] <%MrCalieb> ten minutes...
[3:27:27] <%d00msdaydan> at least this music is great
[3:27:29] <TheLaw3D4> Ded
[3:27:30] <deviljhojho94> BRO
[3:27:33] <Zaphire_Saucypants> probably the best "final" position is for those two cars to be at the top, but ya gotta start at the bottom. A mite tricky, dis one.
[3:27:34] <%vectorless_peon> you almost had it the first time apatBig apatFist apatFist
[3:27:35] <nostalgia_junkie_music> anyone else doing the leg tap
[3:27:37] <%Edgy_Macaroon> move the long ones right bottom
[3:27:38] <+exploitativity2> @thewisewolf are you SURE you've figured it out? do you know all the rules to the movement? if you were to try it, I'd bet you'd have a hard time
[3:27:42] <Derkinstacker> Go the 3 length wise cars into the botom right corner
[3:27:50] <OldManDeckardCain> Pat almost had it at the start LUL
[3:27:52] <+ProtagonistJake> thats the do it
[3:27:55] <jubejube56> Could probably do a montage with of saying “fuck” to this puzzle
[3:27:57] <+AngriestAngryArtist> YEAH YEAH YEAH!
[3:27:58] <%King_Wolf_Rigger> Got some boppin' tunes goin on
[3:28:00] <Derkinstacker> you got it now
[3:28:05] <%Nope80808> ima bout to go through this mission and dm this fool the solution
[3:28:06] <VJdarkworld> Baba is legion
[3:28:08] <waifoong98> So close
[3:28:12] <%MrCalieb> doing more of sitting sway
[3:28:12] <%vectorless_peon> is okay pat we love you even if you cand to slider puzzels well
[3:28:13] <%dalmek> Chat do you HAVE to recall the legion after doing a push? Could you just leave him in a closed off space?
[3:28:15] <%TDotGoat> Pat Swears at Astral Chain!
[3:28:20] <Derkinstacker> dont bring those in yet.
[3:28:25] <+exploitativity2> deciding whether or not to recall is part of the strategy
[3:28:26] <%MrCalieb> im cranking it up to a bop
[3:28:29] <%Big_Dream> nope
[3:28:30] <+exploitativity2> recalling can lock you
[3:28:33] <xinexes> BUS
[3:28:38] <mostundesired> NotLikeThis
[3:28:38] <%dalmek> I think Pat's doing too much recalling then
[3:28:39] <UnfilteredComic> HOW CAN
[3:28:41] <+Felto3> pull out the little cars, move top right down
[3:28:43] <%MrCalieb> baba is bus
[3:28:44] <xinexes> NO BUs
[3:28:45] <%Edgy_Macaroon> no only long ones on right
[3:28:48] <+exploitativity2> at least, you can always undo an action if you don't recall
[3:28:48] <VJdarkworld> But baba tho
[3:28:49] <deviljhojho94> THIS BE
[3:28:49] <Zaphire_Saucypants> yeah, you need to clear the vans first.
[3:28:50] <MasterDecoder> Oh god, he's becoming Paige
[3:28:53] <%vectorless_peon> Pat bus goes on the LEFT side
[3:28:55] <xinexes> yay
[3:28:56] <+exploitativity2> once you recall sometimes that makes it undoable
[3:29:02] <deviljhojho94> I wish paige was here to see this FeelsBadMan
[3:29:03] <bendatron> pat
[3:29:04] <%goose_attack_almanac> oh god the feeling of Backseating is rising up
[3:29:05] <waifoong98> Put white care horizontal then move it vertical later Pat
[3:29:08] <Captain_Aham> you okay buddy?
[3:29:11] <+exploitativity2> DON'T
[3:29:18] <Strider222> oh no
[3:29:22] <Derkinstacker> Reset
[3:29:23] <waifoong98> *whitecar
[3:29:25] <%d00msdaydan> aaaaand softlocked
[3:29:26] <%goose_attack_almanac> Move white care
[3:29:28] <%Piemen99> Jesus pat
[3:29:28] <+exploitativity2> wait no it's fine
[3:29:29] <%BestTeaMaker> gamerpose time
[3:29:31] <+exploitativity2> ohh nooo
[3:29:32] <%joylent_blue> NotLikeThis my brain
[3:29:33] <+NeonBleu> we stuck, bois
[3:29:33] <bendatron> 2 white cars on the bottom
[3:29:34] <waifoong98> DAMN IT
[3:29:34] <%MrCalieb> yeah would paige be getting some satisfaction outta this
[3:29:36] <TioXyco> I think pat's brain is kinda overheating
[3:29:37] <+hazzy_o7> LUL
[3:29:41] <+BoomerTiro> We are watching a man die, one grid square at a time
[3:29:41] <+exploitativity2> you could've move the white around and still gotten yourself out
[3:29:42] <%Nope80808> Pat those 3 black horizonal vans need to be at the bottom pat
[3:29:42] <+ProtagonistJake> keep the yellow cars for last
[3:29:43] <xinexes> so close
[3:29:44] <%BestTeaMaker> move the 3 horizontal cars to the bottom right
[3:29:44] <DeebzNutz100> so close
[3:29:45] <Derkinstacker> Pat, leave the little cars out, move the 3 length wise cars to the bottom right.
[3:29:46] <%JusTTheGuyYouNeed> we live here now
[3:29:46] <+HyperCharge_Sam> little cars go on top right side
[3:29:47] <%Edgy_Macaroon> move sideways vans to the bottom right
[3:29:57] <VJdarkworld> But baba ceases to be
[3:29:57] <deviljhojho94> Just win 4Head
[3:29:58] <ne0bunny> I struggled on this one too
[3:29:58] <%dalmek> @AngriestPat don't recall your legion so often, you screw yourself out of options that way
[3:30:01] <%d00msdaydan> just fucking smash them all up with your legion
[3:30:03] <%DeathsDoom> you can abort to reset time btw
[3:30:03] <%supersugoisenpai1> Horizontal vans must go on the right, and bus has to be on the left
[3:30:03] <sonicluigi123> 0_____0
[3:30:04] <%vectorless_peon> we know pat we know
[3:30:05] <%Big_Dream> pat put the too tinys cars next to each-other instead of a line thats where your getting yourself stuck
[3:30:06] <hassanico1> Twelve minutes folks. Twelve.
[3:30:12] <%Niney_Who> How can this beeee
[3:30:12] <sonicluigi123> HES STILL GOING?!
[3:30:16] <TheLaw3D4> No they're fun
[3:30:17] <valriot> Brain go down
[3:30:22] <+exploitativity2> hey man I spent like 40 minutes on this
[3:30:24] <waifoong98> it is Portal all over again...
[3:30:27] <Strider222> i did this in 30 seconds LUL
[3:30:30] <+hazzy_o7> these ones suck cause you can screw up by recalling legion and stuff. kinda dumb
[3:30:32] <VJdarkworld> I had fun with these puzzles :)
[3:30:34] <+Darren716> So stream of the RE4 block puzzle next time.
[3:30:37] <%Keyd00d> I did this in 5 seconds
[3:30:38] <+Darren716> ?
[3:30:38] <tequilazaku> Big bus needs to be parked on the left by the end
[3:30:39] <hassanico1> jesus crhist this is so easy...
[3:30:40] <%Nope80808> YES YES YES YES!
[3:30:43] <%Keyd00d> maybe it was 3
[3:30:44] <+Felto3> nooooo
[3:30:48] <LegendCobra> i couldnt do this one and gave up
[3:30:52] <WRFWD> No Pat, vans first, cars later
[3:30:53] <%BestTeaMaker> nooooo
[3:30:54] <Zaphire_Saucypants> too early Pat
[3:30:54] <+McSnazzyPants> i actually like that they play around with keeping your legion out vs recalling it for moves to work
[3:30:55] <Derkinstacker> pat stop
[3:30:58] <Derkinstacker> put it back
[3:30:59] <%dekkitout> Not being able to push/pull from any side is infuriating
[3:31:02] <%Niney_Who> MAXIMUM STUMB
[3:31:04] <%Edgy_Macaroon> no only vans on right side
[3:31:06] <%BestTeaMaker> put the yellow cars back
[3:31:08] <+exploitativity2> nothing like half of chat talking about how easy it is the other half talking about how they gave up or took a long time
[3:31:09] <MasterDecoder> VANS FIRST
[3:31:10] <Kongro_> oh hello
[3:31:13] <+VektorTroika> STUMBO LEGION
[3:31:14] <Derkinstacker> move that top car to the right.
[3:31:19] <Zaphire_Saucypants> slam dem vans out of the park
[3:31:20] <WRFWD> Leave the cars at the center Pat, you need the space
[3:31:21] <Captain_Joe1911> Go Pat! BloodTrail heart2Kigom
[3:31:21] <%MrCalieb> cheer100
[3:31:23] <+McSnazzyPants> he's close
[3:31:24] <%Edgy_Macaroon> move the car
[3:31:24] <TheLaw3D4> @Edgy_Macaroon There are several ways to solve
[3:31:29] <lols_royce> turn you main finger, topwise
[3:31:30] <Kongro_> oh he's here, i guess this is where the playthrough stops I guess
[3:31:31] <+PopeT3> this is magical
[3:31:32] <mostundesired> So, uh, isn't the top van supposed to go to the bottom?
[3:31:33] <Zaphire_Saucypants> ya see it, Pat?
[3:31:37] <Strider222> just get in the car and drive away
[3:31:38] <Zaphire_Saucypants> I think he sees it.
[3:31:38] <%Nope80808> YES NOW SMALL WHITE OUT AND MOVE VAN DOWN
[3:31:39] <sonicluigi123> 0_0

[3:32:18] <mostundesired> NotLikeThis
[3:32:20] <Zaphire_Saucypants> you want the two cars at the TOP, vertically.

[3:32:52] <%Niney_Who> LUL
[3:32:53] <%kyh9> Close
[3:32:53] <Zaphire_Saucypants> basically putting the cars in last after you've settled the vans.
[3:32:54] <%kyh9> So close
[3:32:55] <rempai1> the bus goes left?
[3:32:55] <vexion_smh> Stay in the empty slot on the right
[3:32:57] <%Nope80808> SWAP THE WHITE CARES
[3:33:00] <OldManDeckardCain> CAN'T WAKE UP
[3:33:01] <%Nope80808> WITH THE TOP ONE
[3:33:01] <%Edgy_Macaroon> move the sideways one down more
[3:33:01] <%TDotGoat> just move the vehicles, Pat
[3:33:03] <%joylent_blue> i think the problem is with the placement of the small cars
[3:33:04] <+exploitativity2> OHHHH
[3:33:09] <Kongro_> pushing, thinking
[3:33:12] <Derkinstacker> circles
[3:33:13] <%mister___doctor> You got this Paige
[3:33:20] <waifoong98> THIS IS IT
[3:33:21] <%decisivelynameless> This one took me over an hour
[3:33:21] <+McSnazzyPants> that recall fucked it
[3:33:22] <+AngriestAngryArtist> he got it
[3:33:23] <Derkinstacker> Same problem.
[3:33:25] <%MrCalieb> come on paige!
[3:33:26] <%joylent_blue> same problem

[3:33:32] <Derkinstacker> PAT
[3:33:35] <mostundesired> ?????
[3:33:39] <TheLaw3D4> HE could have done it if he kept legion out
[3:33:40] <sonicluigi123> 0_0
[3:33:44] <%BestTeaMaker> you were so close
[3:33:45] <%dalmek> @AngriestPat if you didn't recall the legion from the other side of the bus you would've solved it
[3:33:46] <mostundesired> What are you even doing at this point?
[3:33:48] <%Edgy_Macaroon> move top right down
[3:33:50] <Zaphire_Saucypants> remove the cars, Pat
[3:33:58] <Derkinstacker> Pat you're like 1 step off, then you start moving the little cars in, take them out.
[3:34:01] <MasterDecoder> @AngriestPat come. on. Pat.
[3:34:02] <%kyh9> lewdf
[3:34:02] <Charlie_Decker> what is Akira thinking while watching this
[3:34:05] <%Nope80808> ONCE YOU SWAP THE CARS WITH THAT HORIZONAL ONE AT THE TOP YOU CAN SLIDE THE VERITCAL ONE IN THE TOP LEFT IN AND MOVE THE BUS IN THOSE SPOTS
[3:34:08] <Strider222> do you know who ate all the donuts?
[3:34:24] <+rorschachsjournal505> To be fair it took me a while. But I suck at puzzles
[3:34:24] <+exploitativity2> you can't be seirous
[3:34:25] <%MrCalieb> i dont drive but im sixty percent sure this isnt how you would go about parking your car
[3:34:26] <VJdarkworld> Someones gonna need to send all this to paige, baba’s revenge

[3:34:47] <PrimeNeverproc> he had it
[3:34:48] <HisEvilDomain> you need a T shape to get the Tetris, then we can erase the big one
[3:34:49] <+exploitativity2> WHERE YOU GONNA PUT THE BUS
[3:34:51] <sonicluigi123> I don't know what the solution is but THAT doesn't looks right
[3:34:52] <waifoong98> Baba is Mad
[3:34:53] <Zaphire_Saucypants> yeah no, Pat. Only Bus can go there
[3:34:55] <+rorschachsjournal505> Jesus Christ
[3:34:56] <+Darren716> That clock isn't accurate right? Right?!
[3:34:58] <OldManDeckardCain> WRONG ORDER
[3:34:58] <tequilazaku> STTTTTTTOOOOOOOOOOOOOPPP
[3:34:59] <Derkinstacker> RESET

[3:35:02] <xinexes> nooo
[3:35:02] <Zaphire_Saucypants> Bus is last
[3:35:04] <mostundesired> NotLikeThis
[3:35:05] <KingKZ> His brain has given up.

[3:35:09] <vexion_smh> WHY RESET
[3:35:09] <%MrCalieb> this music gets better and better
[3:35:10] <%umbypokochan> it's official, paige has infected pat with her mustard gas
[3:35:10] <%13ry4n93> is this worse or better than the time with paige and re7?
[3:35:10] <Derkinstacker> 3 length cars bottom right.
[3:35:10] <CrypticMochi> brownSPOOKY
[3:35:12] <nostalgia_junkie_music> im
[3:35:14] <+RichAnvils> bruh i feel you
[3:35:14] <Kongro_> How long has he been here?
[3:35:14] <Derkinstacker> dont move little cars in
[3:35:14] <%MrCalieb> i especially like this bit
[3:35:14] <%meraud> NotLikeThis
[3:35:16] <nostalgia_junkie_music> im leave
[3:35:17] <+kraajkase> take a break Pat lol
[3:35:18] <+parrotman01> I like this song
[3:35:20] <%VanaSkiller> 0 plan
[3:35:21] <artificiallynatural> you were almost there
[3:35:21] <%Nope80808> PAt no BOTH WHITE CARS NEED TO BE AT THE TOP RIGHT VERTICALLY STACKED
[3:35:22] <+theotherkristian> i have spent over 25 hours on this game, at least 1 was spent on this puzzle
[3:35:23] <%Big_Dream> logic
[3:35:23] <Derkinstacker> 3 length cars bottom right
[3:35:24] <+Muzzle131> Why are you so foolish
[3:35:24] <%goose_attack_almanac> Push the top white car to the left
[3:35:26] <+exploitativity2> this puzzle is way harder than the stupid shadow puzzle
[3:35:26] <%mister___doctor> I'm gonna hear this music in my nightmares
[3:35:28] <Derkinstacker> Im telling you what to do.
[3:35:29] <%Edgy_Macaroon> move the vans down
[3:35:29] <+parrotman01> Take a breather man. You were really close
[3:35:31] <+Darren716> Paige is worse because this is legit challenging unlike the shadow puzzle
[3:35:32] <%Niney_Who> This is the best
[3:35:33] <%Big_Dream> its a grid
[3:35:34] <tequilazaku> fYOU WERE LIKE TWO MOVES AWAY FROM SOLVING IT HOLY SHIT
[3:35:35] <%joylent_blue> Nope80808 stop with the all caps BabyRage
[3:35:35] <%Keyd00d> I don't blame Pat at all
[3:35:35] <%Divryne> The real slide puzzles were the cars we pushed along the way.
[3:35:36] <+ProtagonistJake> use your gut fuck it
[3:35:36] <%Niney_Who> "HOW CAN THIS BE"
[3:35:37] <+BoomerTiro> God damn this is like having my dick pulled by someone who is suboptimal at it!
[3:35:40] <+McSnazzyPants> BUT IT'S A GRID PAT YOU LOVE IT
[3:35:40] <+hazzy_o7> can just come back to them later
[3:35:40] <%DeathsDoom> GRIDS
[3:35:40] <yendoria> 18 minutes
[3:35:42] <%supersugoisenpai1> horizontal vans on right, bus on left
[3:35:42] <%MrCalieb> nearly twenty minutes uh oh
[3:35:43] <Onmi_Khaos> "I don't know what my plan is" is the most Pat Comment I've ever heard
[3:35:43] <TheLaw3D4> Let's just skip
[3:35:44] <+kraajkase> BUT BABA THO
[3:35:44] <Derkinstacker> Just do 3 length wise cars in the bottom right.
[3:35:45] <PrimeNeverproc> pat, 3 horizontal vans at bottom right
[3:35:45] <Zaphire_Saucypants> It's finally, basically it's a slow process of moving the cars, first to the bottom vertically, then to the very top, AFTER you move that top left most vertical van over to the very right.
[3:35:46] <%doc_ock_rokc> @AngriestPat Attache case
[3:35:49] <%vectorless_peon> pat get all the buss on the left all others and one vertical van on the left
[3:35:49] <%BestTeaMaker> lol
[3:35:50] <liflamor> I LOVE slide puzzles
[3:35:53] <%Big_Dream> brute force
[3:35:54] <VJdarkworld> Dont skip, feel the baba
[3:35:55] <%dalmek> the true brute smarts
[3:35:57] <waifoong98> Brute smurt
[3:35:58] <yendoria> It took me like 25...
[3:36:01] <%dekkitout> Brute force it?
[3:36:02] <+theotherkristian> This is were the Mixer "let audience take over controller" may be useful
[3:36:03] <+Felto3> cars at the top
[3:36:04] <%spacehouse> So trial and error thinking
[3:36:06] <HisEvilDomain> what can we do to help his mind goblins? We already have a grid....
[3:36:06] <+VektorTroika> naw you'd get frustrated with it and throw it in the bin with the rubix cube
[3:36:08] <SlimeSlimeSlime> It's different when you can do it with your hands, yeah.
[3:36:08] <%DeathsDoom> RUBIX CUBE IT
[3:36:09] <jubejube56> Stumble on a solution?
[3:36:09] <%BestTeaMaker> all horizontal cars on the bottom
[3:36:13] <%Edgy_Macaroon> move vans to the right
[3:36:14] <%doc_ock_rokc> @AngriestPat Attache case put like minded items together
[3:36:14] <%MrCalieb> attache case hd is the best puzzle
[3:36:16] <SolidusA> Slide puzzle is like a train you driving empty space
[3:36:16] <%Keyd00d> this is NOT attache case lmao
[3:36:23] <+CharredChord> Oh God it's still happening
[3:36:25] <+Andrizzleton> most of the puzzle revolves around your legion being in an area that your character is NOT
[3:36:26] <waifoong98> Trapped again...
[3:36:28] <Onmi_Khaos> So what's the goal with this puzzle?
[3:36:30] <Floofiie> LUL
[3:36:30] <%joylent_blue> Attache Case Hardcore
[3:36:32] <%supersugoisenpai1> This is the hypest stream
[3:36:35] <Hollowknight45> so you would be guessing
[3:36:37] <+HyperCharge_Sam> keep the little cars vertically next to the bus so you can move the horizontal vans to the bottem right
[3:36:37] <Onmi_Khaos> Get the white cars as the only ones on the road?
[3:36:40] <@commanderclaw> Attache Case (EX)
[3:36:40] <%MrCalieb> no matter how many times i play through re4 it'll never not be satisfying to organise that case

[3:42:48] <WRFWD> Don't worry Pat, I was stuck there for 2 hours, I don't know how I did it
[3:42:48] <%umbypokochan> there is no logic, it's all visualization
[3:42:50] <%marsanta> You need to think three/four steps ahead based on the rules
[3:42:50] <TCCBros> you did great!
[3:42:51] <%Shadicara> Neverf change pat LUL
[3:42:51] <%doc_ock_rokc> You need to think in 3 steps

[3:43:05] <Derkinstacker> there went turbo lappy.
[3:43:05] <+VektorTroika> Mach Speed Lappy
[3:43:06] <al0nem0nster> it's the same part of the brain that deals with those slidy puzzles I'd recon.
[3:43:06] <%Engwithan_Elder_God> What is Lappy doing?
[3:43:06] <TheLaw3D4> You just gotta plan ahead and keep the rules in mind
[3:43:06] <Zaphire_Saucypants> you did a good job through brute smarts, Pat
[3:43:07] <%arancet> gotta think steps ahead and keep in mind your move limitations, that said this puzzle sucks ass
[3:43:08] <indig0bird> Running Lappy!
[3:43:08] <VJdarkworld> LAPPY
[3:43:08] <+CharredChord> Lappy is so fucking fast holy shit
[3:43:08] <%Dr_DangerPhD> You can only push pull from the side you're own, if you remember that the logic is straightforward
[3:43:09] <TioXyco> LAPPY COMEBACK
[3:43:09] <%100percentcanadianbeef> learn mechanics of puzzle
[3:43:09] <tequilazaku> wtf
[3:43:09] <%mister___doctor> Go fuck yourself Jin
[3:43:10] <Kongro_> ITS A PUZZLE
[3:43:10] <Strider222> LAPPY QUIZ
[3:43:11] <Hollowknight45> lappy run past you
[3:43:12] <+ProtagonistJake> You think ahead have to move shit out of the way but not put it in a finalized spot yet
[3:43:13] <mostundesired> CAN YOU?
[3:43:16] <%Louie_Salmon> And then you work backwards
[3:43:17] <%Niney_Who> CAN YOU?
[3:43:18] <+CharredChord> Running in the Lappy
[3:43:18] <Zaphire_Saucypants> It's the journey that fucks with you, dude.
[3:43:19] <etalmeta> you have to visualize how they move as well
[3:43:21] <%Keyd00d> Jin didn't want to do it
[3:43:22] <rempai1> BIG BRAIN
[3:43:22] <MasterDecoder> STEP BY STEP
[3:43:22] <+BoomerTiro> Internally, the logic is sound. Applied to this game it's BS because you shopuld be able to do that WAY easier.
[3:43:23] <+MazDoThing> @AngriestPat You have to remember that your Stand and You take up tiles yourself
[3:43:23] <%goose_attack_almanac> Marianne hauling ass. The force of her yabbos flapping causing the hurricane
[3:43:24] <+nekodelic> It's like chess
[3:43:24] <koolaid_kevster> boy @angriestpat peach has really rubbed off on you huh
[3:43:25] <%filialpails> WITH YOUR BRAIN
[3:43:25] <%MrCalieb> the journey is what counts
[3:43:26] <+kraajkase> Its a puzzle what do you expect?
[3:43:26] <Ipsenscastle> It's a grid, Pat
[3:43:26] <%Niney_Who> WORK IT OUT
[3:43:27] <al0nem0nster> Like chess you're supposed to think several moves ahead pat and visualize all of them.
[3:43:28] <%BestTeaMaker> @AngriestPat the best way is to think about what space the pieces occupy, and where the best places to put them is
[3:43:28] <%Edgy_Macaroon> you need a plan before you start
[3:43:28] <skinmansgds> BRUTE LOGIC
[3:43:30] <+exploitativity2> @AngriestPat 1. You can only pull back and forth from the side you're grabbing. 2. You can only pull into spaces where you and your legion are not.
[3:43:31] <PrimeNeverproc> liar. you didnt know 3 vans bottom
[3:43:32] <%aeravon> The end of the puzzle is less relevant. you have to obey the movement rules
[3:43:33] <Strider222> you missed lappy :(
[3:43:33] <%doc_ock_rokc> Okay you know how the end goes...work backwards from that
[3:43:33] <Onmi_Khaos> You have to remember that YOU occupy a space
[3:43:34] <%Keyd00d> I dunno lol I looked it up
[3:43:34] <etalmeta> like moving chess pieces, they move in specific ways
[3:43:35] <+AngriestAngryArtist> the inbetween is visualizing how each one move into their place. Yeah it's hard as fuck but you did it!
[3:43:35] <%Keyd00d> fuck it
[3:43:36] <%Nope80808> You need to work at a warehouse man
[3:43:36] <%Engwithan_Elder_God> It's just something you have to visualize each step.
[3:43:37] <%spacehouse> USE GRID LOGIC
[3:43:37] <Onmi_Khaos> Even when you dont' technically do it
[3:43:39] <%MrCalieb> and all the friends you make along the way of course
[3:43:40] <%Big_Dream> problem solving skills and critical thinking
[3:43:40] <%Niney_Who> You can NEVER Bully Paige about Puzzles again
[3:43:41] <%umbypokochan> i guess it's different when your character isn't in the way
[3:43:41] <%Shadicara> Are you a very technical minded person pat?
[3:43:41] <%marsanta> Visualize how it CAN move, like chess
[3:43:41] <%Dakuu75> well, this puzzel had different rules because of the astral chain mechanics and shit
[3:43:44] <Zaphire_Saucypants> don't worry, Lappy runs all over the damn place.
[3:43:44] <%d00msdaydan> please move on
[3:43:45] <powerprotoman> its tetris pat
[3:43:46] <PrimeNeverproc> move on then
[3:43:47] <rempai1> SMASH SMOrc
[3:43:48] <Onmi_Khaos> You can't pull back where you'd crush yourself into a car
[3:43:48] <%Niney_Who> Pat, WALL
[3:43:50] <HisEvilDomain> Baba is you, baba is car, baba is demon-thing. Baba cannot into Baba.
[3:43:50] <%DeathsDoom> BABA
[3:43:50] <eanscrale> did someone say GRD?
[3:43:50] <mayorrev> where's Lappy?
[3:43:52] <TCCBros> I am proud of you
[3:43:54] <%dekkitout> It's more about leaving a single space for yourself to use as a pivot
[3:43:54] <%goose_attack_almanac> It's weird spacial awareness puzzles
[3:43:57] <Derkinstacker> Nope
[3:43:57] <Valdorick> If you can see the ending, just work backwards from there 4Head
[3:43:58] <Tucker0603> BABA
[3:43:58] <%MrCalieb> BOX
[3:43:59] <+hazzy_o7> LUL
[3:43:59] <%Shadicara> Never work in a warehouse LUL
[3:44:01] <bleugh> this seems like a bigger game than most platinum thngs?
[3:44:01] <%Niney_Who> LUL
[3:44:02] <%Edgy_Macaroon> it's fine whats important is its done
[3:44:02] <%Dementedpenguin> What.
[3:44:02] <%kyh9> It;s a really shitty puzzle
[3:44:03] <%marsanta> CHESS
[3:44:03] <MasterDecoder> NOT IF THERE HAS TO BE A PATTERN
[3:44:05] <Zaphire_Saucypants> She's pulling a Flash, that's what.
[3:44:05] <Idon__> but if BAAABAAAA
[3:44:05] <%umbypokochan> not with a forklift
[3:44:05] <+ProtagonistJake> Manage a warehouse Pat
[3:44:06] <%XzileGaming> you have to have an ability to reverse engineer it in your head... if u dont have that its fine
[3:44:06] <mayorrev> BUT BABA
[3:44:07] <%MrCalieb> BABA IS ALWAYS BOX
[3:44:08] <MasterDecoder> Ugh
[3:44:09] <%mister___doctor> apatWhat
[3:44:10] <%Niney_Who> That's not how it works in a warehouse
[3:44:10] <pi_in_the_sci> WHERE IS THE SPACE FOR THE FORKLIFT
[3:44:11] <Derkinstacker> You have spent too much time with paige.
[3:44:11] <mostundesired> Pat confirmed never worked in any storage
[3:44:12] <Lunatyr_> Baba is box
[3:44:12] <+kraajkase> BABA IS WALL
[3:44:15] <+nekodelic> chess logic: know what you want to do, think about each step on how to do it @AngriestPat
[3:44:16] <%kyh9> It's just a bad puzzle, I promise you that. It's actually frustrating
[3:44:16] <%doc_ock_rokc> God I mgiht have to go back to work at a wearhouse
[3:44:17] <%VantomPayne> its just Klotski, its can be solved by math but its easier for most to just move around and visualize the steps
[3:44:19] <+ProtagonistJake> Thats not what this is
[3:44:21] <mayorrev> BAAAAAAba
[3:44:22] <%Keyd00d> just do it right the first time
[3:44:23] <+rorschachsjournal505> That’s not how that works in a storage
[3:44:23] <%BlueMoonBlues> You dont have noclip in real life Pat
[3:44:26] <%King_Wolf_Rigger> You're not gonna get the answer you need from chat, Pat.
[3:44:27] <waifoong98> Why would one work in a warehouse, rmb that German Forklift LUL
[3:44:29] <%Futurecity10> slide puzzles are fucking bullshit
[3:44:29] <%ThatOneGameTester> stock isn't the same as warehouse chess
[3:44:30] <%XzileGaming> reverse engineering.
[3:44:31] <Ipsenscastle> The trick is not to crush yourself with a bus
[3:44:33] <%dalmek> Well there's your problem
[3:44:34] <%MrCalieb> apatWhat apatSkelmo
[3:44:35] <powerprotoman> yeah and you suck at chess
[3:44:35] <+JacktheMan18> You need to figure out the rules of how moving the cars work before you visualize how you work the problem
[3:44:35] <VJdarkworld> Pat should play wilmot’s warehouse
[3:44:36] <%dekkitout> You can also CLIMB OVER stuff irl
[3:44:37] <%Niney_Who> LUL
[3:44:38] <%BestTeaMaker> well, that's a problem then

[3:44:41] <+JacktheMan18> Oh there's the problem then
[3:44:42] <al0nem0nster> and that's why you're not a competetive chess player.

[3:44:47] <%Dakuu75> @AngriestPat you're not gonna get a useful answer from Chat, bro.
[3:44:50] <%mister___doctor> I guess you could say that puzzle was an Astral Pain huh.
[3:44:50] <TheLaw3D4> Stop doing that and do the other thing then
[3:44:50] <TCCBros> you just gotta do it like a sandwitch
[3:44:51] <Nekros4442> can't do that if there's more shit in the way though....you need space
[3:44:52] <startstoprepeat> why are you trying to explain anything to this poor broken brain
[3:44:53] <al0nem0nster> you have more than 2 dimensions in real life.
[3:44:53] <Zaphire_Saucypants> just say trial and error and move along, Pat.
[3:44:54] <%doc_ock_rokc> Pat Think Forklift

[3:45:07] <+nekodelic> It's Shenmue
[3:45:07] <+AngriestAngryArtist> big ass warehouses need to do shit like this, no joke LOL
[3:45:08] <%Louie_Salmon> But what if something else is against the wall Pat
[3:45:08] <%Zael913> I understood the puzzle with the idea that you can only push/pull. And you are working with the grid.
[3:45:09] <starlitalpha> chat thinks people can only push and pull in real life i guess
[3:45:09] <+ProtagonistJake> Pat I
[3:45:10] <mayorrev> WHAT IS THIS ATGUMENT WE'RE HAVING
[3:45:11] <vaderxyz1970> not for 10 ton transformers
[3:45:11] <%Edgy_Macaroon> thsts the problem you need to have a idea of what you want. it's trial and error
[3:45:13] <jubejube56> Do you pull a box against a wall pat?
[3:45:13] <%MrCalieb> this is hilarious
[3:45:13] <+exploitativity2> basically it was square wise and you can only move within a square. the free movement of this game made it misleading
[3:45:14] <+Caped_Eggy> If you are talking about small boxes, sure
[3:45:15] <%marsanta> Pat cannot into procedural logic
[3:45:15] <MasterDecoder> JUST CONTINUE THE GAME

[3:45:18] <%Shadicara> Chat goblins
[3:45:18] <Kongro_> Are you trying to say you're thinking with REAL logic and not GAME logic Pat?
[3:45:19] <+rorschachsjournal505> Ok we in the troll zone now
[3:45:21] <%dekkitout> Aren't there forklifts that can move perpendicularly

[3:45:27] <%Niney_Who> Boxes big and heavy
[3:45:27] <+trebassstream> WHY DO YOU NEED A FORKLIFT TO MOVE BOXES???
[3:45:28] <%BlueMoonBlues> I think we've gone off the rails

[3:46:35] <%XzileGaming> puzzle is fine, if youre not a goblin head
[3:46:35] <%Edgy_Macaroon> trial and error you learn from mistakes
[3:46:35] <+exploitativity2> this is WAY harder than shadow puzzle
[3:46:36] <+JacktheMan18> You can't brute force solve every puzzle LUL
[3:46:36] <%MrCalieb> yeeyeeyee
[3:46:36] <+hazzy_o7> She's giving ppl balloons
[3:46:37] <%ThatOneGameTester> Stumbo has entered the building
[3:46:37] <Kongro_> the real puzzle is Pat amirite chat
[3:46:37] <Zaphire_Saucypants> she's going around handing balloons to people.
[3:46:39] <%umbypokochan> it's one of those things that as soon as it clicks you'd be like "ohhhhhhh"
[3:46:40] <%mister___doctor> @dekkitout Why do you think his name is Lappy
[3:46:44] <%Niney_Who> Jesus christ pat
[3:46:44] <waifoong98> wow...
[3:46:47] <+Darren716> Pat that is the easiest puzzle ever
[3:46:47] <%Dementedpenguin> o_O
[3:46:48] <%dekkitout> Fair point
[3:46:51] <%MrCalieb> i remember it you should do all the ones on the outside
[3:46:53] <skinmansgds> The real slide puzzle was the S= we got along the way
[3:46:54] <%spacehouse> holy shit
[3:46:54] <gustavozxd> my cousin did that puzzle for me
[3:46:55] <%Gohyakuen> that's really sad
[3:46:57] <Aydarkzero> wait... the slide puzzle in the knight room?
[3:46:57] <+Darren716> you can solve that in 5 seconds
[3:46:58] <%marsanta> The best one was in the Barkley LP
[3:47:00] <+HyperCharge_Sam> that puzzle is super easy by default too
[3:47:04] <@SSaryn> Ok to be fair, Sliding puzzles are either the easiest or the worst. And it's usually the fucking worst.
[3:47:06] <+ProtagonistJake> Pat think of it like everything taking turns getting to its proper place. Some shit just has to get out of the way first until its their turn
[3:47:09] <+theotherkristian> Did he get the ghost quest
[3:47:11] <+parrotman01> that puzzle is the easiest one
[3:47:15] <%VantomPayne> apatGoblin apatGoblin apatGoblin apatGoblin
[3:47:16] <%Shadicara> That's some hard mind goblins there
[3:47:16] <Valdorick> Pat is 99 emotion, 1 logic...
[3:47:16] <%ThatOneGameTester> I am also this way
[3:47:22] <+exploitativity2> it WASN'T easy
[3:47:23] <+Darren716> Pat literally just slide the outside, it's something a 4 year old could do
[3:47:23] <+hazzy_o7> It's not easy
[3:47:24] <%Niney_Who> I grew up playing Humongous games so I'm good at Sllding Puzzles
[3:47:24] <hassanico1> ...that's just dumb...
[3:47:26] <%MrCalieb> yeah puzzles that let yourself bone yourself over hurts me
[3:47:27] <vinceshamwowslap> But that puzzle was easy I'm not kidding
[3:47:29] <%ElenaManetta> You're so lucky video games are your JOB and you have the time to do something over and over again
[3:47:29] <al0nem0nster> oh right the old "I know one way to solve a rubix cube so if it's messed up I can't find it. Rather than "i use da algorithm."
[3:47:29] <Idon__> You can reset the cars though
[3:47:32] <WRFWD> It's not easy Pat
[3:47:33] <%dekkitout> Back in Pokemon Soul Silver, I just used Action Replay to noClip the ice puzzles
[3:47:35] <%XzileGaming> that puzzle is easy unless youre a goblin
[3:47:35] <Onmi_Khaos> Pat you talking about sliding puzzles, is the same face the guy makes in the Steel vs Feathers video
[3:47:37] <%DeathsDoom> NOT EASY
[3:47:39] <+Matto424> I mean that puzzle is one of the hardest parts of the game
[3:47:41] <Kongro_> ... You can reset it
[3:47:42] <Aydarkzero> i just moved it over in the same direction LUL
[3:47:43] <corepercentlives> just do it perfectly the first time :/

[3:47:59] <%doc_ock_rokc> Its hard to describe the thought process thatgoes into it but its spacial management
[3:48:01] <+theotherkristian> Where the ghost puzzle

[3:48:02] <%kyh9> In Astral Chain, you can reset those car puzzles

[3:51:58] <waifoong98> is this cop abusing power Kappa
[3:51:58] <@SSaryn> Wow. This really shows how lenient the hitboxes for the arrows are.
[3:52:04] <skinmansgds> There's a pretty good bonus for doing these from the hip only, a couple thousand more points
[3:52:07] <al0nem0nster> what does this look like in regular speed?
[3:52:12] <%Shadicara> Hard
[3:52:14] <al0nem0nster> just a rapid fire sniper shots.
[3:52:18] <%Shadicara> Actually challenging
[3:52:19] <Idon__> damn these arrows are huge
[3:52:22] <Idon__> NOOOOO
[3:52:23] <al0nem0nster> or is this guy just seeing Pat wave his arms and all of the targets explode.

[3:52:40] <Idon__> YEEEEEEEEEAH
[3:52:41] <%BestTeaMaker> BIG BRAIN
[3:52:42] <al0nem0nster> it's just magic arm waving
[3:52:48] <%dalmek> it might just look like he's pointing and the targets disappear
[3:52:50] <Idon__> resist the monkey brain
[3:52:51] <Zaphire_Saucypants> grats
[3:52:52] <%Shadicara> STILL GOT S+

[3:53:03] <%doc_ock_rokc> Didn't joey try to kill us a few chapters ago
[3:53:06] <Hollowknight45> you miss lappy
[3:53:10] <+HyperCharge_Sam> If you catch Lappy, you can do a hidden blue case
[3:53:17] <%Dakuu75> why is her chain red?
[3:53:18] <%Shadicara> Catch the crime dog pat
[3:53:22] <TheLaw3D4> @doc_ock_rokc Not at all?
[3:53:24] <UnfilteredComic> Like youuuu
[3:53:28] <Onmi_Khaos> This feels like our Cole Phelps Arson Desk moment
[3:53:28] <bleugh> LUL
[3:53:29] <+kraajkase> @Sphincter_Spelunker it's a cooldown file
[3:53:31] <%Shadicara> So is your sister evil red cop now?
[3:53:31] <OldManDeckardCain> this file is just a kingdom hearts game LUL
[3:53:31] <%dekkitout> Because she's Red Cop
[3:53:34] <%marsanta> No, you just don't know how to do them
[3:53:38] <PrimeNeverproc> yea yea, suuuuper togh
[3:53:38] <%Nope80808> @doc_ock_rokc He wasnt tryna kill you he was tryna bring you back in.
[3:53:39] <%doc_ock_rokc> @AngriestPat Actually pat that is accurate
[3:53:39] <al0nem0nster> So catching lappy gives a secret case someone said?
[3:53:39] <Onmi_Khaos> Except I don't know what we did to get us Arson'd

[3:53:49] <skinmansgds> "Resident Evil puzzles are for babies! Oh shit"
[3:53:49] <%Jeemukun> anyway, lost power for like two hours, what I miss
[3:53:52] <%Edgy_Macaroon> children think differently than us
[3:53:54] <+VektorTroika> I remember there being a toy version of this exact puzzle around the turn of the century
[3:53:54] <%Louie_Salmon> Yeah, everyone finds them tough, you're not just a child or anything
[3:53:55] <waifoong98> So you are admitting losing to children? Kappa
[3:54:07] <%joylent_blue> Jeemukun you missed the car slide puzzle
[3:54:08] <+McSnazzyPants> @Onmi_Khaos i mean, you were never NOT a beat cop even with a legion
[3:54:09] <+nekodelic> Pat solving that puzzle is like Limmy's "steel is heavier than feathers" sketch
[3:54:10] <Valdorick> Look at these assholes
[3:54:19] <+McSnazzyPants> you're just doing regular work, instead of bullshit stand fight work
[3:54:22] <+Darren716> What's got Billy so spooked?
[3:54:24] <%joylent_blue> Jeemukun it took 20 minutes
[3:54:25] <TheLaw3D4> he seems nice
[3:54:37] <al0nem0nster> just another example of the human brain having an internal kernel error.
[3:54:46] <%AngriestAngryArtist> AngriestAngryArtist subscribed at Tier 1. They've subscribed for 5 months! HENSHIN!
[3:54:49] <+theotherkristian> Go Up Before You Go Down
[3:54:51] <%WackyGear> why is the sister in red?
[3:54:54] <%Dakuu75> maybe jsut stay outa the poor guy's business.
[3:54:55] <+rorschachsjournal505> How’d pat get that sick ass color for his legions?
[3:54:56] <%doc_ock_rokc> @AngriestPat Slide puzzles are created for children initially but psychologists figured out you can measure some sort of intelligence quotient from them so they made more challenging ones.
[3:54:56] <%Jeemukun> @joylent_blue amazing but expected
[3:55:01] <+Zeromaru2> Some people just aren't wired for puzzles
[3:55:05] <+theotherkristian> Go Up First
[3:55:15] <+templar010> BURNING
[3:55:19] <Idon__> HAHAHA

[3:55:26] <Blank9> it's not progress
[3:55:27] <Valdorick> RIP Ladder and Lappy
[3:55:29] <%joylent_blue> no do it tho
[3:55:32] <+Felto3> still a sidequest
[3:55:35] <Idon__> Don't worry this is just a sidemission
[3:55:35] <SlimeSlimeSlime> It's side-quest progress.
[3:55:35] <%Nope80808> Its not a story mission so its fine
[3:55:42] <al0nem0nster> oh side quest progress, neat.
[3:55:43] <+HyperCharge_Sam> This is an optional red case
[3:55:48] <+Pyroclase> I'm back, glad to see he finally beat the crate puzzle

[3:56:01] <al0nem0nster> crooked cops
[3:56:09] <Sphincter_Spelunker> I thought the hair didn't load in, but it's just the lighting
[3:56:24] <%AgentOrangeShoes> 410 BILLION DIRTY COPS
[3:56:24] <TheLaw3D4> More like baldy
[3:56:29] <%dekkitout> Why even bother smuggling weapons in this society
[3:56:35] <+McSnazzyPants> S T E A L T H
[3:56:37] <%13ry4n93> my god, that emo fringe
[3:56:41] <SlimeSlimeSlime> Fuyuhiko Kuzuryuu overhere.
[3:56:48] <TheLaw3D4> @dekkitout Weapons always sell
[3:56:53] <%joylent_blue> on one hand, stealth sections suck, but on the other hand, you can just hogtie everyone in this game so eh
[3:57:05] <%Piemen99> Alright What did I miss
[3:57:06] <al0nem0nster> I imagine given that at any point any member of the populace can randomly turn into a super powered demon monster, weapons are most likely prohibited.
[3:57:09] <%13ry4n93> pfft
[3:57:12] <+Zeromaru2> Cause people hate the ones in charge and are willing to comit violence to change it
[3:57:18] <%13ry4n93> pat could you not get immediately spotted
[3:57:20] <+McSnazzyPants> @Piemen99 over 30 minutes of car sliding puzzles
[3:57:20] <Onmi_Khaos> tailing missions are kinda trivial when you're a stand user
[3:57:21] <Zaphire_Saucypants> ignore
[3:57:29] <Zaphire_Saucypants> ignore meeeee
[3:57:35] <%Piemen99> good god
[3:57:45] <%doc_ock_rokc> @al0nem0nster that just makes the weapons argument easier. What if someone needs to protext themselves
[3:58:06] <%doc_ock_rokc> YOU RAN
[3:58:06] <Valdorick> Failed
[3:58:09] <%joylent_blue> don't run
[3:58:10] <@SSaryn> Noise is a factor too
[3:58:11] <BluBox> Don't run
[3:58:12] <WRFWD> He can hear you running
[3:58:13] <+HyperCharge_Sam> he turned to the right
[3:58:14] <%BestTeaMaker> sound
[3:58:15] <mayorrev> SNAAAAAAAKE
[3:58:16] <%joylent_blue> you were NOT behind anything
[3:58:19] <Zaphire_Saucypants> filthy non-croucher
[3:58:19] <Derkinstacker> he turned right
[3:58:22] <thedingisdongis> @angriestpat Would u recommend this game
[3:58:23] <+exploitativity2> in this context, aberrations grow their own weapons out of... corruption, or whatever
[3:58:23] <%doc_ock_rokc> Use soda cans to destract people
[3:58:26] <al0nem0nster> @doc_ock_rokc then they create a demon that now has a super powered gun in addition to a super powered sword arm, that's probably where the flying crossbow guys come from.
[3:58:28] <%umbypokochan> first you hear, and then you see
[3:58:28] <PrimeNeverproc> no runnin with scissors!
[3:58:37] <artificiallynatural> He's still on that puzzle?
[3:58:37] <Valdorick> Don't blame 'ya
[3:58:39] <+HyperCharge_Sam> LUL
[3:58:41] <Onmi_Khaos> Uh....
[3:58:42] <+abuptabe> Honesty think this file is the worst in the game
[3:58:45] <PrimeNeverproc> salty
[3:58:47] <Strider222> just look it up at youtube LUL
[3:58:47] <Derkinstacker> The puzzle is fine.
[3:58:48] <%doc_ock_rokc> @al0nem0nster no those are organic
[3:58:48] <%redrins> what if people like puzzles
[3:58:48] <+theotherkristian> Too Late
[3:58:48] <+Darren716> Why that puzzle is easy?
[3:58:48] <%umbypokochan> or do it and don't suck at it :P
[3:58:49] <+CharredChord> but you have to
[3:58:51] <Zaphire_Saucypants> don't perfect the game, essentially. Don't even try.
[3:58:52] <%dekkitout> Or cheat it with a guide
[3:58:53] <MasterDecoder> @wummzy fuckin' what?
[3:58:54] <+abuptabe> And the slide puzzles were after the box gyro shit
[3:58:55] <%Typhaeon> Or just look up a FAQ and get S+ by scumming
[3:58:57] <%joylent_blue> just look up the solution 4Head
[3:58:57] <TheLaw3D4> That puzzle is fine though. fun
[3:58:57] <Tucker0603> gitgud?
[3:58:57] <Zombrocom> I mean, I don't think most people have your troubles with slide puzzles
[3:58:59] <startstoprepeat> or do it, but better
[3:58:59] <%doc_ock_rokc> what mean?
[3:59:01] <+exploitativity2> if you stand up instead of crouching in the circles you get a special hiding animation @AngriestPat
[3:59:01] <%Edgy_Macaroon> we are all frustrated about that puzzle
[3:59:02] <%DeathsDoom> Its over pat the puzzle can no longer hurt you
[3:59:06] <%vectorless_peon> hes the one to faloe
[3:59:11] <%umbypokochan> just get your nephew to do it for you
[3:59:11] <+HyperCharge_Sam> you go into a hiding animation when you wait next to the wall
[3:59:15] <Derkinstacker> It can, hes gotta S+ it
[3:59:17] <+Darren716> I wish there were more vehicle puzzles in the post game
[3:59:19] <%joylent_blue> the puzzle wasn't real, pat, it was all a dream
[3:59:20] <+exploitativity2> EHSY
[3:59:23] <+exploitativity2> WHAT
[3:59:24] <Zaphire_Saucypants> one of my favorite hiding animations is the chill relaxed standing pose.
[3:59:25] <Strider222> STEALTH
[3:59:27] <Idon__> Garrett is blind, lmao
[3:59:29] <Onmi_Khaos> OH MY GOD

[3:59:31] <CrypticMochi> God gimped Pat out of puzzle solving skills
[3:59:36] <%Shadicara> That puzzle stole Pat's girlfriend
[3:59:39] <+nekodelic> chest
[3:59:44] <+exploitativity2> style
[3:59:45] <al0nem0nster> @doc_ock_rokc would have thought the corruption could also effect weapons.
[3:59:48] <UnfilteredComic> Giant sword sticking out LUL
[3:59:48] <+CCCPKi> hiding

[3:59:57] <@SSaryn> Especially with that Gladius still hanging out
[3:59:59] <Derkinstacker> he cant see that sword stickin out
[4:00:00] <Valdorick> Look Pat, someone was really proud of that animation.
[4:00:03] <Zaphire_Saucypants> For maximum cool factor, of course.
[4:00:05] <%King_Wolf_Rigger> Pat's stealth skills are so high, he had no points left for puzzle solving.
[4:00:05] <%d00msdaydan> hey what's with that sword sticking out from behind that wall? must be my imagination
[4:00:08] <waifoong98> LUL stealth
[4:00:13] <%doc_ock_rokc> @al0nem0nster we don't have proof of that only humans
[4:00:15] <%Shadicara> Didn't hear that stealthy stand roar
[4:00:19] <+theotherkristian> Pat Boy Get WTer
[4:00:25] <PrimeNeverproc> !uptime
[4:00:26] <@Moobot> I've been playing this game for how long? Oh only 4h 27s.
[4:00:33] <al0nem0nster> @doc_ock_rokc well humans and animals.
[4:00:35] <Valdorick> I like how he can see 2 guys on the ground
[4:00:45] <%Shadicara> Can they not? I thought they just couldn't see em
[4:00:53] <al0nem0nster> @doc_ock_rokc and clothes that humans are currently wearing as they transform.
[4:01:04] <mayorrev> what're they dealing
[4:01:07] <@SSaryn> Gotta save a little money here and there considering the whole games been money.
[4:01:09] <mayorrev> drugs?
[4:01:12] <%13ry4n93> weapons
[4:01:15] <%dekkitout> No one's work is going to waste
[4:01:17] <Tisaric> This is the padding level but everything is till fun enough that it doesn't matter
[4:01:18] <%Shadicara> Dealing stands
[4:01:18] <PrimeNeverproc> your sis look way cooler
[4:01:23] <%doc_ock_rokc> @al0nem0nster you mean the clothes that are ripped to shreads?
[4:01:28] <%13ry4n93> pokemon cards
[4:01:31] <+exploitativity2> I think the aberration's grown-out red matter weapons are more dangerous than regular weapons
[4:01:40] <%Shadicara> THIS GUY IS A LOOSE CANNON
[4:01:41] <+exploitativity2> or they couldn't use them
[4:01:42] <Tucker0603> TERROISTS
[4:01:43] <BitOSalt> Oh I did this file last night. soooo many side cases xD
[4:01:43] <Onmi_Khaos> L I T E R A L STAND
[4:01:43] <%joylent_blue> billy's sunglasses sure are cooooool
[4:01:47] <al0nem0nster> @doc_ock_rokc so you're saying the hoodies the corrupted have are also organic.
[4:01:52] <Valdorick> Is Billy a fucking ninja!? How the fuck did he get here so fast!?
[4:01:59] <tungstenviper> IT'S A FUCKING STAND
[4:02:04] <waifoong98> InViSiBlE
[4:02:07] <%dekkitout> The Hermits? Why didn't your best friend Kyle just ask?
[4:02:11] <%Shadicara> STANDO POWAH
[4:02:15] <%joylent_blue> monkaS
[4:02:20] <lionmanguy> Man even the evidence gathering animation is cool
[4:02:21] <%doc_ock_rokc> @al0nem0nster or that weird wood bone shit that grows
[4:02:23] <ne0bunny> shouldnt the hermits totally see your legion?
[4:02:35] <+McSnazzyPants> wait shit you're right
[4:02:37] <+exploitativity2> @ne0bunny wait you're right
[4:02:38] <mayorrev> FREEZE
[4:02:41] <Zaphire_Saucypants> only if they're using that blue shit.
[4:02:43] <+McSnazzyPants> unless they stopped taking blue evolve
[4:02:44] <SlimeSlimeSlime> I'm not terrorism!
[4:02:53] <%Shadicara> Cop fight!
[4:02:53] <%joylent_blue> ne0bunny only when they're high, and they can't be high ALL the time
[4:02:53] <+exploitativity2> if they can see chimeras...
[4:02:55] <%Mr_Strut> You are the terrorism
[4:02:56] <%13ry4n93> emo fringe powers activate!
[4:02:59] <tungstenviper> I'LL MAKE YOU UNDERTSAND
[4:02:59] <@SSaryn> How DARE you not understand
[4:03:00] <Zaphire_Saucypants> and after that snafu, I don't think they wanna BLUE UP anymore.
[4:03:01] <+McSnazzyPants> actually, considering what happened in file 6 they probably swore off of blue evolve for good
[4:03:11] <SlimeSlimeSlime> Hermit Purples?
[4:03:12] <%floralkami> @Valdorick you got this literal vigilante cop running around busting cops in his own group, and you wondering how he gets places?
[4:03:13] <Foso1jr> hey buddy
[4:03:17] <%dekkitout> I wanna see Billy kick Garry's ass tho
[4:03:20] <Onmi_Khaos> What is it with villains in this game not explaining shit?
[4:03:35] <%joylent_blue> i keep thinking your legion is Akira's
[4:03:36] <+Zeromaru2> Something about this seems suspicious or is it just me?
[4:03:41] <Onmi_Khaos> "I thought you'd understand" "I dont" "Well fuck trying to explain it to you."
[4:03:41] <al0nem0nster> @doc_ock_rokc looking at a picture of one right now and it looks like the corruption did some stuff to their clothes, changed the color at least if anything.
[4:03:43] <%Shadicara> Man this is even more unfair your sister helps you with another stand LUL
[4:03:47] <ne0bunny> they are still clearly pulsing with red energy
[4:03:47] <hassanico1> Akira did most of the work
[4:03:49] <anuchallengertwitch> Billy's changed alot since moving from Endsville
[4:03:49] <%Piemen99> Too bad you cant dab with your stands @AngriestPat
[4:03:54] <%DeathsDoom> @Onmi_Khaos the platnium way is for story to take the back seat
[4:04:11] <%doc_ock_rokc> @al0nem0nster well they have red matter all over them
[4:04:13] <+exploitativity2> @Onmi_Khaos in this context it's something between them that they haven't revealed to the player
[4:04:24] <Onmi_Khaos> Death I am not complaining, I love it
[4:04:31] <%joylent_blue> ! ON FIRE !
[4:04:32] <+theotherkristian> I Hope He Finds Man On Florr

[4:16:43] <+NeonBleu> that quiz is arbitrary as fuck
[4:16:44] <al0nem0nster> two different skill sets.
[4:16:45] <hassanico1> Mascot costumes are not fursuits you fucking degenerates

[4:16:46] <SlimeSlimeSlime> Those are two different things
[4:16:48] <%joylent_blue> those have NOTHING to do with each other LUL

[4:17:05] <+Zeromaru2> Memorization is different from Puzzle solving Come on guys
[4:17:06] <%decisivelynameless> People are dumb because they don't pay attention
[4:17:07] <%joylent_blue> chat is being dumb
[4:17:07] <Sphincter_Spelunker> One guy
[4:17:08] <@SSaryn> Literally not bringing up a point at all
[4:17:09] <%BlueMoonBlues> chat is dumbo
[4:17:12] <%dekkitout> "How are you good at trivia, but bad at spacial optimization, idiot dumb dumb?"
[4:17:13] <%King_Wolf_Rigger> It's memory verses whatever slide puzzles are. They're totally different things chat

[4:17:19] <tungstenviper> Pat is autistic... no biggie Kappa
[4:17:21] <tequilazaku> people be smart in one way, dont mean people smart in other way
[4:17:22] <al0nem0nster> Memory vs critical thinking and planning.
[4:17:24] <VJdarkworld> did pat ace the quiz?
[4:17:26] <deviljhojho94> IQ of chat in the double digitd

[4:17:30] <Idon__> Nice memory, pat, genuinely impressed
[4:17:32] <%joylent_blue> i just ballparked her age
[4:17:32] <%doc_ock_rokc> Its a different type of intelligence chat
[4:17:34] <%DeathsDoom> i guessed her age right based her wanting to be mommy lol
[4:17:37] <skinmansgds> BRUTE CHAT
[4:17:39] <Sphincter_Spelunker> single out too

[4:17:40] <%Black_Machete> I got Marie birthday queation
[4:17:41] <+JacktheMan18> Memory and puzzle solving ability are not that related to each other guys
[4:17:43] <%King_Wolf_Rigger> Big Clumbo
[4:17:46] <Hollowknight45> yeah
[4:17:47] <+theotherkristian> Pat's IQ seems to be: yes
[4:17:47] <+corinv> Chat Nemesis
[4:17:48] <%goose_attack_almanac> Pat has a fantastic memory. But Slide Puzzles confound him.
[4:17:49] <WRFWD> Memory and puzzle solving aren't the same thing
[4:17:50] <CrypticMochi> Now you need Lappy’s dick
[4:17:50] <+Pyroclase> Memory is more of a trait than a skill
[4:17:53] <%doc_ock_rokc> Pat is better at Memorization then visualization
[4:17:54] <SlimeSlimeSlime> Might as well ask how someone can juggle but not ride a unicycle.
[4:17:54] <al0nem0nster> no, trust us, memmory is indeed a skill.
[4:17:58] <%floralkami> Intelligence doesn't have anything to do with memory
[4:17:58] <mayorrev> 3 3 3 3 3
[4:17:58] <Hollowknight45> yeah you right
[4:17:59] <Onmi_Khaos> Memory is absolutely a skill
[4:18:01] <VJdarkworld> @McSnazzyPants lappy would be proud :O
[4:18:01] <%King_Wolf_Rigger> Chat is fighting chat
[4:18:03] <+Pyroclase> Pat put all his points into memory
[4:18:03] <%BlueMoonBlues> Remembering is kindof a skill
[4:18:03] <TheLaw3D4> That was like weeks ago though

[4:18:09] <%Futurecity10> @AngriestPat What is Maries weight
[4:18:10] <fazoburquina> @AngriestPat wait, if the stands are invisible and you can ride the wolf legion, do normal people just see you thrust floating in the air real fast?
[4:18:11] <%joylent_blue> memory can be good or bad, yours is good
[4:18:14] <MaeMae94> Pat, some peoples memory isn't that good, especially with details
[4:18:17] <%umbypokochan> as far as i know, the brain can only hold 9 major categories of stuff, so maybe slide puzzles can't fit in pat's brain
[4:18:17] <Sphincter_Spelunker> But BABA
[4:18:19] <+exploitativity2> what are marie's measurements
[4:18:20] <%vectorless_peon> Chat Nemisis
[4:18:23] <$speedwagon1945> wait so are those dogs stands?
[4:18:25] <al0nem0nster> You look like a character who's animation is glitching.
[4:18:25] <Derkinstacker> I can't do Simon says, anything more than 4 will completely ruin me.
[4:18:25] <%BestTeaMaker> hopefully pat will do ch9
[4:18:25] <hassanico1> Look it's ok Pat, you're still dumb to us
[4:18:26] <%DeathsDoom> EVERYDAY
[4:18:28] <mayorrev> BABA CEASES TO BE
[4:18:29] <Ipsenscastle> 1
[4:18:30] <%dekkitout> Apparently recalling 'trivial' characterization is a skill
[4:18:36] <+corinv> Her honkers add at least 100lbs
[4:18:39] <$speedwagon1945> are the dogs invisible to other people
[4:18:39] <PrimeNeverproc> baba doesnt like that
[4:18:39] <ShichiNoBushi> You can check later.

[4:18:43] <al0nem0nster> yes, recall is a skill that can be trained.
[4:18:44] <+BeatBoxersDevMike> i remember having a lot of IRIS related questions in my lappy quiz
[4:18:44] <Valdorick> When can we expect a "I don't understand" and a "How can this be!?" emote from you and paige Kappa
[4:18:49] <al0nem0nster> some people have a talent for it.
[4:18:50] <Zaphire_Saucypants> I'm surprised this game hasn't given us her "measurements".
[4:18:51] <%mister___doctor> Pat heted the hardest question what is Lappys secret identity
[4:18:52] <%King_Wolf_Rigger> Marie's measurements are "TOO FUCKING STACKED"
[4:18:52] <%spacehouse> Marie's weight is dummy thicc
[4:18:56] <hassanico1> >19%
[4:19:03] <ne0bunny> somehow lappy is lighter than marie, think about that
[4:19:04] <+theotherkristian> I beleive walking around just gets you a boss at some point
[4:19:06] <+corinv> She says that no matter what
[4:19:07] <+exploitativity2> she just says that every time
[4:19:10] <+Jonesman64> she has about a 90 cm bust I remember
[4:19:13] <Hollowknight45> you did
[4:19:15] <%Niney_Who> apatHoldon
[4:19:15] <WRFWD> Yes
[4:19:15] <Strider222> yeah she always asks this
[4:19:15] <@SSaryn> Marie is a gud waifu ok dont bring her into this
[4:19:15] <UnfilteredComic> Just to make sure

[4:22:58] <tungstenviper> OH LOOK!!! DEATH STRANDING!!!
[4:23:04] <Captain_Aham> the dimension where EVERYTHING is clean
[4:23:05] <+BeatBoxersDevMike> its already in place
[4:23:08] <SlimeSlimeSlime> That's the main one, it doesn't move
[4:23:10] <+BeatBoxersDevMike> gotta get the other 2
[4:23:11] <ShichiNoBushi> More pillars.
[4:23:14] <%doc_ock_rokc> Are we in the OLDEST HOUSE
[4:23:27] <al0nem0nster> I should start calling hyper space the framerate dimension, because that's the dimension you have to go to if you want to stop lagging from going too fast.
[4:23:34] <hassanico1> he's being stumbo again
[4:23:37] <Sphincter_Spelunker> @doc_ock_rokc We're the Threshold Kids
[4:23:41] <+Jonesman64> the puzzle dimension
[4:23:52] <al0nem0nster> ...your sword skill probably
[4:23:57] <al0nem0nster> or that I guess.
[4:23:59] <al0nem0nster> sure.
[4:24:15] <UnfilteredComic> I used Air Shot skill to hit them all
[4:24:30] <SlimeSlimeSlime> Feather touch
[4:25:06] <%doc_ock_rokc> can't wait for the second slide puzzle (I don't really know if there is a second slide puzzle
[4:25:22] <%dekkitout> Lassoing the shard things is a feature, right
[4:25:35] <%doc_ock_rokc> @dekkitout no its a bug
[4:25:39] <+Felto3> does this count as a slide puzzle?
[4:25:50] <+BeatBoxersDevMike> you can let go of right stick
[4:25:53] <%doc_ock_rokc> I must get oil to my brother
[4:26:20] <Captain_Aham> pat, what's your favorite legion so far?
[4:26:34] <+Jonesman64> this puzzle is where the difference it legion speeds really show
[4:26:55] <WRFWD> Isn't it great how your sister is right there to help you?
[4:27:10] <%doc_ock_rokc> Akira is really pulling her weight
[4:27:14] <+Jonesman64> sister is such a big helper
[4:27:14] <al0nem0nster> what built all a secret switch in the astral plain?
[4:27:16] <PrimeNeverproc> she real useful
[4:27:22] <vexion_smh> LUL
[4:27:22] <MasterDecoder> If only
[4:27:26] <Sphincter_Spelunker> don't oogle your sister
[4:27:28] <%filialpails> that's how she's helping
[4:27:32] <UnfilteredComic> "No i cant feel my legs"
[4:27:32] <%whiskey_wolfe_> Reminder: Pat has actual sis
[4:27:33] <%Shadicara> I wish Kreygasm
[4:27:34] <%dekkitout> Akira: "Actually, yes"
[4:27:34] <%supersugoisenpai1> She needs to show off her butt
[4:27:37] <al0nem0nster> emotional support I guess.
[4:27:37] <cureneckbeard> what? paige isn't ehre
[4:27:39] <%Engwithan_Elder_God> I mean. Why even wear shorts?
[4:27:41] <hassanico1> why are you so jealous of her pants?
[4:27:41] <ShichiNoBushi> You were envying her outfit last session.
[4:27:42] <@SSaryn> Sis is being pretty sneaky
[4:28:09] <%13ry4n93> sis being useless
[4:28:10] <al0nem0nster> So has Pat gotten to the dmc air juggle level where you can just have an entire fight midair yet?
[4:28:38] <+BeatBoxersDevMike> Arrow Legion Hit Rush is really good against ranged minions
[4:28:41] <+theotherkristian> that's possible
[4:28:45] <+CharredChord> What are those time bubbles
[4:28:47] <%mister___doctor> Tight pants make for smoother combat. Less chance of them falling down.
[4:28:47] <al0nem0nster> No I mean skill level
[4:28:49] <al0nem0nster> not game level
[4:28:57] <CybertronPrime> Oh, is this E2?
[4:28:58] <SlimeSlimeSlime> That's a gosh darn Stand right there
[4:28:58] <%CopperTucker> Is this Shinryu EX
[4:28:59] <%dekkitout> That looks like a Nekros Deluxe skin
[4:29:04] <hassanico1> So many Greek names
[4:29:05] <@commanderclaw> That guy kinda reminds me of Shinryu
[4:29:06] <%whiskey_wolfe_> Oh you're ... not that big
[4:29:08] <+Jonesman64> calistoes?
[4:29:12] <al0nem0nster> meh whatever he'll forget what I said anyway.
[4:29:15] <tungstenviper> looks very Z.O.E.
[4:29:21] <KazMkII> FRAMES
[4:29:27] <PrimeNeverproc> where are frames
[4:29:27] <%Scrub_Seeker> oh no the framerate dimension is dropping frames
[4:29:34] <+McSnazzyPants> that's the hit stop you dumbs
[4:29:36] <%Ascethetic> So, how did Akira get her Legion back? I missed it
[4:29:39] <%Keyd00d> it's the hit stop
[4:29:46] <%Scrub_Seeker> naw that was framerate
[4:29:59] <Saltmeisterr> did i miss the boss fight?
[4:30:01] <+BeatBoxersDevMike> i love chaing hit rushes as i cycle every legion
[4:30:12] <+Muzzle131> Akira got it after the commander experimented on her when she was injured
[4:30:17] <Saltmeisterr> mother was hogging the interwebs
[4:30:23] <Derkinstacker> Now back to the dog.
[4:30:29] <KazMkII> What's your favorite Legion Pat?
[4:30:35] <+Edrem> pet the doggo
[4:30:42] <Hollowknight45> dog
[4:30:46] <Hollowknight45> yeag
[4:30:56] <hassanico1> dogz sux
[4:30:57] <%Keyd00d> apatJpeg
[4:30:58] <Saltmeisterr> so whats the deal for this chapter?
[4:31:03] <al0nem0nster> So since the rest of the world is rendered uninhabitable due to data corruption, shouldn't it be literally raining red matter on a regular basis, or is water immune?
[4:31:05] <Saltmeisterr> just got here
[4:31:06] <+McSnazzyPants> oh shit didn't know that was there
[4:31:07] <restingbones> Good dog
[4:31:08] <+Jonesman64> good dog
[4:31:09] <%vectorless_peon> good
[4:31:10] <$TheCrispyBoi> good boy
[4:31:11] <Derkinstacker> there you go
[4:31:12] <%Keyd00d> dog smells evil
[4:31:23] <hassanico1> bad dog, it was working with the chimeras
[4:31:30] <Zombrocom> @al0nem0nster They didn't think about the setting that hard
[4:31:35] <al0nem0nster> ah, alright then.
[4:31:40] <%Shadicara> So pat who's the best stand so far?
[4:31:41] <MasterDecoder> @al0nem0nster Anime, don't question it
[4:31:44] <%Keyd00d> I love that chain combo
[4:32:06] <%supersugoisenpai1> ora ora ora
[4:32:07] <+McSnazzyPants> who's to say red matter even evaporates
[4:32:17] <Escherite> Fuck-O's, part of a balanced breakfast
[4:32:28] <hassanico1> Have we seen a Diomedes since Case 2?
[4:32:29] <+Jonesman64> love the sound of shit just dying
[4:32:40] <Huntercd> Did anyone make a Geese or Rock in this?
[4:32:42] <%mister___doctor> I've gotta get the Fuck-O's cereal!
[4:32:42] <%Keyd00d> BOOM
[4:32:44] <al0nem0nster> @McSnazzyPants Dunno, but allot of it seems to be floating in the air at the moment.
[4:32:50] <%King_Wolf_Rigger> damn that's sick
[4:32:55] <%ToadKing> @Huntercd woolie made a geese in his playthrough going on
[4:32:59] <%doc_ock_rokc> @Huntercd Woolie
[4:33:16] <%Keyd00d> fly boys
[4:33:29] <%supersugoisenpai1> No big boys, but a lot of flying fuck-o's
[4:34:00] <+temporal_zenith> @ToadKing It gives the feeling that Max named his kids based on various media he likes
[4:34:33] <%mister___doctor> Man Pat you've really been chained to this game huh
[4:34:36] <%Cthulos> Gladius is so fuckin' cool
[4:34:38] <hassanico1> It's "Zeus"
[4:34:41] <+Jonesman64> have you photoed these ones?
[4:34:41] <%ToadKing> these chimera are the best, just blobby bois
[4:34:48] <%skizzuto> auto-bind and the beast legion's howl are so useful for crowd control
[4:34:49] <UnfilteredComic> Love beasts perfect call
[4:34:50] <Sphincter_Spelunker> Know what I think of when I see sheep-bleating frogs? Zeus
[4:34:55] <%Cthulos> blobby goat bois that go Mehehejehe
[4:34:56] <%skizzuto> Axe legion is best legion
[4:35:03] <%skizzuto> he has BIG damage
[4:35:04] <%Keyd00d> soontm
[4:35:08] <Derkinstacker> Soon
[4:35:09] <StormBuster24> Axe legion's got some cool stuff
[4:35:11] <+Sutibun95> I wonder why they make goat noises
[4:35:13] <al0nem0nster> Is the sister's legion always unchained, or can you just not see the chain from that distance?
[4:35:15] <%mister___doctor> Axe Legion wrecks shit
[4:35:16] <UnfilteredComic> I hated axe legion at first but hes grown on me
[4:35:17] <Derkinstacker> If you like the cleaver, axe legion is the best.
[4:35:17] <%Cthulos> mehehe
[4:35:23] <%Keyd00d> she has a red chain
[4:35:27] <+jkobe34> axe leigon is broken when given a bunch of attack up's
[4:35:31] <Sphincter_Spelunker> It's a long axe, shuttup
[4:35:35] <+BeatBoxersDevMike> its a switch axe from monster hunter
[4:35:36] <Idon__> It's like uhh berserker from fate
[4:35:36] <@commanderclaw> I kinda looks like a switch axe
[4:35:42] <ShichiNoBushi> It's a really big sword that might as well be an axe.
[4:35:43] <al0nem0nster> ah there it is, just really hard to see
[4:35:44] <%miguelrod777> its a hercules axe
[4:35:44] <Idon__> or the switch axe from monhun
[4:35:47] <bearwagon> its a future axe
[4:35:49] <%skizzuto> it's more like cloud's buster sword kinda
[4:35:53] <Valdorick> More like Bardiche Legion, amirite?
[4:35:55] <%skizzuto> but more anime
[4:35:57] <skinmansgds> an axe-sword
[4:36:00] <%arancet> I don't like axe legion much...
[4:36:04] <VJdarkworld> axe legion with the mass produced eva sword
[4:36:05] <%redrins> they had to call him something and sword was already taken
[4:36:09] <WRFWD> They probably didn't like the name "Big Sword Legion"
[4:36:13] <al0nem0nster> so what's the japanes name for axe legion? since it's not actually an axe.
[4:36:13] <%Torruun> apatJpeg apatJpeg apatJpeg
[4:36:13] <%miguelrod777> SEKAI ICHIBAN
[4:36:16] <deviljhojho94> good shit
[4:36:26] <+temporal_zenith> Doggo: 'Good job human'
[4:36:26] <+BeatBoxersDevMike> i just realized it gives you the missed dropped chips
[4:36:28] <skinmansgds> Really anything that looks like it's more of limb-chopping than slicing or stabbing can be called an axe
[4:36:29] <Pyrenity> Aww you can't pet dog in this game. :(
[4:36:29] <Idon__> "That thing was too big to be called a sword."
[4:36:33] <+CharredChord> Can't pet the real dog but you can pet the demon dog
[4:36:36] <%Cthulos> Max Howard uses axe legion, right?
[4:36:38] <%Keyd00d> Longsword legion
[4:36:42] <al0nem0nster> "Buster legion" maybe?
[4:36:44] <+Jonesman64> one of the parts coming up is really rough
[4:36:45] <42nfl19> doggo>
[4:36:53] <%skizzuto> should have named sword legion to blade legion and given axe legion the name sword legion
[4:36:54] <Sphincter_Spelunker> hey step mom
[4:36:55] <%spacehouse> Thick sword legion
[4:36:58] <%Cthulos> buster legion'd be sick
[4:36:58] <AbysmalWulf> Claymore Legion maybe?
[4:36:58] <42nfl19> does pat not want to check out the doggo?
[4:37:06] <%miguelrod777> i love my moma
[4:37:07] <%Keyd00d> he just did

[4:37:24] <%aeravon> Mannnn that buns tech
[4:37:33] <%decisivelynameless> You can shoot'em
[4:37:35] <+Jonesman64> Alicia: bringing truth to the thick thighs save lives
[4:37:37] <+temporal_zenith> Go close those Oblivion Gates Pat
[4:37:38] <%Cthulos> is there a guard/parry on one of the X-Baton modes or does a legion have one that isn't perfect call
[4:37:40] <+Reizie_Etherealm> Buster Legion, Heavy Legion, Great Legion, MAX Legion
[4:37:43] <%DeathsDoom> i did it with auto bind
[4:37:44] <%Keyd00d> use brain
[4:37:47] <ShichiNoBushi> But box...
[4:37:49] <%mister___doctor> I love how Woolies not feeling the Toilet Fairy at all
[4:37:52] <%miguelrod777> BERSERKER LEGION
[4:37:52] <+BeatBoxersDevMike> its a police invisible barrier
[4:37:53] <%skizzuto> I'm gonna be honest I didn't figure this one out
[4:37:56] <%Keyd00d> big wrap
[4:37:59] <WRFWD> Use autobind on those portals
[4:38:02] <UnfilteredComic> just wrap it
[4:38:07] <%Keyd00d> you can wrap it normally
[4:38:08] <+BeatBoxersDevMike> lets wrap this up
[4:38:09] <skinmansgds> wrap the entire thing
[4:38:12] <skinmansgds> there we go
[4:38:14] <Sphincter_Spelunker> Get some sleep, dude
[4:38:16] <WRFWD> Or that, that works too
[4:38:17] <%skizzuto> the chest I mean, not the gate
[4:38:18] <+Jonesman64> FUCK YOUR RESEARCH GATE CLOSED
[4:38:28] <Hillthugsta> look at those DSLs
[4:38:30] <%Louie_Salmon> @cthulos Well Axe legion has that, funnily enough
[4:38:31] <%Cthulos> do I have to take pictures of people to get new color schemes?
[4:38:35] <al0nem0nster> Wonder how long it'll take before we start having Cop OC's with OC legions.
[4:38:42] <+Reizie_Etherealm> Sick
[4:38:42] <+BeatBoxersDevMike> big parrys
[4:38:45] <SlimeSlimeSlime> Gladiator pit!
[4:38:48] <KazMkII> @AngriestPat Do you think this game relies on the Astral Plane too much?
[4:38:59] <%Cthulos> My cop is already an OC
[4:39:16] <%Cthulos> once I get punch legion, it's gonna be STR
[4:39:17] <waifoong98> what's a cop with out his tools Kappa
[4:39:27] <Valdorick> FPS dimension.
[4:39:27] <UnfilteredComic> And the astral plane is still cool looking
[4:39:28] <+zaworldo> dide
[4:39:33] <+zaworldo> did axe yet
[4:39:36] <%ToadKing> they use it a lot in this file because the framerate in this one sucks shit
[4:39:51] <+Jonesman64> astral plane also reminds me a little of third contact
[4:39:52] <%Cthulos> Max Howard is so fucking cool, too
[4:39:56] <Valdorick> Village hidden in the Frames
[4:40:15] <ShichiNoBushi> Blade Wolf: "Combination complete."
[4:40:21] <+Pyroclase> It'
[4:40:25] <al0nem0nster> it reminds me allot of the data scapes in digimon games and megaman battle network.
[4:40:32] <%BestTeaMaker> beast 360 is so good
[4:40:34] <%Typhaeon> Get wombo's
[4:40:37] <%Typhaeon> wombo'd*
[4:40:40] <+Pyroclase> s pretty weird how similar this astral plane is to the one in Control. they've both made out of shiny blocks.
[4:41:03] <Huntercd> Halle Berry dog combos
[4:41:03] <+temporal_zenith> @al0nem0nster It does remind me of the Cyber Sleuth ones and the Eclipse Gates from Tokyo Xanadu
[4:41:04] <skinmansgds> It's almost like shiny blocks are easy to make
[4:41:26] <%Typhaeon> That's awesome
[4:41:32] <blackorchidKI2> I do like the dark color palette
[4:41:34] <+BeatBoxersDevMike> the final skill on arm legion is the best
[4:41:34] <%Cthulos> so is the reason for your cop being able to do this shit because they're genetically modified or do they earn their Legion's respect. who wants to take bets?
[4:41:36] <%dekkitout> JUSTICE Rains from Above!
[4:41:37] <Valdorick> Yeah Thanatos, use Ignorant Masses.
[4:41:48] <%umbypokochan> blocks: drake's like nah ... shiny blocks: drake's like yeeaaaah
[4:41:56] <%Cthulos> unless that was already answered
[4:41:59] <al0nem0nster> @temporal_zenith and if you look closely you can see the MC from Control doing platforming puzzles in the background.
[4:42:14] <skinmansgds> "Compatibility" and birth circumstances are the answer so far
[4:42:19] <%Cthulos> @al0nem0nster I thought the same thing lol
[4:42:28] <+theotherkristian> drink your vater plat
[4:42:37] <+BeatBoxersDevMike> the police are stoppin you
[4:42:39] <UnfilteredComic> Its tricky
[4:42:41] <%miguelrod777> probably already answered mom was redshifting when birthing the twin so tbey probably part chimera
[4:42:44] <Strider222> HEY
[4:42:46] <Idon__> careful, woolie's sleeping in there
[4:42:55] <skinmansgds> There's a file about the birth circumstances that I think is unlocked by now
[4:43:04] <megaminimechamocha> So judging from last stream, where is Pat? Half way through File 7?
[4:43:08] <%Cthulos> @miguelrod777 ahhh...
[4:43:09] <%Louie_Salmon> @cthulos Just certain people, we're like 15 hours in here
[4:43:21] <Pyrenity> Is there something over?
[4:43:23] <Derkinstacker> LZ at top of stairs
[4:43:24] <+BeatBoxersDevMike> you can get over a few obsticles with a little hop: BACK FORWARD ATTACK+ SYNC + DODGE
[4:43:25] <UnfilteredComic> Put chimera on grated ledge, walk though gate with it summoned, then chainjump to it so that you stop at the ledge @AngriestPat
[4:43:30] <WRFWD> don't move forward
[4:43:35] <ne0bunny> just push your legion through that break in fence, it will slowly go over it
[4:43:40] <%skizzuto> pat you're heading towards progress
[4:43:41] <al0nem0nster> @BeatBoxersDevMike that intentional?
[4:43:50] <+BeatBoxersDevMike> probably not for this, but it works
[4:43:52] <Valdorick> Look at that Mario Galaxy Stage
[4:43:55] <%Cthulos> gotta pump the bioengineered babies out of those redshifting parents
[4:43:56] <%rumtumtugnutz> tasty stand goo
[4:44:03] <+CCCPKi> You dont have to and you were
[4:44:04] <Derkinstacker> you dont NEED to.
[4:44:05] <%skizzuto> no these are optional, the yellow dot is progress
[4:44:12] <Derkinstacker> LZ at top of stairs through broken fence.
[4:44:18] <megaminimechamocha> Also I'd like to sarcastically thank all the trash people who ruined the Sans debate for everyone
[4:44:18] <UnfilteredComic> NICE
[4:44:22] <%skizzuto> oh shit that's clever
[4:44:22] <SlimeSlimeSlime> Woah
[4:44:27] <%ToadKing> that almost seems like a sequence break
[4:44:31] <%Cthulos> Get the dad to impregnate while redshifting and then get momma to redshift while undergoing labor
[4:44:38] <Derkinstacker> DUCK
[4:44:42] <al0nem0nster> guess now we see the actual way you were supposed to get there.
[4:44:44] <%Cthulos> double down the POWER
[4:44:46] <SlimeSlimeSlime> Crawl like the snake that you are
[4:44:55] <+BeatBoxersDevMike> running attack slides a bit into crouch sections
[4:45:00] <+Pyroclase> an action game with a crouch button, imagine that
[4:45:01] <%dukenux> hnrgh chief
[4:45:11] <%Cthulos> I love running attack
[4:45:16] <%Typhaeon> Rectangular lenses in icon. Game ruined
[4:45:19] <KungFuStarfish> Hi folks
[4:45:21] <ShichiNoBushi> Swirly Glasses?
[4:45:31] <+Jonesman64> dammnit.. I misssed how to get down here
[4:45:32] <waifoong98> Does platinum have an affinity for rooftop or something...
[4:45:35] <%dukenux> im trying to sneak up on those gangbangers, but my Legion is dummy thicc, and keeps stuck in things
[4:45:41] <+Jonesman64> I had to cheese my way down here
[4:45:54] <%joylent_blue> stuck forever
[4:46:05] <%rumtumtugnutz> SMORT
[4:46:07] <megaminimechamocha> This game has so many weird invisible walls and side paths that would just be a short jump or crawling section to pass in other games.
[4:46:07] <vexion_smh> Smart pat LUL
[4:46:16] <valriot> PogChamp
[4:46:17] <megaminimechamocha> Pat is S M O R T
[4:46:18] <%dukenux> Rooftop is a nice place where you can show off your skybox
[4:46:18] <KungFuStarfish> So this guy like anime Leon Kennedy?
[4:46:30] <Derkinstacker> "Hey i was studying that!"
[4:46:41] <waifoong98> Makes sense @dukenux
[4:46:42] <%dukenux> MonkaS
[4:46:43] <%ToadKing> YO REMEMBER ME FUCKO
[4:46:43] <+Jonesman64> THESE DUUDES
[4:46:44] <al0nem0nster> Isn't Leon Kennedy anime Leon Kennedy?
[4:46:45] <Valdorick> Welcome to the fuck box
[4:46:48] <Sphincter_Spelunker> ✋
[4:46:52] <%dukenux> I like the arena music
[4:46:53] <%Cthulos> Gotta play FemC for them booty shorts and tights zoneSmug zoneZT
[4:46:55] <%joylent_blue> that mf went flyin
[4:46:56] <SlimeSlimeSlime> Pretty sneaky sis!
[4:46:58] <+BeatBoxersDevMike> at least the hop trick doesnt get you out of bounds or places you shouldnt be. it just helps for getting do some areas early that take a bit of extra work to get towards
[4:46:59] <%dekkitout> Now you face the slam jam bros
[4:47:14] <megaminimechamocha> K
[4:47:19] <anuchallengertwitch> Can I just say I love the aesthetic of tears in reality being visualized as glicthy blocks?
[4:47:20] <+VektorTroika> DEAD ON
[4:47:24] <+imthinkingdarbys> I finally remembered what the targeting reticle reminds me of, Killer is Dead
[4:47:33] <al0nem0nster> most of us love that aesthetic.
[4:47:39] <KazMkII> I feel like those heavy slashes should do more damage to you . . .
[4:47:44] <megaminimechamocha> I can't wait to see Woolie do this kind of stuff in 30 to 40 weeks, also when's RE2 Stream LUL
[4:47:47] <%joylent_blue> you're right and you should say it
[4:47:53] <+Jonesman64> @anuchallengertwitch that has been an awesome aesthetic since dot hack and the like
[4:47:58] <+Jonesman64> and I love it too
[4:48:02] <SlimeSlimeSlime> Harpy time!
[4:48:04] <waifoong98> @megaminimechamocha LUL
[4:48:08] <KungFuStarfish> Is the chain also a form of symbolism?
[4:48:17] <Valdorick> wait, is he standing floating!?
[4:48:20] <%joylent_blue> not sure if woolie's interested in doing Claire B
[4:48:21] <megaminimechamocha> @KungFuStarfish For slavery, yes
[4:48:22] <al0nem0nster> THERE WE GO, That's the combat hangtime I was talking about!
[4:48:23] <+BeatBoxersDevMike> gravity storm makes all flying enemies trivial
[4:48:24] <Valdorick> Stand(
[4:48:34] <KungFuStarfish> Hmm 🤔 ty
[4:48:35] <%dekkitout> Of course it's a form of symbolism, in fact, it's made of symbolism
[4:48:50] <ht109> this file feels like filler
[4:48:53] <CrypticMochi> Symbolizes Eva unit porn
[4:48:56] <anuchallengertwitch> @Jonesman64 It makes feel like there's a glitch in reality or something
[4:49:12] <%dekkitout> See Kojima's rope analogy for more
[4:49:15] <al0nem0nster> If they wanted filler they would have added the mountains and mountains of paperwork doing any of this would entail.
[4:49:16] <+VektorTroika> @KungFuStarfish Astral Stranding
[4:49:18] <KungFuStarfish> Now I fell uncomfortable with slavery symbolism with a police officer
[4:49:32] <%joylent_blue> i love that combo string
[4:49:34] <+CharredChord> it's my fav combo
[4:49:45] <waifoong98> chains is obviously symbolism for Shibari Kappa
[4:49:47] <UnfilteredComic> Swords Perfect Call Kreygasm
[4:49:54] <megaminimechamocha> @KungFuStarfish something something prison industrial complex etc
[4:50:02] <%joylent_blue> VERY nice
[4:50:04] <Huntercd> BDSM?
[4:50:09] <al0nem0nster> Pat's gotten really good at the combat.
[4:50:13] <+VektorTroika> @UnfilteredComic let it rip!
[4:50:14] <+BeatBoxersDevMike> they should have a dlc chapter with lappy missions
[4:50:23] <%Louie_Salmon> @kungfustarfish You and everyone review-bombing the game
[4:50:32] <Sphincter_Spelunker> @megaminimechamocha you mean a CHAIN gang? Kappa
[4:50:45] <KungFuStarfish> The meta critic score that bad?
[4:50:46] <%joylent_blue> Sphincter_Spelunker shut UP
[4:51:04] <anuchallengertwitch> I love the animation where the legion holds the core
[4:51:06] <Sphincter_Spelunker> @joylent_blue you hate it cuz it's true
[4:51:07] <+BeatBoxersDevMike> metacritic removed the reviewbomb scores, so now it's actually abnormally high
[4:51:08] <SlimeSlimeSlime> S+!
[4:51:17] <+Jonesman64> so how do you get down to the lower section under the cat walk?
[4:51:25] <Derkinstacker> Big pure platinum.
[4:51:27] <aliasz50> @louie_salmon i'm pretty sure people review bombed the game because it was a switch exclusive
[4:51:27] <%joylent_blue> its true i hate the truth
[4:51:33] <+corinv> I mean it is called Peace
[4:51:37] <Captain_Aham> just you wait
[4:51:38] <%BestTeaMaker> it's called Peace
[4:51:38] <Idon__> HOLD UP PAT
[4:51:39] <+ProtagonistJake> peaks and valleys dude
[4:51:42] <%Keyd00d> yeah it is
[4:51:43] <%dalmek> all we need now is a nice relaxing sliding puzzle
[4:51:43] <%Keyd00d> hmm
[4:51:44] <WRFWD> Don't worry, things only gey crazier after this
[4:51:45] <KungFuStarfish> Oh that seems la tad aggressive
[4:51:48] <waifoong98> hmmmmmmm
[4:51:51] <ShichiNoBushi> Not even 50% Red Matter yet.
[4:51:53] <al0nem0nster> Like a beach episode after a major fight ark.
[4:51:55] <haisho> what file is this
[4:51:55] <+Jonesman64> red matter on the building
[4:51:58] <+corinv> I guess they figured they should slot in a super chilled, optional mission after the last two being heavy on action
[4:52:00] <%joylent_blue> File 8
[4:52:01] <%Louie_Salmon> @aliasz50 That too, but there were definitely people going "Police protagonists. Police bad. Game bad."
[4:52:02] <%miguelrod777> hang out with your definently not brainwashed sister
[4:52:02] <megaminimechamocha> Does the story *eventually* explore the fact that you are in fact fighting using your own slave monster?
[4:52:02] <%Keyd00d> it's like the calm before... something
[4:52:03] <+CCCPKi> @haisho 8
[4:52:08] <+FackuIkari> you need that breathing room for what's coming
[4:52:10] <Idon__> the catwalk
[4:52:13] <+BeatBoxersDevMike> go back
[4:52:16] <+BeatBoxersDevMike> or hop trick
[4:52:17] <megaminimechamocha> @Louie_Salmon citation needed
[4:52:20] <Derkinstacker> Chain as far as you can, then send him over then chain again.
[4:52:34] <Idon__> just levitate using the ladder behind
[4:52:41] <TioXyco> if it's there, there's probably a way to go
[4:52:44] <%joylent_blue> megaminimechamocha there was someone in chat saying that the other day lol
[4:52:47] <anuchallengertwitch> It's like a filler episode. This game and Asura's Wrath are basically a playable Anime.
[4:52:52] <KungFuStarfish> CAn you do small amounts of platforming?
[4:52:55] <%ToadKing> i missed so much shit because my tiny lizard brain never found that trick
[4:52:57] <%joylent_blue> "cool game but cop protag, too bad"
[4:52:58] <Idon__> "Oh you can't use *this* ladder"
[4:53:04] <+bicboichavo> Pat, I wanna see you wash your legion man.
[4:53:06] <Idon__> "that other ladder though is fine
[4:53:15] <vexion_smh> Nice
[4:53:16] <%Louie_Salmon> @megaminimechamocha I saw it less than zero times on Twitter which is too many.
[4:53:18] <Idon__> yay more murder
[4:53:22] <anuchallengertwitch> Can just regular jump in this game?
[4:53:23] <+BeatBoxersDevMike> follow the frames
[4:53:24] <UnfilteredComic> THATS WHERE IT IS???
[4:53:31] <%joylent_blue> they were a sub too, so i doubt they were trollin
[4:53:33] <haisho> IT'S A MYSTERY
[4:53:35] <UnfilteredComic> god dangit thats the one case im missing
[4:53:38] <+corinv> I'm 55 missions into the postgame and I still have literally no idea what legion maintenance actually does
[4:53:44] <+BeatBoxersDevMike> use the hop trick i guess
[4:53:46] <+BeatBoxersDevMike> BACK FORWARD ATTACK+ SYNC + DODGE
[4:53:49] <%Louie_Salmon> @anuchallengertwitch Nope, platforming is built around the chain jump
[4:53:57] <+Pyroclase> I'm not surprised. There a lot of people who really, really don't like the police these days.
[4:54:04] <Sphincter_Spelunker> Makes you feel good
[4:54:04] <+BeatBoxersDevMike> i dont think it does
[4:54:07] <Idon__> legion maitenance don't do shit
[4:54:07] <%BestTeaMaker> it allows you to change colors
[4:54:08] <ShichiNoBushi> Dumb you can't step up 2 feet.
[4:54:11] <InvaderKAZ> It increases movement speed and "responsiveness"
[4:54:12] <%Keyd00d> it makes them faster
[4:54:13] <%joylent_blue> it makes them HATE you, so thats cool
[4:54:14] <%BestTeaMaker> you can't change colors without doing maintenance
[4:54:16] <%DeathsDoom> pet the pokemon
[4:54:18] <Derkinstacker> you can change the color without maintancence.
[4:54:19] <+Jonesman64> BLOOBY SQUAD
[4:54:20] <KungFuStarfish> My only reference with platinum is nier and mgs which had some platforming which is why I asked lol
[4:54:21] <aliasz50> @louie_salmon im pretty sure twitter has nothing to do with the review bombing ,
[4:54:22] <Idon__> you can totally change colors without it
[4:54:25] <%dukenux> wtf
[4:54:26] <+corinv> You can defo change colour without cleaning them first
[4:54:30] <%dukenux> what pokemon is that
[4:54:30] <megaminimechamocha> I mean, non-fiction cops generally do suck, but video game cops aren't really a problem because video game cops actually serve the public interest and fight bad guys so whatever.
[4:54:34] <anuchallengertwitch> @Louie_Salmon Oh. That'll take getting use to when I eventually buy it.
[4:54:35] <+corinv> It's just kinda harder to tell what they look like
[4:54:36] <the__magic_conch> you can change colors, it just affect slight movement speed of legion
[4:54:37] <+McSnazzyPants> yes you can, it just makes it annoying since a;ll you se eis purple shit
[4:55:04] <%doc_ock_rokc> ITS PIKACHU!
[4:55:07] <Sphincter_Spelunker> It's Poseidon
[4:55:07] <+Pyroclase> oh my gosh they're so cute
[4:55:08] <%dukenux> well that one's lickitung obviously
[4:55:11] <%Keyd00d> hot takes in the chat
[4:55:16] <SlimeSlimeSlime> It's the Aloan version of the lava one.
[4:55:16] <%joylent_blue> the sheep frogs are back
[4:55:25] <InvaderKAZ> @megaminimechamocha Cops in media being competent is supposed to make you believe that real cops are competent too, not to say that this is the case in this game necessarily
[4:55:27] <%Louie_Salmon> @aliasz50 It definitely feels weird, but you can chain jump right to airborne enemies so it works out
[4:55:42] <hassanico1> @InvaderKAZ that's a ridiculous assertion
[4:55:44] <+CCCPKi> This game always sparks the stupidest discussion in chats, just watch the game you weirdos lmao
[4:55:47] <aliasz50> doesnt really matter , the game is based on japanese police not the american police
[4:55:52] <%miguelrod777> that river city girls ost is great benn playing abobos theme all day
[4:55:58] <UnfilteredComic> If and when they make a sequel to this game, theyre gonna include an element system like pokemon or spectrobes
[4:56:02] <+BeatBoxersDevMike> pat should equip a parry chip and go evo on em
[4:56:06] <hassanico1> Ugh you people are reminding of those waypoint fuckos boycotting this game
[4:56:09] <Huntercd> Are there tag attacks with the sister?
[4:56:11] <+VektorTroika> @CCCPKi Japanese Game Dev ACCIDENTALLY Makes Game About Thing Americans Bitch About!
[4:56:11] <megaminimechamocha> @InvaderKAZ I mean, the story seems to make it clear that Neuron ain't exactly on the up and up too, although I haven't beaten it yet
[4:56:11] <Zombrocom> This game brings out all the edgy 12 year olds LUL
[4:56:13] <%joylent_blue> LUL
[4:56:17] <Manjove> american Police arent even that bad, just the media overplaying the bad ones
[4:56:19] <%dukenux> The best representation of a competent cop in media has to be Nicolas Angel
[4:56:22] <waifoong98> ppl are taking media for real life now, really???
[4:56:22] <%dukenux> in Hot Fuzz
[4:56:24] <cureneckbeard> !uptime
[4:56:24] <@Moobot> I've been playing this game for how long? Oh only 4h 56m.
[4:56:26] <%joylent_blue> take that pic right as he shoulder checks you into oblivion
[4:56:32] <%doc_ock_rokc> Boo hoo someone doesn't like the cops because they don't let people riot in the streets
[4:56:37] <hassanico1> @megaminimechamocha Neuron also happens to be way more military/secret service anyway
[4:56:39] <InvaderKAZ> Yeah that's why I said that's not necessarily the case in this game, it's pretty removed from irl police
[4:56:45] <$GoogleyGareth> @dukenux Mornin angle
[4:56:46] <%dekkitout> If this game's sequels let you turn certain enemies in elemental Legions, I'd lose my marbles so hard
[4:56:47] <artificiallynatural> Also it's not like your cop is a fucking beacon of the law seeing as you break in to a restricted zone and draw the ire of mr evil man
[4:56:56] <%dukenux> @GoogleyGareth H-A-G
[4:56:58] <megaminimechamocha> @doc_ock_rokc please don't get emotional, we're talking about video games in this chat
[4:56:58] <KungFuStarfish> Back in my day cops just drove cars and slowly put the drunks in a room, these guys are crazy lol
[4:57:13] <%Louie_Salmon> This bickering over the specific type of cop representation doesn't matter, because "X is in Y, therefore X is bad" is inherently dumbass reasoning
[4:57:22] <$GoogleyGareth> @dukenux Mr P.I.Staker, pisstaker COME ON!
[4:57:26] <%miguelrod777> its just a goat sound effect LUL
[4:57:31] <%doc_ock_rokc> and you are trying to imply all cops are evil because of a few rare highprofile cases
[4:57:33] <%Louie_Salmon> therefore Y is bad, I mean
[4:57:34] <+McSnazzyPants> there was concept art of every enemy skeleton type having a legion
[4:57:42] <VJdarkworld> Judge Lappy is THE LAW CorgiDerp
[4:57:42] <Sphincter_Spelunker> no, seriously. I need to know what the ice Zeus' are called
[4:57:43] <+McSnazzyPants> i want a slime frog legion
[4:57:44] <%dukenux> @GoogleyGareth You mothers....
[4:57:51] <megaminimechamocha> I never said all cops are evil, I said these fictional cops are cool.
[4:57:51] <+JacktheMan18> 400+ damage crits Krreygasm Kreygasm
[4:57:55] <%joylent_blue> McSnazzyPants PogChamp nooooo don't tell me that
[4:57:58] <+Zeromaru2> I think it did LUL
[4:57:59] <vexion_smh> LUL
[4:57:59] <%Keyd00d> LUL
[4:58:00] <artificiallynatural> Ice zeuses are Hephaestus
[4:58:04] <Sheny> btw if you have camera problems you can just press r3 + dpad
[4:58:05] <hassanico1> @Louie_Salmon I think my favorite part was seeing "friend of the pocast" LKD throw their own parents under the bus for being cops just to shit on the game
[4:58:06] <vexion_smh> he totally did
[4:58:12] <%dekkitout> @McSnazzyPants I remember someone telling me in a prior stream, and every time I remember it, a part of me dies~
[4:58:13] <Zombrocom> @artificiallynatural That makes EVEN LESS sense!
[4:58:19] <+BeatBoxersDevMike> you can beat cerberus by slingshotting him off the ledge
[4:58:28] <SlimeSlimeSlime> S+ up in dis bitch!
[4:58:29] <Sphincter_Spelunker> @artificiallynatural That's sick!
[4:58:31] <hassanico1> Freaking Zeus frogs are so weird
[4:58:42] <artificiallynatural> I'm having a fucking go but that would be jsut as stupid as the Zeus name
[4:58:42] <+CCCPKi> This part LUL
[4:58:42] <+Jonesman64> this part sucks
[4:58:43] <%joylent_blue> oh boy this part
[4:58:45] <Ipsenscastle> The poor public opinion of the police is largely an American thing, it's bizarre to expect a Japanese game to take any of that into account. They're the good guys as far as most of the world is concerned
[4:58:48] <%Keyd00d> oh boy FUN
[4:58:50] <+JacktheMan18> I wish the switch would hurry up and have a price drop
[4:58:52] <%Louie_Salmon> @hassanico1 Oh boy. That and the persona article alone is enough to write them off forever
[4:58:53] <hassanico1> Do the Greek names have any rhyme or reason?

[4:58:59] <Sphincter_Spelunker> @Zombrocom Hephaestus was at least turned into a hideous creature
[4:59:02] <+BeatBoxersDevMike> she only has to do ONCE
[4:59:03] <%dukenux> A sea barrier?
[4:59:06] <+BeatBoxersDevMike> *ONE

[4:59:08] <haisho> of course Akira is the one to take care of the BIG OMINOUS GATE

[4:59:17] <+Felto3> all the gates are behind slide puzzles
[4:59:17] <+VektorTroika> @Ipsenscastle FINALLY someone gets it.
[4:59:23] <+Zeromaru2> Yep
[4:59:24] <vexion_smh> good fucking job sis

[4:59:29] <Idon__> welp
[4:59:30] <+JacktheMan18> LuL
[4:59:31] <%BestTeaMaker> LUL
[4:59:31] <+corinv> It can be 100%'d but it's kinda bullshit, some easy parts to miss
[4:59:32] <InvaderKAZ> Yeah I don't expect a platinum game to portray a super nuanced depiction of law enforcement lol
[4:59:33] <%miguelrod777> LUL
[4:59:35] <%dukenux> Is this like, close to the end of the game?
[4:59:40] <$GoogleyGareth> SourPls
[4:59:41] <+corinv> Sort of
[4:59:41] <anuchallengertwitch> Guess I'll Die
[4:59:43] <mayorrev> guess I'll die

[4:59:50] <%Keyd00d> SourPls BANGER
[4:59:52] <%Stay_Hydrated_Bot> @angriestpat stayhyBottle You've been live for just over 5 hours. By this point in your broadcast you should have consumed at least 20oz (600mL) of water to maintain optimum hydration.
[4:59:56] <megaminimechamocha> Pretty sure the Japanese police service has its own host of problems as well, that's the whole "100% conviction rate" issue
[4:59:56] <+lewdiversalPictures> sarueiDJ
[5:00:00] <Idon__> this one's a pain in the ASS
[5:00:02] <UnfilteredComic> Technically they are slide puzzles
[5:00:04] <%miguelrod777> Clearly sister is the superior fight taking on only one gatw
[5:00:04] <%Keyd00d> you were moving yourself
[5:00:05] <+CharredChord> That has been the case since forever
[5:00:08] <hassanico1> @megaminimechamocha that's more a legal thing
[5:00:11] <SlimeSlimeSlime> Dammit pat, drink water!
[5:00:14] <circular7> walking is hard for pat
[5:00:16] <al0nem0nster> hydrobot, that's new.

[5:00:28] <Idon__> WORTH IIIIIIT
[5:00:28] <vexion_smh> LUL
[5:00:28] <%joylent_blue> thats fine

[5:00:30] <+BeatBoxersDevMike> get ready for more of that
[5:00:32] <+Felto3> good trade
[5:00:33] <%supersugoisenpai1> Go get that red matter
[5:00:36] <Idon__> ya got it
[5:00:37] <hassanico1> @megaminimechamocha IIRC it's prosecutor's who'll go out of their way to help fabricate evidence
[5:00:38] <transporterthesequel> Wait this is timed?
[5:00:39] <Idon__> ya done
[5:00:41] <+CharredChord> better hurry
[5:00:48] <%kyh9> You’re almost done Pat.
[5:00:51] <+BeatBoxersDevMike> 10% done
[5:00:53] <SlimeSlimeSlime> Duck?
[5:00:56] <%joylent_blue> you might think you have a ton of time but you don't
[5:00:57] <%kyh9> Then chapter 9 Kino is yours
[5:01:13] <+McSnazzyPants> yes, use the slow moving one for timed cleanup
[5:01:15] <hassanico1> @kyh9 I really don't think we'll be getting that today
[5:01:17] <hassanico1> !uptime
[5:01:17] <@Moobot> I've been playing this game for how long? Oh only 5h 1m.
[5:01:18] <KungFuStarfish> Soo demons are standard police equipment here?
[5:01:23] <Sphincter_Spelunker> How many hours in and we've made no progress in finding out what Jena is doing or plot
[5:01:33] <hassanico1> There's only 3 levels after this though
[5:01:34] <al0nem0nster> Here's a counter argument, maybe instead of fiction tricking people into thinking the world is a certain way, when you portray something doing good in fiction it'sportraying how the world should be.
[5:01:34] <%joylent_blue> KungFuStarfish nah, your character is apart of a special task force
[5:01:42] <+ConLin_Arts_> oh so thaaaats where i missed some
[5:01:51] <@SSaryn> Ah fuck its that Dreaming City shit
[5:01:52] <KungFuStarfish> Ooh like a foxhound?
[5:02:01] <Idon__> LMAO
[5:02:01] <%doc_ock_rokc> @al0nem0nster that doesn't count unless the GLORIOUS REVOLUTION does it
[5:02:02] <+ConLin_Arts_> oooooh
[5:02:02] <%dekkitout> Shattered Throne?
[5:02:03] <SlimeSlimeSlime> Woah! Good sleuthing, I didn't get that one.
[5:02:07] <+Pyroclase> this totally is dreaming city shit
[5:02:13] <%joylent_blue> yeah like a foxhound
[5:02:21] <+BeatBoxersDevMike> ITS ONE GATE
[5:02:22] <KungFuStarfish> That’s cool
[5:02:23] <InvaderKAZ> @al0nem0nster It depends, for that to be the case it can't only show how the world should be, it also has to make a substantive criticism of the real world example to clarify that there is a problem.
[5:02:24] <%Typhaeon> That's what... she said?
[5:02:25] <hassanico1> @al0nem0nster damn, what a reasonable and well balanced take (automatically making it wrong /s)
[5:02:29] <%miguelrod777> thats what he said
[5:02:33] <Derkinstacker> nailed it
[5:02:36] <megaminimechamocha> @hassanico1 Look I'm not an expert, I'm just saying any country with a police service is going to have a lot of the same problems as any other country's service. It's not just glorious nippon land all the time.
[5:02:36] <+corinv> Parkour
[5:02:36] <Idon__> SourPls
[5:02:37] <SlimeSlimeSlime> Smooth
[5:02:38] <%joylent_blue> easy
[5:02:39] <%miguelrod777> nice
[5:02:42] <+exploitativity2> nice
[5:02:55] <hassanico1> @megaminimechamocha I wouldn't know, we don't have cops here. Just military.
[5:02:59] <Manjove> so, the sister is super evil right?
[5:03:07] <%doc_ock_rokc> @megaminimechamocha but you still want to shit on the game because cops
[5:03:07] <%corinv> corinv subscribed with Twitch Prime. 
[5:03:14] <%miguelrod777> nah she probably brainwashed evil
[5:03:14] <VJdarkworld> sister is super red
[5:03:15] <+BeatBoxersDevMike> still 10% done
[5:03:17] <haisho> wait this mission is timed?
[5:03:24] <megaminimechamocha> @doc_ock_rokc Dude what is your problem, I'm saying I like Astral Chain.
[5:03:28] <+exploitativity2> it's timed and we're not hitting 100%
[5:03:32] <+exploitativity2> no fucking way
[5:03:37] <KungFuStarfish> Sisters are normally evil irl my dear friend
[5:03:39] <hassanico1> Like, I've never seen a police officer, but I have seen many tanks and APCs show up to scenes of crimes and accidents
[5:03:46] <hassanico1> Kinda fucked up
[5:03:55] <megaminimechamocha> That does sound fucked, where are you from?
[5:03:56] <%joylent_blue> missed a part there
[5:03:57] <+BeatBoxersDevMike> oh wait, the cleanup is at the top
[5:04:02] <+ConLin_Arts_> PAT
[5:04:03] <hassanico1> @megaminimechamocha Lebanon
[5:04:07] <+ConLin_Arts_> You missed one
[5:04:09] <SlimeSlimeSlime> Use the dumbsters Pat!
[5:04:16] <%13ry4n93> this looks kinda tedious
[5:04:18] <megaminimechamocha> @hassanico1 Oof
[5:04:20] <+BeatBoxersDevMike> platforming in this game is great
[5:04:33] <megaminimechamocha> But PAT
[5:04:35] <megaminimechamocha> PROGRESS
[5:04:36] <SlimeSlimeSlime> Dammit
[5:04:40] <+ConLin_Arts_> Mind Gobbalins
[5:04:41] <Idon__> Pat this part is impossible without the dumpsters
[5:04:41] <Derkinstacker> arms can tank those
[5:04:45] <valriot> This part is AWFUL
[5:04:45] <%joylent_blue> fuck this part
[5:04:46] <hassanico1> @megaminimechamocha basically the ISF(internal security force) are a discount military
[5:04:47] <Idon__> I spent 4 minutes on this
[5:04:49] <Zaphire_Saucypants> god, that's annoying
[5:04:50] <Manjove> use the Zandatsu
[5:04:51] <Idon__> It's a pain in the ass
[5:04:53] <VJdarkworld> you can slice the ballz
[5:04:55] <+McSnazzyPants> super armor makes those gates a non-issue
[5:05:03] <artificiallynatural> Put your arms in front and let it eat those hits
[5:05:03] <KungFuStarfish> That looks super tedious
[5:05:04] <%skizzuto> I cheesed this super hard with super armor
[5:05:09] <SlimeSlimeSlime> Yes!
[5:05:09] <hassanico1> Ok I gotta say, the Gates spewing big dumb projectiles is reaaaally silly
[5:05:16] <+McSnazzyPants> nice dodge\
[5:05:23] <hassanico1> Did they even explain WHY Gates can shoot dumb block bombs?
[5:05:23] <megaminimechamocha> This seems like a pretty annoying section of this game
[5:05:25] <Idon__> NOOOOOOO
[5:05:26] <Sheny> it helps if you move your camera out
[5:05:32] <%corinv> Oh that's how you're supposed to do it
[5:05:34] <+Felto3> you can slash the bombs
[5:05:36] <Idon__> LUL
[5:05:36] <%corinv> I literally just let my legion eat the hits
[5:05:37] <SlimeSlimeSlime> Yeah, it resets =/
[5:05:39] <InvaderKAZ> This bit was impossible for me
[5:05:40] <%dekkitout> @hassanico1 Because videogame?
[5:05:40] <Zaphire_Saucypants> yyyup
[5:05:42] <Sphincter_Spelunker> no, you're pat
[5:05:45] <Derkinstacker> This is the last bad part of this mission.
[5:05:46] <%joylent_blue> apatBig annoyed
[5:05:46] <Idon__> Yeah I just said fuck this bit
[5:05:48] <VJdarkworld> use the raiden powers
[5:05:48] <+Jonesman64> i hate this mission
[5:05:49] <SlimeSlimeSlime> Hi Annoyed, I'm Slime.
[5:05:50] <+CCCPKi> @megaminimechamocha this is the only part like this and its really bad, I think a lot of people consider this the worst file in the game
[5:05:57] <%Keyd00d> use the other platform
[5:05:57] <KungFuStarfish> Christ I’m getting dmc4 Nero floating platforms syndrome now
[5:05:58] <al0nem0nster> can you push one may want to heal or somethign
[5:06:00] <%gunzerkingdunce> Yeah platforming starts to get annoying by this point
[5:06:01] <megaminimechamocha> Can't call it a Platinum Game without ANOTHER BULLSHIT JUMPING PUZZLE
[5:06:02] <%joylent_blue> honestly just do that
[5:06:02] <circular7> looks like pat being pat
[5:06:05] <%joylent_blue> fuck the dumpsters
[5:06:08] <jubejube56> If only there was a legion that could block all this bs...
[5:06:11] <%joylent_blue> you'll be faster that way
[5:06:12] <+exploitativity2> hit dat sync
[5:06:17] <ne0bunny> I hated this one, couldnt do it
[5:06:18] <%supersugoisenpai1> You can move the legion in front to tank those
[5:06:20] <Idon__> big give up machine
[5:06:20] <UnfilteredComic> I just had my legion tank them, use Arrow its the fastest
[5:06:25] <%miguelrod777> split it wide ipen
[5:06:28] <+BeatBoxersDevMike> 56% left, she's still on 1 gate
[5:06:34] <megaminimechamocha> cuz fuck
[5:06:34] <+BeatBoxersDevMike> *done
[5:06:38] <%corinv> Red matter is a fuck
[5:06:39] <al0nem0nster> oh literally ram your legion's face into them, yeah that might work.
[5:06:41] <+Risingxiv> use the Arm leigon as a shiled and place him so he eats the blasts
[5:06:44] <hassanico1> btw what the heck is this location anyway?
[5:06:50] <KungFuStarfish> If only we had umbra witch powers
[5:06:53] <TCCBros> Don't you need to pee?
[5:07:00] <hassanico1> I don't recognize that building from last level
[5:07:02] <liflamor> !uptime
[5:07:03] <@Moobot> I've been playing this game for how long? Oh only 5h 7m.
[5:07:03] <megaminimechamocha> Pat remember to piss
[5:07:10] <+VektorTroika> Maximum Legion
[5:07:11] <Huntercd> Elmo the dumpster cat
[5:07:22] <rosemon5001> puzzle too stronk must take anger out on weak doggos
[5:07:22] <Zaphire_Saucypants> that finisher is gonna eat up time if you aint careful
[5:07:25] <hassanico1> Can he fail this or does he just get a bad rank?
[5:07:31] <%BestTeaMaker> yeah right sis
[5:07:32] <+BeatBoxersDevMike> 1 gate
[5:07:34] <%joylent_blue> the beast legion even does that spinning sawblade attack Shadow has
[5:07:35] <megaminimechamocha> What if DLC story got released and it was just playing the game from your twin's perspective?
[5:07:41] <%dekkitout> Sure it is Akira....
[5:07:56] <Idon__> cut to akira relaxing in the astral plane drinking akali cola
[5:08:00] <SlimeSlimeSlime> Sometimes I look at pat, and the Buscemi face behind him gives me a right good scare.
[5:08:01] <+McSnazzyPants> @hassanico1 just ranking
[5:08:02] <skinmansgds> Beast Legion is more or less Bladewolf
[5:08:08] <skinmansgds> it even shares dome moves
[5:08:10] <KungFuStarfish> I’m sure pats a high ranking platinum pro player he’s got this
[5:08:16] <%dekkitout> *Smash cut to Akira back at the crib playing with all the cats*
[5:08:18] <Idon__> bladewolf + shadow + sif
[5:08:27] <%monaman1> monaman1 subscribed at Tier 1. 
[5:08:42] <SpellCatty> Does Beast Legion have any Ammy moves?
[5:08:45] <al0nem0nster> I fee like I've seen those salamander types in another game but I can't remember which.
[5:08:54] <%doc_ock_rokc> @Idon__ + That Dog
[5:08:58] <hassanico1> Yo Chat, what's the best item in this game Pat will never ever use since it's a consumable?
[5:09:01] <megaminimechamocha> I always feel like observations like that are a little silly.
[5:09:05] <KnightAsteran> you mean the flans?
[5:09:09] <+BeatBoxersDevMike> grenades
[5:09:10] <+Pyroclase> stream froze for me
[5:09:11] <al0nem0nster> probably any item that buffs attack.
[5:09:13] <TCCBros> Get some water and go pee dude
[5:09:19] <%corinv> Grenades are strong as fuck
[5:09:20] <+CharredChord> Lappy special
[5:09:24] <Dragovus> @AngriestPat Use Blade Mode with Sword to cut the big ball attacks
[5:09:27] <skinmansgds> Slime frogs are really unique looking, they don't share the same design elements as every other chimera
[5:09:29] <%joylent_blue> i mean, Ammy uses greatswords, so the dodge+sync attack is kinda an Ammy move
[5:09:32] <%BestTeaMaker> now do it pat
[5:09:34] <Derkinstacker> Grenades are broken.
[5:09:38] <haisho> now for the WORST puzzle
[5:09:52] <al0nem0nster> so someone said you can just headbut them with your legion
[5:09:55] <SlimeSlimeSlime> Shove the dumpsters right up to the portal's face
[5:10:00] <megaminimechamocha> Like, Platinum is a game company that makes action games, how many cool designs and attacks can you make for something dog shaped? Just because it has dumb shoulder pads and holds the sword in it's mouth doesn't make it automatically "just Bladewolf"
[5:10:01] <+BeatBoxersDevMike> but pat wont buy a single vendor drink i bet, cuz temp buffs
[5:10:03] <KnightAsteran> @al0nem0nster you can
[5:10:07] <waifoong98> LUL
[5:10:09] <KnightAsteran> it's how I do it
[5:10:10] <+McSnazzyPants> wait they just clip into each other lmao
[5:10:11] <megaminimechamocha> Although, yes, that's definitely very Bladewolf
[5:10:15] <al0nem0nster> well yeah the chain's only so long
[5:10:15] <%dukenux> It's easy
[5:10:17] <WRFWD> I didn't even move the box
[5:10:19] <Idon__> ahahahahaha
[5:10:22] <Idon__> this part sucks
[5:10:25] <%dukenux> Just pull yourself by your bootstraps
[5:10:27] <%dukenux> 4Head
[5:10:28] <%RedKnightVI> Oh christ, fuck this challenge in particular -.-
[5:10:28] <%BestTeaMaker> LUL
[5:10:29] <KungFuStarfish> Not gonna lie, I’m a lil frustrated seeing this design
[5:10:30] <Sphincter_Spelunker> just phase right through it
[5:10:32] <+Zeromaru2> You've had that happen to you more than once her
[5:10:33] <%joylent_blue> monkaS
[5:10:39] <al0nem0nster> oh the platforms can faze through each other, that's a game changer
[5:10:42] <SlimeSlimeSlime> NICE!
[5:10:42] <qo_op> push the blocks pat. do it you gamer
[5:10:53] <%joylent_blue> just a minute left nbd
[5:10:56] <+BeatBoxersDevMike> 40 seconds

[5:11:03] <Sphincter_Spelunker> 40 seconds monkaS
[5:11:05] <hassanico1> He's gonna fail
[5:11:05] <KnightAsteran> literally just have the legion tank the blocks, it's way easier
[5:11:18] <+Risingxiv> yes let the legion tank
[5:11:23] <%dukenux> 20s
[5:11:25] <Zaphire_Saucypants> oh shit can he do it

[5:16:32] <KungFuStarfish> Bonjour cat being
[5:16:39] <megaminimechamocha> Anyways, Astral Chain is cool but even this MC Cop has already used their Legion on common criminals, which while arguably justifiable in self defense in some instances, we can all agree that an invisible sword monster is a *bit* over the line, and that is basically a case of police brutality waiting to happen.
[5:16:42] <+BeatBoxersDevMike> elmo jealous of beast legion

[5:18:37] <Sokumotanaka> Man fuck Caesar's legion assassins; they're super annoying cause when they come around they destroy the frame rate (cause they love to attack where there are alot of npcs) so I wanna kill them quickly so I can play the game at a normal rate and not at a choppy snails pace.

[5:24:23] <%Keyd00d> yeah, safe
[5:24:29] <+BeatBoxersDevMike> now you gotta get back to the start i guess
[5:24:36] <%Keyd00d> you have to use a variety of skills
[5:24:48] <skinmansgds> The ranking just counts how much stuff you do and how fast you do it
[5:24:50] <+McSnazzyPants> i can't handle having the minimap rotate like that, especially in here
[5:24:51] <+Pendragwn> @AngriestPat Does the game get even more anime as it goes on
[5:24:53] <+exploitativity2> the ranking in this game depends more on what shit you do than how well you do
[5:24:54] <Manjove> thanks for the perfect map in this maze
[5:24:55] <haisho> forgot to track
[5:24:55] <%DeathsDoom> @ConLin_Arts_ its all about variance do everything switch legions such
[5:25:00] <+exploitativity2> taking damage doesn't lower your rank like it does in DMC
[5:25:01] <%Louie_Salmon> @conlin_arts_ There's a help menu that explains it, basically variety is all that matters
[5:25:02] <+ConLin_Arts_> it is so weird
[5:25:03] <+harrisboe> @pendragwn Heck yes it does

[5:25:55] <%Louie_Salmon> Damn those beast legion colors are great
[5:26:05] <%Louie_Salmon> Even though it's just all black and a little red
[5:26:20] <waifoong98> what's this, minesweeper?
[5:26:26] <+Pyroclase> I'm debating watching MST3K
[5:26:26] <%DeathsDoom> black and red are always good colors
[5:26:29] <SlimeSlimeSlime> Two of those guys got splattered right up against the wall.
[5:26:29] <thebiganxiety> Yo what did i miss?
[5:26:36] <%skizzuto> @Louie_Salmon I agree wholeheartedly. I've got the same colors on mine but green instead of red

[5:27:23] <megaminimechamocha> Pat how can you fight against the Chimeras when they clearly just want to EXPUNGE humanity's FILTH from this earth?
[5:27:34] <al0nem0nster> It's called a stand, because it kills everything as you stand around doing nothing.
[5:27:34] <%SkutgruzzWarshredda> Beast is good boi
[5:27:57] <%Scrub_Seeker> @exploitativity2 that bot was here last astral chain stream, block em and report em

[5:32:24] <%Scrub_Seeker> kinda odd that the trap led to MORE treasure
[5:32:29] <haisho> You grew too confident
[5:32:54] <al0nem0nster> well apparently the hellspawn that constructed this dimension were nice enough to incude consolation prizes.

[5:42:38] <%skizzuto> It's not without its flaws, but the gameplay is quite satisfying
[5:42:53] <$Hommando> This area doesn't look very fun.
[5:43:02] <Ralfclogs> It's exclusive because Nintendo payed for it

[5:43:20] <waifoong98> LUL
[5:43:23] <+BeatBoxersDevMike> gotta break up the pacing between high action fights
[5:43:24] <Manjove> LOL
[5:43:35] <Derkinstacker> You have a platform RIGHT there
[5:43:41] <al0nem0nster> seems easy enough.
[5:43:43] <%RubberFistFight> @AngriestPat I'm doin good SeemsGood although I was up til 1am and spent 12 hours yesterday trying to find a fucking 3-star badger for a perfect badger pelt in RDR2. Holy shit the hunting in that game is a fucken chore.

[5:44:18] <waifoong98> LUL again
[5:44:20] <Derkinstacker> You knew that!
[5:44:23] <al0nem0nster> gotta be more careful
[5:44:26] <artificiallynatural> Is Paige contagious or something
[5:44:27] <+VektorTroika> Gravity happens
[5:44:28] <+BeatBoxersDevMike> you can let go of right stick
[5:44:29] <%Louie_Salmon> @hassanico1 But what if he needs them later
[5:44:32] <%Keyd00d> don't be too rough
[5:44:34] <%Typhaeon> Bad slave, no....
[5:44:43] <%Typhaeon> Uh, what do you even incentivize an insane monster with

[5:44:51] <al0nem0nster> more souls.
[5:44:53] <artificiallynatural> with your chain
[5:44:56] <Manjove> scoobby snacks
[5:44:57] <%arancet> lack of pain
[5:44:59] <ShichiNoBushi> IRIS also reveals what is manipulated by what.
[5:45:02] <SlimeSlimeSlime> The ability to kill things.
[5:45:06] <al0nem0nster> or in this case red matter cores.
[5:45:15] <%doc_ock_rokc> @Typhaeon if its beast you incentivise it with belly rubs
[5:45:16] <%rumtumtugnutz> Big stumbo
[5:45:19] <%floralkami> Show your slave some respect, Pat!!
[5:45:25] <%Louie_Salmon> @typhaeon Freedom? Wait, we can't actually give it that. Well, we could, be we're not going to.
[5:45:39] <WhereIsWill> big anime man
[5:45:45] <%rumtumtugnutz> Yes. "Cool."
[5:45:51] <ShichiNoBushi> It's all a ruse.
[5:45:53] <al0nem0nster> Wonder if in the sequel you just straight up fuse with your stand.
[5:45:58] <%Typhaeon> I mean Beast doesn't seem as pissed and noncompliant as Arms & Sword Man do
[5:46:04] <+BeatBoxersDevMike> if only you had a way to block all this
[5:46:05] <%Typhaeon> LuL
[5:46:07] <Strider222> hahaha

[5:46:30] <%rumtumtugnutz> No Axe Cop yet

[5:47:16] <haisho> is it slide puzzle time?
[5:47:19] <Manjove> everything
[5:47:19] <al0nem0nster> If you wear the Pat skin you take active damage during the entire match.
[5:47:20] <%Scrub_Seeker> @doc_ock_rokc i think she got pulled past it all by axe legion
[5:47:22] <%dukenux> (i just watched the latest BOTW episode with Twisted Pair, before this)
[5:47:22] <%rumtumtugnutz> Akira is red Cop, and therefore probably big secret evil.

[5:49:54] <gryffinp> The other ones did not have their chain on
[5:49:54] <Derkinstacker> Dad re-caught it at some point.
[5:49:56] <al0nem0nster> so he managed to get the chain back on it, then lost the device itself.
[5:49:57] <%Shadicara> DAYUD
[5:50:00] <%dukenux> @floralkami it's "Best of the Worst" which is a yt series thats basicly four guys riffing on awful movies
[5:50:00] <skinmansgds> Looks like Max tried re-leashing it at some point
[5:50:00] <%Keyd00d> great pic
[5:50:02] <+harrisboe> 🦀 Dad’s Dead 🦀
[5:50:03] <%Louie_Salmon> And it definitely broke the chain before, so Max did some shit

[5:57:51] <Valdorick> "Look guys, intrimentality is really going to suck. Tits are going to grow out of the walls, and its going to be rad for 5 seconds, but then you turn into goo. Yoseph is a fuck." Bam, better speech
[5:57:53] <+ProtagonistJake> HE PISSED ON MY FUCKING LEGION

[5:57:58] <ShichiNoBushi> What about 30 - 33?
[5:58:02] <al0nem0nster> "The leader of Nueron is evil, My proof is a picture of his face, and that his name is Yoseph."
[5:58:04] <%doc_ock_rokc> @SpellCatty He told that his legion was THIS BIG

[5:59:21] <%miguelrod777> not very cash money of you
[5:59:22] <+BeatBoxersDevMike> [Pet Shop]
[5:59:24] <+VektorTroika> To this moment, the best moment in the playthrough has been you reacting in violent disgust to the perching raven cosmetic
[5:59:27] <al0nem0nster> might as well just cosplay as a man in black with those.
[5:59:28] <%dukenux> boomer shades
[5:59:31] <mayorrev> BAYO GLASSES??
[5:59:32] <%rdark_ksu> eyepatch it

[5:59:41] <%dukenux> no not that one
[5:59:41] <Pyrenity> Those are nier automata glasses
[5:59:42] <gryffinp> I like how woolie and pat have taken two different angles to making their manmcs look like absolute douchebags
[5:59:43] <%sentientvin> noooo
[5:59:45] <+temporal_zenith> @BeatBoxersDevMike [Pat Shop]
[5:59:45] <SlimeSlimeSlime> Oh hey, its Billy!
[5:59:49] <%Stay_Hydrated_Bot> @angriestpat stayhyBottle You've been live for just over 6 hours. By this point in your broadcast you should have consumed at least 24oz (720mL) of water to maintain optimum hydration.
[5:59:50] <%Shadicara> Become as lappy
[5:59:51] <Valdorick> You're trying so hard to become your sister, bro.
[5:59:52] <%InugamiTheHound> pat looks like Cole from InFamous 1
[5:59:52] <waifoong98> So dirtyyy
[5:59:52] <+Estuko> @Louie_Salmon we have to make sacrifices in our fun sometimes FeelsBadMan
[5:59:56] <tequilazaku> i van hardly belive how much better your character looks without the hat
[6:00:01] <hassanico1> Chat why is it called Axe?
[6:00:03] <a_mad_dragon> how does a jaw that small not shatter after one bite of something mildly chewy
[6:00:03] <+Estuko> @Valdorick I think there's a tag for that
[6:00:07] <hassanico1> It clearly is not an axe
[6:00:10] <%Shadicara> Because it has a giant axe
[6:00:10] <%TheBitingIrish> Damn Pat, going the distance today?
[6:00:12] <+ProtagonistJake> Your legions are cleaner than Jenda
[6:00:12] <%Typhaeon> He hates being dirty and hates not being dirty, he's like a cat
[6:00:12] <+BeatBoxersDevMike> its the switch axe from monster hunter
[6:00:13] <blackorchidKI2> That does not look like an axe.
[6:00:13] <%BestTeaMaker> the axeblade is long
[6:00:16] <%BestTeaMaker> it's still an axe
[6:00:18] <vexion_smh> oooohhhh
[6:00:19] <%doc_ock_rokc> @hassanico1 because Great sword is to long
[6:00:20] <%Keyd00d> ooooh
[6:00:21] <%dukenux> its along axe
[6:00:21] <LoneFonte> DO IT
[6:00:21] <%joylent_blue> that ones great
[6:00:21] <sonicluigi123> Maybe cause it's a two handed weapon
[6:00:22] <+harrisboe> @hassanico1 Because it smells like a middle school locker room
[6:00:22] <SpellCatty> Stylish!
[6:00:22] <%BestTeaMaker> it's more like a bardiche
[6:00:23] <%dukenux> yea
[6:00:25] <%miguelrod777> sleek
[6:00:25] <al0nem0nster> Just call him "BUSTER LEGION." sounds cooler, and is more accurate.
[6:00:26] <Tucker0603> that's cool
[6:00:26] <%dukenux> looks neat
[6:00:27] <+CaptainGrime> @blackorchidKI2 that is an axe......
[6:00:27] <sonicluigi123> Heavy hitter
[6:00:28] <gryffinp> Oh I haven't seen that one
[6:00:33] <%SGrim> Iron Warriors?
[6:00:34] <%thefishofwar> it's called axe because of its love of body spray
[6:00:36] <%Typhaeon> Go poleaxe some fools
[6:00:39] <hassanico1> What's the name in Japanese?
[6:00:44] <+harrisboe> That’s what I have for my axe legion
[6:00:44] <%skizzuto> the one you missed is the one I use lol
[6:00:47] <%dukenux> its like Cerberus armor colors
[6:00:54] <%dekkitout> Have them color coded like a sentai team
[6:00:56] <blackorchidKI2> @CaptainGrime If you squint your eyes, maybe.
[6:00:57] <+Estuko> no clean?
[6:00:57] <Valdorick> @Estuko something something Inset, something something about a phone?
[6:00:57] <ShichiNoBushi> Not going to groom your stands?
[6:00:59] <%RubberFistFight> @hassanico1 "naruhodo mamoru keikaku"
[6:00:59] <%Louie_Salmon> Does maintenance actually do anything?
[6:01:01] <SlimeSlimeSlime> You don't wanna clean your good bois?
[6:01:06] <goddamndavid> those guys really dont like being captured
[6:01:07] <%skizzuto> same as your current one but green instead of red
[6:01:07] <+Estuko> @Valdorick NotLikeThis uh
[6:01:10] <+VektorTroika> @dekkitout A Wonderful idea
[6:01:15] <%Keyd00d> SHIELD
[6:01:16] <mayorrev> SHIELD!
[6:01:17] <sonicluigi123> Yuuuuup
[6:01:17] <%skizzuto> black and green
[6:01:18] <%Shadicara> Big barrier
[6:01:19] <gryffinp> Axe is a lot more chill about it than most of them
[6:01:22] <%joylent_blue> Axe is fucking great
[6:01:22] <ZeSmexyHabib> You can now literally get rid of every other legion now that you have Axe LUL
[6:01:23] <%Keyd00d> Press L1
[6:01:24] <+VektorTroika> BIG MAN STRONG WEAPON
[6:01:25] <WhereIsWill> BIG SHIELD
[6:01:25] <gryffinp> He just kinda shuffles a bit
[6:01:25] <%doc_ock_rokc> Max liked to PROTECT
[6:01:25] <%RubberFistFight> DROP YOUR FUCKING SHIELD
[6:01:26] <%Louie_Salmon> Oh so he just has that
[6:01:30] <vexion_smh> YOOOOO
[6:01:31] <Tucker0603> BIG PALADIN BOIS
[6:01:32] <sonicluigi123> AXE is your Tank and shield
[6:01:33] <%dukenux> PogChamp
[6:01:35] <Derkinstacker> LZ LR LZ after combo with cleaver.
[6:01:36] <gooeychild> Pogu
[6:01:37] <%Keyd00d> TORNADO
[6:01:38] <%joylent_blue> he's also SLOW AS FUCK!
[6:01:39] <%Typhaeon> Oh that's sick
[6:01:39] <+BeatBoxersDevMike> it does big damage
[6:01:39] <+CaptainGrime> @blackorchidKI2 gota turn it at a 60 degree angle too
[6:01:39] <Derkinstacker> RZ
[6:01:43] <%Shadicara> Goodbye sword legion
[6:01:43] <nevan0> YO
[6:01:44] <+Estuko> Woah
[6:01:45] <%NeroInfinite> Axe is your tanky guy
[6:01:45] <LoneFonte> damn
[6:01:47] <Derkinstacker> LZ RZ LZ
[6:01:50] <sonicluigi123> VERY cool
[6:01:53] <%TheBitingIrish> Axe is the probably the oldest legion
[6:01:54] <+BeatBoxersDevMike> the shield breaks enemy attacks automatically
[6:01:54] <%poseidon2> poseidon2 subscribed with Twitch Prime. They've subscribed for 13 months, currently on a 1 month streak! 
[6:01:54] <+harrisboe> Axe legion is slow as shit though
[6:01:56] <%Typhaeon> Does this mean you are now Axe Cop
[6:01:58] <Zaphire_Saucypants> get that blue shield skill tho
[6:01:58] <haisho> might as well call it Dark Knight
[6:02:02] <Derkinstacker> Cleaver
[6:02:03] <agumon9000> @AngriestPat since I missed the stream what were your thoughts on the Kyle boss?
[6:02:06] <%Keyd00d> greatsword
[6:02:06] <%miguelrod777> do gun sync
[6:02:07] <+VektorTroika> Slow swings just means you get MORE HITSTUN
[6:02:08] <%Shadicara> Oh man AXE COP
[6:02:09] <TioXyco> but that's not an axe, that's a Greatsword
[6:02:09] <%skizzuto> @AngriestPat the sync attack combo after your basic combo in gladius mode does BIG damage with axe legion
[6:02:11] <mayorrev> it explodes
[6:02:16] <agumon9000> also better to ask after once your feelings have settled
[6:02:16] <sonicluigi123> You can stick the sword in the ground
[6:02:20] <TioXyco> or metal popsicle
[6:02:22] <Derkinstacker> That combos
[6:02:22] <waifoong98> DOPE
[6:02:23] <%Keyd00d> YE
[6:02:24] <SlimeSlimeSlime> Yeah!
[6:02:24] <%joylent_blue> RIGHT
[6:02:26] <%doc_ock_rokc> @TioXyco shut up though
[6:02:27] <Sphincter_Spelunker> STREAK
[6:02:27] <sonicluigi123> mhm
[6:02:28] <%skizzuto> you can keep going with that one
[6:02:30] <%Shadicara> Big fat range on the sword
[6:02:31] <+ProtagonistJake> you can keep going with tgreat sword combo
[6:02:32] <Tucker0603> FUCK YEAH
[6:02:37] <skinmansgds> Axe has the best attack and defense
[6:02:38] <+Darren716> X STRIKE
[6:02:39] <jubejube56> He has more exstensions off gladius
[6:02:42] <TioXyco> @doc_ock_rokc D: no need to be like that, geez
[6:02:43] <al0nem0nster> someone said you can keep going with the greatsword combo?
[6:02:43] <doggieo> That wasnt the whole combo
[6:02:44] <sonicluigi123> Axe is soooooo good
[6:02:47] <skinmansgds> The block it does is ACTUALLY useful
[6:02:48] <Zaphire_Saucypants> keep going with the gladius
[6:02:51] <%Shadicara> Upgrade that shit pat
[6:02:52] <+McSnazzyPants> that second loop sticks on bomb into enemies
[6:02:52] <%TheBitingIrish> How many baton/Legatus upgrades are there?
[6:02:55] <Blank9> axe hits so hard
[6:02:55] <%Shadicara> Give him cool moves
[6:02:56] <+BeatBoxersDevMike> he protecc and attacc
[6:02:57] <%Keyd00d> YES
[6:03:00] <%doc_ock_rokc> @TioXyco I do it as a joke
[6:03:08] <SlimeSlimeSlime> Synchronized movements are awesome, just like when the twins did that Power Rangers morphin' time shit at the start of the game, too cool.
[6:03:08] <doggieo> Love
[6:03:08] <%joylent_blue> SMOKIN'
[6:03:10] <%joylent_blue> SEXY
[6:03:12] <%joylent_blue> STYLE
[6:03:14] <Tucker0603> YEYEYEYEYEYEYEYEYE
[6:03:14] <mayorrev> JACKPOT
[6:03:14] <Derkinstacker> Yeah, BIG damage., combine it with blue shield, and no one can interrupt you.
[6:03:16] <ShichiNoBushi> And leaves a mine or something.
[6:03:19] <haisho> if I said Double Bloodspiller would that make sense?
[6:03:19] <waifoong98> Now that's just Sundowner Scissors lol
[6:03:22] <PrimeNeverproc> ssss
[6:03:25] <WhereIsWill> those gonna be all about the BIG NUMBER
[6:03:25] <Zaphire_Saucypants> explosive charges
[6:03:27] <gryffinp> I love tactical movement too much to focus on axe a lot but he's definitely super sick
[6:03:31] <%doc_ock_rokc> @waifoong98 but good
[6:03:31] <%dukenux> @waifoong98 was thinking the same
[6:03:32] <%Keyd00d> that thing explodes
[6:03:39] <Sphincter_Spelunker> Friendship ended with all other Legions. Axe Legion is my new best friend
[6:03:39] <waifoong98> @doc_ock_rokc true lol
[6:03:43] <+hazzy_o7> charge blaster
[6:03:44] <%dukenux> those this look more satysfying to use
[6:03:46] <%miguelrod777> its has delyed explosions
[6:03:49] <al0nem0nster> might as well.
[6:03:50] <%Shadicara> We've learned that all other stands can now do one
[6:03:50] <%Eaglestrike117> @AngriestPat You should go look at Axe's grid, its has one of the best skills in the game
[6:03:51] <%joylent_blue> apatBig JUICE
[6:03:52] <Tucker0603> upgrade
[6:03:52] <Zaphire_Saucypants> time to upgrade skills baby
[6:03:55] <Blank9> basic move is mash gladius out because damn it's so cool
[6:03:57] <%Louie_Salmon> What about L?
[6:03:58] <+Felto3> blue shield is amazing
[6:04:03] <sonicluigi123> Upgrading time
[6:04:08] <hellfirejefe> why is axe legion so cool
[6:04:12] <%joylent_blue> B L U E S H I E L D
[6:04:15] <Blank9> blue shield is one of the best skills
[6:04:16] <%Keyd00d> greatsword block
[6:04:18] <Derkinstacker> Just blocks everything
[6:04:21] <sonicluigi123> THERE WE GO
[6:04:21] <+BeatBoxersDevMike> yep
[6:04:22] <Finaldragoon> @AngriestPat L is a Parry Stance
[6:04:23] <%Shadicara> Yes and explodes
[6:04:24] <+BeatBoxersDevMike> blocks everything
[6:04:24] <gryffinp> @hellfirejefe Because he was your dad's stand
[6:04:25] <%Typhaeon> Looks like a mine
[6:04:25] <blackorchidKI2> Should've called it Berzerker Legion
[6:04:25] <%dekkitout> I really hope Axe Legion has a finisher that just changing its weapon into a switch axe
[6:04:26] <Tucker0603> YEYEYE
[6:04:26] <Zaphire_Saucypants> it parries damage
[6:04:31] <%BestTeaMaker> @AngriestPat that has a special parry dodge
[6:04:31] <sonicluigi123> Best one
[6:04:32] <+BeatBoxersDevMike> it does not parry
[6:04:34] <agumon9000> @AngriestPat If you want to perfect defense every fight in the game. Use blue shield and put as many cool down reduction chips on him
[6:04:34] <%cylish> its a shield
[6:04:34] <Zaphire_Saucypants> at the cost of energy
[6:04:36] <Derkinstacker> L is pure defence
[6:04:38] <WRFWD> L protects against harm, you can move through fire and poison
[6:04:39] <%Nope80808> itsa mine
[6:04:41] <%redrins> you can walk over fire with it
[6:04:41] <%skizzuto> guard stance, counters attacks at the cost of energy
[6:04:42] <%PaleBloodInk> Can you pick it up with Arm Legion?
[6:04:43] <skinmansgds> The shield will continue to block until you're out of legion juice
[6:04:44] <%shurtal> raw doggin' that parry
[6:04:45] <al0nem0nster> you've unlocked "Royal Guardian."
[6:04:47] <%BestTeaMaker> it has a REALLY strong sync attack
[6:04:49] <%BestTeaMaker> when you use it
[6:04:53] <+BeatBoxersDevMike> its a guard shield, the standard shield is a parry
[6:04:54] <Tucker0603> BEST LEGION
[6:04:56] <%Gogogolem> This giant police Guts swor
[6:04:57] <%Eaglestrike117> it blocks projectiles and stays like that till outta juice
[6:04:58] <Derkinstacker> all his attack combos leave that blue thing behind, just raw aoe damage for free..
[6:04:58] <ne0bunny> lets you walk through fire and gas
[6:05:01] <haisho> it eats your legion juice like crazy
[6:05:02] <ZeSmexyHabib> Perfect call is more or less a parry
[6:05:09] <+BeatBoxersDevMike> theres an achievement for doing 10 parries with the parry chip equipped on axe legion
[6:05:13] <+ConLin_Arts_> huh, maybe I should use Axe Cop more, usually use Sword
[6:05:15] <Finaldragoon> BLUE SHIELD
[6:05:18] <%skizzuto> that's a very good skill
[6:05:18] <+Estuko> So now we have Daddy Legion
[6:05:19] <gryffinp> You don't need the parry chip
[6:05:19] <artificiallynatural> summon shield
[6:05:19] <%Typhaeon> It's like you're force feeding your Legion when you level it up
[6:05:21] <%Keyd00d> it's good
[6:05:21] <%joylent_blue> Axe's perfect call is the sickest
[6:05:23] <Derkinstacker> Blue shield is the best.
[6:05:24] <%supersugoisenpai1> You can look at the help menu for the perfect dodge attack
[6:05:26] <%DeathsDoom> hes so slow tho
[6:05:26] <+CharredChord> 3 free hits
[6:05:26] <gryffinp> I got that order completion without parry chips
[6:05:26] <Rada150> they call that an axe? that's a broadswod
[6:05:30] <%BestTeaMaker> blue shield lets you get 3 free hits
[6:05:30] <Blank9> blue shield is negating damage for 3 hits entirely
[6:05:38] <+Darren716> Blue shield is so dope
[6:05:38] <%Typhaeon> next thing you know you'll be eating Axe Pate.
[6:05:41] <+Felto3> blue shield is just the butterflies from bayo
[6:05:42] <Derkinstacker> Get autobind or speedstar with him
[6:05:45] <Derkinstacker> he moves slow as hell.
[6:05:45] <%doc_ock_rokc> He protec and he attac but most improtantly he is stac...ed
[6:05:47] <gryffinp> Yeah, that perfect call animation right there in the video
[6:05:50] <gryffinp> that's the shit
[6:05:51] <+kraajkase> This shit seems super OP
[6:05:53] <agumon9000> @AngriestPat Blue Shield just negates the next three times you would be hit while they are up. Stack as many cool down reduction chips on Axe boi
[6:05:54] <al0nem0nster> Remember, the first introduction we had to this legion, was it crushing another's windpipe with its bear hands.
[6:05:55] <%13ry4n93> @Rada150 axe legion told them to call it an axe and nobody argues with with him
[6:05:56] <%Eaglestrike117> yeah blue shield is *Nah fuck your hit IM GONNA KILL COMIN"
[6:06:04] <waifoong98> Wow, it is just SwitchAxe in sword mode LUL
[6:06:05] <%BestTeaMaker> the chain bind is a good one
[6:06:15] <%skizzuto> I also like auto-bind on him because he's so slow otherwise
[6:06:17] <%joylent_blue> oh shit i didn't realize you were fucking rich lol
[6:06:18] <%BestTeaMaker> axe legion is basically BIG BOI DAMAGE
[6:06:22] <%shurtal> Axe Body Spray Legion
[6:06:28] <%TheBitingIrish> Where'd he grind?
[6:06:33] <%Shadicara> apatBig apatBig apatBig
[6:06:34] <PrimeNeverproc> when you fill skill board, does it become b1?
[6:06:35] <%doc_ock_rokc> @joylent_blue pat has be SAVING for this
[6:06:36] <Zaphire_Saucypants> I believe the left unlocokable is good
[6:06:36] <%Typhaeon> All he needs now is a dunk move like the real Axe
[6:06:39] <Strider222> axe boi deserves to be strong!
[6:06:39] <%13ry4n93> is axe the black iron tarkus of astral chain?
[6:06:41] <liflamor> Axe Legion looks like its rocking out on a guitar
[6:06:42] <%supersugoisenpai1> Biggest downside is axe legion is slow as shit
[6:06:49] <Zaphire_Saucypants> good skill called...crash bomb, I think?
[6:06:53] <%joylent_blue> yeah he's a snail
[6:06:59] <skinmansgds> Yeah, Crash Bomb
[6:07:00] <+Darren716> Yeah good luck chaining people with Axe
[6:07:03] <ZeSmexyHabib> @supersugoisenpai1 Which is why Arrrow + Axe is legit all you need in this game LuL
[6:07:03] <%TheBitingIrish> Slower than ARM? WutFace
[6:07:05] <Rada150> i wish there were more legion types like a smaller variant of the harpy boss and maybe like a burrowing type that attacks from underground and turns into a drill
[6:07:06] <%Shadicara> Doesn't matter if they die in two hits though
[6:07:07] <Derkinstacker> He will stay in defensive unless you use LZ to send him out, he's not auto like the rest.
[6:07:14] <+Darren716> Better to just let him free and use beast to chain them up
[6:07:14] <hassanico1> Axe Legion is Crash Man?
[6:07:17] <skinmansgds> Speed Star will negate the slowness for a bit
[6:07:21] <+McSnazzyPants> i usually have blue shield and speed star
[6:07:21] <Tucker0603> GO ALL IN WITH AXE
[6:07:22] <%Keyd00d> me 2
[6:07:22] <gryffinp> You're running a bit low on gene juice
[6:07:25] <%dekkitout> Was the hit rush just MH wild swing
[6:07:25] <%BestTeaMaker> big damage with big booms
[6:07:30] <+BeatBoxersDevMike> yep
[6:07:33] <sonicluigi123> Axe Legion is the tank of the party
[6:07:34] <+ConLin_Arts_> Go all out on him
[6:07:36] <agumon9000> @AngriestPat Put as many cool down reduction ability chips on him
[6:07:38] <%joylent_blue> @AngriestPat you can even tell him to guard NPCs who have health bars
[6:07:38] <%dukenux> As you can see
[6:07:41] <Derkinstacker> Tank and biggest dick dps.
[6:07:42] <Zaphire_Saucypants> voids fire and poison damage
[6:07:42] <%Typhaeon> He's even cooler than Beast
[6:07:44] <Rada150> he is the literal stand of all the legions
[6:07:44] <+ConLin_Arts_> you will go all out one day on a legion
[6:07:45] <Blank9> he's all about tanking and damage
[6:07:45] <Finaldragoon> don't forget to assign skills
[6:07:46] <%skizzuto> he's good for just mashing zr because his shield will protect you from stray hits
[6:07:47] <al0nem0nster> might as well try him out in the training terminal now
[6:07:47] <agumon9000> His abilities are busted but have really long cool downs
[6:07:48] <Strider222> hi holo lappy
[6:07:52] <Blank9> not so much chains
[6:07:53] <hassanico1> @AngriestPat equip skills on him?
[6:07:55] <+ProtagonistJake> use his l1 dodge its great
[6:07:58] <Derkinstacker> The barrier he keeps around you in defensive can parry some attacks until it breaks.
[6:08:03] <al0nem0nster> put on some abilities and chips?
[6:08:11] <%Big_Dream> blue shield
[6:08:16] <powerprotoman> now do 5 hit rushes in a row
[6:08:16] <%decisivelynameless> Hit rush is way too good imo
[6:08:26] <Blank9> blue shield is 3 free hits straight up
[6:08:26] <agumon9000> @AngriestPat Cooldown reduction on him
[6:08:27] <al0nem0nster> whoever said to do 5 hit rushes at once is right.
[6:08:36] <Zaphire_Saucypants> too bad you cant
[6:08:38] <%joylent_blue> oh my god you have so many chips
[6:08:39] <lionmanguy> Welp, gotta head out early to get to dinner, see ya around later
[6:08:41] <Zaphire_Saucypants> they just replace each other
[6:08:46] <waifoong98> SPEED?
[6:08:51] <al0nem0nster> well that's dissapointing.
[6:08:57] <sonicluigi123> wellp
[6:08:59] <skinmansgds> That's an aaaaaaaaaaaaaalie
[6:08:59] <+BeatBoxersDevMike> there's an achievement for 10 parries with a parry chip equipped on axe legion
[6:09:05] <%skizzuto> legion speed isn't a bad idea either
[6:09:08] <Sphincter_Spelunker> Time to grind off stream
[6:09:10] <gryffinp> Again, you don't need a parry chip
[6:09:15] <gryffinp> You can just use axe's natural parries
[6:09:19] <Derkinstacker> Speedstar or autobind are suggested, just cause he's SUPER slow.
[6:09:25] <Valdorick> Just build it like a Greatsword in MonHun - FULL RAW
[6:09:27] <Derkinstacker> like move him around and see.
[6:09:28] <%Shadicara> Speed lol
[6:09:29] <%dekkitout> Spood Beest
[6:09:33] <Blank9> blue shield and speedstar is great
[6:09:34] <%supersugoisenpai1> Don't bother with speed boost, try moving him
[6:09:36] <%Shadicara> Needs more DAMAGE
[6:09:40] <%Nope80808> not wotrh
[6:09:42] <Blank9> just yank his ass over to you when you need him to be fast
[6:09:43] <VJdarkworld> 5% :O
[6:09:52] <+BeatBoxersDevMike> the axe "parries" dont count towards the achievement
[6:10:00] <agumon9000> 18% cooldown reduction turns 30 second cool down into 24.6
[6:10:02] <Derkinstacker> Bind sync attack is really strong.
[6:10:02] <%joylent_blue> don't even bother with speed boost if you wanna minmax
[6:10:07] <gryffinp> YEAH
[6:10:07] <%Typhaeon> That damage though
[6:10:12] <al0nem0nster> hits like a truck though.
[6:10:14] <WhereIsWill> but BIG NUMBER tho
[6:10:14] <%joylent_blue> THAT ANIMATION IS THE BEST
[6:10:18] <%Big_Dream> but big damage @AngriestPat
[6:10:19] <%supersugoisenpai1> Royal guard
[6:10:20] <%BestTeaMaker> POWAH GEYSER
[6:10:20] <%Typhaeon> Numbers go UP
[6:10:31] <Derkinstacker> Big damage.
[6:10:36] <%skizzuto> he can MELT boss healthbars
[6:10:36] <jubejube56> Slow but huge damage, melts bosses like butter
[6:10:38] <Blank9> the regular gladius sync combo is biggest number
[6:10:42] <gryffinp> Now do a sim with a BIG guy
[6:10:48] <Derkinstacker> Blue shield
[6:10:53] <Derkinstacker> and just face tank
[6:10:57] <%joylent_blue> he's my fav
[6:10:58] <+BeatBoxersDevMike> it will stop pretty much anything but boss hits
[6:10:59] <VJdarkworld> big boi
[6:11:01] <al0nem0nster> so how's the parry?
[6:11:04] <%goose_attack_almanac> SUMMON SHIELDS
[6:11:04] <%Big_Dream> blue shiled op btw
[6:11:08] <SlimeSlimeSlime> I think Pat just found his guy
[6:11:08] <%filialpails> BAZOOKA TO YOUR FACE
[6:11:09] <+harrisboe> Chat is it possible to give your character facial hair in this game? I haven’t found any facial hair accessories or anything like that
[6:11:09] <%InugamiTheHound> he's a tank class that can do damage
[6:11:10] <+BeatBoxersDevMike> and the special action will protect against anything
[6:11:19] <%Shadicara> BECOME AS VERGIL
[6:11:22] <gryffinp> No, you're too young and japanese for a beard
[6:11:24] <Derkinstacker> Yeah, axe is the best, wait til you fight like a big HP monster, and like 1 shot him.
[6:11:29] <Hunk_Of_Dunk> Is it really an axe if it's more like a greatsword with a small bump?
[6:11:29] <+Risingxiv> @AngriestPat have you ever tried Hit Rush then swapping leigon?
[6:11:30] <+ConLin_Arts_> PogChamp
[6:11:31] <+hazzy_o7> go into l1 stance and dodge
[6:11:32] <+ProtagonistJake> hold l1 and perfect dodge I think thats a thing
[6:11:39] <+BeatBoxersDevMike> its a stronger block
[6:11:50] <%supersugoisenpai1> Just tank it
[6:11:53] <Blank9> speed star is great for him so you can get to sync attacks even faster
[6:11:55] <%BestTeaMaker> that parry
[6:11:58] <%joylent_blue> GOD its so cool
[6:11:59] <jubejube56> You can also dodge in block mode to do a combo
[6:11:59] <%BestTeaMaker> is so beautiful
[6:12:00] <+kraajkase> That parry is the coolest!
[6:12:00] <gryffinp> That perfect call is the best
[6:12:03] <+hazzy_o7> l1 dodge r1 sync
[6:12:05] <+harrisboe> @gryffinp Didn’t stop them from giving Jin facial hair fit for a middle schooler
[6:12:07] <%Shadicara> Yeah pat fuck speed and put more damage on him LUL
[6:12:08] <skinmansgds> The shield also blocks environmental damage, like fire and poison
[6:12:12] <al0nem0nster> someone said dodging in block mode is a combo?
[6:12:13] <+hazzy_o7> r2 I mean
[6:12:23] <Finaldragoon> Blue Shield lets you no sell 3 attacks for free
[6:12:26] <tequilazaku> Royal Guard!
[6:12:27] <waifoong98> FREE HITS
[6:12:32] <gryffinp> @harrisboe Exactly, Jin is so old that he babysat you and that's the best he can manage
[6:12:39] <PrimeNeverproc> summon shields
[6:12:39] <agumon9000> @AngriestPat OH RIGHT. Use his Delay attack. Hit RT, wait a second then RT again
[6:12:43] <Sphincter_Spelunker> @harrisboe The protag is 20. Jin's in his 30's at least
[6:12:47] <%Eaglestrike117> Welcome to Royal Guard, the Legion
[6:12:48] <Derkinstacker> Royal guard, Chain bind, Full combo will melt anything.
[6:12:52] <+harrisboe> @gryffinp Touché
[6:12:54] <%BestTeaMaker> YEP
[6:13:00] <agumon9000> @AngriestPat Use the Delay attack with him
[6:13:08] <waifoong98> basically juggernaut form if it is actually useful lol
[6:13:23] <Derkinstacker> Dodge sync has 2 syns off it.
[6:13:26] <+harrisboe> I just wish I could’ve made a protag that looks like me, facial hair and all
[6:13:45] <%joylent_blue> apatBig hit stop
[6:14:00] <+rorschachsjournal505> Axe boy is best boy
[6:14:01] <%joylent_blue> yyyep
[6:14:01] <Derkinstacker> Hes so boss.
[6:14:02] <%BestTeaMaker> it's so heavy
[6:14:09] <%Keyd00d> Woolie will live it too
[6:14:12] <%Keyd00d> love
[6:14:13] <Sphincter_Spelunker> I see emlo's face coxLuv
[6:14:17] <WhereIsWill> parry animation is the SICKEST
[6:14:17] <%Shadicara> The YEETUS DELETUS stand
[6:14:17] <al0nem0nster> so does dodging during the guard action start a new combo or just the dodge combo?
[6:14:19] <ShichiNoBushi> Patron Howard: "Thanks, Dad!"
[6:14:20] <%joylent_blue> woolie will love live it
[6:14:20] <%BestTeaMaker> why does your dad have the coolest legion
[6:14:24] <Finaldragoon> Axe Legion is literally Royal Guard as a Stand
[6:14:27] <%skizzuto> your dad was a badass
[6:14:36] <jubejube56> His perfect call also looks the best and I believe reflects projectiles
[6:14:38] <%Shadicara> Every hit stuns
[6:14:41] <%Shadicara> That's nasty
[6:14:54] <al0nem0nster> Like I said, you've unlocked "Royal Guardian"
[6:14:58] <%Keyd00d> It does everything!
[6:15:01] <%Pyr0_Fr0st> Best inheiritance ever
[6:15:05] <+harrisboe> Can someone please tell me what the deal is with anime and eyepatches? There are like three characters in this game who have an eyepatch or eye bandage
[6:15:07] <+BeatBoxersDevMike> parry chip also reflects projectiles
[6:15:11] <MoonlightP> oh man i just realized axe probably makes all the dumb portals shooting projectiles way easier
[6:15:17] <waifoong98> @harrisboe it is a fetish
[6:15:19] <Hunk_Of_Dunk> @harrisboe it's raw
[6:15:20] <grimporio> @AngriestPat have you done the charge attack sync?
[6:15:20] <Manjove> Royal Legion
[6:15:24] <%ManicProcrastination> ManicProcrastination subscribed with Twitch Prime. They've subscribed for 8 months! 
[6:15:27] <skinmansgds> Axe's literally only downside is that it moves slower than old people on the sidewalk
[6:15:28] <blackorchidKI2> @harrisboe Because it's cool.
[6:15:33] <blackorchidKI2> apparently.
[6:15:37] <%joylent_blue> i keep forgetting there's even a charge attack holy fuck
[6:15:39] <+Estuko> @harrisboe as I typed your name out to explain, I realized it's just. A thing, fashion and that's all my knowledge has. Huh.
[6:15:44] <skinmansgds> It outclasses every other legion in every way but speed
[6:15:49] <%Shadicara> Yeah so get rid of speed and just throw more damage on him till you get more cooldown Kappa
[6:15:52] <skinmansgds> and range, I suppose
[6:15:53] <Kerozero> Speed buff on him is nutty
[6:15:56] <+trebassstream> Have you used the stinger yet?
[6:16:04] <Blank9> I like mainly swapping between him and blade, sometimes arrow if you need range
[6:16:06] <+harrisboe> @hunk_of_dunk If it was a pirate eyepatch, yeah, but something about anime eyepatches just looks gross to me
[6:16:12] <+trebassstream> Use the charge attack
[6:16:13] <+Estuko> I'm a slut for heavy weapons FLATTENING opponents, it's so good.
[6:16:15] <ShichiNoBushi> Best birthday present ever.
[6:16:15] <%BestTeaMaker> do stinger
[6:16:34] <Blank9> he only autoattacks if you send him with ZL
[6:16:41] <Derkinstacker> Arms for gravity canon, followed by wolf for stun, Axe for chain bind then combo everything in a big circle.
[6:16:43] <+ProtagonistJake> if you check the help menu you can see if he has anything else
[6:16:45] <%skizzuto> I like arrow for range, beast for weak crowds, axe and arm for everything else
[6:16:49] <%Big_Dream> Axe is the best
[6:16:51] <gekizenbu> the strongest form: AXE COP
[6:16:52] <+trebassstream> Charge attack is pretty cool idk if you saw
[6:16:57] <%13ry4n93> it breaks everything
[6:16:59] <%joylent_blue> @AngriestPat don't forget that charge attacks are a thing
[6:17:04] <Zaphire_Saucypants> try crash bomb
[6:17:10] <Blank9> blue shield + speed star is the best
[6:17:10] <%Shadicara> Put 25% damage boost on him too fuck + speed
[6:17:11] <%BestTeaMaker> AXE COP
[6:17:13] <%doc_ock_rokc> AXE COP IS REAL
[6:17:20] <Blank9> you do sync attacks so fast
[6:17:20] <TioXyco> ass cop?
[6:17:26] <%Big_Dream> @AngriestPat now pat make him look evil
[6:17:27] <+trebassstream> You have to use the charge sync attack on an enemy!
[6:17:29] <Sphincter_Spelunker> Ass cop is your sister
[6:17:29] <Valdorick> AXE bodyspray cop?
[6:17:30] <%dekkitout> The only kind of good cop is Axe Cop
[6:17:31] <+harrisboe> God I haven’t thought about Axe Cop in so long
[6:17:31] <madskull456> whens axe cop 2?
[6:17:34] <%13ry4n93> someone made my axe cop jojo crossover fan fiction real!
[6:17:39] <%joylent_blue> thats cool
[6:17:39] <Derkinstacker> Hes the best
[6:17:42] <%Shadicara> R O Y A L G U A R D
[6:17:44] <Sphincter_Spelunker> Royal Guard!
[6:17:47] <Sphincter_Spelunker> Gunslinger!
[6:17:48] <al0nem0nster> you have become tank.
[6:17:50] <waifoong98> Riot Shield LUL
[6:17:50] <Tucker0603> BEST LEGION
[6:17:51] <+kraajkase> How is that an axe though?
[6:17:53] <+harrisboe> Axe Cop was around the same time as Dr McNinja
[6:17:54] <hellfirejefe> under the sword so sick
[6:17:55] <Sphincter_Spelunker> Sword Master!
[6:17:56] <+trebassstream> Charge sync attack on an enemy
[6:18:00] <+harrisboe> Feels so long ago
[6:18:09] <%Divryne> IT'S A SWITCHAXE.
[6:18:10] <%BestTeaMaker> this game is literally SWORDGUNGUARDTRICKGUNGUARDSOWRDGUNTRICKSWORDGUNTRICKPUNCH
[6:18:12] <%Divryne> FROM MON HUN,.
[6:18:13] <Rada150> it's a glaive
[6:18:14] <skinmansgds> It's an axe because it's for chopping
[6:18:15] <Blank9> it's a bardiche
[6:18:17] <haisho> it's an axe with a looooong beard
[6:18:19] <waifoong98> It is just a Sword mode switchaxe
[6:18:20] <Valdorick> How's that an axe? That's axe'ing the real questions.
[6:18:26] <waifoong98> the icon is even similar
[6:18:28] <%Typhaeon> So it's an Axe Cop - Monster Hunter - Jojo crossover
[6:18:29] <%doc_ock_rokc> so axe is royal guard
[6:18:29] <vexion_smh> wacky woohoo anime guy
[6:18:34] <%doc_ock_rokc> Arrow is gunslinger
[6:18:34] <rocketpunchbreaker> try attacking while in guard mode
[6:18:34] <+trebassstream> Yeah trigger it on an enemy
[6:18:36] <al0nem0nster> ...maybe it meant Machete?
[6:18:37] <%Divryne> It's just a MH Switchaxe.
[6:18:43] <%Nope80808> Whats a man to an Axe?
[6:18:44] <Derkinstacker> HE HATES IT
[6:18:44] <%Shadicara> Wacky wahoo STANDO POWAH
[6:18:47] <%joylent_blue> he did attacking while in guard mode
[6:18:48] <+harrisboe> @typhaeon Also Eva. The story is just plagiarism levels of Eva
[6:18:50] <%doc_ock_rokc> What is beast? Trickster?
[6:18:51] <+rorschachsjournal505> I love that his weapon isn’t even an axe, but a weird great sword
[6:18:53] <%Big_Dream> do it
[6:18:54] <Blank9> daddy's boy
[6:18:57] <hellfirejefe> he's also pissed
[6:18:59] <Derkinstacker> Arms has an amazing ability called gravity canon.
[6:18:59] <%Typhaeon> Unlike Gendo I actually like Yoseph
[6:19:00] <Valdorick> What up gamers, its 'ya boi here, Axe Legion, hating being in slavery.
[6:19:04] <%dekkitout> The 'axe head' is shaped like an 'R'
[6:19:04] <Sphincter_Spelunker> Strength build loves the big weapon Legion? Ya don't sy
[6:19:04] <PrimeNeverproc> wee woo wee woo wee woo wee woo
[6:19:06] <+BeatBoxersDevMike> you'll want to unlock the final skill for arms legion
[6:19:07] <%Shadicara> More attack
[6:19:08] <%supersugoisenpai1> It says POLICE, so all the civvies who can't see it know you're a cop
[6:19:08] <Sphincter_Spelunker> say
[6:19:09] <Derkinstacker> Worth investing for
[6:19:09] <%Shadicara> More power
[6:19:23] <%Torruun> pvpMotivated MORE power
[6:19:28] <%Typhaeon> Force feed your axe to harvest its fatty liver
[6:19:35] <%joylent_blue> i miss my peeve sub FeelsBadMan
[6:19:35] <+trebassstream> Charge sync on an enemy has a cool interaction and I just think it's cool
[6:19:40] <+harrisboe> @typhaeon If you haven’t played through the entire game yet, just wait till the end. It just becomes EoE
[6:19:41] <agumon9000> 2 Cool down reductions
[6:19:42] <%Nope80808> DItch speed man its worthless
[6:19:52] <Derkinstacker> Shield all the time
[6:20:00] <waifoong98> So fancy
[6:20:04] <%Shadicara> That shield is bent I can dig it
[6:20:11] <Derkinstacker> Frankly, its better to never unchain him since he should always be attacking with you.
[6:20:13] <%Typhaeon> Well, I don't know how Taura plans to make a trilogy if it's EoE but I'll take your word for it. This is the game that'll sell me on a Switch
[6:20:13] <agumon9000> @AngriestPat The Shield is now faster to cool down recharge than summon swords
[6:20:16] <+BeatBoxersDevMike> cooldown only occurs once broken
[6:20:18] <+Clik404> Axe is my absolute favorite
[6:20:25] <Derkinstacker> Unchain all the others to go in with him.
[6:20:39] <%Nope80808> give every single one HIt Rush
[6:20:42] <Derkinstacker> Speed star means more combos.
[6:20:50] <%Nope80808> You can unchain them all at the same time
[6:20:51] <%skizzuto> It sure is
[6:20:51] <%Keyd00d> 👏
[6:20:52] <%Shadicara> It's ALRIGHT
[6:20:52] <+harrisboe> @typhaeon It leaves room in the end for sequels.
[6:20:53] <haisho> that last one is literally double Bloodspiller. I can see why it's Pat's favorite
[6:20:54] <%joylent_blue> SSSmokin'
[6:20:56] <%BestTeaMaker> look at this character ass action game
[6:20:56] <waifoong98> Pat is orgasming
[6:20:59] <Blank9> more combo, and then you move faster to yank him close to you
[6:20:59] <SlimeSlimeSlime> Bravo~
[6:21:01] <%arancet> next file, ALL CAR PUZZLES
[6:21:03] <al0nem0nster> you can unchain them all at the same time?
[6:21:07] <SlimeSlimeSlime> Another solid stream
[6:21:07] <%spacehouse> Pretty Average
[6:21:09] <+BeatBoxersDevMike> you can use your stand for remote camera mode
[6:21:10] <al0nem0nster> someone said you couldn't.
[6:21:11] <agumon9000> @AngriestPat Since I missed the stream and since its been some time, What did you think of the Kyle fight?
