[0:09:49] <%NovaKnightmare> Lovecraft was the KKK Super Dragon we all fear
[0:09:49] <gustavozxd> holy shit lmao that's really really racist then
[0:09:50] <+thekerobit> he didnt name the cat to be fair, it was his dad

[0:10:00] <+thelastpaleemperor> he recanted his racism in his later life and married a Jewish woman
[0:10:00] <Hydrapissed> he hated himself and everyone else

[0:10:03] <Tennochief> Ultra racist
[0:10:04] <%abakkus> he was so racist that other racists went "woah dude roll it back a lil"
[0:10:05] <Justin_Wood> his racist number was sooooo big
[0:10:06] <eanscrale> Weird his stories became so popular with people who are marginalized.
[0:10:06] <DocMadfox> He actually had an actual fear of black people to the point it was a psychological condition
[0:10:07] <%puhff> He also felt bad about all of that in the last few years before his death

[0:10:07] <Doodle_Taco> @collindoucet99 nwordman, literally

[0:10:41] <%NovaKnightmare> fun fact: his fish people bit was a not so subtle take of race mxiing, so YIKES
[0:10:41] <Ion_Laser> So racist that other racists went "Shit...I need to re-think this."
[0:10:42] <+InuOblivion> 45 is old back then
[0:10:46] <starotter70> 15th century
[0:10:47] <%Kyma1020> When he got out of his house and stop being a hikkikamori
[0:10:47] <Hydrapissed> pat is beyond time
[0:10:49] <%terribleusername> time is a social construct

[0:11:23] <+Michael_Erazo> ocean big too
[0:11:24] <collindoucet99> Also that was a time where a lot of non Anglo Europeans weren’t considered white, so it wasn’t just brown people he hated @angriestpat
[0:11:24] <alexandrecau> Cosmic horror is based on him realizing there is more than white people in the universe

[0:12:32] <personaeffect3> feed him Vodka
[0:12:32] <pectusumbra> @RioGascar he did several things including stuff about dream realms as well as just general degeneracy/corruption type stuff
[0:12:33] <Jetsfantasy> "Pick it up, human bitch"
[0:12:36] <ZazzyDoesStuff> The racism was more a factor of the Fear Of The Unknown. Cause well...do you think a white man in the 30s would actually try to learnabout different cultures?

[0:32:55] <%foreverN2dust> So, you put a flashlight in a paper bag to lure the snipe. It's nocturanl, so you have to do it in the woods in the middle of the night.
[0:32:57] <Tennochief> Snipe's are real
[0:32:58] <%AncelDeLambert> heyya

[0:50:12] <Doodle_Taco> @purps26 Lovecraft is literally the proto-4channer
[0:50:12] <%Deadpal> They speak a random langauge there called welsh!
[0:50:14] <%Rawklobstah88> Are we sure England is real?
[0:50:14] <the_sprankton> I once saw a Venn Diagram about the UK, but it was too confusing to remember what places are part of what.
[0:50:14] <%GarbageQueenEllie> Ahab killed the Welsh a long time ago
[0:50:16] <BunnyEmperor> Wales was created by a Dragon, that's why it's on their flag
[0:50:17] <aero160h> well whales are mammals they might just be beached on England lol
[0:50:17] <$cureneckbeard> They have some lakes in england so I guess that's where the whales live

[1:10:42] <$drfaustisdead> This game is big lovecraft right out of the gate.
[1:10:46] <%vaporousTippler> vaporousTippler subscribed with Twitch Prime. They've subscribed for 11 months! 
[1:10:47] <Delenay> games pretty nig
[1:10:48] <%RioGascar> Why is this feeling more like they made the bord game arkham horror
[1:10:52] <%crimsonharvest> so thats why he hired a boat
[1:10:54] <Zaphire_Saucypants> Advent, full of sub-tier children
[1:10:55] <%RioGascar> And then made a video game version
[1:10:57] <%CappuccinoGuil> @Dementedpenguin okay, but what's the plot so far? Why is he here? Looking for some calamari?
[1:10:57] <ReaversEdge45> Seems a bit far-fetched, but I’ll stick with it
[1:11:02] <%realm_forge> Evil road mc death lane was taken

[1:11:31] <%CappuccinoGuil> @Dementedpenguin YOU KNOW WHAT?! fair enough.
[1:11:31] <Sitromxe> @AngriestPat What do you think the ratio of travelling versus doing actually interesting things will be in this game?
[1:11:33] <+UrielCobalt> What about Diagon Alley?
[1:11:33] <Zaphire_Saucypants> my maddening visions
[1:11:35] <$Timesteel> you can place custom markers for specific quests
[1:11:36] <Dementedpenguin> LUL

[1:17:30] <alexandrecau> @chronoxgp yes guess why she divorced him
[1:17:32] <%terminallyCapriciousz> Tell me more about ARDBERT and the VIERA
[1:17:32] <%AJidai> There is a short story Lovecraft wrote about a family who descended from a bamboo queen, so this is kind of a hint at that
[1:17:33] <mungdip> That's why he didn't like thme
[1:17:34] <%UncleAWOL> ok so most lovecraft games usually start with things being hidden, and having to literally pry the secrets out of people, but it looks like this guy is a few weeks late for that party and we're already 60% of the way into the crazy bullshit
[1:17:38] <DisGuyOvahEre> im glad there's more than just fish people
[1:17:41] <whinniethefeces> @chronoxgp a hypocritical racist. that's new 🤣
[1:17:42] <%GarbageQueenEllie> @chronoxgp Does that mean she was hot, or that he was stupid?
[1:17:43] <DisGuyOvahEre> and lizard people
[1:17:46] <%AJidai> Baboon
[1:17:50] <EySoyCoco> winston?
[1:17:51] <+UrielCobalt> @chronoxgp No, he was quite literally racist and what other bigoted habitats would call him is not really a counter to that.
[1:17:52] <zamzoph> BrokeBack
[1:17:54] <%vaporousTippler> God, I hope this game goes full on batshit.
[1:17:55] <deviljhojho94> Offer him a banana
[1:17:55] <madejustforchat> monkey's voice is great for ASMR
[1:17:56] <+Sh00s> lol

[1:18:39] <+cereal_box_conspiracy> Apocalypse is to post-apocalyptic games what Lovecraftian is to this game.

[1:19:01] <%shiplord13> @AngriestPat Does it not concern you the most human looking character wears a yellow suit and seems to give an air of not being human.
[1:19:02] <BunnyEmperor> Demanding ape
[1:19:03] <juxtest> the guy in this house is just gonna be a big tentacle monster
[1:19:04] <%RioGascar> To me it seems like lovecraft ALREADY happened and the plan succeeded and now we are on the aftermath of that
[1:19:04] <%anticrust> Its Gorilla Grodd!
[1:19:05] <TalisKanju> "It's time for me to get better idle animations"

[1:20:05] <blaggablag> C U R S E D game
[1:20:05] <%MegboyManuel> pretty sure lovecraft was scared of anything not "old-english", so this fits the bill
[1:20:06] <%NovaKnightmare> @chronoxgp thats funny considering the whites at that time were germanic descent
[1:20:06] <+TheSaintJohn> Bevil
[1:20:06] <+Grayhammatter> BIG wet evil
[1:20:07] <%AJidai> If he ends the game set on fire I will be happy

[1:20:48] <+ZenVulgarity> Whoa this game is way larger than I thought it would be
[1:20:48] <+Grayhammatter> shit's underwater
[1:20:49] <tastehbread> the amount of mechanics stuffed into this game is fucking ridiculous
[1:20:49] <Splatterfest> @stinbro Facts Concerning the Late Arthur Jermyn and His Family

[1:21:20] <Reanimator83> Not enough clues to combine anything yet
[1:21:22] <+CronoMagnum> You have to mark everything yourself.
[1:21:22] <chronoxgp> @NovaKnightmare in the 1600's there were yellowmen which were white slaves kind of
[1:21:25] <Peqead> MAYOCIDE NOW
[1:21:25] <alexandrecau> judge their eyes
[1:21:30] <patismyhero> Mind puzzles
[1:21:31] <captainnathaniel> @AngriestPat they don't mark objectives on the map
[1:21:34] <captainnathaniel> you do
[1:21:39] <BunnyEmperor> When's the combat tutorial
[1:21:40] <Zaphire_Saucypants> I'm tempted to play this game now...
[1:21:44] <+KingGilbertIV> I'm actually really happy that they made a cthulu game without setting it in Innsmouth
[1:21:46] <whinniethefeces> oooof that framrate

[1:22:41] <Zaphire_Saucypants> man...his features seem a tad exaggerated.
[1:22:41] <+Jrocy247> What's with his hair??? That's not natural
[1:22:43] <Parapattern> Of all the classic monsters, I think the Cthulu mythos would smell, by far, the worst
[1:22:46] <devanmuse> a (relatively) normal looking black man. that's a good sign
[1:22:51] <fehraf> man looking at all the raw fishes I want some sushi now

[1:26:41] <%CJett92> Pull that devil trigger!
[1:26:42] <+Dives__> When you put a gun to your head
[1:26:42] <+jcenderion> Choo choo
[1:26:43] <%FusRoDom> apatBig apatWrong
[1:26:43] <%Typhaeon> The meter your head is covering

[1:26:44] <rytisone> you just are
[1:26:44] <zamzoph> @AngriestPat You're always crazy
[1:26:44] <thetechnicalraven> Nothing tops the jankiness of The Council.
[1:26:45] <%grinandbearit88> well you start holding your gun to your head
[1:26:45] <+TheSaintJohn> blue bar
[1:26:46] <collindoucet99> This game reminds me of Vampyr for some reason @angriestpat
[1:26:47] <Radski5> You do Persona 3 shit.
[1:26:49] <%shiplord13> You were about to shot yourself in the head
[1:26:49] <captainnathaniel> green meter on the bottom left
[1:26:51] <starotter70> Choo Choo
[1:26:51] <Escherite> Like if Pat tries it a third time is he gonna look in his pants and see a writhing tentacle instead of his dick
[1:26:51] <thetechnicalraven> Top tier jank Kappa
[1:26:52] <EuropantLamprey> Nice, you actively have to stop your own character from committing suicide
[1:26:52] <+bubblebasspickles> ?
[1:26:54] <Rashnam> how does anyone know if they are going crazy?
[1:26:54] <Tennochief> choo choo
[1:26:54] <%nicos143> we've known for awhile
[1:26:54] <Fear_Ranjer> Choo Choo
[1:26:55] <patismyhero> Well you don’t
[1:26:59] <NeroInfinite> You\ll know withth e green meter
[1:27:01] <tastehbread> the man is completely unfazed
[1:27:01] <Sitromxe> @AngriestPat Well, if you start pointing a gun at your temple, that's probably a good sign.
[1:27:02] <$drfaustisdead> @AngriestPat your sanity meter is the blue line next to your health at the bottom left.
[1:27:03] <%supersugoisenpai1> How does anyone know if they're going crazy?

[1:27:10] <madejustforchat> talk to elmo, if he answers, you are done
[1:27:12] <TalisKanju> Eurojank should be a genre
[1:27:24] <EuropantLamprey> Isn't it?
[1:27:24] <+UrielCobalt> @chronoxgp Blanquiemento meant blanquiemento, didn't matter that there were tiers to whiteness. When you say "back then", you mean early 20th century, not exactly prehistoric times. I mean we might as well say that the Nazis aren't "technically" racist too while we are at it, or we can recognize that some so called icons were not exactly good people despite praise they had gotten prior.
[1:27:25] <%GarbageQueenEllie> Do the impossible, touch the unbreakable
[1:27:26] <$Hiro01231> Chat can't help your face is blocking the meter

[1:28:10] <%shiplord13> Okay which old God is he possessed by
[1:28:10] <$PaleBloodInk> Well, a certain level of respect has to be afforded for a game that doesn't fuck around.
[1:28:12] <sonofthedeepsouth> nani
[1:28:14] <NeroInfinite> Yeah this game isn't subtle in the least
[1:28:15] <+StooEsq> dude's just clearing his throat

[1:47:44] <captainnathaniel> @AngriestPat the thing about this game that I saw from everyone that played is that yes, it is interesting, yes it has has great mechanics, the ambience is great. BUT, the bank holds the game back a lot, its hard to actually recommend to someone because of the jank

[1:47:58] <%Swish19XX> @Doodle_Taco Right but a game that punishes you for looking at interesting things might not be a great game mechanic, I get the Lovecraft stuff. Just wondering if there's better ways to go about it

[2:08:04] <+TheLakinessMonster> Apes are friends, not food
[2:08:09] <Sitromxe> Time for a poll chat. Who thinks that any of these choices actually matter?
[2:08:12] <Stay_Hydrated_Bot> @angriestpat stayhyBottle You've been live for over 2 hours. By this point in your broadcast you should have consumed at least 8oz (240mL) of water to maintain optimum hydration.
[2:08:16] <+Grayhammatter> man-eating ells... oh boy
[2:08:18] <hntronium> Fish are food, not friends
[2:08:20] <Parapattern> You're just outside
[2:08:25] <%JJCheeker> I bet he smells like tuna crotch FishMoley
[2:08:26] <alexandrecau> @Parapattern you can't say he was the attacker and then hang his body on hooks after blowing his brain out
[2:08:28] <%doc_ock_rokc> you are just outside!
[2:08:28] <JumbleJams> i guess you cant spawn inside?
[2:08:29] <starotter70> Man gets confused by his own save rotations

[2:08:31] <%doc_ock_rokc> don't worry
[2:08:31] <+RenoDeGeneric> You just load in outside
[2:08:33] <+Noxyba> The saves in this game are weird from what I've seen
[2:08:34] <laserbeaming> Looks like the game is not good at saves

[2:08:36] <+aivalera> Drink aguas
[2:08:36] <%bricupcake> doesn’t matter in the long run
[2:08:38] <Tennochief> I hope they matter so we never see these fish people ever again
[2:08:39] <Us3rr> Pat you're ok
[2:08:43] <ミュウレ4242> there's a lot of choices like this, and they do change how various factions and characters interact later. they all matter.
[2:08:47] <%bricupcake> It really doesn’t matter
[2:09:02] <aimlesshealer> Autosave will betray you
[2:09:06] <Tennochief> not again

[2:09:16] <+aivalera> Game softlocked retry
[2:09:19] <Parapattern> @alexandrecau Well, when your attacker is the son of the most powerful man in the town, you'd probably want to hide the body, too.
[2:09:20] <Tennochief> big big racisms
[2:09:21] <%GarbageQueenEllie> What is Pat gonna do? Get paid or get snitchy?
[2:09:27] <AncientToco> chasefDoggo

[2:10:25] <Us3rr> Ironically if he snitches it will come back to bite him in the ass

[2:23:28] <natebud> Now defeat the dark ones artyom
[2:23:37] <$SGrim> "All debts, public and private." You are obligated to accept this dollar Mr. Monkey. Uncle Sam says so!
[2:23:40] <starotter70> Hopefully someone else son gets killed so we get paid again
[2:23:45] <Djinnazz> It's not snitching if they don't find out.
[2:23:46] <@lewdskeletor13> So wait was that an ape man??

[2:23:59] <alexandrecau> @SubjectX07x not really, why the fuck would you ever trade what can keep you alive two seconds later with someone that might use it to kill you?
[2:24:01] <%FrostMass22> Metro 2033 was weird because I don't understand how the Dark Ones were not bad
[2:24:03] <VirtuaRailith> @collindoucet99 yeah, lovecraft got some racism problems. I like the cosmic horror stuff and feel like you gotta take the good with the bad with him.
