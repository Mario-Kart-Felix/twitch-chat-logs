[0:22:00] <dinnydanny777> So many Koalas have chlamydia that there is concern the entire species may at some point become infertile and go extinct
[0:22:04] <%ChestMimik> The worst part about drop bears is knowing they're not serious but not being 100% sure
[0:22:09] <nomolomo> koalas suck so bad tho

[0:54:25] <Kiaayo> any species would be cool if they're written by yoko taro
[0:54:26] <%Puhff> Puhff subscribed at Tier 1. They've subscribed for 17 months, currently on a 17 month streak! Damn, I am so tired of PUGing in FF14 but all my friends think this is a weeb game. Good news though, took Cassie to my parents farm the other day where she got to see horses and cows for the first time ever! Pet babies and Paige 4 me, thank
[0:54:33] <devanmuse> If Yoko Taro is writing these scenarios, then how many of them do you think are going to die?
[0:54:41] <TotallyAHacker> crystals. thats a bad sign
[0:54:44] <$Sphincter_Spelunker> @Shakosud no, clearing up some update stuff post the first raid from last year
[0:54:46] <%Monkeyweed21> Dwarfs are better than Lalafell cause they know their place as subhuman creatures
[0:54:49] <Drusain> I've been level 35 on free trial since 2017 but I do Gold Saucer weeklys while listening the podcast. My headcanon is that I got PTSD from the BS after Titan and I'm getting over it now
[0:54:53] <%doc_ock_rokc> @ChestMimik The catchphrase of the "dwarfs which are bearded lalafell
[0:54:56] <Deebo305> Better than normal Lalafells anyway, these guys are actually interesting
[0:54:57] <+SirSamVimes> Thankfully all the story content is pretty easy to pug
[0:55:04] <bestwaifuritsu> According to the Taro mobile game SINoALICE, 2b's body vents heat from her core out near her ass. She'd melt your face off before crushing it.
[0:55:04] <Dragon_Batman> Dam
[0:55:08] <%deadbeat34> @devanmuse enough to scar us emotionally.

[1:17:49] <%mikessdd> they're 24 man but you can que up solo
[1:17:49] <krazy_likeafox> @chambatron depends on the raid. they come in 24 man and 8 man generally

[1:18:43] <krazy_likeafox> Welcome to Bullet Hell: The MMO :D
[1:18:54] <%President_Miyazaki> The language of the angels, dope.
[1:18:54] <%Mendin> in the Drakenverse, white is evil. Salt. Flour.

[1:19:09] <skyheys> They're going to blueball us with Drakengard "tee hee"s until the very end
[1:19:18] <Thalchampz> C is for Cursede
[1:19:19] <%ChestMimik> C for Corpse
[1:19:44] <%penitentpentwitch> Yoko designed the AoEs so that you can't 'stay in your lane' blindly or you die. Which kills C.
[1:19:46] <%Mendin> They started the honeydicking with the salt in raid 1 and we KNEW then and there that we wont get resolution till end of 5.5
[1:19:54] <%TubeMan642> TubeMan642 subscribed at Tier 1. They've subscribed for 17 months! Hey pat let Paige now that eat mold is not that weird I actually ate weevils once on accident when they got into all the cereal at my house
[1:19:59] <dinnydanny777> It's like Drakengard, just like the Red Girls in Automata and the Tattoo of the Watchers on Eve's chest, both of which turned out to be almost completely meaningless
[1:20:09] <Caivyre> A for Awful, B for Bad and C for Crap
[1:20:29] <Aydarkzero> how far behind is Pat in gear?

[1:21:35] <%Joustar_> C got hard carried
[1:21:39] <@SSaryn> Chest can be 2nd last and last.

[1:27:40] <@SSaryn> @thefunkiestpunkiest Roe
[1:27:40] <%Pompadourius> Did this fight blind as a healer and god was I grumpy by the end. 'specially as someone who doesn't main healer but was just playing to speed up the queues. lmao
[1:27:42] <+SirSamVimes> rip that poor NIN in C who ate a tankbuster
[1:27:44] <%Joustar_> C NotLikeThis
[1:27:44] <aeonicvector> dont forget, 2p stands for Panasonic, therefore these are ALL pansonic creations
[1:27:55] <%penitentpentwitch> They can at least raise other raids
[1:28:06] <%weissguard> OOF
[1:28:17] <%penitentpentwitch> Uh... If C's tank dies...
[1:28:18] <bestwaifuritsu> LUL C
[1:28:24] <dinnydanny777> It seems like the bosses might have dialogue
[1:28:28] <%President_Miyazaki> 2P, for Paste eaters
[1:28:29] <%tigerfang86> C LUL
[1:28:29] <+Hilleltaco> @Pompadourius I don't think you really need to speed up queues on stuff this new lol
[1:28:31] <%Pompadourius> Had 2 RDMs in my party though so they were putting in work.

[1:28:38] <+Cardz_> ALWAYS C LUL
[1:28:40] <PrimordialDonut> i main red mage for shit like this
[1:28:40] <neVan0> OOF LUL
[1:28:46] <%SleepyMaribo> its a auto wipe if a whole group goes down, because the boss instantly aggros to another group and begins murdering everyone
[1:28:47] <%Joustar_> stop eating crayons C
[1:28:47] <@mothmandraws> maybe C would be better if we didnt tell everyone to take armour off to do crystal tower only
[1:28:49] <+corrosivePaladin> Watching C die repeatedly has been the most interested ive been in FF14
[1:29:00] <%Pompadourius> @Hilleltaco Playing as a tank, and got hit with the "more than 30m" queue, and waited out 10 of those minutes to make sure it was real... :/
[1:29:01] <aeonicvector> agreed moth
[1:29:03] <%Pompadourius> And it was. x.x
[1:29:25] <%Ciglossonjr> That fucking C DRG is really keeping it together
[1:29:25] <%penitentpentwitch> Poor Alliance C(rayon)
[1:29:26] <+Hilleltaco> @Pompadourius Huh, maybe I got lucky with my DPS queue
[1:29:33] <Thalchampz> man that reminds me i was in C on my run just now FeelsBadMan
[1:29:55] <%Pompadourius> @Hilleltaco Nah, it's just the reverse with alliance raids. DPS typically get better queue times than tanks because you only need 3 tanks per 24-man raid.
[1:30:17] <@SSaryn> Yeah B is clearly doing another loot run to get their stuff.
[1:30:17] <%ChestMimik> honestly this makes me wish I didn't hate playing with randos, none of my friends are into MMOs
[1:30:18] <@mothmandraws> diamon frost ptsd
[1:30:19] <+Hilleltaco> @Pompadourius Fair point
[1:30:19] <%Pompadourius> But I had no DPS at the proper ilvl so I used my WHM instead :P
[1:30:19] <%SleepyMaribo> is C always full of bads?

[1:37:56] <+SirSamVimes> like it's pretty well expected for people to eat shit their first time rolling through raids like this
[1:38:00] <bestwaifuritsu> Eden beams
[1:38:15] <%Typhaeon> Who strapped missile launchers and a spider bot to the Enterprise
[1:38:16] <%penitentpentwitch> Good luck
[1:38:26] <%skizzuto> wow I can't believe pat found the right spot
[1:38:30] <%ChestMimik> pray

[1:38:40] <+MadWolf1290> the screens are informative
[1:38:43] <@mothmandraws> pat big brained the hardest mechanic in the raid lol

[1:39:04] <$shadow1man9> Jesus Christ
[1:39:18] <SailingSaturn> and wipe
[1:39:19] <Calek> I just finished this raid and I spent most of the time being dead
[1:39:20] <$Sphincter_Spelunker> when Pat's quiet, you know he's locked in
[1:39:25] <+SirSamVimes> zero rezzers in any alliance
[1:39:25] <+HostilePoundcakes> F
[1:39:26] <@mothmandraws> dragoon rez gooo
[1:39:29] <%Pompadourius> Going tank blind is definitely a good way to go on this raid because you can cover all your inevitable AOE botches with defensive CDs
[1:39:29] <%Joustar_> oh shit
[1:39:30] <%Daniel_Is_I> WIPE CITY
[1:39:32] <%penitentpentwitch> Yeah, we ended up using a healer LB3 on this one
[1:39:32] <%Typhaeon> steakRIP
[1:39:33] <dagreenpillow> DO IT PAT
[1:39:34] <+MadWolf1290> same @Calek
[1:39:34] <+AzureGale> Pat can do it. He can do it nine times
[1:39:37] <%briktal> I don't like mechanics like that because I have a lot of trouble looking around the room and finding those things quickly
[1:39:38] <+RocketBarrel> Go Blackest Night!
[1:39:42] <%Joustar_> YEAAAAAAAHHHH
[1:39:43] <%Pompadourius> Healer LB3 tbh
[1:39:44] <%clockworknate> @SirSamVimes Im a whm healer but hate it when people get upset in chat lol , why i havent done much in heavensward
[1:39:47] <%NopeBadguy> That's a wipe. No one for healing or rezes.
[1:39:48] <%Daniel_Is_I> @mothmandraws Jump the life back into them

[1:41:06] <+Saejinn> SourPls
[1:41:08] <$Sphincter_Spelunker> I can't believe Pat is derailing the raid by interrupting with how fat Zangief is Kappa
[1:41:17] <%kyh9> It means the FPS is about to tank
[1:41:21] <+Hilleltaco> It moves though
[1:41:21] <%Daniel_Is_I> Heya-heya-heyyyyy-eyah
[1:41:24] <Dragon_Batman> It does fit for the bunker design at least
[1:41:27] <%skunkmandoon> He's a loaf of lard.
[1:41:27] <%kyh9> It's the framerate dimension

[1:42:05] <%Pompadourius> Always check your teleporting vending machines
[1:42:27] <+RocketBarrel> I hate how this is my most favorite song is NieR is in this raid. I have a 10% chance of rolling for it xyrafhCry xyrafhCry xyrafhCry
[1:42:34] <+AzureGale> This is the run!
[1:42:39] <%Joustar_> psaCrazyhand psaCrazyhead
[1:42:46] <Deebo305> I feel like this is gonna be the fight that kills Alliances like Thunder God did in Stormblood
[1:43:08] <aeonicvector> @Deebo305 tbqh, every boss
[1:43:13] <%Typhaeon> Small PP tank
[1:43:18] <aeonicvector> this entire raid is monastarey tier more or less
[1:43:44] <%Pompadourius> It's a huge difficulty spike from the first raid imo
[1:43:47] <HCWindo> Pat seen the story yet?
[1:43:55] <+RocketBarrel> This is only the 2nd tier of raids. Cid was 3rd tier. It can only get harder.
[1:44:01] <aeonicvector> its easily the hardest 24man imop
[1:44:02] <%Daniel_Is_I> He hasn't HCWindo
[1:44:09] <huskarl_zap> Joins. "PAT THATS WRONG." Goes back to other stream.
[1:44:10] <HCWindo> Thanks Daniel.
[1:44:11] <@mothmandraws> nah pre nerf orbonne is tougher
[1:44:15] <@mothmandraws> but this is only 2nd tier
[1:44:16] <TioXyco> not 5.3, no. if he did, I do'nt remember him mentioning doing so
[1:44:17] <%Pompadourius> Will Pat be doing MSQ on stream?
[1:44:21] <%Pompadourius> I'd love that.
[1:44:23] <%NopeBadguy> Fastball special your lalafell teammates
[1:44:25] <Dragon_Batman> That would be dope
[1:44:41] <TioXyco> I think he said he'd do expansions, not patches
[1:44:43] <%ChestMimik> Gotta go to Salttown
[1:44:43] <%Monkeyweed21> Firelink Shrine lol
[1:44:46] <@mothmandraws> emils shop at bottom
[1:44:46] <%Typhaeon> I'm sure Caim and Angelus will show up Kappa
[1:44:48] <%RedMageRebel> RedMageRebel subscribed at Tier 1. They've subscribed for 15 months! boy am I excited to finally jump back into this soon, it's been actual years. I'ma going to be so lost
[1:44:48] <+mikesapartment> it's gonna be in the player's living room
[1:44:52] <Dragon_Batman> Man if shadowlords tower would be in
[1:44:57] <+AzureGale> What if the thing waiting at the bottom... is THE REAPER'S GAME
[1:44:59] <%tigerfang86> DA TRUTH
[1:45:03] <TioXyco> he did once, in stormblood, but not again in shadowbringers
[1:45:06] <%Pompadourius> @TioXyco Damn. That's a shame. 5.3 alone is expansion tier imo.
[1:45:09] <%Monkeyweed21> this is the Server room where they store all their backup data
[1:45:12] <aeonicvector> @AzureGale id judgement nut
[1:45:17] <%tigerfang86> @AzureGale finally, kingdom hearts time

[2:04:17] <TioXyco> @DavidCrimsonHeidern he wanteda mechanic of "touch this and die" because "if we die, we die." but the devs said "sorry but no"

[2:06:53] <ShinobiPhoenix> does FFXIV use instanced loot, like do drops only happen for ME alone or are they shared on the screen and rolled for?
[2:06:54] <Darkrenai> What do you mean, YOU PEOPLE
[2:06:55] <%SaiyanShoto> Dad hates us
[2:06:56] <Dragon_Batman> You guys did good

[2:08:14] <ShinobiPhoenix> @Darkrenai so for all my hard work, loot that I want might go to someone else? I hate that

[2:08:34] <+Chewygamer> 2B moon2L
[2:08:34] <+Valison> oh no
[2:08:35] <prime_name> The P series are just fake YoRhas?
[2:08:37] <%Daniel_Is_I> So the machines are just straight-up copying YoRHa
[2:08:37] <%UvBenServed> DOUBT
[2:08:38] <%President_Miyazaki> Give us 2B murdering him here too
[2:08:38] <Dragon_Batman> He's got shorts
[2:08:39] <StarMechV> 2B: GIVE ME MY BOY
[2:08:40] <rufus2k2> Yoko Taro:HAHA
[2:08:41] <Srthunda> objectively
[2:08:42] <%weissguard> About that... LUL
[2:08:43] <bestwaifuritsu> thats a fucking understatement
[2:08:46] <%doc_ock_rokc> EXACT OPPOSITE OF TRUE
[2:08:46] <+NitronStreams> ARA ARA intensifies
[2:08:46] <%tigerfang86> LARGE DOUBT
[2:08:48] <Darkrenai> @ShinobiPhoenix Yeaahhh you kinda just have to hope you roll high
[2:08:48] <%skizzuto> It's Yoko Taro, things can ALWAYS get worse
[2:08:50] <+walternatorz> appreciate the roe kneel
[2:08:51] <Eightesu> P probably means Puppet
[2:08:56] <dinnydanny777> In the Taroverse attempting to make things better will make things worse
[2:08:58] <%Daniel_Is_I> Time for LORE
[2:08:59] <%reonome> i hope she starts choking him LUL
[2:09:00] <PrimordialDonut> don't go to lamia's Limsa. got them shady folk @ciglossonjr
[2:09:03] <%takutoots> psaMenace psaMenace psaMenace
[2:09:04] <cizal11> that means yeah time to walk around
[2:09:08] <%Agami23> that compound 2p kinda looked looked like the flower from drakengard 3
[2:09:11] <%Mindtrick_Matt> Think you'll do the sapphire weapon stuff Pat? Its 1 quest
[2:09:17] <%doc_ock_rokc> @Eightesu its an upside down b
[2:09:17] <cizal11> there's no quest to come back so just do it now
[2:09:18] <jase__x> so 2p is evil...
[2:09:21] <%Mendin> I mean we need the plot hook for Part 3
[2:09:30] <@mothmandraws> its wierd when I did this bit here it has no music, but when I left and came back it did
[2:09:31] <Dragon_Batman> Ah it really is puppet
[2:09:31] <brachydios777> Yeah p probably is for puppet
[2:09:32] <%DavidCrimsonHeidern> "I wish I was little again" -Yoko "Meme Skeleton Man" Taro
[2:09:32] <+Valison> only just noticed the quest is called "Everything you know is wrong"
[2:09:37] <ShinobiPhoenix> damn, I guess I won't be playing after all, I hate that shit. Phantasy Star Onilne 2 is Instanced Loot, you never see what drops for other people and you get what you earned
[2:09:43] <%FacetiousAF> @jase__x no no. "morally grey"
[2:09:47] <StarMechV> go get the lore pat
[2:09:55] <%Pyroclase> oh wow, this is some cool stuff
[2:10:07] <@SSaryn> big lore
[2:10:08] <@mothmandraws> there are 11 pat same as last time
[2:10:08] <%Ciglossonjr> @PrimordialDonut The only person on my friendslist I met in lamia limsa, what kind of shady folk are there?
[2:10:15] <Drusain> but lore is the worst android
[2:10:16] <%Daniel_Is_I> Don't miss any or you'll have to teleport back to the start and run all the way through again
[2:10:18] <Crimpson> I honestly love how they did this. Allowing you to explore the raid to see lore.
[2:10:19] <+corrosivePaladin> So was command in the mountain or did it fall and nuke the mountain?
[2:10:21] <%AzureGale> Cool that you can explore the raid area even after you beat the raid
[2:10:23] <%DavidCrimsonHeidern> L O R E Z
[2:10:25] <@SSaryn> Wait
[2:10:25] <@SSaryn> 11
[2:10:27] <+NitronStreams> inject the lore into my veins
[2:10:31] <@SSaryn> FINAL FANTASY 11?
[2:10:34] <%DavidCrimsonHeidern> 12
[2:10:37] <%ogtrashwizard> There's some really well hidden ones in the command centre, so make sure to watch out for those.
[2:10:42] <%President_Miyazaki> Lore? Data's brother?
[2:10:45] <Dragon_Batman> Pretty standard one
[2:10:45] <@SSaryn> We should play FFXI you say?!
[2:10:49] <%Mendin> We already had a FF11 crossover with the maidens voyage
[2:10:49] <%President_Miyazaki> Wrong androids
[2:10:52] <%gespenst25> no story only lore
[2:10:52] <d00hicky2> More like Final Fatasy
[2:10:55] <%DavidCrimsonHeidern> yeah sure
[2:11:01] <%FacetiousAF> ff11 is canon in nier, you heard that right
[2:11:05] <%Daniel_Is_I> Does FF11 have mahjong?
[2:11:16] <%DavidCrimsonHeidern> No
[2:11:19] <%mikessdd> XI is good but damn is it a fucking hassle to get into
[2:11:20] <%DavidCrimsonHeidern> maybe
[2:11:25] <ItsBigHB> @nellysian kanoTilt go to sleep buddy
[2:11:36] <%SaiyanShoto> uwu
[2:11:37] <2DSuperiority> don't jump off the stairs in the command room or you'll miss lore

[2:12:03] <%DavidCrimsonHeidern> SPIN
[2:12:34] <%DavidCrimsonHeidern> You Repost in the wrong Lorr
[2:12:34] <Crimpson> I wonder if they will do the other characters and Adam and Eve in the final raid of this
[2:12:44] <%Monkeyweed21> talkin bout Eve
[2:12:45] <Eightesu> Adam probably
[2:13:02] <%DavidCrimsonHeidern> psaGiefrail psaGiefrail psaMenace psaMenace
[2:13:10] <2DSuperiority> I feel like if they already used their music they won't show up
[2:13:11] <%mikessdd> be fucking sick if they make it in part 3
[2:13:13] <dinnydanny777> Kind of like human
[2:13:18] <%tattleworm> all the yorha look like that under the skin, it's the same model simone had killed a bunch of
[2:13:35] <Aydarkzero> sliiiiiiiiiiiide
[2:13:38] <%DavidCrimsonHeidern> stardust Robosaders
[2:13:40] <Crimpson> Maybe add the twins

[2:13:54] <Aydarkzero> steal 2b's money
[2:13:54] <+NitronStreams> Toobs room
[2:13:55] <Crimpson> And A2
[2:13:57] <%Pompadourius> I have a slim hope that the final boss will be something related to the OG NieR or Drakengard.
[2:13:59] <%Pompadourius> But probably not.
[2:14:04] <%mikessdd> archived damn
[2:14:04] <%reonome> BibleThump

[2:14:12] <%gupple_> oh hey 21O
[2:14:13] <@SSaryn> @PatStaresAt Before you go into Commanders room, don't jump off, use the stairs. Otherwise you have to go all the way back to the beginning.
[2:14:13] <+notkojima> is chat rules supposed to come up three times? I promise I love elmo, I know he's a good kitty
[2:14:14] <prime_name> That's 2P talking.
[2:14:18] <Bullet_In_Chronostasis> what
[2:14:19] <huskarl_zap> SEXBOTS DONT HAVE SOULS LMAO
[2:14:24] <%DavidCrimsonHeidern> sounds dumb
[2:14:25] <huskarl_zap> SEX BOTS DONT REAL
[2:14:26] <TioXyco> existencial crisis... ah, this sure feels like NieR now
[2:14:27] <Crimpson> Then again.. Final Boss will most likely be Emil
[2:14:30] <%deadbeat34> that's the pure Taro shit
[2:14:41] <%doc_ock_rokc> @notkojima But doo you though?
[2:14:43] <%DavidCrimsonHeidern> psaCrazyhand psaCrazyhead
[2:14:45] <%FacetiousAF> 👀 stairs?
[2:14:47] <Spironito> you should jump off
[2:14:48] <%fishmonger555> All 4 are in this room
[2:14:48] <%Pompadourius> Oh, Emil as a final boss would be fantastic.
[2:14:50] <%fishmonger555> don't freak out
[2:14:54] <%reonome> its always emil
[2:14:55] <%FacetiousAF> monkaS not emil
[2:14:58] <%fishmonger555> thought i missed 3 when i got there
[2:14:59] <Fien111> @Pompadourius Imagine the shit people would flip if Caim and Angelus swoop in
[2:15:07] <%DavidCrimsonHeidern> jump down on the stairs
[2:15:08] <+notkojima> @doc_ock_rokc of course I do! unfortunately I'm a huge racist so it might even out
[2:15:10] <SGrim> GET 2B PREGNANT Kreygasm
[2:15:14] <bestwaifuritsu> fucking mix ANYTHING with emil sacrifice and its gonna be a banger
[2:15:15] <%Mendin> Several emil drones as midbosses and we end with the Queen Zero
[2:15:17] <2DSuperiority> 2 behind
[2:15:19] <@mothmandraws> I wish those would perma collapse, the menu is annoying
[2:15:27] <%Mendin> That or Legion/Red-Eyes
[2:15:28] <%kyh9> Robots are not allowed to have fun, STOP IT
[2:15:28] <rufus2k2> >fishing
[2:15:31] <Dragon_Batman> I wouldn't be surprised if emil was a buddy instead
[2:15:34] <%AzureGale> Stairs!? NOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOO
[2:15:37] <rufus2k2> is he fishing at the right place i wonder :D
[2:15:39] <TioXyco> that chest was there in automata
[2:15:45] <ShinobiPhoenix> isn't Emil Canon dead now?
[2:15:48] <%reonome> S E X
[2:15:49] <%kyh9> Found a porno mag
[2:15:50] <%Pompadourius> @Fien111 I would accept Caim and Angelus, Shadowlord, or Emil as a final boss. All would be excellent choices.
[2:15:52] <FutaSnek> I mean 9S would be a appropriate final boss but
[2:15:56] <%Typhaeon> Mostly a bunch of unnecessary hassle
[2:15:56] <+senfood> They talkin bout fuckin
[2:15:56] <%weissguard> Kappa
[2:15:57] <2DSuperiority> one below
[2:15:57] <%Daniel_Is_I> Now you can jump down
[2:15:57] <StarMechV> The machines are horny
[2:15:58] <cizal11> you can jump down now
[2:16:01] <%Mendin> Most emil are dead yes
[2:16:03] <%Daniel_Is_I> Last one is below
[2:16:03] <%skizzuto> one more when you jump down
[2:16:06] <%Rumbutt> They seem to be in similar locations to what I remember of the chests in Automata Bunker
[2:16:08] <Kiaayo> turn around though
[2:16:09] <+notkojima> appropriate final boss butt indeed
[2:16:11] <cizal11> wait

[2:16:15] <%doc_ock_rokc> Smack the robot with the horny stick
[2:16:17] <Dragon_Batman> I mean 9s was a boss in the last one no?
[2:16:18] <%Pompadourius> I wouldn't really like 9S as a final boss because, well... he already was in the first raid tier. lol
[2:16:19] <@SSaryn> Behind pillar.
[2:16:20] <StarMechV> noooo

[2:16:36] <%reonome> ok thats bullshit
[2:16:39] <%skizzuto> a genius who can read chat
[2:16:45] <cizal11> also def look at the bottom of the left screen before you leave
[2:16:52] <Eightesu> 9S once again best boi for trying to stop 2P
[2:16:54] <Crimpson> Crap. i may have missed that one lol
[2:16:57] <%Daniel_Is_I> You're good

[2:17:05] <@mothmandraws> still 2 androids active
[2:17:08] <%President_Miyazaki> Moon Base Online
[2:17:08] <Eightesu> We were the baddies
[2:17:09] <cizal11> moon base is online. somehow.
[2:17:11] <bestwaifuritsu> MOON BASE : ONLINE
[2:17:11] <Kiaayo> the moon base isn't real though
[2:17:17] <%Pompadourius> MOON BASE ONLINE?
[2:17:17] <FutaSnek> WHO
[2:17:18] <%reonome> HMMMMM
[2:17:18] <%Pompadourius> WHAT
[2:17:22] <FutaSnek> LITERALLY FUCKING WHO
[2:17:22] <Crimpson> 2 are alive
[2:17:26] <xDartuzax> Roboys watching SlatyBet
[2:17:26] <StarMechV> uh oh
[2:17:27] <Aydarkzero> is that for the next part?
[2:17:29] <%mikessdd> those screens are great
[2:17:30] <Spironito> the moon base doesn't exist
[2:17:31] <%doc_ock_rokc> samurai hat and hoodie
[2:17:35] <%reonome> there is a base on the moon, there's just no people there
[2:17:39] <Spironito> @Pompadourius moon base never existed
[2:17:40] <Man_in_the_Red> oh thats gonna be a good fight
[2:17:44] <+mikesapartment> GO BACK
[2:17:45] <@mothmandraws> go back
[2:17:48] <+mikesapartment> it was right there
[2:17:48] <+AmanisHouseOfNonsense> It said Istar on the top
[2:17:50] <FutaSnek> the moon base does (not) exisr=t
[2:17:51] <Dragon_Batman> Which one?
[2:17:54] <%tattleworm> moon base exists, it's just a bunch of stored dna and stuff
[2:17:54] <cizal11> there was one back there lol
[2:17:55] <+notkojima> there's a bass on the moon, but no man to play
[2:17:56] <%Valdorick> Moon base is just dummy servers
[2:18:23] <%reonome> there's pods and androids on the moon base, read the short stories
[2:18:32] <%Pompadourius> It's still unclear if this is the original Bunker or a copy though. And if it's a copy, why would the Moon Base lie still need to exist?
[2:18:32] <Eightesu> the moon server is run by hundreds of pods and one YoRHa android to keep them company
[2:18:38] <Dragon_Batman> I mean the moon base can still be powered, it still has the info for you know
[2:18:53] <%Typhaeon> Enjoy having your mind be a data prisoner for eternity
[2:18:53] <TurtlesAndTentacles> I dont get it
[2:18:54] <prime_name> That's not great
[2:18:56] <TioXyco> feels like NieR, right?
[2:18:58] <%doc_ock_rokc> poor 21o
[2:18:59] <%Daniel_Is_I> I do not understand where this is in the timeline
[2:19:02] <StarMechV> so wait...is this set before or after automata
[2:19:04] <StarMechV> im so confused
[2:19:06] <TurtlesAndTentacles> What does that mean?
[2:19:08] <%Pompadourius> And in FFXIV's world... where would a theoretical Moon Base be?
[2:19:11] <%Mendin> Yes
[2:19:12] <TioXyco> @StarMechV yes
[2:19:13] <Eightesu> in the boss you can hear her cry for 9S
[2:19:13] <%reonome> time is convoluted
[2:19:18] <%doc_ock_rokc> I guess she is Two Ton 21
[2:19:19] <%Monkeyweed21> your existence is used to do AoEs
[2:19:19] <Kiaayo> what would make you think that this is before
[2:19:20] <%Daniel_Is_I> Yeah but if it's set after automata, why don't they know machines can evolve?
[2:19:22] <Fien111> But 2B's here...
[2:19:22] <dinnydanny777> But how is 2B alive
[2:19:27] <dinnydanny777> How is 2B alive
[2:19:29] <+AmanisHouseOfNonsense> ...is there a fucking moon base on Dalamund?
[2:19:29] <TurtlesAndTentacles> chat help a bro out
[2:19:33] <Dragon_Batman> Considering 210's conciousness in the bunker, probably
[2:19:38] <dinnydanny777> How did the Androids survice
[2:19:38] <StarMechV> But 2B acts as if [REDACTED] hasnt happened
[2:19:39] <Man_in_the_Red> @dinnydanny777 Ending E
[2:19:41] <brachydios777> Who’s perspective is that?
[2:19:41] <%doc_ock_rokc> It could be an early cycle
[2:19:44] <%Pompadourius> 2B revives at the end of ending E, guys
[2:19:44] <Maids4lyfe> 2B was rebuilt at the end of the story @dinnydanny777
[2:19:46] <Kiaayo> @Daniel_Is_I this is all gathered information from the past
[2:19:47] <%Pompadourius> Alongside 9S and A2
[2:19:49] <mlpnko0987> hey Pat love you but can't watch cause spoilers <3
[2:19:50] <%skizzuto> Did you guys not see ending E, it explains why 2B would be alive
[2:19:52] <Aydarkzero> wut
[2:19:52] <Them00n> @PatStaresAt Will anything in this story actually matter for Nier 3 though?
[2:19:54] <StarMechV> Why would 2B still work for Command? Command is G O N E
[2:20:02] <cizal11> i can't believe this was put in lmao
[2:20:02] <Eightesu> Maybe the first is really Earth
[2:20:07] <%doc_ock_rokc> If I don't have a heart then what is broken
[2:20:08] <+senfood> ...Imagine.
[2:20:09] <%kyh9> SNIIIIIIIIFF
[2:20:10] <Maids4lyfe> her memory was deleted obviously
[2:20:12] <Man_in_the_Red> the whole thing about Yorha is its like poetry, it rhymes
[2:20:12] <%reonome> LAUNDRY DAY FOR YORHA
[2:20:13] <Fien111> It's been awhile, I kinda forget
[2:20:19] <%Monkeyweed21> SNOOF
[2:20:19] <StarMechV> Oh course this is the last entry lol
[2:20:20] <Maids4lyfe> she forgot about the virus most likely
[2:20:21] <%Typhaeon> Use the hamper you filthy savages
[2:20:21] <jase__x> did yall even play nier autamata, theres an anding where everyone is brought back
[2:20:23] <%hzealot> what even is this they have nier stuff in FF XIV
[2:20:25] <%kyh9> Imagine what it smells like, hahah
[2:20:26] <dinnydanny777> I saw ending E, the idea that 9S perfectly repaired all the Androids at the ending without YORHA is just a bit absurd
[2:20:28] <%Mendin> lol commander always leaves her clothes on the floor
[2:20:29] <prime_name> 2B herself seems to be from before the events of Automata but this Bunker has to be from after the game's events.
[2:20:32] <Crimpson> @Them00n Nah.. This story is completely separate
[2:20:32] <cizal11> for some reason they don't let you go back in there. kinda sucks.
[2:20:35] <%Monkeyweed21> wasn't the commander a HUGE slob
[2:20:36] <%Mendin> 6O commented on it
[2:20:37] <Man_in_the_Red> as in theres a bunch of versions of the bunker we never saw presumably
[2:20:40] <cizal11> wanna take a good look at the alien ship but i guess not.
[2:20:41] <RandomDudeDave> Doesn't the commander leave her clothes lying around?
[2:20:43] <brachydios777> So it’s 2B talking?
[2:20:43] <@mothmandraws> count them if you got 11 you got em all
[2:20:48] <%reonome> yes
[2:20:50] <@SSaryn> Should be all good if you got 11.
[2:20:50] <ShinobiPhoenix> @Monkeyweed21 yes, she was
[2:21:00] <Eightesu> this likely takes place between ending E and the epilogue to "Farewell" only thing i can think of
[2:21:03] <%doc_ock_rokc> My money is this is an early cycle for yorha
[2:21:07] <%Typhaeon> Good jorb.
[2:21:12] <Kiaayo> joke's on you there's actually 12
[2:21:17] <clloudberry> @PatStaresAt Now that you got that out of the way you can get to the real game, Mahjong
[2:21:33] <Kiaayo> mahjong owns though
[2:21:33] <%Pompadourius> @PatStaresAt MSQ?
[2:21:35] <%Pompadourius> Or nah?
[2:21:36] <@SoFarFetched> Wanna talk about Final Fantasy XI then?
[2:21:38] <@Velyndra> DID I HEAR THE WORD MAHJONG
[2:21:39] <Man_in_the_Red> yeah, im thinking this is an OLD bunker since those androids seem new to us
[2:21:43] <@SSaryn> OH
[2:21:43] <dinnydanny777> What happened to the other white clothedAndroids anyway
[2:21:44] <@SSaryn> MAHJONG
[2:21:45] <@mothmandraws> mahjong is required for the 6.0 msq
[2:21:45] <Daxalog> So about Mahjong...
[2:21:48] <%Monkeyweed21> you need to play Mahjong to get Dragon Style @PatStaresAt
[2:21:50] <Fien111> Welp, guess I'm gonna go binge Ratman's Draken/Nier videos again to catch up. Later all
[2:21:50] <%Pompadourius> Oh boy, the car
[2:21:51] <TioXyco> @PatStaresAt accourding to the orchestral show, there was a reading of many novellas that atake palce AFTER the game. in there, two endings were included: one that 9S's data was sent to spacewith the rocket and 2B ceased functions, and one that 9S recevered counciousness and lived on. I might consider This second ending to be the canon and chosen for this path, since it was the ONLY read during the orchestra.
[2:21:51] <%Typhaeon> Skateboard car
[2:21:53] <%Nordguy> mæjång
[2:21:54] <%Pompadourius> Still waiting on that event rerun
[2:21:55] <%AzureGale> Dat car
[2:21:59] <EvanDude47> you can see the bunker now in the overworld
[2:22:00] <%skizzuto> Fuck mahjong
[2:22:00] <@SSaryn> Time to play Mahjong with the bois.
[2:22:03] <cizal11> @dinnydanny777 most of the them died in the raid
[2:22:22] <Eightesu> @dinnydanny777 we were fighting them in the bunker they merged with some of the objects we fight
[2:22:27] <Srthunda> why wouldnt he
[2:22:29] <%Typhaeon> Not ominous at all
[2:22:34] <%mikessdd> yoooo
[2:22:34] <%Monkeyweed21> 9S in the sex dungeon

[2:22:46] <Eightesu> kiss him you fool
[2:22:49] <%reonome> inb4 she chokes him
[2:22:50] <Deebo305> its where they keep all the 2P nudes
[2:22:58] <Kiaayo> "i gotta use him and then kill him, i'm really good at that"
[2:22:59] <Man_in_the_Red> so, if i was to learn mahjong should i learn through FF14, Yakuza, or Clubhouse 51
[2:23:01] <dinnydanny777> @eightesu Oh so that's what that was, they were so small I couldn't see them
[2:23:09] <Dragon_Batman> Oooh did he
[2:23:15] <Dragon_Batman> use his parts?
[2:23:17] <%Typhaeon> See you in Part 3 nerds
[2:23:18] <TioXyco> @Man_in_the_Red yes
[2:23:22] <Kiaayo> @Man_in_the_Red clubhouse 51, although there's a webgame called mahjong soul that's best
[2:23:24] <%mikessdd> it's like. why do you keep this unconsious young boy in a cave?
[2:23:24] <ShinobiPhoenix> last time we did that, she turned white and turned to kill us

[2:31:30] <%reonome> MAGIC
[2:31:32] <R0DA> science magic
[2:31:35] <tranman090> Nier is just KH2
[2:31:36] <%Mendin> @dinnydanny777 Drakenier Magitek
[2:31:36] <ShinobiPhoenix> I hope we can get A2 back
[2:31:38] <TurtlesAndTentacles> LIES PAT
[2:31:41] <%Daniel_Is_I> @dinnydanny777 The white light is basically magitech
[2:31:41] <TioXyco> actually magic
[2:31:42] <Dragon_Batman> It's apart of their close combat magic science
[2:31:42] <%Pompadourius> God I love her <3
[2:31:44] <%luftraumm1> how hard is it gonna be to get those weapons?
[2:31:44] <%doc_ock_rokc> ADVANCED TECNOLOGY
[2:31:46] <%takutoots> its digitized isnt it?
[2:31:48] <brachydios777> They are technically usbs aren’t they?
[2:31:49] <BlueLunecy> It's important that magic is actually real in Nier Automata
[2:31:52] <ShinobiPhoenix> or even P and Devola
[2:31:52] <%AzureGale> Wat
[2:31:53] <%Monkeyweed21> god toobs why you gotta be so tsun
[2:31:58] <@SoFarFetched> Tell her to pee in a cup
[2:32:04] <FutaSnek> Wow chat the power went off in my entire neighborhood and the chads had it fixed in less then an hour, not all heros wear capes. in fact the majority dont
[2:32:13] <Zourath> It's all Kingdom Hearts? Always has been.
[2:32:15] <%SaiyanShoto> pee on the couch
[2:32:17] <%weissguard> wut @SoFarFetched
[2:32:23] <%Mendin> Automata-era technomagic is slightly different from Draken-Nier1 magic aka Old World Magic
[2:32:23] <+conqueror1> msq is so good
[2:32:24] <%BubbaRands> psaGief please mother dont leave
[2:32:27] <%Mendin> But mostly the same
[2:32:28] <ha2ken> He is potat

[2:32:43] <%Pompadourius> Dark Knight katana and SAM katana pls
[2:32:43] <Eightesu> she's taking our boi
[2:32:44] <%skizzuto> It all adds up, the Ascians are just Organization 13, after all
[2:32:48] <%luftraumm1> psaGief_SG
[2:32:51] <Eightesu> she gone
[2:32:56] <Man_in_the_Red> @mendin still uses ground up Angelus
[2:32:56] <R0DA> I'm legit hyped for the next one, this new one is rad as HECK
[2:32:56] <2DSuperiority> That BLM Emil rod a fan drew up has me up at night
[2:32:56] <qu3kl41n_the_impure_king> Yo Pat! just got done with the story, didnt cry! it wasnt easy though :P
[2:32:56] <%reonome> bye toobs
[2:32:59] <%President_Miyazaki> There's a 3rd Nier raid?
[2:32:59] <Man_in_the_Red> i think
[2:33:03] <Drusain> kingdom hearts you say bizNani bizNani
[2:33:03] <%Monkeyweed21> Kangdom Horfs
[2:33:05] <%doc_ock_rokc> If 2b's sword does telportation and floating that would be cool
[2:33:06] <dagreenpillow> I want A2, that's all
[2:33:22] <Eightesu> A2 probably won't show
[2:33:23] <Thalchampz> there will be a third one by patch 5.5
[2:33:25] <%Mendin> @Man_in_the_Red No they cleaned that up pre-Nier and teleported Tokyo back in time to pre-Drakengard 3 because TIMELINES
[2:33:27] <%mikessdd> damn this post raid is taking a bit
[2:33:28] <brachydios777> It’s not every day a crossover is also a plot continuation
[2:33:30] <%luftraumm1> isn't there already a DRK nodachi?
[2:33:31] <StarMechV> wait thats a girl?
[2:33:31] <%doc_ock_rokc> Dang this is sad we need an Emil shop song
[2:33:32] <Eightesu> Yoko says her fate is to be ambiguous
[2:33:37] <Dragon_Batman> I hope for A2 to be involved as well, but yea she probably won't make it in
[2:33:38] <Deebo305> No 24 man has ever given weapons doubt they'd start with this
[2:33:39] <%reonome> she's fucking dead
[2:33:42] <%Monkeyweed21> Remember: the next Kingdom Hearts is Versus XIII @PatStaresAt
[2:33:52] <%Daniel_Is_I> DRGs would probably get the Phoenix Spear
[2:33:54] <R0DA> imagine emil setting up in an instanced shop area that plays his song
[2:34:07] <%Pompadourius> They could even just give them as glam quest rewards. Level 1 weapons.
[2:34:08] <%Mendin> imagine Accord
[2:34:09] <%Pompadourius> Like c'mon.
[2:34:14] <Eightesu> A2 after ending E is left vague
[2:34:15] <Kiaayo> that cow is far away
[2:34:15] <%mikessdd> I left my game at I have to do the trial. and I still have to run this raid for the first time. waiting for a friend to catch up. He didn't know patch was today
[2:34:16] <%reonome> shhhh
[2:34:17] <%doc_ock_rokc> @R0DA yes
[2:34:22] <%Monkeyweed21> Time is convoluted in Drangleic
[2:34:24] <%Daniel_Is_I> @Mendin You find a flyer for Accord's shop in the first raid
[2:34:24] <%tattleworm> give beastlord and iron will
[2:34:32] <primarch_lupercal> just imagining 2B princess carrying 9S out of there
[2:34:34] <dinnydanny777> It looks like it's in the wrong perspective
[2:34:40] <%Mendin> Right, I forgot about that.
[2:34:47] <2DSuperiority> I hope Komra just plays that song forever
[2:34:48] <R0DA> Like a sack of popotoes
[2:35:24] <brachydios777> So the space starion just ended up in Eroza? Or is it in Neir’s world?
[2:35:30] <%lemon_rinds> lemon_rinds subscribed at Tier 1. They've subscribed for 6 months, currently on a 5 month streak! Hell yeah brother Kappa
[2:35:44] <%BubbaRands> nope just a potatoe
[2:35:47] <Eightesu> the bunker is probably a copy of the real one
[2:35:53] <dinnydanny777> Is Final Fantasy converging with Nier?
[2:36:02] <Eightesu> it's called the "Puppets bunker" after all
[2:36:12] <2DSuperiority> murder-crazed dwarf gone missing
[2:36:16] <Zourath> Like some sort of... duplicate stronghold.
[2:36:21] <Man_in_the_Red> this is an old bunker that made it to Eorzia... or is this not in the source
[2:36:34] <%luftraumm1> God imagine if ffxvi was directed by taro
[2:36:35] <R0DA> one built by the machines as they traveled through space
[2:36:38] <brachydios777> It’s a copy right, but it just ended up in FF14’s world?
[2:36:38] <TioXyco> @Eightesu i'd say the name is tied to automata's lore, as in the androids being puppets
[2:36:39] <%Pompadourius> @Man_in_the_Red This is Norvrandt
[2:36:46] <Man_in_the_Red> ah
[2:36:51] <Eightesu> All the androids in the bunker are their designation followed by the P, P probably meaning Puppet
[2:36:54] <%mikessdd> yeah this is technically the first not the source
[2:37:01] <Thalchampz> END OF THAT
[2:37:04] <+corrosivePaladin> just use your bone. its durable right?
[2:37:09] <%Monkeyweed21> 2Poop
[2:37:14] <Dragon_Batman> You just got that?
[2:37:15] <Crimpson> @luftraumm1 We would get butt sliders on day 1
[2:37:17] <%reonome> 2Pee
[2:37:20] <%deadbeat34> oh....this IS some taro shit.
[2:37:22] <%kujofire990> that's the end of that chapter
[2:37:22] <%Daniel_Is_I> AND THAT'S THE END. Hooray for depression!
[2:37:28] <%Rumbutt> I stand by 2Pits
[2:37:29] <Dragon_Batman> Your doing your best
[2:37:31] <$shadow1man9> @PatStaresAt Sorrow of Werlyt time?
[2:37:33] <Eightesu> i just told you that Pat!
[2:37:34] <%Pompadourius> @PatStaresAt MSQ stream?
[2:37:36] <%luftraumm1> any ideas of where next expac is going?
[2:37:37] <%Daniel_Is_I> NOW START THE MSQ
[2:37:38] <StarMechV> and thats the end, enjoy ebing alone you fucker
[2:37:39] <%reonome> i guess anogg is fucking dead
[2:37:41] <%mikessdd> I mean you crushed the raid so yeah
[2:37:42] <dinnydanny777> That was it?
[2:37:43] <R0DA> The concept of "ffxiv's world" is hella complicated, we've got fractured shards of the original world, we've got timetravel multiverses, and we've got space alien dragons
[2:37:43] <2DSuperiority> what a high note to end on. thanks Taro
[2:37:45] <%AzureGale> Thank YOU, Pat
[2:37:47] <%weissguard> Thanks for the stream dude.
[2:37:47] <Crimpson> Yeah. The ending was a bit odd
[2:37:47] <%Pompadourius> MSQ BEST PART
[2:37:48] <Man_in_the_Red> Encore on stream?
[2:37:48] <Caivyre> do the cool mech thing, coward
[2:37:48] <%maenos2> yeah that was shorter than i expected
[2:37:48] <xxshadowxx416> what if the end of final fantsy 7 remake is a raid in ff14
[2:37:49] <Eightesu> I TOLD YOU EVERYTHING
[2:37:52] <%kid_flashionable> psaGiefrail
[2:37:55] <$spardanwarrior> Now to wait for 10 more months for part 3
[2:37:55] <%Daniel_Is_I> Oh actually Sorrow of Werlyt would be good for this
[2:37:55] <%Monkeyweed21> back to eating ass for money and fun?
[2:37:55] <%Pyroclase> I really should get into FFXIV isntead of WoW, hmm.
[2:37:59] <rookieknookie> How'd you get so much gil?
[2:37:59] <brachydios777> And I’m guessing the machines copied the space station along with the copy androids
[2:38:01] <PrimordialDonut> Will you stream msq or do it on your own time?
[2:38:01] <%Typhaeon> Goodnight
[2:38:02] <%AzureGale> I can't believe Anog is fucking dead
[2:38:03] <%TheMattman1313> Anogg was a Machine Lifeform anyway
[2:38:05] <VirtuaRailith> psaGiefrail
[2:38:10] <Dragon_Batman> @brachydios777 the bunker looks like it crashed into the mountain but I'm not shure
[2:38:13] <%AlphaTauri> I just got here ;_;
[2:38:14] <%doc_ock_rokc> Oh pat if you want a thing while your ac is down just yell i can wip something up fast
[2:38:21] <%Pompadourius> See you all in 5.5 after 90% of the population has died IRL.
[2:38:23] <Dragon_Batman> Motiff?
[2:38:25] <+marlborored5> lol
[2:38:30] <%reonome> HMMMMMM
[2:38:37] <Dragon_Batman> That would be kinda fun
[2:38:39] <Eightesu> you think this raid will be considered canon to the "Yokoverse"
[2:38:41] <%Fatmanjoggin> Nah, they turn into books
[2:38:42] <Caivyre> what if we're all robots
[2:38:43] <R0DA> Anogg is A Frogg
[2:38:47] <%doc_ock_rokc> THEY ARE MACHINE LIFEFORMS
[2:38:48] <%Monkeyweed21> Hey Pat, do you still think that your blanket is green when its clearly blue @PatStaresAt
[2:38:53] <%Pompadourius> Can't remember, was Anogg the one who trusted or didn't trust 2P?
[2:39:00] <brachydios777> Maybe the machines are trying to make more Adam and Eve like machines?
[2:39:04] <2DSuperiority> they are Emil and his sister CALLING IT
[2:39:06] <tanithmagnus> so, which twins gonna get murdered?
[2:39:06] <%deadbeat34> calling it now, because they inhaled the dust in the first raid, they're coming back with red eyes in the third raid
[2:39:14] <Eightesu> Konogg didn't trust 2P @Pompadourius
[2:39:22] <qu3kl41n_the_impure_king> ooooh pat is queing on tank? get comfortable
[2:39:26] <VirtuaRailith> Paige will eat more mold if she doesn't get attention
[2:39:37] <%Pompadourius> @Eightesu Which means Anogg, the one in white, DID trust 2P? Oh shit. LUL
[2:39:40] <+dante_must_die_exe> HA HA HA LUL
[2:39:43] <Dragon_Batman> They did do a join together thing similar to how Adam came to be
[2:39:48] <+dante_must_die_exe> potato poison
[2:39:50] <%miguelrod777> LUL
[2:39:51] <%Rumbutt> She ate mold for CLOUT
[2:39:56] <Caivyre> eat the mold to grow stronger
[2:40:08] <+NitronStreams> Eat mold for clout
[2:40:08] <Caivyre> absorb the mold, become the mold
[2:40:10] <%Monkeyweed21> or do eat it
[2:40:10] <%Puhff> he choke on own ass
[2:40:13] <Eightesu> @Pompadourius yep which is why she feels really guilty for fully trusting her to help defend the vllage
[2:40:20] <%takutoots> mold = bold
[2:40:20] <%AzureGale> Ewwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwww
[2:40:40] <%doc_ock_rokc> Oh pat I sent paige a revision on the thing should I send it to you? or could she access it later
[2:40:41] <%clockworknate> mold actually cures hairloss
[2:40:44] <%Monkeyweed21> also know as rice weevil or jumping beans
[2:40:48] <@SoFarFetched> BigNaturalman wants you to play FFXI
[2:40:51] <%mikessdd> paige ate mold because she thought it would make her cultured
[2:40:58] <%Puhff> Hope Paige doesn't turn into one of those Mold monsters from Control
[2:41:17] <%Monkeyweed21> UwU Cat Boys FOR LIFE
[2:41:18] <%cvp5127> nerd
[2:41:28] <hewhowaits> cheer500 hey pat would you ever revisit darkwood
[2:41:32] <%Fatmanjoggin> Roes rad
[2:41:33] <Eightesu> i was hoping for 9S glam at the end of this raid
[2:41:35] <Dragon_Batman> It would be kool if the flight unit was a mount
[2:41:40] <%Monkeyweed21> i will never stop being a twinky bishie cat boi
[2:41:40] <brachydios777> Machines trying to make their own androids again seem like their still trying to understand humanity or something
[2:41:59] <Dragon_Batman> Thanks for streamin Pat
[2:42:04] <%Pompadourius> C'ya o/
[2:42:06] <%clockworknate> I thought the raid would have a nier mount
[2:42:07] <%Monkeyweed21> Do extreme @PatStaresAt
[2:42:09] <%FacetiousAF> 🤔 what software does humble not fucin sell? crypto mining?

[2:42:20] <%kid_flashionable> psaSmug
[2:42:22] <%FacetiousAF> especially YOU
[2:42:25] <Eightesu> they likely repeated making something similar to Adam but instead of wanting to understand humanity she had the desire to replicate herself
[2:42:26] <Dragon_Batman> Night everybody
