[0:07:42] <ergulor> instead of an intro
[0:07:43] <+GiefHoward> first business on the moon will be GME, then AMC, parking lot full of TSLA

[0:10:26] <%Evil_Emu147> To sum it up in a nutshell: A company that was basically bankrupt a few months ago is now with billions more than it was by virtue of the fact that some hedge funds decided to bet everything on the No Pass line at the craps table

[0:11:08] <%KishinGrek> I'm hoping it'll come to PS5 in a year
[0:11:10] <+DarkDragoonZero> @PatStaresAt How is your head feeling?
[0:11:11] <enkaisu> i feel like if you streamed The Medium your PC would explode, that game seems super demanding
[0:11:12] <@commanderclaw> Apparently it's only 8 hours long
[0:11:14] <%PanicSwytch> Must review garbage
[0:11:19] <penitentpendant> It might go the way of Amnesia Rebirth. One and done. Good soundtrack at least.
[0:11:20] <+c9s_bong_salesman> @PatStaresAt everyone is talking about economy fundamentals, I wish they would fund-a-mental healthcare program in my area :(

[0:12:12] <%asgard147> Yay! Pat's okay! limesYay
[0:12:13] <JoshManVGH> Was it the hair all along that was causing it?
[0:12:16] <%TheMattman1313> With the ice cold, refreshing taste of Monster Energy Zero
[0:12:16] <%ElkRiverDog> coxHypers coxHypers coxHypers
[0:12:17] <blackbaron98> Coke?
[0:12:19] <+UrielCobalt> Yeah, toxins, not actual vitamins
[0:12:19] <%linSP> maybe pat had headaches because of the alieeeens hair
[0:12:22] <%captain_thickthighs> pets migraines clear as soon as the stock market is failing coincidence I think not
[0:12:25] <%Agami23> the biggest thing i can suggest is muscle relaxers
[0:12:27] <penitentpendant> The fact that The Medium is already on (admittedly 10%) discount on steam for PREORDER is telling.
[0:12:27] <SilverFaustX> monkaS
[0:12:27] <ToneBacas> reasonable
[0:12:28] <%Agami23> brain is a big muscle
[0:12:28] <%KishinGrek> do coke
[0:12:32] <Admiral_PopnFresh> EGG!
[0:12:32] <+DarkDragoonZero> @PatStaresAt yeah ive had some migraines in the past but all that helped was sleep
[0:12:32] <%asgard147> limesFeels
[0:12:36] <%coreyyotto> Do you have telehealth services that can do that?
[0:12:39] <+Mottyrob> Smooth egg-shaped Pat head accompanied by slightly egg-shaped Pat torso. Looking great!
[0:12:39] <JoshManVGH> You guys don't have telemedicine in Canada?
[0:12:41] <SilverFaustX> get a house call?
[0:12:41] <Gieron667> Your stream's thumbnail is "Give me your money" @PatStaresAt LOL
[0:12:46] <TOONFOOD> It was the hair putting pressure on the head
[0:12:48] <%drabberfaun535> cant you call in?
[0:12:48] <hot4dukat> yay eggPat
[0:12:54] <+OhioNitsud> Careful with those narcs
[0:12:55] <blackbaron98> just inject some wed
[0:12:56] <+PrincessLuna85> @PatStaresAt i work at a hospital its not that bad they keep covid patients in a separate area
[0:12:56] <DaKnightWarrior> made it.
[0:13:03] <+omegafree13> did they lift stay at home orders where you live?
[0:13:06] <%SomeSageAdvice> i hated just even going near the covid testing facility when we had a covid scare at work, but i had to go
[0:13:06] <%Taisuru> Drink Weed
[0:13:08] <+c9s_bong_salesman> @PatStaresAt why egg now?
[0:13:09] <Tokudon> just scoop your eyes out with spoons its the same thing
[0:13:10] <%Rafferty3231> places around here have you wait in your car and they call you when it's clear
[0:13:10] <%captain_thickthighs> Does the weed help?
[0:13:12] <%coreyyotto> here in florida they do
[0:13:14] <%anticrust> Thats cause your Doctor is a bitch
[0:13:14] <%shruke> The way doctors up here are doing it is wait in car until appointment, and one at a time. But prolly not everywhere
[0:13:14] <BigHooppaw> I work for a hospital and, as safe as we try and make it, I get it
[0:13:15] <+CezrDaPleazr> Your egg doctor?
[0:13:15] <+SnakesFunBox> Pat you should get your weed drops. THC and CBD has helped me weirdly enough
[0:13:17] <%asgard147> yeah it's not great
[0:13:19] <%baka_sugoi> no deals over the phone
[0:13:23] <Winner_92> hello egg :D
[0:13:23] <brunoberserk> JUST DO DRUGS
[0:13:23] <%DappercatEsquire> if it's like the US, certain types of prescriptions can't be called in

[0:13:30] <%Engwithan_Elder_God> My doctor office had you wait in your car until they call you in.
[0:13:32] <%TheMattman1313> You should Astral Project with Paige sometimes
[0:13:35] <%asgard147> try it next time?
[0:13:36] <+infinite_rotation> Everybody want pain drugs
[0:13:36] <%crimsonharvest> If you find that CBD helps, you can buy hemp flower in bulk for $60/500g
[0:13:37] <%Agami23> try the weed, if that doesent work ask about muscle relaxers or something
[0:13:39] <SummonerMagno> based weed
[0:13:44] <penitentpendant> That's better... ish
[0:13:46] <marvel877> Pat has on recording said the words "YO I GOT A 40 OF CRACK!" once.
[0:13:50] <%asgard147> limesThink
[0:13:50] <Diablo169> Are you feeling better Pat?
[0:13:55] <%Agami23> thats what my mom does for her migraines
[0:13:57] <+infinite_rotation> Is this that new game by the shovel knight devs?
[0:13:58] <enkaisu> Cyber Shadow is a ball buster of a game
[0:14:01] <%Agami23> the brain is a big muscle
[0:14:11] <brunoberserk> i played the first 2 levels , is a really good game
[0:14:14] <hot4dukat> benydryl put u right out
[0:14:18] <marvel877> @infinite_rotation published by yacht club, yeah.
[0:14:19] <chimeraxmachina> Funnily enough weed was what cured my migraines permanently. Used to get them at least once a month, aura and all
[0:14:21] <DrFacilier> try a codeine cocktail :D
[0:14:21] <%GiantRatThatMakesTheRulz> just drink enough booze so that you can't feel anything
[0:14:21] <+cvp5127> pat whats happening to gamestop?
[0:14:23] <%Evil_Emu147> Pat, I'm a risk averse financial baby but also want to get rich quick on this crazy meme train! Does Elmo have any sage advice?
[0:14:23] <bleugh> bald
[0:14:36] <%Agami23> i typically just go unconcious when i get a migraine so i dunno.
[0:14:41] <DrFacilier> stonks are happen
[0:14:43] <iosephe> stonks
[0:14:43] <%anticrust> STONKS
[0:14:48] <Tokudon> gamestop is being shitty like always
[0:14:49] <hot4dukat> lmao
[0:14:51] <+gimmickypizza> Stonks
[0:14:52] <blackbaron98> Thats a job lol
[0:14:52] <Dreigun> I get those headaches regularly. Neck muscles suck ><
[0:14:55] <hot4dukat> its troo
[0:14:56] <%DEETRz> i bought 1 stonk to be part of the rocket ship to the moon
[0:14:56] <@commanderclaw> Neither does wall street
[0:14:56] <silverira> I like the stonks
[0:14:57] <fragdar> hey man, nothing wrong with beggin
[0:14:58] <insomniac_doze_> I have migraines because of pain in my neck
[0:14:58] <%Ancopro> increases value of Pat
[0:15:00] <+GiefHoward> buy high, sell higher
[0:15:02] <%crimsonharvest> if you do test weed out try a product with non-accidental CBD content for maximum relief
[0:15:03] <marvel877> show feet. rub orb. where's elmo?
[0:15:03] <+Arnoldoaad1> Strong Stonks
[0:15:04] <JoshManVGH> It may depend on your history. Where you have a family history of migraines established, I would hope a remote session would be viable. Likely still have to physically pick up the written prescription though.
[0:15:07] <%TheMattman1313> Some rich kids are fucking over other rich kids by gambling with businesses and people's jobs out of spite.
[0:15:10] <Storm_Samurai> Isn’t that what everyone does

[0:27:03] <Broken_Sonex> Also the art style isn’t hideous
[0:27:09] <%SaiyanShoto> I care about one piece :(
[0:27:18] <%Agami23> lost in vivo is just a silent hill game as well
[0:27:19] <penitentpendant> It should get at least one video

[0:27:37] <%X2Eliah> Will this be a Silent Hill game with much noise in a flat plain?
[0:27:38] <Harthrul> double helix
[0:27:41] <%DappercatEsquire> does Visage count as Silent Hill inspired?
[0:27:41] <Harthrul> wasn't it?

[0:27:57] <%Monkeyweed21> @fuji_92 the author said that idea is dumb and that the one piece is a real object

[0:28:51] <lionsignal> how do i stop playing ff 14
[0:28:58] <%BoxNavy> simply do not do them
[0:29:04] <%BoxNavy> unless theyre blue
[0:29:05] <%anticrust> but they are funner
[0:29:15] <penitentpendant> You SHOULD probably do the "Blue Plus" sidequests though for more content
[0:29:22] <%Taisuru> I've nearly done every single sidequest in the game at this point
[0:29:28] <SummonerMagno> im just leaving them for the next expansion
[0:29:31] <DianaTheAscian> @PatStaresAt what if most of them suck ass?
[0:29:32] <KaiserMario> Matt throwing that axe down a chasm is forever in the annals of history
[0:29:51] <%Garthunox> There's a really nice Haucerfaunt esque character in one of them
[0:30:00] <scrumbotime> The side quests are usually good in quality, but shit ass in rewards unless its specifically an unlock one
[0:30:06] <%Taisuru> @DianaTheAscian Once you get to HW they're all pretty decent
[0:30:20] <+D00msDayDan> PW's presentation isn't as polished as ace combat 7 but it plays even better
[0:30:40] <%Starotter70> HEY
[0:30:42] <%Promessa_EX> I just like fly plane
[0:30:47] <%SirGO0SE> yoshi a bynch
[0:30:52] <%Promessa_EX> Missile go woosh
[0:30:55] <%Monkeyweed21> yoshi the unbirthing monster
[0:30:56] <%Taisuru> @DianaTheAscian Alternatively, do any sidequests with an image on the quest preview thing, those are all more significant
[0:30:56] <monsieurfantastic> who's worse, yoshi or banjo?
[0:30:57] <%Promessa_EX> Gun go brrrrr
[0:31:02] <servicesuspension> Old Yoshi is cool, new deformed tumor looking Yoshi is a blight
[0:31:02] <brandt_connors> dual claws
[0:31:03] <%mikessdd> The side quests are good for saving Gil if you haven’t bought all the equipment yet I suppose. So good for brand new players.
[0:31:08] <+Dova573> But shield is fun

[0:31:16] <%TheGreatSkenardo> I started playing Dangnabrumpus, and it's impressive how someone ran over phoenix wright with persona 3, and then scraped the paste over clunky gameplay mechanics.

[0:37:45] <%YakumoYomi> I still love the beep-boops of NES game music
[0:37:49] <%Alazull> Legion
[0:37:49] <marvel877> CRT filter in this is not that great. Its an afterthought that messes up the games color palette and sprites that were CLEARLY made without CRT in mind.
[0:37:49] <%X2Eliah> legion
[0:37:50] <penitentpendant> Hail Legion!
[0:37:52] <rufus2k2> we are legion

[0:40:18] <penitentpendant> I've seen videos, no thanks
[0:40:18] <%Alazull> It was some big big bullshit
[0:40:18] <%Engwithan_Elder_God> Nintendo was 100% bullshit in all games.
[0:40:18] <DianaTheAscian> I am children and I know
[0:40:20] <$Afterman_> how does the gameplay feel pat
[0:40:20] <rufus2k2> I seen the summoning salt speedrun video at least
[0:40:23] <TehMud> NES Ninja Gaiden had all of the bullshit
[0:40:24] <%McSoliace> "Was"
[0:40:24] <Hyde_01> it was LUL
[0:40:25] <+OmegaWeltall> that was some BULLSHIT LUL
[0:40:26] <servicesuspension> I know thanks to emulators, what a fucking nightmare
[0:40:26] <marvel877> Dude, I played Ninja Gaiden last month.
[0:40:29] <%Promessa_EX> It looks like it feels nice
[0:40:29] <+takutoots> LUL
[0:40:30] <%Mendin> The dujration of that sword hitbox, mmm, delicious
[0:40:32] <@commanderclaw> That last level was bullshit
[0:40:33] <+BallerSwagBro9k> i member
[0:40:33] <ExpressNode> Yeah the respawning enemies when you step slightly of screen was bullshit
[0:40:33] <archangelx27x> We have nintendo switches tho
[0:40:34] <dukenux> Did Ninja Gaiden start as a 2d platformer, like Metal Gear?
[0:40:34] <+Shady_Zaku> Is Cyber Shadow the new Messenger?
[0:40:38] <%megaman_sentinel> infinity enemy's
[0:40:38] <TehMud> 3D Ninja Gaiden was pretty rad imo. At least the first two anyway
[0:40:40] <%Promessa_EX> It’s on switch and I dabble
[0:40:40] <plushy__poo> Ninja Gaiden me up Orb Daddy
[0:40:40] <%SirGO0SE> As I kid, we didn't know it was bullshit.

[0:40:45] <%Trenr> this game looks great. music is hype.
[0:40:46] <%Alazull> @PatStaresAt A war crime they deserve, the little bastards
[0:40:48] <yourliteraldog> I was 11
[0:40:49] <%Promessa_EX> First level is fine... it’s a trap
[0:40:54] <+kumaprime> ninja gaiden was not a game for children
[0:40:54] <yourliteraldog> So I get it
[0:40:58] <Dragovus> Children don't deserve to not be subject to war crimes
[0:40:59] <dukenux> DR. PROGGERS
[0:40:59] <%YakumoYomi> Ancient Ship of Doom still makes me rage
[0:41:00] <gcaithanos> Huntdown is another amazing new 16-bit side scroller, it is the Cyberpunk that works
[0:41:02] <+strakillias> Ninja Gaiden was the game that killed this style of game for me forever
[0:41:06] <+kumaprime> shit was too hard
[0:41:10] <$ArtoriasTheTrenchfighter> Ninja Gaiden was was designed to eat quarters but it's a console game
[0:41:11] <%McSoliace> even 3d ninja gaiden is BS
[0:41:11] <servicesuspension> yes it was a game for children, who else has the time
[0:41:11] <%crimsonharvest> Those war crimes strengthened us
[0:41:12] <%Infernal_Dalek> You play with your HANDS? That stuffs for babies!
[0:41:13] <sriracha_cream> Ninja Gaiden was not a game for ADULTS

[0:41:43] <Garrison27> Oh man this GME shit is hilarious
[0:41:45] <ExpressNode> I guess this game is a metrodvania type?
[0:41:53] <yourliteraldog> Naruto Run? It better be a Naruto Run!
[0:41:56] <%crimsonharvest> does it being 'cyber' shadow mean they even thought about Kabuki Quantum Fighter even once, which is more than anyone else ever
[0:41:56] <+Crasgnab> interesting weapon system
[0:41:56] <+Arnoldoaad1> Music is super good
[0:42:07] <abuse_of_zeus> Jebaited

[0:42:19] <yourliteraldog> That a check point?
[0:42:19] <+Shady_Zaku> Is Cyber Shadow now the new Messenger?
[0:42:23] <servicesuspension> many people think regularly about Kabuki Quantum Fighter
[0:42:28] <%Taisuru> Can you slash enemy projectlise?
[0:42:30] <Jolnir> catJam
[0:42:32] <%jyeowa> will this VOD be up later?
[0:42:32] <%YakumoYomi> KQF was the shit
[0:42:33] <%Taisuru> *Projectiles
[0:42:35] <%MonsterEnvy> This seems more techy then Ninja Gaiden and Messenger
[0:42:37] <rufus2k2> was that not some kind of healing/save chamber?
[0:42:38] <%miguelrod777> 🔥🔥🔥
[0:42:38] <%crimsonharvest> can you chop the fireballs @PatStaresAt , they're the same orange color as the currencies

[0:42:51] <KaiserMario> Street Fighter 2010 2
[0:42:51] <%MonsterEnvy> Ninja Gaiden had both tech and magic. While Messenger was just magic
[0:42:51] <%Mendin> Megaman 2 bird bombers
[0:42:52] <+BigHooppaw> No crouch?
[0:42:52] <ToneBacas> baby slash
[0:42:53] <+Shady_Zaku> my shit weighed out so I didn't see

[0:43:31] <%twistedj3ster> Oh this game looks hard...why is Pat playing it?
[0:43:41] <servicesuspension> I know this kind of game is comfort food basically, but it's very comfy
[0:43:45] <marvel877> You lost the sword upgrade after 3 hits.
[0:43:51] <ExpressNode> @penitentpendant I think I'm starting to see that now
[0:43:51] <The_Nightmare_Emperor> This soundtrack be bumpin
[0:43:54] <yourliteraldog> Thats a megaman health pick up
[0:43:54] <+coulsoal8> not yet

[0:44:27] <Pookiedaexzile> Egg Pat is good at Ninja Gaiden
[0:44:27] <+FlongBongle> what do you mean, fire isn’t choppable?
[0:44:28] <Torgue_1> You won't even chop suey?
[0:44:30] <%Mendin> I'm liking how generous they're being with the health pickups for Level 1 to aid in your leraning
[0:44:33] <%dd44dostivei> somebody played Shatterhand
[0:44:33] <ammobasket> Give 'im the CHOP
[0:44:34] <@commanderclaw> I did

[0:44:43] <%Promessa_EX> Might be rad if it’s unlockable
[0:44:43] <rufus2k2> nobody beast Sub Zero
[0:44:44] <%Mendin> Not really pulling the punches but letting you facetank as you go
[0:44:44] <penitentpendant> It's the Battle Toads of Ninja Games
[0:44:45] <%TaurusOxford> speedrunners beat it. Kappa
[0:44:45] <+0raison> probably get a projectile parry later on
[0:44:46] <servicesuspension> I've only seen Joel beat Ninja Gaiden in one sitting

[0:44:50] <brunoberserk> ninja gaiden BEATS YOU
[0:44:51] <%BestTeaMaker> if no one beat it, what are those speedrunners doing
[0:44:52] <%Jeemukun> Arin beat it on GG
[0:44:52] <%baka_sugoi> mad men beat ninja gaiden
[0:44:53] <%BoxNavy> we have to get pat to spitebeat ninja gaiden on stream
[0:44:54] <%cowardman93> you get a little further every time
[0:44:54] <%crimsonharvest> NG1 and 2, but 3 was definitely not doable
[0:44:56] <DianaTheAscian> I did... eventually
[0:44:57] <dukenux> i just did :)
[0:44:59] <Pookiedaexzile> I beat sigma twice
[0:44:59] <%purple_bagel> I got like halfway through gaiden II but gave up

[0:48:06] <goose_coward> october 1988 damn
[0:48:12] <%cowardman93> ninja gaiden is older than me by half a decade

[0:48:34] <MyNameIsRasus> ninja gaiden is 11 years older than me damn
[0:48:35] <brunoberserk> simon belmont taught us to ways HIT THE WALL

[0:48:45] <Broken_Sonex> I’ll make you feel old by saying I’m turning 22 today @patstaresat
[0:48:47] <%MonsterEnvy> I thought Ghosts and Goblins was invented by the Devil
[0:48:47] <%SlimeSlimeSlime> Ninja Gaiden is the Dark Souls of the NES era.
[0:48:48] <DianaTheAscian> I thought that was Omikron?
[0:48:48] <%Mendin> Nintendo Hard is a meme for REASONS
[0:48:49] <Torgue_1> Pat, don't talk about the Japanese like that!
[0:48:51] <yourliteraldog> Aka soom Japanese Dudes
[0:48:52] <YaxxbassDK> it's time to chew ass then!
[0:48:54] <penitentpendant> In a time when difficulty was supposed to mean longevity
[0:48:57] <%MonsterEnvy> Who was a Child when Ghosts and Goblins came out
[0:48:57] <%Mendin> and one of those reasons is Ninja Gaiden
[0:48:59] <%YakumoYomi> @crimsonharvest I'm 36, and I'll be there (unless I beat you to the grave first)
[0:49:01] <%linSP> most of my favorite games came out the same year I was born
[0:49:04] <dukenux> That's fine, kids love the Devil
[0:49:08] <yourliteraldog> Pat Rascist Confirmed

[0:49:40] <KaiserMario> Is Ninja Gaiden harder than Castlevania 3?
[0:49:40] <%Daxalog> A chozo statue?
[0:49:40] <rufus2k2> just realized Cyber Shadow passed Pat's "Does the Jump Feel Good" Test
[0:49:45] <BluBox> Big Chozo

[0:50:19] <marvel877> I'm still getting used to the movement in this game because the day before it came out I was playing Bloodstained COTM 2 Veteran style so I feel weird not having stiff movements.

[0:50:26] <rufus2k2> it's why Samus has feathers for underarm hair
[0:50:28] <marvel877> Why can't Metroid crawl?
[0:50:28] <DianaTheAscian> @PatStaresAt whos samus?

[1:11:14] <+RyTYoung> 100% bet there's an achievement for beating the game without upgrading any save points Kappa
[1:11:14] <FourthGuardJuan> Yeah that's the good stuff
[1:11:21] <%Piemono> Ask your Uncle who works at Nintendo to give you cheat codes
[1:11:27] <rufus2k2> @Taisuru true but he can def do more hits without having to replenish it
[1:11:38] <rufus2k2> look at this silly shit
[1:11:39] <servicesuspension> Goodbye Laserbrain, your purpose was unclear. Why were you even in the dump

[1:12:04] <Jnkolm> @Taisuru pretty sure the upgrade just is range not damage
[1:12:06] <+mikesapartment> it turns on THAT machine forever
[1:12:08] <%Toynota10> its permanent for this checkpoint
[1:12:10] <%YakumoYomi> Im-pasta-ble! No one can defeat Laserbrain!
[1:12:12] <%Taisuru> It's permanent for that save point I think
[1:12:12] <rufus2k2> that's what he said
[1:12:13] <justinjones1989> it's not
[1:12:15] <%BoxNavy> wait what
[1:12:17] <+ReallyBigRocks> Just for that checkpoint

[1:12:23] <%PanicSwytch> That checkpoint now has item drops
[1:12:28] <%asgard147> can you change it?

[1:14:59] <%MegboyManuel> MegboyManuel subscribed at Tier 1. They've subscribed for 26 months, currently on a 26 month streak! Wow this game's pixel art is stupid pretty, i love it. Btw FF14 expac trailer possibly coming out next month, any guesses as to what the next expac is? Everyone says Garlemald but I have my doubts on that.
[1:15:02] <Jnkolm> Trash compactor upgraded to Ninja compactor

[1:15:28] <%코코꾸라> Are you winning, son
[1:15:35] <ikantreeed> Did pat have a migraine because his hair were too long, and to heavy for his frail body?
[1:15:44] <+ReallyBigRocks> @MegboyManuel Just came out a few days ago I think
[1:15:49] <%arcielardor> hey Pat, have you tried putting in the konami code?
[1:15:59] <%asgard147> Can you buy all three at once?
[1:16:09] <%MegboyManuel> shit i mighve been oblivious to it's marketting then
[1:16:20] <rufus2k2> @asgard147 of course he can, but this is Pat
[1:16:26] <%Taisuru> LUL
[1:16:27] <servicesuspension> oof
[1:16:27] <Jnkolm> Came out yesterday
[1:16:32] <MonstarGrrrl> perfect
[1:16:35] <+Euphbugg> LUL
[1:16:41] <+Ipsenscastle> I feel like I need this to have a dash and a wall/double jump for me to be able to enjoy it
[1:16:51] <servicesuspension> now we just need bushiden
[1:17:00] <rufus2k2> @Ipsenscastle I feel like those are definitely in this
[1:17:14] <%MegboyManuel> did games of this visual era even have dash and wall jumps??
[1:17:15] <+Ipsenscastle> @rufus2k2 i'm sure eventually
[1:17:22] <Shwepie> Pat's puzzle brain is offline.
[1:17:22] <rufus2k2> no platformer in this day and age can live w/o a double jump
[1:17:25] <%asgard147> How can this be?!
[1:17:28] <LordOfThePoultry> SourPls
[1:17:29] <%crimsonharvest> Ninja Gaiden 1 had walljumps
[1:17:41] <servicesuspension> technically walljumps
[1:17:44] <%MegboyManuel> okay fair enough actually
[1:17:48] <servicesuspension> dash, I don't think so
[1:18:02] <%crimsonharvest> Megaman 3 had dash
[1:18:08] <%wibbwobbler> whoa
[1:18:21] <servicesuspension> slide doesn't really count, too restrictive, I'd say
[1:18:22] <+CaptainTitforce> Damn this game is good, and punishing :<

[1:18:45] <rufus2k2> I wish it had a less generic name but this gameplay is winning me over
[1:18:50] <Jnkolm> The only issue with double jumps is some platformers will make almost every jump a double jump
[1:18:56] <servicesuspension> the fuck's a kuwanger
[1:19:01] <Admiral_PopnFresh> nuuuuuuu
[1:19:04] <rufus2k2> cyber shadow is definitely a game you'd find in an old 80s movie
[1:19:05] <%crimsonharvest> most of the games of this era coulndt have a dedicated dash because there weren't really enough inputs
[1:19:06] <+Euphbugg> LUL

[1:20:27] <+Ipsenscastle> I feel like my perfect version of this kind of game would have hollow knights movement and DMC's timing-based basic combos, like Roulette Spin
[1:20:34] <rufus2k2> poo gas!
[1:20:35] <+ReallyBigRocks> It's clearly fart gas

[1:20:48] <%LymanAl> don't step in the hurty gas
[1:20:55] <%BoxNavy> to annoy pat specifically

[1:21:54] <rufus2k2> remember your shurikens

[1:24:10] <%Taisuru> Sop killing every enemy
[1:24:15] <%Alazull> Super gross
[1:24:19] <Shwepie> Tastes like wall meat.
[1:24:20] <%BoxNavy> chicken with delicious cement and drywall chunks
[1:24:23] <FourthGuardJuan> The robust taste of wall, now in chicken!
[1:24:31] <LVL1_Scumbag> Wish my walls had wall chicken
[1:24:37] <%Alazull> It would probably taste like a fantastic way to get food poisoning
[1:24:44] <servicesuspension> imagine biting a chicken and feeling your bone marrow regenerate in real time
[1:24:46] <+BigHooppaw> Wall chicken and pineapple pizza it is
[1:24:46] <%Taisuru> Oh god he'll never make it out of here
