[0:18:44] <%Corporate_Redeemer> cheer500 Would you ever consider streaming any SMT games? Been thinking about getting into SMT but don't quite know where to start. Also, one of the DLC personas is apparently a massive endgame spoiler and Morgana now has actual cucked dialogue if you romance Ann, which is hilarious
[0:18:47] <+griffball13> bigger number means better product
[0:18:48] <%thenumber5point5> really good, alot better sound than your solo 5

[0:20:35] <+griffball13> ESSENTIAL PRODUCT
[0:20:36] <NekoZen> ESSENTIAL
[0:20:39] <%NitronStreams> sound bars are esswntial
[0:20:40] <%gespenst25> wireless headphones probably will have a delay no matter what. The speed of light isn't fast enough etc.
[0:20:40] <%ospreyworks> So, Pat do you have your stream on a delay so that the sound of the tv and the stream sound is synced?
[0:20:43] <%boogaleeboo> Sound nerds are fucking hard core
[0:20:43] <%spiritofmojave> ESSENTIAL HEADPHONES
[0:20:43] <%thenumber5point5> im sorry chat for derailing the stream
[0:20:44] <%toolofparanoia> My sound bar gets interference whenever i move in front of it
[0:20:47] <CuttleCrow> I can't believe that the TF2 Soldier VA actor died
[0:20:48] <%Harawanagangsta> WE SHOPPIN
[0:21:02] <jman0625> I can't believe Pat died
[0:21:06] <%Dakuu75> if you stream... while listening to someone else's stream... is that rude? to the guy you're listening to.
[0:21:07] <%toolofparanoia> which is hard because its connected to my computer
[0:21:12] <ELuscious> @PatStaresAt hows the weather? :)

[0:21:52] <%cowardman93> don't see why not
[0:21:52] <%thenumber5point5> yes, but the new bars can use HDMI
[0:21:53] <chambatron> Get a piece of copper and make it analog
[0:21:57] <%toolofparanoia> if it has the same port yes
[0:21:58] <%worldbrand> no you need the help of a gnome
[0:22:00] <%Dakuu75> it's jsut speakers... I think they're all plug'n play

Thanks for making my work from home hours and my weird Tuesday-Wednesday weekend weirder. What's a good lesser-known Shonen you would recommend for a long watch?

[0:34:54] <%spiritofmojave> Spanish is so much better than French, granted I'm Puerto Rican and biased :)
[0:34:54] <Ubu2933> Oh fuck you that was afull\
[0:34:56] <%Spec7re> -2 I dunno what you said but 02
[0:34:56] <deviljhojho_> Do you know what they call memes in france?
[0:34:59] <%mechslayer71> Meme is originally a French word I think
[0:34:59] <%realm_forge> Pat speaking French is like getting a steak with extra grease
[0:34:59] <weltschulter> mem
[0:35:02] <deviljhojho_> A meme with cheese
[0:35:05] <%worldbrand> But especially english
[0:35:11] <CrowbarFacelift> your meme's, jack
[0:35:11] <mimi777> spanish is sexier than french!
[0:35:12] <%crislefort> I feel my speaking english is pretty bad, but when I talked to some English speaking person not from the States they ask me from where in the states I am from O.o (I live in Chile)
[0:35:18] <%toolofparanoia> Memes is a language in itself
[0:35:19] <%worldbrand> because it's like three or four meme languages stitched together
[0:35:20] <Ubu2933> ou est la chapot chinois dans cette terrible pun?

[0:35:33] <mike2hands> Of course spanish is better
[0:35:34] <%anticrust> "French does nothing for Pat"
[0:35:36] <+Odyr2001> French is the Kojumbo Language, as it is the most literal and unsubtle language ever
[0:35:36] <%XeroSigmaPrime> @YakumoYomi IKR shits fucking weird. People ask me how I learned it but I'm like, "Ugh I didnt...". Learning from osmosis is some weird shit

[0:37:26] <%legendfather_of_giants> NOCTURNE
[0:37:27] <%psydaku> 4
[0:37:27] <%NovaKnightmare> 3
[0:37:27] <+Kamennoo> nocturne
[0:37:27] <%SaiyanShoto> @MelBrooksKA Don't tell me how to live my life

[0:37:28] <%BubbaRands> 4
[0:37:28] <%Legato_Ambrose> First thing I hear loading in is Pat saying "Doo doo"
[0:37:29] <Grietinius> @SpicyCheeseNips kinda but not really, it's unused content
[0:37:30] <JustinPM> Daaahhhhhgdaa
[0:37:30] <Zayasu> persona 5
[0:37:30] <%starotter70> DDS?
[0:37:31] <%warmnoid> you start with persona 4
[0:37:31] <TheFramedWarlock> Persona 3
[0:37:31] <%optimasmaximas> nocturne?
[0:37:31] <%Dragovus> SMT 5
[0:37:31] <+textandnumbers> nocturne is dope yo
[0:37:32] <%pariahsama> I'd say 3
[0:37:32] <%PocketChange117> @SoFarFetched Imagine a midnight library. Peak culture
[0:37:32] <%aishman> Or Strange Journey
[0:37:33] <%Lunaticbro > devil survivor
[0:37:33] <Abd0022> persona 5
[0:37:33] <+textandnumbers> but very hard
[0:37:36] <%thenumber5point5> Lets do that 100hour neutral run
[0:37:37] <Grietinius> nocturne
[0:37:38] <%Arxel1> Strange Journey? LUL
[0:37:39] <%CaptainBright> Featuring Dante from the Devil May Cry series
[0:37:39] <zamzoph> Production order!
[0:37:39] <%LandOfTheWay> good places to start in SMT is either SMT4 for mainline experience, Strange Journey or Nocturne for the best in the franchise, the Raidou games for action game content, or Devil Survivor if you like SRPGs
[0:37:41] <nyacoo> megami tensei NES
[0:37:42] <+b9k9com> What is SMT?
[0:37:42] <%BubbaRands> START WITH 4
[0:37:43] <%legendfather_of_giants> its nocturne
[0:37:43] <redrins> dds is also great
[0:37:43] <pier_and_loft> nocturne is one of the best video games of all time and it is easier than persona 3
[0:37:44] <%boogaleeboo> Boo, DDS
[0:37:44] <%Bonkasaurusrex> Nocturne
[0:37:45] <%valkuma> smt is bad, persona is good
[0:37:47] <+textandnumbers> persona 3
[0:37:48] <Grietinius> persona 3 Pog
[0:37:49] <zamzoph> @PatStaresAt Which persona 3?
[0:37:51] <%BigCoffee> @PatStaresAt Digital Devil Saga ?
[0:37:53] <%spiritofmojave> Start with DDS?
[0:37:57] <%floralkami> @kewlmyc he'll One Piece it, probably
[0:37:57] <+griffball13> YOU CAN"T GO BACK
[0:37:58] <akman14> Which SMT game has the cooler Furher ?
[0:37:58] <@SSaryn> Nocturne, DDS or 4 is good.
[0:37:59] <%Daniel_Is_I> Guys, it's Tokyo Mirage Sessions
[0:38:00] <%Ranryu692> I tried playing Persona 1 recently, and OOF
[0:38:00] <bendatron> dds probably p3 nocturne 4 any of those
[0:38:00] <%masterpiecejeremy> @PatStaresAt it's obivous you need to start with the VR dancing games
[0:38:01] <arkv01> actually, start at Raidou
[0:38:05] <pier_and_loft> DDS is fun but weaker because it has no press turn system
[0:38:05] <Grietinius> Raidou kuzonoha Kreygasm
[0:38:06] <%legendfather_of_giants> @zamzoph FES, fight me
[0:38:11] <%aishman> @PatStaresAt I would recommend Strange Journey actually. It's probably the best one (it also leads to SMT4)
[0:38:11] <%viewtifulr> why not ghost?
[0:38:12] <+Greywyn00> just wait until SMT5 comes out.... in 2022 Kappa
[0:38:13] <+SpicyCheeseNips> @Grietinius Good to know. Thanks
[0:38:14] <%genowyn> The real answer is: Any game with a press turn system because press turn is the greatest jrpg battle system ever made
[0:38:16] <%BallerSwagBro9k> Im playing P3 for the 1st time now
[0:38:20] <%valriot> MARIN FUCKING KARIN
[0:38:21] <%Joestar1890> That's me with P1-P3
[0:38:22] <Scotaku> OH MY GOD WHY
[0:38:24] <%CaptainBright> Rolling for skills is H E L L in Nocturne
[0:38:25] <%logoth_> Theres no time
[0:38:27] <%starotter70> Yeaaaaaah
[0:38:28] <%BubbaRands> P3P IS ALRIGHT BUT ITS PSP
[0:38:29] <%dekkitout> "I can't believe *feature* wasn't always a thing!?"
[0:38:30] <%Arxel1> @Scotaku Becasue FUCK YOU
[0:38:32] <%cvp5127> play p3p instead
[0:38:33] <%AgniBrandt> AgniBrandt subscribed with Twitch Prime. They've subscribed for 15 months! Well, you successfully convinced me to buy P5R, and I'm just before the fifth palace now. How are you liking the new confidants so far? I'm a huge fan of Maruki, as a psych grad.
[0:38:36] <%BallerSwagBro9k> And Golden is only on Vita BibleThump
[0:38:36] <%Daniel_Is_I> HOPE YOU LIKE MASHING XX-OO-XX-OO FOR FUSION
[0:38:37] <%Joestar1890> It's why I bought P3P
[0:38:37] <+SpicyCheeseNips> Man I can NEVER go back to P4, especially Golden. It sucks!
[0:38:37] <%aishman> MARIN
[0:38:38] <@SSaryn> P2 IS on PSP if you wanna get old school I guess.

[0:38:47] <%Legato_Ambrose> yikes
[0:38:48] <%legendfather_of_giants> @PatStaresAt I just prefer actually seeing your demons in Nocturne instead of how IV does it
[0:38:48] <CrowbarFacelift> that's no good
[0:38:48] <+Merhabi> P3p is ALMOST the best version
[0:38:49] <%YakumoYomi> I don't wanna try to fight this love. How dangerous...can it be?
[0:38:52] <arkv01> press turn feels amazing because it's like doing the mating press I will never do IRL Kreygasm
[0:38:53] <+Odyr2001> Just play Pes
[0:38:53] <MSN04_Sazabi> KARIN MARIN
[0:38:53] <Grietinius> but p3p is just a graphic novel LUL
[0:38:53] <%SilverDevilfish> M A R I N K A R I N
[0:38:54] <%Reveresao> I could not play P3 because of that
[0:38:56] <%Daniel_Is_I> @PatStaresAt There is a mod if you emulate P3Fes that gives you control
[0:38:57] <%BallerSwagBro9k> Use P3P Rom
[0:38:58] <filialpails> there's a patch for P3FES that lets you control them
[0:39:00] <%weissguard> Marin Karin always works for me LUL
[0:39:01] <%riantDeliration> That killed P3 for me honestly
[0:39:01] <%Quigsies> You can mod p3 to have controllable party members on pc
[0:39:02] <%Lunaticbro > marin karin
[0:39:02] <%crimsonphoenix69> P1 and P2 you can
[0:39:02] <%aishman> I refuse to have Marin Karin in anyone because of P3
[0:39:02] <%pariahsama> you control you party in all the mainline SMT games

[0:41:17] <%GohanHitsugaya> psaCanada
[0:41:17] <%realm_forge> THE FUN TYLENOL
[0:41:23] <+griffball13> usa does not do that i think
[0:41:25] <CrowbarFacelift> I get the tension headaches that extend to jaw/neck, shit is the worst
[0:41:31] <%dekkitout> Do yall not have an opioid crisis up there?
[0:41:33] <uhdinocat> yeah cant get codeine tylenol in us
[0:41:35] <%floralkami> @xerosigmaprime probably because they have a better drug abuse prevention system...
[0:41:35] <%Futurecity10> Best place to get into smt is 4, and watch germanspys series on nocturne
[0:41:36] <%PocketChange117> US says no no lol
[0:41:38] <%CopperTucker> Codeine makes me so sick that I can't have it :D I almost died when I first had it.
[0:41:38] <%thenumber5point5> ya, cant get ther shit here with aout a drug test from your doctor
[0:41:38] <%Aydarkzero> Cabnada got that good stuff Kappa
[0:41:39] <%Ancopro> wat
[0:41:42] <Jetsfantasy> Yeah, no, goodluck getting Tylenol with Codeine in the US
[0:41:43] <+Odyr2001> Did the US stop that because of the tylenol tampering?
[0:41:43] <%XeroSigmaPrime> Codeine Tylenol is available in US over the counter...
[0:41:44] <%masterpiecejeremy> @XeroSigmaPrime We sell the tylenol codeine mix over the counter but keep them behind and track them on your pharmacy profile
[0:41:44] <transporterthesequel> Same, Migraine’s can go to hell
[0:41:46] <%Jp3g95> I think here its a regulated subsatance
[0:41:54] <+SpicyCheeseNips> I had a bad headache as a kid once. I fell on the floor and a teacher yelled at me. Good times lol
[0:41:54] <indominus_corgi> codine is controlled in the us
[0:41:56] <%Ancopro> u can buy a gun but not tylenol?
[0:41:56] <uhdinocat> to be fair, we have lots of prescription drug problemos
[0:41:58] <%valkuma> jojo

[0:42:03] <%NoHoldsBarredProductions> @dekkitout We don't like to talk about it
[0:42:07] <fearhurst> @PatStaresAt it is limited in the US because people put the codeine in drinks to get the high

[0:43:10] <filialpails> soulless army is 1, king abaddon is 2
[0:43:10] <%Bonkasaurusrex> So mad that the second Raidou game didnt get a PAL release.
[0:43:14] <Grietinius> raidou 2 has better gameplay
[0:43:15] <arkv01> no NO FLAW
[0:43:16] <%nictron90> Which was the one with robot rasputin
[0:43:17] <%XeroSigmaPrime> @floralkami Fuck this shit. I sprained my ankle two weeks ago and its killing me. Appointment is 5 weeks away, I need some strong pain shit :(

[0:43:57] <%weissguard> That's horseshit.
[0:43:58] <%pariahsama> Yep gotta fight in line for check out!
[0:43:59] <+SpicyCheeseNips> FUCK OFF WITH THAT
[0:44:01] <%NoctisxMog> Narumi's shop
[0:44:01] <%Valdorick> Walking in cutscene? Random Battle
[0:44:04] <%BubbaRands> YEAH THAT SUCKS
[0:44:05] <%Aydarkzero> ???
[0:44:05] <zenorot> random battle encounter is too high?
[0:44:06] <%CopperTucker> @PatStaresAt yeah, Raidou 1 has that problem pretty bad. The second one is so much better
[0:44:06] <%Corporate_Redeemer> RAIDOU-CHAN!!!
[0:44:07] <%NoHoldsBarredProductions> Shut the game off: random battles.
[0:44:09] <OldManDeckardCain> RANDOM BATTLE ERVERYWHERE SYSTEM
[0:44:12] <uhdinocat> you should play Yakuza 0, just you this time, just saying
[0:44:12] <arkv01> having sex in the bedroom? RANDOM BATTLES
[0:44:18] <%starotter70> I hear the 2nd is much better
[0:44:20] <%viewtifulr> Interactions in real life are battles pat
[0:44:20] <%Reveresao> taking a shit random? boss battle
[0:44:20] <%spiritofmojave> breathing?
[0:44:21] <CuttleCrow> random battles have random battles
[0:44:24] <%spiritofmojave> random battles
[0:44:25] <%segonian> taking a shit? random battles
[0:44:38] <%reonome> YO HO YO HO
[0:44:41] <%Corporate_Redeemer> Expecting a random battle? Nope. Chuck Testa
[0:44:41] <%floralkami> @xerosigmaprime damn, why life had to cut you down shorter?
[0:44:42] <TheFranss> O yeah. That one guy who leveled Cloud to 99 in the very beginning is just nuts
[0:44:44] <filialpails> it works on PCSX2
[0:44:44] <%XeroSigmaPrime> @masterpiecejeremy Wow thats alot better than the US system. A friend of mine whose a pharmacist say they track through health provider, not actual ID of person... Dude can abuse the shit out of something if he goes to two different providers...
[0:44:46] <%PR0swagonist> The battle theme is a banger
[0:44:47] <vonmaultke> Random battles boost my XP
[0:44:47] <+SpicyCheeseNips> Whats that SMT game where the dudes turn into their Demons?
[0:44:53] <%pariahsama> gotta love his coat
[0:44:54] <%nictron90> I think you can buy it on the PS3 PSN store in some regions
[0:44:54] <%aishman> @PatStaresAt Any change of maybe Strange Journey? It's probably Atlus's best pure dungeon crawler and the story leads to SMT4
[0:44:54] <bendatron> is the psn ps3 version not good
[0:44:54] <%BubbaRands> Maybe when Atlus gets their shit together AND RELEASES THEM ON PC
[0:44:55] <%CursedNobleman> The SMT Virgin vs the Etrian Odyssey Chad
[0:44:57] <Grietinius> the music is Kreygasm
[0:44:58] <@commanderclaw> y no port :_:
[0:44:59] <%reonome> digital devil saga
[0:45:02] <%starotter70> The final boss theme of 1st game is fire
[0:45:03] <%aishman> Or chance rather
[0:45:03] <+SpicyCheeseNips> Ooooh
[0:45:04] <%Bonkasaurusrex> DDS is SO GOOD
[0:45:05] <deviljhojho_> that one was REALLY wacky
[0:45:05] <%BubbaRands> DDS
[0:45:07] <zamzoph> No John
[0:45:12] <+NitronStreams> You are the demons
[0:45:13] <%logoth_> John. YOU are the demonz
[0:45:14] <%pectusumbra> and how does that rank up?
[0:45:15] <Kirijuo> I own the special edition with the Raidou Jack Frost Plush
[0:45:17] <%aishman> Maybe we'll get them on the switch along with SMT5
[0:45:17] <bendatron> dds is so good
[0:45:18] <%XeroSigmaPrime> @floralkami BRB gonna break across the closed border to get some stronger shit
[0:45:19] <%vonepic> DDS features Dante from the devil may cry series?
[0:45:21] <deviljhojho_> content is content
[0:45:22] <%PR0swagonist> Atlus just bring SMT to PC you cowards
[0:45:23] <%starotter70> Man, the ps2 SMT games were so good
[0:45:23] <%Daniel_Is_I> P4G probably needs to be ported more than anything else since it's in Vita Jail
[0:45:24] <%LandOfTheWay> Raidou 3 made by Platinum is still my dream
[0:45:24] <shiny_prinny> some of them are stuck on the PS3
[0:45:24] <filialpails> PS2 era best atlus era
[0:45:24] <%Corporate_Redeemer> ATLUS MUST REMEMBER P1 AND P2
[0:45:26] <%BallerSwagBro9k> I want P4 GOLDEN AND P3P ON PC BibleThump
[0:45:27] <+Wiithan6> I would kill for an SMT collection of some sort
[0:45:28] <Zayasu> :) 👍
[0:45:29] <fearhurst> unfug his brain
[0:45:34] <%masterpiecejeremy> @PatStaresAt you should try the Game of Thrones RPG Atlus published. Plays like an old school bioware rpg
[0:45:34] <deviljhojho_> crikGood
[0:45:35] <%dekkitout> Brain Bootup: Complete
[0:45:37] <%psydaku> wat about the PS3 ports?
[0:45:40] <+SpicyCheeseNips> POOP? LOL
[0:45:40] <@SSaryn> DDS is still a pretty high recommend from the SMT community so ye it gud
[0:45:44] <cureneckbeard> Just as keikaku
[0:45:44] <+OhioNitsud> is it p5 or ff7 today?
[0:45:45] <%Daniel_Is_I> I was legitimately contemplating dropping $200 on a vita + mem card + P4G
[0:45:58] <uhdinocat> shit eating grin
[0:45:58] <Zayasu> this is fine :)
[0:46:01] <%Ynkubus18> Pats a muppet
[0:46:02] <%floralkami> @xerosigmaprime bring back some weed for me while you're at it (jk, i quit a whole ago)
[0:46:03] <deviljhojho_> tomatoSmile 👍
[0:46:03] <%legendfather_of_giants> @Daniel_Is_I do it, that's what I did
[0:46:04] <%starotter70> psaUp
[0:46:06] <%Odyr2001> Gifable material
[0:46:07] <%Ranryu692> yikes
[0:46:09] <%segonian> I was told that the difference between persona and SMT is stand users and Pokemon. Is that true?

[0:46:16] <%aslfrasle> @Daniel_Is_I You don't need a Vita, just get a PSTV if you can, it's quite a fair bit cheaper.
[0:46:16] <%NitronStreams> 🎵🎵🎵🎵🎵🎵🎵🎵🎵🎵
[0:46:17] <%BallerSwagBro9k> SourPls
[0:46:22] <cureneckbeard> like konosuba
[0:46:23] <%masterpiecejeremy> @XeroSigmaPrime You only have one profile here. You can't open another one in another pharmacy because it's tied to your govt insurance. You can only transfer it along with your medical history
[0:46:24] <uhdinocat> DONT TELL ELMO WHAT TO DO
[0:46:24] <%hawk_rush> intro was skipped :(
[0:46:25] <%legendfather_of_giants> @segonian yes, except SMT came out before Pokemon
[0:46:31] <%Daniel_Is_I> @aslfrasle I looked for PS TVs, they're more expensive than vitas now
[0:46:31] <%floralkami> Pat just called himself a hitch
[0:46:34] <%reonome> SourPls
[0:46:35] <%weissguard> Did that to a customer one time when I worked in retail. Felt so good.
[0:46:36] <Crimpson> Does playing this game on easy change anything with the story?
[0:46:37] <%Spec7re> Elmo is the man of the house you must respect him
[0:46:38] <%floralkami> *bitch
[0:46:39] <%ospreyworks> Ngl, Atlus kinda sounds like Konami, as far as the love for their old titles
[0:46:43] <%aslfrasle> That's weird... I wonder what happened?
[0:46:43] <%Daniel_Is_I> GRINDMAN
[0:46:46] <Zayasu> LUL
[0:46:48] <%cvp5127> only 5?
[0:46:48] <%GohanHitsugaya> LUL

[0:46:50] <%Odyr2001> BIG LEVELS
[0:46:50] <%shurtal> Grind Hardman
[0:46:50] <%starotter70> mmm?
[0:46:51] <%maenos2> Hah
[0:46:51] <appletumtum> Hmm
[0:46:51] <CrowbarFacelift> so I did some grinding off camera...
[0:46:52] <%LandOfTheWay> SO I'VE BEEN GRINDING OFF SCREEN
[0:46:52] <+SpicyCheeseNips> Nah man its cool
[0:46:53] <%PR0swagonist> pat HOW
[0:46:53] <%hawk_rush> SO I'VE BEEN GRINDING A LITTLE
[0:46:54] <uhdinocat> mysteriously
[0:46:54] <%Ynkubus18> A wizard did it!
[0:46:55] <%Engwithan_Elder_God> Only 5?
[0:46:56] <%reonome> "so I've been doing a bit of grinding offscreen"
[0:46:57] <TheFranss> SO I HAVE BEEN LEVELING OFF SCREEN LUL
[0:46:57] <%BallerSwagBro9k> GRIND HARDMAN
[0:46:58] <TDAWS_MP132> MATADOR!

[0:47:02] <BoomerxDoomer> yes it is
[0:47:02] <%aslfrasle> I got one for like $25-$30 i think.
[0:47:03] <%Valdorick> Negitive Worry about that
[0:47:05] <%floralkami> motherfucking what?
[0:47:05] <+SquishMittens7> larrThumb
[0:47:05] <%DrFacilier> Remember Dark Souls 3
[0:47:05] <redrins> cheeky hugey?
[0:47:05] <zenorot> raidou should definitely be in another SMT game as a encounter
[0:47:05] <%Engwithan_Elder_God> I'm not worried, but what is important?
[0:47:05] <%BubbaRands> IM WORRIED ABOUT THAT
[0:47:07] <%Daniel_Is_I> Oh yeah, Shiki is lv18 now, not like 40
[0:47:07] <@commanderclaw> MATADOR
[0:47:08] <@SSaryn> Honestly, as long as you're not over Level 25, you're good.
[0:47:08] <cureneckbeard> ruined
[0:47:08] <CrowbarFacelift> We Dark Souls 3 now?!
[0:47:09] <%nictron90> I see you're wearing the silver knight set too
[0:47:11] <%YakumoYomi> @aslfrasle Only if you can find one in stores. PSTVs have gone up pretty high in price online, as they're discontinued and apparently very rare.
[0:47:11] <%Deano8817> yeyeye
[0:47:11] <uhdinocat> is elmo?
[0:47:12] <cureneckbeard> woolie should have been the chosen one
[0:47:12] <%Legato_Ambrose> When you get Ryuji leveled up, are you going to do a whole stream grinding in Mementos? @PatStaresAt
[0:47:13] <%NitronStreams> *OFF SCREEN INTENSIFIES*
[0:47:14] <@SSaryn> also yeyeyeyeye Matador
[0:47:17] <CriticKitten> "Been doing a bit of grinding offstream"
[0:47:18] <%schlager087> 5 levels? Pat's doing so good at restraining himself
[0:47:18] <%floralkami> ........
[0:47:19] <%valriot> I walked into Sae palace with Yoshitsune, you're fine
[0:47:19] <%starotter70> Aight
[0:47:20] <%extradopeness> Matador sick af
[0:47:21] <%cvp5127> any new scenes?

[0:47:30] <TheFranss> Am I back to that one Yakuza 4 walkthrough LUL
[0:47:32] <%Garthunox> it's a pity you didnt have an audience for matador
[0:47:32] <%Kingjhon8> #GRINDDD
[0:47:33] <%crimsonharvest> oh god the temporal distortion on Twitch is RUINING the music on my connection today
[0:47:34] <%GabeSweetMan> HOW?
[0:47:37] <@SSaryn> That's fucking early for that shit
[0:47:38] <%hawk_rush> that's my goal
[0:47:40] <%Garthunox> THATS MESSED UP
[0:47:45] <%Corporate_Redeemer> @segonian Difference is a more pokemon-esque system with multiple demons out at a time. SMT games have strict ending requirements and routes (Law, Neutral, Chaos) and are more darker in themes
[0:47:47] <+Wiithan6> you'd have to be on ng+ for that yeah?

Can we take a second to appreciate the fact that with no powers yet Yusuke fell from the fucking sky, landed on his feet, and caught Ann. Going through the game again reminded me of how he was pretty much on top of metaverse stuff from the start.
[1:15:22] <@SoFarFetched> Morgana probably wished his dick landed on Ann LUL

[1:16:51] <%DensityD> that's respectable
[1:16:51] <%rumtumtugnutz> cheese it-the cops! A warning that the police were coming. “Cheese” might be a variant of “cease.” It might also come from the cheese course coming at the end of dinner; in the sense that with nothing else ahead, it's time to leave. In either event, “cheese it—the cops!” was a staple of mid-20th-century crime novels and films, as well as such movies as The Dead End Kids and The Bowery Boys.
[1:16:56] <+knowyourenemy_97> that don't sound cool at all
[1:16:56] <%Shikari21> just wait a bit LUL

[1:21:18] <Fulmork> a con artist is still an artist right?
[1:21:20] <%gear1033> Hey guys I am on a budget and I can only afford one game my choices are Final Fantasy 7, Persona 5 Royal, or Animal Crossing which should I get?

[1:21:21] <%rumtumtugnutz> It hasn't been released in North America yet, so far its Japan only
[1:21:22] <%za7az> @Zombrocom I think it's more so that Shadow's think they are invincible and can't be stopped so they don't care to lie
[1:21:23] <%Zebroneath> How can someone be so evil?
[1:21:24] <%hawk_rush> it's weird that Atlust goes for the plagiarism angle, and not the "has made students commit suicide" angle
[1:21:24] <+knowyourenemy_97> And artist, more like a scammer!
[1:21:24] <%SilverDevilfish> Makes art but doesn't respect art... is Madarame Pat? Kappa

[1:25:07] <%Aydarkzero> makes sense
[1:25:07] <red_cuppa> dat smile tho
[1:25:08] <ovan20> No Pat, it hurts as fuck Yusuke just pretends it doesn't hurt to be artish fartish Keepo
[1:25:09] <%SvenHolgersson> THAT DAMN SMILE

[1:25:15] <%GabeSweetMan> SLASHERSMILE is great
[1:25:15] <%Shikari21> Morgana gets benched for yuske LUL

[1:25:18] <chambatron> Those guys look cool
[1:25:20] <%heartlesshealer> Oh!
[1:25:22] <%floralkami> ngl, that was a good shit eating grin
[1:25:25] <MKUltima> His real mask were the nails he made bloody
[1:25:27] <%GabeSweetMan> In fact he tore it off with a FLOURISH
[1:25:29] <%logoth_> Jojo pose
[1:25:30] <+j_mac2> DIO POSE!
[1:25:32] <%TheMattman1313> Cuz he's got HUGE GUTS
[1:25:33] <%SvenHolgersson> It's probably due to all the years of lying to himself
[1:25:33] <%Spec7re> POSE
[1:25:35] <%Joestar1890> Maybe Yusuke has no more inner conflict after the monologue Madarame gave him
[1:25:35] <solidus_twitch> it could be that he is less opposed to his true self
[1:25:36] <+knowyourenemy_97> I thought Yusuke was just anime anime compare to everyone else
[1:25:36] <%GabeSweetMan> JOOOJOOOOOOO
[1:25:37] <Crimpson> I think the harder it is to remove the mask is a symbol of acceptance of the persona. Yusuke accepted this more easily
[1:25:37] <%Shikari21> DIO PogChamp
[1:25:37] <Yukai_Yami> Joker IS the only one to have trouble keeping his costume on at the start
[1:25:39] <%DensityD> is this a jojo reference?
[1:25:39] <+SpicyCheeseNips> THATS JUST DIO
[1:25:42] <+BlueJoneleth> well Yusuke is physically the strongest party member
[1:25:43] <arkv01> the english VA can't possibly hope to match sugita, good attempt though
[1:25:46] <%Treuan> I could see it being from him being more connected with his inner self

[1:27:05] <%ospreyworks> Hahaha, just realized he snuck a Critical Role reference in
[1:27:09] <%GabeSweetMan> I DO THINK that's kinda cheap of the game.
[1:27:15] <%GabeSweetMan> YOOOOOO
[1:27:18] <%Garthunox> The Japanese voice acting for Persona 5 sucks, prove me wrong
[1:27:19] <Damie904> Damn Ryuji
[1:27:25] <%Shikari21> Is pat playing on normal difficulty?
[1:27:28] <%BigCoffee> yes
[1:27:31] <%Kingjhon8> psaBig psaWrong
[1:27:31] <%Shikari21> cool
[1:27:32] <%SvenHolgersson> FREAKING BOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOORING
[1:27:32] <%GabeSweetMan> Good job Good Boy Ryuji
[1:27:33] <%ospreyworks> Matt Mercer is cool
[1:27:33] <%DensityD> good job skull....I guess
[1:27:35] <%PR0swagonist> I mean Pat used Ippon-datara, he should know he's pretty strong
[1:27:36] <+SpicyCheeseNips> Rifles are good for painting your enemies with bullets!
[1:27:36] <%satans_finest_millennial> fox can get an Ar 15
[1:27:37] <%DensityD> I'm here for Fox
[1:27:39] <%ElMaestroChoque> its morphin time
[1:27:40] <@SoFarFetched> Yeah it's on Normal.
[1:27:40] <%SvenHolgersson> SKULL IS GOOD
[1:27:42] <@StridentSong> It's because the mask is the representation of their internal beliefs versus how they present themselves/how they believe they are. Yusuke readily accepts that he was wrong and is fairly close between his two personalities, versus someone like the next character you gets struggles to get it off because of the rebel personality versus how she presents herself
[1:27:44] <fearhurst> damn, we lost
[1:27:48] <@StridentSong> At least that's my theory
[1:27:50] <%Piemen99> WHAT A LOSER SKULL I LOVE HIM
[1:27:51] <%heartlesshealer> @BlueJoneleth Best I can think is nuclear destroys the body, while psi destroys the mind. Nuclear used to be the "all"/unblockable element in older games
[1:27:52] <+evbites> it wasn't bright
[1:27:55] <+knowyourenemy_97> A samurai fox who shots a assault rifle is cool
[1:27:58] <@StridentSong> The councilor actually brings this up in Royal
[1:27:59] <%Hellarussian> hes doing him a favor
[1:28:02] <+albedo455> OH ON
[1:28:03] <%narusao> IT'S THE ELMO SHOW! psaWink
[1:28:04] <+albedo455> NO
[1:28:07] <%DensityD> and doesn't afraid of anything
[1:28:09] <%TalisKanju> YOU'RE MISSING THE PLOT
[1:28:12] <%UvBenServed> psaWink
[1:28:13] <gekizenbu> oh no madarame is going to make a callout post
[1:28:14] <%BubbaRands> WELL START RUING!

[1:28:16] <+PunishedMercer_> oh man, that english dub is so good though right?

[1:28:21] <+PunishedMercer_> yikes
[1:28:23] <%Garthunox> oops sorry
[1:28:23] <%SvenHolgersson> Joker just like standing there lol
[1:28:28] <%narusao> get 'em Elmo!
[1:28:29] <%GabeSweetMan> @StridentSong That's a strong theory tbh. I'd believe that was absolutely the intention.
[1:28:29] <%floralkami> @stridentsong damn, horrible timing
[1:28:29] <%weissguard> @StridentSong That makes sense. Especially with the two after the one you're referring to and their respective awakenings.
[1:28:30] <Dr_Mooose> just chilling in the lobby
[1:28:39] <%heartlesshealer> Elmo so relaxed
[1:28:41] <topendbuzza> look at joker LUL
[1:28:41] <%SvenHolgersson> CUZ HE WAS DADDY
[1:28:42] <waverunner56> Was about to say that Mooose
[1:28:43] <@SoFarFetched> Yeah cause I feel like Yusuke got his Persona a lot faster than the others.
[1:28:44] <+SpicyCheeseNips> Why you so stupid, stupid?
[1:28:48] <%shaidot> drums in this song are really nice
[1:28:50] <%SvenHolgersson> DADDY NOT BAD DADDY GOOOD
[1:28:53] <+EySoyCoco> IM FUCKING POOR YO
[1:28:54] <%reonome> is he tho
[1:28:59] <MSN04_Sazabi> OR IS HE?
[1:29:00] <%floralkami> @patstaresat Strident had words for you
[1:29:02] <%hawk_rush> @SoFarFetched I think Haru's is the fastest, no?
[1:29:03] <+knowyourenemy_97> "Yosuke never wanna be homeless..."
[1:29:03] <fearhurst> i was raised by wolves
[1:29:05] <%Garthunox> @stridentsong but ryuji was pretty rebellious and he had a lot of trouble taking his off
[1:29:09] <%GabeSweetMan> Yes an "accident"
[1:29:10] <sjcodan> Orphans are a dumb bitch
[1:29:11] <theangryguyofde> When does Elmo go to Pat Palace to find out how bad his dad is NotLikeThis
[1:29:12] <%SvenHolgersson> Cuz kids are dumb as FUCJKKKKKKKKKKKK
[1:29:13] <IntrovertsGuild> Aw man those ORPHANS
[1:29:13] <%Aydarkzero> cause they're lonely
[1:29:15] <+SpicyCheeseNips> Cuz their parents didn't teach them any better!
[1:29:16] <%tigerfang86> Orphans are DUMB cause they want FAMILIAL BONDS AND GUIDANCE
[1:29:19] <%dekkitout> Cause their hearts are fragile- or some anime bs
[1:29:20] <%Totally_not_toby> cause they have tons of issues obviously
[1:29:20] <%GabeSweetMan> PLUCK THOSE ORPHANS
[1:29:21] <@SoFarFetched> @hawk_rush This is my first time seeing P5 gameplay,so Im going by so far with Ann and Ryuji.
[1:29:27] <T_Sasquatch> Looool
[1:29:30] <%Jekado> yeah Orphans should of known better they parents should of taught them better is probably why...
[1:29:31] <%Lunaticbro > it's like they didn't have parents to teach them
[1:29:32] <waverunner56> i was raised by a man who pays in exposure
[1:29:34] <%pectusumbra> boy is he gonna be pissed
[1:29:35] <+SpicyCheeseNips> It's not even his painting lol
[1:29:39] <%hawk_rush> @SoFarFetched oh sorry, didn't mean to spoil!
[1:29:46] <TioXyco> The fact that he knew is what makes me think he pulled his mask so easily. he just unclouded his eyes to the truth he already knew, so.... He just channeled that rebelion easier
[1:29:47] <asurite_warrior> @PatStaresAt Pretty sure if your father was a shit bag, but overall a decent good father you'd probably thing he wasn't a shit bag
[1:29:50] <%Zombrocom> @SpicyCheeseNips We don't know that yet though
[1:29:52] <%BubbaRands> you good fam
[1:30:00] <%GabeSweetMan> "Man these dumb orphans. Should've had parents so they wouldn't be so duuumb."
[1:30:07] <%Aydarkzero> wut
[1:30:07] <%GabeSweetMan> Good job pat
[1:30:09] <@SoFarFetched> @hawk_rush Hey no problem SeemsGood I wasn't specific with my sentence so it probably made it sound like I knew all the info.

[1:30:20] <%logoth_> If orphans are so great how come their parents are dead
[1:30:20] <Crimpson> See deep down he kind of knew what was happening so taking the mask off was easier because he knew and accepted it easier
[1:30:20] <+Tacowavable> jph4reel
[1:30:20] <%Zombrocom> Thanks pat, for ruining that
[1:30:21] <%Joestar1890> For. Real.

[1:31:05] <+knowyourenemy_97> Scramble!
[1:31:07] <TheDo_DoGuy> is that why joker ripping his off was a rough process
[1:31:10] <fearhurst> Zonks, Scub!
[1:31:10] <%UvBenServed> Why do I have a tail buttplug?
[1:31:11] <dakkster> if pat took off his mask it would take his whole face off
[1:31:13] <%DensityD> bossu coffee
[1:31:14] <@SoFarFetched> oh right I forgot about that twitch update
[1:31:14] <californaya> why do their footsteps splash
[1:31:16] <+albedo455> Con's canned
[1:31:19] <%DensityD> C O F F E E
[1:31:20] <californaya> is that just in that heart/realm
[1:31:24] <theangryguyofde> Pat has another mask underneath his mask like his Fatal Fury hats
[1:31:25] <@StridentSong> Pat's mask would just fall off on it's own
[1:31:29] <%Hellarussian> you are the phantom menaces
[1:31:30] <%GabeSweetMan> Is Yusuke the only one who goes to a different school?
[1:31:30] <%JumbleJams> @californaya mind juice
[1:31:34] <Meekest> Pat's mask is a paper bag with holes
[1:31:36] <%reonome> pat's mask would be on his butt
[1:31:38] <californaya> I see
[1:31:39] <%za7az> Say it louder so the booth beside you can hear
[1:31:46] <%BallerSwagBro9k> @StridentSong What about Paige?
[1:31:46] <tubit> typical kids hanging around for ages, sharing a single coffee
[1:31:49] <waverunner56> What would Pat's forklore rebel persona be?
[1:31:54] <TheFramedWarlock> BOY I SURE LOVE BEING A PHANTOM THIEF
[1:31:55] <+evbites> pat's would slide off like a pizza on a glass pane
[1:31:55] <supertrigun> jph4reel Sorry Pat blew my Twitch Prime on this
[1:31:56] <fearhurst> Pat is sucked into the zoomer device
[1:31:56] <%GabeSweetMan> Paige's mask would crumble off her face.
[1:31:58] <topendbuzza> let's talk about this in a cafe
[1:31:59] <+netrac> We kinda need a graphic artist
[1:31:59] <%BubbaRands> I guess Yusuke is homeless now
[1:32:00] <%DensityD> "btw I'm joining you guys"
[1:32:04] <%rumtumtugnutz> sbfpYeyeye sbfpPatschwitz sbfpSweetbaby sbfpLiam sipsipRude sipsipGasm sipsipDab
[1:32:07] <%realm_forge> Nah, just off the old fart
[1:32:13] <@StridentSong> Paige might struggle a bit, but it'd come off with one hand. She's be like Ann level struggling
[1:32:14] <%floralkami> Pat's mask would be his own face coming off to show a toilet head
[1:32:17] <%Valentinius_Anodyne> @waverunner56 Diogenes of course
[1:32:18] <T_Sasquatch> This game shits itself at futaba then dies in the burger king palace for me
[1:32:19] <+knowyourenemy_97> awwww
[1:32:29] <%GoopyEuclid> I want to give this poor boy a hug. :(
[1:32:30] <%starotter70> Pat's mask would be a toilet
[1:32:34] <%weissguard> Paige probably awakened off screen, we just didn't get to see it until the DLC.
[1:32:38] <%GabeSweetMan> Personer
[1:32:42] <%Garthunox> Pat's mask would be toilet seat
[1:32:46] <waverunner56> @Valentinius_Anodyne He'd excel at filling enemies in despair, even enemies immune to dispair
[1:32:46] <%DrFacilier> What would Pats persona mask be
[1:32:47] <HannibalBeerus> "they may have a mental shutdown" good thing that plot point never gets used
[1:32:48] <%Joestar1890> But what if Crazy Talk
[1:32:48] <Scotaku> pAtSoNa
[1:32:48] <%GohanHitsugaya> Same
[1:32:49] <%Aydarkzero> whats the Persona Version of Crazy Talk?
[1:32:50] <%Hellarussian> the toilet was inside my heart all along
[1:32:52] <%reonome> HEY ALL WE'RE THE PHANTOM THIEVES
[1:32:54] <%bluefooddye1> Pat
[1:32:56] <Dr_Mooose> unless
[1:32:58] <Fulmork> Goblin the Phantom Thief
[1:32:59] <%dekkitout> Nah, paint the dicks
[1:33:03] <%SvenHolgersson> DUMP
[1:33:04] <%SvenHolgersson> EM
[1:33:06] <%SvenHolgersson> OUTTTTTTTT
[1:33:06] <californaya> Pat would go through a traumatic moment to unleash his Persona but the unveiling of it would be blase as fuck
[1:33:08] <zenorot> Futaba palace feels too much like P4
[1:33:11] <%pectusumbra> Futaba's dungeon is great, but burger dungeon is bad and I hope they tuned it up enough in this
[1:33:12] <%toolofparanoia> PAINT HIS DICK
[1:33:14] <%GabeSweetMan> He just wants to paint your JUSTICE Ann.
[1:33:14] <%DrFacilier> @Garthunox a Goblin mask 100%
[1:33:15] <sjcodan> Woolie would need a crowbar
[1:33:16] <%UvBenServed> THERE WAS NO OTHER WAY
[1:33:16] <%PR0swagonist> Would Pat's persona be Belphegor in a gamer cube?
[1:33:16] <%Hellarussian> she is
[1:33:17] <@StridentSong> She probably was
[1:33:18] <%optimasmaximas> LUL
[1:33:18] <%Masamune195> Pat's palace is a gamer cube with a crown on top

[1:53:55] <Retinolgaming> PUNCH WAIFU
[1:53:56] <%TalisKanju> Dump Yusuke
[1:53:56] <%shaidot> ryuji is actually much better mid game for reasons
[1:53:56] <%logoth_> Ann has insane nukes
[1:53:57] <%Kmiaofficial> try telling me to go to sleep on the bench morgana
[1:53:57] <%Typhaeon> "Share button"
[1:53:59] <%SvenHolgersson> Ann suckkkkkkkkkkkkkks until later
[1:53:59] <NekoZen> makoto combines with ryuji
[1:54:02] <%Legato_Ambrose> Ann's good
[1:54:02] <%colezone_> I feel like makoto is the most busted character in this game
[1:54:03] <%Daniel_Is_I> Ryuji hits like a truck though
[1:54:05] <+Weeewer> ANN HAS TARUNDA ARE YOU HIGH??
[1:54:06] <%BoomerUnchained> Ann > Simp
[1:54:07] <+GohanHitsugaya> LUL
[1:54:09] <+Weeewer> Tarunda is fucking godlike
[1:54:11] <%valriot> Ryuji, Makoto and Kasumi is the broken team
[1:54:11] <%Scarnehu> did pat get fox geared up?
[1:54:11] <%SvenHolgersson> YOU WERE WRONG THE FIRST TIME

[1:54:17] <%SvenHolgersson> UGHHHHHHHHH
[1:54:18] <+rei0> everyone is good now, techincal damage is so busted in p5r
[1:54:18] <+abrupt_abe> Why limit when you can switch in battle?
[1:54:18] <%toolofparanoia> BUT PAT... THE BRO JOBS
[1:54:19] <zenorot> I only use Ann when she learns concentrate
[1:54:19] <%spiritofmojave> Annnnd that's a proble?
[1:54:20] <%starotter70> Use them ALL
[1:54:20] <%shaidot> ann ryuji makoto

[1:54:21] <%Joestar1890> Love them sounds effects
[1:54:22] <RogueMinja> It's a good party.
[1:54:22] <%Daniel_Is_I> @PatStaresAt Just rotate characters as they get underleveled. That's what I do.
[1:54:27] <%Klefth> Did they rebalance the party a bit in this version btw? 'cause in the original it was kinda dumb how much better Ann, Ryuji and Morgana were in combat compared to everyone else
[1:54:27] <%pectusumbra> I mean it's early, really only late game when you have all the members matters
[1:54:28] <Judeknight> You could just have the same party for a little bit and switch it up
[1:54:29] <TheDo_DoGuy> ann can lower attacks
[1:54:31] <%damienlunas> Play with whoever you want
[1:54:32] <%satans_finest_millennial> Mako is always a higher level than me.
[1:54:33] <+Flambage> @PatStaresAt Screw them all and solo the palace
[1:54:34] <%DensityD> nude lewd paintings
[1:54:35] <%zeif00> I enjoy the aesthetics of this dungeon a lot psaUp
[1:54:36] <%DensityD> plague
[1:54:37] <Cybersoul666> it's almost as if some characters are just better then others.
[1:54:37] <topendbuzza> just do what you want pat
[1:54:41] <%pectusumbra> or just give everyone a little play for C O N T E N T
[1:54:44] <%SvenHolgersson> Ryuji Makoto **** FOR LIFE

[1:54:57] <T_Sasquatch> BLESS
[1:54:58] <Bguy32> Skull,quenn and fox was the best party
[1:54:58] <%Daniel_Is_I> I always swap the highest level out for the lowest.
[1:55:04] <%Dr00_PhD> @Klefth once you get the jazz club you can give the other members some good skills to even them up
[1:55:05] <%TalisKanju> I like that Madarame has a incredibly conspicuous door that he hides his secrets in
[1:55:05] <%weissguard> BANG BANG
[1:55:05] <+Weeewer> Haru has triple riser
[1:55:06] <Yukai_Yami> Hifumi lets you switch them out mid battle so who cares?
[1:55:10] <%pectusumbra> Is Bifrons in this game?
[1:55:11] <zenorot> Plus Haru has good gun and pys skills
[1:55:12] <spacecatstreams> mm bepis

[1:55:15] <fearhurst> this'll end it
[1:55:17] <%Drizzydre116> I've never found mona to be terribly useful, he's only good for healing
[1:55:20] <waverunner56> Do you want to see the strongman?
[1:55:23] <+cherriplus> haru is the most underrated party member
[1:55:25] <%zeif00> I wish Hifumi was a phantom theif
[1:55:26] <%xcompleasedad> Personer
[1:55:27] <JonnyZeFox> origami boi THICC defenses
[1:55:30] <+Weeewer> Mona is the best healer though so he does have that going for him

[1:56:12] <%aishman> @PatStaresAt Ring of Lust, it's a real good healing/atk booster
[1:56:14] <%shaidot> He needs to go to mementos to get it

[2:13:38] <Dhurkst> @Merhabi Plagiarism is basically the theft & invalidation of your hard work & time, and the credit you would have received for it all.
[2:13:46] <ThatGuyNamedEdd> Season 1 bender

[2:14:24] <KaitlynnHere> You know what does suck? That dead artists make way more money than living ones
[2:14:29] <+knowyourenemy_97> This is new
[2:14:35] <jaygee303> Aw I hated this part in the OG
[2:14:36] <%sund0wner> @KaitlynnHere Yerp
[2:14:46] <%Typhaeon> I remember one of these tall paper guys from Monster Party for the NES
[2:14:49] <+knowyourenemy_97> I never messed up with this part
[2:14:51] <%Typhaeon> But he was uh meatier
[2:14:52] <%DensityD> pathetic
[2:14:54] <%sund0wner> Shiki-Ouji lookin' gangly
[2:14:54] <%SvenHolgersson> THIS IS HIS SHOW
[2:14:57] <%tigerfang86> SIMP CAT
[2:15:00] <%pectusumbra> Man so many good updates/releases coming in the next month
[2:15:02] <%Dr00_PhD> It's not new
[2:15:02] <%xcompleasedad> Simp level is RISING
[2:15:05] <%narusao> good boi psaElmo
[2:15:05] <%NopeBadguy> @sund0wner Well, he IS paper
[2:15:07] <%Aydarkzero> those two morgona lines sum him up perfectly
[2:15:10] <KaitlynnHere> Not saying plagiarism is ok but sometimes artists do it just to make ends meet
[2:15:10] <%SvenHolgersson> Why is Morgana even here
[2:15:11] <+palebluedots> S I M P
[2:15:13] <waverunner56> No wonder Ryuji is fed up with Morgana later
[2:15:15] <%NitronStreams> man morgana really never shuts up
[2:15:17] <+griffball13> @PatStaresAt is there a reason why only joker can have more than one persona beside game reasons?
[2:15:26] <Dhurkst> @Merhabi It's an invalidation of your passion, as well
[2:15:27] <%weissguard> Lore reasons
[2:15:28] <+rei0> it despawn until you get far
[2:15:32] <%xcompleasedad> @SvenHolgersson That's actually a good question. He shouldn't be there.
[2:15:34] <%Typhaeon> He's a very special boy
[2:15:35] <%tigerfang86> lorez
[2:15:35] <%optimasmaximas> well
[2:15:36] <%Aydarkzero> Protag powers
[2:15:37] <%pectusumbra> The Fool Arcana basically.
[2:15:38] <%DensityD> main character main character main character main character main character main character main character
[2:15:39] <%NitronStreams> chosen one
[2:15:39] <%starotter70> Protag
[2:15:40] <%optimasmaximas> plot wise kinda
[2:15:40] <%xcompleasedad> @SvenHolgersson Not even in the main party
[2:15:41] <%Spec7re> Joker is the Fool Arcana
[2:15:41] <jaygee303> @griffball13 His dong big that’s why
[2:15:42] <%Joestar1890> Berubet key
[2:15:43] <%Dragovus> WILD CARD BITCHES!
[2:15:44] <%Movemeister> Fool
[2:15:44] <+dirtyh4rr1> cuz big dick
[2:15:44] <filialpails> WILD CARD, BABY
[2:15:44] <+netrac> Favoritism
[2:15:44] <%Totally_not_toby> Yes because he's a sociopath
[2:15:46] <%sund0wner> He's the best thief
[2:15:47] <%chronoxgp> it's only plagerism if you don't give credit
[2:15:47] <%SGrim> He's the "WILD CARD" tm.
[2:15:47] <waverunner56> Aigis can have more than one persona at one point...
[2:15:49] <MSN04_Sazabi> My Persona would be a gun. I would then grab the gun and shoot Morgana with it.
[2:15:49] <%shaidot> has to do with igor's choice
[2:15:50] <+Merhabi> I've always liked Blank Slate theory
[2:15:52] <big_oki> you think Elmo is self conscious hes on stream?
[2:15:57] <WanderingSwordsman> @patstaresat its because he's a wild card user
[2:16:05] <+knowyourenemy_97> Every Persona MC has the wild card
[2:16:07] <%tigerfang86> MMMMM
[2:16:09] <topendbuzza> use 3rd eye
[2:16:20] <%NitronStreams> jokers personality is so vague he could be any persona LUL
[2:16:22] <%Typhaeon> That butan presed itself
[2:16:22] <%bevyrage> joker gets called out for having multiple personas and morgana says 'there must be more to you than meets the eye' meaning joker has 'depth' while everyone else is more shallow and therefore not as easy for the player to project upon
[2:16:24] <%Klefth> You... did it
[2:16:25] <%sund0wner> Boop
[2:16:27] <jaygee303> psaGoblin psaGoblin psaGoblin psaGoblin psaGoblin
[2:16:46] <%chronoxgp> joker is omni-present
[2:16:52] <+tonymappo> Press Square for heal menu
[2:16:53] <%sund0wner> This part's definitely annoying despite looking exceptional
[2:16:56] <%Totally_not_toby> Joker can have different personas because he's an insane sociopath who only tells people what they want to hear and not what he thinks because thinks nothing because he's an insane sociopath
[2:16:56] <%sund0wner> Tedium
[2:16:57] <%arcielardor> @patstaresat The protagonists in each person's game signs a contract in the Velvet Room. that's how they are able to use them.
[2:17:05] <%pectusumbra> octopus now?
[2:17:07] <%weissguard> Translation: Being the Player Character just makes you better than most people.
[2:17:16] <%sund0wner> @Totally_not_toby Mmmmm...
[2:17:32] <appletumtum> What does it mean for the bad guys who are given the same power tho
[2:17:35] <jaygee303> Anyone who can date and fuck 13 to 15 girls at once in the same city can have multiple personas
[2:17:41] <%tigerfang86> PAY ME
[2:17:42] <%chronoxgp> nioh
[2:17:44] <%Daniel_Is_I> It's like if Pat was an artist
[2:17:46] <%tigerfang86> Madarame is PAY ME
[2:17:48] <%UvBenServed> psaBougie psaBougie psaBougie psaBougie
[2:17:52] <%Fooguwu> heppy munney :)
[2:17:54] <%arancet> in addition to lore reasons, i took the idea of the MCs having multiple personas an allusion to the idea that theyre being controlled by the player, who could be anyone
[2:18:01] <%spiritofmojave> PAY ME is beautiful, if he's right about nothing else
[2:18:02] <%Aydarkzero> it's cool
[2:18:07] <%Typhaeon> I feel ya, sleep has been fleeting
[2:18:08] <%Engwithan_Elder_God> That's fie, I've been napping most of it.
[2:18:09] <%starotter70> Understandable
[2:18:23] <%floralkami> that's fine personally, im tired af anyway
[2:18:27] <%DensityD> I want Morgana in my animal crossing island
[2:18:29] <%Typhaeon> Any of those paintings wouldn't be out of place in mediocre hotel art
[2:18:36] <%xcompleasedad> Stranger Danger?
[2:18:46] <%tigerfang86> HUGE
[2:18:50] <%Typhaeon> Big boy damage

[2:18:52] <+Greywyn00> might LUL
[2:18:53] <%pectusumbra> I remember there being a lot of dungeon in this stil though. But you are huge
[2:18:55] <gluemanofficial> Ryuji's a beast
[2:18:57] <%starotter70> WHAT
[2:18:58] <TioXyco> how possigle?
[2:18:59] <+knowyourenemy_97> Watch how Persona 6 bring back the " tired mechanic" where every character and you get so tired or sick that you don't go to whatever you do to fight shadows...
[2:19:04] <%BubbaRands> NAH IT'S STILL CHALLENGING LUL
[2:19:07] <%SvenHolgersson> Ryuji is just A GODDDDDD
[2:19:17] <+knowyourenemy_97> just like P3
[2:19:22] <%linSP> how far did pat get in meme mentos
[2:19:36] <jaygee303> Paper boi never had a chance
[2:19:37] <%xcompleasedad> Pretty good item
[2:19:51] <%xcompleasedad> Is there a version for every level of the element?
[2:19:53] <topendbuzza> I hear seed
[2:20:02] <+dirtyh4rr1> seed nearby
[2:20:02] <%nilla_24> lasers
[2:20:03] <%xcompleasedad> Because you ignored them
[2:20:04] <+Arkfyre> you can get them later
[2:20:05] <%pectusumbra> it opened when you put in the password
[2:20:06] <RogueMinja> You could.
[2:20:06] <%Dr00_PhD> You ignored them. The door opened
[2:20:07] <%starotter70> You could
[2:20:08] <AEUG_Ace_Kamille> You didn't go the right way round.
[2:20:09] <+Greywyn00> you could when you opended the gates
[2:20:09] <gluemanofficial> Ann is right. The phantom thieves ARE so awesome
[2:20:11] <RogueMinja> It opened grates.
[2:20:14] <lordzaskez> you didn't go back
[2:20:15] <+rei0> didn't you open the shutter? i thought you took the chest
[2:20:16] <%Corporate_Redeemer> Has Pat equipped the Ring of Lust on anyone yet?
[2:20:16] <%DensityD> go romance Paige and then sex her up
[2:20:17] <topendbuzza> the door open you can
[2:20:18] <Yukai_Yami> There’s a seed close you?
[2:20:25] <+krlos970> @xcompleasedad Yep
[2:20:31] <%shaidot> he doesn't have ring of lust yet
[2:20:32] <%pariahsama> should be open now?
[2:20:32] <%xcompleasedad> @krlos970 Noice
[2:20:43] <topendbuzza> I hear seed
[2:20:56] <+griffball13> he ho
[2:20:57] <%anticrust> @PatStaresAt Did you find any seeds in this dungeon?
[2:21:01] <%Garthunox> give back, theres a grapple point up to the seed
[2:21:04] <Yukai_Yami> There’s a seed nearby
[2:21:05] <%Scarnehu> they were open you just kinda left them there
[2:21:06] <jaygee303> Does anyone know if they fixed the space palace in royal? Always remember that as the worst one
[2:21:24] <%nilla_24> it's still the worst
[2:21:29] <%shaidot> there's one right here thats tough to get
[2:21:32] <%Garthunox> @jaygee303 nope
[2:21:37] <+tonymappo> Did you ever play this game with Japanese VO?
[2:21:37] <waverunner56> It still sucks, apparently the boss is better though. About to fight him now
[2:21:38] <ultimate_joker_main> they made it a little better but they made the boss harder @jaygee303
[2:21:39] <+rei0> they made 5th dungeon bit better
[2:21:43] <%TalisKanju> Space palace isnt as bad as Government ship
[2:21:45] <+b9k9com> Hey Pat, thanks for going back and redoing the ff7r stuff. ^_^
[2:21:54] <%Garthunox> @rei0 no they didnt
[2:21:58] <topendbuzza> only bad boss is space
[2:22:03] <%DensityD> m a t t m e r c e r
[2:22:07] <%walnutcast> which palace is this? maderans or whatever?
[2:22:11] <wes_ranked> silly morgana, YOU CANT WASTE AMMO ANYMORE
[2:22:16] <jaygee303> Damn it’s the only substantially bad part of the game as well@
[2:22:26] <%Zombrocom> So Morgana is just off to the side yelling encouragement?
[2:22:38] <%chronoxgp> dorian grey
[2:22:57] <Vindicato> I loved the devil survivor series, is persona like that?
[2:23:03] <waverunner56> The whole Okumura/Pissy Morgana arc is unfortunate
[2:23:09] <%sund0wner> Madarame's
[2:23:15] <%starotter70> @Vindicato To an extent
[2:23:19] <+Greywyn00> space boss was really tough on hard when I played the base game
[2:23:28] <%sund0wner> Yoink
[2:23:30] <%pectusumbra> @Vindicato a little bit. Think of Devil Survivor as Persona X SMT but with a different type of gameplay
[2:23:31] <+dirtyh4rr1> how does he know about the seeds though?
[2:23:38] <%sund0wner> Yusuke knows all
[2:23:47] <Vindicato> @starotter70 From what I've seen so far it is mostly the same universe but different styles and no choice and consequence?
[2:23:49] <zenorot> is Atlus incapable of producing games in this generation
[2:23:52] <%GohanHitsugaya> He horny for treasure
[2:23:53] <%sund0wner> Joker the TREASURE GET IT GO GET IT NOW

[2:50:46] <ashinmyfac> What kind o beer u drink?
[2:50:56] <%valriot> Cos the anime looks like shit LUL
[2:50:57] <%cvp5127> @BallerSwagBro9k cause its bad
[2:51:10] <%Dr00_PhD> @BallerSwagBro9k they rushed through the story and it looks like shit
[2:51:13] <gluemanofficial> The anime is shit because it doesnt go for harem ending
[2:51:13] <%Spec7re> @BallerSwagBro9k Its really bad
[2:51:14] <+j_mac2> yea it sucks
[2:51:16] <topendbuzza> it bad
[2:51:19] <+knowyourenemy_97> I heard that they cut some stuff off from the game and the animation is bad.
[2:51:19] <%ape_hawk> the p4 anime was good
[2:51:21] <3Xgilly> Its really rough...
[2:51:23] <%spiritofmojave> it's hefty garbage
[2:51:24] <%tigerfang86> TINY BOSS
[2:51:24] <%ape_hawk> not the golden one
[2:51:26] <+SpicyCheeseNips> THIS GUY SUCKS
[2:51:26] <%GabeSweetMan> The one saving grace is the CANON choices Joker makes.
[2:51:26] <%shaidot> its tough
[2:51:27] <%chronoxgp> p4 anime was made by Studio IG LUL
[2:51:27] <Scotaku> The art for the anime is so jank.
[2:51:28] <%Zebroneath> ANime is really bad
[2:51:28] <%Ynkubus18> The p5 anime is just a meh summary
[2:51:29] <CanadianAnimatorGuy> It's the studio that did the P4G anime
[2:51:30] <%Laecerelius> Piss baby boss!
[2:51:31] <%Legato_Ambrose> awh really? I was lookin forward to watching it after I finish the game
[2:51:32] <%JohnAtDawn> Yeah They need a Golden version of the P5 anime
[2:51:32] <%tigerfang86> ITS THAT GUY
[2:51:34] <+abrupt_abe> P4 anime is funny and enjoyable, P5 is not
[2:51:34] <+knowyourenemy_97> Both P4 animes were good
[2:51:36] <+dirtyh4rr1> a pokeman
[2:51:36] <redrins> arahabaki
[2:51:37] <%heartlesshealer> yeah
[2:51:37] <+rei0> arahabaki
[2:51:37] <%Dr00_PhD> aharabaki
[2:51:38] <ProximityAlert> Anime was pretty bad, but all of the new music that came out of it was WORTH IT
[2:51:39] <RogueMinja> Arahabaki.
[2:51:39] <%ape_hawk> Asshole
[2:51:40] <+j_mac2> P4 was actually good
[2:51:40] <+Pixel_Matt> P5 ANIME AKA WHAT IS PACING?
[2:51:42] <topendbuzza> love this guy
[2:51:42] <%valriot> Look at the animes first All Out Attack, its atrocious
[2:51:44] <+SpicyCheeseNips> USE STATUS MOVES PAT
[2:51:44] <appletumtum> Its a Dogu?
[2:51:44] <%starotter70> The only good thing about the anime was the OP
[2:51:46] <%floralkami> @ballerswagbro9k subpar VA direction and lackluster presentation. they even managed to water down the AllOut attack enders
[2:51:48] <Scotaku> P5 anime does all-out attack screens but they all look like shit.
[2:51:50] <%arcielardor> reflects all magic
[2:51:50] <%weissguard> Arahabaki
[2:51:52] <gluemanofficial> The P4 anime is good except it made a lot of people dislike Marie unfairly
[2:51:52] <%BallerSwagBro9k> psaCrazyhand psaCrazyhead psaCrazy

[2:51:57] <astrofalcon1> come on joker BabyRage
[2:51:58] <%zeif00> There was a 1 episode OVA that was good that came out before the anime
[2:51:59] <%heartlesshealer> uhh
[2:52:02] <%GabeSweetMan> P4 anime was higher quality than I was expecting. P5 was lower than expected.
[2:52:03] <%Dr00_PhD> the new music is pretty great though
[2:52:03] <%heartlesshealer> heal Joker at least
[2:52:09] <%weissguard> AKA Reflect GOD
[2:52:16] <+netrac> P5 Daybreakers was ok
[2:52:17] <%bread_assassin> Say what you want about the P5 anime, but the 2nd OP and the Valantines OVA were fuckin LIT.
[2:52:18] <zarbudda77> my older brother and me just said that
[2:52:19] <Kuj999> That thing shouldn’t appear until that guys’s place.

[2:55:33] <RogueMinja> It's pretty good.
[2:55:33] <%FlakkLIVE> Ironic that the sponsored VOD is gone and the DONT STREAM T HIS game is going strong
[2:55:34] <%starotter70> Yeah
[2:55:35] <%valriot> LUL

[2:55:38] <+Galactic0ne> LUL
[2:55:40] <+dirtyh4rr1> yeah, you want that
[2:55:40] <topendbuzza> yep

[2:55:43] <%Dr00_PhD> It gets even better later
[2:55:43] <Mattais88> second dungeon
[2:55:46] <Yukai_Yami> Wow that’s goooooood
[2:55:46] <%JohnAtDawn> Does that cancel Shadow Madarama's move?
[2:55:47] <+rei0> yeah
[2:55:49] <waverunner56> I haven't taken it off since I got it
[2:55:49] <+dirtyh4rr1> be vain
[2:55:54] <+abrupt_abe> @patstaresat upgraded form is even better
[2:55:55] <+Merhabi> check status?
[2:55:59] <%ape_hawk> guys, the VOD is still there, just still fucked up
[2:56:00] <+j_mac2> fuck what's it do?
[2:56:00] <%heartlesshealer> Slime is now viable for endgame!
[2:56:05] <%Dragovus> Mona and Panther heal
[2:56:06] <%SvenHolgersson> Sidhe?
[2:56:09] <%SvenHolgersson> I forget
[2:56:10] <redrins> kushinada Kappa
[2:56:10] <Meekest> Pat I'll be honest I dont know
[2:56:11] <%foley0331> Cybele.
[2:56:11] <Eger007> nulifies what?
[2:56:12] <%psydaku> just use Mona
[2:56:13] <%shaidot> isis?
[2:56:14] <%Laecerelius> Healey jokesona
[2:56:16] <Aoworth> @spiritofmojave Yeah seemed that way to me to too idk.
[2:56:18] <+D00msDayDan> harley quinn
[2:56:20] <%valriot> Early game? Not many.
[2:56:21] <+Merhabi> Apsaras?
[2:56:21] <%Dr00_PhD> You have that media skill card @PatStaresAt
[2:56:21] <%SvenHolgersson> Mona sux
[2:56:23] <%JohnAtDawn> I mean I don't know how you made Lean Sidhe WITHOUT healing...
[2:56:24] <$PaleBloodInk> Yeah, that's pretty much the only accessory I used for 95% of the game.
[2:56:25] <+rei0> mona is the healer of the game tho
[2:56:34] <+orion_248> Kaguyama? I think it's a DLC persona though.
[2:56:43] <%heartlesshealer> You used a Black Ooze is how
[2:56:44] <gluemanofficial> Mona is a good healer but he has less health than Yukkiko
[2:56:46] <%spiritofmojave> @aoworth mhm, though yeah who can say idk if they still take down stuff
[2:56:50] <%weissguard> Principality is also Justice Arcana.
[2:56:50] <%bread_assassin> Mona gets Lucky Punch, so he's pretty good in my book.
[2:56:50] <%pectusumbra> Lee-ann Sheee
[2:56:51] <%Drizzydre116> Who need heals when you can just deal more damage
[2:56:54] <%ape_hawk> nice
[2:56:55] <%Dragovus> @PatStaresAt use Mona to heal between fights I mean what else is he doing with his SP?
[2:56:56] <RogueMinja> Makoto? She heals.
[2:57:07] <+Merhabi> but we dont have makoto
[2:57:08] <%SvenHolgersson> killllllllllll
[2:57:13] <marvinbrewton25> LOL
[2:57:15] <Aoworth> I thought Pat's stream was sponsored too so I wouldn't think Squeenix would be fucking with it
[2:57:17] <+Untitledproject> yo pat you gonna do strive beta?
[2:57:18] <+netrac> Makoto is a better healear cuss Mediaraham is enough
[2:57:20] <%frunkAF> Pat, make him run his pockets!
[2:57:20] <%Zombrocom> Aww poor demon monkey monster
[2:57:22] <%Spec7re> NO MERCY
[2:57:22] <+orion_248> My bad, the persona I meant to refer to was Kaguya Hime
[2:57:23] <%JumbleJams> aww nut Nue's cute
[2:57:27] <%reonome> THE VOD IS STILL THERE GUYS
[2:57:29] <topendbuzza> nah just twitch
[2:57:30] <%JohnAtDawn> I actually had a pretty good Nue for most of my playthrough
[2:57:30] <%heartlesshealer> It was sponsored
[2:57:33] <%valriot> The best healer is honestly Joker lmao
[2:57:34] <marvinbrewton25> demon: wait pat:fk you!
[2:57:40] <%warmnoid> cap em
[2:57:40] <%ape_hawk> snuff film?
[2:57:41] <MonsieurHonHon> using mona in combat is double bad because you dont get the in between combat heals and because Mona gets screentime
[2:57:49] <MonsieurHonHon> which is the biggest problem of the two
[2:57:49] <+TechnicolorNinja> "Spare my life!" stripYan "No."
[2:57:50] <gluemanofficial> Pats FFVII stream removed because the subreddit was saying mean things about the game
[2:58:01] <%Valdorick> Twitch fucked up bad yesterday, its not Square killing a #Sponsered stream
[2:58:07] <%Dr00_PhD> Definitely screen time
[2:58:08] <Aoworth> Ah
[2:58:08] <%nictron90> Nigi Mitama learns media and is around level 20 so should be a decent one
[2:58:10] <+yolothewizard> Sidhe is just pronounced “she”
[2:58:14] <%GarbageNirvana> psaSmug Does this look like the face of mercy
[2:58:15] <%ape_hawk> hey pat, you gonna try out the Wastelanders update for FO76???
[2:58:25] <%SvenHolgersson> hahhahahaahhaahahahhaaha
[2:58:28] <%ape_hawk> j/k, its still garbage
[2:58:28] <Aoworth> DIE
[2:58:32] <+Merhabi> I think Twitch had a big redundancy issue where there just wasnt any
[2:58:37] <Aoworth> Calm down Yusuke damn
[2:58:40] <+Pixel_Matt> SourPls
[2:58:40] <%SvenHolgersson> He should and get it sponsored
[2:58:44] <Meekest> Huh theres a lot of heal spells on Mona
[2:58:49] <BluBox> Child

[2:59:31] <+Merhabi> Fallout 76 good?
[2:59:33] <%Spec7re> Fallout 76 is still a massive trash fire
[2:59:33] <%GarbageNirvana> Someone on the discord went in on Fallout First
[2:59:33] <+knowyourenemy_97> Not worth the money
[2:59:34] <+Remery_> They finally finished the game?
[2:59:34] <T_Sasquatch> Fuck yeaaaaa 76 time Kappa
[2:59:35] <%SvenHolgersson> IT WOULD BE FUNNY
[2:59:41] <%warmnoid> from dogshit to mediocrity
[2:59:41] <%PrimordialDonut> if no mans sky was able to get fixed, any game can
[2:59:41] <%Corporate_Redeemer> It's..........okay now

[3:00:11] <astrofalcon1> can't believe fallout 76 is the best game of the 2020s
