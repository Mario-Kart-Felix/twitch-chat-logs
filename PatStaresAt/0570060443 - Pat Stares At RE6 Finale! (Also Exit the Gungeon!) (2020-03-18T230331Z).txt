[0:23:22] <%SoFarFetched> Cheer500 I get that mucus feeling whenever I wake up too early at times. I think it depends on what you ate/drank before you went to bed and what time. Sucks for me because my hunger schedule is different everyday. I'm either not as hungry or super hungry,so my meals go from 1-4 at times. I would use Mucinex at times if I don't feel like coughing up a lung for it. But now I have to use it before I go out,so people don't think I'm carrying the Corona.

[0:39:22] <%biomegabear> @tusk102 Only thing I enjoy about bleach is any kenpachi fight
[0:39:22] <%MaddyCaddy> Why would you ever need to be a cyborg if you're not a cop/soldier?
[0:39:26] <%honeyman18> This is like the last spoonful of poop from a bowl of shit, bit late to care now

[0:41:49] <RubberFistFight> YES I HAVE A BIG TIP. Look up the cheese tactic, because you're better off trying multiple attempts at that than actually directly fighting him, because that fight is FUCKING. AWFUL.

[0:42:55] <RubberFistFight> By doing a bunch of tricky jumps and exploiting the geometry you can convince him to just throw himself off the cliff and you win without fighting him directly. It's way better than doing it legit.

[1:04:57] <DadStopPls> A trap that kills the guard
[1:04:57] <%BTRNDL> this is some dumb bullshit
[1:04:57] <%t2381> Even umbrella had better security.

[1:39:00] <+jiggy_snipe> we're going to secret ancient American catacombs
[1:39:01] <RubberFistFight> @FreeFuzeIcedTea because they like it and they can't be objective. I had a guy in my stream yesterday who was a big fan of SotC - here's me struggling with the ropey jumping, the floaty movements and the absolutely broken-ass physics and getting real tilted, and I apologised for shitting on a game he loves - he just said "it's ok - the game has real issues but I get kinda blind to them because of how much I love it." I was like... wow, that's a level of honesty most people struggle to reach.

[1:39:17] <TafferAA> good thing leon didn't take the puzzle pieces with him

[1:39:43] <+spodebroker> I've been bombarding my friends with Discord msgs about older RE games because I'm trying desperately to distract myself from this shitshow.

[1:40:12] <ape_hawk> has the evil been defeated yet?
[1:40:14] <rhodescar> at home with a cold, but at least I get to watch a stream live for once
[1:40:14] <KaiserMario> Does it really matter why?
[1:40:14] <$Sphincter_Spelunker> "I like that it's like an action movie. It's whiny people that it's not like their past Resident Evils that I laugh at." That's one I saw
[1:40:15] <shinelucid> y NotLikeThis
[1:40:15] <King_Wolf_Rigger> @thegreenbenis Hi SO FUCKING BORED, I'm dad.
[1:40:16] <+kapcommunist> this is baaaad
[1:40:17] <JonEWorldbeater> SHUT UP
[1:40:17] <Mexrage> the graveyard is haunted, and the ghost got a crush on Ada, that's the only explanation
[1:40:19] <tusk102> @PatStaresAt now play all these games again for re8 release
[1:40:19] <DHBoi> Is this the Dumbest it has ever been?
[1:40:20] <+lethallylactic> It is totally fair
[1:40:20] <%psychodave1234> NO ITS GARBAGE ALWAYS
[1:40:23] <AdmiralButtloaf> @PatStaresAt game tells you to fuck off but try again tho
[1:40:25] <%jiin6> Pat you already know
[1:40:27] <CloniiCory> Pat I know you want to speedrun through this shit as much as possible, but it's unavoidable.
[1:40:27] <RunningNGunning> TIME FOR THE SINGLE WORST ROOM IN THE GAME
[1:40:28] <%thegreenbenis> @King_Wolf_Rigger Hey dad.
[1:40:28] <missingangle> No it's still dumb
[1:40:33] <+ArtoriasTheTrenchfighter> Fuck being fair, this is dumb
[1:40:33] <krow021> So is Ada just constantly talking to herself
[1:40:36] <evbites> remember in four when she just used a grappling hook to smash into windows
[1:40:38] <%SirGO0SE> do it with her big buuutttttt
[1:40:38] <%derekwst3> @PatStaresAt you asked for puzzles, you have puzzels
[1:40:38] <%Binary_Fireball> @PatStaresAt would you rather play this or omnikron?
[1:40:40] <+spodebroker> The difference is that when RE4 does dumb bullshit for no reason, it's FUN bullshit
[1:40:41] <%optimasmaximas> RE4 ROOM
[1:40:42] <ThatGuyThere03> WHY WAS THERE A LOCK THERE
[1:40:42] <boogaleeboo> This isn't an RE game, it's a 3rd person shooter, you go from objective to objective.
[1:40:44] <ZeeR01> Those are what we call bad video games Pat
[1:40:44] <%xxshadowxx416> this worse one of the 4 campaigns
[1:40:47] <SMuffinMan> At least the series is all uphill from here legit
[1:40:48] <shinelucid> hey this is re4ish
[1:40:49] <Dragon_Batman> It's fair, but considering the whole game is like it, I don't see a point in constantly doing it
[1:40:49] <King_Wolf_Rigger> @thegreenbenis I'm still out for cigarettes. Need anything?
[1:40:51] <%optimasmaximas> LITERAL COPY PASTE RE4 ROOM
[1:40:51] <%thegreenbenis> Omnikron is interestingly shitty.
[1:40:52] <Darkfire346> Ada is the coolest person in Adas mind. And Leons.

[1:41:29] <+spodebroker> She reminds me of the Arkham City Catwoman model
[1:41:30] <RubberFistFight> @PatStaresAt some points deserved to be belaboured though. There's a point where you can't allow a game any more conceits than it's already got, because it's already relying on too many to function.
[1:41:31] <%ForlornCarton> yup, nothing zombies like more than flipping switches
[1:41:31] <Masamune84> So that is what happened Billy Coen
[1:41:32] <rubbishbinge> figure out the puzzle

[1:58:26] <%mckraven> @Nobrev A game shouldn't be able to hit you in a cutscene

[1:59:53] <boogaleeboo> It's like in 0 he said it was bad, but he still managed all the item management because he was engaged
[1:59:54] <%Conyst> If this didn't have Resident Evil in the name it would have been sold by game makers such as digital homicide
[1:59:54] <$Dakuu75> @tusk102 nope. might be twitch glitching for you. try refreshing your browser
[1:59:55] <%honeyman18> Honeslty limping to the finish line here is appropriate
[1:59:57] <%derekwst3> if you were in the RE world, how would you like to die?

[2:05:33] <+hawk_rush> yep
[2:05:34] <+HeavyMetalIceCream> read my mind
[2:05:35] <%TheMattman1313> Yeah but when would Ada EVER admit that?
[2:05:35] <%KishinGrek> I hope the cart glitch happens again
[2:05:35] <%Zaphire_Saucypants> no, she's got to be MYSTERIOUS
[2:05:36] <jjetfuel> ada === hot
[2:05:37] <KatabolicRage> Ada lives for coming off as mysterious
[2:05:37] <TioXyco> rather "I don't care"
[2:05:38] <+Zeromaru2> It would, but why would she ever admit that
[2:05:38] <boogaleeboo> "Simmons is a weird pervert, lul"
[2:05:39] <TalisKanju> Why does Ada show up here? What is the purpose?!
[2:05:40] <Plague_bagel> actually no time
[2:05:40] <%Taisuru> She's too cool to not know
[2:05:41] <%Frost_Quill> "It's complicated." meaning "I don't FUCKING KNOW."
[2:05:42] <%spiritofmojave> EW
[2:05:42] <+ArtoriasTheTrenchfighter> No I've got to be MYSTERIOUS
[2:05:42] <ImmaCanuck> Yuck.
[2:05:42] <+lethallylactic> Kreygasm
[2:05:43] <ape_hawk> yeah but ada would never admit that
[2:05:43] <tusk102> @PatStaresAt "simmons is framing me and said he was"

[2:05:51] <qu3kl41n_the_impure_king> yay!
[2:05:51] <stranger59> Ada can't admit weakness.
[2:05:53] <%Frost_Quill> She has to seem mysterious.
[2:05:53] <trianglehat> lewd
[2:05:53] <%Laecerelius> amazing boss time
[2:05:53] <%medusasghost> big dumb
[2:05:54] <%michingmallecho> THERES NO TIME
[2:05:55] <tyrano_the_wise> I would stick my dick into that coronavirus
[2:05:55] <Ipsenscastle> Don't shoot this disgusting killer monster
[2:05:55] <$floralkami> imma be real, this game is making me HATE Ada as a character in the RE franchise, and it sucks
[2:05:56] <%Zaphire_Saucypants> Mystery Titties, back in action.
[2:05:56] <$joylent_blue> DON'T SHOOT YOU SAY?
[2:05:56] <evbites> she should have died super hard
[2:05:56] <%Dhurkst> HELENA IS THE SIMP HERE
[2:05:57] <%patriotrenegade> UNBLOCKABLE ON WAKE UO
[2:05:59] <%xcompleasedad> 2
[2:05:59] <CloniiCory> Ada is so onto playing mysterious she can't turn it off anymore.
[2:05:59] <%lethallunacyx> When will this nightmare end amiright?
[2:06:01] <+hawk_rush> damn, helena's dead
[2:06:02] <1matheuw> just leave her to die
[2:06:03] <+KENTASHIRO> I'm getting a real EDF vibe right now for some reason
[2:06:03] <+Taisuru> YOU DID IT
[2:06:03] <tusk102> nice shot pat
[2:06:04] <%derap41> No nipple boobies
[2:06:04] <%goose_attack_almanac> God why did they make Deborah's chest bounce all over the place
[2:06:06] <boogaleeboo> You have like 16 grenades, just spend them
[2:06:06] <natebud> little push
[2:06:08] <FloresIsDead> JUST TALK TO THE MONSTER
[2:06:09] <+Grayhammatter> you.... did it
[2:06:09] <Nina96> does he have enough ammo?
[2:06:11] <jacknerik> So Ada's campain just doesn't have co-op, right?
[2:06:11] <rubbishbinge> excellent start
[2:06:12] <chowdah101> why is the zombie moaning seductively
[2:06:14] <feralady> but pat aren't you having so much fun
[2:06:15] <DuoScratch> it WORKED!
[2:06:17] <%Laecerelius> The virus removes nipples
[2:06:18] <+lethallylactic> Slimey mutant tiddies
[2:06:21] <%michingmallecho> How many times do WE HAVE TO TEACH YOU THIS LESSON OLD MONSTER
[2:06:21] <Darkfire346> I like how shes basically naked but has no nipples or vagoo....
[2:06:22] <stranger59> @goose_attack_almanac You know why.
[2:06:22] <%SirGO0SE> if you invert your nipples, you get power
[2:06:23] <heybenice> Bio mass where
[2:06:24] <%mckraven> Why is RE6 the most horny of the RE games?
[2:06:25] <primarch_lupercal> that didnt seem like that was supposed to happen
[2:06:26] <Nekros4442> Oh right
[2:06:27] <+Grayhammatter> deburah
[2:06:29] <Nekros4442> This is America isnt it
[2:06:29] <sendart> blighttown?
[2:06:30] <CloniiCory> This game is ridiculously horny looking back on it. I'm remembering why 16 year old me liked it.
[2:06:31] <Monkeyweed21> Is Helena syupid
[2:06:31] <%Shadicara> Bio whore
[2:06:34] <tusk102> @PatStaresAt the actual answer is "simmons is framing me and told me himself"
[2:06:34] <evbites> helena shut up shes dead
[2:06:34] <+jiggy_snipe> wait how did she get here so fast?
[2:06:35] <Deadman_Reborn> if you kill it it wins
[2:06:36] <%ryome> Why zombie got tibby tho
[2:06:38] <KatabolicRage> I missed the previous streams so I gotta ask if she's serious about thinking the obvious monstar is deborah
[2:06:40] <%arcaderabbit48> The problem is that we later establish that this Virus is the one virus where it is apparently possible to retain your sense of self? But like only sometimes???
[2:06:40] <%lethallunacyx> bio tiddy
[2:06:42] <tyrano_the_wise> conservation of mass means nothing on the RE universe
[2:06:42] <%xcompleasedad> HOW DO THOSE HAVE BULLETS?????
[2:06:42] <%Shady_Squid> RE6 is NOT the most horny RE game
[2:06:42] <%StaceMcGate> The ancient American Catacombs

[2:06:57] <Hellarussian> hes so cool omagaw
[2:06:57] <%goose_attack_almanac> The Resident Evil universe is so far removed from sex, that all viruses remove genitalia from the infected.
[2:06:58] <BeefyQueefer> oh
[2:06:59] <%YakumoYomi> @Darkfire346 Just dig into the slime. They're there.

[2:07:04] <tyrano_the_wise> HOW DOES SHE KNOW?
[2:07:04] <EuropanLamprey> Isn't this the place that's 1000 feet below the surface but also above the surface?
[2:07:04] <%SirGO0SE> sipsipGasm
[2:07:04] <KoopySandwichInc> how does she know leon will need the ring later tho
[2:07:09] <tyrano_the_wise> SHE JUST PICK IT

[2:07:09] <KaseKaizer> ADA WAIT
[2:07:09] <RunningNGunning> HOW DOES SHE KNOW HES GONNA NEED THAT
[2:07:10] <%SilverDevilfish> Ada has the script
[2:07:13] <+jiggy_snipe> she was proposing Kappa
[2:07:14] <%derap41> @goose_attack_almanac and nipples
[2:07:16] <%Frost_Quill> Why do you think that Ada?
[2:07:18] <+lethallylactic> IS THAT THE SCRIPT?
[2:07:20] <stranger59> Is Ada psychic?
[2:07:22] <%StaceMcGate> the 700 meter deep American Catacombs
[2:07:22] <%MonsieurHedge> matthew mercer wanted to play Leon for YEARS and when he finally got his chance it was RE6. i feel awful for the poor man
[2:07:23] <Sapphire_Breeze> @RunningNGunning she was reading the script
[2:07:26] <%Taisuru> ADA DID YOU READ THE SCRIPT
[2:07:26] <tusk102> @PatStaresAt she literally picked it up and said "idk what this is" earlier
[2:07:27] <%ryome> It’s a cock ring
[2:07:27] <TalisKanju> Ancient American catacombs with ancient American ceramics
[2:07:28] <Ipsenscastle> Boobies without nipples are so disappointing
[2:07:28] <$floralkami> WHAT IDEA ADA? WHAT IDEA COULD LEON POSSIBLY HAVE OTHER THAN,*
[2:07:29] <$lotharrio> She needs him to wear it, just not on his finger.
[2:07:30] <Deadman_Reborn> Ada has Deadpool powers
[2:07:30] <%Frost_Quill> Ada's playthrough is revealing she just makes shit up.

[2:07:37] <Darkfire346> @YakumoYomi oh, I know. Rule34 has never been more relevant than in this game
[2:07:37] <%arcaderabbit48> Seeing things from Ada's perspective really just makes Ada come across as an asshole. She has no idea what she's doing, but fuck if she'll let Leon know that!
[2:07:40] <%Laecerelius> RUB THEM TITTIES GURL
[2:07:42] <Monkeyweed21> Has Ada been bluffing the entire series and is actually super confused?

[2:08:29] <Nupinoop296> fambliy
[2:08:29] <Divantae> family family family family
[2:08:30] <+hawk_rush> fambly
[2:08:31] <CobaltPhoenix27> family family family
[2:08:31] <Freakin_Osvaldo> Shoot her big butt!
[2:08:35] <%Laecerelius> He's the ammo zombie
[2:08:36] <Dr_Mooose> he just chillin
[2:08:36] <Dragon_Batman> The plot armour helps
[2:08:36] <Darkfire346> Her and Barry are all I can think of
[2:08:37] <$rooooooooooot> yes
[2:08:38] <%KishinGrek> Muh family family family
[2:08:40] <%Jekado> Jekado subscribed at Tier 1. They've subscribed for 5 months! Hey Pat and Paige, Some cat facts since, Elmo, When people hear Elmo in the background and thought it was a baby it's because cats have learned to mimic the noises babies make since they know humans respond to that cry and pay attention to them.
[2:08:40] <$joylent_blue> it kinda ruins Helena tbh
[2:08:41] <%YakumoYomi> Fambly...fambly...fambly...
[2:08:41] <+Mumbles519> he's there to drop ammo
[2:08:41] <TalisKanju> I think, therefore the game puts me on the lower level.
[2:08:41] <tusk102> @PatStaresAt WRONG! Barry in rev2
[2:08:42] <%goose_attack_almanac> Why does she slide around and moan and cat roar
[2:08:44] <A_Classy_Gentleman> This looks like a default unity run cycle.
[2:08:44] <%arcaderabbit48> @floralkami Yet another thing RE4 does better! Granted Ada can teleport through time in that game, but I'd rather have that than "I dunno lawl"
[2:08:47] <+Grayhammatter> my FAMBLY(fambly)((fambly))
[2:08:47] <ajgilmore1> zombie is like heeyyy guyyyys
[2:08:47] <natebud> She's doing eddy gordo moves
[2:08:47] <stranger59> Helena deserved to die the most
[2:08:47] <tyrano_the_wise> where does those massive legs come from?
[2:08:48] <boogaleeboo> Helena legit should go to jail, but they just wave hands and she keeps her job
[2:08:49] <%goose_attack_almanac> nice
[2:08:50] <Mexrage> i think those zombies are just there to give you ammo
[2:08:50] <rosemon5001> ammo zombie
[2:08:51] <smig> Helena sucks
[2:08:51] <$floralkami> WHY WAS THAT SO BIG?
[2:08:53] <%thegreenbenis> Just grenade her dummy thicc moster ass.
[2:08:54] <%peachy996> look at all these losers stumble around
[2:08:56] <Famonk> what a game, what a life
[2:08:57] <+terlerkun> she would be dead if she wasn't playable lmfao
[2:08:58] <%thegreenbenis> monster*
[2:09:01] <%Meekest> Hello???
[2:09:01] <Dragon_Batman> Yea he is trying to save his daughter
[2:09:02] <%biomegabear> MOIRA
[2:09:03] <%Meekest> Pat that was half the game
[2:09:04] <tusk102> @PatStaresAt his whole thing is him trying to save his daughter
[2:09:05] <SchroedingersFerret> Where does she keep her tentacles
[2:09:06] <+xGreenflame> That's because Helena has a fate worse than death she's in this game
[2:09:07] <Darkfire346> the guy from RE2 Remake ghost survivors bit it HARD
[2:09:08] <black_pariah> more in re1
[2:09:08] <Hellarussian> angry lady, she jump
[2:09:09] <Deadman_Reborn> psaMenace
[2:09:09] <Divantae> the whole RE7
[2:09:10] <natebud> And every time Deborah just lightly pushes Helena away.
[2:09:10] <%TheMattman1313> But Barry is this playable character so he's fine
[2:09:11] <%NopeBadguy> in his defense, moira CAN die
[2:09:16] <%MalekDracarus> Something for Ada to shoot while Leon kills this boss
[2:09:17] <marvel877> Usually its giant tendrils going into a woman, not coming out of...
[2:09:19] <+Justlaxy> can I just say chris and jill have s just that.
[2:09:20] <%biomegabear> HOW LONG AGO WAS TEH REV2 LP?
[2:09:22] <tolloponik> Clair RE2
[2:09:26] <%derap41> Don't you love it how men become eye monsters but women become naked and Oily
[2:09:26] <%weissguard> Barry in Rev 2 does go to the island to save his daughter.
[2:09:26] <natebud> Man, Ethan was asking for it
[2:09:29] <tusk102> @TheMattman1313 moira is playable by coop partner also tho
[2:09:32] <%weissguard> And succeeds.
[2:09:33] <CloniiCory> The idea of Helena is fine. And she's super hot. But she's written fucking terribly.
[2:09:37] <medril07> ada has no emotional investment in this fight
[2:09:38] <iosephe> why not
[2:09:39] <Deadman_Reborn> psaMenace psaMenace
[2:09:40] <wrydiculous> Ammo bags
[2:09:40] <ImmaCanuck> Devs too horny to make a good game.
[2:09:40] <ape_hawk> because RE
[2:09:41] <%peachy996> Rev2 LP was 5 years ago I think?
[2:09:42] <%Shadicara> Ammo
[2:09:43] <King_Wolf_Rigger> The zombies are there for ammo
[2:09:43] <+NitronStreams> ammo?
[2:09:46] <CloniiCory> To drop ammo pat.
[2:09:47] <rosemon5001> ammo zombies pat thats why ammo
[2:09:47] <%Typhaeon> Helena's got man face
[2:09:47] <%TheMattman1313> @tusk102 So double plot armor?
[2:09:48] <%Taisuru> You have to beat Kerrigan Pat
[2:09:49] <black_pariah> to drop ammo why else
[2:09:50] <$joylent_blue> yeah when are we gonna get a hot dude zombie boss
[2:09:52] <tusk102> @TheMattman1313 i meant helena also
[2:09:53] <tyrano_the_wise> Ethan does save Mia
[2:09:53] <%YakumoYomi> Zombies for ammo
[2:09:54] <%biomegabear> ADA EXCLUSIVE?
[2:09:55] <$floralkami> probably forgot cause it was relevant to the story and not completely jarring as a situation
[2:09:56] <trianglehat> ammo zombies
[2:09:56] <studleydoorite> those zombies are someones sister, too!
[2:09:57] <%Shadicara> Just throw a grenade at her god
[2:09:58] <%peachy996> It was during the year of Ride to Hell
[2:09:58] <%Laecerelius> yeah they're ammo zombies
[2:10:01] <%Frost_Quill> She IS basically just Kerrigen huh.
[2:10:02] <Ipsenscastle> @derap41 extra disappointing because there's so many interesting new places for eyes to come out of
[2:10:03] <EuropanLamprey> Because there's a sexy naked zombie chick here and they want some
[2:10:03] <King_Wolf_Rigger> God I do love the tic-tac thing though.
[2:10:07] <smig> Deborah was my old sister yah know?
[2:10:09] <wrydiculous> Convenient store zombies
[2:10:09] <tusk102> @TheMattman1313 so both have plot armor. Though actually know bc one rev2 ending has moira fucking explode
[2:10:10] <%arcaderabbit48> Helena is one of those characters that I only like because of the person voicing them. She has nothing going on other than Laura Bailey
[2:10:10] <Asuxley> the ancient catacomb americans zombies
[2:10:13] <+AlastorSlain> this a poor mans Alexia
[2:10:14] <$rooooooooooot> shes doin spinneroonies and shit
[2:10:18] <Divantae> it's honestly shocking that Mia doesn't die considering wives in horror games going missing
[2:10:24] <krow021> Pat asks why there are zombies in his Resident Evil game
[2:10:29] <$floralkami> Helena, all I'm saying is All Zombies Matter.
[2:10:30] <TalisKanju> It's not even good Laura Bailey
[2:10:33] <+jiggy_snipe> why Deborah doing spin kicks and shit?
[2:10:37] <CloniiCory> They do.
[2:10:37] <rageknightlive> hit em with the old wind 'em up
[2:10:37] <%derap41> @Ipsenscastle Yeah Like the Navel or Butt Dimple
[2:10:39] <%Frost_Quill> So is Deborah doing this on purpose? Is she acting sexy on purpose for no reason?
[2:10:40] <BreakersAweigh> lmao pat doesn't even sound like he's having a bit of fun
[2:10:40] <natebud> because it doesn't make sense for there to be ammo on the ground in this cave, it only makes sense if it's dropped by ancient viking zombies
[2:10:40] <RunningNGunning> What is this music
[2:10:41] <+chimaera24> Why is she doing RE5 Jill flips
[2:10:41] <snekUrgentPls> prolly not
[2:10:42] <primarch_lupercal> god even the music is just boring
[2:10:47] <Ipsenscastle> @derap41 exactly
[2:10:50] <tusk102> @TheMattman1313 moira fucking dies in one of the two endings so helena has actually stronger plot armor somehow
[2:10:56] <%thegreenbenis> Damn them some slimey titties.
[2:10:57] <trianglehat> no my weakpoint :( that was my only weakness
[2:11:00] <evbites> where are her arms coming from
[2:11:06] <boomstickery> did you jsut skip a cut scene?
[2:11:06] <%peachy996> time for minecart soon?
[2:11:12] <%arcaderabbit48> Piers dies, but fuck him I guess!
[2:11:17] <%Zaphire_Saucypants> ye
[2:11:18] <+jiggy_snipe> maybe Helena will eat shit again
[2:11:20] <CloniiCory> Oh boy the two hottest RE6 girls.
[2:11:20] <VHLW> conveniently placed ammo pots
[2:11:20] <TalisKanju> She's probably doing Jill flips because they had the animations back from RE5
[2:11:21] <King_Wolf_Rigger> @Frost_Quill Since SEX isn't a thing in the RE universe, now that she's infected she's been awakened to a whole new thing.
[2:11:21] <%Zaphire_Saucypants> ye it is
[2:11:24] <qu3kl41n_the_impure_king> heck yea Rev2
[2:11:28] <%spiritofmojave> that'll be a fun ass stream
[2:11:29] <jjetfuel> rev2 is aight
[2:11:30] <tiaramaki> Wow, the music was so wonky that I thought the stream was lagging for me
[2:11:30] <Reanimator83> Those are the Viking zombies that built the catacombs Pat. And I thought you knew your RE6 lore
[2:11:31] <%Shadicara> From team sex to team SLOOT
[2:11:32] <stranger59> I would love if Helena ate shit for old times sake
[2:11:32] <%Dhurkst> It's good, indeed SeemsGood
[2:11:33] <SMuffinMan> All uphill from here
[2:11:33] <tiaramaki> NotLikeThis
[2:11:35] <+Grayhammatter> Rev2's pretty good
[2:11:35] <BeefyQueefer> world will end before then lmao
[2:11:36] <$floralkami> @frost_quill maybe it's her fucking id over her superego, but that would be too smart of an answer
[2:11:36] <KaseKaizer> D:
[2:11:38] <Ultimatefool> Will Paige be the flashlight partner?
[2:11:39] <%ammobasket> He big boi
[2:11:40] <boogaleeboo> Rev2 is a fucking miracle compared to this
[2:11:41] <$joylent_blue> i played rev 2 with my brother, great fun
[2:11:41] <%xxshadowxx416> but sex
[2:11:41] <+Mumbles519> is paige going to play rev 2 with you?

[2:18:40] <+Meta1spy51> what is this stupid cube
[2:18:40] <Ipsenscastle> Ada knows everything by default, she doesnt need to acquire information or understand things
[2:18:41] <+spodebroker> I feel like I know less about the story than I did before we began
[2:18:41] <%derap41> Nice lip gloss

[2:18:46] <King_Wolf_Rigger> Less convoluted than the MGS timeline.
[2:18:46] <ThatOneGuyYouSaw> Ada pretends to know more than she does to look cool in front of Leon
[2:18:48] <+ArtoriasTheTrenchfighter> Ada NEVER had any answers, she's just suave and composed I guess?

[2:18:56] <%Laecerelius> So why is he helping her again?
[2:18:57] <feralady> the sweet release of death is real
[2:18:57] <kingbaconcrispy> Ada's campaign is not really conclusive.
[2:18:58] <tyrano_the_wise> convenient elevator
[2:18:58] <+BringBackSempai> literally talking to the player
[2:18:58] <TikanZK> "okay i believe you"

[2:19:14] <rosemon5001> WAS that literal motherfucking HOLO CUBE
[2:19:14] <%arcaderabbit48> arcaderabbit48 subscribed at Tier 1. They've subscribed for 11 months, currently on a 11 month streak! RE6 ruins Ada by showing she has no idea what the fuck is going on. She just acts sexy and pretends she knows, so she can mess with Leon. This could be really interesting or fun characterization, but y'know. RE6.
[2:19:15] <corepercentlives> anyway finished re3 demo - man it's soooo gooood
[2:19:17] <StarvingPenguinGod> Cube Phone is the future BrainSlug
[2:19:18] <+mans51> wat
[2:19:18] <%arsonistdaria> Does Ada ever actually know what's happening or does she just act like this all the time
[2:19:20] <King_Wolf_Rigger> This chapter alone is 5 hours long
[2:19:20] <RunningNGunning> 10 more minutes of asset reuse @PatStaresAt

[2:19:32] <Sapphire_Breeze> SIMP: the game
[2:19:32] <Dragon_Batman> Cuz of the supsense, oooooooo
[2:19:34] <+BringBackSempai> You'll find a note from simmons saying "shoot the weak point for massive damage"
[2:19:34] <j0ustar> How is that phone powered even? Nuclear fission?
[2:19:34] <evbites> @tusk102 fuccckkk ooffff really
[2:19:35] <$floralkami> I'm really starting to have Ada so much right now, and it's all this game's fault
[2:19:35] <%Shadicara> FAT
[2:19:35] <$rooooooooooot> WutFace
[2:19:35] <%arcaderabbit48> Good
[2:19:37] <%juxtest> What IS the plot?
[2:19:38] <%Frost_Quill> So Ada doesn't actually know anything she just likes to act mysterious for shits and giggles.
[2:19:38] <Darkfire346> FAT EVIL
[2:19:38] <+Grayhammatter> FAT EVIL
[2:19:39] <nuane> as expected
[2:19:41] <+spodebroker> Wait, there's an ANSWER?
[2:19:41] <%storkeylope> WAIT He has that call with Ada, but still shows up in Leon's call with Hunnigan AT THE SAME TIME @PatStaresAt

[2:19:44] <+JackalKing> What is it?
[2:19:44] <natebud> Some Adas just want to watch the world burn
[2:19:45] <tyrano_the_wise> but i thought rev1 was the worse thing ever? :P
[2:19:47] <%derap41> Man those pants just ride right up in there
[2:19:49] <SociopathicApe> I was going to ask about what's going on in the story, but I see that's pointless.
[2:19:52] <Famonk> yo phoneCube is a ripoff of artemis fowl book 3
[2:19:52] <CloniiCory> @arcaderabbit48 That actually makes me like Ada alot more tbh. She's a fucking dork.
[2:19:53] <+Grayhammatter> fat evil is shaking the screen
[2:19:54] <Dragon_Batman> Gotta build up to the bad
[2:19:55] <%spiritofmojave> what is it
[2:19:56] <boogaleeboo> The plot is simmons did a evil for control, but wants to fuck ada, so he made a scientist into ada and she went crazy
[2:19:58] <stranger59> not shooting emblems?
[2:19:58] <boogaleeboo> the end
[2:19:58] <+ArtoriasTheTrenchfighter> Beware Fat Evil?
[2:19:59] <Sapphire_Breeze> @juxtest Simmons wanted to bang Ada so he cloned her

[2:24:01] <Famonk> believe it
[2:24:01] <$rooooooooooot> is this a bee zone too
[2:24:01] <%Zaphire_Saucypants> was the point of that?
[2:24:01] <dadeaner> i cant believe how long this campaign already feels
[2:24:02] <RunningNGunning> Asset reuse: the campaign
[2:24:04] <ImmaCanuck> Pointless vault sfoxLOL
[2:24:06] <%Niney_Who> @PatStaresAt So Ada's levels are sometimes just normal levels in reverse
[2:24:06] <%Typhaeon> Grade A duh factor
[2:24:07] <natebud> reuse those assets Ada
[2:24:07] <tusk102> !uptime
[2:24:07] <OldOnyx> why not change it's state of existence from a positive to a negative?
[2:24:08] <@Moobot> I've been playing this game for how long? Oh only 2h 24m.
[2:24:08] <+spodebroker> Did the stream quality just go to shit for anyone else?
[2:24:08] <KaliasTV> Blue emblems don't exist shhh
[2:24:09] <qu3kl41n_the_impure_king> remember there is a NUKE incoming
[2:24:09] <Dragon_Batman> with this game it totally is
[2:24:09] <King_Wolf_Rigger> @Chewygamer Collectibles. You shoot them for points.
[2:24:09] <Darkfire346> meanwhile Leon is being chased by a fuckin shark
[2:24:10] <%ahbhajit> @Chewygamer the blue emblems are collectibles. you shoot them
[2:24:10] <%Jekado> oh boy
[2:24:12] <+spodebroker> Or is it just me?
[2:24:13] <CrimsonFox777> Are we still at the cemetery or did we just magic elevator away?
[2:24:15] <%goose_attack_almanac> only doing this now huh
[2:24:18] <%juxtest> Bee Incursion at unsafe levels
[2:24:20] <natebud> What can the final boss possibly be?
[2:24:20] <VodkaVermin> Up and down multiple MILES of caves
[2:24:22] <jacknerik> Demonic activity detected
[2:24:23] <tusk102> @PatStaresAt you've only been playing for like an hour but it feels like its been years
[2:24:25] <$floralkami> WHY NOW??????
[2:24:26] <Fep3> thankfully this game seems to have been cheap to develop, or else there wouldnt be an re7
[2:24:28] <boogaleeboo> Ada is the final boss of ada
[2:24:29] <j0ustar> The game has detected itself
[2:24:29] <nuane> does that really need a notification
[2:24:34] <s1rcuit> "safety" is a very subjective thing for a computer to verify
[2:24:35] <King_Wolf_Rigger> @spodebroker It's fine for me, you might need to refreshh.
[2:24:37] <feralady> hey pat. is this game scary?
[2:24:43] <%Jolnir> 2 kinds of cheese
[2:24:50] <Hellarussian> Flash Kick
[2:24:53] <%Typhaeon> This version of the Pinky Demon sucks
[2:24:54] <+Delenay> how does a computer detect that a bioweapon is awake
[2:24:57] <%biomegabear> I bet ada and ada wont meet. It wouldnt surprise me if the game did that
[2:24:57] <Darkfire346> CRACKSHOOOT
[2:24:57] <KoopySandwichInc> exciting action music of excitement
[2:25:00] <%honeyman18> psaPat_LH
[2:25:00] <+Delenay> or dead
[2:25:01] <s1rcuit> that's just a Pinky
[2:25:01] <SaltyAzteca> OH YEAAAAH
[2:25:02] <boogaleeboo> no wait it's simmons
[2:25:04] <nuane> two of them
[2:25:04] <%goose_attack_almanac> HE DESTROYED THE OTHER CHRYSALIS
[2:25:05] <TalisKanju> I HATE when they do this. Mostly because it doesn't make any sense.
[2:25:06] <boogaleeboo> I forget this piece of shit
[2:25:06] <SociopathicApe> CHARGER!
[2:25:06] <trianglehat> oh fuck this

[2:25:24] <Wolfstriker121> WHAT IS THIS GAME omg!!!
[2:25:26] <%Frost_Quill> I fought this boss at the bottom of the well in Bloodborne. Got the rakuyo and everything.
[2:25:31] <+Jetstream_Artorias> @doc_ock_rokc why would the crossbow not be good?
[2:25:31] <$floralkami> @fep3 oh no, this game has a budget. it was just wasted on explosions and voice acting with terrible dialogue.
[2:25:32] <ajgilmore1> That's right, Jay
[2:25:32] <boogaleeboo> even co-op this game isn't worth remembering
[2:25:35] <%Typhaeon> Can you feel the THRILLING TENSION YET?
[2:25:42] <%WhereIsWill> Can't believe I stopped beastars for THIS WutFace
[2:25:44] <anAngryHamster> We haven't even seen Mr. Chainsawarm yet
[2:25:45] <Ipsenscastle> wait has the UI been Ada's stupid phone cube all along?
[2:25:47] <Hellarussian> music says be thrilled
[2:25:49] <%beepbeepbopbop> The music is so awful
[2:25:50] <AvoidingTheCoronaVirus> gamespot are selling doom a day early
[2:25:51] <+Delenay> tictaks
[2:25:51] <+thelonechris> This music isn't great
[2:25:57] <+Grayhammatter> riveting music
[2:26:01] <%peachy996> all of the music has been terrible
[2:26:02] <%thewordofhelix> fire grenade at door
[2:26:02] <+Jetstream_Artorias> Even ADA is getting bored
[2:26:03] <$rooooooooooot> @WhereIsWill go back beastars is sick
[2:26:03] <tyrano_the_wise> OK...
[2:26:03] <+Chewygamer> same ada, same

[2:26:05] <SMuffinMan> Yup Ipsen
[2:26:08] <doppio_tsuki> I just tried to skip a few seconds ahead but realised this is a livestream and not the youtube vod. I must suffer with Pat
[2:26:09] <%Meekest> Game that's not cute
[2:26:10] <%beepbeepbopbop> Its the same composer as the guy who did MHW
[2:26:10] <heybenice> You eat the spray?
[2:26:16] <+Chewygamer> when even the game is like, "is this shit over yet?"
[2:26:17] <%doc_ock_rokc> That arrow is larger then Ada is
[2:26:17] <$joylent_blue> yeah but then you still have to go to a Gamestop....
[2:26:18] <%Dingus_Tickler> @avoidingthecoronavirus Too bad my paycheck doesn’t come in a day early atpRtsd
[2:26:20] <nuane> haha the game is self aware that makes it okay to suck ahahaha
[2:26:20] <natebud> Put just finding out his weapons are OP
[2:26:21] <Reanimator83> Does anybody know if the RE3 demo is only playable once like the RE2 demo?
[2:26:26] <rat_boy1996> even ada is over it
[2:26:30] <Hellarussian> another one
[2:26:32] <%Typhaeon> This enemy type is so fuckin boring
[2:26:33] <%king_wragles> @PatStaresAt Can the game be over now?
[2:26:38] <Dr_Mooose> why are there so many
[2:26:41] <AvoidingTheCoronaVirus> @Reanimator83 no limit
[2:26:42] <s1rcuit> just remember kids that this perfect bioweapon can be killed by a Chinese lady with a crossbow and tight leather pants
[2:26:43] <Famonk> its never a good idea for a game character to express weariness (except in the narrative sense)
[2:26:44] <+Grayhammatter> flail to die, nice combo
[2:26:44] <TalisKanju> Oh yeah, I forgot that Ada is MUCH WORSE than Leon when it comes to the witty banter.
[2:26:44] <%peachy996> Apparently Twitch doesn't want me to watch this shitshow and keeps stuttering
[2:26:46] <Wolfstriker121> JUST CHEAT
[2:26:47] <$floralkami> isn't DOOM Eternal out already got download? i saw Cirno playing just earlier
[2:26:48] <boogaleeboo> no re3 demo is just there
[2:26:48] <%Louie_Salmon> Piss is exciting
[2:26:49] <King_Wolf_Rigger> Lens flare for days

[2:26:51] <+LampTheLightofTheUniverse> This seems like garbage
[2:26:52] <%WhereIsWill> tactical evade!
[2:26:53] <+Link232> I dunno, pissing's kinda exciting
[2:26:53] <+Chewygamer> these enemies are not threatening at all

[2:26:55] <$rooooooooooot> aight im out have fun guys i cant take this anymore
[2:26:55] <SMuffinMan> I love those rock dudes actually for some reason
[2:26:56] <AvoidingTheCoronaVirus> JUST TURN IT OFF PAT
[2:26:57] <%derap41> Exciting music does not excitement make
[2:26:59] <Giant_Key> The music suggests you are having fun
[2:27:02] <studleydoorite> just 5 more
[2:27:03] <Hellarussian> never let this gem of a game die
[2:27:03] <Reanimator83> That’s good to hear
[2:27:03] <%MonsieurHedge> this is literally just Warframe
[2:27:04] <+dirtyh4rr1> this is duller than pissing
[2:27:06] <+Grayhammatter> this is real bad
[2:27:07] <%Anime_Flux> I thought someone said this was almost over...

[2:33:14] <%spiritofmojave> It's like RE5, "THEY'RE SICK, KILL"
[2:33:15] <%doc_ock_rokc> @PatStaresAt You take it because people said it would make you stronger
[2:33:17] <+Jetstream_Artorias> Is the backflip meant to be Ada's quick shot
[2:33:19] <+Kriptin> Chris
[2:33:22] <Sjotyme_> ADAAAA!

[2:33:29] <snekUrgentPls> didnt chris do it
[2:33:31] <tyrano_the_wise> IT IS THOUGH
[2:33:32] <jijipose> Chris did that
[2:33:33] <black_pariah> they can reason but theyre homicidal
[2:33:34] <scrublordsamurai> los lamo
[2:33:34] <wrydiculous> it was Chris
[2:33:34] <Explodincatz> Wrong Kong
[2:33:36] <%doc_ock_rokc> Wuhong

[2:33:42] <%MrNoobMcSalt> psaCrazyhand psaCrazyhead
[2:33:42] <%trekkie11041> THAT WAS CHRIS AND HE DID IT
[2:33:43] <%InugamiTheHound> I thought it was a fart gas from a fat evil monster
[2:33:45] <+SundanceShot> chris does it, he nerd shoves a camera man out of the way
[2:33:45] <TalisKanju> Shut up Ada
[2:33:45] <natebud> @PatStaresAt that was in the game, you saw it
[2:33:46] <KeystoneA1> The RE6 is rotting your brain; it was Chris and it did happen
[2:33:47] <srkAres> it was the first cutscene i think
[2:33:47] <+Grayhammatter> LUL
[2:33:48] <Hellarussian> and thats the end of that convo
[2:33:49] <tusk102> @PatStaresAt chris does it and its in teh game
[2:33:50] <Monkeyweed21> CHRIS DID THAT
[2:33:50] <Ipsenscastle> Pat is actively erasing the game from his brain as he plays it
[2:33:50] <+TomasoChocotaco> I try to not think about RE6
[2:33:52] <KaiserMario> Then why bring it up?
[2:33:53] <cesare92x> its like the first five minutes of chris campaign
[2:33:54] <%mMayrro> that's a you problem LUL
[2:33:55] <ZComiX> He did do it tho
[2:33:55] <+Bwsdante> dont eat the bat soup
[2:33:56] <+Jetstream_Artorias> Chris' first playable sequence in China has him pushing a camera man aside as he marches down the road
[2:33:57] <Dragon_Batman> that is fine
[2:33:58] <olwe123> that was Chris
[2:33:59] <%spiritofmojave> oh god
[2:34:00] <missingangle> It's that bad, huh
[2:34:00] <smig> Pat at risk
[2:34:02] <wrydiculous> Wrong Kong
[2:34:03] <rytisone> Pat's brain is closed
[2:34:03] <+jiggy_snipe> it was 1st cutscene when Chris came to China
[2:34:05] <tyrano_the_wise> Its the first thing on Chris campaign
[2:34:07] <Hellarussian> grasping at straws for anything
[2:34:13] <BeefyQueefer> One Night In Wong
[2:34:15] <Gimplock> good morning everyone
[2:34:15] <Sapphire_Breeze> help
[2:34:17] <%derap41> Good that the power is still on
[2:34:17] <olwe123> and it the first he does in his campain
[2:34:17] <s1rcuit> @PatStaresAt the C-Virus is rotting your brain
[2:34:18] <%spiritofmojave> Pat's brain practicing memory distancing
[2:34:18] <%asgard147> you can do it Pat
[2:34:18] <maybefalco> the real infection comes from playing RE6
[2:34:18] <+lethallylactic> Doom Eternal is releasing a day early?! PogChamp
[2:34:18] <+SundanceShot> this game is fucking brain poison
[2:34:19] <CloniiCory> Hit the bumper if you want nav points.
[2:34:21] <+tangoragahn> !Memory At Risk!
[2:34:21] <scrublordsamurai> #RE6 BrainRot
[2:34:23] <tusk102> @PatStaresAt i'm glad that ada destroyed the evidence that would clear her name
[2:34:29] <+Grayhammatter> nice quick scope
[2:34:30] <%Anime_Flux> HIYAHH!
[2:34:33] <Plague_bagel> oh is the chainsaw guy that doesnt make any sense coming up?
[2:34:39] <Dragon_Batman> surprised Paige isn't here to just conversate
[2:34:39] <%damienlunas> Hey Pat, would you say RE6 had some good ideas, but poor execution? psaSmug
[2:34:40] <tyrano_the_wise> I guess my dad was right about games roting your brain
[2:34:41] <%Typhaeon> It's the coolest
[2:34:41] <+Axellogic> Hipfiring a sniper is a rifle is rad
[2:34:47] <+thelonechris> No scoping
[2:34:48] <rytisone> 360 no scope
[2:34:49] <smig> yeah chainsaw man is coming up on the bus
[2:34:55] <MrDonTacos_> no time for that pat
[2:34:56] <%ammobasket> Photoshop
[2:34:57] <+gibbetterinternet> because everyone would think she is dead
[2:35:00] <%Jolnir> remember when capcom didnt need migami and kamiya to make a good game
[2:35:00] <Ipsenscastle> snipe with the hips for extra power
[2:35:00] <+jiggy_snipe> cuz she's dumb
[2:35:01] <RunningNGunning> So she would look bad ass to no one
[2:35:01] <%spiritofmojave> shutup tho
[2:35:01] <King_Wolf_Rigger> This is the question I asked 10 minutes ago
[2:35:03] <RavenHellkite> there is no time
[2:35:04] <%MonsieurHedge> why DO they instantly strip naked on death
[2:35:08] <%derap41> OK that's kinda cool
[2:35:08] <$Mekhet09> Why was he naked for a second then not naked
[2:35:10] <cesare92x> SHE SAVED THE EVIDENCE AND GIVE IT TO LEON AT THE END ARE YOU SERIOUS BRO?
[2:35:12] <Dragon_Batman> Capcom wanted to keep the whole spy shit most likely
[2:35:13] <%MonsieurHedge> does RE share a universe with the anime titty ninja game
[2:35:14] <%Typhaeon> oh no Great Jagras
[2:35:17] <+Grayhammatter> oh good, a dinosaur
[2:35:17] <%peachy996> flail wildly
[2:35:18] <%derap41> The axe thing not this thing
[2:35:19] <zeif00> Are there headshots in this game?
[2:35:20] <%JusTTheGuyYouNeed> she did not want her nudes to leak
[2:35:22] <scrublordsamurai> cause the writing is bad
[2:35:22] <Ipsenscastle> why the jagrases?
[2:35:23] <natebud> because it's all a game to her. Destorying china is funny
[2:35:23] <+hawk_rush> is this monsster hunter?
[2:35:24] <Sjotyme_> I beat this game years ago and do not remember this shit
[2:35:24] <KatabolicRage> this guy gives me jurassic park 1 vibes
[2:35:24] <rubbishbinge> because shes playing hard 2 get ;)
[2:35:24] <tyrano_the_wise> i hate those dinosaurs
[2:35:25] <%peachy996> Stick Stupid
[2:35:25] <$RetroCop87> To be fair, Ada's on-record file already includes genocide, so she probably doesn't care about another city or two
[2:35:28] <corepercentlives> No Time To Remember
[2:35:29] <+BubbaRands> Jagras PogChamp
[2:35:29] <%Frost_Quill> Ada is more and more revealed to be someone who doesn't know what they're doing and just acts mysterious to get by.
[2:35:31] <%peachy996> No wonder you're extinct
[2:35:32] <rosemon5001> LITERALLY MMH
[2:35:33] <%MonsieurHedge> thats a fuckin alien
[2:35:33] <Hellarussian> is this real life?
[2:35:34] <%TIME_PUNCHER> PAT this is RE6 . NO LOGIC ALLOWED
[2:35:35] <Lordkeyblade> because no one would belive there was a clone of her cause that's dumb (looks at bio weapons) yeah dumb
[2:35:35] <+CrimsonDio11> what is that UI and why is it objectively bad
[2:35:40] <+MisterRockett> Is that a fucking Jagras?

[2:35:53] <%CrookedSpiral> Why is there a Dino Crisis happening?
[2:35:55] <%Zaphire_Saucypants> Is it just fantasy?
[2:35:58] <$floralkami> @cesare92x look, there's a lot of shit going on, and not all of it if gonna stay in the waste bucket, okay???
[2:36:00] <King_Wolf_Rigger> @MonsieurHedge Ninja Gaiden? I dunno, but that would be pretty radical.
[2:36:01] <s1rcuit> the terrorists are tougher without the virus
[2:36:01] <natebud> No one would believe this video evidence, it's too stupid

[2:36:12] <Plague_bagel> this game really doesnt know what it wants its enemy design to be

[2:36:30] <tyrano_the_wise> more dino crisis
[2:36:31] <zmuno> Infection!!! thats why!!
[2:36:32] <Dr_Mooose> nothing is cooler than money
[2:36:34] <BeefyQueefer> money is the greatest kind of point
[2:36:35] <%TIME_PUNCHER> remember, logic bad. big evil

[2:36:54] <%Drusain> yes zombie dinosaurs
[2:36:55] <+Keiyum> to be fair, points are cooler than money. Imagine you're at your job racking up points to spend at the shop.

[2:37:07] <tusk102> @PatStaresAt them killing random civilians is even dumber cuz they should be trying to infect them for more soldiers but don't
[2:37:09] <King_Wolf_Rigger> @Ipsenscastle The Monster Hunter series on handholds were literally the only thing keeping them afloat lol.
[2:37:09] <%damienlunas> At least it avoids the problem of "Why is this ancient American catacombs zombie dropping Chinese yuan"
[2:37:11] <nuane> he got bored and left
[2:37:11] <%Dhurkst> Do the infected enemies' voice clips sound compressed?
[2:37:13] <tyrano_the_wise> parkour dinosaurs?
[2:37:15] <rosemon5001> filthy jagrases not letting the young hunter ada get the horns carved

[2:38:11] <$Afterman_> Kappa
[2:38:14] <tusk102> @PatStaresAt them killing random civilians for no reason is even dumber when you think of the fact they should be trying to infect them for more soldiers but don't

[2:38:34] <CloniiCory> Leon never fought J'avo and no one else other than Ada fought Zombies.
[2:38:34] <$lotharrio> Is that what makes Leon so efficient and capable? His lack of bapo experience?

[2:39:38] <Monkeyweed21> The crocodile was okay in Remake 2
[2:39:38] <SMuffinMan> Sometimes
[2:39:39] <+riscuit> in uncharted they had some and it was kind of cool with the camera man
[2:39:39] <natebud> It's fine in uncharted

[2:39:47] <black_pariah> only in tomb raider nowhere else
[2:39:48] <+MisterRockett> They were good in Crash Bandicoot and only Crash Bandicoot
[2:39:48] <rosemon5001> yes in kh3 the trains sequenses are great
[2:39:48] <Famonk> the IQ of this series dropped 100 points over the course of RE4 and RE5, you can't convince me otherwise
[2:39:50] <nuane> homeboy's goin wild

[2:52:00] <rytisone> cutscene bullet
[2:52:01] <%Dhurkst> @tigerfang86 par for the course for this series, tbh
[2:52:02] <CaptainFrankincense> when wesker fucked her butt
[2:52:02] <%derap41> Cause you don't get to control this game pat its a strong indepented game that needs no player
[2:52:02] <DraxTD> so @PatStaresAt , if you play RE3 tonight does that mean we'll get a worse plague or Rona will go away?
[2:52:02] <tusk102> nice
[2:52:03] <SwindlerOfProgress> They're cutscene bullets, Pat FailFish
[2:52:04] <SaltyAzteca> @PatStaresAt You didnt shoot it hard enough
[2:52:04] <$floralkami> tbf, your use a wet broom to scrub the blood of the floor before mopping it
[2:52:05] <%peachy996> You mean William and Wesker
[2:52:06] <%Drusain> BUT ANNETTE TRIED TO KILL HER
[2:52:06] <ThespianBarrage> There's a spot on the head, that when you shoot it, it explodes.
[2:52:07] <tusk102> that was good actually
[2:52:07] <zmuno> @StebTheVee thats the answer
[2:52:08] <%tigerfang86> REMEMBER WHEN WESKER AND ALSO BIRKIN FUCKED HER OVER
[2:52:08] <Hydrapissed> i mean ehhh
[2:52:08] <%mMayrro> Ada's VA is so good

[2:52:09] <%asgard147> yeah, it is
[2:52:09] <+conradical> what was the line
[2:52:10] <+Jetstream_Artorias> Wait, that line makes it sound like Ada's about to kill Jake and Sherry
[2:52:10] <KaiserMario> BEST GAME
[2:52:10] <toyforus235> she shot her
[2:52:11] <%tigerfang86> GOOD TIMES
[2:52:12] <Plague_bagel> these stages are toooooooo long
[2:52:12] <natebud> but what if you do nothing
[2:52:12] <%biomegabear> WHY?>
[2:52:17] <Pyon84> This camera is nutz
[2:52:17] <iamnotaparrot> re6 was worth it
[2:52:18] <%LaughingCatt> This random chainsaw zombie is more like Nemesis than the shitheel in Jake's campaign
[2:52:19] <tolloponik> her dialogue sounds like what someone thinks a cool person says
[2:52:19] <%toolofparanoia> tHAT LINE GAVE ME BIG CHILLS
[2:52:21] <+jiggy_snipe> how did she know Jake was Wesker's kid?
[2:52:21] <Famonk> Ada are you going to be able to stop them from being imprisoned in a creepy umbrella cell
[2:52:21] <evbites> when have they been kind to you
[2:52:23] <Divantae> yep
[2:52:25] <JonEWorldbeater> Maybe they should've tried making one good game instead of stitching together four shitty games
[2:52:25] <mrshazboto> This game seems great. Don't understand the complaint
[2:52:26] <HappyCutePhoenix> That sign with titties is in japanese. So it isn't China.... It is Japan... @PatStaresAt
[2:52:26] <+conradical> big oof
[2:52:28] <%asgard147> just a shame it's in RE6!
[2:52:29] <%Drusain> Yeah but Annette tried to kill her so it makes no sense
[2:52:30] <%FalseEyeD> Birkin shot HER
[2:52:30] <%Rain_Mage> Wait how does she know who Jake's father?
[2:52:30] <%tigerfang86> I R O N Y
[2:52:31] <%Typhaeon> How does she know Weasker's his dad, or did I miss that part
[2:52:31] <StebTheVee> Annette
[2:52:33] <%Jack_of_No_Trades> This is when Pat finally admits this is a good game
[2:52:34] <%mckraven> Is she gonna bitch slap sherry off a bridge
[2:52:35] <%peachy996> Oh wait Annette Birkin I forgot
[2:52:35] <toyforus235> sherry mom shot her

[2:52:36] <Ipsenscastle> Annette shot her?
[2:52:38] <Hellarussian> i memba

[2:52:50] <%ahbhajit> it's a joke guys, Ada is showing a personality
[2:52:50] <natebud> Was Wesker bad to Ada?
[2:52:50] <tusk102> that line was good bc she was being sarcastic guys
[2:52:52] <Hellarussian> Ada got backhanded into a bad game
[2:52:55] <%Rain_Mage> @PatStaresAt How does she know that Wesker is Jake's father?
[2:52:56] <SlappyMeats> yeah Ada bodied Annette super hard
[2:52:57] <%Agami23> william clawed her
[2:52:57] <megaman_sentinel> they try 2 kill her lul
[2:52:57] <tusk102> ada was being sarcastic
[2:52:59] <%toolofparanoia> BIRKIN AND WESKER aka Science fuckbuddies
[2:52:59] <nuane> that grapple hook
[2:53:01] <%tigerfang86> @ThatOneGuyYouSaw ah, you're a man of culture as well
[2:53:02] <evbites> was wesker good to ada?
[2:53:03] <Darkfire346> remember how Ada survived a 200ft drop somehow?
[2:53:03] <TalisKanju> It's only notable because she knew Birkin and Wesker
[2:53:06] <%peachy996> @natebud well in RE4 he wasn't exactly great to her
[2:53:06] <ThatOneGuyYouSaw> @Rain_Mage she read the script
[2:53:09] <jacknerik> oh god RE6 is killing brain cells
[2:53:09] <%PlainSimpleTailor> That stupid Batclaw
[2:53:12] <ThespianBarrage> The more you play, the less you know
[2:53:13] <%Typhaeon> what an exciting running sequence
[2:53:14] <tusk102> @evbites not really. see re4
[2:53:15] <tyrano_the_wise> HOW?
[2:53:16] <krymzen5> why doesn't everyone have one of these grappling hooks? seems real useful
[2:53:17] <+Grayhammatter> what the fuck is this section? whar are we even doing?
[2:53:18] <KaiserMario> Man, Ada's really agile for a 50 year old lady
[2:53:19] <+Javaa01> RE canon? Confusing? Never
[2:53:19] <boogaleeboo> Now you have documented evidence of you playing RE6, and can just point people at it

[3:46:26] <%CalderGaming> THAT'S not a glavenus move
[3:46:27] <Crudmaster420> bullets clearly do nothing
[3:46:28] <%Mr_Strut> I THOUGHT THAT SHIT WAS A STREAM BUG
[3:46:29] <Radski5> This reminds me of the problem Bioshock 2 had where, despite being a Big Daddy, you moved like any other rando joe. You're supposed to be shooting a big turret in a helicopter but it controls like... this.
[3:46:30] <medril07> is that a motherfucking t-rex?
[3:46:31] <%gespenst25> King Crimson??!?!?
[3:46:34] <ZeeJiggle> That's fine
[3:46:34] <$RetroCop87> who?

[3:46:41] <rageknightlive> They totally did
[3:46:42] <Nekros4442> Yeah that really does look similar
[3:46:42] <tolloponik> thats just sad man
[3:46:44] <KazMkII> Doesn't this predate Glav?
[3:46:45] <C24U> Re-used? Didn't this come out like 5 years beforehand though?
[3:46:45] <%PrettyThickandStrongDyck> Who?
[3:46:45] <jorniev> WHAT
[3:46:45] <Aydarkzero> yeah that's actually Glav
[3:46:45] <silverira> THIS IS HELL PLAYING RE6 OVER AND OVER AGAIN
[3:46:45] <%Typhaeon> Glavenus would actually be cool though
[3:46:46] <%Alpha8087> Feels more like Anjanath
[3:46:47] <@SSaryn> Just slower yeah
[3:46:48] <%Shady_Squid> That is TOTALLY a glavinus animation, that backflip is 100% one of his moves
[3:46:49] <%Dhurkst> other way around
[3:46:49] <ImmaCanuck> Just reuse assets 4Head
[3:46:50] <%michingmallecho> The game wants to end itself

[3:46:53] <%Shadicara> Glav came after pat lUL
[3:46:53] <Nina96> @PatStaresAt was this after generations?
[3:46:54] <%YakumoYomi> Other way around. This came first
[3:46:55] <Onamar> This game is OLDER than Monster Hunter Generations
[3:46:55] <+Grayhammatter> they totally did
[3:46:55] <$Sphincter_Spelunker> Still going huh
[3:46:56] <Dragon_Batman> honestly why wouldn't they
[3:46:58] <Daxalog> Dont you have alt fire missles or anything?

[3:47:10] <%jiin6> but he used it tho
[3:47:11] <ThatOneGuyYouSaw> he was using it, tho
[3:47:12] <EuropanLamprey> Again, does Ada speak only in one-liners?
[3:47:12] <%weissguard> **Deviljho
[3:47:12] <24hrcinderella> Operation Too Big To Fail
[3:47:12] <%Jekado> you should aim for the tail then so you get an additional carve tho

[3:47:13] <%doc_ock_rokc> He created ada with the c virus

[4:20:35] <%ironhoundgaming> just got into ff14 and man does that game play well
[4:20:36] <LonePlus_> well like
[4:20:41] <ThatOneGuyYouSaw> I ate a clock; it was time consuming.
[4:20:42] <atema128> @spinningchurro Woolie has less viewers because his stream isn’t live anymore. It literally just ended.
[4:20:43] <$Sphincter_Spelunker> hey, what planet is Woolie on in Kotor 2? I've only been watching the youtube uploads
[4:20:45] <%SWFanatic> rock and stone

[4:20:55] <LonePlus_> but still not friday
[4:20:57] <%torontototoro> torontototoro subscribed with Twitch Prime. They've subscribed for 10 months! Hey Pat. What do you and Paige consider the best silver linings to self-isolating? (Besides the steady income from streaming). Personally, I'm enjoying giving my dogs more walkies without as many disgusting people clogging up the parks and sidewalks.
[4:20:58] <24hrcinderella> Maybe RE6
[4:20:58] <Swish20XX> Doom might actually unlock tonight
[4:20:59] <%Skittlesoul> @spinningchurro i mean woolie also has his own YouTube channel that gets better traction than pats
[4:20:59] <%xeros720> eh, i was hoping midnight est
[4:21:11] <%spiritofmojave> I caved and had to get the Switch skin + game
[4:21:17] <brandedyoshi> I already went and preordered the royal edition of P5R, So I ain't getting that shit right now
[4:21:19] <%YakumoYomi> @ThatOneGuyYouSaw BOO! BOO-URNS!
[4:21:22] <%spiritofmojave> hopefully it reaches in the mail rn lol
[4:21:24] <%peachy996> Doom still has 1 day on my PS4
[4:21:27] <24hrcinderella> @spiritofmojave It’s a sexy design
[4:21:33] <giandeli> giandeli subscribed with Twitch Prime. 
[4:21:35] <JonEWorldbeater> Wouldn't it be awful if 3make just sucked?
[4:21:38] <Swish20XX> I know about the Gamestop thing but I figured that wouldn't mean Steam
[4:21:39] <LonePlus_> i preordered resident evil and animal crossing on the same fuckin day
[4:21:42] <%spiritofmojave> @24hrcinderella honestly, yeyeye
[4:21:43] <$Sphincter_Spelunker> @torontototoro not exactly self isolating, the virus can last in the air for up to 3 hours
[4:21:48] <%xeros720> don't see how it could, it's pretty much re2make
[4:21:50] <tiaramaki> @JonEWorldbeater I would be devastated
[4:21:50] <atema128> @sphincter_spelunker He’s on Nar Shadda.
[4:21:50] <LonePlus_> and ive just been sitting with my thumb up my ass waiting for a month
[4:21:56] <$Sphincter_Spelunker> @atema128 thank you
[4:21:58] <%peachy996> Seriously though go Digital for Preorders
[4:22:02] <%Run44forrest> buying persona 5 AGAIN daphLol
[4:22:05] <%peachy996> They are way more painless
[4:22:10] <Saltmeisterr> I still need to get money for ACNH
[4:22:10] <%Flightedwings> Flightedwings subscribed with Twitch Prime. They've subscribed for 15 months, currently on a 3 month streak! 
[4:22:14] <LonePlus_> digital is more convienent
[4:22:15] <%spiritofmojave> That and FF7 are gonna leave me broke in a couple weeks
[4:22:17] <+MeatBomb> Lol. I muted the stream and was complaining about the audio. ONE GUY
[4:22:25] <LonePlus_> i havent bought a game physical in like 6 years
[4:22:27] <%spiritofmojave> which is garbage time given everythimg
[4:22:37] <mattdel92> Only do digital preorder if your getting extra stuff
[4:22:37] <%torontototoro> @Sphincter_Spelunker i should've rephrased that to something like "society changing with the virus"
[4:22:40] <%peachy996> I have 2 Physical Copies of a game and thats it
[4:22:40] <lionandfox21> Is the demo now available on the store? I'm on the wwest coast and haven
[4:22:47] <ThatOneGuyYouSaw> Ok, when Pat comes back, we should all pretend that the audio is out.
[4:22:48] <lionandfox21> tseen it yet
[4:22:49] <ShichiNoBushi> I still prefer physical copies because I don't like game taking up my storage space.
[4:22:52] <TheArrow_> ff7 might not be delivered to me on time :(
[4:22:56] <linkoftermina> !uptime
[4:22:57] <@Moobot> I've been playing this game for how long? Oh only 4h 22m.
[4:23:02] <%ironhoundgaming> i cant wait till the imperium of man exterminatos our plant because its been effected by papa nurgle
[4:23:13] <Sanyle> !raffle
[4:23:13] <Divantae> same here, I go for a mix between physical and digital
[4:23:18] <LonePlus_> you guys ever try this keto shit
[4:23:20] <%Run44forrest> @lionandfox21 idk im in texas just checked under demos and under the re3 game page n nothing
[4:23:25] <LonePlus_> cant get much for sweet snack wise
[4:23:25] <BallinArbiter> Sure wish I had money for new games
[4:23:25] <%Valdorick> Oh good, my raid is done in time for a GOOD game, now.
[4:23:27] <ShichiNoBushi> @ironhoundgaming But this is Holy Terra.
[4:23:28] <TYBGerritt> Pat used the NZ account he made for the RE2 demo to get it @lionandfox21
[4:23:30] <%peachy996> @ShichiNoBushi I bougt a harddrive for mine, I prefer digital because I'm too lazy to swap discs now
[4:23:31] <%Keyd00d> It's Australia and NZ only
[4:23:33] <LonePlus_> i got these hazelnut cup things
[4:23:35] <%peachy996> It's too convienent
[4:23:36] <%spiritofmojave> @thearrow_ sameee. i had to select the non-priority option, sorta felt bad lol
[4:23:38] <%Keyd00d> or at least not USA
[4:23:39] <LonePlus_> and it was like someone nutted in my mouth
[4:23:39] <mattdel92> There is no reason to preorder digital standard edition. Because if you wait then you find out if its good or not, then download it
[4:23:41] <LonePlus_> it was awful
[4:23:53] <$Sphincter_Spelunker> @torontototoro it's been raining all week in my part of the world, at least it kept people inside. For now
[4:23:59] <%YakumoYomi> @LonePlus_ I don't think I could give up sugar. I love birthday cake too much.
[4:24:05] <%코코꾸라> YEYEYEYE
