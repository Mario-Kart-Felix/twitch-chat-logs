[0:24:14] <Doomac> NV best game
[0:24:15] <%OwlLightningMage> New Vegas is so good
[0:24:16] <circular7> but he needs to murder more so...
[0:24:19] <%ElenaManetta> It gives me a heart attack because every load screen is a possible soft crash.
[0:24:19] <%cureneckbeard> Owing too many guns is the American way.
[0:24:21] <+WizardofWazz> @AngriestPat its a comfy game
[0:24:23] <%kiiiirsten> New Vegas was my comfort game for a long time
[0:24:24] <%SpamKingRathalos> NV is a hella good game
[0:24:25] <%ThatGuyfromMars> New Vegas is great like that
[0:24:26] <%snow_bush> You have found peace
[0:24:27] <%Laecerelius> Storage go down, but GUN GO UP!
[0:24:32] <%OwlLightningMage> I'm so excited for Outer Worlds
[0:24:34] <petergohan> New Vegas is the BEST fallout game.
[0:24:34] <ArcticAsylum> It is very easy to get lost in this game and end up playing all fucking day
[0:24:35] <NerdyAttackHelicopter> The nra is purple dickin’ at dem guns
[0:24:36] <reddeadwine1277> Gun Kata go up

[0:24:42] <AmericanaRed> Is this 76 ? 4Head
[0:24:43] <$ooblagis> You don't need both the Dinnerbell AND the Riot
[0:24:44] <CutCombo> lone wanderer
[0:24:45] <dekkitout> oh imma wonderer!
[0:24:46] <circular7> kiryu is sad
[0:24:47] <alrobot2014> @AngriestPat you've conquered the deathclaw promontory, but do you think you can beat the LEGENDARY BLOATFLY
[0:24:47] <ComradeConquistador> New Vegas is a great game for comfy times.
[0:24:48] <Doomac> Dinner AND riot?
[0:24:49] <%ThatGuyfromMars> Once you got all your mods sorted, you get to just kinda chill on the strip
[0:24:51] <fruit_pie_the_magician> Holy shit Revenant's thrall ability works on the fucking Stalker, Pat. Shit's fucked, he goes and attacks enemies
[0:24:54] <%valriot> FO is that kind of series, even 4 is the same, shit dialogue asidd
[0:24:56] <+TastySammiches> I roam around n'round n'round n'round n'round
[0:24:57] <%dickbuttwoman> @angriestpat It's a game that has a button that says "When things get crazy, just tap me and we stop"
[0:24:59] <$Pantsravaganza> just plugged in a new pc. kept hitting my head for no reason
[0:25:01] <+Mr_Initials> Thot gun
[0:25:02] <$ooblagis> Dinner Bell is unique though
[0:25:07] <FourLeafLover> Dinner Bell is much more efficient
[0:25:09] <Zzross_the_savagezz> Mass Effect 1 is my comfort game
[0:25:09] <%LocDogX86X> Dinner Bell is actually better
[0:25:10] <@Moobot> Whoa I don't even shout that much! (@alcors_wisdom)
[0:25:10] <calistarios> @petergohan well at least untill the outer worlds come out
[0:25:12] <%Finalknightmare> RIOT
[0:25:12] <+Redpointshine> Hey Pattington, hows New Vegas
[0:25:12] <Doomac> Riot is cool for the fire rate
[0:25:13] <ape_hawk> why not both?
[0:25:13] <%lewdskeletor13> RING A DING BABY
[0:25:14] <%Ell1ot> Pat, Why does RedBull like Woolie more than you?
[0:25:14] <sileo_patronus> Test both out more I guess
[0:25:17] <alrobot2014> BOTH
[0:25:18] <ScreamingMeat> Dinnerbell
[0:25:19] <jobbedbone> NOTHINGS RIGHT I'M TORN
[0:25:20] <%ArchimerDreatect> dinnerbel''s pellet spread is rediculously small, it may aswel be hunting rifle mk.2
[0:25:20] <FracturedImage> Dbell has better range i think?
[0:25:24] <Fujiwara_92> DINNER BELL IS BETTER
[0:25:25] <+aslfrasle> @AngriestPat DId you hear Bethesda is selling a $280 Fallout 76 Leather Jacket? Bets on how long before it's a huge fail?
[0:25:26] <reddeadwine1277> Dinner Bell is sexy, Riot is a better tool
[0:25:26] <jobbedbone> I'M ALL OUT OF FAITH
[0:25:27] <+TastySammiches> riot shotgun does more damage, dinner bell is prettier
[0:25:27] <weissguard> @reiju_22 TY dude. Found his channel.
[0:25:28] <ArcticAsylum> RIOT SHOTGUN SO GOOD
[0:25:28] <wakeuplvl3> i think dinnerbell can be modded
[0:25:29] <hassanico> Dinnerbell hits harder but Riot Gun is so much faster
[0:25:29] <%DavidSanChan> pat is so natalie imbruglia
[0:25:31] <PineappleBison> Dinne bell is WAY cooler
[0:25:32] <%NuclearLawlocausto> I'd got Riot Shotgun
[0:25:32] <dekkitout> akimbo them fine ladies
[0:25:33] <%ThatGuyfromMars> @valriot I just hate when Bethesda goes full movie plot on me, and sidelines the goofier stuff about Fallout
[0:25:35] <$Brother_Coduss> @AngriestPat can use both, they use seperate ammo
[0:25:36] <Inebriateddonut> Hunting shotgun > every other gun in the game
[0:25:36] <$SGrim> @AngriestPat range and damage, versus dps
[0:25:40] <Doomac> Riot is great for special ammo spam
[0:25:40] <%SpamKingRathalos> riot shotgun
[0:25:42] <Redchimera45> Dinner Bell SOUNDS way better
[0:25:44] <FourLeafLover> Yea but cool shotgun sounds
[0:25:44] <%ThatGuyfromMars> @Inebriateddonut my man
[0:25:45] <%ThePuddingDead> Its good to have a close range back up Pat
[0:25:49] <$ooblagis> Dinner Bell is fun and unique
[0:25:50] <%SpamKingRathalos> riot shotgun looks cooler
[0:25:51] <evbites> dinner bell
[0:25:51] <natebud> third person reload is great too ont he dinner bell
[0:25:53] <%Shillk> just use both
[0:25:56] <%homelesstwinky> both are hilarious with your perks
[0:25:56] <ScreamingMeat> Then use the Fun Gun
[0:25:58] <%TheSpiritof2277> Riot Shotgun with that auto is beautiful tho. Style over power
[0:25:58] <%ThatGuyfromMars> Hunting shotgun is the best
[0:25:59] <%lewdskeletor13> DO WHAT YOU WANT
[0:26:00] <blankwaffle> shooting fun is more important
[0:26:02] <ArcticAsylum> I love the Hunting Shotgun but the Riot fire rate is really great for big battles
[0:26:04] <Fujiwara_92> USE BOTH, DUAL WIELD THEM l
[0:26:05] <%ArchimerDreatect> Dinner Bell is for people who never want to not use a shotgun
[0:26:08] <Migatte_no_Gokui_Yamcha> Just use Fell Cleave VoHiYo
[0:26:09] <SephirKath> !uptime
[0:26:09] <@Moobot> I've been playing this game for how long? Oh only 26m 11s.
[0:26:12] <alrobot2014> then do fun for most situations and riot for emergencies?
[0:26:14] <$ooblagis> Do you collect uniques, or jsut sell the ones you don't use?
[0:26:16] <$Brother_Coduss> wait, i thought the riot shotgun was a 20 guage
[0:26:16] <Doomac> Why remove pulse gun when it covers robot matchup so well?
[0:26:17] <hassanico> Nothing materiel, kid
[0:26:18] <%king_wragles> Both are actually pretty good in separate scenarios
[0:26:24] <%kiiiirsten> @ooblagis He sells 'em
[0:26:26] <%king_wragles> @AngriestPat where's the power armor?
[0:26:27] <%LocDogX86X> I love Raul

[0:27:32] <%ElenaManetta> Is it this game or Fallout 3 that has the vault where there's a matrix level of a happy neighborhood and you have to escape the virtual reality?
[0:27:34] <%ThatGuyfromMars> @ImWeeabooJesus Check the first part of the playthrough on youtube, it has a jpg of the mods he's using
[0:27:37] <fruit_pie_the_magician> PAT OWB HAS SKELETONS iN IT

[0:27:51] <sileo_patronus> What do you even need to buy at this point?
[0:27:52] <Redchimera45> is ED-E carrying that Enclave power armor?
[0:27:53] <%badchoice5> Pat, we need to talk about your Red Bull problem
[0:27:54] <%OwlLightningMage> You could use more though
[0:27:56] <%kiiiirsten> You have a lot of MUN-NY
[0:27:56] <%PenmanLupine> @ElenaManetta that's 3
[0:27:58] <%king_wragles> Seriously, didn't Pat have power armor?
[0:27:59] <+half_awake1> but you could always have more monies
[0:28:00] <%OwlLightningMage> You could use some gold
[0:28:01] <WorstCompany> @angriestpat alright, why don’t we find some Ranger Stations for Return to Sender?
[0:28:03] <ComradeConquistador> Many green men from history times.
[0:28:03] <couch_potato_Ed_Boy> I'm thinking about the little things that make New Vegas a great fucking game. One of those things now is the fact your unequipped gun is on your back to see. That's saddening as a selling point now. :(
[0:28:03] <%ToxInjection> but... but you could have MORE monies.
[0:28:04] <%PipIV> MUNEH
[0:28:06] <%SpamKingRathalos> fiends unite!
[0:28:06] <alexandrecau> Pat has no kids and three moneys
[0:28:06] <$ooblagis> You should grab the All-American to cover medium range and swarms
[0:28:06] <LabTech41> @AngriestPat yeah, past a certain wealth level, it's only OCD that keeps you looting bodies.
[0:28:07] <FourLeafLover> Why are the plasma bolts so slow
[0:28:08] <%ThatGuyfromMars> is there a mod that adds liam neeson into New Vegas
[0:28:08] <%PipIV> GOOOOL
[0:28:10] <+WizardofWazz> Fight The Powa!
[0:28:14] <%FrostMass22> Pat, spend some of your munni at a Moogle shop
[0:28:15] <%PenmanLupine> @ElenaManetta that quest is called Tranquility Lane
[0:28:15] <%PipIV> Dollas
[0:28:16] <%Nedlin> But what about MORE moneys?
[0:28:16] <dekkitout> row row
[0:28:17] <hauntingstarfish> better yet, do the silver rush quest so you can see cass die
[0:28:17] <+SassyGamerLady> @angriestpat What mods are you using? Game doesn’t look that good on my pc, lol
[0:28:20] <%PlainSimpleTailor> I wish this game had better gunplay though
[0:28:22] <%milhousego> Howd you get so much monies?

[0:28:45] <evbites> watching how pat plays new vegas is weird but oddly satisfying
[0:28:47] <%ThatGuyfromMars> @PlainSimpleTailor if you liked Fallout 4's gunplay, someone's doing a remake of NV with 4's engine
[0:28:49] <%FrustratedAF> pat you don't even follow red bull esports Kappa
[0:28:49] <%D_day> PAT EXPOSED

[0:55:34] <alrobot2014> if you went to the fort and got the robot army, you can kickstart the endgame so you're pretty far @AngriestPat

[0:55:37] <reddeadwine1277> make her wear the armor of the killers

[0:55:55] <Gruhunchously> Yeah, kind of jumping the gun there, Cass.
[0:55:57] <natebud> What is with this mod? Look at their skin!
[0:55:57] <CircadianRhythmm> does anyone know if gamestop is releasing RE2 a day early or having a midnight release? they did for RDR2 and I'd call but my local one is closed
[0:55:59] <%Kahnicus> Through the criminal justice system of a civilized society!
[0:56:01] <Mr_Strut> Sell her out to the van graffs
[0:56:01] <Kataguro> Yes, drunky. You figured it out. You picked up the incredibly obvious evidence and you put 2 and 2 together
[0:56:01] <Desertfishing> Legal way is for cowards
[0:56:08] <%Fruitywhompus> legal way is for bitch nerds
[0:56:13] <dukenux> fuck it, go on a RAMPAAGE
[0:56:15] <%Kahnicus> Then the Silver Rush is aggro and you have to murder them to shit anyways.
[0:56:20] <dekkitout> this calls for a rampage
[0:56:27] <%ElenaManetta> Have fun with this bullshit quest anything with Van Gruffs is horseshit that only leads to a shoot out
[0:56:28] <Heyestus> R A M P A G E

[0:56:51] <%Kahnicus> Kill Kill Kill Kill Die Die Die
[0:56:51] <%RedMaskBandit> the redbull stuff was funny
[0:56:52] <Gruhunchously> @Kahnicus Yeah, but there tend to come out and fight you in the streets, which is easier than hitting them in the Silver Rush.
[0:56:52] <reddeadwine1277> good point
[0:56:52] <BaronVonDickButt> I did the safe way and when I went back into Freeside the Van Graffs attacked me reguardless
[0:56:52] <%Yum438> Yo, there is a sub discord right?

[0:57:22] <FourLeafLover> @AngriestPat There's a really good reinforce combat armor retexture by Cabal120
[0:57:23] <+IronPickle> Instead of going after the Van Grafs, Maybe we could head over to Bitter Springs and fuck up some refugees
[0:57:23] <reddeadwine1277> Elmo=Therapy
[0:57:25] <Heyestus> Would it be worth it to give her the shotgun you aren't using?
[0:57:25] <natebud> is it finally time to rob the Van Graffs?
[0:57:25] <$ooblagis> Taking away a party member's default clothing seems... wrong

[1:08:10] <$Chimeraelite> Yooooo
[1:08:11] <%ThatGuyfromMars> @Yum438 I'd say after 24 hours
[1:08:12] <%crimsonharvest> In Fallout 2 you can join the slavers guild in the first town and it seems like great deal until later...
[1:08:12] <natebud> You had to save him from being hung
[1:08:12] <%joylent_blue> JOSHUA WOULDA BEEN GREATt
[1:08:14] <captainshtbox> fat NUTS

[1:08:16] <dekkitout> i would love to see that now
[1:08:18] <%rdark_ksu> was bout to say that sounds rad but I like Mormon Josh

[1:08:56] <lizard0tm> I HATE it so much
[1:08:59] <Gorgen> Are there any vaults in Hawaii?
[1:09:00] <WorstCompany> Graham’s getting everyone to hate you in those planning stages is kinda like the reverse of Boone’s anti-Legion effect.
[1:09:02] <+Xalgar> Cook Cook commits evil for funsies. Joshua commits evil for a grander purpose. Chaotic vs. Lawful
[1:09:04] <alrobot2014> RUSSEL
[1:09:04] <%joylent_blue> even with all the burns i would still hit that just because of his voice
[1:09:05] <%ThatGuyfromMars> @Yum438 yeah man, I'm sorry you haven't gotten into the sub discord yet. I was a sub before it was a thing so it was just sitting in my connections tab

[1:43:14] <Shockmaster182> Was yuri spider-man a creep in high school like yosuke?
[1:43:17] <%sparrrow_> what am I looking at
[1:43:19] <$Retrocop87> Is Red Bull going behind Pat's fat back to get cozy with Woolie just NTR?
[1:43:20] <%badchoice5> Remember kids, "Snitches get stitches!" That's right, snitching leads to adequate healthcare!
[1:43:20] <%MrBorisMakarov> GET YOUR COMRADES
[1:43:22] <+zaworldo> did pat turn off the face texture mod?

[1:43:32] <saberknight_> square lady
[1:43:33] <Gruhunchously> It's nice that you can opt out of that part of the quest
[1:43:39] <reddeadwine1277> Pat'll tell errybody
[1:43:40] <brows_> Does everyone in this game have a uncle that is related to every other NPC?
[1:43:41] <%lewdskeletor13> @zaworldo It made people have Whiteface
[1:43:42] <Helveticas> ohio
[1:43:47] <pimpinahz> @circadianrhythmm it's the wasteland. anything goes
[1:43:47] <Kataguro> We know where this is
[1:43:52] <ComradeConquistador> Ohio is shit.
[1:43:53] <SailingSaturn> She looks like she has a mustache cirThink
[1:43:53] <khan99344> @SubjectX07x Voltage is good shit, I just prefer the cherry flavor.
[1:43:57] <%ElenaManetta> This game looks a lot better when I don't look at it and just draw because everytime I turn my head up I get frightened by these models.
[1:43:59] <%ThePuddingDead> wait.....counter feit bottle caps....?
[1:44:05] <%ThePuddingDead> seriously?
[1:44:07] <%kiiiirsten> @ThePuddingDead Yep!
[1:44:10] <%sparrrow_> so do people literally carry around bags of THOUSANDS of bottle caps?
[1:44:11] <austincoffee5000> yep
[1:44:11] <%kujofire990> apatJpeg apatJpeg apatJpeg
[1:44:12] <+KaosMachina> Not counterfeit. New.
[1:44:13] <Krisaeron> The Forbidden Love Triangle: Pat -> Red Bull -> Woolie
[1:44:13] <tonytwotriez> pressing lives matter
[1:44:14] <%Laecerelius> They're not counterfeit, they're new
[1:44:15] <%Jjrossman> how many do you need again?
[1:44:17] <reddeadwine1277> Ohio is in fact currently still shit
[1:44:17] <SubjectX07x> Fair nuff.
[1:44:17] <st_jimmy456> it's almost like using something so easily reproducable as your currency was a mistake
[1:44:18] <%lewdskeletor13> Elena your drawings are awesome!
[1:44:18] <$Brother_Coduss> Well, to be honest, with how many people make Bottle Cap mines having new ones wouldnt be such a problem
[1:44:20] <%MightySuperSoldier> @ThePuddingDead no just new
[1:44:21] <Kataguro> 50 I think
[1:44:22] <dekkitout> but pat, what about the 7 people in chat who want to know why caps are the currency
[1:44:22] <Helveticas> ohayo
[1:44:24] <%Raxus_Secundus> Hmm, wondering about inflation
[1:44:25] <CircadianRhythmm> @pimpinahz lol too true
[1:44:25] <%VRNK> chug all your sarsparilly right now
[1:44:28] <Gruhunchously> @ElenaManetta You'd better draw every single NPC we come across.
[1:44:29] <%Laecerelius> Caps re worth money because they're limited in supply
[1:44:29] <%galaxyswirl> should have grabed those rad sas when you could
[1:44:30] <+Terrachova> is it 'Sasparilla' or 'Sarsaparilla'? Or is this one of those 'Worchester' kind of things?
[1:44:31] <+KaosMachina> Currency only works if there's a limited supply of it and you can't literally just print new ones
[1:44:36] <%kiiiirsten> The place you find them is literally called the counterfeit cap shack so everyone who is saying otherwise form a single file line to figh tme
[1:44:36] <%crimsonharvest> well New California has a fiat currency and Caesar uses gold
[1:44:37] <InsomniacPersona> @AngriestPat Will you Stream Fallout 76 when it goes Free2Play?
[1:44:42] <%ThatGuyfromMars> @Terrachova the second one
[1:44:42] <Helveticas> KonCha
[1:44:43] <Manderfuzz> how do you find out how long Pat's been streaming for?
[1:44:44] <lemonhead996> Man I still cant get over that im living in raccoon city
[1:44:47] <ShichiNoBushi> When was it established that caps would be the standard currency?

[1:45:08] <%rumtumtugnutz> I doubt Pat would stream FO76

[1:45:29] <khan99344> RE 2 Stream later tonight ? Yes ? No ?
[1:45:30] <carlmonte> Is Pat doing late RE2 tomorrow?
[1:45:30] <+StromkoPenguin> I think that F2P rumor might be made up, but it's really obviously going to be true someday soon that FO76 goes F2P or dies.
[1:45:32] <Ariksgabs> D:

[1:45:34] <%SpamKingRathalos> SCORPIONS
[1:45:35] <%Raxus_Secundus> Pat, go press more caps and make them worthless to further prop-up the NCR's efforts to use paper money again

[1:45:41] <%Quigsies> He brought a knife to a gunfight
[1:45:42] <$Brother_Coduss> @AngriestPat it's pronounced Sars-pa-rilla though. the second a is silent
[1:45:42] <Krisaeron> Tunnel Snakes RULE!
[1:45:42] <%GrayMatterMiner> there should be a fallout 76 stream when it goes f2p
[1:45:43] <lemonhead996> RE2 CANT HAPPEN TONIGHT

[2:01:01] <%TheUberknife> ????
[2:01:07] <buffmurffy> tell them you're going to cum A LOT thursday night
[2:01:08] <FunkyStreams> where*
[2:01:12] <%LogothX> Panzer Dragoon was formative for me
[2:01:13] <%OwlLightningMage> You just say that it was a formative experience
[2:01:14] <%HexTone> Thas a good book
[2:01:17] <arcaderabbit48> It is, but it shouldnt be
[2:01:17] <+krawtch> its only a game that has held up for 21 years, being remade and already lauded as being great
[2:01:19] <dekkitout> tell em its a REALLY BIG DEAL
[2:01:20] <$Brother_Coduss> It made you want to kill john lennon
[2:01:20] <pimpinahz> lol that book is shit
[2:01:21] <reddeadwine1277> Goldeneye
[2:01:21] <BakedPretzels> i agree
[2:01:23] <%king_wragles> Oh no! RE2 Came out 45 minutes ago? AND WOOLIE IS ALREADY STREAMING IT?
[2:01:23] <%OwlLightningMage> Agreed Pat
[2:01:24] <%lewdskeletor13> Pat is gonna cum live on stream
[2:01:24] <%ThatGuyfromMars> its even better trying to descibe video games as your first sexual experience
[2:01:25] <alrobot2014> i liked catcher in the rye only because i hated holden caulfield
[2:01:26] <%Rngiddion> i dunno man MGS was a pretty formative piece of media for me
[2:01:27] <%ozzyzak> it's not a great book but when you're a kid ya know?
[2:01:28] <%PlainSimpleTailor> Catcher in the Rye is SUPER overrated
[2:01:29] <baronvonphazon> finally someone that agrees with me about that book
[2:01:30] <%OwlLightningMage> Pat has never been right
[2:01:31] <%rdark_ksu> I liked reading The Jungle in highschool. And i fucking HATED the Scarlet Letter
[2:01:31] <+Feralspirit41> Playing spyro as a kid
[2:01:31] <vicflo1234> Games now a days are just about graphics now a days
[2:01:35] <Migatte_no_Gokui_Yamcha> I still think Beowulf is cool VoHiYo
[2:01:35] <%lucidrush> How do i explain the passage of time to morons
[2:01:36] <ComradeConquistador> Holden Caufield is the worst person ever.
[2:01:36] <+robert_edwards> normies LUL
[2:01:38] <%ElenaManetta> Why did your mom buy it for you
[2:01:39] <%gnarly_memes_bro> The World Ends With You was a life changing time of my life
[2:01:40] <%topendbuzz> and thats why pat is so fucked up
[2:01:41] <Krisaeron> Hyper Love Affair!
[2:01:42] <%SvenHolgersson> Your sister?
[2:01:42] <pimpinahz> lol
[2:01:43] <%CerberusDriver> that memory for me is Mortal Kombat 1.
[2:01:43] <FunkyStreams> Resistance Fall of Man was my first
[2:01:43] <%TheSpiritof2277> The Zapping System?
[2:01:44] <%OwlLightningMage> Never been more right than that
[2:01:44] <%SvenHolgersson> Oh nm
[2:01:45] <+Feralspirit41> Blew my god damn mind and here i am playing all of the games
[2:01:49] <%crimsonharvest> hell yeah videogame is formative, learning how to read well because you played JRPGs
[2:01:50] <FunkyStreams> that owned anyways
[2:01:51] <$Brother_Coduss> ULTRA. VIOLENCE.
[2:01:53] <%Fruitywhompus> god same
[2:01:53] <%DavidSanChan> and having viruses
[2:01:53] <Krisaeron> Hyper Ultra Violence seems a bit excessive
[2:01:55] <natebud> I remember getting THUG2 when I was 12, it was a formative game in my life
[2:01:56] <PSI_Guy95> "I read Catcher in the Rye in high school, and playing Resident Evil 2 really changed my life because Rye fucking sucks"
[2:01:56] <dekkitout> not doom, eh?
[2:01:56] <%FrostMass22> Pat playing RE2 way too young explains a lot
[2:01:56] <Darlington_the_Deceiver> Ultra Violence PogChamp
[2:01:57] <Valentinius_Anodyne> RE2 ruined you, is what you're saying?
[2:01:57] <%GarbageNirvana> When i was a kid I regarded Mortal Kombat with morbid fascination
[2:01:59] <%badchoice5> What do you mean, "Red Bull gave Woolie an early copy of RE2 to stream"!?
[2:02:00] <%Remery_> RE2 made PAt Ultra Violent? :/
[2:02:00] <lemonhead996> Should I get the RE:2 standard or Deluxe ????
[2:02:01] <%lewdskeletor13> ULTIMATE BIOWEAPON
[2:02:02] <+Feralspirit41> Ultra big violence
[2:02:02] <%Raxus_Secundus> Sort of, your peers and those younger than you can definitel6 relate to that
[2:02:02] <%VRNK> you mean überviolence?
[2:02:03] <%ElenaManetta> How did you get away with getting M-rated games as a child I was never able to get away with that as a kid.
[2:02:03] <%marlowe86> Catcher in the Rye does suck.
[2:02:06] <%onlystrykerfan> and attache cases
[2:02:08] <%GarbageNirvana> Never touched until like the PS2 era tho
[2:02:09] <corepercentlives> attache Case hd
[2:02:09] <%Pallion_> Kingdom Hearts changed me
[2:02:10] <%pectusumbra> man you should watch When They Cry
[2:02:10] <%EdgyMacaroon> it made you OCD?
[2:02:11] <reddeadwine1277> Must watch a Clockwork Orange now
[2:02:13] <%mitchteck> And the zap
[2:02:13] <zerocruz> And ZAPPING
[2:02:14] <dukenux> Good ol fashioned ULTRA VIOLENCE
[2:02:16] <Gruhunchously> Talk to Festus and ask him about the long term effects of excessive Sarsaparilla consumption.
[2:02:16] <ComradeConquistador> Ultra Violence is a great Death Angel album.
[2:02:16] <$Chimeraelite> For me it was Shogo
[2:02:17] <%tinyswampthing> mine was probably bioshock
[2:02:18] <%ThatGuyfromMars> @ElenaManetta cool parents
[2:02:21] <+Grayhammatter> the ZAPPING system
[2:02:23] <%Brandon__Brando> I played fallout 3 in middle school it blew my world it made me fall in love with RPGs
[2:02:24] <%lewdskeletor13> ZAPPING
[2:02:24] <dekkitout> why watch clockwork when you can read it
[2:02:24] <+DesertOfSand> My formative game is Marvel Superheroes vs Street Fighter
[2:02:27] <+krawtch> it
[2:02:28] <%cureneckbeard> It's Pat's mind game
[2:02:28] <vicflo1234> What’s everyone’s fav game
[2:02:29] <$Salty3acon> Will you stream it?
[2:02:29] <DragonBornKing> morrowind for me
[2:02:32] <faldin> and now no shitty tank controls
[2:02:34] <%cylish> Lunar and Star Ocean two are pretty much responsible for the games im interested in
[2:02:35] <Worldbrand> I mean nowadays especially I would say that it makes way more sense for an interactive medium to be formative, even though games are still less accepted as art by some
[2:02:36] <%OwlLightningMage> I remember playing FF1 as a child and that being the thing that got me into RPGs
[2:02:36] <%knoxxsgold> I played Majora's Mask when I was like 6, pretty sure it scarred me for life when the moon first crashed.
[2:02:38] <GarbageQueenEllie> The protagonist in Catcher in the Rye is a total fuckboi. Not very inspiring
[2:02:39] <Davion_Salkovich> @Brandon__Brando jesus i was in college when that came out
[2:02:40] <Ayru_> will you look at all the bricks?
[2:02:40] <Inebriateddonut> Wait if you like inventory management why did Subnautica give you such a big problem?
[2:02:41] <sukiyakiwestern> narrate playing in your hesd right now
[2:02:43] <%valriot> It seems ALOT more updated
[2:02:43] <OToole42> final fantasy 6
[2:02:44] <arcaderabbit48> A little basic, but Pokemon Yellow is very much the reason Im such a whore for RPGs now.
[2:02:45] <%ThatRandomGuy661> @AngriestPat when you'd play it in your head is it perfect runs or do you still fuck up?
[2:02:45] <%Big_Dream> Legend of Dragoon is my favoirte rpg
[2:02:46] <Mr_Strut> Why does Pat even need a remake when he can just play an imaginary version?
[2:02:46] <%FrostMass22> @lemonhead996 The only worthwhile change I've seen is toggling for the original soundtrack
[2:02:47] <+InugamiTheHound> metal gear solid 2 changed my life. It made distrust the our current government and also hate war and nuclear weapons
[2:02:48] <faldin> LUL
[2:02:48] <%Rngiddion> the only game on the PS1 that I remember playing was Metal Gear Solid and I can run that game in my head like you do RE2
[2:02:49] <GallivantingKiwi> LUL
[2:02:49] <%tinyswampthing> i played alot of games before that but that game means alot to me
[2:02:49] <%VRNK> MISS PAIGE
[2:02:51] <+krawtch> it'll be the first time in about 18 years that I havent known literally every single thing about RE2
[2:02:51] <corepercentlives> lobosLULN
[2:02:51] <%PlainSimpleTailor> It is NOT just another zombie game
[2:02:53] <%MrBorisMakarov> MISS PAIGE
[2:02:53] <starotter70> YEAH
[2:02:53] <stardustno1r> Yeah, i get it, in my case it was Oblvion. Hope that gets remastered someday.
[2:02:54] <ScreamingMeat> I can't remember what my first violent video game was
[2:02:55] <%MrBorisMakarov> I SAW THAT
[2:02:58] <krymzen5> my local gamestops dropping it at 6pm tom, and i'm way too hyped
[2:02:59] <Krisaeron> As a Kid I started out with Silent Hill and Alone in The Dark. The second game got me pretty jumpy at shadows and everything dark, but also I now have a fondness for it, since I had to deal with it the hard way. @AngriestPat
[2:03:00] <FunkyStreams> thats pretty amazing that a entire part of your brain is dedicated to remembering each individual aspect of that game, enough so to form a mental projection of it.
[2:03:00] <%VRNK> you broke into paige's COMPUTER
[2:03:01] <+SWFanatic> I'd like to control your tank
[2:03:02] <%Raxus_Secundus> Has Pat already addressed the IGN review snafu??
[2:03:03] <Naho_Saenoki> Mega Man X4 is the game I play in my head. It was among my first PS1 games, and I still have the scratched, non-functioning disc.
[2:03:03] <Carloscjq> any plans on trying the new California mod?
[2:03:03] <%joylent_blue> MISS PAIGE
[2:03:03] <PSI_Guy95> Persona 4 was a formative game for me but now I can't stand it
[2:03:06] <attractdistract> MISS PAIGE
[2:03:06] <reddeadwine1277> all those deaths were for Nothing!
[2:03:06] <%BoboDaHobo> Catcher In The Rye made me realize that my moody depressive state was just being seen as me being an asshole to everyone around me.
[2:03:06] <Parapattern> Whenever I visit my dad and he sees me playing older video games, he always asks "Why would you play a game with old graphics?"
[2:03:10] <lizard0tm> @angriestpat Make sure you get a Redbull shirt for maximum shill on next podcast
[2:03:14] <buffmurffy> what i want to see is a remake of RE4 with tank controls and fixed camera angles
[2:03:14] <marrowjuice> skyrim/new vegas got me into roleplaying
[2:03:14] <%ElenaManetta> Yeah that bullshit with the FIVE GOLDEN BOTTLECAPS
[2:03:17] <Huntercd> Where is Paige?
[2:03:22] <Darlington_the_Deceiver> PAIGE.EXE NOT FOUND
[2:03:22] <jobbedbone> do you just like tank controls as a side effect of loving RE2 or did they help to make it great?
[2:03:23] <%AmaniIsYourBoss> Remake still doesn't play like the superior RE 2 remake that is Darkside Chronicles, 0/10 Crapcom Kappa
[2:03:24] <%Brandon__Brando> civilization and paradox strategy games actually got me super interested into history
[2:03:24] <$HentaiSenpai9K> Leon is a girl and you play as him
[2:03:25] <dukenux> Its a publicity stunt
[2:03:25] <+CaptainYuYu> eating raisin bran watching angriestpat
[2:03:26] <ScreamingMeat> And all you got was a shiity badge and a story
[2:03:27] <%joylent_blue> the employee name on the computer was Miss Paige
[2:03:27] <%CerberusDriver> Or just play RE4 with the DMC3 mod
[2:03:30] <%Das_Bass> I can play MGS1 in my head. I played it like 20+ times @AngriestPat
[2:03:31] <alrobot2014> its like the mcdonalds competition
[2:03:31] <+CaptainYuYu> aww yeah its a wednesday
[2:03:32] <%lewdskeletor13> Paige is dead
[2:03:34] <%ECRead> the plebeians shall soon know about the RE2
[2:03:37] <vicflo1234> I played this so much on my ps3
[2:03:42] <DonatelloJose> Welcome miss Paige
[2:03:42] <+TransporterX7> oh no Star Ocean 2 got me into RPG's I'm OLLLLD
[2:03:42] <Gruhunchously> @Parapattern Ask him why he would ever watch an old movie with outdated special effects.
[2:03:42] <%ThatGuyfromMars> same
[2:03:43] <tacostarvedbeast> Pat u nerd
[2:03:43] <dukenux> Sass Co forgot to turn it off
[2:03:44] <%OwlLightningMage> Paige is getting her back fixed
[2:03:45] <+Swaggamanca> This quest was funny but it has lost potential
[2:03:46] <reddeadwine1277> Paige is looking for Star Caps
[2:03:46] <starotter70> Quickly find her porn
[2:03:48] <WorstCompany> @angriestpat what would you do if somehow, miraculously, RE2 shits the bed entirely?
[2:03:48] <Migatte_no_Gokui_Yamcha> I used to think FFX was related to MMX and wondered when I could switch from Tidus to X :(
[2:03:50] <%AncelDeLambert> Festus
[2:03:52] <krymzen5> i can play re4 in my head, and DMC1
[2:03:53] <%Slaardacity> Mine was kingdom hearts so were in the same boat kinda lol
[2:03:54] <%FrostMass22> I'm able to play some of Dark Souls in my head
[2:03:54] <$Brother_Coduss> @AngriestPat that;s the bottle cap door

[2:16:36] <Krisaeron> Like 2k people are now watching Pat stumble fumble and bullshit his way with cheats, glitches, the wiki, with chat help though Fallout: New Vegas. He has the most bullshit build with critical hits and rifles so no one can come close to him and he can shoot them in the head, he has mods that allow for easy hacking and lockpicking, and yet still people are watching and enjoying the stream because of how silly and entertaining it is to watch a big bald man fumble through games and get his soul shat
[2:16:36] <%badchoice5> Since I'm subbed does that mean Pat is sponsored by me?
[2:16:37] <Alien3isTopTier> LootDonalds, Legendary Nuggets.

[2:23:43] <%cureneckbeard> elmo
[2:23:44] <StormShaun> Which one is more edible?
[2:23:44] <Kemmybelle> Elmo would let you both drown though.
[2:23:46] <%ozzyzak> watch pat ho down
[2:23:47] <%lewdskeletor13> I CLAPPES
[2:23:47] <Heyestus> I thought Paige's condition meant she dissolved if she came into contact with water
[2:23:48] <reiju_22> red bull complaining about woolies followers when he has the same followers as pat Kappa
[2:23:51] <%Remery_> Watch Pat go down <3
[2:23:52] <Glitterplague> neither, can't get your feetsies wet, that is how you get a cold.
[2:23:53] <Hellarussian> is Elmo short for Elmort?
[2:23:54] <C_S_N_G> Save Elmo and tell Paige to just float
[2:23:55] <InkyDraconian> pat sexier sa skeloton

[2:23:56] <Bouldus> WHO SAID THAT

[2:23:57] <$Chimeraelite> Wait...
[2:23:58] <%badchoice5> With the energy from delicious Red Bull, they could both swim easily to safety!
[2:23:58] <dekkitout> im sure pat naturally floats
[2:23:59] <tacostarvedbeast> @angriestpat Elmo, then yourself, then Paige’s boots, THEN Paige
[2:24:00] <%Lillowh> Pat doesn't go down confirmed
[2:24:01] <%BlitzNeidhart> Tbf, Elmo would need saving if he goes near water
[2:24:04] <Lolcola34> Eat Elmo save Paige regurgitate Elmo.
[2:24:04] <ScreamingMeat> Pat's anger would just vaporize the water
[2:24:04] <Archmortal> Save Paige, rip out her hair and use it to lasso Elmo who will try to eat it, allowing you to pull him in
[2:24:06] <+pl0xzz> BIG STRONG
[2:24:07] <%flagi64> but what about Jpeg Dog?
[2:24:07] <Gruhunchously> Some companions used to be bangable but it was cut because Chris Avellone is a weird alien man.
[2:24:09] <StormShaun> Whenever you're in a situation where you have to save someone, always save the one that you can eat more.
[2:24:09] <PSI_Guy95> Yee haw
[2:24:11] <%Thatghostpepper> well we just need paige to get free mustard from her fav company
[2:24:12] <%Ciphris> let's be real the lupus would claim paige before pat could even dream of saving her

[2:24:15] <+Nomicro4u> You need to feed Elmo more so he become bouyant
[2:24:16] <%ElenaManetta> Pat doesn't even need to TRY to save Paige because she would get out of the water as fast as she can because she hates the water.
[2:24:16] <GarbageQueenEllie> Mmkay

[3:08:11] <%Laecerelius> The murder is not nearly as bad as saying that we're probably bad people
[3:08:11] <%ThatRandomGuy661> Fallout 2077 actually works tho
[3:08:12] <Inebriateddonut> Is it only subscribers?
