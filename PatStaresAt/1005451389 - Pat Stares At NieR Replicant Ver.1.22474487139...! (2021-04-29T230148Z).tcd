[0:14:46] <CheesesSliced> "Would you like some cheese?"
[0:14:47] <%rumtumtugnutz> Crackers love cheese.
[0:14:47] <chimeraxmachina> The entire plot of boxtrolls as well
[0:14:47] <ahmenthi> cheese is best
[0:14:48] <+FoolsArcade> I am white, I do not care for the cheese

[0:14:52] <%Jay_Squirrel> he even had that fancy velvetta
[0:14:52] <pixelkenj> mutually exclusive
[0:14:53] <%Monkeyweed21> white man turns into Mr. Rogers if you give him some cheese
[0:14:54] <%RigmaroleHM> I DO love cheese
[0:14:54] <%Carquar> As a white person living in Wisconsin, this is fact.
[0:14:54] <+UltimateVersus> It's in my veins as an European dude
[0:14:54] <Boegame> Fascinate a woman with a piece of cheese
[0:14:54] <wolfen091> its pat choese at
[0:14:57] <%RigmaroleHM> Cheese on everything
[0:14:58] <%JoshManVGH> That's why Andrew Jackson was given a Giant Cheese Wheele

[0:15:02] <%ZizerX> choese is fantastic
[0:15:03] <%torusendor> It's different
[0:15:04] <%maybefalco> cheese is fucking awesome
[0:15:05] <%Monkeyweed21> NOT BY ITSELF
[0:15:05] <pixelkenj> *american* cheese
[0:15:06] <%za7az> I can confirm as a white person that cheese is the cheese
[0:15:06] <bob900000> I like cheese 🧀
[0:15:07] <zenith0111> Not enough to just eat cheese
[0:15:08] <$saladin1911> cheese is fine
[0:15:10] <%BettyMwwaahh> you would say that, Whitey
[0:15:11] <iosephe> Cheese is good but you can't bait me like a mouse with it
[0:15:11] <%emperordread> The inexplicably cheese obsessed race of ham sandwich
[0:15:12] <%Maids4lyfe> I have friends who are most certainly not white and they like cheese
[0:15:15] <BlackStarAura> I'm a cheese whore
[0:15:17] <Clanes> I like certain cheeses, but I'm only half white, so I can't say for sure
[0:15:19] <thelonechris> Cheese is basically spoiled milk that someone decided to eat
[0:15:19] <ken_masters_son_of_sparda> I'm black and I'll do anything for cheese
[0:15:20] <%RigmaroleHM> I love babybel
[0:15:20] <%ClericOfSparda> Choese
[0:15:21] <%BoxNavy> it is good on its own
[0:15:21] <+UltimateVersus> F*ck yeah
[0:15:21] <Psyramics> "i know you're trying to butter me up for something but I don't care" and then stuff your mouth with cheese

[0:15:24] <+JustToWatch> FRESH MOZZERELLA IS GOD TIER
[0:15:24] <OswaldTheDog> Cheese rules man
[0:15:25] <PanicSwytch> ME TOO
[0:15:26] <SilverFaustX> glutton
[0:15:26] <%linSP> Cheese smells like feet therefore you like feet
[0:15:26] <%rumtumtugnutz> Cheese is best by itseld
[0:15:27] <%SunnyVarietyPack> I'll eat some cheddar like an apple
[0:15:29] <%OfficioPrefectusCorgi> Do it now
[0:15:29] <+UltimateVersus> I eat brie without anything
[0:15:29] <$saladin1911> eww wtf
[0:15:32] <CheesesSliced> Take it from me, everyone loves Cheeses
[0:15:33] <%unlocked2886> Hell yeah brie
[0:15:34] <%rumtumtugnutz> *cheese is best by itself
[0:15:34] <%xMaSterKeef420bluntNinjAx> I eat like 6 string cheeses a day
[0:15:35] <%Mr_Pylon> Big slices of cheddar, some wine, great
[0:15:35] <fatalDestiny> That's disgusting, but I respect it.
[0:15:35] <+chase959> also episode one of undergrads about cheese
[0:15:35] <wolfen091> pat, you wore those fishnets yesterday
[0:15:35] <%Monkeyweed21> thats so white
[0:15:36] <%AyotoCorp> Paige "Just give me the ham" Saliva was pissed off?
[0:15:36] <+mans51> well like 68% of the world population can't handle cheese
[0:15:36] <%ringabal> THIS IS JUST MUFFINS 2.0
[0:15:37] <+UltimateVersus> and its glorious
[0:15:38] <+trizetacannon44> Non-white people are more likely lactose intolerant then white people.
[0:15:38] <pixelkenj> bite a big chunk into a wheel
[0:15:38] <%Ynkubus_> LUL
[0:15:38] <%miguelrod777> you people are rats why would you eat the whole blocks
[0:15:40] <SilverFaustX> D:
[0:15:41] <muddiestpath> are you my mum?
[0:15:42] <CheesesSliced> Cheeses loves you
[0:15:42] <%OrangeMDT> I’m a non-white and I hate cheese by itself
[0:15:43] <Flame_Water> youre not canadian if you havnt eaten a block of chese
[0:15:43] <%JoshManVGH> Isnt Brie super spreadable cheese?
[0:15:47] <zenith0111> White people problems LUL
[0:15:48] <%spitelite> prove it coward
[0:15:48] <%czeekytv> Oh that makes more sense than Paige judging you for weird eating habits
[0:15:49] <+AnthonyJMax> pat is wallace confirmed
[0:15:50] <%walternatorz> I roomed with a guy who ate cheese by the block with his special cutting board
[0:15:50] <OswaldTheDog> Just....like an apple???
[0:15:50] <+UltimateVersus> you aint taking away my brie
[0:15:51] <%saadi90> Choese
[0:15:53] <filialpails> it's because people who descend from northern and nomadic populations don't develop lactose intolerance in adulthood
[0:15:53] <marvel877> Remember when Arsenio Hall was at a fancy party and was mad nobody told him how good the cheese was?
[0:15:56] <+oktavia_von> im not white and love cheese was there a memo that i missed?
[0:15:56] <kikoeru_san> I've eaten an apple while eating cheddar like an apple
[0:15:57] <+UltimateVersus> i will bite a hand off
[0:15:59] <%Garthunox> last time i ate a block of cheese i was on the toilet all next day
[0:16:00] <%JoshManVGH> Ah!
[0:16:03] <Byorski> Pat performs action.  Paige gets mad.  A tale as old as time.
[0:16:04] <CheesesSliced> Accept the love of Cheeses
[0:16:06] <yourliteraldog> Cheese has a pronounced calming effect on white peopl, it is quite scary having witnessed it irl.
[0:16:06] <@PeachSaliva> It’s true I’ve seen it :(
[0:16:06] <+BIumen> choese
[0:16:06] <%RetroCop87> feta is good for salad
[0:16:08] <%king_wragles> Why did you put the brie in the fridge?!
[0:16:12] <%Aeoneth> Pat I would not use Paige as a meter stick of sanity
[0:16:14] <%rumtumtugnutz> You know what is gnarly though is that Quebec cheese
[0:16:17] <%PocketBearIllustrator> Pizza with cheese is amazing, but boy, is it unhealthy. :P
[0:16:19] <+JustToWatch> by cold do you mean frozen?
[0:16:19] <CheesesSliced> Do you accept Cheeses into your heart?
[0:16:19] <+chase959> like a skyrim amount of cheese
[0:16:20] <ken_masters_son_of_sparda> i had some cheese before the stream
[0:16:20] <$saladin1911> @peachsaliva my condolences
[0:16:21] <%unlocked2886> Also it's bullshit that I can't redeem prime subs on anything but a desk/laptop. It's cool though, have some Amazon monies @PatStaresAt
[0:16:21] <pixelkenj> what cheeses do you avoid :)
[0:16:22] <%king_wragles> @PeachSaliva Hello today!

[0:17:46] <%Ranryu692> I know you're talking about Beselgeuse or however it's spelled, but i'd like to imagine it was the Goose from Untitled Goose Game
[0:17:49] <%BoxNavy> 4Head
[0:17:50] <wolfen091> HARDCORE TO THE MEGA
[0:17:52] <%JoshManVGH> He becomes such a big dork once you know the fight.

[0:18:21] <+UltimateVersus> You playing 13 sentinels Pat?
[0:18:22] <pixelkenj> have you gotten any fun loading screens?
[0:18:23] <%walternatorz> suuuuuuuure
[0:18:27] <+RyTYoung> oops
[0:18:30] <thelonechris> "I did some grinding off screen."
[0:18:35] <jcflyguy> "So I grinded off sceen"
[0:18:36] <%RoboticAnimeDude> HOW MUCH TIME SPENT OFFSCREEN GRINDING
[0:18:39] <%ringabal> okay, I believe you
[0:18:40] <+Kindan55> Lie, we know you grinded off stream
[0:18:45] <+JustToWatch> @UltimateVersus he beat it months ago
[0:18:46] <morow1ec> grinding off stream again smh
[0:18:49] <%Aeogard> did you do every sidequest now
[0:18:50] <+UltimateVersus> "17 hours"
[0:18:50] <%RetroCop87> @PatStaresAt have you tried the Automata outfits yet?
[0:18:50] <Tonicky > Just got ending E. Great game
[0:18:56] <%walternatorz> You're lucky you were level 100 or some shit
[0:19:03] <%czeekytv> 19 minutes to game time, not bad
[0:19:06] <+UltimateVersus> @JustToWatch I saw it was played recently
[0:19:11] <cardamomo88> GOGO
[0:19:12] <zenith0111> THIS IS A BIG GRIND
[0:19:19] <+D00msDayDan> farm the pink moonflower on-screen coward
[0:19:19] <+UltimateVersus> On his PS5 menu
[0:19:20] <CheesesSliced> Can someone please make a Patgrind gif?
[0:19:21] <+MelodyMedley> Getting that 15 hour achivement was tough...
[0:19:25] <zenith0111> You got the farm? LUL
[0:19:25] <Ethel9727> Not really, C/D just requires getting all weapons not upgradding them
[0:19:25] <Tonicky > Yeah so much grind lol
[0:19:26] <Paranoid_Jumbotron> no you dont, the multiple playthroughs give you more than enough money for the weapons
[0:19:30] <Ninoace> The biggest grind
[0:19:30] <pixelkenj> and then sometimes you dont get what you need on a grinding trip :)
[0:19:32] <%PocketBearIllustrator> So... Papa NieR or Brother Nier?
[0:19:33] <+nebula_lp> do you? what for?
[0:19:34] <jcflyguy> D is acquiring, not upgrading
[0:19:36] <%Aeogard> @PatStaresAt Will you do the old DLC (Recycled Vessel) on stream too? or off screen?
[0:19:37] <zenith0111> I got my pink moonflowers thank god
[0:19:41] <pixelkenj> .........
[0:19:42] <BouzenJishitsu> grinding and GARDENING :D
[0:19:47] <+nebula_lp> getting all the weapons was pretty easy
[0:19:48] <%cvp5127> LUL
[0:19:49] <Boegame> doggo NOOO
[0:19:51] <%TIME_PUNCHER> huh, NieR is just Rein spelt backwards
[0:19:52] <%RoboticAnimeDude> yeah i just finished everything with over 50 hours. long stretches of grind
[0:19:53] <+UltimateVersus> Is it worth playing the old nier game?
[0:19:56] <+BoboDaHobo> you really don't though
[0:19:58] <cardamomo88> LUL
[0:20:05] <Ethel9727> The only really annoying one is iirc one requires 3 rare drops from somewhere (Junk Heap I think?) but in the process of getting that youu get enough stuff to sell to buy the rest
[0:20:05] <+PkSilent01> @Aeogard He has to do it, two weapons are locked behind it to unlock ending D
[0:20:11] <OswaldTheDog> poor puppies
[0:20:17] <yourliteraldog> boi
[0:20:19] <zenith0111> @jcflyguy All weapons come with lore you cant read without maxing out so its kinda wanted by a lot lol
[0:20:22] <+Kindan55> You hear that Tucker Carlson!?
[0:20:26] <pixelkenj> amazing
[0:20:28] <OswaldTheDog> baby nier is such a good kid
[0:20:32] <%swesterly> Has Pat gotten to the part in DE where he learns about Pale? If so when did that part happen?
[0:20:34] <Paranoid_Jumbotron> @Aeogard 3 actually, but you dont have to beat the final part
[0:20:34] <%Aeogard> @PkSilent01 Oh of course, I just didnt know if he'll show us doing it or not on stream :p
[0:20:36] <pixelkenj> did you get the line where nier says he cant swim
[0:20:37] <%Ranryu692> alright, I'm off to Elysium. Have fun!
[0:20:40] <%SunnyVarietyPack> i was genuinely suprised to learn that boy near is 16
[0:20:43] <%czeekytv> @UltimateVersus If you have easy access to it.... maybe. But with this remake being so faithful to the original Replicant version, I'd say you're not missing out on much besides Papa Nier
[0:20:43] <zenith0111> Nice
[0:20:43] <%TIME_PUNCHER> Stream over I guess
[0:20:45] <+PkSilent01> @Ethel9727 The one in which you need to get Memory Alloy, Titanium Alloy, and Machine Oil
[0:20:48] <BouzenJishitsu> well if you KNOW which sidequests you dont need makes it a lot easier
[0:20:52] <twohitgood> did you beat all 5 fish tiers?
[0:20:52] <%Maids4lyfe> LUL
[0:20:53] <pixelkenj> 50 SARDINES
[0:20:57] <VidulaSaix> F I S H
[0:21:02] <%RoboticAnimeDude> lol
[0:21:03] <Byorski> Here's the best ending!
[0:21:04] <pixelkenj> yes
[0:21:07] <%torusendor> It rules
[0:21:08] <zenith0111> Wtf is that hitbox???
[0:21:09] <Ninoace> fishies
[0:21:09] <+RyTYoung> Where do you catch "the one" and is it just with a lure?
[0:21:11] <Ethel9727> This sword is infused with the power of anime
[0:21:14] <tattleworm> somebody liked automata's shockwave chip
[0:21:14] <cardamomo88> SabaPing SabaPing
[0:21:14] <%Monkeyweed21> @PatStaresAt hows your garden coming along
[0:21:18] <ExpressNode> I might get this game but since there are golden weeks sales on every platform right now
[0:21:20] <%Aeogard> >yorha weapon  :/ NO MAGIC BONUS
[0:21:20] <+PkSilent01> But when timeskip starts it PHEONIX SPEAR TIME BABY
[0:21:20] <+D00msDayDan> it's got the shockwave chip from automata
[0:21:21] <mr_saturday93> Howd you upgrade it so quickly?
[0:21:25] <zenith0111> Not even in Automata is it that big
[0:21:29] <+UltimateVersus> @UltimateVersus thanks man, I'll play this one instead then
[0:21:33] <zenith0111> RIP SIDEQUEST
[0:21:35] <devanmuse> Have you tried the Automata DLC? How's the alternate voice cast?
[0:21:35] <+MelodyMedley> Very busted
[0:21:36] <%RoboticAnimeDude> until phoenix spear which is still broken
[0:21:37] <pixelkenj> you better start planting moonflowers for a later quest
[0:21:37] <+D00msDayDan> but da moonflowers
[0:21:39] <+Rawowner333> is the sword a preorder bonus?
[0:21:42] <%RetroCop87> I maxed the Facade weapon the instant I left Facade without trying
[0:21:43] <jcflyguy> Upgrading it requires fishing and fishing sucks
[0:21:46] <%torusendor> @PatStaresAt Cruel Oath level buffs magic
[0:21:52] <mycoldshoulder> Phoenix spear is busted
[0:21:52] <%torusendor> Level 4
[0:21:53] <yourliteraldog> Whats the lore attached to it
[0:21:53] <%PocketBearIllustrator> I love Devola's version of Song of the Ancients here.
[0:21:55] <+D00msDayDan> @Rawowner333 automata content is free dlc
[0:21:58] <mr_saturday93> you need to fish tha part?
[0:21:58] <+MelodyMedley> No gardening for Pat
[0:22:10] <pixelkenj> Did you get the funny Yonah Diary entry?

[0:22:27] <Zayasu> why is the music fucked up for me ResidentSleeper
[0:22:30] <%Monkeyweed21> sweet medicinal fish
[0:22:30] <%czeekytv> Is the Automata content PS4/PS5 only? Not seeing it on the Steam version
[0:22:32] <+UltimateVersus> have fun guys, going to sleep
[0:22:32] <+Rawowner333> @Rawowner333 thank you. i somehow missed it i gues
[0:22:32] <%TIME_PUNCHER> This kinda looks like a prettied-up PS3 game, not that that's bad
[0:22:33] <zenith0111> The earlier you start farming the better for anyone who wants to responsibly do it without manipulating your console
[0:22:33] <%BoxNavy> yay :)
[0:22:34] <%RetroCop87> If you revisit the Facade palace, you interupt the Prince while he's pulling moves on Fyra
[0:22:35] <%BettyMwwaahh> soft spoken anime girl
[0:22:36] <pixelkenj> yayyyy
[0:22:36] <twohitgood> it's the most meak "yay" ever.

[0:26:10] <Ninoace> the side quests are garbo
[0:26:15] <heartlesshealer> =)
[0:26:17] <%Aeogard> at least part A sidequests don't have anything important other than lore
[0:26:19] <%ringabal> The genuine Nier experience
[0:26:22] <%torusendor> Old Lady
[0:26:23] <Decsta> the back and forth is so ass

[0:26:25] <%Monkeyweed21> Yonah has a quest @PatStaresAt
[0:26:25] <%linSP> FISHING
[0:26:26] <zenith0111> The side quests are straight up Animal Crossing at times
[0:26:26] <spongeofmystery> Weren't they put in specifically because Taro hates completionists?
[0:26:26] <pixelkenj> Its shocking how fast you go through the game if you ignore sidequests
[0:26:26] <fairore> what up pat
[0:26:26] <VidulaSaix> The pre adult has some real shitters for sure
[0:26:27] <+Caidezes> Lighthouse lady tho.

[0:26:31] <heartlesshealer> grandma lighthouse is good
[0:26:31] <+nikoloas_> all of them :)
[0:26:32] <%athuramn> good evening err body

[0:26:36] <dinnydanny777> This is peak 2008 sidequests
[0:26:39] <+Kindan55> The lost daughter one in facade is good
[0:26:41] <pixelkenj> rip deer
[0:26:43] <Blank9> almost all pre-timeskip ones are terrible and have no good rewards because they don't want them skippable
[0:26:46] <%ZizerX> Big damage
[0:26:49] <zenith0111> YE YE YE
[0:26:49] <yourliteraldog> Blood Gohst
[0:26:50] <%BoxNavy> yooooo
[0:26:52] <Blank9> or missable I guess
[0:26:56] <%torusendor> Junk Heap quests are easy and have good dialog
[0:26:58] <%linSP> big number
[0:26:59] <Paranoid_Jumbotron> god the parry is so good in this game
[0:27:04] <%BoxNavy> you were cool
[0:27:04] <%Agami23> theres one that really confused me in facade
[0:27:05] <BOOOOOBIE> Every side quest is a fetchquest like every single one
[0:27:09] <%stickygumbolee> Pat's hitting that Yakuza Kiwami malaise
[0:27:12] <tattleworm> kainé did a victory jump
[0:27:14] <%athuramn> is he talking about how boring some of the side quests are? this is what I meant when I said Liam spared you a lot of pain lol
[0:27:15] <Blank9> fishing is a good sidequest
[0:27:18] <%Bailey__gaming> Bailey__gaming subscribed with Prime. They've subscribed for 18 months! 18 months yay glad to hear that returnal is getting good reviews cant wait to see it in action, hope you and Peaches are doing well

[0:27:20] <+StatesmanPrimal> post time skip or junk heap are the ones to look out for
[0:27:25] <%torusendor> Forest of Myth Sidequest is good
[0:27:26] <%czeekytv> @BOOOOOBIE one is a fragile delivery :>
[0:27:26] <zenith0111> @blank9 They placed in ways so you know where rare spawn points are and get used to finding different enemy patterns cia location you enter from
[0:27:27] <%ringabal> @PatStaresAt Wait , you have Kaine? Did I miss a stream?
[0:27:28] <Paranoid_Jumbotron> @BOOOOOBIE not true, there are some that require you to kill an overworld boss
[0:27:29] <heartlesshealer> but for real lighthouse lady is good if you haven't already
[0:27:29] <%RetroCop87> I stopped using the Automata weapons since it became too easy
[0:27:32] <Decsta> shoutout to the one that's in Seafront but they're like "go to the village" but then it's "go to seafront" like 3 times
[0:27:36] <SPARDA990> Pat is German Correct
[0:27:39] <LordOfThePoultry> the only thing wrong with this game is that it doesn't have damage numbers
[0:27:40] <+StatesmanPrimal> oh yeah and forest of myth
[0:28:00] <%Monkeyweed21> @PatStaresAt make sure to do all of Yonah's quests
[0:28:00] <%linSP> pat is francois
[0:28:02] <%RetroCop87> close nuff
[0:28:04] <%BoxNavy> yeah but what if you were german
[0:28:04] <+mans51> thought you were canadian
[0:28:06] <dinnydanny777> That's worse limesYikes
[0:28:08] <+Rawowner333> this isn't forest of myth
[0:28:08] <Blank9> Oh, the forest of myth sidequest is good too, I think you can do it pre-timeskip to get Faith early.
[0:28:08] <+ALazo> Don't confuse pat for a german spy
[0:28:14] <caramix7> Ostie de calice que c'est pas pareil tiens
[0:28:20] <%TIME_PUNCHER> France is just the Germany of Canada @patstaresat
[0:28:22] <spongeofmystery> Pat you are French-lite limesHmm
[0:28:24] <zenith0111> But most side quests have a over arching narrative that carry through the time skip
[0:28:25] <%RoboticAnimeDude> little french boi
[0:28:27] <+StatesmanPrimal> I thought pat was from Saturn's moon Titan?
[0:28:27] <yourliteraldog> Quebec The Red Neck French

[0:28:32] <FoxInABeret> "It's called a 'roofie.'"
[0:28:33] <%torusendor> This is a good sidequest

[0:31:45] <%Dakuu75> LOL
[0:31:48] <%BoxNavy> moon2W
[0:31:49] <+SleepDeprived42> Retro means "in the style of something from the past". PS2 isn't retro. It's just old school.

[0:33:07] <KaiserMario> I feel like you can't call the PS2 retro when we are still getting re-releases for RE4
[0:33:12] <%ssjklyco> It should be
[0:33:14] <OswaldTheDog> man this is such a perfect game to watch while sewing

[0:34:53] <thevoiceofcheese> She’s a hoe fosho
[0:34:54] <%cvp5127> check the mailman
[0:34:54] <+Caidezes> Talk to Devola for the quest.
[0:34:54] <%RetroCop87> devola gives you the old lady quest
[0:34:59] <tattleworm> some of the lighthouse lady quests start at the post office, maybe try there
[0:34:59] <fairore> @mans51 yes it is
[0:35:01] <%linSP> diavolo gave me the old lady quest
[0:35:02] <twohitgood> old lady was after the shaman fish, isn't it?
[0:35:03] <zenith0111> @solracc25 Whos making new ps2 consoles?
[0:35:04] <yourliteraldog> Have also found trash lad I recommend
[0:35:05] <%BoxNavy> thats for idiots
[0:35:10] <twohitgood> then it's the post office
[0:35:15] <ahmenthi> but there's plastic covered in meat juice and banana peels in my trash, no ladies :(
[0:35:15] <+Kindan55> Its devola
[0:35:18] <+StatesmanPrimal> ye diavolo LUL
[0:35:20] <pixelkenj> Then probably have to do some story
[0:35:22] <+cade_calrayn> I think you get an intro cinematic when you first show up to Seafront involving the old lady, don't you?
[0:35:23] <CappuccinoGuil> @Monkeyweed21 you fool! he's already a tier 3. He's aiming for a tier FIVE sub.
[0:35:23] <+D00msDayDan> it starts at the post office but you need to pick up the quest from devola first
[0:35:23] <%Agami23> weiss's voice was so cool back in the day to me, now i cant hear anything but caleb from critical role
[0:35:25] <+mans51> thought I recognized him
[0:35:26] <Louie_Salmon> I think it might need an area reload
[0:35:26] <%Monkeyweed21> @PatStaresAt Yonah had a quest make sure you do all her stuff
[0:35:27] <+mikesapartment> go inside the post office to trigger it
[0:35:27] <zenith0111> Popola procs the side quests sometimes
[0:35:27] <boardscanada> I think the ferryman with the red bag is new stuff
[0:35:30] <%ssjklyco> I think Devola tells you to go to the post office to start it
[0:35:37] <%linSP> mr popo
[0:35:38] <OswaldTheDog> How do you find a trash lady if you’re already a trash lady?

[0:38:16] <%SveriSageAdvice> Pat we can hear discord pinging
[0:38:16] <%rumtumtugnutz> I think in Video game terms, PS2 is definitely old enough to be retro.

[0:38:30] <%Agami23> i started checking everything to see where the discord notifications were coming from
[0:38:36] <%rumtumtugnutz> I think PS3 might technically be far enough removed to be considered retro now.

[0:47:40] <%Dakuu75> @Kindan55 no one quests a floating book either. *shrugs*
[0:47:42] <%BoxNavy> yeah keep playing
[0:47:47] <pixelkenj> the game: PLEASE keep playing
[0:47:48] <%Dakuu75> questions*
[0:47:52] <mycoldshoulder> I like that quest completion noise tho
[0:47:53] <%linSP> the credits means chapter 1 complete
[0:47:56] <$realm_forge> Their version of the WAP song is heavenly
[0:47:58] <%WhereIsWill> psaBig facts
[0:48:00] <+StatesmanPrimal> it's VERY clear when you're done
[0:48:01] <KaitlynnHere> No
[0:48:03] <CriscoKnight> Is there some kind of upgrade for 1.22 on PS5?
[0:48:12] <CappuccinoGuil> That you're "finished"
[0:48:13] <%SunnyVarietyPack> apparently not with replicantr
[0:48:15] <experience_share> Finished this remake last night, really loved it, and started an immediate replay of Automata
[0:48:18] <%solracc25> Pig
[0:48:18] <dinnydanny777> Unless it's Drakengard, in which case stop for your own sanity
[0:48:24] <iosephe> You're only done when you're asked to delete your save
[0:48:25] <+acridpaladin> 1.22 IS the upgrade.
[0:48:27] <+FrostedZaibatsu> Nope just play till the Credits, then complain the game was shit
[0:48:28] <mai_cu> cant believe people actually dropped it on ending A
[0:48:31] <Louie_Salmon> The people who made this would like very much for you to keep playing. This message is brought to you by the marketing team, who would also like for you to continue playing
[0:48:34] <%Garthunox> Dont pull a Matt
[0:48:38] <%sporeian94> OH GOD KAINE IS ON THE SCREEN! I'M GONNA COOOOOOMMMMM
[0:48:42] <+StatesmanPrimal> drakkenguard three is ok
[0:48:48] <CriscoKnight> @acridpaladin Sorry I worded that poorly, I meant more like any performance differences
[0:48:53] <CriscoKnight> between ps4 and 5
[0:48:54] <%acridpaladin> acridpaladin subscribed with Prime. 
[0:49:06] <%SunnyVarietyPack> how much damage does the sword do and what story is tied to it
[0:49:06] <%solracc25> ouch
[0:49:07] <+Huderga> is pat using 2B's sword?
[0:49:10] <mycoldshoulder> drakengard 3 is actually amazing
[0:49:11] <+RowenCleric> drakengard 3 is.... something alright
[0:49:11] <SirDogBear> You are done when you watch the  Musical on Stage to get the extra lore CorgiDerp
[0:49:20] <Ethel9727> Drakengard 3 is quite solid as long as you play it on an emulator so you can get a steady framerate
[0:49:25] <ScreamLord> Does it feel like the game wasn't quite rebalanced for the new combat system?
[0:49:28] <%Aeogard> drakengard 3 is awesome but held back a lot by its performance by being stuck on ps3 and badly optimized
[0:49:29] <%walternatorz> is that the whole name? "Forest of Myth Motherfuckers"
[0:49:31] <SPARDA990> Drakengard 2 is better
[0:49:33] <CappuccinoGuil> @Huderga yes, might be special edition or pre-order DLC stuff
[0:49:37] <%Monkeyweed21> @SirDogBear theres more after that
[0:49:40] <+StatesmanPrimal> I mean if we're talking emulated drakken3 is fine
[0:49:40] <+tussletoes> drakengard 3 is its own beast. do emulate it if you plan on playing it
[0:49:44] <%Dakuu75> @SirDogBear thought you were done when the game makes you delete your save, lol
[0:49:45] <%sporeian94> Is there a medium yoko Taro hasn't used yet to tell his story?
[0:49:45] <+D00msDayDan> forest of holomyth
[0:49:46] <+PkSilent01> Visual novel time
[0:49:50] <CappuccinoGuil> @walternatorz it's what the tourists call it. Kappa
[0:49:51] <mycoldshoulder> I will play D3 in 12fps like God intended
[0:49:59] <+FutbolCEO> book time
[0:50:02] <%torusendor> Lvl 4 Cruel Oath is phoenix spear busted
[0:50:03] <Zerud> how long is drakengard 3? As big as Nier?
[0:50:05] <%WhereIsWill> this music tho
[0:50:07] <SirDogBear> @Monkeyweed21 True! The Sock Puppet Show 2 months later was extra BibleThump
[0:50:07] <%Dakuu75> for true?!
[0:50:14] <+StatesmanPrimal> we should really get a drakkenguard one remake
[0:50:15] <+tussletoes> Everyone sit around the campfire
[0:50:19] <%BoxNavy> :)
[0:50:21] <+bluedude153> I saw the forest and I clapped
[0:50:22] <%maybefalco> its so weird to see the game move at normal speed after completing the game on pc with no fps lock
[0:50:23] <%ringabal> WHOOPS
[0:50:24] <LordOfThePoultry> fuck that guy
[0:50:25] <CappuccinoGuil> Real For???
[0:50:25] <Blank9> yoko taro has yet to use formula 1 racing as a medium for storytelling
[0:50:26] <%Dementedpenguin> Wow, I didn't see that thankfully.
[0:50:27] <Ethel9727> @spongeofmystery They haven't let him make an official porn parody...yet
[0:50:28] <%walternatorz> good thing I'm blind.
[0:50:29] <+StatesmanPrimal> oh they did? dang
[0:50:30] <%sporeian94> 9S plays the bongos with 2B's cheeks
[0:50:30] <%WhereIsWill> get rekt
[0:50:31] <Louie_Salmon> Yeah not just like, randomly
[0:50:34] <%Aeogard> drakengard 3 can take forever because the final ending is super difficult lol
[0:50:37] <%livlinn> woolieONEGUY
[0:50:37] <+RowenCleric> drakengard 1 remake would actually be amazing
[0:50:37] <olaksi> yeah don't spoil what happens with the fish
[0:50:38] <dinnydanny777> oh I'm glad I didn't see that
[0:50:38] <Ninoace> welp
[0:50:39] <%SunnyVarietyPack> wow what an ass
[0:50:39] <+Huderga> lul what a dumb dumb
[0:50:43] <%RoboticAnimeDude> yeah that's pretty dumb to do
[0:50:50] <+mikesapartment> I can't believe NieR automotates himself
[0:50:54] <mycoldshoulder> Bruh moment
[0:50:55] <+Kindan55> @maybefalco There's a fan patch that completely fixes that now
[0:50:59] <CappuccinoGuil> @sporeian94 pretty sure you played the wrong game if that's the ending you got Kappa
[0:51:04] <Ethel9727> Tbh I would legitimately love to see Pat play through Drakengard 3 even though I think he knows the whole thing already from lore videos
[0:51:07] <+MelodyMedley> Well that guy's an idiot LUL
[0:51:08] <+tussletoes> Seeing people play at ridiculous fast speeds because they didn't lock the framerate is hilarious
[0:51:11] <%BoxNavy> they even highlited the message and no one saw it lol
[0:51:14] <boardscanada> a lot of effort went into voicing all these random NPCs for this remake

[0:51:42] <boardscanada> this dude looks so weird for a medieval setting - it's like he's from the present day LOL
[0:51:42] <%BoxNavy> this part is fine
[0:51:45] <%solracc25> Bad words
[0:51:46] <+Rawowner333> Automata's game end is ending E. The game will specify which letter ending you got
[0:51:51] <heartlesshealer> Welcome to the forest of myth everyone
[0:51:52] <$Falilth> did they add the novella to the end of this game ?
[0:51:56] <dinnydanny777> This dialogue is funny though
[0:51:57] <thevoiceofcheese> Wake the dreamer
[0:52:05] <SirDogBear> The ending I got involved Nier paying all the library late fines Weiss accumulated CorgiDerp
[0:52:08] <+StatesmanPrimal> @oranhexthief the elf, or the OTHER one? they're both pretty yikes
[0:52:14] <%BoxNavy> DEATHDREAM
[0:52:16] <%Dakuu75> why are you dreaming about young boys, old-man~?!

[0:52:52] <+Rawowner333> Dethdream
[0:52:53] <+StatesmanPrimal> this section is amazing
[0:52:59] <+FutbolCEO> i love how the text box just slowly creeps up the screen in this part
[0:53:02] <%solracc25> Books can't dream
[0:53:05] <%linSP> get owned book
[0:53:09] <%GarbageNirvana> I forgot this is how this part of the game goes
[0:53:18] <+RowenCleric> the voice acting makes this part great
[0:53:20] <$OranHexthief> @StatesmanPrimal i think the elf could possibly get a pass but the other one would definitely paint a pretty big target on squares back if they kept him as is
[0:53:24] <%Dakuu75> So... the characters can hear the narrating? lol
[0:53:27] <boardscanada> love how they anticipated the streamer narrating the non-narrated text, then the voice actors responding to it
[0:53:33] <%BoxNavy> chat yes or no, is there an explanation for the deathdream?
[0:53:34] <Tuna_Can_0> was the word dream Kappa
[0:53:50] <+Rawowner333> no?
[0:53:52] <Ethel9727> Wow, Weiss getting personal
[0:53:53] <%linSP> gasbag!
[0:53:54] <SirDogBear> The explanation is it all just a dream Snake Eater PogChamp
[0:53:54] <Ninoace> Weiss is great LUL
[0:53:54] <+cade_calrayn> Weiss is such a mood
[0:53:55] <CappuccinoGuil> @Dakuu75 seems only Weiss does?
[0:53:59] <%ringabal> Hah! Pat IS bloated!
[0:54:00] <%solracc25> Book power
[0:54:00] <+D00msDayDan> damn weiss just called pat a bloated gasbag
[0:54:03] <+StatesmanPrimal> feels bad, because the chemistry of how all your characters are huge villains works really well
[0:54:09] <boardscanada> Pat the bloated gasbag
[0:54:19] <+BIumen> explanation? it's a magic disease the nier world is used to that

[1:29:10] <RubberFistFight> @Rhrm the nier wiki has a bunch of the stories translated. Warning: the one called "Witch's Sabbath" is a little... confronting... about certain things.
[1:29:10] <42nfl19> oh no PTSD

[1:31:17] <Saltmeisterr> The fuck does that mean?
[1:31:24] <+D00msDayDan> yoko taro wrote nier thinking that the guys behind 9/11 thought what they were doing was absolutely righteous
[1:31:24] <+Exicuren> Fuck, Pat's right, I didn't think about it
[1:31:28] <+Rawowner333> nooooo. he has one too?
[1:31:40] <Ravioli_Ronin> Nine elevenier
[1:31:42] <InugamiTheHound> wasn't nier influenced  by the iraq war @PatStaresAt
[1:31:48] <RubberFistFight> @pixelkenj "Only who can prevent forest fires? You pressed 'you' referring to me. That is incorrect. The correct answer is you."
[1:31:56] <Rhrm> Nier Osama makes sense since he's the cause of humanities extinction.
[1:31:57] <LordOfThePoultry> are horses even around anymore?
[1:32:00] <%GalacticaPhanto> @inugamithehound 9/11 specifically
[1:32:14] <zenith0111> Oooooh
[1:32:14] <radioamnesiac> did they change his birthday?
[1:32:18] <+StatesmanPrimal> 9/11 plus bioweapon attack
[1:32:19] <RubberFistFight> ah damnit Pat i was just about to explain that and you did. Damnit.
[1:32:20] <Ethel9727> "You don't need to be insane to do evil, you just need to be right."
[1:32:23] <%JohnAtDawn> Real big talk coming from Japan.
[1:32:23] <RubberFistFight> Damn you, streamer.
[1:32:24] <%BoxNavy> a peas :)
[1:32:25] <zenith0111> The imagery makes mote sense now
[1:32:32] <yourliteraldog> Nier and Friendz fun time Jihad
[1:32:33] <shieldecho> @radioamnesiac It's June 6
[1:32:34] <zenith0111> Ruined skyscrapers
[1:32:35] <cardamomo88> :) :) horse
[1:32:38] <zenith0111> I get it now
[1:32:43] <InugamiTheHound> @GalacticaPhanto ok. I thought it was iraq war after 9/11 but 9/11 its self is important event.
[1:32:49] <+StatesmanPrimal> yeah it's based around those who believe that their justice or ideal is the right one
[1:32:56] <%ringabal> "People can do a lot of things, if you convince them they're right."
[1:32:57] <radioamnesiac> bummer
[1:33:00] <RubberFistFight> @JohnAtDawn Taro was talking about that kind of thing in general, it's just that 9/11 happened right when he was thinking about making a game so it was the salient example.
[1:33:01] <boardscanada> Iraq War is probably Facade vs. the wolves
[1:33:13] <RubberFistFight> @ringabal if they convince THEMSELVES they are right.
[1:33:15] <%templar010> I dont like that
[1:33:23] <+JustToWatch> that sounds like a horrible festival
[1:33:28] <%maybefalco> nier cant make it, he has to water his carpet
[1:33:37] <%Dakuu75> ...
[1:33:40] <InugamiTheHound> @boardscanada i know the iraq war was a influence for gundam 00
[1:33:41] <%RetroCop87> that sounds cult-like
[1:33:43] <RubberFistFight> @maybefalco he's gotta go iron his dog.
[1:34:06] <Jaysky> C O U G H
[1:34:09] <%BoxNavy> :)
[1:34:09] <%valriot> All women should be bald
[1:34:10] <heartlesshealer> gotta watch the eggs
[1:34:15] <zenith0111> Lmao
[1:34:15] <+JustToWatch> so they definitely eat people at that festival right?
[1:34:16] <Ethel9727> Of course the give up king would say that
[1:34:16] <Daxalog> Ive never been on a date
[1:34:18] <cardamomo88> Kappa Kappa
[1:34:18] <Louie_Salmon> Giving up is always good advice
[1:34:19] <%TIME_PUNCHER> don't people wash their hair *every* night? or are these Smash players
[1:34:22] <RubberFistFight> Yeah don't say that shit to people. Be honest. Just say "no i don't want to" and stop being a fucking coward.
[1:34:25] <InugamiTheHound> does Paige do that to pat @PatStaresAt
[1:34:25] <%cvp5127> Kappa
[1:34:29] <%RetroCop87> "gotta go wash my hair" said the bald man
[1:34:30] <+StatesmanPrimal> it's all about how those who believe they're right, and pay no mind to the suffering they cause
[1:34:31] <%Jay_Squirrel> what if ive never gotten an excuse like that but instead they just say no and then i walk off and be sad
[1:34:33] <boardscanada> it's also like a reverse Drakengard - in Drakengard there were no likeable characters going on a murderous genocidal rampage, in Nier it's likeable relatable characters doing the same thing  thinking they're doing the right thing
[1:34:35] <cardamomo88> shes busy
[1:34:39] <mai_cu> ya gotta fish at the otherrr beachhh
[1:34:47] <%moogleboy1984> @TIME_PUNCHER It's incredibly unhealthy to wash your hair every day
[1:34:50] <%cvp5127> a day
[1:34:50] <ThDark> Days at a time
[1:34:51] <%valriot> Paaat-uh my hair
[1:34:52] <nevan_44> LUL
[1:35:05] <heartlesshealer> paige actually washes her hair
[1:35:06] <+StatesmanPrimal> in drakkenguard you know you're the villain, it's not vague at all
[1:35:08] <Clundy> @time_puncher it’s unhealthy to shampoo and condition your hair every single day. But you should still rinse it and comb it depending on length
[1:35:09] <%Dakuu75> long hair takes a while to clean guys.
[1:35:11] <%Monkeyweed21> I have long hair and need like an hour to wash it
[1:35:18] <RubberFistFight> @StatesmanPrimal what i like is how as the game grinds on and how the "wrongness" of the main characters is harder for them to ignore, their rationalisations start to become weaker and weaker.
[1:35:18] <$WaitHowDidIGetHere> @inugamithehound “Sorry, I can’t make it to our wedding; I’ve gotta wash my hair.”
[1:35:21] <+Rawowner333> lit is a word
[1:35:23] <%RetroCop87> oh yeah, time for the Spencer Estate!
[1:35:31] <%TIME_PUNCHER> @moogleboy1984 how long are people spending washing their hair then?
[1:35:32] <+BIumen> emil's mansion
[1:35:33] <%moogleboy1984> Estate
[1:35:33] <%torusendor> EMil
[1:35:36] <RubberFistFight> oh my god this music
[1:35:37] <+Rawowner333> after emil joins your party
[1:35:37] <%RetroCop87> you'll no when you're about to hit it
[1:35:39] <Parapattern> "It was VERY Based."
[1:35:39] <%BestTeaMaker> Emil
[1:35:40] <%templar010> Time for WHAT A MANSION
[1:35:40] <+PkSilent01> Emil
[1:35:40] <jcflyguy> Mansion
[1:35:44] <boardscanada> I really wouldn't like a Drakengard 1 remake without that horrible soundtrack, it's like 90% of what makes the game such an experience
[1:35:44] <42nfl19> @PatStaresAt Washing hair? I never understood that. Like if you are in there washing your hair, just take a full shower.
[1:35:45] <%Agami23> my hair takes forever to dry.
[1:35:45] <%Valdorick> Should be Emil's estate
[1:35:45] <%miguelrod777> nyoom
[1:35:47] <Tracazoid> Her asking you to see Emil
[1:35:47] <heartlesshealer> You know when
[1:35:47] <zenith0111> At the end of Nier it did turn into a "Us VS Them" scenario so everyone is just doing what they can really.
[1:35:48] <%SunnyVarietyPack> mansion
[1:35:51] <+cade_calrayn> getting sent to the mansion
[1:35:52] <+D00msDayDan> the actual point of no return is after emil, when popola asks you for some moss
[1:35:54] <Djinnazz> Eafter Emil
[1:35:56] <+BIumen> yeah just wrap everything up before going to emil's
[1:35:57] <InugamiTheHound> @boardscanada I think drakengard also had a pedo as a teammate. I've never seen any video game with pedo as teammate to help save the world.
[1:36:01] <%torusendor> Emil is the deadline for ALL quests
[1:36:10] <%valriot> Can just buy watermelon and pumpkin from facade
[1:36:12] <%cvp5127> vapor moss
[1:36:17] <%RetroCop87> you can still do Emil's Mansion and then do quests
[1:36:19] <@commanderclaw> Yep, it's after Emil
[1:36:22] <+Rawowner333> which is immediately after emil
[1:36:25] <+BIumen> @PatStaresAt This happened to me, I fucked up that quest because I did the emil stuff and couldn't deliver to Yonah
[1:36:29] <%RetroCop87> cheap
[1:36:30] <%torusendor> Not much
[1:36:30] <@commanderclaw> 500ish
[1:36:31] <%Dakuu75> 15 bucks?
[1:36:33] <%RetroCop87> watermelon is 800
[1:36:33] <%valriot> 1200 together I think
[1:36:34] <zenith0111> A LOT
[1:36:34] <%Agami23> like 400 and 500 i think
[1:36:34] <boardscanada> like if they did a Drakengard 1 remake with this Emi Evans-like soundtrack that'd be a total missed opportunity and really piss on Drakengard's legacy, the music is meant to be emotionally draining and repetitive
[1:36:35] <%SunnyVarietyPack> no thats for part 1
[1:36:35] <%MelBrooksKA> couple dollars
[1:36:38] <%thedankestmeeme> facade?
[1:36:39] <+Qexec> like 1200
[1:36:40] <shieldecho> I THINK 700 and 500 respectively
[1:36:41] <Devbob98> 1 mill
[1:36:41] <pixelkenj> Fish up some catfish
[1:36:42] <%ringabal> Less than you think, more than you'd like
[1:36:43] <+FutbolCEO> 500k
[1:36:44] <%SunnyVarietyPack> yonah cuts off before that
[1:36:47] <+StatesmanPrimal> @rubberfistfight at a certain point they realize what they've done and can no longer turn away from what they did
[1:36:47] <pixelkenj> Sell dented metal plates
[1:36:49] <mycoldshoulder> I wanna play drakengard 1 for the experience, but i also really fucking don't
[1:36:50] <heartlesshealer> but the deal is you're kinda locked into emil once you're in-in I think
[1:36:51] <+cade_calrayn> @PatStaresAt the moment you go into the mansion, Yonah's quest breaks, I did it yesterday and Yonah's quest becomes Uncompleteable cause you can't leave the mansion and she gets sick afterwards
[1:36:53] <%Dakuu75> (omg... he meant in game...)
[1:36:54] <zenith0111> Youre going to need 10 watermelons later too
[1:37:09] <+cade_calrayn> it may actually be when she tells you about the letter that breaks it
[1:37:11] <boardscanada> I just don't think a Drakengard 1 remake is a good idea in 2021, it would get censored to high hell
[1:37:13] <%Jaxnos> fiiiiiish
[1:37:14] <@commanderclaw> Watermelons are only at the Facade grocer
[1:37:16] <zenith0111> Black Bass PogChamp
[1:37:18] <%Monkeyweed21> @InugamiTheHound the whole theme of Drakenguard is that to kill as many people as the average game protag, you would need to be a miserable psycho, so everyone on the team is a psycho scumbag
[1:37:19] <%torusendor> Just finished alloy grinding, now Iron Will is fucking FAT
[1:37:20] <+Rawowner333> feeesh
[1:37:23] <shieldecho> You need a pumpkin after the watermelon
[1:37:26] <42nfl19> @PatStaresAt Solve it? Are you going on another bathroom break? ;)
[1:37:31] <+StatesmanPrimal> the reality of their actions finally catches up with them, once nier himself learns to understand

[1:37:32] <%RetroCop87> You can get a 4,000+ gold fish in the East path

[1:37:37] <shieldecho> Sorry
[1:37:41] <dinnydanny777> I watched someone play Drakengard, it looked miserable
[1:37:42] <Jaysky> Oh shit are we at the true purpose of the game
[1:37:50] <RubberFistFight> DRAMATIC FISHING MUSIC INTENSIFIES
[1:37:53] <+D00msDayDan> @RetroCop87 and in the time it takes for him to fish one up right now he could fish up like 4 of these

[1:38:04] <%ringabal> GO KIRITO, REEL IN THE BIG ONE
[1:38:04] <%cvp5127> 36 sidequests
[1:38:06] <Devbob98> This is the real game
[1:38:06] <boardscanada> @dinnydanny777 yeah I like to look at it as Yoko Taro's metacommentary on musou games, that they're terrible games LULW
[1:38:08] <cubelock555> drakengard causes physical pain
[1:38:09] <InugamiTheHound> @Monkeyweed21 yeah I know that but just thinking about having a pedo as teammate is really weird but yet it works in drakenguard.
[1:38:11] <+StatesmanPrimal> the issue with drakkenguard is just how old and unoptimized it is
[1:38:11] <%Monkeyweed21> part 1 isnt that long
[1:38:15] <%Jay_Squirrel> make child be taller
[1:38:19] <%Aeogard> only during part b do you really gotta do side quests
[1:38:23] <42nfl19> @PatStaresAt I think you talked about this before, but which game has the best Fishing mini-game?
[1:38:23] <ThDark> The real game starts NOW
[1:38:24] <zenith0111> Side quests is the game tbh lol if your try to force it to be anime you get Harvest Moon
[1:38:26] <%RetroCop87> @D00msDayDan yeah, but then he won't be a big dick G
[1:38:36] <Rhrm> What's his side quest progression percentage?
[1:38:41] <pixelkenj> dont forget the mutton quest
[1:38:43] <Jaysky> D:
[1:38:43] <Oxybe> Yo, i was playing around with the new Layered Armour in MH Rise and now i look like OG pigman Gannon from the NES. it's dumb that i like this so much.

[1:39:05] <%Monkeyweed21> @InugamiTheHound the irony is that the pedo is by far the goodest party member because of his self-loathing and restraint
[1:39:05] <boardscanada> Leonard would totally be censored, like it was already really ambiguous in the version we got but it'd probaby be completely rewritten - at that point might as well launch the original in an emulator and suffer through the bad gameplay

[1:39:58] <dinnydanny777> NotLikeThis
[1:40:00] <+JustToWatch> Pat you need goat meat
[1:40:01] <%Valdorick> Shittalking is the gift of siblings.
[1:40:06] <%thedankestmeeme> dont talk shit about total!
[1:40:08] <boardscanada> also how do you make Drakengard 1 have enjoyable gameplay without losing the experience? and how can you really make something out of a musou game and a bad ace combat clone?
[1:40:13] <%bread_assassin> Even when they were TERMINALLY ILL?
[1:40:17] <+JustToWatch> like 3 I think
[1:40:17] <+StatesmanPrimal> ye Leonard was actually the most sympathetic character, he hated what he was and might've done so much, and had such restraint as a result
[1:40:20] <+cade_calrayn> you need Goat Hides
[1:40:21] <@commanderclaw> Gotta make NieR Schwarma
[1:40:32] <+Rawowner333> not for gradma or yohna
[1:40:34] <%arcielardor> you need 20 goat skins and like 5 goat meat
[1:40:34] <+cade_calrayn> 10 of them for the merchant quest
[1:40:36] <%Monkeyweed21> @InugamiTheHound the monk is racist, the elf is a hardcore cannibal, and the boy is the worst of all
[1:40:41] <Devbob98> She was easy to pick on for Pat
[1:40:44] <heartlesshealer> wow pat
[1:40:46] <%RetroCop87> make sure you get 10 scorpion claws while you're out here, for your wyrm claw upgrade
[1:40:47] <%valriot> When is Weiss gonna tell about the hit MMO FFXIV, now free up to level 60, including the award winning Heavensward expansion
[1:40:54] <yourliteraldog> Pretty boy Cannibal Elf girl, child and child molester by their powers combined they ruin everything
[1:40:56] <DagetStreams> That's the most brother thing I've ever heard
[1:41:03] <Vertigheist> I share pat's sentiment
[1:41:06] <InugamiTheHound> @Monkeyweed21 why is the monk racist and why is the boy so terrible?
[1:41:06] <%Agami23> you should especially talk shit to terminally ill siblings. if you dont they will freak out and know something is extra bad.
[1:41:11] <boardscanada> I'd say instead of doing a plain remake of Drakengard, rebuild it from the ground up - maybe make it an open world Ghost of Tsushima-like game or whatever - I just don't think you can make anything good out of a musou and ace combat game
[1:41:13] <zenith0111> @boardscanada Scrapping those concepts completely and let platinum games make it
[1:41:17] <+StatesmanPrimal> I would say the elf was the worst of all, she straight up just ate babies

[1:41:28] <heartlesshealer> it's critically acclaimed
[1:41:31] <dinnydanny777> The monk is the most annoying character in Drakengard because he isn't a scumbag
[1:41:32] <%RetroCop87> aw yeah, time to solo the wolf den!
[1:41:38] <cardamomo88> kids this day
[1:41:40] <pixelkenj> and then we just leave him behind
[1:41:40] <%valriot> Ending FF :)
[1:41:45] <+cade_calrayn> this fucking kid
[1:41:47] <+RyTYoung> GO HOME KID
[1:41:52] <%Dakuu75> is this the same dood-bro from the waterfront?
[1:41:54] <boardscanada> @zenith0111 yeah I think they should drop musou and ace combat completely and do something else entirely - the story itself is still good but it needs entirely different gameplay
[1:42:02] <%Monkeyweed21> @InugamiTheHound the monk loves cleansing the ""subhumans"" and the boy caused the apocalypse out of selfishness
[1:42:05] <+StatesmanPrimal> the monk is a scumbag by association and not even trying to stop us
[1:42:12] <RubberFistFight> So does anyone know if they redid the dialogue or if they're just using the stuff from the OG game?
[1:42:23] <+PkSilent01> Im not Owned, Im not owned
[1:42:25] <+RyTYoung> @dakuu75 nah that's a different annoying "kid"
[1:42:27] <%Dakuu75> LOL
[1:42:28] <+cade_calrayn> God I love their bickering
[1:42:28] <+StatesmanPrimal> I forgot the monk was a nazi

[1:42:44] <%linSP> kaine talking mad shit while her crack is full a sand
[1:42:44] <%valriot> Need me a relationship where we just call each other Book and Hussy
[1:42:45] <boardscanada> @RubberFistFight I have noticed several differences in dialogue between brother and papa
[1:42:47] <cardamomo88> LUL
[1:42:48] <InugamiTheHound> @Monkeyweed21 okay I get that with the  monk now. But why did the boy caused the world's end?
[1:42:51] <%Dakuu75> no synergy, no teamwork, not organic

[1:43:21] <+StatesmanPrimal> the boy was a sociopath that didn't care he ended the world
[1:43:23] <boardscanada> I actually like being able to spot the differences, Papa Nier was not a simple model swap, there is some nice contextual changes in the script based on him being a father
[1:43:23] <pixelkenj> stay on the left from the entrance

[1:43:41] <%RetroCop87> it's a doggone shame
[1:43:42] <+cade_calrayn> The Book and the Hussy.... and Emil's just there being a pure child who's also madly in love with Nier
[1:43:47] <dinnydanny777> Oh yeah i forgot that about the monk, he still never shuts up and criticises you for killing though limesHmm

[1:44:14] <boardscanada> I must say I was really surprised how high budget Drakengard 1's CG cutscenes looked
[1:44:17] <%RetroCop87> it's getting pretty ruff out there
[1:44:18] <+Rawowner333> go south
[1:44:19] <Link232> awww the cat baby look at him he cat

[1:44:37] <$WaitHowDidIGetHere> psaBlep psaBlep psaBlep
[1:44:46] <yourliteraldog> Drakengaurd is the game in which your sisters dies cus your not into incest right.
[1:44:48] <%YakumoYomi> @RetroCop87 INAFF
[1:44:48] <Vertigheist> @boardscanada the story probably wouldn't be the same if it's gonna be released by today's standards. Especially since the only reason drakengard 1 got released the way it did was it was to tiresome for sony to review before releasing
[1:44:53] <+StatesmanPrimal> the monk was pretty much that crypto fascist from disco elysium last night
[1:44:58] <+CookieCutter007> Zero's CG model is so good
[1:45:00] <boardscanada> that Furia cutscene in like Ending B will never not be incredibly creepy
[1:45:05] <%ClericOfSparda> wow
[1:45:06] <%RetroCop87> @YakumoYomi fine, I'll throw you a bone
[1:45:08] <Daxalog> Non descript canine being killed in the distance.
[1:45:11] <Djinnazz> @yourliteraldog or gets turned into a demon.
[1:45:14] <Vertigheist> @yourliteraldog yeah lol
[1:45:16] <RubberFistFight> @boardscanada which one?
[1:45:26] <zenith0111> @yourliteraldog And your pet dragon has a piss scene
[1:45:27] <boardscanada> the one with the seeds of resurrection
[1:45:29] <%czeekytv> @StatesmanPrimal I just ran into that guy in DE and bullied him so hard, very rewarding haha
[1:45:34] <%YakumoYomi> @RetroCop87 psaSmug
[1:45:36] <InugamiTheHound> bork busters
[1:45:52] <%Agami23> wait. did the spear have a different attack when you dodged then used it?
[1:45:54] <Jaysky> We
[1:45:54] <RubberFistFight> pupsnuffers incorporated
[1:45:55] <ScreamLord> Yet
[1:45:57] <%ringabal> Bones: Quickly Broken
[1:46:03] <%ElkRiverDog> This dude is about to wipe a whole pack just to make his wee wee feel big
[1:46:04] <%Valdorick> Sure you aren't, Nierman
[1:46:12] <+StatesmanPrimal> he talks all about the elves being subhuman trash and is way too much of a coward to commit to it
[1:46:25] <boardscanada> think they'd let FF14 get invaded by giant human babies with sharp teeth?
[1:46:27] <%RetroCop87> the missing Facade daughter quest is pretty funny
[1:46:29] <peyodogo> what movie
[1:46:29] <Devbob98> He did all the work
[1:46:30] <dinnydanny777> We saved the city limesDab
[1:46:31] <+senfood> Elmo wants to watch Yasuke.
[1:46:31] <yourliteraldog> Drakengaurd sounds cool as shit if wasn't like broken and shit
[1:46:34] <peyodogo> what does elmo want to watch
[1:46:39] <RubberFistFight> @ElkRiverDog and he wound up needing to get saved by a prettyboy, a bitch and a talking book.
[1:46:43] <RubberFistFight> bet he feels real big now.
[1:46:45] <BlackStarAura> Lies
[1:47:06] <Devbob98> You’re dumb, join the army
[1:47:06] <%Dakuu75> So, why dose Weiss hang out with Nier? Why doesn't he just float away?
[1:47:07] <CappuccinoGuil> YEAH, 10K!
[1:47:10] <+StatesmanPrimal> mostly because the elf in your party is way tougher than him, as are most elves in that universe
[1:47:10] <DagetStreams> Bravest coward I ever knew
[1:47:21] <Rhrm> the missing Facade daughter quest didn't make any sense to me.
[1:47:21] <+FutbolCEO> everyone in facade is rich af
[1:47:32] <+JustToWatch> food shop next to palace
[1:47:33] <%RetroCop87> fruit stand
[1:47:34] <%maybefalco> i guess somehow cowardice is no where in their 100k+ rules
[1:47:37] <%RetroCop87> near the palace
[1:47:40] <Sypheck> that quest sound reminds me of Windows booting up or something LUL
[1:47:40] <+Rawowner333> the other side
[1:47:40] <RubberFistFight> @Dakuu75 Nierman convinced him to go murdering. Gives him a book boner.
[1:47:56] <%Monkeyweed21> @yourliteraldog its a bad musou and a bad panzer dragoon clone
[1:48:00] <%RetroCop87> if you go in the palace while you're here, you can see the Prince trying to score with Fyra
[1:48:05] <+Rawowner333> that wasn't specific. it's a big suare...but yes by the palace
[1:48:06] <marrowjuice> THE BABY
[1:48:13] <%Dakuu75> lol
[1:48:19] <Djinnazz> @Rhrm i think it was because she was already a shade.
[1:48:20] <boardscanada> all that talking during the memory tree segments did you in
[1:48:24] <%Jay_Squirrel> sorry youre low on boner power, pat
[1:48:28] <+FutbolCEO> buy 10 watermellon for the secret item quest too
[1:48:35] <%echobee_tv> When we splicing flowers, boys?
[1:48:40] <%cvp5127> just do emil then do sidequest offscreen
[1:48:43] <CappuccinoGuil> Dude, go to bed if you're so tired, rest is important
[1:48:45] <%psidefx> AS IT SHOULD!
[1:48:47] <%Garthunox> Can i give you some boner power to help?
[1:48:47] <%RetroCop87> speaking of, do the divorce quest while you're here
[1:48:47] <+StatesmanPrimal> what was the main character again in drakken 1, he was a big mass murderer war criminal right?
[1:48:55] <Blank9> if you were a true communist you would have at least 8 hours of boners ready
[1:49:07] <peyodogo> yea thats okay, sometimes you need to go to bed early and nurse your squalid boner
[1:49:12] <boardscanada> Caim, but basically I feel like grown brother Nier looks a lot like him, perhaps intentional
[1:49:13] <vapidq> Caim
[1:49:26] <+StatesmanPrimal> SQUALID
[1:49:27] <%RetroCop87> pat...
[1:49:28] <yourliteraldog> @StatesmanPrimal A guy who didn't want to fuck his anime sister

[1:49:34] <dinnydanny777> Caim
[1:49:40] <%linSP> aint that the guy from FF8
[1:49:40] <Kain5707> based
[1:49:40] <CappuccinoGuil> @Blank9 How else are we going to fuck capitalism?

[1:51:24] <RubberFistFight> @PatStaresAt if you haven't already done that lizard quest, would it not be wise to either kill or grab those lizords? whatever the quest wanted?

[1:53:34] <peyodogo> yeah pat's got it, don't think there's much need to coach unless something's changed for replicant
[1:53:35] <+CursedNobleman> @moogleboy1984 what is this, animal crossing? LUL

[1:54:04] <%maybefalco> @vapidq i didnt even reach 60% by the time i made it to route E, 100% is probably some real tedious shit
[1:54:06] <%Monkeyweed21> WATERMELON AND PUMPKIN
[1:54:08] <%ringabal> aaaaaaanimeeeeeeeeee
[1:54:09] <yourliteraldog> They didn't put in a cake asset
[1:54:10] <+Rawowner333> oh thank christ, thanks pat
[1:54:10] <%torusendor> Fully upgraded Iron Will still clips through the ground when sheathed lol
[1:54:14] <zenith0111> The farming isnt that bad if youre already planning on doing the grind anyways
[1:54:16] <+bassoontyphoon> sipsipGasm

[1:54:23] <+polothegreatest> yukiko recipe
[1:54:23] <+StatesmanPrimal> ah yes he must use [Crazy Talk]  to affect the time stream
[1:54:23] <shieldecho> I mean it's a fruitcake and they're never good anyway so technically it's not her fault
[1:54:25] <CappuccinoGuil> YOU DON'T HAVE A FRIDGE
[1:54:25] <%king_wragles> Nier ate the mackerel to avoid Yonah's cooking
[1:54:30] <%Wallabri> look at him wiggle on the chair
[1:54:32] <reonome> HAHA SHE CAN'T COOK THATS THE JOKE
[1:54:33] <boardscanada> well doing the quests is much more tolerable at least because of everything being fully voiced
[1:54:34] <%Wallabri> RIP nier
[1:54:37] <Tracazoid> Nier has now contracted the Black Scrawl, turns out it was because of Yonah's cooking all along.
[1:54:40] <%ElkRiverDog> For real tho fruit pizza is the bomb
[1:54:41] <CappuccinoGuil> Those cakes are going TO FUCKING SPOIL
[1:54:42] <%The_Gaming_Karp> Eating Yonah's cake results in a permanent debuff.
[1:54:42] <Sypheck> no icebox
[1:54:48] <vapidq> @maybefalco it sure seems like it, and not only that, there are some that are missable, really yikes
[1:54:50] <zenith0111> Thanks Yonah
[1:54:55] <%SunnyVarietyPack> thats all the important quests don
[1:54:57] <RubberFistFight> man, in the Ps3 version, Weiss is like "why do you lie to her about the bad food?" and papa nier is like "Because she's my daughter and she's sick, you fucking asshole."
[1:55:01] <RubberFistFight> And weiss is like "yeah that's fair."
[1:55:01] <drawertogether> Fast travel
[1:55:01] <zenith0111> Cooler stuff in part 2
[1:55:03] <squeakyclarinet> Boat's
[1:55:03] <Devbob98> You got mail I think
[1:55:03] <+StatesmanPrimal> where's the damn lamb sauce yonah!
[1:55:06] <%Monkeyweed21> she is an adorably stupid child
[1:55:11] <karovus> as someone who is waiting like 2 real days to finish a gardening side quest, dont do all the quests unless you hate yourself
[1:55:12] <hat_under_bread> @The_Gaming_Karp Worth it to be a good brother.
[1:55:13] <yourliteraldog> Yonah you read books how are you so dumb
[1:55:22] <squeakyclarinet> Also, Part 1 Quests can't be done later.
[1:55:25] <boardscanada> Papa Nier was great, I still miss him
[1:55:26] <+StatesmanPrimal> I love gestalt so much
[1:55:30] <%RigmaroleHM> I miss Papa Nier
[1:55:31] <Blank9> papa nier is just himbo
[1:55:35] <%moogleboy1984> Words are missable
[1:55:38] <%RetroCop87> Papa Nier is the type I'd want to invite to my wedding
[1:55:44] <+Rawowner333> only some if any.
[1:55:47] <boardscanada> hopefully they realize how many fans still want him and do something about it
[1:55:47] <rekinom> Heart of gold, dumb of ass
[1:55:49] <%za7az> I miss Papa Nier...
[1:55:50] <Djinnazz> @karovus timezones man.
[1:55:51] <RubberFistFight> lol what about the bit where Pop/Dev are like "you have to sleep outside you whore" and Papa Nier just goes "THAT'S CRAP" @PatStaresAt
[1:55:51] <+bassoontyphoon> Papa nier is so much better than twink nier
[1:55:58] <%RetroCop87> fuck YOU dder!
[1:55:59] <Djinnazz> words aren't missable
[1:56:00] <%ringabal> Thousands of years in the future, anime girls will still make horrendous cooking.
[1:56:01] <%Monkeyweed21> none of the good ones are
[1:56:04] <+senfood> I'd want Papa Nier to help me change a tire.
[1:56:05] <%moogleboy1984> you only need 50% for the trophy, so meh
[1:56:06] <+StatesmanPrimal> such cowardice on display apriSadge
[1:56:08] <peyodogo> we goin to emil's?
[1:56:09] <tattleworm> hard's been a decent challenge so far but it's mostly huge boss lifebars
[1:56:11] <zenith0111> Words work off RNG
[1:56:12] <passiveaggressivekisses> daddy nier is top tier
[1:56:18] <cardamomo88> but do papa nier has the ass
[1:56:18] <zenith0111> So just kill kill kill
[1:56:25] <RubberFistFight> Jamieson Price did SUCH a fucking good job with that dialogue and character, man.
[1:56:28] <boardscanada> I've been going over some of the scenes between Gestalt Nier and this new remake and some of the text was definitely completely changed for the father
[1:56:31] <%RoboticAnimeDude> its really not, especially with some weapons and magic. its a cakewalk by the second playthrough
[1:56:33] <%Monkeyweed21> Did you get the quest from Devola?
[1:56:34] <RubberFistFight> he should get way more credit than he does for that.
[1:56:34] <SlimeSlimeSlime> Papa Nier all the way!
[1:56:38] <Devbob98> I’d buy game for him
[1:56:39] <%RetroCop87> odds on Papa Nier being modded into the PC version?
[1:56:39] <%RigmaroleHM> Maybe it's an unlockable
[1:56:42] <Clanes> Think someone will make a mod that rips the old papa nier voice lines?
[1:56:42] <+FutbolCEO> getting 100% of words really feels like it would ruin the game
[1:56:43] <RubberFistFight> Before he was coffeedad, he was DogfaceDad.
[1:56:45] <+StatesmanPrimal> I would play this if papa nier was in it, but I beat gestalt already
[1:56:48] <+D00msDayDan> gotta get to 2.5 million sales so they add papa nier
[1:56:51] <Sypheck> just give me a papa Nier DLC and I'll do this whole shit all over again
[1:56:52] <%RigmaroleHM> Or maybe they'll MAKE it an unlockable in a month
[1:56:53] <+JustToWatch> Apparently if it reaches half of Automata's sales they make DLC for it
[1:56:57] <%RigmaroleHM> So you have to play it again
[1:56:58] <+LionKagura> @boardscanada GASP really? who would have thunk
[1:57:00] <%RoboticAnimeDude> but what if they made him hot
[1:57:02] <mr_saturday93> yup!
[1:57:02] <%moogleboy1984> there are 13 missable words, but they're all in Part 2
[1:57:03] <karovus> i think yoko taro said they would consider adding papa nier if the game sold well enough, but he probably just meant as a costume
[1:57:03] <RubberFistFight> @Clanes have no doubt they're already working on it.
[1:57:03] <$Afterman_> sammy reigel and liam o brian
[1:57:08] <boardscanada> problem is if you mod him in, not everything in Nier OG is voiced, especially the sidequests
[1:57:11] <%RetroCop87> this fucking guy
[1:57:16] <mr_saturday93> and you get nothing outta this quest!
[1:57:16] <%Wallabri> bamboozled!
[1:57:18] <peyodogo> there's also been some extra script changes i've noticed, aside from dad-speciic things. kaine didn't call that big shade a bitch ass before
[1:57:19] <tattleworm> they put a new character with papa nier's clothes in nier reincarnation recently so i think they're priming jp for it
[1:57:28] <peyodogo> it was a more concise "i'll tear your heart out"
[1:57:39] <%RetroCop87> other postman
[1:57:50] <%RigmaroleHM> If they want more money they'll make a version with Papa Nier
[1:57:51] <boardscanada> @LionKagura yes, when you do the first junk heap quest for the kids, the conversations between Weiss and Nier are completely different
[1:57:51] <RubberFistFight> @boardscanada i think people would forgive that just for having the main dialogue. And i mean, Jamieson Price is still around, he did new dialogue for P5R so I'm sure he'd agree if they asked him.
[1:57:54] <+StatesmanPrimal> I could've sworn she said bitch ass before
[1:57:54] <%BoxNavy> monkaS
[1:58:08] <DickieWoodsmall_279> how many yuri lowenthals are in this?
[1:58:09] <zenith0111> Even then for completionlist there is no 100% word collection achievement just a 50% one
[1:58:19] <%RigmaroleHM> Oh my god Weiss' voice reminds me of Fluffy from 13Sentinels
[1:58:21] <RubberFistFight> @DickieWoodsmall_279 just one, he does all the voices.

[2:02:51] <%RetroCop87> @BestTeaMaker no, that's after Emil's mansion I think
[2:02:53] <boardscanada> I kind of tend to think of the side quests as something similar to Death Stranding, just running errands and going from one place to the other
[2:02:58] <%BestTeaMaker> no but there's a leadup
[2:03:07] <%BestTeaMaker> in part 1
[2:03:11] <+senfood> I always forget that Kaine does a Naruto run.

[2:03:57] <boardscanada> yeah instead of an Auto-Battle option they should have added an 'Auto-Quest' system
[2:03:59] <@commanderclaw> French man says Greek sound funny

[2:04:05] <%Monkeyweed21> Athens triumphed over SParta in the long run @PatStaresAt
[2:04:08] <%spitelite> whats up with french names
[2:04:09] <RubberFistFight> I mean a greek person could ask "why are all scandinavian names [fathers name]-son, or [father's name]-dottir"?
[2:04:10] <Volkrotia> My high school Psychology teacher was named Mrs. Spyropolous
[2:04:11] <+StatesmanPrimal> I agree, it's all that prick Zeus' fault

[2:04:28] <yourliteraldog> Honhon
[2:04:31] <$Ziegsy> Its because the name tends to be 'son of' or 'little' or 'from this place' so they get the same suffix

[2:06:40] <zenith0111> Ye that sounds about right
[2:06:45] <DickieWoodsmall_279> actually it's 1400+ in replicant
[2:06:48] <boardscanada> Weiss was a human that had to battle with other kids to the death until he got turned into a book right?
[2:06:49] <+fetrigon> fuck off book
[2:06:49] <%debugdrawray_> so is weiss just pure sentient magic or was he like a guy put into a book
[2:06:50] <CatRidder> 2021
[2:06:56] <filialpails> 1312 you say?
[2:07:00] <heartlesshealer> shhh
[2:07:01] <jin_kazamaru> Red Green is a better version of Home Improvement' Tool time bits with Tim Allen, but if the whole show was just the Tool Time bits... but better
[2:07:03] <RubberFistFight> So it's worth noting that this entire "replicant" plan was DOOMED TO FUCKING FAIL. Like from the outset, there was no possible way for it to work.
[2:07:04] <zenith0111> Black Scrawl went how long before Gestalt?

[2:07:20] <DickieWoodsmall_279> robot asses?
[2:07:23] <+BIumen> dont think about it
[2:07:25] <+Rawowner333> how????????
[2:07:28] <+D00msDayDan> maybe the androids built them
[2:07:32] <%cvp5127> shhhhhh
[2:07:33] <%RetroCop87> they're over the mountain
[2:07:35] <%rumtumtugnutz> Is Red Green Canadian Larry the Cable Guy?
[2:07:35] <iosephe> sssssshhhhhh
[2:07:35] <cardamomo88> aliens
[2:07:38] <KaitlynnHere> Bewbs
[2:07:38] <%Garthunox> does it?
[2:07:38] <%Valdorick> Tectonic shift.... yeah yeah.
[2:07:38] <@commanderclaw> Who cares? Yoko Taro doesn't
[2:07:39] <mr_saturday93> Did the androids built those skyscrapers?
[2:07:39] <+Rawowner333> idon't believe that????
[2:07:40] <%ringabal> Well, the robots have to start SOMEWHERE I GUESS
[2:07:43] <%Jaxnos> it's like gurren lagann
[2:07:44] <DickieWoodsmall_279> well the replicants had 800 years to go extinct
[2:07:44] <tattleworm> yeah, androids rebuilt the place
[2:07:44] <BlueLunecy> Maybe you're on top of the skyscrapers
[2:07:45] <%torusendor> Humanity takes SO LONG to die out
[2:07:45] <RubberFistFight> @boardscanada weiss is ender wiggin confirmed.
[2:07:46] <DagetStreams> Ah, you forgot that part
[2:07:46] <CatRidder> probably magic
[2:07:47] <%Garthunox> are you sure?
[2:07:48] <%maybefalco> the androids build them im pretty sure
[2:07:48] <+fetrigon> aliens
[2:07:49] <Teyaric> Isn't Automata like, thousands of years into a post re-unification timeline?
[2:07:49] <devanmuse> Tectonic plate movement?
[2:07:50] <zenith0111> Emils war with the Aliens was fucking nuts
[2:07:56] <KaitlynnHere> Yes, and?
[2:07:56] <%Aeogard> go back to the lost shrine and look around :)
[2:07:58] <+StatesmanPrimal> why is everyone spoiling suddenly?
[2:07:59] <Vertigheist> some stuff happened
[2:08:02] <%Jaxnos> no, seriously. it's like gurren lagann
[2:08:04] <dinnydanny777> Wizards did it
[2:08:06] <boardscanada> the part of that I just don't understand is that Weiss doesn't have a kid's face so it's just weird
[2:08:11] <OswaldTheDog> I was legit thinking about that last night - how does that happen?
[2:08:18] <boardscanada> kid's voice*
[2:08:19] <cubelock555> i allways thought automata takes place around the shadowlord's castle area
[2:08:20] <Djinnazz> @Aeogard Yeah, didn't he fight them by himself?
[2:08:30] <%The_Gaming_Karp> Ma'am this is a post office.
[2:08:33] <RubberFistFight> @torusendor lol yeah, this isn't a "saving the world" story, the world has already fucking died by this point. This is more like the twitchings of a corpse while the final pockets of cells slowly perish.
[2:08:38] <pixelkenj> :)
[2:08:39] <+fetrigon> LUL LUL LUL
[2:08:39] <cardamomo88> LUL LUL LUL
[2:08:41] <heartlesshealer> we'll get to Weiss lore later in-game
[2:08:41] <BlueLunecy> Hey wait
[2:08:42] <vapidq> wait I can't remember, what part of automata is that area?
[2:08:42] <feralspidey> is it?
[2:08:43] <%BestTeaMaker> no shutup tend the lighthouse
[2:08:43] <BlueLunecy> You're right
[2:08:45] <+Rawowner333> so....it's the same map? has that been confirmed?
[2:08:46] <heartlesshealer> LUL
[2:08:46] <BlueLunecy> What the fuck
[2:08:47] <Willfordbrimly> Does anyone else get Lost Odyssey vibes from this remake?
[2:08:50] <dinnydanny777> LUL
[2:08:51] <%cvp5127> LUL
[2:08:52] <+senfood> I can't be the only one who wants the next game to be set during the  13th Crusade.
[2:08:52] <%Aeogard> it is... here!
[2:08:53] <%maybefalco> holy shit you're right
[2:09:00] <%Valdorick> Humans are creatures of habit.
[2:09:00] <%RetroCop87> it's a darkhouse
[2:09:01] <%maybefalco> there's literally no need for a lighthouse
[2:09:03] <%Spydurman> BACK TO THE LIGHTHOUSE MINES OLD WOMAN
[2:09:04] <%Aeogard> back to slavign at the lighthouse
[2:09:06] <+Rawowner333> the rotation has already stopped?
[2:09:07] <+D00msDayDan> @vapidq the desert in automata is the same desert
[2:09:08] <cardamomo88> buy why?¡¡¡¡¡
[2:09:08] <heartlesshealer> perfect yell <3
[2:09:11] <RubberFistFight> @feralspidey yes, most of the planet is uninhabitable, only a thin belt around the equator is left afaik.
[2:09:12] <zenith0111> Lighthouses are meant to signal storms not just night time stuff
[2:09:14] <%moogleboy1984> m6kwRage
[2:09:15] <+senfood> ooh my god he's right
[2:09:15] <%The_Gaming_Karp> Lighthouses are just too advanced a science for everyone else
[2:09:16] <%Valdorick> A bayside down needs a lighthouse, therefore, someone needs to tend a lighthouse.
[2:09:17] <KaitlynnHere> I mean...
[2:09:17] <+StatesmanPrimal> @senfood the 13th black crusade?
[2:09:18] <mr_saturday93> I'd say the world is on life support and nier just made sure it stayed dead
[2:09:19] <%ringabal> "Ignite the First Flame, Oldbag!"
[2:09:19] <%Maids4lyfe> @senfood isn't that just drakengard? LUL
[2:09:20] <Sypheck> why not just train someone to work the lighthouse? LUL
[2:09:29] <Ninoace> LUL
[2:09:34] <+fetrigon> ⚒️ SEIZE THE MEANS OF PRODUCTION ⚒️
[2:09:36] <%bread_assassin> For when it’s REAL cloudy? I dunno, man.
[2:09:37] <Devbob98> Kaine the lighthouse keeper
[2:09:39] <vapidq> @vapidq oh, you're right, i forgot about the facade masks, that's weird
[2:09:40] <%Spydurman> @Sypheck not fuck dat bitch
[2:09:43] <dinnydanny777> why can't she just show them what to flick
[2:09:44] <KaitlynnHere> @sypheck no one knows how it works
[2:09:45] <%Spydurman> naw*
[2:09:50] <heartlesshealer> Automata/Stage Play
[2:09:50] <%RetroCop87> Pat, what are the odds you check out Drakengard 3 with the FPS fix?
[2:09:50] <zenith0111> OH
[2:09:51] <tattleworm> it's where taro said accord's hanging out, i think
[2:09:51] <%Valdorick> THE KINGDOM OF NIGHT IS RAD, GIVE A GAME IN THE KINGDOM OF NIGHT
[2:09:52] <Daxalog> Arx Fatalis
[2:09:57] <mr_saturday93> It's nier automata that the kingdom of night is mentioned
[2:09:58] <zenith0111> Setting for Nier 3?
[2:10:01] <+Birdigalore> Yeah that's where Accord is hiding from us
[2:10:02] <Willfordbrimly> Kingdom of Night is mentioned in Automata, implied to be where Accord is hanging out IIRC
[2:10:04] <boardscanada> isn't that whole 'it can never turn night' just an excuse for the game not having a working day-night cycle?
[2:10:04] <%Garthunox> Accord is trapped in the Kingdom of Night
[2:10:06] <%za7az> Wouldn't everything just die without sunlight?
[2:10:07] <+cade_calrayn> wait, the planet's rotation's fucked up? really?
[2:10:09] <%Jaxnos> and on that side? Lost Planet.
[2:10:10] <%Aeogard> yeah we hardly hear about anything regarding the other side of the world, it would be so cool to see
[2:10:11] <%bread_assassin> Accord is chilling there.
[2:10:11] <KaitlynnHere> That sounds badass
[2:10:12] <dinnydanny777> Ansem's hanging out down there
[2:10:13] <Ultimatefool> Mysterious as the dark side of... the EARTHHHH
[2:10:16] <%MisterRockett> OOoooh I forogt the reason for the apocolypse was that the planet basically stopped rotating.
[2:10:21] <cardamomo88> so cool
[2:10:23] <+senfood> @Maids4lyfe Nah, I'm talking about a prequel to Nier and what Pat's talking about with Red Eye.
[2:10:24] <%debugdrawray_> would be a good setting for the next nier, unless yoko branches off again
[2:10:24] <zenith0111> True
[2:10:24] <%RetroCop87> it would make a great stage play, don't ya think?
[2:10:26] <Willfordbrimly> I hope Yoko Taro makes a new game featuring my wife, Accord
[2:10:27] <Ninoace> Accord's over in the Kingdom of the Night
[2:10:28] <heartlesshealer> Magic fucking Solar-Locked the planet when Angelus died
[2:10:31] <Vertigheist> it's prob not as cool as it sounds tbh
[2:10:34] <KaitlynnHere> So... why is the world not spinning?
[2:10:41] <Kain5707> Pat did you enjoy the Woolie 14 stream?
[2:10:42] <+Rawowner333> oh
[2:10:43] <+BIumen> yeah there's like a deliciously-yoko taro story about child soldiers in there
[2:10:44] <%Jay_Squirrel> so like the moon with us?
[2:10:44] <DickieWoodsmall_279> it rotates SLOWER
[2:10:46] <mr_saturday93> I think that whole shit with red eye needs to be an anime
[2:10:47] <BlueLunecy> Ask for more content, not to connect it together, but to see the rad shit that is mentioned
[2:10:47] <+cade_calrayn> If the planet stopped rotating, everyone would be fucking roasted to death or they'd freeze to death
[2:10:49] <%RetroCop87> the axis shifted
[2:10:51] <yourliteraldog> Literal Magic
[2:10:54] <+senfood> @KaitlynnHere A "thing" happened
[2:10:57] <%Valdorick> Yeah, Nier Accord is hanging out in the Kingdom of Night, because YoRHa doesn't operate down there.
[2:10:58] <boardscanada> agreed, I'd like to see a 'prequel' game taking place before father/brother nier and yonah take refuge in that abandoned shop and cover the whole Legion story
[2:11:00] <Djinnazz> @PatStaresAt Wasn't it because we set off a bunch of nukes?
[2:11:01] <dinnydanny777> So how are there waves? limesThink
[2:11:02] <+StatesmanPrimal> essentially yeah, like the moon with us
[2:11:04] <CappuccinoGuil> Wait, how did that happened to the world?
[2:11:04] <zenith0111> Like if it spinned at just the right time in its orbit to stay facing the same way
[2:11:13] <Willfordbrimly> Maybe the planet has those giant ocean pits like from Deus Ex to keep it cool
[2:11:14] <%The_Gaming_Karp> Chlorination?
[2:11:14] <OswaldTheDog> science!
[2:11:16] <heartlesshealer> Moon orbit is uncertain, but the same face of the planet is always towards the sun by the time NieR occurs
[2:11:16] <+BIumen> could just be magic
[2:11:16] <Ultimatefool> That sounds like it should incinerate all plant life
[2:11:16] <%bread_assassin> How did that happen anyways?
[2:11:21] <KaitlynnHere> Ooooh
[2:11:22] <+SilverDevilfish> Thanks Moooom
[2:11:23] <RubberFistFight> @zenith0111 yeah pretty much.
[2:11:25] <+cade_calrayn> If one side of the planet is always facing the sun, it'd be roasted
[2:11:25] <HeroToxiko> @KaitlynnHere literally All the nukes
[2:11:25] <%RetroCop87> that bridge over there made it out fine
[2:11:26] <+StatesmanPrimal> we started using magic super weapons and shot
[2:11:28] <yourliteraldog> Essentially End of Evagelion happened then stephen kings the stand
[2:11:29] <+Rawowner333> shit. i thought that happened with the aliens
[2:11:30] <%solracc25> doesn't rotate on its own axis?
[2:11:31] <DickieWoodsmall_279> everyone coughed at the same time
[2:11:32] <+senfood> There were multiple cataclysms during the war againt the Legion.
[2:11:33] <SlimeSlimeSlime> The watchers watched it all.
[2:11:35] <%king_wragles> War against Chloronation?
[2:11:36] <%SunnyVarietyPack> Doesn
[2:11:39] <Devbob98> The seal
[2:11:40] <mr_saturday93> Ok seriously wtf is wrong with twitch mobile? it keeps on repeating the last 2 seconds every minute
[2:11:40] <%king_wragles> What did I miss?
[2:11:42] <+CursedNobleman> is this laharl?
[2:11:42] <%Spydurman> how do you fight the Salt World Holocaust coating the world
[2:11:45] <cardamomo88> NotLikeThis NotLikeThis
[2:11:46] <KaitlynnHere> Since when we’re nukes a bad thing?
[2:11:49] <dinnydanny777> limesFeels this is sad
[2:11:52] <heartlesshealer> war against The Sound
[2:11:55] <boardscanada> it was basically the coronavirus with a 100% mortality rate
[2:11:58] <%arcielardor> Shouldn't the planet be basically a hot pocket? Partially frozen and partially molten?
[2:12:02] <HeroToxiko> if the planet wasn't spinning yes that side would be roasted
[2:12:03] <heartlesshealer> also enjoy this quest
[2:12:03] <+davidwave4_> Weiss having no empathy for anyone is never not hilarious
[2:12:04] <SlimeSlimeSlime> Weiss XD
[2:12:04] <RubberFistFight> @Ultimatefool it does, on the light side. But a tidally locked planet would theoretically have a very thin habitable band right on the edge of the light/dark hemispheres.
[2:12:11] <heartlesshealer> it's a very good quest
[2:12:12] <+StatesmanPrimal> it was a magical disease that infected like 95%of the world population
[2:12:16] <tattleworm> wcs was choose to become a monster or die instantly
[2:12:16] <+senfood> I wanna know who that android was who woke up Red Eyes in Jeruselam.
[2:12:17] <dinnydanny777> Holy shit weiss LUL
[2:12:28] <%The_Gaming_Karp> "If Earth were tidally locked, there would be no seasons. The only change in the amount of sunlight would come from the slight variation in distance from the sun due to Earth’s orbit being slightly out of round. Instead of seasons I suspect there would be zones of different climates depending how far away you are from the center of the side that always faces the sun. Right on the equator of the sun-facing side, I would expect very high temperatures."
[2:12:28] <zenith0111> Weiss is right tho we got to focus on Yonah
[2:12:30] <Djinnazz> @KaitlynnHere since they didn't work, and they made the salt proplem a billion times worse.
[2:12:33] <Zerud> @king_wragles there is a huge story not told between drakengard ending E and Nier, basically the world went to a fuck against zombies created by the white chlorination
[2:12:33] <%Spydurman> magic viruses are terrifying
[2:12:34] <yourliteraldog> Who was red eye again
[2:12:43] <LunarRemix> Does anyone in this game have the idea to just leave this general area and go somewhere else without the Shades? Like across the ocean?
[2:12:49] <+fetrigon> get a girl pregnant and give birth to a lighthouse worker. EZ
[2:12:52] <%ringabal> BioCurses don't fuck around
[2:12:54] <%solracc25> Somewhere out there there is a line with light on one side and dark the other
[2:12:55] <Archmortal> I think one of my favorite realizations in Automata was the point when their eyes started lighting up red
[2:13:02] <RubberFistFight> @HeroToxiko the problem is that because its tidally locked, its rotation has changed so much that despite it continuing to spin, it's doing so at a rate that ensures one side ALWAYS faces the sun. It's like how the moon is tidally locked to us. Orbital and rotational mechanics is crazt.
[2:13:05] <RubberFistFight> crazy*
[2:13:08] <+Rawowner333> shades  are everywhere?
[2:13:11] <zenith0111> Thats complicated LUL
[2:13:12] <%torusendor> They do
[2:13:28] <%The_Gaming_Karp> Also oceans in a large part of the planet would be extremely stormy due to the high termperature.
[2:13:29] <%RetroCop87> is that established?
[2:13:31] <heartlesshealer> there's a reason there's a whole fucking desert right near these villages and fields
[2:13:37] <%ringabal> So what you're saying is this is Yoko Taro's One Pirece?
[2:13:37] <DickieWoodsmall_279> the equator or the meridian?
[2:13:39] <+BIumen> Also the "people in charge" probably make sure no one gets too out of line
[2:13:42] <%solracc25> Nier planet is flat
[2:13:45] <%arcielardor> even in your balls?
[2:13:45] <HeroToxiko> @HeroToxiko thats legitimately bonkers
[2:13:45] <%thelaxinator> Wait, so the Grand Line from One Piece is in effect?
[2:13:46] <SlimeSlimeSlime> How about the moon? I heard it's nice there.
[2:13:49] <tattleworm> stuff with the twins in automata says as much, yeah
[2:13:49] <mr_saturday93> Well that's a problem if they had ships with sails but a flying future machine?
[2:13:50] <DagetStreams> Pfft, semantics
[2:13:51] <Daxalog> Just find the One Piece
[2:13:52] <dinnydanny777> How is there an ocean if its tidally locked to the sun? limesThink
[2:13:53] <brainflint> just row your boat duh
[2:13:57] <+Kindan55> Yeah, Automata confirms that there are other regions with overseers looking over the shades.
[2:13:59] <Paranoid_Jumbotron> didnt the chlorification stuff hit china like immediately after the bombs?
[2:14:01] <RubberFistFight> @SlimeSlimeSlime Kappa
[2:14:08] <cardamomo88> SHE IS OLD DUDE
[2:14:13] <%za7az> @RetroCop87 Yes, once their origin is revealed
[2:14:14] <%Garthunox> SHITS FUCKED essentially
[2:14:21] <Zerud> @Paranoid_Jumbotron yep
[2:14:26] <+StatesmanPrimal> @dinnydanny777 it would still exist if the ocean was within the habitable zone
[2:14:27] <Visorak6> "come back tomorrow, she might be dead by then so it wont be a problem"
[2:14:28] <%Spydurman> LET THAT BITCH DIE UP THERE
[2:14:28] <DickieWoodsmall_279> she hasn't been plugged in for awhile
[2:14:30] <Djinnazz> @Paranoid_Jumbotron it hit everywhere after the bombs
[2:14:30] <%Maids4lyfe> what is wrong with these people
[2:14:31] <heartlesshealer> the ocean is probably secretly a lake, or earth really just had *that* much water
[2:14:33] <%Spydurman> what an asshole
[2:14:34] <boardscanada> someone had a good take that Emil just freezing everyone was a much better idea of preserving the humans instead of the Gestalt project
[2:14:35] <%solracc25> Old People die
[2:14:35] <Archmortal> did we already explain what exactly Chlorinization is?  Cuz that shit is LIT
[2:14:36] <%Pappajimbo> if it was at the edge of the habital areas should it be eternally twilight?
[2:14:38] <%SunnyVarietyPack> wait what does tidally locked even mean
[2:14:40] <+Rawowner333> go back to the post office
[2:14:40] <%RetroCop87> go back to POSTMAN
[2:14:41] <tattleworm> @PatStaresAt go back into the post office
[2:14:41] <$Ziegsy> OH I REMEMBER THIS
[2:14:47] <dinnydanny777> @statesmanprimal But the moon controls the tides? limesThink
[2:14:47] <jbrachob> he wants to bang the old lady
[2:14:49] <squeakyclarinet> Back to the POST OFFICE
[2:14:54] <+JustToWatch> you can't assume that thing about the temperatures is actually happening. There's literal magic, maybe it's magically redistributing the heat or some bullshit
[2:14:55] <%linSP> yeah post guy
[2:14:57] <RubberFistFight> @Kindan55 what's funny is the regions all experience more or less the same failures over and over again, but nobody in charge wants to/can admit this is all futile, so they just keep plugging away at an unsolveable problem. Good thing a pair of scapegoats showed up eventually.
[2:14:57] <%ringabal> Postman! I desire your strongest posts!
[2:14:57] <tattleworm> you're welcome!
[2:15:01] <squeakyclarinet> shit that was close...
[2:15:03] <%Spydurman> she's so old I bet she had a Playstation 1 Kappa
[2:15:04] <%solracc25> book insight
[2:15:05] <+cade_calrayn> welll apparently it's all because of Nier's shoestring budget, they couldn't do a day/night cycle so they made up the tidal lock stuff as an excuse
[2:15:10] <%Garthunox> pat...
[2:15:16] <%Garthunox> go to the post office
[2:15:20] <+bassoontyphoon> That was super clear
[2:15:23] <heartlesshealer> tidally locked originally refers to the moon, but it's the closest descriptor to what's happening with earth's facing towards the sun
[2:15:27] <+Buddy_Bison> Which Clemps video(s) should I watch to get the full picture?
[2:15:29] <%BoxNavy> gottem
[2:15:29] <%The_Gaming_Karp> Mr. Postman refuses to accept mortality.
[2:15:30] <Paranoid_Jumbotron> YOOOOO
[2:15:35] <+senfood> So this timeline deals with an intermensional incursion, a zombie apocalypse, a sentient android rebelllion and an alien invasion. Nier universe confirmed for Futurama.
[2:15:37] <boardscanada> you'd simply freeze every human, wait a thousand years until WCS particles are all gone, then have the androids unfreeze the humans again and you wouldn't have the whole screwed up gestalt relapses
[2:15:39] <%Pappajimbo> also there would be constant winds from the sun side
[2:15:41] <%solracc25> Mail crimes
[2:15:42] <%Garthunox> that was clearer than anything
[2:15:43] <cardamomo88> OH
[2:15:54] <Paranoid_Jumbotron> @Buddy_Bison drakenguard 1 then chronologically
[2:15:56] <heartlesshealer> All drakengard/nier clemps videos. But especially the stageplays if you're looking only for kingdom of night
[2:15:57] <cardamomo88> POSTAL FRAUD
[2:15:58] <Tuna_Can_0> Does the moon still rotate around the earth??
[2:16:01] <%Garthunox> GOTTEM
[2:16:08] <Jaysky> Cwap
[2:16:14] <+StatesmanPrimal> Chloronization is a disease wherein you are infected and a "God" gives you a choice; serve or die. if you serve you become a horrific zombie, if you refuse you turn to salt and die horribly
[2:16:15] <Visorak6> A GUN
[2:16:15] <CappuccinoGuil> A BODY?!
[2:16:19] <+Rawowner333> puzzle time
[2:16:21] <Jaysky> A puzzle!?
[2:16:23] <DickieWoodsmall_279> and she NEVER noticed
[2:16:23] <%solracc25> Fake letters. Mail crimes
[2:16:23] <%Jay_Squirrel> yeah grab that black pearl
[2:16:25] <KaitlynnHere> Uuuuhhhhh
[2:16:30] <%The_Gaming_Karp> Is this gun yourrrs?
[2:16:32] <heartlesshealer> time for boxes
[2:16:33] <%ringabal> GRISHA'S NOTEBOOK!?
[2:16:34] <+Birdigalore> BEHOLD MY LABRYNTH OF POSTAGE
[2:16:34] <RubberFistFight> @boardscanada isn't there a reason established why they can't do that? Something about the bodies continuing to break down in stasis because of the magical nature of the disease?

[2:16:39] <DagetStreams> There's something you should see. MY PUZZLE, IDIOT!
[2:16:44] <Paranoid_Jumbotron> pat do a puzzle
[2:16:45] <zenith0111> @boardscanada Thats assuming everyone cooperates
[2:16:49] <RubberFistFight> like, the gestalt/replicant program was literally THE ONLY solution and it wasn't even workable.
[2:16:50] <%The_Gaming_Karp> The boxes ruin the moment a little.
[2:16:51] <heartlesshealer> boxes stacked high to prevent jumping
[2:16:56] <yourliteraldog> yoy fucked it
[2:16:59] <%solracc25> Boxes, the bane of all books
[2:17:01] <DickieWoodsmall_279> it's a good thing nier has eyes in the ceiling because this puzzle would be impossible for anyone else
[2:17:01] <OswaldTheDog> what’s with these games and pushing minigames
[2:17:07] <Archmortal> @StatesmanPrimal and the best part is, you only even get that choice if you've got exceptionally strong willpower or some shit, so most people just turn to salt regardless
[2:17:10] <+LionKagura> pat just reset it

[2:17:11] <boardscanada> @RubberFistFight I'm not sure, I'm not 100% clued in on all the lore but from what I understand of the story, they did the whole petrification experimentation way before Gestalt

[2:20:45] <%cvp5127> why
[2:20:46] <$Ziegsy> @Tuna_Can_0 Tidal locking results in the Moon rotating about its axis in about the same time it takes to orbit Earth.

[2:21:19] <%The_Gaming_Karp> The ultimate catfishing.
[2:21:20] <supergoblinpunch> your daddy a bitch
[2:21:20] <Volkrotia> I think Weiss says this later in the game [no spoilers] Sometimes False Hope is better than no hope
[2:21:21] <+RoeDeerRootie> why do they need a lighthouse if it's always day
[2:21:22] <+Kindan55> This is definitely a hard choice. I told her though.
[2:21:22] <OswaldTheDog> that’s really terrible
[2:21:24] <DickieWoodsmall_279> @Zeigsy no that's geocentric orbit, tidal lock is when one side is always facing the parent body
[2:21:27] <+CursedNobleman> RAZE THE TOWN
[2:21:28] <+bassoontyphoon> 50 YEARS??!?
[2:21:28] <%SunnyVarietyPack> well... thats up to you
[2:21:28] <Sypheck> everyone in Seafront is a shit
[2:21:29] <KaitlynnHere> Well she only has to think about it for like ten seconds before she dies
[2:21:31] <+D00msDayDan> even the children must have been in on it
[2:21:31] <+CursedNobleman> RAZE IT TO THE GROUND
[2:21:42] <%solracc25> Kids grew up keeping this lie
[2:21:50] <yourliteraldog> Burn the town

[2:21:53] <+StatesmanPrimal> Man fuck delivering that letter
[2:21:57] <%Spydurman> burn the town to the ground so the lighthouse isn't needed anymore Kappa
[2:21:58] <OswaldTheDog> Honey, the right thing should have been done 50 years ago
[2:21:58] <NireFuster> Is this game new? I know nothing about Nier so I have no idea what's even going on
[2:21:59] <+CursedNobleman> DESTROY THE CITY
[2:22:00] <+Vigonept> pass the burden to the kid
[2:22:00] <Zebroneath> This town sucks
[2:22:01] <battlexqueen> Tbh i wouldnt want to die feeling like they were alive somewhere and never able to see them again
[2:22:02] <$Ziegsy> this game scewed my moral compass as a kid
[2:22:04] <Tuna_Can_0> @Ziegsy ?? Im a little dense, but if its constantly day, and the moon rotates. Tides wouldn't be locked. If the moon doesn't orbit it would collide with earth
[2:22:06] <cardamomo88> ANOTHER SHITTY PLACE
[2:22:07] <+skyheys> what a HUGE BITCH
[2:22:10] <+D00msDayDan> dont get your jowls in a froth
[2:22:11] <%Jay_Squirrel> well shes gonna die anyway, why let her die sad
[2:22:12] <+eanscrale> Dude you're like 14 isn't this like A LOT
[2:22:13] <+xxx420stoat69xxx> the moral choice here is to lie
[2:22:15] <%solracc25> It's very unlikely that children wouldn't let it slip
[2:22:20] <dinnydanny777> This woman has spent 50 years believing her lover was still alive
[2:22:23] <$StrawberryPantsu> TELL HER
[2:22:23] <KaitlynnHere> Tell her the truth so she can die in agony
[2:22:27] <%The_Gaming_Karp> Wow this is horrible
[2:22:30] <%BoxNavy> no

[2:22:32] <Zebroneath> NO
[2:22:39] <DickieWoodsmall_279> @Tuna_Can_0 the moon still orbits and the tides aren't locked

[2:22:48] <%Aeogard> the depression sets in early
[2:22:50] <+D00msDayDan> @Tuna_Can_0 tidally locked means one side of the planet is permanently facing the planet it's orbiting, like the moon is tidally locked to earth
[2:22:51] <$StrawberryPantsu> BUT SHE WASNT
[2:22:52] <yourliteraldog> Lost dick
[2:22:52] <wolfen091> HARDCORE

[2:23:08] <seithri> coulda ridden the cock carousal for 50 years!

[2:23:43] <Crimpson> But she is ok with it
[2:23:43] <%ElkRiverDog> I wanna know who she pissed off that they thought this crap up
[2:23:50] <heartlesshealer> yes
[2:23:52] <Archmortal> Do you think 50 years was enough for someone else to fucking learn how to man the lighthouse?

[2:24:01] <%RetroCop87> this is not a bad end, the quest treats this like the better ending
[2:24:03] <yourliteraldog> Kill em all nier
[2:24:04] <$Ziegsy> @Tuna_Can_0 the moon isnt a sphere, so as it turns the shape causes the gravitational pull to change. Like lumpy bit closer is higher pull
[2:24:05] <%Spydurman> 50 FUCKING YEARSSSSS
[2:24:05] <+CursedNobleman> fuck this town and fuck this lighthouse
[2:24:05] <dinnydanny777> They rationalised this because no one else can man the lighthouse NotLikeThis
[2:24:06] <Crimpson> She forgives them
[2:24:06] <+davidwave4_> Oh gee golly, she's gonna die
[2:24:07] <Devbob98> Kill the town
[2:24:09] <%solracc25> How can it be a single handwriting
[2:24:10] <%Valdorick> She'll throw herself off the tower now.

[2:24:11] <Vertigheist> @Crimpson acceptance is the last step

[2:24:24] <+bassoontyphoon> KILL THEM ALL PETER
[2:24:24] <+Birdigalore> NO!  THEY DID SO TO SPARE THEMSELVES AN AWKWARD SITUATION
[2:24:27] <+StatesmanPrimal> this is the better ending, because she accepts what happened
[2:24:28] <KaitlynnHere> Did they
[2:24:30] <%acridpaladin> naw heck the town. knock down the lighthouse as you die
[2:24:31] <+CursedNobleman> SwiftRage LET THIS SHIT DOWN SUFFER.

[2:24:32] <dinnydanny777> no limesFeels limesFeels limesFeels
[2:24:33] <RubberFistFight> @ElkRiverDog it was literally that they didn't want her to leave because she was the only one who knew how to run the lighthouse, and they couldn't be bothered teaching anyone else how to do it.
[2:24:33] <%Spydurman> push the town down the stairs one by one
[2:24:34] <Crimpson> @Crimpson yeah. I did this mission and selected to tell her
[2:24:34] <mr_saturday93> honestly this side is quest is fucked
[2:24:36] <Ultimatefool> Was NieR the real sadness trilogy all along? Can David Cage learn from this?
[2:24:38] <%torusendor> They did
[2:24:40] <supergoblinpunch> I will now rig the towns with explosives
[2:24:42] <RubberFistFight> the people in this world are all GAARRRBBAAAAGE.

[2:24:48] <RubberFistFight> it's just what kind of garbage they are that differs.
[2:24:48] <Sypheck> this lady should've opened a can of whoopass on this shit town

[2:24:50] <tattleworm> you'll see, but you're wrong about that
[2:24:52] <%RetroCop87> this quest still has one last part left after you talk to Devola
[2:24:56] <DickieWoodsmall_279> "people"
[2:24:56] <CappuccinoGuil> MORALLY GREY
[2:24:57] <$Ziegsy> @Tuna_Can_0 if the moon is synced to the earth, so the same face is always facing the earth, theres no change in the pull, so the tides no longer become affected
[2:24:59] <Djinnazz> Eh
[2:24:59] <yourliteraldog> I'd be banging on pots and pans calling the whole town shit.
[2:24:59] <+senfood> I don't think they're monsters. They're just human.
[2:25:00] <%Jaxnos> turns out the mean old hag was the best person in the town
[2:25:01] <NireFuster> "Oh you robbed me of all my life, but you worked so hard on your lies! So thank you!"
[2:25:03] <+Birdigalore> I'm glad humanity gets wiped out! LOL
[2:25:04] <cardamomo88> GO POISEN THE WATER
[2:25:11] <%ClericOfSparda> They robbed her, and she just took it on the chin
[2:25:19] <Visorak6> "Can you tell me where they are?"
[2:25:20] <Visorak6> "No"
[2:25:24] <+StatesmanPrimal> the japanese thing of, we don't want to inconvenience ourselves
[2:25:25] <RubberFistFight> @PatStaresAt "Theyre fine but they had to go on a business trip to Pluto, they'll be back soon."
[2:25:25] <+Rawowner333> you have to leave the  town for the last bit
[2:25:27] <DickieWoodsmall_279> @senfood "human"
[2:25:29] <%RetroCop87> talk to Devola one last time
[2:25:30] <%ElkRiverDog> I personally would have mounted a cannon on top of that lighthouse and started taking pot shots
[2:25:34] <Crimpson> Yeah, but imagine if they just left her go to find out that her love never existed
[2:25:36] <Archmortal> @RubberFistFight Nier is up there with the most garbage of all when you read his backstory and how he kinda suspects what Shades are
[2:25:37] <%Valdorick> "Look, we got him on line right now" slightly lowers voices "Hey toots, hows it hanging babe?"
[2:25:38] <%Jay_Squirrel> its why telling someone with a kidnapped loved one "i promise theyll come back" is extremely fucked
[2:25:38] <snivins> is that a jApanaese mentality thing=?
[2:25:39] <%VoidBaronJules> VoidBaronJules subscribed at Tier 1. They've subscribed for 6 months, currently on a 6 month streak! 6 months LET'S GOOOO!!!!!!
[2:25:39] <heartlesshealer> go back to her
[2:25:40] <%solracc25> I would have set the post on fire
[2:25:43] <tattleworm> this remake's a little too faithful sometimes
[2:25:43] <dinnydanny777> Its worse because they pretended he was alive limesCry
[2:25:45] <+StatesmanPrimal> sorry, the human thing of we don't want to inconvenience ourselves
[2:25:47] <vapidq> @NireFuster it's pretty awful, reminds me of that yakuza 6 side quest where they lie to that girl
[2:25:47] <OswaldTheDog> I don’t think they’re monsters - I think they’re just people who made a really really bad choice
[2:25:47] <%Deft_Thought> Just gonna go get some milk from the store
[2:25:49] <%curiour> community stockholm syndrome is a hell of a thing
[2:25:50] <RubberFistFight> @StatesmanPrimal something something social fabric, nail that sticks out gets hammered down, etc.
[2:25:52] <%Deft_Thought> For 50 years
[2:25:54] <Baeltyr> @snivins  maybe, who knows
[2:25:55] <+senfood> @DickieWoodsmall_279 You know what I mean!
[2:25:55] <+Birdigalore> Japanese forgiveness is the most powerful jogo
[2:25:58] <+SouLucha> Yeah, the old lady should hit the secret lighthouse self-destruct button and let the it fall on the town.
[2:26:04] <%RetroCop87> yup alup ala
[2:26:04] <+cade_calrayn> Granted I think it was really just the postman and his father, not the whole town
[2:26:09] <+Vigonept> pfft
[2:26:11] <blackbookalpha> I remember finishing this quest and I heard a kid say "this sucks" as I ran to the post office
[2:26:11] <%Valdorick> Eat shit Nierman!
[2:26:12] <DomonTrigger> I feel like the game isn't even really saying that thats the right thing to do
[2:26:15] <%solracc25> Pig drift
[2:26:17] <%The_Gaming_Karp> Now I want papadams
[2:26:17] <Ultimatefool> TONE WHIPLASH

[2:26:21] <%RetroCop87> hot boar-on-doe action
[2:26:23] <$Ziegsy> old lady pisses on the lighthouse controls so no one can use it again
[2:26:25] <vapidq> @cade_calrayn the postman says the whole town agreed to it
[2:26:31] <Jaysky> When there's a treat bag yeah
[2:26:32] <KaitlynnHere> @cade_calrayn no he said the whole town was in on it
[2:26:36] <heartlesshealer> have to head out for deliveries, have fun with world of blood, sunshine, and sadness!
[2:26:36] <%Deft_Thought> Pretty rude that you're making Kaine run after you instead of letting her ride
[2:26:37] <dinnydanny777> The boar looks like it's sped up LUL
[2:26:38] <maybe_tired> that thing is so fast it's dumb
[2:26:41] <Devbob98> Kaine would’ve killed postman
[2:26:44] <RubberFistFight> @Archmortal oh yeah. About the only people who aren't complete pieces of shit are Emil, and the twins, and it's for VERY specific reasons. They're a little grey, sure, but holy shit they're nowhere near as morally bankrupt as the rest of the people.
[2:26:55] <+SouLucha> Oh no.. Let's all compare war crimes now...
[2:26:59] <+LandOfTheWay> the town might not be monsters per se, but they're definitely fuckups
[2:27:06] <DickieWoodsmall_279> @Ziegsy she sprays viscous old person fluid and gets the controls stuck
[2:27:11] <+Birdigalore> Oooooh I think he likes you <3
[2:27:12] <Sypheck> what a mysterious quest
[2:27:13] <zenith0111> :(
[2:27:15] <dinnydanny777> Is that Cockerel the same noise the Cuccos make in Ocarina of Time?
[2:27:16] <vapidq> @DomonTrigger kinda is when the grandma says they worked hard to make her happy
[2:27:16] <Tuna_Can_0> @Ziegsy ah ok I see
[2:27:18] <+StatesmanPrimal> we're comparing war crimes? apriPoggers
[2:27:24] <+BIumen> devola is like "oo a secret postman murder letter, sploosh"
[2:27:31] <mr_saturday93> How does nier not find the twins hot af?

[2:27:35] <DomonTrigger> Well yeah but thats just the grandma
[2:27:36] <%Arancet> it absolutely is

[2:28:04] <OswaldTheDog> @landoftheway exactly
[2:28:05] <%The_Gaming_Karp> I always here the Morrowind door sound
[2:28:06] <Archmortal> @RubberFistFight even accounting for what the Twins are, them and Emil being the only people who carry forward into Automata and also being the only not-shit people in NieR  seems like it's not a coincidence
[2:28:07] <%Arancet> the pot smash sound effect has become so recognizable it upsets me when i hear it now
[2:28:10] <%The_Gaming_Karp> hear*
[2:28:11] <%RetroCop87> Pat, don't forget what the Old Lady told you when speaking to the postman
[2:28:11] <+ScrapSentinel> Man cultivating the White Moonflower is tedious without time shenanigans.
[2:28:14] <+StatesmanPrimal> the ending where you tell her is better. she gets closure and is able to forgive them
[2:28:18] <boardscanada> yeah whatever millions those budgets goes into, it sure isn't sound foliage
[2:28:19] <mimi777> didnt kaine f*ck a dead body in canon
[2:28:22] <%Garthunox> and the valve
[2:28:25] <hat_under_bread> Akshually, they're royalty-free, not public domain. You have to pay, like, $600 for the library.
[2:28:36] <dinnydanny777> @mimi777 What limesYikes
[2:28:38] <+senfood> @mimi777 Yuuuuup.

[2:28:44] <KaitlynnHere> Why? Why
[2:28:44] <Sypheck> yes
[2:28:45] <RubberFistFight> @Archmortal i mean, on the twins being in automata, i can't really say much else without spoiling so I won't. As for Emil, he's a victim first and foremost.
[2:28:49] <%Deft_Thought> @PatStaresAt I could swear that the supermarket Trader Joe's has the RE2 Menu sfx for the credit/debit card pad
[2:28:50] <+fetrigon> ah sick kermit
[2:28:50] <mimi777> yeh thats real
[2:28:50] <hat_under_bread> And it really is THE library. Because it's the cheapest one around.

[2:28:51] <$Ziegsy> @Tuna_Can_0 It can be hard to explain without visuals. It happens when the moon is rotating at the perfect speed so the earth is turning to match it. Its super wild.
[2:28:52] <%The_Gaming_Karp> Oh SHE's the pain!?
[2:28:53] <+StatesmanPrimal> I thought kaine just jacked off in canon?
[2:28:53] <boardscanada> videogames are rather cheap like that, spend millions on fancy graphics, spend $60 on sound

[2:29:33] <cardamomo88> NO FUCK YOU
[2:29:33] <shieldecho> ...It's the exact same dialogue if you tell him you told her the truth...
[2:29:33] <RubberFistFight> @StatesmanPrimal yeah in one of the stories, as someone on twitter put it "she got horny after killing shades and had to jack her fat meat".
[2:29:36] <+StatesmanPrimal> @landoftheway I thought it was her passenger doing that
[2:29:38] <heartlesshealer> oh, you lied to -them-. Good. Let them feel like assholes
[2:29:47] <%linSP> wow weiss, you're so wise
[2:29:48] <+Rawowner333> that's that
