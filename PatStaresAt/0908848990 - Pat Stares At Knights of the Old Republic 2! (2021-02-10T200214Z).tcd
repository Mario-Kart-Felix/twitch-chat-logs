[1:14:39] <%Alazull> What's up lizard jobber
[1:14:47] <@SSaryn> The true question is for how many credits can we sell him into slavery FOR?
[1:14:48] <sweetestbeefs> Droids are quite literally second class citizens in star wars
[1:15:07] <Manjove> @sweetestbeefs i would consider that a negative, i want consequences for my actions
[1:15:30] <Manjove> @BigDumBeak is your toaster a slave?
[1:15:50] <%Undenizen> @sweetestbeefs Droids are literally tools. They have the same rights as toasters.
[1:16:20] <Broken_Sonex> They got asses that won't quit
[1:16:23] <olaksi> sounds very morally grey
[1:16:30] <@SSaryn> Unlike Woolie Kappa

[1:16:37] <%Undenizen> @Manjove my toaster is a slave.
[1:16:42] <Broken_Sonex> @olaksi VERY morally grey
[1:16:42] <%Alazull> I wish you could recruit the Twin Suns as a Sith

[1:17:35] <%JJCheeker> I think that happens a lot here on this planet
[1:17:36] <sweetestbeefs> i replied to myself, I'm a moron.
[1:17:37] <%JoshManVGH> Back in time for fast talking lizard!
[1:17:38] <%Undenizen> honestly, if my toaster could talk, i'd remove that feature. I don't want my toaster to talk.
[1:17:40] <%SirGO0SE> I'm surprised Pat doesn't like Mira. She's a redhead, hot, and dumb.
[1:17:43] <Sotetsu> Hi, Pat! Hope youre day is getting better
[1:18:02] <Broken_Sonex> She's pretty hot with a big ass, but other than that, she's pretty eh

[1:20:07] <sweetestbeefs> and a sword that can cut through everything
[1:20:15] <Broken_Sonex> Hey, not to say I don't like Mira. I always pick her other than Hanhaar because she's nice to look at, plus more Jedi on your team.

[1:21:00] <TourettesPlays> @Broken_Sonex You can get free bonuses from Hanharr just by talking to him
[1:21:01] <GarbageQueenEllie> Who wouldn't want a crew full of hot Jedi ladies?
[1:21:03] <%Kitafin> good talk
[1:21:22] <robo_badger> That one was on them for being idiots
[1:21:23] <Broken_Sonex> @Broken_Sonex Yeah, but Mira's hot, so....
[1:21:38] <scrublordsamurai> i wish there were more weirdo aliens
[1:22:02] <%Undenizen> @GarbageQueenEllie I don't know if you're aware, but it's known that girls have a MUCH higher rate of both carrying AND transmitting cooties.

[1:22:09] <scrublordsamurai> they are pixels, who cares if theyre hot?
[1:22:16] <%Alazull> @PatStaresAt "I think we're reaching the point of the conversation where you start screaming and I make a lot of wee woo noises."

[1:27:25] <%bassoontyphoon> we'll bang ok?
[1:27:42] <GustauveVIII> @PatStaresAt Geeda gets extra inventory if you side with her, but only after you complete Onderon and its RNG. It *could* be good, but also really bad, so up to you

[1:28:10] <@commanderclaw> She sells good shit down the line, it's worth the light side points
[1:28:11] <sweetestbeefs> YOU HAVE TO UPGRADE HER SHOP
[1:28:16] <scrublordsamurai> BETRAYAL!
[1:28:17] <Too_Much_Nukie> This is one of THOSE quests where you run back and forth.
[1:28:29] <Goodvibes99508> it can get better later if you take her quest
[1:28:29] <TourettesPlays> Tell this guy to fuck off
[1:28:47] <Broken_Sonex> Back....and forward....the quest
[1:29:08] <GustauveVIII> @PatStaresAt have to go back and forth and get better offers, but she only gets more inventory if you come back after fully completing Onderon
[1:29:25] <TourettesPlays> Female Rodain is the only merchant on Nar Shadda that matters
[1:29:36] <Too_Much_Nukie> She also gets more inventory if you complete Dantooine, but only if you leave the Koohnda in charge.
[1:29:58] <sweetestbeefs> impulse control: the quest
[1:30:09] <Too_Much_Nukie> Note you won't ACTUALLY be blocked from trading with any merchants other than that guy.
[1:31:08] <KingChef37> It doesnt matter how you resolve the situations on dantooine and onderon
[1:31:08] <sweetestbeefs> "stablized" LUL
[1:31:17] <robo_badger> It is stable if no one is alive to destabilise it

[1:31:36] <Too_Much_Nukie> You'll get it on Malachor right before the final boss.
[1:31:39] <GarbageQueenEllie> Just quicksave before that over and over

[1:38:50] <Too_Much_Nukie> Yeah Batarians love slavery.
[1:38:54] <%Ranryu692> It would've been weird if they didn't have humans, though
[1:38:56] <%JoshManVGH> "These are the CRIME aliens"

[1:39:00] <%wibbwobbler> LUL
[1:39:04] <+theshinyhunterdom> Googled Batarian confirming would do the pew pew
[1:39:04] <GustauveVIII> one of them straight up fucking poisons you just because you're human
[1:39:05] <revoltingimp> I see no problems with this *refuels flamethrower*
[1:39:06] <GarbageQueenEllie> Vorcha are funny tho so they get a pass
[1:39:09] <%LetsBeBadAtVideoGames> They are aliens who ALWAYS pick the red prompt
[1:39:16] <Goodvibes99508> vorcha are barely sentient its not fair to call them evil
[1:39:31] <Too_Much_Nukie> Vorcha are worm colonies.
[1:39:34] <scrublordsamurai> i heard that the batarians said that all your moms are fat and stupid
[1:39:35] <panlakes> all batarian choices are renegade choices
[1:39:37] <olaksi> How about the aliens who run the galactic banking system
[1:39:46] <alroy900> a batarian bartender tries to poison you, and you can force him to drink it instead and watch him die

[1:41:47] <Sotetsu> Dog weight training
[1:41:53] <+theshinyhunterdom> And a bird
[1:42:08] <scrublordsamurai> whats up with all the actual racism, much shwme on you
[1:42:09] <Too_Much_Nukie> @Ipsenscastle Gungans are mostly a cool amphibious warrior race. It's JUST Jar-Jar. Even other Gungans hate him.
[1:42:10] <+theshinyhunterdom> One that repeats all your craziness
[1:42:13] <GarbageQueenEllie> @Too_Much_Nukie We need a fanart of Quarian!Esmeralda.
[1:42:30] <%Ipsenscastle> @Too_Much_Nukie that's actually super true, huh
[1:42:38] <Sotetsu> Now kiss
[1:42:39] <Too_Much_Nukie> Reminder that Jar-Jar got fucking banished.
[1:42:41] <%Puhff> Why lose when you can cheat?
[1:42:41] <Too_Much_Nukie> For being awful.
[1:42:43] <sweetestbeefs> @Too_Much_Nukie dont gungans speak in space-ebonics, though?
[1:42:58] <Too_Much_Nukie> No, but when they speak basic they do.
[1:43:03] <Too_Much_Nukie> They have their own language.
[1:43:05] <Broken_Sonex> WORDS ARE HARD FOR THE PAT
[1:43:14] <Sotetsu> Bad dog!
[1:43:33] <+gustavozxd> atpCap
[1:43:34] <Too_Much_Nukie> They like ending the "e" vowel sound with "sa"
[1:43:42] <+Ultimate_Edge> Zangief has learned protest
[1:43:43] <scrublordsamurai> there is a species literaly called SandPeople who would have guessed that star wars is racist
[1:43:49] <Sotetsu> Get a newspaper, roll it up, and then read him the want ads! That'll show him.
[1:44:02] <sweetestbeefs> oh god i fogot about the "sand people"
[1:44:07] <%Ipsenscastle> There's also a super racist-seeming alien in the casino in Last Jedi, but I can't describe it without being racist. It seemed real bad to me
[1:44:08] <Too_Much_Nukie> The Sand People are not called Sand People. They don't share any facts about themselves with aliens so that's what everyone calls them.
[1:44:17] <sweetestbeefs> that just scream and kill things and blow shit up...
[1:44:22] <Too_Much_Nukie> They're called Tuskens.
[1:45:01] <scrublordsamurai> who cares starwars sucks any way only good things are kotor and mandolorian
[1:45:06] <GarbageQueenEllie> If you're LS in Kotor 1, you can actually hear their oral history straight from the Tuskans themselves. It's pretty interesting.
[1:45:12] <Too_Much_Nukie> Tusken people attack everything on Tattooine because they see everyone who isn't one of them as a hostile invader to their planet.
[1:45:19] <GustauveVIII> i think its time for a save
[1:45:23] <Too_Much_Nukie> Have a very us-vs-everyone-else mentality.
[1:45:34] <%Ipsenscastle> Tuskens are cool and actually kind of justified, it's more that the colonists are racist against them, its pretty multifaceted for Star Wars
[1:45:49] <Too_Much_Nukie> And considering how much of a shithole Tattooine has become, I agree with the Tuskens.
[1:45:51] <sweetestbeefs> arent the tusken raiders an ancient primordial race, according to kotor 1?
[1:45:51] <scrublordsamurai> @too_much_nukie i get that but it was made up way later
[1:45:55] <Spudnacious_Dynasty> Yakuza has broken Woolie today.
[1:46:08] <Too_Much_Nukie> It wasn't tho. George was the one who came up with that lore.
[1:46:22] <Too_Much_Nukie> It just isn't in the movie. I think it even gets mentioned in the novelization of episode 7.
[1:46:26] <Too_Much_Nukie> 4 I mean.
[1:46:34] <Broken_Sonex> HOLY SHIT HE'S MORE BLIND THAN WOOLIE

[1:48:20] <Too_Much_Nukie> I hate this track.

[1:50:13] <theaceclaw> speed racer doesn't care who gets in between him and his goal. all he seems is the finish line.

[1:56:56] <%XeroSigmaPrime> WHAT DID T3 DO TO YOU!?
[1:56:59] <%bassoontyphoon> Can I speak to your manager???
[1:57:06] <%slimmixrp> You had more conversation options
[1:57:07] <+Gespens> I'd give T3 the dick too, tbh
[1:57:08] <%Ranryu692> you're allowed to be wrong, it's fine
[1:57:08] <Too_Much_Nukie> T3 is a good boy.
[1:57:10] <%slimmixrp> I'm pretty sure
[1:57:13] <%Teintstein> does the dick gun shoot bullets or dicks?
[1:57:14] <Manjove> no take backsies
[1:57:14] <sweetestbeefs> T3 IS THE BOY
[1:57:15] <%Huntercd> Just kill the merchant
[1:57:16] <TourettesPlays> Is it just because he's not HK?
[1:57:20] <$Invlux> Does the gun SHOOT dicks? or
[1:57:23] <Ralyks9117> love you pat
[1:57:29] <Ell1ot> what does a gun made of dicks use for ammo?
[1:57:32] <%Puhff> "roleplay"
[1:57:32] <+SolidusRex> But Pat, you ALWAYS roleplay a darkside character
[1:57:37] <Too_Much_Nukie> Just leave him.
[1:57:37] <sweetestbeefs> KILL
[1:57:37] <GarbageQueenEllie> Why would you hate him so much? He's just a dog
[1:57:38] <GustauveVIII> @PatStaresAt event doesnt happen until you get kidnapped
[1:57:38] <Sapphire_Breeze> "roleplaying"
[1:57:42] <Too_Much_Nukie> You will get him back later.
[1:57:43] <%bassoontyphoon> @Ell1ot Gamer goo
[1:57:43] <Sunstalker> Would you sell E-DE into slavery too? BibleThump
[1:57:44] <%XeroSigmaPrime> You wiped years of priceless information on Revan stored in T3
[1:57:54] <%MidnightBurst12> it's fine
[1:58:10] <scrublordsamurai> @sapphire_breeze in a single player game who cares?
[1:58:10] <%Arancet> i like that the crazy person is just running through a shopping mall brandishing two swords and twirling them
[1:58:11] <Broken_Sonex> "I'm gonna sell you off!" Who's gonna fly the ship? "DAMN IT!"
[1:58:49] <Sapphire_Breeze> @scrublordsamurai nobody, I was just making a joke that pat is evil for real when it comes to bullying T3 LUL
[1:58:54] <%Puhff> What about ME roboship lady?
[1:59:21] <%Huntercd> Give that wookie a lightsaber
[1:59:23] <%Ranryu692> Hanharr sucks lol
[1:59:23] <sweetestbeefs> i would gladly sell EDI into slavery in ME3
[1:59:32] <Too_Much_Nukie> Fun fact: this hutt model is the same one from Kotor 1.
[1:59:33] <scrublordsamurai> @sapphire_breeze t3 deserves it he is the real evilak
[1:59:33] <%bassoontyphoon> Hanharr is such a cinnamon bun
[1:59:36] <Too_Much_Nukie> Every hutt uses the same model.
[1:59:37] <GustauveVIII> hanharr is just so goddamn terrible
[1:59:50] <Sapphire_Breeze> hanharr with the scrubquotes
[2:00:00] <+OG_M_Bison> @GustauveVIII Like as a character?
[2:00:08] <%bassoontyphoon> Hanharr is like Kotal Kahn in that he should be super hype but just ends up as a total jobber
[2:00:23] <%slimmixrp> He is jedi by a quest
[2:00:24] <sweetestbeefs> you can kill a guy in this area now to do that, actually
[2:00:37] <GustauveVIII> @OG_M_Bison his entire characterization can be summed up as "IM ANGRY BECAUSE IM SAD"
[2:00:42] <%slimmixrp> Yummy jedi
[2:00:48] <Too_Much_Nukie> You might need to bring him with you in the refugee area once to trigger the event, but I'm not positive.
[2:00:53] <%Ipsenscastle> Eat them like Armie Hammer
[2:00:54] <sweetestbeefs> you just go to the refugee sector to activate the jedi quest
[2:00:56] <%slimmixrp> Jedi Jerky
[2:01:06] <%Ipsenscastle> Get that juicy Shaq meat
[2:01:10] <%bevyrage> delicious foice poynts
[2:01:16] <%slimmixrp> @Too_Much_Nukie The events happens when you *don't* bring him with you
[2:01:40] <waywardhavoc> this is hot
[2:02:05] <sweetestbeefs> woolie would not have liked Hanharr.
[2:02:13] <sweetestbeefs> i will stand by this
[2:02:17] <Broken_Sonex> @waywardhavoc Kind of, yeah WutFace Kreygasm
[2:02:38] <Broken_Sonex> @sweetestbeefs THIS IS TRUTH
[2:02:40] <%SveriSageAdvice> oh shouldnt Disney be down Blizzard's throat about the Shadowlands? lol
[2:02:50] <%SveriSageAdvice> that would be hilarious if they got that trigger happy
[2:02:56] <%slimmixrp> Dont
[2:02:58] <%Ranryu692> when you go to the refugee sector
[2:03:01] <GustauveVIII> @PatStaresAt Atton only needs to be inthe refugee sector
[2:03:01] <scrublordsamurai> can it please be time for her to die soon i hate her
[2:03:07] <%bassoontyphoon> what a perfectly innocuous cleaning droid!
[2:03:08] <AdmiralButtloaf> before going to refugee area
[2:03:10] <sweetestbeefs> Honestly, now would be fine
[2:03:13] <Broken_Sonex> @sweetestbeefs Woolie doesn't know what he wants sometimes
[2:03:17] <GustauveVIII> @PatStaresAt so bring Atton to the central refugee area
[2:03:25] <TrollKing96> Holy shit I didn't know Wookies could be huge scumbags.
[2:03:25] <Too_Much_Nukie> Yeah I don't know if you need to have him in the party once to trigger it. It doesn't make sense if you don't, but a lot of things in this game don't make sense.
[2:03:48] <waywardhavoc> you will die there
[2:04:12] <sweetestbeefs> prepare that force heal, gamer
[2:04:19] <sweetestbeefs> or the poison mask
[2:04:33] <%dekkitout> That was very Karen of you
[2:04:34] <panlakes> vwo vwo vwo, I love twirling those sabers man
[2:05:13] <GustauveVIII> @PatStaresAt There are two Stealth Field Generator events in Nar Shadaa; one is in the docks, the other is in the cantina
[2:05:35] <sweetestbeefs> you threatened to kill him
[2:05:38] <$Invlux> I can't believe you killed that Jizzer
[2:05:59] <panlakes> Those music cues are fucking essential
[2:06:08] <sweetestbeefs> now he'll never be able to play his J'izz music ever again
[2:06:24] <+ratspice> is that peenchin?
[2:07:27] <%Huntercd> Kill that fat worm
[2:08:03] <panlakes> Do you think holding a lightsaber would give you that funny tickle sensation from the vibration
[2:08:56] <%ThirdWelles> I'm back! Sway bars installed! Time for a test drive!

[2:11:09] <%GalacticaPhanto> oh it has ass cheeks you can see ewww
[2:11:15] <%JumboCrunchies> Yeah this whole species is pretty.. not great.
[2:11:15] <%Mr_Pylon> Why wear a hat but no pants, whyyy
[2:11:26] <%bassoontyphoon> this is like one step below the shopkeepers in Indigo Prophecy and Omikron
[2:11:33] <%Dunmarkh> the genitals are that hat
[2:11:35] <%TIME_PUNCHER> @mr_pylon because he's a dickhead
[2:11:42] <sweetestbeefs> those wings wouldnt even be able to support his body
[2:11:51] <+SolidusRex> You must construct additional Pylons
[2:11:52] <Too_Much_Nukie> I enjoy watching the dawning realization on Pat's face.
[2:11:53] <scrublordsamurai> Starwars= Racism
[2:12:04] <kenny_biff> why bioware Kappa

[2:12:32] <sweetestbeefs> ARE YOU READY FOR THE BEST SIDEQUEST IN THE GAME???
[2:12:36] <GustauveVIII> @PatStaresAt for simplicity's sake, Silver/Alak/Toor

[2:19:49] <%asgard147> "Give me food Dad" psaDogchamp

[2:20:14] <sweetestbeefs> @waywardhavoc mandos arent afraid of cuddling the homies
[2:21:01] <%ssjklyco> How do they fit into their turtlenecks?
[2:21:08] <waywardhavoc> share warmth on nar shaddaa

[2:22:52] <%SirGO0SE> I will :)
[2:22:58] <megamirk> what a smart dead man
[2:22:59] <Too_Much_Nukie> He died so fast.
[2:23:04] <Too_Much_Nukie> LUL
[2:23:06] <+mr_killed_instantly> They're all back at it now.
[2:23:07] <waywardhavoc> no xenos
[2:23:07] <GustauveVIII> @PatStaresAt that ithorian was "technically" a quest
[2:23:12] <sweetestbeefs> you killed him in like
[2:23:14] <%Alazull> I mean he didn't even trouble you to begin with?
[2:23:15] <sweetestbeefs> half a second
[2:23:22] <$Mekhet09> Why is it always so cartoonishly evil/
[2:23:35] <megamirk> Imma gonna lootra you
[2:23:46] <waywardhavoc> called you fat
[2:23:50] <TourettesPlays> @GustauveVIII Dark Side = Stupid psycho that sabotages all their own oppurtunities
[2:23:51] <GustauveVIII> @PatStaresAt that human was also "technically" a quest
[2:23:57] <%brickwall35> SHE'S FAT 🚨🚨🚨
[2:23:58] <+mr_killed_instantly> The orgy starts in 3 minutes!
[2:24:02] <Too_Much_Nukie> Lootra gave you a double-bladed lightsaber.
[2:24:03] <waywardhavoc> one last own before getting decapitated
[2:24:07] <Cruel_Tentacles> Dark side seems tight.
[2:24:18] <sweetestbeefs> he did a fuckin roudhouse kick before he died LUL
[2:24:19] <%Alazull> Visas just splooshing over all this petty murdder
[2:24:23] <takokasa> secret tunnel~
[2:24:25] <TourettesPlays> Mysterious door that gives Karen a headache for some reason
[2:25:05] <JayEarly> Was that a Watto?
[2:25:25] <sweetestbeefs> Thats cuz youre basically in end game
[2:25:31] <%SirGO0SE> the little iron giant :)
[2:25:34] <Broken_Sonex> IT'S A tRaP
[2:25:37] <%MidnightBurst12> a lot of people in a city
[2:25:54] <sweetestbeefs> nar shadda is basically the tutorial world after the game opens up
[2:26:15] <Too_Much_Nukie> @PatStaresAt Attack is your chance to hit not your damage.
[2:26:19] <$Mekhet09> I've been thinking about old games trapped on the PS3. When are they going to port Infamous and puppeteer.
[2:26:22] <JayEarly> KOTOR jedi are literally D&D wizards but they use MP instead of spells per day and their MP rechargers
[2:26:24] <Too_Much_Nukie> DnD rules
[2:26:27] <+mr_killed_instantly> Syringe fingers +5
[2:26:37] <JayEarly> so most grossly overpowered class ever ever ever
[2:26:42] <Animal_Farm4> I always found it interesting how Nar Shada you could go good long enough to get Mira then go dark side and she had story for it
[2:26:58] <subjectg> dnd wizards if you had to save vs 30+ dc spells all the time
[2:27:14] <Too_Much_Nukie> That's completed, not failed.
[2:27:21] <megamirk> how nice of that Bith to leave his arm behind for you
[2:27:45] <Too_Much_Nukie> Mind your own god damn business. Don't go snooping into mysterious signals.
[2:27:59] <JayEarly> baby snore
[2:28:07] <JayEarly> baby snore loud
[2:28:12] <%Daxalog> But what if I like Populated docks?
[2:28:15] <sweetestbeefs> those signals definitely WONT come back later, trust me
[2:28:16] <megamirk> oh no
[2:28:16] <%MidnightBurst12> docks: cleansed
[2:28:20] <%SirGO0SE> ign gave super mario 3d world a 7 LUL
[2:28:28] <%Arancet> "i declare this world clean"

[2:28:49] <megamirk> who cares about ign
[2:28:49] <%Daxalog> Dont you need Carth for this part?
[2:28:53] <%Daxalog> Atton*
[2:28:54] <sweetestbeefs> they gave god hand a 3, of course they are
[2:28:57] <%Ipsenscastle> I've not read IGN in almost 10 years now
[2:29:09] <+BigDumBeak> does IGN get any ratings right?
[2:29:17] <JayEarly> This is the horniest Star Wars game
[2:29:17] <%SveriSageAdvice> did they hire the same dude who only played FPS game but was forced to play Football Manager?
[2:29:17] <%Dunmarkh> that's worse than the guy game
[2:29:19] <Sapphire_Breeze> they also gave Anthem 6.5 so it's only slightly worse than 3D World
[2:29:20] <%Huntercd> NTR him
[2:29:21] <%asgard147> Better be something VERY wrong with that game or they're fuckin' stupid
[2:29:25] <%bhp_99> they gave the medium an 8/10
[2:29:27] <+mr_killed_instantly> SM3DW is the God Hand of video games
[2:29:28] <%Daxalog> Efflux: Noun: the flowing out of a particular substance or particle.
[2:29:31] <%rumtumtugnutz> They gave the medium a ten, so prolly
[2:29:42] <Too_Much_Nukie> @PatStaresAt He literally just told her he could smell her cunt.
[2:29:43] <Sapphire_Breeze> what a simp
[2:29:45] <sweetestbeefs> I dont like the concept of the gross hair tendrils "twitching"

[2:31:07] <%RedSqurrl> she just fucking diiiiiiipped lmao
[2:31:15] <subjectg> now think about that dude on onderon that wanted you to touch his lekku
[2:31:50] <Too_Much_Nukie> Lekku are highly erogenous zones for Twi'lek so touching one is like touching their dicks.
[2:31:58] <+ReallyBigRocks> damn he shiny
[2:32:03] <Too_Much_Nukie> With all that implies.
[2:32:19] <+ReallyBigRocks> Got that WAL

[2:32:41] <%Alazull> Dude fuck this guy

[2:33:13] <sweetestbeefs> "bring me a willing female"

[2:34:27] <waywardhavoc> kratos babe
[2:34:27] <%Agami23> its bullshit that they think no one would want goth dommy mommy kay-ren to dance for them.
[2:34:29] <sweetestbeefs> obsidian was HORNY

[2:35:13] <JunkyardCrow> Do the Shepard SourPls
[2:35:14] <ThDark> I always loved how awful the dances were in these games
[2:35:16] <subjectg> the precursor to the shepard shuffle
[2:35:22] <%Huntercd> Can you keep the outfit?
[2:35:23] <Broken_Sonex> This is canon BTW since exile is female
[2:35:23] <sweetestbeefs> your dancing was so bad it put him to sleep
[2:35:33] <scrublordsamurai> YAY SEXY DANCE TIME!
[2:35:34] <+mr_killed_instantly> Le petite mort
[2:35:44] <%Ipsenscastle> this is worse than the Mass Effect dance because it's supposed to be sexy
[2:36:00] <%AdamElJefe> What happens with this quest if you're a dude?
[2:36:05] <Broken_Sonex> Now keep that on for the whole game
[2:36:11] <sweetestbeefs> @AdamElJefe handmaiden
[2:36:12] <GustauveVIII> you get handmaiden to do it if you're male
[2:36:17] <+mr_killed_instantly> Force coom
[2:36:28] <%AdamElJefe> Ohhhh I see
[2:36:31] <Too_Much_Nukie> @PatStaresAt Open the lightsaber crate again?
[2:36:32] <Animal_Farm4> That's a pretty shit vault LUL
[2:36:33] <huskarl_zap> Force kek
[2:36:34] <sweetestbeefs> how did he get a lightsaber
[2:36:35] <subjectg> “Eh, they’re breaking into master’s stash, he don’t pay me enough to give a shit.”
[2:36:37] <%RedSqurrl> Worth lmao
[2:36:40] <devanmuse> one Lightsaber AND the outfit
[2:36:40] <%slimmixrp> Great if its your first planet though
[2:36:41] <Too_Much_Nukie> It's bugged sometimes where it can be opened twice.
[2:36:42] <%crimsonharvest> time to cast Force Stop Wasting My Time
[2:36:43] <%Dunmarkh> Hey, you get to keep the outfit
[2:36:43] <%thedankestmeeme> KHAWANA BOTAA
[2:36:57] <megamirk> mooka shaka paka
[2:37:01] <Broken_Sonex> @PatStaresAt I heard you can randomise what you get you keep reloading
[2:37:08] <%thedankestmeeme> Why do they say that everytime?
[2:37:18] <huskarl_zap> Only way to save nar shaada is extermitnatus
[2:37:19] <subjectg> jedawananinibobo
[2:37:20] <%thedankestmeeme> KHAWANA BOTAA
[2:37:21] <Broken_Sonex> THAT'S JUST WHAT I HEARD THO
[2:37:22] <%slimmixrp> Its always a lightsaber
[2:37:23] <+mr_killed_instantly> the friends we made coom along the way are the real reward
[2:37:28] <JayEarly> it's so weird they put random loot in this game
[2:37:35] <%slimmixrp> Just different type of lightsaber
[2:37:36] <sweetestbeefs> @PatStaresAt you did a strip for a greasy slug man! hooray!
[2:37:50] <Too_Much_Nukie> I can't imagine why either.
[2:37:52] <%whyskeywolfe> Was the random loot something they added in?
[2:37:56] <+chaumiester> Because you overfeed him?
[2:37:56] <TourettesPlays> How is random loot weird for an RPG
[2:37:57] <huskarl_zap> xuz you over feed him
[2:38:07] <+Verd_254> splayed out like an idiot
[2:38:09] <%MidnightBurst12> because food
[2:38:11] <%crimsonharvest> Why wouldn't it, its still based on d&d and avoiding hand placing loot is a big part of the point of the engine
[2:38:15] <+chaumiester> Yeah, that's how I sleep
[2:38:15] <Midknightsun316> My french bulldog slept like that
[2:38:20] <+chaumiester> Why is that weird?
[2:38:20] <sweetestbeefs> he's freeballing, leave him alone
[2:38:26] <+mr_killed_instantly> What a chad
[2:38:36] <+Verd_254> that's how they do, bulldogs are hilarious
[2:38:43] <+mr_killed_instantly> doing the double leg spread
[2:38:44] <subjectg> iirc, loot is determined when you first load into a zone, so if you entered the docks earlier the loot would’ve been determined then. Might have changed, but idk @patstaresat
[2:38:44] <+ReallyBigRocks> Lizard men racist against people with ears
[2:38:45] <Broken_Sonex> My dog does that, except he's always on his back showing everything off.
[2:38:48] <huskarl_zap> trandoshans like >ears
[2:38:50] <%wibbwobbler> that's great
[2:38:55] <Midknightsun316> Yeah, they are sweet babies
[2:38:56] <+mr_killed_instantly> for maximum impact
[2:39:00] <JayEarly> @crimsonharvest oh yeah this is the Neverwinter Nights engine isn't it
[2:39:07] <%Ranryu692> Trandoshans? More like Trashdoshans
[2:39:12] <huskarl_zap> imagen not having superior holes
[2:39:12] <%crimsonharvest> yep Jay this is Aurora
[2:39:12] <+chaumiester> Wait... Pat. Are you saying that you don't sleep with your penis pointed towards the core of the Earth? You weirdo
[2:39:38] <%thedankestmeeme> Jesus thank god theres no mic connected to this game cause youd be BUSTED
[2:39:50] <%Arancet> why is there a hole in your matress
[2:40:07] <Too_Much_Nukie> @PatStaresAt If you put Atton in your party he'll skip one of the Pazaak matches here for you.
[2:40:16] <Too_Much_Nukie> You can skip all of them.
[2:40:19] <Meekest> He knows that you'll do it for evil
[2:40:25] <subjectg> You can cheat all the matches
[2:40:28] <sweetestbeefs> pazzak time
[2:41:03] <Broken_Sonex> Cheat and forget about this stupid mini game Woolie loves for some reason.
[2:41:25] <sweetestbeefs> its just triple triad
[2:41:36] <JayEarly> I'd enjoy pazaak if the ai didn't cheat its fucking ass off
[2:41:39] <%whyskeywolfe> Why does this robot have such a fuckable voice
[2:41:42] <%SirGO0SE> oh no the droids voice is HOT
[2:41:44] <Animal_Farm4> It's nothing like triple triad

[2:42:21] <%SaiyanShoto> Oh yeah keep talking Kreygasm Kreygasm
[2:42:25] <JayEarly> Why doesn't every robot have a sexy voice is what I'm wondering
[2:42:30] <%SirGO0SE> this is for sure a phone sex robot
[2:42:40] <scrublordsamurai> woolie must be really overdue for a memory wipe

[2:46:51] <+mr_killed_instantly> Endless ffffffffilth
[2:46:53] <Aydarkzero> you should though
[2:46:54] <Too_Much_Nukie> You can force persuade to win the duel.
[2:47:02] <sweetestbeefs> just talk to him
[2:47:02] <subjectg> you can’t beat his quasar OTK deck
[2:47:11] <Too_Much_Nukie> It's the best.
[2:47:16] <JayEarly> this is before they invented renegade interrupts pat
[2:47:20] <Too_Much_Nukie> Ultimate YuGiOh strat
[2:47:24] <Aydarkzero> @subjectg you, you're okay
[2:47:27] <JayEarly> they didn't have the technology
[2:47:33] <sweetestbeefs> jedi mind tricks win again!
[2:47:39] <%AncelDeLambert> I love how you can ask him later to distract someone
[2:47:48] <Broken_Sonex> I wish I could force Woolie to watch me cheat at card games.
[2:48:00] <Aydarkzero> i can't believe you just won
[2:48:09] <Aydarkzero> why does he suck?
[2:48:09] <sweetestbeefs> fuck pazzak
[2:48:13] <+mr_killed_instantly> more smüt
[2:48:14] <@commanderclaw> (Woolie will remember that)
[2:48:15] <GarbageQueenEllie> Blasphemer!
[2:48:15] <%AzureGale> BLASPHEMY
[2:48:15] <GustauveVIII> pazaak is fun... for the first 5 times you play it
[2:48:17] <%AncelDeLambert> Pazaak DOES suck
[2:48:18] <megamirk> space blackjack ain't shit
[2:48:26] <%AdamElJefe> that's a tweet LUL
[2:48:28] <TourettesPlays> hey pat how many games of caravan have you won
[2:48:33] <%AncelDeLambert> space Pokemon blackjack
[2:48:42] <Broken_Sonex> @commanderclaw (And no one will care)
[2:48:46] <Giztech> definitely no 52 pick up
[2:48:48] <@commanderclaw> Caravan's super easy though
[2:48:49] <%AncelDeLambert> I have never even PLAYED caravan
[2:48:51] <%Agami23> because gwent isnt ass
[2:48:53] <%Ranryu692> Gwent was eh
[2:48:58] <Animal_Farm4> The problem with space blackjack is that there are actually just better cards that you don't have
[2:49:01] <%Alazull> Gwents actually interesting though
[2:49:01] <pally_din> Ok Caravan genuinely sucks
[2:49:02] <sweetestbeefs> Gwent is fucking great tho
[2:49:02] <%wibbwobbler> woof nice
[2:49:03] <JayEarly> I've won dozen games of Caravan and I don't understand why I win or lose half the time
[2:49:06] <Aydarkzero> Caravan is a game you can play?
[2:49:07] <subjectg> real men play hearts
[2:49:08] <qu3kl41n_the_impure_king> yeeap, but how many triple triad cards do you have?
[2:49:08] <%Alazull> Compared to blackjack in space
[2:49:28] <+mr_killed_instantly> Gwent was great until they made it an actual game
[2:49:29] <megamirk> you know what KOTOR needs?
[2:49:30] <megamirk> mahjong
[2:49:36] <spongeofmystery> Gwent is legit a game within a game
[2:49:41] <Animal_Farm4> The 2nd person you have to fight in that tournament kept top decking perfect cards against me FeelsBadMan

[2:50:40] <subjectg> we love you too sweetie
[2:50:40] <Broken_Sonex> I'm clipping that
[2:50:44] <sweetestbeefs> JUST LIKE I TAUGHT YOU
[2:50:55] <Broken_Sonex> For a future fan animation
[2:50:59] <adzy2k6> Fable has pretty good evil mechanics
[2:51:10] <JayEarly> it's less efficient than lightning but i find it extremely fun to force choke dudes
[2:51:13] <+mr_killed_instantly> Bastard Simulater
[2:51:13] <Too_Much_Nukie> Fable has that issue where you can be extremely evil in the towns but the story still forces you to be good.
[2:51:15] <Animal_Farm4> Being able to twirl my moustache is fun as hell
[2:51:17] <AShinyVagikarp> It works sooooo
[2:51:26] <Ell1ot> tie the lady to the railroad tracks and twirl your mustache
[2:51:27] <Aydarkzero> it's funny
[2:51:32] <%MidnightBurst12> swing it right into their skulls
[2:51:32] <TourettesPlays> Twice in New Vegas you can find a little girls lost teddy bear, and rip its head off in front of her. TWICE
[2:51:34] <adzy2k6> @Too_Much_Nukie I mean, the ending lets you be pretty evil
[2:51:36] <%Ranryu692> it's a lot more fun than being realistically evil
[2:51:36] <pally_din> Yeah even if you don't do it, it's nice to have to OPTION to be laughably evil
[2:51:40] <megamirk> yeah but they usually don't let you be evil enough
[2:51:41] <GarbageQueenEllie> I've grown to love it
[2:51:44] <Animal_Farm4> Yes. You're always a paragon of virtue Pat Kappa
[2:51:45] <+mr_killed_instantly> Game Dev Story
[2:51:50] <%asgard147> Sometimes, you just wanna be the cartioonishly evil bastard limesEvil
[2:51:50] <Broken_Sonex> I love Fable so much. The third game can fuck off tho.
[2:51:52] <sweetestbeefs> thats cuz for every cartoonishly evil act in this game, there's a moment like the jedi conclave
[2:51:55] <wembleyttv> I always go evil 1st time
[2:51:57] <Aydarkzero> First Playthrough Good, but second playthrough Evil hard mode
[2:52:14] <uncledoodsauce> you're not really evil in mass effect, you're just being an asshole
[2:52:17] <TourettesPlays> What about the biggest, stupidest evil choice you can make at the very end of this game?
[2:52:22] <%UvBenServed> """"""Dangerous"""""""""
[2:52:34] <adzy2k6> I didn't like how Bioshock Infinite removed rather than added to the ability to be evil in that series
[2:52:37] <GustauveVIII> THROUGH THE WALL
[2:52:37] <sweetestbeefs> GENOCIIIIDE
[2:52:50] <JayEarly> Mass Effect Renegade bounces between "get the job done at any cost" and "what the fuck Shepard"

[2:53:36] <subjectg> The Quintessential Quintuplets (2020)

[2:53:42] <GustauveVIII> yay pat helped the refugees
[2:53:44] <%psidefx> and then they died
[2:53:49] <devanmuse> you're going full murder hobo
[2:53:51] <Ell1ot> when you get to the top floor and you ask the boss where the boss is
[2:53:52] <%UvBenServed> Anyway, so then I started zappin
[2:54:00] <sweetestbeefs> so this is why palpatine is so godamn strong
[2:54:04] <%psidefx> They were K-Pop stans they had to go
[2:54:13] <%espanishcanamurciana> Hey Pat! How goes it on exotic N A R S H A D A ?
[2:54:15] <sweetestbeefs> he can just obliterate people with lightning
[2:54:30] <megamirk> gonna pay you a hundred lightnings to fuck off
[2:54:55] <GustauveVIII> @PatStaresAt the speeder acts as a quick travel device only on nar shadaa; it becomes permanently inaccessible if you complete nar shadaa without fixing it
[2:55:10] <GustauveVIII> IT DOES
[2:55:13] <sweetestbeefs> it does
[2:55:19] <Too_Much_Nukie> It becomes permanently inaccessible either way.
[2:55:24] <sweetestbeefs> its only good for influence @PatStaresAt
[2:55:37] <+jah24701> dammit i haven't caught up on youtube yet
[2:55:45] <Too_Much_Nukie> Yeah you can use it to boost Atton and Bao-Dur's influence.
[2:56:01] <Too_Much_Nukie> You killed the Serroco boss. You have to talk to the refugees before killing the exchange.
[2:56:02] <sweetestbeefs> HK influence too
[2:56:25] <GustauveVIII> @PatStaresAt Exchange becomes hostile if you keep looting containers
[2:56:31] <sweetestbeefs> yeah the spawn is weird

[3:27:20] <sweetestbeefs> What T-pose? Kappa
[3:27:35] <Broken_Sonex> I've had three bullterriers. Never saw a reason to do it.
[3:27:36] <kenny_biff> my step dad refused to neuter our dog now hes too old for the procedure. doh
[3:27:53] <Ell1ot> is doggie done with the pee pads?
[3:27:54] <@SoFarFetched> its also in case your dog runs away or somehow gets loose and you dont know whether or not he humped a stray dog or what.
[3:28:00] <Brickston> @Broken_Sonex I've had as many bull terriers and my god I can't imagine how hard it would've been to control intact ones
[3:28:01] <%psidefx> gotta go to the ship
[3:28:02] <Broken_Sonex> They were all sweethearst
[3:28:02] <@SoFarFetched> and suddenly puppies

[3:28:09] <Too_Much_Nukie> It's fine.
[3:28:19] <%walternatorz> I swear there was an NPC near the exit to the next area that looked just like pat

[3:28:20] <+jrockmaster392> yea i can chat
[3:28:24] <Too_Much_Nukie> I think people are forgetting you get a point to talk to Atton before the Jek Jek Tarr.

[3:28:55] <%walternatorz> attack of the clones?
[3:28:57] <%Undenizen> do you do that every time you see someone you don't recognise?
[3:29:05] <Giztech> T-posing.... they're asserting dominance. STRIKE THEM DOWN
[3:29:13] <+jrockmaster392> just want to say as a new follower that you have a very cute dog
[3:29:17] <blue8moon> I find the laser swords clipping through party members to be weirdly funny
[3:29:23] <+chaumiester> You gonna play it again? Evil Within 2 I mean
[3:29:26] <%damienlunas> damienlunas subscribed at Tier 1. They've subscribed for 17 months, currently on a 15 month streak! Hey Pat! I noticed you tend to tell Zangief to sit, shake, and speak in that order. To make him a smartie boy, you should try and keep mixing up that order so he learn good. PS I might be studying at Kobe University in Japan this year!
[3:29:29] <+mikesapartment> oh akumu is dumb af
[3:29:32] <@SoFarFetched> do keyboard and mouse geefPlz
[3:29:38] <Broken_Sonex> @Broken_Sonex The first one was hard, but after you understand what they're about it's easy to deal with. My current one, the third bullterrier, is only a year old and he's already calmed down
[3:29:40] <sweetestbeefs> @Too_Much_Nukie I don't think you can turn him into a jedi there, though. Story stuff locks you out of that dialogue option, I think
[3:29:42] <%whyskeywolfe> It's hard to go back to after Resi2Make.
[3:29:48] <+chaumiester> Terrible as in Hard. Or Terrible as in un-playable?
[3:30:10] <%Agami23> yup, and yet my brother refused to play normal
[3:30:17] <+chaumiester> Isn't that the same deal with Evil Within 1? With Akuma mode
[3:30:36] <sweetestbeefs> Oh, so It's just unfair. Neat
[3:30:48] <Broken_Sonex> @Broken_Sonex Snipping them never crossed my mind since i always found it cruel.
[3:30:56] <mrblack499> so it's shit

[3:41:54] <sweetestbeefs> oh man, its the gieco gecko!
[3:42:04] <Too_Much_Nukie> Trandoshans are cool.
[3:42:06] <sweetestbeefs> NOOOO YOU KILLED GIECO
[3:42:10] <Too_Much_Nukie> Their culture is toxic.
[3:42:12] <kenny_biff> this part isnt hard
[3:42:12] <Sunstalker> It's GEX the gecko PogChamp
[3:42:14] <+cafefunk> this game seems pretty long tbh
[3:42:26] <%UnabashedGarbage> Look at those jobber lizards
[3:42:31] <Brickston> this is like a luau at mel blanc's house!
[3:42:44] <kenny_biff> this whole game is kinda easy after a point
[3:42:47] <%espanishcanamurciana> those trandoshans are just doing their job pat
[3:42:48] <sweetestbeefs> I wish trandoshans were in star wars more
[3:42:53] <sweetestbeefs> theyre so cool
[3:43:11] <Too_Much_Nukie> The makeup is really hard.

[3:43:21] <+ReallyBigRocks> The legendary Trandoshan botch job
[3:43:25] <+cafefunk> hey Pat are you still playing genshin impact
[3:43:28] <sweetestbeefs> fair.
[3:43:28] <Too_Much_Nukie> So they're more common in animated stuff.
[3:43:28] <+spookler> Woolie raid, kind of..
[3:43:30] <%Maids4lyfe> disney can't have more slavers would draw too much attention to the mouse
[3:43:46] <Too_Much_Nukie> Pat it's like YOU'RE the storm that is approaching.
[3:44:05] <Broken_Sonex> If you want more ex don't go near the bridge
[3:44:10] <sweetestbeefs> pat is quite literally THE STORM
[3:44:16] <%espanishcanamurciana> in Control you basically are the center of a moving storm
[3:44:21] <GarbageQueenEllie> @Too_Much_Nukie Provoooking, black clouds in iiiisolatiooooon
[3:44:43] <Pookiedaexzile> I think Pat would be one of those dudes really into SAO if he was like 7 years younger, something about how he over levels
[3:45:07] <sweetestbeefs> Slavery Time!
[3:45:11] <sweetestbeefs> Again
[3:45:46] <Too_Much_Nukie> You've sold like 3 people into slavery today alone.

[3:48:57] <sweetestbeefs> the voice mixing was different
[3:49:10] <+cafefunk> "sure as hell" so does that mean theres space religion?
[3:49:11] <Broken_Sonex> Man, Atton is the best Han Solo ever
[3:49:27] <Pookiedaexzile> Damn bro you tryin to fuck
[3:49:36] <Too_Much_Nukie> YES THEY DESERVED TO DIE AND I HOPE THEY BURN IN HELL

[3:49:44] <sweetestbeefs> PREACH BROTHER
[3:49:45] <mrblack499> true lol
[3:49:49] <+tizz86> tizz86 gifted a Tier 1 sub to Pookiedaexzile! They have given 417 Gift Subs in the channel!

[3:50:00] <%bhp_99> YEAH
[3:50:01] <%espanishcanamurciana> Ashen sees through the lies of the jedi!
[3:50:01] <Too_Much_Nukie> @heartlesshealer genocide is generally considered a bad-to-do.
[3:50:05] <%dekkitout> There it is
[3:50:06] <sweetestbeefs> YEAH KILL EM ALL
[3:50:10] <%bhp_99> FUCK THE JEDI

[3:50:20] <sweetestbeefs> FUCK THE CODE
[3:50:25] <mrblack499> true loll
[3:50:27] <Broken_Sonex> SPITTIN' MAD FACTS
[3:50:30] <wembleyttv> Good job with the brainwashing pat
[3:50:34] <+cafefunk> oh this man us antinatalist to the core
[3:50:35] <%Undenizen> 610 BILLION DEAD JEDI. KILL EM ALL 1987
[3:50:39] <heartlesshealer> @Too_Much_Nukie Yeah, just seems weird to not put that in for dark side MC
[3:50:41] <+cafefunk> *is
[3:50:47] <%Pookiedaexzile> Kayrn Just went splorch
[3:50:49] <Brickston> atton is tipping his fedora
[3:51:00] <%SirGO0SE> red pilled af
[3:51:08] <shamefulbowsettefolder> Yes the hate is strong in this one
[3:51:11] <sweetestbeefs> atton is BASED
[3:51:22] <sweetestbeefs> He's a SIGMA MALE
[3:51:38] <%espanishcanamurciana> Based psaWink based on what psaWink
[3:51:39] <heartlesshealer> he's infected with the sigma virus
[3:51:40] <%Undenizen> he's not even listening to you.
[3:51:43] <Too_Much_Nukie> Atton, have you ever heard the tale of Darth Plagueis the Wise?
[3:51:55] <Too_Much_Nukie> I thought not. It's not a story the jedi would tell you.
[3:52:07] <wembleyttv> Do, it
[3:52:07] <rosemon5001> DROID RAIN HELL YEA mando fist pump
[3:52:12] <+Dova573> Jesus what happened to Attons face?
[3:52:12] <%Pookiedaexzile> Derk seid
[3:52:12] <Brickston> At this moment, Atton is euphoric. Not because of the grace of some phony jedi, but because he is enlightened by his HATE
[3:52:25] <%espanishcanamurciana> Pat I can't blv you sold T3
[3:52:31] <%ssjklyco> For a series that is more or less a family-ish series. Star Wars has a ton of murder
[3:53:02] <Too_Much_Nukie> Yeah and they had to call children "younglings" in Revenge of the Sith so they didn't have to use the phrase "murdered children"
[3:53:03] <sweetestbeefs> @ssjklyco Murder: Fun for the whole Family!
[3:53:07] <%Agami23> hell yeah!
[3:53:07] <%bhp_99> I love this part, how it's not hard to kill jedi
[3:53:11] <%Undenizen> Yeah, Atton is the TRUE moral high ground!
[3:53:13] <%Pookiedaexzile> Splorch
[3:53:19] <+cafefunk> this game gets DARK
[3:53:19] <%Mr_Pylon> Oh he nuttin
[3:53:19] <%Deano8817> I just got here what the FUCK happened to atton
[3:53:21] <Too_Much_Nukie> Even though they Anakin talks about killing children in Clone Wars.
[3:53:23] <+BigDumBeak> @ssjklyco AND slavery!
[3:53:23] <GarbageQueenEllie> "I made them watch Nukie on full volume"
[3:53:28] <Too_Much_Nukie> And Attack of the Clones.
[3:53:47] <%Alazull> @PatStaresAt Killing Jedi gets Atton hard, but turning them is what really gets his vinegar strokes
[3:53:50] <Pookiedaexzile> Kayrn: You can throw up walls...but can you break down mine
[3:53:53] <%GarbageNirvana> Walls of Pazaak
[3:53:56] <sweetestbeefs> "not just the men, but the women and children too"
[3:54:29] <%psidefx> *ahem* break the walls DOWN
[3:54:47] <sweetestbeefs> He tortured the jedi by making them play pazzak
[3:55:02] <Broken_Sonex> I love when he goes on about how it's easy to kill Jedi if you kill their Padwns right in front of them and fuck em up.
[3:55:16] <blue8moon> You're both so gross
[3:55:35] <%Ranryu692> who among your party has died? people traveling with you seem to do pretty well so fad
[3:55:39] <sweetestbeefs> what a crusty-ass couple of psychos
[3:55:39] <%Ranryu692> far
[3:55:53] <sweetestbeefs> @Ranryu692 he sold T3 into slavery.
[3:55:53] <jorniev> WHATS WRONG WITH YOUR FACE
[3:55:56] <%psidefx> The crusty crew
[3:56:03] <Too_Much_Nukie> @Ranryu692 The only surviving soldier under your command from the Mandalorian Wars is Bao-Dur.
[3:56:08] <Too_Much_Nukie> And that's because he pressed the button.
[3:56:13] <GarbageQueenEllie> Is he taking about The Star Forge system, or Malachor?
[3:56:15] <wembleyttv> But you just said YOU BEEN DOING THAT
[3:56:24] <Broken_Sonex> Atton's got some weird toad eyes
[3:56:24] <%Ranryu692> @sweetestbeefs he's still *alive* though
[3:56:37] <%AzureGale> um
[3:56:40] <%AzureGale> ummm
[3:56:43] <%AzureGale> UMMMMMM
[3:56:44] <JimJaspers> Good Atton... Gooooood.
[3:56:48] <scrumbotime> God he looks dirty and stinky
[3:56:48] <jorniev> YOUR DICK GOT HARD?
[3:56:52] <bigben01> Dude what
[3:56:56] <%Undenizen> drink
[3:56:56] <KaitlynnHere> Uh oh, now you’re Karen’s instrument now
[3:56:57] <sweetestbeefs> he got horny
[3:57:01] <$SGrim> Force Erection
[3:57:05] <%BinaryFireball> dick poked him in the eye
[3:57:09] <%Monkeyweed21> Force Prostate Massage
[3:57:16] <+cafefunk> god damn
[3:57:18] <jorniev> yup
[3:57:19] <%SirGO0SE> BOP to horny jail with Atton
[3:57:20] <%Ipsenscastle> what a weirdo
[3:57:23] <sweetestbeefs> "Your feelings fpr her are not real"
[3:57:26] <%AncelDeLambert> wow Atton that's super fucked up
[3:57:27] <%Mr_Pylon> this is some big serial killer shit
[3:57:32] <%Ipsenscastle> ugh
[3:57:38] <%AzureGale> Is Atton a yandere
[3:57:41] <+cafefunk> this man is a major sadist
[3:57:42] <Zeif00> me
[3:57:50] <jorniev> ATTON IS NO BARTH he is great
[3:57:50] <GarbageQueenEllie> (Killing Me Softly Intensifies)
[3:57:51] <@commanderclaw> He's not talking about romantic love chat, he's talking about platonic selfless love
[3:57:54] <Broken_Sonex> Man, Atton's like a lot of my friends if they had one bad day
[3:57:59] <JimJaspers> You don't games like this anymore chat.
[3:58:02] <BlacSoul> Coward
[3:58:03] <%Ipsenscastle> what a complete creepazoid
[3:58:29] <sweetestbeefs> TO BE FAIR
[3:58:33] <%espanishcanamurciana> speederZoom.sound
[3:58:39] <GarbageQueenEllie> @commanderclaw That redemptive love, empathy an' shit
[3:58:48] <Broken_Sonex> @jorniev Atton is his own man. Not a Carth. Not an Alister.
[3:58:49] <sweetestbeefs> he said he didnt feel any "romantic love" towards that lady
[3:58:55] <%Pookiedaexzile> Something more powerful
[3:58:56] <KaitlynnHere> Heheheh... she sacrificed herself so you’d end up in Karen’s hands, how ironic
[3:59:10] <@commanderclaw> This is so fucked
[3:59:16] <sweetestbeefs> and she basically programmed him to go "oh god what have i done"
[3:59:18] <jorniev> @jorniev and definetly not a solo
[3:59:18] <$Mekhet09> LOL
[3:59:18] <%SirGO0SE> tags: mindbreak
[3:59:25] <+cafefunk> wait, so he was already killing Jedi, and he was afraid the Sith would use him to....kill Jedi?
[3:59:27] <wembleyttv> So she stole his heart then like in P5
[3:59:39] <%Pookiedaexzile> TURN HIM TO THE DERK SIED
[3:59:45] <Too_Much_Nukie> FROM MY POINT OF VIEW
[3:59:46] <jorniev> YOU KNOW FROM A CERTAIN POINT OF VIEW
[3:59:50] <Too_Much_Nukie> IT IS THE JEDI WHO ARE EVIL!!!!!!!!!!!
[3:59:55] <KaitlynnHere> Atton needs some chapstick
[3:59:55] <JimJaspers> Here it is!
[3:59:55] <%MelBrooksKA> This is so fucked uip

[4:00:17] <sweetestbeefs> ONE THING
[4:00:20] <sweetestbeefs> I DONT KNOW WHy
[4:00:21] <wembleyttv> Is hell a concept in star wars?
[4:00:23] <KaitlynnHere> We can bring her back and kill her again, it’ll be big pog
[4:00:24] <bigben01> I heard it. I FELT IT!
[4:00:24] <%espanishcanamurciana> get out of my head Johnny Silverhand
[4:00:25] <SaltyAzteca> PATLOOKSLIKEASNAKE!
[4:00:30] <+jt427> time for jedicide
[4:00:30] <JimJaspers> DUN DUN DUN.
[4:00:30] <Too_Much_Nukie> Good job you get Exile Coins. Bad job you don't get your daily login bonus.
[4:00:33] <%Pookiedaexzile> YEYEYEYE
[4:00:35] <sweetestbeefs> IT DOESNT EVEN MATTER HOW HARD YOU TRY
[4:00:36] <%TIME_PUNCHER> "Yo, Atton you heard of this dope shit called genocide?"
[4:00:39] <%Undenizen> SURE!
[4:00:44] <GarbageQueenEllie> DAAAAMN
[4:00:45] <+cafefunk> wait but aren't we a Sith?
[4:00:52] <scrumbotime> He... didn't close his eyes
[4:00:53] <%psidefx> NOICE
[4:00:58] <%dekkitout> Drink
[4:00:58] <+nazzynoeyes> You have allowed this Darth Karen to twist your mind until now, you have become the very thing you swore to destroy.
[4:00:59] <wembleyttv> THE RAGE
[4:01:01] <KaitlynnHere> Yea mission- oh nvm she’s already dead
[4:01:03] <%Undenizen> IMAGINE URBAN PEOPLE ENJOYING A BARBECUE
[4:01:04] <%Pookiedaexzile> Now touch his butt
[4:01:10] <SaltyAzteca> Yes YEEEEEES
[4:01:21] <ElPlasa> YEEEYEYEYEYEYEYEYEYE
[4:01:21] <Broken_Sonex> When levelling up Atton, remember to get that skill that allows him to use his DEX instead of Strength so he's not dog shit with a lightsabre. @PatStaresAt
[4:01:25] <JimJaspers> The music. LUL
[4:01:26] <sweetestbeefs> now KISS
[4:01:27] <Too_Much_Nukie> Arise, my new apprentice
[4:01:29] <%YakumoYomi> Take the land that must be taken!
[4:01:50] <GustauveVIII> @PatStaresAt should try to avoid leveling Atton for his later solo event on Nar Shadaa. The HP restoration will be vital.
[4:01:50] <+cafefunk> wait I dont understand- he wants to kill both jedi and sith, but Karen IS a Sith
[4:01:50] <%Pookiedaexzile> Zangief can feel the darkness
[4:02:00] <%Monkeyweed21> you missed the Atton dialogue where he talks about how to kill Jedi
[4:02:09] <%Pookiedaexzile> He is now of the Sith
[4:02:15] <%Undenizen> So like... are there lust sith? that' make sense right?
[4:02:16] <KaitlynnHere> I feel like that orchestra just gets louder and louder the further dark you go
[4:02:28] <$Mekhet09> Not going to make him a gun sith?
[4:02:31] <GarbageQueenEllie> That is not a robe, Pat.
[4:02:37] <sweetestbeefs> a lot of the armor is this game is just... ugly
[4:02:40] <rosemon5001> every juan is exar kun
[4:02:53] <Sapphire_Breeze> punch lord Atton
[4:02:54] <+cafefunk> how does he want to kill Sith but work under a Sith?
[4:02:56] <Alazull> It's super lame that you can't wield lightsaber mainhand and blaster offhand
[4:03:00] <%Alazull> Be a Sith Corsair
[4:03:13] <+cafefunk> damn, you broke him BIG TIME, huh
[4:03:18] <Broken_Sonex> @sweetestbeefs Not even ugly. It's always just a vest.
[4:03:21] <sweetestbeefs> GOTH DOMMY MOMMY
[4:03:27] <%Pookiedaexzile> Yeah theres Lust sith, theres that red Twileak, Theres Count Doku for some people, theres VEntress, and Visa
[4:03:37] <Broken_Sonex> GOTH. PAWG.
[4:03:41] <%Pookiedaexzile> For some Kriea
[4:04:23] <%bassoontyphoon> Is this splatoon??
[4:04:30] <KaitlynnHere> @alazull probably because it’d take more fighting animations to do that and they only had one year to make this
[4:04:37] <%Alazull> @PatStaresAt Look at this knock-off Illithid motherfucker
[4:04:37] <rosemon5001> pog more spacists
[4:04:38] <GarbageQueenEllie> FUCK YOU, MICAL.
[4:04:46] <Broken_Sonex> Holy shit, i hate him
[4:04:49] <sweetestbeefs> FUCK YOU DISCIPLE
[4:04:58] <%Alazull> @KaitlynnHere I mean it should've been an option in KotoR 1
[4:05:01] <sweetestbeefs> HANDMAIDEN IS WAY BETTER
[4:05:16] <KaitlynnHere> Disciple still has that Jedi stick up his ass
[4:05:17] <%Pookiedaexzile> Discple is the worse Carth
[4:05:28] <%espanishcanamurciana> h a r a n a m o
[4:05:29] <Broken_Sonex> @sweetestbeefs It's not even funny how much better she it
[4:05:43] <Alazull> @KaitlynnHere Also fwiw it was 18 months
[4:05:49] <GarbageQueenEllie> At least Carth's hair looks better.
[4:06:13] <%bassoontyphoon> At least Carth's story lets you murder his kid in fornt of him for some Carth-arthis
[4:06:21] <%Pookiedaexzile> Kaiden is even better than Disciple
[4:06:21] <adzy2k6> I love how Goto is a reference to the goto statement in C
[4:06:31] <rosemon5001> man these fucks bring shame to cad bane
[4:06:31] <sweetestbeefs> @sweetestbeefs punch girl for life
[4:06:34] <GustauveVIII> @PatStaresAt dont need the breathing mask
[4:06:51] <rosemon5001> dumbest bug eyes aliens ever
[4:06:53] <%Alazull> @PatStaresAt This is one of the weakest parts of this games story
[4:06:53] <KaitlynnHere> This is the worst level
[4:06:56] <%Pookiedaexzile> HEll Jacob is better and he has like 2 scenes in Mass Effect 2
[4:07:08] <GarbageQueenEllie> Disciple looks like he gargles Mayonaise and Esbestos each morning
[4:07:11] <KaitlynnHere> It’s like the mining planet but with less people
[4:07:14] <%bassoontyphoon> I dont know man Jacob is pretty shit
[4:07:20] <sweetestbeefs> nar shadda is... not the greatest
[4:07:25] <sweetestbeefs> you'll see coming up
[4:07:28] <GustauveVIII> @PatStaresAt IS PAT READY FOR A SLOG? TSLRM MAKES IT A LOT MORE SLOGGY
[4:07:37] <+PenmanLupine> he looks like shit
[4:07:40] <sweetestbeefs> @bassoontyphoon he's better than kaidan
[4:07:41] <%Pookiedaexzile> Disciple is waaaay worse
[4:07:49] <Too_Much_Nukie> @PatStaresAt Fun fact: Nar Shadaa was completely remade during production. The original planet had an entirely different story.
[4:07:52] <Too_Much_Nukie> This shows.
[4:08:03] <%bassoontyphoon> @bassoontyphoon Kaidan is way better than Jacob
[4:08:06] <%RedSqurrl> b-b-b-baaaaaka
[4:08:33] <JaceDarkstar> anyone is better than jacob
[4:08:35] <$Mekhet09> Kaidan's problem is just that he's bland.
[4:08:44] <%SirGO0SE> i wonder if hanharr was a cute puppy
[4:09:03] <Broken_Sonex> Oh hey, it's that carpet Woolie likes for dumb reasons.
[4:09:06] <%bassoontyphoon> Kaidan is bland but Jacob is bland and a complete asshat
[4:09:06] <AdmiralButtloaf> why is it mispronounced if its not even in english
[4:09:10] <KaitlynnHere> @sirgo0se he was until he tasted human blood
[4:09:17] <%Pookiedaexzile> >Jacob> Kaiden> Power Gap< Disciple
[4:09:20] <GarbageQueenEllie> All Wookies are inspired by George Lucas' dog.
[4:09:23] <sweetestbeefs> "oh man i really hate that im a biotic, i cant replace my biotics cuz theyre experimental, ooooh shephard please feel bad for me, ooooooh"
[4:09:32] <$Mekhet09> Are they changing any of the story for ME trilogy like they are the camera angles?

[4:13:02] <%Undenizen> quick! take drugs!
[4:13:15] <GustauveVIII> @PatStaresAt So the preparation way is to level up whenever Atton is low HP. The exploitative way is to coward behind the bartender's counter and laugh at terrible AI pathing.
[4:13:34] <%KeiganOfAstora> If you don't know what Finesse is called then you probably don't have any LUL
[4:13:37] <Vyskus> I wonder if you can prep mines in this room before this event
[4:13:37] <Broken_Sonex> That's the one. Good
[4:13:39] <%Dakuu75> imagine if modern games let you tweak your skill tree MID FIGHT, lol

[4:22:47] <Broken_Sonex> @mrblack499 That IS a good ass, tbf
[4:22:54] <scrublordsamurai> @broken_sonex her plan is to die
[4:22:56] <GarbageQueenEllie> Mira has Pat's brother's impulse control.
[4:23:14] <sweetestbeefs> not as dumb as you LUL
[4:23:18] <%AncelDeLambert> at least when Leia went into Jabba's palace, she had a PLAN

[4:23:37] <%bassoontyphoon> "Youre dumber than I thought" says the woman who walked into an enemy base alone with no plan
[4:23:39] <sweetestbeefs> i mean, i guess she decided to wing it?
[4:23:42] <%Arweynn> @notsoy you do them as exile if you go to the bar BEFORE triggering the end sequence, otherwise your only option is to do them as mira here. as soon as you enter as exile and get the force power everyone is hostile
[4:24:12] <sweetestbeefs> WHAT WAS YOUR PLAANNNN
[4:24:14] <%Alazull> This could've been so much more interesting if they could have spent more time on it

[4:24:37] <GarbageQueenEllie> Mira kidnaps and starves people for money, and that makes her cool in my books
[4:24:41] <kenny_biff> its my least favorite planet
[4:24:44] <+chrispunchesboulder> Pat how would you rank the planets?

[4:25:46] <GarbageQueenEllie> This planet in particular would benefit a lot from a remake.
[4:25:49] <%bassoontyphoon> Is he going to go kill Carol Baskins???
[4:25:50] <scrublordsamurai> jedi master Cleatus
[4:25:58] <+ThomasOfTroy> He's happy you got a guy to kill himself and convinced a mom to sell herself into slavery?
[4:26:02] <rosemon5001> he smoked the space cush
[4:26:05] <%Dunmarkh> REAL JEDIS DO SLAVERY
[4:26:07] <$Mekhet09> They only assumed you'd be a good guy.

[4:26:26] <%Alazull> @PatStaresAt He hired her to go in your place knowing it was a trap and is now saving her from the trap, but suggests you follow just in case he fucks up?
[4:26:33] <+gustavozxd> this part of the game has TWO characters with the worst plans that fail horribly
[4:26:34] <%Pookiedaexzile> I mean A new Hope is about buying a slave
[4:26:35] <Sapphire_Breeze> @Dunmarkh they kinda do unironically with the whole kidnapping of children and indoctrinating them LUL
