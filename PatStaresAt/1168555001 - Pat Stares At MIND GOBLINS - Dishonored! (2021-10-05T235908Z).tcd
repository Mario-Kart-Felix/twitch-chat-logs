[0:16:48] <@ssjklyco> Comedian Cy Amundson mentioned it's like you are remembering a bad thing and you do something like enter and exit a door to replace those bad thoughts.
[0:16:51] <%dekkitout> Forgeting if you closed the door is a genuine concern
[0:16:52] <%trackles_64> So much stress
[0:16:53] <%Frost_Quill> Was it open?
[0:16:56] <$Ziegsy> Take a picture on your phone of you locking the door
[0:16:57] <HibikiYamada> oh god, the wait
[0:17:00] <+IHATREID> hey @PatStaresAt if u dont give a shit about a game do the mind goblino's still fuck with u
[0:17:02] <%trackles_64> in oyut tummothy
[0:17:02] <%Chichen> did you give birth to the goblin
[0:17:04] <+Chimeraelite> Yea thats why I always jiggle the door as I'm leaving. Gotta CEMENT IT
[0:17:05] <@GeneralSCPatton> For me, rarely a motion will just feel like I have to repeat it on the exact same trajectory. Failed attempts have to be undone first using a perfectly reversed trajectory. sbfpSetIn psaGoblin
[0:17:07] <TourettesPlays> Once made my dad drive back home for an hour because I thought I left the toaster on. I didn't, but youre sure as hell I told him it was
[0:17:07] <%barrakuta371> arcast1Oof
[0:17:09] <@PeachSaliva> Gotta rub Tummothy.
[0:17:11] <scrumbotime> It got you gobpreg
[0:17:11] <%maskofmichael> maskofmichael subscribed at Tier 1. They've subscribed for 24 months! Okay ma'am your total is 10.95. I said 10.95. No, 95 cents. That's a chip reader, you have to insert it. No, flip it around. Flip it the other way. It's asking if you want cash back. You just cancelled it ma'am. You have to insert it. The other way...
[0:17:12] <@Spydurman> and that's how you birthed the goblin dog
[0:17:12] <%Frost_Quill> But was it open?
[0:17:14] <comicalmond> u leave the house?
[0:17:15] <%BallerSwagBro9k> PREGANTE?
[0:17:15] <%KnifeyMcEdge> KnifeyMcEdge subscribed with Prime. 
[0:17:16] <%RealThiele> and it lives there to this day
[0:17:16] <Coystick> SAME fuck
[0:17:16] <cnry_m> My mind would be breaking at this concept
[0:17:17] <%Chichen> mpreg with goblin
[0:17:18] <DianaTheAscian> BUT WAS IT LOCKED?
[0:17:18] <%dekkitout> That sounds petty sane
[0:17:20] <%JoshManVGH> Did they ever call?
[0:17:20] <+Gamblor69> Yeah I do that too
[0:17:23] <%SinnerEbru> ahhh yes the tumm6 goblin. im VERY familiar w that
[0:17:24] <%Scarnehu> anxiety go psaBig  up!
[0:17:25] <%Treuan> I look at the lock and I say 'locked' to myself to try and snapshot it
[0:17:25] <%Nordguy> yeah
[0:17:26] <%cobalt_phoenix_> does it help if you verbally say it's locked?
[0:17:27] <%Ynkubus_> yep
[0:17:28] <+the_glizzy_wizzy> oh god
[0:17:32] <%HRDSalami654> This is why putting a smart lock on my house has been a godsend.
[0:17:32] <jcflyguy> Ah, I have that same goblin.
[0:17:32] <tijikiotecalt> take a picture of the door before you leave 5Head
[0:17:32] <%trackles_64> was it locked?
[0:17:33] <+bugz_munny> I do that sometimes
[0:17:33] <%hewlettfan96> Same fuck
[0:17:34] <tanarath> psaGoblin psaGoblin psaGoblin
[0:17:34] <%ahomeschooldropout> yes I did that
[0:17:34] <insomniac_doze_> PauseChamp
[0:17:35] <comicalmond> just the tip
[0:17:36] <@PeachSaliva> @Treuan I do that, too!!
[0:17:36] <%Dakuu75> get house cameras
[0:17:39] <%HRDSalami654> It used to happen to me all the time.
[0:17:39] <+SenorCounter> Use your key to lock
[0:17:40] <%hewlettfan96> Yes oh god
[0:17:42] <T_Sasquatch> I do that every morning LUL
[0:17:42] <Daebunz> i just check the knob as i start to walk away
[0:17:42] <%Chichen> w-what
[0:17:43] <mike2hands> I do the same
[0:17:43] <%Dova573> I do that whenever I clock in/out of work
[0:17:43] <%dekkitout> ....
[0:17:44] <+kingmemelord97> Jiggle the knob a few times
[0:17:44] <@Spydurman> LUL
[0:17:45] <%Scarnehu> you know, that one is pretty normal
[0:17:45] <BigFingerRo> @PatStaresAt my exgf would have to leave 3 full hours before going for work because sometimes the ocd would make her do her hair, hair by hair. I felt real bad for her.
[0:17:46] <cheapdoc> wut
[0:17:46] <GarbageQueenEllie> nice
[0:17:47] <%dekkitout> And there it is
[0:17:49] <+Vigonept> nah just dont care cause nornal people dont have enough to be robbed, like me!
[0:17:49] <DianaTheAscian> huh?
[0:17:50] <%cobalt_phoenix_> huh
[0:17:50] <Laecerelius> SPEEN!
[0:17:51] <Coystick> I leave a letter on the counter that says "I know you're here"
[0:17:51] <waltzqueen> oh no
[0:17:51] <whittacre> I just don't care if my house is locked
[0:17:52] <%crimsonharvest> you know what doesn't help in this situation (for me anyway) is the short term memory destroying power of weed
[0:17:53] <%Profmcstevie> Memory association
[0:17:53] <+SenorCounter> then clap 3 times
[0:17:54] <%Frost_Quill> I just try the door to see if it's actually locked once I close it.
[0:17:54] <+NecDW4> WHAT ARE YOU DOING
[0:17:54] <@Spydurman> it'll make you feel good
[0:17:55] <%Chichen> huh
[0:17:55] <%SaiyanShoto> If only houses could beep at us when they‚Äôre locked like cars do
[0:17:56] <+the_drummaestro> smart
[0:17:57] <%hewlettfan96> I have a tip psaWhat
[0:17:57] <jorniev> I CONSTANTLY WALK AROUND TRYING NOT TO FALL OVER cause of that one time i fell over and i could not get up
[0:17:57] <%SinnerEbru> what
[0:17:57] <+Laycas49> Patric trying to spread his OCD demons
[0:17:58] <@PeachSaliva> plz clap
[0:17:58] <+bugz_munny> BUT WHAT IF YOU FORGOT IF YOU SPUN
[0:18:00] <ElSuperNova> no need to walk ez
[0:18:02] <%bob900000> LUL
[0:18:03] <scrumbotime> skeleJarvis
[0:18:06] <%RealThiele> add +1 ritual
[0:18:09] <@Ranryu692> you're more likely to remember having done that
[0:18:10] <DianaTheAscian> @PatStaresAt until its not
[0:18:10] <whittacre> I've sat in my back room with my front door open until 3AM once
[0:18:11] <+DatGuyJimbo> your neighbours must love you LUL
[0:18:11] <TourettesPlays> I make a point to stop, and say outloud to myself "I AM HOLDING MY KEY IN MY HAND" to ensure I dont lock myself out of my house or car
[0:18:11] <+shadowsvrse> man when are house remote alarms gonna be creazted where you just press a button to unlock your house
[0:18:12] <%Willbo_Baggins> My coworker does a little dance every time he locks up the restaurant to remember
[0:18:12] <%Dakuu75> Pat doesn't flip the light switchs or wash his hands a lot... THIS is what his OCD makes him do... spin in circles
[0:18:13] <BisoromiBear> just scream LOCKED IT
[0:18:14] <%bevyrage> i clapped when i locked it
[0:18:16] <@Spydurman> what if you start clapping without locking the door?
[0:18:17] <%hewlettfan96> But what if u forgets how to spinz
[0:18:17] <+IHATREID> wouldnt it be easier to just consciously pay super attention to it so u remember clearly
[0:18:19] <%spitelite> but then it will become ordinary
[0:18:20] <ExpressNode> How about you just push the door and see if it locked properly before you left
[0:18:21] <%Profmcstevie> Easy to forget the mundane
[0:18:22] <shallaska> I do that to make sure I haven't forgotten to turn the oven off LUL
[0:18:22] <%bob900000> big brain üß†
[0:18:22] <IwishIwasTaylorSwift> when the spinning is done without thinking
[0:18:23] <T_Sasquatch> Yup
[0:18:23] <+AmanisHouseOfNonsense> Lock the door and get the clap, got it.
[0:18:25] <insomniac_doze_> new ritual acquired: jump or spin every time you close a door
[0:18:27] <OldManDeckardCain> BUT WHAT IF I SPIN ALL THE TIME
[0:18:27] <Guvzz> i take a photo with my phone
[0:18:27] <+Mrbaconator> "did i save my game let me save again 50 more times to be sure" @PatStaresAt
[0:18:31] <%BubbaRands> Create a goblin for your goblins
[0:18:32] <T_Sasquatch> Pat big right
[0:18:34] <Coystick> Goblin tech
[0:18:35] <allyalice> but then spinning becomes automatic and we're back at square one
[0:18:36] <Laecerelius> But what if you're so used to spinning that you forgot if you spun because it has become an automated action?
[0:18:36] <%Agami23> but then you spin in a circle in an automated fashion
[0:18:37] <%Frost_Quill> I genuinely don't remember flushing the toilet or turning my computer on most days.
[0:18:38] <%walternatorz> what if spinning in a circle becomes an automated thing?
[0:18:40] <%HRDSalami654> My  door plays a little tune when I lock it.
[0:18:42] <%twistedj3ster> what happens when the circle becomes ordinary
[0:18:43] <stealthfart> The OCD is strong. I always turn the knob and push to be sure
[0:18:43] <@Ranryu692> I've never had a front door that doesn't lock itself
[0:18:44] <%cobalt_phoenix_> @PatStaresAt but if you always do that doesn't that also become a background thing?
[0:18:44] <%KeiganOfAstora> totally makes sense
[0:18:47] <+bugz_munny> he actually big right on this
[0:18:48] <%chiazam> @patstaresat what if I forget that I spun around in a circle
[0:18:50] <+bugz_munny> I do this for my vitamins
[0:18:51] <%HRDSalami654> It is also set to lock automatically after 30 seconds.
[0:18:51] <%RealThiele> oops all automated brain
[0:18:51] <DianaTheAscian> LUL
[0:18:52] <%Fooguwu> or learn to meditate, so you can be acutely aware of things whenever you want
[0:18:53] <OldManDeckardCain> they are always looking
[0:18:53] <Coystick> Zangief think you're weird
[0:18:55] <@ssjklyco> Wouldn't that become a mundane activity to you after awhile?
[0:18:57] <%JoshManVGH> Before I close and lock the door, I do a "preflight check." Wallet, Brain (phone), keys? got them all? Shut door, shimmy the handle to double check, and leave.
[0:18:58] <%Dakuu75> lol that's aadorable, crazyness~
[0:19:00] <%Profmcstevie> Just say the dog likes it
[0:19:00] <T_Sasquatch> Until you do it so much that you forget
[0:19:00] <%holydeviant1> Eventually the spinning is automatic, so now you have to spin and clap. And then the clapping is on auto, so...
[0:19:01] <spongeofmystery> What happens when spinning in a circle becomes automated?
[0:19:04] <OldManDeckardCain> LUL
[0:19:04] <%Chichen> @Ranryu692 ive never seen a front door that locks itself
[0:19:06] <@PeachSaliva> The naked man is alway slooking.
[0:19:07] <%maskofmichael> Paige is looking
[0:19:07] <BigFingerRo> I'll adopt this new tech
[0:19:11] <%Frost_Quill> Until the circle thing becomes a background thing and you do it at another person's house without thinking.
[0:19:12] <+Docblargle> the zangief is gonna start doing it too you know
[0:19:12] <%castlerock42> They're looking right now.
[0:19:12] <@PeachSaliva> Creepy naked neighbor always sees.
[0:19:14] <%SpoonheadInExile> I always test the doorknob after locking
[0:19:16] <TourettesPlays> they may always be looking at paige, but not pat
[0:19:20] <%Chichen> well i already do that
[0:19:21] <%SinnerEbru> @joshmanvgh this is my solution too!! pre-check
[0:19:22] <+bugz_munny> lol
[0:19:22] <+DynDimAcsiwn> I got to the point where going back and checking the lock became automated
[0:19:22] <EasternEagle21> Wouldn't this just lead to you ritualistically hopping in place a bunch? That sounds like it would just make it worse. Response prevention is basically the only way to kill OCD anxiety without meds, hard though it might be.
[0:19:23] <%KnifeyMcEdge> i touch a chain at work when i walk by it every time.
[0:19:25] <EntropyArcade> after you condition yourself to automate the spin you add 1 more ritual each time
[0:19:25] <%ScreamLord> The you descend into lunacy
[0:19:26] <%shivhappy22> I text myself after I leave to remind myself I locked the door
[0:19:26] <%cobalt_phoenix_> but i already do that
[0:19:28] <Dopamien> thats already automated NotLikeThis
[0:19:29] <insomniac_doze_> doa the fortnite
[0:19:30] <+NecDW4> @PatStaresAt what if you accidentally spin without locking though? How do you REALLY know you actually locked the door?
[0:19:30] <blackjack8182> Are there any popular or recommended PC mods for Dishonored?
[0:19:31] <+Vigonept> but then you go to jail for jostling in public
[0:19:31] <ExpressNode> If this games tests your OCD like you say it does (because I never touched it so I don't know) its sounds like you will have a hard time
[0:19:33] <%Profmcstevie> They do need a lot of minor adjustments
[0:19:34] <%trackles_64> what if you have no arms?
[0:19:34] <%RayReborne> my lock is electronic so it makes a loud buzzing when it locks, so i remember the door is locked when i hear that sound
[0:19:37] <Laecerelius> Eventually it just becomes a dance routine every time you leave the house
[0:19:37] <+Mrbaconator> just jostle your balls in front of the neighbors
[0:19:37] <%JoshManVGH> @peachsaliva Is the same one that yells at you and Gief?
[0:19:38] <%lemon_rinds> But what if you can‚Äôt remember if you spun the last time or if it was a previous spin
[0:19:39] <%Nordguy> but i always touch my balls pat
[0:19:39] <Coystick> Jerk off in front of my house, got it!
[0:19:42] <%BubbaRands> Pull your pants up they‚Äôre looking right now!
[0:19:43] <scrumbotime> Just jack off whenever you lock your door, then you'll NEVER forget
[0:19:50] <OldManDeckardCain> I gues I would have to play fortnite on my phone
[0:19:51] <%spitelite> just shit your pants you wont forget that
[0:19:54] <%castlerock42> Yeah, do something unexpected. Like locking the door the first time around.
[0:19:56] <Anibaruthecat> seek help
[0:19:58] <%SaiyanShoto> You have sex with you SO in front of the door
[0:19:59] <PanicSwytch> This is next level mind goblins
[0:20:01] <Dreziv> @blackjack8182 not a ton but I like the Statistics mod
[0:20:10] <cheapdoc> No officer, I didn't stab someone because of CRIMES, I just needed to stop someone to kill my OCD. Wouldn't even get convicted
[0:20:12] <%dekkitout> Close your heart to it?
[0:20:16] <spongeofmystery> Something unexpected, like passing your keys from hand to hand, or firing a gun into the air, or yelling a racial slur in a foreign language
[0:20:20] <EasternEagle21> I know this because I too, have severe OCD, and holy shit it fucking sucks
[0:20:21] <%ahomeschooldropout> I forgot to hang up the house phone one day and my Mom freaked out 'cause she couldn't get ahold of me and left her job early, so now years later I still mash the hang up button
[0:20:22] <%ScreamLord> Dopamine?
[0:20:23] <@ssjklyco> At some point someone will just see you spinning in a circle, jostling your balls,  clucking  and other things for10 minutes everytime.
[0:20:26] <%AnIcedCoffee> AnIcedCoffee subscribed at Tier 1. They've subscribed for 29 months! Is EYE: Divine Cybermancy gonna be apart of your OCD series? I know several people who can't get past the character creator.
[0:20:30] <blackjack8182> @dreziv Thanks
[0:20:32] <%Frost_Quill> I'm not too bad, but I have some rituals.  I have to take 24 exact sips from a drink and I have to shake my body 24 times in the shower before using a towel to dry off.

[0:21:11] <%stubborndeer> MY obvious OCD sign is that I bake cakes methodically, I actually got fired and rehired seven times at the same place because I refused to stop mixing the flour before the sugar and then after etc, but I made the best cakes so they would always rehire me

[0:21:50] <EasternEagle21> Cognitive Behavioral Therapy, aka, make yourself really aware of what makes you anxious and when you are going through an episode, and then just like.. let it happen until it stops. Feel that anxiety until stops doing anything
[0:21:51] <+DatAsuna> I spent my degree making VR games for CBT lol Kind of a waste of time but it was something
[0:21:53] <%Frost_Quill> But NOT washing my hands make me anxious...

[0:22:09] <%SovPho> Surprisingly effective
[0:22:10] <+bugz_munny> Its more complex than that
[0:22:10] <%RealThiele> you did it

[0:22:16] <%TheHateFish> The worst thing is it fucking works
[0:22:16] <%cobalt_phoenix_> my mind is blown
[0:22:16] <TourettesPlays> SHEER TYRANNY OF WILL as Norm Macdonald would put it
[0:22:19] <PanicSwytch> Ok that i can not do
[0:22:20] <@Ranryu692> "Doctor it hurts when I move my arm"
[0:22:21] <%Teintstein> it takes a while to build up the habit
[0:22:22] <%BubbaRands> Make em dirtier Kappa
[0:22:22] <+SenorCounter> Doctor, I'm cured!
[0:22:22] <%Fenrisulfr_V> That sounds fucking useless.
[0:22:23] <ZeeJiggle> ..I think I'm gonna wash my hands.
[0:22:24] <%castlerock42> What if you actually have to wash your hands?
[0:22:25] <%KnifeyMcEdge> ooooooooh yaaaaaaaa
[0:22:26] <%JoshManVGH> Needs some damn willpower
[0:22:27] <ValkahRoctsteel> Wtf its that simple
[0:22:28] <%shivhappy22> the answer is always "count to 22"
[0:22:32] <waltzqueen> as a proponent of CBT, even i can admit that sounds bad
[0:22:34] <%hewlettfan96> Holy Shit that‚Äôs just woooooah
[0:22:34] <%mai_waifu_> But the invisible layer of spirit dirt won't go away NotLikeThis
[0:22:36] <%RealThiele> you gotta believe it can work
[0:22:38] <ElSuperNova> ah yes the other cbt
[0:22:40] <GarbageQueenEllie> It works, but changing behavior takes a looooong time
[0:22:43] <%crimsonharvest> its difficult yes especially if you have like rejection sensitivity from ND conditions
[0:22:44] <%spitelite> cbt is a pain in the balls
[0:22:44] <EasternEagle21> It's fucking hard to do. Everything about your anxiety and mental health problems you are trying to resist will make it actively harder to practice it
[0:22:46] <Laecerelius> @TourettesPlays That's a Dark Souls boss name!
[0:22:47] <%hewlettfan96> Fucking useless
[0:22:49] <+Mrbaconator> oh wow imagine your OCD makes you wash OTHER peoples hands LUL
[0:22:51] <%SovPho> ADHD deals with similar things.
[0:22:51] <@Ranryu692> it's the erosion method
[0:22:53] <liammichealryan> It's really damn hard, but god it's worth it.
[0:22:54] <TourettesPlays> having a journal full of compliments to yourself is some Buffalo Bill psycho killer shit
[0:22:55] <scrumbotime> Oh yeah, a big thing like that is "Don't talk shit about yourself, because you'll start internalizing your own insults"
[0:22:57] <%maskofmichael> Wait am I washing your hands?
[0:22:57] <cheapdoc> And that's how you become the pullout king
[0:22:57] <%athuramn> cbt works until your brain desensitizes the process
[0:23:01] <%Nordguy> delusional positivity us better than delusional negativity
[0:23:02] <%KnifeyMcEdge> BOOOOZZZZ

[0:23:18] <%Fenrisulfr_V> I've been in therapy for, like, 14 years now. Not a single thing they've ever tried has worked.

[0:23:39] <TourettesPlays> @solracc25 thats not an OCD thing then there's a justification for constant hand washing
[0:23:41] <%dekkitout> You could also channel your anxieties into creative expression...
[0:23:41] <Afterman_> remember @PatStaresAt you CAN KILL PLENTY. just not a bloodbath.

[0:23:53] <+Arnschen> Yup
[0:23:57] <Afterman_> that sounds eitherg ood or bad depending on the sex
[0:23:57] <%RealThiele> it sure does
[0:23:57] <@PeachSaliva> Pat has no problem with that LMAO
[0:23:58] <+DatGuyJimbo> in most cases it gives ED
[0:23:59] <oda_flobunaga> @PatStaresAt what happened the last time you tried Dishonored?
[0:23:59] <+Ches_Neckbeard> yeah but your brain wont be turbo broke!
[0:23:59] <BigFingerRo> Sex life or not insanity
[0:23:59] <%cobalt_phoenix_> no thanks
[0:24:00] <DianaTheAscian> @PatStaresAt so besides Dishonored what else did you pick for this?
[0:24:00] <%hewlettfan96> psaGoblin psaGoblin psaGoblin psaGoblin psaGoblin psaGoblin psaGoblin psaGoblin
[0:24:01] <scrumbotime> Hard to Nut, But now you want to live again
[0:24:02] <+ekodrop> you got some tea and calming food?
[0:24:02] <%Ynkubus_> yeah, the only cool part of the ssri
[0:24:02] <GarbageQueenEllie> Damn that's a bit too real
[0:24:04] <@PeachSaliva> hahahaha
[0:24:06] <insomniac_doze_> what sex life
[0:24:06] <@PeachSaliva> no
[0:24:06] <%bob900000> LUL LUL LUL
[0:24:06] <%Teintstein> LUL
[0:24:07] <Vyskus> can confirm I basically never nut anymore
[0:24:07] <%JoshManVGH> But what if nutting is YOUR antidrug?
[0:24:07] <BigFingerRo> hard choice
[0:24:08] <%Monkeyweed21> STAMINA MUST BE HIGH
[0:24:08] <blackjack8182> Minimum quick saves!
[0:24:08] <%Dakuu75> LOL~!!!
[0:24:08] <+Theherowithin> Yep
[0:24:09] <%cobalt_phoenix_> LUL
[0:24:10] <%Fenrisulfr_V> Taking too long to nut is the ONLY thing SSRIs have ever done positively for me.
[0:24:10] <namisrot> ssri withdrawal almost killed me last year lmao
[0:24:12] <%hewlettfan96> Anyone want a link to the Silk Road???
[0:24:12] <%GinAndRoses> LUL
[0:24:13] <+ReallyBigRocks> they don't like to talk about the sex problems
[0:24:13] <%castlerock42> Can't affect what I don't have.
[0:24:14] <%monsieurfantastic> what if you jerk really hard
[0:24:15] <ExpressNode> Gotta squeeze all the juice out before you go on the pill
[0:24:16] <+SenorCounter> yeah but /shrug
[0:24:17] <+RelikaNox> LUL
[0:24:17] <@Spydurman> @PeachSaliva nice. lmao
[0:24:19] <%bassoontyphoon> @patstaresat don‚Äôt remind me, lol
[0:24:19] <%Scarnehu> which has improved my sex life dramaticly
[0:24:20] <Afterman_> nut on the mustard, patrick
[0:24:20] <%ahomeschooldropout> Oh damn I was wondering why I took longer when I got put on Paxil lmao
[0:24:22] <%AnIcedCoffee> My ex was on SSRI's and it frustrated the fuck out of them during sex
[0:24:23] <comicalmond> god dam it paige
[0:24:25] <%chance_h> What sex life
[0:24:26] <%Fooguwu> they're good for preventing you from killing yourself, not for long term use imo. SSRIs are so bad
[0:24:26] <GarbageQueenEllie> Wait wait wait, playing Dishonored makes it harder for you to nut?
[0:24:27] <+ReallyBigRocks> also true
[0:24:27] <%Teintstein> true true
[0:24:30] <shallaska> Aw shit I started on SSRis a week ago
[0:24:36] <+the_glizzy_wizzy> yea i know
[0:24:38] <Anibaruthecat> or have an anxiety attack on camera...
[0:24:38] <+Arnschen> Oh yeah it *really* doesn't like it
[0:24:39] <spongeofmystery> SSRIs cons: affects sex drive. Pros: won't want to kill yourself quite so much
[0:24:39] <Vyskus> can also confirm, the brain fog is fucked up
[0:24:42] <+BigCoffee> whats ssris
[0:24:43] <%Nordguy> @crimsonharvest hey, how do you know that? asking for a friend :)
[0:24:43] <%Monkeyweed21> @namisrot good ol brain zap feeling?
[0:24:44] <%cobalt_phoenix_> @GarbageQueenEllie yes Kappa
[0:24:45] <Afterman_> @GarbageQueenEllie  dishonored is like an ssri, helps depression
[0:24:45] <@Ranryu692> If you're on SSRIs ecstasy won't work anymore, either
[0:24:45] <oda_flobunaga> probably not
[0:24:45] <scrumbotime> Oh I'm gonna LOVE it.
[0:24:46] <%hewlettfan96> What sex life
[0:24:49] <%Willbo_Baggins> What if you HATE it?
[0:24:50] <%ThomasOfTroy> Genuine question Pat, does the difficulty with orgasming on SSRIs also apply to women or is that mainly applicable to men?
[0:24:51] <DianaTheAscian> I feel like Lps might destroy you
[0:24:51] <OldManDeckardCain> so it's a one stream thing then
[0:24:53] <waltzqueen> @shallaska congrats
[0:24:54] <cheapdoc> That's the fun part, YOU WON'T
[0:24:55] <DanThePumpkinman> you won't like it lmao
[0:24:56] <miucsa51> this is gonna be good
[0:24:56] <maskedmook> those are the most important factors yes
[0:24:56] <%athuramn> @vyskus I feel that
[0:24:59] <bippityjones> I'm excited to be here to see Pat face Goblin 1
[0:24:59] <%RealThiele> you wont like it?
[0:25:06] <%KnifeyMcEdge> Dont think of the high chaos as a bad ending. problem solved
[0:25:12] <comicalmond> so playing once today and never going back to it
[0:25:16] <ExpressNode> That reminds me. I have to got take my medicine
[0:25:18] <$NoctisxMog> I assumed these are going to be one-shots
[0:25:24] <+DatAsuna> Timestop is busted OP in this game
[0:25:26] <%bassoontyphoon> Is dishonoured an immersive sim?
[0:25:26] <@Ranryu692> go full murder, it's the most fun way to play the game
[0:25:29] <%Profmcstevie> Murder stealth is king in all stealth games
[0:25:36] <@Ranryu692> and vengeful royal assassin makes sense
[0:25:36] <+DatAsuna> You have longer timestop than dio lol
[0:25:41] <%cobalt_phoenix_> @Ranryu692 hell yea
[0:25:43] <%Frost_Quill> Yeah you can kill all the targets and a surprisingly large number of guards before losing low chaos.
[0:25:44] <Laecerelius> Wasn't the main problem you were trying to both not kill AND ghost everything?
[0:25:50] <%bob900000> what!?
[0:25:52] <%Dr_Mooose> oh LUL
[0:25:54] <%GinAndRoses> that's a lot of subs!
[0:25:56] <kikoeru_san> FUCK NO
[0:25:57] <%RealThiele> it was hearts and shit
[0:25:57] <namisrot> @Ranryu692 but then samuel is sad...
[0:25:57] <$Ziegsy> The skeleton staring at us is kinda freaking me out
[0:25:58] <%sporeian94> That's some Jerma level debt
[0:26:01] <ZorenMaximus> LUL
[0:26:02] <%maskofmichael> Imagine 500 subs
[0:26:05] <kikoeru_san> No, not that Obari SHIT
[0:26:09] <%castlerock42> What a blas√© response to 500 subs.
[0:26:13] <spongeofmystery> @Ranryu692 It took me years to understand that my infrequent use of MDMA was supressing the Bad Brain and delayed me going to therapy for years, but also gave me the insight to know that I DID need to go to therapy, so swings & roundabouts I guess
[0:26:16] <ElSuperNova> High chaos stealth bby
[0:26:26] <DanThePumpkinman> did pat stream the smash thing?
[0:26:30] <%JoshManVGH> Huh!
[0:26:32] <%dekkitout> Science stuff
[0:26:32] <GarbageQueenEllie> Restless leg syndrome sucks
[0:26:32] <+Vigonept> nice opiods!
[0:26:40] <%Frost_Quill> @DanThePumpkinman Yeah like this morning.
[0:26:43] <%Ynkubus_> That would be nice
[0:26:45] <%RealThiele> unlikely
[0:26:47] <%KnifeyMcEdge> its whale juice
[0:26:49] <%SpontaneousC> Pat literally live on stream saying "Yes sir please give me ALL The drugs"
[0:26:50] <%Monkeyweed21> DOPIODS
[0:26:54] <%castlerock42> So the solution is drugs.
[0:26:54] <+cdrom321> @DanThePumpkinman He stared at a Nintendo thing earlier.
[0:26:54] <bear_breaker20> not for money?
[0:27:04] <%JoshManVGH> That would be cool of it's proven to work
[0:27:04] <DanThePumpkinman> @frost_quill cool I'll check it out later. thanks
[0:27:08] <+ReallyBigRocks> the high comes with a feeling of intellectualism because of the science
[0:27:11] <%monsieurfantastic> beam me up captain
[0:27:13] <%ThomasOfTroy> Science is rad, y'all see those spinach plants engineered to detect landmines? Shit's wild
[0:27:15] <%bassoontyphoon> ‚ÄúShoot me up in the ass‚Äù - Pat
[0:27:28] <%Frost_Quill> @ThomasOfTroy What the fuck.
[0:27:36] <%JoshManVGH> Aww big sleep
[0:27:37] <+FxyDEV> I couldn't even finish Dishonored 1 because I was just bored of playing non-lethally
[0:27:40] <scrumbotime> Smash Ultimater
[0:27:45] <%SveriSageAdvice> SveriSageAdvice subscribed at Tier 1. They've subscribed for 24 months! had my bike stolen from work and have a police report filed, but the business owner didnt buy good cameras, so there is a massive lens flare from a light across the street at night that covered everything. looking into an electric moped i guess now?
[0:27:46] <%cobalt_phoenix_> @ThomasOfTroy what how
[0:27:47] <%Xevtes> @ThomasOfTroy fucking what?! we taught spinach to narc
[0:27:49] <Laecerelius> Do the spinach plants like change color in response to absorbing something only land mines have or something like that?
[0:27:53] <%maskofmichael> Sora's in DBD?
[0:27:55] <%castlerock42> Sora's in DBD?
[0:27:58] <godzookylives> Sora for Dead by Daylight
[0:28:00] <%dekkitout> You both won the bet
[0:28:05] <%trackles_64> Doom guy was a Mii Charachter
[0:28:06] <DanThePumpkinman> wait people thought did was gonna get in smash? lol. lmao
[0:28:09] <person181> and you both lost
[0:28:09] <@PeachSaliva> Technically I won because my thing happened first.
[0:28:11] <%KnifeyMcEdge> YOU BOTH WIN
[0:28:11] <+NecDW4> Im still annoyed theres no Doomguyt
[0:28:11] <+skeletrail> Paige won
[0:28:13] <%twoto858> Sans got in first Paige wins
[0:28:14] <@PeachSaliva> I WIN
[0:28:17] <namisrot> paige won
[0:28:17] <miucsa51> LUL
[0:28:17] <@ssjklyco> They could have done more than "Look at me I'm flying " for the trailer
[0:28:19] <%Frost_Quill> Foxy would be great for DBD.  Foxy can run, can use his hook to slash, etc.  It's literally a better pick than Pyramid Head.
[0:28:20] <%abelincoln_catpuncher> @sverisageadvice yo dude I'm sorry, that sucks. just had a bike stolen a month ago
[0:28:20] <@PeachSaliva> Yeah
[0:28:25] <@PeachSaliva> My dick is the biggest
[0:28:25] <ElSuperNova> Mii fighter technicality
[0:28:27] <%Dr_Mooose> big dubs
[0:28:27] <@PeachSaliva> I did it
[0:28:28] <%KineticZen> Paige was right
[0:28:29] <DanThePumpkinman> dbd*
[0:28:30] <%Fooguwu> sounded like doom guy got a song
[0:28:30] <+NickHatesSnow> Paige wins harder
[0:28:31] <%JoshManVGH> Aww no Doom Music in smash!?
[0:28:32] <@PeachSaliva> THATS RIGHT
[0:28:32] <GarbageQueenEllie> Conglaturations
[0:28:33] <whittacre> they were playing doom music during the reveal
[0:28:33] <%Agami23> also people took the bet way too seriously and ruined it
[0:28:33] <%trackles_64> oof
[0:28:34] <scrumbotime> What did she win?
[0:28:35] <%Aleate> We shoulda gotten BFG division zubSAD
[0:28:35] <@PeachSaliva> YOU BET YOUR ASS
[0:28:35] <%bob900000> congratulations paige
[0:28:37] <%SirGO0SE> vargCBT vargCBT vargCBT
[0:28:37] <%castlerock42> Always bet on Paige.
[0:28:38] <%Profmcstevie> No doom song in smash, stings a bit
[0:28:38] <%SusieTomoe> Doom Guy's music played so I assume he'll get his song too
[0:28:39] <Midnight188> paige won because her taste is objectively more based
[0:28:40] <DanThePumpkinman> oh
[0:28:42] <Visorak6> But what if you're into the dick punch
[0:28:44] <%Monkeyweed21> do you even remember the terms of the bet
[0:28:45] <ZorenMaximus> LUL
[0:28:49] <mr_saturday93> her hand would probably break
[0:28:50] <%bravebravesrobin> As you may know, I work in a supermarket deli and I like to make quirky quips to customers.  Unfortunately, my choice of words to a VERY pretty woman I was talking to was "Excuse me, I'll be right with you, I just need to wrap my meat (I was cutting some meat).  I instantly knew once it came out of my mouth, but it was too late üò≠üò≠ Cheer500
[0:28:51] <namisrot> hell yeah paige punch that dick
[0:28:52] <@Ranryu692> this is one of those "you're not allowed to say that the all-women ghostbusters movie was bad without getting lumped in with the crazies" situations
[0:28:52] <%RealThiele> she waits till you sleep to do it?
[0:28:53] <@PeachSaliva> @Monkeyweed21 whoever wins has the best pee pee
[0:28:54] <DeadEyeArrow> She'll do that anyways

[0:29:43] <%SusieTomoe> idk DRK mains got a skill called Shadowbringer and i think that alone would have made everyone happy
[0:29:46] <+Arnschen> One on you, other on OT
[0:29:51] <+Saunt> what is oblation?
[0:29:53] <%ThomasOfTroy> For those asking, the spinach is engineered to emit Infrared signals that are triggered when it absorbs certain chemicals (explosives in this case) and that Infrared signal is then detected by a camera which alerts someone
[0:29:59] <RaidenRising> gnb chads rise up
[0:30:02] <%Monkeyweed21> at least its not SCH
[0:30:05] <%SusieTomoe> yeah but it sounds edgier

[0:30:26] <%cobalt_phoenix_> @ThomasOfTroy interesting, does that mean you have to plant a whole bunch in a minefield then let it grow?
[0:30:27] <peyodogo> hey is it time to delete goblins
[0:30:32] <Laecerelius> I knew it!  I knew it was because they absorb something!  Plants be like that.
[0:30:38] <%KnifeyMcEdge> im ready
[0:30:39] <+DatAsuna> Eh, Half of dishonored is great, half of it is hyper linear
[0:30:45] <+DatAsuna> dishonored 1, that is
[0:30:48] <GarbageQueenEllie> They killed the hot empress lady
[0:30:49] <%athuramn> that there's no incentive to be good lol
[0:30:52] <Calek> exploring to the best of my ability in a Dishonored level only to find out I missed half of the gold always bummed me out
[0:30:54] <theshillman> gobolins stream???
[0:30:55] <%Frost_Quill> I am so fucking sad we never got to go to the big magic continent in Dishonored 2.  The magic continent where all the cool cursed shit comes from, we hear all about it constantly, but we never get to see it.
[0:31:09] <SaltyAzteca> Hey here's all this cool magic powers you shouldnt use!

[0:31:10] <%twistedj3ster> the Unreal engine feels bad to move in

[0:31:13] <+DynDimAcsiwn> ah that explains a lot
[0:31:14] <%ThomasOfTroy> Iirc the chemicals are distinct enough and persistent enough that the spinach can detect traces of landmines from miles away
[0:31:15] <%BinaryFireball> raw berries are powerful
[0:31:19] <bear_breaker20> so hivemind added in the feature
[0:31:22] <%KnifeyMcEdge> save scum the fuck out of it so i was never seen
[0:31:26] <%BinaryFireball> wtf did I walk into?
[0:31:29] <+Kyma1020> sounds like a company mandate due to the popularity of morality systems during that era
[0:31:30] <%RealThiele> the good ending LUL
[0:31:30] <GarbageQueenEllie> I *like* choking ppl
[0:31:32] <+NickHatesSnow> oh I hate afterthoughts
[0:31:34] <brunoberserk> but pat , if all your goblins die , you will FADE AWAY
[0:31:39] <spaghetti_tomorrow> !Dishonored
[0:31:41] <%SpontaneousC> that makes sense as to why Dishonored 2 feels better too, it's actually designed with it in mind
[0:31:43] <taquito_blade> lol
[0:31:46] <%SusieTomoe> Eureka is fine now shhh
[0:31:46] <javsomeclass> Kinda like when you realize you don't need to kill your wife in 12 Minutes?
[0:31:47] <%cobalt_phoenix_> oh you poor sould
[0:31:49] <Treasure_Vault> Killing should have been the good ending. The pacifist ending should have been an ultra-perfect utopia ending.
[0:31:50] <%Frost_Quill> Oh yeah I still need to finish Eureka...
[0:31:52] <+Arnschen> YESSSS
[0:31:52] <Laecerelius> BUT WHY THO?!?!
[0:31:53] <%drabberfaun535> Did pat ever finish moon crash?
[0:31:53] <T_Sasquatch> This is the most ive related to pat about a game. It's so weird
[0:31:53] <+bluedude153> !abort
[0:31:53] <ElSuperNova> And then in Deathloop, they finally said FUCK IT
[0:31:54] <%SovPho> so that literally means doing anything good in dishonored is not cannon that's rough
[0:31:55] <SaltyAzteca> STOP YOU FOOL
[0:31:56] <Finakala> Better than Pagos
[0:31:57] <T_Sasquatch> Rip
[0:31:58] <%JoshManVGH> That's unfortunate.
[0:32:01] <+MajorCrasher> why worse? it only effects the ending @patstaresat
[0:32:02] <%SpoonheadInExile> The second game is improved, because they give you more nonlethal options
[0:32:03] <cheapdoc> It's a shame when you don't want to assassinate people in your assassin game
[0:32:06] <DianaTheAscian> I also started doing that
[0:32:06] <%Treuan> OOH
[0:32:09] <+Saunt> there was 300 people
[0:32:14] <%KineticZen> There are runs every day scheduled in multiple Discords, it's fine
[0:32:15] <%shurtal> I"LL GET THERE, YOU CAN"T TELL  ME I WONT
[0:32:17] <Aydarkzero> but content
[0:32:17] <Calek> I thought BA was at the end of Eureka
[0:32:20] <+Saunt> well BA has that nice discord
[0:32:22] <+bassforte123> God the worst part about Eureka is it SUCKS when you're low level and it makes you low level 4 different times
[0:32:23] <Archmortal> Baldesian Arsenal is perhaps the worst thing in all of FFXIV
[0:32:24] <%JustynRen> it hurts
[0:32:24] <%cobalt_phoenix_> i haven't started that yet, but want to eventually
[0:32:24] <+victhebeard> is pat gathering guide on YouTube?
[0:32:25] <+Arnschen> I'm scheduled for a BA this week, it doesn't seem too bad.
[0:32:26] <T_Sasquatch> I need that monk eureka fist dude
[0:32:33] <Saltmeisterr> WTF ARE YOU PEOPLE TALKIN ABUT

[0:32:45] <%Monkeyweed21> @shurtal YOU DONT KNOW HOW NONSENSE BA IS
[0:32:45] <%RealThiele> every day i feel better about skipping Eureka
[0:32:45] <%JoshManVGH> Hopefully that sub just saved someone days of their life.
[0:32:50] <Rionxgarland> goin thru yakuza 4 right now

[0:32:53] <%Frost_Quill> @Saltmeisterr Final Fantasy XIV.
[0:32:57] <%TDotGoat> can I have one raspberry?
[0:32:58] <DeadEyeArrow> But everyone else hates it
[0:32:58] <%KnifeyMcEdge> I wonder if there is a mod for Dishonored where they put the good ending cutscene where the bad ending one is?
[0:32:59] <%Profmcstevie> I wish I loved Raspberry texture
[0:33:00] <%BinaryFireball> oh fuck rasberries? those are the hairy fruit
[0:33:03] <GarbageQueenEllie> Are the raspberries fuzzy?
[0:33:03] <DeadEyeArrow> who do I believe
[0:33:05] <+bassforte123> I went through all of Eureka in about 5 days, I'd believe it has a MASSIVE exp buff
[0:33:18] <Aydarkzero> wut
[0:33:21] <+victhebeard> is Pat's ff14 gathering guide on YouTube?
[0:33:21] <%SpoonheadInExile> YUP

[0:33:26] <%SirGO0SE> its so good
[0:33:26] <Finakala> It's a good ep
[0:33:30] <%MelBrooksKA> Ripe raspberries own, ones that go bad suck
[0:33:31] <Saltmeisterr> wtf is a BA?
[0:33:38] <Laecerelius> All because of fucking BARCLAY!

[0:33:51] <+victhebeard> @w1ntertitan thx
[0:33:51] <+Mizzda> a friend of mine showed off some nice fashion from Eureka, it's tempting to resub and get into it
[0:33:54] <%Frost_Quill> @Saltmeisterr Baldesion Arsenal.  It's a raid.
[0:34:00] <Treasure_Vault> I hope Paige loves Enterprise.
[0:34:01] <+SubxXxZero> !mindgoblin

[0:34:04] <+TheUltrahumanoid> If your trying to prove to an entire kingdom that you're not a murderer killing half a city and all it's leading political figurers probably won't help your case
[0:34:05] <+bassforte123> @Saltmeisterr It's the final mega raid in Eureka that takes like 7 groups coordinating
[0:34:07] <+kingmemelord97> The chaos system in dishonored 1 was so stoped i played and beat it once and never touched it again , you get punished for playing a assassin in a  assassin
[0:34:13] <Laecerelius> Gotta go bite Diana's amphibian lady face
[0:34:15] <%SusieTomoe> BA is better to play but worse to get a group for
[0:34:19] <%JoshManVGH> Why was Berkly tagged for all the weird ass shit episodes like that.
[0:34:23] <godzookylives> @PatStaresAt Barclay Spider scared me as a kid
[0:34:24] <%cobalt_phoenix_> @Saltmeisterr Baldesion Arsenal, it's part of series of side content that's pretty grindy, with what's essentially just cosmetic items now
[0:34:24] <+SubxXxZero> What are mind goblins?? NotLikeThis
[0:34:32] <%bassoontyphoon> Did you hear about shatner going to space???
[0:34:32] <%SharkMissile> Wait WHAT
[0:34:33] <%Monkeyweed21> @Saltmeisterr Baldesion Arsenal, the Eureka end raid that is total bullshit and requires a group of 20-40 people to coordinate
[0:34:35] <$Futurecity10> cause trails fucking sucks
[0:34:36] <brunoberserk> you and plague need to do a top 10 best TNG episodes , yes like redlettermedia LUL

[0:35:00] <+tricksterricky> Hey Pat wanna know something shitty? I tried doing a no kill run in Dishonored years ago and I spent the whole game doing things perfectly only to not get the achievement, turns out enemies falling into water when you knock them out counts as killing them.

[0:35:05] <Brandon__Brando> oh dis is going to be gud
[0:35:06] <%Frost_Quill> @PatStaresAt The most goblin-inducing game is FFX-2, making the dialogue go faster makes you lose out on the 100% completion.  You can easily miss 90% of the game without realizing it too.

[0:35:21] <%sporeian94> The most fucked up part is I helped her with her groceries like a week ago and she was talking about how weak she felt lately
[0:35:22] <+NecDW4> @PatStaresAt So, is the point of this series to NOT goblin? Are you going to be intentionally ignoring extra stuff like side poaths and hidden shit?

[0:38:35] <Visorak6> @ReallyBigRocks florida
[0:38:41] <%Monkeyweed21> the worst is that they give you a 20 and then fish out $1 in coins so you can give them a 10 back

[0:39:16] <Jetsfantasy> That's rough, buddy
[0:39:16] <%TheHateFish> E.Y.E has 32-player mutliplayer with the ability for each player to summon five clones of themselves. Combined with the FULLER AUTO gun, this makes for almost enough dakka.

[0:40:01] <+NickHatesSnow> would you do it for shit candy?
[0:40:02] <%SpontaneousC> #scrumbotime Because that's the max source can manage.
[0:40:02] <Jetsfantasy> Anyone buying family around here?
[0:40:03] <wolfen091> Turkish delight is some euro shit
[0:40:04] <%maskofmichael> Only sellout if it's a big number
[0:40:05] <Blu_C> It was WWII man. The sugar rationing made anything sweet drive the kids wild.
[0:40:08] <CanadianAnimatorGuy> kid gives his family to the witch lady for turkish delight, it's fucked
[0:40:09] <Ozavic> I like it honestly, but it is a weird flavour
[0:40:09] <PanicSwytch> Id sellout my family for free
[0:40:10] <SaltyAzteca> @scrumbotime Why dont other games have 32 multiplayers
[0:40:10] <%Profmcstevie> For a box of stale crackers psaDab
[0:40:12] <Explodincatz> for how much?
[0:40:13] <Blu_C> Also, they are british. They don't know what good tastes like.
[0:40:14] <T_Sasquatch> Narnia is pretty old man
[0:40:14] <mr_saturday93> you really have a poor relationship with him don't you?
[0:40:15] <%castlerock42> Pat, what's the minimum you'd sell someone out for?
[0:40:15] <s1rcuit> blood don't equal family folks
[0:40:16] <%trackles_64> D:
[0:40:19] <%BoxNavy> he loves it
[0:40:19] <%StebTheVee> It's thick jello and tastes bitter
[0:40:21] <%TheHateFish> @scrumbotime Because E.Y.E is a special experience that nothing else replicates. It's 32-player co-op, too
[0:40:23] <maskedmook> lmao
[0:40:24] <%dekkitout> Luckily I have older twin sisters, so I could cash in on something huge tajC
[0:40:24] <DianaTheAscian> I'd sell out my family in a second
[0:40:25] <%JoshManVGH> Just LOAD up the evidence for them
[0:40:29] <peyodogo> fair, family aint shit lmao
[0:40:30] <%bassoontyphoon> Man the pats brother lore is perpetually intriguing
[0:40:31] <ExpressNode> The way he looked at the camera

[0:40:47] <%Xevtes> omg dude
[0:40:49] <taquito_blade> Turkish delight is like marshmallows of gelatin desert snacks
[0:40:51] <%trackles_64> Do you even have a brother?
[0:40:56] <%JoshManVGH> He likes a big drug.
[0:40:58] <%cobalt_phoenix_> if you were in the us that's basically calling a hit on your brother
[0:40:59] <%Frost_Quill> I heard he has many marijuanas on him.
[0:41:00] <taquito_blade> wait..
[0:41:00] <DianaTheAscian> He has tons of guns in his room
[0:41:03] <%maskofmichael> "What are you gonna do, shoot me?" - Pat's brother before getting shot
[0:41:03] <%ShogunNoonto> don't get him shot
[0:41:04] <+NecDW4> Retail Goblin stuff. The other day at work, we changed the way we print shipping labels from the machine MEANT to print them that hold a roll of 1000, to mobile printers that hold rolls of 100. We also only got ONE box of the correct lables that run out daily. We ALSO ALSO arent able to order more. To top it off, the mobile printer cant recognize the old size of lable, so everything gets printed half on two different labels.
[0:41:04] <%TheHateFish> Shit like this is why I'm glad to be an only child

I appreciate that you're still one of the things that give my life normalcy since then. Thanks for entertaining me the past ten years.
[0:42:33] <Aeroallways> it's so hard to hit the time limit in that game that when I went to look for any evidence of one I couldn't find any videos of it

[0:46:58] <+Arek_1> LUL
[0:46:59] <@Ranryu692> rats can't swim, but they can walk over the floating corpses of their drowned brethren
[0:47:00] <%drabberfaun535> If you send the rats into water they DO die!
[0:47:02] <%BallerSwagBro9k> @joshmanvgh We do a little cursing
[0:47:03] <%valriot> They actually can't in this I'm pretty sure
[0:47:03] <scrumbotime> Seagulls pick up rats to carry them to other continents
[0:47:04] <CubeyXOF> all these characters look so warped
[0:47:06] <ExpressNode> So anyone see that weird PS3 shit saying at the end of this month you can't use your credit card to buy games anymore except using their gift cards?
[0:47:07] <%SinnerEbru> RAT PLAGUE
[0:47:09] <Laecerelius> So just England
[0:47:09] <DianaTheAscian> @PatStaresAt how do rats not sink the boats if they can't swim?

[0:47:41] <%BallerSwagBro9k> Ye like 1800 England
[0:47:43] <lloyddboy> THEY USE BRITISHISMS IN THE SCRIPT
[0:47:44] <Dreziv> artstyle makes the low-ish graphics work very well
[0:47:44] <@ssjklyco> I see why not
[0:47:46] <%valriot> Yeah its weird LUL
[0:47:46] <%superc37> TBH i actually really like that for the unncannyness
[0:47:46] <%SpontaneousC> Still not as bad as assassin's creed unity's vision of paris where everyone is British
[0:47:47] <+DatAsuna> @blackjack8182 Agreed 2 making him speak was a big improvement
[0:47:47] <OldManDeckardCain> it's just england under labour (only slightly worse than tories but still)
[0:47:50] <TourettesPlays> Celebrity voice actors = inflating games budget by millions for no good reason
[0:47:50] <lloyddboy> IT'S SO WEIRD
[0:47:51] <%castlerock42> This game was made entirely by late decisions.
[0:47:57] <%bassoontyphoon> British = psaBig psaWrong
[0:47:59] <%hewlettfan96> Fuck You I‚Äôm British I love IT Here!!
[0:48:00] <Lolaylaou> they got Carrie Fisher, then had her play an incredibly minor optional role
[0:48:00] <Brutusness> whats all dis den

[0:48:12] <gtl1220> @patstaresat a england that is part Japanese and started hunting wales
[0:48:13] <GarbageQueenEllie> It's SOOO obvious

[0:48:27] <$realm_forge> ALLO GOVNA

[0:48:38] <%SusieTomoe> most shitty children would just cry and whine
[0:48:39] <%castlerock42> Pat, just because she looks and acts like you doesn't mean she's your child.
[0:48:41] <+ReallyBigRocks> it's cool that she got a bow tattoo to match her choker
[0:48:41] <%ScreamLord> A bodyguard wouldn't be THIS familiar and intimate with his charges
[0:48:42] <%W1nterTitan> hello Chloe Grace Moretz
[0:48:43] <%Agami23> she's wearing a neck ribbon to hide the seam connecting her neck and body

[0:54:13] <jorniev> IT WAS REALLY STUPID
[0:54:17] <+Dawndeather> And Dorvo speaks in 2
[0:54:18] <DXLelouch24> Going pacifist or kill them all Pat?
[0:54:21] <Blackleafx> YEAH GARRET IN SYSTEM SHOCK
[0:54:21] <ElSuperNova> I like theyre basically just YEAH WE DID IT LUL
[0:54:22] <%maskofmichael> System Thief
[0:54:25] <SaltyAzteca> What's a Crono?
[0:54:25] <+Vigonept> but people love the new Vegas man not talking
[0:54:26] <%castlerock42> Yes, it's fucking stupid. Let FPS protagonists talk!
[0:54:27] <+MisterAvry> talking protagonists are better
[0:54:27] <@Ranryu692> I think the way XIV does it is weird
[0:54:29] <%valriot> Yeah Corvo talks in 2 alot
[0:54:30] <+Donchalant402> fake fan fake fan
[0:54:32] <miucsa51> SIN SUFFERED FROM THAT TOO
[0:54:32] <feefer_drunk3rland> same art director for HL2 btw
[0:54:32] <%sporeian94> the system shock 2 guy had literall 1 line and it's the best line ever
[0:54:33] <Dreziv> and then the protag voice acting in 2 is really lame
[0:54:33] <MrBaldachin> Silent protagonists that are actual characters are bad, it's only fine when you're playing a blank slate
[0:54:38] <%GustauveVIII> needs more death
[0:54:39] <+DatAsuna> The dumb shit was them in interviews talking about how "corvo is gonna destroy gordon freeman in the history of silent protagonists"
[0:54:39] <%Logoth_> Eat this lump of food substance
[0:54:42] <%BallerSwagBro9k> I HATE mute protagonists
[0:54:43] <CappuccinoGuil> @jorniev yeah, there is one that made me scratch my head, because it was like "kill them or turn them into possibly a sex slave to a fanatic"???
[0:54:44] <jbrachob> doesnt Daub talk in the DLC?
[0:54:45] <GarbageQueenEllie> If you go High Chaos, the ending is more "fun" imo
[0:54:47] <%superc37> baby
[0:54:48] <Madinki> @DatAsuna It's really not that different.
[0:54:49] <@PeachSaliva> pee pee
[0:54:52] <MidnightPacif1c> BABY
[0:54:52] <%emperordread> psaElmo psaElmo psaElmo
[0:54:53] <%Mr_Pylon> The rats aren't bald so clearly the rats are good
[0:54:53] <%TDotGoat> psaGib
[0:54:53] <cholesteroid> peepeeee
[0:54:54] <+FxyDEV> miaow
[0:54:58] <tubit> it's elmo baby
[0:55:02] <%Monkeyweed21> pat knows where Garret is from right?
[0:55:02] <Mirrorcatch> emlo blessing
[0:55:03] <%SinnerEbru> emlo
[0:55:03] <+skeletrail> Peepee!
[0:55:03] <T_Sasquatch> Kat
[0:55:04] <%A_Zealous_Retort> FFXIV protag just speaks REALLY quiet and everyone guesses what they said and moves on
[0:55:05] <+Dawndeather> Mute protagonists are fucking stupid, which is why I HAATE Link
[0:55:05] <+Donchalant402> does anyone actually like mute protags?
[0:55:08] <%RayReborne> @patstaresat But Pat, HOW are you forcing the goblins to come out?
[0:55:10] <lloyddboy> confession: i got this game for the TF2 hat and I didn't even play spy. At least I enjoyed it!
[0:55:10] <+DatAsuna> Like there was a need to shit talk half life 2 for whatever reason while also drawing comparisons
[0:55:12] <jbrachob> EAT THE KEY
[0:55:13] <cheapdoc> Skyrim yourself out
[0:55:14] <%KnifeyMcEdge> i think you would like the Daud DLC
[0:55:14] <marvel877> Ah, yes, sequels where the silent protag suddenly talks, like Jak 2, Dishonored 2, and Dead Space 2.
[0:55:16] <+Dawndeather> Elmo boy
[0:55:18] <Blu_C> Let the goblins begin.
[0:55:19] <%drabberfaun535> Did they ever fix dishonored 2 for pc?
[0:55:19] <%BallerSwagBro9k> @garbagequeenellie Big agree. The final level is is way more fun
[0:55:21] <+MisterAvry> lax security around here
[0:55:25] <%superc37> wat
[0:55:29] <%SpontaneousC> @Donchalant402 it worked in Half-life, Metroid Prime, and Doom. that's about it
[0:55:31] <Brandon__Brando> how is he playing this stealth or kill
[0:55:34] <%BlondieFDM> What if you just stayed in the cell and didn't play any other part of the game? psaWhat
[0:55:38] <GarbageQueenEllie> @BallerSwagBro9k And Emily's High Chaos lines are GOLD
[0:55:39] <+Vigonept> thats a nice background
[0:55:39] <+MisterAvry> good. good.
[0:55:39] <+skeletrail> That is a really cool mask
[0:55:40] <%SinnerEbru> ooooh
[0:55:48] <Dunmarkh> KILL EVERY MOTHERFUCKER IN THIS PRISON
[0:55:49] <T_Sasquatch> right par ew
[0:55:50] <%BallerSwagBro9k> @drabberfaun535 The bugs? Yes. The meh story? No
[0:55:52] <+ReallyBigRocks> a sneaky man icon
[0:55:54] <Vashido22> the mask design still FUCKS
[0:55:56] <%valriot> @drabberfaun535 I was playing it yesterday, I crashed once in 20 hours but that was it
[0:55:56] <+Dawndeather> Monies
[0:55:56] <%RayReborne> oh yeah the stealth icon
[0:55:58] <CappuccinoGuil> @Donchalant402 only under the condition where they are blank slates or created. Like in Dark Souls.
[0:55:59] <Vashido22> like goddamn I love that mask design
[0:56:01] <Jetsfantasy> limesKnife KILL limesGun
[0:56:08] <cholesteroid> goblins: begin
[0:56:08] <%Arkfyre> tuned for lean

[0:56:26] <Vashido22> OK
[0:56:27] <CappuccinoGuil> Okay, so what's Pat's plan here to fight his goblins? Kill everyone?
[0:56:27] <+Shin_Doom_Bot> how you feeling today pat!!!?
[0:56:28] <Lolaylaou> hope the goblins don't require 100% coin collection, cause that's a real pain to do in this
[0:56:28] <Brandon__Brando> how is the panic already kicking in?
[0:56:28] <%SharkMissile> Murder them all
[0:56:28] <DianaTheAscian> KILL
[0:56:29] <%Agami23> KILL
[0:56:30] <+MisterAvry> murder time
[0:56:30] <Vashido22> WHAT WILL YOU DO PAT

[0:56:35] <@DakotaMacDoodle> Spin to win Pat Spin to win!
[0:56:36] <jtsoppy137> Here we go
[0:56:38] <lloyddboy> KILL. CHAOS.
[0:56:39] <Blackleafx> GOBLIN TIME
[0:56:40] <+Shin_Doom_Bot> all is kill
[0:56:41] <%KnifeyMcEdge> KILL THEM. DO IT
[0:56:43] <T_Sasquatch> I am totally with you pat !
[0:56:44] <+DrFacilier> just do it tho
[0:56:44] <Dreziv> do whatever you want shrug
[0:56:44] <ElSuperNova> lethal stealth
[0:56:45] <PinkSocks> honestly killing is just more fun, go for it
[0:56:46] <GarbageQueenEllie> A coups deserves no less than TOTAL ANNIHILATION
[0:56:46] <Afterman_> story choices, not benefits tbh
[0:56:47] <%SpontaneousC> IT TOTALLY DOES
[0:56:50] <%SpontaneousC> I had that problem too
[0:56:50] <spongeofmystery> @jetsfantasy NO limesKnife
[0:56:50] <jorniev> WHY DID THEY EVEN TELL YOU
[0:56:51] <miucsa51> And so it begins...
[0:56:51] <MidnightPacif1c> KILL CHAOS
[0:56:51] <+Vigonept> KILL THEM ALL PAT
[0:56:53] <AvroEltz> Do whatever, doesnt matter
[0:56:54] <+Amripai> FUCK ALL THAT SHIT KILL
[0:56:55] <%emperordread> Instructions unclear
[0:56:55] <%Agami23> yup
[0:56:56] <%RayReborne> GOBLINS YOOO HOOOOO
[0:56:56] <+pectusumbra> It's like a thresh hold isn't it?
[0:56:57] <+RyTYoung> S T E A L T H I S F U N T H O
[0:56:57] <SaltyAzteca> "Stealth is optional"
[0:56:59] <LoneFonte> BECOME CHAOS
[0:56:59] <%stubborndeer> WHEN YOUR COUNTRY ASKS YOU TO DELETE GOBLINS WILL YOU ANSWER THE CALL
[0:57:00] <+skeletrail> You are correct
[0:57:01] <%A_Zealous_Retort> not to mention it marks chapters you ghosted
[0:57:05] <feefer_drunk3rland> K I L L
[0:57:05] <MrBaldachin> you can have a healthy amount of kill, but not too much
[0:57:05] <Calek> it does do that, it all depends on the average for the game
[0:57:05] <+DatAsuna> yeah it's all thresholds/milestones
[0:57:05] <CatRidder> CAHOS
[0:57:06] <Dreziv> I don't think the phrasing is like that at all
[0:57:06] <+Shin_Doom_Bot> can you unkill in this game?
[0:57:07] <%BlondieFDM> KILL EVERYTHING
[0:57:08] <%BallerSwagBro9k> Its not that much different
[0:57:08] <CubeyXOF> there's a kill threshold
[0:57:09] <28moogles> It's... not?
[0:57:10] <+RyTYoung> P L A Y Y O U R W A Y
[0:57:11] <+skeletrail> That is how it feels
[0:57:11] <tolloponik> do you want to have fun or have the story be good
[0:57:13] <%tyler274> rats tjp
[0:57:14] <%cobalt_phoenix_> blind
[0:57:15] <%LeiaSkynoober> @pectusumbra It is, but the problem is that it's not clear
[0:57:19] <+rafaelba93> fianl mission is fun on high chaos
[0:57:21] <Madinki> LOOKS LIKE CHAOS IS WAITING FOR US!!!!
[0:57:22] <%emperordread> little rit rats so cute
[0:57:22] <%maskofmichael> How did they not see that?
[0:57:23] <%valriot> Its not everyone, but I believe the thresholds are 20% and then 50%
[0:57:25] <Brandon__Brando> how did they not see that
[0:57:26] <blackjack8182> God, I hate morality systems!
[0:57:27] <%tigerfang86> they'll NEVER SEE YOU
[0:57:28] <jorniev> THERE should have been a non lethal melee
[0:57:29] <%SharkMissile> That sound is just from HL2
[0:57:29] <%tigerfang86> EVER
[0:57:33] <Dreziv> the shadows don't do anything
[0:57:34] <%Tman451> Thats fucked, thats the main reason why I bounced off this game
[0:57:35] <%GustauveVIII> @PatStaresAt Does Pat know that leaning doesn't change your initial position in terms of sight mechanics?
[0:57:36] <%Fooguwu> KILL THEM PAT. KILL THEM ALL.
[0:57:38] <OldManDeckardCain> oh god I forgot how much dishonored stealth sucked LUL
[0:57:42] <%SusieTomoe> i love the other prisoner who isn't like "let me out" hes just like "get his ass"
[0:57:43] <%Logoth_> Strangle people for 5 seconds and that knockks them out
[0:57:43] <GarbageQueenEllie> InvisiBLESSED
[0:57:44] <%SpontaneousC> Kills also leave behind blood stains so that's an actual mechanic
[0:57:45] <%twistedj3ster> I hate that seirn sound
[0:57:47] <%stubborndeer> HE WAS STILL AWAKE
[0:57:48] <+RyTYoung> Yeah shadows don't do much
[0:57:50] <DianaTheAscian> WHOS TALKING?
[0:57:50] <%SpontaneousC> or was that only in 2
[0:57:52] <@ssjklyco> So they are genome soldiers?
[0:57:52] <%JoshManVGH> Might as well BE invisible.
[0:57:52] <%stubborndeer> HE JUST TALKED
[0:57:54] <+DrFacilier> If i remember right killing and stealth stuff doesnt even matter in this first escape mission
[0:57:55] <some_brave_apollo> the high chaos ending is actually better than the low chaos one
[0:57:55] <+Shin_Doom_Bot> Unlife them pat!!
[0:57:58] <Visorak6> Do the LEAN
[0:57:59] <T_Sasquatch> ironically my solution to the dishonored thing was just ghosting everything LUL
[0:58:00] <%emperordread> @logoth_ tbf most stealth systems suck
[0:58:02] <%superc37> stealth is a lot better once you get the powers tbh
[0:58:04] <mr_saturday93> I remember that thr guards have really shitty vision
[0:58:05] <%stubborndeer> YOU AREN'T EVEN KILLNIG THEM
[0:58:10] <%doc_ock_rokc> KILL THEM ALL PATTER
[0:58:10] <%baka_sugoi> early 2010 stealth
[0:58:11] <Anibaruthecat> hey it's indiemaus, hi indiemaus
[0:58:11] <Laecerelius> Do the big murder, Pat!
[0:58:12] <bippityjones> Prisoner 6 feet away: Yeah fucking assassinate that guard! Guard: *whistle*
[0:58:15] <%JoshManVGH> It was SO DUMB that lean by default breakes stealth in Dishonored 2
[0:58:16] <%G_Thunders> High Chaos ending is rad. It‚Äôs not a punishment
[0:58:16] <%ReenMan350> take their pants
[0:58:18] <Laecerelius> MURDER!!!
[0:58:18] <CappuccinoGuil> @PatStaresAt what's your plan to fight your goblins in this game? Just muscle through or kill everyone, what's the game here?
[0:58:18] <+FxyDEV> cuddlepile

[0:58:24] <%ScreamLord> Dear god, what happened that guy's face!? WutFace

[0:58:36] <@Moobot> @polothegreatest I've been playing this game for how long? Oh only 58m 51s.
[0:58:38] <%xcompleasedad> LUL the Prisoner is just watching you
[0:58:38] <Vashido22> OH THATS
[0:58:38] <LVL1_Scumbag> I give  him an hour

[0:58:42] <T_Sasquatch> bruh
[0:58:44] <CubeyXOF> roll with the failures?
[0:58:44] <%BallerSwagBro9k> @emperordread Still haven't found better Stealth than Chaos Theory
[0:58:44] <Mirrorcatch> GUN
[0:58:45] <%doc_ock_rokc> He doesn't want to GHOST
[0:58:46] <28moogles> It's not about killing them, it's about living with your failures.
[0:58:48] <+RyTYoung> I went non lethally the first time through, sleep darts were the shit
[0:58:48] <GarbageQueenEllie> Ohohohoooo. I see!
[0:58:49] <jtsoppy137> monkaS
[0:58:50] <%emperordread> hard save and hard load every single encounter until they are perfect
[0:58:50] <Dreziv> you can get away with killing like. 20 dudes per mission. So you can be lax as hell.
[0:58:52] <%AyotoCorp> I didn't realize this game HAD quicksave/quickload
[0:58:53] <+NecDW4> @PatStaresAt are you still going to hoard?
[0:58:54] <jcflyguy> Oof, best of luck
[0:58:55] <tolloponik> no Quick load! in this type of game?!
[0:58:55] <+the_glizzy_wizzy> oh no
[0:58:56] <@ssjklyco> What about slow load?
[0:58:58] <%Daxalog> So your playing the game the intended way?
[0:58:58] <akitanito> learn to live with chaos
[0:58:58] <%AnIcedCoffee> If you quickload, does Paige come in and punch you in the balls?
[0:58:58] <T_Sasquatch> i legit dont think i can do that
[0:58:59] <CappuccinoGuil> OH WOW, OKAY, I'M IN
[0:59:00] <Dreziv> yaay

[0:59:24] <+victhebeard> all of Pat's training has lead him to play Dishonored again. the anime has come full circle.
[0:59:25] <%SveriSageAdvice> holy shit you did it
[0:59:25] <Treasure_Vault> Are you still allowed to quicksave for game over insurance?

[1:02:37] <+victhebeard> you got this üëç
[1:02:37] <+skeletrail> I feel ya man
[1:02:39] <%sporeian94> You know the ironic part is pat is probably playing the game as the devs intended in a way...
[1:02:40] <%Nahual_Amini> You're gonna carry that weight
[1:02:40] <Blu_C> If they valued life they wouldn't work here.
[1:02:40] <%G_Thunders> Just pretend it‚Äôs Deathloop1

[1:02:48] <wendigo172> Pat is actually dying while playing my favorite game uhnKek
[1:02:50] <Mirrorcatch> you had to kill them all, for their own good
[1:02:52] <%emperordread> Attention Bjoran Workers
[1:02:54] <%LeiaSkynoober> They're cops so it's okay
[1:02:54] <Dreziv> @PatStaresAt shadows don't factor in detection calculations
[1:02:54] <%Monkeyweed21> @PatStaresAt you arent invisible in shadow
[1:02:56] <$realm_forge> This is about increasing your tolerance! YOU GOT THIS!!
[1:02:57] <CappuccinoGuil> Pat, you can do this, I spent a portion of the game killing every guard because I was mad and I STILL got a good ending.
[1:03:03] <maskedmook> how dont they see you?
[1:03:05] <ElSuperNova> Never trust the "shadow" stelath
[1:03:10] <+RyTYoung> There's no darkness mechanic Pat
[1:03:11] <%GarbageNirvana> So what happens if you kill everyone EXCEPT the targets
[1:03:15] <+RyTYoung> Just line of sight
[1:03:20] <ZE_Count> nice 50 coin
[1:03:26] <DSD24> Corvo has the coolest Mask
[1:03:27] <+skeletrail> Thank GOODNESS they left all these waist high walls sitting out
[1:03:27] <bippityjones> Why do they have waist high cover everywhere like this is a third person shooter?
[1:03:34] <jtsoppy137> he can smell ya
[1:03:37] <DrStinkers> HAH?
[1:03:41] <Laecerelius> One Guy needs to be taken out
[1:03:44] <%SpontaneousC> @GarbageNirvana More than 25% of the level population causes the chaos to go up regardless of what you do with the target
[1:03:44] <%ashenfrenzy> ashenfrenzy subscribed at Tier 1. They've subscribed for 45 months! 
[1:03:48] <%JoshManVGH> Nope
[1:03:48] <%ReenMan350> yup
[1:03:49] <@Ranryu692> IT'S TUNED FOR LEAN
[1:03:50] <%superc37> wow this is a rly shitty prison ngl
[1:03:52] <lloyddboy> LEANVISIBLE
[1:03:52] <%JoshManVGH> In 2 they can
[1:03:53] <%Monkeyweed21> no
[1:03:54] <%cobalt_phoenix_> yea that's the point of leaning
[1:03:54] <Finakala> Like every game with lean
[1:03:55] <PinkSocks> not completely
[1:03:55] <%GabeSweetMan> Nope, leans are and should ALWAYS be invisible.
[1:03:56] <%polothegreatest> throw a coin LUL
[1:03:57] <Blackleafx> Leaning doesnt count as visible
[1:03:57] <Lolaylaou> yeah, invisible leaning in the first game
[1:04:00] <+RemedyofRevenge> was that the Deadly Premonition stinger sound effect?
[1:04:00] <+RyTYoung> yup
[1:04:00] <s1rcuit> @DSD24 isn't it like a mechanical bird mask?
[1:04:00] <+Donchalant402> tuned for lean
[1:04:02] <ElSuperNova> YEP
[1:04:05] <%SharkMissile> This game is balanced for lean
[1:04:05] <%valriot> I like how they use the guards coughing to give them audio location to the player
[1:04:07] <%ScreamLord> Balanced foir Lean
[1:04:07] <ElSuperNova> CHANGES IN D2
[1:04:08] <%Wallabri> invisilean
[1:04:10] <%KnifeyMcEdge> better than detective vision... which this game also has
[1:04:14] <shameimarusen> \_ean
[1:04:15] <Blackleafx> shoot his kneecaps
[1:04:15] <%xcompleasedad> Leaning making you invisible is KEY to the game
[1:04:23] <%JoshManVGH> How does one stand like that I wonder
[1:04:23] <%A_Zealous_Retort> that is a HUGE lean like damn you just want to peek around a corner not go breakdancing
[1:04:26] <CubeyXOF> @RemedyofRevenge It was!
[1:04:28] <Blackleafx> nomnom
[1:04:30] <%doc_ock_rokc> @PatStaresAt You are playing GHOSTFACE
[1:04:30] <lloyddboy> nomf nomf nomf
[1:04:31] <%GabeSweetMan> Detective Vision has ruined puzzle solving in 3d environments.
[1:04:32] <Visorak6> Eat EVERYTHING
[1:04:34] <%cobalt_phoenix_> monch
[1:04:34] <+RyTYoung> I was big sad when you I found out you couldn't lean down in Deathloop NotLikeThis
[1:04:36] <+MisterAvry> coins
[1:04:38] <%stubborndeer> READ THE SIGN
[1:04:38] <ZE_Count> man I love dishonored. 2 is even way better
[1:04:39] <Laecerelius> Just shove taht food down your mouth hole, Pat
[1:04:39] <%emperordread> Leaning / peeking always seemed like a mechanic that's never worked in any game except Rainbow 6
[1:04:40] <+MisterAvry> coins by lever
[1:04:41] <Treasure_Vault> Pretend his lean and shadow powers are actual magic
[1:04:42] <%Faustgesicht> the buff ghostface desparately needs
[1:04:44] <%valriot> its TUNED FOR LEAN
[1:04:49] <jbrachob> Look up
[1:04:53] <%GabeSweetMan> So many games took detective vision and just highlights solutions in neon orange. I hate it.
[1:04:53] <cherryburnout> I don't think you are 100% invisible when leaning
[1:04:56] <spongeofmystery> That is like Rainbow 6 Siege levels of lean
[1:04:57] <%xcompleasedad> @PatStaresAt Don't eat food unless you are missing health.
[1:04:57] <Lolaylaou> sequels have options between visible, invisible, and slightly visible leaning
[1:05:04] <%Agami23> but pat, what if they wake up? you should kill them all
[1:05:05] <ZE_Count> content pat
[1:05:06] <akitanito> he's talking to himself
[1:05:14] <bippityjones> Not the Bottle Street Boys!
[1:05:15] <%JoshManVGH> @cherryburnout You are for sure in 1.
[1:05:17] <%tank7013> how did he not see that
[1:05:19] <%Scarnehu> shoothim
[1:05:22] <blackjack8182> You missed some coins on that table
[1:05:23] <CappuccinoGuil> Chat, I'm so sad, I dropped one of the sausages I was cooking on the ground, but I guess my dog is happy because he gets cooked sausage, so it balances out
[1:05:27] <+RemedyofRevenge> Its so polite of the guards to be quiet when getting choked out
[1:05:27] <%W1nterTitan> They sure make a lot of noise
[1:05:29] <ZE_Count> lol that sign
[1:05:29] <%Ziegsy> So couldnt you lean the bodies against the wall and theyd be invisible?
[1:05:33] <%ace_cfa44> is the magic technology based or just magic?
[1:05:40] <s1rcuit> I missed it did Pat explain his plans for this game in terms of the takedowns and kills?
[1:05:42] <AvroEltz> wow these guys are terrible guards, they deserve to die pat
[1:05:52] <DrStinkers> finally a game where the enemies are more blind than pat
[1:05:53] <pacibuddy> @ace_cfa44 just magic but theres also special tech
[1:05:53] <+RyTYoung> @cappuccinoguil gotta make another sausage to make up for your loss
[1:05:59] <ZE_Count> its tuned for dat lean.
[1:05:59] <+MisterAvry> that's a clean lean
[1:06:03] <$realm_forge> BYBTHE POWER OF LEAN
[1:06:04] <%xcompleasedad> @s1rcuit He's not quickloading. That's all we know
[1:06:04] <%stubborndeer> Why do you keep killing everyone in this house pat
[1:06:04] <%superc37> @ace_cfa44 whale oil based technology. magic is completely different.
[1:06:05] <%Ziegsy> Are you completely invisible while leaning?

[1:10:47] <+JustToWatch> @InhumanMilitia did you mean outer wilds
[1:10:47] <%dekkitout> Worlds, no. Wilds, yes.
[1:10:47] <+bugz_munny> Man i wish it was
[1:10:47] <%SusieTomoe> Now Outer Wilds that is a must buy
[1:10:47] <DSD24> Has Pat been Dishonored yet?
[1:10:48] <DianaTheAscian> worlds or wilds?
[1:10:49] <+wumpy3d> the outerwilds though
[1:10:49] <%Ne1son> Outer Wilds though super is
[1:10:50] <+Vigonept> its a firm 5/10
[1:10:52] <@Ranryu692> mmmmmmm whale
[1:10:55] <%KeiganOfAstora> What about Outer Wilds
[1:10:56] <%Agami23> outer wilds is a must by at all times especially when its not on sale
[1:10:58] <%Ziegsy> Is outer WILDS- there we go
[1:11:00] <+ReallyBigRocks> Wilds, yes. Worlds, no.
[1:11:01] <%SpontaneousC> the answer to both is no
[1:11:02] <%baka_sugoi> SEWER FOOD
[1:11:04] <%Valdorick> Big Dumpy
[1:11:04] <%BallerSwagBro9k> DLC is good
[1:11:06] <+victhebeard> always eat sewer snacks
[1:11:10] <jtsoppy137> dump zone
[1:11:11] <+InhumanMilitia> nope worlds
[1:11:12] <OldManDeckardCain> I wouldn't get outer worlds even if they paid me LUL
[1:11:12] <+NecDW4> @PatStaresAt HUH, apparently Pekora is gonna be on Radio Mog Station
[1:11:13] <Treasure_Vault> I hate that Outer Worlds/Outer Wilds still confuses me
[1:11:13] <%valriot> huehue dumps
[1:11:13] <%JoshManVGH> And yet, the cops can dump away
[1:11:13] <%GustauveVIII> is outer worlds that bad?
[1:11:15] <+bugz_munny> Outer Wilds is a buy and then give the developer more money
[1:11:15] <comicalmond> enigmaKEK
[1:11:16] <%GarbageNirvana> I would wait on Outer Worlds 2 and see if that's even worth it or if it's just more of the same
[1:11:17] <%mister___doctor> Buy Fallout 4 instead
[1:11:19] <akitanito> give bodies as distraction
[1:11:19] <@ssjklyco> Wow this is topical
[1:11:20] <TourettesPlays> outer worlds = red headed step child of New Vegas Outer Wilds = artistic masterpiece
[1:11:20] <+bugz_munny> And then more money if you could
[1:11:21] <+SmigGames> why don't you like Worlds?
[1:11:23] <biglomix> They don't belive in the vaccine
[1:11:29] <ExpressNode> Gotta dump your loads somewhere
[1:11:29] <%Valdorick> Guys... do you think... feeding the plague infested rats... MIGHT NOT BE HLEPING THE PLAGUE!?
[1:11:31] <%rumtumtugnutz> Outer Worlds isn't even a must buy free on Game Pass
[1:11:42] <jtsoppy137> ?
[1:11:42] <lloyddboy> 2B busy
[1:11:44] <%GarbageNirvana> Worlds is basically New Vegas but without all the cool stuff New Vegas had
[1:11:45] <blackjack8182> Outer worlds was mediocre
[1:11:48] <%baka_sugoi> did dishonor predict the TIMELINE?  sbfpSetIn
[1:11:53] <theshillman> this is just like the covids
[1:11:57] <miucsa51> Rats rats
[1:12:04] <+MisterAvry> "temporarily"
[1:12:08] <+MisterAvry> cocky aint they
[1:12:08] <DSD24> Wait did we get our cool mask yet? Or are we still man face
[1:12:12] <$FriedMattato> I tried getting into Outer Wilds, but my own brain goblins made me feel like any progress / direction was horribly unclear
[1:12:15] <wolfen091> I liked worlds, you just gotta not compare it to new vegas
[1:12:22] <%superc37> ah yes, eat the delicious delicious plague rats
[1:12:27] <%castlerock42> Why are people hanging propaganda in the sewers?
[1:12:32] <%dks_junkie> am I just the outlier for actually enjoying Outer Worlds
[1:12:39] <+prote_ousia> the way to do outer wilds is to complete the journal.
[1:12:43] <%BoxNavy> like a rat
[1:12:46] <Brutusness> to radicalize the rat
[1:12:47] <%baka_sugoi> swewer ppl
[1:12:47] <jtsoppy137> i would live in the sewers
[1:12:49] <+prote_ousia> that's how I measured my progress.
[1:12:51] <comicalmond> and the lizard people
[1:12:52] <Jetsfantasy> Melty Blood players
[1:12:53] <scempriss> Is pat going full chaos or stealth?
[1:12:54] <+ReallyBigRocks> why hang propaganda in your own house?
[1:12:56] <+Vigonept> rats and trash and trash and rats
[1:13:00] <intestinal_bleeding> rat rat RAT RAT RAT
[1:13:00] <DSD24> @dks_junkie Nah you are fine dood I thought the game was pretty good as well
[1:13:04] <cheapdoc> I didn't know there was an entire civilization of waifus
[1:13:04] <IronGlorfindel> with the tr√¶sh
[1:13:05] <+SmigGames> I really liked Outer Worlds
[1:13:06] <+ReallyBigRocks> wouldn't you wanna put it on other peoples houses?
[1:13:06] <%Ziegsy> Me? Propaganda  ziegsyGaga
[1:13:07] <%TIME_PUNCHER> the sewers will rise again
[1:13:08] <%castlerock42> That's fair.
[1:13:08] <%cobalt_phoenix_> @scempriss neither
[1:13:11] <%BallerSwagBro9k> @dks_junkie Nope I also like it and I dislike Outer Wilds LUL
[1:13:12] <BurdRightsActivist> Does this game take place in Br*ttan?
[1:13:13] <Dreziv> the first bomb tripped the wire
[1:13:15] <%SpontaneousC> @ReallyBigRocks Why do Americans hang flags in their own house
[1:13:16] <Dunmarkh> @scempriss he's not quicksaving, he gets what he earns
[1:13:18] <miucsa51> woe rat be upon ye
[1:13:19] <DSD24> Here we goooo
[1:13:20] <Laecerelius> Here's your cool shit!
[1:13:21] <CappuccinoGuil> @dks_junkie I like it too, but it definitely is lacking in a lot of places. Not really fun to replay.
[1:13:23] <%SpontaneousC> people just DO that shit
[1:13:29] <PinkSocks> folding sword
[1:13:29] <%SharkMissile> Dishonored always had good base kit
[1:13:31] <djblue_shift> love that crossbow
[1:13:36] <%rumtumtugnutz> Outer Worlds wasa good game, I just don't think it was a must anything.
[1:13:43] <+prote_ousia> what does the mind goblins mean in this context?
[1:13:45] <+MadScientistMike> @PatStaresAt just spent an unreasonable amount of time trying to figure out New Vegas mods. As a beginner, this shits hard
[1:13:50] <jtsoppy137> stinky darts
[1:13:50] <BurdRightsActivist> Nice sword, but don't use that though that's bad
[1:13:51] <+meatmaaan> sleep darts op
[1:13:55] <+MisterAvry> make em a sweepy boy
[1:14:10] <DSD24> I love the folding sword
[1:14:10] <zetsubouman> monch
[1:14:11] <spongeofmystery> I spent far too long learning how to do the sword spins irl
[1:14:12] <TG_Cid11> shoot the with the heroin dart
[1:14:12] <%BoxNavy> eat can
[1:14:22] <%tank7013> @prote_ousia Actually using resources and items, not playing perfectly, not quickloading
[1:14:37] <%SinnerEbru> @madscientistmike check out the viva new vegas mod suggestions, thats the only reason i could play it this year
[1:14:41] <%A_Zealous_Retort> @prote_ousia no quicksave/quickload, so deal with getting caught in stealth sections or having to kill someone or use a consumable
[1:14:42] <%rumtumtugnutz> @prote_ousia Pat's desire for zero chaos makes this game impossible for him to enjoy.
[1:14:44] <jorniev> 0451
[1:14:47] <Dreziv> fun fact: if you hold the sheathe button and press your left hand button while you're sheathing you can put your sword away and keep your left hand out
[1:14:47] <%BoxNavy> ü•É moon2W
[1:14:49] <+OrangeMDT> Corvo is a hungry assassin
[1:14:49] <some_brave_apollo> 451
[1:14:51] <jtsoppy137> u daft m8
[1:14:58] <%JoshManVGH> SHADOW PUZZLE
[1:15:04] <MrBaldachin> THE NUMBER
[1:15:06] <DSD24> Its the code
[1:15:08] <spongeofmystery> GUESS THE CODE PAT
[1:15:09] <MrBaldachin> THE MEME NUMBER
[1:15:12] <%castlerock42> This puzzle doesn't help the System Shock/Bioshock comparison.
[1:15:13] <oda_flobunaga> 0451
[1:15:14] <%BoxNavy> how ddi you find that dude
[1:15:14] <+prote_ousia> thanks everyone! yeah this game triggered my mind goblins too because it's just almost impossible to play without quicksaving for me.
[1:15:15] <%notsoy> why is it always 451 anyway? what started it
[1:15:15] <Laecerelius> IT'S A REAL IMMERSIVE SIM!!
[1:15:16] <+Vigonept> DA CODE
[1:15:17] <+the_glizzy_wizzy> 0454
[1:15:18] <DSD24> Its a reference to Farenheit 451 right?
[1:15:20] <%SpontaneousC> old habits die hard I guess
[1:15:21] <%cobalt_phoenix_> I M M E R S I V E
[1:15:23] <%twoto858> YEYEYE
[1:15:23] <%holydeviant1> What is that in reference to? THe number itself, I mean
[1:15:24] <Dunmarkh> I AM IMMERSED
[1:15:29] <blackjack8182> 0451
[1:15:31] <BisoromiBear> laputan machine
[1:15:31] <some_brave_apollo> it's not 0451
[1:15:33] <oda_flobunaga> DEUS EX
[1:15:34] <@Ranryu692> ooooooh
[1:15:36] <ElSuperNova> TRUE I SIM
[1:15:36] <Thepothero> So immersive
[1:15:37] <some_brave_apollo> and deus ex isn't the first one
[1:15:38] <MrBaldachin> it was even before deus ex, it was system shock 1
[1:15:41] <some_brave_apollo> it's from system shock 1
[1:15:42] <%twistedj3ster> You hear that Adam? 0451
[1:15:44] <theshillman> NO ITS NOOOOOT
[1:15:44] <HotMafia81> These loot sounds are nice
[1:15:44] <+bugz_munny> What a shame
[1:15:45] <@ssjklyco> That seems random though
[1:15:46] <%tank7013> 0451 strikes me as some "The cake is a lie" tier shit
[1:15:47] <%BoxNavy> more like deu sex (do sex)
[1:15:48] <%SpoonheadInExile> NO, it's because of a Film school door code
[1:15:49] <TheFramedWarlock> In System Shock 2 they use 45100
[1:15:50] <%Daxalog> wasnt it System Shock 1?
[1:15:50] <+bugz_munny> He was a good man
[1:15:50] <%SinnerEbru> ohhhhh
[1:15:51] <@GeneralSCPatton> It was actually the code to get into their offices at the time
[1:15:51] <%superc37> and its a reference to farenheit 451
[1:15:51] <some_brave_apollo> and its a reference to fahrenheit 451
[1:15:52] <%Profmcstevie> Keep the joke going
[1:15:53] <Ravioli_Ronin> Nerds love Fahrenheit 451
[1:15:53] <%Agami23> memes
[1:15:55] <+DatAsuna> immersive sim is a genre, even if the name is bad
[1:15:55] <+MadScientistMike> @SinnerEbru I'll check that out. thanks!
[1:15:56] <Nero270> An Immsersive sim is when you 0451
[1:15:59] <TheNewJapanGuy> I didn't realise that that's awesome
[1:16:02] <theshillman> AAAAAAAAAA
[1:16:03] <%valriot> Its not in Preys first safe which I found funny
[1:16:04] <HotMafia81> 0451 was the front door code for Looking Glass Studios
[1:16:05] <liammichealryan> nope, it was System Shock one
[1:16:06] <scempriss> It's actually just been one giant coincidence
[1:16:08] <DSD24> Slit his throat Pat
[1:16:10] <%KeiganOfAstora> The one keypad in Batman: Arkham Knight I think was 0451
[1:16:12] <%castlerock42> Which I'm pretty sure is a Fahrenheit 451 reference.
[1:16:17] <+MisterAvry> it's cruel, but sound advice
[1:16:20] <%emperordread> Drop bear
[1:16:23] <%addMoreCoffee> Still my favorite Arkane game.
[1:16:25] <blackjack8182> KILL
[1:16:26] <Laecerelius> BIG murder time!
[1:16:27] <DSD24> Clean
[1:16:27] <%KeiganOfAstora> Nevermind, it was 0539
[1:16:31] <HotMafia81> Not a Fahrenheit 451 reference as many people assume
[1:16:33] <%Agami23> breath
[1:16:33] <%SpontaneousC> You can do none lethal drop attacks in 2
[1:16:33] <miucsa51> 0451 is from system shock
[1:16:34] <+Docblargle> yeah sorry pat that only kills
[1:16:35] <+bugz_munny> ITS GONNA BE OKAY
[1:16:36] <+MisterAvry> and he didn't follow it, died without a peep
[1:16:36] <%cobalt_phoenix_> doesn't count it's ok
[1:16:37] <intestinal_bleeding> WORMS
[1:16:40] <%SpontaneousC> Never mind that you break their fucking spines
[1:16:40] <%BoxNavy> peepee water
[1:16:40] <+prote_ousia> it is crazy to think that stealth games are built around knocking people out, but in real life if you knock someone out they're out for like a minute at the most, because otherwise it's just permanent brain damage/coma
[1:16:41] <$vehementvadr> murder
[1:16:42] <Ravioli_Ronin> Down+B enemies for the big kill
[1:16:43] <xxshadowxx416> is pat choas
[1:16:43] <biglomix> I think cyberpunk stole all of these stealh mechanic
[1:16:43] <+MisterAvry> amateur
[1:16:43] <Dre_> Kill them all Pat
[1:16:44] <%SpontaneousC> it's totally none lethal
[1:16:49] <%xcompleasedad> @SpontaneousC AND THEY ARE SO GOOD
[1:16:51] <%DedlokPM> It's a reference to Deus Ex which it self was a reference to Farenheit 451 which the title of was the reference to the temperature needed to burn books
[1:16:52] <%valriot> So in D2, you can do stealth take downs that way
[1:16:54] <spongeofmystery> super dumb there's no nonlethal drop attack
[1:17:01] <jtsoppy137> haha stinky
[1:17:05] <blackjack8182> He‚Äôs just sleeping!
[1:17:05] <intestinal_bleeding> FURRY TRASH
[1:17:05] <%emperordread> "Furry filth" LUL
[1:17:06] <DSD24> Oh no not the furries
[1:17:07] <intestinal_bleeding> lol
[1:17:07] <T_Sasquatch> kill em all
[1:17:11] <BurdRightsActivist> Furry D:
[1:17:15] <%SharkMissile> I love how this game is very beatable with the base skill set
[1:17:16] <%GabeSweetMan> Haha, furries are stinky.
[1:17:16] <ExpressNode> Must be smash players
[1:17:20] <intestinal_bleeding> don't make fun of my ratsona >:[
[1:17:52] <DSD24> Samuel is a nice guy
[1:17:55] <%BoxNavy> NOT bald? DansGame
[1:17:57] <Dreziv> kiss him on the mouth
[1:17:57] <Therusher> People thought it was a ref to ferenheit 451 but one of the looking glass guys came out and said it was literally the door code to their office.
[1:17:59] <+prote_ousia> I love saying 'I'm a friend.' so trustworthy
[1:18:01] <+wumpy3d> baldness is a sign of uniformity
[1:18:02] <+meatmaaan> samuel is the best
[1:18:03] <jtsoppy137> he has a scar
[1:18:04] <scempriss> Theres maybe one good bald guy
[1:18:04] <%castlerock42> His fashion sense is evil.
[1:18:06] <+wumpy3d> duhhh
[1:18:07] <Laecerelius> LEZ GO!
[1:18:08] <oda_flobunaga> Outsider confirmed not evil then?
[1:18:13] <%SharkMissile> The background lore for this game is so cool
[1:18:15] <%emperordread> Reload, get gold
[1:18:19] <%chance_h> Nonletal take down enemy‚Äôs and feed them to the rats for best ending
[1:18:19] <Dunmarkh> OH WELL

[1:18:22] <%superc37> you ignored a LOT of coins
[1:18:23] <Laecerelius> Well you didn't murder those guys so they might've had gold on them
[1:18:23] <DSD24> See Low Chaos Pat
[1:18:23] <%Dylveryn> There was a big chest under Samuel's boat
[1:18:23] <oda_flobunaga> Replay it for completion then?
[1:18:25] <AvroEltz> ye, you arent exploring everything
[1:18:25] <Dunmarkh> @emperordread no

[1:18:39] <%Monkeyweed21> @PatStaresAt you missed tons of coins
[1:18:42] <+DatAsuna> gold is everywhere, not worth getting all of
[1:18:43] <%valriot> Each level has tonnnns of gold
[1:18:48] <%cobalt_phoenix_> doesn't matter
[1:18:48] <BurdRightsActivist> A Nonlethal Take Down is always the most silent take down. GEP Gun, Always the GEP Gun
[1:18:49] <ElSuperNova> TOO MUCH TO BOTHER
[1:18:52] <+DeadlyPeaks> Time ti restart
[1:18:54] <+wumpy3d> is it hard yet?
[1:18:56] <DaCheekyOne> Did I miss pat having a mental breakdown?
[1:18:59] <IronGlorfindel> Kinda funny how killing a bunch of dudes spreads the plague when that's like, HALF of a whale corpse
[1:18:59] <+MisterAvry> breathe, Pat

[1:20:49] <%xcompleasedad> That rubber beer
[1:20:51] <%ReenMan350> psaBig plans
[1:20:56] <DSD24> @BurdRightsActivist The Art style between the two games is super similar

[1:28:42] <%GabeSweetMan> It's fine for items, I just wish games would stop abusing Detective Vision to make puzzle solutions glow in orange neon.
[1:28:43] <%SovPho> also, I like the "button to temporarily ping/outline" things

[1:37:38] <%JoshManVGH> Is he the Stranger in Paradise?
[1:37:38] <Blu_C> It just struck me that The Outsider gives off serious goth highschool kid vibes.
[1:37:38] <blue6sub6remnant6> Is that Garland?
[1:37:39] <+Donchalant402> not suspicious at all
[1:37:40] <%mr_sups> This looks like an oblivion cutscene
[1:37:41] <Coystick> @addMoreCoffee I' only playing it because I read there's a Shalebridge Cradle-like level
[1:37:41] <%BestTeaMaker> the BEST MOVE EVER
[1:37:41] <ZeeJiggle> Aw man he sounds way cooler in this.
[1:37:42] <%SovPho> He looks like such a pud of a god though like why he look like that.
[1:37:43] <+sonofrobin73> Kinda wish the outsider wasn't just some dude. Would rather an incomprehensible monster
[1:37:45] <%Sir_Gawain_Lotsson> yes
[1:37:46] <%strakillias> This guy is supposed to look evil with his black eyes but the face models in this game are so bad he just looks like everybody else.

[1:38:35] <%A_Zealous_Retort> I dunno the need to pee sounds like a goblin to me
[1:38:37] <%Sir_Gawain_Lotsson> @polothegreatest There's like 7 class prereqs
[1:38:37] <@Ranryu692> @polothegreatest KH3 is nonsense as the first KH game you play
[1:38:40] <RickyRelucent> you'd have to go a long way to fuck up a blink spell
[1:38:40] <CappuccinoGuil> The Outsider is a god damn edgy dweeb and I *will* bully him and then kiss his face
[1:38:44] <xxshadowxx416> kh3 you need to play 1 and 2 and ......

[1:38:59] <%addMoreCoffee> Starting bets now, did Pat pee is big boy pants?
[1:39:06] <blue6sub6remnant6> Is it more brave to be unafraid to piss yourself, or more foolish for dirtying yourself unashamedly?
[1:39:17] <%RayReborne> Guys if Pat slides during running back for a goblin fix, its called a Goblin Slide ‚Ñ¢
[1:39:18] <%SharkMissile> I love this song
[1:39:19] <%Ziegsy> @oda_flobunaga ff14
[1:39:41] <+sonofrobin73> Well, blink would suck without ledge grab. I'd say thats easy to f up
[1:39:43] <%MelBrooksKA> @blue6sub6remnant6 Only cowards pee
[1:39:46] <%RealThiele> yea FF14 blink is just drag your character model along the floor
[1:40:15] <blue6sub6remnant6> I'm a coward on my toilet confirmed.
[1:40:19] <%RayReborne> death loops blink is amazing, makes that game addicting to run through
[1:40:32] <%RayReborne> movement wise

[1:41:44] <%MidnightBurst12> first boss encountered
[1:41:44] <+Dawndeather> But fuck it
[1:41:46] <$Futurecity10> @PatStaresAt You know you can cheat engine infinite mana potions?
[1:41:46] <%RealThiele> BULLSHIT
[1:41:48] <jorniev> FOR a second i thought he started back from the beginning
[1:41:48] <@commanderclaw> You can complete the whole game using no mana potions, so keep that in mindd
[1:41:48] <%BoxNavy> oh yeah i can see that
[1:41:48] <stormhawk9891> But you only have 85 of them
[1:41:50] <@Ranryu692> then you'll have to get your hands dirty
[1:41:50] <Coystick> But they place them in the level FOR THOSE ENCOUNTERS
[1:41:51] <Therusher> Isn't there an inventory cap on them that's fairly low? Can't remember.
[1:41:53] <ElSuperNova> I love doing time stop + line up head shots
[1:41:53] <+rafaelba93> time stop basicaly make you are a god
[1:41:54] <Dreziv> I hope you get the Spirit Water bone charm
[1:41:54] <%Sir_Gawain_Lotsson> I HATE consumables
[1:41:56] <+IHATREID> @PatStaresAt what stops u from cheating and just making it infinite just so u can beat the game
[1:41:58] <%Mr_Pylon> we're on full smoke em if we gotem now
[1:41:59] <%Logoth_> What if I run out of this item I refuse to use
[1:42:03] <%A_Zealous_Retort> trying to ghost this I was ALWAYS out of mana potions
[1:42:05] <%GabeSweetMan> But what if you need 37 of them for the final boss?
[1:42:06] <cryomander61> Don't wanna run out of blinker fluid
[1:42:06] <RickyRelucent> prolly will require a big stealth
[1:42:07] <Coystick> Consume you fucks
[1:42:13] <RickyRelucent> if your gonna do the game withh zero pots
[1:42:17] <ElSuperNova> Get the mana refill by drinking water bone charm

[1:42:26] <%walternatorz> benedict?
[1:42:27] <Heyestus> luckily you can collect at least 9 in every map, meaning that it's  impossible to run out if you enter a map with some already @patstaresat
[1:42:28] <moonbearbacon> maybe force yourself to run out
[1:42:29] <Djinnazz> I love what you can do to these fucks
[1:42:30] <Coystick> I love dishonored faces
[1:42:30] <RickyRelucent> gonna have to space out and use ur abilities
[1:42:31] <%holydeviant1> If you don't use the powers to avoid running out of potions (and thus being denied the use of powers) then the result is the same as if you had run out of potions anyway!

[1:45:38] <jorniev> GOTTEM
[1:45:39] <%Sir_Gawain_Lotsson> It belongs to Goblin Diss
[1:45:39] <+pectusumbra> So the real question is does Corvo use the Heart as a sentient flesh light and if so, is she into it?
[1:45:41] <+IHATREID> id be pissed if some scary ghost nibba ripped my not wifes heart out and made it steampunk
[1:45:41] <CappuccinoGuil> I thought it was a reference to Cheogh?
[1:45:44] <+Dawndeather> Nah it's Hava's heart

[1:46:15] <cryomander61> Has Pat fought any of the slaw bunnies yet?
[1:46:15] <+Dawndeather> I like that the runes in 2 are bigger
[1:46:16] <%RayReborne> Very edgy, 8/20
[1:46:16] <s1rcuit> imagine being a normal cop and arresting this guy? a dude in a scary mechanical mask armed to the teeth with various weapons and a human heart with mechanical parts stuck in it
[1:46:17] <supergoblinpunch> Scrimshaw rune thing
[1:46:23] <DensityD> diggity hot

[1:52:06] <%RayReborne> SOKOLOV??? SHAGOHOD?!?!
[1:52:08] <+AutechreTwinAphex> Deathloop really feels like a Dishonored DLC that got turned into its own game afer seeing this
[1:52:09] <%JoshManVGH> Weird
[1:52:11] <Treasure_Vault> @ReallyBigRocks Jesus is the heart-shaped chest compartment of the holy trinity voltron.
[1:52:11] <+MackFighters> upgrades, upgrading, upgraded
[1:52:12] <xxshadowxx416> do it
[1:52:13] <akitanito> beeg money
[1:52:15] <%Sir_Gawain_Lotsson> it gives you the prompt to choke him
[1:52:17] <BurdRightsActivist> "Wow"
[1:52:19] <%ape_hawk> piero needs to get laid to fix his NPC-ness
[1:52:20] <DeadEyeArrow> Is piero the creepy one?
[1:52:23] <%addMoreCoffee> Corvo, where did you get the money?
[1:52:24] <CappuccinoGuil> capacity?
[1:52:25] <%GarbageNirvana> This guy's a lamer Otacon
[1:52:27] <%RealThiele> crossup++
[1:52:27] <DSD24> Sword Upgrades
[1:52:29] <Laecerelius> More charms?
[1:52:31] <+IHATREID> this guy reminds me of huey
[1:52:31] <ZE_Count> buy sleep darts
[1:52:33] <%GarbageNirvana> No wait
[1:52:34] <jorniev> bone charm
[1:52:36] <%GarbageNirvana> he's a lamer Huey
[1:52:46] <+RemedyofRevenge> Is otacon some kind of transformer or something?
[1:52:49] <%ThomasOfTroy> Key on table
[1:52:50] <%JoshManVGH> Pierro has the Outsiders eye, meanwhile he's being tsundre to Sokolov.
[1:52:59] <%GarbageNirvana> Which is hard to do because Huey's literally a paraplegic
[1:53:03] <Djinnazz> @GarbageNirvana no ones lamer than Huey
[1:53:03] <DSD24> Huey sucks too so imagine being lamer then him
[1:53:11] <PinkSocks> Don't think about it corvo
[1:53:16] <%SharkMissile> You super sometimes just gotta get a dude
[1:53:24] <MayorRev> hold up who voices this guy
[1:53:24] <CappuccinoGuil> Okay, but the non-lethal way to get rid of these next fucks is SO GOD DAMN GOOD
[1:53:25] <%ThomasOfTroy> There was a takeable item on that table I think
[1:53:27] <MayorRev> he sounds familiar
[1:53:28] <DSD24> Killing is the mark of a amateur however
[1:53:32] <Blu_C> It is worth mentioning that some of the non-kill resolutions are DARK. Like giving a lady to her stalker. ;.;
[1:53:32] <%RealThiele> in a world with literal rat plagues and whale magic, ok.
[1:53:35] <marvel877> Somebody needs some killin.
[1:53:36] <%ape_hawk> *corvo gets a list of every single billionaire*
[1:53:37] <Coystick> Look at his huge hands and little head
[1:53:38] <%SovPho> lol his hands
[1:53:44] <%SharkMissile> Your dong size is storied
[1:53:50] <ExpressNode> Sometimes you gotta make people stop breathing no biggie
[1:53:52] <%RealThiele> oh no i looked at his hands whyyy
[1:53:55] <DSD24> Pretty much
[1:54:01] <DSD24> He looks like Garret too
[1:54:01] <jkfd> dlc/preorder bonus items *always* ruin the game to some degree. sometimes really badly
[1:54:01] <%JoshManVGH> Corvo Solves Organized Religion
[1:54:09] <ohkayNiko> yeah, they even had him VOICED by GARRET in the sequel
[1:54:10] <%tank7013> Corvo your penis is huge. Massive even. We are in awe at the size of your penis
[1:54:10] <+RemedyofRevenge> Pat is playing as Kai "Corvo" Leng right now
[1:54:11] <superchunk121> He's cool but Garrets cooler
[1:54:13] <%Agami23> geralt?
[1:54:13] <%superc37> i mean he IS voiced by garrett in the second game
[1:54:13] <CappuccinoGuil> @Blu_C that's the only one I hate with a passion. And she's the ONLY character that hasn't directly slighted you. She's just a rich socialite.
[1:54:15] <+Chimeraelite> The thing is Garret is just a snarky bastard who only cares about money and his few connections
[1:54:16] <ElSuperNova> Garret had personality tho
[1:54:18] <%Mr_Pylon> Garrett without any personality
[1:54:21] <Coystick> Go kill the Hammerites, Corvett
[1:54:23] <tanarath> Garret talks
[1:54:27] <%RayReborne> Its pronounced Geralt Pat god Kappa
[1:54:27] <%Valdorick> Remember kids, if you're replaying a game, you already did your time. *Fucking cheat*
[1:54:36] <blue6sub6remnant6> Corvo "BigGeralt" McAssassin.
[1:54:41] <DSD24> Garret steals to pay rent
[1:54:45] <Mr_pwng3> shes got the rat face, its a plague
[1:54:46] <%Ziegsy> Butpat, this came out BEFORE the witcher 3
[1:54:48] <@Ranryu692> 2009 or whatever year it was
[1:54:51] <akitanito> fart goblins
[1:54:53] <%notsoy> did gief fart again
[1:54:54] <lloyddboy> UH OH
[1:54:56] <jtsoppy137> big stinky
[1:54:57] <%MidnightBurst12> strong dog aura
[1:55:00] <%RealThiele> shes made of plastic
[1:55:00] <MayorRev> NOXIOUS GAS DEPLOYED
[1:55:01] <intestinal_bleeding> stimky dog!?
[1:55:02] <%Dr_Mooose> gassy dog
[1:55:03] <%maskofmichael> dog goblins
[1:55:05] <Rionxgarland> mwahahah
[1:55:06] <%Profmcstevie> Dog is also upset by weird looking lady
[1:55:06] <%RayReborne> BIG POOP?!?!
[1:55:09] <%RealThiele> AT field activate
[1:55:11] <%sunsetdisc0> gief do a fart
[1:55:11] <Aiutare47> I will say they did a great job making the majority of the "non-lethal" resolutions much worse than just slitting their throats
[1:55:14] <Coystick> Dog's Super Saiyan Aura
[1:55:20] <CappuccinoGuil> Not really
[1:55:20] <Ozavic> God no
[1:55:22] <28moogles> Not really
[1:55:23] <Desthanos> I'
[1:55:23] <$Futurecity10> its easy if you knock everyone out
[1:55:23] <%SovPho> nah
[1:55:24] <lloyddboy> NO QUICKLOADING
[1:55:25] <some_brave_apollo> not really
[1:55:27] <xxshadowxx416> no
[1:55:28] <Laecerelius> Do it!  Save him with murder, Pat!
[1:55:29] <tanarath> No?
[1:55:30] <supergoblinpunch> No it's not
[1:55:30] <Desthanos> it's not really difficult
[1:55:31] <scrumbotime> DOGFIGHTING
[1:55:33] <ElSuperNova> hello miss secondary objective
[1:55:34] <+Eizack> Naw you can just knock him out and leave him in the rafters.
[1:55:34] <CappuccinoGuil> if you just kill Campbell first
[1:55:35] <+rafaelba93> not if you know what to do
[1:55:37] <blue6sub6remnant6> Dog fighting? That's terrible.
[1:55:37] <%GhoulishCripple> @cappuccinoguil would it be better or worse with the context of him technically taking good care of her despite being creepy?
[1:55:37] <DSD24> Couldn't you just knock him out
[1:55:38] <%WeLucklessJacks> Not really.
[1:55:39] <PinkSocks> eh you just knock him out
[1:55:39] <%SaiyanShoto> Pat why are you blaming your fart on the dog?
[1:55:44] <Coystick> Because goblins
[1:55:45] <$lotharrio> It's vaguely tricky... just gotta time it out right.
[1:55:45] <%RealThiele> mai waif
[1:55:46] <UnsteadyFunk> Thanks, Shivers.
[1:55:47] <%superc37> eh just pop him with a sleep dart and hide him in a dumpster
[1:55:49] <moonbearbacon> only hard because goblin
[1:55:50] <some_brave_apollo> even then its not too hard
[1:55:51] <%Chichen> its almost like things are easier without goblins
[1:55:51] <%SovPho> The only thing hard in this game is the weird interactions with guards in nokills
[1:55:55] <%RayReborne> nonlethal yeah
[1:56:00] <bippityjones> You can walk in the water, this isn't cold-loop
[1:56:01] <%Profmcstevie> Being a murderous asshole is REALLY smooth sailing
[1:56:01] <AllenDeadman> oh god this game
[1:56:05] <Laecerelius> Then shadow kill
[1:56:06] <%RayReborne> i TRIED SO DAMN HARD AND GAVE UP
[1:56:06] <Ozavic> There is a 'canon' way to ghost it, but you can also just knock the boy out
[1:56:09] <ZE_Count> blink is so good
[1:56:09] <%RealThiele> ghost deez nuts
[1:56:09] <Zebroneath> Blink 2 is just too strong to pass up
[1:56:10] <DSD24> Blink 2 High Voltage
[1:56:11] <jtsoppy137> super blink
[1:56:12] <Coystick> Kill them all Garett
[1:56:14] <%SovPho> tbh blink 2 and time slow are the only ones you need
[1:56:17] <ZE_Count> fear da fish
[1:56:19] <@Ranryu692> they might nip at your toes
[1:56:20] <bippityjones> yes and
[1:56:21] <%GhoulishCripple> sometimes
[1:56:22] <%drabberfaun535> "Play your way" Kappa
[1:56:23] <$lotharrio> They take a long time to find you.
[1:56:26] <+rafaelba93> yeah, they wont kill you
[1:56:26] <CappuccinoGuil> @GhoulishCripple doesn't matter, the principal of drugging a woman and giving her to a stalker who will put her in a position of powerlessness where he controls her fate is FUCKING HORRIBLE
[1:56:27] <%Profmcstevie> Challenge the fish
[1:56:28] <akitanito> betrayed
[1:56:29] <%A_Zealous_Retort> blink 182
[1:56:31] <Coystick> Awful British fish
[1:56:32] <%RealThiele> fafo
[1:56:37] <ZE_Count> fight the fish
[1:56:38] <muXPerience> Blink 2 but what about Brink 2? :(
[1:56:38] <AllenDeadman> eat them
[1:56:41] <s1rcuit> @PatStaresAt so what's the game plan, do you plan on going non-lethal when possible or do you not care?
[1:56:43] <moonbearbacon> this game is pretty I wish the field of view was a bit better
[1:56:45] <%BlackStarAura> Lol mean fish
[1:56:46] <ExpressNode> Oh sweet this game is $10 on the psn
[1:56:46] <%RayReborne> ONE FISH LUL
[1:56:48] <+NerevaRising> Damn! its been a while since I gazed at that Unreal Engine 3
[1:56:49] <DeadEyeArrow> Man with knife and gun, scared of fish.
[1:56:51] <Dreziv> Samuel DOES want to be your friend
[1:56:56] <DSD24> @CappuccinoGuil God I never could to that result its too horrible
[1:56:56] <%Profmcstevie> OI OI GIMME YER TOES SabaPing
[1:56:59] <Coystick> The marketing mask
[1:57:04] <jorniev> I LOVE THAT MASK
[1:57:06] <%Agami23> the dishonored mask looks pretty rad though, not gonna lie
[1:57:07] <ZE_Count> it was the man in the mask!
[1:57:10] <akitanito> but at least you look cool
[1:57:10] <%baka_sugoi> nice surfer VO
[1:57:11] <DSD24> Yeah but they don't know its you
[1:57:12] <%Mr_Pylon> Remind me, do they give a reason WHY Corvo can't show his face?
[1:57:19] <jtsoppy137> ghost runs must be canon i guess
[1:57:25] <%JoshManVGH> You know, the best preorder bonus I ever got to date came out of this game. It was a pack of French Tarot Playing Cards, an impossible thing to find in the states. Only found one other set in all of almost 10 years.
[1:57:26] <%RealThiele> hes wanted so he hides his face
[1:57:29] <CappuccinoGuil> @DSD24 and the other option is killing her. Yeah, this is.... a game of that era
[1:57:32] <%GhoulishCripple> @cappuccinoguil I mean fair, but also you literally kill the chick otherwise and she did actively help set up the Coup
[1:57:32] <%SovPho> I think the other assassins have the same mask? idk
[1:57:32] <%castlerock42> Corvo never changes his fucking clothes. The mask means nothing.
[1:57:34] <%ape_hawk> "hey this corvo guy escaped and a day later this masked dude came outta nowhere and starting murking everyone... oh well."
[1:57:36] <Coystick> That mask made an Imm Sim sell, think about that, that's how good that mask be.
[1:57:39] <DSD24> @Mr_Pylon I'd assume its to keep the heat off of him
[1:57:39] <%RayReborne> Robo man killed all the guards and turned them to dusy
[1:57:43] <%RayReborne> dust*
[1:57:49] <%crimsonharvest> dont say her name les you summon her
[1:57:51] <%RealThiele> dussy
[1:57:59] <@Ranryu692> it's a shame Susan Sarandon is a crazy asshole
[1:58:10] <%JoshManVGH> Is that who granny rags is?
[1:58:13] <ElSuperNova> TIme to fuck up that old eldritch grandma
[1:58:16] <some_brave_apollo> that's not very nice to say
[1:58:19] <jtsoppy137> LUL that deep breath
[1:58:21] <DSD24> @CappuccinoGuil I mean a lot of the non killing outcomes for most of the targets are often worst then just killing them. Though I think that was the point
[1:58:22] <%abelincoln_catpuncher> @ranryu692 how so???
[1:58:35] <@Ranryu692> @abelincoln_catpuncher big Jill Stein supporter
[1:58:46] <+rafaelba93> i like to disable mission markers
[1:58:52] <%A_Zealous_Retort> dont forget unconscious enemies can randomly die from hitting their head as they fall over
[1:58:58] <blue6sub6remnant6> @Ranryu692 Scientology crazy, anti-vax crazy, flat earth crazy, or other?
[1:58:59] <CappuccinoGuil> @GhoulishCripple She's the only target as far as I remember that you never interact with until that mission. She's a stranger to you (which I think was the point). It's just that the options... suck. Campbell at least you have beef with. You've met him. He taunts you.
[1:58:59] <%GhoulishCripple> @cappuccinoguil also 100% her low chaos fate is the EASIEST AND NICEST. fuckin the twins get their tongues cut out and enslaved, the Overseer gets Exiled, like Ignore the fire as he's burning exiled
[1:59:13] <%Agami23> in the water
[1:59:18] <Blu_C> There's an ocean RIGHT THERE pat.
[1:59:21] <%JoshManVGH> Son of a bitch! And Calissta is Lena Heady!? I never knew!
[1:59:21] <+Shockrates20XX> dumpster
[1:59:26] <+lucaflowe> just throw him in the water lol
[1:59:29] <Saltmeisterr> @PatStaresAt so what makes Dishonored an immersive sim? i don't really notice much system interactions compared to something like Prey.
[1:59:30] <akitanito> scare chord
[1:59:30] <jtsoppy137> monkaS
[1:59:31] <%RealThiele> you did it
[1:59:38] <Dunmarkh> fuck was that noise???
[1:59:38] <+NerevaRising> The sound of Goblins
[1:59:39] <%ape_hawk> PAT, THE ARROW
[1:59:40] <Laecerelius> Why did Piano go angry?!?!
[1:59:42] <%SharkMissile> Scare noise
[1:59:42] <%A_Zealous_Retort> the rats did
[1:59:49] <%ape_hawk> oh, nvm
[1:59:49] <Coystick> Jiiiiiiiiiii~
[1:59:50] <%RealThiele> keep moving goblin man
[1:59:51] <%NateyBeak> NO RELOAD. DRINK POTIONS
[1:59:51] <%GhoulishCripple> @cappuccinoguil she still is literally unharmed aside from knock out drugs. sure its skeevy but I'd RATHER be given to a stalker than Have my tongue cut out and forced to work to death in a mine
[1:59:53] <lloyddboy> WHO DARES PERCIEVE
[1:59:55] <ElSuperNova> Lol the games trying to fuck with you
[1:59:58] <LordDudeTheFirst> Must have been the fellas on the bridge
[1:59:59] <Korbeen> tripped on a piano
[2:00:02] <Gelphaze> It was the RATS!
[2:00:03] <%A_Zealous_Retort> the rats saw what you did
[2:00:12] <%RayReborne> on the bridge for a milisecond i think?
[2:00:23] <@Ranryu692> I think the guys one the bridge can see you for a moment, iirc
[2:00:23] <ohkayNiko> bruh is that sunny smiles voice actress??
[2:00:29] <Korbeen> steal from the woman
[2:00:31] <ElSuperNova> Arkane and their audio stings bah gawd

[2:00:34] <%Profmcstevie> The Black Plague WAS rough

[2:01:15] <ZeeJiggle> Good thing ya got a freak-ass mask, nobody will suspect you now
[2:01:15] <@Moobot> Hey folks, just a reminder! If you have Twitch connected to Discord, you can access the PSA Sub-Discord. Go to your User Settings, go to Connections, and click 'Join' on the PSA server under the Twitch connection.
[2:01:17] <akitanito> really?
[2:01:19] <CappuccinoGuil> @DSD24 My main issue is not that the non-lethals are worse than killing. I like that they are. I dislike her specific one because it feels really yucky that the game tells you to give a random woman to a stalker.
[2:01:28] <%RealThiele> someone make these guys a corpse chute
[2:01:42] <%SovPho> Wait is double jump a thing yet?
[2:01:43] <%JoshManVGH> Good catch
[2:01:46] <%GhoulishCripple> @cappuccinoguil BUT she's not random. she helped fund the coup directly.
[2:01:48] <@Ranryu692> it was the top one
[2:01:49] <Desthanos> That wanted poster changes if you've only ghosted up until the point you see it, it'll just be a wanted poster with a question mark on it.
[2:01:54] <+Tucker0603> my favorite hard stealth games have to be the Styx games, you'd think pat would like a stealth game where you play as an actual goblin
[2:02:21] <+MackFighters> Gwen Stefani
[2:02:22] <@Ranryu692> I thought Gwen was with Peter?
[2:02:29] <%JoshManVGH> Daww
[2:02:33] <some_brave_apollo> i bet they're a real couple that has long since broken up
[2:02:39] <CappuccinoGuil> @GhoulishCripple She literally is a random character to the player. She's the only target you have never met before. There's a reason why they have a whole setup before the empress dying. They want the player to take it personally.
[2:02:39] <+wizard_of_diamonds> And Lady Boyle's non-lethal fate is no less gruesome than the twins'
[2:02:41] <Laecerelius> I thought gwen was with the Green Goblin
[2:02:45] <akitanito> yep
[2:02:45] <$vehementvadr> not anymore
[2:02:53] <DSD24> @CappuccinoGuil Yeah its real rough its why I never did that option. Plus doesn't the lady in Question change on different play throughs? like its not the same sister?
[2:03:00] <%voidthieff> voidthieff subscribed at Tier 1. They've subscribed for 35 months! we really out here
[2:03:01] <jtsoppy137> ew
[2:03:01] <@Ranryu692> that lady just stomped a rat
[2:03:02] <%RayReborne> NINJA YEAH
[2:03:07] <%CzeekyTV> CzeekyTV subscribed at Tier 1. They've subscribed for 16 months! curb stomp those rats pat
[2:03:12] <@Ranryu692> yeah
[2:03:16] <+RyTYoung> OI
[2:03:17] <+RemedyofRevenge> has there ever been a good game about being part of a bikie gang? I can only think of bad ones
[2:03:17] <+MushyCornbread> Now Pat is unstoppable
[2:03:17] <PinkSocks> on the streets yeah
[2:03:18] <%afronooch> its you
[2:03:19] <DSD24> Oh we talking about Civie now?
[2:03:20] <Laecerelius> They're not gonna fuck with a man with a big sword and a creepy mask
[2:03:20] <jtsoppy137> hey pat
[2:03:22] <lloyddboy> pat in a hat
[2:03:22] <%superc37> yeah they dont care
[2:03:22] <+the_drummaestro> yup
[2:03:23] <Korbeen> u guys ever full ass stomp on a rat?
[2:03:23] <+NerevaRising> buff pat
[2:03:25] <@Ranryu692> so long as they don't see you do A Crime(tm)
[2:03:26] <+wizard_of_diamonds> @PatStaresAt Yeah, I don't think they even effect Ghost playthroughs
[2:03:28] <ElSuperNova> ya this a clear area
[2:03:30] <+Deekman> why do some bad guys have powers?
[2:03:31] <Dunmarkh> @Ranryu692 haven't we all?
[2:03:37] <+allups> if he is busy he myi
[2:03:37] <%GhoulishCripple> @cappuccinoguil I mean more so you never meet her before so they can have her gimmick of having sisters she's hidden amongst. she's just as culpable as the other targets for the coup.
[2:03:39] <TheFramedWarlock> Civvies are chill unless you're high chaos
[2:03:40] <UnsteadyFunk> Geezer's doin' his nut
[2:03:43] <%JoshManVGH> Yeah who cares what regular people think. its the cops who sre sus
[2:03:43] <BlockingDisabled> That dude looks like a pro wrestler
[2:03:58] <%RealThiele> totally use it for rat burning
[2:04:01] <@Ranryu692> @Ranryu692 where I'm from, the rats stomp back
[2:04:07] <%GhoulishCripple> @cappuccinoguil like if they didn't have the "which color is she" gimmick 100% you'd have met her earlier in the story
[2:04:07] <%JoshManVGH> Make them safe... for you!
[2:04:09] <%lemon_rinds> All those r  a  t  s
[2:04:11] <DSD24> Crispy
[2:04:12] <+RyTYoung> The spring razor traps are fucking brutal
[2:04:14] <+wizard_of_diamonds> "I ee" LUL
[2:04:18] <%rdark_ksu> man I hated those walls of light things
[2:04:20] <%Agami23> throw a body in there
[2:04:21] <%RealThiele> hell yeah
[2:04:28] <+allups> if an npc is busy they might do something context-sensitive
[2:04:30] <%GabeSweetMan> ????
[2:04:32] <Saltmeisterr> crisped rat
[2:04:33] <+wizard_of_diamonds> Fucking hell Pat you were so exposed WutFace
[2:04:33] <%lemon_rinds> They prey at night, they stalk at night
[2:04:34] <CappuccinoGuil> @GhoulishCripple I'm not saying she's not part of the coup, bud. I'm saying she is not someone you met, there's no personal beef to the player. She might as well be a rando off the street.
[2:04:34] <theshillman> pat u ok?
[2:04:36] <jerobees> Oh no the rats ;=;
[2:04:37] <%RealThiele> #blind
[2:04:40] <%NateyBeak> this games killing him i love it
[2:04:49] <akitanito> yep
[2:04:50] <%castlerock42> Guard school must be real easy.
[2:04:50] <AvroEltz> Look at this immersed goblin
[2:04:52] <$lotharrio> Under things or on top of them, Pat.
[2:05:01] <%GabeSweetMan> What Pat having a "Not Responding" moment there?
[2:05:02] <%JoshManVGH> What I hate about the walls of light is that the break the notion that Blink has you passing through some interstitial space.
[2:05:08] <DSD24> Cutter vs Blacky
[2:05:08] <%Sir_Gawain_Lotsson> astonishing that you can't just teleport through it
[2:05:11] <%Sir_Gawain_Lotsson> wait DAUD?!
[2:05:15] <CappuccinoGuil> What's your bounty?
[2:05:16] <+TheUltrahumanoid> Put him on the roof it‚Äôs funny
[2:05:18] <+wizard_of_diamonds> "Are you a DEAD COUNTER? We need BRAVE MEN to count BODIES!" LUL
[2:05:20] <Coystick> Love Viktor Antonov's  black metal-technology aesthetic
[2:05:20] <%GhoulishCripple> @cappuccinoguil and I'm saying you are WRONG. I had beef with her because she paid for the coup that killed my empress.
[2:05:20] <%Sir_Gawain_Lotsson> wow
[2:05:23] <%ape_hawk> daud is so cool, i hope they dont ruin him in future games
[2:05:24] <%JoshManVGH> Corvor is LITERALLY  just moving really fast.
[2:05:28] <@Spydurman> Pat you missed a single coin somewhere Kappa
[2:05:39] <+RyTYoung> except he killed the empress, which is not cool Kappa
[2:05:48] <jtsoppy137> Kappa
[2:05:54] <%GhoulishCripple> @cappuccinoguil and again regardless of her status of "random" or not her non lethal is the most merciful in the SERIES
[2:05:56] <+Deekman> @PatStaresAt how far did you make it in deathloop?
[2:06:01] <+wizard_of_diamonds> Time for cool old lady
[2:06:03] <WzillNJ> i think blink isn't actually teleportation, he's just moving forward really fast
[2:06:04] <+nial_evol> rewatching how huge Dishonored is makes me realize how much smaller deathloop ended up being.
[2:06:10] <+Deekman> oh, nice!
[2:06:11] <%JoshManVGH> She's got runes for deeds
[2:06:16] <+RyTYoung> Granny Rags is a riot
[2:06:17] <%GhoulishCripple> skeevy nature or not she's literally canonically unharmed
[2:06:23] <DSD24> So is Blink like Weskers Dash?
[2:06:23] <%NateyBeak> I like when corvo does a teleport and he whispers "soda"
[2:06:32] <+MackFighters> guy sees a man with a mask teleporting with a sword in his hand: "Innocent Whistling"
[2:06:34] <%DashXero> Have the goblins lost yet?
[2:06:35] <%JoshManVGH> Did you break the loop or stay in it?
[2:06:38] <+RAWPowerStudios> How do you prefer this or Dishonored 2? I'm trying to pick.
[2:06:38] <%Dova573> You think they gonna add shit to deathloop?
[2:06:42] <ElSuperNova> Mans pulling a ceaser
[2:06:47] <%RayReborne> you reminded me pat, all I gotta do is the pefect run and see whats left
[2:06:53] <jtsoppy137> feels bad man
[2:06:54] <+RyTYoung> I think they'll release dlc for Deathloop at some point
[2:06:58] <FameOH> you going for a no kill run?
[2:07:00] <%Dova573> Because I feelt like there was room for more deathloop content
[2:07:02] <DSD24> The story in Dishonored 1 is better than 2's
[2:07:16] <+wizard_of_diamonds> I can't recall ever doing a no-powers run, but I think that was due to it being too frustrating, despite the cool way you can no-powers escape the prisons
[2:07:19] <%GhoulishCripple> Dishonored 1 is the best In the series
[2:07:23] <LordOfThePoultry> yeyeyeyeye
[2:07:24] <%SharkMissile> BRING OUT YER DEAD
[2:07:24] <%ape_hawk> "pacifism ruined my life"
[2:07:25] <akitanito> welp
[2:07:26] <%SharkMissile> *DING*
[2:07:26] <jtsoppy137> LUL
[2:07:27] <%JoshManVGH> @dsd24 Blink is worse than weskers dash because Corvo only moves very fast
[2:07:27] <%Profmcstevie> Kill as we see fit run
[2:07:28] <%DashXero> So, the goblins have lost? Good for you, Pat.
[2:07:29] <%rdark_ksu> You may kill a few people. As a treat
[2:07:29] <Laecerelius> Pat must go for an all kill run.  Kill everyone, especially the children
[2:07:29] <DSD24> Nice broken legs
[2:07:30] <Coystick> HIGH CHAOS
[2:07:31] <+wizard_of_diamonds> FIGHT IT
[2:07:31] <%GabeSweetMan> Yes and there there's Dishonored.

[2:07:33] <CanadianAnimatorGuy> LUL

[2:07:34] <+wizard_of_diamonds> FIGHT IT PAT
[2:07:35] <+RyTYoung> @dsd24 yeah, but the levels in Dishonored 2 are better than 1

[2:18:05] <%razielhex> I'm guessing that old YTMND of Jim Carrey in "Me, Myself, and Irene" with Julia Roberts face superimposed on him, mouth agape and shouting buried deep in @PatStaresAt 's mind and is subconsciously driving his perception.

[2:20:56] <%Sir_Gawain_Lotsson> that was her
[2:20:56] <tj_timbs> you have to deliberately place unconscious people in places you don't think there'll be rats
[2:20:57] <+Deekman> @PatStaresAt will death by street rats count towards your chaos?
[2:20:57] <%DashXero> The whiskey zone sounds like my old professor's name for the teachers' lounge.
[2:20:59] <Gelphaze> YUUMMY!
[2:21:00] <%Valdorick> Correct
[2:21:01] <MKII> looks like a death by natural causes to me

[2:21:04] <jtsoppy137> Yes Kappa
[2:21:05] <%Chichen> yeah, they cant swim so they eat people
[2:21:05] <@Ranryu692> it's why they haven't caught me yet
[2:21:06] <Laecerelius> Ask Vinny Pizzapasta
[2:21:06] <@Ranryu692> I mean

[2:21:31] <Laecerelius> Vinny "Sauce Boss" Pizzapasta
[2:21:41] <%cobalt_phoenix_> @cheapdoc bc you're supposed to prevent it by putting the bodies in safe spots
[2:21:44] <%GarbageNirvana> Vincent P. Pasta
[2:21:46] <Dreziv> @cheapdoc hide your bodies
[2:21:47] <CappuccinoGuil> @cheapdoc it's only if you leave them around rats they'll die eventually.
[2:21:48] <DSD24> @cheapdoc Because if there's more dead bodies everywhere that means more plague rats are gonna be present
[2:21:57] <%SinnerEbru> a NYC rat could site across you at a restaurant and only some people would stop and look

[2:26:20] <%Profmcstevie> Rats can't use ladders or blink haha
[2:26:21] <%walternatorz> they climb through water

[2:28:38] <+pupil31> LUL
[2:28:41] <%alcors_wisdom> does pat want hot tips or does he want it blind
[2:28:41] <%TravisSchnee> @RemedyofRevenge Does that mean he's gonna stab the bad guys

[2:29:03] <huskarl_zap> hot tip run into the electric walls
[2:29:04] <Zombrocom> Man, I really need to play prey
[2:29:04] <Heyestus> gotta get to childish gambino's office
[2:29:04] <%KnifeyMcEdge> i bet
[2:29:08] <+ReallyBigRocks> I only give weak and/or lame tips
[2:29:10] <%GarbageNirvana> Wasn't Prey made by the same devs as this
[2:29:15] <cheerfulnpc> @remedyofrevenge *mind's real run
[2:29:15] <Coystick> A zapping system
[2:29:20] <+Eizack> I swear it has a tagging system.
[2:29:22] <+Deekman> Like Jet Set Radio?! Hell yeah!
[2:29:24] <lethallylactic> LUL
[2:29:24] <Dunmarkh> @GarbageNirvana yes.
[2:29:24] <PinkSocks> DotO had that
[2:29:26] <David_de_Bergerac> i just wanted to tell you both: Good luck. We're all counting on you.
[2:29:28] <+RemedyofRevenge> @TravisSchnee it means that he will try to play as best he can, and live with his mistakes despite his crippling mind goblins begging him to reload a save
[2:29:28] <%bevyrage> prey and death loop
[2:29:28] <%superc37> dishonored 2 has smothing like that if you play as emily
[2:29:32] <%Profmcstevie> Tagging sucks, use your eyes
[2:29:34] <Zombrocom> Oh shit he looked up
[2:29:34] <%Monkeyweed21> @PatStaresAt you can just use dark vision
[2:29:34] <%RayReborne> Hot Tip: People die when they are killed Kappa
[2:29:34] <+Dawndeather> IF that's the case then I'd also recommend getting Agility from your skills. The first level of it lets you double jump
[2:29:37] <KaitlynnHere> I also don‚Äôt mind a hot tip, but just the tip
[2:29:43] <T_Sasquatch> Far cry tagging system made it brainless
[2:29:44] <%RealThiele> K I LL
[2:29:46] <%BoxNavy> owned
[2:29:47] <tj_timbs> there's a tagging system associated with a power in the second game i believe
[2:29:49] <%GarbageNirvana> Also can't you air assassinate
[2:29:55] <Zombrocom> God I love blink
[2:30:05] <David_de_Bergerac> is this the anti-goblin playthrough?
[2:30:06] <cheerfulnpc> @remedyofrevenge I tried to say mind-break but autocorrect is a fuck
[2:30:14] <theshillman> if only you had dark vision
[2:30:18] <%RealThiele> @David_de_Bergerac yep
[2:30:22] <akitanito> I thought I heard a dentist drill
[2:30:23] <jtsoppy137> big drink of air on that one
[2:30:26] <David_de_Bergerac> mind break is a booru tag
[2:30:29] <classical_gomez> Hot Tip: Killing every 3rd person I think still gets you the good ending. My friend got pissed I fell ass first into every room and still did better than him
[2:30:31] <+wizard_of_diamonds> Butthole pucker factor is at maximum
[2:30:36] <%Dante_Magnum> 'ted did you hear those shadows say 'you didn't see shit!' just now?'
[2:30:39] <David_de_Bergerac> @realthiele thank ye
[2:30:48] <Coystick> I like that you can disable pretty much every HUD element piece by piece if you want to, like who actually needs a crouch icon in the corner, you should know you're crouched because you crouched.
[2:31:02] <David_de_Bergerac> kick his ass, seabass
[2:31:03] <%GarbageNirvana> Throw him into the zappy fence!

[2:31:43] <@Ranryu692> I love Corvo's sword
[2:31:45] <%RealThiele> nice background
[2:31:48] <David_de_Bergerac> AceAssin'
[2:31:49] <%JoshManVGH> Under hand means murder time!
[2:31:50] <BubbaGAN0USH> Cool Ass Ass in
[2:31:51] <KaitlynnHere> Acesassin
[2:31:51] <MidnightPacif1c> s word
[2:31:52] <+SataruYamate> the sword we will never use to harm
[2:31:53] <theshillman> less than five feet apart üò≥
[2:31:53] <ShinyVagikarp> SeemsGood
[2:31:57] <%GarbageNirvana> Can't you actually break the fence by throwing enough dudes into it here
[2:32:01] <SaltyAzteca> Suward
[2:32:01] <i_chevalier> @coystick they're just roommates lol
[2:32:01] <%baka_sugoi> RAT ASS IN
[2:32:02] <+Deekman> Aysassin forge' abou'd it
[2:32:04] <@Ranryu692> also NG+
[2:32:06] <%A_Zealous_Retort> rat possession is mood
[2:32:16] <CappuccinoGuil> God, remember jumping off a window and possessing a fucking fish to escape?
[2:32:17] <Zombrocom> BECOME AS RAT
[2:32:20] <%alcors_wisdom> you need rat possession to get sick loot
[2:32:23] <Mr_pwng3> too short
[2:32:25] <%TravisSchnee> Keep thinking that noise is the halo theme
[2:32:26] <%JoshManVGH> Become as rat
[2:32:26] <CappuccinoGuil> LUL
[2:32:29] <DSD24> Wow he really says soda
[2:32:33] <@Ranryu692> you sat on the spiky part
[2:32:36] <marvel877> was doing family stuff, how has the fight with the goblins gone so far?
[2:32:38] <%JoshManVGH> Those are spiked
[2:32:39] <Zombrocom> Ya blinked onto the spikes
[2:32:40] <BubbaGAN0USH> pointy fences hurt
[2:32:41] <DSD24> I can't unhear it now
[2:32:41] <+RemedyofRevenge> there goes the fall damage-less ending Kappa
[2:32:42] <akitanito> big cool
[2:32:43] <SaltyAzteca> So cool
[2:32:48] <David_de_Bergerac> i would also hurt myself doing that
[2:32:48] <%RealThiele> like even with high chaos rat possesion corvo should be able to end the plague himself by running them all into a rat grinder or somethin
[2:32:51] <tj_timbs> cool :o
[2:32:52] <jorniev> remember agility gives you double jump
[2:32:57] <ElSuperNova> mans needs agility
[2:32:58] <@Ranryu692> @marvel877 well, though many internal anxieties are happening
[2:32:59] <CappuccinoGuil> @marvel877 He's sweating, but going through
[2:33:03] <%JoshManVGH> Yeyeyeye
[2:33:21] <%Monkeyweed21> should get agility next to get the super jump
[2:33:23] <KaitlynnHere> @patstaresat do you got that palm sweats?
[2:33:25] <David_de_Bergerac> sweet
[2:33:30] <akitanito> time to looot
[2:33:32] <tj_timbs> correct
[2:33:34] <%alcors_wisdom> seriously pat if you can afford it get rat possession
[2:33:36] <%alcors_wisdom> wait
[2:33:36] <%JoshManVGH> How many Mana potions does pat have?
[2:33:41] <Zombrocom> Super jump, rather
[2:33:41] <%JoshManVGH> It does
[2:33:43] <+rafaelba93> high jump
[2:33:44] <%alcors_wisdom> if you get possession you can get a rune here
[2:33:44] <+RemedyofRevenge> You know, this game has a style that looks a lot like a higher res first person Fable
[2:33:45] <AvroEltz> I really reccomend double jump
[2:33:48] <theshillman> 2860
[2:33:49] <%JoshManVGH> Level 2
[2:33:51] <DianaTheAscian> Hows Pat doing?
[2:33:53] <DSD24> Wait how does this double jump work exactly
[2:33:54] <i_chevalier> @patstaresat Can you get rid of the health UI, it really stands out to much.
[2:33:54] <tanarath> But Double Jump!
[2:34:05] <+rafaelba93> high jump is the best thing after blink IMO
[2:34:13] <jorniev> ugh
[2:34:19] <DSD24> Are you doing cool DMC shit or are you doing dumb GOW jumps where you just jump twice
[2:34:19] <%JoshManVGH> You should use your powers more wrecklessley.... @patstaresat
[2:34:25] <David_de_Bergerac> just now realizing I've never looked at this game at any length
[2:34:26] <AvroEltz> pat there is a cabinet on the side of the rat
[2:34:27] <%superc37> @PatStaresAt you can hold the button to collect all the coins in a pile btw
[2:34:37] <+chester804> i remember playing this trying to get Ghost level on each mission... that was not fun lol
[2:34:38] <Zombrocom> Neither, it's just a high jump
[2:34:57] <David_de_Bergerac> However both rats, notably, cannot swim
[2:34:59] <akitanito> I don't like how the subtitles disappear
[2:34:59] <jorniev> PLAGUEEEEE
[2:34:59] <%JoshManVGH> Chain blink and drink a potion, it will be good for you.
[2:35:10] <%RealThiele> whales possessed the rats to enact revengeeee
[2:35:13] <DrStinkers> Wuhan rats
[2:35:15] <Forbidden_Karp> Foreigners bringing plague!?
[2:35:17] <supergoblinpunch> Time for Brexit
[2:35:18] <%JoshManVGH> Hmmmmm mystery
[2:35:20] <DSD24> @Zombrocom Ok cool its been awhile so I didn't remember
[2:35:21] <KaitlynnHere> Oh no
[2:35:22] <Heyestus> they all came over from France like the end of A Plague Tale
[2:35:23] <%baka_sugoi> they STINKY
[2:35:24] <+DatAsuna> "it's da goddamn immigants"
[2:35:25] <%RayReborne> They like to bitch about things Kappa
[2:35:33] <+RemedyofRevenge> henlo stinky rat
[2:35:35] <bippityjones> Bastard Magic Rat
[2:35:38] <David_de_Bergerac> hello rat
[2:35:44] <jorniev> I think there is a code for a safe in the science room
[2:35:49] <David_de_Bergerac> aww
[2:35:50] <jorniev> or maybe the other
[2:35:52] <David_de_Bergerac> him stinky
[2:35:53] <i_chevalier> Fun Fact: The rats didn't spread the black plague as much as history says.
[2:35:53] <Zombrocom> I read "White Phosphorus" on that paper. Concerning.
[2:35:53] <DSD24> Take a shot everytime someone says "Rat"
[2:35:54] <tj_timbs> ratto not so dangerous when alone
[2:36:02] <%JoshManVGH> Oh man a cross over between this and A Plague's Tale would be stellar!
[2:36:05] <David_de_Bergerac> rat
[2:36:06] <%Deft_Thought> Good thing those fucks can't swim
[2:36:16] <T_Sasquatch> @i_chevalier ok rat apologist
[2:36:24] <David_de_Bergerac> would be real bad if rats could swim
[2:36:25] <+boomstarprime> how's goblin town going
[2:36:25] <%GarbageNirvana> So we gotta look for the giant rat that makes all of da rules
[2:36:28] <Zombrocom> Rat go squeak
[2:36:31] <%DashXero> Rats all over the shop.
[2:36:33] <bippityjones> Look through this keyhole to get mooned by a rat ( X )
[2:36:38] <%abelincoln_catpuncher> @i_chevalier people using diseased bodies as weapons to catapult into cities under siege definitely fucked it up
[2:36:40] <KaitlynnHere> Can‚Äôt rats swim? Isn‚Äôt that why they can hang out in sewers?
[2:36:44] <jorniev> there!
[2:36:50] <Heyestus> Read the chalkboard
[2:36:52] <jorniev> there was a code on the thing
[2:36:54] <%JoshManVGH> I think somones gonna fuck with a bookshelf
[2:36:55] <Zombrocom> Those were some sus numbers
[2:36:57] <%RayReborne> Number on chalk board
[2:36:58] <David_de_Bergerac> nah rats are naturally really bad swimmers
[2:36:58] <jtsoppy137> shits locked
[2:37:01] <ohkayNiko> Pat have u tried the Death of the Outsider sequel? It feels like what Dishonored should have been from the beginning. Far less mind goblin shit
[2:37:09] <%maskofmichael> Locked from the side
[2:37:09] <+spartanghost004> Hey pat have you heard of the chaos system? IT'S A SCENARIO SYSTEM
[2:37:13] <jorniev> 287

[2:44:04] <%JoshManVGH> HEAVE
[2:44:04] <+wizard_of_diamonds> The sight power is going to take a lot of anxiety out of the guesswork for stuff like this
[2:44:05] <scrumbotime> Cardiac Arrest is when Whammu puts handcuffs on your heart instead of an earring
[2:44:09] <akitanito> but you didn't get the coin
[2:44:11] <@Ranryu692> there was a coin under the key
[2:44:13] <%RayReborne> Stop with the "-Ussy" dammit

[2:44:34] <cheapdoc> @RayReborne Don't tell me to Stussy
[2:44:34] <scrumbotime> Oh god no.
[2:44:35] <+ItalianWaifu> You can tell a Pat is startled by his panicked squeak he releases to alert the others
[2:44:38] <KaitlynnHere> Oie!
[2:44:39] <%JoshManVGH> @komayeda Oooooh god no it is not
[2:44:42] <%A_Zealous_Retort> given the inability to clumb or swim and the willingness to eat living unconscious people I have concluded the plague rats are in actuality tiny hairy pigs
[2:44:45] <%walternatorz> mind goblin run
[2:44:46] <+JustToWatch> @PatStaresAt just think of it this way, nothing you say tonight will be worse than Whussy. Probably

[2:46:28] <%shurtal> Daud? You mean Shimano?
[2:46:34] <Laecerelius> Grenade for BIG MURDER
[2:46:44] <%JoshManVGH> Touched By An Outsider is a much better show than Touched By An Angel.
[2:46:46] <%alcors_wisdom> there are some pretty funny speedrun strats with grenades
[2:46:47] <%ape_hawk> i bet daud fucks whussies cuz they are the only ones that can take his big cock
[2:46:49] <+pectusumbra> and you can see your sound
[2:46:50] <%JoshManVGH> See Items
[2:46:50] <tj_timbs> you see where valuables are
[2:46:53] <PinkSocks> it's items and security shit
[2:46:54] <%cobalt_phoenix_> objects
[2:46:55] <Heyestus> wallhacks basically @patstaresat
[2:46:55] <akitanito> seems pretty good
[2:46:57] <@Ranryu692> objects, too
[2:46:58] <%SovPho> agility gives double jump right?
[2:46:59] <emper0rner0> It also shows you all items
[2:47:00] <%superc37> items and collectables
[2:47:01] <Desthanos> Dark Vision 2 also lets you see items of value
[2:47:02] <%NigelSchnauzerpug> I'm amazed he doesn't even have dark vision at all. I use to live in dark vision
[2:47:08] <David_de_Bergerac> it lets you be a cool guy
[2:47:09] <%JoshManVGH> Ans fields of vision but mostly see items
[2:47:12] <Komayeda> Pat, ya know ya don't have to stealth through here right?
[2:47:13] <%cobalt_phoenix_> level 1 is for people, level 2 shows consumables and other items
[2:47:14] <%superc37> like money an ammo
[2:47:17] <%bassoontyphoon> Daud‚Äôs badassery is what BioWare writers thought they were doing with Kai Leng
[2:47:23] <%SovPho> are there any black people in Dishonored
[2:47:23] <Forbidden_Karp> the Big Key
[2:47:38] <Admiral_PopnFresh> maybe people shouldn't eat the rats that are the source of the plague
[2:47:54] <%cobalt_phoenix_> @SovPho i think so
[2:47:59] <%king_wragles> @SovPho yes, and one of them is a PC protag!
[2:48:03] <%CalderGaming> @SovPho yep
[2:48:05] <MrBaldachin> @SovPho yes daud's buddy is actually
[2:48:05] <Komayeda> @SovPho Yeah, but they only become prominent in the DLC and 2
[2:48:13] <%NigelSchnauzerpug> @Admiral_PopnFresh If you eat tiny amounts at a time you build up an immunity to the plague.
[2:48:13] <Forbidden_Karp> @SovPho definitely in Dishonored 2, don't know the first
[2:48:15] <%SovPho> oh bet yeah in Dishonored 2
[2:48:15] <+coldsama> Dark Vision is so good it ruins the game, you speed your entire playthrough with it one once you unlock it, like detective vision in Batman games
[2:48:19] <%SovPho> totally forgot
[2:48:20] <David_de_Bergerac> FamilyMan
[2:48:25] <+coldsama> spend
[2:48:32] <emper0rner0> Sometimes you can only go in through one door
[2:48:32] <%RealThiele> murder your way in
[2:48:41] <David_de_Bergerac> You should play that old Thief game with the funny combat
[2:48:47] <Admiral_PopnFresh> @NigelSchnauzerpug no1SUS
[2:48:57] <SaltyAzteca> :(
[2:48:58] <Komayeda> So Pat, you know that they won't attack you, right?
[2:48:58] <%MidnightBurst12> D: rude
[2:48:58] <jtsoppy137> also the sword combat is.... not good
[2:49:04] <%GarbageNirvana> nah just a couple of dudes into the fence it'll be fine
[2:49:07] <%maskofmichael> Sneaky, but murder is okay
[2:49:08] <i_chevalier> Why does the game cause mind goblins again?
[2:49:11] <Desthanos> The guards in this game are such dicks to each other it's actually comical.
[2:49:13] <lloyddboy> LUL
[2:49:15] <jtsoppy137> NICE

[2:49:28] <%cobalt_phoenix_> @coldsama i think any game that highlights people and such shouldn't affect the rest of the world, it absolutely ruins the aesthetic of the game

[2:49:29] <valstriam> LUL

[2:50:28] <DeadEyeArrow> master key is like a top 5 key to have
[2:51:00] <Admiral_PopnFresh> @JoshManVGH you are asking him to use a lot of consumables
[2:51:05] <%A_Zealous_Retort> would pat have issues with limited use per day spells in DnD?
[2:51:06] <%NigelSchnauzerpug> My favorite part is when overseers start walking around with oversized music boxes.
[2:51:11] <%bassoontyphoon> @patstaresat I‚Äôve had the game crash on me a few times before, so even if you won‚Äôt quick load dropping saves from time to time may be a good idea

[2:52:50] <tanarath> WE LOST HIM
[2:52:56] <GilliamYaeger> THIS ACTUALLY WORKS
[2:52:57] <Admiral_PopnFresh> GUN

[2:52:59] <GilliamYaeger> lol
[2:53:02] <akitanito> you have a grenade
[2:53:03] <%RealThiele> yeyeye its time
[2:53:04] <%RayReborne> chains to climb Kappa
[2:53:05] <%CalderGaming> i mean that would have disabled the tripwire quietly in OTHER games,
[2:53:05] <LordOfThePoultry> MURDER
[2:53:12] <lloyddboy> F
[2:53:14] <Forbidden_Karp> probably for hte best
[2:53:14] <@Ranryu692> good thing you saved LUL
[2:53:15] <%SovPho> I'm gonna MAKE CHAOS
[2:53:15] <jtsoppy137> f
[2:53:15] <poisin224> F
[2:53:17] <%superc37> nice one
[2:53:17] <%MidnightBurst12> fire bad
[2:53:18] <%baka_sugoi> parry fire LUL
[2:53:23] <%JoshManVGH> Oof
[2:53:24] <akitanito> that's some powerful alcohol fire
[2:53:24] <GilliamYaeger> F
[2:53:25] <Desthanos> You can't block fire pat, everyone knows that
[2:53:26] <DaCheekyOne> pat dies on purpose
[2:53:27] <$lotharrio> Derd
[2:53:27] <Heyestus> @patstaresat remember that you can climb chains
[2:53:30] <+RemedyofRevenge> defeated by the mind gussy
[2:53:32] <%RayReborne> There are chains you can climb lol
[2:53:33] <%GuilKato> CHAOS? I love Chaos!
[2:53:34] <ElSuperNova> Its good to die!
[2:53:37] <ZeeJiggle> That is a fair incorrect assumption
[2:53:42] <@Ranryu692> yeah, trigger means set off
[2:53:42] <TurtlesAndTentacles> Im surprised pat is playing this
[2:53:43] <%bassoontyphoon> Remember the basics of cqc
[2:53:44] <XoftheTITANS> no kill run is a go
[2:53:51] <%JoshManVGH> Yeah disarm is dumb in this game
[2:53:51] <%RoldanDgr8> it was a shotgun
[2:53:52] <CanadianAnimatorGuy> I remember this room. I tried to shoot the guy in the head and it passed through his goddamn neck
[2:53:53] <+pectusumbra> a disable yeah, I'd assume that too
[2:53:58] <KaitlynnHere> That‚Äôs what she said
[2:54:04] <Kaji04> it said trigger no disarm lol
[2:54:05] <%RealThiele> trigger vs disable
[2:54:06] <MrBaldachin> just Become Rat
[2:54:07] <akitanito> I thought you're poisoning the still, not breaking it
[2:54:08] <%SharkMissile> That's a terrible song
[2:54:14] <%bassoontyphoon> It‚Äôs not disable though it literally says ‚Äútrigger‚Äù
[2:54:19] <lloyddboy> MUMMY
[2:54:19] <%JoshManVGH> You have to disarm the launcher and not the trip wire, because fuck it apparently
[2:54:19] <emper0rner0> You have to disarm the actual gun that's firing instead of the wire that triggers it
[2:54:19] <@Ranryu692> @XoftheTITANS nah, he's killed people. it's just a low chaos run, not pacifist
[2:54:21] <+pectusumbra> that's a limerick
[2:54:41] <+pectusumbra> outside, grab it on the way out
[2:54:48] <%JoshManVGH> You can also blink while holding chains
[2:55:06] <%JoshManVGH> Doing it!
[2:55:19] <$lotharrio> Blame it on the rats.
[2:55:23] <%JoshManVGH> Must have
[2:55:26] <Blu_C> Tony Luzudo?
[2:55:26] <%alcors_wisdom> is this the room with the climbing puzzle or is that a later level
[2:55:26] <ZeeJiggle> Those god damn rats, drinking my booze.
[2:55:26] <Forbidden_Karp> tbf rats are a problem
[2:55:29] <Vivirmos> Musta been the wind

[2:55:56] <%NigelSchnauzerpug> @PatStaresAt You should kill more Pat. You should kill everyone.

[2:56:48] <Desthanos> Are we just gonna forget about the bone charm Pat?
[2:56:49] <%JoshManVGH> But the book on the table will try to instill guilt
[2:56:53] <%RayReborne> bone charm?

[2:57:33] <%Ne1son> psaGoblin Pat the Charm PAt psaGoblin
[2:57:35] <+aWanderingKaivo> wait why is Pat dishonoreding
[2:57:36] <Forbidden_Karp> why do we want to contaminate the still?
[2:57:40] <%JoshManVGH> @alcors_wisdom Not on this pass, but the next
[2:57:41] <@Ranryu692> you did indeed
[2:57:41] <Foopoof> Bern cherm
[2:57:41] <%GuilKato> yes
[2:57:42] <%RealThiele> ignore charm
[2:57:48] <@Ranryu692> and the locked room in the Doctor's house
[2:57:48] <Desthanos> How could you pat. that man was just trying to take a piss and you knocked him out.
[2:57:51] <Laecerelius> Granny will give charm
[2:57:54] <%JoshManVGH> There is a charm though
[2:58:13] <%JoshManVGH> This one is in a weirdo place
[2:58:20] <%JoshManVGH> Blink
[2:58:25] <%Logoth_> Whose footprints are these
[2:58:26] <%alcors_wisdom> dart pat
[2:58:36] <+Deekman> play pink panther
[2:58:41] <%JoshManVGH> So someone threw that up there, right?
[2:58:54] <jtsoppy137> gun ammo or both?
[2:58:54] <%chiazam> Has Pat gotten to his first target yet?
[2:59:14] <$lotharrio> He's working towards it, chiazam
[2:59:16] <%JoshManVGH> On his way
[2:59:18] <%RayReborne> wrong one equipped
[2:59:31] <%alcors_wisdom> i feel like there was one in the doctors' house too but i cant remember clearly its been a year or two since my last play thorugh
[2:59:38] <%Ne1son> Wrong charm PAt
[3:00:13] <%JoshManVGH> @alcors_wisdom That is also second pass!
[3:00:20] <%RayReborne> Smarter than Bopha
[3:00:35] <%JoshManVGH> This pass is mostly Granny rags, and that one just in a booth
[3:00:40] <%Fooguwu> has pat noticed the line at the bottom yet?
[3:00:42] <%CalderGaming> it feels good until someone clips thru the world and gives you a kill on a no-kill run, which obv isn't a problem for pat. but
[3:00:51] <%SveriSageAdvice> @RayReborne someone already tried that one lol
[3:00:59] <%alcors_wisdom> you say also but the first one was here @JoshManVGH i mean i believe you since i cant remember but im just saying
[3:01:08] <%DashXero> Well, the plague will soon be upon them.
[3:01:23] <%Ziegsy> granny rags is paige in 5 years. not in any meaningfull way, we just will call her that
[3:01:24] <DaCheekyOne> pat's doing well to avoid the mindgoblins so far
[3:01:24] <@Moobot> Hey folks, just a reminder! If you have Twitch connected to Discord, you can access the PSA Sub-Discord. Go to your User Settings, go to Connections, and click 'Join' on the PSA server under the Twitch connection.
[3:01:29] <%RayReborne> i forgot if it was spelled differently or not lol @sverisageadvice
[3:01:32] <%GiantRatThatMakesTheRulz> GiantRatThatMakesTheRulz subscribed with Prime. They've subscribed for 12 months! It's been a while but I'm back! I recently got back from a very fun and covid safe cruise to Europe with my family. And this time I did not accidentally shame my mother by wearing a heavy metal shirt to the Vatican, unlike the last time!
[3:01:37] <+Dawndeather> All I want is a single Ara ara from Susan Sarandon
[3:01:38] <%JoshManVGH> @alcors_wisdom Oh, I'm talking Runes, not charms, sorry.
[3:01:45] <%RoldanDgr8> dark vision?
[3:01:48] <lloyddboy> GOTTA GO FAST
[3:01:49] <$lotharrio> Agility is passive
[3:01:50] <tanarath> VISION!
[3:01:50] <%alcors_wisdom> bend time is really good later
[3:01:51] <DSD24> Do some Time shit
[3:01:54] <IronGlorfindel> Shadow Keel
[3:01:55] <%JoshManVGH> Shadow Kill!
[3:01:57] <+Dawndeather> Yes
[3:01:57] <DeadEyeArrow> Never get dark vision
[3:02:00] <Desthanos> I'd imagine it would
[3:02:07] <Aiutare47> Yes
[3:02:07] <%Eaglestrike117> yup
[3:02:08] <+rafaelba93> agility is qol
[3:02:09] <Heyestus> if you're  choking dudes out atm there's  no point for shadow kill
[3:02:10] <+Dawndeather> It makes you crouch faster
[3:02:13] <ElSuperNova> Might be a bone charm
[3:02:14] <%RayReborne> All movement so probably
[3:02:20] <MrBaldachin> it says "Overall"
[3:02:26] <%JoshManVGH> there is also a charm for it later
[3:02:28] <ZeeJiggle> So hold jump. Yeah it's weird.
[3:02:35] <%JoshManVGH> Nice!
[3:02:39] <DeadEyeArrow> I went mostly stealth and never used vision
[3:02:40] <%Profmcstevie> That is a SIGNIFICANT jump
[3:02:42] <ZeeJiggle> useful tho
[3:02:43] <SociallyAwkwardToaster> you get used to it
[3:02:43] <Heyestus> feels good tho, right?
[3:02:45] <+Dawndeather> It's really good though
[3:02:46] <%Dakuu75> hold? that's bizarre
[3:02:48] <+rafaelba93> it works great tho
[3:02:48] <+Deekman> it's like the outer wilds
[3:02:49] <Coystick> looks a little fucky
[3:02:51] <+aWanderingKaivo> it looks weird I imagine its even weirder using it yourself
[3:02:54] <Zombrocom> Got the hops
[3:02:54] <%notsoy> double jumps are rad
[3:02:55] <+pectusumbra> and you can combo that with blink right?
[3:02:59] <+snurtlord> u get some hops on that
[3:03:00] <+Emperor_Z> I have the dumbest reason for not being able to get into Dishonored. I don't like the writing style of the notes and other fluff
[3:03:03] <%JoshManVGH> Boost Jump and Long Blink for maximum reach
[3:03:12] <Vivirmos> It's very clear the height though, no 'did i let go too early' there
[3:03:12] <%alcors_wisdom> i think theres a safe in the black market guy's house but you cant get to it till much later
[3:03:15] <Desthanos> @pectusumbra yes you can if your fast enough
[3:03:17] <jetstreamlove_R> help not to accidentally tap twice on jump
[3:03:19] <%DashXero> The rats are hungry!
[3:03:19] <+rafaelba93> combine high jump with blink for maximus ninja shit
[3:03:23] <Zombrocom> THE RATS
[3:03:26] <%Sir_Gawain_Lotsson> crikRage
[3:03:26] <Onamar> You can skip a ton of a certain level in the middle of the game with just one long teleport + high jump
[3:03:29] <%robotoken> Pasta rats
[3:03:33] <%Fooguwu> jump + blink at the apex is hot
[3:03:33] <jtsoppy137> DA RATS
[3:03:36] <RushUnplugged> rats can't swim but they sure can swarm!
[3:03:41] <%Sir_Gawain_Lotsson> crikRage SKREEE crikRage GET MAN-THING
[3:03:42] <zeekayart> hiiiiiiiiiiii
[3:03:44] <%JoshManVGH> Rat Friends!
[3:03:45] <Coystick> Rat gang looming
[3:03:47] <Zombrocom> Ah yeah, that's the RAT theme
[3:03:48] <Heyestus> hired goons
[3:03:49] <MidnightPacif1c> coxWiggle
[3:03:51] <%BlackStarAura> Throw some raw pasta at them
[3:04:00] <jetstreamlove_R> the rat goblins

[3:04:34] <%RayReborne> Heyburn go eat a turd
[3:04:35] <%Fooguwu> ZAP EM
[3:04:37] <CanadianAnimatorGuy> That noise sounds like tainted love
[3:04:49] <%AnthroMetal> give him the shocker
[3:04:51] <+Emperor_Z> I wonder how many incidents there have been of errant toddlers trying to run through a wall of light
[3:04:57] <$lotharrio> Yeah, sleep on top of the car. Always fun times.
[3:05:03] <%Sir_Gawain_Lotsson> but you DO have Blink 2
[3:05:04] <Vivirmos> Can you super jump to reach?
[3:05:05] <+aWanderingKaivo> or dogs
[3:05:08] <%Fooguwu> probably can with high jump + blink
[3:05:12] <$lotharrio> Break those others so they don't replace them?
[3:05:24] <$lotharrio> Hahahah oops
[3:05:25] <%alcors_wisdom> nothing like whale power or as i like to call it "whawer
[3:05:26] <RushUnplugged> it's fiiiiine

[3:05:59] <Calek> blow up the body
[3:05:59] <JustAnotherTrapArtist> He shouldn't've looked
[3:06:06] <XoftheTITANS> stEAlth
[3:06:09] <%GuilKato> feed body to rats
[3:06:16] <Zombrocom> Feed the rats!
[3:06:17] <jorniev> YEAH RATS
[3:06:19] <+Emperor_Z> It's jarring coming off of Deathloop, where the enemies are stupid and half-blind
[3:06:20] <Laecerelius> Rats!  Rats!  Feed the rats!
[3:06:22] <+ReallyBigRocks> They call him long cone Malone
[3:06:26] <CanadianAnimatorGuy> rats don't care lol
[3:06:35] <lloyddboy> RATS
[3:06:37] <+Etherealizer> what about his head LUL
[3:06:37] <jorniev> rats
[3:06:38] <Coystick> So fucking cool
[3:06:38] <@Ranryu692> mmm those sound effects
[3:06:39] <lloyddboy> WE'RE RATS
[3:06:42] <poisin224> good ratbois
[3:06:47] <%alcors_wisdom> i think it might have been patched out but i remember you could throw a distraction on the otherside of those annihilation gates and the guards would just walk right into it
[3:06:50] <+megaman_sentinel> don't forget the head lul
[3:06:52] <Coystick> God I love this game
[3:06:57] <%Profmcstevie> Oi he said we can't swim! eat him!
[3:06:57] <+goosefoiegras> im da giant rat that eats all of the corpse
[3:06:57] <%Sir_Gawain_Lotsson> those ducts aren't up to code, they need to be insulated
[3:06:59] <jetstreamlove_R> feed the baby rats
[3:07:01] <@QueequegTheater> How goes the mind goblin crusade
[3:07:06] <%Fooguwu> or just jump before blinking
[3:07:12] <$lotharrio> Careful for ninjas
[3:07:19] <+Deekman> @PatStaresAt I didn't get a chance to bring it up on the Outer Wilds stream but if you're in the ATP at the end of a loop something cool happens
[3:07:30] <+Emperor_Z> Fortunately Jim was new on the job, and none of the other guards will recognize his disembodied head
[3:07:32] <%Sir_Gawain_Lotsson> Jebaited
[3:07:34] <jetstreamlove_R> or high jump and blink
[3:07:40] <+ReallyBigRocks> stelf
[3:08:09] <Aiutare47> You can get in through the top
[3:08:09] <%RayReborne> free
[3:08:23] <+aWanderingKaivo> so I only briefly tried dishonored quite a while ago, does the mana just regenerate to a certain percentage? seems pretty high
[3:08:39] <TrollKing96> Is it possible to go lethal and still have Low Chaos?
[3:08:41] <+max_radical> ive got my pc telling me it's not compatible for windows 11, but the health checker saying it is compatible, so windows 11 is off to a good start
[3:08:42] <Heyestus> the note reads, "yo we keep taking these weird carvings off oc the weirdos who wander through"
[3:08:50] <%alcors_wisdom> that situation might sort itself out pat
[3:08:51] <DeadEyeArrow> Basically
[3:08:54] <jtsoppy137> drunken salor
[3:09:17] <%RayReborne> erlie in the morrrnin
[3:09:30] <%GalacticaPhanto> I guess they would be singing sea shanties
[3:09:36] <+Emperor_Z> @TrollKing96 Depends on how lethal. I forget the specifics, but you can kill quite a few people and get the low chaos ending
[3:09:42] <scrumbotime> safely asleep on broken glass bottles in a dumpster
[3:09:42] <%JoshManVGH> @max_radical Schrodingers Compatability
[3:09:48] <%Sir_Gawain_Lotsson> Every time he Blinks it's all soup SourPls time SourPls soup SourPls time
[3:09:51] <+max_radical> has pat conquered the chaos-system related goblins?
[3:09:55] <%Faustgesicht> Fight th goblins; stab a random dude
[3:09:56] <Desthanos> @aWanderingKaivo mana regenerates only to the amount of a light cast spell, like blink or dark vision, so if you cast a large mana cost spell like possession then you'd only get a small amount back to cast stuff like blink.
[3:09:59] <Zombrocom> I think you can kill about a third of the enemies for low chaos?
[3:10:02] <%RayReborne> *Smashes into bottle* eh, you're fiiiiine
[3:10:02] <@QueequegTheater> That broken glass didn't hit any arteries he's fine
[3:10:11] <%SovPho> check left? I think i see rails
[3:10:27] <+Emperor_Z> @Zombrocom How do the main targets factor in?
[3:10:41] <%bassoontyphoon> Street lamps are platforms pat
[3:10:45] <+aWanderingKaivo> @aWanderingKaivo Ah cool One of these days I need to go back and actually play it
[3:10:52] <cheapdoc> You ... did it
[3:10:52] <MaesePC> good job
[3:10:58] <Vivirmos> SeemsGood
[3:11:04] <AvroEltz> Now we get in there, good job pat

[3:11:09] <%KnifeyMcEdge> YOU.... didit
[3:11:10] <jerobees> We're all proud of you
[3:11:12] <Heyestus> @patstaresat how far did you get through this game the first time?
[3:11:14] <+CornyAir> ddvgThumbsUp
[3:11:19] <%Agami23> hey pat, why does this game fill you with anxiety about this but in dues ex you were fine with killing?
[3:11:28] <%Profmcstevie> Agility looks like such a goofy image, "WOAH DUDE SICK JUMP"
[3:11:29] <@commanderclaw> Bend time is THE SHIT
[3:11:30] <@Ranryu692> Bend Time is the SHIT
[3:11:33] <tanarath> Vision or stop time
[3:11:37] <Forbidden_Karp> za warudo?
[3:11:38] <jtsoppy137> THE WORLD
[3:11:41] <+rafaelba93> bend time is broken
[3:11:42] <%alcors_wisdom> devour swarm is very cool bend time is borderline required for some challenges
[3:11:45] <DXLelouch24> literally ZA WARUDO
[3:11:46] <Desthanos> Yeah it's fun being DIO
[3:11:46] <%CzeekyTV> mods o.o
[3:11:48] <+Etherealizer> @Agami23 you dont get bad endings for killing in deus ex
[3:11:50] <Onamar> Yeah its full timestop
[3:11:51] <@QueequegTheater> @PatStaresAt You want bend time ASAP
[3:11:51] <jtsoppy137> lvl2
[3:11:53] <%bevyrage> they detect you much slower
[3:11:53] <emper0rner0> You still get noticed in the first level, but not the second level
[3:11:54] <tanarath> Nope!
[3:11:54] <Laecerelius> Not in the stopped time
[3:11:55] <$lotharrio> ...basically not?
[3:11:56] <PinkSocks> they can, only with level 2
[3:11:56] <+rafaelba93> on lvl 2
[3:11:57] <@Ranryu692> stage 2 yes
[3:11:57] <tj_timbs> no they can. at level 1 anyway
[3:11:58] <+Tucker0603> always go for time stop Kappa
[3:11:58] <%Fooguwu> time is required for vision yes
[3:11:59] <Desthanos> Only level 2 stops time completely
[3:12:02] <@commanderclaw> The first rank is just a slow down, the second one is the full stop
[3:12:04] <Zombrocom> Not in level 2
[3:12:04] <$SGrim> @PatStaresAt not unless you touch them
[3:12:05] <asylumkon> the first tier is just slow time

[3:12:15] <Bluewolf544> Yes its full DIO mode at level 2
[3:12:16] <@Ranryu692> level 1 is slow time, level 2 is full time stop
[3:12:18] <%cobalt_phoenix_> lvl 1 slows time, lvl 2 is ZA WARUDO
[3:12:22] <wizardwally> Lvl 2 Timestop is super good.
[3:12:23] <Zombrocom> Level 1 is slow time, they can still see you, level 2 is time stop, they can't see you
[3:12:24] <jorniev> has anyone here tried playing deus ex while killing everyone?
[3:12:27] <Heyestus> it's  superslow. enemies will still become alerted but it takes like 8x longer @patstaresat

[3:24:27] <%Agami23> apparently the artist said when designing the dogs he "put a little crocodile and a little bit of giraffe in there to make it unique"
[3:24:30] <ElSuperNova> You probably want dark sight next eh?
[3:24:38] <+pectusumbra> might as well use an elixer to pick up that one?
[3:24:44] <%GarbageNirvana> @Louie_Salmon NO OTHER CHOICE

[3:26:05] <%JoshManVGH> Solved it!
[3:26:05] <%RayReborne> i think
[3:26:16] <%JoshManVGH> The dastardly lever puzzle
[3:26:17] <Zombrocom> "Survivor" You sure bout that game?
[3:26:23] <%SveriSageAdvice> why would the hound cage release be in that cage??
[3:26:24] <Paperware> "Survivor"
[3:26:25] <+pectusumbra> I mean it was a baby puzzle for babies
[3:26:29] <person181> you cheat
[3:26:30] <%SovPho> 7 scriptures
[3:26:34] <@Ranryu692> the hound cage release lever was the main thing in there
[3:26:35] <%SovPho> I think?
[3:26:40] <%RayReborne> look in all the cages???
[3:26:42] <%walternatorz> have you asked the rats?

[3:26:59] <%SovPho> Nah that puzzle is later, my bad.
[3:27:18] <%alcors_wisdom> look at the sick hound disposal note and then the seven scripture
[3:27:21] <%jfunkf> my bad
[3:27:28] <%Fooguwu> and it's also an S, not a 5 i think
[3:27:48] <Zombrocom> ?
[3:27:50] <%alcors_wisdom> ah wait what was the note
[3:28:03] <%alcors_wisdom> the answer is in the scripture i remember that
[3:28:08] <+pectusumbra> apparently there's a different specific note for it
[3:28:15] <%bevyrage> are you talking about the ritual for branding?
[3:28:19] <%SovPho> Oh, there it is?
[3:28:23] <%alcors_wisdom> ah thats it
[3:28:26] <+Kduff89> So Im back from class. How go the mind goblins?
[3:28:30] <@Ranryu692> 217
[3:28:36] <tj_timbs> I believe the implication was to use the sick dog to kill the guards

[3:46:45] <%AgniBrandt> You're doing great Pat
[3:46:46] <%Sir_Gawain_Lotsson> Chat is the goblins. Half of us are saying to reload and the other half are saying not to.
[3:46:47] <Rellim80> Dogs
[3:46:49] <+Etherealizer> it's okay pat you're already doing better than most of us LUL
[3:46:50] <%Faustgesicht> It would be more baby to Reload than to live with how the game goes
[3:46:50] <emper0rner0> So is this a one off? Because idk if Pat can do the whole game at this rate
[3:46:51] <+Seitine> üêç
[3:46:55] <XoftheTITANS> is this the first Mind Goblin stream?

[3:47:08] <%Profmcstevie> The chat members saying reload live life as cowards who don't enjoy the comedy of errors
[3:47:11] <%BrotherGaius> game fucks you = reload,  you fuck yourself = no reload, has always been my rule.
[3:47:19] <ennui_on_me> think about it. If you reload then it's ruining your perfect run of not reloading
[3:47:20] <%RealThiele> Pat stares at Cardiac Arrest Part 1 (Final)
[3:47:23] <@DakotaMacDoodle> The Goblins are tricking your body into feeling bad it'll pass
[3:47:26] <%zarkazeon> pat i think the purpose of this was to have more fun. if you want a reload orctwo I say go for it.
[3:47:51] <jorniev> this bit is really crazy
[3:47:52] <suddenlyscorched> HOOOOO
[3:47:55] <+Deadlymuffin5> @zarkazeon Wait, this is supposed to be for fun?

[3:48:02] <tj_timbs> that's nothin

[3:48:28] <%JoshManVGH> Shadow Kill will solve many problems going forward
[3:48:30] <%strakillias> Do shadow kill. It's not like you are gonna play this more after the stream
[3:48:35] <jorniev> remember ITS SOME ENEMIES

[3:49:03] <%NigelSchnauzerpug> @PatStaresAt Do you play on doing Dishonored 2 after?
[3:49:03] <DaCheekyOne> I like watching my favorite streamers suffer
[3:49:05] <%Profmcstevie> Corvo the legend, fucking butter fingers
[3:49:08] <+Mizzda> Went away for a couple hours, how're the goblins going?
[3:49:09] <%Chichen> @PatStaresAt might want to allow yourself like 1 do over a stream
[3:49:12] <%bassoontyphoon> I feel like this is hurting you though
[3:49:13] <$nyxing_it_up> this is my favorite game so id absolutely love to see more
[3:49:14] <+pectusumbra> As long as you do the extra non-lethals on the targets I'm down. Give me that mean stuff

[3:49:24] <%walternatorz> subnautica
[3:49:25] <%baka_sugoi> Salt Streams
[3:49:26] <AvroEltz> Oops, acidental genocide
[3:49:27] <+Undenizen> the problem with this game is you need to pick your path and STICK to it. shadow kill is only good for high chaos.
[3:49:30] <jtsoppy137> Hitman Kappa
[3:49:30] <%RealThiele> thanks paige
[3:49:32] <%AgniBrandt> @PatStaresAt It is legitimately encouraging to see you tackling your mind goblins like this

[3:49:33] <+PenmanLupine> what like Baldurs Gate?
[3:49:35] <jkfd> that's true love

[3:49:40] <%SinnerEbru> paige is out here looking out for chat
[3:49:40] <Zeif00> I doubt those were her exact words
[3:49:41] <%DJFakie> DJFakie subscribed at Tier 1. They've subscribed for 9 months, currently on a 5 month streak! No matter what I'm proud of your efforts tonight
[3:49:41] <%JoshManVGH> "Honey, you need more suffering in your work"

[3:49:44] <+ReallyBigRocks> we all love a good torture stream
[3:49:46] <%polothegreatest> pat wants to become chaos
[3:49:47] <@QueequegTheater> @PatStaresAt Full Subnautica LP incoming
[3:49:49] <%Sir_Gawain_Lotsson> The horror of being trapped in your own mind with your goblins
[3:49:50] <%bassoontyphoon> Why not play Kenshi again then kol
[3:49:51] <Vyskus> this event is going great imo
[3:49:52] <%blankwaffle> what's scarier than facing your goblins?

[3:49:59] <%chiazam> Pat it sounds like Paige just wants you to suffer
[3:50:00] <%castlerock42> Pat, half your schtick is horror games.
[3:50:03] <Zombrocom> Now THAT is a lot o rats
[3:50:03] <%RealThiele> metroid other M is just bad , not like scary or goblin-y, just bad
[3:50:04] <$nyxing_it_up> a true artist suffers
[3:50:11] <%Agami23> be miserable while playing lost in vivo
[3:50:13] <+goosefoiegras> the floor is rats
[3:50:15] <%Mathochism> Rats Can't Climb
[3:50:18] <jorniev> just stab the rats
[3:50:25] <%NigelSchnauzerpug> Paige is trying to get that life insurance by killing Pat with a heart attack
[3:50:31] <%Profmcstevie> I would totally grenade some fucking rats
[3:50:31] <+pectusumbra> they can see you but they can't catch you
[3:50:35] <+pyrojack6> as long as it doesn't reach "KZ playing blinx" levels of dead inside
[3:50:40] <Zeif00> I think it's good Pat's doing something new w/ the channel tbh
[3:50:41] <AvroEltz> Well, i really love this game so i would totally watch you play it every time
[3:50:42] <+mac_6ixx> Make these into eps instead of LP. Meaning ep1 of the Mind Goblins and just keep going
[3:50:45] <jorniev> YEAAAH
[3:50:47] <Madinki> @PatStaresAt Make Paige play No Man's Sky as revenge.
[3:50:48] <MrBaldachin> CLEAVE EM IN TWAIN
[3:50:51] <+goosefoiegras> yes but why
[3:50:56] <+Undenizen> y'know rats can climb and jump no problem.
[3:50:56] <+BoboDaHobo> good thing rats can't climb up onto tables
[3:51:01] <+Undenizen> in real life, i mean
[3:51:01] <sackerkappa> Pat named the big one Bitey.
[3:51:02] <+Etherealizer> murder skaven
[3:51:09] <@QueequegTheater> D:
[3:51:13] <%Profmcstevie> YOU HAVE STARTED A WAR YOU CANNOT WIN RAT KING
[3:51:15] <+Undenizen> oh, ok
[3:51:18] <+goosefoiegras> quickload and stab the rats again
[3:51:18] <+pectusumbra> It's so cool
[3:51:19] <%SinnerEbru> U GOT THIS PATRICK
[3:51:24] <zehdre> it's cool, but murder is cooler
[3:51:24] <%superc37> wwhat if you kill yourself on purpose to reload the save
[3:51:27] <MidnightPacif1c> glad we no longer have that rat problem
[3:51:32] <%bassoontyphoon> The only thing rats can swim in is their own blood
[3:51:36] <%Profmcstevie> It's a game of repeat playthroughs, there is always "do it another run"
[3:51:38] <Coystick> It's cool, but not as memorable as dropping your mark from the ceiling
[3:51:39] <Heyestus> kinda sucks you won't  see a branded overseer later on now, but whatevs
[3:51:39] <%Monkeyweed21> @PatStaresAt did you see the follow-up to your branding?
[3:51:53] <+Undenizen> @MidnightPacif1c i literally have 4 rats on my desk right now.
[3:51:57] <jorniev> THESE GUYS ARE FOR REAL
[3:52:04] <AvroEltz> Look at them all together, you have a granade man, just throw it, hmmmm
[3:52:40] <%Sir_Gawain_Lotsson> yeah that checks out for dog behavior
[3:52:43] <+Undenizen> why is that dog watching him pee?
[3:52:55] <zehdre> damn, those dudes just murdering one another there
[3:52:58] <%RealThiele> i mean actually doing the right thing when he got plagued so good on him
[3:53:06] <%Sir_Gawain_Lotsson> @Undenizen have you ever had a dog or cat
[3:53:14] <jorniev> you have a teleport though?
[3:53:22] <suddenlyscorched> RUN

[3:53:42] <Themagicpillow> As someone who has been a fan of Pat since his Machinima days, and as someone who suffers from severe OCD; this is an awesome stream. I‚Äôve suffered through exposure therapies myself, and Pats right when he said that the only way to help your OCD is to confront it head on. Pat if you happen to read this, I hope this is a good therapeutic experience. Despite how awful it feels.
[3:53:45] <PinkSocks> lmfao
[3:53:47] <%Sir_Gawain_Lotsson> there go ALL the consumables sbfpSetIn
[3:53:47] <%DashXero> Wow, Pat. That's a lotta dead dogs.

[3:54:35] <%RayReborne> oh he HATES the murder achievment Kappa
[3:54:36] <%Profmcstevie> Die you idiot, graaaah
[3:54:39] <suddenlyscorched> He can always bring it back down
[3:54:41] <%Sir_Gawain_Lotsson> GUARDS CAN'T CLIMB
[3:54:44] <%Dova573> At this point fuck IT, CHAOS CHAOS
[3:54:48] <some_brave_apollo> fight five enemies at once and make sure none of them survive
[3:54:48] <suddenlyscorched> Chaos fluctuates as stages progress
[3:54:54] <glunchboy> pat you need to shoot that guy
[3:54:55] <%JoshManVGH> Oh no it's turning!
[3:54:57] <akitanito> can guards swim
[3:54:59] <MrBaldachin> GabeN
[3:54:59] <LoneFonte> do dogs count for chaos progression?
[3:55:04] <+GenesisKnight> I think they know you're here
[3:55:08] <suddenlyscorched> You don't need the valve, actually
[3:55:08] <lloyddboy> RATS
[3:55:09] <Zombrocom> Ok, it's fine, we got time to lower the chaos later
[3:55:18] <DianaTheAscian> RATS
[3:55:22] <suddenlyscorched> You can just go
[3:55:25] <TrollKing96> Can you reduce your Chaos level?
[3:55:26] <%Sir_Gawain_Lotsson> oh my god did the rats come to eat the corpses and just KILL the guards
[3:55:27] <Bluewolf544> As far as i remember you can go full crazy for like 3 missions and if the rest is low chaos you good
[3:55:29] <TheNewJapanGuy> Yep
[3:55:30] <jorniev> YOU DID
[3:55:35] <tj_timbs> correct. there is indeed an alternative
[3:55:40] <suddenlyscorched> @TrollKing96 Sort of
[3:55:59] <Zombrocom> Drink a mana pot and take that one
[3:56:05] <suddenlyscorched> @TrollKing96 The average Chaos level across all stages determines the ending
[3:56:09] <%cobalt_phoenix_> @TrollKing96 in a level, no, you can't unkill a person. but on average you can if you kill less people the next level
[3:56:11] <some_brave_apollo> you don't get mailed anthrax if you have high chaos at the end guys, its not a problem
[3:56:14] <Bluewolf544> @TrollKing96 A single mission wont affect ending
[3:56:14] <lloyddboy> splode it?
[3:56:14] <+Undenizen> pat, you need to activate ALL the vices to get the vice cranker achievement

[4:00:00] <+Arizon1317> @PatStaresAt It might be because you defended yourself and didn't actively try to kill people
[4:00:00] <Coystick> nooooice
[4:00:00] <tanarath> Pat, remember, it's LIBERAL pacifism, not actual pacifism.
[4:00:00] <scrumbotime> THIRTY????
[4:00:03] <+aWanderingKaivo> that's a LOT
[4:00:04] <%SinnerEbru> WOAH
[4:00:04] <%kyh9> HOW IS THAT 20
[4:00:05] <%TIME_PUNCHER> Goblins can't latch on if they realise the system is stupid
[4:00:05] <tj_timbs> damn, lot of dudes in this one
[4:00:07] <jkfd> you shouldn't read that
[4:00:07] <BettyMwwaahh> wow thats pretty lenient
[4:00:08] <zehdre> There's a LOT of guys here
[4:00:09] <Coystick> it's percentile based
[4:00:10] <akitanito> just kill civilians if you want high chaos
[4:00:11] <@commanderclaw> Yeah, you have to go Doom Guy on the guards in order to get high chaos
[4:00:12] <Archmortal> that list does not include the big story targets + hostiles/civilians
[4:00:22] <%SinnerEbru> jesus christ dishonored

[4:00:24] <%Sir_Gawain_Lotsson> I DID A ZERO KILL RUN FOR NO REASON?!
[4:00:24] <%JoshManVGH> So basically MURDER EVERY THING THAT MOVES, or good ending.
[4:00:24] <DensityD> that's as many as four tens and that's terrible
[4:00:24] <%Chichen> ***
[4:00:24] <jkfd> 20%
[4:00:24] <auraofdawn> civilians will really raise your chaos wont they?
[4:00:26] <jorniev> DOES THAT EVEN CHANGE WITH DIFFICULTIES?
[4:00:27] <+BoboDaHobo> it's more forgiving than most people realized. it's all in your head that you're being "punished" for playing "wrong"
[4:00:28] <%kyh9> Mission 2 has 150 people????
[4:00:29] <scrumbotime> so like, don't kill more than a baker's dozen and you should be good 100% of the time
[4:00:30] <+Undenizen> it's really dumb
[4:00:31] <JetpackMcQuack> no one that didn't deserve it
[4:00:32] <Louie_Salmon> There were a TON of guards you didn't kill.
[4:00:34] <+rafaelba93> high chaos is a choice
[4:00:35] <tj_timbs> there was like 140 dudes in this level?????
[4:00:36] <%Profmcstevie> You have to be QUITE an asshole for chaos it seems
[4:00:38] <AvroEltz> Considering there are a lot in the offices and the gang, you can kill a lot of people
[4:00:39] <%Sir_Gawain_Lotsson> sbfpSetIn ALL THAT TIME

[4:00:52] <poisin224> kill 19% of a district? Low Chaos YEP
[4:00:52] <wendigo172> YES
[4:00:55] <%kyh9> Yes, I played high-chaos, it was fun
[4:00:55] <%JoshManVGH> So it's more meaningless than was ever thought
[4:00:58] <lloyddboy> BEGONE, GOBLINS
[4:00:59] <%SinnerEbru> thats a super high number
[4:01:00] <%kyh9> High Chaos Control
[4:01:00] <%bassoontyphoon> You did great
[4:01:00] <@Ranryu692> yeah, high chaos is when Corvo is Death incarnate
[4:01:00] <+aWanderingKaivo> high chaos is waking up and choosing violence
[4:01:00] <PinkSocks> high chaos is murderous psychopath corvo
[4:01:01] <zehdre> Turns out the "bad" ending is the one you have to really work for
[4:01:02] <OkamiDude15> high chaos is you gonna kill every motherfucker in the room
[4:01:03] <emper0rner0> Its almost like you were really wrong about it yeah
[4:01:04] <%JoshManVGH> so Shadow Kill with gusto
[4:01:09] <Coystick> High Chaos is deliberate, no one accidentlies a High Chaos
[4:01:10] <Zombrocom> It's like doing Genocide
[4:01:11] <@ssjklyco> So there is no real penalty for killing 5 people
[4:01:17] <Laecerelius> It's like Undertale!
[4:01:19] <%TubeMan642> Was that not obvious
[4:01:19] <scrumbotime> As it turns out Pat, your goblins were less real than you ever could have imagined.
[4:01:22] <%Ziegsy> you have have little a chaos. as a treat
[4:01:23] <%GabeSweetMan> You ONLY killed a battalion. LOW chaos.
[4:01:30] <%TIME_PUNCHER> it's bad to kill LOTS of people. you can kill a little. as a treat
[4:01:30] <@Moobot> Hey folks, just a reminder! If you have Twitch connected to Discord, you can access the PSA Sub-Discord. Go to your User Settings, go to Connections, and click 'Join' on the PSA server under the Twitch connection.
[4:01:31] <Animal_Farm4> System is fine, it's so you DON'T have to reload after a single fuckup LUL
[4:01:33] <+rafaelba93> i think its nice
[4:01:38] <AvroEltz> Know you know to ignore the chaos and just play like you want
[4:01:38] <%GhoulishCripple> achievements and trophies really were the Goblins all along
[4:01:38] <@ssjklyco> Fix her face
[4:01:40] <some_brave_apollo> i don't understand what you want
[4:01:41] <Bluewolf544> System is fine
[4:01:41] <Archmortal> I think it's great.  They just explained it like absolute shit.
[4:01:44] <+Ironbuttz> were the faces always this bad?
[4:01:48] <DSD24> The system is down
[4:01:50] <akitanito> they didn't sell it properly
[4:01:51] <TheNewJapanGuy> It's only terrible if you wana to kill more than half of every enemy in any given mission
[4:01:53] <Louie_Salmon> YES
[4:01:54] <%Agami23> the explanation
[4:01:54] <%JoshManVGH> The tooltip is terrible
[4:01:55] <OkamiDude15> understandable
[4:01:57] <Vyskus> We're learning!
[4:01:59] <@Ranryu692> yeah, the explanation could be much better
[4:02:01] <wendigo172> @Ironbuttz yes
[4:02:02] <+GenesisKnight> Down with the system
[4:02:04] <+Undenizen> iunno, the system is ALSO bad.
[4:02:04] <%Dylveryn> They implicitly lie to you
[4:02:04] <bakkatohri> You know which game give me massive mind goblins? Pathologic 2. I keep trying to optimize my run from start to finish until I mess something up while trying to save everybody.
[4:02:04] <CubeyXOF> agreed
[4:02:05] <%kyh9> The game very VERY poorly explains how chaos works
[4:02:08] <jorniev> THEY EXPLAIN IT POORLY
[4:02:12] <%RayReborne> Yeah makes it sound like killing anyone will FUCK YOU
[4:02:12] <jorniev> YES
[4:02:13] <Bluewolf544> Yeah i can agree with that
[4:02:14] <tanarath> This system is fantastic. The DESCRIPTION is a fucking crime against humanity
[4:02:16] <tj_timbs> can you bring it up again
[4:02:18] <%Chichen> I'd like to think we killed a goblin today
[4:02:23] <DeadEyeArrow> It's true tho
[4:02:24] <@commanderclaw> The system is fine, but how opaque it is to the player is horrible. If this game had a "Chaos Meter" on the pause screen it'd improve immensly
[4:02:27] <Animal_Farm4> I mean it would have been pretty immersion anihilating if they said "Don't kill more than 20% of the level" LUL
[4:02:29] <lloyddboy> "nonlethal kill"
[4:02:32] <akitanito> ah well, you're playing with no quick load
[4:02:32] <+rafaelba93> its like whoever wrote the tip didnt know shit
[4:02:33] <%JoshManVGH> I think a reload here is fair
[4:02:43] <DSD24> Daytime drinking
[4:02:48] <%JoshManVGH> Goblins seem defeated for general function of gameplay
[4:02:52] <+aWanderingKaivo> I wonder if it would actually be better if it just DIDN'T explain the system
[4:02:52] <DensityD> a banana is a berry
[4:02:56] <jorniev> how did you kill him corvo?  I DONT WANNA TALK ABOUT IT
[4:02:56] <%Profmcstevie> A disappointing accident killing someone is on brand for you, and it made me out loud laugh so it works
[4:03:02] <DensityD> kaboom
[4:03:03] <%JoshManVGH> Atleast for this one
[4:03:12] <DSD24> uh we were having a conversation?
[4:03:13] <+Undenizen> that didn't seem very safe.
[4:03:14] <+RandyFistburgers> Sup nerds
[4:03:19] <BingusTheDingusUltra> the fact that you see a "no kill not seen" check mark at the end of every mission makes it feel like kill counts are suppose to be REALLY low
[4:03:21] <%greasypete00> confetti
[4:03:22] <DSD24> Why are you shooting past my head
[4:03:25] <$SGrim> Confetti gun
[4:03:25] <zehdre> seems on par for a flintlock gun
[4:03:26] <Laecerelius> That's quite the explosion
[4:03:27] <lloyddboy> black powder is big bang
[4:03:30] <+GenesisKnight> It seems like the glass explosion is at the muzzle
[4:03:30] <Heyestus> Shitty old Gunpowder
[4:03:31] <Vyskus> this conversation is stupid as hell
[4:03:32] <jorniev> not really
[4:03:35] <%Ziegsy> hes shooting BEANS
[4:03:37] <Aiutare47> black powder or something
[4:03:37] <%SinnerEbru> congrats!! its a bullet
[4:03:38] <%Faustgesicht> Is glass shooting out of his gun?
[4:03:39] <@Ranryu692> their faces look like smudged oil paintings
[4:03:41] <%RayReborne> the glass is breaking in front of his gun lol
[4:03:41] <Archmortal> they're using sawdust instead of gunpowder
[4:03:42] <DensityD> every muzzle flash is meant to catch your eye and alert you
[4:03:51] <Vivirmos> Look at him using potions
[4:03:55] <jkfd> it's just the flour in the air catching fire
[4:03:57] <%Fooguwu> BibleThump
[4:04:01] <poisin224> damn I'm jealous of Sam
[4:04:01] <+Undenizen> oh that works if you LOOK at people too?
[4:04:04] <%JoshManVGH> Givr upgrades doll man
[4:04:06] <@GeneralSCPatton> It's because it's a [[ psaBig SHOT ]]
[4:04:06] <%cooldude69xx> @BingusTheDingusUltra That really gives you the impression its meant to be binary. Chaos On, Chaos Off
[4:04:08] <%kyh9> Love the exploding bullets late in the game
[4:04:09] <akitanito> big upgrades
[4:04:12] <DensityD> you cant hsndle my strongest potions
[4:04:24] <DSD24> Potion Seller
[4:04:27] <BingusTheDingusUltra> EYYY its pepto bismol!!!
[4:04:30] <+the_glizzy_wizzy> optics
[4:04:31] <%Profmcstevie> Increase BONE
[4:04:37] <@Ranryu692> crossbow reload is good
[4:04:52] <@Ranryu692> that's fair
[4:04:57] <+aWanderingKaivo> howso?
[4:04:59] <+Undenizen> Really, this system feels like it's supposed to have a low, a medium and a high.
[4:05:01] <%Ziegsy> corvo contains at least 3 bones
[4:05:02] <Coystick> He's learning!
[4:05:03] <%Profmcstevie> Too much knowledge is boring
[4:05:05] <DensityD> hes so strong. you are taking the correct runes
[4:05:08] <akitanito> oh no not spirit water
[4:05:14] <scrumbotime> fucked his whole ass
[4:05:17] <%critikal_bit> The ENTIRE ass?!
[4:05:25] <OkamiDude15> @aWanderingKaivo mind goblins making you always have it on
[4:05:30] <%kyh9> denoudaden
[4:05:31] <Laecerelius> Den outta den!
[4:05:31] <DensityD> white
[4:05:39] <DianaTheAscian> the WHOLE ass
[4:05:39] <+aWanderingKaivo> fair enough
[4:05:41] <%Agami23> let me guess, it ruined it because you would use it then take like 3 steps and then wait for the ability to repop shadow vision?
[4:05:41] <zehdre> good job
[4:05:46] <+RandyFistburgers> Ghost juice*
[4:05:47] <+Undenizen> like, i wish there was an option that was "not only am I being violent, I actively want to make things worse"
[4:05:55] <oda_flobunaga> It International Woman's Day-ed him
[4:05:57] <+Etherealizer> those vision modes are really bad in most games because of the way it makes the entire game a different shade of color, I hated it in batman and all the games with a vision mode lol
[4:06:00] <lloyddboy> SPANKED
[4:06:01] <DSD24> why use the word spanked
[4:06:01] <+sashagreenspiderqueen> peepee!
[4:06:18] <ennui_on_me> what other games would be on the list for this series?
[4:06:22] <+Undenizen> that's fair.
[4:06:37] <%kyh9> But it made the game look like shit
[4:06:42] <RrenDa> yeah i hated the tunnels in STALKER just because i was forced to damage my eyes with the green shade
[4:06:42] <%JoshManVGH> What?
[4:06:46] <@Ranryu692> Quantum Break had a pretty good one. You could only use it when you stand still, and then the highlight would fade a few seconds after moving
[4:06:48] <jorniev> mgs4 solved that problem before batman
[4:06:49] <%JoshManVGH> psaBig psaWrong
[4:06:53] <PinkSocks> yep it sucks, glad they nerf it in 2
[4:06:53] <%RayReborne> they fixed it in Arkham knight mostly, imo
[4:06:56] <DSD24> Corvo sleeps with no covers
[4:06:57] <%Fooguwu> HHWWAAFSSHAAAWSHHAAAWHH
[4:06:57] <JetpackMcQuack> metroid prime and splinter cell
[4:06:58] <Djinnazz> Ehh
[4:07:00] <%JoshManVGH> Your Mana regins fine with Darkvision on
[4:07:03] <+goosefoiegras> I played all of oblivion with that terrible night vision filter
[4:07:03] <%RayReborne> not as bad as the oast games
[4:07:07] <%Agami23> you know what would make shadow vision better? make it a pulse and all it does is mark people so you know whats going on
[4:07:07] <+GenesisKnight> There's never a reason to turn off Batman's vision mode
[4:07:07] <%RayReborne> past*
[4:07:16] <Blank9> mgs4 solved nothing, you play that whole game in ENVG solid eye mode and don't get to listen to your ipod
[4:07:17] <jorniev> NOT THE AYUASCA AGAIN
[4:07:24] <%Ziegsy> <Night vision *FWEEEEEEEEE* noise>
[4:07:28] <%JoshManVGH> Cool
[4:07:28] <+Etherealizer> yeah I always feel bad about using those modes considering some dev had to have made those textures lmao
[4:07:29] <oda_flobunaga> Would the Metro games gobble Pat's mind?
[4:07:34] <akitanito> don't psychocrusher me
[4:07:47] <+Undenizen> wait no, were we about to get a psychology lesson?
[4:07:47] <%Profmcstevie> Dang, therapist teasing
[4:07:50] <+Undenizen> i want it
[4:07:50] <+goosefoiegras> que'st que c'est?
[4:07:52] <%polothegreatest> vision mode off only if no ridler tropies in sight
[4:07:54] <@commanderclaw> Happy to see Pat engaging in some exposure therapy
[4:07:58] <%JoshManVGH> "Hey, you like Sewers right?"
[4:07:59] <jorniev> @Blank9 but the solid eye makes noise so you have to watch out against over using it in some parts
[4:07:59] <%Maids4lyfe> twitch please
[4:08:07] <@Ranryu692> it's Phil
[4:08:09] <%bassoontyphoon> Don‚Äôt try and stop us from enjoying our whussies pat
[4:08:12] <+RandyFistburgers> Twas a giant sewer dingus
[4:08:29] <$Futurecity10> yes
[4:08:29] <doster504> @Maids4lyfe glad I'm not the only one
[4:08:30] <%bevyrage> yes
[4:08:31] <@commanderclaw> Yes
[4:08:32] <%kyh9> I don't remember
[4:08:32] <suddenlyscorched> Weepers are people
[4:08:33] <%superc37> yes
[4:08:34] <tj_timbs> i believe so
[4:08:35] <MuFuzzy649> yes
[4:08:35] <%SharkMissile> Sparing a weeper is ehtically wrong
[4:08:37] <Heyestus> it does
[4:08:38] <%Mr_Pylon> yeah
[4:08:39] <Zombrocom> Yeh
[4:08:40] <%Maids4lyfe> is stream buffering a lot for anyone else
[4:08:41] <%superc37> killing ALL humans count
[4:08:42] <@commanderclaw> No, just driven mad
[4:08:42] <$Futurecity10> they can be cured
[4:08:42] <Heyestus> no
[4:08:42] <%JoshManVGH> No just sick
[4:08:43] <%superc37> NOPE
[4:08:44] <DSD24> Wouldn't it be a mercy?
[4:08:44] <%bevyrage> they're still living, just almost dead
[4:08:45] <DeadEyeArrow> Yes
[4:08:45] <%kyh9> Yes but don't be mean to the dead people
[4:08:45] <some_brave_apollo> no, they're just dementia-fied
[4:08:47] <@GeneralSCPatton> I hear "weeper", and my brain jumps straight to the Corprus infected from Morrowind
[4:08:47] <%Fooguwu> the Weepers, shepherd
[4:08:49] <vapelad_dabberb01> they're just sick
[4:08:50] <Dunmarkh> Fucking why does it count?
[4:08:50] <PinkSocks> no they're sick
[4:08:54] <@QueequegTheater> They bring more rats
[4:08:55] <%Profmcstevie> Crazy not dead
[4:08:55] <DianaTheAscian> just insane
[4:08:55] <Zombrocom> Just in a hell of a lot of pain
[4:08:55] <TheNewJapanGuy> No just sick
[4:08:55] <%bevyrage> they're terminally ill
[4:08:56] <%superc37> theyre just really REALLY sick
[4:08:56] <%kyh9> Just put them to sleep so they can die of natural causes
[4:08:57] <%JoshManVGH> But they are civilians, I would think
[4:08:59] <AvroEltz> No, really sick and nuts
[4:08:59] <+bassforte123> it's still about leaving corpses for the rats though, not morality right?
[4:08:59] <RrenDa> @Ziegsy i feel for the irl spec ops people who have to run around with those on for hours on end, i only had to wear a PVS-7 for a few minutes for training and i had migraines afterward
[4:08:59] <@commanderclaw> Think of them like people with terminal dementia
[4:09:00] <%GhoulishCripple> terminally ill
[4:09:01] <%GarbageNirvana> They're like hardcore sick
[4:09:01] <%JoshManVGH> Not YET
[4:09:05] <suddenlyscorched> They're deeply ill and delusional, but killing them is still murder 1
[4:09:05] <Aiutare47> no but they have lost all logic and are just slowly dying of plague
[4:09:06] <%Sir_Gawain_Lotsson> well, not for like a week
[4:09:10] <Teras_ode> not currently
[4:09:11] <supergoblinpunch> Rats eat them
[4:09:12] <Heyestus> they're  parasitically infested.
[4:09:19] <+GenesisKnight> Jesus Pat
[4:09:20] <vapelad_dabberb01> pat about to start taking out the terminally ill
[4:09:22] <%Sir_Gawain_Lotsson> the cure comes out like next week
[4:09:22] <oda_flobunaga> Weepers, what we'd get if Elmer Fudd was the protagonist of Mass Effect
[4:09:23] <some_brave_apollo> pat, do you kill people with terminal dementia
[4:09:26] <TheNewJapanGuy> Yes but you're techinally alive
[4:09:28] <DeadEyeArrow> It's part of the chaos system
[4:09:28] <Aiutare47> its honestly more ethical to kill them quick, but the game says killing is killing
[4:09:29] <%GarbageNirvana> Think of Paige in fifty years
[4:09:33] <%blankwaffle> isn't all dementia terminal?
[4:09:33] <+Undenizen> Pat, any plans for another high psychology game like I Have No Mouth and I Must Scream?
[4:09:35] <%Profmcstevie> Pat about to visit the old folks home naroScared
[4:09:36] <%Fooguwu> terminal dimensia patients should be allowed to die, yeah
[4:09:36] <@commanderclaw> IIRC on low chaos a cure comes out after the game
[4:09:44] <Archmortal> I think there are a couple instances of death by rat that don't count and that's basically it.
[4:09:44] <%GhoulishCripple> imagine if it was terminal dementia and bubonic plague at the same time
[4:09:55] <lloyddboy> literal zombie noises
[4:09:58] <+goosefoiegras> now fucken kill em
[4:10:10] <DeadEyeArrow> Higher chaos makes more weepers. More weepers increase difficulty.
[4:10:11] <%GarbageNirvana> You gotta defeat the weepers, Shepawd
[4:10:15] <+aWanderingKaivo> Pat "if they forgot they get the glock" Boivin
[4:10:18] <+VladVandal> runes Kreygasm
[4:10:24] <@Ranryu692> only 6 more
[4:10:26] <%Ziegsy> I mean, theres quality of life to consider. they are living in a sewer, dying painfully, out of their minds. death would be kind
[4:10:38] <+Undenizen> damn, that sucks
[4:10:41] <+the_glizzy_wizzy> wouldn't killing them be humane.
[4:10:43] <%Dr_Mooose> damn
[4:10:43] <%RigmaroleHM> FeelsBadMan
[4:10:45] <%GinAndRoses> it's a bad way to live
[4:10:45] <+aWanderingKaivo> Yeah, I get that though
[4:10:50] <%RealThiele> its rough to watch
[4:10:50] <%greasypete00> my grandma had dementia andshe was also often sad and angry a lot because she didnt know what was going on
[4:10:51] <%maskofmichael> This is a game Pat, it don't care about you
[4:10:52] <jorniev> fuck
[4:10:52] <OkamiDude15> thats rough FeelsBadMan
[4:10:54] <%CalderGaming> I assume this is your other grandma not the racist as hell grandma
[4:10:55] <@commanderclaw> @PatStaresAt A cure for Weepers comes out a few months after the end of the game on Low Chaos, so not killing them saves them later
[4:10:55] <oda_flobunaga> those wascally Weepers
[4:10:58] <MidnightPacif1c> FeelsBadMan
[4:10:59] <%polothegreatest> it fing sux
[4:11:01] <%Fooguwu> Death is a kindness at that point, yeah :/
[4:11:06] <%HotSauceFiend> is it me or is pat's camera aimed higher than normal its been bugging me for a minute now
[4:11:10] <@GeneralSCPatton> If you get dementia, then you have two deaths
[4:11:14] <Detrius25> tommykSAD
[4:11:14] <+pectusumbra> I'd say agi 2 or save?
[4:11:16] <MuFuzzy649> save for za worldo
[4:11:18] <%GarbageNirvana> My granddad died of Alzheimer's and had serious onset dementia towards the end, so I know
[4:11:21] <@Ranryu692> 5 more for Za Warudo
[4:11:24] <some_brave_apollo> wait, Pat why do you want to live forever if you have a a family history of alzheimers?
[4:11:31] <knoth_> Frankly, if I ad the dementia: I would want someone to shoot me.
[4:11:32] <Laecerelius> Sure
[4:11:37] <@QueequegTheater> My uncle had long term brain cancer that caused dementia near the end of his life
[4:11:38] <+pectusumbra> or Agi II for that fast crouch-move

[4:12:00] <tj_timbs> they ambush you with a cutscene
[4:12:02] <Zombrocom> Hey lady
[4:12:04] <+JustToWatch> GOOD ENOUGH
[4:12:05] <scrumbotime> On a more serious note than my usual "haha pat's balls are full of piss", yeah I have a grandma I haven't seen in a couple years, because she deteriorated so quickly that I just, can't handle seeing her like that.
[4:12:08] <%GarbageNirvana> Honestly if I live long enough for that to be a problem, if they don't have a way to fix it by then I'd rather they just shoot me
[4:12:12] <%Sir_Gawain_Lotsson> she was talking before you showed up
[4:12:15] <PinkSocks> corvo slides in
[4:12:18] <+VladVandal> LUL
[4:12:19] <scrumbotime> And that's not equal to "dying of plague in a hole" people
[4:12:21] <Vivirmos> Working as intended
[4:12:22] <jorniev> FUCK YOU MARTIN
[4:12:25] <+Undenizen> "Corvo. I see you did a slide dodge into the room."
[4:12:32] <HotMafia81> I feel like I would be too terrified to drink anything in this world.  It all looks disgusting
[4:12:34] <Zombrocom> "What the heck is this guy doing. Just just slide into the bar."
[4:12:39] <@Ranryu692> it's weird that they keep saying her full name instead of just "Emily"
[4:12:40] <blackjack8182> Wait Pat still hasn‚Äôt rescued Emily? This game isn‚Äôt that long.
[4:12:48] <%kyh9> Martin is a fucking incel
[4:12:57] <Calek> how's Pat holding it together
[4:12:58] <%CatastropheCorvid> I've just realized that the dude on the left is Belethor's assistant from skyrim. (What was his name?)
[4:13:03] <DSD24> I forget what did Martin do
[4:13:12] <+Undenizen> @blackjack8182 it's longer than 3 hours on a blind playthrough

[4:16:56] <%lemon_rinds> Stop being a wussy and embrace the whussy
[4:16:59] <jorniev> the important thing is for pat not retry out off stream

[4:17:02] <+aWanderingKaivo> the realization
[4:17:03] <%cooldude69xx> streisand whussy
[4:17:03] <some_brave_apollo> immersive sim therapy
[4:17:03] <DianaTheAscian> YOU. DID. IT.
[4:17:04] <@Spydurman> the worst thing that came out of this was w****sy
[4:17:07] <+BoboDaHobo> exposure therapy
[4:17:08] <+Undenizen> ohhhh is THAT what this is?
[4:17:08] <%greasypete00> what about spiders
[4:17:17] <@Spydurman> LUL
[4:17:19] <%superc37> @PatStaresAt so do you plan on ever going back to dishonored or was thi just a one off thing?
[4:17:20] <%Agami23> thats what i've had to do before.
[4:17:22] <akitanito> how much angrier
[4:17:24] <Aiutare47> Angry is better than anxious
[4:17:26] <tanarath> Passing through terror fucking SUCKS
[4:17:26] <%Archphronimos> Congratulations Pat, for real.
[4:17:27] <jimmytwofeet> What's the exact phrasing of the Chaos tooltip?>
[4:17:29] <blackjack8182> But there might be
[4:17:30] <%GabeSweetMan> That's evolution.
[4:17:30] <Coystick> What were the tooltips saying exactly?
[4:17:33] <oda_flobunaga> That is rational
[4:17:36] <+socktrot> yeah, the tooltips are stanky
[4:17:36] <Themagicpillow> I‚Äôm proud of you Pat! Those goblins have bruised balls from where you kicked them!
[4:17:37] <+Undenizen> I mean spiders WILL kill you if you let them.
[4:17:39] <%greasypete00> damn so i was cursed from birth
[4:17:42] <%cooldude69xx> Hell yeah snakes are scary
[4:17:45] <jkfd> just like racism
[4:17:46] <HotMafia81> So what's wrong with me where I find them cute?
[4:17:47] <%kyh9> Fear of the Dark too
[4:17:48] <@Spydurman> those are kinda legit
[4:17:48] <%Ziegsy> Clowns too
[4:17:49] <DeadEyeArrow> Someone read the naked ape
[4:17:49] <Archmortal> THEY'RE POISON, RUN AWAY
[4:17:50] <akitanito> those make sense
[4:17:51] <%Profmcstevie> Reasonable rational fear of small things that may or may not attack you is good
[4:17:51] <%cooldude69xx> But so cool
[4:17:51] <%Mr_Pylon> Fear these shapes that will kill you
[4:17:51] <%GabeSweetMan> You're survival goes UP for being afraid of deadly things. Go figure.
[4:17:52] <%kyh9> Fear of the Deep Sea
[4:17:53] <+aWanderingKaivo> yeah, but it doesn't always go to the extremes that it does for some though
[4:17:56] <+socktrot> i have a phobia about disease which seems pretty reasonable to me
[4:17:56] <%JoshManVGH> So baring the fuckup, how are you feeling about the game?
[4:17:57] <%RigmaroleHM> What about fear of blood
[4:17:58] <DianaTheAscian> Is not having it bad?
[4:18:07] <+bassforte123> "Thank you Chowder for helping me face my completely rational fear."
[4:18:08] <Coystick> I fear the wussy
[4:18:09] <%Ziegsy> cavemen also feared the clown
[4:18:13] <%TIME_PUNCHER> gary busey and the magical whussy voyage
[4:18:15] <$zyberion626> RIP Grog Nug, he didn't have a fear of heights
[4:18:17] <+DatAsuna> My favourite cliff death is the Segway CEO who rode one off a cliff
[4:18:18] <Calek> what if the parachute doesn't open, what if MY parachute doesn't open
[4:18:20] <%Dr_Mooose> thank you
[4:18:23] <%Profmcstevie> AIRPLANE IS NOT NATURAL, MAN IN SKY IS WEIRD
[4:18:23] <HotMafia81> Not a natural act to even be IN an airplane.  Or even know what one is
[4:18:24] <Zeif00> Paige should give you good boi pats
[4:18:26] <%Undenizen> Did you see that video of those skydivers who collided with a plane and it all exploded and they all survived?
[4:18:27] <%RealThiele> RIP Keylith
[4:18:32] <+ReallyBigRocks> literally the point of extreme sports is that they are scary and dangerous
[4:18:33] <tanarath> Cooking food is not a natural act
[4:18:34] <%GabeSweetMan> WHAT?! Are you telling me the story of Daedalus and Icarus is a lie?!
[4:18:35] <CatRidder> fear of CHAOS
[4:18:39] <+socktrot> birds are wild
[4:18:40] <%Puhff> !uptime
[4:18:40] <@Moobot> @Puhff I've been playing this game for how long? Oh only 4h 18m.
[4:18:41] <%Agami23> im starting to get worried about standing beneath kites now because of the podcast
[4:18:44] <vicar_anat> And thus the Cowardly Lion became the Rational Lion
[4:18:44] <+aWanderingKaivo> Pat the Goblinslayer
[4:18:45] <%baka_sugoi> GOBLIN OTHER GAMES
[4:18:46] <+DatAsuna> we do
[4:18:46] <AvroEltz> Really hope you do, you survived the first mission
[4:18:47] <%Mr_Pylon> More
[4:18:47] <a_mad_dragon_> people who take their dogs skydiving NotLikeThis
[4:18:47] <Vivirmos> Being scared is all but the point

[4:18:52] <%Undenizen> I wanna see more PSYCH GAMES
[4:18:53] <Animal_Farm4> I would like to see additional Dishonored :)
[4:18:53] <+JustToWatch> Honestly I'd rather see subnautica
[4:18:53] <+socktrot> more dishonored please :)
[4:18:53] <PinkSocks> yeah it was fun
[4:18:54] <supergoblinpunch> Yes, please
[4:18:54] <Rellim80> 1
[4:18:56] <%Puhff> bitterDab

[4:18:58] <IronGlorfindel> oh yeah, this is great
[4:18:58] <@Ranryu692> I would like to see you experience the full time stop because it's really good
[4:18:59] <%superc37> i would like to see more dishonored
[4:19:00] <blackjack8182> Sure I guess
[4:19:01] <%GabeSweetMan> Goblin Slayer Pat
[4:19:02] <$zyberion626> have no interest in Dishonored, but MORE GOBLIN GAMES
[4:19:05] <%Puhff> FUCK
[4:19:06] <%TheCallousKing> Yes please
[4:19:09] <smoothwood07> i think this goblin excursion was a successful venture! :)
[4:19:09] <%Agami23> i think horror games would be a good go
[4:19:11] <Archmortal> HELL YEAH, SAVE EMILY
[4:19:11] <Blank9> goblin through LISA
[4:19:11] <%Undenizen> @JustToWatch oh heck yeah
[4:19:13] <%polothegreatest> diversify
[4:19:13] <+socktrot> have you played Deus Ex: Human Revolution?
[4:19:14] <wendigo172> Im down
[4:19:15] <northern18> more dishonored!
[4:19:17] <%bassoontyphoon> I think Lisa the Painful would hit your goblins real hard
[4:19:18] <oda_flobunaga> @PatStaresAt do you have a public list of Goblin games?
[4:19:19] <Coystick> Thief might be good for anti goblins, since your consumables and money for consumables reset every level.
[4:19:21] <%castlerock42> I want to see you fight real life goblins.
[4:19:24] <%NigelSchnauzerpug> More.
[4:19:25] <%TheCallousKing> what games would you be interested in trying?
[4:19:26] <Zeif00> Events are better than no events
[4:19:27] <AvroEltz> There are the 'UNKNOWN PARTS'
[4:19:27] <%Profmcstevie> Is it time for Deus Ex
[4:19:27] <CatRidder> but did you slay any goblin??????????????
[4:19:29] <+BoboDaHobo> would definitely watch more Dishonored
[4:19:32] <sackerkappa> Would XCOM 2 summon mind goblins?
[4:19:32] <%GhoulishCripple> I'm down to clown with Big Goblin Slaying.
[4:19:34] <+BigCoffee> high chaos dishonored is actually boring tbf
[4:19:37] <%JoshManVGH> And we still need to see you do non lethal boss kill
[4:19:38] <%walternatorz> I need Subnautica injected to my veins
[4:19:38] <%GabeSweetMan> "I can now use EVER ELIXER AND ETHER IN MY INVENTORY!"
[4:19:39] <HotMafia81> The Goblist
[4:19:41] <peyodogo> cheering for the goblins' eviction, guy!
[4:19:43] <%Ziegsy> do overcooked but dont 3 star the levels
[4:19:44] <oda_flobunaga> ahhh
[4:19:47] <+goosefoiegras> rimworld is my ultima goblin game
[4:19:47] <@Ranryu692> because we will inevitably weaponize it against you?
[4:19:48] <%NigelSchnauzerpug> What are goblins games? I missed the beginning of the stream.
[4:19:49] <Vyskus> I would actually be pretty pumped for more dishonored or like subnautica
[4:19:51] <DianaTheAscian> for the surprise
[4:19:52] <Dunmarkh> Add eye divine cybermancy to it coward
[4:19:53] <FullMetalEmblem> where do you get dat shirt
[4:19:53] <Vivirmos> I wanna see you enjoy yourself and have fun man
[4:19:56] <%Mr_Pylon> Is the peak goblin game an rpg with questionable builds and consumableitmes?
[4:19:56] <%GabeSweetMan> Do not trust us Pat.
[4:19:57] <%Profmcstevie> TODAY A CHAOS RUN, TOMORROW A SMALL POTION USED
[4:19:57] <%Sir_Gawain_Lotsson> I wish I could pet the Emlo he so fluffy and good
[4:19:58] <Heyestus> XCOM has gotta be on there.
[4:19:59] <+DatAsuna> Consider this: the story is bad and the low chaos ending is barely different
[4:19:59] <+aWanderingKaivo> Celeste
[4:20:01] <@StridentSong> There's a poll for more Dishonored if you guys want to vote
[4:20:01] <%RayReborne> Big surprises!!
[4:20:01] <%Puhff> Overlord is a good goblin game Kappa
[4:20:02] <%TheCallousKing> that's fair
[4:20:04] <Coystick> Fuck XCOM 2 would be the ultimate goblin, that or Darkest Dungeon
[4:20:05] <Aiutare47> @PatStaresAt would it be better to give us a list and tell you what we'd be interested? What would you want to play?
[4:20:05] <%Agami23> lost in vivo is a survival horror game that would probably trigger some goblins, because of ammo conservation
[4:20:13] <+RemedyofRevenge> has Pat tried Death Trash?
[4:20:15] <theshillman> YOU SUCK
[4:20:15] <CatRidder> OG Xcom
[4:20:18] <+rafaelba93> thats why you gotta play it
[4:20:21] <rudybrossard> WHERE THE MIND GOBLINDS AT!!
[4:20:22] <Dunmarkh> You just aren't ready for fuller auto
[4:20:23] <+pectusumbra> Can give Iratus a shot as your Darkest Dungeon game
[4:20:23] <theshillman> eye is fucking balling
[4:20:24] <+goosefoiegras> orcs must die has goblins i think
[4:20:27] <%maskofmichael> pLaY tHe NeXt GoBlIn GaMe
[4:20:32] <%bassoontyphoon> Cruelty Squad???
[4:20:33] <%JoshManVGH> How about that gravekeeper simulator game?
[4:20:39] <%blankwaffle> cruelty squad though
[4:20:43] <%GhoulishCripple> is Greed Fall a goblin inducing game for anyone else in chat? I dunno what about that game gives me big goblins but it's big
[4:20:43] <%Profmcstevie> Death Trash made a profit already, glad for them
[4:20:48] <+aWanderingKaivo> wash off the goblin juice
[4:20:50] <ennui_on_me> Cruelty Squad is hella good
[4:20:51] <+ReallyBigRocks> Pat did you go back to Satisfactory much after your streams?
[4:20:52] <akitanito> wash away that anxiety sweat
[4:20:52] <+pectusumbra> I'm drinking water and going to bed, good night
[4:20:52] <rudybrossard> How many showers today
[4:20:52] <RushUnplugged> shower the goblins away
[4:20:53] <Vivirmos> Can you call goblins slain if you don't finish?
[4:20:55] <oda_flobunaga> any city buildr would probably do it
[4:20:56] <%JoshManVGH> Cleansing goblin shower
[4:20:56] <%Mr_Pylon> yeahhhhh cruelty squad
[4:20:57] <scrumbotime> Goblins can't swim
[4:20:58] <sackerkappa> I'd like to see the return of Commander Boivin in the XCOM 2 game after Woolie betrayed humanity for a jetpack...
[4:21:05] <+socktrot> socktrot subscribed with Prime. 
[4:21:07] <%Puhff> Graveyard Keeper actually fixed the mind goblins I have about Stardew Valley
[4:21:10] <%Monkeyweed21> Play Blood Bowl 2 and watch your players permadie
[4:21:17] <%Ziegsy> theres that rpg where one of your party members is a traitor and you periodically have to kill a party member off without knowing if they are the traitor. thats SUPER mind goblins
[4:21:21] <%Puhff> hey me too!
[4:21:27] <%Puhff> wanna shower together?
[4:21:36] <Djinnazz> Why??
[4:21:38] <%GabeSweetMan> Did... did you play that game??
[4:21:39] <%Sir_Gawain_Lotsson> @Puhff lawlmanWeird
[4:21:40] <@Ranryu692> wow I didn't even see the poll lol
[4:21:42] <+aWanderingKaivo> @GhoulishCripple well it does have the % based skill checks that you can just reload to pass, and the randomized loot you can just reload to reroll.. so yeah, it could count
[4:21:43] <%Goatbait> Congrats on fighting the mind goblins and winning today!
[4:21:46] <%Monkeyweed21> pat did that, Woolie is the one who cowarded out
[4:21:46] <Louie_Salmon> Didn't Pat already do that?
[4:21:49] <+DatAsuna> You mean delete his backup
[4:21:50] <%GhoulishCripple> @ziegsy that sounds like actually suffering
[4:21:50] <Zombrocom> Isn't it already deleted?
[4:21:51] <%polothegreatest> why?
[4:21:59] <%JoshManVGH> Kobolds of Chat
[4:22:07] <maybefalco> pat literally deleted his save file live on stream when he played it lmao
[4:22:12] <Laecerelius> You cannot defeat us!
[4:22:13] <+DatAsuna> @Zombrocom it was backed up first lol
[4:22:22] <Qsmash_> ???
[4:22:23] <%Agami23> oh boy, that tales of arise DLC is a thing
[4:22:28] <scrumbotime> Goblins are at least slightly wounded
[4:22:33] <%Sir_Gawain_Lotsson> more like Goblin Encounter Survived
[4:22:37] <+DatAsuna> yeah the SAO DLC made me laugh
[4:22:40] <%Faustgesicht> Still proud of ya pat
[4:22:41] <@Ranryu692> Pat I don't have any money to donate tonight but I'm proud of you, you did a great job tonight!
[4:22:41] <+DatAsuna> It's weirdly high budget
[4:22:44] <Laecerelius> I wish Arise had multiplayer like every Tales game before it.
[4:22:44] <+JustToWatch> 30 years of goblin these nuts
[4:22:47] <+DatAsuna> I assumed it would be just costumes
[4:22:47] <%Ziegsy> @ghoulishcripple Its called lost dimension! its HORRID
[4:22:48] <RushUnplugged> goblins are weaknened but never truly killed
[4:22:54] <%Profmcstevie> The Goblin has got a weakness stack, we must continue
[4:22:58] <%socktrot> how do you do sub messages, i think I messed it up
[4:23:03] <%socktrot> not that I have anything to say really
[4:23:05] <CanadianAnimatorGuy> OH SHIT WATER
[4:23:08] <+DatAsuna> @Laecerelius I wish Arise had a lot of series staples :<
[4:23:09] <%CalderGaming> LMAO
[4:23:13] <%GhoulishCripple> @ziegsy I'm disgustingly curious
[4:23:20] <%RigmaroleHM> LUL
[4:23:23] <+ScrapKingKeita> Wait is THAT where your bit comes from?
[4:23:36] <%Sir_Gawain_Lotsson> it's the 3rd reddit result after two posts about YOU Pat
[4:23:40] <+aWanderingKaivo> he saves the goblins but not the british goblins
[4:23:42] <%kyh9> Love the Pat-Muppet voice
[4:23:43] <%Monkeyweed21> BUT NOT THE BRITISH CHILDREN
[4:23:44] <@Ranryu692> @ScrapKingKeita no, it comes from the other rat game, Plague's Tale: Innocence
[4:23:50] <Laecerelius> They REALLY didn't want to animate those rats swimming
[4:23:55] <%GabeSweetMan> The Bible is METAL AS FUCK.
[4:23:58] <%baka_sugoi> thats METAL
[4:24:01] <%GabeSweetMan> Revelations is CRAZY metal.
[4:24:12] <%kyh9> @ScrapKingKeita What does Eli have to say about Innocence?
[4:24:16] <scrumbotime> The orb is buoyant
[4:24:18] <%cooldude69xx> "Yo, Ghost is the shit bro" -Cardinal Killboss
[4:24:20] <ennui_on_me> Blasting Dying Fetus outside the vatican
[4:24:28] <%GhoulishCripple> okay but Ratatouille had a DvD bonus that said Rats can swim super fucking good tho
[4:24:30] <@Ranryu692> @ScrapKingKeita probably that it's overrated
[4:24:33] <Djinnazz> you don't
[4:24:34] <%cobalt_phoenix_> for real tho good job
[4:24:37] <%RigmaroleHM> I know how uncomfortable it can be so good on you
[4:24:37] <%Mr_Pylon> but you're doing it for dollars and clout
[4:24:39] <+aWanderingKaivo> in front of hundreds of people
[4:24:39] <@Spydurman> we're proud of you
[4:24:40] <%GabeSweetMan> Biblical descriptions of angels are lovecraftian.
[4:24:41] <%RealThiele> you doin a pride task so we helpin
[4:24:43] <@QueequegTheater> @PatStaresAt You're short and smelly and bad at video games
[4:24:43] <%maskofmichael> But your on camera, so you're special
[4:24:44] <%SinnerEbru> shit we love you too pat
[4:24:46] <%JoshManVGH> But to do so in front of hundreds of people seems laudable
[4:24:47] <+sashagreenspiderqueen> do it for the content
[4:24:47] <%Agami23> its making me think about fighting my goblins too.
[4:24:49] <@QueequegTheater> Is that better
[4:24:50] <%polothegreatest> thats the spirit
[4:24:57] <scrumbotime> Hey, as someone who struggles with mental biz myself, I can at least give acknowledgement of other people's little victories
[4:24:58] <%Archphronimos> You still deserve praise Pat
[4:25:04] <%JoshManVGH> No fucking way!
[4:25:04] <CanadianAnimatorGuy> Yeah that's too bad
[4:25:16] <+ScrapKingKeita> The song list is FUCKING GARBAGE

[4:25:20] <+ScrapKingKeita> aside from Hand in  Hand
[4:25:23] <%Taisuru> No Traverse Town either
[4:25:28] <jorniev> not even rage awakened
[4:25:31] <@QueequegTheater> @PatStaresAt Either Doomguy or Master Chief would've gotten more music
[4:25:36] <+Rofiarf> i missed the stream, are the goblins defeated?
[4:25:36] <FrostedZaibatsu> No Vector to the Heavens.. BibleThump
[4:25:37] <%notsoy> we wouldn't have had this issue if doomguy was the final DLC
[4:25:42] <@Ranryu692> I'm sad that the annoying Sora stans are happy. not the normal, reasonable fans, just the asshole ones
[4:25:44] <%kyh9> @ScrapKingKeita YOU DONT GET RISING TENSION YOU DONT GET ANY ORGANIZATION TRACKS YOU WILL TAKE THESE MILQUETOASTE KH1  TRACKS AND LIKE IT
[4:25:48] <%GalacticaPhanto> look id
[4:25:48] <Laecerelius> Man Traverse Town's theme is great.

[4:25:50] <%GabeSweetMan> Traverse Town is soooo good. Sad it's not in there either.
[4:25:57] <+ActiveLink> they would have to deal with a jp music label for any version of Simple and Clean

[4:26:35] <%kyh9> @notsoy Yeah but Doom fans arent' autistic enough to mass-submit their character for the Smash Ballot.  Hell, the Ballot took place before Doom 2016 came out
