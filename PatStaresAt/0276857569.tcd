[0:02:10] <+Freelance7> I'm writing a novel, and I was thinking of what to do next in the fight I'm writing, and I just decided the protagonist will get german suplexed. Is this a good idea?
[0:02:10] <sultanyz3> Everyone is riding the RE2 train lol
[0:02:10] <knomad2b> here to judge pats re skillz

[0:02:20] <+pleasenameyourcharacter> Due only to Pat's stream, I have been listening to this song on loop for about a week now. I CAN'T stop.
[0:02:30] <tibbar5179> spoiler alert: elmo is a licker
[0:02:30] <Valask> @Freelance7 does it look cool though
[0:02:32] <+RilsRislan> Well, Part 17 was put up early alongside TMS, and was manually privated, but wasn't fixed.
[0:02:36] <JZPotter> @yourbuddycarl A DA WAAAAIIT
[0:02:37] <+TheGershon> Shapp-shifter
[0:02:38] <kwangalang> seriously the fe lp is doing horribly. it's my getting more than 14k views
[0:02:40] <ArtThouBored> I wanted RE2 to be like REmake tbh
[0:02:41] <Joel_thetroll> German suplexes are always a good idea
[0:02:45] <grizzlywhisker> does anyone actually watch that tokyo mirage LP they have on the channel? it seems really lame and boring i wish it would end already
[0:02:47] <kwangalang> it's not*
[0:02:47] <+Freelance7> @Valask I mean...it's a german suplex.
[0:02:50] <%D_day> YEET
[0:02:51] <ArtThouBored> Better game
[0:02:52] <%Dingus_Tickler> @pleasenameyourcharacter This is my wakeup alarm. This song doesn’t get old
[0:02:53] <Tyleetow> i saw detroit part 17 and heres some spoilers; hank and connor do the fusion dance to defeat ultra instinct marcus
[0:02:56] <$GohanEgret> I watch FE all the time, side quests are great
[0:03:00] <blackbaron98> yerrrrr
[0:03:03] <Daniel_Is_I> @grizzlywhisker I watch it and I like it. Come at me.,
[0:03:04] <carnelg> sbfpBleetz bleetzball
[0:03:05] <Valask> @Freelance7 Yeah but you gotta make it look cool
[0:03:08] <TafferAA> @Tyleetow dude wtf
[0:03:14] <+pleasenameyourcharacter> @dingus_tickler it's my go to sleep song
[0:03:15] <+Freelance7> @Freelance7 It's a novel...
[0:03:15] <%Dingus_Tickler> Watching #FE LUL HaHAA
[0:03:16] <summerjinki> Seems they dont care if people like the FE lp tho, cuz theyre jsut having so much fun
[0:03:18] <Darren716> TMS is a legit great lp that no one is giving a chance
[0:03:19] <grizzlywhisker> i'm just waiting for another matt/pat LP on the channel because woolie drives me nuts lol
[0:03:19] <+TheGershon> @grizzlywhisker Nah man, it's actually a pretty fun time. The game has enough dumb bullshit to keep the laughs rolling
[0:03:22] <ryu1299> the FE lp is actually great
[0:03:23] <Revan122800> Can't want for the new game, it'll be my first RE game.
[0:03:24] <heytakeiteasyterry> re 2 remake?
[0:03:26] <nekodelic> I'm watching ultra despair girls lp
[0:03:28] <Kaldrion> Still no Ep you hack frauds
[0:03:31] <+LuckyChocobo> i might bing FE when the LP is over.
[0:03:32] <ryu1299> I was surprised but yeah it's good
[0:03:38] <JZPotter> @heytakeiteasyterry No. That's not out yet.
[0:03:39] <+Rolandknight> wish he start earlier
[0:03:39] <otaku9392> its a persona game its long
[0:03:45] <TafferAA> Only reason I'm not watching it is because I'm waiting for the switch version Kappa
[0:03:46] <%Dingus_Tickler> I watch Tokyo Mirage Sessions like I watch Dang Ole Grandpa LUL
[0:03:46] <Prevot> TMS is a trash game tho
[0:03:51] <%D_day> LP shaming in my chatroom DansGame
[0:03:51] <FenixSeraph> I'm still catching up with God of War, will probably do the same with TMS once I'm done with that
[0:03:53] <jack_s1n> bring back German spy
[0:03:55] <iwa5h4ck3d> I actually like the tms lp
[0:03:58] <$GohanEgret> the problem with the FE LP is the early slog through dungeons, after that it picks up mostly
[0:03:58] <888deathkid888> i let it get some so i benge it and now its out of hand
[0:04:00] <%Dingus_Tickler> Anime is bad
[0:04:02] <blackbaron98> finally beat persona 5 a few weeks ago. amazing game
[0:04:03] <+CerberusDriver> is Pat PISSING
[0:04:04] <+Freelance7> @Valask It's a novel, so it would be hard to make it "look" cool. But I can try to describe it's cool
[0:04:06] <+nogoodusernamesleft156> songs really pretty
[0:04:10] <+CerberusDriver> Pat emptying his dick
[0:04:11] <sultanyz3> @artthoubored the idea of REmake being tank fixed camera was way before they introduced re4 , also cashcom wants to make their games action-ish
[0:04:14] <grizzlywhisker> i honestly have a hard time getting into any of the LPs with woolie on the controls lol
[0:04:16] <kwangalang> like seriously should the best friends still do lps of turn based jrpgs ?
[0:04:18] <viewtifulr> pissing ball control pat
[0:04:20] <+a_turnt_egg> Pat is letting out a hot piss load
[0:04:24] <+TheGershon> Yeah the combat seems pretty fun where they're at, will all those session chains
[0:04:28] <Valask> @Freelance7 Hey, you chose this medium, make it work DansGame
[0:04:31] <Spydurman> I can hear Pat pissing in the bathroom
[0:04:32] <iwa5h4ck3d> watch the first 5 minutes of part51 of tms and see if you like it
[0:04:36] <+TootPirate> long and hard massive piss payload delivery
[0:04:38] <%RilsRislan> You fools

[0:04:52] <grizzlywhisker> i watched it for a few minutes here and there and always turned it off because it was super boring to me.
[0:04:53] <+Freelance7> @Valask I ain't just gonna say she got german suplexed, if that's what you're thinking.
[0:04:54] <FenixSeraph> Is the audio fixed? Yesterday it was going nuts
[0:04:55] <Daxalog> No 9 o clock video today?
[0:04:58] <+nogoodusernamesleft156> @grizzlywhisker that's unfortunate! woolie is my dude!

[0:22:38] <elementofloyalty> ELMO
[0:22:41] <$FlubbedPig> cheer200 Only time I've been stung was as a child when a hornet/wasp landed on the back of my neck and I went into statue mode crying and shaking hoping it flew away and I was surrounded by people who couldn't help me and then it stung the crying wimpering child who was me. Sting wasn't THAT bad in retrospect, but anticipation like that'll traumatize you right the fuck up.
[0:22:41] <%Remery_> Lalafell Plague?

[0:23:47] <+alphonseisbest> @operator_san what?!
[0:23:47] <+Feralspirit41> what if homeless elmo came up with a syringe full of space
[0:23:51] <@JustinianKnight> I feel that way with FF7
[0:23:53] <elementofloyalty> Nemisis
[0:23:53] <BigRooster83> @CerberusDriver Awesome, thnx
[0:23:55] <ape_hawk> nemesis
[0:23:57] <flying_man_3> "He looks like Neon Leon Decaprio"?
[0:23:57] <vivecdidnothingwrong> Nemisis
[0:23:58] <+just_shade2222> Heat the syringe
[0:23:58] <+arcadeking48> What is Paige drinking? That looked vile
[0:24:00] <%jediwatchman11> rocket launcher
[0:24:04] <Wannabe_Reviewer> @Sloth2012 So you're mad at Pat for talking when that is part of what he alwsy does? That's like being mad at a dog for barking. Why are you here if you hate that part?
[0:24:06] <cant_pick_a_name> pyramid head is supernatural tho
[0:24:07] <YourFalloutCompanion> Nemesis obviously
[0:24:09] <SainVt> pyramid head is based on remorse
[0:24:09] <$GohanEgret> pyramid head is in your head, tho
[0:24:10] <+AncelDeLambert> You can't beat your own personal demons, Pat
[0:24:10] <elementofloyalty> Nemisis is faster
[0:24:13] <+pleasenameyourcharacter> Pyramid Head is invincible due to magic, though
[0:24:13] <ape_hawk> rocket launcher vs greatsword
[0:24:13] <studleydoorite> Squid1 Squid2 jermaSlug
[0:24:15] <Firesparks> pyrmaid is magic, nemsis is super science
[0:24:16] <operator_san> @alphonseisbest im not sure if you actually didnt know what he was playing ?
[0:24:16] <%Wool> yeye
[0:24:16] <BigRooster83> what about the Tyrant?
[0:24:18] <+tigerfang86> Pyramid head has psychological damage but nemesis is literally a tank with no brain issues
[0:24:20] <KaiserRolled> correct
[0:24:21] <SainVt> so pyramid would cease existing
[0:24:22] <Stebdavee> Pyramid Head is slow as fuck
[0:24:22] <+TeethMuncher> Is Pyramid Head the punisher?
[0:24:22] <reonome> DETROIT IS UP
[0:24:23] <elementofloyalty> Mr X
[0:24:24] <+pleasenameyourcharacter> oh, fair enough
[0:24:25] <zwilliams07> Who says Nemesis doesn't feel guilt?
[0:24:26] <harmlessgs> pyramid head might not even exist
[0:24:29] <JustGinja> nemesis can regenerate, know?
[0:24:34] <hydroarsonist69> T H A N K S B I L L Y
[0:24:34] <%Remery_> but pyramid is shirtless
[0:24:34] <%TeaJayGee> woman cant read, so why is paige pretending
[0:24:35] <JustGinja> No?*
[0:24:36] <SainVt> oh GOD i feel like im in high school all over again
[0:24:37] <$GohanEgret> but nemesis is that guy from the first RE movie Kappa
[0:24:37] <%Agami23> so nemesis would win against ghostrider
[0:24:38] <vivecdidnothingwrong> Pyramid Head is also super fucked up, physically speaking
[0:24:40] <elementofloyalty> Nemesis is ROIDS
[0:24:44] <FenixSeraph> aren't Tyrants made from suffering young men?
[0:24:46] <Etherealizer> Nemesis has a rocket launcher.
[0:24:48] <mrjohncarlton> So literally Freddy vs Jason again?
[0:24:52] <+alphonseisbest> @operator_san i did not when i asked. i do now
[0:24:53] <%gurrren_lagannn> apatElmo
[0:24:54] <puddingpants88> pyramid hear can't die. it just stops existing
[0:24:55] <Phantonbat> Nemesis has a rocket launcher
[0:24:56] <+tigerfang86> pyramid head would have a drink with nemesis
[0:24:59] <+stuffinmybeard> these two nerds streaming in their jammies is definitely a relationship goal
[0:25:00] <vivecdidnothingwrong> What no
[0:25:00] <b1gboss007> Utanahk
[0:25:01] <YourFalloutCompanion> Nemesis is Scott Steiner
[0:25:02] <%Kalz0ne> thats a stupid rule though
[0:25:02] <yourbuddycarl> basically @mrjohncarlton
[0:25:02] <ape_hawk> THE RULE
[0:25:03] <%SuperCasualBoom> Freddy vs Jason Infinite!!!
[0:25:03] <+AncelDeLambert> Okay, I will accept this logic
[0:25:05] <$FriedMattato> Nah, I think Nemesis would win in a straight fight.
[0:25:06] <elementofloyalty> OD a
[0:25:07] <hydroarsonist69> PAT. BITCH NIGGA GHOSTS THO
[0:25:07] <Kavtech> That's not true.
[0:25:08] <ArtThouBored> But what if its the PH from Homecoming
[0:25:08] <fireking900> Nemesis feels guilty about being alive
[0:25:08] <DagetSparrow> Only Pyramid Head can kill Pyramid Head
[0:25:09] <NYCrownlessKing> so ur saying freddy beats jason @AngriestPat
[0:25:09] <+stuffinmybeard> but also a relationship GIVE UP
[0:25:10] <+Tonku_the_Red> @puddingpants88 That's dying. . .
[0:25:10] <+Loyks> FINALLLY
[0:25:11] <+DarkNerdShawny> Whats a rocket launcher to a ghost?

[0:45:16] <tank7013> @mayorrev So you can play as either Leon or Clair. When you beat the game as them, you can use that save file to start a new game as the other. Some gameplay elements are different and some things you can do in the "A" scenario affect the "B" scenario

[1:03:26] <+arcadeking48> @DeaconBluesClues She's knocked out for a while, so I think that's the explanation
[1:03:29] <+DeaconBluesClues> @mars_driver so nemesis didn't find and murder her for like 2 days straight
[1:03:31] <Phantonbat> @DeaconBluesClues She's unconscious for two days dude
[1:03:33] <rytisone> nemesis jumps in here in RE3

[1:04:40] <TheMilhouseExperience> Love the save room theme.
[1:04:40] <Jonesman64> cause manual aim is utter garbage
[1:04:42] <kensan900> auto aim is for pussies

[1:34:58] <+arcadeking48> @KittenHachiChan18 There's in-game posters and whatnot apparently featuring a real life cat named Minmo. Mat and Pat talk about it in their LP
[1:35:00] <metallic_snake> this the GameCube version?

[1:41:43] <alextrebeken> @vivecdidnothingwrong games done slow
[1:41:44] <AdmiralPrawn> I always hated how the shotgun took up two slots in RE Zero.
[1:41:44] <soundoftruth64> Rest In Peace zapping system
[1:41:46] <+Nephthyz> Would you let a licker lick you, Pat?
[1:41:46] <laguerrilha> This has the Assassins Creed zapping system?
[1:41:56] <%KittenHachiChan18> Assassins Creed has a zapping system?
[1:41:57] <vivecdidnothingwrong> @alextrebeken How could I forget
[1:41:59] <AdmiralPrawn> You know what they should bring back for RE2 remake? The Hookshot.
[1:41:59] <elementofloyalty> SMASH
[1:42:02] <grizzlywhisker> REmake 2 is going to be sweet because we get T virus zombies which are cooler than las plagas and molded combined
[1:42:02] <dukenux> gl on your speedrun pat. goodnight chat
[1:42:03] <+AmaniIsYourBoss> Crimson Head Mr. X tho
[1:42:03] <OspreySoul> I remember there was a moment in Rev2 where I was horrified that they might pull a resurrection of Steve.
[1:42:06] <+ymorn> just realized, Pats gonna be playing an RE game around a Games Done Quick again
[1:42:07] <MyNameIsRasus> Man gotta tell you guys, using the smough armorset and a greatsword in ds1 breaks that game
[1:42:09] <$GohanEgret> FrankerZ
[1:42:10] <FstSergeant8595> @thewhiterice92 I thought it started out great but now it is getting real slow and it is way less deep than the first season

[1:42:16] <elementofloyalty> PATS MOM
[1:42:16] <+kaitochi20> GOTTA GET THE FUSE

[1:43:07] <thewhiterice92> @FstSergeant8595 It could just be the beaach episode wasn't all that great, but yeah it just doesn't feel the same..which I sorta figured it wouldn't.
[1:43:07] <+DrBunn> it looks great

[1:43:15] <elementofloyalty> Paige is ordering a Mustard Wedding cake
[1:43:15] <+Nephthyz> Are you covering up her death, Patricia?
[1:43:16] <KaiserMario> She's pregnant
[1:43:16] <soundoftruth64> I think they will just change the timing so us people think it’s gone just for it to fuck us over
[1:43:16] <+FrostMass22> Press F to pay respects to the Wicdonald's Pope F

[1:43:28] <+DrBunn> I actually played a N64 version last year, so its jarring to see this. I like it though
[1:43:28] <mr_slaide> Big...
[1:43:32] <BinaryBetrayer> Part of the charm of the game in my memory was that it looked like pixelated garbage
[1:43:32] <vivecdidnothingwrong> Nevuh fohget
[1:43:34] <OspreySoul> How'd she enjoy that twist?
[1:43:38] <%KittenHachiChan18> THis was on N64?

[1:43:52] <elementofloyalty> @Sowlith Elmo is beside Pat
[1:43:53] <FstSergeant8595> @thewhiterice92 It seems more like they are trying to target more mainstream audiences with this one than the first season
[1:43:53] <Louisciphre20> I... I always closed the other hallway
[1:43:56] <BinaryBetrayer> Expansion pack required
[1:43:59] <+DrBunn> im old :(
[1:43:59] <%ThatGuyfromMars> @KittenHachiChan18 it was the best on n64, load times nonexistent

[1:44:29] <thewhiterice92> @FstSergeant8595 it does feel that way, it feels like the focus is more on Haruko and her twin fighting than anything
[1:44:31] <alextrebeken> pats only 31?
[1:44:37] <germanmafia23> You could see the sadness on his face as soon as he said "20 years old"

[1:52:55] <rytisone> It was Leon's boner for Ada
[1:52:56] <+pleasenameyourcharacter> i just remembered that one of the first gaming magazine issues i ever read had a big section on "Femme Fatales of Gaming" or something. It was 2 pages of the writer jerking off to Ada Wong, Bloodrayne, and Mileena. MILEENA. WHY?
[1:52:56] <thewhiterice92> So he'd rather just stay in there and starve

[1:53:20] <puddingpants88> in the book they are very graphic about ben getting mouth fucked by monster
[1:53:23] <%NovaKnightmare> Why does a Police Station have a dedicated Kennel?
[1:53:23] <startadevy> MrDestructoid
[1:53:26] <FstSergeant8595> @Legitalrep Zombies is more fun, I hate this trope now of everyone saying "infected"

[1:56:53] <+haseoseerlane> Sure hope ada is still in the RE2 remake
[1:56:54] <hazardkujacker> Ada shure loves to get on that Shaft
[1:56:55] <%NovaKnightmare> Children are weak against dogs
[1:56:57] <+Nephthyz> Does the L in L Kennedy stand for Loser?

[1:57:06] <+DGenerator> Do you save ahead of Sherry / Dogs?
[1:57:08] <DantesAnimus> Eh, still ship it
[1:57:09] <%Jpdodds> Ada is a professional
[1:57:09] <$Bonkasaurusrex> She is a super spy
[1:57:10] <$RaikenTB> Oh god, the new Sherry model will get used for SFM NotLikeThis
[1:57:11] <NiftyNox> OhMyDog nooo

[1:57:15] <dreu81> She’s better in every way
[1:57:15] <puddingpants88> clair has the worst time against the dogs from that one SFM video i saw
[1:57:16] <OkamiDude15> sherry sure can tank those dog hits like a champ
[1:57:17] <+nightwing1936> @rytisone which version is this (Actual PC. PS1, or GC)
[1:57:17] <+WhyIDie> I'd assume since it's capcom, ada also has less health
[1:57:17] <the_sprankton> are septic pools a real thing? That sounds like a breeding ground for disease
[1:57:19] <+Nomicro4u> I bet she feels better
[1:57:20] <%GameOverDeo> She has that secret agent training
[1:57:20] <Louisciphre20> Can confirm, doing Claire A right now and I hate those dogs
[1:57:23] <SuperSaiyanSora> PETA
[1:57:24] <SwiftFission> i fear for how ada will look in remake
[1:57:25] <milkforhoney> Well she has more training
[1:57:25] <+ymorn> @angriestpat can you give a rough estimate as to how many times youve honked off to RE2 Ada?
[1:57:27] <nedtheelf> Ada's great at murdering dogs
[1:57:27] <frogurtz> And shoots faster
[1:57:28] <+PhantomMaskJr> vellHound vellHound
[1:57:28] <+Devilbringer133> Women are better than men confirmed
[1:57:29] <Fujiwara_92> SHE'S A COOL LADY Kreygasm
[1:57:29] <LORDSPOOKLEKINS> @the_sprankton They are
[1:57:31] <elementofloyalty> @RaikenTB where have you been
[1:57:33] <rytisone> @nightwing1936 emulated GC
[1:57:34] <Overloard> the virgin leon vs the chad ada
[1:57:35] <IsaiahOmega> Elmo has the current speed run time
[1:57:41] <fazoburquina> @puddingpants88 Kappa
[1:57:46] <+nightwing1936> ah ok Dolphin, got it @rytisone
[1:57:47] <+haseoseerlane> Ada in re2make better be fine as hell.. don't go messing with that character model
[1:57:51] <elementofloyalty> meow
[1:57:55] <Serge_12> Ada Is A Top Spy and Leon Is A Rookie Cop
[1:57:56] <Legitalrep> is this crazy talk?
[1:57:57] <Jmann1892> Ada is a super spy and its Leon's first day
[1:57:58] <puddingpants88> @fazoburquina yoy know 😉
[1:57:59] <$RaikenTB> @elementofloyalty Everywhere and nowhere.
[1:57:59] <+arcadeking48> Is there a mod that lets you play the whole game as Ada
[1:58:00] <thelonechris> That's the first hint of "this chick is actually a super-secret agent"
[1:58:02] <$BoSteed> The FEEL of fast running
[1:58:06] <elementofloyalty> :D
[1:58:07] <+chaumiester> Leon is such a rookie, he never even had training with his gun... dun dun dun!!!
[1:58:11] <Funky_Honkey> she runs the same speed but her character model is smaller giving off the impression that she's faster. Probably
[1:58:11] <OspreySoul> With them rearranging the plots for the remake, do you think they're going to include the subplot about Sherry getting infected or is that too dark for them in 2018, on reflection?
[1:58:15] <+Mugen4552> @haseoseerlane agrees
[1:58:16] <Louisciphre20> She has a trench coat in the Remake
[1:58:17] <$RaikenTB> high res boxes Kreygasm
[1:58:19] <frogurtz> I wonder if RE2 remake's gonna show how she made it out of Raccoon City?
[1:58:21] <redeq2> Short hair aerodynamics makes her run faster
[1:58:23] <Lewin_Godwynn> Elmo is innocent
[1:58:24] <Louisciphre20> so she's Q now
[1:58:30] <buffmurffy> not really, wasnt elmo fie?
[1:58:30] <fairore> @haseoseerlane bbw ada
[1:58:30] <DraxTD> @AngriestPat how is elmo?
[1:58:32] <dreu81> Amazing
[1:58:37] <$RaikenTB> @frogurtz Darkside Chronicles did that.
[1:58:39] <+AncelDeLambert> Elmo did not do this crime, Elmo is innocent
[1:58:39] <elementofloyalty> "Ya know when you cage the beast he gets angry".
[1:58:40] <+Nomicro4u> Elmo is on parole
[1:58:44] <YO_WHADUP> Elmo was a political prisoner
[1:58:49] <+AncelDeLambert> You have skooma for Elmo, yes?
[1:58:51] <+pleasenameyourcharacter> @frogurtz she was also on the snowmobile with Snake and Meryl
[1:58:52] <%jediwatchman11> Elmo is out of the gulag
[1:58:52] <frogurtz> Yeah but they could do it again.
[1:58:58] <+Devilbringer133> @OspreySoul It's kind of important since the government uses that as leverage to recruit Leon
[1:59:01] <fireking900> Elmo was a POW
[1:59:04] <OspreySoul> Elmo gonna get a buddy?
[1:59:09] <+DGenerator> How the fuck does she get out?
[1:59:10] <elementofloyalty> CHUNK
[1:59:12] <CharileMurphyPendelton> So many of ya Ada fans played her delicious nude mod in RE6??? ;)
[1:59:14] <DrozZombie> my cat aka " old cat " says hi
[1:59:16] <OspreySoul> Well, wasn't that written out of the canon?

[2:03:05] <Ashratcliffe1992> Pat knows he's not going to die in real life, right? Kappa
[2:03:06] <AthenaAegis> Awwww damn, he cured it Kappa
[2:03:06] <YourFalloutCompanion> NOPE
[2:03:06] <Tearonex> he barely made it
[2:03:07] <Big_King_Coconut> a little poison never hurt anyone
[2:03:08] <$LocDogX86X> yes you can
[2:03:08] <+pleasenameyourcharacter> gotta go sleep, have fun Pat and chat
[2:03:08] <Thomas100273> Maybe poison runs out at Danger?
[2:03:10] <Spydurman> poison probably hurts a set amount over time
[2:03:11] <elementofloyalty> TRY IT
[2:03:12] <dreu81> You were effed
[2:03:13] <rytisone> ask Paige
[2:03:14] <+Devilbringer133> You can, I know from first hand experience
[2:03:15] <%GameOverDeo> Awww. It would have been so funny if Pat died right in front of the item box
[2:03:16] <Fujiwara_92> @angriestpat poison doesn't kill, just danger
[2:03:16] <Rada150> it probably brings you to the lowest level so enemies can one shot you
[2:03:19] <cjsugar> it's just streaming brain that make you do stupid
[2:03:20] <reonome> PATS DICK SUCKING FACE IS BACK
[2:03:22] <$FriedMattato> Maybe it's cause I only played the PS1 version, but the text on the GCN version looks super fucking weird
[2:03:28] <Big_King_Coconut> poison is a myth, it actually makes you stronger
[2:03:30] <+TheGershon> Now that was some good menuing
[2:03:32] <frogurtz> So when are Leon and Ada gonna bang guys?
[2:03:36] <elementofloyalty> :D
[2:03:36] <YourFalloutCompanion> Poison never killed anything. It did nothing wrong
[2:03:36] <DantesAnimus> I like to think that he has to snort those powders together to make them work
[2:03:38] <Overloard> 4Head just try it
[2:03:39] <captainthunderwolf> "Can you even die from poison?"
[2:03:40] <Grimsever88> U done that sacrifice shit for warframs pat?
[2:03:41] <+TheGershon> @FriedMattato It's a texture pack
[2:03:42] <cjsugar> aw that emote is adorable
[2:03:45] <CharileMurphyPendelton> no really RE2 is the Dark Souls of Resident Evil games lol trolololololo
[2:03:45] <LunarKeidran> I believe it just drops u to 1 hp eventually
[2:03:47] <@StridentSong> @AngriestPat You canoot die to poison. It wears off when Leon hits 1 HP
[2:03:50] <mr_hunter> optimal dps
[2:03:51] <dreu81> Poison is just chemicals in your head. It doesn’t actually exist.

[2:04:38] <Ashratcliffe1992> Shoot those zombies until they're dead. doodSinwata
[2:04:39] <+chaumiester> This game used to be really really scary
[2:04:43] <milkforhoney> This is going to be so scary in remake
[2:04:44] <Jpashyun> Is pat playing this on PC?
[2:04:44] <%n33t_1337> So is it gonna be weird seeing all these RE2 rooms be rendered in a 3rd person action horror game?
[2:04:45] <Overloard> leon go skraaaaa
[2:04:51] <%KittenHachiChan18> Guuhhhhhh
[2:04:51] <Legitalrep> pop pop
[2:05:01] <%jediwatchman11> i managed to run out of that room without getting bit once. I have noooo idea how
[2:05:02] <+Sum_White_Guy> @AngriestPat according to the wikia, poison will put you in danger and you can treat back up to fine but you will still take poison damage, apparently
[2:05:03] <cjsugar> @jpashyun GameCube
[2:05:12] <+Double_Perfect> @Jpashyun emulation of GC on PC
[2:05:13] <OspreySoul> @frogurtz Maybe the Ashrfords got into incestuous shenanigans?
[2:05:15] <ragasquid> that noise is from evangelion!
[2:05:17] <$radda343> the licker in the gem room always fucked me up
[2:05:18] <D4rkh34rt> SKEEBYDEEBY PAH PAH
[2:05:19] <$Smolkupo> It was scary for the time
[2:05:20] <Graxe_> Yeah, you actually can't die from poison. If you could, in the scenario where there are no more blue herbs, the game would literally be unwinnable at some point.
[2:05:21] <elementofloyalty> Elmo lost his bite
[2:05:22] <%KittenHachiChan18> Is it from Evangelion?
[2:05:23] <cjsugar> oh, my bad
[2:05:24] <Meekest> It's gonna be terrifying again soon
[2:05:26] <goddamndavid> @AngriestPat what is the scariest game you ever played?
[2:05:26] <$Smolkupo> But yeah, not it's not one bit scary
[2:05:27] <OspreySoul> Correction: They totally did.
[2:05:27] <President_valentine> RE3 was my first RE game and scared the crap out of me
[2:05:27] <Volkrotia> Before you know where to go and what to do, it can still be pretty nerve racking
[2:05:28] <AdmiralPrawn> It can still be scary today.
[2:05:30] <%fredan31> i was 11 when this came out and i couldn't sleep at night
[2:05:33] <$RaikenTB> no side pack/
[2:05:36] <%NovaKnightmare> @AngriestPat was your first survival horror experience with Resident Evil or Silent Hill?
[2:05:36] <laserbeaming> The first Licker scene scared the shit out of me when I was a kid
[2:05:36] <Tearonex> i'm glad RE2make brings back the horror
[2:05:36] <thelonechris> It can be scary if you have no idea what you are doing
[2:05:37] <ArtThouBored> Still good though
[2:05:37] <%KittenHachiChan18> Does PT still count as a game?
[2:05:43] <elementofloyalty> SLENDER
[2:05:43] <%KittenHachiChan18> Or is a something that culd have been?
[2:05:44] <OspreySoul> That's how Alfred came to be.
[2:05:45] <siliodon> it still has a pretty unnerving atmosphere mostly because of the soundtrack
[2:05:46] <+DeadlyPeaks> Sound design is still rock solid
[2:05:47] <%jediwatchman11> Silent Hill 1 still spooks me
[2:05:47] <%Agami23> ive never beaten a RE game besides 7. ive always been a big coward. but re2 hype has me wanting to play the entire series
[2:05:48] <%Jpdodds> @elementofloyalty and, well, y'know
[2:05:48] <rytisone> Dead Space
[2:05:49] <KaiserMario> 1? not 2?
[2:05:50] <battlebeast67> how many times did you beat RE2?
[2:05:52] <Rada150> what about fatal frame
[2:05:53] <+ymorn> its like how dracula and Night on Bald mountain used to be frightening
[2:05:55] <%n33t_1337> PT was more annoying to me
[2:05:56] <elementofloyalty> baby
[2:05:58] <%JaceADisgrace> PT gives me the spoopy poopy
[2:05:58] <%KittenHachiChan18> Oh man Dead Space scared the hell out of me
[2:06:00] <elementofloyalty> move cam
[2:06:00] <%fredan31> PT by and landslide

[2:06:01] <+Double_Perfect> @KittenHachiChan18 nah its just a demo
[2:06:02] <$magicalhades> baby!
[2:06:02] <Volkrotia> Alien Isolation kinda fucked with me. I played on hard
[2:06:02] <BinaryBetrayer> Silent hill 2 is more depressing than scary

[2:06:19] <milkforhoney> Keepo
[2:06:19] <Kingdommkeeper> PT FeelsBadMan
[2:06:20] <+blondie_ow> The only time the game gets scary is when you haven't saved in a while and you are in danger with no healing items in your inventory.
[2:06:22] <AdmiralPrawn> It's a shame that Dead Space was killed off as a series.
[2:06:24] <Legitalrep> TIME TO ZAP?!?!?!?!
[2:06:24] <redeq2> FORTNITE does for me WutFace
[2:06:24] <YourFalloutCompanion> Omikron definitely was the scariest
[2:06:25] <Mexrage> because, it looks very sharp =O

[2:06:28] <nedtheelf> Elmo wants to play the video game
[2:06:28] <Ashratcliffe1992> Pat. I know you've played them on the SBF's channel but have you streamed any Silent Hill games before?
[2:06:29] <+shawntk_> ELMO COLE BAYBEH
[2:06:32] <%lockbreaker> zap to the extreme
[2:06:33] <jotabranded> Eternal Darkness make me shit my pants, but today the game is a joke
[2:06:34] <Duskers> @angriestpat is the scariest game you played scarier than the scariest movie youve ever watched?
[2:06:38] <+FrostMass22> Alien Isolation was really good
[2:06:39] <SuperSaiyanSora> Meow
[2:06:39] <KaiserMario> If Konami had any decency they would make available for download again

[2:06:59] <%jediwatchman11> but Pat you need the Mugnum
[2:07:02] <elementofloyalty> Elmo flop
[2:07:02] <OrochiSheewa> the penumbra games where pretty scary
[2:07:04] <nobodyinparticular> elmo says PAY ATTENTION TO ME
[2:07:05] <OspreySoul> Alien Isolation would have been better if it had been about 30% shorter
[2:07:07] <%lockbreaker> the first time i played SH1 was on a demo disc from official playstation magazine
[2:07:09] <+Devilbringer133> @CivDung If it's like RE7 you will be able to

[2:07:32] <Huntercd> Why did Claire get stuck with children in her games?
[2:07:32] <cjsugar> I was scared playing Bioshock :/
[2:07:32] <+Ploobie> @KaiserMario Konami needs to die so that their IPs can be sold off to actual game developers, then we can get a return to form for Castlevania, Silent Hill, and Metal Gear.
[2:07:34] <IsaiahOmega> how long's he been streaming anyways
[2:07:34] <+TeethMuncher> 4Head
[2:07:35] <elementofloyalty> 4Head

[2:08:17] <Ashratcliffe1992> @ploobie Play Bloodstained if you want a new Castlevania. It's great.
[2:08:23] <+Devilbringer133> This memo it this game's version of Itchy Tasty
[2:08:27] <%TitanAura> Does Pat have a discord or is it part of a larger SBFP server?

[2:08:34] <YourFalloutCompanion> No Elmo A Skelmo B
[2:08:35] <Legitalrep> ZOMBIES
[2:08:38] <laserbeaming> Itchy tasty!
[2:08:39] <elementofloyalty> Pat purge the Discord
[2:08:39] <OspreySoul> PT was terrifying the first time I saw it, but it is still horribly unsettling, no matter how many times I watch a playthrough
[2:08:41] <+arcadeking48> The Walking Dead
[2:08:41] <%jediwatchman11> Itchy Tasty was high art and can never be replicated

[2:08:46] <%n33t_1337> @KaiserMario It'll be wiped from that too. You'll find it mysteriously broken but with no signs of entry
[2:08:47] <+SolidusRex> He literally looked like Robert Kirkman.

[2:09:18] <%Meme_Platinum> why do people write stories with characters of my name and kill them?
[2:09:22] <Grimsever88> Ill forever keep PT on my pss4
[2:09:31] <$BoSteed> Dead? Kappa
[2:09:31] <elementofloyalty> No
[2:09:43] <RedDeadRevival> @Pat, would you rather Mr.X following you around like Nemesis in RE3 or should it just be set pieces like the original?

[2:10:05] <%lockbreaker> what's the micro film do
[2:10:06] <OspreySoul> There's something about the red hallway in PT and the sounds when your camera goes all weird and disoriented
[2:10:10] <%KittenHachiChan18> @KaiserMario If he is then he's sweet
[2:10:11] <biomegabear> what version of RE2 is this?
[2:10:13] <OspreySoul> Some A+ sound design
[2:10:15] <%KittenHachiChan18> Nice
[2:10:16] <$Bonkasaurusrex> Did he get bitten by a rat then?
[2:10:17] <jayden_lee_222> its cool how most of this game is well light
[2:10:19] <AdmiralPrawn> Didn't they change the location of the press room in the remake?
[2:10:21] <elementofloyalty> PEACH
[2:10:24] <Ashratcliffe1992> If Silent Hill ever comes back I still want it to be 3rd person. Kind of tired of 1st person horror games.
[2:10:28] <%n33t_1337> @Ranger747 No. It'd be in dev hell and Kojima would demand more money for a actor that won't say much
[2:10:29] <%fredan31> it's the music

[2:12:27] <%TitanAura> The footage looks really high rez. Is this an emulation/PSN version?
[2:12:28] <Ixiah> @AngriestPat do you think your knowledge of RE2 is gonna fuck you when Remake will change details and monster placement ?
[2:12:34] <elementofloyalty> AFRO
[2:12:37] <reonome> don't touch your nose

[2:12:45] <OspreySoul> Elmo the Good Boy, settled in next to Pat, watching and admiring and being the Best Stream Cat Ever.

[2:12:59] <+Tonystarx90> Pat is the musician that made the music for this game the same musician for the gba castlevania games by any chance? the save room music sounds a lot like the cave level in Aria Of Sorrow
[2:13:01] <+haseoseerlane> man, prerendered backgrounds really hold up so well
[2:13:06] <%n33t_1337> I wonder if the old strats of RE2 will work in the Remake?
[2:13:06] <gyrogogozeppeli> this game made me master the art of imitating a zombie moan
[2:13:08] <%fredan31> funny you can hear that all the way from there

[2:13:19] <The_Swedish_X> Don't you need really high ranks for Tofu?
[2:13:21] <SwiftFission> DO TOFU
[2:13:25] <Mexrage> @n33t_1337 probably not the same way
[2:13:30] <%KittenHachiChan18> DO THE TOFU
[2:13:31] <KaiserMario> Tofu is cool, but super dumb to get... way too hard
[2:13:37] <elementofloyalty> TOFU IS THE BEST SECRET
[2:13:38] <the_sprankton> @fireking900 tofu is an unlockable character. It's literally a block of tofu
[2:13:38] <+MudoBaron> How do you feel about TOFU being confirmed for REmake 2
[2:13:38] <Grimsever88> Pats a musician?
[2:13:40] <%jediwatchman11> @n33t_1337 would not be surprised if they craft ways to fuck people over for relaying on old strats
[2:13:48] <rytisone> Leon goes WEEEEE
[2:13:50] <%JaceADisgrace> yeah, but what is TOFU
[2:13:53] <elementofloyalty> WEE

[2:14:29] <operator_san> @Grimsever88 kinda paige mentioned during one stream that he can sing
[2:14:30] <count_bob> THat's still creepy.
[2:14:30] <Mexrage> we still don't know how will lickers work, they got removed from the e3 demo, and we don't know if RE2make will throw veterans a curve ball like crimson heads were with RE1make
[2:14:30] <laserbeaming> RE loves its big creepy eyes
[2:14:31] <+Devilbringer133> @TitanAura Both 2 and 3 were ported to the gamecube

[2:16:00] <$Chimeraelite> The remake is going to be fucking INSANE
[2:16:01] <Mexrage> RE2 is the most violent RE game, not surprised how the remake is so gory so far
[2:16:02] <%WillowMelody> If what we've seen of RE2make is any indication, that shit will look nuts
[2:16:02] <YourFalloutCompanion> Ada check out this dead body. Cool huh?

[2:27:34] <+Ploobie> Capcom does a great job with announcements and releases. DMC5 and RE2 announced, and they're coming out early next year. Unlike Square Enix... they announce their games 10 years before release.

[2:39:18] <YO_WHADUP> It doesn't have to be blind
[2:39:25] <OspreySoul> That Norse Mythology book is fantastic.
[2:39:25] <+arcadeking48> That's fine. I believe there are some games you deserve to keep to yourself

[2:44:30] <ryu1299> man getting into DMC has been really hard for me as someone who got into character action with bayo. Not having two buttons is really fucking weird
[2:44:31] <The_Swedish_X> I love how most people's reactions to someone checking out DMC2 is "sorry"
[2:44:39] <Dakuu75> talking about "not having control over your party"
[2:44:42] <+Nomicro4u> Divinity 2 is not a great game to stream imho

[2:44:53] <Lewin_Godwynn> Except Billy, the DMC2 apologist
[2:44:54] <Bouldus> id agree
[2:44:59] <+king_of_beggars> Divinity sucks to watch.

[2:57:59] <Ell1ot> oh boy
[2:58:00] <AdmiralPrawn> Christ, imagine spiders in the RE2 remake.
[2:58:02] <+cavefishes> those spiders are super cute
[2:58:03] <%fredan31> bullet woond and vitals are fine...okay Capcom
[2:58:04] <tank7013> Leon's writing always just takes a massive shit in every scene involving Ada
[2:58:05] <Valask> that was NOT in the cutscene
[2:58:05] <Mr_Strut> I don't like spiders
[2:58:07] <elementofloyalty> Why the webs?
[2:58:10] <Dakuu75> WOW, look at these big-dumb sewer-tarantulas
[2:58:12] <operator_san> @AdmiralPrawn yo that shits gona be sick
[2:58:14] <chickendisasterx> @Dakuu75 that chance is like 1/1000000 so I'd say no actually. ain't worth it at all to me
[2:58:14] <Kisiel250> Leon's dong wants Ada Wong
[2:58:15] <Legitalrep> course and rough
[2:58:17] <stevatuna> the blood flowing from leons boner allowes him to completely ignore the gaping hole where his heart used to be
[2:58:17] <dreu81> I like spiders with boobs
[2:58:21] <OspreySoul> NYYYYOOOOOM
[2:58:22] <+Jackeral> those spiders freak me out
[2:58:24] <Stoike> @AngriestPat Would you say Leon is the boytoy equivalent to Ada of what Paige is to Ethan?
[2:58:24] <+khalcipher> How old is Lion in this?
[2:58:26] <+Devilbringer133> @tank7013 To be fair she is his greatest weakness
[2:58:30] <LifesNeverHumDrum> cool to see you playing this again, just rewatched the original LP the other day
[2:58:30] <CrimsonSkeletons> I would pay a million dollars for giant attack spiders.
[2:58:36] <%daminshi> One of the things I hate is they'll have spiders in Remake.
[2:58:39] <dreu81> Loen is only 14 in this
[2:58:44] <SaiyanFantasyX> I always grab the medal and use it there.
[2:58:45] <+vexicbayn> those spiders are a bad time and are not thoroughky emoiugh addresses
[2:58:48] <%khalcipher> k then
[2:58:48] <Addyoxt> which version is he playing...the ps1? this textures look way sharper
[2:58:48] <TheManFrom_Mars> Imagine those spiders in Remake
[2:58:50] <The_Swedish_X> You'd think after RE4 and by 6, Leon would have more women into him.
[2:58:53] <Dakuu75> @chickendisasterx true-enough
[2:58:54] <Laecerelius> They'll have super realistic giant spiders
[2:58:56] <CrimsonSkeletons> Ones that you can control with a lazer.
[2:58:57] <chickendisasterx> @Dakuu75 especially if it's something like las Plagas later. heeeeeelll no
[2:59:01] <+TeethMuncher> @daminshi with 4K poison!
[2:59:05] <operator_san> @LifesNeverHumDrum dude i rewatched 2 & 3 multiples
[2:59:08] <rytisone> just like Darkside Chronicles
[2:59:16] <SaiyanFantasyX> which is quite satisfying imo.
[2:59:17] <+cavefishes> pew pew
[2:59:17] <%KittenHachiChan18> MAN FUCK DARKSIDE CHRONICLES
[2:59:17] <Legitalrep> is this the Zapping System?

[2:59:20] <Valask> Do you disapprove? @AngriestPat
[2:59:27] <redeq2> OWLhighnoon
[2:59:28] <Dakuu75> @chickendisasterx ugh... I can't remember what the Plagas are/look-like atm
[2:59:29] <disister1201> That's one of the things that gets me about this game is that it was the rats that spread the virus and not ONE OF THE FUCKING DOGS IN THE FOREST
[2:59:34] <YourFalloutCompanion> Not as good as RE4 shooting gallery, hehe jk
[2:59:34] <elementofloyalty> CHOMP
[2:59:34] <stevatuna> leons 14 and also a former special forces green beret like Chris who is 16

[2:59:42] <Valask> oh jesus chris
[2:59:42] <$RaikenTB> I hope the remake is harder.
[2:59:42] <tank7013> @Devilbringer133 That's kinda partially what I mean though. Why does he want to bone a chick that literally left him for dead and constantly hinders him?
[2:59:43] <Fujiwara_92> ADA WAIT!

[3:00:34] <@JustinianKnight> That gator dead
[3:00:35] <fattness132> re2 remake version of the gator should be interesting
[3:00:35] <+Grayhammatter> poor big guy
[3:00:35] <Hayato182004> It should've been a street shark. It would've been more hype if it was a street shark.
[3:00:38] <+TeethMuncher> Croc lives matter
[3:00:38] <Dakuu75> @chickendisasterx oh, one of those type-a-things. ew, yeah, no-thanks to that.
[3:00:42] <marsano168> The Croc was unarmed!

[3:01:07] <$Piemono> Going into the sewer with a bullet wound must be instant death
[3:01:08] <rytisone> this theme reminds me of revelations main theme
[3:01:10] <+fistorage> Ada's theme Kreygasm
[3:01:10] <YourFalloutCompanion> Perfect
[3:01:10] <%Jpdodds> What a man
[3:01:10] <disister1201> Fun Fact the game heals you here for free
[3:01:11] <%ThatGuyfromMars> uhhh
[3:01:11] <Overloard> WHAT A CHAMP
[3:01:12] <Janzer247> yeah you just shove them in the hole
[3:01:12] <RutilusMonachus> Asprin is the best cure to bullet wounds
[3:01:13] <+zedreamcast> I gotta admit that I actually used your LP as a walkthrough for this game when i first played it Pat
[3:01:14] <+Nomicro4u> well I mean they where EXTRA STRENGTH
[3:01:15] <DantesAnimus> Proof that Leon's a beast
[3:01:15] <+TeethMuncher> That's why they're extra strength
[3:01:15] <Valask> WHAT
[3:01:16] <fattness132> explains why leon is so fucking strong in RE4
[3:01:17] <Rngiddion> Man those novels were such wonderful trash
[3:01:22] <Fruitywhompus> the aspirin stops the blood
[3:01:22] <%Jpdodds> My boyfriends dead. Lets fuck!
[3:01:25] <yosukecchi> ada put some tampons in there to stop the bleeding
[3:01:25] <elementofloyalty> John's Dead...never mind
[3:01:26] <clonexsniperx> aspirins made of the green herbs?
[3:01:26] <OspreySoul> "I'm so emotional. Can't you tell?"
[3:01:27] <milkforhoney> We in boys
[3:01:27] <fazoburquina> the clothes really needed the patching up
[3:01:27] <Ell1ot> he doesnt smoke some herbs?
[3:01:28] <Legitalrep> love ended with John, Leon is my new best bone
[3:01:29] <Prism_Wing> @redeq2 Aaah Real Monsters
[3:01:31] <%radda343> SD Perry doesn't know how guns work
[3:01:35] <Mr_Strut> Wouldn't aspirin be terrible for a gunshot because it makes it harder to clot.
[3:01:35] <+tuesti> Leon was like Hell Yeah He's Dead
[3:01:37] <+Krivvan> Trust me, I went to med school, Aspirin definitely just stops bleeding
[3:01:37] <bendatron> hold on is leon in full kevlar on his upper body or is his shirt fucking massive
[3:01:38] <Fruitywhompus> @leon get in there my son
[3:01:39] <Wistelligence> i love in older games where their feet skate around when they shift in animations
[3:01:39] <+Buytoast> 2 assprins would probably overdose him
[3:01:40] <Valask> @Jpdodds at least... they waited?
[3:01:41] <goddamndavid> it was a flesh wound man
[3:01:44] <alextrebeken> this isnt Mario Golf!
[3:01:48] <OspreySoul> Leon's like, "Welp, now that your boyfriend's dead..."
[3:01:48] <jinking79> It his first Day
[3:01:50] <+Kairi__> WHAT A BAD ASS 😍
[3:01:51] <Overloard> Leon more bad ass than chris
[3:01:51] <dreu81> He’s 14. Full of vigor.
[3:01:52] <+TeethMuncher> He's still hungover enough to shrug off bullets
[3:01:57] <jj_cabo> Tis but a scratch
[3:01:58] <CrimsonSkeletons> That is an invitation if i ever heard one.
[3:02:01] <$BoSteed> Anyone with that hair cut HAS to be a badass. Kappa
[3:02:02] <elementofloyalty> std
[3:02:03] <Aleate> It must be the same asprin that Ms Burkin was going to get LUL
[3:02:04] <LabTech41> I love how in those novels, there's a running subplot of some shadowy guy that works for Umbrella, but is helping the good guys to destroy Umbrella from the inside, and I don't think that subplot ever went anywhere
[3:02:06] <rytisone> he is in pain, but ADA
[3:02:06] <Blazeofflame> Itchy Tasty
[3:02:12] <Valask> @AngriestPat Do you feel like gun wounds haven't killed anyone in this fucking series?
[3:02:13] <grayjammer> "Hey buddy. Are you hot?"
[3:02:16] <+SirOinkens> danW
[3:02:27] <Valask> Dan has the best emotes

[3:02:32] <elementofloyalty> ???
[3:02:34] <KaiserRolled> D:
[3:02:34] <Happy_Karl> I mean look what he becomes in the later games, You don't get like that be being a giant pansy.
[3:02:36] <+arcadeking48> Guns are really only effective on zombies
[3:02:37] <Dakuu75> I've never been shot before... but, I imagine you'd need nothing short of 60mg of Oxy to even BEGIN to approach the ability to ignore that kind of pain, right? (anyone here ever been shot before?)
[3:02:44] <$Piemono> Raccoon City must have a shitty IA department
[3:02:45] <KaiserRolled> To think taxidermy used to be my hobby FeelsBadMan
[3:02:50] <OspreySoul> Between Irons and Birkin, the remake is gonna be DARK.
[3:02:52] <Legitalrep> especially against living things
[3:02:57] <%Jpdodds> My friend once pulled a knife on me over D&D
[3:03:00] <Ell1ot> how long is the gap between RE1 and RE2?
[3:03:00] <$ookiiapple> @Valask only in the cutscenes
[3:03:01] <Valask> @KaiserRolled what the fuck man
[3:03:01] <+AncelDeLambert> That's a bit more than not amused
[3:03:10] <+cavefishes> @Jpdodds "friend"
[3:03:13] <+brave_sj> I feel like the game drastically underestimates the consequences for just pulling a gun on soomeone
[3:03:18] <YourFalloutCompanion> @jpdodds UUUH
[3:03:28] <+zedreamcast> How many times have you beaten this game Pat?
[3:03:38] <The_Swedish_X> NOW is when it gets weird?
[3:03:38] <CrimsonSkeletons> Use those Loot Box Coins.
[3:03:40] <Valask> @Jpdodds was it over a +1 item
[3:03:44] <+Grayhammatter> why are they gone though?
[3:03:46] <+cavefishes> @zedreamcast this is the first time he's ever played it
[3:03:48] <Dakuu75> @zedreamcast I'd guess, a solid 6 at least.
[3:03:50] <ObsidianDragon86> Awww fuck now! how late am I?
[3:03:56] <AdmiralPrawn> @Ell1ot RE1 is July 24th, RE2 is September 29th.

[3:04:17] <$Smolkupo> Only 11 or 12
[3:04:17] <+brave_sj> The spiders aren't gone though Kappa
[3:04:18] <%Floafer> Is this the game youve beat more than any other?
[3:04:19] <+SolidusRex> @Jpdodds Having played some DnD myself, I can imagine a good number of scenarios that could've led to that.
[3:04:19] <Hunk_Of_Dunk> Does that count the times you beat it in your head?
[3:04:20] <Itchytasty_> carciSpooder
[3:04:21] <+a_turnt_egg> the spiders and alligator are dumb shit
[3:04:24] <%Floafer> Ive beat re4 like 9 times by now
[3:04:25] <$ookiiapple> @ObsidianDragon86 4 hours
[3:04:27] <%Jpdodds> @cavefishes @YourFalloutCompanion @Valask It was a tense, but its cool I guess. It was over an argument about character alignment

[3:04:51] <AdmiralPrawn> Was Raccoon City kind of okay back during RE1?
[3:04:54] <+zedreamcast> I beat this game for the first time last year
[3:04:55] <Valask> @Jpdodds You mean the worst part of DnD?

[3:05:21] <DemonicCipher> @AngriestPat to be fair Leon has consumed and injected like 20 green "herbs" so he could be REALLY high right now to shrug off the bullets.

[3:06:33] <+AncelDeLambert> the logo's an octogon, isn't it?
[3:06:34] <+zedreamcast> Is this the gamecube version of the game?

[3:06:40] <AdmiralPrawn> You visit here in RE0.
[3:06:40] <fazoburquina> man, the guns the umbrella goons had must have been ultra weak if a few shotgun shells are enough to drive off monster birkin
[3:06:46] <OspreySoul> @ookiiapple I love it. My Lv 10 monk is a blast to play
[3:06:48] <rytisone> get that shotgun upgrade

[3:08:51] <Valask> @OspreySoul Who? Your GM or Gary?
[3:09:00] <%WillowMelody> @Thorn14 It's only the bites that the story says infect you.
[3:09:02] <OspreySoul> @Valask Gary, I meant
[3:09:07] <elementofloyalty> WTF
[3:09:11] <+Thorn14> Thought so Willow, thanks
[3:09:13] <YourFalloutCompanion> I HAVE THIS
[3:09:13] <Valask> Gary Gygax always minds
[3:09:15] <rytisone> saved
[3:09:17] <Valask> he minds everything
[3:09:18] <disister1201> Shouldn't of reloaded applying the upgrade gives you full ammo
[3:09:22] <LabTech41> @Thorn14 coming from a biologist's perspective, the rules for all these bio-weapons make NO SENSE. There's no consistency, and it's all based on what the plot needs it to be.

[3:09:50] <rytisone> no, you wouldnt
[3:10:00] <The_Swedish_X> Who carries around just the parts?
[3:10:00] <+Thorn14> I"d be fine with "Leon is one of the lucky ones immune" or something
[3:10:01] <Grimsever88> Plot iframes
[3:10:02] <$ookiiapple> @OspreySoul have any of your characters kicked the bucket?
[3:10:04] <Valask> @OspreySoul I like my characters to suffer, so dying is sad in a different way

[3:13:43] <AdmiralPrawn> Did you know that initially the G-virus was intended to make genetically perfect superhumans, and that the reason it turned Birkin into a mutant was because it was still unfinished. Birkin had the same plan as Spencer and Wesker, to make a race of superhumans.

[3:15:10] <+LastHazzerd> Mags are metal containers that hold multiple bullets, a clip is a thin strip of metal that holds maybe 5 or 6

[3:15:35] <OspreySoul> @ookiiapple We fought one of those awhile back! It was fun! We also got our asses collectively smacked by a trio of mindflayers.
[3:15:35] <Valask> LEON SHOOT HER

[3:15:56] <Marpolo13> excuse me as I heal myself with my MANY healing items Ada.
[3:15:57] <$ookiiapple> @OspreySoul mind flayers? holy crap

[3:16:01] <rytisone> save, those rooms can be tricky
[3:16:02] <+130nu> hi
[3:16:03] <+LastHazzerd> the most sexless sexual tension in a series, i love it
[3:16:08] <redeq2> I need healing
[3:16:12] <+TeethMuncher> @DarkOnyx7 but you can clip a magazine, no?
[3:16:12] <$nademonkey1100> i wish it was still called the Mugnum
[3:16:14] <ltthunderbolt> safe room music ResidentSleeper ResidentSleeper
[3:16:16] <%Jpdodds> It was just a cover, but still, "John" just died like 15 minutes agp
[3:16:18] <chickendisasterx> Resident Evil: where everyone wants to smash but never smash
[3:16:24] <elementofloyalty> 4Head
[3:16:26] <+TheDarkenedRose> I can't wait for these interactions in the RE2 Remake. They'll definitely be a lot more fleshed out than in this version.
[3:16:33] <chickendisasterx> except for Barry apparently
[3:16:34] <Zombrocom> So how many years have Ada and Leon been doing this will they wont they thing. Like 20?
[3:16:42] <%fredan31> %66 done?
[3:16:44] <AdmiralPrawn> John was just some poor fool that Ada was using to get close to Umbrella's secrets.
[3:16:45] <$ookiiapple> well m out
[3:16:45] <disister1201> This game is hella easy but apparently there are some versions with a hard mode
[3:16:51] <President_valentine> Even when they get the go ahead like with Ashley
[3:16:52] <Mexrage> @TheDarkenedRose the interaction with marvin are really far more fleshed out
[3:16:55] <salmonrowboat> she should just take your healing items in remake
[3:16:55] <+TeethMuncher> @Zombrocom they're on break
[3:16:57] <%fredan31> more like 75%
[3:17:00] <OspreySoul> @ookiiapple Yeah, we were all sweating. Our cleric went down at one point, and I think my monk was the only one up and moving for a few rounds. Basically just hitting them with stunning strike and disengaging and praying.
[3:17:03] <+TheDarkenedRose> Hell yeah it was. I loved it @Mexrage
[3:17:08] <elementofloyalty> Mr Freeze
[3:17:09] <+spiegspikel> The amount of times Ada pulls/says some shady shit only for Leon to barely even acknowledge it is baffling.
[3:17:18] <$RaikenTB> Claire can just use a flame round.
[3:17:28] <Dakuu75> @chickendisasterx is the RE universe sort-of like the Walking Dead universe in the snese that. EVERYONE is infected with some form of the virus and soon as you die, the virus takes over?
[3:17:28] <%RubberFistFight> Never? Forever never? Forever ever?
[3:17:30] <ChiefSombrero> I’m not sure what game but the three herb mix does provide temporary immunity to all damage
[3:17:32] <Justin_the_Lion> @AngriestPat , isn't RE3 before RE2?
[3:17:35] <+Ultimatefool> Don't First aids kill your rank in the classic ones?
[3:17:35] <Heartless_01> i love this animation
[3:17:39] <rytisone> spray it on your butt
[3:17:39] <yosukecchi> eat? like spray them in your mouth like throat spray?
[3:17:39] <%Floafer> Pat youve literally never used a first aid spray in any LP ive seen you do of this game
[3:17:41] <CrimsonSkeletons> "What killed the dinosaurs? The ICE age!"
[3:17:44] <elementofloyalty> cover yer eyes
[3:17:46] <%RubberFistFight> I AM ROOBIT ARM

[3:17:51] <+TeethMuncher> @RubberFistFight never, forever
[3:17:52] <AdmiralPrawn> I'm currently in the process of doing a no damage run through RE0.
[3:17:53] <LifesNeverHumDrum> nooooo save all ur flame rounds, and then never us them
[3:17:56] <+akibared126> hell yeah
[3:17:56] <Blazeofflame> ASMR right here
[3:17:58] <+Ml33tninja> Just getting in can’t remember if this is part a or b
[3:18:00] <+arcadeking48> This is incredibly well done.
[3:18:03] <+SolidusRex> I not only love the animation, and the sound design for it.
[3:18:04] <goddamndavid> oh man its clipping so hard in itself
[3:18:05] <$nademonkey1100> also leon and ada have been doing this for around 14 years
[3:18:09] <elementofloyalty> TYPE - P
[3:18:13] <+arcadeking48> Like, theres a bizarre amount of love and detail in that robot arm?
[3:18:14] <+Ploobie> I hope they remake RE3 as well.
[3:18:18] <Thalchampz> this is Leon A
[3:18:19] <disister1201> No RE you are either infected or your not and it can be cured
[3:18:20] <Dakuu75> looks like the exact same thing from Jurassic Park when the fat guy is stealing the DNA or the robot-arm is rotating the raptor eggs
[3:18:20] <the_sprankton> how expensive are these fuses that they need to be inserted by machines?
[3:18:21] <Justin_the_Lion> @AngriestPat While she's in the chapel?
[3:18:22] <elementofloyalty> plants
[3:18:23] <+Devilbringer133> The plant monsters
[3:18:25] <+LastHazzerd> Then RE4 is later, dunno where 5 is tho
[3:18:26] <+zedreamcast> How long does RE2 take? Like in terms of how long in the actual game story
[3:18:30] <+Ml33tninja> Cool
[3:18:30] <+SolidusRex> Ivys
[3:18:38] <chickendisasterx> @Dakuu75 no, you need direct infection for everything. and you don't need to be dead for them to take effect
[3:18:38] <Mexrage> like, RE3 is almost like a expansion to RE2, they could also make it a DLC expansion to RE2make
[3:18:39] <ltthunderbolt> why isn't Leon's hair blonde?
[3:18:39] <Ser_Randal> Old man Pat smokes too much crack
[3:18:41] <elementofloyalty> 4
[3:18:44] <%forester13> Just finished the LeonA/ClaireB playthrough for the first time and seeing Pat blaze through parts of the game that took me weeks to finish is a little embarrassing
[3:18:49] <+Devilbringer133> They are only in this section of the game
[3:18:57] <rytisone> Poison Ivy's...holy hell, Batman
[3:18:58] <$RaikenTB> long range like acid rounds though.
[3:19:01] <SwiftFission> R3MAKE will probably happen, if this sells well. Which I am sure it will.
[3:19:05] <YourFalloutCompanion> The Hunk ivys though
[3:19:07] <+fistorage> yeah, they stuck a bunch of weird enemies in the tail end of the game
[3:19:07] <elementofloyalty> HENTAI TENTICLES
[3:19:10] <CrimsonSkeletons> I love that music when Dennis Nedry was stealing dino dna.
[3:19:19] <%commanderclaw> @AngriestPat You think Crimson Heads are coming back?
[3:19:22] <+Ml33tninja> I would kill for re3make nemesis
[3:19:22] <$Chimeraelite> This is what it looks like when you watch someone who loves a game casually play through it
[3:19:24] <+arcadeking48> TENTAI HENTACLES
[3:19:24] <Jordan_z123> !uptime
[3:19:24] <$nademonkey1100> wait does it make your rank go down?!
[3:19:24] <@Moobot> I've been playing this game for how long? Oh only 3h 19m 33s.
[3:19:26] <+AmaniIsYourBoss> It does? Never knew that
[3:19:29] <LabTech41> Remember how the T-virus used to infect plants? what happened to that in later games?
[3:19:31] <ValHollaYoloson> i recall them being decent against birkin
[3:19:33] <+Devilbringer133> Guest limit of 24 hours is nuts
[3:19:35] <AdmiralPrawn> No-one ever used the flamethrower.
[3:19:38] <Squdnate> @AngriestPat A guy just posted on the smash subreddit about experiencing that smash players smell a tong, again.
[3:19:39] <ChiefSombrero> Nope it doesn’t
[3:19:40] <TheManFrom_Mars> Kinda sucks you cant use the flamethrower
[3:19:40] <%Agami23> damn, bitchslapped you.
[3:19:41] <+Ml33tninja> YES please have crimson heads
[3:19:42] <AdmiralPrawn> The flamethrower was the mine thrower of RE2.
[3:19:44] <elementofloyalty> an his hair looks great
[3:19:44] <Sonexay> Password is AKUMA
[3:19:44] <Huntercd> How does Claire even know how to use a grenade launche
[3:19:46] <%polaroidjackson> i'm interested to see what direction RE8 takes
[3:19:49] <grayjammer> Crawl into the Flailing Vinehole
[3:19:52] <KaiserRolled> I remember MingLee
[3:19:52] <OspreySoul> HAHAHHA I REMEMBER THIS
[3:19:55] <+brave_sj> @LabTech41 Don't think about it too hard
[3:19:57] <Dakuu75> those were lickers?
[3:19:59] <+arcadeking48> Holy shit
[3:20:00] <YourFalloutCompanion> Perfect
[3:20:00] <$Chimeraelite> jesus
[3:20:03] <rytisone> ahh, smucks
[3:20:04] <Mexrage> more shotgun!
[3:20:04] <ltthunderbolt> 3 years ago
[3:20:05] <%RubberFistFight> they were clearly Saibamen
[3:20:06] <DantesAnimus> lookit that ceiling vagina
[3:20:09] <%knomad2b> soooo many shells
[3:20:13] <goddamndavid> that was the best part of that lp
[3:20:14] <%RubberFistFight> Nappa and Vegeta are just outside the door
[3:20:17] <Ser_Randal> Man I was hoping for you to die again tbh
[3:20:21] <$Chimeraelite> OH SO THAT'S WHY
[3:20:26] <+AXL808> Pat just calmly blowing away monsters without a thought
[3:20:28] <elementofloyalty> 2
[3:20:32] <+akibared126> THE LORE
[3:20:33] <+zedreamcast> How come you don't wear headphones? Don't you get any sort of echo?
[3:20:45] <DagetSparrow> lewd
[3:20:47] <VikingEagle> @AngriestPat What are your hopes/predictions for RE8 whenever that happens? Or do questions require crack money for answers?
[3:20:49] <rytisone> Leon: the cum dumpeter
[3:20:49] <%TitanAura> Huh yeah...
[3:20:54] <OspreySoul> Dont they still attack if you don't burn them?
[3:20:56] <elementofloyalty> 1 more
[3:20:58] <LabTech41> @brave_sj I don't, it's just part of the inconsistency that the virus used to infect everything and turn it into monsters, but after like 2 it was just humans and sometimes dogs, unless it was a specific experiment that made them.
[3:21:00] <+Ml33tninja> Running past the monsters in the first section helps a tons here
[3:21:05] <Dakuu75> @AXL808 better than listening to him bitch'n moan about fucking it up and re-loading saves a billion timtes, right?
[3:21:10] <+arcadeking48> @AngriestPat I love how the shotgun is so strong, you see it nearly fly out of Leon's hands from the recoil
[3:21:10] <The_Swedish_X> god, you can really see the kickback when he shoots
[3:21:12] <AdmiralPrawn> Imagine ivies in the remake.
[3:21:15] <SaiyanFantasyX> what is that mic?
[3:21:19] <%lockbreaker> leon's little ken doll body nearly flew across the screen from the kickback on that gun
[3:21:30] <Huntercd> Why isn't Leon holding that shotgun in his shoulder?
[3:21:30] <+Huderga> night people i got work in the morning but the stream was fun
[3:21:31] <$Chimeraelite> looks like a vagina tree
[3:21:32] <ELuscious> that is that red sandball
[3:21:32] <+SolidusRex> I love how fucking loud the upgraded shotgun is. Shit used to blast the fuck out of my speakers back in the day.
[3:21:33] <elementofloyalty> DAK mic?
[3:21:35] <Zael913> Outbreak was so much fun
[3:21:37] <+TheDarkenedRose> Below Freezing Point?
[3:21:38] <%Agami23> lookit those creepy plant vaginas.
[3:21:39] <%MisterCrimson> Yoglol?
[3:21:40] <chickendisasterx> >Virus increases cell regen >somehow gives plants sentience
[3:21:43] <+brave_sj> You know Leon that recoil might be a little more manageable if you used the fucking shoulder stock and shot the gun the way you're supposed to as a trained police officer
[3:21:43] <+Ml33tninja> Some of the creatures in Remake were horrific if you read how some of them were made
[3:21:43] <+NightOwlSam> so wait, the headphones are for pat to hear the tv or the feedback from hs mic?
[3:21:45] <gyrogogozeppeli> any chance of an Outbreak LP?
[3:21:48] <rytisone> It is not primary antagonist, but its there
[3:21:48] <+spiegspikel> I am not at all looking forward to seeing the spiders in the remake.
[3:21:52] <goddamndavid> When is the Outbreak remake gonna come?
[3:21:52] <%RubberFistFight> @zedreamcast if you have a directional mic and your main volume is low enough, then the mic won't pick it up. I play with no headphones on my stream and the speakers are less than a meter away, and with the mic on "cardioid" with the gain at the lowest setting, sitting 4 inches from my mouth, the speakers may well as not exist to the mic.
[3:21:59] <%NigelSchnauzerpug> Is Pat going to be streaming til 3 am again?
[3:22:00] <Heartless_01> LUL
[3:22:02] <ChiefSombrero> It’s funny cause in the Extreme Battle Mode when Chris uses the improved shotgun, no recoil
[3:22:02] <+Devilbringer133> Did it run away?
[3:22:08] <SaiyanFantasyX> anyone know which mic is that?
[3:22:08] <+Ultimatefool> I don't remember the lickers being green? Or is it just the ones in the lab

[3:22:23] <+TheDarkenedRose> He uses an AT2020 from Audio Technica @SaiyanFantasyX
[3:22:25] <StooEsq> I appreciate DMC's shotgun having the same sound as the C. Shotgun from RE2
[3:22:27] <%Slaardacity> just caught up on the Detroit lp, holy shit man
[3:22:34] <YourFalloutCompanion> So when you streaming all of Outbreak?
[3:22:36] <+zedreamcast> Huh I should look into that for my stream, maybe that'd be nice
[3:22:39] <+TheDarkenedRose> Or is it an AT 2035?

[3:23:02] <$RaikenTB> did you see the PC specs for REmake 2?
[3:23:08] <+zedreamcast> I use a Snoball mic so i think that maybe might work?
[3:23:09] <ELuscious> why is woolie so bad at games?

[3:23:41] <%fredan31> @ELuscious it's hard for some people to talk and play at the same time
[3:23:42] <+SolidusRex> Woolie is bad at games because he talks shit about the zapping system.

[3:24:22] <AdmiralPrawn> That lab is where Birkin injected himself with the G-virus.
[3:24:23] <+Kravedarknesss> The shotgun in the remake is gloriously gory
[3:24:29] <+rangriz> man I forgot how easy RE2 is during the second half of the game with all the ammo you got, hope they change that in Remake2
[3:24:31] <+zaibatsu_member_333> Pat? onlyafroHello

[3:25:24] <StrawberryPantsu> AKUMA
[3:25:29] <Prism_Wing> That was a boss? lol
[3:25:32] <+zedreamcast> Thats a nice sound effect
[3:25:32] <StrawberryPantsu> A K U M A
[3:25:34] <+sinistersally> AKUMA
[3:25:37] <+redstonej> that monster was kind of adorable
[3:25:37] <Dakuu75> moths using an old CRT monitor for warmth... canon
[3:25:41] <gryffinp> What a secure fucking system.
[3:25:43] <rytisone> Leon is like:"I dont understand" then shoots computer
[3:25:44] <Androcecy> What are the chances of us ever getting a complete remaster (or remake) of the original silent hills?
[3:25:45] <+spiegspikel> Gouki
[3:25:46] <+zedreamcast> Pat are you gonna do Akuma mode?
[3:25:46] <VandalCulture> Is this Pat's best look? Or does he look better Dad of War style, shaved head and beard?
[3:25:48] <%RubberFistFight> @zedreamcast A snowball isn't a bad mic by any stretch of the imagination, but it is very basic. But as long as you have it close to your face, with the gain all the way down, set to only pick up infront of it, it'll do just fine without headphones. Bonus points if you put it on an arm with a shockmount - that way it won't pick up low-frequency vibrations from your desk or house.
[3:25:59] <+Ilpala271> It lets you use guest? Christ, that is just babytown frolics
[3:26:04] <+SolidusRex> It was a mini-boss.
[3:26:07] <fireking900> mini boss
[3:26:14] <+WhyIDie> username: admin, password:admin
[3:26:16] <elementofloyalty> Elmo is a better boss
[3:26:17] <Mexrage> more like a one time only enemy
[3:26:20] <%WillowMelody> @Androcecy fucking .1%, dude. Don't get your hopes up. Remaster is actually 0, since they threw away all the silent hill files every time.
[3:26:24] <+arcadeking48> "mini" in the sense that it wasn't around for very long
[3:26:27] <Zael913> That computer system has really poor security if you can just gain access by putting yourself in as a "GUEST"
[3:26:28] <+zedreamcast> I'll definitely try to use that tech thanks @RubberFistFight
[3:26:31] <+zaibatsu_member_333> it was mini just like PAT :D
[3:26:32] <JZPotter> @RubberFistFight I will say if you can spend some extra money, go straight to a Blue Yeti
[3:26:38] <elementofloyalty> part two
[3:26:45] <+NightOwlSam> @RubberFistFight thanks for all the helpful info
[3:26:53] <Huntercd> Umbrella is bad at security passwords
[3:27:01] <%RubberFistFight> @JZPotter that's what i've got, yeah. On an arm with a cheap shockmount but it does the trick.
[3:27:01] <$nademonkey1100> now all he is thinking buckshot
[3:27:03] <Androcecy> Damn, Resident Evil 2 looks dank as hell. It would be cool to see the first Silent Hill in a modern engine.
[3:27:06] <CrimsonSkeletons> If one needs to isolate sound from their hd tv, use a digital optic converter to audio output for headphone jack. It's old tech, and may cost a pretty nickel but it works.
[3:27:13] <+zedreamcast> Pat I remember once you mentioned that when you worked you would play mental RE2, how exactly does that work?
[3:27:18] <elementofloyalty> 4th one
[3:27:21] <Zael913> I mean, a lot of Umbrella's fuck ups could be solved by better security
[3:27:24] <+McLellanJ> ill miss these doors
[3:27:30] <%RubberFistFight> @NightOwlSam no problem man. Getting into streaming/recording can be daunting at first if you're not familiar with audio gear, even on a basic level.
[3:27:32] <+HCF249> just tuned in, first thing i see isthe licker jumping out n pat calmly going "fuck off"
[3:27:35] <$Chimeraelite> I zigged when I shoulda zagged
[3:27:38] <+zaibatsu_member_333> mhmmm mental RE2
[3:27:41] <%fredan31> those thing have a awesome kill animation
[3:27:45] <rytisone> lewd hentai plant got you
[3:27:50] <Sielas> is any RE game outside the main series any good? @angriestpat
[3:27:55] <+AncelDeLambert> THE HYPEST GAMEPLAY ON TWITCH!
[3:28:03] <+WhyIDie> it's like shadowboxing, but you're playing RE2
[3:28:03] <+NightOwlSam> @RubberFistFight that's what i hope to achieve, still trying to learn the tech aspect of it
[3:28:06] <+akibared126> Is Pat going to do Claire B?
[3:28:06] <Mexrage> why spend on better security, when you can just spend that money on building a giant aquarium for sharks in the middle of nowhere! @Zael913
[3:28:06] <$Chimeraelite> This gives me warm fuzzies
[3:28:12] <goddamndavid> You're theorycrafting RE2 runs
[3:28:13] <Thalchampz> mental training
[3:28:17] <+DrBunn> in the mind palace
[3:28:19] <+zedreamcast> Thats crazy to remember every single thing
[3:28:20] <JZPotter> @RubberFistFight It was my second mic when I first began trying to be a voice actor. Now I'm using a CAD GXL3000. In between going to an actual studio trying to build up to an agent.
[3:28:21] <%RubberFistFight> PAT'S MIND PALACE CONFIRMED
[3:28:22] <AdmiralPrawn> The RE2 mind palace
[3:28:23] <%AbnormalVoid> that is incredibly depressing, since I've done something similar
[3:28:26] <%fredan31> i used to do that with the zelda games
[3:28:28] <elementofloyalty> scrubs
[3:28:29] <Androcecy> That's what a crazy person would say basically.
[3:28:30] <thelonechris> Inb4 Pat fucks up
[3:28:30] <goddamndavid> THE MINDSCAPE
[3:28:32] <+SolidusRex> I used to do mental playthroughs of Spyro 1 at work.
[3:28:33] <Zael913> @Mexrage Cuz giant sharks are cool!
[3:28:34] <+McLellanJ> @AngriestPat are you playing mental RE2 right now while you play real RE2?
[3:28:35] <+HCF249> its all in the mind Harry
[3:28:38] <Bouldus> get fucked zombles
[3:28:39] <%AbnormalVoid> god, retail is the worst NotLikeThis
[3:28:44] <the_sprankton> Pat's mind palace is the Spencer Estate
[3:28:46] <%badmr7> Still streaming awesome !
[3:28:46] <Ser_Randal> That’s really depressing Pat I’m glad you don’t work retail anymore
[3:28:51] <nobodyinparticular> TRIPLE KILL
[3:28:51] <Mrthepastyrider> Pat must have been really god damned bored to do that.
[3:28:53] <rytisone> Moe disk
[3:28:54] <$Chimeraelite> That's me and captain claw. Can't play it cause Win10 FUCKED ME and compatability mode doesn't even work BibleThump
[3:28:54] <+Ml33tninja> Ive done that kind of mental training for Demons Souls runs
[3:28:54] <AdmiralPrawn> There's always a MO disk.
[3:28:57] <DePhat1> that one unlucky sod
[3:28:58] <+zaibatsu_member_333> why'd ja havta do it to 'em Pat?
[3:28:59] <elementofloyalty> HI BABE
[3:29:04] <%AbnormalVoid> YOU
[3:29:05] <goddamndavid> SHOOT HER
[3:29:08] <%fredan31> she should be dead
[3:29:08] <HayabusaTaichou> Anyone who hasn't started going through a game's loop while unable to play it is a liar.
[3:29:08] <+NightOwlSam> Pat's Mind Mansion
[3:29:08] <%commanderclaw> Yeyeye, the pipes!
[3:29:09] <Mexrage> @Zael913 sadly, they didn't paid for extra security for the giant fish tank, and it broke
[3:29:17] <elementofloyalty> Y YER PANTS SO HIGH GIRL?
[3:29:17] <ragasquid> what a cunt
[3:29:18] <+Devilbringer133> That's how I play old RE games like this, it really rewards planning ahead
[3:29:20] <grizzlywhisker> i wonder if the remake will add any new characters
[3:29:20] <fireking900> @AngriestPat has you tried playin RE2 with ur eyes close?
[3:29:22] <%RubberFistFight> @JZPotter what i'd really like is something like what Pat has, or even a blue Spark, through a mixer, but I gotta wait for the Twitchbux to start rolling in first. But for right now the Yeti is totally great.
[3:29:22] <chickendisasterx> His legacy SUCKS
[3:29:24] <gyrogogozeppeli> LEON U DUMB
[3:29:31] <Janzer247> HAHAHA
[3:29:32] <AdmiralPrawn> @AngriestPat I can't wait to see Annette in the remake.
[3:29:34] <+Cigwynn> "You came for the T-Virus, DIDN'T YOU!" "....What?"
[3:29:34] <+redstonej> DANCING
[3:29:36] <$rdark_ksu> oh eat ass you old gash
[3:29:38] <roboguy2k> @AngriestPat You used to work at a grocery store right? What do you think of people who bring reusable bags and expect you to bag them?
[3:29:38] <+tuesti> LEON YOU DUMBASS
[3:29:40] <Heartless_01> love the hand movements
[3:29:41] <+zedreamcast> I like how Leon is just kind of here confused, not being involved in anything
[3:29:42] <Thalchampz> good old ps1 hand gestures
[3:29:42] <Zael913> @Mexrage oroThump
[3:29:43] <CrimsonSkeletons> Hi Inflammo Mammoth, i liked you in Mega Man X.
[3:29:43] <Jarvanii> I want her to kick her leg up too randomly
[3:29:44] <Prism_Wing> @chimeraelite Captain Claw? Is that that game about the pirate cat???

[3:29:51] <+spiegspikel> Oscar-winning writing.
[3:29:51] <%samantha_ah> @AngriestPat Your description of Mental RE2 reminds me that I used to do similar for EarthBound when I worked retail. It was anything to escape the drudgery.
[3:29:52] <goddamndavid> It is pretty funny since Leon and Claire are literally bumble-kinging their way into this conspiracy
[3:29:53] <gyrogogozeppeli> no u dont
[3:29:53] <stranger59> I love that Leon honestly has little to no idea what is going on.
[3:29:53] <rytisone> must protecc Ada
[3:29:55] <Androcecy> It's ridiculous as hell!
[3:29:55] <yosukecchi> how can this BE??

[3:29:59] <+arcadeking48> Anyone ever play Koudelka?
[3:30:00] <OspreySoul> Is Laura Bailey voicing her in the remake? It sounded like it in the trailer.
[3:30:02] <$Chimeraelite> First platrformer I ever played and IT IS STILL THE BEST
[3:30:03] <%fredan31> Leon is so dumb

[3:33:58] <YourFalloutCompanion> BANNED
[3:33:58] <VikingEagle> @AngriestPat I know you were against it more then any other member of the Zaibatsu, but is there any chance an RE6 LP will ever happen if you run out of glass to break?
[3:33:59] <+SailingSaturn> Which item?
[3:34:00] <Rellim80> I think @AngriestPat needs to take all of us on a tour of his mind palace RE2 run just so we see it's diffrent than someone just thinking about the game.
[3:34:00] <yosukecchi> not even on opposite sides of the bridge!
[3:34:00] <MidnightSnack69> nekkid zombie booty
[3:34:02] <Havren13> Like he throws it down and it hits Ada, so you just hear, pause, thonk, "What the fu...!"
[3:34:02] <%AbnormalVoid> Kreygasm
[3:34:02] <marsano168> Why are the naked ones tougher? Because Shut up
[3:34:04] <+arcadeking48> So wait, how does Ada survive that?
[3:34:07] <CrimsonSkeletons> Gigalante plant monsters?

[3:34:15] <goddamndavid> Didn't you die to these as well?
[3:34:15] <+judaitoryn> so strong
[3:34:15] <LabTech41> I think the idea is that these guys were at Ground Zero of the outbreak, so they've been zombified the longest
[3:34:16] <chickendisasterx> "hey this thing caused this whole plaguing mess let me chuck it"
[3:34:18] <+tuesti> @arcadeking48 the power of love
[3:34:18] <%8BitDsx> So if Leon never threw the G-Virus, would the Umbrella agents track down and kill Leon?
[3:34:26] <elementofloyalty> BOSS FOUNTAIN
[3:34:27] <LabTech41> it was the same in RE1
[3:34:27] <frogurtz> Every Capcom game needs one moment of narmy dialogue.
[3:34:28] <$nademonkey1100> wait what was the finger print for?
[3:34:30] <nedtheelf> Naked strength: not held back by clothing debuffs
[3:34:31] <+arcadeking48> @tuesti They never said, did they?

[3:34:36] <grizzlywhisker> they were having an orgy when they got hit with the virus so they're all naked n stuff
[3:34:38] <+SolidusRex> @zedreamcast Fuck, I forgot about that, you're right.
[3:34:40] <+judaitoryn> GC?
[3:34:42] <shycommando> @AngriestPat its like you said during the RE2 play-though what if some random zombie comes along and just eats that shit up
[3:34:57] <sultanyz> Gg
[3:34:57] <Enryuan> For some reason the computer lady sounds like she is singing
[3:34:59] <+Kravedarknesss> @judaitoryn Dol;phin emulator of the GC version
[3:35:00] <+tuesti> @arcadeking48 i actually have no idea and that's a very good question actually
[3:35:00] <%daminshi> @judaitoryn Gamecube version, Dolphin Emulator, mod texture pack
[3:35:01] <$Chimeraelite> So are you going to take your time going through the remake or just tear through it like this playthrough ? @AngriestPat
[3:35:02] <Prism_Wing> At a certain point you just become so strong that you're immune to shame.
[3:35:06] <Thalchampz> 3 saves.
[3:35:07] <%knomad2b> big wins
[3:35:09] <%Agami23> modded dolphin emulation

[3:45:54] <CrimsonSkeletons> Pat is on that Zapping System high.
[3:45:57] <%RubberFistFight> @elementofloyalty actually i reckon stoned Pat/placid Pat would be horrifying and unusual.

[3:49:38] <%MisterCrimson> The problem with MML2 is that it's too short
[3:49:38] <Prism_Wing> Megaman Legends 1&2 are my most cherished games.

[3:50:16] <OspreySoul> Umbrella Corps
[3:50:16] <Mexrage> Gaiden is the worst
[3:50:19] <Androcecy> Pat, if there was a remaster of ANY of the Silent Hills games, how would it happen exactly?

[3:52:53] <%s_xylocalsingles> apatBig apatBig apatBig apatBig apatBig apatBig apatLiz

[3:53:09] <$RaikenTB> you can mod the PC version.
[3:53:11] <+Hamblasto> Dino Crisis 3 is a horror game for a very different reason
[3:53:11] <%OdysseyKnight> Pat plays with weighted training clothes
[3:53:20] <sultanyz> There is I think
[3:53:24] <SaiyanFantasyX> according to Max there is @angriestpat
[3:53:25] <bendatron> any plans on ever playing through re1 on the channel
[3:53:26] <+zedreamcast> If Pat took off the limiters he could probably hit world record time
[3:53:30] <+HCF249> my best time on re2 is 52minutes, so close, yet so far away
[3:53:31] <CrimsonSkeletons> I can't wait for JW3: Dino Crisis.
[3:53:37] <elementofloyalty> Sure
[3:53:40] <+capnbeeb> @AngriestPat What was that you mentioned about the definitive edition of Sleeping Dogs earlier?
[3:54:02] <+zaibatsu_member_333> dawww
[3:54:35] <%NMEDom> @AngriestPat are you aware Dino Crisis 2 has a Dino Vs mode?
[3:54:36] <Ran196> would you want to play a RE game with Sheva only?
[3:54:38] <Sielas> @AngriestPat got DMC4: SE recently and I suck, could barely beat some levels :(
[3:54:45] <elementofloyalty> YAWN
[3:54:48] <+SailingSaturn> Finished Dmc2 today, totally understand the hate
[3:54:52] <+fistorage> With all the samurai games lately, Onimusha would be cool to see.
[3:54:54] <+zaibatsu_member_333> Onimusha the true dark souls before dark souls
[3:54:59] <+SolidusRex> @Ran196 I'd be down for that.
[3:55:00] <%Agami23> i wish there was a new onimusha.
