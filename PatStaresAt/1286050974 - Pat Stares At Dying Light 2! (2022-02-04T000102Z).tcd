[0:14:47] <%slandracon> it's for people who wish for death @patstaresat
[0:14:48] <CD_Repo_Man> The backdown

[0:15:23] <%MooseIsGoose> We could then
[0:15:25] <+emperri> @PatStaresAt the rectum has a different blood supply than the rest of the bowel, which bypasses the liver so less alcohol gets removed immediately
[0:15:26] <%rumtumtugnutz> Nope

[0:34:47] <+ReallyBigRocks> bro ApplicationTitle.exe is my favorite video game
[0:34:52] <%Captainahab_37> Piranha Bytes are also distilled jank
[0:34:58] <%Captainahab_37> distributors
[0:35:04] <Fien111> Dying Light 2, the game Chris Avellone had NOTHING to do with after silently retiring
[0:35:05] <%hewlettfan96> @pendlez Is the game ever. Wha?
[0:35:11] <%maskofmichael> Question for chat: Would you rather a game with a lot of little bugs or a small amount of big bugs?
[0:35:11] <+izanagi22> catJAM
[0:35:19] <mr_saturday93> If someone like Paige can do a full time job then anyone can
[0:35:20] <0ld_man_boomer> you too? denver got like 2 feet snow
[0:35:29] <@PeachSaliva> @mr_saturday93 hey!
[0:35:31] <%Captainahab_37> i like a lot of big bugs thats why EDF is cool
[0:35:33] <+Pendlez> little bugs are funny
[0:35:38] <+Pendlez> save ruining shit sucks
[0:35:39] <mr_saturday93> @maskofmichael are the bugs gamebreaking?
[0:35:55] <mr_saturday93> @PeachSaliva imma just joking :P
[0:35:57] <%Sotetsu> I would love it if Paige streamed full time.
[0:36:00] <%maskofmichael> @mr_saturday93 Maybe
[0:36:03] <%Captainahab_37> does MH Rise on PC have some sort of data leak issue
[0:36:05] <Profmcstevie> Frequency of bugs is also a concern, a few bugs you encounter ALL THE TIME can suck ass
[0:36:06] <+Laycas49> @0ld_man_boomer What? I'm in the foothills and it's more like a foot
[0:36:06] <%whatsittoya> psaCrazyhand psaCrazyhead
[0:36:19] <@PeachSaliva> @sotetsu I’ve heavily considered it. Maybe someday!
[0:36:29] <+Pendlez> Paige is too funny to stream full time. she would be the new ninja
[0:36:35] <rekraparker> big bugs, unless they are save corruption
[0:36:37] <%Captainahab_37> memory leak*
[0:36:41] <Fien111> @maskofmichael Bethesda made a career out of the first I guess
[0:36:41] <+Pendlez> just not. yknow. awful
[0:36:45] <%Sotetsu> @peachsaliva You must really love your job. otzBlushA
[0:36:46] <0ld_man_boomer> it feels like 2 feet deep. going to the knees almost
[0:37:06] <+Laycas49> Maybe you got it worse down in the city
[0:37:25] <0ld_man_boomer> I think it's the accumulation rather than anything else winds blowing it in and it's got nowhere to go
[0:37:28] <%RayReborne> hey Paige, what's your job if you dont mind my asking? its obviously a work from home but doing what?
[0:37:54] <+Laycas49> Paige has a job?
[0:38:04] <%Sotetsu> Paige is an international diamond smuggler.

[0:47:56] <+Deschain212> same thing with this game
[0:47:57] <+king_of_beggars> The ending was the worst part, too.
[0:47:58] <@Jekado> yeah fucking SKIP the story
[0:48:01] <CatRidder> baby mode activate
[0:48:01] <Ozavic> This is a hard mode game
[0:48:03] <0ld_man_boomer> this is supposed to be WORSE 😂
[0:48:04] <SaltyAzteca> story was ok
[0:48:04] <%NopeBadguy> Dying Light 1 got to be very boring for me
[0:48:05] <TheeRabbi> The final boss was the dumbest fucking thing ever
[0:48:05] <GhostlySkunk> Storry is good
[0:48:05] <+ReallyBigRocks> perfect
[0:48:06] <+Pendlez> YEAHHH
[0:48:06] <%SaiyanShoto> The final boss is ASSSSSS

[0:48:08] <@Jekado> PUT that story in the TRASH
[0:48:08] <%Sotetsu> Story is too important to me. This is a pass

[0:48:09] <%maskofmichael> cool
[0:48:11] <deviljhojho_> i love games with great gameplay and shit story
[0:48:11] <%RayReborne> the story has entertainingly dumb moments in the first one
[0:48:12] <+Totally_Not_Toby> if it's worse ill like it more
[0:48:13] <%Captainahab_37> i beat dying light 1 3 times and i dont remember shit about the story
[0:48:14] <Ranger747> YOOOOO
[0:48:14] <GhostlySkunk> I didn't care for Dying light 1 tbh.
[0:48:17] <SaltyAzteca> its what I would expect
[0:48:17] <BepBepAmShep> The story is weirdly paced
[0:48:18] <%IronOhki> Yes Pat, you're normal.
[0:48:19] <%FingaLights> WHAT
[0:48:20] <%OverzealousEuthanasiast> doubling down
[0:48:20] <+Fefe41> @kingvantq ah got it
[0:48:20] <@Jekado> in all fairness the gameplay is all i care about
[0:48:21] <+ReallyBigRocks> 500 hours tho
[0:48:22] <%PocketBearIllustrator> hoo boy
[0:48:22] <Cha0ticSoul> ooohhh
[0:48:22] <%SpontaneousC> Dying Light 2 apparently decided it was going to stop being boring by doing a Morality Play
[0:48:23] <+king_of_beggars> It's fine, just pretend it's an MMO or something.
[0:48:24] <+DrFacilier> works for me, gameplay > story anyways
[0:48:25] <+trackles_64> Story is only bad if you have a pole up your ass
[0:48:26] <%owensleftfoot> You are not normal Pat
[0:48:26] <Jakeawienas> EXACTLY why i play it
[0:48:27] <ergulor> i remember the dlc ending being super weird
[0:48:27] <DrkJP520> i'm hard

[0:48:41] <tubit> i love you emlo
[0:48:42] <%PocketBearIllustrator> well, the gameplay is apparently good, so that's all that matters
[0:48:43] <%SWFanatic> <3 psaPorgmo
[0:48:44] <%SaiyanShoto> I don’t remember much about the story if dying light 1 except thinking it was dumb
[0:48:46] <+trackles_64> Kitty is a zombie
[0:48:47] <@Jekado> psaElmo psaElmo psaElmo
[0:48:48] <+transporterthesequel> Yeah they saw bad story and went “what if MORE STORY tho.”
[0:48:51] <%cade_calrayn> pet that cat
[0:48:54] <zanzibarian_hamster> Story is fine if you don't mind your sandbox character being kind of a dumbass
[0:48:54] <olm46> Dying Light 2: it's dying still
[0:48:55] <+NordiqueJer> Drop kick > Story EVERY TIME

[0:50:37] <%SaiyanShoto> At least Troy Baker backed down from the NFT thing

[0:51:13] <SaltyAzteca> Jonah Scott for Aiden
[0:51:13] <KingVantq> weird shadow on the log
[0:51:16] <%PatNTheHat> Better to carry a big brain
[0:51:16] <%SpontaneousC> I guess they just told him to do his best Troy Baker for the role
[0:51:16] <%JoshManVGH> Big Head Mode!
[0:51:16] <+Unknownedd> Streamer mode activates Big Head cheats.
[0:51:17] <+punchdrunk_donkeybooy> its on the log not the ground dummy
[0:51:18] <DrkJP520> the shadow is on the tree, which was closer to you, genius
[0:51:22] <mr_saturday93> apparently spike was from the first game
[0:51:24] <%baka_sugoi> BIG AND SMOOTH
[0:51:24] <%JoshManVGH> sofarfIQ
[0:51:25] <black_mages_matter_> shadow puzzles are contagious
[0:51:25] <%SaiyanShoto> People who hate motion blur don’t know what good motion blur is
[0:51:26] <+TheRealestApple> big brain for planning all those big jumps
[0:51:27] <%FingaLights> is it big?
[0:51:29] <ape_hawk> yes, a big smooth brain
[0:51:32] <+Nkbzodiac> the shadow is closer

[0:51:46] <%Captainahab_37> different protag
[0:51:47] <heartlesshealer> I love traversal shit
[0:51:52] <0ld_man_boomer> the smooth water brain gives him better aerodynamics
[0:51:54] <heartlesshealer> new protag, not Cole
[0:51:54] <KingVantq> @avospread nope that guys super dead
[0:51:55] <%cooldude69xx> @SaiyanShoto It's more that motion blur is bad too often
[0:51:59] <+Hellarussian> why is it called Dying Light if the sun is still out? hmm
[0:51:59] <%rumtumtugnutz> Smooth brain for making sure everything goes smoothly

[0:52:19] <deathyGZ> astonished by how his voice is just crane
[0:52:21] <%JoshManVGH> Oh this guy did Legoshi.
[0:52:25] <%Captainahab_37> would anyone want to play a zombie game for 500 hours tbh

[0:54:31] <%arcaderabbit48> My eyes burn seeing a menu like that
[0:54:32] <CanadianAnimatorGuy> It's that saying "chamomile and honey are crafting ingredients in your crafting menu"
[0:54:33] <heartlesshealer> crafting was always core dying light gameplay
[0:54:34] <%owensleftfoot> oh god that animation loosk terrible
[0:54:37] <ape_hawk> fist the zombies
[0:54:37] <%MyNameIsRasus> It's a type of bird

[0:54:43] <%Dakuu75> I feel like you'd have to indgest camomile and honey on the regular for it to help...
[0:54:49] <heartlesshealer> hopefully they make it work
[0:54:49] <+michingmallecho> Dying light 2 is secretly the origin story for The Pain

[0:55:38] <tubit> did she bring enough to share with chat
[0:55:39] <CanadianAnimatorGuy> As scripted as this is, it's find of nice that it's not just a big cutscene at the start
[0:55:41] <heartlesshealer> Controls
[0:55:44] <@Ranryu692> controls is the next section
[0:55:49] <%FingaLights> Isn't this the game that is suppose to be branching story paths depending on your choices?
[0:56:04] <+Hellarussian> oh

[1:06:44] <%DovaDude29> Spike sending mixed messages. Like a will they won’t they romcom
[1:06:45] <%Saadi90> Relationships are complicated
[1:06:46] <TheeRabbi> Hey it's the Waitress from Always Sunny
[1:06:47] <$Solid_Stro> Bring a skeleton back for Paige
[1:06:48] <heartlesshealer> eww, just realized sense is hold down a stick press
[1:06:49] <+YabbaTroll> Remember when Dead Island became a moba for some reason?
[1:06:55] <+transporterthesequel> Nah its “im starting to worry about you, which means its time to leave this area.”
[1:06:55] <hereiam407> If they so in love, why they so dead
[1:07:00] <%cade_calrayn> suicide cult I believe?
[1:07:05] <+emperri> did they all drink poison kool aid or what
[1:07:05] <+king_of_beggars> Classy skeleton with its monocle and all.
[1:07:09] <+V3RTIGO_222> Game wants you to feel bad man
[1:07:09] <%JumboCrunchies> How did all these people die just.. chilling at a party.
[1:07:10] <%owensleftfoot> Did Paige always have a skeleton fetish or did it start with Papytus?
[1:07:13] <%JumboCrunchies> Like they all look comfy
[1:07:17] <hereiam407> Over the mountain
[1:07:22] <+king_of_beggars> Look at all those towers to climb in the distance.
[1:07:25] <Dova573> Does this take place in the same made up country?
[1:07:25] <+jingokrieg> Why isn't sense on RB ?, why tf do you have to HOLD the right stick
[1:07:30] <%Captainahab_37> are those developers
[1:07:30] <hereiam407> Developer pictures?
[1:07:31] <%toolofparanoia> DAVE
[1:07:38] <tubit> @JumboCrunchies poison
[1:07:39] <%strakillias> Look at those developers
[1:07:43] <+V3RTIGO_222> are these all dev pics or random stock images? you guess
[1:07:44] <%MyNameIsRasus> @hereiam407 big "if the universe is so big why won't it fight me" vibes from this message
[1:07:45] <KingVantq> @jingokrieg RB is jump
[1:07:59] <insomniac_doze_> FeelsBadMan
[1:07:59] <+king_of_beggars> "Let's just keep this note."
[1:08:00] <TheAntiNihilist> So dumb
[1:08:05] <mr_saturday93> 20
[1:08:10] <+wmeldrum> Aiden everyman mr action man
[1:08:11] <hereiam407> @MyNameIsRasus Exactly, it like, cmon already
[1:08:11] <%BinaryFireball> but the player.... should...be?
[1:08:12] <%BinaryFireball> lol
[1:08:13] <%chiazam> No
[1:08:16] <+V3RTIGO_222> yeahhhh... i dont get why this is a big deal
[1:08:17] <%baka_sugoi> Zombies man FeelsBadMan
[1:08:17] <%superc37> dead rising
[1:08:19] <%OverzealousEuthanasiast> just another Tuesday
[1:08:20] <+AlucardX60> Kinda like nowadays?
[1:08:25] <+V3RTIGO_222> have they not seen people get eaten alive?
[1:08:26] <%toolofparanoia> everyone dead, but not dead inside
[1:08:27] <@ssjklyco> We're getting close to it in real life
[1:08:29] <+emperri> this truly was the last of us
[1:08:30] <TurtlesAndTentacles> Or they have emotion to ginger bread man
[1:08:31] <%superc37> thats basically dead rising tbh
[1:08:32] <XeroRaizer> so did the apocalypse happen because of that one guy leaking the virus data?
[1:08:34] <Dova573> Oh so the outbreak got out of that country from the first game?
[1:08:35] <+insanityv2> i think the idea is that the zombie apoc was over and things went back to normal for a while and then ANOTHER outbreak occured
[1:08:36] <$ArcanumArcanum> You can live in denial for 14 years but when that 15th year roles around that's when it sets in
[1:08:37] <%Captainahab_37> i think the implication is your character is a young dude
[1:08:37] <%marvel877> So like the current pandemic then, Pat?
[1:08:37] <+polothegreatest> just a gun with 1 bullet, just in case NotLikeThis
[1:08:38] <%moonmintparadise> he haz za emotions
[1:08:38] <+king_of_beggars> Man this IS a nice crib. It's like one of those MTV cribs I keep hearing about.
[1:08:40] <%couch_potato_Ed_Boy> Me: "Wow, look. Dead people."
[1:08:44] <%Captainahab_37> so he hasn't seen much yet
[1:08:44] <+The_Death_Owl> we truly are the walking dead
[1:08:45] <%kn0wmad1c> Quick pat
[1:08:49] <%kn0wmad1c> Use scavenger sense
[1:08:51] <+jingokrieg> @jingokrieg I know but having sense on R3 is gross, why the hell would they want you to hold it
[1:08:52] <GilliamYaeger> This is a nice opening.
[1:08:52] <%kn0wmad1c> Make that alcohol glow
[1:08:53] <hereiam407> We truly were the Dying Light in this world
[1:08:54] <%toolofparanoia> This is truly our dying light too
[1:08:57] <UncleBust> "thats my piss bottle"
[1:09:06] <+clevernamewhere> this place is bordering on a compound
[1:09:09] <%RayReborne> huh????
[1:09:10] <+Totally_Not_Toby> this dude's voice acting is weird
[1:09:11] <%Captainahab_37> the Dying Light were the people we met along the way
[1:09:14] <SaltyAzteca> awwwwww
[1:09:16] <+LevelUpSlick> WOAH!
[1:09:16] <+king_of_beggars> I wouldn't drink anything from a house where everybody had a "party death". Shit is probably poison.
[1:09:19] <Khester824> Who?
[1:09:19] <Brapula_> Wha?
[1:09:20] <+The_Death_Owl> spike doesn't look or sound like spike
[1:09:21] <+YabbaTroll> First game protag?
[1:09:21] <$ArcanumArcanum> Crane was first game protagonist for those who don't know
[1:09:22] <%RayReborne> wait is this Spike from HARRAN??
[1:09:23] <SaltyAzteca> well shiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiit
[1:09:24] <%owensleftfoot> Nope
[1:09:25] <+LevelUpSlick> yes
[1:09:27] <%BinaryFireball> videogames have desensitized me too much to care about any of this on an emotional level
[1:09:27] <+Deschain212> what
[1:09:28] <%RayReborne> oh yeah!!
[1:09:29] <copametic> the sunset truly is a dying light
[1:09:29] <heartlesshealer> oh, he knew protag
[1:09:30] <mr_saturday93> dude from the 1st game
[1:09:30] <+emperri> crane is the first game guy
[1:09:31] <%AkronymCLT> "I wish the last protagonist could have seen this"
[1:09:32] <+Captain_Spicy_> Oh no! My Jenkem bottle!
[1:09:32] <%kn0wmad1c> Crane is MC from first game
[1:09:33] <%Dakuu75> wtf, who just brings up "wish BLANK was here" to a guy who never met BLANK
[1:09:33] <%RayReborne> he totally could be
[1:09:34] <+jingokrieg> Nah he becomes one of the big split jaw fuckers
[1:09:34] <%AgniBrandt> @PatStaresAt Crane is the first game's protag
[1:09:34] <%tank7013> Yea it's Spike
[1:09:38] <outofbonelesswings> Ye d1 MC
[1:09:38] <UncleBust> no just a big fraiser fan
[1:09:38] <%CatastropheCorvid> @RayReborne YUP
[1:09:40] <KingVantq> White is extra
[1:09:41] <%SovPho> Yes, he's a runner that was the supplier for the scientist in the first game.
[1:09:42] <+Hellarussian> white is probably optional
[1:09:42] <+LevelUpSlick> yellow is progress
[1:09:43] <+izanagi22> I think Yellow advances
[1:09:43] <KingVantq> Yellow is progress
[1:09:44] <MrGreenToS> You did missions for him in 1
[1:09:46] <%maskofmichael> yes
[1:09:46] <+V3RTIGO_222> bruh, the game really wants you to have feelings and its forced af
[1:09:46] <%greasypete00> so they definitely had a different plot where it was originally crane again right? because why would they use the same VA
[1:09:46] <%baka_sugoi> Dosnt matter
[1:09:47] <SaltyAzteca> Crane didnt make it? BibleThump
[1:09:48] <BepBepAmShep> Yellow goes forward
[1:09:48] <%Captainahab_37> piss yellow usually means forward
[1:09:48] <%baka_sugoi> right
[1:09:49] <+Deschain212> this MC sounds exactly like Crane what the fuck
[1:09:49] <%FingaLights> Spike crain?
[1:09:49] <Grimdogx> The yellow ones I would assume
[1:09:50] <SubjectX07x> White extra, gold forward
[1:09:52] <%SovPho> Yellow goes forward
[1:09:53] <+The_Death_Owl> what guy is extra
[1:09:53] <$add0607> yes
[1:09:53] <+samuraiknack> Yella
[1:09:53] <+crazyspartan214> BOTH
[1:09:53] <+trackles_64> white is optional
[1:10:02] <zanzibarian_hamster> "What guy?" "The guy from the fisrt game, didn't you play it?"
[1:10:03] <owazowski> Yellow is progress
[1:10:08] <+jingokrieg> @SaltyAzteca Nah sadly, the DLC confirms it
[1:10:28] <%kn0wmad1c> kn0wmad1c is gifting 1 Tier 1 Subs to PatStaresAt's community! They've gifted a total of 1 in the channel! 
[1:10:28] <Grimdogx> Didn't Crane turn into the Night Haunter?
[1:10:30] <%kn0wmad1c> kn0wmad1c gifted a Tier 1 sub to merilethal! 
[1:10:30] <%owensleftfoot> @SaltyAzteca Isn't the DLC non-canon?
[1:10:32] <%Captainahab_37> the GRE is EVIL!!!!!1
[1:10:43] <%lightbringrrrr> WHERE WALTZ AT MAN?!?!
[1:10:51] <%Dakuu75> why are ppl afraid of them?
[1:10:54] <%chiazam> What the fuck are Pilgrims?
[1:10:59] <SpookyMooks> deliver this rock to gary
[1:11:02] <XeroRaizer> nobody like pilgrims they just go where they need too

[1:11:19] <%SovPho> Name a more millenial name than Aiden
[1:11:20] <Grimdogx> I have no clue why people are "Afraid" of them
[1:11:20] <%chiazam> Why would people hate the people who deliver shit in an apocalypse
[1:11:22] <%strakillias> Pilgrims might be the worst version of this naming trope I've ever seen.
[1:11:25] <+emperri> write that down
[1:11:25] <+izanagi22> I bet he was talking to Waltz
[1:11:26] <%chiazam> Didn’t we already do that
[1:11:27] <hereiam407> Mmm, warm flat beer
[1:11:27] <Dova573> man that beer must taste like EXTRA SHIT
[1:11:29] <%Dakuu75> this is basically death stranding, with zombies. you're a delivery guy "pilgrim"
[1:11:31] <$realm_forge> It’s a calcified poop. It’s sentimental
[1:11:34] <%kn0wmad1c> That antenna will also unlock all the points of interest on the map, Aiden
[1:11:42] <CatRidder> and unlock keypoints in the map
[1:11:54] <+The_Death_Owl> Delivery men truly are the best gaming protagonists
[1:11:57] <mastermidget23> wait, I thought this didn't come out until midnight.  did he get early access?
[1:11:59] <+vanareus> would your. character not know what a zone is?

[1:18:18] <HanPaul> PridePog
[1:18:19] <hereiam407> They are in my eyes
[1:18:21] <%SovPho> @CrimsonDio11 Zombie apocalypse stuff is less believable in a universe where the subject is trodden so thoroughly.
[1:18:21] <+TheRealestApple> so are there just gonna be like 5000 beehives everywhere
[1:18:22] <Grimdogx> Can the Bees be zombies

[1:18:34] <+Deschain212> @RayReborne yea but the gameplay is the same
[1:18:39] <AMERICA_YEA> My Suitcase full of bees should put a stop to that

[1:19:17] <SpookyMooks> double cheeked up zombo
[1:19:22] <Calamity2007> Reset the clock on streams without a Jerma reference

[1:19:39] <%cooldude69xx> @AncelDeLambert No zombie story thinks that far ahead
[1:19:47] <+sermittens> can't see shit indoors
[1:19:54] <Grimdogx> Pretty sure Dying Light zombies are "Technically" alive, long as they keep eating they keep living
[1:19:55] <%OverzealousEuthanasiast> Jurassic Park 2
[1:20:02] <+trackles_64> all the guns dissapeared

[1:20:07] <+The_Death_Owl> of course Pat knows all the woolieLORE
[1:20:08] <%maskofmichael> Hay Pat, say Zombussy
[1:20:16] <+sonofthedeepsouth> Pat will join the authoritarian faction because humanity would need order and structure to survive in times as trying as this game present Kappa.

[1:22:33] <+Tucker0603> oww hands
[1:22:34] <hereiam407> @Grimdogx Yeh, but not everyone thinks the same thing when someone says zombie

[1:24:02] <%SWFanatic> the lights are off
[1:24:03] <%MyNameIsRasus> In any other game that would've killed you
[1:24:04] <%owensleftfoot> Why were your hands showing on the river
[1:24:04] <tanarath> Imagine just buttered toast with a ton of good omelette on there.

[1:35:55] <%SovPho> @slipdog it's really not a big deal, the first thing that happens in Dying Light is he gets infected. How he dies is between nuking the island (correct choice) or becoming some sort of hive-mind Volatile with the ability to communicate with all infected telepathically.

[1:39:34] <+The_Death_Owl> @hereiam407 the first game was a government agent trying to get sensitive documents back but siding with the people of the city

[1:54:19] <@Jekado> what is the movie logic
[1:54:20] <%RayReborne> you can jump over the guy you vault kick i THINK
[1:54:21] <hereiam407> He gotta stumble to the ground
[1:54:21] <+Rare_Ruiz> You can probably chain the parkour dropkicks and kill a group by bouncing off them like Mario.
[1:54:22] <%Felhad> Place balls on chin
[1:54:23] <%twistedj3ster> you were saying?
[1:54:24] <Profmcstevie> Run,

[1:54:53] <%Brassnarwhal> @jekado you mean the assassins creed method of taking out heroes?
[1:54:58] <%baka_sugoi> you didnt equip
[1:54:59] <HotMafia81> You kicked all the blood right out of that guy
[1:54:59] <KingVantq> Its in your inventory since your weapon slots were full
[1:55:01] <%AncelDeLambert> the camera flitting around as you hyper-bounce around everything is really awkward
[1:55:03] <StaceMcGate> THEY ARE ALL BALD
[1:55:03] <%chiazam> Equip it?
[1:55:04] <Count_Cool> Wow! That actually looks pretty effin' cool, the way you just sorta' clip through them.
[1:55:05] <+The_Death_Owl> his mask coming off is satisfying
[1:55:06] <%shootbang_exe> the ragdolls are great

[1:55:28] <+CrimsonDio11> damn every time he kicks them and the masks fly off I thought he was kicking their heads off
[1:55:29] <%RaziWraith> Looks like any human with a melee weapon is gonna be a chump in this game

[1:56:15] <+Your_Lord_and_Senpai> this looks sick
[1:56:16] <DrkJP520> isn't there a prompt on the guy you vault kick?
[1:56:17] <+The_Death_Owl> nah pat you're right when they rerelease Skyrim again they should improve combat

[2:13:05] <AdamDglgmut11> I love how the ladder doesn't cost stamina even though it's also climbing at the same rate
[2:13:24] <%KeiganOfAstora> Ladder is smaller steps, not working as hard
[2:13:27] <joniroquai> So roof grove = resupply station, got it
[2:13:31] <+TopTieramisu> @AdamDglgmut11 stamina is stored in the finger tips

[2:30:33] <hereiam407> Kids are easy for emotional storytelling, right?
[2:30:34] <+OG_M_Bison> @SaiyanShoto Besides the gameplay this whole thing is cringe
[2:30:37] <cpt_langosta> he went back to JAZZ
[2:30:39] <+ShinEllison> is this just a western version of the incest couple as a story
[2:30:39] <%TheGreatSkenardo> ...why wouldn;t you wait until day

[2:30:59] <cpt_langosta> i thought that said "NIGHT EXPLOSION"
[2:30:59] <+Havictos> @Mr_Pylon Because children are mysterious creatures obviously. I mean what even is a child anyway
[2:31:02] <+OG_M_Bison> When you can't sleep and it's still night out. I know the feeling

[2:31:41] <yourliteraldog> My guy hates condoms
[2:31:42] <+GenesysCreed> Mood honestly
[2:31:49] <%croxeye> so, one of the things i hate about these types of "How can you trust tho?" qustions is that you have to trust someone at some point
[2:31:52] <zerointelligence000> they could get parkour powers
[2:31:53] <DrkJP520> dying lit
[2:31:54] <+ItalianWaifu> yeah but if they lived they would be badasses
[2:32:00] <%TheGreatSkenardo> Why would you go out in night time at all
[2:32:01] <%MyNameIsRasus> Pullout game is weak
[2:32:03] <+Totally_Not_Toby> i mean being alive is better than being dead, like generally speaking
[2:32:05] <AdamDglgmut11> I guess condoms are rare in this world
[2:32:13] <agripina> I don't know Hakon, you could raise a super soldier child.

[2:32:43] <+Gorgonson> LUL

[2:37:59] <%chiazam> Pat
[2:38:03] <PerfectAsymmetry> Yeah I've played Skyrim
[2:38:04] <hereiam407> LUL
[2:38:06] <SaltyAzteca> one was like this
[2:38:07] <smallheals> skyrim was one of the best lockpicking minigames
[2:38:08] <+megaotter> "never should have come here"
[2:38:09] <+CptCreampuff16> i mean is there a better version of lockpicking?
[2:38:09] <%DanThePumpkinman> why was it the bottom of a padlock when it was a door lock?
[2:38:10] <+ThomasOfTroy> careful with that edge buddy'
[2:38:10] <+ReallyBigRocks> you really have to be a shitty lockpicker to snap a tool

[2:38:27] <%FingaLights> k, no need to get angry
[2:38:28] <%AJ_Cherenkov> hot take: we need a better lockpicking minigame than skyrim
[2:38:28] <$Cthulos> Has Pat played the original?
[2:38:29] <AdamDglgmut11> I think Skyrim and Splinter Cell had the best lockpicking mechanics
[2:38:29] <+SpinalWizard> How many sit ups?

[2:56:13] <SpookyMooks> Then again DL1's story was kinda stank too
[2:56:13] <agripina> because xenophobia
[2:56:15] <hereiam407> Maybe all the Pilgrims are super soldiers

[3:03:53] <%BlackStarAura> To go with last night’s vagina bread
[3:03:58] <WinglessParatroopa> First game it felt like forever of smacking a head with a pipe before they finally died
[3:03:59] <+RobertWayneLewis98> When enemies get numbers and hp bars above their heads, expect an easier game.
[3:04:02] <%Bread_Assassin> How much of a connection does this game have to the first game?
[3:04:05] <WinglessParatroopa> (at least at the start)
[3:04:11] <Hibub277> @grandmasterbfunk I meant rhetorically
[3:04:11] <%ruben8802> the real monsters are the humans
[3:04:12] <hereiam407> Moldy
[3:04:25] <Meltgar> So how's been the game chat? Pat hasn't broken anything like a goblin yet? Kappa

[3:04:48] <+ReallyBigRocks> that's just a pile of dirt on a tarp
[3:04:48] <akitanito> they buried the tarp
[3:04:48] <%JustTheGuyYouNeed> Did they bury somebody on concrete ?
[3:04:49] <%TheGreatSkenardo> why would you bury someone in the middle of a fuckin street
[3:04:51] <+ThomasOfTroy> "bye bye daddy"? Really?

[3:04:59] <GrandmasterBFunk> @Hibub277 sorry, it's twitch, people legitimately will come into a chat and ask what game it is even though it's literally in the title of the stream
[3:05:00] <akitanito> It's finnnneeee
[3:05:01] <%ruben8802> does it say bye bye daddy?
[3:05:01] <%mield916> how did they dig the grave into pavement

[3:14:57] <%VentWilsn> woulda been hilarious if you died from the fall damage right in front of him
[3:15:00] <shevan123> did they up the ost quality from the first one?
[3:15:00] <%notsoy> fall damage has probably hurt him worse than zombies at this point lol

[3:16:22] <%BlackStarAura> I love him
[3:16:27] <GilliamYaeger> @FingaLights They're all vampires, the stronger they are the more they're affected. The piss weak biters are reduced to being drunk instead of running around doing parkour, the strong ones can't go into sunlight at all.

[3:17:58] <HotMafia81> Just little wheezy barks
[3:18:06] <%VentWilsn> oh RTX is doing that, made it sound like Zangief barked with his mouth in a tube
[3:18:17] <%AgniBrandt> @PatStaresAt I've got a 3080 like you and am managing 1440p, RTX on, DLSS balanced at 60-75 FPS
[3:18:25] <@Ranryu692> You can just turn RTX off psaDogchamp
[3:18:27] <KingVantq> @PatStaresAt i think Digital Foundry put out their pc video for this earlier if you wanna check that out
[3:18:29] <%AgniBrandt> I'm still in tutorial but fingers crossed
[3:18:34] <Jetsfantasy> Yeah, streaming using GPU means finding a balance of game juice and stream juice
[3:18:40] <Ragnorok64> Have you thought of getting a dual PC streaming setup going?
[3:18:45] <StaceMcGate> I can see not playing this again, open world and especially zombie games have been oversaturated
[3:18:53] <GilliamYaeger> BEES

[3:19:45] <%ruben8802> "must've been the wind"

[3:25:18] <+Havictos> @Axellogic Did he even work on this?
[3:25:18] <badguy8312> @grandmasterbfunk I think he's just an idiot
[3:25:20] <BreakfastSampler> I fucking hate dialogue trees with only one option - just say it
[3:25:20] <%Mr_Pylon> This dude has the vibe of a kid who's going to fail at the science fair
[3:25:20] <Profmcstevie> The end of days has only been 15 years, does nobody read
[3:25:23] <+trackles_64> Super Cool

[3:25:38] <+Zetheos> :O
[3:25:39] <+ThomasOfTroy> @GrandmasterBFunk it's probably a 'hahaha lost technology' joke
[3:25:40] <%Axellogic> @Havictos Yeah but they dropped him after the controversy stuff with him
[3:25:41] <%AncelDeLambert> @Mr_Pylon that's basically what he's doing
[3:25:42] <@Ranryu692> this game's tone is weird

[3:26:20] <+emperri> this tone is like fucking Outer Worlds
[3:26:21] <FlaskOfManyThings> This game is dripping with sequence breaks
[3:26:26] <%baka_sugoi> Is this a fallout game???
[3:26:26] <%marvel877> This is why the game's 500 hours long, huh?
[3:26:26] <%AncelDeLambert> YOU ANIMALS! YOU BLEW IT UP! DAMN YOUUUUUUU!

[3:26:29] <%RayReborne> @mr_pylon 2036
[3:26:31] <%CappuccinoGuil> @emperri the way they talk, it sounds like they all lost access to technology and history? Like, Electric Fence being a "genius name invention"?
[3:26:31] <Sunstalker> did you not play DL1? Sidequests are always weirdos
[3:26:31] <Explodincatz> Zombies in Skyrim
[3:26:34] <akitanito> freakers didn't kill dying light, it's the weird NPCs

[3:27:05] <%Mr_Pylon> HE IS DOING A SCIENCE FAIR EXHIBIT
[3:27:08] <%JustTheGuyYouNeed> For this to work the game needs to take place in like 100 years in the future not fucking 15

[3:29:17] <TheStrongBanana> Don't let that man craft anything please
[3:29:17] <Gorgs7> why not?
[3:29:18] <%BlackStarAura> I can’t believe that I’m rooting for the apocalypse

[3:29:27] <%chiazam> Why not?
[3:29:28] <+Caidezes> This is amazing.
[3:29:31] <%Big50boyy> NO this guy is dangerous!!!!
[3:29:33] <%Dementedpenguin> What the FUCK was this objective?
[3:29:34] <%Mr_Pylon> What is this dude's cadence?!?!
[3:29:35] <%greasypete00> this game seems dumb
[3:29:36] <%Big50boyy> ?!?!?!
[3:29:37] <%DovaDude29> These folks are gonna die in this bucket of a town, huh
[3:29:37] <GIIJOSE> its electrocuted not poison
[3:29:37] <Hibub277> This man is old enough to know what an electric fence is
[3:29:38] <%Undenizen> This isn't Dead By Daylight!
[3:29:38] <akitanito> also he has a tiny ass wrench
[3:29:39] <XoftheTITANS> eat goat
[3:29:39] <+emperri> and the poop
[3:29:39] <%Saadi90> I am too sober for this
[3:29:40] <%AncelDeLambert> one word: ruptured intestines
[3:29:41] <+CptCreampuff16> and?
[3:29:41] <%Dementedpenguin> What just happened.
[3:29:42] <jumpyhugs> WELL GET DRAININ
[3:29:42] <%JonathLP> EAT GOAT!
[3:29:43] <+Zetheos> we can drain the blood later?
[3:29:44] <%marvel877> So wait, are we going to use the dead goat's body as a weapon or something?
[3:29:44] <+emperri> more importantly the poop
[3:29:47] <%SaiyanShoto> I keep hearing crapmaster
[3:29:47] <hereiam407> Get outta town
[3:29:49] <+ItalianWaifu> that was stupid
[3:29:50] <+chestertonfencer> If they drained it right away afteward it'd be fine
[3:29:50] <%DashXero> The blood can't be retroactively drained?
[3:29:51] <CataractCat> Murder him pat
[3:29:51] <%MrGuy516> @there were literally electric fence traps on the first game
[3:29:51] <TheStrongBanana> the blood is where the flavor is though
[3:29:52] <valstriam> @havictos holy shit, they have goldfish memory
[3:29:53] <XoftheTITANS> eat it raw
[3:29:53] <akitanito> you can just drain the blood now
[3:29:53] <+AmanisHouseOfNonsense> This feels like a badly written Yakuza side quest
[3:29:54] <%HotSauceFiend> blood will coagulate and the tissus will rot
[3:29:56] <CataractCat> Pls murder him
[3:29:56] <GIIJOSE> its not like u couldnt do it after the fact
[3:29:57] <badguy8312> that's some prime satanist talk there Pat
[3:29:58] <Gelphaze> Kill that GOAT!
[3:30:00] <%rkbinder> ifs fine in the first hour
[3:30:00] <cthulu_fearlock> why do you know that pat?
[3:30:00] <%RayReborne> oh hey the Electric blueprint from the first game
[3:30:01] <hereiam407> Dont eat the butt you dingus
[3:30:01] <+CptCreampuff16> you can still drain blood while dead
[3:30:01] <Mirrorcatch> the blood gives flavor
[3:30:01] <AdamDglgmut11> It'll be really hard to drain and butcher it without it being alive first
[3:30:02] <gasallbullies> just butcher it lol
[3:30:03] <ergulor> cmon pat free electrogoat, it cannot be that bad
[3:30:03] <+Solutha> good thing its only been 1 minuitre
[3:30:05] <%SaiyanShoto> The poop adds spice
[3:30:05] <@Moobot> Hey folks, just a reminder! If you have Twitch connected to Discord, you can access the PSA Sub-Discord. Go to your User Settings, go to Connections, and click 'Join' on the PSA server under the Twitch connection.
[3:30:06] <+thatotherblackson> the poison will make them stronger in the long run
[3:30:09] <%maskofmichael> Being poisoned is better then zombie I guess
[3:30:10] <Sypheck> these NPCs are definitely crapmasters LUL
[3:30:10] <AdamDglgmut11> But it's doable, it'll just be harder
[3:30:12] <tanarath> Well, what if they cut it's throat now?
[3:30:12] <+dante_must_die_exe> all of its poop AND pee
[3:30:12] <$SGrim> You can still drain an animal that has been electrocuted as long as your quick about it.
[3:30:15] <%SveriSageAdvice> you have to kill it in a specific way, you can't like just cook the goat while it's standing
[3:30:15] <+ninja_galt> you can't add a blowtorch to a machete and get any kind of legit improvement in combat effectiveness
[3:30:16] <%JustTheGuyYouNeed> Did those fuckers just learned how electricity works ?
[3:30:19] <%RealThiele> like it just died so just butcher it
[3:30:23] <Profmcstevie> Can't eat it....but I DO now have an electric goat
[3:30:24] <+Nomenanza> we made these people eat the poop goat just to learn how to attach a battery to a knife
[3:30:25] <AdamDglgmut11> Gotta do it like NOW
[3:30:25] <%ruben8802> drain the poop like hercules
[3:30:27] <%marvel877> Wait, they never thought to ever do that?
[3:30:29] <%RayReborne> yeah man
[3:30:31] <%VentWilsn> Am I the only person who hears Crapmaster anytime they say craftmaster?
[3:30:33] <Gorgs7> these are the opinions of someone that doesn't know shit about meat...
[3:30:38] <+trackles_64> Kunai
[3:30:45] <badguy8312> @justtheguyyouneed how to weaponize more like, still fucking dumb as hell
[3:30:46] <+Javaa01> @patstaresat You are aware electric shock is the accepted way of killing livestock, yes?
[3:30:48] <%marvel877> Have these weirdos never heard of a taser?
[3:30:51] <+ninja_galt> PAT! play Project Zomboid instead
[3:30:53] <StaceMcGate> Why does this European city have American accents?
[3:30:53] <AdamDglgmut11> @VentWilsn I'm the crap master here
[3:30:55] <+Havictos> @valstriam Yeah it's super fucking weird it appears people are approaching 40k levels of forgetting how tech works
[3:30:55] <thatdudenamedlogan> just came in, how is this game so far?
[3:30:57] <%RayReborne> tip and shaft
[3:30:58] <%pokefan9956> ITS BEEN 15 YEARS. HOW DID THEY FORGET ABOUT ELECTRICITY
[3:30:59] <%RayReborne> Kappa
[3:31:00] <%MidnightBurst12> LUL

[3:31:12] <%VentWilsn> @AdamDglgmut11 come to my crapmaster table later
[3:31:12] <+trackles_64> Get rekt by devs
[3:31:21] <badguy8312> @javaa01 yeah but they typically hang them using machinery these days to drain
[3:31:23] <%JustToWatch> this game is a fucking fever dream
[3:31:24] <myriad_truth> The game knows Pat
[3:31:26] <AdamDglgmut11> @VentWilsn I got some crap for ya
[3:31:27] <Ciglossonjr> This game is a feverdream
[3:31:28] <+Havictos> @pokefan9956 They're using electricity what the hell
[3:31:30] <%BlackStarAura> Why not rip off Ghost of Tsushima while they’re at it? They took everything else from AC, Skyrim…
[3:31:32] <SomeAsianDood> Polish devs man
[3:31:34] <%CalderGaming> @thatdudenamedlogan gameplay good, script and voice acting are oblivion/stalker levels of harring
[3:31:34] <%baka_sugoi> bonkers
[3:31:34] <akitanito> what could they even do with electronics if they don't even understand electricity?
[3:31:36] <zevenmillion> You know what? This reminds me of Dead Island
[3:31:37] <%HotSauceFiend> I'm playing cyberpunk 2077 RN at this game is great in comparison already
[3:31:41] <%marvel877> Would they freak the fuck out if I showed them a Game Boy or something?
[3:31:41] <XoftheTITANS> its the devs
[3:31:42] <%CalderGaming> *jarring
[3:31:43] <+Zetheos> go find that dog

[3:42:57] <Explodincatz> experience is a more impactful tool for learning
[3:43:00] <%Big50boyy> @Havictos I'm assuming they just decided on a similar VA, and this isn't crane?
[3:43:01] <hereiam407> I mean, I figured if people were this far into a zombie apocalypse, they would be building all sorts of wacky zombie killing devices
[3:43:01] <AdamDglgmut11> A slide would go far in this game to make the parkour more fluid
[3:43:03] <FlaskOfManyThings> FORSAKEN STORES

[3:44:33] <Hibub277> Are you a sith?
[3:44:35] <%RayReborne> GRE key
[3:44:35] <+hasansviewcountbot> @PatStaresAt do you think with Elden Ring's massive world that there will be a illusionary wall so obscure that no one finds it?
[3:44:36] <+Nomenanza> the bee radar?
[3:44:36] <+Havictos> @PatStaresAt I think it's your biomarker
[3:44:37] <cpt_langosta> wtf, cordyceps?
[3:44:37] <+ItalianWaifu> the kids saw you  kill those guys
[3:44:39] <FlaskOfManyThings> That was the upgrade syringe sound
[3:44:40] <Explodincatz> HEV Hazard Suit?!
[3:44:40] <StaceMcGate> sounded like the half life suit voice
[3:44:40] <%FingaLights> HAV Suit??
[3:44:42] <%Mr_Pylon> Pocket Bees, the upgrade to pocket sand
[3:44:43] <+Gorgonson> this game is fucking hilarious
[3:44:43] <%Mantorok06> Why does this combat remind me of Condemned criminal origins or Dead Island?
[3:44:51] <hereiam407> I get it, the whole game takes place in a simulation
[3:44:52] <%Big50boyy> @Havictos kk just got super thrown off when I heard him talk lmao I could swear 1 had a super bleak end
[3:44:55] <badguy8312> that's a mutant man
[3:44:55] <+KevinsLunchbox> the school kids literally heard you kill those dudes
[3:44:58] <%RealThiele> Nuclear Launch depected
[3:44:58] <+Nomenanza> damn that man just flew like 2 stories high
[3:45:00] <SomeAsianDood> @AdamDglgmut11 unfortunately this game works on the idea that the stuff that makes the combat/parkour is locked behind upgrades
[3:45:02] <%RealThiele> LUL
[3:45:02] <hereiam407> Ooooh dogggieeee
[3:45:03] <%RayReborne> omg hes RACING YOU

[3:45:38] <%HotSauceFiend> caught him? with a knife in his neck
[3:45:39] <+Gorgonson> 'caught'
[3:45:40] <+Grayhammatter> CAUGHT
[3:45:40] <cpt_langosta> he was a bandit. he ran, because he was guilty, you know. innocent people don't run.
[3:45:42] <%RayReborne> Ah, chase bandits for parkour xp and items
[3:45:42] <Meltgar> "Caught" Kappa
[3:45:45] <SomeAsianDood> Crime stopped Pog

[3:45:47] <%RealThiele> TAG, YOUR DEAD
[3:45:50] <+Havictos> @Big50boyy if you mean the MC I think some people said they died in the dlc for the first game or something
[3:45:50] <tanarath> IT WAS A GOOD SHOT
[3:45:50] <%VentWilsn> Dying Light 2: Stay Jank
[3:45:52] <Profmcstevie> What a fever dream
[3:45:52] <%Undenizen> I have decided this game is jank. I hope you can find some hilarious bugs
[3:45:54] <%ruben8802> prey slaughtered
[3:45:55] <%CalderGaming> why would a bandit taunt you into chasing him when you didn't notice him before
[3:46:01] <MaybeFalco> im just joining in now, how jank is the jank chat?
[3:46:03] <Hibub277> Oh good we caught him
[3:46:04] <+The_Death_Owl> I'm back are we having funussy?
[3:46:13] <Ciglossonjr> The Joe Rogan Experience?
[3:46:14] <+Nomenanza> god, the player character looks like such a douche
[3:46:24] <AdamDglgmut11> @MaybeFalco it's very jank but in a charming way
[3:46:26] <%RayReborne> use survival sense??
[3:46:27] <%Undenizen> @MaybeFalco i've been watching for like 5 minutes and there's little things everywhere
[3:46:29] <HotMafia81> @Ciglossonjr No, the Goe Rogan Experience
[3:46:30] <+Havictos> @MaybeFalco Gameplay is good Story and voice acting is super jank
[3:46:31] <%RayReborne> idk its around here
[3:46:37] <+KevinsLunchbox> i am just having tons of fun with the narrative dissonance tbh
[3:46:50] <hereiam407> Is he buff

[3:46:52] <SomeAsianDood> jank LUL

[3:46:53] <%rkbinder> too high a level
[3:46:54] <%RayReborne> ah, higher level enemies i guess
[3:46:55] <Tophat12> Is he level 2
[3:46:55] <shotguncrucifix> it has jank armor
[3:46:56] <@Ranryu692> maybe because the couch was in the way?
[3:46:56] <%Caped_Eggy> Hold maybe?
[3:46:57] <%twistedj3ster> I feel crazy, I remember DL1 being 10x better than this...
[3:46:57] <%Undenizen> he wasn't ready for your backstab, pat.
[3:46:58] <+Javaa01> You have low level noodle arms, you need more roids
[3:46:58] <hereiam407> Ohh, super machete

[3:47:26] <shotguncrucifix> this looks like shit
[3:47:26] <+KevinsLunchbox> you performed a takedown?
[3:47:27] <%Undenizen> it's not a stun rod, it's a gd tesla coil
[3:47:31] <%SaiyanShoto> Game took years to come out LUL
[3:47:31] <tanarath> Hold?
[3:47:32] <cpt_langosta> not much of a takedown
[3:47:33] <%Mr_Pylon> Is that a hold or a mash?
[3:47:36] <badguy8312> 10/10
[3:47:37] <PerfectAsymmetry> ???
[3:47:38] <%croxeye> what a crappy takedown lol
[3:47:39] <+Havictos> @PatStaresAt Guess you can just shoot lightning bolts out of your weapon like Thor
[3:47:39] <slimeman420> just tuning, how's the game run so far? I've heard there may be some problems
[3:47:41] <%ruben8802> protect ya neck
[3:47:45] <%RealThiele> ok takedowns too risky
[3:47:55] <hereiam407> Yeh, but you gotta respect it
[3:47:58] <FlaskOfManyThings> YEah
[3:47:59] <+Grayhammatter> it really is
[3:48:00] <+KevinsLunchbox> oh no i get it. you hit the takedown button and the zombie performs the takedown on you. its a suicide button
[3:48:02] <%FingaLights> What a mysterious game
[3:48:02] <Mirrorcatch> it took a lot of health off of it still
[3:48:07] <%RayReborne> idk man
[3:48:08] <cpt_langosta> Get Ready, Elves!
[3:48:09] <FlaskOfManyThings> Use your SURVIVOR SENSE to sniff out the crate?
[3:48:11] <%croxeye> I think the GRE got marked on your map
[3:48:12] <+senpapisweets> too high a level so the takedown is trash I'm guessing
[3:48:12] <bobdoletrasher> @PatStaresAt beard's looking good, pat, keep it up
[3:48:20] <badguy8312> Golden Rexperience Equiem?

[3:49:52] <+KevinsLunchbox> shit
[3:50:00] <%Undenizen> I'm trying not to shit on the game too hard but man the whole setting and tone feels so.... uninspired? it literally just took 3 popular things and mashed them together in the most obvious way
[3:50:03] <+nochejunior> Hans Olo
[3:50:08] <shotguncrucifix> the lockpicking minigame is the worst idea ever. who thought that was ever a good idea
[3:50:17] <+polothegreatest> Fo picklocks doodCrazy

[3:51:08] <+thatotherblackson> ???
[3:51:09] <Ciglossonjr> That is NOT HOW THAT WORKS
[3:51:09] <shotguncrucifix> the booze is an antidote
[3:51:10] <%JonathLP> BOOZE = HEALING
[3:51:12] <+ShinEllison> ...im pretty sure thats not how that works
[3:51:12] <+Havictos> I mean fuck it why not
[3:51:14] <%chiazam> Uhhhh
[3:51:14] <%Big50boyy> ????\

[3:51:21] <VioletRosefall> Booze rules
[3:51:21] <themightyquinn3000> We got any medical experts in chat to clarify that?
[3:51:22] <%CalderGaming> @trackles_64 it's slang for hard liquor
[3:51:23] <PerfectAsymmetry> Yeah...
[3:51:24] <Parapattern> That's...not how that works?!
[3:51:24] <Hibub277> Yummy rocket fuel
[3:51:24] <+KevinsLunchbox> the alcohol will kill the bacteria inside his stomach, like smoking cigarettes. i learned that in always sunny
[3:51:25] <%cade_calrayn> the booze'll make him puke
[3:51:26] <Explodincatz> booze kills water
[3:51:27] <cpt_langosta> this lady's real quick to trust some guy who just shows up and tells her to leave her house with him in it, unguarded.
[3:51:27] <XoftheTITANS> she isnt entirely wrong
[3:51:27] <azure_dunes> flawless logic
[3:51:28] <%G_Thunders> Seriously who the hell wrote this

[3:51:30] <badguy8312> yeah mix alcohol with unknown substances is day 1 med school
[3:51:31] <TheStrongBanana> booze and laughter are the best medicine
[3:51:35] <Mirrorcatch> why is every person so goddamn weird in this
[3:51:40] <%Undenizen> how does that... make sense? if your stomach acid doesn't kill what's in the water, alcohol won't either. sounds more like a metal poinsoning.
[3:51:42] <xxshadowxx416> that so strong booze
[3:51:59] <%DEETRz> hired goons
