[0:16:59] <%InugamiTheHound> dab on woolie's broken hulk doll
[0:17:03] <@StridentSong> It's real fucking bad.
[0:17:05] <Neo_Kaiser> Producer for Rick and Morty died
[0:17:05] <%AncelDeLambert> because they have no souls, of course
[0:17:08] <+DougintheTrench> S*** Launcher, Just like the Epic Game Store.
[0:17:13] <+Grayhammatter> hypocrify yourself
[0:17:13] <%dukenux> Nah.
[0:17:16] <%floralkami> @RubberFistFight that sounds like a painful existence. I'm guessing it's only a small part of the body done?
[0:17:16] <%AncelDeLambert> THE MEMES HURT
[0:17:17] <%ThatOneGameTester> Boarder lands
[0:17:20] <@StridentSong> It's fun mechanically. The writing is atrocious
[0:17:21] <%filialpails> to be fair, you have to have a really high IQ to understand borderlands' humour
[0:17:23] <eiightbiitt> they also have The Room reference the story is shit but the loop is good
[0:17:23] <%BallerSwagBro9k> @stridentsong You bought it on EGS? U monster CD
[0:17:23] <Run44forrest> nah
[0:17:24] <+Grayhammatter> OOF

[0:17:30] <%MrNoobMcSalt> yep
[0:17:32] <%cvp5127> LUL
[0:17:33] <%Saltmeisterr> damn
[0:17:34] <%InugamiTheHound> Buy a user copy from gamestop so Randy can't get any money from it @AngriestPat
[0:17:34] <%cherubs_anonymous> It is fucking caustic
[0:17:35] <+allups> its a good game actually
[0:17:36] <deswescappy> lol
[0:17:36] <%derekwst3> its a slow begining, the ending is more fun but not as great as bl2
[0:17:37] <Run44forrest> goty
[0:17:38] <%SlimeSlimeSlime> That's both funny and sad. =/
[0:17:40] <cureneckbeard> So Bad x24
[0:17:40] <reonome> MEMES
[0:17:40] <%rumtumtugnutz> it's good, but it's not good enough to justify full price.
[0:17:41] <pectusumbra> God I am so glad I missed Boarderlands
[0:17:43] <+allups> yes iu coward
[0:17:45] <+Roundelay11> Yeah, that sounds about right
[0:17:45] <BallinArbiter> Jesus that’s bad
[0:17:46] <%MrNoobMcSalt> sums it up pretty good
[0:17:46] <mybigmeech> The writing in the telltale one was somehow better
[0:17:47] <Valdorick> When you make your game based around streaming culture, yeah, that seems pretty fucking awful.
[0:17:47] <Xxx_wiiuboss_xxx> P A T R I C K B O I V E N
[0:17:47] <%Kduff89> the quest dialogue is actually worse than 2
[0:17:48] <%StaceMcGate> @AngriestPat You still want to play it tho, you want a taste
[0:17:48] <%valriot> That's MASSIVE hyperbole. The dialogue is like 5% of the game.
[0:17:48] <ape_hawk> angry joe basically said "the writing sucks but the shooting good"
[0:17:49] <%griffball13> hello fellow children
[0:17:50] <+Grayhammatter> that's bad
[0:17:51] <MrGreenToS> I beat borderlands 3, I loved the shooting but plot is super cringe. Played with voices off for most of it
[0:17:51] <%InugamiTheHound> Randy Mad x24
[0:17:52] <OuijaTears> you can just turn the audio for characters off
[0:17:53] <KaliasTV> Just go deaf on purpose
[0:17:53] <dmtjinni> Bring CSB OLD LOGO BACK plz @AngriestPat
[0:17:53] <%King_Wolf_Rigger> Pirate the game, donate money to charity.
[0:17:56] <%snow_bush> Hey kids, do you like MEMES
[0:17:56] <+allups> LMAO
[0:17:56] <+ThunderZebraKing> The writing is only bad if you weren't expecting borderlands writing, it felt pretty normal to me
[0:17:58] <wholewheat420> Its not terrible but they're trying to stuff as many memes and jokes as possible
[0:17:58] <+Bigdrifter210> No and i beat the game cant beassed to play it again
[0:17:58] <TwinBat> stream it an torture yourself for money
[0:17:58] <Ids560> yeah if I play through it again I'm definitely muting it
[0:17:59] <%AncelDeLambert> People keep trying to sell Borderlands 3 to me based on the gameplay, to which I always respond "I hate looters, how's the writing?" "Bad." "Oh."
[0:17:59] <wholewheat420> and its rough
[0:18:00] <+AlphaAgito> Shooting and looting is good, everything else is trash
[0:18:00] <%hrudzie_1> i play the game with dialouge on mute lol
[0:18:02] <+Tyonidus> Dude, I really don't get it. It's so fun to just build a build and get legendaries, just ignore it....it's really not all that bad, just play with friends and don't go into it expecting shakespeare....not that complicated guys....
[0:18:03] <%BallerSwagBro9k> The story and writing is ass but the gameplay is amazing
[0:18:03] <OToole42> @AngriestPat the NLSS crew is playing it, and all four players turned voice volume to 0, so they could have fun
[0:18:04] <Zeemod155> You can turn the dialogue off... but yeah
[0:18:05] <+Rezroc> I resented that game long ago
[0:18:06] <viciousgrim> coming to you live LUL
[0:18:06] <%aeonicvector> @mybigmeech because the tales peeople had nothing to lose so had funwith it
[0:18:06] <eiightbiitt> the calypso twins are cringey asf
[0:18:07] <@StridentSong> SSaryn said it best: "I liked X character. Then they kept talking. And kept talking. And kept talking." Each time they talked, it got worse
[0:18:07] <%ThatOneGameTester> My sound design buddy said the sound design was good Kappa
[0:18:08] <%RubberFistFight> @floralkami they cut a nerve in your thoracic cavity. It's not without side effects, as you'd imagine, but it's used for treating people who have hyperhidrosis (aka they uncontrollably sweat in profuse amounts)
[0:18:08] <%NovaKnightmare> you know its funny, Randy Pitchford isnt just an asshole, he also isnt funny either. Its weird how that works
[0:18:09] <%StaceMcGate> Shloot
[0:18:10] <%dukenux> Honestly, Gearbox should hire Telltale people, since TFB is like the ONLY Borderlands property with alright writing @AngriestPat
[0:18:11] <+Roundelay11> Just play more Rage 2 if you want some shoot-bangs
[0:18:11] <Run44forrest> old csb logo was better
[0:18:15] <Bailey__gaming> Just MUTE it I do
[0:18:15] <%rumtumtugnutz> the writing is no worse than borderlands 2.
[0:18:16] <Tucker0603> that sucks cause amara is sexy as hell
[0:18:17] <%Saltmeisterr> YE I CAN DAB
[0:18:19] <%floralkami> @mybigmeech from what I've heard, that's the general consensus for the whole series
[0:18:24] <%primax104> Rejoin us on SS Iceborne! Where the monsters are cool and the writing doesnt matter XD

[0:18:37] <%King_Wolf_Rigger> Northern Lion Super Show.
[0:18:38] <%BarbellGoose> BarbellGoose subscribed with Twitch Prime. They've subscribed for 4 months, currently on a 3 month streak! 
[0:18:38] <%rumtumtugnutz> the problem is, it's kinda just Borderlands 2
[0:18:41] <%valriot> Like that's actually HYPER petty. The dialogue is so infrequent, even if it gets based.
[0:18:41] <%Mrbaconator> Northernlion Live Super Show

[0:18:45] <%dukenux> LUL
[0:18:46] <%derekwst3> my volume was muted, and i listened to @AngriestPat instead
[0:18:48] <%QuadraticGravity> The Northernlion Live Super Show :D
[0:18:51] <Psyramics> Gearbox be like "remember that part of our game that everyone hates? Lets amp it up to 12!"
[0:18:54] <%Monkeyweed21> Your fellow egg Canuck
[0:18:55] <Valdorick> The OG Boomer streamer. Fuck'n Egg.
[0:18:58] <%MightyMaxT> the only NL group I know is newLEGACY
[0:18:59] <%starotter70> And then you slap it
[0:19:00] <%rumtumtugnutz> but, that's just my opinion.
[0:19:00] <%SlimeSlimeSlime> Ouch... Think of all the time and money that went into the script and the voice acting, only to have it muted completely, or to have it be the cause of people dropping the game. =/
[0:19:03] <%AncelDeLambert> your balls must be covered
[0:19:03] <%floralkami> @NovaKnightmare just a lot of shit coming out of that hole. It's all shit, doesn't matter what it was made out of

[0:19:20] <%Nordguy> percussion is fun
[0:19:20] <JetpackMcQuack> wow i hadn't noticed that
[0:19:21] <+Tyonidus> let's be real, the REAL game involves end-game farming where all you're doing is muting the game with music/streams/podcast or youtubes in the background so who cares?
[0:19:21] <Run44forrest> bring the cube back
[0:19:21] <%PaladinDupre> @AngriestPat you didnt put out a tweet when you went live
[0:19:22] <FrankysDream> he's reconfiguring the cube
[0:19:24] <%starotter70> Escape the Crater Pat! You can do it!
[0:19:26] <IncendiumCH> Hey quick question and sorry if this is asked on an hourly basis, but any plans for a Shitstorm with woolie this year?

[0:26:53] <%Bt_Robot> Could you imagine having to hold back playing until you could stream with Woolie?
[0:26:54] <%cherubs_anonymous> People like you enough to watch it
[0:26:55] <prime_name> Arise?
[0:26:55] <%dukenux> So a perfect podcast LP
[0:26:58] <+Seitine> Which is great for stream banter.
[0:26:59] <+Grayhammatter> Deadly P2?
[0:27:03] <%ScreamLord> @AngriestPat I think is would be like the MGSV LP and that was one of the weakest LPs of the old channel
[0:27:04] <%walternatorz> gotta psycho analyze the baby
[0:27:04] <Neo_Kaiser> When's the MGS3 LP?
[0:27:07] <%aeonicvector> Oneshots for sure, LPs can work for like, natural speedrunners
[0:27:07] <%starotter70> I'd probably watch the first episode, then support the rest from the sidelines
[0:27:07] <%SlimeSlimeSlime> Imagine LP'ing Journey?
[0:27:10] <+d00msdaydan> @AngriestPat death stranding LP would basically be a super podcast
[0:27:14] <%floralkami> EXACTLY
[0:27:14] <yourliteraldog> MGS4 LP
[0:27:16] <deviljhojho94> That MGSV playtrough still lives on in legnd....
[0:27:17] <shadowstep1998> hey chat has HADES gotten any updates since pat last played it
[0:27:22] <electricdynamite> me pennyfarts was hilarious
[0:27:24] <%StaceMcGate> cheer500 Pat, as one of the Oldguards of Letsplays, is the anything about the modern landscape of it you just don't understand?
[0:27:24] <+allups> what game?
[0:27:27] <%King_Wolf_Rigger> I fuckin loved that LP
[0:27:30] <%wsintai> @AngriestPat It would cut into his Chaos Legion LP time
[0:27:30] <%Kiiper> Yeah, it would need to be a coop stream like RE2
[0:27:31] <%InugamiTheHound> @AngriestPat could you stream the older MGS games like MGS2 and MGS3??
[0:27:31] <RupanSen> do something together tho :(
[0:27:31] <Run44forrest> bring it back just for deadly premo 2. Super Boomer Friends Play cmon pat please
[0:27:32] <+ZarikGamingStreams> stream it for one day and then just be like ok playing the rest for PAt
[0:27:35] <%Bt_Robot> Also the Bloodbourne LP
[0:27:36] <$Sphincter_Spelunker> Death Stranding @allups
[0:27:37] <%SubjectX07x> I wish I had money to recommend the game Noita to Pat.
[0:27:38] <%Goldenwolf98> Red dead 2 sucks
[0:27:39] <%lethallunacyx> Oh Death Stranding im assuming
[0:27:40] <+ThunderZebraKing> OOF
[0:27:41] <%Piemen99> play that old journey game
[0:27:44] <+Grayhammatter> oof
[0:27:45] <deviljhojho94> yeah same
[0:27:45] <%corepool> yeah
[0:27:47] <%griffball13> it's too much of a simulator
[0:27:50] <%zamzoph> awww, I really like RDR2 FeelsBadMan
[0:27:52] <%dukenux> understandable
[0:27:53] <ShichiNoBushi> Chip Cheezum who has done all the Metal Gear games can probably do a decent edited Death Stranding LP.
[0:27:57] <Caidezes> REALISM
[0:27:57] <CALLthaDoctah> Good thing it's about to come out on PC Kappa
[0:28:02] <+ThunderZebraKing> I hope you scalped the spoilers
[0:28:03] <%Bad1uck> 60 fps
[0:28:03] <+allups> thanks @Sphincter_Spelunker
[0:28:06] <%Zaphire_Saucypants> Yeah...I wanted to enjoy it but goddamn. Felt less like a game and more like work.
[0:28:07] <%ScreamLord> @AngriestPat And then they DOWNGRADED yje graphics for their shitty multiplayer
[0:28:08] <%floralkami> @AngriestPat you really know how to calm his "go go go" attitude with the games he plays, so idk..
[0:28:09] <deviljhojho94> i just got bored like a mouthbreather FeelsBadMan I mock people for that all the time but it happened to me
[0:28:10] <%Bt_Robot> Nobody wanted to do the LP because they wouldn't be able to play the game at their own pace
[0:28:11] <%dukenux> I think R* dissapeared in their ass a little, with this one
[0:28:14] <CyberKN> I traded in Red Dead, got $30 for it
[0:28:14] <%derekwst3> death stranding looks like a game that you would fall asleep watching, but be pleasent playing
[0:28:17] <BallinArbiter> Shame. The story is really good
[0:28:21] <+NeonTurnip> @zamzoph just because pat dont like it dont mean you cant
[0:28:23] <+allups> cant wait for RD2 to come to pc
[0:28:24] <%meltdown547> Loved RDR2.
[0:28:27] <%griffball13> @AngriestPat but horse balls tho
[0:28:28] <eiightbiitt> @angriestpat what console were u playing RDR2 on?
[0:28:31] <artoflec> thats most AAA video games now elaWeird
[0:28:32] <+allups> got spoiled on everrthing but still wanna play it
[0:28:33] <%NeroInfinite> That's pretty accurate to be honest.
[0:28:35] <%dukenux> OH GOD, THANKS PAT
[0:28:35] <%StaceMcGate> massive open worlds don't work with serious stories
[0:28:35] <%InugamiTheHound> I love RDR2 so much. I want to replay RDR2
[0:28:38] <+Shotgundam009> Joke?
[0:28:48] <%dukenux> Housers want to make movies SO BAD
[0:28:48] <DracaenaLeaf> tru
[0:28:50] <+Tyonidus> Yeah the gameplay is always super-average in rockstar
[0:28:50] <Deimos002> pvpPaarl tell me more
[0:28:51] <+CaptainGrime> except for max payne
[0:28:52] <%Ranryu692> true
[0:28:54] <%WAIRIR10R> TRUE
[0:28:57] <%King_Wolf_Rigger> Kojima actually puts in the effort to make the mechanics playable.
[0:28:58] <This_is_Marco> you gotta phone in those inputs
[0:28:58] <%RubberFistFight> @AngriestPat the input lag and framerate have been massively stabilised, it plays at a locked smooth 30 on pro. The animations take forever to complete though and they always have to play through before your next action can execute. It's fucking infuriating when you're gettng shot to pieces and you gotta wait for Arthur to get to his horse, slowwwwwly draw his rifle, turn around and OH YOU'RE DEAD
[0:28:58] <%ScreamLord> Rockstar is Reverse Kojima
[0:28:59] <Run44forrest> so they put crunch time in the game?
[0:29:00] <%InugamiTheHound> The single player mode for GTA5 and RDR2 are quite restrictive
[0:29:00] <BallinArbiter> That’s fair
[0:29:01] <Dementedpenguin> I had so much damn fun playing MGS3:S the first time. I was laughing at my stupid deaths
[0:29:03] <%NeroInfinite> RDR2 was good but I could never replay the damn game
[0:29:04] <jtdobyns> so kajima should team up with rockstar
[0:29:05] <%floralkami> @ShichiNoBushi true, but even being subbed to them, i still be like "sigh" i wanna watch Pat
[0:29:06] <+DrTribal> wasnt a mondo fan stopped playing real quick
[0:29:07] <%Lizard0TM> gtav and rdr2 are pretty ok to play
[0:29:09] <+allups> if the animations are busy work then that kinda hard to do
[0:29:09] <+mugwugsampoo> TRUE
[0:29:15] <%StaceMcGate> Boomers rise up
[0:29:17] <+DrTribal> 10 hrs in
[0:29:25] <%NovaKnightmare> more boomers less zoomers
[0:29:25] <%dukenux> will it be tho?
[0:29:26] <%Futurecity10> eh
[0:29:27] <deviljhojho94> tomatoOld boomer squad
[0:29:30] <yourliteraldog> Will it?
[0:29:30] <%PinkSuprende> PinkSuprende subscribed with Twitch Prime. They've subscribed for 15 months! I'm Commander Supervisor and Fate is the best media on the Citadel
[0:29:31] <%WAIRIR10R> I said the same thing
[0:29:32] <Neo_Kaiser> Have you seen "Rockstar's Game Design is Outdated"?
[0:29:35] <%RubberFistFight> another shot, eh? Coz it's a gun game? Geddit? LUL
[0:29:39] <%King_Wolf_Rigger> I don't think there are any boomer's even near this channel.
[0:29:40] <%Bt_Robot> @AngriestPat Would you cure @PeachSaliva of her Lupus if it meant she would exist at 15fps?
[0:29:41] <%Saltmeisterr> oh man im almost done with this Celeste b side
[0:29:44] <BallinArbiter> Felt fine for me on a regular ps4
[0:29:44] <%MassConnect> can anyone update me on paige's friend's balls?
[0:29:48] <yuggie_the_shark> I liked hunting the bear in Red Dead 2. After I got my hat the game was pretty much over
[0:29:49] <This_is_Marco> I want to climb on my horse but I keep punching it instead
[0:29:49] <$Sphincter_Spelunker> Speaking of boomers, did you know the current generation are called Gen Alpha
[0:29:51] <%starotter70> @RubberFistFight Boooooo
[0:29:51] <%King_Wolf_Rigger> but boomer energy is everywhere.

[0:30:09] <%skizzuto> It's VERY GOOD
[0:30:09] <+thefishofwar> ye
[0:30:09] <Run44forrest> where my doomers at
[0:30:10] <CriminalMasterminds> ye

[0:30:10] <DeliciousPears> No
[0:30:10] <TwinBat> no
[0:30:10] <%dukenux> But it's also HARD AS BALLS
[0:30:10] <Laveyrin> bad game
[0:30:10] <+ThunderZebraKing> Its not bad
[0:30:11] <yourliteraldog> It's pretty goood
[0:30:11] <%primax104> it is hard but good
[0:30:11] <Deimos002> Pretty fun
[0:30:11] <%Archmortal> Celeste is like the best game of its kind?
[0:30:12] <not_twitter_rowan> It's fine
[0:30:13] <+resident4evil05> Yes
[0:30:13] <%Cynful_Zebra> Yes but it's very not for everyone
[0:30:14] <+DougintheTrench> Very Good, Very Hard.
[0:30:14] <%Saltmeisterr> ITS HARD BUT GOOD
[0:30:14] <%StaceMcGate> Celeste is tough but feels rewarding
[0:30:14] <%filialpails> CELESTE SAID TRANS RIGHTS
[0:30:15] <electricdynamite> amazing game
[0:30:15] <%Ghostbody> Yeah, it's fine
[0:30:15] <%aeonicvector> @AngriestPat Superb, but NOT for everyone
[0:30:15] <+valkuma> no
[0:30:15] <%NeroInfinite> Celest is pretty good yes
[0:30:16] <Daxalog> Its oay
[0:30:16] <Run44forrest> its ok
[0:30:16] <marvel877> MIND GOBLINS
[0:30:16] <Valdorick> Its good, but its a platformer, so you know.
[0:30:17] <%BappoSama> It's wonderfully good
[0:30:17] <%InugamiTheHound> @AngriestPat did you hear that ps4 version of COD:MW a entire game mode will be exclusive for whole year WTF!!!
[0:30:17] <cureneckbeard> pat is already crazy
[0:30:19] <%Kiiper> SO GOOD
[0:30:19] <iswearimjustdandy> Yes you idiot
[0:30:20] <%a_c_chirns> I can only play it for like 30 mins or less at a time
[0:30:20] <%RubberFistFight> the morality system is dumb and twisted as shit though - the game considers self-defence to be as bad as (if not worse) than outright cold-blooded murdertheft.
[0:30:21] <%wsintai> @AngriestPat Dawg u already nuts tho
[0:30:21] <%Cynful_Zebra> It drove me crazy too
[0:30:22] <%skizzuto> HARD as balls but worth it imo
[0:30:22] <TwinBat> overrated
[0:30:22] <not_twitter_rowan> But like, there's absolutely a lot of bullshit in it
[0:30:22] <ShichiNoBushi> Well... it's kind of a game about anxiety.
[0:30:22] <Alseid> EXTREMELY OVERRATED
[0:30:23] <Greetings_Gentlemen> are ya bad at games bud?
[0:30:23] <%valriot> It's great but like, it depends how pretentious you're feeling
[0:30:23] <Neo_Kaiser> Celeste is pretty much the same from start to finish
[0:30:24] <%dukenux> Same, but i tried to play it on a keyboard LUL @AngriestPat
[0:30:24] <%Typhaeon> Typhaeon subscribed at Tier 1. They've subscribed for 12 months! Excited to see your first collaboration with Stuart Ashens. Wait no, that's not happening. Oh well, thanks for a year of entertainment anyway.
[0:30:24] <reonome> pat has too many goblins
[0:30:25] <%NeroInfinite> BUT it's bad for the mind goblins
[0:30:25] <iswearimjustdandy> Its the mind goblins
[0:30:26] <roofkie> its like dark souls hard :) :) :)
[0:30:27] <%king_wragles> @AngriestPat it's good, but it does give insight/frenzy
[0:30:27] <%chzoseph> It's literally about mind goblins
[0:30:27] <%DesuDesuDokiDoki> apatGoblin
[0:30:28] <+Caped_Eggy> Not a compelling gameplay for me to watch
[0:30:30] <%primax104> Tough but good. Ending it was fun

[0:31:16] <%QuadraticGravity> THATS NOT WHY THEYRE THERE
[0:31:16] <%primax104> You don't need to bro
[0:31:16] <%wolfofsound> are you not supposed to?

[0:31:26] <%DesuDesuDokiDoki> apatBig apatGoblin
[0:31:26] <%Kiiper> B sides are for later
[0:31:27] <Zeemod155> Pat and optional challenges don't mix
[0:31:27] <%filialpails> those are goblin berries
[0:31:29] <+LastHazzerd> the strawberries don't do anything mechanically or plot wise
[0:31:30] <cureneckbeard> But what if I need the strawberries later
[0:31:30] <yuggie_the_shark> YES HE DOES
[0:31:31] <%Zaphire_Saucypants> you poor miserable wretch.
[0:31:31] <+allups> thats new game plus shit @AngriestPat
[0:31:31] <%Nobrev> strawberries are endgame
[0:31:32] <yourliteraldog> The game mocks your mind goblins
[0:31:33] <%chzoseph> Yes you do
[0:31:33] <$Sphincter_Spelunker> You maybe. Pat does
[0:31:34] <%floralkami> Pat, you gotta get good first

[0:31:45] <%spacehouse> YES
[0:31:46] <%QuadraticGravity> All the time.
[0:31:47] <%Bt_Robot> Take a look at the TAS to see ifthe later levels seem like something you want to do
[0:31:48] <%corepool> apatGoblin apatGoblin
[0:31:48] <%Saltmeisterr> WHAT
[0:31:49] <Ner234> He knows there are optional. The mind goblins don't care.

[0:32:05] <+ZarikGamingStreams> every strawberry not gotten is mocking you

[0:32:17] <+LastHazzerd> strawberries = mario coins, not secret levels
[0:32:20] <%Chichen> kablamzos

[0:34:39] <%RubberFistFight> @wolfofsound that sucks, man. At least they finally treat it like what it is - an immune-moderated cutaneous skin condition. People still go "hurr eat less chocolate and have a better diet" but that actually doesn't change much.

[0:34:51] <a_mad_dragon> oh fuck i had cystic acne too, it was the worst
[0:34:54] <yourliteraldog> My girlfriend try to pick my acne I hate it.
[0:34:54] <%firehawk_420> That’s strange considering your obsession with cleanliness and being a super clean rock man

[0:34:56] <%floralkami> Yes, And how you almost died from it @AngriestPat

[0:35:11] <@lewdskeletor13> Ok that makes sense actually
[0:35:13] <soraabora> who does these things
[0:35:17] <%MassConnect> paige died because she didn't get to see the balls
[0:35:20] <%wolfofsound> @RubberFistFight yeah it's pretty awful, but I have options
[0:35:20] <%Quigsies> They're the same thing conceptually tho?
[0:35:22] <Tucker0603> i sometimes get a cyst in the inside of my mouth that fills with mucus, fucking sucks @angriestpat
[0:35:25] <%dukenux> Then there are plastic surgery shows
[0:35:29] <Dementedpenguin> !!
[0:35:32] <%RubberFistFight> @firehawk_420 fun fact: pathological cystic acne isn't linked to cleanliness the way people think.

[0:36:34] <%demegodz> You made a whole career on them though???
[0:36:34] <%Lizard0TM> because I used to be poor
[0:36:34] <Neo_Kaiser> To get vindicated
[0:36:34] <JonEWorldbeater> The real Pat Stares At was the goblins we made along the way.
[0:36:35] <%skizzuto> because we're too depressed to actually play video games
[0:36:35] <+Anonymasque> OVER WHAT?
[0:36:35] <%chzoseph> It's free real estate
[0:36:37] <DeliciousPears> Same reason we're here. It's nice to watch people bull shit and play games.

[0:36:37] <+alphonseisbest> BOOMER
[0:36:37] <%Archmortal> Personality goes a looooooooong way. Which is why I don't get why people watch pewdiepie
[0:36:38] <+Finalknightmare> better than cable tv
[0:36:38] <@lewdskeletor13> You enjoy the personality of the person playing
[0:36:39] <%merylinspants> lots of reasons. boredom, wanting to see a game, being poor, etc
[0:36:39] <%chzoseph> For YOU!
[0:36:40] <%WAIRIR10R> Too watch the personalities react
[0:36:41] <%Typhaeon> We're just a buncha rubes ain't we
[0:36:41] <cureneckbeard> Because its the only way to watch our cool friend Pat
[0:36:42] <Run44forrest> ok boomer
[0:36:42] <sosuke5> Thank god people do though, right?
[0:36:43] <DracaenaLeaf> Have you ever been te younger brother that watched their sibling play?
[0:36:43] <RupanSen> Because we don't have friends to play with, duh
[0:36:43] <%BLK_HRLQN_13> 0w0
[0:36:43] <%SummonerMagno> its free, and i know which videogames not to buy
[0:36:43] <%aeonicvector> @AngriestPat generally? cant buy games you and woolie reason? Podcast
[0:36:45] <%King_Wolf_Rigger> my reason is comedy
[0:36:46] <%plzdodge> This is why the super best friends broke up I know now
[0:36:46] <%CappuccinoGuil> Look at MISTER MONEYBAGS over here!!!!
[0:36:46] <HollowMan190> HE FINALLY6 SEAID IT
[0:36:46] <yourliteraldog> There is this one show from the UK Called Bizzare Bodies, first episode is about a lady with ass polyps. Shit is on basic cable over there
[0:36:47] <%Agami23> i was the middle child and spent alot of my life watching other people play games. so now i watch dumb youtube men play games.
[0:36:47] <%blastazoid26> Cause its FREE
[0:36:47] <AdmiralButtloaf> free games pat
[0:36:47] <%joylent_blue> I don't watch LPs anymore, streams are much more engaging
[0:36:47] <%AgentOrangeShoes> It's about the player, like three people ever give a fuck about the gameplay
[0:36:48] <artoflec> @AngriestPat its kind of like a podcast on the side with some content im interested in while i work on my main monitor elaSmile
[0:36:49] <OToole42> because it's cheaper to pay a month of internet service, than buy 30 games
[0:36:49] <electricdynamite> biting the hand that feeds
[0:36:49] <%dukenux> Feeling of having gaming friends :)
[0:36:49] <%TDotGoat> because I don't want to play that game, but want to see the story
[0:36:51] <%Conyst> mainly don't have time or money to get games
[0:36:51] <%lethallunacyx> Only losers watch that crap
[0:36:52] <ltbabylucien> It’s something to watch/listen to while I do hw or craft
[0:36:54] <%zamzoph> @AngriestPat vicarious friends FeelsBadMan
[0:36:56] <Captain_Aham> imagine if you could watch entertainers you like watching shit you care about?
[0:36:56] <@lewdskeletor13> It’s no different than Mystery Science Theatre 3000
[0:36:58] <+allups> THE TRUTH COMES OUT
[0:36:59] <%firehawk_420> Because you guys are funny and I get to experience games I otherwise wouldn’t @angriestpat
[0:36:59] <%Divryne> Cause people wanna see other people have the same emoshuns as they did.
[0:37:01] <yourliteraldog> Your like MST3K
[0:37:01] <Brother_Coduss> @AngriestPat because not everyone gets sent games for free to review, and cant afford them
[0:37:03] <cherrycottontail> @AngriestPat This may be a BIG surprise to you Pat, but it's because we like your personality.
[0:37:08] <%dukenux> no surprise here
[0:37:09] <%vectorless_peon> It helps my dog sleep also as a personality you are entertaining
[0:37:10] <%Ranryu692> that makes sense
[0:37:11] <cureneckbeard> I don't like watching people play D&D
[0:37:12] <%wolfofsound> We like the let's players
[0:37:13] <+KrippSubBot> @angriestpat psychologically, it kind of simulates hanging out with a friend
[0:37:16] <3xgilly> honestly pat idk y I'm here either
[0:37:17] <%Quigsies> He's great!
[0:37:21] <@lewdskeletor13> Makes a lot of sense
[0:37:24] <$Sphincter_Spelunker> I'm not ever gonna play the shit Clemps talks about. I love it
[0:37:25] <%derekwst3> @AngriestPat clemps is a sweety baby

[0:37:44] <%joylent_blue> hahaha
[0:37:47] <vonmaultke> @AngriestPat Its about social interaction or the lack of it. That and poverty to check out new titles. There might be more, i dunno.
[0:37:48] <This_is_Marco> youve ruined it
[0:37:49] <%boondoggle42> When were the first videos on Machinima

I like seeing other peoples' takes on things, their path through the game, etc. SBFP was a staple for me because you guys were legitimately hilarious.

[0:38:21] <%BakiinPlaysStuff> it's more about the person playing being entertaining than the game. I enjoy your humor so you could play a shit ass game I would never touch and still be entertained

[0:38:35] <%floralkami> @AngriestPat i can tell you as a poor person growing up fasinated about video games, you guys and your videos pretty much saved my personality development and taught me a lot of things that i now currently hold as dear interests.

[0:41:44] <%CappuccinoGuil> The Jurassic Part Trespasser is AMAZING
[0:41:46] <%floralkami> The fuck are you talking about?
[0:41:46] <@commanderclaw> "The world is tearing itself asunder and I must race"
[0:41:48] <%joylent_blue> nah Arin's problem is that he does try too hard
[0:41:49] <%SilvaChariot0133> Huh!?
[0:41:50] <%rumtumtugnutz> giant bombcast has been kinda insufferable lately
[0:41:50] <+allups> SBF was just super casually and hype ate the same time
[0:41:54] <Neo_Kaiser> AVGN just did Trespasser
[0:41:56] <%NovaKnightmare> are we watching a stream of an LPer watching LPs now????
[0:41:58] <soraabora> i mean the SH1, 2, and 3 ya'll tried and thsoe are great
[0:41:59] <%Nobrev> Do yall remember when Lets Plays were a series of images an descriptive paragraphs on a message board or blog?
[0:42:00] <%a_c_chirns> only 4 mins
[0:42:06] <Run44forrest> how do people still watch game grumps i feel my brain melt
[0:42:08] <%Ranryu692> if it's not one of the former Zaibatsu's LPs, I dont have any interest
[0:42:09] <KilljoyHexx> Here is the thing tho 99% of the time I dont watch LPS...for the LP
[0:42:09] <oneimportantthing> Arin tries too hard and not at all simultaneously
[0:42:10] <RupanSen> I watched the Trespasser LP, still prefer your stuff tbh
[0:42:10] <%NeroInfinite> I know about Tresspasser, that one is golden but sanfrancisco rush thing is forgien to me.

[0:42:31] <+dante_must_die_exe> Kaz went kind'a crazy
[0:42:32] <%ScreamLord> @AngriestPat I think the best LP channels are the ones where the people are the most genuine. Which was why I loved watching SBFP and Game Grumps
[0:42:33] <%PaladinDupre> @AngriestPat ever watch Spoony?

[0:42:51] <%floralkami> Wait, it's only 4 mins...
[0:42:54] <%hawk_rush> creative use of youtube nanotations was the best
[0:42:54] <+StooEsq> He put some effort into that, too bad about YT annotations
[0:42:56] <%Sh00s> that's how LP's started back in the day on forums

[1:01:15] <+allups> every bat man game u cant beat tht
[1:01:16] <@lewdskeletor13> @solidousstream It’s probably to hype up the incoming Batman game

[1:01:19] <%RubberFistFight> @Big_Dream no, el gato is spanish for... THE GATO.
