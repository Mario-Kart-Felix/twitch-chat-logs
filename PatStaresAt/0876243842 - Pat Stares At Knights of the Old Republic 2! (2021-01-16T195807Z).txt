[0:08:04] <%TopsyCretes> must be the noise canceling thing
[0:08:06] <%Bailey__gaming> Good Evening Pat!
[0:08:17] <marvel877> Did Pat get that RTX sound canceling shit to silence Paige or something? The lack of Paige/Elmo/Gief noises feels weird.
[0:08:18] <%X2Eliah> Yeah you BETTER do a spoilercast
[0:08:19] <%mield916> Pat you gonna stream the RE showcase?

[0:08:51] <%MoguManda> it'll sound better once the game starts
[0:08:55] <SupaDanBot> I just got 13 Sentinels! Great game!
[0:08:56] <Diablo169> 999 is great.
[0:09:01] <%Alazull> Also play Zero Time Dilemma
[0:09:02] <+InvisiblessedReptile> Pat is extra Pat today

[0:09:07] <HotMafia81> Pat combed his hair!
[0:09:07] <+Atemisk> morphogenetic fields
[0:09:07] <%Movemeister> Paige vs 999 would be pretty sweet
[0:09:19] <bob900000> how do feel about zero time delema

[0:11:40] <%Fooguwu> It's actually so quiet between talking that I think the stream stopped if you pause for too long
[0:11:40] <%CatastropheCorvid> @PatStaresAt It sounds far too loud, like all the sound is ↑
[0:11:40] <%MrPedrovsky> P A I G E. R E M O V E D.
[0:11:42] <%Fooguwu> it feels awkward
[0:11:42] <marvel877> Not hearing dog snoring or Paige background chitchat feels weird.
[0:11:44] <%cervidaequus> Paige choppy af
[0:11:45] <+InvisiblessedReptile> The sound is almost perfect
[0:11:46] <SaintBeau> KOTOR2 is an amazing game
[0:11:46] <Coystick> CyberPaige 2077
[0:11:49] <oceanmatt> let the mustard queen speak
[0:11:52] <%CatastropheCorvid> Like nearly peaking
[0:11:57] <%X2Eliah> Dog snores?
[0:11:57] <%KeiganOfAstora> Just got here, what did I miss?
[0:11:58] <%MoguManda> you don't want room noise over the game audio, so it's good audio
[0:12:01] <%X2Eliah> Yeeeah
[0:12:02] <DreamCancel01> □
[0:12:05] <Coystick> No snoring is cute
[0:12:09] <%cowardman93> but we want to hear the noises of the animals

[0:12:12] <Explodincatz> I see blue shirt still ruins the stream
[0:12:16] <%cervidaequus> Clean game audio for maximum DMCA
[0:12:19] <drk_sd> it does sound nice
[0:12:19] <%Fooguwu> It turns every silence between sentences into an awkward silence
[0:12:21] <$StrawberryPantsu> AT FIELD?!
[0:12:26] <%shurtal> You're watch a small video of seminal anime movie REDLINE?!?
[0:12:29] <%CatastropheCorvid> I know it's not, it just sounds like nearly peaking. I don't know enough to describe well enough.
[0:12:32] <%Romuken> wish i could put a limit on myself so i didn't peak in high school
[0:12:32] <%MrPedrovsky> Snoring is Integral part of the stream NotLikeThis NotLikeThis NotLikeThis
[0:12:35] <%X2Eliah> You should link an alarm to it, so whenever it peaks it goes a loud BEEEEP
[0:12:40] <Coystick> I need to hear you breathing at all times
[0:12:42] <%BogBodyPositive> a bit
[0:12:43] <+Skelegroove> The background noise of the mic cutting in and out is odd
[0:12:43] <%walternatorz> you mean it's not on purpose?
[0:12:43] <marvel877> A lot. We like the room noise.
[0:12:44] <%KeiganOfAstora> BRRRRRRRRRRRRR
[0:12:45] <%MoguManda> -a-
[0:12:45] <%Alazull> This might be one guy's insanity

[0:12:50] <+AnxietyPrime> just got here, why is it so fucking quiet when Pat isn't talking
[0:12:50] <drk_sd> the limiter just squashes it

[0:13:18] <%cervidaequus> Want to hear paige bantz
[0:13:19] <%X2Eliah> so sad

[0:13:22] <commanderapathy> who else but paige
[0:13:25] <prettygoodatstuff> Paige suffering is part of the deal
[0:13:26] <ToneBacas> we hardly knew her
[0:13:28] <@SoFarFetched> @MonsterGills its pats shirt,it changes the color of the camera he moves a certain way

[0:13:41] <%Broand> paige sounds like she's trying to escape from a sound consuming black hole
[0:13:43] <axtonunbound> taking notes from bean dad now?
[0:13:47] <marvel877> Paige will have to suffer in silence then...
[0:13:48] <$StrawberryPantsu> YEP

[0:14:16] <+Seitine> You just don’t want us to hear you fart anymore.
[0:14:16] <%CatastropheCorvid> @PatStaresAt I think what it is, is all the sound is elevated. I'm listening on headphones, and it seems like smaller sounds are all diminished, but louder sounds are all super loud. (Sorry I'lkl stop @ing now.)
[0:14:17] <drk_sd> witchcracft

[0:14:42] <bob900000> yup
[0:14:42] <%arancet> pats wearing that shirt that ruins all the colors again
[0:14:43] <@SoFarFetched> yeah
[0:14:44] <ToneBacas> ye
[0:14:44] <%X2Eliah> Can you delay it for like 0.5 seconds so it's crazy hard for you to speak?
[0:14:46] <%KeiganOfAstora> Barely
[0:14:47] <%abakkus> very distant, quiet echo
[0:14:48] <scrumbotime> wow and the MOMENT it stops, the echo DISAPPEARS
[0:14:50] <+Atemisk> thats pretty neat
[0:14:53] <%Undenizen> no pat. you sound like a crazy person

[0:15:04] <%KeiganOfAstora> You mean FarFetched fixed it? @PatStaresAt
[0:15:04] <marvel877> But we liked it Pat.
[0:15:06] <%MrPedrovsky> @patstaresat We hear only when you talk
[0:15:10] <+MoguManda> everyone clap
[0:15:12] <prettygoodatstuff> especially for one so easily disoriented
[0:15:13] <%BogBodyPositive> distorienting
[0:15:15] <%cowardman93> it's the WORST
[0:15:18] <scrumbotime> !Pat At Risk!
[0:15:18] <%ChrisPlaysThing> Thats a crowd dispersal weapon actually

[0:43:34] <+cowardman93> that's bullshit
[0:43:35] <%Teintstein> that's fucking dumb
[0:43:36] <Aydarkzero> yay!
[0:43:36] <%AmanisHouseOfNonsense> that sounds like the big dumb
[0:43:37] <abelincoln_catpuncher> woooowww
[0:43:38] <%TrafficCohen> Fuck that
[0:43:39] <%Sotetsu> I hate EGS so much
[0:43:40] <FutaSnek> IS... is this on consle too
[0:43:40] <lets_be_friendos> console users don't have that problem right?
[0:43:41] <marvel877> that sucks
[0:43:42] <%X2Eliah> you have to rebuy an older game just to import a savegame????
[0:43:42] <ammobasket> oof
[0:43:44] <+MrH00dz> 10/10 flawless system
[0:43:46] <%Huntercd> Like buy for free? or buy?
[0:43:46] <Kirbachev> It's a fucking pity how badly they've mucked up the Hitman series, because the base game concepts and mechanics are seriously a ton of fun.
[0:43:48] <dekkitout> tajWHY Does Epic gamestore even have a cart yet?
[0:43:48] <%AncelDeLambert> I've played Blood Money, and THAT'S IT because every other property in the series has fucked me over in one way or another
[0:43:50] <%cvp5127> thanks epic
[0:43:51] <Profmcstevie> The save data is here, but the receipt is not on my doorstep :)
[0:43:52] <$bigfastkaratedealership> Fuck seriously?
[0:43:55] <@SSaryn> THIS IS THE WORST ONE.
[0:43:57] <Aydarkzero> well said Pat
[0:43:57] <%ChestMimik> It comes out 2021 duh
[0:43:58] <%Teintstein> sounds like brand marketing and product didn't talk and ended up shitting the bed
[0:44:00] <%X2Eliah> Jesus that's like forcing ppl to buy the old mass effects to make the new ones work
[0:44:00] <+vaderxyz1970> Himan 3 2022
[0:44:01] <Kirbachev> @dekkitout Hilariously, no
[0:44:01] <%Movemeister> LUL
[0:44:06] <@SSaryn> In terms of exclusivity, this is actually the worst one.
[0:44:06] <Spudnacious_Dynasty> Moving save files is TOO DIFFICULT
[0:44:07] <AnneSQF> i always delay Epic exclusives in my brain
[0:44:07] <+gimmickypizza> Personal computer problems
[0:44:10] <ToneBacas> can't wait for Hitman 3 to come out next year
[0:44:15] <%BallerSwagBro9k> Yup that's what im doing
[0:44:16] <FutaSnek> Its really fucking fun
[0:44:19] <+reallybigrocks> Wait but the description for Hitman 3 mentions being able to bring stuff over from other platforms? You really have to buy Hitman 2 on EGS for that to work?
[0:44:22] <DreamCancel01> "Its the worst it's ever been"
[0:44:22] <Profmcstevie> Consume product is worst part of product, fucking hell
[0:44:24] <lets_be_friendos> i waited for the 2 gold edition and got it for $30
[0:44:25] <@commanderclaw> Don't you love CHARTS
[0:44:25] <%AncelDeLambert> this is a running theme with Hitman at this point
[0:44:27] <%ChestMimik> Hitman's numbering is almost worse than Kingdon hearts'
[0:44:29] <%X2Eliah> So Epic Store vs Origin, which is worse?
[0:44:34] <icyjiub> so just like cyberpunk
[0:44:36] <%AncelDeLambert> Hitman games are GREAT, IF you can get them and get them to work
[0:44:37] <+MrH00dz> Trying to set up the game IS the Real game !
[0:44:42] <%cowardman93> EGS was a mistake NotLikeThis
[0:44:43] <wembleyttv> Just make a main hitman game!
[0:44:47] <baahstin> big oof
[0:44:49] <FutaSnek> Hitman is what I wish Assassins Creed turned into rather then open world schlock
[0:44:50] <%BallerSwagBro9k> Its really ez on Steam
[0:44:57] <ToneBacas> @wembleyttv it's a main game
[0:44:59] <Kirbachev> @FutaSnek I know, right? As games they're legit good. The way they've handled this shit has done nothing but tarnish legit good work.
[0:45:01] <%Sotetsu> I usually skip an EGS delayed game, even when it comes out on steam, because fuck those companies for agreeing to it.
[0:45:06] <%Dunmarkh> psaWhat
[0:45:08] <+reallybigrocks> Then that isn't really bringing it from other platforms, what a load of bullshit
[0:45:13] <lets_be_friendos> i hope the james bond game won't be so complicated when it comes out in 3-5 years
[0:45:16] <nivlac_555> boop his snoot
[0:45:28] <%cylish> @cowardman93 No it was a successful creation designed to steal your money
[0:45:35] <@SoFarFetched> up, up ,down, down,chu,chu,chu!
[0:45:48] <DreamCancel01> Nose tapping is effective too
[0:45:53] <FutaSnek> Let them know it hurt at least
[0:45:55] <%MrPedrovsky> Never touched New Hitman. Making Story mode Timed play it or miss it missions Made me not touch it because of FOMO. And not getting full campaign story because I didn’t play it non stop since release and that content is forever gone
[0:45:57] <%Teintstein> both negative and positive reinforcement
[0:46:02] <%Undenizen> you started with "ball up your fist" and i was expecting "break their bones fairly quickly"
[0:46:05] <wembleyttv> @ToneBacas I just not a fan of episodic stuff. I just want blood money again not like Absolution
[0:46:09] <Kirbachev> @lets_be_friendos Enjoy your Daniel Craig base skin, with Pierce Brosnan skin being DLC and Sean Connery being a pre-order bonus to "honour his memory". Calling it now.
[0:46:14] <%AmanisHouseOfNonsense> Oh shit, I never noticed the stream timer

[0:46:35] <%Maids4lyfe> stream timer!?
[0:46:39] <+reallybigrocks> I guess the fact that Hitman 2 is going to be 80% off for a while is a bit of a consolation but man fuck that

[0:51:04] <%ElectricEmissary> I mean we just made channukah into getting presents too
[0:51:05] <%Sotetsu> Christmas isn't about religion anymore
[0:51:07] <%SirFancySwank> doesnt hanakuah do gifts as well
[0:51:08] <%ElectricEmissary> they do suck tho
[0:51:10] <abelincoln_catpuncher> LUL LUL LUL LUL
[0:51:11] <%KeiganOfAstora> Chanukah is Christmas for us. It's the same thing you idiots
[0:51:12] <%Dunmarkh> LUL

[0:51:51] <Gruhunchously> Chanukah presents are fine, man. You get chocolate coins.
[0:51:53] <%bigfastkaratedealership> so youre saying Hanukah = more gifts but shit quality?
[0:51:53] <%Undenizen> @ElectricEmissary what a combo
[0:51:54] <%Maids4lyfe> I'd rather get socks than a pencil case
[0:51:55] <Profmcstevie> Nobody screams NINTENDO 64 on Hanukkah I tell you wut
[0:51:56] <%KeiganOfAstora> As kids maybe, but as adults it's just Jewish Xmas
[0:51:56] <%TheMattman1313> Something like dividing 1 Xmas gift into 8 smaller gifts because people stated comparing it to Xmas

[0:59:50] <%cowardman93> FUCK THAT
[0:59:51] <@SSaryn> That sounds like shit
[0:59:51] <%dekkitout> *Blank* graft aint pretty
[0:59:52] <%MrPedrovsky> @ssaryn So basically no reason to do it? When do monsters unlock that was released as updates? Fuck if i know what they are but only saw Rajang spoiled so far for me
[0:59:52] <%bigfastkaratedealership> replacement tooth bone?
[0:59:52] <%Romuken> so you have more bone than you did before? I see why Paige likes you then
[0:59:53] <%KeiganOfAstora> is that fun?
[0:59:53] <socratetris> All of your brother stories make me feel better about my shitty older brother
[1:00:01] <%sakeydo> Woolies playing Naruto again. Lol
[1:00:01] <+PaladinDupre> My Uncle has that but more
[1:00:02] <MillaMoks> @PatStaresAt I sympathize and empathize with you and anyone else who has had extreme dental pain/issues. My wisdom teeth were so bad before they were removed that opening my mouth to full extension would dislocate my jaw. And getting the wisdom teeth removed was a whole different adventure in problems (and thats one of my less bad teeth experiences).
[1:00:03] <mike2hands> Fffffuuuuvk
[1:00:03] <%Sotetsu> Are implanted teeth easier to deal with once everything is done?
[1:00:04] <%KeiganOfAstora> Graph or Graft?
[1:00:06] <%shieldecho> Yep, been through that, it is not a fun.
[1:00:07] <%ElectricEmissary> LUL putting it lightly
[1:00:08] <PanicSwytch> I was 10 yrs old, My brother Tombstoned me on my bed...I got so dizzy that i fell from the bed and cracked my skull on my dresser
[1:00:10] <%Movemeister> Pat is well on the way to transitioning into a toilet
[1:00:10] <CSeriesJTYPE> worse than kidney stones?
[1:00:12] <%Bt_Robot> Just get a cybernetic Predator jaw
[1:00:13] <%Undenizen> i had upper and lower jaw surgery. it wasn't great!
[1:00:14] <Coystick> Become Bone
[1:00:16] <%dekkitout> Sounds like root canal on NG+ 4
[1:00:16] <%X2Eliah> Is it attaching artificial bone, or transplanting from another place?
[1:00:17] <%ttc_lover> Where did the bone come from?
[1:00:18] <%BogBodyPositive> Do you still like your brother?
[1:00:20] <+reallybigrocks> Bone graft sounds fuckin awful
[1:00:21] <%Ipsenscastle> wtf is wrong with Woolie, why is he like this
[1:00:22] <ShichiNoBushi> I hear donating marrow is also pretty harsh.
[1:00:23] <%emperordread> So you're not going to graft on an exo-skeleton for Paige on your wedding night?
[1:00:25] <%cylish> personal top pain so far is appendicitis + catheter while awake
[1:00:26] <$thomassolorio> man karma's gunna fuck your brother up
[1:00:31] <%Maids4lyfe> you have a fuck ton of nerves
[1:00:33] <%ScreamLord> No wonder you're so pissed all the time
[1:00:34] <DexteraXIII> Bone Giraffe?
[1:00:34] <socratetris> return to bone
[1:00:35] <@SSaryn> @MrPedrovsky Well one of the main things is, Tempered DLC monsters give you your Rarity 13 upgrades, so that's the only thing you actually need to worry about.
[1:00:37] <%KeiganOfAstora> Yay science lesson!
[1:00:38] <%cowardman93> jesus god
[1:00:40] <%brickwall35> shouldn't you be thankful your brother rid you of gross organic material and replaced with clean manmade material?
[1:00:53] <%Puhff> This is my nightmare
[1:00:57] <%Sotetsu> So your mouth is the bone zone
[1:00:57] <%X2Eliah> MAN FUCK NERVE 3

[1:01:40] <%MrH00dz> That's a pretty strong debuff
[1:01:41] <Coystick> Based bones
[1:01:47] <@SSaryn> @MrPedrovsky Get Rank 7 in the Guiding Lands to get those Tempered Monsters to spawn in their respective areas.

[1:01:57] <BerryliciousDefinition> AHHHHHHHH
[1:01:57] <Psyramics> no, this was a DeWalt
[1:01:57] <%shieldecho> I have four of those!
[1:02:01] <ShichiNoBushi> I recall this is also the origin of your compulsion to cover your mouth when you eat.
[1:02:01] <%BogBodyPositive> why didn't they knock you out???
[1:02:02] <+reallybigrocks> They bust out the Dremmel
[1:02:05] <Profmcstevie> heavy Duty
[1:02:09] <%Bt_Robot> reminds me of when I broke my jaw and had to get plastic surgery to repair my upper lip when I was six.
[1:02:09] <%dekkitout> I'm assuming it didn't smell nice
[1:02:11] <abelincoln_catpuncher> but you still feel iiiiit
[1:02:11] <%cowardman93> a lot more surgeries than you think use legitimate power tools

[1:02:37] <$StrawberryPantsu> I hate that smell
[1:02:37] <%Bt_Robot> it's frightening
[1:02:37] <%shieldecho> Also just the sound in general, not great.
[1:02:37] <socratetris> @bogbodypositive Grafts take a long time to grow. Cant be unconscious for weeks
[1:02:38] <%brickwall35> did it smell good?
[1:02:38] <%baka_sugoi> sbfpUno sbfpUno sbfpUno
[1:02:39] <%X2Eliah> Also you feel the vibration
[1:02:41] <BerryliciousDefinition> Oh my god
[1:02:42] <%Teintstein> I remember that from when my wisdom teeth were taken out
[1:02:43] <%KeiganOfAstora> that means they aren't vacuuming it out well enouogh
[1:02:43] <i_am_therydon> keep going
[1:02:44] <%MelBrooksKA> Sorry what?
[1:02:45] <AShinyVagikarp> Anosmiacs FTW
[1:02:48] <%cylish> I feel like the psych damage that can cause would warrent going under
[1:02:51] <$TheOfficialNeens> its the most disgustingsmell ever
[1:02:52] <+BallerSwagBro9k> UUUGH
[1:02:53] <%shieldecho> Yeah it's pretty easy
[1:02:53] <%Sotetsu> What a crazy experience.
[1:02:55] <Tina_Skellybutt> lego teeth
[1:02:55] <+MrKawaiiDessu> The burning smell hits different when you are the fuel
[1:02:56] <%Teintstein> just like legos
[1:02:59] <%shieldecho> IT SURE DOES
[1:03:02] <%BogBodyPositive> @socratetris no no I meant for the drilling
[1:03:04] <%KeiganOfAstora> So before you got the new ones, did you have oddly shaped front teeth?
[1:03:05] <%Teintstein> jesus christ
[1:03:06] <%MrH00dz> Welp I'm adding a new thing on my "MAKE SURE TO AVOID" list
[1:03:10] <%Sotetsu> We're you streaming?
[1:03:11] <%MrPedrovsky> @ssaryn So title update monsters are all tempered? And grind ALL areas to 7 to unlock? Don’t tell me what they are. Doing it blind and only saw a Picture of normal Rajang on twitter but not anyone else
[1:03:12] <$thomassolorio> your brother is quite the kane to your able no wonder you were so angry
[1:03:17] <+BallerSwagBro9k> @mrkawaiidessu PUT THAT ON SHIRT. ILL BUY IT
[1:03:19] <%dekkitout> Impacted molars sometimes need the drill
[1:03:20] <socratetris> @bogbodypositive oh! okay, gotcha
[1:03:24] <%Teintstein> like little white pants on a wire
[1:03:28] <abelincoln_catpuncher> jesus
[1:03:41] <%KeiganOfAstora> Good way to lose weight
[1:03:45] <%cowardman93> oh that's why you do that
[1:03:45] <$StrawberryPantsu> SO THAT'S WHY!?
[1:03:46] <%Maids4lyfe> yeah that'll do it
[1:03:47] <%Sasha_conyst> all pat wanted for Christmas was his two front teeth
[1:03:50] <bob900000> yeah
[1:03:50] <%brickwall35> goblin origins revealed
[1:03:50] <%Teintstein> secret snacks
[1:03:50] <%Sotetsu> That is a very Japanese gesture
[1:03:53] <Coystick> I got a porcelain veneer front tooth like one of those, they whittled my broken tooth down to a plug shape and fused it on with some super ultra mega glue.
[1:03:55] <%cowardman93> yeah that'll ingrain
[1:03:58] <%X2Eliah> THANKS BRO
[1:03:58] <%baronblank> wow, this is some good pat lore
[1:04:00] <%wibbwobbler> that plus the rest of the injury is insane 2 think about
[1:04:02] <BerryliciousDefinition> Huh
[1:04:04] <%Maids4lyfe> learned behaviors are hard as fuck to stop
[1:04:04] <%Teintstein> btw pat your camera is infrequently doing that thing where it switches from warm to cool tone
[1:04:05] <%bhp_99> I do that without the trauma
[1:04:05] <abelincoln_catpuncher> is this the original of the mind goblins??
[1:04:07] <@SSaryn> @MrPedrovsky Essentially, if you want any of your Rarity 13 weapons, you HAVE to get their respective Tempered materials from them which means getting that area to Level 7. So make sure to do some research after you've done that said monster.
[1:04:12] <%Top_Lane_Duelist> not all that bad of a quirk, kinda polite
[1:04:14] <mike2hands> So that’s why you’re embarrased to eat in public
[1:04:17] <%W1nterTitan> Thanks, Pats brother
[1:04:17] <@SoFarFetched> @Teintstein its because of his shirt when he moves
[1:04:17] <%arancet> didnt hear about the ordeal installing them were
[1:04:22] <%BallerSwagBro9k> PAT IS A JAPANESE WAIFU?
[1:04:23] <%MrH00dz> lol
[1:04:23] <UncleOliver> i think i remember the smell thing but not the rest
[1:04:26] <abelincoln_catpuncher> lmao fair enough
[1:04:26] <%KeiganOfAstora> He was born with Mind Goblins
[1:04:27] <%dekkitout> The mind goblins are kekkei genkai
[1:04:28] <+MrKawaiiDessu> @BallerSwagBro9k ngl I though that my sudden testicular torsion comment is more marketable but fair dinkum
[1:04:29] <mike2hands> I honestly would do the same
[1:04:29] <%SirFancySwank> that was birth
[1:04:29] <$thomassolorio> my first time hearing about this
[1:04:30] <%Teintstein> @SoFarFetched ahhhh that makes sense
[1:04:31] <bob900000> brother
[1:04:34] <%cowardman93> everyone has mind goblins
[1:04:35] <Coystick> The goblins whispered to him in the womb
[1:04:37] <bigshedman> Born in the goblins
[1:04:38] <%brickwall35> this is just one specific goblin
[1:04:38] <+OG_M_Bison> They knocked me out when they did my bone graf and implant
[1:04:41] <%Huntercd> Pat the sith
[1:04:41] <%bigfastkaratedealership> mind goblin genetic curse
[1:04:43] <%baka_sugoi> psaGoblin psaGoblin psaGoblin
[1:04:45] <abelincoln_catpuncher> the mind goblins are bloodline techniques
[1:04:45] <+reallybigrocks> These mind goblins have been passed down the Boivin line for generations
[1:04:46] <%KeiganOfAstora> Maternal though, hmmm
[1:04:48] <PanicSwytch> YEARS OLD GOBLINS BREEDING
[1:04:48] <inkandamber> What is a "Mind Goblin"? Mental health issues?
[1:04:49] <ShichiNoBushi> Prehistoric mind goblins.
[1:04:49] <thelonechris> Do they just move from one head into the other?
[1:04:54] <%ElectricEmissary> oh yeah red head
[1:04:54] <%ChrisPlaysThing> Mine are from Trauma psaDab
[1:05:00] <%emperordread> I thought the mind goblins came from the pie-cutting incidents psaGoblin
[1:05:00] <@SoFarFetched> They brapped in your face?
[1:05:01] <%dekkitout> Da gas gas gas
[1:05:02] <%X2Eliah> Full anesthesia is kinda scary
[1:05:03] <Coystick> Gingers are resistant to drugs
[1:05:03] <+D00msDayDan> i've heard this story several times and it my mouth sympathy hurts every time
[1:05:04] <+rdark_ksu> gas is cool
[1:05:04] <+MrKawaiiDessu> Ah yes, because da ginger
[1:05:05] <ohfricktrig> jerma GAS
[1:05:07] <%X2Eliah> because you can just die
[1:05:07] <shieldecho> I had so much anesthetic that I felt it in my eyeball
[1:05:10] <inkandamber> Nitrous is SO GOOOOOD
[1:05:10] <%arancet> nitrous makes you not give a SHIT
[1:05:13] <%baka_sugoi> D R U G S psaUp
[1:05:14] <+fromnibelheim> nitrous is the shit I had a great time during my root canal from it lmfao
[1:05:14] <%MrPedrovsky> @ssaryn Cool. Thanks. But I don’t care about gear. Just want to see new monsters that i know exist somewhere post story and stuff
[1:05:17] <%brickwall35> this is a whippit-supporting channel
[1:05:18] <ChungusQuest> "Don't do drugs, kids, but if you HAVE TO choose..."
[1:05:20] <SupaDanBot> Guess feels a-okay
[1:05:25] <%dekkitout> Virgin novocain, Chad NO2
[1:05:25] <%ElectricEmissary> you still feel i t yeah
[1:05:25] <+LionKagura> They gave you the brap
[1:05:26] <Profmcstevie> My family has a DELAYED reaction to anaesthetic on my fathers side, I sure do feel a bit when I shouldn't
[1:05:28] <%X2Eliah> Don't do drugs, kids, do gas
[1:05:32] <%shieldecho> Too much anesthetic doesn't numb so much as just make you go WELL THIS IS WRONG AND BAD
[1:05:34] <ShichiNoBushi> Gaaaas gaaass GAAAAS! Hit me with the gas, TONIGHT!
[1:05:36] <abelincoln_catpuncher> @inkandamber it's what Pat calls his internal OCDs, as little mind goblins yelling at him
[1:05:37] <%Blank9> I've only had the injection anasthetics for a knee surgery, but good lord seeing it happen and not feeling it was crazy.
[1:05:38] <%Teintstein> the gas is fun but there's not much that can make you not notice the pressure they use when fuckign around in your mouth
[1:05:41] <+D00msDayDan> remember kids, do drugs
[1:05:42] <%brickwall35> kids love whippits
[1:05:44] <%Razputin217> Give me a taste of the GOOD SHIT
[1:05:46] <inkandamber> They use it as a muscle relaxant. I needed it when I had a bad bough of sciatica
[1:05:51] <%kewlmyc> The gas didn't work on me. Was fully aware and awake the whole time during my wisdom teeth removal
[1:05:53] <+reallybigrocks> Ooh they hit me with the gas when I had to get some teeth pulled when I was young and I was flipping shit and it didn't do shit
[1:06:12] <inkandamber> @abelincoln_catpuncher Ah, that makes sense.
[1:06:12] <@SoFarFetched> this was a fun hour
[1:06:19] <%dekkitout> Feeling teeth getting yoinked out, but not feeling pain was an interesting experience
[1:06:19] <@SoFarFetched> STREAM OVER
[1:06:19] <%cowardman93> this just makes me glad my wisdom teeth came through
[1:06:22] <+MrKawaiiDessu> Lets just say fuck it and make scopolamine the default pain res drug
[1:06:24] <%arancet> i need nitrous for virtually every dentist visit or the anciety fucks me up hard
[1:06:26] <+MrKawaiiDessu> what could go wrong
[1:06:29] <%brickwall35> Pat was kinda flashing his ball area there for a sec
[1:06:30] <@SSaryn> @MrPedrovsky Fair enough, if you wanna do the research that's definitely up to you, hope you keep up and get to the ending.
[1:06:33] <%X2Eliah> Good stream 10/10 see you next week
[1:06:34] <+reallybigrocks> Stream over everyone go home
[1:06:44] <@SoFarFetched> @arancet I thought that said "or the ancients fuck me up hard"
[1:06:45] <Coystick> You know if Pat's not back in 15 minutes legally we're allowed to leave
[1:06:51] <+reallybigrocks> wait you're all already home? shit
[1:07:05] <@SoFarFetched> and wondered what kind of dentist you visit where the ancients fuck you up LUL
[1:07:15] <%X2Eliah> So is that 15 minute thing actually real?
[1:07:23] <%arancet> @SoFarFetched eh, 6 of 1, half a dozen of the other
[1:07:26] <%Alazull> Chat is at the number of the beast
[1:07:27] <%X2Eliah> I remember we had that rumour for sure in school
[1:07:28] <%brickwall35> no

[1:07:30] <+MrKawaiiDessu> The canuck is gone, fellow brits its time to rise up
[1:07:34] <%MrPedrovsky> @ssaryn I basically just Hunting Horned through entire game without looking at gear. Besides getting horn maestro and Health Up. Just finished Iceborne and unlocked the lands. So if all “new” content is behind Lands grind i guess i will just go right now and hunt random shit while watching Pat play KoTor2
[1:07:46] <%ChestMimik> @X2Eliah Technically no, in the sense that you're "legally allowed to leave" at any time
[1:07:52] <abelincoln_catpuncher> lmao these pre stream discussions in Woolie and Pat's streams are pretty great ngl
[1:07:56] <+reallybigrocks> I remember people saying that 15 minute thing in college like they couldn't just leave whenever they wanted anyway
[1:08:02] <%abakkus> @X2Eliah no idea if its a law, persay, but all my college profs have honored it since its such a widespread concept
[1:08:44] <@SSaryn> @MrPedrovsky Hope you love HH in Rise too, shit's great so far.
[1:08:44] <%MrPedrovsky> psaDab
[1:09:05] <+reallybigrocks> College professors generally don't give a shit beyond reminding you that you're the one paying thousands of dollars for an education and if you wanna waste your money that's on you

[1:10:04] <%MrPedrovsky> @ssaryn No interest in Switch at all. No nintendo childhood in Russia. So getting it only for MH is worthless. Nevery touched nintendo stuff at all. Only console i could eventually afford was PS1 while ps2 was the hot shit
[1:10:32] <%MrH00dz> Ohhh PS2 was the bomb !
[1:10:35] <%X2Eliah> Hmm
[1:10:52] <+MrKawaiiDessu> I literally have a switch only for RPGs ngl @MrPedrovsky
[1:11:02] <%X2Eliah> PogChamp
[1:11:12] <%X2Eliah> I wonder who's that
[1:11:21] <DreamCancel01> I only planned to get a switch for smt nocturne
[1:11:33] <@SSaryn> @MrPedrovsky Ah fair enough, hope you still enjoy getting all the World goodness.
[1:11:34] <%MrPedrovsky> I would rather buy PS5 than switch. More bang for buck
[1:11:52] <%X2Eliah> Aren't PS5s out of stock still?
[1:12:10] <discozombi> Yeah
[1:12:15] <%MrH00dz> Yeah, PS4/5 has some really great exclusives worth buying for
[1:12:17] <+MrKawaiiDessu> If you havent got a PS5 yet then your refresh tech needs work

[1:18:59] <%MrPedrovsky> @ssaryn Sorry to bother. But i would like a last piece of advice from you. And sorry for not googling. Don’t want to get spoiled. My question is: Should i kill or capture in the Guiding lands or just do whatever????
[1:19:00] <%MrH00dz> A T-pose ?!?! In MY KOTOR !?!?!
[1:19:15] <%X2Eliah> A jeeeeeee-day

[1:19:16] <$SwagglesMD> Dance Pat
[1:19:22] <%ChestMimik> @MrPedrovsky Not the same guy, but Caps usually get you more resources
[1:19:30] <Gruhunchously> What are you going to do to capture a Jedi, eh?
[1:19:31] <+OG_M_Bison> You can play ranged jedi too :)
[1:19:35] <+Mindtrick_Matt> Bare fist Jedi is amazing
[1:19:37] <subjectg> You can go unarmed and it actually works
[1:19:53] <Coystick> Ranged Jedi=GUN WIZARD
[1:19:54] <subjectg> i just wish they gave you handmaiden’s echani feats
[1:19:55] <Gruhunchously> This would be a lot different if you had your lightsaber equipped
[1:19:55] <ToneBacas> but do you take advantage of that replay value, as in, do you not play the same character all the time?
[1:19:56] <%MrPedrovsky> @chestmimik Ok thanks. Gonna go in there for the first time right now
[1:20:17] <ChungusQuest> is that so?
[1:20:21] <Gruhunchously> Gun Jedi is actually really cool
[1:20:38] <%MrH00dz> I forgot, do you look like a dried out desert sand surface when full dark side in this KOTOR as well ?
[1:20:42] <Gruhunchously> WHERE IS THE MANAGER!?
[1:20:48] <%megaman_sentinel> her face has cleared up wat happened
[1:20:49] <redrins> an echo... in force
[1:20:51] <Gruhunchously> Yes
[1:20:55] <+Mindtrick_Matt> Do repeater blasters work in this? Or is that just a Kotor 1 issue?
[1:21:02] <%ChestMimik> @MrPedrovsky Happy hunting!
[1:21:03] <subjectg> @megaman_sentinel goth gf happened
[1:21:09] <%X2Eliah> theres no echo
[1:21:10] <+OG_M_Bison> There's a lot of different kinds of roleplay you can do as the character
[1:21:15] <%MrPedrovsky> @patstaresat There is still an Echo Pat. Or more like a wound. In the force

[1:23:51] <%Romuken> JUSTICE?!
[1:23:57] <%MrH00dz> I think yes
[1:23:58] <Zulrez> cause that always bothered me when i played the first game
[1:24:04] <jtsoppy137> JJJJ.... JUSTICE
[1:24:13] <%Fooguwu> @Zulrez but then how are you to twirl them constantly
[1:24:15] <%dekkitout> It's like every 6 years we games this tight
[1:24:17] <%NopeBadguy> WAKE UP TO JUSTICE
[1:24:19] <%SirFancySwank> just ice he needs to keep his drink cool
[1:24:21] <subjectg> @zulrez this game has two weapon slots, just leave the other one unarmed
[1:24:21] <%MechArch> nah man just ice
[1:24:23] <%MrH00dz> I'd swear I saw a mod for that on nexus/steam workshop
[1:24:23] <Coystick> ...mmmm nah NV is a tier above KOTOR if only because its more mechanically meaty
[1:24:23] <%X2Eliah> New vegas... Hm. How about that recent fallout space game, Outer Worlds?
[1:24:25] <+D00msDayDan> how about justice later
[1:24:29] <bigshedman> Use the blaster rifle to farm
[1:24:33] <%Romuken> space racism?
[1:24:33] <%GarbageNirvana> Do we mean justice or JUSTIS

[1:25:03] <%GarbageNirvana> Outer Worlds is a proof of concept, that's it
[1:25:11] <%MrH00dz> Gundark ? Then turn on a light
[1:25:16] <+Mindtrick_Matt> I think New Vega's open world holds it back for me, I dont like exploring the Mojave much
[1:25:19] <%MrH00dz> Kappa
[1:25:24] <Coystick> Gundark sounds like a boomer shooter
[1:25:35] <Zulrez> @Fooguwu fuck, you're right
[1:25:36] <%maenos2> I get moisture farming on tatooine but why here
[1:25:42] <+OG_M_Bison> I love just walking around the Mojave. One of the best parts of New Vegas easily
[1:25:42] <Gruhunchously> Gundarks are those things that Obi-Wan fell into a nest of that one time.
[1:25:45] <%logoth_> salvager salvager salvager
[1:25:45] <+OG_M_Bison> @Mindtrick_Matt
[1:25:46] <%Romuken> maybe it's derogatory?

[1:25:59] <+D00msDayDan> hey fattypigdog, and zangief
[1:25:59] <%X2Eliah> I remember getting real annoyed when I tried going North when starting to play New Vegas, and the game was like "nope"
[1:26:01] <%GarbageNirvana> Why's this guy sound like Christan Slater
[1:26:05] <%Daxalog> I like how Water is such a constant thing they have to worry about. Like Moisture Farms
[1:26:10] <%dekkitout> Speaking of NV, The Frontier mod is finally out
[1:26:15] <Gruhunchously> These guns are actually really good. And they scale to your level @PatStaresAt
[1:26:30] <+OG_M_Bison> LUL
[1:26:31] <%maenos2> helping is it's own reward. money too.
[1:26:32] <ToneBacas> Chaotic Neutral then?
[1:26:43] <Gruhunchously> @PatStaresAt The actual guns change depending on what level you're at.
[1:26:50] <GustauveVIII> is pat gonna traitor or is pat gonna go straight mercenary?
[1:27:07] <%MrH00dz> Visas is looking at me
[1:27:08] <Broken_Sonex> Oh yeah, this fuck.
[1:27:09] <%Alazull> We're too poor to hire a robot to do this job
[1:27:13] <%MrH00dz> I kinda like it
[1:27:14] <subjectg> @patstaresat the guns themselves get better, you have to be specific level ranges to get specific rewards
[1:27:16] <%MechArch> visas just chillin
[1:27:21] <%GarbageNirvana> Visas over here waiting for the kill command
[1:27:22] <Gruhunchously> Visas is staring into your soul
[1:27:27] <Gruhunchously> So to speak
[1:27:31] <%Ancopro> doesn't afraid even
[1:27:37] <%X2Eliah> So is darth Karen like an instant-dark-side-decision, or the slow string-em-along-and-betray-in-the-end?
[1:27:41] <Gruhunchously> "You want me to kill him, Master?"
[1:27:47] <%MrH00dz> Well might be literally, since she does see with the force
[1:27:51] <+OG_M_Bison> Implying Visas can see FailFish

[1:28:40] <Broken_Sonex> Visas is giving him the check. Making him sweat!
[1:28:58] <%GarbageNirvana> Karen would totally snitch
[1:29:07] <Gruhunchously> A bad feeling, you might say?
[1:29:13] <%dekkitout> Snitching can be weaponized by Karens, but it can easily backfire
[1:29:13] <%X2Eliah> Dantooine IS a shithole
[1:29:14] <%Manjove> so let me get this straight, you are sneaking around behind someones back to get them fired for percieved slights.
[1:29:15] <CSeriesJTYPE> who's Don Tooine
[1:29:15] <%MrH00dz> @OG_M_Bison She CAN see... she just doesn't have eyes. duh Kappa
[1:29:18] <+VexicBayn> The old galactic republic does not have the American policy of "no snitchin'"
[1:29:23] <%Dementedpenguin> yeye, came home to some kotor2.
[1:29:37] <+OG_M_Bison> @MrH00dz You need eyes to see tho

[1:30:19] <@commanderclaw> Do it Kae'Ryn
[1:30:19] <%Alazull> Pat will be scouring the surface of life, one murder at a time
[1:30:20] <Gruhunchously> Hey, we're not goign to stop you. Kreia might get pissed, but that ship already sailed.
[1:30:21] <+VexicBayn> but the women too

[1:30:26] <+VexicBayn> AND THE CHILDREN
[1:30:27] <KaitlynnHere> BURN IT DOWN
[1:30:33] <%dekkitout> What you'll do will make what Malok did be a small fit by comparison
[1:30:33] <%NopeBadguy> are you talking about earth
[1:30:36] <%X2Eliah> "An empty Galaxy is a peaceful galaxy"
[1:30:36] <%NopeBadguy> Kappa
[1:30:50] <+Shiso666> until it is done
[1:31:08] <Gruhunchously> Remember that murder mystery from the first game?
[1:31:15] <%Dementedpenguin> I want a jedi detective game now
[1:31:16] <%SirFancySwank> lol reference
[1:31:25] <+jmcclellan18> He is
[1:31:25] <@commanderclaw> He's the legit worst
[1:31:28] <%Maids4lyfe> he is
[1:31:28] <Sapphire_Breeze> Vrook is a bitch
[1:31:31] <%BallerSwagBro9k> KILL VROOK SUPER HARD
[1:31:33] <+OG_M_Bison> Would Darth Nihilus go hungry if he ate every planet in the universe?
[1:31:34] <Gruhunchously> he is the WORST
[1:31:34] <%X2Eliah> yep
[1:31:38] <AnacondaVirtue> He's a dipshit
[1:31:40] <abelincoln_catpuncher> Vrook is why people turn to the dark side
[1:31:40] <@commanderclaw> He's the cause of everything wrong with the Jedi Council
[1:31:42] <+VexicBayn> "Ed Asner couldn't be more of an asshole"
[1:31:45] <%dekkitout> He is. He's like Lawful Good-Evil
[1:31:48] <available_line> he's full Boomer
[1:31:49] <%X2Eliah> VROOK IS YOUR REFERENCE JEDI
[1:31:49] <Ookamiden02> yup
[1:31:50] <+vaderxyz1970> Vrook is very close to red if you look at him with kriea
[1:31:59] <Gruhunchously> At least Atris has the justification of being totally nuts.
[1:32:03] <Broken_Sonex> VROOK IS THE ULTIMATE FUCK HEAD!!!!
[1:32:05] <+Mindtrick_Matt> A worst Mace Windu
[1:32:07] <+VexicBayn> Y'all see that Ed Asner counterstrike meme?
[1:32:09] <KaitlynnHere> he has the biggest stick up his righteous butthole
[1:32:10] <%dekkitout> He's textbook prequel movie Jedi
[1:32:11] <Ookamiden02> He is villain in our hearts
[1:32:32] <%Alazull> He's terrible because he uses hindsight to justify the actions that caused things to go horribly wrong
[1:32:34] <Sapphire_Breeze> dew it
[1:32:37] <%Dementedpenguin> I mean. Talking about Jedis in the Star Wars universe always seems to be a depressing subject LUL
[1:32:40] <Gruhunchously> Vrook is just an asshole through and through
[1:32:45] <+OG_M_Bison> At least Kavar admitted they fucked up
[1:32:47] <%Romuken> kekekekekek
[1:32:47] <%MrH00dz> I don't like Vrook, he's smug aura mocks me
[1:32:50] <KeiPrime> sounds just like him
[1:32:54] <+D00msDayDan> wow just like politics
[1:32:59] <KaitlynnHere> @dementedpenguin cults are depressing
[1:33:11] <%Dementedpenguin> @KaitlynnHere LUL
[1:33:11] <%Huntercd> Space Italian?
[1:33:13] <rjhascancer> maklunky
[1:33:19] <%BallerSwagBro9k> Mclunky
[1:33:32] <%X2Eliah> Literally anything these aliens say, just means "i shot first tho"
[1:33:33] <Gruhunchously> @PatStaresAt I almost want to see you spare Vrook just so we can see the full extent of his assholery.
[1:33:44] <%MrH00dz> lol
[1:33:47] <KeiPrime> maklunki adept robe
[1:33:59] <Goodvibes99508> good shit but raid the temple first
[1:34:01] <subjectg> Very good for unga bunga builds
[1:34:03] <@commanderclaw> It's the 2nd best Phsical build robe in the game I think
[1:34:10] <+OG_M_Bison> @Gruhunchously Vrook somehow even pulls a BIGGER DICK MOVE later on
[1:34:13] <+OG_M_Bison> If he lives
[1:34:19] <ChungusQuest> But does the robe look cool??
[1:34:30] <%dekkitout> Vrook's caucacity is awe inspiring
[1:34:38] <%MrH00dz> @ChungusQuest Asking the REAL question here
[1:34:40] <%GarbageNirvana> Vinesauce has ruined maclunkey for me thanks to his AI Dungeon streams
[1:34:41] <%SirFancySwank> high crit is the only good crit
[1:34:53] <Goodvibes99508> there might be a custom disruption rifle named the Droid assassina rifle
[1:34:57] <ShichiNoBushi> Kay'Rehn: "Did you just say 'maklunky' at me? I demand to see your manager." Rodian: "This is my shop."
[1:35:05] <i_am_therydon> pat why are you not looking disgusting?
[1:35:08] <Gruhunchously> But GUNS through
[1:35:13] <%Divryne> Perish scum.
[1:35:22] <Goodvibes99508> its end game drops
[1:35:23] <Sapphire_Breeze> BIG guns
[1:35:24] <+Mindtrick_Matt> Probably random like most things in this
[1:35:26] <Gruhunchously> @ShichiNoBushi I AM the manager!
[1:35:27] <subjectg> @patstaresat you get it as a guarantee later
[1:35:42] <+OG_M_Bison> Militia is my favorite character
[1:35:43] <Sapphire_Breeze> Zherron's voice is great
[1:35:59] <%GarbageNirvana> What is stretching but a momentary T-pose
[1:35:59] <+Mindtrick_Matt> and its on Mobile now!
[1:36:00] <%dekkitout> AND MODS
[1:36:01] <%BallerSwagBro9k> LUL
[1:36:01] <%X2Eliah> But it's so janky
[1:36:02] <Aydarkzero> nice
[1:36:03] <%Dementedpenguin> Buy it to spite Pat. Kappa
[1:36:05] <%SirFancySwank> i thought miltia was his name for a moment
[1:36:06] <+Mindtrick_Matt> you can even mod it on mobile
[1:36:06] <%Alazull> $10 normal price on Steam
[1:36:06] <%Sotetsu> What mods do you use?
[1:36:06] <bigshedman> How long is a playthrough?
[1:36:09] <%Aluminar> batman
[1:36:12] <+OG_M_Bison> You can be darkside and get the lightside ending
[1:36:12] <SupaDanBot> Very good gamu
[1:36:15] <+jmcclellan18> HEY LOOK ITS DAVIK KANG from KOTOR 1
[1:36:16] <KaitlynnHere> Every now it’s on even sale too
[1:36:18] <%Bt_Robot> Also, Disruptor would only be second to slug thrower for HK's favorite gun, mainly because of the painful death they cause.
[1:36:19] <%maenos2> sounds kinda like sten in Dragon age
[1:36:20] <DatAsuna> But not if you click the stickied comment on the last wvs kotor episode lol
[1:36:24] <%El_GhostV1> Hacket out
[1:36:31] <Gruhunchously> There is. THe amount of content they managed to cram into a 14 month dev cycle is honestly pretty impressive.
[1:36:31] <polaris6679> I gargle sandpaper
[1:36:34] <%X2Eliah> THAT GUY IS DOING ASMR WRONG
[1:36:35] <%Sotetsu> Should you play Kotor 1 first?
[1:36:39] <%dekkitout> Sounds like a Morrowind Dark Elf
[1:36:43] <rjhascancer> OOF THAT VOICE
[1:36:43] <%MrH00dz> For real tho, why does Kaeryns face not look like the moons surface right about now ? I'm sure pats close to full dark side right ?
[1:36:51] <ChungusQuest> that's a whiskey voice
[1:36:53] <%Bt_Robot> Painful and lingering, so he can enjoy the kill
[1:36:53] <subjectg> “You want something, n’wah?”
[1:36:54] <+jmcclellan18> Yes, def play Kotor 1 first
[1:36:55] <KaitlynnHere> @polaris6679 smoke sandpaper cigarettes
[1:36:55] <%Daxalog> You can still buy it and play a gun playthrough. Though it probably wont be that cool.
[1:36:57] <+OG_M_Bison> @maenos2 Yea he does. Dragon Age O is another really good rpg
[1:36:57] <OldManDeckardCain> "OY BOBBY, DO THE VOICE AGAIN BUT LESS HUMAN THIS TIME"
[1:37:02] <%MrH00dz> *gruff man noises intesnify*
[1:37:02] <+Mindtrick_Matt> I think the NPC faces are a huge improvement over Kotor 1
[1:37:03] <dinnydanny777> Only need ten voice actors if they can all do multiple bad voices Kappa
[1:37:07] <+OG_M_Bison> Fuck Dragon Age 2 and Inquisition tho
[1:37:08] <+Raiden_Breaker> Mr Mumble
[1:37:11] <%GarbageNirvana> He did a light side thing once to fuck with alignments I think
[1:37:14] <Coystick> Add option "why are you talking like that?"
[1:37:15] <Broken_Sonex> Man Woolie’s light later excuse was SUCH bullshit.
[1:37:20] <%Daxalog> That must be murder on the throat
[1:37:21] <%X2Eliah> Dragon age 2 has its charms
[1:37:26] <%Huntercd> He had to be nice to Visas
[1:37:30] <%MrH00dz> @OG_M_Bison Them are fighting words mate
[1:37:35] <Gruhunchously> @MrH00dz Becasue she was nice to Visas. Literally. That's the reason.
[1:37:36] <+Mindtrick_Matt> @OG_M_Bison Inquistion is good its just full of needless filler
[1:37:36] <%GarbageNirvana> That's it
[1:37:38] <+jmcclellan18> Pat have you ever played Jade Empire?
[1:37:50] <%Alazull> Android version is also a cool $10
[1:37:52] <bigshedman> Isn't Kotor1 on Steam?
[1:37:52] <+OG_M_Bison> Wait people actually like Dragon Age 2 unironically?
[1:37:55] <KaitlynnHere> It’s on all da mobiles
[1:37:56] <DatAsuna> or just screen mirror it to your tv
[1:37:58] <%Broand> Really? the android versaion?
[1:38:00] <+OG_M_Bison> I know Inquisition has redeeming qualities
[1:38:01] <+CatastropheCorvid> Is there not a GOG version?
[1:38:03] <KeiPrime> man jade empires is fuckin weird fromwhat i remember
[1:38:06] <%CatastropheCorvid> Of KOTOR 1?
[1:38:09] <%Puhff> ...Android?
[1:38:10] <DatAsuna> Android version has controller and mod support, no extra steps needed
[1:38:12] <%MrH00dz> lol is that intentional or a bug ? @Gruhunchously
[1:38:13] <DatAsuna> GOG version sucks
[1:38:19] <%CatastropheCorvid> I thought GOG had one.
[1:38:19] <Sapphire_Breeze> @bigshedman it is but some people have tech issues with it
[1:38:25] <+VexicBayn> didn't another brand new android version JUST come out?
[1:38:26] <%CatastropheCorvid> Oh. TIL.
[1:38:37] <%CatastropheCorvid> Not sure which version I played then.
[1:38:39] <bigshedman> @Sapphire_Breeze Ah, I see.
[1:38:41] <DatAsuna> there are widescreen mods but they're janky and don't upres
[1:38:42] <+OG_M_Bison> Can you patch Kotor 1 steam version @PatStaresAt
[1:38:42] <+Raiden_Breaker> man I just bought the GOG version NotLikeThis
[1:38:43] <%Alazull> Android version is good and requires minimal work to make it better
[1:38:44] <KaitlynnHere> Just fix it
[1:38:47] <%Puhff> Yeah Jade Empire when?
[1:38:47] <%SirFancySwank> thats what mods are for i guess
[1:38:54] <+Mindtrick_Matt> You can get it on Xbox as well
[1:39:00] <+RSNoon> Never had any issues with the steam version
[1:39:02] <Gruhunchously> @MrH00dz By being nice to Visas, she managed to raise her alignment from 'moon dust face' to 'slightly discolored face'.
[1:39:05] <%templar010> Jade Empire is fucking lit
[1:39:06] <dinnydanny777> Is this voice actor just growling into the mic
[1:39:07] <DatAsuna> yes but only for widescreen and sometimes it just fails half the time
[1:39:21] <+OG_M_Bison> @RSNoon I tried streaming the steam version and that shit was broke too hell
[1:39:23] <DatAsuna> jade empire android port is sadly unsupporting past android 6.0
[1:39:24] <%Divryne> Yarr harr I love the high seas.
[1:39:25] <+VexicBayn> @mindtrick_matt unfortunately you can't get restored content mods on Xbox rip
[1:39:29] <%MrH00dz> omg that's hilarious LUL
[1:39:33] <KeiPrime> aint theres a fighting style in jade empire thats just gun?
[1:39:33] <%Maids4lyfe> the voice actor sounds like he's barely awake
[1:39:40] <%dekkitout> He sounds like he conspires to expose the lies of Vivec and the Tribunal SeriousSloth
[1:39:46] <%Maids4lyfe> like he needs some coffee, or meth
[1:39:47] <+Mindtrick_Matt> Dont really need mods for Kotor 1 honestly.
[1:39:50] <%pseudomonkey23> jade empire is fantastic
[1:40:04] <Broken_Sonex> This guy is like if someone was speaking using throat singing
[1:40:12] <%Maids4lyfe> half his words sound mumbled
[1:40:23] <+OG_M_Bison> This dude uses his throat to talk more than the Dutch LUL

[1:45:30] <EuropanLamprey> Every time Pat reloads, it's just Darth Karen using Force Bites Za Dust
[1:45:39] <+OG_M_Bison> The lie requires a higher persuade I guess
[1:45:42] <OldManDeckardCain> if you think about it, it's not pat's fault a karen has no charisma
[1:45:42] <Gruhunchously> I guess he smelled the smell of LIES
[1:46:07] <SilverFaustX> i just ordered 13 sentinels it was on sale :)
[1:47:04] <%MrH00dz> psaBig Suspicious
[1:47:07] <Gruhunchously> So you can snitch and then counter-snitch
[1:47:13] <%Broand> Talk to his manager
[1:47:33] <%kewlmyc> I'll like to speak to the manager
[1:47:33] <$IDGJohn> Counter snitching is the new meta
[1:47:40] <+OG_M_Bison> LUL
[1:47:45] <+OG_M_Bison> FULL KAREN PLAYTHROUGH
[1:47:47] <Gruhunchously> She is his manager though
[1:47:51] <%MrH00dz> Shits locked
[1:47:51] <%SGrim> This is Kah'ren's ways
[1:48:02] <Gruhunchously> Some of these doors will open later in the story quest
[1:48:15] <%Fooguwu> at the bottom of his leggies
[1:48:18] <+nazzynoeyes> HKs feets
[1:48:19] <TheLazerPanther> show feats
[1:48:20] <%Alazull> Go ahead and call the Republic peace keeping forces on them
[1:48:21] <%ladomania> you can see his feets right there
[1:48:31] <SilverFaustX> he named her karen ?
[1:48:35] <+D00msDayDan> show feats
[1:48:43] <Gruhunchously> It's okay, the team you're rolling with is totally down with murder.
[1:48:43] <%Alazull> @D00msDayDan Kae'ryn
[1:48:44] <%X2Eliah> Why you care about his feets? what are you, Reggie?
[1:48:53] <SilverFaustX> lol
[1:48:58] <%MrH00dz> I like how everyone insults the Ship
[1:49:03] <%dekkitout> Are we still doing phrasing/
[1:49:05] <+nazzynoeyes> Why isn't there a quest in which HK asks you to attach human feet to him?
[1:49:14] <Gruhunchously> This is Mon Mothma's VA
[1:49:25] <Gruhunchously> Also, Dr. Chackwas from Mass Effect
[1:49:36] <%Puhff> Why do so many people on Dantooine have grey skin???
[1:49:38] <%OfficioPrefectusCorgi> that Voice sounds farmiler
[1:49:44] <%Alazull> Mon Mothma's actress?
[1:49:44] <+OG_M_Bison> Dr. Chackwas = GILF Kreygasm
[1:49:47] <%maenos2> doctor chakras!
[1:49:55] <%maenos2> chakwas
[1:50:06] <%X2Eliah> @Puhff Maybe something wrong with the local sun
[1:50:11] <+OG_M_Bison> @Puhff Cause everyone is depressed as shit
[1:50:12] <%THATGUY_789> I'm late to the party, is pat going to watch the resident evil showcase chat?
[1:50:20] <%MrH00dz> Dr. Chocolates Kreygasm
[1:50:22] <Broken_Sonex> She's pretty nice looking ngl
[1:50:22] <%maenos2> yes
[1:50:33] <%X2Eliah> he said yes
[1:50:41] <+vehementvadr> no it's right now totally
[1:50:46] <%THATGUY_789> ok cheers
[1:50:46] <Cyphereous> The showcase is next week, but the thirst for tall vampire woman is now.
[1:51:06] <+OG_M_Bison> That tall vampire mommy was really hot tho
[1:51:15] <+VexicBayn> Don Two Ween
[1:51:16] <%X2Eliah> Dan Tootin'
[1:51:19] <Gruhunchously> That's kind of a Star Wars tradition dating back to the original movies.
[1:51:20] <Broken_Sonex> DONNY DAN
[1:51:26] <+nazzynoeyes> That tall vampire momma is gonna bag that game GOTY <3
[1:51:41] <%MrH00dz> Dan the teen
[1:51:42] <+vehementvadr> snoop dog says dizil tantoonizel
[1:51:44] <%Alazull> Will the Resident Evil showcase be when the tall vampire lady can step on me?
[1:51:54] <+OG_M_Bison> I think Chris hunting down another man for their sperm to impregnate his sister will win it game of the year LUL
[1:52:03] <Gruhunchously> See, speaking to the manager works!
[1:52:04] <ShichiNoBushi> Kae'Ryn: "My type? What do you mean by THAT!?"
[1:52:10] <%Alazull> SNITCH
[1:52:22] <+OG_M_Bison> That sounds like nothing out of context LUL
[1:52:23] <Broken_Sonex> To be fair, she was VERY tall. And VERY hot and VERY vampire.
[1:52:26] <%X2Eliah> wow
[1:52:27] <%Alazull> Remember, if they come after you for it you snitch on them again
[1:52:37] <%X2Eliah> so she just ignorees it, huh
[1:52:41] <%FacetiousAF> only some?
[1:52:53] <%MrH00dz> Nobody believes you... honestly very accurate for Karens lol
[1:52:54] <+OG_M_Bison> Unless you can find more evidence
[1:52:56] <+OG_M_Bison> Maybe?
[1:53:32] <Broken_Sonex> Oh wow, and actually manager
[1:53:38] <%Alazull> I mean would you believe a Karen?
[1:53:40] <Broken_Sonex> actual*
[1:53:55] <Arbal3st> The Great Sith Hero!
[1:54:01] <%THATGUY_789> ahh that's why I was confused, had a live notification for showcase for 8am and didn't read the date. tee hee
[1:54:09] <%dekkitout> In short, "eh..."
[1:54:19] <Broken_Sonex> What a hero, that evil sith was
[1:54:31] <%Huntercd> Who we killing first?
[1:54:44] <wembleyttv> NGL I hated this place in the 1st game
[1:55:10] <%Alazull> I mean Revan and Malek were great heroes of the Republic...before they showed up to conquer it
[1:55:17] <Broken_Sonex> @wembleyttv It was kind of a drag, yead
[1:55:28] <Broken_Sonex> yeah*
[1:55:38] <%THATGUY_789> so Karen's pest control
[1:55:38] <%MrH00dz> You gotta love how Star wars is basically the Sith shitting the bed, the Jedi cleaning it and the rest complaining the Jedi didn't clean it good enough.
[1:55:52] <%Alazull> Hey, who's that walking corpse?
[1:56:17] <Gruhunchously> @MrH00dz Well, half the time, the Sith shitting the bed are ex-Jedi.
[1:56:22] <%Alazull> @MrH00dz Art imitates life
[1:57:40] <%Undenizen> why does this man have a fake black guy voice?
[1:57:44] <%MrH00dz> I mean, if I had to hear the constant moans of all the NPC's as a jedi, I would lose it too
[1:57:45] <+OG_M_Bison> Also the jedi do a TERRIBLE job of preparing for Sith attacks
[1:57:52] <Broken_Sonex> Wasn't this guy black in the console versions?
[1:57:52] <+OG_M_Bison> Also the jedi are usually assholes
[1:58:11] <subjectg> he was
[1:58:28] <+OG_M_Bison> White washing mrfrog3S
[1:58:35] <Broken_Sonex> Ah. Explains the voice.
[1:58:36] <%dekkitout> This mfkr sounds jive as shit
[1:58:42] <%Undenizen> Did they make him white because of *problems*?
[1:58:50] <Gruhunchously> @PatStaresAt In order to get extra outcomes for this quest, you need to get Bao Dur in the party.
[1:59:10] <%Alazull> If Evil now not possible, Evil later
[1:59:10] <GustauveVIII> bao dur probably has most influence gain/loss on dantooine
[1:59:13] <+OG_M_Bison> It'll boost your relationship with Bao Dur tho I think
[1:59:19] <+OG_M_Bison> Yea when you turn in
[1:59:31] <Gruhunchously> @PatStaresAt You need Bao Dur when you actually find the sensors
[1:59:37] <%MrH00dz> I remember a crystal cave on this planet. It has been a forever since I played this but I think there was
[1:59:40] <+OG_M_Bison> Wait some people were saying you can lose Influence too tho
[1:59:53] <+nazzynoeyes> Pissy AND shit bitchy? Woah
[2:00:13] <%Undenizen> I don't wanna backseat mod or anything, but for anyone joining chat, we're doing a LOW INFLUENCE run.
[2:00:14] <Gruhunchously> Also, i think you can still lose influence with him if you call him a little bitch
[2:00:22] <%dekkitout> woolieMINHMAX
[2:00:32] <Arbal3st> dont give in to the gremlins
[2:00:37] <%Ascethetic> just cheat your influence
[2:00:41] <%MrH00dz> AH THERE IT IS
[2:00:44] <%X2Eliah> You do you, pat
[2:00:48] <Broken_Sonex> One is, yes
[2:00:48] <Gruhunchously> Er...yea
[2:00:49] <GustauveVIII> @PatStaresAt Sensors are inside, yes.
[2:00:51] <%MrH00dz> My memory has not failed me
[2:00:52] <+OG_M_Bison> I'd hope there's an option to punch Bao in the balls at lease LUL
[2:00:58] <Sapphire_Breeze> I think so
[2:00:59] <%NopeBadguy> this game kinda drives you to minmax to finish all the storylines for companions
[2:01:00] <$realm_forge> Pat’s Karen is that one very rare yet very dangerous Karen sub type that turns everyone around them into bastards just by proximity
[2:01:01] <GustauveVIII> @PatStaresAt they're actually very close to entrance
[2:01:21] <Broken_Sonex> I think the sensor is the first thing you can pick up in there
[2:01:35] <%Undenizen> @OG_M_Bison I'd love it if everyone constantly just had a "punch in the balls" option that did nothing but lower your influence.
[2:01:46] <%MrH00dz> haha
[2:02:13] <%MrH00dz> Every RPG needs that
[2:02:21] <%baronblank> so by the end, basically everyone on the team will be a good guy besides the protag and like HK?
[2:02:35] <+OG_M_Bison> The conversation with that dude is FUCKING GREAT
[2:02:40] <%ScreamLord> @PatStaresAt Don't you call 'em a bitch anyways?
[2:02:55] <Broken_Sonex> @baronblank And Visas will be a simp for Karen.
[2:03:00] <+OG_M_Bison> @OG_M_Bison That's one thing Mass Effect did right LUL
[2:03:06] <Arbal3st> shut up bao, we're doing it
[2:03:15] <LoveXKnife> les go
[2:03:21] <%MrH00dz> Visas was a simp before it was hip
[2:03:23] <%Alazull> SKill option
[2:03:26] <Gruhunchously> Do it
[2:03:36] <%AzureGale> FOR SCIENCE
[2:03:39] <+OG_M_Bison> mrfrog3EZ
[2:03:42] <Gorgs7> shoulda quicksaved just for interests sake
[2:03:56] <Broken_Sonex> @MrH00dz You know, Visas is the ultimate simp, when you think about it.
[2:04:02] <Gorgs7> I don't remember what those things are
[2:04:10] <+OG_M_Bison> @MrH00dz 100%
[2:04:31] <%MassConnect> Whose balls got punched in Mass Effect?
[2:04:44] <%MrH00dz> Conrads
[2:04:55] <subjectg> i just remembered there’s a guy you can fuck over super hard in this cave
[2:04:57] <RedSqurrl> just that one
[2:05:01] <%bhp_99> Who do you plan on corrupting in the playthrough?
[2:05:06] <+OG_M_Bison> @MassConnect She didn't have balls but the reporter. Also Shepard threatened to rip someones balls off and feed them to a Krogan
[2:05:07] <Gruhunchously> @PatStaresAt So basically, the sensor have surveillance devices in them. If you discovered that, it would be evidence you could give to the administrator to get Zherron fired from his job.
[2:05:09] <Broken_Sonex> I just shot Conrad in the foot.
[2:05:28] <%MrH00dz> @OG_M_Bison Ahhhh good times
[2:05:34] <Gruhunchously> @PatStaresAt I have no idea
[2:05:57] <+OG_M_Bison> Ah Renegade Mass Effect playthroughs. Where Shepard is a dick for no FUCKING REASON LUL
[2:05:59] <RedSqurrl> Do eeeet
[2:06:09] <%MrH00dz> Renegade Shep is best Shep...
[2:06:24] <Gorgs7> @PatStaresAt I think the evilest is usually to follow through the quest until it's end, finding everything, then just say "fuck you, chump"
[2:06:27] <subjectg> where’s the letterbox?
[2:06:50] <Broken_Sonex> @OG_M_Bison Renegade in my opinion was just not being an idealistic idiot.
[2:06:54] <Gruhunchously> If G0-T0 was here, he could haggle 5000 credits out of him.
[2:06:55] <%AzureGale> You gotta know when to hold 'em
[2:06:57] <OldManDeckardCain> some random obsidian dev after watching this lp: "Huh, I didn't know you could be hated this much in our own game..."
[2:07:13] <+OG_M_Bison> Renegade Shep = psychopath, racist, and a sociopath
[2:07:16] <Gruhunchously> Fair enough.
[2:07:24] <Broken_Sonex> It's a good team, to have.
[2:07:26] <%Maids4lyfe> LUL
[2:07:31] <Arbal3st> cant go wrong with killbot and sith bae
[2:07:32] <+OG_M_Bison> @OG_M_Bison Renegade Shep is racist and kills innocent people LUL
[2:07:42] <Broken_Sonex> Murder robot and Goth PAWG
[2:07:47] <Gruhunchously> Yeah, they will suck your dick. Both of them. At the same time.
[2:07:53] <%MassConnect> Renegade Shep did nothing wrong
[2:08:00] <Coystick> Tags: Mindbreak
[2:08:11] <%MrH00dz> Well that's why you don't go full renegade, you never go full renegade. Only the cool options
[2:08:14] <+OG_M_Bison> Paragon shep is OVERLY Idealistic but Renegade Shep is TOO MUCH OF AN ASSHOLE FOR NO REASON
[2:08:17] <OldManDeckardCain> yall hating because renegade shep is based and red pilled Kappa
[2:08:32] <%Maids4lyfe> lol
[2:08:33] <+OG_M_Bison> @MrH00dz Then that's not renegade Shep
[2:08:36] <Broken_Sonex> @Coystick Visas' favourite tag.
[2:08:38] <+OG_M_Bison> That's neutral Shep
[2:08:43] <%MrH00dz> Full renegade screws over Wrex... unacceptable
[2:08:54] <subjectg> they do, very slowly
[2:08:57] <Gorgs7> no, that's the only downside to using HK
[2:08:58] <GustauveVIII> @PATSTARESAT If any of your party members fall, you can revive them by attempting to transition to another area.
[2:09:08] <%aWanderingKaivo> so what's the average time to lightsaber for this game again
[2:09:10] <+OG_M_Bison> Neutral Shep isn't ideal either because you will lose party members without the speech checks
[2:09:14] <+OG_M_Bison> In ME2 anyway
[2:09:28] <%aWanderingKaivo> hey there we go lol
[2:09:29] <Gruhunchously> @OG_M_Bison Paragon Shep, after listening to Mordin's detailed breakdown about the anguishing decision he had to make in order to curb the possibility of Krogan dominance- "But how could you though"
[2:09:32] <%Undenizen> we're pretty close, i think
[2:09:35] <%FacetiousAF> DRINK
[2:09:37] <%dekkitout> Echoes- drink
[2:09:37] <%AzureGale> Lightsaber any%
[2:09:49] <%FacetiousAF> drink every time they say Echo or Echoes
[2:09:50] <%Romuken> Remember WoW's artifacts? LETS GO
[2:09:54] <%maenos2> What color you going for pat
[2:09:55] <%TheCallousKing> Pat sounds like Bart in that Simpsons episode everytime he says "Zap!"
[2:10:07] <%aWanderingKaivo> just got here at the right time it seems
[2:10:09] <+OG_M_Bison> @OG_M_Bison It's similar to ethics of the nuclear bomb
[2:10:33] <Gorgs7> the crystals sense your butt aura
[2:10:34] <%Maids4lyfe> kyber crystals neat
[2:10:39] <%Undenizen> magic hippy bullshit crystals
[2:10:49] <subjectg> JO crystals
[2:10:55] <subjectg> Jedi Order crystals
[2:11:14] <%Romuken> bug time
[2:11:14] <%MrH00dz> The Crystals would grow back Even bigger, just to spite you
[2:11:18] <Gorgs7> lol, just while this convo was happening
[2:11:20] <%Maids4lyfe> who do these horrific bug monsters only have one arm?
[2:11:21] <Gruhunchously> ZAAAP
[2:11:25] <Broken_Sonex> The force the force the force, crystals crystals crystals.
[2:11:25] <%aWanderingKaivo> get the bugzapper
[2:11:45] <+OG_M_Bison> @Maids4lyfe Genetics idk
[2:11:46] <Gruhunchously> The crystals would grow back with 'Live, Laugh, Love' engraved on them.
[2:11:59] <+OG_M_Bison> @Gruhunchously Underrated comment
[2:12:15] <KeiPrime> duality of man, ZAP KILL, oh hey doggy
[2:12:30] <Psyramics> no
[2:12:33] <faithless_zealot> No, your cam is blocking it, duh
[2:12:34] <%aWanderingKaivo> crystals would grow back in the shape of a hand giving the finger

[2:14:14] <Broken_Sonex> Yeah, it won't move at all by the endgame @PatStaresAt
[2:14:25] <%AzureGale> WHAT AN EPIC BATTLE
[2:14:31] <Gruhunchously> YEAH KILL DA BABIES
[2:14:50] <subjectg> You get so many force points that you’d have to work very hard to empty that bar
[2:14:52] <purplestufff> THE BABY
[2:14:53] <%MrH00dz> NOT THE YOUNGLINGS... not again...
[2:14:55] <KeiPrime> not just the men but the women and the children
[2:14:55] <%Undenizen> isn't killing the babies a good thing? aren't these animals bad?
[2:15:04] <ShichiNoBushi> Make the force crystals bleed and turn them red.
[2:15:10] <%X2Eliah> Let's be real, if it's an alien in a huge egg in a cave, probably best to actually kill it
[2:15:20] <OldManDeckardCain> it's okay they are stil in the first trimester Kappa
[2:15:22] <GustauveVIII> is pat dual wielding or double blading?
[2:15:25] <%Alazull> I am becoming death incarnate?

[2:16:08] <%MrH00dz> The Crystal wants to see the manager of the lightsaber
[2:16:10] <%Alazull> @PatStaresAt Have you made up your mind what prestige class you're going with?
[2:16:23] <Broken_Sonex> It's almost as if you're like....milking the force around you or something, i dunno..... Kappa
[2:16:29] <%AzureGale> Get big force for big and hard crystal
[2:16:30] <Gorgs7> It adapts to the size of your force dick
[2:16:37] <Gruhunchously> I would have though Kae'ryn would love to have the crystal, so she could use it for her herbal remedies.
[2:16:46] <%TIME_PUNCHER> Kriss'Tal is Kae'Ryn's stripper name.
[2:17:02] <%MrH00dz> LUL
[2:17:03] <+OG_M_Bison> NO YOU STILL NEED A FOCUSING LENS

[2:17:42] <faithless_zealot> You should kill more Kinrath, surely they would have one =)

[2:18:38] <packers81> You can become really op in this very fast
[2:18:41] <dinnydanny777> Karens do not sneak

[2:19:09] <%dekkitout> He's a combat nerd?
[2:19:13] <dinnydanny777> Other people sneak when they hear a nearby Karem
[2:19:15] <%Maids4lyfe> cut his tentacles off
[2:19:16] <ShichiNoBushi> Kae'Ryn: "No they aren't. I killed all the kinrath."
[2:19:21] <%Maids4lyfe> how dare he not be human
[2:19:24] <%Maids4lyfe> xenoscum
[2:19:32] <%AzureGale> Cava doom pah

[2:19:46] <%Alazull> I'm sorry, I said I WANT A GLAND, NOW
[2:19:51] <+OG_M_Bison> Don't kill him Pat
[2:19:58] <%aWanderingKaivo> steal his gland for no reason
[2:20:01] <+OG_M_Bison> This is so fucking funny LUL

[2:20:13] <%dekkitout> HahaPoint
[2:20:15] <+rdark_ksu> lol get merked
[2:20:16] <%UvBenServed> Owned
[2:20:18] <rjhascancer> that was comedy
[2:20:20] <Cyphereous> "What a rotten way to die."
[2:20:23] <+OG_M_Bison> Cause he gets killed by the Kinrath LUL
[2:20:23] <%Futurecity10> idk, he's a nothing npc
[2:20:24] <BlueLunecy> But Pat DIDN'T kill him
[2:20:24] <%FacetiousAF> why would you not murder super hard
[2:20:26] <Gorgs7> because they'll kill him for you
[2:20:27] <subjectg> nah, it’s fine
[2:20:37] <KaitlynnHere> ......
[2:20:41] <Gruhunchously> Kreia approves
[2:20:43] <+OG_M_Bison> It's just a funny scene
[2:20:44] <GustauveVIII> thats a guy no one cares about
[2:20:47] <%Huntercd> Take his stuff
[2:20:49] <%juxtest> He was destined to save the galaxy
[2:20:52] <EuropanLamprey> Jigsaw technically never killed anyone
[2:20:55] <%MrH00dz> Kria could not approve harder
[2:21:00] <Gruhunchously> God, she is so Karen
[2:21:03] <%Romuken> now you'll never get the boudikai tenkaichi superstar nova lens
[2:21:08] <+OG_M_Bison> @EuropanLamprey TRUE
[2:21:09] <dinnydanny777> The Sith pose is very Karen ngl
[2:21:12] <%MrH00dz> Jigsaw did nothing worng
[2:21:17] <+OG_M_Bison> Jigsaw was objectively correct Kappa
[2:21:18] <ChungusQuest> fuck yeah, choke that bug
[2:21:42] <%TIME_PUNCHER> they're like Pokemon you can kill
[2:21:44] <+OG_M_Bison> I'm gonna make you cutoff your arm cause you're a smoker LUL
[2:21:57] <Gruhunchously> The idea of superpowered Karen is legit terrifying. Especially if she constantly insists that she's the one being wronged while she's choking an d zapping everyone.
[2:21:57] <Broken_Sonex> Really, Jigsaw was a hero Kappa
[2:22:01] <+OG_M_Bison> I'm gonna make you cut out pieces of your stomach cause you eat junk food LUL
[2:22:06] <%FacetiousAF> we did it, we fed the kinrath
[2:22:09] <%Romuken> You ever play in a star wars rpg as a jedi but thought to yourself "you know, I'ma use force push on that guy's neck before he can call for help?"
[2:22:11] <%AzureGale> Bug horibles
[2:22:12] <%FacetiousAF> what do you mean we shouldn't have fed them?
[2:22:27] <+OG_M_Bison> @Romuken It's the jedi way Kappa
[2:22:33] <Gruhunchously> You are like on the first half of your first planet
[2:22:34] <%rekinom> Do I need to play the first game to play the second one?
[2:22:42] <%AzureGale> The story parts are like Chaos Emeralds
[2:22:46] <%aWanderingKaivo> force persuade everyone that she is being wronged and then zapping them anyway
[2:22:47] <Gorgs7> yeah, and after you get the lightsaber, areas just get bigger if I remember right
[2:22:51] <%cylish> Depends on if you do the robot planet
[2:22:55] <%Futurecity10> Hey Pat, any thoughts on Warrior? I'm a Dark knight main and really enjoying warrior
[2:23:00] <Paciboyy> Thats because peragus through telos and shit takes too long and feels *dense* after that its quick and fun
[2:23:06] <subjectg> @rekinom you don’t have to, but it’s recommended you do
[2:23:06] <Gruhunchously> Good
[2:23:06] <Bludee> Bug stopped my progression on OG xbox.... story is weak
[2:23:12] <+OG_M_Bison> The robot planet was pretty bad if I remember correctly
[2:23:16] <Broken_Sonex> Good, it's robot planet is fucking dreck
[2:23:16] <%MassConnect> but one planet is super short?
[2:23:17] <dinnydanny777> And you're already almost full Sith
[2:23:18] <Gruhunchously> The robot planet just isn't worth the slog
[2:23:28] <%Romuken> @OG_M_Bison No, the jedi way is then getting a crit while trying to do that to a massive transport ship. Because one of the passengers swindled another PC out of jetpack. We got it back.
[2:23:35] <+OG_M_Bison> @Gruhunchously It drags so long
[2:23:45] <%AzureGale> Kinraths On A Plane
[2:23:50] <%Romuken> I miss that campaign, man.
[2:23:51] <+OG_M_Bison> @Romuken LUL
[2:23:51] <Bludee> Darth Karen
[2:23:51] <%aWanderingKaivo> is the robot planet restored content or something?
[2:24:03] <%Huntercd> Hopefully with more murder
[2:24:08] <CursedNobleman> its mer-canneries, not merc en aeries
[2:24:16] <Gruhunchously> You love Gerevick because he's basically you.
[2:24:18] <Broken_Sonex> He's a Blood Dimond villain
[2:24:27] <%aWanderingKaivo> Wow, nice
[2:24:29] <+OG_M_Bison> Is the robot planet the HK factory?
[2:24:34] <+OG_M_Bison> Or is that different?
[2:24:35] <%dekkitout> *Restored* is a kind operative
[2:24:50] <%MrH00dz> He knows the game code, and cannot be killed. Why else would be so confident in his assholeness ?
[2:24:55] <Gruhunchously> The biggest problem with TSLRCM is that is sometimes doesn't distinguish between what was cut for time and what was meant to be cut.
[2:24:56] <Broken_Sonex> He's seeing through Karen's bullshit.
[2:24:56] <CursedNobleman> unlocked is more accurate
[2:24:57] <dinnydanny777> The idea of Atton being light side at all is kind of weird
[2:24:57] <+Mindtrick_Matt> HE got away from you for once and it cleared his head lol
[2:25:07] <%Alazull> Weren
[2:25:19] <%Alazull> Weren't you going to take a big peepees?
[2:25:22] <CursedNobleman> it sucked. LUL
[2:25:27] <redrins> some stuff got removed for a reason
[2:25:29] <Gruhunchously> You know how there are some people where you just can't think straight around them? You are that person to Atton.
[2:25:32] <%PinionGear> the robot planet was awful
[2:25:32] <+OG_M_Bison> @dinnydanny777 Killing jedi is morally good Kappa
[2:25:39] <Estwilde> Almost like it never made it to the full game for a reason
[2:25:50] <@commanderclaw> Force storm even carries lightsiders
[2:25:54] <$Sperbus> Eyepatch is ranking top 100 Games of all time and put Symphony of the Night in the shadow realm below it, wtf
[2:25:58] <Cyphereous> The big die.
[2:25:58] <Aydarkzero> deth spell
[2:26:11] <%AzureGale> ok
[2:26:13] <Bludee> You don't get 'unlimited power'
[2:26:13] <%MassConnect> Again?
[2:26:14] <rjhascancer> smart idea
[2:26:14] <%FacetiousAF> DRINK WATER
[2:26:17] <%dekkitout> At the same time?
[2:26:17] <Gruhunchously> In Woolie's LP he got to the point where he was wiping out entire rooms with one attack.
[2:26:21] <+OG_M_Bison> I need to take a piss too
[2:26:23] <%the22cstomp> cheaty piss?
[2:26:24] <+OG_M_Bison> Thanks for pee break :)
[2:26:30] <%Huntercd> Oh I thought he meant Darth Karen
[2:26:36] <%Huntercd> I am disappointed
[2:26:39] <%MassConnect> x to doubt piss
[2:26:43] <rjhascancer> anyone know what difficulty pat is playing on?
[2:26:47] <+OG_M_Bison> @Gruhunchously With Force lightning? As a jedi?
[2:26:50] <%MassConnect> what nefarious break is he really taking
[2:26:53] <Broken_Sonex> @Gruhunchously Can't think with all the Goth PAWG on the ship
[2:27:17] <+OG_M_Bison> @Gruhunchously What Goth PAWG???
[2:27:18] <+OG_M_Bison> Where?
[2:27:45] <Gruhunchously> @Gruhunchously Yes
[2:27:51] <Broken_Sonex> @Gruhunchously Have you seen the female models in this game?
[2:28:06] <+OG_M_Bison> NOPE
[2:28:14] <dinnydanny777> Can Jedi characters be as strong as Sith?
[2:28:34] <+OG_M_Bison> Wait I lied. I forgot the handmaiden ALWAYS TAKES OFF HER CLOTHES
[2:28:54] <subjectg> yeah, jedi can stack a shitton of buffs
[2:29:00] <%MrH00dz> Kreygasm
[2:29:14] <Broken_Sonex> @OG_M_Bison Mira's also got a lot of cake. It's wild.

[2:29:30] <Broken_Sonex> Shame Hanhar is just cooler
[2:29:32] <%MrH00dz> Nobody knows
[2:29:39] <faithless_zealot> @PatStaresAt Apparently, you can Buy a focusing lens from Dantooine's old lady salvager. Save before talking to her and reload if lens is not in her inventory.

[2:31:26] <$StrawberryPantsu> "WHERE IS MY FOOD FEEBLE MAN!?"
[2:31:34] <subjectg> You sure you guys aren’t thinking of an upgrade lens?
[2:31:40] <faithless_zealot> @Romuken <3
[2:31:46] <subjectg> rather than the actual quest item lens?
[2:32:12] <Gruhunchously> oof
[2:32:24] <dinnydanny777> That actually does sound like a Karen
[2:32:25] <Broken_Sonex> Man, this woman is a fucking scrap queen. Ugh....
[2:32:38] <%MrH00dz> Man I love NPC's that talk like this. I Just CANNOT wait to help them out and totally never wanna throw them out an airlock Kappa
[2:32:45] <%Maids4lyfe> LUL
[2:32:55] <Bludee> Mando Karen vs. Darth Karen

[2:33:52] <Arbal3st> What the flame!?
[2:33:54] <@commanderclaw> Second best
[2:34:08] <@commanderclaw> For a caster it's Jal Shey Mentor
[2:34:09] <%MassConnect> the diss robe
[2:34:13] <GustauveVIII> @PATSTARESAT best robe is a robe that gives +5 wisdom to light side
[2:34:20] <%rekinom> How are you finding the best gear if you're only just starting?
[2:34:20] <Broken_Sonex> I think those are the third and second best
[2:34:23] <subjectg> Ossus Keeper Robe is pretty damn good and you get it for free later
[2:34:46] <Gruhunchously> You need a special plot lens first
[2:34:52] <+OG_M_Bison> + wisdom robes are SO GOOD Kreygasm
[2:34:55] <Broken_Sonex> It's bullshit that you can't just get any lens
[2:34:57] <%Romuken> you seriously need a quest lens to make a saber?
[2:35:07] <%MrH00dz> Buy it real good
[2:35:09] <+Terrachova> Jal Shey Mentor is the one better, but those are good
[2:35:16] <+D00msDayDan> buy one of every item to prove a point
[2:35:21] <$thomassolorio> scrap some of your guns for parts in the craft binch
[2:35:21] <KaitlynnHere> Buy them hard
[2:35:35] <@commanderclaw> Armor proficiency
[2:35:36] <Gruhunchously> @Broken_Sonex Ah but you see, these are lens UPGRADES.
[2:35:39] <subjectg> @patstaresat she ain’t got armor proficiency
[2:35:53] <%Romuken> I know you get a lens on Nar Shadaa
[2:35:59] <Gruhunchously> Samurai Karen
[2:36:19] <%RetroCop87> she looks like an earthbender
[2:36:20] <KaitlynnHere> Best armor in the game
[2:36:31] <%cylish> WHY ARE YOU GOOD AGAIN? DID YOU MOSTERIZE?
[2:36:34] <RaidenRising> oh look is the woolie armor
[2:36:37] <KaitlynnHere> @retrocop87 you mean a metal bender?
[2:36:39] <%MrH00dz> Wait why is your skin not pale
[2:36:47] <Broken_Sonex> On the male model, that armour makes the your arm slightly detached from your body
[2:36:49] <i_am_therydon> pat why are you good?
[2:36:51] <%MrH00dz> OMG DID YOU GAIN MORE LIGHT SIDE AGAIN
[2:36:51] <Gruhunchously> Hey, what happened to your face?
[2:36:52] <+OG_M_Bison> She got a tan PogChamp
[2:36:53] <+NotSoAccurateNo1> this guy looks like john stamos
[2:36:55] <%snow_bush> Its 5 campfires in a field Its shit.
[2:36:55] <@commanderclaw> You were nice I guess?
[2:36:57] <Paciboyy> she got a tan
[2:37:00] <%UvBenServed> LIGHT SIDE LATER
[2:37:02] <dinnydanny777> Oh no, Heroic Karen
[2:37:09] <%Romuken> @PatStaresAt the fixture can be found on the sublevel of the enclave. Or on Nar Shadaa near the docks apparently, via a merchant?
[2:37:12] <+OG_M_Bison> Dantoine suns are very hot
[2:37:16] <$thomassolorio> fake
[2:37:17] <KaitlynnHere> You were too nice to that guy you’d murdered earlier
[2:37:24] <%ChrisPlaysThing> You're being too nice in conversations maybe?
[2:37:24] <Gruhunchously> Don't worry, there's plenty of evil still left to do in the game.
[2:37:24] <%MrH00dz> Light side later is happening without your consent pat
[2:37:25] <%dekkitout> Nothing good comes out of a holocron- just force sensitive children and evil space ghosts
[2:37:26] <CursedNobleman> Long ago in a distant land, I, Sion, the shape-shifting Master of Darkness, unleashed an unspeakable evil! But a foolish sith karen wielding a glowing sword stepped forth to oppose me.
[2:37:38] <dinnydanny777> Is Atton's skin still falling off
[2:37:40] <$thomassolorio> scam
[2:37:47] <Broken_Sonex> Nooo, i don't want tan PAWG i want Goth PAWG.
[2:37:54] <Gruhunchously> Gotta get back, back to the store.
[2:38:17] <KaitlynnHere> Murder him and take it
[2:38:32] <%dekkitout> But for real, what's up with recent Star Wars stories always having the location of force sensitive children in holocrons
[2:38:37] <KaitlynnHere> No they won’t
[2:38:40] <i_am_therydon> kill him anyway
[2:38:41] <%MrH00dz> lol
[2:38:43] <+OG_M_Bison> She got even paler now PogChamp
[2:38:46] <$thomassolorio> hahaha
[2:38:50] <Broken_Sonex> Aaaand back to Goth PAWG. Good.
[2:38:53] <KaitlynnHere> Yea murder that fuck
[2:39:13] <%dekkitout> @Broken_Sonex Well hold on, there is place for gyaru pawg- I think...
[2:39:25] <KaitlynnHere> Awwweee....

[2:44:58] <Cyphereous> Zangief had his lower ribs removed so he could bend down far enough.
[2:45:02] <+OG_M_Bison> @commanderclaw I've heard people who can suck their dick say it's more like sucking dick than getting your dick sucked tho
[2:45:03] <UncleOliver> gief pulling a DSP

[2:45:19] <Broken_Sonex> I hate this guy's goatee

[2:45:31] <%Dakuu75> HAHAHAHA
[2:45:34] <%MrH00dz> omg the game is totally using "flame" as a replacer for "fuck"
[2:45:40] <%Huntercd> Kill all these people
[2:45:49] <KaitlynnHere> So.... do dogs normally suck themselves off?
[2:45:56] <%aWanderingKaivo> what if she's just REALLY flamboyant
[2:46:01] <%GarbageNirvana> Spoken like a true Karen
[2:46:07] <Gruhunchously> First name basis, huh?
[2:46:08] <dinnydanny777> I think Karen would support this idea ngl
[2:46:31] <Gruhunchously> @PatStaresAt Use Visas first person mode to scan the alignment of the mfs.
[2:46:34] <Broken_Sonex> @KaitlynnHere No, but they DO try to bite their own balls
[2:46:48] <%Huntercd> Break his jaw
[2:46:54] <Estwilde> We should kill this guy
[2:46:57] <%kewlmyc> I do like chocolate
[2:46:57] <+rdark_ksu> i'm going to enjoy killing you
[2:47:03] <Paciboyy> theres a quest with mandalore in here i think
[2:47:09] <Estwilde> Meat's back on the menu, boys
[2:47:13] <KaitlynnHere> Mud licker? Wow what an insult

[2:47:49] <%SaiyanShoto> I ended up killing this guy LUL LUL
[2:47:53] <%kewlmyc> Ow, my head...
[2:47:55] <subjectg> @patstaresat i think you can force this guy to drop his weapon and fight you
[2:48:05] <%MrH00dz> What a nerf herder
[2:48:07] <+OG_M_Bison> @KaitlynnHere It means you eat ass. Which isn't a bad thing
[2:48:11] <Broken_Sonex> I like how he almost broke out of the mind trick
[2:48:14] <SaltyAzteca> "these arent the questions youre looking for"
[2:48:20] <%kewlmyc> take your pills
[2:48:31] <Aydarkzero> sent to the shadow realm monkaS
[2:48:31] <+highlordspectra> just poof
[2:48:39] <%RetroCop87> MY PILLS...
[2:48:45] <KaitlynnHere> Oh does little baby gotta nurse his headache?
[2:48:47] <dinnydanny777> Grey Mandalorians?
[2:48:48] <%aWanderingKaivo> you force persuaded him out of existence
[2:48:49] <+OG_M_Bison> LUL
[2:48:52] <Estwilde> yeah you're real evil
[2:48:52] <Gruhunchously> LUL
[2:48:54] <%BallerSwagBro9k> LUL LUL
[2:48:54] <%Huntercd> Red sexual energy
[2:48:54] <+highlordspectra> the mercenaries are evil who would've thought it
[2:48:55] <%Dakuu75> predator vision?
[2:48:55] <%Romuken> look through HK's eyes
[2:48:56] <%NopeBadguy> poof
[2:48:57] <Aydarkzero> this big red spot is you
[2:49:03] <@commanderclaw> @PatStaresAt Look at Vrook with Force Sight when you find him
[2:49:04] <Aydarkzero> all evil
[2:49:09] <%dekkitout> And Kae-Ryn's a god damn red dwarf star
[2:49:11] <%ChrisPlaysThing> D. Grey Mando?
[2:49:11] <Broken_Sonex> Mado's kill for glory. Not for blood
[2:49:14] <KaitlynnHere> How are the mandos neutral
[2:49:16] <+Raiden_Breaker> "man what is this evil energy! oh its me, Nice!"
[2:49:25] <%Romuken> yey time to murder a bitch
[2:49:26] <%MassConnect> how can you be evil if you don't ask and they don't tell
[2:49:36] <%Dakuu75> I think that's semantics
[2:49:36] <thelonechris> Morally grey aka attractive
[2:49:37] <%kewlmyc> They're your average mercs. Do whatever for money
[2:49:39] <+OG_M_Bison> Also there's plot that's revealed about the Mandos later
[2:49:43] <@commanderclaw> IDK, "War is great, why are you angry" is pretty much a real life evil ideology
[2:49:43] <%dekkitout> Mandos are true neutral
[2:49:52] <Gruhunchously> Flaming
[2:49:55] <+BigDumBeak> f-flaming?
[2:50:05] <+OG_M_Bison> @commanderclaw They don't have morals. They're not evil
[2:50:07] <%MrH00dz> Jesus WHAT is with ALL the swearing
[2:50:10] <%emperordread> Ah SERVE the Flaming Thief
[2:50:11] <Gruhunchously> Language, miss
[2:50:13] <thesugardaddy111> yeah Mandos just kinda don't give a shit
[2:50:14] <%kewlmyc> War puts food on their tables for them. Shitty, yeah, but I get where they'recoming from.
[2:50:23] <%MrH00dz> Like, what the flame is this
[2:50:40] <@commanderclaw> @OG_M_Bison I guess by that metric sociopaths are neutral. Not arguing with your logic or the game's, just feels weird to me
[2:50:40] <subjectg> it’s also that they didn’t have time to give alignments to everyone so not everyone’s alignment is representative
[2:50:42] <+OG_M_Bison> Again there's also things revealed about the Mandolorians later in this game
[2:50:53] <dinnydanny777> So the force understands morality
[2:50:53] <%Dakuu75> wait... so this area is just full of ppl camping outside?
[2:50:56] <Bludee> KOTOR.... Karens of the Old Republic
[2:51:06] <subjectg> these mandos would be red if it were
[2:51:11] <%kewlmyc> Mandos sure are poilite
[2:51:16] <%aWanderingKaivo> "Marshall has no moral compass. He is a rat"
[2:51:19] <+OG_M_Bison> @commanderclaw It's similar to Greece. Their race and culture just hasn't developed morals. Also again things are revealed later
[2:51:25] <+HefestoForges> eat their bodies?
[2:51:28] <Gruhunchously> Insults you constantly "Hey can you help me out?"
[2:51:32] <+reallybigrocks> So is KOTOR canon or legends? I'm assuming the latter?
[2:51:33] <%MrH00dz> To be fair, Mandos fight everything... good or evil, so it's easy to stick to neutral
[2:51:37] <SaltyAzteca> "Nah.....that's bait"
[2:51:40] <@commanderclaw> I legit hate the D&D inspired take on Star Wars' morality in this system. Only force sensitives should have alignments
[2:51:41] <Broken_Sonex> This bitch is a Scrappy Karen @PatStaresAt
[2:51:44] <+OG_M_Bison> @reallybigrocks Legends
[2:51:46] <%AzureGale> Cue Ackbar
[2:51:50] <KaitlynnHere> It’s a total trap
[2:51:51] <Gruhunchously> LUL
[2:51:51] <%Dakuu75> she acting sus
[2:52:02] <Gruhunchously> You already alienated him beyond repair.
[2:52:05] <KaitlynnHere> She doesn’t give a fuck about doing the right thing
[2:52:29] <KaitlynnHere> Oh kewl, maybe we can find some dead Jedi here
[2:52:58] <+OG_M_Bison> I killed those people on my playthrough LUL
[2:52:59] <Broken_Sonex> WOW she's got an ass
[2:53:06] <Gruhunchously> I like that. "I'm not going to hepl the competition"
[2:53:11] <+OG_M_Bison> I don't remember
[2:53:28] <+OG_M_Bison> I think you offend them and it escalates
[2:53:29] <subjectg> bottom option looked like the murder option
[2:53:30] <%Romuken> grenade?
[2:53:34] <GustauveVIII> was it the "get out of my way" option?
[2:53:34] <%Dakuu75> probably just have to find them again
[2:53:41] <Gruhunchously> Yeah I think it's possible to murder them but i don't remember how either.
[2:53:48] <+OG_M_Bison> @GustauveVIII Yea I think so
[2:53:53] <+CanonFang_> Is this the steam version of the game?
[2:53:57] <Gruhunchously> I N S A N I T Y
[2:53:57] <%MrH00dz> @commanderclaw not to get super nerdy, but that's just how the force is in Star wars. All living things are connected to it, It's like a living that that takes everything done by everyone personally.
[2:54:07] <%aWanderingKaivo> synchronized zapping
[2:54:13] <+OG_M_Bison> @CanonFang_ Steam version with the cut content dlc thing
[2:54:15] <%MassConnect> iirc they just try to prey on you on your way out
[2:54:25] <+OG_M_Bison> I meant mod not dlc
[2:54:28] <Gruhunchously> "Prejudice set to maximum"
[2:55:01] <Gruhunchously> This is the door you can glitch into. It totally breaks the game though so don't try it.
[2:55:23] <subjectg> @mrh00dz pretty much, if someone were not detectable by force sight, they would be dead to the force, or it’s deliberate masking
[2:55:39] <@commanderclaw> @MrH00dz Oh I agree with the interpretation that everyone and everything is connected to the force, I just disagree that people who aren't drawing on the dark side should "ping" as evil.
[2:55:55] <dinnydanny777> Hacker Karen
[2:55:56] <Broken_Sonex> @MrH00dz No wonder Kreia hates it.
[2:55:59] <%aWanderingKaivo> shouldn't it be "slice into the mainframe"
[2:56:13] <%AzureGale> Is gief snoring
[2:56:19] <Gruhunchously> Is he still sucking his own dick?
[2:56:24] <%dekkitout> Pretty sure Jabba the Hut would register as fat evil of a force-o'-meter
[2:56:42] <dinnydanny777> Isn't Jabba force resistant
[2:56:51] <Gruhunchously> Yeah well, not everyone is the god of death like you.
[2:57:02] <%Dakuu75> so these are jedi ruins?
[2:57:25] <%Dunmarkh> ye
[2:57:37] <CursedNobleman> optimal accuracy ratio achieved
[2:57:41] <%dekkitout> The proverbial force-o-meter being force sight for clarity
[2:57:47] <Broken_Sonex> Ohh, GOD i forgot about the girl you find here....
[2:58:05] <dinnydanny777> Isn't being able to see the force kind of strong
[2:58:18] <%Dakuu75> maybe these are just the babies and and the mean ones are further in?
[2:58:26] <Gruhunchously> The Restored Content girl? Yeah, that's gonna be fun.
[2:58:29] <+CanonFang_> why can't the force let me raise some skeletons?
[2:58:32] <+OG_M_Bison> @dinnydanny777 Like what Visas does? Yes
[2:58:37] <Cyphereous> Skeletons charred black. Uncle Owen, Aunt Beru, is that you?
[2:58:49] <%dekkitout> @CanonFang_ It can, Clone Wars has necromancy
[2:58:50] <%aWanderingKaivo> as opposed to a Rodian Hurt Blade
[2:58:53] <Estwilde> I think they were trying to scare to to keep you away from their jedi goodies
[2:58:55] <%Ghufufin> that kinda of thing can be achieved regardless of level but it requires your enemies to be more than just bundles of stats
[2:58:55] <+OG_M_Bison> @CanonFang_ It technically would. You would be puppeteering them tho
[2:59:00] <Estwilde> So embellishment makes sense
[2:59:00] <HealingMind> It's like in the CD-I Zeldas hype up Ganon as being this supreme master, and you one shot him in both games.
[2:59:12] <Broken_Sonex> @Gruhunchously I aM a PadWhaHN
[2:59:43] <Gruhunchously> Yep just stuff that body into your inventory
[2:59:50] <%captainpodock> he ded
[2:59:52] <CursedNobleman> DA DAAAAAAA DUN
[2:59:52] <GustauveVIII> there are three corpses you need to get
[2:59:53] <+OG_M_Bison> You should eat the salvagers like in New Vegas LUL
[2:59:54] <%aWanderingKaivo> music has no chill
[2:59:56] <+OG_M_Bison> Or is that in 3?
[3:00:02] <subjectg> kinda like putting your newborn child in your inventory
[3:00:03] <Estwilde> It's nice that the lights are still on in here
[3:00:12] <KaitlynnHere> @gruhunchously you just gotta fold it up
[3:00:22] <Broken_Sonex> Just I have Not Mouth and I must Scream
[3:00:29] <+OG_M_Bison> I think FONV and FO3 both had cannibalism but I'm not sure

[3:01:04] <%MrH00dz> @Estwilde The jedi paid the electricity bill ahead of time for like a couple hundred years.
[3:01:12] <BinaryShuffle> conduits are temporary power, you have UNLIMITED power
[3:01:22] <%aWanderingKaivo> mine resistant bugs
[3:01:41] <%Dakuu75> @PatStaresAt would those mines one-shot you if they hit you?
[3:01:54] <Gruhunchously> Plot Twist: The bugs are teh ones that set the mines
[3:02:26] <%MrH00dz> Those flamers are getting smart
[3:02:29] <subjectg> first they learned to open doors, then they learned how to arm explosives
[3:02:59] <subjectg> then they started forming terrorist cells and demanding sovereign territory
[3:03:05] <GustauveVIII> @patstaresat the overload terminals have a "set timer" so they dont explode immediately when you arm them
[3:03:25] <%MrH00dz> Soon they will steal ALL the jobs
[3:03:36] <+OG_M_Bison> I would've done 1 second
[3:03:41] <+OG_M_Bison> 10 is a waste of your time Kappa
[3:04:09] <+aWanderingKaivo> I want to know who designs their PC with a timed self destruct feature
[3:04:17] <Gruhunchously> Guy starved to death. Nasty way to go
[3:04:22] <%SpcOpsBear> They don't
[3:04:24] <%SpcOpsBear> It's a hack
[3:04:27] <+OG_M_Bison> Everyone in the KOTOR universe
[3:04:39] <%MrH00dz> lol this ^
[3:04:41] <faithless_zealot> It's not the worst way to go out
[3:04:45] <Estwilde> don't worry, im sure he died of thirst before that
[3:04:45] <%ChrisPlaysThing> It's alright if you only do it half-way Kappa
[3:04:46] <%SpcOpsBear> Literally use a computer spike to slice the terminal so you can program it to self-destruct
[3:05:30] <Gruhunchously> "Condescending Encouragement: Yes, Master. You CUT that door Master.
[3:05:33] <%bigfastkaratedealership> can you imagine just slapping a metal door with a katana till it opened? real life would be so easy for weebs
[3:05:34] <dinnydanny777> Is T3 a Darth yet?
[3:05:39] <%aWanderingKaivo> Oh I missed the slice part
[3:06:04] <+OG_M_Bison> Chat what's your opinion on white chocolate?
[3:06:18] <Estwilde> i don't care for it
[3:06:26] <%Dakuu75> the music in here loves the fucking trumpet
[3:06:27] <%MrH00dz> An astromech holding a shoto lightsaber with his tiny robot hand... now that's a terrifying sight
[3:06:31] <BenTensCousin> man i wish kotor 1 had the console UI on PC
[3:06:33] <+OG_M_Bison> I think it's pretty good honestly
[3:06:33] <%dekkitout> Tastes like wax- love it, next

[3:06:48] <SaltyAzteca> ZZZAP
[3:06:53] <Gruhunchously> See, four of them at once could get you pretty bad.
[3:07:04] <%DakotaMacDoodle> it's a star wars its all trumpets pat
[3:07:11] <%aWanderingKaivo> I'm pretty ok with the white choc
[3:07:12] <%Dakuu75> no one this place got abandoned, no one could handle allt he trumpets
[3:07:22] <%GarbageNirvana> What orchestra do you think they went with for this game
[3:07:37] <%dekkitout> Bury the lightning deep within your foes
[3:07:39] <Gruhunchously> It's probably in the credits
[3:07:41] <+Raiden_Breaker> Lighting returns
[3:07:46] <%bigfastkaratedealership> next star wars should say fuck it and just use ska music
[3:07:48] <%GarbageNirvana> Probably
[3:07:59] <%GarbageNirvana> but I wanna hear guesses

[3:08:10] <%Undenizen> @bigfastkaratedealership Reggae star wars

[3:09:36] <%Dakuu75> the only thing we should all agree on, is that Country music is an abomination.

[3:22:18] <%dekkitout> Since when has death stopped a real G?
[3:22:19] <MrBaldachin> pretty sure anybody who knows d&d knows toughness
[3:22:23] <%maenos2> you're right pat, people die when they are killed after all
[3:22:35] <+OG_M_Bison> @maenos2 Thanks Shirou
[3:22:37] <abelincoln_catpuncher> gonna get that free lightsaber finesse?
[3:22:39] <%aWanderingKaivo> ah I see
[3:22:41] <@commanderclaw> @ChrisPlaysThing Me after a quick google search: *Oh no*
[3:22:53] <tanarath> @patstaresat Have you considered Fear/horror/insanity?
[3:23:03] <%ChrisPlaysThing> LUL
[3:23:14] <%aWanderingKaivo> I think he has Fear already
[3:23:18] <Gruhunchously> @PatStaresAt Can't you just bring Kreia out her?
[3:23:24] <Gruhunchously> *here
[3:23:36] <+OG_M_Bison> @tanarath Those are good but the problem is that why crowd control people when you can just kill thme
[3:23:38] <+OG_M_Bison> them'
[3:23:58] <tanarath> Horror & Insanity are aoe stuns… though
[3:24:02] <scrublordsamurai> boadow is great too bad he gets it the worst
[3:24:07] <%Dakuu75> wait so, who was that loopy padawan we killed a minute ago? jsut some unimportant-rando?
[3:24:14] <%dekkitout> That's a good sound I'm told
[3:24:15] <+OG_M_Bison> @tanarath And force lightning is aoe KILL
[3:24:26] <tanarath> cc for good lightning/storm formations
[3:24:46] <%SolidusRex> Isn't Sith Master the worst prestige class?
[3:24:48] <@commanderclaw> "So Fighter, Rogue, Wizard?"
[3:24:54] <Broken_Sonex> @Dakuu75 Yep. She was pretty much nothing.
[3:24:59] <+OG_M_Bison> @tanarath The aoe is so big on lightning you don't need it
[3:25:00] <%SolidusRex> Sith Lord I mean
[3:25:09] <%dekkitout> The way of the Sith Lord sounds a lot like the strength of nakama
[3:25:17] <+OG_M_Bison> At the end game your lightning goes through walls and doors and kills people on the other side
[3:25:21] <DublinRage> What did Woolie pick?
[3:25:24] <Broken_Sonex> USE T3 @PatStaresAt
[3:25:26] <%SolidusRex> T3 is a work bench
[3:25:30] <Gruhunchously> T3 is a workbench
[3:25:34] <subjectg> @patstaresat T3 is your workbench
[3:25:37] <abelincoln_catpuncher> @dublinrage Jedi Master
[3:25:37] <DexteraXIII> Isn't T3 the workbench?
[3:25:38] <$thomassolorio> t3 is binch
[3:25:59] <%Alazull> cheer520 You know I'm thinking the perfect example of how most people think of Jedi is that Imperial Officer who gets choked out by Vader in a New Hope. Straight up tells a guy he has to know is capable of at the very least some real power that he's just preaching superstition. If a dude who ostensibly should know what the Jedi at least were to pop off like that to someone like Vader shows that most people really don't know what Jedi are really capable of.
[3:26:10] <%CatastropheCorvid> Sith Lord is boss. You can just Force Kill/Lightning your way through the game.
[3:26:10] <+OG_M_Bison> @PatStaresAt You know you'll have to use different squads and go solo at some points in the game right? Like solo with different characters
[3:26:16] <%MrH00dz> T3's like "What is my purpose ?" And Kae'ryn like "You are my mobile workbench"
[3:26:49] <GustauveVIII> Kae'ryn: Decent Charisma. Is a bitch to everyone.
[3:26:57] <%Romuken> T3, pass butter
[3:27:00] <TourettesPlays> no
[3:27:03] <TourettesPlays> deflection useless
[3:27:08] <%Dakuu75> I assume someone asked. Is pat planning to stream the RE showcase?
[3:27:10] <%CatastropheCorvid> There's a crystal for deflefction
[3:27:15] <subjectg> Deflection bonus is pretty bad
[3:27:23] <+OG_M_Bison> @PatStaresAt Just so you know that force corruption ability increases your allies influence I THINK
[3:27:24] <SoftLusca> I made the mistake of focusing on deflection the first time I played.
[3:27:31] <tanarath> CRUSH
[3:27:42] <Gruhunchously> Fits the Karen theme, I agree
[3:27:48] <subjectg> and generally you want to save your crystal slots for BIG damages
[3:27:51] <Gruhunchously> The ability to induce insanity
[3:28:04] <scrublordsamurai> you can now inflict insanity as is the way of karen!
[3:28:11] <tanarath> Insanity is a spamable aoe stun
[3:28:12] <ape_hawk> insane in the membrane?
[3:28:15] <%Dakuu75> ^
[3:28:35] <TourettesPlays> BibleThump T3
[3:28:46] <scrublordsamurai> you gonna equipmonk the lightsayba
[3:28:51] <+OG_M_Bison> @ape_hawk Insane in the brain?
[3:28:53] <subjectg> @patstaresat quick note, in order to grab the best upgrades for your lightsaber/whatever, you need 27-29 points in a skill needed
[3:29:07] <+OG_M_Bison> What is my purpose? You pass the butter
[3:29:29] <subjectg> Anyone
[3:29:43] <GustauveVIII> @PATSTARESAT You can create equipment mods at a chemical station to upgrade your shit.
[3:29:46] <tanarath> @patstaresat Whoevery crafts it
[3:29:53] <TourettesPlays> Bao Dur and the Robots are the best at making upgrades
[3:29:59] <scrublordsamurai> equipmonk
[3:30:10] <%MrH00dz> ENCHANTMENT
[3:30:20] <%SolidusRex> All skills basically
[3:30:27] <subjectg> Almost every skill gives you upgrades
[3:30:30] <TourettesPlays> Computer, security, awareness
[3:30:45] <TourettesPlays> Awareness is ranged and lightsaber upgrades I think
[3:30:46] <scrublordsamurai> depends on what your making
[3:31:02] <tanarath> @patstaresat All skills can make their own upgrades, do research on it.
[3:31:02] <subjectg> You need someone with a high skill for all of them at least
[3:31:14] <%MrH00dz> Ohh that sound Kreygasm
[3:31:19] <TourettesPlays> You're finally a star war
[3:31:22] <ape_hawk> didnt you want a purple one?
[3:31:30] <Vyskus> the stun on the bondar crystal sucks, look at the dc to negate it
[3:31:36] <%aWanderingKaivo> shooom zwwom shjoom.
[3:31:37] <%MrH00dz> @ape_hawk Kappa
[3:31:47] <GustauveVIII> @PatStaresAt Equipment that gives bonuses to skills also contribute to being able to create advanced shit.
[3:31:48] <TourettesPlays> WARNING: This vendor can totally break and it can become impossible to access her shop.
[3:31:53] <scrublordsamurai> its not purple its clearly blue
[3:32:15] <%MassConnect> what? Pat lightsaber?
[3:32:18] <%Dunmarkh> should have gone twinblade
[3:32:21] <@commanderclaw> Woolie and V never used the short lightsaber cause they hated it
[3:32:23] <%MrH00dz> Ahsoka Tano wants to know your location
[3:32:24] <$thomassolorio> u should buy every crystal you find
[3:32:25] <+OG_M_Bison> Isn't there like only one short lightsaber in this game? I'm probably wrong
[3:32:31] <%Dunmarkh> fair enough
[3:32:38] <%Alazull> short lightsaber for offhand
[3:32:42] <ninjamoose425> one handed lightsabers are classy
[3:32:42] <%Agami23> but pat, aesthetic
[3:32:42] <subjectg> You can also buff yourself with Valor to make crafting easier
[3:32:43] <+fetrigon> LUL
[3:32:46] <%SolidusRex> You can use two full lightsabers
[3:32:47] <@commanderclaw> Aesthetics , they thought it looked dumb
[3:32:47] <rjhascancer> probably
[3:32:49] <%Puhff> Yes
[3:32:51] <%ChrisPlaysThing> 1-1
[3:32:51] <Gruhunchously> Yes
[3:32:52] <+OG_M_Bison> Off hand weapons = WAAAAAAY BETTER than regular one handed weapons
[3:32:52] <%Undenizen> fashion souls
[3:32:52] <abelincoln_catpuncher> they didn't like the short aesthetic
[3:32:52] <%MidnightBurst12> aesthetics tho
[3:32:53] <Broken_Sonex> @PatStaresAt Woolie and V are all about fashion
[3:32:55] <ape_hawk> no, theyre canadian
[3:32:56] <TourettesPlays> @OG_M_Bison Game starts giving them out like candy shortly enough
[3:33:00] <dinnydanny777> Lightsaber bug dagger
[3:33:00] <%CatastropheCorvid> It's not though. At higher levels, you don't need it for the hit bonus.
[3:33:00] <%Alazull> it literally makes you better at two weapon fighting
[3:33:01] <%dekkitout> Pat you saw Woolie play MHW
[3:33:01] <GustauveVIII> since your strength modifier gets so high you're almost able to hit 100% of the time
[3:33:02] <subjectg> Think of it as a katana + wakizashi, that’s sick
[3:33:03] <%Puhff> muh aesthetic
[3:33:05] <tanarath> They're crazy
[3:33:08] <%MrH00dz> But it's so much cooler when one is shorter than the other !
[3:33:14] <OldManDeckardCain> woolie apparently has to compensate for something with long lightsabers Kappa
[3:33:14] <ShichiNoBushi> Less damage for more accuracy.
[3:33:16] <Gruhunchously> Using two full ones is an accuracy penalty I think
[3:33:18] <%Agami23> its noticeably smaller though, it sets off the woolie goblins.
[3:33:19] <+OmegaWeltall> thats how i played KOTOR1
[3:33:20] <@commanderclaw> Aesthetics
[3:33:21] <%CatastropheCorvid> Damage
[3:33:22] <RetributionP> it dosnt look good that's why
[3:33:27] <+OG_M_Bison> @CatastropheCorvid Depends on what stats you're increasing
[3:33:28] <%Undenizen> they worked SO hard to never get a short saber
[3:33:30] <%NopeBadguy> you lose out on damage with short
[3:33:30] <dinnydanny777> But how would they make the lightsaber short
[3:33:30] <%SaiyanShoto> I use two full ones cause I don’t like the small ones LUL LUL
[3:33:35] <tanarath> SLIGHT damage
[3:33:39] <+D00msDayDan> i bet they made penis jokes
[3:33:43] <%ChrisPlaysThing> mercd
[3:33:43] <$thomassolorio> ha
[3:33:44] <TourettesPlays> Does Lightsaber finesse make STR a useless dump stat in this game?
[3:33:46] <%DakotaMacDoodle> But Fashion Wars
[3:33:49] <+OG_M_Bison> @dinnydanny777 It's the handle probably
[3:33:53] <Vyskus> it's only like +2 to one attack, which is fairly small in the late game
[3:33:53] <%Alazull> @patstaresat This is why I keep saying Woolie had his head fully up his own ass for this game
[3:33:56] <%Puhff> Oh god forgot about MHW Pockets trashfire
[3:33:59] <Gruhunchously> @PatStaresAt Don't let the Laigreks kill him, kill him yourself.
[3:34:00] <ninjamoose425> holy shit nice lol
[3:34:03] <subjectg> @tourettesplays you get bonus damage with STR, so no
[3:34:03] <@commanderclaw> I like how at this point the whole "difficulty" thing goes away
[3:34:04] <%CatastropheCorvid> @CatastropheCorvid IDK, I went full wizard and could still hit everything I aimed at with dual sabers.
[3:34:11] <%MrH00dz> Asymmetrical is always the way
[3:34:11] <MrBaldachin> not SUPPOSED to
[3:34:17] <+OG_M_Bison> Kill him anyway >:)
[3:34:21] <Broken_Sonex> @PatStaresAt They didn't use a short one because it didn't look cool.
[3:34:47] <ShichiNoBushi> The short light saber has less damage (1d6 instead of 1d8, I believe) but is "Balanced" which means if held in off-hand reduces the two-handed fighting penalty by 2.
[3:35:04] <tanarath> Insanity is stup8d
[3:35:08] <%BallerSwagBro9k> Pat is nutting
[3:35:18] <tanarath> most broken shit ever
[3:35:24] <malcobraaklynny> What planet is he on?
[3:35:32] <MrBaldachin> you can make the benefit of short sabers moot with the raw stats you get in this game
[3:35:34] <abelincoln_catpuncher> Dantooine
[3:35:34] <TourettesPlays> ??? sex...power?
[3:35:34] <Paciboyy> dantooine
[3:35:37] <%BinaryFireball> has pat found corpse(nothing) yet?
[3:35:38] <%ChrisPlaysThing> A SexSplosion, if you will
[3:35:40] <%CatastropheCorvid> @malcobraaklynny Dantooine
[3:35:45] <dinnydanny777> Sex powered Karen NotLikeThis
[3:35:48] <zorakhazix> @malcobraaklynny I've been thinking about that question for a very, very long time
[3:35:56] <%MrH00dz> Sex magic, best magic
[3:36:00] <Gruhunchously> Nailed it
[3:36:03] <Broken_Sonex> @Alazull Indeed. Woolie was very eww, a lot of the time.
[3:36:07] <%aWanderingKaivo> that's a good trade off, 1d6 vs 1d8 is just on average 1 less damage
[3:36:22] <TourettesPlays> Yo I fucked up this sidequest super hard and the lady vendor refused to sell to me so be careful
[3:36:25] <%dekkitout> It just works
[3:36:32] <+OG_M_Bison> Also you just open doors in one hit
[3:36:35] <ShichiNoBushi> Everything is left to this stranger named "Kae'Ryn" who the guy never met.
[3:36:35] <%MrH00dz> Star Wars has the best sound... everything
[3:36:36] <+OG_M_Bison> Cause why wouldn't you?
[3:36:40] <%BinaryFireball> sound design never gets enough credit
[3:36:48] <%BinaryFireball> sound guys are fucking wizards
[3:36:52] <%GarbageNirvana> original trilogy sound guys were on point
[3:37:00] <Gruhunchously> I'd say the sound and visual design is half the appeal of Star Wars
[3:37:07] <%BinaryFireball> and thats why they know abunch of wizard shit that makes sound in media amzaing
[3:37:10] <subjectg> @patstaresat it’s cool, but you get tiny amounts of exp by using security to unlock shit
[3:37:13] <%MassConnect> music
[3:37:13] <gildor0> yeah it's such a timeless sound and you know it right away
[3:37:16] <%aWanderingKaivo> I mean, at least half
[3:37:31] <%GarbageNirvana> never enough appreciation goes into Foley work
[3:37:35] <ItsJustThatSimp_le> real lightsabers will sound like that for sure
[3:37:49] <Gruhunchously> Ralph McQuarrie and Ben Burt (and John Williams) carried the whole franchise on their shoulders.
[3:37:58] <%BinaryFireball> I wonder what lightsabers would sound like if they were invented this year
[3:38:01] <%aWanderingKaivo> what if a real lightsaber was made and it sounded like a wet fart
[3:38:23] <%MrH00dz> I giddy with joy whenever a lightsaber lights up... never gets old
[3:38:39] <%Romuken> it kills those droids?
[3:38:44] <bigzitsmagee> make explosion
[3:38:44] <%GalacticaPhanto> it's like Poetry, it rhymes
[3:38:51] <%MassConnect> aren't there existing thigns that *don't* make noise but we added noise to them because it appeals to us?
[3:39:07] <%MrH00dz> This ^
[3:39:17] <dinnydanny777> Aren't electric cars too quiet and have to have noise added to them?
[3:39:21] <%Undenizen> this feels... unfinished
[3:39:31] <+OG_M_Bison> @MassConnect Yes
[3:39:38] <Gruhunchously> Karen buys cheap droids, immediately breaks them and demands a refund.
[3:39:42] <%Ipsenscastle> @MassConnect i mean car doors would make a crappy clang noise if not for all the noise design that goes into them
[3:39:57] <%MrH00dz> Some exotic electric cars have a thing that makes a sound when you rev the engine and such... it's pure asthetic and does nothing
[3:39:59] <+OG_M_Bison> @dinnydanny777 Yea I'm pretty sure electric engines don't make any noise
[3:40:14] <+OG_M_Bison> @MrH00dz It's for nostalgia purposes
[3:40:17] <gildor0> is this with the restored content mod? i never played it with that but have this on pc and really should get around to it
[3:40:23] <dinnydanny777> @og_m_bison Yeah, I think they were concerned pedestrians wouldn't hear them
[3:40:35] <%aWanderingKaivo> @gildor0 yup
[3:40:38] <+OG_M_Bison> @dinnydanny777 That makes a lot of sense actually
[3:40:55] <%MrH00dz> Oh yeah that does
[3:40:56] <subjectg> funnily enough i don’t think you got any bonus DC from getting to prestige
[3:41:01] <%Ipsenscastle> zthap
[3:41:16] <gildor0> nice
[3:41:22] <ninjamoose425> there was a video of a guy who set the pedestrian warning system on his tesla to bruh sound effect #2
[3:41:25] <%MrH00dz> woomp woomp, whoomp, woomp
[3:41:31] <+OG_M_Bison> Could a lightsaber be a music instrument?
[3:41:31] <tanarath> @gildor0 yes, but avoid the full restored content, look for the limited one, some restored content sucks or is unpolished.
[3:41:34] <%Dakuu75> woomp-woomp, woomp-woomp~
[3:41:45] <+OG_M_Bison> @ninjamoose425 LUL

[3:43:00] <dinnydanny777> Wow I feel bad for that man

[3:43:31] <%Undenizen> HK is weirdly wholesome sometimes.
[3:43:32] <%SolidusRex> I think he still has stuff on his corpse
[3:43:33] <%BallerSwagBro9k> ITS GROWING

[3:47:03] <TourettesPlays> Its really dumb that playing as the canon female Exile forces you to skip on the much more interesting Handmaiden
[3:47:04] <ape_hawk> yeah, this HAS to be cullen
[3:47:04] <%Dakuu75> Why is everyone always so eager to get holo-crons in teh star wars universe?

[3:48:04] <dinnydanny777> @broken_sonex Yep
[3:48:05] <+OG_M_Bison> @Broken_Sonex idk. It's turning up that a lot of VAs are shit heads tbh
[3:48:05] <%MrH00dz> @dekkitout LUL
[3:48:09] <Broken_Sonex> @MrH00dz Like, who the fuck uses this guy?
[3:48:14] <ninjamoose425> is this modded or has the game always been this good looking
[3:48:17] <%dekkitout> 💯
[3:48:20] <%vextalyst> vextalyst subscribed with Prime. They've subscribed for 12 months! Hey Pat with EA losing it's stranglehold on the IP the possibility of an obsidian kotor is real. Would you rather they follow or ignore SWOTOR? I feel treatment of certain characters in swotor range from bad to down right spiteful
[3:48:22] <%BinaryFireball> I hate his face
[3:48:24] <%aWanderingKaivo> @Broken_Sonex not afaik Cullen is just a character he played in the Dragon Age games
[3:48:27] <%Dunmarkh> modded
[3:48:30] <%MrH00dz> @ninjamoose425 modded
[3:48:33] <@commanderclaw> Eeeeh
[3:48:33] <%BinaryFireball> and his teeth
[3:48:38] <ninjamoose425> okay
[3:48:40] <Gruhunchously> @ninjamoose425 I mean it is modded, but not by much.
[3:48:42] <ape_hawk> i see a higher purpose of my foot up in their asses
[3:48:47] <Parapattern> They LITERALLY NEVER DO THAT
[3:48:49] <%dekkitout> He spittin 📠 regardless of his dumb face
[3:48:57] <%MrH00dz> Basically just an upscale to textures
[3:49:00] <taquito_blade> mod threw the lips sync off alil but fuck it
[3:49:01] <%Dakuu75> Oh yeah, I love hoe Jedi train force-children. rip them fromt heir families and tell them emotions are bad
[3:49:02] <%BinaryFireball> I wonder if kotor will ever get a remake
[3:49:11] <BerryliciousDefinition> He looks like Prince Charming from Shrek
[3:49:19] <ape_hawk> OR BOTH
[3:49:20] <jackeroff3> boyh
[3:49:20] <taquito_blade> he does
[3:49:21] <jackeroff3> both
[3:49:28] <UncleOliver> oh dog he does
[3:49:28] <%BinaryFireball> prince charming with dentures
[3:49:37] <Broken_Sonex> @BinaryFireball No. That would be a good thing.
[3:49:39] <%Dakuu75> @BerryliciousDefinition ooooooh damn it. now I can't, NOT see it
[3:49:42] <Paciboyy> they give him cool shit to talk about but this is SUCH a lame character
[3:49:42] <taquito_blade> bigger teeth
[3:49:46] <TourettesPlays> Goddamn he's as stoned as Bao Dur but isn't talking about anything intersting
[3:49:47] <%MrH00dz> Prince not so charming
[3:49:50] <Gruhunchously> What? the Jedi Code flaed? Nah.
[3:49:52] <%megaman_sentinel> questioning authority is that possible
[3:49:53] <dinnydanny777> Why are his teeth so detailed
[3:49:56] <%MrH00dz> Prince rather boring really
[3:49:58] <Parapattern> The Jedi: Humans...can be...flawed???
[3:50:01] <taquito_blade> its the hair ppl
[3:50:03] <ShichiNoBushi> Exar-kun
[3:50:16] <%BinaryFireball> @Broken_Sonex I mean yea but I can dream of companies not being total shit heads....I... I can dream
[3:50:30] <TourettesPlays> "Revan had the largest pockets in the galaxy"
[3:50:36] <Gruhunchously> "CONVINCE"
[3:50:36] <subjectg> “””convince”””
[3:50:37] <+breakersnap> teeeeeeeth
[3:50:41] <Broken_Sonex> Prince Not AT ALL Charming
[3:50:44] <ShichiNoBushi> Is Pockets the canonical Revan in this playthrough?
[3:50:44] <%Agami23> "a change of heart"
[3:50:46] <+OG_M_Bison> NO WAY Cullen's voice actor made a 40 minute video pretending to be Cullen complaining about how he got cancelled LUL
[3:50:46] <taquito_blade> so is revan canonical male or female
[3:50:47] <%MrH00dz> Revan had mad stacks
[3:50:49] <+OG_M_Bison> That's FUCKING HILARIOUS
[3:50:50] <%BinaryFireball> tell me about your teeth
[3:50:53] <ape_hawk> Revan: "yo, you wanna kill some jedi?" Everyone: "Fuck yeah!"
[3:50:55] <thetruenicster> "Change Of Heart" Also Known As Force Brainwashing
[3:51:03] <jackeroff3> So did they record separate lines if you correct atton by saying revan was a dude?
[3:51:04] <dinnydanny777> @og_m_bison Yep NotLikeThis
[3:51:05] <ItsJustThatSimp_le> tell me about your one big tooth
[3:51:15] <%MrH00dz> @OG_M_Bison Haha no way that's pure gold
[3:51:24] <+OG_M_Bison> @dinnydanny777 That is the CRINGIEST thing I've ever seen LUL
[3:51:25] <%BinaryFireball> I dont think he even has bottom teeth
[3:51:25] <%dekkitout> Canon Revan is a dude, canon Exile is a jobber
[3:51:35] <Broken_Sonex> @BinaryFireball Yes. Dreams. That and nothing more.
[3:51:36] <subjectg> @jackeroff3 separate lines for male/female and light/dark
[3:51:39] <Gruhunchously> It's true, sadly
[3:51:39] <%megaman_sentinel> the Jedi council consist of the best Jedi yet they f***** up lol
[3:51:45] <+OG_M_Bison> “Recently,” he continues, “a small vocal mob of social justice warriors attempted to have me, and my voice actor Greg Ellis tossed into the cancel culture wastelands.”
[3:51:49] <+OG_M_Bison> NO WAY THIS IS REAL LUL
[3:51:57] <dinnydanny777> @og_m_bison I think he had done videos in character before as well NotLikeThis
[3:52:08] <dinnydanny777> It's so bad NotLikeThis
[3:52:19] <taquito_blade> "why yes, have you seen shrek?"
[3:52:20] <SinnerBeta> that wasn't a shady answer at all
[3:52:22] <+OG_M_Bison> @dinnydanny777 My sides are in space right now dude LUL
[3:52:29] <%BinaryFireball> thats always the answer that screams "I know you but I dont want you to know me"
[3:52:43] <Broken_Sonex> @dekkitout God BioWear hated that Obsidian made something cool.
[3:52:53] <%Undenizen> THEY WANTED ME TO WEAR A MASK
[3:52:57] <Parapattern> PFFFFFT
[3:52:58] <london_flexing> LUL
[3:53:02] <%aWanderingKaivo> wait dude I didn't know cullen's VA was ACTUALLY a shitter lol
[3:53:14] <taquito_blade> hmmmmmm
[3:53:29] <taquito_blade> of course
[3:53:29] <%MrH00dz> AH yes ! The "GREATER" good. The golden excuse for Jedi to use when they want to be assholes but not admit it
[3:53:41] <subjectg> “No, it’s the exile who was wrong.”
[3:53:43] <%Spydurman> from my point of view the jedi are evil! BabyRage
[3:53:51] <dinnydanny777> LUL
[3:53:55] <Broken_Sonex> @MrH00dz AKA: Light Later
[3:53:59] <%ChrisPlaysThing> "We're the good guys. So we genocided the other people who we didn't agree with"
[3:54:07] <%Undenizen> y'know, historically the jedi seem laughably ineffective at solving any conflict what so ever
[3:54:07] <TourettesPlays> Disciple isn't even worth turning to the dark side
[3:54:13] <%MrH00dz> @Broken_Sonex ha
[3:54:16] <Gruhunchously> I already got best girl and best boy with me already.
[3:54:29] <%SirFancySwank> no boring deciple playthrough what a shame
[3:54:38] <%MrH00dz> A little dark now, but a big light later... I promise
[3:54:50] <Broken_Sonex> @Undenizen BECAUSE THEY DON'T DO ANYTHING
[3:54:58] <+jmcclellan18> Disciple is such a boring party member
[3:55:00] <%BallerSwagBro9k> VROOKS GONNA GET IT SO HARD LUL
[3:55:09] <Gruhunchously> Or use mods
[3:55:11] <subjectg> @undenizen they’re too busy fighting themselves man
[3:55:12] <Paciboyy> imagine getting killed by VROOK
[3:55:17] <yung_gup> disciple is annoying
[3:55:18] <Psyramics> or get the recruit both mod
[3:55:19] <ape_hawk> coulda made a male Karen
[3:55:25] <%aWanderingKaivo> aren't there mods for that?
[3:55:27] <%Futurecity10> disciple's really good
[3:55:30] <Broken_Sonex> Dude, Male Exile will always be canon in my eyes
[3:55:36] <SinnerBeta> I still can't believe how they gave handmaiden such a strong bonus ability and gave the disciple nothing
[3:55:36] <dinnydanny777> Can you make him miserable at least?
[3:55:38] <%Futurecity10> I used him a lot during onderon
[3:55:38] <%SirFancySwank> men > woman KOTOR 2
[3:55:40] <TourettesPlays> @Futurecity10 LUL
[3:55:40] <Gruhunchously> @Paciboyy Heh...yeah, imagine getting killed by Vrook...
[3:55:51] <%tinyswampthing> is the male version of karen called a steven
[3:56:00] <rjhascancer> how soon till you can dual weild lightsabers?
[3:56:00] <+OG_M_Bison> So Greg Ellis has made fun of fat people, said mental health medication is unnecessary, rants about SJWs, supported Trump, supported JK Rowling's transphobia, and much more LUL
[3:56:04] <%dekkitout> The closest I can think of the Jedi having their shit together was when they HAD to team up with Empire remnants and the Republic because of a shared enemy
[3:56:10] <Broken_Sonex> @tinyswampthing No. Scot.
[3:56:27] <dinnydanny777> I thought a male Karen was a Kyle
[3:56:29] <%tinyswampthing> damn thats
[3:56:36] <%Undenizen> eat those corpses
[3:56:49] <%MrH00dz> @OG_M_Bison oh wow, that's... problematic
[3:56:55] <BerryliciousDefinition> @tinyswampthing I think it's a Ken?
[3:57:00] <%ChrisPlaysThing> Time to make some long pig salami
[3:57:11] <Gruhunchously> Hmm...problematic
[3:57:12] <+OG_M_Bison> @MrH00dz I thought he just said the N word in 2008 or something LUL
[3:57:16] <+OG_M_Bison> It's much worse tho
[3:57:20] <subjectg> @dekkitout and even then, that’s luke’s new jedi order, which was far more effective at their jobs by actually learning from their mistakes
[3:57:25] <Broken_Sonex> @tinyswampthing It can be any douchy male name, really
[3:57:35] <%tinyswampthing> chad
[3:57:38] <%MrH00dz> Kyle
[3:57:43] <%crazyspartan214> You forgot to loot that one body
[3:57:44] <SinnerBeta> two sabers are mechanically optimal in kotor 2 but a single saber is more classy
[3:57:53] <+jmcclellan18> Pat what is your favorite piece of star wars media?
[3:57:56] <Broken_Sonex> Brad....
[3:58:22] <jackeroff3> pat how do you like the jedi knight series
[3:58:25] <%MrH00dz> Brian
[3:58:29] <ninjamoose425> How long is kotor 2? I have a hard time getting into single player games if they feel like they drag on
[3:58:38] <ninjamoose425> but this looks really cool
[3:58:43] <%MrH00dz> Oh no I know.... Richard
[3:58:44] <%Undenizen> you look GREAT
[3:58:44] <Estwilde> Damn Karen's face is lookin rough
[3:58:51] <%dekkitout> Oh gawd- ur faaace D:
[3:58:54] <%crazyspartan214> this guy didn't show up in Woolies playthorugh
[3:58:56] <%MrH00dz> It's such a good name to say in spite
[3:59:00] <taquito_blade> @patstaresat are you playing this on og xbox or is this game just more comfortable with a controller regardless?
[3:59:01] <%SirFancySwank> yes
[3:59:01] <ape_hawk> YES
[3:59:02] <%Ascethetic> yes
[3:59:02] <jackeroff3> yes
[3:59:03] <kenny_biff> YES
[3:59:03] <Parapattern> If you totaled all force users, their combined impact on the Star Wars Universe has been unequivocally disastrous for everyone else.
[3:59:04] <%aWanderingKaivo> get some moisturizer

[3:59:09] <+PenmanLupine> Nonstop Infinite Karen

[3:59:10] <BerryliciousDefinition> YES
[3:59:11] <%SGrim> Yes, it is the way
[3:59:11] <SinnerBeta> you could always turn his asshole inside out
[3:59:12] <%ChrisPlaysThing> sudden golum face
[3:59:12] <+OG_M_Bison> This dude is why I prefer male PCs in Kotor 2 (I prefer female Revan in Kotor 1)
[3:59:14] <%dekkitout> Sure, give Atton competition for your arid crotch
[3:59:16] <TourettesPlays> you should press the 1 key as fast as you can to skip all his dialogue
[3:59:17] <%captainpodock> Do it!
[3:59:22] <%MrH00dz> Turn him into not alive
[3:59:24] <%NopeBadguy> he's already an asshole
[3:59:24] <%El_GhostV1> Your choice
[3:59:25] <%crazyspartan214> turn him to the dark side
[3:59:28] <Whensmahve1> OhMyDog
[3:59:28] <%ChrisPlaysThing> Infinite Karen Works
[3:59:31] <Gruhunchously> Making simp to the dark side

[3:59:52] <%Undenizen> i say no
[3:59:52] <%SirFancySwank> we ared help ful
[3:59:53] <Estwilde> I am not a gamefaq :(
[3:59:53] <%Futurecity10> Look it up
[3:59:54] <%Dakuu75> dude, idk
[3:59:59] <BerryliciousDefinition> Corrupt him
[3:59:59] <Paciboyy> make him dick
[4:00:01] <heartlesshealer> look at that face. Sight of a saint
[4:00:01] <+OG_M_Bison> @dekkitout It's funny cause in SWOTOR lore this literally happens
[4:00:01] <%NopeBadguy> make him like you to have him match your alignment
[4:00:04] <%Puhff> Eat shit
[4:00:11] <+PaladinDupre> Yes no maybe, I dont know, can you repeat the question?
[4:00:14] <%NopeBadguy> answer him in ways he would like, even if it's light side
[4:00:22] <%Ghufufin> game really needs a 'punch face' option
[4:00:41] <%Undenizen> BETRAYAL
[4:00:43] <%SolidusRex> Is Disciple describing the real world?
[4:00:45] <nivlac_555> did anyone just hear that?
[4:00:49] <heartlesshealer> I was talking about Karen by the way. Disciple looks like a fucking storybook
[4:00:49] <%NopeBadguy> influence is more important, alignment can always be course corrected
[4:00:59] <%BallerSwagBro9k> This dude is the definition of Cardboard
[4:01:00] <%dekkitout> Was- was that almost a tone of approval from Kreia DansGame
[4:01:15] <heartlesshealer> because he sucks
[4:01:18] <Broken_Sonex> Yeah, he keeps immediately figuring out the plot and Kreia keeps making him forget
[4:01:27] <%MidnightBurst12> Disciple is great for lore but is horrible as a character
[4:01:32] <%Futurecity10> I gained all the influence I needed from talking to Disciple once
[4:01:36] <Gruhunchously> Pat, you can't expect people to like you just because you're nice to them.
[4:01:41] <%MrH00dz> I just realized that Kria could call you a pussy, any time any place without being in your party
[4:01:42] <%Futurecity10> Though that was light side
[4:01:44] <dinnydanny777> God at this point you could be fighting with Handmaiden NotLikeThis
[4:01:45] <SinnerBeta> @Broken_Sonex cool the spoilers for now
[4:01:46] <%BallerSwagBro9k> Shit doesn't usually have value Pat
[4:01:55] <%NopeBadguy> @patstaresat strategy wiki has a page for character conversations if you need it for influence
[4:02:01] <%MrH00dz> She could just whisper it in your mind
[4:02:12] <%MidnightBurst12> the crust is setting in good
[4:02:19] <ape_hawk> bone us evil
[4:02:22] <+hailinpea> @PatStaresAt Did you ever play this game before?

[4:02:27] <Gruhunchously> Crustable

[4:02:37] <ChungusQuest> pirate sneeze
[4:02:38] <Gruhunchously> He's in the medical bay
[4:02:39] <jackeroff3> Pat have you played jedi knight series
[4:02:40] <%Undenizen> can't you just like... force make him murder a puppy?
[4:02:40] <Paciboyy> bless you

[4:03:11] <GarbageQueenEllie> Oh shit! Time for Mical abuseeee
[4:03:14] <Estwilde> I think you've got to pick a mix of light & dark options with Disciple to get him to 100%
[4:03:15] <%dekkitout> @dinnydanny777 He might as well be the guy to tell the story, given his dark side end
[4:03:16] <SinnerBeta> @Broken_Sonex not the point

[4:19:35] <%BallerSwagBro9k> Kappa Kappa Kappa
[4:19:35] <scrublordsamurai> her name would be Darkness_GurlxX
[4:19:46] <GarbageQueenEllie> YEah, SWTOR, you bitch
[4:19:54] <%dekkitout> The Sith were the friends we betrayed along the way
[4:19:59] <%BallerSwagBro9k> She met no Sith Empire eh?
[4:19:59] <Broken_Sonex> @dekkitout By always looking like the good guy
[4:20:00] <%Undenizen> so is Revan canonically female?
[4:20:01] <dinnydanny777> By being cool
[4:20:02] <+OG_M_Bison> @captainpodock No Kreia actually makes good points unlike Karens
[4:20:02] <jackeroff3> I wish we saw the true sith empire
[4:20:03] <%MrH00dz> Revan was like "Watch me flip sides for a 3rd time, mofos will never see it coming"
[4:20:05] <Parapattern> Pussy was BOMB
[4:20:12] <SaltyAzteca> "INFLUENCED"
[4:20:23] <jackeroff3> a bunch of half mummy demon lords who can conjure illusions that hurt as if they were real

[4:21:26] <KaitlynnHere> They did say “leave and never come back” right?
[4:21:27] <%captainpodock> Every time he speaks I like him less.
[4:21:27] <Broken_Sonex> He's disobeying just so he can't get choked again.

[4:22:05] <KaitlynnHere> I love his disciple lips
[4:22:07] <%ScreamLord> Why would we want MORE Karth?
[4:22:09] <%Dunmarkh> Kill him
[4:22:10] <MrBaldachin> getting him instead of handmaiden is the hugest let down
[4:22:11] <%SolidusRex> I want to see you choke him again
[4:22:12] <%Alazull> I mean I've never ran with him, so it'd be cool to see a bit but I don't care that much

[4:24:08] <%AzureGale> Violence is not the answer. Violence is the question, and the answer is yes
[4:24:10] <Broken_Sonex> @dinnydanny777 I would say they're bad in different ways
[4:24:11] <%dekkitout> There's a reason the archetype is called "Carth"
[4:24:15] <%Puhff> Is dead Padawan restored? Idr her at all
[4:24:16] <%aWanderingKaivo> this is a real karen moment
[4:24:45] <scrublordsamurai> carth was the one whom the airlock longed for the most
[4:24:52] <rjhascancer> go space yourself???
[4:25:00] <%Undenizen> you know, that light saber is INCHES away from some of these NPCs fingers.
[4:25:04] <Broken_Sonex> @AzureGale That's so good. I'm stealing that

[4:26:10] <%dekkitout> But can you make the hilts curved tajRLY
[4:26:11] <+PaladinDupre> the red should be more red
[4:26:12] <%Undenizen> THERE SHE IS
[4:26:15] <Gruhunchously> YEYEYEYEYEYE
[4:26:16] <GarbageQueenEllie> Red is good, but porple is pretty. I like purple
[4:26:16] <SaltyAzteca> DARTH KAE'RYN
[4:26:16] <%Romuken> Does your big lightsaber have keen on it if you're going for massive crits?
[4:26:22] <%MrH00dz> yeyeyyeye
[4:26:27] <Gruhunchously> Look at this evil motherfucker
[4:26:29] <SaltyAzteca> Thems the sounds Kreygasm
[4:26:30] <subjectg> like i said, if you think of it as a katana + wakizashi combo, it works
[4:26:36] <%ChrisPlaysThing> @Broken_Sonex it's fine as long as it doesn't hurt real stats, like damage
[4:26:40] <%MrH00dz> Oh god that run is 1 inch away from a face off
[4:27:09] <%Romuken> @PatStaresAt if Peach doesn't like space, why is she gonna do the Mass Effects?
[4:27:14] <%aWanderingKaivo> rapier + parrying dagger
[4:27:20] <Broken_Sonex> @ChrisPlaysThing Yeah, but my point still stands
[4:27:23] <%Undenizen> could you imagine if someone was just RUNNING in a government building with a couple swords?
[4:27:30] <%MrPedrovsky> @subjectg Woolie said it doesn’t matter because it doesn’t look as cool and canonically Lightsabers have Length knob
[4:27:31] <%dekkitout> *Hears whooshing of lightsaberes in the distance* "Here comes Kae'Ryn, hide the children"
[4:27:48] <%Romuken> @dekkitout no man, hide your managers
[4:28:03] <%dekkitout> Just outright hide
[4:28:14] <dinnydanny777> A gun called a ripper is pretty terrifying
[4:28:18] <%ChrisPlaysThing> @ChrisPlaysThing If his need fucks up important gameplay then fuck it, i agree
[4:28:24] <subjectg> @mrpedrovsky HE doesn’t think it looks cool, and i couldn’t care less about that opinion
[4:28:25] <%Romuken> But don't hide like a bitch, she sniffs those out
[4:28:35] <%Huntercd> What about Visa?
[4:28:43] <+OG_M_Bison> You don't need to. I'd just buy all the lightsaber parts and the good crystals.
[4:29:01] <%MrH00dz> Nice, the line is LITERALLY off the chart
[4:29:02] <Broken_Sonex> @ChrisPlaysThing That's what mean, yes. He HAS done that in the past. Very frustrating.
[4:29:16] <+OG_M_Bison> The game is easy as hell. Especially as a sith force user
[4:29:27] <@commanderclaw> If you go Consular then it's a cakewalk by this point
[4:29:29] <TourettesPlays> Super good upgrades can be built at workbenches
[4:29:33] <MrBaldachin> you get overpowered no matter what, but you can get REALLY REALLY overpowered
[4:29:36] <%MrPedrovsky> @patstaresat Did you attune your Crystal with Kreia to your alignment??
[4:29:45] <%SirFancySwank> thers no need
[4:29:47] <%ChrisPlaysThing> @ChrisPlaysThing I know, that why i said attack specifically. Was a Monster hunter world Video fro mthe old channel reference
[4:29:47] <%Alazull> You really don't need to

[4:29:48] <+vaderxyz1970> Kill
[4:29:53] <+OG_M_Bison> @commanderclaw How good are the jedi force users? Cause their lightning damage is trash right?
[4:29:57] <heartlesshealer> oh it's the asshole jedi
[4:29:58] <subjectg> It’s not hard, but I just LOVE shattering this game into pieces with all the good shit
[4:30:08] <%MrH00dz> The face is paler than the ACTUAL CAVE walls
[4:30:08] <Gruhunchously> LUL
[4:30:09] <@commanderclaw> @OG_M_Bison It just costs more to use, the damage is the same
[4:30:09] <%MechArch> good
[4:30:11] <Psyramics> min-max the shit out of your gear so you can use an unupgraded Force Storm to mulch everything in a 5km radius
[4:30:19] <%cafefunk> Saying “how the hell” implies they believe in religion?
[4:30:28] <+OG_M_Bison> @commanderclaw Oh then yea then it's still op LUL
[4:30:28] <%dekkitout> The Mitch McConnell of Jedi psaFist

[4:32:19] <GarbageQueenEllie> Vrook kind of had this coming the most out of all of them
[4:32:27] <%dekkitout> Let this shit heel live for a more fitting reeming
[4:32:34] <scrublordsamurai> vrook is the WORST!
[4:32:34] <%MrH00dz> Paint a mural on the walls with him !
[4:32:40] <+OG_M_Bison> @GarbageQueenEllie Agreed. Maybe Atris is close tho?
[4:32:43] <scrublordsamurai> END HIM!
[4:32:48] <%BallerSwagBro9k> @garbagequeenellie Super did
[4:32:54] <+OG_M_Bison> Atris is kind of actually a tragic character tho
[4:32:58] <$narfi_steadfast> hey Pat. hope you've been doing good. ok bye.
[4:33:06] <GarbageQueenEllie> @OG_M_Bison Yeah, but Atris's bitchiness was funny. Vrook is just a wet blanket.
[4:33:22] <+OG_M_Bison> @GarbageQueenEllie Wet blanket LUL
[4:33:22] <MrBaldachin> we were not hiding, we were merely masking our presence
[4:33:44] <%BallerSwagBro9k> Visas vibing in the back LUL
[4:33:45] <%Ascethetic> @garbagequeenellie more like wet fart
[4:33:50] <%dekkitout> Echo- drink
[4:33:51] <Broken_Sonex> @GarbageQueenEllie And NO BODY likes a wet blanket.
[4:33:52] <heartlesshealer> echo
[4:34:07] <+OG_M_Bison> @GarbageQueenEllie I prefer a nice moist blanket
[4:34:26] <%dekkitout> "You are the manager, and I am speaking to you. Validate me!"
[4:34:35] <dinnydanny777> Is it weird that he drew his lightsaber on you first
[4:34:36] <scrublordsamurai> vrook excreats fart juice from his mouth everytime he speaks
[4:34:39] <Broken_Sonex> Take a shot for every echo you hear. You WILL die.
[4:34:46] <%MrPedrovsky> @garbagequeenellie More like cold wet sock
[4:34:52] <%MrH00dz> He says as you literally did a psaBig lighting to the entire room
[4:34:57] <+OG_M_Bison> @dinnydanny777 It's self defense Kappa
[4:34:58] <PirateMike_> He seems like a nice old man

[4:35:42] <%MrPedrovsky> @cursednobleman Force Step
[4:35:44] <SaltyAzteca> CUZ YA SUCK
[4:35:47] <%MassConnect> it's just a quirk of the game; you're in convo so you auto-put away the saber
[4:35:49] <CursedNobleman> remember that force bonds should be safe. sane. and consentual
[4:35:53] <%Maids4lyfe> the jedi don't find marriage natural he says

[4:36:08] <GarbageQueenEllie> Kae'ryn CRUSHES the puss!
[4:36:12] <dinnydanny777> Is force bondage canon considering how Kylo used it in the 7th movie?
[4:36:16] <%MrH00dz> Yep, there's the classic smug Jedi line. "I always felt there was darkness in you"
[4:36:19] <%Monkeyweed21> you're gonna miss the best scene in the game

[5:08:51] <heartlesshealer> Do you have a force knockback move?
[5:08:59] <+rainlily1245> Battle Meditation
[5:09:00] <Gruhunchously> I was waiting for this. Vrook is a real pain in the ass to take down, especially in the early game.
[5:09:06] <%super_ej8> can't you pause the game and do combat menu to make your allies help you? I forget how KOTOR works though
[5:09:09] <+AnthraxJohnson> Suck his dick!
[5:09:19] <MrBaldachin> @super_ej8 you're alone here
[5:09:29] <KaitlynnHere> @anthraxjohnson there’s no way he’d see that coming
[5:09:35] <Vyskus> vrook is gonna save against all your force powers, so you just gotta go for big damage
[5:09:35] <%super_ej8> @MrBaldachin oh, my bad
[5:09:42] <%MrH00dz> @AnthraxJohnson the most powerful stun there is
[5:09:49] <jowi_time> UNLIMITED POWERRR
[5:09:51] <KaitlynnHere> Lmao
[5:09:51] <%MrPedrovsky> I can’t remember. Does Dark side get Force Enlightenment?
[5:09:52] <+corrosivePaladin> would lifesteal do better seeing how hes nuking you?

[5:11:16] <%GarbageNirvana> turns out yous just a bitch
[5:11:17] <+vaderxyz1970> I was watching out of the corner of my eye and I thought Pat was wearing fishnet stockings
[5:11:34] <@commanderclaw> The fact that a Jedi duel in this system involves both Jedi taking several turns to buff themselves like they're doing Naruto hand poses is goofy as shit
[5:11:40] <DasFreekman> this man said you can learn better than I can, you gotta die
[5:11:43] <KeiPrime> pat you killed the old man from up!

[5:25:00] <kenny_biff> @Vyskus hk units killed pat and his save was at the start of the fight

[5:25:45] <%Monkeyweed21> killing Vrook counts for Light Side
[5:25:46] <Gruhunchously> I would say that this game is so easy that builds don't really matter...but...
[5:25:49] <Coystick> It's goofy
[5:25:51] <%xcompleasedad> BECAuse you die

[5:26:46] <%MrH00dz> imagine not saving after every corner
[5:26:48] <%Soliloquy123> Does the combat theme's crescendo warble a bit or am I absolutely crazy
[5:27:03] <@commanderclaw> It's better than a shield cause a single hit doesn't kill it

[5:27:36] <Psyramics> you thought it was a party buff that visas gave you
[5:27:44] <%MrH00dz> I hope Kreia chokes him
