[0:11:06] <@SSaryn> Why would you smoke entire trees? Kappa
[0:11:06] <gunzerkingdunce> To watch or to play the game myself
[0:11:07] <%sshen> It's not a chest bug, it's a surprise feature
[0:11:07] <devanmuse> @QuadraticGravity upon furhter investigation, it seems both are acceptable forms of spelling
[0:11:07] <Louie_Salmon> I did have the PC version crash once when I tried to read a book
[0:11:08] <%GohanEgret> pat butt chugs Kappa

[0:12:00] <%rumtumtugnutz> DRUNKEYES
[0:12:01] <%ElenaManetta> Stoners aren't chill, they're super stressed out people. That's why they smoke!
[0:12:06] <+Rachet20> It has no E because thats how the court says it u dums
[0:12:06] <devanmuse> Apparently both forms of the word -- with and without the extra E -- are grammatically correct
[0:12:06] <Tennochief> fuck EA

[0:14:29] <Zaphire_Saucypants> lil bit
[0:14:31] <InugamiTheHound> the netflix version is bad. I saw the original version on adult swim the original anime
[0:14:32] <+aslfrasle> That's kind of funny about law school, because I'm almost done with law school!
[0:14:33] <+burritocheetos> dont watch EVA netflx
[0:14:35] <%cvp5127> just torrent it LUL

[0:14:51] <gustavozxd> hmmmn ok
[0:14:52] <%THATGUY_789> oh yeah I was there
[0:14:52] <%Deekman> Eva is fucking so good
[0:14:54] <KaseKaizer> did*
[0:14:54] <Ion_Laser> What's wrong with the Netflix version?
[0:14:55] <Zaphire_Saucypants> I actually grew up with the old dub. And I see this new one, and I find it to be acceptable.
[0:14:56] <$cureneckbeard> That would turn you into Pat
[0:14:57] <zamzoph> Asuka Kreygasm
[0:14:57] <$Sir_stride> its probably a mind fuck
[0:14:57] <%doc_ock_rokc> How have people not watched it?
[0:14:58] <%ElenaManetta> And then you drop cartoons because it's for BABIES
[0:14:59] <+Jordan_z123> Kiwami means Rei is trash
[0:14:59] <%NovaKnightmare> Im so fucked up
[0:14:59] <+FadingEmber> I actively don't care cause everyone over hyped it
[0:14:59] <Luesagna00> @angriestpat u should watch evegalian pat its just the show you would enjoy
[0:15:01] <+Rachet20> Im just gonna avoid the dumb anime like I have for the past 20 years
[0:15:02] <%Spec7re> I watched EVA when i was like 8 and it fucked me up super hard
[0:15:04] <%rumtumtugnutz> fun fact: you don't have to go to law school to be a lawyer. you just have to pass a bar exam.
[0:15:04] <LokimenD> End of Eva ruined me
[0:15:06] <%doc_ock_rokc> It was all over the channels for a while
[0:15:06] <%Deekman> I'm stoked it's on netflix. I just hope this means we get a Bluray release
[0:15:06] <Sulliman34> im super upset with netflix evangelion's subtitling. it tries to hide/downplay homosexual themes which is horseshit
[0:15:06] <%nmaten> i wouldnt have understood half of it when i was 10
[0:15:06] <Avoxis> DRK, WAR, BLM or BRD. Which should I go into Shadowbringers with?
[0:15:07] <%Reanimator83> A fancy computer that can barely run A Hat in Time NotLikeThis

[0:15:13] <%bread_assassin> Are Pat & Woolie going to remember the Basement spoilercast on Monday's podcast?
[0:15:13] <%ElenaManetta> and then you watch Elfen Lied and go ANIME IS SO MATURE
[0:15:14] <Mr_Strut> It gives you a fetish for bitchy redheads
[0:15:16] <%THATGUY_789> that's why we're all here
[0:15:17] <filialpails> remember everyone, shinji and kaworu are just pals
[0:15:17] <seylumiue> It shapes the taste in waifus
[0:15:18] <%spiritofmojave> I skipped out on it in formative years, woo!
[0:15:22] <%doc_ock_rokc> Shut up and get into the mech
[0:15:22] <+QuietWyatt211> "you're so fucked up"

[0:15:54] <Tennochief> my back hurts
[0:15:56] <Zaphire_Saucypants> in the third ep, and it's actually good acting. First ep wasn't such a great example...And they're definitely sticking closer to the original japanese, which sacrifices some REALLY good lines from the old dub.
[0:15:59] <%Kyma1020> I watched Eva when it was on Adult Swim and I was 11. Yeah it fucked me up and I loved it

[0:24:47] <KaseKaizer> it's the name of a fucking website
[0:24:47] <oceanmatt> bullshit
[0:24:49] <$valriot> FF7 has one spoiler people ACTUALLY remember
[0:24:53] <LokimenD> good bullshit
[0:24:54] <alrobot2014> the difference is ff7 is widely legally available
[0:24:54] <serrule1> Hey Pat! Are you excited about Dio Maddin?
[0:24:55] <%KendallLitDinner> It's way easier to get ahold of FF7
[0:24:56] <%ElenaManetta> There's way too much in FF7 and half the shit does't make sense if you don't get the context
[0:24:57] <CaptainFrankincense> yeah cause its bad
[0:24:59] <%SvenHolgersson> Also Eva isn't super great
[0:24:59] <+gearcannon> I think the spoilers have been meme'd to much
[0:25:02] <Zaphire_Saucypants> now, if they were to fucking put all the various "Fly me to the Moon" shit at the end, I would be happy.
[0:25:04] <gustavozxd> FF7 is one of the most well known games of all time
[0:25:05] <Luesagna00> @angriestpat ya know there IS breathable liquid cuz has enough oxygen contain to sustain ya
[0:25:06] <%SvenHolgersson> so fuck it
[0:25:06] <%Psyramics> there's gonna be so much new shit in FF7R
[0:25:08] <+Darren716> Doesnt everyone know about about the Eva spoilers?

[0:31:18] <%TheKillerKalamari> So basically, STOP BREAKING THE LAW ASSHOLES

[0:31:22] <alrobot2014> well fuck

[0:32:08] <Karakuioshi> LUL
[0:32:08] <reonome> i'm a little freaked out at how much i look like saori
[0:32:11] <dukenux> Being attorney is the Dark Souls of japanese legal system.
[0:32:12] <+chaumiester> So.... do defense attorneys make money if they always lose?
[0:32:14] <+Chewygamer> its not 99.9%
[0:32:15] <%Typhaeon> Confessions
[0:32:15] <+KursedKaiju> @Deekman yep
[0:32:17] <Medo3G> why even have lawyers
[0:32:18] <squirtkitten> another reason the country is going down the shitter lmao
[0:32:19] <%AncelDeLambert> I can't IMAGINE why the yakuza are willing to murder people

[0:32:22] <jase__x> ooh
[0:32:22] <%Dr00_PhD> HOT
[0:32:23] <+Chewygamer> r/chapotraphouse
[0:32:23] <Tennochief> yes
[0:32:24] <VeryTricky> cirHuh
[0:32:24] <+sindrantz> "never wrong"
[0:32:24] <+Darren716> Why would anyone become a defense attorney in Japan?
[0:32:24] <+totesmcgoat_> oof
[0:32:25] <%nmaten> but what about when theyre wrong tho
[0:32:26] <skeith77> Kreygasm Kreygasm
[0:32:27] <@commanderclaw> Canada has a 97% conviction rate
[0:32:27] <LiquidMathew> How could the police be wrong? Its their job
[0:32:27] <%Typhaeon> Shut the fuck up jackasses
[0:32:30] <dmtjinni> FUCK YES Judgment! THX @AngriestPat
[0:32:31] <tactician0> why is game just phoenix write AA street justice
[0:32:32] <%HiroTSK5> If you got caught it's because you did it
[0:32:32] <$Chimeraelite> LUL
[0:32:34] <Dest_121> pay attention @AngriestPat
[0:32:35] <+Gruntini> Persona 5 legal system is real
[0:32:39] <%shawntk_> @Medo3G because of that .1
[0:32:39] <Mr_Strut> It's more because they don't make arrests unless they have overwhelming evidence.
[0:32:40] <%NovaKnightmare> Exposure Lawyers
[0:32:41] <%GarbageNirvana> So in other words if you're in Japan keep your head down
[0:32:42] <%Divryne> To make the sentence more lenient.
[0:32:42] <%TheKillerKalamari> that's why most people just keep their head low and mind their own business
[0:32:44] <BunnyEmperor> So as defense attorney you just need to be "there"
[0:32:45] <%alcors_wisdom> basically to appear above the board
[0:32:45] <reonome> DUN DUN DUN
[0:32:45] <%galaxyswirl> reallu @commanderclaw
[0:32:45] <Dr_Mooose> :O
[0:32:46] <%spiritofmojave> Constitutionality or something, 'fair trial'
[0:32:46] <Tennochief> HUH
[0:32:47] <Calern> Pat, how much of Ace attorney have you playedd?
[0:32:48] <filialpails> it's because prosecutors don't bring a case to trial unless they're sure they can win it
[0:32:48] <+totesmcgoat_> NaNi?
[0:32:49] <+SomeOtherNeb> whoops
[0:32:49] <Mopopolis> N-NANI!?
[0:32:50] <+Chewygamer> ohooo PogChamp
[0:32:51] <Louie_Salmon> So this Yagami guy is hot shit huh
[0:32:53] <%Deekman> @AngriestPat no it's because they won't prosecute unless they have undeniable proof
[0:32:54] <$cureneckbeard> I bet you thought the Cardassian legal system was a satire
[0:32:55] <Da1TruPhoenix> is this yakuzee??
[0:32:56] <dukenux> Its SATIRE(and not mean that in cheeky way)
[0:32:58] <mudox1717> kek
[0:33:01] <+SomeOtherNeb> that'll do it
[0:33:01] <%Nikopol1717> I keep thinking Death Note every time I hear Yagami

[0:33:02] <leole11> OH MAN
[0:33:03] <+BHPicasso> nu-murder
[0:33:04] <%TheKillerKalamari> thats why Logan Paul could walk around being a tool and no one said anything to him

[0:33:05] <%machshop> JUST NOW?
[0:33:05] <Tennochief> big arson
[0:33:05] <%THATGUY_789> Japan is a lawyer debuff
[0:33:05] <Dr_Mooose> woah
[0:33:05] <LeeOhX> So is this a yakua spin off? or a new game in the same engine?
[0:33:05] <benjiFG> I like this girl

[0:33:11] <Louie_Salmon> Well that's gonna be hard to defend
[0:33:11] <@Moobot> Whoa I don't even shout that much! (@brave_sj) (warning)
[0:33:13] <%mayorrev> @AngriestPat does this mean that Japan essentially has Judge Dredd living there
[0:33:14] <Tennochief> SUPRISE BONFIRE
[0:33:14] <omen_setter> The post-1868 adoption of the Western justice system had some hitches along the way
[0:33:15] <+CourageTheCat> oh shit
[0:33:18] <+zyberion626> Y'knoq how Phoenix had to literally solve the crime and essentially prosecute someone else to get a not guilty verdict?
[0:33:18] <+chaumiester> So... what you're saying is.... If I get accused by the police... There is no hope so I might as well die fighting on that hill
[0:33:20] <$Chimeraelite> YIKES
[0:33:20] <LokimenD> that's some hard murder
[0:33:20] <+KursedKaiju> @Deekman It seems a lot of people just see "99% Conviction rate" and stop there,
[0:33:21] <devanmuse> the one miracle conviction, and the guy was SUPER GUILTY
[0:33:24] <reonome> this is some phoenix wright level bullshit
[0:33:25] <%spiritofmojave> These models look so good compared to even Y6
[0:33:26] <+solzan2000> no its guilty until proven guilty lol
[0:33:26] <Spiralpower1620> I guess Sar Nijima‚Äôs in for a hard time

[0:33:31] <%Shadowthedigger> Pat they are nothing alike.
[0:33:33] <%bread_assassin> IS the English script different? I watched the Giant Bomb quick look on this earlier today, and I remember her saying "Can it" instead of "shut up".
[0:33:33] <Tennochief> wow
[0:33:35] <madejustforchat> so japan is like Mega city 1?
[0:33:36] <dredshift> He's just GOTTA celebrate getting out of jail with murder

[0:34:20] <%alcors_wisdom> no blood on his hands
[0:34:20] <%castarts> That's pretty strong
[0:34:23] <$cureneckbeard> And the moral of the story is that acquittals are wrong
[0:34:23] <%connos_procrastination> hes obviously innocent
[0:34:23] <rosemon5001> @AngriestPat MURDER GO UP sanity go down
[0:34:24] <+Darren716> I hope the twist is that he actually did it

[0:34:42] <Zaphire_Saucypants> there's a 3rd?
[0:34:42] <+totesmcgoat_> Those eyes say guilty
[0:34:43] <%Niney_Who> That means he's WORSE than the criminal
[0:34:44] <Dest_121> he killed 2 people thats not a serial killer
[0:34:44] <@commanderclaw> Spiderman problems
[0:34:45] <%mh9s> got him off?
[0:34:45] <CalderGaming> STILL DECEMBER
[0:34:46] <madejustforchat> but what if a mayan shaman controlled him??
[0:34:46] <%rumtumtugnutz> he got a guy off?
[0:34:49] <+chaumiester> So.... if you get accused by the Police for crimes... How do the people in Yakuza keep getting out?

[0:37:27] <@commanderclaw> commanderclaw subscribed at Tier 1. They've subscribed for 17 months! To be fair, the US' conviction rate is 93% and Canada's is 97%, but that doesn't count cases where charges are dropped. Also, the primary reason Japan has such a high conviction rate is that the understaffed justices system only brings slam dunks to court

[1:36:21] <%shiplord13> Japan
[1:36:21] <CalderGaming> @angriestpat he treats being a lawyer like kiryu treats being a yakuza
[1:36:22] <Onamar> What constitution? It's Japan
[1:36:23] <+TastySammiches> japanese law is WEIRD dude
[1:36:23] <%SvenHolgersson> D O O T Y
[1:36:24] <Zaphire_Saucypants> this is true
[1:36:25] <%shadowace2400> but this is japan
[1:36:25] <Dr_Mooose> justice thouhg
[1:36:26] <%Spec7re> You are a lawyer so you already arent a good person
[1:36:26] <Patzzki217> Japan
[1:36:27] <%THATGUY_789> it's yr job
[1:36:27] <alexandrecau> I mean yhat serail killer wans't innocent
[1:36:28] <televisedrevolting> But that's fucked though
[1:36:29] <astrophizz> but it's japan
[1:36:29] <%shiplord13> No U.S. or Canada... Japan
[1:36:30] <Tennochief> anyone else keeps on getting random freezing?
[1:36:30] <Morning_Asakura> but japan
[1:36:32] <%shadowace2400> they're wierd
[1:36:33] <$soupjunkie> holy shit hold up
[1:36:34] <%brave_sj> You did a really good job by letting that murderer go free, Yagami
[1:36:35] <SweepTheLegoMyEggo> no but fuck them, they're guilty
[1:36:38] <Bouldus> only if youre a court appointed lawyer, defense lawyers are allowed to turn people down
[1:36:38] <$soupjunkie> Emi-chan returns
[1:36:39] <taquito_blade> isn't it guilty til proven innocent in Japan?
[1:36:40] <%Engwithan_Elder_God> But then again, Japan's justice system has like a 99% conviction rate.
[1:36:40] <HedgehogGames1> BUT GUILTY THO
[1:36:40] <astrophizz> so like Cardassian conviction rates
[1:36:40] <%Teintstein> but this is japan, if you're arrested you *must* be guilty
[1:36:40] <guppy_> but japan is guilty til proven innocent :)
[1:36:43] <Kaito_Cam> Phoenix Wright Yagami is not

[1:36:49] <InugamiTheHound> I wish it was easy to get a job
[1:36:50] <Marpolo13> HELL YEAH
[1:36:50] <+maleficarqm> Wait is it. because he defended him or because he wholeheartedly believed the guy wasn't a crazy psycho killer?
[1:36:50] <laserbeaming> Zombie Emi-chan will save him
[1:36:52] <dredshift> Lawyers are actually supposed to throw their defendants under the bus if they know for a fact they're guilty
[1:36:55] <Tennochief> VILLAIN
[1:36:55] <%Shadicara> But how else can he become detective Jackie chan?
[1:36:55] <xeros720> BIG TRASH
[1:36:55] <%alcors_wisdom> well yes but unless youre working probono you have the right to pick and choose your clients and you can refuse to defend parties you think are "guilty
[1:36:57] <starotter70> It's like Phoenix always says, "Blindly Believe in your client!"

[1:55:09] <serrule1> With his fighting style, I noticed the game does punish you more for missing your moves because of the cooldown after.
[1:55:10] <stabbityrabbit> Wait, why does he fight like Kiryu?
[1:55:11] <+Double_Tap_That> He obviously follows Kiryu's blog

[1:56:06] <Cptn_Turtle> 88 was 0 I thought
[1:56:06] <colzack_> yakuza 1 was 1995 to 2005
[1:56:07] <ameraaaaaa> hey everyone if you could star in a yukuza game what would be your fighting style
[1:56:09] <AzirothTheGreat> 95 was Yakuza 1
[1:56:10] <LokimenD> huh, I thought the time gap would be longer
[1:56:13] <majima666> yakuza 1 was 95 and 2005
[1:56:13] <%Josef_Stryker> Yakuza 1 started in 95 I think

[1:59:54] <$Sphincter_Spelunker> Why y'all talking about Dragon Maid? I thought that was old news. Like how the big tittied one was turned into a "feminist" instead of being an airhead
[2:00:15] <%TheStarbecue> @rumtumtugnutz ah i see
[2:00:28] <%Agami23> were talking about dragon maid because evangellion got the same treatment with the new dub @Sphincter_Spelunker
[2:00:30] <%IrishWeegee> is there somewhere I can listen to a 10 minute loop of this song? It's so nice and chill... tekkComfy

[2:00:58] <Gregorhasjoined> Dragon maid's dub was simulcast, they really didn't try much
[2:01:01] <@Moobot> Whoa I don't even shout that much! (@Nanocomputer) (warning)
[2:01:03] <pandangerous> or am I think of the boss one I don't remember
[2:01:05] <%SergeantSov> I cant imagine a season 2 for Dragon Maid not having at least one character be heavily censored
[2:01:06] <+Jordan_z123> Wait is the Eva dub that bad ? Because the original was ok
[2:01:06] <%Remery_> well that's why i watch sub

[2:01:16] <Demon_chann> @Agami23 wow you gotta be more specific
[2:01:25] <+Promessa_EX> i don't know if it was dragon maid, but a recent dub references gamergate for no goddam reason

[2:11:27] <alexandrecau> omi fuck
[2:11:29] <Derkinstacker> If they told him cocain instead of Murder, he'd have already been caught.

[2:11:55] <+Grayhammatter> big brain
[2:11:57] <0rond> wait, this takes place in the same universe as yakuza? is kiryu in this game?
[2:12:05] <Luesagna00> @angriestpat wait wtf?? you have to ask questions in the right order? hardly a mini game
[2:12:08] <%tigerfang86> oh, one of THOSE law boys
[2:12:11] <%Spec7re> This guy is an ACTUAL lawyer
[2:12:21] <Ion_Laser> @0rond This game is 2 years after 6
[2:12:31] <Gregorhasjoined> kiryu's spirit is somewhere in the game
[2:12:34] <bestwaifuritsu> He's a real lawyer, do you have time to take a look at his LAWYER BUTTON?
[2:12:37] <%Shadicara> There's definitely gonna be a crossover in 7
[2:12:39] <a_mad_dragon> kiryu is legally dead
[2:12:41] <+Mukkeym1212> How‚Äôs the game so far
[2:12:43] <%sourceofall> kiryu needs to be a secret super boss, clearly
[2:12:46] <xeros720> seems like it is just bonus points for getting backstory
[2:12:51] <+Grayhammatter> one whole people
[2:12:55] <kylejefferies> Is this Yakuza Ace Attorney Investigations?
[2:12:56] <zedravan> @Luesagna00 this might just be tutorial and you get to ask all the questions this time
[2:12:59] <Gregorhasjoined> murder happened: +1 detail
[2:13:01] <ameraaaaaa> any advice for white mage I'm back
[2:13:02] <%THATGUY_789> with yr 1 jobs
[2:13:04] <42nfl19> @AngriestPat what timeline does this game fit in? 5? 6?
[2:13:05] <ZazzyDoesStuff> Okay boys. I just got here and I have less than an idea what's happening.
[2:13:06] <alexandrecau> look at tha cocaine smile
[2:13:16] <%Shadicara> white mage heal big
[2:13:31] <Jolnir> white mage dont die
[2:13:33] <COMB711> What if Judgement man is the Baby from Song of Life?
[2:13:40] <EynosStyles> White mage DPS!!
[2:13:41] <Gregorhasjoined> @ZazzyDoesStuff Shit was wild, it's basically yakoozy but western noir, and pat's drinking again
[2:13:56] <xeros720> heal early, latency can make hp drop in bursts
[2:13:57] <ameraaaaaa> ok i heard you have to use the right amount of heals
[2:14:06] <%snow_bush> THE GOUT
[2:14:15] <OwlLightningMage> Twice = 10 times
[2:14:15] <ameraaaaaa> to not waste mana
[2:14:17] <Gregorhasjoined> big gout
[2:14:19] <%Spec7re> Alcohol makes Pat angry and need to SMASH
[2:14:21] <InugamiTheHound> get drunk dude and have fun
[2:14:28] <Zebroneath> How good of a "detective" game is this?
[2:14:30] <Mopopolis> I dont drink because if I do I have to piss every 15 minutes
[2:14:33] <%Niney_Who> Shangri-La STILL THERE
[2:14:42] <+Mukkeym1212> This is in Kamarucho, right?
[2:14:42] <lethallylactic> monkaS
[2:14:49] <Gregorhasjoined> O_O
[2:14:50] <%spinalwizard> it BURNS
[2:14:54] <Ion_Laser> You need to see a doctor about that piss Sir...
[2:15:00] <%Spec7re> Little crystals on my peepee
[2:15:00] <xeros720> there is some mechanics there to save mp, but just use cure if that is enough, bigger heals for more
[2:15:06] <+Darren716> I hope Date is here
[2:15:06] <InugamiTheHound> people still uses taxis huh?
[2:15:13] <BappoSama> @AngriestPat How're you enjoying the game so far brother?
[2:15:18] <Ion_Laser> She don't like she don't like she don't like...
[2:15:27] <dmysta3000> Is this the guy how got replaced cuz of the coke?
[2:15:36] <alexandrecau> uber would suck in japan, only taxi driver have cars
[2:15:44] <LokimenD> JUSTICE is all that matters
[2:15:45] <Derkinstacker> Innocent of murder, guilty of cocain
[2:15:52] <MikeStrider> this is so weird after having played the whole japanese game with the old actor
[2:15:54] <%Shadicara> Heal and just never let regen drop off the tanks. You can dps too but keeping people alive is the priority of healers, dps comes second
[2:15:55] <QaizerArt> guilty of all the cocaine
[2:16:05] <Djinnazz> this the guy they replaced the VO?
[2:16:07] <xeros720> i'm gonna laugh if this is just a coke deal gone wrong
[2:16:15] <LokimenD> Dark Age of The Law
[2:16:16] <fruit_pie_the_magician> The cops dont hand you fuck all in japan
[2:16:18] <%SergeantSov> That's actually kinda normal
[2:16:18] <Dr_Mooose> technically yes
[2:16:24] <RupanSen> they would probably still ask
[2:16:28] <Tennochief> nice
[2:16:32] <+haseoseerlane> Thats not how that works lol
[2:16:34] <ÂàáÊç®Âæ°ÂÖç> BEST LAWYER
[2:16:36] <%AncelDeLambert> both options are grounds for disbarment
[2:16:36] <+Darren716> This guy is a terrible defense lawyer LUL
[2:16:37] <+mik255> does the defense side have a kick me sign or something?
[2:16:41] <primarch_lupercal> he's not a lawyer anymore
[2:16:42] <Mopopolis> AWWW YEAH!!
[2:16:44] <%elxinon> ah.. he put on the japanese dub like a huge weeaboo
[2:16:44] <+Mukkeym1212> I have to wait until Tuesday to play this :/
[2:16:44] <%AncelDeLambert> this guy is a SHIT lawyer
[2:16:47] <primarch_lupercal> so he can do whatever he wants
[2:16:47] <Derkinstacker> Serial killer is better than a dirty coke doer
[2:16:51] <%ArcanumMBD> I love the desaturation going on here in this scene
[2:16:56] <%spinalwizard> bad hype man
[2:16:56] <%Spec7re> Okay so as someone who is getting into Law and PI stuff this is actually making anxious haha
[2:16:57] <%ArcanumMBD> or whatever is going on with the colors
[2:17:03] <alexandrecau> he had crazy eyes
[2:17:12] <+Mukkeym1212> @arcanummbd Same
[2:17:19] <fruit_pie_the_magician> Even if this dude didn't do anything they can hold you for like 80 days in japan without even charging you with anything, and they can extend that another 80 days as many times as they want for literally no reason
[2:17:20] <dmysta3000> Drugs r bad kids!
[2:17:22] <%AncelDeLambert> dude, YOU DON'T GET TO SAY THAT ANYMORE
[2:17:23] <+SomeOtherNeb> LUL
[2:17:24] <Tennochief> certainly not alive in America
[2:17:25] <%shiplord13> @AngriestPat Is it a good idea to tell him you are purposely trying to get him locked up? I mean he is still a Yakuza.
[2:17:26] <%GarbageNirvana> It's too bad he couldn't be a pedophile
[2:17:26] <Jolnir> theres probably a 10-30 year difference
[2:17:27] <%Shadicara> Yakuzie Eyes Vs Judgement Eyes
[2:17:28] <%brave_sj> He's not a lawyer, he's a PI. Corrupt lawyer morals don't apply to him
[2:17:28] <hntronium> No
[2:17:30] <krymzen5> damn
[2:17:33] <%spinalwizard> I want to explain it to you tho
[2:17:35] <+haseoseerlane> They all look like they need some serious naps
[2:17:39] <TheRagingLeo> like in real life? Kappa
[2:17:40] <+GovernmentmYass> dick masterson is kind of a bad person
[2:17:44] <%ArcanumMBD> @AngriestPat If the past is coming up this much in like a day of you playing as this guy, imagine how much it came up in the past 3 years
[2:17:52] <alexandrecau> Pat your whole life is sordid
[2:17:53] <%AncelDeLambert> oh no, you just had a Phoenix Wright moment
[2:17:54] <Tennochief> that was weird
[2:17:55] <LokimenD> So, do Lawyers have like something similar to the hypocritical oath?
[2:17:57] <krymzen5> Dick is americas fav mexican
[2:18:01] <%rumtumtugnutz> you have a sordid past?
[2:18:04] <%AncelDeLambert> quick, find a child to turn into a babe using spirit magic!
[2:18:09] <Bouldus> LIAR
[2:18:10] <Bouldus> Kappa
[2:18:14] <fruit_pie_the_magician> Lawyers are way less useful in japan
[2:18:19] <@Moobot> Whoa I don't even shout that much! (@OwlLightningMage) (warning)
[2:18:22] <xeros720> life of sin and videogames
[2:18:36] <12gagerager> is it assorted, like a box of chocolates?
[2:18:47] <%Spec7re> He needs to fund his addiction to Redbull somehow
[2:18:53] <wildrage66> DansGame
[2:18:53] <%AncelDeLambert> fucking GARBAGE
[2:18:56] <OwlLightningMage> Never forget the time Pat taught people how to murder children
[2:18:56] <+CourageTheCat> wtf???
[2:18:57] <%machshop> japan is boned
[2:18:58] <LokimenD> Dark. Age. @AngriestPat
[2:19:00] <Tennochief> smart
[2:19:00] <%ArcanumMBD> Japan's legal system is fuuucked
[2:19:02] <%AncelDeLambert> NUKE'EM AGAIN! Do it until they learn better!
[2:19:05] <BappoSama> That's super harsh..
[2:19:09] <%Spec7re> Wow thats awful haha
[2:19:15] <BappoSama> That's like getting fed after already dying of starvation
[2:19:16] <+Ell1ot> i'm confused. is this a yakuzee game?
[2:19:16] <alexandrecau> @LokimenD they can't help you lie in court, so if you say you killed they are gonna have to make deals
[2:19:17] <Asper_Usual> I would say arguing that blindly trusting your client is bad when you are asking the lawyer to blindly trust you is a bad move
[2:19:42] <ShichiNoBushi> He should have had a receipt or checked in or something to the sauna.
[2:20:02] <%Shadicara> No this is a Judgement Game
[2:20:03] <%AncelDeLambert> this is yakuzee adjacent
[2:20:04] <a_mad_dragon> he's yakuza, you think he paid?
[2:20:05] <fruit_pie_the_magician> if you get arrested in japan you're basically fucked. The reason they have such a high conviction rate is because a confession is like 90 percent of a conviction, and they will hold you as long as they want until you confess just so you can get out eventually
[2:20:07] <+haseoseerlane> Yakuza not!
[2:20:09] <krymzen5> L.A yakuza
[2:20:09] <%Spec7re> Judgemento!
[2:20:13] <dmysta3000> Lawyerkuza
[2:20:14] <whycans> also no karaoke, so no not yakuza
[2:20:16] <%salty_syd913> lawyer detective boy
[2:20:18] <beetbo2> Phoenix Wright PI Version
[2:20:23] <%Shadicara> Instead of Yakuzie you Judge people
[2:20:23] <Gregorhasjoined> yakoosy adjacent
[2:20:24] <ShichiNoBushi> Juh-kuzi
[2:20:26] <beetbo2> CROSS YAKUZA
[2:20:29] <%spinalwizard> That guy want to be kyriu so bad
[2:20:35] <+SomeOtherNeb> whoops
[2:20:37] <TheMightyMungus> so its a yakuzee
[2:20:39] <LokimenD> The game is part of the Yazukie Expanded Universe
[2:20:40] <RupanSen> Subsidiary of the Yakuza Family
[2:20:42] <+wotn_weisskaiser> And if they think they can't solve the case they'll just say it isn't one >90% conviction rate
[2:20:46] <Ion_Laser> Bitch are you for real?
[2:20:49] <%GoodShotCam> GoodShotCam subscribed with Twitch Prime.

[2:31:25] <%rumtumtugnutz> since kiryu was a virgon
[2:31:26] <AutechreTwinAphex> Shenmue 3 with a relatively big budget could have been interesting, with a shoestring indie budget though it loses all of its appeal

[2:37:48] <%Shadicara> Kiryu is just hanging out with his Yakuzie eyes
[2:37:49] <+wotn_weisskaiser> People trying to sell shit wear them anyway

[3:11:41] <%TheWinged7> i wanna call it, that the lady murdered at the start isnt dead and is the one gouging out yakuza eys
[3:11:44] <%Spec7re> @Niney_Who You have to fight the judge and the court
[3:11:49] <%shurtal> Better have Pocket Racer
[3:11:51] <%shiplord13> Its clear the Yakuza didn't do it, but I am interested in how that is possible.

[3:46:48] <+ultimafullmetal> I just beat the Heavensward campaign yesterday for the first time. If someone told me you fight against the knights of the round I would have played it sooner.

[3:47:27] <beetbo2> the crack
[3:47:28] <%Engwithan_Elder_God> Correct. All Prosecutors want the easy win and high conviction rate.
[3:47:32] <LiquidMathew> didn't it turn out he didn't even have the drugs?
[3:47:38] <supersonic21> mostly because that game takes place in britian
[3:47:41] <+UrielCobalt> The funny thing is that the Yakuza head hangs out with Yakuza
[3:47:44] <zamzoph> It's why they post the maximum sentence for a charge no matter how improbable it is to actually GET that maximum

[4:05:32] <DrFaustMD> he's still in the street though
[4:05:36] <+Sulfur_Boride> Would that attack after saving him have killed him cause his heart rate might have shot up there?
[4:05:36] <Blank9> no one steals yagami's frags
[4:05:40] <%spiritofmojave> Kiryu would throw him into the car, then kill him twice
[4:05:41] <Khorneflakes_> Just didn't want that car to steal his kill
[4:05:43] <%kiiiirsten> PogChamp I thought Pat was done but he was just thanking the pee pole
[4:05:44] <+Pookiedaexzile> No Kiryu would have got in the car and ran him over himself
[4:05:48] <$Dutchpotato> I'm glad to hear that Pat :D

[4:05:59] <%jaytitan96> "Oh shit I dont want to kill him" *Proceeds to explode stomach with knee"
[4:06:01] <%Midboss87> Kiryu would build a car just to run him over
