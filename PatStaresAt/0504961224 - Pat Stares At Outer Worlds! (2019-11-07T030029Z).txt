[0:11:23] <%3Xgilly> @AngriestPat Do you think there would be a possibility that you will bail streaming Death Stranding at some point in the game or are you going all out?

[0:11:46] <$RubberFistFight> "Oh man! Popeyes chicken is fucken awesome!"
[0:11:48] <%King_Wolf_Rigger> Popeye's is not as good as Churche's

[0:12:07] <zamzoph> @AngriestPat Would you describe The Phantom Pain as streaming poison?
[0:12:08] <%Puhff> That movie is 10+ years old
[0:12:09] <Zaphire_Saucypants> Tried their chicken sandwich, spicy version. Was good.
[0:12:12] <KaiserMario> @AngriestPat You have pre-downloaded yet?
[0:12:15] <%rumtumtugnutz> Popeyes chicken is overrated, but it's better than KFC.
[0:12:16] <%Zaxshimysham> Maow apatWink apatWink
[0:12:16] <+zabemareu> I doubt pat hasn't seen the black ppl freaking out over popeyes running outta chicken

[0:12:44] <TechDragon_Z> Am I early or late? Did he play already?
[0:12:44] <$RubberFistFight> @zabemareu when a chicken store runs out of their primary product, it indicates severe mismanagement in the supply chain.

[0:12:47] <%3Xgilly> @AngriestPat how fast will it download lol
[0:12:49] <%darcfowler1995> it's impossible for you to get smaller

[0:14:01] <%Taglog7> apatBlep
[0:14:02] <%Zaxshimysham> apatGib beep beep
[0:14:04] <TwinBat> he beeps
[0:14:04] <Alrewix> Elmo sounded upset for a moment
[0:14:05] <Nina96> i thought elmo farted
[0:14:05] <$RubberFistFight> @zabemareu then they shouldn't have offered the special. What part of "mismanagement" is unclear to you?
[0:14:10] <%TIME_PUNCHER> Leave a message after the beep
[0:14:11] <AMadHollow> it was very Cyoot pat
[0:14:12] <%demegodz> He beep like sheep
[0:14:13] <+Sento_vidya> I’m gonna get it physically in case I hate it
[0:14:14] <cureneckbeard> beep beep
[0:14:17] <Zaktheaussie> so is outer Worlds the best Fallout?
[0:14:17] <Cerabret100> I took a week off for death stranding so here's hoping i like it.
[0:14:17] <%MakotoPB> smug laughing emote should be next
[0:14:18] <corepercentlives> he farted?
[0:14:23] <%lambretime> kINDA.
[0:14:23] <%ssjklyco> Hello
[0:14:28] <Monkeyweed21> Kojima made the game boring on purpose
[0:14:33] <%rumtumtugnutz> Poor elmo. All he wants is to sit by you and be a kitty and you're talking to us bunch of jackanapes
[0:14:36] <%Taglog7> I'm so high right now
[0:14:37] <%demegodz> Short? So Pat Sized?
[0:15:00] <%demegodz> Pat Falls Asleep on Stream
[0:15:00] <Alrewix> That voice though.
[0:15:10] <KaiserMario> @AngriestPat Don't worry about it, you did work already today, and everybody knows how tiresome talking to Woolie is... LUL
[0:15:12] <%rumtumtugnutz> ADOBOBOUROS?
[0:15:13] <%sporeian94> Fun fact Death Stranding is 0.1 points lower than Sonic Forces on IGN
[0:15:18] <+Sento_vidya> You ever feel like your head specifically wants to give up and die
[0:15:27] <%ssjklyco> It's not a Paige stream until things fall apart and break. It's not a Pat stream until you hear "I'm sleepy".
[0:15:32] <Calek> Death Stranding is just as good as Nintendogs according to Famitsu
[0:15:35] <%rumtumtugnutz> Now I wasnt to change my name to Abobobouros.
[0:15:37] <$RubberFistFight> @Sento_vidya I get migraines, so emphatically yes.
[0:15:44] <+griffball13> @AngriestPat how is paige's jet lag?
[0:15:45] <pillowwasp> Death stranding is also the 26th game ever to get a perfect score on Famitsu
[0:15:46] <%demegodz> @sporeian94 apatWhat apatWhat
[0:15:47] <Monkeyweed21> ok boomer
[0:15:48] <Jolnir> make sure to regularly poke your cat
[0:15:49] <TwinBat> try pills
[0:15:50] <%TIME_PUNCHER> Mine scream at me from down the hall
[0:15:54] <%marsanta> I wonder why redbull man
[0:15:54] <%ssjklyco> As he drinks the red bull
[0:15:54] <AMadHollow> I hate being poor, both because I want to play this game, and I want to steam this game
[0:15:56] <dekkitout> Sonic Forces scored better than Death Stranding? Man that's weird when taken out of context...
[0:15:56] <+Sento_vidya> Yeah I’m feeling that real hard right now
[0:15:58] <Alrewix> Only a little insomnia it's fine
[0:15:58] <%sporeian94> Death Stranding is just as good as Anthem and Crackdown 3 according to GB
[0:16:00] <KaiserMario> @AngriestPat He says as he chugs another REDBULL
[0:16:02] <jam526879> you say as you chug enery drink
[0:16:05] <cureneckbeard> ^
[0:16:05] <Monkeyweed21> Try weed for sleep
[0:16:06] <PirateMike_> Maybe it's the redbulls HMMMM
[0:16:07] <%rumtumtugnutz> Five pounds of what?
[0:16:11] <$RubberFistFight> @AngriestPat oh I see what you did there. Well played, sir.
[0:16:13] <+zabemareu> @rubberfistfight the part where said deal is an optional product that once it was gone should have been responded to with "Oh well i guess I'llgrab another food option." not "How dare you, people tryn to feed they children with this deal."
[0:16:18] <Calek> Jedi Fall Over
[0:16:20] <Zaphire_Saucypants> Same, Pat. Same
[0:16:22] <KeiPrime> there was some game that got the famitsu perfect score that made me not respect it anymore and i forgot what it was
[0:16:22] <Naoyin> jedi fallen over and he cant get up
[0:16:23] <%demegodz> One off
[0:16:25] <Cerabret100> @AngriestPat I've never been a good sleeper and working overnight makes it worse, I understand the struggle
[0:16:28] <cureneckbeard> five pounds is one bison dollar
[0:16:28] <%demegodz> Jedi Titan Fall
[0:16:33] <Nina96> that came out?
[0:16:33] <42nfl19> Apparently Jedi Fallen Order is a souls game?
[0:16:37] <dekkitout> jedi Fallen Over is a better name, I like that LUL
[0:16:38] <+griffball13> i am getting that game because Respawn
[0:16:43] <+CawfeeMike> CawfeeMike subscribed with Twitch Prime. 
[0:16:47] <AMadHollow> also, I've had weird sleep patterns to weeks as well. and my cat just said bwurrr
[0:16:47] <PirateMike_> Get some Indica you'll sleep like a baby
[0:16:55] <%King_Wolf_Rigger> I hope Jedi Fallen Order is good
[0:16:56] <%marsanta> It's great, best use of episodic content I've seen
[0:16:56] <%rumtumtugnutz> Jedi Falling Over is a souls game?
[0:17:00] <KeiPrime> oh right it was all star battle cause that game is not very good despite all the damn fanservice
[0:17:02] <Monkeyweed21> Hitman 2 is a VERY stream friendly game
[0:17:04] <%rumtumtugnutz> That might be kind of a no go for me
[0:17:11] <%SilvaChariot0133> pfffft
[0:17:12] <$RubberFistFight> @zabemareu so basically you think it's ok for a store to offer a special they know in advance they can't fulfil, in an area they know is highly populated and in which their product is popular, and customers should just STFU? OK, boomer.
[0:17:14] <Djinnazz> huh?

[0:33:04] <not_twitter_rowan> Go
[0:33:08] <Charuzu> he ate his own ass so...
[0:33:08] <KaiserMario> Patrick "punch-nuts" Boivin, nailed it
[0:33:10] <Edible_Enthusiasm> Give elmo Saltuna
[0:33:32] <not_twitter_rowan> my least favorite enemy to fight in this game are the mantises
[0:33:39] <scaryboisupreme> Acid tears them apart
[0:33:42] <%King_Wolf_Rigger> I love two-shotting bosses
[0:33:47] <Monkeyweed21> sell your junk boomer
[0:33:48] <+WutangchickeN> oh interesting I don't think I did this quest
[0:33:55] <+WutangchickeN> quest or task?
[0:33:57] <not_twitter_rowan> Neither did I
[0:34:04] <mrshazboto> I can't help but notice Pavaarti isn't in the party?
[0:34:04] <$RubberFistFight> @AngriestPat if his breath is that bad, you might want to look at getting him some dental snacks. They're hard and puffed up with little air bubbles, so he has to chew them hard, and they'll clean some of the crap off his teeth. He's what, 12? Getting to the point where he's much more liable for gum disease.
[0:34:18] <breakerdsx> Smellmo can't have dry/hard food
[0:34:31] <%King_Wolf_Rigger> Smellmo ONLY eats hard food
[0:34:34] <+WutangchickeN> @angriestpat ^^^^^ breath snackies
[0:34:35] <$RubberFistFight> You could always take him to the vet for a cleaning but in my experience they massively overcharge for what is basically a teeth-brushing.
[0:34:48] <not_twitter_rowan> YOU DID IT AGAIN
[0:34:48] <KaiserMario> @AngriestPat Double check your junk before selling, given your current state, you'll fuck up for sure
[0:34:53] <breakerdsx> Smellmo wants what he can't have
[0:34:55] <$Tarcanist_> you gonna eventually do a super nova playthrough down the line @angriestpat
[0:34:55] <+griffball13> @AngriestPat did you junk the helmet again?
[0:35:01] <scaryboisupreme> Pat you sold the unique helm again
[0:35:01] <Ran196> give elmo a bath
[0:35:08] <LandOfTheWay> SOLD IT AGAIN PAT

[0:36:24] <mayorrev> he jumpp
[0:36:28] <$RubberFistFight> @AngriestPat yeah my advice for stinky kitty mouth, given that he's a pretty chill cat, is dental snacks, a spray-based "teeth cleaner" (usually got like bicarb of soda and a cat-safe minty smell) and a soft toothbrush.
[0:36:34] <%AncelDeLambert> damn, gurl
[0:36:34] <+griffball13> pranked
[0:36:41] <%AncelDeLambert> shit, it his job, damn
[0:36:43] <%Svanyr> Better make sure the blinker fluid is full as well
[0:36:52] <dekkitout> That's like telling someone to get headlight fluid LUL

[0:37:24] <%King_Wolf_Rigger> @Svanyr Thanks for that reminder. Running low in truck, and I don't want to pull a BMW.
[0:37:25] <$RubberFistFight> You're welcome, I hope my advice doesn't break your stream again. Kappa ( :P )
[0:37:33] <PirateMike_> Hmmm

[0:37:55] <not_twitter_rowan> @AngriestPat How do you like Sanjar
[0:37:56] <%bettysharkface> He's kinda sweet
[0:37:57] <%AncelDeLambert> ... these horseradish and chive potato chips are not what I thought they'd be
[0:37:58] <dekkitout> One such monster she's interested in is the one between his legs Kappa
[0:38:00] <%Conyst> mostly the monster in your pants
[0:38:06] <scaryboisupreme> oh shit Pat found Euthanasia Kit, I just got it
[0:38:06] <+WutangchickeN> did pay find the guy bringing meds to people outside the wall???

[0:38:18] <$RubberFistFight> @AncelDeLambert are they good or bad?
[0:38:19] <not_twitter_rowan> Nice
[0:38:20] <Monkeyweed21> @WutangchickeN ye he killed them
[0:38:22] <KaiserMario> @AngriestPat Any idea where this game is going? Do you think you'll take down any corporation at all?
[0:38:25] <%AncelDeLambert> @RubberFistFight ... yes
[0:38:27] <breakerdsx> I like how you can't fast travel mid-jump
[0:38:29] <+WutangchickeN> yeyeye @monkeyweed21
[0:38:33] <scaryboisupreme> Euthanasia and Anti-Manti Ray are getting me through this whole damn planet
[0:38:36] <%King_Wolf_Rigger> @AncelDeLambert I have to know, what did you think they were gonna be?
[0:38:37] <not_twitter_rowan> most recent VoD isn't up yet @griffball13
[0:38:59] <%AncelDeLambert> @King_Wolf_Rigger kinda spicy, but maybe tart? I'unno I saw them and decided to try
[0:39:15] <Edible_Enthusiasm> that is alot of mantiqueens
[0:39:23] <%AncelDeLambert> I didn't expect the horseradish to chase the potato flavor as hard as it does
[0:39:23] <@Moobot> Hey, if you guys feel like checking out The Outer Worlds on account of this stream or cause you think I'm cool, go ahead and use this link https://bit.ly/2JmpB3Q to grab it off Greenman Gaming, and I'll get a few bucks kicked back. Thanks!
[0:39:24] <+griffball13> @not_twitter_rowan all good
[0:39:33] <not_twitter_rowan> the mantis are fucking bullshit on hardmode
[0:39:39] <$RubberFistFight> @AncelDeLambert if you can get past the weird hotness of it, horseradish actually has a rather pleasant flavour.
[0:39:54] <%King_Wolf_Rigger> @AncelDeLambert That's a bummer. I was thinking it would be like a hotter sour cream and onion
[0:39:59] <%AncelDeLambert> @RubberFistFight it's mostly the odd earthy flavor at the end that's hard to get past
[0:39:59] <KaiserMario> Nice hat boomer
[0:40:04] <$Mothman742> they arent tought pat cause ur in normal mode
[0:40:08] <%AncelDeLambert> @King_Wolf_Rigger me too
[0:40:30] <Edible_Enthusiasm> hes a shopkeeper... on the edge of a inpassable bridge
[0:40:33] <$RubberFistFight> @AncelDeLambert if you want another wierdly juxtaposed set of a flavours - try durian fruit. I had some for the first time recently and it's... uniwue.
[0:40:33] <+griffball13> metal slug voice- HEAVY MACHINE GUN
[0:40:37] <$RubberFistFight> unique*
[0:40:40] <%MightyMaxT> Ok Mooner
[0:40:41] <%dalmek> forget that, 46% discount
[0:41:01] <%AncelDeLambert> ew, god no, no way. I hear durian is only eaten because of the texture, the flavor is supposed to be as bad as the smell
[0:41:07] <%King_Wolf_Rigger> @AncelDeLambert Don't try durian fruit, @RubberFistFight has gone insane.
[0:41:27] <Edible_Enthusiasm> Starfruit is nice
[0:41:30] <scaryboisupreme> Man I'm loving the Sublight armor
[0:41:34] <KaiserMario> Is that 4034 ammo for a shotgun???
[0:41:36] <%AncelDeLambert> I'm starting to get past the horseradish flavor
[0:41:37] <not_twitter_rowan> Monarch is my favorite place
[0:41:42] <%King_Wolf_Rigger> Starfuit is nifty.
[0:41:50] <%CoreyOfMyLife> No Prob
[0:41:57] <+griffball13> is father max's quest here as well?
[0:41:57] <TheOriginOfAll> @AngriestPat I am your child please order me pizza

[0:42:13] <$RubberFistFight> @AncelDeLambert It smells atrocious, I won't deny that, but I think a lot of the strong reactions from people (that aren't just playing it up for youtube views) are just reactions to how unusual it tastes. It has compounds in it that are also found in onions, but the primary flavour is sort of lightly custardy.

[0:43:27] <$RubberFistFight> @AncelDeLambert at worst, you'll find it unpleasant. It won't ruin your day, make you curse the gods, cry, or destroy your mouth. It's just weird-tasting fruit.

[0:44:37] <$RubberFistFight> @King_Wolf_Rigger I'll be honest, even though it tastes weird as hell, I was kinda disappointed given how I've seen people act when they eat it. Kinda confirmed my suspicion that they're just overacting for the funnies.

[0:45:26] <scaryboisupreme> Pat is doing this so weird like this is the first thing I did and he seems pretty far in on Monarch

[0:46:59] <+griffball13> @BeefyQueefer he is
[0:46:59] <$RubberFistFight> @King_Wolf_Rigger you guessed wrong, sadly. My sense of smell is amazing. My GIRLFRIEND, on the other hand, I'm pretty sure her nose is just for show. But SHE absolutely reviles durian.

[0:47:30] <@lewdskeletor13> Arthur Morgan?
[0:47:36] <%King_Wolf_Rigger> @RubberFistFight but can you smell why kids love cinnamon toast crunch?
[0:48:02] <%AncelDeLambert> Cinnamon Toast Crunch is garbage, yeah I said it
[0:48:15] <42nfl19> So is French their version of Latin? a dead language?
[0:48:20] <$RubberFistFight> @King_Wolf_Rigger I'm going to assume they love it because children are psychopaths. Who the fuck puts cinnamon on toast.
[0:48:46] <%AncelDeLambert> CTC ruins the milk, it's undrinkable after eating the cereal
[0:48:48] <%CrabSlacks> I had cinnamon and butter toast as a kid
[0:49:00] <42nfl19> WTF how is the milf ruined after CTC?
[0:49:08] <42nfl19> milk
[0:49:10] <$RubberFistFight> @CrabSlacks I'm sorry you had such an abusive childhood Kappa
[0:49:11] <Edible_Enthusiasm> are those leve locks?

[0:49:18] <Edible_Enthusiasm> Level*
[0:49:25] <%King_Wolf_Rigger> @RubberFistFight OKay, I'll chalk it up to you being an alien from an upside down planet, but you make cinnamon-sugar, and put that on buttered toast. It's super good.
[0:49:35] <dekkitout> Is Ancel the type to think buttered rice is well spiced? Kappa
[0:49:36] <%lotharrio> Cinnamon toast is great.
[0:49:38] <KaiserMario> @AngriestPat Does Paige hate buying milk because she's scared of the bags?
[0:49:42] <42nfl19> wow I guess you boomers cant enjoy your sugary milk
[0:49:42] <Zaphire_Saucypants> cinnamon on toast is fuckin great. Specially when you put some powdered sugar on it and dip that shit in maple syrup.
[0:49:43] <$RubberFistFight> @King_Wolf_Rigger and you think I'M mad for liking durian.
[0:49:46] <%AncelDeLambert> bitch, send me your hottest curry
[0:50:01] <%CrabSlacks> cinnamon on french toast is also good

[0:50:53] <%AncelDeLambert> listen to Milhouse, Pat, shove your soul back in
[0:51:00] <Zaphire_Saucypants> @RubberFistFight I might be crazy, but that doesn't stop that shit from being delicious.
[0:51:03] <%AncelDeLambert> ewwww, fairy bread
[0:51:12] <%AncelDeLambert> dear god, I thought the world had gone mad when I saw that stuff
[0:51:19] <dekkitout> Is fairy bread bread with vegimite baked in?

[0:51:49] <Futurecity10> @AngriestPat Hey pat, off topic, but whats the best thing to run in pvp to get wolf tokens?
[0:51:53] <%ryome> Fairy bread is bread butter and sprinkles
[0:51:58] <%King_Wolf_Rigger> @dekkitout No, fairy bread is literally white bread with rainbow sprinkles. It's dumb and hilarious.
[0:52:01] <%AncelDeLambert> FUCKING SPRINKLES
[0:52:07] <$RubberFistFight> it's stupid as fuck
[0:52:08] <%scaryboisupreme> fuck i subscribed and the whole stream died on me
[0:52:13] <$RubberFistFight> I live here and I still don't get it
[0:52:18] <dekkitout> That sounds like it'd make for cute looking french toast...
[0:52:34] <%King_Wolf_Rigger> if it was buttered and fried sure
[0:52:39] <%AncelDeLambert> it does look cute, and then I remember how awful sprinkles are
[0:52:49] <%AncelDeLambert> mmm, sugar and food dye
[0:52:57] <Zaphire_Saucypants> mmmm fried bread....
[0:52:57] <$RubberFistFight> Nah it's just straight up garbage mass-produced white bread, cut into triangles, buttered and sprinkles on top.
[0:53:04] <%King_Wolf_Rigger> @RubberFistFight Have you had a cinnamon roll or french toast?
[0:53:06] <$RubberFistFight> It's low-effort from top to bottom.
[0:53:23] <%AncelDeLambert> let's all stop before we start salivating over funnel-cake
[0:53:25] <dekkitout> As low effort as a frito pie? I doubt it..

[0:53:49] <PirateMike_> Whats a funnel cake
[0:53:49] <%King_Wolf_Rigger> frito pie is more effort than oreo pie
[0:53:52] <%CrabSlacks> I wonder if you could market a milk flavored like it had cereal in it?
[0:53:53] <%honeyman18> I missed it all who has he killed?

[1:24:29] <Koosahmii> Buddhist if he becomes a philosophist, Taoist if he still worships the Board?

[1:24:47] <dekkitout> We going full Scanners?
[1:24:52] <xcompleasedad> Does he have any flaws?
[1:25:09] <$RubberFistFight> @lewdskeletor13 jesse custer still considers himself a preacher, so I guess.
[1:25:10] <Dozale> exploding heads? *mindblown*
[1:25:12] <themoistfart> @xcompleasedad he has to poop
[1:25:20] <%AncelDeLambert> wait, she's alive? I was sure it would turn out Max had shot her.
[1:25:22] <42nfl19> Wait did we turn Max into a Hippy?
[1:25:27] <dekkitout> The fuck kind of Intro to Philosophy statement...?
[1:25:27] <42nfl19> I can't tell
[1:25:28] <not_twitter_rowan> yes
[1:25:30] <+griffball13> what does max sound like now when you talk to him?

[1:25:34] <%Daniel_Is_I> Not a hippy, just made him not RAGE-FILLED
[1:25:34] <xcompleasedad> @themoistfart But did he get a perk from that?
[1:25:41] <VigilantShield> a violent hippy but yes a hippy
[1:25:41] <%AncelDeLambert> @Calek no, not even close
[1:25:44] <KaiserMario> Damn Hippies, with their sex and drugs
[1:25:57] <+griffball13> need zap
[1:25:58] <%AncelDeLambert> I'm amazed anyone is alive on this rock
[1:26:02] <42nfl19> Are there different outcomes to this quest? Like he get's a different personality to the one we just got?
[1:26:06] <Jolnir> @AngriestPat energy weapons work the best on bots
[1:26:07] <Graxe_> I thought robot weak points were the blue glowy bits?
[1:26:08] <@lewdskeletor13> Nah he’s just at peace with himself now. He’ll still shotgun a motherfucker
[1:26:17] <%MightyMaxT> Since Max is calm now, you gonna run the two redheads now?
[1:26:22] <%darcfowler1995> there is a blue core on all the robots that signifies their weak point
[1:26:26] <not_twitter_rowan> yes
[1:26:36] <%AncelDeLambert> there's a glowy thing on the robots?
[1:26:41] <@lewdskeletor13> @42nfl19 There are a few outcomes
[1:26:45] <+butterick> glowbots
[1:26:54] <%torontototoro> Besides Max + any crew member combo, Parvati + SAM is best imo
[1:26:55] <Zaphire_Saucypants> yeah...took me a while before I started getting different versions of that
[1:26:58] <%darcfowler1995> yeah all of the robots have a glow big robots on the legs small robot scores in the middle that rotates
[1:26:59] <+griffball13> @AngriestPat does max have anything to say now
[1:26:59] <Dakuu75> groundhog day

[1:27:14] <xcompleasedad> Like, she doesn't even shoot the gun.
[1:27:16] <dekkitout> It's probably the drugs still in your system...
[1:27:17] <@lewdskeletor13> They’re random so they do repeat
[1:27:19] <KaiserMario> @AngriestPat Do you still feel as strong about this game, as you did in he beginning?

[1:28:02] <%torontototoro> SAM is so simple and one-note. it's amazing
[1:28:07] <%foreverN2dust> For a robot he sure is low maintenance.
[1:28:15] <%King_Wolf_Rigger> SAM is super clean, so of course he's the perfect being
[1:28:16] <Monkeyweed21> never talked to Nyoka
[1:28:25] <+WutangchickeN> is Sam and max a reference to the lucasarts characters?
[1:28:28] <+griffball13> SAM will not rest until everthing is clean

[1:45:36] <%MightyMaxT> I did Ellie/Parvati
[1:45:36] <%AncelDeLambert> yeah, no you don't
[1:45:38] <%v1Ables> which is still not ok for vegans to eat
[1:45:44] <Dozale> you don't "gotta" anything
[1:45:45] <%SGrim> @King_Wolf_Rigger so I can legally fuck the Mantiqueen's spore holes? Hurray! Kreygasm
[1:45:45] <%Owkono> Owkono subscribed at Tier 1. They've subscribed for 17 months, currently on a 17 month streak! I thought there was someone sitting next to you, I think I'm tired
[1:45:47] <a_a_ronin> I brought Max
[1:46:02] <%AncelDeLambert> I brought Ellie and Parv, and the damn gas option was nowhere to be found
[1:46:03] <+Schlomogoldbergsteinowitz> Unless it's like wool, where *not* collecting it is detrimental
[1:46:04] <%foreverN2dust> @Owkono yeah, elmo is
[1:46:07] <%King_Wolf_Rigger> @SGrim Exactly! Now you're thinking with spore holes!
[1:46:12] <dekkitout> In this universe, I doubt even the produce is far from vegan friendly
[1:46:25] <DesuDesuDokiDoki> big lie
[1:46:25] <%SGrim> @King_Wolf_Rigger Spore Holes = More Holes! PogChamp
[1:46:39] <%honeyman18> Tumor Factory
[1:46:43] <$RubberFistFight> I don't think vegans would last very long in frontier space.
[1:46:44] <Monkeyweed21> Errors Unseen pat
[1:46:48] <%King_Wolf_Rigger> @SGrim I like me some more holes
[1:46:56] <%AncelDeLambert> oh so THAT'S what that region is for, I knew it had to be for something, I just don't have Nyoka
[1:47:07] <Dnarbredlih> Did Pat do the Parvati quest?
[1:47:09] <%starotter70> sipsipHellmo
[1:47:10] <+griffball13> no pat CLEAN them all
[1:47:20] <$RubberFistFight> CLEANSE THEM ALL
[1:47:39] <%SGrim> @King_Wolf_Rigger minimum is 7. One for every day of the week.
[1:47:40] <42nfl19> Will you aim to do all the companion sides quests before the main quest?
[1:47:43] <%King_Wolf_Rigger> Also, that agressive assumption that I'm a vegan. lol. hoo boy.
[1:47:49] <dekkitout> SAM, set cleaners to 'draconian'
[1:48:04] <%King_Wolf_Rigger> @SGrim At least. Variety is the spice of life.
[1:48:11] <MasterDecoder> What kind of dumb hat is that?
[1:48:48] <+griffball13> pat look out
[1:48:52] <Dakuu75> cat-like reflexes

[1:49:13] <breakerdsx> Welcome to Monarch
[1:49:19] <lol_red_ranger> can't spell boivin without bovine
[1:49:21] <lol_red_ranger> try it
[1:49:22] <%torontototoro> don't double back on mines, just sprint through. less or no damage that way
[1:49:27] <Ion_Laser> Wolverine-like reflexes
[1:49:38] <a_a_ronin> Wish I could give SAM a flamethrower
[1:50:13] <Futurecity10> @AngriestPat Cant save them, dont bother reloading
[1:50:14] <%GarbageNirvana> Does corrosive damage have any downsides?
[1:50:16] <Djinnazz> lol
[1:50:18] <%GarbageNirvana> Like, any at all?
[1:50:31] <%King_Wolf_Rigger> lol, ded
[1:50:31] <breakerdsx> RIP in pieces
[1:50:48] <%v1Ables> @AngriestPat Imma tell you straight up that the scientists dying is unnavoidable so you dont feel bad. I saved scummed it up cause I was so upset and redid this section WAY too many times
[1:51:14] <MistahMrMatt> the journal entry says something about it too
[1:51:14] <%Kirby_Sauce> cheer500 I can't wait to do my "just kill everyone. no, stop talking and die, why are you still talking *BLAM* *BLAM* *BLAM* no survivors" run of this game. also: terry looks sick guys.
[1:51:16] <dekkitout> Only downside I can imagine to corrosive is the fallout from facing an enemy made entirely made of magnesium, potassium, or calcium...
[1:51:53] <%King_Wolf_Rigger> I like how SAM calls people dirt. It tickles me.

[1:52:38] <MistahMrMatt> ^
[1:52:51] <%AncelDeLambert> NV is superiour
[1:52:55] <dekkitout> You're less likely to fall through the terrain in this game than in NV
[1:52:57] <%honeyman18> RIZZO'S CANDY AND BOOZE
[1:53:05] <%scaryboisupreme> I don't think NV and this game really compare, they're both great games
[1:53:06] <%AncelDeLambert> I in fact would also claim that KOTOR2 is superior

[1:53:45] <mudkipz_v2> gonna get it during a black friday sale just cause obsidian is great
[1:54:08] <%King_Wolf_Rigger> @AncelDeLambert Now, I would say that both of those games are great, but don't you think you're going a little overboard saying OW isn't as good a either one of those?

[2:15:24] <dekkitout> Gallivanting around the Galaxy would be a better way to put it
[2:15:27] <%A_German_spy> @AngriestPat I think it's the first game in as far back as I can remember that hasn't disappointed me in any meaningful way. It's fantastic.
[2:15:28] <%AncelDeLambert> it's good but flawed
[2:15:53] <Dakuu75> "can't put a moon helmet on Sam" 1-star game
[2:15:54] <%AncelDeLambert> weapon system aint great
[2:15:58] <%A_German_spy> @AngriestPat The writing is aces. My only real complaint is the text size and some smaller system-related issues.
[2:16:05] <%lotharrio> I'd say it's at least a B+, which is pretty good compared to a number of games I ran into the last few months.
[2:16:21] <%AncelDeLambert> @lotharrio I'll agree with that
[2:16:25] <Djinnazz> XD
[2:16:26] <%A_German_spy> @AngriestPat Totally fair on those criticisms.
[2:16:31] <KeiPrime> LIE
[2:16:33] <Ion_Laser> lol
[2:16:35] <%scaryboisupreme> The only problem i have with this game is none of the armors jive with me. Nothing really stands out, like there's no NCR Ranger armor equivalent in this

[2:16:43] <DesuDesuDokiDoki> lie
[2:16:43] <Djinnazz> KEEP THE DRUGS
[2:16:43] <%AncelDeLambert> no he can't
[2:16:43] <%lotharrio> DLC and patches might push it into the A range.

[2:17:12] <@lewdskeletor13> PUNCH HIM
[2:17:13] <%GarbageNirvana> The only real gripe I have is that I wish the game were just a bit more substantial
[2:17:20] <RagingLeo> that is incredible. I never thought I'd see a choice like that. LUL
[2:17:22] <DesuDesuDokiDoki> punch again!

[2:18:05] <DesuDesuDokiDoki> its fine~
[2:18:14] <+fugatlas> I did a 2 handed melee build, and i didn't at all feel like it turned into a cake walk near the end

[2:18:33] <Djinnazz> hit'm
[2:18:33] <%A_German_spy> @AngriestPat Hah, yeah, I ran into that myself. My min-maxing habit broke the latter half of the game... which was fine, for the precise reasons you just explained.
[2:18:34] <%AncelDeLambert> you can feel it's on a budget, you can feel it's brand new IP that they're feeling around in the dark for

[2:22:09] <%Kirby_Sauce> WINK
[2:22:09] <%GarbageNirvana> I will say this, you should probably let it sit and stew for a little while before you go in on a second playthrough
[2:22:10] <%TheTakkster> I just wish it was bigger
[2:22:10] <$DeeJayOkay> PUNCH HIM
[2:22:16] <%SergeEXE> SergeEXE subscribed at Tier 1. They've subscribed for 23 months! Almost 2 stream babby
[2:22:21] <+shaderichter_belmont> of course he says wink
[2:22:23] <+drawdehellfire> @lewdskeletor13 That's how your family feels about you
[2:22:24] <PipingHotBeepis> wink *keeps eyes completely open the entire time*
[2:22:24] <%honeyman18> well I remember the story with him being interviewed after, but there certainly was a man eaten alive by rats as well somewhere
[2:22:26] <KitsuneManami> You have one more "City" before the end of the game. so dont rush hehe
[2:22:31] <%GarbageNirvana> otherwise it's going to feel all samey
[2:22:36] <TheHeroAppears> wink'
[2:22:38] <RagingLeo> they couldn't just animated him winking. they make him SAY IT. please hit him again

[2:23:04] <%Totally_not_toby> this dude is great and also sounds like dick masterson
[2:23:09] <+griffball13> welp he dead
[2:23:10] <LandOfTheWay> SNITCH
[2:23:14] <KitsuneManami> the "Writing" and Voice Acting make up for a LOT of this games faults.
[2:23:17] <Futurecity10> Close the door, crouch, then put a bullet in his skull
[2:23:21] <DesuDesuDokiDoki> F
[2:23:29] <%miguelrod777> fuck you pat let him keep his rats
[2:23:42] <%King_Wolf_Rigger> @honeyman18 death or near death by rat-consumption is pretty high up there in my list of "Do not want"
[2:23:44] <%Kirby_Sauce> he will keep his rats
[2:23:47] <%Kirby_Sauce> IN HELL
[2:23:53] <RagingLeo> @KitsuneManami making him say it makes him that much more punchable so it's better
[2:24:20] <KeiPrime> obsidian REALLY proud of that smirk animation aint they
[2:24:32] <KitsuneManami> @KeiPrime Yes they are
[2:24:36] <%King_Wolf_Rigger> It's a good smirk
[2:24:48] <KitsuneManami> Easier to reuse it when everyone looks the same
[2:24:48] <@Moobot> Hey, if you guys feel like checking out The Outer Worlds on account of this stream or cause you think I'm cool, go ahead and use this link https://bit.ly/2JmpB3Q to grab it off Greenman Gaming, and I'll get a few bucks kicked back. Thanks!
[2:25:30] <%Kirby_Sauce> put points into forward air dash
[2:25:30] <%King_Wolf_Rigger> All people look the same in real life too. Just ugly little fuckers breathing my air.
[2:25:41] <%honeyman18> Okay finally got it, it was Glen from Hoarders and the episode he slept in chairs to save his hair and eye juice. He had 1000s of rats.
[2:25:44] <Seraphile> just tuning in, how is the "fuck graham" gang going
[2:25:50] <%A_German_spy> @AngriestPat Which bandits?
[2:25:55] <Monkeyweed21> Outer Worlds is a cute little lamb but I feel like Disco Elysium is an even cuter littler lamb I care about more @AngriestPat
[2:25:59] <%lotharrio> Good work, SAM.
[2:26:08] <%King_Wolf_Rigger> @honeyman18 Great, now I'll never watch that show lol.
[2:26:09] <Seraphile> SAM+Nyoka? best combo
[2:26:12] <%TheTakkster> Oh that's just a shitty bandit camp
[2:26:16] <%lotharrio> If they're marauders, then just murder them.
[2:26:17] <DesuDesuDokiDoki> gloop <3
[2:26:19] <KitsuneManami> @AngriestPat When the game tells you "Make sure you do everything before this" It MEANS it, do every quest before you do it because theres no after credits.
[2:26:21] <%TheTakkster> No consequence
[2:26:30] <dekkitout> So ghoul farming for karma?
[2:26:33] <Seraphile> they have a shopkeeper hostage irrc
[2:26:35] <%A_German_spy> @AngriestPat Oh, no, killing those bandits has no impact, positive or negative. Other than that you get to loot them.
[2:26:36] <KitsuneManami> lol that was funny
[2:26:38] <Seraphile> did you rescue her?
[2:27:02] <%A_German_spy> @AngriestPat Sure thing spyAce
[2:27:03] <implied_consent> @a_german_spy Alternative for Deutchland
[2:27:19] <%squidking96> hi spy

[2:27:55] <%squidking96> im painting a tentacle bug monster for warhammer 40k
[2:27:56] <Seraphile> im sad you can't get a pet canid in this game
[2:27:57] <%GarbageNirvana> She's just really enthusiastic
[2:28:00] <%marsanta> It's how she expresses herself
[2:28:00] <%TheTakkster> The goop gun is far and away the best science weapon
[2:28:07] <KitsuneManami> @AngriestPat Have you nto played Borderlands 2 or 3? your character SCREAMS when they have a debuff and they scream LOUD
[2:28:08] <dekkitout> She loves her some rampaging
[2:28:09] <%Totally_not_toby> she's got plenty of reason, she's having a good time!
[2:28:13] <Seraphile> @squidking96 nids?
[2:28:20] <%squidking96> yes
[2:28:25] <%King_Wolf_Rigger> @squidking96 nids are cool
[2:28:26] <Seraphile> nice
[2:28:36] <Seraphile> my bf has imperials & orcs
[2:28:40] <%honeyman18> Is Nyoka the most unstable of the crew?
[2:28:48] <%squidking96> and from what i heard they're next for psychic awakening
[2:28:57] <Dakuu75> "I through dead things into a river." #SimplePleasures
[2:28:58] <%King_Wolf_Rigger> I play Space Wolves, go figure lol
[2:29:03] <Paradocks23> @king_wolf_rigger Ah, you like bugs.
[2:29:25] <%King_Wolf_Rigger> @Paradocks23 They have a cool army list, I can't lie about that.
[2:29:26] <%squidking96> turning this into a warhammer chat
[2:29:30] <Paradocks23> Nids are... Bleh.
[2:29:35] <Monkeyweed21> talk to nyoka
[2:29:40] <Seraphile> isnt that how warhammer normally goes
[2:29:55] <%A_German_spy> @AngriestPat A word of warning about this and the next Sublight quest, in case nobody's advised you yet. If you complete them now, there's a chance (depending on your rep with the Board) that everyone in a later area will be hostile as soon as you walk in, which might screw you out of some quests there.
[2:29:56] <Seraphile> tho my my bf has been really into AoS lately
[2:29:57] <DesuDesuDokiDoki> ver fast chat
[2:30:04] <%solidousstream> I'm fading night guys!
[2:30:04] <dekkitout> I wish I had even a micron of an understanding about WH
[2:30:13] <%roundaboutrevengeance> "chat"
[2:30:14] <Monkeyweed21> buy ID in Fallbrook
[2:30:14] <%King_Wolf_Rigger> the grim dark future is nothing but warhammer chat.
[2:30:18] <Seraphile> he got given a box of goblins for his birthday and it was gateway drug (to plastic crack)
[2:30:31] <@lewdskeletor13> You never bought the id
[2:30:33] <dekkitout> All I know is something something party god Salanesh
[2:30:40] <%squidking96> i play ironjawz in AoS
[2:30:47] <%squidking96> theyre fun
[2:30:54] <Seraphile> :0
[2:31:01] <$supersmolman> does anybody know if Pat's found the tiny hat yet
[2:31:13] <%King_Wolf_Rigger> @dekkitout The Emperor himself hated being thought of as a god, and he was awake in the 41st millenium, he'd kill most of the people who worship him. Now you know something nifty.
[2:31:17] <DesuDesuDokiDoki> FLEX
[2:31:20] <Seraphile> are ironjaws the ones with worgs
[2:31:25] <%King_Wolf_Rigger> *if he was awake
[2:31:46] <Seraphile> my favourite 40k meme is "magnus did nothing wrong"
[2:32:03] <%King_Wolf_Rigger> LOL He did all the things wrong.
[2:32:12] <Prism_Wing> Is this guy Pat's evil twin?
[2:32:13] <Seraphile> he tried his best
[2:32:21] <Charuzu> my body is
[2:32:22] <KitsuneManami> @AngriestPat Everyone in this game is stupid
[2:32:29] <Djinnazz> Yup
[2:32:30] <investorscratchit> whens paige
[2:32:33] <%King_Wolf_Rigger> I suppose he did. Then he gave himself to Tzeentch.
[2:32:41] <dekkitout> That's a pretty sweet looking helmet
[2:33:01] <BlacSoul> i like that one
[2:33:09] <%conradical> i don't like these stealth sections
[2:33:20] <%GarbageNirvana> Just about everyone in this game has been systematically educated by the Board to be stupid
[2:33:23] <%honeyman18> apatCrazyhand apatCrazyhead
[2:33:24] <KitsuneManami> @dekkitout glad you like it, its one of the 3 helm models that arent butt weak
[2:33:25] <%AncelDeLambert> wait, you can talk to them? I saw the no entry sign and just used the waterfall
[2:33:35] <Seraphile> i finished this area too quickly and didn't get ~lore~
[2:33:37] <Seraphile> regret
[2:33:47] <KitsuneManami> @Seraphile you didnt miss much
[2:33:50] <Seraphile> used waterfall too
[2:33:56] <%AncelDeLambert> like, they wouldn't talk to me over the fence, so I just snuck in
[2:34:04] <Seraphile> ok but I wanted to meet "the king"
[2:34:06] <Paradocks23> @dekkitout Everything sucks, flamethrower soldier nuns, big ballerina tank men that aren't really human. Bunch of different gods that are basically violence, indulgence, disease and WAAAAGH
[2:34:16] <theshadowproducer> did pat or wollie say what happened to the pdcast this week
[2:34:24] <%Kirby_Sauce> yummy yummy tumors
[2:34:32] <%Kirby_Sauce> wollie
[2:34:34] <42nfl19> podcast was today
[2:34:37] <Seraphile> cystipigs are much less cruel
[2:34:38] <Paradocks23> Delicious tumor meat.
[2:34:41] <Prism_Wing> @theshadowproducer It was today LUL
[2:35:07] <Djinnazz> shit.
[2:35:11] <dekkitout> Flamethrower soldier nuns sounds like my kind of thing, indulge me further
[2:35:14] <Ion_Laser> well shit...
[2:35:18] <Scatter0> Sup, pat. what do you think about outer worlds?
[2:35:25] <theshadowproducer> huh I didnt see the file up on the sauperbeast website so I didnt know if it happened
[2:35:29] <%logoth_> These robots are poorly made
[2:35:33] <Djinnazz> Stupid machines
[2:35:44] <theshadowproducer> I'll f 5 till she shows up for my alaskan ass
[2:35:50] <%Kirby_Sauce> it's better than them just exploding
[2:35:55] <allanmiri> Not really, I shot the place up last time.
[2:36:02] <Paradocks23> Not if you're a two handed melee character in heavy armor.
[2:36:14] <Paradocks23> I just hammered my way through.
[2:36:19] <BlacSoul> probably why its so easy to walk past these IDIOTS
[2:36:21] <%honeyman18> disguise recharges if you pop in and out of the Restricted Zone
[2:36:28] <Djinnazz> @Paradocks23 Hammer Brother!
[2:36:59] <%arancet> oh he looks normal
[2:37:05] <+griffball13> VAMPIRE
[2:37:05] <%lotharrio> Wow got to this guy so much faster than I did.

[2:37:17] <%AncelDeLambert> you've got red on you
[2:37:21] <%DrFacilier> this guy seems a little..shady...around the eyes...
[2:37:24] <%honeyman18> He's like a sith
[2:37:29] <%Totally_not_toby> this dudes VERY nuts
[2:37:31] <KitsuneManami> Remember, Outer Worlds, men are either dumb or evil
[2:37:31] <RagingLeo> he's like a lizard man
[2:37:37] <%GarbageNirvana> This guy's a fucking cartoon, Jesus Christ
[2:37:42] <%AncelDeLambert> okay, he's wierd, off him
[2:37:52] <allanmiri> This guy would fit right in with the Texas Chainsaw Massacre family.
[2:37:54] <dekkitout> Imbibe- I don't like that word...
[2:37:54] <%King_Wolf_Rigger> This guy's already great.
[2:37:55] <@lewdskeletor13> @kitsunemanami What?
[2:38:00] <%AbnormalVoid> monkaS
[2:38:00] <BlacSoul> Whats with all of the fucking cannibals
[2:38:10] <RagingLeo> I would love for some sort of writer have a guy like him be a protag
[2:38:13] <eanscrale> Seems trustworthy!
[2:38:16] <%SGrim> Oh hey look, it's Pat.
[2:38:17] <%AncelDeLambert> Sanjar is neither, Sanjar is gud boi
[2:38:19] <+griffball13> he talks like the warden form house of the dead overkill
[2:38:22] <Paradocks23> @djinnazz Plasma pulse hammer was beautiful. Took me to end game.
[2:38:41] <+thewaifoo> thats a nice rug pat has
[2:38:45] <%AncelDeLambert> and I wouldn't call Max dumb nor evil, just an asshat
[2:38:48] <$RubberFistFight> jesus who's this horrifying-looking asshole
[2:38:52] <Prism_Wing> Kappa
[2:39:03] <%arancet> yeah, this is shaved sith pat
[2:39:05] <%AncelDeLambert> @RubberFistFight apparently he's the Monarch pig farmer
[2:39:05] <DesuDesuDokiDoki> a whole lifetime?
[2:39:08] <%GarbageNirvana> This is a Frank Miller character
[2:39:08] <allanmiri> This guy seems reasonable.
[2:39:12] <dekkitout> Nah uh uh, you fence sitter Kappa
[2:39:29] <Prism_Wing> @rubberfistfight That's just the Steve Buschemi frame. looking more gross than usual.
[2:39:35] <Kaitepaints> Boarst sounds like a word the Swedish chef would say
[2:39:36] <Seraphile> he wants to be the monarch of monarch
[2:39:50] <$RubberFistFight> @Prism_Wing LUL
[2:39:50] <@Moobot> Hey, if you guys feel like checking out The Outer Worlds on account of this stream or cause you think I'm cool, go ahead and use this link https://bit.ly/2JmpB3Q to grab it off Greenman Gaming, and I'll get a few bucks kicked back. Thanks!
[2:39:51] <allanmiri> I say shoot him now!
[2:39:55] <%AncelDeLambert> man he's fecking weird
[2:40:26] <Kaitepaints> Boarst moarst lorthes
[2:40:38] <Seraphile> how dare he call catherine a sow
[2:40:44] <Seraphile> shes the 2nd best
[2:40:55] <Djinnazz> I don't wanna know what that means
[2:40:55] <Seraphile> to zora
[2:40:56] <+remagoediv> Helping the cannibals
[2:40:56] <%AncelDeLambert> Don't play none of that book shite, don't touch me coppah!
[2:40:59] <%lotharrio> I worked out a peace between them, and then shrugged and murdered him anyway.
[2:41:07] <%lotharrio> He was too unsettling.
[2:41:09] <%King_Wolf_Rigger> Anyone calling anyone a sow, reminds me of Hellsing.
[2:41:13] <%Kirby_Sauce> 1
[2:41:16] <Hidashi13> hey pat how've been sir
[2:41:17] <dekkitout> I'm imagining this guy drawn by John Romita Jr, and yeah he's totally a Frank Miller character
[2:41:19] <$RubberFistFight> 1, lol
[2:41:25] <%AncelDeLambert> I just poisoned the pigs, didn't want to go past the bots
[2:41:29] <%roundaboutrevengeance> You teamed up with the cannibal! ....... Wait what
[2:41:31] <%King_Wolf_Rigger> @Djinnazz Sow means a female pig.
[2:41:31] <%logoth_> Augh! My knees!
[2:41:36] <%AncelDeLambert> look at all the SHIT
[2:41:37] <Seraphile> I just hacked the bank accounts
[2:41:38] <%honeyman18> Honestly the ONLY reason to eat tumors was to be humane, fuck this shit.
[2:41:39] <Prism_Wing> same
[2:41:39] <Seraphile> negative money
[2:41:41] <%AncelDeLambert> POOLS of it!
[2:41:42] <%arancet> @AngriestPat why do you keep breaking your legs? trying to make them shorter?
[2:41:44] <Cozy90> POOP
[2:41:50] <%lotharrio> Oh he's not a cannibal @roundaboutrevengeance he's just feeding people to his pigs.
[2:41:58] <Seraphile> @honeyman18 but they are bacon favoured
[2:42:17] <$RubberFistFight> corporate trooper? Don't you mean corporate POOPER? Hahahah... I'll be quiet now.
[2:42:19] <%Kirby_Sauce> keep in mind how FAST pigs breed, cystypigs are super efficient
[2:42:23] <Djinnazz> @King_Wolf_Rigger I I know that, I meant the short curlies part.
[2:42:23] <Prism_Wing> I also lost Kreygasm
[2:42:31] <%roundaboutrevengeance> @lotharrio I tasted the beans he has in the back and he had a very different response
[2:42:32] <%AncelDeLambert> @AngriestPat how long do you plan to go for tonight?
[2:42:41] <%Kirby_Sauce> ther's a reason they call it "porking"
[2:42:43] <%King_Wolf_Rigger> @Djinnazz Ah yes, that refers to pubic hair.
[2:43:10] <@lewdskeletor13> You can never spoil da Elmo enough
[2:43:14] <Hidashi13> didnt know pat would team up with bricktop
[2:43:30] <%roundaboutrevengeance> @lotharrio not joking by the way, don't eat the beans
[2:43:33] <dekkitout> Cannibals do make for excellent cleaners
[2:43:34] <$RubberFistFight> bet Woolie loves this game with all the short haired girls in it
[2:43:48] <deviljhojho_> easy money
[2:43:51] <$supersmolman> @honeyman18 not to mention efficient you only have to collect the tumor instead of killing the whole pig
[2:44:19] <%Piemen99> boooooo
[2:44:25] <deviljhojho_> Damn i didnt know you could do this
[2:44:26] <Dakuu75> cannibal flavored peace
[2:44:28] <%King_Wolf_Rigger> Peaceful solutions are for cowards
[2:44:32] <%Black_Machete> you missed your free room
[2:44:37] <deviljhojho_> I always just go for the hack and complete the quest in like 3 minutes
[2:44:41] <%honeyman18> Well you really killed like a hundred doods down the line though.
[2:44:45] <+Kurvera> not solving problems by killing everyone Pat is weak PepeHands
[2:45:11] <+drawdehellfire> Pat pats pets

[2:45:30] <deviljhojho_> Nyoka Cola
[2:45:47] <allanmiri> Go get em SAM
[2:45:49] <+TOONFOOD> Set Nyoka to ranged for maximum science
[2:45:54] <CrypticMochi> I wonder if those pigs have a negative long term effect as a staple food
[2:46:09] <%King_Wolf_Rigger> Fuck she's radical
[2:46:10] <deviljhojho_> im sure they love being eaten perpetually
[2:46:24] <Seraphile> the pigs are less of a staple than saltuna
[2:46:32] <%Kirby_Sauce> she's basically Noel Vermilion
[2:47:05] <+drawdehellfire> Nyoka can't chew her stitches in that outfit
[2:47:13] <Prism_Wing> Here's a woman with long hair right here.
[2:48:01] <+griffball13> PTSD is a bitch
[2:49:18] <DesuDesuDokiDoki> pff
[2:49:18] <%AbnormalVoid> AAAAAAAAHHHHHHHHHHHH
[2:49:22] <%AncelDeLambert> ... damn girl, chill

[2:51:22] <@lewdskeletor13> cryShrug

[2:53:01] <mrshazboto> Again - are you not planning on using ANY of the Science Weapons? Because maxing science is real strong.
[2:53:07] <%King_Wolf_Rigger> Hack the planet!
[2:53:11] <+griffball13> zombos
[2:53:21] <+griffball13> itchy tasty
[2:53:28] <Seraphile> @King_Wolf_Rigger ***
[2:54:00] <%honeyman18> Monsters are made by men I guess, but it's not actually clear.
[2:54:02] <%King_Wolf_Rigger> What three word could be asterisked in such a way?
[2:54:56] <%King_Wolf_Rigger> three lettered word* christ, it's not English is my native language or anything
[2:54:56] <@Moobot> Hey, if you guys feel like checking out The Outer Worlds on account of this stream or cause you think I'm cool, go ahead and use this link https://bit.ly/2JmpB3Q to grab it off Greenman Gaming, and I'll get a few bucks kicked back. Thanks!
[2:55:14] <Seraphile> btw can I say I love how the sublight questline ends
[2:55:41] <DesuDesuDokiDoki> ?
[2:55:49] <%Black_Machete> I want to believe
[2:55:51] <%King_Wolf_Rigger> Can you?
[2:55:58] <$supersmolman> the worst it's ever been
[2:56:02] <allanmiri> Aliens
[2:56:10] <%Black_Machete> PC pat
[2:56:30] <%RiceeFTW> noonSure noonSure noonSure noonSure
[2:56:33] <based_versauen> The ending to the sublight questline baffled me lol i was not expecting that from the sublight lady. Whatever her name is, I forget.
[2:56:37] <Seraphile> with lilya
[2:57:00] <Seraphile> what I love is there is no option to convince her
[2:57:03] <+griffball13> umbrella labs here we go
[2:57:15] <Seraphile> like you have a 100 persuade check to get more money out of her
[2:57:20] <Seraphile> but thats it
[2:57:27] <mankeyfigh> BUSTAH WOLF
[2:57:27] <$supersmolman> @based_versauen i oinked at her
[2:57:28] <Seraphile> you cannot change her convictions
[2:57:56] <Seraphile> <BEEP> <BOOP>
[2:58:05] <@lewdskeletor13> Ludwig was right
[2:58:15] <%King_Wolf_Rigger> I like characters with strong convictions. Never made sense to me that you could talk to someone for ten seconds and they would change everything about themselves.
[2:58:16] <@lewdskeletor13> MrDestructoid MrDestructoid MrDestructoid
[2:58:17] <Seraphile> thats an achievment
[2:58:24] <Seraphile> "Ludwig was right"
[2:58:29] <@lewdskeletor13> Oh I know
[2:58:30] <based_versauen> We are made men by the blood
[2:58:34] <+drawdehellfire> Armor is pointless for anything but fashion
[2:58:34] <+TOONFOOD> the sublight helmet looks awesome
[2:58:59] <based_versauen> We are undone by the blood
[2:59:00] <Seraphile> @King_Wolf_Rigger same, thats why I love tyranny a lot
[2:59:15] <%King_Wolf_Rigger> I've been looking at getting Tyranny
[2:59:19] <@lewdskeletor13> The only trophy I still need for this game is the Supernova one
[2:59:22] <based_versauen> Fear the Old Blood
[2:59:27] <+griffball13> SAM MVP
[2:59:28] <%lotharrio> Good work, SAM!
[2:59:31] <%AbnormalVoid> LUL
[2:59:33] <VigilantShield> robot for the win
[2:59:35] <%GarbageNirvana> yoooo
[2:59:37] <allanmiri> GOod Job SAM
[2:59:38] <%King_Wolf_Rigger> SAM a boss
[2:59:38] <Seraphile> Bless SAM
[2:59:39] <Djinnazz> Nice work Sam!
[2:59:48] <@lewdskeletor13> MrDestructoid hello fellow Robot MrDestructoid
[2:59:49] <seycheles> big patters!
[2:59:51] <dekkitout> Executive cleaning order
[2:59:54] <%bread_assassin> I didn't know about that.
[3:00:00] <TechDragon_Z> Pat watchout, SAM is awesome.
[3:00:07] <+Elky3> did the Destiny craze die down for you or do you still enjoy it off stream every now and again? @angriestpat bingHmm
[3:00:14] <seycheles> home from the gym time for some pat action
[3:00:21] <Seraphile> i forgot how rizzo rate things in flavours/colours
[3:00:31] <%King_Wolf_Rigger> PETRIFYING PURPLEBERRY! God I love the script in this game
[3:00:47] <Glass_Muffin> @angriestpat favorite companions?
[3:00:49] <+drawdehellfire> Ada, boost the 3d3d3
[3:01:01] <Seraphile> im willing to bet his fave is Max
[3:01:03] <based_versauen> I tried to get back into Destiny then remembered it's a grindfest and immediately fell right off of it
[3:01:13] <@lewdskeletor13> Hmmmm
[3:01:17] <CursedNobleman> I AM THE LAW LUL
[3:01:19] <based_versauen> grinding kills my souls
[3:01:27] <@lewdskeletor13> cryMonka
[3:01:34] <based_versauen> Soul*
[3:01:47] <%WackyGear> what that mean?
[3:01:48] <Charuzu> why is that significant?
[3:01:50] <dekkitout> Space-FDA approved, just like I said
[3:01:52] <%King_Wolf_Rigger> that means it's fine
[3:01:56] <%lotharrio> So they could fiddle with the terraformers and kill all the mantisaurs and raptidons on the planet, if they wanted to.
[3:01:57] <Monkeyweed21> they only live cause the terraforming was done bad
[3:02:11] <DesuDesuDokiDoki> save lives? no thanks bruh
[3:02:15] <+griffball13> and then sanjan would be the boss
[3:02:19] <Seraphile> every hostile macrofauna
[3:02:20] <%AbnormalVoid> I wouldn't go that far lol
[3:02:33] <mrshazboto> Wouldn't...wouldn't that cause irreparable brain damage to the populace?
[3:02:34] <Charuzu> that's hilariously awful
[3:02:34] <%AncelDeLambert> can't wait until he finds the memorial
[3:02:35] <%XeroSigmaPrime> But then you COMPLETELY fuck over the existing ecosystem
[3:02:37] <CursedNobleman> i didnt actually read these consoles. hell, i never do. i read the wikidumps LUL
[3:02:37] <@lewdskeletor13> But that costs money tho
[3:02:46] <dekkitout> That's basically how dinosaurs worked, big oxygen = big kaiju
[3:02:48] <%AncelDeLambert> doing things right costs money, Pat, gawd
[3:02:53] <$SpecterHDMC> so typical human fuck up then
[3:02:57] <%lotharrio> Yeah but the existing ecosystem is inherently hostile to human life so...
[3:03:00] <%marsanta> The map here is bugged
[3:03:09] <%AncelDeLambert> hello money
[3:03:18] <Seraphile> iirc that helmet is gucci
[3:03:23] <%GarbageNirvana> Colonialism at its finest
[3:03:27] <%AncelDeLambert> anyone actually gotten past the steam?
[3:03:34] <$SpecterHDMC> tea
[3:03:35] <Seraphile> i did
[3:03:36] <$SpecterHDMC> yea
[3:03:42] <DesuDesuDokiDoki> LUL
[3:03:44] <+drawdehellfire> Landmines? More like landOURS haha
[3:03:46] <CursedNobleman> wait, what % O2 content did they specify, people have problems below 19.5
[3:03:53] <@lewdskeletor13> You gotta ensure your SAM
[3:03:57] <$SpecterHDMC> gotts crouch and be metal gear like
[3:04:04] <Monkeyweed21> the landmines were their children
[3:04:26] <Seraphile> i love that the rizzo drones are bright pink
[3:04:28] <%AncelDeLambert> so do you have to open the door, or...?
[3:04:32] <$SpecterHDMC> Pat Be Big Boss in this situation
[3:04:34] <SaltyDavid> You can kinda travel through that steam
[3:04:39] <%AncelDeLambert> oh, huh
[3:04:44] <+drawdehellfire> The Epic Store told Obsidian to put that hallway in to show how Steam is bad
[3:04:44] <Seraphile> the steam is manageable
[3:04:47] <%AncelDeLambert> is there anything back there?
[3:05:00] <SaltyDavid> You can do something really cool if you go through the steam
[3:05:21] <Charuzu> will video games ever find a solution to fucking companions getting in your line of sight?
[3:05:24] <%XeroSigmaPrime> If you were to alter O2 levels enough to kill any predators, it would be enough to also destroy primary producers (plants) which convert energy to actual useful form for everything
[3:05:36] <%Black_Machete> too late he did it himself
[3:05:48] <CursedNobleman> @XeroSigmaPrime plants process CO2?
[3:05:52] <DesuDesuDokiDoki> she big cumm
[3:05:54] <%AncelDeLambert> ME2 kept your friends out of your shit. Most of the time.
[3:06:06] <%AncelDeLambert> god this is raw as hell, this room
[3:06:16] <Seraphile> plants are surprisingly adaptive when it comes to respiration
[3:06:19] <+drawdehellfire> @AngriestPat Just put your lips on the Mantisaurs and suck out all the oxygen so they die faster
[3:06:20] <Seraphile> unlike animals
[3:06:24] <SaltyDavid> Behind the steam is an easier way to kill the mantisaurs but you can just shoot them too I guess
[3:06:44] <@lewdskeletor13> cryMonka cryMonka cryMonka
[3:07:12] <CursedNobleman> im giving up on trying to play 3DS MGS3 for now, playing ocarina
[3:07:20] <%AncelDeLambert> Pat has, uh, skipped some logs
[3:07:35] <Seraphile> ~L O R E~
[3:07:38] <Charuzu> sounds like it lol
[3:07:41] <%honeyman18> EVIL BEGINS
[3:07:49] <%AncelDeLambert> you rushed through two rooms, dude
[3:08:04] <DesuDesuDokiDoki> missed some pcs
[3:08:09] <%Black_Machete> missed a room in steam hall
[3:08:19] <%AncelDeLambert> fucking SHRINE
[3:08:30] <%AncelDeLambert> I noticed him AFTER reading the papers
[3:08:39] <%AncelDeLambert> it was... shocking
[3:08:43] <%Dylveryn> Read the papers by the tube
[3:08:46] <Seraphile> if you continue to quest line it will be explained
[3:08:55] <@lewdskeletor13> Some shit was going on
[3:09:02] <%RiceeFTW> chimerist hggShook
[3:09:38] <SaltyDavid> Depends on what they were experimenting with
[3:09:39] <%XeroSigmaPrime> @Seraphile Less efficient Primary producers such as trees and plants may adapt, but oceanic primary producers (which are the earth's largest footprint of primary producers) are EXTREMELY vulnerable to changes in O2
[3:09:51] <%AncelDeLambert> honestly, I'm still not sure what they were doing in this lab
[3:09:55] <%XeroSigmaPrime> @Seraphile phytoplankton specifically
[3:10:21] <@lewdskeletor13> @anceldelambert Did you finish the quest line? It’s explained
[3:10:21] <@Moobot> Hey, if you guys feel like checking out The Outer Worlds on account of this stream or cause you think I'm cool, go ahead and use this link https://bit.ly/2JmpB3Q to grab it off Greenman Gaming, and I'll get a few bucks kicked back. Thanks!
[3:10:26] <%honeyman18> Its explained later, just know its fucked
[3:10:28] <%Daniel_Is_I> A scientist.
[3:10:28] <CursedNobleman> i hope they make a detailed wiki like the fallout vault so i can have the game explained to a dumbass like me LUL
[3:10:31] <Seraphile> tbf I think all the stuff sensitive to that is already dead from sulfur
[3:10:31] <%Kirby_Sauce> a hero
[3:10:31] <%AncelDeLambert> I haven't delivered the gas, yet
[3:10:34] <+griffball13> science jesus

[3:10:58] <CursedNobleman> bwah bwah bwah, its rizzos!
[3:11:01] <dekkitout> They were doing science
[3:11:02] <+A123yourdead> My mom
[3:11:02] <%XeroSigmaPrime> @Seraphile Thats why taking care of oceans is ASTRONOMICALLY more important than forests (though thats still very important)
[3:11:03] <redsynod> ;_;7
[3:11:07] <%roundaboutrevengeance> I never read that on my playthrough, thank you for doing so
[3:11:10] <SaltyDavid> The stuff they did in here was big plot important
[3:11:17] <%AncelDeLambert> Captain America juice

[3:12:20] <+griffball13> yeah fuck saftey
[3:12:26] <Seraphile> you know whats sad
[3:12:28] <ManlyMcBeefington> chat, how did pat's deal with the iconoclast in end?
[3:12:30] <%AncelDeLambert> platforming, yayyyyyyy
[3:12:34] <dekkitout> Hopefully the support ticket doesn't leak your private information Kappa
[3:12:37] <+drawdehellfire> Yeah! He's gonna get it!
[3:12:39] <%AncelDeLambert> I mean, it's pretty easy platforming, but still
[3:12:42] <Seraphile> this isn't even close to the most nefarious secret thing the board does

[3:14:32] <+TONYOO101> he might want to if he hasnt
[3:14:35] <Seraphile> ; )
[3:14:45] <%bread_assassin> Read the logs? There was a whole quadrant of the lab Pat ignored.
[3:14:56] <%honeyman18> Rizzo's, CANDY, BOOZE, HUMAN GENETIC EXPERIMENTS
[3:15:00] <Monkeyweed21> pat go back
[3:15:01] <+TONYOO101> ooph
[3:15:03] <LandOfTheWay> no joke, that gun trivialized every fight for me. just point it at the toughest thing around and watch it kill its allies while your companions it
[3:15:16] <%AncelDeLambert> is it worth it to go through the steam at this point?
[3:15:18] <SaltyDavid> There was a terminal behind the steam
[3:15:18] <LandOfTheWay> *companions kill it
[3:15:29] <%AncelDeLambert> @LandOfTheWay that sounds boring as hell, not gonna lie
[3:15:30] <%GarbageNirvana> Yeah mind control like that in any game like this is broken
[3:15:39] <Monkeyweed21> termonal up ladder has logs
[3:15:41] <CursedNobleman> wow, this ocarina of time 3ds remake did the textures over, its pretty crisp
[3:15:49] <%GarbageNirvana> And it works on everything
[3:15:52] <+RAAAAAINMAKER> tank it
[3:15:54] <+drawdehellfire> Just timing
[3:15:54] <%lotharrio> Be a man and run through steam.

[3:16:37] <SaltyDavid> Maybe do a little puff puff before going in the steam
[3:16:43] <%bread_assassin> Ok, it was more like one room, but it's an important room.
[3:16:48] <%Kirby_Sauce> logs on the upper one
[3:16:53] <%otakuisaiah> It was a calculated risk, but man is @AngriestPat bad at math.
[3:17:15] <allanmiri> Elmo slumber.
[3:17:18] <LandOfTheWay> solved about 95% of my problems with stealth and dialogue. that gun made the remaining 5% a joke
[3:17:23] <DefaultSettiings> Elmo ded

[3:22:23] <allanmiri> The board is basically getting shit all over the galaxy.

[3:23:44] <LandOfTheWay> @saltydavid oh, that's extra weird. she fell before all the companions gather at the table to discuss the plan, so she wasn't there and then was assumed dead in the ending
[3:23:53] <%Piemen99> WHY

[3:24:24] <%honeyman18> Your legs PAT
[3:24:28] <rossnwolf> Within 1 meter of a ledge
[3:24:28] <%King_Wolf_Rigger> Temperment -1? Fuck that
[3:24:37] <+TONYOO101> it only occurs if you're on a ledge, which never happens
[3:24:40] <%AncelDeLambert> am I alone in finding Parvati's romance rushed?
[3:24:48] <%lotharrio> Get mauled by canids for awhile. Canids are weak fucks anyway.
[3:24:49] <Nina96> !uptime
[3:24:50] <@Moobot> I've been playing this game for how long? Oh only 3h 24m.
[3:24:54] <%roundaboutrevengeance> Explode, you mean like his legs JUST DID
[3:24:55] <%Bobbledygook> oh it's super rushed
[3:24:55] <Seraphile> what happens if you have temperment -2
[3:24:56] <Aquaczaz> what kind of build you rocking?
[3:25:10] <%DrFacilier> maybe its assumed people go a long time before actually talking to her about it
[3:25:14] <%King_Wolf_Rigger> @AncelDeLambert eh, it's a little rushed, but it's only a 40 hour or so game.
[3:25:18] <SaltyDavid> I've only seen 1 Temperament check in the whole game
[3:25:18] <%honeyman18> @anceldelambert I just thought her quest was too padded out and its .mostly a wallet check.
[3:25:19] <Aquaczaz> hell yeah, same as me. did me quite well
[3:25:21] <allanmiri> I always went with flaws that increased damage from something. Like plasma, acid or shock. I had so many healing items that I could just out heal the damage.
[3:25:39] <redsynod> I went full skull monkey. barely touched the combat skills
[3:25:39] <@Moobot> Hey, if you guys feel like checking out The Outer Worlds on account of this stream or cause you think I'm cool, go ahead and use this link https://bit.ly/2JmpB3Q to grab it off Greenman Gaming, and I'll get a few bucks kicked back. Thanks!
[3:25:49] <redsynod> *Skill Monkey
[3:25:54] <rossnwolf> I don't think it's rushed. Keep in mind this is their first date and Pavarti is just a big huge coward and is trying to keep it from happening
[3:26:08] <fgiting> !uptime
[3:26:09] <@Moobot> I've been playing this game for how long? Oh only 3h 26m.
[3:26:11] <+drawdehellfire> The only downside to this game is that not everyone is bi and horny. :(
[3:26:16] <LandOfTheWay> @saltydavid neither was i. like i said, quick fix was to load a point prior to the table talk, go walk around with her in my party, and then the game realized something was wrong, processed her as dead, and then respawned her
[3:26:18] <%King_Wolf_Rigger> @redsynod I liked skull monkey. You think with the thing in your skull.
[3:26:23] <allanmiri> Aliens
[3:26:39] <%honeyman18> Sub-Light is super vital to finish for lore and plot

[3:31:36] <Seraphile> @SaltyDavid do you have a clip of the lilya moment?
[3:31:38] <%luftraumm1> I never got this too

[3:31:51] <%Black_Machete> I didn't ether
[3:31:56] <%scaryboisupreme> i just got it
[3:32:00] <%scaryboisupreme> It's pretty neatr
[3:32:12] <Aquaczaz> I'm pretty sure I missed like 75% of this game
[3:32:29] <%luftraumm1> everyone has ducking moon man masks
[3:32:35] <%luftraumm1> godamn
[3:32:41] <Aquaczaz> 38K? jesus I never got over 20K
[3:32:42] <@lewdskeletor13> Cuz Moon Gang
[3:32:46] <%King_Wolf_Rigger> MOON GANG
[3:32:47] <Dakuu75> someone is new here
[3:32:58] <dekkitout> Moon Crew "We Do It"
[3:32:58] <Aquaczaz> I'm so bad at exploration, I hate it
[3:33:00] <%scaryboisupreme> am i the only one who fucking hates that cystypig ad
[3:33:01] <%luftraumm1> that's great
[3:33:02] <%DrFacilier> snailthrough
[3:33:03] <SaltyDavid> @Seraphile She basically says "If you see something you can't explain run away" And you can respond "Look out for cosmic horrors. Got it"

[3:33:06] <+Elky3> give the robot a moon mask chariCRY
[3:33:11] <misterspotswood> pat really likes the YTMND bit
[3:33:13] <Zaphire_Saucypants> @scaryboisupreme no I hate it too
[3:33:14] <%GarbageNirvana> apatGib
[3:33:14] <Seraphile> play it like a crpg enthusiast
[3:33:16] <SaltyDavid> It spooked the hell outta me
[3:33:17] <+drawdehellfire> I hate how tinker cost goes up with times tinkered instead of item level
[3:33:22] <+rdark_ksu> Im nearly at 30 hrs and think i have at least 1/4th game left
[3:33:23] <Aquaczaz> I don't hate exploration, I hate that I'm bad at it
[3:33:25] <+hkey_local_machine> I beat it for the 2nd time today - never went to the groundbreaker at all.
[3:33:26] <@lewdskeletor13> Baby caaaaat
[3:33:28] <%Black_Machete> I did it at ~40HR
[3:34:12] <Dakuu75> Rip Ya A New One
[3:34:19] <%scaryboisupreme> it's weird how the FORCE gun isn't marked as Unique when it's the only one in the game
[3:34:20] <Zaphire_Saucypants> ah...must be because I didn't give him the schematic. I sold dat bitch.
[3:34:28] <%GarbageNirvana> GUN GUN GUN GUN
[3:34:29] <%King_Wolf_Rigger> the RYNO was great
[3:34:32] <%marsanta> Yeah I sold the schematic so I didn't get this
[3:34:34] <+griffball13> i respect that
[3:34:40] <%luftraumm1> oh I sold the schematics too
[3:34:42] <%rumtumtugnutz> no kill him
[3:34:45] <%King_Wolf_Rigger> Only level 11
[3:34:46] <%scaryboisupreme> fools
[3:34:47] <Zaphire_Saucypants> what's it doooo
[3:34:48] <Seraphile> shaw is a weirdo you can respect
[3:34:52] <%Black_Machete> sold it made the bolter
[3:34:54] <SaltyDavid> Lilya talking about cosmic horrors felt a bit more legit because Ash in Amber Heights tells you a story that sounds like he basically saw space Cthulu and I got hyped/spooked even more
[3:35:02] <%SGrim> Level 11 and 180 dps. Fuck
[3:35:04] <Charuzu> pew pew
[3:35:10] <CursedNobleman> LUL
[3:35:12] <Zaphire_Saucypants> bouncy acid bullets
[3:35:14] <+griffball13> it's unaccurate
[3:35:17] <%scaryboisupreme> it's probably best for a companion
[3:35:27] <LandOfTheWay> ricochet gun
[3:35:34] <Seraphile> @SaltyDavid nothing spooked me like Ash's story in this game, sad you never hear more along the lines of that tale
[3:35:34] <+JacktheMan18> nice pew pew noises
[3:35:38] <Zaphire_Saucypants> what is it with this guy and ricochet stuff?
[3:35:39] <+Moy_Luna> So pat, what would you say is the Worst Spacer or any other companies product by far.
[3:35:55] <Aquaczaz> wow you're already at the level I beat the game at haha
[3:35:59] <+RAAAAAINMAKER> <cat noises>
[3:36:02] <Aquaczaz> I missed so much
[3:36:12] <%GarbageNirvana> Did they do it with hippie Max tho?
[3:36:28] <%luftraumm1> light assault weapon with n-rays was my endgame weapon
[3:36:31] <allanmiri> Ada doesn't want to hurt anyone she just wants SAM to clean her because she's a dirty girl.
[3:36:48] <Aquaczaz> @luftraumm1 that's what I ended up with too
[3:36:49] <@lewdskeletor13> Max’s dialogue on the ship actually changes after his quest, pretty interesting
[3:36:54] <Zaphire_Saucypants> you seem better
[3:36:58] <+griffball13> redbull is a hell of a drug
[3:37:04] <$RubberFistFight> jfc, I'm sick of people telling me to be less blunt and then pretending like they don't know what I'm trying to say when I be less blunt. MOTHERFUCKER WHY DO YOU THINK I'M SO BLUNT GODDAMNIT.
[3:37:21] <%luftraumm1> @aquaczaz its stacks a bunch too wich is awesome
[3:37:24] <%GarbageNirvana> Hope this is worth fucking your sleep schedule up for
[3:37:26] <+drawdehellfire> @RubberFistFight wat
[3:37:28] <Moonlit_Wisp> That person looked pretty damn dead
[3:37:31] <%honeyman18> Spacers Choice made it first
[3:37:33] <SaltyDavid> Remember when the Moonman in Groundbreaker said Spacer's Choice doesn't sell toothpaste at this time?
[3:37:39] <misterspotswood> how does time work? like when that said it was 3000 days, is it a standardized time for all planets/moons or does each have their own time, or just "shut up dont worry about it"
[3:37:41] <Zaphire_Saucypants> alternative route to the mountain top
[3:37:42] <SaltyDavid> Now they do! :D
[3:37:42] <Aquaczaz> oh it does? that explains a lot
[3:37:45] <%luftraumm1> hmm
[3:38:15] <$RubberFistFight> @drawdehellfire I take fire a lot for being blunt because "it's rude". But then when I try to communicate a little more deferentially, the people I'm talking to act confused and say they don't know what I'm trying to say. It's FUCKING INFURIATING.
[3:38:18] <Aquaczaz> I also ended up not firing a single bullet for the entire last section
[3:38:19] <+RAAAAAINMAKER> has Pat completed Vicar Max's quest?
[3:38:25] <%Black_Machete> hold it
[3:38:32] <Zaphire_Saucypants> seems to me the effects of the science weapons are VERY short lived.
[3:38:33] <@lewdskeletor13> He has
[3:38:40] <%Tredecian> hold the beam they take damage and fight for you while being shot
[3:38:41] <+Sleepy_Puma> This game seems like it feels like bioshock
[3:38:42] <Moonlit_Wisp> just dont die 4Head
[3:38:51] <Seraphile> take drug
[3:38:53] <Seraphile> to unlock
[3:39:07] <Dakuu75> what the UNHOLY hell was that sound effect
[3:39:10] <%luftraumm1> that beam works best with lower damage
[3:39:12] <Aquaczaz> @Zaphire_Saucypants they are, you're meant to fire continuously to deal damage+the effect
[3:39:12] <%King_Wolf_Rigger> @RubberFistFight I think they might be getting "blunt" and "overly aggressive" mixed up.
[3:39:18] <%AncelDeLambert> I would have liked some Bioshock-y powers, it would have mixed things up some
[3:39:18] <%Daniel_Is_I> It's not the best choice
[3:39:20] <+drawdehellfire> @Dakuu75 It sounded like Star Wars
[3:39:27] <Moonlit_Wisp> It makes them attack the other enemies I think
[3:39:38] <redsynod> like the maul song
[3:39:42] <+Sleepy_Puma> but you get a perk tho
[3:39:45] <+VashyronM> do it coward
[3:39:45] <+TOONFOOD> herpaderpaphobia
[3:39:54] <%AncelDeLambert> all of the flaws suck ass because the perks are underwhelming
[3:40:01] <+rdark_ksu> yea the flaws suck
[3:40:04] <%AbnormalVoid> he yawn apatPorgmo
[3:40:09] <%Tredecian> mindcontrol ray works on a jingle b tw
[3:40:10] <Aquaczaz> have you taken any flaws? I never did since the perk never outweighed benefits
[3:40:17] <dekkitout> Are any of these flaws good? At this point flaws might as well be on the hardcore mode as a forced thing
[3:40:21] <%GarbageNirvana> The addiction flaws are probably the least detrimental because you just have to use items every so often
[3:40:21] <%luftraumm1> perks had to be way better for flaws to be worth it
[3:40:22] <+RAAAAAINMAKER> why would it matter you stood thee and let your companions kill mantiqueens
[3:40:24] <+griffball13> @AngriestPat yes
[3:40:27] <TechDragon_Z> Work better on people maybe?
[3:40:29] <%AncelDeLambert> there's never been a perk I HAD to have, so I never bothered with the flaws
[3:40:29] <misterspotswood> correct
[3:40:34] <@lewdskeletor13> The flaws needed better balance
[3:40:35] <%GarbageNirvana> But yeah a lot of the perks are unfortunately underwhelming
[3:40:36] <%roundaboutrevengeance> Is it true that the debuff only occurs while the condition is present (aka: mantasaurs) or is it universal?
[3:40:38] <%honeyman18> Mind Ray fires High speed Slogans
[3:40:42] <TechDragon_Z> I never tried it myself

[3:40:49] <%AncelDeLambert> LUL
[3:40:51] <$RubberFistFight> @King_Wolf_Rigger The funny thing is, I consistently got high marks in school for anything communications-based, and actually got praised on how well I communicate in general. So I'm pretty sure the problem isn't me.
[3:40:52] <TechDragon_Z> Pat there's a drop there.
[3:40:52] <+Elky3> I feel like this games combat will run smoother if there was sliding and mantling bingHmm
[3:40:53] <DesuDesuDokiDoki> LUL
[3:40:54] <TechDragon_Z> Pat watchout
[3:40:55] <Zaphire_Saucypants> only flaws I ever took were the ones for corrosion damage and robots. I immediately regretted the robots. BUUUuuut...at least I can hear Sam scream "AHHHHHH"
[3:40:55] <allanmiri> F
[3:40:56] <misterspotswood> damn you gravity
[3:40:57] <Aquaczaz> yeah the mind ray is amazing for gun people
[3:41:01] <DesuDesuDokiDoki> pat look out
[3:41:09] <%luftraumm1> shoot the body with shotgun
[3:41:10] <$RubberFistFight> @AngriestPat look out pat there's a ledge
[3:41:16] <%GarbageNirvana> If Obsidian gets around to making an Outer Worlds 2 hopefully they make the perks more enticing or the flaws less debilitating
[3:41:37] <Aquaczaz> mind ray was one of my more used guns actually
[3:41:38] <misterspotswood> dont fall
[3:41:41] <Dakuu75> @AngriestPat that's not bothering you like a spoiler?
[3:41:42] <%GarbageNirvana> Wonder how well this game's been selling anywya
[3:41:44] <%GarbageNirvana> *anyway
[3:41:46] <TechDragon_Z> Ya know I never took the cave entrance to reach the broker. I always took the mountain path.
[3:41:50] <Aquaczaz> had a lot of fun with the shrink ray too
[3:41:51] <%AncelDeLambert> I hope OW2 has better perks, better guns, and more square footage of world, cuz this is kinda light
[3:41:53] <Zaphire_Saucypants> kill it
[3:41:55] <%rumtumtugnutz> Mind Reed Tolson in Edgewater. He's a scamp he is.
[3:41:59] <Sokumotanaka> they hunt in packs arisen

[3:42:22] <%AncelDeLambert> Pat, just give it up
[3:42:25] <%Run44forrest> Up dog
[3:42:33] <%Piemen99> Is the gun singing?
[3:42:36] <%rumtumtugnutz> what an annoying gun.
[3:42:37] <%AbnormalVoid> I'm not the only one who hears that right?
[3:42:38] <+drawdehellfire> Who is Up Dog?
[3:42:39] <%AncelDeLambert> I don't think this gun is doing dick
[3:42:40] <Aquaczaz> it does the jingle yeah
[3:42:47] <%King_Wolf_Rigger> @RubberFistFight That may be, but I've notice you have a tendency to jump down folks' throats when trying to make a point. Usually ending things with stuff like "What don't you get"
[3:42:54] <%luftraumm1> look, this game is incredible, but it seems like a first step in a "new" old direction, so i bet obsidian guys were cautious with new systems
[3:43:03] <@lewdskeletor13> The gun is only useful on enemies with guns
[3:43:18] <allanmiri> Seems legit
[3:43:19] <%King_Wolf_Rigger> He wanted that sweet queen booty
[3:43:21] <+rdark_ksu> this guy is unique
[3:43:30] <Zaphire_Saucypants> I like his stupid helmet.
[3:43:31] <%honeyman18> Shit I like this, but damn am I sleepy.
[3:43:47] <%AncelDeLambert> this guy's a dork. Not as much a dork as his subordinate, but still a dork
[3:43:51] <%Run44forrest> Oooohh oh law is oh god
[3:43:51] <%rumtumtugnutz> go to station for good gun.
[3:44:02] <LandOfTheWay> i found the gun really useful since it completely incapacitstes whoever you target while your companions shoot them
[3:44:03] <TechDragon_Z> Ready for some THUNDER?!

[3:44:36] <Frostydough1> No midnight release Death Stranding? peepoSad
[3:44:36] <Zaphire_Saucypants> hmmm...cool. Depends on what ending for Monarch you want tho.
[3:44:38] <Aquaczaz> I forgot death stranding exists now, have you started it already?
[3:44:50] <%King_Wolf_Rigger> I would complain if I was dying

[3:45:52] <%luftraumm1> wish I had a ps4
[3:45:56] <%AncelDeLambert> this chick is a DORK
[3:45:56] <Zaphire_Saucypants> yeah...I'm gonna have to hold off on watching your Death Stranding stream. Wanna experience it for myself.
[3:45:57] <@lewdskeletor13> No Kojima cancelled the game to avoid spoilers
[3:46:00] <+drawdehellfire> What a pretty lady
[3:46:05] <%AncelDeLambert> DORK
[3:46:11] <+xBolts4Lifex> can we kill space commies?
[3:46:14] <misterspotswood> calm down bad ass
[3:46:15] <%rumtumtugnutz> Also I dunno, I imagine someone cranking one out but like a peppermill.
[3:46:18] <%AncelDeLambert> frikkin dork
[3:46:24] <TechDragon_Z> Does she usually ask marauders if they're marauders?
[3:46:25] <Zaphire_Saucypants> man, I stealth sniped teh FUCK out of this place.
[3:46:39] <+RootShaman> Lady don't tell me you've got a unique gun
[3:46:40] <Seraphile> in sync robots
[3:46:43] <%rumtumtugnutz> If you go to the C3 outpost theres another uniqwue weapon
[3:46:44] <Seraphile> lil dance
[3:46:45] <%King_Wolf_Rigger> She reminds me of a 50s era space hero.
[3:46:47] <+RAAAAAINMAKER> throw up the horns
[3:46:52] <$SpecterHDMC> wut wtf i never seen any of these people going up the mountain
[3:46:53] <+RAAAAAINMAKER> Hail Satan
[3:46:59] <misterspotswood> just go kill em for her
[3:47:02] <allanmiri> These fucking people.
[3:47:04] <Zaphire_Saucypants> okay Gung Ho Joy.
[3:47:07] <redsynod> wow I never met these doofuses
[3:47:12] <%rumtumtugnutz> I accidentally killed these people
[3:47:13] <%AncelDeLambert> nah, let these idiots brave the compound, let them die
[3:47:16] <+drawdehellfire> Go down the hill
[3:47:23] <%rumtumtugnutz> By marauding.
[3:47:28] <%Black_Machete> you will know soon
[3:47:29] <%honeyman18> You're stupid
[3:47:30] <@lewdskeletor13> I’ve done three playthroughs and never met these dorks
[3:47:38] <+drawdehellfire> Hi Pat :)
[3:47:41] <$SpecterHDMC> wtf
[3:47:43] <+RootShaman> I didn't think it was possible to get in without meeting them
[3:47:44] <%AncelDeLambert> @lewdskeletor13 really? huh.
[3:47:45] <%rumtumtugnutz> Unique gun in the house.
[3:47:50] <%rumtumtugnutz> Its pretty OK.
[3:47:51] <+RAAAAAINMAKER> free loot
[3:47:52] <Aquaczaz> corporate laziness, just like everything else that's gone wrong
[3:48:26] <%AncelDeLambert> I mean, mercenaries have always been companies, in both senses of the word
[3:48:48] <%AncelDeLambert> And mercs don't really exist to fight, they exist as the POSSIBILITY of a fight
[3:49:04] <+RootShaman> Mutually assured security
[3:49:11] <icemochablunt> what are you saying, that this is some kind of "outer world" or something?
[3:49:14] <misterspotswood> "idk man ive killed a loooot of people"
[3:49:16] <%AncelDeLambert> ...dork
[3:49:24] <%King_Wolf_Rigger> GUN
[3:49:26] <TechDragon_Z> Bring the THUNDER
[3:49:31] <DesuDesuDokiDoki> T H U N D E R
[3:49:34] <%rumtumtugnutz> that is an OK GUN
[3:49:38] <redsynod> by tunder
[3:49:43] <@lewdskeletor13> I’m starting to like these fucking dorks
[3:49:46] <dekkitout> That is indeed a whol ass gun
[3:49:50] <+RAAAAAINMAKER> Tinker it
[3:49:52] <%rumtumtugnutz> Lord tunderin jaysus
[3:50:04] <%scaryboisupreme> The Bazz's gun
[3:50:05] <%AncelDeLambert> spice and wolf did mercenaries really good in that one arc
[3:50:25] <%King_Wolf_Rigger> Tinker it up to your level
[3:50:29] <DesuDesuDokiDoki> yeyeye lvl the THUNDER
[3:50:43] <Taffer85> weeesources
[3:50:45] <%luftraumm1> unique weapons end up being worse than the same effects on regular ones
[3:50:45] <%AncelDeLambert> I already had a shock sniper, so I threw Thunder in the box
[3:50:55] <+mlow44> Thunder sucks
[3:51:01] <Zaphire_Saucypants> smug fuck
[3:51:03] <allanmiri> Jesus Christ these mercs
[3:51:09] <%AncelDeLambert> that's another thing they NEED to fix in a sequel: unique weapons have to be worth a squirt
[3:51:23] <Taffer85> by the time you get most of the uniques, theyre worse than regular weapons
[3:51:33] <Zaphire_Saucypants> yeaaah...the unique guns in this game were...not so great.
[3:51:34] <%luftraumm1> maybe tweak the tinker mechanic
[3:51:42] <%AncelDeLambert> honestly, they should probably go back to atom with the weapon system should they do a sequel, cuz this aint great
[3:51:42] <DesuDesuDokiDoki> cool name tho
[3:51:44] <Monkeyweed21> its better than your shock pistol
[3:52:03] <%johnny_gogo> you could level it up for really cheap
[3:52:05] <Lurantis_> Man the views tanked on the stream, not many people enjoying the game? I thought it was great
[3:52:20] <%AncelDeLambert> tinkering sucks because I get too invested in the weapons I have and don't look for new ones, or wait for new ones and wield sucky garbage for ten hours
[3:52:25] <%SGrim> Liking to be used Kreygasm
[3:52:29] <Taffer85> muh piece haHAA
[3:52:30] <Djinnazz> I like this lady
[3:52:30] <@lewdskeletor13> @lurantis_ It’s also 2 am
[3:52:34] <%honeyman18> Kinky
[3:52:35] <%King_Wolf_Rigger> Joy is pretty great
[3:52:37] <TechDragon_Z> She probably tells her gun bedtime stories. Strikes me as the type.
[3:52:37] <%luftraumm1> RPGs don't do so well on twitch generally
[3:52:45] <%Ner234> Bitch if you shoot me ....
[3:52:46] <%AncelDeLambert> @Lurantis_ oh, it's good. It's good writing and story, it's just that the main combat loop leaves something to be desired
[3:52:47] <%AdmiralButtloaf> i find her annoying
[3:52:50] <Dakuu75> ok, her "my gun is alive" talk is getting annoying. she sounds like a child trying to be tough
[3:52:55] <%johnny_gogo> @AngriestPat YOU CAN GO FROM THE BACK
[3:53:00] <Zaphire_Saucypants> I like that the stream is super chill right now actually. Chat not EXPLODING.
[3:53:03] <Lurantis_> @lewdskeletor13 holy shit I forgot other timezones exist other than PT, please ignore my dumb ass
[3:53:06] <+mlow44> @Dakuu75 That's kind of the intent
[3:53:08] <%AncelDeLambert> @johnny_gogo there's a back?
[3:53:13] <%johnny_gogo> YEAH
[3:53:15] <%johnny_gogo> woops
[3:53:19] <%johnny_gogo> yeah
[3:53:27] <%johnny_gogo> you go up the hill next to the C3
[3:53:30] <Zaphire_Saucypants> there's multiple approaches to this one, Patto.
[3:53:31] <Taffer85> who needs to sneak when everything dies instantly anyways
[3:53:39] <%johnny_gogo> it behind there base
[3:53:41] <%AncelDeLambert> you have an army, Pat, whatevs
[3:53:42] <DesuDesuDokiDoki> kill em all
[3:53:51] <%AncelDeLambert> oh, shit, there's a unique hammer over there, I forgot
[3:53:53] <%johnny_gogo> Also secreat hammer
[3:53:57] <%johnny_gogo> ye
[3:54:04] <%AncelDeLambert> STOP! Hammer time.
[3:54:05] <Zaphire_Saucypants> oh YEAH, the joke hammer
[3:54:07] <%johnny_gogo> its in that rock
[3:54:07] <+RootShaman> mood
[3:54:07] <%King_Wolf_Rigger> Parvati cares
[3:54:11] <%luftraumm1> secret hammer is quite interesting
[3:54:16] <%AncelDeLambert> it has a funny name
[3:54:17] <%GoogleyGareth> jermaPluto
[3:54:24] <+RootShaman> I stopped caring about weapons by this point
[3:54:44] <%AncelDeLambert> honestly, uniques only exist to look at and have
[3:54:52] <Lehmbrick> i mean your playing on normal
[3:54:55] <+TravisSchnee> how much of this game is shooting people humanoid things vs shooting monster aliens would you say % whise? @angriestpat
[3:55:01] <+gralho> nothing that mods cant fix
[3:55:05] <Dakuu75> you're able to sort everything by weight, name, value, weight & value. it's pretty sweet
[3:55:08] <%AncelDeLambert> ... bout 50 50
[3:55:09] <%johnny_gogo> when i got here i put it on hard
[3:55:11] <%roundaboutrevengeance> Just set the game to hard already
[3:55:11] <%GarbageNirvana> Sounds like it's time to up the difficulty
[3:55:11] <%johnny_gogo> it was fun
[3:55:15] <Zaphire_Saucypants> Like the Pink Slip. My modded and tinkered sniper gun was so much better.
[3:55:16] <TechDragon_Z> Even on SUpernova it gets hilariously easy, although you and you're crew (except for SAM) are kind of glass cannons
[3:55:18] <Monkeyweed21> is this functionally any djfferent from Indivisible at this point? @AngriestPat
[3:55:33] <fruit_pie_the_magician> @AngriestPat Put it on hard, I bet you won't notice the difference
[3:55:33] <%Run44forrest> Turn on hard mode then coward
[3:55:35] <Lehmbrick> @GarbageNirvana its pat he wont do that hell just complain lol
[3:55:57] <%rumtumtugnutz> He's not even really complaining
[3:55:57] <@Moobot> Hey, if you guys feel like checking out The Outer Worlds on account of this stream or cause you think I'm cool, go ahead and use this link https://bit.ly/2JmpB3Q to grab it off Greenman Gaming, and I'll get a few bucks kicked back. Thanks!
[3:56:02] <+TravisSchnee> sbfpWipeouts
[3:56:11] <%GarbageNirvana> To keep things interesting?
[3:56:13] <%honeyman18> Flat skill points is what killed me, max lvl characters just end up with necessary stats for the best enings.
[3:56:18] <+TOONFOOD> Defo wish I changed it over to hard. still enjoyed it though.
[3:56:43] <+RootShaman> was there something next to that pad
[3:56:50] <fruit_pie_the_magician> @AngriestPat I only turned it on hard so I could shoot them more times before they died while they were floating around from the gloop gun
[3:56:50] <+RootShaman> you missed something next to that text log
[3:57:01] <Lurantis_> I kinda wish the game had more unique weapons
[3:57:08] <%luftraumm1> the beauty in thirds grande it's more in the world building and writing, the gameplay is just a vessel for that
[3:57:08] <%AncelDeLambert> Yahtzee's Zero Punctuation on this game really hits a lot of salient points, it's hard to argue with him.
[3:57:24] <%AncelDeLambert> well hello to you too, sunshine
[3:57:51] <+RootShaman> This game feels like it paved the way for a better sequel lol
[3:58:04] <%luftraumm1> felt the same way
[3:58:06] <+RootShaman> I say that as someone who did like it though
[3:58:10] <+drawdehellfire> Oh god, I just went to make cup ramen for lunch and accidentally started putting coffee in it instead of hot water
[3:58:13] <%rumtumtugnutz> Anyway, if Pat is enjoying himself, why should he change the difficulty?
[3:58:16] <%AncelDeLambert> this is a proof of concept for Obsidian as an independent developer, and in that regard, it's good
[3:58:24] <ALTRNico> Shadow Broker BibleThump
[3:58:25] <%rumtumtugnutz> I bet this game won't get a sequel.
[3:58:34] <%King_Wolf_Rigger> Is that a dig against Mass Effect?
[3:58:39] <Nina96> OKAY BROKER
[3:58:41] <@lewdskeletor13> This game will absolutely get a sequel
[3:58:44] <RagingLeo> ok broker
[3:58:46] <%AncelDeLambert> probably not an ACTUAL sequel, but Obsidian will probably work on a spiritual successor
[3:58:49] <%rumtumtugnutz> It may get some big DLC, but I have doubts about actual sequels
[3:58:53] <%luftraumm1> feels super proof of concept indeed
[3:59:03] <@lewdskeletor13> They’ve already talked about a sequel
[3:59:06] <%AncelDeLambert> I don't think we'll be returning to the Colony
[3:59:08] <Zaphire_Saucypants> I dunno...with the way this game ended, I certainly smell a sequel.
[3:59:14] <%honeyman18> I can FEEL the miner planet DLC coming
[3:59:21] <redsynod> another star system then?
[3:59:27] <%rumtumtugnutz> I take it that means you didn;'t get the easy ending, then.
[3:59:33] <%AncelDeLambert> probably another star system, that's what I'd do
[3:59:43] <%rumtumtugnutz> I mean there's a whole planet you don't even go to.
[3:59:51] <+goatbait> goatbait subscribed with Twitch Prime. 
[3:59:56] <%luftraumm1> we're getting pretty close to spoiler territory
[4:00:08] <+RootShaman> yeah I was gonna say its hard to talk about more without spoil
[4:00:09] <%King_Wolf_Rigger> Another star system would take place in like 1000 into the future.
[4:00:09] <%derap41> !uptime
[4:00:10] <@Moobot> I've been playing this game for how long? Oh only 4h 11s.
[4:00:12] <%AncelDeLambert> Pat's reached the point I'm at, so it's all speculation from me
[4:00:12] <Zaphire_Saucypants> yeah...les not get into specifics.
[4:00:13] <+RAAAAAINMAKER> Maybe they could get the Deus Ex IP and fix that franchise
[4:00:27] <%honeyman18> This corporate nightmare shit is perfect with the Historic parallels to the horror shit they did to miners in real life.
[4:00:44] <%derap41> He's on Tararus?
[4:00:45] <Zaphire_Saucypants> this is hilarious
[4:01:01] <%luftraumm1> nah keep doing original stuff, let IPs die addy this point
[4:01:05] <%AncelDeLambert> this is Pat and my nightmare
[4:01:23] <%AncelDeLambert> good job, Pat
[4:01:23] <Zaphire_Saucypants> seems so
[4:01:23] <%rumtumtugnutz> One time I was camping and the outhouse didn;t have a door.
[4:01:25] <allanmiri> I'd like to see Obsidian do a fantasy RPG. Old sword and shield era stuff.
[4:01:30] <Zaphire_Saucypants> bunch o' chumps
[4:01:37] <%honeyman18> Pat inhale
[4:01:41] <+JacktheMan18> You mean you don't enjoy watching people shower while you poop? 4Head
[4:01:52] <TechDragon_Z> GG Berthold
[4:01:56] <+RootShaman> @allanmiri Pillars of Eternity?
[4:01:59] <+RAAAAAINMAKER> 6 shots, I just need 6 shots
[4:02:12] <allanmiri> I meant in this style
[4:02:16] <+RootShaman> oh lol
[4:02:18] <%AncelDeLambert> @rumtumtugnutz my community college had geology outings every year, out to Death Valley. They told me they would dig an open air latrine with only a three sided screen set up. I immediately noped out.
[4:02:53] <%King_Wolf_Rigger> @rumtumtugnutz That's a living nightmare. I've been peeped on twice in public bathrooms, and the lights shut off while I was in the stall. I do not use public bathrooms anymore.
[4:02:56] <+RootShaman> Geology departments are a different breed lol
[4:03:01] <+RootShaman> Wacky people those lot
[4:03:15] <%AncelDeLambert> Geologists are wierd. The subject is cool as hell, but they're WEIRD.
[4:03:17] <+RootShaman> The true hippys of the scientific community
[4:03:18] <%rumtumtugnutz> @AncelDeLambert I don't mind hunkering over a log, it comes with bush camping. But when you go somewhere where there's supposed to be facilities and there's no door on the shitter that's a Bad Time.
[4:03:22] <%DrFacilier> Death Stranding will be available Thursday night. just double checked
[4:03:25] <VigilantShield> besides the shooting bit
[4:03:44] <%AncelDeLambert> I hate camping, to boot, so I was pure out
[4:03:53] <%rumtumtugnutz> @King_Wolf_Rigger They have automatic lights at my work, so when I poop at night it gets dark and freaks me out sometimes
[4:03:55] <Zaphire_Saucypants> I like Hiram, sassy fuck.
[4:03:55] <%honeyman18> Just remember that Violence is ALWAYS a solution that's available.
[4:04:26] <%Ner234> PAY ME
[4:04:41] <%King_Wolf_Rigger> @rumtumtugnutz Yeah, I've had that happen too. But it's awful when someone walks out and flips the switch and ignores you when you shout out.
[4:04:52] <%rumtumtugnutz> Violence is not the answer. PAY ME is the answer. Violence is the work we do to answer the question.
[4:05:03] <%roundaboutrevengeance> After getting recommended the Zero Punctuation review by this chat, I was reminded why I unsubed after my "edgy teenager" phase.
[4:05:16] <%rumtumtugnutz> @King_Wolf_Rigger Gives me flashbacks to high school. >> Ugh.
[4:05:17] <+RootShaman> "you're not an easy man to find, Broker" is a reference I think
[4:05:23] <%roundaboutrevengeance> back to enjoying the stream
[4:05:23] <+RootShaman> but I can't remember what the source is lol
[4:05:33] <+JacktheMan18> SAM low key roasting
[4:05:40] <%King_Wolf_Rigger> @rumtumtugnutz Why are people absolute shits? lol
[4:05:52] <Zaphire_Saucypants> you did the side quests, Pat.
[4:05:56] <Zaphire_Saucypants> for the factions.
[4:06:00] <lol_red_ranger> this quests is easy to do out of sequence
[4:06:05] <Nina96> SAM > everyone else
[4:06:09] <lol_red_ranger> like why would you rush straight here and not do side quests
[4:06:25] <%rumtumtugnutz> Yahtzee wrote a book about jam that ate people.
[4:06:25] <+HappiestFace> it's simple truly
[4:06:33] <+RootShaman> So you already did all the other shit? LUL
[4:06:39] <%AncelDeLambert> somehow this is on the up and up, don't ask me how
[4:06:41] <%rumtumtugnutz> I know of him from that and have never experienced Zero Punctuation
[4:06:56] <%rumtumtugnutz> Other than a game about hats or something
[4:06:59] <%King_Wolf_Rigger> Jam is tasty.
[4:07:00] <%RiceeFTW> lehver or leever
[4:07:01] <%AncelDeLambert> I need to read Jam
[4:07:01] <dekkitout> I appreciate his sardonic candor
[4:07:23] <%King_Wolf_Rigger> @RiceeFTW a little of column A, a little of column B.
[4:07:28] <%Kilagn> Kilagn subscribed at Tier 1. They've subscribed for 10 months! Pushed out the stream baby yesterday...it came out with a gamecube controller and a copy of melee..Im sorry but I gotta throw it in the dumpster, for both of us.
[4:07:52] <%roundaboutrevengeance> @rumtumtugnutz Is he a better writer than a reviewer, legitimately curious, I'm out of good reads
[4:07:56] <%AncelDeLambert> BAHBY
[4:08:30] <%AncelDeLambert> booo, threaten him
[4:08:35] <%AncelDeLambert> oh, he says the same thing
[4:08:39] <Zaphire_Saucypants> man you did this so fuckin quick
[4:08:39] <%rumtumtugnutz> @roundaboutrevengeance I mean, his book is weird. I haven't read it in a number of years, but I do remember that it was odd.
[4:08:58] <VigilantShield> well then
[4:09:02] <dekkitout> Oh ship
[4:09:04] <%AncelDeLambert> and here is where I left off last time I played

[4:09:14] <%honeyman18> Boomy Boom
[4:09:15] <@lewdskeletor13> cryMonka cryMonka cryMonka cryMonka
[4:09:15] <%AncelDeLambert> Yeah, Pat, I don't think you're finishing this planet for at least an hour
[4:09:16] <42nfl19> IS THAT THE PLOT COMING IN?
[4:09:18] <%derap41> hope you didn't cause that
[4:09:31] <%rumtumtugnutz> He could finish in less than an hour.
[4:09:46] <%rumtumtugnutz> But it would mean ignoring some side quests
[4:09:55] <mankeyfigh> He’s doing all the side quests
[4:10:01] <%miguelrod777> LUL
[4:10:10] <%rumtumtugnutz> Which you can probably still do after anyway, honestly. I dunno.
[4:10:23] <+griffball13> FUCK YOU GRAHAM
[4:10:24] <+RootShaman> I think he could do it in 1 more stream
[4:10:38] <Zaphire_Saucypants> talk to Sanjar first.
[4:10:39] <%rumtumtugnutz> Things got kinda murdery for me after here.
[4:10:42] <Futurecity10> Well, thats the end of this stream
[4:10:57] <CursedNobleman> Sanjar > Graham
[4:11:03] <Monkeyweed21> science\
[4:11:03] <@Moobot> Hey, if you guys feel like checking out The Outer Worlds on account of this stream or cause you think I'm cool, go ahead and use this link https://bit.ly/2JmpB3Q to grab it off Greenman Gaming, and I'll get a few bucks kicked back. Thanks!
[4:11:09] <%King_Wolf_Rigger> Graham has repeatedly shown himself not worthy of that fine vessal.
[4:11:10] <hntronium> Holy shit pat why are you still going
[4:11:11] <%AncelDeLambert> fuck Graham, weasel fuck
[4:11:13] <+drawdehellfire> The space dilation one where you move at normal speed
[4:11:18] <%rumtumtugnutz> I think he could finish the game in one more stream., but it depends on how things proceed.
[4:11:20] <CursedNobleman> @rumtumtugnutz "kinda murdery" LUL
[4:11:40] <Zaphire_Saucypants> talk to the factions first before you pick it up, is something I'd advise.
[4:11:40] <breakerdsx> We Science Build now bois
[4:11:42] <%rumtumtugnutz> @CursedNobleman I stand by what I said.
[4:11:50] <YourStepdadsBrother> LUL

[4:12:14] <breakerdsx> BibleThump BibleThump BibleThump
[4:12:17] <+RootShaman> there was probably like 20 minutes left of that planet
[4:12:19] <%King_Wolf_Rigger> Monarch seems like a big zone.
[4:12:23] <DesuDesuDokiDoki> sleepy pat
[4:12:26] <allanmiri> It should take less than an hour next time give or take.
[4:12:29] <CursedNobleman> @drawdehellfire whut?
[4:12:32] <Futurecity10> Pat, I'm doing pvp for this void blasted gear. I fucking have pvp so fucking much
[4:12:35] <+JacktheMan18> Guess you need to do that 24hr stream to finish the game then
[4:12:43] <Dakuu75> <3
[4:12:49] <Futurecity10> @AngriestPat No, FF14
[4:12:53] <@lewdskeletor13> We love Emlo
[4:12:55] <%rumtumtugnutz> @CursedNobleman There were some incidents that resulted in my killing people on both sides, because I forgot that friendly fire doesn't extend to NPCs.
[4:12:55] <Futurecity10> FF14 pvp sucks cock
[4:12:56] <+drawdehellfire> @CursedNobleman I fucking poured coffee in my cup noodles instead of hot water like an idiot
[4:12:57] <%King_Wolf_Rigger> @drawdehellfire I'm sorry, shrimp coffee ramen?
[4:13:11] <Futurecity10> I'm not gay so I dont play Destiny
[4:13:14] <%King_Wolf_Rigger> OH, that explains it
[4:13:23] <%rumtumtugnutz> Monarch is the biggest zone in the game
[4:13:27] <MasterDecoder> @Futurecity10 R00d
[4:13:28] <Dakuu75> when did FF14 get a New Game+ btw? That guy raided was doing it last night
[4:13:30] <CursedNobleman> @rumtumtugnutz Oopsie! LUL @drawdehellfire DansGame
[4:13:50] <Zaphire_Saucypants> I was kinda disappointed by Scylla. Wasn't much to do there.

[4:14:09] <Futurecity10> Congratz, you dont sucks bunji's dick

[4:14:21] <@lewdskeletor13> Nobody has any proof the schedule changed
[4:14:26] <%honeyman18> I wanted to steal the terraformer off scylla or something, but nope. Just moon apes.
[4:14:28] <@lewdskeletor13> It was always like that
[4:14:31] <%rumtumtugnutz> Someone sent a picture of your junk, huh?
[4:14:35] <%Run44forrest> More Swords PogChamp
[4:14:41] <Hidashi13> bungie

[4:15:11] <Futurecity10> You forget they allied with them in the first place
[4:15:16] <%King_Wolf_Rigger> I was legit thinking of Bunji Kugashira from Gungrave.
[4:15:21] <%Kilagn> Buttons PogChamp
[4:15:24] <Futurecity10> But before that they sold Halo to incompetent fuck ups
[4:15:31] <@lewdskeletor13> Elmo a good armrest

[4:15:54] <%rumtumtugnutz> I still can;t believe the head of Xbox Game Studios is named Matt Booty.
[4:16:05] <%Kilagn> Funky Fetus PogChamp
[4:16:10] <%rumtumtugnutz> Norman Reedus and the BABYFUNK
[4:16:14] <%honeyman18> Baby is cool.

[4:16:37] <Futurecity10> someones already streaming the game
[4:16:43] <Hidashi13> death stranding is going to have a pc port right?
[4:16:49] <@lewdskeletor13> Yes
[4:16:52] <%Run44forrest> Death Stranding but elmos the baby
[4:16:56] <%honeyman18> The Artificial womb doesn't get enough credit for being weird and nest as fuck.
[4:17:10] <Dakuu75> Toad or Peach
[4:17:20] <%rumtumtugnutz> Of the Mario characters? Luigi for sure.
[4:17:22] <Hidashi13> gotta eat the baby
[4:17:24] <pi_in_the_sci> Truth
[4:17:27] <%lotharrio> WaLuigi
[4:17:31] <%rumtumtugnutz> Luigi is probably racist.
[4:17:37] <%Run44forrest> Wario
[4:17:38] <%rumtumtugnutz> Waluigi is cool
[4:17:40] <@lewdskeletor13> Wario would commit a hate crime for money
[4:17:41] <a_mad_dragon> goombas are just a minority group of toad
[4:17:45] <Nina96> no pat is the baby and elmo is Norman Reedus
[4:17:46] <+fingalights> Gooigi
[4:17:56] <Futurecity10> sbfpPat
[4:18:01] <%rumtumtugnutz> Wario is just Upside Down Mario
[4:18:06] <%Run44forrest> Wario has big boomer energy
[4:18:12] <%King_Wolf_Rigger> @lewdskeletor13 I would do many things for money
[4:18:14] <@lewdskeletor13> My second playthrough was killing everyone. Game becomes super short
[4:18:16] <Hidashi13> the koopa kids
[4:18:31] <Nina96> Wario is boomer energy given form
[4:18:33] <allanmiri> Outer Worlds gives me hope for the future.
