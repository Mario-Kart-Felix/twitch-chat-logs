[0:21:47] <+griffball13> @AngriestPat what happens if you drink all 5
[0:21:50] <%Jack_of_No_Trades> I wish he crushed it on his head and gave a big Rick Flair WOOO when you do 3
[0:21:51] <+freakintony> Skip cutscene while drinking
[0:21:53] <%fuzzycracker> How did he get Monster back? Once I got the porter I thought it was permanent
[0:21:53] <Demon_chann> so tried monster it was okay but then i tried zero and holy shit is way better
[0:21:54] <+Ilpala> How could you cheat on Red Bull-senpai like this

[0:21:59] <%Valdorick> Gotta stay on Brand.
[0:22:02] <+Edrem> The game tracks total "water" consumed
[0:22:03] <+luketrapwalker> Drinking Monster with your shades on makes you even faster.
[0:22:03] <ChoculaUltra> whats the ironic part tho
[0:22:03] <%rumtumtugnutz> And PEER PRESSURE
[0:22:03] <PROUD2beGINGER> "Irony"
[0:22:05] <UchiVsTheWorld> wow so ironic

[0:22:12] <%Engwithan_Elder_God> You die from a heart attack?
[0:22:13] <%Strider222> then you drink all five
[0:22:13] <%Meow0369> nothing
[0:22:14] <%valriot> Look at BB
[0:22:14] <+griffball13> He should die
[0:22:15] <mrblack499> how is he not dead?
[0:22:18] <ElenaManetta> jesus christ i can feel the heart attack
[0:22:18] <%rumtumtugnutz> We peer pressured Pat into consuming the product
[0:22:18] <%Valdorick> Instant Heartattack.
[0:22:19] <%StaceMcGate> and now Norman has a heart rate of 220 bpm
[0:22:19] <artificiallynatural> heartman dies all the time because of the monster he drinks
[0:22:20] <katocrimson> I'm drinking this ironically
[0:22:22] <cx_c2> he loves it
[0:22:23] <ElenaManetta> this is making me sick
[0:22:25] <$rytyoung> it makes me need to piss watching him down 5 cans in a row
[0:22:25] <+griffball13> booooo

[0:22:26] <%Meow0369> but you realistically should have severe heart palpitations
[0:22:29] <ThatOneGuyYouSaw> @AngriestPat literally nothing happens

[0:22:41] <%Flambage> @AngriestPat You now have diabetes
[0:22:45] <PROUD2beGINGER> I think drinking that much of any liquid would make you sick
[0:22:45] <%rumtumtugnutz> Eat that cryptocurrency
[0:22:45] <@lewdskeletor13> I wish you would actually die if you drank all of them
[0:22:45] <%Laecerelius> A bug a day makes your poop anti-BT!

[0:29:41] <lyzejag> Léa Seydoux is very french yes
[0:29:41] <+PirateMike_> No one ever dropped a nuclear bomb off a bike so you're safe
[0:29:42] <Calek> she also has a french accent

[0:29:54] <@lewdskeletor13> One guy
[0:29:57] <Demon_chann> shes also very cute
[0:29:59] <mayorrev> @AngriestPat he said the AoE, which i assume is the bomb's AoE
[0:29:59] <+paladinstarbuster> Go throw it in that tar lake
[0:29:59] <%GalacticaPhanto> I mean take it to the crater?
[0:29:59] <@lewdskeletor13> It’s always one guy
[0:30:01] <Badgerconda_> MERDE!
[0:30:03] <TheSandmanIsHere> the egg is Sam's testicle
[0:30:04] <tigerfang86> ONE GUY
[0:30:06] <SpaceGuntank> whats the countdown timer on the bomb?
[0:30:06] <%audrus> i found the egg on screen its in the lower left corner!
[0:30:07] <Rosy_Joan> her name is Lea Seydoux shes clearly Chinese.
[0:30:07] <Skatedeandre> What is that one guy talking about
[0:30:09] <lyzejag> PUTAIN
[0:30:13] <tigerfang86> fuckin one guy
[0:30:13] <%Ner234> Also Pat, your stupid Twitter introduced me to that Cursed Cartoon account. I can't get it out of my head.
[0:30:13] <Mendin> Does anyone remember when Revolver Ocelot hit a bomb in Snake's shit after he got out of jail?
[0:30:14] <ThatOneGuyYouSaw> @StaceMcGate NOT SO FAST
[0:30:14] <%Divryne> Pat I dare you to take it to South Knot first.
[0:30:15] <+dante_must_die_exe> WAIT so souldn't Timefall just fuck that bomb up?
[0:30:18] <%StaceMcGate> Why is there a French Woman in post apocalypse America @AngriestPat
[0:30:18] <Mendin> This is basically that, again
[0:30:26] <%Doomcoder> maybe if you take a bath in the hot springs, there will be a special cutscene where the bomb gets out of the case and goes for a relaxing soak
[0:30:32] <Angry_Ev1L> @AngriestPat did you see they announced new half life for VR?
[0:30:33] <+PirateMike_> Whos one guy
[0:30:35] <KasiCrafter> It either messes the bomb up or makes it INSTANTLY explode.
[0:30:40] <DSD24> @dante_must_die_exe The container still has the timefall resistance box on it
[0:30:44] <Calek> @Mendin remember that was at least the second time that's happened to him?
[0:30:48] <ZComiX> timefall would effect tge COTNAINER not the cargo
[0:30:50] <Nina96> what about the bomb?
[0:30:52] <%trashcansan> keep on keeping on
[0:30:52] <%bevyrage> whoever parked that truck is an asshole
[0:30:54] <+dante_must_die_exe> @DSD24 that's dumb bullshit
[0:30:55] <%honeyman18> big sleep

[0:55:55] <%Meow0369> the skin is aged but the body underneath is fine
[0:55:55] <BlueSpartan119> as soon as it hits something it turns into normal water
[0:55:57] <ShichiNoBushi> His hair greyed instantly, also.
[0:55:57] <grayjammer> Kohimbo is a GENIUS

[0:55:59] <Pnutz409> anti boomer
[0:56:00] <SoySocks> if your skin is wet from the rain, does the rain that hits that spot get aged again?
[0:56:00] <katocrimson> Norman and Fragile are Doomers

[0:56:03] <$BoundlessBroadcast> I see Crazy Talk has activated
[0:56:04] <$FluffiTamamo> The longer she stays in the rain, the more games she thinks are t as good as DOOM.
[0:56:04] <%Doomcoder> Higgs made it rain only like 10% timefall
[0:56:04] <%Jack_of_No_Trades> Just skin

[0:56:06] <%honeyman18> The guy in the opening cutscene died In like 30 seconds
[0:56:06] <+junks2300> Does it age her insides too? Or just her skin?
[0:56:07] <%goose_attack_almanac> No but Pat. Her boobs were so phenom it took 100 years of rain to granny her up
[0:56:08] <transporterthesequel> IM NO HERO

[0:56:11] <+jay521> how does she still have such a great ass
[0:56:12] <%xtremegamer80> I'm pretty sure it's just the skin cells being aged
[0:56:12] <Zaphire_Saucypants> tight granny pants.
[0:56:13] <haisho> took him a good while to age
[0:56:13] <DatHatBoy> then they'd never be able to farm crops
[0:56:13] <%Valdorick> So he's being Kojima!
[0:56:14] <faldin> just her skin
[0:56:15] <%GeneralSCPatton> Don't cryptobiotes give resistance to timefall?
[0:56:15] <AlwaysBeGaming> old body
[0:56:16] <RoldanDgr8> well the truck driver was alive for several seconds
[0:56:17] <atomicdestruction> Does timefall's effect stack?

[0:56:31] <+DesertPenguin> whoa
[0:56:34] <%floralkami> @honeyman18 no, the guy died after like 5 minutes by gunshot
[0:56:35] <Zaphire_Saucypants> the most conforming of granny pants to give the ILLUSION of firm ass.

[0:57:06] <Ion_Laser> Ma'am. I deliver packages
[0:57:06] <+ArmoredTeeth> S RANK HIGGS
[0:57:07] <Mister_McDerp> DELIVER BULLETS TO HIS BODY
[0:57:08] <%JustToWatch> Pat you literally can't die
[0:57:09] <ThDark> Sam is a Repatriat, Fragile is not, he has an edge
[0:57:09] <%logoth_> W r i t i n g !
[0:57:09] <Demon_chann> the power of STRAND
[0:57:09] <$vincerocmm> how hes big strong thats how
[0:57:10] <%XeroSigmaPrime> He's a Reptriate, he's basically invincible
[0:57:10] <%mostly_simple> I'm just a mailman
[0:57:10] <Angry_Ev1L> DELIVER HIM TO DEATH
[0:57:10] <%J_Papa> This game out the day before my birthday, Mads wished me a Happy Birthday in the BB memory and there was a cake on the table
[0:57:11] <LORDSPOOKLEKINS> LUL
[0:57:12] <$spardanwarrior> With the power of your funky fetus of course!
[0:57:12] <Pnutz409> wait who is Higgs? im only on ch 2 lol
[0:57:12] <transporterthesequel> He got DEAD PUSS
[0:57:13] <NotHereToStream> i fed up with this worl
[0:57:13] <%SomeSageAdvice> its because he's a repatriate right? or is Fragile is also a repatriate?
[0:57:14] <%Doomcoder> so it seems like the deal is that you can only bring things with you onto the beach if they matter to you or are an important part of your identity or something. I would argue that if someone gave you a nuke, that would matter to you
