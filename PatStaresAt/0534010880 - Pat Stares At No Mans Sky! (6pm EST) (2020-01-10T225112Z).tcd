[0:12:29] <%SilverFaustX> theres a bug in iceborne that deletes savefiles
[0:12:30] <Angry_Ev1L> you are an internet meme
[0:12:33] <zamzoph> I love when Internet Historian talked about Shia Lebouf's HWNDU

[0:12:50] <Enemy_In_Disguise> HWNDU is a fantastic series

[0:12:51] <RedoctoberWolf> pretty even to me
[0:12:53] <%michingmallecho> apatJpeg
[0:12:57] <Mccoyster365> Even the games you know about are badly researched.
[0:12:57] <%walternatorz> you mean you research?..
[0:12:59] <FalseEyeD> If anything, Pat is fully self-aware
[0:13:00] <Angry_Ev1L> you are his research subject LUL

[0:13:10] <+Nomicro4u> research is for nerds

[0:13:12] <%dekkitout> It's like poetry it rhymes

[0:13:20] <%Cykron> Perfect rivals
[0:13:22] <zamzoph> @Enemy_In_Disguise I watched that actual stream LUL
[0:13:23] <%MidnightBurst12> research is for cowards

[0:13:30] <%zafooru> i cant believe that pat, the man who is known for being supernaturally wrong, doesn't research everything
[0:13:31] <%SummonerMagno> cue internet historian making an indivisible video and Pat being like "maybe i should play that again"
[0:13:34] <+spiegspikel> Research is for smart people.
[0:13:38] <%Razputin217> Research is for NERDS
[0:13:44] <%AncelDeLambert> the most fascinating thing was the lead dev LEARNING FROM HIS DUMB MISTAKES
[0:13:46] <%GarbageNirvana> oof
[0:13:46] <+Nomicro4u> No refund's sky
[0:13:52] <%Dementedpenguin> The part where he used the criticism and turned it into statistics.
[0:13:52] <+Nomicro4u> No Man's refund
[0:13:55] <%vaporousTippler> Yeaaaah, totally different game now.
[0:13:55] <+AllenDeadman> it was

[0:13:56] <samuel1ful> when's RE3 Pat!?
[0:13:59] <%Dementedpenguin> *was incredible
[0:13:59] <%SlashHabit> start of the game hasn't changed much though
[0:14:01] <Mccoyster365> This sounds like a situation similar to Warframe and how that game launched.
[0:14:04] <+Spec7re> The fact that a studio actually cared enough about its IP to fix it and make it god is so foreign
[0:14:05] <rekkn91> this is gonna be fun. never played the game, saw the video though
[0:14:08] <Enemy_In_Disguise> More like Dumb Man’s Sky
[0:14:12] <+spiegspikel> It was
[0:14:17] <zamzoph> Is it still the same ending?
[0:14:18] <JDebss> IMO the gameplay is still the same and boring
[0:14:18] <%Jekado> its like another game i bet for people who played this on day 1

[0:33:41] <Demon_chann> it was
[0:33:44] <%valriot> We're allergic to your bitchin, gottem
[0:34:02] <Demon_chann> why would you left a bloody skull in a robot
[0:34:04] <%Darren716> Like I'm not allergic to do anything, and that's because i chose not to be allergic. Why doesnt everyone do that?
[0:34:11] <%ClaudeMcGarren> its super dumb
[0:34:14] <%ClaudeMcGarren> i love it
[0:34:18] <%MisterTylerrr> Do they call him Robocop 2?
[0:34:19] <%Coystick> You should watch Robocop 2 with that weird cat that's behind you
[0:34:22] <%fruit_pie_the_magician> I was watching some stream with what I think was a swedish guy who spoke no english and who had his cam replaced by a 3d mapped velociraptor that was scanning his movements and lip synching to him in real time
[0:34:26] <zamzoph> I'm surprised that one scene is in the Robocop remake for a PG-13 movie
[0:34:36] <King_Wolf_Rigger> gotta get the SeX
[0:34:41] <Mccoyster365> Porque no los dos?
[0:34:48] <derap41> a what?
[0:34:49] <+primax104> that's strong
[0:34:49] <DrFaustMD> because I'm a broke bitch
[0:34:58] <Enemy_In_Disguise> Xbox SeX
[0:34:58] <+primax104> someone trademark that term
[0:35:00] <%Cykron> PS5 is necessary for more Final Fantasy
[0:35:03] <+Remery_> depends on which has more JRPG's
[0:35:06] <+primax104> Let's Playstation
[0:35:09] <%MisterTylerrr> You telling me you don't LOVE HDCP?
[0:35:12] <$FluffiTamamo> He’s touching this refurbished dumpster fire?
[0:35:17] <+2DSuperiority> THE Station
[0:35:17] <star_feline> just get a framemeister 4Head
[0:35:18] <%Ranryu692> the only Kojima games I've ever beaten are the Boktai games and Ground Zeroes
[0:35:21] <Ultimatefool> Can you not stream with HDMI cables?
[0:35:26] <%13ry4n93> daily reminder that teh PS4 had a working PS2 emulator on it since launch but was never unlocked/activated by Sony because screw you

[0:35:40] <%Coystick> Playsstation is just a cool brand, Xbox was almost cool 360 era
[0:35:44] <%Darren716> That takes literally 30 minutes
[0:35:56] <twigmandem> quick do a dab
[0:35:57] <sakeydo> backwards compatibility, will that set anarchy reigns free?
[0:35:59] <Mccoyster365> I really wonder how Sony are going to handle backwards compatibility with doanloadable titles. My PS4 library is split between physical and downloaded. I hope my store purchases for PS4 games carry over to the PS5.
[0:36:02] <cureneckbeard> Pat why would you throw equipment away? What if you need it later?

[0:40:55] <Ultimatefool> Chat, is this game good now?
[0:41:00] <%rumtumtugnutz> Don't Permadeath, it's a trick
[0:41:01] <%valriot> Select your Vibe
[0:41:02] <Enemy_In_Disguise> Are the planets more than just palette swaps now?
[0:41:02] <star_feline> PERMADEATH OR COWARD
[0:41:03] <Darkrenai> Or people who wanna build stuff
[0:41:03] <+ZoltanBMagnus> it literally is space minecraft
[0:41:05] <+isitaspider> Go the coward route
[0:41:06] <artificiallynatural> But Pat, you're a coward
[0:41:06] <icecreamwave> Permadeath is more realistic
[0:41:06] <+ianabstract> Normal is good
[0:41:08] <try_it_sis_> CREATIVE
[0:41:08] <sakeydo> Pat you become immortal but you're never allowed to kill a spider again.
[0:41:08] <%Coystick> For autists
[0:41:08] <%fruit_pie_the_magician> CREATIVE IS FUN SHIT
[0:41:08] <$Ziegsy> permadeath shouldnt be a thing in a game that can spawn you on a lethal planet
[0:41:09] <$Kenzo2000> Stream ends on permdeatg
[0:41:09] <+Spec7re> Confirmed coward
[0:41:10] <%dekkitout> Creative is for artists

[0:41:20] <%QueequegTheater> @AngriestPat Pat if you ever feel like getting into Subnautica again, creative mode in that game gets rid of all bars
[0:41:23] <%zafooru> Why do video games use wacky difficulty names. There's normal, obviously the next one should be hard, right? And the last one should be easy?
[0:41:24] <Mccoyster365> Creative is for "artists" with "integrity and shit".
[0:41:24] <RamenRiderZ> Hi Pat, didn't know Starfield was out :)
[0:41:26] <%valriot> "Looks" uh huh
[0:41:27] <%rumtumtugnutz> @Ultimatefool It's fun. It's maybe still not a great game, but I had a lot of fun with it.

[0:43:00] <%GeneralSCPatton> @zafooru Those terms have very specific meanings. Creative removes all damage/death mechanics and gives infinite resources. Survival adds more mechanics you have to manage.

[0:47:38] <%crimsonharvest> you got an objective there too dont ignore the words
[0:47:40] <+kralec> I watched the internet historians video on this game yesterday. Then pat is playing it. There are too many coincidences in my life. rooDerp
[0:47:41] <DSD24> I like 3rd person
[0:47:43] <%zafooru> quick boot up a smash tournament to get sufficient sodium
[0:47:44] <iamnuff> rub salt on yourself to protect you from the sun, and make yourself delicious.
[0:47:52] <stevo_scar> No Man's Sky, surprised

[0:48:27] <%zafooru> haha dumb plant, didn't even dodge the laser
[0:48:30] <sonicblade38> wait wtf is that is 99% of this game lol
[0:48:34] <%snow_bush> snow_bush subscribed at Tier 1. They've subscribed for 13 months! So Pat, I heard you like Long Pig.
[0:48:34] <+ZoltanBMagnus> pat gonna die from sun poisoning
[0:48:35] <JesusFromSpace> AngelThump
[0:48:36] <+Remery_> The Sun hates your opinions!
[0:48:43] <%QueequegTheater> Kill the sun
[0:48:43] <NaturalGear> PJSalt x13
[0:48:46] <%Nina96> how much is this right now?
[0:49:00] <+amiroodude> Is this a Strand genre of game?
[0:49:00] <%SlashHabit> if you do the following. Sprint+Melee+Hold jump/jetpack you get a massive boost to your momentum. Might take a couple of tries.
[0:49:01] <%snow_bush> The sun is the light of your day.
[0:49:02] <%zafooru> its an AAALIEN
[0:49:03] <%Coystick> Come back
[0:49:06] <%PerrinIsDead> Is the music kinda loud for anyone else?
[0:49:07] <King_Wolf_Rigger> The sun owes three months of alimony.
[0:49:08] <%QueequegTheater> ALIENS
[0:49:12] <JDebss> is it?
[0:49:13] <+ZoltanBMagnus> music is fine for me
[0:49:13] <%SoFarFetched> @Nina96 $60
[0:49:18] <Deekman> GO SEE PLANT MONSTER
[0:49:18] <fairore> we dont mind if you want in 1st person
[0:49:18] <%snow_bush> HERETICS
[0:49:19] <+OnyxOblivion> if you cancel your sprint with a melee attack and jump, you can go FLYING
[0:49:20] <icecreamwave> wut if the aliens are sexy?
[0:49:20] <%Nina96> for real?
[0:49:21] <Deekman> RIGHT
[0:49:23] <%PrettyThickandStrongDyck> It actually almost looks like how it was advertaised
[0:49:24] <%QueequegTheater> Pat grab more PJSalt
[0:49:24] <%SoFarFetched> Yeah
[0:49:26] <%rumtumtugnutz> Oh yeah. You can buy their ships, too. Or find crashed ones that give you better ships.
[0:49:29] <%TheQButton> Life other then your own? Yeah I'd say that's better then the last time!
[0:49:30] <fairore> @sofarfetched on PC?
[0:49:33] <%SoFarFetched> yes
[0:49:34] <Klarrann3> can you still do the sprint jump? or did they patch that out?
[0:49:37] <%UltraViolet371> you get a way better sense of scale with 3rd person
[0:49:38] <%zafooru> quantum?
[0:49:40] <worldbrand> a tiny one?
[0:49:42] <%SoFarFetched> PC on Steam
[0:49:42] <nomos42> So tiny?
[0:49:43] <%Ranryu692> I don't think that word means what you think it means
[0:49:45] <+RSNoon> small improvement
[0:49:48] <%Coystick> Don't forget to soothe your BB
[0:49:49] <FstSergeant8595> everything has been the same so far
[0:49:49] <Deekman> it's only good while you're looking at it?
[0:49:53] <xanderfist> I love the music
[0:49:53] <%MoulesFritz> pat keeps says it's imporved but it looks exactly the same to me
[0:49:53] <%Ranryu692> Geode is a cool dude
[0:49:54] <icecreamwave> its a rock pokemon very old gen
[0:49:56] <ShichiNoBushi> Anal-yze
[0:49:58] <nomos42> Yeah the melee boost jump saves time
[0:49:59] <NaturalGear> gedoude's first evolution
[0:50:00] <%genowyn> Quantum means small pat
[0:50:00] <JDebss> what has improved other than 3rd person?
[0:50:02] <star_feline> Quantum sized improvements
[0:50:02] <foreverN2dust> the barnacles on the ground bother me
[0:50:04] <sonicblade38> does he know about the melee boost jump?
[0:50:07] <%QueequegTheater> those cows are cool boys tho
[0:50:09] <JesusFromSpace> No Man's Stranding
[0:50:09] <Sain0127> music a bit loud
[0:50:10] <%chiluzza> so how many roads are gonna be built here
[0:50:11] <+kralec> @AngriestPat well if the internet historian's video is accurate, Hello Games basically never stopped working on the game since it's launch. It's been 4 years worth of work. rooThink
[0:50:11] <zamzoph> Quantum is big for Pat Kappa
[0:50:12] <Punisher7771> it only took them 4 years
[0:50:15] <Saltmeisterr> theres a bunch of other stuff later on
[0:50:17] <Demon_chann> game is a bit loud
[0:50:18] <King_Wolf_Rigger> @Deekman Or it is worse when you look at it lol
[0:50:20] <%thegreenbenis> @AngriestPat This music is very Eve Online sounding, I quite like it.
[0:50:20] <rytisone> where's the alien babes at?
[0:50:26] <Fluxraw> fuck this planet, time for some littering
[0:50:27] <star_feline> jesus, 4 years
[0:50:28] <%MoulesFritz> no
[0:50:29] <%dalmek> no
[0:50:29] <icecreamwave> Those are for lightsabers right?
[0:50:30] <Deekman> @King_Wolf_Rigger it's quantum!
[0:50:30] <%QueequegTheater> No
[0:50:30] <+ZoltanBMagnus> no
[0:50:31] <%xcompleasedad> NO
[0:50:31] <trianglehat> you mean hydrogen
[0:50:32] <foreverN2dust> no
[0:50:32] <coracor> it isn't
[0:50:32] <%LittleBigQuebec> no
[0:50:33] <derap41> no ICE
[0:50:33] <Demon_chann> no
[0:50:34] <%zafooru> wheres the oxygen tho
[0:50:34] <zamzoph> That's Dihydrogen monoxide
[0:50:35] <Demon_chann> wtf
[0:50:35] <+Roundelay11> no?
[0:50:38] <%chiluzza> Dihydrgoen is H2 you boomer
[0:50:38] <%xcompleasedad> NO FUCKING OXYGEN YOU FOOL
[0:50:38] <CoffeeSlice> jfc
[0:50:39] <%Mr_Pylon> no
[0:50:40] <+l3sovikk> DIHYDROGEN MONOXIDE!
[0:50:41] <%dalmek> Dihydrogen MONOXIDE is water
[0:50:42] <%Ranryu692> no oxygen, Pat, so not water
[0:50:42] <%nofestu2> no
[0:50:42] <King_Wolf_Rigger> No Pat, you need oxygen for water
[0:50:43] <ShichiNoBushi> Diydrogen is just elemental hydrogen.
[0:50:43] <%QueequegTheater> @AngriestPat those crystals are oxidized you silly man
[0:50:45] <+RSNoon> pat is a chemistry genius
[0:50:45] <%GeneralSCPatton> No, it's H2
[0:50:46] <%bevyrage> pat you're dumb thinking that's water
[0:50:46] <%dekkitout> I see chemistry was not your strongest...
[0:50:50] <+kralec> di-hydrogen MONOXIDE.. It's Hydrogen crystals.
[0:50:51] <+Double_Tap_That> Wouldn't a quantum improvement suggest that the improvements are infinitesimally small?
[0:50:52] <Jaller101514> You spawned on the Aussie planet
[0:50:54] <BluBox> Skyrim that mountain
[0:50:55] <%michingmallecho> apatWrong apatWrong apatWrong
[0:50:57] <%rumtumtugnutz> H2OH NO
[0:50:59] <%Coystick> They add Lakes & RIvers yet?
[0:51:02] <$Dreadlord134> Precious water
[0:51:05] <+amiroodude> Game has its own periodic table
[0:51:08] <%AncelDeLambert> heavy water?
[0:51:09] <%zafooru> always spay and deuter your alien dogs everyone
[0:51:11] <iamnuff> >Tyranny of the Sun
[0:51:12] <cureneckbeard> Deuterium? so water?
[0:51:16] <xanderfist> omg all the chemistry
[0:51:18] <%dekkitout> Heavy hydrogen isotopes bois
[0:51:21] <%Jekado> jet packs this is a woolie seller
[0:51:23] <%michingmallecho> Alright scienc e
[0:51:28] <$Dreadlord134> Precious Antique water
[0:51:28] <%lordjaggerell> now im getting drunk and cooking
[0:51:29] <foreverN2dust> what is with the range on them
[0:51:30] <King_Wolf_Rigger> the hitboxes on those plants are bs
[0:51:31] <%AncelDeLambert> @Double_Tap_That more that the improvements are of a granular nature, to be hyper specific
[0:51:35] <iamnuff> Pat isn't worried about the sun constantly trying to murder him, because he's already a ginger.
[0:51:37] <ShichiNoBushi> Many plants ARE jerks.
[0:51:38] <%SoFarFetched> He's here to beep boops and boop beeps.
[0:51:38] <JDebss> that's how it used to be too though
[0:51:39] <%bevyrage> @Double_Tap_That nah a quantum improvement is a change that is unknown if it had an effect or not until observed, and likely is inconsistent between multiple observations
[0:51:40] <Darkrenai> Lets watch some clouds
[0:51:41] <astrophizz> volumetric
[0:51:41] <%Nina96> fast
[0:51:42] <%thegreenbenis> This is really fucking pretty.
[0:51:43] <CoffeeSlice> bepis
[0:51:44] <Demon_chann> they look good
[0:51:45] <derap41> Don't fuck with Deuterium that shit makes hydogenbombs
[0:51:45] <Deekman> MGSV did it better
[0:51:46] <%zafooru> thaaaats a cloud alright
[0:51:47] <maybefalco> c l o u d t e c h
[0:51:47] <King_Kth> That cloud looks like an oven mit
[0:51:47] <foreverN2dust> clumbos
[0:51:47] <bestwaifuritsu> The clouds look...procedurally generated
[0:51:48] <Dexiro> Was there an update recently or somethin?
[0:51:48] <zamzoph> It's only a model
[0:51:49] <Fluxraw> isnt that water tho
[0:51:51] <+amiroodude> Visuals are so much better than release
[0:51:51] <%MoulesFritz> THE SUN. THE SUN. THE SUN. THE SUN. THE SUN. THE SUN. THE SUN. THE SUN. THE SUN.
[0:51:51] <+kralec> They really fleshed out the game since launch. Good on Hello Games.
[0:51:51] <$Kenzo2000> Yep, it’s a cloud
[0:51:51] <star_feline> You guys ever just beep beep beep boop boop?
[0:51:52] <%QueequegTheater> @AngriestPat Imagine if the game had shipped like this
[0:51:52] <%Engwithan_Elder_God> Storm a coming.
[0:51:53] <%Kiiper> They're actual models now
[0:51:54] <rytisone> Clouds remind me of FF
[0:51:55] <%dekkitout> See those clouds? They rain molten lead Kappa
[0:51:56] <+jawajedi> @jaller101514 you're not wrong pogonaSad
[0:52:01] <%SoFarFetched> @Dexiro like last month I believe.
[0:52:04] <%SlashHabit> volumetric, biiiiiiiiiiiiiitch
[0:52:04] <%Coystick> Your Oradek just looked at me
[0:52:06] <+Roundelay11> NMS and FFXIV are the greatest redemption stories in vidya
[0:52:08] <Demon_chann> wait is that a storm
[0:52:08] <%MoulesFritz> i don't get it
[0:52:12] <JDebss> no
[0:52:12] <%kyh9> Is this basically proto-Death Stranding?
[0:52:15] <Timurine> You wish
[0:52:15] <%QueequegTheater> I don't think so
[0:52:16] <%AncelDeLambert> you mean imagine if they had their business plan fleshed out from the start?
[0:52:21] <%MoulesFritz> it's the same with third person
[0:52:21] <+amiroodude> Pretend peoples

[0:53:32] <Drivershaft> HE LITERALLY RUNS ON SALT

[0:53:44] <trianglehat> oxygen enthusieast?
[0:53:46] <%UltraViolet371> ehh I could live without it
[0:53:47] <+Double_Tap_That> You already have plenty of sodium tho
[0:53:48] <%BallerSwagBro9k> Oxygen is for cowards
[0:53:48] <%TheQButton> Breathing is pretty ight
[0:53:49] <daisyyyy> @drivershaft so do we?
[0:53:50] <Mccoyster365> I wonder how deep the customisation goes, exactly.
[0:53:52] <+Remery_> pretty overrated honestly
[0:53:56] <JDebss> Can you land on an unexplored planet yet?
[0:53:57] <%dekkitout> Oxygen is for cellular-respiratory pansies
[0:54:00] <star_feline> Any Oxygen Breathers in chat PogChamp
[0:54:06] <ShichiNoBushi> I have a love-hate relationship with oxygen. I need it to live, but it is also slowly killing me.
[0:54:07] <iamnuff> Oxygen addict
[0:54:10] <%zafooru> imagine having to respirate oxygen
[0:54:11] <%Jekado> just oxygen is bad for you tho
[0:54:11] <%suikudo> Do not get addicted to Oxygen!
[0:54:13] <+Jordan276> @JDebss uu can land on any unexplored planet
[0:54:14] <%QueequegTheater> @JDebss He literally just started five minutes ago, he doesn't have a ship yet
[0:54:15] <worldbrand> if you love oxygen so much why do you breathe air with only 21% of it
[0:54:16] <derap41> idk Oxygen fucks so much shit up
[0:54:16] <%Garthunox> That's right Jay!
[0:54:17] <%spiritofmojave> breathing sux
[0:54:18] <King_Wolf_Rigger> Hello fellow oxygen breather @star_feline
[0:54:20] <%Coystick> This looks like it'd be faaaaarking zen in VR
[0:54:22] <+kralec> dig it up! rooREE
[0:54:24] <Mccoyster365> iI breathe pure helium, 365, 24/7
[0:54:25] <derap41> Its slowly killing us all
[0:54:32] <Punisher7771> breathings is for babies
[0:54:32] <icecreamwave> aztec temple in space?
[0:54:33] <%rumtumtugnutz> HEY LOOK you found the MSQ
[0:54:34] <%Storm_Samurai> @spiritofmojave respiration is highly overrated
[0:54:35] <%MelBrooksKA> Barry technology is very POWERFUL
[0:54:41] <+amiroodude> No man sky lore
[0:54:42] <Solidnick18> this looks very different now
[0:54:44] <foreverN2dust> Mahvel?
[0:54:45] <star_feline> @King_Wolf_Rigger Hello fellow 02 stan
[0:54:46] <%QueequegTheater> @AngriestPat Hey look the story
[0:54:49] <JDebss> @Jordan276 they all have stuff on them though so it's not unexplored
[0:54:51] <%dekkitout> @icecreamwave Well Kars had to go somewhere
[0:54:54] <pswayde> The Traveler? Destiny?
[0:54:55] <%zafooru> well
[0:54:55] <+kralec> I remember hearing mention of a story update that was pretty well recieved.
[0:54:56] <rytisone> Pat is about to find prothean beacon
[0:54:57] <Mccoyster365> Everyone on the planet who has ever breathed in oxygen has died.... think about that.
[0:55:01] <%KitkatRai> Oh. Ok.
[0:55:04] <%Storm_Samurai> haha
[0:55:04] <%Engwithan_Elder_God> That'll buff out.

[1:07:40] <DasLoad> Carbon is a shit
[1:07:45] <Mccoyster365> Reminds me of an episode of Breaking Bad where Walter is giving a lesson to his class on carbon.

[1:12:26] <%Jekado> that plant has good normals

[1:12:48] <%dekkitout> Is that a space pyramid in the distance? Those things never bode well...
[1:12:49] <%TheQButton> Give carbon. PepePls

[1:13:13] <+PolarBearPat> let me guess, pat wanted to check this out because of internet historian's video
[1:13:17] <%blastazoid26> The juice of life
[1:13:22] <Mccoyster365> Why has no sci-fi thing ever made a joke candy in world called "Carbon-bons"?
[1:13:35] <%QueequegTheater> @AngriestPat It's basically Space Australia, maybe you'll meet that dude from the Ginyu Force

[1:13:50] <ScreamLord> Silicandy
[1:13:50] <shardlab> I remember when the mining beam was so overpowered you could cut a furrow through the world straight to your ship
[1:13:52] <King_Wolf_Rigger> @Mccoyster365 That's legit. Imma steal that if I ever make a book or some shit.
[1:13:57] <DSD24> This music is nice
[1:14:01] <karl_rex> Space dingo ate me baby sister
[1:14:04] <elspiceweasel> now that weed is legal in canada, they could do bong bongs
[1:14:09] <shardlab> Now it takes far too much power to do it
[1:14:09] <rytisone> but can you build roads and ziplines?
[1:14:10] <sparky77> @AngriestPat if something is purple, you can scan it, if its green, you already scanned it
[1:14:14] <+threamstream> If this turns into a space road build stream I’m gonna lose it
[1:14:20] <shardlab> Yes, you can build roads
[1:14:22] <+threamstream> Space build roadman
[1:14:23] <%FirearmsInstructor> @King_Wolf_Rigger Don't do that.

[1:14:31] <%rumtumtugnutz> That's a big cobalt deposit

[1:16:15] <ScreamLord> Multiplayer supposedly exists now
[1:16:16] <HonestHero> Oh that’s good then! HolidaySanta
[1:16:18] <Drchandragupta> Yo I just joined, is pat enjoying it?

[1:16:31] <Psykoknight65> I tried the VR for this last night, I almost crashed my ship and died 10/10
[1:16:32] <%QueequegTheater> @FirearmsInstructor Internet Historian did a video on it
[1:16:33] <%UltraViolet371> it often puts you into the last used menu
[1:16:39] <sparky77> you can search the red ones too btw
[1:16:41] <Drchandragupta> Nice thanks @DSD24
[1:16:41] <King_Wolf_Rigger> @FirearmsInstructor Internet Historian did a vid
[1:16:46] <+amiroodude> Car-bon
[1:16:48] <MrJackett> The red ones were chests as well
[1:16:58] <%rumtumtugnutz> @FirearmsInstructor Internet Historian made a cool video so now Pat's playing NMS
[1:17:02] <maebold> u missed a tinted chest my dude
[1:17:11] <sonicblade38> they just ammo chests
[1:17:11] <%bevyrage> @FirearmsInstructor also the game is good?
[1:17:23] <+ianabstract> once the ship is repaired, you can summon it to wherever you are, which is a nice quality of life improvement
[1:17:26] <%FirearmsInstructor> @QueequegTheater @King_Wolf_Rigger idk what that even means, but imma ask google now :) @rumtumtugnutz (also you) Thanks for the response. ... @bevyrage YOU TOO! xD
[1:17:35] <scottishwolf> The fact Pat was also moved by Internet Historian's video makes me slightly less weird for being so inspired.
[1:17:45] <%SoFarFetched> think everyone got inspired
[1:17:52] <%dalmek> AGE: PERPETUAL
[1:17:52] <%SoFarFetched> bet it was like the Witcher 3 all over again

[1:18:02] <+l3sovikk> Rename him Crabbo
[1:18:04] <%dekkitout> His friends call him 'Red'
[1:18:10] <%SoFarFetched> with the whole "more people buying No Man's sky now then they did at launch"
[1:18:12] <%Cykron> @scottishwolf It’s just an all around feel good watch. Including the erotic fanfic
[1:18:17] <%FirearmsInstructor> "The Engoodening of No Man's Sky" ? LUL
[1:18:17] <%king_wragles> You can name creatures?
[1:18:20] <PlumpPotatoRump> Can you get weapons to violence the locals with?
[1:18:23] <%UltraViolet371> just steal everything
[1:18:23] <maebold> Glad they did tbh, the devs have put a decent amount of work into recovering from the god awful launch and the game is pretty fun now
[1:18:23] <+Jordan276> @king_wragles yes
[1:18:28] <%messentry> Are the ressources infinite Pat?
[1:18:38] <MrJackett> Don't be picky, mow it all doooowwwnnn
[1:18:40] <%king_wragles> Pat, please rename that creature "Crabo"
[1:18:40] <%Jekado> there is a counter in the corner
[1:18:40] <%QueequegTheater> @messentry no
[1:18:41] <%SoFarFetched> @Cykron bet the erotic gave Sean murray a "feel good" in it LUL
[1:18:44] <DSD24> I love your dinky little blaster
[1:18:49] <beanfriction> eat the crystals
[1:18:53] <+Jordan276> @messentry u will need a shit ton of time to mine all the ressource of a planet
[1:18:54] <%Cykron> @firearmsinstructor It’s my favorite internet historian vid to date
[1:18:56] <%SoFarFetched> heat the crystals
[1:18:56] <Saltmeisterr> i think hello games just wanted tomake a cool game and got to oer there heads

[1:19:30] <%Jekado> chat pat needs all your salt
[1:19:34] <+sunriser696> does pat knows about the punch jump?
[1:19:37] <%FirearmsInstructor> @Cykron hey man. Not sure what happened the other day but did you leave or stop responding? I didn't see a reply and was like "ok well I guess he didn't want a recommendation anymore?" LUL
[1:19:37] <+Jordan276> it is
[1:19:40] <Saltmeisterr> not to mention Sean is a bad PR guy
[1:19:40] <%rumtumtugnutz> Yep
[1:19:40] <beanfriction> just smear all that jelly goo and massage it into the thing
[1:19:44] <King_Wolf_Rigger> @SixthSun2 Don't worry about it, that's normal.
[1:20:00] <%SoFarFetched> @Saltmeisterr that's cause he wasn't really a PR guy.
[1:20:06] <Mccoyster365> Look at yopu, base building.
[1:20:06] <Saltmeisterr> ye
[1:20:06] <%SoFarFetched> and they didn't really have one in general
[1:20:10] <%Cykron> @firearmsinstructor Oh yeah I had to go to work lol. Sorry about that
[1:20:24] <%TheQButton> car bons
[1:20:25] <%rumtumtugnutz> Now you need ferrets

[1:20:44] <%FirearmsInstructor> @Cykron ok yeah I was going to drill down and make the best suggestion I could. I can follow up with you later if you want. I just was like "whelp I think he left?" LUL
[1:20:44] <King_Wolf_Rigger> Man, I love ferrets
[1:20:53] <King_Wolf_Rigger> They are radical little dudes
[1:20:55] <%Jekado> that was fast
[1:21:05] <Mccoyster365> Things fueled by carbon is the future man. Imagine just refueling your car by breathing into a tube for a few minutes.
[1:21:08] <DSD24> Did you pick it up

[1:21:30] <%rumtumtugnutz> But apparently youtube says you need to stop kissing male ferrets on the penis.

[1:38:48] <%Jekado> quality of life changes... in a game?
[1:38:50] <Mccoyster365> It's a shame Shammy said he was done with this game. Kinda hoping he says fuck that and does a review on this now.
[1:38:51] <shardlab> The qol upgrades are nuts after seeing where it came from

[1:38:58] <+Jordan276> even vr mode is free
[1:39:01] <MrJackett> The devs have turned into the masters of QOL improvements

[1:39:22] <$The_Cassowary> Herro Pat and chat

[1:39:35] <Hegataro> Are you playing this because of the Internet Historian video, Pat?
[1:39:37] <%gigglefists> hello Cassowary
[1:39:39] <beanfriction> be careful about the dihydrogen monoxide
[1:39:41] <%Quigsies> good music

[1:40:24] <%coldinnovation> i feel that gigglefists
[1:40:26] <+amiroodude> This feels complicated
[1:40:28] <beanfriction> a cassowary is just a cautious bird.
[1:40:31] <%UltraViolet371> daytime on this moon is so friendly
[1:40:37] <%coldinnovation> im working for a local theater and there is no such thing as a total day off
[1:40:43] <+amiroodude> Is this complicated?
[1:40:51] <Narukamiiii> It feels complicated but its not really
[1:40:52] <Mccoyster365> Oh shit you can go underwater now too, right? We need to find a planet with some fucking water, stat.
[1:40:58] <FrankysDream> pat looks so confused this entire stream
[1:41:00] <The_Cassowary> oh that stinks bud :( Hope it goes quick at least. I may have to work Sunday if we get lots of ice and snow

[1:41:01] <+sunriser696> do right bumper plus jump
[1:41:01] <Darkrenai> Oop
[1:41:03] <Nox_ludicro> Steam handles input for a lot of games
[1:41:06] <+Jordan276> @Mccoyster365 they updated the biomes in the game
[1:41:10] <%gigglefists> lol I'm like of the two people who control the flow of parts for 7 car brands in northern michigan. afraid I cant risk a day off
[1:41:13] <FutaSnek> LUL THANKS STEAM
[1:41:13] <maebold> @AngriestPat If you melee(right bumper probably?) and jetpack at the same time you boost forward
[1:41:30] <Darkrenai> Dab on em
[1:41:37] <+amiroodude> Lolol that looks broken
[1:41:38] <cosmictrashcan> Lol i remember everyone laughing everytime someone said NMS was good now, but after that video it seems like most people finally see it
[1:41:39] <+kralec> Dab them to death. rooREE
[1:41:39] <+Remery_> that's a dab not a punch
[1:41:42] <MrJackett> no its awesome due to boost jump
[1:41:46] <FutaSnek> @AngriestPat Melee while sprinting to go faster, protip
[1:41:47] <+dmtjinni> Do Cotton Hill impression plzzz @AngriestPat
[1:41:51] <PlumpPotatoRump> basically a stringer
[1:41:51] <Camail> if you melee then jetpack quickly you go reallly far
[1:41:52] <DSD24> Style on them
[1:41:54] <%Nina96> omfg that looked so bsd
[1:41:58] <Mccoyster365> @Jordan276 What about the gaydomes and straightdomes?
[1:42:01] <%Animorphimagi> Why not FP view?
[1:42:03] <%UltraViolet371> this actually has something like bullet jumps from warframe using that shoulder move
[1:42:08] <%fruit_pie_the_magician> @AngriestPat if you dash, melee, and use the jetpack simultaneously you can fly forward really nice
[1:42:11] <+PolarBearPat> if you sprint melee and jump at the same time you boost a little
[1:42:13] <+Jordan276> @Mccoyster365 u can maket them urself with bases
[1:42:14] <+Cyoctane> Yeah but melee lets you super-jump and its extremely useful

[2:19:36] <+Merhabi> super top secret BLACK mineral
[2:19:41] <+Remery_> bye bouncing dick planet
[2:19:45] <%fruit_pie_the_magician> Can't you third person your ship too?
[2:19:48] <%Cykron> My wife died in a plane crash
[2:19:50] <+Jordan276> you can
[2:19:56] <+sunriser696> you can shoot by the way
[2:19:59] <%GarbageNirvana> If you can build a landing pad takeoffs are free
[2:20:04] <%GarbageNirvana> or find one
[2:20:07] <sparky77> LUL
[2:20:13] <+amiroodude> Whoops
[2:20:25] <%Engwithan_Elder_God> All of your landings have been "perfect".
[2:20:26] <+Jordan276> its alright go out and analyse to find buried tech
[2:20:26] <sparky77> dont worry pat, that happens to everyone
[2:20:27] <%EveningMars> jumping coral animals
[2:20:31] <%SilverFaustX> wheres elmo
[2:20:46] <%EveningMars> back on the ship
[2:20:53] <KasiCrafter> Could be worse. Could have a ship autopilot which throws you into THE SUN.
[2:21:02] <%fruit_pie_the_magician> you can literally fly around the whole planet
[2:21:02] <%solidousstream> did pat stick himself on a desolate waste land
[2:21:13] <%Oz_Bunny> landing pad
[2:21:21] <sonofthedeepsouth> Look at Pat he also watches internet historian. What a meme man
[2:21:27] <%GarbageNirvana> missed it
[2:21:30] <JesusFromSpace> Landing pads take no fuel I think
[2:21:31] <sonofthedeepsouth> A man made of memes one might say
[2:21:31] <RubberFistFight> @KasiCrafter you mean like all those times he drove into the sun in Outer Wilds ? :P
[2:21:40] <%zafooru> illusory grass ahead
[2:21:45] <Nitsuj293> msobliThink
[2:21:47] <AGuyNamedFrank> @AngriestPat if you land on a landing pad, it doesn't cost fuel
[2:21:48] <KasiCrafter> Exactly that!
[2:22:06] <sonofthedeepsouth> clearly
[2:22:09] <%solidousstream> yes
[2:22:11] <sparky77> thats not a landing pad
[2:22:15] <FutaSnek> nO
[2:22:27] <%michingmallecho> That’s no moon kaceyHEH
[2:22:32] <FutaSnek> Chat is wrong its the green glowy thing you landed on
[2:22:33] <%solidousstream> that's my mom
[2:22:33] <+Delenay> go back to the machine you fixed
[2:22:33] <sparky77> i know, but trust me, its not
[2:22:37] <StromkoPenguin> Removing the rusted metal fixes the container, you keep leaving before you get the actual loot
[2:22:42] <+Delenay> you unlocked stuff in the box
[2:22:46] <Saltmeisterr> its a comm tower right?
[2:22:46] <%GarbageNirvana> You know you can just discard junk material to open those up btw
[2:22:58] <%GarbageNirvana> In case you're low on inventory space
[2:23:01] <+Delenay> currency!
[2:23:09] <%JJCheeker> You're odd
[2:23:14] <%Engwithan_Elder_God> They have a flag and everything.
[2:23:17] <+Huderga> poop on the floor and make it yours
[2:23:25] <sparky77> you removed the rust, now open it again
[2:23:46] <Narukamiiii> you can sell shit in the future so i would say to try not throwin stuff just put it in your ship's storage
[2:23:50] <Reanimator83> If you’re close enough to your ship you can transfer any items over to it
[2:23:55] <%GeneralSCPatton> Find the G.E.C.K. Chosen One
[2:23:56] <Brother_Coduss> @AngriestPat maybe drop the stack of fucking rusted shit
[2:24:00] <Devilkirbyfan> that was worth a lot of money
[2:24:18] <Saltmeisterr> wait did he transfer or discard it?
[2:24:22] <%JJCheeker> Nice
[2:24:37] <%Vegaburd> Vegaburd subscribed at Tier 1. They've subscribed for 3 months! you still playin league?
[2:24:40] <sparky77> not worthless persay but worth less than other stuff
[2:24:42] <+ForteBlade> you can drop the rust
[2:24:42] <PlumpPotatoRump> 'Junk'
[2:24:43] <%GarbageNirvana> I mean you can process it into other shit
[2:24:45] <Brother_Coduss> it's literally rust
[2:24:50] <%GarbageNirvana> It's not efficient tho
[2:24:52] <TyrantSlime> It isn't worth the inventory slot
[2:24:57] <maebold> It processes into a decent amount of ferrite
[2:24:58] <Saltmeisterr> i can sell it
[2:25:03] <%JJCheeker> Can you dig into any spot?
[2:25:04] <+amiroodude> Not worth keeping
[2:25:04] <+SweetBabyBuddha> did they add gameplay to this yet?
[2:25:15] <sparky77> try clicking
[2:25:18] <+amiroodude> In space
[2:25:22] <%zafooru> you can grind the rust and mix with acid to make a rusty acid potion
[2:25:32] <Brother_Coduss> @AngriestPat i think you have a secondary weapon too
[2:25:33] <Saltmeisterr> S C H U T
[2:25:35] <+ForteBlade> pew pew
[2:25:43] <Renkage> I honestly expect Pat to play League of Legends more than No Man's Sky.
[2:25:43] <%GarbageNirvana> He got the pew pew lasers
[2:25:52] <sparky77> well, you ARE on a moon
[2:26:00] <%JJCheeker> Flying through space ain't like dusting crops Pat
[2:26:02] <%fruit_pie_the_magician> @AngriestPat its actually more efficient to mine in space for asteroids for some materials
[2:26:12] <OswaldTheDog> he going zoomie
[2:26:25] <%JJCheeker> I would like to learn about gamer goo
[2:26:35] <Deadbulky> Pat totally not playing nms cus of intnet historian LU
[2:26:40] <Renkage> Not saying that No Man's Sky is bad ( I like it). Just saying it's very niche
[2:26:57] <sparky77> @AngriestPat who is this "internet historian" that people keep talking about???
[2:27:05] <+BusterRepukken> NMS is another Death Stranding, not everyones cup of piss
[2:27:16] <%GarbageNirvana> I might go back to it, looks like they may have ironed some bugs out
[2:27:16] <%Emperor_Machinus> filled with pirates
[2:27:20] <+LeonPup> this seems very outerworlds like

[2:27:44] <zamzoph> "get out of my ass"
[2:27:44] <+Psych_man13_13> You know Pat, with the right ship upgrades, you can totally be a space pirate
[2:27:45] <%1matheuw> oh hey pat i havent seen you since last year

[2:28:08] <OswaldTheDog> what if i like your ass?
[2:28:09] <+BusterRepukken> @JJCheeker Pyrite is not right with me. It dont get the bitches, you seeee
[2:28:16] <Renkage> I heavily suggest playing this in VR. Flying in VR is an amazing experience. Also I see Pat found the Dap Jump

Also, what is this, modded all to hell, or is this what it turned into after the shitshow it was before? If it's the latter, shit, guess I gotta try it now.

[2:30:12] <JesusFromSpace> scammed
[2:30:12] <+ForteBlade> condensed carbon gives you waaaay more time
[2:30:15] <Brother_Coduss> @AngriestPat you put in 8 seconds worth of fuel you dunce
[2:30:15] <%TheOnlyStrayCat> PFFFFR.
[2:30:17] <%fruit_pie_the_magician> Carbon is just bad
[2:30:21] <%TaifuDragon> Carbon bad
[2:30:22] <%Caped_Eggy> Cut off your hand and put it in
[2:30:22] <Swish19XX> Yep, you need to get batteries and solar panels to actually get set up with power
[2:30:23] <+Jordan276> dont put oxygen
[2:30:25] <Narukamiiii> I mean you only need it on for a sec to click the portal
[2:30:27] <%Garthunox> you burnt a gas dude, and not a very flammable one
[2:30:27] <+Jordan276> NNOOO

[2:30:55] <%zafooru> bab carbon
[2:31:15] <sparky77> 16
[2:31:31] <+Jordan276> Lets go the space Station
[2:31:33] <parnmkie> solar panels and battery's are better till you start making power plants
[2:31:41] <%zafooru> spaaaaace
[2:31:46] <Katorskay> Uchuu kitaaa
[2:31:53] <+sunriser696> going back to space
[2:31:54] <+amiroodude> The final frontier
[2:31:56] <%Caped_Eggy> One way ride
[2:31:56] <%Cykron> Ford Dab has me shook
[2:31:58] <%JJCheeker> Captains log
[2:32:01] <mrblack499> did they fix it?

[2:32:30] <%LittleBigQuebec> why is there another hype train
[2:32:32] <+Jordan276> try 3rd person
[2:32:39] <+Cyoctane> Go to space station and customize your character
[2:32:40] <Mr_Strut> Just be better
[2:32:45] <MrJackett> Tip: Landing and taking off from space stations and building ship docks cost no launch fuel
[2:32:46] <+LiveStreamOnyx> 3rd person might be better
[2:32:51] <%EveningMars> balloon asteroids
[2:32:54] <$RenegadeHatter> Shoot the rocks!
[2:32:57] <%JJCheeker> Go to Babylon 5
[2:33:01] <%zafooru> pew pew
[2:33:06] <+Jordan276> nice
[2:33:09] <%SilverFaustX> these space rocks have stuff
[2:33:11] <zamzoph> @EveningMars just like Gundam PogChamp
[2:33:11] <Narukamiiii> the asteriods have stuff in them
[2:33:21] <%EveningMars> PogChamp
[2:33:23] <sparky77> shoot that shit
[2:33:25] <FalseEyeD> Shoot Rock, Get Big
[2:33:27] <Brother_Coduss> @AngriestPat i think you should have a secondary weapon on your ship. also, if you shoot the asteroids you get stuff
[2:33:29] <+parrotman01> I've heard this game is good now
[2:33:31] <+amiroodude> Shoot de asteroids
[2:33:38] <stevo_scar> B5? a person of culture
[2:33:42] <+G_Thunders> Does NMS really count as niche anymore? It’s a survival game with base building and online multiplayer. Like, just that alone makes it part of a huge genre
[2:33:45] <Spironito> is this game good now?
[2:33:48] <%SilverFaustX> b5 was great
[2:34:00] <Naho_Saenoki> @Spironito Yeah, actually.
[2:34:04] <Spironito> neat
[2:34:09] <+aegismke> Yeah
[2:34:10] <%LittleBigQuebec> game done, we already got the plat
[2:34:10] <+Jordan276> time to go to space station
[2:34:14] <%1matheuw> can you buy space hats with it?
[2:34:17] <+amiroodude> Look at all that monies
[2:34:25] <grayjammer> the PLATINUM structure
[2:34:34] <+Cyoctane> New element discovered: Patinum
[2:34:35] <MrJackett> you will not find it here
[2:34:35] <%Caped_Eggy> Why do you want my anium?
[2:34:37] <Mudstone12> plat is important i think
[2:34:39] <TakesGuts> atpCap
[2:34:40] <%EveningMars> gotta go to Uranus for Uranium
[2:34:40] <Manwad> uranium would be planetside, no?
[2:34:41] <%LittleBigQuebec> @AngriestPat you wnat My Anium?
[2:34:44] <%fruit_pie_the_magician> SHOOT THE BIG TURD ONES
[2:34:46] <Naho_Saenoki> Tritium, you say? Time to give it to Otto Octavius so he can make his mini-sun experiments.
[2:34:46] <Mudstone12> collect as many as possible
[2:34:47] <%SilverFaustX> uranium is on planets
[2:34:48] <Narukamiiii> You're on your way to a spacestation where you can sell stuff
[2:34:52] <+sunriser696> uranium is mostly on radioctive planets
[2:34:56] <Brother_Coduss> @AngriestPat uranium is planet based me thinks. also, press the gun switch button, i think you should have rockets installed on the ship
[2:34:57] <Spironito> is it one big server for the multiplayer?
[2:35:03] <%Garthunox> get your anium
[2:35:04] <+Jordan276> not really
[2:35:05] <Mr_Strut> This game needs more planet crackers
[2:35:09] <+Jordan276> each system is a server
[2:35:16] <%luftraumm1> IRC you can use hydrogen in place of it
[2:35:20] <Narukamiiii> Engage
[2:35:24] <+ForteBlade> You can warp through planets
[2:35:28] <+Jordan276> use the pulse drive
[2:35:30] <%UltraViolet371> we got time
[2:35:31] <+YabbaTroll> ye
[2:35:34] <%SilverFaustX> keep it on while sleep
[2:35:34] <+Cyoctane> Time to meet some asshole aliens
[2:35:35] <worldbrand> we vibin
[2:35:39] <%AbsoluteTravisty> hell yeah slow drift 24 hour stream

[2:35:44] <%BallerSwagBro9k> OH BOI HERE WE GO
[2:35:48] <+ForteBlade> no you don't
[2:35:52] <sparky77> @AngriestPat you dont need to navitage around the planet, just point at the thing and pulse drive, autopilot will handle the rest
[2:35:53] <MrJackett> Just pulse. Ship will curve round planets
[2:35:53] <%EveningMars> let's all listen to lofi beats and watch the ship fly into asteroids on cruise control
[2:35:54] <%Emperor_Machinus> @Mr_Strut most games need more planet crackers
[2:35:54] <Spironito> hmm is player hunting a thing in this?
[2:35:55] <+sunriser696> you dont
[2:35:57] <+Cyoctane> No...
[2:35:58] <+aegismke> This ship isn’t boxy enough
[2:35:59] <%zafooru> these rocks give me BIG anxiety

[2:36:12] <+YabbaTroll> bitrate kill drive
[2:36:15] <Narukamiiii> the bitrate dwarf just stole all my pixels
[2:36:17] <+kraajkase> it would do it automatically
[2:36:17] <Mr_Strut> It's a good thing your ship phases through rocks
[2:36:18] <+ForteBlade> Pulse brings you to whatever you are locked on to
[2:36:19] <+sunriser696> rip bitrate
[2:36:21] <%zafooru> DUNGEONS AND DRAGoNS??

[2:53:26] <%MegboyManuel> MegboyManuel subscribed at Tier 1. They've subscribed for 13 months! Been seeing you on twitter and discord recently and all i can say is. But Pat, i like the pokemon, and if you dont like it also, you smell and should feel bad.
[2:53:29] <+JOHNNYROCKETFlNGERS> big travel

[2:53:40] <Ipsenscastle> good luck taking off again now
[2:53:41] <%Caped_Eggy> That's convenient
[2:53:54] <+YabbaTroll> FORT DAB
[2:54:00] <%MegboyManuel> man this games looking so much better
[2:54:00] <Renkage> @1matheuw Because video games.
[2:54:03] <%1matheuw> i mean its better than losing your ship
[2:54:04] <+Jordan276> 16
[2:54:05] <+smoe79> 16
[2:54:06] <RamenRiderZ> such a high tech cottage
[2:54:09] <%SilverFaustX> if u run and hit melee and jetpack right after, u can go really fast
[2:54:12] <+Cyoctane> 16
[2:54:32] <%LittleBigQuebec> the MSQ symbol in this game is somewhat simmilaar to FFXIV one
[2:54:37] <ape_hawk> 16/16/16 is a fertilizer type, btw
[2:54:47] <kingmorsluciscaelum> how you likin the game pat
[2:54:50] <+Jordan276> u mine it
[2:54:53] <Renkage> It's on your compass.
[2:54:53] <%GarbageNirvana> Blue crystals
[2:54:55] <+YabbaTroll> you need 2 hydrogren i bet
[2:55:01] <worldbrand> just take a water and slurp out the oxygen
[2:55:12] <JesusFromSpace> yes
[2:55:14] <sparky77> ye thats on planet
[2:55:16] <%UltraViolet371> yeah, it'd say off-planet if it wasn't
[2:55:16] <+Jordan276> by walk?
[2:55:16] <Ipsenscastle> sure is
[2:55:17] <%GarbageNirvana> You can get there in about 20 minutes by jogging
[2:55:31] <%fruit_pie_the_magician> @AngriestPat it's on planet, but probably beyond the curvature
[2:55:42] <Ipsenscastle> this planet is fucking horrible
[2:56:18] <%UltraViolet371> Mining laser tip: There's a heat-up mechanic where holding it down longer makes the mining go faster!
[2:56:26] <Narukamiiii> i may be wrong but i think most tutorial zone planets are super great, to push you to gtfo
[2:56:35] <RamenRiderZ> Pat has unlocked area scan?
[2:56:36] <Narukamiiii> are not *
[2:56:51] <%GarbageNirvana> @Narukamiiii afaik it's completely random
[2:57:05] <sparky77> you CAN open those red ones too btw
[2:57:09] <%GarbageNirvana> I've started games where I show up on super radiated bullshit and die in ten seconds
[2:57:23] <Renkage> Yeah. IMO, Pat shouldn't have built his base on the starting planets. But I guess he can just ditch this base if he finds a rad planet
[2:57:24] <FalseEyeD> @GarbageNirvana LUL
[2:57:27] <Narukamiiii> yes but you can randomize within certain parameters
[2:57:36] <DrFacilier> So i just joined, is this really No Mans Sky?
[2:57:41] <%UltraViolet371> You can have infinite bases so it doesn't matter anyway
[2:57:52] <+Jordan276> u can delete this one too
[2:58:03] <+hax_metatron> Base
[2:58:05] <ape_hawk> yeah, his second base can be Castle Duper Beast
[2:58:05] <Renkage> Really? It's been awhile, but I thought you could just fuck off to another system?
[2:58:06] <$Slimshazbot> y-yes this is no mans sky?
[2:58:06] <+PenmanLupine> no it's Battletoads
[2:58:07] <Brother_Coduss> @AngriestPat game lets you plonk it down on what ever planet you're on and adjusts accordingly
[2:58:08] <%Fatmanjoggin> I haven't played in a bit but thats a BIG inventory
[2:58:09] <+JOHNNYROCKETFlNGERS> this is No Man's Sky @drfacilier
[2:58:14] <$arcielardor> so is the game crappy? legit wanna know.
[2:58:18] <+amiroodude> His house is a basically a shed so he's not losing anything really
[2:58:18] <%GarbageNirvana> You can buy better mining lasers
[2:58:18] <star_feline> yeah, buy a better gun
[2:58:29] <Renkage> Well dang
[2:58:31] <Narukamiiii> you upgrade all your stuff
[2:58:35] <%1matheuw> i heard you could lose your main mission by traveling too much
[2:58:38] <$Slimshazbot> @arcielardor It's pretty good
[2:58:56] <$RealThiele> jill hopping in a spaceship to blast umbrella
[2:58:58] <+Jordan276> this is where the story begins
[2:59:02] <FalseEyeD> A small jog away
[2:59:02] <%fruit_pie_the_magician> Eventually you can find a really sweetass planet to build a really sweetass base. I built one on a planet with a red sky with giant floating chaos emerald islands over an ocean where it never stopped raining. it was fucking sweet
[2:59:03] <kingbaconcrispy> Did you just start?!
[2:59:08] <+mikesapartment> Enjoying game patrick?
[2:59:12] <%UltraViolet371> @1matheuw if that happens I think it'll re-assign the mission to spawn close to you
[2:59:13] <Brother_Coduss> @AngriestPat your starting planet sucks ass btw
[2:59:16] <+Jordan276> the story of the game begins now
[2:59:19] <sparky77> YO
[2:59:22] <Solidnick18> this is a pretty planet
[2:59:23] <+Jordan276> PogChamp
[2:59:24] <Solidnick18> HUH
[2:59:26] <%GarbageNirvana> @fruit_pie_the_magician Did you meet Knuckles
[2:59:28] <Ipsenscastle> @fruit_pie_the_magician I'm so jealous, I never found anywhere close to as nice as that
[2:59:29] <+LiveStreamOnyx> @fruit_pie_the_magician that’s dope lorNANI
[2:59:31] <ape_hawk> look, its boeing 747

[2:59:40] <sparky77> yeah the circles
[2:59:43] <+JOHNNYROCKETFlNGERS> a star destroyer?
[2:59:47] <RamenRiderZ> I hate it when otherwise nice planets are high security
[2:59:49] <sparky77> circles must be green to land
[2:59:59] <+Jordan276> 10/10
[3:00:00] <+Cyoctane> Landing pads dont use fuel btw
[3:00:00] <+amiroodude> Yeyeye
[3:00:09] <%UltraViolet371> free parking!
[3:00:12] <Iggeh0> you did it
[3:00:14] <Brother_Coduss> @AngriestPat some of the cargo's burried btw
[3:00:15] <$arcielardor> I'm actually a little surprised he's not playing Iceborne
[3:00:24] <+LiveStreamOnyx> Pat the Ratt did it mischaDab
[3:00:27] <+JOHNNYROCKETFlNGERS> ooh metal creaking sounds
[3:00:39] <%EveningMars> wheatly is out of commission
[3:00:41] <+Jordan276> u can explore the crash freighter if u want
[3:00:42] <Ipsenscastle> REAPERS
[3:00:44] <Narukamiiii> isn't that the robot from Portal 2
[3:00:51] <RamenRiderZ> Iceborne's apparently borked on pc
[3:01:27] <Brother_Coduss> @AngriestPat 5 microcessors
[3:01:31] <%GarbageNirvana> You can find em in chests and stuff too iirc
[3:01:32] <+Jordan276> u need to sell stuff u have in ur inventory
[3:01:34] <banditohum> Time to do some jobs
[3:01:36] <%GarbageNirvana> Easier to buy em though
[3:01:39] <%cylish> i just got here, why is pat a triangle head?
[3:01:41] <%EveningMars> oh ya know, just gonna go make some microprocessors in my shed
[3:01:44] <+amiroodude> Welp back to space station I guess
[3:01:46] <Nox_ludicro> @RamenRiderZ what's wrong with it?
[3:01:57] <$RenegadeHatter> Now the game opens UP
[3:02:00] <%Fatmanjoggin> pick them straight off the microprocessor tree
[3:02:03] <heybenice> I like the hat
[3:02:07] <Saltmeisterr> can't he explore the station?
[3:02:08] <%MelBrooksKA> @cylish Because he ain't no square
[3:02:14] <Saltmeisterr> i mean freighter
[3:02:23] <%Caped_Eggy> Mine some shit on the way maybe
[3:02:24] <sparky77> nope
[3:02:27] <%cylish> valid
[3:02:31] <+Cyoctane> Nope
[3:02:32] <sparky77> autopilot does it all
[3:02:35] <banditohum> DONT. STOP.
[3:02:39] <banditohum> O GOD ROCKS
[3:02:40] <%GeneralSCPatton> Imagine finding a whole Star of Platinum
[3:02:42] <$RenegadeHatter> They changed EVERYTHING
[3:02:44] <+Cyoctane> Muh pixels
[3:02:50] <%cylish> its impressive how youre not hitting any of those rocks at that speed
[3:02:53] <%PauliusMaximus> these rocks should be ripping your ship to pieces
[3:03:03] <RamenRiderZ> @nox_ludicro apparently freezes the game, stands around 38%~ on steam
[3:03:10] <Nox_ludicro> Ooof
[3:03:17] <Ipsenscastle> eesh clippy
[3:03:18] <+ForteBlade> Btw you can just use the teleporter to go to any stations you have visited
[3:03:21] <+amiroodude> Man I really thought Sean Murray ran the fuck away in 2016
[3:03:25] <%GeneralSCPatton> I believe that phases you through small obstacles
[3:03:26] <+amiroodude> Man I was wring
[3:03:27] <sparky77> eh the clipping is fine honestly
[3:03:35] <+amiroodude> *wrong
[3:03:35] <%Townspoon> well thats some clipping
[3:03:36] <%Caped_Eggy> Oh that didn't look good
[3:03:37] <+Jordan276> u should sell yeah
[3:03:43] <%fruit_pie_the_magician> I actually attached a James Bond underwater base to my base that on my floating island, complete with an elevator up to the land one and glass tubed rooms and a sub base and shit
[3:03:46] <Narukamiiii> they have high tech walls that allow clipping
[3:04:03] <+LiveStreamOnyx> @fruit_pie_the_magician you’re making me want to play again
[3:04:10] <+hax_metatron> This game works best if you think of it as "Trippy 70s sci fi covers come to life" rather than "impeccable space adventure game"
[3:04:14] <+Jordan276> korvax casting
[3:04:24] <Saltmeisterr> CUBE
[3:04:25] <Ipsenscastle> @fruit_pie_the_magician I want that, I don't wanna have to do the work though
[3:04:26] <sparky77> youre switching inventories not selling pat
[3:04:40] <+ForteBlade> switch to your ship invintory
[3:04:41] <+amiroodude> On ur ship
[3:04:41] <%misha_kastrilevich> BUY
[3:04:43] <+Jordan276> u need to sell the korvax casting
[3:04:44] <%TaifuDragon> @AngriestPat Green background items are junk ,they have no use besides being sold
[3:04:45] <Saltmeisterr> switch to ship
[3:04:48] <zombieKillaKlown> hey pat any coments on Pokeman dlc
[3:04:49] <%misha_kastrilevich> SELL
[3:05:02] <sparky77> you need like 90k somethin
[3:05:03] <%fruit_pie_the_magician> Then don't do the work, the creative mode lets you do anything you want without having to mine or farm rocks
[3:05:07] <%Caped_Eggy> That's no where enough
[3:05:12] <star_feline> Just wait until Pat buys the bitcoin whood
[3:05:12] <Saltmeisterr> sell cube
[3:05:19] <+Jordan276> u didnt sell everything
[3:05:22] <Renkage> Do missions. There should be a mission vender on the station
[3:05:24] <%Kiiper> cubes are worth a lot
[3:05:32] <Ipsenscastle> blow up some tritium crystals in space, youll be done in seconds
[3:05:39] <+Jordan276> yes
[3:05:43] <RamenRiderZ> You can also find Space 7/11's on planets, they can also sell what u need
[3:05:43] <%UltraViolet371> yeah vortex cubes exist to be sold
[3:05:44] <sparky77> yeah cubes are just sellables
[3:05:45] <+ForteBlade> cubes exist to be sold
[3:05:50] <+Jordan276> and the korvax thing
[3:05:53] <star_feline> But what if you need them Kappa
[3:06:04] <%fruit_pie_the_magician> You can build race tracks for your huge mining cars, and honestly finding cool planets is hard with finite warp cores
[3:06:09] <Saltmeisterr> theres missions too
[3:06:16] <%UltraViolet371> well you can use korvax stuff for other things, but the credits are more valuable right now
[3:06:18] <%MisterTylerrr> Pat, this stream has been amazing nap fodder
[3:06:27] <+Jordan276> sell the gek relik
[3:06:36] <+Jordan276> and the korvax thing
[3:06:36] <%TaifuDragon> @AngriestPat sell the rusted metal
[3:06:40] <Ipsenscastle> sell korvax case
[3:06:46] <%EveningMars> NMS is just really chill
[3:06:47] <zamzoph> ResidentSleeper
[3:06:52] <%crimsonharvest> im way chilled out ur doing good
[3:06:53] <%GarbageNirvana> Game's chill it's cool
[3:06:53] <star_feline> I'm glad I wasnt the only one who napped
[3:06:53] <ape_hawk> its been amazing FAP fodder, he meant
[3:06:54] <sparky77> im enjoying it
[3:06:55] <%MrBorisMakarov> NMS is chill
[3:06:56] <Renkage> Gek Relik can also be sold. But you can also use those to increase friendship with Gek
[3:07:00] <%MisterTylerrr> It's the background noise of the ship. It's a good stream don't worry
[3:07:01] <%Kiiper> The sound design with your chill commentary has been great
[3:07:01] <+Jordan276> welp rip
[3:07:03] <Renkage> So up to you
[3:07:06] <%Kiiper> Just lying back half asleep
[3:07:07] <$RenegadeHatter> Arent you feeling relaxed?
[3:07:10] <RubberFistFight> @AngriestPat be flattered with one side of your brain and insulted with the other.
[3:07:10] <DrFacilier> Pat u play this but not Subnautica
[3:07:13] <%EveningMars> it's a shut-brain-off game. and when you combine that with pat? ResidentSleeper
[3:07:23] <DrFacilier> dammit
[3:07:25] <%cylish> Worth picking this up now? I avoided it way back when due to the troubles.
[3:07:28] <Brother_Coduss> @AngriestPat farm tritium, or find one of those biiiiig asteroids and chip away at it
[3:07:32] <%cvp5127> pat hates starving
[3:07:34] <CrimsonGargoyle> LUL
[3:07:36] <ape_hawk> Sean Murray, add hunger mechanics to NMS, STAT
[3:07:37] <worldbrand> does subnautica have a coward mode?
[3:07:38] <+Cyoctane> When I played last summer I made 2 BILLION units selling hihghend craftable goods
[3:07:38] <spongeofmystery> Just turn off the hunger mechanics then
[3:07:39] <sparky77> @AngriestPat theres a mode in subnautica where you can play without thirst or hunger........
[3:07:40] <+Kise77> you can turn off the hunger in subnautica now can't you?
[3:07:40] <+amiroodude> Until the food mechanic gets patched in
[3:07:43] <+CounterBeard> we Asteroids now
[3:07:44] <%SilverFaustX> retroFAT
[3:07:45] <star_feline> you are always in danger of starving for oxygen Kappa
[3:07:47] <+Jordan276> there already food soo
[3:07:48] <%Taisuru> I mean the life support is basically hunger
[3:07:55] <%fruit_pie_the_magician> lol I used to get attacked by the sentinels until this game felt like fucking Horizon, I was being attacked by tyrannosaur sized robots and eventually the only way to survive was to dig straight through the ground into the caves
[3:07:57] <Brother_Coduss> @AngriestPat go shoot that big potato shaped one
[3:08:00] <Narukamiiii> Picard would not allow this
[3:08:00] <Kraigerex1> Hungry for Oxygen?
[3:08:04] <Mr_Strut> You realize Subnautica has a non survival mode right?
[3:08:05] <Ipsenscastle> buzz that planet!
[3:08:26] <DestroPrime83> @AngriestPat hey Pat is this game worth it now?
[3:08:41] <%fruit_pie_the_magician> ITS SOLID GOLD
[3:08:43] <Brother_Coduss> @AngriestPat also, you can swap weapons with triangle i think
[3:08:47] <+CounterBeard> Seems solid maybe
[3:08:53] <+Edrem> So who else watched the internet historian vid Kappa
[3:08:55] <+Jordan276> u just did the tutorial
[3:08:57] <%EveningMars> it sure has a lot of solid rocks
[3:09:03] <Renkage> It wont be everyones cup of tea. It's a lot of exploring
[3:09:03] <%BallerSwagBro9k> Still feels really boring to me
[3:09:04] <+Jordan276> soo u didnt do much of the game soo far
[3:09:05] <DestroPrime83> cause Hello is just poison to my mind right now and forever
[3:09:05] <+Taglog7> It's no raid shadow legends
[3:09:06] <+JOHNNYROCKETFlNGERS> seems very good for its price point nowadays
[3:09:09] <$Slimshazbot> @AngriestPat Why not just turn the survival stuff off in subnautica?
[3:09:10] <kingbaconcrispy> Is Sean Murray still sexy?
[3:09:10] <$RenegadeHatter> Underwater Bases are where its at!
[3:09:11] <Narukamiiii> The fact that you can play with friends adds a lot, just like minecraft
[3:09:12] <%MisterTylerrr> hello spider queen
[3:09:12] <%MrBorisMakarov> WHO SAID THAT

[3:22:03] <Renkage> Those planets are everywhere. Not sure what the lore is to make those planets travel across the stars. But they do
[3:22:21] <+Psych_man13_13> Man Pat, the more i watch the more i realize all of the quality of life changes they made that you dont even notice

[3:23:13] <+cereal_box_conspiracy> I don't understand how you make an entire game about travelling from planet to planet committing acts of geoterrorism.
[3:23:16] <%GarbageNirvana> I wonder how hard terrain manipulation stuff like this is to program
[3:23:24] <+amiroodude> I'ma sleep its 2am in UK. Peace

[3:26:13] <VyperVic> is the water bad?
[3:26:19] <%rumtumtugnutz> This one is dope
[3:26:20] <+ckangaroo15k> You only like it because it's orange like you.
[3:26:22] <%MisterTylerrr> This is your home now
[3:26:25] <%GarbageNirvana> Oxygen-powered robot
[3:26:28] <Monkeyweed21> need it for the orb
[3:26:29] <+PenmanLupine> that's all piss
[3:26:30] <%michingmallecho> This planet is really nice looking
[3:26:34] <FutaSnek> @AngriestPat IF this game has 1 thing going for it it's it's visual's I've been blown away by some of the stuff it's generated for me
[3:26:34] <Saltmeisterr> wet noises
[3:26:35] <Renkage> Obviously the crystal is powered by oxygen
[3:26:35] <%Maids4lyfe> activision tried to claim ownership of the word "candy" at one point
[3:26:46] <+cereal_box_conspiracy> Pat is steampowered, so he needs the oxygen.
[3:26:46] <%rumtumtugnutz> Cause he's secretly not a robot
[3:26:46] <VyperVic> imagine if all that water was oj
[3:26:52] <chronoxgp> water table
[3:26:57] <+Cyoctane> Wait until you find one of those rare mystery planets full of crazy shapes
[3:26:57] <ape_hawk> he needs oxygen so he can keep it away from the air-breathing lifeforms, in ultimate pat-fashion
[3:26:58] <+getinthetent> Activision is such ass
[3:26:58] <TakesGuts> if you are a stoner you always need air atpSuspect
[3:27:03] <RamenRiderZ> wasnt it King who did that
[3:27:08] <kingmorsluciscaelum> Mmmm, Ground OJ
[3:27:09] <RamenRiderZ> with Candy Crush
[3:27:10] <%yourliteraldog> Pyrimid Robot head
[3:27:14] <%crimsonharvest> do you suppose the high sea level is fucking it up
[3:27:14] <Brother_Coduss> @AngriestPat you know you should totally make Kame house, change to one of the lizard people, and be the pervy turtle hermit
[3:27:32] <%yourliteraldog> @RamenRiderZ i thought it was ***

[3:28:36] <%GarbageNirvana> Bugs me those markers don't disappear
[3:28:38] <%ForlornCarton> Pat, I don't know is it's still like this, but it used to be more efficient to mine with a smaller radius selected. You'd get more from each deposit like that.
[3:28:41] <%Divryne> MINE DIAMONDS.
[3:28:41] <%michingmallecho> Pyramid head? apatJpeg

[3:28:58] <Renkage> Underwater
[3:29:01] <sparky77> in water
[3:29:10] <chronoxgp> ferrite is irion
[3:29:11] <$RenegadeHatter> Peaceful and pretty, but scarce of resources
[3:29:13] <%rumtumtugnutz> You've seen a very smmall part of it thou
[3:29:16] <chronoxgp> **iron
[3:29:22] <RubberFistFight> Ferrite? Like.... rust?
[3:29:25] <Brother_Coduss> @AngriestPat that might be why the waters red tinted, iron in it
[3:29:26] <%yourliteraldog> blur
[3:29:33] <%yourliteraldog> Blue rocks
[3:29:36] <+Jordan276> the night will look amazing on this planet

[3:29:44] <Jakeofalco> why on earth is he playing this ?
[3:29:48] <blackbeard757> This looks like home 2.0
[3:29:54] <%Maids4lyfe> this is a very pretty planet for sure
[3:29:57] <Brother_Coduss> @RubberFistFight no, as in ferrous, which means consisting of iron
[3:30:00] <%michingmallecho> Because it’s kaceyTip
[3:30:03] <+JOHNNYROCKETFlNGERS> that blue sky on the orange sea
[3:30:07] <+JOHNNYROCKETFlNGERS> SeriousSloth
[3:30:09] <blackbeard757> Gotta get in your ship and fly to a different side of the planet t see how things change.
[3:30:15] <%kujofire990> I return
[3:30:24] <+Jordan276> did u forget it on the other planet.?
[3:30:26] <+Jordan276> LUL
[3:30:26] <%Kiiper> Ferrite is iron oxide plus a small amount of another metal which turns is ceramic like
[3:30:29] <sparky77> just make a new one
[3:30:40] <%GarbageNirvana> Forgot your portable refiner was portable did you
[3:30:42] <TheBadoe> It's very pretty here
[3:30:44] <Narukamiiii> Its portable, you have to pick it up LMAO
[3:30:52] <Brother_Coduss> wow, this planet has perfect weather
[3:30:54] <$RenegadeHatter> Just take the ship to the station and warp back
[3:30:57] <Saltmeisterr> yo it blue water now
[3:31:01] <Narukamiiii> thats actually so funny
[3:31:06] <+Jordan276> Oh yrd
[3:31:06] <blackbeard757> You gotta get the backpack refiner, so much better
[3:31:07] <Solidnick18> WTF
[3:31:07] <VyperVic> whoa
[3:31:08] <%Taisuru> Nice
[3:31:08] <XelGel> cool
[3:31:09] <%Maids4lyfe> yo that's amazing
[3:31:11] <TheBadoe> very pretty
[3:31:11] <haxzzer> YOOOOOOOOOOOOOO
[3:31:12] <%BallerSwagBro9k> I have a question for God WHYYYYYYYYYYY
[3:31:15] <%chiluzza> thats pretty awesome
[3:31:17] <+Jordan276> That why i buyed this game
[3:31:18] <RubberFistFight> @Brother_Coduss I know what it means. Ferrite is a stable-at-room-temperature allotrope of iron.
[3:31:20] <restingbones> Are you a robot? Or just a magic alien?
[3:31:22] <%Divryne> Your ship.
[3:31:22] <+JOHNNYROCKETFlNGERS> blu

[3:31:28] <%Rumbutt> Regular Estus during the day, Ashen Estus at night, perfect
[3:31:29] <%GarbageNirvana> Certain plants give you oxygen I think
[3:31:29] <blackbeard757> Put. Down. Base computer.
[3:31:33] <ape_hawk> COW CUS
[3:31:33] <sparky77> oxygen might actually be hard to come by on a planet like this
[3:31:35] <%GarbageNirvana> Like that one
[3:31:35] <%kujofire990> kujofire990 subscribed with Twitch Prime. They've subscribed for 28 months! yooo 28 months of watching the adventures of the gingers. Thanks
[3:31:35] <%Taisuru> Has the planet been named?
[3:31:38] <%UltraViolet371> now it's an Ashen Estus Flask!
[3:31:39] <%yourliteraldog> The gravity on that planet would be fucky irl
[3:31:39] <$antibonehurtingjuice> talk about out of left field
[3:31:42] <Renkage> Some rocks and even plants can give oxygen. Maybe scan more underwater?
[3:31:44] <+Psych_man13_13> I cant wait to see Pat get into a space battle
[3:31:49] <kingmorsluciscaelum> It's Planet ESTUS
[3:31:52] <kingmorsluciscaelum> home of the kame house
[3:31:52] <%chiluzza> that feeling we wont see planets like this for hundreds if not thousands of years
[3:31:54] <Brother_Coduss> @Taisuru Planet Estus
[3:31:56] <chronoxgp> yeah the water would follw the other planet
[3:32:05] <%Maids4lyfe> 13 celsius that's cold
[3:32:08] <kingmorsluciscaelum> sure we will, we're seeing it right now, the power of imagination
[3:32:13] <kingmorsluciscaelum> and also having a good game engine
[3:32:14] <+Jordan276> That a view
[3:32:25] <%Garthunox> @maids4lyfe not really
[3:32:27] <+Jordan276> worth living there
[3:32:27] <%mankeyfigh> Sorry I’m late, can anyone explain why Pat’s playing this game now?
[3:32:31] <StromkoPenguin> Interstellar travel may be an impossible dream but think of how cool videogames will be in ten years
[3:32:40] <%kujofire990> but WHAT IS WRONG WITH YOU FAAAAACE
[3:32:50] <chronoxgp> i'm playing outer worlds right now, it's pretty much what i want
[3:32:58] <$RenegadeHatter> Just head back to the station and warp to base
[3:33:05] <kingmorsluciscaelum> @mankeyfigh pat watched the internet historian video about how the game is good now
[3:33:17] <kingmorsluciscaelum> and it's been pretty good

[3:35:38] <+Jordan276> u need carbon for fuel
[3:35:46] <%Caped_Eggy> He's got enough

[3:36:00] <%GeneralSCPatton> @chronoxgp No, we must ket that life evolve into something we can lewd hellow2Face hellow2Blush hellow2Oh hellow2Hotaru
[3:36:03] <kingmorsluciscaelum> nailed it
[3:36:04] <%EveningMars> [sonic drowning music]
[3:36:11] <%yourliteraldog> carBON
[3:36:12] <%drabberfaun535> why do you even need air
[3:36:19] <Jakeofalco> @AngriestPat did you mods your inventory ?
[3:36:19] <Renkage> @AngriestPat You can also refine Carbon into condensed carbon. Pretty much just making them better fuel. It's useful to save up space
[3:36:20] <%EveningMars> robots need air too
[3:36:23] <kingmorsluciscaelum> it's just fun to have air
[3:36:27] <+cereal_box_conspiracy> this is the worst speedrun I've ever seen
[3:36:29] <%rumtumtugnutz> You should always make sure this is the case.
[3:36:29] <+Jordan276> yes u can do that
[3:36:30] <%MonsieurHedge> lewd
[3:36:30] <Ipsenscastle> Gross
[3:36:30] <%GarbageNirvana> @GeneralSCPatton Oh, like in Blue Submarine No. 6

[3:36:35] <CrimsonGargoyle> yeah refine me daddy
[3:36:37] <%Divryne> REFINE MY SHIT.
[3:36:44] <masterofzin> so is this game good now?
[3:36:52] <kingmorsluciscaelum> refine my blood so it's OJ instead
[3:36:57] <LunarRemix> That's just a colostomy bag
[3:36:59] <%JJCheeker> medicarbons
[3:37:07] <chronoxgp> is this why people didn't like mass effect ?
[3:37:09] <Solidnick18> it's something
[3:37:09] <Ner234> @GeneralSCPatton I'm ... gonna need the source on those faces ... for reasons ... and a friend
[3:37:12] <gespenst_mr_ghost> That's good
[3:37:14] <+ExpressNode> I never bought the game
[3:37:14] <$RenegadeHatter> Land Vehicles, Underwater Bases, Portable refining, and Better Ecosystems. We got it all!
[3:37:19] <kingmorsluciscaelum> this looks fun
[3:37:20] <Brother_Coduss> I bought it digital
[3:37:21] <Ipsenscastle> I thought it was gonna be Star Trek, but it's more Minecraft
[3:37:22] <%JJCheeker> Don't count on those steam reviews getting changed though
[3:37:26] <Ipsenscastle> Still big pretty
[3:37:27] <BallerSwagBro9k> Still boring tho imo
[3:37:34] <kingmorsluciscaelum> i'm tempted to buy it
[3:37:35] <+Jordan276> dont need them to be changed since its very postivie
[3:37:35] <%GarbageNirvana> I played it right after the last big patch and it was pretty buggy in places so I'm curious to see if said places have been ironed out
[3:37:40] <%mield916> noted. I've been partially jumped on and off since the original launch.
[3:37:45] <%GarbageNirvana> Might take a bit to get there tho
[3:37:53] <%UltraViolet371> and so much of the new stuff are mechanical things buried dozens hours in
[3:38:03] <%JJCheeker> There were many many many
[3:38:06] <$rytyoung> I didn't keep it wish I did now
[3:38:09] <%PauliusMaximus> theres so many people there after internet historians video saying how good a comeback story it is
[3:38:09] <%D00msDayDan> have you seen iceborne getting fucking nuked on steam reviews because of the performance fuckups?
[3:38:12] <%Tearonex> I've had it since launch and never went back to it, this is making want to play again
[3:38:24] <%JJCheeker> I bought it on there but my PC is s*** and I didn't realize it
[3:38:27] <Ipsenscastle> Also the only people playing now know what theyre getting into
[3:38:30] <%JJCheeker> So I got a refund
[3:38:31] <%swordmanegill> swordmanegill subscribed at Tier 1. They've subscribed for 9 months! What the shit is this poop? Love, from Iceland .
[3:38:33] <$RenegadeHatter> The League problem, people upset that the bad game got good and no one should have fun because of that
[3:38:41] <Renkage> It's still a niche game. If you go into this game expecting Star Wars. It's not gonna be that. You are a space explorer and a glorified space trucker
[3:38:45] <Narukamiiii> This game is good now, and if you have a couple of friends to play with , its pretty neat
[3:38:49] <%UltraViolet371> ooh, FTL is paradox-free in this
[3:38:54] <Brother_Coduss> the fuck is a warp hyper core
[3:39:03] <+spiceyweasle> is no man's sky always online?
[3:39:03] <%Caped_Eggy> In a way this somewhat similar to death stranding
[3:39:15] <chronoxgp> If Joe Pera played videogames, this is the game he'd play
[3:39:19] <kingmorsluciscaelum> Pat should play PermaDeath mode
[3:39:24] <%chiluzza> antimatter on planet would just leave fuckhuge holes
[3:39:34] <CrimsonGargoyle> hope you uploaded Estus @AngriestPat
[3:39:35] <chronoxgp> just walk around space collecting rocks

[3:39:47] <chronoxgp> Nice
[3:39:49] <%GarbageNirvana> Did we actually name the planet Estus
[3:39:53] <VyperVic> estus is a good name because at night it becomes the magic estus
[3:39:56] <+JOHNNYROCKETFlNGERS> yes
[3:39:59] <%swordmanegill> nice
[3:40:06] <%Maids4lyfe> saves it

[3:43:58] <%yourliteraldog> Deadspace apparently
[3:44:01] <Ambiguous_Anti> usually better to just discard that but taking it works too
[3:44:02] <%Laecerelius> Oops, All Nurgle?
[3:44:03] <%rumtumtugnutz> Probably Xenomorphs.
[3:44:06] <%misha_kastrilevich> Its Dead Space
[3:44:09] <ape_hawk> is this doom?
[3:44:13] <DonWolo> Effluvial grime.

[3:44:32] <%Fatmanjoggin> Someone forgot to turn on the gellar field
[3:44:36] <%walternatorz> just like how mom used to make it
[3:44:40] <zenith0111> Hows the gameplay?
[3:44:50] <CanadianAdam> HI Pat
[3:44:55] <+Jordan276> that creepy
[3:45:00] <%rumtumtugnutz> OOPS ALL BUTTHOLES
[3:45:02] <$RenegadeHatter> New specimen in the back
[3:45:05] <%yourliteraldog> Eat some of it
[3:45:12] <%Piemen99> disgusting even
[3:45:12] <+falcon1030> are there space battles?
[3:45:13] <blackbeard757> Now shoot egg?
[3:45:17] <+razielhex> all customizations are free; it's easy to expand your inventory. You can even upgrade starships;and if he ever builds a buggy it's fun as hell
[3:45:18] <Brother_Coduss> chromatic metal to the right too
[3:45:20] <%Kiiper> Yes Falcon
[3:45:21] <+321Continue> how we doing gamers
[3:45:23] <+Jordan276> u will need cooper too
[3:45:25] <%MisterTylerrr> That Carbon? Na
[3:45:27] <sparky77> refine maybe?
[3:45:28] <Renkage> You refine carbon
[3:45:28] <+razielhex> You use your refiner
[3:45:33] <VyperVic> crush i
[3:45:34] <CrimsonGargoyle> you take carbon and you condense it 4Head
[3:45:35] <bluefooddye1> Just squeeze it really hard
[3:45:39] <%yourliteraldog> Heat it in a spoon
[3:45:40] <RubberFistFight> @AngriestPat you take some carbon and you condense it, duh Kappa
[3:45:46] <Brother_Coduss> @AngriestPat you use the carbon to refine the carbon
[3:45:47] <%Faustgesicht> Faustgesicht subscribed at Tier 1. They've subscribed for 19 months! oh we got third person no man's sky. neat.
[3:45:48] <zenith0111> Whoa wait Pats a robot? LUL
[3:45:57] <Renkage> Condensed Carbon is also just better Carbon when it comes to fuel
[3:45:57] <joylent_blue> saying carbon like that reminds me of PARGON
[3:45:58] <+razielhex> tcarbon + carbon = carbon+
[3:46:16] <Ipsenscastle> Extreme flavourblasted carbon
[3:46:19] <+razielhex> chromatic metal is usually cobalt, from caves
[3:46:30] <+Jordan276> LUCKY
[3:46:31] <sparky77> lol
[3:46:32] <%UltraViolet371> this planet has been kind
[3:46:34] <%Zaphire_Saucypants> it's allll comin together
[3:46:37] <%Piemen99> @zenith0111 of course would he be anything else?
[3:46:38] <%Rumbutt> calculated
[3:46:38] <%rumtumtugnutz> You puYou need mor CHROMATIC METAL zerp zerp
[3:46:43] <%Quigsies> lucky ted
[3:46:43] <Monkeyweed21> lots of metals can be used for chromatic metal
[3:46:46] <+Jordan276> scripted
[3:46:46] <StromkoPenguin> Cobalt is its own thing, it has its own upgrade tree separate from chromatic
[3:46:46] <Ipsenscastle> All comin' up Milhouse
[3:46:50] <Renkage> Chromatic Metal is always needed
[3:46:51] <clueless_reaper> Hey I'm behind, is this game good now?
[3:46:54] <Ner234> Streaner Luck DansGame
[3:46:55] <%Rumbutt> speedrun strats unlocked
[3:46:56] <+razielhex> can can use the miner for that as well.
[3:46:56] <+skyheys> no
[3:46:59] <Brother_Coduss> @razielhex in this, the chromatic metal in a system depends on the star. cobalt for blue, copper for red. cant remember what the green stars have
[3:47:03] <%Rumbutt> just have the things you need be next to you
[3:47:04] <%rumtumtugnutz> At least you don't need polyphonic metal.
[3:47:05] <+skyheys> just better
[3:47:18] <%UltraViolet371> might as well make a bunch of warp cells
[3:47:26] <zenith0111> Oddly satisfying
[3:47:30] <clueless_reaper> @skyheys okay I get you
[3:47:32] <%GarbageNirvana> It's like big shiny chicken nuggets
[3:47:38] <+LickyLickySweaty> @clueless_reaper It's way better, but just keep watching if it's a game for you
[3:47:38] <+Astrokaizoku> Shoot eggs by building
[3:47:40] <%valriot> This is just what if mining planet in Mass Effect was a game
[3:47:49] <%rumtumtugnutz> Don't shoot the eggs

[3:48:54] <rockywm> @AngriestPat I'm fighting people on the subreddit right now about the Celest thing on your twitter lmao
[3:48:56] <Monkeyweed21> carboncle
[3:48:59] <zenith0111> Pat is devolving before our eyes
[3:49:00] <%Zaphire_Saucypants> carBONated SOdaaaa
[3:49:00] <%anticrust> it fun
[3:49:03] <%rumtumtugnutz> It's cause you're having fun. HOW DARE YOU.
[3:49:05] <+321Continue> Carbs on
[3:49:05] <+Torei_san> Is this like turning Zarbon into T H I C C Zarbon?
[3:49:07] <%valriot> I just thought it was because of Quebec being a fucking cartoon world
[3:49:08] <Ambiguous_Anti> Pat say Indium
[3:49:08] <%suikudo> You do and thats just how it be
[3:49:10] <%misha_kastrilevich> I've been playing Death Stranding
[3:49:11] <%GeneralSCPatton> It's a verbal tic, and it's contagious
[3:49:15] <DeebzNutz100> it's a gift
[3:49:18] <%Ranryu692> @AngriestPat what do you think your chances are of getting onto the $5?
[3:49:19] <corepercentlives> we all want our own personal language
[3:49:23] <%rumtumtugnutz> AUNTYMATTER
[3:49:31] <StromkoPenguin> You can stash stuff in the ship to free up space
[3:49:33] <%chiluzza> AUNTYMUTHER
[3:49:40] <Brother_Coduss> @AngriestPat isnt anti matter super explosive?
[3:49:47] <%rumtumtugnutz> UNCLEKRACKER
[3:49:48] <%Ranryu692> The correct pluralization is "cars bon"
[3:49:50] <+razielhex> Combine sulphurine and condensed carbon to create thermic condensate; create enriched carbon by combining condensed carbn with radon. Combine thermic condensate and enriched carbon to create organic catalyst. Combine organic catalyst with nitrogen salt (nitrogen and condensed carbon) to create a fusion accelerant. Sell for 2Million units.
[3:49:53] <%Zulrez> Isn’t that how other English speaking countries feel when they hear Americans speak English pat? Kappa
[3:49:54] <daisyyyy> CAR BON isvalid
[3:49:58] <zenith0111> What's up with the vignetting?
[3:50:01] <Renkage> Creepy blood tree. Nice
[3:50:02] <Monkeyweed21> Car bones
[3:50:04] <sparky77> @AngriestPat if you need to ditch something, ditch the nitrogen, you wont need it for a LONG time and by the time you do need it, youll be able to get more easily.
[3:50:06] <%yourliteraldog> You can make carbon dioxide from diamonds, then carbonate water.I saw a guy by the name of nilered on youtube do it.
[3:50:17] <OswaldTheDog> wow i come back to the stream and we talking science in the chat i love you people so much
[3:50:21] <VyperVic> @zenith0111 extreme heat
[3:50:53] <%ArtoriasTheTrenchfighter> Truly pat is the Digital Devolver we found along the way @zenith0111
[3:50:58] <+razielhex> now an antimatter holding unit
[3:51:01] <%Nina96> I come back to Pat talking about saying words wrong intentionally so thats fun and on brand i guess
[3:51:10] <%rumtumtugnutz> @yourliteraldog Then William Osman made a video where he drank it with iDubbbz, NileRed, and Peter Sripol and they all said it tasted like dirt.
[3:51:11] <+JOHNNYROCKETFlNGERS> Pat needs oxygen because his robot body happens to run on an electron transport chain
[3:51:12] <%Caped_Eggy> What?
[3:51:36] <daisyyyy> its not that antimatter is explosive, its that it will react with normal matter in an explosive way. by itself its just...matter, but anti
[3:51:49] <+razielhex> does he not have a scanner to rename the plants & rocks, or does he just not care?
[3:51:52] <%UltraViolet371> oh no, now that you pointed it out, the car-bons are really intense
[3:51:54] <+ChaosAethr> so this this game good now?
[3:51:57] <sparky77> yes
[3:51:58] <%T_Sasquatch> You're offending my ears
[3:52:06] <VyperVic> game good
[3:52:07] <%rumtumtugnutz> Yeah this game is pretty good now
[3:52:08] <RubberFistFight> @AngriestPat so is "pargon pargon pargon" getting replaced with "car-bonn car-bonn car-bonn"? Kappa
[3:52:11] <Fdrank> what if we tried "car bone"?
[3:52:11] <+ChaosAethr> great
[3:52:19] <Ipsenscastle> carbonne
[3:52:20] <%rumtumtugnutz> Well yeah
[3:52:28] <%rumtumtugnutz> You can't just carry around antimatter
[3:52:28] <ape_hawk> he just homer simpsond
[3:52:30] <+razielhex> if you get some A-class or S-Class scanner boosters you get like 50-300,000 units per scan
[3:52:30] <VyperVic> anti minor housing?
[3:52:31] <zenith0111> @artoriasthetrenchfighter apatLiz
[3:52:31] <%chiluzza> you cant have anti matter meet normal matter
[3:52:33] <DeebzNutz100> anti matter... it doesn't matter atpCap
[3:52:39] <%rumtumtugnutz> That's how you get warp core breaches.
[3:52:41] <%yourliteraldog> @rumtumtugnutz Did it taste like dirt nile was quite apt in saying carbon dioxide is just carbon dioxde. That said I want to drink it too
[3:52:43] <Ipsenscastle> I mean not if you want to explode violently
[3:52:45] <Renkage> Danm robo popo
[3:52:45] <Narukamiiii> Damn cops
[3:52:47] <%chiluzza> its like bringing your black partner to your racist thanksgiving
[3:52:59] <daisyyyy> that groan sounded like somone else it was weird
[3:53:03] <+JOHNNYROCKETFlNGERS> what an analogy
[3:53:07] <zenith0111> bunbeeShock
[3:53:09] <%floralkami> Pat is gonna get put on a watch list by the end of this session...
[3:53:28] <+JOHNNYROCKETFlNGERS> do you need more cop ore?
[3:53:35] <Ner234> @chiluzza I miss read your comment as Black Panther. I was VERY confused.
[3:53:39] <%TubeMan642> Hey Pat are you planning to stream Pokemon Mystery Dungeon DX
[3:53:42] <%rumtumtugnutz> I feel like he's probably gonna wind down soon and this'll be mostly a 'mindless shit for Pat' game.
[3:53:53] <%Zaphire_Saucypants> does he really need more of da pig ore?
[3:53:55] <Ipsenscastle> Letting matter touch antimatter is like having JJ Abrams make a sequel to your Rian Johnson film
[3:53:59] <+razielhex> looks like it's a hot one; keep that sodium stocked
[3:54:00] <+JOHNNYROCKETFlNGERS> I don't mind watching this game just for the vistas
[3:54:01] <+ROMSIL123> sweet Fresh play through HYPEr
[3:54:19] <zenith0111> You can make buildings now right?
[3:54:20] <%yourliteraldog> @chiluzza That's a good movie tho, is it a winter solider crowd?

[3:54:43] <%mield916> scanner
[3:54:46] <TheBadoe> It would explain the lack of animals
[3:54:47] <+Jordan276> use the scaner to find dangerous plants
[3:54:49] <%rumtumtugnutz> You got oxygen from the plants here before. Remember the ground teeth?
[3:55:02] <Renkage> @zenith0111 Yes btw. You can make a base
[3:55:07] <zenith0111> Just breathe Kappa
[3:55:10] <%Caped_Eggy> What about those green pumpkin looking things?
[3:55:14] <zenith0111> @renkage Cool
[3:55:19] <bluefooddye1> No oxygen, just salt, must have a high density of LoL players Kappa
[3:55:20] <%yourliteraldog> Find newplants to smoke and make into drugs
[3:55:21] <+razielhex> t for torch
[3:55:32] <Ipsenscastle> Suck the oxygen out of an unidentified plant
[3:55:34] <%michingmallecho> I wonder if you could drill all the way to the core of a planet
[3:55:35] <+razielhex> T FOR TORCH
[3:55:39] <%michingmallecho> SEAN MAKE IT HAPPEN
[3:56:10] <sparky77> some of those have sodium, some have oxygen
[3:56:27] <+Psych_man13_13> When he gets a freighter i hope he renames it to the Enterprise
[3:56:40] <%Caped_Eggy> Oh well
[3:56:47] <LyshRawr> Maybe you can just buy some at the station?
[3:56:52] <%yourliteraldog> Weird fungi
[3:56:52] <+Jordan276> he can
[3:57:08] <+razielhex> I've spent over 100hrs in NMS and have yet to leave my local star cluster
[3:57:23] <clueless_reaper> Thats nuts
[3:57:25] <Ipsenscastle> Salvaged Brent Spiner
[3:57:35] <PlumpPotatoRump> i like how the jetpack doesnt fuck about. You want to go up, Jetpack go up!!!
[3:57:39] <+ChaosAethr> can you scout the planet in your starship for oxygenor is your starship low on fuel
[3:57:49] <sparky77> theres gotta be oxygen somewhere, youve gotten it on this planet before
[3:57:56] <+razielhex> If you do a little hop and hold the jets down, you'll do a super-jump with the jetpack @PlumpPotatoRump
[3:57:59] <%Caped_Eggy> Man those things look like duck feet
[3:58:00] <FalseEyeD> Is this Dark Void? Kappa
[3:58:12] <Ipsenscastle> SPACE COWS
[3:58:14] <KalmVibrations> Jesus, that plant was running pretty hot
[3:58:15] <%yourliteraldog> Look a spacemoose
[3:58:16] <VyperVic> ooh animals
[3:58:19] <%mield916> isn't the blue crystal oxy?
[3:58:22] <zenith0111> Da rocks apatLiz
[3:58:27] <%yourliteraldog> Pat the spacemoose
[3:58:35] <+razielhex> need a class-A mining rifle
[3:58:35] <PlumpPotatoRump> @razielhex I'd totally betray the human race for a jetpack like that.
[3:58:38] <i_heart_gaming> This new death stranding update looks wild.
[3:58:43] <Ipsenscastle> What is wrong with you
[3:58:45] <%yourliteraldog> Rock HARD
[3:58:50] <%michingmallecho> Small dick energy
[3:58:51] <+Juggerlag> you have to get your rocks off
[3:58:56] <%GeneralSCPatton> THIS IS A STRAND GAME
[3:58:57] <+ROMSIL123> Urock
[3:59:01] <+Jordan276> didnt knew death stranding released in 2016
[3:59:04] <+razielhex> Until you get a freighter, this only has RUCKIN', it lacks TRUCKIN'
[3:59:08] <+barrakuta371> Really? On the rocks?
[3:59:19] <%yourliteraldog> Kill those spacecows for spacebeef to make spacesteak!
[3:59:22] <%aishman> Man that looks a bit tedious for me
[3:59:30] <%michingmallecho> Sean Murray created the strand genre apatPorgmo
[3:59:34] <Ipsenscastle> Don't let the shifty looking cow steal your credits
[3:59:35] <$abracadaver_675> abracadaver_675 subscribed with Twitch Prime. They've subscribed for 19 months! Yeet dab coward
[3:59:40] <Monkeyweed21> its alot easier to buy warp cells from now on
[3:59:41] <sparky77> you can only summon if it has fuel though so keep that in mind
[3:59:43] <+razielhex> Summoning your ship is great; it takes 20-25% of the fuel to do so
[3:59:44] <iheartmota> very nice
[3:59:48] <%Typhaeon> The Pyramidalorian
[3:59:51] <+ROMSIL123> it uses thrusters
[3:59:55] <$rytyoung> that's very handy
[3:59:57] <clueless_reaper> This is the way
[4:00:01] <bigarmsnolegs> are there planets in this game that actually have civilizations?
[4:00:02] <Ipsenscastle> blast off motherfucker
[4:00:04] <+ChaosAethr> enough for one trip
[4:00:06] <PlumpPotatoRump> loool
[4:00:10] <%Typhaeon> Also I started this game up again after a recent patch and the faction/language system was completely unrecognizable
[4:00:12] <zenith0111> This is like a narrative driven survival sandbox
[4:00:15] <+Jordan276> time for the galactic map
[4:00:18] <Ipsenscastle> smooth
[4:00:18] <Renkage> Good driver
[4:00:22] <+razielhex> I think a standard warp core is 4 jumps?
[4:00:24] <%UltraViolet371> *hyperdrive damaged*

[4:00:50] <%fruit_pie_the_magician> I THINK green stars are the best
[4:00:55] <%yourliteraldog> hehe I was waiting for the crash
[4:00:56] <KalmVibrations> Coming through
[4:01:01] <%michingmallecho> Remember when star citizen was suppose to release. I don’t either kaceyHEH kaceyHEH
[4:01:03] <Ipsenscastle> lol
[4:01:07] <+Jordan276> LUL
[4:01:13] <+razielhex> the dotted line is how you get to the center
[4:01:17] <+Jordan276> how many planets?
[4:01:18] <%ssjklyco> hey guys
[4:01:20] <%Shackle_Rustyford> gotta admit, im not a huge fan of how close the planets in a system appear to be to eachother
[4:01:25] <ape_hawk> isnt star citizen in early access or something?>
[4:01:29] <Saltmeisterr> make a base on Estus?
[4:01:29] <+razielhex> I think I saw 3 planets + 1 moon
[4:01:31] <%Shackle_Rustyford> maybe its just me but it kind of throws off any sense of immersion
[4:01:36] <Ipsenscastle> Stokin-Bent sounds like a northern English town
[4:01:38] <%Zaphire_Saucypants> does reaching the center still restart the game for you?
[4:01:40] <+321Continue> !uptime
[4:01:40] <@Moobot> I've been playing this game for how long? Oh only 4h 1m.
[4:01:42] <%Tearonex> YUP
[4:01:45] <%aishman> I think I just heard Pat break
[4:01:52] <%AncelDeLambert> Pat's just melting into his couch
[4:01:53] <%fruit_pie_the_magician> GREEN
[4:01:54] <Saltmeisterr> oh ni
[4:01:56] <%ssjklyco> you look like your brain exploded
[4:01:59] <grayjammer> That's the Pat Distress Noise
[4:02:03] <%AncelDeLambert> get BENT
[4:02:05] <Narukamiiii> Engage
[4:02:06] <+Jordan276> u can just move around if u press B
[4:02:09] <%Fatmanjoggin> VIDEOGAME
[4:02:10] <+razielhex> @Zaphire_Saucypants It warps you to another galaxy. There have been over 200 galaxies discovered so far, each with 18 Quintillion objects in them.
[4:02:12] <+ahdurian> uh oh Code Pat. Code Pat
[4:02:17] <%Tearonex> Had the same reaction when I first did this too
[4:02:21] <StromkoPenguin> I wish Spore had gotten this kind of post-release overhauling. Goddamn EA.
[4:02:24] <%Kiiper> Need a better drive
[4:02:24] <%UltraViolet371> hit B to free cam
[4:02:25] <%aishman> Because you have t it in Galactic Core
[4:02:27] <+Jordan276> because u have a shit hyperdrive
[4:02:33] <%AncelDeLambert> this feels like Elite Dangerous all over again
[4:02:40] <%fruit_pie_the_magician> GREEN STARS
[4:02:44] <sparky77> use the OTHER stick pat
[4:02:50] <+Juggerlag> also limited to jump range
[4:02:51] <%Kiiper> Galactic core is main path
[4:02:54] <Monkeyweed21> SPACE MOTHERFYCKER
[4:02:54] <%GeneralSCPatton> @angriestpat How long to get 100% on all worlds? *agitates the mind goblins* apatGoblin
[4:02:55] <$RenegadeHatter> All the stars in the sky are Warps
[4:02:55] <Ipsenscastle> Hey Pat, none of this matters, it's okay
[4:02:59] <+Alzack13> so is NMS proper good now? I've been pretty impressed with how the devs stuck with it but dunno how the game actually is
[4:03:00] <Narukamiiii> Its all randomized so just pick one
[4:03:04] <%startstoprepeat> it's really impressive until you realise every planet is basically the same
[4:03:05] <zenith0111> rmzSLAIN rmzSLAIN rmzSLAIN
[4:03:06] <+razielhex> @AncelDeLambert Elite Dangerous uses a 32bit seed, NMS was built from the ground up with a 64bit seed.
[4:03:13] <+Psych_man13_13> Pat, you dont need to explore the whole galaxy
[4:03:16] <%Zaphire_Saucypants> head splodey?
[4:03:16] <fusedforms> hit B
[4:03:23] <%Tearonex> TOO MUCH CHOICE?
[4:03:26] <%keyoray> Pat needs an Elmo.
[4:03:28] <+Jordan276> u need to hit b to free pick
[4:03:29] <%AncelDeLambert> I'm talking about how the 3D map is a nightmare to navigate
[4:03:32] <+ahdurian> @Psych_man13_13 his mind goblins say he needs to
[4:03:35] <%WarbossMetal> Exploring infinity might take a while
[4:03:37] <clueless_reaper> apatWhat apatWhat
[4:03:37] <Ipsenscastle> Just take it one objective at a time
[4:03:42] <+razielhex> OUR SUN WILL BURN OUT AND EXPLODE before a single galaxy in No Man's Sky would have ever been fully documented
[4:03:46] <%michingmallecho> you need more fuel to outrun the first order pat.
[4:03:47] <+Godjaw> Pretty sure it's impossible to explore the whole galaxy, there is always more, it never ends
[4:03:48] <%Zaphire_Saucypants> nothin like a good zombo head splode to combat da head splode
[4:03:51] <zenith0111> doodBigBrain doodBigBrain doodBigBrain doodBigBrain doodBigBrain doodBigBrain doodBigBrain doodBigBrain doodBigBrain doodBigBrain doodBigBrain doodBigBrain doodBigBrain doodBigBrain doodBigBrain
[4:03:52] <%Kiiper> It's literally infinite
