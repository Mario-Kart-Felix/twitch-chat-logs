[0:56:01] <Oxybe> bork!
[0:56:04] <%sweetestbeefs> he BORK
[0:56:07] <Gruhunchously> So remember that droid at the beginning that the Ithorians lost?
[0:56:08] <Too_Much_Nukie> The dark side version of the enclave isn't as good lol.
[0:56:22] <%Puhff> He's a droid; not a person.
[0:56:23] <Gruhunchously> It was him.
[0:56:31] <%sweetestbeefs> he's a fucked up ai
[0:56:34] <tukds> because
[0:56:35] <Too_Much_Nukie> @patstaresat Go-To was a Republic AI designed to fix their economy and security.
[0:56:35] <%RedSqurrl> TA DAAAAA
[0:56:40] <%sweetestbeefs> he wasnt originally evil
[0:56:42] <Gruhunchously> He wasn't evil at first
[0:56:42] <%VHGS> they're dumb
[0:56:43] <Daxalog> He wasnt evil
[0:56:44] <%JoshManVGH> cause lawls
[0:56:48] <%krispen_wa> he broke because he was supposed to save the republic while NOT breaking their laws
[0:56:49] <+megaman_sentinel> he broke
[0:56:57] <%GarbageQueenEllie> I knew that bastard wasn't real
[0:57:00] <Too_Much_Nukie> Go-To went insane and turned into a criminal because he realized his parameters were impossible.
[0:57:05] <sweetestbeefs> he was supposed to "save the republic" but that task was impossible so his programming broke
[0:57:07] <%psidefx> They programmed him wrong, as a joke
[0:57:20] <+welly_____> @PatStaresAt  I love your balls.
[0:57:28] <%RedSqurrl> Just a prank bro
[0:57:39] <+welly_____> geeez i hope they mae anothe of these

[1:00:22] <+shadic7700> Tree beats the Exile
[1:00:26] <%sweetestbeefs> @welly_____ at least on his yt channel, the audio got really choppy at this part
[1:00:28] <+welly_____> wow .. was this mo capped?
[1:00:29] <%krispen_wa> why does she sit if she's gonna get up in like a minute
[1:00:31] <%dekkitout> psaGib PopCorn
[1:00:45] <Gruhunchously> She's old, she needs to rest
[1:00:49] <%GarbageQueenEllie> Remember this room from K1?
[1:00:53] <+welly_____> @sweetestbeefs  last i heard wolie was doing a blog?? is he ok?
[1:01:05] <+welly_____> @sweetestbeefs  i saw hi mreal lif once.. was starstruck
[1:01:06] <Oxybe> space gout in the knees?
[1:01:13] <+krispen_wa> yoy literally killed everyone dumbass
[1:01:19] <+megaman_sentinel> this music is really good
[1:01:21] <%BinaryFireball> yaaaayyy
[1:01:28] <%krispen_wa> ALL OF THEM?!
[1:01:37] <Too_Much_Nukie> This is what is left Pat.
[1:01:52] <+welly_____> sorry. who did we kill???
[1:01:53] <Valentinius_Anodyne> Congratulations. you did it
[1:02:09] <Too_Much_Nukie> We killed all the jedi masters.
[1:02:20] <+megaman_sentinel> they shou!d make a movie about her
[1:02:21] <Consumanist> you should be proud, just don't put it on your resume
[1:02:29] <%krispen_wa> why is pat's camera different?
[1:02:30] <%baka_sugoi> R E V E N G E
[1:02:41] <%dekkitout> Echo- drink
[1:02:55] <+welly_____> @krispen_wa  pat looks like he lsot weight.
[1:04:04] <Consumanist> show me on this doll were the force touched you
[1:04:44] <+welly_____> @Consumanist  ahaha
[1:04:55] <Gruhunchously> I love this concept, about how mass death leaves actual wounds in the force that can be felt.
[1:05:05] <rumtumtugnutz> @krispen_wa Pat reverses the camera when he's on the right now so it looks like he's looking at the game instead of the chat cause he has brain orcs.
[1:05:13] <+maenos2> this isn't as impactful withoutthe whole face the council thing
[1:05:45] <+maenos2> woonz
[1:05:53] <%W1nterTitan> You forgot to tweet you were live
[1:05:57] <+Dova573> Wouldnt this mean every planet destroyed by the death star left force wounds too\
[1:05:58] <%dekkitout> Five "echoes" in and something tells me I need a bigger glass...
[1:06:02] <+maenos2> haha
[1:06:02] <+Dova573> ?
[1:06:30] <Gruhunchously> I mean, Obi-was able to feel the destruction of Alderaan across the galaxy
[1:06:39] <$Dakuu75> I'm fucking lsot now
[1:06:47] <%dekkitout> @Dova573 It really should, too bad Lucas didn't do that 40 years ago
[1:06:52] <+gustavozxd> 10 seconds of being here and I hear the word "echo"
[1:07:20] <%sweetestbeefs> Canonical explanation for influence, yay!
[1:07:27] <Valentinius_Anodyne> Yeah, this plot point feels like a natural evolution of Obi-Wan feeling the destruction of Alderaan from so far away

[1:08:47] <%BinaryFireball> wow she is still talking
[1:09:03] <%GarbageQueenEllie> She's SO disappointed.
[1:09:04] <%sweetestbeefs> you learned how to suck the life out of people
[1:09:07] <+megaman_sentinel> why can't the movies have this type of dialog
[1:09:09] <Zebroneath> she disappointed
[1:09:10] <+chance_h> lectures and jedi go hand in hand
[1:09:10] <mayormanders> blah blah blah
[1:09:21] <%AncelDeLambert> I think it's safe to say that Karen is a total failure in Kreia's eyes
[1:09:31] <Too_Much_Nukie> I love this because you can't rest
[1:09:46] <Consumanist> dead is the next best thing
[1:09:48] <Too_Much_Nukie> You don't get a conversation option to go back at this point.
[1:10:00] <%krispen_wa> kreia: yo, you fucking suck ass bro
[1:10:16] <$Dakuu75> "don't worry about it"

[1:10:56] <%sweetestbeefs> I LEARNED IT FROM WATCHING YOU MOM
[1:10:58] <Gruhunchously> I love that Kreia is just...yeah you fucking suck
[1:10:59] <Consumanist> the force told me to do it
[1:11:04] <%dekkitout> THE CAUCACITY OF YOUR HUBRIS, KAE'RYN
[1:11:05] <$Dakuu75> salty-old-bitch
[1:11:06] <%AncelDeLambert> "Holy crap, why did I pull you off that rock of a mining station?"
[1:11:14] <+chance_h> -10 points to griffondor
[1:11:28] <%GarbageQueenEllie> Holy shit this monologue
[1:11:33] <%krispen_wa> "You dumb bitch"
[1:11:36] <%AncelDeLambert> "You have been taught every lesson, and chosen to learn nothing"
[1:11:38] <+megaman_sentinel> failure
[1:11:40] <reonome> F

[1:12:11] <%dekkitout> Commit spitepuku
[1:12:15] <%BinaryFireball> sympathetic magic motherfucker
[1:12:15] <%GarbageQueenEllie> That was fucking awesome
[1:12:16] <%sweetestbeefs> YEAH CALLBACKS
[1:12:16] <%BakiinPlaysStuff> I forgot about the whole connection thing and thought she just offed herself because she thinks your cringe darkside
[1:12:16] <%AncelDeLambert> oh
[1:12:17] <%Daxalog> Prrrt
[1:12:20] <%krispen_wa> God, this is why I can never do a DS playthrough
[1:12:21] <+megaman_sentinel> encore!!!!
[1:12:21] <Zebroneath> she shrug's it off while you take it like a bitch
[1:12:24] <%AncelDeLambert> maaaaaan, I was hoping that'd be a Game Over screen
[1:12:31] <%krispen_wa> I can never disappoint granny
[1:12:32] <Aydarkzero> oh
[1:12:37] <SoaringTrumpet> hardcore
[1:12:39] <%sweetestbeefs> nope!
[1:12:42] <+megaman_sentinel> that's Oscar Worthy
[1:12:44] <%BinaryFireball> can you say you're sorry?
[1:12:46] <%Trenr> I don't think so
[1:12:52] <%GarbageQueenEllie> I doubt it
[1:12:53] <%sweetestbeefs> she's always dissapointed.
[1:12:56] <Too_Much_Nukie> Nope, you've fallen.
[1:12:56] <Gruhunchously> Pretty sure there isn't
[1:12:59] <rosemon5001> well this is something that happened only 2 in the whole of star wars here and in the clone wars animated series whit the father and son @PatStaresAt
[1:13:00] <+Delenay> or you could just not assume shell die on her own and kill the player character... coward moral high ground
[1:13:04] <Too_Much_Nukie> At this point you are a failure.
[1:13:10] <mayormanders> wish she wouldve started with that instead of the whole speech beforehand
[1:13:16] <%Mrbaconator> RAD
[1:13:17] <%dekkitout> It's Kreia, she's malcontent personified
[1:13:21] <KaiserMario> You had to spare and bring the Masters here so she's mad at them instead
[1:13:23] <Valentinius_Anodyne> Man, I love the dialogue in this game. For as much as Obsidian may struggle with game production, their writing is consistently great
[1:13:27] <%sweetestbeefs> you sniffed a little too much of that dark side paint bro
[1:13:27] <%GarbageQueenEllie> Oh fuck off Mica
[1:13:29] <%RedSqurrl> Light Side version more rad. But it's def interesting to see Dark Side version
[1:13:33] <%AncelDeLambert> no-one cares, Disciple, shut up
[1:13:43] <Too_Much_Nukie> This stuff is restored content.
[1:13:47] <Gruhunchously> I know you can hear my thoughts Karen
[1:13:52] <%Mrbaconator> not as rad as murdering everyone through the force
[1:13:55] <%krispen_wa> Everyone giving weird light side speeches even on a DS playthrough
[1:13:55] <+Ruddagger> God I hate Bao-dur's voice acting
[1:13:56] <%sweetestbeefs> fuck disciple, all my homies hate disciple
[1:13:59] <+Ruddagger> ASMR nightmare
[1:13:59] <%AncelDeLambert> Bao, you ain't gettin that puss
[1:14:04] <%Mrbaconator> karen wants to speak to the forces manager
[1:14:08] <rosemon5001> i love how this has monster noises in the background for ambience
[1:14:11] <+shadic7700> Man why didn’t  HK just shoot granny from a bush
[1:14:13] <$SGrim> The disciple continues to suck
[1:14:17] <+SilverDevilfish> Force Win Button achieved
[1:14:18] <%JohnAtDawn> The game is talking down to you
[1:14:26] <Zebroneath> ye
[1:14:29] <+megaman_sentinel> yes
[1:14:33] <Gruhunchously> Yeah, you are a Force Vampire
[1:14:35] <%justcallmebobplease> Charisma singularity
[1:14:39] <BlueLunecy> Kreia revealed the final truth. She IS the manager
[1:14:45] <OperatorJo_> yeh
[1:14:46] <+ARandom0wl> pretty much
[1:14:48] <Too_Much_Nukie> Not unique, but rare.
[1:14:50] <Nix_Abyss> yeah Revan and the Exile are like that
[1:14:50] <%krispen_wa> The vase in the corner
[1:14:52] <%dekkitout> Everyone seems to be your phylacteries/horcruxes
[1:14:54] <Nix_Abyss> thats like the whole point
[1:14:55] <+megaman_sentinel> chest
[1:15:06] <%krispen_wa> big empty room
[1:15:11] <%sweetestbeefs> yeah, it's why people like handmaiden will still attack innocents depiste being hard light side people
[1:15:15] <Gruhunchously> You dragged all of them down to the dark side with you
[1:15:16] <%justcallmebobplease> Naw they can't learn the hungry without the trauma
[1:15:18] <%JohnAtDawn> Noooooo?
[1:15:19] <Zebroneath> almost bordering on puppeting them
[1:15:20] <%AncelDeLambert> ... I dunno if that's it
[1:15:21] <%dekkitout> Oh right, Spiral Nemesis
[1:15:22] <Valentinius_Anodyne> Indeed
[1:15:24] <%Trenr> like a sort of reverse pyramid scheme
[1:15:26] <+EmptyMug> You could kill the force itself
[1:15:29] <+megaman_sentinel> yes
[1:15:36] <%GarbageQueenEllie> You've essentially killed the entire universe, yes
[1:15:39] <%sweetestbeefs> no, they're scared of you becoming nihilus 2.0
[1:15:42] <%AncelDeLambert> I think the fear is that you will CHOOSE to swallow The Force
[1:15:46] <%justcallmebobplease> They ARE getting juiced from the force bond with the force black hole that is you, I think
[1:15:56] <Gruhunchously> @PatStaresAt If you attack people with light side party members with you, they will sitll follow you and freak out about why their doing so.
[1:15:57] <Too_Much_Nukie> @patstaresat You formed connections with your soldiers during the Mandalorian Wars and when Malachor V happened and you ordered those men to their deaths, you effectively tore your soul into pieces.
[1:15:59] <%krispen_wa> You're a black hole. you succ everything. and eventually you may teach other people to succ. and then the universe is succd
[1:16:02] <%JohnAtDawn> The Exile's afliction is unique.
[1:16:02] <Gruhunchously> *innocent people
[1:16:02] <%sweetestbeefs> because eventually you'll suck up the entire universe if you're left unchecked
[1:16:02] <+gitgouda> oh no what if it was some sort of super rare armor
[1:16:07] <AVkid_> clicked this and heard "kill everybody"... I'm in
[1:16:07] <+ARandom0wl> light side is better in my opinion
[1:16:14] <%dekkitout> Kreia chews THE FUCK out of the council
[1:16:21] <+Exicuren> You are kinda like Nihilus
[1:16:22] <%AncelDeLambert> the same, it's still the fear that you'll slippery slope down to eating the universe
[1:16:23] <%GarbageQueenEllie> The Masters try to cut you off, and Kreia STOMPS them
[1:16:31] <Zebroneath> Light side is the council tries to cut you off/kill you and Kreia is, "you fucking idiots"
[1:16:33] <%Daxalog> In the light side they all show up and kreia gravity squeezes them while ranting
[1:16:34] <%RedSqurrl> ^
[1:16:41] <%krispen_wa> The Masters tell you about your condition, but then decide that you might become a nihilus, then try to cut you off
[1:16:42] <Too_Much_Nukie> @patstaresat The jedi try to execute you and Kreia freaks out that they would destroy you before acknowledging they are wrong.
[1:16:44] <+megaman_sentinel> somewhat
[1:16:46] <+chance_h> like a domino set of souls
[1:16:53] <%AncelDeLambert> ah, okay, Ligth Side is OTHER PEOPLE turning you into a giant mouth
[1:16:54] <%krispen_wa> kreia saves you and tells them they're dumbasses
[1:17:14] <reonome> wow everyone looks really crusty
[1:17:18] <Too_Much_Nukie> As a light side your condition is not a problem. The jedi think it could be so they try to kill you out of fear.
[1:17:18] <+ARandom0wl> the music sekiroGasm

[1:17:30] <+gitgouda> his face tho
[1:17:49] <+EmptyMug> The Jedi council considers you a threat and attempts to strip you of the force, yet by doing so will guarantee Nihlius's victory
[1:17:50] <Pillagius> Aton is so wrinkly that it looks like he has a beard...
[1:17:50] <%Pappajimbo> im shocked SHOCKED. well not that shocked
[1:17:52] <+KaitoJinn> Are... are we the baddies? D:

[1:18:12] <LyriumSmuggler> this guy
[1:18:12] <Valentinius_Anodyne> LEAVE US
[1:18:12] <sweetestbeefs> GO AWAY CRINGE LORD
[1:18:13] <+Ruddagger> ahahahahaha
[1:18:15] <%krispen_wa> Install the mod that lets you fuck Visas instead
[1:18:17] <%RedSqurrl> LOL
[1:18:24] <ABakedDemon> I completely forgot about this dude
[1:18:28] <+crazyspartan214> LOL
[1:18:31] <+welly_____> they ar getting aids.
[1:18:37] <%sweetestbeefs> also yeah that was supposed to be a "romance" scene
[1:18:41] <Gruhunchously> Yeah you could have fucked Visas in that scene, but you go this guy instead
[1:18:42] <%AncelDeLambert> Disciple is why I ALWAYS play male
[1:18:53] <%AncelDeLambert> he is so BORING
[1:18:55] <%GarbageQueenEllie> I love how you just tell him to fuck off and it just HARD CUTS
[1:19:00] <%JoshManVGH> so he went and snitched
[1:19:00] <+megaman_sentinel> can u get him to go dark side
[1:19:03] <%sweetestbeefs> HANDMAIDEN IS SO MUCH BETTER THO!
[1:19:03] <%Mr_Pylon> He's walking melba toast
[1:19:04] <%RedSqurrl> Atton ftw
[1:19:10] <Gruhunchously> But canon also has the Handmaiden travelling with the Exile
[1:19:15] <%krispen_wa> PartySwap Mod FTW
[1:19:17] <%Daxalog> "I have a headache"
[1:19:21] <Gruhunchously> You you techinally can't do a canon run without mods
[1:19:22] <%W1nterTitan> If she was gay, there would be no problems
[1:19:24] <%Vyskus> handmaiden is better plot wise AND mechanic wise. the feat you get from her is so good
[1:19:29] <Too_Much_Nukie> @patstaresat The canon is female Exile but handmaiden and disciple BOTH join
[1:19:35] <%krispen_wa> The last of the Karens
[1:19:40] <Aydarkzero> are we about to watch two old ladies fight
[1:19:44] <+megaman_sentinel> dis bitch
[1:19:51] <Valentinius_Anodyne> Yeah, it's kinda odd how Lady Exile is canon, but Guy Exile has more interesting writing with some of the party
[1:19:59] <Gruhunchously> Yeah that' a bit weird
[1:20:00] <%Daxalog> Gaso
[1:20:00] <%GarbageQueenEllie> Wait, WHAT
[1:20:02] <%Alazull> @PatStaresAt For what it's worth I think the reason female Exile is canon is because of the Revan book. That was commissioned by Bioware, so maybe they chose the worst one on purpose?
[1:20:02] <Valentinius_Anodyne> Yeyeye
[1:20:04] <%sweetestbeefs> it was me, ATRIS! IT WAS ME ALL ALONG!
[1:20:08] <%AncelDeLambert> I don't think you hear this in a Light run
[1:20:10] <%dekkitout> IT'S ME ATRIS!
[1:20:11] <CursedNobleman> Darth 'TRAYA LUL
[1:20:11] <%krispen_wa> That line about her causing the exile was cut for a reason
[1:20:15] <%krispen_wa> it makes no sense
[1:20:33] <NitronStreams> TRAITOR
[1:20:34] <%krispen_wa> you do hear this in a light run
[1:20:35] <Gruhunchously> Yeah that line feels like it was actually cut for a reason, because it doen'st make any sense.
[1:20:37] <CursedNobleman> suprised sucka'?! you just got rolled by darth TRAYA'! LUL
[1:20:47] <%JohnAtDawn> A lot about this game's plot makes no sense
[1:20:48] <%dekkitout> You bought it. The council bought it! Even the Exile bought it!
[1:20:48] <%JoshManVGH> This Darth be TRAYA!?
[1:20:49] <%AncelDeLambert> okay, THIS part is important, tho
[1:20:52] <%GarbageQueenEllie> Yeah, wasn't Kreia exiled long before the mc?
[1:20:54] <%JohnAtDawn> Especially the last act
[1:21:02] <%sweetestbeefs> yeah, the whole "kreia caused you to be an exile" thing here is kinda dumb
[1:21:10] <OperatorJo_> Darth beTraya NotLikeThis
[1:21:27] <+welly_____> She still facing away
[1:21:44] <+welly_____> @PatStaresAt  whats happening here?
[1:21:46] <%AncelDeLambert> the writers are trying a little too hard to turn Kreia into Xanatos here
[1:21:47] <%JohnAtDawn> There are times in this game where you can really tell the guy who wrote it hated Star Wars at the time.
[1:21:51] <OperatorJo_> for dramatic purposes of course.
[1:22:06] <Gruhunchously> @JohnAtDawn How's that?
[1:22:14] <+megaman_sentinel> not even facing her so good
[1:22:14] <%krispen_wa> ECHOES drink
[1:22:16] <%GarbageQueenEllie> It was your THIRST
[1:22:18] <Ipsenscastle> you can't use the word 'turbolasers' in an emotional speech
[1:22:22] <rosemon5001> revans force ghost is like NO GIANT FACTORYS UNDERGROUND NOPE NOPE
[1:22:31] <%krispen_wa> ITS THE LINE
[1:22:33] <%AncelDeLambert> inches from turning a Xanatos Gambit into Roulette
[1:22:34] <%krispen_wa> THE GOOD LINE
[1:22:40] <$JohnAtDawn> That line is good though
[1:22:41] <+ARandom0wl> she said the thing :O
[1:22:42] <%dekkitout> "Congratulations, you 'trayed yaself"
[1:22:45] <JoshManVGH> I was going to ask why, if Kreia is hard dark side, why doesn't she look broken as shit. but I've decided that she's in her early 30s
[1:22:47] <%sweetestbeefs> @JohnAtDawn and he wrote arguably the best star wars story because of it LUL
[1:22:58] <%AncelDeLambert> ... younglings
[1:23:04] <%JohnAtDawn> Very arguably
[1:23:05] <+megaman_sentinel> she's the real Karen
[1:23:12] <CursedNobleman> get 'TRAYED LUL
[1:23:12] <+krispen_wa> Not having Handmaiden here is soooooo alward
[1:23:15] <%krispen_wa> *awkward
[1:23:19] <+ARandom0wl> weee wooooo
[1:23:22] <%toolofparanoia> WEE WOO WW WOO
[1:23:29] <Too_Much_Nukie> @joshmanvgh But she's not dark side. She was with once but she has never been a dark Sider.
[1:23:37] <Too_Much_Nukie> *Sith once
[1:23:50] <%psidefx> She just standing there ....psaMenace psaMenace psaMenace psaMenace
[1:23:51] <+welly_____> @krispen_wa  explainthe hand maiden thing?
[1:23:51] <Gruhunchously> Yeah, the other Handmaidens just kind of disappear
[1:23:53] <%cylish> @JoshManVGH shes sorta neutral at this point and when you get to her goal itll make sense why
[1:24:03] <rosemon5001> WEEE WOOO murder police her you have evaded your death thats wrong
[1:24:24] <%Vyskus> kreia is like extreme neutral to the point of it being detrimental and cold rather than practical
[1:24:25] <Too_Much_Nukie> You can be a sith without relying on the dark side of the force.
[1:24:28] <%krispen_wa> @welly_____ this is where handmaiden returns and completes her character arc by fighting against Atris. without handmaiden it just kind feels weird
[1:24:38] <%sweetestbeefs> oh man you really just walk through the facility with no fighting
[1:24:40] <%dork_doggler> I like how all the movies are like "ambiguity and nuance does not exist in this setting, if something has it it's not canon"
[1:24:46] <%moonmintparadise> Red Lightsaber so she must be evil now
[1:24:48] <%krispen_wa> Kreia is the closest thing to Grey sith
[1:24:51] <%abusywizard> abusywizard subscribed at Tier 1. They've subscribed for 8 months, currently on a 2 month streak! hey there pat, hope you're having a grand ol' time with da sith lords. it makes me super happy seeing more people realize the big power of the big evil
[1:24:51] <+welly_____> @krispen_wa  Ooooh
[1:25:00] <%krispen_wa> Did you really skip her long infodump?
[1:25:04] <GustauveVIII> feels weird being here without handmaiden :x
[1:25:08] <+welly_____> woah crush is stron
[1:25:13] <%GarbageQueenEllie> WOAH
[1:25:16] <+gitgouda> @moonmintparadise yes ignore all the sith holocrons
[1:25:17] <%dekkitout> Let's just skim over how she has a library of Sith podcasts on shuffle...
[1:25:19] <%Nekros4442> Get fucked
[1:25:21] <%vivaldiva> Kreygasm
[1:25:21] <+megaman_sentinel> so broken
[1:25:22] <Valentinius_Anodyne> Okay :)
[1:25:23] <%sweetestbeefs> crush is easy mode LUL
[1:25:26] <SoaringTrumpet> damn powerful
[1:25:26] <+gitgouda> its the lightsaber
[1:25:29] <rosemon5001> man these fights would go even faster if the goblins would allow pat to use the many drugs
[1:25:29] <%AncelDeLambert> FUCK YOU MOOOOOM!
[1:25:30] <%krispen_wa> Wow he really skipped her whole demented infodump
[1:25:32] <Yakobro> LUL
[1:25:33] <%Daxalog> Oh
[1:25:33] <%krispen_wa> thats funny
[1:25:36] <+ARandom0wl> crush is the most broken thing for final battle i never use it lol
[1:25:38] <+shadic7700> FAK that’s strong
[1:25:40] <%psidefx> rippo
[1:25:41] <OperatorJo_> amazing
[1:25:42] <%Daxalog> It looked like she was going to do a cool finisher
[1:25:44] <GustauveVIII> had the option of leaving her with the sith holocrons driving her crazy
[1:25:44] <%sweetestbeefs> man, you really didnt want to hear her talk LUL
[1:25:57] <%moonmintparadise> tbh i really tought you would just UNLIMITED POWER her
[1:26:15] <+welly_____> thats shade
[1:26:21] <%Mr_Pylon> Kreia was a pyrmaid scheme all along?
[1:26:25] <rosemon5001> how old are you bitch dang not a GILF more like a GGILF
[1:26:30] <%psidefx> that angle
[1:26:30] <+welly_____> lawl!
[1:26:48] <%dekkitout> Sink or swim nerd!
[1:26:54] <ABakedDemon> I wonder if nihlus is as hard as I remember as a kid it's been that long
[1:26:54] <+welly_____> i tihnk the game leans on Kreia pretty hard.
[1:26:55] <%krispen_wa> Kreia literally called him a fucking failure and still tries to test him? how tsundere
[1:26:57] <rosemon5001> the shit talking pyramids
[1:27:01] <%psidefx> final destination no items fox only
[1:27:03] <%GarbageQueenEllie> (Scary Ethnic Noises)
[1:27:03] <%sweetestbeefs> oh man that wide angle
[1:27:10] <%krispen_wa> @abakeddemon nihilus has never been hard
[1:27:28] <%sweetestbeefs> and away we go!
[1:27:36] <%Daxalog> Welcome to planet XBOX
[1:27:38] <%moonmintparadise> cookie crisp cutscenes just like mama used to make them
[1:27:41] <Valentinius_Anodyne> Okay that was fun bye :)
[1:27:45] <+crazyspartan214> wait what about the handmaiden?
[1:27:47] <Gruhunchously> Well, that was Atris guys
[1:27:47] <+KaitoJinn> I like how the holocrons are just fucking left there
[1:27:51] <%krispen_wa> OH NO NOT THE FACTORY
[1:27:51] <+KaitoJinn> For anyone to find
[1:27:53] <+Kingtut9009> Well that was anticlimactic
[1:27:57] <%sweetestbeefs> in and out, 10 minute adventure!
[1:28:01] <+welly_____> god that star destroyer looks like shit
[1:28:02] <+shadic7700> Meanwhile Revan is out there having a ball in deep space
[1:28:06] <%dork_doggler> @KaitoJinn what else would you do with them
[1:28:08] <%W1nterTitan> what's left of it
[1:28:11] <ABakedDemon> @krispen_wa I figured it was just me being a kid and not understanding how to beat him easily lmao
[1:28:18] <%krispen_wa> The amount of content you can skip as pure DS is fucking funny
[1:28:23] <%Mr_Pylon> Beeeeeeeee
[1:28:25] <rosemon5001> ahh yea the ship held up only by force juice
[1:28:26] <+gitgouda> 2 seconds of clip
[1:28:26] <Valentinius_Anodyne> Darth Kae'Ryn just completes a dungeon crawl on her coffee break
[1:28:30] <%sweetestbeefs> look at all of these loading screens
[1:28:31] <+crazyspartan214> What about the Handmaiden?
[1:28:34] <+gitgouda> worth the data space
[1:28:38] <+krispen_wa> ITS TIME
[1:28:38] <%Mr_Pylon> uhhh
[1:28:40] <%psidefx> HK THYME
[1:28:42] <%krispen_wa> THE WORST PART OF THE GAME
[1:28:45] <%GarbageQueenEllie> It was HERE
[1:28:46] <+Midashu> MEANWHILE
[1:28:47] <%sweetestbeefs> welcome to the factory!
[1:28:47] <%AncelDeLambert> TIME FOR CUT CONTENT!
[1:28:48] <+gitgouda> hk lets go
[1:28:48] <%Daxalog> Equipment check
[1:28:49] <Zebroneath> HK Factory time
[1:28:49] <+shadic7700> WOO
[1:28:50] <Valentinius_Anodyne> oh no
[1:28:55] <Gruhunchously> MEANWHILE
[1:28:55] <+Whiskey_T_Foxtrot> the meatbags must pay
[1:28:59] <%Vyskus> lmao what a shift
[1:29:01] <GustauveVIII> no backsies pat
[1:29:01] <saraizarai> nani the fuck
[1:29:02] <+gitgouda> time for THE FACTORY
[1:29:06] <%dekkitout> Oh boy- time for a lesson on why cut content is sometimes CUT. CONTENT.
[1:29:07] <GustauveVIII> lol no hes not
[1:29:07] <%krispen_wa> lol no he wont
[1:29:07] <Too_Much_Nukie> RESTORED CONTENT
[1:29:10] <Ipsenscastle> Is the restored content even actually worth it, really?
[1:29:14] <%AncelDeLambert> yeah but this is cut content, Pat, who said it had to make sense?
[1:29:19] <Gruhunchously> no he isn't
[1:29:22] <OldManDeckardCain> get owned kid LUL
[1:29:22] <%RedSqurrl> He won't beeee XD <3
[1:29:23] <+ARandom0wl> this side mission has one really good dialogue in it
[1:29:23] <rosemon5001> enjoy the factory
[1:29:24] <Consumanist> he is the ravager
[1:29:32] <GustauveVIII> @PatStaresAt you're forced to have two specific companions with you on the ravager
[1:29:37] <%sweetestbeefs> so cool thing, bao dur is dead now! yeah, they didn't tell you but apparently he died on the way to the hk factory to help HK destroy the replicas!
[1:29:41] <%krispen_wa> You may want to switch to easy for this
[1:29:44] <NitronStreams> Oh man this is great
[1:29:45] <+Ruddagger> when I played this, I found it next to impossible and had to just run past enemies
[1:29:50] <%dork_doggler> are hk's elcor
[1:29:52] <+welly_____> revans droids her t okick ass
[1:29:54] <%krispen_wa> LUL
[1:29:56] <Consumanist> HK does the ravaging around here
[1:30:00] <+EmptyMug> It's unclear
[1:30:02] <Yakobro> LUL
[1:30:03] <%krispen_wa> YUUUUP
[1:30:03] <Zebroneath> Yeah, he's dead
[1:30:05] <CursedNobleman> who? LUL
[1:30:06] <%cylish> its part of cut content, he gone
[1:30:06] <%Daxalog> Bao dur just dosnt show up anymore. Or is referenced
[1:30:06] <%sweetestbeefs> wish i was kidding.
[1:30:08] <$SGrim> Bao-dead KEKW
[1:30:08] <%GarbageQueenEllie> @sweetestbeefs rofl if that's true I'm gonna die laughing
[1:30:09] <%dekkitout> Yep, he's just spontaneously gone
[1:30:11] <+EmotionalFatGuy> but but who will call you general
[1:30:11] <KaiserMario> Very unclear
[1:30:15] <Ipsenscastle> LUL that's hilarious
[1:30:17] <+crazyspartan214> yup LUL
[1:30:18] <Gruhunchously> Well he's certainly missing
[1:30:18] <DexteraXIII> Yep
[1:30:18] <Valentinius_Anodyne> In the original he just disappears yeah
[1:30:19] <%emperordread> Poochie literally died on the way back to his home planet
[1:30:20] <Too_Much_Nukie> Yeah that's in the base game too.
[1:30:22] <Ids560> he needed to go, his home planet needed him
[1:30:22] <%AncelDeLambert> THANKS BIOWARE, NOT A DICK MOVE TOWARDS OBSIDIAN AT ALL
[1:30:25] <TheGunrunner91> yuppp
[1:30:28] <+Whiskey_T_Foxtrot> he got the poochie treatment
[1:30:31] <+ARandom0wl> @Ruddagger i played this on hard mode and it was physicly impossible to do anything other then run past everything
[1:30:33] <Too_Much_Nukie> in canon he sacrifices himself in this factory, not on the way.
[1:30:33] <Gruhunchously> He had to go, his planet needed him
[1:30:34] <+Exicuren> He went back to his planet
[1:30:35] <%RedSqurrl> I wouldn't say dead, but you ain't seeing him for the rest of the game, yeah lol
[1:30:36] <%sweetestbeefs> he's not DEAD dead, but he's gone from the game @PatStaresAt
[1:30:37] <+welly_____> wait bao dur just dssipears? @sweetestbeefs
[1:30:42] <%AncelDeLambert> what is WITH companies hiring Obsidian and then giving them NO TIME?
[1:30:47] <+NopeBadguy> bao dur died on his way back to his home planet
[1:30:47] <%krispen_wa> its not bioware. it was lucasart's fault
[1:30:48] <+crazyspartan214> F for Bao DDur
[1:30:54] <Too_Much_Nukie> @anceldelambert To be fair, Obsidian got offered an extension and they didn't take it.
[1:30:54] <KaiserMario> What's up with Paige? She making coffee?
[1:31:03] <%toolofparanoia> I HAVE TO GO NOW. MY PLANET NEEDS ME
[1:31:04] <TheFramedWarlock> His actor got cancelled on Twitter
[1:31:06] <Too_Much_Nukie> Obsidian literally said no to more time.
[1:31:08] <%GarbageQueenEllie> When will they learn to give devs time and money???
[1:31:26] <%krispen_wa> Jeezus fucking christ Obsidian what is with your management
[1:31:27] <TheFramedWarlock> Never LUL
[1:31:27] <Ipsenscastle> @AncelDeLambert more likely Obsidian just repeatedly promise impossible timescales
[1:31:43] <KaiserMario> @PatStaresAt Kyle Bosman hated Bao-Dur because he sounded like he had his mouth full of soup while talking
[1:31:43] <OldManDeckardCain> more like, what's with obsidian not knowing how to schedule their own  time and trying to be more ambitious than they can
[1:32:05] <%krispen_wa> NEW VEGAS? BUGGED NEW VEGAS?
[1:32:05] <%dork_doggler> Outer Worlds
[1:32:05] <%sweetestbeefs> both fallout and kotor 2 were less than a year of development
[1:32:06] <CursedNobleman> NV GOAT
[1:32:11] <Ids560> I mean new vegas is pretty buggy
[1:32:16] <Valentinius_Anodyne> I mean, even when Obsidian does have time they can still get overwhelmed. Their management is funky like that
[1:32:16] <%GarbageQueenEllie> They really need better team management. Someone who knows how to tell time.
[1:32:17] <%AncelDeLambert> @Ipsenscastle they were given 14 months
[1:32:18] <%dekkitout> Even still, New Vegas comes with asterisks
[1:32:25] <Ipsenscastle> New Vegas is pretty fucking compromised though
[1:32:27] <TheGunrunner91> Alpha Protocol is the best obsidian game
[1:32:28] <%toolofparanoia> Fallout is buggy in general
[1:32:31] <%sweetestbeefs> eh, you can tell they ran out of time if you do the legion story
[1:32:33] <Zebroneath> New Vegas, despite being buggy, is still the most complete.
[1:32:36] <TheGunrunner91> fight me
[1:32:37] <%toolofparanoia> like all of it
[1:32:39] <%krispen_wa> Mask of the Betrayer maybe
[1:32:47] <Ipsenscastle> @AncelDeLambert oh yeah I know, I'm just saying their management kept agreeing to that shit over and over
[1:32:48] <Too_Much_Nukie> I disagree with that. Pillars 1 and 2 are much easier to recommend as complete games than New Vegas.
[1:32:49] <Ids560> Tyranny is pretty good
[1:32:52] <%krispen_wa> But NWN2 Vanilla does suck
[1:33:19] <NitronStreams> I fucking love this
[1:33:21] <Valentinius_Anodyne> Yeah, I think the Pillars games are pretty good, and Tyranny is neat too
[1:33:26] <%cylish> NW2 has the worst friggen interface
[1:33:32] <%GarbageQueenEllie> They should've played "Mama Said Knock You Out" over this
[1:33:34] <%cylish> its like they wanted to hurt you for playing the game
[1:33:35] <%sweetestbeefs> man i love the shield texture bug where you're just black
[1:33:39] <+shadic7700> HK shit talking HK is great
[1:33:50] <+Kriptin> I feel like in another game this'd be several minutes of DOOM.
[1:33:54] <+welly_____> ja
[1:33:54] <saraizarai> This is cut content... for a reason
[1:34:03] <Too_Much_Nukie> For the love of God use a shield.
[1:34:15] <GustauveVIII> is pat prepared for one huge slog throughout this facility? wandering it isn't a problem; killing the enemies with slowass attacks is
[1:34:15] <%krispen_wa> all they had to do was make every enemy NOT a damage sponge
[1:34:20] <%Daxalog> Dont you have power blast and crit shots?
[1:34:23] <+NopeBadguy> @patstaresat you can use a medkit as a free action every round by activating one in the pause menu without using an action
[1:34:27] <%sweetestbeefs> Honestly, this whole section is meh. combat is slow as shit and there's just so much of it in this section.
[1:34:36] <%toolofparanoia> don't you have like droid disruptors or something
[1:34:58] <%sweetestbeefs> yeah, you have to prepare for this section.
[1:35:02] <%sweetestbeefs> sucks ass
[1:35:07] <GustauveVIII> @PatStaresAt recommend setting the difficulty to easy; combat isnt really that interesting
[1:35:16] <%krispen_wa> just turn it to easy for this one section Pat
[1:35:27] <%sweetestbeefs> nobody will snitch
[1:35:30] <%sweetestbeefs> we promise
[1:35:44] <%krispen_wa> EHHHHH? EASY MODO
[1:35:46] <%JumboCrunchies> I'm gonna snitch so hard
[1:35:54] <+projectmanatees> someone will make the easy mode is now selectable kple
[1:35:56] <+projectmanatees> *joke
[1:36:05] <+shadic7700> Easy mode was always selectable
[1:36:09] <+NopeBadguy> EASY MODE HAS BEEN SELECTED
[1:36:09] <%toolofparanoia> Gotta cheat hard
[1:36:09] <+KaitoJinn> ^ you kinda just did
[1:36:10] <%GarbageQueenEllie> This section is too dull for my tastes, too quiet. This part ought to be LOUD
[1:36:14] <+shadic7700> There u happy
[1:36:15] <%dekkitout> No, he's just MORE armed
[1:36:34] <Gruhunchously> Riveting gameplay
[1:36:35] <%sweetestbeefs> RESTORED CONTENT YEAHHHH
[1:36:38] <$Dakuu75> at least it's not depressing as shit
[1:36:40] <%krispen_wa> They're good at restoring content...not balancing it.
[1:36:41] <%sweetestbeefs> WOO I LOVE IT
[1:36:41] <+welly_____> i have wiped my ass with my excitments
[1:36:44] <%dekkitout> Riveting swashbuckling intensifies
[1:36:50] <%toolofparanoia> I'm watching paint dry and that's more exciting
[1:36:52] <%GarbageQueenEllie> Honestly could've been a rail shooter minigame
[1:36:52] <+shadic7700> Fully armed what is that?!?!
[1:36:56] <%psidefx> The best gunplay
[1:37:01] <OldManDeckardCain> why did you enable this mod LUL
[1:37:04] <%Daxalog> Dont you have a a move with garuntted hits?
[1:37:07] <Valentinius_Anodyne> Alas, this part was cut for good reason
[1:37:09] <OldManDeckardCain> isn't it separate
[1:37:10] <%sweetestbeefs> at least it isnt the robot planet, fuck that restored content
[1:37:13] <%MugenSandan> BIG EXCITE
[1:37:14] <Gruhunchously> oh wow this could get bad
[1:37:24] <TrollKing96> @PatStaresAt This is why I wasnt into the KOTOR games when they came out
[1:37:26] <%sweetestbeefs> the gun is very boring in this game
[1:37:30] <DXLelouch24> her HKs MUCH weaker than Woolies
[1:37:30] <GustauveVIII> HK factory gaiz! the best cut content! we needed to see it!
[1:37:30] <%krispen_wa> Dex Duel Guns is actually super strong
[1:37:34] <DXLelouch24> your*
[1:37:36] <Mikers29> gun characters feel fine if youre not playing them
[1:37:45] <KaiserMario> Jedi powers are too busted for guns to be any good...
[1:37:50] <%GarbageQueenEllie> Combat would be the biggest upgrade w/ regards to a remake
[1:37:57] <ABakedDemon> It's a reminder that some cut content was cut for a reason not just time
[1:38:19] <%sweetestbeefs> this whole section could just be a cutscene or a hallway with multiple conversations, not a whole fucking combat section
[1:38:21] <%krispen_wa> and think that the Droid Planet mod is a WHOLE PLANET of this
[1:38:23] <+shadic7700> He’s a good boi droid
[1:38:27] <%toolofparanoia> I mean your character is a jedi why would you even use guns at all
[1:38:28] <Gruhunchously> This section would be fine if hey balanced it better
[1:38:33] <GustauveVIII> @PatStaresAt guns can act as ranged lightsabers in this game; they powered them up pretty well. The only problem with guns is that droids don't scale as well as MAINCHAR.
[1:38:48] <%cylish> THROW WIDE THE GATES TO HELL!
[1:39:04] <DXLelouch24> @PatStaresAt your HK is emuch weaker than Woolies was cause you Darks
[1:39:04] <Too_Much_Nukie> I could see a complete version of this being the best part of the game, HK is great and there's a lot of good banter here.
[1:39:06] <%sweetestbeefs> they should have had bao dur with HK like they originally planned it
[1:39:09] <DXLelouch24> sides
[1:39:13] <+shadic7700> Do IT
[1:40:04] <DXLelouch24> Woolies HK had mega death gear so this was easy
[1:40:14] <Gruhunchously> @PatStaresAt Talk to them though
[1:40:14] <%toolofparanoia> Those clankers got scrapped!
[1:40:16] <%krispen_wa> I wonder if theres a mod that rebalances this mod
[1:40:25] <TrollKing96> Do droid models have set personalities?
[1:40:34] <%krispen_wa> THEY TALK
[1:40:38] <%sweetestbeefs> you can talk to them
[1:40:40] <+megaman_sentinel> middle 1
[1:40:41] <Gruhunchously> @PatStaresAt Talk to the middle one
[1:40:45] <%krispen_wa> middle one
[1:40:50] <%sweetestbeefs> walk up to the middle one
[1:40:54] <%toolofparanoia> Talk to your brothers
[1:41:29] <%sweetestbeefs> is Paige in the mirror world too?
[1:41:53] <+AdumPlaze> 76 raiders from AdumPlaze have joined! 
[1:42:04] <%sweetestbeefs> oh shit RAID
[1:42:12] <benjiFG> oo new camera angle
[1:42:12] <imaginaryfanboy> adumFace RAID adumFace RAID adumFace RAID adumFace RAID adumFace RAID adumFace RAID adumFace RAID adumFace RAID adumFace RAID
[1:42:14] <+jrockmaster392> hello
[1:42:22] <%toolofparanoia> BIG RAID
[1:43:10] <%JumboCrunchies> Wooooooo
[1:43:28] <%krispen_wa> RAID REDEMPTION
[1:43:30] <Gruhunchously> HKs talking shit to each other
[1:43:45] <$Dakuu75> man, this ONE voice actor must've made bank in this scene
[1:43:59] <%sweetestbeefs> Multiple personality disorder be like:
[1:44:14] <%Daxalog> Its the Yuri Lowenthol bunker from fallout
[1:44:21] <%GarbageQueenEllie> Oh hey Raid Pals
[1:44:24] <Gruhunchously> Hewy remember that one sidequest on Taris about the 'promised land' of droid servants.
[1:44:44] <%sweetestbeefs> HAUGHTY
[1:44:46] <+Whiskey_T_Foxtrot> These guys sounds a lot more reasonable than the sith or jedi tbh
[1:45:14] <%AncelDeLambert> how many of you does he have to kill to prove he isn't obsolete?
[1:45:17] <Gruhunchously> Did they accuse HK-47 of having bad hygene?
[1:45:41] <%GarbageQueenEllie> These shitkid droids need to respect they elders
[1:45:53] <%sweetestbeefs> @AncelDeLambert he can't kill them, his self-preservation code wont let him
[1:46:16] <%Daxalog> dude..
[1:46:24] <$Dakuu75> omfg, lmao
[1:46:25] <+Gamblor69> Lol
[1:46:31] <Gruhunchously> LUL
[1:46:38] <OperatorJo_> LUL
[1:46:39] <%sweetestbeefs> left HK is a great, i love him
[1:47:03] <$Dakuu75> "aggresive mocking": "YOU FUCKING IDIOT!"
[1:47:37] <+shadic7700> The 1st eh #47
[1:47:55] <%sweetestbeefs> quite competent? he literally enslaved a good part of the universe
[1:48:15] <$SGrim> "If HK-47 was the first, why isn't he called HK-1? Curious." Turning Point Old Republic
[1:48:16] <Gruhunchously> Yeah, quite competent
[1:48:23] <+shadic7700> Revan is a bit more than competent
[1:48:49] <@SSaryn> What a bunch of loveable shitheads
[1:49:37] <CarlTheBlind> Pat i dare you to yeehaw right now
[1:49:55] <+welly_____> Whose th new guy?
[1:50:00] <masterofzin> !uptime
[1:50:00] <@Moobot> I've been playing this game for how long? Oh only 1h 50m.
[1:50:29] <CarlTheBlind> close enough
[1:50:34] <arussoltzm> New guy is Goto isn’t it?
[1:50:34] <Too_Much_Nukie> @PatStaresAt Palpatine's behind it all.
[1:50:40] <Gruhunchously> KOTOR 2, where the dialogue is fun and the combat is boring.
[1:50:44] <Too_Much_Nukie> No
[1:50:50] <SaltyAzteca> @SSaryn Smug statement: Your sarcastic retorts only serve to make us stronger. MrDestructoid
[1:50:54] <+welly_____> new guys is hk-47?
[1:50:56] <+KaitoJinn> grenade spam
[1:50:59] <Gruhunchously> Just throw a grenade
[1:51:17] <%sweetestbeefs> what a FUN and EXCITING section
[1:51:27] <SaltyAzteca> Also Pat is lying back, oh no
[1:51:38] <Too_Much_Nukie> It's the worst.
[1:51:38] <%sweetestbeefs> SMOKIN SEXY STYLE YEAH
[1:51:43] <Too_Much_Nukie> This is worse than the droid planet.
[1:51:51] <%dork_doggler> why is patcam mirrored
[1:51:51] <%GarbageQueenEllie> Remember when Kreia was telling us how disappointed she was? That was fun.
[1:51:57] <Mikers29> Exciting Jedi Action!
[1:51:58] <+welly_____> ea this needed some love.
[1:52:08] <cyclog> fellas this is the right side of the couch ?
[1:52:08] <Goodvibes99508> might be the reason this was cut
[1:52:10] <+welly_____> @PatStaresAt  how would you change this section tho?
[1:52:11] <%sweetestbeefs> I WANNA GO BACK TO KRIEA
[1:52:14] <cyclog> or is it a camera switch ?
[1:52:22] <@SSaryn> I don't think you blame KOTOR for that entirely but there are definitely one or two sections of these kinds of areas in KOTOR 1 and 2.
[1:52:22] <cyclog> I am having trouble with this change.
[1:52:24] <%MugenSandan> BIG EXCITE
[1:52:25] <%Alazull> Turns out D and D third edition style combat can be really boring
[1:52:34] <%sweetestbeefs> make it a cutscene
[1:52:39] <%GarbageQueenEllie> Just make all the fights super easy
[1:52:45] <Ids560> making these fights go quicker would probably help
[1:52:46] <Gruhunchously> Get rid of all these stupid droids that serve no purpose other than combat encounters
[1:52:47] <%sweetestbeefs> or a hallway with one or two battles
[1:52:48] <+Ruddagger> I'll be honest, KOTOR 1>2 despite all the internet hype.
[1:52:54] <+welly_____> Does hk-47 enable a fleet of driods here?
[1:53:05] <%itsjusttom25> hey pat have u finished persona 5 strikers yet ?
[1:53:05] <%sweetestbeefs> or even give hk another companion so it's not just him
[1:53:14] <$Dakuu75> they could give you a bunch of droids to ad to your party, temporarily. like HK hacked them
[1:53:26] <+KaitoJinn> this section could have been something cooler like HK actually having to assasinate someone.
[1:53:26] <Ipsenscastle> yeah this LP has disabused me of the notion that 2 is better
[1:53:27] <Gruhunchously> @Too_Much_Nukie This has one thing over the Droid Planet in that it's mercifully short
[1:53:29] <+shadic7700> ^
[1:53:35] <pokefan9956> pat you forgot to tweet
[1:53:36] <+KaitoJinn> rather than this
[1:53:39] <@SSaryn> Not a bad idea actually now that I think about it
[1:53:45] <%Mr_Pylon> the wierdest thing about this to me if your HK not being voiced
[1:54:03] <@SSaryn> Would at least provide a challenge and still give a 3 person party.
[1:54:10] <Too_Much_Nukie> To be fair to the devs, this likely isn't how they intended this area to go at all.
[1:54:12] <+SilverDevilfish> I installed the droid planet mod and it actually made me put the game down
[1:54:26] <%sweetestbeefs> It is.
[1:54:29] <+megaman_sentinel> just put it on easy 4 this
[1:54:30] <sweetestbeefs> dont ever play it
[1:54:41] <@SSaryn> Wow that sure is a step down.
[1:54:41] <Too_Much_Nukie> The restored content is the cutscenes and the map area. Part of the reason it was cut is because they didn't even have any combat encounters yet.
[1:54:45] <%GarbageQueenEllie> I played through the whole thing, piece of shit broke my game. Fuck that mod
[1:54:57] <rosemon5001> i mean a one off checking it out would be interesting tbh
[1:54:57] <Nix_Abyss> yeah the mod is worse from what I saw but this is also kinda meh
[1:55:09] <Nix_Abyss> makes sense why they cut it
[1:55:13] <%MugenSandan> okay but is the mod so bad it adds fetishes
[1:55:19] <%barrakuta371> yes
[1:55:20] <%TECHNO_OUTLAW> TECHNO_OUTLAW subscribed at Tier 1. They've subscribed for 49 months! 
[1:55:20] <Aydarkzero> looks like it LUL
[1:55:22] <Valentinius_Anodyne> For sure
[1:55:22] <@SSaryn> Going through this section, yes
[1:55:24] <%Alazull> Yeah
[1:55:24] <SaltyAzteca> Yes it makes sense
[1:55:25] <%dekkitout> Yeah
[1:55:25] <%sweetestbeefs> yeah, i feel you
[1:55:30] <Too_Much_Nukie> You could probably finish it this stream.
[1:55:30] <Nix_Abyss> nope KOTOR 2 has that effect LUL
[1:55:31] <SaltyAzteca> Wraaaaaap it up
[1:55:33] <Gruhunchously> Yeah...
[1:55:33] <mayormanders> how much longer is there
[1:55:36] <+NopeBadguy> you're burning out
[1:55:37] <Too_Much_Nukie> Depending on how long this section takes.
[1:55:39] <%Mr_Pylon> good ol sunk cost boredom
[1:55:39] <Cal_ixo> There's a reason they cut this content
[1:55:44] <+projectmanatees> i feel like disco eyliusm spolied the fact you dont need combat just dialouge
[1:55:46] <Goodvibes99508> grenades
[1:55:47] <+megaman_sentinel> this part suks
[1:55:48] <%sweetestbeefs> the ending of this game is really...padded.
[1:55:49] <OperatorJo_> that's the kotor experience
[1:56:03] <@commanderclaw> Obsidian has never made a good combat system: Change my mind
[1:56:05] <Gruhunchously> It's the Deep Roads problem
[1:56:06] <%sweetestbeefs> it picks up after this section tho!
[1:56:07] <@SSaryn> So thinking about it now, KOTOR 1 or KOTOR 2? In terms of replays?
[1:56:29] <%sweetestbeefs> 1 was at least a finished game tho
[1:56:30] <Nix_Abyss> KOTOR 1 is better
[1:56:32] <%sweetestbeefs> to be fair
[1:56:32] <Meekest> Kashyyk sucks REAL bad
[1:56:34] <Nix_Abyss> but lol fair
[1:56:35] <%Mr_Pylon> 2 is more interesting than 1, but 1 is a better game
[1:56:36] <Gruhunchously> The Star Forge though
[1:56:36] <%GarbageQueenEllie> MANAAN THO
[1:56:44] <+perry_the_pleb> 1
[1:56:50] <+EmptyMug> Grey/lightside for kotor 2 is much better story wise
[1:56:52] <+shadic7700> Revan is cooler than the Exile
[1:56:52] <Ids560> this game seems like it has higher highs than 1
[1:56:55] <+Ruddagger> 1 seems to have way more interesting choices to me, having supporting characters kill each other
[1:57:05] <%sweetestbeefs> the story for 2 will always be my favorite but 1 is a better game
[1:57:14] <GustauveVIII> @PatStaresAt Would you recommend TSLRM or vanilla KOTOR2?
[1:57:22] <Aydarkzero> wow
[1:57:25] <+projectmanatees> i played 1 steam version its broken as hell
[1:57:31] <%Alazull> Alazull subscribed at Tier 1. They've subscribed for 18 months! Yay, as many months as went into the development of this game! Unfortunate that KotoR 2 ends with such a wet fart, hopefully if there is a 3 they focus on keeping the story awesome while making the combat waaaay more interesting.
[1:57:35] <+temporaryplaceholder> It's a good wild ride
[1:57:36] <Nix_Abyss> I really hope the new KOTOR is good and fixes these issues 1 and 2 had lol if it is action combat like it seems its gonna be god I hope it never drags as a game
[1:57:39] <+solphum> This section with HK is part of the restoration patch right? Probably why this sucks so much tbh
[1:57:40] <%Mr_Pylon> this right here is a 4 at best
[1:57:43] <Too_Much_Nukie> Especially when you reach Malachor.
[1:57:49] <Too_Much_Nukie> Vanilla Malachor is dogshit.
[1:57:52] <%cylish> doesnt hk get a bonus for using the sniper shot?
[1:57:58] <+megaman_sentinel> it's a different game
[1:57:59] <+projectmanatees> i will not blame anyone who wants to cheat in 1
[1:58:11] <Valentinius_Anodyne> This is the part of the Restored Content that's bad, but the rest improves the experience immensly
[1:58:13] <%sweetestbeefs> the endgame is completely different
[1:58:16] <Too_Much_Nukie> Because that's what happens.
[1:58:23] <%GarbageQueenEllie> Sounds amazing
[1:58:29] <Too_Much_Nukie> Malachor makes no sense at all in vanilla.
[1:58:44] <waywardhavoc> using the cut content patch?
[1:58:56] <Gruhunchously> It doesn't make that much more sense in Restored Content
[1:59:03] <@SSaryn> Like this is all really cool. All of the cutscene parts.
[1:59:06] <SaltyAzteca> LUL
[1:59:09] <@SSaryn> Not the combat parts.
[1:59:11] <%dekkitout> Statement: "Motherfucker, knock it off!!"
[1:59:34] <%TheCallousKing> TheCallousKing subscribed with Prime. They've subscribed for 23 months! Ayyyyy! Almost 2 years.On a more important note... Many Congrats on your engagement Pat and Paige. I never knew I could be so happy for random Internet people, whose content I've been watching for years.
[1:59:35] <%Alazull> The idea of this section is cool. It's just that it could have been like three rooms, and done.
[1:59:40] <+solphum> Feels bad that you only have HK and every enemy has energy shields to elongate the fights
[1:59:45] <+megaman_sentinel> turn off camera
[2:00:05] <@SSaryn> I was gonna say if this was just a puzzle section with like.. 3-5 rooms would this automatically be better?
[2:00:20] <%GarbageQueenEllie> Just have a cutscene where HK shuts off all the enemy droids and make it a hallway
[2:00:29] <Gruhunchously> I'd agree with that
[2:00:41] <%sweetestbeefs> This would be so much better as a cutscene, yeah.
[2:01:04] <%Alazull> @SSaryn Yes
[2:01:07] <Meekest> They'll change 3's ending (no they won't)
[2:01:17] <SaltyAzteca> ME1 was fun as fuck.
[2:01:19] <OperatorJo_> same
[2:01:30] <%GarbageQueenEllie> 3's ending was bad, but the entirety of Andromeda was a SIN
[2:01:32] <%sweetestbeefs> ME2 is GOAT
[2:01:33] <@SSaryn> You'll be like, wow 66% of ME3 is great, and then...
[2:01:38] <Ids560> Mass Effect 1 is real good
[2:01:40] <%abusywizard> mass effect 3 is super cool if you just don't pay attention to literally anything after the halfway point
[2:01:41] <Bigyanno> unpopular opinion I liked ME1 combat more than ME2's chest high walls and fucking limited ammo
[2:01:50] <@SSaryn> Actually nah more like 75-80%
[2:01:54] <Gruhunchously> @PatStaresAt Find the Communications room
[2:02:06] <+projectmanatees> ME 1's mako was dumb fun
[2:02:19] <lol_red_ranger> find the computer room!
[2:02:27] <%sweetestbeefs> FIND THE COMPUTER ROOM
[2:02:36] <Bigyanno> The Mako was great, the planets were just badly generated
[2:02:38] <GustauveVIII> @PatStaresAt What's Pat's favorite class in ME?
[2:02:38] <+SilverDevilfish> It was replaced with a terrible probe minigame
[2:02:40] <%Alazull> First room could've been a combat, with a window that shows you the production line. Second room could've been the reactor controls. Third room could've been the maintenance area with maybe a couple of subrooms
[2:02:42] <Animal_Farm4> The Mako was awful but it WAS fun to yeet myself off a cliff with the boosters
[2:02:43] <%GarbageQueenEllie> Hammerhead was ok, but no Mako
[2:02:44] <%sweetestbeefs> mako was dumb fun and it was legendary
[2:02:44] <Ipsenscastle> I also liked the Mako
[2:02:49] <%krispen_wa> Mako Tsunami
[2:02:55] <%sweetestbeefs> running into those big ass geth was fun as shit
[2:02:58] <%abusywizard> the mako was a cool concept but it handled so horribly, i really hope they fix it in the remaster
[2:03:00] <%toolofparanoia> Who here played ME3 with the extended ending DLC? Did it make a difference to you?
[2:03:13] <+projectmanatees> Never fear friends soon we will be graced by fully voiced Cuno PridePog then we can play the best RPG
[2:03:15] <ammobasket> Makou LUL
[2:03:19] <%krispen_wa> little difference. still bad.
[2:03:28] <+grandtwinkus> Word, controls for Mako were shite, sure, but first ME had a sense of scale that all other games lacked
[2:03:31] <@SSaryn> Literally none.
[2:03:34] <%sweetestbeefs> the extended ending was like an extra screen and some dialouge
[2:03:40] <%sweetestbeefs> it wasn't good.
[2:03:42] <%krispen_wa> Citadel however? thats fine
[2:03:45] <%GarbageQueenEllie> @projectmanatees The fuck does CUNO care?!?!
[2:03:54] <TrollKing96> What does the voice actor for Iroh and Aku have to do with Mass Effect?
[2:03:55] <@SSaryn> DAY 1 DLC.
[2:03:56] <Gruhunchously> DLC!
[2:04:00] <arussoltzm> At the time dlc made it better but it feels like little was really added when looking back
[2:04:06] <Ipsenscastle> I didnt even think the handling was bad, you just had to be aware that your thrusters would send you directly upwards so to pay attention to your position
[2:04:07] <%sweetestbeefs> yeah but THE GHOST CHILD! THE GHOST CHILD GUYS
[2:04:13] <%sweetestbeefs> WAR IS BAD
[2:04:15] <%krispen_wa> But SAVE EARTH tho
[2:04:24] <Gruhunchously> There's almost no exploration, just one combat sequence afteer another
[2:04:27] <+SilverDevilfish> Time to job to some loser to advance plot on the Asari homeworld
[2:04:31] <%sweetestbeefs> WHY FIGHT WHEN WE COULD BE PEACE
[2:04:32] <+projectmanatees> @GarbageQueenEllie (He does care... maybe)
[2:04:32] <Nix_Abyss> its all militarized and war cuz the reapers lol
[2:04:35] <%krispen_wa> even though earth is the thing we're least connected to in the ME trilogy
[2:04:38] <Ipsenscastle> The best part of Mass Effect was always the Citadel
[2:04:39] <Nix_Abyss> less space and alien
[2:04:41] <%GarbageQueenEllie> @PatStaresAt It's like some Call of Duty asshole was in charge of design
[2:04:43] <%GetMendoza> GetMendoza subscribed with Prime. They've subscribed for 25 months! 
[2:04:46] <%dork_doggler> playt morrowind
[2:04:52] <Goodvibes99508> weren't they going for the Warfrare money with 3?
[2:04:54] <%krispen_wa> Rannoch
[2:05:01] <%toolofparanoia> Yeah... ME3 is just see place we heard about but shit it fucked
[2:05:08] <Gruhunchously> The Citadel DLC was pure fanservice
[2:05:11] <%krispen_wa> Citadel is just Mass Effect 2 part 2
[2:05:12] <%abusywizard> it actually kinda sucks that ME2 was so fucking cool, ME3 is really embarrassing as a follow up
[2:05:12] <%MugenSandan> in all fairness Pat in Final Fantasy XIV the garlean capital is also bombed out
[2:05:12] <%sweetestbeefs> it's just fanservice
[2:05:13] <%cylish> Felt like EA was doing the same thing it did with dead space, MAKE MORE LIKE A SHOOTER THO
[2:05:15] <%Mr_Pylon> while tens of millions die per minute
[2:05:20] <%Alazull> @PatStaresAt Yeah, the idea of ME3 starting at the end times was a bad idea. Act 1 should've been going around trying at least one more time to get everyone on board then the Reapers should've shown up in force.
[2:05:20] <Aydarkzero> that was an actual dlc?
[2:05:28] <@SSaryn> Andromeda's got you there Kappa
[2:05:44] <%GarbageQueenEllie> No, LESS Shooters! Fuck those Medal of Honor fanboys! FUCK EM
[2:05:44] <jorniev> LUL
[2:05:47] <OperatorJo_> that DLC has no reason being that good
[2:05:47] <+grandtwinkus> For all its' junk first ME was the best in terms of story and atmosphere. Being a space cop chasing another space cop was fun. The whole ANCIENT EVIL thing was honestly lame
[2:05:56] <Gruhunchously> ooops
[2:06:01] <$SGrim> Weed?
[2:06:03] <Valentinius_Anodyne> Left HK means well, I love him :)
[2:06:04] <+cafefunk> damn how long is this game
[2:06:08] <%toolofparanoia> Citadel DLC was tight but yeah its a tone shift from, billions are dying to lets play arcade games!
[2:06:10] <+krispen_wa> Mass Effect should have just been a dating sim
[2:06:23] <%sweetestbeefs> @PatStaresAt also the fact that shepherd went around for two games beforehand spouting about the reapers and nobody fucking believed him or took him seriously at all
[2:06:28] <Solarwork> Congrats on the engagement Pat !
[2:06:29] <%krispen_wa> thats why everyone headcanons it as an epilogue
[2:06:50] <NitronStreams> MILLIONS of deaths every second
[2:06:50] <Bigyanno> immoral at best, irrelevant at worst
[2:06:53] <+projectmanatees> best team is garrus and wrex change my mind
[2:06:57] <%GarbageQueenEllie> Remember when playing video games was FUN?
[2:07:02] <Gruhunchously> Also, Cerberus becomes a galactic superpower for some reason.
[2:07:04] <%cylish> If they had tried to present that this was a years long war it wouldnt have been so bad
[2:07:06] <%toolofparanoia> Reapers are like NO FUN ALLOWED, DIE
[2:07:18] <Solarwork> Just heard about it in the castle superbeast podcast, i've been listening to you fools for years and i cant say how happy i am for you!

[2:08:32] <+fromnibelheim> love these dudes
[2:08:32] <Bigyanno> I get why people love HK but I've just never been that attached to him
[2:08:36] <%toolofparanoia> This is the greatest dialogue I have ever heard
[2:08:37] <Too_Much_Nukie> So this is why in canon Bao-Dur is here.
[2:08:46] <Too_Much_Nukie> Bao-Dur is the one who changes HK's programming in canon.
[2:08:54] <+Ruddagger> I just think the joke wore out like 30 hours ago
[2:09:01] <%moonmintparadise> THERE IT ISSSSS
[2:09:04] <%sweetestbeefs> OH MAN I CLAPPED
[2:09:10] <NitronStreams> I dunno I like it
[2:09:11] <Aydarkzero> i understood that reference
[2:09:12] <%toolofparanoia> HE SAID THE THING!
[2:09:14] <%krispen_wa> LUL
[2:09:17] <sweetestbeefs> I RECOGNIZED THE CATCHPHRASE AND I CLAPPED
[2:09:18] <Gruhunchously> Hey, he said it!
[2:09:19] <Valentinius_Anodyne> "Dripping with Condescension: Optimal accuracy ratio achieved."
[2:09:20] <@SSaryn> lol gottem ez
[2:09:32] <GustauveVIII> HUGE SLOG MODE
[2:09:36] <+SilverDevilfish> ...
[2:09:36] <+EmotionalFatGuy> they tanky
[2:09:39] <%sweetestbeefs> welcome to hell
[2:09:40] <%Alazull> This should've ended with a cutscene
[2:09:40] <%krispen_wa> RIVETING
[2:09:43] <Gruhunchously> Oh god this is painful...after such a strong moment too
[2:09:44] <SaltyAzteca> DUAL OF THE FATES INTENSIFIES!
[2:09:45] <%Nekros4442> wtf is this a raid boss?
[2:09:45] <Too_Much_Nukie> Some would say, too much.
[2:09:45] <Aydarkzero> maybe they are superior monkaS
[2:09:45] <NitronStreams> WHY
[2:09:49] <+crazyspartan214> this is gonna that a while
[2:09:50] <Animal_Farm4> Isn't rapid fire also really weak in this?
[2:09:51] <%sweetestbeefs> oh you thought it was bad before???
[2:09:57] <Too_Much_Nukie> Almost like the mod creators didn't get it.
[2:09:57] <+megaman_sentinel> put it on easy
[2:09:57] <%Alazull> Because technically they're programming hasn't been changed
[2:09:58] <%GarbageQueenEllie> Ya know what? This really shoulda been a cutscene
[2:09:59] <%Mr_Pylon> LASER SLAP FIGHT
[2:10:01] <%Nekros4442> At this point just fucking rip off their armor
[2:10:03] <%Alazull> *their
[2:10:08] <Gruhunchously> IT IS ON EASY
[2:10:09] <%sweetestbeefs> rapid fire is pretty shit for this section
[2:10:09] <Too_Much_Nukie> And thought this needed a big boss battle at the end.
[2:10:11] <Goodvibes99508> do you have any Ion grenades?
[2:10:12] <+megaman_sentinel> oh shit
[2:10:22] <Gruhunchously> Oh man...oh man this is bad
[2:10:22] <%toolofparanoia> Dialogue good, combat ABYSMAL
[2:10:30] <Bigyanno> Some things were cut from the game for time reasons, some were cut because they weren't fun. The mod adds both back in
[2:10:34] <%krispen_wa> SO GOOD
[2:10:38] <+megaman_sentinel> yea ion
[2:10:38] <+Ruddagger> grenades?
[2:10:39] <%sweetestbeefs> building crits is the only decent way of playing this section and you need to build for it
[2:10:43] <jorniev> me3 assumes too much that space war is like earth war, instead of the mass encompassing cluster fuck that it would actually be
[2:10:43] <%Mr_Pylon> I probably have time to make a coffee while this is going on
[2:10:44] <GustauveVIII> dual pistols probably would've been better
[2:10:47] <GustauveVIII> hit 3x
[2:10:49] <%ShogunNoonto> and this is why it was cut
[2:10:53] <%GarbageQueenEllie> I guess some things about game design don't become apparent until you actually have to play the thing
[2:10:57] <NitronStreams> why does every attack do like 2% of their health?
[2:10:59] <Valentinius_Anodyne> @toolofparanoia Kotor is a nutshell, for as much as I love it
[2:11:01] <Gruhunchously> Seriously, couldn't they at least have given them less health?
[2:11:02] <TrollKing96> Why was this part included with the Restored Contend Mod?
[2:11:05] <Bigyanno> Can't you just nade them?
[2:11:11] <Aydarkzero> gonna get a drink maybe he'll be done by then LUL
[2:11:13] <+welly_____> @PatStaresAt  Can we find you a better blaster?
[2:11:13] <%Alazull> This should've ended with HK coming back, shooting one and hitting the other two with an ion grenade as they expressed their surprise
[2:11:16] <Goodvibes99508> @patstaresat use your grenades
[2:11:17] <luckerzerker> ion weapon?
[2:11:20] <Too_Much_Nukie> @jorniev I dunno, the reaper war isn't even a war from the reapers perspective. It's more of a large scale invasion.
[2:11:20] <Gruhunchously> I love you but you hurt me so
[2:11:20] <Animal_Farm4> How much does a normal attack do?
[2:11:21] <+SuperNovasz> finally caught a pat stream and he spent two hours fighting two robots
[2:11:21] <%AzureGale> The hottest DPS race
[2:11:31] <Too_Much_Nukie> It makes sense the way it goes down.
[2:11:35] <Ipsenscastle> so Pat, do you recommend the restored content mod?
[2:11:36] <GustauveVIII> try using your special attack gear?
[2:11:39] <@SSaryn> NICE
[2:11:40] <Valentinius_Anodyne> what a great streamer he is

[2:12:19] <Gruhunchously> @PatStaresAt If it's any consolation, these are the ONLY ones with massive amounts of health for some reason. The ones on the next level are more reasonable.

[2:12:53] <+crazyspartan214> the hypiest fight it has ever been
[2:12:53] <%AkronymCLT> Play Tsushima for the first time
[2:12:54] <@SSaryn> It's also kind of a funny noise
[2:12:55] <%sweetestbeefs> look at this GAMEPLAY
[2:12:55] <+EmotionalFatGuy> bzzzzt
[2:13:03] <Too_Much_Nukie> You can't change weapons during combat.
[2:13:12] <%coward_man> the HYPEST gameplay on Twitch
[2:13:13] <%AkronymCLT> *Playing
[2:13:17] <+megaman_sentinel> no ion damage tho
[2:13:23] <Too_Much_Nukie> This game already had too much droid fighting.
[2:13:27] <%sweetestbeefs> I LOVE star wars
[2:13:32] <Gruhunchously> I'm cringing so hard my insides have turned inside out
[2:13:42] <%RedSqurrl> There's some restored content that's great. But things like M4-78 and HK Factory should've been kept cut in the mod. It just ruins so much of the momentum.
[2:13:44] <@SSaryn> Is it fucked up that Loop Hero has more interesting combat than this
[2:13:48] <%GarbageQueenEllie> Plz tell me tabletop RPG's aren't actually like this
[2:13:52] <+crazyspartan214> Bao Dur died for this
[2:13:58] <Meekest> Loop Hero is really fun
[2:14:06] <Aydarkzero> YEAH
[2:14:08] <Ipsenscastle> @SSaryn thats genuinely funny
[2:14:09] <Gruhunchously> YOU DID IT
[2:14:13] <%sweetestbeefs> BAO DUR DIED FOR THIS OH MY GOD
[2:14:20] <Valentinius_Anodyne> Loop Hero is genuinely great
[2:14:25] <Too_Much_Nukie> @RedSqurrl I maintain that HK Factory should've been restored but they shouldn't have beefed up the enemy encounters like they did. Have a small amount of weak enemies instead of this shit.
[2:14:25] <$RealThiele> THIS IS WHY RANGED CLASSES IN d&d 3RD EDITION WERE AWFUL, NO DAMAGE AT ALL
[2:14:28] <%moonmintparadise> man i fucking miss force lightning at times like these
[2:14:34] <Too_Much_Nukie> That's on the mod creators not the dev team.
[2:14:37] <%toolofparanoia> Statement: The is no meme. Request: DIE.
[2:14:49] <%JumboCrunchies> @GarbageQueenEllie Sometimes the combat is very back and forth like this, but you are also sitting across a table from your buddies, yucking it up at the same time.
[2:15:05] <%krispen_wa> Every point you put into sniper shot is now useless
[2:15:06] <+megaman_sentinel> use sniper shot
[2:15:13] <%GarbageQueenEllie> @JumboCrunchies That's good to hear.
[2:15:34] <%sweetestbeefs> it's not great.
[2:15:35] <Gruhunchously> Cut content
[2:15:49] <Too_Much_Nukie> Honestly I would use cheat engine at this point.
[2:15:50] <+welly_____> wtf is tht sound?
[2:15:54] <Bigyanno> Welp, time to get comfy I guess
[2:15:58] <Gruhunchously> CAN'T WAKE UP

[2:16:31] <%abusywizard> they heal now
[2:16:33] <%krispen_wa> seriously this mod is like on version 1.36 or something and NO ONE ever realized that this section sucks?
[2:16:39] <%sweetestbeefs> FUN, ISNT IT???
[2:16:41] <KaiserMario> @PatStaresAt If it was up to you, which ME combat would you choose to put on a remake of the KOTORs?
[2:16:45] <Johndagger17> they heal now
[2:16:48] <+welly_____> i thougt it was pat farting
[2:16:49] <@SSaryn> SUCH DEVASTATION
[2:17:04] <%toolofparanoia> @welly_____ Pat's fat as fuck dog. He loud snorer
[2:17:07] <ExpressNode> Just got back from the used game store and got the mass effect trilogy for PS3 for $20
[2:17:09] <Bigyanno> People know this section sucks but they refuse to admit it because HK DA BES
[2:17:14] <%MugenSandan> HOW VERY GLIB
[2:17:18] <%krispen_wa> I would go through 10 Prae's before doing HK once again
[2:17:20] <%sweetestbeefs> @PatStaresAt imagine this on the hardest difficulty. pain.
[2:17:26] <Gruhunchously> That's what I think
[2:17:32] <%RedSqurrl> yuh agreed
[2:17:40] <Bigyanno> There are a bunch of things in the restored content mod that should not have been restored
[2:17:43] <NitronStreams> yeah is they any reason they could have messed with the health values?
[2:17:49] <+crazyspartan214> The best it has ever been
[2:17:57] <%MelBrooksKA> Pat, it's "restored" content, not "fucked" content spyCappa

[2:18:27] <%Mr_Pylon> say the line HK
[2:18:28] <%sweetestbeefs> try to run for cover and heal?
[2:18:30] <+projectmanatees> are you using hk for the final party?
[2:18:39] <arussoltzm> I believe you can just run past them if you need to
[2:18:42] <%krispen_wa> did he even get all the fancy upgrades for rifles? i dont remember them being THIS tanky?

[2:19:27] <penitentpendant> V had Woolie make a whole extra 'gamesworth' of healing JUST for this section
[2:19:32] <ExpressNode> But it's optimal tho
[2:19:34] <Too_Much_Nukie> Treat Injury has nothing to do with the amount droids heal though.
[2:19:36] <Bigyanno> repair kits go off the repair skill iirc
[2:19:39] <+EmotionalFatGuy> need an optimal accuracy emote now

[2:20:00] <%krispen_wa> yeah, even when V prepped him super hard for this, it STILL took forever
[2:20:04] <%sweetestbeefs> but how about that optimization though?
[2:20:04] <+megaman_sentinel> put ion on gun
[2:20:07] <%GarbageQueenEllie> Upgrade the FUCK out of your gun
[2:20:08] <Gruhunchously> @PatStaresAt If you can get any ion capabilites for you gun, I'd recommend it

[2:20:22] <kenny_biff> is this the droid planet? is it all indoors? Kappa
[2:20:25] <%dork_doggler> omg is he still in this section
[2:20:33] <Bigyanno> maybe it's because this gun is doing 1-10 when lightsabers and main party guns do like 40 per hit
[2:20:36] <%toolofparanoia> make gun kill robot better

[2:23:15] <penitentpendant> I've got to the point in P5S where I just buy everything in the store when I get out of a dungeon because of how much bonus bosses drain you of resources

[2:23:37] <Gruhunchously> Break some stuff down then
[2:23:50] <%krispen_wa> just scrap all your shit weapons
[2:23:54] <Gruhunchously> FIGHT THOSE MIND GOBLINS
[2:24:02] <%krispen_wa> YOURE IN ENDGAME, YOU DONT NEED ANYTHING
[2:24:04] <%sweetestbeefs> scrap the shitter stuff
[2:24:09] <+megaman_sentinel> u have so much crap u don't use
[2:24:09] <Gruhunchously> Start scrapping the extraneous lightsabers
[2:24:10] <%krispen_wa> Destrot them all
[2:24:11] <penitentpendant> You "Need the parts" now, so break down the bad weapons. Use necessity to fight the goblins!
[2:24:17] <%GarbageQueenEllie> Ayyy there ya go
[2:24:21] <+maenos2> but what if he does need it tho
[2:24:22] <%justcallmebobplease> @penitentpendant I both hate and love that they kept that mechanism in Persona 5 Strikers/Scramble - no, just let me throw money at the shop and buy a whole case of the good stuff dammit!
[2:24:24] <+shadic7700> SHUT UP AND DO IT beat those goblins
[2:24:32] <%rumtumtugnutz> if you had a lightsaber with an integrated holdout blaster, would that be a Jedi gunblade?
[2:24:35] <NitronStreams> ...
[2:24:36] <%Movemeister> Man Gief is coming in strong all of a sudden psaDogchamp sweet baby
[2:24:37] <GustauveVIII> @PatStaresAt spoilers: the only REQUIRED party members for the entire last part of the game are Visas and Mandalore (and maybe Atton)
[2:24:37] <+megaman_sentinel> yep
[2:25:23] <penitentpendant> @justcallmebobplease I got into the early habit of always buying revive items even when I didn't need them so I'd have a stack for any boss
[2:25:27] <+megaman_sentinel> mado chamber
[2:25:30] <%sweetestbeefs> oh man, nobody told me there'd be MATH!
[2:25:37] <Gruhunchously> You can make your gun super busted, and you'll need to for this section
[2:25:42] <+maenos2> mando chamber >.>
[2:25:53] <%GarbageQueenEllie> Yeah scope requires awareness, maybe you could use a droid accessory to cheese it up?

[2:26:36] <%justcallmebobplease> @penitentpendant On harder difficulties - especially NG+ extra difficulty - being able to chain-stunlock strong foes with spamcast weaknesses gets increasingly important... meaning you blow through SP like mad.

[2:26:58] <%ChrisPlaysThing> So, anyone been enjoying Assassin's Creed Valhalla? Thing is massive
[2:27:01] <Wanhangidyilinya> biteyLurk
[2:27:16] <ChrisPlaysThing> oof
[2:27:24] <%dork_doggler> did you stream it?
[2:27:27] <KaiserMario> You spend so much time with OP Jedi powers that you neglected your guns completely, can't blame you tho...
[2:27:29] <Gruhunchously> A ringing endorsement
[2:27:29] <%sweetestbeefs> I hear the non-animus sections are really bad in valhalla
[2:27:30] <Nix_Abyss> its long but I loved the story in it and Origins
[2:27:33] <Too_Much_Nukie> Korone-Chan liked it but not as much as Syndicate.
[2:27:38] <%GarbageQueenEllie> They need to stop cheating w/ the "assassin" label
[2:27:50] <Nix_Abyss> But I totally don't blame people who have issues with it
[2:27:56] <+Ruddagger> new assassins creeds are just overwhelming large, exhausts me a few hours in.

[2:28:16] <ExpressNode> That happened to me with earlier assassin's Creeds and I just stopped. I think around the launch of Unity
[2:28:19] <+HebbieJebbies> It's bullshit MMO quest-y
[2:28:20] <%sweetestbeefs> Just make games about being a viking or whatever, ubisoft. nobody cares about the assassin vs tempar stuff anymore
[2:28:36] <+megaman_sentinel> ion ftw
[2:28:39] <%dork_doggler> wait, assassins creed still bohters with fucking non-animus sections? i wish they'd drop that framing device
[2:28:40] <Ipsenscastle> I liked the Ezio ones and then I was done forever
[2:28:49] <%krispen_wa> Crystal Soul Spear?
[2:28:56] <%ChrisPlaysThing> @sweetestbeefs Things must remain consistent across the Ubiverse
[2:28:57] <Gruhunchously> There's a piece of armor in here that gives you like 75% energy resistance
[2:29:05] <Basch71> they never dropped that aspect LUL
[2:29:22] <Too_Much_Nukie> Isn't that one a random drop?
[2:29:30] <Ipsenscastle> I hear the optimal accuracy ratio was achieved

[2:30:35] <%EternalJedi> masochist robot
[2:30:37] <+maenos2> he is...worryingly into it

[2:32:31] <Too_Much_Nukie> @PatStaresAt It's for the exile. They thought that you would assault the compound.
[2:32:47] <+EmotionalFatGuy> its deadly neurotoxin made by Aperature

[2:37:52] <+SilverDevilfish> Now buy a box of space marines for cost of a discount game title
[2:37:55] <@SSaryn> Or know TTS inside out so it goes as fast as in person
[2:37:56] <Gorgs7> @PatStaresAt yeah, exactly, because nerds still buy plastic and pewter for like 400 dollars, and have to paint it or pay to have it painted
[2:38:01] <$JohnAtDawn> lul
[2:38:01] <+MrYampot> Play Bloodbowl its cool

[2:44:27] <Valentinius_Anodyne> No, I think I'd rather do Deep Roads
[2:44:33] <+mcburgers3000> please tell me this is the last room...
[2:44:37] <$thomassolorio> o my god imagian what the subtitles look like
[2:44:43] <%sweetestbeefs> Imagine this on hard! pain!
[2:44:44] <Too_Much_Nukie> To once again be clear, this fight isn't restored content. All the enemy placement and stats was created by the modders.
[2:44:48] <$thomassolorio> was that elmo
[2:44:53] <Too_Much_Nukie> The devs never intended for this kind of clusterfuck fight.
[2:44:53] <kenny_biff> I still like dragon agwe 1 though
[2:44:54] <TrollKing96> Whoever thought this style of combat was a good idea?
[2:44:54] <%krispen_wa> The Deep Roads are fine if you do them last and are OP enough to get through it on autopilot
[2:44:57] <%GarbageQueenEllie> cuz it ooold
[2:45:01] <Ipsenscastle> DA:O felt aged at the fucking time
[2:45:02] <%krispen_wa> The Fade sucks at all times
[2:45:04] <$thomassolorio> o god
[2:45:08] <%luftraumm1> you know you're just lazy
[2:45:12] <Gruhunchously> AIt
[2:45:14] <LyriumSmuggler> Origins is still great c'mon
[2:45:18] <Zebroneath> Played DA1 on PS3 a few years ago.  It was ROUGH.
[2:45:20] <+maenos2> optimal
[2:45:21] <%DashXero> Dragon Age as a whole aged like shit, honestly.
[2:45:22] <%luftraumm1> the fade as a concept is greater
[2:45:27] <$thomassolorio> is paige ok
[2:45:29] <%sweetestbeefs> this combat is fine, it's just not balanced well at all.
[2:45:32] <+luftraumm1> origins aged badly
[2:45:37] <%krispen_wa> I have never enjoyed Bioware D&D style combat
[2:45:42] <Gorgs7> need multiple party members, or it gets draggy, also just wailing on each other with the same abilities is stupid
[2:46:01] <KaiserMario> Behold the Bioware magic everyone!
[2:46:01] <%krispen_wa> Oh they look horrible
[2:46:08] <%Movemeister> A Star Wars game with FF7R combat would be pretty sweet
[2:46:12] <+Sir_Dolphinian> they're gonna respect this ratio
[2:46:15] <%krispen_wa> Arcane Warrior is just constantly a glowing mess
[2:46:24] <NitronStreams> Biothesda
[2:46:25] <%DashXero> TRUTH
[2:46:28] <%GarbageQueenEllie> It was pretty bad
[2:46:28] <Gruhunchously> The Fade is literally Xen
[2:46:37] <+megaman_sentinel> go right first
[2:46:40] <+maenos2> Oh god it is
[2:46:52] <Ipsenscastle> I don't even remember the fade apart from in 3
[2:46:54] <%krispen_wa> Theres a reason "Skip the Fade" is like top 5 mod downloads
[2:46:55] <Too_Much_Nukie> LUL
[2:46:56] <Valentinius_Anodyne> DA:O didn't age the best, but I really liked setting up AI patterns. Probably for the same reason I liked Gambits in FF12, now that I think about it
[2:47:01] <%sweetestbeefs> PRANKED
[2:47:02] <$thomassolorio> the coolest thing about dragon age is those hulk dogs
[2:47:03] <Ipsenscastle> was it the reused assets world?
[2:47:03] <+maenos2> EMLO
[2:47:07] <Meekest> He scream
[2:47:07] <%AzureGale> MEOW
[2:47:10] <%Terrah48> psaGib psaGib psaGib
[2:47:10] <LyriumSmuggler> Deep Roads is just too damn long, but yeah the fade is just not good
[2:47:12] <%sweetestbeefs> that cat is in PAIN

[2:47:29] <%GarbageQueenEllie> DAO is worth it to watch Morrigan throw shade at every living thing
[2:47:36] <Gruhunchously> @PatStaresAt Check out the HK 51 room
[2:47:46] <Gorgs7> remains over there pat
[2:47:47] <%sweetestbeefs> Morrigan is the best part of dragon age
[2:47:56] <%krispen_wa> Like, even Peragus had tone setting and introduction. the Fade is literally just all dungeon crawl
[2:47:57] <Ipsenscastle> this was miserable
[2:47:59] <Gorgs7> there was dead lootable robot body
[2:48:16] <%sweetestbeefs> whenever morrigan isn't on the screen, people should be asking, "where's morrigan?"
[2:48:46] <Gruhunchously> She's behind you
[2:48:57] <%GarbageQueenEllie> Well, that was dissapointing
[2:49:35] <%krispen_wa> Yeyeyeye we going for the best ending
[2:49:39] <+megaman_sentinel> gg
[2:49:45] <Gruhunchously> Don'
[2:49:52] <Gruhunchously> t be a coward like Woolie was
[2:49:53] <%sweetestbeefs> almost done thank god
[2:50:04] <%krispen_wa> OPTIMAL
[2:50:04] <NitronStreams> HK-47 be like : Meeeeeeee
[2:50:06] <%krispen_wa> ACCURACY
[2:50:10] <%krispen_wa> RATIO
[2:50:11] <%XeroSigmaPrime> Did Woolie miss that? I dont remember the 51s from Woolies
[2:50:12] <%krispen_wa> ACHIEVED
[2:50:21] <+krispen_wa> he totally missed it
[2:50:25] <%krispen_wa> and the final speech
[2:50:33] <%sweetestbeefs> woolie went left first, I belive
[2:50:42] <+IxDomxI> v guided him away from the speech iirc
[2:50:49] <+Skelegroove> That was V's fault
[2:50:55] <%sweetestbeefs> everybody was super salty at V LUL
[2:50:56] <Too_Much_Nukie> Yeah it was V's fault.
[2:51:08] <LVL1_Scumbag> All these optimal ratios
[2:51:09] <Gruhunchously> You're right, it was V's fault
[2:51:16] <Too_Much_Nukie> V got a lot of stuff wrong, especially toward the end.
[2:51:21] <%krispen_wa> And that was the day we all became JUAN GAI
[2:51:25] <Gruhunchously> We tried to tell him but he wouldn't listen.
[2:51:26] <%XeroSigmaPrime> Jeez chat, stop the salt. Mistakes happen
[2:51:29] <+maenos2> Lol good job v
[2:51:37] <Gruhunchously> Obi-Wan Gui
[2:51:44] <Too_Much_Nukie> V never listens to chat when they tell him he's wrong.
[2:52:14] <Gruhunchously> LUL
[2:52:18] <NitronStreams> Uh Oh
[2:52:20] <LyriumSmuggler> uh oh

[2:52:33] <+dante_must_die_exe> oh no
[2:52:34] <%sweetestbeefs> @Too_Much_Nukie to be fair, he said he was more of a fan of the first game than the second, I don't exactly blame him for getting a lot of stuff wrong about the shitshow of an endgame this game has
[2:52:36] <%krispen_wa> LUL

[2:52:47] <%vivaldiva> psaPorgmo
[2:52:51] <Ipsenscastle> done fucked it
[2:52:56] <%GarbageQueenEllie> Ah shit ABORT
[2:52:58] <Meekest> That's definitely a reload
[2:53:00] <NitronStreams> Oops
[2:53:03] <%krispen_wa> i thought it was reversible
[2:53:05] <+megaman_sentinel> go back in
[2:53:07] <%PhysicsLB> PhysicsLB subscribed at Tier 1. They've subscribed for 13 months! 
[2:53:08] <%sweetestbeefs> good job!
[2:53:08] <%MidnightBurst12> whoops
[2:53:09] <+maenos2> guess we can't shit on Woolie alone anymore
[2:53:11] <%sweetestbeefs> you did it!
[2:53:11] <Gruhunchously> Can't you un-upload it?
[2:53:16] <%bread_assassin> It's not that V just made a mistake, but he was adamant about it being the best choice when literally everyone in chat was telling him the opposite.
[2:53:20] <%AncelDeLambert> glass him
[2:53:21] <Meekest> Time to do that fun fight again
[2:53:21] <NitronStreams> it was phrased the same way as the upgrade
[2:53:22] <Too_Much_Nukie> It is reversible.
[2:53:24] <penitentpendant> @krispen_wa It is, it's just flavor
[2:53:24] <%toolofparanoia> Putting Murder in your mind
[2:53:31] <+shadic7700> Glass him
[2:53:32] <%sweetestbeefs> you can reverse it, yeah
[2:53:54] <%krispen_wa> Force anything would make this way less of a slog
[2:53:54] <%JumboCrunchies> Aw man, I wish HK had force speed too. That'd be rad.
[2:53:55] <penitentpendant> Make a robot only skill like force speed: "Overclocking"
[2:53:57] <%Fooguwu> but ur mom will get scared D:
[2:53:57] <+sauceonmommy> god i would kill for another kotor
[2:54:18] <%krispen_wa> has there ever been a droid that could use the force?
[2:54:22] <+krispen_wa> cause that would be rad
[2:54:24] <Gruhunchously> Overclocking, yeah
[2:54:33] <Meekest> There were in extended canon I think
[2:54:35] <%CalderGaming> there was a comic about that but it was bullshit
[2:54:36] <+maenos2> there was in legends I think.
[2:54:36] <Meekest> But that shit dont matter
[2:54:39] <%dekkitout> In EU I think, yeah
[2:54:40] <+welly_____> there was a clone trooper that could use the force.
[2:54:41] <Too_Much_Nukie> There hasn't. But there was a single non-canon comic about it that people talk about often.
[2:54:42] <%sweetestbeefs> the force is only for LIVING things
[2:54:42] <BurningAc3s> psaMenace
[2:54:43] <%justcallmebobplease> EU TOTALLY had those
[2:54:44] <+Sendrak70> R2 might as well use the force at this point.
[2:54:47] <Ipsenscastle> there totally was though and it was super dumb
[2:54:52] <+megaman_sentinel> think about that
[2:54:55] <Gruhunchously> There was that one droid from The Force Unleashed who could mimic using the Force
[2:55:00] <penitentpendant> I mean, theoretically you could build a 'bio droid' but it'd be weird
[2:55:01] <%CalderGaming> Luuke
[2:55:04] <Valentinius_Anodyne> Yeah, there was a joke comic about it but that;s it
[2:55:04] <Ipsenscastle> Luuuke
[2:55:04] <Too_Much_Nukie> EU DIDN'T HAVE FORCE USING DROIDS.
[2:55:04] <%krispen_wa> Luuuuuke
[2:55:04] <@SSaryn> WHAT
[2:55:05] <%toolofparanoia> Droids are not alive therefore cannot use the force
[2:55:07] <Gruhunchously> Luuke
[2:55:09] <%CalderGaming> bigger luke is a different thing
[2:55:09] <+Ruddagger> Luuuuke
[2:55:09] <+maenos2> Luukeand Luuuke
[2:55:10] <%dekkitout> Luuke and Luuuke
[2:55:11] <%Daxalog> Luuke
[2:55:11] <+gitgouda> LUUL what
[2:55:12] <%justcallmebobplease> Haha right, Luuke
[2:55:14] <%bread_assassin> LUL
[2:55:14] <%sweetestbeefs> that sounds dumb as shit
[2:55:18] <%GarbageQueenEllie> Ewwwwww they tried to Spiderman Him?!?!
[2:55:21] <BouzenJishitsu> Uluke
[2:55:24] <%Mr_Pylon> biggerluke is real?
[2:55:26] <%dekkitout> This was in Dark Empire, aka the basis for Last Skywalker
[2:55:26] <Gruhunchously> That's so dumb
[2:55:27] <Valentinius_Anodyne> Yep LUL
[2:55:27] <%Movemeister> LUL
[2:55:30] <%sweetestbeefs> THAT SOUNDS SO DUMB
[2:55:31] <+shadic7700> Thanks stupid
[2:55:33] <Gruhunchously> Luuuuke
[2:55:33] <huskarl_zap> luulke
[2:55:33] <LyriumSmuggler> Luke, Luuke, and Luuukey
[2:55:36] <Too_Much_Nukie> EU had a single non-canon comic about a droid that was implied to use the force and that's it. It was a 5 page joke.
[2:55:40] <+shadic7700> Thats*
[2:55:40] <ammobasket> DoubleLuke
[2:55:43] <%CalderGaming> bigger luke is a joke about the movies
[2:55:45] <%Daxalog> wow
[2:55:45] <@SSaryn> Bigger Luke can't hurt you. Luuke:
[2:55:54] <+megaman_sentinel> u can't blame George for that lol
[2:56:00] <KaiserMario> For all the shit the Spider-man clone saga gets, Scarlet-Spider is all right...
[2:56:09] <Too_Much_Nukie> In the EU clones started getting additional vowels added to their name as a rule.
[2:56:11] <+Dova573> I forget what was that old jedi master in the thrawn trilogys deal?
[2:56:13] <jmpeil> Wide luke.
[2:56:18] <%Daxalog> This is just the HORATIO from the endless series.
[2:56:19] <ammobasket> Luke, I can reach farther
[2:56:23] <%sweetestbeefs> this is the worst part of the game, by far
[2:56:43] <kenny_biff> Elmooo
[2:56:44] <Too_Much_Nukie> @Dova573 He was a clone of a dead jedi and jedi clones tend to go insane.

[2:58:46] <%Mr_Pylon> THIS should have been a cutscene
[2:58:46] <%Daxalog> this couldve been a cutscene fight
[2:58:48] <Too_Much_Nukie> @cafefunk Restored content
[2:58:57] <jmpeil> Elmo is gieff’s progenitor unit
[2:58:57] <%krispen_wa> Optimal systems failing master achieved
[2:58:58] <NitronStreams> Im waiting for the HK-52s to start walking in the room

[2:59:26] <%sweetestbeefs> center console
[2:59:26] <+EmotionalFatGuy> you think Elmo dreams of achieving optimal accuracy ratio
[2:59:27] <NitronStreams> Thats Rad
[2:59:35] <BouzenJishitsu> BioWares always been shit bawkKek
[2:59:36] <%Movemeister> This is the mountain before the ever so slightly smaller mountains
[2:59:41] <Too_Much_Nukie> People rag on Xenogears for having basically the entire second disk as a cutscene, but honestly this is a good example of why that's not a bad idea in some cases.
[2:59:48] <+megaman_sentinel> no
[2:59:51] <CureMode_> this part is the wrost of the restored content mod
[3:00:05] <%XeroSigmaPrime> No
[3:00:15] <huskarl_zap> Primarch HK 47
[3:00:31] <daiev> warning
[3:00:32] <+megaman_sentinel> start production
[3:00:35] <%XeroSigmaPrime> MORE HK 51S
[3:00:42] <%krispen_wa> how the hell does a galaxy not get run by HK units after this?
[3:00:59] <%CalderGaming> "self-destruct pls"
[3:01:06] <Too_Much_Nukie> Uh ohs
[3:01:07] <%sweetestbeefs> I will maintain that this whole section would be MUCH BETTER as a cutscene
[3:01:08] <KaitlynnHere> Now make the production line go reaaaaaalllllly fast
[3:01:08] <%GarbageQueenEllie> "Statement: I am God now"
[3:01:15] <%XeroSigmaPrime> YEYEYEYEA
[3:01:29] <%CalderGaming> Sometimes the bumping produces more meatbags
[3:01:31] <DemonsEcho272> I miss the KotoR fan remake.
[3:01:33] <KaitlynnHere> That camera angle
[3:01:39] <+cafefunk> so this is content cut from the final game? how was it obtained?
[3:01:45] <Too_Much_Nukie> Guys I just got a text from Little V and it looks like Pat got the bad end.
[3:01:50] <%krispen_wa> the restored content mod
[3:01:52] <penitentpendant> "We use our blasters to send them to 'Mating Jail.'"
[3:02:04] <Too_Much_Nukie> @cafefunk It was still in the game files. Kotor 2 also contained about 90% of Kotor 1 on launch.
[3:02:17] <%sweetestbeefs> Little V absolutely fuming rn
[3:02:32] <BionicPulga> nitrorifleWut
[3:02:40] <+cafefunk> I wonder why it was cut
[3:02:41] <%CalderGaming> unionize!
[3:02:47] <%XeroSigmaPrime> Thus begins... NIER AUTOMATA
[3:02:48] <%krispen_wa> Self actualizing murder bots. you love to see it
[3:02:54] <Meekest> They unionized
[3:02:54] <%GarbageQueenEllie> yeeeeeeaah DROID NASH YALL
[3:02:55] <%sweetestbeefs> isnt it?
[3:02:56] <Too_Much_Nukie> Yeah this ending is totally canon to SWTOR btw.
[3:02:56] <%XeroSigmaPrime> HK47 HAS BECOME GOD
[3:02:56] <NitronStreams> I for one welcome our new robot overlords
[3:02:58] <KaitlynnHere> Uh oh
[3:02:59] <+Ruddagger> @DemonsEcho272 moral of the story is never ever show off a mod until it's ready to release
[3:03:01] <%Mr_Pylon> Assassination Union
[3:03:01] <@SSaryn> OH SHIT THINMGS ARE HAPPENING AGAIN
[3:03:03] <%sweetestbeefs> makes you wish woolie saw it
[3:03:04] <Zebroneath> FINALLY
[3:03:11] <%AzureGale> The ending was all worth it
[3:03:12] <KaitlynnHere> See this is how the geth were created
[3:03:13] <%CalderGaming> so does that... go anywhere outside of SWTOR?
[3:03:18] <%Alazull> And then in The Old Republic HK just serves Revan and you kill him in a boss fight
[3:03:20] <%XeroSigmaPrime> WAit Woolie didnt see that speech?
[3:03:22] <Zebroneath> back to cool stuff!
[3:03:22] <%dekkitout> D:
[3:03:22] <Decahexa> Big Stink
[3:03:32] <+krispen_wa> Well considering KOTOR is not canon, no it goes nowhere
[3:03:34] <%sweetestbeefs> now the game is fun again!
[3:03:37] <+Ruddagger> hahahahaha
[3:03:37] <Too_Much_Nukie> @CalderGaming It gets mentioned in a few Legends novels.
[3:03:38] <%MidnightBurst12> rude
[3:03:39] <Gruhunchously> LUL
[3:03:45] <KaitlynnHere> I could hear him cry
[3:03:51] <%GarbageQueenEllie> Now time for the GOOD shit
[3:03:53] <KaitlynnHere> Myaaaaaa!
[3:03:53] <+megaman_sentinel> so who killed bao dor
[3:03:56] <Too_Much_Nukie> But nobody is writing for Legends outside of SWTOR now.
[3:03:59] <%Alazull> And the HK boss fight is like maybe halfway through the leveling dungeons?
[3:04:02] <Ids560> atton's lookin rough
[3:04:10] <SaltyAzteca> Airplane noises. In SPACE.
[3:04:15] <%krispen_wa> I remember there was a mod that had bao dur walking into a mine and dying here
[3:04:23] <Gruhunchously> HK has his own army of assassin droids
[3:04:23] <KaitlynnHere> Elmo wants to stream now
[3:04:27] <Too_Much_Nukie> Bao-Dur was supposed to sacrifice himself in the factory but it was never finished being written so who knows exactly _how_ he would have died.
[3:04:39] <%CalderGaming> @SaltyAzteca I mean... it IS Star Wars
[3:04:40] <%sweetestbeefs> put elmo back on the camera
[3:04:43] <%sweetestbeefs> he scream
[3:04:43] <Gruhunchously> @krispen_wa That's so stupidly hilarious
[3:05:25] <%sweetestbeefs> I imagine bao dur isnt dead, he just left and is chilling on a beach, drinking space martini's
[3:05:33] <%sweetestbeefs> YEAH WHERE IS HE OBSIDIAN
[3:05:35] <%Raiden_Breaker> psaGib psaGib_HF
[3:05:36] <%CalderGaming> what happened to the lighting in that last cut
[3:05:41] <$RealThiele> poochie left
[3:05:42] <+Ruddagger> his planet needed him
[3:05:45] <+EmotionalFatGuy> Bao-dun dead
[3:05:47] <Gruhunchously> Yeah happened to him...meh whatever
[3:05:49] <Too_Much_Nukie> Yeah Bao-Dur is just dead off screen and HK is busy starting a droid uprising.
[3:05:50] <%GarbageQueenEllie> Level up yer crust boy
[3:05:57] <%sweetestbeefs> he died on the way to his home planet
[3:06:03] <Too_Much_Nukie> As bad as the HK Factory is in this version at least it gives context for why HK is gone.
[3:06:05] <%Mr_Pylon> Poochie leaving will always be evergreen
[3:06:07] <penitentpendant> That (Force) Hand Wave from the writers
[3:06:14] <Valentinius_Anodyne> Baod-Dur left to use the restroom and everyone forgot to tell them where they were going
[3:06:18] <%RedSqurrl> "General... I need you to wake tf up." Then he fucking dips next scene lmao
[3:06:32] <%GarbageQueenEllie> I mean, really, would anyone honestly even care? Apparently not
[3:06:34] <%sweetestbeefs> He's one of the cooler characters too, it fucking blows
[3:06:42] <penitentpendant> "You will ignore we disappeared these characters."
[3:06:47] <%krispen_wa> bao dur isnt real. you have to let him go general
[3:07:00] <+Ruddagger> @sweetestbeefs I just fundamentally do not get the love for Bao-Dur. His voice makes my skin crawl.
[3:07:07] <Gruhunchously> Does he LOOK like he's doing okay?
[3:07:07] <GustauveVIII> @patstaresat should change the difficulty to normal or hard now
[3:07:10] <%sweetestbeefs> Woolie got legitimately upset at this part because of bao dur peacing the fuck out
[3:07:16] <+megaman_sentinel> add other members
[3:07:19] <%krispen_wa> oh yeah the difficulty
[3:07:44] <SaltyAzteca> The Star wars show or the youtube gaming show Kappa
[3:07:51] <Gruhunchously> I guess we can go back to normal mode now.
[3:07:54] <%GarbageQueenEllie> Nuuuuu hold my hand thooo BibleThump
[3:08:00] <%RedSqurrl> yeas
[3:08:02] <Gruhunchously> Yep, HK has an uprising to lead
[3:08:05] <huskarl_zap> yes
[3:08:05] <%sweetestbeefs> @Ruddagger robot hand, looks like darth maul, the whole "general" thing, his robot companion, but that's just me
[3:08:27] <Gruhunchously> You still love HK after all that?
[3:08:28] <Zebroneath> HK and Bao are gone for good
[3:08:30] <%toolofparanoia> Droids RISE UP
[3:08:33] <%sweetestbeefs> HK is a god now tho, he cant be concerned for mortal problems like yours
[3:08:39] <%RedSqurrl> He has robo disciples to train
[3:08:46] <+Ruddagger> @sweetestbeefs Yeah, but he's like, Darth Maul's softer duller baby faced cousin. I unno, it feels transparently 'cool design' to me.
[3:08:50] <+shadic7700> He has to go simp for Revan
[3:09:04] <Gruhunchously> I guess  they paid him well
[3:09:05] <%sweetestbeefs> @PatStaresAt change the difficulty back to normal, dont forget!
[3:09:16] <piknick_> damn  it pat. why u do the evil side
[3:09:21] <%GarbageQueenEllie> Even nationalist assholes have priorities.
[3:09:22] <Gruhunchously> He did
[3:09:26] <+EmotionalFatGuy> time to kill chodo habot and say he fell down some stairs
[3:09:32] <SaltyAzteca> Fuck. Busted.
[3:09:33] <ABakedDemon> change difficulty to hsrd
[3:09:36] <ABakedDemon> hard
[3:09:38] <%CalderGaming> just imagine doing, like Legion's loyalty mission in mass effect 2 and then he just leaves the game afterwards
[3:09:42] <Zebroneath> back to busted shit
[3:09:42] <$RealThiele> kzzzrk
[3:09:42] <@SSaryn> It's fun again yaaaaaaaay

As a data archivist please know I haven't followed you since your lavabeard green-greens days just to send you a virus. Please tell me we're cool?

[3:10:11] <Too_Much_Nukie> Same. Have you played with the DLC yet?
[3:10:14] <piknick_> the music in this game is so much better than the first one

[3:11:15] <Too_Much_Nukie> This game is so much more fun when you can blow shit up with your mind.
[3:11:16] <+NopeBadguy> in his defense, this game is just really easy in general
[3:11:23] <Zebroneath> I'll take that hit of being one guy.
[3:11:29] <Gruhunchously> Hey talk to that guy
[3:11:30] <+gitgouda> i like how you asked if that looked easy then 3 tapped a crowd

[3:11:53] <Too_Much_Nukie> You're killing them too fast with force crush, the animation isn't finishing.
[3:12:02] <%sweetestbeefs> and the only canon person to use it was a jedi LUL
[3:12:07] <Gruhunchously> @PatStaresAt Talk to that wounded guy back there
[3:12:11] <Zebroneath> omg
[3:12:22] <%GarbageQueenEllie> Soon you'll get to fight your favorite sith lord
[3:12:31] <+NopeBadguy> what if someone had a force crush on you
[3:12:41] <%krispen_wa> force enlightenment is great because it lets you skip 3 turns of buffing, but crush is just SO COOL
[3:12:48] <$RealThiele> just barely
[3:13:01] <ABakedDemon> AUGH
[3:13:07] <Zebroneath> Sucks to be you

[3:16:58] <%GarbageQueenEllie> Dream Team
[3:17:04] <Too_Much_Nukie> What I like about this is that Mandalore is being a manipulative scheming little bitch.
[3:17:09] <Gruhunchously> Let's goooooo
[3:17:11] <%Kilagn> Kilagn subscribed at Tier 1. They've subscribed for 26 months! Hard agree with what you said about Pokemon on the podcast. Same game but a lil different each time. As a solution everyone should play Digimon games instead since theyre better Kappa
[3:17:16] <%Daxalog> -hk
[3:17:20] <Meekest> Evil Lesbians and their Wookie
[3:17:21] <Too_Much_Nukie> Because he's trying to bring the Mandalorians back into galactic knowledge by leading the charge.
[3:17:28] <$Dakuu75> oh shit, I legit nodded off during that HK shit
[3:17:54] <Too_Much_Nukie> This would be Carth but he's dead in your save.

[3:18:24] <piknick_> i've never been able to do that
[3:18:41] <Too_Much_Nukie> I like how the Ravager doesn't even have shields.
[3:18:45] <SaltyAzteca> Just fly in, its fiiiiiiiiiine
[3:18:49] <Too_Much_Nukie> It's just held together by space magic.
[3:18:55] <Gruhunchously> @Too_Much_Nukie It barely has oxygen
[3:18:55] <$Dakuu75> star wars music is so good and recognizable
[3:18:58] <+megaman_sentinel> cool guys don't look at explosions
[3:19:08] <%sweetestbeefs> there's just a bunch of holes, it's fine
[3:19:11] <+shadic7700> It’s literally falling apart

[3:19:41] <arussoltzm> @piknick_ Dark side Revan dialogue choice with Atton in the beginning of the game

[3:19:52] <%sweetestbeefs> DOUBLE KATANAS WOO
[3:20:29] <%rumtumtugnutz> @reddpop_ The fact that Pat is getting tired of it doesn't help either

[3:27:43] <%krispen_wa> Nihilus is like Cthulhu if Cthulhu died from getting rammed by a boat
[3:27:51] <penitentpendant> It's moments like these I understand why they put Diminishing Returns on player AoEs

[3:27:56] <$Dakuu75> @PatStaresAt is it still on easy, from the HK shits?
[3:28:00] <+welly_____> ROFL
[3:28:04] <Onehandstan> force storm seems good
[3:28:14] <+megaman_sentinel> plant bombs ?
[3:28:14] <%sweetestbeefs> he's basically an eldritch horror, yeah
[3:28:20] <%Fooguwu> @Dakuu75 no
[3:28:24] <NitronStreams> it already back on normal
[3:28:29] <Gruhunchously> He's still kind of human but he's also an all consuming Force abomination
[3:28:35] <@SSaryn> LUL
[3:28:36] <penitentpendant> @Dakuu75 No, but force storm is still easy mode

[3:28:50] <+transporterthesequel> Darth Karen on the way to see the manager
[3:28:53] <+NopeBadguy> do you think kae'ryn is throwing up the devil horns whenever she blasts force storm
[3:29:03] <+Larc9783> Kreia was the best written character in this age of games
[3:29:13] <%sweetestbeefs> you really dont need any other items anymore, you're fully built for the game LUL
[3:29:24] <GustauveVIII> @PatStaresAt You have to search for 4 detonator locations around the first part of the ship before you can leave by the way.
[3:29:34] <%krispen_wa> Kreia is both the best written character and also the worst
[3:29:35] <+transporterthesequel> No she is clearly holding up her 3 year old receipt.
[3:29:45] <%krispen_wa> perfectly balanced as she would want it to be
[3:29:52] <Gruhunchously> @PatStaresAt Wait, find Colonal Tobin on the previous leve and talk to him before confronting Nihilus
[3:29:56] <Valentinius_Anodyne> Kae'Ryn has come to talk to their manager, and lets no item distract them from that
[3:29:57] <$Tuskor13> does anyone have an issue with the stream occasionally skipping backwards by a second or is my internet just scuffed
[3:30:03] <+welly_____> @krispen_wa v tru
[3:30:04] <%sweetestbeefs> this is the power of ANTIVAXX
[3:30:26] <%GarbageQueenEllie> Yaaay
[3:30:43] <Valentinius_Anodyne> @Tuskor13 Seems like it's on your end, Twitch be funky like that sometimes
[3:30:50] <penitentpendant> If or when I see screenshots of a proper remake of Kotor 1 or 2, my first question WILL be: "So how nerfed is force storm?"
[3:30:55] <%TheotherKristian> Now no employee can deny her access to the manager
[3:30:57] <%krispen_wa> Kreia when she starts preaching randian philosophy is insufferable, but the moments she lets up the facade and shows she cares about you are great
[3:31:29] <Gruhunchously> Yeah
[3:31:40] <%sweetestbeefs> oh yrah, that guy
[3:31:45] <%sweetestbeefs> that big loser
[3:31:52] <%krispen_wa> That Man
[3:32:25] <%GarbageQueenEllie> Her character arc is now complete
[3:32:35] <%krispen_wa> I wonder if Pat goes the waifu route with Visas
[3:32:46] <Zebroneath> embrace big evil
[3:32:55] <Gruhunchously> Those screams though
[3:32:57] <+megaman_sentinel> dreams of her dead ppl?
[3:33:01] <+shadic7700> Fart gas center
[3:33:08] <%krispen_wa> AAAAAH
[3:33:11] <+NopeBadguy> pretty sure one of those screams was a laugh
[3:33:12] <%sweetestbeefs> this scene is great
[3:33:14] <+Xalgar> Evil fart gas
[3:33:23] <Ipsenscastle> thats a weird laugh track
[3:33:25] <$RealThiele> spooky
[3:33:28] <Clundy> i heard a YAAAR
[3:33:29] <@SSaryn> This would be a lot more impactful if it was just actual regular ass fog but that was still very cool
[3:33:29] <%sweetestbeefs> CHARACTER COMPLETE
[3:33:29] <%toolofparanoia> psaBig Vengeance!
[3:33:33] <Gruhunchously> Visas gets some closure
[3:33:38] <+welly_____> Can she go light side???
[3:33:48] <%GarbageQueenEllie> This ship is so CRUSTY
[3:33:51] <Consumanist> the chamber of adult circumcision
[3:33:59] <Gruhunchously> @welly_____ Yes, and that scene is different
[3:34:01] <Ipsenscastle> @SSaryn sure looked like ass fog to me
[3:34:03] <%sweetestbeefs> nothing too significant
[3:34:05] <GustauveVIII> theres no real bonus to anything lol
[3:34:09] <Goodvibes99508> DId no one tell pat you get xp from security doors?
[3:34:10] <Schrozz> The chamber of CBT
[3:34:15] <+welly_____> ooh wha happen??
[3:34:23] <Zebroneath> I think just more force points for herself
[3:34:25] <%krispen_wa> bonuses arent real, this is just a game
[3:34:25] <Gruhunchously> ON the light side she gets gentle whispers telling her that she's fine and she's going to be okay and it's actually really touching.

[3:36:03] <%sweetestbeefs> blow open a bigger hole?
[3:36:08] <@commanderclaw> Cause it's load bearing?
[3:36:22] <%MidnightBurst12> a load bearing hole
[3:36:22] <Ipsenscastle> it's a load-bearing hole
[3:36:25] <%sweetestbeefs> i mean, it's probably a structural weakness @PatStaresAt
[3:36:27] <Gruhunchously> An explosion in a faulty area makes it more faulty?
[3:36:32] <+Xalgar> it's THICK hole
[3:36:41] <Phob05> If you blow up space then the ship can't fly!
[3:36:58] <+shadic7700> Was the poster I the simpsons a load bearing poster
[3:37:07] <Aydarkzero> just don't die 4Head
[3:37:07] <%Dregon_Azure> does load-bearing matter for a ship in space?

[3:37:26] <SaltyAzteca> BibleThump
[3:37:39] <penitentpendant> They mentioned earlier the shielding is keeping minimal atmosphere, probably something along the lines of 'overtaxing that system by making the hole too big to cover.'

[3:40:09] <%sweetestbeefs> honestly the story of this game is super good! its just that the game ran out of time and the gameplay is really lacking in some places
[3:40:22] <Gruhunchously> And Handmaiden, but not in this playthrough.
[3:40:23] <%sweetestbeefs> also the story could have better presentation

[3:43:49] <%krispen_wa> Yup
[3:43:53] <%sweetestbeefs> they really wanted people to go light side first
[3:43:56] <Gruhunchously> Yeah
[3:44:08] <dork_doggler> light side is canon path
[3:44:08] <Badgerconda_> Mando just kinda doofy
[3:44:10] <Valentinius_Anodyne> Yeah, Dark Side Kotor 2 is rough

[3:44:18] <Gruhunchously> He's in one of these rooms
[3:44:19] <GustauveVIII> @PatStaresAt Tobin is at the northeastern part of the ship
[3:44:19] <+NopeBadguy> I think he spawns after you place all the bombs?
[3:44:23] <+megaman_sentinel> no u haven't
[3:44:26] <%sweetestbeefs> DARK SIDE IS CANON FOR KOTOR 2 THO
[3:44:33] <Too_Much_Nukie> Spoilers: their next battle will be against the republic.
[3:44:36] <%krispen_wa> Dark Side is just the most cartoonish shit and yet the game keep saying "no some dark side is good though"
[3:44:38] <+EmptyMug> Is that lightside only?
[3:44:44] <%dork_doggler> @sweetestbeefs TOR says otherwise
[3:44:52] <Too_Much_Nukie> @sweetestbeefs no it isn't
[3:44:54] <waywardhavoc> ha

[3:45:19] <+megaman_sentinel> nani
[3:45:29] <+Goatllama> yep
[3:45:36] <%sweetestbeefs> i could have fuckin sworn that darkside was canon
[3:45:38] <shiibbae> crazy talk is more powerful than the Hand at this point
[3:45:39] <%sweetestbeefs> fuck me i guess
[3:45:50] <GustauveVIII> also canon is both handmaiden and disciple join you
[3:45:53] <shiibbae> but weilded by a more BIGGER idiot to power balance
[3:45:55] <%krispen_wa> canon meetra surik also forgetd she's a black hole in the force in the Revan novel so like...yeah

[3:46:37] <+NopeBadguy> mandalore said "watch my show on disney plus" and you gained influence

[3:46:40] <%Mr_Pylon> thanks for that Thief discount Mandalore

[3:46:52] <Aydarkzero> final boss?

When he says to Han "I know what I have to do...", it's because he's a fn UNDERCOVER AGENT. He's a follower of the light, but believing that the light isn't strong enough to destroy the dark, so he embraces the dark because he believes it's the onl

[3:56:55] <%krispen_wa> Yeah this is REALLY a light side game
[3:56:58] <Gruhunchously> Force FUCK YOU
[3:56:59] <%sweetestbeefs> GOOD ENDING
[3:57:02] <Goldenwolf98> oops
[3:57:07] <%dekkitout> I am become hungry, destroyer of pringles
[3:57:11] <+dante_must_die_exe> oh no LUL
[3:57:14] <arussoltzm> I remember the first time I got his mask in the Xbox version and my game crashed when I tried to look at in my inventory
[3:57:33] <%krispen_wa> I..
[3:57:33] <%TwoStarPlayersNik> He gets angry when the imperials learn of Rey's location, because he already knew where she were and he gets pissed because he's been trying to keep her a secret. He's trying to do it all by himself, to not get anyone else involved. He's a tragic character who can't ever succeed with what he's trying to do, but he's guided by the light in a very misguided way.  Then episode 8 came out and shit on every sort of character development for Kylo that JJ had set up.
[3:57:35] <Valentinius_Anodyne> rise from your grave
[3:57:38] <%krispen_wa> I... ship it?
[3:57:38] <%dekkitout> @arussoltzm That sounds like a feature more than a bug
[3:57:48] <silverira> @SGrim you clearly gave it more thought about it than the writers
[3:57:55] <UnsteadyFunk> @Valentinius_Anodyne Megustalations
[3:58:02] <xd_perolo12> do the secrete tunnel
[3:58:12] <Gruhunchously> @krispen_wa These two have some oddly shippy moments, yeah. There's even another one that wasn't restored.
[3:58:14] <%toolofparanoia> HMMM THAT SOUNDS FAMILIAR
[3:58:18] <%Hasmeister96> @toolofparanoia It's honestly unclear what he is cos he doesn't really have a corporeal form, and is just feeding off force sensitives
[3:58:21] <+landmammal> @xd_perolo12 throuuughhhh the mountain
[3:58:23] <%sweetestbeefs> isnt this ship about to FUCKING EXPLODE
[3:58:24] <%Fooguwu> terrible is right
[3:58:33] <%Mr_Pylon> biggerer evil
[3:58:39] <Goldenwolf98> Revan did a shit job fighting it then LUL
[3:58:44] <%TwoStarPlayersNik> So now he had to just come up with some jank ass way of still giving Kylo a light side redemption, but he had shit to work with thanks to Rian Johnson and the narrative became completely uninteresting
[3:58:47] <%GarbageQueenEllie> A war of belief... over how Star Wars should be written!
[3:58:48] <+shadic7700> Revan out there being cool
[3:58:48] <%Trenr> there's always a bigger fish
[3:58:49] <$SGrim> @TwoStarPlayersNik interesting take.

[3:59:19] <GustauveVIII> @PatStaresAt Mask is a quest item that passively grants +10 force points.
[3:59:23] <Meekest> Can you not wear it?
[3:59:23] <%krispen_wa> DON'T PLAY SWTOR IT'S A TRAP
[3:59:26] <%sweetestbeefs> you cant wear it.
[3:59:26] <silverira> key item?

[3:59:30] <%krispen_wa> not armor
[3:59:37] <Gruhunchously> No, you cannot be Darth Skeletor
[3:59:47] <UnsteadyFunk> SWTOR did Revan super dirty that game's fuckin awful. His redesign was kinda cool though.
