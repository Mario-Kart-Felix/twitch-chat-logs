[0:28:19] <%ramielthe5th> but no 22 year old should be called senior hahah!
[0:28:23] <%kullumanati> It’s very simple to understand
[0:28:23] <AKW4RD_BUFF4LO> FREEDOM NUMBERS
[0:28:24] <marrowjuice> i've always thought it was weird that junior wasn't the second one
[0:28:28] <@CaptainPileDriver> grade 13 doesn't exist here.
[0:28:29] <@Ranryu692> how do you spell that
[0:28:29] <%TubeMan642> Grade 13?
[0:28:31] <+fetrigon> burger burger I am confused. wtf is grade 10?
[0:28:33] <RyuuAoi> Well we do say 1-12 it's just that people are bougie
[0:28:34] <+blkalucard1> grade 13?
[0:28:37] <+shry7> how do you spell that word? seg-ep?
[0:28:41] <Lieutenant_Joe> As a kid, I assumed junior came before sophomore
[0:28:43] <Megaleg> No one is confused by 10th grade
[0:28:44] <%ThomasOfTroy> Cégep sounds fake and made up
[0:28:45] <%arkv01> bruh we got grade 15
[0:28:46] <@Ranryu692> ah
[0:28:47] <nochejunior> even more confusing lol
[0:28:49] <%Pukenasty> now your saying funny words we dont understand
[0:28:52] <@Ranryu692> that makes more sense than séjep
[0:28:53] <+ReallyBigRocks> I mean the division between Primary/Elementary school and High School is different depending on district
[0:28:55] <Lieutenant_Joe> And the only reason I knew freshman came first is because of Yugioh
[0:28:56] <@CaptainPileDriver> we just get shoved into college with like, no heads up cause our schools suck
[0:28:57] <AtisutoCurry> Canada sounds fake and made up
[0:28:59] <Profmcstevie> Say Jeff
[0:29:05] <+BigNerdSam> Do use Latin letters or gross French letters?
[0:29:07] <%Arek_1> Sajam.
[0:29:09] <%hereiam407> Whoah
[0:29:10] <nochejunior> 711
[0:29:17] <%PocketBearIllustrator> I hear anything below a 70 is considered a fail in the US. Is that true? Because that's fucked.
[0:29:18] <RyuuAoi> Cegep
[0:29:18] <$lotharrio> Yeah I imagine the different names for highschool levels has to do with a lot of it not being required for a large portion of American history.
[0:29:20] <%hereiam407> Completely different
[0:29:22] <sodamin1> just for the record though, this cegep stuff is only in quebec
[0:29:23] <%Cerabret100> So you don't have "middle" school in canada
[0:29:24] <brachydios777> I always wonder how Quebec is real
[0:29:25] <+xerotwo> Sajam Kappa
[0:29:25] <@CaptainPileDriver> it's also a bad gas station
[0:29:26] <%sandrews> Is Cegep short for something?
[0:29:28] <KosOrSomeSayKosm_> @Arek_1 you mean Jiyuna? Kappa
[0:29:29] <%Mathochism> sajamBob
[0:29:31] <%skycladbrent> skycladbrent subscribed with Prime. They've subscribed for 40 months! Hey Pat hope you're liking No More Heroes 3, gonna watch you play while I craft Coffee Biscuits in FFXIV. Also holy shit the housing system in 14 is awful. Been trying for over a month
[0:29:35] <AtisutoCurry> lmao
[0:29:36] <%TubeMan642> Yeah we got Middle school/ junior high fro 6-8
[0:29:36] <%hereiam407> Below a 60 should be a fail in the US
[0:29:37] <%THATGUY_789> In Aussie land we have kindergarten to 6, 7-12 for highschool and then University
[0:29:38] <Profmcstevie> It's a rush of info
[0:29:39] <sodamin1> if your in any other province its just 1-12 lol
[0:29:39] <+Laycas49> @AtisutoCurry Canada IS made up, It's just the north pole up there
[0:29:42] <+xerotwo> TEENAGE ANGST doodCrazy
[0:29:42] <Lieutenant_Joe> Yup
[0:29:44] <+ReallyBigRocks> Some places split 6 or 7-8 into Jr High
[0:29:45] <%hereiam407> A 60 to a 70 is a D
[0:29:46] <ExpressNode> Yeah I felt like that when I went to college
[0:29:47] <%JoshManVGH> PreK, K, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6 ,7 ,8, Freshman, Sophmore, Junior, Senior, Freshman, Sophmore, Junior, Senior, and then something Graduate for masters twice, then doctorate however many times
[0:29:47] <SunsetJack> I though it was around 12 where you leave elementary.
[0:29:54] <CaptainBright> Secondary school is just like that, Pat
[0:29:59] <@CaptainPileDriver> pay went to the 7-11 school, being taught to sell gas
[0:30:04] <%hewlettfan96> Help me
[0:30:18] <@CaptainPileDriver> get there once and be happy
[0:30:19] <@Ranryu692> and then celestial filed chargest
[0:30:26] <+blkalucard1> it like no
[0:30:29] <%PocketBearIllustrator> @hereiam407 Jesus. Here in Ireland, anything below 40 is considered a fail.
[0:30:37] <%megadblitz> did celestial feel soft?
[0:30:42] <+MowzerJ> you see the fucking universal house of truth?
[0:30:50] <%hereiam407> @PocketBearIllustrator Out of a 100?
[0:30:50] <Profmcstevie> I wish for their to be celestial battles of their own, Celestial 1-10
[0:30:55] <@CaptainPileDriver> can you pick your fights? like you can just ignore any fights you don't want?
[0:31:03] <%PocketBearIllustrator> @hereiam407 Yeah.
[0:31:09] <%hewlettfan96> What about it
[0:31:11] <%athuramn> I didn't notice when he stopped talking about school systems
[0:31:11] <KosOrSomeSayKosm_> yeah, strive be like that too
[0:31:13] <%maskofmichael> What game has the best match making system?
[0:31:14] <%hewlettfan96> What about Hades
[0:31:16] <+vaderxyz1970> So add 10 more levels?
[0:31:17] <Guigondi> i wish you a fun play session but i won't watch cuz spoilers
[0:31:19] <%Cerabret100> Floor 5 scrub here reporting for duty
[0:31:22] <@CaptainPileDriver> okay, i gotta go to work, have a good stream chat
[0:31:23] <Man_in_the_Red> its like SFV Diamond
[0:31:32] <Man_in_the_Red> its a joke to get there
[0:31:43] <%hereiam407> @PocketBearIllustrator And you do A,B,C,D,F grading?
[0:31:45] <Profmcstevie> Unpolished rank 1
[0:31:49] <Man_in_the_Red> NOT a joke to get past it
[0:31:50] <jmepik> so the Richter scale of rankings
[0:31:52] <Ekaelis> So thats where most of the community is huh?
[0:31:54] <Lieutenant_Joe> @hereiam407 her in my part of the US, anything below a 70 was a fail
[0:31:55] <%ArtoriasTheTrenchfighter> "Once you get really good, the game FORCES you to be a pissbaby"
[0:31:59] <%Cerabret100> Having a lower heaven and higher heaven?
[0:32:12] <%MooseIsGoose> Make more ranks 1000 more
[0:32:18] <%Esparsenior> 4 high rank survivors will ALLWAYS beat a high rank killer
[0:32:23] <%Esparsenior> It’s 4 vs
[0:32:28] <%Esparsenior> 1
[0:32:28] <+eanscrale> He DOES suck
[0:32:29] <%PocketBearIllustrator> @hereiam407 In secondary school, yeah.
[0:32:36] <Profmcstevie> Especially when you can SEE YOUR OPPONENTS CHARACTER IN STRIVE, some people exclusively dodge bad matchups for 10 floors dude
[0:32:44] <%Ipsenscastle> yeah we do
[0:32:53] <%cooldude69xx> CHEWSDAY INNIT
[0:32:54] <%BuckChuckman> Only thing with more ranks is that the higher ranks can get massive queue times, so my guess is even if there is a big skill gap its better than not getting games
[0:32:59] <%hewlettfan96> No we’re not
[0:33:01] <%tempestzephyr> CHooeseday
[0:33:02] <PlaidisTheNewPlaid> It's not even chewsday though
[0:33:08] <%Fooguwu> they're anti-choice
[0:33:09] <GarbageQueenEllie> Chews-day sounds borderline like a slur
[0:33:12] <%Ipsenscastle> Choese day
[0:33:13] <+condemned_15> Universal is releasing Halloween Kills on Peacock next month because of some mixed reviews
[0:33:21] <bigshedman> Jersey?
[0:33:24] <nochejunior> hahaha
[0:33:31] <%Dakuu75> Z Z zzzz...
[0:33:35] <notgarza> ok
[0:33:35] <%PocketBearIllustrator> @hereiam407 In college, it's either that or Distinction, Merit, Pass or Fail.
[0:33:36] <%hewlettfan96> Hahah
[0:33:37] <Goosenip> Wait that's how French Canadians pronounce it?
[0:33:38] <%horsesaredumb> isnt it Dimanche in french?
[0:33:40] <%hewlettfan96> Chewsday
[0:33:41] <brachydios777> Jersey?
[0:33:44] <%Esparsenior> At the end of the day, there won’t be any high rank killers anymore because it’s just going to be 4 swf Red rank survivors
[0:33:44] <PlaidisTheNewPlaid> I hate it, thanks
[0:33:45] <%hewlettfan96> Tahahaa
[0:33:45] <BlackOrchidKI> It doesn't even flow with the rest of the words
[0:33:49] <%ClericOfSparda> I saw a great TikTok on how fucked numbers are.
[0:33:49] <Profmcstevie> Wednesday, but the nes is silent
[0:33:49] <Lieutenant_Joe> …
[0:33:55] <%CapnBeefs> Fuck that
[0:33:56] <%ClericOfSparda> in French
[0:33:56] <%Esparsenior> Because why would you want to endure that as a killer
[0:33:57] <%sandrews> that's neat
[0:34:01] <tanarath> but saturday is the lord's day
[0:34:01] <nochejunior> lundi, manchedi
[0:34:08] <nochejunior> dieudi
[0:34:15] <Lieutenant_Joe> February but the r didn’t get out of bed
[0:34:17] <RyuuAoi> Gotta keep God day separate
[0:34:32] <avihaltmann> Dude what if there was a suda game about only 7 killers instead of 10
[0:34:40] <+griffball13> ban him
[0:34:41] <$lotharrio> Some of that is true
[0:34:42] <%Dakuu75> that guy mde a checklist
[0:34:54] <%hewlettfan96> What poopy baby
[0:34:58] <+Lobster_Lord> thoughts on the ass shots in that korean coomer game?
[0:35:00] <heartlesshealer> zapping is cool when it's done nicely
[0:35:04] <theloganbrand> Bet this dude plays action adventure games
[0:35:05] <xeros720> sea battle superiority
[0:35:08] <$lotharrio> And now we make fun of their teeth and accents.
[0:35:10] <i_chevalier> sunlight
[0:35:11] <%kyh9> What are we talking about
[0:35:17] <KosOrSomeSayKosm_> they had ALL THE SPICE ROUTES and used N O N E of it
[0:35:18] <Man_in_the_Red> @avihaltmann yeah, What If he did
[0:35:18] <verscoll> LUL
[0:35:19] <Profmcstevie> What the fuck do you expect me to season my food with, fucking rain
[0:35:19] <jumpyhugs> Invaded the world for spices, decided they did't wanna use any
[0:35:20] <%Dakuu75> So was Spain and at one time Portugal
[0:35:20] <theloganbrand> BUT TAKE THE SPICES ANYWAY
[0:35:21] <%UvBenServed> Monsters
[0:35:25] <%kyh9> LMAO
[0:35:25] <GarbageQueenEllie> buuuurrrrrrn
[0:35:29] <%kyh9> KATSUP AND CURRY THO
[0:35:30] <%kyh9> LMAO
[0:35:30] <%sandrews> damn that is true I guess I was thinking on an individual level
[0:35:32] <%Ipsenscastle> I'm British and that's super true
[0:35:33] <+fetrigon> yep
[0:35:37] <%athuramn> but why would they
[0:35:40] <CaptainBright> Gods, don't even get me started on the fucking British idiots who COLONISED parts of South East Asia
[0:35:40] <+Lobster_Lord> Indian spice lords
[0:35:42] <+vaderxyz1970> And then wasted all that navy in a war against Napoleon
[0:35:43] <TG_Cid11> They went to all those places that had all the spices and didn't learn to use them
[0:35:43] <%moonmintparadise> the only thing they imported was paprika, the spice that tastes of nothing
[0:35:43] <jorniev> only spread our culture never learn anything
[0:35:43] <Necnill> Accurate
[0:35:44] <jmepik> just chicken Tikka masala lmao
[0:35:45] <illTemperedSeaBass> If the Brits weren't such narcissistic shit-sticks their empire would still be around.
[0:35:45] <%kyh9> SAme with Japan tbh
[0:35:48] <Lieutenant_Joe> It was actually the Royal Navy PanicVis
[0:35:50] <%VictorVonLouche> Got a lot of curries here now
[0:35:50] <%athuramn> literally ANYTHING
[0:35:50] <%SovPho> butter chicken is pretty good
[0:35:50] <%hewlettfan96> Jesus Christ
[0:35:51] <+Casual_Nopon> Stole the spice but not the recipe
[0:35:52] <%kyh9> Japanese Curry <<<<<<<<<<<< Indian Curry
[0:35:53] <guiltyboya> An Empire For All Spices, not for learning how to use them!
[0:35:54] <i_chevalier> they hired people to cook for them
[0:35:55] <%kyh9> Fish and chips slaps tho
[0:35:56] <%athuramn> they made no effort
[0:35:57] <%stantheman_97> they had to conquer other countries to save themselves from their terrible cuisine and failed horribly
[0:36:01] <%kyh9> Fish and Chips and Tartar sauce tho
[0:36:01] <%brave_the_earth> just stuck with boiled cabbage
[0:36:02] <%hereiam407> @PocketBearIllustrator For college in the US, it was still letter grades overall
[0:36:02] <%arkv01> oi you like fish? and chips?
[0:36:06] <KosOrSomeSayKosm_> LUL
[0:36:08] <%KetsuoTaberu> woh euh
[0:36:10] <Profmcstevie> Pat it wasn't a voyage of knowledge is was for stealing and spreading
[0:36:13] <+griffball13> waha
[0:36:13] <%Wallabri> wodder
[0:36:14] <%Ipsenscastle> wahduh
[0:36:14] <%afronooch> wadder
[0:36:17] <%hewlettfan96> Ou fish n chips is peng
[0:36:17] <i_chevalier> Cause of the War!!
[0:36:17] <@Ranryu692> omg I missed a KotOR remake announcement???
[0:36:18] <tanarath> They learned how to cook real food, why polute it with english food?
[0:36:20] <GarbageQueenEllie> They don't cook w/ the spices, they SNORT them
[0:36:24] <ExpressNode> I hear country people do it too
[0:36:24] <%tempestzephyr> Japanese curry is apparently based on british curry
[0:36:24] <+Quinnman89> FootYellow
[0:36:24] <+vaderxyz1970> Wöder
[0:36:24] <Necnill> That's just London
[0:36:24] <heartlesshealer> wah er
[0:36:25] <%ramielthe5th> New Yorkers say WAHTAH
[0:36:25] <mechabutchzilla> thats how you say water
[0:36:26] <bigshedman> Wadder dose?!
[0:36:28] <%avihaltmann> avihaltmann subscribed at Tier 1. 
[0:36:28] <+tweedler92> waer
[0:36:28] <%moonmintparadise> Wa'ah
[0:36:29] <mechabutchzilla> like wadder
[0:36:30] <+ReallyBigRocks> you put a little extra stank on it too sometimes
[0:36:31] <vile_brand> are they the ones who misnamed seagulls?
[0:36:32] <sirrice77> I wonder if that's because if they adopted things from other cultures they would have to acknowledge them more as equals or at least admit they made better food
[0:36:33] <$lotharrio> Imperial Britain was like the tourists that go to other countries and only eat McDonalds.
[0:36:35] <getter_robo_nova> did I already miss the game?
[0:36:35] <%hewlettfan96> The UK invented bacon and eggs
[0:36:35] <illTemperedSeaBass> "Water with a d" is still perfectly acceptable.
[0:36:36] <UnsteadyFunk> I'm from Iowa and we sat WARTER
[0:36:36] <%sandrews> I'm Virginian and my area says wadder
[0:36:38] <+Lobster_Lord> Idk man, as an Indian dude, I think English chefs have come up with some cool variations on our cuisine.
[0:36:38] <%Cerabret100> age old french vs english rivalry
[0:36:39] <%cooldude69xx> What are they gonna do? invade your house?
[0:36:40] <%Fooguwu> wa'ah ba'ul
[0:36:43] <%Esparsenior> I’m British and we live with it by having people from other countries make fast food versions of their cuisine LUL
[0:36:45] <dabuurd> philadelphians say wooder
[0:36:47] <+KaguraRaion> @getter_robo_nova lol no
[0:36:48] <%moonmintparadise> The british suck have you seen their people ??
[0:36:48] <Profmcstevie> I'm going to trace your heritage to England just to make you sad
[0:36:48] <%hereiam407> @PocketBearIllustrator I am looking at Wikipedia for secondary (which would be 8-12/highschool in the US) apparently there are variances. Some high schools use the college versions
[0:36:49] <CaptainBright> Never, ever do not stop making fun of the British empire
[0:36:50] <%Ziegsy> HEY I SAY WATER FINE
[0:36:50] <+nicoleymcquack> this is an attack i wasn’t expecting on a thursday
[0:36:52] <%stantheman_97> we pronounce it like that too don't worry
[0:36:54] <%CapnBeefs> It warms the heart
[0:36:57] <%cooldude69xx> They're fake?
[0:36:57] <heartlesshealer> remember when they fucked up all those fossils?
[0:36:58] <%hewlettfan96> Fuck yoouu y’a utter bawbag innit
[0:37:02] <%Dakuu75> "Pat-UHHH can you get me some water-UUUHHH~!"
[0:37:04] <+griffball13> but thats just a theory
[0:37:04] <%VictorVonLouche> Blame the chavs
[0:37:04] <+nicoleymcquack> here we go
[0:37:07] <+shry7> new british lore just dropped
[0:37:10] <zanzibarian_hamster> You seen the purple burglar alarm thing?
[0:37:12] <KoryMccool> how did we start talking about the british
[0:37:15] <tanarath> New theory about the British just dropped.
[0:37:16] <%hewlettfan96> blad fan
[0:37:19] <%Dakuu75> Oh-fuck... here we go...
[0:37:26] <%CapnBeefs> Big theory time
[0:37:34] <%avihaltmann> Really glad this is what happens after I sub god bless your soul pat
[0:37:35] <%Ipsenscastle> That's a good point, we're the lesser of two evils, imagine the French Empire
[0:37:36] <supergoblinpunch> Here we fuckin go
[0:37:37] <%hereiam407> Gray it up
[0:37:37] <tanarath> And the Germans, Dutch, etc
[0:37:37] <CaptainBright> ...........................................
[0:37:41] <+Lobster_Lord> Germans are kinda shiit at food too tbh
[0:37:42] <guiltyboya> LUL As a French, I can only lie to myself and say that you are right, Pat LUL
[0:37:43] <%sandrews> oh man that a good prank..
[0:37:45] <sandsim> oh my god yes
[0:37:45] <bigshedman> I hate my dinner, get reckt France
[0:37:45] <%alphonseisbest> YES
[0:37:47] <%ramielthe5th> its some protestant thing, cuz Germans  ain't great cooks
[0:37:48] <%Esparsenior> Spite is the best motivator
[0:37:49] <%alphonseisbest> THIS TRUE
[0:37:49] <+nicoleymcquack> fish and chips is good tho
[0:37:50] <OldManDeckardCain> british literally had a war with some random iceland fishermen over some bullshit not that long ago
[0:37:50] <Necnill> Wrong, we're spiting ourselves. Proud British tradition
[0:37:50] <$lotharrio> That's some meta level thinking.
[0:37:52] <Profmcstevie> Eating shit food to own the french
[0:37:53] <+vaderxyz1970> Does Ireland have good food?
[0:37:54] <%Ziegsy> Wartime rationing and rich people. we never recovered
[0:37:54] <GarbageQueenEllie> Or even the germans. they and the dutch have good pastries
[0:37:55] <+grimywaifu_> Fun Britain Fact: It Sucks!
[0:37:56] <Man_in_the_Red> no its just the london stink killed their tastebuds so they didnt know until it was too late
[0:37:56] <%vivaldiva> oh no, our secret
[0:37:57] <%VictorVonLouche> French suck tbf, their food isn't that great overall either.
[0:37:57] <jmepik> take that back, German food is great
[0:37:57] <dabuurd> People from philly say WOODER and it triggers me
[0:37:58] <%hereiam407> Too much fighting wars to learn how to cook
[0:38:02] <brachydios777> Accurate
[0:38:02] <%alphonseisbest> PAT HAS LEARNED OUR SECRECT
[0:38:04] <Lieutenant_Joe> This is entirely believable
[0:38:06] <xanerts> German food sucks too
[0:38:07] <viewtifulr> if you really want to make italians mad, Break their spagetti in half
[0:38:10] <%VictorVonLouche> Germany have the best bread
[0:38:15] <%Piemono> God is punishing us by making us shitty cooks
[0:38:16] <%ramielthe5th> damn we getting smart time with Pat
[0:38:17] <+BigNerdSam> Flavor inspires sin
[0:38:17] <%Esparsenior> It’s mainly that only rich people enjoyed all the good food and spices, so it never spread around the country
[0:38:18] <thunderborn32> i mean who the hell eats beans at breakfast?
[0:38:19] <%stantheman_97> no one wants to conquer britain because they have nothing worthwhile
[0:38:20] <Cynical2DD> He’s still talking
[0:38:25] <dabuurd> hard work at the expense of your wellbeing lmao
[0:38:25] <%rumtumtugnutz> british food comes from years of people boiling literal garbage because everyone was poor but the king
[0:38:29] <%Retinolgaming> Viking food aint the best either. @PatStaresAt
[0:38:29] <some_brave_apollo> it's literally just WW2 rationing
[0:38:32] <@Ranryu692> the British put all their art talent points into music instead of cooking
[0:38:33] <heartlesshealer> church tells you that Gluttony is a sin so you can't have good tasting things or you'll overeat
[0:38:34] <%sandrews> ah but germans have good food associated with them
[0:38:34] <%Esparsenior> It’s had for the pools to eat food with Saphron in it
[0:38:35] <%maskofmichael> And thus eating bad food hurt their dialect
[0:38:35] <viewtifulr> actually im getting mad if someone broke my spagetti
[0:38:35] <%Ipsenscastle> singhetti
[0:38:36] <jmepik> love me some good Bratkartoffeln or Knödel
[0:38:40] <%Dakuu75> I think America has the WORST bread. it's so fucking sweet. everything has sugar
[0:38:49] <%sandrews> granted it's wurst but still

[0:43:58] <%Cerabret100> Asmon the character is annoying, but the dude himself seems cool
[0:43:59] <tanarath> Bloodbarn
[0:44:00] <%AlteisenReiseZ> I feel like Endwalker should be a "You" experience. take it at your own pace.
[0:44:01] <Profmcstevie> Bloodbarn double dog
[0:44:01] <%TheHateFish> Dude's funny, but the chat experience is actively detrimental to my health
[0:44:03] <%blue8moon> bloodbarn cart sounds like a riot
[0:44:03] <GarbageQueenEllie> Paige would know about BloodBarn
[0:44:06] <olaksi> asmongold is just varying levels of obnoxious, like most big streamers
[0:44:10] <+BigNerdSam> Asmongold closed the borders on Aether now I am really hesitent to invite people to FFXIV because we wouldn't be on the same Data Center.

[0:49:29] <$PigGuy800> i once saw a reddit thread for making the worst most worthless character in dnd 5e
[0:49:30] <tanarath> Or a shapeshifter druid
[0:49:32] <%Cerabret100> isn't kensai a melee thing?
[0:49:36] <jorniev> kensai IS LIKE A holy blade
[0:49:36] <%horsesaredumb> @alphonseisbest monk kinda
[0:49:37] <zanzibarian_hamster> 7 gives you optimum attacks per round
[0:49:40] <+vaderxyz1970> Sword Saint
[0:49:42] <jorniev> like vergil
[0:49:47] <jorniev> VERGIL
[0:49:54] <tanarath> @alphonseisbest No armour weeb warrior
[0:49:55] <%TheHateFish> It's clothy sword mage
[0:49:57] <GarbageQueenEllie> Kensai sounds like fucking weaboo shit
[0:49:59] <%alphonseisbest> oh like a Jedi kinda
[0:50:05] <jorniev> or more like jet stram sam
[0:50:09] <andimustmask> "sword saint"
[0:50:13] <heartlesshealer> so no armor to fuck up your spells
[0:50:14] <%alphonseisbest> so like SAM from14?
[0:50:23] <GarbageQueenEllie> Oh my god is Kai Leng a fucking Kensai
[0:50:27] <%Dakuu75> that sounds dope
[0:50:31] <Gigagoat> love a gigantic health pool
[0:50:33] <%alphonseisbest> hmmmm
[0:50:34] <Profmcstevie> Wizard with a two hander
[0:50:37] <%ShogunNoonto> its a monk sub class its in 5E
[0:50:40] <%alphonseisbest> does have BIG number?
[0:50:46] <%horsesaredumb> so like dragon age origins arcane warrior
[0:50:50] <Teyaric> It's the origional Gish class
[0:50:51] <%athuramn> unfortunately, does not work as well in Pathfindee
[0:50:55] <+Stormzcales_Lair> name that path one more time
[0:50:56] <zanzibarian_hamster> Basically you have decent attack but you can also get the silly mage buffs that make you hit so hard you can one shot everything
[0:50:56] <%Kyma1020> @pocketbearillustrator I've been watching his 14 vods and I'm glad he's enjoying it!
[0:51:01] <%logoth_> Horsey pally
[0:51:03] <%Cerabret100> The limited spells per day system of DnD fucks my survival horror brain in the shrieking fear
[0:51:07] <tanarath> huge melee number
[0:51:09] <+handsomerakshas> Thats so wizard pattie
[0:51:10] <zanzibarian_hamster> and be nigh on unkillable
[0:51:12] <+vaderxyz1970> Is it a Crit build or max damage build?
[0:51:16] <tanarath> Inquisitor is crazier
[0:51:26] <%alphonseisbest> can I build a Companion into that? or just the MC?
[0:51:32] <tanarath> big dispel magic
[0:51:39] <andimustmask> Holy Avenger
[0:51:49] <heartlesshealer> immune to charm is big
[0:51:50] <Profmcstevie> A fearless, sexless warrior
[0:51:52] <%PocketBearIllustrator> @Kyma1020 Yeah, say what you want about him (even I'm not a fan), but at least he's having a positive experience.
[0:51:52] <@GeneralSCPatton> Any plans to return to Planescape?
[0:51:58] <tanarath> @alphonseisbest old bg had multiplayer
[0:52:17] <%linSP> ballers gate
[0:52:19] <andimustmask> dispel magc lets you absolutely dunk on wizards
[0:52:23] <tanarath> Inquisitor @patstaresat also had true sight
[0:52:34] <%alphonseisbest> nice
[0:52:50] <jorniev> who was keldor again?
[0:52:51] <Tracazoid> 20 minutes more of Patcast
[0:52:52] <%alphonseisbest> anygood BG 1 companions to keep into 2?
[0:52:55] <+Mechanized82> KEEP TALKING
[0:52:57] <zanzibarian_hamster> spoilers?
[0:53:03] <tanarath> Inquisitor had 2x char level to dispell, which was great
[0:53:04] <@Ranryu692> @Cynical2DD thank you for ensuring that we don't get to the game soon
[0:53:12] <Sinetha> crumpSussy
[0:53:23] <%whyskeywolfe> That started in BG1 with Edwin and Dynaheir. They’d kill each other if you didn’t kick one out.
[0:53:24] <GarbageQueenEllie> And then you tell them to kiss
[0:53:26] <OzzySnek> >.> wait which game is this
[0:53:48] <+lulzysavant> WIGGLE WIGGLE WIGGLE
[0:53:51] <%Zebroneath> Viconia, yeah
[0:53:54] <jorniev> is this the same vod as the playstation?
[0:54:00] <%horsesaredumb> @OzzySnek baldur's gate 2
[0:54:09] <Profmcstevie> Playstation vod go boom
[0:54:10] <tanarath> If you had enough cha it could last sometimes
[0:54:10] <@Ranryu692> @jorniev no, that vod has already been deleted
[0:54:10] <%logoth_> I dont love evil and murder. IM GONNA KILL YOU??
[0:54:14] <%NopeBadguy> I also love Evil and Murder
[0:54:16] <zanzibarian_hamster> You also had catfights with the women, dunno if it went the other wya though
[0:54:17] <xeros720> the classic good vs. evil alignment debate
[0:54:20] <+Mechanized82> A real black and white decision
[0:54:27] <%DianaTheAscian> so time for evil and murder
[0:54:44] <%chance_h> Ah, lawful good vs murder hobo
[0:54:51] <%Kyma1020> yeah... XD
[0:54:55] <Profmcstevie> Fill a role
[0:54:56] <%alphonseisbest> oh god
[0:55:03] <scrumbotime> yyyyeeeeep that's why i'm almost assuredly going to be a cleric or druid, because i don't really WANT Shadowheart in my party and NEED a healer
[0:55:06] <%Pappajimbo> pillars 2 has that too its great
[0:55:08] <scrumbotime> in BG3
[0:55:17] <jorniev> was driddz really in BG2?
[0:55:19] <%linSP> Just do the divinity thing and make them be whatever class you want
[0:55:20] <GarbageQueenEllie> There's sooooo many
[0:55:27] <%alphonseisbest> any Good MODS to grab?
[0:55:33] <tanarath> BG2's pure fighter is also CE
[0:55:36] <+RoeDeerRootie> Pillars on normal also feels way easier than BG
[0:55:40] <zanzibarian_hamster> You basically are never without a rogue in BG2 at any point, it's a neat design
[0:55:50] <%Ipsenscastle> Dragon Age Origins made Wynne pretty much an essential party member
[0:55:54] <brachydios777> Is BG3 still in early access?
[0:55:55] <+vaderxyz1970> That's like playing D&D by yourself
[0:55:59] <@GeneralSCPatton> The real party members usually get unique buffs from their quests.
[0:56:02] <+AntiLuke> "Pillows of Eternity"
[0:56:13] <Reilata> oooh man
[0:56:14] <%Kyma1020> oof
[0:56:21] <dan_g_v> poof
[0:56:23] <GarbageQueenEllie> Played Pillars before BG and got my fucking ass kicked
[0:56:24] <%alphonseisbest> rip
[0:56:28] <+vaderxyz1970> Makes sense
[0:56:34] <bigshedman> Wait so they just die?!
[0:56:36] <%Agami23> i think thats the same in 5E
[0:56:43] <tanarath> Y E S
[0:56:47] <+ReallyBigRocks> Yeah disintegrate is brutal
[0:56:49] <Maleicus> hardcore
[0:56:53] <%whyskeywolfe> BG1 had a demo with a mid-level boss called Melium the Mighty just chilling on the second map.
[0:56:54] <%alphonseisbest> is there anything I should get a mod for in BG/2?
[0:56:56] <%Kyma1020> Like Disintegrate in 5E does that still
[0:56:57] <@GeneralSCPatton> In 3.5 and PF at least, you can cast Resurrection on the dust after a Disintegrate.
[0:56:57] <zanzibarian_hamster> Whens a DnD game gonna include a terrasque?
[0:57:02] <BoneofMalkav> Yep LUL
[0:57:07] <jorniev> i was watching random BG3 videos, how wild is it that those druids are down with child murder
[0:57:08] <Zeif00> fucking coffee biscuits
[0:57:11] <%BoxNavy> why do people craft coffee biscuits? i dont craft
[0:57:11] <%logoth_> "soon"
[0:57:11] <%Kyma1020> At least there are more options to bring the PC back
[0:57:12] <%skycladbrent> Oh I know it used to be worse lmao
[0:57:12] <%kyh9> What are we talking about?
[0:57:14] <%Piemono> They're still working on it
[0:57:16] <dan_g_v> it exists?
[0:57:17] <Profmcstevie> It almost always is "was worse before"
[0:57:17] <%Ipsenscastle> fucking nothinggggg
[0:57:19] <jbrowning134> they cancelled it
[0:57:19] <%Kyma1020> It was updated recently
[0:57:20] <%kyh9> in-development
[0:57:21] <%TheWinged7> still chapter  1afaik
[0:57:23] <%MoguManda> is it good yet?
[0:57:24] <+RelikaNox> Gathering stuff for more coffee biscuits as we speak wheeee
[0:57:25] <andimustmask> they're apparently mobing to a lottery system for housing in 6.0
[0:57:28] <%TheQuadrupleS> What are houses even good for in FF14?
[0:57:29] <Man_in_the_Red> LUL
[0:57:30] <%athuramn> 35% done ish
[0:57:31] <%xcompleasedad> @zanzibarian_hamster That'll be NEVER, because it would be too busted
[0:57:32] <thunderborn32> @zanzibarian_hamster the same time they include an astral dreadnaut
[0:57:33] <%cooldude69xx> Did they add hot orc babes yet?
[0:57:38] <GarbageQueenEllie> is it even halfway done?
[0:57:40] <andimustmask> which doesnt alleviate teh bot swarm issue at all,b ut it's a nice attempt
[0:57:44] <%Piemono> I don't know if they're going to add anything but ch. 1 till its done
[0:57:50] <%Piemono> they added new rolling
[0:57:51] <%linSP> Last time I played bg3 it ran better on my 3080
[0:57:51] <%Agami23> in a weird turn of events they updated balders gate 2 and added some content
[0:57:53] <%chance_h> It’s good but still in first zone
[0:57:56] <%Kyma1020> The early access will remain in Act 1
[0:57:57] <%Dopamien> @BoxNavy probably a favored market item to sell
[0:57:59] <%athuramn> yeah
[0:58:02] <%hewlettfan96> It’s a solid game I’ll give u that
[0:58:03] <scrumbotime> Early Access up to the end of the "first act", and they DID make rolling better, with the ability to In Roll applying of spell buffs and shit
[0:58:05] <BoneofMalkav> The status of Divinity Original Sin... I mean Baulders Gate 3 is the same as DUSK II, SOON (TM)
[0:58:09] <%itstreylar> you can choose what system you want
[0:58:15] <%Piemono> you can add your buff spells and stuff to the rolls
[0:58:16] <%athuramn> they added new rolling. weighted die like discos
[0:58:18] <%cooldude69xx> The game hates you even more!
[0:58:19] <scrumbotime> So if you wanted to Guidance a roll better you don't have to do it before you walk up
[0:58:21] <%Kyma1020> Rolling us fixed and you rest in the overworld now
[0:58:29] <%cooldude69xx> Plagues video was good
[0:58:35] <%linSP> dusk came out? Since when?
[0:58:37] <%chance_h> Improved rolls to add advantage (2dice) and adds you bonuses
[0:58:44] <+Stormzcales_Lair> Whats the timetable on them adding Dragonborn?
[0:58:45] <%Kyma1020> The ui is updated. Cutscenes are updated
[0:58:55] <scrumbotime> You can go Raw d20s or "Weighted dice"
[0:59:01] <%Kyma1020> The dice finally roll on screen
[0:59:05] <nochejunior> this feels like a patcast
[0:59:19] <jorniev> last i heard they did fix a lot of cutscene bugs
[0:59:31] <brachydios777> I feel BG3 won't be done till 2023 at the least
[0:59:34] <bigshedman> Considering the lack of Superbeastcast, I'm down with a longass Patcast
[0:59:37] <GarbageQueenEllie> interesting...
[0:59:38] <jorniev> and stuff like that
[0:59:47] <OverpricedTaco> @BoxNavy They're easy to make/gather the mats for and there's a leve quest you can spam in the Crystarium with a decent gil payout
[0:59:48] <jbrowning134> why cant the dice just be random?
[0:59:52] <%cooldude69xx> So the sweaty virtual DM fudges now?
[0:59:53] <scrumbotime> So if shit is going BAD it at least puts a toe or two on the scale to balance it
[0:59:53] <%logoth_> sqween
[0:59:55] <+BigNerdSam> on squeen
[0:59:56] <%Ipsenscastle> on-skween
[0:59:58] <%DianaTheAscian> so an easy mode toggle?
[1:00:01] <%Kyma1020> It is
[1:00:01] <jbrowning134> "scween"
[1:00:01] <%linSP> so it’s pseudorandom
[1:00:01] <PanicSwytch> Sqween
[1:00:05] <scrumbotime> @jbrowning134 you can still do that, it's optional
[1:00:08] <%athuramn> sqweenbussy?
[1:00:10] <%DianaTheAscian> easy roll*
[1:00:16] <%Monkeyweed21> dey woll on da sqween now
[1:00:25] <%athuramn> yeah, it was rough
[1:00:31] <%Meekest> You got your brain eaten huh
[1:00:31] <RyuuAoi> BabyRage
[1:00:31] <jbrowning134> HOLY SHIT, HE MISSPOKE LOLOLOLO
[1:00:31] <getter_robo_nova> did I miss No More Heroes lll?
[1:00:33] <%DianaTheAscian> I remember it was insane
[1:00:37] <%Kyma1020> Yeah that can be rough
[1:00:37] <Aoworth> Holy shit that original idea is SO BAD
[1:00:40] <Sol_Install> yea
[1:00:48] <%logoth_> Thats the lesson, never try
[1:00:50] <RyuuAoi> @getter_robo_nova No. Patcast first.
[1:00:51] <Hippoleon> That's kind of how it feels to play D&D 5E in my experience
[1:00:51] <%NopeBadguy> NEVER TRY
[1:00:53] <%NopeBadguy> That's me
[1:00:54] <+RealMichaelPhelps> omg kotot
[1:00:55] <Profmcstevie> The lesson
[1:00:57] <+AntiLuke> Haven't the XCOM devs discussed at length that videogame players will always feel that fair odds are unfair and lying to them?
[1:00:59] <%Pappajimbo> dice gods must be sated with gamers tears
[1:01:02] <Sol_Install> that terrible thing to inject into players heads
[1:01:03] <%athuramn> save scumming was also not convenient at the time
[1:01:05] <%Monkeyweed21> @PatStaresAt remember that XCOM cheats in the players favor
[1:01:05] <brachydios777> Lesson is,  never try
[1:01:05] <%linSP> you don’t fail if you never try
[1:01:08] <BearGoo> what place is he at
[1:01:09] <getter_robo_nova> @ryuuaoi  ok thanks
[1:01:11] <+Vigonept> if ya failed ya shouldnt have tried
[1:01:12] <%Meekest> LITERALLY same
[1:01:13] <%VictorVonLouche> Same lol
[1:01:14] <Treasure_Vault> No one has ever gotten past there.
[1:01:19] <+Vigonept> yeah thats fine
[1:01:19] <%Kyma1020> The thing with D&D that I don't think Video games will ever capture is how to roll with failure in mind
[1:01:21] <+RealMichaelPhelps> thats exactly what happened to me in divinity
[1:01:22] <jorniev> i cheated and then dropped it
[1:01:22] <%athuramn> yup
[1:01:23] <Treasure_Vault> That is the end of the game for most people.
[1:01:24] <%alphonseisbest> saame
[1:01:24] <PlaidisTheNewPlaid> yeah
[1:01:27] <+RoeDeerRootie> I hate DOS 1
[1:01:29] <%Meekest> I tried playing DOS2 and same
[1:01:30] <%NopeBadguy> @PatStaresAt Play with a friend?
[1:01:32] <Profmcstevie> Whens the question
[1:01:35] <PlaidisTheNewPlaid> That's fair
[1:01:36] <jorniev> it was way too heavy on my pc
[1:01:36] <willsin4fun> there's legends of more game past that but Ive never seen it
[1:01:41] <%VictorVonLouche> Like stick with 2 solos to not need to micro manage so much
[1:01:45] <%charp35> same
[1:01:46] <Teyaric> Skip Fort joy is a COMMON mod
[1:01:48] <%MostFrank> happened to me
[1:01:49] <%Kyma1020> Like DMs who make failures fun makes a campaign satisfying
[1:01:49] <Astrophizz> I played coop so I just worried about myself
[1:01:51] <Treasure_Vault> The second island is where the game ends for 80-90%
[1:01:52] <%linSP> I like the lore towards the end of act 3
[1:01:53] <%itstreylar> its more common solo, less common with a co-op partner
[1:01:55] <+Vigonept> What the skills? nah im fine with those
[1:01:56] <+yoyo5113> divinity was great coop
[1:02:08] <chaosbringer28> i didnt have too much issue with it, but i was playing in a full 4-man run of that game
[1:02:10] <GarbageQueenEllie> PAtfinder: Find your pats
[1:02:17] <%DianaTheAscian> I like the freedom but it can overwhelm people
[1:02:17] <SolSwagGuy56> Are we playing No MOre Heroes?
[1:02:20] <+DeRedBaron> so then you recommend the new pathfinder? cus i did do some of the first game
[1:02:22] <jorniev> really hard
[1:02:23] <%VictorVonLouche> You gotta break the game mechanics to win
[1:02:24] <Profmcstevie> Run with a group I guess
[1:02:25] <tanarath> It's hard, so minmax
[1:02:26] <%Ipsenscastle> people like player choice a lot less than they think they do. Everyone plays Mass Effect the exact same even - they just want the illusion
[1:02:31] <chaosbringer28> and we cheesed the everliving shit out of div 2
[1:02:33] <%DianaTheAscian> @SolSwagGuy56 No
[1:02:35] <%alphonseisbest> yea thats why i dropped off
[1:02:35] <jbrowning134> No more No More Heroes
[1:02:41] <@GeneralSCPatton> I prefer all this nerd talk
[1:02:43] <Angerest> Divinty
[1:02:43] <jorniev> that musical chairs song i stuck in my head its so good

[1:04:45] <xeros720> timed exclusivity patrick
[1:04:46] <%itstreylar> give it like a year
[1:04:46] <%Meekest> I agree with Pat
[1:04:46] <GarbageQueenEllie> idk man
[1:04:46] <rytisone> thanks Nintendo
[1:04:49] <dan_g_v> who cares about computer games?
[1:04:49] <brachydios777> Cause Nintendo
[1:04:49] <%Fiiib> Shame that some of the achievements are straight up impossible to get since they're brocken
[1:04:49] <%NopeBadguy> @PatStaresAt Probably because Nintendo said "Here's a big bag of money"
[1:04:51] <Blank9> did they ever make a non p2w version of let it die
[1:04:51] <Profmcstevie> Cos you're a mark Pat GET OOOOWNED
[1:04:51] <Mahbonk> 3 could use of a PC version though
[1:04:51] <%hereiam407> Soon
[1:04:51] <@Ranryu692> the Switch fucking sucks
[1:04:52] <miucsa51> it's only on switch
[1:04:52] <dan_g_v> nobody, that's who
[1:04:55] <%alphonseisbest> timed
[1:04:56] <%andrewofbob> Because you need that jacking-off motion control
[1:04:56] <CaptainBright> For the guys waiting for NMH3, just sit down and shut up, like I've been
[1:04:57] <%Monkeyweed21> @PatStaresAt switch only for a year or two at least
[1:04:57] <%DianaTheAscian> @PatStaresAt nintendo
[1:04:58] <bigshedman> NMH3 playthrough cancelled, we doing NMH1!
[1:04:59] <RyuuAoi> It's fine
[1:04:59] <heartlesshealer> Pat, remember Bayo 2?
[1:05:01] <ExpressNode> Must be a time exclusive on the Switch
[1:05:04] <%AntiLuke> If you really think about it talking about random pop culture BS is basically the same thing as playing a Suda 51 game.
[1:05:06] <%terry_irvin> RIGHT???
[1:05:06] <RyuuAoi> Ew Pc
[1:05:16] <%BoxNavy> ehhh rework that one
[1:05:16] <Blank9> diaper full

[1:05:21] <%hereiam407> Kryptonite but plug eh
[1:05:21] <%linSP> by the time NMH3 comes to PC, it’s gonna be on epic probs
[1:05:25] <Tennochief> PAT WTF
[1:05:26] <%Qsmash_> always with the pissing and shitting
[1:05:26] <%Ipsenscastle> I think that would just result in your dick getting burned off
[1:05:26] <xeros720> ask feel for a tweet
[1:05:32] <jorniev> DRINK KRYPTONITE PISS IN SUES EYES
[1:05:32] <Mvrdok_> Can't piss on him because magic barrier Kappa
[1:05:34] <%megadblitz> pat your eye just reflects off the sun YOU'LL ONLY MAKE HIM STORNGER
[1:05:34] <Coystick> B to B+
[1:05:36] <SolSwagGuy56> eh 4/10
[1:05:38] <RyuuAoi> Brown Kryptonite
[1:05:39] <Who_lio42> ninbendo says NO NO PC, PC BAD
[1:05:39] <%DianaTheAscian> Dipper full of brown cryptonite
[1:05:48] <Mahbonk> still hoping Bayo gets the Wonderfil 101 treatment and get ported to other consoles
[1:05:51] <%hereiam407> Do it
[1:05:51] <Mahbonk> *bayo 2
[1:05:52] <PanicSwytch> I love ur superman hot takes. It feels good to see butt hurt ppl complain
[1:05:56] <dan_g_v> wait, Tales really releases today?
[1:05:56] <ToneBacas> crikey
[1:06:00] <+shirou_kokkan> tales of arise!!!!!
[1:06:03] <Blank9> yeahhhh
[1:06:05] <KosOrSomeSayKosm_> but can you download it in time
[1:06:09] <jorniev> OOOY
[1:06:11] <%AntiLuke> Tales of Arise was the only AAA game at PAX west, and I still don't know how I feel about that
[1:06:11] <brachydios777> Remember brown kryptonite is real
[1:06:14] <Blank9> I hope it's good
[1:06:15] <jorniev> GOD DAMMIT
[1:06:17] <%Meekest> Oh boy
[1:06:17] <@Ranryu692> don't pet Paige for someone else, that's kinda weird
[1:06:19] <%afronooch> he did
[1:06:29] <%DianaTheAscian> oh yeah
[1:06:40] <Man_in_the_Red> but they pussed out
[1:06:42] <%RealThiele> casino scene :(
[1:06:43] <%Meekest> I agree with that
[1:06:47] <%cvp5127> and then
[1:06:47] <%kyh9> SO CLOSE TO SOMETHING GOOD
[1:06:47] <Coystick> The SITH LORDS ending was something
[1:06:52] <jorniev> IT was still kinda bad even with that
[1:06:53] <rytisone> nah man DESTINY
[1:06:54] <@Ranryu692> and then JJ Abrams was a hack
[1:06:54] <%Monkeyweed21> and they immediately backed out of all that
[1:06:55] <%alphonseisbest> yea that movie sux
[1:06:55] <%JoshManVGH> Last Jedi?
[1:06:55] <brachydios777> Rise of Skywalker ruined it
[1:06:55] <GarbageQueenEllie> If only they had stuck with a fucking plan
[1:06:59] <Blank9> they also didn't tell poe that the thing they were attacking wasn't goign to be an issue instead of killing them immediately
[1:06:59] <%Ipsenscastle> I liked old Luke, and the fuck you to destiny, but everything else was butt garbage
[1:07:00] <%kyh9> TLJ is less than the sum of its parts
[1:07:05] <%DianaTheAscian> ITS GREAT WHEN ITS NOT DESTINY
[1:07:07] <@Lion_kun> They sure ruined that.
[1:07:07] <%G_Thunders> Well yeah, the last 30 minutes undid everything interesting set up in the first 2 hours
[1:07:09] <%JoshManVGH> Last Jedi opened SO MANY cool ideas.
[1:07:10] <+red_cuppa> it was more about destiny than you could have ever imagined
[1:07:13] <%hereiam407> Its like they didn't have a plan
[1:07:13] <%Monkeyweed21> 2/3rds of Last Jedi are kinda bad
[1:07:14] <%Meekest> Its hard to blame TLJ for how bad ROS is
[1:07:16] <Coystick> Last Jedi had shades of the Sith Lords it's so frustrating
[1:07:17] <%Ipsenscastle> @kyh9 it sure is
[1:07:18] <%alphonseisbest> @kyh9 THIS!
[1:07:19] <%RealThiele> SOMEHOW
[1:07:21] <RyuuAoi> Cowards
[1:07:23] <@Ranryu692> TLJ is the third best Star Wars movie
[1:07:24] <olaksi> movie gave a middle finger to factory line disney crap, so the next one was the crappiest ever
[1:07:25] <%DianaTheAscian> I hate the destiny trope so much
[1:07:27] <%JoshManVGH> And then fucking didny just fucked it uo
[1:07:32] <%PigGuy800> PigGuy800 subscribed at Tier 1. They've subscribed for 19 months! woot 19 months, also random DRG reference "If you don't rock and stone, you ain't goin home."
[1:07:33] <jorniev> I STILL FEEL SO SAD FOR ROSE and her ACTRESS
[1:07:35] <%stantheman_97> it's filler
[1:07:36] <%cvp5127> its a road trip
[1:07:39] <%superc37> is it just me or did the stream get really quiet
[1:07:39] <+Stormzcales_Lair> like a Star Trek movie
[1:07:42] <%alphonseisbest> TLJ IS TRASH
[1:07:42] <%megadblitz> which one was last jedi again?
[1:07:42] <zenith0111> Youre... actually right
[1:07:44] <%logoth_> because hes a *MAN*
[1:07:44] <xanerts> luke dies
[1:07:45] <tanarath> oh nice, killer 7 is on steam
[1:07:46] <%AntiLuke> The Last Jedi would have been better if it had ended like half an hour earlier
[1:07:47] <%DianaTheAscian> @PatStaresAt its also really long
[1:07:49] <rytisone> it's a slow chase movie
[1:07:50] <%Monkeyweed21> Luke dies trolling some loser
[1:07:51] <%RealThiele> flying fucking Leia
[1:07:51] <%alphonseisbest> its pointless
[1:07:52] <@GeneralSCPatton> No occurrences. Not even a once.
[1:07:56] <Mvrdok_> TLJ was an executive production mess NotLikeThis
[1:07:57] <SilverFaustX> yes
[1:07:59] <%whyskeywolfe> They end the movie in exactly the same position they started it in, just with more dead rebels.
[1:08:00] <%DianaTheAscian> a long nothing
[1:08:02] <GarbageQueenEllie> It's a metaphor for how the films were written
[1:08:04] <%linSP> junk food filler
[1:08:05] <SilverFaustX> obey
[1:08:05] <brachydios777> Rise of Skywalker makes TLJ worse
[1:08:06] <%Meekest> LUKE DRINK THE BLUE MILK
[1:08:09] <dan_g_v> don't think just obey
[1:08:11] <%cvp5127> somwehow
[1:08:11] <%DianaTheAscian> OH YEAH IT IS
[1:08:13] <%JoshManVGH> I think there's some studio fuckery with that part
[1:08:15] <%Corporate_Redeemer> Follow the orders you weren't given or made aware of
[1:08:19] <%andrewofbob> Disney teaching kids to be obedient useful idiots
[1:08:19] <%hereiam407> Animal rights was the point of the movie
[1:08:19] <Blank9> just follow orders, and don't trust your best men
[1:08:20] <RyuuAoi> Was the latest trilogy a mistake?
[1:08:20] <zenith0111> I forgot about the casino thing
[1:08:22] <CaptainBright> gods, fuck casino planet
[1:08:25] <PlaidisTheNewPlaid> They tell Finn that war is bad
[1:08:27] <%ThomasOfTroy> There's that kid with the force, and THAT'S IT
[1:08:27] <%JoshManVGH> Except that war profiteering is bad
[1:08:28] <+YooShark_> YooShark_ subscribed with Prime. They've subscribed for 38 months! ababababa
[1:08:28] <%stantheman_97> always obey your commander even in the face of incompetence
[1:08:30] <%athuramn> stories don't have to have morals and lessons, they can just be shitty stories
[1:08:31] <+vaderxyz1970> The NOT GAYS was the result
[1:08:34] <%G_Thunders> Luke and Leia totally give up on their family member, so there’s that
[1:08:35] <Blank9> if you are in charge, withhold information always
[1:08:35] <+RoeDeerRootie> we made this 3 hour film to kill Luke, the end
[1:08:36] <%alphonseisbest> yup
[1:08:36] <bigshedman> Rose's actress getting bullied was terrible, but holy shit what an awful character.
[1:08:37] <%RealThiele> Hyperspace capable ships ruining space combat forever
[1:08:39] <%ClericOfSparda> what movie?
[1:08:39] <olaksi> for all the stupid shit in TLJ i can't understand complaining about not divulging your entire battle plan to a random fighter pilot
[1:08:39] <%alphonseisbest> AND SHOULD
[1:08:40] <sandsim> im baffled no one working on that movie was like this is dumb
[1:08:42] <%kyh9> The moral was SUPPOSED to be "Don't think about glory, think about the greater good" But the events don't add up to that
[1:08:43] <dan_g_v> just follow the orders we didn't tell you, it's your fault you didn't follow the hidden order
[1:08:43] <OldManDeckardCain> "capitalism bad" - a huge company
[1:08:44] <%Ipsenscastle> Rian Johnson has made/written some great fucking movies, I blame Kathleen KEnnedy
[1:08:46] <%hewlettfan96> Cheer500 I don’t like all the shite you say about The UKs food we may not have amazing syrup and burgers, but we have bacon and eggs!! Fish and chips and so much better candy than you Canucks and americants!! Also there is nothing wrong with being fat, there needs to be a fat acceptance movement similar to lgbtq rights, also rise of skywalker is worse than TLJ, TLJ had good idea badly executed, rise was just pure noise and no imagination.
[1:08:48] <Coystick> Remove Rose
[1:08:51] <$BlackMage66652> STOP BEING RIGHT, PAT
[1:08:52] <%kyh9> I usually do
[1:08:56] <RyuuAoi> Landon showed up I guess.
[1:08:58] <%kyh9> I just skip the Casino and finn plot
[1:09:00] <%kyh9> And nothing changes
[1:09:01] <+ReallyBigRocks> Yeah that probably wouldve developed into something if ROS wasn't such ass
[1:09:12] <%DianaTheAscian> wow
[1:09:17] <%sandrews> Benicio del Toro really got his paycheck and left.
[1:09:21] <%RealThiele> Relativistic speed weapons ruin lasers pewpew
[1:09:22] <Treasure_Vault> I never watched the new trilogy cause Rogue One was awful and I figured it would be more of that.
[1:09:23] <rytisone> like Chris Redfield in RE8
[1:09:23] <%Meekest> Because he got people killed Pat
[1:09:23] <%MugenSandan> I thought the moral was supposed to be about how failure is a good thing
[1:09:24] <Blank9> there was nothing about glory in poe's motivation, at all
[1:09:24] <Coystick> Make Snoke a Giant Sith Lich fuck he was almost cool
[1:09:27] <OldManDeckardCain> did you know most of the film budget went into stupid shit they didn't even use on that fakin planet LUL
[1:09:32] <zenith0111> Because fuck Poe
[1:09:38] <+ReallyBigRocks> Cuz he's ultimately just some pilot
[1:09:40] <%andrewofbob> Is there even a justified reason for keeping Poe in the dark?
[1:09:42] <%AntiLuke> Poe also doesn't come off as a glory hound, but as genuinely concerned
[1:09:43] <%JoshManVGH> @patstaresat do you think that Maz Kanada was sending them to talk to the dude wity the rose, or did she just tell them enough to get caught and talk to the actual guy they needed?
[1:09:44] <@GeneralSCPatton> "Just following orders" = Lawful Neutral cowardice and being a mindless cog.
[1:09:44] <%Ipsenscastle> they don't even need to explain it, they didn't even bother to reassure him that they had a plan at all
[1:09:44] <%Meekest> Pat the opening scene is him getting a ton of people killed why would they tell him
[1:09:45] <olaksi> it's kind of implicit in a war situation though?
[1:09:49] <+grimywaifu_> at no point do they explain why its bad he wants to know
[1:09:49] <+ReallyBigRocks> Thats how army mans work
[1:09:49] <%ClericOfSparda> oh, star wars. yeah, that casino plan was useless
[1:09:50] <RyuuAoi> ..........is Star Wars bad?
[1:09:53] <%Kyma1020> If they said Poe was a glory seeking hothead and his character showed it then Yeah I would get that
[1:10:03] <Blank9> he's the best pilot they've got and did insane shit in the movie before this
[1:10:03] <Man_in_the_Red> always has been
[1:10:04] <%linSP> Star Wars is bad
[1:10:10] <Blank9> like he shoudl already be the new luke skywalker
[1:10:11] <%kyh9> Yeah
[1:10:12] <%G_Thunders> Because Rian finished the script before Episode 7 was even fully finished iirc
[1:10:13] <%alphonseisbest> most of it
[1:10:14] <%Agami23> star wars was never good
[1:10:17] <Mvrdok_> @PatStaresAt iirc it was because "he can't follow orders so it's better to not tell him the plan so he doesn't fuck it up"
[1:10:19] <%JoshManVGH> Star Wars IS bad, but it CAN be fun
[1:10:22] <%cvp5127> only jedis
[1:10:25] <%kyh9> It's very shallow
[1:10:26] <%PocketBearIllustrator> Is Star Wars just THE THING to hate on these days?
[1:10:28] <%hereiam407> If they stopped focusing on the Jedi, it would fine
[1:10:28] <Coystick> Star Wars is an aesthetic
[1:10:28] <%stantheman_97> originals good, prequel bad but entertaining, sequels bad
[1:10:30] <ToneBacas> not surprised
[1:10:32] <SilverFaustX> mikelivePalpatine
[1:10:32] <%Ipsenscastle> I fucking hate the Jedi
[1:10:33] <%kyh9> Rogue One review
[1:10:41] <%RealThiele> JJ abrams mystery box storytelling has always been shit SURPRISE!
[1:10:42] <%ThomasOfTroy> The core material for Star Wars is terrible at this point, the extended universe stuff is INCREDIBLE
[1:10:44] <verscoll> NotLikeThis NotLikeThis NotLikeThis
[1:10:45] <%TheWinged7> nah fuck that  gimmie more rogue one style stuff
[1:10:46] <%Agami23> but did it subvert your expectations??
[1:10:47] <ToneBacas> it has to be potato chips then
[1:10:47] <+Mechanized82> Jeff Gerstmann said it best, Star Wars is for kids.
[1:10:48] <%ClericOfSparda> Star Wars is bad and I love it
[1:10:51] <%JoshManVGH> I wish Leah had shot Holdo with the stungun
[1:10:51] <xanerts> stormtroopers
[1:10:52] <RyuuAoi> Boooo
[1:10:52] <%kyh9> ...I like Solo tho.  It was the closest thing to actually expanding the Star Wars world
[1:10:54] <Blank9> why wouldn't rey be the new han solo scrappy rogue, and finn the new jedi
[1:10:54] <zenith0111> What a wait of a fantasy universe
[1:10:54] <%NopeBadguy> So general audiences are the reason Star Wars is bad
[1:10:55] <xanerts> at ats
[1:10:56] <%NocturneNovember> And then it will be
[1:10:57] <%Ipsenscastle> I just want the cool spaceships goddamnit
[1:10:58] <olaksi> mandalorian was so goddamn overrated
[1:10:59] <%DianaTheAscian> @PatStaresAt I always say star wars is the movie equivalent to sonic with how people talk about it
[1:10:59] <%AntiLuke> Westerns need to come back
[1:10:59] <xxshadowxx416> SEQUELS REALLY BAD
[1:11:00] <+Stormzcales_Lair> so good Star wars can't be movies
[1:11:00] <zenith0111> waste*
[1:11:02] <+ReallyBigRocks> I still like it tho
[1:11:04] <%hewlettfan96> No Star Wars is good, it’s what you make of it, it is just badly handled
[1:11:06] <@Lion_kun> Until the season 2 finale lol
[1:11:06] <+HaloIsA> mando is kind of Bounty Hunter with a heart of gold
[1:11:07] <Coystick> Subvert deez nuts
[1:11:08] <brachydios777> Thank God for Filoni
[1:11:09] <ToneBacas> LUL
[1:11:09] <%Ipsenscastle> gimme fucking Rogue Squadron you fuckers
[1:11:10] <%alphonseisbest> boo
[1:11:14] <+vaderxyz1970> Bounty hunter with a heart of gold
[1:11:14] <GarbageQueenEllie> subvert DEEZ NUTS
[1:11:16] <%kyh9> My Expectations were that Star Wars was good
[1:11:18] <%Agami23> you expected a good movie, it subverted them by being fucking trash
[1:11:20] <Aoworth> George Lucas was just the luckiest hack in the world
[1:11:20] <%Monkeyweed21> Star Wars is about 1 family being tormented by an evil space wizard
[1:11:22] <%kyh9> I expected Star Wars to be good
[1:11:23] <SaltyAzteca> X wiiiiiing
[1:11:23] <Profmcstevie> Subversion is not a value in and of itself
[1:11:25] <%hewlettfan96> NO ONE CAN DECIDE THATS WHY ITS BAD
[1:11:26] <zanzibarian_hamster> Surb you Enthusiations
[1:11:29] <%RealThiele> rogue squadron done by the maker of WW84 LUL
[1:11:29] <ErikFeral> "1 Family Ruins An Entire Galaxy"
[1:11:29] <@Lion_kun> Subvert expecting a good story.
[1:11:33] <ToneBacas> @kyh9 subvert harder Kappa
[1:11:33] <%andrewofbob> Hey, chat, what's your expectations on the new Matrix movie?
[1:11:35] <Treasure_Vault> What's good about Star Wars? Lightsabers and the force? Cool ship designs?
[1:11:37] <%alphonseisbest> but PAT what if Endwalker Subverts ur ass? LUL
[1:11:40] <%NocturneNovember> Rian Johnson may make a bad Star Wars, but Knives Out was pretty good
[1:11:44] <%G_Thunders> GoT did it even worse imo
[1:11:45] <%stantheman_97> you shouldn't subvert expectations just for the sake of subverting expectations
[1:11:52] <zenith0111> Subverting expectations never works out in stories
[1:11:53] <%kyh9> @ToneBacas Subvert your idea of good writing
[1:11:57] <%Kyma1020> Star Wars is a campaign settings handled by terrible writers
[1:11:57] <OldManDeckardCain> that film was "subverting expectations" every 5 minutes
[1:12:03] <%Meekest> Palpatine was behind it all
[1:12:07] <%ThomasOfTroy> Detroit Become Human is a GREAT example of that
[1:12:08] <RyuuAoi> @andrewofbob Fear
[1:12:09] <%sandrews> it ruined movies that actually are trying to subvert expectations.
[1:12:11] <+Mechanized82> People have built SW up to be more than it is due to the excellence of the surround world building content that no longer exists.
[1:12:15] <%RealThiele> i expect the new matrix movie to be garbage with cool worldbuilding
[1:12:16] <xanerts> George R R Martin said something similar to this
[1:12:17] <+ReallyBigRocks> I liked TLJ
[1:12:20] <Profmcstevie> PAYOFF>>>TWISTS
[1:12:21] <jorniev> WHATS IN THE BASEMENT
[1:12:23] <olaksi> George Lucas just copied the hero's journey bullet point by point
[1:12:23] <%Monkeyweed21> hey 12 minutes
[1:12:27] <%JoshManVGH> I think if Rain Johnson had creative control of the whole trilogy, it would have been something special.
[1:12:28] <%DianaTheAscian> THE NEW TO THE OLD THE OLD TO THE NEW
[1:12:29] <%cvp5127> remember snok LUL
[1:12:30] <Blank9> I went below your expectations
[1:12:30] <+BoboDaHobo> subverting expectations by continually doing the same thing but slightly different
[1:12:30] <ToneBacas> @kyh9 yeah I know, I don't care for Star Wars in any way
[1:12:32] <%kyh9> I commend Bioshock 2 for not doing a big stupid twist.  Its story is better for it
[1:12:33] <bigshedman> Surprise he's lame LUL
[1:12:35] <%hereiam407> Whats the force, is it magic? Midichlorians
[1:12:42] <wembleyttv> Snoke is a FUCKING JOBBER
[1:12:42] <%linSP> the only good twist is the ol dick twist
[1:12:43] <%cooldude69xx> But can Snoke beat Kai Leng?
[1:12:45] <%G_Thunders> If you can’t predict a twist whatsoever, then it’s a bad twist
[1:12:45] <zenith0111> Snoke was..... weirdddd
[1:12:46] <%RealThiele> another JJ abrams mystery
[1:12:46] <%sandrews> he was over there in the corner
[1:12:48] <%JoshManVGH> He was waiting for a void to gill
[1:12:51] <rytisone> wish he was actually huge
[1:12:52] <ErikFeral> Intergalactic, Giant Man of Mystery
[1:12:54] <%hereiam407> Somehow, he was a clone
[1:12:55] <Man_in_the_Red> the implication was he was a huge poser pretending to be an emperor type
[1:12:57] <@GeneralSCPatton> Snoke was a space mayor of a minor backwater or something
[1:12:57] <%Meekest> CAN SNOKE BEAT KAI LENG
[1:12:58] <+vaderxyz1970> Snoke is the most stupid name i ever heard
[1:13:06] <%ClericOfSparda> Snoke was an annoying jobber
[1:13:09] <%Ipsenscastle> Snoke fucking sucked
[1:13:12] <Aoworth> IT WAS ME, AUSTIN

[1:13:12] <ToneBacas> why would Snookie be like that
[1:13:14] <%JoshManVGH> Fucking pkaplatine clone shit so fucking bad
[1:13:14] <SilverFaustX> mikelivePalpatine
[1:13:15] <GarbageQueenEllie> that is sooo boring
[1:13:17] <%RealThiele> somehow
[1:13:18] <Tracazoid> Somehow Palpatine returned
[1:13:21] <brachydios777> At least people still talk about Star Wars, nobody talks about GOT anymore
[1:13:21] <xanerts> palpatine was behind it all
[1:13:22] <AstrodropGaming> Somehow, Palpatine returned
[1:13:22] <+Mrbaconator> that doesn't even subvert my expectations tons of people expected that
[1:13:22] <olaksi> also undermines the entirety of the 6 first movies
[1:13:26] <%whyskeywolfe> The idea that Abrams thought “I grew a whole tank full of Snokes for some reason” was an answer to some question? Was amazing.
[1:13:27] <%cvp5127> THE DEAD SPEAK
[1:13:27] <%hewlettfan96> Kylo ten fucking sucks
[1:13:28] <+ReallyBigRocks> Yeah bringing back Palpatine was dumb, should've been Plagueis if they were gonna do that
[1:13:29] <%Piemono> How did we get on to TLJ?
[1:13:29] <%Agami23> remember when snoke was really big until he wasent?
[1:13:30] <Man_in_the_Red> but then the emperor came up and nullified anakin skywalker's only redeeming action
[1:13:31] <%ClericOfSparda> Snoke was Kei Ling in disguise!
[1:13:31] <ExpressNode> Pulpatine except he's an evil glass of orange juice
[1:13:32] <Profmcstevie> Oh it's Ganon again
[1:13:32] <%Meekest> I feel like Snoke being a jobber would've been fine if they kept Kylo evil and in charge for TROS
[1:13:34] <SaltyAzteca> IT BROKE NEW GROUND
[1:13:35] <%JoshManVGH> Fortnite Ruined star wars
[1:13:36] <+Mechanized82> Snoke sucks, but he was really powerful, just incredibly stupid because he let his guard down.
[1:13:36] <%sandrews> you see instead of Smoke and mirrors we changed the m to a n
[1:13:37] <%kyh9> FORTNITE TIE IN THO

[1:14:11] <+vaderxyz1970> Palpatine was the greatest sith lord of all time because of BAD WRITTING
[1:14:11] <GarbageQueenEllie> i think that was the point?
[1:14:11] <%RealThiele> thanks twist
[1:14:13] <%Meekest> Isn't the point that revenge is bad
[1:14:14] <xeros720> you were the last boss?
[1:14:14] <%kyh9> HAHAHAHA
[1:14:18] <jorniev> AND A FACE TATOO

[1:14:21] <olaksi> TLJ killed star wars and we should be thankful
[1:14:23] <Man_in_the_Red> actually you did kill the Pizza Bat CEO in NMH1
[1:14:23] <%kyh9> NMH1 HAD A GREAT TWIST THO
[1:14:23] <AstrodropGaming> Palpatine returned and immediately started chewing the scenery
[1:14:25] <%BoxNavy> absolutely
[1:14:28] <@Lion_kun> Remember the Han Solo rip off who does nothing  but betray them lol
[1:14:29] <ErikFeral> Baby BatMite
[1:14:29] <+Mechanized82> The story for Fallen Order is better than any of the SW movies
[1:14:30] <%hereiam407> Wasn't Suda less involved with NMH2?
[1:14:33] <%BoxNavy> revenge is stupid and dumb
[1:14:33] <%skycladbrent> NMH2 wasn't directed by Suda though
[1:14:37] <%AntiLuke> "I made it bad because it's funny"
[1:14:39] <%Monkeyweed21> BuT Pat ReVenGe is baD aNd NoT FuLfillInG
[1:14:39] <%kyh9> To be fair, he didn't write NMH2
[1:14:41] <%Agami23> its meant to make you feel that revenge is hollow and not worth it.
[1:14:42] <Zero_Jacks> death match pizza jr is TRUE PAIN
[1:14:43] <Man_in_the_Red> but no one remembers those missions
[1:14:43] <Blank9> "it's supposed to be bad because revenge isn't satisfying!!"
[1:14:44] <%Agami23> except that sucks

[1:14:51] <ErikFeral> "Revenge, the most worthless of causes" - Suda51

[1:14:58] <%DianaTheAscian> @PatStaresAt y they do that?
[1:14:59] <miucsa51> yes and it great
[1:15:01] <brachydios777> NMH1 had a vey good twist Villan
[1:15:03] <zenith0111> Is NMH3 getting kinda bad? Ive been seeing some talk about it
[1:15:05] <verscoll> LUL
[1:15:06] <ToneBacas> I hope Kojima named Norman Reedus' character in Death Stranding like that to be bad on purpose too
[1:15:18] <%hereiam407> I enjoyed that part  though
[1:15:22] <SaltyAzteca> @jorniev standards
[1:15:24] <%Meekest> Let things be cool sometimes
[1:15:25] <%kyh9> Wait, he DID write NMH2, he didn't direct it tho
[1:15:28] <miucsa51> no he did wrote 2 but he didn't directed
[1:15:30] <Man_in_the_Red> @zenith0111 no its great, we're just reminiscing about 2
[1:15:31] <verscoll> that theme remix was great too
[1:15:31] <xeros720> nmh3 is great, it's budget is just bad
[1:15:32] <Profmcstevie> Kojumbo you bastard you did it again

[1:16:03] <%superc37> so like a penis
[1:16:03] <%Questiy> To be fair, I thought Henry's dark secret that he was closer to Travis than he wanted was funny
[1:16:06] <GarbageQueenEllie> a sickle chain
[1:16:06] <%RealThiele> p o k e
[1:16:08] <%Monkeyweed21> taller than you?
[1:16:09] <%Agami23> spears and glaives are radical
[1:16:09] <%kyh9> So anything taller than you?
[1:16:16] <%kyh9> The tall weapon
[1:16:16] <%G_Thunders> Cid in FF7R-2 is gonna be cool
[1:16:22] <%NopeBadguy> KUSARIGAMA
[1:16:24] <%kyh9> Xaldin
[1:16:24] <%Agami23> no, swords though
[1:16:25] <+LandOfTheWay> i get the idea behind the batt jr fight, but i still think the themes would've worked better if the no.2 boss Alice killed him first, robbing travis of his revenge and making the final battle tragically meaningless
[1:16:25] <KosOrSomeSayKosm_> spears should be in more videogames and they should have the insdect glaive moveset from monhun
[1:16:26] <Man_in_the_Red> No More Heroes 2 gave us playable shinobu so yes it did happen
[1:16:27] <%Fiiib> More characters need should use nun chucks
[1:16:27] <%DianaTheAscian> Polearms are busted to
[1:16:28] <%cooldude69xx> A lot of real polearms looked like bullshit fantasy weapons too. It would be agreat excuse
[1:16:30] <%Axellogic> Polearms are rad
[1:16:31] <%RealThiele> Naginata baybee
[1:16:31] <@GeneralSCPatton> POLEARMS COULD HAVE POLE VAULTING MOVES
[1:16:32] <Coystick> A Nagitama
[1:16:34] <%EdenOfLove> Skyrim has greatswords
[1:16:40] <%AlteisenReiseZ> That's why Nioh 2 is great
[1:16:44] <wembleyttv> That Guan Yu pole arm is so freaking cool
[1:16:47] <ErikFeral> I want more chain-swords, or kunai with chain
[1:16:57] <Treasure_Vault> Most dudes had a spear, historically
[1:16:58] <%ThomasOfTroy> They were literally the most important class of weapons for thousands of years, and yet polearms just get shit on and ignored
[1:17:02] <Aoworth> Pointy stick has served humanity extremely well for millenia, yeah
[1:17:05] <%kyh9> THEYRE ONE OF THE MOST COMMON WEAPONS IN HISTORY
[1:17:05] <%Ipsenscastle> Every time a boss has a polearm they're fucking radical
[1:17:05] <Profmcstevie> It's not even fancy, its LONG AXE
[1:17:06] <@Ranryu692> Spears were more common than swords, historically
[1:17:08] <%kyh9> SPEARS ARE SO NORMAL
[1:17:08] <+griffball13> a spear is a basis of all weapons
[1:17:09] <%kullumanati> kusarigama are awesome
[1:17:09] <brachydios777> How do we feel about old NEO btw?
[1:17:11] <Treasure_Vault> If you were just a farmer? Give him a spear and tell him to stand there and poke
[1:17:11] <%kyh9> WHYA RE THEY SO RARE
[1:17:12] <GarbageQueenEllie> A rock. Just a hand-sized rock.
[1:17:12] <bigshedman> It's also weird because spears are WAY more effective than swords.
[1:17:13] <Agami23> warpicks are cool
[1:17:17] <OldManDeckardCain> spears are pleb weapons LUL
[1:17:19] <Coystick> What game has the most satisfying whip?
[1:17:20] <%superc37> pat you should REALLY play nioh 2, that has 2 polearm class weapns
[1:17:20] <%kyh9> REY SHOULD HAVE HAD A LIGHT-SPEAR
[1:17:20] <Blank9> chain/whip in general is used pretty often
[1:17:23] <%cvp5127> spears are op
[1:17:27] <@Ranryu692> it's why I want Ephraim for Smash
[1:17:28] <%Evil_John_Cena> i find it weird how many shooter games have bows in them
[1:17:29] <+Casual_Nopon> pointy stick = good
[1:17:30] <Ardailec> Spears are boring bruh
[1:17:31] <zhukis> you could get 100 spears for the manhours in making a nice sword
[1:17:31] <%logoth_> Castlevania
[1:17:34] <%TheQuadrupleS> But Swords tho Kappa
[1:17:34] <+LandOfTheWay> bayo 2?
[1:17:34] <Djinnazz> Bloodborne?
[1:17:35] <%DashXero> Bloodborne.
[1:17:37] <Profmcstevie> Spears are for infantry, swords are for protagonist
[1:17:38] <$PigGuy800> i like the absurd great axes from dark souls, yhorm's great machete being my favorite
[1:17:38] <%cvp5127> bayo?

[1:17:40] <wembleyttv> Also Lu Bu's Axe pole arm is also so freaking cool
[1:17:40] <@Ranryu692> probably a porn game
[1:17:41] <%Arek_1> Polearms were the battlefield weapons. Swords were sidearms.
[1:17:43] <HollowMan190> all of drakengard  and Nier have a spare

[1:17:50] <%stantheman_97> spears were by far the most common weapon in history in every culture yet it gets basically gets nothing in media
[1:17:52] <@GeneralSCPatton> Threaded Cane
[1:17:52] <brachydios777> Castlevania  4 maybe
[1:17:52] <heartlesshealer> for fighting or utility whip?
[1:17:57] <%linSP> The most common weapon is fist
[1:17:58] <$lotharrio> Bayonetta has a good whip
[1:18:09] <olaksi> but spear doesn't represent moving down people who are too poor to afford as good armor as you do, so it isn't as cool as swords
[1:18:12] <wembleyttv> Persona 5 strikers Ann's whip is cool
[1:18:13] <%Treuan> Deep rock Galactic not Dragoon

[1:18:35] <%sandrews> blunt weapons like mace is cool too not enough love there
[1:18:37] <Man_in_the_Red> Spears arent cool as swords tho, thats why oblivion took them out and not spend time animating it
[1:18:38] <Who_lio42> Deep rock Galactic, not FFXIV DRG
[1:18:39] <%linSP> yah ff4 was out yesterday
[1:18:41] <Treasure_Vault> Vindictus had all sorts of cool weapons. Weird amount of work for a f2pay game
[1:18:41] <Blank9> CHICKEN, ARISE
[1:18:42] <%cooldude69xx> @stantheman_97 Its seen in media as a "commoners" weapon, the sword was more expensive and thus a "Hero's" weapon
[1:18:43] <ExpressNode> Thats great. I have to wait until next week until I get my copy of the game
[1:18:44] <%hereiam407> Are we doing Arise instead of NMH3?

[1:19:14] <%andrewofbob> I've had a Full English that included  black pudding
[1:19:14] <+LandOfTheWay> @jorniev true, but i guess my point is that we could preserve the themes of the game while still giving a satisfying final boss. the game doesn't HAVE to be un-fun to make its point
[1:19:16] <@Ranryu692> did Boris Johnson write that?
[1:19:17] <Tennochief> what?
[1:19:21] <heartlesshealer> ?????????
[1:19:23] <%BoxNavy> bri'ish coneyPOGNT

[1:19:25] <HeroToxiko> @brachydios777 yes the lets just be warframening is going smoothly i see
[1:19:34] <Profmcstevie> Not only stupid, but loud and stupid
[1:19:37] <heartlesshealer> Just don't shame people for shape, that's it.
[1:19:37] <%linSP> chips for dinner, UK is crazy
[1:19:37] <+grimywaifu_> rise of skywalker is the worst star wars movie
[1:19:42] <%kyh9> I mean that's true
[1:19:46] <Coystick> I haven't even seen it lmao
[1:19:47] <@Ranryu692> Rise of Skywalker might be the worst one
[1:19:48] <jorniev> @LandOfTheWay eeeeh? maybe he thought diferent at the time?
[1:19:48] <%brave_the_earth> agreed
[1:19:49] <%Piemono> yeah
[1:19:50] <xanerts> i mean yeah
[1:19:51] <CaptainBright> RoS is a sleepshow
[1:19:52] <%DianaTheAscian> yeahhhhhhh
[1:19:52] <Man_in_the_Red> having 2 bad movies instead of 1 bad movie tends to be worse
[1:19:53] <%kyh9> I agree
[1:19:57] <%sandrews> oh damn
[1:19:58] <wembleyttv> Roast dinner fucking sucks
[1:20:00] <%RealThiele> JJ abrams magnum opus LUL
[1:20:01] <ErikFeral> I just want a Lightsaber that changes shapes like a Lantern Ring... but still burns. Imagine Hard Light Constructs as hot as the sun.
[1:20:01] <%NocturneNovember> RoS was more boring. I felt things watching TLJ. Not good things, but things.
[1:20:01] <miucsa51> NUCLEAR TAKE THEY ALL SUCKED
[1:20:01] <wembleyttv> I hate it
[1:20:02] <heartlesshealer> yeah
[1:20:02] <%kyh9> Only consoomers say otherwise
[1:20:03] <jorniev> damn
[1:20:05] <OldManDeckardCain> last jedi and rise are both atrocious
[1:20:05] <%whyskeywolfe> I’m angrier at TLJ. RoS is just dismissible.
[1:20:07] <Man_in_the_Red> and rise of skywalker is 2 bqd movies crammed together
[1:20:08] <%JoshManVGH> Rise was hilariously terrible. It's 3 hours of s movie YELLING at the previous movie
[1:20:08] <%DashXero> ROS is a failure to "Yes, and..."
[1:20:08] <brachydios777> ROS is much worse
[1:20:12] <%stubborndeer> star trek is the worst star wars movie
[1:20:12] <%brave_the_earth> I'd have to watch attack of the clones first
[1:20:14] <%andrewofbob> Personally not seen RoS; should I keep it that way?
[1:20:15] <jorniev> attack of the clones?
[1:20:16] <%TheWinged7> kill ben swolo
[1:20:16] <wembleyttv> Attack of the clones is NOT a bad move the last part of attack of the clones IS SO GOOD
[1:20:17] <%DianaTheAscian> At least that movie is funny bad
[1:20:17] <%whyskeywolfe> You can’t remember the dagger?
[1:20:17] <GarbageQueenEllie> Attack of the Clones is even better than Casablanca
[1:20:18] <%stantheman_97> it's three movies in one
[1:20:20] <jorniev> FUCK PADME
[1:20:21] <%hewlettfan96> Rise of skywalker is the most boring Star Wars film I’ve ever seen
[1:20:22] <OldManDeckardCain> search for the mcguffin
[1:20:22] <%sandrews> Rise of skywalker feels like ride at disney land.
[1:20:24] <%BYAKURENLOVER763> obi wan goes to the lady gaga planet with the clones
[1:20:24] <@Ranryu692> gotta get to the maguffin planet
[1:20:25] <SilverFaustX> make clones
[1:20:25] <verscoll> they fly now?
[1:20:26] <%kyh9> Something about a dagger
[1:20:26] <radregice> "emperor palpantine has somehow returned" is the whole plot
[1:20:26] <%Ipsenscastle> I've no interest in ever watching the sequel trilogy again
[1:20:26] <28moogles> video game bullshit, something about a knife?
[1:20:27] <jorniev> SEX AT PADME
[1:20:27] <olaksi> TLJ at least challenged the next movie to do something more interesting, and jj abrams ended up going *faaaaaaart*
[1:20:29] <%sandrews> like a bad one
[1:20:29] <%Meekest> Padme is being assassinated targeted
[1:20:30] <%RealThiele> THE BULLSHIT DAGGER
[1:20:32] <wembleyttv> Like Yoda fights for the 1st time was SO COOL
[1:20:32] <%DianaTheAscian> @PatStaresAt whos funding the droid army
[1:20:33] <%JoshManVGH> Get a dagger to guide them to a map
[1:20:33] <%Kyma1020> follow who was trying to kill Padme
[1:20:34] <%brave_the_earth> I was mad after the skywalker one
[1:20:34] <heartlesshealer> Vader Loses a hand that's the thing
[1:20:34] <PanicSwytch> For clones or skywalker?
[1:20:35] <miucsa51> Somehow palpatine returned
[1:20:36] <%Wallabri> uhhhh defeat.... bad guys....
[1:20:36] <+grimywaifu_> there are only two great star wars movies
[1:20:36] <xanerts> palpatine is evil
[1:20:37] <Djinnazz> to stop that Fortnite broadcast.

[1:20:59] <@Ranryu692> yeah, the dagger with the death star damage on it
[1:21:00] <@Lion_kun> Remember force healing
[1:21:00] <%Piemono> The Emperor has a secret fleet of death star ships
[1:21:01] <%stantheman_97> yeah the sith dagger and the planet coordinates
[1:21:02] <getter_robo_nova> I've finished NMH3 a few days ago and I have the confidence to say it's the most Suda of Suda games since TSA and I love it
[1:21:03] <%BoxNavy> the width of the sith

[1:21:06] <CaptainBright> fucking RoS had you travel to 6-7 PLANETS for the shit story

[1:21:11] <%Zebroneath> they try to find the mcguffin to find the plantet where Palpatine is
[1:21:12] <AstrodropGaming> Palpatine must die
[1:21:14] <%TheWinged7> all i know of that movies plot is the stupid maguffin daggerthey have to chase down 3 times
[1:21:14] <%sandrews> Fetch quest then water rain fight then palpy
[1:21:15] <%DianaTheAscian> @PatStaresAt I actually can't answer that
[1:21:17] <%RealThiele> THE DAGGER IS ROS
[1:21:17] <Treasure_Vault> Blow up the Death Star?
[1:21:18] <@Ranryu692> @patstaresat thats because you don't play Fortnitw
[1:21:19] <jorniev> DAGGER THAT DOES DEATH STAR DAMAGE?
[1:21:20] <@Lion_kun> Kylo and Rey kiss and then Kylo disappears in a puff of smoke.

[1:21:25] <+ReallyBigRocks> There WAS a dagger

[1:21:36] <%PigGuy800> stop secret sith fleet? i think
[1:21:36] <SilverFaustX> it was a uncharted thing in space
[1:21:37] <rytisone> to find spot on death star
[1:21:37] <+ReallyBigRocks> It was a puzzle or some shit
[1:21:37] <BigYanno> They're doing things because "Somehow Palptine Has Returned™"
[1:21:37] <HeroToxiko> oh wait i remember, the movie introduced the fucking starforge and immediately destroys it
[1:21:37] <brachydios777> Death Star Dagger

[1:21:50] <gingerbonez> Sidious, Spaceships, Running, Dagger, Save Chewwie, Mind-Kiss, Talk-with-dead, Profit
[1:21:52] <CaptainBright> remember when they had to get C3PO to translate that gat dang dagger
[1:21:53] <TheFramedWarlock> They need the dagger to get the GPS rock to get to palpatine and kill palpatine

[1:22:27] <%ThomasOfTroy> Elijah wood is a hero
[1:22:28] <%stantheman_97> Palpatine had a stupid sith sex cult
[1:22:29] <%seththeslime> so not the star forge
[1:22:30] <%cvp5127> LUL
[1:22:30] <heartlesshealer> The ships wouldn't even have to do anything. Just park them near suns and you win
[1:22:32] <olaksi> i really hate when fantasy/scifi authors raise the stakes by increasing the scale to more and more ridiculous degrees
[1:22:32] <+luketrapwalker> It should have just been Eclipse from the EU
[1:22:35] <+Queenemereldas> so they could find the wreck of the death star
[1:22:36] <@Ranryu692> each star destroyer had a planet-killer cannon on it
[1:22:37] <%cvp5127> did you know
[1:22:37] <%sjay662> Elijah Wood

[1:23:34] <+condemned_15> LUL
[1:23:35] <%sandrews> Would of been better to just have everyone there be a clone by palpatine?! Like have one actor do all this?
[1:23:35] <%augusm> augusm subscribed at Tier 1. They've subscribed for 29 months, currently on a 29 month streak! time to boost noots
[1:23:36] <Coystick> They just mine Star Destroyers
[1:23:41] <Djinnazz> @brave_the_earth technically when the guy showed up on stage during LA Comicon, but yeah.
[1:23:42] <%Kyma1020> When they announced Palpatine was alive in Fortnite is when I knew that Rise of Skywalker was going to be shit
[1:23:49] <RyuuAoi> Literally. That simple.
[1:23:49] <+ReallyBigRocks> JJ was too busy retconning every single plot point from TLJ to make new ones
[1:23:49] <@Ranryu692> @blank9 he only started making them right before RotJ, so maybe none were ready yet
[1:23:50] <Maleicus> i like how the destroyers died because they didnt know how to go up
[1:23:52] <thunderborn32> we still getting upset about things we cant do anything about?
[1:23:53] <+toficque> who's whipping the slaves
[1:23:54] <%JoshManVGH> They needed a dagger to guide them to the broken deathstar to get a hyperspace map to go to a planet surrounded by blackholes to kill palpatine before his fleet of planet destroyers ravage the galaxy.
[1:23:54] <%RealThiele> BUT MYSTERY BOX STROY THO
[1:23:58] <Blank9> THE DEAD SPEAK
[1:23:59] <%kyh9> Here's the question: does Disney hard reboot now or do they just focus ENTIRELY on the Mandalorian stuff?
[1:24:00] <MechanizedGentleman> Star Destroyers arent mined, they're grown in big vats
[1:24:00] <@GeneralSCPatton> You would need more slaves than there were clones
[1:24:00] <$realm_forge> SITH CULTISTS FUND UMBRELLA
[1:24:03] <+nicoleymcquack> a lot of movies really relies on alternate media to tell the story, like hey if you read that one time comic we made you’d know this fun fact!

[1:37:12] <%hereiam407> He's attempting Arise
[1:37:15] <+ReallyBigRocks> Japan hates PC gamers

[1:37:20] <olaksi> having to fiddle with port settings isn't that uncommon
[1:37:22] <%alphonseisbest> on't buy Japanese games on PC
[1:37:25] <PhantomKnightfire> is arise in beta ?
[1:37:28] <%Monkeyweed21> @ToneBacas but the last Tales game had a perfectly fine port and FF has had good ports for years now
[1:37:31] <%sandrews> Japan hates PC
[1:37:33] <%Dakuu75> damn dude... a game in 2021 with NO options on the menu... Covid must've been rough for these devs
[1:37:38] <+kewlmyc> What is he even trying to do?
[1:37:38] <AstrodropGaming> Been a while since I've seen a game actively avoid you playing it for an audience
[1:37:40] <SunsetJack> So art director of the new God of War revealed Thor's design apparently lol
[1:37:44] <ExpressNode> I already bought it for my XSX though so I guess I dodged a bullet

[1:40:52] <%afronooch> works fine for me
[1:40:52] <%hereiam407> Steam even works with emulators well
[1:40:55] <%the38bandit> acg said the xbox controller didn't work
[1:40:55] <%alphonseisbest> works fine with a p5 controller
[1:40:56] <%Ipsenscastle> this is why PC isn't worth it for me
[1:40:56] <+JustToWatch> WORKS FOR ME
[1:40:57] <HeroToxiko> playstation ports baybe

[1:41:04] <+ReallyBigRocks> hey Pat it works for me, is that helpful?
[1:41:04] <%hewlettfan96> Jesus Christ
[1:41:05] <%Dakuu75> @PatStaresAt just boot up your Windows Chess and teach us soemthing lol
[1:41:05] <@GeneralSCPatton> The age old answer to all tech support. Works for me.
[1:41:06] <%HotSauceFiend> IS this a sign to go back to play no more heroes?
[1:41:09] <luftraumm1> works for me /s
[1:41:10] <%JoshManVGH> That's a hilarious limitation if it works
[1:41:10] <miucsa51> but all jokes aside this isn't a good look
[1:41:10] <%Agami23> ah yes, the best comment when dealing with problems. "works for me"
[1:41:17] <+ReallyBigRocks> you can just stream MY gameplay instead
[1:41:19] <%hewlettfan96> We’re still discussing things I want games
[1:41:21] <sodamin1> "works for me"
[1:41:24] <heartlesshealer> fair
[1:41:29] <Treasure_Vault> You are the troubleshooter
[1:41:35] <%AgniBrandt> Did you preload it?
[1:41:40] <PhantomKnightfire> lmao
[1:41:42] <Treasure_Vault> Wherever there is trouble, you are there to shoot it
[1:41:46] <%ShogunNoonto> pat being pat
[1:41:49] <zenith0111> LUL
[1:41:51] <%AgniBrandt> I preloaded it and wonder if that's what fucked it up
[1:41:53] <amonimis> apparently it's capped at 144hz
[1:41:58] <radregice> IT KNOWS
[1:42:02] <%AntiLuke> *Barges in to thread* "Works for me" *Doesn't elaborate folder* *Locks thread*
[1:42:03] <olaksi> i think people are saying you can get the controller to work, not that this isn't an issue...
[1:42:04] <radregice> that's fucked
[1:42:05] <%Meekest> I WANT TO BEEEE--*skip*
[1:42:05] <miucsa51> LUL
[1:42:05] <+ReallyBigRocks> I just doesn't work on the menus?
[1:42:07] <+ekodrop> lol
[1:42:08] <heartlesshealer> so it sees the damn controller
[1:42:09] <zenith0111> Did no one QA this?
[1:42:10] <%athuramn> that's because your steam is premapping your ps5 controller
[1:42:12] <+xerotwo> LUL
[1:42:14] <%BlackMage66652> THE GAME DENIES YOUR HOTZONE

[1:42:31] <laketoyaa> t u f f
[1:42:34] <%Axellogic> I was lied to
[1:42:34] <Frogwash> I think it's just the wrong controller profile, you have to activate them in steam big picture mode @PatStaresAt
[1:42:35] <%PigGuy800> I've found in the past with controller issues, selecting "force off" on steam input counterintuitively, let's the controller work with the game idk why
[1:42:36] <%RayCSmooth> check settings other tales games have had this issue
[1:42:37] <ak150> Wait I just came back. No No More Heroes today?
[1:42:37] <%NocturneNovember> TIME FOR REFUND
[1:42:37] <%hewlettfan96> Tales of arse

[1:42:40] <+kewlmyc> Okay, something is weird. I just tried with my Xbox One controller and I can control the menu just fine.
[1:42:40] <%BlackMage66652> Is this live on console yet or no?
[1:42:43] <%Dakuu75> @ape_hawk actualy the game is pooping it's pants

[1:42:47] <+ReallyBigRocks> just press the power button
[1:42:48] <+xerotwo> Time to bring that up on the podcast near October Kappa
[1:42:51] <heartlesshealer> if the controllers have zero inputs by default that would be insane
[1:42:51] <%alphonseisbest> this is why JP just played this on ps5

[1:44:58] <sodamin1> @ReallyBigRocks this is the best one
[1:44:59] <%AgniBrandt> I don't get it. I don't think any of the other Tales games on PC had this problem
[1:44:59] <%sandrews> I kind of don't want this game anymore
[1:44:59] <%BoxNavy> hello
[1:45:00] <%athuramn> I have earned your disappointment through honesty
[1:45:02] <KosOrSomeSayKosm_> you should try a guitar hero guitar just to be safe
[1:45:05] <+nicoleymcquack> it wants you to listen to the menu theme only, they worked really hard
[1:45:06] <+Vigonept> delete windows 64
[1:45:06] <BrickFight> Tales of Arise, the hot new game for the Microsoft Xbox Kinect
[1:45:08] <vicar_anat> ALL TALES GAMES BAD /s
[1:45:08] <%HotSauceFiend> Time to play a VR game maybe?

[1:45:23] <supergoblinpunch> Try the RE Chainsaw
[1:45:23] <%JoshManVGH> New hotness turned turd
[1:45:25] <%kknutson4> Maybe you have to play KB/M until you obtain the item that unlocks controller support :)
[1:45:28] <%alphonseisbest> try DS4 Maybe?
[1:45:31] <%BoxNavy> shhh
[1:45:33] <%RayCSmooth> the ps5 controller is the problem
[1:45:33] <%DianaTheAscian> @PatStaresAt so tomorrows stream is canceled I'm guessing?
[1:45:34] <heartlesshealer> Try your Playstation Move
[1:45:34] <rytisone> sometimes all you need is to restart the pc. Dont ask
[1:45:38] <$lotharrio> Tales is matching my expectations perfectly.

[1:45:51] <Coystick> I'm running out of obscure controllers to suggest
[1:45:53] <radregice> asmr
[1:45:53] <BrickFight> Money is on a dumb fix like turning off overlay or hitting alt+enter.
[1:45:56] <@TheYellowcouch> try a Wii U controller
[1:46:00] <%linSP> Steam heard you he’s coming
[1:46:01] <%hewlettfan96> Don’t wake steam
[1:46:01] <+Mrbaconator> CHAT BE QUIET
[1:46:01] <%AgniBrandt> Yeah, rebooting might do it; it's a weird and dumb enough problem
[1:46:03] <Tham1k> chat you are too loud
[1:46:03] <+nicoleymcquack> don’t wake dad

[1:46:15] <jorniev> why doesnt it have it
[1:46:19] <ELkasle> it feels like there should be option ingame to turn on controller

[1:46:31] <%cooldude69xx> So Mass Effect tomorrow?
[1:46:31] <%RayCSmooth> ps4 controller works
[1:46:32] <jorniev> do they just hate pc players--- probably
[1:46:33] <%HotSauceFiend> So controller support shenanigans aside, why not play keyboard?
[1:46:35] <KoryMccool> its out now

[1:46:48] <%KetsuoTaberu> Mass Effect psaDab
[1:46:49] <BrickFight> It's so weird because Japanese PC ports are usually "F the keyboard, use a controller."
[1:46:49] <%AgniBrandt> Did you preload it? Legit curious since I did and I'm having the issue. Reinstalling now to see what happens
[1:46:51] <@TheYellowcouch> yaaay mass effect
