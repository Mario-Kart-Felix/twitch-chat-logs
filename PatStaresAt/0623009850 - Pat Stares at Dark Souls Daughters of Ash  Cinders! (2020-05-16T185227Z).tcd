[0:10:58] <TheArrow_> so how is this different from what capcom did with sfv?
[0:10:59] <%baronblank> wow wtf
[0:11:00] <%angel949> Imma be real, I forgot Doom had a multi-player
[0:11:02] <%UvBenServed> Oh good
[0:11:04] <%Engwithan_Elder_God> That's not good.
[0:11:05] <+LynbellDaYo> the anti-cheat was added after the fact, doesn't matter what terms you accepted beforehand
[0:11:06] <CappuccinoGuil> Hot Take: Don't cheat. Also, don't break the rules in videogames.
[0:11:16] <$thesickestzak> Denuvo is the Vader of anti cheat
[0:11:16] <uncledoodsauce> @fat_burtreynolds no. I have it on PS4 and did not get any anti cheat shit.
[0:11:19] <Personified134> The stream has started, I am here, I am very excited. I will be back in an hour when the game actually begins.
[0:11:23] <ElenaManetta> why broke what aint fix

[0:11:34] <%spiritofmojave> Denuvo is equally ass with Nier Automata when I rebought it for PC, and MHW. People had to MOD it out because it was never patched to remove it

[0:11:45] <+Jasek7> thank you for clarifying, you sound less crazy
[0:11:46] <%AncelDeLambert> Surprise, a contract is only legal once a court says it's legal
[0:11:47] <Calek> if they're garbage and not legally binding why do they exist
[0:11:50] <+pandamancer224> what game?
[0:11:50] <%DappercatEsquire> Why add Denuvo like a month after release? I thought it was mostly to shore up the start from piracy.

[0:34:33] <%Meltdown547> Because they offered it, and Games Workshop said no, so fuck it.

[0:34:37] <%trustycoyote> Trolls are the best
[0:34:38] <%LaughingCatt> cause Games Workshop shot themselves in the foot
[0:34:42] <%corgispudmen> they work with Workshop
[0:34:45] <clempstwitch> They ripped of WoW and 40k. It was impressove
[0:34:46] <%MisterRockett> Starcraft was SUPPOSED to be a 40K game but for Warcraft I have no idea.
[0:34:46] <brian_peppers1> They didn't get away with it you mouthbreathers just don't care

[0:38:49] <%SharkMissile> # Big Mood
[0:38:50] <$gfkxj> Hey Pat what are you closing thoughts on RE 3make. When all said and done it feels really short and without speed based unlockables and the much more linear nature I though it was kind of hollow with not much reason to replay it.
[0:38:50] <AllenDeadman> damn
[0:38:50] <$correctedsun117> Damn
[0:38:51] <%logoth_> Thats not a thing
[0:38:52] <j0ustar> that's a bad one

[0:38:56] <+EyeFarted> Is this Anus London?
[0:39:01] <terribleusername> poke the cat with a keyboard
[0:39:01] <%NoHoldsBarredProductions> That sounds like the plot to a really bad sitcom
[0:39:03] <PanicSwytch> Pat is more of a Catacombs kinda guy
[0:39:05] <%optimasmaximas> play the original
[0:39:07] <bxdragon> Everyone is too stupid for college. We just have gotten good at bullshit and they love your loan money.

[0:39:12] <Coystick> The original is terrrrrible
[0:39:17] <Klefth> Better than dreaming that you jump off tall buildings head first on loop
[0:39:19] <SilverFaustX> remake is only 20% of the story
[0:39:20] <$WackyXmand> Is this the Krusty Krab?
[0:39:23] <%optimasmaximas> @Coystick leave

[0:39:30] <+Lunarhawk> And watch Advent Children
[0:39:32] <+GoodShotCam> watch an LP at the very least
[0:39:33] <iteruq> ending will fall flat
[0:39:35] <%angel949> I played it fresh and I regret it
[0:39:35] <zamzoph> PC mods!
[0:39:41] <%riantDeliration> and thats why i lost interest in buying it lol
[0:39:41] <+GenesisKnight> You lose quite a bit not knowing the original stuff
[0:39:41] <PanicSwytch> Wii?
[0:39:41] <%ScreamLord> Or watch an LP or Story video
[0:39:42] <%reinbachthe3rd> Playing it on Switch now actually.
[0:39:42] <%lutefiiisk> The ReMako PC version is the best
[0:39:43] <%logoth_> DONT WANT Advent CHILDREN
[0:39:44] <%cvp5127> get the pc one
[0:39:45] <T_Sasquatch> just watch a highlight reel lmao
[0:39:46] <%spacetitanium22> don't watch too often but love your content, especially on Twitter
[0:39:46] <OldManDeckardCain> You could just watch Pat's lp of FF7... oh wait Kappa
[0:39:48] <Jetsfantasy> and watch Advent Children, it's canon
[0:39:48] <%spiritofmojave> Switch is pretty easy to grab rn if you missed the original
[0:39:50] <prophetdisharmonious> Advent Children is a MUST Kappa
[0:39:52] <%madskull456> fine
[0:39:54] <%maenos2> cultural osmosis got me most the knowledge I needed.
[0:39:56] <%Nekros4442> Also watch Advent Children
[0:39:57] <Coystick> @optimasmaximas this post was sponsored by the FFVIII gang
[0:39:57] <CherrieVelvet> who's that cat?
[0:40:00] <%dekkitout> See what happens when you assume, ya get an ass of u and me
[0:40:00] <%YakumoYomi> 10 seconds of "cat" outta nowhere!
[0:40:02] <%optimasmaximas> cait sith LUL
[0:40:02] <zamzoph> yes, don't forget to watch Advent Children Kappa
[0:40:05] <%Aydarkzero> while playing the original is recommend you can still enjoy the game as a weird mystery
[0:40:05] <%tank7013> FF7 remake also has MASSIVE FUCKING SPOILERS just in it
[0:40:06] <SirRadical> RETCONS evertwhere
[0:40:08] <JetpackMcQuack> It’s 20 hrs though, keep that in mind
[0:40:10] <$shadow1man9> Advent Children actually a must-watch LUL
[0:40:10] <%Comradeiota> It's ridiculous
[0:40:11] <%TheFramedWarlock> You should play FF7 original because the devs are con artists
[0:40:11] <iteruq> watch advent children
[0:40:11] <j0ustar> The android/ios version gives you cheats if you really don't want to do any kind of grind
[0:40:12] <%heartlesshealer> Watch Advent Children or Crisis Core after your go of the original FF7
[0:40:12] <%spiritofmojave> Cat pounding the floor LUL
[0:40:14] <terribleusername> don't pretend you don't know
[0:40:14] <%Valdorick> Aw man, its SHOP OWNER FROM THAT ONE TOWN
[0:40:15] <TwinBat> it's a sequel
[0:40:15] <%Binary_Fireball> I am palying FF7R first and am getting those vibes
[0:40:17] <AllenDeadman> Me? Gongaga!
[0:40:18] <%Comradeiota> How much of a lie it was that you can play it without playing OG
[0:40:18] <%RNGbob> that sounds.... really bad
[0:40:25] <shadowboss89> It's Cloud from Kingdom Hearts

[0:40:53] <%heartlesshealer> Oh right, Dirge of Cerberus also has some stuff that gets caught in the Remake
[0:40:55] <%Diana869> Pat that doesn't sound like i should play ff7r first at all
[0:40:57] <%comfyman12> HEX is crazy fun

[0:41:06] <%AnAsianToaster> first run through ds2 was hexing, fun as fuck
[0:41:08] <CheckMyDubsSkrub> It would be a real change to see a streamer do a magic run right from the bat
[0:41:08] <$WackyXmand> @shadowboss89 I am a fan of both KH and FF7 and that hurt me

[0:41:21] <%StrifeZubia> @Comradeiota I mean it isn't like, a lie. You could play it. But there's a looot of plot stuff that just really expects you to KNOW FF7
[0:41:26] <$gfkxj> Magic just does not feel good to use in D1 or D3

[0:42:19] <+BallinArbiter> I'm sure that the only me is me. Are you sure that the only you is you?
[0:42:19] <andrei11dr> But wat if they replace you though?
[0:42:19] <$Piemono> Or they could make virus just for you
[0:42:20] <%xcompleasedad> It's more about Insurance and hiring prejudice
[0:42:20] <shadowboss89> @wackyxmand same with Aqua's boyfriend
[0:42:22] <%rumtumtugnutz> FF7R would be more playab;e as a first foray into FF7 if it had a little bit more to it than just Midgard. But there's stuff they set up for later that they don't pay off that you're only going to understand if you're at least tangentally familiar with the original
[0:42:23] <%Emperor_MurKruM> WESTWORLD 3 IS THE WORST
[0:42:23] <%starotter70> Yeah, blood, I meant blood
[0:42:26] <TikanZK> Dont they send the DNA to insurance companies and then the companies find out if you're more likely to have health issues and then they boost the rates?
[0:42:26] <+ghostfaceninja_> do identical twins have identity crises? for the most part no....
[0:42:26] <Shishi1205> they retain your Genetic data so they can sell that info to Insurers @PatStaresAt
[0:42:27] <Valentinius_Anodyne> Why is that a big deal anyhow? It's undoubtably on record anyhow
[0:42:29] <%reinbachthe3rd> People be dumb as hell.
[0:42:29] <$WackyXmand> unless it's a Fifth Day situation
[0:42:30] <OldManDeckardCain> there are already catboy/girl clone versions of all of us in some russian laboratory
[0:42:30] <+Frankyzappa> My DNA is everywhere, anyway
[0:42:32] <%heartlesshealer> fucking barber hair
[0:42:32] <cache_22> It's not crimes, but more health insurance companies in the US want that data to deny coverage.
[0:42:34] <ElenaManetta> thats the crime of the century
[0:42:36] <sendart> just go on grindr
[0:42:36] <%NecDW4> Do a DNA test @PatStaresAt get an army of clones to play FF14 with you, never worry about bad parties again!!!
[0:42:36] <deity_majora> It is also it give the GOV free access to DNA without warrant... it is a US thing
[0:42:37] <%doc_ock_rokc> @PatStaresAt its more that will sell your dna information to government without your premission
[0:42:38] <Coystick> Yeah my DNA is everywhere
[0:42:40] <%viewtifulr> reach up into them for some DNA
[0:42:43] <teohoho> but WHAT IF THEY WANT MY DNA?
[0:42:45] <%angel949> DNA all over my floor
[0:42:45] <BallerSwagBro9k> Once your clone is born he becomes someone else because he begins to exprience different things than you
[0:42:46] <%dirtyh4rr1> Lots of DNA on the socks
[0:42:52] <%Valdorick> DS2 1.0, Defenders Great Sword Kreygasm, Sunlight Spear Kreygasm, 82 Great Lightning Spears Kreygasm
[0:42:54] <CheckMyDubsSkrub> @ElenaManetta Don't do those ancestry tests because you'll find out your the product of adultery and you'll ruin your family's happiness
[0:42:55] <%YakumoYomi> @Zombrocom I disagree. I feel that Soul Sacrifice has better magic...but it's not really a fair comparison, because EVERYTHING the player uses is essentially "magic".
[0:42:57] <vonmaultke> I would love a clone of me, we would have a good time

[0:43:35] <+hax_metatron> All I ever wanted was to be able to do viable magic runs in later From games, before they got obsessed with “balancing” classes. Cinders dark pyro run came closest to doing magic runs in DeS or DS1! From should do difficulty but let you break their games again ... they’ve been moving away from that.

[0:43:50] <%dekkitout> How so?
[0:43:51] <ittla> the scary thing is that with collection and sale of data, the idea is ancestry sites also just straight up put your DNA and lineage in there too

[0:44:22] <mistermastergreg> @PatStaresAt I saw ENB play Bloodborne with his left hand

[0:44:48] <Coystick> I don't think Pat has played Bloodborne before

[0:58:39] <+FroggoPrince> I would definitely love to see a Dark Souls randomizer
[0:58:42] <$dalmek> this mod seems like it's very anti-memory
[0:58:43] <+DesertPenguin> Read item descriptions for changes
[0:58:45] <Vaardvark> it wouldn't be a pat souls playthrough if he didn't do a bunch of stuff off stream
[0:58:47] <%AnAsianToaster> now fight the other demon
[0:58:47] <+AlphaBankai> check more descriptions Pat, you got a diffeent Soul item
[0:58:50] <ElenaManetta> so is there a rhyme or reason to some of the changes, like, difficulty wise
[0:58:52] <%XzileGaming> kill Stray you coward
[0:58:53] <beefomkers> @patstaresat My favorite thing about you is that when your stream starts I have like 30 minutes to finish what I'm doing before I actually have to start watching your stream
[0:58:54] <ElenaManetta> or is it just meant to throw you off your game
[0:58:57] <%thegreenbenis> Check descriptions

[1:00:55] <Shishi1205> It seems
[1:00:55] <$dalmek> feels like a different font

[1:01:02] <%JamesCorck> Pat, when did you last played this game?
[1:01:03] <%Quigsies> It's different for remastered I think
[1:01:03] <+RandomMishaps> The font looks much better
[1:01:03] <Jontman42> I DON'T KNOW COULDN'T HEAR HIM

[1:01:11] <IminyourBase> they got the voice actor to record new lines LUL

[1:01:12] <fat_burtreynolds> Try Tongue But Hole Squid4 Squid4 Squid4 Squid4 Squid4

[1:01:16] <Coystick> Yeah there used to be more n words in there
[1:01:16] <+BallinArbiter> hehehe
[1:01:19] <ElenaManetta> The font is also way more spaced out
[1:01:22] <Shishi1205> Maybe cut dialogue
[1:01:24] <%Daniel_Is_I> Not humanity. Fuck your early game farming.
[1:01:25] <+ConLin_Arts_> aw I wanted some bad VA work
[1:01:25] <$thesickestzak> Don't gaslight Pat. He hasn't moved.
[1:01:29] <khotgor> prism stones best item in the game
[1:01:29] <+Soulsbjorne> Unless it was cut dialogue they modded back in
[1:01:29] <CappuccinoGuil> I thought they removed the bonfire in this mod?
[1:01:30] <+hax_metatron> That’s just remastered font. None of the dialogue has changed
[1:01:32] <+RandomMishaps> I hope haircut just isn't there anymore

[1:18:17] <beefomkers> Crazy Talk Requiem is just gaslighting though
[1:18:17] <khotgor> all humanity locations changed

[1:36:01] <+Sebenoth> Does this suffer from the same issue as other modded games, being created by ppl that have mastered the game to an absurd degree?
[1:36:01] <khotgor> rat parrying
[1:36:02] <%Order_of_Mystery> parry dagger got more frames, tho
[1:36:02] <%fetrigon> Has Dark Souls always looked like this?
[1:36:03] <Coystick> uhhhhhh

[1:36:21] <BallerSwagBro9k> @Shishi1205 WERE TOO OP NOONE CAN [ARRY US
[1:36:21] <Shishi1205> That's why its the parrying dagger

[1:36:22] <+jjhoho> well yeah i haven't played it
[1:36:24] <%Aydarkzero> Souls Characters so strong they parry weapons w/ their arms LUL

[1:36:46] <Shishi1205> Easy mode achieved
[1:36:46] <KaiserMario> Remember when the church was more interested in hunting heathens rather than mosters? Then Leon Belmont had to give up his sword to save his girl

[2:09:22] <Calek> that's dumb
[2:09:22] <mostundesired> PUTTING ON A HEAVY THING DOESN'T MAKE IT LESS HEAVY
[2:09:22] <%nmaten> thats really dumb
[2:09:23] <ハクア> that's stupid and makes no sense
[2:09:23] <+AntithesisEK> excessive
[2:09:23] <%Laecerelius> That's super dumb
[2:09:23] <Whiskey_T_Foxtrot> That's half-baked. I like the idea, but not the implementation.
[2:09:24] <+DesertPenguin> Couldn't they just make it a STR requirement instead?
[2:09:24] <%ladomania> that's dumb tho
[2:09:24] <nutimik> was the gargoyle thing changed then? because I played the mod some months ago and that wasn't in there afaik
[2:09:24] <%baronblank> wtf
[2:09:24] <+lethallylactic> Makes sense :)
[2:09:25] <%GohanHitsugaya> Because heavy
[2:09:26] <chhdez> break what
[2:09:27] <srkAres> do they know how bells work?
[2:09:27] <%AncelDeLambert> you pull a LEVER
[2:09:27] <jhonxiolonn> it makes sense
[2:09:28] <%Hegelundra> @PatStaresAt heavy gloves also increase your damage if that wasnt patched out
[2:09:28] <+oda_flobunaga> for the LULZ why else
[2:09:28] <+Standard_Enemy> Big hulk hands make you stronger
[2:09:29] <%GohanHitsugaya> LUL
[2:09:30] <%ALazo> I don't understand the connection between those two things
[2:09:30] <Coystick> That's not how physics works though
[2:09:30] <+Kataiser> Limits sequence breaking for speedrun competitiveness.
[2:09:30] <+gutlesscoward> can't you just use a suitably blunt weapon?
[2:09:30] <Mehless> IT WORKS
[2:09:30] <Blank9> if you can lift your hands in those gloves, you could ring the bell
[2:09:31] <%doc_ock_rokc> @cowardlord Stupidly awesome!
[2:09:31] <%trustycoyote> Dont you pull a level to ring the bells tho?
[2:09:33] <%Th3SmartAlec> LUL
[2:09:36] <CrypticMochi> Is stuff like those gloves why it’s obtuse?
[2:09:37] <+toficque> i mean i guess

[2:09:38] <Shishi1205> LUL
[2:09:38] <%trustycoyote> lever*
[2:09:38] <TallGuyWithAHoodie> BUT WHY THOUGH
[2:09:38] <khotgor> also heavy gloves do not make you stronger
[2:09:38] <mostundesired> Yeah, so? Kappa
[2:09:39] <Mister_McDerp> but thats stupid
[2:09:39] <%optimasmaximas> LUL
[2:09:39] <%BigLoserJosh> that's also stupid!
[2:09:41] <%comfyman12> But wouldn't having heavy gloves make it harder to ring a heavy bell
[2:09:41] <%nmaten> but thats cool stupid
[2:09:42] <$LuchaDePucha> well thats just fun lol
[2:09:42] <%tank7013> Putting on heavy gloves... makes it easier to pull a lever?
[2:09:43] <Greedboyz> That's dumb
[2:09:43] <%AncelDeLambert> no but that's COOL
[2:09:43] <@SSaryn> Chat is stupid I say 3
[2:09:43] <TwinBat> THAT'S DUMB COOL THO
[2:09:43] <Luneth_Aerohawk> But that's stupid too!
[2:09:43] <+YabbaTroll> that was rad tho
[2:09:43] <+Reaverund> Why do heavy gloves make it easier to move something heavy
[2:09:44] <AnacondaVirtue> That was ALSO stupid, Pat
[2:09:44] <%bevyrage> a 20lb gauntlet set is needed, versus the 150lb hollow that holds them
[2:09:44] <+MrBaldachin> that's not the same thing at all
[2:09:45] <Calek> point and click adventure game logic is never good
[2:09:45] <CappuccinoGuil> THIS MOD IS THE BEST
[2:09:45] <Coystick> That's old though, Pat
[2:09:46] <%cowardlord> That is also stupid
[2:09:46] <+lordericter> ok let me rephrase, this mod is stupid
[2:09:46] <+twohitgood> it's a video game being video game-y
[2:09:47] <jhonxiolonn> but that's STUPID and awesome
[2:09:48] <+gutlesscoward> hey man, stand users are attracted to stand users, that's just how iti s
[2:09:48] <danielm427> stands are not stupid
[2:09:48] <zaitje> Priorities Pat
[2:09:49] <%consistentlylistless> Can't lift heavy weights without my gauntlets on
[2:09:49] <ECRead> THAT is cool tho
[2:09:49] <%Laecerelius> But stand bosses are cool
[2:09:49] <%spiritofmojave> well.. stands are cool
[2:09:51] <+crazyspartan214> it cool stupid
[2:09:51] <%HouseofNonsense> 3
[2:09:51] <+moink1234> that was also stupid
[2:09:51] <+DesertPenguin> But the physics of it make no sense. It makes more sense to need more strength
[2:09:51] <DavidDredd84> That's literally why I couldn't finish the mod
[2:09:52] <Jrocy247> THAT'S MORE BELIEVABLE
[2:09:52] <+gutlesscoward> just how it is*
[2:09:52] <%velemi> that's cool stupid though not dumb stupid
[2:09:52] <worldbrand> Yeah but that's stupid and fun
[2:09:53] <%GohanHitsugaya> Manny things can be stupid Pat
[2:09:54] <ハクア> to be fair titanite demons are harder to kill than 80% of this game's bosses
[2:09:54] <@SSaryn> psa3guy
[2:09:54] <%Mornaka> 3
[2:09:54] <%Eldith> BECAUSE RINGING THE BELL WITH NORMAL HANDS WILL TURN THEM TO JELLO DER

[2:09:54] <CappuccinoGuil> CHAT YOU'RE DUMB, THAT WAS SICK
[2:09:55] <@BigNaturalMan59> this is a weird endless space 2 mod
[2:09:55] <%dekkitout> It's stupid cool tho
[2:09:56] <+chidorah101> heavy gloves also add ar to your weapon
[2:09:58] <+Standard_Enemy> Fight the demon stand with stone hulk hands!
[2:09:58] <Equirah> that doesn't make sense, heavy gloves decreases movement LUL
[2:09:59] <+superkeaton> If the gauntlets were a stand we'd accept it
[2:10:00] <Phob05> I remember the scene in hunchback where Quasimodo had to put on hulk hands to ring the bells
[2:10:01] <+oda_flobunaga> Dark Souls has never been "smart" tbh
[2:10:01] <%Zombrocom> Wearing heavy gloves would not make it easy to ring a bell
[2:10:02] <%UvBenServed> It would make more sense to have a strength check. More annoying, but still
[2:10:02] <%GohanHitsugaya> Lol manny
[2:10:04] <prophetdisharmonious> Rule of cool Pat.
[2:10:05] <+EmiinV> i mean taurus demons are technically regular enemies too, and you just fought one of those as a boss
[2:10:05] <%Veldime> basically everything in this mod is stupid
[2:10:10] <jhonxiolonn> use a humanity
[2:10:12] <%reinbachthe3rd> Stand battles are more believable than needing heavy gloves to ring a damn bell.
[2:10:13] <Shishi1205> yes
[2:10:13] <%silverira> but the first titanite demon is a mini boss he just got promoted
[2:10:16] <+LionheartMD> added protection on your hands so the wire doesn't cut them up, obviously
[2:10:19] <Cactuskris> ok boys what did I miss OSW review is over
[2:10:19] <+superkeaton> It is a very "Souls" progression blocker
[2:10:19] <%tank7013> What do you fucking punch the bells now?

[2:18:52] <Personified134> and I can't update without fucking my save
[2:19:13] <whitewhiskeygamer> Can't you just back up your save?
[2:19:18] <%TheHeroAppears> play the game faster
[2:19:33] <TheArrow_> does it auto update or something?
[2:19:47] <%Piemen99> cool
[2:19:50] <khotgor> I realized why they were giving titanite shards so early
[2:19:57] <Personified134> no, the problem is I keep making builds on versions of the game they suck on, only for it to be immediately buffed on an update I can't use becuase it'll fuck my save
[2:19:59] <khotgor> They wanted you to upgrade at the new londo blacksmith
[2:20:15] <$Dakuu75> wow, I afk'd and came back before Pat? My orb must be faster than his.

[2:54:40] <+lethallylactic> Those are cosmetic Pat
[2:54:41] <$valkuma> this looks way beter than the DS1 mod. the DS1 mod makes you backtrack through every zone basically constantly and never lets you warp.

[3:24:52] <+lethallylactic> @PatStaresAt This accessory used to add a %chance to recover basic arrows from slain enemies, but it seriously bugged the game out LUL

[3:25:12] <Lophostrix_> @galaxyswirl nope, you have to play offline or you get VAC-banned
[3:25:13] <%Order_of_Mystery> speaking of sniping, I believe you can carry a LOT more arrows now, so ranged bow builds are viable!
[3:25:13] <%Ninestempest> mod page says to use code "cinder" to match with other people with the mod
[3:25:14] <aeonicvector> @galaxyswirl kinda, you can enable it, but your going to end up in the "banned" servers
[3:25:19] <+hax_metatron> Check out YouTube Cinders multiplayer

[3:25:55] <AzureFlame98> Like some gloves can even give you on hit effects or elemental damage.
[3:25:57] <+MetroidHunter26> But what about my fashion! BibleThump
[3:25:57] <+superkeaton> I wonder rooVV

[3:26:04] <%starotter70> Oh dear
[3:26:04] <Jontman42> I have a feeling
[3:26:04] <SpaghettiAnchorite> Chat, what is this mod called? Dark Souls 3 Cinders?
[3:26:07] <aeonicvector> @ralphfromdk you CAN online, but it disables it by default, because youll end up in the banned server
[3:26:08] <NiftyNox> Already these low cost good bread and butter spells are so good
[3:26:11] <aeonicvector> which STILL works
[3:26:11] <lilredmage> :O
[3:26:12] <Calek> @SpaghettiAnchorite that's correct

[3:26:44] <jhonxiolonn> use Solair
[3:26:44] <%kapcommunist> these cairns are for you
[3:26:46] <Fujiwara_92> why not
[3:26:47] <%dirtyh4rr1> This mod is something
[3:26:49] <$Sphincter_Spelunker> wait, that's illegal
[3:26:55] <koolkatdq> What
[3:26:57] <BallerSwagBro9k> BRUH
[3:26:59] <skyentombment> IF YOU HAVE THE POSE, I GUESS YOU CAN BE HERE
[3:27:02] <%Keyd00d> Warp to the final boss
[3:27:03] <+lethallylactic> Death to linearity!
[3:27:04] <%AnAsianToaster> this mod is insane and so much fun
[3:27:13] <%Order_of_Mystery> Oh yeah, and both the ancient dragon and Yhorm can be fought and beaten without their respective gimmicks. You can still drop-attack the dragon, tho
[3:27:14] <%dasmause> @PatStaresAt does this mod let you skip irithyl dungeon?
[3:27:17] <%comfyman12> Can you completely avoid the swamp because fuck that area
[3:27:19] <%heartlesshealer> 👏👏👏
[3:27:19] <Jontman42> rip souls
[3:27:21] <Calek> still an end game area
[3:27:24] <drewslo> overall damage taken seems lower
[3:27:29] <jhonxiolonn> Pat, your souls
[3:27:30] <OperatorPlease> oh thank god
[3:27:31] <%optimasmaximas> PogChamp
[3:27:32] <Jontman42> FUCKING YES
[3:27:34] <HowlingSamurai> BRUH
[3:27:35] <+Sinetha> YESSS
[3:27:36] <%spiritofmojave> YAAAAAS
[3:27:37] <%Ninestempest> THANK GOD
[3:27:39] <sperium3000> Oh man real Yorm, sounds scary
[3:27:40] <RrenKrieg> @comfyman12 *spoilers* the swamp doesn't slow you down anymore
[3:27:46] <BallerSwagBro9k> GENIUS KOJUMBO
[3:27:50] <%Diana869> YES
[3:27:50] <+Sebenoth> Just do a BB dlc run for all the items while screaming deal
[3:27:50] <%baronblank> hell yea
[3:27:50] <+hax_metatron> Look, REAL POISE
[3:27:52] <+lethallylactic> And dogs still suck LUL
[3:27:53] <%Order_of_Mystery> @sperium3000 Dude, he is. Big scary
[3:27:54] <NiftyNox> Pupsnuffer Pete
[3:27:55] <zocano> Yhorm was actually always designed to be fought normally, it was a late in dev change to make him "gimmicky"
[3:27:55] <Zombrocom> Yhorm was always a real boss fight, he was actually fun to fight without storm ruler
[3:27:55] <Jontman42> but no seriously where's the bad parts of the mod
[3:27:57] <DSD24> So this is a mod?
[3:28:01] <shin_marx> LA DIFICULDAD
[3:28:02] <Jrocy247> YHORM CHANGE WAS NEEDED
[3:28:03] <+superkeaton> @Order_of_Mystery The first time I fought the Ancient Wyvern I did it on foot because I was so bad at the gauntlet. LUL I genuinely found it easier to bait out his fire breath then attack his head
[3:28:10] <beezushrist> Wait, what happened to Dark Souls 1 LOL???
[3:28:10] <Fujiwara_92> not a mod Kappa
[3:28:11] <KosOrSomeSayKosm_> bonk
[3:28:12] <%Order_of_Mystery> mhmm
[3:28:13] <$Sphincter_Spelunker> stick go bonk
[3:28:16] <ape_hawk> its a sharp stick, of course it would
[3:28:16] <sperium3000> I mean you ARE hitting motherfuckers with sticks
[3:28:17] <jhonxiolonn> that sword looks longer than it is
[3:28:17] <HellishLancer> THWACK
[3:28:18] <TheAlienatorJM> looks cool
[3:28:19] <WizardofWazz> beating stick
[3:28:20] <%BLK_HRLQN_13> staves?
[3:28:21] <+Sinetha> FOR REAL?
[3:28:22] <Ner234> bonk
[3:28:25] <+LTKonnor> STICK GOES THWACK
[3:28:25] <%Shadicara> This is just dark souls 4 guys Kappa
[3:28:26] <Jontman42> explain to me why this isn't just Dark Souls 3 but better
[3:28:27] <drewslo> they were kind of like that in ds2
[3:28:27] <+lethallylactic> All the staves also have dedicated weapon equivalents.
[3:28:28] <ChatNinja> If you can beat someone with a club you should with a stick
[3:28:30] <Combat_Data> seems all the stuff that's actually interesting about the mod are not listed on the changes for the mod
[3:28:31] <SpaghettiAnchorite> Give um' the ol' gamer dent
[3:28:31] <%Keyd00d> donk
[3:28:31] <%SaphronBlackbourne> DS1 stopped cuz that mod sucks
[3:28:33] <+lethallylactic> With movesets
[3:28:35] <NiftyNox> Kinda like dark 2 staves
[3:28:36] <THELava_lad> Isn't some of the boss themes replaced with Alex roe remakes
[3:28:37] <+QuasartheHero> @
[3:28:38] <Calek> a solid 20 percent is still good
[3:28:39] <%Order_of_Mystery> oh, and there are quarterstaffs in the game, and their weapon arts are AWESOME!
[3:28:40] <lilredmage> AS HE DUSTS A KNIGHT
[3:28:40] <Equirah> better than the pew pew spell LUL
[3:28:40] <TheAlienatorJM> loool
[3:28:43] <aeonicvector> make sure to let everyone know you CAN online with it, but your steam account will be server banned on ds3 (ergo "hacker" servers only)
[3:28:43] <Dragovus> Get out there and twat him with sticks you wankers
[3:28:45] <ape_hawk> Dark Souls 3.33: You Can (Not) Cinder
[3:28:45] <j0ustar> I will hit you my TITANIUM wooden stick of magic
[3:28:46] <TheAlienatorJM> not very good
[3:28:47] <RrenKrieg> @Combat_Data the changelogs are much more detailed
[3:28:47] <beezushrist> @SaphronBlackbourne thanks
[3:28:48] <jhonxiolonn> just hit him with the sword without stopping
[3:28:48] <sperium3000> You can actually be sword and staff Gandalf now
[3:29:00] <%Keyd00d> woah
[3:29:02] <NiftyNox> holy hell
[3:29:04] <%heartlesshealer> oh right, for arrows
[3:29:07] <%Ninestempest> holy SHIt
[3:29:09] <%GalacticLatte> It's even longer than that
[3:29:11] <%Order_of_Mystery> But pat, does that mean spells go further too?
[3:29:12] <+lethallylactic> Archer builds Kreygasm
[3:29:13] <%Keyd00d> thank fuck
[3:29:13] <RrenKrieg> archer builds are now better
[3:29:14] <federleicht> archer build reliable?
[3:29:14] <Darkfire346> so this mod also makes the game harder in general? cause I found DS3 to be pretty easy with a few exceptions like Nameless King
[3:29:14] <jhonxiolonn> THat's SO NICE
[3:29:15] <ralphfromdk> That is kinda disgusting :D
[3:29:15] <Valentinius_Anodyne> It's pretty nice
[3:29:17] <%Taisuru> @Combat_Data That's why it says to look at the changelogs dummy
[3:29:18] <+hax_metatron> Real magic, not limited by any rules as it should be
[3:29:18] <aeonicvector> ring
[3:29:21] <%Order_of_Mystery> Why yes, it does!
[3:29:21] <%GalacticLatte> you can snipe the swamp crabs from nearly the entire map
[3:29:23] <%dirtyh4rr1> Busted
[3:29:24] <THELava_lad> LUL
[3:29:24] <+dark_kebabs> am I high or is that dark edge really fast?
[3:29:25] <skyentombment> fucking finally it makes sense to be a sorcerer
[3:29:25] <%Order_of_Mystery> Look at that shit
[3:29:26] <Ner234> sniped
[3:29:28] <$Sphincter_Spelunker> now you too can be legol lass
[3:29:29] <DestroPrime83> what is going on Mod or Update?
[3:29:29] <sperium3000> I AM SO SAD I CAN'T PUT MODS IN MY PS4
[3:29:31] <+RD_nx> maybe I can finally try a greatbow build :)
[3:29:33] <+QuasartheHero> @patstaresat are there twin blades in this mod?
[3:29:38] <+TopTieramisu> isn't magic op like this?
[3:29:40] <skyentombment> I CAN HAVE MY LEGGY MOMENT NOW?
[3:29:42] <%gatoralus> !uptime
[3:29:43] <@Moobot> I've been playing this game for how long? Oh only 3h 29m.
[3:29:46] <+ConLin_Arts_> so no fanfic?
[3:29:47] <+Sapientiae> @aeonicvector yep so you use a dummy account that is family shared with your main account so that one gets the ban
[3:29:51] <%Order_of_Mystery> @skyentombment casters in general, save for pyromancies which are still mostly lobbed
[3:30:07] <aeonicvector> @Sapientiae Not anymore, bamco stopped family share
[3:30:09] <+lethallylactic> Also Ciaran's blades from DS1 as a paired weapon.
[3:30:09] <+hax_metatron> Nah it's like whatever here's thing go crazy
[3:30:09] <Fujiwara_92> no fanfic Kreygasm
[3:30:09] <+QuasartheHero> Like d2 /darth maul twin blades?
[3:30:09] <heymannicesh0t> Swatting all them flies
[3:30:11] <KosOrSomeSayKosm_> so wait but only bloodborne weapons are in, not armor right?
[3:30:12] <andiianfii> it does make up some lore stuff to try and fit the ds2 and bloodborne weapons into the game
[3:30:14] <Zombrocom> If you meant twinblade as in a double sided sword, there is one yes
[3:30:15] <skyentombment> awwww man, that sucks
[3:30:15] <%Keyd00d> DS3 is 85% off on greenman right now btw
[3:30:16] <zocano> Fully leaning into Dark Souls 3's rule of cool trumping any lore reasoning
[3:30:17] <%The_Butterfly_Man> is the chikage in the game?
[3:30:18] <sperium3000> So no Young Iron King boss fight?
[3:30:23] <+hax_metatron> @KosOrSomeSayKosm_ Armor too
[3:30:25] <someyounguy1> damn. this mod is called daughters of ash and cinder right? i want to make sure i dont get the wrong mod
[3:30:27] <spoiledbadger> healing is more expensive and stops fp regen for several seconds after use
[3:30:28] <ChatNinja> Is Blue Flame in this? And is it dual-wielded?
[3:30:32] <LunarRemix> This mod seems to solve the problem that all DS3 builds kind of feel the same. Neat.
[3:30:34] <+Sapientiae> @aeonicvector when because I was using up to a month ago
[3:30:34] <%Keyd00d> @someyounguy1 this one is just Cinders
[3:30:38] <prophetdisharmonious> Blades of Mercy is the shiiiiiiit
[3:30:40] <Valentinius_Anodyne> @someyounguy1 This one is just the Cinders mod
[3:30:41] <%Taisuru> Covenant item as well
[3:30:42] <aeonicvector> 5/6/2020
[3:30:44] <KosOrSomeSayKosm_> @hax_metatron PogChamp PogChamp PogChamp
[3:30:46] <aeonicvector> @Sapientiae
[3:30:47] <%Ninestempest> Daughters of Ash is a DS1 mod
[3:30:47] <@SoFarFetched> @someyounguy1 Daughters of ASh is for DS1, Cinders is for DS3
[3:30:50] <sperium3000> @someyounguy1 This one is Cinders, and the one for DS1 is Daughters of Ash
[3:30:51] <+hax_metatron> @KosOrSomeSayKosm_ Not all
[3:30:55] <Zombrocom> @someyounguy1 This is the Cinders mod for DS3. Daughters of ash is for Dark souls 1

[3:31:36] <%Mornaka> @Skeletonmanners he knows
[3:31:36] <%Capta1n_H3nry> HE JUST SAID IT
[3:31:36] <%Taisuru> The alternate attacks idiots
[3:31:36] <mostundesired> The different attacks, guys.
[3:31:38] <+lethallylactic> The spell has different moves if you roll
[3:31:42] <%heartlesshealer> Reveal secrets to us, Orb GivePLZ
[3:31:43] <Jontman42> it is their fault
[3:31:45] <Dragovus> WHO SAID THAT?
[3:31:45] <jbees7> !cinders
[3:31:47] <+superkeaton> We learned it from watching you! rooCry
[3:31:47] <%starotter70> sipsipSipsipblind HEY psaBlind
[3:31:49] <%Order_of_Mystery> Roll/backstep attacks with spells
[3:31:50] <%Keyd00d> some people aren't watching the whole time
[3:31:53] <%optimasmaximas> yeah you and paige rub off on us
[3:31:53] <Valentinius_Anodyne> Look man, I got glasses I can't help it
[3:31:54] <$Sphincter_Spelunker> or their alt tabbed but sure be snarky
[3:31:56] <%Piemen99> I WAS READING
[3:31:56] <Fujiwara_92> mentioned what Kappa
[3:31:56] <%FacetiousAF> psa1guy psaBlind
[3:31:56] <spoiledbadger> a lot more
[3:32:02] <%spiritofmojave> We learn blindness from you guys LUL
[3:32:02] <%Taisuru> @Keyd00d Then why are they typing
[3:32:03] <Calek> durability is also a thing that you have to look out for, but it's nowhere near DS2 level
[3:32:04] <jbees7> Cinders!
[3:32:05] <%rickyjones47> What rooster teeth video was Pat in recently?
[3:32:07] <OperatorPlease> so wait, does this mod have PVP?
[3:32:10] <Jontman42> like 500 hours of more replay value
[3:32:12] <sperium3000> Man that spell is useful as fuck
[3:32:14] <+RD_nx> FP in this game should recharge, I prefer it much more than the vancian-like system
[3:32:15] <$Sphincter_Spelunker> @rickyjones47 smash stream yesterday
[3:32:16] <%VashyronM> Does magic recharge naturally or is it from an item?
[3:32:17] <%FacetiousAF> @rickyjones47 he did a smash bros thing yesterday
[3:32:18] <+hax_metatron> Honestly it really pissed me off that the Daughters of Ash guy said he was "fixing Dark Souls 1"
[3:32:18] <jhonxiolonn> wait till you see the gundyrs stuff
[3:32:19] <AliceAstro> pat is a scumbag
[3:32:20] <%Keyd00d> @Taisuru they heard but didn't see and are wondering why
[3:32:21] <+QuadraticGravity> @OperatorPlease yeah but you have to get yourself softbanned to do it
[3:32:22] <+lethallylactic> @OperatorPlease Not unless you want to get banned.
[3:32:23] <andiianfii> @rickyjones47 he and woolie were on a stream
[3:32:25] <Lophostrix_> @OperatorPlease can't play online
[3:32:26] <%heartlesshealer> Pat was in a Clemps video recently, didn't know about smash
[3:32:29] <Darkfire346> WHAT
[3:32:32] <olwatshisface> @PatStaresAt you can hold almost all spells like heal
[3:32:34] <%Taisuru> @Keyd00d This is how ONE GUY happens
[3:32:35] <lilredmage> GUH
[3:32:37] <%VashyronM> Nice
[3:32:38] <Robot_Nixon_> theres also a successful enemy randomizer now too
[3:32:38] <OperatorPlease> how wonderfully depressing
[3:32:39] <muetank> Can you play the DLCs with this mod?
[3:32:39] <%rickyjones47> Thanks guys
[3:32:39] <%Piemen99> OOOO
[3:32:40] <sperium3000> @AliceAstro Wha happun?
[3:32:42] <%Keyd00d> ???
[3:32:42] <+Sapientiae> is it still based off equip load?
[3:32:45] <aeonicvector> All online functionality works, but its turned off by default, because youll go to CheaterJail Servers
[3:32:45] <Zombrocom> So what determines how fast your MP recharges? Attunement?
[3:32:47] <Valentinius_Anodyne> @muetank Yes
[3:32:48] <+hax_metatron> @muetank Yes all integrated
[3:32:48] <%Order_of_Mystery> Oh and by the way Chat, this mod is FREQUENTLY updated. For reference, I played this a few months ago, and a tone of stuff that Pat here is showing off weren't in there when I played! The dev of this mod is very active in their community!
[3:32:50] <Calek> @muetank you sure can

[3:38:58] <%Keyd00d> When's Elden Ring
[3:39:01] <Zombrocom> I don't think elden ring will be a souls
[3:39:01] <%Order_of_Mystery> If elden ring comes to PC, tho
[3:39:01] <%XeroSigmaPrime> You're worried this is too good?
[3:39:03] <+QuadraticGravity> I think there's an Elden Ring joke in this mod
[3:39:07] <beezushrist> I do not worry about modders outdoing FROM @PatStaresAt
[3:39:08] <sperium3000> Considering it's been more than a year and we have seen DICK of Elden Ring, I am worried
[3:39:11] <+hax_metatron> @PatStaresAt There's a DS2 mod that literally adds LEVELS and changes geography, the future is near
[3:39:14] <spoiledbadger> now the only thing we nned is a way to import/add new levels
[3:39:17] <%Solid_Stro> Such an anime weapon
[3:39:18] <$Draylle> what even is the gameplay for Elden Ring?
[3:39:18] <Valentinius_Anodyne> It's okay tho, my favorite Elden Ring boss is in this :)
[3:39:20] <+Sapientiae> it would be crazy if from soft made this an official version of the game
[3:39:20] <jhonxiolonn> youhave to shoot it without locking
[3:39:22] <$valkuma> beezushrist FROM cant even outdo FROM. theyre too busy making swamp levels
[3:39:25] <%optimasmaximas> YEYEYEYEYE
[3:39:26] <andiianfii> @Keyd00d he was wrong, it is the only thing the mod is missing for me
[3:39:27] <Fien111> So is this some big breakthrough that let them mod better like cracking the sourcecode or just PUTTIN IN DA WORK?
[3:39:28] <SuperBloodWolfMoon> Did Pat pick up the Dashmaster's String? That thing makews combat hilarious.
[3:39:28] <sperium3000> @Draylle no one knoooooows
[3:39:30] <%SpicyCheeseNips> Wait does this class start with the blueblood sword or did Pat pick it up already.
[3:39:30] <%GalacticLatte> Here we go!
[3:39:32] <+ATorL> Can you do bare-knuckle power fisting like DS2 Covenant of Champions' Vanquisher's Seal let you do?
[3:39:34] <lilredmage> Pew Pew!
[3:39:40] <%Ascethetic> @PatStaresAt does this mod have all of the Moonlight Greatswords?
[3:39:41] <Calek> @SpicyCheeseNips picked it up
[3:39:43] <NiftyNox> Show those stairs whos boss
[3:39:46] <QuestionableDes> Maybe blueblood would be better there
[3:39:47] <+Sapientiae> kill it pat
[3:39:48] <%GalacticLatte> No no keep fighting it!
[3:39:48] <%radiocrawler> I just recently started a DS3 playthrough. This is going to make me want to abandon that one and fire up this Cinders mod.
[3:39:57] <%SpicyCheeseNips> @Calek Ahh ok
[3:40:00] <beezushrist> @valkuma Sekiro was a good addition to what they've already put out so i disagree
[3:40:04] <%Shadicara> LUL
[3:40:09] <%heartlesshealer> FIRE IS HOT, PROFESSOR
[3:40:10] <%Order_of_Mystery> @Ascethetic It has the MLGS, a one-handed version, and if you infuse it with certain elements, it will CHANGE APPEARANCE
[3:40:10] <SuperBloodWolfMoon> @radiocrawler I definitely suggest trying it. Lots of fun. Some real goofy stuff, too, but very fun.
[3:40:11] <$valkuma> beezushrist ??? sekiro was a rhythm game, its not really applicable
[3:40:11] <the_sword_of_dusk> @PatStaresAt I just read your tweets about Doom Eternal. Fuck Bethesda and Zenimax
[3:40:13] <%lotharrio> Use binocs for aiming?
[3:40:15] <+LTKonnor> lul
[3:40:21] <%Solid_Stro> The Jojo stand mod is amazing LUL
[3:40:23] <+Sapientiae> he doesn't have them
[3:40:27] <$Timesteel> the one thing that kinda sucks about this mod is the movesets for a lot of weapons are completely different than they are in their original games
[3:40:28] <%GalacticLatte> Care if you attack it from here it CAN shoot fire at you
[3:40:30] <NiftyNox> bonk
[3:40:37] <sperium3000> @beezushrist Man I replayed Sekiro recently. It has its problems but it's still super great. I'd be down for a Sekiro 2.
[3:40:37] <%radiocrawler> Thanks @SuperBloodWolfMoon I will definitely be giving it a go.
[3:40:38] <beezushrist> @valkuma Spoken like a person who has never played Sekiro LOL

[3:40:53] <whitewhiskeygamer> Dude, can you imagine if the Black Knights had some of the Lothric Knight shield combat skills?
[3:40:55] <ExpressNode> @the_sword_of_dusk What happened with that?
[3:40:55] <%SpicyCheeseNips> I love that miracles give you essentially unlimited healing
[3:40:57] <beezushrist> @sperium3000 I'm down for DLC
[3:40:58] <%heartlesshealer> drink and finish your dragon fight

[3:41:23] <%SpicyCheeseNips> @Kraigerex1 Nope FP just regenerates now
[3:41:24] <+GenesisKnight> That's the best
[3:41:25] <TallGuyWithAHoodie> @Kraigerex1 FP recovers naturally in this mod

[3:41:34] <beezushrist> @sperium3000 I know... WTF happened there lol?
[3:41:36] <%SpicyCheeseNips> @Kraigerex1 You CAN make FP recovering gear tho
[3:41:38] <lilredmage> Clever Ted
[3:41:38] <%GalacticLatte> Your best bet is shooting at it from inside the room
[3:41:42] <%Solid_Stro> Ow
[3:41:46] <mostundesired> FYI, that was in the vanila game. I found out myself the other day.
[3:41:48] <$valkuma> @beezushrist *** fromsoft fanboys ResidentSleeper
[3:41:49] <%CursedNobleman> he hates it LUL
[3:41:50] <%GalacticLatte> Or on the stairs where you were
[3:41:51] <%radiocrawler> I know if you fire at the dragon from the bonfire he burns that area. I didn't know about this area in front of the door.
[3:41:55] <jhonxiolonn> just shoot his wing
[3:42:04] <%cowardman93> cowardman93 subscribed with Twitch Prime. They've subscribed for 5 months! Hey Pat, I got into Heavensward in FF14 the other week and am loving it so far. I still need to do crystal tower though but having 24 people makes me intimidated, do you have any tips for overcoming the fear of working with such a large number of people?
[3:42:06] <%starotter70> NICE
[3:42:06] <sperium3000> @beezushrist Probably Activision didn't have confidence in it enough to bankroll DLC
[3:42:08] <Kraigerex1> @SpicyCheeseNips I see, thanks!
[3:42:09] <%Valdorick> Omni-wiffing
[3:42:10] <%FacetiousAF> miss them all, peter

[3:42:22] <%maenos2> WHIFF
[3:42:22] <%radiocrawler> The FP regen is fucking dope.
[3:42:25] <%SpicyCheeseNips> Pat does Plague know about this mod yet or nah?
[3:42:26] <the_sword_of_dusk> @ExpressNode They added a new type of DRM to Doom Eternal that access unnecessary parts of your system, weeks after the game came out. This was done without any choice or notification for owners of the game
[3:42:28] <$ItsRatman> Bruh you your ironsights
[3:42:33] <%GalacticLatte> It has an odd hitbox chatr
[3:42:38] <olm46> Did the dragon kinda forget about Pat?
[3:42:39] <Calek> @cowardman93 you're still working with your own group of 8 people, there's just two other groups of 8 that are doing their own thing

[3:43:06] <Fien111> Ah, the Carry Sword
[3:43:07] <%GalacticLatte> can't do it cause you don't have the stats
[3:43:07] <Devilkirbyfan> the drake sword actually scales?
[3:43:08] <%cowardman93> the NOOB master sword
[3:43:09] <ExpressNode> @the_sword_of_dusk Oh yeah I think I heard about that. Glad I didn't buy it yet.
[3:43:10] <%heartlesshealer> USE THE SWORD MAGIC, PAT
[3:43:12] <Jrocy247> No power wave though
[3:43:13] <%FacetiousAF> pat you HAVE to rock the dragon, dragon
[3:43:13] <%BigLoserJosh> very
[3:43:14] <%Valdorick> Wait, does it have the shockwave
[3:43:15] <%Valdorick> or no?
[3:43:15] <+aslfrasle> @cowardman93 When it comes to the 24-man raids in FFXIV, espeically the older ones, you really don't need to worry at all. Most of the time, people will pretty much carry new people through since they can pretty much do it on their own.
[3:43:17] <%Order_of_Mystery> Pat don't have the stats, but yes, it does still do its slap attack
[3:43:20] <%radiocrawler> Except that's a dragon and not a drake.
[3:43:24] <Personified134> @Valdorick he has no str or dex to use it
[3:43:25] <FourLeafLover> it's like poetry, itrhymes
[3:43:28] <Jontman42> didn't meet stat requirements
[3:43:28] <%Taisuru> @Valdorick Yes but pat doesn't have the stats
[3:43:29] <%Valdorick> Ah
[3:43:31] <Shishi1205> he has not enoguh points to do the special ability?
[3:43:34] <+ConLin_Arts_> I used that sword for most of my run when I first played Dark Souls back in the day
[3:43:35] <beezushrist> @sperium3000 Activision only helped them publish it here in the States. From had the option to make DLC
[3:43:35] <%cowardman93> you've probably said already but where do you download this mod?
[3:43:36] <%SpicyCheeseNips> This time it DOESN'T use durability!
[3:43:43] <Jontman42> claymore is a workhorse
[3:43:43] <benjiFG> claymore is a good manga I agree
[3:43:44] <Fien111> best sword, only sowrd
[3:43:45] <+hax_metatron> Playmore with the Claymore
[3:43:45] <%Order_of_Mystery> @cowardman93 over on the nexus
[3:43:48] <%radiocrawler> Claymore best sword since forever.
[3:43:48] <the_sword_of_dusk> @ExpressNode Bethesda always finds away to waste any gathered goodwill

[3:43:49] <@SoFarFetched> https://www.nexusmods.com/darksouls3/mods/310
[3:43:49] <DSD24> Does the claymore have the cool sheath on the back?
[3:43:49] <BallerSwagBro9k> NEXUS MOD
[3:43:54] <%Ninestempest> 2.2 gigs
[3:43:55] <%cowardman93> sick, thanks dude
[3:43:55] <TheArrow_> 2 gigs or so
[3:43:55] <@SoFarFetched> I posted the link for it.
[3:43:56] <+QuadraticGravity> @cowardman93 nexusmods is the primary download site, it's about 2.5gb
[3:43:56] <BallerSwagBro9k> 2,2Gb
[3:43:56] <skyentombment> Ok, now all that this mod is missing is that option in ds 2 where you could burn a special item to make the boss reappear
[3:43:57] <Jrocy247> *VORTEX
[3:44:03] <Calek> the nexus page has the already up to date version too with the option of previous versions
[3:44:03] <skyentombment> and it'll be perfect
[3:44:04] <+EyeFarted> CLAYMORE IS MY FAVORITE
[3:44:04] <%heartlesshealer> Double Mimic Room <3
[3:44:04] <+AbnormalVoid> claymore is booooring
[3:44:05] <%cowardman93> cause this shit looks so damn fun
[3:44:08] <+RD_nx> I want the Drakewing Ultra Greatsword to be in this mod, specifically for the way it looks
[3:44:09] <tubit> Member when Drake sword was the best sword in DS1? Those were the days
[3:44:09] <%Keyd00d> @SoFarFetched Thanks
[3:44:10] <Zombrocom> @skyentombment Um... about that

[3:44:29] <gluttonousmimic> Best room!
[3:44:30] <%heartlesshealer> Nexus mod site
[3:44:34] <BallerSwagBro9k> Cant use with Vortex
[3:44:34] <Aydarkzero> beefy monkaS
[3:44:35] <+Sapientiae> and you can fight harder versions of them
[3:44:36] <Shishi1205> close
[3:44:37] <Whiskey_T_Foxtrot> WOW that dodge
[3:44:39] <Kraigerex1> PogChamp
[3:44:39] <%Keyd00d> FUCKO
[3:44:41] <DSD24> I cast SWORD
[3:44:41] <Fien111> Vortex is the shitshow that replaced Nexus Mod Manager and is functionally useless
[3:44:44] <skyentombment> queue Woolie saying "PURRFECSHUN"
[3:44:49] <$GoopyAvacado> I hope elden ring is good. I didnt care for sekiro
[3:44:56] <+Kataiser> That staff is super good for the flashsword
[3:44:57] <Shishi1205> That stun is really good
[3:44:58] <+hax_metatron> DS1 Poise right there
[3:45:03] <%darshiido_> If anyone was wondering, this mod changes done stuff in the DLC too. For example, some DLC weapons are found in the main game instead, and a DLC boss is changed
[3:45:12] <%heartlesshealer> Braille Tome
[3:45:13] <Jrocy247> Didn't Nexus replace their Nexusmod for Vortex?
[3:45:18] <%SpicyCheeseNips> @skyentombment You can re-fight bosses limitlessly after you kill them. You then get their soul item, souls, and rekindled.
[3:45:18] <spoiledbadger> no
[3:45:19] <gluttonousmimic> My children...
[3:45:22] <Whiskey_T_Foxtrot> What a... miraculous prize
[3:45:22] <+Sapientiae> holy shit halos is insane with a miracle build
[3:45:22] <+SlappyMeats> yeah, forget Vortex, Mod Organizer 2 is the jam
[3:45:24] <Calek> @GoopyAvacado think I read an article where FromSoft said Sekiro was a departure from rpg mechanics, Elden Ring is going to double down on them so I'm excited for it
[3:45:30] <Fien111> @Jrocy247 Yup, and it sucks
[3:45:30] <andiianfii> @Jrocy247 only their mod launcher
[3:45:32] <RrenKrieg> @Jrocy247 that's the mod manager
[3:45:32] <spoiledbadger> votex is serperate
[3:45:35] <skyentombment> OOOOOH MY GOD
[3:45:36] <laserbeaming> Mod Organizer 2 is fantastic
[3:45:40] <+Sapientiae> go upstairs!
[3:45:40] <MelGibsonsKosherAdventure> Magic actually seems not lame now, good job mod creator
[3:45:42] <%heartlesshealer> vortex is the manager program
[3:45:44] <+oda_flobunaga> what does this do to the dancer?
[3:45:46] <$GoopyAvacado> @calek well that's good to hear then
[3:45:49] <skyentombment> PEAK mod right here, literally no downsides
[3:45:53] <%Keyd00d> Hoping Elden is shown off during digital video game announcements this summer
[3:45:58] <Shishi1205> No bonfire
[3:45:58] <%heartlesshealer> ENJOY
[3:46:00] <RrenKrieg> @MelGibsonsKosherAdventure just you wait for the crazier spells
[3:46:00] <Zombrocom> Oh hey friend

[3:46:01] <Jontman42> YOU'RE JUST HERE
[3:46:02] <TallGuyWithAHoodie> HI
[3:46:02] <BallerSwagBro9k> OH BOI
[3:46:03] <NiftyNox> Youre not supposed to be here mister
[3:46:04] <%radiocrawler> Holy fuck
[3:46:05] <skyentombment> HE'S JUST HERE
[3:46:05] <%SharkMissile> O.O
[3:46:05] <%Taisuru> Well hello there
[3:46:06] <the_sword_of_dusk> @darshiido_ I'm going to be a lazy fuck but how big of a change is it to the boss. Is it cosmetic, minor mechanics or full overhall?
[3:46:06] <%dekkitout> Wh- WHYS HE HERE?!
[3:46:07] <+ConLin_Arts_> sbfpRage
[3:46:09] <+SlappyMeats> oh shit a cool guy
[3:46:09] <%starotter70> Hi there
[3:46:12] <+TechnicolorNinja> Earn that bonfire
[3:46:12] <Jrocy247> OH YO, COOL ICE KNIGHTS
[3:46:13] <beezushrist> Magic should definitley be OP, but it should have a HIGH COST associated with it
[3:46:15] <%Order_of_Mystery> as @darshiido_ just says, this changes the DLC too. Folks who like the four knights of Gwyn will want to turn their attention to the champion wolf fight in Ariandal!
[3:46:15] <BallerSwagBro9k> GATSU
[3:46:17] <FourLeafLover> there's a community version of the old nexus mod manager that is still supported
[3:46:19] <Jontman42> that's like the opposite of a bonfire
[3:46:19] <+hax_metatron> Street Fighter 5 damage, DS1 like
[3:46:19] <%heartlesshealer> 👏👏👏👏👏

[3:46:25] <+Kataiser> Outrider country

[3:46:26] <andiianfii> only problem with the mod is the balancing

[3:46:58] <Jrocy247> ZONING
[3:47:00] <+Sapientiae> that lockon distance is very new additon
[3:47:00] <NiftyNox> "Fuck that guy way over there in particular"
[3:47:01] <olm46> That's a bit much
[3:47:03] <gluttonousmimic> That's great!
[3:47:05] <%FacetiousAF> be wary of ranged battle
[3:47:06] <$valkuma> "Player power hasnt increased" *while sniping a mob across the map with infinite magic*
[3:47:06] <$galaxyswirl> LIKE A TRUE ASS MAGE
[3:47:11] <jhonxiolonn> we need woolie here
[3:47:12] <%radiocrawler> Pat playing a mage feels so blasphemous.
[3:47:16] <ralphfromdk> Bow builds can finally be a thing :o
[3:47:17] <%SpicyCheeseNips> MAN I CAN'T WAIT TIL I GET LIGHTNING SPEARS IN MY PLAYTHROUGH OMAHGAWD
[3:47:20] <Zombrocom> @valkuma He said "HAS increased"
[3:47:23] <+hax_metatron> STUNLOCKS
[3:47:23] <+Beefjavelin> so is magic just straight up busted on this mod coz it seems it
[3:47:25] <%lotharrio> Red Phantoms must be a pain.
[3:47:27] <BioApple> ah, I see pat's using the shrine of amana mage build Kappa
[3:47:28] <+EySoyCoco> holy shit that spell
[3:47:30] <%Order_of_Mystery> Player power has increased, but enemies are still just as dangerous, if not more so
[3:47:30] <THELava_lad> what an abyssal fragment?
[3:47:31] <+Sebenoth> Man, sucks to be a console pleb, i wanna try out a bunch of randomizers and mods
[3:47:32] <$valkuma> Zombrocom oh, foodmouth made it sound like "hasnt" LUL
[3:47:33] <andiianfii> game is much easier in mid game to late game
[3:47:37] <%SpicyCheeseNips> @THELava_lad
[3:47:38] <andiianfii> aside from like 3 fights
[3:47:38] <%Taisuru> @Beefjavelin You are aware he's in the first area yes?
[3:47:42] <%dekkitout> Did someone say "crowd control"?
[3:47:42] <+gutlesscoward> man you're like a human blender
[3:47:43] <spoiledbadger> dark edge is a little strong
[3:47:44] <Calek> @THELava_lad covenant item
[3:47:45] <%darshiido_> @order_of_mystery Absolutely correct
[3:47:47] <Zombrocom> @valkuma Yeah, he kinda has that problem a lot LUL
[3:47:47] <NiftyNox> Good
[3:47:47] <%heartlesshealer> LUL
[3:47:48] <%Ixiah> Boooo
[3:47:49] <$rekinom> MY HEXER'SHOOD HAS FINALLY RETURNED TO ME
[3:47:50] <%Ninestempest> define added back
[3:47:50] <Aydarkzero> oh?
[3:47:50] <%optimasmaximas> eh
[3:47:51] <RrenKrieg> @Beefjavelin nah everything is busted, this mod's focus is making every build viable
[3:47:51] <%starotter70> LUL
[3:47:52] <Calek> durability is barely an issue
[3:47:52] <TsunTsuchinoko> why?
[3:47:54] <+MagicMongoose> ew
[3:47:55] <%velemi> boooo
[3:47:56] <olm46> Durability was always bad.
[3:47:57] <mostundesired> Durability DansGame
[3:47:57] <Equirah> BOOOOOOOO
[3:47:57] <%heartlesshealer> fair
[3:47:58] <Valentinius_Anodyne> It's not DS2 levels tho
[3:47:58] <LunarRemix> But it always was a thing, no?
[3:47:59] <LeBlanc233> boo
[3:47:59] <Fien111> no thank you
[3:48:00] <+ATorL> DS1 style or DS2 style?
[3:48:00] <+Beefjavelin> @Taisuru yeah and he's rocking high end sorceries with infinite FP pool
[3:48:00] <+oda_flobunaga> NOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOO
[3:48:01] <%Ninestempest> why care about durability
[3:48:03] <Calek> nowhere near DS2 levels
[3:48:05] <+hax_metatron> Ir's not that bad
[3:48:05] <spoiledbadger> ds2 style
[3:48:07] <figleafplays> but why
[3:48:07] <Gallhint> POISE IS BACK
[3:48:08] <%Ninestempest> it's dumb pointless bullshit
[3:48:09] <%Order_of_Mystery> @THELava_lad a covenant item for one of the new Covenants, led by Karla the witch!
[3:48:09] <Aydarkzero> wait for weapons or armor?
[3:48:10] <jhonxiolonn> hey chat, it isn't bad
[3:48:12] <Jontman42> eh it's fine, it's a soul sink
[3:48:12] <%Taisuru> @Beefjavelin Everything is good in this mod
[3:48:13] <%radiocrawler> Does durability reset at bonfires or do you have to repair like DS1?
[3:48:14] <Jrocy247> Well THAT'S uneeded
[3:48:14] <Aydarkzero> oh
[3:48:17] <%heartlesshealer> Wait, which FORM of durability?
[3:48:18] <+twohitgood> hopefully not DS2 durability.
[3:48:19] <+Sapientiae> only from meleeing though
[3:48:20] <Devilkirbyfan> ew
[3:48:20] <+astrofizzix> Wow, with that much range it's like being a mage in the Shrine of Amana.
[3:48:23] <+hax_metatron> DS1 poise is definitely back you can see it inn all onne on one fights, player and enemy
[3:48:25] <%Rachet122> figured when i seen the repair powder
[3:48:25] <+oda_flobunaga> TOTALLY UNPLAYABLE Kappa
[3:48:25] <Equirah> any durability is bad
[3:48:26] <worldbrand> oh that's fine then
[3:48:26] <%darshiido_> and NG+ adds MANY new enemy placements +Phantom versions of some enemies
[3:48:28] <beezushrist> I hate that Dark Souls 3 took out most of the RPG el;ements. It sucks, but losing durability is part of the game!!!!
[3:48:30] <jhonxiolonn> it just add a meaning to the repair things
[3:48:30] <%radiocrawler> Gotcha
[3:48:34] <ECRead> ok then that's fine
[3:48:35] <%heartlesshealer> cool
[3:48:38] <+twohitgood> ah that's not bad.
[3:48:39] <Jontman42> oooh
[3:48:41] <+DynDimAcsiwn> that ability looks cool
[3:48:49] <beezushrist> Repairing your equipment should be part of the game
[3:49:07] <+ATorL> I liked DS2 style, just without the framerate causing excessive loss if on PC because the game wasn't made to run at 60 FPS
[3:49:07] <Slimeking_Mike> no
[3:49:08] <+Sebenoth> Durability was a bigger issue in Ng+ runs anyway
[3:49:09] <zocano> High lethality
[3:49:09] <%Order_of_Mystery> *bonk*
[3:49:12] <%SpicyCheeseNips> @THELava_lad Covenant item. All enemies have a 5% chance of dropping the item tied to the covenant you're using, and you use them to trade in items
[3:49:13] <%heartlesshealer> S P E E D
[3:49:14] <$ItsRatman> bonked him
[3:49:18] <jhonxiolonn> right in the head
[3:49:19] <%AncelDeLambert> goddammit, I'm gonna have to play this, but the camera is inverted!
[3:49:21] <jimmytwofeet> I DID NAHTT
[3:49:21] <tegas_> More like Daughters of Ass.
[3:49:22] <%radiocrawler> This mod definitely has me needing it and starting a new playthrough.
[3:49:24] <beezushrist> @ATorL It does on ps4
[3:49:25] <Gallhint> you bashed his fookin ead in m8
[3:49:25] <+TechnicolorNinja> stripGood stripBat
[3:49:25] <+EySoyCoco> bonks go up
[3:49:27] <+oda_flobunaga> So its like ranger hardcore for Dark Souls
[3:49:27] <Slasher9485> Hey I missed the daughter's of ash part of the stream. What were his thoughts on it?
[3:49:31] <jhonxiolonn> yes
[3:49:34] <%bevyrage> i looked away for a second pat. can you do it again?
[3:49:34] <%SpicyCheeseNips> Hell yeah
[3:49:36] <aeonicvector> incorrect, blue flame
[3:49:38] <%AncelDeLambert> I'm in the middle of playing MonHun and there could not be a WORSE GAME TO SWITCH FROM!
[3:49:38] <LegendGHT> Why so much about dark souls now?
[3:49:41] <TallGuyWithAHoodie> @Slasher9485 That it's fucked and unfun
[3:49:43] <Shishi1205> hard, like too much @Slasher9485
[3:49:44] <+Partialrecall2> tell us about your build
[3:49:45] <%dekkitout> Swords and Sorcerers
[3:49:46] <%radiocrawler> Oh shit I didnt realize that was Blue Blood
[3:49:46] <%Order_of_Mystery> This is an example of GOOD fanservice!
[3:49:48] <%darshiido_> He doesn't majorly care for DOA
[3:49:51] <%AncelDeLambert> COMPLETELY backwards controls from DS!
[3:49:54] <+oda_flobunaga> @Slasher9485 Broken in unfun and bs ways
[3:49:56] <%SpicyCheeseNips> Blue flame's cool too, too bad you can't powerstance it in this game
[3:50:02] <Sauceboss15> What Mod is this?
[3:50:02] <%Valdorick> psaBougie Mmmm, yes, the Bluebloods are positivly divine in this sword, yes. psaBougie

[3:50:39] <jimmytwofeet> BUT YOU DIED THO
[3:50:40] <benjiFG> h-hayai..!
[3:50:41] <Calek> @DynDimAcsiwn that's the mod, inherent ability for all classes
[3:50:41] <%radiocrawler> RIP
[3:50:41] <CappuccinoGuil> @DynDimAcsiwn it's automatic now
[3:50:41] <Darkfire346> X GON GIVE IT TO YA
[3:50:42] <jhonxiolonn> there's a bonfire where the rat guy is
[3:50:42] <TallGuyWithAHoodie> @DynDimAcsiwn FP recovers naturally in this mod
[3:50:42] <spoiledbadger> use solaire
[3:50:44] <Jrocy247> Can you get any armor you want from the start like weapons?
[3:50:45] <Valentinius_Anodyne> @DynDimAcsiwn FP regens in this mod
[3:50:45] <BioApple> How much of DOA did he play? I played about up through Sen's and I thought it was easier than vanilla
[3:50:48] <+DynDimAcsiwn> OH it's a mod
[3:50:49] <lilredmage> @DynDimAcsiwn natural MP recovery
[3:50:51] <%SpicyCheeseNips> I accidently started my playthrough with one of the vanilla classes without even knowing about the new ones.
[3:50:53] <+oda_flobunaga> FIGHT DANCER pls
[3:51:00] <%Order_of_Mystery> @DynDimAcsiwn the mod adds FP regen for everyone. it recovers faster if you have a staff/chime/pyro flame equipped
[3:51:02] <damnvier> the sword seems pointless with that much fp regen tho
[3:51:05] <+DynDimAcsiwn> that explains that dude lmao
[3:51:06] <beezushrist> Fuck dem dogs
[3:51:09] <%mister___doctor> Pat dont forget to mac out Lautrecs confidant
[3:51:15] <koolkatdq> Dancer fight
[3:51:17] <TallGuyWithAHoodie> @BioApple He used the Master Key to hit the Darkroot Forest and gave up at the bullshit invisible crystal golems
[3:51:19] <Calek> the most power Dark Souls abilitiy, running
[3:51:20] <%BLK_HRLQN_13> You know, I wish durability was the gauge for using skills on weapons instead of fp in DS3.
[3:51:30] <$Billyuppercut0> Man I really want to play this mod so that I can make a PyroMage
[3:51:35] <%SpicyCheeseNips> Pat do you have the infinite running ring?
[3:51:39] <@SoFarFetched> yeah he has it on
[3:51:42] <%Taisuru> @BLK_HRLQN_13 That would be disgusting, please no
[3:51:44] <gluttonousmimic> ChooChoo!!!
[3:51:45] <%silverira> @PatStaresAt don't you have the ring of infinite sprint?

[3:52:00] <+superkeaton> LUL
[3:52:00] <TallGuyWithAHoodie> He took it off to make comabt less goofy
[3:52:01] <Calek> @PatStaresAt you can't run away from your problems!
[3:52:01] <+Sebenoth> Having to play most of the game just to get a build you like might suck, but at least you can try weapons w/o having the stats for them (unlike BB)
[3:52:05] <%Totally_not_toby> Totally_not_toby subscribed at Tier 1. They've subscribed for 9 months, currently on a 4 month streak! hi pat love you
[3:52:12] <BioApple> @TallGuyWithAHoodie did he not figure out damage types mattered?
[3:52:16] <beezushrist> Those guys usually get staggered when you roll into them. Did they mod that little detail out?
[3:52:19] <%Keyd00d> They're watching
[3:52:20] <%BLK_HRLQN_13> why, just use repair powder guys :3

[3:52:33] <%SpicyCheeseNips> Btw you can ninja flip by default now
[3:52:34] <spoiledbadger> use solaire
[3:52:35] <@SoFarFetched> If you liked it then you should have put a ring on it.
[3:52:39] <tegas_> He's gonna need the ring of infinite squint soon.
[3:52:42] <%optimasmaximas> YEYEYE
[3:52:43] <%SpicyCheeseNips> incase you didn't know alrady
[3:52:45] <Jrocy247> @DSD24 he's been in. just not THIS area

[3:52:48] <AliceAstro> weeee!!
[3:52:50] <kill24play> Hey Pat n Chat, this game is on PC right?
[3:52:54] <%radiocrawler> Nice, a ring for boss running.
[3:52:54] <$Billyuppercut0> Frosty
[3:52:55] <@SoFarFetched> PC yes
[3:52:56] <NiftyNox> vineSanic
[3:52:58] <jhonxiolonn> Crazy talk
[3:52:59] <%optimasmaximas> @kill24play ye
[3:53:00] <Darkfire346> GET GOT
[3:53:01] <beezushrist> Fuck dem dogs
[3:53:03] <%Order_of_Mystery> @kill24play yep, its a mod on the nexus
[3:53:03] <TallGuyWithAHoodie> @BioApple He was uninterested to begin with, and being told to swap weapons probably would've been the nail in the coffin anyways
[3:53:11] <SnaKemuho> does it go offline automatically to avoid ban?
[3:53:14] <damnvier> iam downloading cinders right now.. thanks for showcasing man
[3:53:15] <DSD24> @Jrocy247 OH ok that makes sense, thanks for the clarification
[3:53:17] <+Jasek7> just roll down the hole
[3:53:19] <Valentinius_Anodyne> @SnaKemuho Yes
[3:53:22] <spoiledbadger> use it does go offlie auto
[3:53:26] <kill24play> Tyvm Chat n Pat, I appreciate it
[3:53:28] <cherrycottontail> Is the enemy placement any different?
[3:53:30] <EuropanLamprey> I just got here, does the mod actually give you Dark Edge this early?
[3:53:31] <jhonxiolonn> go to rat's cell, there's a bonfire
[3:53:37] <+superkeaton> @damnvier Make sure to switch Steam to offline mode before playing
[3:53:38] <%SpicyCheeseNips> RUNNING IN THE 90s
[3:53:38] <beezushrist> @PatStaresAt Remember, there's a ledge you can roll onto instead of taking that ladder
[3:53:40] <spoiledbadger> yes it does go offline atomatically
[3:53:40] <Zombrocom> I think pats main issue with DOA was he knew Cinders existed, and just wanted to play that instead
[3:53:41] <+twohitgood> the ring of hotfootinit
[3:53:44] <TallGuyWithAHoodie> @BioApple Also technically he stopped at the Moonlight Butterfly + Golden Crystal Golem boss
[3:53:47] <+JVolfram> Greetings Patonians
[3:53:48] <damnvier> will do, will do.
[3:53:49] <%dekkitout> Is enemy placement different? Well ya see this boreal knight...
[3:53:51] <%Order_of_Mystery> @SnaKemuho yep, there's an ini file in the mod that forces you to go offline by default. you can enable online, but it will ban you, but you can play with other Cinders folks using the code
[3:53:54] <Fujiwara_92> @cherrycottontail nah it's the same Kappa
[3:53:57] <%Zaphire_Saucypants> just not Ash.
[3:53:58] <Whiskey_T_Foxtrot> fight him, nerd
[3:53:58] <the_sword_of_dusk> So close

[3:54:01] <Swagsouls> You don't need to use that ladder, there's a little ledge you can roll onto, and then off of, and receive no fall damage

[3:54:04] <%Taisuru> @EuropanLamprey Yes, as one of the starer classes, as you can see, enemies are aggressive enough to compensate

[3:54:13] <%Order_of_Mystery> @PatStaresAt go down below to where you get Greirat, there's something there that'll help you
[3:54:15] <Valentinius_Anodyne> The boreal knights are nasty
[3:54:16] <+Partialrecall2> damn i thought watching woolie play was bad

[3:54:17] <%michingmallecho> You thought it was Ash but it was I, ASH
[3:54:21] <tubit> Ok, I got a good feeling about this try. This time it's gonna work out

[3:55:04] <%spiritofmojave> @brother_coduss might be an fov thing?
[3:55:08] <Brother_Coduss> huh....for some reason it just looks like his character gets shorter every respawn
[3:55:11] <+Sebenoth> zooming put from sprinting maybe
[3:55:15] <Shishi1205> Btw chat Item only runs are indeed posible
[3:55:16] <Decc> glad to see you're havin fun with this

[3:59:00] <Brother_Coduss> did he just get a boss item from some rando enemy?

[4:01:33] <+metalsiren31> It always did
[4:01:33] <+Kataiser> Dark weapon spellbuff scales off both INT and FTH. The all-scaling is for the thwack with the stick

[4:01:46] <Aydarkzero> @PatStaresAt is there a stat that increases regen speed or is that only class/armor?
[4:01:50] <%bread_assassin> Attunement also reduces fall damage. Ok, sure. Why not?
[4:01:54] <beezushrist> @Mrbaconator Dex = cast faster
[4:01:55] <jhonxiolonn> @PatStaresAt you forgot to forge some bonewards
[4:01:56] <%thegreenbenis> @PatStaresAt Hey Pat, the Doom Eternal store page on Steam is fucking shitting itself.
[4:01:56] <ECRead> it did that. unless they made it even faster
[4:01:59] <THELava_lad> @patstaresat is the dlc also modded
[4:01:59] <lilredmage> you got your dex in my spellcasting! "yeah well you got your spellcasting in my dex!"

[4:04:34] <Rionxgarland> rip fred willard
[4:04:36] <+Kataiser> Apparently Denuvo (the company) is saying there will be a future update that lets you run it in offline mode. It'll take away all your event cosmetics and disable MP though.
[4:04:37] <Josef_Stryker> Man I hate how weak magic felt in DS3 especially compared to DS2
[4:04:38] <+Order_of_Mystery> you can jump to the roof that fucker was shooting your from Pat

[4:04:44] <OperatorPlease> so what's the advantage to NOT spellcasting then?
[4:04:47] <%Taisuru> @Jakeofalco he's only leveled up a few times, game is just very feast or famine with the mod
[4:04:50] <%radiocrawler> It's like Demon's Souls spellcasting.
[4:04:51] <+SinisterBroccoli> Wait isn't that hood from DS2?

[4:05:14] <Josef_Stryker> Was that hood in DS3 before?
[4:05:14] <%heartlesshealer> spellcasting is just the most dramatic of the improvements
[4:05:15] <Personified134> also yes poise now exists for the melee boys
[4:05:15] <Bloodhit> Wait, is that the mode that was also for DS1?
[4:05:17] <+Kataiser> Melee builds in Cinders have poise now, as well as melee armor generally having way better defenses.
[4:05:18] <lilredmage> big poise for big boys
[4:05:18] <Dova573> I thought it was ok
[4:05:19] <NiftyNox> fucking thank you

[4:06:08] <fat_burtreynolds> Big poise making big noise
[4:06:10] <Josef_Stryker> @Sebenoth It was fine but compared to DS2 it wasn't great
[4:06:11] <%heartlesshealer> MUST JUMP
[4:06:12] <lilredmage> see? spell casters can't jump
[4:06:15] <%Order_of_Mystery> nope, time to jump good
[4:06:16] <%GalacticLatte> You're jumping at a weird angle
[4:06:17] <+lethallylactic> Try taking off armor
[4:06:17] <Josef_Stryker> DS2 magic was amazing imo
[4:06:18] <%SpicyCheeseNips> You guys remember the early days of DS2 where the lightning spears were actually good? I sure do, and it was glorius.
[4:06:22] <jhonxiolonn> Poise is like super armor
[4:06:23] <Jrocy247> Git Gud at Jump.
[4:06:24] <%GalacticLatte> Just jump straight from the corner

[4:06:36] <+Sebenoth> Yeah, again, DS2 has a special place in my heart for the sheer build variety
[4:06:36] <mostundesired> @Dova573 In DS1? You don't get staggered by hits. In DS3 vanilla, you don't get staggered whilst doing certain attacks.
[4:06:43] <NiftyNox> People arguing FOR DS3 poise like they gotta defend a company when it just legit doesnt work LUL
[4:06:45] <beezushrist> @SpicyCheeseNips The Olden days
[4:06:47] <+RandomMishaps> Is the fall damage now like DS2?
[4:06:53] <Josef_Stryker> So what changed in this mod?
[4:06:54] <+RandomMishaps> You seem to take a lot from small drops
[4:06:55] <Lophostrix_> @Sebenoth I did a pyro playthrough recently and it honestly felt OP, especially against aldrich
[4:07:00] <$Metal_Slime_King> This mod add a shit ton of spells,
[4:07:00] <Aydarkzero> poise LUL
[4:07:00] <mostundesired> Hitboxes.
[4:07:02] <Josef_Stryker> Is it basically a rebalance of DS3?
[4:07:03] <jhonxiolonn> that hitbox is weird
[4:07:12] <%SuttonsGaming> Josef_Stryker MUCH more
[4:07:12] <thegraveyarder> allo
[4:07:13] <%Order_of_Mystery> @Josef_Stryker a LOT. there's a wiki that has the changelog, and its big

[4:07:23] <%kapcommunist> that enemy is me. sitting in breakable pots
[4:07:25] <NiftyNox> looks like the tip of the dark edge doesnt have a hitbox?
[4:07:26] <beezushrist> I usually play as pyro/sorcerer and that tends to be OP
[4:07:27] <%GalacticLatte> @PatStaresAt That's what I told ya :>
[4:07:27] <Zerud> dear lord what is that magic regen?
[4:07:31] <zocano> why?

[4:07:50] <%SpicyCheeseNips> So Pat any ideas about your end game build yet? You going straight dark sorcery a spell sword kinda dealy?
[4:07:54] <beezushrist> They said fuck Magic estus, let the magic regen lol
[4:07:54] <%SuttonsGaming> Josef_Stryker for example, armor give stats and there are like 15-20 different starting classes
[4:07:59] <%SuttonsGaming> and that's only the start
[4:08:10] <Aydarkzero> @Metal_Slime_King forgot about Limit Breakers i gotta go see that channel again
[4:08:17] <Jontman42> so hey is this actually just Dark Souls 3 but better?
[4:08:24] <%SuttonsGaming> yes

[4:08:30] <$ItsRatman> oh boy this room
[4:08:34] <mostundesired> Nice.
[4:08:34] <jhonxiolonn> the only reason for estus magic now is to spam proyectiles

[4:09:09] <Billyuppercut0> That’s Dark Souls
[4:09:15] <beezushrist> Can they alter the environments to make it so floors collapse that didn't before?

[4:13:13] <Sotetsu> Magic seems OP now. Is the game rebalanced for it?
[4:13:14] <BallerSwagBro9k> Plz don't farm me LUL
[4:13:16] <+skylerpilot> there is a crazy new kick animation too. Have you done it yet @PatStaresAt ?
[4:13:18] <%YakumoYomi> "Better Dark Souls 3". Got it.
[4:13:21] <CappuccinoGuil> wait, what did he say about grinding?
[4:13:23] <lordchum1150> I wonder if some ds2 style soulcost casting is in here somewhere
[4:13:24] <Gregorhasjoined> Man...
[4:13:26] <+hax_metatron> @Sotetsu Easy early, not so much later onn
[4:13:27] <%GalacticLatte> The resident invader npc's in this are nuts strong
[4:13:28] <SnaKemuho> I still don't understand From's obsession with rare weapons that aren't even good most of the time
[4:13:28] <fat_burtreynolds> Swag 420 blaze it sword
[4:13:29] <+oda_flobunaga> But what if you want to have ten chances to get something?
[4:13:29] <%cowardman93> wow they actually fixed getting all the items
[4:13:36] <%dekkitout> It's no tatsu
[4:13:37] <Jontman42> good
[4:13:39] <Gregorhasjoined> This overhaul has everything
[4:13:40] <+lethallylactic> There's a different kick for fist weapons
[4:13:40] <+skylerpilot> @PatStaresAt huh, I started as brawler. I have a spinning back kick
[4:13:44] <fat_burtreynolds> One weird trick
[4:13:44] <jhonxiolonn> oh boy, i wonder if faith is also cool to use now
[4:13:48] <%Order_of_Mystery> @PatStaresAt that cleric's parma has HP regen, I believe!
[4:13:50] <+Kataiser> Enemies that drop gear respawn with NG+ cycle if you want more than one.
[4:13:52] <fat_burtreynolds> Grinders hate it
[4:13:52] <andiianfii> i think the kick animation is only different on fist weapons
[4:13:55] <+QuadraticGravity> @skylerpilot that's because brawler starts with a kick boost ring
[4:13:59] <Sotetsu> @hax_metatron That's good to hear. Is using magic strongly encouraged now?
[4:14:00] <%radiocrawler> For some reason the kick came out all annoying in DS3.
[4:14:00] <+QuadraticGravity> it's the horsehoof ring
[4:14:01] <BioApple> can you do the mimic kick
[4:14:02] <Valentinius_Anodyne> Fist weapons are rad in this mod
[4:14:05] <+JVolfram> Wish I had the patience and fortitude for this game
[4:14:05] <Gregorhasjoined> YO
[4:14:06] <royb2> Is stuff like the white hair talisman actually viable in this mod
[4:14:08] <+twohitgood> so woolie needs to play this as brawler, then?
[4:14:14] <bigdumbidiotguy> chicken bacon camels
[4:14:16] <%Taisuru> But when's the ball buster from godhand
[4:14:18] <+hax_metatron> @Sotetsu No, but it's rebalanced because it was unusable before
[4:14:21] <%radiocrawler> Fighting Games!
[4:14:24] <RrenKrieg> @twohitgood YES YES YES YES PLEASE
[4:14:29] <%SpicyCheeseNips> @jhonxiolonn bruh its so good. barely even need to use estus to heal anymore.
[4:14:35] <Sotetsu> @hax_metatron Nice, I'm looking forward to trying this!
[4:14:40] <NiftyNox> Fantastic to hear
[4:14:41] <PKHTjim> Essentially this is bug fixed with the Cinder mod.
[4:14:46] <lordchum1150> I miss emlo
[4:14:47] <+skylerpilot> @QuadraticGravity I thought so, but then I still had the kick after I took the ring off
[4:14:47] <%Order_of_Mystery> Hey Pat, do you think Woolie would like this mod? Especially if Fist weapons give you sick ass animations?
[4:14:47] <%cowardman93> have they made it so your weight is only affected by what's on your body and not in your other equipment slots?
[4:14:48] <%Emperor_Machinus> I am guessing pvp is out of the question with this mod?
[4:14:49] <fat_burtreynolds> Tatsu no maki spicy mayo attacc sbfpLiam
[4:14:55] <+linSP> Did pat pick up the censer palm or whatever it is with the new kick animation
[4:15:01] <RrenKrieg> @Emperor_Machinus it's still there
[4:15:03] <+photas10> this is a mod ?
[4:15:04] <%fetrigon> FE?
[4:15:04] <lilredmage> Gimmick Weapons are fun and Regular Weapons are useful. Dope
[4:15:07] <+superkeaton> I hope it fixed the magic dagger from the DLC
[4:15:09] <@SoFarFetched> It is a mod yes
[4:15:15] <%radiocrawler> This mod really does fix DS3. This is fantastic.
[4:15:15] <RrenKrieg> @superkeaton it did
[4:15:16] <+BaronVonFatty> the irithyll weapons with this mod would be sick
[4:15:16] <royb2> Yay I can go Pyro/faith build legit?
[4:15:22] <+superkeaton> @RrenKrieg Perfect
[4:15:25] <jhonxiolonn> and you only have 2 SPELLS
[4:15:27] <jhonxiolonn> imagine later
[4:15:30] <%Order_of_Mystery> @royb2 you can, and they KICK ASS
[4:15:31] <+Kataiser> There's even a special flame for pyro/faith hybrids.
[4:15:32] <Valentinius_Anodyne> It's everything I ever wanted from Dark Souls spellcasting
[4:15:33] <%SpicyCheeseNips> @royb2 Bruh theres a MIRACLE PYRO FLAME
[4:15:44] <%cowardman93> honestly this looks so damn good it's nuts
[4:15:46] <andiianfii> aside from the kcik being different and some fist weapons getting the claw WA, the fist weapon movesets are pretty boring
[4:15:48] <+Quinn_Carter> Does two handing the staff do anything?
[4:15:49] <RrenKrieg> @superkeaton been fighting jedi cosplayers in the pvp a few months ago
[4:15:49] <Tiewolf> I wish I can play this online
[4:15:50] <Gregorhasjoined> New bonfires?!?!?
[4:15:51] <%Agami23> what about corrosive mist that can break equipment?
[4:15:52] <NiftyNox> Did they buff Immolation Kappa
[4:15:53] <shurtal> We get to be dirty hexers again?
[4:15:53] <+lethallylactic> Some spells that bosses use can now be obtained, which is fun
[4:15:53] <royb2> @SpicyCheeseNips pog I know my first run
[4:15:54] <$Metal_Slime_King> Is Pryomancy viable now?!
[4:15:55] <Broskie899> Y O U K N O W W H A T I M S A Y I N G
[4:15:57] <beezushrist> having a fast metabolism sucks
[4:15:59] <%Order_of_Mystery> OH YES, THERE ARE PYROMANCY FLAMES THAT CAN CASE EVERY OTHER SCHOOL OF MAGIC
[4:16:00] <+linSP> this is the smash ultimate of dark souls
[4:16:00] <TheReaperofGrim> Can you co-op with this mod?
[4:16:05] <aeonicvector> @Tiewolf It does, no ones been reading
[4:16:06] <lilredmage> Step 1. High Faith Step 2. High Int. Step 3 ??? Step 4 Profit
[4:16:07] <%GohanHitsugaya> Do any of those spells suck your dick for you?
[4:16:07] <@SoFarFetched> man this would be so broken if you went online with this.
[4:16:08] <+lethallylactic> @Agami23 Scraping Spear is in the game, its weapon art is corrosive mist.
[4:16:11] <lordchum1150> I’m gonna make Elmo into a DND boss
[4:16:13] <+wirblewomble> has he said how much he's gonna play of this?
[4:16:16] <aeonicvector> you can play online with this mod, but you WILL get put into the banned server
[4:16:16] <NiftyNox> YO new weird pyro flames is what I like to hear
[4:16:16] <%cowardman93> but is it affinity or pursuers in this one?
[4:16:18] <zocano> This absolutely feels like someone that really likes Dark Souls 2's diversity way too much and thought "what if DS3 tho?"
[4:16:20] <aeonicvector> aka cheater jail
[4:16:22] <BioApple> @TheReaperofGrim if you're willing to get softbanned yes
[4:16:23] <%CuttleCrow> so if I play this online I basically can never play normal DS3 online? (unless I want to play with cheaters)
[4:16:29] <%Emperor_Machinus> @GohanHitsugaya Yes, but you lose humanity each time
[4:16:29] <stormhawk9891> @PatStaresAt What are the changes to FP?
[4:16:32] <%YakumoYomi> Download Cinders today. =whispers= It's free real estate...
[4:16:32] <bigdumbidiotguy> if u fart into the mic u become invinisble
[4:16:43] <andiianfii> @CuttleCrow you can play on a family sharing account to avoid that
[4:16:44] <beezushrist> @cuttlecrow Yea
[4:16:44] <%Taisuru> @CuttleCrow Make a secondary account and activate the family sharing with it
[4:16:45] <%GohanHitsugaya> @Emperor_Machinus LUL
[4:16:47] <Tiewolf> @GohanHitsugaya chat goes do danm fast when you are high
[4:16:51] <$Metal_Slime_King> What about the legendary miracle build? Maybe can actually do one now.
[4:16:53] <spoiledbadger> 5% regen
[4:16:55] <+th3madness> so what's the payoff for not destroying everything with magic
[4:16:55] <aeonicvector> @CuttleCrow if you play online, that steam account loses access
[4:16:57] <%CuttleCrow> ohhh
[4:16:58] <PKHTjim> Holy shit.
[4:16:58] <Whiskey_T_Foxtrot> oh hey it's a fun mechanic now
[4:17:00] <stormhawk9891> Yup
[4:17:01] <%SpicyCheeseNips> mmm delicious fp
[4:17:03] <jhonxiolonn> and you can make it even better
[4:17:07] <+Kataiser> Miracle builds are busted OP now due to FP regen.
[4:17:10] <GarettLefebvre> Classic branch textures
[4:17:11] <+hax_metatron> Just have fun playinng video gam: The mod
[4:17:11] <lilredmage> \{T}/ praise the FP bar
[4:17:12] <%Order_of_Mystery> FP comes back automatically for every class, but faster if you have a casting tool equipped
[4:17:13] <%Taisuru> @th3madness Destroying everything with whatever you do
[4:17:17] <+miamimackjr> is this a mod?
[4:17:17] <+Kataiser> Also Ascended Wrath of God uses the DS1 variant.
[4:17:21] <+Jakeofalco> that abit broken ?
[4:17:23] <@SoFarFetched> Cinders Mod for DS3
[4:17:23] <%SpicyCheeseNips> NINJA FLIP
[4:17:24] <%GohanHitsugaya> @Tiewolf Indeed
[4:17:27] <Jrocy247> @stormhawk9891 Basically, you can FINALLY play a mage if you want to
[4:17:29] <%CuttleCrow> DS3 with POISE?
[4:17:32] <beezushrist> @th3madness you can destroy everything with everything, they just made magic stronger
[4:17:33] <+lethallylactic> 🦀
[4:17:37] <Aydarkzero> @Kataiser NUT
[4:17:40] <bigdumbidiotguy> is there bologna in this game
[4:17:42] <Snirtax> I mean as busted as that is it actually lets you have fun so I'll take it
[4:17:42] <jhonxiolonn> the new spells are atomic bomb level too
[4:17:42] <+HelloImTom08> nothing can be OP if everything is OP
[4:17:43] <%radiocrawler> Ninja flipping is back?
[4:17:45] <Sundaysmiles01> And all the Big Dad stuff is back
[4:17:46] <Valentinius_Anodyne> Yeah, DS3 with poise
[4:17:47] <aeonicvector> so unless your rebuying the game, you go online with this, your go to cheater jail servers, no matter how legit this moded through is
[4:17:48] <%GohanHitsugaya> LUL
[4:17:49] <$Metal_Slime_King> Does this mod change the expansions as well?
[4:17:50] <%Order_of_Mystery> @CuttleCrow not just poise, but PROPER poise like from DS1
[4:17:51] <Jrocy247> SNAKE BROS ARE HERE
[4:17:51] <NiftyNox> Snecko what are u doin here
[4:17:55] <mostundesired> It's not like dex and strength builds are worse, it's just that magic builds are an option now.
[4:17:57] <+PlagueOfGripes> health spongey
[4:17:59] <$ItsRatman> um he's a bit early
[4:17:59] <%Taisuru> @Jakeofalco Keep in mind you can advance to whatever NG+ you want from the start of the game, if you find it too easy

[4:18:08] <pal8080> @Metal_Slime_King think so
[4:18:08] <lilredmage> WOW
[4:18:10] <RrenKrieg> as i said everything is broken, the mod is made to make any build viable
[4:18:11] <%SpicyCheeseNips> @radiocrawler you can do it as soon as you start, just need like barely any equip load
[4:18:12] <+Kataiser> If you are willing to live in cheater jail this mod does work 100% with co-op though
[4:18:14] <OldManDeckardCain> more punch weapons? don't tell woolie or the podcast is gonna be real akward with that woolie boner on screen LUL

[4:32:16] <PKHTjim> Is it an AOE?
[4:32:16] <whitewhiskeygamer> It probably does massive Bleed damage Pat

[4:32:25] <+lethallylactic> You can hold it
[4:32:25] <WizardofWazz> ????
[4:32:28] <+linSP> long range bleed
[4:32:29] <%Valdorick> 10% health damage?
[4:32:29] <%doc_ock_rokc> @Order_of_Mystery BLEED
[4:32:29] <$RealThiele> lol the 5k is a % of heal;th
[4:32:31] <+ConLin_Arts_> nnom nom nom nom
[4:32:31] <@SoFarFetched> Hurry pat,Paige will start undressing you otherwise.....with her eyes THEN her hands.
[4:32:33] <%radiocrawler> Yeah what was that 5k damage?
[4:32:33] <CappuccinoGuil> @SpicyCheeseNips LUL
[4:32:34] <%CuttleCrow> HUGE
[4:32:35] <%NecDW4> BIG NUMBER
[4:32:36] <%heartlesshealer> SWARM
[4:32:38] <%xcompleasedad> THAT IS INSANE BLEEd
[4:32:42] <%radiocrawler> Was that bleed proc?
[4:32:45] <mostundesired> It's not always gonna do that much damage, though. It's bleed.
[4:32:47] <%Order_of_Mystery> Yes
[4:32:48] <jhonxiolonn> it is a % based on hp
[4:32:49] <CappuccinoGuil> @radiocrawler That was BLEED
[4:32:49] <%doc_ock_rokc> These spells were always cool in vanillia
[4:32:50] <NiftyNox> If its Dark 1 bleed again than its percentage based, I dont think it always does 5000 damage LUL
[4:32:51] <+pectusumbra> yeah, dokapon begins soon
[4:32:59] <+Sapientiae> you should summon lion knight albert
[4:32:59] <$RealThiele> the dummy has 50k health
[4:33:02] <%BluBox> It's the evangelist spell
[4:33:02] <royb2> Black fireball and Deep barb arent exactly the same, Deep barb also has curse.
[4:33:08] <+oda_flobunaga> Actually, she'd probably start undressing him with her ears first
[4:33:09] <mostundesired> LUL
[4:33:14] <%SpicyCheeseNips> With FP Regen bleed is gonna be reeeeeally op sometimes
[4:33:16] <%saadi90> Lame

[4:33:18] <fat_burtreynolds> sbfpGou sbfpGi
[4:33:20] <Jrocy247> IT CHAINED
[4:33:20] <Valentinius_Anodyne> The dummy has an ABSURD amount of health, so bleed is big damage
[4:33:24] <arkv01> dead
[4:33:25] <+linSP> did pat find the merc ring near the first wall bonfire

[4:33:31] <@Moobot> I've been playing this game for how long? Oh only 4h 33m.
[4:33:31] <%Valdorick> Seems like a boss killer spell
[4:33:32] <mostundesired> Okay, now try it with just one dude.
[4:33:33] <$RealThiele> boss spell
[4:33:33] <%Typhaeon> That seems.... situational
[4:33:33] <%Order_of_Mystery> Gnaw is for bosses I think
[4:33:35] <whitewhiskeygamer> F
[4:33:35] <jhonxiolonn> not the enemies for it
[4:33:36] <%heartlesshealer> maybe against a single enemy
[4:33:36] <%Valdorick> rather than a trash spell
[4:33:36] <Zer0beats> GANKED
[4:33:38] <+lethallylactic> @linSP Yes
[4:33:38] <Lophostrix_> @linSP yes
[4:33:40] <Zombrocom> Gnaw is a more boss spell
[4:33:41] <fat_burtreynolds> sbfpScared
[4:33:41] <%Order_of_Mystery> Like a certain big slow fattie
[4:33:48] <%doc_ock_rokc> Gnaw on bosses Nibble on nemies
[4:33:49] <timbroome> Clang gang
[4:33:51] <%Taisuru> Doin it
[4:33:53] <Zombrocom> Bleed does percent damage so, bigger health more damage

[4:34:56] <%heartlesshealer> STOP
[4:35:02] <%masterpiecejeremy> This is what happens when you show up to gated communities looking like a hobo
[4:35:03] <%SpicyCheeseNips> Are armor guys resistant to bleed or soemthing?
[4:35:09] <royb2> you need dorhys gnaw
[4:35:12] <Shishi1205> Gnaw is better for bosses I iamgine
[4:35:13] <%Order_of_Mystery> if they have their shields up, yeah
[4:35:13] <+linSP> I think the new nibble spell is better than gnaw
[4:35:14] <%Taisuru> WOOLIVE
[4:35:15] <%heartlesshealer> okay the other guy was far away
[4:35:16] <mark_collins45> Woolie live now

[4:35:18] <huskarl_zap> WOOLIE ON TIME TO BOOK SMOrc
[4:35:19] <Jrocy247> DOKAPON TIME
[4:35:19] <jhonxiolonn> some enemies have bleed resistance
[4:35:20] <whitewhiskeygamer> Might be, and shields tend to block a good bit of bleed damage
[4:35:21] <Sundaysmiles01> depends on their resistances
[4:35:22] <%coreyyotto> Probably viable if it stacks with bleed weapons
[4:35:22] <%Laecerelius> Pat's soul isn't dark enough
[4:35:25] <henshin2289> so is this all mods or did the game get updated?
[4:35:26] <Zombrocom> You got a bleed with three hits on the dummy so they must resist bleed
[4:35:27] <%GalacticLatte> You really feel the poise in this, it's nice
[4:35:31] <+Sebenoth> “Seems like a spell for bosses” continues to use it on goons

[4:35:46] <+twohitgood> makes sense that armored guys would have some bleed resist.

[4:36:32] <koolkatdq> No fight dancer
[4:36:38] <%heartlesshealer> okay but fight for real
[4:36:43] <+lethallylactic> You can hold spells like Lightning Arrow in the base game
[4:36:43] <fat_burtreynolds> Meathook em Pat!
[4:36:44] <NiftyNox> Can you hold the spell?
[4:36:50] <NiftyNox> Thats cool
[4:36:51] <royb2> the charge thing makes a huge difference
[4:36:55] <jhonxiolonn> come on, you got it
[4:36:58] <+desfore> ...just use the big spell
[4:36:59] <+Amaideus> That'd be great for PVP
[4:37:03] <+PlagueOfGripes> why are the named npcs so smol
[4:37:05] <+linSP> Gnaw, man, gnaw
[4:37:05] <%Niney_Who> It's almost like being forced to stand completely still to cast a spell is weak
[4:37:12] <%Niney_Who> So it was fixed
[4:37:16] <Josef_Stryker> Us that an NPC invader or a real person?
[4:37:19] <Zer0beats> OHHH
[4:37:20] <%doc_ock_rokc> @PlagueOfGripes because they are adorable
[4:37:22] <Sundaysmiles01> NPC
[4:37:23] <+Amaideus> Gnaw's to bleed stuff out
[4:37:23] <%SpicyCheeseNips> cuz they are using player models
[4:37:24] <%heartlesshealer> okay but fight for real against this named enemy
[4:37:29] <olm46> Gnaw should be renamed to Hickey.
[4:37:35] <%FacetiousAF> not sure that was worth the 10k...
[4:37:36] <Radski5> Wow this seems really cool, considering Dark Edge is now NOT a 2000ms attack that deals piss damage. Hope all Hex spells are as viable.
[4:37:43] <mostundesired> Bleed builds? What's that?
[4:37:43] <jhonxiolonn> switch to your melee weapon
[4:37:44] <+twohitgood> poise boise
[4:37:47] <+PlagueOfGripes> I assume this mod also gets rid of the blue flask
[4:37:49] <+mechslayer71> How different is the mod? Just content changes, or systems and gameplay too?
[4:37:50] <whitewhiskeygamer> Big Boy, Big Poise
[4:37:57] <warmnoid> blue flask is in
[4:37:57] <Calek> @PlagueOfGripes it's still there
[4:37:58] <%Order_of_Mystery> @Radski5 they are, and there's a bunch of fun new ones!
[4:37:59] <Zombrocom> Blue flask is still around, kinda useless though
[4:37:59] <+linSP> I’d say the sediment soul arts are best because they apply curse
[4:38:00] <Shishi1205> there's still ashen estus
[4:38:00] <+Vulzi> Vulzi subscribed with Twitch Prime. 
[4:38:01] <%doc_ock_rokc> No the ash flask still exists
[4:38:01] <%Laecerelius> You can have blue flask if you want
[4:38:03] <%SpicyCheeseNips> @PlagueOfGripes no its the first item you get when you start
[4:38:04] <spoiledbadger> no the blue flask is still in it
[4:38:05] <+Kataiser> Gnaw is great if you've got a status affliction build.
[4:38:05] <%Taisuru> @PlagueOfGripes Nope, still there, just not MANDATORY
[4:38:05] <+lethallylactic> @PlagueOfGripes You still get it, but it's not really needed.
[4:38:07] <%GalacticLatte> This dude's sword is cool when you get it
[4:38:07] <Jrocy247> @Josef_Stryker NPC, this mod adds new NPCS
[4:38:08] <+PlagueOfGripes> why would it even need to be there anymore
[4:38:09] <+Amaideus> 80 on hit, 32 on block
[4:38:12] <%PrettyThickandStrongDyck> Actyually the blue flask is still there
[4:38:12] <Sundaysmiles01> that was the proc
[4:38:15] <%SpicyCheeseNips> idk
[4:38:15] <spoiledbadger> but you don't need to use it really
[4:38:20] <mobiusnightshade> At least he'll eventually either get more power with the Man-Grub's Staff or more range with the Immolation Tinder.
[4:38:20] <andiianfii> more work to remove it
[4:38:21] <%Taisuru> @PlagueOfGripes So you can refill a bunch quickly
[4:38:24] <%GalacticLatte> Use an ember before Vordt to summon Sword Master if you wish @PatStaresAt

[4:55:27] <beezushrist> @Garthunox It's not a good thing if I can tell that you composed something all the time because it sounds the same. Yes, Nobou Uematsu would be an example of a composer who has a distinct style, but all his shit does not sound the same. I can tell it is him, but it doesn't sound like his other songs. Motoi ripps songs from other games and reuses them in games or pieces of songs from other games LOL
