[0:20:01] <father_hill> codblops time
[0:20:04] <%GabeSweetMan> When referring to what just occurred on screen, direct your comments as "Past Pat" and for all predictive comments, direct them at "Future Pat".
[0:20:10] <+Slushsoup> I wish I could run Warzone on my pc
[0:20:16] <$Afterman_> i bet future pat wins a chicken dinner
[0:20:16] <%SWFanatic> Can you make Elmo play the CodBlops?
[0:20:18] <%cureneckbeard> What idiot called it stream delay and not Castle Super Late
[0:20:18] <+Order_of_Mystery> why delayed?
[0:20:18] <%Starotter70> You heard him chat, spam questions until you get an answer
[0:20:22] <%Jaxnos> yea
[0:20:23] <worldbrand> This message is for Present Pat, but he missed it

[0:20:36] <%GabeSweetMan> There is no Present Pat, he is dead.
[0:20:36] <%Kirkenburger> MP5 is the best weapon
[0:20:36] <%Kriss1827> Kriss1827 subscribed at Tier 1. They've subscribed for 5 months! 
[0:20:39] <%mistymntns> Why Riot Shield?

[0:20:43] <kylejefferies> Noob gun
[0:20:44] <@Velyndra> >not using coldblooded
[0:20:44] <%lethallunacyx> It is the best gun for newbies
[0:20:44] <Hawkbone_> M4 is gud goon
[0:20:45] <DesertPenguin> The audio is shit and that's a major point of contention
[0:20:47] <DesertPenguin> Now you know
[0:20:47] <@Velyndra> BRUH
[0:20:48] <PanicSwytch> Load out succs balls
[0:20:49] <%Mister_McDerp> the meta gun
[0:20:51] <%GabeSweetMan> Present Pat is lost to the void of time and space.
[0:20:54] <%Chimeraelite> M4 is solid. I just prefer the Tavor
[0:20:56] <worldbrand> What do you mean? He's there right n- oh he's gone.
[0:20:57] <$Dakuu75> Is this game still loud-as-all-hell when you get in the drop ship?
[0:20:57] <%dekkitout> Yum, granules
[0:20:58] <%Jaxnos> i see a pattern
[0:20:59] <%thelonechris> Does it go bang bang though?
[0:20:59] <%cureneckbeard> pat is now getting the "your loadout sucks" messages from 5 minutes ago
[0:21:05] <%mistymntns> Oh god. Please help me. I might just scream with this.
[0:21:06] <j0ustar> For anyone just arriving, Pat is on a 5 minute delay so he doesn't get streamsniped
[0:21:07] <+Slushsoup> He’s using controller?
[0:21:09] <%cureneckbeard> fun prank: answer Pat with just "yes" or "no" because he won't remmeber what he asked
[0:21:10] <%lethallunacyx> That's fine
[0:21:11] <%Kirkenburger> M4 is good too, focus on the recoil and your set
[0:21:14] <%mckraven> Chat trying to give loadout suggestions to the future
[0:21:17] <%lethallunacyx> no what?
[0:21:23] <%dekkitout> Cold-blooded
[0:21:24] <transporterthesequel> Future Pat is actually reading this as we type chat, WE are the time travelers
[0:21:28] <father_hill> never played warzone but this loadout probably sucks
[0:21:29] <kylejefferies> Pat! Accuracy is Bullet Spread and Control is Recoil.
[0:21:31] <+deedubbelyuu> double time is good
[0:21:36] <+blastazoid26> @patstaresat Are you on M&KB?
[0:21:38] <%GabeSweetMan> Here's the catch all answer chat: psaWrong
[0:21:40] <%Kirkenburger> Mp5 with the shotgun melts people too Pat
[0:21:45] <$Dakuu75> No one uses the riot shield- Pat: "I USE the riot shield"
[0:21:46] <%Starotter70> Future Pat, don't fuck your Grandma!
[0:21:49] <Solidnick18> i hope so
[0:21:50] <%SWFanatic> i hope pat loses but elmo wins
[0:21:52] <%ChaosAethr> Famous Last Words
[0:21:54] <PanicSwytch> FUTURE PAT, DOES CORONA STILL EXIST?
[0:21:55] <%Coystick> Controller or KB+M?

[0:25:10] <%ghostofsolomon> PAT DO YOU REALIZE HOW DIFFICULT WARZONE SOLOS IS?
[0:25:12] <%skelechief> Future pat, the "META" loudout for every gun is the longest barrel + merc foregrip + no stock. I prefer the monolithic suppressor. Also best gun is the GRAU but the AUG in 5.56 has the highest DPS
[0:25:13] <ergulor> You have to do better than paige
[0:25:14] <+Slushsoup> PastPatStaresAt
