[0:23:22] <dan_g_v> was that the Sea Breeze or Zangief is sleeping on the side?
[0:23:24] <%MistyMntns> And then come runing to the Geek Squad to fix it.
[0:23:26] <%heartlesshealer> touch something metal before touching anything on the inside of your computer
[0:23:27] <Profmcstevie> Look at this expensive fragile equipment that needs varying amounts of elbow grease
[0:23:29] <+shaybcakes> when I built my PC I installed the GPU upside down
[0:23:30] <%czeekytv> literally just leave the psu plugged in and touch the case every once in a while

[0:27:05] <PartyFavors> I just finished my Final Cut run earlier today. Good time.

[0:27:17] <+Jiggisnipe> or better
[0:27:20] <%hax_metatron> Also alternative paths
[0:27:23] <%Alazull> Sometimes BG3 does do that, but not often enough
[0:27:23] <%hax_metatron> That don't open up otherwise
[0:27:25] <%BigCoffee> But that awful version is funny!
[0:27:25] <TasenElite> "Let us make fuck"
[0:27:26] <Tisaric> I fucking love there's a fail state in Disco where your character just gives up from failing over and over

[0:27:29] <+glgzephyr> I mean, they still have time to do that LUL
[0:27:30] <%Blackleafx> Pat, I really like how Fallout does it as well if you fail a check
[0:27:31] <hippofant> That empathy check though.

[0:27:45] <$Futurecity10> I'll be honest I think Baldurs gate 3 might suck
[0:27:46] <TheGesticulator> There are certain checks in Disco Elysium that I much preferred to fail. If that's not the sign of a good game I don't know what is.
[0:27:47] <sirtommygunn> glad you fucked up hitting the child
[0:27:52] <%Pappajimbo> yeah bg3 should have a roll 1 fuckup option
[0:27:57] <+glgzephyr> Nah don't spoil that game

[0:28:29] <Phil_Morg> sadly theres one point in Disco that they give you a check that you NEED to complete otherwise you wont be able to proceed in the game. I managed to softlock myself by failing the check multiple times and running out of levels to retry the check later. I hope the new Final Cut fixed this issue.

[0:29:06] <+shaidot> Didya see that MMA fight
[0:29:07] <Vyskus> honestly the ring finger is kinda useless
[0:29:08] <laserbeaming> you need your pinky
[0:29:08] <%torusendor> Pinky is the worst one
[0:29:09] <Jontman42> no pinky is important for grip
[0:29:10] <thelonechris> Pinky is still important
[0:29:13] <laserbeaming> to hold stuff
[0:29:14] <+glgzephyr> nah the pinky is useful for masturbation
[0:29:14] <Dr_Mooose> your pinky is important
[0:29:15] <%hax_metatron> Pinky finger is weak
[0:29:16] <RetributionP> we need workers rights
[0:29:17] <%Alazull> Can't hold a sword or a knife as well
[0:29:17] <terrorengine> do they get to choose which finger?
[0:29:17] <%Undenizen> apparently the pinkie affects your grip WAY more than you'd expect
[0:29:17] <+shaidot> Dude got his finger ripped off in a fight

[0:29:21] <%Ranryu692> didn't an MMA fighter lose a finger last week, and they had to get the audience to help look for it?
[0:29:21] <%bassoontyphoon> Man that reminds me of those horrific Canadian PSAs
[0:29:24] <%AzureGale> That pinky is SUPER important if you're a violin player
[0:29:24] <RetributionP> that is deplorable
[0:29:25] <%Piemen99> NO
[0:29:26] <Jontman42> the ring finger is the actual most useless finger
[0:29:27] <+twohitgood> I need my pinky for playing guitar.
[0:29:28] <sirtommygunn> what the fuck
[0:29:30] <%Agami23> no pat, you cant grip stuff without your pinkey

[0:31:33] <%twoto858> FF14
[0:31:33] <%Ranryu692> more games should have that warning
[0:31:33] <%czeekytv> Is the longest one the ARR one? You know which one lol
[0:31:34] <T_Sasquatch> Its basically , sit down motherfucker
[0:31:36] <%caramelatte1> Usually the conclusion
[0:31:36] <$RealThiele> that warning is pretty great
[0:31:41] <Profmcstevie> *buckle up fucko* warning
[0:31:43] <penitentpendant> "Welcome to a Metal Gear subsection."
[0:31:44] <%torusendor> Two hours?
[0:31:48] <%AzureGale> A series of cutscenes will play in a series
[0:31:49] <+ReallyBigRocks> And then the developer takes a big plot dump right on your face
[0:31:49] <+glgzephyr> yeah that one has a ton of shit
[0:31:50] <$RealThiele> thirsty
[0:31:53] <@SoFarFetched> ooooo that geefGasp that was such a thing
[0:31:58] <@SoFarFetched> When I got to that part.
[0:32:03] <%Undenizen> I honestly hate when games give you 30minute + cutscenes.
[0:32:04] <+glgzephyr> that was the moment where FFXIV sold me
[0:32:05] <Zeif00> Am I bad for skipping cutscenes to catch up to my friends?
[0:32:10] <syzmachine> all games are infinitely better when played on the donkey Konga bongo drums
[0:32:14] <T_Sasquatch> I also love the "This is the final level of the game are you sure you want to continue"
[0:32:22] <@SoFarFetched> @Zeif00 You'll be VERY confused on the story.
[0:32:25] <+sumrand0> Nintendo pro controller still sucks IMO it feels like a 3rd party controller but thats just me any my non baby hands (Nintendo pro controller buttons r still tiny)
[0:32:29] <%czeekytv> @Zeif00 you'll be missing out but you do you I guess
[0:32:31] <%TheGreatSkenardo> I am unable to take any conversation seriously when there's the leathery foghorn of your doggo snoring in the background
[0:32:35] <%KishinGrek> that's insane
[0:32:35] <penitentpendant> @Zeif00 You CAN replay them in your room. You SHOULD watch any that had that prompt.
[0:32:38] <%LeiaSkynoober> 2.5 is SO GOOD
[0:32:39] <DianaTheAscian> @PatStaresAt are you gonna stream 5.5 msq btw?
[0:32:39] <+OmegaWeltall> yea HW was great, stormblood was trash-+
[0:32:40] <%Alazull> @Zeif00 Watch them afterwards otherwise you're missing out on one of the good parts of the game--story
[0:32:41] <%DakotaMacDoodle> The good
[0:32:49] <+rocketaku> and then they spoil it in the heavensward trailer
[0:32:51] <blackskulldragon18> OK
[0:32:55] <T_Sasquatch> @Zeif00 if you skip cutscenes your enjoyment of the game will eventually wittle down and you wont care
[0:32:58] <@SoFarFetched> Also Im sure your friends would be okay with you enjoying the cutscenes,they want YOU to experience the game and why THEY like it.
[0:32:59] <%Undenizen> I never skip but PACING IS A THING THAT EXISTS
[0:32:59] <+glgzephyr> if you're skipping cutscenes, why even play the game
[0:33:04] <%caramelatte1> Else how will you get HYPED for that recent trailer
[0:33:08] <+egalitarian696969> go play another game why are you playing an mmo if you're gonna skip
[0:33:13] <sirtommygunn> I like FF14 but I just can't stick with it, and my one mmo friend refuses to play it
[0:33:13] <T_Sasquatch> i cant imagine putting 100s of hours into this game and skipping cutscenes
[0:33:15] <LorcaNomad> heavensward trailer has so many spoilers though
[0:33:17] <$RealThiele> NG+ stream?
[0:33:25] <%czeekytv> To be honest, I skipped some of the Stormblood cutscenes (especially the Xaela shit, god that was boring)
[0:33:32] <RetributionP> imagine having the mindset of skipping ff14 cutscenes
[0:33:41] <COMB711> Ok look I was really mad about going to the waking sands and talking to minfilia I skipped some cutscenes ok
[0:33:55] <penitentpendant> "You're building a book case for my son? I'LL KILL YOU!"
[0:33:56] <+rocketaku> the xaela stuff was the best part. you're nuts
[0:34:05] <skyentombment> Hey Pat, where dog?
[0:34:06] <T_Sasquatch> i wont pretend, some dialogue sections in ffxiv are complete ass and i skim read alot of it but when its cutscene time its never bad
[0:34:10] <%AzureGale> Let's get some wood. Time to head to a male strip club
[0:34:13] <%Daxalog> Nothing in FF14 has that though. Atleast earrly on.  Christ its boringg
[0:34:13] <+Mendin> Here's the thing about FFXIV - It's a Final Fantasy JRPG that happens to be an MMO, you watch JRPG cutscenes because that's the  PLOT
[0:34:15] <Profmcstevie> "Kill 10 slimes, have some exp" is garbage, "kill 10 slimes cos these filthy creatures took my dad from me" is a little better
[0:34:16] <$RealThiele> grindddd
[0:34:21] <tdmb29> imagine not skipping cutscenes
[0:34:22] <%LeiaSkynoober> I sometimes skip cutscenes when my duty finder pops
[0:34:37] <$RealThiele> WoW pissed you off
[0:34:44] <sirtommygunn> it needs to motivate you
[0:35:00] <%AzureGale> Fizing
[0:35:03] <DianaTheAscian> I know someone who is skipping every cutscenes/ mashing through dialog "cause to much reading" hes in post stromblood and is mad he doesn't get the plot now @PatStaresAt
[0:35:04] <echobee_tv> good evening!
[0:35:07] <tdmb29> Big number though
[0:35:08] <T_Sasquatch> BRUH
[0:35:09] <%SharkMissile> @PatStaresAt I'm in Stormblood now and I just...don't care about the main plot.
[0:35:10] <T_Sasquatch> I WAS SO HYPE
[0:35:27] <%czeekytv> Stormblood sucks in some parts, more than ARR
[0:35:28] <RetributionP> THAT BOSS WAS SO GOOD
[0:35:33] <%DakotaMacDoodle> Yeah I think thats why 14 did not click for me the first time i tried it. I was skipping to get past the base game. due to bad advice from someone I'm really digging it now tho.
[0:35:34] <%Fenrisulfr_V> Fenrisulfr_V subscribed with Prime. They've subscribed for 3 months! I still don't know how to feel getting hit with the "Moralist Sorry Cop" by this game.
[0:35:35] <+glgzephyr> this is a very good explanation of this topic
[0:35:37] <+glgzephyr> clip this
[0:35:37] <%Bluwizard21> @PatStaresAt Is urugaan in rise? I'm 5 stars in and I'd really like the urugaan armor
[0:35:39] <$RealThiele> the end part with the bird got me i cried
[0:35:40] <%Agami23> yeaaah
[0:35:49] <echobee_tv> !uptime
[0:35:49] <%GarbageQueenEllie> I remember the first time I tried to play WoW, I was like 10, and I wanted to buy a linen shirt and it cost like a billion golds, I was like "Fuck this I'm out"
[0:35:49] <@Moobot> I've been playing this game for how long? Oh only 36m 9s.
[0:35:50] <%Mendin> @SharkMissile Stormblood is kinda weak on t hat bit, admittedly. Watch the Azim Steppe stuff and the post-4.0 stuff especially
[0:35:54] <inksmears> BIG AGREE
[0:35:55] <@SoFarFetched> yeah you won't experience it the same.
[0:36:04] <tdmb29> but get big number quicker
[0:36:05] <T_Sasquatch> the amount of hype at the end of shadowbringers is insane
[0:36:15] <%Agami23> YEAH
[0:36:16] <%cvp5127> when does the plot get good?
[0:36:18] <Profmcstevie> You need context to appreciate WHY this is happening
[0:36:20] <%torusendor> They needed to go NOW
[0:36:22] <T_Sasquatch> bout to smack thordan ASS
[0:36:22] <+sumrand0> I liked Adios but does that game even have a fail state? (aka a way to "lose") If you can't lose & progression is based on conversations WHY IS CALLED A GAME. its a fantastic narrative in digital format but what is the "game" in adios?
[0:36:25] <+rocketaku> You're paying monthly for a game with a heavy story-filled experience and you're skipping out on it. You're literally wasting your money.
[0:36:27] <%Agami23> mother fuckers need to GO
[0:36:27] <DexteraXIII> *Sassy Hand Wave*
[0:36:28] <%Alazull> "I WILL RIP HIS STILL BEATING HEART OUT OF HIS CHEST AND SHOW IT TO HIM FOR WHAT HE HAS DONE!"
[0:36:29] <%Mendin> A smile
[0:36:32] <%holydeviant1> I tank mained and Moogle King scared me away
[0:36:32] <+glgzephyr> that's pretty accurate
[0:36:32] <sirtommygunn> but that takes time, effort, and good writing, why bother when I can just make a joke about how this is yet another quest to get 10 bear asses
[0:36:33] <%MisterRockett> *furiously trying to remember that shit in the vault*
[0:36:34] <%SharkMissile> Post Titan :p
[0:36:35] <%holydeviant1> was I a fool?
[0:36:36] <$metzselaar> After titan
[0:36:40] <%Monkeyweed21> THAT FUCKING MOVE IN THORDAN EX
[0:36:45] <penitentpendant> "Why are you sad? The Witch of Doma will soon be dead."
[0:36:45] <T_Sasquatch> It unironically gets good 20 hours later LUL
[0:36:48] <inksmears> people in my static skip the entire story each expansion and patch and i judge them so hard for it tbh. like what are you PAYING for then?!?!
[0:36:49] <Lmsd944> Paying for content then skipping is mental to me
[0:36:50] <%Alazull> Haurchefant happened in Vaults
[0:36:51] <+vaderxyz1970> I skipped through Stormblood
[0:36:52] <%SharkMissile> Haha yass :Y
[0:36:54] <DianaTheAscian> @PatStaresAt stormblood is fine
[0:36:55] <%VioletHeart> Stormblood's actual content is good, I think, but it suffers from terrible pacing.
[0:36:56] <%Daxalog> So skip till lvl 40 got it
[0:36:58] <%Agami23> titan is the worst part of final fantasy 14
[0:36:58] <%Monkeyweed21> THEY PUT THAT ONE ATTACK IN THORDAN EX
[0:36:59] <+glgzephyr> And also quite early iirc
[0:37:00] <Phil_Morg> Pat I'm not sure how far you are into Disco, but a warning:  There's a Shivers check halfway through that REQUIRES you to pass it in order to continue through the game, you can only retry it if you complete a sidequest or acquire new levels, and theres only a limited amount of those, so be careful about saving or you might get softlocked later on.
[0:37:04] <BiologicGases> i think im gonna stop watching when youre done talking since i am playing disco elysium on my own
[0:37:05] <%cvp5127> got it
[0:37:05] <T_Sasquatch> YES ! Titan is when I started loving the game
[0:37:08] <%Quigsies> Stormblood is better than ARR at least
[0:37:12] <$RealThiele> AAAAA YAH
[0:37:16] <%spitelite> yeah but the steppe is cool
[0:37:16] <%Alazull> @PatStaresAt Is that because Titan feels like a filler arc?
[0:37:16] <%Agami23> i'd say half of stormblood is fine
[0:37:17] <%twoto858> I'm working on the 2.0 patches right now, and man I feel overwhelmed with all the stuff
[0:37:20] <+Allymac96> ARR post patch content is a slog
[0:37:20] <%SharkMissile> Heavensward made me cry for real. :(
[0:37:24] <Sol_Install> !uptime
[0:37:24] <@Moobot> I've been playing this game for how long? Oh only 37m 44s.
[0:37:25] <%czeekytv> I retroactively enjoy ARR more than Stormblood now because of the added context in Shadowbringers
[0:37:26] <%Agami23> i dont care for ghr arbania
[0:37:31] <$Futurecity10> Stormbloods not even better than ARR
[0:37:33] <Sol_Install> @PatStaresAt hows your chest btw?
[0:37:33] <RetributionP> stormblood is more of an adventure then a central goal driven thingy
[0:37:35] <Oxybe> Ah yes. i turn in to a silent pat and a snoring geif.
[0:37:38] <KaiserMario> @PatStaresAt This is a strange problem, but the non voiced dialogue is a big turn off for me, would I still enjoy the story regardless?
[0:37:40] <%walternatorz> titan is literally a beach episode
[0:37:44] <$Futurecity10> Zenos is the worst thing to happen to ff14
[0:37:47] <%Nobrev> I've actually started going through the whole story again in the NG+ mode in preparation for Endwalker
[0:37:48] <DexteraXIII> They should have split Gyr Abania and Doma into two patches
[0:37:48] <%Monkeyweed21> man that cheese and wine shit is the worst part of the game
[0:37:50] <T_Sasquatch> @twoto858 its about the journey, seriously dont even thinik about the future just focus on the now
[0:37:50] <LorcaNomad> If you don't care about Xenoblade 2's story because bad voice direction you are robbing yourself of one of the best JRPG stories of the last decade
[0:37:54] <DianaTheAscian> @PatStaresAt so do u plan to stream 5.5 msq?
[0:38:00] <RetributionP> zenos is cool and I love him
[0:38:02] <+glgzephyr> why not stream msq?
[0:38:02] <@SoFarFetched> yeah I'd have to not be here for EndBringers.
[0:38:02] <$RealThiele> NG+!
[0:38:11] <penitentpendant> Stream the reactions for the 5.5 Automata raid
[0:38:11] <@SoFarFetched> cause Im still in HW
[0:38:12] <Psyramics> do the nier raid and the weapon series and that's it
[0:38:12] <%Mendin> You'd better stream that raid
[0:38:14] <%Alazull> Do Endwalkers?
[0:38:16] <sirtommygunn> plan an event ahead of time
[0:38:17] <DianaTheAscian> aww
[0:38:18] <%Mendin> We gotta see the end of Yoko Taro's Wild Ride
[0:38:19] <Vyskus> I'mma be real, the streaming culture for ffxiv seems to really suck
[0:38:20] <%czeekytv> MMO's are hard to stream :(
[0:38:24] <%Quigsies> 6.0 streams?
[0:38:24] <+Dova573> awwww
[0:38:29] <inksmears> it's only part 1 of 5.5 tho
[0:38:31] <%torusendor> Beat up to 5.55 or get fucked
[0:38:33] <+glgzephyr> I thought it was implied that people who don't know shouldn't watch FFXIV streams
[0:38:38] <tdmb29> mmos don't stream well
[0:38:41] <DexteraXIII> Say you're going to stream it, then stream Blitzball instead
[0:38:50] <penitentpendant> I enjoyed the stream, but I can understand it didn't pull in the views
[0:38:52] <%VioletHeart> And it was a great 10 days of streams, even if the views were garbage.
[0:38:52] <LorcaNomad> it was many streams
[0:38:55] <+glgzephyr> I remember seeing the numbers on that tank
[0:38:58] <+sumrand0> yeah
[0:38:59] <%AzureGale> F
[0:39:00] <%KingofTwitchTV> KingofTwitchTV subscribed with Prime. They've subscribed for 7 months! hallo love the dog noise
[0:39:03] <$metzselaar> I would watch you as I did shadowbringers (why I started to play it), but I get why if you dont.
[0:39:03] <%GarbageQueenEllie> lol did you hear about Apex Legends banning the Secret Joestar Technique
[0:39:07] <Psyramics> yeeah, I wanna play it for myself
[0:39:07] <sirtommygunn> just go touring around the zones talking about your favorite moments
[0:39:12] <RetributionP> I went back and watched all of those streams pat
[0:39:13] <+rocketaku> I think its a bad idea, pat. Everyone who cares about it will also be playing it.
[0:39:14] <%MisterRockett> I watched it all on vods after I finished playing it.
[0:39:16] <+OmegaWeltall> oh i dont watch 14 streams cause i dont care about 14 anymore
[0:39:17] <RetributionP> after
[0:39:19] <+Jiggisnipe> lol
[0:39:19] <%radregice> LUL
[0:39:20] <%czeekytv> Did you have fun doing it tho
[0:39:20] <+glgzephyr> you did this to yourself LUL
[0:39:21] <inksmears> yeah i can't watch ff14 streams because i am playing it myself LUL
[0:39:22] <$RealThiele> oof
[0:39:24] <%Alazull> @PatStaresAt Stream up to the first dungeon? Then do it on your own and if people like it they can play it?
[0:39:24] <thunka10> oof
[0:39:25] <%VioletHeart> That's kinda bittersweet though, I think.
[0:39:25] <DianaTheAscian> @PatStaresAt those streams did get me in though
[0:39:26] <%czeekytv> More fun than playing it by yourself
[0:39:30] <+Jiggisnipe> good job
[0:39:33] <%MisterRockett> Do vod numbers count for something?
[0:39:33] <LorcaNomad> the classic

[0:39:36] <%walternatorz> always the influencer, never the influencee
[0:39:37] <%luftraumm1> that's a choice on getting in on the community, jesse Cox got a whole lot of ppl in those streams
[0:39:37] <thunka10> who's that snoring?
[0:39:40] <Vyskus> yeah the people that care are too busy getting through it themselves LUL
[0:39:40] <$RealThiele> Isn't Paige going to play (you guys made that deal right)?
[0:39:40] <Bearheart223> Watching your Shadowbringers playthrough wall to wall made me buy the game, and i loved it ever since, even though i spoiled the entire expac watching your streams
[0:39:41] <A0N33> Yeah that's exactly the problem with me, I wanna watch you stream FF14 but not the MSQ
[0:39:42] <penitentpendant> 34k views on Youtube
[0:39:43] <+glgzephyr> that's exactly the reason I can't watch you, I'm in the middle of ShB LUL
[0:39:45] <penitentpendant> So... eh
[0:39:46] <tdmb29> zzzzzzzzzzz
[0:39:46] <+wmeldrum> tbh mmos are kinda hard to watch
[0:39:49] <$RealThiele> Have her stream the MSQ
[0:39:54] <%RetroCop87> nier stuff stream
[0:39:54] <%sashagreenspiderqueen> as someone who loves the streams, plays 14, and enjoys seeing 14 streamed definitely play it off stream and do highlight stuff like craft leveling podcast-tier stream
[0:39:56] <penitentpendant> That's fair
[0:39:59] <%rumtumtugnutz> I played it in the background while I played Shadowbringers.
[0:40:00] <+sumrand0> Pat chat gives dumb suggestions, can't trust em. NOT EVEN ME!
[0:40:04] <%Nobrev> @PatStaresAt it's hard because I 100% want to watch you play the new ff14 content but I also want to play it myself without spoilers and also don't want you to have to wait a few days to give people time to play it
[0:40:10] <%luftraumm1> I did ShB along with you and watched everything
[0:40:11] <%JamesCorck> psaDogchamp *snore snore <3 snore snore <3*
[0:40:12] <Clundy> 24 hr launch day stream LUL
[0:40:15] <%maenos2> mmos aren't really all that engaging to me to be honest
[0:40:16] <%Valdorick> New Game+ Stream
[0:40:20] <tdmb29> oddworld stream? free on ps plus
[0:40:22] <%caramelatte1> Co stream with Jessie coxs? :P
[0:40:22] <Vyskus> Stream leveling an alt lmao
[0:40:30] <%Daxalog> Jesse cox is a lore guy tho
[0:40:35] <%Livelinne> psaDogchamp psaDogchamp psaDogchamp
[0:40:36] <+glgzephyr> HEAR HEAR
[0:40:39] <%sashagreenspiderqueen> @PatStaresAt that said like i still go back and reference your crafter leveling tutorial stream
[0:40:40] <%SharkMissile> THANKYOU
[0:40:41] <%Alazull> Why would you play an alt?
[0:40:41] <%torusendor> Alts suck in XIV
[0:40:46] <T_Sasquatch> YES !
[0:40:47] <$metzselaar> It takes a special kind of person to jump in a watch you from your point. I was bouncing off Guild Wars 2 when I watched you durning 5.0
[0:40:48] <%radregice> agree
[0:40:49] <%caramelatte1> Alts are pointless
[0:40:49] <%Mendin> When's Paige's playthrough
[0:40:49] <+vaderxyz1970> Now do it again
[0:40:51] <+ALazo> NG+?
[0:40:52] <$Futurecity10> people level alts for maps
[0:40:52] <LorcaNomad> actually fuck alts
[0:40:54] <%RetroCop87> you'd get more views if you dressed Zangief like a moogle
[0:40:55] <RetributionP> make Paige play and stream it
[0:40:56] <%Alazull> Literally one of the selling points of the game is not needing them
[0:40:58] <%SilvaChariot0133> it's only really if you are trying to get around lockouts
[0:40:59] <Dragovus> @PatStaresAt You could do an alt and go through the entire thing with Paige
[0:41:02] <blaccbird914> blaccbird914 subscribed with Prime. They've subscribed for 32 months! 
[0:41:02] <Psyramics> you play an alt to be on another DC with your friends who joined late
[0:41:03] <+glgzephyr> like, FFXIV SPECIFICALLY has QoL stuff that makes alts obsolete
[0:41:03] <penitentpendant> It's true! I AM crazy! I leveled an alt JUST so I don't have Crystal Tower in my Alliance Roulette!
[0:41:03] <%AzureGale> Can't you access everything on one character
[0:41:04] <+terry_quest> just NG+ it LUL
[0:41:06] <Vyskus> agreed, fc is full of poeple with like four alts and it's mind boggling
[0:41:26] <%Monkeyweed21> stream the extremes and savages
[0:41:32] <%BallerSwagBro9k> YEYEYEYEYEYE
[0:41:34] <%Blackleafx> Ham Sandwich Race
[0:41:34] <%Fenrisulfr_V> I made an alt solely because friends bought me an ARR story/level skip on my first character, and I wanted to properly experience the base game afterwards.
[0:41:40] <+glgzephyr> Bleetzboll.
[0:41:45] <Vyskus> jesus, measurehead is a trip
[0:41:46] <laserbeaming> Woolie will totally internalize Advanced Race Theory
[0:41:47] <%AzureGale> The only reason I can see someone having alts in FFXIV is if you want characters of different races and genders
[0:41:48] <penitentpendant> @AzureGale You can. And most classes share gear so you can NG+ them when you hit cap, essentially
[0:41:53] <%radregice> bloodborne kart >>>>

[0:42:20] <RetributionP> ps1 bloodborne kart
[0:42:21] <KaiserMario> 2?
[0:42:21] <sirtommygunn> from good to less good?
[0:42:22] <DianaTheAscian> @PatStaresAt ds2?
[0:42:22] <%dork_doggler> Straight up no 2 huh
[0:42:26] <%walternatorz> get dunked on 2
[0:42:26] <aeonicvector> no 2 LUL
[0:42:27] <%Allymac96> Dark souls 2?
[0:42:27] <%radregice> poor 2 doesnt get a mention
[0:42:28] <vapidq> LOL
[0:42:29] <penitentpendant> Yeah, it's a shame the lack of build variety in Sekiro
[0:42:30] <tdmb29> blinking cop incoming
[0:42:33] <%radregice> LUL
[0:42:33] <TasenElite> Doesn't even count
[0:42:33] <+Gespens> Sekiro is a TEnchu tho
[0:42:34] <Jontman42> uh huh
[0:42:35] <T_Sasquatch> i just dont like ds3 man , I literally would rather play 2 even if 3 is technically better by almost every other margin
[0:42:37] <%cvp5127> LUL
[0:42:37] <%Bluwizard21> @PatStaresAt 2 DLC is amazing
[0:42:38] <+ALazo> There's a 2?
[0:42:38] <laserbeaming> I rather play 2 than Sekiro though
[0:42:39] <%AzureGale> LUL
[0:42:40] <%TallPixels> so from worst to best?
[0:42:43] <%Maids4lyfe> LUL
[0:42:43] <Vyskus> @Vyskus I don't really get RP either but that's just personal difference lol
[0:42:44] <Oxybe> DS2 with the big snub
[0:42:49] <%facto905> psaWrong
[0:42:50] <%walternatorz> Dark Souls 2 sucked so bad, Pat forgot to count.
[0:42:50] <bettysharkface> Oh man I almost didn't make it in time cause of the dang daylight saving time.
[0:42:51] <DianaTheAscian> @PatStaresAt do u count scholar and og 2 as different things?
[0:42:55] <%radregice> my dad works at from soft and he said elden ring is secretly the best one
[0:42:56] <Ravioli_Ronin> It’s a shame they couldn’t make 2 a good game
[0:43:00] <+sumrand0> REPRESSION isn't forgetting Pat
[0:43:12] <%Fenrisulfr_V> Dark Souls 2 is absolutely my favorite still. Liked it when it first came out, like it now.
[0:43:13] <+sumrand0> lol
[0:43:18] <+glgzephyr> Did you play Scholar?
[0:43:21] <KaiserMario> @PatStaresAt Do you enjoy Sekiro more than DS2?
[0:43:21] <Clundy> My dad works at Elden Ring and he says the game doesn’t exist
[0:43:24] <%czeekytv> SCH is fine
[0:43:34] <%BallerSwagBro9k> Scholar fixes A LOT
[0:43:34] <+Riecharus> The NG plus stuff being actually different was neat, could use more of that.
[0:43:36] <user_naim> 2 is a good but flawed game. LIKE THEY ALL ARE
[0:43:37] <%Nobrev> SotFS is bad
[0:43:37] <Devbob98> Imagine being relaxed anymore, I’m stressed 24/7
[0:43:38] <%Ranryu692> hashtag The Scholar Cut
[0:43:42] <%czeekytv> SCH could be a lot better but the last adjustment doesn't make any sense
[0:43:45] <tdmb29> dark souls 2 is the blue pill of the pills
[0:43:46] <%BallerSwagBro9k> except hitboxes
[0:43:49] <%caramelatte1> SCH's late game abilities are pretty redundant
[0:43:53] <%Fenrisulfr_V> Scholar is absolutely worse than vanilla DS2.
[0:43:57] <Ravioli_Ronin> There are parts I like about 2, but in the end it feels like a souls game made people who didn’t quite understand souls
[0:44:05] <+snausages_> Who is trashtalking scholar
[0:44:09] <inksmears> ppl thinking he meant schoalr the ff14 job LUL
[0:44:16] <$RealThiele> money sez no
[0:44:24] <%Blackleafx> Zork stream was eaten by a Grue
[0:44:29] <%Valdorick> You're eaten by a gruu.
[0:44:30] <+D00msDayDan> fuckin zork
[0:44:35] <tetrabrick1lt> LUL
[0:44:38] <+mikesapartment> Manafold garden is boring af man
[0:44:39] <laserbeaming> WotC hasn't done anything with the Planescape setting in years, and if they do they'll clean it up and make it lame
[0:44:42] <Tisaric> manifold garden kicks ass
[0:44:43] <thelonechris> Zork? More like Dork
[0:44:47] <tdmb29> bad game
[0:44:47] <T_Sasquatch> its a cool puzzle game
[0:44:51] <%VHGS> kind of!
[0:44:53] <+glgzephyr> I mean, that's not a BAD thing
[0:44:54] <Blank9> it's very pretty
[0:44:56] <%hax_metatron> It's great shut up chat
[0:44:56] <Tisaric> it's antichamber on crack
[0:44:56] <%radregice> it does have graphics tho
[0:44:59] <%sashagreenspiderqueen> oh i liked that one
[0:45:03] <%hax_metatron> Manifold Garden is awesome
[0:45:04] <%dalmek> I mean, the inspiration is pretty obvious
[0:45:06] <%sashagreenspiderqueen> it was very antichamber
[0:45:09] <$RealThiele> zork would be stream poison
[0:45:09] <%AyotoCorp> Manifold Garden's fairly short
[0:45:14] <+mikesapartment> It's antichamber with resident sleeper puzzles
[0:45:14] <%mads_valentine> mads_valentine subscribed at Tier 2. 
[0:45:14] <%AyotoCorp> You could finish it in one stream
[0:45:24] <+twohitgood> I remember anti-chamber.
[0:45:30] <sirtommygunn> Definitely similar vibes but I prefer Antichamber
[0:45:36] <TasenElite> Outriders is against people playing Outriders
[0:45:39] <%Ranryu692> that sucks
[0:45:43] <+glgzephyr> the crashes have gotten MUCH better for me
[0:46:01] <penitentpendant> "Live Service" = "Will launch in a Beta/Alpha State"
[0:46:01] <user_naim> UnderTheMayo vindicated
[0:46:02] <%SirGO0SE> liquid cooling is a trap
[0:46:06] <+possumwalsh1221> Outriders is fun when it actually works LUL
[0:46:07] <%TallPixels> why did outriders get so popular so fast?
[0:46:09] <+snausages_> I would never do water cooling
[0:46:11] <%BallerSwagBro9k> I mean it will get patched
[0:46:16] <JustYudha> Why not AIO?
[0:46:19] <%Undenizen> Fans are fine.
[0:46:26] <%valriot> liquid is fuckin sus
[0:46:26] <%SirGO0SE> i liquid cooled for years and god its so much better on the other side
[0:46:29] <%Nobrev> replace your cooling liquid with vodka
[0:46:30] <Zeif00> Liquid PeeC
[0:46:31] <tdmb29> liquid cooling is the DS2 of cooling
[0:46:31] <+snausages_> All in one I think
[0:46:33] <%abelincoln_catpuncher> LUL LUL
[0:46:35] <T_Sasquatch> building a pc is just like legos : says LIARS
[0:46:39] <%Fenrisulfr_V> Liquid cooling scares me.
[0:46:39] <%SirGO0SE> too much maintenance
[0:46:39] <Devbob98> Fans are easier to fix for me
[0:46:40] <+D00msDayDan> @TallPixels a big marketing push and probably being fun
[0:46:40] <JustYudha> All in One liquid cooler lol
[0:46:41] <primaryfire> all-in-one liquid cooling
[0:46:42] <laserbeaming> Solution: Watercool your whole basement instead
[0:46:44] <%MistyMntns> All in one. It is a Liquid Coller
[0:46:45] <+vaderxyz1970> AIO sealed liquid cooling unit
[0:46:48] <%Valdorick> Just build entire PC into Fish Tank
[0:46:48] <%MelBrooksKA> All in one liquid cooler
[0:46:49] <$Futurecity10> pc builders are the Vegans of pc gaming
[0:46:49] <%TheMattman1313> Most of the time liquid cooling isn't worth it if you have a case with enough airflow/fans.
[0:46:53] <sirtommygunn> My PC CPU always says its hot as fuck but it never has any issues
[0:46:59] <tetrabrick1lt> LUL

[0:48:45] <Phil_Morg> the softlock problem is still there?
[0:48:46] <%Mendin> Yeah if the game autosaves every 30min, you want to manual save on the 15min just in case, there's a few occasional crash or freeze bugs even on PC

[1:14:57] <SomeAsianDood> shoot down just required asking kim and good hand eye coordination
[1:15:03] <+Fenrisulfr_V> I decided against shooting it down and instead got Measurehead to do it on Day 2.
[1:15:09] <%GarbageQueenEllie> @aiutare47 Probably soon. The full voiceover thing is really appealing. May go for a punchguy cop
[1:15:12] <SomeAsianDood> @ravioli_ronin absolutely
[1:15:13] <sirtommygunn> same
[1:15:14] <naoi0> @Ravioli_Ronin There's a bad end if you succeed on shooting one of the kids
[1:15:16] <Broken_Sonex> Kenshi killed Woolie Hulk Doll
[1:15:19] <+VoytekBus> Kenshi tips with bible verses
[1:15:22] <%AzureGale> Kenshi steals the next order the restaurant worker calls
[1:15:25] <aiutare47> God I hope pat gets and miraculously passes the shoot check its one of the BEST in the game
[1:15:31] <nomos42> seems like patch is delayed? not sure
[1:15:32] <%Monkeyweed21> @SomeAsianDood his hand eye coordination is also bad
[1:15:33] <%Nobrev> it's been 10,000 years pat
[1:15:33] <cherrycottontail> guys, kenshin is an anime character, kenshi is the game
[1:15:34] <%xMaSterKeef420bluntNinjAx> @PatStaresAt It may be G-Sync related
[1:15:40] <aiutare47> @GarbageQueenEllie No spoils but do the autopsy
[1:15:40] <penitentpendant> @aiutare47 Aces Low!
[1:15:42] <Broken_Sonex> Kenshi never takes your calls
[1:15:42] <sirtommygunn> kill Chrome
[1:15:46] <Khester824> I bought kenshi after pat stream and it’s great!
[1:15:48] <Aydarkzero> whats been going onm?
[1:15:51] <+ThomasOfTroy> Do you have Chrome's hardware acceleration turned on?
[1:15:57] <%GarbageQueenEllie> @aiutare47 Oh yeah, for sure this time around
[1:15:59] <SomeAsianDood> @monkeyweed21 well I never said it was likely LUL
[1:16:01] <sirtommygunn> to kim's car
[1:16:01] <+glgzephyr> >using Chrome in 2021
[1:16:04] <%AzureGale> Kenshi wears socks with sandals
[1:16:05] <%RyanGelatin> maybe hdmi cable slash port is fucked up
[1:16:08] <aiutare47> @penitentpendant That and the secret one during the autopsy, geting the kids to shut up feels SO GOOD
[1:16:10] <+Fenrisulfr_V> Pat, please take medicine.
[1:16:17] <thelonechris> Kenshi poisoned our water supply, burned our crops, and delivered a plague onto our houses!
[1:16:18] <%Fenrisulfr_V> You're literally one bad check from death.
[1:16:20] <RetributionP> I bet downloading more ram would fix this
[1:16:22] <Ravioli_Ronin> Kenshi chugs mayonnaise
[1:16:30] <sirtommygunn> its fine he's about to sleep
[1:16:34] <%Blackleafx> @Fenrisulfr_V he can heal the moment he take damage
[1:16:35] <huskarl_zap> is this the Dishonored universe?
[1:16:38] <laserbeaming> this is a sweet moment
[1:16:41] <%Blackleafx> the game offers you a grace period of like 12 seconds
[1:16:45] <cardamomo88> sell evidence?
[1:16:50] <%Blackleafx> @huskarl_zap no its weird france
[1:16:53] <Broken_Sonex> Kenshi takes the ham out a sandwich because it just wants the ham
[1:16:56] <%Mendin> NOT KIM'S SPINNAZ
[1:16:56] <%RyanGelatin> @huskarl_zap its a thousand times more interesting thanb dishonored
[1:16:59] <Ravioli_Ronin> @huskarl_zap it really kind of is tbh
[1:17:02] <generalve> Yes it is kim
[1:17:02] <%AzureGale> Kenshi still talks about how they were the football champ back when they were in high school

[1:33:33] <Aydarkzero> huh
[1:33:38] <yeeyeyee> That's how warrants work @PatStaresAt
[1:33:38] <penitentpendant> @ghoulspan A spiritual successor to Planescape Torment, in many ways
[1:33:39] <%NovaKnightmare> Its actually how bail works
[1:33:40] <+Jiggisnipe> that's fucked lol
[1:33:43] <Visorak6> I mean that's basically the same thing we do but with less steps
[1:33:46] <aiutare47> @SomeAsianDood yeah, hence the revolution
[1:33:47] <Psyramics> if they flee the country, fine, they aren't our problem anymore
[1:33:47] <naoi0> I'm pretty sure that's how the real world works too
[1:33:50] <%Alazull> One would imagine they would be put on a Do Not Fly list
[1:33:51] <%linSP> SHOW UP TO JAIL OR GET FUCKED
[1:33:51] <$ArtoriasTheTrenchfighter> It's like not showing up for a court case, but more advanced yeah
[1:33:52] <Djinnazz> unless your an illegal alien.
[1:33:54] <Brandon__Brando> @ghoulspan a 10/10 crpg
[1:33:56] <ghoulspan> is this game just CAPITALISM BAD, COMMUNISM GOOD
[1:33:57] <%MassConnect> not gonna lie, leaving the country is preferable than dealing with "justice"
[1:33:57] <%Eilocke> oh yeah, that's basically just bail
[1:33:58] <sirtommygunn> If they flee, its outside their jurisdiction anyway
[1:34:00] <hippofant> @SomeAsianDood There was a brief communist revolution in between. The Commune of Revachol.
[1:34:04] <EternalJedi> we basically do that now, you're not usually jailed pending your court day
[1:34:05] <%VHGS> @ghoulspan no
[1:34:05] <%Blackleafx> WOW, VERY UNREALISTIC
[1:34:08] <LegitBarnacleBoy> @PatStaresAt maybe music a weeee bit quieter?
[1:34:10] <CursedNobleman> beating people with a clipboard isnt killing someone though
[1:34:13] <%hax_metatron> @ghoulspan The authors are Marxists so yes
[1:34:19] <nomos42> @ghoulspan no, it's a lot more smart than that
[1:34:21] <%NovaKnightmare> @ghoulspan no, every idelogy is grey in this
[1:34:23] <%VHGS> I mean it is very clearly made by communists, but still
[1:34:24] <penitentpendant> @ghoulspan No, you can choose the idealism you champion
[1:34:27] <Brandon__Brando> @ghoulspan no its more thoughtful then that
[1:34:38] <+Riecharus> Weird they count kills publicly but come down hard on them
[1:34:38] <aiutare47> @hax_metatron Oh? Where'd you here that
[1:34:48] <%hax_metatron> While the writing is nuanced, the text is definitely Marxist
[1:34:48] <%Blackleafx> @hax_metatron The authors are also aware of how fucking tiresome being a Marxist is, every political ideology in this game gets satirized
[1:34:49] <BiologicGases> is it just me or is the music way louder than the voice acting?
[1:34:51] <$metzselaar> Kinda like bounty hunters...
[1:34:52] <ghoulspan> @hax_metatron making their capitalist dreams come true throught the massive selling of their game, very ironic dont you think
[1:34:54] <Visorak6> @ghoulspan No this game relentlessly dunks on all political ideologies, including not taking a stance at all
[1:34:56] <yeeyeyee> @ghoulspan no they take the big piss out of communists, liberals, capitalists and centrists in equal biting measure
[1:34:56] <%hax_metatron> The developers shouted out Marx in the Game Awards
[1:34:57] <+purplestufff> 2 sad 4 me
[1:34:58] <+ReallyBigRocks> The game definitely shits on you no matter what ideology you decide
[1:34:58] <%GarbageNirvana> This game has super in-depth world building and it's fucking great
[1:35:08] <%Blackleafx> @BiologicGases yea its badly mixed
[1:35:11] <+elhafnero> more like maintain the odor amirite
[1:35:11] <BerryliciousDefinition> @BiologicGases Yeah I agree
[1:35:12] <cardamomo88> power to the people
[1:35:12] <%holydeviant1> The only political stance that is outright HATED is centrism
[1:35:16] <+sumrand0> How FANTASICAL the idea that cops get held accountable? Man who comes up with these unrealistic ideas lol
[1:35:18] <CursedNobleman> @ghoulspan ehh, they spike all factions. commies are foolish fanatics, libertarians are stupid hustlers, moderates are good for nothing bueraucrats, and fascists are insecure tarts
[1:35:20] <%dalmek> politariat is proletariat but police
[1:35:22] <@commanderclaw> The PoProletariat
[1:35:24] <yeeyeyee> @ghoulspan it goes hard out of its way to point out that no ideology is bloodless or morally superior by its own merit
[1:35:33] <+ShutUpAceyP> I like this game but I'm too stupid about politics to understand what is all going on...
[1:35:36] <%hax_metatron> @ghoulspan That's some "We live in a society" nonsense LUL... You can make money espousing Marxist ideals nothing's stopping you
[1:35:41] <%SilvaChariot0133> Centrist Faction
[1:35:41] <+glgzephyr> THE CENTRISTS

[1:36:30] <aiutare47> MAYBE HE HAS AN OPINION PAT
[1:36:31] <naoi0> I think I more played the game as a moralist and ended up getting like a lot of opportunities for the sociologies
[1:36:36] <%SilvaChariot0133> difference between having NO stance and being centrist
[1:36:38] <Brandon__Brando> so nothing
[1:36:39] <%hax_metatron> LUL Centrism is not a position ./.. people are suffering in this world

[1:37:07] <yeeyeyee> Moralists believe humans are good and deserve to exist over all other forms of life simply because they're human, and any means necessary to expand humanity are justified
[1:37:08] <+purplestufff> inland empire hitting it on the mark there
[1:37:08] <+MidnightBurst12> spooky

[1:39:51] <%GarbageNirvana> Can you tell this game's writer has books under his belt
[1:39:54] <huskarl_zap> Keeping criminals  alive to keep committing crimes like batman
[1:39:54] <jorniev> THIS IS THE SHITITEST JUDGE DREEDD EVER
[1:40:02] <%hax_metatron> This line was proof to me that Kim might be gay
[1:40:06] <%GarbageQueenEllie> they beat their kids more on mainland i guess
[1:40:19] <hippofant> @hax_metatron which line?
[1:40:23] <jorniev> THE COMPANY singular?
[1:40:35] <%Fenrisulfr_V> You can make Harry gay in this game, right? I never tried.
[1:40:40] <+purplestufff> city's already disintegrated my boy
[1:40:44] <+ParryLurr> is the voiceacting good?
[1:40:46] <aiutare47> So if anyone wants my 2nd opinion that upsets everyone I talk to about this game: It legit made me think a bit different about the police.
[1:40:51] <+ReallyBigRocks> spoken like a true centrist
[1:40:53] <%za7az> @jorniev You heard him
[1:40:58] <oozebear> where is the button to kiss kim
[1:40:58] <yeeyeyee> @Fenrisulfr_V no, but you can make him unsure
[1:41:01] <BerryliciousDefinition> <3
[1:41:01] <+glgzephyr> @ParryLurr Can't you judge that yourself from this?
[1:41:02] <hippofant> @Fenrisulfr_V You can make him disturbingly obsessed with it, but his backstory remains fixed.
[1:41:04] <+stoutfish> @Fenrisulfr_V not really, you can make him really weird about it though
[1:41:06] <available_line> VA is stellar
[1:41:07] <%GarbageQueenEllie> @aiutare47 Like how
[1:41:08] <BiologicGases> its odd how negative my mind is compared to yours pat lol
[1:41:10] <jorniev> KIM IS THE BEST
[1:41:13] <Nordguy> you tell me dude @parrylurr
[1:41:15] <+ParryLurr> i just hopped in
[1:41:23] <NeutrinoInteraction> @Fenrisulfr_V You can kinda hint at that he's questioning
[1:41:23] <naoi0> @aiutare47 Yeah I mean like, it's a cop game. LA Noire made me reconsider the police and it's in an entirely different field than this game
[1:41:25] <+glgzephyr> stick around and listen then
[1:41:27] <+ParryLurr> nakatFOH
[1:41:31] <CursedNobleman> stupid sexy kim NotLikeThis
[1:41:31] <laserbeaming> Kim absolutely hates you if you go fascist. That's the main reason I haven't done a fascist playthough
[1:41:39] <hippofant> @aiutare47 Why would that upset people? I thought this was clearly meant to make us think that there could be another way cops worked.
[1:41:39] <+ParryLurr> fine...
[1:41:40] <cardamomo88> the the homosexual underground people
[1:41:41] <penitentpendant> Prybar and Bag ended up being my passive when in the world
[1:41:44] <%torusendor> @aiutare47 Police serve a valuable function in society when their focus is actually public safety instead of protecting property rights
[1:41:45] <T_Sasquatch> @aiutare47 good , open your mind to new things !
[1:41:48] <%shurtal> Hobo Cop crackin' the case! ...of who those CAPITALIST FUCKPIGS are
[1:41:48] <$metzselaar> That's the scary thing about humans. They are only human.
[1:41:51] <%Fenrisulfr_V> I plan on doing the biggest, strongest scumbag as my second playthrough.
[1:41:57] <+strakillias> Pat, put kim to bed

[1:42:02] <naoi0> she went to sleep
[1:42:02] <+ShutUpAceyP> SING
[1:42:05] <aiutare47> @GarbageQueenEllie it reminded me that under the assholes and powertrippers there are people like Kim out there, that really just want to help people, and they are let down by the people who abuse it
[1:42:08] <+waltzqueen> let Kim sleep
[1:42:08] <jorniev> it really says how much of a fuck i am that i agree with the moralinterm in almost everything and i still hate them so much
[1:42:09] <NeroInfinite> she went to bed
[1:42:13] <penitentpendant> @Fenrisulfr_V Enjoy the High Shivers!
[1:42:14] <+ShutUpAceyP> SING ON STREAM
[1:42:15] <CursedNobleman> @laserbeaming does he? i went fascist, but i defended kim like he was 'one of the good ones. my seolite best friend.' LUL
[1:42:15] <%hax_metatron> @torusendor Yes exactly, that's why the cops need to be defunded and should be a public enterprise
[1:42:15] <%Blackleafx> Sorry for asking again, but I haven't watched the podcast yet, what was that talk earlier about Woolie wanting "enlightened centrism"?
[1:42:16] <laserbeaming> give Kim a good night kiss
[1:42:21] <%za7az> Too late, she DIED KappaHD
[1:42:28] <penitentpendant> Read ledger! Night is best time to read!
[1:42:28] <NeroInfinite> give kim kith
[1:42:29] <dukenux> @aiutare47 i think this game would me reconsider police force in the opposite way LA Noire did
[1:42:35] <+ShutUpAceyP> sing in real life
[1:42:36] <nomos42> Aha!
[1:42:40] <%TheMattman1313> Time for DRUGS
[1:42:42] <naoi0> @PatStaresAt Try the mirror again?
[1:42:44] <SomeAsianDood> I must have missed it. did pat get the comment about running around like crazy from kim?
[1:42:44] <%hax_metatron> Woolie basically believes in Centrism and thinks it's enlightenment... that's all it is
[1:42:44] <dukenux> make me*
[1:42:47] <Sol_Install> ok
[1:42:49] <bettysharkface> Get the boots!
[1:42:50] <%king_wragles> kk
[1:42:52] <+glgzephyr> eh, c'est la vie
[1:42:52] <NeroInfinite> now you can give cuno drugs
[1:42:53] <iosephe> ok
[1:42:53] <cardamomo88> oh boy
[1:42:53] <penitentpendant> Fair enough
[1:42:53] <bettysharkface> Aw beans
[1:42:55] <bettysharkface> Ok
[1:42:56] <%Ranryu692> no worries, do what you need to
[1:42:56] <%Blackleafx> @hax_metatron Gotcha
[1:42:57] <Brandon__Brando> @Fenrisulfr_V I cant wait to do drunk fascist super cop
[1:42:59] <%torusendor> @hax_metatron I mean, they're already a public enterprise...technically
[1:43:00] <naoi0> @SomeAsianDood Yeah
[1:43:00] <Saltmeisterr> NOOOO THE DRUGS
[1:43:05] <%linSP> drugs drugs drugs
[1:43:07] <%Fenrisulfr_V> Go beat up Cuno.
[1:43:07] <Broken_Sonex> @hax_metatron Ugh....
[1:43:11] <DiksieNormis> cuno drugs
[1:43:16] <penitentpendant> Need paige back to absorb "The Curse of Kenshi"
[1:43:17] <%hax_metatron> @torusendor With way too much state-sponsored power
[1:43:22] <+ParryLurr> not the aesthetic i expected from this game. its pretty. though it would be more cartoony
[1:43:23] <nomos42> @hax_metatron wasn't he just reference the enlightened centrist meme?
[1:43:24] <+JustToWatch> @hax_metatron you know he was joking right
[1:43:26] <user_naim> Woolie was surely joking about the enlightened part, right?
[1:43:26] <%Blackleafx> @hax_metatron Was he saying it ironically? I've never heard anyone use the term "enlightened centrism" unironically
[1:43:30] <%Blackleafx> but then again, woolie is woolie
[1:43:35] <Parapattern> Saying "enlightened" centrists is a way of making fun of centrists
[1:43:35] <sirtommygunn> The thing about ACAB is that even good people in the cop's position are bastards. The power of the police as an institution forces them to be bastards, it can't be fixed by just having people with good intentions become cops
[1:43:36] <zepelinnn1> what are you guys saying? he said that ironically
[1:43:48] <zepelinnn1> you guys might not be good at reading social cues
[1:43:48] <aiutare47> @dukenux Kinda. I LOVE how Kim keeps you in check, great writing. Even people in chat were saying how they wanted to try different paths, but didnt want to upset Kim. Such a good juxtaposition
[1:43:54] <SomeAsianDood> I think that was when I knew this game was great and not good when kim calls u out on running everywhere like a madman
[1:43:56] <%Blackleafx> Ill just listen to the podcast and judge for myself, but yeah I could see it being a joke
[1:44:09] <nomos42> Woolie is pretty based
[1:44:15] <%hax_metatron> He didn't say it ironically ... it was also not that bad
[1:44:15] <%Blackleafx> @SomeAsianDood If you actually walk, he wont mention it
[1:44:15] <Brandon__Brando> ahhh ya I knew this game would bring the fun out in this chat
[1:44:18] <+D00msDayDan> @zepelinnn1 sometimes with woolie it's hard to tell if it's a bit about a bit about a bit about a bit about a bit
[1:44:18] <+glgzephyr> @zepelinnn1 Pat seems to think it wasn't ironic, and I'd trust his opinion of Woolie over my own
[1:44:19] <%Blackleafx> Woolie is Woolie
[1:44:20] <naoi0> @SomeAsianDood Yeah I love little 4th wall breaks or like acknowledgement of mechanics in games
[1:44:23] <%toastybites> It was a joke
[1:44:31] <%GarbageNirvana> But is he redpilled
[1:44:34] <SomeAsianDood> @blackleafx exactly
[1:44:40] <%torusendor> @hax_metatron It's less the amount of power and more the broadness
[1:44:41] <%Blackleafx> TBH Pat can wretch at it being a joke as well
[1:44:41] <nomos42> @glgzephyr Nah, I don't think pat does
[1:44:41] <user_naim> Woolie might’ve killed a guy, but he would never unironically call himself or anyone enlightened
[1:44:42] <%hax_metatron> Nah Woolie is a good boy
[1:44:44] <hippofant> @Blackleafx Think that's one of those, "People did not realise they were being memed and instead took it up as a real positive label," tings
[1:44:51] <+stoutfish> what does it even mean to be red pilled in 2021
[1:45:07] <%Blackleafx> I mean Woolie is 100% gonna go Moralist in his playthroug
[1:45:12] <%hax_metatron> Woolie is good, but he doesn't fully believe in some leftist ideals ... which frustrates me as a leftist ... but that's okay.
[1:45:12] <Broken_Sonex> @zepelinnn1 THIS
[1:45:14] <%Blackleafx> which'll be funny considering they're the theocrat
[1:45:15] <%torusendor> @hax_metatron Too many functions are handled by cops that should be handled by unarmed civil servants
[1:45:18] <%Blackleafx> BACK TO CHURCH
[1:45:25] <sirtommygunn> i thought redpilling was a libertarian thing at this point
[1:45:34] <+Jiggisnipe> Guys the enlightened thing is a reference to a subreddit LUL
[1:45:35] <Brandon__Brando> all Im wondering is will woolie accept the race theory
[1:45:38] <NeroInfinite> I want woolie to go full on right winger
[1:45:40] <CursedNobleman> pat is being a sorry cop
[1:45:41] <primaryfire> if there are activities you wanna do without Kim, now is the time
[1:45:41] <%cvp5127> the kenshi curse
[1:45:45] <+SundanceShot> it happens
[1:45:45] <%Fenrisulfr_V> I didn't know that blackpilling got co-opted by incels, either.
[1:45:47] <Khester824> Kenshi is haunting your tv
[1:45:48] <%Blackleafx> @hax_metatron Pat is so based about  that stuff
[1:45:50] <cardamomo88> the kenshin ghost
[1:45:56] <oozebear> aw beans
[1:45:58] <VHLW> gpu issue?
[1:45:58] <nomos42> @hax_metatron yeah he quite lib at times
[1:46:00] <Blank9> Is it going into Aero Mode or something when OBS is active?
[1:46:03] <+MidnightBurst12> the stench of kenshi lingers on
[1:46:07] <wolfen091> game god is punishing you for the playing of the fortnuts
[1:46:09] <%bassoontyphoon> Shit happens
[1:46:13] <%torusendor> @zepelinnn1 Woolie is a centrist who can't admit he's a centrist
[1:46:15] <%LeiaSkynoober> You're fine, Pat! It happens to the best!
[1:46:15] <CursedNobleman> @NeroInfinite as an asian american, wearing the white nationalist skin ingame is a very interesting feeling
[1:46:16] <AvroEltz> I know it might be a stretch, but have you tried removing some of the not necessary cables connected to the tv?
[1:46:20] <+stoutfish> @sirtommygunn it originated from the mens right movement, taking the red pill was the "realization" that women operate on a purely biological level
[1:46:20] <Aydarkzero> it's bound to happen
[1:46:21] <%Blackleafx> LETS DO IT
[1:46:21] <%GarbageNirvana> I mean Woolie's already pretty dangerously close to suffering from irony poisoning as it is
[1:46:22] <Aydarkzero> also lol
[1:46:22] <%linSP> Oh my god my 3080 stopped my pc from booting when it tried to change the resolution in a game
[1:46:24] <Broken_Sonex> DAMN YOU KENSHI!

[1:46:28] <+sumrand0> YAY DRUGS
[1:46:28] <oozebear> YES, CORRUPT THE CHILD
[1:46:29] <aiutare47> Aww, but youll make Kim upset
[1:46:32] <%ClericOfSparda> Yeah!
[1:46:37] <nomos42> Pat, can you clarify that woolie isn't an elightened centrist and he was joking on the pod
[1:46:37] <%ClericOfSparda> CORRUPTION
[1:46:40] <%OrangeMDT> Sorry cop indeed
[1:46:42] <%walternatorz> I'm glad Pat remembered the important things.
[1:46:42] <Blank9> not if kim doesn't know
[1:46:49] <user_naim> druuugsh
[1:46:49] <sirtommygunn> @stoutfish Thanks for the reminder, also I hate it
[1:46:50] <PartyFavors> Kim's out of the party and doesn't know
[1:46:52] <jorniev> wow pat
[1:46:55] <+BubbaRands> Enabling Childhood addiction is F U N LUL
[1:46:59] <%Mr_Pylon> can't break Kim's heart when he's not there
[1:47:03] <bettysharkface> GET THE BOOTS
[1:47:05] <%shurtal> Cuno's gonna rat you OUT tomorrow
[1:47:06] <+JustToWatch> I really don't think you can actually determine what Woolie's politics are because he doesn't go on rants like Pat does
[1:47:07] <%GarbageQueenEllie> Doing things ironically can be a gateway drug to doing things FOR REALSIES
[1:47:11] <%MelBrooksKA> Pour a forty of crack on the curb and SSSSSSSSmoke it!
[1:47:12] <naoi0> oh no
[1:47:12] <%Fenrisulfr_V> I feel like Cuno would absolutely rat out Harry.

[1:47:14] <nomos42> *Kim watches from his window*
[1:47:14] <naoi0> he doesn't want it
[1:47:14] <sirtommygunn> Kim has no way of finding out about this
[1:47:17] <thelonechris> Cuno is the best character ever
[1:47:21] <cardamomo88> TAKE THE DRUSG SHIR KID
[1:47:21] <+stoutfish> @sirtommygunn Afterwards, the red pill was a eupheumism for "racial awakening" that racialists proclaim to have, the "realization" that different races operate on biological principles
[1:47:22] <nomos42> \s
[1:47:22] <+glgzephyr> Cuno has very specific tastes LUL

[1:55:25] <%linSP> hookah is pretty bad for you
[1:55:25] <Ravioli_Ronin> Big Rubber Tongs
[1:55:27] <%Ranryu692> I used to own a hookah
[1:55:31] <%GarbageQueenEllie> sheesha shoosha shoshka mooshka bobbity boopy
[1:55:32] <vapidq> the lebanese?
[1:55:37] <huskarl_zap> Canada big heroin
[1:55:38] <tetrabrick1lt> THEM?
[1:55:38] <Lancaster_H> the lebanese?
[1:55:41] <dukenux> shishah is a different name for hookah
[1:55:41] <+ShutUpAceyP> why does your stream keep repeating itself then skipping forward?
[1:55:43] <%Ranryu692> they must fuck with your allergy so badly
[1:55:44] <SaltyAzteca> Its the smoke isnt it
[1:55:44] <%bassoontyphoon> NOT ANYMORE
[1:55:45] <%toastybites> cuz of the nicotine
[1:55:46] <+ReallyBigRocks> Hookah is fucking ass garbage for you, shit is like a cigarette hose
[1:55:46] <sirtommygunn> former french colony, makes sense
[1:55:46] <%rumtumtugnutz> There's a lot of hookah parlors in Calgary
[1:55:47] <+icekept> but u cant smell?
[1:55:47] <DianaTheAscian> same Pat
[1:55:49] <toomanygnome> pat hates the lebanese
[1:55:50] <+BigBruthaThunda> never done more than a few poofs
[1:55:53] <T_Sasquatch> Its almost like inhaling shit isnt great for you
[1:55:55] <%psidefx> Hooka is weird to me
[1:55:56] <SaltyAzteca> There's a certain stench in the vapour
[1:55:56] <jorkoal> isn't half an hour of hookah the same as 100 cigarettes?
[1:55:59] <Devbob98> Hookah smells awful, worst night of my life
[1:56:00] <%Nobrev> oh yeah the perfume allergy
[1:56:00] <Blank9> I've gone to one and it was just boring
[1:56:02] <SomeAsianDood> really? u can't just say that about the Lebanese
[1:56:08] <%king_wragles> The 2nd hand from hookah is very strong
[1:56:09] <dukenux> its just tobacco smoke
[1:56:14] <%rumtumtugnutz> There's a pizza place I used to like that opened a Shisha longe and now the pizza tastes like cigarettes
[1:56:14] <user_naim> Pat dies at the Jekk Jekk Tar?
[1:56:16] <Blank9> just hang out at a bowling alley instead
[1:56:17] <dinnydanny777> yeah I've had those
[1:56:18] <Aydarkzero> @ShutUpAceyP are you switching between tabs cause thats how i get that
[1:56:19] <%king_wragles> You're right
[1:56:20] <TurtlesAndTentacles> I have to get drunk to smoke that stuff. It is a bit much
[1:56:23] <%king_wragles> it IS tobaccco smoke
[1:56:23] <%dalmek> @ShutUpAceyP if it's what I'm thinking of, switch off of Auto quality to something else (Twitch is having an issue for a while)
[1:56:24] <%ABakedDemon> Like the I drannk a whole bottle of jameson kind of headache?
[1:56:24] <AvroEltz> what would a drug cop do if he got a case inside a shishah parlor?
[1:56:25] <+twohitgood> it's just tobacco through a water bong.
[1:56:27] <aiutare47> Yeah Ottawa has a lot of Lebanese folks to, I wonder why?
[1:56:28] <%Fenrisulfr_V> I can barely stand being around people that vape nicotine, let alone actually inhaling something myself.
[1:56:30] <%king_wragles> A poisonous plant that people smoke
[1:56:32] <%TheMattman1313> correction, it IS tobacco smoke and incense
[1:56:32] <%Valdorick> Tabaco smoke is also awful
[1:56:33] <dinnydanny777> the migraines I mean, not the hookah NotLikeThis
[1:56:33] <%Mr_Pylon> perfumes can fuck you up
[1:56:34] <iosephe> Tobacco is an awful smell
[1:56:35] <Jonny_Uppercut> Oh good the body is still in the tree I missed simultaneously nothing but a lot
[1:56:35] <thelonechris> Tobacco is pretty much poison
[1:56:36] <%Tuna_Can_0> its only like 50 cigs atpCap
[1:56:37] <%rumtumtugnutz> But it isn't, though?
[1:56:37] <+strakillias> Its also very potent
[1:56:38] <Visorak6> Me too Pat people dont respect it at all
[1:56:40] <%BigCoffee> Very special and smelly people in hookah parlors
[1:56:43] <cardamomo88> SAME
[1:56:44] <TurtlesAndTentacles> BURN ON GUY
[1:56:44] <%Undenizen> you can get electric vape shishas now
[1:56:47] <%GarbageQueenEllie> Why do stupid people love inhaling poison so much?
[1:56:48] <+Jiggisnipe> well that makes sense
[1:56:52] <brachydios777> That’s some old shit
[1:56:53] <%superc37> also tabacco fucking sucks and anyone who smokes it is stupid
[1:56:54] <Johndagger17> Silly Pat, you're supposed to drink the hookah water afterwards.
[1:56:57] <user_naim> Is Quebec Nar Shaddaa?
[1:56:58] <Visorak6> YEP, EVERY GODDAMN TIME
[1:56:58] <$SGrim> Also, tobacco is fucking disgusting
[1:56:59] <+chiazam> Would you say it could kill you Pat?
[1:57:00] <SorceressLeFay> "Its only tobacco" as if that makes it better
[1:57:00] <+possumwalsh1221> It’s not just tobacco there’s molasses and like he said perfumes lol
[1:57:02] <SaltyAzteca> I feel that way with potpourri, it just makes me dizzy
[1:57:02] <penitentpendant> Pat HP go down in vicinity. To quote Kotor: "POISON! POISON! POISON!"
[1:57:07] <DianaTheAscian> @PatStaresAt is that how u discovered your perfume allergy?
[1:57:08] <+BigBruthaThunda> adding weed to one can be really fun, if you're into that kind of thing
[1:57:09] <HeroToxiko> yup
[1:57:11] <sirtommygunn> second hand smoke is bad, you get all the downsides with none of the high

[1:57:29] <KaiserMario> @PatStaresAt huh, you didn't heal?
[1:57:30] <ItIsSky> I can't stand to be in candle aisles in stores. I just get an instant headache
[1:57:30] <+strakillias> My mom did that one and it made my skin burn
[1:57:32] <%Mr_Pylon> there was a vendor at my previous work who wore so much perfume that I could literally smell her enter the building
[1:57:35] <%Puhff> Yeah my mom...
[1:57:35] <+purplestufff> do you get that with deodorant or just perfume?
[1:57:37] <%GarbageQueenEllie> Imagine some idiot tryna light up in one of those places
[1:57:40] <HeroToxiko> You're taking stage hazard damage till you leave LUL
[1:57:41] <%Fenrisulfr_V> My parents are chainsmokers, and any time they try to mask it, it just gets so much fucking worse.
[1:57:42] <dukenux> no i mean like no suprise youd get sick by tobacco smell @patstaresat i thought that was the problem, not potpourri
[1:57:43] <Parapattern> Just quite bullshitting around and straigtup  inhale gasoline fumes
[1:57:52] <%rumtumtugnutz> Hookahs are just bongs that you use to smoke tobacco
[1:57:52] <%linSP> id prefer to smell farts over perfumed farts, no im not weird
[1:57:53] <%Tuna_Can_0> But I want my house to smell like bed bath and beyond :(
[1:57:53] <%TheMattman1313> I once got DoorDash and the bag smelled like tobacco smoke for being in a car for 10 miinutes
[1:57:57] <huskarl_zap> perfect health huh
[1:58:05] <%bassoontyphoon> Probably to cover up the stench of dead and rotting hopes and dreams
[1:58:07] <reonome> a ghost
[1:58:07] <dinnydanny777> @parapattern But petrol smells good though
[1:58:10] <sirtommygunn> did the stream skip or was that an audio bug

[2:24:01] <aiutare47> @brachydios777 Revachol is East French German, but the other countries are a bit looser in terms of a metaphor

[2:25:26] <%Blackleafx> @sirtommygunn I think you couldn't talk to her before you learn about the Pale, and now you can talk to her right off the bat
