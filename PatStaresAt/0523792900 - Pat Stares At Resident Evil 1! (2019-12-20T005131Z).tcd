[0:38:18] <joylent_blue> demegodz japanese voice directors not knowing english and just winging it
[0:38:18] <SoySocks> should've anchored it to part of the piano or something
[0:38:19] <+Flasktoss> He tried to anchor it to the melting snake.
[0:38:20] <SpiritoftheBat> Good job Barry

[0:38:25] <%demegodz> Now I've done it!
[0:38:26] <+Chopper3k> best voice acting in the biz
[0:38:26] <%crimsonharvest> just coil the rope and throw it is a skill they teach to cub scouts
[0:38:27] <%NWR_James> Why cant she just throw the rope back to him?
[0:38:28] <%bigboy3d> She sounds such like a girl that tries to sound like a woman
[0:38:30] <%Owkono> we should get a reremake with all original voiceovers
[0:38:34] <peachy996> like 10 seconds
[0:38:34] <Run44forrest> so theres nothing down there?
[0:38:35] <homurau> chat can i bring a small suitcase on a plane as a carry-on?
[0:38:37] <+Lost_Zombie> Barry was so remorseful he fused the second rope with the floor
[0:38:45] <%StaceMcGate> @demegodz voice director didn't speak English, he wanted certain tones or cadences without caring about English translation
[0:38:45] <Ner234> Wait you have to actually wait?
[0:38:45] <Dhurkst> he protecc, he atacc, but most importantly, he come bacc

[0:39:14] <shandytowne> t h a t
[0:39:16] <Rich_In_Antioxidants> Why didnt Jill just throw the rope back up to him?
[0:39:16] <peachy996> Hunters be everywhere and arguably tougher in RE1 than REmake
[0:39:18] <%grimm_hatter> also spiders in dog hallway
[0:39:21] <%honeyman18> So did Barry cut the first rope from the second original big rope?
[0:39:22] <%crimsonharvest> what was the point of that
[0:39:23] <shinji_ifrit> THA T
[0:39:24] <vedammi> you have 3x the viewers as woolie the pie stealer
[0:39:26] <DrkJP520> it's kinda weird that you wait for barry to come back instead of moving on with no way back up. more tension and what not
[0:39:27] <%ThatOneGuyYouSaw> @StaceMcGate it's hard to critique languages you can't understand
[0:39:29] <%Jekado> he's hungry for some JILL sandwiches

[0:40:09] <%StaceMcGate> @Dhurkst ...Shenmue 3 came out?
[0:40:21] <kingbaconcrispy> No it's for a door in the west wing, it's a short cut

[0:41:08] <Run44forrest> hggOkay
[0:41:10] <+Punchasaur> Sounds like clock tower
[0:41:11] <%Guardiansaiyan> @korpocalypse PLAY IT
[0:41:12] <%BurningLlama777> I imagine a small, sparsely furnished house up above, but arranged so it was believable. My actual house and all my stuff would be in the secret subterranean house.
[0:41:12] <%Rngiddion> can music really be good if it wasn't made under questionable circumstance by a fraud?
[0:41:13] <%SoFarFetched> I need to finish off RE1 Remake,but I need to remember what I was doing.
[0:41:17] <+Shadowpint> I never understood how the old RE games were scary even at the time
[0:41:20] <peachy996> At the time I cowered while my older cousin and mom played this and RE2
[0:41:21] <%blondie_ow> Crimson heads are one of the scariest enemies ever imo.
[0:41:22] <+Rivet95> I couldn't handle the dogs coming into the hall as a 5 year old
[0:41:25] <+Scevda> I was afraid of the Forest Temple in OOT
[0:41:26] <%SoFarFetched> I think Im pretty much where pat is on the remake in this.
[0:41:26] <homurau> kablamzo.
[0:41:26] <%ClaudeMcGarren> you sound like a chump koraial
[0:41:28] <%TOONFOOD> The OG scared my pussy ass up, you guys are hardcore or lying
[0:41:34] <iWBstovetop> I find classic style RE games more anxiety inducing (between being caught off guard + resource management) than scary
[0:41:35] <allanmiri> The REmake is a beautiful kinda spooky.
[0:41:37] <Run44forrest> hasBoomer aaaa scary
[0:41:40] <%BayowolfTerra> ReMake scariest resident evil?
[0:41:48] <42nfl19> @AngriestPat Shouldn't the zombies be wearing lab coats? Werent the first infected the scientist? Is the green suits like the guards?
[0:41:48] <tripessolides> no crimson heads in this makes it so easier
[0:41:50] <%Theastrica> aw man i missed the opening scene
[0:41:51] <%Tenchi_G> Play fatal frame. Not as scary
[0:41:53] <%StaceMcGate> I remember being scared by FF7 as a kid LUL Shinra Tower was frightening
[0:41:53] <+NinjaWitaSniper> I kinda wished they had crimson heads in RE2Make
[0:41:54] <%Jekado> explains a lot for pat
[0:41:54] <TrollKing96> Is that one sample the same one they use for Tekken?
[0:41:54] <PabuPanda> I can't actually play games like this. Tension and anxiety gets the better of me.
[0:41:58] <%NWR_James> RE scared me but mostly because I couldn't feel like I was in control. Cuz you know tank controls are for losers
[0:41:59] <officerodoherty> @Rivet95 same, couldn't handle the look of the og zombie in that first room eitherSDFJDKFSJ, but i was 4
[0:41:59] <shandytowne> wow pat you're so hardcore please be my dad
[0:41:59] <homurau> resident evil 3 scared me as a child. nemesis traumatized me.
[0:42:00] <korpocalypse> yaa u probly played it outside in the sun i bet tho @AngriestPat
[0:42:02] <$QueequegTheater> Sure thing Pat Kappa
[0:42:02] <%Wrashis> @AngriestPat the briefcase scare got me the first time i played cvx. does that count?
[0:42:03] <%walternatorz> how's that subnautica playthrough coming along?
[0:42:04] <%starotter70> 2 and 3 scared me more
[0:42:07] <iinkpools> RE0 scared the shit out of me
[0:42:07] <peachy996> RE1 and 2 when you're 8 changes things
[0:42:08] <%DatGuyJimbo> are you going for the dog ending
[0:42:11] <Tubit> yeah, i was legit spooked by this at the time
[0:42:11] <+Shadowpint> I didn't find Silent Hill scary either
[0:42:13] <+Jimboq> rekt
[0:42:13] <%grimm_hatter> @angriestpat be a real man, pistol only
[0:42:14] <%radda343> why is this kitchen hidden under a grave ladder
[0:42:14] <+LegendaryDorkKnight> no custom channel points?
[0:42:14] <jackstedy> IT was rad
[0:42:15] <%crimsonharvest> as an 8 year old kid I was TERRIFIED of empty rooms in zelda 1 because of those hand monsters
[0:42:18] <Dragovus> That grab range
[0:42:19] <zenith0111> LUL
[0:42:21] <%Taisuru> RE1 scared me off horror stuff for most of my life, only recently as a 28 year old have I started to overcome it
[0:42:21] <+Rivet95> @officerodoherty yeah, that first turn was horrifying at that age.
[0:42:22] <DrkJP520> there's sonething about the old graphics that creep me the fuck out. i remember playing duke nukem 3d a few years ago and constantly having shivers
[0:42:23] <AzureHawk_Streams> Look and marvel at the power of fixed camera angles.
[0:42:23] <%ennui_on_me> Sometimes your ability to be scared gets better with age. I played Silent Hill 2 in middle school and find that game way harder to sit through now.
[0:42:24] <Ultimatefool> Zombie kick no jutsu!
[0:42:25] <%FirearmsInstructor> @AngriestPat .... dude if you get fucking decapped again....
[0:42:26] <flyingtentaclemonster> !uptime
[0:42:26] <@Moobot> I've been playing this game for how long? Oh only 42m 28s.
[0:42:31] <%StaceMcGate> StaceMcGate gifted a Tier 1 sub to QueequegTheater! They have given 12 Gift Subs in the channel! 
[0:42:33] <%StaceMcGate> StaceMcGate's Gift shared rewards to 5 others in Chat! 
[0:42:33] <flyingtentaclemonster> Oh shoot Im late
[0:42:35] <Rich_In_Antioxidants> 12 year old Pat playing Fatal Frame. Nah this aint scary. Ghost waifus gonna kill my dick
[0:42:36] <%BurningLlama777> @crimsonharvest I hate those things.
[0:42:37] <morganagod> I don't remember being scared, but I do remember getting startled on occasion by, like, the crocodile or things busting through walls.
[0:42:38] <JFrostyBeats> RE1 feels like a campy b movie.
[0:42:41] <%trustycoyote> I love horror movies but when it comes to games.... WAY to tense to play. My life is stressful enough as is! @AngriestPat
[0:42:43] <allanmiri> LIke Hunters
[0:42:44] <KingGoblodyte> I wonder if there's any Hot Pockets in that fridge...
[0:42:44] <Ner234> Why did this zombie get a cutscene?
[0:42:44] <%Guardiansaiyan> EMOTES for everyone!
[0:42:45] <+Flasktoss> Especially.
[0:42:47] <homurau> nemesis made me paranoid to this day about people barging in and possibly bursting through the walls.
[0:42:47] <%QueequegTheater> @StaceMcGate woo Kappa
[0:42:47] <%ThatOneGuyYouSaw> what does it mean?
[0:42:48] <PortableBoredom> Does that mean it's bad against zombies
[0:42:52] <Jack_DT> Can Jill defeat Goku?
[0:42:52] <GarbageQueenEllie> Aaagh, all those Jill Sandwiches I ate made me sick...
[0:42:53] <redrins> not powerful against crashes tho
[0:42:53] <rytisone> dont miss

[0:43:09] <mirfosevik> @AngriestPat What was the scare here in remake?
[0:43:09] <peachy996> Can he do it
[0:43:09] <%QueequegTheater> @AngriestPat I saw Nightmare on Elm Street as a 4-year-old thanks to an inattentive babysitter and her college aged son not noticing I was in the room
[0:43:10] <homurau> nemesis and mr. x both did.
[0:43:10] <%StaceMcGate> Don't die
[0:43:11] <korpocalypse> have you seen speedruns of this game? @AngriestPat

[0:43:49] <%crimsonharvest> good thing you have this anti-living-thing weapon
[0:43:49] <Froyuken> A single acid round takes them out, eh?
[0:43:53] <%QueequegTheater> @AngriestPat Beat RE2 at 11? Can you beat this: I saw Nightmare on Elm Street as a 4-year-old thanks to an inattentive babysitter and her college aged son not noticing I was in the room
[0:43:53] <Finakala> Where did the other one even go
[0:43:59] <+SpoonlessAlakazam> etalEyerub hobbDab jermaNosewipe
[0:44:02] <%TheActuallyGuy> The game should switch to the clown fart soundtrack as punishment for dying.
[0:44:11] <homurau> i didn't even see it.
[0:44:11] <+Rivet95> Sneaky sneaky hunter
[0:44:11] <kingbaconcrispy> In remake they do.
[0:44:18] <Dhurkst> I like to play the classic Resis by systematically killing every enemy in every area as they become available, *then* doing the puzzles/progression.
[0:44:18] <AutechreTwinAphex> this game is still legit after all these years
[0:44:19] <dukenux> thats a spooky ass corridor
[0:44:24] <%StaceMcGate> BlessRNG
[0:44:26] <Froyuken> They crash through the windows in the REmake.

[0:44:33] <Fujiwara_92> Sniped
[0:44:33] <%trustycoyote> One of the early notes mentioned hairless apes i think. Is it implied that they became hunters? @AngriestPat
[0:44:33] <%starotter70> @TheActuallyGuy [Clown mode Unlocked]
[0:44:34] <Cerabret100> maaaybe save?
[0:44:34] <peachy996> REmake and RE1 melding together in your mind palace

[0:44:39] <Finakala> Are they truly the ultimate bioweapon
[0:44:40] <korpocalypse> dude I can't believe how scary this game is even with these ps1 graphics dude @AngriestPat
[0:44:43] <%BayowolfTerra> That is a lot of hunters

[0:44:55] <+LegendaryDorkKnight> dude you were so right about that sekiro discussion on the podcast
[0:44:56] <AutechreTwinAphex> @korpocalypse yeah it was legit something in 1996
[0:44:58] <+Rivet95> Who needs bioweapons when we can outfit soldiers with ACID rounds?
[0:44:59] <Dhurkst> @Finakala a weapon to surpass Metal Gear
[0:44:59] <Aydarkzero> good save room theme tripleCOMFY
[0:45:02] <reasonance> I thought RE was about zombos, not weird lizard monsters?
[0:45:03] <%StaceMcGate> @grimm_hatter they are not, just go big on channel emotes
[0:45:07] <Jack_DT> yes she can have her shoulder pads
[0:45:10] <theotherguy617> @grimm_hatter Don't believe so, just use 'em for some dumb shit
[0:45:11] <AzureHawk_Streams> Man, RE with fixed camera angles is the sh*t. Why did Capcom changed it in RE2 Remake?
[0:45:15] <rytisone> use Barry's code
[0:45:16] <%grimm_hatter> @stacemcgate shame
[0:45:17] <skinmansgds> The hunters are bioweapons

[0:45:33] <%QueequegTheater> @reasonance There have been dumb lizards in almost every single RE game
[0:45:37] <Blitzmafia> The ultimate bioweapon
[0:45:39] <+Rivet95> Bloodborne looks weird. Did you mod it?
[0:45:39] <TournamentArc> @AngriestPat Hey Pat, when you get to REmake are you gonna be playing GameCube REmake or PS4 REmake?
[0:45:40] <godzookylives> You gave him jaundice
[0:45:42] <%blondie_ow> @AngriestPat The door to the right is the one you use the code on
[0:45:44] <+LegendaryDorkKnight> jill calebGasm
[0:45:47] <+dustingunn> did pat stop dying and crashing
[0:45:48] <Ultimatefool> Looking back, I have no idea how Silent Hill didn't reach RE's popularity. It looked better, sounded scarier, had way more going on
[0:45:52] <%Theastrica> i don't remember there being this many hunters
[0:45:54] <@absolute_weapon> @AngriestPat I think if I recall hearing that every zombie you kill gets replaced with a zombie
[0:45:56] <rytisone> oh deer
[0:45:58] <%StaceMcGate> Save point soon?
[0:46:01] <Jane_Lo> @AzureHawk_Streams classic view and tank controlls kind of hated rn, so capcom even didn't made a bonus mod for it
[0:46:01] <%a_c_chirns> @dustingunn sort of
[0:46:03] <@absolute_weapon> I mean
[0:46:03] <@absolute_weapon> hunter
[0:46:05] <@absolute_weapon> shit
[0:46:07] <Finakala> SH1-4 are way better than RE1-4 imo
[0:46:10] <SilverFaustX> silent hill scared me as a kid
[0:46:12] <Rich_In_Antioxidants> You know Pat and energy drinks. It's only a matter of time before he crashes
[0:46:13] <%starotter70> Hwhere's Barry?
[0:46:17] <skinmansgds> This room in REmake threw me for a loop
[0:46:21] <Aydarkzero> it was a setup!

[0:50:13] <%valriot> I wanna play Hellblade, but new one being Xbox Sex exclusive puts me off
[0:50:15] <+Rivet95> Jill should give the magnum to Barry. He seems like the type of man who needs two magnums.

[0:50:35] <shandytowne> save would be a good idea, I agree with the chat monsters

[0:51:45] <%Guardiansaiyan> Thanks for the HahaBall @arfsm95 Really appreciate it!
[0:51:47] <Dhurkst> Chomping on a "living" zombo, huh?
[0:51:47] <+Rivet95> @MrHappyFunshine does that mean we're all zombies?
[0:51:50] <%grimm_hatter> that is a big hallway

[0:52:11] <%BurningLlama777> @Run44forrest As a treat!
[0:52:14] <MrHappyFunshine> @Rivet95 Of course
[0:52:15] <Rich_In_Antioxidants> Pat should Chew ass and kick gum
[0:52:16] <Froyuken> Don't remember this hallway.
[0:52:16] <ancrest_tant> We’re all zombies on the inside
[0:52:20] <%QueequegTheater> ZAMBABUMBO
[0:52:20] <dukenux> delicious
[0:52:21] <%StaceMcGate> Taking all bets now: Will Pat's next death will be by a hunter?
[0:52:22] <shandytowne> I love how you had a bird's eye view on how much you weren't aiming at the zombo but his head exploded anyway
[0:52:25] <skinmansgds> Zombies will eat each other if they get real hungry
[0:52:25] <Vordox> Red Heads?
[0:52:26] <Cerabret100> The fact that pat has less mind goblins about ammo conservation than me is more terrifying than any zombie
[0:52:26] <%abakkus> zombies can have little a jill, as a treat
[0:52:29] <%king_wragles> EXACTLY 60
[0:52:30] <%BurningLlama777> @Rich_In_Antioxidants And he's all out of ass.
[0:52:30] <%QueequegTheater> LUL
[0:52:32] <Finakala> @LegendaryDorkKnight I played through Dino Crisis 2 without a memory card at all. TWICE>
[0:52:34] <skinmansgds> they can even starve to death
[0:52:35] <%king_wragles> 59
[0:52:35] <indig0bird> Zombies can have a little salami
[0:52:37] <Run44forrest> 61 monkaS
[0:52:37] <%D33TR> man thats satisfying

[0:52:50] <+machshop> warning shot
[0:52:50] <$Bearjewpiter> apatSleep <- what that zombie is doing atm
[0:52:52] <flyingtentaclemonster> BAD END
[0:52:54] <+Scevda> I miss memory cards.
[0:52:59] <Aydarkzero> same
[0:53:07] <%StaceMcGate> @Scevda they were a total scam
[0:53:11] <shandytowne> apatBig shotgun boi
[0:53:14] <%NWR_James> There should be 63 total I think
[0:53:15] <Froyuken> Zombie with a shotgun.
[0:53:15] <%TOONFOOD> Why are shotguns always cool?
[0:53:15] <%Meidolaon> But will you have enough left for the bosses?
[0:53:18] <godzookylives> Do naked zombies respawn?
[0:53:19] <KingGoblodyte> Why no black zombies??
[0:53:22] <Jane_Lo> 20 save slots was never enough tbh in cards
[0:53:24] <+Scevda> But bringing your saves around were cool.
[0:53:26] <%a_c_chirns> Zombo with a shotgun
[0:53:29] <cureneckbeard> pattery
[0:53:30] <+Rivet95> Sure glad this mansion, that someone ELSE brought a bazooka to, is FILLED with grenades
[0:53:34] <%BurningLlama777> Really, if a game has a shotgun, you *should* be able to kill everything in that game with the shotgun.
[0:53:35] <%unclekulikov> But what if you run out of zombies?
[0:53:35] <%Albadabar> Man all these little boss fountains.... wonder what's coming?
[0:53:36] <bluebiscuit94> I gotta say, since I'm the kinda guy who doesn't really mind old looking games, this still looks like a janky but fun adventure, wish I had discovered RE way back when
[0:53:42] <%Jekado> @TOONFOOD the germans in WWI didn't think they were cool
[0:53:42] <skinmansgds> The only black zombies are in RE5
[0:53:42] <Froyuken> @Meidolaon He's got the mugnum for that problem.
[0:53:43] <DrkJP520> the shotgun is really powerful, especially against living things
[0:53:46] <%BurningLlama777> It's called the Remington Theory
[0:53:50] <skinmansgds> and Marvin that one time
[0:53:52] <%trustycoyote> Did anyone pick up that memory card expansion thinking it was a memory card only to find once you got home that NOPE no saving for you
[0:53:57] <dukenux> thats neat
[0:54:01] <Dhurkst> MASAKA
[0:54:02] <%king_wragles> 57
[0:54:07] <%QueequegTheater> I only like old-looking games if theylook old but in HD, like Octopath
[0:54:08] <%a_c_chirns> loving that shogun recoil
[0:54:09] <+Rivet95> Shotguns actually get a +30% crit multiplier against living things IRL
[0:54:10] <+LegendaryDorkKnight> do you ever stream not in your pjs? KappaHD
[0:54:12] <%Nina96> apatCrazyhead_RD
[0:54:13] <Froyuken> This is the Yawn fight in REmake.
[0:54:15] <%BurningLlama777> When you fire a shotgun it should sound like your whole body exploded, except it didn't.
[0:54:16] <dukenux> id forget theees an elevator in the courtyard by now
[0:54:16] <%StaceMcGate> Why are they throwing goblin type enemies this late in the game?
[0:54:17] <%Ganerumo> I just finished Black Mesa now that Xen is in. Holy fuck the effort they've put into the Xen levels is absurd, it's like a separate game
[0:54:19] <king_wragles> 56
[0:54:24] <AzureHawk_Streams> What was the problem?
[0:54:25] <DrkJP520> oooh this music
[0:54:31] <rytisone> petite lady with a shotgun
[0:54:32] <BoneofMalkav> I would miss memory cards if it weren't for the fact that the only official memory cards you could by held 8 megs of free space.
[0:54:32] <+generalve> this music is actually good
[0:54:33] <%QueequegTheater> bigmug
[0:54:33] <Froyuken> But that door is broken.
[0:54:35] <peachy996> This puzzle music
[0:54:36] <%blaggablag> Blating people's heads all casual like
[0:54:38] <+Rivet95> Mix your weed
[0:54:38] <%a_c_chirns> SourPls
[0:54:39] <+C24U> I wonder if it's actually possible to decapitate someone with a single shell from a standard issue shotgun
[0:54:39] <Run44forrest> people overstate the importance of saving ammo in resi. i finished with 117 pistol ammo and 40 shotgun because i was too scared to waste it
[0:54:42] <+generalve> except the clown farts
[0:54:48] <Finakala> I saw someone playing through Xen the other day and my god is it LONG
[0:54:48] <%grimm_hatter> the only unbelievable thing here is jill never gets covered in gore
[0:54:51] <%NWR_James> BIG MISS
[0:54:51] <%QueequegTheater> @C24U Define standard issue
[0:54:51] <dukenux> @ganerumo did they improve it over original
[0:54:53] <%TOONFOOD> @Jekado I don't know enough about WW1 but I bet they thought they were cool
[0:54:54] <PabuPanda> WASTED SHELL. RESET
[0:54:55] <+LegendaryDorkKnight> Jill is so fkn cool it's fun just to walk around KEKW
[0:54:59] <Aydarkzero> WHO could have done this
[0:55:00] <%BurningLlama777> @C24U Only one way to find out. I'll volunteer to be the first test subject.
[0:55:01] <Froyuken> So you have to enter from the 2nd floor.
[0:55:02] <%starotter70> For a sec, I thought the game crashed
[0:55:03] <+Pookiedaexzile> Did pat step on his own dick yet
[0:55:03] <+C24U> @QueequegTheater 12 gauge
[0:55:06] <+Rivet95> @C24U gonna depend on the round and the gauge.
[0:55:06] <bluebiscuit94> @QueequegTheater fair, but I honestly don't mind non HD games, comes with always have beem a cheapo gamer until very recently
[0:55:06] <shandytowne> shotgun b u l l e t s
[0:55:13] <BoneofMalkav> #HowCanThisBe?
[0:55:21] <Rich_In_Antioxidants> Who's ready for the eventual RE4 Remake?
[0:55:21] <Finakala> From what I could tell Xen is actually too long now, but Nihilinth and Gonads are way better bosses
[0:55:25] <+Punchasaur> Jelly Valentine. Cuz sandwich
[0:55:29] <Ultimatefool> @Run44forrest Yeah I feel like only RE3 is difficult with this if you want to kill Nemesis every time
[0:55:30] <skinmansgds> Wait, how did this newspaper get here, this is dated post mansion lockdown?
[0:55:33] <AzureHawk_Streams> @starotter70 you wish. We all do.
[0:55:35] <godzookylives> What state is Raccoon City set in?
[0:55:40] <%ThatOneGuyYouSaw> @Rich_In_Antioxidants it better be fixed camera
[0:55:42] <+LegendaryDorkKnight> calebFlexL calebFlexR
[0:55:45] <%ennui_on_me> a state of disaster
[0:55:51] <%Jekado> @TOONFOOD I could be wrong but it was the first time they were introduce in trench warfare and the americans use them and the germans called it barbaric and said it was a violation of war accords
[0:55:55] <Froyuken> @godzookylives Illinois.

[0:56:01] <+Flasktoss> These articles are from really recently in relation to when the game is taking place.
[0:56:05] <skinmansgds> Is this Wesker's newspaper?
[0:56:05] <%QueequegTheater> @C24U Unless it's a small child with osteoporosis at point blank, not without physics deciding to take a vacation.
[0:56:08] <%Mottyrob> In the mountains!
[0:56:10] <%starotter70> Ain't that wacky?
[0:56:10] <%blondie_ow> Monsters in Raccoon city? Bullshit.
[0:56:15] <dukenux> STAAARS.
[0:56:18] <%BurningLlama777> @Jekado Talking about shotguns or chlorine?
[0:56:19] <Finakala> Umbrella, BAD??
[0:56:20] <+Rivet95> Imagine if your local news paper reported "grotesque monsters" in the woods around your town
[0:56:24] <FairOnFire> is this directors cut or vanilla?
[0:56:26] <+LegendaryDorkKnight> the only monster I see is the one on stream Kappa
[0:56:28] <dukenux> Prime-evil forest?
[0:56:28] <AzureHawk_Streams> @ThatOneGuyYouSaw wouldn't that be ironic as f*ck.
[0:56:30] <%BurningLlama777> Ooh, a shotgun that shoots chlorine gas
[0:56:31] <%Albadabar> Big herbin
[0:56:32] <%Jekado> @BurningLlama777 shotguns
[0:56:34] <alwayspronking> When's Clown Basement?
[0:56:39] <%Guardiansaiyan> @Rivet95 video games don't fail me NOW
[0:56:41] <Rich_In_Antioxidants> Wesker sitting on the toilet reading Umbrella Times and checking UmbrellaBook
[0:56:42] <%starotter70> @FairOnFire Director's Cut, No Clown Farts tho
[0:56:48] <%trustycoyote> MO disk, MO problems...? EH?!
[0:56:48] <rhus> man, RE1 does have a lot of nice music outside of clown farts
[0:56:51] <skinmansgds> The paper boy is real good, he got his paper past the zombie quarantine
[0:56:52] <%SolidusRex> All we know is Raccoon City is in the Midwest
[0:56:54] <%QueequegTheater> @C24U It'll definitely demolish most of their head but the spine is way more resilient than you would think
[0:56:58] <%BurningLlama777> @Jekado What about a shotgun that shoots chlorine napalm barbed wire. 8)
[0:57:02] <%FirearmsInstructor> @AngriestPat Why does this tiny town have a paramilitary SWAT team? What was the population of Raccoon city as of this game?
[0:57:04] <%valriot> @angriestpat That file makes me want a RE spin off Forest style with all the fucked up failed Umbrella monsters
[0:57:04] <%Guardiansaiyan> Look at that ART WORK
[0:57:05] <+Punchasaur> Are the monsters just an allegory for the turbo raccoons from Toronto
[0:57:05] <FairOnFire> oic
[0:57:10] <Finakala> WHAT a MANSION
[0:57:10] <%Jekado> @TOONFOOD don't be mistaken i do find shottys cool most games with gun setups i go with a Shotty p90 combo if able
[0:57:12] <Froyuken> Is this room in REmake?
[0:57:14] <%StaceMcGate> nooooo
[0:57:17] <$insaneintentionsyo> Brad
[0:57:20] <%BurningLlama777> Raccoons are cute but trash is not good food.
[0:57:20] <%TOONFOOD> @Jekado That sounds like a pretty cool ass weapon to me. for real though that's super interesting cheers for the info :)
[0:57:21] <%ThatOneGuyYouSaw> why doesn't anyone have a cell phone?
[0:57:25] <kingbaconcrispy> @FirearmsInstructor 500,000
[0:57:27] <%QueequegTheater> @AngriestPat Raccoon City is Rahm Emanuel's Chicago, prove me wrong
[0:57:30] <rytisone> other door
[0:57:31] <+redakted> i thot it was in the tiger head
[0:57:31] <+TeamAMFer> @FirearmsInstructor did you know you can play online RE Outbreak? The fans are keeping it alive with a site and emulators, and no bad loading times
[0:57:32] <%BurningLlama777> You shouldn't eat trash. *chugs Diet Coke*
[0:57:33] <Ultimatefool> Did Pat get to "Oh my CODDD" yet?
[0:57:33] <%Guardiansaiyan> @Punchasaur replace racoons with employees
[0:57:33] <Run44forrest> feed raccoons :)
[0:57:35] <%blondie_ow> I think you got to move the statues into certain positions
[0:57:37] <kingbaconcrispy> The mo disk is not far.
[0:57:38] <+redakted> no thats remake
[0:57:38] <+Rivet95> Cell phones weren't cool in the 1990s.
[0:57:40] <Finakala> People had cellphones in the mid 90s?
[0:57:40] <godzookylives> In the library
[0:57:44] <%walternatorz> you needed to check the other other secret door
[0:57:48] <dukenux> libraby
[0:57:51] <%BurningLlama777> @Run44forrest Seconded. Feed raccoons nutritious foods
[0:57:53] <+generalve> Hey pat i got a new mintor HOLY SHIT 144FPS is the best you were right !
[0:57:56] <kingbaconcrispy> There's a secret wall somewhere

[0:58:02] <+Punchasaur> @guardiansaiyan turbo employees?
[0:58:03] <shandytowne> 144 is the shit
[0:58:05] <BoneofMalkav> Gotta get Mo Disks
[0:58:07] <%StaceMcGate> @Finakala We've had cellphones since the 80s, they were about 10x the size of standard ones
[0:58:08] <%BurningLlama777> Train the raccoons to bring you spare change.
[0:58:08] <%QueequegTheater> @ThatOneGuyYouSaw It takes place in the mid 90s
[0:58:08] <Froyuken> Cell phones were thousands of dollars in the 90s.\
[0:58:13] <+thehoboacrossts> SourPls
[0:58:13] <%SolidusRex> The book depository
[0:58:19] <%QueequegTheater> Mo Money Mo Disks
[0:58:22] <%trustycoyote> @generalve Similar scenario for me as well. Hot damn is 144 Hz amazin
[0:58:24] <%FirearmsInstructor> @AngriestPat Seriously? With multiplayer online? I was so upset when they took down the servers. ;(
[0:58:25] <Run44forrest> @BurningLlama777 RaccAttack Clap
[0:58:28] <Froyuken> Lot more library in RE OG than in REmake.
[0:58:29] <%ThatOneGuyYouSaw> @QueequegTheater yes
[0:58:32] <+Rivet95> I can't imagine you'd get much reception in a forested mountain area in the 90s as a cop
[0:58:32] <%Jekado> @TOONFOOD the problem was shotguns in trench fighting were too effective. but thats the problem with war... its like machine guns eliminated line battles as it was stupid. Shotguns now are nothing compared to Tatical UAVs now.
[0:58:33] <Finakala> I didn't get a cellphone until around 98-99 and it was a goddamn brick
[0:58:45] <%JonesMcFly> apatLiz
[0:58:55] <Ner234> Seeeeecret
[0:58:55] <Froyuken> That texture warping.
[0:58:56] <%BurningLlama777> People probably drop thousands of $ of belongings a day. They could be yours, with raccoons
[0:58:57] <Rich_In_Antioxidants> She can push a solid stone statue with one arm
[0:58:59] <%MegboyManuel> man push puzzles and the 90's

[0:59:13] <%BurningLlama777> It's not stealing if they never would have found their stuff.
[0:59:15] <%blaggablag> But how could one invest in such racoon related ventures?
[0:59:15] <Ultimatefool> Damn it chat
[0:59:16] <ancrest_tant> I was so good at snake on my little Nokia
[0:59:16] <OlavOlavsson> does MO actually stand for something
[0:59:18] <%QueequegTheater> @ThatOneGuyYouSaw Also the chief of police is a serial killing asshole so he probably cheaped out on the phone budget
[0:59:21] <%starotter70> Wow

[0:59:31] <+Rivet95> Leave mansion, run home. Roll credits.
[0:59:33] <kazadog> Mega Orb
[0:59:34] <%ThatOneGuyYouSaw> @QueequegTheater that is definitely possible

[0:59:37] <bluebiscuit94> @BurningLlama777 so the Harvest stand, but with racoons?
[0:59:38] <%Albadabar> Mental Organism Designed Only for Disk
[0:59:41] <%BurningLlama777> @blaggablag I mean, given how much produces grocery stores throw out, a little dumpster diving could pay off big.
[0:59:46] <Froyuken> Does that elevator even work?

[1:06:45] <%ThatOneGuyYouSaw> what about revelations 1?
[1:06:47] <%StaceMcGate> RE1 Remake no good?
[1:06:48] <$Dakuu75> I'm looking forward to RE3 remake more than FFVII honestly
[1:06:50] <%Alpha8087> sat Is the RE3make gonna be the same camera style as the 2 Remake?
[1:06:52] <BoneofMalkav> Nemesis in Re3make is gonna be insane.
[1:06:54] <%BurningLlama777> I'm an expensive date
[1:06:55] <PurePlatinumKyo> I always loved just how much more dangerous Hunters are compared to Lickers in RE2, Lickers feel like such pushovers by comparison
[1:06:56] <Rich_In_Antioxidants> Crystal Skull Vodka

[1:06:58] <TheMasterOfWhatever> Hey @angriestpat who would win in a fight Mr.X or that big glass eye guy from RE4?
[1:06:59] <tripessolides> rev1 is aight pat
[1:07:00] <iamnotaparrot> revelations 1 is good pat. fuck you
[1:07:01] <DrkJP520> @angriestpat i hope they'll be invisible
[1:07:01] <Run44forrest> i put like 130 hours into resi revelaitons on 3ds
[1:07:02] <%QueequegTheater> I hope R3Make replaces the Hunters with SoulsBorne NPC invasions like Maldron
[1:07:05] <skinmansgds> I hope you can knock hunters out of the air
[1:07:05] <lionandfox21> I thought it was Hunters Beta? You know the weird poison type in the hospital?
[1:07:06] <ancrest_tant> Remember kids, point your guns at nothing to ensure you’re safe
[1:07:07] <%BoboDaHobo> These sound effects keep making me think I'm getting steam notifications
[1:07:07] <%starotter70> Wow
[1:07:09] <+Rivet95> Did revelations have hunters? Wasn't it dumb non-zombies?
[1:07:10] <+WarbossMetal> Revelations 1 was good tho... just not on 3DS
[1:07:11] <Froyuken> @dustingunn It's not really a bad puzzle. Just that it's kinda obtuse if you didn't explore around the area the first time.
[1:07:12] <$Dakuu75> @Alpha8087 yeah, it'll be third person like RE2 remake
[1:07:12] <%BeefyQueefer> i hope they remake RE4 with tank controls
[1:07:14] <%BurningLlama777> I'm the reason that candy packages these days say "For fuck's sake this candy is TO SHARE"
[1:07:16] <phatballlz54> i like Rev1 better than Rev2
[1:07:18] <Vordox> Resident Evil Outbreak <3
[1:07:19] <%kewlmyc> LUL
[1:07:20] <Graxe_> RE4 does have tank controls
[1:07:20] <%blondie_ow> Guy?
[1:07:21] <tigerfang86> if ONLY IT WAS
[1:07:22] <%MakotoPB> @burningllama777 be careful with that tendon. I ruptured mine 3 years ago and still hurts
[1:07:23] <+Punchasaur> Fuck you my opinion is right BabyRage
[1:07:23] <+Sartastic> zombo whale

[1:07:28] <Rich_In_Antioxidants> Code Veronica remake when?
[1:07:28] <tigerfang86> ONE guy?
[1:07:29] <Tracazoid> Don't you love playing as Jackass and Grinder fighting Invisible Hunters in the snow?
[1:07:30] <%Jekado> NEW RE remake will have something really scarry like Student Debt or Unpaid Morgage payments
[1:07:30] <+generalve> Hey pat you think Arachnophobia is going overload for RE3make ?
[1:07:30] <lotharrio> So should we use "Three-make" for RE3's remake, or for the RE1 re-remake?
[1:07:32] <%Captain_Joe1911> :D
[1:07:32] <Ultimatefool> Did...Pat just go through all that to put a battery into an elevator to just loop back before the bridge???
[1:07:34] <+Jimboq> what guy? rev1
[1:07:36] <+WarbossMetal> Thats Rev 2
[1:07:36] <%trustycoyote> wtf?!

[1:07:48] <SomersaultJustice> that's with the guy that does the axe bomber right?
[1:07:51] <+Rivet95> RE Threemake sounds dope
[1:07:51] <AdmiralButtloaf> no comment on crank noise pat?
[1:07:51] <%ThatOneGuyYouSaw> what was the list of games he was going to get through again?
[1:07:51] <Neo_Kaiser> Don't you mean Revalaitons?
[1:07:53] <%QueequegTheater> @AngriestPat Unlike The Last Jedi, there is NO argument that Rev 1 is good
[1:07:57] <theangryguyofde> the last boss in rev 1 was awful NotLikeThis
[1:07:57] <SilverFaustX> dog.mp3
[1:07:58] <+Caped_Eggy> You mean golems from parasite eve 2?
[1:07:58] <AzureHawk_Streams> @BeefyQueefer isn't it already tank controls? Or is my sarcasm detector broken?
[1:08:01] <+dustingunn> Rev1 was really impressive for 3DS
[1:08:02] <+Sartastic> kukri guy was cool
[1:08:03] <%TOONFOOD> Someone give that dog a treat
[1:08:04] <%BurningLlama777> @MakotoPB I'm so sorry to hear that. :( That kind of chronic pain isn't fair. Bodies should be better at healing, goddammit
[1:08:04] <+thackattack00> @ThatOneGuyYouSaw Schedule <<<<<<<<<<<<<<<< Current plans for the near future are a full run of all the mainline Resident Evil games, in order. That's RE1, RE2, RE3, RE-CVX, REmake, RE-Zero, RE4, RE5, RE-REV, RE6, RE-REV2, RE7, RE2R, and then finally Resident Evil 3 Remake in April. Might not make em all and cause the games are short exact dates may be a little off.
[1:08:05] <Run44forrest> whats her face was hot tho
[1:08:05] <flyingtentaclemonster> I rather they make cvx good
[1:08:06] <%trustycoyote> That doesn't even sound like a game
[1:08:07] <tripessolides> let's forget about the invisible enemies in re4 and rev2
[1:08:08] <%Theastrica> lol revalaitons
[1:08:13] <Frostydough1> @AngriestPat are you doing all 3 scenarios for RE 6?
[1:08:13] <%weissguard> "Don't worry Chris! Me and my sweet ass are on the way!" - That one character from RE Revelations 1

[1:24:01] <%ThatOneGuyYouSaw> @AngriestPat I don't see RE Resistance (or whatever it's called) in your schedule.
[1:24:03] <%MakotoPB> Don't forget to superman that ho after
[1:24:04] <%QueequegTheater> @AngriestPat hundreds of pulleys
[1:24:04] <+necrocannibal2> the more I think about it, the more it makes sense

[1:24:07] <weizamaleza> Thats some fucking strong ass lever
[1:24:07] <theKingRamses> tiny mouse running in a wheel to rotate the walls
[1:24:11] <lionandfox21> The logistics of this are gnarly
[1:24:11] <%BurningLlama777> Oh yeah... that's a lot of stone to move.
[1:24:11] <+Sartastic> she's rly strong
[1:24:12] <RocketShot_> @drkjp520 is that supposed to be the cranking sound?
[1:24:13] <%xcompleasedad> Hydraulics
[1:24:13] <%SoFarFetched> Maybe it's the snakes slowly turning the hall for her
[1:24:14] <DavidSanChan> it's like I'm back down the well in sh2
[1:24:15] <%vectorless_peon> Its magic
[1:24:16] <%Conyst> now you just need the Larry-disc and the Shemp-disc
[1:24:16] <+dustingunn> it's like that hallway set they did for inception
[1:24:16] <skinmansgds> Are we in a metal tube?
[1:24:18] <+Rivet95> The mechanism for rotating a section of wall by HAND CRANK?

[1:24:21] <peachy996> nanomachines
[1:24:22] <Aydarkzero> Jill "Swole" Valentine
[1:24:24] <godzookylives> she's rotating the entire planet duh
[1:24:24] <rytisone> plot twist: you actually spin the world around
[1:24:25] <%skizzuto> it's doable with a shit-ton of gears and pulleys
[1:24:26] <%ThatOneGuyYouSaw> why didn't Jill just jump the distance?
[1:24:26] <PabuPanda> It's obviously the work of an enemy Stand
[1:24:27] <%Albadabar> Jill is extremely powerful, especially against living things
[1:24:29] <%walternatorz> it's in a planetary gear system?
[1:24:30] <%goose_attack_almanac> The Pulley system in this place is nuts
[1:24:31] <peachy996> Chiral Crystals
[1:24:32] <Daxalog> Turning a machine that does all the heavy lifting on the other side. Or being in S T A R S makes you a super human
[1:24:32] <+dheng1> Jill is buff
[1:24:33] <Froyuken> @Conyst Gud one.

[1:25:16] <%BurningLlama777> Huh??
[1:25:17] <$draugrix> how dose it spin? why dose it spin? who made it spin?
[1:25:17] <%MakotoPB> Japanese had karakuri mansions where sections can rotate to reveal entrance to other rooms. this I think is just padding for time
[1:25:18] <%FirearmsInstructor> @AngriestPat It's a giant gear rotating a cylindrical tumbler as you turn the crank. (Like a key in a lock) It's PRETTY DUMB
[1:25:20] <%Jekado> its like a trap from deception
[1:25:20] <%blondie_ow> ER-EEE. ER-EEE. ER-EEE.

[1:29:38] <%ClaudeMcGarren> @lionandfox21 what are you talking about lol
[1:29:39] <%QueequegTheater> I bet RE2 will get playable Vergil before DMCV does

[1:30:48] <feralady> do they do more damage bc its so uncomfortable to see them naked
[1:30:49] <%chill_o_wisp> lol they ripped of zelda /s
[1:30:50] <Rich_In_Antioxidants> if this were a porn game the naked zombies would just fuck

[1:31:11] <%QueequegTheater> @AngriestPat But hollows are supposed to be weaker Kappa
[1:31:12] <%AceDet0x> extra defense from being naked
[1:31:13] <+Shadowpint> The original version of this track is spookier than REmake's in my opinion
[1:31:13] <+Rivet95> That's because these zombies have a MAGNUM dong instead of the weak ass 9mm
[1:31:14] <+Basilias_Maximus> I see. Nudity makes you stronger!
[1:31:20] <Rich_In_Antioxidants> with their maggot infested semen
[1:31:21] <officerodoherty> @Sphincter_Spelunker yeah he plays a main character i think!

[1:39:16] <kazadog> stop lying pat
[1:39:18] <rhus> but not sinatra
[1:39:18] <%radda343> why did they even replace it all with that crook's music

[1:39:19] <romanticzomedy> metallica was never great

[1:39:21] <%Hiro01231> tes
[1:39:24] <officerodoherty> @SomeSageAdvice exactly, so you're totally justified in wearing them indoors
[1:39:24] <+toilet_chan> music existed 30 years ago?!?!
[1:39:25] <%IMDRanged> Even the Clown Farting in the basement music?
[1:39:27] <%BayowolfTerra> Albert"Double parks in a handicap spot"Wesker

[1:39:35] <2midgetsinacoat> 30 year old music? it must've aged like milk
[1:39:36] <fruit_pie_the_magician> Fucking Megaman music and sonic music is great
[1:39:37] <cureneckbeard> music existed 30 years ago but it was black andw hite
[1:39:37] <+spadoinkle> Music is either the first to age, or become timeless.
[1:39:39] <rytisone> I wonder if RE3 Remake will have original OST option, since no deluxe edition
[1:39:40] <NaturalGear> with every passing year music becomes better and better
[1:39:40] <dullvivid> @dullvivid is new here. Say hello! HeyGuys
[1:39:40] <DrkJP520> people were alive back then?!
[1:39:41] <+Order_of_Mystery> i too love The Ink Spots
[1:39:41] <%blondie_ow> The 70's had good music
[1:39:41] <rcand9> whos bach?
[1:39:41] <ancrest_tant> Good music will always sound good
[1:39:42] <$RetroCop87> okay millenialoomer
[1:39:42] <FairOnFire> only boomers listen to music from more than 5 years ago
[1:39:45] <AxelCezar> good musicis forever, and art too, and even games and books. Who would have thought that good shit last?
[1:39:45] <jetboots> 1980 was 40 years ago
[1:39:45] <%BurningLlama777> Tiny Tim's music is forever.
[1:39:45] <%Hiro01231> it doesn't become bad because of time, music is unaging
[1:39:46] <elspiceweasel> dinosaurs didn't play music pat
[1:39:46] <$DeeJayOkay> 30 years ago was 1989. #ExistentialDreadIncoming @AngriestPat
[1:39:46] <peachy996> Good music in the 80s?
[1:39:47] <Arkhamman367> That's a long time ago
[1:39:51] <lexitheshark> 40 years ago was 1979. Tons of good music from then @AngriestPat
[1:39:51] <$insaneintentionsyo> bawkBruh
[1:39:51] <%DatGuyJimbo> boomer music
[1:39:51] <+spadoinkle> Never really inbetween.

[1:39:52] <+Punchasaur> Y-Y-Yeah wow!
[1:39:52] <+Pyr0_Fr0st> So 1989?
[1:39:55] <SilverFaustX> all music from the last 10 years is shit

[1:39:57] <%Jekado> rocks banging against each other is pretty sick bro
[1:39:58] <%QueequegTheater> @AngriestPat There are these guys, pretty obscure. They're called Led Zeppelin
[1:39:58] <+Pookiedaexzile> The 80s where 40 years ago
[1:39:59] <Spyder1246> RE3 better have original music option
[1:40:01] <$RealThiele> pileup

[1:40:11] <%gespenst25> is this the game with the farting clown basement?
[1:40:11] <Spyder1246> RE3 Mercenaries had awesome music
[1:40:12] <%ThatOneGuyYouSaw> auto-aim is for losers
[1:40:14] <+houseofnonsense> Are the zombos in RE3 the most aggressive of the classic REs?
[1:40:15] <%BurningLlama777> o/` I just go my way / Living every day o/`
[1:40:16] <disister1201> A couple of tracks here and there are kinda bad but the soundtracks for the classic games are super good
[1:40:18] <Ultimatefool> @Pookiedaexzile Please stop, I can only suddenly age so much

[1:40:31] <RocketShot_> Pat is boomber
[1:40:31] <+necrocannibal2> @gespenst25 nope, that's the Dual Shock Edition, this is the Director's Cut
[1:40:32] <Spyder1246> Yeah & RE3 zombies randomized their behavior
[1:40:34] <+Chopper3k> Classical music doesn't sound good?
[1:40:34] <%BurningLlama777> @Arweynn It's lichen
[1:40:38] <%takiyami> You know that 1990 will soon be what you're referring to when you say 30 years ago, right? DON'T LET IT SET IN

[2:29:45] <Arkhamman367> The reason why paige hate bagels is because she can't put mustard on it

[2:31:18] <+necrocannibal2> Paige is right about bagels
[2:31:22] <%BayowolfTerra> So its totally a soft food thing, isnt it?
[2:31:22] <%BurningLlama777> Wanna cut a bagel in half, butter each half, and toast them golden brown on a skillet.
[2:31:23] <$Dakuu75> they're obviously just actors, paid to ACT like a couple on stream but, actually hate each other
[2:31:25] <2j_hunter> bagels?!
[2:31:27] <%BurningLlama777> #skillet
[2:31:32] <leinadtonu> Hello chat, how's it hanging?
[2:31:35] <%BurningLlama777> @2j_hunter Fuck yeah bagels
[2:31:35] <+necrocannibal2> soggy cereal can fuck off
[2:31:36] <Run44forrest> i have never had a bagel. they sound like shitty donuts
[2:31:37] <%starotter70> Paige has never been more wrong
[2:31:45] <+Remery_> oh yea and soggy cereal
[2:31:46] <%BurningLlama777> @leinadtonu Pretty good how're you
[2:31:47] <%rumtumtugnutz> So they're fucking now cause of the bagel argument?
[2:31:49] <Redblood801> @BurningLlama777 I just left my job yesterday. I worked so hard to get it, but the stress and the workload was just too much.
[2:31:51] <Run44forrest> some cereal is good soggy
[2:31:54] <FriendlyCheer> Paige thinks bagels are the most disgusting food known to man.
[2:31:55] <+Punchasaur> Paige said you have to poke holes in the pancake for it to hold syrup... but that just makes it a shitty waffle
[2:31:57] <DavidSanChan> Pat and his bowl filling pee breaks
[2:32:08] <2j_hunter> i want a bagel now then
[2:32:12] <Arkhamman367> i'm so serious that her stance on bagels hurt me to my core
[2:32:15] <+Remery_> Waffles are best girl
[2:32:18] <Arek_1> @Teyaric You mean like MultiTwitch?
[2:32:25] <vvitchguy> Cinnamon Toast Crunch is great soggy.

[2:32:29] <bear_breaker20> so who else is gonna turn heel and defend soggy cereal?
[2:32:31] <%BurningLlama777> @Redblood801 For what it's worth, I sympathize with you. I got dumped from a promising paralegal job because I got deemed not good enough.
[2:32:33] <$Dakuu75> yeah, they don't use condoms. they can't get their rocks off unless its through a bagel hole
[2:32:33] <lilmac64> Bagel's aren't supposed to be like donuts my dude. They're just slightly more fancy bread. It's about the spreads you use.
[2:32:37] <Arkhamman367> this is why you don't meet your heros
[2:32:39] <TheArrow_> was paige just never t aught how to eat
[2:32:42] <SpellCatty> I missed it did they touch on donuts vs bagels? Are chocolate donuts worse than bagels in terms of "reminds me of buttstuff"?
[2:32:43] <+generalve> @Redblood801 sucks to hear about that. i wake up every morning getting pissed offf i have to go to work cause thats how much mine is drving me insane
[2:32:45] <leinadtonu> @burningllama777 just chilling. thx 4 asking :)

[2:45:25] <$JamJamX3> @AngriestPat They said that R3make is gonna be less faithful to the original than RE2 remake was. So they may change how all the Nemmy fights will go, and the new OTS camera view might help.

[3:18:45] <%legendscar01> Nice
[3:18:46] <kougane> Wait, why?
[3:18:49] <Mexrage> i would asume nemesis is the one that broke those walls on the shower on REmake 2
[3:18:50] <+DiabloDeAzul> is that an RE3 reference?
[3:18:53] <Tracazoid> I can't wait for Nemesis to break through that shower wall
[3:18:54] <DashXero> @XeroSigmaPrime They did? I can't remember anything like that.
[3:18:55] <$Dakuu75> to show how the licker got in?
[3:18:55] <AutechreTwinAphex> guess nothing for RE3 was planned out in advance

[3:19:22] <%chronotriggerhappy123> STARS man doesnt like that window
[3:19:23] <%DesuDesuDokiDoki> spooped
[3:19:30] <DashXero> @XeroSigmaPrime They mentioned his criminal history in the remake?
[3:19:31] <cureneckbeard> I'm not sure Nemesis has a dick
[3:19:32] <Ion_Laser> @NovaKnightmare Yeah. Brad

[3:19:33] <%BurningLlama777> o/` music o/`
[3:19:36] <$insaneintentionsyo> Nemesis uses tentacles
[3:19:36] <+MrAtheGreat> I came just in time for the best Resident Evil game... Why does it look so hideous? Is this a mod?
[3:19:37] <Run44forrest> chat.... blueberries or blackberries?
[3:19:42] <$Blackgaver> bip!
[3:19:43] <%XeroSigmaPrime> @DashXero File in his office describes him saying he nearly came from gutting open a pig. He described the pig as pale and 5'3". The pig obviously wasnt a pig.
[3:19:43] <%DesuDesuDokiDoki> nemesis FUCKS HARD
[3:19:43] <+heroicspiritavenger> @novaknightmare what do you think the tentacles are for?
[3:19:44] <%TheQButton> Blue
[3:19:44] <officerodoherty> @Run44forrest blackberries
[3:19:46] <%allanmiri> Nemesis fucks hard. That's what the tentacles are for
[3:19:47] <Desertfishing> neither
[3:19:51] <%Jekado> same neither
[3:19:52] <%XeroSigmaPrime> @DashXero Oh no, not his criminal history
[3:19:52] <breakerdsx> Sub 2 hour run?
[3:19:56] <$Blackgaver> it opens the spade door!
[3:19:57] <%Jekado> too tart for me
[3:19:58] <AutechreTwinAphex> I'm kinda disappointed that they haven't added stuff to RE2 Remake to 'finish it' - the Zapper stuff, more meaningful differences in Route B
[3:20:00] <%BurningLlama777> I used this song in a PowerPoint presentation in school one time. I don't even remember what the subject was.
[3:20:00] <tUxUt> what the hell is in that orange mug? tomatoDisgust

[3:20:07] <$Dakuu75> this place is empty-as-fuck. it's funn how much the police station looks used and lived in, in the remake. beds and furniture everywhere
[3:20:08] <$Blackgaver> 30 hours Kappa
[3:20:11] <$Blackgaver> counting deaths.
[3:20:12] <%Malchiah_Tenabre> Back to back? Did I miss RE1? I DID DAMNIT!
[3:20:13] <DashXero> @XeroSigmaPrime I remember the "pig."
[3:20:13] <%BurningLlama777> Something that a high schooler thought was related I guess.
[3:20:14] <majindusto> The "Lancer" Key
[3:20:15] <%smugjorgen98> I believe nemesis fucks
[3:20:16] <+Cityscape17> Hey pat, is the game easier to play in this hd mode or easier in the normal version?

[3:20:29] <%Guardiansaiyan> @Dakuu75 truth! The place here looks empty
[3:20:32] <%legendscar01> Nemesis the brad pretty hard
[3:20:35] <Fujiwara_92> But are you doing Leon B?
[3:20:40] <%Meidolaon> I forgot how much stuff was rearranged for RE2Make
[3:20:44] <%BurningLlama777> Anybody remember being in school and doing a group project with a friend, coming up with the stupidest ideas ever and going "THAT IS SO COOOOOL"
[3:20:45] <$Blackgaver> HIGH VOLTAGE!
[3:20:46] <santystuffs> iirc OG RE2 even if you paused the game the timer would go-on
[3:20:48] <officerodoherty> @Fujiwara_92 yes, i believe he aid he would
[3:20:52] <%DesuDesuDokiDoki> CRANKY BOIZ
[3:20:53] <extradopeness> Dude that crash last night killed my soul man
[3:20:54] <%Guardiansaiyan> @Fujiwara_92 probably tomorrow since he is doing Claire A right now
[3:20:55] <+Trair> Is this a texture mod? There’s no way the game looked this good
[3:21:01] <tripessolides> yes
[3:21:02] <+Jolnir> Hey pick up that file
[3:21:04] <%thebeargoesHONK> why play the old versions instead of the new ones?

[3:21:10] <Fujiwara_92> Cool thanks chat

[3:21:10] <extradopeness> Yeah big mods

[3:21:11] <+MrAtheGreat> Claire a/ leon B canon run?
[3:21:13] <%42nfl19> @AngriestPat since you are more confident with RE2, will you do both runs?
[3:21:16] <$Sphincter_Spelunker> @thebeargoesHONK release order
[3:21:18] <AutechreTwinAphex> yeah RE2 Remake they struck a very good balance between respecting the original vision of the environments and then rearranging them so they make sense as a 3D space
[3:21:22] <%Guardiansaiyan> @arcaderabbit48 he won the game
[3:21:23] <peachy996> That Crash during the song always put me on edge
[3:21:23] <%XeroSigmaPrime> @thebeargoesHONK Old versions are fucking amazing
[3:21:24] <Ion_Laser> @arcaderabbit48 Pat beat the game earlier
[3:21:25] <tripessolides> DEVELOP THE PICTURE I WANNA SEE BEST GIRL

[3:25:16] <+LegendaryDorkKnight> Ada ain't worth your time, Leon just bang my sister Claire!
[3:25:17] <extradopeness> Why are blueberries not actually blue?

[3:25:37] <$Sphincter_Spelunker> @DesuDesuDokiDoki I did NOT hear that one before. fuck
[3:25:38] <extradopeness> They should call them purple berries

[3:26:18] <cheezbass> that is not the best way to fall down
[3:26:20] <santystuffs> Chris doesnt know what sex is
[3:26:21] <ManfredA> it's weird seeing how different the lighting is in the original compared to RE2make
[3:26:21] <$Dakuu75> @dreu81 I think it sounds fine. if it sounds wonky on your end it might be twitch
[3:26:23] <Rostichenburg> Ada is a legit war criminal who should be hanged
[3:26:26] <SilverJakler> Yo Pat do you have any interest in trying out the Zero Escape games? Just recently got into them and they're reeeeeal good.

[3:28:20] <Mexrage> have been watching so much runs of classic RE of no damage, that seeing pat getting hit, freak me out xD
[3:28:24] <breakerdsx> Because Racoon City is a cheap piece of shit
[3:28:31] <%Ganerumo> That little bell tone in the police department reminds me of the Room theme
[3:28:33] <kingbaconcrispy> @Dakuu75 Umbrella for when it's time to kill everyone.
[3:28:40] <santystuffs> @Dakuu75 the mayor most likely, and I mean, better to repurpose a building than making one from scratch, it's for sure cheaper
[3:28:40] <+Reizie_Etherealm> Dumb people propose, dumber people approve the proposal
[3:28:41] <Fujiwara_92> Bit
[3:28:42] <Neo_Kaiser> That stacking puzzle was easy

[3:29:05] <slekotv> I think the cheif maybe slightly evil
[3:29:07] <%SoFarFetched> I guess Chief Irons was ...DEAD set on getting it.
[3:29:07] <+heroicspiritavenger> Sometimes you just gotta reuse architecture

[3:29:12] <ManfredA> He seems alright :)
[3:29:14] <santystuffs> Yea as I said, repurposing a building is for sure something cheaper and I could see people doing
[3:29:17] <+LegendaryDorkKnight> Please Claire no more cats
[3:29:22] <star_feline> Guro fanatic DansGame
[3:29:23] <%BurningLlama777> Is there any difference between town halls and banks?

[3:29:26] <TalisKanju> Let me put a ruby in this here painting...
[3:29:29] <%BurningLlama777> Same people run both buildings.
[3:29:30] <%Valdorick> Police Cheif Irons just wants a quiet life.

[3:29:48] <Finaldragoon> have you ever used the bow gun even though it's a trashfire?
[3:29:48] <xeros720> "why anyone would consider that art is beyond comprehension"
[3:29:49] <breakerdsx> Are saying Chief Irons did nothing wrong?
[3:29:50] <$insaneintentionsyo> insane120Skelegasm
[3:29:50] <Thenuclearwalrus> I think we're being a bit hasty, nothing wrong with a bit of guro, Im sure Chief Irons is a nice guy
[3:29:51] <extradopeness> I got a BONER
[3:29:51] <Rostichenburg> Re-purposing is fine why are they still using all the puzzle rooms and hidden compartments for police work?
[3:29:53] <+MrAtheGreat> Oddly enough, the best thing aboput this mod for me is the text. So sharp!
[3:29:54] <santystuffs> It's okay Pat, once you reach RE3 you'll get the godlike quickturn mechanic
[3:29:56] <%DesuDesuDokiDoki> chief irons: "hentai is an artform"
[3:29:57] <%TheQButton> Chief Irons kinda always felt like a fuckin Silent Hill character to me.
[3:29:58] <Fujiwara_92> Thats ok pat

[3:30:33] <ManfredA> Chief Irons stands out in a series full of psychopaths as the biggest creepo
[3:30:36] <Scatter0> CVX is underrated imo
[3:30:41] <santystuffs> Actually in OG RE2, Irons and Sherry don't interact AT ALL
[3:30:46] <santystuffs> It's amazing

[3:40:07] <santystuffs> Pat is one of my people! I never understood why people liked 1 over 2, It's way better imo
[3:40:09] <%Niney_Who> I legit once ate like 4 Einstein Bros Bagels in one day. Blueberry, Cinnamon Raisin, Everything, and Parmesan Onion. They're so good.
[3:40:10] <+AngelYoumou> @Dakuu75 He said Re2 OG and Remake are tied

[3:55:02] <%DesuDesuDokiDoki> is it possible to compliment somebody's skin without sounding like a serial killer? I think not
[3:55:03] <%Zaphire_Saucypants> alone...with the body, please.
[3:55:03] <GypsySquid> He's much easier to hate in the remake.
[3:55:04] <TalisKanju> I would like to be ALONE with this BODY
[3:55:04] <Run44forrest> hahaha thats a good one irons

[3:55:06] <deafmutelaughing> no Paige this guy is definitely a great person

[3:55:09] <+MisterCrimson> He totally jerked off on that corpse
[3:55:10] <%Zaxshimysham> Chief "taxidermy hype" Irons
[3:55:10] <%arcaderabbit48> Irons' voice acting is actually really good. Really sells that "creepy monster who kills and fucks ladies"
[3:55:13] <%TheQButton> He is a pretty bad guy.
[3:55:14] <peachy996> "And to think I used to enjoy Bagels"
[3:55:16] <+Remery_> alone to jerk
[3:55:16] <%imadoc91> He definitely fucked that body.

[3:55:33] <Flyrant> that wasn't an easter egg pat
[3:55:37] <AutechreTwinAphex> nah I don't think Iron's voice actor is very good here - more like stereotypical British accent that a lot of these games went for
[3:55:37] <McAngrimStein> yeah she's so dumb that it totally worked
[3:55:37] <$Sphincter_Spelunker> that's pretty dumb for a 12 year old
[3:55:37] <%GeneralSCPatton> FOOL, MR X CAN EASILY SUPLEX A TIGER
[3:55:37] <%ThatOneGuyYouSaw> did you know that Wesker has a hard on like you wouldn't believe?

[3:55:47] <+Fill783> Did he imply that he was planning on taxidermizing the girl?
[3:55:49] <@commanderclaw> She's 1 year older than Pat
[3:55:49] <%Zaphire_Saucypants> saaaaafe nooooow

[3:56:10] <hlreiku> k thanks
[3:56:11] <%blondie_ow> This is what the remake lacked. Interactions between Claire and Leon. They both have radios but only use them to talk to Marvin.
[3:56:12] <+nathandiel> Hair grows sideays
[3:56:15] <codesounds> thay means that pat is also playing RE6 also?
[3:56:16] <Rostichenburg> She's 26 in RE6? She looks way younger
[3:56:17] <%TheQButton> If this was Paige she'd belly to belly suplex her right then and there.
[3:56:18] <ha2ken> RE2...where everyone needs to be told that people are or are not zombies...
[3:56:20] <+SpoonlessAlakazam> hmmm vargThink
[3:56:20] <%doc_ock_rokc> @AngriestPat Sherry is very sheltered so she could be stunted emotionally
[3:56:21] <%imadoc91> He sounded more upset about the fact that she wasn

[3:57:39] <%Nobara> isn't there some Creepy sexual component to the G virus?

[4:04:04] <%imadoc91> I'm super hyped Pat. From what I can tell there were massive optimizations made for the PS4 version, I hope it happens on PC as well.

[4:04:14] <chronoxgp> marketing doesn't care
[4:04:15] <%Jekado> because PC players can't see inferior consoles i guess?
[4:04:15] <%valriot> ahh, the fake fans
[4:04:16] <mastertwin2> NotLikeThis that makes no sense
[4:04:16] <xeros720> guess the pc sales were good
[4:04:18] <%AncelDeLambert> admittedly, I DO need to bulk up on all the marketing material for the game
[4:04:18] <%DesuDesuDokiDoki> eh i guess
[4:04:18] <Thenuclearwalrus> ?? If they could avoid spoilers from the console version, they can avoid spoilers now
[4:04:18] <+Darren716> Its monster hunter the fuck is there to spoil?

[4:04:26] <DashXero> Wouldn't have to worry about that if the PC version were released in a timely manner.
[4:04:31] <%ArcanumMBD> Why would PC players who patiently waited now watch a PC stream instead of all the other PS4 streams
[4:04:32] <+Reizie_Etherealm> Where is Ja LUL
[4:04:32] <%D3rrtyD4n> they're so full of shit

[4:04:39] <+Pookiedaexzile> If 9 caj't see spoilers no onecan
[4:04:44] <@commanderclaw> I have been spoiled: You have to fight a big strong monster and use it's parts to make armor
[4:04:51] <SulfurousAcid> CCCCOMBO
[4:04:52] <$Dakuu75> Monster Hunter World is 60% on steam and then Ice Born comes out in about 2 weeks
[4:04:52] <AutechreTwinAphex> MHW needs like a 2080 Ti to run it at 60fps 4K and even then only with DLSS
[4:04:53] <$Hommando> Sheri kills speedruns because of the cockroaches
[4:04:54] <%DesuDesuDokiDoki> the real reason is "japan hates streamers'LPers"
[4:04:56] <%blondie_ow> Actually kinda tough?
[4:04:57] <mastertwin2> I guess certain monsters are cool reveals and people don't want it ruined?
[4:04:58] <chronoxgp> big ice dragon

[4:07:31] <%a_c_chirns> Dogs Do Combo
[4:07:31] <Oxybe> Sherry should just powerbomb the doggos.
[4:07:33] <%Jekado> can't you matrix kick the dogs like in the RE movies?
[4:07:34] <+Freelance7> Man, I gotta play 2 Remake again

[4:07:38] <%D00msDayDan> combo that child to death
[4:07:39] <%XzileGaming> i cant wait for someone to insert these voluntary VA's Pat has been providing us with into a modded version of RE2. Sherry is also the eprfect height for a custom model of pat.
[4:07:41] <garbageheaphound> Combo that child

[4:08:15] <%doc_ock_rokc> @Sphincter_Spelunker its funny but I still get hurt because starwars was one fo the few things my dad and I bonded over and now its ruined
[4:08:18] <$Dakuu75> @Yomigami nope. you play as sherry a little in the orphanage but, she doesn't have to deal with enemies like this
[4:08:24] <+AngelYoumou> Either those crates are massive, or Sherry is TINY
[4:08:27] <%DappercatEsquire> Sherry does sick parkour
[4:08:28] <+NovaTera> the explosion threw them into the city
[4:08:33] <extradopeness> UMB? UMBRELLA? it all makes sense!
[4:08:35] <Ultimatefool> @Yomigami She deals with one enemy - FAT EVIL
[4:08:37] <%ThatOneGuyYouSaw> @doc_ock_rokc >now
[4:08:38] <santystuffs> Nice little detail is that in RE2make she ahs the exact same climbing animation
[4:08:39] <+Zxtole> Old Star Wars is still good, new ones are just bad
[4:08:47] <%a_c_chirns> UNBrella
[4:08:51] <Oxybe> What you mean Starwars ruined? its a great birthday movie series.
[4:08:51] <Monkeyweed21> why is Sherry dressed like a 19th century choir boy? @AngriestPat
[4:08:57] <SoySocks> the police are also the water dept
[4:08:58] <%Guardiansaiyan> @AngriestPat when playing Remake 2...will you use the polygon models for claire and Leon and classic outfits for Ada and Sherry?
[4:09:02] <+Pookiedaexzile> @Zxtole No star wars wasalways shit
[4:09:03] <%Nina96> which "old" starwars?
[4:09:04] <%Jekado> seems like a dumb place to store shit too
[4:09:05] <Oxybe> three movie series
[4:09:06] <officerodoherty> i love that the water level is perfecly hight enough to make a perfectly flat bridge across the two levels LUL god, i love old games.
[4:09:07] <sothatsprettybrutal> "dunno why this room would exist but alright" the RE2 motto
[4:09:09] <%SoFarFetched> man I forgot how depressing her picture is
[4:09:13] <piggypig> G A M I N G
[4:09:15] <+spacehouse> rich people schools do that
[4:09:17] <%JojoPiero> To avoid putting a 12yo in a skirt while climbing things
[4:09:17] <mayorrev> I miss the 3D models already
[4:09:18] <%doc_ock_rokc> @ThatOneGuyYouSaw yeah the prequils sucked but they didn't ruin everything good about the OT
[4:09:19] <+AngelYoumou> Raccoon City is just an Eldritch Location.
[4:09:21] <%a_c_chirns> she's going to sailor school
[4:09:21] <%Zaxshimysham> Because my japanese anime told me so
[4:09:22] <%DesuDesuDokiDoki> japanese girl middle schooler
[4:09:22] <$Hommando> William Birkin was a weeb and made Sherry wear the sailor outfit
[4:09:24] <$Sphincter_Spelunker> @doc_ock_rokc nah, just one chapter closed. always hope for the future. unless it gets canned. saw someone comment, "Bold strategy of Disney to buy out the only competition to Marvel and kill it."
[4:09:24] <%Flasktoss> She works at the docks.
[4:09:26] <alwayspronking> LUL She looks so done in her picture
[4:09:29] <SparkAfterDark> There was a play at school and she played a sailor extra
[4:09:30] <Mexrage> because the development team didn't knew the sailor fuku wasn't a thing on the west, according to kamiya @AngriestPat
[4:09:30] <ShichiNoBushi> It was made in Japan. That's why she's dressed like that.
[4:09:33] <%NovaKnightmare> at least Mandalorian is Good
[4:09:34] <extradopeness> She looks like Fred from scooby doo
[4:09:35] <%Nobara> Its for the creepy incest Pat
[4:09:35] <+Invlux> Japan: What do american children do?? what do they even LOOK LIKE???
[4:09:38] <%Sovspot> Holy shit the little girl is smart as fuck
[4:09:39] <$Dakuu75> private schools and catholic schools use uniforms, I think
[4:09:39] <+YmirFall> Is call japan weird sense of clothing
[4:09:40] <uncledoodsauce> i live by plinket's belief that phantom menace is the most disappointing thing since my son.
[4:09:42] <CoffeeSlice> LUL
[4:09:50] <%imadoc91> She looks like a Jojo's Bizarre adventure side character.
[4:09:50] <Ion_Laser> Anything is better than George Lucas with no editor
[4:09:52] <$Hommando> Sherry's parents are actual geniuses
[4:09:54] <codesounds> Play RE gaiden next
[4:09:57] <%Jekado> isn't throwing grenades dangerious?
[4:09:57] <%Teintstein> damnn
[4:09:59] <%blondie_ow> Sherry is strong as fuck
[4:09:59] <@commanderclaw> She even throws them overhand
[4:10:00] <Monkeyweed21> Do private schools make children dress like the Neverland Ranch?
[4:10:01] <%DesuDesuDokiDoki> STRONG CHILD
[4:10:01] <%Teintstein> girl's got an arm
[4:10:03] <sothatsprettybrutal> CLANG
[4:10:03] <PurePlatinumKyo> iirc Kamiya said Sherry is dressed like that because the dev team straight up didn't know what American school uniforms looked like (or even if they existed) :U

[4:10:04] <Run44forrest> monkaS a grenade?

[4:10:40] <%42nfl19> @AngriestPat Do you think they will pull a Marvin on Brad and extend his role a bit? Trailers kind of imply it?
[4:10:40] <+YmirFall> Cherry sheriffGASM
[4:10:44] <Heartless_01> original RE2 was better than REmake 2 imo
[4:10:52] <%D3rrtyD4n> who is also a monster
[4:10:52] <+Pookiedaexzile> thats right I'm a secondary
[4:10:52] <Run44forrest> hasLost sherry

[4:10:56] <SparkAfterDark> I love my daddy
[4:10:56] <Rostichenburg> This costume was way too pink in the remake
[4:10:56] <%mighty_max_t> I Love My Daddy!
[4:10:57] <DSD24> "I love my daddy!"
[4:10:57] <%honeyman18> Sherry you dumb bitch it's a town full of zombies
[4:10:58] <%Quigsies> fambly
[4:10:59] <rytisone> I love my daddy

[4:11:07] <TigerClaws12> so claire wears...yoga hot pants underneath her jeans hot pants?
[4:11:07] <%spiritofmojave> I love my daddy!
[4:11:10] <%InugamiTheHound> how did Sherry know to give Claire grenade rounds for her grenade launcher?
[4:11:12] <%floralkami> Ever try speedrunning these?
[4:11:12] <SilverJakler> why lickers gotta look like that
[4:11:15] <Monkeyweed21> I WANT DADDY TO IMPREGNATE ME
[4:11:20] <Mexrage> this is why there are no zombie childrens on raccoon city, because childrens are so badass, they never died to the zombies and BOWs
[4:11:21] <%D3rrtyD4n> atpSuspect she's fine
[4:11:23] <star_feline> fun trick: Just NUKE the fucker
[4:11:23] <officerodoherty> @Futurecity10 leon takes her in unil the government basically takes her, then goes on to be a professor of like. virology? is that the term? and creates cures for a virus in Resident Evil: Vendetta [ a cg movie ]
[4:11:24] <%TheQButton> This one trick Lickers hate it!
[4:11:26] <%ThatOneGuyYouSaw> Kreia is unironically the best Star Wars character ever written.
[4:11:27] <%JojoPiero> You just shot my Ex I think
[4:11:29] <%crimsonharvest> *bew*
[4:11:34] <+Taglog7> I LUV MY DADDY
[4:11:34] <%Nina96> @Monkeyweed21 WutFace
[4:11:35] <$Hommando> I bet they will extend Brad's role in RE3. It looks like Jill is aware of Nemesis at the beginning of the game rather than meeting him at the police department so they don't have to kill Brad right there.
[4:11:39] <CALLthaDoctah> Kreia is the ultimate fence sitter
[4:11:39] <sothatsprettybrutal> it's really powerful
[4:11:44] <%GeneralSCPatton> @thatoneguyyousaw BIG TRUTH
[4:11:46] <officerodoherty> @Futurecity10 oh wait, got that mixed up, the virlogy thing is rebecca
[4:11:49] <%blondie_ow> ZOMBAMBOS
[4:11:53] <%ThatOneGuyYouSaw> @CALLthaDoctah apathy is death
[4:11:54] <AllJoeShow> almost
[4:11:55] <CALLthaDoctah> Kreia is a diehard centrist. She's pissed at you no matter what you do
[4:11:57] <AllJoeShow> so close
[4:11:58] <gravitydazequeen> Lickers are a one-shot
[4:11:59] <$Dakuu75> too bad in the remake, if you run they fucking DUNK on your ass

[4:12:11] <%DappercatEsquire> @AngriestPat , so did that guy stuff himself in the morgue after getting bitten?
[4:12:13] <+PJSmooth> They were on the same hockey team
[4:12:14] <%doc_ock_rokc> Mmmm MMM
[4:12:14] <Rostichenburg> Sherry becomes an agent for the government in RE6
[4:12:15] <SoySocks> it's almost like they were workers with uniforms, pat
[4:12:16] <$insaneintentionsyo> zombabies
[4:12:16] <%D3rrtyD4n> HahaReindeer
[4:12:16] <+Vijuani> nice asses
[4:12:18] <SulfurousAcid> It's a fashion disaster!
[4:12:18] <+Rivet95> Kreia suffers from the fact the game REWARDS you for picking a side. It's dumb.
[4:12:20] <%blondie_ow> Tommy and his many twin brothers died in here
[4:12:25] <officerodoherty> @Futurecity10 sherry becomes an FBI agent or some shit in re6
[4:12:25] <Monkeyweed21> THE MINORITIES ARE COMING FOR CLAIRE
[4:12:25] <uncledoodsauce> even kingdom hearts doesn't suffer from terrible world building that star wars does. you can't prove that kh3 is more disappointing than last jedi. Kappa
[4:12:35] <+YmirFall> Hey back in the day capcom had a low budget ok LUL
[4:12:37] <%ThatOneGuyYouSaw> Kreia wants you to pick a side, just not blindly.
[4:12:38] <AllJoeShow> all 5 of the brothers!
[4:12:43] <+heroicspiritavenger> Oh noooooo
[4:12:43] <%TheQButton> Everyone hates that room.
[4:12:46] <AllJoeShow> gunna be a tough letter home
[4:12:49] <+dustingunn> does pat still think the zombies aren't undead
[4:12:51] <Rostichenburg> KH3 is way better than Last Jedi only Kairi was disappointing in that
[4:12:52] <eco419> D:
[4:12:52] <mayorrev> is paige asleep
[4:12:56] <%a_c_chirns> Capcom had to buy them all matching shirts for budget reasons

[4:13:03] <%honeyman18> ammo check room I guess
[4:13:06] <+trekkie11041> BIG ZAP
[4:13:07] <stingray53_1> yea KH3 was great
[4:13:08] <%Nina96> Piage uses poisoned bagels to kill women
[4:13:10] <spiegspikel> Wait. What were this shells bouncing off of?
[4:13:10] <$Hommando> Resident Evil needs a game where all of the forgotten B-team members are the protags.
[4:13:10] <%doc_ock_rokc> @Rivet95 yes but still its fun no matter what
[4:13:12] <%blondie_ow> LEAVE LEON JACKSHIT
[4:13:15] <%JojoPiero> Paige is quiet because she Eat a Bagel
[4:13:15] <mayorrev> wait this is zap?
[4:13:19] <mayorrev> how so

[4:13:22] <+ahdurian> ok there john wick
[4:13:29] <+spadoinkle> Does anyone know if nemesis's hands are normal? Google isn't helping.
[4:13:30] <eco419> apatWhat Yay free emote
[4:13:30] <$Sphincter_Spelunker> Paige got food poisoning from bagels, just like Woolie and eggs
[4:13:31] <DSD24> Aww
[4:13:32] <%GeneralSCPatton> Some of what Kreia says almost paints The Force as an Elder God manipulating the galaxy to some unknowable end. I love that. The Force was the big bad all along.
[4:13:33] <santystuffs> @mayorrev whatever he picks up here, Leon won't be able to pick on the B scenario
[4:13:34] <$Dakuu75> all of that bagel-hate probably tuckered Paige out~ she might've gone to bed
[4:13:34] <Monkeyweed21> Are you going to see Cats or Star Wars? @AngriestPat
[4:13:38] <mayorrev> ohhhh ok
[4:13:40] <Rostichenburg> No game needs Jill's partner from Revelations in it not even Revelations
[4:13:40] <+Rivet95> @doc_ock_rokc you're not wrong. Best Star Wars IP hands down. Followed closely by Kotor 1.
[4:13:46] <%Nina96> Paige is drunk driving a bagel
[4:13:49] <%ForlornCarton> Zap!
[4:13:50] <%SoFarFetched> @Monkeyweed21 They're seeing star wars tomorrow
[4:13:50] <Spyder1246> Hey I'm back, is Paige gone?
[4:13:56] <+YmirFall> Why not pick up?
[4:14:03] <$insaneintentionsyo> Pat your category is for re2 remake
[4:14:04] <santystuffs> @YmirFall so Leon gets them
[4:14:04] <uncledoodsauce> RE doesn't world building. you just need jill sandwiches and lockpicks. Kappa
[4:14:05] <+heroicspiritavenger> @rostichenburg you mean Parker?
[4:14:08] <Neo_Kaiser> Why would anyone go see a Disney Star Wars movie?
[4:14:14] <SivSarcast> Go down the Woolie Hole? Y/N
[4:14:14] <+YmirFall> Ah makes sence
[4:14:16] <extradopeness> I can’t believe Paige would defend a man who eats bagels while driving
[4:14:17] <Monkeyweed21> Z A P
[4:14:18] <mayorrev> big zaps
[4:14:21] <Rostichenburg> @heroicspiritavenger I couldn't even remember his name
[4:14:21] <$Dakuu75> Paige is making a ginger-bread-house out of bagels
[4:14:21] <%Ranryu692> I saw Star Wars earlier. It was a movie, I guess
[4:14:29] <Fujiwara_92> ZAP
[4:14:35] <$Sphincter_Spelunker> @Neo_Kaiser why do people watch Neil Breen?
[4:14:37] <eco419> apatWhat zap
[4:14:39] <MojoKingIzakku> you and your zapping system *shakes fist*
[4:14:40] <%SoFarFetched> oh yeah that's true he did do it for the remake
[4:14:41] <%doc_ock_rokc> @Rivet95 but its nto a standalone Game. It kinda requires the prequels and the OT in order to work. and in the process enhances the Prequels and OT
[4:14:41] <%legendscar01> this music is the shit
[4:14:42] <Ion_Laser> @Neo_Kaiser Cause when the prequels are rock bottom there is nowhere to go but up
[4:14:43] <%honeyman18> I need to see the trash movie though, matinee on a Friday
[4:14:45] <spiegspikel> “thAtS NOT wHAt thE ZaPPiNg sYsTem iS abOUt!”
[4:14:57] <+YmirFall> But don’t you share items Thur the item box?
[4:14:59] <%JojoPiero> Is Stars wars even good? I've only seen that one where Mark Hamill died because my wife wanted to go see it
[4:14:59] <TalisKanju> Neil Breen is a name I didn't expect to see in this chat.
[4:15:07] <%TheQButton> What's Leon gunna use to fight Zombies without his machine gun? His gorgeous boy band hair?
[4:15:09] <%Nina96> "U DONT KNOWWWWWWW!!!"
[4:15:09] <Neo_Kaiser> If the prequels are rock bottom than Disney started digging.
[4:15:11] <DSD24> Star Wars is good
[4:15:15] <extradopeness> Honestly eating and driving is bad too tho joking aside
[4:15:16] <+Pookiedaexzile> star wars sucks and
[4:15:17] <Ion_Laser> @JojoPiero Episode 5 is good
[4:15:18] <%Xooler67> Xooler67 subscribed with Twitch Prime. They've subscribed for 14 months! Hey 14 months woo!
[4:15:19] <santystuffs> @YmirFall not between characters

[4:15:32] <Run44forrest> Kappa
[4:15:32] <peachy996> Neil Breen is old hat, it's all about the Director behind Shark Exorcist

[4:16:04] <+Darren716> Im sure Niel wont mind
[4:16:05] <TalisKanju> I saw Twisted Pair and then we had a Q&A with Neil Breen
[4:16:06] <+Rivet95> @doc_ock_rokc disagree - even without the others the game is still great, but just because having context helps does nothing to enhance the other garbage
[4:16:09] <DSD24> Blue Blue Skies
[4:16:09] <%honeyman18> Twisted Pair is Gods gift
[4:16:17] <+YmirFall> Death stranding 2: there will be even more boxes...

[4:18:06] <Captain_Aham> Man, what a weird version or REmake
[4:18:09] <+heroicspiritavenger> Is the rumor true that Paige was advocating being drunk with power, and driving people away so that they could live in a cardboard box with nothing to subsist upon than week old bagels? Then when they die, she collects the skeletons for her collection and her various “purposes”. I hear that Skellmo is actually the remains of one of her victims.

[4:21:12] <+Invlux> Can pat make it through the rest of RE2 without calling a zombie a bitch? doubtful
[4:21:13] <zer0crow> @huntahsphee time to invest into chameleon eyes so you can watch at least two of them at once
[4:21:20] <TalisKanju> How do Rebecca and Billy end up in the same place Claire and Leon do in Resident Evil 2?

[4:21:52] <coracor> fedoralord pat
[4:21:52] <+ahdurian> Newmesis
[4:21:53] <officerodoherty> @AngriestPat you take that back he looks AWFUL
[4:21:55] <+MisterCrimson> I prefer Persuer, myself
[4:21:58] <%JojoPiero> It's the Tiny Hat!
[4:21:59] <+tsatoma> New Nemesis: tomatoSniff
[4:22:03] <+TheBeastman1122> Mr. X for Marvel
[4:22:04] <extradopeness> Nemesis has a god damn rawkit lawn chair
[4:22:05] <%XeroSigmaPrime> @Rostichenburg City isnt nuked at end of RE2, its nuked a day after RE2
[4:22:06] <TheImmortal70> 3 takes place before and during 2
[4:22:08] <+Trair> @rostichenburg the fate of raccoon city is VERY non canon based on what you’re playing. The remakes should make it consistent
[4:22:12] <%Nina96> @Sphincter_Spelunker k maybe ill watch it
[4:22:13] <Ion_Laser> @Rostichenburg The city is nuked at the end of 3 not 2
[4:22:15] <%Poseidon2462> what do you think the next bioweapon will be for the RE series. we've had viruses, parasites, and mold. what's next?
[4:22:16] <%honeyman18> How fast you gotta solve puzzles to eat on your lunch break?
[4:22:17] <$Sphincter_Spelunker> WAIT no. Click was good too
[4:22:19] <zer0crow> @Teintstein Dunno, inflation's a killer
[4:22:20] <djazo> @taliskanju it.s ok RE0 sucks
[4:22:27] <$insaneintentionsyo> alien
[4:22:27] <Captain_Aham> Mr X is a terminator, Nemisis is just an asshole with a rocket
[4:22:28] <Superblooms> Mr. X was more of a suprise as well.
[4:22:29] <%a_c_chirns> I hate the "Mr. X" rename
[4:22:30] <%cdrom321> cdrom321 subscribed at Tier 1. They've subscribed for 8 months, currently on a 7 month streak! Any idea when your next session of guiding the blind through Dark Souls 2 will be?
[4:22:30] <tigerfang86> JUST in case they needed a SECRET mutant
[4:22:30] <%JojoPiero> >Adam Sandler movies argued as good
[4:22:32] <slekotv> Imagine seeing mr x on the street
[4:22:32] <%ThatOneGuyYouSaw> @AngriestPat that fedora looks good on him
[4:22:33] <Run44forrest> tall, dark, handsome. Mr. X
[4:22:33] <Monkeyweed21> @Poseidon2462 Biocurse
[4:22:36] <+Punchasaur> He’s Gray Hulk
[4:22:40] <randomness_yo> @AngriestPat But Mr X doesnt shout "STAAARRRSS"
[4:22:42] <sothatsprettybrutal> the greatest R&D cost of the Mr. X program was designing and manufacturing his massive coat
[4:22:43] <+Zxtole> The next RE bioweapon will be aliens
[4:22:44] <%devanmuse> @poseidon2462 fungus?
[4:22:46] <TalisKanju> @djazo RE 0 sucks, that's true
[4:22:46] <%Teintstein> it's a lovely trilby
[4:22:47] <$Sphincter_Spelunker> @JojoPiero it's a low bar. therefore easy to pick from
[4:22:47] <zer0crow> @Poseidon2462 Bio-curses are my guess
[4:22:47] <%XeroSigmaPrime> @Trair What do you mean, Racoon City has always been nuked. It just happens a day after RE2
[4:22:54] <santystuffs> Havent you guys saw the pizza boxes on the Umbrella lab? I bet they sent Mr X to pick it up for them Kappa
[4:22:59] <Fujiwara_92> Why yall tslking aboot adam sandler wth
[4:23:02] <Ralfclogs> jphPickle
[4:23:05] <$Dakuu75> best things that came from the remake were the 5,000% facial animation CS and allt he "X gonna give it to ya" montages lol
[4:23:06] <+Invlux> @Poseidon2462 can't be mushrooms regrettably, that already got taken
[4:23:07] <Run44forrest> chad mr x vs virgin nemesis
[4:23:11] <%JojoPiero> I'll give you that @Sphincter_Spelunker
[4:23:13] <SoySocks> wasn't Mr X named that because of a name on a toy?
[4:23:15] <+Promessa_EX> Kind of like how you attempt to look like a human at 5 feet tall
[4:23:21] <+Promessa_EX> Ayy
[4:23:24] <%Maids4lyfe> yes soysocks
[4:23:26] <santystuffs> Yep, but the name stuck for the fans
[4:23:27] <extradopeness> Mr X is way more intimidating and he’s unarmed it’s kinda wild
[4:23:27] <officerodoherty> @Promessa_EX LUL LUL LUL
[4:23:28] <+Trair> @xerosigmaprime it’s always in a different way. I think outbreak 3 and 2 all have different ways the city gets blown up
[4:23:31] <neet98> what game have the best Nemesis voice?
[4:23:33] <+Pookiedaexzile> Yo who excited Punisher season 3 is going to hulu

[4:25:06] <+Punchasaur> Hey Hitler was a tyrant.. did umbrella make him? 🤔
[4:25:11] <$Dakuu75> RE has so much bull-shit, I forget WHY they created the T-virus? Just generic bio-weapon?
[4:25:15] <%honeyman18> That ain't enough for this level of shit
[4:25:15] <neet98> think they gonna try saving RE 5 and 6?
[4:25:17] <%NovaKnightmare> @punchasaur yes
[4:25:17] <McAngrimStein> Search the entire city for anyone suspicious
[4:25:18] <Cerabret100> @Nina96 basically nemesis is for "we don't give the slightest fuck about pretending normalcy, kill Jill"
[4:25:19] <+YmirFall> Economy right there. When 10k was money. Today it would probably say 250k g lol
[4:25:19] <%XeroSigmaPrime> @Trair It get nuked in one of the Outbreak (one shows it, other doesnt) and RE3 definitely shows it being nuked. RE2 doesnt talk or show RAcoon City being destroyed at all, only the Lab in RE2 sefl destructs
[4:25:22] <ShichiNoBushi> "G is MY CREATION!!!"
[4:25:26] <Rostichenburg> Umbrella sells BOWs for money

[4:29:19] <+Punchasaur> Claire just stared at him without reacting
[4:29:19] <Graxe_> Yes
[4:29:20] <SivSarcast> At least Ultimate Being from Parasite Eve had Gundam Funnels.
[4:29:21] <+Trair> Wait, we’ve had G and T virus. Are we going to get A and C? Like the dna shit? That’d be clever
[4:29:22] <+Pookiedaexzile> Yes

[4:29:27] <SparkAfterDark> DPS RACE
[4:29:27] <Graxe_> They made this an enemy type instead of a boss
[4:29:27] <djazo> he sounds a little bit like nemmy
[4:29:29] <+Schlomogoldbergsteinowitz> THE HYPEST GAMEPLAY ON TWITCH TUBE
[4:29:29] <+Invlux> That's Pat when Paige is in bed trying to get to sleep

[4:29:35] <rytisone> not as tough as plant 42
[4:29:37] <%BeefyQueefer> don't that slug leach bit you right on the cooter
[4:29:38] <+YmirFall> Lmao
[4:29:38] <%TheQButton> So that's what the G spawns are based off of, I didn't realize until now.
[4:29:39] <%ThatOneGuyYouSaw> @AngriestPat I ran away from that Uroboros dude in Revelations 2, and the boss fight just ended.
[4:29:39] <Ralfclogs> PogChamp
[4:29:40] <+shaderichter_belmont> 7/5
[4:29:41] <Rostichenburg> @Trair The C virus is in 6
[4:29:41] <skinmansgds> A virus was in a movie
[4:29:43] <+joekuta71> I'm on the edge of my seat
[4:29:44] <santystuffs> Also kinda messed up how you come here with Sherry and she is not even phased LUL
[4:29:45] <captainspauldin> LUL
[4:29:48] <BurdRightsActivist> S RANK PogChamp
[4:29:48] <%Guardiansaiyan> @Trair we had the E and V virus
[4:29:51] <$insaneintentionsyo> regulated to sewer enemies
[4:29:53] <mastertwin2> I don't know man Covetous Demon would like a word
[4:29:55] <+Trair> @rostichenburg damn I’ve never even finished that game
[4:29:59] <$Dakuu75> how many letters of viruses are there?
[4:30:02] <%cdrom321> Are you playing this on an actual GameCube or Dolphin?
[4:30:03] <%ThatOneGuyYouSaw> it was weird
[4:30:03] <%DappercatEsquire> Or, and hear me out, leave the kid
[4:30:06] <+trekkie11041> @Trair c virus is in resident evil 6 A virus is in one of the animated movies
[4:30:06] <$Sphincter_Spelunker> Dolphin
[4:30:09] <rheviel> Wasn't fast enough, you won't make speed run times like this
[4:30:12] <%king_strongstyle> But fuck these guys in the remake
[4:30:17] <+Trair> @trekkie11041 way ahead of me then
[4:30:19] <marvel877> Dolphin with texture mods
[4:30:20] <%doc_ock_rokc> apatGoblin_RD
[4:30:23] <%cdrom321> @Sphincter_Spelunker Thanks. I thought it looked really sharp for GC.
[4:30:24] <breakerdsx> Fuck Irons
[4:30:30] <%Guardiansaiyan> @Dakuu75 26 letters of the alphabet...unless they start using Runes I don't think there will be anymore
[4:30:30] <%devanmuse> he hasn't fought birkin for the first time, right? the timeline of the remake is fucking me up
[4:30:30] <+Trair> Ironically they’re total bullet sponges in remake 2
[4:30:33] <Monkeyweed21> Sherry loves the gore
[4:30:34] <DavidSanChan> blanket on body tech didn't work so hot back then
[4:30:38] <%TheQButton> Should I bother with the novel?
[4:30:38] <+Shinted24> The perry books are great.
[4:30:42] <%Maids4lyfe> Birkin already fucked Irons Kappa
[4:30:43] <djazo> and that's why he is a normal enemy in the remake
[4:30:44] <+YmirFall> It was budget cuts man
[4:30:48] <%mistersups> Chie Fi Ron
[4:30:48] <%xsnowfox> if we can just escape from this horrible nightmare, then we can escape from this horrible nightmare
[4:30:51] <$Dakuu75> @Guardiansaiyan lol
[4:30:52] <%Guardiansaiyan> @devanmuse official fight against birkin hasn't happened yet
[4:30:52] <Graxe_> We're leaving

[4:31:20] <+Schlomogoldbergsteinowitz> Girls are flippant
[4:31:21] <$insaneintentionsyo> Nicholai surviving is canon too
[4:31:21] <rytisone> I wish Claire and Leon had more interaction in Remake
[4:31:26] <+Invlux> Sherry walking past a bisected corpse: Yooo sick lol
[4:31:28] <+Shinted24> @ranger747 they’re pretty good but the canon in them is slightly different to the games.
[4:31:30] <+the_fantastic_omo> Save radio battery?
[4:31:31] <%Maids4lyfe> the noise would attract zombies @AngriestPat
[4:31:31] <theKingRamses> maybe so zombies don't hear the radio if leon tries to keep saying stuff?
[4:31:33] <%Starwarp08> i have been a fan since the Demons souls machinima video!!
[4:31:33] <+YmirFall> Brilliant
[4:31:33] <%crazyspartan214> No signal in the swears
[4:31:35] <+ahdurian> its so she doesnt confess her love for Leon
[4:31:36] <djazo> she.s acting like a bitch LUL
[4:31:37] <+Pookiedaexzile> No she listens to him, andsays nothing...like a Beech
[4:31:38] <%fatally_furious> @rytisone but it's haaaaaardd
[4:31:39] <neet98> where is Wesker right now in story?
[4:31:40] <BurdRightsActivist> CLAIRE WAIT, CHRIS IS OUTSIDE
[4:31:41] <%ThatOneGuyYouSaw> Leon was mansplaining to her
[4:31:42] <twoto858> why does leon sound like James Sunderland
[4:31:45] <%xsnowfox> isn't sherry still alive-wait
[4:31:45] <%doc_ock_rokc> Because she is an independent woman who don't need no man!
[4:31:46] <%DappercatEsquire> Well guess we're getting him for RE8
[4:31:48] <%fatally_furious> that sounds like work
[4:31:49] <%Starwarp08> Read that file!
[4:31:49] <Graxe_> Well there's ORC
[4:31:51] <+Deko_> LUL
[4:31:58] <santystuffs> I mean, he COULD be alive, but depends what's canon from the OG RE3
[4:31:59] <%TheQButton> Hey kid wanna see a dead body?
[4:32:00] <+Schlomogoldbergsteinowitz> Kids LOVE dead bodies
[4:32:00] <Graxe_> But that's a separate continuity
[4:32:01] <%ClaudeMcGarren> @Graxe_ cmonBruh
[4:32:01] <Monkeyweed21> whens PRC
[4:32:02] <%Guardiansaiyan> @neet98 He escaped the mansion and is head of his own evil oginization
[4:32:04] <%SirGO0SE> not even zombie are still alive
[4:32:04] <Rostichenburg> Wesker is probably in Europe collecting viruses
[4:32:05] <+Pookiedaexzile> WAAARGH
[4:32:07] <%Guardiansaiyan> orginization
[4:32:09] <+MisterCrimson> I'm sure RE8 will bring back Wesker as a clone or Lava Monster or something
[4:32:10] <+PanicSwytch> Which game is Nicolai from?
[4:32:10] <DavidSanChan> hey irons you wanna go down
[4:32:10] <%Guardiansaiyan> damn
[4:32:13] <Tracazoid> Nikolai was the one smart enough to not infect himself in a desperate attempt to survive.
[4:32:18] <%xsnowfox> ahhh man the soothing sounds of classic re2
[4:32:20] <%Maids4lyfe> Nikolai is alive? I thought he was blown up by a rocket
[4:32:22] <Naho_Saenoki> @PanicSwytch RE3
[4:32:24] <+Shinted24> I thought Nikolai gets killed in canon?

[4:32:31] <djazo> didn't he explode with a helicopter?
[4:32:33] <Mercening> Isn't the theory that Wesker as always alive and the RE5 was a clone?
[4:32:33] <Graxe_> Nikolai just wanted to leave the city and get paid

[4:35:50] <tank7013> @Noelle_of_the_Nova Pretty much. Same shit he did to Irons anyway
[4:35:53] <+Invlux> I hope all the Flash hentai game makers are gonna find work after Flash gets axed

[4:36:05] <+Schlomogoldbergsteinowitz> More like the P virus
[4:36:12] <$Dakuu75> what Virus is Nemesis made of? is it also G? is that why he has hand-tentacles like Birkin?
[4:36:15] <%DedlokPM> @DappercatEsquire Only thing I remember about the RE7 DLC is Punch Grandpa.
[4:36:18] <%fatally_furious> i dont know how G Virus works
[4:36:27] <djazo> @angriestpat remember when they made sherry from re6 wear her cloth form re2 and how weird it was
[4:36:29] <%xsnowfox> the G virus works by making you the OG
[4:36:34] <+Schlomogoldbergsteinowitz> Man I forgot how short the original sewer section in re2 is
[4:36:36] <+Punchasaur> The locker
[4:36:38] <%JojoPiero> They;ll have to learn to use RPGMaker like the Japanese Hentai Gamedevs
[4:36:40] <santystuffs> @Dakuu75 Nemesis is basically a Mr. X infected by the virus Lisa Trevor had
[4:36:42] <%NovaKnightmare> @dakuu75 it's a Tyrant with T virus enhanced with a Nemesis Parasite
[4:36:46] <TriadOrion> Aww man, OG RE2? Hot damn

[4:37:35] <+SpoonlessAlakazam> Lisa Trevor vargSad
[4:37:36] <%xsnowfox> the bow gun is only for ada in re6. that game that doesn't exist
[4:37:41] <+LegendaryDorkKnight> it might as well be a sling shot
