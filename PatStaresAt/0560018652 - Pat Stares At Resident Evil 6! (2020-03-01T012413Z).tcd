[0:03:47] <tiaramaki> So today I learned that the physical copy of FFX/X-2 HD on the Switch doesn't have all the games on it, and since I'm borrowing a copy from the library, I can't play X-2 and the related titles cause no voucher. So that's neat psaJpeg

[0:05:34] <%Ganerumo> I was in the middle of catching up with the VODs of his first two parts
[0:05:41] <%BallerSwagBro9k> Chris Posting is THE BEST

[0:08:56] <%Razputin217> Gen X Rep
[0:08:57] <%Aracon_> shoot dog
[0:08:57] <%PlagueOfGripes> Are you saying Boomer or Boo-lennial?
[0:08:58] <%maskofmichael> PatStaresAt: the only Zombie streamer
[0:08:58] <Pwgregory> Piers and Chris! They’re friends who play together! Learning and sharing and junk! One is nice, and the other is less than nice! Who couldn’t love Piers and Chris? Best friends play together!

[0:09:14] <%marvel877> Do we really have to deal with this game today? Can't we listen to Paige talk about what happened at the gym? Did that guy get banned or what?
[0:09:16] <biomegabear> Leon seems to have more stuff happened

[0:09:26] <%Agami23> almost time for the boat pat
[0:09:28] <%BallerSwagBro9k> more u play less u have to do LUL
[0:09:29] <%scaryboisupreme> I'm baffled how RE6 wants you to conserve ammo while also having a campaign like Chris's in it
[0:09:30] <%Neo_Kaiser> You can beat Chris's campaign, 4 chapters that take 4 hours
[0:09:31] <%templar010> NOT FOR THIS
[0:09:31] <%GabeSweetMan> Story time stream to distract us from the game!
[0:09:32] <DrkJP520> The Chris demo made me not buy the game.

[0:10:05] <%optimasmaximas> @Dr_DangerPhD eh, some of the soldier moments were good; there was decent character stuff there
[0:10:06] <%Dr_DangerPhD> aircraft carrier section is a legit slog

[0:13:16] <%SirGO0SE> oh ya did paige go back to the gym and tell of the creep?
[0:13:22] <+therravinggamer> Pat you can still play something different, save yourself!
[0:13:25] <Fenlig> Chris is really lame!
[0:13:27] <biomegabear> interesting
[0:13:31] <trulythedude> all of these are stupid questions tbh
[0:13:32] <%j0ustar> that would be.... dumber somehow.
[0:13:33] <%peachy996> He would punch the boulder instead of run from it
[0:13:34] <%BallerSwagBro9k> Wesker is Chris nemesis
[0:13:38] <%Aracon_> molto bizzaro
[0:13:39] <thelonechris> Chris would defeat El Gigante with a single punch
[0:13:41] <+thackattack00> Does Leon even know who Wesker is?
[0:13:41] <%shiplord13> Yeah Leon doesn't have the same chemistry with Wesker
[0:13:42] <Psyramics> Casle section would be really short cause Chris would just punch through the walls
[0:13:43] <SLingard1999> i kind of prefer re6's mercs if you play the no mercy mode
[0:13:43] <%optimasmaximas> THEN CHRIS COULDNT FUCK JILL
[0:13:44] <biomegabear> wesker doesnt even know leon
[0:13:45] <TomFrank> leon couldnt punch that boulder
[0:13:50] <%PyodePlays> Cheer1000 Hey Nick, I'm Pat. Wait. Scratch that. Reverse it. Good luck with the terrible game. I'm looking forward to the PS1 level physics for the Humvee section.

[0:13:55] <trianglehat> oh yeah whats up with the gym story?
[0:13:56] <%bigboy3d> Leon would hyakuretsu kick the boulder
[0:13:56] <%SirGO0SE> any new lore on gym?
[0:14:06] <Pwgregory> Jill being mind controlled is a big part of 5...Chris and Jill go together.
[0:14:07] <%peachy996> I don't think Leon and Wesker have even met. Same with Leon and Jill

[0:16:39] <SLingard1999> thats jake 3
[0:16:40] <%Neo_Kaiser> But chapter 3 is the boats
[0:16:41] <MoonlightWolves> The evil within 2’s gun bejeweled mini game was pretty good
[0:16:43] <%xUmbraNinja> Skip to jake
[0:16:46] <%BallerSwagBro9k> LETS GOOOOOOOOO
[0:16:46] <%Th3SmartAlec> CAN'T WAKE UP
[0:16:47] <Blank9> Jake's campaign is great, Chris's is actually second best because of how bad Leon and Ada's is
[0:16:49] <%peachy996> This game sounds awesome. Way better than Deadly Premonition
[0:16:50] <%VashyronM> Jill
[0:16:51] <%maskofmichael> Jill
[0:16:52] <%TheMattman1313> It sounds like Chris has the worst campaign
[0:16:53] <dukenux> There must always be... a MANSION
[0:16:54] <jijipose> Is chapter 3 the part where you jump from barge to barge like an idiot?
[0:16:54] <Draco_Renegade> chris
[0:16:54] <%optimasmaximas> wesker
[0:16:55] <%krawtch> all of this shit sounds made up but the scars on my brain prove all of this is real shit this game put in
[0:16:56] <%peachy996> And especially fuck 4
[0:16:56] <SkyPirateArcane> Leon hands down
[0:16:57] <%D3rrtyD4n> zombies
[0:16:57] <silverira> Leon
[0:16:58] <%damienlunas> Chris
[0:16:59] <%Sir_stride> LEON
[0:17:00] <+Lunarhawk> weird thats not how you spell chris
[0:17:04] <%xUmbraNinja> Ada
[0:17:05] <%Th3SmartAlec> It should be Jill, but Capcom pushes Chris and Leon
[0:17:08] <%PlagueOfGripes> they have stories?
[0:17:08] <%shiplord13> More like Chris and Leon
[0:17:09] <dukenux> Correct Answer
[0:17:09] <%doc_ock_rokc> Im here for Depression
[0:17:10] <+SlumberMan> It Chris.
[0:17:10] <%YakumoYomi> Chris's chapter 3 is "Vengeance" where you're chasing Ada through China
[0:17:11] <Satanael1> Umbrellas
[0:17:11] <%SoFarFetched> say it
[0:17:11] <%BallerSwagBro9k> EMBRACE THE GARBAGE LET IT FUEL YOU
[0:17:11] <%dylanhack> cheer500 Hey Pat, my job deals with potatoes, so I have to know about them. Fun fact, McCain's is the #1 producer of french fries in the world. Thanks Canada.
[0:17:14] <%Emperor_Machinus> Jilleon
[0:17:14] <Psyramics> its the dude in the RE7 DLC that pile drives Molded
[0:17:18] <trianglehat> Bioterror
[0:17:23] <%studleydoorite> Mike
[0:17:24] <%PlagueOfGripes> I do not believe
[0:17:26] <Satanael1> the regular ones not the corporation
[0:17:28] <jijipose> Chris is the lamest out of Jill, Leon, Claire, and Chris though LUL
[0:17:28] <%MisterTylerrr> I just came back to Ultros Pat! Already saw you hanging out and it made me feel at home. How about that Ruby Weapon??
[0:17:29] <%j0ustar> Lies
[0:17:29] <%studleydoorite> it's Mike's story
[0:17:33] <%Dr_DangerPhD> the protagonist of the RE franchise is abstinence
[0:17:33] <%Dementedpenguin> Sadly, I wanna say Chris, considering his appearances throughout the series
[0:17:33] <Aydarkzero> hello i'm here for more re6 :)
[0:17:34] <Dragon_Batman> Stories is kinda generous
[0:17:35] <%peachy996> Capcom wants it to be Chris so much
[0:17:36] <%YakumoYomi> Chris basically goes all Captain Ahab
[0:17:40] <%Emperor_Machinus> Barry is the star
[0:17:44] <%D3rrtyD4n> fun fact: i like potatoes
[0:17:46] <%krawtch> The main character of RE is that rat from CVX
[0:17:47] <dabulousstreams> HELLOOOOO!!! Is this my son Micheals stream??
[0:17:51] <Aydarkzero> No Kappa
[0:17:55] <%peachy996> But ppl love Leon more and then Jill and Claire
[0:17:56] <%Puhff> No you're Pat
[0:17:58] <%th3_magicman> Leon is the BIGGEST hero
[0:17:59] <%BallerSwagBro9k> LUL
[0:18:03] <dukenux> LUL
[0:18:04] <Satanael1> HERO
[0:18:06] <SilverFaustX> xqc got banned LUL
[0:18:09] <+dante_must_die_exe> That movie was the big stupid
[0:18:10] <%Sir_stride> AND THEN THE ZOMBIES TURN BACK INTO PEOPLE
[0:18:12] <MyNameIsRasus> Potatoes are like the best food ever. You can do pretty much everything with them and they're good
[0:18:14] <%Conyst> I thought you were Pat?
[0:18:15] <%SoFarFetched> NO ITS ACTION SO ITS OKAY
[0:18:16] <%scaryboisupreme> Leon "Child Murderer" Kennedy
[0:18:19] <%walternatorz> LARGER THAN A NUKED CITY?
[0:18:20] <%stevesekai> Change your reticle Pat
[0:18:21] <Aydarkzero> man i missed the Simmons fight for Leon i actually like that boss theme
[0:18:21] <nademonkey1100> leon kill alot of people
[0:18:22] <%AwesomeDan_> resident evil 6 is stupid amount of collateral damage
[0:18:23] <%Fenrirlives> vendetta was the hypest trash ever
[0:18:23] <%krawtch> remember that movie where Leon was allied with lickers against a big tyrant
[0:18:23] <Dragon_Batman> Yea, power creep is a hell of a thing
[0:18:24] <Mrbaconator> NOT ANYMORE
[0:18:24] <%BallerSwagBro9k> @sir_stride WAIT WHAT?
[0:18:24] <trianglehat> no longer they don't
[0:18:29] <%Th3SmartAlec> Isn't it wierd how easily forgiven characters are in this?
[0:18:29] <%Quigsies> The ol Man of Steel problem
[0:18:30] <%SoFarFetched> IT WAS ALL STUNT DOUBLES
[0:18:30] <%maskofmichael> How is there still an Earth left at this point?
[0:18:30] <%VashyronM> Not anymore
[0:18:31] <MoonlightWolves> Can we go back to small scale?
[0:18:31] <PrettyThickandStrongDyck> Vendetta is a unintentational hilarious movie
[0:18:34] <jijipose> Every single fucking person that helped you in Leon's campaign died fucking horribly!
[0:18:34] <+gralho> Do you like apples?
[0:18:34] <%peachy996> Not in Setpiece land
[0:18:37] <%trustycoyote> They don't live there now
[0:18:40] <MyNameIsRasus> In RE7 it's like "THIS ENTIRE BAYOU? GONE"
[0:18:40] <%MrBorisMakarov> ITS FINE
[0:18:41] <biomegabear> Ive been bored with christ so far

[0:18:49] <%krawtch> REMEMBER WHEN ADA AND THE FEMALE PRESIDENT HAD A NINJA COMBAT SCENE
[0:18:51] <%Th3SmartAlec> Rememer when Helena got tens of thousands of people killed?
[0:18:52] <Dragon_Batman> Apples are pretty good
[0:18:53] <%SoFarFetched> People allergic to apples LUL

[0:18:57] <MyNameIsRasus> Apples are fine
[0:18:57] <%Fenrirlives> did my bits not get read?
[0:18:58] <trianglehat> a Doctor would hate it

[0:19:07] <%peachy996> I prefer pears myself
[0:19:07] <%TIME_PUNCHER> @patstaresat Jake is the Nero of the RE series, which means Vergil is Wesker. I hate it.
[0:19:09] <+therravinggamer> PAT THERE'S STILL TIME TO NOT PLAY THIS GAME! YOU CAN STILL SAVE YOURSELF AND PLAY SOMETHING BETTER!
[0:19:11] <Dragon_Batman> Amnesia more like
[0:19:12] <MyNameIsRasus> Sounds like it could be real
[0:19:12] <DrkJP520> I hope you don't mind me playing Gungeon while listening. I can't watch this.

[0:23:05] <%trustycoyote> So they took CoD merged it with Vanquish and toook out the fun. Got it.
[0:23:07] <%Th3SmartAlec> Bullets seem to be working
[0:23:09] <Monkeyweed21> Filthy Javos are a different species
[0:23:09] <+Skelegroove> Bullets kill them super easily though
[0:23:11] <jijipose> Bullets clearly phase them
[0:23:12] <silverira> BOWs only weakness GUN
[0:23:14] <%D3rrtyD4n> lol
[0:23:15] <%Kegeto> This needs to be droppped into satan asssholes and burn him in holey water

[0:23:36] <%NekoUrabe> psaElmo
[0:23:37] <+SkaiVibration> wild shit
[0:23:39] <%morcego_cinzento_arts> I find it weird that Chris's combat knife has much more moves then Leon's and yet Chris fights way more ranged enemies then Leon does....hell i even cannot remember if any of the monsters in Leon's story have any ranged attack\
[0:23:40] <dukenux> It looks like Gears of War so much

[0:23:43] <Satanael1> You shot the enemy now your punishment is that you need to shoot him twice as much

[0:24:32] <%doc_ock_rokc> @Th3SmartAlec They are not as smart as humans but they are okay
[0:24:32] <+Pyroclase> them being attached to feed tubes before they deploy is genuinely cool, to be honest
[0:24:34] <maxpasta> It’s even more fun when you play a different game
[0:24:35] <ZeludeRose> wow ive never seen footage of this game before the fuck is this haha

[0:24:39] <Satanael1> Is that the COLOSSAL TITAN???
[0:24:41] <%Sir_stride> what gets me, is that they based this campaign on being more actiony "like re and 5" despite RE4 and 5 never were this actiony
[0:24:43] <trianglehat> zombie kaiju
[0:24:43] <%Th3SmartAlec> @doc_ock_rokc So they're controlled then?
[0:24:44] <%SirGO0SE> Magnum Gigante PogChamp
[0:24:46] <%sjay449> Man
[0:24:47] <+Skelegroove> That thing doesn't look like an RE monster at all
[0:24:49] <%vectorless_peon> this is where it gets ultra dumb
[0:24:49] <%templar010> this is so stupid holy shit
[0:24:50] <%marvel877> Can't we just play Dino Crisis instead?
[0:24:50] <+prime_name> Why is it's heart in it's back?
[0:24:50] <%spiritofmojave> GRANDE GIGANTE

[0:24:59] <%Deft_Thought> I do like the idea of Chris just running roughshod through a mass of zombies like some human bulldozer, not gonna lie
[0:25:00] <%th3_magicman> This looks more like Gears of War than RE
[0:25:01] <tigerfang86> OH YEAAAAAAH
[0:25:02] <Klarrann3> it's a Titan! you have to cut the nape of the neck!
[0:25:02] <CloniiCory> This game is literally every gaming trend made popular in the early 2010s and it's a travesty.
[0:25:03] <shotgang86> man why even make ammo a resource?
[0:25:03] <+SkaiVibration> looooooooooool

[0:25:41] <%SlimeSlimeSlime> That day, Chris received a grim reminder.
[0:25:41] <%peachy996> Step your game up Chris
[0:25:41] <shinelucid> shadow of the evil
[0:25:43] <dukenux> Someone should set up a timer on Finn's introduction > when he dies

[0:26:00] <%morcego_cinzento_arts> I always got confused at which circustance do the C-Virus turns a person into a javo and when it turns one into a zombie. I assume that direct injection of the virus makes Javos and the airborne fog like spreed is like a different strain of the virus or just the different method of infections makes all the difference
[0:26:01] <%Zaphire_Saucypants> this music is eh

[0:26:46] <Zebroneath> This ain't no 15th collossus
[0:26:46] <%Th3SmartAlec> Man this track is just.... killing it
[0:26:47] <Higaraishi> have you tried punching it ?
[0:26:49] <jijipose> I like how the giant monster is less of a threat than a single human with shield arm and gun
[0:26:49] <%sjay449> Shingeki no BioTerrorism
[0:26:52] <tigerfang86> AMAZING music
[0:26:53] <+SkaiVibration> this music is pissing me off
[0:26:54] <+Skelegroove> This song is terrible
[0:26:56] <%SlimeSlimeSlime> @ape_hawk What do you think that big red thing on his back is?
[0:26:59] <ape_hawk> @MisterTylerrr sterile dont mean no dick
[0:27:00] <%Zaphire_Saucypants> shoot the enemy in the weakspot for MAXIMUM DAMAGE.
[0:27:01] <Dragon_Batman> Theme of Giant
[0:27:02] <dukenux> This track sounds like a remix of Clown Fart Basement
[0:27:02] <$PhantomMiG> !time
[0:27:03] <%anticrust> DUN DUN DAHDAH
[0:27:04] <tiaramaki> What IS with this track, anyway
[0:27:05] <%psychodave1234> is the music glitched? this cant be the actual track
[0:27:07] <%peachy996> Yeah whats going on with this music
[0:27:09] <Satanael1> Attack on Biohazard 6
[0:27:10] <ahbhajit> the re6 composer didn't have to go this hard
[0:27:10] <CloniiCory> Remember when Resident Evil had good music?
[0:27:12] <%TIME_PUNCHER> Oh man. Wesker is Vergil, Jake is Nero, Chris is Dante, Jill is Lady and Ada is Trish. It makes sense

[0:27:20] <rytisone> rip ant tear
[0:27:20] <%morcego_cinzento_arts> @ape_hawk It's universal that all viruses and overall parasitic organisms in RE get rid of your junk. And if one is female they also get rid of the nipples
[0:27:21] <trianglehat> punching, much better than bullets
[0:27:22] <%Th3SmartAlec> What

[0:27:31] <%vaporousTippler> Fuckin' Berserk.
[0:27:33] <%Th3SmartAlec> Nice timing

[0:28:07] <LixFury> I'm unconvinced that chris isnt secretly a wesker child
[0:28:08] <tigerfang86> SHOTGUN
[0:28:09] <%Sir_stride> GO BACK
[0:28:11] <%trekkie11041> PAT GUN
[0:28:11] <%Th3SmartAlec> Why don't people just mass produce Nemesis?

[0:28:13] <%maskofmichael> Just one?

[0:28:16] <%SirGO0SE> PAT GO BACK
[0:28:17] <%optimasmaximas> @PatStaresAt get shotgun
[0:28:17] <+Lunarhawk> That sewers name? Albert Wesker
[0:28:19] <Darkfire346> "one"
[0:28:23] <%Sir_stride> PAT GO BACK
[0:28:24] <%morcego_cinzento_arts> Chris would do just fine in Attack on titan. Also say what you will about that boss fight. I hate the turret section boss fight against the african El Gigante way more
[0:28:25] <%vectorless_peon> food costs would be sky high for making a giant humanoid like that
[0:28:26] <dukenux> this dude was sneakin onto you headless
[0:28:28] <tiaramaki> psaBig virus
[0:28:30] <%optimasmaximas> @PatStaresAt pat shotgun
[0:28:31] <+ItsYaGirlMaria> Back where big stupid head knocked you off
[0:28:31] <%SlimeSlimeSlime> Pat, why are you describing Coronavirus?
[0:28:32] <MoonlightWolves> Good job chat
[0:28:32] <jijipose> The little girl weapon in RE7 honestly seemed more effective
[0:28:37] <+Pyroclase> They wanted to nuke cities and render them uninhabitable with radiation. Viral weapons aren't much different.
[0:28:37] <%arancet> Has anyone in the RE story EVER made a single dollar from BOWs?
[0:28:40] <MayorRev> Wasn't the purpose of Bio Weapons to make multiple copies of Mr X / Nemesis?
[0:28:44] <%marvel877> When winter comes, the cold will kill all the gorillas.
[0:28:46] <%SilverDevilfish> Plothole: If the T-Virus only works on living things how did the zombies in CVX come out their graves?
[0:28:47] <%krawtch> big BOWs dont need more food because mass isn't real
[0:28:47] <Mirrorcatch> y'know, instead of bioweapons, umbrella could have just cured world hunger with the whole "biomass from nothing" thing
[0:28:48] <%mister___doctor> Chris runs like hes running to the bathroom
[0:28:49] <REXREVOLVER> food costs??? lmao
[0:28:50] <%peachy996> RE5 Turret sucks
[0:28:53] <Mr_Strut> I thought the purpose was just breeding tyrants, and the zombies were a side effect.
[0:28:54] <Pwgregory> What city?
[0:28:56] <Satanael1> PIERS
[0:28:57] <dabulousstreams> OPINIONS ON GEORGE MICHEAL!?
[0:28:57] <%Pappajimbo> its like aliens moves the company wants the alien. great you got one now what?

[0:29:04] <%peachy996> But then who cleans the zombies
[0:29:04] <Aydarkzero> No...
[0:29:06] <tigerfang86> SHUT UP THO
[0:29:06] <+Pyroclase> it can just be about deprivping your enemy of a city
[0:29:06] <Pwgregory> There ain’t no city.

[0:29:15] <%Zaphire_Saucypants> box but whatever
[0:29:16] <%doc_ock_rokc> @PatStaresAt The C virus is actually better because zombies die after a short time and they are non infectious
[0:29:16] <%VashyronM> They don't want the land. they just want the people dead
[0:29:17] <%Th3SmartAlec> They'll freeze to death in the winter!
[0:29:17] <%Deft_Thought> @arancet The most important thing is GLOBAL SATURATION and BIG CRIMES not money

[0:29:23] <dukenux> Chris 2
[0:29:24] <%peachy996> I recall Metallica has a music video on that
[0:29:25] <spinalwizard> Not those guys, we don't care about those guys
[0:29:25] <SPKTR34> in the movies the monsters can identify their masters
[0:29:25] <%Kegeto> yup 7 was logical in terms of bow
[0:29:25] <%th3_magicman> Pre-dead NPC
[0:29:26] <%psychodave1234> WHAT WAS HE SHOOTING AT
[0:29:26] <%KaosMachina> WAIT YOU CAN GET THERE IN TIME?
[0:29:29] <+dante_must_die_exe> It's the people who DON'T get blown up, who are important.
[0:29:29] <%shiplord13> @PatStaresAt They will just inject themselves with the virus.
[0:29:31] <%peachy996> "All Nightmare Long"
[0:29:32] <CloniiCory> Pretty sure dropping Zombies is a permanent thing. Less about taking over cities and regions and just burning them to the ground.
[0:29:32] <%trekkie11041> PAT YOU MISSED ITEMS
[0:29:35] <+JackMillerTime> no they have bunkers
[0:29:35] <iwa5h4ck3d> Thats Speedwagon
[0:29:36] <%Conyst> a dead man
[0:29:36] <Mr_Strut> I think the idea is breed tyrants in some rando city and then just use the tyrants you can control to capture shit you do want
[0:29:39] <+Mitchellsocks> Oh hell yeah, Pat's playing Spec Ops the line too?!
[0:29:42] <zeif00> It's worth it to rule a mutated flesh world for these guys apparently.
[0:29:46] <%Puhff> Release gorillas specifically trained to kill zombies
[0:29:48] <%RNGbob> what will you do when this bioweapon comes for you, Brother !?
[0:29:51] <%KaosMachina> If he takes too long an El Gigante equivalent shows up
[0:29:53] <%Th3SmartAlec> FART GAS
[0:29:55] <biomegabear> dont you get a burning feeling inside?
[0:29:55] <%Jekado> fartgas
[0:29:55] <tigerfang86> oh no it shot FART GAS
[0:29:57] <+ArtoriasTheTrenchfighter> How could someone enter warm water without being asleep Pat? The world needs to know!
[0:29:58] <%th3_magicman> Ah yeah pee gas
[0:29:58] <ahbhajit> fart gas
[0:29:59] <%GabeSweetMan> What's with all the fart gas?
[0:29:59] <Satanael1> even if you had a bunch of Mr. X tyrants you just need to have the military roll up with explosives and then that's dealt with
[0:29:59] <ape_hawk> MUSTARD GAS
[0:30:00] <%psychodave1234> fuckin fart gas for real
[0:30:02] <dabulousstreams> BLACK OPS ZOMBIES LOOKS INSANEEEEE
[0:30:03] <PrettyThickandStrongDyck> Pat wut
[0:30:04] <%Th3SmartAlec> You know why Pat
[0:30:04] <DrkJP520> Black Desert Online is free on steam right now, and you get to keep it forever. Might as well add it to your library.
[0:30:04] <%NekoUrabe> Elmo
[0:30:05] <%skizzuto> Chris is into watersports
[0:30:05] <dukenux> "I WANT THAT ZOMBIE FUCKING DEAD"
[0:30:05] <%krawtch> he made you reek like BOW farts
[0:30:10] <%TIME_PUNCHER> @patstaresat Just throw Mr. X and Nemesis at the zombies until the city is cleared, I don't fukken know
[0:30:13] <xxdj1173xx> did pat just run away from a first aid spray?
[0:30:13] <+BIumen> heard this was too much of a dumb action game but wow
[0:30:18] <trianglehat> biodegradable terror
[0:30:21] <+Pyroclase> The J'avo are genuinely useful as soldiersr
[0:30:25] <%Sir_stride> what I wanna know is, are the zombies and the javos from the same virus?
[0:30:28] <jorniev> what is this russia?
[0:30:29] <%MisterTylerrr> It's also injectable tho
[0:30:32] <Blank9> what's dumber about this than hillbilly punch dlc
[0:30:32] <zeif00> Oh hey Yuri
[0:30:34] <+Pyroclase> @Sir_stride yes
[0:30:35] <%SirGO0SE> these are just dudes
[0:30:36] <GUNxSPECTRE> Paige, can you throw your shoe at Pat on stream
[0:30:36] <%psychodave1234> YEET
[0:30:38] <%Th3SmartAlec> PogChamp
[0:30:38] <ape_hawk> that fuckin combo
[0:30:38] <%anticrust> Anti Tank Zomee
[0:30:41] <+Skelegroove> Umbrella could just make like a hundred tyrants instead
[0:30:43] <PrettyThickandStrongDyck> ok that looked cool
[0:30:43] <%sjay449> Also the villain of this game is Scarlet Johanson. A White Lady pretending to be Asian
[0:30:44] <%doc_ock_rokc> @Sir_stride YES but different strains
[0:30:45] <+Pyroclase> it's all C-virus, C-virus does literally everythgign you could ever want it to
[0:30:46] <dabulousstreams> WHAT ARE YOU DOING? GAMING?
[0:30:47] <maxpasta> This game is only so bad because it’s infected with the c virus
[0:30:51] <%neVan0> LUL
[0:30:52] <Dragon_Batman> Tight
[0:30:55] <dukenux> @Sir_stride different viruses, or different strains
[0:30:57] <tigerfang86> Sick butt slide
[0:30:58] <ape_hawk> how much is left of bad game?
[0:30:59] <%JJCheeker> It is daylight?
[0:31:01] <eyedntcry> that guy got fucked
[0:31:03] <trashcansan> holy shit, chris just crushed a man's skull with his elbow
[0:31:04] <%krawtch> Pat controls much better on his back than Chris
[0:31:06] <%morcego_cinzento_arts> @PatStaresAt I gather that the Zombies themselves were just like never intended to be b.o.w.s, just like by products of the experiments. i think the only intended b.o.w.s were the ones with proper code names, like Hunter, Cerberus, Neptune and Tyrant
[0:31:07] <%Sir_stride> THATS DUMB CAUSE THE JAVOS HAVE LAS PLAGUS THINGS
[0:31:07] <CloniiCory> It's super tactical! PogChamp
[0:31:10] <%Th3SmartAlec> @ape_hawk At least 2/3
[0:31:11] <$Piemono> Resident Evil, like Dead Space has always been about shooting random mooks with guns
[0:31:13] <ScreamLord> @PatStaresAt Yeah, but what if the virus mutates to become infectious?
[0:31:15] <%Neo_Kaiser> Are ya winning son?
[0:31:16] <LethalPlacebo> You can hold A when knocked down to get up fast.
[0:31:16] <zeif00> Mmmm C***** virus yes
[0:31:16] <ape_hawk> damnit
[0:31:17] <Satanael1> there's 2 more campaigns after Chris
[0:31:18] <%YakumoYomi> Other button is pause
[0:31:18] <%psychodave1234> man that knockdown mechanic isnt literally the fucking worst at all
[0:31:18] <PrettyThickandStrongDyck> @sjay449 So basically one of the main villians is wearing Yellow face....
[0:31:19] <%th3_magicman> Ah yeah, no pausing because THERES NO TIME
[0:31:20] <%doc_ock_rokc> @Sir_stride Normal C virus does zombies. Mixed in with Plagus DNA makes Javos
[0:31:23] <%krawtch> this action is too engrossing, there is no pausing this thrill ride.
[0:31:23] <%TIME_PUNCHER> Welcome to Whose Plot is it Anyway? Where the logic is made up and the story doesn't matter!
[0:31:28] <%mister___doctor> Is there a case for people who like this game
[0:31:29] <%scaryboisupreme> @Sir_stride Actually it's T-Veronica
[0:31:31] <%NDHCemployee> Looking at this makes me realize what a miracle RE 7 being good actually was
[0:31:33] <%CopperTucker> CopperTucker subscribed at Tier 1. They've subscribed for 7 months! I shit you not, I looked over at this game and thought it was Evil Within 1 for a solid minute. Also hi Pat, pet the baby, and thank you for many quality streams, and please chat send us your energy, as we are still looking for a house.
[0:31:34] <%trekkie11041> @Sir_stride they dont have las plagas?
[0:31:35] <+ausl0> more realistic that way
[0:31:36] <%Jekado> i can't understand this menu
[0:31:36] <%Sir_stride> @doc_ock_rokc ooooooh
[0:31:37] <dabulousstreams> WHY CANT CHRIS STAND ON HIS OWN TWO FEET EVER??
[0:31:39] <Pwgregory> There’s bad guys there Pat. Maybe don’t jump into the middle of the street.
[0:31:39] <%krawtch> dude every HUD sucks
[0:31:39] <ahbhajit> god this fucking UI
[0:31:44] <Satanael1> WHY
[0:31:44] <biomegabear> 0?
[0:31:46] <%MajorCrasher> this ui is abysmal
[0:31:46] <AnacondaVirtue> This UI is ATROCIOUS
[0:31:46] <%shiplord13> @PatStaresAt The real question is why terrorists willingly turn themselves into monsters and cannot be returned to normal if they win
[0:31:46] <+Ilpala> WHY WOULD THIS NOT HAVE A PAUSE
[0:31:47] <Timurine> I thought pat was wearing an apron
[0:31:50] <dukenux> i cant believe settings menu doesn't pause the game
[0:31:50] <%th3_magicman> What even is this UI?
[0:31:51] <dukenux> wtf
[0:31:51] <%Sir_stride> @trekkie11041 javos is very simular to plagus
[0:31:53] <%SirGO0SE> tbh the garbage that is re6 started in re5
[0:31:53] <%Puhff> Dear God
[0:31:55] <%Deft_Thought> Now would RE6 have been a decent game if the team had just focused on one of the three gameplay styles instead of trying to make this fucked up amalgam, I wonder
[0:31:57] <%Th3SmartAlec> @doc_ock_rokc Doesn't it also make weird animal creatures / TRex Flies too?
[0:31:57] <%peachy996> My kingdom for the classic RE Grid
[0:32:00] <biomegabear> is 0 no movement?
[0:32:01] <%doc_ock_rokc> @Sir_stride Basically C virus is cool because it can take aspects of other viruses and put them into humans
[0:32:07] <+Lillowh> Hammer the buttons and wiggle the sticks
[0:32:11] <REXREVOLVER> this game is a masterpiece and you're all too tiny brained to get it
[0:32:13] <%peachy996> OH WAIT THEY BROUGHT BACK THE GRID in every game after 6
[0:32:13] <maxpasta> Chris is doing a bad job looking out for his squad
[0:32:14] <%D3rrtyD4n> i remember this
[0:32:14] <%krawtch> oh yeah daddy blow my fence
[0:32:14] <%mister___doctor> Fuck is this lame ass music
[0:32:15] <%GabeSweetMan> NO YOU ARENT
[0:32:15] <%Th3SmartAlec> Blow the fence Finn
[0:32:15] <%sjay449> *screams REY*
[0:32:16] <%scaryboisupreme> Just pull the bar out
[0:32:22] <%Sir_stride> @doc_ock_rokc so a cool virus in a shit game
[0:32:22] <%Deft_Thought> The story still sucks ass but its not saved by being a slog to play through
[0:32:22] <%peachy996> Finn blow my fence
[0:32:23] <StarvingPenguinGod> punch the fence BrainSlug
[0:32:23] <%VashyronM> It's futuristic! Don't you love it?
[0:32:23] <dabulousstreams> ILL BLOW THE FENCE ;)
[0:32:23] <rytisone> also you can change from reticle to laser pointer, if you want
[0:32:23] <%GabeSweetMan> NOW you're setting them!
[0:32:24] <%SirGO0SE> re5 is like the garbage pail that you didnt want to take out on trash day and re6 is that same pail next week
[0:32:24] <@commanderclaw> "I need you to blow up this wire fence"
[0:32:24] <Zooperton> blow the chain link fence?
[0:32:25] <jorniev> what why blow it up?
[0:32:26] <%Th3SmartAlec> ...
[0:32:27] <Blank9> this game really is great if you play it like mercenaries
[0:32:27] <%scaryboisupreme> good
[0:32:29] <%YakumoYomi> For some reason, they decided they needed to change the UI for each playable character (two different ones for Jake, if I remember correctly).
[0:32:31] <GUNxSPECTRE> If the rumors are to be believed RE8 is gonna be RE7? So History repeats itself?
[0:32:33] <%doc_ock_rokc> @Th3SmartAlec When mixed with Sherry and Jakes blood yes
[0:32:40] <+Aggro_Will> If I just tuned in and you told me this was a Resident Evil game I'd say "BULLSHIT."
[0:32:42] <%krawtch> WILL YOU REALLY
[0:32:43] <%morcego_cinzento_arts> Now i just noticed that even though Chris has his sidearm on hand, there is still a pistol houstered as part of his skin model
[0:32:43] <primarch_lupercal> he literally sounds like the character destined to die
[0:32:44] <%peachy996> Thanks great blow Fin
[0:32:44] <%Nemesis2098> chris punched a boulder, and coulndt knock over a chain link fence?
[0:32:45] <%valriot> LUL
[0:32:45] <jorniev> el gigante?
[0:32:47] <%th3_magicman> Ah yeah, the HYPEST waiting game
[0:32:47] <+gutlesscoward> so why is this game supposed to be bad
[0:32:49] <@commanderclaw> "You can't just blow up all your problems"
[0:32:53] <Ner234> ??? Not dead ?
[0:32:55] <%peachy996> Yes Finn keep blowing
[0:32:56] <%D3rrtyD4n> atpCap
[0:33:00] <ape_hawk> so is everyone having a good leap day?
[0:33:00] <zeif00> Chris STRONG
[0:33:02] <+Aggro_Will> Like, I'd believe it's MEtal Gear Survive before believing it's Resident Evil.
[0:33:03] <jorniev> that ui is dog shit
[0:33:06] <+dylin456> no way you are blowing a train car out of the way
[0:33:08] <%Th3SmartAlec> @doc_ock_rokc ...okay. I'll just wait for that campaign to see more of that. The idea of Sherry's blood being important makes sense at least
[0:33:10] <%SlimeSlimeSlime> 1.2K, we're doing it!
[0:33:18] <%doc_ock_rokc> C virus is LITERALLY the best logistical virus for Resident evil
[0:33:19] <%th3_magicman> I forgot Metal Gear Survive was a real game
[0:33:20] <%krawtch> Feb 29th is a made up day so this stream doesnt count
[0:33:23] <+ausl0> what an obnoxious menu
[0:33:25] <%NekoUrabe> @ape_hawk I super forgot today was a leap day
[0:33:26] <$Piemono> Why does the game not pause when you adjust the settings?
[0:33:29] <%JJCheeker> Fann Y'pak > Finn
[0:33:29] <%GabeSweetMan> TACTICAL ROLL
[0:33:30] <%Th3SmartAlec> ROLL PogChamp
[0:33:31] <%doc_ock_rokc> @Th3SmartAlec Jakes blood is actually the more important one
[0:33:37] <trianglehat> shoot bang man
[0:33:38] <%krawtch> because its SO REALISTIC
[0:33:41] <%Th3SmartAlec> @doc_ock_rokc That Wesker Progentior juice?
[0:33:42] <%marvel877> ONLINE
[0:33:43] <+Nicholas0123> wesker fucks
[0:33:43] <tigerfang86> REALISM
[0:33:46] <%SirGO0SE> its probably for online
[0:33:47] <biomegabear> its not even an ALWAYS ONLINE game
[0:33:47] <jorniev> because co op pr online
[0:33:47] <shotgang86> to make you feel the HEAT OF THE BATTLE
[0:33:48] <lbrownthedestroyer> co op
[0:33:49] <zeif00> Chris is a psaBig man
[0:33:49] <%arancet> cause online
[0:33:51] <dukenux> THERES NO TIME
[0:33:53] <%KeystoneA1> !uptime
[0:33:54] <GUNxSPECTRE> Please play Sherry in Jake's campaign
[0:33:54] <tiaramaki> Don't you guys liek your REALISM? 4Head
[0:33:54] <+dylin456> so does dark souls suck because u cant pause
[0:33:55] <@Moobot> I've been playing this game for how long? Oh only 33m 56s.
[0:33:55] <%Nemesis2098> LUL
[0:33:56] <%AwesomeDan_> the not pausing for settings bugged the crap out of me.
[0:33:58] <%GabeSweetMan> PARKOUR
[0:34:00] <deadredeyez> online reasons
[0:34:05] <%doc_ock_rokc> @Th3SmartAlec A stable Progeneitor mutation that requires no maitainance
[0:34:05] <biomegabear> @tiaramaki no

[0:34:06] <%Th3SmartAlec> LUL
[0:34:06] <%neVan0> NICE
[0:34:07] <StarvingPenguinGod> bring a knife to a fist fight BrainSlug
[0:34:08] <@commanderclaw> How is on demand melee worse than RE5 melee?
[0:34:11] <%Deft_Thought> EAT YOUR MINTS!
[0:34:17] <%GabeSweetMan> THAT DIDN"T AFFECT YOUR HEALTH
[0:34:20] <dabulousstreams> IF YOU CARRY ON STEPPING ON THESE MENS BOLLOCKS THEY WONT BE ABLE TO HAVE CHILDREN!! NO KIDDIES NO FUTURE!!
[0:34:22] <iwa5h4ck3d> Doesn't pause during menus? This must be the dark souls of re games
[0:34:24] <%th3_magicman> EAT MINT TO SHRUG OFF BOMBS
[0:34:25] <%xUmbraNinja> psaHat psaHat psaHat
[0:34:25] <shotgang86> what even is this run?
[0:34:25] <tiaramaki> @deadredeyez Okay but it should only be that way when online co-op is happening
[0:34:28] <%McCloud90> McCloud90 subscribed with Twitch Prime. They've subscribed for 12 months, currently on a 9 month streak! 
[0:34:29] <%MajorCrasher> why not make the menu pause for offline though? even warframe lets you pause if you play offline
[0:34:29] <%krawtch> breath mints heal my bullet wounds and burns
[0:34:30] <%valriot> THEME OF ACTION
[0:34:30] <%GabeSweetMan> You got blowed up twice but your health was UNPHASED
[0:34:31] <dukenux> i know you guys are joking, but i want to slap anyone trying to argue this game falls under any "realism"
[0:34:36] <%tank7013> Wow that knockdown ate one of the tic-tacs without healing you
[0:34:38] <%marvel877> Man, RE 0 starting to look like a better game now, huh?
[0:34:39] <thelonechris> You shot him so hard, his shirt broke
[0:34:40] <+Pyroclase> they make a very faint chainsaw noise when they disintegrate
[0:34:40] <%tusk102> @commanderclaw bc the on demand melee is weaker and also has a stamina guage
[0:34:41] <%peachy996> Look at this Resident Evil game
[0:34:42] <%NekoUrabe> Bluuue
[0:34:43] <zeif00> Kreygasm Kreygasm
[0:34:45] <+Aggro_Will> This entire series comes from the premise of "Yo, we found this weird flower and had some TERRIBLE ideas of what to do with it!"
[0:34:45] <%neVan0> oooooh~
[0:34:45] <GUNxSPECTRE> This game is way more fun than RE4
[0:34:46] <%Th3SmartAlec> @doc_ock_rokc Oh, it's becuase he's half human half Wesker then?
[0:34:52] <%mister___doctor> Nothings lamer than generic action music
[0:34:54] <Aydarkzero> yep
[0:34:55] <+Pyroclase> @GUNxSPECTRE that's a very strange take
[0:34:57] <%doc_ock_rokc> @Th3SmartAlec yes
[0:34:57] <tigerfang86> yes
[0:34:58] <%Sir_stride> yeah pretty much
[0:34:59] <trashcansan> This has no downtime at all
[0:34:59] <%arancet> @PatStaresAt at what point did you realize RE6 was trash? was it obvious to you pre-release?
[0:34:59] <+Lunarhawk> Pat I cant see anything im blind
[0:34:59] <%Th3SmartAlec> Nice
[0:35:00] <%neVan0> LUL
[0:35:00] <LethalPlacebo> The music in this game fucking sucks and somehow the game is so bad I never noticed.
[0:35:00] <%Fenrirlives> is that Yuri Lowenthal?
[0:35:03] <%Emperor_Machinus> dead
[0:35:04] <REXREVOLVER> this game is the best resident evil game
[0:35:04] <MyNameIsRasus> A really bad one at that
[0:35:04] <Kain5707> Gears of Warish
[0:35:04] <%peachy996> Reminder: This is a Resident Evil game.
[0:35:06] <CloniiCory> Resident Evil 6 is the God of War Ascension of Dead Space 3 tbh.
[0:35:07] <Blank9> slide kicks stagger enemies for real melee
[0:35:07] <%Dead_trickster> Chris with that Isaac Clarke stomp
[0:35:07] <%JJCheeker> Wesker masturbates while looking at himself in mirror
[0:35:08] <biomegabear> battlefiled calls of duties
[0:35:08] <GUNxSPECTRE> @Pyroclase But it's the right one :D
[0:35:09] <%morcego_cinzento_arts> Let it be a reminder that Sherry as a cool young govermant agent with regen abilities without the downside of being a walking ever growing cancer. If forever trapped in this game and we will never ever get her back
[0:35:12] <+dante_must_die_exe> but everyone love the Call of Duty
[0:35:13] <codycurry52> What are you talkin about
[0:35:13] <biomegabear> I DONT
[0:35:13] <%shiplord13> @PatStaresAt More like Gears of War with the monsters
[0:35:14] <trianglehat> biowar has changed
[0:35:14] <Dragon_Batman> All of Chris's campaign in this game is a call of duty mission
[0:35:16] <BigBech> on "protect the dude" segments like this in games, do you guys prefer an actual set time you have to defend or the classic "kill all the dudes"?
[0:35:16] <AMajorTom> People love that game
[0:35:17] <trashcansan> it's all action and no downtime
[0:35:17] <%Deft_Thought> Chris has learned secret gun tech. By being so STRONG and BIG, when he squeezes the trigger, his bullets become MORE POWERFUL!
[0:35:18] <rytisone> Call of Chris
[0:35:19] <%marvel877> TOO MANY COOKS
[0:35:19] <%th3_magicman> Even COD was this level of COD
[0:35:20] <Drusain> thanks yuri
[0:35:22] <%Kegeto> chirs is the call of duty
[0:35:23] <deadredeyez> @tiaramaki "The illusion of co-op" then
[0:35:24] <DarknessD42> This game is gaaaaarbage
[0:35:24] <Psych_man13_13> Kids LOVE CoD
[0:35:24] <dukenux> Chris on Duty
[0:35:25] <%Neo_Kaiser> Did Pat lower the difficulty?
[0:35:26] <biomegabear> 10 year olds love call of duty
[0:35:29] <%KaosMachina> Chris of Duty
[0:35:30] <$Gabe36578> LULW
[0:35:30] <%peachy996> Finn stop talking about Blowies
[0:35:31] <shotgang86> is it biowar or a biocurse?
[0:35:32] <%sjay449> Chris Redfield: Call of Duty Man
[0:35:34] <%bevyrage> aren't they standing right next to the explosive?
[0:35:35] <peachteagaming> how does infinity ward feel about this?
[0:35:36] <%Th3SmartAlec> Isn't it funny how the RPG, the best weapon in RE, is used by standard enemies?
[0:35:37] <LunarRemix> Don't the games always imply that Chris is a CoD Hero though?
[0:35:37] <zeif00> psaBig WESTERN GAME
[0:35:37] <%D3rrtyD4n> i used to think i didnt like re5, but this game puts things into perspective.
[0:35:38] <primarch_lupercal> even cod has more interesting missions
[0:35:41] <dabulousstreams> SHERRY!? I’D LOVE SOME!!

[0:35:46] <%YakumoYomi> Well, at least there are mods for RE2 Remake to turn Claire into Sherry
[0:35:48] <ahbhajit> COVER

[0:36:16] <+ausl0> blow it straight up
[0:36:18] <codycurry52> That UI is great! I don't know anything
[0:36:18] <%bevyrage> an explosive set on the SIDE of the vehicle made it jump UP in place???
[0:36:20] <%krawtch> Tony Hawk's Pro Traincar 4
[0:36:22] <+Aggro_Will> Resident Evil could get a whole new generation of fans if they just made it like Fortnite. Could you imagine a Fortnite game with zombies?
[0:36:22] <rytisone> cause cheats
[0:36:22] <%peachy996> This is so gray it's alwmost White
[0:36:23] <GUNxSPECTRE> Sherry when

[0:36:47] <+Aggro_Will> @pyroclase IT'S LITERALLY JUST FORTNITE
[0:36:48] <Brigins> Pat, blink twice if you are being held at gun point to play this game and need help.
[0:36:48] <Ner234> C A T
[0:36:49] <jijipose> If you are going to use a tank, why not just use regular army guys?
[0:36:49] <REXREVOLVER> this is the best co-op game
[0:36:50] <%Th3SmartAlec> ONE GUY
[0:36:51] <%Neo_Kaiser> You have to save him cause Chris is all about his teammates
[0:36:51] <%YakumoYomi> He scream

[0:37:05] <Aydarkzero> @ahbhajit true bio terror
[0:37:05] <+Aggro_Will> At least, Fortnite before they added battle royale.
[0:37:07] <GUNxSPECTRE> Sherry and Jake make the best pair no doubt in this game
[0:37:08] <$HyperionXV> Why do the zombies have 50 RPGs but the soldiers have none to deal with the tank?

[0:37:58] <%rumtumtugnutz> There is no DmC 2. And they skipped Devil May Cry 2.
[0:37:58] <CloniiCory> I wish I didn't remember anything about DMC2, but yes I do remember the tank.
[0:38:00] <%Conyst> they didn't make a DMC2 they skipped to 3

[0:38:59] <REXREVOLVER> RE6 is the best resident evil game you cowards
[0:39:01] <%Th3SmartAlec> GUM GUM ROCKET
[0:39:02] <%CommanderSqueaks> Okay, that design is so goofy I kind of love it.
[0:39:02] <Ner234> tbh they are kinda cool
[0:39:02] <Jetsfantasy> WTF is this bug militia?
[0:39:03] <%Deft_Thought> I remember the shield guys but not the centipede guys
[0:39:03] <MyNameIsRasus> like a LEG
[0:39:03] <+JoeSketchy> Oh my god... I forgot about the FUCKING GRASSHOPPER ENEMIES!!!!!!
[0:39:03] <Darkfire346> YA THINK
[0:39:04] <PRocci18> @morcego_cinzento_arts I know I know was just being facetious :)
[0:39:04] <+gutlesscoward> was that like one punch?
[0:39:06] <%Helmed> re6 made ARMS?
[0:39:11] <MayorRev> It's so nice to see Pat finally playing Spec Ops The Line
[0:39:11] <%alexandrecau> leon has more kicks
[0:39:12] <biomegabear> This place reminds me of a resonance of fate boss
[0:39:13] <Jolnir> getting shot in a cutscene
[0:39:17] <jorniev> THOSE FUCKS FORM CVERONICA
[0:39:18] <%krawtch> dont you like when the cutscene triggers in the middle of fighting a guy
[0:39:19] <dukenux> fucking SAGAT over here r
[0:39:19] <nademonkey1100> that was not a t42
[0:39:20] <Ner234> DED
[0:39:23] <thelonechris> Yote
[0:39:24] <%sjay449> "Do you feel like a Hero Chris?"
[0:39:24] <%Deft_Thought> Didn't Piers just say he needed a bigger gun?
[0:39:26] <%CommanderSqueaks> @MayorRev Dammit, I know it's bait but that made me so mad to see.
[0:39:26] <Psych_man13_13> Man, this shit is part of why people hated capcom back then
[0:39:26] <@commanderclaw> This is fine
[0:39:26] <%bevyrage> why aren't these guys using the turrets that are pointed AT you?
[0:39:36] <dabulousstreams> GO FOR A SWIM!
[0:39:38] <+Aggro_Will> Is it ever explained how Chris/Leon/any named character doesn't get super infected INSTANTLY?
[0:39:38] <%doc_ock_rokc> Why the C virus is possibly the best virus. Base C makes zombie hoard which is non infectious and burns up over time. Injected C virus makes bioweapons means you don't need to clone hunters/tyrants and makes Plagas like monsters J'vos are plagas without UV weakness If they could work around the heating to the point of setting themselves on fire weakness it would be the ULTIMATE BIO WEAPON
[0:39:39] <daisyyyy> i just realized, this is the RE game for people who've only seen the movies
[0:39:39] <%rumtumtugnutz> This game is liquid hot molten trash
[0:39:41] <maxpasta> Try a Chidori!
[0:39:42] <%Ascethetic> Man, the new Gears of Evil looks bland
[0:39:42] <%Th3SmartAlec> "isn't Captain Redfield suffering from PTSD and should really see a doctor and advisor?" "shut up"
[0:39:42] <%vectorless_peon> why cant i find a nice girl with a centipede arm
[0:39:43] <Jetsfantasy> Thats kind of a leisurely brisk run
[0:39:44] <myriad_truth> He blew it up
[0:39:44] <+Mitchellsocks> If I were Chris Redfield, I would simply PUNCH the enemy
[0:39:45] <%D3rrtyD4n> and bullets dont work either
[0:39:50] <%Zaphire_Saucypants> guess they wanted you to use those turrets
[0:39:52] <%Deft_Thought> Is the game falling apart because Chris is too Strong?
[0:39:53] <codycurry52> we're gonna need a bigger BOW
[0:39:55] <natebud> Piers has an anti-tankr ifle, i guess it makes sense sorta
[0:39:56] <+Mitchellsocks> Also this is just the half life 2 bridge
[0:40:02] <@commanderclaw> Look inbetween the walls
[0:40:05] <Aydarkzero> don't worry man you'll find her one day
[0:40:07] <Higaraishi> you gotta look under rocks
[0:40:07] <%Th3SmartAlec> Suplex the train Chris
[0:40:08] <maxpasta> Use your sharingan Sasuke!
[0:40:08] <%shiplord13> Try a mad science convention
[0:40:09] <+gutlesscoward> why can't I find a nice centipede with a girl arm
[0:40:09] <%D00msDayDan> well there's that one guy that drew a centipede girl
[0:40:10] <%SirGO0SE> Centipedes? In MY vagina?!

[0:40:15] <shotgang86> YEET

[0:50:47] <%Jekado> why not use the AA guns?
[0:50:47] <eco419> I asked for this :)
[0:50:48] <natebud> Pat you need to get your nitpicks in order. This is getting out of hand.

[0:50:58] <$Daisuke89> Paige ok??
[0:51:00] <egmrios> Chris' campaign is cool, it's not that bad as is Jakes. Leon and Ada are terrible and the game controls terribly.

[0:51:14] <%Valdorick> Reminder: If you pay Pat something to play something better, he will thank you for your money, and then NOT free you or anyone else from their torment.

[0:51:21] <+Pyroclase> killing him is optional afaik
[0:51:22] <myriad_truth> You got jump on the monster!!
[0:51:22] <katocrimson> Is the voice of Sherry the same as Monster Hunter Handler?
[0:51:23] <%Th3SmartAlec> Oh no, are Jake and Sherry the only characters with a bit of personality in this game?
[0:51:25] <gamezerox> Paige just got buster wolfed
[0:51:25] <ScreamLord> @PatStaresAt So these guys can regenerate half their skulls being blown open but twisting their neck is an instant kill?

[0:51:38] <%heartlesshealer> God I hope Paige busts in with the results of that story and we can turn down the volume again
[0:51:38] <%Sir_stride> no you can actually kill him
[0:51:39] <%Bane_Kaikyo> Seriouysly tho, how has this game not given you ANY healing items at all?
[0:51:40] <%FunkyRib> Can't we all just pretend that you completed RE6 already, so you can move on to the next game in the series? :3
[0:51:40] <%juxtest> Wait a minute, these aren't BoWs. They're just Russians

[0:56:02] <CloniiCory> RE6's only redeeming quality is how hot everyone is. And in a horror game that should come secondary.
[0:56:04] <%tusk102> @PatStaresAt the monster kept hitting him which is why he couldn't set it. you were supposed to keep it from slapping him
[0:56:06] <%krawtch> blap

[0:56:42] <%optimasmaximas> @Th3SmartAlec i actually like a couple of the "character motivation" moments coming up next chapter, and a retread of that leech section in chapter 4
[0:56:42] <+TDotGoat> those were some fast charges there
[0:56:43] <%CommanderSqueaks> If they pulled out 3D Maneuver Gear it'd be pretty sick.
[0:56:43] <%doc_ock_rokc> Okay thats more then just kicking the door in

[0:57:11] <SkyPirateArcane> Wow this music is straight ass good lord
[0:57:11] <CrimsonCore90> This is waste of time music.
[0:57:11] <%JJCheeker> this music sucks
[0:57:13] <dukenux> Clown Fart Remix
[0:57:13] <deltakuma009> why does Chris look like an older version of Alex from SH Downcoming?
[0:57:14] <%sporeian94> I've heard stock action music better than this ost
[0:57:15] <%SirGO0SE> DOO DOO
[0:57:16] <%peachy996> It just loops
[0:57:17] <%Th3SmartAlec> THIS IS MY JAM
[0:57:18] <nuane> this stock music
[0:57:18] <%doc_ock_rokc> @black_pariah I have changed the game pray that I don't change it further
[0:57:19] <GamingPhobic> i love the cinematically seizing camera
[0:57:20] <+yolothewizard> Finn seems like the Johnny Sasaki of the group

[0:57:28] <%VashyronM> Do you feel the suspense? DO YOU?
[0:57:29] <%thetrashman_sc> SourPls
[0:57:30] <%CommanderSqueaks> This sounds like a Chinese bootleg of One Winged Angel.
[0:57:30] <%Huntercd> Why destroy the things that could be used to kill them?
[0:57:30] <%JJCheeker> What's with the psycho rip off
[0:57:31] <Dragon_Batman> Piers deserved that one
[0:57:31] <%Zaphire_Saucypants> sounds like one a Monster Movie reject, music wise.
[0:57:31] <eco419> Pat noooooo
[0:57:33] <%heartlesshealer> YEAH
[0:57:35] <CloniiCory> The door clearing makes me think of Republic Commando, but then this music immediately reminds me this is no Republic Commando.
[0:57:37] <%BioHunter> it gets worse
[0:57:37] <codycurry52> Rev 1 is way better
[0:57:37] <seniortrump> is it
[0:57:40] <digsby> Is Revelations bad on its own?
[0:57:43] <MyNameIsRasus> At least Revelations had some sweet ass
[0:57:44] <%heartlesshealer> EVEN THE BULK AND SKULL GUYS

[0:57:57] <%Th3SmartAlec> ....
[0:57:57] <%JJCheeker> my god this is headache inducing
[0:57:58] <doster504> This is music I'd expect in a LEGO Resident Evil game
[0:57:59] <codycurry52> Jill parts of Rev 1 are good
[0:58:01] <myriad_truth> YOU SHOULDA KILLED IT
[0:58:01] <Drusain> Remember when Capcom blamed marketing when RE6 sales sucked?
[0:58:02] <%th3_magicman> psaWhat psaWhat psaWhat
[0:58:03] <nademonkey1100> and you know i actually liked re 5 coop but my god this is just fucking bad
[0:58:05] <%VashyronM> Eat a tic tac
[0:58:07] <+Walopoh> Damn, should have saw that one coming
[0:58:07] <Dutchpotato> LMAO
[0:58:07] <%Aracon_> this is the dumbest4
[0:58:08] <%Meekest> Pat this is Resident Evil
[0:58:09] <%Huntercd> Revilations was better than this
[0:58:13] <%optimasmaximas> @Th3SmartAlec im actually polaying it for the first time and im staying enough ahead of pat to enjoy each stream lol, but i do know things and clips that were memed from the future chapters LUL
[0:58:15] <%JusTTheGuyYouNeed> Reminder that This game is the most sold game of the entire franchise
[0:58:16] <%Zaphire_Saucypants> re5 coop is fuckin great
[0:58:16] <+Pyroclase> RE6 sold great though, didn't it?
[0:58:20] <biomegabear> THANK GOD 7 WAS GOOD
[0:58:20] <dan_g_v> hey chat peoples, how is it going? Are we winning, son?
[0:58:20] <%maskofmichael> Were are we going?
[0:58:20] <KeiPrime> re6 sales sucked? it's the third top selling CAPCOM game
[0:58:23] <eco419> Consume the tic tac
[0:58:24] <%doc_ock_rokc> @Drusain Thats a common buisness technique
[0:58:25] <%thetrashman_sc> yeah if revelations was just on the boat it'd be pretty neat
[0:58:25] <%mMayrro> remember when videos games?
[0:58:30] <%mikesapartment> elmo mad cute
[0:58:32] <GamingPhobic> you absolute idiot, you walked down an empty hallway not expecting instant death
[0:58:32] <trashcansan> psaElmo
[0:58:34] <jijipose> Elmo needs to continue the Redfield Bloodline
[0:58:38] <%CommanderSqueaks> yaaaa......
[0:58:38] <%peachy996> RE6 selling that high is depressing
[0:58:40] <%BioHunter> re6 sold a lot but not enough for capcom at the time
[0:58:40] <MyNameIsRasus> this music sucks
[0:58:42] <%honeyman18> this looks like the most boring shit to play
[0:58:43] <%TheNewJapanGuy> Elmo SHOULD be mad.
[0:58:46] <CrypticMochi> What were the returns though?
[0:58:47] <+Walopoh> Where is the fun even supposed to be LUL
[0:58:47] <dan_g_v> I made it
[0:58:48] <CloniiCory> RE6 sold great. It just didn't sell COD numbers like they wanted.
[0:58:48] <%optimasmaximas> @Th3SmartAlec like there's a bunch of stupid shit in sherry and jake
[0:58:50] <nuane> Dark Evil
[0:58:50] <%JJCheeker> It sounds like the music is broken
[0:58:51] <KeiPrime> i dont know what capcom were thinkin
[0:58:52] <%SirGO0SE> It's fucking astonishing Resident Evil was a successful franchise. Most of the series is mediocre or terrible. Out of the entire series 1/2/3/4/5/Revelations/REmake/RER2/7 are classics. The rest are middling to trash.
[0:58:54] <%mMayrro> great great great
[0:58:54] <%sporeian94> Remember when this series was just "we're stuck in some creepy mansion and the woods and there's like 18 zombies running around"
[0:58:56] <jijipose> This music is bad too
[0:58:59] <thelonechris> It's the same loop over and over again
[0:59:00] <%arancet> maybe it sold a lot overall, but not at debut/full price?
[0:59:01] <KeiPrime> or what they expected, maybe too fuckin much
[0:59:03] <+Skelegroove> Capcom was surprised when Revelations reviewed better than this
[0:59:06] <+lethallylactic> lionFlood This music lionFlood
[0:59:08] <%scaryboisupreme> I tuned out is this shit still happening
[0:59:08] <%Aracon_> even the music is garbage
[0:59:09] <AMajorTom> Man, classic RE action
[0:59:10] <%snow_bush> Holy Crap this soundtrack is crap
[0:59:11] <%Th3SmartAlec> @optimasmaximas I missed a lot of RE6 context (makes sense now considering a whole bunch of nothing is happening), but I do know there's a slight bit of creeping on Sherry
[0:59:12] <Dragon_Batman> The intrigue was there, it was only too late to realize it was bad
[0:59:15] <%BioHunter> that combined with bad reviews, it actually hurt the series
[0:59:15] <Hellarussian> this is a good Gears of War game
[0:59:16] <%Huntercd> Is Inafune to blame for this?
[0:59:16] <codycurry52> re6 is NOT the best selling re game
[0:59:17] <ScreamLord> Remember when RE was good?
[0:59:26] <digsby> Remember when zombified dogs were an exciting scary threat?
[0:59:26] <biomegabear> GEARS OF WAR
[0:59:28] <Pwgregory> At least this game has good music?
[0:59:29] <KeiPrime> no, RE5 is
[0:59:32] <%thetrashman_sc> LOOK AT THIS BULLSHIT
[0:59:32] <%vectorless_peon> who would want to see a "The Thing" game remake done by capcom in the same level of quality/fedelity as REmake2 and hopefully REmake3?\
[0:59:33] <+restivewolf> this is true suffering and it has only just begun Kappa
[0:59:34] <karl_rex> Is that the Cave Troll from LOTR?
[0:59:35] <jijipose> Remember how RE got good again?
[0:59:35] <CrowbarFacelift> I can feel the horror
[0:59:38] <%thetrashman_sc> LUL
[0:59:38] <nuane> @Pwgregory no it doesn't
[0:59:38] <%CommanderSqueaks> YEYEYEYE
[0:59:39] <GamingPhobic> OH
[0:59:39] <ahbhajit> RE6 sold a shit ton, Capcom had unreal;istic expectations for it so it "underperformed"

[1:13:37] <%krawtch> i DID notice this game is made from 85% recycled material.
[1:13:37] <+Walopoh> this game is fascinating
[1:13:42] <%Th3SmartAlec> @lord_ludence He's doing GREAT
[1:13:44] <SlimeBoogey> you're telling me they reused assets from previous titles? no way
[1:13:47] <%EuropanLamprey> Almost
[1:13:48] <MyNameIsRasus> @Jekado LUL
[1:13:52] <%heartlesshealer> Reduce, Reuse, and Recycle
[1:13:52] <%doc_ock_rokc> So is RE5
[1:13:53] <Kain5707> @PatStaresAt why is this the best RE game though? Kappa
[1:13:53] <%SuperSonichu> honestly "goop zombies" is p fucking boring by RE standars
[1:13:55] <C24U> Pat doesn't understand how model skeletal framework works

[1:14:15] <%Th3SmartAlec> HIT THE BACK
[1:14:15] <+Starlight_Gamer> ez
[1:14:16] <natebud> You can't really reuse animations on a completely different model even if it is human shaped
[1:14:17] <wrydiculous> yes only the back
[1:14:17] <deltakuma009> the letter of the day is "B" for bullshit
[1:14:18] <%Sir_stride> @dragon_batman yeah but it was an actual el giante
[1:14:24] <shotgang86> *piccolo's voice* DODGE
[1:14:31] <kn1gh75> it feels like the game is being made as you play it
[1:14:31] <%Th3SmartAlec> What's that guy doing
[1:14:33] <%ChaosAethr> It looks like this part of the game took inspiration from Gears of War 1
[1:14:33] <wrydiculous> these asshats are inredibly tanky everywhere else
[1:14:34] <+lethallylactic> NotLikeThis
[1:14:35] <%JJCheeker> damn how many more are there
[1:14:37] <Xenodile> I know that RE has never cared about conservation of mass, but these big chunky armored trolls crawling out of human shaped cocoons really is just too much.
[1:14:37] <%Th3SmartAlec> Of course
[1:14:39] <+dante_must_die_exe> so many i frames
[1:14:44] <%vectorless_peon> i miss the fleash transformer senitor now at least that was dumb in a visually fun way

[1:14:55] <%studleydoorite> I KNEW it wouldn't work, that's why I did it
[1:14:58] <C24U> MELEE WHEN THEY STAGGER
[1:15:02] <Dragon_Batman> @Sir_stride True but Capcom has re used so much in a bunch of things, it's not surprising really

[1:16:23] <natebud> wha
[1:16:24] <Dragon_Batman> @Sir_stride Exactly, honestly I'm not bothered by the re use at all, there are waaay more problems with this game than trying to save money.

[1:17:52] <silverira> NO HANDCUFFS?
[1:17:53] <Monkeyweed21> BITCH ARE YOU FOR REAL
[1:17:54] <R3TURNoftheMACK> JUST ASK PIERS THEN
[1:17:54] <+kingcroix> has chris and leon spoken in any of the games?
[1:17:54] <%Aracon_> he had to have
[1:17:54] <%Sir_stride> so this game has been retconned to be non canon, right?
[1:17:55] <%sporeian94> Finn you stay on top of her buddy. Don't be afraid to ride her... hard!
[1:17:55] <Xenodile> "Neo-Umbrella? Surely that has nothing to do with Umbrella."
[1:17:55] <dukenux> @Sir_stride no, she has a scarf Kappa
[1:17:55] <KeiPrime> send the rookie to handle the clearly shady evil lady with the tiddie hanging out
[1:17:56] <natebud> Did he though?
[1:17:58] <nuane> Leon can keep a secret Kappa
[1:18:00] <%heartlesshealer> Leon told nobody anything
[1:18:00] <%studleydoorite> SHE'S GOT A GUN
[1:18:01] <%SilverJakler> SHE HAS A GUN
[1:18:01] <Sammang> Wait so then after neo umbrella, Umbrella became a humanitarian company in 7?
[1:18:02] <myriad_truth> Leon told NOBODY
[1:18:03] <%alexandrecau> Leon told no one
[1:18:03] <%DukeMoose> why would they let her have a gun?
[1:18:04] <Dragon_Batman> And he thought she was dead
[1:18:05] <C24U> Claire NEVER met Ada
[1:18:05] <+Pyroclase> Does Leon know Chris though? Aside from through Claire.
[1:18:05] <+Sushi2k> did he tho
[1:18:07] <%Modren83> Chris didn't read the report
[1:18:07] <%Tearonex> @PatStaresAt Chris and Leon don't talk to each other at all, you know this
[1:18:07] <%Th3SmartAlec> DID LEON NOT PUT ADA IN THE REPORT?!
[1:18:09] <%peachy996> "Keep her safe, Twink. Bottom, keep an eye on her"
[1:18:10] <%Literal___Nobody> Kill her now Chris. For the Bloodline
[1:18:10] <%krawtch> nobody talks ever
[1:18:12] <%Meekest> Claire and Chris haven't spoken since before RE2
[1:18:13] <KeiPrime> BUT BOOBY SHUT UP
[1:18:14] <%alexandrecau> it was his non sexual conquest
[1:18:14] <%MrBorisMakarov> SHE HAS A GUN WTF
[1:18:15] <%D3rrtyD4n> there was no time
[1:18:15] <MyNameIsRasus> SURE DIDN'T
[1:18:16] <%arancet> they talked about sherry!
[1:18:18] <%Aracon_> there's NO WAY chris didn't become privy to this knowledge
[1:18:19] <iwa5h4ck3d> He has amnesia from the beginning
[1:18:19] <Pwgregory> Leon thought she was dead until Europe right?
[1:18:20] <+Blargimazombie> He knows Sherry
[1:18:21] <SlimeBoogey> claire never met ada
[1:18:21] <%snow_bush> Just like sex, people don't talk.
[1:18:23] <%SaiyanShoto> This game says otherwise
[1:18:23] <$PhantomMiG> @patstaresat No Pat Re character never talk to each other
[1:18:23] <myriad_truth> Leon told NO ONE about Ada!
[1:18:24] <Grennold> Leon doesn't write about Ada in his report that Chris read before RE5 LuL
[1:18:24] <silverira> NO TIME
[1:18:25] <natebud> You just complained about him knowing Sherry though.
[1:18:26] <%Meekest> You know it didn't
[1:18:28] <KeiPrime> CVX DID NOT HAPPEN
[1:18:29] <C24U> CLAIRE NEVER MET ADA
[1:18:30] <%michingmallecho> Was there time? Nooooo
[1:18:30] <%Quigsies> Is that the script?
[1:18:30] <%Th3SmartAlec> Shouldn;t the Kennedy Report talk about Ada?!
[1:18:30] <MyNameIsRasus> NO TIME
[1:18:32] <thetruenicster> @PatStaresAt why would Claire or Leon tell Chris about Ada
[1:18:32] <biomegabear> BUT CVX IS NOT CANNON
[1:18:32] <luckycloud91> he forgot ok
[1:18:34] <LunarRemix> Did it now/
[1:18:35] <+Starlight_Gamer> prove it
[1:18:36] <jijipose> Claire told him, but Chris could only think about Leon getting his sister pregnant
[1:18:36] <KeiPrime> WHERES STEVE THEN
[1:18:36] <Darkfire346> I REFUSE TO BELIEVE CVX HAPPENED
[1:18:38] <%doc_ock_rokc> @Literal___Nobody make it look like an accident
[1:18:40] <%Sir_stride> just run pat
[1:18:41] <%peachy996> Barry at least tells the sandwhich story to Claire
[1:18:42] <%Aracon_> EVERYONE should be in on the lore
[1:18:42] <%Zaphire_Saucypants> I think you're supposed to run
[1:18:42] <%heartlesshealer> The CVX knife happened, I'll buy it
[1:18:42] <Dragon_Batman> And Claire has no reason to say hey there was this woman I never met
[1:18:43] <%sniffy77> surely she was menioned in the kennedy report
[1:18:43] <wrydiculous> oh boy this part
[1:18:44] <DesuDesuDokiDoki> Leon is a well known ADA hoarder
[1:18:44] <+Pyroclase> Chris speicfically mentions reading "The kennedy report" in RE4 so he'd know about Ada for sure
[1:18:44] <DracaenaLeaf> CVX is the real RE3
[1:18:45] <%doc_ock_rokc> Ho shit
[1:18:45] <+tweedler92> Leon could not report morally Grey Ada
[1:18:46] <Djinnazz> why not just go to the front door and bottle neck them.
[1:18:47] <wrydiculous> just run
[1:18:47] <Zebroneath> They literally catch up in CVX or shortly after.
[1:18:49] <+Irridium> Christ literally said in an earlier cutscene claire told him all about sherry
[1:18:50] <%Huntercd> She must die for the Redfield bloodline.
[1:18:50] <myriad_truth> TOld you you could punch it
[1:18:51] <thelonechris> Just punch them all
[1:18:51] <+Walopoh> Did it happen though? LUL
[1:18:53] <MyNameIsRasus> That was kinda cool
[1:18:53] <DesuDesuDokiDoki> LUL
[1:18:56] <GarettLefebvre> he knows of the presidents daughter, massive shock
[1:18:57] <%D3rrtyD4n> lol
[1:18:57] <Pillagius> Pat, not only that, Leon probably was de-briefed on what the hell happened in Raccoon city same as Chris. Both probably as they rose in rank got more info on that insident as well
[1:18:58] <%alexandrecau> @Th3SmartAlec Leon omitted Ada's name to not get her arrested
[1:18:58] <trianglehat> can't you just leave? or is fleeing too dangerous?
[1:18:58] <%JJCheeker> he forgot... Just like Danny forgot about the iron fleet
[1:19:03] <%TheMattman1313> No one in the RE universe apparently talks to each other about details. They just read the official reports.
[1:19:04] <%SilverJakler> How is Ada on their frequency?
[1:19:05] <+tangoragahn> Now its time for the BSAA to cuff and take her into custody so she doesn't endanger the mission
[1:19:06] <KeiPrime> I WATCHEd it HAppen DONt tTell me IT didNT HAPPEn
[1:19:08] <Dragon_Batman> The only time Chris would know about Ada was from RE4
[1:19:10] <wrydiculous> unless you want more skill points just run
[1:19:12] <ahbhajit> pat why
[1:19:12] <%krawtch> im sure Wong isn't a very common name among asian women
[1:19:12] <RICE02> Leon obviously wouldnt have reported Ada
[1:19:13] <Kain5707> FUN
[1:19:15] <%MajorCrasher> why would they not talk about the mercenary woman who tried to run off with the g virus?
[1:19:16] <%doc_ock_rokc> @SilverJakler spy
[1:19:22] <DrkJP520> Just backhand these virus behemoths
[1:19:23] <%mMayrro> LUL
[1:19:23] <%D3rrtyD4n> THAT WAS SICK
[1:19:24] <KeiPrime> holy shit
[1:19:24] <DesuDesuDokiDoki> LUL LUL
[1:19:26] <%Th3SmartAlec> @alexandrecau Good job Leon. Id like to think he felt great knowing that RE5 is all Ada's fault
[1:19:26] <%neVan0> LUL
[1:19:26] <%Sir_stride> LUL
[1:19:28] <oruandrew> LUL
[1:19:30] <Dragon_Batman> Because they thought Ada died
[1:19:32] <CraZ80> AIR COMBO
[1:19:33] <%mjkenney24> um
[1:19:33] <%krawtch> that looked badass getting spiked out of the air like that
[1:19:34] <$floralkami> you got backhanded back
[1:19:35] <%michingmallecho> Backslapping giant zombie monsters. Sure
[1:19:36] <%D3rrtyD4n> punched in mid-air LUL
[1:19:38] <theaterunderground> this sucks
[1:19:39] <%doc_ock_rokc> Is Clare even know about Ada?
[1:19:44] <Pillagius> BSAA emblem!
[1:19:44] <DesuDesuDokiDoki> THOT ADA
[1:19:45] <%heartlesshealer> okay, jumping in the air to get propelled is pretty cool
[1:19:48] <digsby> Emblemmm
[1:19:48] <MyNameIsRasus> Chat, RE7 is good right?
[1:19:50] <Dragon_Batman> In RE2?
[1:19:52] <%Aracon_> why would anyone think she died
[1:19:52] <C24U> Leon thought Ada died
[1:19:53] <%MrBorisMakarov> atpRtsd
[1:19:54] <thetruenicster> Yes They Did
[1:19:55] <+Irridium> RE7's great
[1:19:56] <+Sushi2k> HOW DO YOU KNOW LEON TOLD ANYONE ABOUT HER?
[1:19:56] <tiaramaki> BUT RE4 HAPPENED
[1:19:57] <%doc_ock_rokc> Does clare even know Ada?
[1:19:57] <%MajorCrasher> yeah, but even so, they still should have mentioned her, she was pretty badass
[1:19:57] <%peachy996> But Leon knows Ada is alive in RE4
[1:19:57] <%JJCheeker> He forgot
[1:19:57] <%Zaphire_Saucypants> re7 is good, yes
[1:19:58] <%AnthroMetal> just checking in, when was the last time we heard pat breathe?
[1:19:58] <ahbhajit> @MyNameIsRasus Yes

[1:20:03] <nuane> BUT RE4
[1:20:04] <%Literal___Nobody> RE4 has happened
[1:20:04] <+Pyroclase> I just mentioned that!
[1:20:04] <%YakumoYomi> RE7 is great
[1:20:05] <MyNameIsRasus> Ok, just checking
[1:20:05] <Monkeyweed21> CHRIS AND LEON KNOW EACH OTHER
[1:20:06] <%EuropanLamprey> Even if they did, shouldn't that still be in the report
[1:20:06] <%Deft_Thought> SHUT UP
[1:20:07] <biomegabear> YEAH
[1:20:07] <%Aracon_> oh my god
[1:20:08] <%Th3SmartAlec> @PatStaresAt Did Leon put Ada's name in the Report?
[1:20:08] <CloniiCory> RE7 is awesome.
[1:20:08] <%Meekest> THERES NO TIME
[1:20:08] <silverira> NO TIME
[1:20:09] <Nekros4442> Yes
[1:20:11] <Pillagius> YES!
[1:20:11] <TafferAA> yes
[1:20:11] <%Aracon_> OH MY GOD YEAH

[1:20:13] <DesuDesuDokiDoki> oh yeah
[1:20:13] <Dutchpotato> If she died she mighta as well not existed
[1:20:13] <+Starlight_Gamer> yeah
[1:20:15] <Kelevara> ye
[1:20:16] <@commanderclaw> Leon never mentioned Ada
[1:20:16] <%Sir_stride> Leon probably lied about Ada
[1:20:17] <%Deft_Thought> Shut your fucking mouth, bro
[1:20:19] <%heartlesshealer> Leon loves Ada, so he doesn't report about her
[1:20:20] <MyNameIsRasus> HE DID SAY THAT
[1:20:21] <+Lunarhawk> Leon loves Ada he wouldnt fucking include her in his report cause he doesnt want people to know about his bae
[1:20:22] <%Dementedpenguin> Shhhhhhhhhhh. Kappa
[1:20:22] <%JJCheeker> Maybe he kept that to himself
[1:20:23] <%Literal___Nobody> LEON AND CHRIS KNOW EACH OTHER
[1:20:23] <%alexandrecau> Leon did not talk about Ada on the report
[1:20:23] <%krawtch> Leon didnt put Ada in the report because he'd be too embarrassed to admit he lost the sample because of the hot lady
[1:20:24] <Dragon_Batman> That would be the only time She would come up
[1:20:26] <myriad_truth> Leon wanted to PROTECT ADA
[1:20:26] <PrettyThickandStrongDyck> Was Ada EVER mentioned in Leons report?
[1:20:26] <RICE02> Kennedy Report left out Ada
[1:20:27] <nuane> it's raw
[1:20:27] <%doc_ock_rokc> Leon didn't report her
[1:20:27] <%Deft_Thought> To be honest, I doubt Leon would ever mention Ada
[1:20:28] <Gr4ndm4rsh4ll> I was literally about to say THE KENNEDY REPORT
[1:20:28] <%xUmbraNinja> SHUT UP THO
[1:20:29] <silverira> YOU DONT UNDERSTAND PAT THERE IS NO TIME
[1:20:30] <%michingmallecho> I remember
[1:20:30] <codycurry52> why would Claire who didn't met Ada tell Chris about her?
[1:20:30] <wrightlight94> Leon never mentioned Ada
[1:20:30] <thetruenicster> Pat, Why the hell would Leon mention Ada in his report?
[1:20:30] <Pwgregory> Did he say he read that specific report?
[1:20:32] <%Th3SmartAlec> ADA TOOK A LAS PLAGAS FOR FUCKS SAKE LEON
[1:20:32] <GarettLefebvre> Leon left his bang nuddy out of the report
[1:20:33] <luckycloud91> CHRIS WAS DRUNK MAN
[1:20:34] <%EuropanLamprey> Resident Evil 6: Don't think about it
[1:20:34] <%AnthroMetal> fucking, just, we out
[1:20:34] <%Valdorick> "Report*S*" more than one, HE DID A REPORT ON RE2 TOO
[1:20:34] <DesuDesuDokiDoki> smooth
[1:20:35] <%TheMattman1313> @PatStaresAt Clearly Leon didn't mention Ada because he's too in love.
[1:20:35] <Sammang> Leon didn't think Ada was important
[1:20:36] <rytisone> Leon didn't mention Ada
[1:20:37] <%tank7013> @Th3SmartAlec Shit like that is exactly why I hate Leon and Ada together. He turns into the dumbest piece of shit every time she's around
[1:20:37] <Dutchpotato> Not important
[1:20:39] <Explodincatz> wat
[1:20:39] <Grennold> Doesn't want anyone to know about his one true love 4Head
[1:20:40] <%VashyronM> You are assuming Leon reported Ada's presence. Clearly, he didn't
[1:20:41] <%Sausious> the report leon wrote he definatrely wouldnt include Ada in?
[1:20:42] <Djinnazz> He might have not mentioned her.
[1:20:44] <%The_Chris27> But you already used like 5 grenades
[1:20:45] <%mMayrro> is no one gonna ask why and how she knew about that?
[1:20:45] <TheyCallMeVawn> Leon didnt mention Ada
[1:20:45] <%Admiral_PopnFresh> shudup Ada
[1:20:47] <%goose_attack_almanac> Maybe Leon never recorded her picture
[1:20:48] <SlimeBoogey> leon omits ada to prevent her from being tracked down
[1:20:48] <snekUrgentPls> "ma'AM"
[1:20:49] <SleepyMaribo> Did Leon leave Ada out of the report, cuz he wants to smash that puss?
[1:20:49] <%JJCheeker> He was too embarrassed that she took the sample
[1:20:49] <MyNameIsRasus> MA'AM
[1:20:50] <Drusain> Ada took the sample of course it was in the report
[1:20:50] <CraZ80> @PatStaresAt Leon didn't mention Ada?
[1:20:51] <%MajorCrasher> M'am this is a wendy's
[1:20:51] <SchroedingersFerret> ma'am
[1:20:51] <%Dead_trickster> "Ma'am, STFU"
[1:20:52] <%maskofmichael> Did they give Ada a gun?
[1:20:52] <silverira> BITCH PLEASE
[1:20:52] <Kisiel250> Did Leon lie about Ada in both cases?
[1:20:53] <+Starlight_Gamer> LUL
[1:20:53] <natebud> Would leon leave Ada out of the report? Htat'd be stupid
[1:20:53] <SlimeBoogey> weird love thing

[1:20:54] <%YakumoYomi> LIZARDMAN
[1:20:54] <%Erimos> We about to give Ada a hard time Kappa
[1:20:54] <%D3rrtyD4n> JURASSIC PARK
[1:20:55] <Dragon_Batman> Also Leon could have covered her up

[1:20:56] <nuane> maam please just shut the fuck up
[1:20:57] <%Meekest> Very
[1:20:58] <manoshake> @patstaresat Leon is doing all he can to hide ada's existence
[1:20:58] <DrkJP520> Ada touched Leon's wiener once so he doesn't want to rat her out.
[1:20:58] <%Zaphire_Saucypants> I am
[1:20:59] <%Aracon_> I AM VERY CONFUSED
[1:20:59] <%JJCheeker> So he lied
[1:20:59] <+lethallylactic> LUL

[1:21:02] <%alexandrecau> Leon said hunk stole the virus
[1:21:02] <%MrBorisMakarov> no shut up
[1:21:02] <Pillagius> Pat, considering this game came out around when DMC: Devil May Cry came out - Capcom probably didn't givbe a fuck at that period...
[1:21:03] <%mMayrro> C IS FOR CONVENIENT
[1:21:03] <thelonechris> What the fuck? It's the dino that killed Newman

[1:21:08] <Sammang> No it makes perfect sense
[1:21:09] <+SpoonlessAlakazam> confused virus hobbY
[1:21:10] <Grennold> Considering Ada leaves witout trace with a plagas sample Leon damn better have put that in his fucking report
[1:21:10] <%mjkenney24> wait there's dinosaurs now

[1:21:13] <%peachy996> "Do not talk ill of my friends Twink and Bottom, Lady"
[1:21:14] <ahbhajit> The C Virus is fantastical nonsense
[1:21:15] <%xUmbraNinja> psaBig psaBig psaBig
[1:21:16] <+NitronStreams> I think Capcom was confused about the C-virus
[1:21:16] <+Sushi2k> like every RE game
[1:21:16] <Bustahhwulf> drinking corona beer give u c virus WutFace
[1:21:16] <RICE02> Corona Virus is confusing indeed

[1:21:22] <%Deft_Thought> C-virus = Chimera!
[1:21:22] <Monkeyweed21> Leon is REALLY shy and embarrased about his Yellow Fever
[1:21:23] <%templar010> these are fucking aliens at this point
[1:21:23] <natebud> Just turns dudes into iguanas
[1:21:23] <Zebroneath> There's barely any commonality
[1:21:24] <Kain5707> it aint no JUP virus
[1:21:24] <%studleydoorite> the virus shows what's truly in your heart

[1:21:25] <R3TURNoftheMACK> @PatStaresAt Would anyone believe a Woman in a revealing dress GAVE Leon a jet ski to escape the island
[1:21:26] <%The_Chris27> C Stands for Creation
[1:21:26] <%Deft_Thought> Which in Japan means random
[1:21:30] <CloniiCory> I remember the T-Rex, but not the Dilophosaurus.
[1:21:30] <thelonechris> C is for cock
[1:21:30] <%Th3SmartAlec> Coccons and zombies and clones
[1:21:30] <biomegabear> Some of them are monster hunter jagras
[1:21:31] <%Aracon_> like how does the C virus just amplify the human body to such a radical degree
[1:21:33] <%The_Chris27> that way they can make what they want
[1:21:37] <%Tearonex> C virus has the power of the Plot
[1:21:37] <DesuDesuDokiDoki> @PatStaresAt remember that lizard from Jurassic park? lol
[1:21:39] <%Th3SmartAlec> WHAT ARE THOSE
[1:21:40] <%heartlesshealer> it's a huge problem, even if the virus did exactly what they wanted as far as goals are concerned
[1:21:41] <%doc_ock_rokc> @PatStaresAt Its not random it injects DNA into humans and forces them to mutate into whatever
[1:21:41] <ScreamLord> @PatStaresAt At this point it's just the Necromorph shit from Dead space
[1:21:42] <MyNameIsRasus> C means life
[1:21:42] <%Aracon_> and make random animal based monsters
[1:21:42] <Pwgregory> Ada has a gun? Where? Why?
[1:21:45] <nuane> Cretaceous Virus
[1:21:46] <%krawtch> cumvirus makes what it wants to
[1:21:47] <Gr4ndm4rsh4ll> Wait, are they spewing zombie gas?
[1:21:48] <%peachy996> These are Monster Hunter enemies
[1:21:49] <manoshake> @patstaresat C-virus is a mumbo jumbo combination of other viruses
[1:21:51] <RyanTheRecluse> I feel the c virus needs a shamwow like infomercial
[1:21:55] <natebud> nah i dont realy care
[1:21:55] <%Nordguy> C is for Consume (product)
[1:21:57] <%Deft_Thought> Who the hell gave that Civilian a gun?
[1:21:57] <%dave323dave> it might as well be magic at this point
[1:21:58] <+Starlight_Gamer> why isnt every one a transformer like simmons?
[1:21:59] <%Zaphire_Saucypants> We all know C means Cum Virus
[1:22:01] <%Th3SmartAlec> "lady, you seem wierdly calm about all this"
[1:22:02] <GarettLefebvre> Pat are you saying that you doing have a big titty monster hiding in you?
[1:22:02] <Monkeyweed21> WHAT DO YOU MEAN DOGS DONT TURN INTO T-REXES AND GIANT FLY MONSTERS
[1:22:03] <Dragon_Batman> I would be worried as to why Ada has a gun if I were them
[1:22:05] <Dutchpotato> Just don’t think about it
[1:22:05] <%Huntercd> Bugs lizards and zombie
[1:22:07] <%Zaphire_Saucypants> And cum = life
[1:22:07] <natebud> Remember how the T virus made all those frogs big?
[1:22:09] <ape_hawk> CUM HAZARD
[1:22:09] <+ArtoriasTheTrenchfighter> Cmon guys, you're all right, cause C stands for CAPCOM
[1:22:10] <jinking79> it weird to Believe that Chris ever had Sex
[1:22:14] <%heartlesshealer> oh boy
[1:22:16] <tyrano_the_wise> a virus that can turn the national security advisor into a T-rex
[1:22:23] <+ItsYaGirlMaria> Why are there Jagras here
[1:22:24] <RICE02> C stands for Corona. People should watch more news NotLikeThis
[1:22:24] <$PhantomMiG> @patstaresat C-Virus does not have a monster theme unlike the other RE viruses
[1:22:25] <%krawtch> C is for cocktail because its like 92 different viruses and its random whichever one wins and decides what monster you are
[1:22:26] <wrydiculous> Get this, these reptile enemies are weak against martial arts
[1:22:30] <GamingPhobic> Finn's codename should just be doorknob
[1:22:31] <%Th3SmartAlec> @jinking79 Even wierder to think Wesker did
[1:22:31] <%doc_ock_rokc> Remember how the T virus made a plant turn into a vampire plant?
[1:22:33] <%MajorCrasher> chris has absolutely never had sex
[1:22:36] <codycurry52> This game is offensively bad
[1:22:36] <CloniiCory> @jinking79 I refuse to believe Chris fucks.
[1:22:37] <%alexandrecau> @Dragon_Batman they are americans they believe everyone should have a gun
[1:22:41] <TafferAA> humans turning into lizards doesnt even begin to make sense
[1:22:43] <DesuDesuDokiDoki> its for CUM
[1:22:43] <%Aracon_> chrisallis
[1:22:44] <%heartlesshealer> chrysalid
[1:22:45] <%mMayrro> C is always for cock
[1:22:46] <+Ell1ot> C is for cookie
[1:22:46] <Sammang> You think the wing of the lab they made the C virus in was called the C Section?
[1:22:47] <%anticrust> CUM
[1:22:48] <KeiPrime> t virus just made a snake a giant snake
[1:22:48] <DuoScratch> I thought C is for CUM
[1:22:49] <+tsatoma> C is for CHRRRIIIISSS
[1:22:49] <+Starlight_Gamer> was this supposed to be a dino crisis game?
[1:22:50] <+Aullama> Being a dinosaur sounds pretty neato danX
[1:22:52] <%krawtch> i could not have more clearly been making shit up
[1:22:53] <%Zaphire_Saucypants> The Cummy Virus.
[1:22:54] <%goose_attack_almanac> Why do they only have one long arm
[1:22:55] <%Valdorick> But that's such a better game than this.
[1:22:56] <%Sir_stride> C IS FOR COOKIE
[1:22:58] <%SaiyanShoto> C is for cum
[1:22:58] <%Bane_Kaikyo> C is for PENIS!!
[1:22:59] <gamezerox> C is for Crystal
[1:23:00] <%heartlesshealer> that fucking walk
[1:23:00] <SuperfluousCoughSyrup> This is one chapter BTW
[1:23:01] <%peachy996> These are just Dinosaurs
[1:23:01] <+ArtoriasTheTrenchfighter> I thought it was Chrysalid like XCOM?
[1:23:03] <oruandrew> cute lil fuckers
[1:23:03] <myriad_truth> To be ffair, a cocoon is supposed to Metamorph what is in it
[1:23:05] <karl_rex> So why dinosaurs?
[1:23:06] <%doc_ock_rokc> @Sir_stride Thats good enough for me
[1:23:07] <%heartlesshealer> it's so goofy with the slappy steps
[1:23:08] <Pwgregory> Fight this crisis of the dinosaurs.
[1:23:09] <%krawtch> thick white P-virus
[1:23:09] <Monkeyweed21> Everyone know that T-Rexes evolve into giant fly monsters
[1:23:10] <R3TURNoftheMACK> C is for crappy campaign
[1:23:11] <%Th3SmartAlec> @doc_ock_rokc That's still a plant. and that was researching different aspects of the T-Virus. The C-Virus appears to just do things at random with any organism
[1:23:12] <Dragon_Batman> @alexandrecau your right. LAnd of the free
[1:23:13] <deltakuma009> did that rat thing just hit you with a shotgun blast?
[1:23:14] <%D3rrtyD4n> good call
[1:23:14] <luckycloud91> C is for stop asking questions
[1:23:15] <CrimsonCore90> C is Complacent
[1:23:15] <tyrano_the_wise> like, when the maggot comes out of the cocoon, its still an insect... not a fucking dinosaur
[1:23:15] <TafferAA> he said no and left LuL
[1:23:16] <%JJCheeker> Yeah you should just keep running
[1:23:17] <%templar010> just dip
[1:23:18] <tiaramaki> Those things' steps sound like a clock for some reason
[1:23:20] <%peachy996> As Chris runs away lol
[1:23:24] <Dragon_Batman> Even in Russia
[1:23:27] <%Bane_Kaikyo> P E N I S
[1:23:27] <thelonechris> HU
[1:23:28] <SlimeBoogey> C is for Corona and capcom unleashed it to get back at us for talking shit about RE6
[1:23:29] <+lethallylactic> HE-
[1:23:29] <%Th3SmartAlec> C is for China
[1:23:29] <Kisiel250> T-virus should be creating T-rexes
[1:23:31] <$PhantomMiG> I mean Revelations virus has the fish thing, G-Virus gets eyes
[1:23:32] <%comfyman12> Thanks for reminding me that Chris' campaign is the biggest turd in the shit sandwich
[1:23:33] <Pwgregory> Who gave Ada a gun?

[1:24:10] <%MajorCrasher> almost all the vbiruses at least have the consistency of turnings all of them same types of organisms into the same kinds of things if the virus is administered in the same way. with C, people seem to turn into whatever. even if they all contract it the same way, everyone turns into something different

[1:24:24] <natebud> no
[1:24:24] <%doc_ock_rokc> @Th3SmartAlec It doesn't what it does is it injects DNA into a human and causes them to mutate. Different strains cause different monsters

[1:25:12] <Nekros4442> Why the fuck didnt Chris shoot Ada there
[1:25:12] <%Valdorick> They also became jobbers
[1:25:13] <VizualBlitz> And once again Chris Laments his weak mortal flesh
[1:25:13] <%heartlesshealer> your beloved men are now generic trolls
[1:25:13] <%cvp5127> thats a terrible grenade
[1:25:13] <%tank7013> Imagine dying and your boss is only concerned about one of your coworkers
[1:25:15] <tyrano_the_wise> Convinience virus
[1:25:16] <nademonkey1100> was ada always this evil
[1:25:16] <%Neryl_> @PatStaresAt Of course they do. They had flames. Flames go faster.
[1:25:17] <biomegabear> shittier versions of the C virus turn them into this?
[1:25:17] <+gambit_gamble> So Ada was evil all along

[1:25:37] <rcand9> big combo
[1:25:38] <Dragon_Batman> And that is why he had Amnesia
[1:25:38] <TafferAA> head smashed into concrete, super dead
[1:25:39] <%heartlesshealer> saving private ryan????
[1:25:39] <%shiplord13> @PatStaresAt No way Piers killed all of them
[1:25:40] <+BizarreRevolver> SHOULDNT THEIR ARMOUR BE THICK ENOUGH TO STOP THE NEEDLES!!!???
[1:25:40] <SGrim> Chris P Weiner is kill PogChamp
[1:25:41] <hamiltin463> Like dead 5 times over
[1:25:41] <%trustycoyote> Why do their clothes merge and get goopy too?
[1:25:41] <natebud> And then we had to go away
[1:25:42] <myriad_truth> Didn't Chris kill Forest?
[1:25:42] <s1rcuit> it's crazy how dead he is
[1:25:43] <Kisiel250> boulders take revenge on Chris
[1:25:43] <Dragon_Batman> For some reason
[1:25:43] <%EuropanLamprey> I HEARD A CRACK
[1:25:44] <%JusTTheGuyYouNeed> psaBig DEAD
[1:25:44] <Pillagius> See, Pat? This situation kinda explains memory problems Chris has
[1:25:45] <katocrimson> After everything Chris went through, I surprised he not crippled bt PTSD
[1:25:46] <+tangoragahn> AMNESIA
[1:25:46] <%Th3SmartAlec> ?????
[1:25:46] <%Ran196> F
[1:25:47] <@SSaryn> Yes.
[1:25:47] <%johnny_gogo> oh man this is real bad what are they gonna do
[1:25:48] <%studleydoorite> no
[1:25:48] <R3TURNoftheMACK> They SURVIVE this
[1:25:49] <SlimeBoogey> honestly no idea how they got out of this situation
[1:25:50] <biomegabear> gold
[1:25:50] <%CopperTucker> this is so dumb. Jesus.
[1:25:50] <+dabootymagnet> this game is weird
[1:25:50] <%mMayrro> Herbs :)
[1:25:50] <PrettyThickandStrongDyck> Remember this is all a flashback
[1:25:50] <%Aracon_> because
[1:25:51] <%Corporate_Redeemer> Chris hit his head pretty hard tho
[1:25:51] <%MisterTylerrr> They didn't?
[1:25:52] <%D3rrtyD4n> 🤷
[1:25:52] <bear_breaker20> lmao this s=is fucking dumb
[1:25:52] <+Starlight_Gamer> ????
[1:25:53] <Hellarussian> hey. Hut up
[1:25:53] <Gr4ndm4rsh4ll> Was that slo-mo head smack implying he lost his memory?...
[1:25:54] <omegadarknes> !uptime
[1:25:54] <%heartlesshealer> because bio miracle
[1:25:54] <@Moobot> I've been playing this game for how long? Oh only 1h 25m.
[1:25:54] <%Th3SmartAlec> Shut up
[1:25:54] <+lethallylactic> shuttup tho
[1:25:55] <rcand9> its a shame chris died
[1:25:55] <%krawtch> that monster just punched alcoholism and misogyny into Chris
[1:25:55] <@commanderclaw> "Morally Grey"
[1:25:55] <%bevyrage> so chris jobs to push pierce as a badass but also remove all guilt on having to kill his own comrades
[1:25:56] <%SirGO0SE> i cant believe chris redfield is fucking dead
[1:25:56] <MyNameIsRasus> THEY SURVIVE????
[1:25:56] <%VashyronM> plot armor
[1:25:56] <Dr_Mooose> reasons
[1:25:57] <%Sir_stride> BECAUSE POLT
[1:25:58] <%JJCheeker> God that was terrible
[1:25:58] <Dragon_Batman> Cuz Peirs did something apparently
[1:25:58] <%LaughingCatt> Because the plot is bad
[1:25:58] <Grennold> Sad music FeelsBadMan
[1:25:59] <%Sausious> Blue Ada isn;t really Ada
[1:26:00] <%Sir_stride> plot
[1:26:00] <%TheMattman1313> Cuz Piers is actually the coolest
[1:26:01] <%Zulrez> if only the game ended here so you could suffer less
[1:26:01] <+Toblo1> Because Plot
[1:26:01] <%AnthroMetal> SHUT THE FUCK UP THATS HOW - Capcom, probably
[1:26:01] <%tank7013> Piers is just THAT much of a badass apparently
[1:26:02] <+Pyroclase> Remember how Jake's campaign ends???
[1:26:02] <%Aracon_> there's no time
[1:26:02] <BlacSoul> no no no...ALL of them got hit in the neck
[1:26:03] <silverira> plot armor
[1:26:03] <%chambatron> Yo only need 3 ribs to be alive
[1:26:03] <codycurry52> Suffer
[1:26:04] <%shiplord13> @PatStaresAt Piers killed all of them I guess
[1:26:04] <Monkeyweed21> WOW CHRIS IS AN ASSHOLE FOR FORGETTING PIERS
[1:26:04] <Hellarussian> BIG ol' shut up about it
[1:26:05] <GamingPhobic> no they die, campaign over, you can stop
[1:26:05] <+Lunarhawk> wait that entire thing was chapter 2? I thought the mansion part was chapter 3 lmao
[1:26:06] <SlimeBoogey> that's the hardest part to believe
[1:26:06] <iwa5h4ck3d> BibleThump YURI
[1:26:06] <+CptDouglasJFalcon> Imagine how badly Ada's plan would have gone if one of the soldiers just voleyball slapped that needle ball back at her
[1:26:07] <jinking79> Chris punches boulder that won't kill him that easily
[1:26:08] <natebud> aw man piers is so good at his job
[1:26:08] <+SpoonlessAlakazam> none of this made any sense
[1:26:09] <Pwgregory> How did Chris not at least get permanent brain damage?
[1:26:10] <%NekoUrabe> Because Chris is a hero
[1:26:12] <%Deft_Thought> Why are you still talking and not SALUTING YOUR FALLEN BROTHERS
[1:26:12] <rytisone> and Piers just draged him out with monsters on his ass
[1:26:13] <%SirGO0SE> you mean that ass?
[1:26:14] <tyrano_the_wise> HOW DOES CHRIS END UP AT THE BAR?
[1:26:14] <%krawtch> they got away no problem
[1:26:15] <%Sir_stride> yup
[1:26:16] <Dragon_Batman> It should have hit chris and piers
[1:26:16] <KeiPrime> Pat's Favorite
[1:26:16] <DrkJP520> Lucky none of those hit her
[1:26:16] <%FunkyRib> Wheey!
[1:26:17] <Hellarussian> yeah?
[1:26:18] <%Meekest> There was no time
[1:26:18] <thelonechris> Why did none of those hit Chris?
[1:26:20] <RICE02> Finn was a as useless as in Star Wars
[1:26:20] <Dutchpotato> Piers is a big offscreen hero
[1:26:20] <Pillagius> The cut out was because Capcom didn't give a fuck, or couldn't figure what and how to do it
[1:26:21] <nademonkey1100> SHUT UP
[1:26:23] <+Starlight_Gamer> dont want to think about it
[1:26:24] <+Zereaux> @PatStaresAt SHES ON AN INTERNATIONAL WANTED LIST AT THIS POINT IN THE TIMELINE ISNT SHE
[1:26:24] <%johnny_gogo> mass produce thos shtis
[1:26:25] <%alexandrecau> syringes filled with cum

[1:26:31] <tigerfang86> Yes
[1:26:31] <+dante_must_die_exe> NO SHUDDUP
[1:26:32] <%Valdorick> Yes
[1:26:32] <%Sir_stride> yea absolutely
[1:26:33] <%krawtch> she wasted it on like FOUR DUDES
[1:26:33] <@SSaryn> Good point actually
[1:26:34] <myriad_truth> It would be a pain to make
[1:26:34] <%LaughingCatt> WHY ARE WE IN CHINA NOW
[1:26:35] <%Th3SmartAlec> @Zereaux appsarently not!
[1:26:35] <%MajorCrasher> NO TIME PAT
[1:26:35] <%NekoUrabe> Yeah we only see it like the one time
[1:26:36] <%morcego_cinzento_arts> It was already BS how rapid Birking would Transform in RE2. Ever since it's like rat sized animals turning into mamoth sized monster in 2 secs
[1:26:36] <%tank7013> The most efficient grenade of all time? Kappa
[1:26:37] <dickbuttwoman> So like, Does Ada get it at the end of this?
[1:26:37] <natebud> You'd think a gas grenade would work
[1:26:37] <VirtuaRailith> wouldn't some of those needles hit chris and/or ada
[1:26:39] <trulythedude> why is ada evil
[1:26:39] <SeventyForce> Nah, it's just the tip. It's fine.
[1:26:41] <tigerfang86> Yes and she used it to kill like 5 people
[1:26:41] <LillethBlue> Especially when they already have those fart bombs
[1:26:41] <CrypticMochi> I mean Chris can stand in a volcano so...
[1:26:41] <C24U> Worth it
[1:26:42] <%templar010> Punished Chris
[1:26:43] <%Emperor_Machinus> The anti Pat grenade
[1:26:43] <%heartlesshealer> especially for the glass on the syringes to not shatter instantly
[1:26:44] <Dr_Mooose> money problems in RE, not a thing
[1:26:44] <+thackattack00> Bro she had glasses that blew up in 4
[1:26:45] <%Ran196> can't make money if you don't spend money
[1:26:46] <+Starlight_Gamer> neo umbrella pat
[1:26:46] <Xenodile> The most expensive and least efficient way to spread the virus
[1:26:47] <Dragon_Batman> RE villains never cared about how much they throw money away
[1:26:48] <TafferAA> A POS LuL
[1:26:49] <+prime_name> Remkember?
[1:26:50] <jinking79> and it didn't hit Chris and Peirs
[1:26:50] <%goose_attack_almanac> remember what??
[1:26:50] <$floralkami> @natebud YOU WOULD THINK
[1:26:51] <%Sir_stride> BOWs are very lucrative
[1:26:51] <Xenodile> also HOW THE HELL DID THEY GET OUT
[1:26:52] <%Dr_DangerPhD> Sometimes you gotta treat yo self to the better things in biohazard terrorist life
[1:26:54] <natebud> OR THE GAS MISSIILES
[1:26:54] <%Th3SmartAlec> WHAT HE ACTUALLY HAD MEMORY LOSS
[1:26:57] <%derekwst3> so what chapter is this?
[1:26:58] <myriad_truth> Wesker punches hit harder than that
[1:26:59] <+NitronStreams> Couldnt she have just used a SMOKE grenade
[1:27:00] <Pillagius> Well, 10k+ for insta 10+ super mutants, Pat? Seems fairly prised
[1:27:01] <Jetsfantasy> Depends on if insurance coveres syringe grenades
[1:27:01] <daisyyyy> Dude we shoot $100,000 missiles off all the time
[1:27:01] <%krawtch> money is like mass, its not real and dont think about it
[1:27:02] <+SpoonlessAlakazam> UMP-9 PogChamp
[1:27:02] <%heartlesshealer> but nah
[1:27:06] <%Aracon_> oh NOW he wants to kill her
[1:27:07] <%Huntercd> Chris survive Wesker how did Jobber bow win? @PatStaresAt
[1:27:07] <silverira> NO TIME
[1:27:07] <%Meekest> Wait he actually lost his memory
[1:27:08] <fatalDestiny> Yeah but Drama
[1:27:08] <digsby> You'd think anti biohazard people would have flamers more regularly in this series.
[1:27:08] <+Zereaux> THIS IS ALL LEONS FAULT
[1:27:09] <+Starlight_Gamer> not as cool
[1:27:09] <+JackMillerTime> its the military so i expect it
[1:27:09] <Monkeyweed21> WHY NOT A GAS GRENADE
[1:27:10] <DesuDesuDokiDoki> <3
[1:27:11] <%JJCheeker> You know what if I was Chris I would've killed her
[1:27:11] <%goose_attack_almanac> yeah but viruses
[1:27:11] <%Valdorick> Install it into a TMP and burst fire them?
[1:27:11] <%tank7013> @Th3SmartAlec Look he got REALLY drunk that one time
[1:27:11] <AnacondaVirtue> Now you're just nitpicking
[1:27:12] <drinkmoxie> Pat they aren’t fast the C-Virus zombies are proximity based any crystalis is immediately set of my Chris’ Machismo
[1:27:12] <%DukeMoose> when you have the money, USE IT
[1:27:12] <%chambatron> Wel yeah but War crimes
[1:27:13] <TafferAA> why not gas
[1:27:13] <%dave323dave> but a zombie grenade tho\
[1:27:15] <Pwgregory> ...amnesia...my favourite tripe! I mean trope!
[1:27:16] <Higaraishi> wait was that all just a fgucking flashback
[1:27:18] <%Admiral_PopnFresh> Ok, so China occurred after Eastern Europe?
[1:27:19] <babypie1988> What they don't show is that Dante came to save the day.
[1:27:19] <%heartlesshealer> real grenades are for decoys
[1:27:20] <Hellarussian> yeah but consider this: shut up about the logistics
[1:27:20] <%Zaphire_Saucypants> she wanted to give Chris the PTSD
[1:27:20] <oruandrew> zombie grenade hahaha
[1:27:20] <%Valdorick> Litterally anything but "A bomb"
[1:27:21] <RICE02> what is even Pats point
[1:27:22] <%DappercatEsquire> it's just a fancy nail bomb, probably some kind of compressed air and poisoned needles
[1:27:24] <%doc_ock_rokc> So Chris REPRESSED the memories?
[1:27:25] <%mMayrro> no :)
[1:27:25] <Hellarussian> no lets not
[1:27:26] <%Modren83> It could've been filled with C-Virus gas
[1:27:26] <%heartlesshealer> I DON'T WANT TO
[1:27:27] <trianglehat> no don't think
[1:27:28] <%MajorCrasher> but if she didn't use the syringe nade, how else was she going to give chris ptsd
[1:27:28] <Dragon_Batman> Video games
[1:27:28] <%MisterTylerrr> YOU GOT GUNS YOU DIDN'T HAVE
[1:27:28] <%SirGO0SE> NO TIME
[1:27:28] <%Erimos> Someone could/would have jumped on a frag grenade.
[1:27:28] <jjetfuel> but she wanted to kill them in a cool way
[1:27:29] <%MrBorisMakarov> NO
[1:27:29] <%Dead_trickster> time travelling weapons and grenades
[1:27:29] <Monkeyweed21> CHRIS REMEMBERED HE HAS A SHOTGUN
[1:27:29] <PrettyThickandStrongDyck> Pat thats just a bad nitpick
[1:27:30] <%Th3SmartAlec> How has Leon never heard of Ada doing that
[1:27:30] <tigerfang86> NO TIME
[1:27:31] <+lethallylactic> no :)
[1:27:31] <natebud> Chris imagined a shotgun
[1:27:31] <Pillagius> lol

[1:27:44] <Dutchpotato> No don’t think
[1:27:44] <DrkJP520> Don't think, feel
[1:27:45] <+CptDouglasJFalcon> He repressed the shotgun
[1:27:45] <PrettyThickandStrongDyck> He remembered he had it shut up
[1:27:45] <%mMayrro> CHRIS FORGOT HE HAD THEM LUL
[1:27:45] <C24U> BIO CURS
[1:27:46] <+Pyroclase> Kowloon is an amazing setting for a survival horror game and they totally waste it in this game. It ticks me off.
[1:27:46] <DesuDesuDokiDoki> NO TINE
[1:27:47] <%Fenrirlives> HEAD EMPTY
[1:27:47] <%Admiral_PopnFresh> TIME POWERS
[1:27:48] <tigerfang86> HE REMEMBERED IT PAT
[1:27:49] <bromeme> Why does she give her real name?
[1:27:50] <Sammang> He reenacted it in real time
[1:27:50] <%Aracon_> OF COURSE
[1:27:50] <Dragon_Batman> It's a dumb video game, not really worth nitpicking
[1:27:50] <+NitronStreams> ANTI TIME
[1:27:50] <PrettyThickandStrongDyck> No just shut up

[1:27:53] <+SpoonlessAlakazam> I've been thinking about it and I want to avoid doing that in the future
[1:27:54] <%templar010> you pulled it from your MIND
[1:27:54] <%SuperSonichu> @PatStaresAt would u consider doing a stream of the first deus ex? That'd be p fucking baller tbh
[1:27:54] <oruandrew> wtf
[1:27:54] <CloniiCory> Chris is a time lord confirmed.
[1:27:54] <%krawtch> he equipped the shotgun from within himself
[1:27:54] <%Deft_Thought> Chris is a Stand User

[1:27:57] <AnacondaVirtue> He could've picked one up in between cutscenes
[1:27:57] <$frankthetank285> the fact Chris dosen't just kill he when Leon stops him blows my mind just kill her
[1:27:57] <%The_Chris27> You just remembered that you have the shotgun that's all

[1:28:06] <+Starlight_Gamer> time is convoluted

[1:30:20] <%optimasmaximas> MORIOH PogChamp
[1:30:21] <+jiggy_snipe> see Chris isn't all business Kappa
[1:30:21] <Dragon_Batman> Ever since 4 they have to do some dumb thing
[1:30:24] <PkSilent01> Did i miss the Playground Part
[1:30:24] <gamezerox> Chris to HQ watch me slide down that slide
[1:30:24] <%EuropanLamprey> Chris has to take his mind of seeing is team get melted right in front of his eyes like ten minutes ago
[1:30:24] <%MisterTylerrr> YOU DIDN'T NEED HIM
[1:30:25] <CloniiCory> @Dementedpenguin So they could have a suggestive thing for the Schoolgirl Sherry model to straddle in the model viewer.
[1:30:26] <karl_rex> So is this virus just Diego Brando's power?
[1:30:28] <GamingPhobic> wait is that map just wrong?
[1:30:30] <%DukeMoose> "Rescue"
[1:30:33] <+KingGoblodyte> @wrydiculous YOU KNOW WHY
[1:30:33] <natebud> wat
[1:30:34] <%YakumoYomi> What a beautiful duwang
[1:30:35] <%NekoUrabe> SH2 Reference! PogChamp
[1:30:37] <+Pyr0_Fr0st> It's a miracle that RE7 came out at good as it did
[1:30:38] <%Th3SmartAlec> Man I didn't realize the park was after the PTSD all my friends are dead cutscene
[1:30:40] <TafferAA> you are here- Wuhan
[1:30:42] <%derekwst3> someones having their period
[1:30:42] <Grennold> Is this the local seafood market? Kppa
[1:30:42] <thelonechris> Look at all that China
[1:30:42] <%Dementedpenguin> @CloniiCory The more you know.
[1:30:43] <%Ixiah> time for massive battle
[1:30:44] <+Neoepochx> @karl_rex LUL
[1:30:45] <%johnny_gogo> I wish this game had taunts
[1:30:47] <$Daisuke89> Is chris wearing the BSAA outfit from 5??
[1:30:50] <trulythedude> is pat streaming today?
[1:30:50] <DatAsuna> @PatStaresAt Also, i watched that Raycevik vid and it looks like he played it in co-op with suzi
[1:30:52] <+Pyroclase> This game wasted an amazing Kowloon setting.
[1:30:52] <Hellarussian> you mean the least actiony part?
[1:30:55] <ricky12k> Alright back from getting wild wings. What chapter are we in?
[1:30:57] <MayorRev> I spoiled myself on Ada's ending and I'm losing my mind
[1:30:59] <%krawtch> all my friends are DEAD... wheeeee horsey
[1:31:00] <%optimasmaximas> this game is extreme wasted potential
[1:31:03] <%Aracon_> squandered
[1:31:05] <mrcelab> CORONA
[1:31:05] <Jetsfantasy> Yeah, a mass outbreak with a virus starting in C... not the best time to play this LUL
[1:31:06] <%EuropanLamprey> The perfect setting for a mass outbreak, China
[1:31:06] <tigerfang86> eeeeeeh
[1:31:08] <tigerfang86> eeeeeeeeeeeeh
[1:31:09] <%Th3SmartAlec> Maybe because they calmed their tits for a second to let the atmosphere set in
[1:31:10] <%templar010> wasted in this pile of shit
[1:31:10] <biomegabear> SWORDS?
[1:31:11] <%SaiyanShoto> It has potential
[1:31:12] <%Nemesis2098> God i cant wait for RE3make to blow this outta the water
[1:31:12] <%heartlesshealer> masks
[1:31:14] <%Zaphire_Saucypants> @ricky12k Chapter 3 I think
[1:31:15] <%LaughingCatt> Couldn't have fallen flatter if it actually tried to
[1:31:16] <%Th3SmartAlec> Annnnnd there it goes
[1:31:16] <nademonkey1100> it would be nice if the redid this like remake2
[1:31:18] <natebud> battle this position
[1:31:18] <Nightwing_B01> FeelsBadMan
[1:31:21] <+Neoepochx> Man, that fight was SO TENSE.
[1:31:22] <TafferAA> battle position-punch the shit out of them
[1:31:24] <tigerfang86> aaaaaaand the good part's gone
[1:31:24] <Pwgregory> Do you Chris has a template letter for the families of each person on his team ready to go at all times: “We regret to inform you...”
[1:31:25] <biomegabear> THOSE GUYS HAD SWORD?
[1:31:26] <GamingPhobic> that dude just aggressively slav squatted LUL
[1:31:26] <ricky12k> @zaphire_saucypants Thanks.
[1:31:28] <%D00msDayDan> battle positions? what is this, the navy?
[1:31:29] <%EuropanLamprey> That motherfucker had a fucking Scimitar?
[1:31:33] <Dragon_Batman> There were some ok ideas here and there, it's a shame that this game is just awful
[1:31:35] <%Quikanims> THE C VIRUS MADE THE SPOOKY CHINA MEN WEAR MASKS
[1:31:35] <%Erimos> At least the game isn't a cakewalk.
[1:31:36] <+Lunarhawk> Use the ammo drop upgrades coward
[1:31:42] <Monkeyweed21> To be fair theres a lot of ammo you're not picking up
[1:31:43] <+tsatoma> Gotta get the extra drops skill
[1:31:44] <%Th3SmartAlec> @nademonkey1100 Man, video games are the opposite of movies when it comes to remakes aren't they?
[1:31:47] <DrkJP520> I don't remember ammo being this scarce.
[1:31:49] <%heartlesshealer> ????
[1:31:49] <thelonechris> I thought he was about to elbow drop on one of them
[1:31:50] <$PhantomMiG> @patstaresat Watch that RE3 remake does a better dense city and mass out break then this game
[1:31:51] <ricky12k> @lunarhawk You know he wont.
[1:31:52] <%Meekest> Turn on infinite ammo
[1:31:52] <%Erimos> Dull+easy is worse than dull+challenge.
[1:31:52] <+prime_name> WHAT'S WITH THESE ARMS
[1:31:54] <%heartlesshealer> Pistol Shrimp arms?
[1:31:54] <Xenodile> Shouldn't Chris's punches just disintegrate people, zombies or no, since he's got that crazy boulder punch strength?
[1:31:55] <CloniiCory> Ammo and Health are so stingy in this game it runs counter intuitive to the game design.
[1:31:55] <CrimsonCore90> But Survival Horror
[1:31:56] <Dragon_Batman> They also need to not have the score drops
[1:31:58] <codycurry52> YEAH suRVIvor hOrRor
[1:32:00] <Djinnazz> they look really stupid
[1:32:01] <Eismachine94> Naa just punch everything
[1:32:03] <biomegabear> YOU ALWAYS HAD TO MANAGE YOUR AMMO IN RE GAMES
[1:32:06] <Hellarussian> this game is about family
[1:32:08] <%Deft_Thought> I sincerely think this game would have been okay if they'd focused on one campaign
[1:32:08] <+Neoepochx> If we had ammo then it isn't survival horror Kappa
[1:32:09] <%studleydoorite> gotta use the melees dog
[1:32:10] <GamingPhobic> I think they planned on people using the melee system more
[1:32:11] <Pillagius> Pat have you tried hitting enemies instead of walls?
[1:32:12] <%NekoUrabe> @PatStaresAt Dont you think Chris with a machete would be fun considering how big strong he is?
[1:32:13] <%JJCheeker> They should have kept everything like it was in 5
[1:32:14] <%Th3SmartAlec> They should just drop ammo all over, conserving it doesn't make sense in this game
[1:32:14] <%D3rrtyD4n> i remember having ammo issues, because its set up to be this action game and you want to shoot bang everything
[1:32:16] <nademonkey1100> @Th3SmartAlec it really is and that is weird ow that you say it
[1:32:16] <%TheNewJapanGuy> Fuck it just use infinite ammo
[1:32:16] <%Sausious> pat complains about ammo but refuses to shoot weak points, wasting more ammo
[1:32:16] <%sonicspark007> survival horror means huge action but little ammo
[1:32:16] <rumblebunni> Why doesn't your squad lend you a clip?
[1:32:17] <%thegreatbambe> Man those are some horrible looking monsters
[1:32:18] <biomegabear> YOU'RE RIGHT
[1:32:19] <ricky12k> Pat maybe it be best you quit reloading constantly when you already got a some bullets in the clip.
[1:32:20] <$OmegaWeltall> yea it tried to be actiony and it tried to be resident evil, and it did neitehr well
[1:32:23] <fillmydarksoulwithlight> I just remembered the fucking heli that you have no ammo for and will take a literal hour to kill.
[1:32:23] <%johnny_gogo> But pat hit him with your boulder punchin hand
[1:32:23] <C24U> RE3 begs to differ
[1:32:24] <%SirGO0SE> this is an RE game in title and characters only
[1:32:26] <wrydiculous> @patstaresat I'm amazed you haven't been slide kicking like a motherfucker throughout this playthrough, would've saved you shit tons of ammo against grunts
[1:32:26] <%Aracon_> and all these enemies are bullet sponges
[1:32:26] <%anticrust> They decided to make it an action game, but gave you survival game ammo
[1:32:28] <+tsatoma> Specifically, ones you can't run away from
[1:32:30] <gunzerkingdunce> They want you to melee. like da anime movies
[1:32:32] <DesuDesuDokiDoki> RE games were plentiful with ammo
[1:32:32] <%MajorCrasher> managing ammo is fine in survival horror, but when it becomes an action game, running out shouldn't be an issue
[1:32:32] <%D3rrtyD4n> this is not a typical RE game
[1:32:32] <%heartlesshealer> Pistol shrimps main attribute is that their punches are supposed to be so fast that they can stun or kill!
[1:32:32] <$floralkami> @sausious what fucking weak points?
[1:32:33] <+Neoepochx> In this case it is enemies you HAVE to kill.
[1:32:37] <Dragon_Batman> It's like Megaman 1 with the score drops instead of ammo and health
[1:32:39] <%Huntercd> Use infininte ammo @PatStaresAt
[1:32:40] <%SaiyanShoto> God forbid this action centric game gives you ammo
[1:32:41] <%Aracon_> none of them go down with a single bullet or even 2
[1:32:41] <+dabootymagnet> you think they wish this game never happened
[1:32:41] <%KeystoneA1> BUGS
[1:32:43] <TafferAA> that looks like the guy from swamp thing
[1:32:48] <%Ixiah> covershooting, the highht of RE games Kappa
[1:32:49] <%Th3SmartAlec> @nademonkey1100 With games it's more easy to fix issues with design and things like that.
[1:32:50] <biomegabear> WAIT FOR THE REMAKE OF 6
[1:32:50] <%heartlesshealer> those mutant punches were hella slow
[1:32:51] <+Starlight_Gamer> where are the dinos?
[1:32:51] <a_mad_dragon> Just kill everything with one bullet 4Head
[1:32:53] <%Deft_Thought> I don't remember that enemy at all
[1:32:53] <%shiplord13> Its third person shooter with survival horror item amounts
[1:32:53] <%honeyman18> this is kind of just a third person shooter with low ammo isnt it?
[1:32:55] <Monkeyweed21> the same reason Sherry was
[1:32:57] <s1rcuit> those are straight up Dead Space enemies
[1:32:59] <%stevesekai> All they had to do was make sure skillpionts don't drop from crates and only ammo and herbs do
[1:32:59] <+Eddy21forsaken> they want you to use melee and counters
[1:33:00] <Jetsfantasy> So that I never have to look at that nightmare fuel again
[1:33:02] <%Th3SmartAlec> Oh hey, a cool looking- And its gone
[1:33:03] <+lethallylactic> This game honestly has so many neat monster designs, it's sad FeelsBadMan
[1:33:05] <Blank9> dude this game is awesome look at those
[1:33:06] <+Neoepochx> Just shoot them in the knees and then suplex them 4Head
[1:33:10] <Hellarussian> so Gears of War
[1:33:10] <DesuDesuDokiDoki> monster designer put in work
[1:33:11] <%heartlesshealer> Good design team, hack writers
[1:33:12] <ricky12k> Because capcom wants action
[1:33:12] <+Pyroclase> gotta love those transformation I-frames
[1:33:13] <$PhantomMiG> @patstaresat Do you think RE3 remake will do this setting but better
[1:33:13] <+White_n0ize> chris and Leon are bad with the ammo, meanwhile Jake has to throw away ammo he gets so much
[1:33:13] <%Zaphire_Saucypants> if they remake 6, it better be a complete full clean slate. New story, new everything.
[1:33:13] <%wruce_> yeah, that's what survival horror is
[1:33:14] <+Pookiedaexzile> Theeeeeeeeft
[1:33:14] <$Kenzo2000> !uptime
[1:33:14] <+lord_ludence> @PatStaresAt Is Revelations worth buying on sale?
[1:33:15] <@Moobot> I've been playing this game for how long? Oh only 1h 33m.
[1:33:17] <%Bane_Kaikyo> You have a KNIFE tho
[1:33:21] <%Th3SmartAlec> Does this game have suplexes?
[1:33:21] <CloniiCory> Very DYE Fantasy lookin monsters I agree. Anyone remember that video?
[1:33:26] <TafferAA> keeps mutating
[1:33:26] <DesuDesuDokiDoki> CUM
[1:33:27] <thelonechris> Cum
[1:33:28] <ricky12k> And to appeal to the west
[1:33:29] <%Th3SmartAlec> SPERM
[1:33:31] <%Aracon_> what was all that semen
[1:33:33] <C24U> ITS BIRKIN
[1:33:35] <Blank9> sliding into enemies and shooting instantly stuns them for big melee
[1:33:36] <natebud> @Th3SmartAlec jake
[1:33:39] <+Neoepochx> A way worse Dead Space....which is some sort of bizarre symmetry
[1:33:40] <+lethallylactic> This is kind of what Dead Space was originally shooting for, isn't it?
[1:33:43] <ahbhajit> CUM VIRUS STRIKES AGAIN
[1:33:44] <+Pyroclase> There's some much good shit in this game that just gets wasted
[1:33:44] <DesuDesuDokiDoki> OH LAWD HE CUMMIN
[1:33:44] <%Zaphire_Saucypants> he spray his seed at Chris cuz he know he doesn't like it.
[1:33:46] <%Th3SmartAlec> @natebud Well at least we have that
[1:33:49] <Hellarussian> zombie spunk
[1:33:50] <+Zereaux> @PatStaresAt WHY DO THEY DISSOLVE LIKE VAMPIRES FROM BLADE?
[1:33:53] <Blank9> and then you can slide under them and do neck snaps it's awesome
[1:33:55] <wrydiculous> pat start spamming slide kicks
[1:33:59] <omegadarknes> psaBougie gymBonk woolieSHOOK
[1:33:59] <rytisone> you left first aid spray
[1:34:00] <Pwgregory> There’s more an adequate amount of ammo in Resident Evil 7
[1:34:01] <ricky12k> If only father of megaman didn’t make capcom appeal to the west we would got good games.
[1:34:03] <Dragon_Batman> It's what Dead Space 3 became really
[1:34:04] <%Deft_Thought> They're like Nergigante
[1:34:08] <karl_rex> Why does the RE world have ammo everywhere?
[1:34:08] <Pillagius> oh god... this crap!?
[1:34:09] <shotgang86> psaWhat
[1:34:12] <%heartlesshealer> I think what makes this so incredibly bad is that it was an "almost good"
[1:34:14] <%doc_ock_rokc> @Zereaux the virus increases tempature when the body experiences drama
[1:34:15] <%Th3SmartAlec> WHAT
[1:34:16] <hamiltin463> Fuck this part
[1:34:16] <%D3rrtyD4n> they want you to conserve ammo and melee costs stamina. weird choices in a big action game
[1:34:19] <seniortrump> e d o n i a

[1:34:27] <%Ran196> Why isn't Chris or Piers wearing helmets?
[1:34:29] <+Pookiedaexzile> At least Deadspace had aesthetic
[1:34:32] <+SpoonlessAlakazam> Is that a fucking Comanche? LUL
[1:34:32] <%Aracon_> ??????
[1:34:32] <CrypticMochi> I feel like I’m looking at some boring CoD Gear hybrid
[1:34:32] <jorniev> HOLY SHIT HOW LONG HAVE THEY BEEN RUNING AROUND
[1:34:33] <oruandrew> um?
[1:34:33] <%Th3SmartAlec> @Ran196 shhhhhh

[1:34:44] <%Th3SmartAlec> Piers how do you know that
[1:34:44] <Dragon_Batman> He did have amnesia so I'm shure that was an excuse as well
[1:34:44] <DesuDesuDokiDoki> nani
[1:34:45] <wrydiculous> OH BOY FUCK THAT HELICOPTER
[1:34:46] <natebud> Easy to get lost in rural europe, no one knows where it is

[1:34:48] <%cervidaequus> I now see why the REV2 LP was so hype. Fuck this bullshit game man

[1:34:48] <%Rafferty3231> ... neo-umbrella?
[1:34:50] <King_thunder365> Is that a luchador in that helicopter?
[1:34:50] <%Quigsies> Spec Ops the Resident Evil
[1:34:50] <%Corporate_Redeemer> SHOOT DOG
[1:34:51] <%Dead_trickster> Neo-Umbrella, seriously?
[1:34:53] <%Rafferty3231> wtf
[1:34:53] <CloniiCory> Dead Space is also a great goddamn game. That's the biggest difference.
[1:34:54] <oruandrew> 6 months is 2/3 of a baby
[1:34:54] <Xenodile> QUICKLY CHRIS, PUNCH THE HELICOPTER
[1:34:54] <thelonechris> The 2nd scariest RE monster, an attack chopper
[1:34:55] <Pillagius> We don't know that!? We just seen an half hour long flashback involving those two!!
[1:34:55] <PrettyThickandStrongDyck> This game has the most disgusting enemies in the whole franchise
[1:34:56] <SeventyForce> A Hind-D!?

[1:35:02] <+Zereaux> XCOM; RESIDENT EVIL
[1:35:02] <Pwgregory> Chris has amnesia. He has to tell him. Plus he was drinking himself to death in a bar since then.
[1:35:09] <C24U> RUN INFRONT OF ACTIVE GUNFIRE
[1:35:09] <%Corporate_Redeemer> INFESTED HELICOPTER
[1:35:09] <Neo_Kaiser> This helicopter can be punched to death by Jake
[1:35:10] <%Th3SmartAlec> ....let's think about this. Chris' unit actually has like zero idea what is actually happening
[1:35:11] <coracor> jo avo
[1:35:12] <$floralkami> WHY WOULD THEY THINK THE INFECTED CHOPPER WAS A GOOD IDEA TWIIIIIIIIICE????
[1:35:14] <DesuDesuDokiDoki> aaaAAAAAaaaahhh <3 <3 <3
[1:35:15] <$HyperionXV> Gee, if only chris had kept on of the rocket launchers the jaavo had
[1:35:15] <%tank7013> Is that supposed to be an off brand Cole and Baird?
[1:35:15] <%Deft_Thought> "We need to protect those two! Also; I'm a black man! Listen to my black voice!" -Soldier Man
[1:35:17] <codycurry52> There's no context for any of this.
[1:35:21] <%johnny_gogo> Chris punch that helicopter!
[1:35:22] <TafferAA> call sherry shes dying BibleThump
[1:35:23] <%Admiral_PopnFresh> even small arms can take down armored helos like the Mi-24

[1:35:42] <Xenodile> You can't fucking IGNORE an armored attack helicopter Chris, it's not a problem that goes away if you ignore it!!
[1:35:43] <%morcego_cinzento_arts> at some point, a dev for this gamehad the idea "How about an literal tank boss and a chopper boss? this is why people play Resident Evil, right?"
[1:35:44] <Neo_Kaiser> Has Pat shot an Emblem yet?
[1:35:45] <Dragon_Batman> Your roof tops

[1:35:48] <wrydiculous> just shoot the javo
[1:35:49] <%Th3SmartAlec> @codycurry52 Remember when the president got infected but Leon and Helena were fine? ....what do you mean the game skipped that?
[1:35:49] <C24U> Fuck em

[1:35:52] <jorniev> SCREAM AT THEM

[1:37:27] <CloniiCory> I forget, doesn't Jake have like super kung fu moves that don't work correctly? I feel like that is a mechanic.
[1:37:28] <+CptDouglasJFalcon> To be fair Pat, would you rather be doing this or working retail again?
[1:37:31] <Neo_Kaiser> I can't wait for the co-op playthrough of F3AR with Paige.
[1:37:31] <Dragon_Batman> Sherry's campaign too, I believe

[1:37:49] <%shiplord13> @PatStaresAt Lets be clear all this shit that Chris is going through right now is happening before Leon even gets to China. What is the Chinese government doing during this.
[1:37:50] <%heartlesshealer> what

[1:37:51] <wrydiculous> yes
[1:37:52] <%SirGO0SE> LUL

[1:38:00] <Hellarussian> oh this is bad
[1:38:01] <%SirGO0SE> the lights is out
[1:38:01] <+Kataiser> The heli chapters are the actual worst part of the game now that there's no cross-co-op to get 4 people firing at it.
[1:38:01] <jijipose> I honestly don't get the brightness complaints, it always looked fine to me
[1:38:04] <%CommanderSqueaks> Pierce, pierce bro, pierce move.
[1:38:08] <C24U> Gun vs. Sword
[1:38:08] <Djinnazz> ehat was his plan??

[1:38:11] <%krawtch> CRICKET BOI
[1:38:13] <ahbhajit> this sucks so much
[1:38:13] <+Zereaux> WHAT DID HE THINK HE WAS GONNA DO?
[1:38:14] <%optimasmaximas> @CrimsonCore90 you can see glimmers of potential in this game; DMC2 had none
[1:38:14] <%SeventyForce> Oh thanks bud, much appreciated
[1:38:19] <%honeyman18> psaBig_SQ psaSleep
[1:38:20] <tigerfang86> IS THAT AN OSTRICH MAN

[1:38:20] <thelonechris> At least theres variety to a retail job, like one day you're managing the register, the other you're cleaning toilets Kappa
[1:38:21] <Neo_Kaiser> Jake can instant kill the chopper with a QTE
[1:38:23] <Dragon_Batman> Nah this game is weirdly super dark
[1:38:23] <tigerfang86> WAS THAT AN OSTRICH MAN
[1:38:24] <%NovaKnightmare> Whats even fucking happening in this game
[1:38:25] <+Zereaux> TWIRLING HIS MACHETE LIKE A CHODE
[1:38:25] <+NitronStreams> Resident Evil is Capcom's Premeire Survival Horror Franchise.
[1:38:27] <+Neoepochx> "The light is broken inside, but I still work"
[1:38:28] <%Zaphire_Saucypants> "check out my sick knife moves, bro--no wait, DON'T SHOOT!"
[1:38:28] <%Th3SmartAlec> ????
[1:38:29] <Kisiel250> wtf, was that a chicken
[1:38:30] <fetrigon> UUAAAGH
[1:38:32] <%DatGuyJimbo> @patstaresat just imagine how much better re3make will be after playing this dumpsterfire
[1:38:32] <Hellarussian> what a hero
[1:38:33] <%Th3SmartAlec> Was that glass
[1:38:33] <Dragon_Batman> Even with turning the brightness up
[1:38:34] <%krawtch> DMC2 at least introduced new ideas that would be better used later
[1:38:38] <%EuropanLamprey> Was that the Mantis Men Cave Johnson made?
[1:38:39] <jijipose> This game has the worst level design
[1:38:39] <wrydiculous> not yet
[1:38:40] <LillethBlue> Just looking out of the helicopter like a dog out of a car window
[1:38:41] <C24U> USE BEAR COMMANDER

[1:38:51] <%Th3SmartAlec> Dead
[1:38:51] <+Jpshum> LUL
[1:38:57] <s1rcuit> I'd shoot the ordinance or the rear rotor

[1:39:00] <+Neoepochx> CHOPPER DEFEATED>
[1:39:00] <Dragon_Batman> JAke can now use bar
[1:39:04] <%AxelCezar> everyone is quite resilient against explosions eh
[1:39:09] <Xenodile> Why is the helicopter just leaving??
[1:39:16] <SLVRBAKSLPZ> lol who signs up to be a fucked up bio-terrorist henchmen?
[1:39:17] <CrimsonCore90> @optimasmaximas But DMC2 was creating a niche. This said F your survival horror. You like RE cause of explosions!
[1:39:17] <%NekoUrabe> why dont you just equip infinite ammo
[1:39:25] <thelonechris> No shit
[1:39:27] <%EuropanLamprey> Do we have a "The Main character should be fucking dead" counter?
[1:39:28] <+Pyroclase> for these reasons the game plays a bit better on a higher difficulty I think
[1:39:29] <%heartlesshealer> so every trigger press is wasted ammo, got it
[1:39:30] <Hellarussian> this is good writing
[1:39:30] <+Zereaux> ALSO THIS IS A FULLY EQUIPPED MILITARY OUTFIT HOW DO THEY NOT HAVE ENOUGH AMMO
[1:39:30] <%shiplord13> @PatStaresAt How is all this shit happening in China with no apparent involvement from said government.
[1:39:31] <%Th3SmartAlec> THEY LOOK HUMAN
[1:39:32] <+Pookiedaexzile> Gears of Gore...but not good
[1:39:32] <Neo_Kaiser> Infinite ammo skill is only unlocked after beating the game.
[1:39:38] <Pillagius> on PC shooting doesn't feel too bad tho
[1:39:40] <wrydiculous> The helicopter fight will make you wish you were working retail
[1:39:41] <snekUrgentPls> people die when theyre killed
[1:39:41] <s1rcuit> they work for Grasshopper Manufacture
[1:39:42] <shotgang86> what a thrill
[1:39:47] <natebud> Did you notice they reused that door animation from RE3?
[1:39:49] <%D3rrtyD4n> oh boy, this is gonna suck
[1:39:50] <%rdark_ksu> Yo Pat tell Paige that because she talked about it I'm right now bout to try my hand at pasta puttanesca psaDab
[1:39:51] <rearedlogarithm> It is kind of cool that Chris is actually in charge of people instead of wandering around in the wilderness by himself.
[1:39:52] <%heartlesshealer> nooo
[1:39:56] <%lionmanguy> Really you should have played this and some better one side by side, just swap out between chapters to keep yourself alive
[1:40:00] <+mans51> what a manly jump
[1:40:03] <Neo_Kaiser> Did Pat notice that the Emblem sound effect was ripped straight from DMC1?
[1:40:07] <%SolidusRex> People die when they are killed
[1:40:08] <DesuDesuDokiDoki> yay
[1:40:08] <%maskofmichael> This game is making me sleepy
[1:40:09] <Higaraishi> man that shirt must be 90% sweat

[1:40:23] <%Th3SmartAlec> @SLVRBAKSLPZ Isn;t it wierd how these people are coming from nowhere in droves to willingly be turned into monsters to fight in a ....some sort of conflict for some reason
[1:40:24] <tigerfang86> .....
[1:40:24] <C24U> Inventory management

[1:40:51] <rolpunk> @PatStaresAt how many times has Pat played this crapola? Pretty specific on the criticism. Granted, this game blows bigtime.

[1:41:07] <%anticrust> UWAGGGGGGGGGGHHHHHHHH
[1:41:10] <%optimasmaximas> @CrimsonCore90 i think its a symptom of RE naturally evolving over time but not being able to effectively transition between styles whilst also including a fun balance for each player to enjoy
[1:41:10] <%Zaphire_Saucypants> I guess the asian blood makes them turn into grasshoppers
[1:41:11] <%EuropanLamprey> No, seriously, are these Cave Johnson's Mantis Men?
[1:41:12] <codycurry52> I'm dead
[1:41:14] <%trustycoyote> Remind me again, chat, you play through the same story each campaign but from a different perspective?

[1:41:41] <%tizz86> tizz86 gifted a Tier 1 sub to tigerfang86! They have given 186 Gift Subs in the channel! 
[1:41:42] <+AcidBrandon> You fight a helicopter in RE3!
[1:41:43] <%NekoUrabe> You have fought dumber things in this series
[1:41:43] <LillethBlue> ACTION
[1:41:44] <%krawtch> put a health bar on screen, why don't you
[1:41:44] <wrydiculous> thats hella fast
[1:41:44] <MJIB01> DMC2 did it better.
[1:41:44] <Neo_Kaiser> It's the same chopper Jake fights. Cause they're right below you right now.
[1:41:44] <codycurry52> DMC2 did it better
[1:41:47] <DesuDesuDokiDoki> do you rike it?
[1:41:48] <+NitronStreams> BIO-COPTER
[1:41:49] <Gr4ndm4rsh4ll> It could be worse, the chopper could be infected with the C Virus
[1:41:50] <+PanicSwytch> MGS1 does it better
[1:41:51] <%SeventyForce> Stun it and do a mid air stinger into trillion stab
[1:41:51] <ahbhajit> Ironically, this isn't the first time you fight a Helicopter in RE. But in RE3 it's a high stakes boss battle at the end, not the middle
[1:41:52] <+Zereaux> QUICK USE YOUR NIKITA MISSLES PAT
[1:41:52] <%Erimos> Jake's is horribly inconsistent.
[1:41:54] <taquito_blade> yea
[1:41:54] <%SirGO0SE> re6 is literally the dmc 2 of resident evil
[1:41:57] <jijipose> PLay as Sherry, she cute and has a cool stun rod
[1:41:58] <%Deft_Thought> SNOWMOBILES! WOOOO!
[1:41:58] <natebud> There is a level in Uncharted 2 where you havea rooftop fight with a helicopter with this exact grenade launcher
[1:41:58] <Blank9> jake's part is the absolute best
[1:42:00] <zv1neda> imagine a resident evil game with a HELICOPTER boss fight oh wait...
[1:42:00] <%Th3SmartAlec> WESKERRRRRRRRRRRRR
[1:42:03] <taquito_blade> their "nemesis"
[1:42:04] <%tigerfang86> yo thanks @tizz86
[1:42:05] <$TheTrueZyozz> I mean, that is not the ridiculous part. It's that you're fighting a helicopter...IN RESIDENT EVIL!!!
[1:42:06] <Varadox> Jake's part is "better" because you can go FISTS and punch people.
[1:42:07] <+Neoepochx> "YOU KILLED MY DADDY!"
[1:42:08] <%Typhaeon> The Further Adventures of Rig from DoA & Sherry
[1:42:08] <Xenodile> wow, that hit feedback on that nade launcher was really flaccid.
[1:42:08] <%AwesomeDan_> Chapter 2 is wandering in the friggin snow i think?
[1:42:08] <RyanTheRecluse> This is a 360/PS3 game so yeah a helicopter fight seems about right
[1:42:08] <Dragon_Batman> That their kidnapped mission?
[1:42:09] <%Zaphire_Saucypants> *whispers* Weskerrrrr...
[1:42:09] <%Literal___Nobody> Did Chris get Grenade Launcher lessons from Jill or Claire
[1:42:09] <+Starlight_Gamer> is the ada section better?
[1:42:09] <$TheTrueZyozz> God, this game sucks.
[1:42:10] <pootybutt1> you get chased by a really dumb nemesis in jake's part
[1:42:11] <nademonkey1100> how old is sherry now
[1:42:12] <+Pyroclase> Oh yeah, I was wrong, the snow level is the absolute worst
[1:42:12] <%optimasmaximas> @Th3SmartAlec i think its that theyre in the passenger seat instead of the driver seat
[1:42:12] <codycurry52> Jake looks so dumb
[1:42:13] <%cdrom321> @PatStaresAt Is that the stealth parts?
[1:42:14] <%heartlesshealer> Sherry deserves better
[1:42:15] <%VashyronM> Jake PUNCH
[1:42:15] <LillethBlue> The snow mountain one is the worst, right?
[1:42:17] <KeiPrime> old enough
[1:42:18] <%tizz86> @tigerfang86 dab on goblidyte
[1:42:18] <%doc_ock_rokc> @Th3SmartAlec One strain has Plagus DNA thus makes Plagus like people
[1:42:18] <Higaraishi> chris is angst
[1:42:19] <myriad_truth> Sherry is 26
[1:42:19] <Neo_Kaiser> Remember the bike chase?
[1:42:19] <%Th3SmartAlec> Wow Chris that's great
[1:42:20] <%Aracon_> can chris not be an asshole for 2 seconds
[1:42:20] <%YakumoYomi> Jake has that shitty motorcycle sequence right before this section

[1:46:49] <TafferAA> chasing this snake is suicidal
[1:46:49] <TheHeroAppears> he's okay
[1:46:51] <+Zereaux> @PatStaresAt that laser effect is cool

[1:47:08] <%Erimos> I think the laser reflection is a cool effect.
[1:47:08] <nuane> SNAKEY
[1:47:10] <ricky12k> Well if someone don’t bring chris out of retirement he would been fine/dead from alcohol posioning. Guy has PTSD and it was not a good idea to use someone that’s under extreme levels of stress.

[1:47:17] <%Zaphire_Saucypants> Yawn 2 Electric Boogaloo.
[1:47:18] <+LyricalJesus> What we're not realizing is that Chris' PTSD is just an excuse Chris is using so he has a reason to kill Ada, ensuring the Redfield bloodline continues
[1:47:18] <sothatsprettybrutal> the snake couldn't have known about the existence of lasers

[1:51:48] <DesuDesuDokiDoki> SNAKE WRESTLING
[1:51:51] <%heartlesshealer> RE6 is happening
[1:51:54] <taquito_blade> PUNCHIT CHRIS
[1:51:54] <%Dementedpenguin> Chris' plot armor is insane
[1:51:54] <myriad_truth> DId he pick it up???
[1:51:57] <%peachy996> This is the same man who killed Albert Wesker
[1:51:57] <OswaldTheDog> oh he a big boy tho
[1:51:57] <onionfryman> No wonder he lost so many men
[1:51:57] <+Neoepochx> He punched a boulder you know?
[1:51:58] <+Starlight_Gamer> this or the snake from harry potter?
[1:51:59] <Drusain> just punch it chris
[1:52:01] <%Dr_DangerPhD> If Chris punched it once it'd probably be dead already
[1:52:06] <%peachy996> Let that sink in
[1:52:09] <%mankeytennis> Giant invisible snake seems an inefficient way to clear a tenament block

[1:52:12] <C24U> Looks like it's inviso is working on Pat
[1:52:13] <%CptDouglasJFalcon> CptDouglasJFalcon is gifting 1 Tier 1 Subs to PatStaresAt's community! They've gifted a total of 1 in the channel! 
[1:52:13] <+Pookiedaexzile> No you're Pat
[1:52:14] <%CptDouglasJFalcon> CptDouglasJFalcon gifted a Tier 1 sub to Elky3! 
[1:52:14] <Slimeking_Mike> Even fucking Paige could see this shit
[1:52:17] <%Erimos> I wonder if Chris not mentioning its similarity to Yawn means that Jill canonically fights Yawn.
[1:52:18] <+Pyroclase> @Starlight_Gamer the harry potter one for sure, the wiggly teeth freak me out
[1:52:18] <Blank9> if ammo's an issue, you could always use knife
[1:52:19] <%Th3SmartAlec> ........
[1:52:19] <biomegabear> This snake seems more survival horror than anything in Leons story
[1:52:20] <Neo_Kaiser> There is no giant snake in Harry Potter.
[1:52:22] <jack_is_here> if chris can pick the entire snake up why doesnt he just use it as a whip
[1:52:22] <nuane> super scary
[1:52:24] <agadejobi> You would think that an invisible snake would be a great hunter
[1:52:24] <%moondog_> WHERE IS IT?!?!?! as literally everything near it starts exploding
[1:52:29] <rytisone> Chris would survive Anaconda movie no problem
[1:52:29] <%Th3SmartAlec> GO TO POINT B PLAYER
[1:52:30] <$joylent_blue> how can you tell its gone ITS INVISIBLE
[1:52:31] <+Pyroclase> @Neo_Kaiser chamber of secrets, dude
[1:52:33] <KeiPrime> theres a basilisk, its kind of a giant snake
[1:52:36] <myriad_truth> RIGHT THERE!!
[1:52:37] <%DatGuyJimbo> so did the c virus make this snake?
[1:52:37] <CrimsonCore90> Fast and Hard!
[1:52:39] <+VariantX7> Snake aint tougher than those boulders he punches
[1:52:41] <Neo_Kaiser> That was a Basilisk, not a snake.
[1:52:43] <%goose_attack_almanac> How is a 10,000 pound snake not pulling the roof apart
[1:52:46] <%Conyst> not gonna lie this fight is why I voted for RE6 it's just so ridiculous
[1:52:48] <natebud> fuck you snake!
[1:52:51] <$PhantomMiG> The bosses run for way to damn long
[1:52:51] <%krawtch> die you poopy snake
[1:52:52] <thelonechris> He's so pissed at this snake
[1:53:00] <%heartlesshealer> it's full of shit, so his men are shit. Good job Chris
[1:53:01] <%Th3SmartAlec> ...Resident Evil characters swearing like sailors is a real turn off
[1:53:01] <%johnny_gogo> Bro wtf im not here
[1:53:02] <+ledgefiendd> does this game have stakes or consequences?
[1:53:04] <$Wafflum> Hey now, the only RE game I've played is 7, but I'm sure that you're not actually Chris right now. barbToxic
[1:53:04] <Xenodile> Y'know, seeing how Chris can get out of its coils by just lifting it up, it has to be like genuinely kind of weak and pathetic
[1:53:05] <tyrano_the_wise> I kinda like the weird insect leg teeth
[1:53:05] <rearedlogarithm> Marco's magic.
[1:53:06] <wrydiculous> oh yea flash dun work if i recall correctly
[1:53:07] <+TheBitingIrish> Did he just shoot a tooth out?
[1:53:12] <bigbradish> Did you just get a checkpoint in the middle of a fight?
[1:53:21] <%Typhaeon> This thing should not have a head at this point
[1:53:22] <nuane> @DatGuyJimbo The C-Virus made half human half spider zombie terrorists still sentient enough to take hostages
[1:53:24] <natebud> Honestly, this is just alright
[1:53:25] <biomegabear> oh no
[1:53:25] <taquito_blade> how much longer????
[1:53:27] <talisign> That's the 2nd in fight checkpoint
[1:53:27] <rcand9> so boring
[1:53:27] <+TheBitingIrish> omg the quick shot still works LUL
[1:53:27] <Dragon_Batman> That's fine
[1:53:28] <+dane332> probably damage check points
[1:53:30] <KeiPrime> i dont remember the basilisk in harry potter having feet
[1:53:33] <TafferAA> even the devs know you don't want to do all this shit again
[1:53:35] <%Th3SmartAlec> The game should just cut to the next cutscene at this point
[1:53:36] <%johnny_gogo> Probably 1 shots thats why
[1:53:36] <Hellarussian> you need the sworf of Gryffindor
[1:53:39] <%KaosMachina> ISN'T THIS SO MUCH LIKE RE1 YOU GUYS

[2:01:16] <gunzerkingdunce> Theres so much gay tension
[2:01:16] <%Aracon_> Chris is such a little bitch here holy shit
[2:01:17] <%VashyronM> It's probably why Jill isn't around.
[2:01:18] <%Typhaeon> Jake the Dog would have a few choice words for Chris too
[2:01:18] <sothatsprettybrutal> redundant

[2:01:34] <SleepyMaribo> so are bees going o be a normal enemy now? if so, fuck off this game, wtf...
[2:01:35] <talisign> And neither of them knew Marco was just a bunch of bees
[2:01:40] <+xGreenflame> Literally just proves his point
[2:01:40] <+Pookiedaexzile> Chris's Twink is just a tease, he knows ho to get em riled up for the "mission"
[2:01:41] <drinkmoxie> So why is Ada turning the soldiers into monsters. Is there an actual reason or does she think they are working with Simmons?
[2:01:41] <+Nicholas0123> piers gets a good ending tho
[2:01:49] <%Th3SmartAlec> LUL

[2:01:57] <%TheMattman1313> THE BLOODLINE PAT
[2:01:58] <+Sp3ctre48> I love how they gave Chris another tragic backstory for him to endlessly angst about

[2:02:06] <%sjay449> THE BLOODLINE
[2:02:07] <%AxelCezar> HAVE YOU SEEN LEON'S ANGEL FACE?

[2:02:07] <MyNameIsRasus> THE BLOODLINE

[2:02:09] <%croxeye> Chris REALLY wants Leon to bang Claire Pat
[2:02:10] <Blank9> LEON PLEASE
[2:02:10] <bleugh> they're best friends off screen
[2:02:10] <myriad_truth> Leon is like that though
[2:02:11] <MrDonTacos_> NO TIME FOR THAT PAT
[2:02:11] <%Sir_stride> ITS THE BLOODLINE
[2:02:11] <Dragon_Batman> Maybe because his sister vouches for him?
[2:02:11] <cesare92x> in CVX Leon contacts Chris to help claire
[2:02:11] <jorniev> ITS THE BLOODLINE THING PAT
[2:02:12] <energywarning> leon is using his super secret agent powers
[2:02:12] <$PhantomMiG> After bringing Chris into this mission
[2:02:12] <gunzerkingdunce> HE NEEDS LEON TO FUCK CLAIRE
[2:02:12] <%NovaKnightmare> BLOODLINE THO
[2:02:13] <%Th3SmartAlec> HE NEEDS THAT KENNEDY SPERM
[2:02:13] <%goose_attack_almanac> HOW
[2:02:13] <VizualBlitz> leon is the future of the bloodline
[2:02:13] <KeiPrime> SOMEONE has to plow his sister, Pat
[2:02:13] <LillethBlue> But Claire likes Leon sooo
[2:02:14] <+Pyroclase> OH BOY IT'S VEHICLE TIME
[2:02:14] <%VashyronM> Because Chris knows that Leon has been through just as much as shit as him
[2:02:15] <%xUmbraNinja> Leon’s got that swag tho
[2:02:16] <%Typhaeon> The harbor isn't in the city?
[2:02:16] <OkamiDude15> its the bloodline

[2:02:17] <+linSP> Leon pls
[2:02:17] <%goose_attack_almanac> ITS BEEN 3 MINUTES
[2:02:17] <%Aracon_> because leon is super important despite barely interacting with chris
[2:02:18] <%maskofmichael> Character Development
[2:02:18] <%Zaphire_Saucypants> Leon exudes pheromones that chills people out, Pat.
[2:02:19] <+MysteriousDrX> There was the prequel manga Biohazard: Marhawa Desire
[2:02:19] <%Owkono> big dick energy
[2:02:19] <%Huntercd> Jill should be there
[2:02:20] <+Qsmash_> Leon has 100 Speech
[2:02:20] <+prime_name> Isn't there two Adas?
[2:02:20] <%SoFarFetched> CHRIS COULDN'T GET MAD AT LEON CAUSE HE HAS THE POTENTIAL TO CONTINUE THE REDFIELD BLOODLINE
[2:02:20] <tyrano_the_wise> oh no...
[2:02:20] <$frankthetank285> yeah Chris should have just killed the fuck out of her
[2:02:21] <nuane> THE BLOODLINE TAKE PRIOTIYU
[2:02:21] <Milo_san> Leon is hot thats why
[2:02:21] <natebud> LEON earned that respect with RE4
[2:02:21] <Klarrann3> Leon needs to carry on the bloodline
[2:02:22] <cache_22> They found her real fast.
[2:02:22] <%Ran196> He still wants leon to bone Claire
[2:02:23] <%krawtch> Leon holds the Redfield bloodline hostage though
[2:02:23] <%johnny_gogo> CAR TIME
[2:02:23] <Kemmybelle> Cause Chris wants Leon to impregnate Claire & needs to make a good impression.
[2:02:23] <MyNameIsRasus> COME ABOARD AND BRING ALONG
[2:02:25] <ahbhajit> Chris traded a favor for a favor
[2:02:25] <%tank7013> @drinkmoxie There's an actual reason for it. We MIGHT learn it during Chris's campaign, can't remember
[2:02:28] <+tsatoma> tomatoDisgust

[2:02:29] <%heartlesshealer> HAVE YOU SEEN LEON'S DNA AND CONTRIBUTION TO THE REDFIELD GENE POOL?!
[2:02:30] <Dragon_Batman> Yeeea this bit is not great
[2:02:31] <cesare92x> it implies that Leon a Chris known eachother since.l cvx
[2:02:31] <wahilliham> Hasnt he at least known who leon is for years tho?
[2:02:31] <%cervidaequus> Leon was sending emails to Chris in CVX

[2:02:43] <%Dementedpenguin> REALLY, Chris??
[2:02:44] <rearedlogarithm> You did.
[2:02:44] <%Admiral_PopnFresh> If Piers was an actual soldier he'd have peaced out a while ago, Piers is just gay for boulder punching biceps
[2:02:45] <%Th3SmartAlec> THATS WHY ALL YOUR MEN ARE DEAD

[2:03:01] <PrettyThickandStrongDyck> He never met the REAL ada though
[2:03:02] <%tank7013> One of your men JUST died because you fell for her bullshit
[2:03:02] <gamezerox> Jill goes presumely dead and Chris is somewhat fine. Finn dies and it's instant drinking and PTSD
[2:03:04] <MayorRev> Is there anything this game could throw at you that'd make you turn this game off
[2:03:07] <mateonofeo13> Potty mouth
[2:03:07] <%peachy996> The writing for Chris is the absolute worst its ever been.
[2:03:08] <TikanZK> i will gladly fall for all of Ada's bullshit Kreygasm
[2:03:09] <%Th3SmartAlec> REDFIELD BLOODLINE IS LESS STUPID THAN THIS
[2:03:10] <%heartlesshealer> I refuse to believe the Sherry chapter is worse than this
[2:03:11] <%DensityD> WHAT IS THIS GAME?!!?!
[2:03:11] <+Neoepochx> Man...this game is so scurry
[2:03:12] <%cdrom321> I remember this in the Jake campaign.
[2:03:13] <rancidkill64_> Ada’s redesign for this game is so bad
[2:03:15] <biomegabear> shenmue boats

[2:03:25] <nuane> time in China is convoluted

[2:03:34] <SauceJockey> I NEED TO KILL ADA SO LEON WILL FUCK MY SISTER
[2:03:35] <+Starlight_Gamer> what chapter is this?
[2:03:35] <%Dementedpenguin> Chris casually dodging snipers like it's a Sunday.
[2:03:36] <%xUmbraNinja> All you wanted this trash. Enjoy!
[2:03:37] <%Zaphire_Saucypants> this is annoying
[2:03:37] <%cervidaequus> @snektor you missed yon, and swarm of bees man
[2:03:39] <%johnny_gogo> I wish this was a really big bridge rather then this
[2:03:41] <%DensityD> WHO? WHO DEFENDS?

[2:03:48] <rytisone> Piers has a sniper rifle
[2:03:49] <%the_vedo_show> nvm LUL
[2:03:51] <Finakala> @Snektor You missed Chris shooting a swarm of bees with a machinegun
[2:03:51] <%wruce_> So does this game take place in the adult timeline, the child timline, or the ruined timeline?
[2:03:51] <cesare92x> Chris lost 4 teams so far, 1 in re5 2 in re6 1 in re7
[2:03:51] <+Neoepochx> You know why this game is so scary? Because it left us thinking that it was going to be it for RE after this.
[2:03:52] <+mans51> is he using a shotgun against that sniper?
[2:03:53] <%Th3SmartAlec> @SauceJockey This is a better plot. Like actually, compared to what we've been seeing
[2:03:54] <dukenux> Piers is his 2nd choice
[2:03:57] <mateonofeo13> Yay war crimes
[2:03:57] <%krawtch> Piers we can hear you using a shotgun
[2:04:00] <+Skelegroove> Piers is using a shotgun
[2:04:00] <%The_Chris27> use the boat
[2:04:01] <%the_vedo_show> Lmao he got hot
[2:04:03] <nademonkey1100> if this wasnt an re game it would probably be fine
[2:04:05] <Snektor> @cervidaequus ahh darn. Gotta remember to see the vod
[2:04:07] <GarettLefebvre> Plays story out of order, complains that timeline makes no sense.
[2:04:09] <natebud> If only AI piers was competant

[2:05:13] <+lazylazzer> I know it's more realistic, but why they gotta give Chris tiny arms/shoulders
[2:05:15] <%cervidaequus> Piers lost the same squad as Chris and yet he’s stone face no grief
[2:05:17] <%Zaphire_Saucypants> isn't worth it

[2:17:11] <%Aleate> Leon literally doesn't get a single fucking hit in during this cutscene

[2:17:38] <wrydiculous> yea that's why this disjointed campaign is dumb
[2:17:39] <%DensityD> What happens when you assume?
[2:17:39] <$frankthetank285> Chris literally watched her do it
[2:17:39] <%Nemesis2098> SHE MURDERED AN ENTIRE SWUADRON LEON
[2:17:42] <%the_vedo_show> atpRtsd atpRtsd
[2:17:42] <%xxshadowxx416> it was her leon
[2:17:44] <rangriz> SUPER SIMPPPP

[2:17:57] <%cervidaequus> LEON S.QUADKILLER KENNEDY
[2:17:57] <StillJustARatInACage> none of the campaigns make any sense by themselves, making each an unsatisfying mess
[2:17:58] <+LyricalJesus> This game is like Rashomon, except bad
[2:17:58] <Jolly_Adventurer> "Leon, she gloated about murdering my men right in front of my face"
[2:17:58] <oruandrew> this should've been done like 999 lol
[2:17:58] <%D00msDayDan> even if ada didn't do ALL of this she still turned marco into bees

[2:18:10] <KeiPrime> all the campaigns, are unlocked at teh start, originally ADa's was locked until you did the first 3, i think?
[2:18:11] <+Starlight_Gamer> no biogrenade
[2:18:11] <talisign> DAMN YOU SIMMONS!
[2:18:11] <natebud> Costs too much
[2:18:12] <%TheMattman1313> No because Leon is there
[2:18:12] <%tigerfang86> She only had ONE Syringe grenade
[2:18:14] <%Th3SmartAlec> ....she would have killed them all so easy
[2:18:15] <+Zereaux> PEIRS TAKE THE FUCKING SHOT YOU IDIOT
[2:18:15] <oruandrew> too much monie
[2:18:15] <+BizarreRevolver> they have both killed for less
[2:18:15] <rytisone> that would hit her too
[2:18:16] <%goose_attack_almanac> where did she pull that from
[2:18:16] <DuoScratch> Good ole LEON "THE SIMP" KENNEDY!
[2:18:16] <%cervidaequus> Protect leon

[2:18:21] <+TDotGoat> Ada Awaaay
[2:18:22] <%valriot> @patstaresat I mean I think it's fine having a "huh who?" moment in a split story, but this is literally the same cutscene twice

[2:18:33] <YamadaZero> Everything he did, he did for the good of the country.
[2:18:34] <CurrySauseBandit> Why would she use a syringe grenade that close to her though?

[2:34:19] <+matt_mcgrump> can we play binary domain instead of this Pat?
[2:34:19] <biomegabear> They should of used this music for the main game
[2:34:20] <critfumble_> ITS TIME FOR BO POSTING
[2:34:22] <Dragon_Batman> I beat all of em before that
[2:34:23] <%moondog_> he is a mountain of a man
[2:34:23] <DrkJP520> I didn''t know about that patch, and I played the game years after it came out...
[2:34:27] <AntChodeny> i couldn't bring myself to finish the game
[2:34:27] <Valentinius_Anodyne> I wish the rest of the game had music as good as that
[2:34:28] <Dragon_Batman> It sucked
[2:34:31] <Nightwing_B01> flawless emongSmile
[2:34:34] <GarettLefebvre> That patch came out on PS3?
[2:34:34] <+Pyroclase> !time

[2:34:39] <+Starlight_Gamer> its fine pat
[2:34:40] <+KhorneBerzerkerRU55IO> That's implying I even touched Mercenaries
[2:34:41] <%shiplord13> its cool
[2:34:41] <%JJCheeker> Once I took this game out of my Xbox it never returned
[2:34:42] <PrettyThickandStrongDyck> Take a break Pat
[2:34:43] <%nofestu2> polish it off
[2:34:47] <wrydiculous> it's gonna get rotten later
[2:34:49] <Nightwing_B01> we angy kmaAnger

[2:34:51] <%heartlesshealer> RESTORE MENTAL ENERGY
[2:34:53] <%YakumoYomi> Only so much RE6 poison you can take.
[2:34:55] <%Th3SmartAlec> "no, THIS is the worst part of the game"
[2:34:56] <%SirGO0SE> psaRaffle
[2:34:56] <%MisterTylerrr> At least Sherry and Jake isn't quite as bad
[2:34:57] <%NekoUrabe> psaCrazyhand
[2:34:57] <LillethBlue> Quality > Quantity, no worries
[2:34:58] <%Aracon_> I can't handle this game tonight either
[2:35:00] <Cobaltor_252> did he punch the boulder yet?
[2:35:10] <%heartlesshealer> he punched the glass
[2:35:10] <%Corporate_Redeemer> DON'T FORGET ABOUT ADA'S AWFUL CAMPAIGN OF AWFULNESS
[2:35:11] <+KhorneBerzerkerRU55IO> Soon
[2:35:13] <$monkeyhous3> play the entire game tonight you coward
[2:35:15] <+Pookiedaexzile> These RE 6 defenders are wyldin
[2:35:18] <Clu_Flynn> Leon's is far worse than this shit, and Jake might be even worse
[2:35:21] <+Rolandknight> what a coward lol Kappa
[2:35:23] <Dragon_Batman> Nah he ripped out a organ thing from a giant creature tho
[2:35:26] <%Jack_of_No_Trades> anyone know what the name of that merc song is?
[2:35:27] <%Th3SmartAlec> Okay, so the impression I've gotten is that Ada's campaign actually explains the plot?
[2:35:32] <+Starlight_Gamer> is the ada section better?
[2:35:36] <Clu_Flynn> different kinds of shit, all shit
[2:35:38] <%SirGO0SE> i second this @Jack_of_No_Trades
[2:35:42] <Clu_Flynn> Ada's campaign is worse
[2:35:43] <+gambit_gamble> More quantities plz
[2:35:44] <+KhorneBerzerkerRU55IO> Not really
[2:35:46] <%MisterTylerrr> Tell him to finish the stream and quickly go raid PLague
[2:35:46] <Dragon_Batman> I would look up the china level if anything
[2:35:51] <C24U> Ada section is best in Co-Op
[2:35:56] <+KhorneBerzerkerRU55IO> The game is a shitstorm
[2:35:59] <%Shadowpint> Is it true that if you play Ada's co-op player 2 can't interact with anything so they just kind of have to sit there when there's puzzles.
[2:35:59] <%Corporate_Redeemer> Ada's section is not better.
[2:36:00] <AntChodeny> how can anyone defend this game? even if you haven't played the previous ones this game isn't fun
[2:36:11] <Khester824> Play Jake campaign with Paige coward
[2:36:14] <Clu_Flynn> LMAO yeah play Ada in co op to laugh and your partner's inability to open doors
[2:36:15] <%Zaphire_Saucypants> @Shadowpint yes. They can't open doors either
[2:36:23] <trueherobappo> And some of you wanted him to play this game..
[2:36:23] <%scaryboisupreme> Oh there's a handwave line that clears Ada's name at the end
[2:36:26] <%scaryboisupreme> ok
[2:36:32] <%SirGO0SE> @AntChodeny game sucks, stream is S tier
[2:36:33] <%peachy996> @Shadowpint Ada's Co-Op partner is some random irrelevant Agent
[2:36:35] <Neo_Kaiser> Watch Adams playthrough of RE6 co-op
[2:36:40] <%cdrom321> @Shadowpint And magically appear behind Ada every time she uses the grapple.
[2:36:42] <Clu_Flynn> why is twitch being weird with the audio
[2:36:45] <Dragon_Batman> He was doing a retrospective of the RE series, this needed to happen
[2:36:52] <%NekoUrabe> @Jack_of_No_Trades I think it is just Mercenaries theme 1
[2:36:54] <%JJCheeker> Wow plague is streaming
[2:36:56] <+KhorneBerzerkerRU55IO> I wish it didn't though
[2:36:59] <C24U> Reason Ada section best in Co-Op is due to partner can't do ANYTHING with interactables and they can lock Ada out of doors by triggering shit
[2:37:02] <%Th3SmartAlec> @scaryboisupreme ...let's just forget about RE5 then.
[2:37:15] <%Jack_of_No_Trades> @SirGO0SE Found it. Youtube RE6 Mercenaries theme and get the extended one from FrenchyStarFox
[2:37:17] <Dragon_Batman> We must never forget the bad, so that we may move foward
[2:37:18] <Clu_Flynn> what was after this? Rev2 and thats it?
[2:37:27] <%peachy996> 7 or Rev2
[2:37:30] <%Jack_of_No_Trades> @NekoUrabe Thanks Neko!
[2:37:30] <+locutus_of_the_porg> dspWassap what's up chat
[2:37:34] <Neo_Kaiser> Ada should have been teamed up with HUNK
[2:37:34] <Dragon_Batman> I think Rev 2
[2:37:37] <%peachy996> Forget which came out first
[2:37:38] <%SirGO0SE> @Jack_of_No_Trades nice PogChamp
[2:37:40] <%krawtch> hes going by release order
[2:37:41] <trueherobappo> why did we force him into this...
[2:37:43] <%Th3SmartAlec> @SirGO0SE apparently called 'Heat on Beat' also
[2:37:46] <AntChodeny> Rev 2 then RE7
[2:37:47] <Clu_Flynn> oh no not 7
[2:37:48] <%krawtch> so Rev2 came out before 7
[2:37:49] <%peachy996> Because we had to know
[2:37:56] <%peachy996> And now we know
[2:37:59] <%NekoUrabe> @Jack_of_No_Trades :D
[2:38:00] <Clu_Flynn> Rev 2 was like... 2015 or something
[2:38:01] <%cdrom321> @peachy996 Rev2 before 7.
[2:38:03] <%peachy996> And now we cry because we know
[2:38:06] <%Meekest> Let's skip the rest of RE6
[2:38:08] <trueherobappo> @peachy996 We already knew..
[2:38:11] <%lionmanguy> Wait I had to step away what'd I miss is there more?
[2:38:17] <Dragon_Batman> God I look back and can't believe I beat RE6
[2:38:20] <C24U> We all are Pat
[2:38:23] <Tidus0203> wow what a handsome man, instant follow
[2:38:25] <%Valdorick> Its a day that starts in a Y
[2:38:25] <%VashyronM> Cause you hate RE6
[2:38:25] <biomegabear> Elmo is sick of RE6
[2:38:27] <Clu_Flynn> Pat should just watch the RE cutscenes and pretend he played it
[2:38:27] <%Th3SmartAlec> @Meekest No, we have to see this through
[2:38:30] <%Corporate_Redeemer> psaPorgmo psaPorgmo psaPorgmo psaPorgmo
[2:38:31] <chronoxgp> I guess that makes two of us.

[2:38:36] <%TheSniperJoe> Jesus Christ, are we STILL playing RE6?!
[2:38:37] <%Dementedpenguin> Negative RE6 energy he feels
[2:38:40] <%XzileGaming> cause of the short stream, elmo angry
[2:38:40] <+dante_must_die_exe> either baby is sick of RE6 or wants more
[2:38:41] <%Jack_of_No_Trades> @SirGO0SE @NekoUrabe It looks like the composer commented on the youtube vid, just as a cool note
[2:38:44] <%tank7013> I'm so goddamn excited for chat to see some of the other shit that happens in this game
[2:38:45] <+KhorneBerzerkerRU55IO> Elmo hates RE6
[2:38:49] <%morcego_cinzento_arts> Elmo is the only cure from all that terrible RE6 boredom
[2:38:49] <PrettyThickandStrongDyck> sipsipElmo sipsipElmo sipsipElmo

[2:38:51] <Dragon_Batman> @AntChodeny Thank you, all will power
[2:38:52] <+Neoepochx> @PatStaresAt Did you see that Kamiya wanted to make Okami 2, Dante v Bayo, and DMC 0?
[2:38:53] <%Th3SmartAlec> Elmo's about to tell us all why Ada should be shot
[2:38:54] <$monkeyhous3> Elmo wants more RE6
[2:38:55] <%XzileGaming> ELMO hates short streams
[2:38:58] <DSD24> RE6 has good Mercs
[2:38:58] <%VashyronM> Oh, we know
[2:38:59] <%TheMattman1313> So 5 Streams left?
[2:38:59] <%DrSoulDraig> phone
[2:39:01] <$monkeyhous3> DO IT FOR ELMO
[2:39:02] <DrkJP520> I forgot

[2:39:02] <+locutus_of_the_porg> dspJasper dspJasper dspJasper
[2:39:06] <Clu_Flynn> and this sold over 4 million units
[2:39:11] <%SoFarFetched> EMAIL CAPCOM
[2:39:16] <+dante_must_die_exe> Dante X Bayo
[2:39:16] <%SoFarFetched> TELL THEM STOP HAVING SHIT GAMES
[2:39:18] <%Aracon_> DvB would be way more exciting
[2:39:18] <+Caidezes> Okami 2 please. Okamiden was so bad.
[2:39:19] <Dragon_Batman> Didn't realize he mentioned that, sick
[2:39:20] <+Andrizzleton> who did paige slight today?
[2:39:23] <Valentinius_Anodyne> That's just the SMT mobile game B)
[2:39:23] <+Neoepochx> Any one of those would have my rocks hard
[2:39:24] <C24U> DMC 0 = Play as Sparta?
[2:39:25] <Dragon_Batman> All of the above
[2:39:27] <chronoxgp> kamiya didn't make dante he f'd it up lol
[2:39:34] <Neo_Kaiser> Why not just have a Dante skin in Bayo?
[2:39:35] <trueherobappo> @patstaresat You should take a week off after this stream.
[2:39:35] <+Starlight_Gamer> wheres paige?
[2:39:35] <+Aullama> Gib him tummy rubs!
[2:39:36] <%lutefiiisk> You should brief woolie on how bad RE6 is.
[2:39:37] <%Dementedpenguin> Dante vs Bayo sounds like a Devilman plot
[2:39:40] <%Aracon_> DMC0 seems real unnecessary imo
[2:39:41] <%Th3SmartAlec> Problem with Dante v Bayo is that I feel that Bayo's in a whole other league
[2:39:47] <peachteagaming> cat lover
[2:39:47] <%Aracon_> sparda is better off as a legend we never see
[2:39:49] <trianglehat> no time!

[2:41:01] <Xenodile> The biggest problem with Dante VS Bayo is they have no actual reason to fight each other, it's just against their personalities to try and kill each other Just Because

[2:51:11] <%heartlesshealer> oh, this stupid poll

[2:52:02] <faithless_zealot> That's honestly one fo the best systems for a game like that
[2:52:06] <%templar010> yeep
[2:52:07] <Slim_Lipid> Menuing, BUT FAST THO is a great way to make your game feel terrible
[2:52:11] <Zooperton> Almost like it's DnD or something 🤔
[2:52:14] <%YakumoYomi> Original Sin, or OG Divinity?
[2:52:17] <+Andrizzleton> Original Sin 1 + 2
[2:52:19] <%heartlesshealer> ( o_o)b
[2:52:26] <%templar010> Fine by me
[2:52:26] <faithless_zealot> Those original systems sucks dicks
[2:52:28] <Valentinius_Anodyne> Sounds fine to me, that's how closer to how actual D&D plays anyhow
[2:52:32] <+Slice_of_Kris> where they let choas reign
[2:52:33] <Smileyhat> Divinity original sin games are pretty solid games, too.
[2:52:42] <+DinnerCalzone> Realtime crpgs suck
[2:52:44] <+Tevvy> real time with pause is garbage fight me
[2:52:45] <%trustycoyote> Dragon Age was like that too, ,right?
[2:52:51] <%heartlesshealer> because that's what they're good at
[2:52:53] <$Piemono> @PatStaresAt They're adding 5e systems though, no action points, there are bonus & basic actions, etc.
[2:52:53] <%VashyronM> Pillars 2 put turn based in
[2:52:55] <Amplificate> I hope they fix that issue where if an NPC enters fight as it starts it doesn't rob the first player/character of a turn. I hated that so much
[2:52:56] <Dragon_Batman> Makes sense
[2:53:00] <%professormorrigan> RTwP is fine.
[2:53:07] <@SSaryn> Fair enough
[2:53:10] <Bustahhwulf> poop edition
[2:53:11] <Captain_Krunk> Good argument
[2:53:15] <+Starlight_Gamer> so whats the problem?
[2:53:18] <%KishinGrek> So boo?
[2:53:19] <+Andrizzleton> @VashyronM for real?
[2:53:22] <chronoxgp> I'm upset the new contra wasn't a good game
[2:53:25] <%heartlesshealer> legacy fans just mad
[2:53:27] <Neo_Kaiser> Fifth Edition, boo
[2:53:42] <%vaporousTippler> D&D's had turn based games since Gold Box.
[2:53:43] <chronoxgp> neo-contra was kinda cool
[2:53:43] <%VashyronM> @Andrizzleton Yeah. When you start, you choose if you want turn based or not
[2:54:04] <+Lost_Echo> We need a real time with pause Table Top game though
[2:54:05] <%YakumoYomi> I was pausing all the time in Baldur's Gate, but I always played as a spellcasting class
[2:54:09] <%JJCheeker> Honestly I like turn based
[2:54:11] <Dragon_Batman> So some of the hubbub is that it's changing the legacy style of play?
[2:54:11] <+Slice_of_Kris> I honestly hate real time with pause because I would pause constantly anyway making it turn based
[2:54:11] <+Andrizzleton> I don't remember it always being there
[2:54:26] <jjetfuel> @chronoxgp play blazing chrome
[2:54:28] <%templar010> sounds miserable
[2:54:31] <%KishinGrek> What was the deciding factor in this ?
[2:54:33] <%chiluzza> it was miserable
[2:54:35] <%heartlesshealer> murder hobo-ing
[2:54:37] <Slim_Lipid> Smooth brains need flashy Real time combat instead of planning out their actions
[2:54:46] <Neo_Kaiser> It's only miserable to min-maxers like Pat
[2:54:56] <faithless_zealot> Good man
[2:55:07] <chronoxgp> @jjetfuel was playing cuphead on the ferry while commiting a felony
[2:55:15] <Nekros4442> I'm just gonna say...I'm happy Baldurs Gate 3 is basically just D:OS 3. I've moved past the older RTWP CRPGS
[2:55:17] <Dragon_Batman> It sounds like turned base is better suited to it
[2:55:19] <chronoxgp> can't wait for PSO2
[2:55:20] <+RenoDeGeneric> I'm actually interested in it since it's like Divinity. I'll give it a shot
[2:55:20] <faithless_zealot> Yes, exactly
[2:55:26] <faithless_zealot> THNAK YOU!
[2:55:27] <suikudo> water beads can destroy your life is amazing
[2:55:32] <Smileyhat> I'm more concerned about the difficulty we saw in the demonstration, but they did say they still have balancing to do.
[2:55:37] <suikudo> i dont speak bagget but this is funny shit
[2:55:58] <Valentinius_Anodyne> I preferred DOS to BG anyhow, coming from someone who played BG first
[2:55:59] <%professormorrigan> DA:O had good RTwP combat.
[2:56:03] <%NekoUrabe> @suikudo me either buy you can just see the regret LUL
[2:56:14] <%XeroSigmaPrime> Can I play Divinity solo?
[2:56:20] <Nekros4442> @XeroSigmaPrime yes
[2:56:22] <%templar010> divinity 2 is -great-
[2:56:30] <faithless_zealot> @XeroSigmaPrime Yeah, you can play it solo
[2:56:33] <Captain_Krunk> I think Dragon Age Origins did the real time pause thing pretty good. But that's probably because the combat is so slow LUL
[2:56:41] <%Helmed> how did the witcher 3 voice every line
[2:56:43] <%Valdorick> Even narriation
[2:56:45] <%XeroSigmaPrime> Is it okay to play solo or is it dramatically better with people?
[2:56:50] <suikudo> jesus it gets even worse!
[2:56:55] <Valentinius_Anodyne> @XeroSigmaPrime In DOS2 you can at least, and it's probably easier because of the Lone Wolf perk then playing with a team
[2:57:06] <chronoxgp> psaBlep_SG smokeBOMB
[2:57:12] <%XeroSigmaPrime> @Valentinius_Anodyne Perfect, thanks for the info man

[2:57:48] <tiaramaki> psaPorgmo "Famther, I wish for pets!"
[2:57:48] <%Keyd00d> he looked at us
[2:57:54] <%afronooch> let him speak
[2:57:55] <Captain_Krunk> And that is the #1 problem with turn based, and why it scares away a lot of people
[2:57:59] <dan_g_v> elml makes some compelling arguments
[2:57:59] <%afronooch> emlo want speak
[2:58:02] <%mister___doctor> Meow into the mic!
[2:58:07] <dan_g_v> elmo even

[2:59:06] <Nekros4442> Yes, and I fucking love it
[2:59:07] <%heartlesshealer> options are good
[2:59:08] <Captain_Krunk> That's because it's not all about combat
[2:59:10] <RantingRavager> BARRELS OF DEATHFOG
[2:59:13] <koffeemancer> Divinity even has the game master mode @PatStaresAt
[2:59:13] <Nekros4442> The options are all there
[2:59:14] <%heartlesshealer> aww, he lick the Pat
[2:59:22] <Dragon_Batman> From what you streamed of it it looked really neat and deep
[2:59:24] <+RenoDeGeneric> Literally pick up a candle from the background and blow up an oil bomb
[2:59:31] <%mister___doctor> I was about to leave before Elno showed up
[2:59:32] <%Valdorick> The funny thing is, with a strong enough stealth build, DOS2 can be played as real time.
[2:59:36] <Sain0127> WHAT ARE WE GONNA DO WITH THE BODIES MAN?!
[2:59:40] <Sain0127> wait wrong chat
[2:59:42] <%YakumoYomi> Load up a crate with a bunch of shit, and hurl it at people with telekinesis
[2:59:47] <%professormorrigan> Divinity 2: Just teleport your party members out, rest to full HP and re-engage. Amazing. Kappa
[2:59:48] <Nekros4442> You aint wrong
[2:59:51] <Zooperton> true LUL
[2:59:54] <Nekros4442> I care about DnD way more lol
[2:59:55] <problemagic> it's off brand dnd
[2:59:55] <faithless_zealot> Not False
[2:59:56] <Dragon_Batman> Fair
[3:00:04] <%vaporousTippler> The most interesting parts of Divinity's setting are stuck in the worst games.
[3:00:05] <Dragon_Batman> Which are dope
[3:00:05] <%heartlesshealer> ...
[3:00:06] <problemagic> SPELLJAMMING
[3:00:08] <%TheWinged7> I loved playing Pillars 1 and did multiple playthroughs, even doing a solo path of iron, but somethying about pillars 2 just couldnt grab me
[3:00:08] <%VashyronM> People are basically whining cause "it's not Baldur's Gate"
[3:00:17] <+Andrizzleton> mind goblins
[3:00:21] <Captain_Krunk> :)
[3:00:23] <%heartlesshealer> I'm trying to remember beholders
[3:00:25] <%heartlesshealer> wow
[3:00:25] <%Fenrirlives> GITH BOIS
[3:00:26] <problemagic> bald beholder in doom
[3:00:29] <+Slice_of_Kris> full on dragons
[3:00:37] <%harry_macdougall> dragons crown had a beholder pat
[3:00:38] <+metalsiren31> Neverwinter Nights had beholders pvpWhy
[3:00:38] <%SirGO0SE> LUL
[3:00:38] <%SolidusRex> Ilithids are one of my favorite DnD things ever
[3:00:39] <Zooperton> dragon's dogma had off brand beholders
[3:00:40] <+MuteDanger> But you fight Beholders in Dragon's Dogma
[3:00:48] <Monkeyweed21> Beholder in Dragon's Dogma
[3:00:55] <%chiluzza> yeah thats really it theres a big thread on Bualdersgate reddit calling them all on it
[3:01:06] <problemagic> you right
[3:01:07] <%YakumoYomi> Night time is scary in Dark's Dogma
[3:01:08] <Smileyhat> I loved the first two Baldur's Gates, and I still like the new direction for 3.
[3:01:09] <%harry_macdougall> dragons crown had a beholder pat
[3:01:11] <%Huntercd> Will there be Dark elves?
[3:01:13] <%heartlesshealer> yup
[3:01:18] <%Valentinius_Anodyne> I played it
[3:01:19] <%NekoUrabe> I was 5
[3:01:23] <%SirGO0SE> was it on original xbox? pretty sure i had it
[3:01:23] <+xBolts4Lifex> stop making me feel old
[3:01:24] <suikudo> I remember beating 1 and playing alot of 2
[3:01:26] <+Slice_of_Kris> we also cannot play baulders gate 2 at all on modern pc
[3:01:26] <%heartlesshealer> yup to baldur's gate, no idea on dark elves
[3:01:27] <%42nfl19> In a weird twist, BG3 is even MORE true to the source material
[3:01:27] <Dragon_Batman> Nah I haven't just cuz it never came around to me
[3:01:30] <%Nemesis2098> I was 2 when that game was made!
[3:01:35] <%tinyswampthing> i was 5
[3:01:35] <+Andrizzleton> the good old days before 9/11
[3:01:35] <General_Terro> i have it but never played it LUL
[3:01:37] <jjetfuel> i wasnt even born then
[3:01:37] <Dragon_Batman> I tried Baldurs 1 tho
[3:01:38] <problemagic> on phones haha
[3:01:40] <%YakumoYomi> Played it when I was 16
[3:01:45] <MrDonTacos_> I don't even know what the fuck is baldur's gate
[3:01:49] <%VashyronM> It's real hard to do
[3:01:50] <%Helmed> baldurs gate 1 DID NOT AGE. its fantastic
[3:01:50] <%xeros720> i was busy playing dungeon keeper
[3:01:52] <%morcego_cinzento_arts> My first Bioware game was Dragon Age: Origins
[3:01:56] <%DensityD> hump old piss Kreygasm
[3:02:00] <problemagic> play a 100 hour game on mobile
[3:02:02] <Neo_Kaiser> Everybody got over Pats oldness
[3:02:05] <%tinyswampthing> ooooofff
[3:02:09] <+Starlight_Gamer> thaco?
[3:02:10] <%heartlesshealer> yeah, you can wreck your whole game easy as pie
[3:02:15] <RantingRavager> THAC0
[3:02:15] <Croetec> thac0 is a warcrime
[3:02:20] <fetrigon> I was hoping for simultaneous turn based.
[3:02:29] <$Daisuke89> Hey Pat, would you recommend getting Baulders Gate 1 and 2 enhanced on Switch?
[3:02:35] <%professormorrigan> BG is brilliant.
[3:02:36] <%YakumoYomi> Viconia is so tsun-tsun
[3:02:36] <Stillchr> Thaco is the greatest
[3:02:41] <problemagic> simultaneous turn based is a.legit INSANE idea
[3:02:41] <Stillchr> you shut your mouth
[3:02:48] <$floralkami> what system?
[3:02:49] <%heartlesshealer> <3
[3:02:51] <%templar010> holy fuck
[3:02:51] <%XeroSigmaPrime> Is $22.50 the lowest DOS2 has gotten USD?
[3:02:54] <Neo_Kaiser> Hopefully in Baulders Gate 3 there won't be cringe dialogue and writing.
[3:02:55] <%Valentinius_Anodyne> AD&D is a real mess, as someone who actually played that via tabletop
[3:03:04] <RantingRavager> YOU CAN MEET AND KILL DRIZZT PogChamp
[3:03:06] <SuperChumps> @fetrigon There are simulation turns for allies in multiplayer.
[3:03:13] <fetrigon> something like frozen synapse.
