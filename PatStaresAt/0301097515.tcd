[0:22:19] <+Grayhammatter> big lies
[0:22:20] <@SSaryn> Pat basically influenced Bill Gates to do a Big WIndows.
[0:22:24] <Worldbrand> Pat invented gout
[0:22:24] <%SlayrideTwinsinner> When the physical version comes out we should be getting HORNET as playable.
[0:22:29] <%hobo_knight23> Pat why are you manbearpig?
[0:22:29] <dekkitout> pat = al gore 🤔 yeah sounds legit..
[0:22:32] <MyNameIsRasus> Pat is the Dark Souls of Youtuber
[0:22:33] <fairore> KappaPride KappaPride
[0:22:39] <%catchdeezpawz> pat invented steam

[0:22:44] <deviljhojho94> Its almost 10 dollars, you are basically ripping off team cherry at that price
[0:22:44] <ArrogantPrimate> Pat wants to BECOME AS GODS
[0:22:53] <%SuperCasualBoom> Pat invented rage.
[0:22:53] <arcadeHemorrhage > And for honor is free RIGHT NOW
[0:22:55] <AirlineFood74> WTF
[0:22:59] <DapperHatwell> Become as godmaster
[0:22:59] <+seycheles> ol pat big time we calls 'im
[0:23:00] <Takyonisbackyon> Pat created the idea of lets plays
[0:23:01] <%SlayrideTwinsinner> Cause I know Hornet was a kickstarter goal and they reached it.
[0:23:03] <Worldbrand> Pat invented butternut squash
[0:23:05] <%ECRead> One day Pat will say my name right
[0:23:08] <%ECRead> one day
[0:23:10] <%wolfishfang> but they look cool on your shelves right?

[0:23:13] <TheWallOfMeat> Pat invented being wrong, we know that much.
[0:23:13] <@SSaryn> Hey man... I like my Collector's Box of FFXIV Stormblood.
[0:23:14] <TOONFOOD> No, it's because his tiny hands find it hard to unbox carboard
[0:23:15] <frozenottsel> I buy physical for steel box cases
[0:23:24] <%Sora20030c> same
[0:23:24] <Donchalant402> Remember Undertale is also a KS game
[0:23:26] <Tisaric> Hat in Time is close
[0:23:26] <MrMexicansPinataAdventure> Best game of 2017
[0:23:27] <disflipmat> PAt shit talking Shovel Knight
[0:23:28] <$magikestral> has anyone come out and said who bought the zubuzz reference @angriestpat
[0:23:29] <burna_lova> Better than Shovel Knight?
[0:23:30] <+FrostMass22> What about Mighty No. 9?
[0:23:30] <$Rafferty3231> The Long Dark is good
[0:23:30] <%Sora20030c> steel box is the best
[0:23:33] <SevenVileEyes> for honor is FREE you just have to buy 70% of the game later
[0:23:33] <danzig2> undertale too
[0:23:34] <Takyonisbackyon> !uptime

[0:23:36] <%zer0_11> Hat in Time is GREAT
[0:23:37] <DapperHatwell> Yes
[0:23:38] <%ThatGuyfromMars> probably the best unity game
[0:23:39] <Tisaric> Hollow Knight, Shovel Knight, and Hat in Time are really close
[0:23:40] <%ECRead> Hat in Time is good
[0:23:41] <xfiring> A Hat In Time isn't bad, but it's not amazing
[0:23:41] <arcaderabbit48> Yooka Layley was a good game, you all are just mean
[0:23:41] <$magikestral> shovel knight is great but this is just...MORE
[0:23:42] <arcadeHemorrhage > undertale tho
[0:23:42] <+kralec> Did he just beat it?
[0:23:42] <DapperHatwell> Better than shovel knight
[0:23:43] <MyNameIsRasus> Undertale as welp
[0:23:43] <Tisaric> oh an undertale
[0:23:46] <powerprotoman> freedom planet
[0:23:46] <%SlayrideTwinsinner> Shovel Knight is good but Hollow Knight was always more my speed.

[0:23:54] <Takyonisbackyon> Undertale no
[0:23:54] <AirlineFood74> UNERTALE 2!?
[0:23:55] <DapperHatwell> Undertale is a hard comparison because they're so different
[0:23:56] <@WoolyFish> Honey Select too.

[0:24:00] <@thenefftw> We need more of these good video games

[0:24:07] <%Sir_Gawain_Lotsson> Undertale TOO, not TWO
[0:24:10] <%umbypokochan> Shovel Knight was good but Specter Knight is REEEAALLLY good
[0:24:11] <frozenottsel> oops
[0:24:11] <Innocuous_Goat> Undertale was a kickstater game with a budget of 50k
[0:24:14] <Varanoo> LUL
[0:24:18] <+Dimfish> undertale 2 confirmed live on stream
[0:24:18] <@SSaryn> Maybe 8.
[0:24:20] <TheWallOfMeat> Remember when Pat played video games in his streams? Me neither.

[0:24:53] <+joylent_blue> can't wait for the RE6 LP Kappa
[0:24:54] <%SlayrideTwinsinner> But yeah look Hornet playable DLC should be free cause I know they don't intend to do paid. If she comes out as paid well. Shit.
[0:24:55] <burna_lova> Can someone make fan art of Pat being Short Knight and Paige being Mustard Knight? Elmo can be a propeller cat.

[0:32:49] <+universefish> not very
[0:32:50] <@SSaryn> REMEMBER WHEN SCRAPPY IN THAT 2ND SCOOBY DOO MOVIE ALSO GOT REALLY BUFF AND FOUGHT EVERYONE
[0:32:51] <flattopswag> Fappy hog
[0:32:54] <+korth367> it tells you in the main menu
[0:32:55] <%Kingkaiju0618> cheer510 hey just thought I'd let you guys know, as i saw someone mention it on a earlier stream, this hurricane is weak, and smelly. much like paiges boots. but like pat does to paige, caused some flooding in hilo on the big island. its a shit place that floods alot
[0:32:55] <CptBritches> Pat, you're about to complete the tutorial
[0:32:57] <Donchalant402> @AngriestPat start the grimm troupe since you're already here
[0:32:57] <AncelDeLambert> You're the man now, dog1
[0:33:00] <%TheImmortal70> You've explored like 30% of the base game
[0:33:03] <codussalpha> This is the wisdom of WHA
[0:33:05] <%TheImmortal70> Maybe 40%
[0:33:07] <arcadeHemorrhage > "almost done"
[0:33:08] <%Agami23> i thought that was the first scooby doo movie
[0:33:09] <@SSaryn> 3 expansions.
[0:33:10] <Donchalant402> oh nice
[0:33:12] <thisisacoolguy> They added new zones now!
[0:33:14] <frozenottsel> you need timestop to get those areas
[0:33:15] <hntronium> WHERE COULD THEY BE
[0:33:19] <DraxTD> so would you say you were in an adventure that was Bizzar, @AngriestPat ?
[0:33:20] <DapperHatwell> It's a big game
[0:33:22] <flattopswag> @SSaryn Didn't that amount to almost nothing but a stupid piss joke/scene
[0:33:24] <corepool> big game for big bois
[0:33:25] <MrMexicansPinataAdventure> This game is MASSIVE
[0:33:26] <%stigna1> Oooh! G&G!
[0:33:27] <Worldbrand> You've actually lost progress since last time
[0:33:27] <Donchalant402> that percentage is going to get lowers every time you ask pat
[0:33:28] <SatansDick1> yeye dlc time
[0:33:30] <+Grayhammatter> that's OUTRAGEOUS
[0:33:31] <@SSaryn> YES.
[0:33:32] <%iwishthiswasicq> We're at least 2% of the way through.
[0:33:32] <+korth367> missing like 2 zones
[0:33:33] <@SSaryn> IT DID.
[0:33:34] <+Enderborn18> has he done the trials yet
[0:33:34] <TOONFOOD> That's the FIRST map
[0:33:34] <MrMexicansPinataAdventure> You have 5 more zones
[0:33:35] <%NobleJedi> there's a lot of game for such a small price it's amazing
[0:33:35] <AncelDeLambert> I can count four areas myself
[0:33:35] <+FrostMass22> Scrappy Doo got really buff in the FIRST live action Scooby-Doo movie
[0:33:38] <$konekoryugamine> Made it!
[0:33:39] <Them00n> That is not true. It's more like 70%
[0:33:40] <Jontman42> I'd say like 60-70%
[0:33:44] <codussalpha> @AngriestPat I almost cant believe you STILL cant deal with spike pits
[0:33:45] <Futuretimetraveller> There are at least 3 maps you need
[0:33:46] <weizamaleza> more like 45 kind of
[0:33:46] <shinesparker198> does he have the dream nail?
[0:33:48] <SchroedingersFerret> There's a post-apocalyptic Scooby-doo comic with Scrappy as the villain.
[0:33:48] <$konekoryugamine> Now I can see what Hollow Knight is
[0:33:48] <weizamaleza> or 50
[0:33:48] <CptBritches> Pat you haven't even finished the TUTORIAL
[0:33:50] <TheWallOfMeat> Pat still hasn't hit Kingdom's Edge, right?
[0:33:50] <%Agami23> learn your scooby doo lore ssaryn
[0:33:50] <falconx9k> You're halfway through the prologue
[0:33:50] <SatansDick1> youre like 65
[0:33:51] <%stigna1> And the down. And the bits in the middle.
[0:33:52] <$GohanEgret> cant believe only 12% in
[0:33:53] <xfiring> I agree with 60%-70%
[0:33:55] <goroke> 60^
[0:33:55] <$Mendin> I count at least 5 areas unexplored
[0:33:55] <Tyhap> 60-70
[0:33:57] <%TheImmortal70> He still hasn't explored the edge of kingdom
[0:33:58] <AncelDeLambert> SHIT ton on the right
[0:33:58] <TheEdrem> still hasn't gone to deepernest

[0:34:01] <$konekoryugamine> ADORABLE.
[0:34:01] <kakdela7> just finished path of pain today, watching that is going to be something else
[0:34:01] <the_sprankton> isn't the map in this game just a filled rectangle?
[0:34:02] <Donchalant402> I have 5 zones you dont have maps for yet
[0:34:03] <MyNameIsRasus> 65%
[0:34:03] <DapperHatwell> You are FAR from completion
[0:34:04] <+MetaSla> no you still have at least 4 new areas you haven't explored
[0:34:04] <+zeiss_schreiber> Totally 40%
[0:34:06] <+Toynota10> @AngriestPat Have you played any more of Octopath?
[0:34:07] <Worldbrand> Somewhere between 1 and 80% if you ask me

[0:34:14] <IminyourBase> you've explored 1% of the game
[0:34:15] <Kghaleon> There are areas he hasn't found.
[0:34:15] <+Dimfish> its more like 50-60 counting the DLC
[0:34:17] <CptBritches> D I C KL
[0:34:17] <Varanoo> 60%

[0:40:08] <FlubbedPig> cheer200 Anime twitter's being real drama-heavy tonight, so glad there's a smooth, smoooth Hollow Knight stream to wind down the night. Also, since when does Streamlabs need to connect to my Twitch account? Fuck that, just gonna use bits.

But being mad purely because of the gender ratios of the development team just feels like low-hanging fruit.

[1:01:40] <%RazielMorias> no i dont mean that
[1:01:42] <hassanico> @arcaderabbit48 They're the ones that bragged about the ratios as if it were a positive instead of inconsequential. It's worthy of mockery at least.
[1:01:43] <haisho> ROCK ROCK ROCK
[1:01:45] <Futuretimetraveller> cheer1000 Bought bits for the first time ever just to give to you guys. I don't have much, but I just wanted to say thank you for helping to keep the black abyss of depression at bay. Much love <3

[1:01:48] <MrMexicansPinataAdventure> ROCK ROCK ROCK
[1:01:48] <TheWallOfMeat> West coast problem solving
[1:01:50] <%PipIV> I see clearly
[1:01:51] <@thenefftw> Punch the fire
[1:01:52] <+AXL808> The fire is throwing rock back!
[1:01:53] <KayThree> Yeah BC resident here it's basically all on fire
[1:01:53] <%RazielMorias> were physically throwing rocks at the smoke in the air
[1:01:55] <marylittle5657> yeah its been hazy for about a week now
[1:01:58] <+Gorgen> When i walk outside my eyes burn
[1:02:00] <$Smolkupo> West Coast is inferior coast
[1:02:00] <MrMexicansPinataAdventure> It's because of all the eucalyptus
[1:02:00] <%Sam_Tzu> it finally cleared up today
[1:02:06] <arcaderabbit48> I can't get in to Warframe for the life of me. The grinding in that game just feels absurd
[1:02:06] <%HannibalBeerus> its cause we planted all those shitty australian trees
[1:02:06] <+AXL808> because it's actually a desert region
[1:02:07] <%ECRead> IT'S ALMOST LIKE THEY SHOULD DO CONTROLLED BURNS
[1:02:07] <dekkitout> west coast; we hotboxing, boys!
[1:02:09] <Flyrant> West Coast Best Coast
[1:02:12] <marylittle5657> did pat do collector?
[1:02:14] <Psyramics> cause they planted extremely flammable eucalyptus trees everywhere
[1:02:14] <CptBritches> lmao
[1:02:15] <hassanico> woah Pat actually killed an explody bat
[1:02:15] <sturner202> dude i live in cali and i havent seen or smelled any fire lol
[1:02:19] <valachi> @arcaderabbit48 Because you act like anyone who takes issue with this tripe is some fictional strawman that exists in the dna of Elliot Rodger.
[1:02:23] <TheInkshow> It has to be purify by fire
[1:02:24] <%ECRead> Naw, that'd be silly
[1:02:29] <$correctedsun117> Peach, the air quality in Seattle is so bad, it has been compared to smoking 9 ciggarettes a day
[1:02:32] <jinkipng> have you considered putting your west coast in rice
[1:02:35] <@WoolyFish> Best Jeanist made all the panties drop.
[1:02:37] <%Fenrirlives> !uptime
[1:02:37] <@Moobot> I've been playing this game for how long? Oh only 1h 2m 39s.
[1:02:38] <valachi> It's trash and anyone who defends it is trash
[1:02:38] <nexoosen> @marylittle5657 he has nt yet done that, i dont believe he has the love key
[1:02:39] <Donchalant402> Pretty sure Cornifer is below him on the left
[1:02:42] <Donchalant402> right?
[1:02:46] <%TheImmortal70> Are the goblins depression?
[1:02:48] <Ell1ot> Fires on the west coast originate from women's berJiners
[1:02:50] <%SlayrideTwinsinner> ;w; Best Neanist
[1:02:50] <+McSoliace> the west coast is the devil's playground
[1:02:52] <$SGrim> It's almost like the dumb fuckers in SoCal imported a bunch of trees, and now the water tables in NorCal are dropping due to mass exportation of water to feed the desert community of LA. Shit's fucked. We're all gonna die.
[1:02:52] <Borkbiff > Don't go back...
[1:02:53] <%commanderclaw> Best Jeanist is SPOILERS
[1:02:55] <%ECRead> Best Jeanist best
[1:02:56] <%PipIV> As oppose to the 8 packs a day
[1:02:56] <valachi> @WoolyFish Best Jeanist isn't even that good compared to HAWK
[1:02:57] <Flyrant> best jeanist is wack AF
[1:02:59] <$konekoryugamine> Alright, I looked up the Crunchyroll anime drama shit. Turns out they announced a new show that looks kind of cute and West California artstyle and everyone has their panties in a wad over how the show is being marketed on having an all female staff, yadda yadda.
[1:03:02] <+Gorgen> Paige why did you start all those fires?
[1:03:06] <$konekoryugamine> I just say don't cast stones.
[1:03:08] <%Lion_kun> MHA characters are all hooribly underdeveloped and highly superficial
[1:03:09] <nexoosen> Im not gay, but i would go gay for best jeanist
[1:03:09] <arcaderabbit48> @valachi I'm not going to argue with you, especially here of all places. I'm not lying about what I've seen, I tried presenting my point civilly, but this isn't the place for this.
[1:03:10] <$konekoryugamine> You know?
[1:03:10] <+HyperionXV> Hello folks. raysH
[1:03:11] <%AbnormalVoid> more like Best Peanis, am I right? haha?

[1:06:31] <codussalpha> @arcaderabbit48 like, is anything NOT at least semi evil in this game? i mean, even GOD is turning people into zombies while it's trying to get free
[1:06:32] <$konekoryugamine> Only thing I'm saying on this Crunchyroll stuff is . . . it's a pointless argument. It's a CARTOON. So someone's making it, and so Crunchyroll is funding it. What;s the fucking problem? It's POINTLESS to argue about it, dude.
[1:06:33] <energywarning> guys, remember the spirals come on

[1:07:56] <arcaderabbit48> @codussalpha The truth is, he isn't mapping the world. He's creating it as he draws it on his parchment.
[1:08:02] <TheEdrem> oh no, he's up against basic platforming
[1:08:02] <Flyrant> @AngriestPat speaking of motorbikes did you see Dante can turn his into dual chansaws?

[1:37:06] <SevenVileEyes> pissed the dummy
[1:37:06] <%stigna1> @Toynota10 I know this is maddeningly unhelpful, but weird is is very much a product of confidence disparity between the weird-caller and the call-ee. Being confident in yourself, and comfortable with what you're doing (and that means being ok with things that are objectively weird; everyone is weird in their own way). ALso, don't push your weird bullshit on other people; let them live your truth and live your own, y'know?
[1:37:06] <MarylandJutsu> PAIGE ASCENDS TIME

I assume because I'm not one of the three baby daddies to her four kids! Anyways, with manager money comes the ability to pay more subs, so there's one for my other favorite red-head, who still denies his boots fetish.
[1:39:30] <AncelDeLambert> Lupus is the EXCUSE when she glitches

[1:50:05] <$SGrim> rooLick Kreygasm rooLick2
[1:50:06] <%stigna1> That's a good one out of context.
[1:50:07] <%Rostichenburg> Grimm is that hard its the nightmare king that'll wreck you
[1:50:07] <SadeEXplus> He likes it too much
[1:50:10] <alex_id> And Timestop came eventually!
[1:50:10] <marylittle5657> no theres nothing you can do with that
[1:50:12] <%Ferakin> How many times can you spank his butt in the frozen time
[1:50:28] <DivineDragoonKain> you don't need a timestop for Grimm, just get good
[1:50:31] <Zanicedg> Up.
[1:50:33] <AtlasMcCoy> I fucking HATE primal aspids
[1:50:34] <cerberuscarmine> instead of spoiling the game
[1:50:34] <energywarning> but maybe sometimes it's time stop
[1:50:36] <cerberuscarmine> TIMESTOP
[1:50:38] <iwa5h4ck3d> Timestop is the best spiler blocker
[1:50:40] <BaronVonDickButt> Stop helping him! let him suffer
[1:50:40] <+ExhaustedHealer> He found the giggle dick]
[1:50:42] <@WoolyFish> YES
[1:50:43] <+BurncoatRapscallion> The best part about the Time Stop thing in God of War is that there IS a timestop ability
[1:50:43] <+Clik404> THE SPIRAL
[1:50:44] <@WoolyFish> YES
[1:50:44] <agustorm123> you need time stop to get time stop
[1:50:45] <%redeq2> apatWrong
[1:50:47] <+AntithesisEK> primal aspids are unholy creatures
[1:50:48] <+Gorgen> YES
[1:50:49] <DesuDesuDokiDoki> you were so smug about it too

[1:50:53] <$wolfofsound> FailFish
[1:50:53] <+Answer_Moose> Grimm is a super fair boss though, considering his health scales with your nail level.
[1:50:54] <$Totally_not_toby> "what are bangs"
[1:50:54] <nexoosen> @AngriestPat BUT what if you DO need timestop!?
[1:50:54] <rosabellamelantha> @AngriestPat until you get to DMC5 and then you actually get a timestop

Closer to 5'0 the better. Bonus points if under that. The size difference is what gets me. Cause I'm 5'9 to 5'11 depending on the convenience store I'm leaving. Also tied between ponytails and twintails.

[2:23:54] <pede2011> WINION
[2:23:55] <ShawnEXE> Colosseum to upgrade nail, hornet for time stop, Grimm for YEYEYEYEY
[2:23:58] <nexoosen> @Omed250 he has not
[2:24:01] <Donchalant402> @Omed250 you cant fight the collector until you go to queen's garden
[2:24:01] <%Divryne> Lol no Grimm tonight.
[2:24:03] <+Dimfish> it'd be smarter to upgrade his nail before grimm
[2:24:05] <nexoosen> he's found the area, but not the key
[2:24:06] <+trekkie11041> @pede2011 has he got all the dreamers?
[2:24:09] <outrogabriel> quick slash or soul eater
[2:24:10] <Donchalant402> @AngriestPat steady body and quick slash
[2:24:11] <%Rostichenburg> Did Pat unlock the shortcut back to the arena?
[2:24:12] <+Dimfish> he fought grim once and got slapped within seconds
[2:24:12] <SatansDick1> !uptime
[2:24:12] <@Moobot> I've been playing this game for how long? Oh only 2h 24m 14s.

[2:24:14] <Hydrapissed> Quick focus
[2:24:15] <%craig_t> i'll catch up later, have a nice night
[2:24:20] <PettyFunk> I like quickslash and quick focus
[2:24:20] <ekkieekk> dreamshield is good for colloseum
[2:24:21] <pede2011> @trekkie11041 no, just 1
[2:24:21] <Luftraumm> nailmaster
[2:24:21] <%mister___doctor> Grimm is the fucking coolest holy shit
[2:24:24] <+Bt_Robot> TO GET THE BEST ENDING, YOU NEED TO DEFEAT NIGHTMARE ZOTE AT LEAST ONCE
[2:24:26] <nexoosen> @Rostichenburg he did but i dont think he realises it?
[2:24:29] <Luftraumm> quick focus
[2:24:29] <Donchalant402> oh I thought it was grim
[2:24:31] <Tisaric> God there's so much for him to do still, I miss having options like this
[2:24:33] <Donchalant402> nevermind
[2:24:35] <SaltBuster> Would the Winion build be good for Thunderdome?
[2:24:37] <+Gorgen> Man Zote is so cool
[2:24:54] <+Dimfish> dreamshield aint bad for when the colloseum gets all aerial on your ass
[2:24:54] <PettyFunk> But yeah, try to remember the stages of the trial!!! It's always the same order and spawn location
[2:24:58] <CptBritches> Did he unlock the path to the elevator, though?
[2:24:59] <Luftraumm> maybe winions would be good
[2:25:01] <DesuDesuDokiDoki> smrt
[2:25:03] <perryfan74> What about left answers?
[2:25:03] <nexoosen> Yes
[2:25:05] <+Dimfish> @CptBritches yes
[2:25:06] <ekkieekk> Try not to lose to zote again pat
[2:25:07] <LokimenD> the right answer is winning
[2:25:08] <@PlagueOfGripes> either that or everyone but one guy is talking out their ass
[2:25:08] <nexoosen> he did open the shortcut
[2:25:09] <CptBritches> Ok, good
[2:25:09] <ShawnEXE> I love the new DLC cause now I have so much to fucking do
[2:25:10] <%skizzuto> winions would be good but very slow
[2:25:15] <Donchalant402> @AngriestPat the fastest way it to come from the spirit glade
[2:25:16] <asbestosflavored> the right answer is git gud
[2:25:16] <sileo_patronus> Where are we going now Pat?
[2:25:17] <$konekoryugamine> @ECRead IT'S THE FUCKING BEST!
[2:25:18] <@WoolyFish> My answer is the right answer because I'm super handsome, therefore I am more right than people who aren't as handsome as me.
[2:25:20] <cerberuscarmine> plague draw hornet
[2:25:33] <%stigna1> @WoolyFish Zote, is that you?
[2:25:34] <SaltBuster> I assume pat would enjoy the method that requires the least effort
[2:25:34] <8BitDsx> paige is so quiet
[2:25:35] <ekkieekk> nah draw iselda
[2:25:41] <deviljhojho94> paige saliva
[2:25:43] <CptBritches> Plague draw Hornet on the knight on a jet ski
[2:25:44] <cerberuscarmine> plague draw zote
[2:25:45] <PettyFunk> @WoolyFish As someone who isn't very handsome, I can corroborate this
[2:25:47] <+Bt_Robot> PLEASE PAT, ITS SHIN OR NIGHTMARE ZOTE
[2:25:51] <$SGrim> Yeah, Pat is no match for the fantasies of a hormonal girl. Look at Skelmo. rooKek
[2:26:04] <Donchalant402> I mean its literally dream zote
[2:26:07] <Kghaleon> I thought he left a teleport?
[2:26:08] <$konekoryugamine> @AngriestPat Once I buy the game, I'll be sure to thank you for introducing me to it!
[2:26:08] <Donchalant402> so nightmare zote fits best
[2:26:08] <+Dimfish> wrong way for elevator
[2:26:09] <SaltBuster> Violence Zote

[2:28:36] <%stigna1> The big guys are Heavy FOols: "Warrior fighting for glory in the Colosseum of Fools. Aggressively charges down foes. Large, bulky, and fighting for its life. Don't underestimate this fighter! It can slither around quickly despite its bulk. It also has a surprisingly beautiful face beneath its mask."
[2:28:38] <CptBritches> Pat is a FOOL for thinking he can beat this
[2:28:40] <haisho> NOW THE REAL ARENA

[2:29:01] <hassanico> Arena only enemies
[2:29:01] <nexoosen> they only show up in like 2 other places
[2:29:03] <%Jpdodds> Just not these colors
[2:29:07] <californaya> I'm pretty sure this is the only place you see these
[2:29:09] <PettyFunk> They'e just armored versions of some greenpath enemies
[2:29:09] <DivineDragoonKain> PAT: Important information. When you die, go DOWN to pick up your money.
[2:29:10] <+Dimfish> Arena gets unique enemies
[2:29:11] <%stigna1> The fliers are Armoured Squits: "Hardened squit, bred for battle in the Colosseum of Fools. Tougher and more aggressive than its wild ancestor. Strong and quick! When they rear back, either move out of the way or prepare to strike back!"
[2:29:11] <californaya> unless DLC
[2:29:12] <Tisaric> I'm pretty sure every enemy is new at least in color

[2:32:19] <+Dimfish> he almost lost 4K geo lol
[2:32:19] <@Moobot> I've been playing this game for how long? Oh only 2h 32m 21s.
[2:32:19] <PettyFunk> Whew jeezers
[2:32:20] <cerberuscarmine> he would have been so mad
[2:32:24] <CptBritches> That was fucking close
[2:32:27] <haisho> I LITERALLY SAW BIG GHOST JUICE SPEWING OUT
[2:32:28] <%ArcanumMBD> Oh no I'm late to the Hollow Knight stream! How many times has Pat been murdered now?

[2:32:30] <$konekoryugamine> What are those things following you?
[2:32:35] <PettyFunk> Hey look at that inky black darkness and chime noises
[2:32:37] <BallHaul> Real men go all the way with their bad decisions, not backing out like a coward
[2:32:38] <CptBritches> Skeet skeet skeet
[2:32:38] <cerberuscarmine> also you need soul
[2:32:39] <$Mendin> the winions

[2:32:45] <arcaderabbit48> @konekoryugamine MINIONS
[2:32:45] <%kenpachi9211> death count 78
[2:32:46] <%PatNTheHat> Hey, what console is Pat playing this on?
[2:32:46] <%stigna1> @konekoryugamine They are little minions from Pat's charms.
[2:32:48] <AtlasMcCoy> @konekoryugamine Summons from charms, pretty busted
[2:32:48] <%Sirculbs> why not fill hos soul at the pool?
[2:32:55] <Flyrant> @konekoryugamine they're minions you get from a specific charm
[2:32:57] <pectusumbra> he didn't realize it didn't keep
[2:32:58] <$konekoryugamine> Those are minions?! They're so cute!
[2:32:58] <+Dimfish> @konekoryugamine its the necromancer charm build, you get a bunch of summons
[2:32:58] <deviljhojho94> BE, AGGRESSIVE, B-E-E AGGRESSIVE
[2:32:59] <$magikestral> he forgot soul, but its fine
[2:33:09] <deviljhojho94> B-E A-G-G-R-E-S-S-I-V-E
[2:33:11] <$magikestral> better than forgetting his shade lmao
[2:33:14] <dekkitout> winions already
[2:33:14] <EMP_Ike_Turner> I only like women whose left tiddy is bigger than the right tiddy
[2:33:14] <kimo313> This game looks uber comfy
[2:33:16] <+Dimfish> winnions build
[2:33:17] <%ArcanumMBD> Anyone else played Godmaster today? I got to the fourth thing but had to take a break because goddamn
[2:33:23] <+Mikatonic> so much streaming lately
[2:33:24] <CptBritches> Yeyeyeye stinky cheesy Melee player build
[2:33:27] <californaya> So you're a Summoner now?
[2:33:31] <SaltBuster> this game is comfy in the not comfy way
[2:33:32] <outrogabriel> is this build even good for the coloseum?
[2:33:37] <BakerBrute> Back to getting carried
[2:33:41] <%mattmanj17> !uptime
[2:33:41] <@Moobot> I've been playing this game for how long? Oh only 2h 33m 43s.
[2:33:43] <californaya> once the spikes come out, no, lol
[2:33:44] <nexoosen> I actually hate the poo flies, cant see anything D:
[2:33:45] <%MagickBurritoh> are they damage over time bombs?
[2:33:45] <Tisaric> this build seems really good for it, yeah
[2:33:47] <%stigna1> @outrogabriel Not really; the agility-test stuff makes minions sorta hard to operate.
[2:33:48] <+Dimfish> its a summoner build, but it might not be great for this
[2:33:48] <AtlasMcCoy> @ArcanumMBD I played a bit, but then got sidetracked trying to farm up to get the unbreakables
[2:33:48] <deviljhojho94> Its a massacre bukD
[2:33:49] <+BurncoatRapscallion> @ArcanumMBD yeah, stuck at the 3rd pantheon
[2:33:50] <Donchalant402> they form out of the GOUT
[2:33:53] <BakerBrute> Now Pat can win the game without hitting any buttons!
[2:33:55] <arcaderabbit48> tHEY DO NOTICEABLY LITTLE DAMAGE NOW
[2:34:00] <+Bt_Robot> THEY PROTEC, BUT THEY ALSO ATTEC
[2:34:02] <outrogabriel> @stigna1 i imagined
[2:34:03] <deviljhojho94> POWERFUL STRATS
[2:34:04] <Flyrant> this build is ok, but if you need to heal often the kamikaze flies will drain your soul
[2:34:07] <ty2000sk> IM DOING THE FLOWER CHALLENGE KILL ME
[2:34:07] <$konekoryugamine> So did Elmo really poop in the bathtub, or did he just not do it?
[2:34:10] <%ArcanumMBD> @outrogabriel weaverlings are going to be useless for a lot of this fight, but the poo bugs will be helpful
[2:34:29] <PettyFunk> I never really considered using a minion build for this. I just panicked until it worked
[2:34:40] <%stigna1> @blackpeople9111 Hullo.
[2:34:41] <aeonicvector> @Flyrant its good for people who are great at dodging but terrible and timing a heal
[2:34:42] <nexoosen> Aye, im less a fan of this build in late, the quickslash combos i feel are better
[2:34:45] <@PlagueOfGripes> of all things your body makes, shit would probably be the thing most likely to betray you
[2:34:46] <deviljhojho94> PogChamp
[2:34:47] <%commanderclaw> apatCrazy apatCrazy
[2:34:49] <Donchalant402> thats that GOOD shit
[2:34:50] <%ECRead> @konekoryugamine right? I often find myself humming "What Shall We Do Now?" when I'm bored at work
[2:34:50] <SaltBuster> I think dashmaster might be better than Poo, since it makes the spiders move and jump more.
[2:34:51] <Luftraumm> not seeing things is gonna be a problem further along
[2:34:51] <Donchalant402> literally
[2:34:58] <SatansDick1> so many explosioins
[2:34:58] <perryfan74> This build is shit
[2:34:59] <mtgtin> Oh my god
[2:35:00] <ekkieekk> @ty2000sk if you clear out the enemies ahead of time it's much easier, also give the flower to the old man in dirtmouth
[2:35:03] <+Gorgen> shit on them
[2:35:04] <$konekoryugamine> @ECRead Finally someone else gets it!!

[2:35:15] <Tisaric> fuck you
[2:35:16] <%ArcanumMBD> @BurncoatRapscallion that third one gave me a lot of trouble too. Had to switch to Quick Focus so I could lame out some fights with heals

[2:36:14] <%stigna1> The units are Great Hoppers: Hardened squit, bred for battle in the Colosseum of Fools. Tougher and more aggressive than its wild ancestor. Strong and quick! When they rear back, either move out of the way or prepare to strike back!
[2:36:15] <%SuperCasualBoom> *lean back gangsta style* shhhhiiittttt....
[2:36:18] <%stigna1> Ooops!
[2:36:20] <DesuDesuDokiDoki> YEYEYE
[2:36:21] <%stigna1> Leaps around the edge of the world, trying to crush their prey beneath its body. A worthy foe, surprisingly nimble for its size. Either keep your distance, or try to dance between its hops and strike at its legs.

[2:38:56] <%stigna1> That is called a Battle Obble: "Raised in the Colosseum. Although trained for combat, its movements and attacks are still haphazard. They have crafted a tiny mask for it! Is such an extravagance practical I wonder?"
[2:38:59] <$konekoryugamine> No, he has a wummy tummy ache
[2:39:01] <$konekoryugamine> XD
[2:39:02] <@PlagueOfGripes> just put a 5 gallon bucket under pat's part of the couch

[2:39:05] <nexoosen> Remember that time pat was so full of shit that it became a problem and medical professionals had to step in?
[2:39:07] <%PatNTheHat> Gaze ye not into the poop, lest the poop gaze back into you
[2:39:13] <@WoolyFish> This arena is what the inside of Paige's burgers looks like.
[2:39:16] <Worldbrand> It's still based on kills, but you dont gotta kill all of em
[2:39:16] <PettyFunk> Mix of death+time I think
[2:39:24] <%Rostichenburg> Good job beating Rangda Bangda
[2:39:26] <Flyrant> no it isn't time, it just changes after you kill a certain number
[2:39:31] <Donchalant402> ALMOST DONE

[2:42:24] <TEALyOS> the last trial is SUPER FUN
[2:42:24] <%mister___doctor> Watch him fucking destroy it
[2:42:24] <resstarr> Its the toughest thing before rhe DLC
[2:42:26] <ShawnEXE> It's not impossible and it's not the toughest thing in the game
[2:42:27] <leole11> UPGRADE YOUR NAIL
[2:42:27] <LORDSPOOKLEKINS> It's like a half hour
[2:42:29] <dekkitout> did excalibur set this shit up too?
[2:42:30] <%Divryne> Go fight Hornet.
[2:42:30] <$rdark_ksu> hornet fight now?
[2:42:30] <+Cervarian> Toughest thing in th egame... before today that is danLUL
[2:42:34] <pede2011> SECOND HARDEST. NEW DLC IS HARDER
[2:42:34] <aeonicvector> WAS the toughest thing in the game
[2:42:35] <+JustToWatch> not even fucking close to the toughest thing in the game
[2:42:35] <+Answer_Moose> The last trial is also pointless! You only get money!
[2:42:35] <+Kawaso> DOO itt
[2:42:36] <themagic_conch> time for pat to beat it first try
[2:42:36] <Worldbrand> that's what she... hm...
[2:42:37] <$konekoryugamine> Be smart about this, Pat.
[2:42:37] <Hydrapissed> IGGY!!!
[2:42:38] <+BurncoatRapscallion> It used to be the toughest gauntlet, but it's way easy compared to Godmaster
[2:42:41] <SatansDick1> go upgrade then fight hornet
[2:42:42] <Prism_Wing> WHY THE FUCK did they enter into a Colosseum death tournament then?!
[2:42:44] <+Valison> If only you could get rid of your dirty poops in real life
[2:42:45] <TheMrTwisted> BIG NAIL!
[2:42:45] <resstarr> LET PAT PLAY AT THE GOLDEN SAUCER
[2:42:45] <Donchalant402> @AngriestPat do you have enough pale ore to upgrade your nail?
[2:42:45] <%Divryne> Blue balled by Hornet fight.
[2:42:46] <PettyFunk> I'd say Nightmare King may be more technically demanding but jesus this one is a fucking slog
[2:42:49] <%Rostichenburg> Nightmare King is way harder
[2:42:49] <%ArcanumMBD> @Cervarian before Grimm Troupe you mean. NKG is horrendous
[2:42:50] <Aixenn> Trial of the Fool is 100% the hardest thing in this game. i still havent beat it. i basically gave up on trying at this point
[2:42:52] <+Dimfish> it was one of the tougher things in the ORIGINAL builld of the game
[2:42:53] <nexoosen> yes
[2:42:54] <+Dimfish> not anymore
[2:43:01] <fazoburquina> @AngriestPat you can def do the 3rd trial but it is reccomended you max out your Nail first
[2:43:02] <$Tredecian> still prretty har though
[2:43:02] <SaltBuster> Poop is over
[2:43:03] <Donchalant402> final upgrade is 4k
[2:43:04] <+Kuro_Koshka> Fool was super easy are you high
[2:43:08] <ekkieekk> upgrade then grimm
[2:43:09] <+Dimfish> still tough tho
[2:43:13] <Kghaleon> The arena is above the kingdom's edge, hence where all the bodies are falling from.
[2:43:14] <+Kuro_Koshka> NKG and "R" are WAY harder than Fool
[2:43:15] <+Bt_Robot> SOON PAT WILL BECOME GIANT!
[2:43:15] <PettyFunk> Wait does he have three?
[2:43:16] <BakerBrute> Time for Pat to cheese it and learn nothing about clean execution of awesome combat
[2:43:19] <Donchalant402> yeah
[2:43:22] <%skizzuto> yeah
[2:43:22] <%Rostichenburg> Trial of the Fool is just long it's not super hard
[2:43:23] <Donchalant402> it is
[2:43:27] <Donchalant402> kings
[2:43:27] <resstarr> King's station is faster
[2:43:27] <+Dimfish> upgrade then FOOL
[2:43:28] <SaltBuster> Well, either way he should upgrade his nail first before anything
[2:43:30] <Flyrant> if you run Soul Eater + Shaman stone + Spell twister it's actually pretty easy to beat the last arena
[2:43:32] <+Kuro_Koshka> Not to mention Hyper Zote and Hyper Dung Boi
[2:43:34] <%stigna1> @Aixenn Swap up your build a bit; it should be pretty easy with some practice. I did it before double jumps.
[2:43:36] <%ECRead> @konekoryugamine honestly, I had "The Trial" stuck in my head for days after first watching it
[2:43:36] <+Cervarian> @ArcanumMBD NKG is simply about execution. He does Move A, you respond the same way. Fool trial is... exhausting.
[2:43:41] <outrogabriel> kings, just superdash trough
[2:43:42] <+Answer_Moose> @ekkieekk Upgrade then grimm? What? He needs to see if he can even beat hornet yet.
[2:43:46] <+Dimfish> kings because you can just super dash there
[2:43:48] <nexoosen> After you upgrade you can go anywhere, bar like 2 timestop walls
[2:43:51] <Aixenn> @stigna1 nawwwwww im good
[2:44:02] <%ArcanumMBD> flawless
[2:44:02] <leole11> Grimm is super late game, and chat wants pat to waste hours on her
[2:44:05] <ekkieekk> he said he wanted to do Grimm before hornet
[2:44:06] <%stigna1> @Aixenn Fair enough! Live your truth. ^_^
[2:44:07] <nexoosen> you can follow your dreans
[2:44:17] <Kghaleon> Is he missing one health upgrade?
[2:44:18] <PettyFunk> Are you all ready for Pat to make the wrong choice shortly?
[2:44:20] <$Mendin> Grimm1 is doable with the upgraded nail
[2:44:26] <$magikestral> hornet gives access to timestop, I'd recommend her first
[2:44:28] <+Kuro_Koshka> Fool took 2 tries because I underestimated the boss but it's still way easy and takes 5-10 mins
[2:44:28] <$Mendin> @PettyFunk Oh of course
[2:44:29] <@thenefftw> I've got a busy day tomorrow, so I'm ducking out here
[2:44:30] <devanmuse> wasn't this area covered in orange biocurse juice? ... Yeah, I'm super out of the loop here
[2:44:31] <Flyrant> man I hope pat doesn't make the wrong choice
[2:44:39] <%stigna1> @thenefftw Peace.

[2:44:45] <outrogabriel> 200, 450, 800
[2:44:45] <%Rostichenburg> Regular Grimm should be pretty doable
[2:44:45] <$shadow1man9> 200, 450, 800
[2:44:45] <%skizzuto> 200, 450, and 800 i think
[2:44:45] <AtlasMcCoy> They're worth some amount of geo
[2:44:47] <Aixenn> they are worth quite a bit
[2:44:47] <deviljhojho94> Bunches
[2:44:47] <+Kuro_Koshka> NKG doesn't give you time to heal hardly ever and does 2 damage a hit
[2:44:47] <$konekoryugamine> @ECRead Good morning, Worm, your honor! The crown will plainly show who now stands before you was caught red-handed showing FEELINGS.
[2:44:49] <+Answer_Moose> There's no downside
[2:44:49] <$magikestral> 200, 350, 800

[2:44:49] <@thenefftw> !uptime
[2:44:49] <@Moobot> I've been playing this game for how long? Oh only 2h 44m 51s.
[2:44:50] <+Dimfish> kings idols 800 a piece
[2:44:50] <californaya> They're there just to sell
[2:44:51] <leole11> 200, 450, 800
[2:44:55] <%umbypokochan> save them for when you need 15,000
[2:44:55] <Flyrant> sell them
[2:44:58] <+FrostMass22> It looks good but I hate that Melissa McCarthy is in it
[2:44:59] <CptBritches> You might as well sell them since youre in the area
[2:45:00] <%TheImmortal70> @angriestpat enough to get you that unbreakable charm
[2:45:04] <DivineDragoonKain> don't use too many, you want some on hand in case you lose all your cash
[2:45:08] <+Gorgen> If only you had a bank
[2:45:11] <CptBritches> the only reason they exist is to sell
[2:45:12] <californaya> Hollow Maths
[2:45:12] <Flyrant> nah farm the arena for 15000
[2:45:12] <+Dimfish> you might wwant to save those for later pat
[2:45:15] <%Divryne> You have enough Geo to upgrade.
[2:45:15] <+Dimfish> honestyl
[2:45:16] <nexoosen> I'd save em for now until theres something you need @AngriestPat
[2:45:18] <Worldbrand> You should have over 15000
[2:45:20] <%skizzuto> you need 4k to upgrade nail tho
[2:45:22] <%Agami23> i just realized that the nail arts are zelda colored
[2:45:23] <+Dimfish> you have enough geo to upgrade
[2:45:24] <+Rose_Inko> Welcome to the Calvin Klein commercial zone
[2:45:24] <Worldbrand> oh
[2:45:24] <Kghaleon> Final nail is only 4K, you have enough.
[2:45:24] <leole11> he wants to see if he has 15000 for unbreakable
[2:45:25] <Zanicedg> Don't sell yet.
[2:45:31] <Worldbrand> yeah the nail is more important
[2:45:31] <sangi53> KEEP THEM TILL YOU NEED EM
[2:45:32] <+Kawaso> @kghaleon he'd have to finish the flower quest and beat a difficult dlc quest to mad that out.
[2:45:33] <%ArcanumMBD> so does pat know about getting locked out of ending A?
[2:45:34] <$magikestral> @angriestpat arena is great to getting money, but you should upgrade first
[2:45:36] <PettyFunk> Don't sell them unless you need the geo immediately, these are essentially your REAL bank
[2:45:41] <AtlasMcCoy> Should get greed first pat
[2:45:43] <nexoosen> he does not have enough for 15k
[2:45:44] <%Rostichenburg> Need those Arcane Eggs
[2:45:50] <Donchalant402> @AngriestPat I'd reccommend you unlock the godmaster area since you're in the zone, going through it leaves you out by a shortcut next to the smith's house
[2:45:50] <%Divryne> Pat you have enough already.
[2:45:51] <%ArcanumMBD> cause with chat wanting him to go fight Hornet, that's getting more possible
[2:45:53] <%ECRead> @konekoryugamine Showing feelings of an almost HUMAN nature! This will not do
[2:45:53] <%TheImmortal70> Are you kidding he DEFINITELY has enough
[2:45:54] <Flyrant> just farm arena if you need 15000 for unbreakable
[2:45:56] <CptBritches> MATH STREAM BOYS
[2:45:57] <%TheImmortal70> He already has 7800 geo
[2:46:00] <Worldbrand> Yeah prioritize the nail
[2:46:04] <%TheImmortal70> Sorry, 7900 geo
[2:46:05] <$konekoryugamine> @ECRead CALL IN THE SCHOOL MASTER!
[2:46:07] <jojojackxd> @AngriestPat What do you think of the new RE2 remake?
[2:46:16] <%Divryne> LUL
[2:46:25] <Donchalant402> @AngriestPat Godmaster is by the Flukemarm's room
[2:46:25] <Intolerable> !uptime
[2:46:26] <@Moobot> I've been playing this game for how long? Oh only 2h 46m 27s.
[2:46:26] <pede2011> @AngriestPat PAT, WHATEVER YOU DO, DONT DO WHAT HE ASKS
[2:46:27] <Kghaleon> Someone should tell him to take the Godmaster path
[2:46:28] <$Tredecian> @AngriestPat fragile upgrades are 9000/12000 and 15000
[2:46:29] <$konekoryugamine> DID YOU SEE HOW COOL BERKIN LOOKS NOW?!
[2:46:31] <@WoolyFish> I love that the remake looks actually spooky.
[2:46:34] <%ECRead> @konekoryugamine aaaaaaah it's great
[2:46:40] <%Agami23> weird how the birkin stuff they showed didnt have music at all
[2:46:47] <Flyrant> Claire's face is the stuff of nightmares
[2:46:48] <devanmuse> @AngriestPat Did you see the Gamescom Birkin fight footage? Thoughts?
[2:46:50] <$konekoryugamine> No that;s awesome!
[2:46:52] <Luftraumm> yeah don't do it
[2:46:54] <%TheImmortal70> Fuckin Claire is just Zoe from L4D
[2:46:56] <+GuelermeDias> look, it's horrendous holllow shells and a cute bug knight, also the enemies of this game
[2:46:57] <SatansDick1> i think its cooler without music
[2:46:58] <+Bt_Robot> KINGOMS EDGE MOSQUITO RUN NETS 500 EACH WAY
[2:46:59] <@WoolyFish> Music isn't high on the priority list.
[2:47:00] <Luftraumm> don't do the thing
[2:47:00] <Varanoo> Remember to >>NOT KILL<<
[2:47:02] <%TheImmortal70> Like they really messed up the design
[2:47:02] <%Rostichenburg> Disappointed at Claire's new costume
[2:47:03] <PettyFunk> Time for mistakes
[2:47:05] <Donchalant402> DONT KILL HIM

[2:47:18] <Donchalant402> YES
[2:47:20] <%TheImmortal70> @angriestpat Now THINK REALLY CAREFULLY about what comes next
[2:47:20] <deviljhojho94> DO IT
[2:47:21] <%Fenrirlives> @AngriestPat thoughts one the disposable arms in DMCV?
[2:47:22] <DivineDragoonKain> do it

[2:47:22] <+Dimfish> what do you mean nah
[2:47:23] <deviljhojho94> FUCK YOU PAT
[2:47:23] <DivineDragoonKain> DO IT
[2:47:24] <Donchalant402> CLICK YES
[2:47:24] <%edwardskacz> well upgrade first
[2:47:28] <dekkitout> or you know, she's just got the munchies...
[2:47:29] <+GuelermeDias> gib
[2:47:29] <outrogabriel> dont kill him

[2:47:34] <$ookiiapple> @AngriestPat you can reforge my nail anytime
[2:47:35] <PumaOfDarkness> THE SPAWN is hungry
[2:47:35] <oAznoUta> here we go
[2:47:36] <$konekoryugamine> Do it. Do it you coward.
[2:47:38] <$rdark_ksu> I mean it literally cant hurt yeat?
[2:47:39] <Luftraumm> upgrade and then don't do it
[2:47:40] <+BurncoatRapscallion> [R1]
[2:47:42] <$Tredecian> uprgrade then choise
[2:47:42] <$konekoryugamine> THAT'S COOL
[2:47:43] <%Rostichenburg> Hey let Pat make his own decision
[2:47:44] <Varanoo> Remember to >>NOT KILL<< for the love of god
[2:47:45] <matteh03> If you put 2550 of geo or more in the bank, the NPC disappears with your money and you have to go and retrieve it in one of the houses in the city of tears, near the king's station. It will give you an extra 2500 of geo.
[2:47:48] <jojojackxd> Cool ass looking bug
[2:47:48] <+Kawaso> do it
[2:47:49] <+GuelermeDias> paige smoked some prime weed
[2:47:51] <Flyrant> oh it is the last one
[2:47:52] <+Toynota10> @AngriestPat Paige, if you've been working out, you're metabolism go up, so you need more food to give you energy. Get that protein girl!
[2:47:52] <AtlasMcCoy> DONT DO IT
[2:47:54] <SaltBuster> Do Not Death
[2:47:54] <+Answer_Moose> DO NOT KILL HIM
[2:47:55] <+GuelermeDias> now he wants food
[2:47:56] <Donchalant402> DONT DO IT
[2:47:56] <Varanoo> >>NOT KILL<<
[2:47:57] <%edwardskacz> Don't do it

[2:53:31] <SaltBuster> She's gregarent with the lupus.
[2:53:32] <SatansDick1> !uptime
[2:53:33] <@Moobot> I've been playing this game for how long? Oh only 2h 53m 34s.
[2:53:35] <EMP_Ike_Turner> SourPls
[2:53:36] <+Hamblasto> Paige can't be pregnant. She'd punch herself
[2:53:44] <PumaOfDarkness> dxsseeeee
[2:53:49] <%Urgotfantasy> maybe paige shoulda eaten that croissant
[2:53:50] <%Piemen99> PREGENET WITH SECOND ELMO
[2:53:56] <PumaOfDarkness> Whoops. Cat walked over the keybaord.
[2:54:09] <%Urgotfantasy> apatDab
[2:54:14] <%Piemen99> apatDab apatDab
[2:54:14] <+Gorgen> just watch as Paige gives birth to kittens and pat is pissed
[2:54:14] <+Rose_Inko> PREGANANANT
[2:54:19] <+Hamblasto> Unless she's pregnant with bees. Punching them would probably just make them mad
[2:54:29] <%Kahnicus> Relaxing tunes...
[2:54:30] <%Urgotfantasy> the bees reside inside
[2:54:31] <$magikestral> @gorgen that's her son you gross son of a-
[2:54:36] <%Remery_> paige lays eggs
[2:54:51] <%Urgotfantasy> with her ovipositor
[2:54:52] <SatansDick1> is paige pregnant with shadow elmo aka omle
[2:55:04] <+MechaBaphomet> Did the bees impregnate her?
[2:55:05] <$ookiiapple> sp00nD sp00nD sp00nD sp00nD sp00nD sp00nD sp00nD sp00nD
[2:55:15] <AncelDeLambert> Scrooge gave Paige another sandwich
[2:55:22] <SatansDick1> is paige gonna give birth to a second pat
[2:55:38] <%Urgotfantasy> apatDab
[2:55:39] <ty2000sk> the hollow knight flower puzzle is the worst
[2:55:42] <SatansDick1> will pat and new pat have to fight for her honor
[2:55:43] <$SGrim> Imagine how Pat would feel if Paige was pregnant with Bees. I bet that would... sting. tpRWBYyang
[2:55:52] <+Answer_Moose> ...
[2:55:54] <+Answer_Moose> really
[2:55:55] <ekkieekk> flower quest isnt that hard
[2:55:55] <+xXCrustybunsXx> Paige is preganant with mustard baby
[2:56:01] <leole11> @SGrim That would bee awful
[2:56:03] <+Hamblasto> He could hit the back and squish all the bees
[2:56:04] <%umbypokochan> i did flower quest first try
[2:56:06] <Futuretimetraveller> Path of Pain is the worst
[2:56:09] <ekkieekk> just never sit on a bench
[2:56:13] <SatansDick1> she is gregnant with negapat
[2:56:15] <ekkieekk> path of pain is the worst
[2:56:17] <zal_silverfang> so. to change the subject. after pat finishes Hollow Knight, what do you all wanna have him do next? what is next on the list past warframe content
[2:56:23] <+Gorgen> She will give birth to Ronald McDonald
[2:56:29] <leole11> Hollow Knight Iron Sould
[2:56:33] <leole11> (not really)
[2:56:35] <SatansDick1> @zal_silverfang claire B
[2:56:36] <Flyrant> Path of Pain was my favorite part of the game tbh
[2:56:40] <+Hamblasto> She could squeeze out a skeleton
[2:56:41] <+Answer_Moose> @zal_silverfang I want to see RE 6
[2:56:42] <%Kahnicus> Pat should finish ultramodded RE2
[2:56:42] <ekkieekk> Hollow Knight All Stream Every Dtream
[2:56:43] <+GuelermeDias> paige got DOWN WITH THE SICKNESS
[2:56:49] <turf_wind_and_fire> There’s a sick part of me that wants him to play we happy few
[2:56:52] <+Menace109> I'm always wondering what these fuckin lyrics are
[2:56:54] <$SGrim> @Answer_Moose thank you. That response made me laugh heartily.
[2:57:10] <leole11> "I'm a shapeshifter, In this mascarade"
[2:57:11] <leole11> I think
[2:57:16] <%umbypokochan> i just want Paige to play Detroit
[2:57:18] <%stigna1> @turf_wind_and_fire Yeah, what's the deal with that game I heard good things about it a while back and now its, what, buggy?
[2:57:21] <Flyrant> at Poe's mascarade
[2:57:22] <%Kahnicus> masquerade
[2:57:23] <+korth367> wtf is with the music
[2:57:25] <SatansDick1> Just look up the lyrics
[2:57:27] <leole11> sorry, Poe
[2:57:30] <+sparkletone> the lyrics are about being a crime teen in persona 5
[2:57:32] <jacknerik> pat where r u
[2:57:34] <BaronVonDickButt> Watch the day Paige is actually Pregnant and NO ONE believes her.
[2:57:36] <$ookiiapple> im pretty sure theyre dead
[2:57:42] <nexoosen> Honestly Im down for anything, more here for pat and paige than any particular game
[2:57:42] <%Divryne> Pat slipped and died.
[2:57:43] <%Remery_> All women are Queens...
[2:57:46] <+Menace109> is pat secretly a shapeshifter?
[2:57:48] <+Tylermcd93> Theyre doing it
[2:57:48] <%Divryne> apatDab
[2:57:50] <Ell1ot> Pat is making a baby with Paige now
[2:57:52] <SatansDick1> paige ate pat like a pregnant mantis
[2:57:52] <SaltBuster> The music is persona 5 music. It's pretty good dude
[2:57:58] <+Answer_Moose> @Menace109 "I'm a shapeshifter" "Chained down to my core" is the second line I think
[2:58:02] <%Kahnicus> hiding both face and mind...
[2:58:04] <+Gorgen> Im suprised Pat has lasted this long
[2:58:04] <$magikestral> @stigna1 it was always buggy, but it tried to both do the bioshock thing and the survival thing. didn't work out
[2:58:05] <+Puppet88> surprise make outs?
[2:58:08] <Flyrant> P5 Kreygasm
[2:58:10] <+GuelermeDias> paige can't get preggo, she cannot self-terminate
[2:58:12] <BaronVonDickButt> Dick that Suchi down HARD!
[2:58:13] <$ookiiapple> i heard a fat'
[2:58:18] <$ookiiapple> hes back'
[2:58:19] <+korth367> is the music not slowed down for anyone else?
[2:58:21] <turf_wind_and_fire> @stigna1 so apparently the concept is there but it is buggy as fuck. I’ve seen some clips and play throughs and for a full price game it’s really bad.
[2:58:21] <+Story_Ark> IM A SHAFE SHIFTER
[2:58:23] <sileo_patronus> @Remery_ If she breathes, she's a THOOOOOT
[2:58:26] <%stigna1> Hmm, shame.
[2:58:30] <SatansDick1> is paiges stand just a baby
[2:58:31] <oAznoUta> gotta shower. nobody do anything cool for the next 15 minutes or so
[2:58:34] <pede2011> The fact that Pat is probably getting his sucked right now troubles me

[3:02:41] <SatansDick1> hornet
[3:02:41] <%stigna1> @Flyrant Yep! Different than mammals, but they do.
[3:02:42] <CptBritches> Grimmmm
[3:02:42] <Flyrant> Grimm
[3:02:42] <Zanicedg> Hornet!
[3:02:43] <%Sirculbs> Get time stop
[3:02:43] <@WoolyFish> @Flyrant Yes, they have 2 genders, just like humans.
[3:02:43] <custoadian> Grimm, then Hornet?
[3:02:44] <deviljhojho94> does the pope shit on children? Of course bugs have genders
[3:02:44] <%Piemen99> GRIM
[3:02:45] <Borealum_EX> @AngriestPat just use the dream gate you cheap fuck
[3:02:45] <ekkieekk> GRIMM
[3:02:45] <+Bt_Robot> hornt!
[3:02:46] <Donchalant402> HORNET YEAH
[3:02:46] <$shadow1man9> Hornet
[3:02:46] <DivineDragoonKain> fight grimm or hornet
[3:02:47] <+JustToWatch> HORNET
[3:02:48] <AtlasMcCoy> Either grimm or hornet or you can get a timestop in an area you dont even KNOW about
[3:02:48] <DivineDragoonKain> your call
[3:02:49] <SaltBuster> hornet or grimm
[3:02:49] <%ArcanumMBD> @AngriestPat there's an achievement for killing him too. But now you cant get it unless you make a new game. Or if you had backed up your save. Same with Zote in the colosseum or leaving him to die
[3:02:50] <leole11> Hornet
[3:02:50] <%Piemen99> DO THE GRIM
[3:02:54] <+xXCrustybunsXx> HORNET
[3:02:55] <SaltBuster> Grimm Hornet
[3:02:56] <Varanoo> grim
[3:02:57] <Flyrant> interesting, thanks guys
[3:03:00] <DesuDesuDokiDoki> pattys crew~
[3:03:03] <pectusumbra> alright, time for me to call it a night. will catch the rest tomorrow. good night all
[3:03:04] <+Dimfish> FOOLS
[3:03:04] <Varanoo> Grimm
[3:03:06] <Theoyveyman> HORNET, TIME STOP, THEN GRIMM
[3:03:06] <+Dimfish> or hornet
[3:03:07] <BaronVonDickButt> Horny Grim
[3:03:08] <ekkieekk> lets go grimm
[3:03:08] <$Tredecian> in deepnest
[3:03:11] <%umbypokochan> no, when you meet him
[3:03:11] <%ArcanumMBD> @AngriestPat leaving him to die early in the game
[3:03:11] <nexoosen> first zote encounter
[3:03:13] <SaltBuster> So... is essence finite in this game?
[3:03:13] <nexoosen> with the fly
[3:03:14] <%Piemen99> GRIM
[3:03:15] <Flyrant> deepnest
[3:03:17] <$konekoryugamine> Wait, you can leave Zote to die?
[3:03:17] <%Piemen99> FUCK THE GRIM
[3:03:18] <sileo_patronus> First encounter
[3:03:23] <gimmickypizza> Pat was right Wesker teleports
[3:03:23] <Donchalant402> its best to fight grimm once you get the timestop you can get after hornet
[3:03:24] <californaya> no, you leave him to die in the very first thing
[3:03:25] <+BurncoatRapscallion> God now I need to see if a Grimm Troupe Hornet art exists
[3:03:25] <+Omed250> You leave him to die while he gets attacked in greenpath
[3:03:27] <+Dimfish> @konekoryugamine yeah
[3:03:28] <Borealum_EX> hornet time stop is the good shit
[3:03:30] <ekkieekk> if you leave him to die he doesnt cuck you
[3:03:30] <%Agami23> you can get essence from killing generic enemies
[3:03:30] <+Answer_Moose> @AngriestPat check the tents with your fragiles equipped
[3:03:31] <+Dimfish> or in deepnest
[3:03:31] <%Piemen99> FIGHT THE GRIM
[3:03:32] <%stigna1> @SaltBuster No, it drops off foes a little bit. More drops to replenish dreamgate uses.
[3:03:34] <+Bt_Robot> You never save him from the mosquito boss
[3:03:36] <Eresus> @SaltBuster no, enemies drop essence from time to time
[3:03:36] <AncelDeLambert> You just kill him
[3:03:39] <%ArcanumMBD> @konekoryugamine yeah either to the big bug above greenpath, or in deepenest
[3:03:40] <%Piemen99> FIGHT HIIIIIMMM
[3:03:42] <%TaifuDragon> This soundtrack reminds me a lot of Nausicaa of the Valley of the Wind
[3:03:42] <+Dimfish> no greenpath or deepnest, not colloseum
[3:03:43] <$konekoryugamine> Oh wow I am not sure how to feel about that . . .
[3:03:45] <ekkieekk> GRIMM
[3:03:46] <%TaifuDragon> Anyone else get that vibe?
[3:03:52] <$konekoryugamine> Mean, he's a piece alright, but not that much of a piece.
[3:03:53] <AtlasMcCoy> @konekoryugamine Yea there are a few HARD choices in the game, like leaving zote to die, which locks you out of anything to do with him, not really worth it except for an achievement
[3:03:54] <SaltBuster> Oh. I thought you only got it off ghosts and trees.
[3:03:55] <cerberuscarmine> zote the man with the plan
[3:03:56] <%Piemen99> GRIM GRIM GRIM GRIM GRIM GRIM
[3:03:57] <nexoosen> go nausica was the shit
[3:03:59] <+Dimfish> @TaifuDragon almost yeah
[3:03:59] <PettyFunk> I'd say go do Fog Canyon
[3:04:02] <%ArcanumMBD> Did pat listen to all of Zote's precepts?
[3:04:04] <%Piemen99> GRIM UOU COWARD
[3:04:08] <SaltBuster> And there's only so many ghosts in here.
[3:04:08] <PettyFunk> Or at least, the Mound
[3:04:13] <%Piemen99> aw
[3:04:14] <$konekoryugamine> @AtlasMcCoy I'm all for helping him if it locks out content, thank you.
[3:04:15] <$SGrim> @ArcanumMBD no
[3:04:16] <+Dimfish> @ArcanumMBD he said theres no way hes going to do that
[3:04:16] <Flyrant> if you leave zote to die are you cut off from the boss you get at the end of his quest line?
[3:04:16] <%Piemen99> why no grom
[3:04:20] <%Piemen99> grim*
[3:04:21] <%Rostichenburg> It took me ages to get Zote out of the arena because I somehow did the first round before he got there
[3:04:22] <%TheImmortal70> Yes
[3:04:23] <+xXCrustybunsXx> Yaaaaaaaay hornet
[3:04:26] <+CrystalLakeWasJusASetback> Does Zote ever realize he's just a weak loserbug?
[3:04:26] <SatansDick1> if he cant beat hornet he cant beat grimm
[3:04:27] <BaronVonDickButt> Never Grim you punks
[3:04:27] <cerberuscarmine> SHA
[3:04:28] <%TheImmortal70> You can't kill zote yourself if you leave him to die
[3:04:33] <leole11> Becauase hornet gives time stop
[3:04:33] <%ArcanumMBD> @SGrim @Dimfish this is the worst timeline
[3:04:36] <%Sirculbs> Does he have all the Stag stations now?
[3:04:37] <$konekoryugamine> @AtlasMcCoy Sorry, let me rephrase that: I'm all for helping him if killing him locks out content.
[3:04:39] <$konekoryugamine> Sorry
[3:04:40] <%Kahnicus> Is the transport a rhino beetle?
[3:04:44] <%stigna1> @Sirculbs Nope
[3:04:47] <ekkieekk> grimm gives something cool too tho
[3:04:47] <PettyFunk> Stag
[3:04:48] <+Omed250> Stag Carrier is the real GOAT
[3:04:48] <AtlasMcCoy> It's a stag beetle
[3:04:49] <%TheImmortal70> He is not even CLOSE to having all stations
[3:04:49] <Donchalant402> @Sirculbs he still havent got to queen's garden
[3:04:51] <SaltBuster> It's a stag beetle
[3:04:52] <nexoosen> @Sirculbs nope, he's missing 2 i think
[3:04:55] <$SGrim> @ArcanumMBD Baddest, not worst.
[3:05:00] <+Dimfish> @CrystalLakeWasJusASetback not really? but bretta does eventually realize hes kind of a dink
[3:05:00] <@WoolyFish> Hornet before trail of the fool seems like a good choice.
[3:05:01] <%Rostichenburg> No I don't think Pat's been to the gardens yet
[3:05:01] <%Sir_Gawain_Lotsson> Holy shit Pat is STILL streaming?
[3:05:04] <Donchalant402> @nexoosen just queens
[3:05:07] <PettyFunk> He's also missing a big power
[3:05:11] <+Dimfish> bretta jumps from fling to fling
[3:05:14] <cerberuscarmine> !uptime
[3:05:14] <@Moobot> I've been playing this game for how long? Oh only 3h 5m 16s.
[3:05:16] <%ArcanumMBD> @SGrim but how can Pat possibly hope to beat the game without learning all of Zote's precepts?
[3:05:20] <leole11> NAIL STRONK
[3:05:20] <+xXCrustybunsXx> Big damage
[3:05:24] <ekkieekk> oh yeah, pay attention to these bodies
[3:05:24] <Flyrant> it's slightly stronger
[3:05:24] <cerberuscarmine> ikr
[3:05:25] <AtlasMcCoy> I still cant believe pat still doesnt have the third TIMESTOP considering how early i found it
[3:05:27] <%edwardskacz> your nail is currently doing 21 damage, while your starting nail did 5 damage
[3:05:27] <$konekoryugamine> UGH why are the enemies in thei game adorable?! I'm having flashbacks to Undertale of all games!
[3:05:28] <nexoosen> @Donchalant402 aye but theres the other that comes with it
[3:05:31] <pede2011> @AngriestPat combined with fragile strength you one shot most enemies
[3:05:33] <Worldbrand> pat invented water
[3:05:36] <Luftraumm> @angriestpat u been to stag nest yet#
[3:05:37] <cerberuscarmine> zotes precepts are the true end game tactics!
[3:05:38] <+Answer_Moose> Max nail does around 30 points of damage each hit
[3:05:40] <Borealum_EX> you are growing STRONKER
[3:05:43] <$magikestral> @konekoryugamine sounds like you haven't seen deenest
[3:05:47] <$SGrim> @ArcanumMBD by getting good, then re-cucking Zote to get Breta back! rooPog
[3:05:48] <+Dimfish> @AngriestPat Pure Nail does 21 damage, starting nail only did 5 damage
[3:05:53] <$konekoryugamine> @magikestral Deenest?
[3:05:53] <PettyFunk> @AtlasMcCoy Same, but he seems to hate the area it's in so he doesn't seem to wanna explore it (which is fair, the enemies there suck)
[3:05:56] <Donchalant402> @nexoosen fair
[3:05:58] <arcaderabbit48> @konekoryugamine At least Undertale encouraged you be nice to them. Here, you have to slaughter every adorable critter in your way
[3:06:02] <+Tylermcd93> Has he been to the Bee area yet?
[3:06:04] <AtlasMcCoy> Btw pat, bosses get more health when you upgrade your nail
[3:06:08] <$magikestral> @konekoryugamine deepnest, apologies autocorrect
[3:06:08] <Flyrant> damage goes from 17 to 21, so a bit stronger
[3:06:09] <+Omed250> Free soul vessel there
[3:06:22] <$konekoryugamine> @magikestral Ahh, but, Deepnest?
[3:06:24] <%stigna1> @AtlasMcCoy That's...untrue. I'm, like, 96% sure.
[3:06:26] <%Rostichenburg> With the pure nail you can easily explore the Hive

[3:13:36] <%TheImmortal70> @angriestpat Hey remember how I said earlier you were like 40%? Welcome to 55%
[3:13:37] <SchroedingersFerret> Time to go down
[3:13:38] <%Divryne> Bottom of Ancient Basin.
[3:13:38] <custoadian> it's not marked on the map
[3:13:39] <grimporio> BASIN AND THEN DREAMERS
[3:13:39] <arcaderabbit48> "What the fuck. This little shit kid beat me, and then I have to recuse his ass from a collapsing sack of skin. Bug's sake, I hope I don't regret this..."
[3:13:39] <Varanoo> Anciet basin
[3:13:39] <%Sir_Gawain_Lotsson> ANCIENT DAB
[3:13:42] <sileo_patronus> Didn't mark
[3:13:42] <dekkitout> dammit i didnt care for her till she batman'd out
[3:13:43] <+Omed250> Did pat get the up special ability?
[3:13:46] <+Bt_Robot> HIDDEN STATION
[3:13:49] <haisho> Hornet: Is it strong enough....? *watches Knight get buried* Nope. Time to save his ass.
[3:13:50] <AtlasMcCoy> @Omed250 Nope
[3:13:51] <Flyrant> bottom middle of ancient basen
[3:13:52] <Donchalant402> timestop is there
[3:13:56] <%Piemen99> DARK EVIL
[3:13:59] <%Divryne> YEYEYE.
[3:14:00] <sileo_patronus> It's pretty obvious where it is
[3:14:00] <SaltBuster> "Bug's Sake" I like that
[3:14:01] <asbestosflavored> bot mid of basin
[3:14:01] <Borealum_EX> @AngriestPat dreamgate then hidden station
[3:14:01] <nexoosen> @Omed250 he hasnt even been to that area
[3:14:02] <%Divryne> LET'S GOOOO.
[3:14:08] <$magikestral> i messed up, symbol is not on map. But you did notice the location. Time for timestop
[3:14:10] <%NobleJedi> apatBig time stop
[3:14:10] <+harzaz> Big time stop
[3:14:11] <%Kirijuo> It's a really useful timestop
[3:14:11] <leole11> THE BIGGEST TIMESTOP
[3:14:12] <JusTTheGuyYouNeed> big lore is there too
[3:14:18] <+Menace109> The time stop was the friends we made along the way
[3:14:18] <+Dimfish> THE BIGGEST TIMEST STOP
[3:14:20] <%ArcanumMBD> @AngriestPat So using that will lead you to a thing that will lock you out of Ending A. The difference between Ending A and B is minimal, but if you want to see all of them you should deal with the Black Temple first
[3:14:20] <AtlasMcCoy> Guys, Pat should get the other timestop that lets him get a better timestop when he uses timestop in the ancient basin.
[3:14:21] <+JustToWatch> just dreamgate then travel to the hiden station
[3:14:22] <Donchalant402> BIG TIMESTOP
[3:14:23] <+Answer_Moose> oh damn pat's still missing 2 notches
[3:14:24] <leole11> YOU CAN STOP ALL TIME
[3:14:24] <nexoosen> Emotional looooot
[3:14:25] <dekkitout> big timestop energy
[3:14:31] <JGardner88> So is today's RE5 video stuck at 360p for anyone else?
[3:14:34] <+AncientToco> Big girthy timestop
[3:14:35] <Worldbrand> if you put two toblerones together you can create a mostly rectangular chocolate bar
[3:14:42] <zal_silverfang> Timestop isnt there Pat. TimeFREEZE is there
[3:14:48] <%stigna1> Gods, curse us all!
[3:14:50] <+Answer_Moose> This game has THREE endings
[3:14:52] <Eresus> not yet
[3:14:53] <DapperHatwell> Go now
[3:14:54] <PettyFunk> Wait what no
[3:14:55] <scrumdrew> no
[3:14:55] <Estuko> @Worldbrand it also summons Jaden Smith
[3:14:56] <Flyrant> not true
[3:14:56] <leole11> that's correct
[3:14:56] <Borealum_EX> go now
[3:14:56] <+Enderborn18> no you won't
[3:14:57] <%Sir_Gawain_Lotsson> ZA WARUDO
[3:14:57] <Donchalant402> doesnt matter
[3:14:58] <%Divryne> Stop chat.
[3:14:58] <%Kirijuo> You don't get locked out yet
[3:14:59] <Flyrant> incorrect
[3:15:00] <leole11> actually correct
[3:15:00] <custoadian> it's fine now
[3:15:00] <%stigna1> This is very much...not helpful.
[3:15:00] <Borealum_EX> that ending is wack
[3:15:01] <+JustToWatch> @AngriestPat that's super wrong
[3:15:01] <PettyFunk> You can get all endings
[3:15:01] <$Tredecian> the lock out is a two part
[3:15:01] <+ZebraFace> No
[3:15:03] <Kghaleon> That's not true.
[3:15:04] <$magikestral> no that's later
[3:15:04] <+Dimfish> no you wont
[3:15:04] <+BurncoatRapscallion> the ending difference is super minimal
[3:15:04] <Mesonoxian_Methuselah> no you won't, that's WAY later
[3:15:04] <asbestosflavored> LIES
[3:15:05] <ArrogantPrimate> time for greatest Dark Souls reference in the game!
[3:15:06] <%Divryne> You fucks.
[3:15:06] <energywarning> good we're talking about endings now
[3:15:07] <DapperHatwell> You will not prevent any endings
[3:15:08] <Aixenn> game has 4 endings
[3:15:08] <+Dimfish> thats a total lie
[3:15:09] <Flyrant> wrong
[3:15:13] <archxeno> nobody knows what the fuck they're talking about
[3:15:13] <$Mendin> Arcanum is full of shit, you can't get locked out of the ending for awhile yet, but the locking will involve that area
[3:15:14] <+Bt_Robot> iT WILL LOCK YOU OUT OF THE WORST ENDING
[3:15:15] <%Divryne> Why chat.
[3:15:17] <Shastafield> Jebaited
[3:15:20] <%Sir_Gawain_Lotsson> TOKI WO TOMARE
[3:15:21] <SaltBuster> If you combine two tolberones would you make a tolberzoid?
[3:15:22] <%Kuro_Koshka> You only miss an ending if you get a very hard to get key item
[3:15:22] <DivineDragoonKain> the game has three endings, but ending 2 is almost identical to ending 1
[3:15:24] <rossnwolf> WHAT HAVE I MISSED
[3:15:24] <ShawnEXE> No you won't get locked out, you would need to do two different things after that in order to lock yourself out
[3:15:24] <+Dimfish> this is misinformation
[3:15:28] <+Ciphris> think pat got what it takes to take on the palace?
[3:15:28] <%Divryne> STOP SPOILING.
[3:15:34] <Mesonoxian_Methuselah> you can lock yourself out, but you're a few big steps before that can happen
[3:15:36] <WaxWitch> do you even have a mod?
[3:15:36] <Estuko> @SaltBuster you get Toblertwos
[3:15:37] <$magikestral> @angriestpat as someone who beat this game twice, i know exactly what they're talking about. And that is not now.
[3:15:38] <rossnwolf> !uptime
[3:15:38] <@Moobot> I've been playing this game for how long? Oh only 3h 15m 40s.
[3:15:41] <custoadian> the lockout takes some fucking work
[3:15:42] <Flyrant> stop giving wrong info
[3:15:45] <RetributionP> fake news
[3:15:46] <DapperHatwell> You still can
[3:15:48] <Donchalant402> there is no difference
[3:15:49] <grimporio> you can only miss one of the endings if you fully upgrade your dream nail before the final boss
[3:15:49] <%TheImmortal70> @angriestpat There is a very specific sign you will lock yourself out of an ending.
[3:15:50] <+Enderborn18> @AngriestPat The time stop you get from basin will not lock you out of an ending. There are two other time stops that will lock you out of it though.
[3:15:51] <+Answer_Moose> @Divryne we're not spoiling, we're trying to help him see all the endings
[3:15:51] <nexoosen> Goddamn it chat you folks need some chill
[3:15:52] <DivineDragoonKain> it's fine pat, go get the timestop
[3:15:56] <DapperHatwell> There is way more shit to lock out of endings
[3:15:58] <rossnwolf> I missed three fucking hours alright seeya nerds I'm going back to the past
[3:15:58] <cerberuscarmine> keep exploring
[3:16:01] <%stigna1> I really don't understand why people always advise this; the difference is so completely negligable.
[3:16:05] <cerberuscarmine> your fine
[3:16:18] <ShawnEXE> To the what?
[3:16:21] <+Menace109> Am I the only one that knows nothing about this game outside of what I've seen here?
[3:16:24] <%Kahnicus> Your noble steed awaits.
[3:16:25] <frankyxm> hello pat
[3:16:26] <AtlasMcCoy> @AngriestPat Hey pat, there's something you can get fairly quick in fog canyon, which would be worth getting first
[3:16:27] <+Puppet88> i really dont get how its so hard to not backseat? like do people just not have any self control?
[3:16:28] <%ArcanumMBD> @AngriestPat Ah shit they're right, I was misremembering a thing. Nevermind you're good
[3:16:31] <ShawnEXE> Oh shit big door big lore
[3:16:32] <%Rostichenburg> When do you get the extra Hera stuff is it after the Kings Brand?
[3:16:33] <Varanoo> @stigna1 Unlike you they have souls
[3:16:38] <+capnbeeb> Nah man me too
[3:16:40] <asbestosflavored> all 3 endings means railroading to the rest of the dreamers. its super fucky on pathing
[3:16:41] <%mattmanj17> oh yeah, you are NOWHERE near locking your self out of ending 1 @AngriestPat
[3:16:43] <+capnbeeb> Pat showed me how to get wall jump
[3:16:44] <DracaenaLeaf> same
[3:16:44] <nexoosen> @atlas he's prolly explore it more thooroughly in a bit
[3:16:48] <DesuDesuDokiDoki> same
[3:16:56] <%ArcanumMBD> I forgot the two-part thing was needed first
[3:16:58] <$magikestral> @rostichenburg its when you get the thing that locks you out of the ending i think
[3:16:58] <%Sam_Tzu> first time seeing it is pat's streams
[3:17:01] <nexoosen> @AtlasMcCoy he'll explore it more thoroughly in a bit i imagine
[3:17:04] <AtlasMcCoy> @nexoosen But he'd have to come back here after exploring
[3:17:05] <+ZebraFace> Dream nail that boy
[3:17:13] <+Dimfish> this game sold really well so its no surprise a lot of people here know what the deal is
[3:17:19] <%stigna1> @Varanoo But...like...Gah, its hard to avoid spoilers. Thanks anyway!
[3:17:20] <%Sir_Gawain_Lotsson> BLACK EVIL
[3:17:23] <%Kirijuo> The lock oiut is literally that body right there
[3:17:23] <+Puppet88> BLACK EVIL
[3:17:23] <SatansDick1> dram nail that boy
[3:17:23] <Borealum_EX> @AngriestPat to lock yourself out you would need a even bigger timestop pat don't worry
[3:17:27] <Flyrant> you have to get a specific item, which you won't get right now
[3:17:28] <knomad2b> pat has found so many more badhes than i did
[3:17:28] <WaxWitch> I know a bit, but not enough to help anyone
[3:17:28] <asbestosflavored> o, yeah
[3:17:28] <Donchalant402> the black charm
[3:17:29] <SaltBuster> THE BLACK EVIL
[3:17:31] <+Bt_Robot> THE TIMESTOP ITEM
[3:17:31] <Donchalant402> yeah
[3:17:32] <cerberuscarmine> i dont think hes ready for that area yet
[3:17:34] <+Enderborn18> No, you need two separate items to lock you out, not the thing you're getting now.
[3:17:38] <+Dimfish> that is accurate
[3:17:39] <DapperHatwell> Fat black evil
[3:17:40] <%ArcanumMBD> The Black Evil
[3:17:41] <%Kahnicus> Terror Goo!
[3:17:43] <+Epic_Skeptic> Black is evil
[3:17:44] <scrumdrew> da black goku
[3:17:46] <nexoosen> @AtlasMcCoy its not exactly a long journey and he'll wanna go through timestop
[3:17:47] <$Mendin> You need a two-piece timestop to get the big ending timestop
[3:17:47] <PettyFunk> I'm amazed he'll reach the point for AS without every finding HW
[3:17:47] <+JustToWatch> @AngriestPat literally impossible to accidentally lock yourself out
[3:17:50] <+Menace109> It used to be so simple. Link the fire, or don't.
[3:17:50] <Donchalant402> WE LORE NOW BOIS
[3:17:50] <%Rostichenburg> Too separate items and then a timestop
[3:17:51] <%Sir_Gawain_Lotsson> What about the FAT EVIL
[3:17:51] <%Divryne> YEYEYE.
[3:17:52] <%stigna1> We don't go to that place.

[3:27:20] <+Answer_Moose> check your bestiary
[3:27:22] <Pairoschuz> void tendril hunter journal
[3:27:24] <thisisacoolguy> The voice is just hunter
[3:27:26] <+Answer_Moose> tada!
[3:27:26] <DracaenaLeaf> Yes @rdark_ksu
[3:27:28] <%Rostichenburg> Journal entry for the Void Tendrils
[3:27:29] <ShawnEXE> V O I D
[3:27:31] <+BurncoatRapscallion> This shit makes me upset how most of the Abyss stuff was cut
[3:27:33] <$Tredecian> thats how you journal invincible enemies you find them
[3:27:35] <$shadow1man9> Void Tendrals
[3:27:35] <ValidVenasaur> void tendrils
[3:27:36] <Flyrant> it was Void Tendrils
[3:27:36] <%ArcanumMBD> Void Tendrils was it
[3:27:37] <$magikestral> @angriestpat for every enemy that you cannot kill, you find places that give you it. Like this!
[3:27:39] <$ookiiapple> GORB
[3:27:40] <Eresus> it's the void tendrils
[3:27:40] <EMP_Ike_Turner> BASED GORB
[3:27:41] <deviljhojho94> NANI
[3:27:45] <+Answer_Moose> you go the entry for void tendrils, fyi
[3:27:46] <Parapattern> GORB
[3:27:49] <deviljhojho94> GORB
[3:27:51] <thetechnicalraven> How is Pat doing tonight?
[3:27:53] <%stigna1> It opened a thing in the journal, as you can't actually kill them: Void Tendrils. "Fragments of void taking the shape of sharp, thrashing tendrils. The bugs of Hallownest sometimes wondered whether there were other, older, stranger Kingdoms deep below them. What strange fancies they had. That's probably why they were always so distracted and easy to kill."
[3:27:58] <%Rostichenburg> Dream nail the bugs head
[3:28:04] <AncelDeLambert> I think there's just enough void stuff to get the point across, any more would have been too much
[3:28:08] <%Kahnicus> @thetechnicalraven Yeah, my French is rusty as all hell.
[3:28:09] <archxeno> man I want to fight the Hunter
[3:28:19] <PettyFunk> YES

[3:28:31] <knomad2b> i love how iframes are a late game upgrade
[3:28:31] <Eresus> climb up
[3:28:31] <Flyrant> you were the reject though
[3:28:33] <+Rose_Inko> @AngriestPat More of where you were prototyped, than manufactured
[3:28:33] <thisisacoolguy> There was actually a whole planned area for here but the goal wasn't met. You were going to dive into the sea and fight 4 bosses
[3:28:34] <thetechnicalraven> @kahnicus No worries, I barely know French myself
[3:28:37] <Theoyveyman> your birth place
[3:28:37] <$ookiiapple> IS THIS ANOR LONDO? @AngriestPat

[3:28:43] <Jaller101514> Go far left
[3:28:44] <+Answer_Moose> Go all the way to the left side of the wall in this area
[3:28:45] <strangelee> @AngriestPat That answer is explicitly given at a later point
[3:28:50] <mothdude> Why not both?
[3:28:51] <%Divryne> Spoilers you fools.
[3:28:52] <cerberuscarmine> let him find out on his own
[3:28:56] <%Agami23> teleport out?
[3:28:57] <$Mendin> He beat Lost Kin and saw the knight and zote
[3:28:58] <SaltBuster> to be fair iframes are really strong. It'd be really OP if I had iframes in real life.
[3:28:59] <ShawnEXE> He doesn't have that yet to do the left side
[3:29:01] <asbestosflavored> people literally can't contain themselves LUL
[3:29:01] <PettyFunk> @Jaller101514 he didn't even find the thing he needs to obtain the thing on the far left
[3:29:04] <+Dimfish> do not teleport out
[3:29:06] <Jaller101514> far bottom left
[3:29:11] <Jontman42> Fuck off chat once again
[3:29:12] <+Bt_Robot> THIS IS OLDER THAN THAT

[3:31:40] <$SGrim> @AngriestPat if you're curious, you can just equip the charm for blue hearts
[3:31:41] <Zanicedg> He might if he used fragile heart.
[3:31:43] <KayThree> Joni's Blessing and Fragile Health will let you open it
[3:31:44] <Tisaric> oh yeah teleporting makes that easy as hell

[3:32:35] <ekkieekk> GRIMM NOW
[3:32:37] <%ArcanumMBD> Literally "hey you can do ending A, but REAAALLY YOU SHOULD DO THE OTHER ONE"
[3:32:38] <Borealum_EX> @AngriestPat the two blue life charms give you 15 pips I think
[3:32:39] <+Omed250> Hakana Sagamas

[3:33:30] <dekkitout> i think dark knight might be taken cruPF
[3:33:33] <%ArcanumMBD> Hollow Knight is the Dark Souls of "is the Dark Souls of" references
[3:33:33] <EMP_Ike_Turner> dark knight? you trying to get sued by DC
[3:33:33] <+Bt_Robot> 40,000,000,000 VESSELS DEAD, THE WORLD IS A F***

[3:33:36] <$shadow1man9> @AngriestPat You're going to want to kill the other 2 dreamers now
[3:33:44] <Varanoo> doing him will lock out an ending
[3:33:45] <archxeno> absolute coward
[3:33:47] <Flyrant> FIGHT GRIMM
[3:33:49] <+Answer_Moose> Hive time??
[3:33:49] <nexoosen> @AngriestPat ALL THE WALLS ARE BROKEN, EXPLORE TO YOUR HEARTS CONTENT, LET NO-ONE TELL YOU WHERE TO GO AND FOLLOW YOUR DREAMS
[3:33:49] <Estuko> I'm reminded of Vegeta's angry scene from that namek planet where he just shoots across the planet super pissed lol
[3:33:52] <Donchalant402> ?
[3:33:57] <Donchalant402> what for
[3:33:58] <ShawnEXE> He gonna get all the money
[3:34:04] <PettyFunk> @AngriestPat There are important things to discover in Fog Canyon
[3:34:05] <Donchalant402> ah
[3:34:06] <dekkitout> didnt that scream echo through time
[3:34:08] <%Kahnicus> bbiab
[3:34:08] <Donchalant402> yup
[3:34:10] <KayThree> Dreamgate back to blue gate with Joni's Blessing + Fragile Health
[3:34:17] <ShawnEXE> big money no whammy
[3:34:17] <knomad2b> remember when vegeta says "yes boys mondo cool indeed!"
[3:34:18] <MyNameIsRasus> GODDAMN RADIANCE IS HARD
[3:34:23] <SaltBuster> Oh he gonna do the unbreakable.
[3:34:25] <Estuko> @knomad2b god.
[3:34:27] <arcaderabbit48> @dekkitout And shattered reality, among other things
[3:34:28] <$Tredecian> @AngriestPat 9000/12000/15000
[3:34:28] <DracaenaLeaf> every time
[3:34:28] <Flyrant> mondo cool lmao
[3:34:32] <SaltBuster> Which one is he gonna do?
[3:34:36] <+Dimfish> can we not scream out boss names in chat
[3:34:38] <Donchalant402> @AngriestPat there is another one of those arcane eggs behind that blue door btw, that and another goodie
[3:34:38] <dekkitout> pretty sure cabba somehow heard it
[3:34:40] <+Answer_Moose> @KayThree he could also just upgrade fragile to unbreakable heart
[3:34:41] <knomad2b> best part of z
[3:34:42] <$Tredecian> scaling
[3:34:44] <$magikestral> unbreakable strength, deepnest dreamer, bees, Grimm?
[3:34:45] <%ArcanumMBD> Part of me hopes Pat will lose all his money after selling everything
[3:34:46] <Jontman42> If he doesn't read the lore I'm gonna kill someone
[3:34:46] <Eresus> yes
[3:34:47] <ekkieekk> honk
[3:34:50] <cerberuscarmine> chat stop with the spoilers
[3:34:53] <cerberuscarmine> its not cool
[3:34:53] <Donchalant402> Greed, heart, strength
[3:34:55] <Donchalant402> in that order
[3:34:59] <EMP_Ike_Turner> remember when vegeta tried to make his world famous gourmet rice omelette
[3:35:03] <+Jaysky> Has Pat done arena?
[3:35:04] <thisisacoolguy> Pat you probably won't have enough money
[3:35:05] <SaltBuster> Naw he'll just dreamgate after selling
[3:35:06] <count_bob> Has he found all the stagway stations?
[3:35:10] <%stigna1> lul
[3:35:12] <+korth367> yeah in deepnest
[3:35:12] <+Dimfish> @Jaysky yes he has
[3:35:13] <%TheImmortal70> Do strength first are you kidding
[3:35:16] <Flyrant> yeah, but you won't get enough money
[3:35:18] <%ArcanumMBD> Ah big coward approach, that's less entertaining
[3:35:19] <%TheImmortal70> Strength is the only valuable one
[3:35:19] <+Jaysky> All 3 stages?
[3:35:20] <ShawnEXE> zote will stab you in the back when you come out of your portal
[3:35:21] <Donchalant402> @count_bob he hasnt got to queen's garden yet
[3:35:22] <MyNameIsRasus> How exactly is a name a spoiler?
[3:35:24] <DesuDesuDokiDoki> crazy talk incoming
[3:35:27] <nexoosen> @count_bob he has not, missing 2, arguably just the one
[3:35:27] <ShawnEXE> and become the true protagonist
[3:35:28] <$Mendin> Count he hasn't been to the garden yet
[3:35:28] <+Dimfish> @count_bob no he is missing several zones
[3:35:31] <%umbypokochan> will chat yell out spoilers? on the next Pat Stares At.... chat yells out spoilers!
[3:35:33] <Donchalant402> names arents spoilers imo
[3:35:34] <ekkieekk> hell find a way
[3:35:39] <%Rostichenburg> Strength or greed to get the others more easily but heart isn't too good
[3:35:39] <count_bob> Thanks.
[3:35:41] <%TheImmortal70> Names are HUGE spoilers
[3:35:41] <Flyrant> why are you watching a stream if you are trying to avoid spoilers?
[3:35:43] <pede2011> The last boss name is BIG spoiler, are you kidding?
[3:35:46] <+Dimfish> and can we not say the name of zones that pat hasnt been to yet either
[3:35:46] <ShawnEXE> names are spoilers if you can connect the origin of their names
[3:35:48] <nexoosen> @Donchalant402 names are big spoilers
[3:35:52] <%stigna1> @MyNameIsRasus Because names have meaning, you spoilerboi.
[3:35:53] <Donchalant402> nah
[3:35:55] <knomad2b> @EMP_Ike_Turner i loved that. some of the showsdumbest parts are my faves
[3:35:56] <+Bt_Robot> YOU MISSED AN ELMO IN CROSSROADS, THINK ABOUT DOING THAT FOR CLEANUP
[3:35:58] <+Dimfish> @Flyrant its a blind playthrough
[3:36:03] <+Answer_Moose> @cerberuscarmine honestly we're not spoiling anything, things like the blue door are pretty unclear on their own.
[3:36:07] <%PatNTheHat> AN LARGE UNDERSTANDING
[3:36:09] <Flyrant> Pat can ignore chat
[3:36:14] <cerberuscarmine> still stop
[3:36:15] <Flyrant> he's a big boy
[3:36:19] <+Dimfish> right but youre aware that he doesnt
[3:36:22] <+Jaysky> Or he could read it and get spoiled.
[3:36:23] <+Dimfish> he interacts with his community
[3:36:23] <$magikestral> there are only three arcane eggs, so you know it's rare
[3:36:25] <Donchalant402> @Bt_Robot elmo clean up can come later when he has the way of making it easy
[3:36:27] <%burgahb> apatDab
[3:36:33] <mothdude> Teleporting castle?
[3:36:37] <SaltBuster> Oh Paul
[3:36:37] <%Rostichenburg> The scream room is way too vague
[3:36:38] <+Dimfish> the courteous thing to do would be to not post end game spoilers
[3:36:39] <thetechnicalraven> Someone whisper me the final boss Kappa
[3:36:39] <%stigna1> @Answer_Moose Time stop, and door are chill. There was some guy listing off the names of ultra-lategame bosses.
[3:36:43] <+Bt_Robot> YES, THE TIME STOP
[3:36:44] <MyNameIsRasus> I mean, agree to disagree, but I'll refrain from doing it in the future
[3:36:44] <$Tredecian> @AngriestPat sorry i thought it was scaling bc i alway did it in order// cheap>high greed/heart/strength
[3:36:46] <nexoosen> But he doesnt, he chooses to interact witth chat to make it more interactive and fun for us, the viewers *looks at camera*
[3:36:50] <%ArcanumMBD> If I was less lazy I would start spelling out important spoiler names using the first letter of every word of my sentence just to spite chat, but alas
[3:36:54] <+Tylermcd93> What does he need money for at this point?
[3:36:56] <mothdude> Velme artred.
[3:36:56] <Zanicedg> VELMI ARTRID!!!
[3:37:00] <CptBritches> Big money for big Boivin
[3:37:04] <Flyrant> well he already fought Grimm, not sure what other bosses people have been calling out
[3:37:07] <$magikestral> @tylermcd93 unbreakable charm
[3:37:07] <knomad2b> we are hitting a point in the game where chat will hopefully be mondo cool and not spoil
[3:37:11] <%ArcanumMBD> @Tylermcd93 a thing in the Grimm Troupe dlc
[3:37:11] <+Tylermcd93> Ohhh
[3:37:12] <pede2011> @AngriestPat ARE YOU READY TO ONE SHOT FOOLS!?
[3:37:12] <@PlagueOfGripes> bellamy archers
[3:37:13] <EMP_Ike_Turner> @knomad2b goofy shit is best shit
[3:37:15] <$Mendin> to devil's advocate, one person said a name and someone ELSE said what relevance that name had, so the spoiler was a team effort Kappa
[3:37:17] <+Answer_Moose> @stigna1 I've been here for..idk 2 hours and all I've seen is chat scream grimm. lol
[3:37:19] <%stigna1> @Flyrant Specifically, the final boss.
[3:37:21] <+Dimfish> @Tylermcd93 he needs 15000 geo to upgrade his fragile strength
[3:37:22] <Estuko> Masterworks all you can't go wrong
[3:37:26] <BaronVonDickButt> *Sigh* Baffinada
[3:37:28] <+Tylermcd93> I see
[3:37:28] <dekkitout> blimey orchid
[3:37:34] <+Dimfish> yes people were screaming out the final boss in all caps
[3:37:36] <Tisaric> I love the voice acting so much
[3:37:38] <thisisacoolguy> pahhh opal
[3:37:40] <+Dimfish> and zones he hasnt even been near yet
[3:37:41] <Flyrant> oh didn't see that
[3:37:42] <ShawnEXE> I personally would get the greed to get the money for the rest faster
[3:37:45] <%ArcanumMBD> It's not a shop. He's a collector. He aint selling you shit
[3:37:46] <$Tredecian> its a collection lol he only buys
[3:37:52] <SaltBuster> Boorish Son
[3:38:02] <scrumdrew> i think you just have enough for the strength
[3:38:03] <%Rostichenburg> He lives here
[3:38:04] <%stigna1> @Answer_Moose We've met Grimm. Specifically, someone was talking about the literal final boss of the
[3:38:06] <%stigna1> game.
[3:38:14] <+Dimfish> city of tears is super nice its not a shithole
[3:38:17] <+Answer_Moose> Well that's rude
[3:38:21] <knomad2b> well pats steve jobs rich now
[3:38:21] <Sol_Install> can't he sell in mass?
[3:38:23] <leole11> yep, they made a city under a lake
[3:38:23] <+Dimfish> its better than 90% of the underground
[3:38:30] <leole11> and they made their writings in toilet paper
[3:38:33] <nexoosen> Cant unhear bellamy arrchers
[3:38:35] <%ArcanumMBD> @Sol_Install nope, the technology is too advanced for bugs
[3:38:36] <Flyrant> for some reason you can't @Sol_Install
[3:38:37] <thetechnicalraven> Can someone whisper me the final boss?
[3:38:37] <Mesonoxian_Methuselah> I can't believe that you had exactly the right amount.
[3:38:39] <zal_silverfang> literally just enough
[3:38:41] <cerberuscarmine> all the monehhh
[3:38:41] <AncelDeLambert> do you even NEED this money?
[3:38:42] <mtgtin> YEYEYE
[3:38:42] <%Rostichenburg> No there's lore for all selling
[3:38:44] <$Tredecian> @Sol_Install he has lore for each sale up to a point
[3:38:44] <Donchalant402> @AngriestPat Pure nail does 21 damage, and the strength charm will buff that up to 31
[3:38:45] <cerberuscarmine> LOADS OF MONEH
[3:38:46] <Sol_Install> Very weird
[3:38:46] <+Dimfish> @Sol_Install he gets new lore for each entry he sells
[3:38:47] <ValidVenasaur> pretty sure you get a discount with he poop charm

[3:40:52] <dekkitout> best believe that things as dense as a white dwaf now
[3:40:53] <pede2011> SOMEONE CLIP THAT SHIT
[3:40:53] <%Sirculbs> You said to give you the shit. Careful what you wish for
[3:40:55] <VritraReiRei> @AngriestPat well you did say you wanted her "shit" LUL
[3:40:57] <BaronVonDickButt> SLURMS MCKENZY!
[3:40:57] <ShawnEXE> Quick slash probably
[3:40:58] <%TheImmortal70> Quick slash
[3:40:59] <Shastafield> OpieOP i wonder what it smells like
[3:40:59] <$Mendin> Reforged Through Poop
[3:41:00] <$shadow1man9> Quick Slash
[3:41:01] <Flyrant> Shaman's stone is the best
[3:41:01] <alcors_wisdom> he doesnt have the money
[3:41:01] <%umbypokochan> the best charm is the charm that you keep in your heart
[3:41:02] <EMP_Ike_Turner> NEVER BEEN MORE ICKY POOEY
[3:41:02] <leole11> Quick slash
[3:41:04] <ValidVenasaur> mark of pride
[3:41:05] <+Tylermcd93> Quick slash
[3:41:06] <pede2011> GRUBSONG, I usck
[3:41:07] <alcors_wisdom> also that bitch is a whore
[3:41:07] <Aixenn> Quick Slash
[3:41:08] <Flyrant> quick slash is not the best
[3:41:08] <Kghaleon> Hardcore grind to get the others upgraded.
[3:41:09] <$magikestral> quick slash is probably up there
[3:41:09] <%TheImmortal70> you can't even contest
[3:41:13] <AncelDeLambert> and then he doesn't equip it
[3:41:15] <+Dimfish> quick slash or shaman stone depending on your build focus
[3:41:16] <+Answer_Moose> Quick slash is NOT the best anymore after they nerfed it
[3:41:17] <+Bt_Robot> ITS THE ONE IN DEEPNEST
[3:41:17] <BeNiceImShy> The best charm is the friends we made along the way
[3:41:17] <thisisacoolguy> the kill grimm charm its what you get when you kill grimm
[3:41:18] <%ArcanumMBD> Best charm is Compass charm
[3:41:19] <cerberuscarmine> grimm boi is the best
[3:41:20] <scrumdrew> they nerfed quick slash and its still the best
[3:41:22] <ekkieekk> fight grimm
[3:41:22] <cerberuscarmine> cuz hes ya boi
[3:41:22] <alcors_wisdom> showed you her ass for coin
[3:41:25] <Aixenn> Quick Slash + Unbreakable Strenght is way to good
[3:41:25] <Donchalant402> QUICK
[3:41:28] <%TheImmortal70> Quick slash's nerf is literally an extra charm slot
[3:41:29] <ShawnEXE> quick
[3:41:29] <Mesonoxian_Methuselah> quick
[3:41:30] <+JustToWatch> @AngriestPat you need to have grimmchild on to fight grimm
[3:41:37] <Flyrant> shaman stone makes most bosses trivial as your basic upgraded spell can hit twice for 80 damage
[3:41:39] <%TheImmortal70> It's still 50%~ attack increase
[3:41:43] <knomad2b> quick with strength breaks the game
[3:41:46] <+Jaysky> How nerfed is quick slash exactly? I haven't played since beating Grimm
[3:41:46] <$magikestral> @angriestpat there's little to spend your geo on now. No real reason to collect it with the swarm
[3:41:48] <MyNameIsRasus> Sounds like someone needs another notch
[3:41:49] <ShawnEXE> Big Dick go down
[3:41:58] <+Dimfish> here we go
[3:42:04] <leole11> nice
[3:42:05] <cerberuscarmine> there he is :D
[3:42:08] <%TheImmortal70> @Jaysky Not at all. Unbreakable strength plus quickslash on bosses that don't move too much is just a dps check
[3:42:10] <+Dimfish> well unless he wants to upgrade his other shit
[3:42:11] <pede2011> @AngriestPat Defenders Crest is better than Thorns
[3:42:12] <strangelee> Let him bow @AngriestPat
[3:42:14] <+Dimfish> or buy other things later
[3:42:14] <%TheImmortal70> WELP HERE WE GO AGAIN
[3:42:14] <$Tredecian> heart and greed are okay
[3:42:14] <nexoosen> WE DOIN IT
[3:42:15] <%Rostichenburg> Are we fighting the Blakula?
[3:42:15] <SaltBuster> Well, he can collect geo for the other unbreakables I guess
[3:42:15] <AtlasMcCoy> You can go for completionist and upgrade the other 2 fragiles
[3:42:16] <AncelDeLambert> well, unless he wants the other ones made better
[3:42:16] <Kghaleon> well, unless you want the other charm upgrades
[3:42:17] <alcors_wisdom> cant he upgrade again though?
[3:42:17] <+yet_another_brony> except upgrading the rest of the breakable charms
[3:42:20] <$magikestral> the other charms are good, but you'd grind the colloseum for that
[3:42:22] <pede2011> LET HIM BOW
[3:42:24] <Aixenn> Dude i LOVE Grimm so much <3
[3:42:24] <+Answer_Moose> oh wait..

[3:42:58] <v_o_m_i_t> SourPls
[3:42:59] <%ArcanumMBD> You can hit him with spells during the bullet hell
[3:42:59] <+Jaysky> Pat please don't be rude to the local vampire bugs
[3:43:01] <Flyrant> lol
[3:43:03] <+Meiou> is this the hollow knight version of dracula XP
[3:43:03] <Flyrant> this fight
[3:43:03] <+Crows_feet> I remember spending like 3 hours on NKG.
[3:43:05] <+Rose_Inko> This music is great, those drums are great
[3:43:05] <frankyxm> LUL good going
[3:43:08] <v_o_m_i_t> MULLIGAN
[3:43:08] <Worldbrand> shade cloak useful for these fights?
[3:43:09] <ShawnEXE> Don't forget what your new dash can do
[3:43:11] <+BurncoatRapscallion> Love Grimm so much
[3:43:11] <knomad2b> has a shory
[3:43:11] <wired_soul> take all the shots
[3:43:13] <SatansDick1> the music is great
[3:43:13] <Donchalant402> @AngriestPat replace thorns with steady body, there are parts of this fight where you cant deal damage if you get cause the knockback would hurt you, when the spikes come from the ground
[3:43:13] <arcaderabbit48> WE WILL ALL BURN TOGETHER
[3:43:14] <AncelDeLambert> I HATE the endless patterns on the late-game bosses
[3:43:15] <%Rostichenburg> These aren't locals they're out of towners
[3:43:16] <Flyrant> get bodied
[3:43:17] <arcaderabbit48> AND BECOME AS BUGS
[3:43:18] <ekkieekk> dont hit him while hes bowing
[3:43:19] <strangelee> @AngriestPat you're jumping into a stage 2 attack by hitting him during the bow
[3:43:19] <cerberuscarmine> rip
[3:43:19] <%kenpachi9211> apatDab DEATH COUNT 80 apatDab
[3:43:21] <$Mendin> Dracula watched the moves the SotN protagonists can pull and upgraded
[3:43:22] <dekkitout> this guy watched ALL the vampire adjacent anime
[3:43:24] <%Rostichenburg> you can be as rude as you want
[3:43:25] <Zanicedg> @AngriestPat Don't hit him during bow to skip first attack.
[3:43:26] <Mesonoxian_Methuselah> Jebaited
[3:43:26] <BaronVonDickButt> its like your not even trying
[3:43:27] <thetechnicalraven> LUL
[3:43:28] <pede2011> @AngriestPat Defender's crest is better
[3:43:28] <Kghaleon> When he does the spikes, thats the best time to heal
[3:43:31] <%Sirculbs> He just got timestop and isn't using it
[3:43:32] <+harzaz> Bow
[3:43:37] <$magikestral> when he does the ground spikes, you can heal between them
[3:43:38] <Sulfazinum> you have the invincible dogde now
[3:43:38] <Flyrant> quick focus
[3:43:40] <+harzaz> bow to him
[3:43:41] <+Jaysky> Please be polite sir
[3:43:44] <knomad2b> remember the dash is now godlike
[3:43:47] <+Answer_Moose> Grimm is a fight of patience
[3:43:47] <%ArcanumMBD> @AngriestPat you can dream nail him during his bow
[3:43:48] <Qashti> Maybe I should go to jail to get my name up Then get out and show you how to fuck the game up Keep my name out yo' mouth, keep yo' chain tucked Keep yo' dame cuffed, I could make her famous
[3:43:48] <Aixenn> Grimm is best bug Boyfriend <3
[3:43:49] <Donchalant402> during the bow is a good time to use a charge attack
[3:43:51] <%Kuro_Koshka> Invincible Shadow Dodge Dude
[3:43:54] <Theoyveyman> WHAT IS A MAN? A MISERABLE PILE OF SECRETS. BUT ENOUGH TALK, HAVE AT THEE!
[3:43:58] <Mesonoxian_Methuselah> remember to use shadow dash
[3:44:01] <+Dimfish> what is a bug
[3:44:05] <+Bt_Robot> HE IS INVINCIBLE WHEN HE INFLATES
[3:44:08] <Mesonoxian_Methuselah> "end" LUL
[3:44:08] <ShawnEXE> "end of the game"
[3:44:09] <Donchalant402> I mean yeah
[3:44:09] <Flyrant> yeah remember you can dodge through him when your dodge is up
[3:44:10] <%Rostichenburg> Shadow dash has a recharge
[3:44:10] <SchroedingersFerret> DIE MONSTER!
[3:44:11] <+Dimfish> "end of the game"
[3:44:11] <Tisaric> "end"
[3:44:12] <cerberuscarmine> what is a paige?!
[3:44:12] <+Dimfish> ehehehehehe
[3:44:15] <Donchalant402> its technically the end
[3:44:16] <$SGrim> Like 50%
[3:44:19] <Donchalant402> since its the very bottom
[3:44:19] <AtlasMcCoy> Quick focus might be good if you have trouble finding a time to heal
[3:44:23] <SaltBuster> a miserable pile of lupus?
[3:44:26] <$magikestral> closer to the end than not
[3:44:27] <$Mendin> 60-75% depending
[3:44:28] <wired_soul> he ate your pet bug again
[3:44:31] <+Dimfish> @Donchalant402 "very bottom"
[3:44:31] <%Rostichenburg> You aren't always invincible during dodge
[3:44:32] <mothdude> You can actually shoot spells at him when he inflates.
[3:44:33] <mtgtin> a miserable pile of lupus
[3:44:37] <%TheImmortal70> I'd say he's finally at 60%
[3:44:37] <knomad2b> i wonder how good the new dlc chars are
[3:44:39] <Donchalant402> @Dimfish shhhh
[3:44:43] <%TheImmortal70> He needs to get the last dreamer for 65%
[3:44:48] <+Dimfish> @Donchalant402 shhhhhhhhhhhhh
[3:44:54] <%stigna1> Man, Grimm is the coolest.
[3:44:58] <EMP_Ike_Turner> SourPls
[3:45:05] <SatansDick1> fuck this song is greaat
[3:45:05] <+Ciphris> makes me think of Dracula a little bit
[3:45:06] <WisdomHat> PAT. INVINCIBLE DODGE
[3:45:08] <knomad2b> grim does not mess around damn
[3:45:11] <%Kirijuo> SourPls
[3:45:18] <cerberuscarmine> fun fact grimm is pretty hard
[3:45:22] <%Rostichenburg> The children of the night what sweet music they make
[3:45:23] <Mesonoxian_Methuselah> I forgot how much less stressful normal Grimm is considering he only hurts for one pip per hit.
[3:45:24] <+Jaysky> You don't know the half of it knomad2b
[3:45:28] <Flyrant> first form grimm is kinda easy
[3:45:32] <$Mendin> He's A Dracula, yes
[3:45:39] <+Dimfish> not bats, bugs
[3:45:42] <+eagleclassgamer> What the fuck is with this Skull Girls level animation
[3:45:46] <Tisaric> I love the vocals kicking in
[3:45:46] <ekkieekk> fuckin love this song
[3:45:48] <knomad2b> i beat this b4 any dlc dropped and now i have no idea where to start any lol @Jaysky
[3:45:48] <$magikestral> batbugs
[3:45:56] <%Kirijuo> Never forget the person who did the music did it for free
[3:45:57] <Theoyveyman> LIKE DRACULA FROM CASTLEVANIA
[3:45:57] <+Dimfish> grimms theme is so killer
[3:46:00] <%ArcanumMBD> @AngriestPat You can dream nail him when he bows for free soul. And you can hit him with spells when he puffs up
[3:46:01] <Donchalant402> @AngriestPat when he shoots his fireballs you can do a dash slash in the middle for BIG damage
[3:46:01] <Aixenn> I believe Grimm is supposed to be a demonic Firefly basically
[3:46:05] <$Mendin> Triple Divekick 2stronk
[3:46:06] <%Rostichenburg> He's one of them vampire bugs
[3:46:07] <%Kirijuo> he didn't have to go this hard but he did
[3:46:07] <+Answer_Moose> Don't bother trying to heal for this boss pat
[3:46:07] <%kenpachi9211> apatDab DEATH COUNT 81 apatDab
[3:46:09] <Borealum_EX> you basically can't heal
[3:46:10] <ShawnEXE> Yeah don't think about healing normally
[3:46:11] <Mesonoxian_Methuselah> Pat needs quick focus
[3:46:12] <Zanicedg> @AngriestPat Try to dash through his dashes. It's a useful skill to learn for other bosses.
[3:46:12] <Flyrant> damn the composer did it for free?
[3:46:13] <Zombrocom> He is teleporting around, shooting fireballs from his cape, and turning into bats. he is literally castlevania dracula
[3:46:15] <thisisacoolguy> Pat you can dodge through his attacks y'know
[3:46:16] <Flyrant> that's nuts
[3:46:17] <$shadow1man9> Pat, remember your dodge has iframes now
[3:46:19] <DivineDragoonKain> You're doing good, but remember your dash can take you through him
[3:46:19] <PettyFunk> Pat remember your dash now phases through projectiles
[3:46:19] <$magikestral> heal when he does the groundspikes
[3:46:21] <Donchalant402> WGT
[3:46:23] <cerberuscarmine> pat is so excited
[3:46:23] <Tisaric> Unless you have Unn on, you can't heal for shit
[3:46:24] <+Dimfish> poopin it up
[3:46:24] <cerberuscarmine> :D
[3:46:25] <Donchalant402> WHY
[3:46:27] <dekkitout> divekick *now from orbit
[3:46:28] <%Piemen99> THE STENCH
[3:46:29] <knomad2b> looks like u can heal when he spikes
[3:46:29] <+Jaysky> I mean he can heal if he times it, or has quick heal
[3:46:30] <Kghaleon> He can heal between the spike attack, plenty of time for two heals
[3:46:34] <BaronVonDickButt> Poop always provails
[3:46:35] <DivineDragoonKain> magic can hurt him during his touhou phase but it's not worth it while learning
[3:46:36] <+Dimfish> yeah unn makes healing in this fight a possibility
[3:46:38] <asbestosflavored> unbench the stench
[3:46:47] <Donchalant402> WHAT KIND OF BUG IS HE EVEN
[3:46:48] <thisisacoolguy> Healing with ground spikes is also possible
[3:47:05] <%PatNTheHat> A vampire bug, obviously
[3:47:07] <thetechnicalraven> Mosquito LUL
[3:47:08] <Theoyveyman> There are plenty of times to heal in this fight
[3:47:10] <Tisaric> The stink is actually really good with how much he tracks
[3:47:14] <+Bt_Robot> DRACUBUG
[3:47:16] <+Jaysky> Despite being stuck on him for a good while I enjoyed most of the time. Music, design, overall pretty fun
[3:47:27] <knomad2b> touhou shit
[3:47:30] <Shastafield> it even sounds like castlevania music
[3:47:33] <asbestosflavored> BIG DODGE PogChamp
[3:47:42] <Flyrant> I love NMK's intro
[3:47:46] <+Ciphris> HEROIC AURA
[3:47:48] <Tisaric> God the shadow dash is sick
[3:47:48] <Burpinator1> Its funny but the more you get used to dodging his attacks the more fun it feels
[3:47:49] <ekkieekk> youre getting the hang of it
[3:47:51] <iwa5h4ck3d> This boss is EPIC
[3:47:55] <cerberuscarmine> such good music
[3:47:55] <dekkitout> grimm for smash when SeriousSloth
[3:47:58] <mothdude> claps!
[3:47:58] <pede2011> I beat Grimm without the dash and without pure nail. I felt so dumb afterwards
[3:47:59] <EMP_Ike_Turner> Kappa //
[3:47:59] <%Rostichenburg> From the Wiki: Arguments have been made for his being a Calyptra moth, a group of parasitic moths that drink the blood of vertebrates, similarly to mosquitoes
[3:47:59] <Flyrant> why does he have safe DPs?
[3:48:01] <cerberuscarmine> THE CROWD LOVES IT
[3:48:05] <nexoosen> T H E R I T U A L
[3:48:05] <%PatNTheHat> @Jaysky Yeah, he seems like a boss that you wouldn't necessarily hate having to fight again and again
[3:48:08] <%Sirculbs> He's getting the hang of it
[3:48:13] <ekkieekk> the best place to be when he does the uppercut is right next to him to dodge the fire
[3:48:15] <%stigna1> @Burpinator1 You know when you get so into it, and its almost like dancing or something? I totally get why its more hype as you get into it.
[3:48:16] <Flyrant> he's a cool boss
[3:48:20] <cerberuscarmine> crazy talk noooo
[3:48:22] <BaronVonDickButt> he needs to learn to stand still at times
[3:48:24] <%Kahnicus> Cool fight.
[3:48:25] <thetechnicalraven> This reminds me of the Valentini boss fight from Evil Within 2. Can't remember that fucker's full name
[3:48:25] <%Jpdodds> !uptime
[3:48:26] <@Moobot> I've been playing this game for how long? Oh only 3h 48m 27s.
[3:48:33] <+Bt_Robot> IT IS A DANCE, A DANCE WITH DEATH
[3:48:33] <BakerBrute> His dp is the only attack I have no idea how to punish
[3:48:36] <Flyrant> pat should shoot spells at him more
[3:48:37] <knomad2b> did he get all the sword moves?
[3:48:40] <%Zaku_42> "What is an insect? a miserable pile of secrets!"
[3:48:40] <Burpinator1> This fight is straight up a dance once you know it. @stigna1
[3:48:40] <%Rostichenburg> It's probably why they keep referencing this as a dance
[3:48:42] <Donchalant402> @AngriestPat when he shoots his fireballs you can do a dash slash in the air between them for big damage and some extra hits afterwards
[3:48:43] <BaronVonDickButt> STOP RUNNING INTO EASILY DODGABLE SHIT
[3:48:45] <nexoosen> He's doing good though, definately improving between tries
[3:48:45] <+Dimfish> nope
[3:48:49] <%kenpachi9211> apatDab DEATH COUNT 82 apatDab
[3:48:50] <mothdude> When he does the ground spikes is the best time to heal.
[3:48:51] <+Answer_Moose> Stop trying to heal!
[3:48:51] <cerberuscarmine> you got this pat
[3:48:52] <+tehbuu> oh yikes
[3:48:52] <pede2011> @AngriestPat Get rid of mark and crest and try joni
[3:48:52] <BakerBrute> You getting better
[3:48:54] <+wal__rus> boooo
[3:48:54] <thetechnicalraven> LUL
[3:48:55] <BakerBrute> I belive in you
[3:48:55] <+Crows_feet> Imagine how much trouble he's gonna have with NKG
[3:48:56] <SaltBuster> He's Learning though so thats good
[3:48:57] <+Dimfish> hes doing so much better than i did
[3:48:57] <Estuko> run into everything
[3:48:57] <custoadian> this fight is so good
[3:48:58] <Flyrant> use your spells more pat, ditch the poop flies
[3:48:58] <+tehbuu> pat's here, huh
[3:49:01] <%Sirculbs> Maybe try Unn?
[3:49:04] <CptBritches> All damage all the time
[3:49:07] <undeuxtroisqua> *FARTS EXTERNALLY*
[3:49:07] <%ArcanumMBD> @AngriestPat It's simple, just hit him and dont get hit. duh
[3:49:08] <+Answer_Moose> @Crows_feet shhhh
[3:49:08] <thisisacoolguy> take zotes advice
[3:49:08] <%Rostichenburg> You can bounce on his arm during fireball for damage
[3:49:09] <drfaustisdead> that drill cloak shit is the coolest.
[3:49:12] <Flyrant> spells do way more damage than the poop
[3:49:14] <VeryTricky> you stink pat
[3:49:14] <+Bt_Robot> GO TO DEEPNEST AND GET THE TIMESTOP BADGE
[3:49:15] <+korth367> if you cant heal then get 2x hp
[3:49:15] <%TheImmortal70> Unn's shape is funny, but it's worthless
[3:49:15] <dekkitout> this guy's red evil makes your black evil look like blue saftey
[3:49:16] <Donchalant402> @AngriestPat when he shoots his fireballs you can do a dash slash in the air between them for big damage and some extra hits afterwards
[3:49:16] <+Gorgen> rub Elmos tummy for good luck
[3:49:17] <JittersCaffeine> Pat’s strategy of getting hit over and over is really interesting
[3:49:18] <CptBritches> Are you a Melee player
[3:49:18] <pede2011> @AngriestPat Try Joni, Couble HP
[3:49:19] <BakerBrute> @Crows_feet NKG is gonna be a dream come true
[3:49:19] <knomad2b> he loves the pooh
[3:49:21] <+Dimfish> @Sirculbs he doesnt have enough charm notches to do good aggro and shape of unn
[3:49:22] <Tisaric> the poop is actually fairly good for him
[3:49:22] <+Answer_Moose> @Crows_feet he doens't know about that yet
[3:49:27] <ShawnEXE> The poo is the best
[3:49:27] <%stigna1> Shoot at the cyberdemon until it dies.
[3:49:28] <Burpinator1> I remember going into grimm fight with a Shaman Stone + Flukenest build
[3:49:28] <Mesonoxian_Methuselah> just win lol 4Head
[3:49:28] <ekkieekk> poop is pretty good
[3:49:30] <+tehbuu> poop is very strong pat, but do u have the nail extending parts equipped?
[3:49:32] <%TheImmortal70> @angriestpat You are literally almost there, you just need to practice
[3:49:33] <Flyrant> poop does tiny damage though
[3:49:37] <RetributionP> poop looks pretty poop
[3:49:39] <Tampaoster> You need to get the bus to GITGUD TOWN
[3:49:40] <CptBritches> You could go for a magic build and become a DPS cannon
[3:49:41] <nexoosen> Honestly i think at this point charms are more preferance
[3:49:42] <Futuretimetraveller> The upward spell can hit him when he's in ballon form
[3:49:45] <ekkieekk> yeah you can totally do this
[3:49:45] <+JustToWatch> Zote Law #1: always win
[3:49:52] <%Piemen99> You reallly gotta stop prioritizing healing over actually moving around his attacks jkust wait for his spike raise @AngriestPat
[3:49:52] <Flyrant> Magic build = best build
[3:49:54] <%stigna1> @Futuretimetraveller Alas, pat does not have timestop yet.
[3:49:58] <knomad2b> a good spin woul deal a ton of ouch
[3:50:00] <%Rostichenburg> Did Pat ever even get the upwards spell?
[3:50:00] <%whistlehunter> Hello Patrice!
[3:50:01] <%ArcanumMBD> @TheImmortal70 Unn's Shape, Quick Focus, and Spore shroom are what helped me beat Nightmare Grimm. Definitely not worthless
[3:50:01] <nexoosen> @Futuretimetraveller he doesnt have the up b
[3:50:02] <Futuretimetraveller> Ah
[3:50:05] <+Dimfish> @angriest pat howling wraiths, your up+b move, can hit him in his balloon form
[3:50:06] <%Kahnicus> Good dodge
[3:50:07] <Futuretimetraveller> mb
[3:50:08] <leole11> A magic build without one of the spells? genius
[3:50:13] <+Dimfish> he does have the up b nexoosen
[3:50:14] <$Mendin> @Rostichenburg he has never gotten there yet
[3:50:18] <PettyFunk> @Dimfish he never found it.
[3:50:19] <Flyrant> eh the up spell doesn't help in this fight
[3:50:19] <+Gorgen> dash through his shit?
[3:50:20] <cerberuscarmine> there ya go!
[3:50:21] <undeuxtroisqua> Cape move is oddly similar to dracula's
[3:50:21] <+Bt_Robot> PAT FORGOT HE HAD NAIL ARTS
[3:50:21] <SaltBuster> If he's gonna use nail arts, he should use the nailmaster instead of poop
[3:50:21] <+Answer_Moose> Anyways, I'm out all! Good luck with Grimm night Pat! Welcome to the true dark souls boss!
[3:50:23] <+Dimfish> what?!
[3:50:23] <+Jaysky> It's difficult to adjust to not healing
[3:50:25] <Donchalant402> @Dimfish he doesnt have it
[3:50:27] <+Dimfish> how the hell did he never find it
[3:50:28] <nexoosen> @Dimfish he has not been to garden yet
[3:50:30] <leole11> the up spell literall does the most damage
[3:50:38] <Flyrant> as long as you have the upgrade of the first spell magic build = god mode
[3:50:40] <ShawnEXE> nail arts aren't that good in this fight
[3:50:43] <+Dimfish> i mean you can get it well before unlocking the garden
[3:50:45] <$Mendin> The dash-slash is pretty good
[3:50:54] <$Mendin> Avoid attack, airsadh-slash Grimm befor the teleport
[3:50:55] <PettyFunk> He said he didn't like the zone, so he never explored it fully
[3:50:56] <knomad2b> nice
[3:50:58] <Theoyveyman> SE
[3:50:58] <Zombrocom> I feel like DPS racing him is the best strat here
[3:51:00] <Flyrant> as long as you have the notches for it
[3:51:06] <knomad2b> u got some heal timing down
[3:51:22] <Zombrocom> Maybe not for pat though
[3:51:23] <+Jaysky> I never found the up spell either until way later
[3:51:28] <%Rostichenburg> Yeah they shouldn't of hid the map behind a black wall
[3:51:33] <aeonicvector> DPS race + well timed ability use is the key, he's at the point where heals dont exist
[3:51:44] <%TheImmortal70> I like how the music pauses when he goes into his baby form
[3:51:44] <%ArcanumMBD> I love that the vocals kick in during this part
[3:51:52] <Flyrant> don't give up pat!
[3:51:55] <EMP_Ike_Turner> is there a little of Phantom of the Opera Theme in this song or is it just me
[3:51:55] <+tehbuu> you cant get too greedy on the uppercut and the divekick, i know backseat gaming is annoying but its best to conserve life
[3:52:06] <Mesonoxian_Methuselah> Confession: I cheesed this version of Grimm by spamming Abyss Shriek under his puffer fish attack with Shaman Stone and Spell Twister.
[3:52:09] <$magikestral> i don't know if poop is doing much for you, would probably prefer grubsong
[3:52:10] <+tehbuu> tho the pogo hops on the divekick are really good
[3:52:12] <%Rostichenburg> You can heal for three when he explodes and if you're lucky during his fireballs
[3:52:13] <knomad2b> this CLUTCH

[3:53:58] <cerberuscarmine> grim boi op
[3:53:59] <%TheImmortal70> @angriestpat Alright, so, you are almost done with Grimm. However, you might want to stop at the forgotten village.
[3:54:00] <thisisacoolguy> there's 4 but you only need 3
[3:54:01] <DivineDragoonKain> there's four flames when you only need three. One is special
[3:54:02] <LORDSPOOKLEKINS> Did he beat grim?
[3:54:02] <Estuko> bugelmo

[3:54:07] <Tampaoster> Grim boi go UP
[3:54:10] <Eresus> deepnest first
[3:54:10] <Flyrant> he beat grimm
[3:54:11] <Donchalant402> and an optional end
[3:54:11] <%Rostichenburg> Make sure you do the one in Deepnest
[3:54:13] <%Piemen99> ONLY 3 PAT JUST WHICH ONE IS GOOD FOR YOU
[3:54:15] <thetechnicalraven> Grimm has to be a fucking bedbug
[3:54:15] <Aixenn> oh pat make a poo aoe build?
[3:54:17] <%jiin6> oh he's walking fart gas now

[3:54:21] <knomad2b> pats way better all the sudden
[3:54:22] <nexoosen> @AngriestPat still a ton of places you havent explored, all are pretty good to go to so just go where ever
[3:54:22] <$Tredecian> beware the lockout
[3:54:23] <knomad2b> like
[3:54:24] <+Dimfish> @LORDSPOOKLEKINS he built grimms opening act
[3:54:25] <BakerBrute> SOMEBODY WARN PAT NOT TO FUCK UP GRIMM TROUPE
[3:54:25] <%Kahnicus> Well done Ginger Bastard.
[3:54:25] <thetechnicalraven> Imagine mosquitoes but thick and without wings
[3:54:26] <knomad2b> wow
[3:54:28] <+Dimfish> *beat
[3:54:29] <thisisacoolguy> Deepnest one is a flame wtf chat
[3:54:33] <%jiin6> did he become a Smash Player now?
[3:54:37] <thisisacoolguy> you just don't have to fight to get it
[3:54:38] <%TheImmortal70> Lookit our child
[3:54:39] <xeros720> pat, fuck up grimm troupe
[3:54:40] <%Rostichenburg> @AngriestPat Go through the roof of Grimm's tent
[3:54:41] <Flyrant> yeah deepnest one still counts
[3:54:42] <$Mendin> Hey pat do you have a timestop pin down in the bottom of deepnest?
[3:54:44] <+tehbuu> chat relax
[3:54:45] <bliksnort> I always thought he was a Calyptra. Vampire moth.
[3:54:48] <Theoyveyman> DEEPNEST FLAME=BAD END
[3:54:48] <%TheImmortal70> I feed my son flame and he grow big and strong
[3:54:54] <Tisaric> Damn I didn't realize he found nearly every charm
[3:54:54] <DivineDragoonKain> No
[3:54:54] <$shadow1man9> Compass?
[3:54:55] <Kghaleon> Stop spoiling
[3:54:55] <thisisacoolguy> No it's not
[3:54:56] <%Piemen99> THE NEW BABY WIL GROW BIG AND STRONG
[3:54:56] <Zanicedg> @AngriestPat There is one more charm notch in fog canyon.
[3:54:58] <+JustToWatch> @AngriestPat getting the one in deepnest doesn't lock you in to an ending, but NOT getting it will. That one gives you a decesion
[3:54:58] <%stigna1> So, the thoery is that Grimm is a vampire moth.
[3:54:58] <cerberuscarmine> pat fuck things up super hard
[3:55:00] <SaltBuster> compass and swarm?
[3:55:00] <cerberuscarmine> do it
[3:55:00] <DivineDragoonKain> you can get the deepnest flame and it's fine
[3:55:00] <$magikestral> compass
[3:55:06] <%Kuro_Koshka> Deepnest Flame gives you an option select
[3:55:06] <DivineDragoonKain> just don't do what the guy says
[3:55:08] <%TheImmortal70> Grimm being a vampire moth makes a lot of sense
[3:55:10] <%Piemen99> FEED NEW BABY PAT
[3:55:14] <thisisacoolguy> I got the deepnest flame and just chose not to do that quest chat, c'mon --
[3:55:15] <%TheImmortal70> Bugs are weird
[3:55:15] <thetechnicalraven> @bliksnort That makes a lot more sense
[3:55:17] <Flyrant> deepnest flame does not equal bad end, you have a choice to make
[3:55:18] <$magikestral> no need for swarm since money is only for divine
[3:55:19] <%Rostichenburg> It makes sense with the Moths connection to dreams
[3:55:21] <knomad2b> @Tisaric ye chat helped a bunch but still
[3:55:33] <%Kirijuo> @an
[3:55:39] <Theoyveyman> wait Grimm being a moth would mean...

[3:56:19] <Tisaric> FINISH DEEPNEST
[3:56:19] <Eresus> leave dreamer in deepnest for the last
[3:56:20] <Donchalant402> Fog Canyon is the next real point of progress, since there is another zone beyond it
[3:56:24] <%TheImmortal70> @angriestpat You are like five steps ahead of dreamers
[3:56:25] <knomad2b> killed him with the base nail. it was so hard
[3:56:27] <+Bt_Robot> DEEPNEST IS A GOOD START TO A LINE, A TRAM LINE
[3:56:29] <%Divryne> Lies.
[3:56:31] <+Rose_Inko> BEEEEEES
[3:56:33] <+Dimfish> hive could or potentially fog canyon if you wanna progress some
[3:56:39] <+Dimfish> or more kingdoms edge
[3:56:39] <%AlfredoCavatelli> pat you can go through shadowgates now
[3:56:41] <$shadow1man9> @AngriestPat You can do the Deepnest Dreamer now
[3:56:44] <+Crows_feet> Dirtmouth's music sure loses a lot of ambiance with Zote yapping
[3:56:47] <Hydrapissed> !uptime
[3:56:47] <@Moobot> I've been playing this game for how long? Oh only 3h 56m 49s.
[3:56:50] <ekkieekk> Deepnest for the flame and dreamer @AngriestPat
[3:56:51] <PettyFunk> Fog Canyon has big powerup and leads to another zone
[3:56:52] <X3nobro> nap time
[3:56:52] <leole11> DO WHATEVER YOU WANT
[3:56:53] <thisisacoolguy> You can get the flame in distant village, just don't do the quest tied to it otherwise you lock yourself out of the best boss in the game
[3:56:56] <Flyrant> killing the dreamer will let you get the bad ending right now, if you want to get all 3 endings
[3:56:56] <+korth367> u do u pat
[3:56:56] <zaiwolfgang> Bees
[3:56:58] <Tampaoster> Kairos fateweaver chat mode on
[3:57:00] <nexoosen> everywhere is some form of progress so you can go anywhere/do anything
[3:57:02] <$magikestral> the reason to leave deepnest for last is already past.
[3:57:03] <Flyrant> but it won't force you
[3:57:04] <$Mendin> @AngriestPat There's an optional timestop by deepnest's hot springs that you'd probably enjoy
[3:57:05] <DivineDragoonKain> If you want to get ending #1 go ahead and hit the dreamers
[3:57:05] <%TheImmortal70> @flyrant what hte fuck?
[3:57:06] <ukokira> Why does Pat need to wait? Did he fight that boss a second time? He can do it now if he wants if he did
[3:57:07] <+JustToWatch> lol
[3:57:07] <+Puppet88> follow your heart pat!
[3:57:09] <%TheImmortal70> @flyrant You are BLATANTLY lying
[3:57:11] <Hydrapissed> HELL YEAH time to kill some dreams
[3:57:13] <DivineDragoonKain> you can come back and do the others after
[3:57:14] <Eresus> there is extra lore if you leave the dreamer in deepest for last
[3:57:18] <ekkieekk> hes sick of the dreamers because theyre giving it out for free
[3:57:18] <%TheImmortal70> Dreamers are required for all endings
[3:57:20] <%Kirijuo> @AngriestPat Grimm was made to be post game or during so theres no harm in doing either
[3:57:22] <Borealum_EX> @AngriestPat do fog canyon first you can progress with you dark dash
[3:57:27] <Donchalant402> no reason to
[3:57:28] <$magikestral> you'll see
[3:57:28] <bambowl> clap its cheeks pat
[3:57:28] <ValidVenasaur> it doesnt matter
[3:57:30] <%mattmanj17> there is extra lore you can get depoending when you kill the dreamer in deepnest. you HAVE fullfilled the requirements though, so you WILL see the extra lore
[3:57:31] <dekkitout> "leave deepnest to me"
[3:57:32] <thisisacoolguy> There's no reason pat
[3:57:32] <$SGrim> I'm not. Now is good.
[3:57:33] <Tisaric> Yeah you can make sure to get ending 1 if you finish up the dreamers
[3:57:34] <+Bt_Robot> LORE REASONS
[3:57:35] <%Divryne> It doesn't matter people are picky.
[3:57:36] <Donchalant402> you can do it now
[3:57:36] <ekkieekk> go into the small room
[3:57:37] <%Kuro_Koshka> Deepnest is fine people being dumb
[3:57:38] <%tehbuu> just do it
[3:57:39] <Flyrant> @TheImmortal70 no I'm not, it will allow him access to the bad ending if he want it now. He will be cut off from it if he gets a certain item
[3:57:44] <Donchalant402> dont listen to chat, chat is dumb
[3:57:45] <%mattmanj17> there is extra lore you can get depoending when you kill the dreamer in deepnest. you HAVE fullfilled the requirements though, so you WILL see the extra lore @AngriestPat
[3:57:45] <ukokira> Everyone tell Pat to open his charms
[3:57:47] <Zanicedg> You should wait until you beat hornet twice.
[3:57:47] <%tehbuu> it will be a big revelaiton
[3:57:50] <ukokira> We can see i-
[3:57:51] <$magikestral> go into the smaller house for the flame after @angriestpat
[3:57:52] <%TheImmortal70> @flyrant No, you said killing the dreamer will lock him out.
[3:57:53] <Eresus> you get extra lore
[3:57:53] <knomad2b> they are big cowards
[3:57:55] <ekkieekk> small room is the flame
[3:57:56] <ukokira> Wait no his basic inventory
[3:57:56] <LORDSPOOKLEKINS> Extra lore
[3:57:58] <Shastafield> nyah
[3:57:58] <mothdude> He already beat Hornet 2.
[3:58:07] <Zanicedg> Which he already did.
[3:58:07] <%TheImmortal70> @flyrant I know what you're talking about, and it's something so specific that it's not possible to do it without purpose
[3:58:09] <%tehbuu> killing dreamers doesnt lock you out from ANYTHING
[3:58:09] <Flyrant> @TheImmortal70 that is the opposite of what I said
[3:58:10] <CptBritches> B r u m m
[3:58:10] <ukokira> Pat you already beat Hornet twice right?
[3:58:12] <+Bouerd> DO NOT DO THIS
[3:58:12] <$Mendin> Getting the cut-off item is Extremely Involved and he wont accidently cut himself off from it without chat hollering bloody murder so chill out
[3:58:13] <@PlagueOfGripes> that thing is making a lot of Mitty noises
[3:58:27] <ukokira> Jeez people misunderstand a lot in this game
[3:58:28] <%Sirculbs> @angriestpat Did you ever dream nail that bug at the bottom of this place that keeps trying to eat you?
[3:58:29] <ekkieekk> He is the option for cowards who arent good enough to beat grimm troupe @AngriestPat
[3:58:41] <%TheImmortal70> @flyrant Alright I can see where the mistake is. The wording is fucking weird
[3:58:43] <Donchalant402> @AngriestPat this is your optional ending to this quest for if you're too pussy to beat the final boss of this quest so you can still get 100% without getting your balls smashed in
[3:58:44] <AtlasMcCoy> DO NOT
[3:58:45] <knomad2b> ur son grows stronger
[3:58:45] <ukokira> Or has no need for Grimmchild
[3:58:47] <Mesonoxian_Methuselah> don't do this quest ending if you don't want to screw yourself out of a boss fight
[3:58:54] <+JustToWatch> yep
[3:58:54] <cerberuscarmine> do it
[3:58:57] <$magikestral> that's exactly it
[3:58:58] <Hydrapissed> Cowards way out f that
[3:58:59] <%Kuro_Koshka> It's an option you can take the flame and still do the fight
[3:58:59] <%mattmanj17> yup. brumm for cowards
[3:59:00] <$SGrim> Well, Pat is a coward
[3:59:00] <Hydrapissed> GO SLAM THE KING
[3:59:02] <ukokira> He’s not screwing himself out of a boss fight
[3:59:05] <Zanicedg> Complete the ritual.
[3:59:07] <%TheImmortal70> @angriest You have a choice between two endings
[3:59:08] <Aixenn> Pat confrimed Coward
[3:59:11] <ukokira> He can still fight that boss since Godmaster came out today
[3:59:11] <%edwardskacz> you get the best boss if you ignore this dude
[3:59:18] <knomad2b> dammit
[3:59:19] <%ArcanumMBD> @AngriestPat Or you can back up your save and do both. This ending has a cool thing to it, but it's definitely the lesser option
[3:59:19] <Hydrapissed> Better not be PUSS PUSS
[3:59:22] <Tisaric> I accidentally did it without knowing what it did
[3:59:22] <pede2011> PUSSIES UNITE, FUCK NKG
[3:59:23] <ukokira> And Godmaster lets you fight the boss even if you did this ending
[3:59:24] <thisisacoolguy> You lock yourself out of a good charm and a good boss
[3:59:29] <Donchalant402> You can NOT get both endings in one playthrough, each end gets you another charm
[3:59:30] <%tehbuu> hit the deepnest dreamer now?
[3:59:32] <%tehbuu> woo
[3:59:32] <Kghaleon> Taking his path will get you a charm that gives you near invincibility
[3:59:33] <cerberuscarmine> you get a good boi if you go with that dood
[3:59:37] <%Kahnicus> See, that's the thing about Dwarves, they've got stone balls.
[3:59:43] <+Dimfish> NKG is way better than that pussy ass bitch
[3:59:47] <ekkieekk> If you do his quest then the baby will be sad
[3:59:47] <Donchalant402> that charm you get from his path is shit
[3:59:50] <+JustToWatch> remember how blindly he walked into this?
[3:59:52] <Donchalant402> dont listen to chat
[3:59:55] <+Ciphris> wait why didn't he hit the dreamer if he went this far into it
[3:59:58] <Kghaleon> His charm is mad good.
[3:59:58] <Hydrapissed> its a poop charm go slam the king
[4:00:01] <%TheImmortal70> He didn't have dream nail
[4:00:04] <%Rostichenburg> Did Pat ever meet the mask maker?
[4:00:06] <knomad2b> well good thing there's a ng plus then i guess
[4:00:06] <%TheImmortal70> The man made it through DeepNest with only dash
[4:00:08] <mothdude> He didn't even talk to the people before sitting the on bench.
[4:00:10] <$magikestral> @ciphris went before the nail
[4:00:11] <Donchalant402> @Rostichenburg no
[4:00:11] <%TheImmortal70> Err wall climb
[4:00:13] <Tisaric> He came here before dreamnail
[4:00:17] <AtlasMcCoy> PAT'S ARCHENEMY
[4:00:19] <ukokira> @angriestpat todays update lets you still fight the boss so you can do this ending if you want. It honestly just depends on wether you like Grimmchild or want to replace him
[4:00:20] <%tehbuu> @Ciphris i think chat told him to lay off because lore? but hes ready
[4:00:20] <nexoosen> @Rostichenburg he has not yet explored that part of deepnest
[4:00:21] <Flyrant> wow I didn't even know you could make it here without the dream nail
[4:00:26] <CptBritches> Your son is helping!
[4:00:27] <Donchalant402> what a gud boi
[4:00:33] <%tehbuu> hit dat grubby lady

[4:05:05] <$awsomesaucekirby> f******K
[4:05:06] <$Smolkupo> Bro I would LOVE a Hornet DLC
[4:05:10] <Tisaric> I'm pretty sure it's just last free
[4:05:10] <$Smolkupo> That would be amazing
[4:05:11] <+Gorgen> when do you fuck Zote
[4:05:16] <$awsomesaucekirby> wanted tab, hit enter
[4:05:17] <%ThatGuyfromMars> @cerberuscarmine don't lie to me son
[4:05:18] <Tisaric> Hornet is coming but is paid
[4:05:18] <leole11> Zote's Magnificent Quest Dlc When
[4:05:19] <%stigna1> @Smolkupo Well, I HAVE GOOD NEWS FOR YOU! They're working on it.
[4:05:19] <$Mendin> Oh yeah the good stuff
[4:05:20] <knomad2b> yeh the rest of the dlc is paid
[4:05:23] <%TheImmortal70> Almost everybody will want to see everything this game has to offer
[4:05:24] <mothdude> If you wanted playable Zote ya shoulda donated more to the kickstarter.
[4:05:26] <$Smolkupo> Sweet
[4:05:26] <%Rostichenburg> Let's go bees
[4:05:26] <Mesonoxian_Methuselah> the crossroads already became infected when he beat the broken vessel, chill out guys
[4:05:28] <cerberuscarmine> zote best romance option
[4:05:29] <%tehbuu> chat!! get him to look at the crossroads now its gonna be great
[4:05:31] <knomad2b> consider this the full base game
[4:05:35] <$shadow1man9> @AngriestPat Fog Canyon is probably where you should head after you do Flame stuff
[4:05:35] <pede2011> With the addition of this last DLC, the 100% is actually 112%
[4:05:37] <%TheImmortal70> Was there seriously a Zote campaign for more money?
[4:05:39] <%ThatGuyfromMars> @mothdude IF I KNEW ABOUT IT I WOULD
[4:05:39] <+Bt_Robot> LTERALLY LEFT THE PLACE HE NEEDED TO BE
[4:05:39] <Donchalant402> @AngriestPat can you IMAGINE how annoying exploring is late game without the dreamgate and the hidden station? Endgame was a nightmare in vanilla.
[4:05:40] <$magikestral> @tehbuu he knows its infected
[4:05:43] <+Dimfish> i'll happily pay more for this masterpiece
[4:05:44] <%stigna1> @tehbuu He already did the thing to the crossroads, no difference now.
[4:05:44] <ShawnEXE> I'll happily pay for hornet DLC, this game is worth at least 40 bucks
[4:05:48] <$awsomesaucekirby> Prepare to Hiiii
[4:05:48] <Flyrant> lol what would playable zote be? You can't kill anything and die?
[4:05:51] <%tehbuu> aw nuts nvm
[4:05:54] <%Falilth> @AngriestPat CHECK WOOLIES TWEET ABOUT G BEING Q
[4:05:56] <%ThatGuyfromMars> @TheImmortal70 yeah it was a stretch goal that wasn't reached
[4:05:59] <cerberuscarmine> its his quest to git gud
[4:06:02] <+Dimfish> its criminal that this game is only 10 to 15 dollars
[4:06:04] <nexoosen> maybe zotes rise to power
[4:06:04] <+Gorgen> Zote DLC should be like Journey
[4:06:04] <cerberuscarmine> BY BEING THE BEST
[4:06:10] <%TheImmortal70> I can't even imagine
[4:06:11] <Tisaric> Yeah vanilla was almost a completely different game
[4:06:13] <cerberuscarmine> CANT STOP ZOTE
[4:06:13] <leole11> you get into fights, fail, and then insult them until you mr. magoo your way to victory
[4:06:14] <%tehbuu> its criminal that this game is on sale now
[4:06:18] <SaltBuster> Play as Dream Zote :P
[4:06:18] <knomad2b> it's 10 rn on switch
[4:06:21] <$Tredecian> @Flyrant YES a steelsoul playthrough with a stick
[4:06:24] <%Remery_> Zote DLC is just him sleeping on the toilet
[4:06:25] <%Rostichenburg> Zote DLC would be like Spelunker mode in 3d Dot Game Heores
[4:06:29] <Flyrant> haha that would be awesome
[4:06:30] <mothdude> This game has an absurd amount of content.
[4:06:34] <%ArcanumMBD> Zote DLC should put a filter on the game so you can see the world through Zote's eyes
[4:06:35] <%TheImmortal70> Zote dlc seems like it would be something in his mind
[4:06:35] <Theoyveyman> Zote dlc should be a stealth game where you get one shot
[4:06:38] <%tehbuu> its like 1 am, gnite east coast
[4:06:40] <+TheoShodi> a flying pider?
[4:06:40] <knomad2b> iplan on getting every dlc i can. i wanna support this masterpiece
[4:06:41] <AtlasMcCoy> Tram has a bench btw
[4:06:49] <Zanicedg> Where is he going?
[4:06:52] <SaltBuster> Flames
[4:06:59] <Zanicedg> Oh.
[4:06:59] <$Tredecian> @knomad2b every dlc has been free so far
[4:07:00] <%Rostichenburg> Flame ... dear flame
[4:07:02] <+Jaysky> All DLC is free though
[4:07:03] <%Divryne> !uptime
[4:07:04] <@Moobot> I've been playing this game for how long? Oh only 4h 7m 5s.
[4:07:05] <%TheImmortal70> @knomad2b I hate to break it to you, but everything is free. You can't pay them any more than 10 bucks.
[4:07:11] <cerberuscarmine> zote dlc is the base game but you one shot everything
[4:07:12] <SaltBuster> Like Moths... Drawn to the Flame.
[4:07:15] <cerberuscarmine> cuz your zote
[4:07:17] <%TheImmortal70> You can't give more money to the devs
[4:07:19] <+leomc2> whya pat trying to take on nkg this early on in game
[4:07:20] <+Jaysky> You could purchase the soundtrack though
[4:07:20] <%Rostichenburg> Hornet DLC might be paid
[4:07:20] <+Bt_Robot> YOU STILL HAVEN'T CLEARED OUT THE TOP LEFT OF ANCINT BASIN.
[4:07:21] <Flyrant> I think the game is 15 now on steam
[4:07:22] <%ArcanumMBD> Oh man, Zote DLC where you do sick awesome boss fights and then this shitty scrub knight comes in from offscreen and lands the killing blow
[4:07:23] <%stigna1> They already made DLC for stuff they did not reach stretch goals for; the actual game was so wildly successful it made up for an imperfect kickstarter. So there's hope of zote DLC, but no certainties.
[4:07:23] <%TheImmortal70> That's so fuckin weird to say
[4:07:23] <+BurncoatRapscallion> Wait, he didn't get the Distant village flame?
[4:07:23] <%ThatGuyfromMars> you can buy the soundtrack
[4:07:24] <CptBritches> Whoa
[4:07:34] <Zanicedg> @ThatGuyfromMars Yes.
[4:07:34] <$awsomesaucekirby> cheer232 I hit enter, i meant to hit tab, sorry I'm late again, how're you on completing the hunter's journal?
[4:07:38] <AtlasMcCoy> WELCOME TO SUFFERING
[4:07:41] <cerberuscarmine> game is on sale right now
[4:07:44] <cerberuscarmine> buy it nerds!
[4:07:46] <knomad2b> @Tredecian @TheImmortal70 this is the lst free dlc. hornet will cost money and any oter future stuff will too
[4:07:46] <MainMan_Jonadiah> Oh god, I come in to find THESE fuckers
[4:07:47] <%TheImmortal70> Three free dlcs doesn't seem like a unsuccessful kickstarter
[4:07:49] <Hunk_Of_Dunk> I think they said they'll probably(??) have the hornet DLC be paid for non-backers? as far as I know
[4:07:50] <Tisaric> I'm pretty sure they've confirmed Hornet DLC is paid
[4:07:52] <SevenVileEyes> zote dlc everything one shots you
[4:07:54] <Futuretimetraveller> Stable footing to your right, Pat
[4:07:57] <wired_soul> ehehehe ohohoho
[4:07:58] <%stigna1> This scarlet creature is a Grimmkin Nightmare: "Terrifying nightmare spirit of the Grimm Troupe. As part of the Ritual, it gathers scarlet flame within its torch. It will relinquish the flame once defeated. Dance and die and live forever Silent voices shout and sing Stand before the Troupe's dark heart Burn Away the Nightmare King - "The Grimm Troupe""
[4:07:59] <Donchalant402> @AngriestPat for comparison's sake you now do about 31 damage, starting damage was 5
[4:08:00] <%TheImmortal70> @knomad2b They announced Hornet's as free

[4:08:50] <$awsomesaucekirby> can't tell if I want to play the game alongside him, or work on my first ever campaign.
[4:08:51] <MyNameIsRasus> Grimmbaby
[4:08:53] <Zanicedg> @AngriestPat Go to bottom right of deepnest for good charm.
[4:08:56] <%ThatGuyfromMars> THIS GAME IS SO FUCKING GOOD
[4:08:56] <nexus152> !uptime
[4:08:56] <@Moobot> I've been playing this game for how long? Oh only 4h 8m 58s.
[4:09:01] <%Rostichenburg> You can destroy those speakers but they don't come back
[4:09:05] <nexus152> I'VE MISSED SO MUCH!
[4:09:07] <CptBritches> B E E S
[4:09:15] <captainofcosmos> HIVE TIME
[4:09:16] <%TheImmortal70> BEE
[4:09:17] <$awsomesaucekirby> NOT THE BEES
[4:09:17] <+Rose_Inko> yaaay beees
[4:09:19] <MyNameIsRasus> N O T T H E B E E S
[4:09:19] <cerberuscarmine> BEEES

[4:09:20] <mothdude> BEEEEEEESSSS
[4:09:20] <Hunk_Of_Dunk> BUZZ BUZZ MOTHERFUCKER
[4:09:21] <knomad2b> @TheImmortal70 thats amazing then,
[4:09:22] <Zanicedg> Take your time.
[4:09:22] <cerberuscarmine> get paige!
[4:09:22] <%AbnormalVoid> bUrself
[4:09:22] <MainMan_Jonadiah> Bees?!
[4:09:23] <%Kahnicus> Lucky Spikes
[4:09:23] <+Gorgen> BEEHAVE CHAT
[4:09:23] <+NWR_James> BEADS?
[4:09:25] <wsintai> Make sure to "bee" safe Pat
[4:09:25] <CptBritches> NIC CAGE TIME
[4:09:26] <%Remery_> BEE GIRLS <3
[4:09:26] <%TheImmortal70> FUCKIN FIGHT THOSE BEES
[4:09:26] <$magikestral> bees should be easy now
[4:09:28] <+JustToWatch> goof luck with that
[4:09:28] <cerberuscarmine> WAKE HER UP
[4:09:29] <+TheoShodi> NOT THE BEES!
[4:09:31] <+seaearthandsky> good thing paige isn't here
[4:09:32] <%PatNTheHat> *insert Nicholas Cage gif*
[4:09:34] <$awsomesaucekirby> BEEle\ieve in yourself
[4:09:34] <ekkieekk> i cant beeleive you pat
[4:09:39] <%TheImmortal70> How scary are huge bees? Not at all because you can SHOOT them
[4:09:46] <AtlasMcCoy> @AngriestPat Money might be useless, but think about this. You could have MORE MONEY
[4:09:48] <%TheImmortal70> Same thing with huge spiders
[4:09:48] <Donchalant402> its only useless if you dont want to upgrade the fragile charms
[4:09:51] <%TheImmortal70> Just blow those fuckers up
[4:09:51] <+Dimfish> its useless until the next dlc oeOEOowoOOeoeOEOeOW
[4:09:51] <ekkieekk> bee pun chat mode activate
[4:09:51] <alcors_wisdom> you can still buy another heart piece
[4:09:53] <CptBritches> Paige should be here for this
[4:09:53] <+Rose_Inko> I loved seeing the bee zone before, because it looks so... neat.
[4:09:54] <%stigna1> Hollow Knight's take on beez is my fav. Beez are so often played up on their "hivemind" aspect, but HK realizes the nobility bees have. The Hibe is truely breathtaking, and the characters here are fantastic.
[4:09:54] <dekkitout> those damn bees, always with their god save the queen and whatnot
[4:09:55] <MyNameIsRasus> This area's all the buzz with the young'uns
[4:09:56] <cerberuscarmine> :D
[4:10:02] <+Bt_Robot> YOU STILL NEED 21K TO GET ALL CHARMS
[4:10:05] <Zanicedg> These bee puns don't BEElong here.
[4:10:06] <$magikestral> @donchalant402 even still, you can just grind the colloseum for that
[4:10:07] <$awsomesaucekirby> shoot the bees, they're just robot sex dolls in disguise!
[4:10:17] <mothdude> Good ol' useless useless money.
[4:10:19] <MainMan_Jonadiah> Everyone making Nic Cage jokes, while me and NWR_James, are on that next level Arrested Development shit!
[4:10:20] <%Rostichenburg> The bees love the light though those stupid traitors
[4:10:20] <%PatNTheHat> Would you rather fight a tiger sized bees, or a hundred bee sized tigers?
[4:10:20] <+Dimfish> IT FEELS GOOD TO PICK UP MONEY
[4:10:21] <%TheImmortal70> Make them go extinct FASTER
[4:10:36] <cerberuscarmine> AWW YE
[4:10:37] <AtlasMcCoy> Also, if you havent gotten the last charm notch from salubra, thats like 1500 or something
[4:10:39] <+Gorgen> i hate it when money in games becomes useless after a point
[4:10:40] <%Remery_> sticky bench
[4:10:42] <cerberuscarmine> the greatest prize of all
[4:10:43] <MyNameIsRasus> This area has me beewildered
[4:10:44] <%stigna1> Hive Soldier: Defends The Hive against intruders with its extendable stinger. Savage and dedicated warriors. Be prepared to fight them to the death if you plan on invading their home.
[4:10:50] <Flyrant> hundred bee sized tigers easy
[4:10:52] <%Rostichenburg> I think its just Salubra's blessing left
[4:10:53] <Kghaleon> If he finishes the Troupe dlc, I think he loses access to the upgrades
[4:10:55] <nexus152> just got here, does he know what ending to go for for grimm troupe?
[4:10:56] <$magikestral> this is all dlc @angriestpat
[4:10:57] <+BurncoatRapscallion> There's a lot of buzz about this area
[4:10:59] <$awsomesaucekirby> wait, what, i didnt know that bench was there!
[4:11:00] <Hunk_Of_Dunk> They revamped how this area looks in an update
[4:11:02] <wsintai> @Gorgen Assassin's Creed 2 apologizes
[4:11:04] <%TheImmortal70> Tigers are just cats, so smaller cats are just easy
[4:11:06] <%Rostichenburg> @AngriestPat You still need 800 for Salubra's blessing
[4:11:08] <$Tredecian> @Kghaleon he doesnt
[4:11:08] <leole11> The hive isn't dlc
[4:11:09] <Hunk_Of_Dunk> @magikestral This area isn't DLC, but they did upgrade how it looks
[4:11:10] <Zanicedg> @Kghaleon He doesn't.
[4:11:13] <%ArcanumMBD> @PatNTheHat Bee-sized tigers. I don't want to think what stinger venom of a Tiger-sized Bee would do to me
[4:11:13] <ekkieekk> the boss of this area is dlc
[4:11:17] <%stigna1> And the chubby gguys are Husk Hives: "Cowardly husk, its body colonised by hivelings. Did the hivelings build their nest around this sorry bug, or did the bug squeeze its body into their nest? Either way, they seem happy enough together."
[4:11:18] <+Dimfish> that bee makes car noises
[4:11:21] <NaderShahDidNothingWrong> Use money to buy rotten eggs, to recover your lost money, to buy more eggs.
[4:11:21] <%Kirijuo> Pat's already in the Hive, I can't beelieve it
[4:11:21] <Donchalant402> @AngriestPat SPIRIT TREE BELOW YOU
[4:11:23] <%edwardskacz> there's an essence tree in this room
[4:11:25] <$shadow1man9> @AngriestPat Just passed an essence tree
[4:11:30] <scrumdrew> @AngriestPat fun fact they completely redid this area in lifeblood because it was kinda not a great area originally
[4:11:34] <MyNameIsRasus> This are isn't DLC, it's BEE LC
[4:11:43] <reonome> bUrself bUrself bUrself bUrself
[4:11:45] <$awsomesaucekirby> these bees shall peirce the heavens!
[4:11:45] <Flyrant> I loved discovering this area, it's crazy how much content is in this game
[4:11:49] <+deacon1621> oh man, Paige is going to hate this!
[4:11:57] <%stigna1> Yeah, what was it like originally? I started because of Woolie.
[4:12:00] <AtlasMcCoy> What is?
[4:12:00] <+JustToWatch> no
[4:12:00] <Donchalant402> ye
[4:12:07] <MyNameIsRasus> Giga Drill Beereaker
[4:12:14] <%Kirijuo> BEELIEVE
[4:12:15] <+Bt_Robot> NO. THEY PUT IT ON YOUR MAP
[4:12:18] <scrumdrew> it had basically nothing in it
[4:12:23] <%Rostichenburg> This area is way too hidden
[4:12:25] <ekkieekk> you should leave this area and come back next time paige is here
[4:12:34] <nexoosen> there are a few hints that its here
[4:12:35] <Donchalant402> I COMPLETELY missed this place before I killed the final boss
[4:12:37] <AtlasMcCoy> There's something you get that makes you need to go in this direction and find a hidden wall
[4:12:38] <%stigna1> @Bt_Robot Only because Pat was already here, because we told him about the secret wall. Its pretty sneaky.
[4:12:39] <%Rostichenburg> Dream Nail that tree Pat
[4:12:47] <+Ciphris> i found it cause of a pick up i got from a boss
[4:12:55] <mothdude> There's another way in that serves as a preview since it's like one room long.
[4:13:01] <%PatNTheHat> Dream Nail EVERYTHING
[4:13:03] <Flyrant> he did
[4:13:04] <MyNameIsRasus> By all laws of modern avionics, there is no way a bee could fly.
[4:13:04] <Zanicedg> Don't bother.
[4:13:10] <$Tredecian> extra lore on trees
[4:13:11] <+Ciphris> dreamnail it again
[4:13:14] <$magikestral> if you nail it again, it gives lore
[4:13:16] <parker_said> Hey Pat just wanted to let you know that i am loving your Let's Play of Banner Saga!
[4:13:19] <zal_silverfang> "I love the fact that money no longer has any use" - goes for money anyways
[4:13:28] <nexoosen> you can dream nail grown trees for lore, but its generally nothing of importance
[4:13:31] <+Ciphris> everyone still wants dosh
[4:13:32] <+Gorgen> so informative
[4:13:34] <knomad2b> must get the shiny
[4:13:34] <+Bt_Robot> @stigna1 HE CAN ALSO NAIL A WALL IN KINGDOM'S EDGE AND SEE IT
[4:13:35] <MainMan_Jonadiah> "Go back Pat, you missed 4 words."
[4:13:35] <cerberuscarmine> lookit all the smol bees
[4:13:38] <Flyrant> well he can still get the other unbreakables
[4:13:44] <$Mendin> Turn off your caps lock
[4:13:47] <+Corvax__> i dont think they are infected
[4:13:48] <cerberuscarmine> BIG BOI
[4:13:51] <$Mendin> And t hen your monitor
[4:13:54] <%TheImmortal70> Given the path Pat is taking he can get the Unbreakables any time
[4:13:55] <%stigna1> "Light familiar" is pretty interesting, given what we know about the light. My take was they they ARE infected (hence the husks around) but because they are hive-minded and strong willed they don't succum to the madness of infection.
[4:13:55] <CptBritches> GOOD BOY
[4:13:56] <cerberuscarmine> medium boi
[4:13:57] <Flyrant> big damage
[4:13:57] <Zanicedg> @zal_silverfang Any gamer would feel wrong leaving money on the ground.
[4:13:59] <SatansDick1> bees are cute
[4:14:01] <MyNameIsRasus> Bee g bee
[4:14:02] <%Rostichenburg> No they are but they love being infected
[4:14:04] <+ShinyMonger> Big Bee had Big Damage
[4:14:07] <cerberuscarmine> i love bees
[4:14:08] <drfaustisdead> @AngriestPat would you say that Hollow Knight might be one of the best Kickstarter games released so far?
[4:14:10] <%Kahnicus> Homing bees are terrifying
[4:14:10] <+leomc2> @mainman_jonadiah but those 4 words may vaguely hint at maybe some story lol
[4:14:17] <%stigna1> The huge bees are called Hive Guardians. "Protects The Hive by hurling its huge body at intruders. Like their smaller kin, their only instinct is to protect The Hive at any cost to themselves. Somewhat clumsy, they'll often damage the structure of The Hive when charging at intruders. Does this cause them shame? I do not know whether they have the capacity for such a thing"
[4:14:17] <+TheoShodi> the bees are in the HUGE GUEST?
[4:14:20] <+Gorgen> Eat their honey and die
[4:14:20] <+baseball7000> So what's the buzz on this zone?
[4:14:22] <+ozzyzak> i like yellowjackets :3
[4:14:23] <knomad2b> yes
[4:14:25] <CptBritches> My ex-girlfriend was named Bee, true story
[4:14:27] <Donchalant402> the enemies in the area are really annoying
[4:14:28] <+Dimfish> some species are just happier as a hive i suppose
[4:14:32] <MainMan_Jonadiah> @leomc2 Good enough for me!
[4:14:32] <+BurncoatRapscallion> Would you rather have a 100 bee sized dogs or one dog sized bee?
[4:14:38] <knomad2b> i'd say this and shovel knight are my faves
[4:14:39] <MyNameIsRasus> He said that
[4:14:41] <%ThatGuyfromMars> but is it better than shovel knight?
[4:14:41] <+Jaysky> Undoubtedly
[4:14:43] <%TheImmortal70> Hollow Knight might be the best.
[4:14:44] <AtlasMcCoy> You did
[4:14:47] <nexoosen> @stigna1 I always thought they were super chill about being infected because everything infected is just becoming one big hive mind
[4:14:48] <+JustToWatch> we did
[4:14:50] <cerberuscarmine> and of course might number 9 AM I RITE LADS
[4:14:52] <Tisaric> someone had asked in a dono
[4:14:54] <DivineDragoonKain> The big ol boy bees can break cracked hive walls that you can't
[4:14:55] <nexus152> is pat going to fight the second boss in the grimm dlc, or is he doing the other ending?
[4:14:55] <%TheImmortal70> The amount of content to cost at this point is too high not to be
[4:14:59] <zal_silverfang> @Zanicedg oh dont get me wrong, i understand cause i would do it too. i just find it as an interesting testiment to just how wired long time gamers have gotten hen it comes to picking up shiny
[4:14:59] <MyNameIsRasus> We did
[4:14:59] <$magikestral> we did, and its still true
[4:15:03] <%TheImmortal70> And the consistency makes it go WAY UP
[4:15:08] <+Gorgen> I did :)
[4:15:18] <+Dimfish> i'd say hollow knights the best kickstarter game so far. I love undertale and shovel knight but this game just jives with me
[4:15:20] <undeuxtroisqua> Honestly its way above any of those. Hollow Knight really set up the bar
[4:15:22] <cerberuscarmine> im joking btw fuck might 9
[4:15:23] <Flyrant> hollow knight is crazy good, better than a lot of AAA games
[4:15:24] <+ozzyzak> this game is getting a physical edition on Switch isn't it? I think I read that somewhere...
[4:15:24] <Kghaleon> I wonder when we'll get the Paige LP
[4:15:26] <%Rostichenburg> The light makes things hive minded but the bees already are and also they're day bugs
[4:15:27] <%stigna1> @nexoosen Sorta...There are non-Light bees though, that have thoughts and conciousness and stuff though. They have their own hive mind that superseeds that the light.
[4:15:29] <+Kennentebest> patt re6 when
[4:15:33] <MainMan_Jonadiah> "Our tiny Bee-thrones!"
[4:15:37] <%ArcanumMBD> It's a LiBEEary
[4:15:41] <+Jaysky> Hollow Knight go UP, Mighty No. 9 go way doooown
[4:15:44] <nexoosen> huh, weird
[4:15:47] <AtlasMcCoy> SHORTCUT
[4:15:48] <%TheImmortal70> Basically the affliction makes bees more aggressive towards your dumb ass, and that's about it
[4:15:50] <Sol_Install> Tbh this is best just due to the amount of content at the price they're asking too
[4:15:51] <cerberuscarmine> super down
[4:15:53] <Flyrant> easy access get
[4:15:59] <AtlasMcCoy> BOOOOO
[4:16:00] <CptBritches> Good joke
[4:16:01] <%stigna1> I'l BEE apatDab apatDab apatDab
[4:16:02] <nexoosen> ayyyyyyyyy
[4:16:02] <Mesonoxian_Methuselah> I'll BEE
[4:16:03] <+Dimfish> I'll BEEEEEEE???????
[4:16:04] <cerberuscarmine> hat in time is also really good
[4:16:04] <dekkitout> tajF
[4:16:04] <Parapattern> BOOOOOOURNS
[4:16:05] <$magikestral> easier bench than the one in the hice
[4:16:07] <+Kennentebest> give the people what the want patt
[4:16:09] <+JustToWatch> IMO Hollow knight is better than shovel and pillars, undertale doesn't really compare to other things in the same way
[4:16:09] <%TheImmortal70> Hollow Knight might be the most cost effective game
[4:16:14] <%PatNTheHat> HEH
[4:16:16] <cerberuscarmine> aww yee
[4:16:17] <$SGrim> bUrself
[4:16:23] <%skizzuto> Well I’ll BEE
[4:16:23] <nexoosen> definately up there in terms of bang for buck
[4:16:24] <%TheImmortal70> 50 hours content for 10 dollars is kinda hard to beat especially when it's all good
[4:16:24] <+Dimfish> I believe this game had about the same budget as undertale
[4:16:26] <+Dimfish> funnily enough
[4:16:27] <arcaderabbit48> Can you get a bee minion pin???
[4:16:27] <Estuko> @ArcanumMBD LibrarBee?
[4:16:30] <$magikestral> the tram bench is easier to get through the area than the hive one thanks to that shortcut
[4:16:32] <Tisaric> It's pretty damn close to being the best content per dollar
[4:16:35] <%mjkenney24> sorry if i missed it, is re5 final getting reuploaded
[4:16:36] <+leomc2> its a MASTAHPIECE FOR YO WALLET
[4:16:38] <knomad2b> hat in time is great, but i'm not a fan of how they screwed console backrs on patches
[4:16:46] <+TheoShodi> beelieve in yoursefl pat
[4:16:46] <drfaustisdead> Btw @AngriestPat I'm at the tail end of a 12.5 hour shift thanks for keeping me entertained.
[4:16:52] <$awsomesaucekirby> suprised no-one posted a bee movie script yet
[4:16:54] <undeuxtroisqua> oh well thats only because toby fox is a hack
[4:16:58] <%ArcanumMBD> @Estuko book-based bee puns are brutal
[4:16:58] <+Gorgen> HEHEHE
[4:16:59] <AtlasMcCoy> LUL
[4:17:02] <Flyrant> lol
[4:17:05] <DesuDesuDokiDoki> lol
[4:17:05] <CptBritches> lmao
[4:17:06] <MainMan_Jonadiah> Now fight this asshole!
[4:17:07] <+Jaysky> Hatty Time was really fun
[4:17:09] <%stigna1> So, does anyone know what The Hive was like before Lifeblood? I joined the HK train a bit late.
[4:17:12] <thisisacoolguy> Toby Fox is fine lol
[4:17:16] <Tisaric> @knomad2b it more seems like the community manager doesn't know how to PR
[4:17:26] <%ArcanumMBD> wallhacks
[4:17:26] <Estuko> @ArcanumMBD EncycloBEEdia? :D
[4:17:26] <thisisacoolguy> The Hive was the exact same, it just didn't have a boss
[4:17:26] <nexoosen> @knomad2b I dont know anything about hat in time in particular but arent updates on consoles really hard for indie devs to do in general?
[4:17:32] <MainMan_Jonadiah> Man, I forgot how much I love the Nightmare Troupe's music
[4:17:32] <AtlasMcCoy> F
[4:17:32] <Flyrant> damn
[4:17:35] <+Dimfish> big dead
[4:17:35] <+Gorgen> why is he so happy?
[4:17:37] <%PatNTheHat> Wow
[4:17:42] <Estuko> he hurts if you stay ontop of his attacks
[4:17:42] <MyNameIsRasus> We need a picture of Beeil D Grasse Tyson saying "People don't think Hallownest bee like it is but it do"
[4:17:43] <%TheImmortal70> IF content updates were hard for consoles the Switch would be dead
[4:17:45] <AtlasMcCoy> You should overcharm for this fight Kappa
[4:17:46] <asbestosflavored> LUL
[4:17:46] <Tisaric> @stigna1 I don't think the hive bois existed, but it was the same loadout without the boss at the end
[4:17:49] <Flyrant> probably shouldn't stand in fire
[4:17:51] <%kenpachi9211> Death count 82
[4:17:55] <thisisacoolguy> Yeah could you imagine if a boss did 2 damage that would be rough
[4:17:55] <%TheImmortal70> For indies anyways
[4:17:57] <Futuretimetraveller> I gotta turn in for the night. Later Pat and Chat!
[4:17:59] <%stigna1> @Tisaric Thanks!
[4:18:02] <+leomc2> not even flex tape can save you from that damage
[4:18:07] <%stigna1> @Futuretimetraveller G'night!
[4:18:12] <Flyrant> bosses doing 2 damage a hit? Crazy talk
[4:18:12] <CptBritches> No dabs on the death count?
[4:18:15] <%TheImmortal70> @thisisacoolguy The game has repeatable bosses that can go all the way up to five
[4:18:15] <+Bt_Robot> LOOK AT THAT FLAME PYROMANCY THAT THING IS DOING
[4:18:16] <Donchalant402> @AngriestPat I know you found the dream version of the Failed Champion, but you can also do a dream fight for the Soul Master, each is 300 essence a pop
[4:18:18] <+Jaysky> That would never happen in this game thisisacoolguy
[4:18:20] <Futuretimetraveller> <3
[4:18:21] <MainMan_Jonadiah> @thisisacoolguy HAHAHA, That'd be CRAZY!
[4:18:26] <Eresus> @thisisacoolguy and now imagine that overcharmed
[4:18:28] <%stigna1> and its great!
[4:18:28] <+Jaysky> Neeeever
[4:18:30] <Endocrom> Hey, he's still on, no big surprise
[4:18:31] <%theblackgoddess> good
[4:18:32] <cerberuscarmine> its the best
[4:18:36] <SatansDick1> has pat died more times in hollow knight than dark souls
[4:18:36] <MyNameIsRasus> To show you the power of the vessel, I sawed The Knight in half!
[4:18:38] <%ArcanumMBD> @CptBritches did somebody say dabs? apatDab apatDab apatDab apatDab apatDab apatDab apatDab apatDab
[4:18:44] <CptBritches> Awwwww yeahhh
[4:18:47] <+Gorgen> This is gonna bee good
[4:18:50] <%TheImmortal70> @angriestpat It's a game you HAVE to finish. It's just that good
[4:18:51] <ekkieekk> its honestly shocking how much game is in this game
[4:18:52] <%jiin6> Drill bees
[4:18:57] <wsintai> The real Hollow Knight was the mustard Paige drank along the way
[4:18:58] <+korth367> !uptime
[4:18:58] <@Moobot> I've been playing this game for how long? Oh only 4h 19m .
[4:19:00] <knomad2b> there was a stretch goal to have console recive updates at the sametime. the ps4 version a bit of a mess. tho i love the game and own it on pc as well @nexoosen
[4:19:01] <$Mendin> For 10-15 bucks, at that
[4:19:04] <Flyrant> also Zote
[4:19:05] <SevenVileEyes> GETTING WHERE
[4:19:06] <SatansDick1> also dream zote
[4:19:06] <Donchalant402> 1800
[4:19:09] <+Crows_feet> Taking a long flight to Toronto tomorrow and I'm excited to play Godmaster during the trip
[4:19:15] <Flyrant> he can fight zote now as well
[4:19:15] <%TheImmortal70> *Slaps hollow knight* This baby can pack so much bug into it's knight
[4:19:17] <%stigna1> @AngriestPat The other dream fights also give essence (like apatBig Zote)
[4:19:19] <+Bt_Robot> 2400 for the lore
[4:19:20] <+Jaysky> Do you think all this infection is actually just manufactured mustard?
[4:19:21] <demolij> I didn't expect to sink so much time into this game, it was a pleasant surprise
[4:19:39] <$shadow1man9> @AngriestPat There are also 2 dream warriors in Deepnest and Kingdom's Edge
[4:19:42] <AtlasMcCoy> There's also the boss in soul sanctum
[4:19:44] <Donchalant402> do you get essence from big zote?
[4:19:45] <%TheImmortal70> You have about four dream bosses you can do
[4:19:47] <$Mendin> Goddammit Jaysky now I'm imagining fanart of Peach as the final boss
[4:19:48] <MainMan_Jonadiah> How can you forget Zote? He's the best character in the game!
[4:19:52] <nexoosen> @knomad2b yeah, it sucks but that prolly does come down to how hard it is to updatee for indies on console, i only played the pc release version so i was unaware
[4:19:55] <+Corvax__> there's also the white defender if you haven't done that
[4:19:56] <%TheImmortal70> You don't get essence from the recent bosses I don't think
[4:19:58] <%stigna1> 2400 is the big epeen number, for showing off.
[4:19:58] <Flyrant> you get essence from big zote yes
[4:19:58] <Donchalant402> 2400 is just lore, dont bother
[4:20:00] <$Tredecian> 240 is for funsies
[4:20:00] <%TheImmortal70> It needs to be soul bosses
[4:20:02] <%ArcanumMBD> @AngriestPat 2400 for lore. 1800 for the essentials
[4:20:02] <DivineDragoonKain> 2400 is for an extreme cutscene
[4:20:03] <+leomc2> yea i never expected this game to cause me to get super addicted to it and play 24/7 neither @angriestpat this game is just fun
[4:20:04] <+Templar15> 1800 is the "real" requirement
[4:20:05] <DivineDragoonKain> er
[4:20:06] <thisisacoolguy> 1800 is the last needed thing
[4:20:07] <%jiin6> hehe
[4:20:07] <DivineDragoonKain> *extra
[4:20:09] <+AXL808> Is Pat a BIG HUGE?
[4:20:11] <mothdude> I have 3100 essence currently so there's more than enough in the game.
[4:20:13] <+Bt_Robot> only for special lore, not for anything else
[4:20:16] <CptBritches> Lmao
[4:20:21] <%Rostichenburg> Soul Master, Lost Kin and False Knight have bonus bosses
[4:20:21] <Tisaric> I think the Hollow Knight addiction is a common occurance
[4:20:21] <IminyourBase> paige is asleep pat can do whatever he wants
[4:20:23] <AtlasMcCoy> Getting 2400 essence gives you a whole 1% completion bonus though! It's super worth it!
[4:20:25] <Flyrant> shot spells at him pat
[4:20:31] <Flyrant> shoot even
[4:20:33] <CptBritches> Hehehehe
[4:20:35] <Donchalant402> he has a big creeper laugh
[4:20:37] <Donchalant402> eheheheh
[4:20:40] <%Rostichenburg> Fight it on the ground
[4:20:42] <cerberuscarmine> ehhhh hehehehe
[4:20:44] <%jiin6> what a jolly fella
[4:20:45] <MainMan_Jonadiah> Ehehehe
[4:20:45] <+ozzyzak> i love how he wiggles n giggles
[4:20:45] <Tisaric> I'd spend like all day playing when I was still beating it
[4:20:46] <thisisacoolguy> I love that it's the same 3 guys doing all the voices
[4:20:47] <+Jaysky> Hooo hoo hoho ehhh hehehe
[4:20:47] <%stigna1> I love anything called "nightmare" so the fact that this guy is a Grimmkin Nightmare is great.
[4:20:47] <%Higgsworth> apatSmug hey guys
[4:20:47] <Flyrant> don't stand in fire
[4:20:48] <Tomschiii> cant imagine me playing this gsme for more than 20 hrs tbh
[4:20:52] <cerberuscarmine> OOOOH hehehehhe
[4:20:55] <%PatNTheHat> Does this game have a Dark Souls style NG+?
[4:21:01] <%jiin6> spyCappa
[4:21:01] <%Rostichenburg> 2400 is great for the extra lore if you care about that
[4:21:06] <MyNameIsRasus> There's also some other dream boss fights beside Zote, but now I don't know if it would be spoilers if I said who they were
[4:21:08] <Endocrom> Kevin Michael Richardson laugh in here
[4:21:08] <%Rostichenburg> Plus it's pretty easy to get
[4:21:08] <thisisacoolguy> It has something like that PatnTheHat
[4:21:08] <+TheoShodi> spice meat boy slain!
[4:21:13] <SevenVileEyes> does he have the stroger magic charm?
[4:21:15] <%stigna1> @PatNTheHat There's a "Steel mode" where you don't get to respawn. Permadeath.
[4:21:16] <knomad2b> @PatNTheHat yes
[4:21:16] <cerberuscarmine> the child is ready
[4:21:20] <Tisaric> I think they just added NG+?
[4:21:22] <+leomc2> lol everyones talkin about lore this lore that and i completed the game and did almost every single thing for "lore" yet i understood jackshit by the end of it all
[4:21:23] <CptBritches> You feed your son, he will grow stronger
[4:21:27] <$magikestral> finish up the hive first, of course
[4:21:28] <$Mendin> Time to Finish The Ritual
[4:21:29] <Donchalant402> @AngriestPat in the next room you need to make a big bee hit a wall to break it, in front of a mask shard
[4:21:30] <Flyrant> no NG+ but you can continue playing after you beat the game and explore for more stuff, there is also a steel soul mode in which death is permanent
[4:21:34] <%TheImmortal70> @leomc2 Alright what do you not understand
[4:21:34] <%ArcanumMBD> @stigna1 also known as "quit to menu" mode, because that's how i beat it
[4:21:37] <cerberuscarmine> THE LORE
[4:21:44] <%jiin6> aw baby sad apatWink
[4:21:44] <ekkieekk> THE LORE PAT
[4:21:50] <+BurncoatRapscallion> There's no NG+ in Godmaster
[4:21:51] <%TheImmortal70> @leomc2 Actually you know what, I'll just slip into your dms
[4:21:52] <nexoosen> @leomc2 yeah its all a bit obscured and takes a bit of pieceing together
[4:21:53] <cerberuscarmine> SO MUCH BEE LORE
[4:21:53] <$SGrim> @leomc2 but did you look with your eyes on the inside.
[4:21:57] <CptJackySparra> I've not played this game in fucking ages! Great to finally watch you play it Pat!
[4:21:59] <%Rostichenburg> I had to quit to menu for a few of the bosses
[4:22:01] <Tisaric> Ah alright, I was mistaken
[4:22:02] <%jiin6> Yes IGNORE BEE LORE
[4:22:02] <%stigna1> I adore these bees so much, man.
[4:22:05] <MainMan_Jonadiah> YOU FOOL THIS IS HARD PROGRESSION!!!
[4:22:08] <AtlasMcCoy> Did the new dlc add ng+?
[4:22:12] <%Rostichenburg> Mostly Traitor Lord and Watcher Knights
[4:22:18] <Flyrant> I don't think so
[4:22:18] <Donchalant402> to the left is your hint that the zone exists, if you couldnt find the real entrance
[4:22:20] <Mesonoxian_Methuselah> it's a hint
[4:22:27] <CptBritches> Pat's brain falling apart
[4:22:27] <cerberuscarmine> oh
[4:22:34] <cerberuscarmine> huh
[4:22:34] <thisisacoolguy> My death count by the end of my first playthrough was 27. I genuinely do not know but hows pat looking?
[4:22:41] <AtlasMcCoy> Yea I think the only ng+ type thing is the whole permadeath one
[4:22:42] <SatansDick1> buzz
[4:22:44] <Endocrom> EYER!
[4:22:45] <%ArcanumMBD> @AtlasMcCoy No, it didnt. Lots of boss fights
[4:22:47] <MyNameIsRasus> Mark that spot on the map ya dingus
[4:22:49] <ekkieekk> pat hasnt died a single time
[4:22:50] <Flyrant> Pat dies a lot
[4:22:51] <Donchalant402> @AngriestPat leave one big bee alive
[4:22:51] <%stigna1> @thisisacoolguy Around 80 by now. Kenpachiramasama has been keeping track.
[4:22:52] <nexoosen> o man traitor lord is fun

[4:25:07] <neonlightzzz> yakuza kiwami maybe? dmc2 does sound fun too....
[4:25:07] <%drfaustisdead> There's a crazy G an Q relationship theory that was posted on eventhubs about 2 hours ago.
[4:25:07] <ekkieekk> TYRANNY WHEN
[4:25:07] <Tisaric> Yeah he could finish up Prey
[4:25:12] <%Rostichenburg> The big bee is supposed to bounce around the room and break the wall
[4:25:12] <cerberuscarmine> bee chairs for BEES
[4:25:15] <%jiin6> Short cut to false hopes
[4:25:15] <Tisaric> Prey is super good and the DLC was fun
[4:25:15] <MyNameIsRasus> She talks crazy talk
[4:25:20] <%stigna1> Aww, this big ol fuzzy bees are so great.
[4:25:21] <Donchalant402> @TheTakkster he already streamed some of prey
[4:25:23] <%ArcanumMBD> @AngriestPat Play Death's Gambit. It's only 8ish hours
[4:25:27] <Flyrant> play Tekken
[4:25:28] <%TheTakkster> aww
[4:25:30] <$magikestral> the shortest path would be the tram bench, to the hole in the side of the hive, to ths one you just unlocked
[4:25:33] <%Rostichenburg> It is a shortcut to the bench he just went the wrong way
[4:25:37] <Tomschiii> 10 hrs *
[4:25:45] <Flyrant> you did it already by accident
[4:25:46] <$SGrim> What do bees do before dinner? WASP their hands tpRWBYyang
[4:25:47] <ekkieekk> you did it without trying
[4:25:48] <Donchalant402> @AngriestPat DASH JUMP AT THE TOP
[4:25:51] <$magikestral> you did it by accit
[4:25:51] <MainMan_Jonadiah> Well, too late now, you already did it, haha
[4:25:51] <+BurncoatRapscallion> You don't have to anymore, you got lucky with a bee earlier
[4:25:52] <$shadow1man9> @AngriestPat The bee already broke the wall to the shortcut
[4:25:53] <%stigna1> @AngriestPat The mask shard was hidden behind a breakable wall that only the big bees can smash. It already did it for ya.
[4:25:54] <thisisacoolguy> bee liek hunny
[4:25:55] <+Jaysky> Don't need to anymore Pat, kill them all
[4:25:57] <dekkitout> maybe to leave a witness
[4:25:58] <%ArcanumMBD> @AngriestPat you dont need a big bee. You got the heart piece by pure fucking luck
[4:26:00] <Flyrant> no you got it, it was the mask shard @AngriestPat
[4:26:00] <MyNameIsRasus> No need for that anymore
[4:26:01] <+Corvax__> Dont worry about the big bee thing anymore
[4:26:02] <cerberuscarmine> bee boi
[4:26:02] <Innocuous_Goat> It was for the shard you got
[4:26:03] <%Kuro_Koshka> You already got the MASK SHARD from Big Bee
[4:26:04] <Mesonoxian_Methuselah> it was for the mask shard, but you got one to break the wall off screen without trying somehow
[4:26:05] <%Rostichenburg> There's a grubmo in here
[4:26:05] <$Mendin> You lucky Tedded the big bee requirement already you shitgoblin
[4:26:06] <AtlasMcCoy> Pat, the big bee can smash some things. You accidentally got the big bee to smash the glass that contained the mask shard.
[4:26:08] <zal_silverfang> already did it
[4:26:09] <demolij> The big bee bashes his face into a breakable wall
[4:26:10] <CptBritches> It was the shard
[4:26:13] <+Jaysky> By all logic bees should be be fly
[4:26:14] <CptBritches> You got super lucky
[4:26:14] <$magikestral> the mask shard was behind breakable big bee stuff

[4:30:09] <arcaderabbit48> Thats honestly a fair point, Ive never thought of it that way. He's right though
[4:30:09] <JusTTheGuyYouNeed> play dragons dogma with paige
[4:30:10] <%jiin6> porn game on newgrounds?
[4:30:11] <Tisaric> hiveblood heals your most recent damage, but can only heal one

[4:30:28] <SirSmudgey> You literally did a podcast about the porngame it you amnesiac
[4:30:31] <nepwar> you talked about it on the pod
[4:30:33] <CptBritches> Grub needs your help

[4:30:49] <@Moobot> I've been playing this game for how long? Oh only 4h 30m 51s.
[4:30:49] <Donchalant402> top
[4:30:50] <MainMan_Jonadiah> Grub needs help badly
[4:30:52] <%Rostichenburg> Dig up
[4:30:53] <nexoosen> its real hidden
[4:30:56] <SeventyForce> Pat also has dem loopz
[4:30:56] <Donchalant402> this room
[4:30:57] <nepwar> i never found it tho.. uhh for funsies obv
[4:31:05] <Flyrant> you only do one a week
[4:31:05] <%ArcanumMBD> previous room
[4:31:05] <Donchalant402> not the boss room
[4:31:06] <nexoosen> The room Before! the boss
[4:31:07] <$shadow1man9> Back up
[4:31:13] <%ArcanumMBD> BEFORE the boss
[4:31:13] <Kghaleon> Not the room with the boss, the prior screen.
[4:31:15] <Donchalant402> room before the boss
[4:31:17] <Tisaric> before the boss
[4:31:24] <MyNameIsRasus> God the backseat
[4:31:26] <crimsonharvest> theck that floor? there was a little space
[4:31:27] <Donchalant402> go to the top of the toom
[4:31:33] <nepwar> yea having shit memories suck. i can't remember my first 10 years
[4:31:34] <Flyrant> twitch plays hollow knight
[4:31:38] <%PatNTheHat> So, does that passive healing pin synergize with the extra healing pin at all?
[4:31:40] <Kghaleon> Took me 20 minutes to find it even knowing it was there.
[4:31:41] <%stigna1> Oh, here's the beastiary for the Hive Knight: "Loyal protector of The Hive's Queen. Flightless but ferocious in battle. Some creatures are born with duties and loyalties marked indelibly upon their minds. They are strong, but they are also slaves."
[4:31:54] <SevenVileEyes> @kghaleon same
[4:31:54] <Donchalant402> here
[4:31:58] <CptBritches> Don't bully the bees
[4:31:58] <Donchalant402> dash
[4:32:02] <$Tredecian> crystal dash
[4:32:03] <knomad2b> twitch complains about hollow knight
[4:32:13] <nexoosen> oh god with this high an amount of damage it might bee awkward
[4:32:16] <%stigna1> @PatNTheHat Not as such; Hiveblood replaces each of your "hearts" with "hive-hearts" that slowly fill on their own, once lost. It does not work with your healing spells.
[4:32:17] <nexoosen> OH WAIT
[4:32:21] <nexoosen> figured it out
[4:32:26] <%Rostichenburg> Nope the passive healing pin lets you heal from a hit but will not heal past that if you get hit before it's done
[4:32:27] <Donchalant402> this is SUPER hard to find
[4:32:32] <nexoosen> I got that by bouncing off bees
[4:32:33] <SevenVileEyes> this was the last grub i found in the game, had to watch a youtube video to find this asshole
[4:32:38] <%ArcanumMBD> This was the last grub I got in my 100% playthrough because IT IS BULLSHIT
[4:32:39] <AtlasMcCoy> It's not hard to find if you have TIMESTOP
[4:32:43] <Worldbrand> oh wow
[4:32:46] <%stigna1> @AngriestPat Later on you get a TIMESTOP. But yeah.
[4:32:48] <%Rostichenburg> I just got the timestop
[4:32:52] <%Kirijuo> Timestop
[4:32:54] <+Ciphris> i was a mad girl and used enemies to pogo up to that part >_>;
[4:32:55] <%PatNTheHat> @stigna1 Gotcha
[4:32:57] <ShawnEXE> The hardest grub
[4:32:59] <CptBritches> This little grub is a pro
[4:32:59] <MyNameIsRasus> Would be awesome if the game mad it easier for you to find the grubs late game. Oh wait Kappa
[4:33:07] <thisisacoolguy> You have to do something like that in the new DLC to fight the hardest boss in the game
[4:33:09] <nepwar> secreto room
[4:33:13] <+Gorgen> I just want a random grub to think 'Please dont break my jar'
[4:33:27] <SaltBuster> Those would be the mimics
[4:33:28] <nexoosen> "I like it in here"
[4:33:30] <$Tredecian> "beat his ass"
[4:33:30] <$magikestral> grimm first, you need to see what you're up against
[4:33:32] <Donchalant402> you have one more grimkin to kill I think
[4:33:33] <Luftraumm> @angriestpat did u find the collector?
[4:33:36] <%TheTakkster> "beat his ass"
[4:33:37] <AtlasMcCoy> "Beat his ass"
[4:33:37] <%Rostichenburg> How long will we be here watching the Grimm fight
[4:33:38] <captainofcosmos> monkaS
[4:33:39] <CptBritches> With your strong son who you feed
[4:33:42] <+Jaysky> HAH
[4:33:42] <%Kirijuo> "Beat his ass" Pat says some funny things sometimes
[4:33:44] <ShawnEXE> Did you find all the fires?
[4:33:44] <+JustToWatch> yeah havefun with that
[4:33:46] <nexoosen> Hmmmmmmmm
[4:33:51] <%Higgsworth> Crazy how these grubs beat all these bosses only to get caught in a shitty little glass jay.
[4:33:52] <ekkieekk> yeah he has all the fires
[4:33:53] <thisisacoolguy> Just teleport to dirtmouth?
[4:33:54] <%Higgsworth> *jar
[4:33:55] <%Rostichenburg> I think I read that the Nightmare King scales with Nail level
[4:33:56] <+Jaysky> Yes very strong
[4:34:01] <CptBritches> The backdown
[4:34:05] <MyNameIsRasus> Pat there's a reason they put in a "bitch out" option
[4:34:13] <+BurncoatRapscallion> The big Back Down
[4:34:14] <Mesonoxian_Methuselah> I suggest trying for the last health upgrades before attempting Grimm
[4:34:19] <Donchalant402> @AngriestPat Final form grimm is the hardest boss in the game pre-godmaster. He is the clear superboss.
[4:34:23] <%Rostichenburg> Beside the source of acid blight
[4:34:24] <%stigna1> @Rostichenburg Yeah, its one of the few bosses that scales with you a bit, so its always a bit of a challange. The upgrades still help though.
[4:34:29] <$magikestral> i want to say you can totally head back through the waterways here
[4:34:33] <+Jaysky> Nah, Grimm is ez pz
[4:34:34] <thisisacoolguy> I suggest just fighting grimm and not worrying about the chat
[4:34:34] <Tisaric> The map is so fucking well thought out
[4:34:34] <nexoosen> Pat quick question, which amp did you settle with on warframe? been toying around with em and just curious
[4:34:35] <%TheImmortal70> Well I'm out
[4:34:40] <Namboto> the backseating is one reason (of many) that an LP would've been a bad idea
[4:34:41] <%TheImmortal70> Enjoy your four more hours of bug stream
[4:34:42] <CptBritches> The level design is top notch
[4:34:49] <%TheImmortal70> I think he might actually get the first ending tonight at this map
[4:34:50] <%stigna1> @nexoosen He's on 1/1/1.
[4:34:51] <+Dimfish> the interlinking of the zones really helps the world feel whole, its why i love this shit so much
[4:34:53] <%TheImmortal70> *rate
[4:34:54] <ShawnEXE> welllllll
[4:34:55] <$Tredecian> ! no thats something else with ismas growth on it!
[4:34:56] <cerberuscarmine> hes a bad boi
[4:34:56] <AtlasMcCoy> if
[4:34:58] <mtgtin> lul
[4:34:58] <Borealum_EX> wellllllllllllll
[4:34:58] <+Dimfish> welllllll
[4:35:02] <$magikestral> i want pat to face him immediately
[4:35:02] <ekkieekk> welllll
[4:35:02] <cerberuscarmine> eeeeeh
[4:35:03] <SaltBuster> Pat can do it
[4:35:03] <CptBritches> You can do it, you are big and strong
[4:35:03] <nexoosen> @stigna1 ahhh ok
[4:35:05] <+Bt_Robot> AT STILL HASN'T EXPLORED THE LEFT SIDE OF THE ANCIENT BASIN TRAM STATION
[4:35:05] <$Mendin> I think he's using a 111 but any X23 is usually the go-to, though that was before the 4s and the revamps
[4:35:05] <leole11> weeeeeeeeeellllll
[4:35:06] <cerberuscarmine> NO SPOILS
[4:35:06] <+ahdurian> weeelllllllllllllll
[4:35:06] <+Dimfish> depends on your play style
[4:35:07] <SaltBuster> Pat's big and strong
[4:35:09] <cerberuscarmine> :3
[4:35:10] <Borealum_EX> weeeeeeeeeeeeeelll
[4:35:13] <%Kirijuo> welllllllllllllll
[4:35:16] <Donchalant402> PRE-Godmaster. GODMASTER HAS SOME PROPER BULLSHIT.
[4:35:16] <+Dimfish> some people think the true final boss is harder than grimm
[4:35:19] <%TheImmortal70> @angriestpat Yeah no that guy kinda maybe sorta lied but not really. he's the hardest boss for.... ehh?
[4:35:21] <nepwar> defeat him to become the hughest
[4:35:23] <Kghaleon> So he doesn't lose the upgrade lady by killing Grim?
[4:35:23] <captainofcosmos> chat no spoil
[4:35:23] <ekkieekk> lets just say godmasters a buncha bullshit
[4:35:24] <+Ultimatefool> Back to the poo zone
[4:35:24] <demolij> Some people are wrong
[4:35:26] <+Gorgen> best wf amp?
[4:35:32] <arcaderabbit48> People are just chomping at the bit to spoil shit, its great
[4:35:33] <MonocledGhost> ye, depends on how you go about it
[4:35:39] <Donchalant402> @Dimfish those people are wrong
[4:35:39] <%TheImmortal70> @AngriestPat Look just stop worrying about it. He maybe kinda sorta is. You'll see eventually
[4:35:49] <%Higgsworth> @Gorgen Alt + F4
[4:35:55] <%stigna1> @Dimfish I did, myself. Grimm ain't that crazy if you can learn his dance. The trick is to never have to stop to heal. But everyone lives their own truth, y'know?
[4:35:56] <+Gorgen> Rude.
[4:35:58] <AtlasMcCoy> Time to get lost in the sewers boys
[4:35:58] <$magikestral> @kghaleon she's the one thing that stays
[4:36:06] <+yet_another_brony> no spolers, but the final final boss fight is not to be taken lightly
[4:36:10] <Zanicedg> @AngriestPat Godmaster is nearby.
[4:36:13] <%Higgsworth> skidVV
[4:36:19] <%stigna1> Oh no! SOmeone said Godmaster DLC lives in the sewers.
[4:36:21] <+Jaysky> LIGHTly
[4:36:22] <+Bt_Robot> LOOK AT YOUR MAP
[4:36:25] <$Tredecian> shortvut
[4:36:35] <%TheImmortal70> Shortbut
[4:36:35] <CptBritches> MAP DESIGN
[4:36:38] <$magikestral> this is a fantastic shortcut to the weird lady
[4:36:39] <+Gorgen> is THIS Anor Londo?
[4:36:43] <+Bt_Robot> YOU MISSED AN ENTRANCE TO KINGDOM'S EDGE
[4:36:46] <mothdude> Godmaster is in room right before flukemom.
[4:36:46] <+Dimfish> @Donchalant402 they are very different fights on the grander scheem, i can understand why some people would find one harder than the other
[4:36:47] <ekkieekk> i would wait for godmaster until youve completed grimm and the base game
[4:36:47] <Kghaleon> Maybe people should point out where Godmaster starts.
[4:36:50] <%Rostichenburg> It's close to Anor Londo
[4:36:51] <Donchalant402> cause darksouls shortcuts
[4:36:52] <CptBritches> Just because it's good map design
[4:36:58] <thisisacoolguy> Good maps
[4:36:59] <%TheImmortal70> @angriestpat If you think about it, the areas are connected SO well
[4:37:04] <+Dimfish> great maps
[4:37:10] <dekkitout> did someone say shortcut porm?
[4:37:21] <%Higgsworth> @AngriestPat I honestly don't know how you cope with all these nerds yelling at you,
[4:37:21] <Donchalant402> thats fine
[4:37:22] <+Dimfish> thats fine
[4:37:23] <SatansDick1> me niether
[4:37:26] <$RaikenTB> same.
[4:37:26] <%TheImmortal70> I don't blame you
[4:37:27] <cerberuscarmine> same
[4:37:31] <powerprotoman> yep thats blasphemy
[4:37:33] <+Rose_Inko> I like the music.
[4:37:34] <demolij> Sure, I haven't played it or nothin'
[4:37:34] <+yet_another_brony> i liked it
[4:37:37] <$Tredecian> floor
[4:37:40] <%TheImmortal70> The endings are weird and hard as fuck to get if you know nothing
[4:37:41] <ShawnEXE> floor
[4:37:43] <Zanicedg> Hidden floor
[4:37:43] <+Dimfish> for an early indie game its hella good
[4:37:43] <Donchalant402> @AngriestPat floor of the previous room
[4:37:44] <%Rostichenburg> Floor
[4:37:44] <$Tredecian> behind you slam
[4:37:45] <CptBritches> Yeah, it's really impressive, but I don't really care much either
[4:37:46] <+Gorgen> floor
[4:37:46] <%TheImmortal70> The best ending is a pain in the goddamn ASS
[4:37:50] <$shadow1man9> @AngriestPat Dive spot right before that wall you broke
[4:37:52] <%Sirculbs> floor in previous room
[4:37:56] <Zanicedg> @AngriestPat Breakable floor.
[4:37:56] <%TheImmortal70> FUCK THE BEST ENDING
[4:38:00] <SatansDick1> shaky floor
[4:38:01] <%TheImmortal70> YOU NEED TO SAVE A JAR FOR THAT
[4:38:01] <Donchalant402> WALKED RIGHT PAST IT
[4:38:02] <sileo_patronus> honk
[4:38:03] <+Gorgen> WALKED OVER IT TWICE
[4:38:05] <Mesonoxian_Methuselah> missed the floor
[4:38:06] <+Bt_Robot> HONK
[4:38:07] <%stigna1> @TheImmortal70 Yeah, the PoP is the true final boss. :p
[4:38:08] <$Tredecian> near the door
[4:38:16] <%TheImmortal70> @stigna1 I'm talking cave story
[4:38:17] <+Bt_Robot> BEEP

[4:38:43] <cerberuscarmine> plague no D:
[4:38:47] <%TheImmortal70> @PlagueOfGripes Eh that's fine, it's better to experience it vicariously through Pat's dumb shit

[4:45:14] <ekkieekk> zote gives grimm nightmares
[4:45:15] <%TheImmortal70> The hardest part of this damn fight is his random teleports
[4:45:15] <%Rostichenburg> Grey Prince Zote is his name
[4:45:15] <%stigna1> Those adds are called "Winged Zotelings": Figment of an obsessed mind. Grudgingly assists its master in combat by lazily Flying towards foes. "She asked whether he had bought the Charm for her as he promised he would, but then he explained. The Charm was actually of low quality and not worth the price asked. She understood the wisdom of his decision perfectly." - 'The Grey Prince' Chapter 136

[4:45:28] <ValidVenasaur> the chad zote and the virgin vessel
[4:45:37] <$magikestral> zoteling spits are a great time to heal
[4:45:37] <DracaenaLeaf> IS he getting smaller?
[4:45:38] <dekkitout> Legendary Super Saiyan Zote
[4:45:38] <%MagickBurritoh> are you literally cutting him down to size?
[4:45:38] <SevenVileEyes> that quick slash tho
[4:45:41] <%stigna1> @vdalson Nope, first time here.
[4:45:42] <Donchalant402> @AngriestPat Every time you beat Grey Prince Zote he gets gets another adjective added to your next run and gets harder, for a maximum of 10 runs
[4:45:47] <+BurncoatRapscallion> I'd like the Zote fight a lot better if he had maybe 1 or 2 less things going on
[4:45:47] <Worldbrand> oh nice
[4:45:48] <ShawnEXE> It's not over
[4:45:48] <DesuDesuDokiDoki> YEYEYEYE

[4:45:53] <+Dimfish> got him ONCE
[4:45:53] <AtlasMcCoy> @AngriestPat Now just do that 9 more times but he gets harder each time
[4:45:53] <cerberuscarmine> ZOTE NO

[4:45:57] <ValidVenasaur> not yet
[4:45:57] <demolij> Do it again!
[4:45:58] <%PatNTheHat> That seemed like more than one strike, Zote
[4:45:58] <Theoyveyman> You can fight him again
[4:45:58] <thisisacoolguy> Pat how dos it feel knowing a single artist did everything in this game
[4:46:00] <%stigna1> lol
[4:46:00] <Zanicedg> 3 more.
[4:46:01] <$Tredecian> *9 more times
[4:46:01] <+PrinceofTheUniverse> 9 more times
[4:46:02] <$magikestral> @angriestpat he's one of the few bosses you can fight again
[4:46:04] <nexoosen> FUCK HIM UP PAT
[4:46:05] <%Sirculbs> Now do it 9 more times
[4:46:05] <+Dimfish> do it 9 more times for good shit
[4:46:06] <+Camail> you dont ahve to do all 10
[4:46:06] <$SGrim> NTR is a trash fetish for trash people. rooKek
[4:46:07] <leole11> no
[4:46:08] <+ShinyMonger> Well, 9 more
[4:46:08] <@PlagueOfGripes> why
[4:46:08] <+Corvax__> no ten is what it was before
[4:46:09] <iwa5h4ck3d> you dont have to
[4:46:10] <custoadian> You get the essence the first time
[4:46:10] <MyNameIsRasus> Great now do it thrice more
[4:46:11] <mothdude> Godmaster Zote has an entire screen full of adjectives.
[4:46:11] <Donchalant402> @AngriestPat Every time you beat Grey Prince Zote he gets gets another adjective added to your next run and gets harder for a maximum of 10 runs
[4:46:11] <+Bt_Robot> FOR THE HONOR
[4:46:11] <+WhyIDie> 3 more to complete the beastiary I believe
[4:46:12] <%TheImmortal70> @angriestpat Yeah you gotta do it 9 times to get it done
[4:46:12] <leole11> just try a second time
[4:46:15] <zal_silverfang> Yes ten
[4:46:16] <+BurncoatRapscallion> You don't need to do it any more times than that unless you want to kill Bretta
[4:46:20] <$magikestral> @angriestpat 3 more for story, 9 times for a golden statue
[4:46:22] <+PrinceofTheUniverse> you do 4 more times for the lor ebut 9 more times for the achievement
[4:46:22] <$Mendin> Hey Pat, go check out Shit Defender for another rowdy punch-up
[4:46:23] <+Bt_Robot> NOT FOR ESSENCE
[4:46:24] <+JustToWatch> @AngriestPat you only have to do it once lol
[4:46:24] <+Camail> fuck this fight at 10
[4:46:25] <%TheImmortal70> Bretta specifically DOESN"T die
[4:46:25] <SaltBuster> Oh is there like, 1 less zote on the bed?
[4:46:26] <%stigna1> @AngriestPat You got all the essence you're gonna have though.
[4:46:27] <$RaikenTB> @SGrim Don't say that about Pat's fetish.
[4:46:27] <DivineDragoonKain> you only fight him once for essence
[4:46:31] <%ArcanumMBD> @AngriestPat Lighting all the candles triggers a thing. But doing it 10 times turns the statue gold but otherwise does nothing
[4:46:31] <$magikestral> he has a new adjective
[4:46:31] <Donchalant402> NAME IS LONGER
[4:46:32] <+Bt_Robot> BUT FOR FUN
[4:46:37] <dekkitout> sex god zote's ready or 54 more rounds of love making
[4:46:38] <Hydrapissed> Gorgeous
[4:46:48] <$SGrim> @RaikenTB are you trying to lie and say Pat isn't trash?
[4:46:49] <MyNameIsRasus> 4 times for quest ending, 10, if you have big ballz
[4:46:50] <%Rostichenburg> Go look at Britta too
[4:46:56] <ekkieekk> thankfully zote is really easy to learn
[4:47:09] <+Jaysky> Shame Zote doesn't learn
[4:47:11] <ShawnEXE> Yeah Zote is one of the easier bosses to learn
[4:47:19] <$magikestral> talk to britta before the next try
[4:47:21] <%TheImmortal70> It's the same moveset?!
[4:47:22] <+PrinceofTheUniverse> at 10 he does 7 dmg in 1 hit
[4:47:26] <%stigna1> Those new adds are called "Hopping Zotelings": Figment of an obsessed mind. Jumps about in a nonthreatening manner. "That lowly map-maker's wife? Hah! My Queen, how could you compare yourself to her? In the face of your intoxicating beauty, all other females are merely dust!" The Grey Prince trembled with anger and indignation... and love. - 'The Grey Prince' Chapter 178
[4:47:29] <+Dimfish> quickslash baybeeee
[4:47:31] <+Camail> wait till he does 2 health
[4:47:32] <Kghaleon> His ads are different too
[4:47:34] <thisisacoolguy> The new Godmaster Zote Fight is literally impossible
[4:47:44] <%ArcanumMBD> @AngriestPat the most important thing about doing the fight 10 times is seeing all the titles Zote gets
[4:47:45] <Donchalant402> @TheImmortal70 he gets more stuff
[4:47:45] <$RaikenTB> @SGrim LUL
[4:47:48] <Hydrapissed> 2 more
[4:47:52] <Zanicedg> Good job.
[4:47:53] <%TheImmortal70> Is the godmaster fights literally just max damage fights?
[4:47:55] <$magikestral> talk to bretta @angriestpat
[4:47:56] <cerberuscarmine> D:
[4:47:58] <Zanicedg> 2 more.
[4:47:58] <Eresus> go check on bretta
[4:47:59] <%stigna1> @AngriestPat You can do more if you like, but you have all the essence already.
[4:48:00] <+Camail> i was excited fort godmaster until i learned it was just a boss rush
[4:48:01] <%Divryne> Go back up
[4:48:04] <thisisacoolguy> No, zote gets something unique

[4:48:09] <$Tredecian> nail her
[4:48:10] <Eresus> nail
[4:48:11] <ShawnEXE> nail her
[4:48:11] <Mesonoxian_Methuselah> you only get the essence from the first time, the next two/three fights are for hunter's journal entries and story, and the ones after that up to ten are just for challenge or bragging rights
[4:48:12] <+Dimfish> nail her
[4:48:12] <Donchalant402> @thisisacoolguy did you see the hidden zote fight?

[4:49:06] <Zanicedg> THE VESSEL IS A PHANTOM THIEF!!
[4:49:08] <Donchalant402> @AngriestPat Every time you beat him she dislikes him more
[4:49:10] <%TheImmortal70> this is the best ending for her
[4:49:12] <knomad2b> a ton lately
[4:49:13] <$Mendin> Hey Pat go try Dung Defender after this
[4:49:15] <%Kirijuo> Tags: Mind-Break, NTR
[4:49:18] <SaltBuster> PHANTOM THEIF
[4:49:20] <$magikestral> @mendin can't
[4:49:22] <%TheImmortal70> She literally becomes a warrior princess and moves on to find love on her own
[4:49:23] <+Gorgen> I feel bad for them both
[4:49:26] <CptBritches> MORE ADJECTIVES
[4:49:26] <cerberuscarmine> LOL
[4:49:27] <+Jaysky> You steal mens SOULS and make them your SLAVES

[4:49:33] <SirSmudgey> Zote's title is getting even longer lol

[4:49:41] <knomad2b> i love this
[4:49:42] <$Mendin> I thought he and Zote were accessible at the same time, we still need the timestop?
[4:49:46] <+Dimfish> quick slash my man
[4:49:49] <%TheImmortal70> QUICK MOTHERFUCKIN SLASH
[4:49:53] <Donchalant402> ZOTE BOMBS
[4:49:53] <Estuko> Wait, are they adding more words to him, he's getting stronger with more titles? that's amazing
[4:49:54] <+Gorgen> NEW SHIT
[4:49:54] <+leomc2> *sigh* bapanada
[4:50:00] <thisisacoolguy> ZOOTAAAAH
[4:50:01] <+WhyIDie> quick slash + reach is the boss killer
[4:50:06] <%stigna1> Those new adds are called Volatile Zotelings: "Figment of an obsessed mind. Deals poorly with the pressure of existing and quickly explodes. "The Grey Prince was a wanderer by nature, but she could not bear to be seperated from him. So she devised a plan to make sure that she and her prince would be together always. She only had to wait for her chance." - 'The Grey Prince' Chapter 205"
[4:50:13] <zal_silverfang> it's strange how dream Zote gets more powerful here while Bretta in the real world slowly loses faith in Zote
[4:50:16] <DesuDesuDokiDoki> wew
[4:50:17] <Flyrant> on certain bosses, some you don't get much chance to hit them
[4:50:24] <narusao> bapanda indeed good sir.. bapanda indeed
[4:50:25] <Zanicedg> Look at journal for zotlings
[4:50:26] <%TheImmortal70> Now you actually have to fight him though
[4:50:27] <Estuko> 7 more times?
[4:50:30] <$magikestral> @zal_silverfang it means she's trying harder
[4:50:31] <nexoosen> " Deals poorly with the pressure of existing" 2meirl4meirl
[4:50:34] <$magikestral> one more time for story
[4:50:39] <Zanicedg> @AngriestPat Check journal for funny entry.
[4:50:47] <%TheImmortal70> He is so huge he bleeds into her hitbox

[4:51:02] <Zanicedg> Volotile one.

[4:51:57] <ShawnEXE> Denial
[4:51:59] <$magikestral> she's trying harder
[4:52:02] <Hydrapissed> Denial and faith
[4:52:02] <cerberuscarmine> shes in denial
[4:52:03] <+Dimfish> because youre breaking deeper into her subconcious
[4:52:04] <%Divryne> She's hanging onto her fantasy.
[4:52:04] <cerberuscarmine> i mean
[4:52:05] <%stigna1> Fervent denial, I suppose.
[4:52:05] <Hunk_Of_Dunk> She's trying to justify it
[4:52:05] <Donchalant402> her psyche fighting back against truth?
[4:52:07] <Innocuous_Goat> Desperatly clinging to the fantasy I guess
[4:52:07] <ekkieekk> I think shes actively trying to build him up in her mind
[4:52:07] <+korth367> bideo games
[4:52:07] <dekkitout> BECAUSE VIDEOGAME NOW SHUDDAP
[4:52:09] <MyNameIsRasus> Denial

[4:52:12] <$SGrim> Desperation? rooShrug
[4:52:13] <arcaderabbit48> She's desperately trying to convince herself that Zote is still amazing
[4:52:16] <SchroedingersFerret> Zote is basically Groose
[4:52:18] <+BurncoatRapscallion> careful, 2 pips
[4:52:20] <nexoosen> the other inserts seem to be from her doubts, like bafanada

[4:53:08] <ValidVenasaur> pretty he can ohko after a couple of fights
[4:53:08] <Mesonoxian_Methuselah> thorns
[4:53:08] <Hydrapissed> its a dream so fragile hp maybe
[4:53:16] <Zanicedg> heart will give more hp.
[4:53:17] <arcaderabbit48> @arcanalicht He said he will this weekend
[4:53:18] <%TheImmortal70> Fragile health is something
[4:53:26] <ekkieekk> fragile items dont break in dream fights btw
[4:53:28] <%TheImmortal70> ...What
[4:53:28] <Envy_the_spider> honey one ?
[4:53:30] <$magikestral> thorns are also good
[4:53:31] <+Dimfish> he only has one slot to work with tho
[4:53:36] <+Bt_Robot> DOES DASHMASTER WORK ON SHADOW DASH?
[4:53:38] <%Rostichenburg> Honey no good for this fight
[4:53:39] <%TheImmortal70> It does
[4:53:40] <Zanicedg> Steady body!?
[4:53:45] <Eresus> @Bt_Robot nop
[4:53:49] <Donchalant402> @Bt_Robot it synergies with it
[4:53:49] <AtlasMcCoy> dashmaster doesnt effect shadow
[4:53:50] <SeventyForce> Kill her hopes and dreamsssss
[4:53:50] <%stigna1> @Bt_Robot No; shade cloak works on its own cooldown.
[4:53:54] <Flyrant> I find that the ground pound spell helps a lot in this fight, it has iframes and you have to jump over his shockwaves a lot
[4:53:57] <arcanalicht> thanks
[4:54:02] <EMP_Ike_Turner> grown damage

[5:06:19] <%TheImmortal70> It only heals the last pip of damage you've taken
[5:06:19] <$rdark_ksu> You are a weird golem thing made to protect them......Fuck you are literally a Golem
[5:06:23] <%TheImmortal70> So it's purely for THAT zone
[5:06:30] <$magikestral> honey is not worth it, strength works with yout winions
[5:06:31] <AncelDeLambert> the lore is all at the END of the game and it shotguns it at you
[5:06:34] <+Dimfish> you werent meant to fix it but youre good enough to take the place of the guy who was
[5:06:37] <damienlunas> Sprintmaster buffs the aggro range on spiders
[5:06:41] <AtlasMcCoy> +iframes?
[5:06:42] <CptBritches> Look at that good boy Grimmchild. He can do it
[5:06:43] <asbestosflavored> shield is a minion
[5:06:45] <+MonXara_Z> your the hero they need not what they deserve
[5:06:49] <+Dimfish> thats what hornet basically told you
[5:06:50] <+Gorgen> Pat go to bed
[5:06:50] <Donchalant402> you're a shitty dark souls hollow, and the hollow knight is the chosen undead
[5:06:51] <nooblord_derpington> Pat talking to a skeleton
[5:06:53] <Hydrapissed> Think they both do
[5:06:53] <MyNameIsRasus> One thing I don't get from the lore: if you're from the Abyss, why do you start the game outside Hallownest?
[5:06:59] <cerberuscarmine> zote is too much for pat
[5:07:02] <CptBritches> Rolling out with the whole crew
[5:07:03] <cerberuscarmine> a true hero
[5:07:10] <Hunk_Of_Dunk> @MyNameIsRasus That's the one aspect of the lore that nobody knows
[5:07:11] <+Gorgen> wait i thought he was talking with Elmo
[5:07:14] <%Falilth> no shes not
[5:07:16] <%Dani_el_Dani> apatSkelmo apatSkelmo apatSkelmoney apatSkelmoney
[5:07:19] <SkullKingKota> Skelmo lives
[5:07:23] <dekkitout> *Skelmo will remember that
[5:07:30] <Donchalant402> @MyNameIsRasus you left hollownest
[5:07:30] <%Rostichenburg> Hungry Knight may or may not be canon
[5:07:34] <+Jaysky> Because you escaped MyNameIsRasus and went elsewhere
[5:07:34] <+SuperiorDelta> Man now I am sad just beat the main story for Monster Hunter BibleThump
[5:07:42] <Donchalant402> you crawled out and left
[5:07:49] <+Dimfish> @MyNameIsRasus you seem to have crawled out from under hollownest, which appears to be some kind of giant mound, and ended up in the wastes outside the howling cliffs?
[5:07:55] <@PlagueOfGripes> this looks like something that would make me incredibly angry
[5:08:02] <burna_lova> You could go find the last couple of charms and get some more options.

[5:08:19] <@Moobot> I've been playing this game for how long? Oh only 5h 8m 21s.
[5:08:19] <Donchalant402> Fog Canyon would be next on the list
[5:08:20] <+Jaysky> Know what wouldn't make you angry Plague? Hornet.
[5:08:21] <dekkitout> let it slow cook in your noggin
[5:08:21] <ValidVenasaur> big back doen
[5:08:21] <$RaikenTB> when's next scumbag stream?
[5:08:22] <$Mendin> In all the 1-damage fights you were still rubbing your face all over him and j ust won the damage race
[5:08:23] <%Rostichenburg> Unclear how the Knight escaped if the King sealed the Abyss
[5:08:24] <+CrystalLakeWasJusASetback> You need to go full nail mode for him.
[5:08:25] <SirSmudgey> If you aren't going to heal you should equip the blueheart charm
[5:08:26] <CptBritches> Don't you enjoy being angry, though Plague?
[5:08:26] <$shadow1man9> Fog Canyon time?
[5:08:29] <thetechnicalraven> What Pat fuckery did I miss?
[5:08:30] <+Bt_Robot> DEEPNEST
[5:08:31] <SeventyForce> But Pat is killing someone's hopes and dreams doe
[5:08:32] <$magikestral> you can now access more areas, like fog canyon
[5:08:33] <AncelDeLambert> put it on bricks?
[5:08:34] <Mesonoxian_Methuselah> quick
[5:08:36] <%Kuro_Koshka> Dream shield is underrated
[5:08:40] <%TheImmortal70> Dream shield does nail damage
[5:08:42] <$SGrim> Always quickslash
[5:08:44] <bambowl> is zote a 4 square boi? @angriestpat
[5:08:44] <%TheImmortal70> It's actually really good
[5:08:45] <@PlagueOfGripes> equip the BEES charm
[5:08:45] <SevenVileEyes> well there's one map you didn't even find yet
[5:08:47] <%Rostichenburg> Quick attack
[5:08:47] <$Mendin> The baby
[5:08:48] <CptBritches> Dream shield is pretty damn good
[5:08:51] <Mesonoxian_Methuselah> quick slash
[5:08:55] <%TheImmortal70> Quick slash
[5:08:58] <%TheImmortal70> Or shield is good
[5:09:00] <knomad2b> a lil
[5:09:02] <Hydrapissed> ITS A NIPPLE
[5:09:02] <nexoosen> pat does not like the dream shield at all
[5:09:05] <+Dimfish> fog canyon for new shit, deepnest for new charm
[5:09:05] <Eresus> the optional bosses of the game are not fun unless you really like hard bosses
[5:09:06] <+BurncoatRapscallion> It's a hentai nipple
[5:09:06] <dekkitout> looks more like a cockring
[5:09:07] <Zanicedg> @AngriestPat You wanna get that charm in deepnaest
[5:09:08] <Tisaric> IT'S CLOSE AT LEAST
[5:09:08] <%Divryne> IT'S AN ANAL.
[5:09:08] <+Rose_Inko> NIPPLE HOLE
[5:09:09] <sileo_patronus> It's a butthole
[5:09:09] <demolij> It's just got a big araeola
[5:09:10] <Hunk_Of_Dunk> It's one of those weird internet artist buttholes
[5:09:10] <SaltBuster> That nipple is actually super strong
[5:09:11] <Donchalant402> @AngriestPat you never did check out the unn blessing, check out it just see see what it looks like. Its silly
[5:09:13] <%theblackgoddess> girl thats a booty hole
[5:09:17] <damienlunas> @AngriestPat I didn't tackle these guys until I got 100% of the charms.
[5:09:20] <SaltBuster> It's a really really strong nipple
[5:09:22] <$SGrim> It looks like a prolapse. rooShrug
[5:09:22] <%TheImmortal70> How are you suppose to use flukes
[5:09:24] <SatansDick1> ffog canyon
[5:09:24] <+Gorgen> beep nest
[5:09:25] <CptBritches> It's one of those hentai nipples that are so big that you can stick a dick in them
[5:09:26] <%TheImmortal70> They just lay on the ground
[5:09:26] <$shadow1man9> @AngriestPat Fog Canyon time?
[5:09:26] <SeventyForce> NIPPLES HAVE HOLES
[5:09:27] <EMP_Ike_Turner> aw dang I missed a round body part
[5:09:28] <$magikestral> deepnest has that one charm, I'd take the hidden station to the tram
[5:09:28] <+harzaz> Strong
[5:09:30] <SaltBuster> It's basically a shotgun
[5:09:30] <custoadian> tram from ancient basin is quickest
[5:09:31] <nexoosen> fluke isnt as strong as iut used to be
[5:09:36] <Zanicedg> Take the tram.
[5:09:41] <%TheImmortal70> Nakta chakta zunda
[5:09:43] <+Bt_Robot> YAY! ARACHNAPHOBIA FOR ALL!
[5:09:44] <SaltBuster> It turns your gun into a shotgun for big damage
[5:09:44] <+Dimfish> indecisive
[5:09:45] <%TheImmortal70> SHUT THE FUCK UP ZOTE
[5:09:45] <Zanicedg> Take tram.
[5:09:47] <nooblord_derpington> How do worms reproduce?
[5:09:49] <SchroedingersFerret> It's like a hentai where they fuck the nipples
[5:09:54] <%Rostichenburg> You can finally get the map for fog canyon now
[5:09:56] <Donchalant402> yeah taking the tram is good advice
[5:10:00] <SatansDick1> distant village
[5:10:03] <CptBritches> BABYYY
[5:10:06] <cerberuscarmine> ZOTE IS THE BEST

[5:10:11] <thetechnicalraven> ELMO PogChamp
[5:10:11] <Donchalant402> @SatansDick1 tram is WAY faster
[5:10:23] <Estuko> "I'LL GET YOU FOR THIS. YOU'LL PAYYYYY"
[5:10:25] <$magikestral> its the one part of deepnest you haven't hit. You can also talk to midwife, but thats a long way to a tiny bit of lore
[5:10:30] <+Jaysky> What is a BEE? A miserable little pile of honey.
[5:10:42] <bambowl> for reasons
[5:10:43] <Estuko> black evil
[5:10:44] <nooblord_derpington> @dimfish sounds about right to me SeemsGood
[5:10:46] <dekkitout> black evil dash
[5:10:52] <thetechnicalraven> Black evil PogChamp
[5:10:56] <Zanicedg> Acid reflection!
[5:10:59] <Donchalant402> thats all the ACTUAL movement upgrades right chat?
[5:11:05] <+Dimfish> male fertilizes eggs while theyre still in the female and then the eggs get left in a kind of cocoon underground
[5:11:06] <+Rose_Inko> @AngriestPat Swimming in acid is a movement ability, pat
[5:11:06] <+Menace109> Pat vs the Evil Black
[5:11:08] <%TheImmortal70> I think?
[5:11:16] <%TheImmortal70> I frame dash, wall jump, double jump
[5:11:22] <SatansDick1> up B
[5:11:26] <%TheImmortal70> Spike slash is one
[5:11:27] <Tisaric> I believe the only new time stop missing is a new spell
[5:11:29] <%TheImmortal70> That you start with
[5:11:30] <nexoosen> He does not have up b
[5:11:32] <%Sirculbs> @angriestpat That Stag has gotta be freaked out by how quickly you're gaining abilities. Like at first you could just dash. Now you're rocketing away from him in a blast of speed.
[5:11:33] <%TheImmortal70> The spike hopping
[5:11:33] <AtlasMcCoy> Beat everyone
[5:11:34] <Donchalant402> dream bosses

[5:11:42] <$magikestral> all the dream bosses, and the trees

[5:12:20] <Zanicedg> For journal.
[5:12:21] <%TheImmortal70> @PlagueOfGripes Let me guess, you fell in here without any movement options or lantern didn't you
[5:12:21] <%Rostichenburg> Garpede lore
[5:12:22] <$magikestral> for the journal
[5:12:22] <Tisaric> You got the bestiary info from it @AngriestPat
[5:12:23] <+Bt_Robot> FOR JOURNAL
[5:12:24] <SirSmudgey> corpse was for journal
[5:12:24] <sileo_patronus> beastiary
[5:12:25] <$shadow1man9> Beastiary entry
[5:12:26] <Ausk> plague go DOWN
[5:12:27] <cerberuscarmine> zote killed it with his huge dick
[5:12:33] <arkv01> black... evil?
[5:12:34] <CptBritches> The black evil
[5:12:35] <Hydrapissed> I mean not really evil
[5:12:36] <Hydrapissed> but k
[5:12:39] <$Mendin> So you can get the journal entry for a garpede
[5:12:45] <%TheImmortal70> I mean if you want to be real the black IS evil technically
[5:12:47] <$Mendin> Since they are immortivincible
[5:12:52] <%TheImmortal70> Black wyrm nonsense
[5:12:54] <nexoosen> The black evil for anyone without context sounds REAL bad
[5:12:58] <%stigna1> Garpede entry: Giant burrower covered in thick shell plates. Tirelessly travels the tunnels of the Deepnest. Monstrously strong, they shrug off any attacks you make on their thickly armoured bodies. Luckily, if you simply avoid their paths they'll leave you alone
[5:12:58] <%Rostichenburg> Something killed it
[5:13:00] <arkv01> uh yeah i just tuned in
[5:13:02] <Hydrapissed> welllll I mean the light is da bad in this
[5:13:02] <+NWR_James> Suck shit, get hit
[5:13:03] <@PlagueOfGripes> this place made me go from "the map system isn't that bad" to "the map system has serious oversights"
[5:13:03] <$Mendin> The black is Void it is not evil please don't be racist
[5:13:08] <arkv01> is the black evil like the abyss or something?
[5:13:11] <+SergeEXE> KIRK
[5:13:13] <Zanicedg> Really good against grimm!
[5:13:16] <%Rostichenburg> Also makes the dash longer
[5:13:16] <+Dimfish> its very useful
[5:13:18] <thetechnicalraven> ㄴ CRAZY TALK ㄱ
[5:13:18] <$magikestral> synergy with dashmaster
[5:13:19] <+SergeEXE> ARMOR OF THORNS
[5:13:20] <+ShinyMonger> It does the same damage as a nail hit
[5:13:24] <+Jaysky> It's from the abyss, yes
[5:13:24] <%TheImmortal70> It is a good one
[5:13:28] <$magikestral> warp back home, its shorter
[5:13:33] <$Mendin> Yeyeye that's good
[5:13:34] <arkv01> ok phew, not back of the bus then
[5:13:34] <dekkitout> fine then, Black Morally Ambiguous
[5:13:35] <$Tredecian> synergises with dashmaster
[5:13:38] <+Dimfish> it also increases dash length slightly, which will FUCK you on pinpoint platforming sections
[5:13:38] <Zanicedg> @AngriestPat Dashmast makes it do more damage.
[5:13:38] <Hydrapissed> stacks with dash and sprinr
[5:13:43] <Donchalant402> @AngriestPat Sharp Shadow deals damage equal to the player's current Nail damage, but is not affected by Fragile Strength or Fury of the Fallen. It is, however, affected by Dashmaster, providing a 50% damage increase. Enemies struck by the Sharp Shadow will not generate SOUL.
[5:13:43] <%Kuro_Koshka> Fight DREAM WARRIOR
[5:13:45] <+Jaysky> It's one of my personal favorites
[5:13:47] <CptBritches> FUCK THIS PLACE
[5:13:49] <SevenVileEyes> sharp shadow is so good
[5:13:49] <+Jaysky> Plus it looks cool
[5:13:50] <SatansDick1> teleport
[5:13:53] <SaltBuster> Was that corpse a dream fight?
[5:14:05] <%TheImmortal70> DASHMASTER BOOSTS IT BY 50%
[5:14:09] <@PlagueOfGripes> bathe in the piss pond
[5:14:12] <%TheImmortal70> I FORGOT
[5:14:17] <%stigna1> @AngriestPat Wasn't there a corpse around here, that could be dream nailed for juicy essence?

[5:14:50] <$magikestral> grub, always
[5:14:54] <Hydrapissed> Can drop mark of pride for long nail and then get dash and sprint master
[5:14:55] <CptBritches> Grubsong is really solid

[5:16:00] <+korth367> this hollow knight addiction is getting out of hand

[5:16:03] <nexoosen> HE WAS JUST GETTING STARTED LETS GO TEAM
[5:16:03] <dekkitout> you have a busted time sense
[5:16:05] <$Mendin> This game got its hooks in you BIG DEEP
[5:16:06] <+yet_another_brony> you are just getting started
[5:16:06] <%Piemen99> 8 HOUR STREAM HERE WE COME
[5:16:06] <%TheImmortal70> @angriestpat Pat, you need to accept that ten hours a day is your life now
[5:16:06] <CptBritches> You STILL haven't even finished the TUTORIAL
[5:16:07] <AncelDeLambert> yep
[5:16:08] <Donchalant402> JUST HOW FAR DOES IT GO WITH DASHMASTER
[5:16:08] <+Bt_Robot> !uptime
[5:16:09] <AtlasMcCoy> Yea so the bad thing about the longer dash is it can REALLY fuck you up on platforming
[5:16:10] <+G_Thunders> Welp, may as well stream for 8 total again
[5:16:12] <+barkon345> this game must be fun then
[5:16:12] <Mesonoxian_Methuselah> just about, give or take 15 minutes
[5:16:13] <asbestosflavored> but you are just getting started
[5:16:13] <Hydrapissed> HEAR THAT beef cake dash noise
[5:16:14] <startadevy> MorphinTime
[5:16:15] <+BurncoatRapscallion> It makes platforming a little less easy sometimes
[5:16:17] <burna_lova> It's even better with Dashmaster.
[5:16:18] <%TheImmortal70> Dash master doesn't increase
[5:16:18] <DapperHatwell> If this is another 8 hour i'm going to bed
[5:16:19] <%TheImmortal70> *length
[5:16:21] <%TheImmortal70> I don't htink
[5:16:21] <startadevy> <3
[5:16:25] <%TheImmortal70> It's just interval
[5:16:25] <$Tredecian> dash master also makes ss longer and let you dash down
[5:16:26] <%stigna1> @AtlasMcCoy Yeah, I ended up going into the PoP with it. >_>
[5:16:28] <%Piemen99> NOOOOOOOO
[5:16:28] <DesuDesuDokiDoki> nooo
[5:16:30] <PumaOfDarkness> Woke up at four in the morning and started watching, now it's eight-fifteen and actually have to leave.
[5:16:32] <JusTTheGuyYouNeed> booooooooo
[5:16:33] <+Dimfish> oh just one more fight?
[5:16:33] <Zanicedg> There is lifeblood above boss.
[5:16:39] <%Piemen99> SLEEP IS FOR THE WEEK
[5:16:40] <+Dimfish> alright i guess i can stay up to watch
[5:16:40] <+FadingEmber> Do you?
[5:16:41] <nexoosen> @TheImmortal70 no but sharp shadow increases the dash range a little
[5:16:41] <+Rose_Inko> sleep is banned
[5:16:41] <%stigna1> apatDab apatDab apatDab
[5:16:43] <DesuDesuDokiDoki> more stream
[5:16:45] <NerevaRising> Remember death from castlevania?
[5:16:47] <%TheImmortal70> Sharp shadow does Yeah
[5:16:49] <Zanicedg> @AngriestPat Explore room first.
[5:16:51] <+SergeEXE> SLEEP WHEN YOU'RE DEAD
[5:16:51] <+Bt_Robot> Sleep is for the weak
[5:16:52] <sileo_patronus> Warframe counts as sleep right?
[5:16:53] <+Jaysky> Sleep is lame but necessary
[5:16:54] <DracusOmega> sleep is for the weak
[5:16:56] <%TheImmortal70> EAT THAT MANS SOUL
[5:16:57] <%Sirculbs> Sleep so you can stream more at a later time.
[5:16:59] <dekkitout> you can sort your space dolls next week
[5:17:00] <$magikestral> pat is delusional
[5:17:03] <%Deft_Thought> Is there a SBFP Warframe group?
[5:17:08] <%whistlehunter> You just passed the ghost
[5:17:15] <+SirNewton2> WE WILL NEVER SLEEP! SLEEP IS FOR THE WEAK!
[5:17:17] <CptBritches> Badass
[5:17:18] <$magikestral> he went to get blue juice
[5:17:18] <Neo_Kaiser> I hope Pat falls asleep live on stream.
[5:17:27] <Hydrapissed> that guy is PAIGE
[5:17:30] <%Rostichenburg> I got stuck at around venus in warframe didn't have enough friends to get further
[5:17:33] <+WhyIDie> like you
[5:17:34] <Tisaric> they don't think they're dead until you fight them
[5:17:36] <Jman409> Holy shit you’re awake?
[5:17:37] <CptBritches> DEATH
[5:17:39] <$magikestral> HE'S DEATH
[5:17:40] <+SergeEXE> COLOSSUS YELL
[5:17:41] <@PlagueOfGripes> oh, this guy
[5:17:48] <nexoosen> @Deft_Thought there is not, the group pat is in is big private

[5:17:56] <CptBritches> Get DEATHED on
[5:18:00] <+Bt_Robot> hey look, it's death!
[5:18:02] <Zombrocom> You don't really need friends for anything in warframe
[5:18:03] <Hydrapissed> use ur damn i FRame dash
[5:18:04] <AtlasMcCoy> Probably outdamage him
[5:18:10] <+seaearthandsky> thats a bold strategy cotton
[5:18:11] <Zombrocom> All you need is RHINO STRONKEST THAR EIS
[5:18:12] <$magikestral> @angriestpat the more stength upgrades you have, ths more health dreamwarriors have.
[5:18:13] <JusTTheGuyYouNeed> jesus
[5:18:15] <%Deft_Thought> @nexoosen Thanks
[5:18:19] <+Dimfish> fucking brute strength builds are the best
[5:18:19] <cerberuscarmine> nice
[5:18:19] <$Mendin> The PeachSaliva technique
[5:18:22] <$Mendin> Just faceram
[5:18:22] <nexoosen> @Zombrocom nah but a good group is always nice to play with
[5:18:27] <CptBritches> Poor guy
[5:18:27] <Estuko> :(
[5:18:28] <%Rostichenburg> Well I also got bored of very slow grinding
[5:18:30] <%stigna1> Awww, nooo. :*(
[5:18:30] <%PatNTheHat> I would like to point out he was beating you with his OWN DISMEMBERED ARM
[5:18:33] <AtlasMcCoy> BibleThump
[5:18:33] <Estuko> o7
[5:18:35] <ShawnEXE> King was an asshole
[5:18:36] <Zombrocom> True true
[5:18:36] <Donchalant402> @AngriestPat you have one area in this zone you never went to
[5:18:36] <dekkitout> glass him REALLY HARD
[5:18:42] <DesuDesuDokiDoki> o7
[5:18:42] <%deadpalvgz> Oh coo. I found out my air quality is WORSE THAN Washington state today.
[5:18:43] <Zombrocom> Lots of clan gated stuff too
[5:18:43] <Donchalant402> look at the map
[5:18:49] <Tisaric> Ohh man we're actually close
[5:18:50] <$magikestral> only 200 more to go for progress
[5:18:54] <$Mendin> It's 1800 essence to get thing, right?
[5:19:01] <Tisaric> yeah 1800
[5:19:02] <+Dimfish> yes
[5:19:02] <%stigna1> @Mendin Yeee
[5:19:05] <Hydrapissed> 1800
[5:19:06] <%Agami23> your only 200 away, one more dream boss like him will get you enough for that 1800
[5:19:07] <%Rostichenburg> And an essence tree
[5:19:07] <%TheImmortal70> "Oh yeah I have more stuff to do" TEN HOURS LATER
[5:19:15] <CptBritches> In the words of Plague, "FUCK THIS PLACE"
[5:19:23] <$magikestral> welp, gnight y'all. Not gonna stay up for the rest of this, but I'm glad to have been here for the rest
[5:19:24] <+G_Thunders> And then only another 15 hours of game!
[5:19:27] <Donchalant402> @AngriestPat maybe you should fight the Failed Knight to push yourself over 1800
[5:19:36] <%Rostichenburg> Not as much garbage here
[5:19:37] <DesuDesuDokiDoki> wooow
[5:19:38] <nexoosen> @magikestral Night! sleep well!
[5:19:40] <EMP_Ike_Turner> man I wish I had an armored face
[5:19:40] <missmariefanart> Probably because it's a deep dark hole and not rickety ladder town
[5:19:40] <Tisaric> It's like they took Blighttown and mixed it with Tomb of Giants and put spiders in there
[5:19:40] <CptBritches> That's fucking rad
[5:19:42] <thetechnicalraven> @deadpalvgz Washington State actually was a lot better today than it has been
[5:19:57] <$Mendin> But a large element of blighttown was bad design making it miserable. This thing was immaculately designed to be miserable which is why it owns
[5:20:00] <%Rostichenburg> Check the weavers den too
[5:20:01] <Kghaleon> dreamers too?
[5:20:01] <Hydrapissed> Infected with DA LIGHT
[5:20:05] <$Mendin> The Biocurse
[5:20:06] <Donchalant402> THE LIGHT
[5:20:06] <NerevaRising> did pat reach queen's garden yet?
[5:20:06] <Eresus> the LIGHT
[5:20:13] <%Agami23> remember when it took you 3 hits to kill those spiders?
[5:20:14] <%TheImmortal70> pat hasn't even TOUCHED QG
[5:20:15] <+Jaysky> AngriestPat , there is a dream boss back at City of Tears. The guy who teleported around and slammed his face into the ground that you beat with the winions.
[5:20:16] <nexoosen> @NerevaRising he has not
[5:20:16] <demolij> Chemicals in the water, turning them all gay
[5:20:16] <+Dimfish> no nervarising
[5:20:17] <thetechnicalraven> White evil Kappa
[5:20:19] <missmariefanart> I legitimately like Hollow Knight more than any Souls game
[5:20:19] <Luftraumm> dont get why nail arts aren't the most used skills
[5:20:23] <zal_silverfang> yeah, remember to re-check weaver's den
[5:20:27] <%TheImmortal70> Because they charge to slow
[5:20:28] <Donchalant402> @demolij I chuckled
[5:20:30] <dekkitout> cordyceps go way up
[5:20:36] <%TheImmortal70> The base nail slash plus quick nail plus unbreakable is just optimal
[5:20:36] <SchroedingersFerret> We really are the Hollow Knight
[5:20:36] <%deadpalvgz> @thetechnicalraven it's over 160 ppm where I live. That's as bad as the worst parts of seattle have been. I cannot see more than 200 feet in front of me.
[5:20:37] <%stigna1> From the miner girl, when dreamnailed; "... how much longer... KILL IT... how much longer... DANGEROUS... how much longer... KILL IT... how much longer... KILL THE EMPTY ONE... ...how much longer... must I dig...?"
[5:20:38] <cerberuscarmine> its the shrooms D:
[5:20:40] <AtlasMcCoy> The black marker i think
[5:20:45] <Mesonoxian_Methuselah> you put a marker there
[5:20:46] <Zanicedg> It's the mark.
[5:20:46] <nexoosen> weavers den is the pin on the map
[5:20:46] <%Divryne> It's that pin.
[5:20:46] <cerberuscarmine> THE SHROOMS
[5:20:47] <%Rostichenburg> That's what that pin is
[5:20:48] <nexoosen> to your right
[5:20:54] <asbestosflavored> it's lore
[5:20:59] <@PlagueOfGripes> whatever happened to magic in this playthrough
[5:21:00] <+Dimfish> @Luftraumm some people like waiting on charge attacks for planned attacks and some people just like to swing like cazy
[5:21:01] <+SWindleFeD> Yeah, I could dig a Paige Last of Us stream, watch get the shit scared out of her
[5:21:08] <+Bt_Robot> yarn balls on map
[5:21:13] <Hydrapissed> Magic is for plebs without a PURE nail
[5:21:17] <Jman409> Not the Black Marker
[5:21:30] <nexoosen> pat is not good enough for a magic build
[5:21:35] <%Rostichenburg> There'll be necromorphs everywhere
[5:21:36] <Donchalant402> @AngriestPat that pin was what you put down for the warrior's grave when you were still exploring and didnt fill in the map
[5:21:37] <zal_silverfang> super dash into attack on balcony
[5:21:37] <%TheImmortal70> @plagueofgripes It went to where Sunlight Spear went
[5:21:39] <Donchalant402> as a guess
[5:21:44] <%Rostichenburg> Nope
[5:21:53] <ShawnEXE> There's more here
[5:21:53] <nexoosen> I dont actually know what the deal is with this place since its dlc
[5:21:58] <%Rostichenburg> Breakable walls
[5:22:04] <$Tredecian> crystal dash
[5:22:09] <%TheImmortal70> This area hints at Hornet
[5:22:10] <asbestosflavored> do a soul shot at the wall across the gap on the top
[5:22:15] <%Rostichenburg> Dash over this hole and break the wall
[5:22:17] <cerberuscarmine> D:
[5:22:17] <Luftraumm> @dimfish yeah i guess but the charged attacks have so much oompf !
[5:22:17] <Hydrapissed> aka hornet
[5:22:18] <thetechnicalraven> @deadpalvgz Fuck, that sounds like actual shit. Which part of the state do you live in?
[5:22:24] <cerberuscarmine> that charm was for hornet
[5:22:27] <zal_silverfang> Dash over and attack wall
[5:22:28] <+Dimfish> his that wall up there pat
[5:22:46] <Mesonoxian_Methuselah> breakable wall where you crystal dashed too
[5:22:59] <%Rostichenburg> Hit the curved wall straight across the hole
[5:23:04] <$shadow1man9> @AngriestPat Dash over the gap at the top of the room and break the wall on the other side, it's easier if you have magic
[5:23:06] <Innocuous_Goat> So, Monster Hunter World has now shipped over 10 million copies (including digital)
[5:23:08] <Hunk_Of_Dunk> Hornet exists
[5:23:18] <Zanicedg> Stop before you hit the wall.
[5:23:18] <+Jaysky> I found nailmaster to be the most useful charm for the arena third part
[5:23:21] <%TheImmortal70> Gotta do it earlier
[5:23:29] <CptBritches> lmao
[5:23:32] <ShawnEXE> Oh that works out
[5:23:38] <ShawnEXE> shoot a charged shot
[5:23:39] <%stigna1> Oh wow, that's really hidden.
[5:23:40] <Donchalant402> oh what
[5:23:43] <Donchalant402> didnt know about this
[5:23:44] <nexoosen> Soul shot from the platform?
[5:23:48] <custoadian> use your spell?
[5:23:48] <%Rostichenburg> Keep breaking walls
[5:23:50] <DesuDesuDokiDoki> CHARGED SHOT
[5:23:52] <%TheImmortal70> Soul doesn't break walls
[5:23:57] <Luftraumm> nailmaster is the best charm in the game for me
[5:23:58] <ShawnEXE> Yes it does
[5:24:00] <nexoosen> I thought it did
[5:24:01] <DesuDesuDokiDoki> oh
[5:24:04] <%TheImmortal70> Does it?
[5:24:07] <%SmolBluGhost> oof thats an awkward
[5:24:09] <@PlagueOfGripes> not a fan of hidden walls
[5:24:11] <%TheImmortal70> I've never seen soul touch walls because of the huge ass hit boxes
[5:24:13] <%SmolBluGhost> howdy all
[5:24:14] <%whistlehunter> It did when he got into the hive
[5:24:18] <Rellim80> Shadow Bolt?
[5:24:21] <Hydrapissed> Plague not a fan of FUN!
[5:24:23] <%Rostichenburg> Super hidden
[5:24:25] <nexoosen> I remember bopping an enemy and discovering a wall by accident because of it
[5:24:27] <DesuDesuDokiDoki> ntr
[5:24:29] <zal_silverfang> @Donchalant402 yeah dude. watched a vinesauce stream of this and like every other turn there were people going "wait, what? when was that there??"
[5:24:34] <Estuko> Almost as though it were a plague of gripes
[5:24:37] <damienlunas> I guess that's why plague hates Dark Souls
[5:24:38] <%SmolBluGhost> ayeee
[5:24:39] <thetechnicalraven> Plague complaining go UP
[5:24:41] <%SmolBluGhost> you didi it
[5:24:43] <Mesonoxian_Methuselah> you can break it with a spell
[5:24:46] <Donchalant402> Plague hates anything that requires effort
[5:24:46] <%Rostichenburg> There's another hidden one in there
[5:24:49] <ShawnEXE> That's why it's just lore elements and not essential
[5:24:52] <AtlasMcCoy> BIG DEATH
[5:24:52] <Flyrant> what was it? I missed it
[5:24:53] <nexoosen> I like hidden walls but only if they are not very hidden at all
[5:24:55] <+seaearthandsky> thats a fun one
[5:24:55] <X3nobro> Plague's gripes
[5:24:55] <Rivalshotzgp> Bloodbornes hidden walls were extra aweful as they looked the same as the other 1000 walls
[5:24:57] <Jman409> I still think my favorite way to find hidden walls is humping the walls in Doom
[5:24:57] <Donchalant402> HOW
[5:24:57] <$Tredecian> true final boss
[5:24:58] <CptBritches> The fuck

[5:26:31] <Tisaric> Oh I'd love to see a Hat in Time stream too
[5:26:32] <Jman409> You right
[5:26:33] <Estuko> all those spiders in the background and foreground moving along with the screen makes me shudder, I lovei t.
[5:26:34] <%TheImmortal70> @plagueofgripes the map system ain't perfect, but once you get this game down you really don't need to see on the map where you are
[5:26:38] <%President_Miyazaki> Brother and Sister are rarely so alike without being twins.
[5:26:39] <@PlagueOfGripes> platformers range from decent to bad
[5:26:40] <damienlunas> For real though I'm with Plague on not liking secret walls that aren't decently telegraphed. That's why I hate Metroid 1.
[5:26:44] <dekkitout> its pretty easy to confuse the twins from on another
[5:26:51] <+ShinyMonger> But there's a tram so close
[5:26:54] <KaiserMario> Banjo is lame game for children
[5:26:55] <SatansDick1> @PlagueOfGripes just like dark souls
[5:27:05] <thetechnicalraven> @deadpalvgz Damn, I figured the ash would go more eastward. I live an hour away from Seattle and it's really clear here
[5:27:06] <%mister___doctor> Pat you're not teleporting your character is just moving really fast
[5:27:07] <IminyourBase> it's easy to confuse pat and paige. paige is hot and curvy and pat is short and bald.
[5:27:10] <asbestosflavored> never heal to full
[5:27:12] <%TheImmortal70> Dark souls should never have had platforming
[5:27:13] <SatansDick1> or star strek episodes'
[5:27:15] <Flyrant> I actually agree hidden walls are kind of lame, you either find them or you don't. It isn't fun running around hitting every wall
[5:27:20] <DracaenaLeaf> Platformers end up being some of my favorite games :(
[5:27:22] <cerberuscarmine> a hat in time is a good game for big doods
[5:27:23] <nexoosen> i dont know, i would consider hat in time to be a good game
[5:27:48] <ShawnEXE> If there's a reason why something is hidden then that's fine
[5:27:54] <CptBritches> YEYEYEYE
[5:27:54] <%stigna1> The fact that the wings come out even during your death animation hurt my soul during the Path.
[5:27:56] <Kghaleon> can't you shoot the bug?
[5:27:56] <Flyrant> path of pain will be good
[5:27:56] <DesuDesuDokiDoki> hahahahaha
[5:27:57] <+Jaysky> When the hidden walls are marked it's alright
[5:27:57] <missmariefanart> I've watched sbf for years and I've heard pat say several times he "hates" platformers because he's bad at them
[5:27:59] <%TheImmortal70> @angriestpat your double jump refreshes on spike pogo
[5:27:59] <SatansDick1> heal

[5:28:04] <Tisaric> Oh man a Pat/Paige co-op hat in time stream would be great
[5:28:05] <KaiserMario> Notice I didn't say the game was bad, just that it's lame and for children
[5:28:07] <asbestosflavored> 2nd hidden wall btw

[5:29:29] <missmariefanart> it's literally the wall that looks different
[5:29:33] <@PlagueOfGripes> do the obnoxious stupid technique you did before
[5:29:35] <nexoosen> having chat to help find walls must be so nice tbh, like, im terrified of missing any of the shit like this
[5:29:35] <Flyrant> absurdly hidden
[5:29:36] <%stigna1> The level of hidden here is pretty...uh...hidden.

[5:29:54] <leole11> no one knows
[5:29:55] <NerevaRising> future DLC
[5:29:55] <Mesonoxian_Methuselah> secret lore
[5:29:58] <%Rostichenburg> I missed a wall that makes a boss fight way easier
[5:29:59] <ShawnEXE> what it look like
[5:30:01] <SatansDick1> future dlc
[5:30:03] <%TheImmortal70> Probably going to be for Hornet's campaign
[5:30:04] <Donchalant402> Hornet DLC maybe?
[5:30:04] <%Divryne> Probably Hornet Campain start area.
[5:30:04] <dekkitout> is this another of your beloved darksouls references?
[5:30:05] <asbestosflavored> a hornet weaving
[5:30:07] <+Gorgen> Sex ending unlocked
[5:30:07] <Flyrant> it is nothing
[5:30:08] <SaltBuster> Does he need timestop?
[5:30:08] <$Tredecian> implied hornet room
[5:30:08] <+SergeEXE> The DLC's done
[5:30:09] <+greenfall> Hornet DLC probably
[5:30:10] <+BurncoatRapscallion> I'd love if this was the entrance to Hornet's campaign
[5:30:12] <leole11> it's maybe a hornet weaving?
[5:30:13] <demolij> Does anyone even know what it means
[5:30:13] <+SergeEXE> oh right Hornet
[5:30:14] <%stigna1> I know what that is, but why is it there?
[5:30:15] <%Sirculbs> Probably involved in the Hornet DLC
[5:30:15] <Hydrapissed> sex ending unlocked
[5:30:18] <CptBritches> That will be the Hornet DLC mode
[5:30:18] <Estuko> Hornet's room? a girl's room, aka secret gardens.
[5:30:21] <Kghaleon> It be a waste of time
[5:30:22] <%stigna1> Ohhhhhh, I know what that does!
[5:30:23] <Zanicedg> In the code it's called "Hornet's Room".
[5:30:27] <thetechnicalraven> Sexual intercourse go UP
[5:30:34] <cerberuscarmine> sex up hornet go up

[5:30:48] <+Jaysky> Would you fug a bug?
[5:30:52] <bambowl> fuck im outta milk and frosted flakes!!
[5:30:57] <CptBritches> Any game with a bug sex room is game of the year
[5:30:57] <Estuko> @Jaysky if she cute
[5:30:57] <dekkitout> isnt ciaran's animal a hornet
[5:31:04] <%Spydurman> nothing but bugs to fuck in the south
[5:31:06] <+Bt_Robot> You need the love key
[5:31:07] <+Jaysky> Is Hornet a cute?
[5:31:07] <arkv01> bugs outnumber us by a trillion times
[5:31:08] <%Rostichenburg> He's actually pretty close
[5:31:09] <AtlasMcCoy> Considering everything paige is into she'd be down for the bug sex room too
[5:31:09] <%SmolBluGhost> bug island must've been heaven then
[5:31:09] <Hydrapissed> its the souths fault
[5:31:11] <%Divryne> Y'all horny for Hornet.
[5:31:12] <Parapattern> It just be like that sometimes
[5:31:12] <arkv01> and they're ALL HAVING SEX
[5:31:13] <Cthulou> I like the look of this game but do these ‘hidden walls’ extend to the critical path as well? If so that’s a deal breaker for me
[5:31:14] <Mesonoxian_Methuselah> when you think about it, the entire earth is just one giant bug sex room
[5:31:14] <+GraphicNoodles> How's it going Pat?
[5:31:16] <zal_silverfang> i love how Plague is the one who gets called out for the bug sex room when he was just repeating what chat was saying
[5:31:16] <cerberuscarmine> hornet is a super cute
[5:31:19] <Estuko> @Jaysky yeh
[5:31:22] <Zanicedg> No it wasn't.
[5:31:24] <missmariefanart> the bugs in HK are pretty hot
[5:31:28] <+Jaysky> Then I guess you fug
[5:31:31] <AzureSkyKnight> Maybe one day, Plague will draw a sexy Mantis lady
[5:31:32] <%Rostichenburg> No hidden walls on the critical path
[5:31:35] <nexoosen> @PlagueOfGripes Did you see the sekiro demo by the way?
[5:31:38] <asbestosflavored> crazy talk
[5:31:40] <%Sirculbs> Not bugs, arachnids
[5:31:41] <Zanicedg> @AngriestPat You just didn't go this way.
[5:31:42] <%Rostichenburg> This wasn't sealed off you just never went here
[5:31:53] <Tisaric> fuck you wendy's fries and a frosty is the best shit
[5:31:55] <Endocrom> Fries and frosty is GREAT
[5:31:59] <knomad2b> u ever did frys in a shake pat? its great
[5:32:01] <Donchalant402> why would pat be cool enough
[5:32:02] <asbestosflavored> LUL
[5:32:04] <Shastafield> you never had that pat?
[5:32:08] <Hydrapissed> Fries and frosty sounds like POOP
[5:32:16] <+Jaysky> Dipping fries into frosties is the only way to eat them
[5:32:16] <dekkitout> incoming fries and frosties white knights
[5:32:17] <%Agami23> wendys is shit tier until they bring back spicy nuggets
[5:32:24] <rosemon5001> out of spite i think
[5:32:28] <leole11> because you are a coward
[5:32:28] <missmariefanart> you dip the fries in the frosty
[5:32:31] <thetechnicalraven> I fuck hard with Wendy's nuggets
[5:32:33] <Tisaric> they do need to bring back spicy nuggets though
[5:32:45] <NerevaRising> mask maker?
[5:32:45] <%Divryne> LUL
[5:32:46] <thetechnicalraven> Those are the best motherfucking nuggets
[5:32:51] <Hunk_Of_Dunk> There weren't stag stations in the bottom half of the map before DLC
[5:32:54] <%Rostichenburg> Get ready for weirdo
[5:32:54] <%SmolBluGhost> its kind of a problem being able to order wendys whenever tho despite them being so damn good
[5:32:58] <@PlagueOfGripes> Wendy's is the best of the universal fast food places
[5:33:01] <bambowl> who dips fries into anything thats not ketchup
[5:33:02] <DesuDesuDokiDoki> lol
[5:33:12] <thetechnicalraven> I fucking hate ketchup honestly
[5:33:13] <+Jaysky> People with taste bambowl
[5:33:14] <nexoosen> fries and mayo kinda works
[5:33:14] <leole11> ketchup is gross
[5:33:14] <%Rostichenburg> Fries in soft serve is great
[5:33:15] <SaltBuster> fries into a McFlurry is pretty good
[5:33:16] <missmariefanart> wendy's has good fries, their burgers kinda suck
[5:33:17] <dekkitout> a good sign of fast food is their twitter account
