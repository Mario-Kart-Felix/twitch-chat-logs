[0:18:50] <%Birdigalore> @PatStaresAt He can create rifts in the ground that, if ppl run over them,. he can teleport them to a cage, which acts like a hook but he doesn't have to carry ppl to it
[0:18:50] <+michingmallecho> He’ll take you and he’ll give you the 1-2
[0:18:54] <HalloweenHangover> Immediate hooking, but it's in a cage instead.

[0:46:56] <%CommanderSqueaks> @jetsfantasy Yes, but you can also just smack his face and arms, but it's significantly harder and there's literally no reason to do that.

[0:48:02] <%13ry4n93> 13ry4n93 subscribed at Tier 1. They've subscribed for 10 months, currently on a 9 month streak! hey Pat, apropos of nothing but is there anything less calming than hearing a voice projected over a loudspeaker saying "please remain calm"?
[0:48:08] <%ChrisPlaysThing> They are likely sweaty from lack of AC since theirs broke and we're having a hell of a heatwave in montreal @DaBigVitus

[0:52:14] <wix964> Wow, I can't believe how much Elmo sounds like Pat!
[0:52:16] <Paperware> WOW! I can't believe Pat Animorphed into Elmo
[0:52:18] <tuesti> new to this, what is the point of the mod? like what does it do?
[0:52:28] <%CommanderSqueaks> @anceldelambert Funny thing, I never thought about 'level ranges' in Dark Souls. I would always just run in, hit something, and if I did piss all damage I ran away from that area until later. XD
[0:52:32] <jdanov> and honestly who DOESN'T want a crab friend
[0:52:32] <nuane> he does't know waynerSob
[0:52:32] <Shishi1205> Eat gundyrs
[0:52:34] <swipperswapper> wow, i cant believe elmo ate pat
[0:52:37] <$Kuro_Koshka> Lightning arrow works til the end of the game
[0:52:39] <JetpackMcQuack> I endorse elmo cam
[0:52:39] <DXLelouch24> @patstaresat insanity catalyst needs 60 int and faith btw
[0:52:42] <+TitaniumDragoonNeo> @jdanov Yes. Pat had a fit and updated it just as the stream began.
[0:52:42] <%dekkitout> Cinders adds a metric assload of qol
[0:52:49] <$Kuro_Koshka> Miarcles are busted though because you can use physical or lightning
[0:52:50] <jdanov> woohoo!
[0:52:51] <Ultimatefool> @tuesti Adds a shitload of weapons, spells, rebalances everything. Adds some warps between areas so you can go different routes now
[0:52:52] <%EatTheB0otyLikeGroceries> ohnKoji ohnKoji ohnKoji ohnKoji ohnKoji ohnKoji
[0:52:54] <%DedlokPM> @tuesti total overhaul of the game. for people that want a new experience in something familiar
[0:52:54] <%GraceTBM> @tuesti makes magic more viable and refill, provides shortcuts from many areas to other, qol, lots of items from other fromsoft games
[0:53:15] <MayorRev> BIG number
[0:53:17] <Shishi1205> Do you have enough twinkling?
[0:53:17] <%Nobrev> LUL
[0:53:17] <%PaladinDupre> Level up Faith more
[0:53:17] <+dark_kebabs> @patstaresat did you see pyramid head in dead by daylight?
[0:53:18] <nuane> LUL
[0:53:19] <Krothar> The Mana refill felt so dirty at first but its very nice.
[0:53:20] <+LeaIsChill> omg is he just min maxing
[0:53:23] <%BeatBo_2> Big NUMBER

[0:53:34] <%za7az> 3
[0:53:34] <tuesti> @GraceTBM @DedlokPM @Ultimatefool ah thank you!
[0:53:35] <$galaxyswirl> probably need more faith
[0:53:38] <nuane> try 30/30
[0:53:38] <CherrieVelvet> need more faith?
[0:53:40] <Dao_Puppy> What would you do without us.
[0:53:42] <%CommanderSqueaks> Need more Lucky Faith
[0:53:44] <%logoth_> She's hot
[0:53:45] <%cvp5127> its opposite day
[0:53:46] <Velkin999> Bruh Pyramid Head!
[0:53:46] <%dekkitout> It's pronounced "du-mah"
[0:53:53] <Ultimatefool> I can't believe that cat just called us dumbasses
[0:53:54] <DXLelouch24> And i have more faith
[0:54:06] <%Ragnvaldr_AGH> it's because int/faith aren't the same
[0:54:12] <Krothar> 30 Int 30 Faith?
[0:54:16] <SpaceCatStation> I can't believe Elmo is playing DS3 and also sounds just like Pat
[0:54:25] <Scrub_Seeker> @PatStaresAt it'd be better to test damage on the skeleton in firelink, it has no resistances and those slug dudes are probably dark resistant
[0:54:25] <%Ragnvaldr_AGH> need to be basically the same # because it scales off both, but the lower of the 2
[0:54:29] <$Kuro_Koshka> Angelic Barrage might be the most busted spell in Cinders, it one shots bosses for 10k damage easily
[0:54:31] <%CommanderSqueaks> It's different putting Pyramid Head in a crossover game than putting it in every single Silent Hill game after 2.
[0:54:33] <Draco_Renegade> Are people actually already complaining?
[0:54:34] <nuane> bubble nurses are too hot for FBF
[0:54:35] <%taku_toots> yeahyeah yeah
[0:54:37] <%PaladinDupre> @PatStaresAt if you wanna respec to an INT heavy dark build, strongly consider getting the Soul Greatsword spell that gives you an almost 360 spin soul version of abyssal edge
[0:54:37] <Shishi1205> Damn RTX is really cutting off Paige
[0:54:38] <+Swiglou> LOL
[0:54:39] <NeroInfinite> I'm sad about the silent hill DLC because konami has killed silent hillas a franchise.
[0:54:39] <%kewlmyc> It's a crossover, who give a fuck about "canon"
[0:54:40] <SaltyAzteca> *snort*
[0:54:41] <+charlie2089> !time
[0:54:42] <+GenesisKnight> It's weird that they have her down as Cheryl instead of Heather
[0:54:43] <%valriot> Did Paige just create an OTP?
[0:54:45] <%baronblank> there are unique weapons you get from infusing certain weapons with certain infusions in cinders, right? is there a list of those somewhere?
[0:54:46] <%dekkitout> LuvUok
[0:54:46] <%Shadicara> LUL
[0:54:48] <DXLelouch24> @patstaresat dark scalled with int and faith not one or the other,explains why im one shotting Irithyll enemies
[0:54:48] <Zombrocom> It doesn't scale off the lower guys
[0:54:49] <%IncredibleMeh> dammit I can't hear Paige not making sense
[0:54:49] <+Delenay> paiges laugh when she knows shes being silly
[0:54:54] <Krothar> Ye test it in Firelink
[0:54:54] <%xcompleasedad> RTX is muting her HARD
[0:54:59] <%nofestu2> excuse me
[0:54:59] <horfenico> yo is that cat just
[0:55:01] <horfenico> sitting there
[0:55:04] <%YakumoYomi> Wait...IGN's tweet mentions "Cheryl Mason". Am I missing something?
[0:55:04] <%Coystick> The wrong way
[0:55:04] <horfenico> actually
[0:55:07] <%dekkitout> RTX can't even with Paige

[0:55:19] <%Agami23> i like to imagine harry is cheering on heather from the UFO as she does dead by daylight
[0:55:22] <%CommanderSqueaks> Wait, if they're adding Pyramid Head, are they adding James as a survivor?
[0:55:23] <trianglehat> Paige you need to become human
[0:55:24] <fart_bath> can't believe pat is a coward and doesn't want to min/max to the best ability you can. afraid of what magical builds would open up if he would just open his mind.
[0:55:25] <Monkey_D_Judd> Thats by design.
[0:55:25] <DXLelouch24> We can hear you Paige your drunk
[0:55:25] <%valriot> RTX aint having that Pyramid Head fanfic
[0:55:26] <Jetsfantasy> You're fine, also you can adjust the suppression
[0:55:26] <+Midashu> Paige needs to speak more often, so RTX can learn her voice and pay attention to her
[0:55:27] <wix964> You're fine, Pat's sister
[0:55:27] <Shishi1205> But when your voice Varies you get cutted off

[0:56:10] <%Maids4lyfe> that's some beautiful regen
[0:56:19] <Shishi1205> Try to get a dark hand so we can see that abysal hand shit
[0:56:19] <%PaladinDupre> You should go to the Church of Sin
[0:56:20] <%Bluwizard21> @PatStaresAt Lightning faith builds are extremely viable now.
[0:56:23] <DXLelouch24> I prefer my big damage
[0:56:30] <%CommanderSqueaks> It mutes Peach, but RTX cannot resist THE BOY.

[0:56:40] <j0ustar> RTX= doesn't filter Elmo, filters Paige
[0:56:41] <DXLelouch24> Abyssal hand doesnt work ive tested it
[0:56:48] <%cureneckbeard> cotive
[0:56:48] <%trustycoyote> Yup. Rocking a paladin build now. BIG strength and Faith
[0:56:48] <jdanov> just wait til he gets Great Soul Dregs and one-shots people from orbit

[0:56:55] <%PaladinDupre> @Bluwizard21 i made a Solaire build, real fun
[0:56:57] <Krothar> Elmo can't be filtered
[0:56:57] <%dekkitout> *octave
[0:56:57] <rafaelba93> everything is at least good now
[0:57:03] <DXLelouch24> I am one shotting Irithyll,explain that?
[0:57:07] <%YakumoYomi> @hero346 Ah, I looked it up after you mentioned it. I had forgotten the lore.
[0:57:11] <DXLelouch24> With pure dark
[0:57:11] <%cureneckbeard> psaBig number
[0:57:14] <corpsegoo> if nothing else, regarding the DBD silent hill dlc, I appreciate the immediate nope sensation of seeing pyramid head approaching you with that kind of speed
[0:57:15] <Higaraishi> walk up the side
[0:57:15] <Ultimatefool> Faith builds are fucking busted. Wrath of gods is almost instant cast with an ascended catalyst, it's hilarious
[0:57:16] <swipperswapper> you walk up teh path and you chokepoint them
[0:57:17] <%PaladinDupre> @PatStaresAt you gotta be a big man and kill the skellys
[0:57:17] <%trustycoyote> Talk to her first earlier in the dungeon @PatStaresAt
[0:57:19] <Scrub_Seeker> @DXLelouch24 stuff in irythll is weak to dark
[0:57:24] <42nfl19> Is @PatStaresAt not feeling pretty today hence Elmo cam?
[0:57:25] <%Nekros4442> @DXLelouch24 just let him to his thing lol
[0:57:29] <Zombrocom> Because dark scales with int + faith, and enchanted infusion boosts spell buff, so you get more overall damage thanks to that
[0:57:29] <jowi_time> what happened to your camera?
[0:57:30] <%vectorless_peon> psa1guy
[0:57:34] <Shishi1205> Kill the skellies

[0:57:42] <DXLelouch24> @scrub_seeker smouldered was easy too
[0:57:44] <Jetsfantasy> There's a path
[0:57:44] <digaogrunge> kill the skeletons
[0:57:47] <%Bluwizard21> go to tghe left from the bridgfe
[0:57:47] <DesertPenguin> Elmo cam is fun but wouldn't we rather see the game fullscreen for good view?
[0:57:48] <MonsieurZero> don't you find anri in catacombs first?
[0:57:51] <rafaelba93> path near wall
[0:57:51] <jowi_time> ah, makes sense
[0:57:52] <%SmoothEnigma> there's a path up on the other side of the bridge genuis
[0:57:53] <%Nobrev> BUCK ASS NAKED
[0:57:54] <+Qsmash_> is elmo dead?
[0:57:54] <MayorRev> lewd
[0:57:55] <katocrimson> pat is naked?

[0:57:58] <j0ustar> [ L E W D ]
[0:57:58] <%CommanderSqueaks> Pat doesn't think we'd be able to handle the ORB, so he's saving us from ourselves.
[0:58:00] <wannabemoogle> The Orb is free then?
[0:58:02] <%Bluwizard21> @PatStaresAt go to the path to the left off the bridge
[0:58:03] <Shishi1205> Usually you go to her from behind
[0:58:03] <%Shadicara> Naked pat on stream for a power move
[0:58:04] <DesertPenguin> Twitch would ban him if he showed naked orb
[0:58:06] <+Midashu> Hot Pat would blind the average twitch viewer. Against terms of service afterall
[0:58:08] <Scrub_Seeker> @DXLelouch24 ghru are also weak to dark, as are black knights
[0:58:09] <LordOfThePoultry> show the tits you coward
[0:58:09] <Shishi1205> not from the bridge
[0:58:10] <Monkey_D_Judd> Show us you MILK DUDS!!

[0:58:16] <%arancet> to look upon the orb is to go mad, just look at paige
[0:58:18] <42nfl19> ah yes, no moobs on stream
[0:58:18] <%YakumoYomi> Just survive the Bone Zone and talk to Anri.
[0:58:20] <MayorRev> SHOW THE ORB
[0:58:22] <jowi_time> aww so no gun show?
[0:58:24] <Jetsfantasy> Pat has white sweaty orb equipped instead
[0:58:25] <%CommanderSqueaks> Also, Peach would probably reach through the stream and blind us, only she can see the ORB.
[0:58:26] <DesertPenguin> Is it really that hot?

[1:00:13] <cherrycottontail> Hey Pat when are you streaming Minecraft Dungeons? sipsipHellmo it's included with gamepass
[1:00:17] <NeroInfinite> they are still a thing
[1:00:17] <DXLelouch24> Thats aoe too
[1:00:21] <%baronblank> that spell looks really good
[1:00:21] <%SomeSageAdvice> @CommanderSqueaks no they are
[1:00:25] <%LiquidDinosaur> SKELETON BALL
[1:00:25] <Scrub_Seeker> @PatStaresAt it also has massive AOE, try it on the skeleton horde
[1:00:30] <ScreamLord> SKELETON WARRIORS!
[1:00:30] <GMKGoat> Is the Catacombs Crab still in the skeleton ball?
[1:00:30] <Shishi1205> Thats the best type of pyro
[1:00:31] <%CommanderSqueaks> SKELETON WARRIOR
[1:00:33] <Sotetsu> @patstaresat Did you see that the new Dead By Killer is Pyramid Head? tangRowdy
[1:00:38] <%DedlokPM> @CommanderSqueaks they are still a thing but they can be disabled. dunno if pat disabled it or not
[1:00:39] <%CommanderSqueaks> How did those gifts not trigger a hype train?
[1:00:39] <CrypticMochi> Would the rock vomit spell murder the bone zone?
[1:00:54] <Shishi1205> Open that barrier my dude @PatStaresAt
[1:01:00] <Shishi1205> There's a lever?
[1:01:03] <%dekkitout> Who would win, magic black fire, or one spherical mass of skeletons
[1:01:05] <+LilNatFour> Oh no! Look out for the skeleton ball!
[1:01:06] <Valentinius_Anodyne> Probably too short of a time from the last Hype Train
[1:01:13] <%optimasmaximas> LUL
[1:01:13] <Shishi1205> my bad
[1:01:15] <%Jaxnos> Elmo has gotten really good at Dark Souls
[1:01:21] <GMKGoat> Get the lever handle
[1:01:23] <+Lillowh> No camera today?
[1:01:24] <jowi_time> you gotta use the wrench pat
[1:01:24] <Krothar> lobosCool
[1:01:32] <%DedlokPM> @Lillowh too hot
[1:01:33] <+Erimos> Skeleton Man, Skeleton Man, does whatever a skeleton can.
[1:01:35] <%PaladinDupre> Alluring Skulls might help distract the skeleton Hoard, solaire too
[1:01:43] <%trustycoyote> @PatStaresAt Looked it up. Seems Anri has moved on to the Church of Yorshka. You have the warp if you want to check to see if she's there.
[1:01:44] <swipperswapper> @Lillowh as you can see elmo is pat now
[1:01:50] <nuane> incredible that elmo can play dark souls at all, much less telepathically
[1:01:51] <+LilNatFour> no but open it though
[1:02:02] <%chambatron> Thanks for the sub @WheatlyXT
[1:02:04] <Krothar> Solaire would doestroy that horde
[1:02:04] <%Jaxnos> that lever is an endgame secret. you have to input the konami code after no-hitting Pontiff Sulyvahn
[1:02:06] <tsb_gorilla> Paige can you read the bee movie script
[1:02:10] <jowi_time> said the rat
[1:02:22] <%optimasmaximas> LUL

[1:02:41] <%Maids4lyfe> it is
[1:02:42] <%LiquidDinosaur> i love how Bonewheel Skeleons do the Akira slide
[1:02:43] <Shishi1205> Is it me or do the Wheel skeletons do the Akira drift everytime
[1:02:43] <%PaladinDupre> @Krothar in my experience he is at best a distraction to them, they tend to stunlock
[1:02:43] <%Jaxnos> but think of the juicy youtube poop videos that could be born, Pat
[1:02:44] <@SoFarFetched> Yeah there's a trailer for Pyramid Head

[1:06:18] <%LiquidDinosaur> @aishman its super hot and he has no AC so he's shirtless rn and he's sparing us the horror
[1:06:18] <Paperware> Or maybe Pat was Elmo this whole time...
[1:06:19] <Valentinius_Anodyne> Pat's too cowardly for Boulder, I understand
[1:06:21] <%FallenAngelZelos> More avatar references

[1:56:51] <+regurgitatedmemes> did you know you can block the lava damage by holding up your shield
[1:56:52] <%WheatlyXT> the one time he swings his sword is when Vestiges would be the best
[1:56:55] <zamzoph> technically, isn't this whole area a waste of time?
[1:56:55] <olm46> Where's the giant rat that makes all of the rules?
[1:56:56] <StillTrynaGetAHandbeezy> yes, you have to stack fire absorption gear and flash sweat and chug estus the whole way through the room and you can survive
[1:57:09] <%PlagueOfGripes> yeah, basically. this area is horrible
[1:57:17] <%xemnahort> I heard that special sound
[1:57:20] <%LiquidDinosaur> Don't be a coward suicide run for those items
[1:57:20] <FodderAplenty> Pat why am i staring at a pic of your cat spreading it

[1:57:22] <+Erimos> Good job, Pat

[1:57:23] <%CommanderSqueaks> How dare a game make me use the mechanics the game has.
[1:57:26] <$sniffy77> its not a waste of time if ur having fun! so this area is a waste of time
[1:57:26] <%PlagueOfGripes> but that's most of dark 3's areas, so you kind of just have to roll with it
[1:57:31] <PrinceOfEden> Pat is looking FLUFFY today.
[1:57:34] <%Ascethetic> @patstaresat the second lava room has a catalyst in the chest if you want it

[2:15:00] <%Undenizen> it's always good to ask these questions WHILE YOU'RE FALLING
[2:15:02] <%heartlesshealer> Maybe the chest was the friends we made along the way
[2:15:06] <restingbones> the only Hit point that matters is the last one.
[2:15:08] <$Dakuu75> I wonder if I didn't find DS3 fun because I tried to play it like bloodborn
[2:15:10] <%WheatlyXT> what's the point of the red crystal lizard?
[2:15:11] <Rob_has_nice_nipples> 😂
[2:15:12] <%moogleboy1984> This is making me regret my 100 Dex, Scythe only build
[2:15:14] <KaiserMario> @PatStaresAt That Alluring Skull used to be a weapon, so I'm sorry I expected to be something else... LUL
[2:15:15] <dinnydanny777> The chest was inside us all along

[2:16:32] <Shishi1205> you mean common
[2:16:32] <$TheYharnamTheorem> What do you expect from ELDEN RING, Pat? I think it's going to be easier and more "casual friendly" with lots of difficult optional content.
[2:16:39] <%moogleboy1984> also, straight up fuck Archdragon Peak in this mod
[2:16:39] <%Jaxnos> nice
[2:16:41] <%heartlesshealer> they have to get someone to come to the inside of the house to fix the AC at some point and I'm big worried
[2:16:43] <dinnydanny777> You should need the cat ring
[2:16:44] <%Undenizen> wait, why turn it back on?
[2:16:52] <nuane> Elden ring will be bad screencap this post
[2:16:54] <Shishi1205> to brea a wall
[2:16:55] <venomfury86> is this Anor Londo?

[2:16:58] <%Jaxnos> what a freaking angle that thing has
[2:17:02] <DXLelouch24> You forgot to turn it back off
[2:17:04] <%SirGO0SE> elden ring will never come out
[2:17:11] <PrinceOfEden> I have one request of Elden Ring, keep the story in game and not just a bunch of item descriptions.
[2:17:19] <Dr_Suddenboner> you look even more like a pussy than usual
[2:17:20] <dinnydanny777> What even is Elden Ring, really
[2:17:25] <%heartlesshealer> cool
[2:17:25] <%rumtumtugnutz> Elden Ring has no choice at this point but to be terrible.
[2:17:26] <olm46> Elden ring's name is a reference to GRRM's butt, which will be displayed live on stage.

[2:17:51] <%rumtumtugnutz> Thursday
[2:17:55] <restingbones> Wish the hat didn't clip through your body.
[2:18:11] <dinnydanny777> It's kind of like the Sekiro hat
[2:18:13] <Arisato_II> Not enough cash, stranger
[2:18:13] <DXLelouch24> @etheralflamex or he can get the ashes in Irithyll and just forge them
[2:18:19] <%SirGO0SE> 4? mistaS
[2:18:23] <Dr_Suddenboner> elden ring and bayo 3 to release on the same day? atpCap
[2:18:35] <THELava_lad> 4!!!!!!!!!!!
[2:18:35] <%heartlesshealer> applying the game's physics to the hat would probably make it worse than clipping
[2:18:36] <%moogleboy1984> go for the triple, release HL3 too
[2:18:43] <PrinceOfEden> Remember when Bayo 3 and Bablyon's fall was scheduled for 2019 MiniK

[2:19:17] <Scrub_Seeker> @WheatlyXT yes, it boosts soul gain
[2:19:18] <%EtheralFlameX> you can put the greed infuse on the shield of want for even more souls

[2:28:35] <$lotharrio> I lived in Texas for about a year. It's illegal to turn people's power off during the summer because it's basically committing manslaughter.
[2:28:36] <dinnydanny777> Charging in headfirst
[2:28:37] <+Erimos> @JumboCrunchies seems to be working fine for Pat.
[2:28:39] <+viewtifulbr0> how are the covenant items so far ?
[2:28:44] <Shishi1205> That seems obnoxious

[2:28:54] <%PaladinDupre> old bonfire
[2:28:59] <%JumboCrunchies> But Pat is smart and strong, where I am dumb and weak.
[2:28:59] <Zombrocom> @PatStaresAt If you keep backtracking to that pitch dark warehouse, there is another dark tome
[2:29:00] <%CommanderSqueaks> @patstaresat Aren't all businesses in Montreal required to follow certain health precautions in order to remain operating?

[2:30:44] <venomfury86> Evil Within 3?
[2:30:45] <%YakumoYomi> @SoFarFetched I know having strangers in my home is unsettling (regardless of any pandemic).

[3:01:23] <%optimasmaximas> @GarettLefebvre 26C in farhenheit is 78, that's not even that bad i cant believe they act like they're melting
[3:01:23] <+gkingsausagelink> youre actualy hot like that
[3:01:25] <fruit_pie_the_magician> I lived in FL for 20 years, 95+ every single day and like 85 percent humidity. With maybe about a month in the winter that is actually below 85 all the time

[3:01:37] <+Kataiser> Someone make that Remerai Pat as a FaceRig avatar for times like this
[3:01:37] <GarettLefebvre> @optimasmaximas I didn't ask
[3:01:38] <+auspiciousdgg> @Shishi1205 Either Pat used two separate systems of measurements or he's a madman
[3:01:51] <chronoxgp> yeah florida is fun in winter, any other time nah
[3:01:52] <Shishi1205> He said he has about 80 F
[3:01:52] <rafaelba93> where do you get black fire vestiges? cant find it
[3:01:58] <hectic_harlequin> Yep
[3:02:00] <%heartlesshealer> because cast speed on already-fast spells seems fun

[3:02:51] <%optimasmaximas> @GarettLefebvre you asked what 18C was, when pat mentioned 18C he alos mentioned the current temp in there, so i provided you with the farhenheit equivalent of that as well
[3:02:53] <%Coystick> Put on his Pants!!!!
[3:02:59] <dinnydanny777> Pursuer will be right outside the last fog gate

[3:03:21] <%heartlesshealer> for looks
[3:03:22] <+auspiciousdgg> It does make sense that he meant 18C but it's still weird how he went back and forth between F and C
[3:03:23] <fruit_pie_the_magician> In my opinion the pursuer should be more resistant to dark
[3:03:27] <%Coystick> Curses
[3:03:27] <dalishprince> but fahsion?

[3:16:53] <Scrub_Seeker> @PatStaresAt it does the same thing as normal but it doesn't transform you
[3:16:59] <%heartlesshealer> you scroll through your items so weirdly
[3:17:06] <+Erimos> infinite use item, i think
[3:17:07] <%optimasmaximas> @galaxyswirl god that's so good, might be even better than when tv tokyo or whoever tf dmca'd vids on yt with a bot, and then when they started posting episodes to their own channel their own bot shut the channel down LUL
[3:17:13] <Scrub_Seeker> you just need an empty helmet slot to use it
[3:17:29] <SumKnowBuddy> that model isnt ripped form bloodborne. its custom.
[3:17:37] <%SirGO0SE> @heartlesshealer eyes probably arent where cursor is, people accuse me of that too
[3:17:44] <Admiral_PopnFresh> @PatStaresAt I saw you Paige and Plague watch the Data bed time scene in TNG, twas gold

[3:18:41] <Admiral_PopnFresh> christ the FP recharge! what's doing that?
[3:18:50] <%heartlesshealer> @SirGO0SE probably, but pat also frequently scrolls over the item he's looking for like he doesn't see the word change at the top and it... it hit brain bad
[3:18:51] <+auspiciousdgg> Did that nun just rip a fat vape?
[3:18:51] <%YakumoYomi> It's passive.
[3:18:53] <Shishi1205> you missed the elevator btw
[3:18:54] <+tigerfang86> pat used his WORDS
[3:18:57] <+tigerfang86> didnt you HEAR THEM
[3:18:59] <Shishi1205> No you didnt
[3:19:02] <Shishi1205> Im dumb
[3:19:07] <+Kataiser> FP recharge is percentage of max, so having high Attunement gives you more mana back per second.
[3:19:07] <+ItsCaptainDisco> Open it, Pat, open the key
[3:19:09] <%SirGO0SE> @heartlesshealer youre right im giving him too much credit Kappa
[3:19:10] <Peyote_> I think rings can also affect how fast the FP charges
[3:19:14] <+kapcommunist> James Bond? More like Barry Bond
[3:19:15] <+Kataiser> Big attunement give big return
[3:19:15] <chronoxgp> jannies key ring
[3:19:17] <%CommanderSqueaks> Pat can no longer distract us with his orb, so he must now use his WORDS.

[3:19:47] <%CommanderSqueaks> @kralec Better than that HACK PatStaresAt
[3:19:52] <+KENTASHIRO> He's good at DS3, he's BAD at DS2 though
[3:19:53] <%WheatlyXT> After watching Pat and Paige play for years, Elmo knows all the things NOT to do
[3:19:56] <James_Quivers> GOOLEAHA
[3:19:58] <dinnydanny777> A l33t gamer if you will

[3:20:12] <Shishi1205> Twinkies
[3:20:19] <+lethallylactic> It respawns named enemy NPCs.
[3:20:20] <+NitronStreams> The truth is pat got sick of the game and gave the controls to elmo
[3:20:21] <+KENTASHIRO> Blood of Might lets you re-fight the named NPCs
[3:20:22] <%SirGO0SE> i did a stream for the first time in awhile yesterday that was 4.5 hours and i was muted for 15 minutes bc i didnt read chat :(
[3:20:26] <+RandomMishaps> Have you played Legends of Runeterra before? I know you're playing it on Thursday.

[3:20:53] <dreu81> REKT
[3:20:59] <chronoxgp> soul of the lost of the strength might be mended
[3:21:00] <Valentinius_Anodyne> Does Greirat sell them yet?
[3:21:01] <TheSwitchback> Okay SO I just watched a video on this mod. No spoilers I promise but wow this mod. Anyway
[3:21:02] <Scrub_Seeker> @PatStaresAt dont forget to check andre's shop, probably nothing you're going to use but his inventory updates when you give the shrine maiden ashes
[3:21:09] <Admiral_PopnFresh> voice of an angel
[3:21:14] <+Quack_of_Dawn> So how's the online in Cinders work without just getting you banned?
[3:21:16] <FutaSnek> @YakumoYomi Goblin Vtuber PogChamp
[3:21:22] <%SirGO0SE> i havent stopped laughing about it tbh. its so funny being on the other end of that jape @heartlesshealer
[3:21:24] <%heartlesshealer> I say this as I obsess over visible background elements such as chests because I can't not see things
[3:21:30] <%CommanderSqueaks> @quack_of_dawn You get soft-banned, so you're stuck playing with other modders.
[3:21:35] <+Quack_of_Dawn> ah
[3:21:42] <+lethallylactic> @Quack_of_Dawn You get put in cheater jail to play with everyone else modding/cheating.
[3:21:43] <dinnydanny777> Astora Straight Sword sounds good

[3:22:48] <+tigerfang86> you need MORE POWER
[3:22:54] <+Quack_of_Dawn> So in that case one makes a dummy Steam familyshare account for Cinders Or is it better to just not do online?
[3:22:55] <%Daniel_Is_I> Yeah and you probably won't get max reinforcement until soul of cinder
[3:22:57] <Shishi1205> Cheese more bosses
[3:22:58] <Admiral_PopnFresh> pvpMotivated

[3:28:41] <MayorRev> Is pat inside the gamer cube?
[3:28:42] <%CommanderSqueaks> It's like 90's Mike Tyson versus modern Mike Tyson.
[3:28:45] <+pectusumbra> I imagine it's the same vibe as bullying the hell out of mobs in terraria as well. Going back and roflstomping baby bosses
[3:28:46] <%SirGO0SE> it's like the Deep Sea King vs Mumen Rider
[3:28:50] <Darkmega97> only 10 more times
[3:28:57] <Shishi1205> What do you need?
[3:29:07] <Shishi1205> And do you know what bosses drop it?
[3:29:15] <Scrub_Seeker> @PatStaresAt you can get the next level of primordial titanite from the abyss watchers

[3:31:04] <Admiral_PopnFresh> Thanks Solaire
[3:31:06] <+regurgitatedmemes> the affliction curses are way easier and faster to get primordial titanite
[3:31:06] <%Daniel_Is_I> @PatStaresAt The curses are way easier. Curse of Pride boosts damage taken by 30% but gives you a 50% chance at a primordial piece
[3:31:06] <%starotter70> oh man

[3:31:42] <%Bluwizard21> @PatStaresAt There is an altar next to the skeleman that lets you inflict curses on yourself. These curses will give you percentage chances to get the primordial materials, they do not stack, but each curse has its own chance to get you a material.
[3:31:45] <+Invlux> Climax is beating the hell out of him

[3:43:12] <%walternatorz> ROBERTOOOOO
[3:43:16] <$galaxyswirl> with how busted magic seems, why would u ever wanna do a melee build in cinders???
[3:43:17] <FutaSnek> This area felt super empty
[3:43:18] <dinnydanny777> It would be wild if they put the monk guys from Sekiro inbthis
[3:43:23] <+ItsCaptainDisco> I'm very curious to see how they have changed Yhorm
[3:43:29] <+Quack_of_Dawn> Beware Pat's dark climax

[3:59:39] <@SoFarFetched> I like the cold,except when it makes my hot food cold fast.
[3:59:43] <+ItsCaptainDisco> But Pat, is Canada not the coldest place?
[3:59:45] <Captain_Aham> of course the Canadian says that
[3:59:46] <%IncredibleMeh> You know what also performs bad under heat? robots
[3:59:47] <%dekkitout> I'd settle for no less than 26 C
[3:59:48] <+mans51> yeah but two thirds of the year being super dark sucks too

[4:00:20] <%heartlesshealer> PAT ITEM
[4:00:20] <%SWFanatic> F Mimic
[4:00:21] <Scrub_Seeker> item
[4:00:21] <+Invlux> best used in open spaces

[4:00:32] <%Daniel_Is_I> I think my favorite ascended spell is Emit Force because it gets Farron Dart's cast animation

[4:00:34] <%R3Roundabout> MIMIC ITEM
[4:00:38] <PrinceOfEden> Yeah, I've always preferred colder weather over hot. When it's cold, you can put on as much as you need to stay warm. When it's hot, at a certain point your fucked and getting arrested for indecent exposure.

[4:05:56] <DXLelouch24> TLOU2
[4:05:57] <dinnydanny777> The Last of Us 2 could not be off to a worse start
[4:05:58] <%kyh9> @PrinceOfEden It's even funnier given that it's a tweet about Joel and Ellie continuing their adventure and it basically has nothing there. Strangely foreshadowing
[4:05:58] <+Invlux> SPEEN
[4:05:58] <+pectusumbra> I think the phrase here is "get fucked nerds"
[4:06:11] <%PaladinDupre> yes
[4:06:12] <Ipsenscastle> I can't believe Paige had so many viewers for her stream where she didn't know what she wanted to do the other night, it just dawned on me how weird that is
[4:06:14] <%heartlesshealer> soul greatsword is what someone was getting hype for

[4:06:55] <%LaughingCatt> neat
[4:07:00] <IntrepidEye> been here 10 minutes and somehow only just now noticed Elmo in the corner
[4:07:01] <%arcaderabbit48> That's literally the Greatsowrd model you're summoning. So at least the name is on point!
[4:07:01] <%kyh9> "Computer, get me the video of all the videos of Joel and Ellie, alive, going on adventures in TLOU2""No videos found"
[4:07:04] <%WheatlyXT> neat
[4:07:07] <+Invlux> Peggle... 3

[4:07:23] <%Shadicara> But number go down
[4:07:24] <huskarl_zap> PEGGLE 3 MFER
[4:07:26] <%optimasmaximas> pat embracing his inner uchiha going with the darkness instead
[4:07:28] <+Erimos> Why bother when you can just nuke things from orbit.
[4:07:31] <%xcompleasedad> AOE and less magic?
[4:07:35] <%heartlesshealer> You never equip it anymore
[4:07:44] <tolloponik> all of hi spells have aor though
[4:07:45] <+GodFluffyCuffs> holyshit. Is that cat alive?
[4:07:46] <Davimotion96> ok

[4:08:23] <%Wurmspawn> Ooooo
[4:08:25] <%SWFanatic> Destory the KKK
[4:08:26] <%xcompleasedad> @Wurmspawn Has to be shirtless to live
[4:08:27] <%alphonseisbest> where do all these spells come from? i don't remember seeing them in the base game
[4:08:33] <%Wurmspawn> I see.
[4:08:35] <%starotter70> @Wurmspawn Pat nip nip sweaty, so he needs to ice them up
[4:08:43] <sendart> also a dark miracle tome I believe
[4:08:47] <Valentinius_Anodyne> @alphonseisbest MMod adds a whole bunch of spells
[4:08:50] <Scrub_Seeker> @PatStaresAt you should let yhorm do some shit for a bit because cinders changes him and you're absolutely going to nuke him with dark magic
[4:09:04] <@Pandora_Prime> None can gaze upon the pale Patflesh and remain sane.
[4:09:07] <Melchior_the_Wise> so paige is tasked with icing the nips?
[4:09:10] <%DappercatEsquire> READ IT
[4:09:12] <dinnydanny777> She wouldn't go near a miracle huh
[4:09:12] <Shishi1205> Where is the profane one
[4:09:14] <%alphonseisbest> damn thats a good mod
[4:09:21] <+GodFluffyCuffs> @PatStaresAt I think Pat needs a head pat
[4:09:25] <Melchior_the_Wise> Icing Pats nips
[4:09:25] <%heartlesshealer> cluster bomb swarm??????
[4:09:31] <%dekkitout> Murder Bee Attack
[4:09:34] <%heartlesshealer> I'm sorry what
[4:09:35] <%WhereIsWill> I never wanted to know about pats greasy pepperoni nips gdi
[4:09:38] <dinnydanny777> Wait cluster bomb swarm?
[4:09:38] <DXLelouch24> @patstaresat Cinders gives Yorm new moves so let him do shit then nuke him
[4:09:46] <dinnydanny777> That sounds like a ridiculously good spell
[4:09:55] <%optimasmaximas> PogChamp
[4:09:59] <%heartlesshealer> it wasn't named that, but the description gave off an intense cluster bomb feel
[4:10:00] <+Erimos> Earthbender build
[4:10:02] <Shishi1205> Meteor time
[4:10:02] <Valentinius_Anodyne> Boulder Heave 2 baby
[4:10:04] <Shishi1205> ?
[4:10:06] <%JusTTheGuyYouNeed> earthfall is cool
[4:10:10] <Scrub_Seeker> the earth pyromancies are pretty sick but not for your build
[4:10:15] <%dekkitout> Da powa WITHIN! YEAH!
[4:10:16] <DXLelouch24> Meteor
[4:10:20] <@Pandora_Prime> Bouldaga
[4:10:22] <Scrub_Seeker> ironflesh
[4:10:22] <%Agami23> the statues
[4:10:23] <DXLelouch24> We Sephiroth now
[4:10:24] <%SWFanatic> The Last Airbender
[4:10:26] <%Ynkubus18> Lava
[4:10:29] <+sashagreenspiderqueen> demons
[4:10:29] <%dekkitout> Cause rocks are just frozen lava
[4:10:30] <%LaughingCatt> magma maybe?
[4:10:30] <%Agami23> the giant stone demons
[4:10:31] <Grandma_Amari> I guess because Pyromancers are basically shamans
[4:10:32] <%JusTTheGuyYouNeed> lava and stuff
[4:10:32] <Captain_Aham> petrified stuff
[4:10:32] <tolloponik> why is lava associated with fire
[4:10:34] <+Erimos> Time is convoluted in Lothric
[4:10:34] <dinnydanny777> Pyromancy has poison spells too
[4:10:35] <$lotharrio> Pyromancy is shitty, primoridial magic.
[4:10:36] <%arcaderabbit48> @PatStaresAt Because the demons were originally stone statues imbued with life by the rampant Bed of Chaos
[4:10:39] <%Fooguwu> pyromancy is earthy, swampy
[4:10:52] <%heartlesshealer> Igneous rock is just magma + water
[4:10:53] <@Pandora_Prime> Much like Pat is right now.
[4:10:55] <ammobasket> ash part of ash and flame
[4:10:56] <%SWFanatic> Yang was like WEE and earthified fire
[4:10:57] <%ElkRiverDog> Lava?
[4:11:03] <%Mr_Pylon> oh cool
[4:11:05] <%heartlesshealer> oh wow, good lore
[4:11:07] <%CommanderSqueaks> Wait, stone or wood?
[4:11:08] <chronoxgp> No
[4:11:09] <%dekkitout> Great lore
[4:11:09] <dinnydanny777> So why the poison spells?
[4:11:13] <+Shacklebox> yeah that's why they're all rocky and crumbly
[4:11:14] <PrinceOfEden> YEET
[4:11:14] <%CommanderSqueaks> I thought it was wood?
[4:11:17] <Shishi1205> Snipe the back
[4:11:18] <koolaid_kevster> they were stoned?
[4:11:20] <%DappercatEsquire> GET SNIPED
[4:11:20] <%arcaderabbit48> @PatStaresAt So, demons are fading, life is leaving them, and they're returning to stone. Hence that one demon that just vomits rocks at you
[4:11:21] <chronoxgp> there are human bodies incased in the stone
[4:11:22] <worldbrand> because swamp
[4:11:25] <%CommanderSqueaks> Oh okay
[4:11:25] <%Daniel_Is_I> Sniper brazier
[4:11:25] <Shishi1205> Use climax
[4:11:27] <%CommanderSqueaks> Neato
[4:11:28] <%SWFanatic> Death to the KKK
[4:11:30] <Grandma_Amari> Wait they were? I thought demons were mutated dwellers of Izalith
[4:11:32] <%SWFanatic> Death to the Holy Grail
[4:11:41] <Scrub_Seeker> it is them casting it
[4:11:43] <%heartlesshealer> yeah, flame alive
[4:11:51] <%CommanderSqueaks> The flame is doing its best
[4:11:52] <%heartlesshealer> they just feed flame
[4:11:52] <Scrub_Seeker> they're just using the the pyre TO cast it
[4:11:55] <dinnydanny777> Flame On
[4:11:57] <chronoxgp> gargoyles only come out at night
[4:11:59] <%optimasmaximas> they use their weird sticks pat
[4:12:01] <%xcompleasedad> FROM the pyre
[4:12:03] <+Lost_Zombie> nah that's the profane flame doing it
[4:12:05] <%arcaderabbit48> @PatStaresAt They cast the magic through their giant cauldron of flame
[4:12:06] <srkAres> they channel into the flame iirc
[4:12:10] <CappuccinoGuil> They are casting it and it pops from the bowl
[4:12:11] <nobknee> Pat looks handsome today.
[4:12:14] <%BubbaRands> Fire bad. Fire alive
[4:12:15] <$Dakuu75> that was a pro dodge-roll. stuck in place. used those i-frames
[4:12:16] <%TrollKing96> Aren't some of the demons all tree-like though?
[4:12:20] <%heartlesshealer> flame alive
[4:12:23] <Scrub_Seeker> there's one alive behind it though
[4:12:27] <%Shadicara> LUL
[4:12:34] <%heartlesshealer> ah, rule of four?
[4:12:35] <%SWFanatic> you have to hit them woolie
[4:12:42] <chronoxgp> when saints die they return to myrh trees, demons are from bed of chaos
[4:12:47] <%Valdorick> bruh
[4:12:54] <%DappercatEsquire> total bruh moment when the sniper brazier won't quit
[4:12:57] <srkAres> @TrollKing96 the arch trees were stone too, if im not mistaken
[4:12:59] <%Audega> Audega subscribed at Tier 1. They've subscribed for 2 months! Hey Pat, been a fan ever since the old DS1 machinima video with Matt. That video got me to check out Dark Souls 1, as I had never heard of it before then, and it's been my favorite game for almost a decade now. Be safe, be healthy, a fine dark soul to you
[4:12:59] <+NitronStreams> but what does the hat do in trickster?
[4:13:01] <ssks123> my BRAND!

[4:13:29] <%BubbaRands> WutFace
[4:13:29] <%heartlesshealer> lots of progress
[4:13:33] <%Shadicara> Whole game is pat throwing his dark nut at his foes
[4:13:33] <%WhereIsWill> yeyeye
[4:13:36] <PrinceOfEden> That feeling when the next step you take is a little lower than normal. That mild but short heart attack.
[4:13:40] <%arcaderabbit48> Trees ARE kinda evil in Dark Souls, aren't they?
[4:13:42] <Shishi1205> Fuck aldrich and sulivan
[4:13:43] <42nfl19> @patstaresat does smacking the chest ruin the items? If not, why not just smack all the chests?
[4:13:44] <$Dakuu75> doodOne doodOne doodNo doodOne
[4:13:54] <%DappercatEsquire> @pectusumbra How does Darkest Dungeon PvP work? Party vs party or does someone control monsters?
[4:13:54] <%heartlesshealer> Is flame still up?
[4:14:03] <%Valdorick> Yeah, but are you going to BEAT him, or puss out and stormruler?
[4:14:09] <+sashagreenspiderqueen> party v party
[4:14:12] <+pectusumbra> party vs party is the plan but we don't know more than that
[4:14:13] <tolloponik> can pat beat yorm without the storm ruler?
[4:14:14] <%SWFanatic> For real?
[4:14:16] <Shishi1205> Dex
[4:14:21] <%heartlesshealer> nowhere
[4:14:21] <ssks123> it isnt?
[4:14:22] <+chaggles> linked to dex
[4:14:30] <Shishi1205> Time to level Dex for fall speed and cast time
[4:14:30] <Scrub_Seeker> @Valdorick the stormruler isn't as good in vanilla as it is in cinders
[4:14:31] <+Kataiser> Dex + whatever number your gear gives
[4:14:33] <%DappercatEsquire> Sounds like a cool addition, I just wish DD didn't stress me out so much
[4:14:35] <CureMode666> DEX
[4:14:35] <%Ynkubus18> Haha, sword go wooosh
[4:14:37] <%SvenHolgersson> @PatStaresAt Sorry if you've been asked this before but is Paige planning to play DS3 after finishing 2?
[4:14:38] <Scrub_Seeker> it doesn't stagger and it does normal damage
[4:14:43] <chronoxgp> tower knight coming up
[4:14:47] <%heartlesshealer> linked to dex, but has hard numbers applied to it since the Hexer set affects it directly
[4:14:47] <rafaelba93> it isnt i think
[4:14:59] <%arcaderabbit48> Why are these crystal lizaRDS SPLOOSHING ALL OVER THE PLACE??
[4:15:00] <Davimotion96> F
[4:15:00] <%SWFanatic> good catch
[4:15:02] <%heartlesshealer> secret stat

[4:15:40] <%heartlesshealer> ???
[4:15:41] <SaltyAzteca> Pat was always a charmer Kappa
[4:15:42] <dinnydanny777> That was a crystal lizard
[4:15:46] <%king_wragles> I don't know what I just say, but it looked incredibly violent
[4:15:49] <Shishi1205> Fascinating
[4:15:51] <%king_wragles> *saw
[4:15:59] <Personified134> did Pat get the dark staff in the poison pit of this zone
[4:16:03] <Grandma_Amari> Abyssal is probably better single target for enemies not easy to stunlock
[4:16:05] <%Daniel_Is_I> @PatStaresAt Just wait until you ascend and Abyssal Edge starts pancaking people
[4:16:08] <%BubbaRands> Swept them off their feat. Pats a real charmer psaSmug
[4:16:10] <rafaelba93> still the cooler
[4:16:11] <%Ascethetic> @personified134 yes
[4:16:11] <+Kataiser> I like how flashswords are viable at endgame now. They're really fun.
[4:16:14] <Personified134> kk
[4:16:18] <%king_wragles> Ya, abyssal just looked like a stun
[4:16:18] <%heartlesshealer> this rotting treasure room always weirds out my vision
[4:16:20] <Valentinius_Anodyne> Abyssal is big Anti-Poise
[4:16:23] <%DappercatEsquire> sweet hand baby
[4:16:27] <DXLelouch24> Abyssal Edge ascended has ungodly poise
[4:16:27] <%AncelDeLambert> Sony just DMCA'd their own The Last of Us 2 trailer on twitter, folks. This is it, this is peak corporate panic
[4:16:37] <%arcaderabbit48> Oh christ, these things. Why are they hand thingies??

[4:17:26] <Shishi1205> COUNTER
[4:17:26] <+pectusumbra> just hit him
[4:17:27] <PrinceOfEden> This dude is WOKE
[4:17:27] <%Mr_Pylon> Go gargoyle!
[4:17:27] <ssks123> why is it invincible in the air
[4:17:31] <%SWFanatic> zig instead of zagging
[4:17:32] <AlphaTauri> is he not using Climax
[4:17:33] <+FoolsArcade> Is it bad I still want to play Last of Us 2 despite the bullshit going on?
[4:17:34] <Scrub_Seeker> these guys are bullshit, their hitbox vanishes when they fly
[4:17:35] <+sashagreenspiderqueen> that works
[4:17:36] <@SoFarFetched> Not even WE can look at it
[4:17:37] <%heartlesshealer> maybe climax
[4:17:39] <%Valdorick> He's not getting the cast off - he's getting staggered
[4:17:45] <%SWFanatic> YHORM
[4:17:56] <Davimotion96> "be honest, if you didn't have that i would've won"
[4:17:56] <Shishi1205> Mimics
[4:18:00] <%DappercatEsquire> @FoolsArcade nah, I think the spoiler shit is premature, I want to see the execution
[4:18:03] <heybenice> Is there drama or something surrounding last of us 2?
[4:18:05] <tolloponik> let this be a lesson to never let a Japanese company get owned by an american in California
[4:18:12] <Grandma_Amari> @FoolsArcade Nah, it's probably going to play well, the first game did. It's just a shame the story is looking to be total garbage when it didn't need to be.
[4:18:16] <+GodFluffyCuffs> Id tell sony to suck a dick. but they probably enjoy cock
[4:18:24] <Shishi1205> yhorm gear?

[4:19:03] <%SWFanatic> I did some Hat enlargening offscreen
[4:19:09] <+NitronStreams> But what does the hat do in swordmaster?
[4:19:10] <Scrub_Seeker> @PatStaresAt you dont need storm ruler
[4:19:12] <POCKETSANDX> Am i dumb or did they move the "past broadcasts? tab around??
[4:19:15] <%arcaderabbit48> Apparentlyy Pat stumboed his way into one of Cinders' most overpowered builds. Turns out magic is pretty sick when it actually works properly!
[4:19:15] <%Daniel_Is_I> Wait until you see how they improved Yhorm
