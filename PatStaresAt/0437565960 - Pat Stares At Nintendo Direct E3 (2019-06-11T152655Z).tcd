[1:28:40] <Jolnir> pats an incel
[1:28:41] <Will_The_Soulless> I guess the fun is the building up your town

[1:28:43] <Nupinoop296> brownBACKSEAT brownBACKSEAT brownBACKSEAT
[1:28:45] <%zetoe> Animal crossing isn't just about decorating your house holy crap. It's kind of about collecting in general.
[1:28:45] <Twoiis> Rune Factory is a lot of fun.
[1:28:46] <$RaikenTB> At least Animal Crossing showed gameplay LUL
[1:28:46] <KnightofNights2> amazing

[1:29:06] <+sanguis3k> BotW was overrated
[1:29:06] <Will_The_Soulless> Like the whole reason I like the game is the starting from nothing
[1:29:08] <+ShikiHisashi> Good luck you awesome goblin XD

[1:29:26] <aero160h> Hey Pat, remember when Final Fantasy Tactics died, as well as shining force? Well at least we have waifu simulator (Fire Emblem).
[1:29:27] <$Big_King_Coconut> hey pat you smell
[1:29:27] <jiisuri> I guess Animal Crossing's appeal is similar to the feel of just collecting stuff?
[1:29:27] <%Mtome> Where's Vergil?
[1:29:27] <Fujiwara_92> it's just a chill game dude
[1:29:27] <+Pookiedaexzile> Replace the MMo monsters with plants and relationships
[1:29:28] <@commanderclaw> Not everyone can afford a nice house
[1:29:28] <BettyMwwaahh> You dont get it because you dont like happiness
[1:29:28] <%Edgy_Macaroon> Why wouldnt they scream at you in front of everybody
[1:29:28] <+ChestMimik> Animal Crossing is a Zen Garden
[1:29:28] <magmameow> it makes you happy
[1:29:29] <Karakuioshi> The same thing as Stardew Valey
[1:29:29] <$vincerocmm> no you just said the deal
[1:29:29] <%Agami23> @AngriestPat because that worked so well with the gacha thing right???
[1:29:29] <+butch_deadlift> its like having friends and a successful life
[1:29:30] <+Pookiedaexzile> You lizard

[1:29:33] <%doggettxalex> it's relaxing
[1:29:33] <leargo> this keeps on going, fascinating
[1:29:33] <scrumbotime> It's like a zen garden
[1:29:33] <Basch71> Animal Crossing is just crafting jobs but with no actual progress
[1:29:33] <%ElenaManetta> No challenge, no death, no worries
[1:29:34] <+gerenago> Doom is relaxing
[1:29:34] <Will_The_Soulless> building up from nothing creating your own home that you like
[1:29:34] <%Radregice_> guys pat doesn't play video games to have fun
[1:29:34] <Djinnazz> so masturbating.
[1:29:34] <martmartez> plus that disgusting "game" persona is taking resources
[1:29:34] <nyacoo> Animal Crossing is love, Animal Crossing is life
[1:29:34] <+Th3SmartAlec> ITs chill time waster
[1:29:35] <gigacanuck> the amount they charge you for your house makes it the quintessential millenial experience
[1:29:35] <$cureneckbeard> Pat you can fish and also catch bugs and cry when your villagers move out
[1:29:36] <+miguelrod777> it means fuck you
[1:29:36] <%Solidnick18> it is
[1:29:37] <+PlaneWalkerDavid> It's like grinding in an MMO Pat
[1:29:37] <Picia000123> Going through the motions is relaxing for some
[1:29:37] <indig0bird> Just put on a podcast and do cute shit with animls
[1:29:38] <moogleboy1984> it's video game ASMR
[1:29:38] <%korth367> how do u feel when playing hat in time
[1:29:38] <+HyperCharge_Sam> It's both
[1:29:38] <lokiluko> it's just a fuzzy skinner box, not a hard concept
[1:29:39] <unlimited_osteopath> it means it's relaxing, the fuck you think
[1:29:39] <artoflec> Why do you grind in your Warframe garbage its relaxing
[1:29:39] <%spiritofmojave> just that really
[1:29:39] <$HeroToxiko> it's a non violent game for artist types basically
[1:29:40] <%Daniel_Is_I> Well when you're not hopped up on red bull you can relax.
[1:29:40] <masso101> There is no deal people like doing mindless inane activities for nothing
[1:29:41] <fugnuggets01> Same reason why people play mobile games but without microtransactions
[1:29:41] <DemonofSkulls> Animal crossing is a happy place
[1:29:41] <+Raspada_Ryner> Why do you like MMOs?
[1:29:41] <Picabunny> "what does it mean to relax"
[1:29:42] <$Kingdomgene> Pat, it's like Minecraft but different way to waste time
[1:29:42] <%Wallabri> pat doesn't know how to relax
[1:29:42] <%theo_marks> its really just a cihll relaxing game where you can talk to some animals and make em happy with a fruit
[1:29:42] <+Spag313> pat doesn't understand what it means to be relaxed
[1:29:42] <@commanderclaw> Like grinding in FFXIV
[1:29:43] <Nina96> u just cant relax pat
[1:29:43] <Karakuioshi> SAME
[1:29:43] <%sshen> C O M F Y
[1:29:43] <Geassmaster5> Literally a waste of time like MMOs
[1:29:44] <twoto858> It's like watering a garden
[1:29:44] <Onmi_Khaos> Pay
[1:29:44] <%BeatH7> Yo but real question, where the fuck is VERGIL?
[1:29:45] <Onmi_Khaos> Pat
[1:29:46] <%Konquerer> what is this "relaxing" you humans speak of
[1:29:46] <Fujiwara_92> it's like a zenph garden
[1:29:46] <%DoomedCanary> Animal Crossing is a game about putting toilets in your living room next to your sword collection.
[1:29:46] <%ECRead> what do you mean what do we mean
[1:29:47] <Bamith20> I know all that Red Bull makes you impossible, but come on, its simple.
[1:29:47] <AmericanaRed> Chat is 12 year olds
[1:29:47] <%ValidVenasaur> Its a videogame
[1:29:47] <indig0bird> Lol yeah, it's ASMR
[1:29:48] <TheIncoherentGamer> It means that you dont like it but we like it
[1:29:48] <Silentpriced> it just chill and a very comfortable play
[1:29:48] <srkAres> the soms is just an rpg. you max stats.
[1:29:49] <%Solidnick18> it's a life waster
[1:29:49] <abakkus> i have a lot of nostalgia for it too
[1:29:49] <%HentaiSenpai9K> NotLikeThis
[1:29:49] <RinWR> It's ok to not understand
[1:29:49] <+Ell1ot> animal crossing is fetch quests and money grinding
[1:29:50] <iggynodiggy> all video games are time waters
[1:29:50] <calamitan> you can live a good and fulfilling version of your shitty life instead of the real thing
[1:29:50] <$ZE_Count> Thats because you have a dity heart full of sin pat!
[1:29:50] <BrOOnoh> i dont play games to waste time LUL
[1:29:50] <KingKZ> They are games about peace and serenity.
[1:29:50] <%crimsonharvest> The sims is even less of a game
[1:29:50] <%ElenaManetta> The Sims you can actually fucking die, at least that has some ounce of challenge.
[1:29:50] <+Ablestron> Man I know that dragon quest is popular but boy that art style doesnt appeal to me at all
[1:29:50] <Neo_Kaiser> konami is planning a special annuncement tomorrow!
[1:29:51] <%Shady_Squid> It's just a comfy game.
[1:29:51] <%zetoe> You know when you get a piece of gear that's 10 item levels higher? that's the whole gameplay loop of animal crossing
[1:29:51] <Titaaaannss> You get to see progress without stressing too much
[1:29:52] <Onmi_Khaos> Just turn your brain off
[1:29:52] <indig0bird> I do both lol
[1:29:52] <+DevCrom3> It's Monster Hunter without monsters
[1:29:53] <laguerrilha> Take less effort
[1:29:53] <tag545> busy work so you forget your inevitable doom
[1:29:54] <iggynodiggy> wasters even
[1:29:54] <bettysharkface> Catch fish, talk to cute animals, make your house nice.
[1:29:55] <srkAres> BECAUSE MONEY
[1:29:55] <kc703> lol true
[1:29:55] <+AlwaysBeGaming> order your house
[1:29:56] <+brakkathoom> ordering?
[1:29:56] <$FlubbedPig> You play it to relax, like Iyashikei anime
[1:29:56] <%doggettxalex> Some of us already ordered our house
[1:29:56] <gigacanuck> chat has shit taste
[1:29:57] <reonome> because I don't have money pat
[1:29:57] <+Eddy21forsaken> MONEY
[1:29:58] <+Hotironclad> No stakes in a story, no stress, cute art and world.
[1:29:58] <+PlaneWalkerDavid> Because ordering your house and gardening takes physical labor
[1:29:58] <+Rare_Ruiz> Pat has never relaxed a day in his life.
[1:29:58] <%Cavumentum> Comfort game
[1:29:58] <indig0bird> I hate gardening tho
[1:29:59] <FrostyBlizzard> Its far less effort and money
[1:29:59] <+Ell1ot> i garden in my garden
[1:29:59] <%FancyHatMan> cause im young and cant do these things PAAT
[1:29:59] <Bamith20> I fucking hate dirt
[1:30:00] <Nupinoop296> i can do both
[1:30:00] <Karakuioshi> True!
[1:30:00] <%theo_marks> instant gratification?
[1:30:00] <jiisuri> It's like that except it's a vidya
[1:30:00] <%HentaiSenpai9K> Because life sucks
[1:30:01] <$Gehtingsberg> It’s a 2nd life
[1:30:01] <$vincerocmm> you dont have the baby brain
[1:30:01] <%crimsonharvest> Because I don't own any property of any kind
[1:30:01] <MegafunkSA> Why don't you just animal crossing irl 4Head
[1:30:01] <%nocreditclear> I've only enjoyed AC-type games as something to play while listening to a podcast or whatever.
[1:30:01] <marklarphd> real life is sad
[1:30:02] <Lutre> BOOMER TAKE
[1:30:02] <chad_irl> it's fun for furries
[1:30:02] <%Gogogolem> @AngriestPat It lets Millinials live out the such high fantasy as Owning a house, and paying of debt.
[1:30:02] <%Solidnick18> it's a life waster @AngriestPat
[1:30:03] <%Keyd00d> because I'm too lazy to do that
[1:30:03] <%bunnyyumi> MONEY
[1:30:03] <martmartez> @angriestpat explain ungeraged dating sim called persona
[1:30:03] <%doggettxalex> "ordering your house"
[1:30:03] <+thackattack00> Why not do literally anything besides purposely wasting your own time @AngriestPat
[1:30:03] <+Eclipse_knight_> @angriestpat being in control is relaxing
[1:30:03] <+HunterInABox> Because in real life I can't have a shark aquarium
[1:30:04] <%greatbalwaagh> LUL ye
[1:30:04] <%CJett92> pat, you play mmos. Why do you play them?
[1:30:04] <masso101> Yknow what game is relaxing? Yakuza. That game actually has shit in it too.
[1:30:04] <%allouttajuice> @AngriestPat Some people want to just do some mindless shit that doesn't require thought and it relaxes them. It's cute and aesthetically appealing so its more fun than house work for them
[1:30:04] <Saltmeisterr> cuz that cost real money
[1:30:04] <calamitan> it's easier
[1:30:05] <%mistersups> It's a Dollhouse game. Do you like to play with your Dolls in your Dollhouse?
[1:30:05] <Psyramics> that shits actual work
[1:30:05] <BalloniWright> cuz Nerds
[1:30:05] <Intolerable> RELAX
[1:30:06] <%DXLelouch24> because that takes time and money
[1:30:06] <$cureneckbeard> I don't have a house or garden or friends
[1:30:06] <Onmi_Khaos> and feeling icky
[1:30:06] <Xelhesia> rpgs are also relaxing but there's meaning in the game
[1:30:06] <TurtlesAndTentacles> it relaxes them you ginger
[1:30:07] <+king_of_beggars> It's zen. Like keeping a peace lily.
[1:30:07] <%ECRead> less effort and money
[1:30:07] <Fujiwara_92> because
[1:30:08] <natalieobrien> Don't all have gardens, Pat.
[1:30:09] <+brakkathoom> No back uo, ordering?
[1:30:09] <StripedBlackTie> Let pat play games in the way he wants to play jesus christ
[1:30:09] <%nikoloas_> beacuse the video game version isn't as stressful
[1:30:10] <dagreenpillow> cuz irl gardening and buying furniture is hard Pat
[1:30:10] <fugnuggets01> Think farm simulator
[1:30:11] <TheBlankAce> You don't have to understand it, people like different things
[1:30:11] <xmetalicdemonx> we cant use our lets play money to buy a house PAT.
[1:30:12] <lautalocos> because i know i will never afford a real house
[1:30:13] <%heckyell> why do you buy fake space money for ninja hats? because it's fun.
[1:30:13] <zepelinnn> why dont you just grind tomes IRL pat?
[1:30:13] <%Edgy_Macaroon> lazy that's why
[1:30:14] <%JackMillerTime> im broke cant garden and dont have a beach within walking distance
[1:30:14] <+AlwaysBeGaming> LUL
[1:30:14] <Lutre> I would if I had a home, BOOMER
[1:30:15] <+Answer_Moose> It's the instant gratification from it @AngriestPat
[1:30:16] <bsmusic> That sounds boring
[1:30:17] <damienlunas> You make money and number go up
[1:30:17] <$FlubbedPig> Because those are tiring and dirty. Animal Crossing has no liquids
[1:30:17] <+El_joeker> Pat is RIGHT
[1:30:18] <abakkus> its the millenial fnatasy of owning a home and not having depression in video game form
[1:30:18] <%Radregice_> LUL
[1:30:19] <$HeroToxiko> It
[1:30:19] <Shwepie> You know when you were a kid and you liked to dig in the dirt just because? It's that but in video game form.
[1:30:19] <OtakuBrawler> Pat its for the people that like to do that and dont get dirty
[1:30:19] <PerrinIsDead> Thats a good point
[1:30:19] <Contardation> we dont all make that twitch money lol
[1:30:20] <%AnIcedCoffee> i miss the farming in monster hunter
[1:30:20] <Ocaz> why do u order a game about killing people when u could just do that
[1:30:21] <%spiritofmojave> LUL
[1:30:21] <+DevCrom3> That's why I said it
[1:30:22] <%ElenaManetta> It's number go up, but the number go up is your life stats.
[1:30:22] <moogleboy1984> It's for the same set of people who prefer to decorate houses in XIV, or glamour whores
[1:30:25] <+griffball13> it's the same reason people play minecraft
[1:30:25] <Tennochief> Pat is dumb
[1:30:25] <%AkronymCLT> It's the Fantasy of being able pay off your debt Pat
[1:30:26] <+sendaigrolo> it's ff14 without the combat
[1:30:26] <Jontman42> sims has emergent story telling, and I can't build a house IRL
[1:30:26] <$Kingdomgene> cheer100 Pat, it's cause we're too lazy to do those things for real
[1:30:27] <%KENTASHIRO> Pat don't you buy virtual houses in XIV?
[1:30:27] <$HeroToxiko> It's facts tho
[1:30:28] <srkAres> your debt is the monster in animal crossing
[1:30:29] <Bamith20> Just go play Stardew Valley ya grimey bastard
[1:30:31] <Will_The_Soulless> its kinda why minecraft is so popular
[1:30:31] <kc703> Give em the truth Great Red Beard
[1:30:32] <%crimsonharvest> ANyway the point of Stardew specifically is to get FUCKIN RICH
[1:30:33] <+EdgeSetter> moon2PEEPEEGA why dp you watch people play games, just play them yourself
[1:30:33] <%nocreditclear> Low-effort games for multitasking
[1:30:33] <Picia000123> the same reason people play farm simulator
[1:30:33] <%Solidnick18> save it for the podcast
[1:30:33] <shiny_prinny> instead of grinding for stats/abilities you grind for a better house I guess?
[1:30:34] <$Big_King_Coconut> Monster Hunter has stuff besides monster hunting?
[1:30:34] <AmericanaRed> Damn chat is dumb
[1:30:35] <Geassmaster5> @lutre you can come and clean my house
[1:30:35] <%greatbalwaagh> apatWrong bad take dude
[1:30:36] <+Pookiedaexzile> Its the millennial Fantasy of Owning a home
[1:30:36] <FrithnanthH> @AngriestPat Why grind in FF14?
[1:30:36] <leargo> cause gardening gives me anxiety
[1:30:39] <+BorinCorran> Pat, I feel like you're too high strung and anxious to play AC, it's why I can't. Am I a bitch about it? Nah.
[1:30:39] <%Alaster101> i get no gratification in my real life pat
[1:30:41] <%sshen> Debt number go up Pat
[1:30:42] <%zetoe> Animal crossing is about small achievements. Every time you bump your item level in ffxiv is the whole gameplay loop of animal crossing.
[1:30:43] <Picia000123> It's just fun Pat
[1:30:43] <FkCritter> AC is terraria without the combat
[1:30:44] <+MisterRockett> You know how you get your Free Company house looking all good a nice? Some people want a game of just that.
[1:30:45] <jiisuri> part of the appeal is just cute animals too
[1:30:46] <+Hotironclad> It's just not for you @AngriestPat
[1:30:46] <$HeroToxiko> @Pookiedaexzile too real
[1:30:46] <+Raspada_Ryner> Don't you like making your Warframe look nice? It's almost the same thing I think
[1:30:48] <+juvahas> @angriestpat you get the satisfaction of doing a bunch of chores n seeing everything nice and neat, but without the actual work - that’s animal crossing
[1:30:49] <%danpc5> Tom Sekiro

[1:31:28] <+GalaxyFlow> i mean you could let people enjoy what they want
[1:31:28] <mamabedlam> As far as I can tell, Animal Crossing is played by people who want to feel productive but for some reason they just aren't. I dunno, kinda feels like a debt sim to me.
[1:31:28] <+Th3SmartAlec> What about Paige
[1:31:28] <%Aeogard> well, YOU can't
[1:31:29] <$Big_King_Coconut> everyone is a big monster compared to pat

[1:31:43] <%Agami23> @AngriestPat you summed it up right away, animal crossing is a phone game on consoles.

[1:31:46] <$FlubbedPig> Not everyone's got enough money to have a house in real life... or friends
[1:31:46] <Calek> too bad the quest design of ff14 sucks booty and makes playing through the story unenjoyable
[1:31:47] <Bamith20> I can't know because playing the game sucks lol
[1:31:47] <ImmaCanuck> haHAA
[1:31:47] <kc703> or woolie
[1:31:47] <moogleboy1984> Except for Stormbringers

[1:31:49] <%FancyHatMan> HEAVENSWARD IS FANTASTIC
[1:31:49] <+Pookiedaexzile> Uh huh
[1:31:50] <indig0bird> ARR is pretty tedious but Heavensward is fantastic
[1:31:50] <%mistersups> In Animal Crossing you can pay off your Dept. You can't do that in real life. kappa
[1:31:50] <Basch71> FFXIV is an actual FF game LuL

[1:31:53] <copyritetm> lol i played ff14 and the story is total garbo
[1:31:54] <+miguelrod777> NOT BEFORE
[1:31:54] <%HentaiSenpai9K> In Animal Crossing I can catch fish without leaving the house
[1:31:54] <+dybia> The problem is getting to that story through the base game.
[1:31:54] <%Daniel_Is_I> Man who doesn't know laughs at people who don't know
[1:31:54] <GenericTwitchAcc1> sure Kappa
[1:31:54] <artoflec> You don't KNOW BabyRage
[1:31:54] <%BestTeaMaker> @AngriestPat i would love to see that story if it wasn't gated by a terrible beginning
[1:31:55] <Swimmingrock> @AngriestPat I genuinely want to play FF14 for the story, but hate MMO mechanics :(
[1:31:56] <+TheBigO75> who cares dude
[1:31:56] <Xelhesia> its literally top 5 FF Stories
[1:31:56] <masso101> You know what you also can’t do in real life that you can do in ac? Make friends gottem
[1:31:57] <%Shady_Squid> but pat, i've been skipping all the cutscenes because they take too long
[1:31:57] <immortan_joel> Not when grinding
[1:31:57] <%marsano168> FF14 has the BEST FF story in years!
[1:31:58] <+King_JaXon> Sorry PAt, won't let me resubscribe until the 17th :/ but I don't know who I'm subscribed to instead :/
[1:31:58] <%Edgy_Macaroon> animals are big monsters

[1:32:01] <transporterthesequel> Top 3 Final Fantasy EASY
[1:32:01] <+ckangaroo15k> Nah it's trash Kappa
[1:32:01] <%Laevigata> In real life your neighbors suck and you're anti-social, not nearly as true in Animal Crossing.
[1:32:02] <%spiritofmojave> FF14 has way more a story than person in furry town in AC
[1:32:02] <Fuji_Apples> YOU KNOW NOTHING JON
[1:32:02] <indig0bird> Estinien is such a trip lol
[1:32:02] <@SSaryn> It's literally people getting mad over an MMO being popular it feels like.
[1:32:02] <%allouttajuice> @AngriestPat the story in 14 is ok, above the grade for an mmo but I wouldn't call it legitimately fantastic. It's probably the best modern ff game though lol
[1:32:03] <%BlueBardTiefling> The end of A Realm Reborn onwards is freaking great
[1:32:03] <calamitan> HW > everything else is shit
[1:32:04] <lokiluko> it has an interesting story, you used the word riveting earlier, and it most certainly is not

[1:32:13] <Zaphire_Saucypants> Todd Coward's Mii for Smash.
[1:32:14] <+Eddy21forsaken> any story is bad story for animal crossing people that's why the game has no story
[1:32:14] <%ElenaManetta> Facebook?
[1:32:14] <TalisKanju> Most Final Fantasy stories are terrible, that's not saying much
[1:32:15] <BalloniWright> Rune Factory has farming, but also story and Battles
[1:32:15] <%Keyd00d> Not at all
[1:32:17] <+Ablestron> FF14's story reminds me a lot of Legend of the Galactic heroes. Lots of Characters, all well written and executed. Everything is executed very economically.

[1:32:21] <Bamith20> Cause I hated playing FF14 so damn much for the 3 hours I played lol
[1:32:21] <%crimsonharvest> it's suspicious that you praise the story in FF14, it's so glacial and uninteresting that I'm not sure you've ever seen any fiction before.
[1:32:21] <Storm_Samurai> He’s right it is quite good
[1:32:21] <%Solidnick18> it's something

[1:32:33] <+arfsm95> @AngriestPat it's a phone game, i have it in my phone right now
[1:32:35] <Klefth> This is how I felt with FF11. the story in that game was better than a few main line games, but people just dismissed it because "lel MMO". Fuck, man...

[1:36:24] <$Gehtingsberg> So what’s different about us saying “you don’t know.” about animal crossing? It’s just a nice, calming game for a lot of young people who find life hard and need something to relax them. Not everyone has a garden, the house or apartment doesn’t need cleaning all the time, and it’s a video game. So people who like playing games, but don’t want anything violent or high octane can play animal crossing and walk around a town with cute animal people.

[1:38:33] <etnoika> I mean, if I want to walk around relaxing in a virtual world I would rather do that in an actual fantasy world. I can literally do everything you can do in AC in World of Warcraft and if I feel like it I can also jump into a raid or PvP when I feel like it.
[1:38:33] <%CJett92> no one said that tho
[1:38:33] <+ShikiHisashi> You can think about fucking these specific animal ppl though. XD Or Abigail from Stardew
[1:38:34] <elaboratebagel> I think its the same as sports games where they like doing the thing without the negatives of actually doing it like getting physically exhausting and stuff
[1:38:34] <UsrgDemon> Pat I think that's just your schizophrenia.
[1:38:36] <%FancyHatMan> but i don't wWANNA go outsideee

[1:38:40] <%25RPM> no one likes you animal crossing people go back to your basements.
[1:38:40] <%ElenaManetta> But Hat in Time is challenging
[1:38:41] <$HeroToxiko> Those Games End tho
[1:38:42] <+lebuusch> what are you trying to say with that?
[1:38:43] <raven_frame> Was Pat happy or disappointed with Nintendo?
[1:38:43] <+JingKaisean> Montréal? you can find animals there?
[1:38:43] <GenericTwitchAcc1> DO IT
[1:38:43] <%cirdrag> the appeal is that they can actually own a house in the game xD
[1:38:44] <Intolerable> NOBODY SAID THAT
[1:38:46] <$SGrim> @AngriestPat social anxiety is probably the counter-argument to that.
[1:38:47] <+AlwaysBeGaming> it's easier to level up in a game than it is in life
[1:38:47] <+Sheepwalk> Sorry Pat I like Animal Crossing and you cant change that
[1:38:48] <CptBritches> They aren't implying that all other video games are high octane, they are implying that Animal Crossing isn't you idiot
[1:38:49] <damienlunas> Remember the time when Ylisse was like "No we can't execute war criminals because of the slippery slope fallacy"
[1:38:51] <Wannabe_Reviewer> Is Pat of all people with his dumb bullshit broken brain really trying to tell people why they are wrong for enjoying something?

[1:38:59] <gigacanuck> @ChineseNininga you can, you're just not brave enough to try
[1:38:59] <savontee> People like some things “wooly”

[1:39:04] <%marcymallow> I mean, the simplest answer is just that it's not for you, Pat. :p That's all. If you don't understand it, that's fine!

[1:39:05] <%Spiders4Brekfast> PECK YOU PAT

[1:39:13] <%spinalwizard> A hat in time is fun to play.
[1:39:14] <@SSaryn> Hat In Time's Seal with Deal update IS challenging, Hat in Time is not challenging.
[1:39:14] <GenericTwitchAcc1> DansGame OUTSIDE
[1:39:14] <+Krimxon> outside is very much not free

I used to watch it religiously, every day when I would get home from school I would pop the disk into the DvD player and just sit there watching the movie on repeat for hours. But I knew that it couldn't last forever I knew that one day I would have to return the DVD to the library. One day when I got home from school my mom said to me "sacul, I got a call from the library and that sonic DVD is overdue we h
[1:39:17] <CaptainFrankincense> slime rancher stardew valley are also the same type of game
[1:39:17] <+khalcipher> what is wrong with Pat?
[1:39:18] <+BenevolentBeetle> Rather play animal Corsping
[1:39:18] <fairore> calm down guys it's not that serious guys
[1:39:18] <%zetoe> Animal crossing is a game for people without friends or cool things to pretend they have friends and cool things.
[1:39:18] <+PlaneWalkerDavid> Outside is fucking hot
[1:39:19] <$SleepyPB> chat, its not that you're wrong for liking animnal crossing, its just that he doesnt get the appeal of it
[1:39:19] <%GabeSweetMan> Hat in Time DLC will kick your ASS Pat.
[1:39:20] <+deliciousmocha> But outside doesn;t have cute animals I wanna fuck
[1:39:20] <tag545> outside requires standing up
[1:39:20] <Okashido> That it is. I won't deny there are other games that can be relaxing. Animal crossing is an endless loop of easy, charming, relaxing video game stuff. Same thing with . most farming simulators.
[1:39:21] <Fujiwara_92> outside, not é en free
[1:39:21] <eco419> Free

[1:39:38] <FrithnanthH> @AngriestPat Why max all jobs or even play FF14, I know you enjoy the gameplay and story (and monotonous grinding I guess), but I don't and am actively repulsed by all elements of it. What's the appeal FOR ME? This is your argument

[1:39:53] <Tennochief> Woolie would do it
[1:39:53] <+MisterRockett> You know how you got your Free Company house looking all nice and the way you want it? Some people just want a game of that. Where the end game is getting the biggest house with all of the furniture they want and a town they've altered and made look nice.
[1:39:54] <%mistersups> apatWrong
[1:39:54] <+Ablestron> I dont play animal crossing but hey maybe its that you get to organize your cute house surrounded by actually cute animal neihgbors rather than actual weird human neighbors

[1:56:10] <$El_Desperad0> They could change it, Pat
[1:56:11] <+Th3SmartAlec> Pat, I guess DMC2 is just when we realized Devil May Cry is awful
[1:56:16] <Ipsenscastle> Nuts and Bolts was better than classic Banjo, and it wasn't very good
[1:56:17] <+MrTurtleThief> I bought Banjo Tooie as an adult and couldnt get through the first few levels, it's just a collectathon. Aged like fine milk @AngriestPat
[1:56:21] <The_Maddness> @AngriestPat Yeah, Umbrella Chronicles was crap, thats why resident evil 2 is the shittiest thing ever right?
[1:56:25] <FrithnanthH> Pat, the line between being an asshole intentionally and unintentionally is blurring for us and for you
[1:56:27] <Tcollins89> PAT tell me about DAUNTLESS??!!

[1:56:34] <%Konquerer> guys you can't fight him
[1:56:35] <Zaphire_Saucypants> Nuts and Bolts was not by any means an accurate barometer of Banjo Kazoowie.
[1:56:36] <%Reizie_Etherealm> DMC 2 is the pinnacle of DMC
[1:56:37] <%megabrogus> pod at 2?
[1:56:37] <%mistersups> But what about the Zapping System ***
[1:56:44] <%xyz297> @angriestpat I totally understand what you mean by not caring about the smash bros dlc characters. neither of them were Sora or Riku or Aqua

[1:57:43] <LegitBarnacleBoy> @AngriestPat last year at E3 bethesda got ridiculed for showing a short cinematic saying "elder scrolls 6" with no other information than it's in development. This zelda trailer is essentially that with barely more information, and people are creaming themselves over ir.

[1:57:54] <+Th3SmartAlec> Pat, just say you don't care
[1:57:54] <Psyramics> Also Pat: Everyone who enjoys Fate is a poopoo dumhead
[1:57:54] <+smevvster> Okay but Pat, when people say "Yo you're dumb" to YOU, you assume they're buthurt and taking it personally.
[1:57:55] <Deimos002> "You're dumb" said the angry man

[1:58:01] <Ipsenscastle> I literally watched a compilation of you flipping out about the zapping system yesterday
[1:58:01] <$FlubbedPig> The reason it hurts their feelings is because you're a person they like and look up to in some regard
[1:58:02] <King_Wolf_Rigger> PERFECT
[1:58:02] <%SleepyDavid> but you nearly killed woolie when he didn't understand the zapping system
[1:58:04] <%RobotPancake> No Pat I NEEEED YOU to like it so I can feel validatedddd

[2:06:16] <@SSaryn> @CaptainFrankincense It sure does. But that's why I also said just get a MonHun, MonHun does the same thing but still has more variety and still has ways to use the other moves in the first place.
[2:06:17] <SnakeVash> I need whisky
[2:06:26] <nvst4rk> I'm sorry mod-chan
[2:06:30] <Intolerable> Elmo = Pat's viewers
[2:06:32] <SchroedingersFerret> With the success of the Zelda open world concept, a direct sequel with the same engine seems like the smoothest way to integrate dungeons back in.
