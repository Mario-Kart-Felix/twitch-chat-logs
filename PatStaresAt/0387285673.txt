[0:24:55] <$MajorCrasher> HA SUCK IT
[0:24:58] <%Typhaeon> But console games don't depreciate in value like PC games go
[0:25:00] <Fatman2124> white ppl steal from minorites again
[0:25:00] <%CerberusDriver> 89.99 in canada ;_;
[0:25:03] <%ElenaManetta> you can waste more time doing steam trades for FREE
[0:25:04] <%laserbeaming> It depends in how many games you're gonna play
[0:25:05] <callsigneagle01> did anyone ever actually draw Peach as an Su-57?
[0:25:06] <%lewdskeletor13> I prefer console, but that‚Äôs just me
[0:25:06] <KaptainKappathe5th> not if you dont get a damn supercomputer
[0:25:09] <+these_pockets> If you get a forever game like Binding of Isaac (that's really good on switch) and enjoy it, you can suplement your price and keep your money for the really important games
[0:25:10] <london_flexing> Exactly
[0:25:14] <%DirtyGaijin> A PC will last you longer but console is cheaper

[0:47:32] <%awsomesaucekirby> cheer500 hey pat, been watching some of the paige plays DS1 and boy how does it hurt. I had a question for the podcast back in the day, that is no longer applicable since you split. Basically because you 3 were 467th in line for the ministership of the newly annexed providence of Mississippi east (from the big M to the coast) after canada took it. With almost unlimited power, what would be the first thing you'd do
[0:47:38] <%PlainSimpleTailor> I wish Jim and Pat would do the Fusion Dance. The sarcasm would be too much for the world to handle.

[1:09:39] <$cureneckbeard> vee-hicle
[1:09:41] <%CommanderSqueaks> @AngriestPat By the way, a significant part of the Earth's internet is handled through oceanic fiber lines and the military has several methods of communications that don't use satellites, so we wouldn't experience an internet apocalypse if some jackasses decided to shoot down our satellites.
[1:09:41] <DraxTD> so @AngriestPat , after hearing "today" and LAST week's podcast, I got to know.... IS there a member of your family that isn't crazy in some way??

[1:22:59] <gbrincks> If you hold circle, you get Missile cam
[1:23:00] <%R0bobot> Easier identifity
[1:23:01] <fusioncell12> @AngriestPat It lets you ID uknowns easier
[1:23:02] <+Pelodance> it looks awesome
[1:23:03] <%QueequegTheater> @AngriestPat It look cool
[1:23:05] <callsigneagle01> Free Erusia was a thing in AC5 where they were a rebel and terrorist faction that kept rising up in USEA
[1:23:05] <subjectg> Also let‚Äôs you keep track
[1:23:06] <%McSnazzyPants> @AngriestPat so when you're just turning wondering "where is he" you can just put the camera on them
[1:23:07] <sileo_patronus> To see why you missed
[1:23:08] <PoopyDickens> bitchin bett
[1:23:09] <$cureneckbeard> Hold shift for focused movement!
[1:23:13] <%ThePuddingDead> @QueequegTheater pretty much
[1:23:13] <+jotaro_cooljo> @AngriestPat the point is it looks cool when you fly while focused also it helps identify unkowns faster
[1:23:20] <callsigneagle01> So they're the radicals, or at least part of the radicals, that caused this
[1:23:26] <fusioncell12> @AngriestPat Also helps with spatial awarness
[1:23:30] <%McSnazzyPants> @AngriestPat also gives id faster on unknowns
[1:23:30] <%CommanderSqueaks> apatHoldon apatHoldon apatHoldon apatHoldon
[1:23:31] <%nofestu2> apatHoldon
[1:23:33] <callsigneagle01> Basically Free Erusia got sold some Belkan tech and started the war
[1:23:34] <PoopyDickens> Erusea did nothing wrong
[1:23:42] <$cureneckbeard> missl
[1:23:48] <%QueequegTheater> Erusea did many things wrong
[1:23:49] <+jotaro_cooljo> @AngriestPat also using the camera focus makes dog fights easier to keep track of
[1:23:49] <PortableToasterOven> PunOko ‚õµ
[1:23:56] <Mobius243> So missions 15 -20 is the best part of the game
[1:23:57] <+Reizie_Etherealm> It helps to let you know which way you should turn if you can't tell which direction they are behind you
[1:24:06] <callsigneagle01> true
[1:24:06] <%R0bobot> It absolutely does Pat
[1:24:06] <PoopyDickens> erusea wasn't bombing civilians
[1:24:07] <triangularblasphemy> @QueequegTheater For example: Trusted Belka
[1:24:11] <PoopyDickens> osea was
[1:24:22] <fusioncell12> @AngriestPat It means you can ID a target whilst moving away from it
[1:24:24] <callsigneagle01> Now to be fair it's not like AC5.
[1:24:25] <xtremegamer80> How does that work?
[1:24:26] <%McSnazzyPants> it was literally faster LUL
[1:24:28] <triangularblasphemy> I mean don't get me wrong, I got nothing against Belka
[1:24:32] <%QueequegTheater> @triangularblasphemy also tried to use Stongehenge to genocide the ISAF
[1:24:32] <gekizenbu> #longlivebelka
[1:24:35] <BonewheelVanguard> Everyone in this game did something wrong at some point
[1:24:37] <%R0bobot> It also means you don't have to point straight at them to do it
[1:24:39] <vindaxxv> man i hope ne blind fires and kits an ally
[1:24:39] <callsigneagle01> Belka isn't DIRECTLY behind it, they just sold them weapons to radicals
[1:24:40] <gbrincks> @PoopyDickens Yeah, well, maybe those civilians shouldn't have been born in the wrong country then
[1:24:40] <RantingRavager> OOPS
[1:24:42] <Halospaz117> Pat whats important is that the camera is on the enemy, not that the plane is pointed towards it
[1:24:42] <+Pelodance> LUL
[1:24:43] <thelonechris> Whoops
[1:24:50] <subjectg> !warcrimes
[1:24:53] <%Engwithan_Elder_God> Do they seriously not have radios in these planes? Does this world seriously only use satellite communication?
[1:24:56] <triangularblasphemy> But they gotta just get a root beer, try the dating scene, walk in a park
[1:24:59] <$cureneckbeard> uh-oh, war crimes
[1:25:03] <%MaiHusbando9S> oopsie poopsie
[1:25:03] <callsigneagle01> @Engwithan_Elder_God they do dude
[1:25:05] <Xiangchang> EVO 2019's lineup is being shown right now! It looks like Super Smash Melee might finally not make it!
[1:25:08] <%QueequegTheater> CAUTION
[1:25:08] <callsigneagle01> That's how they're talking right now
[1:25:09] <gekizenbu> @Engwithan_Elder_God apparently so
[1:25:11] <%QueequegTheater> PULL UP
[1:25:15] <callsigneagle01> It's a matter of strategic blackout
[1:25:15] <gbrincks> Oops, All War Crimes!
[1:25:15] <Mobius243> @Engwithan_Elder_God The Osean command is on a completely different continent
[1:25:19] <%ThePuddingDead> the fact those missiles weaved past those tethers on the bridge was pretty sick
[1:25:24] <Dull_Fangs> FORESHADOWING
[1:25:25] <Patzzki217> it doesnt take faster, it just helps that you dont have to point your plane towards an unknown target to identify them
[1:25:26] <callsigneagle01> also what Mobius said
[1:25:27] <DesuDesuDokiDoki> penal units LUL
[1:25:29] <StromkoPenguin> @Engwithan_Elder_God I think he meant he also had a civilian AM/FM radio, not just the military comms they're using
[1:25:31] <PoopyDickens> DOWN WITH OSEA SwiftRage
[1:25:33] <%QueequegTheater> Yes Pat please keep firebombing the civilian office buildings
[1:25:35] <thelonechris> Took out that apartment building though
[1:25:36] <$senorpapel> @xiangchang did it happen? Did all the melee players kill melee?
[1:25:48] <triangularblasphemy> What a thematically awesome mission
[1:25:48] <%Starlight_Gamer> you want war crimes..... this game has war cimes
[1:26:00] <%QueequegTheater> NotLikeThis
[1:26:00] <callsigneagle01> But yes the satellites thing is crazy but it's ACTUALLY possible
[1:26:08] <Gorgen> war crimes are fun for the whole family
[1:26:09] <callsigneagle01> The USAF has such missiles developed in the Cold War
[1:26:10] <+Reizie_Etherealm> Does anyone here know why Belka is so technologically advanced to develop autonomous AI? (Meme answer)
[1:26:13] <%McSnazzyPants> kessler syndrome is a thing
[1:26:14] <+Pelodance> tunnel PogChamp
[1:26:18] <Mobius243> Kessler Syndrome is a bitch
[1:26:20] <RantingRavager> GO IN THE TUNNEL

[1:29:35] <%Tokanova> oopsie woopsie we made a fucksy wucksy
[1:29:35] <callsigneagle01> Back in AC2 one of the ZOE drone aces was an F-18. In this mission you fight drone F-18s
[1:29:43] <callsigneagle01> So it's ZOE
[1:29:44] <Captain_matt> SO Hot Take. This stretch until the end of the game. is the strongest batch of missions in the franchise
[1:29:48] <splatty1> and after the truce all that they need to do is figure out how to stop the now uncontrolled drone fleet.... oh Kappa
[1:29:49] <%QueequegTheater> "But there are like 5 more missions, Karl"
[1:29:52] <callsigneagle01> also that means the Belkans had a hand in developing ZOE

[1:35:18] <Huntercd> Skynet?
[1:35:18] <Serge_12> poor melee
[1:35:19] <%QueequegTheater> @callsigneagle01 It's proto-Skynet
[1:35:19] <starotter70> This game is a fucking trip
[1:35:21] <+valkuma> Drones only need 1 missile
[1:35:21] <Worldbrand> the final boss of ace combat 8 will be windows 10
[1:35:22] <@Moobot> Whoa I don't even shout that much! (@LokimenD) (warning)
[1:35:23] <%crimsonharvest> Why do the drones have elective and command authority
[1:35:24] <+Michaeru_GT> Indeed, 1 missile kill for a dro- you got it
[1:35:25] <%Remery_> Degenerates?
[1:35:29] <%Piemen99> @callsigneagle01 but skynet is more fun
[1:35:33] <gbrincks> Count: "Who's the dumbass that did this?" Wesker: "Whoever it was, I'm sure he's a pretty cool guy"
[1:35:35] <gustavozxd> under night is a main game at Evo what the fucking hell!? PogChamp
[1:35:35] <PortableToasterOven> PogChamp laam
[1:35:36] <PoopyDickens> praise wondrous Belkan technology o7
[1:35:37] <callsigneagle01> @QueequegTheater It's also literally NOT THAT. These guys don't have free will
[1:35:38] <+dramajoe> melee finally died
[1:35:39] <+Reizie_Etherealm> Don't worry @callsigneagle01 a little misinformation doesn't hurt if it makes the experience more fun for them
[1:35:41] <+cvp5127> no doa6 tho
[1:35:43] <%CerberusDriver> samurai showdown at evo
[1:35:46] <callsigneagle01> They just lack advanced data

[1:35:54] <Dull_Fangs> what a japanese line
[1:35:55] <callsigneagle01> No
[1:35:56] <SirDogBear> schroder needs a silver chip
[1:35:59] <%Divryne> @AngriestPat No he's regretting super hard.
[1:36:00] <%LogothX> They need the BLISE engine
[1:36:01] <DiaDiaDiamond> So does pat know about Melee yet
[1:36:01] <DesuDesuDokiDoki> hehehe
[1:36:02] <callsigneagle01> He's literally theorizing how to stop it Pat
[1:36:06] <+valkuma> the drones have no pilots in them why would you feel bad
[1:36:06] <moonmeh> he's regretting it
[1:36:09] <The_Blumper> thats teh BEST time to be a super villian
[1:36:09] <%Laecerelius> Wesker's a fucking technoheretic. Color me not surprised.
[1:36:10] <+Reizie_Etherealm> Good dodge!
[1:36:15] <%CommanderSqueaks> He's thinking that maybe they should have put a fail safe on the intelligent autonomous drones.
[1:36:17] <splatty1> is the doctor saying that he should have put an off switch on them and that it didn't occur to him before?
[1:36:18] <%Engwithan_Elder_God> Yeah. He's pissed your doing it so easy. Plus he's unhappy they're trying to kill him.
[1:36:19] <Worldbrand> you also got flares, i know it aint stylish
[1:36:19] <ssks123> @AngriestPat doctor didnt put the drive in that tells the drones when to stop fighting
[1:36:20] <%kiiiirsten> apatBig dizzy
[1:36:22] <WorstCompany> He‚Äôs pulling a face turn because you‚Äôre saving him
[1:36:24] <%TheSpiritof2277> Ah, classic Japanese ambiguity in the script
[1:36:24] <+shawntk_> melee confirmed dead
[1:36:25] <42nfl19> What doesn't make sense is HOW MANY ROCKETS YOU AHVE
[1:36:26] <fusioncell12> They're no Nemo that's for sure
[1:36:35] <%RioGascar> @angriestpat well you did it. Melee is finally dead
[1:36:37] <triangularblasphemy> @callsigneagle01 no worries friend, Skynet is just shorthand for "the machine will not obey me." A broken coffee machine is Skynet now
[1:36:37] <%CommanderSqueaks> And the Liason is like "These drones are fucking cool!"
[1:36:39] <callsigneagle01> These guys right now ARENT SKYNET, they're just following their whole faulty programming. That's why he said there should be a time where it 'shouldn't function'
[1:36:40] <%R0bobot> Look at the FLAT Strangereal below!

[1:53:22] <%Das_Bass> just be good right
[1:53:22] <Halospaz117> You need the camera to look at them, not point the plane at them to identify
[1:53:23] <ignisacer> Pat you are a plane, stop trying to be a ground unit
[1:53:24] <%MaiHusbando9S> it will ID them withou you flying straight at the ground
[1:53:24] <+d00msdaydan> @AngriestPat you just have to look at them to id, even through buildings
[1:53:24] <Polengoldur> If You Focus On Them, They ID Faster
[1:53:24] <roymcdonald> so it seems like melee is not going to be at evo this year.

[2:00:25] <ItIsSky> if you use the camera lock from holding triangle, it supposedly locks faster
[2:00:26] <Mobius243> @AngriestPat If you hold triangle you can maneuver while keep line of sight with a target
[2:00:27] <Abecale> MELEE IS DEAD
[2:00:29] <%CommanderSqueaks> Hold triangle so your plane flies straight, and then point the camera at them.
[2:00:30] <Gamblitz> you don't have to dive on enemies with triangle hold just fly within 5000M
[2:00:31] <Worldbrand> This one took me several tries, but pat's a better pilot than me
[2:00:31] <%McSnazzyPants> @AngriestPat it's called holding triangle
[2:00:34] <PortableToasterOven> Holding triangle: you can id the enemy without pointing your plane at them.
[2:00:35] <+jotaro_cooljo> @AngriestPat with the camera focus you can point the camera at enemies without needing to fly in their direction. just try doing a loop or something while holding triangle to see what we mean.
[2:00:36] <blackcloud288> Long live Melee
[2:00:37] <%R0bobot> @AngriestPat Hold Triangle, and you can aim the plane in another direction. That way you aren;t aiming at the ground and the ID easier
[2:00:37] <BonewheelVanguard> fire both the gun and laser at the same time, it makes it twice as effective
[2:00:39] <caol2017> thats not what hydration bot meant
[2:00:40] <+Mr_Initials> Everyone knows melee is dead
[2:00:42] <%Reizie_Etherealm> @AngriestPat It's just for target identification, you don't have to use the triangle if it's a bother cause I didn't use it for mine either

[2:06:59] <The_Blumper> Earusian War Crimes are the best War Crimes
[2:07:00] <%Divryne> @AngriestPat Dive bomb tactics and shit.
[2:07:00] <AirlineFood74> you won't crash if you start high and dive
[2:07:01] <Gamblitz> fly level
[2:07:02] <%Tokanova> lasers are super long range
[2:07:03] <PoopyDickens> BUTTERFLY IN THE SKY
[2:07:03] <%QueequegTheater> You keep crashing into the fucking ground
[2:07:03] <%CommanderSqueaks> Don't fly too High, but also don't drag your plane's dick on the ground.
[2:07:04] <+TreeeFOX> go up and fly low. but good
[2:07:04] <%king_of_the_skies_dom> you dont need to shoot them, just ID all targets
[2:07:04] <+Gohyakuen> to identify a bunch of them
[2:07:06] <%anticrust> @AngriestPat Attack from a steeper angle
[2:07:06] <%R0bobot> Just bee urself
[2:07:07] <Worldbrand> Just dont stall
[2:07:08] <+Mr_Initials> yeah higher than 0
[2:07:11] <%Starlight_Gamer> flying high will prevent you from crashing
[2:07:11] <+justianxix> you won't stall to rhe ground
[2:07:14] <AirlineFood74> @AngriestPat lasers are super long range and if you dive bomb you won't crash
[2:07:15] <%templar010> @callsigneagle01 My Little Ace Combat cant be this serbian film
[2:07:17] <Fujiwara_92> you look down, shoot, then go high, and repeat
[2:07:22] <+Pelodance> fly faster pat
[2:07:22] <Videogamer4> FailFish FailFish FailFish
[2:07:22] <%anticrust> NO Its faster and more accurate
[2:07:23] <ÂàáÊç®Âæ°ÂÖç> you just fuckin crash is what you do
[2:07:24] <%MaiHusbando9S> and then do big stalls and crash
[2:07:24] <tag545> shooting buildings waste time and ammo
[2:07:25] <%Reizie_Etherealm> Fly however you want
[2:07:25] <callsigneagle01> @templar010 you're not wrong tbh
[2:07:26] <+drflashylights> vineStank
[2:07:26] <Gamblitz> just stay level
[2:07:27] <krymzen5> it lets you stall without risk
[2:07:27] <AirlineFood74> but you crash when you fly low
[2:07:28] <%Starlight_Gamer> dont fly low and slow
[2:07:29] <+Salvation122> And then stall and die
[2:07:31] <%MostFrank> dying wastes more time
[2:07:34] <+Pelodance> he's gona stall again

[2:07:37] <%TheSpiritof2277> just speed up after a high g turn 4Head
[2:07:37] <+Gohyakuen> Yeah that clearly NEVER backfired!
[2:07:38] <asurite_warrior> This seems like a mission for the BRRRRRRT!! machine.
[2:07:39] <%crimsonharvest> And your super useful stall speed lets it happen
[2:07:40] <PoopyDickens> fly faster or you'll stall @AngriestPat

[2:07:49] <%wolfofsound> flawless logic
[2:07:51] <%QueequegTheater> @AngriestPat Ah, I see the confusion. Pat, flying low is for people who are GOOD at this game
[2:07:52] <PoopyDickens> ok :)
[2:07:56] <+Techno_Shinobi> If you're going to do that, you might as well use the A-10.
[2:07:59] <+justianxix> only need one try LUL
[2:08:01] <%Starlight_Gamer> LUL
[2:08:01] <%anticrust> Oooof
[2:08:01] <%king_of_the_skies_dom> you only need to ID pat
[2:08:02] <%Reizie_Etherealm> It's fine! He won't stall if he's careful!
[2:08:04] <%templar010> Unknown monkaS
[2:08:04] <%skizzuto> but it's less fast overall if you have to do the mission 4+ times
[2:08:04] <Fujiwara_92> ok :|
[2:08:04] <%crimsonharvest> Ah i see that pat can't perceive sunk cost

[2:08:46] <redsynod> Ok
[2:08:47] <Mobius243> @AngriestPat You save time if you don't let off the afterburners and do fast runs instead of slow and low
[2:08:49] <%Starlight_Gamer> @king_of_the_skies_dom you mean the last part of the mission?

[2:09:38] <Polengoldur> clearly you didn't fly low enough @AngriestPat
[2:09:38] <callsigneagle01> Stalling is from lack of speed, so don't knee-jerk and pul the brakes. Hit the gas
[2:09:39] <%TheSpiritof2277> it'll be fine as long as you faceplant the ground
[2:09:40] <AirlineFood74> @AngriestPat high-g turns make you go CLOW

[2:09:41] <Captain_matt> yes. but the A-10's going to get fucked on the second half of the mission

[2:09:53] <Bakefowl> I thought u wouldn‚Äôt stall Kappa
[2:09:53] <%Laecerelius> That's why you fly higher, Pat
[2:09:55] <+Pelodance> FLY FASTER LUL
[2:09:55] <TerryTheTurret> I mean you still do so worth a try rooShrug
[2:09:55] <lloyddboy> SO GO HIGHER
[2:09:58] <%rdark_ksu> have you tried moving side to side?
[2:09:58] <%crimsonharvest> Thats why the only currency in the air is altitude
[2:09:59] <%king_of_the_skies_dom> your in the perfect plane for this
[2:09:59] <HiddenPorpoise> You are in a ballistic craft
[2:09:59] <fusioncell12> @AngriestPat You stall from being slow
[2:10:02] <+justianxix> pull up
[2:10:02] <%Divryne> @AngriestPat You're pulling high G turns right out of a stall so you slow back down.
[2:10:03] <+Techno_Shinobi> Maybe if there was more space between you and the ground
[2:10:04] <%R0bobot> Dig up stupid
[2:10:04] <%CommanderSqueaks> @MaiHusbando9S But being close to the ground is so much faster than dive bombing.
[2:10:06] <ekirbo> then speed up and turn the plane away from the ground?
[2:10:06] <Tucker0603> 11111111111
[2:10:08] <SoaringLettuce> no you wont
[2:10:09] <+THEmetallicfloyd> You guys see how EVO is gonna come "crawling" back to melee next year? LUL
[2:10:09] <%QueequegTheater> Moobot is being a real cunt
[2:10:09] <%afronooch> Try spinning
[2:10:10] <lloyddboy> YOU'RE NOT A CHOPPER PAT
[2:10:11] <LORDSPOOKLEKINS> 11111111
[2:10:12] <%ThePuddingDead> its like he never watched Iron Man 1 before or somehting
[2:10:13] <callsigneagle01> I try so hard man
[2:10:13] <PoopyDickens> just go faster 4Head
[2:10:14] <moonmeh> everyone getting muted lmao
[2:10:15] <Videogamer4> 1
[2:10:16] <splucher> missile missile missile
[2:10:20] <Pasternak19> LUL
[2:10:22] <dekkitout> This is quite the catch-22, fly low so he can ping targets, or fly high to mitigate stall issues
[2:10:27] <therealkeystone> keep your speed over about 260 when you turn and you won't stall
[2:10:28] <+Pelodance> NOT HIGH JUST FAST
[2:10:29] <%Reizie_Etherealm> @AngriestPat Don't high G turning if you know you aren't fast enough for it. The minimum speed is at least 650 kph for a full turn
[2:10:31] <%Divryne> YES.
[2:10:32] <42nfl19> Go fast and only have time to scan, have to do a second to kill them at times. As an industrial engineer this inefficiency is making me hurt
[2:10:32] <ÂàáÊç®Âæ°ÂÖç> YES
[2:10:33] <KaptainKappathe5th> yes
[2:10:33] <lloyddboy> YES
[2:10:33] <callsigneagle01> yeah that works
[2:10:34] <%CommanderSqueaks> Yes
[2:10:34] <AirlineFood74> @AngriestPat !!TIP!! don't do high-g turns when you're stalling
[2:10:34] <Polengoldur> YERS
[2:10:35] <%MaiHusbando9S> yarp
[2:10:36] <AirlineFood74> YES PLS
[2:10:38] <restingtitan> YES
[2:10:38] <%wolfofsound> high and fast almost like a PLANE
[2:10:39] <Videogamer4> pat for ffs STALL and then when your stalling go fast for fast turning
[2:10:40] <ShichiNoBushi> You need to remember how wings and lift work. If there's not enough speed and air traveling over and under the wing, you don't get enough lift.
[2:10:41] <%king_of_the_skies_dom> just roller coaster it pat
[2:10:41] <+justianxix> holy shit PogChamp
[2:10:42] <SoaringLettuce> pat, flying like you do results in you crashing, stop thinking youre right
[2:10:44] <zaptar13> Like a plane yeah
[2:10:45] <RetributionP> if you speed up you "grip" the air so you can turn sharper
[2:10:46] <+punit216> Maybe change planes to something that is harder to stall
[2:10:46] <%Starlight_Gamer> energy maneuvers
[2:10:48] <krymzen5> yes
[2:10:48] <fusioncell12> Pretty much yes
[2:10:49] <%kiiiirsten> LUL
[2:10:51] <Fujiwara_92> yeah, and keeping speed
[2:10:53] <%QueequegTheater> WHy are you swooping at all
[2:10:55] <Worldbrand> However you want is fine, just mind your speed
[2:10:55] <+Techno_Shinobi> repeat that, but faster
[2:10:56] <LORDSPOOKLEKINS> so is dying 5 times LUL
[2:10:57] <%AlopekisPup> There's no reason to dive bomb on this mission.
[2:10:57] <Polengoldur> that is how plane combat works
[2:10:58] <%CommanderSqueaks> "Waste of time" Death Count = 5
[2:11:00] <fruit_pie_the_magician> Dude. It' a plane. SHoot things from big up
[2:11:01] <%MaiHusbando9S> your dying a lot wasnt a waste of time tho
[2:11:01] <%Starlight_Gamer> so boom and zoom tactics
[2:11:03] <%Reizie_Etherealm> It is slower but you'll be safer
[2:11:03] <Dingo_Eejit> grip the ai
[2:11:04] <ÂàáÊç®Âæ°ÂÖç> dying 5 times because you stall 500 feet above the ground is wasting more time
[2:11:08] <SoaringLettuce> if you keep crashing is cause youre doing something wrong
[2:11:09] <PoopyDickens> flying like an actual pilot is a waste of time Kappa
[2:11:09] <+TreeeFOX> pats plane is considered a ground unit
[2:11:11] <AirlineFood74> "Waste of time" death count = 5
[2:11:12] <+Mr_Initials> its a waste of time if you are good at the game
[2:11:14] <tag545> pat cant handle being tall
[2:11:17] <%gespenst25> did you never listen to Ace's high?
[2:11:21] <%Divryne> @AngriestPat Center of camera.
[2:11:21] <+justianxix> target
[2:11:23] <PoopyDickens> @tag545 LUL
[2:11:26] <DesuDesuDokiDoki> pat u know those ships are enemies
[2:11:30] <$cureneckbeard> Fighter jet cannons have an effective range of like 6 km
[2:11:32] <%ThePuddingDead> crazy people!
[2:11:36] <fusioncell12> @AngriestPat It takes time for them to be ID'ed
[2:11:37] <Gamblitz> fly about 700m, then loop-d-loop upward and shoot with lasers
[2:11:41] <Mobius243> @AngriestPat Boom and Zoom, when you pull up stay on the afterburners and only slow down if you are lining up a shot
[2:11:44] <%king_of_the_skies_dom> stop shoot at things by the Mass driver, theres no friendlys and its to waiste your time not saving the 10 on map
[2:11:48] <Dingo_Eejit> Big Grips for Bigximum manuevers
[2:11:51] <AirlineFood74> Pat just shoot at them, you know their enemies and you can't fail the mission for shooting at unknown hostiles
[2:11:51] <%QueequegTheater> STOP DOING HIGH G
[2:11:54] <SauceJockey> hes gonna fucking stall again
[2:12:00] <fusioncell12> @AngriestPat The closer and more centered the better
[2:12:01] <%CommanderSqueaks> @AirlineFood74 ^
[2:12:02] <%Kirbachev> When I played this I expected JRPG-style goofiness, I was thrown for a loop when things got this fucking bleak
[2:12:08] <triangularblasphemy> Shout outs to those war crime recorders on the ground. Cool dudes
[2:12:09] <AirlineFood74> teaching pat how to do high-g turns was a MISTAKE
[2:12:13] <fusioncell12> @AngriestPat or faster rather
[2:12:21] <%QueequegTheater> @Kirbachev Yeah this is easily one of the darkest points in the series
[2:12:25] <flyingsnakes3> So I've been playing this in VR and with a flight stick, it's amazing.
[2:12:26] <triangularblasphemy> Its the apocalypse and they are still getting records. Good stuff
[2:12:27] <Dingo_Eejit> Seize the Sky
[2:12:27] <%Reizie_Etherealm> @AngriestPat You don't have to identify if you shoot manually with laser gun, taps head
[2:12:29] <$cureneckbeard> yeah the doggo died
[2:12:30] <+dj_berserk_ix> atpQuan
[2:12:30] <AirlineFood74> SPEED UP THEN
[2:12:37] <+ren173> @AngriestPat Any thoughts on the death of melee?
[2:12:37] <AirlineFood74> It takes forever because you're going slow
[2:12:44] <%Starlight_Gamer> are the vr missions tough?
[2:12:46] <%CommanderSqueaks> Because Impatience has always been a good trait for a pilot.
[2:12:51] <Fujiwara_92> SPEED S P E E D
[2:12:54] <+ren173> Melee is not at EVO this year
[2:12:55] <callsigneagle01> nice
[2:12:58] <Worldbrand> pew pew
[2:12:58] <+justianxix> the turtle wins the race pat
[2:13:00] <+Name_Meme> NotLikeThis
[2:13:00] <%wolfofsound> pat feels the need the need for moderate pacing
[2:13:03] <+Wool> HungryBox broke down on stream
[2:13:08] <Thakan_dar> Melee is d e a d
[2:13:09] <+Pelodance> FailFish
[2:13:10] <Gamblitz> loop d loop
[2:13:13] <SauceJockey> he's finally starting to grasp the basics of ground attack in the THIRD TO LAST MISSION
[2:13:17] <Videogamer4> FailFish
[2:13:18] <%king_of_the_skies_dom> that yellow convoy has 1 friendly and 3 enemies but you waste so much time by the Mass driver the friendly stops and is killed
[2:13:19] <%Engwithan_Elder_God> Just do what's working.
[2:13:21] <%CommanderSqueaks> Swoop down from a distance, stop trying to do everything so tight.
[2:13:22] <AirlineFood74> just swoop down while looking at them. shocking I know
[2:13:24] <KaptainKappathe5th> swoop down, fire two, go back up, repeat
[2:13:24] <%ace_cfa44> the SU-57 also has low anti ground stats which makes locking on to ground targets take longer @AngriestPat
[2:13:28] <+zaworldo> YEAH LASER
[2:13:30] <dekkitout> Peregrine Falcon-like arcs?
[2:13:30] <%ThePuddingDead> u turn the plane DOWN so u can SWOOP! Stop fighting perfectly sound common SENSE!
[2:13:36] <Tucker0603> @angriestpat this is faster than dieing 5 times to the same thing
[2:13:36] <AirlineFood74> ^
[2:13:36] <BonewheelVanguard> @AngriestPat you can fire the gun and laser at the same time for a better time to kill
[2:13:38] <%Reizie_Etherealm> Oh man, I remember never letting go of the afterburner on the Ace of Aces difficulty in Ace Combat 6 because shit's hard
[2:13:43] <Sitromxe> @AngriestPat Go faster == Do everything faster == Get gud
[2:13:47] <fruit_pie_the_magician> I'm pretty sure they told you not to engage until you identify everything
[2:13:52] <%Starlight_Gamer> laser kinda balances the a to g for this plane
[2:13:55] <fruit_pie_the_magician> then just engage in bombing runs
[2:14:03] <%QueequegTheater> @fruit_pie_the_magician Allies will die if you do that
[2:14:06] <%CommanderSqueaks> @fruit_pie_the_magician You won't fail for shooting an enemy even if it's not identified.
[2:14:13] <Mobius243> @AngriestPat Not letting of the afterburner unless necessary is the key to success
[2:14:15] <%MaiHusbando9S> yes but you havent crashed into the ground yet
[2:14:19] <+Pelodance> just be faster and everything will be easier
[2:14:20] <$Retrocop87> HEY PAT! MISSLE!
[2:14:20] <callsigneagle01> You're not
[2:14:21] <%crimsonharvest> You're doing it more clean and without waste
[2:14:21] <Fujiwara_92> ya think Kappa
[2:14:25] <TikanZK> WHOS FLYING
[2:14:25] <+justianxix> be gud Kappa
[2:14:26] <%Reizie_Etherealm> Pat! Remember the basics of aviation!
[2:14:28] <AirlineFood74> @fruit_pie_the_magician yeah but as a player you can just shoot unknowns you know are enemies without consequence
[2:14:29] <PoopyDickens> but you havent died weird Kappa
[2:14:33] <Polengoldur> @AngriestPat why do you think the average mission timer is like 30 minutes?
[2:14:35] <%king_of_the_skies_dom> your not supposed to be killing everything in phase 1 @AngriestPat
[2:14:37] <%Superstarsage> PEW PEW
[2:14:39] <Fujiwara_92> you're doing better honestly Pat
[2:14:40] <%CommanderSqueaks> Do it slow, correctly then you can do it fast correctly, but do it correctly.
[2:14:47] <AirlineFood74> Is what's missing the not-dying part?
[2:14:52] <Worldbrand> Put peanut butter on your plane
[2:14:52] <triangularblasphemy> Half the ground forces are dead
[2:14:53] <%Reizie_Etherealm> The number one rule in plane manipulation is that there is no rule!
[2:14:54] <Dull_Fangs> FLARES PogChamp
[2:14:56] <%Starlight_Gamer> jet fighters need to replace guns with lasers
[2:14:57] <ÂàáÊç®Âæ°ÂÖç> BELKAAAAA
[2:15:01] <PoopyDickens> shoot the allies LUL
[2:15:01] <fusioncell12> He used flares
[2:15:02] <+Pelodance> shot an ally LUL
[2:15:06] <HiddenPorpoise> Go to afterburner and just go one and done on missiles
[2:15:12] <Gamblitz> you're fighting in the wrong area, you need to hit the middle and northern parts of the island
[2:15:14] <KaptainKappathe5th> THEN GO FASTER
[2:15:14] <fruit_pie_the_magician> Well yah but once you have everything identified, just do like two good passes and everyone wil be dead
[2:15:15] <%king_of_the_skies_dom> bombers are more important
[2:15:18] <PoopyDickens> it's the Osean way
[2:15:24] <%Reizie_Etherealm> You're doing okay! Don't worry about speed!
[2:15:30] <+Pelodance> LUL
[2:15:31] <Flunkorg> See?
[2:15:31] <%MaiHusbando9S> see how you stalled and DIDNT crash into the earth?
[2:15:32] <$cureneckbeard> Don't worry about it
[2:15:33] <ÂàáÊç®Âæ°ÂÖç> wow, you stalled and didn't die!
[2:15:35] <%king_of_the_skies_dom> Phase 2

[2:15:55] <%anticrust> @AngriestPat No Pat, you're just low
[2:15:55] <%king_of_the_skies_dom> only worry about the bombers or you will fail
[2:15:56] <%yoshkosh20> now watch as he collides with a plane in midair
[2:15:58] <%Starlight_Gamer> hit the bombers with lasers
[2:15:58] <FirearmsInstructor> I forgot it was Tuesday. ;( How long ago did the stream start? :)
[2:16:00] <JanusII> Yes, they're at about the height a jet flies. Kappa
[2:16:02] <+Tadashi047> you can shoot from long range with lasers
[2:16:02] <PortableToasterOven> PogChamp better health this time
[2:16:07] <%QueequegTheater> All of y'all Kreygasming just wait for Lighthouse
[2:16:09] <Fujiwara_92> Kill them all, Patter
[2:16:11] <%TheOnlyStrayCat> cheer500 if someone made a drinking game out of the amount of times you crashed today, they would be halfway to dead. Also, I have to ask, where do you have a schedule of streams? I was gonna do one in the next couple of days, but wanted to make sure I cut out before yours.

[2:19:51] <AirlineFood74> how many civvies is Pat going to kill in the next mission, chat?
[2:19:54] <%QueequegTheater> WHo am I kidding
[2:20:01] <+Tadashi047> you can get even more range with upgrades
[2:20:01] <%QueequegTheater> @AirlineFood74 ALl of them
[2:20:05] <%Reizie_Etherealm> @Polengoldur I personally agree, but for the sake of this game and moral standard I had to say it
[2:20:06] <AirlineFood74> a) none. b) half. c) all

[2:20:10] <Mobius243> @QueequegTheater To be fair, PSM is advanced

[2:32:13] <%Reizie_Etherealm> @fusioncell12 I mean from the military perspective, Ulysses was shown more in cutscenes and the damage didn't hinder us from flying. But here the disruption of the command structure and the military disorganization is affecting our group directly, like plane fuel and food and figuring out what to do
[2:32:14] <Admiral_PopnFresh> Erusians, justified in their anger at Osea, maybe not justified in starting hostilities

[2:35:41] <fusioncell12> This song's good
[2:35:41] <callsigneagle01> Basically despite them arguing BOTH of the girls believe they were right, but BOTH of them had logical reason and good ideas behind it and the game never fully says which side is right. So Harling's Mirror is the idea of that, fighting and seeing the world and 'looking into your soul' and you own beliefs
[2:35:42] <%ThePuddingDead> sooo roughly how long is this game?

[2:35:53] <callsigneagle01> WE think the princess is wrong, and she kinda is
[2:35:53] <frozenottsel> this sounds like a poorly thought out plan

[2:35:55] <%TheSpiritof2277> this song is so comfy
[2:35:55] <%CommanderSqueaks> Oh hey, they just gave you justification.
[2:35:58] <%Reizie_Etherealm> Don't ask! Just shoot!
[2:36:01] <callsigneagle01> BUT her idea about Harling isn't totally wrong
[2:36:03] <%ThePuddingDead> watch out for that TREE

[2:36:56] <%Starlight_Gamer> Not necessary to kill all targets
[2:36:57] <%Unlimited_> fuck YEAH
[2:36:57] <Admiral_PopnFresh> So, I do find it kinda hard to believe that all communication with the Osean mainland is lost, unless ALL long range communication in the Osean military is now digital. Osea has a big enough Navy and Air Force that it should be able to send messengers or new orders.
[2:36:57] <gbrincks> Rain PLSL on those children!
[2:36:57] <sevastapolnights> how's it feel to be the bad guy

[2:37:25] <%couch_potato_Ed_Boy> @AirlineFood74 @angrytiki Ah, that kinda sucks actually.
[2:37:26] <callsigneagle01> @Admiral_PopnFresh It's entierly possible. Osea's on another continent. It's probably not 100% cut off but it's enough to cause MASSIVE confusion
[2:37:32] <%TheSpiritof2277> Jaeger is a knowledgable dad
[2:37:34] <frozenottsel> and that makes it okay?
[2:37:37] <thebakaliyen> Melee out of Evo. My response: Good, now the hipsters will be forced to get with the times

[2:37:43] <KaptainKappathe5th> this music is so stupidly fucking ominous
[2:37:44] <callsigneagle01> @Admiral_PopnFresh it'd be like if US forces in Asia got cut off from the US proper

[2:38:36] <Dull_Fangs> @Mobius243 its been almost 2 years since rev 2 came out arc sy has barely supported the game since then. UNIST is way more deserving

[2:56:41] <friendlyrogue> I think I played 4 and I had a blast
[2:56:42] <+twohitgood> they had you sitting gunner in a helicopter, ffs! that's about the antithesis of ace combat.
[2:56:46] <fusioncell12> @Admiral_PopnFresh 1997 I think
[2:56:47] <gbrincks> What are we? Some kinda Strangereal?
[2:56:48] <%R0bobot> COOL ACES
[2:56:48] <+Sp3ctre48> Assault Horizon was the only one I played
[2:56:50] <%king_of_the_skies_dom> i heard you
[2:56:50] <+Scottigecko> Ace Combat 5 when Pat
[2:56:54] <+Shinmaddrox> The american verison of Ace Combat had the same effect to me as the american version of EDF. Boring
[2:56:55] <%Reizie_Etherealm> Pretty niche
[2:56:56] <+Name_Meme> A bit yeh
[2:56:57] <+Pelodance> it' sbasically metal with planes
[2:56:57] <+Sonikman102> ace combat 4 FeelsGoodMan
[2:56:57] <AirlineFood74> This game sold extremely well
[2:56:58] <%R0bobot> TUNNEL RUNS
[2:56:58] <$zalmezz> NEVER PLAY ASS HORT!
[2:56:59] <krymzen5> it is
[2:57:00] <%crimsonharvest> Flight Sim used to be one of the four kinds of game
[2:57:00] <callsigneagle01> I'd prefer it stay profitable niche. I don't want a ton of people in it too much
[2:57:01] <%lewdskeletor13> Very niche
[2:57:01] <+NPCMatro> it feels really good
[2:57:01] <SpaceGuntank> AC:AH is the black sheep of the series
[2:57:04] <triangularblasphemy> @QueequegTheater Just the commentary I expected from the Darkest Antiquarian
[2:57:06] <WorstCompany> Thoughts on Assault Horizon LEGACY, guys? The one that‚Äôs a remake of 2?
[2:57:08] <%Divryne> @AngriestPat It sold 7th best in January, so it's getting popular.
[2:57:10] <cerberuscarmine> lol
[2:57:14] <+drflashylights> Scublords intro SeemsGood
[2:57:16] <+Maids4lyfe> assault horizon was a mistake
[2:57:16] <Hammerknife> i wouldn't call it a niche series, kids like planes that can fly around and shoot ten million missiles
[2:57:18] <callsigneagle01> Oh lord
[2:57:21] <AirlineFood74> @WorstCompany never played it but apparently it's good so yea
[2:57:23] <+justianxix> here we go LUL
[2:57:23] <AirlineFood74> that's cool
[2:57:24] <%Starlight_Gamer> isnt the last mission of assult horizon scripted?
[2:57:24] <callsigneagle01> NOW we gettin into it
[2:57:25] <%supersugoisenpai1> Love this series to death
[2:57:25] <lionmanguy> It's time for the demon planes
[2:57:25] <%Divryne> HERE WE GO.
[2:57:27] <Mobius243> Mission 19 baby
[2:57:29] <SauceJockey> AC7 sold half a million in launch month in asia alone
[2:57:29] <Hammerknife> its just not cod
[2:57:29] <+Vanishingtrooper> I gave Assault Horizon a genuine shot to see whether it was bad through and through. It has some OK moments, but it's pretty weak in the story and music department, and the DFM system was pretty trash.

[3:20:04] <+Maids4lyfe> planes are just bigger missiles!
[3:20:06] <%kiiiirsten> Look how much he like it
[3:20:09] <xBolts4Lifex> he wanted an excuse to go to the bathroom
[3:20:10] <dekkitout> What is a plane, if not a missile?
[3:20:12] <+Demon_Ace_Cipher> he only makes the cat strongher
[3:20:12] <Worldbrand> give him the squish
[3:20:13] <RiverBirch> Can confirm, some cats like a pap
[3:20:13] <KaptainKappathe5th> smack his bag
[3:20:13] <$RaikenTB> Elmo, attack.
[3:20:16] <$cureneckbeard> yeyeyeye
[3:20:17] <%lewdskeletor13> BEAT THAT CAT
[3:20:17] <%king_of_the_skies_dom> planes are just big guided missiles
[3:20:18] <%TheSpiritof2277> he attac
[3:20:21] <+Spireman> gdqBlueFire gdqBlueFire gdqBlueFire gdqFAST
[3:20:22] <suikudo> All of the buildup and tension
[3:20:24] <alcors_wisdom> @filialpails didnt realize pat was japanese
[3:20:24] <%Remery_> Elmo is a masochist
[3:20:28] <+Demon_Ace_Cipher> Elmo is the true demon lord of the round table
[3:20:28] <Captain_Joe1911> notekMilk CurseLit break time
[3:20:28] <Foolofworms77> OK but FR, does pat know melee is dead!?
[3:20:31] <sevastapolnights> i hope pat likes MISISLE ALERT
[3:20:31] <Nighthawkmun> Do these people not cat?
[3:20:34] <aimlesshealer> >Man enraged by video game violently beats his cat
[3:20:34] <Captain_Joe1911> atpMunchies CurseLit
[3:20:35] <suikudo> just out like pats hot piss
[3:20:36] <studleydoorite> it does stop missiles, you were attacked to 80 of them
[3:20:38] <Foolofworms77> I dont wanna spam the chat if he does
[3:20:38] <%lewdskeletor13> @foolofworms77 He knows
[3:20:38] <sevastapolnights> because he's gonna see it a *LOT*
[3:20:47] <%Starlight_Gamer> So are the vr missions hard?
[3:20:49] <Foolofworms77> Aight good
[3:20:51] <%king_of_the_skies_dom> if he takes out the AMS he should be fine
[3:20:53] <Nighthawkmun> I always pat my buddy
[3:20:57] <+stevenlambchops> Planes in Ace Combat are basically metal Pokemon
[3:21:02] <alcors_wisdom> whats going on with melee
[3:21:03] <sevastapolnights> implying pat is gonna know what to target
[3:21:09] <+einherjarvalk> VR is hard if you‚Äôre not a flight oriented person
[3:21:12] <+dodge_and_dust> @alcors_wisdom out of EVO
[3:21:16] <%Reizie_Etherealm> He'll figure it out
[3:21:16] <%QueequegTheater> @alcors_wisdom Not one of the majors at EVO
[3:21:17] <+Demon_Ace_Cipher> melee no longer has a main spot at evo
[3:21:19] <suikudo> About time
[3:21:21] <+einherjarvalk> I had a blast, my buddy wanted to throw up after 5 minutes
[3:21:23] <alcors_wisdom> ah i see
[3:21:31] <Hammerknife> when will ace combat introduce melee weapons
[3:21:38] <%ElenaManetta> i want ground missions
[3:21:41] <%ElenaManetta> like in STAR FOX
[3:21:43] <BonewheelVanguard> DI they say why they pulled it from the evo roster
[3:21:43] <callsigneagle01> Alright so while we got a break how's everyone doing?
[3:21:44] <+Demon_Ace_Cipher> technically the laser is like a melee weapon
[3:21:44] <%Reizie_Etherealm> When they introduce mechs
[3:21:48] <callsigneagle01> Everyone good?
[3:21:49] <%Starlight_Gamer> Do the vr missions add anything to the story?
[3:21:49] <alcors_wisdom> basically the concept of early zero planes
[3:21:57] <+Demon_Ace_Cipher> mech ace combat is just armored core tho
[3:21:58] <callsigneagle01> Everyone keeping up with the plot?
[3:21:59] <SoaringLettuce> the laser works like a really long sword
[3:22:00] <PoopyDickens> @ElenaManetta ground is not sky though
[3:22:01] <%QueequegTheater> When AC8 comes out in 2034
[3:22:04] <alcors_wisdom> they would sharpen the wings so they could cut up enemy planes
[3:22:05] <+einherjarvalk> VR is a side story between 4 and 7
[3:22:07] <AirlineFood74> @Starlight_Gamer the VR missions are pretty much a prologue.
[3:22:12] <AirlineFood74> ^
[3:22:15] <+einherjarvalk> Basically like Operation Katina in 5
[3:22:18] <%Starlight_Gamer> Guess I‚Äôll do them
[3:22:18] <RollCritFail> Honestly I'd rather have Smash Ult and a Smash style/clone game than 2 Smash games at EVO
[3:22:25] <%QueequegTheater> Remember in 0 when MOBIUS FUCKING ONE was the arcade boss
[3:22:33] <RollCritFail> So I'm fine with Melee being gone
[3:22:42] <Mobius243> @starlight_gamer Fan service mostly, you get to play as the main character from Ace Combat 04
[3:22:42] <+Demon_Ace_Cipher> 0 with that final song
[3:22:45] <PoopyDickens> today is my birthday, a victory sure would be nice
[3:22:48] <+Demon_Ace_Cipher> spanish flamenco intensifies
[3:22:49] <callsigneagle01> I'm in a good mood
[3:22:51] <Dull_Fangs> French bread rise up
[3:22:55] <callsigneagle01> I'm gonna post flying poetry
[3:22:56] <%Reizie_Etherealm> @Demon_Ace_Cipher You're not even wrong. Maybe that's why I love both of them as the pinnacle of my childhood
[3:22:58] <%Starlight_Gamer> Mobius?
[3:22:59] <+einherjarvalk> If you listen super close you can hear how Free Erusia is plotting something and in 7 the radio comms imply they‚Äôre the Erusian officers that LaBarthe talked about who started the war
[3:23:01] <alcors_wisdom> i dont think melee is gone in the slightest yet but its probably going to wane off from here
[3:23:02] <callsigneagle01> "Because I fly I laugh more than other men I look up an see more than they, I know how the clouds feel, What it's like to have the blue in my lap, to look down on birds, to feel freedom in a thing called the stick"
[3:23:10] <SoaringLettuce> mobius shows up in the arcade killing the aces you THINK youre gonna fight xD
[3:23:12] <callsigneagle01> "who but I can slice between God's billowed legs, and feel then laugh and crash with His step Who else has seen the unclimbed peaks? The rainbow's secret? The real reason birds sing? Because I Fly, I envy no man on earth."
[3:23:18] <%QueequegTheater> @callsigneagle01 GOd damn I love this game so much. It's a complete love letter to the series. You beat Ace difficulty yet?
[3:23:29] <callsigneagle01> @QueequegTheater not yet
[3:23:35] <Endocrom> Just got here. What up?
[3:23:37] <sevastapolnights> S ranker on hard doing an Ace run myself
[3:23:37] <+Demon_Ace_Cipher> i like ah as a dumb side game
[3:23:40] <+Carlos_the_Hobo> It's flooding where I am
[3:23:41] <+einherjarvalk> Ace on this game is kind of weak

[3:25:36] <AirlineFood74> @GraveLordJeff only a billion times
[3:25:37] <%QueequegTheater> @Hammerknife Yeah, but the missions are generally longer than the older games
[3:25:38] <SoaringLettuce> thats a... big bird
[3:25:38] <ekirbo> @AngriestPat if you go for UAVs you'll have to shoot down 99

[4:35:29] <Joysta> Perfectly timed stream switch
[4:35:30] <%Laecerelius> I wonder if Melee people will now go to EVO to boo everything else
[4:35:31] <+paladinstarbuster> The evil is DEFEATED
[4:35:31] <+cvp5127> melee killed live
[4:35:34] <%Eaglestrike117> Its not at EVO

[4:35:56] <Zebroneath> No more smelly corners at EVO
[4:35:58] <stabbityrabbit> Samsho I think is an odd choice.
[4:36:01] <SulfurousAcid> It WAS A NIGHTMARE TO WATCH
[4:36:02] <%ElenaManetta> how are melee players going to pay the rent now
[4:36:02] <Admiral_PopnFresh> Uniest is surprising, to be honest, SamSho, not a surprise

[4:36:26] <%Nope80808> They are unhinged and thought forever
[4:36:26] <+Irridium> they're real upset
[4:36:26] <CriticKitten> Melee players thought it would stay forever.
[4:36:26] <SulfurousAcid> forever
[4:36:26] <+Lavanio> until viewership went down
[4:36:26] <DetroitSentai> Melee has plenty of other events that it is MAJOR at
[4:36:27] <%TheSpiritof2277> As long as its players smell

[4:36:30] <$cureneckbeard> forevor
[4:36:32] <$NocturneNovember> They're iditos who don't matter, so who cares what they think? LUL
[4:36:36] <+agent_epsilon> having 2 smash games at EVO is unfair to everyone else
[4:36:36] <Pookiedaexzile> Is Melee not in evo this year....finally
[4:36:36] <+Sendaar> Forever 100%
[4:36:36] <waifoong98> fuck them

[4:36:38] <aimlesshealer> oh fuck
[4:36:38] <waifoong98> LUL
[4:36:38] <majindusto> FOR-EV-ER!
[4:36:39] <dekkitout> It's legal!
[4:36:40] <KnightofNights2> until melee HD
[4:36:41] <%AncelDeLambert> they're insane, Pat, they thought their reign would never end
[4:36:41] <%GwatchaSquatcha> Yikes
[4:36:43] <%ThatGuyfromMars> yo melee is old enough to fuck
[4:36:43] <%Spydurman> Melee can vote
[4:36:44] <EddieBrock> They expected another 11 years to last.
[4:36:44] <%tweedler92> As long as they don't shower Melee lives on
[4:36:44] <%ThePuddingDead> less*
[4:36:45] <T_Sasquatch> Fuck
[4:36:47] <%Jpdodds> melees is a year younger than me
[4:36:48] <%aishman> What game now?
[4:36:51] <%PlainSimpleTailor> That game can fuck now
[4:36:52] <stiffybiro> don‚Äôt worry, melee go! is being announced tomorrow LUL LUL LUL
[4:36:52] <raveous> melee is 18 years old now, it needs to get out of Evo and get a REAL job
[4:36:53] <filialpails> melee is legal
[4:36:54] <%0dokuro> thats insane
[4:36:54] <SauceJockey> melee is now an adult
[4:36:55] <%reddpop_> 18? time for melee to go home and be a family man
[4:36:55] <%aishman> Melee?!
[4:36:57] <%TheGreatBamBe> BUT THE VIEWERS THO
[4:36:57] <waifoong98> now they can put their dick in a CD LUL
[4:36:58] <alrobot2014> melee got old enough to get kicked out of the house
[4:36:58] <stropbopadopolis> most views too
[4:36:58] <%ElenaManetta> I think they figured it had been so long, that it became a "tradition" and would be insane to remove.
[4:36:59] <starotter70> @Jpdodds same
[4:37:00] <GamerGoat007> it dies when i die :)
[4:37:03] <%bevyrage> @AngriestPat yo but did you hear that EVO is going to be giving out free water!?
[4:37:03] <%PlainSimpleTailor> off that is
[4:37:03] <+reveresao> ever shower, bad for win ratio
[4:37:05] <%supersugoisenpai1> Instead of the golden disk, we should send a copy of Melee into space
[4:37:06] <+agent_epsilon> go home and be a family guy melee
[4:37:07] <T_Sasquatch> im only 20 LUL
[4:37:07] <Pookiedaexzile> We finally did it boys....we Murdered Melee
[4:37:09] <+reveresao> never*
[4:37:13] <+sordcooper> melee is ligally allowed to fuck
[4:37:16] <%ECRead> Samsho having a spot without an official release date SUPER makes me think Skullsgirls really never had a chance
[4:37:16] <Joysta> To be fair evo will still be quite smelly
[4:37:18] <Hammerknife> well melee is at this point older than sf2 turbo so its about time its out of EVO
[4:37:19] <%GwatchaSquatcha> I guess you die today
[4:37:19] <+dramajoe> it was out by 2008. only in 2013 was it crowdfunded back in
[4:37:20] <%Ion_LaserX> Melee is old enough to go to college. THAT DAMN MILLENIAL
[4:37:24] <%reddpop_> melee FUUUUUUUUUUCKS
[4:37:25] <Dull_Fangs> I'm so glad UNIST got in
[4:37:25] <Pookiedaexzile> I'm 23, never even touched a game cube
[4:37:27] <%awsomesaucekirby> @GamerGoat007 then Iguess your'e a ghost then
[4:37:28] <SoaringLettuce> melee got meleed
[4:37:28] <LeiaSkynoober> Melee didn‚Äôt just die, it was murdered
[4:37:35] <%snow_bush> Welp, time to sleep and pretend to work...and figure out if I'm still anemic.
[4:37:36] <%moink1234> HBOX KILED MELEE
[4:37:36] <%0dokuro> oh really?
[4:37:47] <%snow_bush> noight all
[4:37:54] <Grennold> DOA6 didn't have good enough core values FeelsBadMan
[4:37:55] <ItIsSky> Where's Power Moves at Evo?
[4:37:59] <%LogothX> Let them play friendlies in the fucking parking lot with the Melty Blood people
[4:38:00] <Neo_Kaiser> DSP outlasted Melee.
[4:38:01] <%GwatchaSquatcha> So pat you think Samurai showdown is going to be good
[4:38:04] <Dull_Fangs> HD remix did tho Kappa
[4:38:05] <starotter70> The smell was coming from melee's decaying body
[4:38:13] <%tinyswampthing> st is coming back
[4:38:15] <fusioncell12> I'm gonna head out now
[4:38:16] <dekkitout> DSP will outlast the heat death
[4:38:17] <Worldbrand> LUL
[4:38:17] <EddieBrock> ST should outlast us all.
[4:38:19] <Cypher_Ranger_PhazON> No Guilty Gear, but BBtag gets Sunday instead of FighterZ.
[4:38:20] <+lethallunacyx> Alpha 3 for me
[4:38:25] <%DexteraXIII> You're right, tho
[4:38:26] <fusioncell12> Goodnight/day to everyone
[4:38:28] <Prism_Wing> Time to get MK3 back at EVO
[4:38:29] <Dull_Fangs> @Cypher_Ranger_PhazON wait what
[4:38:31] <Goldenwolf98> KI didnt last all of its updates even I think like wtf KI is amazing
[4:38:31] <Dull_Fangs> is that confirmed
[4:38:31] <SulfurousAcid> ST is still my fav
[4:38:34] <+NeonLight> If Melee HD existed and didnt require CRTs, would Melee still be played at evo?
[4:38:35] <+SuichiTanaka> SamSho getting a spot without even a release date proves that Evo is just fucked up now.
[4:38:36] <starotter70> @fusioncell12 night
[4:38:37] <%LogothX> and Brayy Bruuee crossu tag baddle
[4:38:38] <%GwatchaSquatcha> DSP will outlast everything
[4:38:39] <Sofa_King_Hype> Why is BBTag even on mainstage?
[4:38:39] <%ThePuddingDead> mvc and mvc 2 should've lasted much longer @AngriestPat

[4:38:48] <SchroedingersFerret> SOTN is the first castlevania
[4:38:51] <%GwatchaSquatcha> DSP will our last his own death
[4:38:52] <%0dokuro> I mean to others they probably saw it as both a classic fighter and a Nintendo classic
[4:38:53] <%king_of_the_skies_dom> hey woolie

[4:38:58] <waifoong98> @Sofa_King_Hype $$$ paid prob

[4:39:06] <SpaceGuntank> sup woolz
[4:39:09] <+FierceDeityGabriel> They wouldn't play it
[4:39:09] <EddieBrock> Melee HD is a myth. Come on now.
[4:39:10] <AirlineFood74> It's called ultimate
[4:39:10] <KaptainKappathe5th> if you didnt need CHEATS
[4:39:11] <%ECRead> yoooooo Woolie boys. and girls
[4:39:12] <+JustToWatch> from what I heard, DBFZ getting Saturday is more about time concerns than anything else
[4:39:16] <majindusto> WOOLRAID
[4:39:17] <%afronooch> woollieMIRIN
[4:39:17] <%TheOnlyStrayCat> HI WOOLIE! Pat is bad at flying!
[4:39:20] <Neo_Kaiser> Melee players stole CRTs from other tournaments once.
[4:39:20] <%Agami23> melee fans are gonna make a big stink at evo, i just know it.
[4:39:22] <%PaladinDupre> @AngriestPat what if they add Melee as a mode in Ultimate?
[4:39:22] <Cypher_Ranger_PhazON> It's super confirmed that BlazBlue Tag is on Sunday on the Evo website. And not FighterZ.
[4:39:22] <%Konquerer> the living dreads have arrived
[4:39:25] <%tinyswampthing> @angriestpat remember that samsho has no release date
[4:39:29] <callsigneagle01> no pat is good at flying

[4:39:36] <%aishman> Wooly raided
[4:39:36] <starotter70> Raided during the melee rant
[4:39:37] <callsigneagle01> He got the superplane sniper with a railgun
[4:39:38] <SulfurousAcid> @Agami23 melee fans always make a big stink, they don't shower
[4:39:38] <%xGreenflame> I feel like Melee died when people started to try and make rules about which glitches were okay or not and it basically boiled down to "Ban my opponents character"
[4:39:38] <%QueequegTheater> >Party of 57
[4:39:38] <twoto858> but Pat, Melee trumps viewership for almost every event it's in, Paaat
[4:39:38] <%LogothX> There's just a Woolie Raid
[4:39:41] <$cureneckbeard> yeyeye
[4:39:41] <Pookiedaexzile> So whose spot is Doa 6 taking next year
[4:39:42] <DetroitSentai> The UNIST scene earned this spot really hard, they went hard for the past two years with little major recognition until recently
[4:39:42] <waifoong98> Pat is good at crashing LUL
[4:39:44] <%ThePuddingDead> @WoolieVersus Yo what up dude!
[4:39:45] <callsigneagle01> Fly for woolie
[4:39:45] <Pookiedaexzile> I'm saying SFV
[4:39:45] <fruit_pie_the_magician> Not unless they could still use their busted ass controllers
[4:39:47] <%0dokuro> nope
[4:39:49] <%bevyrage> yo but pat talk about how EVO is providing free water

[4:39:54] <%skizzuto> don't listen to Pat he crashed a lot
[4:39:57] <%snow_bush> @WoolieVersus That is the opposite of true
[4:39:58] <%LogothX> Titanfall 2 for EVO
[4:39:58] <DarkKnightGrave> Mini Super Beast right now!
[4:40:00] <+RushUnplugged> they tried to get melee in, the smell just kept pushing other games out and they had to stop ot
[4:40:01] <Sofa_King_Hype> I was at EVO 18 and I don't think 90% of people cared about Melee.
[4:40:04] <%AncelDeLambert> he didn't Woolie, he's lying
[4:40:08] <Bustahhwulf> same 3 characters LUL
[4:40:10] <callsigneagle01> pat play multi you coward!

[4:40:19] <callsigneagle01> Play multi for the woolie!
[4:40:20] <thebakaliyen> The game is unapproachable garbage :/
[4:40:22] <Neo_Kaiser> I wish Pat ranted more about Melee.

[4:40:28] <%QueequegTheater> 1/9th
[4:40:30] <%Ion_LaserX> Guess Melee can go back to the swamp
[4:40:31] <Dull_Fangs> the thing is melee brings in a bunch of unique entrances
[4:40:34] <waifoong98> continue ranting about now everyday LUL
[4:40:34] <%ECRead> i always enjoy it, honestly

[4:40:58] <ekirbo> Leffen
[4:40:58] <Sofa_King_Hype> It was Leffen
[4:41:01] <Dull_Fangs> but I'm guessing people are happy enough Ultimiate
[4:41:02] <stabbityrabbit> @AngriestPat Melee is dead, long live Ultimate.
[4:41:03] <%Breakfast_Megapowers> Melee will live on
[4:41:03] <Dull_Fangs> swedish guy
[4:41:04] <+clausover> no that was leffen
[4:41:06] <%nmaten> no hbox has won everything for the past like 2 years
[4:41:09] <$NocturneNovember> Oh god, Pat, you need to see his spirit shatter when Hungrybox heard Melee wasn't in

[4:41:14] <majindusto> Booo Leffen
[4:41:16] <bigbradish> On leffen is awful
[4:41:16] <Taconotz> I lost my no damage run to crashing on landing in mission 19, I dont know what to do now
[4:41:16] <%ElenaManetta> apatCanada
[4:41:16] <%tinyswampthing> hbox is winnig alot now though
[4:41:19] <%TheOnlyStrayCat> Now he is ETERNAL CHAMP.
[4:41:25] <%Nobrev> leffen is a cunt
[4:41:31] <InugamiTheHound> bring back the furry fighting game "monster"
[4:41:31] <%TheSpiritof2277> that would be cool, he's our heart's winner
[4:41:36] <Pookiedaexzile> Whose not a cunt?
[4:41:46] <+Name_Meme> He had to see it coming
[4:41:47] <callsigneagle01> Nagase
[4:41:50] <stropbopadopolis> hungry killed melee its ironic
[4:41:54] <$cureneckbeard> LIQUID MELEE
[4:41:56] <Prism_Wing> @taconotz üò¢
[4:41:58] <Bustahhwulf> smash has enough exclusive tournaments who cares
[4:41:58] <Admiral_PopnFresh> Mr. Street Fighter
[4:41:59] <keymasten> I smell a rant
[4:42:00] <Sofa_King_Hype> Uncle Valle
[4:42:01] <thebakaliyen> @Taconotz Do it over :D

[4:42:07] <+PhilosoBee> atpRtsd

[4:42:26] <Dull_Fangs> damn
[4:42:29] <%ElenaManetta> 2009 was a ruff year
[4:42:30] <%n33t_1337> atpRtsd3 atpRtsd4
[4:42:36] <Taconotz> @thebakaliyen It was my last medal that wasnt the Hard or Normal S ranks. I hate that S ranking everything on Ace doesnt unlock the Hard and Normal medals
[4:42:39] <Admiral_PopnFresh> Last year, beat KnuckleDu in pools with Blanca LUL
[4:42:39] <Zantetzuken> ‚ôø
[4:42:40] <SulfurousAcid> ST da bes
[4:42:44] <%yeknomlive> also alpha series
[4:42:52] <callsigneagle01> @Taconotz Ace can vary from person to person
[4:42:52] <%tinyswampthing> he played st alpha and 3s and 4
[4:43:07] <%tinyswampthing> he still plays sf5 at evo
[4:43:08] <+dramajoe> nah alpha 3
[4:43:10] <%yeknomlive> there's footage of him playing daigo in alpha 3 when he was 18
[4:43:10] <%Superstarsage> Yeah but all hungrybox has is smash ultimate
[4:43:17] <Bustahhwulf> his mirror vs daigo was one of the best sf4 sets ever
[4:43:18] <%n33t_1337> atpRtsd1 atpRtsd2
[4:43:18] <%tinyswampthing> he did very well last year
[4:43:18] <Fujiwara_92> right? Kappa
[4:43:21] <%LogothX> Smash Ultimate feels weird to play
[4:43:25] <%Ozymandias555> @taconotz I think to encourage replays on normal difficulties like the no damage and machine gun run
[4:43:25] <Sofa_King_Hype> Valle plays SF regardless of version
[4:43:36] <Dull_Fangs> 2I lol
[4:43:38] <Dull_Fangs> also yes
[4:43:41] <%Breakfast_Megapowers> Not 3RD Strike because it sucks Kappa
[4:43:46] <%0dokuro> fair
[4:43:47] <Kamenfighter> his hugo vs bonchan's sagat was the hypest shit ever
[4:43:48] <+Xeno351> in ultimate hbox is doing a lot of commentary
[4:43:48] <%LogothX> Does Valle even play the dumpster fire of SF5?
[4:43:49] <Dull_Fangs> smash players have no prospective
[4:43:49] <%ElenaManetta> I never understand 100% when Pat talks about game community stuff but... I like to pretend I do.
[4:43:50] <%ECRead> accurate
[4:43:53] <SoaringLettuce> @taconotz i kind love that, s ranking everything on ace in zero just gets you a quote and hangar decorations
[4:43:56] <Admiral_PopnFresh> yeah, but there are 3S people like that too
[4:44:01] <Fujiwara_92> no its not Kappa
[4:44:02] <%tinyswampthing> a few melee pros play ultimate
[4:44:02] <%afronooch> same elena, same
[4:44:03] <RollCritFail> Today being that day apparently
[4:44:03] <stropbopadopolis> because it plays the best, like 3rd strike
[4:44:04] <Taconotz> It just sucks because I have the speedrun and gun only achievements unlocked on Ace but the game is making me play on hard even though I have accomplished the same thing on a higher difficulty
[4:44:05] <%AncelDeLambert> Melee fans shit on two upgrades to the series
[4:44:10] <%Ion_LaserX> The world is running low on CRTs
[4:44:12] <Grennold> Melee will rise again SwiftRage Kappa
[4:44:12] <LoveXKnife> YAY ace combat
[4:44:13] <%skizzuto> as a fan of the newer smash games, fuck the melee fans
[4:44:14] <majindusto> Cool new game....Its not Melee tho
[4:44:16] <%xGreenflame> People started modding Ultimate to be more like Melee literally a week after it released
[4:44:20] <+Shastafield> its been stale for years already
[4:44:20] <KaptainKappathe5th> fuck melee fans
[4:44:22] <%Eaglestrike117> is twitch fucking up for anyone elsew?
[4:44:22] <+RushUnplugged> it's the smelliest circlejerk

[4:44:26] <waifoong98> Smelly melee rise up Kappa
[4:44:27] <Cypher_Ranger_PhazON> There's plenty of fgc communities that are like that.
[4:44:28] <+trez_> frienlies LUL
[4:44:30] <Worldbrand> With jilly and bimmy
[4:44:30] <starotter70> Melee fans rise up
[4:44:31] <+Maids4lyfe> melee fans are insane
[4:44:32] <Fujiwara_92> ""FUNSIES""
[4:44:33] <%Starlight_Gamer> meele will still be there but in the dank backrooms
[4:44:35] <%n33t_1337> The Basement King
[4:44:35] <%Stevennapalm> fuck melee
[4:44:38] <PoopyDickens> jimmy and bimmy
[4:44:42] <%ECRead> I loooove Project M
[4:44:42] <%QueequegTheater> @AngriestPat I love Dark Souls 2 PvP but I recognize that it's mostly dead
[4:44:43] <%Reizie_Etherealm> Time has moved on for more than a DECADE while those melee enthusiasts were in their little bubble
[4:44:57] <%0dokuro> Reminds me of Overwatch fans, like hardcore fans
[4:45:00] <%themoonbear45> Will Melee replace Melty Blood as the bathroom game?
[4:45:00] <majindusto> BIMMY and JIMMY
[4:45:07] <%ElenaManetta> smash is smash is smash
[4:45:10] <%ElenaManetta> pat smash
[4:45:12] <+arcturusblade> FWIW, Ultimate is actually doing a much better job of attracting Melee players than Brawl or 4 ever did
[4:45:14] <stropbopadopolis> sakurai hates melee because he couldnt top it
[4:45:22] <%AngriestAngryArtist> SF is all different with each iteration
[4:45:22] <%shockzndrawe> You mean Nintendo?
[4:45:28] <%AngriestAngryArtist> can't argue that LOL
[4:45:29] <SulfurousAcid> I think you meant to say Nintendo not capcom
[4:45:29] <PoopyDickens> meelee
[4:45:31] <%Agami23> melee is a shitty glitchfest
[4:45:35] <Worldbrand> Is it that Ultimate doing that, or is that just the ceaseless grinding of time?
[4:45:35] <+MordenPrime> nintendo just put project M on the switch, charge 30 bucks, literally free money
[4:45:38] <%n33t_1337> It's gonna get smellier
[4:45:41] <Taconotz> I think a big part of the decision was the cost of getting all those CRTs in the building
[4:45:47] <waifoong98> Smash turn into an actual smelly Orgy Kappa
[4:45:47] <starotter70> You need the 'right' controller
[4:45:49] <DesuDesuDokiDoki> the smell is getting stronger
[4:45:49] <%Stevennapalm> broken controllers?
[4:45:51] <%0dokuro> waiting on game pass
[4:45:51] <Taconotz> So does this mean I should sell my melee copy now or wait?\
[4:45:52] <+FierceDeityGabriel> And broken controllers
[4:45:52] <Tucker0603> you mean melee
[4:45:54] <thebakaliyen> when your game has such a steep learning curve that literally no one new makes it to high tier tourneys that is a bad thing
[4:45:58] <%shockzndrawe> Melee tourneys in bathrooms like Melty Blood let's go
[4:45:59] <%Starlight_Gamer> fuck those controllers
[4:46:01] <%n33t_1337> CRT will eventually become an endangered species
[4:46:01] <%Ion_LaserX> CRTs are becoming extinct
[4:46:07] <%SilvaChariot0133> Just Raid Super Potato Kappa
[4:46:07] <KaptainKappathe5th> you need the controller to be broken in the right way so you can fucking cheat
[4:46:08] <%TheSpiritof2277> Give us one more broken controller rant please
[4:46:09] <+Shastafield> LUL
[4:46:11] <Admiral_PopnFresh> I'm hording my 3, they are in storage
[4:46:11] <a_mad_dragon> and you need those SPECIAL controllers
[4:46:13] <GamerGoat007> me
[4:46:15] <%n33t_1337> CRTs will become the SSR of this world
[4:46:16] <RollCritFail> @shockzndrawe I was literally thinking the same thing
[4:46:17] <count_bob> I saw a CRT on the side of the road today.
[4:46:17] <%ThatGuyfromMars> and copies of Melee are getting more expensive to get too
[4:46:17] <%themoonbear45> Time for Melty Melee
[4:46:18] <%Graywolf_the_45th> Aren't they making more for Ultimate
[4:46:19] <lordreginald> Not having GGxrd on the main stage is sadder to me tbh
[4:46:20] <$Hommando> Melty Blood will rise
[4:46:20] <$cureneckbeard> Gamecube controllers are unbreakable though
[4:46:21] <%Superstarsage> Oh yeah, totally it was always going to die. but for those invested in it

[4:46:26] <%Reizie_Etherealm> They're gonna die out for sure
[4:46:26] <Sofa_King_Hype> Maintaining that shit is ridiculous. CRTs being a requirement for a tournament in 2019 is dumb.
[4:46:29] <callsigneagle01> Gamecube rise up!
[4:46:29] <Grennold> Evo 2075, playing Melee on the world's last functioning Gamecube Kappa
[4:46:30] <lemon_lore> port?
[4:46:33] <KaptainKappathe5th> i cant wait for melee do physically fucking die
[4:46:34] <%tinyswampthing> there are companies that make gc controllers @AngriestPat
[4:46:35] <$MagickBurritoh> But melee is the pinnacle of human achievement
[4:46:36] <%tweedler92> They keep making new Gamecube controllers for every nintendo console LUL
[4:46:37] <SoaringLettuce> and you NEED those one in fifty special controllers
[4:46:37] <%Ozymandias555> Nintendo literally made new batches of gamecube controllers for Smash 4 tho

[4:48:13] <majindusto> Melee doesn't have K Rool...Therefore it is Trash!
[4:48:17] <KaptainKappathe5th> melee IS dead
[4:48:19] <InugamiTheHound> remember according to pat "melee players are babies"
[4:48:23] <Cypher_Ranger_PhazON> Getting the CRT's was also a hassle awsell.
[4:48:28] <Pookiedaexzile> MElee is dead
[4:48:30] <%ElenaManetta> Getting into any kind of competitive gaming at all just seems like a gigantic gamble. It's constant stress, the skill level and gap is immense and game rotations are practically constant. I don't know what the benefit is to even getting into it.
[4:48:33] <%Breakfast_Megapowers> Melee has more than enough to survive outside of EVO
[4:48:33] <starotter70> I love Melee for nostalgic reasons, otherwise its pretty alright
[4:48:36] <Sofa_King_Hype> That was 2012 @AngriestPat
[4:48:37] <%0dokuro> just today?
[4:48:37] <TheBlankAce> Well we'll now find out

[5:00:18] <Pookiedaexzile> I can't wait
[5:00:20] <+Greenkap> melee is for piss babies
[5:00:22] <+Shastafield> NotLikeThis
[5:00:22] <%ElenaManetta> no, you're on time, pat hasn't started the game yet
[5:00:23] <joylent_blue> i believe it
[5:00:24] <%kiiiirsten> @SrG00SE Hi goose you missed the funsies
[5:00:24] <laguerrilha> Babies
[5:00:25] <Grennold> Melee drones LuL
[5:00:25] <waifoong98> DansGame
[5:00:28] <lloyddboy> REMOVE MELEE
[5:00:28] <KaptainKappathe5th> theyre called pissbabies
[5:00:30] <CeeDee__> it would not be unprecedented
[5:00:30] <+pkmamsters> Not "boo" per se.. but chanting "MELEE"
[5:00:31] <starotter70> or everything
[5:00:32] <Prism_Wing> or shoot
[5:00:32] <SeventyForce> It's too real STAWPEETTT
[5:00:33] <majindusto> So many Pissbabies
[5:00:34] <callsigneagle01> Melee NPCs
[5:00:35] <%yeknomlive> it could happen
[5:00:36] <+Ell1ot> wait... but if humans are litter, then how do humans get into heaven?
[5:00:37] <thebakaliyen> so many fans of Melee and only like 5 that matter
[5:00:39] <Grennold> All the known Melee players should be pre-emptively banned just cos 4Head
[5:00:40] <%Reizie_Etherealm> I dunno chat, I feel like Ace Combat 5 is more of a glass break than to be on the list of game to play right now.
[5:00:40] <Neo_Kaiser> It will really stink
[5:00:42] <InugamiTheHound> shiro from voltron?
[5:00:42] <%anusholeboner> Reggie was keeping the Melee scene alive for Hbox, Bowser bribed EVO to close the scene
[5:00:42] <joylent_blue> remember when they boo'd Bayo
[5:00:47] <%8inchepinch> That's fuckin sad
[5:00:48] <+zetaplus> I'd imagine they're going to enter unist chat and ruin it for everyone
[5:00:50] <%Reizie_Etherealm> Yeaaahh
[5:00:50] <CurrySauseBandit> So I never got why Pat hates melee players.
[5:00:54] <ArtThouBored> Well just force everyone to take showers to keep them away
[5:00:54] <PoopyDickens> ü¶Ä MELEE IS DEAD ü¶Ä

[5:01:00] <callsigneagle01> @Reizie_Etherealm I like the big 3 but 7 is right behind them
[5:01:00] <LeonSteel> or samsho
[5:01:01] <JittersCaffeine> @kyuubisonic You think so? I didn't have many problems with it. Although I get the feeling that there will be some non-stealth fans who will be very mad that stealth is almost required to get the good ending
[5:01:06] <joylent_blue> cut from the same cloth üò°
[5:01:06] <CurrySauseBandit> That was the Smash 4 crowd booing Bayo.
[5:01:07] <waifoong98> oh noooo
[5:01:09] <+pkmamsters> smash 4 crowd, which are the same i guess
[5:01:09] <%SilvaChariot0133> LUL
[5:01:12] <callsigneagle01> I can HEAR the caution
[5:01:14] <redsynod> I hope they protest
[5:01:14] <callsigneagle01> GODIT
[5:01:14] <%0dokuro> once you understand melee is dead its just dead
[5:01:15] <laguerrilha> Remember how the Bayo players also acted like babies?
[5:01:16] <%Ion_LaserX> LUL
[5:01:17] <%TheSpiritof2277> GOTIT
[5:01:18] <ArtThouBored> Bay deserved it for being cancer I hear
[5:01:18] <Pookiedaexzile> @Ell1ot You have to kill the human liter too.....but leave no pieces so they don't soil the ground
[5:01:18] <%ElenaManetta> i love hearing you on your own stream

[5:02:08] <+kyuubisonic> @JittersCaffeine Oh dont misunderstand, I really liked it but its just jank. And the voice acting is very hit or miss. Still the best single player fps in a while
[5:02:09] <%kiiiirsten> big stretch

[5:02:37] <%Mystery_Syringe_Hobo> Always remember #energydrugs
[5:02:41] <CurrySauseBandit> @pkmamsters Smash 4 by the end of it's cycle was agreed by most people to have ended with a pile of shit meta LUL Of course they'd move to ultimate, it's a better Smash 4
[5:02:50] <lloyddboy> REM LEZAR NO
[5:02:57] <GVGguy> Did you fly planes good?
[5:03:19] <JittersCaffeine> @kyuubisonic I like Metro's version of Little Lamplight better than Fallout 3. It made more sense to me.

[5:11:23] <TheBlankAce> I hope the mind control drugs from the detective pikachu game is in the movie

[5:11:30] <Arweynn> the HUMAN is the tampered one, its why he can understand poke-speak
[5:11:34] <%TheSpiritof2277> it's just Demo but without the Scottish charm
[5:11:35] <%QueequegTheater> WHAT
[5:11:36] <%Graywolf_the_45th> why the fuck did they use that name
[5:11:37] <Worldbrand> What?! it's not assault horizon?!
[5:11:37] <cerberuscarmine> hes also a copy of pip from paladins
[5:11:38] <callsigneagle01> that had Beast Squadron
[5:11:41] <T_Sasquatch> i cant wait to see him fuck the entire cast of overwatch
[5:11:42] <%GeneralSCPatton> This man can't even remember the bit about how many clones he would need to kill a gorilla. That conversation was pure gold and he still forgot.
[5:11:42] <+blueflame910> Why are you up at 1:01 am. I am writing a Dawson paper right now
[5:11:45] <%QueequegTheater> IT'S A REMAKE OF 2
[5:11:46] <callsigneagle01> and Lancer Squadron
[5:11:49] <%McSnazzyPants> yeah it's weird they named it assault horizon
[5:11:49] <Halospaz117> It has nothing to do with assault horizon, the name is so stupid
[5:11:50] <%goose_attack_almanac> @AngriestPat The messed up duck that looks like living suffering is Ludicolo. It's the Tequila Gundam of Pokemon. Aipom is the gremlin lookin monkey with a hand tail
[5:11:50] <%ThatGuyfromMars> 3d is the worst of the series
[5:11:54] <%ThatGuyfromMars> no I lied
[5:11:55] <Prism_Wing> DDD has great controls
[5:11:56] <%McSnazzyPants> but no it's just ace combat 2 rewritten to be in strangereal
[5:11:57] <Halospaz117> And yeah it's AC2
[5:11:59] <@Moobot> Whoa I don't even shout that much! (@Reizie_Etherealm)
[5:12:00] <%QueequegTheater> Why didn't I know about this
[5:12:03] <callsigneagle01> Ace Combat 2 is good itself
[5:12:06] <%0dokuro> on a ds?
[5:12:08] <JittersCaffeine> @kyuubisonic I think my interpretation was that he felt like he failed the kids and couldn't handle it. I got the impression that the Teacher was already a depressive person prior to the group getting stranded in the forest.
[5:12:08] <%QueequegTheater> RIP @Reizie_Etherealm
[5:12:09] <callsigneagle01> Fucken ZOE
[5:12:10] <joylent_blue> ?????? DDD was good, but not that good
[5:12:11] <%ThatGuyfromMars> Coded is the worst KH game, but 3D has a bad story
[5:12:12] <%0dokuro> hm
[5:12:15] <%McSnazzyPants> hey, ace combat x wa son the fucking psp
[5:12:19] <Worldbrand> Holy shit he's right what the fuck
[5:12:20] <Valdorick> Oh yeah, its the one true Assault Horizon, we don't speak of the other one.

[5:13:09] <%Mystery_Syringe_Hobo> I am dead inside so I feel nothing
[5:13:10] <%QueequegTheater> Dogs are innocent, people are not
[5:13:10] <Caidezes> Snuff that pup.

[5:13:12] <cerberuscarmine> XD
[5:13:12] <ArtThouBored> Or Big Boss die from old age
[5:13:13] <joylent_blue> its because dogs are ALWAYS innocent, unless they're resident evil dogs

[5:13:22] <Prism_Wing> I feel nothing for dogs
[5:13:23] <%Konquerer> but people LIKE dogs
[5:13:23] <Rexwarrior1> dogs more like hogs
[5:13:24] <%Ion_LaserX> I can empathize with a dog. Not a bunch of ones and zeroes
[5:13:24] <Worldbrand> Also true
[5:13:26] <ArtThouBored> Ideally
[5:13:26] <+ArcanumMBD> no fuck that dogs more important

[5:13:36] <ArtThouBored> Realistically? I love steak
[5:13:37] <+Mvrdok_> @AngriestPat That is because we don't care about people Kappa
[5:13:38] <%TempestaDePrimo> yo the dialga and palkia statues are lgreat
[5:13:38] <xmetalicdemonx> Humans are trash and dogs are pure.
[5:13:39] <darcfowler1995> Fuck other humans
[5:13:40] <callsigneagle01> God India and Pakistan are actually executing air war
[5:13:40] <alrobot2014> nah the dog is innocent, the guy with the spine was gonna do the same to me
[5:13:44] <starotter70> He's great
[5:13:44] <KaliasTV> If you found mortal kombat going on in your living room you'd probably be a bit more affected
[5:13:45] <callsigneagle01> man shit's getting fucked up
[5:13:48] <JetpackMcQuack> What if it‚Äôs a cardboard cut out of a dog that died years ago?
[5:13:52] <T_Sasquatch> Youre used to seeing violence against people in every form of media, you rarely ever see or hear animals being abused
[5:13:52] <%Starlight_Gamer> yeah
[5:13:52] <callsigneagle01> o dear
[5:14:00] <%QueequegTheater> @AngriestPat Did you see the video of a dog crying while watching Mufasa's death?
[5:14:05] <%ThatGuyfromMars> man I heard that as prostitutor. I'm tired
[5:14:08] <Worldbrand> she's a fucking villain
[5:14:16] <+kyuubisonic> @JittersCaffeine He might've known about all the radiation piling up in the dam, so maybe he felt like wasn't worth it to lead the kids out after a certain point.
