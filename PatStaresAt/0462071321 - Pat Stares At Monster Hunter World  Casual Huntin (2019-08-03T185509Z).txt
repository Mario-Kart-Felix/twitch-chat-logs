[0:22:25] <+Intolerable> 1 bit , 1 penny

[0:22:51] <%Kingkaiju0618> @angriestpat wait so twitch charges more than what you guys get?? I'm only donating now then

[0:23:54] <+solomonpun> Also the risk of chargebacks is mitigated with twitch, i'd guess.
[0:23:56] <%ElenaManetta> converted cash
[0:23:57] <wheeely> chargebacks also matter for paypal donations
[0:24:00] <%arcaderabbit48> Fucking hell, I don't want to have to ask an accountant what the most monetarily sound way to donate to some angry ginger is.

[0:25:15] <%arcaderabbit48> @AngriestPat Just ask people to send you blank checks! Im pretty sure that's not illegal. Maybe.
[0:25:21] <%augusm> Everyone steals from everyone
[0:25:24] <AMajorTom> Just save it all up in a pile and hand over a non-descipt briefcase at a convention.

[0:25:36] <$valriot> It's that just how Epic Game Store works?
[0:25:39] <seraphinapanda> working at amazon taught me that putting mail in mailboxes when you're not the actual mailman is a federal crime with a fine of 5k ameribucks

[0:35:19] <thunderborn32> @KiraKamixephos his lightning hits in the shape of a compass so stay out of cardinal and diagonal spaces from behemoth, when mounted on him dont spam attack too fast and finish the mount stay on his back as long as possible because he doesn't do crazy bullshit when your mounted; the meteor part is just get good unfortunately, other then those his physicals and fireballs should be easy to dodge
[0:35:19] <brambobelurkin> Behemoth isnt too bad just some of his hit boxes are absurdly huge

[0:39:00] <+LastHazzerd> makes sense, flashy
[0:39:02] <+TridentBerryBurst> I think the black crystal is on Netflix. You can definitely buy a copy off of Amazon

[0:39:16] <%Kirby_Sauce> Cheer500 I'm sorry my darlings, but while i attempted to get from fresh start to HR WITHOUT CHEATING last night by not sleeping, my tiredness bested me. And then I spent the rest of this morning watching castlevania with my sandwich friend. So I can't join pat on his quest to huge. Maybe i can get to HR while he plays in background though.
[0:39:18] <spiegspikel> That headgear is awful. I love it.
[0:39:30] <%0dokuro> BiG AtTaCK
[0:39:35] <%FrustratedAF> castlevania is worth it, kirb
[0:39:38] <brambobelurkin> btw Lance can parry the tzitzi flash so it simplifies that quest
[0:39:39] <Hotmemes420> new unist

[0:39:47] <Hotmemes420> ***
[0:39:48] <lilo52> @angriestpat do you have any interest in playing Freedom Wars
[0:39:50] <%AncelDeLambert> and he chooses the LONGEST route
[0:39:58] <danknugglit> Drachen is amazing
[0:40:00] <%arcaderabbit48> How grindy is Monster Hunter World? I beat the main game, and then locked up when I saw the massive equipment list and was asked to kill a palette swap of a thing I'd already killed like 10 times
[0:40:02] <%FrustratedAF> crit bounties?
[0:40:14] <%AncelDeLambert> I crib off of other people's investigations, much easier
[0:40:15] <%FrustratedAF> radobaan's a lil bitch
[0:40:17] <brambobelurkin> Drachen is the best hands down. Only a few Gammas replace parts in it
[0:40:17] <%0dokuro> Vaal
[0:40:18] <+Superstartee> what am i looking at lmao, im like wow that sword is ridiculous then i see this big wiggly loch ness head

[0:40:44] <%0dokuro> Skelly time
[0:40:46] <%AncelDeLambert> Show Paige radobaan, make her love him
[0:40:47] <+Skyebaker> love his design
[0:40:48] <+Grayhammatter> paige would like radobaan
[0:40:51] <%FrustratedAF> radobaan is adorable, but WAY MORE FUN TO BULLY

[0:40:54] <skylar_koen> vaal hazak set is made for edgelords and I love it.
[0:41:00] <thunderborn32> paige would love rado cause hes a skeleton ball
[0:41:09] <%0dokuro> Embrace the Edge
[0:41:13] <%AncelDeLambert> @SuperFineButtHairs he's got dope armor, yeah. Shame the skills suck
[0:41:13] <brambobelurkin> You missed the Gala suit
[0:41:17] <+Grayhammatter> summer fucking whatever
[0:41:19] <+zanzibar_junker> kulve gear is p useful too
[0:41:21] <brambobelurkin> layered Gala suit is dope as fuck
[0:41:22] <+Vex831> @arcaderabbit48 MH is a big grind, but only if you want to. The way world works is you can set your own boundaries and goals that mostly attribute to optimization. But almost every skill worth a damn is easily accessible through armor sets and charms

[0:43:15] <%arcaderabbit48> @haveswordmuststing Hunting itself is super fun, and the main game is pretty good about giving you new things. But then post game hits and hye, its poison birb again. Now fight a dragon, but its pink this time. Wanna fight the bomber plane monster? Well, better piece his trail together over multiple different unrelated hunts.

[0:47:44] <%logoth_> Tonfas
[0:47:47] <+Vex831> switch axe gets so much better in ceborne
[0:47:47] <+dasmause> monster hunter stream? whats the occasion
[0:47:51] <%Tennochief> and magnet spike
[0:47:53] <+TunakIn> the hunting dootdoot
[0:47:53] <brambobelurkin> Been using Lance since Monster Hunter 2004 and never looked back. best weapon
[0:47:56] <%Tennochief> ADD MAGNET SPIKE ALREADY
[0:47:58] <%FrustratedAF> can't wait for World 2 tho
[0:48:00] <SuperFineButtHairs> do it one more time
[0:48:03] <flyingtarantulaz> march 2020
[0:48:03] <+Grayhammatter> wait, there's a take all button?
[0:48:05] <SuperFineButtHairs> You need 2
[0:48:06] <%arcaderabbit48> Bows have been a lot of fun for me
[0:48:10] <%Fenrirlives> GUNLANCE BEST
[0:48:12] <Krothar> DiootDoot Making your party better Doot
[0:48:12] <+desfore> Magnet Spike is a frontier weapon. THey don't count
[0:48:12] <ovan20> Lance is just a worst gun lance, fight me Kappa
[0:48:18] <Theoyveyman> RIP maximum might
[0:48:19] <%FrustratedAF> gl boys Kreygasm
[0:48:22] <Tomschiii> i wonder if underwater battles will ever come back. i hope so
[0:48:24] <%Estuko> @brambobelurkin I've recently started using lance as a tanky build, it's pretty damn cool with huge shields.
[0:48:25] <+Vex831> @Grayhammatter PC only
[0:48:25] <deviljhojho94> Ayyyy
[0:48:27] <%Masutasodo> Magnet spike is so COOL THOUGH
[0:48:31] <haveswordmuststing> i assume march since that JP fiscal year ends around march-april
[0:48:32] <%Tennochief> Well they should be in the main games
[0:48:32] <thunderborn32> why do people main a weapon type at all, i find that theres a best weapon for every job
[0:48:40] <brambobelurkin> @ovan20 Lets see you mount a monster with you minute long cool downs and reload times
[0:48:46] <%0dokuro> Cause your damage is too bright
[0:48:47] <SuperFineButtHairs> do it oussy5
[0:48:51] <+Grayhammatter> aw yeah, now you can be an asshole who doesn't have a wiggler hat
[0:48:55] <+dasmause> @thunderborn32 i learned that the hard way when taking longblade against kirin
[0:48:56] <+SlashHabit> Hi pat <3
[0:49:00] <Tomschiii> @thunderborn32 skill makes every monster the same
[0:49:04] <%SinisterWang> Cool guy
[0:49:07] <spinalwizard> never change
[0:49:11] <%HiroTSK5> Every Hunter's Dream to get the fan designed Weapon
[0:49:11] <SuperFineButtHairs> B)
[0:49:17] <+KoyaMusa> too much hair
[0:49:18] <+TheImmortal70> Because the best weapon probably isn't the best when against different monsters so you need different types of the same weapon
[0:49:20] <YungxFisher> B)
[0:49:22] <%arcaderabbit48> @thunderborn32 That's true, but that also requires farming and crafting multiple weapons and sets. Which is a daunting idea for some
[0:49:26] <%starotter70> What if you named Red XIII: Big Puss?
[0:49:27] <%Tennochief> they better add in the fist gun lance
[0:49:28] <frozenottsel> But the "a crap guide" hat is really cool
[0:49:32] <skylar_koen> @thunderborn32 honestly I think it's because most peeps don't wanna farm gems or bs item drops for all the weapons
[0:49:34] <+desfore> People main weapons cause it's easier/more comfortable to just specialize one way. I go DB and HH, but it needs drastically different armor sets to maiximize efficiency
[0:49:35] <Theoyveyman> NSFW incoming
[0:49:35] <%0dokuro> Not enough Wiggler
[0:49:37] <%arancet> i cant imagine why
[0:49:39] <SuperFineButtHairs> just go bald
[0:49:39] <%FrustratedAF> red XIII is Baseball
[0:49:46] <brambobelurkin> @Estuko I abuse the parry system with it. Its super useful with guard up and guard 3 though. Can stand in a AT Kulve lava pool with no problems
[0:49:47] <thunderborn32> so people dont want to farm in a game about farming
[0:49:51] <SuperFineButtHairs> yes
[0:49:57] <haveswordmuststing> im hoping they add a new weapon for funsies, like big dumb hulk fists to lariet and suplex monsters with
[0:50:07] <ittla> i wanna see behemoth
[0:50:07] <+nsidious1> pistolSuh
[0:50:09] <danknugglit> New hairstyles n beards coming
[0:50:10] <%Estuko> @brambobelurkin hella guard skills is super handy, practically making out with super novas LUL
[0:50:13] <+ComradePenguin> gotta solo leshen!
[0:50:16] <%FrustratedAF> Blood and Bone
[0:50:18] <+ComradePenguin> its the only way
[0:50:18] <%arcaderabbit48> @thunderborn32 I came here to kill new monsters, not kill the same monster 20 times
[0:50:18] <+SlashHabit> So, what do you do in this game?
[0:50:21] <SuperFineButtHairs> do great jagras
[0:50:23] <+Vex831> I finally got my shield jewel after 1100 hours. Very happy
[0:50:23] <+KingZaffy> "Flesh Cleaved to the Bone" has Radobaan
[0:50:26] <%Estuko> @SlashHabit hunt monsters
[0:50:28] <%FrustratedAF> there's an event with radobaan and odoggo
[0:50:28] <Darthkitten_Prime> What's with the element icons on the protraits? Some kind of mod?
[0:50:30] <+desfore> When did they add elemental icons to the monster pics????
[0:50:34] <ChuckMagnus> Investigations?
[0:50:36] <+SlashHabit> @estuko oh
[0:50:45] <%AncelDeLambert> @AngriestPat Is that a mod that shows the monster weakness on the mission screen?
[0:50:47] <+Grayhammatter> odo and a rado
[0:50:47] <Theoyveyman> @angriestpat what's with the element icons next to monsters?
[0:50:49] <KosOrSomeSayKosm_> yay doggo
[0:50:50] <%Estuko> @SlashHabit kinda.. in the name lol
[0:50:53] <%0dokuro> Odogaron best blood dog
[0:50:53] <Kavizimo> @desfore mod
[0:50:57] <+Grayhammatter> could always investigate
[0:50:59] <%Nobrev> @desfore he has some mods installed
[0:51:01] <+SlashHabit> @estuko ;p
[0:51:01] <SuperFineButtHairs> Clifford
[0:51:03] <+desfore> oh
[0:51:04] <%Tennochief> nice
[0:51:05] <%FrustratedAF> when's Greatest Dodogama apatGib
[0:51:11] <%AncelDeLambert> time for me to get that mod
[0:51:15] <brambobelurkin> @Estuko this man gets it. Odogg lance with Drachen gear is crit central. 75% without Max might with 2 slots of max might 95% and weakness exploit. I usually go full offensive with it.
[0:51:16] <Daniel_Is_I> Element only REALLY matters for DBs and Bow
[0:51:23] <%Estuko> I love the PC version, lets me transmog outfits
[0:51:25] <Darthkitten_Prime> Raw's getting nerfed in iceborne though, probably for the best.
[0:51:26] <%AncelDeLambert> the item light mod is NECESSARY
[0:51:28] <YungxFisher> how do u install mods>
[0:51:30] <YungxFisher> ?
[0:51:30] <Tomschiii> is there a way to get the progression from the console to the pc? (without getting banned or so)
[0:51:33] <KosOrSomeSayKosm_> you don't have the transmog mod?
[0:51:35] <%Tennochief> transmog is the best mod ever
[0:51:41] <%Tennochief> and Gatomiu is a godsend
[0:51:53] <%Tennochief> so many MH$ and other armor changes
[0:51:54] <%Estuko> @brambobelurkin wo* but I have twin swords for my full offensive lol, I love trying so many different stuffs
[0:51:55] <shinichizio> Just cheat 4Head
[0:52:12] <+MetalMeltdown31> Capcom doesn't give a flip about hacking and modding. You can rebuild your character in mod tools.
[0:52:13] <%Bailey__gaming> hey pat early for youu isnt it?
[0:52:16] <ItsAGundamu> Hatsune Miku Character Mod with a baseball bat is the best mod
[0:52:20] <haveswordmuststing> i believe Special K is used for mods, it at least is for Tales of Berseria so i could fix that damn outfit
[0:52:26] <+Grayhammatter> conti please
[0:52:28] <%Estuko> odogoron is a sexy beast
[0:52:29] <%starotter70> Fight Fight Fight!
[0:52:30] <%0dokuro> Kill'em blood dog!!!
[0:52:33] <+SlashHabit> So is the game over when you find the monster?
[0:52:38] <%QUOTE_ME_IF_HE_DOES_IT> odogaron best boy
[0:52:40] <+Grayhammatter> holy shit, rado got fucked
[0:52:44] <%Piemen99> blood dog is the best monster
[0:52:46] <%FrustratedAF> bruh we're getting a dragon odoggo in iceborne
[0:52:46] <%dekkitout> If your build recommends more than 3 attack gems, you have to cheat
[0:52:49] <%arcaderabbit48> Okay, this seems really cruel. You stuck two monsters that hate each other in a pit, surrounded by weapons designed to kill them in horrible ways
[0:52:51] <deviljhojho94> whiffmaster
[0:53:10] <Tomschiii> alrighty then, if i dont have to worry about getting banned, i can consider buying the pc version
[0:53:11] <%Estuko> @SlashHabit there's variations to the hunting types and monsters. environments, abilities they wield, etc
[0:53:13] <+Grayhammatter> and an electric dinosaur
[0:53:17] <haveswordmuststing> @arcaderabbit48 [Digital Sports]
[0:53:21] <%FrustratedAF> another mod the PC people want to grab is those little pillars of light that poke up from material drops
[0:53:24] <SuperFineButtHairs> You can get 3 for free, it's possible to get 1 more that most builds use
[0:53:25] <%Estuko> @Tomschiii yeah, if anything as long as you don't mess with other players if I recall.
[0:53:29] <%GarbageNirvana> No one said monster hunters were nice
[0:53:34] <%Estuko> @FrustratedAF oh god oh fuck, pillars of light Kreygasm
[0:53:37] <%starotter70> @arcaderabbit48 pat IS a fan of bloodsports
[0:53:39] <Theoyveyman> CORAL PUKEI & VIPER KIDACHI THOUGH
[0:53:41] <thunderborn32> @arcaderabbit48 overpopulation is why you hunt them in the first place; so if its really a problem to you then you must hate how america produces its food
[0:53:43] <skylar_koen> acidic glavenous is gonna be the worst and best to fight
[0:53:52] <+SlashHabit> @estuko The game should be called "Monster Killer"
[0:53:57] <brambobelurkin> @Estuko I switch it up too, but I would be a lair if I didnt say I was biased towards Lance. I use pretty much everything, I just dont like hammer much in World. I dont know why just feels much slower than it used to.
[0:53:57] <+Grayhammatter> poison tobi is super fucking cool
[0:53:58] <%Tennochief> I ope they add in Rajang
[0:53:58] <%dekkitout> *Cries in Defense Down*
[0:54:00] <+Grayhammatter> OH
[0:54:01] <%0dokuro> welp
[0:54:04] <%Estuko> @SlashHabit you can capture them instead of killing.
[0:54:06] <Hydrapissed> Cant wait for thunder nerg
[0:54:07] <%FrustratedAF> iceborne is gonna be fucking crazy and i need it in my veins
[0:54:08] <%Dovakhin573> You think Rodo is getting a new subspecies?
[0:54:10] <Tomschiii> @Estuko ah, got it. i just dont want to farm eveything again so thats good^^
[0:54:18] <MrCheesyFondue> "you think you're doing moves but you're not"
[0:54:26] <+SlashHabit> @estuko Im drunk so please ignore any troll comments from me here on out
[0:54:26] <+dasmause> is greatsword the black mage of monster hunter?
[0:54:26] <+Grayhammatter> rado is basically subspecies uragan
[0:54:29] <%Estuko> @brambobelurkin could never grab hammer tbh, I did fall in love with switch axe/gunlance though. I'm a dumb bitch for big booms
[0:54:29] <%arcaderabbit48> Why can we not carve the tail off after it dies? Are the monsters like lobsters where their bodies dissolve the instant they die?
[0:54:30] <%DinoBear_7> Poison snake squirrel is a good boi
[0:54:34] <spinbel> The dude's unrionically baguette sticking.
[0:54:38] <SuperFineButtHairs> rip
[0:54:42] <Darthkitten_Prime> It does
[0:54:44] <squibble> oh it does
[0:54:44] <Hydrapissed> it will
[0:54:44] <%FrustratedAF> monster hunter GS is for the big number people who like huge damage
[0:54:45] <%0dokuro> Its the best
[0:54:45] <haveswordmuststing> @arcaderabbit48 they do
[0:54:47] <%Dovakhin573> it does
[0:54:48] <TsunTsuchinoko> they already showed it
[0:54:48] <danknugglit> It does
[0:54:48] <%dekkitout> It's weeb af
[0:54:49] <Hydrapissed> will it be good though prob not
[0:54:50] <@commanderclaw> They already showed it
[0:54:51] <Theoyveyman> Rado is uragaan but cooler
[0:54:52] <%cvp5127> be a big ninja
[0:54:52] <Skeletonmanners> they showed it off pat its got a straw hat
[0:54:54] <+MetalMeltdown31> They posted concept art with it, and it does look very dope.
[0:54:54] <SuperFineButtHairs> it'll be odo armor that's black
[0:54:55] <+Vex831> I think it's just a black version of the master rank odo
[0:54:55] <+dasmause> i liked odogaron set when it showcased hips
[0:54:55] <thunderborn32> @arcaderabbit48 some monster EAT their tail
[0:54:55] <LazyLudens> @SlashHabit you don't have to kill them necessarily, you can capture too
[0:54:55] <+allups> best boi is dodogama
[0:54:56] <+kubozuka27> Its super edgelord its beautiful
[0:54:56] <%Freelance7> It is dope
[0:54:56] <Tomschiii> i love the female mask of it (not sure if male has the same one)
[0:54:56] <%starotter70> get up in dem guts
[0:54:57] <%AncelDeLambert> The Odogaron set is so cool, and is such CRAP
[0:54:58] <%GarbageNirvana> The sense I've always gotten from the MH series was that it's a very "us or them" kind of world, like if hunters didn't do their thing Regine would be dead
[0:54:58] <+dasmause> not the new one
[0:54:58] <brambobelurkin> @Estuko thats alright. We ALL are dumb bitches for big booms
[0:54:59] <%Estuko> @Tomschiii you can edit your stuff, I did it since I went through ps4 already. I just transferred a single set of mine via edits.
[0:54:59] <Darthkitten_Prime> Oh, okay
[0:55:00] <+Verd_254> wake me when they do more layered armor
[0:55:02] <Hydrapissed> it wont
[0:55:02] <%0dokuro> The weapons are great
[0:55:05] <%arcaderabbit48> @haveswordmuststing Fair enough!
[0:55:07] <%FrustratedAF> the odoggo armor got leaked somewhere i think
[0:55:16] <brambobelurkin> Its DOPE AS FUCK
[0:55:17] <%Estuko> @SlashHabit oh, ok
[0:55:18] <%FrustratedAF> LAYERS

[0:55:56] <%Estuko> they saw the transmog mod and went HM GOOD IDEA
[0:56:09] <%FrustratedAF> we still haven't actually seen explody slime boy, right?

[0:56:33] <thunderborn32> my luck itll take elder dragon gems
[0:56:35] <Tomschiii> @Estuko i am not very knowledgeable about the whole cheating/modding stuff. should i just get something out of nexusmods or is it a little bit more complex?

[0:58:09] <%Kirby_Sauce> Cheer500 so paige, I am being forced to rescind my rescinding of your weird skeleton thing, because I recently listened to a podcast episode in which a book by an "ian Watson, author of the screen story for steve spelborg's aaaaayyyy" was discussed, and that frankly normalised your whole thing.
[0:58:10] <+TunakIn> a fulgur bug flying by probabl
[0:58:14] <+mobius_won> His howl is very distinct
[0:58:14] <brambobelurkin> See electricity. Get Hype. Lagicarus
[0:58:14] <haveswordmuststing> Gore Magala really shouldve been used as a trailer for the PC version
[0:58:14] <+Theworld732> The longsword tree was shown and people think yian Garuga might be in the game
[0:58:14] <$joylent_blue> my god this will be a slaughter

[0:58:19] <paulblartmarlkarx> why does everyone like zinogre so much he looks so dumb lol
[0:58:19] <ShinTeach> gore and rajang need their own neat update like jho and luna had
[0:58:21] <+Trenr> I would pick this game up again for Gore
[0:58:22] <Archmortal> I need Gore. And for Gore's High Rank set appearance to be the G rank set appearance
[0:58:23] <%Kirby_Sauce> Is paige still there?

[0:58:40] <%FrustratedAF> @Estuko there's some speculation about dalama, but its just speculation
[0:58:41] <brambobelurkin> NO
[0:58:42] <+Mailboy> no
[0:58:43] <brambobelurkin> STOP
[0:58:45] <sonofthedeepsouth> So capcom is actually putting beloved monster of older games in world. What does that tell about gamefreak

[0:59:00] <Skeletonmanners> unique monster replaced with a recolor lol
[0:59:00] <deviljhojho94> Nothing compares to rajang
[0:59:03] <%FrustratedAF> wasn't rajang the monkey?
[0:59:04] <%Estuko> man, that golden rajang set for the females in mh4u was super sexy :(
[0:59:05] <%Tennochief> I want my monkey
[0:59:06] <haveswordmuststing> they put Goku's model from budokai 3 in as Rajang
[0:59:07] <$joylent_blue> oh my god
[0:59:07] <squibble> if they put gore magala in would they also put in shagaru magala?
[0:59:09] <Archmortal> @sonofthedeepsouth Gamefreak's problem is that they're 20 years behind in game development standard practices
[0:59:09] <+Grayhammatter> that rado is dead
[0:59:10] <+Mushinronja> don't think fulgur anja excludes rajang at all
[0:59:12] <%Agami23> i just want the hermitaurs
[0:59:13] <$valriot> Rajang was a dumb PS2 relic from a game that genuinely wasn't good
[0:59:14] <%FrustratedAF> rajang for world 2
[0:59:15] <%starotter70> 4Head
[0:59:22] <malesin_01> if rajang was in they'd have shown blangonga by now

[0:59:58] <sonofthedeepsouth> MAKE PAT PLAY STARSECTOR
[0:59:59] <%bakiinthedemon> Man was just chillin in his house minding his own business
[1:00:03] <+MetalMeltdown31> @seraphinapanda Yeah, just do investigations. It can show up as a box reward.

[1:00:14] <Krothar> Rajang already in DBZF like 8 times tho
[1:00:16] <%arcaderabbit48> First time I fought Radoban with my bow, I just happened to have the exact coatings to completely neuter him. Made that fight a lot easier than it would have been otherwise, the spiky\ bitch.
[1:00:20] <%starotter70> "I love him"
[1:00:23] <+Grayhammatter> everyone is goku
[1:00:24] <seraphinapanda> ok cool, cuz all im good at is hammer. thanks guys
[1:00:25] <%Tennochief> There's a Rajang armor mod on the Nexus
[1:00:27] <brambobelurkin> @valriot you mean the two game that set up this whole genre of game? The two games that set bars for their release time?
[1:00:33] <%FrustratedAF> hammer is good fun

[1:01:10] <+Grayhammatter> seregios fighting a rath, that would be awesome
[1:01:10] <%GarbageNirvana> oops all sharpness
[1:01:11] <%sshen> Considering yian garuga is the love child of kutku and rathian, does this mean anjanath mated with a tobi?
[1:01:12] <brambobelurkin> Seregios LBG PLEASE
[1:01:18] <$valriot> What about Khezu, @angriestpat ? Kappa Kappa
[1:01:20] <brambobelurkin> dodge relaods were so cash

[1:02:07] <$joylent_blue> momhun

[1:02:09] <%GarbageNirvana> Give me my Sentai armor
[1:02:10] <sonofthedeepsouth> This world invented jet engines before proper cartography let that sink in
[1:02:11] <$joylent_blue> momster hunter

[1:02:36] <%FrustratedAF> i hear rumors there's a world mod where you can dress poogie up as dodogama, the fattest of blue boys
[1:02:42] <%Estuko> the khezu set in mhf2 was really cool
[1:02:42] <Tomschiii> @ShinTeach wohoho buddy boy, underwater is love
[1:02:43] <%Tennochief> yes
[1:02:43] <tetriata> Giggi needs to come back. Khezu needs to stay in the trash

[1:03:04] <+Super_General_Guy> Bring back Forest Lagiacrus with horrible Tri Wii visibility
[1:03:07] <Tomschiii> gigi in tri with the torch was great. i loved the usage of the torch
[1:03:12] <haveswordmuststing> Gypseros should come back so Capcom can make new ways for it to lie, steal, and cheat in game
[1:03:12] <Archmortal> Saved Color palettes only save temporarily
[1:03:17] <haveswordmuststing> Kappa
[1:03:17] <thunderborn32> @TyrantBelial mhw specifically needs more smaller monsters that are a real threat, rather then just a learning step
[1:03:18] <$joylent_blue> the color saving system doesn't work the way you want it to
[1:03:21] <%arcaderabbit48> Make it blurple
[1:03:22] <+Grayhammatter> ivory lagi though
[1:03:28] <%Tennochief> @FrustratedAF ***
[1:03:31] <Archmortal> like until you exit the menu temporary

[1:04:08] <zangetsu_114> It is complete and global saturation tho pat
[1:04:08] <+RedDeadApple> Chameleos would also be a nice return for Elder dragons
[1:04:09] <Krothar> Rip no food
[1:04:09] <pepegrillo3> most of the technology that thet hunters use is from a old civilization that was destroyed by fatalis

[1:06:32] <CybertronPrime> Vaal Hazak isn't undead, it's just covered in rotten flesh.
[1:06:33] <%FrustratedAF> beat the absolute fuck out of his face
[1:06:41] <thunderborn32> @ShinTeach i would shit myself if iceborne's secret guest was dalamadur
[1:06:42] <Tomschiii> @Estuko with durabiltiy and how they are in your inventory. elitists are defending every litlle thing
[1:06:44] <%FrustratedAF> stinky boy has stinky skin
[1:06:45] <LeonSteel> this is tempered val or normal?
[1:06:57] <+Grayhammatter> that incredibly stinky skin
[1:07:00] <%Estuko> @Tomschiii I liked not having to worry about pickaxes, lol.
[1:07:02] <%FrustratedAF> pretty sure its normal vaal
[1:07:04] <Nina96> oh god insect glaive... NotLikeThis
[1:07:08] <%Dovakhin573> So how much of a monster would a Healthy Valhazak be?
[1:07:12] <+Zxtole> MHGU is still tons of fun, they give you so much stuff online too
[1:07:22] <%FrustratedAF> going from gunlance to insect glaive was a whole new game
[1:07:22] <%Nobrev> justinian king of the skies over here
[1:07:25] <%arcaderabbit48> Really thought this guy had sick zombie powers, but whatever. armor of rotten flesh is good too
[1:07:27] <Kavizimo> Arch tempered Vaal is potion drinking simulator
[1:07:30] <%Ninestempest> is there a code for pat's room?
[1:07:31] <SonicD4> GS sucks
[1:07:34] <IBeastmanNinjaI1> MHGU has a ton of stuff to do, it's pretty insane with the number of monsters and missions
[1:07:39] <Tomschiii> @Estuko ofc, thats just so much better, like most QoL changes in world^^
[1:07:47] <+Grayhammatter> giant pickle dick
[1:07:56] <+RedDeadApple> not saying mhgu was bad but i preferred mh4u
[1:07:59] <%zenraider> Are you gonna go after Kulve taroth?
[1:08:00] <%Estuko> @arcaderabbit48 he spreads his miasma that infects other monsters, then he steals it from everyone. more like a necromancer style lol
[1:08:04] <%Masutasodo> Man, I love Vaal's theme Kreygasm
[1:08:05] <%FrustratedAF> BlessRNG hope there's a jho variant
[1:08:05] <%radda343> he needs that goo it's important
[1:08:07] <%furiousfurioso> zombie dragon stripGo
[1:08:09] <%GarbageNirvana> Isn't Vaal basically just a corpse
[1:08:14] <%HiroTSK5> I think the Gunk is Vaal though?
[1:08:15] <+Trenr> I love Val
[1:08:16] <+DZiffer> Vaal will never be a prom queen
[1:08:16] <thunderborn32> @arcaderabbit48 well its not his flesh to be fair
[1:08:17] <42nfl19> @AngriestPat whats the best starting weapon for beginners?
[1:08:19] <+Mushinronja> just need to get health augment
[1:08:22] <Nina96> i love it
[1:08:22] <danknugglit> Isnt that skin?
[1:08:22] <+Yosepmeist> AT Vaal?
[1:08:24] <%Ninestempest> vaal is covered in corpses
[1:08:26] <ChuckMagnus> I think there's concept art of him without the rotten flesh.
[1:08:26] <%FrustratedAF> vaal would look cute if he'd smile
[1:08:29] <startstoprepeat> you can turn it off if you break his chest
[1:08:30] <+Trenr> Val was my first endgame set
[1:08:34] <%dekkitout> Same reason I hate Luna
[1:08:34] <Kalcom> how's sns on ice
[1:08:35] <%Estuko> So, @chat which of you degenerates has that one specific Vaal Hazaak mod for the armour Kappa <3
[1:08:36] <TyrantBelial> No throw out more dots
[1:08:38] <+slambranflakes> noooo
[1:08:40] <Nina96> long sword
[1:08:42] <twoto858> longsword?
[1:08:43] <+Super_General_Guy> Real men use Hammers
[1:08:45] <%Agami23> i love vaal's aesthethic but hate vaal
[1:08:45] <%Masutasodo> Long sword is super easy
[1:08:46] <+Grayhammatter> but i love swaxe
[1:08:47] <%Verd_254> the one you find fun
[1:08:49] <%Freelance7> I started with longsword
[1:08:49] <+Zxtole> Long Sword is ez mode too
[1:08:50] <Tomschiii> i hope they get better themes for monsters in iceborne because none of the track in world are memorable at all
[1:08:50] <Zebroneath> This be regular, tempered, or arch-tempered?
[1:08:52] <%Ninestempest> long sword is this game's dragoon
[1:08:52] <Kavizimo> hammer is very good to learn positioning
[1:08:54] <Skeletonmanners> longsword is good for begginers
[1:08:56] <+Grayhammatter> swaxe is so cool too
[1:08:56] <QuestionableDes> Long Sword is great for starters too
[1:08:57] <Axle13j> that was satisfying
[1:08:59] <%FrustratedAF> constant fuckin health drain from his stinky body
[1:09:01] <malesin_01> savage deviljho will probably be in iceborne
[1:09:01] <%arcaderabbit48> Hammer is also really good as a beginner heavy weapon, in my experience
[1:09:02] <Nina96> regular
[1:09:03] <+RedDeadApple> lance is pretty good for beginners
[1:09:05] <+Mailboy> greatsword is freat for beginners
[1:09:05] <%Ninestempest> LS is fun for beginners but a good way to cart
[1:09:05] <+Yosepmeist> Boom Lance Boyzzz!!!
[1:09:06] <otaku9392> why not insect glave
[1:09:08] <KiraKamixephos> Those are the funnest ones tho
[1:09:08] <+greenmoose11915> im a new player. i picked longsword. i loved it. i just killed devil jho and vaal hazak today about an hour ago
[1:09:12] <Deadbulky> Telling new players to use SnS LUL
[1:09:13] <+allups> i started with insect and now main switcheaxe
[1:09:18] <%FrustratedAF> GL did me fine as a beginner
[1:09:23] <+TheImmortal70> SnS is dope
[1:09:24] <+Mailboy> greatsword forces new players to respect the monstars
[1:09:31] <Kavizimo> SnS being a beginner weapon is the biggest lie ever told
[1:09:34] <%dekkitout> I'd go back to CB if I had rocksteady
[1:09:37] <+kubozuka27> Hammer and Longsword were the first weapons I learned how to master back in Tri
[1:09:37] <+Grayhammatter> respect the monstars
[1:09:42] <Tomschiii> i still remember the theme of white fatalis, ukanlos etc. in wolld? nothing at all
[1:09:46] <Krothar> LS is all about staggering allies tho
[1:09:49] <%Fenrirlives> Gunlance is great for beginners because everyone should play it!
[1:09:50] <%Ninestempest> in fact pretty much the only weapon i don't rec for beginners is CB
[1:09:51] <+RedDeadApple> Chargeblade give you a good experience too
[1:09:52] <%Verd_254> my nephew went straight to insect glaive first time playing. honestly just dick around training till something feels good
[1:09:56] <%Ninestempest> everything else works pretty well
[1:09:58] <%Estuko> @Krothar being fucking tripped NotLikeThis
[1:10:05] <%0dokuro> Button mash
[1:10:09] <thunderborn32> @Mailboy how does GS force you to respect monsters you just shoulder tackle through all their hits and do stupid damage
[1:10:11] <+MetalMeltdown31> SnS works as a beginner weapon since it has a low skill floor, while also having a huge skill ceiling.
[1:10:12] <%Tennochief> I kept on missing with CB when I started
[1:10:14] <Daniel_Is_I> I'd say IG is way easier than LS
[1:10:18] <+Grayhammatter> pat likes the big number
[1:10:18] <Kalcom> just try all weapons
[1:10:19] <Theoyveyman> has pat suffered through ancient leshen yet
[1:10:19] <Axonn1018> Yeah World has a pretty weak OST save for a few
[1:10:21] <%Ninestempest> i love SNS in this game
[1:10:23] <+Trenr> I play great sword because I have the biggest dick
[1:10:23] <shinichizio> I used Dual Blades because I am a weeb and I like being able to dodge out of everything. Kappa
[1:10:24] <%Agami23> greatsword is the grappler of monster hunter
[1:10:25] <Krothar> @Estuko Hated grouping with LS users for the longest time.
[1:10:25] <%radda343> I prefer more stabs than harder stabs
[1:10:26] <%Ninestempest> all the aerial options are super fun
[1:10:28] <+mobius_won> Unless u miss
[1:10:31] <%FrustratedAF> hammer's big fun
[1:10:38] <+Mailboy> well thunder that is something most new players are not going to know how to do
[1:10:39] <%0dokuro> Spin to Win
[1:10:39] <NDenizen> IG is best for Je Suis Monte
[1:10:42] <Hydrapissed> so pat gana do all the hard monsters?
[1:10:43] <%Dovakhin573> I cant believe LS is getting JUDGEMENT CUT in iceborne Kappa
[1:10:46] <+RedDeadApple> ancient leshen atpCarl
[1:10:48] <%0dokuro> Hammer is fun
[1:10:48] <+Trenr> oof

[1:10:57] <LeonSteel> F
[1:10:57] <+Yosepmeist> I think it is good to focus on weaps that don't have intricate movesets when starting out. learn a simple weapon, learn the monsters, then branch out

[1:11:18] <+Trenr> haha, time to get one shot now
[1:11:18] <Sanyle> easy mode has been unlocked
[1:11:19] <NDenizen> dying to non-tempered Vaal
[1:11:25] <+Yosepmeist> AT system is garbo
[1:11:26] <%Nikopol1717> Tempered sucks
[1:11:29] <%Ninestempest> imagine dying to regular elders
[1:11:30] <%FrustratedAF> pat's rusty Kappa
[1:11:35] <Nina96> its g rank without the new armor
[1:11:37] <%0dokuro> Possibly
[1:11:38] <%GarbageNirvana> It's not like it even gives em new stuff, it's just the same fight but they can instakill you now
[1:11:39] <+Mushinronja> It's the weakest of endgames, put together quickly
[1:11:41] <%Ninestempest> is pat just
[1:11:44] <%Ninestempest> not gonna max his HP
[1:11:48] <+Grayhammatter> dying to regular elders? you scrub
[1:11:56] <%Ninestempest> lol
[1:12:00] <+Trenr> least favorite elder?
[1:12:03] <%Ninestempest> damn all those bounties at once
[1:12:05] <+Snirtax> Arch tempered is absolutely terrible as a system. It just makes the fights ten times more tedious
[1:12:09] <Theoyveyman> I CAN'T WAIT FOR ACIDIC GLAVENOUS TO GET MORE POWER
[1:12:10] <%starotter70> No Deaths!
[1:12:15] <%Ninestempest> NEED GLAV YEAH
[1:12:23] <Nina96> tail?
[1:12:24] <%0dokuro> Whos the fuck who got the gem!

[1:12:36] <%arcaderabbit48> Thickle?
[1:12:36] <+Yosepmeist> I don't mind regular tempered mons but AT is bad
[1:12:38] <%Dovakhin573> I rather have freinzied monsters over tempered
[1:12:38] <thunderborn32> @Ninestempest no point on rebuffing mid mission, its ideal to just not die in the first place
[1:12:38] <+Snirtax> AT gets like one new move per monster and they're all absolute cancer
[1:12:41] <Nina96> TAIL PAT
[1:12:44] <startstoprepeat> the arch tempered monsters who get new moves and traits are cool af, it's just that soem of them only get bigger numbers
[1:12:44] <+Grayhammatter> tail
[1:12:45] <%dekkitout> AT is why I refuse to put down max guard up/wide gun lance
[1:12:46] <%0dokuro> Tail?
[1:12:52] <skylar_koen> oh my God his weapons are gonna be big erect
[1:12:53] <%0dokuro> Yeet

[1:12:55] <+gunslinger_xxiv> Debuffs your bones
[1:13:00] <%Ninestempest> @thunderborn32 I suppose if it was already limping, sure
[1:13:01] <+Snirtax> That nergigante superman slam is the worst thing they've ever added
[1:13:01] <%FrustratedAF> galv looks like a paige monster
[1:13:03] <+Grayhammatter> that fucking jump... looks SO good
[1:13:03] <BootyFriend> The debuff is lowered defense
[1:13:05] <+TunakIn> time for bbehemoth extreme
[1:13:06] <%FrustratedAF> big strong and tough huge
[1:13:08] <Rare_SK> Am I screwed if I try to get back into MHW? I stopped playing May 2018
[1:13:08] <@JustinianKnight> yea we got tail
[1:13:09] <Nina96> gave me a heart attack
[1:13:09] <%Ninestempest> but i always go all in and i have a good supply of pots
[1:13:10] <+shivhappy22> 600 hundred hrs in and i still dont have the patiience to fight extreme behemoth
[1:13:13] <Tomschiii> i never used anything related to guard with my GL. evasion is the best
[1:13:16] <weontheultralightbeam> monkaS

[1:13:35] <Kavizimo> Just eat adamant seeds
[1:13:41] <+Grayhammatter> more slime!
[1:13:41] <$monkeyhous3> ITS SLIME TIME
[1:13:45] <ittla> It sucks that elder dragon sets in this game are mostly only good for fighting the elder dragon you got them from
[1:13:46] <Theoyveyman> when you do acidic glavenous do him with the Dante set for the full experience
[1:13:49] <+Grayhammatter> it's slime time
[1:13:52] <Nina96> is it called slime again?
[1:13:55] <%Estuko> don't you hate it when you're huntign with your friend and his slime weapons gets all in your mouth
[1:13:59] <%Ninestempest> wtf that was every weekly at once??

[1:20:03] <frozenottsel> so much pink!
[1:20:04] <ChuckMagnus> For temporal?
[1:20:05] <EuropanLamprey> If you're not aiming for hideous, you're doing it wrong
[1:20:05] <+Grayhammatter> that is PINK, TOO pink
[1:20:07] <%starotter70> Beautiful
[1:20:11] <%CappuccinoGuil> Isn't that an FF14 armor?
[1:20:12] <+KaosMachina> You just don't _APPRECIATE_ IT
[1:20:21] <%FrustratedAF> chuck, pat said he has temporal already so idk
[1:20:24] <Nina96> its really bad
[1:20:24] <+Tokanova> its a sad game

[1:20:33] <BlueLunecy> You attack with the goddamn joystick
[1:20:36] <%arcaderabbit48> @CappuccinoGuil Drachen Armor, from 14. You get it form the Behemoth hunt
[1:20:36] <%FrustratedAF> some games age like shit
[1:20:36] <%GarbageNirvana> Attacks for Greatsword were relegated to the right thumbstick in the first MH
[1:20:37] <Skeletonmanners> because attacking with the second stick lol
[1:20:38] <%GarbageNirvana> Think about that
[1:20:38] <Archmortal> Imagine if your weapon's moveset was based on Right Stick directional inputs
[1:20:41] <ShinTeach> played the fuck outta MH1, can confirm

[1:20:49] <%CappuccinoGuil> @arcaderabbit48 dope
[1:20:52] <tiger_joe> imagine attacking with the right stick LUL
[1:20:55] <Archmortal> and camera control was not on the right stick
[1:21:00] <Vigonept> Theyre giving balding options and better beards in iceborn
[1:21:00] <+Pixel_Matt> Welcome to a crap guide to Monster Hunter
[1:21:01] <EuropanLamprey> Big Wiggler, not compensating for anything
[1:21:01] <+KaosMachina> TAKIN' DRUGS
[1:21:03] <Theoyveyman> imagine AT Lunastra without a farcaster
[1:21:03] <%FrustratedAF> look at the first smash bros compared to ultimate, first iterations of a franchise don't age well
[1:21:05] <%AncelDeLambert> Just lost the TLN quest, someone carted.
[1:21:07] <+IxDomxI> it might've been a terrible game but goddamn did i love that terrible game
[1:21:08] <Nina96> can u make the head a different color? cause black looks dead inside @AngriestPat
[1:21:09] <+Grayhammatter> pouring that drug into your neck
[1:21:11] <%AncelDeLambert> FUCK Luna and Teo, fuck them so hard
[1:21:14] <%starotter70> Did you have to click the right stick or move it?
[1:21:21] <PhoneyPhoenix> Yo, @AngriestPat do you have multiple sets of armour or do you just run one set all the time?
[1:21:22] <shinichizio> Move and click
[1:21:23] <%FrustratedAF> note: please don't fuck elder dragons
[1:21:23] <%arcaderabbit48> @CappuccinoGuil FF14 also has a boss fight against Rathalos, one of the mascot monsters of Monster Hunter
[1:21:26] <guts32> Team Silent was going to make Silent Hill 5 which was going to be similar to Silent Hill 2 but konami canned it and gave it to the western team and Silent HIll homecoming was born :(
[1:21:28] <Archmortal> Also the end-game of the original MH was online-only. On PS2
[1:21:29] <$joylent_blue> fighting them on the dunes is SUPER fun with hammer

[1:23:02] <NDenizen> technically true but also weird
[1:23:04] <%arcaderabbit48> @Tomschiii Base fight is fun and has some coold monster hunter mechanics, but isn't too hard. Savage form is a bit more challenging, mostly because your entire team can only be knocked out a few times before you instantly fail
[1:23:04] <%AncelDeLambert> HAHA
[1:23:11] <Nina96> tail
[1:23:14] <otaku9392> its lega

[1:23:41] <%Ninestempest> i dont understand
[1:23:44] <%AncelDeLambert> the thing I think I hate the most about Teo is how he randomly aggros the team

[1:23:55] <Theoyveyman> 1000 dragons is the most hype name for a basic bow move
[1:23:56] <$monkeyhous3> Lunastra is even worse
[1:23:56] <KingVantq> @guts32 rev?
[1:23:57] <NDenizen> Nothing in this game is worse than Kushala
[1:23:58] <+Grayhammatter> oh fuck
[1:23:59] <ittla> this looks awful
[1:24:03] <Nina96> damn it missed
[1:24:04] <%AncelDeLambert> by
[1:24:06] <+Trenr> Teo is fucking terrible
[1:24:06] <%FrustratedAF> does woolie's [Bring Me to Life] affect [Crazy Talk]?
[1:24:08] <$joylent_blue> Teostras not great, but Lunastra is unfun
[1:24:08] <guts32> @KingVantq yea the rev lmao
[1:24:12] <ittla> i couldnt imagine trying to run this fight on my pc
[1:24:18] <Tomschiii> @arcaderabbit48 well, i am too much of a bitch to do extreme or savage things so i wont do sav. rathalos either^^
[1:24:20] <Schuhart> [Break Stuff]
[1:24:22] <weontheultralightbeam> I would like Lunastra more if I could actually see shit
[1:24:25] <+KoyaMusa> but elmo is the baby
[1:24:25] <guts32> @KingVantq when your reving while in charge position
[1:24:26] <$D4C_Trice> teostra is dead easy Pat but lunastra is a fuck
[1:24:27] <egggggggggggggggggggggg> Teostra gets eaten out by insect glaive
[1:24:27] <%FrustratedAF> 10 seconds to cart Kappa
[1:24:27] <+Yosepmeist> a lot of the elder dragons are just annoying
[1:24:28] <%arcaderabbit48> Did they just bang mid-fight and it caused an explosion? A literal bang?
[1:24:30] <%GarbageNirvana> I wonder how this game would run on my PS4 Pro actually
[1:24:39] <%AncelDeLambert> they make the arena impossible to fight in, they don't maintain aggro, they have blastblight
[1:24:41] <%GarbageNirvana> Like if I keep it at 1080 would I get 60fps or
[1:24:41] <Nina96> teo is just an add when luna is around
[1:24:44] <ittla> teostra was enough to give me some freezes
[1:24:44] <%AncelDeLambert> fuck Teo
[1:24:46] <+thedannydarko> Man this game looks good in 60FPS, I'm stuck on Xbone cause friends
[1:24:53] <%Agami23> lunastra is prety bad in general
[1:24:55] <ittla> both of these fuckers would probably fry my cpu
[1:25:01] <thunderborn32> could you imagine if belly flopping make you immune to damge in real life?
[1:25:07] <Theoyveyman> toaster & loaf
[1:25:11] <%arcaderabbit48> @Tomschiii Same, most of the time. It'd be different if I could find a static group to play with, but leaving the more complex mechanics of Savage to a random team is not fun.
[1:25:11] <%FrustratedAF> REALLY?
[1:25:12] <GMKGoat> Toaster is EZ tho
[1:25:19] <+mobius_won> He‚Äôs not that bad lol
[1:25:19] <%Freelance7> I love Teostra
[1:25:19] <$D4C_Trice> why do you hate teostra?
[1:25:19] <ittla> this game's update content is really disappointing outside of behemoth
[1:25:20] <+P1nkHat> y tho
[1:25:21] <Greywolf47> lvl 140 teo Kappa
[1:25:22] <%Freelance7> His theme is great
[1:25:23] <+Trenr> 2nd worst. Fish boi worst boi.
[1:25:23] <$monkeyhous3> he's not so bad
[1:25:24] <zeif00> not Lunastra?
[1:25:25] <$Sdeje> Arch tempered Gigginox
[1:25:25] <%goose_attack_almanac> He's a big dumb manticore
[1:25:25] <NDenizen> Teostra is the easiest of the bunch besides Nerg
[1:25:26] <TyrantBelial> Is it because he's GigaElmo?
[1:25:28] <+RedDeadApple> teo is easy if you bring flashes and a dragon weapon
[1:25:32] <KiraKamixephos> He‚Äôs pretty ez
[1:25:36] <ittla> but i only like behemoth because i like ff14
[1:25:37] <malesin_01> they made him better in world atleast
[1:25:39] <KiraKamixephos> Luna tho hggOkay
[1:25:39] <+Yosepmeist> Luna is way worse than Teo
[1:25:41] <LeonSteel> i hate kushala more than teostra
[1:25:41] <%arcaderabbit48> So when does the weird cthulhu octopus get added?
[1:25:42] <guts32> So apart from this one is Monster Hunter Tri good?
[1:25:44] <Daniel_Is_I> "Hey let's make Kirin a major endgame monster!" "But DBs can't hit Kirin's head..." "WHAT WAS THAT!?"
[1:25:46] <weontheultralightbeam> Kulve was good
[1:25:47] <Axonn1018> Fuck Kushala
[1:25:50] <Nina96> it was great
[1:25:50] <+zanzibar_junker> fight at nergi
[1:25:51] <Tomschiii> @arcaderabbit48 the problem is not the group or the randoms but me. i am exactly one of those people you would hate :D
[1:25:53] <%FrustratedAF> kulve is okay at best
[1:26:05] <+Grayhammatter> kulve is alright
[1:26:06] <%Freelance7> I love Kulve
[1:26:09] <%GarbageNirvana> Well they kept giving us the G versions of everything before this
[1:26:10] <%Kirby_Sauce> Cheer500 pat is teostra, because red and angry. Paige is lunastra because big and strong.
[1:26:10] <Axonn1018> Time lock events were a bad idea though
[1:26:12] <Tomschiii> and i am a tank which makes it worse
[1:26:12] <Vigonept> arch xeno is fun
[1:26:13] <$monkeyhous3> lol nope
[1:26:17] <%GarbageNirvana> So we were conditioned to blow through content
[1:26:18] <+RedDeadApple> kulve is a fun fight
[1:26:19] <%starotter70> Nice
[1:26:20] <ittla> i didnt even bother with tempered because i was already satisfied by the time i unlocked them
[1:26:22] <EuropanLamprey> ! DENIED !
[1:26:23] <%Nobrev> what why
[1:26:25] <NDenizen> Kulve Taroth is the coolest fight
[1:26:26] <Archmortal> Event quests only became permanent with Tri/3U isn't it? They rotated like this before then. But before then the games weren't great so
[1:26:27] <+Yosepmeist> Suck?
[1:26:27] <%VanaSkiller> weapon gacha
[1:26:30] <+Grayhammatter> boomstick PogChamp
[1:26:31] <Greywolf47> kulve is a boring grind to me
[1:26:34] <$D4C_Trice> ...
[1:26:35] <+Trenr> that sounds awful
[1:26:35] <$monkeyhous3> the main set is pretty good
[1:26:37] <+Yosepmeist> KT weaps are some of the best in the game
[1:26:38] <%Tennochief> KT is a classy bitch
[1:26:43] <+MetalMeltdown31> The Kulve fight is fun, but the RNG on her weapons is horse shit.
[1:26:43] <weontheultralightbeam> LUL
[1:26:45] <$joylent_blue> thanks bomb idiot
[1:26:45] <%AncelDeLambert> "sucks" apatCrazyhand apatCrazyhead
[1:26:46] <+Grayhammatter> LUL
[1:26:46] <zeif00> a handful are super good tho
[1:26:46] <Vigonept> pats wrong yet again
[1:26:47] <shinichizio> bonk
[1:26:47] <+demon1103> Kulve is one of my fav hunts...her loot game is just bad tho
[1:26:47] <+mobius_won> Best in slot tho
[1:26:49] <%FrustratedAF> kulve weapons are good, but that grind is fucking obnoxious
[1:26:50] <%Ninestempest> LUL
[1:26:51] <NDenizen> The AT Kulve weapons are silvery-gold and they look pretty great
[1:26:52] <%Freelance7> One of my favorite switch axes is a Kulve weapon
[1:26:53] <ittla> i dont want to burn out on these monsters before the expansion comes out. tempered seems like a good way of ruining the fights in this game
[1:26:57] <%AncelDeLambert> KT's weapons are the strongest in the game
[1:26:58] <%arcaderabbit48> @Tomschiii Lol, oh no! Well honestly, being able to admit it already puts you way ahead of a bunch of people I've been paired with.
[1:26:59] <Nina96> KT is super fun to fight to me
[1:27:02] <+gunslinger_xxiv> Gold gun skins lumpytJon
[1:27:03] <$D4C_Trice> KT has the best weapons in the game
[1:27:05] <+Grayhammatter> yikes
[1:27:09] <guts32> Aren't the enemies just walking hitboxes here?
[1:27:09] <$monkeyhous3> KT has some of the best weapon in the game, it's just a pain to get them
[1:27:12] <%FrustratedAF> luna weapons are GOAT tho
[1:27:17] <%VanaSkiller> Lunasty
[1:27:19] <+RedDeadApple> Luna is just not fun at all
[1:27:20] <%AncelDeLambert> ATKT has some very pretty weapons
[1:27:21] <%arcaderabbit48> Lunastra? More like Lunasty!
[1:27:22] <AngrySpaceLlama51> I hate that some of the best weapons are from kt it‚Äôs the worst part of the game by far
[1:27:28] <+desfore> "worst weapons" tell that to my DB ass....
[1:27:30] <+MetalMeltdown31> KT doesn't actually have the best Greatsword, which Pat already has so he can slip KT if he only wants to GS.
[1:27:34] <%FrustratedAF> lunasstra, more like tee-grex
[1:27:37] <Archmortal> @ittla Tempered yes. Arch-tempered have new attacks and behaviors though. That said don't bother with AT Zorah, it's just shit.
[1:27:40] <Vigonept> have you fought any of the arch tempereds pat?
[1:27:41] <thunderborn32> getting a good weapon from KT is like praying for a god tier riven mod
[1:27:41] <+MetalMeltdown31> skip*
[1:27:46] <yukichocomilk> with insect glaive these 2 are so easy, but otherwise i hate them LUL
[1:27:51] <Greywolf47> temper luna and normal luna don't feel that different they both hit me hard.
[1:27:52] <%GarbageNirvana> If only you could use the dodge style from Generations
[1:27:52] <+Yosepmeist> KT is the only way to get a LV4 Wide shell GL
[1:28:04] <%arcaderabbit48> So much fire
[1:28:05] <%RupanSen> Normally I don't like golden weapons/armor either but I love the Saint Seiya gold cloths for some reason
[1:28:05] <+MetalMeltdown31> Arch Tempered KT has much better weapon RNG, but it's still not great.
[1:28:05] <+Zxtole> Insect glaive counters so many monsters lol
[1:28:12] <+Grayhammatter> luma is very pretty though
[1:28:12] <$D4C_Trice> @ittla AT zorah has great armour
[1:28:14] <%Kirby_Sauce> You can bully the shit out of kushala with queen's rose
[1:28:18] <%arcaderabbit48> Trying to turn the desert sand in to glass
[1:28:19] <%AncelDeLambert> THIS is way Luna is the worst monster. You can't even fight her without near-carting
[1:28:22] <%sshen> Pats doing his best black mage impression and standing in all the AOE markers
[1:28:25] <Greywolf47> cool drinks help the aoe fire BS
[1:28:29] <Nina96> remember pat do not flash @AngriestPat
[1:28:32] <+zanzibar_junker> lunastra is a cakewalk compared to at kushala
[1:28:39] <$joylent_blue> LUL
[1:28:43] <%Kirby_Sauce> Just smack her out of the air with the shield
[1:28:43] <+Grayhammatter> LUL
[1:28:43] <NDenizen> LUL
[1:28:45] <%Tennochief> how d you not know that?
[1:28:45] <%arcaderabbit48> This shit is why I like bow. Gotta have that range
[1:28:46] <+zanzibar_junker> constant wind aura
[1:28:48] <$joylent_blue> the charge headbutt is the fucking worst
[1:28:49] <%FrustratedAF> Jebaited
[1:28:50] <+desfore> LUL LUL LUL LUL
[1:28:51] <%GarbageNirvana> I mean...they probably don't help that
[1:28:51] <Kavizimo> Bow pellets are still making sound LUL
[1:28:54] <Daniel_Is_I> I hate every single one of these "aura" elder dragons and I despise that they became the endgame of World.
[1:29:02] <+Yosepmeist> Kush is ezpz
[1:29:03] <+mobius_won> AT kushala is some ripe bullshit at the end
[1:29:05] <Tomschiii> @arcaderabbit48 new raids, dungeions etc. make my tank anxiety just burst, meaning that i am very crappy. ^^ i had the luck to not meet such people yet so yeah
[1:29:11] <%AncelDeLambert> at least mantles help some. Not ENOUGH, but some.
[1:29:13] <NDenizen> AT Kushala is genuinely the worst thing ever
[1:29:24] <%Tennochief> Kushala is a cunt
[1:29:28] <Nina96> lunas armor super good though
[1:29:30] <%FrustratedAF> AT kushala will infinite fuckin cyclones littering around
[1:29:31] <+mobius_won> He‚Äôs a cakewalk til the final area tho
[1:29:32] <Daniel_Is_I> AT Kushala is a big middle finger to dual blades lol
[1:29:33] <%AncelDeLambert> Kushala is nothing with ranged weapons
[1:29:33] <+Yosepmeist> Kush is so easy to stunlock
[1:29:37] <%Tearonex> she's really not that bad
[1:29:38] <%Tennochief> fuck those constant tornados
[1:29:40] <Greywolf47> also water weapons and pods help control luna's fire
[1:29:41] <$joylent_blue> the more i think of the endgame in this the more angry i'm getting
[1:29:42] <+MetalMeltdown31> AT Kushala is extremely easy if you bring a ranged weapon/gunlance, and a real issue if you don't.
[1:29:43] <KingVantq> AT Kushala, Val, and Luna can fuck off
[1:29:43] <%Freelance7> She isn't that bad
[1:29:44] <LeonSteel> kushala and lunastra are the worst
[1:29:46] <Vigonept> Behemoths the end though
[1:29:47] <ItsAGundamu> Lunastra is the worst monster i've ever fought
[1:29:50] <Vigonept> and hes rad
[1:29:51] <ItsAGundamu> Its such a bad fight
[1:29:51] <%sshen> So pat are you looking forward to oroshi kirin?
[1:29:51] <+RedDeadApple> Yeah upside to luna her armor is Fucking amazing
[1:29:57] <ittla> hard or not, the fight sucks
[1:30:01] <NDenizen> Luna is perfectly manageable if you actually build against her
[1:30:02] <+zanzibar_junker> I luv exbehemoth
[1:30:04] <%arcaderabbit48> @Tomschiii Oh, I absolutely feel you there. I do have Dark Knight up to 70, but I'm super hesitant to do any Shadowbringers stuff on it even though I already beat the whole expansion as a healer.
[1:30:05] <Kavizimo> AT nerg is the end
[1:30:06] <+MetalMeltdown31> The real end now is AT Nergigante.
[1:30:12] <brambobelurkin> Fight is genuinely not fun
[1:30:22] <+Mailboy> she is really the only challenge in this game tbh
[1:30:23] <+Grayhammatter> no they shouldn't
[1:30:26] <+Mailboy> i like her
[1:30:26] <mankeyfigh> @angriestpat But Paaaaat, the REAL END IS BEING RELEASED NEXT YEAR
[1:30:29] <+gunslinger_xxiv> HH windnegate aeroSip
[1:30:30] <+zanzibar_junker> kirin is easy
[1:30:30] <$monkeyhous3> Kirin is worse than Teo and Lun
[1:30:31] <UchiVsTheWorld> pat sometimes i wonder if you even like monster hunter
[1:30:32] <TyrantBelial> Fun fact, Lunastra is bugged to have her introductory event stats (from her pseci8al investigation) qwhich are higher then nher normal tempered stats, including aggression. I don\'t know if it's been fixed yet.
[1:30:37] <LeonSteel> Oh no i forgot orochi kirinb fuck
[1:30:38] <%goose_attack_almanac> Arigathanks Gozaimuch
[1:30:41] <%AncelDeLambert> Kirin needs to be bigger, yeah
[1:30:42] <$monkeyhous3> AT Kirin sucks ass
[1:30:47] <Nina96> I LOVE KELBI
[1:30:47] <+Aikanaros> isnt AT xeno harder?
[1:30:50] <thunderborn32> i just hate that they consider a recolor a 'new monster' fuck that
[1:30:52] <%Nobrev> Pat of Gripes
[1:30:52] <danknugglit> Are you going to fight leshen from the witcher crossover?
[1:30:55] <+Tokanova> good ol gog
[1:30:58] <+Grayhammatter> well, your buddies are doing great
[1:30:59] <+Mailboy> kirin is made for the greatsword though
[1:31:00] <%FrustratedAF> leshen is garbo
[1:31:01] <%VanaSkiller> fuck yea Gog
[1:31:01] <+gunslinger_xxiv> Kirin needs a gun
[1:31:03] <Greywolf47> gog is actually fun
[1:31:03] <ItsAGundamu> all the endgame monsters really suck, onec you beat the main game none of the new monsters are fun
[1:31:04] <%GarbageNirvana> I'm amazed I even beat tempered Kirin that one time
[1:31:05] <brambobelurkin> HEY GOG WAS FUN\
[1:31:06] <%GunEden> gog is stupid easy tho

[1:31:11] <+RedDeadApple> AT Kirin is alright takes about 20 mins on a sollo run which is the only way you should fight it
[1:31:11] <brambobelurkin> WATCH YOUR MOUTH
[1:31:13] <tiger_joe> gog is amazing
[1:31:13] <+allups> yeah but Xeno looks cooler
[1:31:13] <+Mailboy> GS trivializes the fight completely

[1:31:30] <xeros720> Plague is Gripe and Pat is not so Gripe
[1:31:34] <$monkeyhous3> BOMB HER
[1:31:36] <%Kirby_Sauce> Kushala is best dragon
[1:31:37] <+projectmanatees> the fact that the blue fire does dot makes it annoying
[1:31:38] <+Grayhammatter> time to blow her, UP
[1:31:43] <%FrustratedAF> bring the bombs
[1:31:44] <malesin_01> as a hammer main the stras aren't a problem
[1:31:44] <ItsAGundamu> sleepy time
[1:31:50] <%FrustratedAF> where are the barrel bombs?
[1:31:51] <ittla> I like monster variety much more than big huge hard fights

[1:31:52] <Nina96> u gonna try and hit it pat?
[1:31:52] <%Tennochief> LUL
[1:31:54] <brambobelurkin> Understandable. Kinda like Kulve

[1:32:03] <ItsAGundamu> wait why doesnt pat set off the bomb?
[1:32:04] <%arcaderabbit48> @Tomschiii Shadowbringers gave the Healers much more to use now, so it was pretty okay. White Mage is definitely easier than Scholar or Astro though
[1:32:04] <%dekkitout> Blow that bitch to kingdom come

[1:32:27] <$joylent_blue> fuck you Luna
[1:32:29] <$D4C_Trice> god ancient leshen is fuck awful
[1:32:30] <%FrustratedAF> WOOO
[1:32:30] <TsunTsuchinoko> youre the GS guy, you should be the one popping bombs
[1:32:30] <+zanzibar_junker> somehow has the glutton gun
[1:32:31] <Vigonept> yeah its great swords job
[1:32:32] <%AncelDeLambert> Yeah, Pat, that was your wake
[1:32:33] <+Grayhammatter> witcher crest
[1:32:33] <%Ninestempest> no, GS or dragon piercer can do it
[1:32:37] <%arcaderabbit48> Using any kind of melee weapon against a living fireball like this seems horrible. I see now why people hate it so much
[1:32:38] <Tomschiii> @arcaderabbit48 ah, got it
[1:32:43] <Daniel_Is_I> Ancient Leshen is a huge pain in the ass. Not Extremoth tier but still bad.
[1:32:46] <weontheultralightbeam> At least her gear is good
[1:32:48] <%Ninestempest> but bow wasn't doing it either
[1:32:48] <%FrustratedAF> witcher quest is OKAY idk about streaming it, honestly
[1:32:48] <Theoyveyman> Witcher quest is so good
[1:32:55] <+zanzibar_junker> that can stagger the kirin for days
[1:32:57] <@Velyndra> its GS job except pats bad
[1:32:58] <+Grayhammatter> you could have
[1:33:01] <+Yosepmeist> also who cares, shes dead
[1:33:07] <$joylent_blue> didn't care for the Witcher quest
[1:33:10] <brambobelurkin> I hated the Leshen
[1:33:15] <Vigonept> OPTIMIZATION
[1:33:16] <%Ninestempest> witcher quest is weird
[1:33:16] <+MetalMeltdown31> Technically, Luna's wings are weakest to slashing, so the pro move was pat wakes her up with a TCS to the wings and then you blow the bombs.
[1:33:19] <%logoth_> That witcher quest is a slog
[1:33:22] <%FrustratedAF> the leshen fight is annnoying
[1:33:22] <%Ninestempest> the leshen is a SHITTY fight
[1:33:24] <+Yosepmeist> Yeah the Witcher quest is boring
[1:33:25] <Tomschiii> the extreme leshen was the most difficutl fight i had until now
[1:33:25] <+RedDeadApple> Leshen was not a fun fight at all
[1:33:28] <Nina96> rub neck
[1:33:30] <danknugglit> Leshen was alright
[1:33:32] <+KaosMachina> can you change the color of the gold trim on your shirt separately
[1:33:32] <brambobelurkin> I wanted to like it so bad.
[1:33:34] <+MetalMeltdown31> Because Luna's hitzones are bullshit.

[1:51:48] <%Maids4lyfe> why would Epic do that
[1:52:03] <%logoth_> Naps are a trap
[1:52:06] <+Atomik456> they are cheap and incompetent
[1:52:08] <42nfl19> @AngriestPat is there a meta/team comp or are most weapons balanced that you can have any mix and even duplicates?
[1:52:09] <EuropanLamprey> Why would Epic.... is a common question
[1:52:11] <%starotter70> Do naps fuck with your sleep schedule?
[1:52:11] <%GarbageNirvana> Burn that midnight oil

[1:53:05] <eviljake9> sleeping is to paige what shitting is to pat
[1:53:05] <%Tennochief> SLEEP IS A BLESSING AND A CURSE
[1:53:06] <T_Sasquatch> I'd prefer not to have to sleep honestly but I enjoy it
[1:53:07] <%moogleboy1984> Sleep is the period of the day that you stop hurting, right?
[1:53:07] <Zteck123> Timmy Turner had that same dream, and look where that got him :u
[1:53:09] <%arcaderabbit48> I love sleeping, but I wish I didn't have to do it. Its wasted time

[1:53:33] <42nfl19> @AngriestPat are the weapons balanced enough that you can have any team comp even with duplicates?
[1:53:37] <Tomschiii> to constantly dream while sleeping just too much fun

[1:53:38] <Theoyveyman> Pat we know you won't hold out
[1:53:40] <%badchoice5> Paige, have you tried copious amounts of cocaine? I hear that solves the sleeping problem
[1:53:40] <%Deano8817> Can't go back to console if I never had it on console

[1:54:33] <DasLoad> Carl's Jr > Hardee's
[1:54:35] <%alcors_wisdom> western hardees
[1:54:46] <brambobelurkin> @alcors_wisdom We will be waiting for our food
[1:54:48] <%Masutasodo> I like the sauce in the bacon western cheeseburger
[1:54:53] <%Typhaeon> What the fuck is a sandwich friend
[1:54:54] <brambobelurkin> @alcors_wisdom and thank you
[1:54:56] <rasug> Where the Gamma armor what eeeewwww beta armor!
[1:55:10] <KitsuneManami> @AngriestPat Have you tried Tempered Vaal? his aura is hell and no gems can nerf it
[1:55:12] <%Kirby_Sauce> It's the friend who has bad opinions of sandwiches
[1:55:15] <Mr_pwng3> NONE?
[1:55:15] <%arcaderabbit48> Or a friend that brings you a sandwich?
[1:55:15] <%mckraven> Hardees tastes like expensive burger king
[1:55:16] <+TheIntellectional> all sandwiches are friends
[1:55:19] <Caidezes> I always get Hardee's and Arby's mixed up.
[1:55:21] <danknugglit> Food can be friend too
[1:55:25] <%BaronVonWolfe> BaronVonWolfe subscribed with Twitch Prime. 
[1:55:26] <%arcaderabbit48> Or maybe its a euphemism for sex
[1:55:28] <danknugglit> For a bit
[1:55:30] <%Kirby_Sauce> She thinks lettuce will make the bread soggy
[1:55:33] <%FrustratedAF> hardee's has food, arby's claims it has food
[1:55:33] <zashzila> EVO
[1:55:37] <KitsuneManami> See any of the new armors? Got a Favorite?
[1:55:38] <$joylent_blue> all the endgame content is ResidentSleeper
[1:55:39] <%logoth_> Arch Tempered has layered armor though
[1:55:47] <+TheIntellectional> gamma sets will be obselete come iceborne, I've been doing at for layered though
[1:55:49] <brambobelurkin> Good news though I dont know how many of you guys compared the weapon stats from the beta
[1:55:53] <%Kirby_Sauce> @arcaderabbit48 sorry, but PrideAsexual
[1:55:55] <brambobelurkin> but seems simialr to current weapon stats
[1:55:55] <@BigNaturalMan59> what should i get on my pizza
[1:55:57] <%Tennochief> I may have accidentally caused the McDonalds in my area to start charing people for BBQ sauce
[1:55:58] <%moogleboy1984> if you fall off the gear treadmill, whatever will become of your number?
[1:55:58] <weontheultralightbeam> AT Xeno is like the only well done AT monster
[1:56:04] <%logoth_> Fuck AT Xeno
[1:56:12] <$joylent_blue> AT Xeno can suck a dick
[1:56:14] <brambobelurkin> @weontheultralightbeam Amen
[1:56:14] <%logoth_> "Well done" yeah, if you're a ranged user
[1:56:15] <+AnxietyPrime> what armour is Pat using? looks rad (I recognise the Gala suit but not the rest)
[1:56:16] <%starotter70> @BigNaturalMan59 Cheese and nothing else
[1:56:18] <%sshen> @BigNaturalMan59 Pineapple with a side of pineapple
[1:56:23] <+EVA_Unit02> @logoth_ I'd take Apex over Tempered
[1:56:24] <%arcaderabbit48> @Kirby_Sauce Lol, same. I just like making sex jokes
[1:56:29] <%Zteck123> Zteck123 subscribed with Twitch Prime. 
[1:56:35] <Theoyveyman> AT Xeno = damage sponge
[1:56:36] <+TheIntellectional> behemoth + extreme are the best endgame fights imo
[1:56:37] <%AncelDeLambert> ... but it's big number go up
[1:56:37] <+wah_ha_ha> What do you guys mean, AT Zorah Magdaros is the best design Kappa
[1:56:37] <%Freelance7> I heard some of the arch tempereds aren't actually that bad
[1:56:41] <danknugglit> Yea at xeno was a mistake
[1:56:41] <brambobelurkin> @EVA_Unit02 No. Boun ing every hit was fucking cnacer
[1:56:46] <Hydrapissed> at xeno actually has alot of new moves lol
[1:56:47] <KitsuneManami> @AngriestPat I'll be honest, I used a Trainer to beat them so I could get 1 piece of gear that was awesome for my build, but HELL to beat them
[1:56:53] <+Cryghoul> my god the screen is flooded
[1:56:58] <rasug> Wtf why not gamma armor are so gooooood!!
[1:57:10] <brambobelurkin> @EVA_Unit02 Im tilted just thinking of Apex Rajang and Jho again
[1:57:11] <Hydrapissed> and gamma xeno is great for gunners
[1:57:11] <%arcaderabbit48> Use the giant wall spikes, or something I guess
[1:57:13] <%AncelDeLambert> gamma sets are insano strong
[1:57:13] <Greywolf47> AT nerg spam mmm death tastes nice
[1:57:15] <%sshen> what is happening
[1:57:16] <KitsuneManami> Oh and to get Ciri layered Armor
[1:57:17] <%Agami23> god damn, it looked like you slashed a rathalos fireball in half in the air
[1:57:24] <bear_breaker20> still say gillie suit is hard cheating
[1:57:27] <%Tennochief> @KitsuneManami soome monsters are able to overide a trainer, Behemoth says fuck you to not dying
[1:57:31] <+wah_ha_ha> Well won't the gamma armors be obsolete with the release of Iceborne since they have higher tiered stuff?
[1:57:39] <%dekkitout> Doesn't matter how good the armor can be, AT is a poor implementation of challenge
[1:57:48] <%starotter70> Pat sees number, Pat is pleased
[1:57:53] <ovan20> this fight is a mess LUL
[1:57:55] <KitsuneManami> @Tennochief Behemoth is also fun to fight and not a annoying spam fucker who makes fights super painful
[1:58:05] <brambobelurkin> @wah_ha_ha the Defense bonus difference between the grank beta armor and drachen was only about 20 per piece.
[1:58:07] <+AWr00tBear> R series Armor Quest line in MHGU was a lot more fun than Arch Temp Elder dragons in World.
[1:58:10] <%badchoice5> "This greatsword is a high skill weapon" -Pat, swinging at, you know, whatever
[1:58:11] <+EVA_Unit02> You'd need high tier stuff to get higher tiered stuff @dekkitout
[1:58:18] <%AncelDeLambert> Iceborn isnt until next year on the pc, so gimme gammas
[1:58:27] <%Tennochief> @KitsuneManami true, and watching Behemoth use the hunter like a ragdoll is the best worst thing to see
[1:58:28] <+EVA_Unit02> Unless you're gdlk @dekkitout
[1:58:28] <KitsuneManami> @AncelDeLambert Crhistmas
[1:58:33] <%AncelDeLambert> PC
[1:58:34] <ittla> @AngriestPat how miserable is the grind for the rathalos mount in ff14? is it even still available?
[1:58:43] <DoubleOMurfy93> is the session private?
[1:58:46] <+jorgamund> ...is that a rocket powered greatsword?
[1:58:50] <%Zteck123> fucking behemoth
[1:58:51] <+wah_ha_ha> @brambobelurkin I mean won't there possibly be better skill combos and maybe new skill abilities sets
[1:58:52] <%arcaderabbit48> I dont even know why we are fighting these things
[1:58:56] <%AncelDeLambert> the release date for Iceborn PC has been set for January of 2020
[1:59:00] <$joylent_blue> Ruby PogChamp
[1:59:02] <+Rose_Silver> the fight is easy tbh
[1:59:04] <%Tennochief> @arcaderabbit48 population control
[1:59:05] <KitsuneManami> @AncelDeLambert they said christmas
[1:59:06] <ittla> but how long does it take
[1:59:11] <Theoyveyman> what's the average difficulty expected for Iceborne?
[1:59:12] <syberfrost97> You‚Äôve inspired me to make videos on my freedom unite
[1:59:13] <ittla> time is my most valuable resource
[1:59:13] <+Zxtole> It's miserable if you do it in PF, so many people fail that stuff
[1:59:16] <$joylent_blue> wtf 2 rubies
[1:59:18] <$joylent_blue> fuk u pat
[1:59:19] <Archmortal> If you get really lucky it might just drop from the chest. It has about the same drop rate that Nightmare does/did in ARR
[1:59:22] <KitsuneManami> @AngriestPat Tempered Mantle = Ultra Instinct
[1:59:24] <LeonSteel> OW FUCK OFF
[1:59:27] <+projectmanatees> Pat have you done the behomth hunt?
[1:59:27] <brambobelurkin> @wah_ha_ha yes, but I would imagine most of your stuff will last for the first few hunts
[1:59:28] <+Rose_Silver> takes 5 minutes per fight if you know what you're doing and you need to kill it 50 times
[1:59:28] <%arcaderabbit48> @Tennochief I know, I mean why is Pat hunting these monsters specifically. Like for the drops, or what?
[1:59:29] <bear_breaker20> dont skip content in ff14 otherwise why play
[1:59:35] <@JustinianKnight> I got my Rath justin92NoxusFace
[1:59:35] <+KoyaMusa> rathalos mount CAN drop but if not you need to do 50 runs
[1:59:39] <%GarbageNirvana> Just a friendly reminder that we do have a FC on Ultros
[1:59:40] <@Velyndra> Rathalos mount in FFXIV is 50 runs of ex. The fights not hard, just annoying
[1:59:41] <T_Sasquatch> @arcaderabbit48 hunters are literally maintaining balance of life
[1:59:41] <%Tennochief> @arcaderabbit48 oh, just clearing his backlog
[1:59:49] <@Velyndra> also can drop from the fight but the rate is low
[1:59:50] <Skeletonmanners> iceborne equipement should make tempered way easier
[1:59:52] <+TheIntellectional> inb4 arch tempered master rank monsters
[1:59:57] <42nfl19> @AngriestPat How do team comps work? Any mix is fine? Even crazy x4 duplicates work? How is it balanced?
[1:59:58] <malesin_01> early master rank= teir 2 tempered
[2:00:02] <brambobelurkin> @wah_ha_ha or at least buy you time to get the G rank armor.
[2:00:02] <%BaronVonWolfe> I really wanna get deeperi into Monster Hunter, but it just requires a level of pragmatism that I can't embrace. Cheer100
[2:00:04] <%arcaderabbit48> Makes sense
[2:00:05] <%Typhaeon> Basically you're watching Pat do spring cleaning
[2:00:08] <%Zteck123> why play FF at all ._.
[2:00:11] <KitsuneManami> @AngriestPat PAT! Listen to the official english Ultimate Battle from DB Super. Its god awful
[2:00:18] <bear_breaker20> why even at all...
[2:00:21] <+Rose_Silver> cos FFxiv is a great game
[2:00:26] <+jorgamund> grinding a year in advance?
[2:00:28] <+rei0> r u double-dipping?
[2:00:32] <%sshen> Pat really wants that rainbow pigment
[2:00:35] <%FrustratedAF> pat is NOT double-dipping
[2:00:46] <Greywolf47> spring cleaning but the sping festival is over.
[2:00:47] <+rei0> ah nice
[2:00:47] <%FrustratedAF> ps4 load times aaarreee... not good
[2:00:50] <KitsuneManami> Geralt

[2:00:59] <%Zteck123> holy shit she has a voice

[2:01:10] <%vectorless_peon> slightly smoother fallout ghoul?

[2:01:17] <bear_breaker20> still fucking jarring to hear monhun characters speak english over gibberish
[2:01:19] <tetriata> Doesn't this quest bug out hard if you use this mod that makes these npcs appear in the gathering hub?
[2:01:27] <Theoyveyman> so are you gonna try to avoid iceborne spoilers for the next few months?
[2:01:28] <KitsuneManami> @AngriestPat Witcher
[2:01:30] <+TheIntellectional> it's a creature whose name you cant say on twitch
[2:01:34] <KingVantq> @AngriestPat witcher
[2:01:34] <T_Sasquatch> gathering hub fucking sucks

[2:01:36] <+Quinn_Carter> Head to the Research Base
[2:01:36] <Greywolf47> witcher quest
[2:01:36] <%GyroBrando> Geralt and shit
[2:01:36] <%FrustratedAF> is there a cactuar in the hub???
[2:01:37] <%Nobrev> you have her modded to stand there @AngriestPat
[2:01:38] <%arcaderabbit48> That's Karen Strassmen. She voices one of the people downstairs. And also Nanako
[2:01:40] <DoubleOMurfy93> its the witcher crossover
[2:01:41] <%Agami23> she isnt supposed to be here, your mods @AngriestPat
[2:01:42] <ChuckMagnus> That's supposed to take place at the third fleet base
[2:01:44] <%enickma11> @AngriestPat You talk to her at the Research Base for a quest
[2:01:46] <Videogamer4> go to the research base pat
[2:01:48] <Greywolf47> go to the third base
[2:01:52] <DoubleOMurfy93> you need to go to the other base
[2:01:52] <mayorrev> wait there was a Witcher crossover?
[2:01:53] <%Kirby_Sauce> It's the witcher thing. Your mod messed it up
[2:01:58] <syberfrost97> Deviljho again?
[2:02:01] <%Kirby_Sauce> Do the witcher
[2:02:02] <%JusTTheGuyYouNeed> witcher quest line
[2:02:03] <TyrantBelial> you just broke your witcher quest
[2:02:18] <DoubleOMurfy93> just talk to her in the other base to start the quest
[2:02:40] <KitsuneManami> @AngriestPat Why no Titty Mods?
[2:02:45] <$joylent_blue> Kirin DansGame
[2:02:45] <%zeroarturia> Whoppsie
[2:02:47] <+Yosepmeist> its ok, the witcher quest is boring anyways Kappa Kappa
[2:02:48] <%badchoice5> yaaaay,
[2:02:49] <ittla> stupid hornse
[2:02:58] <danknugglit> NotLikeThis
[2:02:59] <%Tennochief> Kirin = Karen
[2:02:59] <+patel347> is the element weakness on the icon also a mod?
[2:03:00] <%zeroarturia> Fuck taht Horse
[2:03:00] <Greywolf47> kirin hates fire so just burn their face off.
[2:03:01] <%Zteck123> Kirin is like super easy to kill though :u
[2:03:01] <%badchoice5> Kirin, that most enjoyable of monsters
[2:03:04] <TyrantBelial> Yes but it has permanent buffs to your entire game.
[2:03:10] <%FrustratedAF> dude the witcher quest really isn't that much fun and i'm not sure it'd be good for a stream either
[2:03:19] <ittla> kirin is miserable because that's what you get for wanting battle panties
[2:03:20] <%FrustratedAF> kirin the bbbiitttcchhh
[2:03:22] <%Zteck123> just dont use melee on it
[2:03:28] <%badchoice5> I like the part where random bullshit zaps you to death
[2:03:29] <%zeroarturia> How do you break a quest?
[2:03:29] <42nfl19> Can any weapon comp work in this game? Even all same weapon team? Or are there still elitist like in MMOs? i.e. the weapon team balance? since there isnt really "classes".
[2:03:38] <reonome> PogChamp geralt
[2:03:38] <TyrantBelial> like boosting gajalaka blitzkriegs which work on elder draghons which is good.
[2:03:38] <tetriata> You break a quest by using mods
[2:03:39] <%logoth_> Witcher quest gives an attack gem, but it looks like pat modded himself all gems anyway
[2:03:43] <T_Sasquatch> Geraldo PogChamp
[2:03:45] <+OrochiTabris> don't use melee on it? crazy talk
[2:03:46] <%Deano8817> praise geraldo
[2:03:48] <danknugglit> With mods
[2:03:52] <KitsuneManami> @AngriestPat Please take off the helm first lol
[2:03:55] <%GarbageNirvana> Cracks me up that Geralt can basically cameo in anything because portals
[2:03:58] <Tomschiii> why is the music so menacing
[2:03:58] <%starotter70> Is that the Witch Man!? PogChamp
[2:04:02] <bear_breaker20> Geralt: doesnt know where he is* as usual
[2:04:03] <%zeroarturia> Hwy its Jerry from the River!!
[2:04:04] <%Kirby_Sauce> Cheer500 kirby's unpopular opinions vol 7: I like the handler, and she and her costumes are sweet.
[2:04:07] <%logoth_> Mod handler to look like Guild marm
[2:04:09] <+Yosepmeist> @42nfl19 theres def a meta but you can get by with whatever

[2:06:51] <+AWr00tBear> You would need to in Iceborne
[2:06:52] <+gunslinger_xxiv> It's the only bug I've encountered this whole time
[2:06:52] <KitsuneManami> @AngriestPat oh so like Iceborne?
[2:06:58] <%starotter70> Man, those FE shitposts were pretty good
[2:07:02] <Nevy4256> Hey pat, hey chat. I'm here for the hont
[2:07:04] <%0dokuro> Trying to recruit all the students.
[2:07:13] <Greywolf47> honk honk
[2:07:13] <syberfrost97> When you wait for iceborne and you and the boys torture monsters to pass time
[2:07:13] <%sshen> MUA3 has eaten 60hours of my life, alongside FF14 I don't have time for FE
[2:07:13] <42nfl19> @AngriestPat is there a weapon team comp/meta or you can do whatever? I would hate to play with elitist hating on things. How are all same weapon comps?
[2:07:27] <%zeroarturia> @TenderBabyBacon Oh thank you for telling me!! But wait I thought they had to shut down?
[2:07:35] <%nmaten> 4 hunting horns
[2:07:36] <Vigonept> whats youre favorite waifu from three houses
[2:07:36] <+DZiffer> Broke the game and didn't even use sexy armor mods smh
[2:07:37] <%Tennochief> @AngriestPat Hey Pat, if you were going to install any armor mod, which armor set would you get first?
[2:07:37] <JetpackMcQuack> I judge a games quality by the shitposts it inspires
[2:07:39] <T_Sasquatch> comp LUL
[2:07:44] <ittla> maybe in iceborne hunting horn might matter!!!
[2:07:51] <reonome> comp in MH LUL
[2:07:51] <GamerWorlock> except for behemoth
[2:07:53] <ittla> fuckin crossing fingers for that
[2:07:55] <%dekkitout> If you want meta, just look into speedrunning
[2:07:55] <StuffHunter> Wide-Range if you don't trust others to not die, that's about it.
[2:07:57] <+TaurusOxford> @ittla HH got big buffs in IB.
[2:08:00] <+gunslinger_xxiv> The NPC mod came out like a month after the game released on PC
[2:08:00] <Greywolf47> no bully HH
[2:08:00] <KitsuneManami> @AngriestPat I know you tried, but.. in the end? did it matter?
[2:08:01] <42nfl19> Hit the thing and dont get hit, that is the bases of all games, genius
[2:08:01] <+zaworldo> talk to da c a t s
[2:08:02] <+Double_Tap_That> @ittla You shut your mouth. HH is the best weapon.
[2:08:03] <KingVantq> as long as you dont die or knock people around no one cares what you run
[2:08:10] <+AWr00tBear> Except for Extremoth
[2:08:10] <Klarrann3> what armor set is that?
[2:08:18] <Supathief> @42nfl19 The only people care about is you not dying. You can do any weapon any time.
[2:08:19] <+zaworldo> DA C A T S
[2:08:23] <ittla> too bad the monhun world devs didnt think so double
[2:08:35] <mybigmeech> Very good
[2:08:36] <%Agami23> well according to my online experience, the best team comp is 3 dead longsword users and one living lance user
[2:08:38] <+Yosepmeist> HH dosn't get used because it's too complicated, not because its not good
[2:08:42] <weontheultralightbeam> monkaS

[2:19:43] <%moogleboy1984> guyliner
[2:19:45] <%SolverCODO> mmm witcher music
[2:19:54] <aero160h> does pat know which monster he's hunting in this quest?
[2:20:01] <%Deano8817> @AngriestPat by the way, timer on this mission, and it sucks
[2:20:02] <TalekAetem> Better drink a potion
[2:20:04] <+Grayhammatter> that is NOT appropriate to the witchy style
[2:20:08] <%Faustgesicht> you get that sns back on mister
[2:20:09] <EvanAlmighty210> There‚Äôs a Geralt dlc?
[2:20:09] <danknugglit> Geralt with gun
[2:20:10] <thegreenbenis> I sure hope they play silver for monsters
[2:20:10] <+Quinn_Carter> Don't spoil the monster
[2:20:11] <NDenizen> Anyone else remember the part in TW3 when Geralt cleaved a Rathalos in two?
[2:20:12] <Vigonept> that's so dumb
[2:20:15] <+zaworldo> USE GUN
[2:20:20] <$joylent_blue> i think i beat this mission with like 20 seconds to spare
[2:20:23] <%starotter70> Never played Witcher games before, buit DAMN that OST is great!
[2:20:23] <%SolverCODO> fuck this makes me wanna play Witcher 3 again. that game is so fuckin good, i need to forget more of it so i can play it again
[2:20:24] <Schuhart> Gotta save that Pukei
[2:20:25] <+alpacasintophats> The power of gun resonates with this one
[2:20:27] <+Nomicro4u> His run cycle kinda looks funny
[2:20:28] <ittla> portals are lore friendly, but idk about using greatswords
[2:20:33] <RantingRavager> I loved the part in the new witcher DLC where he jammed out on the hunting horn
[2:20:38] <+primax104> talk to the girl first
[2:20:45] <+LastHazzerd> Psycho Mantis?
[2:20:50] <+Quinn_Carter> Geralt has a bunch of lines in this mission depending where you go, what you pick up and what you kill.
[2:20:52] <sonofthedeepsouth> This man is so tired
[2:20:53] <+LastHazzerd> You're that monster...
[2:20:54] <Aquaticblueshark> this isnt fire emblem three houses :o
[2:20:55] <+Double_Tap_That> oh no
[2:20:56] <+Double_Tap_That> not her
[2:20:57] <%Tearonex> @AngriestPat he has dialogue for picked up different things on the map
[2:21:06] <Tomschiii> @SolverCODO same but i dont want to go through that gameplay again kinda
[2:21:06] <KeiPrime> geralt talking in monster hunter language is pretty weird if u ever turn tha ton
[2:21:11] <+DZiffer> "Hah, you can't defeat me without your silver sword, witcher!" "The last time I fell through a portal I found something better than a silver sword - THIS GUN!"
[2:21:12] <ittla> is this structured like a witcher 3 quest?
[2:21:16] <weontheultralightbeam> yes
[2:21:18] <Tomschiii> that voice
[2:21:20] <+primax104> avsolutely it is
[2:21:23] <sonofthedeepsouth> WILL GERALT FUCK
[2:21:24] <+LastHazzerd> pfff, witcher cutscenes
[2:21:26] <%SolverCODO> @Tomschiii there are some good combat mods that make it a lot more fun
[2:21:26] <thegreenbenis> This is so goofy, I love it.
[2:21:29] <danknugglit> Thes a dualblade foe ciri too
[2:21:29] <+primax104> they put a lot of work into this quest
[2:21:31] <+wah_ha_ha> Witcher :Sleep with me
[2:21:31] <sonofthedeepsouth> GERALT MUST FUCK
[2:21:32] <thegreenbenis> Geralt gonna fuck

[2:21:54] <%SolverCODO> PogChamp
[2:21:55] <ittla> you're just playing the witcher
[2:21:56] <+Pixel_Matt> rooXD
[2:22:00] <%MagickBurritoh> Educational
[2:22:02] <ricotez> I like how much effort they put into making the gameplay just like the original game
[2:22:03] <Tomschiii> @SolverCODO i think even with mods it is not enough. but idk
[2:22:13] <%GunEden> so i guess jerry is going to bone her?
[2:22:15] <EuropanLamprey> Fucking Cartoon gremlin voice
[2:22:16] <ricotez> the Bahamut fight is just like a FFXIV trial, this is just like a Witcher quest
[2:22:17] <%arancet> the dissonance in this is amazing
[2:22:20] <%Tennochief> Definetly
[2:22:24] <+allups> he's fast to lay down the D
[2:22:25] <hntronium> Is that a boy?
[2:22:27] <bear_breaker20> isnt Geralt gonna lose his shit when he sees how large the average monster is
[2:22:29] <%keyworthe> quick switch the game you're playing to the witcher 3 wild hunt
[2:22:30] <%AncelDeLambert> I hate her voice. I hate his voice. I hate everyone's voices
[2:22:31] <+Dingalow> Her voice sure grates on me
[2:22:35] <Jolnir> Her textures are sick
[2:22:36] <%Tennochief> after her, every single girl in the event area
[2:22:39] <danknugglit> I want to play witcher again
[2:22:52] <RantingRavager> Clever Girl
[2:22:55] <thegreenbenis> Fuck gonna have to redownload witcher 3.
[2:22:56] <mayorrev> @angriestpat man why doesn't the monster Hunter talk this much
[2:22:56] <ittla> I wonder what this is like with monhun language on
[2:23:03] <Tomschiii> @AncelDeLambert i can understand about her voice, but his?
[2:23:04] <alwayspronking> fucking birds
[2:23:05] <Caidezes> Why is she talking like that?
[2:23:14] <%VanaSkiller> geralt speaks monhun
[2:23:14] <%SolverCODO> I like her voice!
[2:23:15] <%AncelDeLambert> his monotone is annoying very quickly
[2:23:25] <+Quinn_Carter> You can talk to her again
[2:23:26] <KeiPrime> i wish she were my handler instead of the handler tho..
[2:23:26] <+BioHunter> bye kairi
[2:23:26] <TalekAetem> Cyberpunk crossover with MonHun when
[2:23:27] <vinceshamwowslap> Did witcher intentionally make their hunts like monster hunter
[2:23:30] <professormorrigan> naw, i like geralts VA
[2:23:31] <+Quinn_Carter> And get her life story
[2:23:31] <thegreenbenis> This is the best.
[2:23:32] <+primax104> talk to her more!
[2:23:32] <InugamiTheHound> why does she sound like a digimon character??
[2:23:34] <+DZiffer> Is that "better handler"?
[2:23:35] <sonofthedeepsouth> Oh fuck is this just witcher
[2:23:36] <+LastHazzerd> It's actually just a Witcher quest
[2:23:42] <+primax104> she had a whole back story!
[2:23:42] <%Zteck123> Her voice is breutiful u uncultured swine >;u
[2:23:43] <NDenizen> g o t t a b e
[2:23:58] <+Double_Tap_That> At least they used the same VA from her voice quips.
[2:24:04] <Clinnamon> geralt's been really well done in all his crossovers
[2:24:05] <ittla> it's just as faithful as the fuckin DUTY COMMENCED in the behemoth fight
[2:24:05] <+LastHazzerd> this is a $$$ crossover
[2:24:06] <+primax104> she has more dialogue pat!
[2:24:06] <thegreenbenis> I'm amazed how legit they went.
[2:24:07] <%Tennochief> Geralt is the key for any piece of crossover fanfiction
[2:24:09] <%SolverCODO> wind's howling
[2:24:10] <%FrogCatapult> Oh god the music
[2:24:11] <Tomschiii> @AncelDeLambert i think it grows on you and it kinda fits him
[2:24:12] <%TheGrumpyDumps> TheGrumpyDumps subscribed with Twitch Prime. 
[2:24:12] <+wah_ha_ha> She's Velma!!
[2:24:33] <vinceshamwowslap> How did this even happen
[2:24:35] <danknugglit> But wait, theres more
[2:24:37] <42nfl19> So what's his weapon type for this and does he still retain his magic?
[2:24:38] <%drabberfaun535> @AngriestPat the consensus of everyone ive talked to is that THIS is a crossover done right.
[2:24:39] <mayorrev> MINECRAFT
[2:24:45] <NDenizen> Geralt just materalises a pick-axe
[2:24:55] <+primax104> talk more to the first girl
[2:24:57] <+DZiffer> Place of power, gotta be!
[2:25:04] <%keyworthe> you're doing a side quest
[2:25:05] <Greywolf47> i like the witcher collab over the final fantasy one
[2:25:05] <%Tennochief> damn the thunder is fucking angry right now in FLorida
[2:25:09] <%keyworthe> just finish that
[2:25:09] <Schuhart> You will stumble over that side quest if you do the main
[2:25:10] <+Quinn_Carter> Talk to everyone, there are two sidequests you can do in this mission.
[2:25:20] <Nevy4256> So now that we're chill, chat, how are y'all?
[2:25:23] <professormorrigan> this just makes me want to play the witcher again Kappa
[2:25:28] <%Tennochief> pretty good
[2:25:35] <%starotter70> Not bad
[2:25:37] <ittla> im in florida and no thunder
[2:25:40] <ittla> should i be worried
[2:25:45] <Schuhart> The second one is a chore, but really cute
[2:25:45] <NDenizen> Keep in mind there is a time limit so you're better off just doing the main quest first
[2:25:46] <+KingZaffy> You'll definitely want to do the side quests, the rewards are pretty great.
[2:25:47] <+Quinn_Carter> If you do the sidequests before finishing the mission, you get extra rewards.
[2:25:56] <InugamiTheHound> Florida is sinking like the sinking city because of climate change
[2:26:00] <%Tennochief> maybe not, we've been having a case of scattered showers and storms
[2:26:08] <%alcors_wisdom> you have to do the side quest in order otherwise they both fail
[2:26:15] <%starotter70> @InugamiTheHound And the madness
[2:26:15] <%GarbageNirvana> Imagine Geralt and Solid Snake having a conversation
[2:26:15] <Kavizimo> @AngriestPat you can get an extra attack jewel if you do all the side quests
[2:26:18] <+Quinn_Carter> One of the rewards is a permanent world change
[2:26:21] <%Tennochief> fuck ton of lightining though
[2:26:22] <Tomschiii> @NDenizen noone has problems with the time limits^^
[2:26:36] <alwayspronking> big lies
[2:26:41] <+zaworldo> BIG lies
[2:26:41] <+DZiffer> Oh man, I would switch scout flies to Witcher Sense in a heartbeat
[2:26:42] <Schuhart> You just have to do them BEFORE you kill the last Monster
[2:26:42] <Tomschiii> nonsense
[2:26:43] <Klarrann3> 3
[2:26:44] <+Double_Tap_That> Nope, that's wrong
[2:26:45] <Greywolf47> lies
[2:26:47] <Caidezes> 3
[2:26:48] <%GyroBrando> Chat lie
[2:26:50] <KiraKamixephos> Who LIED
[2:26:50] <Videogamer4> 3
[2:26:51] <%alcors_wisdom> really?
[2:26:53] <+Grayhammatter> 3
[2:26:54] <+zaworldo> Just do them before you complete the main quest
[2:26:54] <%JusTTheGuyYouNeed> 3
[2:26:55] <%starotter70> It's fictional
[2:26:57] <godlesscruelty> You just have to do both side quests before the boss, order doesnt matter
[2:26:57] <NDenizen> If you take your time and also don't help the Pukei then it's all pointless
[2:26:57] <InugamiTheHound> @starotter70 you got fish people, Florida man and bath salts and madness
[2:26:59] <+KingZaffy> You just need to clear them before actually killing the target monster.
[2:27:01] <%JusTTheGuyYouNeed> that dude lied
[2:27:03] <EuropanLamprey> Pat always sees the one liar
[2:27:03] <mojokingizakku> ban the liar
[2:27:04] <TyrantBelial> you just can't kill the main monster.
[2:27:05] <%alcors_wisdom> thats the only way i could get them not to fail for me but fuck me if im wrong
[2:27:06] <+Double_Tap_That> You do have to do a fight plus the sidequests, so don't dilly-dally.
[2:27:09] <+Quinn_Carter> You just have to do the sidequests before fighting the last monster
[2:27:25] <+zaworldo> Hope pat sees the truth
[2:27:28] <ashuckel> you'll likely fail to do both on your first run through, just enjoy it now and then "do it properly" later
[2:27:35] <%bakiinthedemon> It's really funny watching Geralt go all CSI in this silly "hit the big monster with your giant bone sword" game
[2:27:35] <+Tokanova> wonder if they had help from team projectred to make this
[2:27:44] <+Nomicro4u> gotta be
[2:27:46] <%SolverCODO> gotta be
[2:27:47] <Greywolf47> there is a certain point in the main quest line that will lock you out of doing side quests so finish the side quests firs
[2:27:50] <+LastHazzerd> that's.... new
[2:27:50] <+LocalRobyn> gotta be
[2:27:51] <+Grayhammatter> that's a big magic
[2:27:53] <vinceshamwowslap> Me to I wonder
[2:27:56] <%SolverCODO> he said it, he said the thing
[2:28:03] <%Estuko> Jerry? PogChamp
[2:28:05] <+LocalRobyn> it's a tree, gotta be
[2:28:11] <vinceshamwowslap> This is a cool collab
[2:28:12] <+Dingalow> I've never played Witcher 3, is it as good as all the #gamers say it is?
[2:28:14] <%SolverCODO> more tracks, gotta be
[2:28:14] <fruit_pie_the_magician> I only beat this mission with like two minutes left
[2:28:17] <%Tennochief> yes
[2:28:21] <Kavizimo> How you like that silver?
[2:28:25] <+AeroHeadVG> @Dingalow yes

[2:29:12] <$NitronStreams> Gertrude of the Rebellion
[2:29:16] <Tomschiii> @go4thekneez a fine joke
[2:29:16] <shinichizio> I wonder if Geralt has a MonHun Language track.
[2:29:20] <%Estuko> Spunky uwu
[2:29:25] <+jcenderion> Is this a mod?
[2:29:27] <+Dingalow> Wow you don't say

[2:29:54] <+Dingalow> Might play it after I finish FFXV
[2:30:11] <BionicPulga> Dat Witcher music.
[2:30:15] <%Estuko> FeelsGoodMan <3

[2:30:20] <%Tennochief> thanks
[2:30:21] <+jcenderion> @ovan20 I figured they just ripped his voice lines
[2:30:23] <%Estuko> that's actually pretty good
[2:30:28] <$joylent_blue> NDenizen LUL its true
[2:30:51] <%p_squid> Did @AngriestPat do the FFXIV stuff yet?
[2:31:03] <%Estuko> "You can smash the famous hunter.
[2:31:03] <%Zteck123> ignore him and pick his pockets
[2:31:06] <TyrantBelial> Scientists in monhun have very little sense of survival
[2:31:12] <Caidezes> Yeah.
[2:31:15] <+primax104> he actually says that
[2:31:19] <Greywolf47> he must be confused
[2:31:24] <+SeanConnery94> omg even the dialogue options look the same
[2:31:25] <+Nomicro4u> If only real life was like that
[2:31:28] <%AncelDeLambert> yeah, because this world has monsters that nuke villages
[2:31:29] <+SeanConnery94> thats pretty cool
[2:31:29] <bear_breaker20> they dont call him out when he implies hell leave him for dead...
[2:31:29] <Sunstalker> are there even villains in MH?
[2:31:32] <%Kirby_Sauce> NORTH
[2:31:32] <Tomschiii> pukei, pukei
[2:31:37] <+primax104> he thinks that since there are no food problems, everyone is just jappier
[2:31:38] <Gamblor69> Burn them
[2:31:39] <+jorgamund> ok, so to deal with these roots, we're gonna need some kerosene and a lighter...
[2:31:40] <+Grayhammatter> save da pukei
[2:31:40] <%tebari> Now I have a sudden urge to play both Monster Hunter and Witcher 3. :O

[2:31:48] <%RupanSen> he's like tripping balls in this weird cartoon world of SF3
[2:31:51] <+tylerpyre> Geralt being here makes me realize how much everyone nods in this series
[2:31:51] <%AncelDeLambert> Entire COUNTRIES have been wiped out by Elder Dragons in this world, they value the shit out of hunters
[2:31:52] <+Quinn_Carter> "I'm gonna free you." *Runs away*
[2:31:54] <Tomschiii> awwww :(

[2:34:43] <TheHeroAppears> he uses the plants to fill his soul hole
[2:34:45] <bear_breaker20> this feels like a gacha quest how much dialogue they give this literal nobody
[2:34:48] <%Zteck123> more like time for plants to fuck you
[2:35:04] <TyrantBelial> I like that every single character in monhun has a big character behind them. But most of it is just in the design works.
[2:35:06] <%sshen> Is this science guy filling his soul hole with plants too Pat?
[2:35:07] <%Estuko> BE but for plants Kappa

[2:35:25] <+Double_Tap_That> @Zteck123 I mean, I've seen enough h***** to know what those living roots could be used for.
[2:35:25] <T_Sasquatch> @bear_breaker20 gave you played the Witcher ??
[2:35:37] <Tomschiii> @TyrantBelial that sarcasm?
[2:35:38] <professormorrigan> Leshen, gotta be. ü§î
[2:35:39] <%SolverCODO> with all this detail in this conversation I feel like this whole quest line was written by the witcher writers
[2:35:39] <Greywolf47> mmm plant din din
[2:35:40] <bear_breaker20> thats fair
[2:35:42] <DrFaustMD> @schuhart the Witcher series does that
[2:35:45] <@commanderclaw> The sidequests in this mission are a bitch
[2:35:48] <KuroTendouSouji> Why is Gerry the Horse here?
[2:35:50] <T_Sasquatch> This is literally how a Witcher 3 quest goes
[2:35:55] <RantingRavager> Pookey Pookey
[2:35:56] <TyrantBelial> No. Characters all have actual names but just get called their title in monhun.
[2:35:58] <Schuhart> Qute beasts!
[2:36:02] <+jcenderion> Hrnnn pukei pukei?
[2:36:02] <+LastHazzerd> are they "Tasty"
[2:36:06] <$joylent_blue> hearing Geralt say pukei pukei LUL
[2:36:16] <TyrantBelial> monhun dumps out alot of "not fighting monsters" stuff when making the game.
[2:36:17] <+Double_Tap_That> "Quite charming"
[2:36:20] <DrFaustMD> he fucks them doesn't he
[2:36:21] <Tomschiii> @TyrantBelial names dont make a character (interesting^^
[2:36:24] <T_Sasquatch> Rero rero
[2:36:25] <+Theworld732> they can also shoot water out of their disgusting tails
[2:36:28] <bear_breaker20> its just funnier in the context of a monhun game cause theres %0 chance this guy will talk again
[2:36:31] <+LastHazzerd> no, he fucks plants, weren't you listin'?
[2:36:34] <CrypticMochi> Bondage play
[2:36:36] <$NitronStreams> is Jerry literally just fantasy Solid Snake?
[2:36:42] <+Double_Tap_That> @DrFaustMD What else are you gonna use that tongue for?
[2:36:43] <%Kirby_Sauce> he reminds me of Rohan
[2:36:44] <%RupanSen> moshi moshi Geraruto desu
[2:36:54] <%Maids4lyfe> Guild Marm is the one who fucks monsters
[2:36:57] <+Quinn_Carter> You can talk to the endemic life researcher again and get her backstory
[2:37:02] <KeiPrime> guildmarm... please ocme back
[2:37:02] <%Estuko> @Maids4lyfe BEST GIRL
[2:37:02] <Axle13j> hit up a bone pile
[2:37:03] <+jcenderion> Achtuaclly its BIO-ENERGY
[2:37:05] <Schuhart> @AngriestPat Now go to the exclamation point quest marker
[2:37:08] <shoobieredgrave> Is soul calibur and mhw canon in the witcher universe?
[2:37:09] <%Maids4lyfe> LUL
[2:37:14] <%Maids4lyfe> yes shoobie
[2:37:17] <Nanomachiner> He's actually really gonna want to explore this map completely
[2:37:27] <Greywolf47> camp 11?
[2:37:28] <+Quinn_Carter> You can also go to the first camp to talk to the handler
[2:37:28] <%Kirby_Sauce> UP
[2:37:30] <%Zteck123> I like how this one npc has been more helpful than the Handler has been the entire game
[2:37:37] <Schuhart> Oh yeeah, you gotta progress more in the main quets
[2:37:43] <Caidezes> @shoobieredgrave Yes. Because portals.
[2:37:47] <Nanomachiner> @AngriestPat There ARE hidden sidequests on this map you may wanna look for
[2:37:50] <TyrantBelial> Oh right there's hidden quests too.
[2:37:51] <+Tiewolf> is this PC?
[2:37:55] <$joylent_blue> yes this is pc
[2:37:57] <ovan20> @AngriestPat what's the weapon for when you use Geralt?
[2:37:58] <Greywolf47> gotta explore more
[2:37:58] <+TunakIn> man i hope geralt stumbles upon the pickle
[2:38:04] <+Double_Tap_That> Those pants really fit Geralt's ass nicely.
[2:38:11] <@commanderclaw> You can repeat
[2:38:11] <+KingZaffy> This quest is repeatable
[2:38:11] <alwayspronking> nope, multiple times
[2:38:13] <+alpacasintophats> nah you can redo it as many times you want
[2:38:14] <KuroTendouSouji> @angriestpat how do you feel about Hero getting banned at launch by multiple local and regional tournaments
[2:38:14] <Schuhart> SnS
[2:38:15] <Greywolf47> multiple times
[2:38:15] <%Kirby_Sauce> as many times as you want
[2:38:16] <BlueSpartan119> you can replay it as much as you want
[2:38:16] <$joylent_blue> no, you can redo
[2:38:16] <%Estuko> That's SCK
[2:38:16] <ChuckMagnus> Look for red doodles too.
[2:38:17] <+LastHazzerd> Yay, repeat <3
[2:38:19] <+Quinn_Carter> You can do this quest as many times as you like
[2:38:20] <ProfessorLitmus> try to find the lynian researcher for another sidequest
[2:38:21] <Nanomachiner> This is repeatable but for a certain achievement you need to do ALL sidequests in one run
[2:38:22] <%Estuko> that shield is SUPER RAD
[2:38:23] <+BioHunter> dont forget his shield
[2:38:24] <+Aeogard> wait what happened to monster hunter
[2:38:29] <Nanomachiner> Which is a BITCH
[2:38:31] <%Faustgesicht> Replayble endlessly, needs to be
[2:38:32] <Greywolf47> it's repeatable
[2:38:35] <T_Sasquatch> This quest sucks ass tho
[2:38:41] <ittla> is that girl just labrys
[2:38:44] <@commanderclaw> @AngriestPat There's two sidequests, do both for extra shit
[2:38:53] <+jcenderion> @AngriestPat Wouldn't his weapons be drastically ineffective against monster hunter monsters?
[2:38:55] <Sunstalker> AngriestPat Looking at this makes me think Geralt's armor would look so good in Dragons Dogma 2 PogChamp
[2:38:56] <%Zteck123> time for the strongest enemy in the game
[2:39:02] <%terminallyCapriciousz> "Gonna sear--" "OK!" "Gonna look around" "OK!"

[2:41:47] <StarvingPenguinGod> LUL
[2:41:48] <%starotter70> Portals
[2:41:51] <TyrantBelial> The idea that nekkers are opnly hostile hn witcher world cus there's not enough to eat. but in monhun weorld there's too much to eat so they're nearly passive.
[2:41:54] <LeftOverPizza13> straight from soul calibur
[2:41:54] <eanscrale> I guess he took a wrong turn after soul caliber
[2:41:55] <KuroTendouSouji> you can smell the Jyura off of her through the screen
[2:41:55] <+Grayhammatter> LUL
[2:42:03] <+Dingalow> God damn, I can't draw with that voice piercing my hearing holes

[2:42:08] <+Grayhammatter> straight from the soul caliburverse
[2:42:10] <+jcenderion> @AngriestPat "Oh darn those crossover portals, hate those."
[2:42:18] <+EffingMajestic> is she a romance option?
[2:42:21] <+Aeogard> geralt being so tired in every crossover is the best
[2:42:24] <%starotter70> Geralt is stuck in cross over hell
[2:42:26] <VJdarkworld> cant trust portals :|
[2:42:28] <ovan20> @AngriestPat if Geralt says not again, then soul calibur is also cannon on the withcer games Kappa
[2:42:32] <%ItsAbout9000> Everyone is being to nice to Geralt its not normal
[2:42:34] <shinichizio> Now get her card.
[2:42:34] <+jorgamund> I got one big flock monster for ya, gurl Kappa
[2:42:36] <+Double_Tap_That> @EffingMajestic Yes, but you need to catch 20 Downy Crakes first.
[2:42:37] <+Theworld732> Geralt is so tired from all these crossovers
[2:42:42] <%arcaderabbit48> Geralt cant escape from crossing fate
[2:42:42] <T_Sasquatch> Don't say fl*ck

[2:43:09] <DrFaustMD> Man this makes me want to play the Witcher
[2:43:10] <ivansonic08> won't most hunters Fuck up most monsters in The Witcher
[2:43:13] <+Quinn_Carter> One of the sidequests is triggered by exploring the north part of the map and looking for gajalaka doodles.
[2:43:15] <Schuhart> Pat's gotta look at the Gajalaka scrawls to unlock second quest
[2:43:16] <+Double_Tap_That> Handler is at camp 1
[2:43:19] <+Grayhammatter> do you?
[2:43:19] <%Tennochief> you think Geralt would skip out on that 2booty?
[2:43:19] <%SolverCODO> I swear CDprojekt must have been hands-on with this DLC because this FEELS like a Witcher quest. It's written the same way
[2:43:21] <Greywolf47> don't do it yet
[2:43:22] <+Quinn_Carter> Area 7

[2:44:06] <T_Sasquatch> Does pat not know geralts weapon is nearly useless and that he can use other weapons with actual damage
[2:44:07] <+Double_Tap_That> @AngriestPat You can only do one of them if you've done the Gajalaka quest.
[2:44:09] <Sunstalker> Pat, have you seen Warframe's event? LUL

[2:46:31] <%castarts> Majima teaming up for big hunts
[2:46:32] <Schuhart> You need to look at Gajalaka scrawls first!
[2:46:34] <%keyworthe> when's witcher 3 x Yakuza
[2:46:36] <Quilltaz> Geralt isekai into another fantasy world, when's he going to join keanu reeves and fight cyberpunk goths in the big city?
[2:46:37] <+Quinn_Carter> Go to area 6 and 7 and look for doodles.
[2:46:39] <TyrantBelial> Camp 1 then walk to area 6.
[2:46:42] <Schuhart> Red scrawls on trees
[2:46:45] <Kavizimo> Look for scribbles in walls
[2:46:47] <ovan20> @AngriestPat chat is a ficcle creature...sometimes it hits, sometimes it lies through its fucking ass Kappa
[2:46:47] <Archmortal> there's a Gajalaka scrawl close by anyway so it's not bad
[2:46:49] <%Estuko> "Sometimes I dig into the hunter's box while he's away to smell his sweaty clothes."
[2:46:49] <gangste2000> the weapon is just kiryus fist

[2:47:13] <Schuhart> NOW there will be an exclamation point
[2:47:13] <Caidezes> I kinda want a whole game like this, honestly. Geralt dealing with another world and being super tired the entire time.
[2:47:17] <Greywolf47> have you completed the gajalaka quest in main game?
[2:47:19] <%rosemon5001> @T_Sasquatch yea kiryu actually punching that crystal dragon in the face would be cool

[2:54:03] <%arcaderabbit48> I dont know why people are asking why Geralt's weapon should do shit for damage when we have established that he is magic?
[2:54:04] <TyrantBelial> or was that hocus pocus to scare me?
[2:54:10] <+zaworldo> @AngriestPat the lifepowder is for pukei,

[2:56:07] <ashuckel> @AngriestPat ROCK trap above
[2:56:10] <fruit_pie_the_magician> It wouldnt be bad, if you didnt have to help the pukei during it
[2:56:12] <danknugglit> If they put gwent in the gathering hub this would be the best crossover ever
[2:56:12] <Tomschiii> deathmarch is a joke compared to this and extreme leshen
[2:56:15] <%FrogCatapult> I wonder if the combat is better?
[2:56:18] <Thepothero> this is pretty sweet lookin no gonna liev cirOwO

[2:58:01] <%yoshkosh20> it's weird seein geralt get anime punched.
[2:58:02] <+Double_Tap_That> Maybe it's GS time.
[2:58:02] <+alpacasintophats> welp time to boost yourself
[2:58:07] <%dekkitout> Homeboy just planted himself an idiot tree tajC
[2:58:07] <malesin_01> you can switch weapons btw
[2:58:08] <+shaderichter_belmont> damn a witcher on a cart
[2:58:10] <%Kirby_Sauce> @AngriestPat mount and you have jerky for bleed
[2:58:10] <+ComradePenguin> that's not even nearly as hard as the event quest
[2:58:11] <%alcors_wisdom> and thats why its the worst fight in the game
[2:58:11] <Nanomachiner> Honestly I found this easiest with DB
[2:58:11] <Toaster_Noodle> Just got here, is Pat going for the secondary objectives?
[2:58:12] <Schuhart> It is a real fight for sure
[2:58:14] <Tomschiii> better let that hunter on this :D
[2:58:17] <+alpacasintophats> can't his health and stamina go way higher than they are now?
[2:58:18] <J_O9001> GREAT SWORD TIME
[2:58:19] <captainspauldin> this fight is annoying
[2:58:20] <%Zteck123> holy shit, your Iframes aren't worth shit
[2:58:21] <+Quinn_Carter> It's okay to use other weapons, Sword and Shield isn't exactly that good for this fight
[2:58:22] <DublinRage> time to send an SOS XD
[2:58:26] <LoveShack> Ancient Leshan is way worse monkaS
[2:58:29] <Schuhart> @Toaster_Noodle Not really
[2:58:32] <%starotter70> Who's a bigger chad? Geralt or Shepard?
[2:58:36] <Greywolf47> pat doesn't have gajalaka quest done in main game
[2:58:37] <Vigonept> yeah with max potions
[2:58:39] <+alpacasintophats> Geralt
[2:58:46] <professormorrigan> we'll bang ok
[2:58:46] <Quilltaz> femshep
[2:58:47] <Toaster_Noodle> Gotcha, thanks @Schuhart
[2:58:48] <ashuckel> ancient is way easier since you can use a good set
[2:58:48] <%dekkitout> Geralt is like the Meta-Chad
[2:58:50] <Greywolf47> so he can't do gajalaka sidequests here
[2:58:51] <%Kirby_Sauce> use jerky for bleed, mount
[2:58:52] <Vigonept> are there max potions here?
[2:58:57] <bear_breaker20> raise your sheild
[2:58:58] <Axonn1018> So how is this in the Witcher fan perspective? Neat?
[2:59:06] <SiNPylonn> ah yeah that music
[2:59:08] <+Gregmeyer> flash bugs
[2:59:10] <fallacy8> stuns him
[2:59:12] <%Zteck123> stun
[2:59:13] <+alpacasintophats> perhaps shooting it with shit
[2:59:14] <%Kirby_Sauce> shoot it's face
[2:59:14] <+zaworldo> flash
[2:59:14] <%Tearonex> flashesa
[2:59:14] <Kavizimo> @Axonn1018 more challenging than in w3
[2:59:14] <Sunstalker> Because stun Pat
[2:59:17] <Vigonept> flash
[2:59:18] <professormorrigan> Such an impressive crossover, honestly.
[2:59:22] <+KingZaffy> You can interrupt the teleport with Scatternuts or Flash Pods
[2:59:29] <Schuhart> This fight is a bitch
[2:59:29] <BlueSpartan119> easy to flinch with slinger
[2:59:30] <danknugglit> Just spec into igni and burn him to death 4Head
[2:59:31] <Quilltaz> i like that they made the leshen as scary as it should be
[2:59:33] <T_Sasquatch> @axonn1018 its cool as fuck until you realise how annoying it is
[2:59:34] <aero160h> drink ur anti-leshen potion pat lol
[2:59:36] <%golguin1> golguin1 subscribed with Twitch Prime. 
[2:59:50] <+Grayhammatter> nice job stumbo
[3:00:01] <SiNPylonn> get the scatter shot
[3:00:07] <ProfessorLitmus> the leshen is stupid weak to flashpods
[3:00:11] <Toaster_Noodle> They put a lot of work into this one. Almost feels like a real questline @professormorrigan
[3:00:13] <+LastHazzerd> so this thing is essentially a spriggen?
[3:00:14] <brambobelurkin> beat him during the burn Pat
[3:00:18] <asianbowlofriceakalexi> Scatter is more efficient along with flash pods
[3:00:18] <brambobelurkin> its a flinch
[3:00:19] <TyrantBelial> Leshen being poisoned is like "The fck is this bullshit"
[3:00:32] <+KoyaMusa> pat sure does like taking damage
[3:00:34] <verycloudytea> That‚Äôs a giant leshen
[3:00:34] <Archmortal> hit yourself with the ancient potion, you may as well max your shit out
[3:00:40] <%Kirby_Sauce> mount
[3:00:41] <Vigonept> man oats getting fucked
[3:00:47] <%Estuko> apatGib
[3:00:48] <%starotter70> apatGib
[3:00:48] <danknugglit> This is the easy version too
[3:00:51] <%arcaderabbit48> So what is a Leshen, exactly?
[3:00:53] <professormorrigan> Just use Quen :^)
[3:00:59] <asianbowlofriceakalexi> ;-;
[3:01:07] <%golguin1> I got Amazon Prime so now I'm using my Twitch Prime here. What other perks do I have?
[3:01:12] <vinceshamwowslap> üò¢
[3:01:15] <Sunstalker> Pat has not used much SnS :/
[3:01:19] <TalekAetem> It's an Elder Dragon Kappa
[3:01:20] <+LastHazzerd> Sw/Sh actually has some nice lookin moves
[3:01:20] <+alpacasintophats> it drops dragon pods and sling bombs
[3:01:21] <%keyworthe> so. much. work. into this quest
[3:01:21] <$joylent_blue> cuz he's y'know, a dragon
[3:01:24] <ProfessorLitmus> dragon and fire are his weakness
[3:01:24] <%Agami23> revultures are probably affected by elderseal

[3:01:46] <goulguts> i've seen nothing of this game is there spoilers this stream or anything ?
[3:01:52] <BionicPulga> I wish the Leshens were even half as tough as this in the Witcher 3.

[3:02:05] <+alpacasintophats> @goulguts you're fine
[3:02:06] <KeiPrime> spoilers in monster hunter? that would be a first
[3:02:10] <+zaworldo> because magic or whatever
[3:02:16] <%dekkitout> Spoilers and Monster Hunter are mutually exclusive
[3:02:22] <%JohnElwaysTeeth> JohnElwaysTeeth subscribed with Twitch Prime. They've subscribed for 5 months! 
[3:02:22] <+Yosepmeist> does SnS have timing for bonus damage or is that iceborne only?
[3:02:24] <+alpacasintophats> @goulguts only "in the know" references. Not anything to worry about
[3:02:27] <danknugglit> You can mount it
[3:02:42] <goulguts> ok thanks gang
[3:02:45] <Schuhart> Yes
[3:02:45] <%Estuko> only spoilers Ia ctually care about is ingame final monster, thats usually fought in the fortress or huge arena
[3:02:45] <%keyworthe> YES
[3:02:47] <+KingZaffy> You totally can
[3:02:48] <+Gregmeyer> yeah you can
[3:02:48] <+zaworldo> You can mount him
[3:02:49] <LeonSteel> you can
[3:02:49] <@commanderclaw> totally
[3:02:50] <Greywolf47> yup
[3:02:51] <%Kirby_Sauce> YES
[3:02:54] <ProfessorLitmus> yup
[3:02:54] <%Estuko> MH4U had that gogmazios for example, shit was scary and rad
[3:02:54] <Nina96> u can
[3:02:56] <DesuDesuDokiDoki> lewd
[3:02:57] <Schuhart> It's kinda finicky, though
[3:02:57] <%Tearonex> yes you can
[3:03:01] <+KingZaffy> I looks janky as fuck
[3:03:02] <+shaderichter_belmont> yeah but its a bitch
[3:03:05] <bear_breaker20> you can mount anything if youre string enough
[3:03:05] <danknugglit> Yes and its goofy as fuck
[3:03:06] <Tomschiii> man, this makes me want to play mhw and w3 again
[3:03:07] <+LastHazzerd> imagine a Dragons Dogma Crossover
[3:03:08] <Quilltaz> mount him like a stuffed unicorn
[3:03:10] <KeiPrime> what was the big snake that thing was worse
[3:03:12] <KeiPrime> dalamudar?
[3:03:13] <asianbowlofriceakalexi> It‚Äôs a bitch
[3:03:14] <professormorrigan> Witcher is You
[3:03:17] <%Zteck123> it is janky as fuck
[3:03:17] <Toaster_Noodle> Personally, Witcher combat never felt like they had any good difficulty. Any difficulty was artificial or not fun. @BionicPulga
[3:03:20] <brambobelurkin> hated this fight
[3:03:21] <%VantomPayne> LUL
[3:03:24] <+alpacasintophats> wiff king here
[3:03:27] <%Kirby_Sauce> love this fight
[3:03:31] <weontheultralightbeam> SnS has a combo where you can mount in the end
[3:03:35] <+alpacasintophats> he should probably up his stamina
[3:03:39] <Tomschiii> @LastHazzerd Imagine Dragons Dogma?
[3:03:44] <+alpacasintophats> because he won't last a mount with it as is
[3:03:50] <KeiPrime> oh yeah the jump back charge attack goes into a leaping
[3:03:57] <T_Sasquatch> Aren't dragons dogma and this monster Hunter practically the same thing gameplay wise
[3:04:04] <%Kirby_Sauce> why is he doing a full charge?
[3:04:04] <asianbowlofriceakalexi> Denied
[3:04:08] <weontheultralightbeam> LUL
[3:04:12] <Ner234> LUL
[3:04:12] <asianbowlofriceakalexi> He‚Äôs trying to mount
[3:04:15] <KeiPrime> uhmm.. its similar but not quite the same re: dragons dogma and mh
[3:04:15] <asianbowlofriceakalexi> I think
[3:04:18] <%Estuko> @T_Sasquatch kind of...? ish.. hmm been a few years
[3:04:19] <artoflec> dragons dogma is a bit more smokin sexy style and is more class based
[3:04:20] <$joylent_blue> T_Sasquatch ehhhh, kinda
[3:04:27] <%keyworthe> MOUNT MOUNT MOUNT
[3:04:27] <%Estuko> @T_Sasquatch and by few years I mean PS3 LUL
[3:04:43] <Quilltaz> geralt vs a sasquatch, now thats a meeting of two legends
[3:04:48] <Tomschiii> god i want that dragons dogma 2 so bad. i want it so so much
[3:04:51] <%starotter70> This track is great
[3:04:56] <%Kirby_Sauce> cheer500 hey pat, fyi from an SnS main, you don't need to fully charge the launch move
[3:04:57] <shoobieredgrave> So is Milla Jovovich gonna show up in the Witcher netflix show?
[3:04:59] <%arcaderabbit48> POOF!
[3:05:00] <Archmortal> you want your health/stam at max for this next part so you can worry about other things

[3:05:16] <KeiPrime> milla jovovich AND 2B
[3:05:16] <asianbowlofriceakalexi> Get your stamina up it will help
[3:05:18] <KeiPrime> sticc vs thicc
[3:05:20] <+alpacasintophats> @ProfessorLitmus he has the powder
[3:05:21] <BootyFriend> Does Pat know about the atk gem subquest for this?
[3:05:24] <T_Sasquatch> @estuko i own Dragon's dogma on ps3 and ps4 üòÇ. I've barely progressed
[3:05:26] <%Kirby_Sauce> Eat
[3:05:34] <asianbowlofriceakalexi> Please up stamina
[3:05:40] <%Estuko> @T_Sasquatch I got through main story like twice... and beat Dark Arisen
[3:05:51] <Tomschiii> a monster hunter manga/anime that is actually dark and bloody would be so cool.
[3:05:55] <+zaworldo> e a t f o o d
[3:05:58] <+KingZaffy> @AngriestPat Keeping one Jagras alive stops him from summoning more.
[3:06:03] <TalekAetem> ^
[3:06:05] <Archmortal> your health isn't at max either
[3:06:23] <%Estuko> LUL that jagras about to fucking fight Leshen
[3:06:23] <Heartless_01> nom nom nom
[3:06:24] <%SolverCODO> NOM NOM
[3:06:24] <bear_breaker20> @Tomschiii lol no, tats more inline with dogma, mohuns always been lighthearted
[3:06:26] <T_Sasquatch> Who DOESN'T LOVE ADDS
[3:06:26] <%Estuko> he's the real hero
[3:06:26] <brambobelurkin> here it is
[3:06:27] <Archmortal> use the ancient potion you coward, it's not from your item stock
[3:06:32] <ProfessorLitmus> wigglie leechi
[3:06:35] <%Tennochief> @Tomschiii it ain't monster hunter, but Genndy is making a new show called Primal about a caveman and a dinosaur, and it's super cool and bloody
[3:06:37] <T_Sasquatch> Fuck this quest LUL
[3:06:40] <brambobelurkin> now hes beginning to understand our hatred
[3:06:41] <%Estuko> @Tomschiii hardly, monhun isn't really a dark game.
[3:06:43] <%arcaderabbit48> Right. I remember that fun "mechanic"
[3:06:45] <brambobelurkin> taste the salt
[3:06:46] <asianbowlofriceakalexi> Kill the jagras but leave one so he doesn‚Äôt summon anymore
[3:06:49] <danknugglit> Red eye jaggy
[3:06:54] <Vigonept> Just kill it super ez
[3:06:54] <%Estuko> @Tennochief I watched that trailer like 10 times lmfao
[3:06:56] <RavenHellkite> the tempered one is a big fuck no LUL
[3:07:01] <Tomschiii> @bear_breaker20 thats why i said manga or anime. to see monhun in a different light would make it so much better
[3:07:04] <+LastHazzerd> punching monsters
[3:07:08] <%Maids4lyfe> igni
[3:07:09] <Schuhart> You can IGNI them
[3:07:13] <%Kirby_Sauce> igni
[3:07:15] <KriegorChat> I remember it taking like 20 tries to get the damn pukei to survive
[3:07:17] <asianbowlofriceakalexi> Igni
[3:07:20] <bear_breaker20> then it wouldnt be monster hunter
[3:07:21] <+LastHazzerd> i wish there was a fist weapon
[3:07:21] <+shaderichter_belmont> Geralt showing off his skills as the boxing champion of Velen
[3:07:23] <danknugglit> Fire is hot
[3:07:24] <%Tennochief> @Estuko that nose bite kill is metal af
[3:07:31] <BionicPulga> Lol
[3:07:31] <Tomschiii> @Estuko you can make dark things out of anything that isnt dark :)
[3:07:36] <RavenHellkite> i got puki to survive on my first try i was lucky
[3:07:36] <Greywolf47> PogChamp
[3:07:39] <asianbowlofriceakalexi> Have fun
[3:07:45] <%Estuko> @Tennochief the caveman digging the dagger into that dino's head several times was awesome
[3:07:48] <+Oktulp21 > Man Witcher 3 has really good music
[3:07:50] <%Tennochief> @Tomschiii ***
[3:07:56] <TalekAetem> Good damage!
[3:07:56] <%Estuko> @Tomschiii doesn't mean it'll improve it. In this case, at all
[3:08:02] <bear_breaker20> @Tennochief whats that comic called ?
[3:08:19] <%Kirby_Sauce> i gotta go back an finish witcher 3...
[3:08:20] <+LastHazzerd> that is a sharp sword
[3:08:21] <Schuhart> Just a little sippy sips
[3:08:28] <%starotter70> Don't mind me
[3:08:30] <%Tennochief> @bear_breaker20 which comic?
[3:08:37] <Tomschiii> @Estuko the thought of it alone makes it pretty cool. where the fights, encounters etc. are serious and a big deal.
[3:08:43] <%SolverCODO> @Kirby_Sauce be sure to do the Blood and Wine DLC too it's the best
[3:08:44] <%arcaderabbit48> What if we took the thing that wasn't gorey and edgey, and made it gorey and edgey?
[3:08:45] <asianbowlofriceakalexi> Kill Jagras except one so he won‚Äôt summon anymore of them
[3:08:47] <danknugglit> Witcher 3 has amazing dlc too
[3:08:55] <+alpacasintophats> eat a max potion
[3:09:01] <ProfessorLitmus> time for the hardest part
[3:09:07] <mr_slaide> With the glass bottle and all!
[3:09:10] <%JohnElwaysTeeth> i just started watching, did he get the puki earlier?
[3:09:12] <bear_breaker20> you said a genndy persons is making one and im assumming theyve worked on monhun? @Tennochief
[3:09:12] <RavenHellkite> witcher 3 dlc is like new games
[3:09:14] <+KingZaffy> Semi-final phase
[3:09:26] <%Estuko> @Tomschiii they are already a big deal as it is, environmental destruction and ecosystems potentially being ended is the purpose of hunting monsters
[3:09:28] <+LastHazzerd> SHAAAAAAAAaaa
[3:09:29] <TheHotStuven> still 1 more
[3:09:39] <%Kirby_Sauce> @mr_slaide what? this part is easy! tons of ledges, a tree to wrap him in
[3:09:40] <%arcaderabbit48> La-HEE
[3:09:56] <+trueoni> is this a mod or
[3:09:57] <T_Sasquatch> @bear_breaker20 gendy tarkovsky made samurai jack
[3:10:03] <%Estuko> @trueoni no LUL an event
[3:10:05] <+LastHazzerd> Cross over event
[3:10:08] <asianbowlofriceakalexi> No it‚Äôs not a mod... ;-;
[3:10:08] <+Oktulp21 > I remember seeing a meme that was like ‚Äúwhy buy a new $25 power armor skin in F76 when you can buy Blood & Wine got cheaper than that‚Äù and I was like shit
[3:10:09] <RavenHellkite> no la hee in this house
[3:10:09] <%Kirby_Sauce> @trueoni evet
[3:10:13] <asianbowlofriceakalexi> Crossover
[3:10:15] <Tomschiii> @Estuko all this is completly irrelevant in the games
[3:10:18] <+LastHazzerd> is this a limited time run or available whenever?
[3:10:24] <%Tennochief> @bear_breaker20 Ah I see, Genndy Taratokovsky (creator of Samurao Jack) is making a new cartoon called "Primal", about the journey of a caveman and a dinosaur through prehistoric times. Genndy has nothing to do with Monster Hunter
[3:10:31] <T_Sasquatch> Can you imagine there's no samurai jack game
[3:10:36] <TheHotStuven> the story version is always playable
[3:10:40] <+Quinn_Carter> Time to Max Potion
[3:10:45] <TheHotStuven> the hard real version is event-limited
[3:10:50] <Verboseobserver> imagine the work it would take to make just the fight as a mod
[3:10:51] <asianbowlofriceakalexi> H E A L
[3:10:52] <+trueoni> @Estuko jesus i knew about the gerald armor but didnt know it brought a monster in atpRtsd
[3:11:07] <+LastHazzerd> dizzy
[3:11:09] <bear_breaker20> oh lol that genndy, will have to look it up man does good work @Tennochief
[3:11:12] <RavenHellkite> it's such an annoying fight and the tempered fight is even worse
[3:11:14] <BionicPulga> "Wind's howling"
[3:11:20] <+AWr00tBear> Why is Pat such a baby about Radial menus?
[3:11:22] <ProfessorLitmus> finally
[3:11:28] <+LastHazzerd> *running away* "How ya like that silver!?"
[3:11:31] <%Tennochief> @bear_breaker20 you should, it's great ***
[3:11:32] <%arcaderabbit48> I feel like having more people around would help considerably in a fight like this
[3:11:33] <RavenHellkite> i never did the tempered i wanted ciri FeelsBadMan
[3:11:34] <asianbowlofriceakalexi> AYYY HE DRANK IT
[3:11:35] <+Oktulp21 > ‚ÄúPlace of Power, it‚Äôs gotta be‚Äù
[3:11:38] <+KoyaMusa> why pat bad at game
[3:11:44] <Vigonept> I dont like radial menus cause it prevents me from turning my camera
[3:11:49] <%Estuko> @Tomschiii still don't think it'd be beneficial to the anime/manga you're wishing it'd become.ya know
[3:11:51] <%Dualities> Dualities subscribed with Twitch Prime. They've subscribed for 3 months! Thanks for all the entertainment dude!
[3:11:56] <TheHotStuven> the real fight is the biggest pain to solo, especially when learning
[3:11:58] <Archmortal> I only use the radial menu for the whetstone and gestures
[3:11:58] <Greywolf47> same vigon
[3:12:09] <%WackyGear> stab it in the face
[3:12:14] <asianbowlofriceakalexi> @vigonept Same honestly
[3:12:18] <TalekAetem> Break da horns
[3:12:20] <+LastHazzerd> yay broken parts!
[3:12:22] <bear_breaker20> radial menus also make the player veer the camera when choosing a option sometimes and that suckssss
[3:12:23] <+Quinn_Carter> HERE COMES THE BEST PART
[3:12:26] <GamerWorlock> that's not true you can use claw grip
[3:12:26] <RavenHellkite> big crits
[3:12:27] <%Estuko> @Archmortal I spent a chunk of time trying to get ascreen shot where I killed a rathalos with the fucking hadouken LUL
[3:12:28] <Sunstalker> did Pat just not time his mounted hits? :/
[3:12:39] <bear_breaker20> claw grip sucksss
[3:12:40] <@CreepyPorpoise> CreepyPorpoise subscribed with Twitch Prime. They've subscribed for 4 months! 
[3:12:45] <BlueSpartan119> inb4 "Quest Failed"
[3:12:46] <+Zulos77> radial menus are way faster so who cares about turning the camera during it
[3:12:50] <+LastHazzerd> ther'es timing to mounted hits?
[3:12:52] <ProfessorLitmus> time to heal the baby
[3:12:53] <Greywolf47> pat ain't gonna do the next with side quest completed
[3:12:56] <@CreepyPorpoise> !uptime
[3:12:56] <@Moobot> I've been playing this game for how long? Oh only 3h 12m.
[3:13:03] <+zaworldo> Heal da baby
[3:13:07] <Schuhart> Pukei-Chan!
[3:13:19] <%arcaderabbit48> Would Monster Hunter be improved if they had visible health bars? Cause sometimes it feels like I'm beating in to these monsters forever with no clear sense of progress
[3:13:22] <Sunstalker> LastHazzerd Yeah, SnS has a mechanic where you can get way more hits in and extend mounts very long
[3:13:31] <TheHotStuven> Pukei!
[3:13:32] <+LastHazzerd> did he get life powder?
[3:13:32] <%Estuko> @arcaderabbit48 nope, you can if you want to graba mod for it
[3:13:32] <+trueoni> what weapon type is thjat?
[3:13:34] <%MagickBurritoh> YEYEYE

[3:13:56] <$joylent_blue> arcaderabbit48 part of the charm is having to learn what a monsters tells are, panting, limping, stuff like that
[3:13:56] <+Zulos77> @arcaderabbit48 there is the resident evil health bar next to the minimap that shows when they are low on health

[3:14:58] <Tomschiii> @Estuko i still cant see why not. to bring monhun, the goofy title into a different light or feel. there is only a thing to gain but nothing to lose. lore elemnts could be brought in or be new etc.
[3:15:04] <Mortal_Wombat_I> Protect the Pukei...
[3:15:06] <Escherite> holy cock jagras, eat a bowl of dick
[3:15:17] <%Tennochief> thanks Pukei
[3:15:19] <asianbowlofriceakalexi> Poor Pukei.... ;-;
[3:15:21] <Caidezes> RIP
[3:15:25] <Vigonept> use life powders pat
[3:15:27] <+MrMcCrabby> tfw pukei is weaker than a bunch of jagras
[3:15:28] <$joylent_blue> escort mission DansGame
[3:15:36] <+zaworldo> nO MORE life powders
[3:15:36] <%Estuko> @Tomschiii the game has lore as it is, such as past civilizations being completely wiped out by one of the elder dragons you eventually encounter in the past games
[3:15:39] <%GarbageNirvana> Pat confirmed x Tekken player
[3:15:44] <bear_breaker20> @Tomschiii the thin to lose is the innocence monhun has in my heart
[3:15:44] <+zaworldo> gotta do it perfect
[3:16:08] <+LastHazzerd> jump slash!
[3:16:14] <%arcaderabbit48> @Tomschiii I dunno, turning goofy stuff into something darker and gorier is usually a huge turn off for most people. Like all those crappy pokemon fangames that proclaim a "mature" storyline, but are really just depressing, edgey nonsense. Or how DmC completely lost the tone of the original series.
[3:16:14] <Tomschiii> @Estuko exactly, and that could be inplimented and structured out

[3:20:49] <%arcaderabbit48> So does Arch Tempered summon up a bunch of Great Jagras? Cause that would be hilarious
[3:20:51] <ProfessorLitmus> no pukei or gaja endings for Pat
[3:20:51] <asianbowlofriceakalexi> Wasn‚Äôt worth the death of a Pukei
[3:20:52] <Greywolf47> no extra cutscene for pat
[3:20:52] <%Zteck123> it wasn't and never will be
[3:20:53] <bear_breaker20> that pukei saw you pat
[3:20:53] <%JohnElwaysTeeth> if you want to save the pukie outside of just abusing jump attacks your best bet is to not mount until pukei shows up
[3:20:54] <Nina96> bug?
[3:20:54] <%keyworthe> weird the text bugged out
[3:20:54] <Psyramics> good item

[3:20:57] <+KoyaMusa> no you didn't

[3:21:06] <ProfessorLitmus> no you didn't pat
[3:21:07] <%lizard0tm> YOU FAILED
[3:21:07] <+jkobe34> if you fight the event leshen you can also get ciri's swords and armor
[3:21:12] <+SickBangerzM9> is this pc with ps buttons mod?
[3:21:13] <Schuhart> @AngriestPat Doing this quest again with all the dialogue for the 100% is a chore and not something you'd want to stream. if you want those rewards, do it off-stream.
[3:21:15] <asianbowlofriceakalexi> Not worth the death of our baby Pukei ;-;
[3:21:16] <+Grayhammatter> pukei dead though
[3:21:20] <+Gregmeyer> there is a cutscene for both sidequests
[3:21:23] <BlueLunecy> Fake gamer
[3:21:23] <+KingZaffy> There's extra cutscenes for clearing both side quests, on top of the extra rewards.
[3:21:24] <%Puhff> You achieved nothing
[3:21:24] <TyrantBelial> but you didn't though the pukei died and tyou need gajalaka doodles
[3:21:25] <+alpacasintophats> that check in the top corner is for D RANK
[3:21:25] <%Tennochief> you guys got the twitch lg too?
[3:21:25] <mayorrev> @angriestpat so what's the reward for doing this Witcher crossover
[3:21:27] <mr_slaide> Did you? Did you really?
[3:21:28] <bear_breaker20> the real friends were the pukeis we killed along the way

[3:21:43] <%logoth_> Handler wants to taste Geralt's silver.
[3:21:43] <WeebFever> but you totally could've
[3:21:43] <Greywolf47> you get 2 extra cutscenes for sidequest competition @angriestpat
[3:21:45] <SilverFaustX> @AngriestPat the stream is lagging alot
[3:21:51] <$joylent_blue> why do they let her talk
[3:21:52] <%Gogogolem> I am surprised geralt hasn't boned half these people yet
[3:21:53] <+DZiffer> they totally fucked
[3:21:54] <%arcaderabbit48> Its funny that people care so much about a monster we kill 50 of, specifically when its something else killing it. I wonder why that is? Because a reward is attached?
[3:21:57] <+zaworldo> @SilverFaustX it's you man

[3:25:45] <+alpacasintophats> you can also make the swords
[3:25:51] <Railgun5> @AngriestPat The leshen mats are unnamed because of a shoplist mod you have installed
[3:25:54] <+MrMcCrabby> geralt's sword is good but you need ancient leshen to upgrade it
[3:25:56] <+alpacasintophats> behemoth
[3:25:56] <Verboseobserver> Hey Pat, small detail but if you talk to the handler during the quest they talk about how the hunter is soloing all the other monsters in the forest to keep it clear for Gerolt

[3:27:51] <%dekkitout> Let him eat the hair, cmon maaaan~
[3:27:51] <+MrMcCrabby> you can cast igni using the emote
[3:27:54] <%Kirby_Sauce> it's cool
[3:27:59] <WeebFever> Are you going to do behemoth eventually or is it 100% giga-coward for eternity?
[3:28:03] <JetpackMcQuack> Eat the hair elmo is tasty
[3:28:08] <ChuckMagnus> Kirin's just gonna kick that rock outta your dumb hand.
[3:28:11] <ScreamLord> Behemoth armor is super busted. I hope they don't make that mistake again for the Iceborne meta
[3:28:14] <%Kirby_Sauce> gets powered up with witcher armour
[3:28:15] <BlueSpartan119> Igni can also be used as an emote
[3:28:17] <LeftOverPizza13> infinite use, i imagine
[3:28:20] <+zaworldo> Pat too scared for behemoth
[3:28:24] <+Quinn_Carter> Is Pat just in a private session?
[3:28:27] <GamerWorlock> Just doing the emote saves you from using the item space
[3:28:35] <%starotter70> If Paige was truely Elmo's mother she would eat his hair
[3:28:36] <mr_slaide> EMloooooooooooo!
[3:28:39] <ScreamLord> The Baby!

[3:28:57] <+theactualjimbo> HUG THAT CAT
[3:28:58] <%JohnElwaysTeeth> they're nerfing max might and weakness exploit pretty hard in iceborn, won't be able to hit 100% affinity on every weapon anymore
[3:29:05] <+Grayhammatter> he hasn't been buttering his mother
[3:29:08] <JetpackMcQuack> Tasty hair
[3:29:10] <%Piemen99> buttering?
[3:29:11] <ZazzyDoesStuff> why would he be Buttering his Mom?
[3:29:12] <mr_slaide> Oh, they're nerfing weakness exploit?
[3:29:23] <ScreamLord> Sucks that I missed 3 hours of this stream
[3:29:29] <mr_slaide> DAaaaayyyuuuuum
[3:29:31] <%Tennochief> fuck
[3:29:32] <StrawberryBandit> yay build variety
[3:29:33] <GamerWorlock> max might is dead
[3:29:34] <%JohnElwaysTeeth> you have to soften the monster to get the full numbers
[3:29:34] <+Grayhammatter> oof, but needed
[3:29:39] <mr_slaide> It's pretty damn good.
[3:29:39] <Nautilus_Bot> why, how
[3:29:40] <HUNTERX2X> build variety is good
[3:29:40] <ScreamLord> Max Might is gonna become basically useless
[3:29:43] <+theactualjimbo> Good, it's way too easy to get
[3:29:43] <+MrMcCrabby> weakness exploit didnt even get hit that hard, max might got fucked
[3:29:44] <bear_breaker20> make monsters tough again
[3:29:44] <%dekkitout> Isn't elemental damage getting a buff?
[3:29:45] <+Grayhammatter> NICE jorb
[3:29:45] <asianbowlofriceakalexi> Theeeeere goes my builds
[3:29:45] <+demon_shadowplays> @AngriestPat I missed the ffvii stream yesterday. Any plans in streaming it more? or was it a one time deal?
[3:29:49] <+SweatyMercury> nooooo my bow builds :(
[3:29:53] <%JohnElwaysTeeth> they're buffin crit eye pretty good tho, needing to hit 7 will be rough
[3:29:55] <%Tennochief> FUCK
[3:29:57] <asianbowlofriceakalexi> @sweatymercury Sameeeee
[3:29:59] <+MetalMeltdown31> It's a fair nerf, but the max might one is overkill if the leaks are correct.
[3:30:01] <+KoyaMusa> don't worry, your group will carry you anyways so mantel is no problem
[3:30:03] <+Quinn_Carter> Can confirm I use Weakness Exploit on everything.
[3:30:06] <asianbowlofriceakalexi> Damn I have to change literally EVERY BUILD
[3:30:10] <mr_slaide> But other builds ARE viable. Crit is just better.
[3:30:18] <+TheIntellectional> laughs in charge blade
[3:30:23] <Nautilus_Bot> is crit draw good on anythung other than bow dragon piercer?
[3:30:23] <HUNTERX2X> it would be better to see better buffs for full sets, even tho the core system does not support that
[3:30:23] <mr_slaide> Everyone will now go to a max ATK meta.
[3:30:23] <KriegorChat> Since when does viability matter in a monster hunter game LUL
[3:30:25] <+SweatyMercury> But i want to kill everything in the game in 2 minutes
[3:30:26] <+Quinn_Carter> I can't wait to have an excuse to use evade extender and evade plus.
[3:30:28] <asianbowlofriceakalexi> F
[3:30:30] <brambobelurkin> how hatd is weakness exploit being hit?
[3:30:31] <+Grayhammatter> listen to your friends
[3:30:32] <%JohnElwaysTeeth> level 7 crit eye will be 40% now
[3:30:33] <+ComradePenguin> but i want to run a crit bow build all the time
[3:30:33] <Tomschiii> i pretty much got only stuff for evasion. nothing to boost dmg
[3:30:35] <%Zteck123> he at the top, coming down
[3:30:36] <brambobelurkin> hard*
[3:30:45] <asianbowlofriceakalexi> How‚Äôs it being nerfed though?
[3:30:49] <GamerWorlock> weak exploit still at %50 if you weaken the monster with the new mount attac
[3:30:49] <HUNTERX2X> evade lance lets go
[3:30:50] <+babzidu45> Is this AT Kirin?
[3:30:53] <ProfessorLitmus> you dont make things more viable by bringing down the best, you do it by raising up the stuff that sucks to match\
[3:30:54] <ScreamLord> The Behemoth armor was design around Attack Boost and Crits, so it'll be hit hard by this
[3:30:59] <+MrMcCrabby> evade skills are already good its just people git gud and use damage skills instead
[3:30:59] <StrawberryBandit> maybe it'll encourage people to use defensive skills more and fail quests less
[3:30:59] <bear_breaker20> laughs in *knowing the mons attack pattern*
[3:31:03] <%JohnElwaysTeeth> weakness exploit will max at 30% affinity on non soften parts
[3:31:03] <+Grayhammatter> nice whiff
[3:31:11] <+KaosMachina> MURDER THE MURDERHORSE
[3:31:14] <%Zteck123> look at all these big brains using long ranged weapons
[3:31:15] <%JohnElwaysTeeth> max might will need to have you stamina full for 6-7 seconds before it kicks in
[3:31:20] <mayorrev> is that a fuckin unicorn?
[3:31:20] <ChuckMagnus> I kinda just wanna use the wacky waving arm flailing inflatable tube-palico.
[3:31:21] <%Tennochief> Fucking Karen
[3:31:23] <+Grayhammatter> everybody shooting him except pat LUL
[3:31:23] <+MrMcCrabby> people still won't use defensive skills, if they arent using it now
[3:31:26] <bear_breaker20> i like the horse....
[3:31:26] <Mrthepastyrider> Kiran is a strong aesthetic tho
[3:31:29] <brambobelurkin> thats fine with me still makes my crit set 100%
[3:31:30] <StrawberryBandit> I don't mind Kirin tbh. As long as I use hammer
[3:31:31] <%Gogogolem> No body will take you to Prom kirin
[3:31:31] <%Tennochief> Karen the Kirin
[3:31:34] <HUNTERX2X> nobody likes the horse
[3:31:39] <malesin_01> you think weakness exploit was nerfed, they straight up murdered maximum might
[3:31:41] <mayorrev> I like horse!
[3:31:44] <godlesscruelty> i llike Kirin
[3:31:45] <tournadokai> I don‚Äôt think great sword is good against Kirin
[3:31:54] <StrawberryBandit> it is if you can hit the horn
[3:31:56] <Supathief> Is Pat not running Focus on his set?
[3:31:57] <brambobelurkin> Can we talk about offensive counter though?
[3:31:58] <+AGRO_91> it shows monster weaknesses on the icon now?
[3:32:00] <brambobelurkin> for lances?
[3:32:03] <HUNTERX2X> horse sucks and everyone who likes him just like his stripper armor
[3:32:05] <%Tennochief> that's a mod
[3:32:14] <%JohnElwaysTeeth> i'm sure you will still be able to hit 100%, but it won't be with every weapon like it was before, like super negative base weapons i.e d-jo and blos
[3:32:17] <+KoyaMusa> wiff master boivin at it again
[3:32:25] <+Quinn_Carter> Can confirm, stripper armor is some spicy armor
[3:32:25] <ScreamLord> GS, GL, and Lance kinda suck against Kirin
[3:32:39] <weontheultralightbeam> GS is actually kinda good for kirin
[3:32:49] <asianbowlofriceakalexi> @quinn_carter Protects all vitals üëå
[3:32:54] <Supathief> GS is great aganins Kirin what?
[3:32:57] <HUNTERX2X> damage-wise, it ain't fun with GL but it u shell solo, it's a very fast fight
[3:33:00] <bear_breaker20> lance is amazing against all monsters
[3:33:01] <Tomschiii> i just hope the iceborne armor sets for females are actually ARMOR and nothing where the stomach is naked or crap like that
[3:33:03] <Toaster_Noodle> GS is good if you know Kirin's pattern
[3:33:03] <brambobelurkin> @JohnElwaysTeeth True. Personally I care mostly for my Odogg crit masters touch set. So as long as my baby is good Im happy
[3:33:05] <StrawberryBandit> nice
[3:33:11] <weontheultralightbeam> i mean you can just hit once and leave and rinse and repeat
[3:33:12] <Aydarkzero> BIG damage
[3:33:15] <weontheultralightbeam> its pretty safe
[3:33:18] <%Tennochief> is that a HBG or LBG?
[3:33:19] <mr_slaide> DED
[3:33:19] <LeftOverPizza13> ! Once Again !
[3:33:23] <StrawberryBandit> LBG
[3:33:25] <%walternatorz> wut
[3:33:26] <ScreamLord> @AngriestPat If you plan on hunting AT Lavashits Igni is good because it heats up and softens his lava armor
[3:33:26] <%Tennochief> thanks
[3:33:27] <TalekAetem> Now do AT Kirin
[3:33:28] <Toltage> One limpy boy
[3:33:28] <+MrMcCrabby> wait is this arch tempered
[3:33:30] <+zaworldo> this feels wrong
[3:33:30] <+Grayhammatter> the only big damage is those bowguns and bow
[3:33:31] <%Estuko> @Tomschiii there's plenty of full cover armour, but also guys have that too lol
[3:33:35] <+MrMcCrabby> oh its not
[3:33:38] <+MetalMeltdown31> It's two LBGs.
[3:33:41] <SilverSnake55> Is that tempered regular or are they helping out someone's 49HR
[3:33:42] <%starotter70> SHOCKER!
[3:33:44] <mr_slaide> Nah, it's pussy Kirin.
[3:33:50] <Supathief> GS is not *fun* against Kirin. But it's actually one of the better weapons to run against it.
[3:34:00] <%dekkitout> I'll chase you to the ends of the Earth!
[3:34:02] <Aydarkzero> i just need a tiny Kirin to get all the monster sizes FeelsBadMan
[3:34:06] <+MrMcCrabby> GS is super fun against kirin
[3:34:08] <StrawberryBandit> Hammer against Kirin or bust
[3:34:10] <HUNTERX2X> bad place to stop it
[3:34:10] <weontheultralightbeam> hammer fucks kirin up tho if youre fighting in a slope
[3:34:18] <%Tennochief> yay
[3:34:22] <Tomschiii> @Estuko plenty, yes, but everything should be full cover and i hope iceborne gets it right (dont want to see the footage of the new stuff)
[3:34:24] <+MetalMeltdown31> Hammer is also my preferred Kirin killer.
[3:34:25] <%Estuko> @Tomschiii and I mean in the iceborne, newer armour has knightly full cover aesthetics
[3:34:25] <mr_slaide> I like hammer and lance on Kirin. Lance upstab hits the horn easily.
[3:34:33] <Kisiel250> Was this tempered Kirin?
[3:34:33] <%dekkitout> Dumb Horsey: Ded
[3:34:34] <%GalacticLatte> Does Pat have a list of mods that he's using?
[3:34:38] <%JohnElwaysTeeth> fire bow god tier on kirin
[3:34:38] <Nina96> more than teo?
[3:34:41] <+Noni321> Hardest monster to hunt for you personally?
[3:34:42] <%Estuko> @Tomschiii why should everything be full cover? I like seeing parts of my hunter
[3:34:48] <malesin_01> you seem to hate all endgame monsters
[3:35:00] <%Kirby_Sauce> i like sns on kirin cause i get to be a shining knight on an electric party
[3:35:00] <ScreamLord> @AngriestPat Igni is good for AT Lavashits because it softens his lava armor.
[3:35:01] <+Quinn_Carter> Hardest is Behemoth
[3:35:04] <@commanderclaw> For me it's Kusha
[3:35:05] <StrawberryBandit> Luna imo I think. Outside of Behemoth and Leshen
[3:35:05] <rasug> fight extreme behemoth B)
[3:35:13] <Supathief> Can ya flash your skills on your set when ya get the chance? @AngriestPat
[3:35:13] <+Grayhammatter> dora?
[3:35:14] <StrawberryBandit> Nergi wraxuMelt
[3:35:17] <+MrMcCrabby> pat do at nergi
[3:35:18] <Klarrann3> just use hammer on Kirin for an easy fight
[3:35:18] <%Kirby_Sauce> @commanderclaw kusha is a good one.
[3:35:19] <LeonSteel> FUCK KUSHALA
[3:35:19] <+Noni321> You love AT Nerg?
[3:35:20] <brambobelurkin> Nerg is based
[3:35:21] <Nautilus_Bot> HATE Kush
[3:35:21] <%Tennochief> you like Kuhala?
[3:35:22] <brambobelurkin> new favorite
[3:35:24] <+Zulos77> you wont like nergi after the AT fight
[3:35:24] <Aydarkzero> Nerg is a cool fight
[3:35:26] <mr_slaide> Lunastra is an asshole.
[3:35:30] <bxdragon> Luna and Kirin for normal monsters. Behe is just bullshit.
[3:35:31] <%SolverCODO> Pat's armor looks like Lucatiel's from DKS2
[3:35:31] <Aydarkzero> Teo and Luna can fuck right off
[3:35:33] <%Zteck123> Nergi-Dante?
[3:35:33] <Kisiel250> Kushala "Can't Touch This" Daora
[3:35:33] <asianbowlofriceakalexi> Kusha is a pain in the ass
[3:35:34] <%HiroTSK5> Xeno's my favorite
[3:35:35] <@commanderclaw> Teostra is easy with hammer
[3:35:37] <Tomschiii> @Estuko it looks cheap and its annoying to have female armor that is....well, not armor but a bikini. i HATE that trend, i HATE it
[3:35:39] <Toaster_Noodle> I never have met someone who personally likes Kushala
[3:35:39] <%Kirby_Sauce> @LeonSteel what's wrong with kushala?
[3:35:40] <+Grayhammatter> nergi-dante
[3:35:42] <ProfessorLitmus> tempered nergi is a bit too much on his damage output I think
[3:35:42] <StrawberryBandit> @Zulos77 I soloed it B) pretty easy with some practice
[3:35:43] <%dekkitout> The only kind of good kush is green- and boi, that dragon aint greem
[3:35:44] <fantom_flasch> Just beat tempered Kirin yesterday with greatsword. I had so much trouble before but I went slow and steady and it was good.
[3:35:47] <%GyroBrando> I kinda hate vaal hazak
[3:35:47] <Nautilus_Bot> Astalos is so rad
[3:35:50] <gallohuegos> Valstrax
[3:35:54] <Skeletonmanners> you like Kirin?
[3:35:55] <brambobelurkin> Val and Teo > Daora
[3:36:00] <$eldrich_horror> just beat my first AT lunastra solo. proub of myself
[3:36:01] <+MetalMeltdown31> I like Vaal. He's a big ol' punching bag for Charge Blade.
[3:36:01] <T_Sasquatch> Teostra is a Nekker
[3:36:03] <ScreamLord> Luna is a fucking bitch. And AT Luna is the worst
[3:36:05] <+SweatyMercury> Vaal sux, too slow
[3:36:05] <fantom_flasch> Slow and steady with mantles
[3:36:09] <SilverFaustX> vaal hazak armor is best
[3:36:13] <+Zulos77> @StrawberryBandit its easy to solo, i use GL and shoot him a bunch but he has BS moves
[3:36:13] <+KoyaMusa> are you sure you won't give up hard
[3:36:16] <WeebFever> when behemoth you COWARD
[3:36:17] <Nina96> full playthorugh?
[3:36:20] <%Estuko> @Tomschiii men also have revealing armour as well in those cases. it's with the style of the monster's aesthetic
[3:36:21] <+TunakIn> FULLPLAYTROUGH ONE SITTING
[3:36:22] <%starotter70> 1 or 2 times a week?
[3:36:24] <rasug> what about extreme behemoth B)
[3:36:25] <mr_slaide> Plague, damn it.
[3:36:26] <LeonSteel> @kirby_sauce, his fucking wind aura is infuriating
[3:36:26] <StrawberryBandit> @Zulos77 Absolutely. It's scary when the mantles are down LUL
[3:36:29] <+polypolipauli> STAR TRAK!!!
[3:36:29] <%JohnElwaysTeeth> thanks for introducing me to this game pat, i've dumped over 400 hours into it and has become one of my all time favorites
[3:36:33] <%badchoice5> Oh hey, made it back just in time to hit the end of the stream
[3:36:39] <asianbowlofriceakalexi> Behemoth....
[3:36:40] <%HiroTSK5> Kind of a long game
[3:36:45] <Nina96> btw y it so dark? @AngriestPat
[3:36:45] <Dementedpenguin> I gotta have more Clumbo, baby.
[3:36:45] <mr_slaide> No Behemoth for you.
[3:36:46] <%starotter70> Aight
[3:36:46] <%HRDSalami654> You see the new tactical alert in Warframe?
[3:36:47] <asianbowlofriceakalexi> Why don‚Äôt you wanna go against it...?
[3:36:47] <+Zulos77> @StrawberryBandit and the chip damage when you guard is crazy high lol
[3:36:55] <Tomschiii> @Estuko i didnt see that many tbh.
[3:36:59] <ProfessorLitmus> you gonna get the prettiest dress for cloud?
[3:36:59] <%HRDSalami654> It's so stupid.

[3:37:16] <%SolverCODO> @AngriestPat please learn how to pilot the ship and move in Outer Wilds before streaming oh god
[3:37:20] <%Agami23> @AngriestPat so why did you stream so early today?
[3:37:30] <+Zulos77> @StrawberryBandit noice, i love hammer but never used it for him
[3:37:36] <Tomschiii> started the outer wilds yesterday and i dont understand shit
[3:37:37] <%Estuko> @Tomschiii mhw doesn't have as huge a selection as the previous games, but that's how it's been for quite a number of years. and the revealing sexy sets are quite rare.
[3:37:39] <StrawberryBandit> @Zulos77 Very much recommend it SeemsGood
[3:37:41] <%starotter70> Pat got cucked, he couldn't suck that dick
[3:37:42] <mr_slaide> Hammer is great.
[3:37:42] <indig0bird> I missed, I hoped to see the start of FF7
[3:37:45] <FrostyKaze> what are your favourite monsters from monster hunter?

[3:37:56] <Tubit> As an European I demand more bones!
[3:37:56] <mr_slaide> Pat is mad he can't suck CLaude's dick.
[3:37:57] <frosty_yaya> As a European I approve
[3:38:00] <%Darren716> No they dont
[3:38:00] <%starotter70> They need it in this industry
[3:38:06] <%korth367> neat
[3:38:06] <T_Sasquatch> It's 23:30 in EU LUL
[3:38:07] <+Zulos77> @StrawberryBandit i'll give it a shot when I coop it with friends later
[3:38:10] <asianbowlofriceakalexi> Thank you from the Europeans
[3:38:21] <StrawberryBandit> @Zulos77 Good luck! androm4Love
[3:38:24] <%MeatClackin> MeatClackin subscribed with Twitch Prime. They've subscribed for 2 months! 
[3:38:25] <%Kirby_Sauce> cheer500 my absolute favorite 3 things to do in mhw is the witcher quest (SnS), bully the shit out of Kushala with queen rose, and use SnS and flight mantle to ride Kirin like a magestic knight! or that one Voltair album cover.
[3:38:28] <asianbowlofriceakalexi> <3
[3:38:36] <ScreamLord> Crash Woolie's Bayonetta LP with Reggie!

[3:38:48] <mr_slaide> Bernadetta MUST be protected!
[3:38:53] <Supathief> moon2E
[3:38:53] <+Grayhammatter> personally, lysithea is my go-to
[3:38:57] <%starotter70> I'm at late game, she's still good
[3:39:02] <%0dokuro> Sometimes shes a shotgun
[3:39:06] <+Grayhammatter> she got some insane damage
[3:39:10] <mr_slaide> She's too pure for this cruel world.
[3:39:21] <%Kirby_Sauce> gross fetishes
[3:39:31] <StrawberryBandit> LUL
[3:39:32] <+Zulos77> toestra is rad
[3:39:34] <+Grayhammatter> LUL
[3:39:36] <+Zulos77> teostra*
[3:39:39] <%ArcanumMBD> is stream ending?

[3:39:43] <reonome> LUL
[3:39:44] <StrawberryBandit> mean :z
[3:39:46] <mr_slaide> Decaying.
[3:39:47] <Tomschiii> @Estuko like i said, i absolutly hate. and even tho there are only 3 or 4 sets that are like that, the sour taste remains and grows. like you only remember the negativ stuff instead of positive ones, you know
[3:39:48] <%Kirby_Sauce> ooofffffffff
[3:39:56] <+Grayhammatter> rude, but ok
[3:39:56] <%JohnElwaysTeeth> paigelguese
[3:40:01] <GamerWorlock> Mustard gas
[3:40:03] <StrawberryBandit> @JohnElwaysTeeth nice
[3:40:04] <mr_slaide> Throw Paige under the bus!
[3:40:14] <CrypticMochi> Which one has the worst eating habits?
[3:40:22] <%Estuko> @Tomschiii you seem to super dislike it a lot, goodness
[3:40:28] <%ArcanumMBD> Elite Dangerous is space trucking sim. If you want space trucking, it's great. Everything else is kinda mediocre
[3:40:28] <+Grayhammatter> paige by far
[3:40:29] <StrawberryBandit> iirc Vaal eats rotten meat
[3:40:29] <Alseid> It's the comfiest, grindiest thing
[3:40:37] <%Darren716> Thats because people get pissy over updates
[3:40:37] <%Sh00s> elite dangerous is FANTASTIC
[3:40:49] <%Darren716> Its an amazing space trucking sim
[3:40:56] <$TheNeedlesD> Pretty much what Arcanum said
[3:41:00] <$TheNeedlesD> thats what it is
[3:41:06] <+Zulos77> elite dangerous has that mech pilot feel
[3:41:07] <%Darren716> Yeah but your ship go up
[3:41:13] <thegreenbenis> Hey Pappy Pat.
[3:41:16] <StrawberryBandit> I want Handler to be the antagonist in Iceborne
[3:41:16] <Greeneyre> Mustard vs. Cake is a tough decision
[3:41:17] <%Estuko> GUILDMARM <3
[3:41:17] <brambobelurkin> guild marm the best
[3:41:17] <+Ikari_Sunshine> yeah
[3:41:33] <Nina96> guild sweetheart best
[3:41:35] <%NWR_James> wait what?
[3:41:38] <%Estuko> FeelsBadMan it's not enough they gave her outfit to the handler, I wanted full character swap
[3:41:40] <%ArcanumMBD> they come to you to join
[3:41:43] <Pompadourius> That's wrong, Mercedes is support B and D in Faith
[3:41:45] <%Kirby_Sauce> like the car?
[3:41:45] <+TunakIn> man guildmarm just wanted to fiuck all the monsters
[3:41:56] <%starotter70> I waited like 3 months and nothing
[3:42:03] <%Sh00s> it's a 1:1 scale recreation of the galaxy. if you want to feel like you are actually flying in space, elite dangerous is the best game for that. it gets boring if you don't set your own goals to accomplish but has a lot to offer if you dig in
[3:42:04] <$ESP_ROOT> !uptime
[3:42:04] <@Moobot> I've been playing this game for how long? Oh only 3h 42m.
[3:42:04] <%Verd_254> Handler tries to be genki but just comes across as annoying most of the time. She also steals out of our item box.
[3:42:12] <%Kirby_Sauce> but then YOU get hit!
[3:42:12] <bonzosan> !uptime
[3:42:14] <+Grayhammatter> pat, SnS is not for the big numbers, it's for the fast numbers
[3:42:14] <%Estuko> @TunakIn I understood that feeling
[3:42:39] <%Tennochief> Teostra is a king
[3:42:42] <StrawberryBandit> @ SnS mains - do you think the range of the weapon is long enough? I hate the short range so mch
[3:42:43] <%Verd_254> Teo looks cool, his SET looks stupid.
[3:42:46] <+H3llspawn2648> Brachydios <3
[3:42:48] <+Zulos77> brachydios has a dildo on his head
[3:42:51] <Caidezes> Get with the times old man.
[3:42:58] <%SolverCODO> Blood and Wine is SO GOOD
[3:43:02] <LeonSteel> Brachy is the coolest
[3:43:05] <%GalacticLatte> Brachy is coming!
[3:43:10] <Retinolgaming> Blood and wine is BIG good.
[3:43:14] <Tomschiii> @Estuko it was done so many times, and it is still a thing nowadays, not just in monhun, and its just frustrating and annoying.
[3:43:15] <+Grayhammatter> cya later fuckers
[3:43:20] <StrawberryBandit> The Leshen sent him to the New World somehow
