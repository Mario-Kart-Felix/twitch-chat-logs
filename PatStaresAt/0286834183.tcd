[1:18:00] <+Skatedeandre> The god hand playthrough made me get god hand
[1:18:02] <+TastySammiches> I mean it's closer to 3 hours but still
[1:18:06] <AtlasMcCoy> To be fair. Would you be more likely to do something some jabroni on the internet told you to do, or your girl/boyfriend?
[1:18:08] <element_of_loyalty> Hullo
[1:18:10] <%Ssaik> I'd absolutely love that if it happened
[1:18:12] <SiegeJay> @angriestpat Any chance PAIGE will do the Phumerian bosses? Headless Bloodletting Beast forced me to co-op
[1:18:21] <Djinnazz> Yeah, it is.
[1:18:21] <LORDSPOOKLEKINS> Pat there are kids who take after YOU
[1:18:21] <hahaa_mod_btw_hahaa> Jabroni
[1:18:22] <Idon__> Some 9 year old is looking up to Pat right now.
[1:18:22] <element_of_loyalty> PEACH IS NOT OLD,SHE IS MATURE
[1:18:23] <$RaikenTB> It's horrifying.
[1:18:24] <+SaltyTheRower> Pats my role model
[1:18:27] <kvnmck94> Its the times man. theyre a popular personality
[1:18:28] <%Remery_> Pat can be my Uncle
[1:18:29] <Darren716> Its creepy af
[1:18:30] <@thenefftw> It's a different kind of celebrity
[1:18:31] <+WhyIDie> you could do worse, could look up to the kardasians or some shit
[1:18:32] <+Skatedeandre> It’s understandable
[1:18:32] <KruelDestiny> Super weird
[1:18:32] <+VoodooLord66> [TROUBLED]
[1:18:32] <kvnmck94> Its "being popular"
[1:18:33] <SainVt> some kid was inspired to steal pies thanks to woolie
[1:18:34] <+certifieddudeistpriest> People should not look up to the Logan Paul's of the world
[1:18:34] <AlasterAngelo> i love jake paul!
[1:18:34] <leinadtonu> Depends on the youtuber...
[1:18:34] <%patriotrenegade> you cant jump that
[1:18:35] <eucyon> a former coworker is SUPER upset that her kids are idolizing Youtubers
[1:18:37] <%SaltyDongs> Its troubling cause the youtubers they look up to are complete assholes
[1:18:38] <+Elexius> Pat, legion of children look up to you, how do you feel?
[1:18:38] <%ThatRandomGuy661> Oh it super is though
[1:18:39] <$GohanEgret> [x] TRUTH
[1:18:44] <element_of_loyalty> :D
[1:18:44] <%jediwatchman11> Pat's the best role model
[1:18:45] <AncelDeLambert> celebrities are bad rolemodels, regardless of the era
[1:18:46] <Idon__> Kids would look down on Pat. Literally.
[1:18:46] <+VanaSkiller> LUL
[1:18:47] <+FaultyJawa> lol
[1:18:48] <kvnmck94> YEAH FUCK THAT KID
[1:18:48] <B_S_H> BCWarrior do what I do children
[1:18:49] <RCtiger0> Just look at Vidcon, kids there are weird
[1:18:49] <%aslfrasle> With Pat's height, wouldn't most 9-year olds be looking down on him?
[1:18:49] <+Worldbrand> i knew friends who grew up looking up to many worse role models, celebrities have always been kinda shitty
[1:18:50] <Aleate> Pat is the worst role model, but that is why he is the best
[1:18:51] <Hydrapissed> Its BAD
[1:18:51] <%Remery_> AWESOME
[1:18:51] <+TastySammiches> he's a good role model if you're cool with stealing and killing and cheating
[1:18:52] <%korth367> could be worse

[1:24:41] <element_of_loyalty> THE LAST OF US

[1:24:44] <Twoiis> Oni is best.
[1:24:45] <deviljhojho94> KREIA
[1:24:52] <+VanaSkiller> thats the one by the hentai artist right
[1:24:53] <Tarkara> @AFlyingTaco1 Elf cant on a Diet
[1:24:57] <Idon__> DETERMINED TO KILL SPAGHETTI HUSBANDO
[1:24:59] <kvnmck94> TellTale Wolf Among Us has it BAD
[1:25:00] <%rdark_ksu> I really like the dark elf myself, but seriously that anime is a smorgasbord of THICC
[1:25:03] <%Ssaik> Agree
[1:25:05] <%MightyHoundoom> Thicc elf girls make my penis become the big penis
[1:25:06] <+guntoad> oh boy LUL
[1:25:08] <%Ssaik> it's so badly done
[1:25:10] <agustorm123> Underpoo
[1:25:12] <RCtiger0> I don't think I had any games shove their morality down my throat
[1:25:16] <AtlasMcCoy> You didnt HAVE to do it
[1:25:19] <AFlyingTaco1> @Tarkara Thank you!
[1:25:21] <AtlasMcCoy> You could have just turned the game off
[1:25:23] <+Haruhi_Sujioka> Spec Ops the Line: War is bad, I am smart.
[1:25:24] <+Enderborn18> PAt you are wrong, the player is not supposed to feel guilty, it's the character
[1:25:24] <emeraldskrull> Spec ops: We did this? No, YOU did this.
[1:25:24] <AirlineFood74> @spiegspikel FROMSOFT barely worked on it. An idiot chatting shit about something they know nothing about? colour me shocked
[1:25:25] <prismaticsnake> it's for the character in spec ops, not you the player
[1:25:25] <element_of_loyalty> Hey big boi
[1:25:27] <$Chimeraelite> I get that way in Falllout sometimes
[1:25:27] <buffmurffy> spec ops is fine, its moer about the character than you
[1:25:29] <spiegspikel> White Phosphorus is a hell of a drug
[1:25:29] <+mechslayer71> WHITE PHOSPHOROUS WHOOPOO
[1:25:31] <%WorthlessSamurai> "You could just NOT play this game that you paid for"
[1:25:33] <leinadtonu> You could stop playing... That's the idea I think.
[1:25:35] <Idon__> The only winning move is not to play.
[1:25:36] <CosmicKweeblo> You can actually do other things than what they tell you.
[1:25:36] <+Elexius> The real winning move is not to play.
[1:25:36] <Kalcom> so like undertale
[1:25:36] <%Old_Logos> yeah u could stop playing I guess. only way to not do the bad thing
[1:25:42] <+Sorathecrow> Spec ops the line
[1:25:43] <$Chimeraelite> Fallout 4 you CAN'T really be "evil" like in NV
[1:25:44] <+paladinstarbuster> same as undertale
[1:25:45] <ramix_the_red> @MightyHoundoom Thicc Elf Girls make your penis become Thicc?
[1:25:45] <kvnmck94> yeah, but then just dont buy that game.
[1:25:47] <$hatesdps> ok pat but thats not a real criticism if you didnt know it before you played it
[1:25:48] <ronyncato87> Or Fallout 3
[1:25:48] <+WhyIDie> so david cage games 🤔
[1:25:49] <GoldeNOVA> THAT'S THE POINT
[1:25:50] <Idon__> MGS2 Colonel "TURN THE GAME OFF."
[1:25:53] <filialpails> you could have stopped playing

[1:26:30] <%jediwatchman11> TOUCH FLUFFY TAIL
[1:26:30] <+arcadeking48> Games that attempt a moral like that always stumble because you are forced to do the bad thing, and then guilt you for it. Undertale manages to do it really well because the terrible thing is your choice, and Nier does it kinda well for spoiler reasons, but Spec Ops is terrible. Removing player agency does not do anything but show the developer's own incompetence
[1:26:31] <gigiaten> PAT YOU SHIT

[1:28:07] <+mechslayer71> @iwishthiswasicq I don’t trust you

[1:28:44] <element_of_loyalty> Pat makes me sick
[1:28:58] <Aleate> Paige is allergic to twitch D:
[1:29:01] <+mechslayer71> @iwishthiswasicq but what is it tho
[1:29:03] <+G_Thunders> can anyone explain this 40/40 meta? I remember him trying to convince Woolie to do the same thing
[1:29:04] <daft_decapod> more like Shiva the Deceased
[1:29:05] <AncelDeLambert> beep honk toot
[1:29:07] <%jediwatchman11> isn't it sad how Dark Souls just shits itself as soon as Anor Londo is done
[1:29:10] <%iwishthiswasicq> @mechslayer71 Do you know what AIM is?
[1:29:12] <%konekoryugamine> Alright I'm back and WHAT IS WRONG WITH YOUR HEEEEAAAAADDDD
[1:29:17] <+potatodono_> so dumb
[1:29:22] <+mechslayer71> @iwishthiswasicq nope
[1:29:31] <+Grayhammatter> super dumb
[1:29:32] <$hatesdps> does the xanthous crown make you feel better about putting your hard steel in a defenceless soft dragon girl
[1:29:33] <Huntercd> Why is Pat wearing a dildo on his head?
[1:29:38] <Shadope342> I give it 1 hour before mustard tornado gets annoying and he takes it off

[1:29:41] <AirlineFood74> THAT DOESN'T MAKE SENSE
[1:29:42] <+Grayhammatter> cause pat is a dildo
[1:29:42] <ramix_the_red> @jediwatchman11 Archives and New Londo are pretty great. Only real bad parts are Izalith and parts of the Tomb
[1:29:44] <+Elexius> like 3.50

[1:30:06] <leinadtonu> Good woman...
[1:30:07] <%iwishthiswasicq> @mechslayer71 Alright, AIM is like Skype without the video chatting and also old and shitty. ICQ is AIM but even older and shittier.
[1:30:09] <%jediwatchman11> ramix_the_red I do enjoy Archives and New Londo. Especially New Londo because it's just Berserk
[1:30:11] <rytisone> Paige is Mathemagician

[1:46:02] <turf_wind_and_fire> ATTAC, PROTEC, BUT MOST OF ALL LOVE
[1:46:04] <%breakfastmagepowers> Traveler Default is a GUD game?
[1:46:07] <+Gouf_Troop> Bravely Defaults finale is amazing
[1:46:11] <+Grayhammatter> octopath is super fun
[1:46:12] <+TsunamiPoro> my cat could beat up ur cat nerd
[1:46:18] <+Nymphonomicon> Elmo eats Pat to gain his powers...
[1:46:19] <wsintai> I like Bravely Default, Bravely Second, AND Octopath Traveller. Does that make me a heathen?

[1:46:31] <$hatesdps> @AngriestPat never ever face zoom like that again i almost died
[1:46:33] <$mandragoraroot> im way too put off by octopaths story structure
[1:46:34] <element_of_loyalty> JINX

[1:46:38] <%breakfastmagepowers> Don't make me clip a second time Pat
[1:46:39] <+Koover> dex / int?
[1:46:42] <+Keiyum> I just got in, and had the same reaction as plague. That's a first.
[1:46:45] <Prevot> remember last stream when Pat fell over and over in this place?
[1:46:49] <SubjectX07x> So what you're saying is the only good cat is a broken one. 🤔
[1:46:53] <%HiroTSK5> I prefer Bravely's battle system almost solely on the fact that enemies have to default to get more turns unlike Octopath where bosses get multiple attacks 'cause Fuck you.
[1:46:53] <$RaikenTB> do a flip
[1:47:02] <+Grayhammatter> pat, you do realize you could have pulled the lever after doing it the first time?
[1:47:02] <getdatdick> octopath has all the momentum of bravely without any of the downtime. i actually really like both bravely games, but octopath is just kind of like. better? it has ALL the speed and fluidity and like big payoffs with no delays, both in battle and storywise
[1:47:04] <Bezzyjezzy1023> cheer200 From my husband, he loves your content and looks up to you. please tell him to stop! lol!

[2:07:12] <AtlasMcCoy> Pat's thirst for violence is too strong. Kicking children in the head isn't enough to satisfy him anymore.
[2:07:17] <AlasterAngelo> @AngriestPat mythology
[2:07:18] <+Tylermcd93> Hindu mythology is pretty cool
[2:07:20] <trixter420> wheres that spider that falls from the ceiling?
[2:07:20] <+Grayhammatter> it is 9
[2:07:21] <SatansDick1> my favorite mythology is the sbfp lore
[2:07:24] <%Tehfiddlers> The mythology he’s created is stronger than any other
[2:07:25] <%Iplatypusprime> is this Anor Londo
[2:07:25] <EMP_Ike_Turner> I like the part in Egypt where the guy jacked it and made the river so the pharaoh had to jack off into the nile
[2:07:27] <%jediwatchman11> Gaelic mythology is pretty dope
[2:07:37] <element_of_loyalty> NEIN
[2:07:45] <%Ssaik> counting with pat

[2:07:51] <spiegspikel> It’s my favorite area in all of Dark Souls, Marlon Brando
[2:07:53] <%jediwatchman11> so is the very very little we know of slavic mythology
[2:07:53] <%breakfastmagepowers> Whatever Mythology that Black Coffin in Africa is from is probably cool

[2:58:13] <%knomad2b> this is plagues legacy. well this and the furries
[2:58:19] <SatansDick1> why is kaaathe so quiet
[2:58:21] <AncelDeLambert> yes, they are BOTH fucking lying
[2:58:28] <%chiluzza> jesus christ
[2:58:28] <$GoCoSpace> @jorgamund he foresaw anime
[2:58:30] <thebehatted> limitbreakers made a vid on the four kings, you can get up to eight kings total I believe
[2:58:31] <+atlasbot1> @PlagueOfGripes Do you think they have primordial serpant dentists
[2:58:31] <%Keyd00d> BECOME AS LORDS
[2:58:33] <AncelDeLambert> lying by omission fucking counts
[2:58:34] <SainVt> but are we gonna become as ugly as him
[2:58:35] <%jediwatchman11> yes they're both lying but your choice boils down to prolong a dying world or just fuckin' kill it with evil dark shit
[2:58:37] <%chiluzza> frampt sounds like plague
[2:58:39] <%XzileGaming> MR BURNS
[2:58:40] <%Jpdodds> I love the phrase "Coddled fire"
[2:58:49] <@PlagueOfGripes> But Frampt. Was a stupid bitch.
[2:58:52] <%Keyd00d> whenever pat isn't talking paige should be asking "why isn't pat talking?"
[2:58:53] <B_S_H> snek gonna do what snek gonna do lie Kappa
[2:58:56] <+atlasbot1> KAATHE
[2:59:05] <YourFalloutCompanion> Serpents gotta Lie, Shteet, Cheel
[2:59:09] <%keksisblyat> @plagueofgripes true shit
[2:59:11] <thebehatted> VORE
[2:59:15] <legendarysabertooth> She had her fingers crossed that you did die
[2:59:16] <%zangetsu_114> LOOK AT THIS VORE
[2:59:18] <blakeway> why'd you skip the vore pat
[2:59:21] <+Finalzero0> spooky sbfpRage
[2:59:23] <AncelDeLambert> welp, so much for trading items for souls
[2:59:23] <randomp141> It looks on par... with Never Ending Story 2's magic dragon.
[2:59:25] <+jorgamund> @PlagueOfGripes what was Kaathe lying about?
[2:59:29] <+ArrogantPrimate> Frampt gonna be so mad
[2:59:31] <AncelDeLambert> YOU MISSED OUT ON THE SHIT EATING, PAT
[2:59:32] <%chiluzza> pat shaming the serpents for liking vore
[2:59:32] <+GreatBrightBlack> Choose Kaathe
[2:59:33] <+atlasbot1> Why did you skip plagues favorite part
[2:59:39] <%altairibnlaahad909> kaathe lies about the benefits of the age of dark
[2:59:40] <theobble> give the abyss kisses moon2KISSES
[2:59:44] <@PlagueOfGripes> Kaathe wasn't lying about anything
[2:59:47] <EMP_Ike_Turner> plague is wise because he knows about Peg from Goof Troop
[2:59:48] <%clausover> kill him
[2:59:52] <%altairibnlaahad909> hes all "oh the age of dark is supposed to happen let the abyss flow over everything"
[2:59:57] <%XzileGaming> Kaathe never lied
[3:00:00] <%olliedelosa> The scythe doesn't match the armor
[3:00:00] <%altairibnlaahad909> but he fails to mention how much the abyss sucks and how much the age of dark sucks
[3:00:00] <legendarysabertooth> @randomp141 haha falcor has seen some shit
[3:00:01] <+GreatBrightBlack> Plague is right
[3:00:02] <@PlagueOfGripes> other than maybe omitting the finer details of what a Dark Age actually involves
[3:00:03] <$GoCoSpace> What does pat still have to do?
[3:00:03] <%XzileGaming> Kaathe did nothnig wrong
[3:00:10] <%keksisblyat> Straight F A C T S
[3:00:12] <+Bt_Robot> How were you holding something larger than your entire body? This has always been incredibly troubling...
[3:00:12] <@PlagueOfGripes> which even 3 got entirely wrong
[3:00:13] <+jorgamund> ok that's what I thought
[3:00:15] <$GoCoSpace> !uptime
[3:00:15] <@Moobot> I've been playing this game for how long? Oh only 3h 24s.
[3:00:16] <+GreatBrightBlack> ^
[3:00:17] <%jediwatchman11> Kaathe doesn't lie he just leaves out how fucked the age of dark actually is
[3:00:19] <ronyncato87> Yeah but you'll go crazy AF if you go all dark tho right?
[3:00:23] <Ell1ot> can you beat up Kaathe and make him run away?
[3:00:24] <thebehatted> but the deeeeeeep
