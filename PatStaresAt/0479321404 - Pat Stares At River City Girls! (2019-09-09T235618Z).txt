[0:26:34] <%ohmacs> @starotter70 "The Hunt" for sure
[0:26:37] <Naho_Saenoki> @chaumiester Usually, I pick whoever has Dragon Feet. (Usually Kunio.) So I picked Misako, thinking she would, too. Turns out she has Stone Hands instead. Stuck with her for consistency, and I LOVE her moveset.

[0:27:36] <Sokumotanaka> @ScreamLord About varying degrees considering they can still get knocked out by regular people and also have to hit people alot to knock them out
[0:27:37] <%GabeSweetMan> Such lies and deceit.

[0:27:52] <+Jaysky> You can't dab away the cars irl?
[0:27:55] <%Sir_Gawain_Lotsson> Any drugs they sell are legal. It's in the name.
[0:27:56] <+GunterDriger6> Can't fault that logic!
[0:27:56] <Hoarseplay> @ScreamLord Nah. Misako gets a wold haymaker.
[0:27:56] <%NeroInfinite> Also has anyone told him the alt colors of the strikers do more damage and have more HP?
[0:27:57] <FirearmsInstructor> @AngriestPat Haven't caught up with the previous vod, but how are you liking River City Random 2019?? :D That is one of my favorite / most nostalgic games. Played it in 1990 and I still have it, but not an NES. :)

[0:28:32] <SirBrawler18> I actually think the Dab fits. It fits Kyoko's personality
[0:28:34] <RC_S3kshun8> Since this one has Chun Li's kicks, does the other character have any cool reference moves?
[0:28:35] <%Sir_Gawain_Lotsson> any smilers in chat? :)

[0:29:18] <Kalinflip> already got the XP
[0:29:20] <%AngriestAngryArtist> some moves are goddamn worthless unfortunately.
[0:29:32] <SirBrawler18> Misako has Karin Guren Ken, and Alex Powerbomb
[0:29:37] <Naho_Saenoki> The only weapon worth picking up os the yo-yo, I noticed. You can juggle people to death with it.
[0:29:38] <Sokumotanaka> "Oi josuke!"
[0:29:41] <%DexteraXIII> That's like, 20000 cents
[0:29:46] <%TundraOW> Misako has a powerbomb?
[0:29:48] <%AngriestAngryArtist> there is no good rhythm to the combos you try to do.

[0:30:07] <SirBrawler18> Yep, her air grab
[0:30:08] <%TundraOW> Can you score a hoop by throwing them
[0:30:10] <%NeroInfinite> The yoyo is the only worthwhile weapon if only because of the juggles
[0:30:11] <Redmannasah> The lead pixel on twitter said one of these cars would've had a skeleton inside smoking, but they had to censor it for some reason
[0:30:13] <%Ion_Laser> Come on and SLAM
[0:30:15] <Hoarseplay> @Naho_Saenoki You can juggle people to death with most weapons. It just requires stricter timing and sometimes microwalking.
[0:30:15] <+Jaysky> The best weapon in the game is the body of your fallen enemies
[0:30:23] <Redmannasah> animator*
[0:30:25] <%GabeSweetMan> I think Pat's play has dramatically improved in just the last 2 minutes.
[0:30:28] <reinbachthe3rd> DAB
[0:30:28] <%NeroInfinite> China hates skeletons

[0:30:36] <%Razputin217> River City Gaiden
[0:30:46] <groovykrovvy> almost a hoop
[0:30:47] <%waltzqueen> That would be rad!
[0:30:48] <+Jaysky> China can't hate skeletons, they have skeletons themselves
[0:30:50] <noobpsyboticus> what's up you fuckin boomers
[0:30:53] <%starotter70> Skeleton's can't smoke in Japan
[0:30:54] <%GabeSweetMan> That feels like it SHOULD be an achievement...
[0:30:54] <Salami_express> can you back throw into head stomp?
[0:30:59] <%Dementedpenguin> @Soul_Intern I'm reminded of jotaro smoking during the card game LUL
[0:31:06] <Naho_Saenoki> I just bought the game today, and I wanna say that I LOVE how the game immediately addressed the whole Mami/Hasebe thing.
[0:31:13] <Tennochief> I found nothing
[0:31:15] <SirBrawler18> Totally think Dab fits Kyoko's character

[0:31:45] <Coylie3> I've been having problems with calling allies in. Like, sometimes they just say "no"
[0:31:49] <%alexandrecau> chinese people are the only human being to have succesfully removed their skeletons and live without it, therefore they see representation of skeleton in game as obscene
[0:31:50] <+textandnumbers> A Yakuza-like with River City characters would be great.

[0:41:37] <Strider222> NO MERCY
[0:41:38] <%Anime_Flux> No guard rails, no warning signs, just oncoming coasters everywhere!
[0:41:39] <%Scrub_Seeker> that is the worst design for a roller coaster ever, of course it's in a video game
[0:41:41] <cureneckbeard> Kyoko never killed anyone

[0:42:46] <%Anime_Flux> 410 billion cops
[0:42:48] <Too_Much_Nukie> @AngriestPat The guitar hit noises actually form a song if you get 10+ hits. Only doable with huge crowds though.

[0:44:02] <Coylie3> Money you get from bosses and quests is shared across characters, if you wanted to give Misako a try

[0:44:26] <%AncelDeLambert> TUNA BAT
[0:44:26] <%ElenaManetta> This game has really pretty colors
[0:44:34] <Too_Much_Nukie> The XP share in this is fucking weak though, so Misako will be a MUCH lower level.
[0:44:39] <+Shackle_Rustyford> @MelBrooksKA is at least one of them the composer from crypt of the necro dancer because holy shit
[0:44:40] <%Laecerelius> damn vague authority figures!
[0:44:42] <hericknhx> I beat the game last night and is so fun when you unlock Kunio and Riki Kreygasm
[0:44:46] <reinbachthe3rd> Don't beat up Josuke!
[0:44:46] <Too_Much_Nukie> Best to just try the other character in NG+.

[0:45:07] <%BioApple> The only composers I know are Megan McDuffee for the vocal tracks (and possibly most of the rest?) with chipzel doing the super-chiptune boss themes
[0:45:08] <arkaznor> It looks more like a trout then a tuna.
[0:45:10] <hericknhx> @Too_Much_Nukie there's a trailer for both character lmao

[0:45:24] <Tennochief> @Too_Much_Nukie I wouldn't say it's a spoiler, when they've already been shown on the website
[0:45:26] <Coylie3> @Too_Much_Nukie Oh yeah, and the scaling makes it so underleveled characters have a harder time. I'm learning that now after beating the final boss.

[1:22:35] <%RubberFistFight> @xeros720 there's an epidemic of hearing loss in Japan because of how fucking loud pachinko parlors are, and the attendees don't bother with earplugs for some reason.

[1:24:00] <WarchiefGoldva> So you're staling the Yakuza's lunch money?

[1:32:36] <Tennochief> well not exactly
[1:32:37] <+Th3SmartAlec> Maybe if you read more than one comment every time.
[1:32:40] <%moogleboy1984> it's HALF of what's needed for the secret boss
[1:32:41] <zamzoph> @AngriestPat just do it without collecting first
[1:32:41] <%goose_attack_almanac> @Flameking he got it
[1:32:42] <%theAncopro> yeyeye
[1:32:43] <WarchiefGoldva> @AngriestPat No, pat. They are lying to you. You need to fight the final boss first, the secret boss can't appear before then.

[2:03:29] <+justianxix> Good shit LUL
[2:03:30] <Onmi_Khaos> In 90% of the games they are the girlfriends, in ONE game the RCG's were the girlfriends
[2:03:30] <Cherokia666> timelines are stupid. Nothing is consistent
[2:03:30] <SleepyMaribo> Hasabe and Mami are the canon GF's
[2:03:31] <%TundraOW> Is the ending different in the Japanese dub?

[2:03:32] <%Ion_Laser> HOES MAD
[2:03:33] <aeonicvector> @AngriestPat I interpreted itas a dumb timelines gag + they were exes not current GFs
[2:03:33] <WarchiefGoldva> You know what's fucked, though? In the game Misako and Kyoko are introduced, they get fucking SHOT. With a GUN.
[2:03:33] <+joekuta71> What happens when you play the boyfriends?
[2:03:33] <Dark_Wint3r> Hoes mad
[2:03:33] <%jiin6> Nothing changes
[2:03:33] <%DedlokPM> They may be the current girlfriends or also "We think we are" girlfriends
[2:03:34] <+chrishnaw> The real boyfriends were the combos we made along the way.
[2:03:35] <deviljhojho94> CHRIST

[2:03:41] <deviljhojho94> LUL
[2:03:42] <%Sir_Gawain_Lotsson> THEY'RE LITERALLY JUST STUPID
[2:03:44] <agadejobi> The ending is a big meta NTR joke
[2:03:44] <%FirearmsInstructor> @AngriestPat ... I JUST got the 16 bit game reference... I feel Paige-slow D:
[2:03:45] <Wan6Saber> Jebaited cause you were the enemy all along
[2:03:46] <SirBrawler18> Kunio and Riki's loss. These two are waaay cuter
[2:03:47] <Hoarseplay> Mami, yes. Hasabe, kinda but not really.
[2:03:47] <+TrevSmith222> Mami was the one you saved in River City Ransom.
[2:03:48] <RantingRavager> WHAAAAAT?
[2:03:51] <hung_tu_long_fong> hair ribbon?
[2:03:52] <SleepyMaribo> the reward for beating them is the worst
[2:03:52] <Sokumotanaka> ARE WE THE BADDIES!?
[2:03:54] <%RubberFistFight> WHO DOES NOT WANT TO WEAR THE RIBBON

[2:04:03] <+chrishnaw> 83%?
[2:04:04] <%goose_attack_almanac> @AngriestPat Mami is canonically Riki's girlfriend. But Hasabe and Kunio have never been together.
[2:04:04] <+alphonseisbest> wtf even is that endding??
[2:04:05] <Too_Much_Nukie> @AngriestPat The hair ribbon is the ribbon Misako wore as a child.
[2:04:06] <Tennochief> well we did it I guess
[2:04:07] <KillianST> kunio
[2:04:07] <%TundraOW> KUNIO

[2:04:15] <%worldbrand> dojo money
[2:04:16] <%theAncopro> literally Makoto
[2:04:17] <%Laecerelius> Lots of money
[2:04:18] <SleepyMaribo> the hair ribbin increases the speed at which you revive your partner, in a local co-op game...
[2:04:19] <SquigglyLizard> 5k muns PogChamp
[2:04:19] <ergheisu> you murdered everyone for literally no reason
[2:04:19] <hung_tu_long_fong> what's hair ribbon do?

[2:04:29] <itesket> B E S T
[2:04:30] <mayorrev> cracked phone

[2:04:33] <groovykrovvy> heh, busted up phone
[2:04:36] <KaseKaizer> co-op mechanic
[2:04:37] <Too_Much_Nukie> It's a co-op item.
[2:04:37] <%arancet> thats a coop thing
[2:04:37] <%TundraOW> It's a co-op item
[2:04:38] <%BioApple> increases revive timer
[2:04:38] <WarchiefGoldva> What's MAX fucked though, is that in the game Misako and Kyoko are introduced, they get fucking SHOT. With a GUN.
[2:04:38] <%Starlight_Gamer> Kunio and Riki arent that interesting of fighters
[2:04:39] <%NeroInfinite> That's for like 2 player mode @AngriestPat
[2:04:40] <ShichiNoBushi> 2-player feature.
[2:04:41] <PKHTjim> Revive rate?
[2:04:43] <etnoika> Honestly this ending kinda ruined the game for me. I was getting readybfor all kinds of shippy fanartvof the girls and boys.
[2:04:43] <%razielhex> angel escape is for co-op so you can be revived easier
[2:04:43] <mistspade> Go to the other dojo we didn't hear his lines

[2:04:52] <+Spinningrobo> @Starlight_Gamer what are you talkin about they're both nuts good
[2:04:52] <%theAncopro> also theres a new collectible in new game+
[2:04:53] <SleepyMaribo> @AngriestPat speeds up revival time, which is useless in this game sionce theres NO online co-op!
[2:04:53] <ergheisu> we expected nothing and they delivered even less
[2:04:53] <PKHTjim> Was that a flash kick?
[2:04:54] <%GabeSweetMan> Buy moves
[2:04:59] <%Divryne> Guys Pat doesn't know what NTR is.
[2:04:59] <hung_tu_long_fong> so wait, beat the game now as the guys?

[2:05:49] <StonerStan101> Why does that look like a missing KOF character?
[2:05:51] <krymzen5> they do?
[2:05:54] <Admiral_PopnFresh> So Kyoko is like a combo of Chun and Cammy, right? who does Misato take after?
[2:05:55] <%Starlight_Gamer> Maybe because they are in my game low level.
[2:05:56] <%worldbrand> yo that's cool
[2:05:57] <%hawk_rush> maybe they'll do something with the DLC
[2:05:58] <Marpolo13> Harder punch LUL

[2:06:26] <%Laecerelius> Kunio better have some Kiryu moves

[2:07:22] <KillianST> hot blooded
[2:07:27] <%TundraOW> Lower level?
[2:07:30] <%worldbrand> is that because he's level 5?
[2:07:31] <xeros720> that and food
[2:07:33] <+Skwizgarr> he has no stats,
[2:07:34] <Tennochief> not really
[2:07:35] <Too_Much_Nukie> That's just because their AGI stat is low.
[2:07:36] <groovykrovvy> WAKEUP PUNCH
[2:07:37] <xeros720> you need to buy food for stats for them
[2:07:37] <aeonicvector> The guys also cant combo as well inatley, so they are harder
[2:07:39] <kingkeldeo31> he also gets a tastu at level 12
[2:07:40] <%theAncopro> ooh yea only lvl 5
[2:07:40] <Admiral_PopnFresh> Kiryu's colors, moves remind me of Guile, but with at true DP
[2:07:40] <+Fynale> @AngriestPat he's slower cuz you haven't statted him up with food and levels
[2:07:42] <StonerStan101> She is on Yakuza characters level?

[2:07:53] <%RubberFistFight> @Ion_Laser yep. only I was wrong, it was only the boys bathrooms. Which makes it worse, really.
[2:07:55] <ne0bunny> the air throws are really strong on each character. do a combo ending with down heavy then jump forward and press heavy+special. its so good
[2:07:56] <SydSavage> Those dead fish eyes Kreygasm
[2:08:00] <%GabeSweetMan> HOLY F**K
[2:08:02] <+asgard147> limesPoggers

[2:08:27] <%TundraOW> Can you play as the boys in NG+ or just in loiter?
[2:08:31] <Hoarseplay> I guess that's more like Screw Upper, now that I think about it.
[2:08:32] <%RubberFistFight> @jobbedbone so why didn't they remove the doors off the stalls in the girls bathrooms then? Why only do it to the boys ones? If they're trying to save lives, then shouldn't it be gender-indiscriminate?
[2:08:33] <Marpolo13> we did it!
